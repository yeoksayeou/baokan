<h3>國大對憲法旅行　負監督促成之責　第二審查會通過增列一五二條</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕第二審委會十四日晨開最後一次會，李彬主席，首就昨已通過之「一四九」條重付討論，鄧公玄等發言，認爲國大應有解釋憲法權，主在條文內增列，並應規定立法，監察，司法三院代表參加人數，修正通過憲法之解釋，由國大互推十五人，立法，監察，司法三院各推五人，合組憲法解釋委會，以司法院長爲主席。旋對「一五〇」及「一五一」條熱烈討論，續有修正，朱惠淸等捉在「一五一」條後增列一五二條，並通過其條文爲「制定憲法之國大，負監督並促成憲法施行之責，其代表任期至依據本憲法產生之國大集會之日終止」，此條關係代表任期，朱等曾一再發言，最後戴天球等臨時提案，制定憲法之國大，在開會期內設監督憲政實施委會，其辦法另訂之，下午于時散會。至此，第二審查會審查「國民大會」及「憲法之施行及解釋」二章之工作，即吿竣事。</p>

<h3>潘公展早戀憲草　制憲不在條文之我貴乎切合實際　憲政政府一年內可組成</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕國大代表上海市參議會議長潘公展氏，頃發表渠對於憲草之意見，首謂，就余所知，憲法爲一國革命所得之結果，乃一般人民因革命後獲得應享權利及規定應盡義務之紀錄，同時亦爲的束政府與人民共守之典範，故憲法固不可不含有若干理想，但其理想必爲最近的將來，可以實現者，否則母寗偏重於實際，庶幾憲草之逐章逐條，切實可行，與其有二三百條高遠難行之憲草，不如有二三十條平實易行之憲草也。吾人參加制憲工作，但求於最短期間，即能制頒若干條，人民所必需，政府所必要之憲草，較之遷延時日議而不決者爲益多矣。</p>
<p>潘氏繼謂，中國憲政時期之中央政府，一面固力求其民主化，但一面仍須使其賦有儘速辦事之權力，方可期望日近於「萬能」。余希望人民與政府，在憲法頒佈以後實施憲政之初，能在法治規模之下，使民主政治在中國能鞏固其基礎。</p>
<p>潘氏又謂、五五憲草及此次國府提出之憲草，各有其特點，但目前之憲草，乃根據經各黨派之協商之原則而修訂者，較易爲各方所接受，頗望大會於各方交換意見之後，有更好之修正，使之益臻完善，大致立法院與國民大會未來之組織與職權，立法院與行政院之關係，及中央與地方之權限等，如有較好之安排，則此决憲法常可期其切實可行。</p>
<p>潘氏認爲此次國大進行期間，各代表討論熱烈，審查則又異常精細，雖間有爭辯至面紅耳赤或影響秩序者，但此爲各國議會常見之事，不足爲異。潘氏並預料中國憲政政府，在一年以內，當可依據憲法組成。</p>

<h3>華北冀魯豫晉等省　青年黨成立黨部　劉泗英發表對憲草意見</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕靑年黨秘書長劉泗英，十四日對記者談：（一）靑年黨已在華北冀，魯，豫，晋等省建立正式黨，黨部組織與國民黨大致相同，分省黨部，市黨部，縣黨部三種。此外，並於全國劃分數督導區，劉本人即華北督導區負責人，平市黨部主委爲鄭獨步，律市黨部主委劉靜遠，冀省黨部主委朱德武。靑年黨自本年度起，已在各地公開活動，僅共產黨區尚未能轉爲地上活動，平市黨部現已在東四大院胡同辦公，現各地正辦黨員登記，黨員確數未悉。（二）靑年黨素主軍隊國家化，故軍人中雖亦有靑年黨員，但本黨仍　其受中央指揮。劉於答記者問中，否認劉文輝爲靑年黨員，僅爲同情靑年黨。並稱：一二八淞滬抗戰，係靑年黨發動，翁照垣即靑年黨員，東北方面亦有靑年黨義勇軍。（三）靑年黨對參加國大並無歧見，靑年黨國大名單，係曾琦，李璜兩位親交與蔣主席者，李璜決非言政治病。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕劉泗英十四日發表對憲法意見稱：（一）今日憲草並非靑年黨一黨意見，但旣爲政協通過，本黨在道義上當予以支持，如此次國大對政協憲草有重大修改之處，本黨當保留意見，繼續奮鬥，一個政黨爲一種主張，堅持十年廿年是很平常的事。（二）公職候選人，須經考試，乃剝奪人民之選舉權，應予取消。（三）總統雖可有緊急處分權，然此權擴大及財政方面，不妥。（四）立法院不好爲常設機關，因立法委員爲各地區選出，一年赴京開兩次會，已經要費去很多時間</p>
<h3>共黨憲草　內容分五點</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕外傳共產黨己擬一憲草，準備於召開「人民大會」時提出，頃此間官方發表，該憲草內容即爲根據四月間共產黨在政協所提之關於憲草之意見所擬成，其重要點有五：（一）承認將主席爲中國之最高領一袖，並願奉三民主義爲建國之基本原則。（二）國大代表國民黨最多不得過三分之一，共黨佔三分之一，其他黨派無黨派佔三分之一。（三）省縣長民選。（四）省可在不抵觸憲法下制定省憲。（五）成立聯合統帥部，以統率全國軍隊，此聯合統帥部由各黨派人員聯合組成之。官方並稱：共產黨準備先于公布，以對抗國大。</p>

<h3>保障新聞記者生活　憲草審查會議決提大會討論</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕國大新聞記者職業團體代表包明叔，陳康和，唐奇，凌紹祖等，爲使新聞工作者之生活及其工作獲得國家之合法保障，特於日前向國大提議將憲草第一百四十五條「敎育科學藝術文化工作者之生活及其工作條件，國家應保護之」一條，予以修正，於「科學」二字之下，加「新聞」二字，業經審查會議決，交大會討論，可望通過，茲錄該提案所述理由如下：新聞記者，在革命抗戰過程中，犧牲若十性命與血汗，以求達其任務，取仁取義，指不勝屈，宋漁父，黃遠聲，不少歷史事實，新聞報道與社論時評，白紙黑字，一經刊布，無限責任，甚至禍福立至。抗戰時期，新聞從菜員出入戰塲，身陷虎穴，飛機，坦克，槍林彈雨，死傷俘虜，何止千百，即時局太平，新聞記者必須以畫作夜，發現新聞目標，不論遠近遲早，風雨炎寒，責任所至，不許徘徊，新聞記者須具跑得餓得之體格，說得寫得之人才，而橫遭白眼，備受揶揄，尤爲家常便飯，處處環境惡劣，日日促其生命，請看無數靑年記者，落得幾個白頭報人，其工作之勞，生活之苦，不在勞工之下，而絞腦用心，比任何職業爲甚，國家應予特別保獲，事屬至當，擬請於憲法條文一百四十五條「科學」之下，增加「新聞」二字，請予公決。</p>
<p>滬市商會電國大　請決定建都南京</p>
<p>〔又訊〕上海市工商會昨電早國民大會云：「據報載，憲法中之建都問題，人各一詞，紛議未決，本會以爲，首都爲政治中心，必與經濟中心相附麗，唐代雖建都黃河流域，然重心實在江淮，自安史以及藩鎮之變，常賴江淮之漕賦，以爲戡定之基礎，河翔三鎭，雖囂然不靖，而梁益之間，安然無恙，當時有揚一益二之稱，唐宋以後，東南形勢益　全局安危，元明兩代雖建都於北平，然漕運中斷，則首都立危，故河運海運之安全，與元明之邦計相終始，足似政治中心與經濟中心不能配合，如人生之癱瘓。元明兩代，正坐此弊，覆轍不容重踏，擬請體規明代黃宗義之　籌，近遵國父之過敎，決定都南京之計。至謂建都北平，足問國防，似亦未歸，明自東棄大寗，西割東勝以後，九邊迄無寗日，迄至嘉靖之際，京師尤歲歲被兵，股鑒不遠，何足取法，淸在未立約互市以前，京師之能安於磐石者，由於藩離鞏固，是以堂宇宴然，今者勢易事移，科學發明，國防形勢，亦復改變。又目前民意機關按照近代議會政治良規，必容納各階層之人物，使之從容諷議於一堂，以符全民政治之實際，應請於憲法中，除採區域代表制度之外，兼採職業代表制度，庶幾人人有爲國自效之機會，至深企禱。」</p>
<p>職業界貢獻彌大　代表應列入憲章</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中國國民黨上海特別市執行委員會主任委員方治旣委員陳寶驛，莊鶴礽，沈春暉，葛克信，周斐成，載時熙，謝大荒，陳保泰，王先靑，錢劍秋，周學湘，謝仁釗，陶百川，駱淸華，徐鳴亞，吳開先，張曉崧，昨上電國民大會，臚舉理由，請於憲章中加列職業代表。蓋八年抗戰，各職業單位所發揮之力量至鉅，對國家之實獻彌大。再就此次鈞會參加之份子而言，職業代表亦佔有相當席數，職業團體今日能參加制憲，若將來竟不能參加行憲，此不特於法於理兩俱乘違，則揆之人情亦有不合。用敢不揣固陋，電陳一得之見，務乞根據事實情理，於憲草之中加列職業代表，俾使他日之國民大會確能代表各階層之意識，而使之普遍反映於國策之中，以共同行憲，共同建國。</p>

<p>自日本投降以迄鮑萊調查團實地視察之期間，東九省工廠之損失，的計二十億美元。破壞情形中，有幾許爲聯直接造成，有幾許將歸咎於掠奪，內戰及蘇聯佔領之間接結果，則未能準確佔計。無論如何，蘇聯政府必須負其重大資任。藉口搬出之物資爲「戰利品」性質，爲補償國內受德國侵略損失所急需，均不能充份掩飾事實。例如朝鮮之情形完全不同，朝鮮工業實際無重要搬移或破壤，此可爲蘇聯政策具有遠大軍略作用之明證。若謂蘇聯自東九省搬運所獲得之利益原可以日本本土之賠償代替之，亦不能自圓其說。除工業搬移之外，蘇軍復沒收價値的三百萬美元之金條。本調查團雖未能發現直接證據，證明蘇聯曾援助柬九省巾共，但蘇聯並未妨碍巾共，亦屬實情。蘇聯所鹵獲之日軍大批軍火與彈藥；且曾在蘇聯有意無意的合作下，落入中共之手。復興東九省工業務須記取東九省實際被蘇聯整個或局部控制下之領土所包圍，致使此一廣大區械，易受蘇聯進一步之侵入。蘇聯在東九省短時期之戰役，不能使蘇聯政府以東九省日本資產之大部份作爲賠償，其他國家亦有權利提出要求。總之，蘇聯在東九省沒收與搬去存糧。機器，同時及以後造成之破壞，使當地生產幾乎完全停頓，中國人民受害極大，全不顧及，凡此均足證明，在蘇聯行動之後，有畏時期的軍略理由。蘇聯不僅在工業上破壞該區，甚至鼓勵中國暴徒掠奪，並在其搶刧時爲之攝成影片。</p>
<h3>不顧中蘇條約規定　大連實際已被封鎖</h3>
<p>鮑萊續稱：蘇聯自東九省接收大部份電力設備，實騐工廠，實騐案及醫院，以及最新式與最佳之機器工具，不僅房屋與建築物設備被搬去，如發電機，開礦抽水機，致電流停止，礦穴被水淹沒，損失不貲。電力設備之搬走，使現有一切工業生產停頓。各大城市白來水與排水工程，因電力不足無法活動。一九四五年八月中蘇條的規定大連如自由港，蘇聯僅有權利用該港設備之一部份，中蘇聯不顧條約規定，實際加以封鎖，以供己用。蘇聯對東九省破壞情形可以美元估計如下：</p>
<p>電力：二萬一千一百萬元</p>
<p>煤斤：五千萬元</p>
<p>鋼鐵：一萬三千一百廿六萬元</p>
<p>鐵路：二萬二千一百卅九萬元</p>
<p>冶金工程：一萬六千三百萬元</p>
<p>非鐵質礦業（煤礦除外）：千萬元</p>
<p>液體燃料與潤滑油：一午零三十八萬元</p>
<p>化學品：一千四百萬元</p>
<p>水泥：二千三百萬元</p>
<p>紡織：三千八百萬元</p>
<p>紙與紙漿：七百萬元</p>
<p>無綫電，電話與電報：二千五百萬元</p>

<h3>聯總電覆周恩來等　分配物資無不公　中共再電要求出席聯總理事會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕周恩來一董必武四日曾致聯總署長賴伽第亞，提出下列三項建議：（一）要求直接在中國「解放區」進行救濟工作；（二）未動之物資爲中國「解放區」撥出合理部份交由「解放區救濟總會」會同聯總分配之；（三）十二月十日在華盛頓舉行之聯總理事會，應邀「解放區救濟總會」代表出席。聯總副署長路克斯於九日覆電”表示「解放區」之救濟工作，正在進行，至出席聯總理事會事，則稱己轉知中國正式代表團李卓敏處理。中共代表團接此電後，認爲不公平，於十三日再致電聯總署長及理事會，再度請將中共要求提理事會討論。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中共「解放區救濟總會」駐滬代表伍雲甫·成潤等，昨在思南路周恩來公館招待記者，發表十二月十三日周恩來董必武署名之電文二通，一致聯總署長賴伽第亞，一致賴伽第亞及理事會，此二電係　對路克斯將軍來電拒絕考慮中共之提而議發。</p>
<p>路克斯之覆電</p>
<p>〔路透社南京十四日電〕將於十二一月三十一日起繼任聯總署長之路克斯將軍，（現爲副署長）爲中共批評行總對解放區分配救濟物資不公事，特於今日電周恩來及董必武聲明公平分配聯總物資，繼續爲聯總在華之堅定目標。並日：聯總駐華辦事處，對克服運輸上及其他困難，以究成前項目標一點，繼續極度注意。聯總駐華辦事處及行總均謂正採取積極步驟，以發展並使用可供應用之交通錢，將物資輸人需要之區。路克斯將軍複謂：關於救助黃河區居民之事，已有肯定協定，想此一對中國有重大關係之計劃，已可順利完成。路克斯將軍之電繼謂關於要求聯總「解放區救濟總會」成立協定一點，茲悉後者駐上海行總之聯絡員伍雲甫君，經常與聯總及行總保持接觸，接治「解放區」之救濟事宜。並悉各地解放區救濟總會官員，對於供應品之分配事宜，並均積極參加，深信此項措施對解放巨之效甩，必能日見增增加。至於閣下要求邀請「解放區救濟總會」閣下要求邀請「解放區救濟學會」派代表一名參加聯總第六屆理事會會議事，已向中國首席代表李卓敏提出，但來電所　各節，當不致在聯總第六屆會議中討論</p>
<p>周董兩氏去電　周恩來及中共「解放區救濟總會」會長董必武，獲路古斯之電後，己覆電賴伽第亞，　路　斯實未了解中國關於救濟事務之政治歧成，及分配不公允之嚴重性，而路克斯之拒絕將我方陳述之點，向聯總第六屆會議提出討論，本身已構成歧視及不公平之行爲，實屬萬分遺憾，吾人認爲由聯總會議討論此事，實爲　國善救工作嚴重狀態之最滿意的解決，故吾人不能不再度提出此一請求云。</p>
<p>周董兩氏致　伽第亞之另一電報中，有謂：前經　總　　　　處職員三百人所揭露之在華善救工作黑幕，如貪污，以善救物品從事內戰，分配不公允等，迄未稍有改善，聯總所訂不得有政治歧視之基本政策，並未遵行，解放區救濟總會雖在上海行總辦事處派駐聯絡員然以該員一無權力，故不得視爲局勞已有改善。再就公允分配善救物品問題之本身言，實爲一極度迫切之事云。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕聯總當局希望於一九四七年度開墾中國水淹區域農田二百萬畝。此乃聯署最後財政年度主要計劃之一，計劃中規定修築河南·安徽·山東各省內之黃河堤岸，防止水汛，而利種植。此項堤岸係抗戰時期炸燬，以阻日軍推進。聯總正在解散中，但對五三五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元之對華計劃，完成尚不及一半，在中國軍事與政治局勢許可之範圍內，當予以完成。</p>

<h3>我正與菲當局協商　華僑自謀建市場　要求菲化法案暫緩實行</h3>
<p>〔中央社馬尼刺十三日電〕據當地公正人士之觀察，欲求菲化市場之命令得到一斟酌之解決，必須應用公正之原則，兩國應相互承認彼此間之困難，並考慮歷史背景及現在華僑在菲所居特殊地位之含意。此次發生共和法案第卅七號之法律問題，即公共市塲國家法案，其中授權財政部，制定管理市塲規章，市參議員於最近一次會議巾，指出財政部爲行政機構，而非立法機構，無權對制定此項法令。再者，任何國際法或其他法律，均不能忽視業已成立之事實，歷史載有一項事實，即華僑於百年以前，已在菲市場經商，在西班牙統治菲島時，華僑已積極在市塲中從事商業活動，經過若干年艱苦之奮鬥與工作，最後始於此等商業之中，完成繁榮之事業之事業隨時日之　遞．菲人對此種業重要之認識，漸進入一新階段，雖曾企圖　華僑攤販競爭，但一再失敗，當美國統治菲島時期，菲人屢决欲以法律將華僑驅　市塲均未如願，現在菲人由於此種妒忌心理，乃從事制定法律，以徘斥華僑於市塲之外矣。羅哈斯於十月一日僉署此法令，其後，菲方官員一再宣稱，此法令並非岐視或意欲排斥華僑商販者，但結果華僑攤販，有爲財政部所公佈法規之限制而被迫退出公共市塲之危險。菲當局此種突然之命令，無疑將使在菲之守法華僑一千零四十五人及渠等家屬二千人，感受嚴重影響。除法理問題外，當地公正人十，又提出另一間題，即所採之行動是否即可達到發起人等所理想之目的。羅哈斯總統希望該法案能更鼓勵菲人從事零售之商業，俾能與外人作更有效之競爭，但實際上華僑在菲島之整個市攤中，僅佔百分之十，且在菲島之市塲商業上，實際並不屬於控制地位，拒絕此項法案旣不可能，唯一出路只有建立華僑自己之市塲，此爲羅哈斯所允許，且以後爲季里　所建議者。聞我使館將設法獲得　議會之特准，或與菲政府取得行政上之協議，批准華僑得以自行經營其市塲，同時要求菲政府延遲實行該法案，直至華僑之市塲巳經建立時爲止，如此種辦法失敗，則華僑最後只有被迫　國際法院起訴。</p>
<h3>海防設華僑中立區　我正嚴重交涉中　越人之不友好行爲有增無已</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕關於海防設立華僑感受生命財產上之威脅一事，頃據外部歐洲司司長葉公超稱；我對海防設立華僑中立區之要求，始終未更變主張，因目前　越爭端並未圓滿解決，我僑胞將繼續感受莫測之威脅，政府現正向雙方嚴重交涉，力促中立區之迅速劃定。</p>
<p>〔中央社河內十三日電法越關係惡劣之際越南政府當局，雖迭次聲明保護華僑，中越親善惟自海防諒山法越衝突發生以來，據各方報吿，越人對華僑態度，已日越惡劣，越政府當局雖無排華之意圖，但在海防諒山河內等地，越人仇視華僑之事實，己屢見不鮮。海防力面，法越衝突時，華僑被越軍越　無故捕去者達三百餘名，越南政府最近復以時局不靖爲詞，更大舉在各地搜查華僑住宅商店，無故逮捕我僑胞時，即指爲與法軍通同反抗越政府，或竟指爲土匪，僑胞之領有我領館所發證明書者，亦不被尊重。我駐河內總領事袁子健，以法越衝突中，華僑巾立地位，應爲雙方　　重，曾向雙方要求設法保護華僑安全，法越雙方當局，亦再申明盡力保護，事實上華僑被越人　　　　僑住宅之　搜查者，仍日　　聞，越人對華僑之不友好行爲，仍有增無己。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>挽救工商業的前提</h3>
<p>談到政治，大家便不的而同地感到，現在最大的癥結，是在於各方面的不合作。假如國共眞誠合作，則一切軍事，財政，經濟，交通等等問題，早己迎刃而解，年餘以來，一切復員工作，其成績決不會在戰敗國以下。</p>
<p>政治如此，經濟也何獨不然？工商業的危機，日益深刻化。各方面都在竭思焦慮，想找到牠的病源所在，希望對症發藥，施以一個緊急有效的治療。無奈百病俱發，頭緒太多，覺得一綹亂絲，無從理起。有許多人因此發生悲觀，認爲前途太不光明。大家覺得，抗戰期間，雖然百孔千瘡，艱苦備嘗，但人人面前，總覺還有一個最後勝利的影子，隱約在前。無論如何困難，依舊可自寬自解，不至墜人迷惘和失望的境地。惟有目前前的經濟情形，眼看牠日趨嚴重，崩潰在即，却沒有一個光明的影子領導在前，也沒有一個確切可行的辦法，可資解救。便不期然而由焦慮以人於迷惘，更由迷惘而似乎入於失望，絕望。現在大部份的工商業，不是在盲目地努力掙扎嗎？前途的營業方針，能有多少成分具有可靠的把握？</p>
<p>那麽，牠的病源究竟何在？有沒有辦法，可以把牠挽救過來呢？這個答案，似乎並不難找到。因爲仔細地考查一切，便覺一切的毛病，也和政治一樣，都從不合作這一點上發生和滋長起來，從而對症發藥，也祗須從合作這一點上做起，便小難日起有功。這裏且舉幾個事實來證明一下。</p>
<p>大家知道高利貸，高工資，高稅率，這幾個高字，是現在工商界的致命傷。但是就高利貸說，並不是眞的沒有壓低的辦法。供求律吿訴我們，祗須銀根寬裕，融通便利，那麼，拆息自會平落，一般工商家，如果能照四五分的低利，從銀錢業借得到的話，又何必向拆票公司等，去借二角乃至三角的高利貸？問題就在這裏，四五分的低利，實在不容易借得到。借得到的非許以較優惠的條件不可。而調劑盈虛的商業行莊，實際又沒有充分的籌碼可以周轉，有充分籌碼的，又因爲其他種種理由，不便隨時供給頭寸。供給了頭寸，又會花樣百出，造成了許多意外的罪惡，諸如糧貸，囤貨，投機，轉放高利貸等等，時有所聞，最近某綢廠借到了十萬萬，竞以一倒了事。從此看來，在供給方面，雖然各式貸款，名目繁多，但其數量，其方式，是否可平高利貸？在需要方面，是吾點滴歸公，一齊用在正當的用途上？這些疑問，似乎雙方都還沒有仔細考慮到。就是說：雙方都沒有開誠合作，想把本問題求一個有效的解决。只不過枝枝節節，零星應付，搪塞目前而己。似此一曝十寒。各打各的算盤，那麼，高利貸怎會平得下去？</p>
<p>其决談到工資，一般的說法，總覺得現在的工資，比起其他一般的薪給來，似乎太高了些。拿國內外的物價比較起來，也覺得國貨的成本太高了些。但是如何减輕成本，如何調整工資，現在還是一種理想。換句話說：所謂勞資合作，從大體說來，至今還是一句空話。</p>
<p>再其决是高稅率問題。這裏還包括種類太多，和種種類似捐稅的負擔在內。如果說：當局堂高簾遠，不知道這種痛苦，那未免厚誣了他們。不過牽於事實，未免顧此失彼。在急於吃鷄子的時候，就顧不到雞的生命了。倘能轉移目光，從單純收入這觀念，兼顧到租稅政策乃至保育政策，就是說：官商眞的通力合作，來解除現在工商業的危機，那麼，這是舉手投足之勞的事情，其實並非十分困難。</p>
<p>除了上面這幾個高字之外，還有外貨傾銷，私貨猖獗，運費昂貴，原料不繼，動力不够，管制失當等等，也都是造成經濟危機的重要因素，但也並不是沒有對策。所可扼腕的是：一面努力解救，一面暗中破壞，一面忍受犧牲，一面從中漁利，一部份的經手人員，更不顧死活，上下其手，專替個人打算盤。以至一切良法美意，統通攙雜了其他私利和作用在內，或是口是心非，陽奉陰違，或是改頭換面，名有實亡，所謂橘踰淮而爲枳，終於得不到預期的效果。所以現在工商業的危機，並不是沒有挽救的辦法，患在各方面沒有作的誠意，以至有法而不能辦，或辦而不能澈底，如果要求奏效，第一，當自各方面切實合作始。</p>

<h3>一個苦幹的縣志館</h3>
<p>編者先生：在這政治動盪經濟紛擾的氣氛裏，社會人士，不是爲生活而掙扎，便是爲利欲而奔走，文化事業，早已被人忽略，尤其像志書一類的文事，久有「迂開莫爲」之感！</p>
<p>最近筆者回到久別的故鄕—杭縣塘棲鎭—在這數方里面積的市鎮上，最近成立孑一所杭縣縣志館，而且館內會集許多當地知名積學之士，孜孜不倦地埋頭著述，可謝是現代文化界一個奇蹟。縣志館址在該鎮運河南岸晚步弄毓川書熟樓上雖逼近市心，却無塵囂，倘無人指引，不易找到門徑。裏面高爽淸幽，几明窗凈，佈置幾架書　寫字台之外，祇掛數幅當代名流勗勉性的題詞，案頭故紙堆中，反映質樸簡單的情調。館長汪堅靑是位謙和的長者，他對筆者說：「縣志失修已經二百多載，經時代的演變，縣市的劃分，山川異勢，文獻放佚，要繼往開來，修志實爲當務之急，陳縣長文很鄭重地聘人立館，積極進行，目前已核定了纂修大綱與分年進度表，循此編纂，對於與地·物產·水利農田，有關民生切要事類，非特要實地考查，更須用科學方法，說明理解，證實事功，仿章實齋陳玄嬰的虱範來寫這部新的志乘，我相信用來做去，一定可以完使命。館內編纂先生一位姚竹府孝廉，他曾充鹽業報社長，任中華書局編輯多年，他的詞章著述，課本敎材，文化界早享盛名，曾與陳三立朱疆村輩頡頏一位管偉之貢士，他編過海寗志及其他著作，亦斵輪老手。此外担任編纂的駱憬甫許客卿諸先生，俱是史地·物理·商業·農事的專門人才。陸副館長漱石，過去在黨政界夙負盛譽，今獻身文化事業，亦爲一時之選。一方面還繼續就本縣訪聘鴻碩，以求完成一部毫無遺憾的志書。」</p>
<p>末了，汪館長很誠摯地對筆者說：「本館創辦伊始，經費不多，但是鑒於社會在由破壞到建設時期，大家不下一些苦幹功夫，國家前途是沒希望的所以本人和館內各位先生，本此意識，雪纂風鈔，不辭艱苦；過去雖不能執干戈以衛國家，現在惟有奉筆桿兒爲本位，以盡一份國民天職。』筆者此次返里，親見到杭縣縣志館的學院氣派和苦幹精神，十分飲佩，特介紹出來，供都市中的文化鬥士們以興觀感，藉以鼓舞向上云。　（學初）</p>

<h3>聯大辯論裁軍案　美英蘇一致支持　貝卿報告美海外駐軍不足五十五萬　莫洛托夫發言反對保守原子彈秘密</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十四日電〕聯合國大會昨日辯論裁軍問題時，美國務卿貝爾納斯發表演說稱：美國駐於國外之軍隊不及五十五萬人，其中一萬九千人係應由中國政府之請，駐於中國。此外大部份駐於德國，日本，朝鮮，奧地利及維尼齊亞求里亞。除德奧美軍佔領區外，美國僅在菲律濱中國及巴拿馬運河地帶駐有「戰鬥部隊」。貝氏否認美軍之留駐中國，對於和平係屬一種威脅。述及原子武器問題時，貝氏稱，「如其他國家同意原子武器之管制及監察，則美國願與其他國家共享製造原子武器之智識。茍其他國家並無原子彈或不能製造，則彼等對於管制及監察制度，自易表示同意，原子能委員會應儘量加速工作。要之，吾人欲與各國結合，共同維護和平而非從事戰爭。吾人欲加加國際公法而使文叫世界上之各國人民，獲致自由與幸福。」</p>
<p>英外相貝文繼起發言，贊同貝爾納斯之主張，調「英國現有軍不足一百萬人，可謂極少。以言原子管制，各國倘抱有政治成見，則原子能委會不能獲致解解決方案。總之，吾人隨時準備向聯大供給任何需要之情報，藉以貫澈憲章中之各項原則。」</p>
<p>〔本報紐約特派員十四日專電〕聯合國大會昨日討論普遍裁軍問題時，美英蘇三國均表示全力支持。蘇外長莫洛托夫繼貝文發表演說，並未宣佈蘇聯國內外軍隊數字，但一再要求對各國軍隊作全面之調查。莫氏繼謂美國保守原子彈秘密，足以威脅世界和平。就原子彈之性質論，係使用於他國領土，並非作防禦之用，而顯係一種攻擊武器。關於普遍裁軍一案，莫氏重申蘇聯要求，調查世界軍隊情形，必須宣佈各會員國軍隊駐地及其所負使命。莫氏演說畢，大會宣吿延會至翌日上午十一時，屆時再討論蘇聯之調查軍隊要求。</p>
<h3>政安委會通過　普遍裁軍方案　軍隊調查未成立妥協　將送回全體大會覆議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十三日電〕聯大政治及安全委會今日一致通過普遍裁軍方案，但關於軍隊調查案，則以廿九票對四票決定提付安理會討論，蘇聯獨表異議。調查之折衷案乃大會主席史巴克所提出，親定安理會及早決定邀請會員國提出何項報吿，但蘇外長莫洛托夫在大會全體會議時，準備再度力爭，美國務卿貝爾納斯亦考慮就此問題發言。英外相貝文在本月十四日啓程返國前，亦將偕同代表團出席。軍隊調查問題之重心，乃蘇聯堅持全部軍備報吿，包括原子彈在內，應附於國內駐軍之任何報吿。蘇聯在其提案中，則僅要求調查國外駐軍數字。另有一項複雜問題，乃英國要求常塲核對此種報吿，故委員中對此不能妥協。</p>
<h3>設國際監察機構　安理會草擬方案</h3>

<h3>否決權問題　澳洲議案通過</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十三日電〕聯大今日通過澳洲代表之提案，即敦促安理會常任理事在使用吾決權時，應避免阻撓安理會之迅速有效工作·該案以卅六票對六票通過，另十一票棄權，中國亦在棄權之列。顧維鈞在表決前宜稱，中國政府目前反對將憲章作任何修改，坊能尋得一種方案，爲安理會全體會員國所接受，則中國政府準備贊同，但此一時機尚未到臨。</p>

<h3>中央公司一客機　離京飛滬忽失蹤　載有自平運滬鈔票若干箱　除機航人員外乘客僅兩人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央航空公司旅客機一架，昨日午後二時許，自京來滬途中，突吿失蹤。該機下落，迄今晨二時屬稿時止仍未能判明。綠中央航空公司前日有C-47型卅一號航機一架，自北平飛來上海，途經南京時，因氣候惡劣，即停歇南京明故宮機塲過夜。該機裝載有自平運滬之鈔票若干箱，在京時並搭載旅客二名。昨日午後二時，該卅一號航機由飛機師馬某，副飛機師張某駕駛，帶司無綫電員某，由京起運來滬。原定昨日午後二時四十五分可抵上海，詎在起飛以後，該機即與京滬兩航站失去無綫電聯絡。從比下落不明，迄晚未有端倪。嗣據向中央航空公司機航組負責人探悉：距該機由京起飛卅分鐘後，另一架中央公司航機、曾在來滬途中，接獲該卅一號機之無綫電訊，唯亦未窺見其行蹤或去向至於該機是否係在途發生障故致被迫降落等情，則迄晚尙未能判明。卅一號航機中除馬，張，鐘等三機航人員外，所載旅客僅有在南京上機之二名。</p>
<h3>中美航郵中斷　郵局邦辦　解釋疑問</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近來中美問航郵忽然中斷，美國方面自十月中旬以後，即未接獲中國方面寄去之航空郵件。因此旅美人士及商業行家紛紛來電詢問，疑慮叢生。記者昨特走訪本市郵政管理局王裕光帮辦，叩詢航郵中斷之原因。據稱中美間航空郵件之寄遞，向來須經馬尼拉郵局轉手，自上海至馬尼拉由中國航空公司飛機裝遝，自馬尼拉至舊金山則由汎美航空公司飛機裝運。現中航公司滬菲班期飛行如常，故航郵運至馬尼拉者仍源源不斷，所以發生中斷之現象者，係由於馬尼拉方面之躭擱。據聞其原因爲汎美公司飛機停航之故，但詳情究屬如何，上海郵局曾於二星期前去函詢問，迄今尚未獲覆。十二日去電追詢，俟覆電來到後，常即公佈眞相。至於補救之方，則因中美間航空綫僅此一條，故暫時尚無辦法，一切當視馬尼拉方面情形而決定。</p>
<p>注意防止偷竊郵件</p>
<p>記者復詢以最近外傳有不肖之徒偷竊信筒中郵件拆閱內容後、向收信人或發信人詐騙財物之事。工氏認爲並非事實。因不久以前報載此項消息，並有捕獲偷竊犯數十人之說，當時郵政當局即向警備司令部方面詳細查詢，得悉並無其事。據彼所知，僅有一次，有一竊犯乘郵差投遞信件之際，於郵包中竊取若干信件而行騙。該案破獲後，已令飭郵差今後加以注意。王氏繼稱十年前本市郵筒式樣爲上大下小，信件往往堆塞於上部，致被人用鐵鈎等物鈎取後偷竊郵票。後經發現即予改成現時式樣。竊取信件等情形，當然現尚不能絕對保證其無，但不少信件之失落，由於寄信人之遺忘或僕役之疏忽者，亦數見不鮮。故如市民確有發現信件被拆閱，並因此而受詐騙者，可將詳綱經過報吿，郵局方面決予儘量追究而求防止。</p>

<h3>生產貨款　條件可以放寬　俾使生產復蘇　貨款審核會霍寶樹氏發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪新任生產學業貸款臨時審核委員會主任委員霍　樹，詢以有關生產貸款之問題多則，當荷分爲解答，茲誌其大要如决，渠稱：政府此次舉辦生產貸款，目的係針對目前工礦事案之病態，對症施以急救，使生產事業得以復蘇，故貸款時將着眼於生產成本之減低，俾利產銷。委員會刻已擬就申請貸款之原則草案，以備爲申請貸款時之遵循。將來該草案通過後，凡申請貨款各廠，合乎該原則之規定者。均得申請貸款。渠望每一申請者，應儘可能發揮本身固有力量，勿純賴貸款資助。同時，獲得貸款後，更勿以本身固有力量，浪費於非本身業務之範圍內。據渠研究結果，我國一般工廠，應積極改善其管理制度，以生產成本言，目前利率高翔，其在整個工繳中所佔之百分比，遠較戰前爲膨脹，故高利貸當爲戰後生產成本激漲原因之一。獲得貸款各廠，果以所得貸款償還舊欠，而能因此減低生產成本者，當亦可加以考慮。故對過去貸款須以原料成品作抵之硬性規定，亦可望設法放寬。此次貸款申請方式，可能由各廠個別申請。核準後，可由各廠原有之往來商業行莊承貨，並準由各行莊向中央銀行隨時辦理轉抵押。但與組織銀團之中小工商貨款，並不悖。至貨款之各項章則，渠稱將　量利用現胡之成規，加以必進。同時，貨款處審核委員會每週　將召開會議三次，幫此後貨款溴　申請至該發，相信時間不致如以前之冗長。至貸款總額，瑞尚定奪，　視各廠實際需要，儘力供給。惟所切盼者，即貨款所得，務九使分　納入生產途遙云。</p>
<p>又據四聯總處副秘醫長刁民仁語記者：生產事業貸款，旨在扶助正當之當產事業。故獲得貸款者，應充分使貸款利用於生產途徑，切勿挪作他用。現正靜候貸款審核委員會於下週一召開會議，以便決定進行方針。渠稱：過去向四聯分處申請之貸款案件，亦將一併提交該審核委會集中辦理。至貸款利率，將視各廠負担情形，而稍有伸縮，惟最高不致超過五分云。</p>
<p>聞生產事業貸款臨時審核委員會於下週一召開會議後，將公開招待太市新聞界，報吿該會今後工作方針。</p>
<h3>謠言平息　金鈔股一致回跌　金價跌至三一〇萬　美鈔跌入六千元關　股票全部掀起跌風</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕烚赤昨以報載，國際貨幣基金會，下週接受會員國匯率，仍以官價爲準則之訊，人心對奢望稍受打擊，加上央行力壓而吿回跌，晨開時尚在三二七萬左右，開後即被迫後退，浮多獲利了結，而退入三二〇萬內，但買戶仍有浮動，不久復吿回漲至開盤綫，央行遂以三二五萬之價，配給一百條，始起回風，加之央行隨市管制，買方心理動搖，賣風轉盛，十時後央再後退，近午破入三一〇萬大關內，見三〇八萬低價，始漸轉穩，午刻在三一三萬以上掙扎，午後適　週六，無甚成交，結果較前收回降十二萬元，飾金亦退至三十三萬，紋銀銀元均平，暗拆尚平，息價一角二至一角半不等。　外幣極度混亂，美鈔晨初尚在六三〇〇元左右，後以金價回跌，買戶稍吿觀望，午刻降至五八〇〇元買，六〇〇〇元賣，午後逢週六無甚變化，結果較前收回跌四〇〇元，港票上塲曾抬高至一三〇〇以上，後隨金市回降百饞兀，結果于較前收回小一五〇元，港匯昨以申電跌至七五元，高價曾成交一三〇〇元，後在一二〇〇元左右，英匯一九二〇〇元，印匯一四六〇元，交易仍不見暢。</p>
<p>公債昨徘徊不定，各債榮辱互見，統丙晨開一三六〇元，三六〇室有售，五三三室六〇四室則進，高價未逾一四〇〇元，低價亦不過一三二〇元，最後在一三五〇元至一三七〇元間徘徊，結果較前收跌五十元，甲乙升二十元，統丁升三十元，統戊則平，成交的二百餘萬元。</p>
<p>華股昨以紗花帮大戶泰半出籠，獲利之存多亦吿脫手，急切回瀉，近午散多慘吿潰散，信和遂繼火柴大通宣吿停板矣，晨開尚在前收之上，但遞永紗開盤極爲混亂，五七〇元及五九〇元爭執難決，遂以五八〇元折高市價爲開市價，開後二一二號奮力抬價，在極度混亂中，遞永紗復拉高至六〇〇元大關外，一五一號一九七號二三二號逢高脫手，回跌亦速，二一二號七六號四四號八三號九一號一一五號九一號均進，尚易回漲，但六〇〇元大關，此後即難越出，三六號二二三號一五一號一四五號七六號八九號一〇九號等均售，十時二十分後、開始下降，惟多掙扎，十時半起，金市回瀉，人心轉法，一五二號六一號二二四號二二號一〇七號七六號紛紛脫手，跌風　熾，火柴大通首先跌停，加上二二九號一九八號力售遞永紗市况在恍惚中逐步下游，近午散多慘跌潰散，二二九號一九八號一五二號一八五號爭二一二號忽來賣出，人心大法，於是遞信和亦吿跌停，兩永紗同時破入五〇〇元大關，午收稍盤，較前收計永紗信和亦吿跌停，兩永紗同時破入五〇〇元大關，午收稍盤，較前收計永紗信和景福新光華豐各跌一成至一成半，勤興跌二成，冷股大通火柴跌至停限，麗安五和尚穩餘均跌一成左右，遞交永紗美亞跌一成，信和新光景福勤興華豐各跌一成强至一成半不等，場外各股，尚形穩健。</p>
<p>外股昨亦吿回跌，惟熱股跌勢較鉅，純受金鈔影響，結果較前收計業　微挫，會德　怡啤跌半成光景，航業紙業鋼業各跌一成弱，怡紗英聯各跌一成以上。</p>

<h3>央行重申黃金政策　盼勿輕信謠傳致受殃及</h3>
<p>頃據央行方面表示，黃金配售，仍然大量供應，連日本市掀起漲風，實爲投機者，從中興風作浪，官方仍本旣定方針辦理，並無絲毫變動，此種人爲之影響，第一投機者自遭打擊，第二市民紛紛爭購，亦將殃及，第三厥爲一般商業銀行，故希望一般市民對所有故意興風興浪之傳說，認定係投機者故異玄虛，勿自貽伊戚。</p>

<h3>上月份僑匯又減　走私商套購其數甚大</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據有關人士之估計，十一月份之僑匯數字，較之十月份又見减少。其主因爲：（一）美鈔黑市價格大漲，而官價依然；（二）華南走私數目，未見减少。今日往往有由美國一地匯至另一地之匯票，郵寄廣東，以略低於美金黑市之價格，售與走私商人者。每月此種損失，官方估計達一千萬美元之巨。根據中國銀行之統計，去年勝利後之半年內，每月之僑匯高至五百萬美金，今則形勢變更，每月僅有二百萬美元左右，且有減少之趨勢，識屬可慮。又外傳港埠之外商銀行有以高利息吸收我國僑匯之說，記者詢之於某銀行實務專家，體朋不確。因寄至華南之僑匯，極大部份均爲家庭之用款接濟，而非用以作投資或投機者，過去某國家銀行曾在廣州設立分行，擬以較高利率，吸引僑匯，但結果殊不滿意，即爲明證。</p>
<h3>粳糯米價步高　雜粳豆餅銷暢價昂</h3>
<p>昨日米市南北到貨共計一萬一千餘石，各鋪戶均有備貨，是以消化蟬聯，市面逐步向榮，南粳猛漲一三一千元，北粳亦續加二千餘元，秈米跟漲三千元之　，白元冬節在邇，去路轉暢，回漲二三千元，陰元則狂躍三四千元，麵粉因內地價高，來貨爲少，暗暗上升，麩皮亦升二百元，但消化頗少，黃豆交易熟鬧，價格上漲三五百至千元不一蠶豆依然平定，赤豆仍乏上落，芝蔴貨稀挺秀，粵方續辦，盤升一二千元，生仁高料尚活，中下仍呆，形勢仍在盤旋之中，豆餅匯頭台　福建均有成交，價格步　，　漲三四百元，油市供求尚衡，動蕩頗少，生油早疲午堅，結果平定，豆油高貨微升一二千元，中下平正，蔴油店胃香燥，價漲三四千元。</p>
<h3>經營僑匯爲主　中行海外分行密佈</h3>

<h3>業貨款　開始貨放　總額百六十億元</h3>
<p>電機絲織業貸款辦法已經四聯總處核定，交通中國兩銀行於十一月廿五日起開始貸放，絲業方面已辦理申請貸款手續，與中交兩行分別簽訂合的，是項貸款四聯總處核定爲每台電機三百萬元，十台以上者始可向巾交兩行貸款，十臺以下者則由工商貸款銀團貸放，十臺以上之絲織廠計三百餘家，計有電機五千五百臺，共計貸款一百六十億元，絲織業之押品爲原料成品，成品不得超過五成，其折扣按市價七折計算云。</p>
<h3>美國訂貨進口困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕十一月十七日前在美訂貨之處理問題，迄未獲得解決。據可靠方面消息：此批貨物，包括已啓運及合同已訂立者，數量甚爲鉅大，如允許進口時，央行須供給大量外匯頭寸，因關係重大，已向政院請示。且因申請者多，而輸入管理會人手不修，遲延在所難免。又悉此批貨物性質亦殊複雜，例如美國某大無綫電公司曾與我國某公司訂立合同，由後者承銷二萬個收音機，截至今日爲止，僅運來一千個；但在進口規定中，無綫電收音機即在限額進口之列，申請入口許可頗爲困難。據悉一部份有高度優先入口之貨物，則已匯傳許可，只待進行幸關手續。</p>
<h3>商要從處人求寬理</h3>

<h3>青島在冬眠狀態中　「劫收」和戰亂的賡續存在　戕害了青島工商業與文化</h3>
<p>— 十一日航訊　本報青島特派員杭舟</p>
<p>海風呼嘯，飛砂走有，「避暑勝地〕的靑島，已經在冬眠狀態中。這冬天，是比以往更爲寒冷了。自從抗戰勝利，在勞山打遊擊的李先良氏率領了他的部隊接收了這個城市，便一直處在被共軍封鎖的狀態中。冬天，北方人民生活必需的煤，來源便非常缺乏。雖然，市面上還可以發見這黑色的賽物的蹤跡，但每噸卅餘萬元的價格，只好成爲華麗的公館中的裝飾品，普通市民己無福消受。十二月八日，一夜狂風，八萬餘流亡的難民中有二百多名因凍餒而昏暈過去。這祇是一幕「小小」的悲劇而已，使美麗的靑島留下無法抹去的汚跡的，該是「接收者演出的那許多醜劇。魯豫晋區接收淸查團團長郭仲隗氏發表遇這樣的談話：「靑島接收舞弊爲全國之冠！」</p>
<h3>訪李市長他說：主管人很難做</h3>
<p>李先良氏是現任靑島市長。抗戰前，他是靑島特別市黨部的主任委員；在勞山打遊擊時代，兼代了市長。在那個時代，他着實苦幹了一番。他與所有打遊擊的同志）樣，同甘共苦，出死人生，勝利了，他正式被任爲靑島市長，帶了一肩行李，走馬上任，現在，他住在豪華的前日本領事館裏。記者到百島以後，便去拜訪他。我被接待在一間精緻的會客室內。沙發與彈簧椅的套子是淸一色的藍絨布，賞心悅目。溫和的暖氣。鮮艷的窗帘，隔絕了外面水凍的世界。李市長穿着一套春裝，笑容可掬地談到一些問題。那天，恰是美國眾議院海軍委員會議員艾塞克等五人離靑飛津的一天。他先談起關於招待外賓的事說：「靑島是一個國際都市，單招待外賓一項就够費心思。外國人很注重第一次印象。如果招待他們用中餐，須要使他們對中國風味留下一個非常優美的印象。所以，菜與酒的鮮美，杯盤的精巧，都極重要。」他提到昨晚參加中央海軍訓練團招待美議員的宴會：「他們顯然是第一次　到　國風味，大聲讚好，但我喝了那些酒後，今天還有些不舒服。」</p>
<p>記者表示：「李市長在這一年來維持靑島的局面，的確不容易！」</p>
<p>他很有風度的笑了一下：「但有些不諒解我的人正對我大肆攻擊。中國的事往往是這樣的：主管很難做！譬如，關於接收的事吧，我手下有些人做了錯事，都算在我的頭上！」因這件事，他特地去了一次南京，回來後，赴各處視察，似有積極整頓一下市政的決心。但他另對人這樣感慨地說：「我手下每個人都有關係，我辦那一個好呢？」</p>
<h3>青島接收舞弊爲全國冠　移法院的案子卻僅八件</h3>
<p>隔了幾天，我在市政府會客室　會見了市府秘書長姜可訓氏。他對郭氏的談話有如下的批評：　這裏有兩個問題：第一，全國　敗收舞弊到什麽程度？第二，靑島接收舞弊到什麼程度？郭氏並　真全國接收淸查事宜，所以一　　　難有個比較。再，靑島　收舞弊旣爲全國之冠，但淸查　多途法院的接收舞弊的案子只　八件……。」言下似有「與「國之冠」四個字不大符合」之　八件案子，我特地去地方法　詢了一下，其中五件業已起　，三件尚在綫密偵察中。</p>
<p>已起訴的五件對象是：（一）中紡青島分公司第一印染廠課長李達五、辦事員徐炎培。（二）靑島市政府委員兼公堂事業管理委員會主任秘書呂廣恩與該會組員王子敬。（三）經濟部特派員辦公處接收專員朱先栽。（四）中央信託局房產組辦事員關鏡海。（五）靑島市黨部委員兼黨政接收委員會委員馬錫珺。尚在偵察中的三件對象是：（一）國民參政會參政員張　古。（二）市黨部委員邱瑞基。（三）市政府職員孫振有。</p>
<p>舞弊案犯　中下級人居多</p>
<p>其中比較　動的是關於張樂古的案子，在一般市民的口頭，張樂古是：「靑島接收三巨頭之一」。關於他的「偷犬換日」的手法，傳聞很多。現在他巳被拘押在地院裏，不准會見任何賓客。法院處理這件案子，似乎特別　重。首席檢察官丁書恪氏吿訴記者：「大的還有兩個星期可以起訴了。」</p>
<p>「郭團長的話，我想不是隨便說的。」當記者訪問山東高等法院第二分院院長楊昌第氏時，提起郭仲隗氏談話的確實性，楊氏這樣說：「至於舞幣的人，大概以中下級爲多。靑島當時接收的情形如何？我沒有看見；但我知道的是：當時所用的叭，大半是「就地取材』。在上者如果不嚴厲地防範，阻止舞幣的發生，甚至加以默許，那情形便不可收拾。」他因而談到前政治風氣的敗壞：「環境每每逼迫貪汚現象的造成像州島這樣一個繁華的都市，做官而不坐汽車，而不能西裝革履，而沒有各種豪華的享受，彷彿就不能見人，被認爲　子。當許多人都已經有了那種享受時，少數人想避免，想改變，幾乎是不可能的。」他才從濟南回來，他說濟南要比靑島樸素得多，所以濟南接收的情形亦要好一點。他又說：「現在做官的人只有兩種：一種是優子另一種是別有作用的人。此外，沒有第三種人。像法院裏一個推事的收入，只够一家人吃窩窩頭。這些人便都是優子。我們只能用私人的感情去維持。否則，當推事的出去掛牌當律師，受理一件案子的收入，便足以超過一年推事的薪俸。」　記者來靑一個星期，爲了找尋房子，發現了這城市關於房屋問題的一些「秘密」。我幾乎可以這樣說：「靑島市處理敵僞房屋的混亂，亦是中國第一的」！在上海，我知這曾經有一些」强有力」者非法佔用房屋，但始終是被認爲不合法的。然而，在靑島則一切强佔者槪予承認，無形中鼓勵了强佔的風氣。敵僞產業處理局的一位職員說得妙：「只要住房子的納租，政府的收入有了，誰住？反正一樣。」於是，靑島市便有一個人佔住十幾幢房子，周時，亦有許多人找不到安身之處。「房荒」！「房荒」！　嘴的鸚鵡　樣呌着。有一個房屋考核分配委員會，是應付申請者的一個機構，有名而無實。會內至今還沒有一本淸册，那些房子未辦手續，或那些房子已辦手續，都像猜謎一樣。有一位先生好容易分配到了一幢房子，那裏面早就有人住着，請他們「搬家」，他們伸出手說：「拿錢來」！於是，這位出不起「請搬家費」的先生只好住旅館。</p>
<p>最危險期已過　戒備迄未鬆</p>
<p>靑島軍事上最危險的時期已經過去。最危險的時候是在今年夏天。那時共軍已攻至靑島的水源地，市內兵力單薄，岌岌可危，但共軍沒有胆量乘虛而入。徐州綏靖公署第二綏靖區副司令官兼靑島警備司令了治磐指揮了一些保安團隊艱辛地應付過了這個危機。現在，外圍已漸在拓展。膠濟路是山東的一條大動脈，經路局搶修之下，即可恢復通車。此路一通，靑島的被封鎖狀態可吿解除。</p>
<p>但放棄和談的共軍正在軍事上準備新的行動。在膠濟路兩側，尤其是以南地區，以臨沂爲中心，集結的共軍不在少數，隨時有對膠濟沿綫各都市發動雙擊的可能，以遂其擴大軍事割據的企圖。負責　濟綫治安的廿集團軍總司令夏楚中氏日前來靑，曾對記者說；「國軍遵守停戰命令，決不主動攻擊，惟共軍如來犯我，則我必有以應付。」故以靑島而論，此刻仍在戒備恐懼中。「突擎抽查戶口」時常舉行。除了早己實施的午夜戒嚴外，十二月五日起並實行海上戒嚴，禁止一切民船進出。</p>
<p>征兵額一千名　年內辦理竣事</p>
<p>本年度，靑島應徵的兵額是一千名，以種種意外的原因，迄今尚徵集六百餘名。徵兵是依照中央法令辦理的，由市長在全市及齡的壯丁名額中抽出一千個名號，因恐有逃避的事端，保甲長在名單揭曉的晚上，帶了繩子至每一個抽中的壯丁家裏吿訴說：「你應該履行最光榮的義務了！」其間，自然不免有所驚擾。而若千保甲長乘機買賣頂巷等不法的現象，靑島亦時有發現。尚未徵到的三百餘名，聞決在本年內辦理竣事。</p>
<p>公營民營工廠　什九尚未復業</p>
<p>「劫收」和戰亂狀態的賡續存在，是對靑島工商及文化的莫大戕害。據統計：敵僞時期，靑島共有公營民營大小丁廠四千餘單位，現在復業的不及十分之一。而商塲景况更見慘淡。貨物大都來自上海，加上一筆可觀的運費，除了發「刧收」財與一些特殊人物之外，收入較上海允低的小市民如何購買得起？在街頭，你可看見大小商店店面的油漆均已褪落，正如它們門前的落葉一般凄凉！</p>
<p>青島徒有美麗外光　像是個「彈性女兒」</p>
<p>三面環海，一面靠　山，靑島徒有其美麗的外表。有人一樣說：「這兒是沒有文化的。「走進書店一看，所有的書籍都來自上海，而這些　書籍，却有十分之九是屬於黃色性質的。本地沒有出版一本像樣的雜誌。代表文化的幾張日報，內容貧乏而枯燥。有的報紙的」專電」，竟全部抄錄上海報紙，一字不改。</p>
<p>我獨步在黃海之濱，靜靜地走過那此海水浴塲，我來到了中山路盡頭的前海棧道，竚足觀望，海風呼嘯，海浪洶湧。這兒是被稱爲遠東有數的海軍　地，但中國的新海軍尚正在襁褓之中。此刻，美海軍士兵，一批批上岸遊要，吉普車風馳電掣地通過寂寞的柏油路上。舞廳，酒吧間，　啡館，只有美水兵上岸的那段時間是然鬧的。奇裝異服的女郎擁着一個水兵又一個水兵。於是，我想到給靑島一個適當的形容詞，稱之曰：一個「彈性女兒」！（十二月十一日於靑島冰凍的夜晚）</p>
<h3>臺南大震　勘災小記</h3>
<p>— 九日航訊　本報駐臺記者楊育</p>
<p>本月五日上午六時四十五分，臺南市東北約八公里處的新化，永康一帶，發生了劇烈的地震，最大震幅一公分以上，總態動的十分鐘，在人體上的感覺時間，也有一分多鐘，霎時間房屋倒塌，鐵道橋樑被毁，死傷的三百七十餘人，全部係被建築物傾壓所致，哀聲獨地，不啻人間地獄！</p>
<p>震源是永康，新市與新化的一塊三角地帶，其中以新化受災最重。震源一帶，有數處地面突然開裂，土地或凸或凹，其距離竟達二公尺左右，附近之道路，甘蔗園，花生豆園間，有數十處噴出黑砂泉水，最長者達二十公里。</p>
<p>台南市與新化的鐵道，受損甚大，全長十一公里中，的八公里受劇震，鐵軌或曲或斷，同時鐵路橋樑亦有兩座被震裂，交通遂吿斷絕，經鐵路員工搶修，復因此綫係雙軌，故火車於當晚五時，仍照常通過。合南市自來水幹綫（埋於新市，新化間者）亦受震有四處裂開，故目下台南市水源吿斷，的須一星期始可修復。嘉南大圳無恙，對農田灌漑亦無影響，誠亦可謂不幸中之大幸，日來省方巳派員馳赴災區，勘察詳情，指示善後辦法，並發放實物，慰問災民，救濟總署台灣分署亦派醫師携帶藥品前往各災區施行受傷者之救治。</p>
<p>查臺灣地震，最劇烈之一次，係民國二十四年月二十一日上午時零二分，在新竹臺中方面所發生者，死傷計一萬五千〇一名，房屋倒壞五萬五千棟。第二次係民國三十年十二月十七日上午四時十九分在嘉　發生之地震，死傷一千〇二名，房屋倒壞一萬五千餘戶，另朋顯著之崩山，此次臺南地震之慘重，可謂僅亞於以上兩次劇震而已。</p>
<h3>棉姑娘行路難</h3>
<p>— 鄭州六日航訊　本報駐鄭記者范世勤</p>
<p>鄭州爲什麼在戰前是個有名的商埠？記者住在鄭州一年沒有看出來。是不是因爲巍峨的隴海花園被炸成廢墟了？是不是因爲平漢路往北去的一段被「扒路軍」扒平了？是不是因爲花園口堵口還沒有堵成？還是一位什麼樣的大老　去世了呢？或是一位什麼樣的紅小組衰老了呢？我始終沒有找出一個答案來。　最近，因爲要添了一條棉被，不得不注意到棉花身上去，於是我常常問問攤上擺的棉花商，車上運的棉花客，才知直棉花對於鄭州的重要，才知道：有棉姑娘才有鄭州。</p>
<p>各界爲棉棉花忙</p>
<p>前幾天，鄭州的棉花還是二千五百元一斤，這幾天已經漲到三千元了。說：最近正是棉花上市的時候，從上海來一些大商人已經到了鄭州來收購棉花，火車爲着運棉藥化忙，銀行也爲着辦棉花押匯忙，一個市塲的交通界金融界都要爲這棉花忙，這棉花就在這市塲吃香了。　安陽是產棉的區域，前些時候，十分之七的產棉區是在共軍手裏，最近那些地方已經收了回來。據說：今年安陽產棉三十萬担。在抗戰中，我們在鄂北，鄂北最大的出產，也就是棉花。那時，除子淪陷區外，全國產棉第一位是西北，第一位就是鄂北，經濟部爲了吸收鄂北的棉花，不知設了多少機構，因此而發財而走運的官商，不知多少人，其實整個鄂北所產的棉花，還不到三十萬担。那末安陽一地就出產三十萬担的棉花，也足驚人了。共軍佔領安陽附近的時候，人尚且在他們　斷統制之下，棉花更不能例外。那時，他們只化五六十元的「抗幣」，向老百姓買一斤棉花，說因此老百姓多牛甘願把棉花爛在地上，賭他們整年辛勞而不得償的一口氣。那些產棉區收復過來後，安陽的棉花突然由二千元一斤跌到一千五百元。</p>
<p>棉商的生意經</p>
<p>現在，一些棉花商潮湧似的到安陽去收購棉花，這是生意經。生意經是一件事，發財又是一件事。照那些棉花商說：到安陽去收購棉花，一定要帶着現鈔去，因爲安陽沒有一家銀行，所以非要有些冒險精神不可；棉花商把棉花當爲生意經，而安陽的地方機關又把棉花商當作生意經，一車價値四千萬元的棉花要出一百萬元以上的額外　派；安陽的一家棉花打包廠僅僅離共軍只有十里路，沒有方法開工，所以一個可載三十噸的車皮，只能裝十六噸的棉花，同時因爲包裝不緊，治途要走漏了百分之二，與必需付十五萬元一車的保險費；過去一萬元的資本，就能收購三十噸的棉花，現在二十萬元只能收購一百六十五斤，那末現在要敢購三十噸的棉花，就得要七千三百多萬元，普通的商人那有這麽大的資金。所以在安陽收購棉花，也是件不容易的生意經。</p>
<p>市面激起熱潮</p>
<p>可是，鄭州的市面，是被棉花激動了。幾家銀行錢莊，大做棉花押匯。由安陽過來的棉花多半運到漢口去，一個棉戶，在鄭州像交通銀行可以申請三萬萬元的押匯，其利息是四分半，但期限只有十五天，到了漢口，還是可以另辦押匯，利息是五分，要是在漢口有廠的話，那期限可以伸展到四十五天，這是優待廠家的關係。　目前經過鄭州的棉花，不過十萬担而已，可是與戰前三百萬祖棉花的過境，還相差太遠。這十萬祖棉花逛過鄭州，已經把鄭州的市面激成熱潮，要是像戰前三百萬担棉花湧流過來，那鄭州就將成爲名符其實的商埠了。『有棉姑娘才有鄭州」，眞是名不虛傳。</p>
<p>中紡公司收棉</p>
<p>中紡公司最近在西北收了三十萬担的棉花，因爲擠不上隴海路的車予，至今還滯留在西安常「難棉」；靈寶一帶的棉花，雖然有人在收購，可是怎樣過來還是問題。棉姑娘的行路難，不僅爲了上不上車，還有因爲沒有替她梳裝打扮的打包娘（打包廠）的關係。原來河南有六個打包娘；在安陽的一個打包娘，已如上述的情形沒有幹了，在靈賽的兩個打包娘，因爲棉姑娘旣經行期不定，也沒有方法替她梳裝打扮；其餘三個打包娘，是在鄭州，兩個被敵人看中了擄了去，還有一個被一個部隊接收去當磨粉婆了，現在正在向國防部請求發還，大概可無間題。</p>
<p>要恢復鄭州的市面，首先要恢復鄭州的棉花市塲，要使它像戰前一樣有三百萬担棉花在鄭州來集數，當然有許多的困難：主要的因爲過去敵人統制棉花，棉田减少不少。這一年多來，自然還不能一下子恢復過來。豫豐，申新紗廠，決定在這裏復廠，但也不是短時間所能完成。廠房要重新蓋起來，機器恐怕還在美國。此外，交通等問題也還多着。。不過大家都在盼望着鄭州恢復到戰前的繁榮，那末就是在盼望着這棉姑娘來到鄭州做市面。</p>

<h3>中電第三部新片「遙遠的愛」</h3>
<p>— 蕭沉</p>
<p>中電二廠自「忠義之家」和「驚飛人間」獻映後，現在又給我們看到了第三部片子「遙遠的愛」。這一部片子的取材是很現實的，片子的主題是：寫一個理想的家庭婦女，在現實的影響下走向社會去。</p>
<p>劇情。蕭元熈敎授因爲在靑年會堂講演遭受到愛人朱曼麗的不滿。而決裂他去，　遂發誓以創造理想的妻子。是晚蕭忽發現女僕阿珍在偷看書。　遂以阿珍爲創造的現象，按日授課，敎以社交之訓練利態度，禮貌。阿珍之學問見識因而蒸蒸日上。「一二八」淞滬戰事爆發，阿珍因父兄遭日寇之慘殺，遂參加看護班，爲受傷抗日戰士服務。某日，珍偶與李練羣同行，爲蕭所賭，大爲不滿。遂囑阿珍不必擔任是項工作，珍對此事頗感失望。至「七七」前夕陽蕭更嚴防珍參加抗日工作，豈知「八一三」戰爭全面爆發，珍爲國事所感動，毅然出外參加工作。適蕭被友人所邀，離滬赴漢。時以國軍西撤，遂電促珍來漢，珍遂以大兒留吳亞男處，自携幼子。隨難民船離滬。不料，中途遇轟炸，幼不慘死。珍遂更堅强抗日之決心，蕭晤珍，見珍已爲軍人，頗感不滿，而珍也厭　蕭之靡爛生活。時適有女兵阿唐來訪，珍逐偕伊同至戰地工作團。蕭聞訊，欲找珍歸，珍不允，乃決裂。武漢撇退，蕭遇吳亞男，知珍已參加李　羣領導之服務團，桂林撤守，蕭步行復遇吳，同赴服務團找珍，蕭懇重溫舊情，珍以勝利後爲答。迨勝利後，珍本擬與蕭重合，乃突兌蕭之錯誤，遂大起辯論，珍遂離蕭而去。蕭仍與朱曼斃結婚，於席間曾稱，珍經改造後，已超過共本人矣。</p>
<p>照故事在大體說來，頗爲緊凑，該片導演陳鯉庭　以理論專家著稱，此次能如意拍攝成功，其成績當可預卜。日前，于「中電」二廠巧遇導演陳鯉庭。知道在該片中的桂林撤退塲面，係於無錫拍攝，僱用臨時演負有一萬餘人，以此塲面而論，當有「錦上添花」之感。</p>
<p>現在，這部片子不久即將在「皇宮」放映，其成績究竟如何，自有輿論批評！</p>

<h3>崑劇盛衰觀</h3>
<p>— 玄廬</p>
<p>崑劇以其產地而得名。但非如川劇楚劇越劇申曲等爲地方劇的一種。同時用以演奏崑劇之崑曲，亦非爲地方音樂。</p>
<p>我國有韻交自詩三百苜一變而爲楚辭，再變而爲漢魏　府，三變而爲唐之今體詩，四變而爲宋詞，詞爲詩之變體，故亦名詩餘。宋詞衍變爲元兀曲，實乃詞之變體，故曲亦名詞餘。所以從吾國文學史看來，曲上承葩經，而下爲近世白話詩文的濫觴。</p>
<p>從戲劇觀點上看，唐代雖有參軍蒼鶻　劇，但其內容如何？已無從考證。詩詞均爲作者發抒個人情感的作品，從無代言之例。至曲則爲代言體，有唱詞，有道白，每一劇本分爲數幕。可以演諸紅　　上，爲大衆所欣賞之一秤藝術作品。所以曲爲吾國最早之戲劇，後世任何一種戲劇，莫不導源干此。</p>
<p>不過元曲曲詞今雖有有者，如臧晋叔之元曲選爲最易購得之本。而其樂調則已失傳。今所傳之崑曲，已非元曲之舊。不過去古較近，雅樂正音，猶存　緒，今述崑曲淵源如决：</p>
<p>繼元而興者爲朱明，明代旣以漢人光復故土，驅除胡元，文藝方面自亦一變元代樸素質直之作風，而崇尙詞藻。然曲之體製，已成根深蒂固之勢，明人雖欲復古，而不能脫離其窠臼。於是曲有南北之分，雜劇謂之北曲，其體製多仿元人遣作，詞句質直不華，音節剛勁多姿，傳奇謂之南曲，高則誠之琵琶記開其先河。初明荆劉拜殺，繼之而作。自中葉以後，代有作者，蔚爲大觀其作風一變元人之實樸直率，而爲綺麗典雅，其昔節則紆徐柔曼，蓋盛世之　也。</p>
<p>惟無論北曲與南曲，若不配合以音樂，不過爲文學上之作品，根本與曲無關，更不能稱馬戲劇。旣曰曲，不僅可以播之管絃，亦且可以演諸紅　　上，斯乃與詩詞不同之所在也。</p>
<p>當明之巾葉，曲在體製上雖分爲南北二派，其樂詞，即在音樂上之一表演方式，因地而異。據徐文長所作南詞叙錄言，有江西之弋陽腔，浙江之海鹽腔，餘姚　，湖北之高　　等等。可知當時曲詞雖一，而其歌方式則各地不同。其混亂情形可想而知。明中葉嘉靖　慶時，江蘇崑山有一位樂曲專家魏良輔者，賭這　　維情形，即深居簡出，窮討古今樂律，以正　爲己任，積十年苦功，發明一種水　腔，著曲律一醫行世。其弟子梁辰魚伯龍著有江東白數曲，及浣紗記傅奇，復　揚而光大之。自水磨腔出，其他各腔均被壓倒，直至淸乾嘉間，稱霸於歌塲舞榭間者，垂三百年之久。在我國音樂史及戰劇史上，爲燦爛光明之鮮葩，蓋水磨腔深究乎劇情之悲歡離合，字音之陰陽四聲，而疾徐抑揚其音節，無一音不具有學理上之根據，以與天　之音相配合，故能流行廣遠如是，當時以此腔出自崑山，故名之曰崑山腔，簡稱崑腔。</p>
<p>由此觀之，崑腔旣能壓倒其他各腔，其流行之廣遠旣如是，當不能視以爲地方音樂。以此音樂演出之崑劇，自亦不能視以爲地方戲劇。而在吾國藝術史上，確具有令國性之價値與地位者矣</p>
<p>惟軍曲在當時何以大盛，至晚近何以式微，此其原故，亦可的略言之：崑曲之所以盛，因有其特點：（一）文字優美，爲士大夫所擊個節稱賞。（二）所配樂音，與曲詞每一個字之本音相配合故字音險陽淸濁四聲不同。樂曲亦隨之而同，世無字字相同之曲詞，故亦絕無節完全相同之樂譜。（三）出字收音，不論在唱詞在賓白均以聲　學爲依據，深得字正腔團之致。（四）表演姿勢，保持唐代舞蹈之遺意，優美嫻雅，象徵中華民族受好和平之意態。</p>
<p>至崑曲之所由盛而衰，以作者體認，大抵不外下列原因：（一）詞采的成份太重，不易爲大衆所欣賞。（二）字音分析太細密，每遇延音太長，聽去反不易辨認。（三）作曲者多係文人學士，長於寫作而短於舞臺經騐，故排傷佈局，往往不能迎合觀眾心理。（四）臺　築與觀眾學　今昔不同，故聲容之　演，昔人所擊節者，往往爲今人所不能聆解。雖然崑劇今雖式微，惟其優點不惟始終存在。且爲其他各種歌劇所取法。而不致淪亡。</p>
<h3>劇本</h3>
<p>— 和定繼</p>
<p>「一曲難忘」是描寫波蘭音樂家蕭邦的一生。這是很難得到最好評價的傳記片因爲熟悉蕭邦一生的人，看了就會知道這一部影片是沒有能眞實地表現出蕭邦的眞正個性。爲了編劇者僅僅取了他一生事蹪中某一部份的輪廓，在故事中，我們翁出了編劇的取材，他並不重視於這故事中的人物，相反地，籍着這一個輸廓表揚了一種情神，使觀衆有所感動。</p>
<p>從蕭邦幼年練琴時，作者僅取了一段故事，來刻劃　蕭邦的靈魂，那就是他和埃爾斯納敎授望到窗外俄羅斯的騎兵隊，他憤怒地擊着琴鍵，表示出他向他們抗議。在成年以後，因爲不願在俄羅斯的「創子手」面前演奏，而潛往巴黎。這正是證明着他的愛國心和他反抗暴虐的精神！</p>
<p>編劇者把蕭邦寫成了一個愛情的俘虜，而喬治桑則被寫成一個妒忌的，膽大的，自私的女人。假若沒有了這一段，那末，蕭邦是不會被觀從們所同情的。</p>
<p>到了蕭邦重見　國的泥土時，他猛地從私情的迷　中驚醒了，再度燃起他對於而國的熱愛。他在各地演奏了「波蘭舞曲」，終因體弱而逝！這一個　國的音樂家蕭邦的精神，將與「波蘭舞曲」垂久不衰。</p>
<p>片中的演員，配得雖然整齊，三個主角除了保羅茂尼之外，其餘的並不如理想巾的美滿，僅是稱職而已，保羅茂尼自始至終比較突出，尤以出版家答應他不日舉行演奏會而喜極　倒的表情。康納雜爾德此「狂　」中爲佳。最好的是：週遊各地演奏，一次决的彈琴，額上的汗珠一次次的多，這一點是最成功的。</p>

<p>看『一曲難忘』的影片，使我也像處身十儿世紀的時代，限見一國人才音樂家在戀愛與責任的矛盾中所演成的悲劇。</p>
<p>這裏有最好的幾個好鏡頭。</p>
<p>蕭邦（幼時）正當練習鋼琴，突見窗外帝俄佔領軍虐待波籣公民的情景，於是　雅的琴聲立變狂擊琴鍵的碰碰聲，導演把他的憤怒的情緒在似萬馬奔騰的亂琴聲中表演出來。</p>
<p>蕭邦在某顯爵家的宴會中演奏娛賓，一曲結束，來賓羣相要求再奏，突沙皇派駐波　　總督篤到，伯爵急趨迎人席，令蕭續奏。　憤怒已極，說：「我不願在沙皇的屠夫前演奏。』遂昂然而出。</p>
<p>蕭因家鄉難以久住，欲逃亡巴黎，臨別，他的抗敵同志兼戀人贈以波蘭泥土一握，願他毋忘祖國。</p>
<p>蕭隨音樂敎師埃爾斯納敎授至巴黎，幸得法浪漫女作家喬治眾及　羣家　斯特的　　，一舉成名，至此，他開始遠　教授，遺忘　國與同志，投人了　治　的懷抱一個寗靜　顧的世界。而　　愛　　深，在　的父母的通迅中，沿諱言一切。某次，教授至桑宅探　蕭邦，　以「我不願在他工作的時候擾亂他』之由，拒絕兩人相見，敎授高呼正在樓上奏琴的蕭邦之名，琴聲勿憂然而止，但不久續起，蕭邦在逸樂與艱苦的矛盾中選擇了前者，敎授　然而返。</p>
<p>波蘭的解放運動受到極度的磨難和挫折，無數的同志遭受逮捕，祇有金錢可加以援救，也祇有蕭邦的藝術可換得大量的金錢，他的舊戀人潛來巴黎，並輾轉贈其彼籣泥土一袋，蕭在苦痛的予盾中，終於掙脫了愛情的束縛、赴歐陸各地演奏，籌款報國，但贏弱之身，終至病到，臨終說：「我好像要回家了。」他的親愛的敎師，戀人，友朋都圍在他的旁邊，除了他切望一會而未如願的喬治桑外。</p>
<p>「情婦的媚惑，良師的督責，左右交攻，祖國的苦難，自身的病痛，內外相煎，結束了音樂大師蕭邦一生可歌可泣的事蹟。」</p>
<h3>「今日中國劇作家」讀後</h3>
<p>— 杜信遠寄自臨準</p>
<p>鑽十月七日納雅的「今日中國的劇作家」一文，有幾點意見：</p>
<p>（一）又內僅運及「今日中國」的四位劇作家，頗學「今日中國的劇作家」不僅此四位，而僅述及此四位作家，似不與２泛的「今日中國的劇作家」之標題切合。作者納雅先生說：「目前諸位所熟悉的幾位劇作者，分別作一介紹與檢討」「諸位所熟悉的」劇作家，似亦不止此四位而已。</p>
<p>（二）對納雅先生的「檢討」似亦不敢荀　，如「……雷雨裏四鳳對她的母親發誓，說往後就給雷打死，結果她是去了，而是被雷打死了，像這種類似提倡迷信的詞白，可以說是他唯一的錯誤的」劇作家用這樣的手法，以加强悲劇氣氛，正是其得當處，似不能斷　取義的硬說是：「很落後的宿命論者，把一個人物排到命運裏去」。關於陳白２的「檢討」，納雅先生又說：「陸言圖專官老爺似　太過火一點，官說什麽，就是什麽，他忘記了百姓的種利」作家用意，正在暴露一般貪官污吏的無能與無恥，當然要强調才能達到作劇之目的，豈能日「過火一點」？</p>
<p>（三）「鳳凰城」是吳祖光的作品，納雅先生把它「介紹」在袁俊的作品裏，袁俊除「小城故事」外，尙有「邊城故事」，都是「城」，「城」來「城」去，容易使人混淆，也許是納雅先生一時記錯了也說不一定。我想，納雅先生絕不會「張冠李戴」的。</p>
<p>上述三點，意雖不雅，未知採納雅先生亦能納否？</p>
<h3>「一曲難忘」與蕭邦一生不符</h3>
<p>— 李文勳</p>
<p>看了「一曲難忘」出來，一位朋友低低的對我說：「溫柔使我流淚……」</p>
<p>蕭邦便是道樣的情形，他底名宇代表着一瓣愛心，在他底沉思的眼裏可以看出一個信者底虔誠，夢想家底哀愁和土地底熱情，他底臨終的聲音不多像鳥之垂死的袁鳴，他呌着基督和聖母底名字，那熱烈的聲音眞可以到達天堂，他用蒼白的嘴唇吻着十字！</p>
<p>「我愛上帝和世人」！多麽眞誠的遺言。他說：「現在我已來到幸福的疆界了」！</p>
<p>鋼琴的詩人，他底樂曲有着悲哀，浪漫，抒情和幻想，他彈琴和他作曲一樣，是舉世無雙的，明珠似的音階，甜密，柔美，淚一般溫柔，淚一般淸澈，他底手顯得很瘦小，‘細的手指和手腕，但一樣可以彈十度的音程，那兩隻手罩住了三分之一的鍵盤，眞是一片奇妙的光景，好像一條迷人的蛇張開了紅嘴要吞下一隻白兎，他底智慧的眼，女性底誘惑的唇，大的　鼻，頭上掛着一個拜倫式的領子，是道樣一位可愛的詩人。可愛的波蘭一人。</p>
<p>蕭邦底心靈的聲音對於我們這個世紀的人仍是重要的，但形式上却顯然被人忽略了，標題音樂將神靈的藝術美到神話裏去了，蕭邦旣不傳敎，又不畫圖，也沒有修身和戲院底形式，這是一種可以聽得見的詩篇，像玫瑰盛放的香味，同魏爾崙，雪萊、濟慈等有着共通之點，但蕭邦總是難以比擬的，他是特殊的，也是一般的，特殊的是他底天才，一般的他是用天才來表達了彼蘭，他底樂曲不但是屬於波蘭，並且說出了波籣人民底悲哀和願望，他以人類之十底尊嚴和熱情來全心全力的擁抱了波蘭。他極端厭惡無聊，卑俗的心靈，他單獨的在他甜密的人間受苦，在他美麗的心靈中感到憂愁……</p>
<p>蕭邦死了，一束如花的聲音熄滅了，至於喬治，桑，她有着男于底剛強，征服慾太强烈，她把男子當作旅館似的居住，她隨時遷移，對蕭邦如此，對繆塞也不例外，據她自已解釋爲「慈母底感情」，以慈母，姆姆，密友，保姆等自居，但她底情慾也如創作一般旺盛，多愁善感的蕭邦是不能滿足她的，她需要一曲强烈的，暴風雨似的樂調。</p>
<p>關於蕭邦，「一曲難忘」底編排是有點失實的！</p>

<h3>新征漫談</h3>
<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>鐵蹄血淚</p>
<p>貞德接受宗敎的犧牲，瓊接受愛情的災難，她們一樣平靜，因爲她們的平靜，瓊在門限上的轉顏一望，向人生投出的最後的吿別，令我們感到少有的悽惶。走上刑塲的人，留一點淚光，晶瑩地閃了半天，被打死了，音樂鐘還在唱歌。</p>
<p>有「貞女恨」一樣的故事，有「諜報敢死團」的Suspense，不要太追究理想，我老早就看厭了反納粹的影片，我會忘記「貞女恨」的導演鮑才琪，可是我忘不了「鐵蹄血淚」的羅勃史蒂文生，「簡孃」是他光榮的里程碑，他照例運用他圓渾的手法，深刻的特寫，攝影的光影，濃厚的氛圍，襯托這一個愛情的故事。他帮助演員演戲，讓他們的情緒在光影裏一明一滅，讓他們强烈的眼睛和發麻的嘴唇說出一生的話語。陣容由是益覺堅强，保羅亨利素來比較康納繼爾德從容，密琪摩根兩頰太闊，側面相甚好，亞倫賴德戲少，不能算數。湯姆斯密契爾，萊特克里格與梅魯特生部是著名配角，輕車熟路，自然稱職。</p>
<p>若是從此爲死亡感到顚抖，我們最好一讀梅森伯夫人的話；「死的觀念應該刺激得我們一心把我們生命導人最高貴的用途，對那組成牠的每一瞬間都賦子最高價値。」這便是貞德和瓊的精神。</p>
<p>鐵窗鴛鴦</p>
<p>世界多麽大，一切人都向外面飛，飛不完的境界，過不完的經歷。「鐵窗鴛鴦」便是說三個向外飛行的人，爲了每一個驛站，他們付予鬥爭，但尼誤投岐途，雖然　然悔悟，但他自有他鬥爭的前路，會回轉來嗎？是的，在飛倦了的時候，他也許會來看一着這一對患難夫妻，可是他絕不滿足這種平常的生活，他不是一個單純的好人，但尼是這個平凡題材中唯一生色的人物，李卻華爾夫把他演活了，他拯救了好友，也拯救了這張片子，於是，安秀麗丹的舞女羅拉和羅納李根的靑年史蒂天才覺得有點可愛，事實上這一對是僅見外形的。</p>
<p>罕見的愛情大悲劇，每一次想到　塲的凄凉，我們模糊地總記起費文應走在滑鐵盧橋上的景像，車聲　憐，她堅忍地走過去，波光水影，兵車的燈，黄色的瞪視的魔眼，制度和命運，人類永遠的堵牆，她的眼睛望穿它，是燭光舞的回憶，歡樂是多麽短促，只一刻，一聲悲呼，羅勃泰勒有我們一樣的記憶了，一次，兩次，久經滄海，依然記得黑夜裏的滑鐵盧橋，那麽深湛，那麽慘痛，茂文李洛埃有此一部片子已足自傲了。</p>

<h3>自由魂</h3>
<p>— 吳漱予</p>
<p>根據報紙公佈的審訊漢奸的筆錄，差不多千個一律地可以求得這麽一個公式，那就是每一個漢奸在審訊的時候，必然要辯明他那不得已而做漢奸的動機和經過，在這不得已的叙述裏，他是多方煊染他的動　是於抗戰有利，而經過則在掩護抗戰陣營中的地下工作；有時候，那狡黠善變的漢奸們，明知道他那些鬼扯談不能慫動檢察官們的視聽，就腦筋轉動來一段插曲稅是『常初本來打算自殺的，可是後來……沒有能够成爲事實，這也許是一個錯誤』云云。說這些鬼話的漢奸們，究竟有那幾個，手頭沒有剪報，無法列舉；但憑腦子的記憶，極司非而路「七十六號」的偽特工頭子丁逆默邨，就是這其中的一個。</p>
<p>後來——不，也許是在審訊丁逆默邨的前幾天，高檢處曾經一度傳訊附逆影人，可惜的是那一次的傳訊，結果弄成病的病，逃的逃，不能讓我們在報紙上讀到他們的口供筆錄。現在，根據報紙的記載，高檢處又在準備傳訊第×批附逆影人，覆轍難再，這回的高檢處，是不是防範未然不讓他們病，也不准他們逃，雖不得而知；但，作爲影迷之一的我，却很希望不致落空而能够在報紙上讀到他們的口供筆錄，並且也願意作一次義務校對，看看這批附逆影人的供詞和偽特工頭子丁逆默邨的供詞，到底有多少不同？原因是後者在行爲上是爲敵偽張目摧殘了我們的愛國志士，而前者則在思想上，仰承敵人的鼻息在麻醉軟化我們的愛國志士和我們的下一代。</p>
<p>假如這一次的義務校對，發覺他們的供詞相同，並且也有那麽一段插曲，那到眞是「難兄難弟」，不謀而合；假如又因爲道一批附逆影人是藝術家，連說帶做，來個當庭表演，則故事現成，編導現成，演員現成，大可以拍攝一部影片而命名曰『自由魂』。導演呢？是聯合導演，演員呢？是全體演員，那準會有聲有色，而『銀海千秋』，必定要『萬世流芳』了。</p>
<p>寫到這兒，要稅的話，已經說完；但拿起稿紙，從頭讀過一遍，又發覺原來還少了一個製片老闆，這個不大不小的問題，可眞有點兒麻煩，怎麽辦呢？祇好慢慢找吧，　實在找不着，偽華影的　事，就有褚逆民誼和周逆佛海，兩者擇一，何如。假如是擇中褚逆民誼，那身居　國的『天字第一號』大漢奸如在逆兆銘陳逆公博之流聞之，一定會大聲笑着；『中華冥國電影聯合股份有限公司已經組織成立了，我們馬上就可以看到嶄新國產影片』。</p>

<h3>人類恩人巴斯德</h3>
<p>— 徐仲年</p>
<p>逝世五十周年祭</p>
<p>路易·巴斯德（Louis　Psateur：一八二二—一八九五）是近代法國的大生物學家，發現微菌，引起醫藥界的大革命，浩福人類匪淺。他的硏究集中於結晶作川，發酵，　病，犬瘋，家畜傳染病，以及人類傳染病。他是法蘭西學院（Academie　Francaies）和法國科學學院（Acadmie　des　Sciences）的會員。一八八六，國際人士捐款在巴黎建設巴斯德硏究院（Institut　Prsteur），以微　學，血淸治療學，生物化學爲硏究中心。繼而法國北部里兒（Lille），以及世界各文化中心，都設立巴斯德硏究院；——中國的巴斯德研究院設在上海　正南二路（　名金神父路）二〇七號。</p>
<p>今年恰是巴斯德逝世五十週年。上海的巴斯德硏究院定於十二月十五日，星期日，上午九時，在該院舉行紀念儀式，特請專家演講：「巴氏發明對於純粹生物及日用科學之進展。」</p>
<p>旣然有專家演講，不勞筆者畫蛇添足。我所要介紹的乃是這位　滿世界的學浙的謙遜和純孝。一八八二年七月十四日（注意：七月十四日是法國的國慶節），巴斯德故鄉杜兒（Doie）的市參議會，當了巴斯德本人，在他誕生的房子牆上按置一方紀念牌。　方致詞之後，巴斯德有一片答詞：現今我把這片答詞繙　於後，用資紀念。</p>
<p>諸位先生：</p>
<p>今天社兒城給我很大的榮譽，我深深的感激；不過，對於這個過度的光榮，請諸位准允我提出抗議。這種敬意，只宜於有名望的死者們，却蒙錯愛，居然惠及下走，可是您們　越後代人的批評實在太快了！</p>
<p>您們的議決案將要改正麽？市長先生，您應該不應該先謹愼地通知市參議會，不要採取這個太草率的方案？</p>
<p>但是，先生們，我抗議過了這個表面太招謠的崇拜，——我是萬萬不敢當的，——請諸位讓我表白二我感動非常，直到魂靈深處。在這塊紀念牌上您們的同情凝合了我生平我最愛，最感興奮的兩件事物：對於科學的愛好和對於家庭的眷戀。</p>
<p>哦！我的父親和我的母親！哦！我的親愛的亡者！你們曾經在這座小屋裏這般拮据地生活着，我的一切正是你們的賜予！我的勇敢的母親啊，妳把妳的熱忱　傳給我了。如果我永遠拿科學的偉大配合着祖國的偉大，那因爲我滿懷是妳所啓發我的觀念而你呢，我的親愛的父親，你的生活像你的職業同樣的艱難，你曾經昭示我：有恒的努力能够獲得什麽樣的結果。正是由於你，我纔懂得在日常工作裏固執不休·你不但　備使生命化爲有用的毅力，你還崇拜偉大的人物和偉大的事業。高視　囑，水還努力向上：此乃你所敎導我的。我回憶起，每天工作完畢，你總　覽常代歷史，它使你想起你所　覩的光榮時代。當你敎我　　的時候，你從未忘掉敎我認識法蘭西的偉大。</p>
<p>祝福你們，我的敬愛的雙親，爲了你們平素的言行，讓我把今天向這座房子所表示的敬意率　給你們。</p>
<p>先生們，我謝　諸位允許我，將我六十年來心中所想的坦白陳述。我謝謝諸位這個慶祝會和諸位的招待，我　謝杜兒巿，它監視着它的每一個孩子，而對於我懷有這樣的紀念！</p>

<h3>某廠主</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>昨天在席間遇到某工廠主人，他向大家叙述他創業的經遏，其中有幾句話意味深長，足予人以啓示，我很受感動，願在這里轉吿我的讀者。</p>
<p>他說：我的事業，沒有一年不遭受到打擊，這十年來，假使沒有這些打學，事業的發展情形，一定無可佔　。可是再想一想，任何一種事業總得受打擊，國家尙　遭到患難哩！假使無挫折，事業本身的價值也頗成問題了。失敗中才可以出現勇敢。應該面對困難。普通做生意的人，第一種祗管賺錢不顧其它，第二種賺了錢便賣田置產，返　納福，把他在事業中所獲得的經騐，全部浪費了，這兩種人都不是我們工商界所應有的。</p>
<p>他又說：不景氣的侵襲，整個工商界都普遍遭受到的，困難大家都有，但不必杯弓蛇影過事驚慌，因爲你一怕，會影響別人，別人也怕，大家都怕，都不動手，那不是死路一條嗎？</p>
<p>我不必說明這是哪一家工廠，主人姓甚名誰，但十五年前他以七千元的資本經營這一事業，如今已成爲國內此榮中首屈一指的廠家了，他有魄力，有眼光，肯犧牲，不畏難，求進步，不欺騙，凡此，都是他成功的因素。</p>
<p>腐　的讓它死去罷，在工商界不景氣聲中，眞正的事業家是不會跌倒的，這個信念也許一般人還未能認識罷。</p>

<h3>霸王別姬</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>陣容：堅強有如下列：</p>
<p>楚霸王—某工廠老闆，一個本地的實業家飾。</p>
<p>虞姬——老闆的姨太太飾</p>
<p>范增——工廠賬房先生（不出場）</p>
<p>探子——工廠小夥計飾</p>
<p>韓信——小白臉（不出場）</p>
<p>鼕鼕鏘鏘，鑼鼓開塲。</p>
<p>楚霸王：想起了當年事，好不傷心。昔日我是好下威風啊！我是無戰不勝，無往不利，昨天物價漲一倍，今天便漲十倍，明天即將漲百倍。不斷地上漲，數目中的「〇」，也一個一個被我俘虜了來增加我的財產數目。旣發了國難財，又發了勝利財，更發了美金財。可是現在，張眼一看，債台高築，已被圍困住……</p>
<p>（四面楚歌之聲，喧鬧得很厲害。）</p>
<p>楚霸王：探子，快去打聽，是否攤販羣集而來，快快當心玻璃窗！</p>
<p>（探子去而復來。）</p>
<p>探子：回報大王，人心向外，四面楚歌乃是一片呼喊着爭買外國貨之聲，以及討債之聲！</p>
<p>楚霸王！唉—氣死我也。那麽，我的國貨出品怎麽辦呀！快召范增來，設法應付的對策。</p>
<p>探子：回報大王，范增已不別而行，離開了此地，去吃洋行飯了。</p>
<p>楚霸王：呀……呀……呸，氣……氣死我也！老賊種，竟然這樣的沒有愛國心！</p>
<p>探子：回報大王，你不能怪他，你付不出他的薪水，洋行裏卻有美金票可以賺，范增當然要捨此就彼了。</p>
<p>楚霸王：吹，天喪予，天喪予！顧客爭購外國貨，職員去吃洋行飯！吹，木工廠老闆，本大王……唉，一言難盡！</p>
<p>探子：回報大王，范增雖然去吃洋行飯，據說，「洋肉」沒有吃着，惹了一身「洋騷」，今已騷發背死在途中了！</p>
<p>楚霸王：對啊！歷史上似乎的確是這樣的寫着，范增，這苦老頭子，也是他命該如此，活該！來啊，去請虞姬娘娘！</p>
<p>（探子下，虞姬上）</p>
<p>處姬：（未上塲前一段唱工。唱的什麽，你不會聽得懂的所以只得删去了。）虞姬向大王請安。問大王召我來，有何吩咐？</p>
<p>楚霸王：俺家的心中　煩悶，召卿來，別無他事，想請愛卿舞一會劍讓我散散心。</p>
<p>虞姬：老而不死，你老昏了嗎？現在原子炸彈時代，還要舞劍嗎？</p>
<p>楚霸王：賤東西，你竟罵起我來了。什麽話！你預備怎樣？</p>
<p>虞姬：你已經欠了一屁股的債，單是利息你就還不出，跟你還有什麽趣味？明天我決定捲逃了。</p>
<p>楚霸王：唉，氣死我也。（說着他就唱起「力拔山兮氣蓋世」的歌詞來了。）</p>
<p>「物價漲兮愁蓋世，</p>
<p>時不利兮洋貨巿，</p>
<p>利息兩角可奈何，</p>
<p>老婆跟人奈若何！」</p>
<p>滾吧，隨你的便：啊，且慢。你要跟的是誰？</p>
<p>虞姬：小白臉韓信。</p>
<p>楚霸王：好傢伙！我還以爲你跟了外國水手哈囉喬呢！十個小白臉倒有九個靠不住，你怎麽知道韓信一定要你呢？</p>
<p>虞姬：不信你可以去問，假使他不要我，我情願在你面前自殺。</p>
<p>楚霸王拉起電話，一撥號碼：喂，劉邦事務所嗎？呌韓信聽電話，喂，韓信，你引誘我家主婆，是不是？什麽？你不要她……</p>
<p>虞姬過去，搶着電話說：喂，親愛的，你……什麽？……你……唉，你這狼心狗肺的東西。（說着把電話掛斷了。）</p>
<p>楚霸王：不聽老夫言，吃苦在眼前，根據劇情，你是應該在舞劍時自刎的。你說這是原子炸彈時代而不肯舞劍，難道你預備用原子炸彈自殺嗎？啊，那未免太闊綽，太出風頭了。</p>
<p>盧姬默不作答，在袋拿出一瓶DDT，連喝三口，於是，她就嗚呼哀哉，伏維尙饗！（她也就回到後台去休息了。）</p>
<p>楚霸王再出陣應戰，沒有幾個回合，就敗退下來，被債主們逼到了烏江路口，那裏，遇到了江東父老——一羣「野鷄律師」</p>
<p>江東父老：大王，你也不必去和那些債主們爭鬥。事已如此，不如早作退計。到我這裏來，宣吿破產，實行淸理！等到第三次世界大戰爆發，你就可以重整旗鼓，再發國難財！</p>
<p>楚霸王：承蒙好意，不勝感激。算了罷！我堂堂七尺大丈夫，不做那些婆婆媽媽的事。啊，打開天窗說亮話，一筆訴訟費，廣吿費，淸理費等等你的律師費也相當唬得壞人呢。老實說，老子付不出，僅留空頭支票一本，以此奉謝故人，聊表薄意，根據歷史和劇情，在此烏江路口，我項羽理應拔劍自刎。然而虞姬說的對，這是原子時代，再做這一類的玩意，似乎太壽頭壽腦了。看，遙遠地，吉普車已駛過來了。牡丹花下死，作鬼也風流，吉普車下死，該是作鬼也摩登耳！謹祝我楚霸王流芳百世罷！（幕閉！劇完！）</p>
<h3>西服店員的話</h3>
<p>— 碩石</p>
<p>昨天在一個偶然的塲合中，遇到了一位業西服店的老鄰居。我們是感到意外的和睦，眞有「酒逢知己千杯少」的樣子；從他的言語中，暗示了我許多西服業的內幕。</p>
<p>不但是他，就是我，終感到非常奇怪，爲什麽中國人要盲目地崇拜「外國貨」？尤其是在上海更可普遍的看到。譬如就以現在的西服業來說，放在橱窗裏的衣料，其實大多數是中國製造的，但是西服業的老闆都把它改了外國名稱，而變成了外國貨利用一般顧客肓目崇拜「終是外國貨好」的心理，果然顧客盈門；如果不是這樣，生意就要淸淡了！</p>
<p>還有，譬如有一疋麥爾登呢，西服店的老闆把它剪爲二段，一段說是中國製造的，另一段說是外國來路貨。（其實仍是一疋裏的），常顧客來時，他們就佯稱這段是「中國貨」。那段是「外國貨」，讓顧客們去選擇，而竟會有顧客稱贊外國貨確比中國貨好，眞長究哉枉也！這裏所謂「中國貨」「外國貨」，還不是一疋布裏剪下來的嗎？</p>
<h3>此時此地</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>集團告地狀</p>
<p>上海人喜新鮮，祇要舉動出奇，定可制勝，做買賣是如此，求乞也不例外。</p>
<p>昨午走過金陵東路，見五六人並排跪在地上，面前用粉筆寫了幾行乞憐文字，原來都是吿地狀的。</p>
<p>集團吿地狀，名詞够新鮮，也祗有上海才有。但也顯示出這一「年關」的嚴重性。</p>
<p>美容照相館</p>
<p>林森中路有一家照相館，拍出來的相片，平均要比本人本來面目美麗幾分，往往在取照片時，總要經過一兩分鐘，方才把自己認出來。稱之爲美容照相館，可謂名實組符。</p>
<p>可惜那一家照相館，冲印取照，常常誤期逾限，未免美中不足。並且，有一點應該特別提醒讀者，凡是那一家照相館的照片，選丈夫，擇女友，不足爲憑，最低限度，應打七折八扣。</p>
<p>杞人之憂</p>
<p>袋裏有鈔，想起要買圍巾禦寒，走到第一家商店，看中了一條，問價索三萬二；再行入第二家，見有同樣貨物，標價祗售兩萬八千，雖然便宜了些，還是捨不得買。最後，在一個攤販手中，以二萬元換得原先一般羊毛圍巾。</p>
<p>事後想想，心裏一則以喜，一則以懼，喜的是買到了便宜貨，怕的是，年關之前，上海會不會發生和上决情形相彷的「商店老闆搗毀攤販」？</p>

<p>— 黄嘉謨</p>
<p>拾荒·牽羊·走僵屍</p>
<p>在本地丐帮中、有能力的弟兄們，莫不努力奪鬥，其找錢的路綫，已如上述各節。但帮中一輩老弱丐流，爲了體力虧損，有的染有姻癖，吃不起鴉片而改喫白麵。此輩懶惰成性，鶉衣百結，旣不能如同帮弟兄輩之「勤謹力作」，又不債任重負遠，出賣勞力。於是祇得單人匹馬，在不規定的時間內，自己活動。這在帮中算是最徵末的丐流，不但給路人所看不起，同帮弟兄也都羞與爲伍。</p>
<p>「淘金掃珠」是多麽美麗的名詞啊。原來是拾荒的切口，眞虧他們想得出，此輩每日背了空籃出外拾荒，名爲「背百賓箱」，生活倒也自由自在，不受任何的拘束。拾荒的目的地是各里弄的垃圾箱，以及住宅地段的垃圾堆積處。他們雖是末等生意，可是收入可觀。因爲土海的公館住家，大都習於奢侈生活、常常暴殄天物，雜用物隨意拋棄。丐流都是廢物利用法的實行家。在他們眼中看來，這許多垃圾當中儘有金錢在內。他們曉得如何「淘金掃珠」，不管是舊玻璃瓶舊盒罐，破銅爛鐵，竹塊木頭，樣樣都値得檢收，然後轉賣給荒貨的專賣店。在戰前，平均每日可有一元的收入。</p>
<p>在敵偽時代，物資缺乏，仟何破玻璃片，碎紙，炳布，都可以作爲製紙或其他的原料。此輩丐流居然頗有盈餘，到了戰後，美軍到滬，大量美貨物資源源而來，居民得新棄舊，時常把過去所珍惜的舊具物都拋棄了，又平添了丐流不少値錢的舊貨。尤其是在美軍兵營附近，時常可以拾得大宗的空罐頭，舊木籍，以及嶄新的舊布袋之流。在聯總各貨棧附近，委棄的雜物極其可觀，那已經不是「淘金掃珠」，而是「照單全收」。因爲都是值錢的東西，怪不得拾荒者紛紛鑚求鵠侯，惟恐失之交臂呢！</p>
<p>「順手牽羊」簡稱「牽羊」，乃是借拾荒的護符而兼辦偷竊者。他們的計畫很狡黠周密，不易破案。其目的物不出放置在里弄巾住戶後門的輕重雜物，乘人不備時，見到便偷。立刻納入荒貨的箱簍中，而後再把不潔的紙布垃圾，遮蓋其上，誰也不疑心他們行竊，誰也不願意在他們的汚穢的　簍中，施行檢查。因此他們反可以藉拾荒的姻幕，自由出人里弄，就地取材，適可而止。其所得的雖是些不甚値錢的東西，但日積月累，變賣起來也頗有餘潤。例如「鮮荷葉」—（是浸在水桶中尙未洗凈的衣服，乘女僕走開時下手略取幾件的）。「飄白紙」—（已晒掛的衣服）。「月亮」—（各種大小木盆）。「呆烏　」—（大小椅凳）。「鳥　頭」—（木馬桶），以及其他零星　物料。</p>
<p>還有一種「　猪耳朶」的怪行業，却是偷竊而兼敲詐者，業此者，須有二人爲搭擋。「猪耳朶」乃是馬桶蓋，他們先由一人在大淸早入里弄的拾荒，大偷馬桶蓋。這時一般人尙高歌未起，家家戶戶的後門口却都有幾隻馬桶安放着。因爲此時馬桶事已來過，女僕們正忙於州廚房執役，馬桶成已洗凈或未洗淨。於是此輩便乘間「摘猪耳朶」幾隻，納入簍內溜之大吉，女僕發覺了立即聲張。於是同帮一人便走來問訊，說是偷竊人已見到，須多少錢即可取贖，其價每隻一二元不等。住宅雖明知其係連黨，但惟求贖回了事。不欲爲此區區而鬧出官司來。本來一隻馬桶蓋所値無幾，偷得後轉賣更不値錢。但住戶因爲馬桶不能一日不用，更不可一日無馬桶蓋。馬桶有大有小，專配一隻馬桶蓋也絕無買處，而又絕無其他的東西可以代替。結果整個馬桶等於廢物。丐流深明此中委曲，居然以偷馬桶蓋爲詐錢的法門，眞是惡作劇之至！</p>
<p>「走僵屍」是被僱　負商店招牌，流動的走遍街頭巷尾，或身穿奇異的衣帽，滿書廣告文字，權代商店作活動廣告。個人稱之爲「走僵屍」。此一行業，在民初期即已見到。但因其惡俗不登大雅，邇來差不多已絕跡了。</p>
<p>星期雜談</p>
<h3>婆媳之間（上）</h3>
<p>— 集體意見</p>
<p>于今更烈的家庭問題</p>
<p>（編者按：這次雜談，來稿最多。本刋僅就來稿巾選擇不同的意見，披露如下，並因積稿過多，下期將此問題重複一次，如有新的意見，仍極歡迎。）</p>
<p>兒子有責</p>
<p>我以爲婆媳失和，兒子應負大部責任；因爲這類家庭糾紛，十九由於他的不能均勻劃分母子與夫締間的愛與義務所促成。（錢昌年）</p>
<p>生理因素</p>
<p>婆媳不和，除了利害關係外，尙有生理上原因。婆媳兩人，雖同屬女性，而性情行動，亦常處於相反地位。婆媳年齡，至少相差念餘齡，在生理上，女子廿四齡左右時，血氣旺，行動亦活潑，對一切刺激，易起反應；若至四十五齡左右，則月經開始停閉，斷經期之婦女，感情易致變化，性情乖張，極易惱怒，適應環境之能力很鈍弱，職是之故，婆媳倆在性情方面，一沉着而固執，一活潑而好動，再加上利害關係，當然無法調和！（氳　）</p>
<p>兩種愛的衝突</p>
<p>澈底地說，婆媳之間是注定了無法協調的。這是夫妻愛與母子愛的衝突，兩種不同利益的對立，沒有東西可以使她倆之間密合起來，即使是表面和睦，也不過是她倆之間度量較寬，修養較深的結果，決非這對婆媳眞的絕無裂痕，母子愛與夫妻愛可能平衡，但一旦發生事故，母子愛往往敵不過夫妻愛的！理由很簡單：夫妻愛，在利害上，兩者終身利益一致，在生理上，年齡相仿，「性愛」交流。故只要夫妻間眞的感情極好，則爲兒子的，總難免稍偏袒於妻子。。坦白地說，這是事實所使然，也是人類固有的自私心所使然！因此，婆婆總是妬忌着媳婦。</p>
<p>所以，婆媳分居，是治本之法。其他不澈底方法，都只是可暫而不可久的。（索貝）</p>
<p>「娶媳婦」</p>
<p>明明是兒子結婚，却要稱×太太「娶媳婦」，從這句話裏即可顯示婆太太的尊嚴；也注定了婆息間的關係。（娥）</p>
<p>爲婆婆進一言</p>
<p>聰明的婆婆，我要勸吿你一聲，但請你相信我的眞誠而不要動氣，現在的時代和你做媳婦的時代是大大的不同了，社會意識的不同和敎育文化的進步，已把你和你的媳婦劃分在兩個不同的區域裏。我想，你在做媳婦的當兒，也曾在背地裏怨恨你那嚴厲，細心，善於吹毛求疵的婆婆。但那時限於社會觀念的固舊和封建思想的束縛，使你要恨也只得恨在心裏，背地裏灑出了眼淤，表面上還得陪着笑臉。其實，你那時又何嘗不想避開婆婆的過嚴的管束，去過自由幸福的日子呢？因此，現在你就原諒你媳婦一些吧，現在的人眞不能再和從前的人比了呢，不要再說那種「娶了媳婦賣了兒子」的氣話了！年靑人誰不愛玩玩，跳跳，自由自在地過她們的小家庭生活呵！你就放開些吧，又何苦去做她們的惡人呢？你儘可百事不問，安安穩穩地亨着　福，做一個親熱的婆婆吧！（鳳）</p>
<p>三點意見</p>
<p>（一）自己的女兒，即是人案將來的媳婦；自己的娘婦、即是人家從前的女兒；而婆婆的地位，也都由媳婦遞升到　婆媳雖非母女，但都是「女兒」出身，都　過「母女之愛」的滋味，假使婆婆能够把着待女兒的心腸對媳婦，媳婦能够把着待母親的心腸對婆婆；那末，無論什麽成見，都可以化爲和諧融洽的了！</p>
<p>（二）如果能够自立的話，做媳婦的最好跟丈夫組織小家庭，小家居一處，使婆媳間會少離多，則相逢之日，自會前愆盡釋，和好愈恒！</p>
<p>（三）如果沒有自立的能力，那末做媳婦的即使有滿心委屈，也只好忍受一時了！惟「己所不欲，不施於人」，他年自己做了婆婆，切莫把以往所受的委屈，發泄在媳婦身上；否則，說句笑話：「冤冤相報」，婆媳間的情感，便永成「定案」了！（羊仁）</p>

<h3>Comprehensive Committee Holds Meeting, First Article of Draft Constitution Revised Again, Decision on National Capital Issue Postponed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The first, second, and seventh of the National Assembly's draft constitution review committees have completed their reviews today. At this point, the work of the first through eighth review committees has concluded. The ninth comprehensive review committee held its first meeting this afternoon. It will continue on the 15th, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Comprehensive Review Committee of the Draft Constitution held a meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Over 130 people attended. The conveners were Sun Ke, Chen Cheng, Chen Qitian, Xu Qilin, Kong Geng, Bai Yunti, Xi Wangshu, Wang Shijie, and He Hong, among others, totaling nine people. Today, Sun Ke served as the chairman. Initially, someone raised the issue of the Comprehensive Review Committee's powers, questioning whether there had been any changes to its authority over the review results of each group. The chairman explained the committee's powers as follows: (1) Issues involving two or more review committees with interconnected relationships would be studied and resolved by this committee. (2) Unresolved issues debated by various review committees. (3) Significant changes to the principles of the draft constitution. (4) Compiling the results of each review committee and organizing the text before submitting it to the National Assembly for discussion. After discussion, it was decided that the original review results of each group and the review results of the Comprehensive Review Committee could be submitted to the National Assembly simultaneously. Following the items decided at the conveners' meeting on the 13th, discussions began on:</p>
<p>(1) The Issue of the Form of Government: The chairman reported that, during the conveners' meeting, representatives from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party expressed dissent regarding the First Review Committee's revisions. To respect the opinions of all parties, the Comprehensive Committee further discussed and decided to change it to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People." The discussion involved some debate, but it proceeded in an atmosphere of amicable consultation. The Democratic Socialist Party representative argued that "Three Principles of the People" should be placed in the preamble, and this article should be changed to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic." One representative believed that this article was biased towards the Kuomintang, and the words "Three Principles of the People" should not be fixed in the text. Subsequently, another representative stated that the Three Principles of the People are no longer exclusive to the Kuomintang. For example, the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction and the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction were participated in by various parties and factions, and it was decided to establish the Three Principles of the People as the foundation for national construction. The original article contained the words "Three Principles of the People" and was also agreed upon by various parties. Finally, representative of the social elites, Fu Sinian, spoke, advocating for the removal of the words "of the people, by the people, for the people" from the results of the First Review Committee. Yu Jiaju and many other representatives of the Youth Party immediately expressed their approval, and it was immediately passed. (2) The Issue of the National Capital was postponed for discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding the Powers of the National Assembly - Submitted to the National Assembly for Reconsideration</p>
<p>(3) A. The issue of the National Assembly was decided by the Eleventh Review Committee to add an article at the beginning of Chapter Three: "The National Assembly is the highest organ representing the people of the Republic of China in exercising political power." At the conveners' meeting, the Democratic Socialist Party raised objections. After consultation, it was changed to "The National Assembly exercises political power on behalf of the national people in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution." Many people felt that the words "highest organ" were inappropriate, and the discussion was very heated. As a result, both opinions were submitted to the National Assembly. B. The Second Review Committee amended Article 26 to "Each county or city and its equivalent areas shall elect one representative. However, for every 300,000 people exceeding 300,000, one additional representative shall be elected. Equivalent areas of counties and cities shall be determined by law. The number of representatives elected from the Mongol banners and Tibet shall be determined by law. The number of representatives elected from overseas Chinese nationals shall be determined by law. The number of representatives elected from professional organizations shall be determined by law. The number of representatives elected from women's organizations shall be determined by law." During the Comprehensive Committee's discussion, someone raised the issue of ethnic minorities, suggesting that special provisions should be made for Xinjiang. The meeting adjourned due to the late hour and was scheduled to continue on the 15th, both morning and afternoon, with the hope of completing the discussion on the 15th so that the National Assembly could be held on the 16th. If this is not possible, the National Assembly may be postponed by one day.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Responsible for Supervising and Promoting the Implementation of the Constitution, Second Review Committee Passes Addition of Article 152</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Second Review Committee held its final meeting this morning, chaired by Li Bin. First, Article "149", which had already been passed yesterday, was put up for discussion again. Deng Gongxuan and others spoke, believing that the National Assembly should have the power to interpret the constitution. They advocated adding it to the article and stipulating the number of representatives from the Legislative, Supervisory, and Judicial Yuan participating. The interpretation of the amended and passed constitution was that the National Assembly would mutually elect fifteen people, and the Legislative, Supervisory, and Judicial Yuan would each nominate five people to form a Constitutional Interpretation Committee, with the President of the Judicial Yuan as the chairman. Subsequently, Articles "150" and "151" were heatedly discussed and continued to be amended. Zhu Huiqing and others suggested adding Article 152 after Article "151" and passed the text of the article as "The National Assembly that formulates the Constitution is responsible for supervising and promoting the implementation of the Constitution. The term of office of its representatives shall terminate on the day the National Assembly produced in accordance with this Constitution convenes." This article concerns the term of office of the representatives. Zhu and others repeatedly spoke on it. Finally, Dai Tianqiu and others proposed a temporary motion that the National Assembly that formulates the Constitution should establish a committee to supervise the implementation of constitutional governance during its session, and the specific measures would be determined separately. The meeting adjourned in the afternoon. At this point, the Second Review Committee's review of the chapters on "National Assembly" and "Implementation and Interpretation of the Constitution" was completed.</p>
<h3>Seventh Review Committee Completes Review Work</h3>
<p>Four Subgroups Pass Resolutions with Amendments</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Seventh Review Committee continued its meeting this morning, chaired by Lou Tongsun, and discussed the resolutions made by the four subgroups. Articles "133" to "137", concerning national defense and foreign affairs, were all passed according to the review results of the first subgroup. Article "138" was passed. Items one and two of Article "139" were passed. The third item was changed to "Land prices, excluding those increased by the application of labor and capital, shall be subject to a land value increment tax, which shall be shared by the people," in order to avoid unclear wording and being mistaken for land confiscation. The fourth item was amended to "The state's allocation and organization of land shall be based on the principle of supporting self-cultivating farmers and those who use the land themselves, and stipulating appropriate operating areas." Regarding the public operation of public utilities in "Article 140", Zhu Jiahua advocated adding postal services, telecommunications, and railways, all to be state-owned. Fu Sinian supplemented by adding the words "aviation". A heated discussion ensued. In the end, the majority believed that public utilities were already included, and Zhu and Fu's proposal was rejected. Zhu and others requested the right to raise it again in the National Assembly. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM in the morning and continued in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Seventh Review Committee continued its meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Because many representatives went to see a play, only 84 people attended. Xie Chengping, the chairman, reported that each group had finished their work, but this group was behind and hoped to complete the work on that day. The discussion then proceeded "at full speed". Article "141" was passed without objection. Article "142" was moved to the end. Article "143" of the social security section was passed. Articles "144", "145", "147", and clauses 2, 3, and 4 of Article "146" were, due to the issue of central and local authority, passed according to Xiao Zheng's proposal and transferred to the Comprehensive Review Committee to be merged into the chapter on "Authority of the Central and Local Governments". As proposed by Zhu Jiahua, the first item of Article "146", which was reserved, was amended to "All goods within the territory of the Republic of China shall be allowed to circulate freely. (The following eight words are deleted: 'Unless prohibited by law.')" As for Article "148", the issue of financial institutions sparked debate. Zhao Longwen advocated for state-owned banks to prevent private banks from only knowing how to stir up trouble, engage in speculation for profit, and disrupt the distorted phenomenon of finance. Yu Yinsheng believed that, based on the current measures of state-owned banks, state-owned banks alone would not be enough to solve the problem. Zhao replied that if banks could thoroughly improve their business policies and strategies, state-owned banks would definitely be able to develop stable strength. Li Wenzhai declared that the original motivation for this article was to provide relief to the unemployed during the agricultural off-season and should not shift the focus to financial institutions, striving for the interests of the common people. At this point, Xiao Zheng put forward a compromise, believing that the problems with private banks were indeed significant, but uniformly changing them to state-owned also had practical difficulties. He suggested strengthening the management of private banks and promoting small-scale industrial and commercial loans to resolve the dispute. As a result, the article was amended to "The state should widely establish financial institutions for the common people to provide relief to the unemployed." (Originally "Promote full employment," adding thirteen words below: Financial institutions should be managed by the state in accordance with the law. Article "149" was amended to "The state should assist (adding three words) and protect the development of the economic (deleted three words) undertakings of overseas Chinese nationals." As for the proposals concerning labor and capital and currency that were not passed in the subgroup, it was resolved to transfer them to the Comprehensive Review Committee. The review of the national economy section was thus concluded. After a break, the meeting was chaired by Lai Lian to begin discussing the review results of the third education and culture subgroup. In the first article, the words "democratic spirit" in "Article 143 of the original draft" were amended to "spirit of autonomy." The five articles from two to six were all passed without objection. Article seven sparked a heated discussion on education funding. Some advocated not stipulating the proportion of central education funding reduced in the total budget. Some advocated limiting the proportion of education funding for governments at all levels in the total budget to the total current budget, but in the end, it was still passed according to the original proposal. Article eight, regarding the state's protection of the livelihoods of education, science, and art workers, also sparked debate. Cheng Xiaogang and Xiao Zheng believed that there was already universal protection in the social security section and advocated for the abolition of this article. Ding Zhongying then proposed adding the words "medical care", but in the end, those who maintained the original proposal won by a margin of two votes over those who advocated for its abolition. Article nine was passed without objection. Article ten, regarding rewards or subsidies for education, was also passed after debate. The review of the education and culture section was thus concluded. By this time, it was already 8:00 PM, and after extending the meeting, the review results of the fourth social security subgroup, six articles in total, were discussed and passed without objection. Chairman Lai reported that the work of organizing the text and arranging the article numbers for the review was the responsibility of the conveners. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 PM, and the preliminary review of the entire draft constitution was thus completed.</p>
<h3>Long-Distance Telephone Charges for Journalism Circles in Nanjing and Shanghai to be Calculated at 70% Discount Starting Today</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] According to the Nanjing Telegraph Bureau, starting from the 15th, from 9:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next morning, long-distance telephone charges for journalism circles will be calculated at a 70% discount.</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Facilities are Complete, Should Request Constitutional Rule be Implemented First, Representatives from Taiwan to the National Assembly Express Reasons to Reporters</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] All eighteen representatives from Taiwan to the National Assembly, including Huang Guoshu, hosted reporters at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Huang, Li Wanjyu, Xie E, and others reported separately on the suggestions they had made to the National Assembly. They planned to request that the province be designated as a constitutional experiment province and that the constitution be implemented first in the province after it is promulgated. The reasons are that the province has completed population surveys and land surveys, and the security guards and roads are complete. People’s education is widespread, so constitutional rule should be implemented first. They also asked the government to clearly protect the national status of Taiwanese people and commend the loyalty of the province to consolidate the maritime frontier.</p>
<h3>Communist Army, with Wang Zhen as Commander-in-Chief, Attacks Yulin in Three Routes, Fierce Fighting Also Occurring South of Fuxian County in Liaoning Province</h3>

<h3>First Review Committee Concludes, Amends and Passes Election Chapter, Adds Articles on Recall, Referendum, and Initiative</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The First Review Committee discussed "Elections" this morning, chaired by Liu Yaozhang, and discussed what kind of electoral system should be adopted for "Article 128". Xia Erkang of the Youth Party and others advocated for the proportional representation system in large electoral districts. Li Junfu of the Democratic Socialist Party also advocated the same. Ren Zhuoxuan and others from the Kuomintang advocated maintaining the original proposal. In the final vote, only a few people agreed to the amendment, so the original proposal was maintained. The Youth Party declared that it reserved the right to speak at the National Assembly. "Article 129" concerned the age requirements for electors and those eligible to be elected. A few representatives advocated adding provisions to the educational level of the electors, and some advocated changing the age of those eligible to be elected to 25. In the end, the original proposal was passed. "Article 130" concerned open elections. Zhang Shan proposed that fathers, sons, husbands, wives, and brothers should not run for election in the same district. Many opposed it, and the original proposal was maintained. "Articles 131" and "132" were passed smoothly. Finally, Zhang Zhiben requested that articles on recall, initiative, and referendum be added after the election articles so that the table with only one leg can be stabilized with four legs. It was resolved and passed to the Comprehensive Committee. The title of Chapter Twelve was changed to "Elections, Recall, Referendum, Initiative." The meeting ended at approximately 10:00 AM with applause.</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan Loves the Draft Constitution Early, Drafting a Constitution is Not About the Articles, But About Being Practical, A Constitutional Government Can Be Formed Within a Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] National Assembly representative and Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, recently published his opinions on the draft constitution. First, he said, "As far as I know, a constitution is the result of a country's revolution, a record of the rights that the general public obtains after the revolution and the obligations they should fulfill. At the same time, it is also a model for the government and the people to abide by together. Therefore, a constitution cannot but contain some ideals, but its ideals must be ones that can be realized in the near future. Otherwise, it is better to focus on practicality so that each chapter and article of the draft constitution is feasible. It is better to have a draft constitution with twenty or thirty plain and easy-to-implement articles than to have a draft constitution with two or three hundred lofty and difficult-to-implement articles. We participate in the work of drafting a constitution, but we only seek to promulgate a few articles that are necessary for the people and the government in the shortest period of time, which is more beneficial than delaying and not making a decision after discussion."</p>
<p>Mr. Pan continued, "The central government of China during the constitutional period must not only strive for democratization on the one hand, but also give it the power to handle affairs as quickly as possible on the other hand, so that it can be expected to be 'omnipotent' in the near future. I hope that the people and the government, in the early days of implementing constitutional governance after the promulgation of the constitution, can consolidate the foundation of democratic politics in China under the rule of law."</p>
<p>Mr. Pan also said that the Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution and the draft constitution submitted by the National Government this time each have their own characteristics, but the current draft constitution is revised based on the principle of consultation among the various parties, which is easier for all parties to accept. It is hoped that the National Assembly will have better revisions after exchanging opinions among all parties to make it more perfect. Generally, if there are better arrangements for the future organization and powers of the Legislative Yuan and the National Assembly, the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, and the powers of the central and local governments, then this definite constitution can be expected to be feasible.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan believes that during the current National Assembly, the representatives are discussing enthusiastically and reviewing extremely carefully. Although there are occasional disputes that lead to flushed faces or affect order, this is a common occurrence in parliaments of various countries and is not surprising. Mr. Pan also predicts that the Chinese constitutional government will be able to be formed within a year in accordance with the constitution.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Propaganda to Host Chinese and Foreign Reporters Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The Ministry of Propaganda will hold a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters at Anle Hall at 2:00 PM on the 16th, where Mr. Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party will answer questions related to the National Assembly.</p>

<h3>Dai Li Died in the Line of Duty, Approved to be Enshrined in the Martyrs' Shrine</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The new Deputy Ministers of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Industry, Chen Jianru and Luo Meihuan, arrived at the ministry this morning to take office.</p>

<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The delegation from Xikang Province petitioned the government this morning, requesting the removal of the provincial chairman, Liu Wenhui, and the reorganization of the provincial government, and the withdrawal of Liu's troops from the province. According to the delegation's announcement to the press, the Liu family is managing the provincial government alone, forcing the planting of opium, and monopolizing profits. One representative said that if the government does not remove him, the people of the province will automatically remove him.</p>
<h3>Pingbao Line, Through Traffic on the 20th, Jiaoji Railway Can Be Restored to its Original State Next Spring</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 14th] The PingSui Railway from Beiping to Chaigoubao, and from Datong to Baotou, have been repaired and opened to traffic. Between Tianzhen and Yanggao, the roadbed was severely damaged by the Communist army, and the bridges were excavated and blown up. The sleepers and rails were burned and destroyed. The repairs took time. After more than a month of efforts by the road bureau staff, they repaired day and night between Zhangyuan and Datong. The tracks were connected at Luowenzao in Yanggao on the 12th. The Ministry of Transportation’s Office in Zhang sent a train from Zhangyuan at 8:00 am on the 13th to conduct a formal test run. The results were very good. According to the person in charge of the road bureau, it is planned to start transporting trains, transport road repair materials and workers from today, and actively prepare to transport passengers. It is expected that through traffic on the entire Pingbao Line may be realized before the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Three sections of the Pinggu Line between Huairou and Tongjunzhuang were damaged last night. In addition, the Houfengtai Changli section of the Beiping-Ning Line was also slightly damaged.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 14th] The Jiaoji Railway after repairs will start traffic on the 16th, but the repair project has not been restored to its original state due to material restrictions. According to people from the bureau, if the project goes smoothly, the original state can be restored to 70-80% in March or April next spring.</p>
<h3>Miaofengshan Army was Expelled, The Fierce Battle Near Lugou Bridge is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Miaofeng Mountain, a famous scenic spot in western Beiping, has recently been stationed by the county security police regiment, and the Communist army there has been driven back.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] At 7:00 pm last night, a part of the 31st Brigade of the Communist army was active between Changxindian and Lugou Bridge, but no fighting occurred. It is inaccurate to say that there was a fierce battle near Lugou Bridge. There was also a small contact near Liulihe the night before.</p>
<h3>Youth Party Establishes Party Headquarters in Provinces such as North China, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi, Liu Siying Expresses Opinions on the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Liu Siying, Secretary-General of the Youth Party, told reporters on the 14th: (1) The Youth Party has established formal parties and party headquarters in North China, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi and other provinces. The organization of the party headquarters is roughly the same as that of the Kuomintang, and it is divided into provincial party headquarters, municipal party headquarters, and county party headquarters. In addition, the country is divided into several supervision areas. Liu himself is the person in charge of the North China Supervision Area. Zheng Dabu is the chairman of the Ping City Party Headquarters, Liu Jingyuan is the chairman of the Law City Party Headquarters, and Zhu Dewu is the chairman of the Ji Province Party Headquarters. Since this year, the Youth Party has been conducting open activities in various places. Only the Communist Party area has not yet been able to switch to above-ground activities. The Ping City Party Headquarters is now working in Dongsi Dayuan Hutong. Currently, party member registration is being carried out everywhere, and the exact number of party members is unknown. (2) The Youth Party has always advocated the nationalization of the army, so although there are also Youth Party members in the army, our party still allows them to be under the command of the central government. In answering reporters' questions, Liu denied that Liu Wenhui was a Youth Party member and was only sympathetic to the Youth Party. He also said: The January 28th Songhu Anti-Japanese War was launched by the Youth Party, Weng Zhaoyuan was a Youth Party member, and there were also Youth Party volunteers in the Northeast. (3) The Youth Party has no disagreement on participating in the National Assembly. The Youth Party's National Assembly list was handed over to Chairman Chiang by Zeng Qi and Li Huang, two close friends. Li Huang is by no means suffering from political illness.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Liu Siying issued his views on the Constitution on the 14th, stating: (1) Today's draft constitution is not the opinion of the Youth Party alone, but since it was passed by the Political Consultative Conference, our party should support it morally. If the National Assembly makes major revisions to the Political Consultative Conference's draft constitution, our party will reserve its opinions and continue to fight. It is very common for a political party to advocate for a cause for ten or twenty years. (2) Candidates for public office must pass an examination, which deprives people of their right to vote and should be abolished. (3) Although the president can have the power of emergency disposition, it is inappropriate to expand this power to financial matters. (4) It is not good for the Legislative Yuan to be a permanent body, because the legislators are elected from various regions, and it already takes a lot of time and money to go to Beijing twice a year for meetings.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Draft Constitution, The Content is Divided into Five Points</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] It is rumored that the Communist Party has drafted a constitution and is preparing to submit it when the "People's Congress" is convened. Recently, local officials announced that the content of the draft constitution was based on the Communist Party's opinions on the draft constitution submitted to the Political Consultative Conference in April. The important points are five: (1) Acknowledge that the chairman is the supreme leader of China and is willing to uphold the Three Principles of the People as the basic principles of national construction. (2) The Kuomintang should not account for more than one-third of the National Assembly representatives, the Communist Party should account for one-third, and other parties and non-party members should account for one-third. (3) Provincial and county heads are elected by the people. (4) Provinces can formulate provincial constitutions without violating the Constitution. (5) Establish a joint command headquarters to command the national army. This joint command headquarters is jointly composed of personnel from various parties. Officials also stated that the Communist Party is preparing to announce it first to confront the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] It is reported that the Communist Party is actively preparing for the People's Congress and is about to formulate a constitution. Someone in Beijing has seen the draft of the constitution.</p>
<h3>Safeguarding the Livelihoods of News Reporters: Constitutional Draft Review Meeting Resolves to Submit for Assembly Discussion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Representatives of the National Assembly's news reporter professional group, Bao Mingshu, Chen Kanghe, Tang Qi, Ling Shaozu, and others, in order to ensure that the livelihoods and work of news professionals are legally protected by the state, recently proposed to the National Assembly to amend Article 145 of the constitutional draft, which states, "The state shall protect the livelihoods and working conditions of those engaged in education, science, art, and culture," by adding the words "news" after the word "science." This has been approved by the review meeting and submitted to the assembly for discussion, with the hope of its passage. The reasons stated in the proposal are as follows: News reporters, during the revolutionary war of resistance, sacrificed countless lives, blood, and sweat in order to fulfill their missions, choosing righteousness over personal gain. The stories of Song Yufu and Huang Yuansheng are but a few historical examples. News reports, editorials, and commentaries, once published in black and white, carry unlimited responsibility, sometimes with immediate consequences. During the war of resistance, news reporters ventured into battlefields, braving danger, airplanes, tanks, gunfire, and artillery shells, enduring countless deaths, injuries, and captures. Even in times of peace, news reporters must work day and night, pursuing news targets regardless of distance, time, weather, or personal discomfort. Their sense of responsibility allows no hesitation. News reporters must possess the physical strength to run and endure hunger, and the talent to speak and write, yet they are often met with scorn and ridicule, which is commonplace. They face harsh environments daily, which constantly threaten their lives. Consider how few of the countless young reporters become white-haired veterans of the profession. The hardship of their work and the difficulty of their lives are no less than those of laborers, and the mental exertion they endure surpasses that of any other profession. The state should provide special protection for them, which is only fitting. Therefore, it is proposed to add the word "news" after the word "science" in Article 145 of the constitution. Please vote in favor.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables the National Assembly, Requesting a Decision to Establish the Capital in Nanjing</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday cabled the National Assembly, stating: "According to reports, the issue of the capital in the constitution is subject to various opinions and unresolved debates. This chamber believes that the capital, as the political center, must be closely linked to the economic center. Although the Tang Dynasty established its capital in the Yellow River basin, the center of gravity was actually in the Jianghuai region. From the An Lushan Rebellion and the emergence of regional warlords onwards, the empire often relied on the tax revenues of Jianghuai as the foundation for pacification. While the three garrisons of Hebei were restless, the area between Liang and Yi remained safe and sound, at that time known as ‘Yang first, Yi second’. After the Tang and Song dynasties, the situation in the Southeast increasingly affected the overall safety and stability of the country. Although the Yuan and Ming dynasties established their capitals in Beiping, the capital was in danger as soon as the Grand Canal was interrupted. Therefore, the safety of river and sea transport was linked to the national plans of the Yuan and Ming dynasties. This demonstrates that the political center and the economic center cannot be separated, like paralysis in a human body. The Yuan and Ming dynasties suffered from this problem. We must not repeat the same mistakes. We propose that the National Assembly adopt Huang Zongxi of the Ming Dynasty's wise plans and follow the teachings of the Founding Father to decide on establishing the capital in Nanjing. As for the claim that establishing the capital in Beiping would be beneficial for national defense, it does not seem justified. Since the Ming Dynasty abandoned Danning in the east and ceded Dongsheng in the west, the nine border garrisons never had a peaceful day. During the Jiajing era, the capital was threatened by invasions every year. History is not far removed; there is no reason to emulate it. Before the Qing Dynasty established trade relations, the reason why the capital could be secure was due to the consolidation of the outlying regions. Today, circumstances have changed, science has advanced, and the national defense landscape has also transformed. Furthermore, in accordance with the sound practices of modern parliamentary politics, current representative bodies must accommodate people from all walks of life, allowing them to freely discuss and deliberate together, in order to reflect the reality of popular politics. Therefore, we request that the constitution, in addition to adopting a regional representation system, also adopt a professional representation system, so that everyone has the opportunity to serve the country. This is our deepest hope."</p>
<p>The Immense Contributions of the Professional Sector: Representatives Should Be Included in the Constitution</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Fang Zhi, chairman of the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, and committee members Chen Baoyi, Zhuang Heren, Shen Chunhui, Ge Kexin, Zhou Feicheng, Zai Shixi, Xie Dahuang, Chen Baotai, Wang Xianqing, Qian Jianqiu, Zhou Xuexiang, Xie Renzhao, Tao Baichuan, Luo Qinghua, Xu Mingya, Wu Kaixian, and Zhang Xiaosong, yesterday sent a cable to the National Assembly, stating their reasons and requesting that professional representatives be included in the constitution. During the eight-year war of resistance, the various professional units exerted tremendous power and made significant contributions to the country. Moreover, in terms of the participants in this assembly, professional representatives also occupy a considerable number of seats. Professional organizations are able to participate in the constitution-making process today, but if they are not allowed to participate in the constitution-implementing process in the future, this would be contrary to both law and reason, and also inconsistent with human sentiment. Therefore, we dare to express our humble opinion in a cable, earnestly requesting that based on facts and reason, professional representatives be included in the constitutional draft, so that the National Assembly in the future can truly represent the consciousness of all sectors of society and reflect them in national policies, in order to jointly implement the constitution and build the nation together.</p>

<h3>The Ruin of Industry in Our Northeastern Provinces: The Soviet Union Should Bear Major Responsibility: The Release of Paulley's Official Investigative Report</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] According to reliable sources obtained here tonight: Reparations Commissioner Paulley has reported to the State Department that the Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment from the Northeast has delayed China's economic development by thirty years, while also hindering U.S. policy. Paulley's report is based on investigations conducted this summer together with experts from MacArthur's headquarters.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] The official report submitted to President Truman by Japanese reparations investigation commissioner Pauley on November 12 was released to members of Congress today. The report straightforwardly points out that the Soviet Union should bear major responsibility for the ruined state of industry in China's Northeastern provinces. It also states that Japanese military equipment and ammunition seized by the Soviets fell into the hands of the Chinese Communists with the unintentional cooperation of the Soviet Union. Pauley claims that the chaos caused by this Soviet action has created a state of political and economic instability that will take a long time to correct. The local people are suffering from hunger, cold, and unrest. The Northeastern provinces, rich in resources and factories, should logically be the starting point for China's revival.</p>
<h3>Moving and Destroying Industry in the Northeast Has Far-Reaching Strategic Implications</h3>
<p>From the time of Japan's surrender until the Pauley investigation team conducted its on-site inspection, the losses to factories in the Northeastern provinces were estimated at $2 billion. It has not been possible to accurately estimate how much of the damage was directly caused by the Soviets, and how much should be attributed to looting, civil war, and the indirect results of the Soviet occupation. In any case, the Soviet government must bear major responsibility. The excuse that the removed materials were "war booty" needed to compensate for the losses suffered by the Soviet Union from German aggression does not fully conceal the facts. For example, the situation in Korea was completely different. In fact there was no important removal or destruction of Korean industry, which is clear proof that the Soviet policy had far-reaching strategic implications. It also cannot be justified to say that the benefits the Soviet Union gained from moving goods from the Northeastern provinces could have been replaced by reparations from the Japanese mainland. In addition to the industrial removals, the Soviet army also confiscated $3 million worth of gold bars. Although the investigation team did not find direct evidence proving that the Soviet Union had aided the Chinese Communists in the Northeastern provinces, it is true that the Soviet Union did not hinder the Chinese Communists. Large quantities of Japanese military supplies and ammunition seized by the Soviet Union fell into the hands of the Chinese Communists with the Soviet Union's intentional or unintentional cooperation. Restoring the industry in the Northeastern provinces requires remembering that the Northeastern provinces are in fact surrounded by territory wholly or partially controlled by the Soviet Union, making this vast area vulnerable to further Soviet encroachment. The Soviet Union's short campaign in the Northeastern provinces does not entitle the Soviet government to consider the majority of Japanese assets in the Northeastern provinces as reparations. Other countries also have the right to make claims. In short, the Soviet Union's confiscation and removal of food supplies and machinery in the Northeastern provinces, as well as the damage caused at the same time and afterwards, caused the local production to almost completely stop, greatly harming the Chinese people, and showing no consideration at all. All of this proves that there were far-sighted strategic reasons behind the Soviet actions. The Soviet Union not only industrially damaged the area, but even encouraged Chinese mobs to loot and even filmed their looting.</p>
<h3>Ignoring the Provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty: Dalian Has Actually Been Blockaded</h3>
<p>Pauley continued: The Soviet Union took most of the electrical equipment, experimental plants, experimental projects, and hospitals from the Northeastern provinces, as well as the newest and best machine tools. Not only were houses and building equipment removed, but also equipment such as generators and mining water pumps, causing electricity to stop and mine shafts to be flooded, causing significant losses. The removal of electrical equipment halted all existing industrial production. Water and drainage projects in major cities could not operate due to insufficient power. The Sino-Soviet treaty of August 1945 stipulated that Dalian would be a free port and that the Soviet Union would only have the right to use a portion of the port's facilities. The Sino-Soviet Union ignored the treaty provisions and actually blockaded it for its own use. The damage the Soviet Union caused in the Northeastern provinces can be estimated in U.S. dollars as follows:</p>
<p>Electricity: $21.1 million</p>
<p>Coal: $50 million</p>
<p>Steel: $13.126 million</p>
<p>Railways: $22.139 million</p>
<p>Metallurgical Engineering: $16.3 million</p>
<p>Non-ferrous Minerals (excluding coal): $10 million</p>
<p>Liquid Fuels and Lubricants: $1.038 million</p>
<p>Chemicals: $14 million</p>
<p>Cement: $2.3 million</p>
<p>Textiles: $3.8 million</p>
<p>Paper and Pulp: $7 million</p>
<p>Wireless, Telephone, and Telegraph: $2.5 million</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Obtained Rich Uranium Deposits in the Northeast: American Newspapers Claimed it was a Reliable Report</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 13th] A dispatch from Shanghai by Scripps-Howard newspaper reporter Niu Deng cited reliable sources as saying that in addition to recently obtaining large quantities of tungsten ore from the Chinese government, the Soviet Union has also obtained rich uranium ore recently discovered in China. The reporter claimed that, according to reliable information, this uranium ore was originally discovered by the Japanese army in Haicheng, Liaoning, in the Northeast. Haicheng is 140 miles from the Soviet military base of Lushun.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Cables Reply to Zhou Enlai and Others: No Injustice in the Distribution of Supplies: The Chinese Communists Cable Again, Requesting to Attend the UNRRA Council Meeting</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu sent the following three suggestions to UNRRA Director LaGuardia on the 4th: (1) Request to directly carry out relief work in the "Liberated Areas" of China; (2) Allocate a reasonable portion of the untouched supplies to the "Liberated Areas" of China, to be distributed jointly by the "Liberated Areas Relief Association" and UNRRA; (3) Representatives of the "Liberated Areas Relief Association" should be invited to attend the UNRRA Council meeting to be held in Washington on December 10. UNRRA Deputy Director Lucks cabled back on the 9th, stating that relief work in the "Liberated Areas" was underway, and that the matter of attending the UNRRA Council meeting had been referred to Li Zhuomin, the official representative of China. After receiving this cable, the Chinese Communist delegation felt that it was unfair, and on the 13th, they cabled UNRRA Director and the Council again, once again requesting that the Chinese Communist requests be submitted for discussion by the Council.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Wu Yunfu and Cheng Run, representatives of the Chinese Communist "Liberated Areas Relief Association" stationed in Shanghai, yesterday received reporters at Zhou Enlai's residence on Sinan Road, and released two telegrams signed by Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu on December 13, one to UNRRA Director LaGuardia and one to LaGuardia and the Council. These two telegrams were a response to General Lucks' cable, which refused to consider the Chinese Communist proposals.</p>
<p>Lucks' Reply Cable</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 14th] General Lucks, who will succeed UNRRA Director as of December 31 (currently Deputy Director), specifically cabled Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu today, regarding Chinese Communist criticism that UNRRA's distribution of relief supplies to the liberated areas was unfair, stating that the fair distribution of UNRRA supplies continues to be the firm goal of UNRRA in China. The UNRRA office in China is continuing to pay close attention to overcoming transportation and other difficulties in order to achieve the aforementioned goal. Both the UNRRA office in China and the Executive Yuan state that they are taking active steps to develop and use available transportation assets to transport supplies to areas in need. General Lucks also said that a definite agreement has been reached regarding assistance to residents of the Yellow River area, and that this plan, which is of great importance to China, is expected to be completed smoothly. General Lucks' cable continued, regarding the request for the UNRRA "Liberated Areas Relief Association" to establish an agreement, that Wu Yunfu, the liaison officer of the latter stationed at the Executive Yuan in Shanghai, has been in regular contact with UNRRA and the Executive Yuan regarding relief matters in the "Liberated Areas." It is also understood that officials of the Liberated Areas Relief Association in various regions are actively participating in the distribution of supplies, and it is believed that this measure will increasingly improve the effectiveness of the assistance. As for your request to invite a representative of the "Liberated Areas Relief Association" to attend the 6th Council meeting of UNRRA, it has been submitted to Li Zhuomin, the chief representative of China, but each section of the incoming cable will not be discussed at the 6th meeting of UNRRA.</p>
<p>Zhou and Dong's Cables Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu, Chairman of the Chinese Communist "Liberated Areas Relief Association," after receiving Lucks' cable, replied to LaGuardia, saying that Lucks did not understand the political divisions regarding relief affairs in China, and the seriousness of the unfair distribution, and that Lucks' refusal to submit our statement for discussion at the 6th meeting of UNRRA in itself constituted discriminatory and unfair behavior, which was extremely regrettable. We believe that discussing this matter at the UNRRA meeting is the most satisfactory solution to the serious state of relief work in the country, so we cannot help but make this request again.</p>
<p>Another telegram from Zhou and Dong to LaGuardia stated: The black curtain of relief work in China previously revealed by 300 UNRRA staff members, such as corruption, using relief goods for civil war, and unfair distribution, has not improved at all. UNRRA's basic policy of non-political discrimination has not been followed. Although the Liberated Areas Relief Association has a liaison officer stationed at the Executive Yuan in Shanghai, the officer has no power and therefore cannot be considered an improvement. Furthermore, the issue of fair distribution of relief goods itself is extremely urgent.</p>
<h3>UNRRA is Planning to Reclaim Farmland in Flood-Affected Areas in China: Repairing the Yellow River Levees to Prevent Flooding</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] UNRRA authorities hope to reclaim 2 million mu of farmland in flood-affected areas of China in 1947. This is one of the main plans for UNRRA's final fiscal year, which stipulates the repair of Yellow River levees in Henan, Anhui, and Shandong provinces to prevent flooding and facilitate planting. These levees were destroyed during the war of resistance to hinder the Japanese advance. UNRRA is dissolving, but less than half of the $535 million plan for China has been completed, and it will be completed to the extent permitted by the military and political situation in China.</p>
<h3>The Refugee Problem in Nanjing is Serious: The Central Government Will Send Senior Officials to Handle Relief: Relevant Authorities Formulating Solutions</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The refugee problem in Nanjing is becoming increasingly serious. According to statistics from two weeks ago, there are already 12,000 people concentrated in Xiaguan, and another 2,000 arrived yesterday, with more expected to arrive. Shen Yi said at a press conference on the afternoon of the 14th: "This is a current national problem that the city of Nanjing itself can solve. The central government is paying close attention to this. In addition to personally inspecting the refugee areas, President Chiang personally instructed the Joint Logistics Headquarters to distribute cotton clothing. The central government may appoint senior officials to handle this matter specifically." He also pointed out that this matter is related to the blocking of the Yellow River, because the blocking project has not been carried out smoothly for some reason, and the floods in Anhui province are quite serious, with as many as 10 million refugees in one province. Some of them are taking refuge in Nanjing, and the number of arrivals is increasing daily. Fortunately, with the assistance of all parties, the refugees' clothing, food, and housing have been adequately resolved. Now, the central government and relevant parties intend to use the following methods to deal with this problem: (1) For the sake of getting to the root of the problem, they plan to engage in relief work upstream, so as not to trek to Nanjing; (2) Sending refugees back to their hometowns, about 2,000 people have been sent, but some have returned; (3) Using the method of work-for-relief to solve the lives of young refugees. The dike committee recently held a meeting on this.</p>
<h3>Nanjing's Population is Close to One Million: More than 200,000 Unemployed</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Nanjing Police Department announced that in November, the population was 575,232 men and 408,028 women, for a total of 983,260 people, an increase of 53,255 people compared to October. There are 243,097 unemployed people and 77,334 children out of school.</p>
<h3>The Yongding River Levees in Hebei Will Begin Construction Soon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 14th] During the late Qing Dynasty, the Yongding River was "heavy on the north and light on the south," and the levees were completely submerged by wind and sand. The section from Hulubao to Focun in Wanping County is particularly vulnerable to floods during each flood season. In order to solve the problem once and for all, the Hebei Provincial Government has formulated a repair plan and requested 360,000 pounds of relief flour from the UNRRA Tianjin branch to be used as food for the workers. The Wanping County Provisional Assembly has recently established an advisory committee for the Yongding River south bank repair project. It is expected that the entire project will be completed before the major floods next June. The section will require 60,000 workers, and construction can begin within days.</p>
<h3>We Are Negotiating with the Philippine Authorities: Overseas Chinese Seek to Build Their Own Markets: Requesting that the Philippine Nationalization Act be Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 13th] According to the observations of local impartial people, in order to achieve a more deliberate solution to the order to nationalize the markets in the Philippines, fair principles must be applied, and both countries should mutually recognize each other's difficulties, and consider the historical background and the implications of the special status of overseas Chinese in the Philippines today. The legal issue of Republic Act No. 37, the National Public Market Act, has recently arisen. It authorizes the Ministry of Finance to formulate regulations for the management of markets. At a recent meeting, city senators pointed out that the Ministry of Finance is an administrative body, not a legislative body, and has no right to formulate this decree. Furthermore, no international law or other laws can ignore the established facts. History records that overseas Chinese have been doing business in the Philippine markets for over a century. During Spanish rule of the Philippines, overseas Chinese were actively engaged in commercial activities in the markets. After years of arduous struggle and work, they finally completed prosperous careers in these businesses. Over time, Filipinos gradually entered a new stage of recognition of this important industry. Although they attempted to compete with overseas Chinese vendors, they repeatedly failed. During American rule of the Philippines, Filipinos repeatedly resolved to use laws to expel overseas Chinese from the markets, but they were unsuccessful. Now, due to this feeling of jealousy, Filipinos are engaged in formulating laws to exclude overseas Chinese from the markets. Roxas signed this decree on October 1. Since then, Philippine officials have repeatedly stated that this decree is not discriminatory or intended to exclude overseas Chinese merchants, but as a result, overseas Chinese vendors are in danger of being forced to withdraw from public markets due to restrictions imposed by regulations announced by the Ministry of Finance. This sudden order from the Philippine authorities will undoubtedly have a serious impact on 1,045 law-abiding overseas Chinese and their 2,000 family members in the Philippines. In addition to legal issues, local impartial people have raised another question: Whether the actions taken will achieve the desired goals of the initiators. President Roxas hopes that this bill will further encourage Filipinos to engage in retail commerce, so that they can compete more effectively with foreigners, but in reality, overseas Chinese only account for 10% of the entire market stalls in the Philippines, and they are not actually in a controlling position in the market commerce of the Philippines. Since rejecting this bill is impossible, the only way out is to establish overseas Chinese' own markets. This is what Roxas allowed, and later suggested by Quirino. It is heard that our embassy will seek special approval from the parliament or reach an administrative agreement with the Philippine government to approve overseas Chinese to operate their own markets, while also requesting the Philippine government to postpone the implementation of the bill until the overseas Chinese markets have been established. If such a method fails, the only option left for the overseas Chinese is to file a lawsuit in the International Court of Justice.</p>
<h3>Neutral Zone for Overseas Chinese Established in Haiphong: We Are Seriously Negotiating: The Unfriendly Behavior of the Vietnamese is Increasing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Regarding the threat to the lives and property of overseas Chinese in Haiphong, according to Ye Gongchao, director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Our demand for the establishment of a neutral zone for overseas Chinese in Haiphong has never changed its position, because the Vietnamese-French dispute has not been satisfactorily resolved, and our overseas Chinese compatriots will continue to feel unpredictable threats. The government is currently seriously negotiating with both sides, urging the rapid delineation of the neutral zone.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 13th] At a time when Franco-Vietnamese relations are deteriorating, although the Vietnamese government authorities have repeatedly stated that they will protect overseas Chinese and that Sino-Vietnamese relations are friendly, since the Franco-Vietnamese conflicts in Haiphong and Lang Son, according to reports from various sources, the attitude of Vietnamese towards overseas Chinese has become increasingly hostile. Although the Vietnamese government authorities have no intention of excluding overseas Chinese, the fact that Vietnamese people are hostile to overseas Chinese in Haiphong, Lang Son, Hanoi, and other places has been repeatedly seen. In Haiphong, during the Franco-Vietnamese conflict, more than 300 overseas Chinese were groundlessly captured by Vietnamese soldiers. The Vietnamese government has recently used the excuse of instability to search the residences and shops of overseas Chinese in various places on a large scale. When arresting our overseas Chinese compatriots without cause, they are accused of colluding with the French army to resist the Vietnamese government, or even accused of being bandits. The certificates issued by our consulates held by overseas Chinese compatriots are not respected. Our Consul General in Hanoi, Yuan Zijian, believes that the neutral status of overseas Chinese in the Franco-Vietnamese conflict should be respected by both parties, and has asked both parties to take measures to protect the safety of overseas Chinese. The Franco-Vietnamese authorities have also reiterated their commitment to do their best to protect them. In fact, reports of overseas Chinese being oppressed by Vietnamese people and their residences being searched are still frequently heard, and the unfriendly behavior of Vietnamese towards overseas Chinese continues to increase.</p>
<h3>Our Chargé d'Affaires in India, Xue Shouheng, Bestows Medals on Behalf of the Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 13th] Our Chargé d'Affaires in India, Xue Shouheng, recently bestowed the Special Grand Cordon of the Yun Hui Medal to Major General Dunford, Quartermaster General of the Indian Army, and the Special Grand Cordon of the Brilliant Star Medal to Colonel Thapa, Consul General of Nepal in the United Kingdom, on behalf of our government. The medal-awarding ceremony was held at the Chinese Embassy. Shen Zonglian, head of the Chinese Nepalese visiting delegation, specially came from Calcutta to attend the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Bowers' Stolen Documents: Investigation Without Clues: Bowers Thanks Us for Our Cordial Hospitality</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 13th] Sir Bowers, head of the British trade delegation to China, had his briefcase containing official documents stolen on the street yesterday. Police arrested three suspects related to the incident this afternoon, but the stolen briefcase containing the official documents is still missing.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] On the eve of his return to the United Kingdom, Bowers issued a statement thanking the Chinese government and the Hong Kong government for their cordial hospitality to his delegation. Bowers said: The delegation members have had direct and extensive discussions with the people of China and the United Kingdom. Chinese officials freely discussed China's various future economic plans with the delegation members. They were well-received by President Chiang in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>He Siyuan Plans to Build a New Beiping into an International Tourist City</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Our country has signed an agreement with American Airlines to open three air routes, directly from the United States to China.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Prerequisite for Saving Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>When it comes to politics, everyone feels that the biggest problem now is the lack of cooperation in all aspects. If the Kuomintang and the Communist Party sincerely cooperate, then all military, financial, economic, transportation, and other issues would have been easily resolved. In the past year or so, the results of all restoration work would definitely not be lower than those of the defeated countries.</p>
<p>Politics is like this, and economics is no exception. The crisis in industry and commerce is deepening day by day. All parties are racking their brains, trying to find the source of the disease, hoping to prescribe the right medicine and apply an emergency and effective treatment. Unfortunately, all kinds of diseases have broken out, and there are too many clues, making it feel like a tangled mess that cannot be untangled. Many people have become pessimistic about this, believing that the future is not bright. Everyone feels that during the Anti-Japanese War, although there were many difficulties and hardships, everyone still felt that there was a shadow of final victory in front of them, vaguely visible. No matter how difficult it was, they could still comfort themselves and not fall into a state of confusion and despair. However, the current economic situation is getting more and more serious, and collapse is imminent, but there is no bright shadow leading the way, and there is no definite and feasible way to solve it. Inevitably, they go from anxiety to confusion, and from confusion to seeming to enter despair and hopelessness. Aren't most industries and businesses struggling blindly now? How much of the future business direction has a reliable grasp?</p>
<p>So, what is the source of the disease? Is there a way to save it? The answer doesn't seem hard to find. Because after carefully examining everything, we feel that all the problems, like politics, arise and grow from the point of non-cooperation. Therefore, to prescribe the right medicine, we only need to start from the point of cooperation, and it will not be difficult to achieve success day by day. Here are a few facts to prove it.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that high interest rates, high wages, and high tax rates are now the fatal wounds of the industrial and commercial sectors. But as far as high interest rates are concerned, it is not really impossible to suppress them. The law of supply and demand tells us that as long as the money supply is ample and financing is convenient, then the interbank lending rate will naturally fall. If general industrialists and merchants can borrow from banks and money houses at a low interest rate of four or five percent, why would they borrow high interest rates of twenty or thirty percent from money lending companies? The problem is that it is really not easy to borrow at a low interest rate of four or five percent. Those who can borrow must be given more favorable conditions. However, commercial firms that adjust surpluses and deficits do not actually have enough chips to turn around, and those with sufficient chips are inconvenient to supply funds at any time for various reasons. The supply of funds will create many unexpected evils, such as grain loans, hoarding, speculation, and re-lending at high interest rates, which are often heard. Recently, a certain silk factory borrowed 100 million yuan and went bankrupt. From this point of view, although there are many types of loans in terms of supply, are their quantity and method capable of curbing high interest rates? In terms of demand, are all the funds used for legitimate purposes? It seems that both parties have not carefully considered these questions. That is to say, neither party has sincerely cooperated to find an effective solution to the problem. They are just dealing with the problem piecemeal and superficially. If this continues, how can high interest rates be curbed?</p>
<p>When it comes to wages, the general view is that current wages seem to be too high compared to other general salaries. Comparing domestic and foreign prices, we also feel that the cost of domestic goods is too high. But how to reduce costs and how to adjust wages is still an ideal. In other words, so-called labor-management cooperation is still just empty talk in general.</p>
<p>Then there is the issue of high tax rates. This includes too many types and various burdens similar to taxes. If we say that the authorities are far away and do not know this pain, then we would be slandering them. However, due to the facts, we cannot avoid taking care of one thing and losing sight of another. When we are eager to eat chicken eggs, we cannot take care of the life of the chicken. If we can shift our focus from the concept of pure income to the tax policy and even the conservation policy, that is to say, if the government and businesses truly cooperate to resolve the current crisis in industry and commerce, then this is an easy task, and it is not very difficult.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there are also foreign goods dumping, rampant smuggling, high freight rates, lack of raw materials, insufficient power, and improper control, which are also important factors causing the economic crisis, but there are not countermeasures. What is regrettable is that while working hard to solve the problem, some are secretly destroying it, while enduring sacrifices, some are profiting from it, and some of the handlers do not care about life or death, using their power to plan for personal gain. As a result, all good laws and intentions are mixed with other private interests and effects, or are insincere, or are changed in form and name, so-called the oranges become trifoliate oranges when they cross the Huai River, and finally the desired effect is not achieved. Therefore, the current crisis in industry and commerce is not without a solution, but the problem is that all parties do not have the sincerity to cooperate, so that the law cannot be implemented, or the implementation is not thorough. If we want to achieve results, first of all, we must start from the practical cooperation of all parties.</p>

<h3>Huangyan Fire: Half the City Burned Down</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] A major fire broke out in Huangyan County on the 8th of this month at 2:00 AM, destroying nearly half the city.

More than 60 buildings were completely destroyed, and a large number of people were burned to death, a truly tragic sight. The infants' home, with hundreds of babies, was also burned alive. When the fire was raging and the firefighters were unable to do anything, Speaker Zhu of the County Council wanted to tap the Jiu Feng Spring source to extinguish the fire, but this did not happen because of the saying "distant water cannot quench a nearby fire" (Jiu Feng is about five li from the county seat). The fire was finally extinguished after burning for more than ten hours. The extent of the losses is currently difficult to estimate, but it is certainly in the tens of millions. Huangyan has been suffering from a drought for more than a month. Now, with the fire, the vitality has been greatly damaged, and recovery will be very difficult.</p>

(2) In the above-mentioned areas, the mountain roads, trenches, fortresses, and various field defense works previously built by the troops must also be properly protected and not destroyed. If farmers need to pass through various construction projects to cultivate land or irrigate, they must use bamboo pipes for access and handle them with caution.</p>

<h3>A Diligent County Annals Museum</h3>
<p>Editor: In this atmosphere of political turmoil and economic unrest, social figures are either struggling for a living or running for profit, and cultural undertakings have long been neglected. Especially, literary works like gazetteers have long carried the feeling of "Uselessness and not to be done!"</p>
<p>Recently, I returned to my long-separated hometown—Tangqi Town in Hangzhou County—In this town with an area of ​​several square miles, a Hangzhou County Annals Museum has recently been established, and many local well-known scholars have gathered in the museum, tirelessly devoting themselves to writing, which can be thanked as a modern cultural miracle. The county annals museum is located on the top floor of the Yuchuan Shushu Building on the south bank of the Grand Canal in the town, which is close to the city center but free from the noise. Without someone pointing the way, it is not easy to find the entrance. Inside, it is high, bright, quiet, and secluded, with bright windows and clean windows. In addition to the arrangement of several bookshelves and writing desks, only a few encouraging inscriptions from contemporary celebrities are hung, and the stack of old papers on the desk reflects a simple and unpretentious mood. Curator Wang Jianqing is a humble elder. He said to the author: "The county annals have not been revised for more than two hundred years. Due to the evolution of the times, the division of counties and cities, changes in mountains and rivers, and the loss of documents, it is urgent to continue the past and open up the future and revise the annals. County Magistrate Chen Wen hired people to establish the museum and actively carried out the work. At present, the compilation outline and the annual progress schedule have been approved. Following this compilation, it is necessary to conduct on-site investigations for matters related to the local area, products, water conservancy, and farmland, which are closely related to people's livelihoods, and it is necessary to use scientific methods to explain, understand, and verify the achievements. I believe that if we use it to do it, we will definitely be able to complete the mission. One of the compilation gentlemen in the museum, Yao Zhufu Xiaolian, used to be the president of the Salt Industry News and served as an editor at the Zhonghua Book Company for many years. His articles, textbooks, and teaching materials have long enjoyed a high reputation in the cultural world, and he once competed with Chen Sanli and Zhu Jiangcun. He has compiled the Haining Annals and other works, and is also an experienced craftsman. In addition, the gentlemen who are in charge of the compilation, Luo Jingfu and Xu Keqing, are all experts in history, geography, physics, commerce, and agriculture. Deputy Curator Lu Shushi has enjoyed a long-standing reputation in the party and political circles in the past. Today, he is dedicated to cultural undertakings and is also a first-class choice. On the one hand, we continue to visit and hire Hongshuo in this county in order to complete a gazetteer without any regrets."</p>
<p>Finally, Curator Wang said to the author very sincerely: "At the beginning of the establishment of this museum, there were not many funds, but in view of the fact that society is in a period of destruction to construction, if everyone does not put in some hard work, there is no hope for the future of the country. Therefore, I and the gentlemen in the museum, based on this awareness, write and research hard, and do not resign from hardships; in the past, although we could not hold the sword to defend the country, now we can only devote ourselves to the pen to fulfill our national duty." This time I returned to my hometown, I personally saw the academic style and diligent spirit of the Hangzhou County Annals Museum, and I was very impressed. I specially introduced it to the cultural fighters in the city to create a sense of inspiration and encourage them to move forward. (Xue Chu)</p>

<h3>UNGA Debates Disarmament: US, UK, and Soviet Union All Support; Bevin Reports US Overseas Troops Less Than 550,000; Molotov Speaks Out Against Keeping Atomic Bomb Secrets</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 14th] When the United Nations General Assembly debated the issue of disarmament yesterday, US Secretary of State Byrnes gave a speech stating that the United States has less than 550,000 troops stationed abroad, of which 19,000 are stationed in China at the request of the Chinese government. The majority of the rest are stationed in Germany, Japan, Korea, Austria, and Venezia Giulia. Apart from the US occupation zones in Germany and Austria, the US only has "combat troops" stationed in the Philippines, China, and the Panama Canal Zone. Byrnes denied that the presence of US troops in China is a threat to peace. When referring to the issue of atomic weapons, Byrnes said, "If other countries agree to the control and supervision of atomic weapons, then the United States is willing to share its knowledge of manufacturing atomic weapons with other countries. If other countries do not have atomic bombs or cannot manufacture them, then they will easily agree to the control and supervision system. The Atomic Energy Commission should accelerate its work as much as possible. In short, we want to unite with all countries to jointly safeguard peace, not to engage in war. We want to strengthen international law so that the people of all countries in the world can obtain freedom and happiness."</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Bevin then spoke, agreeing with Byrnes's proposal, stating, "The United Kingdom currently has less than one million troops, which is very few. When it comes to atomic control, if countries have political prejudices, then the Atomic Energy Commission will not be able to find a solution. In short, we are always ready to provide the General Assembly with any information it needs in order to implement the various principles in the Charter."</p>
<p>[Our New York Correspondent's Exclusive Dispatch, 14th] When the United Nations General Assembly discussed the issue of universal disarmament yesterday, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union all expressed their full support. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov spoke after Bevin, but did not announce the number of Soviet troops at home or abroad, but repeatedly requested a comprehensive investigation of the troops of all countries. Molotov continued by saying that the United States' keeping the atomic bomb secret threatens world peace. Judging from the nature of the atomic bomb, it is used in the territory of other countries, not for defense, but clearly as an offensive weapon. Regarding the universal disarmament case, Molotov reiterated the Soviet Union's request that the investigation of the world's military situation must include the announcement of the location of troops of all member states and their missions. After Molotov's speech, the General Assembly announced that it would adjourn until 11:00 AM the next day, when it would discuss the Soviet Union's request for an investigation of troops.</p>
<h3>Political and Security Committee Passes Universal Disarmament Plan; Compromise on Troop Investigation Not Reached; To Be Sent Back to the General Assembly for Reconsideration</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 13th] The UNGA Political and Security Committee today unanimously passed a universal disarmament plan, but the troop investigation case was decided by a vote of 29 to 4 to be submitted to the Security Council for discussion. The Soviet Union alone expressed dissent. The compromise plan for the investigation was proposed by the President of the General Assembly, Spaak, who urged the Security Council to decide as soon as possible which reports to invite member states to submit. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is prepared to fight again at the General Assembly plenary meeting, and US Secretary of State Byrnes is also considering speaking on this issue. British Foreign Secretary Bevin will also attend with the delegation before departing for his country on the 14th of this month. The crux of the troop investigation issue is the Soviet Union's insistence that a complete report on armaments, including the atomic bomb, should be attached to any report on domestic troops. In its proposal, the Soviet Union only requested an investigation of the number of troops stationed abroad. Another complex issue is the United Kingdom's request for a permanent court to verify such reports, so the committee could not reach a compromise on this.</p>
<h3>Establishment of International Inspection Agency: Security Council Drafts Plan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 13th] The Political and Security Committee today unanimously passed a resolution urging the Security Council to immediately draft a plan for the establishment of an international agency to supervise and control atomic weapons and other collective destructive tools. This resolution has now been submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for approval. The resolution is divided into nine points: (1) The General Assembly recognizes the need to implement universal disarmament as soon as possible. (2) It urges the Security Council to adopt all practical and necessary measures as a matter of urgency to achieve this goal. The various plans drafted by the Security Council for this purpose should be sent to all member states of the United Nations and then reviewed by a special meeting of the General Assembly. (3) It urges the Atomic Energy Commission to adopt methods for controlling atomic energy so that its use is limited to peaceful purposes. (4) The General Assembly should urge the Security Council to review the report of the Atomic Energy Commission as soon as possible so that the work of the commission can proceed smoothly. (5) The General Assembly should ask the Security Council to draft relevant measures for inspection work as soon as possible and provide effective guarantees so that countries that abide by the regulations are protected and not harmed by other countries that violate the regulations. These guarantees include controlling atomic energy and limiting and reducing armaments. (6) An international agency should be established immediately to implement the various measures passed for reducing and controlling armaments. (7) The General Assembly should urge the Security Council to expedite the arrival of the date for receiving the armed forces of various countries, and urge member states to withdraw their troops stationed on the territories of former enemy countries in a balanced and progressive manner, and to withdraw their troops stationed on the territories of other United Nations member states as soon as possible upon obtaining the permission of the countries concerned, as clearly stipulated in various conditions or agreements. (8) The various provisions included in the current resolution shall not change the resolution passed by the General Assembly on January 21, 1946, when the Atomic Energy Commission was established. (9) The General Assembly should call on all member states of the United Nations to provide the Security Council and the Atomic Energy Commission with all possible assistance in order to establish and maintain international peace and security.</p>
<h3>Veto Issue: Australian Motion Passed</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 13th] The General Assembly today passed the motion of the Australian representative, which urged the permanent members of the Security Council to avoid hindering the rapid and effective work of the Security Council when exercising their veto power. The motion was passed by a vote of 36 to 6, with 11 abstentions. China also abstained. Before the vote, Gu Weijun stated that the Chinese government currently opposes making any amendments to the Charter. If a plan can be found that is acceptable to all member states of the Security Council, the Chinese government is prepared to endorse it, but this time has not yet come.</p>
<h3>UN Trusteeship to Begin Spring Next Year</h3>
<p>[Report] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast Flusing News: The United Nations Trusteeship, established following the League of Nations mandate system, will begin in the spring of next year. United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie is preparing to convene a ten-nation conference in Paper in February next year in order to determine the steps for implementing the United Nations trusteeship, promoting the economic and moral standards of the governed peoples, in preparation for implementing autonomy and joining the community of nations in the world. Since the United Nations has already passed eight draft trusteeship agreements, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and France, as the governing authorities, are naturally members of the Trusteeship Council.

The United Nations Trusteeship Committee may therefore be established on December 14. In addition to the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, China, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand, two other countries will be elected to participate in the committee.

<h3>Cuba Suggests Return of Envoys to Poland, Yugoslavia, and Romania; Countries Withdraw Diplomatic Personnel from Spain</h3>
<p>[Report] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast The Cuban representative issued a statement today suggesting that United Nations members withdraw their envoys stationed in Poland, Yugoslavia, and Romania.

A statement was issued after the meeting, saying that this resolution will make the majority of countries feel regret in the short term, because this measure has seriously violated the fundamental principles of the Charter.</p>
<h3>UN's Next Year Budget: China to Bear Six Percent</h3>

<p>[Reuters, Athens, 13th] It is announced here that the Greek government has presented notes to the representatives of the Four Powers in Athens tonight, protesting the Allied nations' rejection of Greece's request for adjusting the Greek-Albanian border.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Distribution Method: Compromise Solution Reached</h3>
<p>Six Hundred Million Yuan Worth of Supplies Still Awaiting Transport</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] Regarding the distribution of the $626,000,000 worth of UNRRA relief goods that have not yet been shipped, the United States and the Soviet Union have differing opinions. The U.S. representative, Wood, argued that due to changing circumstances, relief goods allocated to Country A could be rerouted to Country B. The Soviet representative, Vinogradov, insisted that the distribution should follow the original decision made several months ago and should not be changed. After several days of dispute, the UNRRA's 48-nation representative conference finally passed a compromise proposal, stipulating that the issue of such rerouting could be handled by the UNRRA's nine-nation Central Committee at its discretion. The current session of the UNRRA Representative Conference can therefore be adjourned.</p>
<h3>Jinnah's Speech in England: Insists on Partition of India; Says Muslim League Will Convene its Own Constituent Assembly; Britain Has Not Abandoned Hope of Mediating the Indian-Muslim Dispute</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] New Delhi, 14th Broadcast: Jinnah received reporters today, stating that the Indian Muslim League will convene its own constituent assembly. It is claimed that the only solution to the Indian problem is the partition of India, with Muslims and Hindus each drafting their own constitution, holding their own meetings, and not invading each other. This is the only shortcut to solving the complex problem of India.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] The leader of the Indian Muslim League, Jinnah, gave a broadcast speech tonight, stating that if the current tragedy within India is not overcome, and if the British government continues its current policy, the result will inevitably force India into a civil war, thereby causing repercussions throughout the world. The current situation in India is extremely dangerous. Hindus and Muslims are two different nations, clearly different in all aspects. Therefore, the only solution is to divide India into Pakistan and Hindustan. The sooner Britain expresses its support for the partition of India, the more opportunities there will be to avoid a terrible catastrophe.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] Regarding the attitude that Britain will adopt towards the Indian problem in the future, according to well-informed sources here, the British Cabinet currently has two different viewpoints on this matter. It is heard that Prime Minister Attlee, Defense Minister Alexander, and Trade Minister Cripps all advocate adopting a compromise attitude. On the other hand, the Secretary of State for India, Lord Lawrence, and people in the India Office and the War Office believe that Britain should continue to occupy India until a satisfactory agreement is reached between the Muslims and Hindus. The last hope for Britain to mediate the Indian-Muslim dispute depends on the Viceroy of India, Wavell, and Lord Halifax, because Halifax and the Indian Mahatma Gandhi have a very close personal relationship, which is widely known. The Saudi Arabian delegation visiting the United States, on the right is Foreign Minister Faisal. (Special dispatch from the New York Times)</p>
<h3>A Great Undertaking of 1946: U.S. Navy's Antarctic Expedition; Long Journey, Extreme Cold; Perilous Winds and Waves, Unprecedented</h3>
<p>[United Press, aboard the USS Mount Olympus en route to Little America, 15th] The U.S. Navy's Antarctic expedition's submarine, the USS Sennet, will, upon arriving in Antarctica, submerge under the ice and fire at the ice layers of the Ross Sea, and launch two torpedoes to see what the results are. According to the submarine's captain, Eisenhower, the ice floe will not be damaged in any way. The submarine has ten officers and seventy crew members, all of whom volunteered to participate in this expedition. The length of the underwater voyage, the coldness of the climate, and the danger of the winds and waves will be the most experienced by the USS Sennet. The submarine will take the opportunity to measure the ocean floor and collect marine microorganism specimens at the same time. In addition, there are 42 special cameras and film that can be used to take 34,000 pictures. In addition, the film for taking color pictures can also be used to take 12,000 pictures. There are a total of 50 photographers, most of whom are from the Navy, and some from the Army and Marine Corps. Mapping the Antarctic will be done from three aspects. Two groups of ships will circumnavigate Antarctica, each group supplied by Navy aircraft. The two groups of ships will send out ten aircraft to inspect the inland. Some aircraft can penetrate 700 miles inland. Another third group will send aircraft from the Little America ice airfield deep into the Antarctic hinterland. Therefore, the areas it passes through will be those that have never been discovered or mapped by predecessors. The aerial camera has three lenses, which can shoot vertically and can simultaneously capture a very large area at two oblique angles. The problem is whether the weather and the voyage will be as desired. If there are 15 to 20 days of good weather during the two months of the expedition for aerial photography, it will be considered fortunate.</p>
<p>[United Press, aboard the USS Mount Olympus en route to Little America, 13th] The U.S. Navy-sponsored Antarctic expedition will take four months, and will film the situation in various places at any time. It is hoped that 60 percent of the Antarctic region can be captured on film. If the weather is good, experienced aerial photographers will take a full view of this frozen area. The area is as large as the United States. After the photographs are taken, a part of the area that we could not see with our naked eyes before will be vividly displayed before our eyes. At the same time, a part of the secrets under the Antarctic ice and snow will also be drawn into the picture. The 68th Mobile Unit is responsible for this mapping work. The director of the Antarctic expedition film is Schellere, who has twice explored Antarctica and has rich photography experience. Aerial photographers have a total of 82 aerial cameras and 61 miles of aerial photography film, which can take 500,000 pictures. There are a total of 54 moving picture cameras, carrying 104 miles of film. The temperature may be as low as minus 60 degrees. Each photographer carries two cameras, in case one freezes. There are almost no routes or signs to follow, only relying on latitude and longitude instructions. Pilots have been specially trained. If everything goes smoothly, an accurate Antarctic terrain can be measured, which may provide clues as to where minerals are buried. Schellere first tried to explore Antarctica in 1928. He is very enthusiastic about this re-exploration. The supervisor will be Quake Bush, who supervised the production of atomic bomb tests. Quake is currently the Chief of Staff of Navy Rear Admiral Croson.</p>
<h3>Truman Meets with Saudi Foreign Minister to Discuss the Pakistan Dispute; Arab League Asks Britain to Lift Ban on Muslim Leader</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] President Truman today discussed the Palestine dispute with Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Faisal. Faisal told reporters afterward that the Palestine issue was mentioned during the discussion, but only in general discussions of other common interests of both parties, and no details were involved. The Saudi Arabian government opposes President Truman's plan to allow a large number of Jews to immigrate to Palestine.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 13th] According to a statement today by Jamil Husseini, acting chairman of the Palestine Arab Executive Committee: The Arab League has passed a resolution authorizing the League Secretariat to request the British government to lift all bans on the exiled Mufti of Jerusalem, Jamil Husseini, and allow him to return to Palestine immediately. The Muslim leader secretly fled from Paris two months ago and has been under the protection of King Farouk of Egypt.</p>
<h3>Painless Childbirth: New Method Invented; Not Applicable to First-Time Mothers</h3>
<p>[United Press, Philadelphia, 13th] Miles, a 34-year-old associate professor of obstetrics at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, recently reported at a press conference a new method of "completely painless childbirth," which uses a needle to inject "Pitocin," a derivative of the pituitary gland (sella turcica), to stimulate labor, combined with continuous spinal anesthesia (i.e., partial anesthesia by injecting anesthetic through a catheter). It is said that injecting "Pitocin" can activate the longitudinal muscles on the uterus, thereby promoting childbirth. The mother is conscious during childbirth. In the 63 trials conducted over two days, no one died. The longest labor time was four hours, and the shortest was only 35 minutes. However, this method cannot be used for first-time mothers because their uterine foundation has not yet grown. This new method is especially beneficial for mothers suffering from tuberculosis, diabetes, and heart disease.</p>
<h3>Iranian Troops Advancing at Full Speed: Completely Occupy the Capital of Azerbaijan; General Kabitari, Commander of Azerbaijan, Arrested; Soviet Union Asks Iranian Army to Stop Advancing</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Special Correspondent, London, 14th] Although the Iranian issue has eased due to the surrender of the Azerbaijan army, the situation has become tense again today. According to news telegrams from Tehran received here, Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Sakchikov, has requested the King of Iran to immediately stop the advance of the Iranian government army in Azerbaijan, on the grounds that this advance may "cause disputes on the Soviet border." The King of Iran immediately replied that the Iranian army's advance would definitely not cause disputes, because the Azerbaijan militia has surrendered and its leaders have fled. According to the latest report: Iranian government troops have occupied the airport a few miles away from the city of Tabriz. When the weather turns better, government aircraft can begin to operate.

<h3>"Werewolf" Appears in French Normandy Countryside at Night</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] In the three villages of Placy-Guéhebert and Roucamps in Normandy, a strange person has appeared every night for six days, shooting randomly in the villages with a Thompson gun. Villagers call him "Werewolf." Last night, the "Werewolf" wandered the streets of Roucamps for four hours, shooting at the windows of houses along the street. The police and farmers have not yet seen the person's true face. Doctors believe that the person has a nervous breakdown at a fixed time, and has a homicidal appetite, but at other times he is no different from ordinary people. Therefore, he may be mixed among the villagers when he is not having a nervous breakdown, and will search for himself together with others. Therefore, the villagers are suspicious of each other.</p>

<h3>Blum Cabinet Expected to be Formed; Communist Party Proposes Conditions for Participation; Two Major Parties in the House of Representatives are Equally Matched; Increased Issue of Francs May Lead to Further Devaluation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] The new Prime Minister Blum told the press that he hopes that the new French cabinet can be organized tomorrow night. He has achieved major achievements in his talks with the leaders of various parties. The Radical Socialist Party has expressed its willingness to participate in the government. In short, he will do his best to strengthen the cabinet formation work. He hopes that the new cabinet can be formed tomorrow, which is especially urgent for everyone.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] The Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a communiqué tonight, stating the conditions for the party to join the coalition government, stating that it must first review Prime Minister Blum's proposals and measures before it can decide whether to participate or not. Furthermore, conservative parties must not participate in the coalition government. Reliable sources said that the Communist Party's intention is to obtain "one of the three key positions of foreign affairs, national defense, and internal affairs. [Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] The National Assembly met today and decided that when the National Assembly presents the list of members to the Senate of the Republic on Tuesday, the Communist Party and the People's Republican Movement will occupy an equal number of seats. Of the senators elected by the National Assembly, a total of 50 seats, 42 of which will be allocated to various political parties, with the Communist Party and the People's Republican Movement each occupying 12 seats. After the results of the elections in various overseas regions are revealed, the number of seats occupied by the two major political parties will be roughly equal, that is, the Communist Party has 73 seats, the People's Republican Movement has 74 seats, the Socialist Party ranks third with 45 seats, and the Radical Socialist Party has 28 seats. The total number of senators is 315, so there are still 51 seats to be elected by overseas regional parliaments. However, due to various environmental difficulties, the Senate will be established before the aforementioned 51 members are elected.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] Although Blum's new government has not yet been formed, some people have already called it the government to rescue the franc. Although the French Ministry of Finance has repeatedly denied that the franc will be devalued again, the Bank of France's weekly report shows that the amount of francs issued has exceeded 700 billion francs. At the same time, the rapid rise in prices and the repeated demands of various unions for wage increases all indicate that the franc is actually rapidly devaluing. Some financial commentators estimate that the French government's budget deficit has reached a huge 400 billion francs, and the continued expansion of currency cannot be stopped without taking strong austerity measures.</p>

<h3>A Central Air Transport Corporation Passenger Plane: Suddenly Disappears En Route from Beijing to Shanghai; Carrying Several Boxes of Banknotes Shipped from Beiping to Shanghai; Only Two Passengers Besides the Flight Crew</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] A passenger plane of the Central Air Transport Corporation suddenly disappeared yesterday afternoon around 2 p.m. The whereabouts of the plane have not been determined as of 2 a.m. this morning. It is reported that a C-47 type No. 31 aircraft of the Central Air Transport Corporation flew from Beiping to Shanghai the day before yesterday. When passing through Nanjing, it stopped at Nanjing Ming Palace Airport overnight due to bad weather. The plane was loaded with several boxes of banknotes shipped from Beiping to Shanghai, and carried two passengers in Beijing. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., the No. 31 aircraft was piloted by pilot Ma, co-pilot Zhang, and radio operator Zhong, and took off from Beijing to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 2:45 p.m. yesterday. However, after takeoff, the plane lost radio contact with the Beijing and Shanghai air stations. Its whereabouts have been unknown since then, and there has been no clue until late at night. Later, it was learned from the person in charge of the Central Air Transport Corporation's flight team: 30 minutes after the plane took off from Beijing, another Central Air Transport Corporation plane received a radio message from the No. 31 aircraft en route to Shanghai, but it did not see its whereabouts or destination. As for whether the plane had an accident on the way and was forced to land, it has not yet been determined as of late at night. In addition to the three flight crew members Ma, Zhang, and Zhong, the No. 31 aircraft only carried two passengers who boarded in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Interruption of Sino-American Airmail; Post Office Explains Doubts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, Sino-American airmail has suddenly been interrupted. Since mid-October, the American side has not received any airmail from China. As a result, overseas Chinese and business people in America have been calling to inquire, causing widespread concern. Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Wang Yuguang, Assistant Manager of the Shanghai Postal Administration, to inquire about the cause of the airmail interruption. It is said that the delivery of airmail between China and the United States has always been handled via the Manila Post Office. From Shanghai to Manila, it is transported by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes, and from Manila to San Francisco, it is transported by Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) planes. Currently, CNAC's Shanghai-Philippines flights are operating as usual, so airmail is still being continuously transported to Manila. Therefore, the interruption is due to delays in Manila. It is rumored that the reason is the suspension of Pan Am flights, but the exact details are unknown. The Shanghai Post Office sent a letter to inquire two weeks ago, but has not yet received a reply. A telegram was sent on the 12th to follow up, and the truth will be announced as soon as a response is received. As for a remedy, there is only one air route between China and the United States, so there is currently no solution, and everything depends on the situation in Manila.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Preventing Mail Theft</p>
<p>The reporter further inquired about recent rumors of unscrupulous individuals stealing mail from mailboxes, opening and reading the contents, and then defrauding the senders or recipients. Mr. Wang believes this is not the case. Not long ago, news reported this, and said that dozens of thieves had been caught, but the postal authorities immediately made detailed inquiries with the Garrison Headquarters and learned that this was not the case. To his knowledge, there was only one instance where a thief stole some letters from a mailbag while a postman was delivering mail in order to commit fraud. After the case was solved, postmen were ordered to pay more attention in the future. Mr. Wang continued that ten years ago, the style of mailboxes in this city was larger at the top and smaller at the bottom, so letters often piled up at the top, allowing people to use hooks to steal stamps. This was discovered and the design was changed to the current style. Of course, the theft of letters cannot be absolutely guaranteed to be non-existent now, but the loss of many letters is also due to the forgetfulness of the sender or the negligence of servants. Therefore, if citizens do find that their letters have been opened and they have been defrauded as a result, they can report the details, and the post office will do its best to investigate and prevent it.</p>
<p>Regulations of Two Airlines on Types of Valuables for Air Transport</p>
<p>In the past, the regulations of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation on the transport of ordinary goods versus valuables were not uniform, which inevitably led to misunderstandings. After consultation between the authorities of the two companies, the types of valuables were determined, and will be implemented simultaneously by the head office and branch offices in various places from today. The names of the air-transported valuables are as follows: (1) Radio vacuum tubes. (2) Silk. (3) Finished glass products. (4) Light bulbs. (5) Porcelain. (6) Cameras. (7) Gold. (8) Banknotes. (9) Certified securities (government bonds). (10) Pearls. (11) Antiques. (12) Jade. (13) Diamonds. (14) Watches. (15) Silverware. (16) Fountain pens. (17) Silver. (18) Ivory. (19) White fungus.

(40) Glycerin. (41) Straw hats. (42) Gems. All items other than those listed above are considered ordinary cargo. The freight rates for ordinary goods and valuables will remain the same as before.</p>

<h3>Five Trade Associations Call on the Council to Improve Tax Collection According to Law for the 34th Year Profit Tax</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Western Cuisine and Coffee Industry Association, the Shanghai Drama Industry Association, the Shanghai Ballroom Industry Association, the Shanghai Hotel Industry Association, and the Shanghai Restaurant Industry Association jointly requested the City Council to forward a letter to the Direct Taxation Bureau for the profit tax of the 34th year, to improve the collection according to the tax law. It stated: "Upon investigation, the members of our associations have all conscientiously followed the instructions of the authorities and truthfully declared the net profit obtained from the annual turnover, after deducting various expenses. However, upon receiving the payment notice from the Direct Taxation Bureau, the amount to be paid was calculated based on the annual net profit, exhausting all income, and then increasing it by 50 percent, which caused surprise. At the end of the year, once a business is settled and there is a surplus, shareholder dividends and employee bonuses must be allocated. If the surplus is taxed further, no one will bear the responsibility for the loss incurred, and the business will inevitably be forced into bankruptcy or closure. Our associations are aware of the difficulties of the times, and we hope that you will consider our request and forward a letter to the Direct Taxation Bureau to promptly improve the tax collection in accordance with the tax law, so as to alleviate the hardships of businesses and comply with reason and law, which is beneficial to the public."</p>
<p>Ballrooms Request Free Tea</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Ballroom Business Association recently appealed to the City Council for tax reduction, stating that the heavy taxes are unbearable. The four reasons are: (1) Entertainment tax has already been paid when purchasing dance tickets. Drinks are not entertainment and should not be taxed. The double taxation is detrimental to business. (2) In various theaters in the city, in addition to the tax on the tickets, there is no tax on tea, but ballrooms must pay taxes on tea, which is unfair. (3) Gasoline and beer have already paid factory tax when they leave the factory, and retail sales are not taxed separately according to law. Moreover, the wine and tea industries have already been exempted from taxes, while dance halls still have to pay taxes, which is obviously inconsistent with the law. (4) The collection of taxes on drinks in dance halls was a harsh tax during the enemy and puppet period. Now that the victory has been achieved for many years, it should be removed to alleviate the difficulties of businesses.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telephone Company's Skyscraper; Location Selected at "Xingzong" Site; New European Machines Arrive in Shanghai in January</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] There are many rumors about the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company building a tall new building, and the company is keeping it a secret. According to reporters, the new building of the Shanghai Telephone Company will be built on the site of the "Xingzong" near Fuzhou Road and Fourth Road. The site was originally enemy property and is an ideal location. The relocation of the telephone company is subject to the restrictions of the lines. It cannot be moved at will. The location is at the "center of the line", which is suitable for both the telephone company and telephone users. The Shanghai Telephone Company has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to purchase the property, and it is reported that the Executive Yuan's reply has arrived in Shanghai, indicating its agreement. Liu Gongyun, director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, has also agreed to sell the site to the Shanghai Telephone Company, and the specific details are still being negotiated. Once the work of the "Xingzong" is completed, the telephone company will begin construction of the new building, which will be at least fifteen stories high. The new machines ordered by the Shanghai Telephone Company from the United States will be placed in the new building. The old machines at the original site on Jiangxi Road will also be moved to the new building, but most of them will be discarded. As for the Shanghai Telephone Company building on Jiangxi Road, it will be auctioned off. In addition: The new telephone machines ordered by the company from Europe will arrive in Shanghai in January next year. The new machines will be installed in the Shanghai Telephone Company on Fujian Road. At that time, the telephone panic in the city may be alleviated. Fang's confession, Gu has never left Shanghai, proving the bank signature and checkbook has never left Shanghai, in accordance with the law, surrender must be in person, so the judgment on May 9, 34th year, there are doubts, the High Court's decision to exempt him from punishment is inappropriate, so it has been requested to the Supreme Court on the previous day for retrial, please be returned for retrial. According to Gu, since the High Court's judgment, he has left Shanghai and fled to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Truth About Embezzlement by Xingzong Machinery Factory Staff Disclosed; Eleven Suspects Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The deputy director of the Xingzong Zhenru Machinery Assembly Factory, an Australian named Xizhi, colluded with senior factory staff to embezzle and sell twenty boxes of aluminum sheets and fifty-five boxes of plywood worth more than 100 million yuan. After being reported by factory staff members such as Zhu Jiade, the General Office notified the Police Headquarters and requested the arrest and investigation of the relevant suspects. In mid-month, the Police Bureau arrested Yang Shenghuan (34 years old, Hunan), the factory's dispatch director, Li Luoshi (21 years old, Guangdong), the assistant yard supervisor, Ma Shiyi (21 years old, Hebei), a shipping department employee, Qian Zhengfu (23 years old, Jiading), the distribution group director, Xie Boluo (34 years old, Polish), the factory affairs director, Cao Chiming (36 years old, Zhejiang), a shipping department checker, and other six people in Xianyang Road 70 Alley 84, Meibaike Road 97 Alley 16, the same lane number 14, North Zhongzheng Road 102 Alley 21, and inside the Zhenru factory; And three recipients of stolen goods, Zhang Wuqing (owner of Hongkang Hardware Store, 168 Xinzha Road), Li Siheng (owner of Jingcheng Hardware Store, 211 Xinzha Road), and Huang Zhangbin (architect of Daxing Company, Room 303, Continental Building, 113 Jiujiang Road). In addition, Le Gang, a would-be extortionist, was arrested at 9 Hao, 401 Alley, Changle Road. He was a "Lian Zong" inspector, and after individual interrogations revealed that the principal was Deputy Factory Director Xi Zhi, the "Xing Zong" inspectors Hui Desen and Deng Tuolai arrested Bu at 165 Maiyang Road. After questioning by a U.S. attorney of "Lian Zong" and the Australian Consulate, it was confirmed, and the person was officially handed over to the Police Bureau on the 2nd of this month for joint handling. Due to the complexity of the case, the investigation was not completed until the day before yesterday, and the case was transferred to the District Attorney's Office for investigation. Now we explore and record the results of the police investigation as follows: Regarding the theft of aluminum sheets, (1) At the end of October of this year, Xi Zhi applied to the General Office for the allocation of ten boxes of aluminum sheets on behalf of the need for a new factory. He obtained the warehouse receipt in early November, but did not immediately deliver it to the new factory. Instead, he colluded with Qian Zhengfu, the distribution group director, to resell it to Wang Xiansheng, the owner of the Sino-American Oil Company. Qian received a reward of one million yuan. (2) On November 12 of this year, Yang Shenghuan, the factory's dispatch director, learned that Xi Zhi had applied for a warehouse receipt for ten boxes of lead sheets, so he jointly discussed with Li Luoshi, the field surveillance assistant, and obtained the consent of Xie Boluo, the factory affairs director, and Xi Zhi. After changing the warehouse receipt to a pick-up voucher, it was resold to Jingcheng Hardware Store in Xinzha Road for 11 million yuan. When Jingcheng sent someone to pick up the goods, they were stopped by Chen Chuanyao, the ticket checker and manager, because the lead sheets had been picked up by Wang Xiansheng. At that time, Xie and Li falsely claimed that this was another batch of goods, and the formal warehouse receipt was now with the deputy factory director, so the ten boxes of lead sheets in the factory were successfully stolen. Half of the stolen money was converted into 920 U.S. dollars. Except that Xi Zhi received 420 U.S. dollars and 5,000 legal tender, and Li Luoshi received 500 U.S. dollars, the rest was divided equally, and Chen Chuandeng also received a share. Regarding</p>
<p>The theft of plywood occurred on July 25, when Huang Zhangbin, an architect of Daxing Company, contacted Xi Zhi to purchase 55 boxes of plywood stored in the factory. Twenty-five boxes were transported to Guofu Road in Nanjing, and 30 boxes were transported to 586 Tangshan Road in this city. The payment was 11,000 U.S. dollars, as evidenced by a receipt signed and stamped by Xi Zhi. As for the attempted extortionist Le Gang, an inspector of "Lian Zong," he learned that Xi Zhi had stolen public property, and on the 21st of last month, he used the identity of a "Xing Zong" secret agent to threaten Xi and Xie to demand 20 million yuan, otherwise he would report to the General Office for handling according to law. Later, for safety reasons, Xie Boluo wanted to settle the matter with 10 million yuan, and just as he was about to pay, the incident was revealed and he was arrested by the police. A total of 20 lead sheets, 500 U.S. dollars, 2.2 million legal tender, and many other documents were seized.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is actively planning to expand overseas routes. It previously dispatched the Hai Xia to launch the China-Philippines route.

<p>Also, the Bureau recently sent the Hai Lie to launch the China-Thailand line, sailing between Shanghai and Bangkok. The ship was repaired at the He Zong Factory and left the dock at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Three small ships were dispatched to tow it, but due to the bad weather, there was some wind and waves at that time, making the work difficult. Therefore, although the ship had left the dock, there were minor problems, and the public was not aware of the details. In addition to the aforementioned China-Philippines and China-Thailand routes, the Bureau will also send the "Hai Tian", "Hai Di", "Hai Xuan", "Hai Huang", "Hai Zi", "Hai Chen", "Hai Su", and "Hai Zhang" and some landing craft to Japan, Korea, and various islands affiliated with Japan to transport surplus materials. Although the above ships have been sailing for a long time, the nationality certificates from the Ministry of Communications have not yet been issued. Ships currently sailing on international routes urgently need nationality certificates. The Bureau sent Fan Lun, director of the Maritime Section of the Shipping Department, to Beijing the day before yesterday to request the Ministry of Communications to issue them. It is heard that Fan will bring the nationality certificate of the Hai Lie back to Shanghai on Monday because it is urgently needed to launch the voyage to Siam.</p>

<h3>Taking Advantage of Low Water Season in Winter to Promote River Dredging; Public Works Bureau Settles on Concrete Measures; First Phase of River Dredging to Include Six Rivers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Public Works Bureau has decided to take advantage of the low water season in winter to actively promote river dredging. Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, specially convened the heads of various work zones of the bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss implementation measures. The meeting was chaired by the Director General, and attended by Zhu Guoxi, Director of the Engineering and Structure Department of the bureau, Qian Weifan, Civil Affairs Commissioner, Zhang Xingmin, representative of the Civil Affairs Department, Sun Yongyi, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, and the heads of various work zones. Concrete decisions have already been made.</p>
<p>The City's Rivers are Divided into Four Categories</p>
<p>The Shanghai River Dredging Regulations divide the city's rivers into four categories: (1) First-Class Trunk Rivers, (2) Second-Class Trunk Rivers, (3) First-Class Tributary Rivers, and (4) Second-Class Tributary Rivers. The funding for river dredging is determined according to their categories as follows: (1) Dredging costs for first-class trunk rivers are borne by the municipal treasury. If it involves neighboring counties, the city and the neighboring counties share the responsibility. (2) Dredging costs for second-class trunk rivers are borne by the municipal treasury. When necessary, the benefiting areas may be ordered to raise supplementary funds, not exceeding 50% of the total dredging costs. (3) Dredging costs for first- and second-class tributary rivers are entirely borne by the benefiting areas, but in special circumstances, a subsidy may be requested from the municipal government, with a minimum of 40% of the total costs.</p>
<p>Surveying Work Completed</p>
<p>The city's first-class trunk rivers are three: the Huangpu River, the Suzhou Creek, and the Zaojiaobang. It is currently impossible to start dredging them. Yesterday's meeting decided that the first phase of dredging will include six rivers, including the Zoumatang in Jiangwan and the Puhuitang in Longhua, which are second-class trunk rivers. The Shajinggang from Hongkou to Jiangwan, the Taoshupu from Dachang to Rugao, and the Dutai River and Majiabang in Pudong are first-class tributary rivers.</p>
<p>The surveying work for the above rivers has been completed. The first step in the dredging work is to establish river dredging committees in each district, with the head of the work zone serving as the chairman, and representatives of the district's residents and local gentry serving as committee members. The number of committee members is set at 15 to 17, and the organization must be completed by the 25th of this month. The detailed organizational rules have been submitted to the Municipal Council for resolution.</p>
<p>Recruitment of Labor; Allocation of Flour</p>
<p>Due to the tight municipal finances, the estimated budget for the first phase of dredging the six rivers this year will not exceed 300 million yuan. According to estimates by experts from the Public Works Bureau, this project will require 800,000 workdays and the removal of 400,000 cubic feet of sludge. The following methods for recruiting labor have been decided: (1) When recruiting labor, all male residents in the relevant areas between the ages of 20 and 45 are obligated to participate. Citizens who participate in the work will receive flour from the Executive Yuan, at a rate of two catties per person per day. (2) In accordance with the Labor Service Law of the Ministry of the Interior, those who do not wish to work may hire someone to replace them, and the flour from the Executive Yuan will be received by the substitute worker. (3) Those who participate in river dredging will receive wages from the municipal government and flour from the Executive Yuan. The above three methods will be carefully considered by the bureau before a final decision is made.</p>

<h3>Mediation of Labor-Management Disputes - Working Environment Needs Improvement - Small Room, Many People, Loud Arguments - Very Similar to "Having Tea and Talking"</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] The Mediation Section of the Social Bureau convened a departmental meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday to review the experience of mediating labor-management disputes and to seek technical improvements. In past mediation work, the following difficulties were often encountered: (1) During the mediation of disputes, the employer's representatives often deliberately failed to attend, preventing the work from being completed quickly. (2) During the mediation process, some workers had an uncooperative attitude, making it difficult for the mediators to handle. (3) The room was small, and there were many people. The room was noisy during mediation, and the order was chaotic. Most people held cigarettes and argued loudly, a situation very similar to "having tea and talking." From the reporter's personal observation: all the mediators were able to be patient and calm, fulfilling their responsibilities and demonstrating commendable service. However, the working environment must be improved.</p>
<p>Lead-Printing Workers Get a Daily Wage Increase of 4.5 Jiao</p>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] The basic wage of lead-printing workers in this city was originally 35 to 45 yuan. Because they could not maintain their livelihood, they requested an adjustment in their pay.

A settlement record was established at the Social Bureau yesterday.</p>
<h3>Cause of Arsenal Explosion - Not Believed to Be Due to Any Malicious Intent - Fugitives to Be Placed on Wanted List</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] The results of joint interrogations of transportation soldiers, warehouse soldiers, and wounded soldiers in the Jiangwan arsenal explosion case, conducted over several days by Director Yang of the Ordnance Department, Director Ling of the Ministry of National Defense, Commissioner Lei, Commander Fu of the First Supply Zone, and Director Yan of the Garrison Headquarters, still suggest that the cause of the accident was not due to any malicious intent. The testimony of all the interrogated soldiers was largely the same, stating that after they had finished unloading the grenades that day, they had boarded the truck to prepare to leave. At that time, only the escort squad leader from the Zhejiang Hongying Bureau and one guard soldier were left in the warehouse when a sudden explosion was heard, and they hastily fled for their lives. The fact that there were two bodies next to the truck lent credence to this account. As for the missing Deputy Warehouse Chief Wang Renxian and storekeeper Wu Rubiao, it is not believed that they had any other conspiracy, as they were both old employees with reliable backgrounds and years of service, and neither of their families had disappeared. Therefore, it is likely that they fled in fear of punishment, and the authorities will place them on the wanted list. Excavation is continuing at the site of the accident, and no new discoveries have been made. After a roll call of the Supply Zone soldiers, it is now known that two soldiers remain missing and their fate is unknown.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation - Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Meddling</p>
<p>Cao Yuqun asks: My girlfriend, Miss Jia, is thirty-five years old and unmarried. A month ago, her father asked her for a private seal, and the next day, an engagement announcement bearing her name and that of Mr. Yi was published in the newspaper. Because she did not give her prior consent, she naturally cannot recognize this engagement. Please advise: (1) If Miss Jia does not deny it, will it be considered tacit consent, according to the law? (2) What is the deadline and method for denial? (3) Is it legal for Miss Jia to get engaged to Mr. Bing herself? Will Mr. Bing be guilty of interfering with a family? (4) Does the current law require parental consent for engagement, and how many people must participate in the ceremony? (5) Is it legal if a lawyer certifies it?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui answers] (1) If Miss Jia does not deny it, it will naturally be considered consent; (2) There is no regulation; (3) According to Article 972 of the Civil Code, marriage should be determined by the man and woman themselves. If Miss Jia is an adult and engages herself to Mr. Bing, it is of course legal, and Mr. Bing does not constitute interference with a family; (4) According to Article 975 of the Civil Code, the engagement of unmarried men and women who are not of age should have the consent of their legal representative. There are no regulations regarding the ceremony; (5) Yes.</p>
<p>(2) House Rent Increase</p>
<p>Zhang Shenchao asks: My family lives in Pudong. Eighteen years ago, due to trouble in the clan, my late father moved out of the ancestral house and rented a house to live in, and had a lease agreement with landlord Mr. Jia. Later, the war broke out, and my late father could not bear the burden of the rent, and wanted to move back to the old house to live in. At that time, landlord Mr. Jia happened to be fleeing and was not home to take care of the house, so they discussed reducing the rent in exchange for taking care of the house. In May of the 33rd year of the Republic, my late father passed away. The landlord suddenly expressed an intention to increase the rent, claiming that starting from this year, the monthly rent would be five dou of rice. I am unable to bear this burden. I specifically want to know what to do legally. [Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui answers] The standard for rent increase should be determined according to the circumstances of each locality. In this case, it is better to negotiate with the lessor, otherwise, request a ruling from the local court.</p>

<h3>Production Loans - Conditions Can Be Relaxed - To Allow Production to Recover - Talk by Mr. Huo Baoshu of the Loan Review Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] Yesterday, our reporter interviewed Mr. Huo Baoshu, the newly appointed chairman of the Provisional Review Committee for Production Academic Loans, and asked him about various issues related to production loans. He answered the questions in detail. The main points are as follows: The government's purpose in launching production loans this time is to address the current pathological state of industry and mining enterprises, providing emergency treatment to allow production enterprises to recover. Therefore, loans will focus on reducing production costs to facilitate production and sales. The committee has drafted a preliminary plan of principles for loan applications to be followed when applying for loans. In the future, after the draft is approved, any factory that applies for a loan and meets the requirements of the principles will be eligible to apply. He hopes that every applicant will make as much use as possible of its own inherent strength and not rely solely on loan assistance. At the same time, after obtaining a loan, they should not waste their inherent strength on matters outside their own business scope. According to his research, Chinese factories in general should actively improve their management systems. In terms of production costs, the current high interest rates account for a much larger percentage of the total labor costs than before the war. Therefore, high interest rates are one of the reasons for the sharp rise in production costs after the war. Factories that obtain loans and are able to reduce production costs by repaying old debts with the loan should also be considered. Therefore, the rigid requirement that past loans must be secured by raw materials and finished products may also be relaxed. The application method for this loan may be individual applications from each factory. After approval, each factory can entrust its original commercial banks and firms to carry the goods and allow the banks and firms to handle the transfer of mortgages with the Central Bank at any time. However, this does not conflict with the organization of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial loan syndicates. As for the various regulations on loans, he said that he would make full use of existing conventions and make necessary improvements. At the same time, the Loan Review Committee will hold three meetings a week, which will help to shorten the time from application to issuance of loans, which is believed to be shorter than before. As for the total amount of loans, it is still being finalized, depending on the actual needs of each factory, and efforts will be made to supply them. However, he sincerely hopes that the loan proceeds will be fully used for production purposes.</p>
<p>In addition, Deputy Secretary-General Diao Minren of the Joint Treasury stated to reporters: Production loans are intended to support legitimate production enterprises. Therefore, those who obtain loans should make full use of the loans for production purposes and should not divert them to other uses. We are now waiting for the Loan Review Committee to convene a meeting next Monday to decide on the direction of progress. He said that loan applications submitted to the Joint Treasury in the past will also be submitted to the Review Committee for centralized processing. The loan interest rate will be slightly flexible depending on the situation of each factory, but the maximum will not exceed five points.</p>
<p>It is heard that the Provisional Review Committee for Production Loans will publicly invite the Taishi press next Monday after convening a meeting to report on the committee's future work direction.</p>
<h3>Rumors Subside - Gold, US Dollars, and Stocks Fall Together - Gold Price Falls to 3.1 Million - US Dollars Fall Below 6,000 Yuan - All Stocks Experience a Decline</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] Yesterday, as reported in the news that the International Monetary Fund will accept exchange rates from member countries next week, still based on official rates, people's hopes were slightly dampened. In addition, the Central Bank suppressed the prices, causing them to fall back. The opening price in the morning was still around 3.27 million, but it was forced to retreat after opening, and many people closed their positions to take profits, retreating to within 3.2 million. However, there were still some buyers, and it soon rose back to the opening line. The Central Bank then distributed 100 bars at a price of 3.25 million, which started the downward trend. In addition, the Central Bank controlled the market, and buyers' psychology wavered. The selling trend strengthened, and after 10:00 AM, the Central Bank retreated again. Near noon, it broke into the 3.1 million mark, and the price gradually stabilized after seeing a low price of 3.08 million. At noon, it struggled above 3.13 million.

The high price did not exceed 1,400 yuan, and the low price was only 1,320 yuan. In the end, it hovered between 1,350 yuan and 1,370 yuan. As a result, it closed 50 yuan lower than the previous day. The B Bonds rose by 20 yuan, the D Bonds rose by 30 yuan, and the E Bonds were flat. The volume was over 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks plunged sharply as most of the large yarn and flower houses came out to take profits. Near noon, small investors were miserably crushed. Xinyi and Daitong then followed Match and announced their limit down. The opening price in the morning was still above the previous closing price, but the opening of Diyong Yarn was extremely chaotic. It was difficult to decide on a price between 570 yuan and 590 yuan, so 580 yuan was used to discount the market price as the opening price. After the opening, No. 212 made great efforts to raise the price. In the extreme chaos, Diyong Yarn was raised again to over 600 yuan. Numbers 151, 197, and 232 sold at high prices, and the price fell back quickly. Numbers 212, 76, 44, 83, 91, 115, and 91 all advanced and still easily rebounded. However, the 600 yuan mark was difficult to cross after that. Numbers 36, 223, 151, 145, 76, 89, and 109 all sold. After 10:20 AM, it began to decline, but there was a lot of struggle. From 10:30 AM, the gold market plunged, and people's hearts turned. Numbers 152, 61, 224, 22, 107, and 76 all sold, and the decline became more intense. Match and Daitong were the first to hit their limit down. In addition, Numbers 229 and 198 vigorously sold Diyong Yarn. The market situation gradually went downstream in a daze. Near noon, small investors were miserably crushed. Numbers 229, 198, and 152 desperately sought No. 212, who suddenly came to sell. People's hearts were greatly shaken, and Xinyi also announced its limit down. The two Yong Yarn stocks both broke into the 500 yuan mark at the same time. The noon closing was slightly sideways.

<h3>The Central Bank Reiterates Its Gold Policy - Hoping People Will Not Easily Believe Rumors and Suffer</h3>
<p>The Central Bank recently stated that the gold allocation is still being supplied in large quantities. The surge in prices in this city is actually caused by speculators who are creating trouble. The official side is still handling it according to the established policy and there has been no change at all. This kind of artificial influence will first strike speculators, secondly, the public will rush to buy and will also suffer, and thirdly, it will affect general commercial banks. Therefore, it is hoped that the general public will recognize that all rumors deliberately creating trouble are deliberately created by speculators and will not bring trouble upon themselves.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Soybean Cake are Shipped to Taiwan - Many Cigarettes are Also Shipped to Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] A large batch of soybean cake was shipped to Taiwan. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyu Wheel sailed to Keelung the day before yesterday, carrying 20,870+ pieces of soybean cake, 1,510+ pieces of soybeans, 158 pieces of cotton yarn, and 500 pieces of piece goods.

<h3>Overseas Remittances Decreased Again Last Month - Smugglers Buy Up Large Amounts</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] According to estimates by relevant sources, the number of overseas remittances in November decreased again compared to October. The main reasons are: (1) The black market price of US dollars has soared, while the official price remains the same; (2) The number of smuggling activities in South China has not decreased. Today, there are often remittances from one place in the United States to another, mailed to Guangdong, and sold to smugglers at a price slightly lower than the black market price of US dollars. The official estimate of the monthly loss is as high as 10 million US dollars. According to statistics from the Bank of China, in the six months after the victory last year, monthly overseas remittances were as high as 5 million US dollars. Today, the situation has changed, and monthly remittances are only about 2 million US dollars, and there is a trend of decrease, which is worrying. It is also rumored that foreign banks in Hong Kong are attracting overseas remittances from China at high interest rates. The reporter asked a banking expert about this, who said it was untrue. Because the vast majority of remittances sent to South China are for family use and support, rather than for investment or speculation. In the past, a certain national bank established a branch in Guangzhou, intending to attract overseas remittances with higher interest rates, but the results were very unsatisfactory, which is proof of this.</p>
<h3>Japonica and Glutinous Rice Prices Rise - Miscellaneous Japonica and Soybean Cake Sell Well and are Expensive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market had a total of over 11,000 shih of goods arriving from the north and south. Each shop had goods in stock, so the market gradually prospered. Southern japonica rose sharply by 131,000 yuan, and northern japonica also continued to increase by more than 2,000 yuan. Indica rice followed with an increase of 3,000 yuan. As the White Yuan Winter Solstice is approaching, sales are becoming more active, and it rebounded by 23,000 yuan. Yin Yuan jumped by 34,000 yuan. Flour prices are rising secretly because of high prices in the interior and fewer arrivals. Bran also rose by 200 yuan, but sales are quite small. Soybean transactions are lively, and prices have risen by 3500 to 1,000 yuan. Broad beans remain stable. Red beans still lack rise and fall. Sesame seeds are scarce and showy. Cantonese are continuing to purchase, and the price has increased by 12,000 yuan. Raw peanuts are still active at high prices, while medium and low prices are still stagnant. The situation is still in a spiral. Soybean cake has transactions in Huitou, Taiwan, and Fujian, and prices are rising step by step, rising by 3400 yuan. The oil market supply and demand are still balanced, and there is little volatility. Raw oil was weak early in the day and firm in the afternoon, and the result was stable. High-quality soybean oil rose slightly by 12,000 yuan, while medium and low quality was fair. Sesame oil stores are fragrant and dry, and the price rose by 34,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Overseas Branches are Densely Located, Mainly Dealing with Overseas Remittances</h3>
<p>[Also Reported] According to a reporter's investigation, the Bank of China's overseas branches, which mainly deal with overseas remittances, are distributed as follows: Four branches are located in New York, London, Singapore, and Hong Kong. There are thirteen sub-branches, two of which belong to the New York branch, located in Cuba and suburban New York City. One sub-branch belongs to the London branch, located in Liverpool. The Singapore branch has four sub-branches, located in Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Batavia, and Sydney. The Hong Kong branch has six sub-branches, located in Calcutta, Mumbai, Karachi, Yangon, Saigon, and Haiphong. The main business of each branch and sub-branch is primarily dealing with overseas remittances, followed by import and export industries. During the anti-Japanese war, those who were not occupied were committed to promoting government bonds.</p>
<h3>Loan for Industry and Commerce: Release of Funds Begins; Total Amount 16 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>The lending measures for the electrical machinery and silk weaving industries have been approved by the Four Banks Joint Treasury. The Bank of Communications and the Bank of China will begin lending on November 25th. The silk industry has already completed the loan application procedures and signed contracts with the two banks. According to the Four Banks Joint Treasury's approval, the loan amount is 3 million yuan per electrical machine. Only factories with ten or more machines can apply for loans from the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China, while those with fewer than ten machines can apply for loans from the Industrial and Commercial Loan Syndicate. There are more than 300 silk weaving factories with ten or more machines, totaling 5,500 machines, with a total loan amount of 16 billion yuan. The collateral for the silk weaving industry is raw materials and finished products, with finished products not exceeding 50%. The discount is calculated at 70% of the market price.</p>
<h3>Difficulty in Importing American Orders</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The issue of handling orders placed in the United States before November 17th has not yet been resolved. According to reliable sources, the quantity of these goods, including those already shipped and those with contracts already signed, is very large. If import is permitted, the Central Bank will have to provide a large amount of foreign exchange. Due to the significant implications, the matter has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for instructions. Furthermore, due to the large number of applicants and the lack of manpower in the Import Control Committee, delays are inevitable. It is also understood that the nature of these goods is very complex. For example, a major American radio company signed a contract with a Chinese company for the latter to sell 20,000 radios, but only 1,000 have been shipped to date. However, in the import regulations, radios are included in the list of quota imports, making it difficult to apply for import permits. It is reported that some goods with high import priority have already had their permits telexed and are awaiting completion of the relevant procedures.</p>
<h3>Business Community Seeks Lenient Treatment from the Government</h3>
<p>As for the opinions of the importers, they believe that the government's move was not known to the business community in advance, so the orders did not meet the government's requirements. The fault does not lie with the merchants, so they hope that the government will grant special lenient treatment and allow import, especially for goods that have already arrived at the docks, so that they can be moved into warehouses immediately to avoid unnecessary losses.</p>
<h3>Developing Home Industries: City Bank Provides Loans; Over 140 Million Yuan Already Loaned Out</h3>
<p>In order to assist the development of small-scale home industries in the city, the Shanghai City Bank specially began providing home industry loans in September of this year, with a total amount of 200 million yuan. Those with a fixed location and handicraft equipment, operating a normal small-scale home industry, and have joined the trade association can apply for a loan from the bank. The monthly interest rate is 5%, and the term is temporarily set at six months. The original maximum limit per household was 2 million yuan in national currency, but the Ministry of Finance stipulated that the maximum amount for small industrial and commercial loans should not exceed 500,000 yuan. Therefore, from October onwards, the maximum loan amount was revised to 500,000 yuan. As for collateral, in addition to using the industrial equipment as collateral, one or two reputable manufacturers must also be found as guarantors. It is also stipulated that each household is limited to one loan and cannot change its name to obtain multiple loans. It is learned that the applicants for this loan include those in the handmade cotton weaving industry, towel and blanket industry, wooden box industry, soap and candle industry, and weights and measures industry. As of now, the bank has loaned out a total of 140 million yuan, of which 75 million yuan is said to be still in the process of completing the guarantee and signing the contract.</p>
<h3>Industry and Commerce Guidance Office: Allocates Coal and Iron</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs convened representatives from the city's machine foundry industry yesterday afternoon for a symposium. The representatives elaborated on the current difficulties of the industry. It is reported that the office, in order to supply various raw materials and fuels to private factories, has shipped some Anshan pig iron and Beipiao coal to Shanghai. Anshan No. 1 pig iron costs 880,000 yuan per ton, No. 2 costs 850,000 yuan per ton, and Beipiao coal costs 6.1 million yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Bounced Check Problem: Account Holders Abuse Checks; Increasing Month by Month; Statistics of Bounced Checks for the Last Six Months</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Negotiable instruments are originally a symbol of credit, and their circulation and use depend entirely on credit. However, the number and amount of bounced checks at the city's clearing house have been increasing month by month. This also shows the extent to which general bank account holders in the city are abusing credit. Although the banking industry has recently issued measures to crack down on bounced checks, the trend of bounced checks has not diminished. According to a person in the banking industry, the economic downturn in the city's industrial and commercial circles is one of the reasons for the bounced checks. However, in recent years, newly established banks and firms, in order to attract business, often allow customers to open accounts with low deposits and even offer gifts to increase customer interest, all of which are sufficient to increase the number of bounced checks. The following is an excerpt of the total number of bounced checks and the total amount for each month in the city's clearing house for the last six months:</p>
<p>Month Number of Checks Amount</p>
<p>June 47,334 86,095,699,217.03</p>
<p>July 77,853 134,110,082,694.61</p>
<p>August 68,911 121,274,101,457.55</p>
<p>September 96,204 161,489,029,057.98</p>
<p>October 103,86 162,547,935,318.52</p>

<h3>National Silk Export Problem: Special Export Committee to be Formed; Government Provides Affordable Raw Silk and Rayon; and Bears Part of the Funding for Weaving Machines</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The problem of large-scale export of national silk was discussed by silk weaving industry representatives and Director Lin Fengbao of the Central Bank. A decision in principle has been made, and the details will be discussed tomorrow. It is planned that the Central Bank, the Central Trust of China, and the China Silk Corporation will jointly form a special export committee.</p>
<p>Silk Weaving Factories to Form a Company</p>
<p>The silk weaving factories will be responsible for forming a company. The government will provide affordable raw silk and rayon. The government will bear 100,000 to 200,000 yuan per weaving machine. The government's supply price of raw silk will be higher than the level of US$6.5 per dan, and the supply price of rayon per case will be far below 2.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>Three-Month Manufacturing Plan</p>
<p>The manufacturing plan will be in three-month periods. In the first period, it is planned to weave 78,500 pieces of silk, using 1,450 dan of raw silk and 2,300 cases of rayon. It is estimated that the foreign exchange earnings from exporting the finished products will be more than double that of exporting raw silk. The government hopes that the company can be responsible for its own profits and losses, but the silk weaving industry hopes that the government can provide assistance. This is the problem that remains to be solved. The inaugural meeting of the company has been scheduled for today.</p>

<h3>China to Organize Special Education Group to Lecture Throughout Japan and Guide Overseas Chinese to Love the Country and Obey the Law</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] According to a recent survey by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Chinese delegation to Japan reports that there are currently more than 29,200 overseas Chinese in Japan, of which 60% are Taiwanese who have been repatriated, totaling 18,000. Half of them were forcibly recruited from Taiwan to work in Japan during the war. After Japan surrendered in August last year, in addition to those sent back to Taiwan, there are still those who live in various parts of Japan and refuse to be sent back. Most of these people are young people around the age of 20, with complex backgrounds and bad habits. The delegation believes that although these young people and other Taiwanese residing in Japan have considerable assets and considerable knowledge and skills, they are very isolated from the situation in the motherland after 50 years of Japanese rule and should be guided to develop a spirit of loving the country and obeying the law. When Mr. Zhang Yuejun went to the United States and passed through Tokyo, he suggested that domestic educational institutions should be responsible for hiring 30 to 40 educational experts to organize a special education group to travel around Japan to give lectures for a period of three months. It is estimated that it can be successfully completed in about one year. The delegation believes that this suggestion is very valuable, as it can improve the status of overseas Chinese in Japan and build a bridge for good Sino-Japanese relations in the future. This suggestion has been forwarded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Ministry of Education for comments. It is reported that the Ministry of Education is considering it. It also advocates that the education group should be expanded and that specialists should be selected from various ministries and commissions and relevant agencies, and that prominent figures from the community should be invited to participate.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Recently Formulated University Guidance System: Guidance Departments to Continue to Exist</h3>

The main task of the guidance committee is to legislate regulations related to guidance, which will be formulated by the committee. The guidance department will be responsible for the implementation.

It is reported that the Ministry of Education has decided on the following allocation methods: (1) 600 radios for social education institutions and secondary schools in various provinces and cities (social education institutions pay half the cost, secondary schools pay the full cost). (2) 42 radios for education departments in various provinces and cities, full cost. (3) 11 radios for national social education institutions, half cost. (4) 12 radios for science museums in various provinces and cities, half cost.

<h3>Qingdao in a State of Hibernation – The Continued Existence of "Confiscation" and Warfare – Damages Qingdao's Industry, Commerce, and Culture</h3>
<p>— Eleventh Day Airmail News Report – Our Newspaper's Qingdao Special Correspondent Hang Zhou</p>
<p>The sea breeze howls, and sand flies about. Qingdao, the "summer resort," is already in a state of hibernation. This winter is colder than ever before. Since the victory against Japan, Li Xianliang, who fought guerrillas in Laoshan, led his troops to take over the city, and it has been under siege by the Communist army ever since. In winter, the source of coal, which is essential for the lives of the people of the north, is very scarce. Although traces of this black stuff can still be found in the market, the price of more than 300,000 yuan per ton can only be a decoration in magnificent mansions, and ordinary citizens have no such blessing. On December 8, after a night of fierce winds, more than 200 of the 80,000 refugees fainted from cold and starvation. This is just a "small" tragedy, leaving an indelible stain on beautiful Qingdao, which should be the many ugly dramas performed by the "receivers." Guo Zhongkui, head of the Lu Yu Jin District Receiving and Investigation Team, made the following statement: "Qingdao's receiving corruption is the worst in the country!"</p>
<h3>Visiting Mayor Li, He Says: It's Hard to be in Charge</h3>
<p>Li Xianliang is the current mayor of Qingdao. Before the Anti-Japanese War, he was the director of the Qingdao Special City Party Headquarters. During the guerrilla warfare in Laoshan, he served as acting mayor. In that era, he worked hard. He shared the joys and sorrows with all the comrades who fought guerrillas, risking their lives. After the victory, he was officially appointed as the mayor of Qingdao, took his luggage and took office. Now, he lives in the luxurious former Japanese consulate. After the reporter arrived in Qingdao, he went to visit him. I was received in an exquisite reception room. The sofas and spring chairs were covered in solid-colored blue velvet, pleasing to the eye. The gentle warmth and colorful curtains separated the frozen world outside. Mayor Li was wearing a spring outfit and talked about some issues with a smile. That day happened to be the day that US House Naval Committee member Isaac and five others left Qingdao for Tianjin. He first talked about the reception of foreign guests, saying: "Qingdao is an international city, and just the reception of foreign guests is enough to take up my mind. Foreigners pay great attention to the first impression. If you use Chinese food to entertain them, you must leave them with a very beautiful impression of Chinese flavor. Therefore, the freshness of the dishes and wine, and the exquisiteness of the cups and plates, are extremely important." He mentioned the banquet hosted by the Central Naval Training Group for the US congressmen last night: "They were obviously the first time they tasted Chinese flavor and praised it loudly, but I still feel a little uncomfortable today after drinking those wines."</p>
<p>The reporter said: "It is indeed not easy for Mayor Li to maintain the situation in Qingdao in the past year!"</p>
<p>He smiled very gracefully: "But some people who don't understand me are attacking me fiercely. Things in China are often like this: it's hard to be in charge! For example, about the reception, some of my subordinates have done wrong things, and it's all counted on my head!" Because of this matter, he made a special trip to Nanjing, and after returning, he inspected various places, seeming to have the determination to actively rectify the municipal administration. But he said to others with emotion: "Everyone under my hand has relationships, who should I deal with?"</p>
<h3>Qingdao's Receiving Corruption is the Worst in the Country – But Only Eight Cases Have Been Transferred to the Court</h3>
<p>A few days later, I met Mr. Jiang Kexun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, in the reception room of the Municipal Government. He criticized Mr. Guo's remarks as follows: "There are two questions here: First, what is the extent of national corruption and receiving fraud? Second, what is the extent of Qingdao's receiving fraud? Mr. Guo did not really handle the national receiving investigation, so it is difficult to make a comparison. Furthermore, since Qingdao's receiving fraud is the worst in the country, but only eight receiving fraud cases have been transferred to the court..." The implication seemed to be that it did not quite match the four words "worst in the country." Regarding these eight cases, I made a special trip to the local court to inquire, and five of them have already been prosecuted, and three are still under close investigation.</p>
<p>The targets of the five prosecuted cases are: (1) Li Dawu, Section Chief of the First Printing and Dyeing Factory of the China Textile Qingdao Branch, and clerk Xu Yanpei. (2) Lu Guangen, member of the Qingdao Municipal Government and Director-Secretary of the Public Business Management Committee, and Wang Zijing, a member of the committee. (3) Zhu Xiancai, receiving commissioner of the Economic Department's special commissioner office. (4) Guan Jinghai, clerk of the Real Estate Group of the Central Trust Bureau. (5) Ma Xijun, member of the Qingdao City Party Committee and member of the Party and Government Receiving Committee. The targets of the three cases still under investigation are: (1) Zhang Leigu, member of the National Senate. (2) Qiu Ruiji, member of the City Party Committee. (3) Sun Zhenyou, an employee of the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Most of the Involved in Corruption Cases are Lower-Level People</p>
<p>Among them, the most sensational is the case of Zhang Leigu. In the mouths of ordinary citizens, Zhang Leigu is: "One of the three giants of Qingdao's receiving." There are many rumors about his "stealing dogs and changing days" tactics. He is now detained in the local court and is not allowed to meet any guests. The court seems to be particularly serious in handling this case. Chief Prosecutor Ding Shuke told reporters: "The big one can be prosecuted in two weeks."</p>
<p>"I don't think Director Guo said that casually." When the reporter interviewed Yang Changdi, Dean of the Second Branch of the Shandong Higher Court, and mentioned the certainty of Guo Zhongkui's remarks, Yang said: "As for those who commit corruption, most of them are probably middle and lower-level people. I didn't see what the receiving situation was like in Qingdao at the time, but what I know is that most of the personnel used at the time were "taken locally." If the superiors do not strictly prevent and stop the occurrence of corruption, or even tacitly allow it, the situation will be out of control." He then talked about the corruption of the previous political atmosphere: "The environment often forces the creation of corrupt phenomena. In a prosperous city like Qingdao, if officials don't take cars, don't wear suits and leather shoes, and don't have various luxurious enjoyment, it seems that they can't see people and are considered useless. When many people already have that kind of enjoyment, it is almost impossible for a few people to avoid it and want to change." He had just returned from Jinan, and he said that Jinan was much simpler than Qingdao, so the receiving situation in Jinan was also better. He also said: "There are only two types of officials now: one is an actor, and the other is someone with other purposes. There is no third type. Like a judge's income in the court, it is only enough for a family to eat cornbread. These people are all actors. We can only maintain it with personal feelings. Otherwise, a judge who goes out to hang a sign as a lawyer, the income from accepting a case is enough to exceed a year's salary as a judge." During the week that the reporter came to Qingdao, in order to find a house, he discovered some of the city's "secrets" regarding housing issues. I can almost say this: "Qingdao's handling of enemy and puppet housing is also the first in China"! In Shanghai, I know that there have been some "powerful" people illegally occupying houses, but it has always been considered illegal. However, in Qingdao, all occupiers are recognized, which invisibly encourages the atmosphere of occupation. An official from the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau said it well: "As long as the people living in the house pay the rent, the government will have income, who lives there? It's the same anyway." As a result, one person in Qingdao occupies more than a dozen houses, and at the same time, many people can't find a place to live. "Housing shortage"! "Housing shortage"! The parrot with a crooked mouth is calling like this. There is a Housing Assessment and Allocation Committee, which is an institution to deal with applicants, but it is famous in name only. There is still no clear list in the committee, and whether those houses have been processed or those houses have been processed is like a riddle. One gentleman finally got allocated a house, but someone was already living there. When he asked them to "move," they stretched out their hands and said, "Bring money"! As a result, this gentleman who couldn't afford the "moving fee" had to live in a hotel.</p>
<p>The Most Dangerous Period Has Passed – Vigilance Has Not Been Relaxed</p>
<p>The most dangerous period for Qingdao militarily has passed. The most dangerous time was this summer. At that time, the Communist army had attacked Qingdao's water source, and the city's military strength was weak and in jeopardy, but the Communist army did not dare to take advantage of the situation. Liao Zhipan, Deputy Commander of the Second Appeasement District of the Xuzhou Appeasement Office and Commander of the Qingdao Garrison, commanded some security teams and struggled to overcome this crisis. Now, the periphery is gradually expanding. The Jiaoji Railway is a major artery in Shandong. With the railway bureau's rush repairs, traffic can be restored. Once this road is open, Qingdao's state of being blocked can be declared lifted.</p>
<p>However, the Communist army, which has abandoned peace talks, is preparing new military actions. On both sides of the Jiaoji Railway, especially in the southern region, with Linyi as the center, a considerable number of Communist troops are gathered, and they may launch a double-strike against the cities along the Jiaoji Line at any time, in order to expand their military division. Xia Chuzhong, Commander-in-Chief of the 20th Army Group, who is responsible for the security of the Jiaoji Line, came to Qingdao a few days ago and said to reporters: "The National Army abides by the ceasefire order and will never take the initiative to attack, but if the Communist army invades me, then I will definitely have a way to deal with it." Therefore, as far as Qingdao is concerned, it is still in a state of vigilance and fear at this moment. "Sudden checks on household registrations" are often held. In addition to the midnight curfew that has already been implemented, a maritime curfew has also been implemented since December 5, prohibiting all civilian ships from entering and leaving.</p>
<p>The Conscription Quota is 1,000 – To Be Completed Within the Year</p>
<p>The conscription quota for Qingdao this year is 1,000. Due to various unexpected reasons, only more than 600 have been conscripted so far. Conscription is carried out in accordance with the central laws and regulations. The mayor draws 1,000 names from the number of eligible young men in the city. Fearing that there would be incidents of evasion, the baojia chiefs took ropes to the homes of each drawn young man on the night the list was announced and told them: "You should fulfill your most glorious duty!" Naturally, there was some disturbance. And the illegal phenomenon of some baojia chiefs taking the opportunity to buy and sell top alleys has also been frequently discovered in Qingdao. It is said that the remaining 300 or so who have not yet been conscripted will be completed within this year.</p>
<p>Nine Out of Ten Public and Private Factories Have Not Yet Resumed Operations</p>
<p>The continued existence of "confiscation" and warfare is a great harm to Qingdao's industry, commerce, and culture. According to statistics, there were more than 4,000 public and private factories of all sizes in Qingdao during the enemy and puppet period, but less than one-tenth of them have resumed operations. And the market situation is even more bleak. Most of the goods come from Shanghai, plus a considerable freight fee. How can the small citizens, whose income is lower than that of Shanghai, afford to buy them, except for those who make a fortune by "confiscating" and some special people? In the streets, you can see that the paint on the facades of large and small stores has faded, just as desolate as the fallen leaves in front of them!</p>
<p>Qingdao Only Has a Beautiful Exterior – Like a "Flexible Daughter"</p>
<p>Surrounded by the sea on three sides and mountains on one side, Qingdao only has its beautiful appearance. Someone once said: "There is no culture here." When you walk into a bookstore, all the books come from Shanghai, and 90% of these books are of a yellow nature. No decent magazine is published locally. The content of the several daily newspapers that represent culture is poor and boring. The "special dispatches" of some newspapers are completely copied from Shanghai newspapers, word for word.</p>
<p>I walked alone on the coast of the Yellow Sea, quietly passing by those bathing beaches. I came to the Qianhai Boardwalk at the end of Zhongshan Road. I stood and watched, the sea breeze howling and the waves surging. This is known as one of the best naval bases in the Far East, but China's new navy is still in its infancy. At this moment, American sailors are going ashore in batches, and jeeps are speeding through the deserted asphalt roads. Dance halls, bars, and cafes are only lively during the time when American sailors go ashore. Girls in strange clothes are hugging one sailor after another. So, I thought of giving Qingdao an appropriate adjective, calling it: a "flexible daughter"! (December 11, on a freezing night in Qingdao)</p>
<h3>The Great Tainan Earthquake: A Brief Account of Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>— Airmail Dispatch from the 9th, by our Correspondent in Taiwan, Yang Yu</p>
<p>At 6:45 AM on the 5th of this month, a violent earthquake occurred in Sinhua and Yongkang, approximately eight kilometers northeast of Tainan City. The maximum amplitude exceeded one centimeter, with the overall tremor lasting for ten minutes. The perceived duration for people was over a minute. In an instant, houses collapsed, railways and bridges were destroyed, and more than three hundred and seventy people were killed or injured, all due to being crushed by collapsing buildings. Heartbreaking cries filled the air, resembling a scene of hell on earth!</p>
<p>The epicenter was a triangular area encompassing Yongkang, Xinshi, and Sinhua, with Sinhua being the most severely affected. In the epicenter area, the ground suddenly cracked open in several places, with the land either rising or sinking by as much as two meters. Nearby roads, sugarcane fields, and peanut farms saw dozens of places where black sand and spring water erupted, with the longest stretch reaching twenty kilometers.</p>
<p>The railway between Tainan City and Sinhua suffered significant damage. Of the total length of eleven kilometers, eight kilometers were severely impacted by the earthquake, with rails being bent or broken. Simultaneously, two railway bridges were cracked, disrupting traffic. After emergency repairs by railway workers, and because the line was a double track, trains were able to pass through normally by 5:00 PM that evening. The main water supply line for Tainan City (buried between Xinshi and Sinhua) was also cracked in four places due to the earthquake, causing a water outage in Tainan City. Repairs are expected to take a week. Fortunately, the Jianan Irrigation System was undamaged, so there was no impact on agricultural irrigation, which is a blessing amidst misfortune. In recent days, provincial authorities have dispatched personnel to the disaster area to investigate the situation in detail, provide instructions on relief efforts, distribute supplies, and comfort the affected people. The Taiwan branch of the National Relief Commission has also sent doctors with medicine to the disaster areas to treat the injured.</p>
<p>The most severe earthquake in Taiwan occurred on the morning of the 21st of the Republic of China, at 10:02 AM, in the Hsinchu and Taichung area, resulting in 15,001 deaths and injuries, and 55,000 collapsed houses. The second most severe earthquake occurred on the morning of December 17th, 1930, at 4:19 AM, in Chiayi, resulting in 1,002 deaths and injuries, and over 15,000 collapsed houses. In addition to significant landslides, the severity of this Tainan earthquake can be said to be second only to these two major earthquakes.</p>
<h3>The Difficult Journey of Miss Cotton</h3>
<p>— Airmail Dispatch from Zhengzhou on the 6th, by our Correspondent in Zhengzhou, Fan Shiqin</p>
<p>Why was Zhengzhou a famous commercial port before the war? I've lived in Zhengzhou for a year and haven't figured it out. Is it because the magnificent Lunghai Garden was bombed into ruins? Is it because the section of the Pinghan Railway going north was leveled by the "Road Demolition Army"? Is it because the Huayuankou breach hasn't been filled yet? Or has some bigwig passed away? Or has some Red Little Group grown old? I still haven't found an answer. Recently, because I needed to add a cotton quilt, I had to pay attention to cotton. So, I often asked the cotton merchants at the stalls and the cotton transporters on the carts, and then I realized how important cotton is to Zhengzhou, and that there is a Zhengzhou only when there is Miss Cotton.</p>
<p>All Sectors are Busy for Cotton</p>
<p>A few days ago, cotton in Zhengzhou was 2,500 yuan per catty, but it has now risen to 3,000 yuan. It is said that recently is the time when cotton is coming on the market, and some big merchants from Shanghai have already arrived in Zhengzhou to purchase cotton. Trains are busy transporting cotton and medicine, and banks are busy handling cotton mortgage exchanges. The transportation and financial sectors of a market are all busy for this cotton. This cotton is becoming popular in this market. Anyang is a cotton-producing area. Some time ago, 70% of the cotton-producing area was in the hands of the Communist army, but recently those areas have been recovered. It is said that Anyang produces 300,000 dan of cotton this year. During the War of Resistance, we were in northern Hubei. The largest production in northern Hubei was cotton. At that time, except for the occupied areas, the first place in cotton production in the country was the Northwest, and the first place in the Northwest was northern Hubei. The Ministry of Economic Affairs set up many institutions to absorb the cotton of northern Hubei, and many officials and merchants became rich and successful because of this. In fact, the entire cotton production of northern Hubei was less than 300,000 dan. So, it is surprising that Anyang alone produces 300,000 dan of cotton. When the Communist army occupied the vicinity of Anyang, people were still under their control, and cotton was no exception. At that time, they only paid 50 or 60 yuan of "Anti-Japanese Currency" to buy a catty of cotton from the people, saying that the people were willing to let the cotton rot on the ground, betting on a year of hard work that was not compensated. After those cotton-producing areas were recovered, the price of cotton in Anyang suddenly fell from 2,000 yuan per catty to 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Merchants' Business Acumen</p>
<p>Now, some cotton merchants are flocking to Anyang to purchase cotton, this is business acumen. Business acumen is one thing, and making money is another. According to those cotton merchants, you must bring cash to Anyang to purchase cotton, because there is no bank in Anyang, so you must have some adventurous spirit. Cotton merchants regard cotton as business acumen, while the local authorities in Anyang regard cotton merchants as business acumen. An additional levy of more than one million yuan is imposed on a car of cotton worth 40 million yuan. An Anyang cotton packing factory is only ten miles away from the Communist army and has no way to start work, so a carload that can carry 30 tons can only carry 16 tons of cotton. At the same time, because the packaging is not tight, 2% will leak on the way, and it is necessary to pay 150,000 yuan for insurance per car. In the past, 10,000 yuan of capital could buy 30 tons of cotton, but now 200,000 yuan can only buy 165 catties. Therefore, now if you want to dare to buy 30 tons of cotton, you need more than 73 million yuan, and ordinary merchants do not have such a large amount of funds. So, purchasing cotton in Anyang is also not an easy business.</p>
<p>A Surge in the Market</p>
<p>However, the Zhengzhou market is stimulated by cotton. Several banks and money shops are doing a lot of cotton mortgage exchanges. Most of the cotton coming from Anyang is transported to Hankou. A cotton household can apply for a mortgage exchange of 300 million yuan at the Bank of Communications in Zhengzhou. The interest rate is 4.5%, but the term is only 15 days. When it arrives in Hankou, you can apply for another mortgage exchange. The interest rate is 5%. If there is a factory in Hankou, the term can be extended to 45 days. This is a preferential treatment for manufacturers. Currently, only 100,000 dan of cotton passes through Zhengzhou, which is still far from the 3 million dan of cotton that passed through before the war. These 100,000 dan of cotton have stimulated the Zhengzhou market into a surge. If 3 million dan of cotton poured in like before the war, then Zhengzhou would become a veritable commercial port. "There is a Zhengzhou only when there is Miss Cotton" is indeed a well-deserved reputation.</p>
<p>China Textile Company Buys Cotton</p>
<p>The China Textile Company recently purchased 300,000 dan of cotton in the Northwest, but because it cannot get on the trains of the Longhai Railway, it is still stranded in Xi'an and often has "difficult cotton." Although someone is purchasing cotton in the Lingbao area, how to get it here is still a problem. The difficulty of Miss Cotton's journey is not only about getting on the train, but also because there is no packing lady (packing factory) to dress her up. Originally, there were six packing ladies in Henan. One packing lady in Anyang is in the situation mentioned above and is not working. The two packing ladies in Lingbao have no way to dress her up because Miss Cotton's arrival is uncertain. The remaining three packing ladies are in Zhengzhou. Two were taken away by the enemy, and one was taken over by a troop to be used as a flour grinder. They are now requesting the Ministry of National Defense to return it, which is probably no problem.</p>
<p>To restore the Zhengzhou market, we must first restore the Zhengzhou cotton market, and make it have 3 million dan of cotton gathered in Zhengzhou like before the war. Of course, there are many difficulties. The main reason is that the cotton fields have been reduced a lot because the enemy controlled cotton in the past. In the past year or so, it is naturally impossible to recover all at once. Yu Feng and Shenxin Yarn Factory have decided to resume production here, but it cannot be completed in a short time. The factory buildings must be rebuilt, and the machines are probably still in the United States. In addition, there are many problems with transportation. However, everyone is looking forward to Zhengzhou returning to its pre-war prosperity, so they are looking forward to Miss Cotton coming to Zhengzhou to revitalize the market.</p>

<h3>The Third New Film from China Electric Company, "Distant Love"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chen</p>
<p>After the screening of "Family of Loyalty" and "Horror in the World", China Electric Company’s Second Studio now presents us with its third film, "Distant Love". The subject matter of this film is very realistic, and its theme is: to portray an ideal housewife who, under the influence of reality, steps into society.</p>
<p>Synopsis: Professor Xiao Yuanxi's speech at the Youth Hall angered his lover, Zhu Manli, leading to their break-up. He then vowed to create an ideal wife. That evening, Xiao suddenly noticed that the maid, A Zhen, was secretly reading a book. He decided to use A Zhen as the subject of his experiment, teaching her daily about social skills, attitude, and etiquette. A Zhen's knowledge and insights improved rapidly. When the January 28th Incident of the Shanghai War broke out, A Zhen joined the nursing corps because her father and brothers were brutally murdered by Japanese invaders, and served wounded soldiers fighting against Japan. One day, Zhen happened to be walking with Li Lianqun, which Xiao witnessed, greatly displeasing him. He instructed A Zhen not to continue this work, which left Zhen feeling disappointed. By the eve of the July 7th Incident, Xiao became even more vigilant in preventing Zhen from participating in anti-Japanese activities. However, the full-scale outbreak of the August 13th War moved Zhen deeply, and she resolutely went out to participate in the war effort. Coincidentally, Xiao was invited by a friend to leave Shanghai for Hankou. As the National Army retreated westward, he telegraphed Zhen, urging her to come to Hankou. Zhen then left her eldest child with Wu Yanan, took her youngest child, and left Shanghai on a refugee ship. Unexpectedly, the ship was bombed mid-journey, and her youngest child died tragically. This only strengthened Zhen's resolve to resist Japan. Xiao met Zhen and saw that she had become a soldier, which displeased him greatly, while Zhen was also disgusted with Xiao's decadent lifestyle. At that time, a female soldier named A Tang came to visit, and Zhen accompanied her to the war zone service troupe. Hearing this, Xiao wanted to bring Zhen back, but Zhen refused, leading to a final break-up. When Wuhan was abandoned, Xiao met Wu Yanan and learned that Zhen had joined the service troupe led by Li Lianqun. When Guilin was evacuated, Xiao met Wu again and went to the service troupe to find Zhen. Xiao pleaded for a renewed relationship, but Zhen said she would answer after the victory. After the victory, Zhen originally intended to reunite with Xiao, but suddenly realized Xiao's mistakes, leading to a heated debate. Zhen then left Xiao. Xiao ended up marrying Zhu Manli, and during the wedding he said that Zhen, after being transformed, had surpassed even himself.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the plot is quite compact. The director of this film, Chen Liting, is known as a theoretical expert. Now that he has successfully filmed this work as he wished, the result can be foreseen. I happened to meet director Chen Liting at the Second Studio of "China Electric" a few days ago. I learned that the scene of the retreat from Guilin in the film was filmed in Wuxi, and more than 10,000 temporary extras were hired. This scene alone should have a "cherry on top" feel.</p>
<p>Now, this film will soon be screened at the "Imperial Palace". Only public opinion will be able to judge its success!</p>
<h3>Zhao Dan in "Distant Love"</h3>
<h3>On the Rise and Fall of Kun Opera</h3>
<p>— Xuan Lu</p>
<p>Kun Opera takes its name from its place of origin. However, it is not a type of local opera like Sichuan Opera, Chu Opera, Yue Opera, or Shanghai Opera. At the same time, the Kunqu music used to perform Kun Opera is also not a type of local music.</p>
<p>Our country's rhyming literature transformed from the Book of Songs to the Chu Ci, then to the Han and Wei yuefu, then to Tang poetry, and then to Song ci. Ci is a variant of poetry, so it is also called "poetry surplus." Song ci evolved into Yuan qu, which is actually a variant of ci, so qu is also called "ci surplus." Therefore, from the perspective of our country's literary history, qu inherits the essence of poetry and serves as the precursor to modern vernacular poetry and prose.</p>
<p>From a dramatic perspective, although there were canjunxi plays in the Tang Dynasty, their content is impossible to verify. Poetry and ci are works in which authors express personal emotions, and there is never an example of speaking on behalf of others. Qu, on the other hand, is a representative form, with arias and dialogue. Each play is divided into several acts and can be performed on the stage, making it a work of art enjoyed by the masses. Therefore, qu is the earliest form of drama in our country, and all later forms of drama originate from it.</p>
<p>However, although the qu lyrics of Yuan qu are still available today (for example, Zang Jinsu's Yuanqu Xuan is the easiest book to purchase), its musical tune has been lost. The Kunqu music that is passed down today is not the same as the old Yuan qu. However, it is closer to the ancient music, and the proper sounds of refined music still exist. The origin of Kunqu is described as follows:</p>
<p>Succeeding the Yuan was the Zhu Ming Dynasty. Since the Ming Dynasty restored the homeland with the Han people, expelled the Hu Yuan, and the literary and artistic aspects also changed the simple and straightforward style of the Yuan Dynasty, and admired rhetoric. However, the system of qu has become deeply rooted, and although the Ming people wanted to restore ancient ways, they could not get rid of its stereotypes. Thus, qu was divided into northern and southern styles. Zaju is called Northern Qu, and its system mostly imitates the works of Yuan people, with simple and unadorned words and vigorous rhythms. Chuanqi is called Southern Qu, and Gao Zecheng's Pipa Ji pioneered it. In the early Ming Dynasty, Jing Liu Bai Sha was written, and later authors created a magnificent view. Its style changed from the simple and straightforward style of the Yuan Dynasty to a beautiful and elegant style, and its rhythms were slow and gentle, which was the characteristic of a prosperous age.</p>
<p>However, whether it is Northern Qu or Southern Qu, if it is not accompanied by music, it is only a literary work, and has nothing to do with qu at all, let alone being called drama. Since it is called qu, it can not only be broadcast with wind and string instruments, but also be performed on stage, which is where it differs from poetry and ci.</p>
<p>During the mid-Ming Dynasty, although qu was divided into northern and southern factions in terms of system, its music and lyrics, that is, the performance method in music, varied from place to place. According to Xu Wenchang's Nanci Xulu, there were the Yiyang tune of Jiangxi, the Haiyan tune of Zhejiang, the Yuyao tune, and the Gaoyang tune of Hubei. It can be seen that although the qu lyrics were the same at that time, their singing methods varied from place to place. The chaotic situation can be imagined. During the Jiajing and Longqing period in the mid-Ming Dynasty, there was a music expert named Wei Liangfu in Kunshan, Jiangsu, who saw this situation and lived in seclusion, studying the ancient and modern musical temperaments to correct the rhythm as his own responsibility. After ten years of hard work, he invented a kind of water milled tune and wrote a medical book on musical temperament to pass on to the world. His disciple Liang Chenyu Bolong wrote Jiangdong Bai Shuqu and Huansha Ji Chuanqi, which restored Yang and greatly expanded it. Since the water milled tune came out, other tunes have been overwhelmed, and it has dominated the opera arena and dance pavilions until the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty, for three hundred years. In the history of music and drama in our country, it is a brilliant and bright flower, because the water milled tune deeply studies the joys and sorrows of the plot and the four tones of Yin and Yang of the word sound, and the fast and slow, rising and falling of its rhythms, without any sound that does not have a theoretical basis, to match the sound of the heavens, so it can be so popular and far-reaching. At that time, this tune was named Kunshan Tune because it came from Kunshan, and it was abbreviated as Kun Tune.</p>
<p>From this point of view, since Kun Tune can overwhelm other tunes and its popularity is so widespread, it cannot be regarded as local music. The Kun Opera performed with this music cannot be regarded as local drama. In the history of art in our country, it certainly has a national value and status.</p>
<p>However, why was the military tune so popular at that time, and why has it declined in recent times? The reason for this can also be briefly stated: The reason why Kun Opera is popular is that it has its characteristics: (1) The writing is beautiful and is praised by scholars. (2) The matching music matches the original sound of each word in the lyrics, so the tones of Yin and Yang, Qing and Zhuo are different. The music also changes accordingly. There are no lyrics in the world that have the same words, so there are absolutely no completely identical scores. (3) The pronunciation and intonation, whether in singing or in dialogue, are based on phonetics, and the words are correct and the sounds are round. (4) The performance posture maintains the legacy of Tang Dynasty dance, which is beautiful and elegant, symbolizing the good and peaceful attitude of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>As for the reasons for the rise and fall of Kun Opera, the author believes that they are generally no more than the following reasons: (1) The rhetoric component is too heavy, and it is not easy for the public to appreciate. (2) The analysis of word sounds is too detailed, and when it encounters a long delay in sound, it is difficult to recognize. (3) Most of the composers are literati and scholars, who are good at writing but lack stage experience, so the arrangement and layout often cannot cater to the psychology of the audience. (4) The stage structure and the audience's understanding of music are different now and in the past, so the sound and appearance performances that were praised by people in the past are often incomprehensible to people today. Although Kun Opera is declining now, its advantages not only always exist, but are also imitated by other operas. It will not perish.</p>
<h3>Script</h3>
<p>— He Dingji</p>
<p>"A Song to Remember" depicts the life of the Polish musician Chopin. It's very difficult to get the best evaluation of a biographical film because people familiar with Chopin's life will know that this film fails to truly represent Chopin's true personality. The screenwriter only took the outline of a certain part of his life's deeds. In the story, we praise the screenwriter's selection of materials. He doesn't focus on the characters in the story. Instead, by means of this outline, he praises a kind of spirit to move the audience.</p>
<p>From Chopin's childhood piano practice, the author only took a story to portray Chopin's soul, that is, when he and Professor Elsner looked out the window at the Russian cavalry team, he angrily hit the piano keys to show his protest to them. As an adult, he sneaked into Paris because he was unwilling to perform in front of the Russian "executioner." This is proof of his patriotism and his spirit of resistance to tyranny!</p>
<p>The screenwriter wrote Chopin as a captive of love, while George Sand was written as a jealous, bold, and selfish woman. If it weren't for this paragraph, then Chopin would not be sympathized with by the audience.</p>
<p>When Chopin saw the soil of his motherland again, he suddenly woke up from the maze of private feelings and rekindled his love for his country. He played the "Polonaise" everywhere and died of weakness! The spirit of this patriotic musician Chopin will last as long as the "Polonaise."</p>
<p>Although the actors in the film are well-matched, the other three main characters, except for Paul Muni, are not as perfect as ideal. They are only competent. Paul Muni is more prominent from beginning to end, especially when the publisher promised him to hold a concert in a few days and he was so happy that he fell down. Conner Zaelde is better in this "mad scene." The best thing is: traveling around to perform, decisive piano playing, and the sweat on his forehead became more and more numerous. This is the most successful.</p>
<h3>Good Shots</h3>
<p>— Shi Xing</p>
<p>Watching the film "A Song to Remember" also made me feel like I was in the era of the 19th century, witnessing the tragedy of a national talented musician in the contradiction between love and responsibility.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best shots.</p>
<p>Chopin (as a child) was practicing the piano when he suddenly saw the scene of the Imperial Russian occupation army abusing Polish citizens outside the window. Then the elegant piano sound suddenly became a pounding sound of hitting the piano keys wildly. The director expressed his anger in the chaotic piano sounds like thousands of horses galloping.</p>
<p>Chopin played to entertain guests at a banquet in a certain nobleman's house. At the end of a piece, the guests asked to play again. Suddenly, the governor of Poland sent by the Tsar arrived. The earl rushed to greet him and asked Chopin to continue playing. Chopin was extremely angry and said, "I don't want to play in front of the Tsar's butcher." Then he walked out proudly.</p>
<p>Because it was difficult for Chopin to live in his hometown for a long time, he wanted to escape to Paris. Before leaving, his anti-enemy comrade and lover gave him a handful of Polish soil, wishing him not to forget his motherland.</p>
<p>Chopin followed his music teacher Professor Elsner to Paris, and was fortunate enough to be supported by the French romantic writer George Sand and the famous aristocrat Aster's family, and became famous in one fell swoop. Since then, he began to distance himself from his professor, forgetting his country and comrades, and plunged into George's arms - a peaceful and carefree world. George loved Chopin deeply, and in the communication with her parents, she concealed everything. Once, the professor went to Sand's house to visit Chopin. Sand refused the two to meet on the grounds that "I don't want to disturb him while he is working." The professor called out Chopin's name, who was playing the piano upstairs, and the piano sound stopped sadly, but soon continued. Chopin chose the former in the contradiction between leisure and hardship, and the professor returned in disappointment.</p>
<p>The Polish liberation movement suffered extreme hardships and setbacks. Countless comrades were arrested, and only money could be used to rescue them, and only Chopin's art could be exchanged for a lot of money. His old lover sneaked into Paris and transferred a bag of Polish soil to him. In the pain of contradiction, Chopin finally broke free from the shackles of love and went to various places in Europe to perform and raise money to repay the country, but his weak body eventually fell ill. On his deathbed, he said, "I seem to be going home." His dear teacher, lover, friends all surrounded him, except for George Sand, whom he hoped to meet but did not.</p>
<p>"The fascination of the mistress, the supervision of the good teacher, attacked from left and right, the suffering of the motherland, and the pain of oneself, afflicted inside and out, ended the moving deeds of the great musician Chopin's life."</p>
<h3>After Reading "Today's Chinese Playwrights"</h3>
<p>— Du Xin from Linzhun</p>
<p>I have a few opinions on Naya's article "Today's Chinese Playwrights" published on October 7th:</p>
<p>(1) The article only mentions four playwrights of "Today's China", which is quite like the title of "Today's Chinese Playwrights" not only referring to these four, but only mentioning these four playwrights seems not to match the general title of "Today's Chinese Playwrights". The author Mr. Naya said: "At present, I will introduce and review the playwrights you are familiar with." The playwrights "you are familiar with" seem to be more than these four.</p>
<p>(2) I dare not casually express my "review" of Mr. Naya, such as "...In "Thunderstorm", Sifeng swore to her mother that she would be struck by lightning in the future. As a result, she did go, and she was struck by lightning and died. It can be said that this kind of wording that promotes superstition is his only mistake." The playwright used this technique to strengthen the tragic atmosphere, which is precisely where it is appropriate. It seems that it cannot be said out of context that he is: "A very backward fatalist who puts a character into fate." Regarding the "review" of Chen Baiwei, Mr. Naya said: "Lu Yantu's official lord seems a bit too much. The official says what, and that's what he says. He has forgotten the rights of the people." The writer's intention is to expose the incompetence and shamelessness of general corrupt officials. Of course, emphasis must be placed to achieve the purpose of playwriting. How can he say "a bit too much"?</p>
<p>(3) "Phoenix City" is a work by Wu Zuguang. Mr. Naya "introduced" it in Yuan Jun's work. In addition to "Small Town Story", Yuan Jun also has "Border Town Story", both of which are "towns". "Town" after "town" can easily confuse people. Maybe Mr. Naya remembered it wrong for a while. I think Mr. Naya will never "put Zhang's hat on Li's head".</p>
<p>The above three points, although the meaning is not elegant, I don't know whether Mr. Naya can accept it?</p>
<h3>"Unforgettable Tune" Doesn't Align with Chopin's Life</h3>
<p>— Li Wenxun</p>
<p>After seeing "Unforgettable Tune," a friend softly said to me, "Tenderness makes me weep..."</p>
<p>Chopin was just like that. His name represented a piece of loving heart. In his contemplative eyes, one could see the piety of a believer, the sorrow of a dreamer, and the passion for the land. His dying voice was not so much like the final cry of a dying bird. He called out the names of Christ and the Holy Mother. That fervent voice could truly reach heaven. He kissed the cross with pale lips!</p>
<p>"I love God and people"! What sincere last words. He said, "Now I have arrived at the borders of happiness"!</p>
<p>The poet of the piano, his music possessed sorrow, romance, lyricism, and fantasy. His piano playing and his composing were both unparalleled. Pearl-like scales, sweet, tender, as gentle as tears, as clear as tears. His hands appeared slender, with delicate fingers and wrists, yet he could play intervals of a tenth. Those two hands covered a third of the keyboard, truly a wondrous sight, like a charming snake opening its red mouth to swallow a white rabbit. His wise eyes, the seductive lips of a woman, a large aquiline nose, and a Byronic collar around his neck—that was such a lovable poet. A lovable Polish man.</p>
<p>The voice of Chopin's soul is still important to people of our century, but formally, it has been obviously ignored. Program music has taken the art of the spiritual to mythology. Chopin neither preached nor painted, nor did he have the formality of self-cultivation and the theater. This is a kind of audible poem, like the fragrance of a rose in bloom, sharing common ground with Verlaine, Shelley, Keats, and others, but Chopin is always incomparable. He is special and also common. Special in his genius, and common in that he used his genius to express Poland. His music not only belongs to Poland but also speaks of the sorrow and aspirations of the Polish people. He wholeheartedly embraced Poland with the dignity and passion of humanity. He extremely detested boredom and vulgar souls. He suffered alone in his sweet human realm, feeling sorrow in his beautiful soul...</p>
<p>Chopin died, and a bouquet of flower-like sounds was extinguished. As for George Sand, she possessed the strength of a man, too strong a desire to conquer. She treated men like hotels, residing temporarily and moving on at any time, the same to Chopin as to Musset. According to her own explanation, it was "a mother's affection," acting as a mother, nanny, confidante, and caretaker, but her passions were as vigorous as her creations. The sentimental Chopin could not satisfy her. She needed a piece of music that was strong, like a tempest.</p>
<p>Regarding Chopin, the arrangement of "Unforgettable Tune" is somewhat inaccurate!</p>
<p>The Third Power Plant of China Electric went to Wuxi to film "Distant Love," performed by Drama Propaganda Team Nine. The picture shows Qin Yi with female comrades of Team Nine. From right: Qin Yi, Zhu Lin, Shi Dan, Huang Wenru, Zhao Yuan, Cai Wei.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk of a New Expedition</h3>
<p>— Ma Boliang</p>
<p>Iron Hoof and Blood Tears</p>
<p>Joan of Arc accepted religious sacrifice, and Joan accepted the disaster of love. They were both equally calm. Because of their calm, Joan's glance at the threshold, her final farewell to life, makes us feel a rare sorrow. The person walking to the execution ground sheds a little tear, shimmering brightly for a while, and is then killed. The music box is still singing.</p>
<p>There are stories like "Hate of a Maiden," and the suspense of "Spy Commando." Don't pursue ideals too much. I have long been tired of anti-Nazi films. I may forget Bobby Stevenson, the director of "Hate of a Maiden," but I cannot forget Robert Stevenson of "Iron Hoof and Blood Tears." "Jane Eyre" is his glorious milestone. He customarily uses his rounded techniques, deep close-ups, photographic lighting, and rich atmosphere to set off this love story. He helps the actors to act, letting their emotions flicker in the light and shadow, letting their strong eyes and numb lips speak a lifetime of words. The cast is thus even stronger. Paul Henreid has always been more at ease than Cornel Wilde. Mitchum’s cheeks are too wide; his profile is very good. Alan Ladd has few scenes, so he doesn't count. Thomas Mitchell, Wright Krieg, and Melvyn Douglas are famous supporting actors, skilled and naturally competent.</p>
<p>If we are to tremble with fear of death from now on, we had better read the words of Mrs. Matheson; "The idea of death should stimulate us to devote our lives to the noblest purposes, giving the highest value to every moment that composes it." This is the spirit of Joan of Arc and Joan.</p>
<p>Iron Window Lovebirds</p>
<p>The world is so big, everyone flies outward, with endless realms to fly through and endless experiences to live through. "Iron Window Lovebirds" tells the story of three people flying outward, paying the price of struggle for each stop. Danny mistakenly goes astray, and although he regrets it, he has his own road of struggle ahead. Will he turn back? Yes, when he is tired of flying, he may come to see this couple in distress, but he will never be satisfied with this ordinary life. He is not a simple good person. Danny is the only colorful character in this ordinary subject matter. Richard Whorf brings him to life. He saves his good friend and also saves the film. Thus, Anne Shirley's dancer Laura and Ronald Reagan's young Steve can finally be seen as somewhat lovely. In fact, this couple is only seen for their appearance.</p>
<p>A rare love tragedy, every time I think of the desolation of Waterloo Bridge, I vaguely remember Vivien Leigh walking on Waterloo Bridge. The sound of the car is pitiable, and she walks past with perseverance. The reflections in the water, the lights of the military vehicles, the staring yellow eyes of the devil, the system and fate, humanity's eternal wall. Her eyes look through it, and it is the memory of the candle dance. Joy is so short-lived, just a moment, a cry of sorrow. Robert Taylor has the same memory as us. Once, twice, having experienced the vicissitudes of life, he still remembers Waterloo Bridge in the dark night, so profound, so tragic. Mervyn LeRoy has every reason to be proud of this film.</p>

<h3>Soul of Freedom</h3>
<p>— Wu Shuyu</p>
<p>According to the transcripts of the trials of traitors published in the newspapers, almost all of the thousands of them can be summed up with this formula: that is, every traitor, when on trial, is bound to explain the motives and circumstances of his becoming a traitor under compulsion. In this narrative of compulsion, he tries in every way to highlight that his motive was beneficial to the war of resistance, and that the circumstances involved covering up underground work within the anti-Japanese camp; sometimes, those cunning and fickle traitors, knowing full well that their absurd talk cannot sway the perceptions of the prosecutors, would turn their brains to insert an interlude, saying something like, "At the beginning, I originally intended to commit suicide, but later... it was not able to become a reality, and this may be a mistake," and so on. Just how many traitors said these absurd words, I don't have any clippings at hand to list them; but based on my memory, Ding Mocun, the head of the puppet secret service "76" on Jessfield Road, was one of them.</p>
<p>Later—no, perhaps a few days before the trial of Ding Mocun, the High Prosecutor's Office once summoned film artists who had sided with the enemy, but unfortunately, that summons resulted in those who were ill becoming sicker, and those who were escaping escaping, preventing us from reading their testimonies in the newspapers. Now, according to newspaper reports, the High Prosecutor's Office is preparing to summon another batch of film artists who sided with the enemy. It is difficult to repeat the same mistake, and whether the High Prosecutor's Office this time is taking precautions to prevent them from becoming ill again, or preventing them from escaping again, is unknown; but, as a movie fan, I very much hope that it will not be in vain and that I will be able to read their testimonies in the newspapers, and I am also willing to do some voluntary proofreading, to see just how different the testimonies of this batch of film artists who sided with the enemy are from the testimony of the puppet secret service head Ding Mocun? The reason is that the latter, in his actions, promoted the cause of the enemy and puppets, and crushed our patriotic heroes, while the former, in their thoughts, took their cues from the enemy to anesthetize and soften our patriotic heroes and our next generation.</p>
<p>If this voluntary proofreading finds that their testimonies are the same, and that there is also such an interlude, then they are truly "brothers in distress," thinking alike; and if, because this batch of film artists who sided with the enemy are artists, they even say and do, giving an on-the-spot performance, then the story is ready-made, the screenwriter and director are ready-made, and the actors are ready-made, so we can shoot a film and call it "Soul of Freedom." Who is the director? A joint director. Who are the actors? The entire cast. Then it is sure to be vivid and well-done, and "Silver Screen of the Ages" is sure to "be passed down for ten thousand generations."</p>
<p>Having written this far, what I wanted to say is already said; but picking up the manuscript and reading it from the beginning, I find that there is still one film boss missing. This not-so-small problem is really a bit troublesome. What to do? I can only look for him slowly. If I really can't find him, then regarding the affairs of the puppet China Film Company, there were the traitor Chu Minyi and the traitor Zhou Fohai, so why not choose between the two? If we choose Chu Minyi, then the "Number One" big traitors residing in foreign countries, such as Wang Zhaoming, Chen Gongbo, and the like, would certainly laugh loudly, "The China Film United Co., Ltd. has already been organized and established, and we will soon be able to see brand-new domestic films."</p>
<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>— Wu Changsong</p>
<h3>Four Poems Mourning the Deceased</h3>
<p>— Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>The author, Mr. Wang Yizhi, and Ms. Li Zhaoshi, are among the best of contemporary married writers. Their relationship was deep and loving. They traveled in Europe for decades, working tirelessly. During the War of Resistance, Ms. Li, under the mandate of the Nationalist Government, devoted herself to the Dutch diplomatic circle, bearing burdens for her compatriots and advocating for her country, securing the safety of the rights and interests of overseas Chinese in that country, until she succumbed to illness from overwork, passing away this spring on March 3. When the bad news was transmitted remotely, relatives, friends, and old acquaintances alike deeply mourned her. Reading Mr. Yizhi's line, "Her jade body was truly donated for the sake of the people," further increases our infinite sorrow!</p>
<p>The attached picture is a Western-style art print that Ms. Li enjoyed during her lifetime, and it is hereby introduced.</p>
<p>Hard to turn back, the allotted time, a double three was hardship.</p>
<p>Impossible to fully recount the joys and sorrows of tens of thousands of weights.</p>
<p>Endless and boundless, grace like the sea,</p>
<p>Continuous Sunday morning window bells.</p>
<p>The world is endless, sorrow is endless. It is the double three memorial day of the passing of my late wife, Zhaoshi, which is also the so-called Sunday by Western religious scholars. From now on, every time I hear the crisp bells of the morning window on the Sabbath, I feel like the person visiting a foreign land in the novels of the beautiful novelist Bai Zhujun, overwhelmed by the sorrows of past and present.</p>
<p>Cold, lingering yellow bamboo, snow before the wind,</p>
<p>Dreams broken, azure meadow, world outside the home,</p>
<p>Compared to the outstanding Su Xiaomei in affection,</p>
<p>Illness akin to Jia Changsha's grief for the country.</p>
<p>Zhaoshi loved Dongpo's snow, and her illness was akin to Jia Yi's love for the country. Even in the third month of the northern spring, it was still bitterly cold, and the snow outside the hospital window had not completely melted.</p>
<p>Calamity and gold, a vast new catastrophe,</p>
<p>Pengzu and Shang, apes and cranes, all turned to dust,</p>
<p>Twice adrift, grieving over the European war,</p>
<p>Ten memories of flowers, tragically not spring.</p>
<p>In the years of Wuwu and Yiyou, they were adrift twice. Silently recognizing the unspoken, tragic farewell at the Catholic Hospital, it was exactly 9,999 days from Mao Yi's easy migration to North America. Alas, the calamity of war, which should be permanently abolished.</p>
<p>Chastity and strength tested in the fiery furnace,</p>
<p>Struggles relying entirely on great wisdom's circle,</p>
<p>Woman's writings, man's spirit,</p>
<p>Her jade body truly donated for the sake of the people.</p>
<p>For five years during the European war, she experienced countless storms and waves, busying herself day and night with rescue efforts, sparing no material or spiritual sacrifice, striving to cope, her strength exhausted and her body weakened. Apart from me, who else knows this? I had been separated from her for a long time. When sorting through her belongings, I found a letter to a certain public official dated January 30. The spirit of the writing is imperishable, further showing her chastity and strength.</p>
<h3>Pasteur, Benefactor of Mankind</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>50th Anniversary of His Death</p>
<p>Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) was a great modern French biologist who discovered microbes, sparking a revolution in medicine and greatly benefiting mankind. His research focused on crystal formation, fermentation, diseases of wine, rabies, infectious diseases of livestock, and human infectious diseases. He was a member of the Académie Française and the Académie des Sciences. In 1886, international donations were used to build the Pasteur Institute in Paris, focusing on microbiology, serum therapy, and biochemistry. Subsequently, Pasteur Institutes were established in Lille, northern France, and in various cultural centers around the world; - China's Pasteur Institute is located at No. 207 Avenue Joffre, Shanghai (renamed Jin Shenfu Road).</p>
<p>This year marks the 50th anniversary of Pasteur's death. The Shanghai Pasteur Institute is scheduled to hold a commemorative ceremony at the Institute on Sunday, December 15th, at 9:00 a.m., and has specially invited experts to give a lecture: "The Progress of Pasteur's Inventions in Pure Biology and Everyday Science."</p>
<p>Since there is an expert lecture, I will not be adding anything superfluous. What I want to introduce is the humility and filial piety of this scholar who is admired all over the world. On July 14, 1882 (note: July 14 is France's National Day), the City Council of Dole, Pasteur's hometown, placed a commemorative plaque on the wall of the house where Pasteur was born, in the presence of Pasteur himself. After a speech by the mayor, Pasteur gave a reply: I am now translating this reply for commemoration.</p>
<p>Gentlemen:</p>
<p>The city of Dole has given me a great honor today, and I am deeply grateful; however, please allow me to protest against this excessive glory. This kind of respect is only suitable for famous deceased people, but it has been mistakenly bestowed upon a mere mortal like myself. However, you are too quick to go beyond the criticism of future generations!</p>
<p>Will your resolution be revised? Mr. Mayor, shouldn't you have first carefully notified the City Council not to adopt this too hasty plan?</p>
<p>But, gentlemen, I have protested against this overly flamboyant worship—which I am absolutely unworthy of—please allow me to express how deeply moved I am, down to the depths of my soul. On this commemorative plaque, your sympathy has combined the two things I have loved and been most excited about in my life: a love for science and a devotion to family.</p>
<p>Oh! My father and my mother! Oh! My dear departed ones! You used to live such frugal lives in this little house, and everything I have is a gift from you! My courageous mother, you passed on your enthusiasm to me. If I always combine the greatness of science with the greatness of the motherland, it is because I am filled with the ideas that you have inspired in me. And you, my dear father, your life was as difficult as your profession, and you once showed me what kind of results constant effort can achieve. It is because of you that I have learned to be persistent in my daily work. You not only provided the willpower to turn life into something useful, but you also worshiped great people and great causes. High vision and continued efforts to move upward: this is what you taught me. I recall that after finishing work every day, you would always read contemporary history, which reminded you of the glorious era you had witnessed. When you were teaching me reading and writing, you never forgot to teach me about the greatness of France.</p>
<p>Bless you, my beloved parents, for your usual words and deeds, let me give you the respect that is being shown to this house today.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I thank you for allowing me to frankly state what I have thought in my heart for sixty years. I thank you for this celebration and your hospitality, and I thank the city of Dole, which watches over every one of its children, and has such a memory for me!</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>A Certain Factory Owner</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met a certain factory owner at a banquet. He described his entrepreneurial experience to everyone, and some of his words were very meaningful and enlightening. I was very moved and would like to pass them on to my readers here.</p>
<p>He said: My business has suffered setbacks every year. In these ten years, if it weren't for these setbacks, the development of the business would certainly have been immeasurable. But thinking about it again, any kind of business has to suffer setbacks, and even the country suffers disasters! If there are no setbacks, the value of the business itself would be questionable. Courage can only appear in failure. One should face difficulties. The first type of ordinary businessmen only care about making money and don't care about anything else, and the second type sells their fields and buys property after making money, returning home to enjoy the blessings, wasting all the experience they have gained in their business. Neither of these two types is what our business community should have.</p>
<p>He also said: The encroachment of the recession is universally suffered by the entire business community. Everyone has difficulties, but there is no need to be overly alarmed like a snake in the cup, because if you are afraid, it will affect others. If others are also afraid, and everyone is afraid and doesn't take action, then isn't that a dead end?</p>
<p>I don't need to explain which factory this is, or what the owner's name is, but fifteen years ago he started this business with a capital of 7,000 yuan, and now it has become one of the leading manufacturers in this industry in the country. He has the courage, the vision, the willingness to sacrifice, is not afraid of difficulties, seeks progress, and does not deceive. All of these are factors in his success.</p>
<p>Let the rotten ones die. In the midst of the talk of recession in the business world, the true entrepreneurs will not fall. Perhaps this belief has not yet been recognized by the general public.</p>
<p>Fable Drama</p>
<h3>Farewell My Concubine</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>Cast: Strong as follows:</p>
<p>Chu Overlord — A certain factory boss, played by a local industrialist.</p>
<p>Yu Ji — Played by the boss's concubine</p>
<p>Fan Zeng — The factory's accountant (does not appear)</p>
<p>Scout — Played by a factory clerk</p>
<p>Han Xin — Gigolo (does not appear)</p>
<p>Dong Dong Qiang Qiang, gongs and drums start the show.</p>
<p>Chu Overlord: Thinking of the events of that year, how heartbreaking. I was so imposing in the past! I was invincible in every battle, always victorious. Yesterday prices rose by one time, today they rise by ten times, and tomorrow they will rise by a hundred times. Constantly rising, the "〇"s in the numbers were also captured by me one by one to increase the number of my assets. Not only did I make war profiteering, but I also made victory profiteering, and even dollar profiteering. But now, looking around, I am heavily in debt and have been besieged...</p>
<p>(The sound of songs of Chu from all sides is very noisy.)</p>
<p>Chu Overlord: Scout, go quickly and find out if the peddlers are gathering and coming, be careful of the glass windows!</p>
<p>(The scout leaves and returns.)</p>
<p>Scout: Reporting to the King, people's hearts are turning outward. The songs of Chu from all sides are just a chorus of shouts to buy foreign goods, as well as the sound of debt collection!</p>
<p>Chu Overlord! Alas—that infuriates me. Then, what should I do with my domestic products! Quickly summon Fan Zeng to devise a countermeasure.</p>
<p>Scout: Reporting to the King, Fan Zeng has left without saying goodbye, leaving this place to eat foreign food.</p>
<p>Chu Overlord: Ah...ah...spit, infuriates...infuriates me! You old thief, how could you have no patriotism!</p>
<p>Scout: Reporting to the King, you can't blame him. You can't pay his salary, but there are American dollars to be earned at the foreign company. Of course, Fan Zeng would abandon this and take that.</p>
<p>Chu Overlord: Alas, Heaven has forsaken me, Heaven has forsaken me! Customers are rushing to buy foreign goods, and employees are going to eat foreign food! Alas, a wooden factory owner, I, the Great King...alas, words cannot express it all!</p>
<p>Scout: Reporting to the King, although Fan Zeng went to eat foreign food, it is said that he didn't get to eat any "foreign meat" and got a "foreign stink" all over his body. Now he has died of scabies on the way!</p>
<p>Chu Overlord: That's right! History seems to have written it that way. Fan Zeng, that bitter old man, it was his fate to be so, well deserved! Come on, go invite Consort Yu Ji!</p>
<p>(The scout goes down, Yu Ji comes up)</p>
<p>Yu Ji: (A segment of singing before coming on stage. What she is singing, you wouldn't understand, so I have to delete it.) Yu Ji pays her respects to the Great King. May I ask what instructions the Great King has for summoning me?</p>
<p>Chu Overlord: My heart is very troubled, and I summoned you for no other reason than to ask my beloved consort to dance a sword for a while to ease my mind.</p>
<p>Yu Ji: You are old and immortal, are you senile? This is the atomic bomb era, do you still want to dance with swords?</p>
<p>Chu Overlord: You cheap thing, you are actually scolding me. What are you saying! What are you planning to do?</p>
<p>Yu Ji: You are already in a pile of debt, and you can't even pay the interest. What fun is there in being with you? I have decided to run away tomorrow.</p>
<p>Chu Overlord: Alas, that infuriates me. (Saying that, he began to sing the lyrics of "My strength uproots mountains, my spirit surpasses the world.")</p>
<p>"Prices rise, sorrow surpasses the world,</p>
<p>The time is unfavorable, foreign goods fill the market,</p>
<p>Interest at 20%, what can be done,</p>
<p>Wife runs off with another, what to do!"</p>
<p>Go, do as you please: Ah, wait a minute. Who are you running off with?</p>
<p>Yu Ji: The gigolo Han Xin.</p>
<p>Chu Overlord: Good heavens! I thought you were running off with the foreign sailor, Hello Joe! Nine out of ten gigolos are unreliable. How do you know that Han Xin definitely wants you?</p>
<p>Yu Ji: You can ask if you don't believe me. If he doesn't want me, I would rather commit suicide in front of you.</p>
<p>Chu Overlord picks up the phone and dials a number: Hello, is this Liu Bang's office? Get Han Xin on the phone. Hello, Han Xin, are you seducing my wife? What? You don't want her...</p>
<p>Yu Ji goes over, grabs the phone and says: Hello, darling, you...what?...you...ah, you heartless and soulless thing. (Saying that, she hangs up the phone.)</p>
<p>Chu Overlord: You didn't listen to my old advice, and you are suffering now. According to the plot, you should commit suicide while dancing with a sword. You said this is the atomic bomb era and refused to dance with a sword. Do you intend to commit suicide with an atomic bomb? Ah, that would be too extravagant, too much of a show.</p>
<p>Yu Ji remains silent, takes out a bottle of DDT from her bag, drinks three mouthfuls in a row, and then, alas, she dies! (She also goes back to rest backstage.)</p>
<p>Chu Overlord goes into battle again, but after a few rounds, he is defeated and forced by the creditors to the Wujiang intersection, where he meets the elders of Jiangdong—a group of "wild chicken lawyers."</p>
<p>Elders of Jiangdong: Great King, you don't need to fight with those creditors. Things are already like this, it's better to retreat early. Come to me, declare bankruptcy, and implement liquidation! When the Third World War breaks out, you can regroup and make war profiteering again!</p>
<p>Chu Overlord: I am grateful for your kindness. But forget it! I am a dignified seven-foot man and won't do those fussy things. Ah, let's open the skylight and speak frankly. The litigation fee, advertising fee, liquidation fee, etc. of your lawyers are also quite frightening. To be honest, I can't pay, I only have an empty checkbook left, I offer this to thank old friends and express my meager intentions. According to history and the plot, here at the Wujiang intersection, I, Xiang Yu, should draw my sword and commit suicide. However, Yu Ji is right, this is the atomic age, and doing this kind of thing again seems too foolish. Look, in the distance, a jeep has already driven over. To die under a peony flower is romantic even as a ghost, to die under a jeep should be modern even as a ghost! I wish my Chu Overlord to be famous for centuries! (The curtain closes! The play ends!)</p>
<h3>Words from a Clerk at a Western Clothing Store</h3>
<p>— Shuo Shi</p>
<p>Yesterday, in a chance encounter, I met an old neighbor who runs a Western clothing store. We felt unexpectedly harmonious, truly like "a thousand cups are too few when drinking with a kindred spirit." From his words, he hinted at many inside stories of the Western clothing industry.</p>
<p>Not only him, but also I, always feel very strange, why do Chinese people blindly worship "foreign goods"? This is especially common in Shanghai. For example, take the current Western clothing industry: the fabrics displayed in the shop windows are mostly made in China. However, the Western clothing store owners all change their names to foreign ones, turning them into foreign goods, taking advantage of the general customers' blind worship of "foreign goods are always better" mentality. Sure enough, customers flock to the store; if not, business would be slow!</p>
<p>Furthermore, for example, if there is a piece of Melton cloth, the Western clothing store owner cuts it into two sections, one section saying it is made in China, the other section saying it is from a foreign source (but in fact, it is still from the same piece). When regular customers come, they pretend that this section is "Chinese goods" and that section is "foreign goods", letting customers choose. And surprisingly, there are customers who praise foreign goods as being better than Chinese goods. How truly absurd and wronged! Are these so-called "Chinese goods" and "foreign goods" not cut from the same piece of cloth?</p>
<h3>Here and Now</h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>Group Suing for Land</p>
<p>Shanghai people like novelty. As long as the action is unusual, one can definitely prevail, whether it's doing business or begging.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, I walked past Jinling East Road and saw five or six people kneeling side by side on the ground. In front of them, they had written several lines of begging words in chalk, all of which turned out to be suing for land.</p>
<p>Group suing for land – the term is fresh enough, and only Shanghai has it. But it also shows the seriousness of this "year-end hurdle."</p>
<p>Beauty Photo Studio</p>
<p>There is a photo studio on Linsen Middle Road. The photos taken are on average several degrees more beautiful than the person's original appearance. Often, when picking up the photos, it takes a minute or two to recognize oneself. Calling it a beauty photo studio can be said to match the name with the reality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that photo studio often delays the development and pick-up of photos, which is somewhat imperfect. Furthermore, one point should be specially reminded to readers: photographs from that photo studio are not reliable for choosing a husband or a girlfriend. At the very least, one should discount them by 20% or 30%.</p>
<p>杞人之憂 (Worries of the Man of Qi - Worries About Unnecessary Things)</p>
<p>With money in my pocket, I thought of buying a scarf to keep warm. I walked into the first store, liked one, and asked for the price, which was 32,000. Then I went into the second store and saw the same goods, priced at only 28,000. Although it was cheaper, I still couldn't bear to buy it. Finally, from a street vendor, I exchanged 20,000 for the same woolen scarf as before.</p>
<p>Afterwards, thinking about it, I was happy and fearful at the same time. Happy that I bought a bargain, afraid that before the end of the year, Shanghai would experience the same situation as above: "Store owners destroying street vendors"?</p>
<p>Shanghai Cross-Section</p>
<h3>The Beggars' Organization 16</h3>
<p>— Huang Jia Mo</p>
<p>Scavenging · "Leading the Sheep" · "Walking Corpse"</p>
<p>In the local beggar gang, capable brothers all strive hard. Their paths to making money are as described in the previous sections. However, the older and weaker beggars in the gang, due to physical weakness, some addicted to opium, can't afford opium and switch to heroin. These people are lazy by nature, wearing tattered clothes, and are neither able to "work diligently" like their brothers in the gang, nor bear heavy burdens and travel far to sell their labor. Therefore, they have to act alone, at irregular times, on their own. This is considered the most humble beggar in the gang, not only looked down upon by passers-by, but also ashamed to be associated with by the brothers in the gang.</p>
<p>"Panning for Gold and Sweeping for Pearls" is such a beautiful term! It turns out it is the slang for scavenging. It is a testament to their creativity. These people go out scavenging every day with empty baskets, called "carrying a hundred-treasure box". Their lives are free and unrestricted. The destination for scavenging is the garbage cans in various alleys, and the garbage piles in residential areas. Although they are the lowest-level business, their income is considerable. Because the mansions and homes in Shanghai are mostly accustomed to extravagant living, often squandering resources, discarding miscellaneous items at will. The beggars are practitioners of waste utilization. In their eyes, there is money in these many garbage. They know how to "pan for gold and sweep for pearls". Whether it's old glass bottles, old cans, scrap metal, bamboo pieces, or wood, everything is worth collecting and then reselling to specialty shops for wasteland goods. Before the war, the average daily income could be one yuan.</p>
<p>In the era of the enemy puppet regime, resources were scarce. Any broken glass, waste paper, or damaged cloth could be used as raw materials for papermaking or other purposes. These beggars actually had a considerable surplus. After the war, when the U.S. military arrived in Shanghai, a large amount of American goods flowed in, and residents discarded the old for the new, often abandoning the old items that they had cherished in the past, adding a lot of valuable old goods to the beggars. Especially near the U.S. military barracks, one could often pick up large quantities of empty cans, old wooden boxes, and brand-new old cloth bags. Near the UNRRA warehouses, the abandoned miscellaneous items were extremely considerable. It was no longer "panning for gold and sweeping for pearls", but "accepting everything on the list". Because everything was valuable, no wonder the scavengers scrambled for it, fearing to miss it!</p>
<p>"Snatching the Sheep in Passing", abbreviated as "leading the sheep", is to engage in both scavenging and theft under the guise of scavenging. Their plan is very cunning and meticulous, and it is not easy to solve the case. The target items are the light and heavy miscellaneous items placed at the back doors of the residents in the alleys, stealing them when people are not paying attention. They immediately put them into the box of wasteland goods, and then cover them with unclean paper and cloth garbage. No one suspects them of stealing, and no one wants to inspect their dirty baskets. Therefore, they can freely enter and leave the alleys under the cover of scavenging, taking materials on the spot, appropriately and stopping. Although what they get are some not very valuable things, but over time, selling them can also be quite profitable. For example, "fresh lotus leaves" - (are clothes soaked in water buckets that have not yet been washed, and a few pieces are taken when the maid walks away). "Floating white paper" - (clothes that have been晒掛 - hung out to dry). "Moon" - (various sizes of wooden basins). "Dull crow" - (various sizes of chairs and stools). "Bird head" - (wooden toilet), and other scattered sundries.</p>
<p>There is also a strange profession called "stealing pig ears", which is theft combined with extortion. Those who engage in this must have two people as partners. "Pig ears" are toilet seat covers. One person first enters the alley early in the morning to scavenge, and steal toilet seat covers. At this time, most people are still asleep, and there are several toilets placed at the back doors of every household. Because the toilet matters have already been taken care of at this time, the maids are busy serving in the kitchen, and the toilets have been washed or not washed. Therefore, these people take the opportunity to "pick pig ears" a few, put them in the basket, and slip away. When the maids discover it, they immediately make a fuss. Then one person from the gang comes to inquire, saying that the thief has been seen, and how much money is needed to redeem it, the price ranging from one or two yuan per piece. Although the residents know that they are in league, they only want to redeem the items. They do not want to cause a lawsuit for this small amount. Originally, a toilet seat cover is not worth much, and it is even less valuable to resell after stealing it. However, residents cannot do without a toilet for a day, let alone a toilet seat cover. Toilets come in different sizes, and there is no place to buy a toilet seat cover specifically for a particular toilet, and there is absolutely nothing else that can replace it. As a result, the entire toilet is equivalent to garbage. The beggars deeply understand this difficulty and actually use stealing toilet seat covers as a way to extort money. It is truly the ultimate prank!</p>
<p>"Walking Corpse" is to be hired to carry the store's signboard, moving through the streets and alleys, or wearing strange clothes and hats, full of advertising words, acting as an active advertisement for the store. The individual is called "Walking Corpse". This profession was already seen in the early years of the Republic of China. But because it is vulgar and not elegant, it has almost disappeared in recent years.</p>
<p>Weekend Chats</p>
<h3>Between Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Collective Opinion</p>
<p>The Ever-Intense Family Problem</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: This time, there were the most submissions for this chat. This publication only selects different opinions from the submissions and discloses them below. Due to the excessive backlog of submissions, this issue will be repeated once in the next issue. New opinions are still extremely welcome.)</p>
<p>The Son Is Responsible</p>
<p>I believe that when the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are at odds, the son should bear the majority of the responsibility. Because these types of family disputes are mostly caused by his inability to evenly divide the love and obligations between his mother, his son and his wife. (Qian Changnian)</p>
<p>Physiological Factors</p>
<p>In addition to conflicting interests, there are also physiological reasons for the discord between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Although mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are both women, their temperaments and actions are often in opposite positions. The age difference between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is at least more than twenty years. Physiologically, when a woman is around 24 years old, her blood and energy are strong, her actions are lively, and she easily reacts to all stimuli. If she is around 45 years old, menstruation begins to stop. Women in menopause are prone to emotional changes, have peculiar temperaments, are extremely prone to anger, and their ability to adapt to the environment is very weak. Therefore, in terms of temperament, one is calm and stubborn, and the other is lively and active. Coupled with conflicting interests, of course there is no way to reconcile! (Yun Xin)</p>
<p>The Conflict of Two Kinds of Love</p>
<p>To put it thoroughly, it is destined that there is no way to coordinate between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. This is a conflict between husband-wife love and mother-son love, an opposition of two different interests. There is nothing that can make the two of them close together. Even if it is superficial harmony, it is only the result of their wider tolerance and deeper cultivation. It is definitely not that this mother-in-law and daughter-in-law really have no cracks. Mother-son love and husband-wife love may be balanced, but once an accident occurs, mother-son love often cannot defeat husband-wife love! The reason is very simple: in terms of interests, husband-wife love, the lifelong interests of both are consistent. In terms of physiology, the ages are similar, and "sexual love" is exchanged. Therefore, as long as the relationship between husband and wife is really good, it is inevitable that the son will be slightly biased towards his wife. To be frank, this is due to the facts, and it is also due to the inherent selfishness of human beings! Therefore, the mother-in-law is always jealous of the daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>Therefore, the separation of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is the fundamental solution. Other non-thorough methods are only temporary and not permanent. (Suo Bei)</p>
<p>"Marrying a Daughter-in-Law"</p>
<p>It is clearly the son's marriage, but Mrs. × is called "marrying a daughter-in-law." The dignity of the mother-in-law can be displayed from this sentence. It also predetermines the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. (E)</p>
<p>A Word for the Mother-in-Law</p>
<p>Smart mother-in-law, I want to advise you, but please believe my sincerity and do not get angry. The current era is very different from the era when you were a daughter-in-law. The difference in social awareness and the progress of educational culture have already divided you and your daughter-in-law into two different areas. I think, when you were a daughter-in-law, you also secretly resented your strict, meticulous, and fault-finding mother-in-law. But at that time, limited by the old social concepts and the shackles of feudal thoughts, you had to hate in your heart even if you hated, shed tears secretly, and still had to wear a smile on your face on the surface. In fact, at that time, you also wanted to avoid the mother-in-law's over-strict control and live a free and happy life, didn't you? Therefore, now you forgive your daughter-in-law a little bit. People now cannot be compared with people in the past. Don't say those angry words of "marrying a daughter-in-law and selling a son"! Who doesn't love to play, jump, and live their little family life freely! Just let go, why bother to be their villain? You can ask nothing and enjoy your blessings peacefully, and be an affectionate mother-in-law! (Feng)</p>
<p>Three Opinions</p>
<p>(1) One's own daughter is the daughter-in-law of someone else in the future; one's own daughter-in-law is the former daughter of someone else; and the status of mother-in-law is also promoted from daughter-in-law. Although mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are not mother and daughter, they are all from "daughter" backgrounds and have tasted the taste of "mother-daughter love". If the mother-in-law can treat the daughter-in-law with the heart of treating her daughter, and the daughter-in-law can treat the mother-in-law with the heart of treating her mother, then, no matter what prejudice, it can be transformed into harmony and harmony!</p>
<p>(2) If they can be self-reliant, it is best for the daughter-in-law to form a small family with her husband, and live in a small house, so that the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law will have less separation and more gatherings. On the day of reunion, all previous faults will be released and the friendship will be more constant!</p>
<p>(3) If there is no ability to be self-reliant, then the daughter-in-law has to endure it for a while even if she is full of grievances! Only "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." When you become a mother-in-law in the future, don't vent the grievances you have suffered in the past on your daughter-in-law; otherwise, to put it jokingly, "retribution comes full circle", the feelings between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law will forever become a "fixed case"!
