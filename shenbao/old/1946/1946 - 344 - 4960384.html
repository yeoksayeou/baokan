<h3>政府爲謀恢復和談　考慮派員赴延安　政院八部長調任說不確</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕外部發言人葉公超，九日午後於中宣部記者招待會　　宣稱：政府正考慮派遣代表　赴延安，與共產黨磋商恢復談判　，請歡府將滙何人前往，則尚未決定。葉氏此一談話，係答　記者所詢，「外傳　府將派王世杰部長前赴延安，以爲恢復談　先聲確吾」一問題者。記者並對外傳國大因上述關係將再延長，確否？葉氏避不作答。另一記者問，報載將有八個部長政任省政府主席職，其空位則將由第三方面人士出任，此說是否司靠？葉稱：「余未聞此說」。記者問　政府若派代表赴延安，該代表將攙何種提案前往，葉謂：「將來可問該代表」。記者以葉之答覆不得要領，乃轉詢彭部長，彭謂：「有人認根據政院新組織法共增八個新部，遂認此八個部將由第三方面出任，而原任部長將轉任省政府主席，此種想法，以其過於「數學的」，反而不確」。會後彭氏語記者，政府對派遣代表赴延安事，「尙無具禮計劃」、某記者詢以「部長是否樂於前往」，彭笑而不答。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕京中近日盛傳將派大員赴延安，九日報　其人選可能爲王世杰，記者九日晨特往訪詢，王氏堅稱：「我決不曾去，至有沒有別人去，則不得而知」。據記者探悉，張　頗有可能，至外傳部力子，亦已經邵氏本人堅決否認。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕共產黨辦事處王炳南今晚對記者稱：共產黨前與馬使之函所提兩項要求，乃係一貫主張，從未更變，且今後亦不致變更，如此兩項政府不能接受，和談自無法重開。王氏並謂：今晚曾接延安電吿，以胡宗南部隊十一個團正向柳林一帶進攻，如此種戰事繼續下所引起之後果，當更不可設想。記者復詢以政府有派大員赴延之事，共產黨是否表示歡迎，王氏答以吾人尙未接獲任何通知，同時，和談亦必基於前提兩項要求也。</p>
<h3>馬司兩使長談　續作幕後調處</h3>

<h3>憲草審查會別記</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　張明　德　俞振基</p>
<p>第三審查會是今天上午各會中，最精釆，最能表現民主精神的一個會，主席潘公展在你一言，我一語之空氣中，始終鎭定處理，曾有一記者稱：「今日潘先生總是笑咪咪」。</p>
<p>發言最多的是立法委員，有陳長　，陳顧遠，劉不同等，說得各有千秋。陳長衡自先一篇道理是原則問題，接着劉不同說現在是原則問題，等會兒又是理論問題，如此討論下去，將不得入於正題，應行休會，接着陳長舊立刻起立發言：「我並不是說明理論……」。殊爲精采，充分表現立法院的精神。</p>
<p>陳潛溪今天第一個發言，還沒有宣布開會，才報吿出席人數爲八十四人已足法定人數一語後，就起立開砲，大聲責問：「是那一個決定的？八十四人已足法定人數？」召集人的回答是：「主席團的決定」。陳再來一砲：「是那一個這樣規定？爲什麼這樣規定？豈有此理！」這次爭吵，經主席略予解釋始能進行開會，但是這一暗流仍然存在。到了討論片刻以後，即再度提出，程滄波亦起立稱：「這不是我們一組單獨的閒題，而是全體如此的」。</p>
<p>陳潛溪發言次數很多，而且一再爭辯，主席於他某一次的談話後宣稱：根據國大組織法第七條之規定，發言應有時間與次數之限制，陳氏才暫吿罷休。</p>
<p>第七審委會由靑年黨謝澄平主持，態度議虛，運用靈活，口口聲聲」某某代表先生」，「貴組」，「請會場幹事先生」等等。以運用分行坐，先分組後，簽名的一着棋旣分明又雀事，令人連呼「妙絕」。</p>
<p>國民經濟小組選召集人時，有人提名王曉籲，主戴了瓜皮呢便帽，面團團的起來大聲說：「請主席注意，王曉籟不願意當選」。敎育文化小組有人提名朱家驊，朱也站起來說：「本人現正主持敎育行政，不便作召集人」。謝主席分別回答，要尊重會衆意見，不使多言，結果兩人還是當選了。</p>
<p>第七審委會四小組裏，以國民經濟與敎育文化兩小組人最多，國防外交與社會安全及衛生行政兩小組，則寥寥無幾。出席女代表一共十九人，她們的分配多寡是敎育文化小組十人，國民經濟小組五人，社會安全及衛生行政小組四人，國防外交小組則一個沒有，旁聽的人們說：「看呀。婦女界不要國防外交」，事實上國防外交小組席上坐的十之七是紅沿條黃呢大衣的國家衛士。</p>
<p>谷正綱九日雖沒有出席第七審委會，但風頭却賽過每一個出席的代表，在國民經濟小組和社會安全及衛生行政小組，都以最多票常選了召集人，兩組爭了起來，謝主席說：「應請谷代表自己選擇」。傳斯年說：「谷代表是社會安全案的提案人，應被指派到社會安全及衛生行政小組」。於是社會安全小組熟烈鼓掌歡迎。劉振東以次多票補了國民經濟小組的召集人。</p>
<p>于斌推太虛法師　爲國大和尚代表</p>
<p>某記者詢于斌推舉太虛法師爲社會賢達代表之原因何在？于答：「這位先生很有政治智慧，且爲和尙中有代表性之人物，和尙在我國爲數可觀，總數的近百萬，　等抗戰時期曾出生入死爲國效勞，有太虛爲其代表後，彼等之意見，亦　賴以傳達。」</p>
<p>有詢以出家犬何必管俗人事？答：一渠雖已出家，然未出國。」言畢中國記者莫不大突。于主敎出語幽默，絕無傳教師習氣。渠本人爲國大主席團之一，惟自謙謂主席團之工作，僅爲替代表們看看鐘，其任務等於服務生或聽差。</p>
<p>國大代表滯朝英，爲于任舌人工作，于亦間以其東北英語作答，惟誤將英文「自治」念爲「天文」後，又亟予更正，招待會共歷二小時，所答問題近二十個，然最受人注意者，爲葉公超，關於政府派代表至延安一問題，記者於聽八宗敎問題後，聞此答案　振　　書，唯恐一字一句聽錯，　部長對派代表赴延事，拒絕有所宣布。某記者竹提出三個問題，渠皆不予答覆，並出示一小紙謂，一余另有一約會」言畢即　忽離去。（十二月九日）</p>
<h3>政府迄未關閉　和平談判之門　主席於紀念週上宣稱</h3>
<p>〔中决社南京九日電〕中樞紀念週與肇和兵艦起義紀念，今八時半在國府合併舉行，蔣主席親臨主持，並致訓詞，首述民國四年嚴和起義經過，繼關述此次起義，關係本。黨之革命事業甚爲重大，並稱，革命不怕失敗，須有再接再厲犧牲奮門之精神。主席對國民大會通日順利進行，表示欣慰，並勗勉各代表制定一部民主的憲法，完成制憲使命。關於國內問題，主席並稱，政府始終未關閉和談之門，且一貫主張，以政治方式解決云。</p>
<h3>于斌談制憲</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕國大主席團之一于城主敎，九日午後於中宣部記者招待會席上稱：目前之憲草，係融治調和各黨各派之意見擬成者，雖非最爲理想，然較五五憲草爲優，渠站在國足立場，對之表示滿意。</p>
<p>關於前傳田耕莘樞機主敎將出而組黨事于氏鄭重聲明決無其事。關於犬主敎組黨事，無論中外古今，皆無其事。</p>
<h3>鄧无量薛一冲　赴熱晉辦急賑</h3>

<h3>政府關懷越境華僑　請法方切實保護　海防設中立區已無必要</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京九日電〕外部發言人葉公超稱：中國政府僅承認越南有一個當局，即法國當局，中國中央政府並未與越南維明樹立外交關係，惟中國駐在維明境內之代表，有時曾與魷地當局有事實上之接觸。中國政府對海防·西貢·及越南其他處所華僑之安全深爲關切，已向巴黎外交部交涉，切實予以保護。若干日前中央政府曾向法越雙方建議在海防劃一明晰之華人中立區，法越雙方均不得利用該區作爲作戰根據地，惟以過去三四天來，海防局勢漸趨好轉，維明軍絡續退出該城，故中立區之設或已無必要。但以華人生命財產屢受損失，故對該一局勢，仍極爲關切。葉氏繼又舉出法軍政當局非法千涉西貢華商活動之實例，並謂：外交部已向法駐華使館提出交涉。葉氏復曰：聞法當局向西貢之華僑徵收人頭稅，而越南人並不負擔此稱捐稅，外交部對此項報吿正在調查證實中，蓋根據中法於本年在渝所訂協定，地方政府不能向華僑徵收多於越南人之捐稅也。關於滇越鐵路之談判，葉氏謂：根據協定，該路滇省境內部份，應無條件交還中國，移交之技術問題，已在研究之中。渠吾認中法談判因法國政府之改組而受阻，並稱；專家現正從事調查中國公私利益職時在越南所受之損失。</p>
<h3>蘇消息報撰評　攻擊中美商約</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科八日電〕消息報撰評人貝萊阜太洛，今日攻擊中美商的，指爲藉比章同美國在華經濟之支配權，並將中國置於美國獨佔資本掌握之下。據稱：中美商的係在國民大會開會前簽字，表示美國支持國民黨政府，並加强其外交政策之地位。此次召開國大，中共並未參加，美國統治階級希望中國由一黨政府立法，使美軍留駐中國一事，成爲正當，謂其出自合法政府之邀請。惟國民黨政府若不饗應中共要求，恢復商談，組織聯合政府，則中國之政治危機必將加深。</p>

<h3>月蝕奇觀</h3>
<p>— 臺北天文臺觀測記</p>
<p>〔中央社台北九日電〕今晨令時，台北天文台舉行月蝕觀測會。記者於初　前自赤道儀觀測器中觀測月球，目睹此被天文學家稱爲「荒涼世界」之月球中，有若千粗礪不平之黑影，此即昔日之所謂海洋，今已改稱平原，於此大小不一之十二平原中，最大者直徑達二三零千米，四週皆有高山圍繞，而明顯可見之狀，爲白帶形之山脈，則有六條，最高者七公里，最長者六百公里，火山口多至一百一十二個，另有色較月球本身爲淺之放射錢。今晨天空皎潔，但至零時十分十二秒，月球因與地球相切而呈「初虧時月象」，即開始生變，東緣漸入盧暗，呈昏黃，繼而相切愈深，光度愈減。一時十八分四十二秒「內食開始，四周色藍而帶微綠，內層呈玫瑰及紅紫色，最內層呈深紅　而偏於月面。一時四十七分五十三秒，月球之位置行轉至金牛座與五車五星附近，月球中部掠過地球影軸，進入，食甚」，月球中之平原益黑，山脈及火山口均形隱沒，月面僅餘微光，色最淡，地面亦暗如朔日。二時十七分五秒，月球第二次與地球相切，東緣微自生光。繼而月象愈明，三時二十五分三十五秒，全部「復圓」，月球復呈原狀。據台北天文台之觀測，今晨月食之時間，與預測之時間甚相符合，然因受肉眼及儀器之限制，在科學昌明之今日，上下五秋之差度仍屬難免。依該台之記錄，此次月食亦即今年之第二次，月全食自初虧至復圓，共歷三小時十五分二十三秒，比較今年六月十五自零時四十四分開始第一次月全食所歷之時間，短少三十四分十三秒。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>郵電加價影響報業</h3>
<p>自郵電實行加價以後，各地人民團體頗有褶請政府收回成命的要求；其間從事於出版及新聞事業者，對此次郵電加價所業　之不利影響，尤爲深刻，因而呼籲之聲也愈迫切。據報載消息，首都各報以此次郵電加價，影響業務發展至鉅，迭經請求主管當局予以减低，迄無效果，特於八日召開緊急會議，商討應付辦法，決議：（一）請交通部另定新聞郵電付費辦法，在新辦法未公布前，仍昭一舊價付費；（二）電全國各地同業，採取一致行動，在未得結果以前，一律暫照舊價付費。同時，漢口市報業公會，亦通電全國，請求政府收回成命。此事旣發展到現階段，我們誼屬同業，尤有切身之感，自難安於緘默，因不得不有所論列，用爲京漢同業聲援，喊出我們共同的要求。</p>
<p>首光我們要聲明的就是對於一般郵電的加價，我們也相同的表示不滿。郵電爲國營的公用事業，公用事業之私營者已不准任意加價，則國營的公用事業日然尤其不應任意加價。這是基本的原則，以言政策，在現階段的經濟情况下，郵電加價不特未能解決郵電當局如今面臨的困難，抑　使此項困難更爲深刻，是則此項加似政策的採取，實無異於飲酖止渴。况且國家直接經營的公用事業旣爲加價，則風氣所播，勢必羣起效允，此共爲害社會秩序之平衡，影響允非淺鮮。所以棄原則而談應付一時的政策，加價亦爲非計。據報載郵政當局的宣稱；則郵資愈增，郵局愈窮。據稱：十一月份以前（而加價以前）全國郵政總收人的五十億元，支出一省三十餘億元，不數約八十餘億元；而自十一月增加五倍後，郵政收入爲一百另八億元，開支却增至兩百億元，較過去虧累增加的十億，而郵政員工待過却依舊未有調整。可見郵電加價未必能解決郵電的虧負。在此種情形之下，政府本可在國庫內特發專款以貼補郵電的虧負；但政府計不及此，而採取加　　策，原也有它的理由，這就是由國庫特撥專款來貼補郵電的虧損，勢必增加發行，直接刺激通貨膨脹，間接抬高物價上騰。這當然也是一積值得考慮之點。但加價的結果與撥款貼補的結果是相同的；其間並沒有什麼顯著的差別。</p>
<p>如今政府旣採取加價的政策，則此次郵電所加的價，實在似乎考慮欠周。國家爲推進民族文化的發展，對於書報的寄遲，原本予以特別優惠。此其用意深長，自有足道。其奈此次郵電加價，對於書報出版事業所受的影響，却至不利。中央日報爲此次郵電加價，前會著論，認爲這一次郵電及交通運輸的加價，竟不爲報業留少許生存餘地，實有竭澤而漁之嫌，等於以絞繩絞死報業。今日的交通當局，就要負阻礙文化進步的責任，就將是民族文化的罪人。此其論調，雖或不免因直接蒙受影響的關係而言之稍激；其動機却值得我們的同情。不過今政府旣採取加價政策以彌補郵電的虧損，則對於新聞出版事業自不能有所例外。我們現在要問的是：所加者是否爲合理；如爲不合理而隱含阻礙文化進步的，則自應籲請政府當局及早改善。</p>
<p>舉例來說，空郵所以縮短時間，以目前國內的交通情况而言，應該儘量設法利用；而郵政當局的指施，却似乎正與此背道面馳。航空郵交在不久以前曾增加十倍，此次郵資加價，又加調整，其調整程度的而且高，實在令人費解。航空郵寄本報一份，在以前加了十倍的時候爲二百七十四元，自經此次觀整，突增至六百廿元，且超出限重不滿廿公分者槪以二十公分一百五十元計。但航空公司對於運費的徵敢，在同時期內，卻並不會漲價，以上海寄至重慶每公斤四千另八十元，折合每十公分僅需着四十元，二十公分，需費八十元；而上海至南京每公斤七百二十元，折合每十公分衹需費七元二角，二十公分十四元四角。但郵政當局卻不問遠近一律徵收每二十公分一百五十元，即每公分七十五元，核與最遠程之重慶多三十五元，與最近之南京十七元入角。此項數字雖小，積少成多，也就著實可觀。是則此項郵資增加的核計，責在不無問題，就報業本身言，報紙寄遞，貴乎迅速；而郵政當局的措施，卻似乎在阻碍報紙寄遜的迅速。難怪各地同業，對於此次郵電加價，不免要情詞激昂了。</p>
<p>站在人民的立塲，同時爲國家著想，我們覺得郵電加價未必是解決當前困難的辦法，退一步站在報業的立塲來說，我們覺得此次郵電加價，對於文化出版事業，所蒙不利影響，實在太鉅。如果政府不得不採取加價政策我們要籲請他們不要摧毀文化的發展，而對於新聞出版事業能够有一種優惠辦法，至少所定的取價不能不有合理的規定，而不帶有阻碍的色彩</p>
<h3>美國煤礦工潮的觀感</h3>
<p>最近的美國煤礦工潮，兎起　落，全世界都狠驚異。我國自勝利以來，工潮澎湃，至今還沒有完全寗息。兩相對照，覺得有許多地方，可以發人深省。</p>
<p>其一，先從勞方說起，他們自始至終，步伐整齊，恪守規律。對於法院的判處罰錄，雖不無憤懣之表示，但除依法律手續謀取救濟外，並沒有其他越軌的言行，在罷工期間，更沒有包圍資方，搗毀廠礦，　　資本家等等粗野的舉動。等到工會領袖一紙通吿，聲明復工，所有　體會員。也都一致遵從，並沒有什麼異議，而且對於他們的領袖，也沒有發生何等不滿，或其他惡意的揣測。</p>
<p>其次，，是廠主方面，除掉靜條復工，或重開談判以外，更沒有絲毫舉動。甚麼破壞工會，離問工會分子等惡劣手段，在他們腦海中，似乎並沒有這麼一回事。</p>
<p>再其次，是政府方面，其解決途徑，完全側重在司法方面，一以法律爲依歸；連總統一知　向工人的直接呼籲，也須等潤最後的關頭，方才決定，而且始終沒有發表出來。一度曾團勞資雙方，已在暗中進行談判，政府竟宣稱不知道。原來美政府的觀點，咪是認定這次罷工爲不合法，所以一面努力從法律上糾正其錯誤，一面通令全國，嚴格節煤，以期持久。至於一切強力手段，例如捕人，封工會等等，連一句空言也沒有聽到。</p>
<p>再其次，是一般民衆方面，因爲煤是切動力的來源，也是家用和廠用的主要燃料，自然表示狠焦切的態度，同時對於魯易斯的剛愎態度，顯示着相當的憎惡。這次，魯氏忽然轉舵，改變方向，未始不是受到一般與論督促的緣故。介是除掉興論督促以外，我們所聽到的，也只是測應政府，普遍地節煤節電，準備渡過這惡劣的遭遇，無論對於工會，對於政府，都沒有其他隨外的指摘。至於一般受缺煤的影響而儀式關廠的人，更是靜悄悄地，齊等着工潮的解決，工人如此，廠方也未當不如此。</p>
<p>現在事情已過去了，美國人大家已深深地透了一口氣，我們處在遠東，當然更不用重提這些往事。如今重提這些往事，因爲在工潮澎湃的中國，似乎過去這些形形式式，狠够得上耐人尋味。試想這種大規模的，全國性的工潮，如果發生在我國，而時間又延長到兩句之久，其情狀該是怎樣？在這期間，勞資雙方，曾不會發生其他的枝節，政府方面，會不會悉遵法律軌消，不採取其他緊急的措置？一切節煤節電的辦法，能否現現成成地，頓時展開到全國？一般民衆，又能否響應政府指示，一致節煤節電，靜候司法的判決？所謂第三者，會不會烘托煊染，做他們題外的文眾。</p>
<p>民主和法治的要求，現已達到了最高潮，但是「名者實之實也」，有其名須要副其實·我們看到美國這一幕「該人聽聞」的工潮，不但於歷次工潮的情形，發生無限感觸，便是要實現民主，要實現法治，似乎也不單是喊喊口號可以了事。無論在政府，在勞資雙方，乃至在民眾，在第三者，必須要恪守法紀，明辨是非，實事求是地各盡己責，方不至出軌到岔道上去。</p>

<p>高生大一店員陳情</p>
<p>高生大紙號，被燬經過，各報雖已記載，大多語焉不詳，以誤傳誤，筆忝爲司賬，服務該店已達廿九年，店主之爲人，恩威並施，小主人高鵬雲又和靄可親，現在同德醫學院五年級求學。外界所云巡官者，都是無中生有，惑亂聽聞，查上月卅日午十時，黃浦分局門前，聚集攤販數百人，要求釋放被捕攤販，未得要領，於是愈聚愈雜，竟有千人以上，黃浦分局見勢不佳，乃用救火車澆水，衝散結俁，但竟有部分羣衆，非但不畏冷水，更且有人以石子亂擲驚察，鄰近商店覩狀，恐遭意外，咸均打烊，即本店亦上牌門。當時店主不在店中，筆者當時約束同人，不許出外，恐遭危險。詎料六時左右，忽聞有人競，高生大澆水，一唱百和，大打店門，警察趕到，衆人退去。筆者上樓調查並無其事，乃下樓至大門前，高聲解喊破喉嚨，充耳不聞。警察退去，若輩復來，遂將本店牌門玻窗完全打毀。繼而衝進店內，將印刷機器，賬櫃，櫃破毀，並以貨物拋鄭門外燒燬，下午七時燒至十一時爲止。當時損失，難以估計。本月一日，打竹籬笆，以防宵小，不料下午三時搗亂份子，又將鐵器及鑄石，拋打　上玻璃窗。本店同人並不聲張，聽其自然。豈知將籬笆拆毀，衝進店內，固人等恐遭損害，咸均逃避。其時高鵬雲小店主，不願離店，跪地哀求，希望得彼等諒解。不但不聽，險遭不測。又將貨樓上之貨物，完全搬出燒燬，三樓上夥友之被褥衣箱，亦被波及，損失之鉅，大約千萬元之數。店中損失，目下估計二萬萬元以上。筆者現年五十二歲妻年較大，旣無伯叔，又鮮兄弟，更無子姪，在高生大服務廿九年中，所積蓄者，價值二百餘萬元之依服及金飾，今被暴徒搶刦一空，旣不能向店主索償，更不能向父老兄弟　姑姊妹索取，然半世辛勞，付於流水，言之能不傷心！懇求！各界同情，救濟店主，即救濟同人，得能早日復業，早日安定，爰將經過事實，並鄙人可憐苦衷，實之報端，亦可競筆者數十年來，一頁傷心史也！（趙夢龍）</p>
<p>異哉！調查戶口？</p>
<p>松江縣永豐鎭倉南門附近，駐有跨塘鎭自衛團，於本月四日晚七時左右，敝人自申返里，先至親戚家，當時內人亦在，不料外面有擂戶之聲，連喊開門，其時吾親戚等不知何事，恐慌異常，但無法祇能開門，見係若輩携有槍械，毫無禮貌，衝入門內·口稱調查戶口，當時我心坦然，不料他查閱身份證，當時我說明在報館服務，示以證章，彼强說冒充，辯論多時始悻悻而去，試問他調查戶口，旣無戶口册，又無郷保長同往，而服裝不整齊，聖堅明當局，從速查明此種突擊式之戶口調查以維治安。（莊永章）</p>
<h3>蕪湖－一切經不起試騐　皖省重心所在地的透視</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者柏毓文</p>
<p>安微省政府雖然設在合肥，却不過僅僅是省政府所在地而已，全省經濟政治重心，仍舊着重在蕪湖。皖南是安徽全省的富庶區域，每年有千萬石以上的糧食由蕪湖出口，換得大量的鈔幣貨物，由蕪湖再分散到整個的皖南各縣，它是安徽的呼吸的大氣管，加着濱臨長江的中流，江河輪船和鐵路公路的四通八達，地勢上形成了地位益趨重要，安徽人愛蕪湖，更重視蕪湖，現在的蕪湖究竟怎樣呢？</p>
<p>建設</p>
<p>淪陷期中暴怪戶太多了，而且在敵人侵入蕪湖的時候，沒有什麼大戰，破壞的程的程度遠較湘桂差的遠，中山路正路二街馬路，新型的建築比戰前的確增加了不少。勝利之初，新來的官吏和名流，對建設特別感到與趣，勝利的國家，需要勝利的裝飾，自然是對的，開闢偑量區的環塘馬路，建築中山紀念堂，行人道上栽洋樹，幾萬萬幾萬萬的支出，雖然上海南京人乍到蕪湖仍覺得狹小的可憐，但自內地來的，在馬路上蹓躂，看到霓虹燈，聽到收音器，以爲上海也不過如此。第六區行政督察專員張威遐，其始兼了市政　備處主任，以是蕪湖市政的建設，張氏是有永遠不可磨滅的功績，許多建築上有他題的字，環塘路並日已定名爲「威遐」路了。可是天要永遠的不下雨，馬路立時變成插秧的水田，上二街的馬路兩旁，有好幾天可以漂弄模型的小船，兩旁的店戶人家，變成秦淮河的花船，大家搭起跳板方向上岸。聾子也有耳朵，耳朵的名稱以及配配樣子仍舊有點作用，那末蕪湖的行人道，做聾子的耳朵終歸還有資格，行人道寬的地方也有二三尺，窄的地方大槪只有一市尺，就在這狹隘中間，還得種上行人道樹，假使人能同蛇一樣蜿蜒而行，到也嘸啥，有些樹正好栽在店舖大門正中，要是不留意，從屋裏一直向外衝出，正好迎面和樹相碰。中由紀念堂落成不到數月，代價一萬四千餘萬，現在漏雨了，要倒了，參議會爲此曾提出嚴厲的質詢。中山橋在去年京付出數千萬，現在仍未動工，包工的人跑了。這些都是建設，不管有益無益，即使有壞處，別的地方旣是這樣做，我們也這樣做，總不算不肯做事就是了。</p>
<p>治安</p>
<p>什麼時候穿什麼衣服，須知什麼事情，天生有一定規例，夏天防疫，冬天防盜，官方以及紳董，都認爲是中心工作。蕪湖未在冬防以前，盜匪不識時務，大肆橫行，大槪也就因爲不在冬防範圍之內吧，很少有人聞問，冬防時間早已到了，大家似乎都全神貫注到防範盜匪了，驚心動魄的驚報，每晚總要拉上幾次，表示是冬防戒嚴。盜匪偏偏不講理，昨晚才六點鐘，人烟稠密的長街上，文富山房書莊德，突然各行政進三匪，劫財未遂，公然開槍，將該莊店主黃幼泉擊死。前晚八時，中山紀念堂在放電影時，看客有一部份學生，與電影院打了起來，同時有人家做喜事放鞭砲，兩下一凑，以爲出了大事，先放了一次警報，軍警四處出動，宣佈臨時戒嚴，馬路商店，莫名其妙，紛紛關大門，行人也惶惶然往家奔，鬧子幾個鐘頭後，才知道是虛驚一塲。</p>
<p>商市</p>
<p>蕪湖是長江通商碼頭，險中，中交，農，上海，實業，省，縣八家銀行外，違法的錢莊也有六十餘家，百貨店布店特別多，播音器唱的連汽車來都聽不見讓，樂隊在店舖的窗口，大街上拼命的吹打，蕪湖人大槪太多愛好音樂了，做生意宣傳用樂隊，做喜事用樂隊，做喪事用樂隊，開會用樂隊，開幕用樂隊，書記長調職用樂隊，送禮送　用樂隊，時時刻刻在吹打中，蕪湖表面上眞好象是極樂世界。可是你同商界中人談談，看看報紙上清理賬目的廣告，以及債務的糾紛，整個的商塲，已在崩潰中，除極少數以外，都靠高利貸在支持門面，殘冬一過，春節後預料到能上市的商店恐怕不及三分之二，蕪湖最大的聯合商塲，如大華，國貨公司內的商店，紛紛到閉，只剩三四家，冷清清的門可羅雀，國貨公司已在出售房產，清理債務，昨天居然有債權人强行將該公司封存的貨物搬走，以致於涉訟。物價天天漲，影響到工資，工商業的生存感到至魘威脅，失業的人時有增加，臨時的救濟和冬振，不能解決這嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>蕪湖的一切，經不起試騐，　胖子終經不起一擊，過一天是一天吧！誰都存着這種心情在生活，在期待。（十一月二十八日）</p>

<h3>顧維鈞演說支持印度　南非不應歧視種族　聯大採納政委會決議由兩國談判解決　調查駐軍案討論無結果</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約八日專電〕我首席代表顯維鈞頃表示，中國將竭力支持印度對南非虐待印人之控吿。顫氏於大會中投票贊同敦促南非遵守聯合國憲章義務，不得有種族歧視行爲之決議。按渠指稱，此事在若干方面雖僅爲法律上問題，然其實際則爲一極重要之政治問題。此兩聯合國會員國間之關係，不但遭受損害，且完全遭受阻碍。渠言及此兩國問淸勢之嚴重時稱，聯合國應負責立即處理此事，並稱，南非之歧視法律，非但施行於印人身上，且對全亞洲國家包括中國人民在內皆施行之。又謂，中國之贊助此項決議案，並非因與中國本身有關，而實僅因中國爲聯合國會員國故也。顧氏於論及南非建議將此事提交新成立之世界法院辦理時稱，此舉可能發生不幸後果，蓋因（一）如該法院認爲聯合國對此事有管轄權，則聯大會又不得不處理此事，遂使間題拖延。（二）如該法院認爲此問題係南非國內事件，則未能有助於問題解決，而使印度不滿。（三）該法院如意見紛歧，則將使其失去聲望。顧氏發問稱，吾人以如此重負置於世界法院身上是否公平？在此前曾有十位代表，對國際上於此事是否有法律上之義務，表示懷疑。顧氏答稱，中國代表團根據一九二六年開普敦協定，認爲國際對此事應有美務。又稱，則撇開此事，任何國家如曾簽字於聯合國憲章，即負有國際義務。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社弗魯辛草原九日電〕聯大今日舉行全會，當以卅二票對十五要之狀定多數，採納政治安全委會則於南非與印度爭執之決議案，另七票棄權。核案規定印度與南非常就南非境內印度少數民族之待遇問題，舉行直榜談判，而於聯大下屆會議時提出報吿，確保南非印人所受之待過與兩國間協定條文及大西洋憲章之原則相符。先是，席間對於南非總理史末資提出之修正案，發生辯論。史氏要求以此案提出海牙國際法庭仲裁，決定聯大會有無權力干涉一個會員國之內政問題，英代表蕭克洛斯緊決予以支持。蘇聯代表維辛斯基駁稱：「此案絕對爲國際性質，因爲此舉違反兩個獨立政府問於一九二七年及三二年分別簽訂之單獨協定，該項協定保障對方之移民，此案之不能歸入司法問題，至爲明顯。南非政府歧視印度人之行動，不一而足，起先諉稱此輩爲猶太人之流，此刻在道義上失敗，又以法理問題爲口實矣」。至是，印度代美班迪特夫人起立，質問蕭市洛斯，國際法庭之判決如何的東常事者夫人稱：「蕭先生在辯論印度少數民放問題時，攀附印度國內現狀，此種諷刺與問題本身風馬牛不相及。再者印度之現狀，英風應負其大部份責任，應請蕭先生注意及之。吾人深知全世界尊重人權，正義與忠實，普天之下，均爲能厭迫者之友人」·史末資之修正案最後被以廿一票對廿一票否決，另二票棄權。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約九。廣播：聯合國大會日討論各國兵員調查問題，英代表主張建立檢查制度，調查各國所呈報之數字是否準確，莫洛托夫表示反對，據謂，各國對於國外軍隊問題，不應與國內駐軍問題混爲一談，雙方激辯，毫無結果，改今日再行討論。</p>
<h3>政治小組通過決議　對弗朗哥政權絕交　馬德里示威表示對聯合國抗議</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖九日電〕關於拉丁美洲五國對於西班牙問題所提之修正案，主張聯合國與弗朋哥斷絕外交關係，昨由政治及安全委會小組會以十一票對六票予以通過，委內瑞拉·南斯拉夫·智利·白俄羅斯·巴拿馬·法國·瓜地馬拉·墨西哥·挪威·波蘭及蘇聯等十一國投贊成票，中國·古巴·哥倫比亞·荷蘭·英國及美國等六國投反對票，比利時代表棄權。至於美國所提之決議草案，則僅僅籲請西班牙人民組織「可以接受的政府，以代替弗朗哥所領導之政府。」小組會今日繼續開會，又以十一票對五票通過汰國禁止向弗朗哥西班牙採購糧食一項提案，另兩票棄權。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖九日電〕西班牙問題小組會議通過對弗朗哥政權斷絕外交關係案，英美曾竭力反對。預料該案在大會表決時，不能護得三分二之法定多數。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦九日廣播：馬德里本“舉行官方授意發動之示威運動，弗朗哥對民衆發表演說稱，西班牙不能容忍外國干涉西班牙內政。弗朗哥發表此語，適黨聯合國反對弗朗哥之辭論趨於白熱化之際，顯係對聯合國干涉西班牙內政之一種警吿。</p>
<p>〔路透社馬德里九日電〕巴塞隆納作有炸彈數枚爆發，該處靑年團總部房屋之正面被炸彈所毀。聞該城左派團體，已定於今日發動總罷工，以對抗政府授憲之大示威。同時馬德里方面抵抗運動份子則發表宣言，揭露長槍會員壓迫工人，令其參加　　弗朗哥之示威。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社德黑蘭八日電〕頃悉：以任强爲基地之伊朗政府軍，繼續挺進，沿途掃蕩，肅淸亞塞爾拜然省民主黨軍隊之殘部。但截止目前，尙未進抵亞省邊界。其他政府軍刻正在亞省東陲邊界「探索敵方陣綫」。此外，伊朗普選原定本日開始舉行，旋因警察未能及時開到，以「保護」選舉站，故現已宣吿展期。按新議會普選，將於全國各地同時舉行，（亞塞爾拜然省徐外）。但據政界人士猜測，普選在一星期內未必能舉行，全國各地選舉宣傳運動，均未開始，甚至在德黑蘭選民亦尙未知悉候選人名單。另一方面，亞省首府大不列士市長，則已下令各選民準備選舉、總理蘇丹納爲此特致電亞省省長耶維德，向其發出警吿稱，亞省領袖旣不准政府軍開入亞省，故大不列士即使舉行普選，仍將視爲無效。德黑爾電臺現仍繼續廣播，隨時揭破亞塞爾拜然之宣稱。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社輿黑蘭九日電〕伊朗內閣總理蘇丹納，昨夜初次宣佈伊朗政府軍隊遭亞省軍隊之攻擊公報稱：「亞省游擊隊集由於茄弗倫柯區（苗納特通大不列茲公路附近）向政府軍開槍。亞省領袖之行動倘威脅伊朗領土之完整與主權，則政府爲履行職責起見，當不惜一切代價。」</p>
<p>又訊：伊朗政府飛機一架本日在亞省上空投擲傳單，　請人民起而反抗亞省「民主政府」。</p>
<h3>共產黨在南美進行反美宣傳</h3>

<h3>印制憲議會揭幕　回盟代表拒不參加　英所提分省計劃招致非議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社新德里九日電〕印度制憲議會今日在憲法大會堂隆重開幕，以期實行印度獨立計劃之第二階段，氣象頗形壯嚴，惟回敎同盟抵制議會，故回盟七十五席空無一人。大會黨及小黨派代表二百二十一人入席時，會堂四週有騎馬與徒步警察警戒，不許車輛行人經過。開幕時，籠單於新德里天空已兩日之烏雲，豁然開朗，陽光普照。開幕後，大會黨黨魁克列巴拉尼行過該黨代表尼赫魯等人身旁，發表簡短演詞，介紹臨時主席辛哈，辛氏年已七十有八，爲議會中最年長之代表。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里九日電〕印度將於今日進人重要之一週，國大黨執委會定於今日開會檢討英政府於倫敦會淡結束後所發表之聲明。尼赫魯屆時可趕到出席，制憲大會一定今日開幕。同盟早已表示不擬參加阿　密州之國大黨出席制憲議會代表，昨暗示有若干國大黨人員亦將拒絕參加憲大會。彼等反對將印度各省因制憲日的而分成數組，若英政府之分省制度解不能撤同，則彼等雖有運絕出席制　大會。錫克族亦反對分省之議。某錫克代表稱　旣認憲法不能强迫一部份不願接　　人民接受，因此有分省之　　，但若一省之內，如　加布省，因有六千萬回敎徒願意某種憲法，豈能即行强迫一千二百萬之錫克及印度敎徒按受。查原來之建議爲將印度諸省分爲三類，根據五月十六日之英方文吿，各省於制憲完成後，有選　加人何一類省之權。國大黨則解釋爲各省起初即有選擇之權。昨交英政府之　明謂：此次解釋之不同應由聯邦法庭裁決，共決議應由雙方按受。據悉，國大黨已準備接受聯邦法庭之裁決。</p>

<h3>煤礦工潮解決後　美國生活入常軌　國會即將討論修改勞工法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山九日廣播：美煤礦工人今日復工，歷時十七日之工潮至此乃吿結束。</p>
<p>〔本報華盛頓特派員九日專電〕自礦工聯合會主席魯易斯對杜魯門總統表示屈服而發出復工命令後，此間常局靜待煤礦工人之反響。一般人對於迅速恢復煤礦生產量頗抱樂觀，但政府當局預料此次大罷工所引起之反響，將使國會法院及煤礦工人方面之糾紛久懸不決。據採礦區傳出消息：煤礦工人對於復工命令絕少表一示反對，大概係因本年內迭决罷工，煤礦工人巳損失八星期以上之工資。一般人預料煤礦將於星期一晨復工，但生產量須至星期三四始能恢復常態。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約八日電〕礦工聯合會主席魯易斯易向政府無條件屈服後，其要求增加工資運動已告洩氣。礦主方面現靜待政府進一步行動，及國會明年一月問是否討論新勞工法，受煤礦罷工影響之各工業則正謀恢復常態。賦閒工人三十萬名，必須等待煤斤接濟有着，始可復工。工潮結束後國內外各種用煤限制，實際均已取消，本屆聖誕節當可大放光明，商店可有更多貨物，公共場所暖氣設備亦可恢復，大件郵包將恢復遞寄。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華感頓八日電〕國會議員今日表示決心進行新勞工法之討論，但暗示礦工聯合會主席魯易斯之屈服，已打消最後嚴厲懲罰。</p>

<h3>八一三陰謀暴露　「宮崎事件」真相大白</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京九日電〕八一三事變動，日本曾揑造種種故事，以圖藉口發動侵略。當時有所調「宮崎事件」，曾輕日報崎一等兵今日忽由廣島鄉間聲明，渠仍健在，並稱，八一三巨禍係日軍藉口造成者。「宮崎事件」之眞相乃吿大白。據宮崎談稱，渠於一九三七年七月四日藉外出機會，決心逃走，潛入英船中，旋被發見，乃躍入江巾，爲中國人救出，帶往南京，未幾即見日文報刊登渠之照片，宣傳「宮奇不法被綁事件」。宮崎大驚，急往自首，乃被送同上海。日軍爲面子關係，不欲暴露真相，嚴禁發表宮崎歸還消息，竟以軍府物資櫝職罪名，將宮崎判處徒刑十五年，押送古島監獄服役。至今年四月始獲假出獄，刻在鄕里從事糧食增產。</p>
<p>白爾德上將南極探險隊隊員穿着之服式（本報特約紐約時報攝寄）</p>
<h3>人類的眼光轉移到南極　美探險隊作科學研究</h3>
<p>— （全眾社弗朗茲著　本報編譯室特譯）</p>
<p>面積的相等於兩個歐洲的南極和環繞在它四週的海水，現在已經變成美國廣大的科學研究試騐室了。</p>
<p>遠在海軍後備上將白爾德所領導的包含二十五個以上著名科學家和二百個研究人員（全除人員總共爲四千人）的勘查隊上船以前，一切直關這個「世界底層」可用的消息就已經搜集，整理分析完完畢，以供探險人員應用。</p>
<p>政府的許多科學處局均自行派遺人員參加此勘查隊，準備以後把屬於下列各科學部門，如電子學，海洋生物學，大氣動力學，醫學，礦冶學，冷藏學以及農學等之觀察所得，移轉到民用事業上去。</p>
<p>專家們認爲南極地帶實爲試驗在戰爭由所發展的知識和方法承平時期用途最理想的試騐室。南極的現象大都均爲至今一武與人類隔絕，尙未被發掘過者，因此利用飛機或是潛水艇從事的這項探險，實有推進人類知識邊界的功用。</p>
<p>以問題的範圍以及大量人力物力迅速集中的規模而論，除了過去陸軍完成原子炸彈的曼哈頓計劃以外，無有可與這次海軍的南極勘測工作偷比者。</p>
<p>數十年以前，兩極地帶的勘測工作，在水上全屬航海技術問題，在陸地則屬於人類耐寒限度的問題。地理的疆域正像用狗拉着的雪撬一樣飛速地推進。目前這六百萬方英里已知而積的邊緣，正以每小時三百英里的速率前進着。</p>
<p>這次勘測在技術工作上將應用世界上最新式最精細的飛機，螺旋推進機，雷達，空中攝影機，聲波測深器，雪地汽車，除去水份的食物，和空中測礦器以探尋未與發現的礦藏，</p>
<p>雖然現代利器有這麼多，大功吿成的關鍵還在兩個箱單古老的因素，即南極絕對嚴寒的氣溫中人手溫暖的保持和陸地勘測中在有些情形之下　　必須的毛狗的體力。</p>
<p>對於高空飛行，我們已經有了使人體和暖的特殊衣着，但是於極帶茲　機匠工作降雙手溫度的保持，至今猶爲一技術上的困難問題。</p>
<p>早期的南極探險報吿中曾言及大量烟煤的礦藏，和微量的銅·鈅·錳等礦藏。大規模的探索前此從未曾作過。當海軍南極勘測計劃第一次的非正式報告發表出來的時候，人們立刻便有了能爲它的目的之一在找尋鈾鑛的猜測。</p>
<p>冬眠期的美戰艦</p>
<p>敵寇屈膝，戰氛消逝，美陸海空軍方面，均是現此一顯著之現象。其在海軍部門，所有戰艦及商船，現已靜泊港灣，蓋入於冬眠期矣。船上大砲之類，一律均以可塑體之薄膜物密密包紮，且以樹膠層層噴射，嚴密封護，務使其歷久不朽。時機到來時，無一非有用之資材，是則冬眠之階段，殆即春醒之前夕耳。</p>

<h3>禁建區內新棚戶　明日起開始拆除　工務警察兩局解釋管理取締辦法　全市棚屋共有四萬餘戶</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政當局已決定於明日（十一日）起開始取締在蔡理區內建造棚戶，但舊有棚戶則仍准予繼續。惟如有妨碍交通，或架跨河浜等情，非拆除不可者，則將儘量予以出路使之遷移。明日起，市工務局將會同警察局組織一巡迴隊，由該兩局有關主管人率領警察，工匠，至各區巡邏，如遇在蔡建區內已搭未成之棚屋，則令工匠協助拆除，交還材料，令其在非禁建區內蓋建。</p>
<p>昨日上午十時半，市工務局局長趙祖康及警察局行政處長方志超等聯合在市府招待記者，解釋管理及取締新棚戶辦法，趙局長首先說明建搭棚戶之原因，乃由於房荒及軍民經濟問題，實則市府爲解決房荒問題特獎勵建屋，且准許棚屋建築，但須有限制，即以不妨碍衛生·消防·及治安爲原則。市府當局雖曾公布取締棚戶辦法，在執行時仍將儘量放寬尺度，但棚戶在禁建區建搭有增無減，目前包括前在淪陷時期搭成者，共約四萬餘戶。申請執照者二千七百零八戶，發給執照者僅四百六十八戶，餘皆爲不合法之建築。本市人口估計四百餘萬，爲保障多數人之安全，自不能不犧牲少數人之利益。而以夏令衛生，冬令消防言，此項棚屋寬有害全體居民，同時有少數人佔據公地或私有空地，蓋屋後作營業出售，更不能不予取締，此項決定曾於本月二日市政會議通過，當時市參議會，地方法院，法院檢察處等均有代表出席。</p>
<p>趙氏並報告發照手續業已改進，異常便利，關於營造執照普通一週至二週即可怪出，雜項執照如修理或建造棚屋等，五天即可發出。</p>
<p>方處長繼起聲明，警察乃代替國家責行統治權，依法令行使職務，絕無擅自行動。但警員執行命令時多少帶存硬性，希望市民切勿誤會。舉辦市政，必須爲以後施政着想，吾人不應僅顧到目前之水處，而影響整個計劃。現市工務局與警察局已聯名呈請市府轉佈地政局指定區域，供棚戶建蓋，在未指定前，對棚戶並不嚴格，已建者加以管理，正建者或初步完成者，則令拆除。</p>
<h3>江灣軍械庫　爆炸聲斷續　澈查肇禍原因　冒險進庫勘察　昨經掘出四屍均已焦爛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕後勤總司令部第二軍械儲備庫第一分庫彈藥爆炸，昨午曾一度安靜，負責當局開始積極着手善後工作，以撲滅餘火爲第一步，然後挖覓屍體，清查損失。昨日已發現之屍體計四具，其一僅剩腹部，又一尙餘下半身，另兩具亦均焦爛莫辨。</p>
<p>本案</p>
<p>發生後，首都有關當局極爲重視。國防部後勤總部特派外勤司專員雷詔傑少將來滬徹查，京滬衛戍司令部派毛森處長協助調查。昨日上午會同第一補給區富司令前往出事地點冒險進入爆炸庫內勘察，記者隨同入內，但見遍地彈片，瓦礫惟堆，地面熱氣仍逼人如灸。此時消防人員仍不斷引水內灌，工兵則開始控掘。當在倉庫南部發現燒燬之卡車殘骸一輛，及焦臭之屍體四具，咸信即爲當時接近爆發地點之運輸兵之屍身。庫內其他處所可能尙有數具屍體但因地面熱度仍高，爲避免危險，一時未能繼續發掘。截至傍晚止，尙未聞再有發現。</p>
<p>記者</p>
<p>復於下午往房後勤司令部副參謀長路際雲，據稱此次爆炸原因雖尙未能確定，但綜合各種報導則以手榴彈之不愼落地爆炸最爲合理。因據愛傷逃出之庫兵供稱，當時搬運浙江供應局第一供應站之三卡車手榴彈，係用列隊傳遞搬運法，彼等站立靠過倉庫外部，旣未放進閑雜人等，亦未見有任何異狀。驟聞轟然，即起豆禍。至有人認爲手榴彈不易爆炸，實則凡彈藥之爆炸，無非由於熱度達到相當程度而已。故整箱集整之手榴彈跌落水泥地面，由此引起內部火藥之摩擦生熱而爆炸，亦頗合情理。至於死傷人數，現可確知不如外傳之多。庫兵除有五名受傷外，原有七人生死不明，現四具屍體業已發現，成問題者僅餘三人矣。損失詳情則因火塲尙未能完全清除，故尙無確切數字可計。惟該部存有彈藥卷册，不日可詳實分曉。</p>
<p>又悉</p>
<p>富司令曾對記者等表示，擬於日內舉行蔡會招待本市新聞界，報告詳情及處理經過。至外傳有嫌疑犯一名被告捕等情，則迄今尙未能證實。</p>

<h3>仿造「抗幣」案　地院一庭審結　「北海銀行」並未依法核准　律師辯稱是否銀行值得研究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地院昨日下午開庭審理仿造「抗幣」「北海銀行」券案，提詢葉松茂，嚴炳水，楊培生，陸國樹，唐啓方五被告，一庭審結，定本月十四日下午二時宣判。</p>
<p>緣本年九月二十日，淞滬警備司令部稽查處在蒙古路二〇七號，破獲抗幣（北海銀行）印刷所，拘獲案犯五人，並抄出印刷機及模版等物。案發後，各方矚目，皆以政治眼光度之，中共上海辨事處周恩來陳家康等，乃立即發表聲明。嗣後警備司令部將該案移送地檢處，經該處偵查終結，提起公訴。起訴書載稱：被告楊培生之友劉劍清，韓福玉（兩人在逃），於本年七月間，自山東共軍佔領區來滬，携有共黨所設北海銀行發行之二百元券數張，因窮極無聊，乃楊培生商議，欲僞造北海銀行鈔票，運往山東及徐州附近共區使用。即以所持之鈔票，作爲模型，楊培生乃於同年九月十日左右，介紹嚴炳水代爲印刷，當先交付法幣一百二十五萬元，旋嚴炳水因款已用　，無法印刷，一面又受楊培生等之催逼，遂轉介紹葉範盛印刷所店主葉松茂（即葉範盛）代印，計約定印製該北海銀行券票面四千萬元，工資法幣一百萬元，但嚴炳水則向陸國樹詭稱爲二百萬元。計冒令一百萬元，仍由嚴炳水監印。所需款項則由楊培生担保，託其友陸國樹轉向知情之唐啓方借用，計法幣五百四十餘萬元，其紙張係唐啓方經手購買，由陸國樹，楊培生，送交嚴炳水轉發。印刷所用模版亦經陸國樹交由楊培生轉交嚴炳水，發交葉松茂備用。迨同月十六七日，已印就票面二千萬元，分四包，由楊培生及嚴炳水先後取去，交由陸國樹保管，並由劉劍清韓福玉於案發前携去一部（數目不詳），前往共區使用，案發後唐啓方又爲之隱匿鈔票，經淞滬警備司令部據密報破案。</p>
<h3>軍械庫死灰復燃　爆炸聲人夜又起</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江灣體育塲械庫，爆炸一晝夜後，至昨午始漸聲靜寂，詎至昨晚八時許，死灰復燃，又有巨彈一枚，轟然爆炸，以致再度引起災害，至十時許，曾一度沉寂，但至午夜十二時，又起爆炸，其情形之猛烈，更較晚間爲甚，隆隆之聲不斷，至今晨一時後漸趨沉靜。當昨晚再度出事時，江灣警分局曾致電消防隊，派救火車兩輛前往施救。</p>
<h3>對警備部筆錄　被告稱係逼供</h3>
<p>昨開庭受訊時，五被告除唐啓方較整潔外，餘皆衣衫襤褸，瑟縮站於被告欄內，在庭上詢問下，依次答供，皆否認在警備司令部之筆錄，稱係逼供。</p>
<p>楊培生稱：卅歲，山東人，住南市廨西路松蔭里十三號，賣香烟爲業，本年七月間，有朋友劉劍清，韓福玉自徐州來滬，聲稱欲替朋友印點東西，問有熟的印刷所沒有，我乃介紹予嚴炳水，由嚴興劉韓兩人直接商洽，事前我並不知係印刷抗幣。</p>
<h3>嚴炳水供稱　但知是冥票</h3>
<p>嚴炳水稱：卅三歲，寗波人，業跑街，本年九月間，楊培生對我說有朋友要印點東西，乃介紹葉範盛印刷所主葉松茂，我祇領其前去，由他們自己接頭，待印好後見是北海銀行鈔票，乃問是什麼東西，姓劉的回答是冥票，我乃問爲何不印冥國銀行而印北海銀行？劉答此是山東風俗，我做介紹人收取一成佣金。此次講定二百萬，先付一百萬，但我祇拿到十萬元。</p>
<h3>印刷廠主·貪做生意</h3>
<p>葉松茂稱：卅七歲，寗波人，開印刷所　祇四五月，此生意由嚴炳水介紹來，呌我水印，姓劉的同來對我說沒關係，你印好了，後由陸國樹拿來四塊模版，共印好二百元鈔五萬張，我得一百萬工費，嚴炳水興楊培生要佣錢，亦得一百萬，印刷機器我家裏有一部小的，不好印，後來印用的大機器，是由嚴炳水和楊培生車來。承印時我知道是鈔票，但這種票子上海沒有見過，我實在因爲無智識，想貪一點生意做做，請庭上辦得輕點云。</p>
<h3>陸國樹　未言先哭</h3>
<p>陸國樹未言先哭，鳴咽不能成聲。答時全身發抖，因緊張過度，致語無倫次，頻頻向庭上言曰：我講到什麼地方了，請庭上提我一提，綜其所述供曰：廿八歲，崑山人，住貝勒路恒慶里十一號，在大陸貿易公司供職，有一次在大世界遇見楊培生，楊稱有朋友要借錢做生意，我自己沒有錢，乃商之初中時同學唐啓方，由唐借出五百萬，言明利息二角，我賺一角，印鈔票等事我完全不知，葉松茂對姓劉的和姓陸的說不表，警備司令部乃捉到我，我是老實人，說借錢是有的，用作印鈔票經費之用，則完全不知，如今葉松茂所講，恐是他人所教，要咬我有罪。我自己無所謂，對不起的是唐先生，他借出五百萬，讓我賺一角利息，是存心挑挑我，到如今反害他吃官司，實在使我痛心云，言下又痛哭不已。</p>
<h3>唐啓方供稱　放款受牽累</h3>
<p>唐啓方稱：二十五歲，上海人，住東台路二七〇號，借錢是陸國樹說有朋友做單帮，缺頭寸，乃向我商借，我與楊培生等根本不認識，如今被牽累已被羈押八十多天，請求准予交保外出云。</p>
<p>繼即開始辯論，陸唐兩被告延請之辯護律師除對事實有所申辯外，並對檢察官起訴所引用之妨害國幣懲治條例第三條第一項，認爲不當，加以申辯。蓋起訴書所引用之主要法條爲僞造銀行券，根據案情，被告等對「僞造」兩字應受之無愧，但癥結在「銀行券」三序之解釋，「北海銀行」之毅立，未經中央依法核准，是則在法律上，「北海銀行」是否爲銀行，頗值得研究云。葉楊業三人無錢延請律師，由公設辯護人代爲辯護指稱被告籌之印刷鈔票實係僞造，並無背景。至此辯論終結，庭踰定十四日下午二時宣判，五被告仍還押。</p>
<h3>自緬遺歸　無辜商民　遣送尙無具體辦法　衣着單薄厥狀可憫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於英方自緬遣歸所謂「不良官兵」二百餘人，經警備司令部查明，大部均係無辜商民後，國防部已有電令指未將第弱遣送回籍，壯年編服兵役，並派兵役局第二處少將副處長余劍先來滬辦理。余氏抵滬後，上週末曾至警備部接洽，但迄昨日止，尙未具體實施。現此輩無辜商民，仍拘禁於警備部拘留所中，大都衣着單薄，值此天寒地凍，警備部中旣無囚衣，又不能發給軍服，僅能張羅棉被苦干，供彼等裏身取暖，狀極可憫。又悉其中有不少因原籍有身家老小，請求免服軍役而予遣送回籍，昨日即有滇邊負販十人聯名簽呈，當局已在考慮中。</p>
<h3>你每天產生多少垃圾？　衛生局長說是一·二磅</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕讀者，你昨天產生了多少垃圾？</p>
<p>你不要覺得我問得突兀，我的問題是有根據的。據衛生局昨天的發表是：「本市人口已逾四百萬，每人日產垃圾一·二磅。」</p>
<p>全上海每天「日產」垃圾二知四百噸，其中一千四百噸用駁運到三林塘，其餘一千噸用卡車·馬車·塌車·手車等運至郊區，填塞窪地溝浜。</p>
<p>現在清道夫共三二五七人。張局長說，「戰前公共租界每四百五十個市民即有一清道夫，現則一千一百餘人始有一清道夫。」</p>
<p>張局長還談到了「清道政策」。他說：「租界時代之清道政策，是業務第一，金錢第二。敵僞之清道政策是掃而不運，將垃圾堆置道傍，積壘如山。」</p>
<p>張局長的清道政策呢？是「經濟第一，工作第二。」下面是張局長給我們的統計：清道夫日掃道路二，二市里，月掃六十六里，平均掃一里得報酬一千三百八十三元。</p>
<p>垃圾夫每日搬運垃圾一噸半，月運四十五噸，平均運一噸得報酬二千一百八十六元五角。</p>
<p>怎樣可以提高工作效率，促進本市清潔呢？</p>
<p>張局長的報告說：「要馬兒勤跑，必要給馬兒吃草」</p>
<p>關於清潔問題的統計</p>
<h3>衛生局招待新聞界　鼓吹民族健康重要　受檢兒童三萬　健全者僅什一　醫師百餘人願免費診治</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕衛生局昨日午後四時，在市府該局會議室招待本市新聞記者，由該局局長張維報告民族健康之重要。現時歐美各國强國之口號爲「健康第一，兒童中心。」對於優生學之研究，不遺餘力。若我國再不急起直追，則前途何堪設想。故最近全國衛生行政會議代表，由江蘇省衛生處長陳萬里·浙江省衛生處長徐世綸·南京市衛生局長王祖祥·上海市衛生局長張維聯合署名，已上書國民大會，建議於研討憲章之時，在人民權利與義務章中，增列保障「人民健康權」一條，以建立我華胃億萬年富强康樂之基礎。並請各地國大代表，負起向人民鼓吹之責任。務使國人明瞭民族健康對於國家之重要。</p>
<p>經由防疫處處長陳邦憲報告最近該處工作狀况，謂冬天乃疫病之靜止時期，主要之工作在於加强組織，訂定方針，以準備未來。爲預防疾病之傳染起見，利用房捐中附加之防疫捐，添置大批垃圾箱，已製就者三三五隻，正加緊趕製中。此外如請公用局添置免費水龍頭，增加自流井等，務使明年之傳染病儘量减少。</p>
<p>繼由該局保健處處長報告促進健康比賽之進展情形，謂到目前爲止，已登記者有六九·五七〇人，其中兒童四八·七四九人，青年二〇·八二一人。而以嬰兒幼童參加類特少。然衛生局認爲健康比賽原以幼嬰爲主體，故決延長嬰兒及幼童之登記日期至十二月底截止，甚望本市之爲父線者自動前往參加。</p>
<p>迄昨日至，對加健康比賽而已受初期檢查者計三三·九七一名。檢查結果，健全無缺點者僅佔百分之十一。其中扁桃腺佔百分之二十二，痧眼佔百分之五十一，齒疾佔百分之三十二，皮膚病佔百分之六，包皮佔百分之十三，營養不良佔百分之二十。凡患上項缺點者，均可由衛生局免費矯治。該局該正分頭向各醫師接洽中，聞已有牙醫師一百五十一名，各願於可星期中抽出半天，爲參加者免費於治牙疾。此外，痧眼·皮膚病等，均將於明春積極診治。扁桃腺之割治，可望於明年春假進，免費代爲割治。又該局已自行總領有大批魚肝油精·奶粉等，將分贈於營養不良者。</p>
<h3>從事平民教育廿五年　晏陽初博士感人深刻　有條不紊地談痧推進情形　每一句話充滿了對人民的關切</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕「我國提倡識字運動，要求振興農業，提倡民主政治，都已經有許多年的歷史。但是，到了現在，收到了多少成效呢？無論是我們的政府或者我們個人，都犯了一個很大的錯誤－這錯誤就是我們沒有注意到基層。結果是主張雖多，而怪出這些主張的人們自己祇形成了許多小　子，與廣大民衆沒有發生關係。老百姓到現在還乎過着原始時代的生活！」</p>
<p>晏陽初博士談到了這種「捨本逐末」的風氣，不禁感慨起來。晏先生的頭髪中已經夾雜了不少銀絲，但他的熱情使他看來還是右面常年青。他井井有條地談着推進平民教育的情形，語聲是那麼清朗而平靜，每一句話都充滿了對人民的關切。聽到他這樣懇摯的教誨，我實在是深深感動了。</p>
<p>運用適當方法　才收廣大成效</p>
<p>晏先生說：「我從事平民教育已經二十五年。我深深的感覺到，我們從事平民教育的人，最要緊的是要發現種種可行的方法，然後把這些方法去教給老百姓。推行是要廣大的老百姓們自己動手的。老百姓並不是不肯接受新的方法，不過這些新的方法必須　佈三個條件：第一是簡單，否則他們就不容易了解；第二是切合實際，否則他們就不來聽你這一套；第三是必須經濟省錢，使他們樂於一試。</p>
<p>很多事情，我們頊要的不是金錢而是知識。譬如說，我們剛去定縣的時候，當地的天花和嬰孩的四六風流行得很盛。我們一方面爲他們治療，一方面告訴他們衛生常識，很快就收到了成果。所謂四六風，是因爲當地接生的時候不懂衛生，用不乾凈的剪子剪去嬰孩的臍帶，自然嬰孩就容易感受病症，往往在生下第四天或第六天左右，因痙攣而終於不救。當時我們去了之後，就在定縣找了許多年紀較輕的婦女，一方面教他們助產的常識，一方面就讓她們去轉告全縣婦女，以後支生的時候，一定先要把剪子在水裏煮沸了再用。行了三年之後，定縣就沒有再接生過一件四六風的病症。因天花致死的，也一個都沒有了。所以，我們就可以知道，我們到民間去，不是都要我們自己動手來做，而是要把各種適當的方法告訴他們，讓他們自己動去做，這樣纔能發動許許多多的人，才能收到廣大的效果。」</p>
<p>引起平民興趣　還是在有飯吃</p>
<p>目前怎樣推進平民教育呢？晏先生說：「目前國內未能安定，要大規模的做是辦不到的，不過現在倒正好養精蓄銳，整理教材，蒐集教具，使一旦要用的時候，一切都已準備妥當。將來大規模進行的時候，預備把全國分成幾個區，在幾個中心地點，先行示範，同時再訓練視導人才和師資，然後逐步推廣出去。需要的時候不必很長，四五年便可有顯著的成績了」。</p>
<p>怎樣引起老百姓學習的興趣呢？晏先生說：「可以用電影和戲劇來刺激他們？熊佛西·楊村彬·趙元任·孫伏國等幾位先生都是曾在這方面了不少力量」。「我們不單要呌他們識字，最要緊的還是要教他們有飯吃。吃不飽肚子的時候，你教他隨便什麼東西都不會引起他們的興趣。所以我們剛到定縣，就先教他們改良農植的方法，定縣是出棉的，我們初去時他們每年祇能做十二萬塊錢生意，幾年之後就一躍而至一百五十萬——這是戰前，一百五十萬是很不小的數目了。但是，後來發現這還不够，老百姓還需要經濟上的組織。所以我們又教他們成立了很多合作社，讓他們在運銷，購售各方面都能組織起來，中間商的剝削沒有了，老百姓得到了眞正的實憲。」</p>
<p>爐邊追憶往事　定縣實驗成功</p>
<p>晏先生興奮地說：「他們先改良生產，經濟上有了組織，我們再盡力推行保健運動，老百姓自然而然的便要求自治。他們不能不管自己的事，也沒有人能阻止他們管自己的事情。平民教育的最終目的本來就是平民政治－而「平民政治」也就是「民主」！</p>
<p>因爲定縣的實騐成功了，中國各地就也建立了民衆教育館和衛生院。也因爲晏先生他們重治「縣」的地位，因之這行政上的基層組織也受到了廣泛的注意，「新縣制」和「實騐縣」也就從而誕生了。</p>
<p>晏先生說：「當年清華，燕京，協和，金陵的學生，常常有到定縣來賓習的，學政治的就到縣政府去工作，學農業的就參加了農塲，這就是中國的大學生在畢業前有「實習」的開始」。</p>
<p>客室裏的爐火正熾，晏先生在菊影之中想起了定縣。「二十六年九月，我們旐被告趕出了定縣。但是，我們雖然離開，我們的方法却是留在定縣的。戰時，一位美國讀者參觀了許多游擊隊區域，他說：組織得最嚴密，抗戰中最英勇的，也就是定縣的游擊隊！」</p>

<h3>消滅棉紗黑市關鍵在民營紗廠　廠商不滿意管制辦法　設小組會擬具新方案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於如何調節紗布市場，消減黑市之方案，上週四紡管會例會時，曾根據各與會參員之意見，擬成草案。茲聞該案昨日送呈宋院長核定時，宋院長曾加審議一過，惟終以過去紡管會所擬之方案，各民營廠常有不予澈底執行之憾。茲爲貫澈整個之紗布對策計，政府決設法儘量供給購棉所需之外匯，惟實成民營廠方面，必須擬具一可資實施之方案，呈准宋院長後，即付執行。宋院長之意旨，當由紡管會吳僉主委轉達六區棉紡公會理事長王啓宇。</p>
<p>第六區棉紡公會乃於昨日下午三時，召開臨時會員大會，到各會員廠代表七八十人，由王啓宇主席。王氏當表示：政府已決意儘量供給原棉，各廠對所產棉紗之處置，當應善體政府意旨，似不能過分自由處置。王氏當提出四點：（一）恢復自由買賣。（二）恢復紡建掛牌制。（三）訂定各支紗標準價格。（四）各廠需要美棉，採以紗易棉辦法，以一包紗勿購一包棉爲原則。惟與會各代表，對王氏所提各點，並未同意。有若干代表，認爲目前紡管會所議定之管制棉紗辦法，實太拘束。同時，又認爲外棉之採購，應予開放，聽憑各紗廠自由採辦。至所產之棉紗，亦應由各紗廠自由運銷。如有出口，則所得之外匯，當可結售予政府，作爲補償。</p>
<p>最後決議，在自由貿賣之原則下，應兼顧國家經濟前途，抑平紗價原則，保全紗廠合法利潤及業務之發展，擬具妥善之方案。並推唐星海，郭琼，榮一心，劉靖基，陸子東奚玉書等九人，合組小組會，起草全部方案，該小組會已定於今日上午十時舉行會議云。</p>
<h3>金價昨已回落　美鈔略有頓挫</h3>
<p>烚赤昨初穩繼疲，最開二九〇萬有賣，上場時在二九〇萬左右徘徊不已，後以央行壓迫之下，實銷稍形觀望，自二九一萬五起勢漸回落，央行以二九〇萬之價，配給四七條，入後二九〇萬大關，終吿不保，多方亦有了結，無力再振，近午吿跌至二八七萬以內，午刻在二八七萬至二八七萬五之間徘徊，午後仍　振作，隔日交割曾升至二八八萬五而後仍吿下落，結果較上週六挫落一萬五，飾金卅萬〇四，紋銀未更，銀元微昂，暗拆平平，息價仍在一角二至一角半之間。</p>
<p>外幣港穩美平，美鈔暗市自晨初之五一〇〇元賣價起，午刻降至五〇〇〇元大關，午後仍在五〇〇〇元至五〇五〇元之間盤旋，結果較上週六微挫數十元，港票籌碼不多，形勢基穩，結果較上週六漲起二十元，港匯仍在九九〇元至一〇〇〇元之間，印匯一一九〇至一二一〇元，英匯一五九〇〇元至一六〇〇〇元，成交仍以港滙爲活，餘均沉寂。</p>
<h3>公債市況疲乏</h3>
<p>公債昨每况愈下，七樓某戶有一斬，人心倍形疲弱，乏人維持，統丙晨開一二〇〇元，中途步降至一〇三〇元，最後在一一三〇元至一一五〇元之間徘徊，結果較前收下降一四〇元，甲乙各跌一五〇元，統丁小一七〇元，統戊跌落一八〇元，成交的五百萬元。</p>
<h3>米市堅定　雜糧油餅平疲</h3>
<p>米糧南北兩市共到一萬五千石左右，銷路平平，南北市均早緊午疲，形勢欲振無力，北粳無所軒輕，南粳中關軟化，秈米則貨稀仍挺，白陰元亦平庸，暫時各貨無甚變化，黃豆本街納胃轉殷，回漲三五百至千元，豆餅汕厦閩均少成交，市價亦少上落，麩皮委靡不振，再跌一二百元，麵粉無出入，油市早市開盤仍然萎疲，午時店胃轉濃，結果各油均較週六無甚榮辱，小麥立定，粉市平站，綠豆南洋仍辦，市面活漢，生仁廣帮略動，價格回漲一二千元，芝蔴員稀堅穩，紅糧趨堅，蠶豆本街零化較暢，盤升千元。苞米靑島進胃甚食，奈申地到存兩乏，無貨應市，形勢則向高峯挺進。</p>
<h3>紗市平庸</h3>
<p>昨日紗市無榮無辱，二十支紗去化平庸，執貨者求售心切，是以續小一二萬，卅二支細紗有皖客吸納，價頗挺秀，布廠織成品、呆滯如故，致四十二支變錢銷淡市疲。</p>
<h3>保護調味粉工業　調味粉禁止進口</h3>
<p>本市調味粉業公會，因本國原有調味粉製造工廠之產量，巳足够供應全國各地之消費，戰前及抗戰初期，尙有餘力在南洋羣鳥一帶拓展市塲，乃最近受外貨源源進口之影響，營業銳落，各廠被迫减低生產，長此以往，整個調味粉工業有破產之虞，愛向輸入臨時管理委員會陳述理由，要求調味粉禁止進口，茲悉，該會上項要求巳接函復，准予禁止進口云。</p>
<h3>煤球居奇漲價　當局已進行登記</h3>
<p>燃料管理委員會，以本市煤觔黑市猖獗，影響民生至鉅，爲供應煤業需要，決定配售烟煤一萬噸，交由煤業聯配處統籌分配，聞該批配煤，本週內可出貨，連日家用煤球價格飛漲，竟達一倍左右，當局認爲實屬奸商乘機居奇，現已進行查究。</p>
<h3>證交試辦套利交易</h3>
<p>指定永紗信和兩種</p>
<p>證劵交易所爲套利交易成交便利起見，規定套利交易實行辦法，自本月十二日（星期四）前市起試辦，茲錄其規定如下：</p>
<p>（一）股票種　類暫定永紗信和兩種。</p>

<p>（四）叫價單位　實定一角。</p>
<p>（五）叫價方法　紙叫現貨價格與遞交價格相比之差額，例如八元一角，九元三角等等。</p>
<p>（六）成交價　格以當時現交買進價格爲根據，例如套利叫價八元成交，而當時現交買進價爲四五〇元，即現交偎爲四五〇元，遞交價爲四五入元。</p>
<p>（七）升降限度　以現貨價格爲標準，（限於雙方均爲套利之交易。）</p>
<p>（八）買買手势　以遞交之進田爲準，偶如買　現貨，　出遞交者，手心向外，賣出　貨，買進遞交者，手心向內。</p>

<h3>配纱历次有缺额　複配会分配时感觉困难</h3>
<p>第四期第二次配紗，複製品工業配紗委員會昨日（九日）已憑棉紡公會交來之表单，核配與該會所屬之九公會，今明兩日將由各該公會轉配與各會員工廠，據複配會消息，本期來紗，共爲四·七六〇件，照新比率折合二十支標準五·七四一件六一。距定額之六千件，計短少二百五十餘件，如以原比率折台，則短少允多，上次尙有短少之紗二百餘件，上星期棉紡業配紗會開會時，已議決補搜，而此次亦未有分曉，歷次退單十支紗一千數百件，疊經呈請紡管會掉補二十支大路貨，以合實用而補缺額，更無回音，棉初業每以歷次退單中有大路貨在內認爲無須補撥，但複配會則謂合用棉紗之有退單，乃極少數會員因銀根不及週轉之單獨行爲，並非總額之有餘，仍在要求補掉，未知紡管會究將如伺辦理也。此次各業會員工廠實配之紗，將較上期爲更少，各廠對於各該公會颇有責言，各公會負責人亦益感棘手，其中大路貨之二十支及四十二支雙股，允有難以應付之苦，據復配會負責人番士浩氏談稱，自支數折合比率改照新標準後，細支幾一律減至以前數次之九折，其總數接連二期各缺二百數十件，十支掉單又久久未決，各公會之困難情形，值得重視，已在檢具統計，瀝陳理由一，向紡管會請求增加配額，以濟眉急云。</p>
<h3>振济等五种公债　今举行抽籤还本</h3>
<p>財政部定今日上午九時，在仁記路七十四號中央信託局四樓，舉行公債還本抽籤，計有廿五年統一公債，戊種債票？廿七年振濟公債二三十年建設公債，第二期債票，三十一年同盟勝利公債，三十二年整理省債第一·二·三·四類債票，該部業經分函有關機關屆時派員蒞場監視暨執行抽籤，並歡迎各界人士參觀云。</p>
<h3>火柴业的两大危胁　走私货太多捐税过重　近来正在计划打开华南销场</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市所產火柴，除供應本市及京滬區外，外銷向以華北區爲主，惟近來正在计劃華南之銷塲，數量則尙未有具體決定。最近本市火柴之生產量，據有關方面之表示，較二三月前並未有顯著之增加。目前我國火柴業最大之威脅有兩：（一）走私品甚多，海關之取締收效不大，財部現對此事頗爲重視，已由貨物稅局轉知火柴業公會搜集走私資料，詳盡呈報以供參考。（二）租稅負担太重。例如以貨物稅而言，棉紗之稅率不足百分之十，而火柴則爲百分之二十；蓋財政當局視棉紗爲必需品，而火柴則認爲大部用以點燃香烟，列爲奢侈品之故。又如三十四年度撥派之所得利得稅，高達一億五千萬元，但據該業中人吿記者，實際利得尙不足一億元，依此推算，稅率竟高至百分之一百五十以上！故火柴業現正醞釀一減現之请願，不久可成事寶。至於以整個火柴業而論，大廠情况尙佳，且開本市某大火柴廠將以巨資購買在靑島之敵僞火柴廠；小廠則維持不易，視年關爲難關云。</p>
<h3>茶市交易清淡</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，英商出口行對於高檔陳祁門昨仍需求，惜貨稀供缺，故市勢造成僵擯狀態，交易寥寥無幾，價格方面，則猶站住，一他若無色平水新大帮，美國雖亦注視，但給價咸不稍鬆，出口久居寂寞，日前本市茶商會一度致電海外請求加價，結果石沉大海，杳無音訊，依現狀觀察，華茶美銷暫時難以開展，至於向銷非一洲摩洛哥等地之抽珍·珍眉等綠茶，低檔貨脫手依然不易，品質優良者，國內外售價既高低不一，復因船隻缺乏，邇來情況亦甚清淡，各綠茶內銷仍未見甦醒，瞻望趨勢，頗有搖搖欲墜之象。</p>
<h3>紗布南運數額核定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舫管會本月份核定紗布南運之數額，計紗本爲二九六七件，布本爲七五六四七疋。茲以上月份尙有申請後之餘額紗八三四件，布八五八六疋，故合計本月之甫運數額，紗爲三八〇一件，布爲八四二三三疋。各廠商之通知書，今可發出。接到後即可開始申請云。</p>
<h3>存棉登記完畢</h3>
<p>紡織管理委員會之存棉登記，自上週開始辦理以來，各絲廠花號暨洋行等，具報登記業已完畢，當局對紗廠業將來所需要之原棉總數，央行總栽貝祖詒，暨束雲章等，今晨十時許，特往謁宋院長，報吿存花登記經過，對於今後開放美樓外匯，以解決原棉問題，作重要之會商，爲時頗久，又通日金價激漲，宋氏對此亦頗注意，向貝氏垂詢抑平金價之近况頗詳。</p>

<h3>工商業不景氣　華股市況蕭條</h3>
<p>華股昨人心渙散，環境不利，殘多無意留戀之下，交易稀少，易跌難漲，晨開各股微挫，開後滿目悽涼，七〇號一九八號一八六號二〇七號三六號均售，一時代過於求，逐步下降，十時十五分後，逢低有一一〇元四七號等金融帮套利，稍形穩健，惟一八六號力售美亞永紗，八九號空方力壓，中途雖有二一五號二一一號不時力購，大勢難挽，後以一五七號將中絲售至跌停，一四八號亦費美亞跌停，人心更怯，十一時半後，三五號一九六號售現永紗，一八六號一五一號八九號二〇七號來售遞永紗，臨收最見處疲，結果較上週六計永紗美亞信和景福新光勤興跌一成左右，華豐跌半成，冷股大通微升，中紡微挫，中絲跌至停限，五和尙平，餘跌半成至一成不等，遞交美亞信和跌一成以上，永紗景福新光跌一成，勤興華豐降半成，午後承午前餘風，上場再虛，美亞首先跌停，永紗曾破四〇〇元大關，低後經七〇號等稍補，盤旋而穩，臨收時因冷股漸露秀氣，而被帶上，統益在臨收時竟漲起五十元，最爲生色，結果較上週六計永紗景福跌一成弱，華豐跌半成，美亞信和新光各降一成强，冷股統益獨升一成，大通徽升，中絲午前跌停，中紡微降，餘跌半成至一成不等，遞交永紗信和景福新光各跌一成，美亞跌一成半，動興華豐降半成，場外各股再吿下跌。</p>

<h3>牌價與黑市相差太鉅　僑匯逃避爲數萬人　中國銀行正積極設法防止</h3>
<p>僑匯關係國際收支平衡，中國銀行，曾盡最大之努力，予以協助及便利，惟僑匯情形，並未轉好，近數月來，均在遞减中，八月份雖因外匯放長，稍有起色後，十月份又復下降，十一月份尙無統計，而以中國銀行之僑匯收入，不如十月份之多，目前仍在繼續輛變中，情勢至爲惡劣，據有關方面調查所得，香港廣州間逃避之僑匯，每月達一千萬美金，爲數之鉅，至足驚人，又據中國銀行之報吿，本年二月以前，僑匯收入，每月爲五百萬美金，三月外匯開放以後，即逐漸减少，現僅不過二百萬美金，相差五分之三，已成目前極度嚴重之問題，據悉：關於僑匯逃避之原因，經中國銀行研究之結果，不外爲</p>
<p>（一）僑匯快慢間題，但廣州厦門等處，與國外均可直接通匯，紐約匯款，最多兩天可到，廣州轉四邑，祗需二三小時，信匯最多不過兩星期十天亦可到達，電匯信匯，均已恢復戰前狀態，此問題已不成問題，</p>
<p>（二）匯率問題，政府所訂外匯牌價，爲三三五〇，而黑市則漲至五千左右，牌價過低，黑市太高，此爲僑匯逃避最大之因素，</p>
<p>而其逃避之方法，則寄托於美金匯票及港幣匯票兩種，第一種美金匯票，原爲美國甲鎮匯至乙鎮所用者，即係舊金山滙至紐約方能付款之匯票，現已流通於廣州市面，廣州人呼之爲通天昃紙，公開買賣，此項匯票寄到廣州後，除商人收購外，並有富戶扒進，前者購進之後，可審到美國作結付價款之用，此批商人所進之貨，全爲私貨，不能結匯，乃收購上項匯票付給，其價低於美鈔市價，美鈔市價如爲五千元，通天昃紙四千元即可購得，故捨此就彼，後者購進以後，可匯存美國，以致通天昃紙能流行於廣州市面，第二種港幣匯票，以之去香港拿現鈔，因港幣官價與黑市仍有差別，如不去香港取現鈔，廣州亦可買賣，此爲僑匯逃避之兩種方法，因此僑匯之逃避，與走私各方面，有密切之相連，中國銀行有鑒及此，正積極設法力圖挽救，正針對現在實際情况，擬具防止僑匯逃避辦法，關於港幣匯票問題，聞中國銀行已與中央銀行商定，按廣州港幣市價另訂官價收購至通天昃紙問題，尙在繼續研討中。</p>

<h3>譽滿陪都的香港拳王　蔣浩泉君拳賽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕月前一度拳擊比賽在熱後，近日已隨着冷風沉寂了。在中青，猶太的業餘職業兩番搏鬥時，誰也未曾注意到，有位鼎鼎大名的拳王，在做壁上觀。這位旁觀者，即是譽滿陪都的香港拳王蔣浩泉君。</p>
<p>蔣君今年二十七歲，江蘇常州人，身高一米七五，體重一百六十磅，他的體格發育得極爲健全，胸大肌，與肩頭肌，三角肌，二頭肌等均極發達，他會擊敗英國職業拳鬥家愛姆拔，業餘拳擊虎將台密依文思，裘惠根森，及美國春田體育大學拳賽冠軍白克勤等。蔣君不但西洋拳好，他的摔角，也曾弄倒幾個老手，他跳得好幾套踢躂舞，而且由港赴渝路上，曾奪得桂林游泳比賽花式跳水冠軍。今天記者去寶山路走訪，蔣君談話如後：</p>
<p>西洋拳除了肌肉放鬆與運用適宜外，最要緊是拳重與閃躲之靈活，英美人民長於拳重，而我國拳手長於閃躲，和外人拳賽時，我往往能取勝，此爲一重要之原因。所以中國學習西洋拳並不困難，略下苦功，即可輕易取勝英美拳手。</p>
<p>到滬後各中外職業學家，曾的我參加，並言每塲可淨得二百餘萬，但我預備參加一九四八年的世運會，所以示能因爲這一點小小的收入，而損書了我一生的前途。</p>
<p>現在我每天還在苦練，因爲沒有對手，只好假想敵人，而大戰十回合，這固然是十分苦腦的事，但我不能功虧一簣啊！　我想在元且前，舉辦一次業餘錦鏢賽，各位中外業餘的拳擊朋友，都允贊助，希望能够成爲事實，不過目前場地問題，尙未解決，已與市體育館商洽，但他們要以收入的百分之四十做租金，實在是一筆最大的開銷。</p>
<p>談話至此，記者辭出，歸途上默默的想；國內設備，營養，體力，與西洋拳的氣氛，遠不如他國，對道位極有希望的拳擊者，我們該寄予莫大的期望，希望在一九四八年的世運會裏，我國也有一項可以露露頭角。</p>

<p>於本月一日，先至七賽鎭，到達時，千餘請願代表，已鵠候車站迎接，一致高喊願意劃歸市治口號。下車後，由程視察接見請願代表，徵詢意見，並會同寶山縣政當局實地勘察。翌日前往閔行，由上海縣政府召集當地士紳，及縣黨部縣參議會各首長於會客室，舉行座談，交換意見。三日會勘諸　鎮，到達後即會同嘉定徐縣長，李書記長，巡視劇界地區，並由程視察接見請願代表，徵詢意見。各代表大都主張爲推行自治建設施政便利計，要求劃入市區。四日午前車往幸荘，與松江縣長，城區警察所長會談後，由程視察向到場代表千餘人訓話，並徵詢請願代表意見。各代表一致堅持劃歸市治，午後會勘華莊及翁板橋一帶。五日會勘三林，由倪縣長，謝書記長，薛區長，陪同勘察三林四週，程視察並接見民衆代表百餘人，一般民衆意見，與閔行情形相同。六白勘察大場，聽取民意，大場士紳王應游，商界代表姚軼羣，學校代表陳慶棋，人民代表陳福心，暨民衆學生二千餘人，集合二十四區公所廣場，一致要求願入上海市管轄，反對寶山縣治。當由程視察向全體民衆學生訓話，並接見各界代表，垂詢頗爲詳盡，後由程視察表示，決負責將大塲區民衆意見，呈報內政部行政院，靜候合理解泱云。</p>
<h3>各區簡訊</h3>
<p>第三十二區（真如）戶籍過錄，正副本及六種人口統計，業已全部完成，統計表已於本月九日上午送至民政處。</p>
<p>第六區（盧家　）調解委員會，業經遵照市府訓令組織成立，並已陸緻接到區民請求調解案件多起。本月五日下午二時，並在區公所會議室召開預備會議。</p>
<p>本市太倉路一四五號泰山區報社浚行之「泰山區報」，內容豐富，自刷精良。關於第五區內一切民政消息，尤爲靈通。刊行以來，銷數殊大云。</p>
<p>第二十六區（漕涇）區公所，本月六日上午十時，召開第二决戶政座談會。又該區第九保專任幹事婁震宇辭職，遺缺由區派潘松齡繼任，第十五保專任幹事葉靑因病辭職，由區派方啓德繼任。</p>
<p>第二十一區（新市）區公所，於前日江灣械彈庫爆炸流彈橫飛時，以該區第七·第八·第十二·各保接近爆炸地區，曾急令以上各保幹事，協同軍警及各保長維持保內秩序，情形頗良好。</p>

<h3>江西的西北角</h3>
<p>— 二日航訊　本報南昌記者劉藻</p>
<p>武寗，是故陸軍上將李協和先生的故鄉，他的原籍在縣屬的　溪鄉，先生的靈櫬，今春由渝運贛，遵命卜葬　溪鎭協和中學旁。</p>
<p>先生的革命功勳，是永古千秋而不可磨滅，靈櫬過潯與贛垣的盛大追悼，正是贛人對先生的崇敬，記者這次贛西北之行，在未到武寗之先，魷有一個宏願——晋謁先生靈寢，以示敬仰。但是，到達著溪那日·正是一個秋霞西落的晴大，行裝甫卸，即循土人的指標，奔向協和中學旁的一個小高地上，踏遍山頭，僅見沙堆一塚，前插「行人請止步」的小竹牌一方，初尙不以此即爲先生之靈寢所在，再詢土人乃悉一代功勳的李協和光生，即長臥於此。</p>
<p>縣城距箸溪四十華里，一日行程，過箸溪西行，人烟較密，地方安靖，但是，當地老百姓的生活，從菜色的臉孔和補綴復補綴的衣着，以及穿自鞋，頂白布的「孝色」標記上看，老百姓依然在艱苦困難中掙扎。</p>
<h3>文化重心武甯</h3>
<p>修江流域以及九瑞地區的政治文化重心在武寗，原因是江西第九行政專員公署所在地，與奉新挖取銀害案有關的康景廉，就是戰時的第儿區專員，現任吳希白，是個豪爽而愛詩詞者，在目前經濟，交通諸種困難下，主持此一地區的政消，確實非件容易的事，譬如：省方飭令督修由修水經武髯，而達永修的縣道，全長達三百里，省方僅是一件命令而無分文的補助，並且限令本年年底實行通車</p>
<p>他說：「逾限不能完成通車任務，是要被處罰，但是，又不能派款征料。餞從那裏來，料由何處出，苦死了專員，急煞了縣長！今日之官，難已哉」！</p>
<p>刦後的武寗，在市街上看，漸後元氣，尤其是敎育方面，較諸他縣，確確甚一籌，著溪有省立協和中學，縣城有縣立中學，振風中學，學生的水準與師資，都還不錯，有的學校，爲了聘請高明一點的專門敎員，自願付出「黑市津貼」，足證當地負責敎育者的一翻苦心。</p>
<p>但是，地方豪紳勢力，相當雄厚，如瓜源鄉的李姓，現有良田六千畝，杉山千餘嶂，一鄉的政務雜事，一姓包辦，還有接壤鄂境的鄉區，由於鞭長莫及，稱覇一方，縣長對之，徒呼奈何？</p>
<p>（上）贛西北農村，滿目荒蕪。（下）日軍盤踞安義時修建之縣政府，爲贛西北唯一完整無缺之衙署　（本報記者劉藻攝）</p>
<h3>刦後德安只賸五棟半房子</h3>
<p>刧後的德安，祇有五棟半房于，和三萬七千五百一十五個虎口餘生的老百姓。縣城的荒涼，不亞永修，當地人口的銳减，依據不甚完全可靠的統計數字看來，眞可怕，—德安在民國以前，全縣人口爲十三萬，民國元年九萬，戰前七萬，現在祗有三萬七千五百一十五人，現有人口中，還有一部份是豫豫鄂籍，他們火多數是民國三年因河南鬧荒與十九年能患遷徙而來，眞眞的土著恐怕不到二萬人，據說：德安近幾十年來人口的死亡率很可怕，過去十口以上的農家，很是普遍，現在連五口之家亦屬稀有，就是外來的豫鄂客籍，亦不例外。</p>
<h3>沒有棺材的葬儀　縣政府權充旅邸</h3>
<p>縣城鄭姓最近舉行的葬儀，在德安可算空前，弔喪的賓客，有來自京漢南潯的高貴，和鄉井隣里的親朋，大卡軍，吉甫普，西裝貴賓，摩登女郎，使殘破的德安城，點綴得現代化中國都市上的文物，應有盡有，常然是一樁盛大的喪典，出葬的「長蛇陣」裏，找不到棺材，原因是鄭姓的祖先早年逃難外縣病故，業已安葬，鄭母靈襯最近由渝運歸，亦正在途中。</p>
<p>但是，鄭家的喪事，却苦了縣長，外來的貴賓，雖然可以在主家吃到三五牌的香烟，坐着汽車猶如龜步的慢行送葬，夜宿的「　榻」，却成問題，祗好暫把縣府充旅邸，時苦連天的縣長，對這些貴賓的蒞臨除了恭迎又需應酬，正是在這個熱熱鬧閙的場合，恰遇江西政務考察團到達，亦以無旅館棲身，借宿縣府，並嚴厲拒絕招待，應酬，使得縣長左右爲難，祗好來齣「一個場面，二個作風一偕宿的賓客們互照不宣罷了。</p>

<h3>星子縣石頭·泥土都是名貴特產</h3>
<p>星子，是一塊山岳與湖沼地帶，縣城的背後緊靠着廬山，前面便是鄱湖，所以全縣的土地面積，十分之四是山，十分之三三是水，可耕的田土，祗有十分之三，以現有的人口六萬七千七百六十四人，去耕種僅有的田地，——六十八萬市畝，每年的農作物，尙不能自供自給，就以今年豐收的估計尙缺糧二個月，何况縣屬北部的七都圩，蓼花池的農田水利年久失修，影響耕耘更鉅，就以蓼花池而言，店山隘口，華林山，黃龍山，丫髫山之水，九十九汶匯聚在此一低窪之地——蓼花池，被淹的田畝在四千畝左右，附近因而影響農作的良田在一萬畝以上，池地的面積，達五十里，村莊八十七處，戶煙二千一百餘家，自雍正年間曾興工修濬，但以工程鉅大，迄未暢通，七都圩的圩堤，亦是東崩西塌，如鄱陽湖的水位高漲，水路被阻，那末，鑒花，七圩等地的水流，祗有四隘成災，現在全縣的老百姓，一致要求，希望政府給他們以經費與技術上的援助，若此項水利工程予以疏濬培修後，星子的糧食問題，不難解決。</p>
<p>金星宋硯，名貴瓷土，都是星子的特產，遊邀星子的人們，來到這兒，對於宋硯更感興　，買來做遊盧紀念，或是贈送朋友。但是，現在由於工價的高昂，一塊普通的宋硯，索價近萬，雖然責亮的石池中，顯現條爛的金光，購買的人們，絕得估量值價的過高，所以銷路不暢產量低落。</p>
<p>景德鎭的瓷器名貴，就是星子的瓷土名貴，假若是一隻輕薄而雪亮的名瓷，非　以星土，是不能製成入饗，這幾年因爲景瓷的衰落，星土當然隨而　潰。</p>
<p>現在，星子的名產—宋硯·瓷土，都走着下坡路。</p>
<h3>深圳血案目擊者談英軍的「自由行動」</h3>
<p>— 王日九龍航訊　本報特約記者成章</p>
<p>深圳一鄉民三日下午一時廿分在文錦渡中英邊界的華界內被英軍開槍擊斃的消息傳出後，翌日記者便由廣州趕程前往深圳去。香港小販王水祥被葡籍警察踢斃案還未了結，深圳邊界又發生了這個不幸事件。這一兩個月來，英國的民衆代表和工商界名流，不辭由歐來華，僕僕長强傳達不列顛對中華民族的好感，四引檠巨型專機在我國大城市來來去去，香檳酒也不知喝了多少杯，中英親善的老調也不知設了多少遍，假如事實說明是，所謂好感，所謂親善，就是大皮靴的猛踢和三〇三式子彈，則我們被欺負的，豈祗「羣情憤激」而已也！</p>
<p>龍鐘老頭訴請伸冤</p>
<p>記者趕到肇事地點時，那個無辜的被慘殺者還陳屍路旁，由我國警士荷着槍看守着。死者身穿黑絨的中山服，面部浮腫，子彈在右耳旁邊穿過，臉上血肉模糊，慘不忍覩。當記者向死者拍照時，有一個龍鍾老婦（死者的母親）跑過來哭訴，要求我們替他伸寃，說時搥心傷痛，令人惻然。死者是一個以水客爲業的天字第一號的善良老百姓，除老母外，還有弟妹各一，一家四口，都靠他兩手維持。但他竟無緣無故橫遭央軍開槍射殺了！</p>
<p>在我方警政與外交人員縝密調查與嚴辭抗議下，四日下午七時，香港英陸軍總部發表聲明，表示遺憾幷允負其全責。（編者註：請參看昨日本報）</p>
<p>我們中國人平常自詡會作「官樣文章」，但看了英方的聲明，英人的文章作法也實在不劣，可是花言巧語可能够掩飾鐵一般的事實嗎？</p>
<p>砰然槍響應聲倒地</p>
<p>深圳的中英邊界，以深圳河爲界，肇事地點的文錦渡，爲廣九公路連接英界的末站。從英界九龍乘汽車，過了這，就是國界劃我方在距離河岸約百公尺的地點，設有海關辦事處，一般商人（俗稱水各）每天來往甚夥，英方在河岸另一邊設有一個小營房，開搶打死一個中國善良老百姓張添祥的英兵，就是駐在那個營房裏。記者從張添祥倒地身亡之處，遙望對河，見停有架起機關槍的英國軍車一架，橋上交通如常，但來往行人稀少，似還多少留存昨天肅殺的氣氛。有一位曾在場目擊慘劇發生的關員告訴記者當時情形說：</p>
<p>「那件慘劇的發生，是由於一個小童引起的。當時那個女童攜有一大包麺粉，由英界過橋給英兵截獲。英兵不知怎的，便把小意痛打一頓。小童的時聲引動對岸的鄉民。英兵復隨小童之後進入華界，鄉民便大起鼓噪。他（那位關員）上前欲作調人，那個英兵（後來查悉，名呌麥羅伯脫，小尉階級（却强項的說：「在邊界一百尺以內，他儘可自由行動。」才悻然而退。他便返海關，忽聞砰然槍饗，那個死者應聲倒地。當時鄉民情緒激越，深圳警察所長林萬年和憲兵運長音愼趕來向英軍交涉，深圳圩鎭長袁志超在旁極力勸導鄉民，維持秩序，那不幸事件才不致於擴大……」</p>
<p>越界殺人　面目猙獰</p>
<p>記者在文錦渡找到後援會派往香港報吿的代表，但據港報所載，該代表報吿慘案發生經過稱；「粵寶安深圳邊界文錦渡英守軍士兵一名，昨日下午一時二十分，越租追捕手携白糖兩小包之年約十三四歲中國童子兩名，予以毆打，爲深圳整察所見，向之勸解，一時引動鄉民團觀，羣起交涉，該英軍即退返英界，繼引英軍若干名，登臨跨於兩界之文錦渡橋，向鼓噪之鄉民放槍擊殺深圳第九保鄉民張添祥，羣情益吿憤激，駐深圳憲兵第七運連長魯愼，及深圳警察所所長林萬年等聞訊到場查問眞相後，即赴文錦渡英守軍處交涉，但無結果。鄉民以案情嚴重，當日下午組織後援會，一方面請憲警看守張氏遺屍，以待檢騐，一方面派縣參議會秘書文煦華及鄭科長啓昌於當晚馳到香港，向外交部兩廣特派員公署報吿慘案發生經過，請向英方交涉。」</p>
<p>這個報告和上述關員的談話合併來看，並使我們明瞭慘案發生的經過，眼前閃出一副「越界開槍殺人」的香港英軍猙獰面目。這是中英合作的表現嗎？我們要問問艾德禮首相，同時就正於維護正義與自由的世界人士。</p>
<p>記者離開深圳時，忘不掉那個橫遭槍殺暴屍於途的死者張添祥，更忘不掉他的悲痛欲絕的老母和那些義憤塡膺的民衆！</p>

<h3>戰雲低迷　山東全貎</h3>
<p>— 濟南五日航訊　本報濟南特約記者何冰如</p>
<p>在此次頒發停止衝突命令朱到山東以前，膠濟鐵路經國軍打通之後，政府掌握中所有的市縣，計有濟南市·歷城·齊河·長淸·滋陽·聊城·　縣·昌樂·安邱·即墨·膠縣·益都·臨淄淄川·博山·長山·鄒平·章邱·昌邑·高密·曹縣·單縣·魚台·城武·定陶·嘉祥·鉅野·荷澤·濟寗·嶧縣·金鄉·鄲城·寗陽·平度·掖縣·三十五個，曾一度透露開叫景象，此後以迄最近，山東的局勢又轉入戰雲低迷的局勢。</p>
<p>這種局勢的造成，是由於兩個顯著的因素：（一）即停止衝突命令到魯之後，第二綏靖區司令官王耀武，立即通令在魯的國軍及保安部隊，遵令固守原防，停止前進，一直到現在仍在執行着，同時也發生出「寗挨打，不遠令」的口號，在部下兵員心中默念着，但是，人是有血氣的，打急了總要還手的，所以近來山東雖無大戰，可是小衝突，勢仍難免。（二）共軍在鎭樣有利時機中，確可能獲得兵員調補，充分佈置其在戰場上的自主活動。</p>
<p>再就此間政府方面所獲消息，關於共軍在山東的動態，確已顯呈積極大戰的跡象。共軍的將領賀龍，率部由山西經滄縣而到達魯北德縣，並召開冀魯豫第一軍分區軍政人員會議，決定在其區內實行廣泛的征兵征糧，組織担架·運輸·敢死諸隊，企圖打通津浦鐵路，劉伯誠的第一三兩個縱隊，及楊勇的一個第七縱隊，近五萬人，益以地方民衆團隊，共約近十萬之衆，現已開始在魯省西南部活動，且巳攻下鄄城，圍攻鄲城，金鄉縣城郊亦有共軍足跡，其目的係在阻斷國軍北上，爲南下共軍之策應。新四軍軍長陳毅一向在高密，迭與其魯中·魯東·濱海·各區軍政首腦集議，策劃魯東南部沿膠濟綫兩攻勢。近頃新增兵力，計有「解放聯盟軍」第一·二·三·三個軍，業由魯西南沿山區開入沂水，準備參加膠東戰事，其原有解放第四·五·六·九各師，及警三警五各旅，則散駐於膠縣·高密·淄川·博山，及掖縣等地國軍外圍地區，其解放第七師自攻下齊東以後，仍在小淸河北岸地區活動，至於魯省濱海·烟龍各海口，仍不斷有共軍兵員及械彈補給船隻。國軍在山東現情况下，實陷於共軍四面包圍中，而感受到拘滯。</p>
<p>最近共軍更準備將魯東南半壁，劃成三個軍事中心地區，即以膠東之高密爲中心，企圖切斷膠濟鐵路，再度恢復其交通走廊。魯中方面，則以淄川·博山爲中心，目的在奪取淄博礦區，並與其魯南山岳地區之根據地相呼應。此外，則集中兵力，相機與國軍爭奪濟南，以動搖政府在魯之軍政重心。本月四日，又有一部共軍萬餘人，由萊蕪出動，進至泰安·歷城邊境之西營地方。距濟南市祗五十華里，目的如何，尙待事實證明，但不能不說濟南感受威脅。</p>
<p>目前整個山東局勢，已到了戰機四伏的階段，劇戰似有隨時隨地爆發的可能。不過一方是遵守停戰命令，不能開展，一方是自己迭受打擊，估金實力欠充實，尙有所期待。至於國共兩軍，似均側重於魯東膠濟鐵路沿綫，蓋國軍目前情勢，係以確保膠濟路交通爲有利，但國軍始終能保持此有利條件，則共軍即永遠無走廊，其與東北以迄蘇北魯南，海陸運輸之連繫上，均感覺不靈，是將來雙方必以死力爭奪之焦點。如將來國家整個大局能有辦法，低迷的戰雲，常可逐漸消逝。</p>
<h3>凄涼的寶山</h3>
<p>— 三日訊　仲英</p>
<p>賽山城內蕭條得沒有什麼商業，所謂最精華的西門大街，白天很少人走，晚上更如死一般地冷寂，我們在街上孤獨地走着，只看見到幾家半關門的小飯館和烟紙店，他們要買衣料·文具·日用品，必定要遠遠地跑到鄉下去買，因爲鄉下的市鎭，却比城裏熱鬧得多多這不是一個怪現象嗎？寶山並沒有娛樂場所，只有一爿小茶館，坐着十外個人，在那裏聽著雙珠鳳的彈詞，這就是寶山唯一的娛樂地方了，什麼的電影，京戲，話劇，這是他們做夢也不會想到的。在寶山最苦的要算是害了病請不到醫生，雖然縣政府辦了一所衛生醫院，但因爲沒有經費，所以藥品也沒有，因此你非得到外埠去醫治，否則就只好活活地病死。你想這是不是一件滿苦的事呢？</p>
<p>教育不振　縣政廉潔</p>
<p>寶山的敎育，本很發達，人但因經過歷决兵　，不無影響，况且目今又因縣政經費困難，敎費業已數月未發，於是敎育頓呈破產現象。</p>
<p>寶山共有城廂，月浦，羅店，劉行，大塲五個區全縣人口，共計十三萬五千餘人，寶山縣城內人口，的三千人左右。縣長程導民，操守十分廉潔，深得一般民衆之愛戴和信仰，程縣長自奉很儉，每日的小菜錢，早，中，晚，三餐，只有支配三百元，的確，他是和屬員們同甘共苦的，他是勤政愛民的，在目今社會上食汚橫行的風氣中，實屬罕見。</p>

<h3>低能兒童的教養</h3>
<p>— 余人鳳</p>
<p>近代的敎育，巳由籠統的而轉移到個性的敎育法則了。爲了兒意知識的高低不同和個性的差異，纔有了天才，常態和低能兒童的分別·一般地說，常態兒童佔據着最大多數，而天才和低能兒童是比較少的。歷來人類似乎只注重了兒童的特出人才的培養而忽略了一般低能的孩子。這是他們的不幸，也是人類的缺陷；因此我們也應該因才施敎，總得使他們儘量發展知能，適應生活。</p>
<p>一般父母，對各個兒童都是用着同一的方法敎養的。但對於低能的孩子甚至於放棄了他們敎養的責任；尤其因爲我國敎育的不發達和沒有特殊的設備，低能兒童都遭到了厄運，他們的生存一只是痛苦和贅疣。作者有鑒於斯，特提出幾點意見，供獻給有低能兒童的現代父母們。</p>
<p>（一）何謂低能</p>
<p>關於低能的定善和解釋，各異其說。有些學者以爲那是質的不同，魷是知力低微；另一說是量的不同，換句話說低能不是知力不够，只是知能的多寡而已。不過我們不是去討論原理，我們可以在生理心理兩方面得到一個比較確切的答案。</p>
<p>（一）生理的原因——低能是重大而永久的神經缺陷，由於神經祖織的不發達。</p>
<p>（二）心理的原因——低能爲心理的不發達或缺陷，發生在生前或生後而影　於於知力的判斷和理解。這種缺陷是難以醫治的。</p>
<p>（三）「優生學」上的解釋——由民族繁衍的不適當，因而遺傳而來。</p>
<p>我們看了上面的各個解答，也許會使我們把「低能」與「愚鈍」混而爲一了，所以這裏必須附帶說明，凡是進步遲緩和精神上一時的缺陷決不是低能；因爲那是暫時的，加以適當的引導和療治就　恢復常態的。</p>
<p>（二）低能兒童的特殊教育</p>
<p>（一）注重體格和技能的訓練——低能兒童雖然也能書算，不過總是很有限量的。除了自痴和有無法治療的大缺陷的低能兒童外，我們應注重他們生活技能的訓練。所以體魄的訓練和按能敎育應佔大部分時間。如：步行，賽跑，跳躍，灑掃，洗物，敲釘，製造簡單椅桌，大鍼縫紉等簡易粗陋的活動最適宜。他們爲了心理上有缺陷，大都不好動，我們可以鼓勵他們遊戲，引起他們的活動興趣，因爲這在訓練和敎學上有很大的關係的。</p>
<p>（二）知能敎育應漸進——上面我已說過，低能兒童是缺少普通智力的。他們對於理解力，判斷力，學習力都十分薄弱，因之我們要磨練他們的思考力和筋肉動作。各種積木的玩具是很好的敎具，可以給他們玩去。一方運用體力活動的遊戲使他們能適當的滋長和活躍。不過無論用怎樣的敎育方法，總得低於一切常態兒童所能及的能力，並且應忍耐地敎他們學習。學習步驟的適常是敎育上成功的條件。出於低能兒　理解能力以外的複雜問題，要他們去做，那是必定失敗的。</p>
<p>（三）給予的刺激要重複——低能兒常常沒有完全的反應。由於神經系統作用的比較遲鈍，所以刺激的過於快，他們就難以應付了。因之讓他們在同一環境中反複地練習一種反應，使他成爲習慣一般，到了相同的境遇時，他們就會很熟習地反應了。一個刺激成功後，再給予新的，這樣才有效力。</p>
<p>（四）給予同精和快感——動物田的通性：對於能生快感的反響選擇而學習；反之對於能生不快感的反應排除而棄掉。對於低能兒更宜用這種原理去實施。不要爲了麻煩和無耐性而厭惡，應想到他們的可憐而多給予同情，使他們在心靈上不致再受抑阻。</p>
<p>（五）設計敎育的應用—在遊戲中及日常生活環境中，引導他們學得許多有用的識能。那種效率決非書本所能及的。例如：小孩子喜歡組織家庭，我們就可利用那時機，讓他們各行使其家庭中的職守，敎以種種應得的知識。設計教育法一方以兒童興趣所在爲討論目標，但是也應將範圍在可能之中擴大，使低能的孩子在集中訓練上得到更大的效果。</p>
<p>（六）本能的善導—低能兒的本能和情緒並不因知能的缺乏而有缺陷。普通的低能兒都有平常兒童所應有的本能。不過我們應注意低能兒缺乏自制力—本能情緒强而知力薄弱，所以德育的訓練對於低能兒更是重要。我們應使他們知道善與惡的分別。本能的衝動應有正當的表現和處理。允其是性本能。低能兒的兩性本能很强，但爲了自己缺乏理知的制止，依據格而克（Guilk）的調查，成年低能者犯私生，野合或其他違法性行爲的很多。所以兩性衛生和道德更應使他們了解。留心他們有什麼不道德行爲發生。低能兒的服從本能很明顯，容一易受人利用和引誘，易受指揮，易受欺騙。最適當的避免方法，除了使他們有道德，倫理觀念外，就是使與不良環境隔絕，以免外界勾引。如不早　田意，癖性旣成魷難改了。</p>
<p>（七）關於地低能兒的賞罰—低能兒旣不了解善惡與苦樂的自然因果，所以一方固應養成他們良好習慣；一方於善惡之行爲表現後，給以相當之賞罰，務使獎善責惡，發生運結不解的關係。我們賞罰低能見童，不能以常態兒童爲標準。有些常熊兒童尙且還不知善惡行爲的分別，更何况是低能者，當然更不了解，正如跛者不能責他蹣跚不前一樣道理，他們是應該特訓的寬恕的。至於賞罰的方法應用具體事物，顯而易見而眼前便見報應的方法。把玩異糖果作獎品，不許玩某一件用具，不許吃某一種糖果，不許他和同伴一起遊戲，那些都是很好的賞罰方法。我們的態度要溫和，但是也不要太姑息。不過我始終反對體罰，同樣也不要行使在低能兒童身上；因爲我們呌他們悔改，不是呌他爲了害怕而不去做；我個所願望的收效是永久的，不是暫時的。</p>
<h3>爸爸要帶他出去旅行</h3>
<h3>賭，害了上海婦女</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>年幼時我在寗波鄉間，從未見過女人坐着打牌，因當時一般人眼光，以女人打牌爲下流。可是想不到在今日的上海，一般婦女以打牌爲家常便飯，不以爲恥：其實眞是害了上海婦女。</p>
<p>一，怠忽家務：女人爲了要緊打牌，草草烹煮，不事修　衣履，甚至連地也不掃，床也不整，任憑陳設凌亂，不以爲意。</p>
<p>二，慢待來賓：有客人登門拜訪，或接洽事務，女主人正在打牌，茶也不見，水也不見，只坐着贈　邊以屁股對客人，使客人感到無趣而去。</p>
<p>三，放縱見女：做母親的一打牌，兒女便以爲機會來了，討錢格外爽氣，養成浪費習慣，胡亂買吃，不計衛生；戶外遊蕩，荒廢學業，若交給女佣手，也不得正當訓育。</p>
<p>四，家庭失和：賭錢人把錢看輕，往往反怪丈夫賺得少。熱心於賭，待丈夫愛情冷淡。因家庭起居無序，引起丈夫丕關。久而久之，造成惡劣事態者，亦數見不鮮！</p>
<p>五，健康受損：女人熱心打牌，有的蓬頭垢面，不事修師，冷暖不時，不加衣着；肚餓不吃，形成胃病；加以現行打牌花樣百出，要大動腦筋，思慮過度，引起失眠症，日趨衰老，甚且促短壽命，亦非過甚其詞也。</p>

<h3>給小姐們</h3>
<p>— 孟晋</p>
<p>相識遍天下，知心無一二，交友尙非易事，况論擇偶？尤其是女人，一經結婚即須負起敎養兒女職務，將自己精力實獻家庭，一個男人儘可娶一無能力的太太，一個女人如嫁了毫無能力的丈夫，就得跟他餓肚子。但是，男子遲十年結婚並沒多大關係，而女子年紀稍大，就想　麻煩，換言之，女子擇偶時期較短，女子多喜年輕漂亮又有地位的男子，但天地間却找不到這樣的男子，一個年輕人談不上有地位，一個有地位的人，往往已兩鬢如霜，並且誰不早魷兒女成行？至於年輕漂亮的公子哥兒，仗父兄福蔭而顯出他地位的特殊，但這一類人大多沒出息，並非理想的丈夫，正因這樣，所以許多女人常因條件太苛，誤了靑春。</p>
<p>其次，沒澈底了解愛情的女人，都喜在追求期能體貼入微的男子，在她們的眼中，一個男子只要性情溫存，愛情就有保障，殊不知男子畢竟是男子，不敢發怒發狠的男子，不是沒出息，便是虛僞，每一個有作爲的靑年，都有他自尊心和事業心，他可能爲他愛人犧牲一切，但在追求期間，他的表情是含蓄的，而且很容易適可而止。他不輕易追求女人，但追求後如遭白眼，就立刻向後轉，道種男子似乎不易把握得着，但一經魷範後，他的愛情往往是純潔可靠的；相反的那些體貼入微的男子，大都是情塲能手，最靠不住，在戀愛期中是一個理想情侶，婚後則是個二三其德的丈夫。女人擇偶之難，就難在好男子不拚命追求，拚命追求的則大多不是好男子。誰都承認華盛頓林肯是富有熱情的好男子，但美國當年的女子，有幾個慧眼識英雄呢？</p>
<p>從一個人的胸懷，可以看出他整個的人格和前途，一個只知替自己打算，只知出風頭的人，他的情話越說得肉麻，就越顯出他的渺小，小姐們！請留心點。</p>

<h3>烤餅是怎樣做成的</h3>
<p>— 至</p>
<p>炊事是主婦們應該研究的。當你的丈夫在辦公廳回來的當兒，他的身子是够疲倦的，你若能做一樣好吃的點心或豐盛的晚餐，那不但使自己多學炊事之技能，還能使你的丈夫忘記疲倦，更能增進夫妻間的愛情哩。</p>
<p>現在我將「烤餅」法寫在下面。</p>
<p>材料——麵粉，油，糖，水等。</p>
<p>方法——分插酥，邊皮，包心三項手續。</p>
<p>（一）做插酥——把麵粉盛在缽內，另把葷油燉溶如水，注入粉缽，調成粉塊，揉揑調勻，搓成長條，切成小塊，又一搓圓，狀如桂圓。</p>
<p>（二）做邊皮——方法同上。但以三分之二的水，三三分之一的油，混和調成粉塊，亦切成小塊，搓成圓形，如桂圓大。</p>
<p>（三）做包心——方法同　　，也是純用油液調粉，不過要加入白糖，揑切成塊，再搓成圓形，如桂圓大。</p>
<p>以上三種都做好，再合攏來。</p>
<p>合攏的方法，好像做糰子，先將邊皮塊揑成凹凸形，將揷酥塊放入作餡子，包起來，搓圓：次即將此圓塊再揑成凹凸形，將包心塊放入作餡子，包起來，搓圓，然後撳扁，但周圍仍須保持圓彩。</p>
<p>如此做好餅坯後，便可加烤，烤法：先將鍋釜燒熱，在鍋面上途擦一層油，再將餅坯一一排列的攤入鍋內，幾度翻動，烤至黃熟而未炙焦時，便可剷起來。</p>
<p>假使，餅坯做好後，如欲加些裝飾，有三個取便當的方法。你不妨試一試。</p>
<p>（一）利用干凈的梳（即理發用的梳子）齒，在餅坯面上，印成點綫的菱形紋，或六角形紋。</p>
<p>（二）利用大麻果（如菊花印）或芝麻豰（她的橫斷面適成梅花印），醮些個脂水，在其表面印成散點花紋。</p>
<p>（三）如欲印成浮彫紋，可用一種陰紋的印模，如印糖糕一般。</p>
<p>附述兩種烤食法：</p>
<p>（甲）烤肋肉（粵人稱「叉燒」）專取肋條部分的筋肉略帶一些肥肉，抽去肋骨，塞入葱苗，　在炭上烤，同時，以醋和醬油，常常塗敷上去，使牠入味，（不喜歡醋的人可不用），烤至裏面熟透，表而微焦爲度。</p>
<p>（乙）烤鷄烤鴨將宰好洗淨的嫩鷄或嫩鴨，浸入醬油中的半日，取出稍稍風乾烤於炭火上，時時翻身，勿令灼焦，皮面常常塗以麻油，烤至裏外熟透爲度。</p>
<p>以上兩個大的普通一般能幹的家庭主婦是很輕而易舉的事，希望讀者一試爲幸。</p>

<h3>清代畫家的戲曲</h3>
<p>— 振之</p>
<p>淸代畫家兼作戲曲家，見於記載的有：張衢，嚴保　，萬榮恩，湯貽芬，姚梅伯等人，所著雜劇，傳奇，存者頗多。下面分別叙述：</p>
<p>張衢</p>
<p>蔣寶齡「墨林今話」卷十「張晴齋畫宗北派」條說：</p>
<p>「張晴齋衢，蕭山人，弱冠補諸生，嘗客都中。塡南北曲有名，所著「芙蓉樓」，「玉節記」傳奇兩種，已刊行，京師菊部中爭演之。其「信芳錄」（載東林黨人甚詳），「賢賢堂集」及外書皆未刊。今年八十餘猶健在。畫宗北派，多奇氣。」按張氏傳奇二種均存，咸豐叩鉢齋刊本，鄭西諦先生藏有兩種，北平圖書館及吳梅各有「芙蓉樓」一種。姚爕「今樂考證」著錄（十）入錄。焦循「曲考」及王氏「曲錄」以「芙蓉樓」屬薦山作，疑爲同名的別一本，因薦山所作別有「易水歌」一種，非張氏撰。</p>
<p>嚴保庸</p>
<p>「墨林今話」卷十一「寫生家度曲金鍼」條記嚴氏云：</p>
<p>「嚴但常保庸，號問樵，丹徒人，舉已卯鄉試第一。余始識之郡垣。與翁海村，改七薌，廖裴舟，林子安諸君游讌極歡。人或以害解元况之，弗樂也。旣而入翰林，改知縣，官山東棲霞二年，有政聲；以母憂歸，遂不出，其澹於榮利如此。君篤志好學，自以爲詩古文辭不逮古人，爲傳奇無愧作者。所著「同心言」，「奇花鑑」，「紅樓新曲」諸院本，風行都下，唐陶山方伯集句贈之云：「孺子亦知名下士，樂人爭唱卷中詩」紀實也。畫蘭竹有逸致，旁及寫意花卉。嘗舉吳梅村「似能不能得花意」七字，爲寫生家度世金鋮，識者韙之。」按支豐宜「曲目表」及「今樂考證」著錄（五）淸雜劇部除上舉三種外，另有：「吞　報」，「雙煙記」二種。此外又有「望夫石」，「姽嬧封」，「盂蘭夢」三種，今存。</p>
<p>湯貽芬</p>
<p>「墨林今話」卷十五「畫銓析覽」條記湯貽芬云：</p>
<p>「湯雨生都督貽芬，字若弼，晚號粥翁，武進人，以祖父難，蔭，弱冠襲雲騎尉，爲三江守備，歷官粵東·山右·浙江，儒雅廉俊，盜賊聞風帖弭，後以撫標中軍參將，擢溫州鎭副總兵，因病不赴。退返向門，賃周進士保緒園以居，思終隱焉。都督稟質穎異，凡天文·地輿·百家之學，咸能深造。書畫詩文，並臻絕品。嗜飲酒，工彈琴。」按湯氏後於成豐三年太平天國攻陷金陵時，殉難死。又同書「畫梅樓詩詞」條記云：</p>
<p>「聞都督洞精音律，製有「梯仙閣三種」，令家婢歌之，咸能上口。斯又別有寄託，非東山絲竹陶寫中年意也。」按湯氏有「逍遙巾」雜劇一種，北平圖書館藏抄本，盧前曾刻於「飲虹簃叢刻」中。劇分：尋春，卜夢，納訪，巾盟四折，演湯氏至蔚州，與蔚尉徐子容交遊事，是其自述，無可取。「今樂考證」著錄（十）出別有「劍人緣」傳奇一種，今未見傳本。如果這兩種全在「梯仙閣三種」之內，剩下一種是不知劇名的雜劇或傳奇。</p>
<p>姚燮</p>
<p>「墨林今話」卷十八「姚孝廉」條云：</p>
<p>「鎮海姚野樵變，字梅伯，甲午舉人。工盡，善墨梅，白描人物，寫意花卉，亦盡入古法。庚子春正，君自吳門北上，余絜茝生送之梁溪，同遊鄧尉，惠山而返，舟决曾爲茝生題「湘江幽思圖」浪淘沙一闋云：「詩夢抱蘭衾，水氣沉沉；峨眉山小挂　陰，淡沱湘痕秋一剪。人語煙心，書漿幾時尋？極浦天深，宓妃含睞弄幽禽。唱到水雲縹渺曲，玉籟吹琴。」刻有「疎影樓詞」八卷。兼善音律，有「褪紅衫」，「梅沁雪」傳奇兩種及「詞律勘誤」，詩文集若干卷。』按姚氏以「今樂考證」一書，爲世所知。輯有「今樂府選」五百卷，所撰傳奇二種，自撰「今樂考證」中未著錄，馬裕藻跋文謂各八卷，二種均無傳本。</p>
<p>萬榮恩</p>
<p>馮金伯（冶堂）「異香居畫議」卷十記萬榮恩云：</p>

<p>俗曲作者招子庸</p>
<p>「墨林今話」卷十七藝苑佳話」條記招子庸云：</p>
<p>「招子庸銘山，南海孝廉，喜畫竹，與羽可同癖，官山東湘縣令，嘗於牘尾畫竹，有板橋道人風。又局試意子時，購扇數百柄，堆積案頭，竟日揮洒，各分贈一握而去，亦藝苑中佳話也。子光，號小銘，亦畫竹，兼美畫蟹。」按招氏非戲曲作者，以撰粵調俗曲「解心」著名，也是畫家兼曲家。容元胎君曾撰有小考，論招氏及其「解心」，刊「歌謠周刊」。</p>
<h3>我國文化西來一證</h3>
<p>— 魯</p>
<p>自伊寗事件發生，政府對保衛大西北，異常重視，此决國民大會，亦涉及邊疆問題。筆者按我大中華民族，係多數民族以文化融合而成，證之歷史，即今日之漢族，其最初之先祖，亦自西北徂東南；且其淵源之遠常較今日之西北邊陲，尤爲遙遠。蓋亞洲人類文明，發源於中亞西亞西方學者，屢有發見，尋其發展之跡，向東一支，有一部份停留於今之西北，一部份再延展向東南而遂中原，得優越天時地利之助，而發揚今日之漢族文明。</p>
<p>稍具歷史智識者，當知巾華之建國，肇始黃帝軒轅氏。考軒轅氏之稱號，史載帝生於軒轅之丘，因以爲氏。而軒較之丘，則註在今河南省境；年代湮遠，難得有力之佐證。筆者按軒轅之釋義爲車類，而黃帝發明指南針，其遺制迄今爲航海輔助利器；蓋黃帝當時率其族衆，向東拓展，一如哥倫布之探覓新大陸，憑藉指南軍，由西北高原，沿山脈折而南向鴨趨中原。忽發現水土豐腴，氣候溫適之平原，不禁禁歡呼曰「華」，華者美也，於是中華民族之名義遂定。中原土著，獉狉未脫，突見多數東徒降臨，無以名之，則名之曰軒轅氏，亦猶今日之稱坦克車隊裝甲車隊是。</p>
<p>黃帝見以優越之配備，克服土著領袖蚩允氏，垂衣裳制曆法，設官定樂，其妃嫘祖，興蠶桑之利，奠中國文明之基石。</p>
<p>故吾人對西北同胞，根本無須分漢族與邊族，蓋祖孫百世，一脈相傳，固不可分亦不必分也。</p>

<h3>西洋鏡</h3>
<p>— 夏當</p>
<p>夏當（Simeon　Chardin　1699-1779）是法國羅可可時代之名畫家，與華茲齊名，但作風各異，他捨棄當時那種豪華優閑的世風，專事研究日常觸目的生活中的種種動態。作爲題材，作風偏重寫實，平生所作以靜物最多，也常作素描速寫，這張「西洋鏡」就是一則。（獅）</p>
<h3>弗朗士·許貝德最後所寫的…</h3>
<p>— A華爾柯稅作　李孟飛譯</p>
<p>這是一驚用最尊敬和親切所寫的，是述及弗朗士許貝德（一七九七—一八二八），這位年靑音樂家最後幾天的故事。而奇怪地，也就是他一生的故事—在悲憤和窘困的浪漫生活中，不斷地彈奏出他尊貴而永存的旋律。</p>
<p>一八二八年十一月的某一天，弗朗士許貝總患着傷寒症，病歿在維也納郊外他哥哥的屋子裏。祗一年前，當貝多芬瞑目與世長辭時，他還手執火炬，參加送殯行列中的一個。當他們把樂聖埋葬在花林後；歸途中，他們走進了一家酒館，那是許貝德呀，他高舉着酒盃，向衆祝飲：「誰將是樂聖貝多芬的繼承者？」可是死的陰影，不久就降臨到這個不幸，悲慘，肥矮，不修邊幅的年靑人身上，他近視的眼睛，凄涼的情緒，不再有他迷人，優美的歌曲供獻給世界了。</p>
<p>以後，誰再會帶給我們這些充滿了愛的短歌，歡愉的頌讚，眞摯的情感的自然十流露，令人神往的旋律的禮物—祇有他，是一個不竭的音樂泉源。然而在一八二八年十一月間，結凍了他短促的生命後，是再也不能聆聽到他更多一絲的聲息。他奔放如湧泉的作曲天才，當他作四部合奏曲的時候，他得需要助手爲他謄寫。每值夕陽西下，夜鶯啼唱的時候，他的小夜曲（Serenade）或將爲之失色。</p>
<p>可是當人們燃上燈火的時候，許貝德的小夜曲又被記憶起來。這是他整個生命中不會忘記的一個。是的，他將永遠地牢記着。這一首不朽的歌曲，是爲祝賀一個女孩子的生日而作的。在那天，作者亦得親自列席爲合唱隊伴奏。在暮色蒼茫中，鋼琴已移動在花園內，合唱隊亦都集合在他愛戀的女郎的窗下，可是弗朗士，他，他竟忘却了來到。</p>
<p>雖然他只有三十一歲就死去，而他的作品已超過了一千首。他所有開在淸單上的財產，照市價最高估價，計值八先令六辨士，還得包括最後一年內偉大的作品的原稿。實在的，許貝德那久經失傳的尊貴的遺稿都散亂在維也納。一代以後，年靑的奧塞沙利文和他的朋友格羅荷從英國渡海而來，焦急地開啓了一間已被忘却了的私室，找到了Rosamunds遺失的部份。在漫漫的子夜以後，他們發掘了許貝德的寶藏。當金色的霧靄昇騰的時候，才完成了抄錄的工作。因爲他們年靑，他們狂熱地深愛着弗朗士許貝德。他們不能抑制的情緒，僅能玩着跳田鷄的遊戲來表示，直至咖啡館開始營業的時候。</p>
<p>關於許貝德的多產，每每被譏爲使他貧困和潦倒的原因。他在一天中能够譜成十二支歌曲。他天眞地想把作品從一個出版商那裏去換得豐富的代價。可是許貝德在一月前售給他的二十四支歌曲，還未曾印行呢！</p>
<p>那麼，什麼才是許貝德最後所寫的呢？是，是一封信啊，一封寫給友人修伯的信。這一年初，他們倆人合住在藍猬，直至這個歌曲之王連一半的租金都付不出來，才搬走了的。</p>
<p>親愛的修伯：</p>
<p>我病着。已有十二天沒進過一些東西。我是感到非常的疲憊和震顫，祇能支持從床到椅子問的來回。琳娜服侍着我。就是少許的嘗一口，也得依然嘔吐出來。在這種苦惱的境况之下，讀書是我最親切的帮助。關於柯伯（註）所著的「馬別肯斯的最後」，「間謀」，「領港者」和「先鋒」我都唸完了。假使你有柯伯的書籍，請你在咖啡館內交給高格納夫人。我的哥哥，他會非常謹愼地把它們帶給我。或者另外的書籍也好。</p>
<p>你的朋友許貝德一八二八年十一月十一日</p>
<p>假使你認爲這封信是可愛的，這或許是因爲在多年後才被發現了的，他那往昔每爲人懷着緊壓的心，注意的一個不幸的音訊，因此至今還有存在的價值，而遺憾的是，常許貝躺臥在床上，切望着柯伯的「殺鹿者」，可是這一書在一八二八年許貝德臨終前還未完成。……</p>
<p>雖然許貝德已躺臥在他安謐的墓園裏，在這個音樂氣氛濃厚的安息地，速高飛下的麻雀，也會緊靠在他身邊，傾聽他溫柔的心房的跳動。</p>
<p>註：柯伯（James　Frenimore　Cooper）美小說家（1789-1851）。其所作小說，大半以美國和印地安戰事爲題材。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一雨血　118</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>鶴見這時，雖說十分驚與，却幸早已料到這一着，不曾扯謊，然而也驚出了一身冷汗；當場只得一面翻看文件上的報吿，一面儘力壓制自己緊張的情緒。看那報吿上面，從自己自下飛機以來，一舉一動，及在黑龍會上的經過等等，都記載得明明白白，連在舞應打了幾個電話，所說的什麼話，都一字不訛，赫然載在上面。並日連「〇十二號」帶了人來，在「新綠」舞座外面，把那幾個追攝鶴見踪跡的人，如何解決，等等，也寫了出來。又說明這邊如何設伏，如何把鶴見的汽車司機打發回去。</p>
<p>鶴見看到道裏，身上的冷汗，已經淌了一背心。「好厲害！」心下兀自這麼驚嘆着，在的莫十幾分鐘內，把這壘報吿的略瀏覽了一過，便紫性從衣底隱密處所，把萍子的那張小紙，也取了出來，請那侍妾，遞給近衛；又將自己害怕的心理，臨時將小紙撤換的事，也據實說明。近衛聽了，　　咯咯，怪聲大笑起來：</p>
<p>「很好！吿訴你罷，你們的兒女私事，我管不着。再吿訴你，中村小姐寫的什麼，你雖沒有知道，我却可以說給你聽！巧妙得很，其中也許有一段天綠；據你所說，你在紙上所寫，不過當時看了那客室中吊屏上的句子，偶然胡亂寫上，然而萍子女士所寫，湊巧正與這字句相同，僅有一個字的差別；你寫的是「春花秋明等閒度，往事多少君自知，」她的上句，與你完全一樣，下句却寫的是「往事多少盼君知。」……</p>
<p>「不過，這一個字的差別，關係很大！她爲什麼盼望你知道他的往事呢？你不知道，我可知道！因爲她對於你，崇拜已有好幾個年頭了。……哈哈，她對你的情意很深了！……這是可以慶祝的一件事！」近衛說着，便命侍妾，「賜酒。」……</p>
<p>福島北邊，近海邊上，有個小地方，名呌松島，雖然很不出名，然而風景絕佳。這地方離開東京，有五六小時火車路程。鶴見在近衛那裏受了幾小時的罪，一出門來，天色已經大亮，看見自已的汽車，好好停在門口，〇八號司機，野猪，也好端端的站在車外迎候。鶴見一夜磨難過來，覺得草木皆兵，也不想問野猪打聽什麼。一上了車，只說了「車站」兩個字，就蜷伏在車廂裏。到了車站，便吩咐野猪回去，自己就去買了上福島轉松鳥的車票；下午三點多鐘，就到了目的地。</p>
<p>鶴見在車上，也無法休息，因爲這一夜的經過，簡直超出了他的意想以外：萍子；總國第五縱隊；靑木；近衛；等等，人物方面的突襲，事情上面的變幻，都在可能想像之外。回想起來，簡直是一個　夢。要不是他會己的神經健全，簡直認爲自己眞在夢中經過了這多怪事。這些事情，接二連三，來得太快，快得無法招架。</p>
<p>松島是他兒時當游的地方，在未到中國大陸之前，每隔若干時日，也得到這裏來耽擱一半夫。松烏鄉下，有個田木村，地方很偏個，戶口也少，風景極美，一連靠山；一邊就是海洋。達日本村裏，一幢靠山的村居中，住着一位年近六十多歲的老太太，小源夫人。她是鶴見那位養身母親梅子的探親。格子後來嫁給鶴見清之後，雙方走得仍很親熱。小源夫人，是個寡婦，僅有一男一女，所以待鶴見，如同自己兒子一般，比較梅子，還更體貼。</p>

<h3>火燭</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>風高好放火，月黑可殺人。天氣冷了，西北風緊，放火是强盜的勾當，可是我們貪睡怕寒，火燭不小心，星星便易燎原，太危險了！</p>
<p>前兩天，江滬的軍火庫爆炸，據說起因於一顆手溜彈的不愼落地，然而公私損失，直接間接，老實說，是無法估計的。倘使發生於閙市，豈非一幕空前大慘劇。</p>
<p>一家車胎行，兒子滿月，紅燭高燒，喜氣洋洋，不料樂極生悲，燭花碰着汽油，霎時間，整個店舖化爲灰燼，且殃及左鄰右舍，天下倒霉的事，無有過於此者的了。</p>
<p>爲了防止意外，做家主的人，每晚在臨睡之前，應該巡視一下廚房灶間各處，火爐電爐，電燈線路等等，得仔細檢查一下，看有沒有損壞之處，易燃的物品，保藏須要安全，凡此，事近瑣細，很容易爲人們所忽略，然而一旦禍生，則不免家破人亡。</p>
<p>年關期近，這一年大家雖過得很緊張，不大舒徐，但總算撑持下來了，誰再能經得起意外奇禍呢？謹以此提醒大家。</p>
<p>寓言</p>
<h3>假如人間僅剩一個能生殖的男子</h3>
<p>— 葉子</p>
<p>〔前言〕「自由談」月前刊載過一篇「寓言」，說原子彈有一天失愼爆發，把全世界男子的生殖力都消失了，幸而有一個在礦坑內的男工僅免於難，於是乎世界上這獨一無二的有生殖力的男子如何處置，成爲國際間一件大事。……</p>
<p>我並不將那篇文章常作「寓言」看，我認爲它是一幕「未來派」的悲劇。於是，我翻了好些書。結果，我曉得即使有這麼一天，科學家仍有方法來補救。在五年之內，全世界的女子婦人都可能由這個「人種」用人爲方法來「授孕」一兩次，十年之內，世界上每個健全的女子婦人都可能爲這「人種」產生一兩胎嬰孩，甚至由科學家指定是男的。三十年之後，世界將滿來了同一和父所生的第三代孫子。</p>
<p>假如那「人種」在炸發當時年僅二十歲，而且可以健康地活到七十歲，他還可能看到「天下一家」的「四代同堂」。其迅速，遠在我們意料之外。</p>
<p>以下所述，即根據原載「寓言」的假定寫成。「續貂」如下</p>
<p>先請讀者的原諒，下文叙述時，爲了方便和節省字數，筆省將便用若干個在在科學書上常見而「假道學」所不齒的字眼。</p>
<p>人工受精</p>
<p>「寓言」中假說一切男子除了一倘僥倖者以外，都消失了生殖力，而一切女的，似乎依然健在，祗要那一個男的生殖機能不消失，健康正常，那末，全世界人類之繁衍問題，決不如理想中那末嚴重。人們對在「一祖」之下，超速率恢復。</p>
<p>第一個補救方法是「人工授精」，這方法在獸類，家畜的育種上早已十分通行，譬如一頭好種的雄馬，畜牧專家常用頗簡便的方法，把這馬在一次內排出的確性生殖細胞（精子），分別用量灌人數四而至十餘四的雌馬體內，使其受精受孕，而這雄馬與「粥粥雌羣」問每一匹雌馬，無須有接觸的性行爲。</p>
<p>在人類方面，醫學上亦有採用相同方法的，比方在檢定過知通某一對男女兩性的生殖細胞（精子與卵子）都正常，惟獨有某種原因以致不能碰合受精時，也舉行這種人工方法，以資補助。近年來這方面的技術與工具日有進步，所以受孕率也一年比一年高。好些人經過一次人工補助，魷「馬到成功」，而且半數是一　　得男」！</p>
<p>不過人畜有別，爲了不需要，所以從未有人間究過一個男人每一次排出的生殖細胞，是供若干個女人「人工受精」之用。</p>
<p>理論上説</p>
<p>照理論上說，只要有一個男性生殖細胞與一個女性生殖細胞相碰合，就可以成爲「受精卵」，成長爲一個「胎」。天公不知道到底爲了什麼如此浪費：以一夫一婦制度三年一孕來說，男性在這時期內所排出體外的生殖細胞，最低最低的估訂，也在墩億個以上，然而有田的即有機會變成「受精卵」的，不過渺少的一個，幸運的一個雄性生殖細胞。</p>
<p>那「發明之母爲需要」，我們極有理田相信科學家在需要時即可發明「一精一孕」即百分之百的「人工授孕」，如此，前頭說過三年而至卞年內，全世界數億健全的適齡女性，都可能爲這個男的「人種」養下一兩個娃娃。這並非完全空想。讀者或許担心到這位「人種」搬來搬去於兩地極五大洲而疲勞不堪。事實上無須如此，內爲科學家早已獲到方法，便男的生殖細胞雖在人體之外，依然保養得好好而不稍减其活動力與生殖力，再加上近年來無遠弗屆的超速率長距離空中運輸，「爸爸」儘管在北冰洋也吧，「媽媽」却在赤道替他養下個娃娃了！</p>
<p>有「世道人心」的人或許會爲這位「人種」的消耗太大而憂心。其實這也是多餘的。生殖力的補給，無非是生殖內分泌即「性荷爾蒙」的補給。中國人數十年來以吃「牛鞭」「猴子睪丸」作爲「補腎劑」，在今日科學的醫學中有所謂「臟器療法」，無論原則與方法，與此並無不同。不過原子能巨量爆發後、一切男性旣然消失了生殖力，恐怕那時的雄性動物也消失了雄性生殖力。靠這方法還是不成。</p>
<p>幸而數年來「人工合成化學」大有進步，男性荷爾蒙之一的「睪丸素」，巳經可以由化學家在試管內製造成功，而且在市上賈得大行其道。據專科的學報上發表的結論，甚至「天閹」或「人之闈割」如太監之類，用這種人工合成的化合物，立即可以恢一復其生殖機能。健康的「人種」一之「補給」，當無問題也！</p>
<p>有胎皆男</p>
<p>「寓言」上未說及女性生殖力已經消失，那末趕快養下一批男嬰，在「人口政策」下，實屬至急之道。</p>
<p>我們曉得，人類之男女有別，其原因在其父親的生殖細胞有兩種，某一種成爲男胎，另一種成爲女胎。</p>
<p>據去年蘇聯發表過一段科學報道，說他們已經有方法能把男性生殖細胞用「電離解」的方法，在有一「電極」下收集得來的精子盡生男嬰，另一「電極」的則盡生女嬰。詳細的方法雖未發表，不過科學家已做倒這地步，似無可置疑。</p>
<p>夫死受孕</p>
<p>從以上所說的來推論，光憑這一個「人種」而用人爲的方法於十年之內使每個現存的女人替他生個男孩子，最保守地說，總可說有這麼個可能的機會了。</p>
<p>假如原子彈爆發那時，他僅二十歲，那末，他五十歲生日時將見全世界他的第二代及媳婦們向他道賀。他那時還有盛旺的緊殖力。</p>
<p>七十歲，第三代兒媳向他賀喜。</p>
<p>假如他不幸在五十歲未滿就死亡呢，也不怕，因爲在這次世界大戰末年中，科學家又用低溫及其他特殊方法來保藏精子於男性體外，雖五年，十年亦不稍變，如此，「人種」死後十年間，他的「兒子」仍可不斷產生。</p>
<p>惟一不幸</p>
<p>我們不曉得這位「人種」在身體和腦子上有無缺陷或不良的遺傳因子。假如有，「人類之永劫」將長此繼續。因爲從第三代起，或者，甚至由第二代起，盡是血族婚姻，兄與妹，表兄與表妹，從兄與從妹之類，一切可遺傳的不良因子，從此增强不衰，直至人類眞的沉淪絕滅！</p>
<p>所以，我也反對用原子彈來殘殺人類。</p>
<p>新聞人物</p>
<h3>彭學沛小史</h3>
<p>— 黃接靑</p>
<p>國共停戰，國大開會當中，中央宣傳部長彭學沛成了最沈默的一個人物。</p>
<p>彭先生是江西安福人，表字浩徐，年紀還祗四十八歲。他曾劉學日本東京帝國大學，留居日本達七年之久，後來轉學法國，並在比利時布魯薩爾大學經濟系取得畢業文憑。民國十四年回國，在北京大學和法政大學先後担任敎授，他的動人講辭，的確獲得靑年學生熱烈的擁戴。</p>
<p>彭氏轉入政界，始於民國十六年夏，當時担任國民黨上海黨務訓練所的敎務長，後來升任內政部次長，行政院政務次長，交通部次長，最近榮任中宜部長，成爲政治舞台上一員重要角兒。</p>
<p>彭氏曾入汪逆精衛幕帷，賓主頗爲相得，汪逆倡和之際，彭氏意志堅定，未爲所動，因得維持他的政治地位，今日更被宋院長倚爲左右手。</p>
<p>民國十六年十二月，上海中央日報創設，彭氏被任總編輯，著有「歐美日本的政黨」，「中外貨幣政策」等書。</p>
<p>他實在是一位熱悉金融經濟的政治家</p>
<p>彭先生身材不甚高大，過去蓄有短鬚一撮，望之儼然　人，勝利後已剃去，雖稍减威嚴，却更有精神得多了。</p>
<p>上海橫斷面</p>
<h3>叫化子的組織</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>平劇例有龍　，所有公侯將相出塲，總先有龍套四名以上分列左右，呆若木鷄地站立着。每家大戲院都自有班底，專充此項活動佈景。但上海小規模戲班很多，平日限於開支，班底人數極爲有限。臨時需要更大的龍套時，祇好由老弟兄丐帮供應。後來因爲此類的需要日漸增加，帮中便有專任此項龍套的人物出現了。他們統稱爲「龍將軍」。</p>
<p>丐流之充任此種半永久性的龍套職業者，大都外貌整肅，事實上已脫離丐流的本來面目了。這是年已長成的乞丐專任的，小鬼以年齡關係尙無資格入選。凡是自備有班底的戲班，在平日需要能將軍不多時，本台班底固足應。但若新排一劇，需要龍將軍五六班，而班底祇够三班時，祇好向老弟兄去零拆碗菜。雖然每塲龍套出台的時間，並不　突，但因魏蜀吳原爲對立，曹操的龍套自不可再在趙雲廳堂上出現，因恐觀衆認得出來，被壞了劇中的情節也。今有現成的龍將軍可以僱用，而且是按日計酬，戲班自然也樂於價用。業此者雖不需什麼技能，但對於出場人塲，都有一定的路綫規法，一步之差，便要當塲出醜，觀客是決不容恕的。龍將軍對此頗有經騐，外行人自然不敢來搶奪這口飯了。</p>
<p>龍將軍以四人起碼爲一堂，四人中也有頭二三等之分。出入場領路者爲頭等，因其行動須視劇情的關節而進退，關係頗大，故工資較其他三人爲高。</p>
<p>龍將軍之外，還有一種飾富女的，通常也是此輩龍將軍的男化女妝。但非身面整齊修短合度者不能充任。這在帮中算是鳳毛麟角，而其報酬却多出男龍套一倍以上，如果有機緣可以充作齡班的班底，他們自也集此不疲；因爲生活可以解決了。這樣過了一年半載之後，誰也想不到那些在戲台上美目流盼的古裝侍兒，先前原是睡桶搶飯的流浪兒呢！</p>
<p>戰前的上海，堂會票戲盛極一時，富戶或小康人家如有喜事，總請票友惑小戲班唱堂會，所需要的龍將軍和宮女，往往向戲院裘借不到，於是祗好請敎到這班在野的龍將軍批發所了。堂會的報酬較戲院優厚，除吃喝之外，還可討喜封。此外如可跟隨名伶赴外埠唱戲，收入尤爲可觀。個中人都視爲利藪.他們都不惜鑽營活動，希望得到跑碼頭的機會呢！</p>

<h3>死人最要面子</h3>
<p>— 石谷</p>
<p>這次的冬令救濟委員會，籌募捐款，據說兩天的成績，還不及普善山莊的多，有人說：「上海人喜歡巷死人做事」，也有人說：「因爲死人最要面子」！</p>
<h3>團結</h3>
<p>— 石谷</p>
<p>據說中國人的團結，可在馬路上表現出來：</p>
<p>一輛吉普卡輾死了人，不要滿一分鐘，出事地點立刻被團結了起來，團雖結，但大家都抱了看熱鬧的心理，不問不聞，事完了一鬨而散，所以這句「五分鐘」的話，似乎還沒有錯呢？</p>
<h3>以喜以懼</h3>
<p>— 南溟</p>
<p>公司商店中，奢侈品購買者減少。或謂這是人民崇高節的的表現，或謂這是社會經濟崩潰的先聲。兩種說法都有道理，所以令人：一則以喜，一則以懼！</p>
<h3>上海的「世外桃源」</h3>
<p>— 桂</p>
<p>矗立在南京西路大華大戲院東隔壁，有一座擁有十幾年歷史的紅色洋房，約占二畝有餘；雖然整天整晚有不少人路過，但能知道裏面的設備和組織的人，却很少有。這座房屋最先是由猶太人承造，設猶太總會；到後來猶太總會遷移至慕爾鳴路及中正中路口，該處租予上海跑馬總會，再由跑馬總會租予美國第四海軍陸戰隊。繼而太平洋戰爭，該海軍陸戰隊早已撤退，遂由日本陸軍佔據，設陸軍部及弘報部於該處，及勝利後，一度由國軍暫註，後始改爲現在的美國海軍俱樂部。</p>
<p>該俱樂部內部組織係由海軍另組管理處，管理一切內外部，俱樂部雖然進出總係一般士兵，有時候柯克上將亦常來。上次美國海軍部决長布雷福斯德來上海，匆忙間照樣在吳市長宴會後十時許，由柯克上將陪伴作一次巡禮。不論官職大小，在裏面的享受是一視同仁，從不分彼此的；所食的西菜是有限價的，限價是由海軍部執行，如牛排，諸，排鐵排鷄等只有二千元法幣一客；咖啡的價目是同馬路上的攤販售一樣價錢。其餘如啤酒，可口可樂，香烟等，是軍部配給的；因爲免稅價錢的優宜，使商店無可與之競爭；因此影響到外面的酒吧間，一家一家的壽終正寢。當在七月四日的一天，是美國的紀念日，俱樂部內威士忌，三明治，可口可樂等均是免費盡量供給，眞使人贊仰人家優待士兵的無微不至。</p>
<p>跳舞是美國人最性喜的一種娛樂，該處設舞塲在二樓，舞池的大小的與米高美一樣；至於樂隊是就聘於上海的，現在是由黑人的樂隊演奏；但是有時候是由海軍及海軍陸戰隊所組的樂隊表演，逢星期六及假日的佔多數。潘玉珍的表演亦是缺不得的，士兵們所帶的伴侶，以俄人及國人據多數。其中份于最複雜的要　國人，包括吉普女郎，交際花，舞女，鹹水妹，學生，以及寫字聞職員。最使人惋惜的是一般受過高等敎育的學生同護士。她們不願在國人面前拋頭露面，以免見到熟人。一般鹹水妹最發噱，芳名都是呌什麼落麗泰，麗琳等，說得好的英語，竟使人不信是幹這行業的。至於不會說的指手劃脚，多得不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>電影是由兵士自己放映的，每日二場，下午四時及七時半．他們老早所演的片子，差不多到現在各戲院還沒有上映。最名貴的一齡是曼兒奧白朗主演的，「一夜在天堂」（One　nightinParadise）爲一全部五彩神話片。他們在今年六月已放映過了。其他的片子都是最新的，換片是每逢二天換一次。</p>
<p>其他還有子房，圖書館，乒乓室等等娛樂。其士兵的享受雖國人所謂高等華人，亦莫能及之。一嘆矣！</p>
<h3>大減價</h3>
<p>回憶勝利之前，物資匱乏，舶來品斷絕，更因投機者的操縱，物價是無時無刻不激劇上漲；那時的商店都簡直不想做生意。至於舉行大減價則是近乎傻子的了。但而今大减價的氣熖却竟如此高昂，大减價的旗幟到處理揚</p>
<p>街頭到處是以大减價爲號召的商店，收音機終日不停　擾地播送着，或僱了簡單的樂隊，奏着陋俗的音樂，掛燈結彩，五色繽紛。這熱鬧繁榮的景像眞是非　　所能形容。另有一種大減價的方式是把排門都關起來，只留着一扇小門出入，門外貼著鮮艷奪目「關店大拍賣」等刺激的標語，眞是別出心裁！新聞紙上也充滿巨幅的大減價的廣吿，但這些也不容易引動人們的心！</p>
<p>商店的大减價很少是爲了「優待顧客」的，實際上他們都是有着很大的苦衷。近來物價的波動不大，高利貸猖狂，商人們當然不肯把貨物久擱，而一面付出利息。他們都深深地明白現在不是囤積居奇的時候，惟有貨物早日脫手，週轉靈活纔是賺錢的辦法；而且年關將屆，人欠欠人都該有個結束，自身過年的費用也該有個著落。在此種種情形下，於是如火如茶，似瘋似在的大减價遂全面性地舉行起來了。</p>
<p>但數年來，人民的生活已折磨得凋疲不堪，購買力是普遍地低落了，大减價又有何用？</p>
<p>大減價是熱鬧的，仔細一想，却要抱頭痛哭呢！（承連）我們徵求下</p>
<p>國外瑣聞</p>
<h3>鬥雞在美國</h3>
<p>— 郁强</p>
<p>如果說門雞是一種遝動，那麼它的性質和跑馬一樣—一種賭博性的運動。</p>
<p>美國很早就盛行鬥雞，前期的總統華盛頓，傑弗遜，林肯等，都是「鬥雞熱」者。後來各州有　於鬥雞的勞民傷財，便都紛紛立法禁止。現在除了佛羅利逹州不林禁止無賭博性的鬥雞外，其他各州連鬥雞的木身都在禁止之列。</p>
<p>雖然如此，北起緬因州南迄佛羅利達州，東自紐約州西止魏俄民州，每年還是有數百次的鬥雞決賽。大賽，錦標賽在秘密舉行着。數百萬美金的賭注，在交換着主人。幾千頭細心飼美的鬥雞整日做生死之搏門。上萬的娛樂捐成了主辦鬥雞的「爺叔班子」們的「主持費」。</p>
<p>因爲門雞是違法的，所以舉行的地點都在荒僻之處，時間都在晚上。下爾是某次鬥雞，主持人通知賭徒尋覓門雞場的一張「路往單」：</p>
<p>「沿美國公路第六〇〇〇六號向南行駛過布蘭克偉爾二哩後，離開公路向右沿碎石路前進，沿碎石路進行六又四分之一哩後，經過一橋；過橋後，向左駛入第二條泥路，泥路右邊的第三條弄堂，一直前進，即達鬥雞場」</p>
<p>鬥雞塲的四週有人守望着，進塲要納五塊錢左右的入場費，另加十分之一的「娛樂捐」。鬥雞場通常是搭在現成的大型的馬廐或縠倉之內，四週門戶緊閉，不使燈光和囂呌透露出去。內部的情緒則如拳擊場一樣的緊張，鬥雞場之上更用一千燭光的水銀燈照　著。</p>
<p>鬥雞的武器，除了天生的利喙與銳距之外，雞主更在牠們的距上安置了一枚一吋半長的鋼鈎，銳利得如同尖針一般，鋼鈞是釘在一塊皮上的。這塊皮裏在雞腿上，然後緊緊的用　綫紮起來。門雞的尾部和翅膀的羽毛也都經過剪裁。</p>
<p>鬥雞之前，賭客們自由的尋找意見相反的人打賭，就是在門雞進行中也可以隨時打賭。——其中最活躍的當然是自信心最强的雞主。</p>
<p>鬥雞開始之前，兩個雞主各自握住自己的雞，使牠們互相用喙啄，以喚起門志，然後像拳賽開始一樣，分別退據一角，等到裁判員一聲令下，便將雞釋放，讓牠們趨集台中，舊力搏鬥。</p>
<p>鬥雞的過程確是够刺激，但見四足　躍，毛羽奮張，動作之快，目不暇顧。但是也够殘忍，鋼鈎起處，鮮血淋漓，有時鈎在眼部，述眼珠都會鈎出來。</p>
<p>在搏鬥過程中，個如有一隻雞受傷倒地不起，也和拳賽一樣，裁判可下令暫停摶門，由雞主將雞扶起，用種種方法恢復受傷者的戰鬥力。這時，裁判員數着一·二·三……，數到二十的時候，（大的十五紗鐘），倒地的雞如不能「重上職場」，便算是輸了。</p>
<p>此外，還有一種「鬥雞錦標賽」，並不是下賭注，而是奪頭獎的。每個雞主隨便帶幾隻鬥雞（通常是四隻到八隻）參加，每人繳納一定數額的參加費，以便匯集做爲獎金。頭獎金額從二十五元到一千元，有時更多些。</p>
<p>參加費醵集後，便衡量鬥雞的重　，每一對搏門者的電量，一定要近乎相等——這種觀念也是脫胎於拳賽。錦標賽之外還有「大錦標賽」，就是會合幾個小錦標賽一起舉行的。普通錦標賽除了頭獎之外，沒有小獎，而大錦標則常有二獎，有時也添設三獎。似如是十個一千元獎金的錦標賽會合舉行的大錦標賽，這一萬元的獎金，通常的分配是：頭獎六千元，二獎三千元，三獎一千元。</p>
<p>賭傳是人類的劣根性，假如僥倖的心理不能澈底的消除的話，陰傳不是法律所龍禁絕的。</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Presidium's Fifteenth Meeting Re-Examines the General Assembly Agenda and Confirms the Comprehensive Authority of the Review Committees</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Presidium held its fifteenth meeting at 10 AM on the 9th at the National Assembly Hall, chaired by Chen Guofu. Important resolutions were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The motion to re-examine and confirm the General Assembly's agenda was resolved and passed.</p>
<p>(2) The motion regarding the Review Committees' mission and authority was resolved. The Review Committees' mission and authority are as follows: A. The Review Committees shall focus on reviewing the draft Constitution and handle representative proposals concurrently. Written and oral opinions shall serve as reference materials. B. If the Review Committees need to amend any articles of the draft Constitution, they shall propose specific wording. It is advisable to propose only one type of wording for each matter.</p>
<p>(3) The motion to confirm the mission and scope of the Comprehensive Committee was resolved. The mission of the Comprehensive Committee is as follows: A. Matters related to each Review Committee and matters on which the Review Committees cannot reach a decision. B. Matters where the review results of each Review Committee differ from the principles of the draft Constitution. C. To compile the results of each Review Committee and perform textual organization of entire chapters as early as possible.</p>
<p>(4) The motion to nominate personnel to attend each Review Committee to explain the principles of the draft Constitution was resolved: the nominees are Zhang Jisheng (張　生) for the First Committee, Sun Ke for the Second, Wang Chonghui and Wang Shijie for the Third, Chen Qitian for the Fourth, Wang Yunwu for the Fifth, Jiang Yuntian for the Sixth, and Shao Lizi for the Seventh.</p>
<p>(5) The motion to establish a compilation team in each Review Committee was resolved: each Review Committee shall handle the matter at its discretion and no separate compilation teams shall be established.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The Review Committees of the National Assembly’s draft Constitution have, according to regulations, nominated liaisons with the Presidium. As of today, the Third Committee has elected Pan Gongzhan, the Fourth Committee has elected Li Zhongxiang, and the Seventh Committee has elected Xiao Zheng. The other committees are in the process of nominating.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The members of the Comprehensive Review Committee of the Constitution of the Republic of China have been elected. A total of 200 members have been elected, including 141 nominated by districts, 32 nominated by conveners and review committees, 9 nominated by the Presidium, and 3 each nominated by overseas Chinese, social elites, freelance professionals, the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Chairman convened a dinner at his official residence at 7:30 PM on the 9th, inviting the Kuomintang representatives among the conveners of the draft Constitution review committees, to hear their reports and opinions from the review committees, and will provide some instructions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Chairman Jiang hosted a luncheon at his official residence on Huangpu Road at 12:30 PM today, inviting National Assembly representatives Hu Shi, Fu Sinian, Jiang Mengpu, and others.</p>
<h3>First Review Committee Holds Third Meeting Today; Second Review Committee Determines the Number of Attendees Required</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The First Review Committee of the National Assembly’s draft Constitution held a meeting of conveners at 4 PM on the 9th, deciding: (1) to hold the third review meeting at 3 PM on the 10th, and (2) to nominate Representative Li Junfu as the chairman of the third review meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Second Review Committee of the draft Constitution convened a meeting of conveners at 2 PM on the 9th. At around 3 PM, a plenary meeting was held in the second lounge of the Assembly Hall. 171 representatives attended, including Kong Geng, He Zhonghan, Hu Shi, Lu Tangping, and Tang Guozhen. Lin Bin presided over the meeting. Shao Lizi, the originally nominated chairman, only participated with his opinions from the side because of a sore throat. After the meeting began, Sun Ke, representing the Presidium, first explained the nature and execution of the draft Constitution review work on behalf of the Presidium, and then left. Chairman Lin then reported on the tea party hosted by the Presidium for the conveners of the review committees on the afternoon of the 8th, as well as various decisions. Immediately, the issue of the quorum of the Review Committee sparked a wave of discussion. Representatives generally believed that one-tenth was too few and lacked solemnity. After a vote, it was passed by an overwhelming majority of 150 votes that at least one-quarter of the representatives must be present for the meeting to be held. Shao Lizi left at 4:30 PM. The election of two representatives to participate in the "Comprehensive" Review Committee began, and the meeting adjourned at 4:50 PM after designated vote counters were chosen.</p>
<h3>Third Review Committee Nominates Representatives to the Comprehensive Committee</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan and Shi Shangkuan Take the Roles</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Third Review Committee of the National Assembly's draft Constitution review committee held a meeting at 10 AM on the 9th in the lounge on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall, chaired by Pan Gongzhan. Conveners Wang Chonghui, Wang Shijie, and Jiang Yuntian all attended. When the meeting was announced, there were 84 representatives present. Subsequently, a total of 139 people arrived. The chairman first reported that 100 proposals related to the Third Review Committee had been received in the morning, and then reported on the cases related to Chapter Four, requesting the representatives to discuss them in order. As soon as this announcement was completed, Chen Changheng, Chen Qianxi, Cheng Cangbo, Liu Butong, Zhou Yiyun, Chen Guyuan, and others made relevant speeches. After the representatives expressed their opinions, the chairman declared: If Chapter Four to Chapter Nine are merged, this would be a change to the content of the review and should be submitted to the Comprehensive Review Committee for discussion. Today, we should still discuss the original scope in order. At the same time, Liu Butong stated that this kind of principle issue cannot be debated in this way. If the principle issue is discussed first, theoretical issues will arise again, and the meeting will not be able to continue, and he proposed that the meeting be adjourned immediately. Regarding the third opinion, the chairman explained that the conveners only received the fourth opinion before the meeting. The chairman reported that it was the Presidium's decision, but because there were many opinions at the time, the chairman put it to a vote, and the majority voted in favor of one-quarter being the quorum. Finally, the chairman announced that it was decided that the conveners would be responsible for determining the meeting schedule before each review meeting, and classifying the relevant proposals before submitting them for discussion. The meeting is now adjourned. The conveners will meet in the afternoon. The meeting adjourned at 11:20 AM. The meeting did not address the main topic from beginning to end, and the speeches and discussions were quite complicated. Fortunately, the chairman handled it in an orderly manner, resulting in a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Third Review Committee held a meeting of conveners at 3 PM this afternoon. Except for Representative Wang Chonghui, the other eight people attended. Hosted by Representative Pan Gongzhan, they focused on actively classifying and organizing the proposals and extensive opinions in a quiet atmosphere, and dispersed only at dusk.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] In addition to the previously nominated Zeng Qi and Jiang Yuntian as representatives to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee, on the 9th, the conveners of the Third Review Committee mutually nominated Pan Gongzhan and Shi Shangkuan as representatives to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee, and in accordance with the notification method of the Secretariat, designated Pan Gongzhan to maintain close contact with the Presidium at all times.</p>
<h3>Fourth Review Committee Divides into Three Groups for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The third meeting of the Fourth Review Committee of the draft Constitution was held at the Public Recreation Association at 9:40 AM on the 9th. Chairman Li Zhongxiang first reported that Representative Zhang Gai proposed changing the first sentence of Article 82 of the draft Constitution, "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the state," to "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the state." The participating representatives unanimously agreed and revised the original record. Yang Yifeng and others requested that, because the scope of the review was too broad, the judiciary, examination, and supervision should first be divided into three groups for preliminary review in accordance with Article 4 of the Review Committee Organization Law, and then a full group review meeting should be convened to make the final decision on the review. This was unanimously agreed, and the representatives immediately freely determined which group or groups they wanted to join.</p>
<h3>Central and Local Authority: Groups Five and Six Will Jointly Review</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Fifth Review Committee of the draft Constitution held its second meeting at the Public Recreation Association at 3 PM on the 9th, chaired by Huang Jilu. The chairman reported on the discussion of the draft regulations for the review process, and the election of Li Zonghuang, Shi Zizhou, Li Shizhen, Zhang Honglie, and Wang Xuhui as members of the Compilation Committee, followed by a discussion of the review principles of Chapter Ten of the draft Constitution. The first item was to determine the principles for the division of authority between the central and local governments, which was divided into three items: (1) a system of divided powers, (2) a system of centralized powers, and (3) a system of balanced powers. The chairman reported that, according to the Preliminary of People's Rights, the last item should be put to a vote first. With 43 people present, it passed by an overwhelming majority of 34 votes. The system of balanced powers between the central and local governments was then discussed in detail. Wang Zhengting, Shi Zishu, Xu Xiaoyan, Liu Jiu, Wu Tianzhen, and others spoke, with most representatives advocating a three-level system of balanced powers, that is, the division of powers between the central government and the provinces, and between the provinces and the counties. At 5:20 PM, Wang Yunwu, dispatched by the Presidium, arrived to explain the original intent of the draft Constitution. Regarding the issue of authority between local and central governments, the draft Constitution adopted a listing approach, and at that time it was believed that the authority of the third level, namely the county, did not need to be stipulated in the Constitution, because the county is a constituent part of the province, and because the level of education in each county is different, there cannot be a fixed regulation. Representative Xu Xiaoyan believed that if the county is to carry out affairs, it must be given the power to legislate on its own in order to exert its abilities. After two hours of discussion on the issue of authority between local and central governments, it was decided that because it was related to Chapter Six on county autonomy, the Presidium representative Wang Yunwu should be asked to convey to the Presidium that a joint review meeting should be held with the Sixth Review Committee. The issue of county autonomy was then discussed.</p>
<h3>Sixth Review Committee Passes Review Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Sixth Review Committee of the draft Constitution was held at the Second National Assembly Guest House at 3 PM on the 9th. Sixty-four representatives attended, chaired by Zheng Yanqi. The chairman reported that the General Assembly Presidium received a total of 412 proposals, of which 37 were related to this committee, and were now generally divided into nine categories. Jiang Yuntian was also recommended by the Presidium to this group to explain Chapter Eleven. Jiang then explained the drafting process of Chapter Eleven, saying that the division of this chapter had been carefully considered. It was originally stipulated that the provincial autonomy law should be formulated by the provincial people of each province, but it was feared that the customs and habits of the people in various places would be different, and that the regulations of each province would be too far apart, causing difficulties for the central government in implementing laws and decrees. Therefore, this chapter was formulated. After Jiang left the meeting, the chairman announced the draft review procedures decided by the conveners' meeting of this group in the morning. Immediately, a representative proposed that the proposals should be sorted and classified before discussion. It was decided that the conveners and the secretary would be responsible for sorting them out. There were no objections to the review procedures, and they were passed.

<h3>Seventh Review Committee Divides Work into Four Subgroups</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] After discussing the matter in the morning, the conveners of the Seventh Review Committee of the draft Constitution convened a plenary meeting at the assembly hall at 3:30 PM on the 9th. 188 representatives attended, including Chen Guofu, Li Weiguo, Zhu Jiasheng, Fu Sinian, Xiong Zhiyi, and Dengzhunasan. The originally nominated chairman Tudan Sangbu did not attend due to business, and Xie Chengping presided over the meeting instead. First, it was decided to divide the review work into four subgroups: the first subgroup on national defense and foreign affairs, the second subgroup on national economy, the third subgroup on education and culture, and the fourth subgroup on social security and health administration. After each representative sat and signed in according to their group, the election of two conveners for each subgroup was conducted.

<h3>Based on Recent Trends, the Draft Constitution May Have Revisions, and Some Articles Will Adopt a Compromise Approach</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] In addition to the draft Constitution proposed by the government, the National Assembly has 421 proposals from representatives, which have been printed and distributed to the review committees on the 9th. They are now stepping up the sorting, review, and exchange of opinions from all parties. Based on recent trends, the government's original draft Constitution may have some revisions. Important issues are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Article 1 on the form of government, some people advocate using the "Three Principles of the People Republic" in the original draft Constitution of the May 5th Constitution, but a compromise opinion may revise it to "Three Principles of the People Democratic Republic."</p>
<p>(2) The capital may maintain the government's original proposal, and Article 7, which stipulates that the capital is Nanjing, may be deleted, and the article will not be stipulated in the Constitution.</p>
<p>(3) The issue of territorial changes will be revised to stipulate that it cannot be changed without a resolution of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>(4) The organization of the National Assembly, members of the Legislative Yuan, and members of the Control Yuan may not concurrently serve as representatives of the National Assembly. The members of the Control Yuan may be elected by the National Assembly, and those elected are not limited to representatives of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>(5) The National Assembly representatives may adopt both regional elections and occupational elections at the same time. At the same time, the number of representatives that ethnic minorities should elect will be stipulated by law.</p>
<p>(6) The National Assembly's powers may be increased to include the election and recall of the president, vice president, and central government officials, the revision of the constitution, and the initiation of central laws.</p>
<p>(7) The National Assembly may be changed to meet once every three years, and the National Assembly meetings may be changed to be convened by the president or convened by the representatives of a certain number of National Assembly.</p>
<p>(8) The members of the Legislative Yuan will still be directly elected by each region in proportion to the population. (9) If the appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan requires the consent of the Legislative Yuan, the number of times consent is required may be limited.</p>
<p>(10) If the Legislative Yuan disagrees with the Executive Yuan on important bills and policies, the Legislative Yuan may request the President of the Executive Yuan to resign, and the Executive Yuan may also request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan for re-election or convene the National Assembly for a referendum. (11) The President of the Judicial Yuan, the Grand Justices, the President of the Examination Yuan, and the members of the Examination Committee may still be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Control Yuan, but some also advocate that the power of consent be exercised solely by the Legislative Yuan. (12) The audit of the final accounts and the audit work may still belong to the Control Yuan. (13) The autonomous status of ethnic minorities in the border areas and the development of the economy and education in the border areas may be specially stipulated in the chapter on basic national policies.</p>
<p>(14) The articles in the chapter on basic national policies will be added to or deleted. Those related to economy, education, and culture must be enriched, but it is not yet certain whether they will be listed as separate chapters.</p>
<p>(15) In the election chapter, it may be stipulated by law that women should elect a certain number of National Assembly representatives and members of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>(16) After the constitution is promulgated and before it is implemented, there must be transitional measures. The National Assembly may formulate a law on the procedures for implementing constitutional government to provide the National Government with a basis for implementation on the eve of implementation of the law.</p>
<h3>The Government Considers Sending Personnel to Yan'an in Order to Restore Peace Talks; Reports that Eight Ministers of the Executive Yuan Will Be Transferred Are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Foreign Ministry spokesman Ye Gongchao declared at a press conference of the Central Propaganda Department on the afternoon of the 9th: The government is considering sending representatives to Yan'an to consult with the Communist Party on restoring negotiations. It has not yet been decided who will be sent by Huanfu. Ye's remarks were in response to a reporter's question about whether it was true that the government would send Minister Wang Shijie to Yan'an as a prelude to restoring negotiations. The reporter also asked whether it was true that the National Assembly would be extended again due to the above relationship. Ye avoided answering. Another reporter asked whether it was reliable that eight ministers would be transferred to the position of provincial governor and that their vacancies would be filled by third-party figures. Ye said: "I have not heard of this." The reporter asked what proposals the representative would bring if the government sent a representative to Yan'an. Ye said: "You can ask the representative in the future." Because the reporter did not get the main point of Ye's reply, he turned to ask Minister Peng. Peng said: "Some people believe that according to the new organization law of the Executive Yuan, eight new ministries will be added, and therefore believe that these eight ministries will be filled by third parties, and the original ministers will be transferred to the position of provincial governor. This kind of thinking is too "mathematical" and is therefore inaccurate." After the meeting, Peng told reporters that the government has "no specific plan" for sending a representative to Yan'an. A reporter asked whether the "ministers would be happy to go." Peng smiled without answering.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] It has been rumored in Beijing in recent days that a senior official will be sent to Yan'an. The newspaper reported on the 9th that the candidate might be Wang Shijie. The reporter made a special trip to visit and inquire on the morning of the 9th. Wang firmly stated: "I will definitely not go. As for whether someone else will go, I don't know." According to the reporter's inquiry, Zhang Zhizhong is very likely to go. As for the rumor about Shao Lizi, Shao himself has firmly denied it.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party Office told reporters tonight: The two demands put forward by the Communist Party in its previous letter to Ambassador Marshall are consistent positions that have never changed and will not change in the future. If the government cannot accept these two demands, peace talks cannot be reopened. Wang also said: He received a telegram from Yan'an tonight stating that eleven regiments of Hu Zongnan's troops are advancing towards Liulin. The consequences of continuing this kind of warfare are unimaginable. The reporter then asked whether the Communist Party welcomed the government's sending a senior official to Yan'an. Wang replied that they had not received any notification. At the same time, peace talks must be based on the two aforementioned demands.</p>
<h3>Ambassadors Marshall and Stuart Have a Long Talk and Continue to Mediate Behind the Scenes</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Ambassador Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart at 11 AM on the 9th for a long talk. Stuart went out with Chuan Jingbo in the evening. It is believed that Marshall and Stuart are still making strong behind-the-scenes mediation for China's peace.</p>
<h3>Zhang Junli Visits Nanjing Briefly and Returns to Shanghai After Meeting with the Chairman</h3>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] Hu Haimen, Liang Qiushui, and other veterans of the Democratic Socialist Party flew to Shanghai by China Aviation aircraft on the morning of the 9th, accompanied by party members Chen Banshi and Liu Jingyao.</p>
<h3>Special Notes on the Draft Constitution Review Meeting</h3>
<p>— Our Reporters Zhang Ming, De, and Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>The Third Review Committee was the most exciting and the most representative of the spirit of democracy among the meetings this morning. Chairman Pan Gongzhan remained calm and handled the situation in an atmosphere of back-and-forth remarks. A reporter said: "Mr. Pan is always smiling today."</p>
<p>The most frequent speakers were the members of the Legislative Yuan, including Chen Changheng, Chen Guyuan, Liu Butong, and others, each with their own merits. Chen Changheng first said that the principle was a matter of principle, and then Liu Butong said that it was now a matter of principle, and that it would be a matter of theory later, and that if the discussion continued in this way, it would not get to the main topic and should be adjourned. Then Chen Changjiu immediately stood up and said: "I am not explaining theory..." This was very exciting and fully demonstrated the spirit of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>Chen Qianxi was the first to speak today. Before the meeting was announced, after reporting that the number of attendees was 84, which was sufficient for a quorum, he stood up and opened fire, loudly questioning: "Who decided that? Eighty-four people is enough for a quorum?" The convener's reply was: "The Presidium decided." Chen fired again: "Who stipulated this? Why is it stipulated like this? It's outrageous!" This quarrel was able to proceed only after the chairman gave a slight explanation, but this undercurrent still existed. After discussing for a while, it was raised again, and Cheng Cangbo also stood up and said: "This is not a problem for our group alone, but for the entire body."</p>
<p>Chen Qianxi spoke many times and argued repeatedly. After one of his speeches, the chairman declared: According to Article 7 of the National Assembly Organization Law, there should be a limit on the time and number of speeches, and Chen temporarily stopped.</p>
<p>The Seventh Review Committee was presided over by Xie Chengping of the Youth Party, whose attitude was open-minded, flexible, and said "Representative Mr. So-and-so," "Your group," "Please the staff member of the venue," and so on. The move to divide the lines and sit first, then group and then sign in was clear and orderly, making people call it "wonderful."</p>
<p>When the National Economic Subgroup was electing a convener, someone nominated Wang Xiaolai. Wang, wearing a melon-skin felt hat and with a round face, stood up and said loudly: "Please pay attention, Chairman, Wang Xiaolai does not want to be elected." When the Education and Culture Subgroup nominated Zhu Jiahua, Zhu also stood up and said: "I am currently in charge of educational administration and it is inconvenient to be a convener." Chairman Xie replied separately that the opinions of the meeting should be respected and no more should be said. As a result, both of them were still elected.</p>
<p>Among the four subgroups of the Seventh Review Committee, the National Economy and Education and Culture subgroups had the most people, while the National Defense and Foreign Affairs and Social Security and Health Administration subgroups had very few. There were a total of nineteen female representatives present, and the number of them was: ten in the Education and Culture Subgroup, five in the National Economy Subgroup, four in the Social Security and Health Administration Subgroup, and none in the National Defense and Foreign Affairs Subgroup. People listening in said: "Look, the women's community does not want national defense and foreign affairs." In fact, 70% of those sitting in the seats of the National Defense and Foreign Affairs Subgroup were national guards in red-striped yellow wool coats.</p>
<p>Although Gu Zhenggang did not attend the Seventh Review Committee on the 9th, his popularity surpassed every representative who attended. He was often elected convener by the most votes in the National Economy Subgroup and the Social Security and Health Administration Subgroup. The two groups competed for him, and Chairman Xie said: "Representative Gu should be asked to choose himself." Chuan Sinian said: "Representative Gu is the proposer of the social security case and should be assigned to the Social Security and Health Administration Subgroup." Therefore, the Social Security Subgroup warmly applauded his welcome. Liu Zhendong filled the position of convener of the National Economy Subgroup with the second most votes.</p>
<p>Yu Bin Recommends Taixu Master as the National Assembly's Buddhist Representative</p>
<p>A reporter asked Yu Bin what was the reason for recommending Taixu Master as a representative of social elites? Yu replied: "This gentleman has great political wisdom and is a representative figure among monks. The number of monks in our country is considerable, totaling nearly one million. During the Anti-Japanese War, they were born and died to serve the country. After Taixu is their representative, their opinions can be conveyed through him."</p>
<p>Some asked why a monk who has become a monk should care about worldly affairs? He replied: "Although a monk has become a monk, he has not left the country." After he finished speaking, the Chinese reporters were greatly surprised. Bishop Yu spoke humorously and had no missionary habits. He himself is a member of the National Assembly Presidium, but he humbly said that the work of the Presidium is only to look at the clock for the representatives, and his task is equivalent to that of a waiter or errand boy.</p>
<p>National Assembly Representative Zhi Chaoying worked as Yu's interpreter, and Yu also answered in his Northeastern English. However, after mistakenly reading the English word "autonomy" as "astronomy," he quickly corrected it. The reception lasted for two hours and answered nearly 20 questions. However, the most notable one was Ye Gongchao. Regarding the government's sending a representative to Yan'an, the reporter, after listening to the eight religious issues, heard this answer and frantically wrote it down, fearing to miss a single word. The minister refused to announce anything about sending a representative to Yan'an. A reporter asked three questions, but he did not answer them and showed a small piece of paper, saying: "I have another appointment." After he finished speaking, he suddenly left. (December 9)</p>
<h3>The Government Has Not Yet Closed the Door to Peace Negotiations; the Chairman Declared at the Memorial Week</h3>
<p>[China Decisive News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The memorial week of the central authorities and the memorial of the Zhaohe warship uprising were held jointly at the National Government at 8:30 AM today. Chairman Jiang personally presided over the meeting and delivered a training speech. First, he described the process of the Yanhe uprising in the fourth year of the Republic of China, followed by the relationship of this uprising. The revolutionary cause of the party is very important, and he said that the revolution is not afraid of failure, and must have the spirit of persevering in sacrifice and struggle. The chairman expressed his gratification with the smooth progress of the National Assembly, and encouraged the representatives to formulate a democratic constitution and complete the mission of constitution-making. Regarding domestic issues, the chairman also said that the government has never closed the door to peace negotiations, and has consistently advocated resolving the issue through political means.</p>
<h3>Yu Bin Discusses the Constitution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 9th Dispatch] Yu Cheng, one of the members of the National Assembly Presidium and Bishop, stated at a press conference held by the Central Propaganda Department this afternoon, the 9th: The current draft of the Constitution is the result of incorporating and harmonizing the opinions of various parties and factions. Although it is not the most ideal, it is superior to the "May 5th Draft". He, standing from the National Assembly's position, expressed satisfaction with it.</p>
<p>Regarding previous reports that Cardinal Tian Gengxin would come out to form a political party, Mr. Yu solemnly stated that this was absolutely untrue. The idea of a bishop forming a political party is unheard of, whether in China or abroad, in ancient or modern times.</p>
<h3>Deng Wuliang and Xue Yichong Go to Rehe and Jin to Handle Emergency Relief</h3>

<h3>The Government Is Concerned About Overseas Chinese Crossing the Border; Asks the French Side to Provide Concrete Protection; No Need to Establish a Neutral Zone in Haiphong</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 9th Dispatch] External Affairs Spokesman Ye Gongchao stated: The Chinese government only recognizes one authority in Vietnam, namely the French authority. The Chinese Central Government has not established diplomatic relations with the Viet Minh. However, the representatives of China stationed in Vietnam have sometimes had de facto contact with local authorities. The Chinese government is deeply concerned about the safety of overseas Chinese in Haiphong, Saigon, and other places in Vietnam, and has made representations to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris to provide concrete protection. Some time ago, the Central Government suggested to both the French and Vietnamese sides to demarcate a clear-cut Chinese neutral zone in Haiphong, which neither the French nor the Vietnamese sides would be allowed to use as a base of operations. However, in the past three or four days, the situation in Haiphong has gradually improved, and the Viet Minh forces have successively withdrawn from the city, so the establishment of a neutral zone may no longer be necessary. However, since the lives and property of Chinese people have repeatedly suffered losses, it is still extremely concerned about the situation. Mr. Ye then cited examples of the illegal interference by the French military and political authorities in the activities of Chinese businessmen in Saigon, and said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made representations to the French Embassy in China. Mr. Ye further said: It is heard that the French authorities are levying a head tax on overseas Chinese in Saigon, while the Vietnamese do not bear this type of tax. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is investigating and verifying this report, because according to the Sino-French agreement signed in Chongqing this year, local governments cannot levy taxes on overseas Chinese that are higher than those levied on Vietnamese. Regarding the negotiations on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, Mr. Ye said that according to the agreement, the section of the railway within Yunnan Province should be returned to China unconditionally, and the technical issues of the handover are being studied. He did not believe that the Sino-French negotiations were hindered by the reorganization of the French government, and said that experts are currently investigating the losses suffered by Chinese public and private interests in Vietnam.</p>
<h3>Soviet News Agency Publishes Commentary Attacking the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 8th Dispatch] Izvestia columnist Belefutai Luo attacked the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty today, referring to it as giving the United States dominance over China's economy through treaty clauses and placing China under the control of American monopoly capital. It is claimed that the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty was signed before the opening of the National Assembly, indicating that the United States supports the Kuomintang government and strengthens its position in foreign policy. The CCP did not participate in the convocation of the National Assembly. The ruling class of the United States hopes that China will enact legislation through a one-party government to legitimize the stationing of U.S. troops in China, saying that it comes from the invitation of a legitimate government. However, if the Kuomintang government does not respond to the CCP's demands to resume negotiations and form a coalition government, China's political crisis will inevitably deepen.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 9th Dispatch] A government spokesman today criticized the Izvestia article attacking the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty, saying that the rights given to the United States by China are no more than those given to any other country. The Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty is based on the principle of most-favored-nation treatment and equality, allowing the United States to trade in China only on a reciprocal basis. Although some countries have not yet benefited from the provisions of the Commercial Treaty, they will still fully enjoy its benefits in the future.</p>
<h3>Wu Peifu's Public Funeral Approaching; Yang Sen Returned to Beiping from Shenyang Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Philippine Government Sends Personnel to Land on Tuan Sha Island; Our Personnel Unable to Take Over</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 9th Dispatch] The Provincial Government previously sent members Xiao Ciyin and advisor Mai Yunyu to take over the Tuan Sha Islands in Hainan, and planned to rename them Weinan Island.

They will determine their next course of action after the situation is clarified and instructions are requested, and another diplomatic procedure may be required.</p>
<h3>During the Haiphong French-Vietnamese Military Conflict, More Than 500 Overseas Chinese Were Killed or Injured; Property Losses Reached 100 Million Vietnamese Currency</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 9th Dispatch] According to news obtained here, during the eight days of the French-Vietnamese military conflict in Haiphong last month, overseas Chinese in Vietnam suffered losses of up to 100 million Vietnamese currency, with more than 500 people killed or injured, 1500 missing, and 400 homeless. The Vietnamese military destroyed reservoirs, so the drinking water problem is currently serious, but it is expected to be repaired within February. Half of Haiphong was destroyed in the conflict between the two armies. French people are now occupying Haiphong City, while the Vietnamese people have withdrawn to the suburbs with the Vietnamese army. The war broke out on November 20 due to the French military transporting Vietnamese police to suppress riots. A batch of French troops inspected a gasoline-carrying steamship, which the Vietnamese considered an infringement of their sovereignty, and they immediately opposed it. As a result, street fighting broke out. The French military used tanks and artillery, while the Vietnamese army only used pistols, machine guns, and grenades. Overseas Chinese attempted to hang national flags on the roofs to mark their identities, but were obstructed by Vietnamese soldiers, who threatened them with death and forced them to take them down. The French used warships to provide large-scale reinforcements and used airplanes to bomb Vietnamese military strongholds. Several places caught fire, but fortunately, Chinese organizations extinguished the fire. It is said that the situation in Haiphong is still tense.</p>

<h3>Land Transportation Inside and Outside the Pass; Several Issues Expected to be Resolved; Vehicles to be Repaired at Tangshan Factory</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 9th Dispatch] Several issues regarding railway transportation inside and outside the Pass have been partially resolved due to the trip of Shi Zhiren, Director of the Pingjin Railway Bureau, to the Northeast. (1) The Northeast Railway's Huangguantun Machine Factory lacks electricity and cannot start work, and the Dalian Shakoukou Machine Factory has not yet been taken over by us, so thousands of vehicles waiting for repair cannot be repaired. It has now been decided to hand over 800 of them to the Tangshan Machine Factory in the Pingjin area for gradual repair. The Tangshan Machine Factory can now repair 40 locomotives and 200 passenger and freight cars per month, but materials are extremely scarce, and the Japanese materials received have almost been used up, which is a serious problem for the future. (2) There are several inspection agencies in the Pingjin area and Shanhaiguan, such as the Northeast Xingyuan Commander's Office and the Customs. Due to complicated procedures, freight cars often stay for several days before being released after arrival. Shi Zhiren has also suggested simplifying the inspection procedures, which has been agreed to by the Northeast authorities. Shi Zhiren will report to Beijing on the 10th to solve the problems of funding and material scarcity. (3) Because one Beining Road is under the management of two road administrations, and Shanhaiguan also has its own stations, it has been decided to unify operations and increase efficiency this time.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Province's Budget Deficit; Central Government Agrees to Provide Subsidies</h3>

The Finance Department has reviewed them separately and will forward them to the Central Government for record. The amount of the deficit will be made up by the county governments themselves by eliminating redundant personnel or merging institutions.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Is Concerned About the Suffering Compatriots; Personally Orders the Allocation of 5,000 Sets of Cotton Clothing; Sends Chiang Ching-kuo to Xiaguan to Express Sympathy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 9th Dispatch] Refugees from various places in Northern Jiangsu and Northeastern Anhui who have fled to Nanjing have gathered in Xiaguan in recent days.

<h3>The Success or Failure of Military Service Work is Related to Nation-Building and Army-Building; Chairman Chiang's Speech to Students of the Military Service Class</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th Dispatch] After the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 9th, Chairman Jiang summoned all 314 students of the Military Service Research Class of the Central Training Corps in the National Government Auditorium. Head of Education Huang Jie led them to listen to the instructions. At 10:45 AM, the Chairman arrived to give instructions, stating: The success or failure of military service work is of great importance to building the Korean nation. In the past, there were many malpractices in military administration, which have been criticized by society. The experience gained during the War of Resistance is especially enough to serve as a profound lesson for us. I hope that everyone can use the spirit of revolution to cleanse away old habits, earnestly and responsibly implement the new laws and regulations, complete the mission entrusted by the government, and set an example for military administration. Everyone should adhere to their posts and fulfill their duties after being assigned to various places to serve. They must not interfere in local administration. If the work is done well, it will naturally affect politics, improve the atmosphere, and promote government decrees. The future of the country depends on it. I have high hopes for you. The speech ended at 11:40 AM, and all the students were extremely grateful.</p>

<h3>Guangdong's Five-Year Construction Plan; All Drafts Completed After Eight Months of Preparation; Focusing on the Economy, Striving for Sufficient Food and Clothing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 9th Dispatch] Guangdong Province's five-year construction plan has been in the works for eight months, involving over one hundred experts and detailed discussions by the Provincial Administrative Council and the Provincial Assembly, and has now been fully drafted. This plan focuses on the economy, first developing agriculture and industry, and will establish 80 public factories to ensure that the people of the province have sufficient food and clothing. In terms of culture, it will eliminate 80% of illiteracy, while cultivating and guaranteeing teachers, promoting social education, and establishing schools on a wide scale. In terms of politics, it will improve the political and social atmosphere of the province, improve the district, township, and people's associations, complete provincial autonomy, and lay the foundation for constitutional government. Chairman Luo has taken this plan to Beijing to request instructions and is preparing to begin preparations in the first half of next year and implement it in the second half of the year. Furthermore, the province's political expenses are quite problematic. At present, provincial financial resources are short, and the main source of income is the collection of 600,000 dan of grain as land tax. In addition, the provincial business tax this year is only 900 million yuan, and the increase next year will be limited. The total amount of new provincial taxes will not exceed 1 billion yuan. Looking at the overall income for next year, it will only be over 10 billion yuan, while expenditures will require over 40 billion yuan, leaving a shortfall of over 20 billion yuan, which is now being requested from the central government for additional political expenses. Furthermore, the Department of Construction has recently transferred all 3.3 billion yuan allocated by the central government to repairing the round-the-island highway and provincial roads on Hainan Island. The first phase of the plan is to repair 7,745 kilometers of provincial roads, 16,366 kilometers of county roads, and 351 kilometers of township roads, and experts and engineering teams have been sent to survey.</p>

<h3>The Executive Relief Administration Transports Rotten Food to Guilin; All Parties Request Thorough Investigation of Responsibility</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 8th Dispatch] The Guilin Branch of the Executive Relief Administration allocated 50 tons of food rice to Guilin City for work relief, of which 30 tons were moldy and rotten. All parties were in an uproar, and the City Assembly called for a thorough investigation. The rice has now been sealed up. Efforts should be made to find out the source of the moldy rice. However, according to the person in charge of the Guilin Office of the Branch Administration, 188 tons of food rice were transported from Guangzhou Bay this time and arrived successively. It is true that some of them were moldy and rotten. Governor Huang Xuchu of the province attached great importance to this case and has telegraphed the Guilin Branch of the Executive Relief Administration to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Lunar Eclipse Spectacle — Observation Record from Taipei Observatory</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 9th Dispatch] This morning, the Taipei Observatory held a lunar eclipse observation meeting. Before the initial loss, the reporter observed the moon from the equatorial instrument and witnessed several rough and uneven black shadows on this moon, which astronomers call the "desolate world." These are the so-called seas of the past, now renamed plains. Among these twelve plains of varying sizes, the largest has a diameter of 230 kilometers and is surrounded by high mountains. The clearly visible form is the white belt-shaped mountain range, of which there are six, the highest being 7 kilometers and the longest being 600 kilometers. There are as many as 112 craters, and there are also radiant lines with a lighter color than the moon itself. This morning, the sky was clear and bright, but at 12:10:12 AM, the moon began to change as it became tangent to the Earth and showed the "moon phase at the beginning of the eclipse," with the eastern edge gradually entering the dimness, appearing dim yellow, and then becoming more deeply tangent, and the brightness decreasing. At 1:18:42 AM, the "inner eclipse began, with the surrounding color blue and tinged with green, the inner layer rose and red-purple, and the innermost layer deep red and leaning towards the lunar surface. At 1:47:53 AM, the position of the moon turned to near Taurus and the star Auriga, and the middle of the moon grazed the Earth's shadow axis and entered the "middle of the eclipse," the plains in the moon became darker, and the mountain ranges and craters were hidden. Only a faint light remained on the lunar surface, the color being the lightest, and the ground was also as dark as the first day of the lunar month. At 2:17:05 AM, the moon was tangent to the Earth for the second time, and the eastern edge began to emit light slightly. Then, the moon phase became brighter, and at 3:25:35 AM, the entire "return to roundness" was achieved, and the moon returned to its original state. According to the Taipei Observatory's observation, the time of this morning's lunar eclipse was very consistent with the predicted time, but due to the limitations of the naked eye and instruments, in today's scientific age, a difference of five autumns above and below is still unavoidable. According to the Observatory's records, this lunar eclipse is also the second one this year. The total lunar eclipse lasted 3 hours, 15 minutes, and 23 seconds from the beginning of the eclipse to the return to roundness, which is 34 minutes and 13 seconds shorter than the first total lunar eclipse that began at 12:44 AM on June 15 this year.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Postal and Telegraph Rate Hikes Impact Newspaper Industry</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of postal and telegraph rate increases, people's organizations in various regions have repeatedly petitioned the government to retract its decision. Among them, those engaged in publishing and journalism feel particularly deeply the adverse impact of these rate hikes on their operations, and their calls for relief have become increasingly urgent. According to news reports, newspapers in the capital believe that the rate increases have significantly impacted their business development. They have repeatedly requested the relevant authorities to reduce the rates, but without success. They convened an emergency meeting on the 8th to discuss countermeasures and resolved: (1) to request the Ministry of Transportation to establish separate payment methods for news-related postal and telegraph services. Before the new methods are announced, the old rates will continue to be paid; (2) to telegraph industry colleagues nationwide to take unified action and temporarily pay according to the old rates until a resolution is reached. Simultaneously, the Hankou Newspaper Association also telegraphed the entire country, requesting the government to retract its decision. As this matter has developed to the current stage, we, as fellow members of the industry, feel it keenly and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we must offer our views to support our colleagues in Beijing and Hankou, and voice our common demands.</p>
<p>First, we want to declare that we share the same dissatisfaction with the general increase in postal and telegraph rates. Postal and telegraph services are state-run public utilities. Private operation of public utilities is not permitted to arbitrarily increase prices, so state-run public utilities should even less be allowed to arbitrarily increase prices. This is a basic principle. From a policy perspective, in the current economic situation, postal and telegraph rate increases not only fail to solve the difficulties currently faced by the postal and telegraph authorities, but also deepen these difficulties. Therefore, adopting this rate increase policy is tantamount to drinking poison to quench thirst. Moreover, once the public utilities directly operated by the state increase prices, the trend will spread, and others will inevitably follow suit, which will harm the balance of social order. The impact is far from insignificant. Therefore, abandoning principle and discussing temporary policies, rate increases are also a bad idea. According to reports of claims by postal authorities, the more postal rates increase, the poorer the post office becomes. It is claimed that before November (before the rate increase), the total revenue of the national postal service was 5 billion yuan, and expenditures were more than 3 billion yuan, resulting in a deficit of about 8 billion yuan. However, after a fivefold increase in November, postal revenue was 10.8 billion yuan, but expenditures increased to 20 billion yuan, an increase of 1 billion yuan compared to past deficits. And postal employees' salaries have not been adjusted. It can be seen that postal and telegraph rate increases may not solve the financial losses of the postal and telegraph service. Under these circumstances, the government could have issued special funds from the national treasury to subsidize the postal and telegraph service's losses. However, the government did not consider this and adopted the rate increase policy, presumably because of its reasoning, which is that using special funds from the national treasury to subsidize the postal and telegraph service's losses would inevitably increase currency issuance, directly stimulate inflation, and indirectly raise prices. This is of course a point worth considering. However, the result of rate increases is the same as the result of allocating funds for subsidies. There is no significant difference between them.</p>
<p>Now that the government has adopted a rate increase policy, the postal and telegraph rate increases seem to have lacked careful consideration. In order to promote the development of national culture, the state originally provided special preferences for the mailing of books and newspapers. This intention is profound and has its reasons. Unfortunately, the impact of this postal and telegraph rate increase on the book and newspaper publishing industry is extremely unfavorable. The Central Daily News once published an article on this postal and telegraph rate increase, believing that this increase in postal, telegraph, and transportation rates does not leave the newspaper industry any room for survival, and it has the suspicion of draining the pond to catch all the fish, which is equivalent to strangling the newspaper industry with a noose. Today's transportation authorities will bear the responsibility of hindering cultural progress and will be the sinners of national culture. Although this argument may be a bit激昂 because of the direct impact, its motives deserve our sympathy. However, since the government has adopted a rate increase policy to compensate for the losses of the postal and telegraph service, there can be no exceptions for the newspaper publishing industry. What we want to ask now is: Is the increase reasonable? If it is unreasonable and implicitly hinders cultural progress, then we should appeal to the government authorities to improve it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>For example, airmail is used to shorten time. In terms of the current domestic transportation situation, we should try our best to use it. However, the measures of the postal authorities seem to be running counter to this. Airmail rates were increased tenfold not long ago. This time, postal rates have been increased again, and the extent of the increase is indeed high, which is really confusing. The postage for one copy of this newspaper by airmail was 274 yuan when it was increased tenfold before. Since this adjustment, it has suddenly increased to 620 yuan, and those that exceed the weight limit by less than 20 centimeters are charged at 150 yuan for every 20 centimeters. However, airline companies did not raise the freight charges during the same period. For example, shipping from Shanghai to Chongqing costs 4,080 yuan per kilogram, which translates to only 40 yuan for every 10 centimeters and 80 yuan for 20 centimeters. And from Shanghai to Nanjing, it costs 720 yuan per kilogram, which translates to only 7.2 yuan for every 10 centimeters and 14.4 yuan for 20 centimeters. However, the postal authorities charge 150 yuan for every 20 centimeters regardless of distance, which is 75 yuan per centimeter, 35 yuan more than the longest distance of Chongqing, and 17 yuan入角 more than the nearest distance of Nanjing. Although this number is small, it adds up, which is indeed considerable. Therefore, there is no problem with the calculation of this postal rate increase. As far as the newspaper industry itself is concerned, the delivery of newspapers is about speed. However, the measures of the postal authorities seem to be hindering the speed of newspaper delivery. No wonder colleagues from all over the country are inevitably emotional about this postal and telegraph rate increase.</p>
<p>Standing from the people's position and thinking for the country, we feel that postal and telegraph rate increases may not be the way to solve the current difficulties. Taking a step back and standing from the newspaper industry's position, we feel that this postal and telegraph rate increase has had too great an unfavorable impact on cultural publishing. If the government has to adopt a rate increase policy, we must appeal to them not to destroy cultural development, and that there can be a preferential approach to newspaper publishing. At least the pricing set must have reasonable regulations and not have an obstructive color.</p>
<h3>Observations on the American Coal Miners' Strike</h3>
<p>The recent American coal miners' strike, with its ups and downs, has astonished the whole world. Since the victory, labor strikes have surged in our country, and have not yet completely subsided. Comparing the two, we find many points that can be thought-provoking.</p>
<p>First, starting with the labor side, from beginning to end, their steps were neat and they abided by the rules. Although there were expressions of indignation at the court's sentences and fines, they did not engage in any other transgressive words or deeds other than seeking relief through legal procedures. During the strike, there were no rude actions such as surrounding the capitalists, destroying factories and mines, etc. When the union leader issued a notice declaring a return to work, all members of the group unanimously obeyed, without any objections. Moreover, there were no dissatisfaction or other malicious speculations about their leader.</p>
<p>Secondly, on the factory owner's side, other than quietly resuming work or reopening negotiations, there was no other action. It seems that they did not have any evil means such as destroying the union, or alienating union members.</p>
<p>Thirdly, on the government's side, the way to resolve it was entirely focused on the judicial aspect, based entirely on the law. Even the President's direct appeal to the workers had to wait until the final moment before being decided, and it was never made public. It was once reported that labor and management were negotiating in secret, but the government claimed not to know about it. The US government's point of view is that this strike was illegal, so it is trying to correct its errors from a legal point of view, and at the same time ordering the whole country to strictly conserve coal, in order to last. As for all strong measures, such as arresting people, sealing off the union, etc., not even a single empty word was heard.</p>
<p>Fourthly, on the side of the general public, because coal is the source of all power and the main fuel for household and factory use, they naturally expressed a very anxious attitude, and at the same time showed considerable disgust towards Lewis's stubborn attitude. This time, Lewis suddenly changed direction, which may have been due to the urging of public opinion. But other than the urging of public opinion, what we heard was only support for the government, universal coal and electricity conservation, and preparation for weathering this difficult encounter. There were no other extraneous accusations against the union or the government. As for the general public who were affected by the coal shortage and were forced to close their factories, they were quietly waiting for the resolution of the strike. The workers were like this, and the factory owners were also like this.</p>
<p>Now that the matter has passed, the American people have all breathed a deep sigh of relief, and we are in the Far East, so of course there is no need to re-mention these past events. The reason for re-mentioning these past events now is that in China, where labor strikes are surging, these various forms seem to be very worthy of savoring. Just imagine, if such a large-scale, nationwide strike were to occur in our country, and the time was extended to two months, what would the situation be like? During this period, would there have been other side issues between labor and management? Would the government have followed the legal track and not taken other emergency measures? Could all the coal and electricity conservation measures be readily launched to the whole country? Could the general public respond to the government's instructions, conserve coal and electricity in unison, and quietly await the judicial verdict? Would the so-called third party add fuel to the fire and make their extraneous articles?</p>
<p>The demand for democracy and the rule of law has now reached its peak, but "the name is the reality of reality." There must be substance to the name. Seeing this "incredible" labor strike in America, we not only have infinite feelings about the previous labor strikes, but it seems that realizing democracy and realizing the rule of law is not just a matter of shouting slogans. Whether it is the government, labor and management, or even the public, the third party, we must abide by laws and disciplines, distinguish right from wrong, and do our best in a pragmatic way, so as not to go off track into a fork in the road.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Gentry Impersonate Officials to Extort Money; Fan Junbo and Others Cannot Shirk Responsibility; City Defense Department Transfers the Entire Case to the District Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>[Suzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 9th] The Suzhou Volunteer Defense Headquarters issued a written statement to the local press on the 9th, stating briefly: This headquarters has repeatedly received secret reports that in mid-September of this year, someone impersonated this headquarters to solicit a huge sum of 30 million yuan from underground money houses.

<h3>Poor Performance in Grain Collection in Anhui Province; Penalties Imposed on Field and Grain Offices in Various Counties</h3>
<p>[Hefei News from Our Newspaper] Among the 63 counties in Anhui Province that are required to collect grain in kind, field and grain offices have been established in 51 counties; for the 12 counties that are required to collect currency in lieu of grain, the offices have been renamed sections.

<h3>Huaiyin Bans Street Vendors and Orders Them to Build Houses for Business in Designated Locations</h3>
<p>[Huaiyin News from Our Newspaper] The Huaiyin Chamber of Commerce recently convened a meeting to discuss measures to ban street vendors in order to rectify the city's appearance. It was resolved to designate Ciyun Temple outside the East City Gate and Zhongzhou at Zhakou as concentrated business venues for street vendors. Each agency will send personnel to count them and order street vendors of each industry to apply for registration with their respective trade associations, and to build factories and houses in designated locations in accordance with the prescribed styles, so as to be tidy and uniform. Afterwards, no street stalls will be allowed to be set up anywhere, which would obstruct traffic. Violators will be submitted to the police station for detention and punishment. However, most of the street vendors are unemployed citizens who live in poverty and sell small profits along the street to make a living. They are still worried about not being able to make ends meet, and they are afraid that they will not have the money to build.</p>

He did not leave his post until after the victory and hid at No. 118 Shanzixiang, Hangzhou. After someone secretly reported to the High Prosecutor's Office in this city, it sent a letter to the Hangzhou District Court to arrest him in Ningbo. After repeated interrogations, he was accused of failing to maintain his integrity, willingly serving the enemy, and holding a puppet position, which undermined the judicial unification of our country and was a clear case of communicating with the enemy and betraying the country, violating the law on punishing traitors. The prosecutor's office filed a public prosecution on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Haoxian County Council Petitions to Remove Surtaxes from Field Taxes</h3>
<p>[Haoxian News from Our Newspaper] Haoxian County collects in-kind field tax in accordance with the standards promulgated by the province, with six offices set up in its subordinate tax areas. From October 1st, collection will be carried out by district, with the tax rate calculated as three bushels and four liters and three 合 of wheat per yuan of surtax and regular tax, that is, each tael of surtax should pay 7.8 yuan, equivalent to two stones and six bushels and seven liters of wheat. Since the announcement of this tax rate, farmers in various tax areas have said that this year's disaster is extremely severe, with poor harvests and surtaxes exceeding twice the amount of regular taxes, making payment difficult. After the county council issued a red letter, it requested the provincial government to approve the removal of the 5.5 角 of surtax per yuan of the set tax rate. It has been submitted to the provincial government for many days. It is now known that the county council wants to remove the excess tax amount and reduce the burden on farmers.

<h3>Joint Security Conference Held by Counties Bordering Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui</h3>
<p>[Our Zhangzhu News] Chuan Jingfang, the commander of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui border suppression zone, held a security conference in Baiyan on the 8th to understand the situation in the jurisdiction and to confer with the relevant leaders on future suppression matters.

<p>[Our Zhangzhu News] The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Border Suppression Command believes that the Yi-Guang Highway is not only an important route between Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, but also of great importance to military travel and transportation in the three provinces.

It is appropriate to mobilize civilian workers to repair it during the post-autumn harvest slack season to facilitate suppression. A telegram was sent to Yixing County Government to comply. The county government has instructed the Zhangzhu District to be responsible for launching the repair work and complete it before the end of December.</p>
<h3>A Battle When Deserters Robbed a Rice Boat - After the Struggle, They Actually Snatched Guns and Fled</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi News] Since this spring, bandits in uniform have been rampant in the city and countryside of this county. On the afternoon of the 7th, five deserters from the Provincial Security Force robbed a rice boat on the edge of Taihu Lake southwest of Meiyuan. Because the boat had an armed escort team, the two sides exchanged fire, and one bandit was killed on the spot. At the same time, Xu Yuanruo, the county magistrate of this county, happened to be traveling in his private car to inspect the Xi-Yi Road. Upon hearing the alarm, he immediately dispatched guards Wang Yushang and Wu Fuyuan, as well as four police officers from the Rongxiang substation, to assist in the arrest. Three bandits were captured, and while being escorted onto the car to be taken to the city for interrogation, because the bandits had not been tied up, they snatched guns and fled. Two escaped, and one was killed on the spot. Another bandit, Wang Hexiang, was captured by the local self-defense force and has been sent to the county for interrogation.</p>

<p>A Clerk at Gaoshengda Makes an Appeal</p>
<p>Although the destruction of Gaoshengda Paper Company has been reported in various newspapers, most of them are vague, leading to misinterpretations. As the accountant, having served the company for 29 years, I can attest that the owner treats people with both kindness and strictness, and the young master, Gao Pengyun, is amiable and approachable, currently studying in the fifth grade at Tongde Medical College. The claims about an inspector are entirely fabricated, creating confusion. On the 30th of last month, at 10 AM, hundreds of vendors gathered in front of the Huangpu Branch, demanding the release of arrested vendors. Failing to achieve their goal, the crowd grew to over a thousand people. The Huangpu Branch, seeing the situation worsen, used fire trucks to spray water and disperse the crowd. However, some of the crowd not only braved the cold water but also threw stones at the police. Nearby shops, fearing accidents, all closed their doors, and our store also put up its shutters. At that time, the owner was not in the store. I instructed my colleagues not to go outside to avoid danger. Unexpectedly, around 6 PM, we suddenly heard someone shouting, "Gaoshengda is spraying water!" A hundred voices echoed the call, and they violently attacked the store door. The police arrived, and the crowd retreated. I went upstairs to investigate and found nothing of the sort. I went downstairs to the front door and shouted loudly to explain, but no one listened. When the police left, the crowd returned and completely destroyed the shutters and glass windows of our store. Then, they rushed into the store, destroying the printing machines, account cabinets, and counters, and threw the goods outside to burn. The burning lasted from 7 PM to 11 PM. The losses at that time were difficult to estimate. On the 1st of this month, we put up bamboo fences to prevent petty thieves. Unexpectedly, at 3 PM, troublemakers again threw iron and cast stones at the glass windows. My colleagues in the store did not make a sound and let it be. Unexpectedly, they tore down the fences, rushed into the store. My colleagues, fearing harm, all fled. At that time, the young owner, Gao Pengyun, unwilling to leave the store, knelt down and begged, hoping to gain their understanding. Not only did they not listen, but he almost suffered an accident. They also completely moved the goods from the warehouse on the second floor and burned them, and the bedding and clothing boxes of the colleagues on the third floor were also affected. The losses were huge, about ten million yuan. The store's losses are currently estimated at over two hundred million yuan. I am 52 years old, my wife is older, and I have neither uncles nor many brothers, let alone nephews. In my 29 years of service at Gaoshengda, my savings, worth over two million yuan in clothing and jewelry, were all looted by the rioters. I cannot claim compensation from the store owner, nor can I seek it from my elder relatives. But half a lifetime of hard work has gone down the drain. How can I not be heartbroken! I beg for the sympathy of all sectors of society to help the store owner, which is to help my colleagues, to resume business as soon as possible and to settle down as soon as possible. I hereby report the factual circumstances and my pitiful feelings in the newspaper, which can also serve as a sad page in my decades of history! (Zhao Menglong)</p>
<p>Strange! A Household Registration Investigation?</p>
<p>Near Cangnan Gate in Yongfeng Town, Songjiang County, there is a self-defense corps stationed from Kuatang Town. Around 7 PM on the 4th of this month, I returned to my hometown from Shanghai and went to a relative's house first. My wife was also there. Unexpectedly, we heard a shout to open the door. At that time, my relatives were extremely frightened, not knowing what was happening. However, we had no choice but to open the door. We saw a group of people carrying guns, with no manners, rushing into the house and shouting, "Household registration investigation!" At that time, my heart was calm. Unexpectedly, they checked my ID card. I explained that I worked for a newspaper and showed them my badge. They insisted that I was impersonating someone and argued for a long time before leaving grudgingly. May I ask, when they investigated household registrations, they had neither household registration books nor the presence of the local village chief. Moreover, their uniforms were not neat. I earnestly hope that the authorities will promptly investigate this kind of blitz-style household registration investigation to maintain security. (Zhuang Yongzhang)</p>
<h3>Wuhu - Everything Cannot Stand the Test: A Perspective on the Core Area of Anhui Province</h3>
<p>— By Bai Yuwen, Special Correspondent of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Although the Anhui Provincial Government is located in Hefei, it is merely the seat of the provincial government. The province's economic and political center of gravity remains in Wuhu. Southern Anhui is the wealthy region of the entire province, exporting more than 10 million shi of grain from Wuhu each year, earning a large amount of banknotes and goods, which are then distributed from Wuhu to all counties in southern Anhui. It is the breathing tube of Anhui. With its location on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and its well-developed river, sea, ship, railway, and highway transportation, its position has become increasingly important. The people of Anhui love Wuhu and value it even more. What is Wuhu like now?</p>
<p>Construction</p>
<p>There were too many upstarts during the occupation period, and because there was no major battle when the enemy invaded Wuhu, the degree of destruction was far less than that of Hunan and Guangxi. Zhongshan Road, Zhenglu, Erjie Road, and the roads have seen many more new-style buildings than before the war. At the beginning of the victory, the newly arrived officials and celebrities were particularly interested in construction. The victorious country needed victorious decorations, which was naturally right. The opening of the Huantang Road in the refugee area and the construction of the Zhongshan Memorial Hall, planting foreign trees on the sidewalks, and spending tens of millions or hundreds of millions of yuan, although people from Shanghai and Nanjing still found Wuhu pitifully small when they first arrived, those from the inland, strolling on the road, seeing neon lights, and hearing radios, thought that Shanghai was no more than that. Zhang Weixia, the Administrative Inspector of the Sixth District, initially concurrently served as the director of the Municipal Preparation Office. Zhang has indelible achievements in the construction of Wuhu City. Many buildings have his inscription, and Huantang Road has been officially named "Weixia" Road. But heaven was never going to stop raining, and the road immediately turned into a paddy field for transplanting rice seedlings. For several days, model boats could be floated on both sides of the Erjie Road, and the shops and houses on both sides turned into flower boats on the Qinhuai River, with everyone building gangways to get ashore. Even a deaf person has ears, and the name of the ear and its appearance still have some function. Then the sidewalks of Wuhu still qualify as the ears of a deaf person. The wide places of the sidewalks are two or three feet wide, and the narrow places are probably only one foot wide. In this narrow space, we still have to plant sidewalk trees. If people can walk like snakes, it's nothing. Some trees are planted right in the middle of the shop's front door. If you don't pay attention, you will rush straight out from the house and collide with the tree. The Zhongshan Memorial Hall was completed in less than a few months, costing more than 140 million yuan, and now it is leaking rain and is about to collapse. The Council has raised serious questions about this. The Zhongshan Bridge cost tens of millions of yuan last year, but it has not yet started construction, and the contractor has run away. These are all construction projects. Regardless of whether they are beneficial or not, even if they are harmful, we do the same as other places do. It's not that we are unwilling to do things.</p>
<p>Public Security</p>
<p>There is a certain rule about what clothes to wear at what time and what things to know. Preventing epidemics in summer and preventing theft in winter are considered central tasks by officials and gentry. Before Wuhu entered winter defense, thieves were ignorant of the times and ran rampant. Perhaps it was because they were not within the scope of winter defense, and few people cared. The time for winter defense had long passed, and everyone seemed to be concentrating on preventing thieves. Startling alarm reports were sounded several times every night, indicating that it was winter defense curfew. The thieves were simply unreasonable. Only last night at 6 o'clock, in the densely populated Changjie Street, three bandits suddenly broke into the Wenfushanfang Bookstore and Zhuangde Bookstore. They failed to rob money and openly opened fire, killing the bookstore owner, Huang Youquan. The night before last at 8 o'clock, when the Zhongshan Memorial Hall was showing a movie, some of the students in the audience fought with the movie theater. At the same time, someone was setting off firecrackers for a wedding, which made everyone think that something big had happened. A police alarm was sounded first, and the military and police were dispatched everywhere, announcing a temporary curfew. The shops on the road were baffled and closed their doors one after another, and pedestrians hurried home in panic. It wasn't until a few hours later that they realized it was a false alarm.</p>
<p>Commerce</p>
<p>Wuhu is a commercial port on the Yangtze River. In addition to the Zhongjiao, Nong, Shanghai, Industrial, Provincial, and County eight banks, there are more than 60 illegal money houses. There are many department stores and cloth shops. The broadcasting of the broadcasters is so loud that even cars cannot hear them. Bands are desperately blowing and beating in the windows of the shops and on the streets. The people of Wuhu probably love music too much. They use bands for business promotion, weddings, funerals, meetings, openings, and when the secretary-general is transferred, they send gifts and rewards to the band. At all times, they are blowing and beating. Wuhu seems to be a paradise on the surface. But if you talk to people in the business community, look at the advertisements for clearing accounts in the newspapers, and the debt disputes, the entire business arena is collapsing. Except for a very few, all are relying on high-interest loans to support their facade. After the end of the winter, it is predicted that less than two-thirds of the stores will be able to go public after the Spring Festival. The shops in Wuhu's largest joint commercial arena, such as Dahua and Guohuo Company, are closing down one after another, leaving only three or four stores, deserted and deserted. Guohuo Company is selling real estate and clearing debts. Yesterday, a creditor forcibly moved away the goods sealed by the company, resulting in litigation. Prices rise every day, affecting wages. The survival of industry and commerce feels threatened, and the number of unemployed people is increasing. Temporary relief and winter relief cannot solve this serious problem.</p>
<p>Everything in Wuhu cannot stand the test. A fat man cannot stand a single blow. Living one day at a time! Everyone lives and waits with this feeling. (November 28)</p>

<h3>Gu Weijun's Speech Supports India - South Africa Should Not Discriminate Against Race - UN General Assembly Adopts Political Committee Resolution for Negotiations Between the Two Countries - Discussion of the Troop Investigation Case Yields No Results</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 8th Dispatch] My chief representative, Gu Weijun, recently stated that China will do its utmost to support India's accusation against South Africa for mistreating Indians. Mr. Gu voted in the General Assembly in favor of a resolution urging South Africa to comply with its obligations under the United Nations Charter and not to engage in racial discrimination. He pointed out that although this matter is only a legal issue in some respects, it is actually an extremely important political issue. The relationship between these two United Nations member states is not only damaged, but completely obstructed. When he mentioned the seriousness of the situation between the two countries, he said that the United Nations should be responsible for dealing with this matter immediately, and said that South Africa's discriminatory laws are not only enforced on Indians, but also on people from all Asian countries, including Chinese people. He also said that China's sponsorship of this draft resolution is not because it is related to China itself, but only because China is a member of the United Nations. When discussing South Africa's proposal to submit this matter to the newly established World Court for handling, Mr. Gu said that this move may have unfortunate consequences, because (1) if the court believes that the United Nations has jurisdiction over this matter, then the General Assembly will have to deal with this matter again, which will delay the issue. (2) If the court believes that this issue is a domestic matter in South Africa, it will not help solve the problem and will make India dissatisfied. (3) If the court's opinions are divided, it will lose its reputation. Mr. Gu asked, is it fair for us to place such a heavy burden on the World Court? Prior to this, ten representatives had expressed doubts about whether there was a legal obligation on this matter internationally. Mr. Gu replied that the Chinese delegation believes that there should be an international duty on this matter based on the 1926 Cape Town Agreement. He also said that apart from this matter, any country that has signed the United Nations Charter has international obligations.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 9th Dispatch] The UN General Assembly held a plenary session today and adopted the Political Security Committee's resolution on the dispute between South Africa and India with a majority of 32 votes to 15, with seven abstentions. The resolution stipulates that India and South Africa should hold direct negotiations on the treatment of the Indian minority in South Africa and submit a report to the next session of the General Assembly to ensure that the treatment of South African Indians is consistent with the provisions of the agreements between the two countries and the principles of the Atlantic Charter. Earlier, there was a debate on the amendment proposed by South African Prime Minister Smuts. Mr. Smuts requested that the case be submitted to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for arbitration to determine whether the UN General Assembly has the power to interfere in the internal affairs of a member state, which was firmly supported by British representative Shawcross. Soviet representative Vyshinsky refuted, "This case is absolutely international in nature, because this move violates the separate agreements signed by the two independent governments in 1927 and 1932, which guarantee each other's immigrants. It is very clear that this case cannot be classified as a judicial issue. The South African government's actions to discriminate against Indians are numerous. It initially claimed that these people were Jews, and now it has failed morally and is using legal issues as an excuse." At this point, Indian representative Mrs. Pandit stood up and questioned Shawcross on how the judgment of the International Court of Justice was normally done. Mrs. Pandit said, "Mr. Shawcross is clinging to the current situation in India when debating the issue of Indian minorities. This kind of irony is irrelevant to the issue itself. Furthermore, the British should bear most of the responsibility for the current situation in India. Please pay attention to this, Mr. Shawcross. We know that the whole world respects human rights, justice, and loyalty, and the whole world is a friend of those who are oppressed." Smuts' amendment was finally rejected by 21 votes to 21, with two abstentions.</p>
<p>[Our News] New York, 9th. Broadcast: The United Nations General Assembly is discussing the issue of troop investigation in various countries. The British representative advocated establishing an inspection system to investigate whether the figures reported by various countries are accurate. Molotov expressed opposition, saying that the issue of foreign troops should not be confused with the issue of domestic troops. The two sides debated fiercely, and there was no result. It was changed to be discussed again today.</p>
<h3>Political Group Passes Resolution - Severing Diplomatic Relations with the Franco Regime - Madrid Demonstrates to Protest Against the United Nations</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Lake Success, 9th Dispatch] The amendment proposed by five Latin American countries on the Spanish issue, advocating that the United Nations sever diplomatic relations with Franco, was passed yesterday by the Political and Security Committee by a vote of 11 to 6. Venezuela, Yugoslavia, Chile, Byelorussia, Panama, France, Guatemala, Mexico, Norway, Poland, and the Soviet Union voted in favor. China, Cuba, Colombia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States voted against. The Belgian representative abstained. As for the draft resolution proposed by the United States, it merely called on the Spanish people to organize "an acceptable government to replace the government led by Franco." The committee continued its meeting today and passed a proposal to prohibit France from purchasing food from Franco's Spain by a vote of 11 to 5, with two abstentions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 9th Dispatch] The Anglo-Americans strongly opposed the passage of the severance of diplomatic relations with the Franco regime by the subcommittee on the Spanish issue. It is expected that the case will not win the statutory two-thirds majority in the General Assembly vote.</p>
<p>[Our News] London, 9th Broadcast: Madrid held an officially authorized demonstration. Franco gave a speech to the public, saying that Spain could not tolerate foreign interference in Spain's internal affairs. Franco made this statement when the UN's opposition to Franco's rhetoric was heating up, which was obviously a warning against the UN's interference in Spain's internal affairs.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 9th Dispatch] Several bombs exploded in Barcelona, and the front of the youth league headquarters building there was destroyed by the bombs. It is reported that the city's left-wing groups have scheduled a general strike today to protest against the government-authorized grand demonstration. At the same time, resistance members in Madrid issued a declaration exposing the Falange members for oppressing workers and forcing them to participate in Franco's demonstration.</p>

Truman suggested submitting the partition plan to the London roundtable conference to be held in January next year, at which time the United States will send representatives to observe. Bevin returned to New York today.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 9th (Radio): After Iranian Prime Minister Sultan announced that government troops had entered Azerbaijan province, it immediately aroused a reaction from Azerbaijan province leader Pishavari. He called on students and other youths to arm themselves and issued a statement saying that the people of the province would resist the government troops entering Azerbaijan province, and if necessary, would continue to attack, directly striking Tehran. Sultan dispatched planes to fly over Tabriz, dropping leaflets explaining that the government troops entered Azerbaijan province only to monitor the election, and said: "If Azerbaijan province truly belongs to Iranian territory, then the government troops have the right to act freely."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 8th] It is learned that the Iranian government forces, based in Qazvin, continue to advance, sweeping and eliminating the remnants of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party's army along the way. However, as of now, they have not yet reached the border of Azerbaijan province. Other government forces are currently "exploring the enemy's lines" on the eastern border of Azerbaijan province. In addition, the Iranian general election, originally scheduled to begin today, has been postponed because the police failed to arrive in time to "protect" the polling stations. According to the new parliamentary general election, it will be held simultaneously throughout the country (except for Azerbaijan province). However, political figures speculate that the general election may not be held within a week. Election campaigns have not yet begun throughout the country. Even in Tehran, voters are still unaware of the list of candidates. On the other hand, the mayor of Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan province, has ordered all voters to prepare for the election. Prime Minister Sultan specifically telegraphed the governor of Azerbaijan province, Yavari, issuing a warning to him, saying that since the leader of Azerbaijan province does not allow government troops to enter Azerbaijan province, even if Tabriz holds a general election, it will still be regarded as invalid. Tehran Radio is still continuing to broadcast, constantly exposing the claims of Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 9th] Iranian Cabinet Prime Minister Sultan last night announced for the first time that Iranian government forces were attacked by Azerbaijan province troops. The communique stated: "Azerbaijan province guerrillas gathered in the Qiaflankoh district (near the Mianeh-Tabriz highway) and opened fire on government troops. If the actions of the Azerbaijan province leader threaten the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iran, then the government, in order to fulfill its duties, will spare no expense."</p>
<p>Furthermore: An Iranian government plane dropped leaflets over Azerbaijan province today, asking the people to rise up and resist the Azerbaijan "democratic government."</p>
<h3>Communists Conduct Anti-American Propaganda in South America</h3>
<p>Former U.S. Secretary of State Welles Broadcasts</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Former Secretary of State Welles stated in a national broadcast today that the Communist Party is lobbying the Latin American republics, accusing the United States of engaging in imperialist and capitalist policies and exploiting the South American republics. Welles also stated that in recent years, the Communist parties of the South American republics have been targeting civilians for propaganda, using the U.S. government's mistakes in recent years as tools for anti-propaganda.</p>
<h3>My Representative's Proposal Rejected; Veto Power Remains a Pending Issue; Disarmament Committee Debates Much, Accomplishes Little</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 8th] The UN Political Committee recently passed a resolution proposed by Australia on the issue of the use of the veto power. The resolution requests the five permanent members of the Security Council to guarantee that the exercise of the veto power will not hinder the Security Council from quickly reaching resolutions, and suggests quickly adopting measures to reduce the difficulties in exercising the veto power. It also requests the Security Council to seriously consider the opinions put forward by the member states of the United Nations when formulating the aforementioned measures.</p>
<p>The proposals put forward by the Chinese delegation requesting the Security Council to take steps to enable the exercise of the veto power to promote the speedy adoption of resolutions by the Council, and the proposal put forward by the Cuban delegation to convene a general assembly of the member states of the United Nations to discuss the veto power and consider amending the Charter, were all rejected.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, date not given] The Political Committee's subcommittee engaged in formulating a plan for disarmament and banning atomic weapons. After a long debate yesterday, no agreement was reached. Soviet representative Vyshinsky still stated that the veto power is only exercised in the Security Council and should not be exercised in the committee controlling armaments. However, he also said that the Security Council should be primarily responsible for the disarmament issue. British representative Lankruth stated that the Security Council should indicate the power of the control committee in the agreement signed by the member states, and the committee should have absolute independence in exercising these powers.</p>
<h3>UN Trusteeship Committee Passes Indian Proposal</h3>
<p>Southwest Africa Under International Trusteeship</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 8th] Regarding the issue of the South African Union's request to merge Southwest Africa, the UN Trusteeship Committee held a meeting to discuss it. The draft resolution proposed by India, advocating that Southwest Africa should be placed under international trusteeship, and that its administering power should prepare a draft trusteeship agreement in accordance with Article 79 of the United Nations Charter and submit it to the United Nations organization, has been passed by the Trusteeship Committee.</p>
<h3>Results of the French Senate Re-election; People's Party Has Only One More Seat Than the Communist Party</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, date not given] The electors of the French provinces began electing senators of the French Fourth Republic today. As of 11:15 pm tonight (Greenwich Mean Time), the results obtained in mainland France and French Algeria showed that a total of 214 senators were elected. The People's Republican Movement Party only has one more seat than the Communist Party. The number of seats obtained by each party is as follows: Among the 100 senators from mainland France, 127 were directly elected by the "electors." Among these 127 seats, the People's Republican Party occupies 54 seats, the Communist Party occupies 32 seats, and the Socialist Party occupies 12 seats. Therefore, the number of seats obtained by the People's Republican Party is far more than that of the Communist Party. As for the remaining 73 of the 200 senators from mainland France, they are allocated according to the proportion of votes obtained by each party in the primary election. Therefore, the result is that the number of seats obtained by the Communist Party is only one seat less than that of the People's Republican Party. According to political observers, the Senate of the Republic will have a total of 315 senators. In addition to the 214 already elected, there are still 101 to be elected. Fifty of them will be elected by the National Assembly, and fifty-one will be elected by the councils of the overseas territories. It is expected that the People's Republican Party will probably have a greater advantage in the Senate. The Senate of the Republic will open at the end of this year, and its first task will be to elect the President of the Republic together with the National Assembly. The Senate of the Republic will also review the laws and bills approved by the National Assembly and can provide opinions. It is also necessary to consult the Senate before declaring war.</p>
<h3>Acheson Outlines the U.S. Relief Plan</h3>
<p>Denies Using Food as a Political Weapon</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th (Special Dispatch)] U.S. Under Secretary of State Acheson recently broadcast that the outside world's claim that the United States refuses to participate in international relief efforts because it does not want to cooperate with countries around the world, and that the United States attempts to use food as a political weapon, is not true. Acheson continued, saying that he is asking Congress for generous funding for the emergency needs of three or four European countries for next year's relief efforts. The American people and Congress have decided not to place large amounts of property in locations where the United States cannot control these funds. Acheson briefly outlined the U.S.'s plan to continue providing necessary relief as follows: (1) First, countries should immediately consider what contributions they can make to relief efforts after the UN is abolished. (2) Every country in need of assistance obtains the UN's approval. (3) The United Nations Secretariat should be the place to accept the plans of the relevant countries. Acheson said that under this arrangement, countries receiving relief must prove their poverty and must be responsible for providing relief regardless of political views.</p>
<h3>Nuqrashi Ordered to Form New Egyptian Cabinet</h3>
<p>Sidqi Explains Reasons for Resignation</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 9th] After Egyptian Prime Minister Sidqi resigned, King Farouk appointed Nuqrashi to form a new cabinet.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 8th] Former Prime Minister Sidqi issued a communique this afternoon, stating that when the Egyptian cabinet resigned, it still maintained the principle of joint administration of Sudan, and expressed regret that the Sudan Governor-General issued a declaration by order of London before reaching an agreement with the Egyptian side. Sudan President Huddleston, with the consent of Prime Minister Attlee, issued a statement stating that the Sudanese government will not be affected by others and will continue to prepare for the autonomy of the Sudanese people and allow them to freely choose the future status of Sudan. A person close to Sidqi said: Sidqi believes that this statement is equivalent to the British side unilaterally deciding with Sudan, which is equivalent to the British side destroying the Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiation. It is said that the main reason for the resignation of the Egyptian Prime Minister was because of this.</p>
<h3>Wei Lihuang Arrives in the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press, California, Elfert, 9th] General Wei Lihuang and his wife arrived here today from Hawaii on a British Army transport plane. They will inspect military bases and other facilities throughout the United States. Brigadier General Rendell, commander of the San Antonio Army, welcomed him at the airport. Rendell worked with Wei in China for two years.</p>
<h3>Indian Constituent Assembly Opens; Muslim League Representatives Refuse to Participate; British Proposal to Divide Provinces Draws Criticism</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 9th] The Indian Constituent Assembly solemnly opened in the Constitution Hall today, in order to implement the second stage of the Indian independence plan. The atmosphere was quite solemn, but the 75 seats of the Muslim League were empty because the Muslim League boycotted the assembly. When the 221 representatives of the Congress Party and small parties entered the venue, mounted and foot police guarded the area around the hall, and vehicles and pedestrians were not allowed to pass. At the opening, the dark clouds that had笼单over New Delhi for two days suddenly cleared, and the sun shone brightly. After the opening, Congress Party leader Kripalani walked past the party representatives, including Nehru, and delivered a short speech, introducing the interim chairman Sinha, who is seventy-eight years old and the oldest representative in the assembly.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 9th] India will enter an important week today. The Congress Party Executive Committee is scheduled to meet today to review the statement issued by the British government after the end of the London talks. Nehru will arrive in time to attend, and the Constituent Assembly will definitely open today. The League has already stated that it does not intend to participate. The Congress Party representative of Ajmer-Merwara indicated yesterday that some Congress Party members will also refuse to participate in the Constituent Assembly. They oppose dividing the provinces of India into several groups for the purpose of constitution-making. If the British government's provincial division system cannot be withdrawn, then they will refuse to attend the Constituent Assembly. The Sikhs also oppose the division of provinces. A Sikh representative said that since it is recognized that the constitution cannot force a group of people who are unwilling to accept it, there is a division of provinces, but if within a province, such as Punjab province, because 60 million Muslims are willing to accept a certain constitution, how can 12 million Sikhs and Hindus be forced to accept it. The original suggestion was to divide the provinces of India into three categories. According to the British document of May 16, each province has the right to choose which category of province to join after the constitution is completed. The Congress Party explained that each province has the right to choose from the beginning. The statement submitted to the British government yesterday stated that this difference in interpretation should be decided by the Federal Court, and the resolution should be accepted by both parties. It is reported that the Congress Party is prepared to accept the ruling of the Federal Court.</p>

<h3>After Coal Mine Strike Resolved, American Life Returns to Normal; Congress to Discuss Amending Labor Law</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 9th (Radio): American coal miners returned to work today, marking the end of the 17-day strike.</p>
<p>[Our Washington Correspondent, 9th (Special Dispatch)] After the United Mine Workers of America President Lewis expressed his submission to President Truman and issued a return-to-work order, the local authorities are quietly waiting for the reaction of the coal miners. Generally, people are quite optimistic about the rapid restoration of coal production, but the government authorities expect that the repercussions caused by this major strike will make the disputes between the Congress, the courts, and the coal miners remain unresolved for a long time. According to news from the mining area, the coal miners have rarely expressed opposition to the return-to-work order, probably because they have repeatedly decided to strike this year, and the coal miners have lost more than eight weeks of wages. It is generally expected that the coal mines will resume work on Monday morning, but production will not return to normal until Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 8th] After the United Mine Workers of America President Lewis unconditionally surrendered to the government, his movement to demand wage increases has been frustrated. The mine owners are now quietly waiting for further actions by the government and whether Congress will discuss the new labor law in January next year. Various industries affected by the coal mine strike are planning to return to normal. 300,000 unemployed workers must wait for coal supplies to arrive before they can resume work. After the end of the strike, various coal restrictions at home and abroad have actually been lifted. This Christmas will be brightly lit, stores can have more goods, public places can restore heating equipment, and large parcels will resume delivery.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Members of Congress today expressed their determination to discuss the new labor law, but hinted that the submission of the United Mine Workers of America President Lewis has dispelled the final severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Situation Tense on the Greek-Yugoslav Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, 8th] It is reported that there was a fierce battle near Gevgelija on the Greek-Yugoslav border. The Yugoslav authorities have locked down the border traffic from Amoprustun to Greek Macedonia. Another unconfirmed report stated that several Greek planes invaded Yugoslav territory at that location and were shot at by Yugoslav artillery fire. UN personnel said they saw planes dive and strafe on the border and heard dense artillery fire from within Greece.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 8th] Greek Deputy Prime Minister Tsouderos confirmed that the Yugoslav government has submitted a protest letter to the Greek ambassador to Yugoslavia regarding the intrusion of Greek planes into Yugoslav territory. The Greek government will conduct an investigation before responding.</p>

<h3>The Truth of the "Miyazaki Incident" is Revealed; The Eight-One-Three Conspiracy is Exposed</h3>
<p>[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 9th] After the Eight-One-Three Incident, Japan fabricated various stories in an attempt to find an excuse to launch an invasion. At that time, there was the so-called "Miyazaki Incident." Today, Private First Class Miyazaki, who was lightly reported by the Japanese, suddenly declared from his hometown of Hiroshima that he is still alive and stated that the August 13th disaster was caused by the Japanese army by way of excuse. The truth of the "Miyazaki Incident" is now revealed. According to Miyazaki, on July 4, 1937, taking advantage of the opportunity to go out, he decided to escape and sneaked into a British ship, but was discovered. He then jumped into the river and was rescued by the Chinese and taken to Nanjing. Soon after, he saw his photo published in Japanese newspapers, publicizing the "Miyazaki unlawful kidnapping incident." Miyazaki was greatly shocked and rushed to surrender and was sent to Shanghai. For the sake of face, the Japanese army did not want to reveal the truth and strictly prohibited the publication of the news of Miyazaki's return. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the crime of embezzling military property and was sent to the Kojima Prison to serve his sentence. He was only released on parole in April this year and is currently engaged in food production in his hometown.</p>
<p>The outfit worn by members of Admiral Byrd's Antarctic expedition (Special dispatch from The New York Times)</p>
<h3>Humanity's Gaze Turns to Antarctica; American Expedition Team Conducts Scientific Research</h3>
<p>— (Written by Franz of the Associated Press; translated by our translation room)</p>
<p>Antarctica, with an area equivalent to two Europes, and the surrounding waters, has now become America's vast scientific research laboratory.</p>
<p>Long before the survey team led by Rear Admiral Byrd, comprising more than twenty-five prominent scientists and two hundred researchers (a total of 4,000 personnel including all support staff), set sail, all available information directly related to this "bottom of the world" had been collected, organized, and analyzed for use by the expedition personnel.</p>
<p>Many scientific departments of the government have sent their own personnel to participate in this survey team, preparing to transfer the observations obtained in the following scientific fields, such as electronics, marine biology, atmospheric dynamics, medicine, mineralogy, refrigeration, and agriculture, to civilian enterprises in the future.</p>
<p>Experts believe that the Antarctic region is indeed the most ideal laboratory for experimenting with the use of knowledge and methods developed in the war during peacetime. Most of the phenomena in Antarctica are still isolated from humans and have not been discovered. Therefore, this exploration, which is carried out using airplanes or submarines, has the effect of advancing the boundaries of human knowledge.</p>
<p>In terms of the scope of the problem and the scale of rapid concentration of manpower and material resources, apart from the Manhattan Project completed by the Army in the past to develop the atomic bomb, there is nothing comparable to this Navy's Antarctic survey work.</p>
<p>Decades ago, the exploration of the polar regions was entirely a matter of navigation technology on the water, and a matter of the limits of human cold resistance on land. Geographic boundaries were advancing rapidly like a dog-sled. Currently, the edge of this six million square miles of known area is advancing at a rate of three hundred miles per hour.</p>
<p>This survey will apply the world's newest and most sophisticated aircraft, propellers, radar, aerial cameras, sonic depth finders, snowmobiles, dehydrated foods, and aerial ore detectors to explore undiscovered mineral deposits in technical work.</p>
<p>Although there are so many modern tools, the key to success still lies in two simple and old factors, namely, keeping hands warm in the absolute cold of Antarctica and the physical strength of sled dogs, which is necessary in some cases for land surveys.</p>
<p>For high-altitude flights, we already have special clothing that keeps the human body warm, but keeping the temperature of the hands of mechanics working on aircraft warm in the polar regions is still a technically difficult problem.</p>
<p>Early Antarctic exploration reports mentioned large deposits of bituminous coal and trace amounts of copper, gold, and manganese. Large-scale exploration has never been done before. When the Navy Antarctic Survey Plan's first informal report was published, people immediately speculated that one of its purposes was to find uranium ore.</p>
<p>Hibernating U.S. Warships</p>
<p>With the enemy kneeling and the atmosphere of war dissipating, the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force are all exhibiting a remarkable phenomenon. In the Navy department, all warships and merchant ships are now quietly moored in the harbor, entering a period of hibernation. The cannons on board are all tightly wrapped with plastic film and sprayed with layers of resin to seal and protect them, so as to make them immortal for a long time. When the time comes, none will be materials of no use, therefore, the stage of hibernation is likely to be the eve before the spring awakening.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from The New York Times)</p>
<p>A portion of the U.S. Sixteenth Fleet, totaling twenty-five naval vessels and merchant ships, is now quietly moored in the harbor.</p>
<p>Workers tightly wrap the cannons of warships and spray resin on them to create a protective effect, so that they will not decay even after a long time.</p>
<p>After wrapping and sealing, technicians inspect the internal condition, especially strictly checking whether the temperature is kept dry and whether the climate is normal.</p>

<h3>New Shantytowns Prohibited Within Designated Zones; Demolition Begins Tomorrow; Public Works and Police Bureaus Explain Management and Enforcement Measures; Citywide, There Are Over 40,000 Shantytown Households</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Authorities have decided to begin enforcing the prohibition of building shantytowns within the designated Cai Li District starting tomorrow (the 11th). Existing shantytowns will be permitted to remain. However, if any obstruct traffic or span over waterways, requiring demolition, efforts will be made to provide alternative solutions for relocation. Starting tomorrow, the Municipal Public Works Bureau will, in conjunction with the Police Bureau, organize a patrol team. Relevant supervisors from both bureaus will lead police and workmen to patrol various districts. If newly erected, incomplete shantytowns are found within the prohibited construction zones, workmen will be instructed to assist in demolition, returning the materials to the builders for construction in non-prohibited areas.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at 10:30 AM, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, and Fang Zhichao, Director of the Administrative Division of the Police Bureau, jointly met with reporters at the Municipal Government to explain the management and enforcement measures regarding new shantytowns. Director Zhao first explained that the construction of shantytowns was due to housing shortages and the economic problems faced by both military and civilians. In fact, the Municipal Government encourages housing construction to solve the housing shortage and permits shantytown construction, but with restrictions. These restrictions ensure no hinderance to hygiene, fire prevention, and public order. Although the Municipal Government has announced measures to prohibit shantytowns, enforcement will be lenient. However, shantytown construction in prohibited areas has increased unabated. Currently, including those built during the occupation, there are approximately 40,000 households. Of these, 2,708 households have applied for licenses, but only 468 have been granted, leaving the remainder as illegal structures. The city's population is estimated at over four million. To safeguard the safety of the majority, the interests of a few must be sacrificed. Considering summer hygiene and winter fire prevention, these shantytowns are harmful to all residents. Furthermore, some individuals occupy public or private land, building houses for business and sale, which cannot be tolerated. This decision was approved at the municipal meeting on the 2nd of this month, with representatives from the Municipal Council, the Local Court, and the Procuratorate in attendance.</p>
<p>Director Zhao also reported that the licensing procedure has been improved for convenience. Ordinary construction permits can usually be issued within one to two weeks, and miscellaneous permits, such as for repairs or shantytown construction, can be issued within five days.</p>
<p>Director Fang then stated that the police exercise state authority on behalf of the nation, executing duties according to laws and regulations without arbitrary actions. However, officers may sometimes act firmly when executing orders. The public should not misunderstand. Municipal administration must consider future policies. We should not only address immediate needs at the expense of the overall plan. Currently, the Public Works Bureau and the Police Bureau have jointly petitioned the Municipal Government to instruct the Land Bureau to designate areas for shantytown construction. Before such areas are designated, existing shantytowns will be managed without strict enforcement. Those being constructed or nearing completion will be ordered to be demolished.</p>
<h3>Jiangwan Armory: Intermittent Explosions; Thorough Investigation of the Cause; Risky Inspection of the Armory; Four Charred Bodies Unearthed Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The First Sub-Depot of the Second Ordnance Reserve Depot of the Logistics Headquarters experienced an ammunition explosion. Yesterday afternoon, the depot became quiet. The responsible authorities began to actively work on the aftermath, starting with extinguishing the remaining fires, then searching for bodies and assessing the damage. Yesterday, a total of four bodies were found. One was reduced to only an abdomen, another to the lower half of the body, and the other two were charred beyond recognition.</p>
<p>After the incident occurred, relevant authorities in the capital attached great importance to it. The Logistics Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense dispatched Major General Lei Zhaojie, a specialist from the Field Operations Department, to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation. Mao Sen, Director of the Garrison Headquarters of the Capital and Shanghai, was sent to assist in the investigation. Yesterday morning, they, along with Commander Fu of the First Supply Zone, ventured into the exploded armory for inspection. Our reporter followed inside and saw fragments of ammunition and rubble everywhere. The heat from the ground was scorching. Firefighters continued to pour water inside, while engineers began digging. A burnt truck wreck and four charred bodies were discovered in the southern part of the warehouse. It is believed that these were the remains of transport soldiers who were close to the explosion site at the time. Several more bodies may be located in other parts of the warehouse, but excavation could not continue due to the high ground temperature. As of yesterday evening, no further discoveries have been reported.</p>
<p>The reporter then went to Lu Jiyun, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Logistics Headquarters. According to him, while the cause of the explosion has not been determined, the most likely scenario is that a hand grenade accidentally detonated upon impact. According to warehouse soldiers who escaped with injuries, they were unloading three trucks of hand grenades from the First Supply Station of the Zhejiang Supply Bureau using a line transfer method. They were standing close to the outside of the warehouse, and no unauthorized personnel were allowed inside. No anomalies were observed. Suddenly, a loud explosion occurred. Some believe that hand grenades do not easily explode. However, all ammunition explosions are due to heat reaching a certain level. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that dropping a whole box of hand grenades onto a cement floor could cause friction and heat in the internal explosives, leading to an explosion. The number of casualties is confirmed to be less than what was rumored. Five warehouse soldiers were injured, and seven were initially unaccounted for. Four bodies have now been found, leaving only three unaccounted for. The details of the damage cannot be determined because the fire area has not been completely cleared. The department has records of the ammunition stored, and a detailed breakdown will be available soon.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Commander Fu told reporters that he plans to host a briefing in the coming days for the Shanghai press to report the details and handling of the incident. Regarding rumors of a suspect being arrested, it has not been confirmed.</p>
<h3>City Party Committee Sent Representatives to Comfort Nearby Residents Yesterday</h3>
<p>Fang Zhi, Director of the City’s Education Department, after learning of the explosion at the Second Ordnance Depot of the First Supply Zone at the Jiangwan Stadium, expressed great concern for nearby residents. Yesterday, he sent Chen Baotai, Director of the Organization and Training Department, to the Wujiaochang area of Jiangwan to provide comfort. Residents in the vicinity had fled to avoid shrapnel injuries after the incident. Upon hearing that the explosions had stopped, they gradually returned. Director Chen’s visits comforted them.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit "Anti-Currency" Case Concluded in Court; "North Sea Bank" Not Approved According to Law; Defense Argues Whether It Qualifies as a Bank</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon, the court held a hearing on the counterfeit "Anti-Currency," "North Sea Bank" note case, questioning the five defendants: Ye Songmao, Yan Bingshui, Yang Peisheng, Lu Guoshu, and Tang Qifang. The trial was concluded in one session, with the verdict scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 14th of this month.</p>
<p>On September 20th of this year, the Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters uncovered an Anti-Currency (North Sea Bank) printing press at 207 Mongolia Road, arresting five suspects and confiscating printing machines and printing plates. The case attracted much attention, often viewed through a political lens. Zhou Enlai and Chen Jiakang of the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party immediately issued statements. Subsequently, the Garrison Headquarters transferred the case to the District Procuratorate, which concluded its investigation and filed a public prosecution. The indictment stated that Liu Jianqing and Han Fuyu (two fugitives), friends of the defendant Yang Peisheng, came to Shanghai from the Communist-occupied area of Shandong in July of this year. They brought several 200-yuan notes issued by the North Sea Bank, established by the Communist Party. Being destitute, they discussed with Yang Peisheng the idea of counterfeiting North Sea Bank notes to be used in the Communist areas near Shandong and Xuzhou. Using the notes they had as models, Yang Peisheng introduced Yan Bingshui for printing around September 10th. An initial payment of 1.25 million legal tender was made. Later, Yan Bingshui, having used up the funds and under pressure from Yang Peisheng and others, introduced Ye Songmao (owner of the Ye Fansheng Printing Shop) to print the notes, agreeing to print 40 million face value of North Sea Bank notes at a cost of 1 million legal tender. However, Yan Bingshui falsely claimed to Lu Guoshu that the cost was 2 million, pocketing 1 million. Yan Bingshui supervised the printing. The required funds were guaranteed by Yang Peisheng, who asked his friend Lu Guoshu to borrow from Tang Qifang, who was aware of the situation. A total of over 5.4 million legal tender was borrowed. The paper was purchased by Tang Qifang and delivered by Lu Guoshu and Yang Peisheng to Yan Bingshui for distribution. The printing plates were also delivered by Lu Guoshu to Yang Peisheng and then to Yan Bingshui for Ye Songmao. By the 16th and 17th of the same month, notes with a face value of 20 million had been printed and divided into four packages. Yang Peisheng and Yan Bingshui took them away successively and entrusted them to Lu Guoshu for safekeeping. Liu Jianqing and Han Fuyu took a portion (amount unknown) before the case occurred for use in Communist areas. After the case, Tang Qifang concealed the notes. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters uncovered the case based on a tip.</p>
<h3>Armory Fire Rekindles; Explosions Erupt Again at Night</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After a day and night of explosions, the Jiangwan Stadium armory had gradually become quiet by yesterday afternoon. However, around 8 PM last night, the fire rekindled, and a massive bomb exploded, causing renewed disaster. Around 10 PM, there was a brief lull, but at midnight, another explosion occurred, even more violent than in the evening. The continuous rumbling subsided gradually after 1 AM this morning. When the incident occurred again last night, the Jiangwan Police Station telephoned the fire brigade, which dispatched two fire trucks to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Defendants Claim Coerced Confessions to Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>During yesterday's court hearing, all five defendants, except for Tang Qifang, were shabbily dressed and cowering in the dock. Under questioning from the court, they denied their statements to the Garrison Headquarters, claiming they were coerced.</p>
<p>Yang Peisheng stated: "I am 30 years old, from Shandong, residing at 13 Songyin Lane, Xixi Road, Nanshi, working as a cigarette vendor. In July of this year, my friends Liu Jianqing and Han Fuyu came to Shanghai from Xuzhou, stating they wanted to print something for a friend and asked if I knew a printing shop. I introduced them to Yan Bingshui, and Liu and Han negotiated directly with him. I did not know beforehand that they were printing Anti-Currency."</p>
<h3>Yan Bingshui Testifies He Only Knew They Were Hell Money</h3>
<p>Yan Bingshui stated: "I am 33 years old, from Ningbo, working as a street peddler. In September of this year, Yang Peisheng told me that his friends wanted to print something and introduced me to Ye Songmao, the owner of the Ye Fansheng Printing Shop. I only led them there and they made the arrangements themselves. After the printing was completed, I saw that they were North Sea Bank notes and asked what they were. The person surnamed Liu replied that they were hell money. I asked why they didn't print Republic of China bank notes but North Sea Bank notes. Liu replied that it was a Shandong custom. I received a 10% commission as an intermediary. The agreed amount was 2 million, and I was paid 1 million upfront, but I only received 100,000."</p>
<h3>Printing Shop Owner Greedy for Business</h3>
<p>Ye Songmao stated: "I am 37 years old, from Ningbo, and have been running a printing shop for only four or five months. This business was introduced by Yan Bingshui. The person surnamed Liu came and told me it was okay to print. Later, Lu Guoshu brought four printing plates. I printed 50,000 notes of 200 yuan denomination and received a 1 million printing fee. Yan Bingshui and Yang Peisheng wanted a commission and also received 1 million. I have a small printing machine at home, but it was not good for printing. The larger printing machine was brought by Yan Bingshui and Yang Peisheng. When I accepted the job, I knew they were bank notes, but I had never seen this kind of note in Shanghai before. I was ignorant and greedy for business. I hope the court will be lenient."</p>
<h3>Lu Guoshu Burst into Tears Before Speaking</h3>
<p>Lu Guoshu burst into tears before speaking, sobbing uncontrollably. He trembled all over while answering questions. He was overly nervous and incoherent, repeatedly saying to the court, "Where was I? Please remind me." Summarizing his statement, he said, "I am 28 years old, from Kunshan, residing at 11 Hengqing Lane, Beile Road, working for the Dalu Trading Company. I met Yang Peisheng at the Great World Amusement Park. Yang said his friend wanted to borrow money to do business. I didn't have any money myself, so I discussed it with my middle school classmate, Tang Qifang. Tang lent 5 million, with a stated interest rate of 20%. I would earn 10%. I knew nothing about printing bank notes. Ye Songmao said things without any basis. The Garrison Headquarters arrested me. I am an honest person. I said that I did lend money for use as printing expenses, but I didn't know anything at all. Ye Songmao is being instructed to accuse me. I am not worried about myself, but I feel sorry for Mr. Tang, who lent 5 million and let me earn 10% interest, intending to help me, but now I have caused him to be involved in a lawsuit, which makes me very sad." He then burst into tears again.</p>
<h3>Tang Qifang Claims He Was Implicated by Lending Money</h3>
<p>Tang Qifang stated, "I am 25 years old, from Shanghai, residing at 270 Dongtai Road. Lu Guoshu said his friend was doing solo business and needed funds, so he asked me to lend money. I don't know Yang Peisheng or the others at all. I have been detained for over 80 days due to being implicated. I request to be released on bail."</p>
<p>The debate then began. The defense lawyers hired by Lu and Tang, in addition to arguing the facts, challenged the prosecutor's application of Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Statute on Punishment for Obstructing National Currency, which was considered inappropriate. The main legal basis cited in the indictment was counterfeiting bank notes. According to the case, the defendants were undoubtedly guilty of "counterfeiting," but the crux of the matter lies in the interpretation of the term "bank notes." The establishment of the "North Sea Bank" was not approved by the central government according to law. Therefore, whether the "North Sea Bank" qualifies as a bank under the law is a question worthy of study. Ye, Yang, and Ye did not have money to hire lawyers, and they were defended by court-appointed defenders who argued that the bank notes printed by the defendants were indeed counterfeit and had no backing. At this point, the debate concluded, and the court scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 14th. The five defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Innocent Merchants Returned from Burma; No Specific Arrangements for Repatriation; Thinly Clothed and Pitiable Condition</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the British repatriation of over 200 so-called "disorderly soldiers" from Burma, after the Garrison Headquarters determined that most were innocent merchants, the Ministry of National Defense issued a telegram ordering that the weak and infirm be sent back to their hometowns and the able-bodied be drafted into military service. Yu Jianxian, Deputy Director of the Second Department of the Military Service Bureau, was dispatched to Shanghai to handle the matter. After arriving in Shanghai, Yu contacted the Garrison Headquarters last weekend. However, as of yesterday, no concrete steps had been taken. These innocent merchants are still detained in the Garrison Headquarters detention center, mostly thinly clothed. In this cold weather, the Garrison Headquarters has no prison uniforms and cannot issue military uniforms. It can only provide cotton blankets to keep them warm, which is extremely pitiful. It is also reported that many have families back in their hometowns and requested to be exempted from military service and repatriated. Yesterday, ten merchants from the Yunnan border jointly submitted a petition, which the authorities are considering.</p>
<h3>How Much Trash Do You Produce Each Day? Health Bureau Director Says 1.2 Pounds</h3>
<p>[Our Special] Readers, how much trash did you produce yesterday?</p>
<p>Don't find my question abrupt. My question is based on information. According to the Health Bureau's announcement yesterday, "The city's population has exceeded four million, with each person producing 1.2 pounds of trash per day."</p>
<p>The entire city of Shanghai "produces" 2,400 tons of trash daily. 1,400 tons are transported by barge to Sanlintang, and the remaining 1,000 tons are transported by trucks, horse-drawn carts, collapsing carts, and handcarts to the suburbs to fill depressions and ditches.</p>
<p>There are currently 3,257 sanitation workers. Director Zhang said, "Before the war, there was one sanitation worker for every 450 residents in the Public Concession. Now, there is only one sanitation worker for every 1,100 residents."</p>
<p>Director Zhang also talked about "sanitation policies." He said, "The sanitation policy of the concession era prioritized operations first and money second. The sanitation policy of the enemy and puppet regime was to sweep without transporting, piling up garbage on the roadside like mountains."</p>
<p>What is Director Zhang's sanitation policy? It is "economy first, work second." Below is Director Zhang's statistics: Sanitation workers sweep 2.2 city miles of road per day, 66 miles per month, averaging a remuneration of 1,383 yuan per mile.</p>
<p>Garbage workers haul 1.5 tons of trash per day, 45 tons per month, averaging a remuneration of 2,186.50 yuan per ton.</p>
<p>How can work efficiency be improved and promote the city's cleanliness?</p>
<p>Director Zhang's report says, "To make the horse run diligently, it is necessary to feed the horse grass."</p>

<h3>Health Bureau Hosts Press Conference, Promotes Importance of National Health; 30,000 Children Examined, Only One-Tenth Healthy; Over One Hundred Doctors Willing to Provide Free Treatment</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon, at 4:00 PM, the Health Bureau hosted a press conference for reporters in the Municipal Government’s bureau conference room. Director Zhang Wei of the bureau reported on the importance of national health. The slogan of powerful countries in Europe and America is currently, "Health first, children first." They are making every effort to research eugenics. If our country does not catch up quickly, the future is unimaginable. Therefore, representatives of the recent National Health Administration Conference, namely Chen Wanli, Director of the Health Department of Jiangsu Province, Xu Shilun, Director of the Health Department of Zhejiang Province, Wang Zuxiang, Director of the Health Bureau of Nanjing, and Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Bureau of Shanghai, jointly submitted a letter to the National Assembly, suggesting that when discussing the constitution, a clause guaranteeing the "People's Right to Health" be added to the chapter on the rights and obligations of the people to establish a foundation of prosperity and well-being for the hundreds of millions of people in China. They also requested that the National Assembly representatives in various regions take on the responsibility of promoting this to the people to make the people understand the importance of national health for the country.</p>
<p>Chen Bangxian, Director of the Epidemic Prevention Department, reported on the recent work of the department, saying that winter is a quiet period for epidemics. The main work is to strengthen organization and formulate guidelines to prepare for the future. To prevent the spread of diseases, the epidemic prevention tax attached to the house tax is used to purchase a large number of trash cans, 335 of which have been manufactured. These are being rushed into production. In addition, the Public Works Bureau has been asked to add free water faucets and increase artesian wells to minimize infectious diseases next year.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Director of the Health Care Department of the Bureau reported on the progress of the Health Promotion Competition, stating that as of now, 69,570 people have registered, including 48,749 children and 20,821 young people. However, there is a particularly small participation rate from infants and toddlers. The Health Bureau believes that the health competition is mainly for infants. Therefore, it was decided to extend the registration deadline for infants and toddlers to the end of December, hoping that the fathers and mothers in this city will automatically go to participate.</p>
<p>Up to yesterday, 33,971 people had undergone initial examinations for the health competition. The examination results showed that only 11% were healthy and flawless. Among them, tonsillitis accounted for 22%, trachoma accounted for 51%, dental diseases accounted for 32%, skin diseases accounted for 6%, phimosis accounted for 13%, and malnutrition accounted for 20%. Anyone suffering from the above defects can receive free treatment from the Health Bureau. The bureau is contacting various doctors for assistance. It is reported that 151 dentists are willing to set aside half a day each week to provide free dental treatment for participants. In addition, trachoma, skin diseases, etc., will be actively treated next spring. Tonsillectomies are expected to be performed free of charge next spring. The bureau has also purchased a large number of cod liver oil and milk powder, which will be distributed to those suffering from malnutrition.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Five Years Dedicated to Popular Education: Dr. Y.C. James Yen's Touching and Profound Account of Smooth Progress, Every Word Filled with Concern for the People</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] "For many years, our country has advocated literacy campaigns, agricultural revitalization, and the promotion of democratic politics. But what has been achieved so far? Whether it is our government or we as individuals, we have made a big mistake – that mistake is that we have not paid attention to the grassroots. As a result, although there are many proposals, the people who advocate them have only formed many small cliques and have not engaged with the broad masses of the people. The common people are still living a primitive life!"</p>
<p>Dr. Y.C. James Yen could not help but feel emotional when talking about this trend of "neglecting the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial." Although there were already many silver strands in Mr. Yen's hair, his passion made him look eternally young. He spoke smoothly about the progress of popular education, his voice clear and calm, every word filled with concern for the people. Hearing his sincere teachings, I was deeply moved.</p>
<p>Achieving Broad Results Through Appropriate Methods</p>
<p>Mr. Yen said, "I have been engaged in popular education for twenty-five years. I deeply feel that the most important thing for those of us engaged in popular education is to discover various feasible methods, and then teach these methods to the common people. Implementation requires the broad masses of the people to take action themselves. The common people are not unwilling to accept new methods, but these new methods must meet three conditions: first, they must be simple, otherwise they will not be easily understood; second, they must be practical, otherwise they will not listen to you; and third, they must be economical and save money, so that they are happy to give it a try.</p>
<p>Many things require knowledge, not money. For example, when we first went to Ding County, smallpox and neonatal tetanus were very prevalent. We treated them and told them about hygiene, and soon achieved results. The so-called neonatal tetanus is because local midwives did not understand hygiene and used unclean scissors to cut the umbilical cord of infants. Naturally, the infants were susceptible to disease, often suffering from spasms around the fourth or sixth day after birth, eventually leading to death. After we arrived, we found many young women in Ding County, taught them midwifery knowledge, and had them tell all the women in the county that when giving birth, they must first boil the scissors in water before using them. After three years, there were no more cases of neonatal tetanus in Ding County. No one died from smallpox either. So, we can know that when we go to the people, we don't have to do everything ourselves, but we have to tell them various appropriate methods and let them do it themselves. Only in this way can we mobilize many people and achieve broad results."</p>
<p>Arousing the Interest of the Common People: Ensuring They Have Food</p>
<p>How can we promote popular education now? Mr. Yen said, "The country is currently unstable, and it is impossible to do it on a large scale. But now is a good time to conserve energy, organize teaching materials, and collect teaching aids, so that everything is ready when it is needed. When large-scale implementation is carried out in the future, we plan to divide the country into several regions, conduct demonstrations in several central locations, and train supervisors and teachers, and then gradually promote it. It doesn't take long, four or five years will be able to make significant progress."</p>
<p>How can we arouse the interest of the common people in learning? Mr. Yen said, "Can we use movies and dramas to stimulate them? Mr. Xiong Fuxi, Mr. Yang Cunbin, Mr. Zhao Yuanren, and Mr. Sun Fuguo have all contributed a lot in this area." "We not only want to teach them to read, but most importantly, we want to teach them to have food to eat. When they are not full, you can teach them anything and they will not be interested. So, when we first arrived in Ding County, we first taught them how to improve farming methods. Ding County produces cotton. When we first arrived, they could only do 120,000 yuan of business each year, but after a few years, it jumped to 1.5 million - this was before the war, and 1.5 million was a considerable amount. But later we found that this was not enough, and the common people still needed economic organization. So, we taught them to form many cooperatives, so that they could organize themselves in transportation, sales, and purchasing. The exploitation of middlemen was gone, and the common people got real benefits."</p>
<p>Recalling the Past by the Hearth: The Success of the Ding County Experiment</p>
<p>Mr. Yen said excitedly, "They first improved production, and then they had an economic organization. Then we tried our best to promote healthcare, and the common people naturally demanded autonomy. They can't ignore their own affairs, and no one can stop them from managing their own affairs. The ultimate goal of popular education is popular politics - and 'popular politics' is 'democracy'!"</p>
<p>Because the Ding County experiment was successful, popular education centers and health centers were also established throughout China. Also because Mr. Yen and his colleagues emphasized the importance of the "county," this basic administrative organization also received widespread attention, and the "New County System" and "Experimental County" were born.</p>
<p>Mr. Yen said, "Back then, students from Tsinghua, Yenching, Peking Union Medical College, and Jinling University often came to Ding County for internships. Those studying politics went to work in the county government, and those studying agriculture joined the farm. This was the beginning of 'internships' for Chinese university students before graduation."</p>
<p>The fire in the guest room was burning brightly, and Mr. Yen thought of Ding County amidst the shadow of the chrysanthemum. "In September 1937, we were driven out of Ding County. But although we left, our methods remained in Ding County. During the war, an American reader visited many guerrilla areas and said: The most tightly organized and the most heroic in resisting Japan was the Ding County guerrilla!"</p>

Recently, rumors have circulated that the investigators are indignant that Division Chief He Ge privately used attendance fees for interest payments, and will petition Mayor Wu and the Municipal Council. In response, the reporter inquired with Deputy Director Hu Wenyuan of the Bureau. Deputy Director Hu solemnly stated that this matter is absolutely untrue. Hu said that the Bureau directly issues receipts for all salary expenditures through the Accounting Office, and has never entrusted any person in charge with the distribution of funds. The payment of salaries and allowances for the investigators is subject to audit.</p>

<h3>First Meeting on Salvaging Sunken Ships: Initial Capital Set at 200 Million Yuan, Salvage Equipment to be Leased from UNRRA</h3>

<h3>Businessmen Request Improvement of Salary System</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] More than 400 businessmen from the city's hotel industry association have reported that the market has been sluggish for the past three months, with business plummeting. Since the implementation of the employee salary system a year ago, the industry has suffered heavy losses. Although the industry has negotiated with the labor side three times, all have failed. So far, the industry has become a situation of opening for one day and losing money for one day. Water, electricity, and rent are set aside. The most serious thing is still the salaries of the employees. If it is not resolved quickly, the industry will be forced to close down. It is reported that in addition to continuing to submit this urgent situation to the relevant authorities for review, the industry has also revealed the industry's proposed plan to improve the current salary system. The content includes two points: (1) Change the current salary system to a flexible salary split system. (2) Adjust the number of tea attendants and revise the dismissal method to correct the past problem of excessive manpower and seek a balance of income and expenditure.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The labor side of the city's confectionery industry requested an adjustment of wages. Although this matter has been negotiated repeatedly, the opinions of the two sides are far apart, and no agreement has been reached. It is now scheduled that the labor and management sides will negotiate again at the Social Affairs Bureau today. In addition, the Tianzun Silk Factory No. 2 stopped production on the 12th of last month due to poor business, and 17 workers were transferred to Factory No. 3. Now Factory No. 2 has been sold and the ownership has been changed, renamed Meicheng Silk Factory. These workers are now requesting to return to work at Meicheng. The management did not agree, and a dispute arose. It is currently being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau. In addition, the Fumin Eye Medicine Factory closed down on the 16th of last month, leaving 23 workers unemployed. At that time, it was stated that severance pay would be issued for three months. However, the management suddenly went back on its word, and the workers have now jointly requested mediation from the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Three Traitors Rescheduled for Retrial</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Portuguese citizen Nakamura Remidis (i.e., Joe Remidis), Xue Fa'er, and Hungarian citizen Xibao Ke successively purchased 150 tons of gasoline for the Japanese Nakamura Taniyoshi during the Shanghai occupation. After being reported, they were arrested by the Songhu Garrison Command and sent to the High Court for trial. On April 24 this year, Remidis was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and eight years of deprivation of civil rights, Xue Fa'er was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights, and Xibao Ke was sentenced to four years of imprisonment and four years of deprivation of civil rights. The defendants refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court. After the Supreme Court sent it back for retrial, the High Court opened a retrial yesterday morning.

It was also heard that Gan's request for bail for medical treatment had been rejected and he was sent to the prison hospital for treatment nearby.

<h3>Reader Consultation, Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Marrying Two Women</p>
<p>Chen Dahao asks: My father's surname was Zhang, and he passed away long ago. There are three siblings. I am the eldest. I was adopted into my mother's family as a grandson at the age of five. I married nine years ago and have no children. My sister also married a long time ago. Unexpectedly, my younger brother died three years ago without starting a family, resulting in no one to inherit the family name. Therefore, for the sake of the Zhang family, I want to marry another wife as an heir to the Zhang family. I don't know if this would be considered bigamy under the law, and whether my wife has the right to interfere. Can I marry the second wife openly? After marrying two women, will there be a distinction between wife and concubine? I hope you can answer the above points.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin answers] The law clearly stipulates penalties for those who are already married and remarry, as well as those who cohabit in marriage. If it is for the sake of the Zhang family's descendants, you can marry a woman and cohabit, but there should be no marriage ceremony, which is the ancient custom of a concubine or side room. The children born will be the same as legitimate children.</p>
<p>(2) Inheritance After Marriage</p>
<p>Shen Zhiliang asks: A has four sisters. The first two sisters married in the 24th and 26th years, respectively. The third and fourth sisters are still at home. A's father passed away last year (34th year). I would like to ask the following questions. Please answer them for me. (1) Can the married first two sisters demand to share the property? (2) I heard that daughters who married while their father was alive have no right to demand to share the property. Is this true? (3) Can the unmarried third and fourth sisters have the right to inherit property? If so, what is the ratio with A? (4) Is the right to demand inheritance of property permanent, or is there a time limit?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Chuan Shenlin answers] (1) They have the same right to inherit the estate. (2) Same as the answer to question 1. (3) The number of shares to be inherited should be divided equally according to the number of people. (4) It expires ten years after the date of death of the inherited person.</p>

<h3>The Key to Eliminating Black Market for Cotton Yarn Lies in Private Spinning Mills. Manufacturers Unsatisfied with Control Measures, Set Up Subcommittee to Draft New Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding how to regulate the yarn and cloth market and reduce the black market, a draft plan was formed at the weekly meeting of the Cotton Spinning Control Committee last Thursday based on the opinions of the participating members. It is now reported that when the case was submitted to President Song for approval yesterday, President Song reviewed it once. However, in the end, it was felt that private factories often failed to thoroughly implement the plans previously drafted by the Cotton Spinning Control Committee. In order to implement the entire yarn and cloth strategy, the government has decided to find ways to provide as much foreign exchange as possible for the cotton required for purchases. However, in reality, the private factories must draft an implementable plan and submit it to President Song for approval before it can be implemented. President Song's intention was conveyed by Wu Qian, the Chairman of the Cotton Spinning Control Committee, to Wang Qiyu, the Chairman of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association.</p>
<p>The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association convened an extraordinary meeting of members at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Seventy or eighty representatives from various member factories attended, chaired by Wang Qiyu. Wang said that the government had decided to provide as much raw cotton as possible. The factories should properly understand the government's intentions regarding the disposal of the cotton yarn they produce and should not dispose of it too freely. Wang proposed four points: (1) Restore free trade. (2) Restore the spinning building listing system. (3) Set standard prices for yarns of various counts. (4) For the US cotton required by each factory, adopt the method of exchanging yarn for cotton, with the principle of one bag of yarn for one bag of cotton. However, the representatives present did not agree with the points raised by Wang. Some representatives believed that the current cotton yarn control measures agreed upon by the Cotton Spinning Control Committee were too restrictive. At the same time, they also believed that the purchase of foreign cotton should be opened up, allowing each yarn factory to purchase freely. The cotton yarn produced should also be freely transported and sold by each yarn factory. If there are exports, the resulting foreign exchange can be sold to the government as compensation.</p>
<p>In the end, it was decided that under the principle of free trade, the economic future of the country should be taken into account, the principle of suppressing yarn prices, and the legal profits and business development of the yarn factories should be protected. A proper plan was drafted, and Tang Xinghai, Guo Qiong, Rong Yixin, Liu Jingji, Lu Zidong, Xi Yushu, and nine others were elected to form a subcommittee to draft the entire plan. The subcommittee is scheduled to meet at 10:00 AM today.</p>

There were not many Hong Kong dollar chips, and the situation was stable. As a result, it rose by 20 yuan compared with last Saturday. The Hong Kong exchange rate remained between 990 yuan and 1,000 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 1,190 to 1,210 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 15,900 yuan to 16,000 yuan.

The momentum was unable to recover. Northern Japonica rice was slightly weaker. Southern Japonica rice softened in the middle. Indica rice was still firm due to the scarcity of goods. White Yin Yuan was also mediocre. For the time being, there was little change in various goods. Soybean appetite in the local market turned positive, rebounding by 300 to 1,000 yuan.

Broad beans were more smoothly retailed in the local market, rising by 1,000 yuan. The appetite for corn from Qingdao was very strong, but there was a lack of both arrivals and inventory in the Shanghai area. There were no goods on the market, and the situation was moving towards a peak.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market was neither good nor bad. The sales of 20-count yarn were mediocre. Those holding the goods were eager to sell, so they continued to slightly lower the price by 10,000 to 20,000. 32-count fine yarn was absorbed by Anhui merchants, and the price was quite good. The fabric factories' woven products remained sluggish as before, resulting in a sluggish and weak market for 42-count yarn.</p>
<h3>Protecting the Seasoning Powder Industry, Seasoning Powder is Prohibited from Import</h3>
<p>The city's Seasoning Powder Industry Association stated that the production of the original domestic seasoning powder manufacturing plants is sufficient to supply consumption throughout the country. Before the war and in the early days of the War of Resistance, it still had the capacity to expand its market in the Nanyang Islands. However, recently, due to the impact of the continuous import of foreign goods, business has declined sharply, and factories have been forced to reduce production. If this continues, the entire seasoning powder industry is in danger of bankruptcy. They have stated their reasons to the Temporary Import Management Committee, requesting that seasoning powder be prohibited from import. It is now known that the association has received a reply approving the prohibition of imports.</p>

The allocation will be coordinated and distributed by the Coal Industry Joint Distribution Office. It is reported that the allocated coal can be shipped this week.

<p>(3) Minimum trading unit: Tentatively set at 50,000 shares</p>
<p>(4) Pricing unit: Set at one dime.</p>
<p>(5) Pricing method: The difference between the spot price and the deferred delivery price is quoted, such as 8 yuan and 1 dime, 9 yuan and 3 dimes, etc.</p>

<h3>Repeated Shortage of Allotted Yarn Creates Difficulties During Re-allocation by the Secondary Distribution Committee</h3>
<p>The Secondary Product Industry Yarn Allocation Committee, for the second allocation of yarn in the fourth period, yesterday (the 9th) verified the allocation to the nine public associations under its jurisdiction based on the forms submitted by the Cotton Textile Association. These associations will distribute the yarn to their respective member factories in the next two days. According to sources at the Secondary Distribution Committee, the yarn received this period totaled 4,760 bales, which, according to the new ratio, is equivalent to 5,741.61 bales of 20-count standard yarn. This is a shortage of over 250 bales compared to the quota of 6,000 bales. If calculated according to the original ratio, the shortage would be even greater. There was also a shortage of over 200 bales of yarn in the previous period. The Cotton Textile Industry Yarn Allocation Committee resolved to seek additional yarn at its meeting last week, but this has not been resolved. Moreover, over a thousand bales of 10-count yarn have been returned over time, and repeated requests have been made to the Textile Control Committee to allocate 20-count common yarn to meet practical needs and cover the shortage, but there has been no response. The cotton industry generally believes that there is no need to allocate additional yarn because the returned yarn includes common yarn. However, the Secondary Distribution Committee argues that the return of suitable cotton yarn is only due to the individual actions of a very small number of members who lack sufficient funds, and does not mean that there is a surplus in the total amount. They are still requesting additional allocation. It is unknown how the Textile Control Committee will handle this. The actual yarn allocated to member factories of various industries this time will be even less than in the previous period. The factories are quite critical of their respective public associations, and the persons in charge of the public associations feel even more troubled. Among them, it is difficult to cope with the 20-count and 42-count double-ply common yarn. According to Fan Shihao, the person in charge of the Secondary Distribution Committee, since the conversion ratio of yarn counts was changed to the new standard, the finer counts have almost uniformly been reduced to 90% of the previous several allocations. The total shortage for two consecutive periods is over 200 bales each, and the return of 10-count yarn has not been resolved for a long time. The difficult situation of the various public associations deserves attention. They are compiling statistics and presenting reasons to the Textile Control Committee to request an increase in the allocation quota to address the urgent need.</p>
<h3>Five Types of Public Bonds, Including the "Relief" Bond, to Be Redeemed by Lottery Today</h3>

<h3>Two Major Threats to the Match Industry: Too Many Smuggled Goods and Excessively High Taxes; Recent Plans to Open Up Sales Market in South China</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The matches produced in this city are mainly supplied to this city and the Beijing-Shanghai area. The main market for export has been North China. However, there are recent plans to expand the market in South China, although the specific quantity has not yet been determined. According to relevant sources, the production volume of matches in this city has not increased significantly compared to two or three months ago. There are two major threats to the match industry in our country at present: (1) There are many smuggled goods, and the customs' crackdown is not very effective. The Ministry of Finance now attaches great importance to this matter and has instructed the Goods Tax Bureau to inform the Match Industry Association to collect smuggling information and report it in detail for reference. (2) The tax burden is too heavy. For example, in terms of goods tax, the tax rate for cotton yarn is less than 10%, while the tax rate for matches is 20%. This is because the financial authorities regard cotton yarn as a necessity, while matches are considered to be mostly used for lighting cigarettes and are classified as luxury goods. Moreover, the income and profit tax allocated in the 34th year (1945) was as high as 150 million yuan, but according to people in the industry, the actual profit was less than 100 million yuan. Based on this calculation, the tax rate is as high as 150% or more! Therefore, the match industry is currently brewing a petition to reduce taxes, which may be successful soon. As for the match industry as a whole, the situation of large factories is still good, and a large match factory in this city plans to purchase the enemy-puppet match factory in Qingdao with huge funds. However, it is difficult for small factories to maintain operations, and they regard the end of the year as a difficult hurdle to overcome.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Tea Market Transactions</h3>
<p>In the foreign merchant tea market, British export firms still demanded high-grade aged Keemun yesterday. Unfortunately, goods were scarce and supply was limited, creating a stalemate. Transactions were few and far between. Prices, however, remained stable. Although American merchants also watched the standard first grade "Ta Ruo Wu Se Ping Shui Xin Da Bang," their prices were not at all flexible. Exports have been quiet for a long time. The Tea Merchants Association of this city once telegraphed overseas requesting higher prices, but the results were like a stone sinking into the sea, with no news. Based on the current situation, the sale of Chinese tea to the United States is unlikely to expand in the short term. As for green teas such as "Chou Zhen" and "Zhen Mei" sold to Morocco and other places in Africa, it is still not easy to sell low-grade goods. Due to the disparity in domestic and foreign prices for high-quality goods and the lack of ships, the situation has also been very sluggish recently. Domestic sales of various green teas have not yet recovered. Looking at the trend, it seems to be precarious.</p>
<h3>Approved Amount of Yarn and Cloth to Be Shipped to the South</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The amount of yarn and cloth approved by the Textile Control Committee to be shipped to the South this month is 2,967 bales of yarn and 75,647 bolts of cloth. Including the remaining amount from the previous month's applications, which is 834 bales of yarn and 8,586 bolts of cloth, the total amount to be shipped this month is 3,801 bales of yarn and 84,233 bolts of cloth. The notification letters to the manufacturers can be sent out today. After receiving them, they can start applying.</p>
<h3>Cotton Inventory Registration Completed</h3>
<p>The registration of cotton inventory by the Textile Control Committee, which began last week, has been completed by various silk factories, cotton trading houses, and foreign firms. The authorities are determining the total amount of raw cotton needed by the yarn factories in the future. Bei Zuyi, the President of the Central Bank, and Shu Yunjhang, among others, visited President Song this morning around 10:00 AM to report on the progress of the cotton inventory registration and to discuss important matters regarding the opening of U.S. dollar foreign exchange to solve the raw cotton problem. The meeting lasted for quite some time. Furthermore, Mr. Song was also very concerned about the sharp rise in gold prices and inquired in detail of Mr. Bei about the recent situation of curbing gold prices.</p>
<p>Another report: The Cotton Industry Association submitted the registered cotton inventory of the cotton trading houses in this city to the Textile Control Committee for review on the morning of the 9th. According to the statistics of this cotton inventory registration, there are 100,000 *zu* of spot cotton, 11,000 *zu* of standard cotton, and over 300,000 *dan* of contracted cotton, of which 11,000 *dan* of standard cotton will arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Wool Textile Industry Petition in Beijing, Requesting Amendment of the Goods Tax</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Cheng Chepeng, the chairman of the Shanghai Wool, Velvet, Textile, Dyeing Industry Association, along with directors Tang Junyuan, Ge Jiecun, Tang Yeru, Ye Fukan, Wu Shangeng, and secretary Yang Liren, a group of seven people, took the night express train to Beijing last night, representing the industry to petition the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Taxation Department on two points: (1) The goods tax levied on the industry was originally aimed at woolen fabrics, but now it is proposed to change it to woolen yarn. (2) The goods tax rate for woolen yarn is as high as 15%, while the rate for cotton yarn is only 5%. Both belong to clothing raw materials, so it is proposed that the tax rates should be treated equally. It is reported that the representatives will stay in Beijing for two or three days.</p>
<h3>Large Shipment of Foreign Paper Arrives</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The "Deike" freighter, managed by the Tianxiang Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai at noon the day before yesterday, carrying 1,700 tons of foreign paper from the United States, and 2,270 bales of cotton from Hong Kong. It berthed at the Longmao Warehouse for unloading.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Recession Leads to Sluggish Stock Market</h3>
<p>The Shanghai stock market experienced widespread pessimism yesterday, with unfavorable conditions. Due to a lack of interest in holding onto stocks, transactions were scarce, and prices were more likely to fall than rise. At the opening, various stocks showed slight declines. After the opening, the scene was bleak. Stocks such as 70, 198, 186, 207, and 36 were sold off, as demand far exceeded supply. Prices gradually decreased. After 10:15, some financial institutions, such as 110 and 47, engaged in arbitrage when prices were low, which stabilized the market slightly. However, stock 186 heavily sold Mei Ya and Yong Yarn, and stock 89 pressured the market with short selling. Although stocks 215 and 211 occasionally bought aggressively, the overall trend could not be reversed. Later, stock 157 sold China Silk to the limit down, and stock 148 also forced Mei Ya to the limit down, making the market even more fearful. After 11:30, stocks 35 and 196 sold spot Yong Yarn, and stocks 186, 151, 89, and 207 sold forward Yong Yarn. The market looked the most fatigued at the close. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yong Yarn, Mei Ya, Xin He, Jing Fu, Xin Guang, and Qin Xing fell by about 10%, Hua Feng fell by 5%, the cold stock Datong rose slightly, Zhong Fang fell slightly, China Silk fell to the limit down, Wu He remained flat, and the rest fell by 5% to 10%. Forward Mei Ya and Xin He fell by more than 10%, Yong Yarn, Jing Fu, and Xin Guang fell by 10%, and Qin Xing and Hua Feng fell by 5%. In the afternoon, continuing the trend from the morning, the market became even more sluggish. Mei Ya first fell to the limit down. Yong Yarn once broke the 400 yuan mark. After falling to a low, it was slightly supplemented by stock 70 and others, and the market hovered and stabilized. At the close, because the cold stocks gradually showed signs of strength, they were driven up. Tong Yi rose by 50 yuan at the close, which was the most eye-catching. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yong Yarn and Jing Fu fell by slightly less than 10%, Hua Feng fell by 5%, Mei Ya, Xin He, and Xin Guang each fell by slightly more than 10%, the cold stock Tong Yi alone rose by 10%, Datong rose slightly, Zhong Fang fell slightly, China Silk fell to the limit down in the morning, and the rest fell by 5% to 10%. Forward Yong Yarn, Xin He, Jing Fu, and Xin Guang each fell by 10%, Mei Ya fell by 15%, and Dong Xing and Hua Feng fell by 5%. Over-the-counter stocks fell again.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were even more dismal yesterday. Under the circumstance that no one paid attention, they reported a complete collapse again. Except for small stocks, the decline was more severe. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Paper Industry, Navigation, and Ewo Brewery fell slightly, Jardine Matheson and Wheelock Marden fell by 5%, and Ewo Cotton Mill and British-American Tobacco each fell by about 10%.</p>
<h3>The Gap Between the Official Exchange Rate and the Black Market is Too Large; Remittances From Overseas Chinese are Evaded by Tens of Thousands of People; Bank of China is Actively Trying to Prevent This</h3>
<p>Remittances from overseas Chinese are related to the balance of international payments. The Bank of China has made its best efforts to assist and facilitate them. However, the situation of remittances from overseas Chinese has not improved. In recent months, they have been declining. Although there was a slight improvement in August due to the relaxation of foreign exchange controls, they declined again in October. There are no statistics for November, but the Bank of China's income from remittances from overseas Chinese is not as high as in October. The situation is still continuously deteriorating, and the situation is extremely serious. According to investigations by relevant parties, the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese evaded between Hong Kong and Guangzhou reaches 10 million U.S. dollars per month. The amount is so huge that it is shocking. According to the report of the Bank of China, before February of this year, the income from remittances from overseas Chinese was 5 million U.S. dollars per month. After the opening of foreign exchange in March, it gradually decreased. Now it is only 2 million U.S. dollars, a difference of three-fifths, which has become an extremely serious problem at present. It is learned that, regarding the reasons for the evasion of remittances from overseas Chinese, the Bank of China's research concluded that it is nothing more than</p>
<p>(1) The speed of remittances. However, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other places can directly remit money abroad. Remittances from New York can arrive in two days at most. It only takes two or three hours from Guangzhou to Siyi. Postal remittances can arrive in two weeks or ten days at most. Telegraphic transfers and postal remittances have all returned to the pre-war state, so this problem is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>(2) The exchange rate problem. The official exchange rate set by the government is 3,350, while the black market rate has risen to around 5,000. The official rate is too low, and the black market is too high. This is the biggest factor in the evasion of remittances from overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The methods of evasion are based on two types of remittances, USD checks and HKD checks. The former, USD checks, were originally intended for transfers from town A to town B in the US. These checks, which are good only for payment when transferred from San Francisco to New York, are now circulated in Guangzhou. The locals call it "Tongtian Dipaper", and openly trade it. Besides merchants, wealthy families are also buying the USD checks. Merchants are able to use the checks to make payments in USD back in the U.S. The merchants are importing private goods, and the imports cannot be settled through official foreign exchange procedures. The merchants buy the USD checks to settle the imports. The cost is lower than the free-market USD exchange rate. If the free-market USD exchange rate is 5,000 yuan, the merchants can purchase USD checks at 4,000 yuan. Therefore, the merchants use USD checks instead of official foreign exchange procedures. The wealthy families buy the USD checks and deposit the funds in the U.S., which helps to keep "Tongtian Dipaper" circulating. The latter, HKD checks, can be used to obtain cash in Hong Kong, since there is still a gap between the official and free-market HKD exchange rates. If the people don't go to Hong Kong to obtain cash, they can still trade HKD checks in Guangzhou. Therefore, the evasion of remittances from overseas Chinese is closely related to smuggling. The Bank of China is aware of this and is actively trying to rescue the situation. It is preparing prevention measures against the evasion of remittances from overseas Chinese, based on the current situation. Regarding the HKD check problem, the Bank of China and the Central Bank have agreed to set a new official exchange rate for purchasing HKD based on the free-market HKD exchange rate in Guangzhou. The "Tongtian Dipaper" issue is still being studied.</p>

At 10:00 AM, the First Division will feature the match between the Jewish team and Yau Yau. The Jewish team's recent performance has been poor, so they may have difficulty defeating Yau Yau.

<h3>Hong Kong Boxing King Jiang Haoquan, Renowned in Chongqing, to Have Boxing Match</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After a period of enthusiasm, boxing competitions have recently subsided with the cold winds. During the amateur and professional bouts between the Chung Ching and Jewish teams, few noticed that a renowned boxing king was watching from the sidelines. This observer was none other than Hong Kong's boxing king Jiang Haoquan, who is renowned in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang is 27 years old, a native of Changzhou, Jiangsu Province. He is 1.75 meters tall and weighs 160 pounds. His physique is extremely well-developed, with well-developed pectoral muscles, shoulder muscles, deltoid muscles, and biceps. He has defeated British professional boxer Elmbert, amateur boxing tiger Tai Mi Imanse, Qiu Huigensen, and American Springfield University boxing champion White Keqin, among others. Mr. Jiang is not only good at Western boxing, but he has also defeated several veterans in wrestling. He is also a good tap dancer, and he won the diving competition at the Guilin Swimming Competition on his way from Hong Kong to Chongqing. Today, our reporter visited Mr. Jiang on Baoshan Road. Mr. Jiang said the following:</p>
<p>Besides muscle relaxation and proper application, the most important things in Western boxing are punch power and the agility of dodging. British and American people are good at punch power, while Chinese boxers are good at dodging. When I box with foreigners, I often win, which is an important reason for this. Therefore, it is not difficult for Chinese people to learn Western boxing. With a little hard work, they can easily defeat British and American boxers.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, various Chinese and foreign professionals have asked me to participate, saying that I can earn more than two million yuan per match, but I am preparing to participate in the 1948 Olympic Games, so I cannot sacrifice my life's future for this small amount of income.</p>
<p>I am still practicing hard every day. Because I have no opponent, I have to imagine an enemy and fight ten rounds. This is certainly very frustrating, but I cannot give up now! I would like to organize an amateur championship before New Year's Day. Various Chinese and foreign amateur boxing friends have agreed to sponsor it, and I hope that it can become a reality. However, the venue problem has not yet been solved. I have discussed it with the Municipal Gymnasium, but they want to charge 40% of the income as rent, which is a very large expense.</p>
<p>After the interview, the reporter left, thinking silently on the way back: Domestic facilities, nutrition, physical strength, and the atmosphere of Western boxing are far inferior to those in other countries. We should place great hope on this very promising boxer, hoping that China can also show its strength in one event at the 1948 Olympic Games.</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Briefs</p>
<h3>Delineation Issue Between Suzhou and Shanghai: Internal Provincial and Municipal Government Officials Conduct Joint Survey; People Line Up to Welcome and Wish to Be Governed by the Municipality</h3>
<p>The issue of the boundary delineation between this municipality and Jiangsu Province has been pending for twenty years without resolution. In order to expedite the delineation for better management, the Ministry of Interior sent Inspector Cheng to come to Shanghai to conduct a joint survey. The Municipal Government sent Li Xuexun, Zhou Qizhong of the Civil Affairs Department, Xu Hongkui of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhang, Wu Ruzhi of the Public Works Bureau, Zhong Yaohua and Li Zhigang of the Urban Planning Committee, etc. The Jiangsu Provincial Government sent Hui Jin and Gong Jin, two officials, to conduct a joint survey of the delineation sites.</p>
<p>On the first of this month, they first went to Qisai Town. Upon arrival, more than a thousand representatives petitioning for the delineation had already gathered at the station to welcome them, unanimously chanting slogans expressing their wish to be governed by the municipality. After disembarking, Inspector Cheng met with the petitioning representatives to solicit their opinions and, together with the Baoshan County government, conducted an on-site inspection. The next day, they went to Minhang, where the Shanghai County government convened local gentry and the heads of the County Party Department and the County Council in the reception room to hold a discussion and exchange opinions. On the 3rd, they conducted a joint survey of Zhuanqiao Town. Upon arrival, they, together with County Magistrate Xu and Secretary Li of Jiading, inspected the Juejie area, and Inspector Cheng met with the petitioning representatives to solicit their opinions. Most representatives advocated for incorporation into the municipal area for the convenience of promoting autonomous construction and governance. On the morning of the 4th, they traveled by car to Xingzhuang and, after talking with the County Magistrate of Songjiang and the Chief of the Urban Police Station, Inspector Cheng gave a speech to more than a thousand representatives present and solicited the opinions of the petitioning representatives. All representatives insisted on being incorporated into the municipal government. In the afternoon, they surveyed the Huazhuang and Wengbanqiao areas. On the 5th, they surveyed Sanlin. County Magistrate Ni, Secretary Xie, and District Chief Xue accompanied them to inspect the area around Sanlin. Inspector Cheng also met with more than a hundred representatives of the people. The general opinions of the people were the same as in Minhang. On the 6th, they surveyed Dachang, listening to the opinions of the people. Gentry Wang Yingyou, business representative Yao Yiqun, school representative Chen Qingqi, people's representative Chen Fuxin, and more than two thousand people, including civilians and students, gathered in the square of the 24th District Public Office, unanimously demanding to be under the jurisdiction of Shanghai and opposing the Baoshan County government. Inspector Cheng then addressed all the civilians and students and met with representatives from all walks of life to inquire in great detail. Inspector Cheng then stated that he would be responsible for reporting the opinions of the people in the Dachang District to the Ministry of Interior and the Executive Yuan and wait for a reasonable resolution.</p>
<h3>District Briefs</h3>
<p>The 32nd District (Zhenru) has completed the copying of household registration, the original and duplicate copies, and six types of population statistics. The statistical tables were sent to the Civil Affairs Department on the morning of the 9th of this month.</p>
<p>The Mediation Committee of the 6th District (Loujiawan) has been organized in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Government and has received many requests for mediation from district residents. A preparatory meeting was held in the conference room of the District Public Office at 2:00 PM on the 5th of this month.</p>
<p>The "Taishan District News," published by the Taishan District News Agency at 145 Taicang Road in this city, has rich content and is well-printed. It is particularly well-informed about all civil affairs news in the 5th District. Since its publication, the circulation has been very large.</p>
<p>The 26th District (Caohong) Public Office held the second household administration symposium at 10:00 AM on the 6th of this month. Also, Lou Zhenyu, the full-time officer of the 9th Bao in the district, resigned. The vacancy was filled by Pan Songling, who was appointed by the district. Ye Qing, the full-time officer of the 15th Bao, resigned due to illness. The vacancy was filled by Fang Qide, who was appointed by the district.</p>
<p>When shrapnel flew everywhere in the Jiangwan Arsenal explosion the other day, the 21st District (Xinshi) Public Office urgently ordered the officers of the 7th, 8th, and 12th Bao in the district, which were close to the explosion area, to cooperate with the military police and the chiefs of each Bao to maintain order within the Bao, and the situation was quite good.</p>

<h3>The Northwest Corner of Jiangxi</h3>
<p>— A Naval Message Dated on the 2nd. Our Nanchang Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>Wu Ning is the hometown of the late Army General Li Xiehe. His ancestral home is in Shazixiang of the county. The General's coffin was transported from Chongqing to Jiangxi this spring and buried next to Xiehe Middle School in Shaxi Town, as he had instructed.</p>
<p>The General's revolutionary achievements are eternally remembered. The grand memorial services held in Xunyang and Gan, at which the General was mourned, reflected the respect of the people of Jiangxi for him. During this trip to northwestern Jiangxi, the reporter had a grand aspiration—to pay respects at the General's tomb to show his admiration. However, the day the reporter arrived at Shaxi was a clear day when the autumn colors were setting in the west. After just unloading the luggage, the reporter followed the directions of the locals and headed towards a small hill next to Xiehe Middle School. After searching the hilltop, the reporter only saw a mound of sand with a small bamboo sign in front of it that read, "Pedestrians Please Stop." At first, the reporter did not think that this was the General's tomb. Upon further inquiry, the locals informed the reporter that Li Xiehe, a figure with great feats, was lying right here.</p>
<p>The county seat is forty li from Shaxi. After a day's journey, going west from Shaxi, the population is denser, and the area is peaceful. However, the locals' lives are still a tough struggle, as seen by their pale faces and clothes that are patched and patched again, and by the "mourning color" mark worn: self-made shoes, white cloth on top [of the head].</p>
<h3>Wu Ning as a Cultural Center</h3>
<p>The political and cultural center of the Xiushui River valley and the Jiurui area is in Wu Ning because it is the location of the Ninth Administrative Commissioner's Office of Jiangxi Province. Kang Jinglian, who was involved in the Fengxin embezzlement of silver case, was the Fourth District Commissioner during the war. The current commissioner, Wu Xibai, is a forthright and poetry-loving person. Under the current economic and transportation difficulties, managing the politics and livelihood of this area is not an easy task. For example, the province ordered the repair of the county road from Xiushui through Wuning to Yongxiu, which is 300 li long. The province issued only an order and no funds for subsidies, and required the road to be opened to traffic by the end of this year.</p>
<p>He said, "If we cannot complete the task of opening to traffic by the deadline, we will be punished. But we cannot allocate funds or collect materials. Where does the money come from, and where do the materials come from? It is killing the commissioner and worrying the county magistrate! It is difficult to be an official today!"</p>
<p>Looking at the streets, Wuning has gradually recovered after the robbery. Especially in terms of education, it is indeed better than other counties. Shaxi has the provincial Xiehe Middle School, and the county seat has the county middle school and Zhenfeng Middle School. The students' standards and teachers are not bad. Some schools are willing to pay "black market subsidies" to hire better specialized teachers, which is enough to show the hard work of those responsible for education there.</p>
<p>However, the local gentry's power is quite strong. For example, the Li family in Guayuan Township currently has 6,000 mu of good land and more than a thousand fir-covered mountains. One family handles all the township's affairs. Also, the township areas bordering Hubei Province, because they are beyond the reach of the law, dominate one side. The county magistrate can only sigh helplessly.</p>

<h3>De'an After the Robbery: Only Five and a Half Houses Left</h3>
<p>After the robbery, De'an only had five and a half houses and 37,515 people who survived by the skin of their teeth. The desolation of the county seat is no less than that of Yongxiu. The sharp decline in the local population is terrifying, based on not very reliable statistics—before the Republic of China, the county's population was 130,000. In the first year of the Republic, it was 90,000. Before the war, it was 70,000. Now, it is only 37,515. Of the current population, some are from Henan and Hubei, most of whom came in the third year of the Republic due to famine in Henan and in the 19th year due to disaster. There are probably fewer than 20,000 real natives. It is said that the mortality rate in De'an has been very terrible in recent decades. In the past, farm families with more than ten people were very common, but now even a family of five is rare. Even the immigrants from Henan and Hubei are no exception.</p>
<h3>Funerals Without Coffins; County Government Serves as Temporary Residence</h3>
<p>The funeral held by the Zheng family in the county seat recently can be considered unprecedented in De'an. The guests who came to mourn included dignitaries from Beijing-Hankou-Nanchang, as well as relatives and friends from the village. Military vehicles, jeeps, Western-suited dignitaries, and modern ladies made the dilapidated city of De'an look like a modern Chinese city, with everything it should have. Of course, it was a grand funeral. In the "long snake formation" of the funeral procession, there were no coffins, because Zheng's ancestors had died of illness in other counties many years ago while fleeing the disaster and had already been buried. Zheng's mother's coffin was recently transported from Chongqing and was still on its way.</p>
<p>However, the Zheng family's funeral was a hardship for the county magistrate. Although visiting dignitaries could eat cigarettes of the third and fifth brands and sit in cars that moved slowly like turtles to escort the funeral, the "couch" for the night became a problem. The county government had to be temporarily used as a residence. The county magistrate, who suffered every day, had to welcome and entertain these visiting dignitaries. Precisely in this lively and festive occasion, the Jiangxi Provincial Government Inspection Group arrived and also had no hotel to stay in, so they borrowed the county government and strictly refused any entertainment, making the county magistrate in a dilemma. He had no choice but to put on a show of "one scene, two styles" and let the guests who stayed together not disclose the truth to each other.</p>

<h3>Stones and Soil Are Valuable Specialty Products in Xingzi County</h3>
<p>Xingzi is a mountainous and lacustrine area. The county seat leans against Mount Lu in the back and Lake Poyang in the front. Therefore, mountains account for four-tenths of the county's land area, and water accounts for 3.3 tenths. Cultivatable land accounts for only three-tenths. With the current population of 67,764 people, the limited land—680,000 mu—is not enough to be self-sufficient with the annual crops. Even the bumper harvest this year is estimated to be two months short of enough food. Moreover, the farmland water conservancy in Qiduwei in the northern part of the county and Liaohuachi has been in disrepair for many years, which has a significant impact on cultivation. As for Liaohuachi, the water from Dianshan Pass, Hualin Mountain, Huanglong Mountain, and Yayaoshan, ninety-nine of them, converge in this low-lying area—Liaohuachi. About 4,000 mu of farmland is flooded, and more than 10,000 mu of good farmland nearby are affected. The area of the pond reaches 50 li, with 87 villages and more than 2,100 households. It was once started to be dredged in the Yongzheng period, but the project was too large and has not been completed. The dikes in Qiduwei are also collapsing in the east and west. If the water level of Poyang Lake rises sharply and the waterway is blocked, then the water from Lianhua, Qidu, and other places will only cause disasters in every pass. Now, the people of the county unanimously demand that the government provide them with financial and technical assistance. If this water conservancy project is dredged and repaired, Xingzi's food problem will not be difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Jinxing Song inkstones and precious porcelain clay are all specialty products of Xingzi. People who visit Xingzi are even more interested in Song inkstones and buy them as souvenirs of their visit to Mount Lu or give them as gifts to friends. However, now, due to the high labor costs, an ordinary Song inkstone costs nearly 10,000 yuan. Although bright golden light appears in the shiny stone pool, the buyers feel that the price is too high, so sales are sluggish and production is low.</p>
<p>The porcelain of Jingdezhen is precious because the porcelain clay of Xingzi is precious. If a thin and bright porcelain is to be made, it cannot be made without Xingzi clay. In recent years, because of the decline of Jingdezhen porcelain, Xingzi clay has naturally collapsed along with it.</p>
<p>Now, Xingzi's famous products—Song inkstones and porcelain clay—are declining.</p>
<h3>An Eyewitness Account of the Shenzhen Bloodshed: On the "Freedom of Action" of British Troops</h3>
<p>— Wangri Kowloon Dispatch, Special Correspondent Cheng Zhang of This Newspaper</p>
<p>The news that a villager in Shenzhen was shot dead by British troops at 1:20 PM on the 3rd, within the Chinese territory of Wenjindu on the Sino-British border, spread. The next day, this reporter rushed from Guangzhou to Shenzhen. The case of Hong Kong hawker Wang Shuixiang being kicked to death by Portuguese police had not yet been resolved, and this unfortunate incident occurred at the Shenzhen border. In the past one or two months, British representatives of the people and prominent figures in industry and commerce have not hesitated to come to China from Europe, tirelessly conveying Britain's goodwill towards the Chinese nation, using giant special planes to fly back and forth in our major cities, drinking countless glasses of champagne, and repeatedly making speeches about Sino-British amity. If the facts show that this so-called goodwill and amity consist of fierce kicks from heavy boots and .303 caliber bullets, then the degree of our humiliation is far more than just "popular indignation"!</p>
<p>An Old Man Appeals for Justice</p>
<p>When this reporter arrived at the scene of the incident, the innocent victim was still lying on the roadside, guarded by our Chinese police officers with guns. The deceased was wearing a black velvet Zhongshan suit, his face was swollen, and a bullet had passed through the side of his right ear, his face a bloody mess, a gruesome sight. When this reporter was taking photos of the deceased, a decrepit old woman (the deceased's mother) ran over crying, asking us to seek justice for him, hitting her chest in grief, which was heartbreaking. The deceased was a kind commoner of the highest order who made a living as a "water carrier" (smuggler). In addition to his elderly mother, he also had a younger brother and sister, a family of four, all dependent on his two hands for support. But he was shot and killed by the British soldiers for no reason!</p>
<p>After thorough investigation and stern protests by our police and diplomatic personnel, at 7 PM on the 4th, the British Army Headquarters in Hong Kong issued a statement expressing regret and accepting full responsibility. (Editor's note: Please see yesterday's edition of this newspaper)</p>
<p>We Chinese people usually pride ourselves on being able to write "officialese," but after reading the British statement, we find that the British are also very skilled at writing. However, can flowery words and sophistry conceal ironclad facts?</p>
<p>A Gunshot Rang Out and He Fell to the Ground</p>
<p>The Sino-British border in Shenzhen is demarcated by the Shenzhen River. Wenjindu, the location of the incident, is the last stop on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway connecting to British territory. Taking a car from Kowloon in British territory, once you cross this, you enter the national border. Our side has set up a customs office about 100 meters from the riverbank. Many merchants (commonly known as "water carriers") pass back and forth every day. The British side has a small barracks on the other side of the riverbank. The British soldier who shot and killed the innocent Chinese commoner Zhang Tianxiang was stationed in that barracks. From where Zhang Tianxiang fell to the ground, this reporter looked across the river and saw a British military vehicle with a machine gun set up. Traffic on the bridge was normal, but there were few pedestrians, as if some of the somber atmosphere of yesterday still lingered. A customs officer who witnessed the tragedy told this reporter the following account:</p>
<p>"The tragedy occurred because of a young child. At the time, the girl was carrying a large bag of flour, which was intercepted by British soldiers when crossing the bridge from British territory. For some reason, the British soldiers beat the child severely. The child's cries attracted the villagers on the opposite bank. The British soldiers then followed the child into Chinese territory, and the villagers began to clamor. He (the customs officer) stepped forward to mediate, but the British soldier (later identified as Mike Robert, a junior lieutenant) forcefully said, "Within 100 feet of the border, I have complete freedom of action." Then, he reluctantly retreated. He returned to the customs office and suddenly heard a gunshot. The deceased fell to the ground. At the time, the villagers were emotionally agitated. Lin Wannian, the head of the Shenzhen Police Station, and Lu Shen, the transport commander of the military police, rushed to negotiate with the British troops. Yuan Zhichao, the head of the Shenzhen market town, did his best to persuade the villagers to maintain order, so the unfortunate incident did not escalate..."</p>
<p>Crossing the Border to Kill: A Hideous Face</p>
<p>This reporter found a representative from the Support Association in Wenjindu who was sent to Hong Kong to report. According to the Hong Kong newspapers, the representative reported the tragedy as follows: "Yesterday at 1:20 PM, a British soldier guarding the border in Wenjindu, Shenzhen, Bao'an County, Guangdong Province, crossed the border to chase two Chinese children, aged about thirteen or fourteen, carrying two small bags of white sugar and beat them. When the Shenzhen police saw this, they tried to dissuade him, which aroused the crowd of villagers watching. The British soldier retreated to British territory, and then led several British soldiers to the Wenjindu bridge spanning the two territories. They fired at the clamoring villagers, killing Zhang Tianxiang, a villager from the ninth Bao in Shenzhen. The crowd became even more indignant. Lu Shen, the transport commander of the Seventh Transport Company of the stationed Shenzhen military police, and Lin Wannian, the head of the Shenzhen Police Station, arrived at the scene after hearing the news and inquired about the truth. They then went to negotiate with the British guards in Wenjindu, but without result. The villagers, realizing the seriousness of the case, organized a Support Association that afternoon. On one hand, they asked the military police to guard Zhang's remains pending inspection, and on the other hand, they sent Wen Xuhua, the secretary of the county council, and Zheng Qichang, the section chief, to Hong Kong that evening to report the tragedy to the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, requesting them to negotiate with the British side."</p>
<p>Combining this report with the above interview with the customs officer, we can understand the course of the tragedy. A hideous face of the British troops in Hong Kong, "crossing the border to shoot and kill," flashes before our eyes. Is this a manifestation of Sino-British cooperation? We want to ask Prime Minister Attlee and appeal to people of the world who uphold justice and freedom.</p>
<p>When this reporter left Shenzhen, I could not forget the victim Zhang Tianxiang, who was shot and killed and left lying on the road, and even more, I could not forget his grief-stricken old mother and those righteously indignant people!</p>

<h3>War Clouds Looming: The Overall Situation in Shandong</h3>
<p>— Jinan Dispatch, May 5, Special Correspondent He Bingru of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Before the issuance of the order to cease conflict reached Shandong, after the Jiaoji Railway was cleared by the National Army, the cities and counties controlled by the government included Jinan City, Licheng, Qihe, Changqing, Ziyang, Liaocheng, Yuncheng, Changle, Anqiu, Jimo, Jiaoxian, Yidu, Linzi, Zichuan, Boshan, Changshan, Zouping, Zhangqiu, Changyi, Gaomi, Caoxian, Shanxian, Yutai, Chengwu, Dingtao, Jiaxiang, Juye, Heze, Jining, Yixian, Jinxiang, Dancheng, Ningyang, Pingdu, and Yexian, a total of thirty-five. A scene of improvement was once revealed. Since then, until recently, the situation in Shandong has turned into a looming war cloud.</p>
<p>This situation was caused by two prominent factors: (1) After the order to cease conflict reached Shandong, Wang Yaowu, the commander of the Second Pacification Zone, immediately ordered the National Army and security forces in Shandong to comply with the order, hold their original defenses, and stop advancing. This has been implemented until now, and the slogan "Rather be beaten than disobey orders" has been silently recited in the hearts of the soldiers. However, people have blood and spirit, and when pushed too hard, they will always fight back. Therefore, although there have been no major battles in Shandong recently, small clashes are still inevitable. (2) The Communist Army, in such a favorable opportunity, has indeed been able to obtain troop replenishment and fully deploy its independent activities on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Based on the information obtained by the government here, the movements of the Communist Army in Shandong indeed show signs of an active major battle. Communist Army General He Long led his troops from Shanxi through Cangxian to Dezhou in northern Shandong and convened a meeting of military and political personnel from the First Military Subdistrict of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, deciding to implement extensive conscription of soldiers and grain in his area, organizing stretcher, transport, and dare-to-die teams, attempting to clear the Jinpu Railway. Liu Bocheng's First, Third, and Yang Yong's Seventh Columns, nearly 50,000 men, plus local militia teams, totaling about 100,000, have begun to operate in southwestern Shandong and have already captured Juancheng and surrounded Dancheng. Communist Army footprints have also been found in the suburbs of Jinxiang County. Their purpose is to block the National Army from going north to support the southbound Communist Army. Chen Yi, the commander of the New Fourth Army, has been in Gaomi, repeatedly consulting with the heads of military and political affairs in the central, eastern, and coastal areas of Shandong to plan two offensives along the Jiaoji Railway in southeastern Shandong. Recently, new forces have been added, including the First, Second, and Third Armies of the "Liberation Alliance Army," which have entered Yishui from the mountainous areas of southwestern Shandong, preparing to participate in the Jiaodong campaign. Their original Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Liberation Divisions, and the Third and Fifth Police Brigades, are scattered in the outer areas of the National Army in Jiaoxian, Gaomi, Zichuan, Boshan, and Yexian. Their Seventh Liberation Division, after capturing Qidong, is still operating in the area north of the Xiaoching River. As for the coastal ports of Binzhou and Yantai in Shandong Province, there is a constant flow of Communist Army troop and ammunition replenishment ships. Under the current circumstances in Shandong, the National Army is indeed trapped in a Communist Army encirclement and feels restricted.</p>
<p>Recently, the Communist Army is preparing to divide the southeastern half of Shandong into three military centers, taking Gaomi in Jiaodong as the center, attempting to cut off the Jiaoji Railway and restore its transportation corridor. In the central Shandong area, they will take Zichuan and Boshan as the center, with the aim of capturing the Zibo mining area and connecting it with its base area in the mountainous region of southern Shandong. In addition, they will concentrate their forces, seizing opportunities to compete with the National Army for Jinan, in order to shake the government's military and political center of gravity in Shandong. On the 4th of this month, another Communist Army unit of over 10,000 men moved from Laiwu to Xiying, on the border of Tai'an and Licheng, only 50 li away from Jinan City. The purpose is still to be proved by facts, but it cannot be denied that Jinan is feeling threatened.</p>
<p>Currently, the entire situation in Shandong has reached a stage of imminent war, with fierce battles seemingly likely to break out anytime, anywhere. However, one side is complying with the ceasefire order and cannot launch an offensive, while the other side has suffered repeated blows and its overall strength is insufficient, and is still waiting for something. As for the National and Communist Armies, they both seem to focus on the Jiaoji Railway line in eastern Shandong. The current situation of the National Army is to ensure the Jiaoji Railway's transportation is advantageous. But if the National Army can always maintain this advantageous condition, then the Communist Army will never have a corridor, and its connection with the Northeast, all the way to northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong, in terms of land and sea transportation, will feel ineffective. This is the focus that both sides will desperately fight for in the future. If the overall situation of the country can be resolved in the future, the looming war clouds can gradually dissipate.</p>
<h3>The Desolate Baoshan</h3>
<p>— 3rd Dispatch, Zhongying</p>
<p>Saishan City is so desolate that there is hardly any commerce. The so-called most vibrant West Gate Street has very few people walking during the day, and it is as cold and desolate as death at night. We walked alone on the street and only saw a few small restaurants and tobacco shops with their doors half-closed. People who want to buy clothing, stationery, and daily necessities must travel far to the countryside to buy them, because the market towns in the countryside are much more lively than the city. Isn't this a strange phenomenon? Baoshan has no entertainment venues, only a small teahouse with a dozen or so people listening to the storytelling of Shuangzhufeng. This is Baoshan's only entertainment venue. As for movies, Peking Opera, and plays, they would never even dream of them. The most difficult thing in Baoshan is that if you get sick, you can't find a doctor. Although the county government runs a health hospital, it has no funds, so there are no medicines. Therefore, you have to go to another place for treatment, or you will just die of illness. Don't you think this is a very difficult thing?</p>
<p>Education is in Decline, but the County Government is Honest</p>
<p>Education in Baoshan was originally very developed, but it has been affected by the past wars. Moreover, due to the current financial difficulties of the county government, teachers' salaries have not been paid for several months, so education has suddenly become bankrupt.</p>
<p>Baoshan has five districts: Chengxiang, Yuepu, Luodian, Liuhang, and Dachang. The total population of the county is over 135,000, and the population of Baoshan County is around 3,000. County Magistrate Cheng Daomin is very honest and upright, and is deeply loved and trusted by the general public. County Magistrate Cheng is very frugal. His daily allowance for food, morning, noon, and evening meals, is only 300 yuan. Indeed, he shares joys and hardships with his subordinates. He is diligent and loves the people, which is rare in today's society where corruption is rampant.</p>

<h3>The Education and Care of Children with Learning Disabilities</h3>
<p>— Yu Renfeng</p>
<p>Modern education has shifted from a general approach to an individualized one. Because of the different levels of children's knowledge and the differences in their personalities, there are distinctions between gifted, normal, and children with learning disabilities. Generally speaking, normal children account for the largest number, while gifted and children with learning disabilities are relatively few. Throughout history, humankind seems to have only focused on cultivating children with outstanding talents while neglecting children with learning disabilities. This is their misfortune, and it is also a flaw in humanity. Therefore, we should also teach according to their abilities, so that they can develop their intelligence and adapt to life as much as possible.</p>
<p>In general, parents use the same methods to educate and care for all their children. But for children with learning disabilities, they even abandon their responsibility to educate them. Especially because of the underdeveloped education in our country and the lack of special facilities, children with learning disabilities have suffered misfortune. Their existence is only pain and a burden. In view of this, the author would like to offer a few suggestions to modern parents who have children with learning disabilities.</p>
<p>(1) What is a Learning Disability?</p>
<p>There are various definitions and explanations of learning disabilities. Some scholars believe that it is a difference in quality, that is, low intelligence; another says it is a difference in quantity, in other words, a learning disability is not a lack of intelligence, but simply a difference in the amount of knowledge and ability. However, we are not going to discuss the principles. We can get a more precise answer from both physiological and psychological perspectives.</p>
<p>(1) Physiological reasons: A learning disability is a serious and permanent neurological defect due to the underdevelopment of nerve tissue.</p>
<p>(2) Psychological reasons: A learning disability is the underdevelopment or defect of the mind, which occurs before or after birth and affects intellectual judgment and understanding. This defect is difficult to cure.</p>
<p>(3) "Eugenics" explanation: It is inherited from the improper reproduction of the nation.</p>
<p>After looking at the above answers, we may confuse "learning disability" with "dullness." Therefore, it must be noted here that any slow progress or temporary mental defect is not a learning disability, because it is temporary and can be restored to normal with proper guidance and treatment.</p>
<p>(2) Special Education for Children with Learning Disabilities</p>
<p>(1) Focus on physical and skill training: Although children with learning disabilities can also read and calculate, it is very limited. Except for children with self-inflicted injuries and children with learning disabilities with incurable major defects, we should focus on training them in life skills. Therefore, physical training and ability-based education should take up most of the time. Simple and crude activities such as walking, running, jumping, sweeping, washing, hammering nails, and making simple chairs and tables are most suitable. Because they have psychological defects, most of them do not like to move. We can encourage them to play games to arouse their interest in activity, because this is of great importance in training and teaching.</p>
<p>(2) Intellectual education should be gradual: As I said above, children with learning disabilities lack general intelligence. They are very weak in terms of comprehension, judgment, and learning ability. Therefore, we must hone their thinking ability and muscle movements. Various building block toys are good teaching tools that they can play with. On the one hand, use physical activities to allow them to grow and be active appropriately. However, no matter what educational methods are used, they must always be lower than the capabilities of all normal children, and they should be taught patiently. Appropriate learning steps are a condition for success in education. It is bound to fail if children with learning disabilities are asked to do complex problems beyond their comprehension.</p>
<p>(3) Repetition of stimuli: Children with learning disabilities often do not have a complete response. Due to the relatively slow action of the nervous system, they are difficult to cope with if the stimuli are too fast. Therefore, let them repeatedly practice a response in the same environment so that it becomes a habit. When faced with the same situation, they will react very familiarly. After one stimulus is successful, give a new one, which is effective.</p>
<p>(4) Give Sympathy and Pleasure: It is a common feature of animals to choose and learn the reactions that produce pleasure; conversely, they eliminate and discard the reactions that produce unpleasantness. This principle should be used more appropriately for children with learning disabilities. Do not dislike them because of trouble and impatience. We should think of their plight and give them more sympathy, so that they will not be further suppressed in their hearts.</p>
<p>(5) Designing the Application of Education: In games and daily life environments, guide them to learn many useful skills. That kind of efficiency can never be achieved through books. For example, children like to organize families. We can use that opportunity to let them perform their duties in the family and teach them various knowledge that they should have. The design education method takes the child's interests as the discussion goal, but it should also expand the scope as much as possible, so that children with learning disabilities can achieve greater results in intensive training.</p>
<p>(6) Proper Guidance of Instinct: The instincts and emotions of children with learning disabilities are not defective due to lack of intelligence. Ordinary children with learning disabilities have the instincts that ordinary children should have. However, we should pay attention to the lack of self-control in children with learning disabilities—strong instinctual emotions and weak intellect. Therefore, moral education is even more important for children with learning disabilities. We should make them know the difference between good and evil. Instinctive impulses should have proper expression and handling, especially sexual instincts. According to Gulik's investigation, children with learning disabilities have strong heterosexual instincts, but due to their lack of rational restraint, many adult individuals with learning disabilities commit illegitimate births, illegal unions, or other illegal sexual acts. Therefore, sexual hygiene and morality should be made known to them. Pay attention to any immoral behavior that occurs. The obedience instinct of children with learning disabilities is obvious. They are easily exploited and seduced, easily commanded, and easily deceived. The most appropriate way to avoid this is to isolate them from bad environments to avoid external seduction, in addition to giving them moral and ethical concepts. If you don't pay attention to it early on, it will be difficult to change the habit once it is formed.</p>
<p>(7) On Rewards and Punishments for Children with Learning Disabilities: Since children with learning disabilities do not understand the natural cause and effect of good and evil and suffering and pleasure, we should cultivate good habits in them. On the one hand, after good and evil behaviors are expressed, give them appropriate rewards and punishments, so that the rewards for good and punishments for evil are inextricably linked. Our rewards and punishments for children with learning disabilities cannot be based on normal children. Some normal children do not even know the difference between good and evil behaviors, let alone children with learning disabilities. It is like a lame person cannot be blamed for staggering, they should be specially trained and forgiven. As for the methods of rewards and punishments, concrete things should be used, methods that are obvious and have immediate consequences. Using toys and candies as prizes, not allowing them to play with a certain utensil, not allowing them to eat a certain kind of candy, and not allowing them to play with their companions are all good methods of rewards and punishments. Our attitude should be gentle, but not too indulgent. However, I always oppose physical punishment, and it should not be used on children with learning disabilities, because we are calling on them to repent, not calling on them not to do it because of fear. The effect I want is permanent, not temporary.</p>
<h3>Dad Wants to Take Him on a Trip</h3>
<h3>Gambling Harms Shanghai Women</h3>
<p>— Duyun</p>
<p>When I was young in the Ningbo countryside, I never saw women sitting and playing cards, because at that time, people generally regarded women playing cards as vulgar. But I never thought that in today's Shanghai, women generally regard playing cards as a daily routine and are not ashamed of it. In fact, it really harms Shanghai women.</p>
<p>1. Neglecting Household Chores: In order to play cards, women cook hastily, do not repair their clothes, and do not even sweep the floor or make the bed, letting the furnishings be messy and do not care.</p>
<p>2. Treating Guests Rudely: When guests come to visit or negotiate business, the hostess is playing cards, and no tea or water is offered. She just sits there, turning her back to the guests, making the guests feel bored and leave.</p>
<p>3. Indulging Children: When the mother plays cards, the children think their chance has come. Asking for money is especially easy, developing wasteful habits, buying things to eat randomly, not counting hygiene; wandering outdoors, neglecting their studies, if left to the maid, they will not receive proper training.</p>
<p>4. Family Discord: Gamblers take money lightly and often blame their husbands for earning too little. They are enthusiastic about gambling and treat their husbands with cold affection. Because the family life is disorderly, it causes the husband to be critical. Over time, cases of deteriorating situations are not uncommon!</p>
<p>5. Damage to Health: Women who are enthusiastic about playing cards, some with disheveled hair and dirty faces, do not repair their appearance, do not wear clothes in time for cold and warm weather; they do not eat when hungry, forming stomach problems; in addition, the current card games are varied, requiring a lot of brainpower and excessive thinking, causing insomnia, becoming increasingly old, and even shortening their lifespan, which is not an exaggeration.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Household Records</h3>
<p>— Qingxi</p>
<p>For wooden utensils stained with oil, washing them with tea leaves is very effective.</p>
<p>Putting a little bit of firewood ash in a vase can make the flowers last longer.</p>
<p>White clothes should be dried in the sun, not in the shade, otherwise they will turn yellow and cannot be washed white again next time.</p>
<p>When washing velvet, add a little ammonia water to the water, and the dirt will immediately be removed, which has the effect of restoring the old to new.</p>
<h3>For Young Ladies</h3>
<p>— Meng Jin</p>
<p>One knows everyone under the sun, yet has not even one or two confidants. Making friends is already not an easy matter, how much more so when choosing a spouse? Especially for women, once married, they must take on the responsibility of educating and raising children, dedicating their energy to the family. A man can marry a wife without ability, but if a woman marries a husband without ability, she will have to starve with him. However, it doesn't matter much if a man marries ten years later, but if a woman gets a little older, she'll feel anxious. In other words, the period for a woman to choose a spouse is shorter. Women mostly like young, handsome men with status, but such men are hard to find in the world. A young man can't have status, and a man with status is often already gray at the temples and probably has children already. As for young, handsome playboys, they show their special status by relying on their fathers and brothers' blessings, but these types are mostly without promise and not ideal husbands. Precisely because of this, many women often miss their youth because their conditions are too harsh.</p>
<p>Secondly, women who don't thoroughly understand love all like men who are considerate and meticulous during the pursuit period. In their eyes, as long as a man is gentle, love is guaranteed. Little do they know that a man is, after all, a man. A man who doesn't dare to get angry or fierce is either without promise or hypocritical. Every promising young man has his own self-esteem and ambition. He may sacrifice everything for his lover, but during the pursuit period, his expression is restrained and he easily knows when to stop. He doesn't easily pursue women, but if he is met with a cold shoulder after pursuing, he will immediately turn around. This type of man seems difficult to grasp, but once brought under control, his love is often pure and reliable. Conversely, those considerate and meticulous men are mostly skilled in love affairs and the least reliable. During the dating period, they are an ideal lover, but after marriage, they are husbands of divided loyalty. The difficulty for women in choosing a spouse lies in the fact that good men don't desperately pursue, and those who desperately pursue are mostly not good men. Everyone acknowledges that Washington and Lincoln were good men full of passion, but how many women in America at that time had the discerning eye to recognize heroes?</p>
<p>From a person's breadth of mind, you can see their entire personality and future. A person who only knows how to plan for themselves and only knows how to show off, the more sickening their sweet words, the more it reveals their insignificance. Young ladies! Please pay attention.</p>

<h3>How Sesame Cakes are Made</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Cooking is something housewives should study. When your husband returns from the office, he is tired. If you can make a delicious snack or a hearty dinner, you will not only learn more cooking skills, but also make your husband forget his fatigue and enhance the love between husband and wife.</p>
<p>Now I will write down the "sesame cake" method below.</p>
<p>Ingredients – flour, oil, sugar, water, etc.</p>
<p>Method – Divided into three steps: flaky pastry, outer skin, and filling.</p>
<p>(1) Making flaky pastry – Place the flour in a bowl, melt the lard until it is watery, pour it into the flour bowl, mix it into a lump, knead it evenly, roll it into a long strip, cut it into small pieces, and then roll each piece into a round shape, like a longan.</p>
<p>(2) Making the outer skin – The method is the same as above. But mix two-thirds water with one-third oil, mix into a lump, also cut into small pieces, and roll into a round shape, the size of a longan.</p>
<p>(3) Making the filling – The method is the same, also using only oil to mix the flour, but add white sugar, knead, cut into pieces, and then roll into a round shape, the size of a longan.</p>
<p>Once all three types are made, combine them.</p>
<p>The method of combining is like making dumplings. First, knead the outer skin piece into a concave-convex shape, put the flaky pastry piece inside as a filling, wrap it up, and roll it into a round shape. Then, knead this round piece into a concave-convex shape again, put the filling piece inside as a filling, wrap it up, and roll it into a round shape. Then flatten it, but the periphery must still maintain a round color.</p>
<p>After making the cake dough in this way, it can be baked. Baking method: First heat the pot, spread a layer of oil on the surface of the pot, and then arrange the cake doughs one by one into the pot, turning them over several times, baking until they are yellow and cooked but not burnt, then you can shovel them up.</p>
<p>If, after the cake dough is made, you want to add some decoration, there are three convenient methods. You might as well try them.</p>
<p>(1) Use the teeth of a clean comb (the kind used for haircuts) to imprint diamond-shaped patterns or hexagonal patterns of dotted lines on the surface of the cake dough.</p>
<p>(2) Use large hemp seeds (like a chrysanthemum stamp) or sesame husks (her cross-section becomes a plum blossom stamp), dip them in some grease and water, and imprint scattered flower patterns on the surface.</p>
<p>(3) If you want to imprint raised patterns, you can use a yin-patterned mold, like stamping sugar cakes.</p>
<p>Attached are two baking methods:</p>
<p>(A) Roasted spare ribs (Cantonese call it "char siu") Specially take the muscle and tendon parts of the ribs with some fat, remove the ribs, stuff them with scallions, and bake them on charcoal. At the same time, use vinegar and soy sauce to frequently coat them, so that they are flavorful (those who don't like vinegar can omit it), and bake until the inside is thoroughly cooked and the surface is slightly charred.</p>
<p>(B) Roasted chicken and roasted duck: Submerge the tender chicken or tender duck that has been slaughtered and washed in soy sauce for half a day, take it out and let it air dry slightly, and roast it over charcoal. Turn it over from time to time, and do not let it burn. Frequently coat the skin with sesame oil, and roast until it is thoroughly cooked inside and out.</p>
<p>The above two are very easy for ordinary, capable housewives to do, and I hope readers will try it.</p>

<h3>Opera of Qing Dynasty Painters</h3>
<p>— Zhen Zhi</p>
<p>Qing Dynasty painters who were also opera writers, according to records, include: Zhang Qu, Yan Baoyong, Wan Rong'en, Tang Yifen, Yao Meibo and others. There are many extant zaju and chuanqi plays written by them. Descriptions are given separately below:</p>
<p>Zhang Qu</p>
<p>Jiang Baoling's "Molin Jinhua" Volume 10, "Zhang Qingzhai's Painting Follows the Northern School" says:</p>
<p>"Zhang Qingzhai Qu, a native of Xiaoshan, became a student in his youth and once stayed in the capital. He was famous for writing both northern and southern tunes. The two chuanqi plays he wrote, "Furong Tower" and "Yujie Ji", have been published, and the Peking Opera troupes in the capital competed to perform them. His "Xinfang Lu" (which contains very detailed information about the Donglin party members), "Xianxian Tang Ji" and other books have not been published. He is still healthy at the age of eighty-odd this year. His painting follows the Northern School and is full of strangeness." According to Zhang's two chuanqi plays both exist, published by Xianfeng Koubozhai. Mr. Zheng Xidi has both, and the Peking Library and Wu Mei each have one copy of "Furong Tower". Yao Xie's "Jin Yue Kaozheng" records (ten) included. Jiao Xun's "Qu Kao" and Wang's "Qu Lu" attribute "Furong Tower" to Jian Shan's work, suspecting that it is a different book with the same name, because Jian Shan also has another play called "Yishui Ge", which was not written by Zhang.</p>
<p>Yan Baoyong</p>
<p>"Molin Jinhua" Volume 11, "Sketching Master's Acupuncture Needle for Music" records Yan's:</p>
<p>"Yan Danchang Baoyong, named Wenqiao, a native of Dantu, passed the Yimao provincial examination first. I first met him at the county government. He often had merry gatherings with Lord Weng Haicun, Gai Qixiang, Liao Peizhou, and Lin Zi'an. People sometimes joked about his being a "Relieved First Scholar", which he did not enjoy. Later, he entered the Hanlin Academy and was changed to county magistrate. He served in Qixia, Shandong for two years, earning a reputation for good governance. He returned home because of his mother's death and never went out again, showing his indifference to fame and wealth. He was determined to study hard, believing that his poems, ancient prose and lyrics were not as good as those of the ancients, but he felt no shame in writing chuanqi plays. His "Tongxin Yan", "Qihua Jian", "Honglou Xinqu" and other zaju plays were popular in the capital. Tang Taoshan Fangbo wrote a poem for him: "The child is also a well-known inferior scholar, and musicians compete to sing the poems in his books," which is a factual account. His paintings of orchids and bamboos have a refined charm, and he also dabbles in freehand flower paintings. He once cited Wu Meicun's seven characters "seems to be able to get the meaning of flowers" as acupuncture needles for sketching artists to live in the world, which connoisseurs approve of." According to Zhi Fengyi's "Qu Mu Biao" and "Jin Yue Kaozheng" (five), in addition to the above three types in the Qing Zaju section, there are two other types: "Tun Yue Bao" and "Shuangyan Ji". In addition, there are three types: "Wangfu Shi", "Gui Wei Feng", and "Yulan Meng", which still exist today.</p>
<p>Tang Yifen</p>
<p>"Molin Jinhua" Volume 15, "Painting Appraisal and Analysis" records Tang Yifen:</p>
<p>"General Tang Yusheng Yifen, styled Ruobi, later called himself Zhou Weng, was a native of Wujin. Because of his grandfather's difficulties, he inherited the title of Yunqi Lieutenant in his youth and became the Sanjiang Defender, serving successively in Guangdong, Shanxi and Zhejiang. He was refined and honest, and the bandits disappeared at the news of his arrival. Later, as the Central Military Counselor of the Pacifying Standard, he was promoted to the Deputy General of Wenzhou, but he did not go due to illness. He retired to Xiangmen and rented the garden of Zhou Jinshi Baoxu to live in, intending to end his days in seclusion. The General had an outstanding talent and could delve deeply into astronomy, geography, and the learning of the hundred schools. His calligraphy, painting, poetry and prose were all masterpieces. He loved drinking and was skilled at playing the qin." According to Tang, he died as a martyr when the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom captured Nanjing in the third year of Xianfeng. The "Huamei Lou Poems and Lyrics" in the same book also record:</p>
<p>"I heard that the General was deeply proficient in music and created "Tixian Ge Three Pieces", ordering the maids in his family to sing them, and they could all sing them fluently. This also has a special implication, and is not the Eastern Mountain silk and bamboo music that expresses the feelings of middle age." According to Tang, there is a zaju play called "Xiaoyao Jin", a manuscript of which is stored in the Peking Library, and Lu Qian once engraved it in "Yin Hongyi Congke". The play is divided into four acts: Xun Chun, Bu Meng, Na Fang, and Jin Meng, and it tells the story of Tang's trip to Weizhou and his friendship with the Weizhou Lieutenant Xu Zirong. It is his own narration and is of little value. "Jin Yue Kaozheng" records (ten) that there is also a chuanqi play called "Jian Ren Yuan", but no copies have been found. If these two are all within the "Tixian Ge Three Pieces", the remaining one is a zaju or chuanqi play with an unknown name.</p>
<p>Yao Xie</p>
<p>"Molin Jinhua" Volume 18, "Yao Xiaolian" says:</p>
<p>"Yao Yeqiao Xie of Zhenhai, styled Meibo, a Jiashen Juren. He was skilled at painting, excelled at ink plum blossoms, line drawing of figures, and freehand flower paintings, all of which were in the ancient style. In the spring of Gengzi, when you went north from Wumen, I, Jie Zhisheng, saw him off at Liangxi and traveled with him to Dengwei and Huishan before returning. On the boat, I wrote a "Xiangjiang You Si Tu" Langtaosha Ci for Zhisheng: "Poetry dreams hold orchid quilts, the water vapor is heavy; Mount Emei hangs small in the twilight, the light Tuo Xiang traces are clipped in autumn. People's words are smoky, when will the book paste be found? The vast shore is deep in the sky, and the goddess of the Luo River contains love and plays with secluded birds. Sing to the misty water and clouds song, the jade flute blows the qin." He has engraved "Shuying Lou Ci" in eight volumes. He is also good at music and has two chuanqi plays, "Tui Hong Shan" and "Mei Qin Xue", as well as "Ci Lu Kanwu" and several volumes of poetry and prose collections." According to Yao, he is known to the world for his book "Jin Yue Kaozheng". He compiled "Jin Yuefu Xuan" in five hundred volumes. The two chuanqi plays he wrote are not recorded in his own "Jin Yue Kaozheng". Ma Yuzao's postscript said that each play has eight volumes, but neither has a transmitted copy.</p>
<p>Wan Rong'en</p>

<h3>A Proof of the Westward Movement of Our Culture</h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>Since the Yining Incident, the government has attached great importance to defending the Northwest. This decision of the National Assembly also involves border issues. According to the author, the great Chinese nation is formed by the cultural fusion of many ethnic groups. As evidenced by history, the Han Chinese of today, their earliest ancestors also moved from the Northwest to the Southeast; and the origin is often more distant than today's Northwest frontier. In fact, Asian human civilization originated in Central Asia and Western Asia. Western scholars have repeatedly made discoveries. Following the traces of its development, one branch moved eastward, with some staying in today's Northwest, and some further extending eastward and southeastward to the Central Plains, gaining the help of superior natural conditions and promoting today's Han civilization.</p>
<p>Anyone with a little historical knowledge should know that the founding of China began with the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan. According to historical records, the title of Xuanyuan originated from the fact that the Emperor was born on the Hill of Xuanyuan, and therefore took it as his clan name. Xuan, compared to Hill, is noted to be in the territory of present-day Henan Province; the years are distant, and it is difficult to obtain strong corroborating evidence. The author believes that the interpretation of Xuanyuan is car-like, and the Yellow Emperor invented the compass, whose legacy is still an auxiliary tool for navigation today. In fact, the Yellow Emperor at that time led his clan to expand eastward, just like Columbus exploring the New World, relying on the compass, from the Northwest Plateau, folded along the mountains to the south and rushed to the Central Plains. Suddenly discovered a plain with fertile soil and a temperate climate, and could not help but cheer "Hua", Hua means beautiful, so the name of the Chinese nation was determined. The natives of the Central Plains, still untamed, suddenly saw a large number of eastern migrants descend, and could not name them, so they named them the Xuanyuan clan, just like today's naming of tank teams and armored vehicle teams.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor, with superior equipment, overcame the native leader Chi You, hung down clothes and made calendars, established officials and set music, and his wife Lei Zu, promoted the benefits of sericulture, laying the cornerstone of Chinese civilization.</p>
<p>Therefore, we people do not need to distinguish between Han and border people from Northwest compatriots at all, because ancestors and grandchildren have passed down through hundreds of generations, and they are of the same lineage, so it is impossible to separate and unnecessary to separate.</p>

<h3>Western Mirror</h3>
<p>— Xia Dang</p>
<p>Xia Dang (Simeon Chardin 1699-1779) was a famous painter of the French Rococo era, as famous as Hua Zi, but with different styles. He abandoned the luxurious and leisurely worldliness of the time and specialized in studying the various dynamics of daily life that are eye-catching. As a subject matter, the style is more realistic. He made the most still lifes in his life, and also often made sketches. This "Western Mirror" is one of them. (Lion)</p>
<h3>Franz Schubert's Last Writing…</h3>
<p>— Written by A. Walker Tax, Translated by Li Mengfei</p>
<p>This is a story about the last days of the young musician Franz Schubert (1797-1828), written with the utmost respect and affection. And strangely enough, it is also the story of his life—constantly playing his noble and eternal melodies in a romantic life of sorrow and distress.</p>
<p>One day in November 1828, Franz Schubert died of typhoid fever in his brother's house outside Vienna. Only a year before, when Beethoven closed his eyes and passed away, he held a torch and was one of the participants in the funeral procession. When they buried the saint of music in the flower garden, on the way back, they walked into a tavern, and it was Schubert who raised his glass to the crowd and toasted: "Who will be the successor to the saint of music Beethoven?" But the shadow of death soon fell on this unfortunate, miserable, fat, unkempt young man, his nearsighted eyes, his desolate mood, no longer had his charming, beautiful songs to offer to the world.</p>
<p>After that, who will bring us these gifts full of love, joyous praises, genuine feelings of natural expression, and fascinating melodies—only he, an inexhaustible source of music. However, in November 1828, after freezing his short life, it was no longer possible to hear even a trace of his voice. His exuberant talent for composition, when he was composing four-part harmonies, he needed an assistant to copy for him. Every time the sun sets and the nightingale sings, his Serenade may pale in comparison.</p>
<p>But when people light the lights, Schubert's Serenade is remembered again. This is one that will not be forgotten in his entire life. Yes, he will remember it forever. This immortal song was written to celebrate a girl's birthday. On that day, the author also had to attend in person to accompany the choir. In the twilight, the piano was moved to the garden, and the choir gathered under the window of the girl he loved, but Franz, he, he forgot to come.</p>
<p>Although he died at the age of only thirty-one, his works have exceeded a thousand. All his property on the list, according to the highest market price, was valued at eight shillings and six pence, including the original manuscripts of great works in the last year. In fact, Schubert's long-lost noble manuscripts were scattered throughout Vienna. A generation later, the young O'Shaughnessy and his friend Groh came from England by sea and anxiously opened a forgotten private room and found the missing parts of Rosamunds. After a long midnight, they excavated Schubert's treasure. When the golden mist rose, the transcription work was completed. Because they were young, they were passionately in love with Franz Schubert. They could not suppress their emotions and could only play hopscotch to express them until the cafe opened.</p>
<p>Schubert's prolificacy has often been ridiculed as the reason for his poverty and destitution. He could compose twelve songs in one day. He naively wanted to exchange his works for a rich price from a publisher. But the twenty-four songs that Schubert sold to him a month ago have not yet been printed!</p>
<p>So, what was Schubert's last writing? Yes, it was a letter, a letter written to his friend Schober. At the beginning of this year, the two of them lived together in the Blue Hedgehog, until the King of Songs could not even pay half the rent before moving out.</p>
<p>Dear Schober:</p>
<p>I am sick. I haven't eaten anything for twelve days. I feel very tired and shaken and can only support going back and forth from the bed to the chair. Lina is serving me. Even a little taste is still vomited out. In this distressing situation, reading is my most intimate help. I have finished reading Cooper's (Note) "The Last of the Mohicans," "The Spy," "The Pilot," and "The Pioneer." If you have Cooper's books, please hand them over to Mrs. Kogner in the coffee shop. My brother will bring them to me very carefully. Or other books are also fine.</p>
<p>Your friend Schubert November 11, 1828</p>
<p>If you think this letter is lovely, it may be because it was discovered many years later, his past misfortune, which everyone paid attention to with a tight heart, a message that is still of value today. The regret is that Chang Xupei was lying in bed, eagerly looking forward to Cooper's "The Deerslayer", but this book was not completed before Schubert's death in 1828. …</p>
<p>Although Schubert is lying in his peaceful cemetery, in this resting place full of musical atmosphere, the sparrows flying down will also be close to him, listening to the beating of his gentle heart.</p>

<h3>A Shard of Land, A Rain of Blood 118</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Although Tsurumi was quite shocked at this moment, he was fortunate to have anticipated this move, and had not lied. However, he still broke out in a cold sweat. On the spot, he could only flip through the report, while trying his best to suppress his tense emotions. The report clearly recorded his every move since he got off the plane, as well as what happened at the Black Dragon Society. Even the content of the several phone calls he made at the dance hall were recorded verbatim. It even mentioned how "Number Zero Twelve" brought people to the outside of the "New Green" dance hall and how they dealt with those who were tracking Tsurumi, and how they set an ambush here and sent Tsurumi's driver away.</p>
<p>As Tsurumi read on, the cold sweat on his body soaked his back. "How formidable!" he exclaimed to himself in astonishment. In just over ten minutes, he skimmed through the report. Then, he stealthily took out Pingzi's small note from a hidden place under his clothing and asked the concubine to hand it to Konoe. He also truthfully explained how he had replaced the note at the last minute due to his fear. Konoe heard this and burst into a strange laugh:</p>
<p>"Very good! Let me tell you, I don't care about your personal affairs. And let me tell you, although you don't know what Miss Nakamura wrote, I can tell you! It's quite ingenious, perhaps there's a hint of fate in it. According to you, what you wrote on the paper was just a random phrase you saw on the hanging screen in the guest room. However, what Ms. Pingzi wrote happened to be the same, with only one word different. You wrote: 'Spring flowers, autumn moon, casually pass the time, how much of the past, you know yourself.' Her first line is exactly the same as yours, but the second line is: 'How much of the past, I hope you know.'"</p>
<p>"However, this one-word difference is significant! Why does she hope you know her past? You don't know, but I do! Because she has admired you for several years... Haha, her feelings for you are very deep!... This is something to celebrate!" Konoe said, and ordered the concubine, "Serve wine."...</p>
<p>North of Fukushima, near the sea, there is a small place called Matsushima, which is not well-known, but the scenery is excellent. This place is five or six hours by train from Tokyo. Tsurumi suffered for several hours at Konoe's place. When he came out, it was already broad daylight. He saw his car parked neatly at the door, and driver Number Zero Eight, Inoshishi, was standing outside the car waiting for him. Tsurumi had gone through a night of torment and felt like every plant and tree was an enemy soldier. He didn't want to ask Inoshishi anything. He got into the car and only said the word "station," then curled up in the car. When he arrived at the station, he told Inoshishi to go back and bought a ticket to Fukushima and then Matsushima. He arrived at his destination at around 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Tsurumi couldn't rest on the train because the events of that night were beyond his imagination: Pingzi; the Fifth Column of the General Headquarters; Aoki; Konoe; and so on. The sudden appearance of these figures, the changes in the situation, were all beyond imagination. Looking back, it was like a dream. If his nerves weren't so strong, he would have thought he had really experienced all these strange things in a dream. These things happened one after another, too quickly to cope with.</p>
<p>Matsushima was a place he often visited as a child. Before going to mainland China, he would come here for a few days every so often. In the countryside of Matsushima, there is a village called Tamura, a very remote place with a small population and extremely beautiful scenery. It is backed by mountains and faces the ocean. In a mountain village in Japan, in a house near the mountains, lived an old lady in her late sixties, Mrs. Koyuan. She was a relative of Tsurumi's adoptive mother, Meizi. After Meizi married Tsurumi Kiyoshi, they remained close. Mrs. Koyuan was a widow with only one son and one daughter, so she treated Tsurumi like her own son, even more considerate than Meizi.</p>

<h3>Fire</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>High winds are good for arson, and dark nights are good for murder. The weather is getting cold, and the northwest wind is strong. Arson is the work of robbers, but we are sleepy and afraid of the cold. If we are careless with fire, a single spark can start a prairie fire. It's too dangerous!</p>
<p>A few days ago, the arsenal in Jianghu exploded. It is said that the cause was a carelessly dropped hand grenade. However, the direct and indirect losses to both public and private entities are, frankly, incalculable. If it had happened in a bustling city, wouldn't it have been an unprecedented tragedy?</p>
<p>A tire shop owner's son turned one month old. Red candles were burning high, filling the air with joy. Unexpectedly, joy turned to sorrow. A spark from the candle touched gasoline, and in an instant, the entire shop was reduced to ashes, affecting the neighbors on both sides. Nothing is more unfortunate than this.</p>
<p>To prevent accidents, the head of the household should inspect the kitchen and stove areas every night before going to bed, carefully checking stoves, electric stoves, electric wiring, etc., to see if there is any damage. Flammable items should be stored safely. All of these things are minor and easily overlooked, but once disaster strikes, families can be ruined.</p>
<p>The end of the year is approaching. Although everyone has had a tense and uneasy year, we have managed to get through it. Who can withstand another unexpected disaster? I offer this as a reminder to everyone.</p>
<p>Fable</p>
<h3>If There is Only One Reproductive Male Left in the World</h3>
<p>— Yezi</p>
<p>[Foreword] "Free Talk" published an "Fable" a month ago, saying that an atomic bomb exploded accidentally one day, destroying the reproductive capacity of all the men in the world. Fortunately, a male worker in a mine was spared. Therefore, how to deal with this unique and reproductive male in the world became a major international event...</p>
<p>I don't usually see that article as a "fable." I think it is a "futurist" tragedy. So, I turned over many books. As a result, I know that even if such a day comes, scientists will still have ways to remedy it. Within five years, women all over the world could be "impregnated" one or two times by this "race" using artificial methods. Within ten years, every healthy woman in the world could give birth to one or two babies for this "race," even with scientists specifying that they be male. Thirty years later, the world will be filled with third-generation grandchildren born of the same father.</p>
<p>If that "race" was only twenty years old at the time of the bombing and could live healthily to seventy, he might even see a "four-generation family" under "one world." This is faster than we expect.</p>
<p>What follows is based on the assumptions of the original "Fable." "Continuing the Dog's Tail" as follows.</p>
<p>First, please forgive the reader. In the following narrative, for convenience and to save words, the pen will use some words that are common in science books but are disdained by "hypocrites."</p>
<p>Artificial insemination</p>
<p>The "Fable" hypothesizes that all men except one lucky one have lost their reproductive capacity, while all women seem to be healthy. As long as the reproductive function of that one man does not disappear and is healthy and normal, then the problem of the reproduction of the human race is not as serious as imagined. People will recover at an ultra-fast rate under the "one ancestor."</p>
<p>The first remedy is "artificial insemination." This method has long been very common in the breeding of animals and livestock. For example, for a good stud horse, livestock experts often use a relatively simple method to separate the viable reproductive cells (sperm) excreted by the horse in one go and inject them into four to more than ten female horses, allowing them to be fertilized and conceived. This stud horse and the "crowd of female horses" do not need to have any sexual behavior in contact with each other.</p>
<p>In humans, the same method is also used in medicine. For example, if it is known that the reproductive cells (sperm and eggs) of a male and female are both normal, but there is some reason that they cannot meet and be fertilized, this artificial method is also used to assist. In recent years, the technology and tools in this area have been improving day by day, so the pregnancy rate is also increasing year by year. Many people have "instant success" after one artificial assistance, and half of them "get a son"!</p>
<p>However, there is a difference between humans and animals. Because there is no need, no one has ever investigated how many women can be "artificially inseminated" with the reproductive cells excreted by one man at a time.</p>
<p>Theoretically speaking</p>
<p>Theoretically speaking, as long as one male reproductive cell meets with one female reproductive cell, it can become a "fertilized egg" and grow into a "fetus." God knows why it is so wasteful: taking a one-child-per-three-year system for one husband and one wife, the male excretes at least hundreds of millions of reproductive cells during this period. However, only a tiny, lucky male reproductive cell has the opportunity to become a "fertilized egg."</p>
<p>That "necessity is the mother of invention," and we have every reason to believe that scientists can invent "one sperm, one pregnancy," that is, 100% "artificial pregnancy" when needed. In this way, as mentioned earlier, within three to ten years, hundreds of millions of healthy women of childbearing age around the world can raise one or two babies for this male "race." This is not entirely a fantasy. Readers may worry that this "race" will be exhausted from moving back and forth between the two hemispheres and the five continents. In fact, there is no need for this, because scientists have long found a way to keep the male reproductive cells well-maintained outside the human body without reducing their activity and reproductive capacity. In addition, with the ubiquitous ultra-fast long-distance air transportation in recent years, the "dad" may be in the Arctic Ocean, but the "mom" is raising a baby for him in the equator!</p>
<p>People with "worldliness" may worry about the excessive consumption of this "race." In fact, this is also unnecessary. The replenishment of reproductive power is nothing more than the replenishment of reproductive endocrine, that is, "sex hormones." For decades, the Chinese have eaten "ox penis" and "monkey testicles" as "kidney tonics." In today's scientific medicine, there is something called "organ therapy," and there is no difference in principle and method. However, after a massive explosion of atomic energy, since all men have lost their reproductive capacity, I am afraid that the male animals at that time have also lost their male reproductive capacity. This method still does not work.</p>
<p>Fortunately, "artificial synthetic chemistry" has made great progress in recent years. "Testosterone," one of the male hormones, has been successfully manufactured by chemists in test tubes and is sold well on the market. According to the conclusions published in specialist journals, even "castrated" or "man-made castrated" people such as eunuchs can immediately restore their reproductive function with this artificial synthetic compound. There is no problem in replenishing the healthy "race"!</p>
<p>All babies are male</p>
<p>The "Fable" did not mention that female reproductive capacity has disappeared, then quickly raising a batch of male babies is an urgent task under the "population policy."</p>
<p>We know that the reason for the difference between men and women is that there are two kinds of reproductive cells in their father's reproductive cells. One kind becomes a male fetus, and the other kind becomes a female fetus.</p>
<p>According to a scientific report published by the Soviet Union last year, they have a way to use "ionization" to collect sperm under one "electrode" to produce only male babies, and the other "electrode" to produce only female babies. Although the detailed method has not been published, it seems undeniable that scientists have done this.</p>
<p>Pregnant after husband's death</p>
<p>From the above, we can infer that relying on this one "race" and using artificial methods to make every existing woman bear a boy for him within ten years, at the most conservative, it can be said that there is such a possible opportunity.</p>
<p>If he was only twenty years old when the atomic bomb exploded, then on his fiftieth birthday he will see his second generation and daughters-in-law all over the world congratulate him. He still has vigorous reproductive power at that time.</p>
<p>At seventy, his third-generation daughters-in-law congratulate him.</p>
<p>If he unfortunately dies before he is fifty, don't be afraid, because in the last years of this World War, scientists used low temperature and other special methods to preserve sperm outside the male body for five or ten years without any change, so even ten years after the "race" dies, his "sons" can continue to be born.</p>
<p>The only unfortunate thing</p>
<p>We do not know whether this "race" has any defects or bad genetic factors in his body and brain. If so, "the eternal catastrophe of mankind" will continue for a long time. Because from the third generation onwards, or even from the second generation onwards, they are all blood marriages, brothers and sisters, cousins, and cousins, and all heritable adverse factors will increase and never decline, until mankind truly sinks and perishes!</p>
<p>Therefore, I also oppose using atomic bombs to kill mankind.</p>

<h3>A Short History of Peng Xuepei</h3>
<p>— Huang Jieqing</p>
<p>With the ceasefire between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the National Congress in session, Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei has become one of the most silent figures.</p>
<p>Mr. Peng is from Anfu, Jiangxi, courtesy name Haoxu, and is only forty-eight years old. He studied at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan and lived in Japan for seven years. Later, he transferred to France and obtained a degree in economics from the University of Brussels in Belgium. He returned to China in 1925 and served as a professor at Peking University and the College of Law and Politics. His moving lectures certainly won the enthusiastic support of young students.</p>
<p>Mr. Peng entered politics in the summer of 1927, when he served as the director of education at the Kuomintang Shanghai Party Affairs Training Institute. Later, he was promoted to Vice Minister of the Interior, Vice Minister of Political Affairs of the Executive Yuan, and Vice Minister of Communications. Recently, he was appointed Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee, becoming an important figure on the political stage.</p>
<p>Mr. Peng once entered Wang Jingwei's inner circle, and the host and guest were very happy. When Wang Jingwei advocated peace, Mr. Peng's will was firm and he was not moved. Therefore, he was able to maintain his political position, and today he is even relied on by President Song as his right-hand man.</p>
<p>In December 1927, the Shanghai Central Daily News was founded, and Mr. Peng was appointed editor-in-chief. He is the author of books such as "Political Parties in Europe, America and Japan" and "Monetary Policies in China and Foreign Countries."</p>
<p>He is indeed a politician who is familiar with finance and economics.</p>
<p>Mr. Peng is not very tall. He used to have a short beard, which made him look like a sage. He shaved it off after the victory, which slightly reduced his dignity, but made him look more energetic.</p>
<p>Shanghai Cross-Section</p>
<h3>The Organization of Beggars</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>In Peking opera, there are always dragon extras. Whenever dukes, marquises, generals, and ministers appear, there are always four or more dragon extras lined up on the left and right, standing there like wooden chickens. Every major theater has its own base team, specializing in serving as these moving backdrops. However, there are many small-scale opera troupes in Shanghai, which are usually limited in their expenditures, and the number of people in the base team is very limited. When a larger number of dragon extras is needed temporarily, they can only be supplied by the old brothers in the beggar gang. Later, because the need for this kind of extra gradually increased, there were people in the gang who specialized in serving as these dragon extras. They are collectively known as "Dragon Generals."</p>
<p>Those among the beggars who serve as these semi-permanent dragon extras are mostly neat in appearance and have in fact broken away from the original appearance of the beggars. These are the long-grown beggars who specialize in this, and the little ghosts are not qualified to be selected due to their age. Whenever a theater has its own base team, it is enough to supply the few dragon generals needed on weekdays. But if a new play is being rehearsed and five or six dragon generals are needed, and the base team is only enough for three, they have to ask the old brothers to disassemble the bowls and dishes. Although the time that the dragon extras appear on stage each time is not very prominent, because Wei, Shu, and Wu were originally opposed, Cao Cao's dragon extras cannot appear in Zhao Yun's hall, for fear that the audience will recognize them and ruin the plot of the play. Now that there are ready-made dragon generals that can be hired, and they are paid on a daily basis, the theater is naturally happy to hire them. Those who do this do not need any skills, but there are certain routes and regulations for entering and exiting the stage. A single step of difference will make you embarrassed on the spot, and the audience will never tolerate it. The Dragon Generals have a lot of experience in this, and outsiders naturally dare not steal this job.</p>
<p>Dragon Generals are at least four people in a group, and there are also first, second, and third classes among the four people. The person leading the way in and out is the first class, because their actions must advance and retreat according to the joints of the plot, which is very important, so the salary is higher than the other three.</p>
<p>In addition to the Dragon Generals, there is also a kind of person who plays wealthy women, usually these Dragon Generals in drag. But only those with a neat and well-proportioned body can serve. This is considered rare in the gang, and the reward is more than double that of male dragon extras. If there is an opportunity to serve as a member of the Ling class, they will also not tire of gathering here, because their livelihood can be solved. After a year and a half, no one would have imagined that those ancient costume maids on the stage with beautiful eyes were originally wandering children sleeping in buckets and fighting for food!</p>
<p>Before the war, Shanghai was extremely prosperous in the private opera performances. If wealthy or well-to-do families had happy events, they would always invite amateur opera singers or small opera troupes to perform. The dragon generals and palace maids that were needed were often not available for loan from the theater, so they had to ask the wholesale department of these wild dragon generals. The rewards for private performances are more generous than those in the theater. In addition to eating and drinking, they can also ask for auspicious gifts. In addition, if they can follow famous actors to perform opera in other ports, the income is even more considerable. Everyone in the industry regards it as a lucrative business. They all spare no effort in seeking activities, hoping to get the opportunity to run the wharf!</p>

<h3>Dead People Care Most About Face</h3>
<p>— Shigu</p>
<p>The winter relief committee is raising donations. It is said that the results of the two days are not as good as those of the Pushan Villa. Some people say: "Shanghai people like to ask dead people to do things," and others say: "Because dead people care most about face"!</p>
<h3>Unity</h3>
<p>— Shigu</p>
<p>It is said that the unity of the Chinese people can be demonstrated on the road:</p>
<p>When a jeep runs over and kills someone, in less than a minute, the scene of the accident is immediately united. Although the unity is strong, everyone has the mentality of watching the excitement. They don't ask or hear anything. After the matter is over, everyone scatters in a rush, so this sentence of "five minutes" seems to be correct?</p>
<h3>With Joy and Fear</h3>
<p>— Nanming</p>
<p>The number of purchasers of luxury goods in companies and stores has decreased. Some say this is a manifestation of the people's noble frugality, while others say it is a harbinger of the collapse of the social economy. Both statements make sense, so it is: one with joy, one with fear!</p>
<h3>Shanghai's "Shangri-La"</h3>
<p>— Gui</p>
<p>Standing next to the east side of the Dahua Theater on Nanjing West Road, there is a red Western-style building with a history of more than ten years, occupying more than two acres. Although many people pass by all day and all night, few people know the equipment and organization inside. This house was first built by Jewish people and housed the Jewish General Association. Later, the Jewish General Association moved to the intersection of Moore Road and Zhongzheng Middle Road. The place was rented to the Shanghai Race Club, and then rented to the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment by the Race Club. Then came the Pacific War. The Marine Regiment had already withdrawn, and the Japanese Army occupied it, setting up the Army Department and the Propaganda Department there. After the victory, the National Army temporarily occupied it for a while, and then it was changed to the current U.S. Navy Club.</p>
<p>The internal organization of the club is managed by the Navy, which manages everything inside and outside. Although the people entering and leaving the club are generally soldiers, Admiral Kirk also comes often. The last time U.S. Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal came to Shanghai, he hurriedly made a tour with Admiral Kirk after the banquet hosted by Mayor Wu at ten o'clock. Regardless of the size of the official position, the enjoyment inside is the same for everyone, without distinction. The Western food served is limited in price, and the limited price is enforced by the Navy. For example, steak, pork chops, iron-grilled chicken, etc. are only 2,000 yuan in legal tender per dish. The price of coffee is the same as that sold by street vendors on the road. The rest, such as beer, Coca-Cola, and cigarettes, are allocated by the military. Because of the tax-free price advantage, stores cannot compete with it, thus affecting the bars outside, which are closing one by one. On the day of July 4th, which is the American Memorial Day, whiskey, sandwiches, Coca-Cola, etc. in the club were supplied free of charge as much as possible, which really made people admire their meticulous care for the soldiers.</p>
<p>Dancing is one of the most popular entertainments for Americans. The dance floor is set up on the second floor, and the size of the dance floor is the same as that of the MGM. The band is hired from Shanghai. The band is now playing by black people's bands, but sometimes it is performed by bands formed by the Navy and Marine Corps. It is mostly on Saturdays and holidays. Pan Yuzhen's performance is also indispensable. The partners brought by the soldiers are mostly Russians and Chinese. The ones with the most complicated status are the Chinese, including Jeep girls, socialites, dancers, salty water girls, students, and writing office staff. What is most regrettable is the general students and nurses who have received higher education. They are unwilling to show their faces in front of the Chinese people, so as not to see acquaintances. The general salty water girls are the most funny. Their names are all called Lolita, Lillian, etc. The English they speak is so good that people can't believe they are in this industry. As for those who can't speak, they gesticulate, which is too numerous to list.</p>
<p>The films are shown by the soldiers themselves, two shows a day, at 4:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. The films they showed a long time ago have almost not been released in the theaters yet. The most famous one is "One Night in Paradise," starring Manuel Aubran, which is a full-color mythological film. They showed it this year in June. The other films are the latest, and the films are changed every two days.</p>
<p>There are also other entertainment such as chess rooms, libraries, and table tennis rooms. The enjoyment of the soldiers is unmatched even by the so-called high-class Chinese. One sighs!</p>
<h3>Big Sale</h3>
<p>Recalling before the victory, there was a shortage of materials, imported goods were cut off, and prices were rising sharply due to the manipulation of speculators. At that time, stores simply didn't want to do business. As for holding a big sale, it was almost foolish. But now the momentum of the big sale is so high, and the banner of the big sale is everywhere.</p>
<p>Everywhere on the street are stores that are promoting big sales. The radio is broadcasting incessantly all day long, or hiring simple bands, playing vulgar music, hanging lanterns and decorations, and colorful. The scene of this lively prosperity is really beyond description. Another way of holding a big sale is to close all the rows of doors, leaving only a small door for entry and exit. Outside the door are posted eye-catching and stimulating slogans such as "Closing Down Sale," which is really unique! Newspapers are also full of huge advertisements for big sales, but these are not easy to move people's hearts!</p>
<p>The big sales of stores are rarely for the sake of "treating customers well." In fact, they all have great difficulties. Recently, the fluctuations in prices have not been great, and high interest rates are rampant. Merchants are naturally unwilling to keep their goods for a long time while paying interest. They all deeply understand that now is not the time to hoard and speculate. Only by selling goods early and turning over flexibly can they make money. Moreover, the end of the year is approaching, and everyone should have an end to the debts, and the expenses for their own New Year should also be settled. Under these circumstances, the big sale, which is like a raging fire and seems crazy, is held comprehensively.</p>
<p>But for several years, people's lives have been tortured and exhausted, and purchasing power is generally low. What is the use of a big sale?</p>
<p>The big sale is lively, but on careful thought, you want to cry! (To be continued) We solicit the following:</p>

<h3>Cockfighting in America</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>If we say that cockfighting is a movement, then its nature is the same as horse racing—a gambling sport.</p>
<p>Cockfighting was popular in the United States very early. Former presidents Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln were all "cockfighting enthusiasts." Later, various states, considering cockfighting to be a waste of money and manpower, enacted laws to ban it. Currently, except for Florida, which does not ban non-gambling cockfighting, all other states ban cockfighting itself.</p>
<p>Despite this, from Maine in the north to Florida in the south, and from New York in the east to Wyoming in the west, there are still hundreds of cockfighting finals every year. Large-scale competitions and championships are held in secret. Millions of US dollars in bets are exchanged between owners. Thousands of carefully bred fighting cocks fight to the death every day. Tens of thousands of entertainment tax dollars become the "hosting fees" for the "uncle class" organizers of cockfights.</p>
<p>Because cockfighting is illegal, the venues are all in remote places, and the times are all at night. Below is a "route slip" that the host notified gamblers to find the cockfighting arena for a certain cockfight:</p>
<p>"Drive south along US Highway 60006, pass Blackwell by two miles, then leave the highway and proceed right along the gravel road. After proceeding six and a quarter miles along the gravel road, pass a bridge; after passing the bridge, turn left into the second dirt road, and the third alley on the right side of the dirt road will lead directly to the cockfighting arena."</p>
<p>The cockfighting arena is guarded all around. Entering the arena requires paying an entrance fee of about five dollars, plus a tenth of the "entertainment tax." The cockfighting arena is usually built inside existing large stables or granaries, with the doors tightly closed to prevent lights and shouts from being revealed. The internal atmosphere is as tense as a boxing ring, and the cockfighting arena is illuminated by a 1,000-candlepower mercury lamp.</p>
<p>The weapons of the fighting cocks, in addition to their natural sharp beaks and sharp spurs, are that the cock owner also installs a one-and-a-half-inch-long steel hook on their spurs, which is as sharp as a needle. The steel hook is nailed to a piece of leather. This piece of leather is wrapped around the chicken's leg, and then tightly tied with thread. The feathers of the fighting cock's tail and wings are also trimmed.</p>
<p>Before the cockfight, gamblers freely look for people with opposing opinions to bet with, and they can bet at any time during the cockfight. - The most active among them are of course the cock owners with the strongest confidence.</p>
<p>Before the cockfight begins, the two cock owners each hold their own chicken, making them peck at each other with their beaks to arouse their fighting spirit. Then, like the start of a boxing match, they retreat to a corner, and wait for the referee to give an order, then release the chickens, and let them gather in the center of the ring to fight with all their strength.</p>
<p>The process of cockfighting is indeed stimulating enough, but you can see four feet leaping, feathers spreading, and the movements are so fast that you can't take care of it all. But it is also cruel enough. Where the steel hook starts, blood is dripping. Sometimes it hooks the eye, and even the eyeball will be hooked out.</p>
<p>During the fighting process, if one of the chickens is injured and falls to the ground, just like in a boxing match, the referee can order a temporary suspension of the fight, and the cock owner will help the chicken up and use various methods to restore the injured chicken's fighting ability. At this time, the referee counts one, two, three..., and when he counts to twenty (large fifteen-second bell), if the fallen chicken cannot "return to the workplace", it is considered to have lost.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a "Cockfighting Championship", which is not about betting, but about winning the grand prize. Each cock owner brings a few fighting cocks (usually four to eight) to participate, and each person pays a certain amount of participation fee, which is collected as a bonus. The first prize amount ranges from twenty-five yuan to one thousand yuan, sometimes more.</p>
<p>After the participation fees are collected, the weights of the fighting cocks are measured, and the weights of each pair of fighters must be nearly equal - this concept is also derived from boxing matches. In addition to the championship, there is also a "Grand Championship", which is a combination of several small championships held together. Ordinary championships have no small prizes in addition to the first prize, while grand championships often have a second prize, and sometimes a third prize is added. For example, in a Grand Championship held by combining ten one-thousand-yuan prize championships, the prize money of this ten thousand yuan is usually distributed as follows: first prize six thousand yuan, second prize three thousand yuan, and third prize one thousand yuan.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Gambling is a weakness of human nature. If the mentality of luck cannot be thoroughly eliminated, underground gambling cannot be completely prohibited by law.</p>
