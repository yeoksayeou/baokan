<h3>對華救濟物資停運令　聯總宣布部分解禁　美工潮解決後船隻即開華</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕聯總署賴伽第亞今日宣佈：聯總運華救濟物資，部份解禁。賴氏稱：中國口岸能應付救濟物資者，於要求此項物資時，即可運往。賴氏佈吿稱：「中國口岸物資分配之速度已大見增進……特將對華物資禁運予以停止，準許依照中國口岸之容量，於各該口岸請求時將物資運出」。賴氏謂：一俟目前工潮解決時，船隻即可開出。並稱：關於中國口岸物資分配速度改進之報吿，係得自聯總中國分署署長艾格頓少將。該佈吿文長僅七十三字，並未說明詳細計劃。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕行總發言人頃就聯總署長賴伽第亞宣佈部份取消對華物資停運令事發表談話稱：此次聯總宣佈部份取消停運令，係數月來木署不斷努力出淸物資之結果。就目前本署物資分配情形而論，聯總實有立即全部恢復對華物資運輸之必要，否則恐難與今後本署之工作相配合。又謂：自本年七月間聯總宣佈停運令以來，本署每月分配各地物資數量均有顯著之增加，七月份本署運往外埠物資爲四五。〇〇〇噸，八月份增至六八·〇〇〇噸，九月份九六·〇〇〇噸，連在滬分配物資合計共達一二〇·〇〇〇噸。本署分配物資不斷增加，而聯總運輸反見遲緩，以十月五日至十一日最近一週而論，本署在涎分配及運往外埠之物資共計二一·九五八噸，同一星期內在滬起卸之聯總物資不過一四·六八三〇噸。目前上海倉庫尙存物資一一五·〇〇〇噸，其中六五·〇〇〇噸須在滬加工改製，是以可運往外埠分配之物資僅餘五·〇〇〇〇噸，加上今後兩月內聯總預定運華之五〇·〇〇〇噸，總計亦不過十萬噸。而在同一期間內，本署運輸量可達二四〇·〇〇〇噸。本人曾以聯總恢復運輸請敎專家，咸謂：即使聯總立即實行全部恢復運輸，亦須待三個月之久，始能見效果云。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕據華社東訊：最近有聯總巨輪廿八艘，滿戰物資駛運來滬，日內即可到達。</p>
<h3>聯總對華救濟計劃　英共黨議員在下院提詢問</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦〕二十一日電〕工黨議員威廉斯，在下院詢問：聯總停止活動後，中國救濟工作計劃如何？此項工作將由何一機構繼任？聯總在華工作之經騐，將予以如何之考慮？俾使已往錯誤不致重演。外次麥克尼爾答稱：聯總在華計劃，大的在一九四七年秋季以前不致完成，八月間，聯總在日內瓦召開之大會，已通過決議，將聯總停止工作後各國是否仍需救濟之問題，交聯合國大會討論，故聯大當決定如何處理救濟工作，在決定之先，應先審査，除由國際銀行貸給款項外，各該國是否尙需外界援助，此一問題，與各國對外支付平衡之問題有關，不能預先作精確之估計，亦不在聯總之善後救濟範圍以內。至於聯總所得經騐，自當供給任何在華担任救濟工作之機關。聞聯總已設專員，祥記在華活動之經過，此將爲極有價値之記錄云。</p>

<h3>祝聯合國大會成功</h3>
<p>聯合國大會今天在紐約開幕了。全世界五十一國的政治外交家聚首於一堂，又將開始討論如何締造世界和平的艱鉅工作了。全世界人類的視綫都集中在紐約，密切注視着這個國際會議的發展。一般觀察家對於聯合國大會的前途，雖仍多抱着悲觀的看法；但在今日各國人民，企求世界和平的願望，實在太迫切了，只要有一綫希望，終覺得會有豁然開朗的可能，決不表示絕望。各國人民對於聯合國大會的成功，仍抱着無限的期望，所以美國國務副卿艾契遜在聯合國大會前夕，致詞歡迎各國代表，也很率直坦白地說：『美國已以擁護聯合國爲其一貫的外交政策；今後且將勇往直前，賡續採取此項政策而不稍餒。美國政府深信聯合國必能在艱難之長途中，充分進步，而完成世界和平。」這雖是美國外交家口頭的應酬詞令，但足以增强各國代表對於聯合國大會必能成功的信心。</p>
<p>今日世界政局的重心，無疑的，完全在美蘇關係上。聯合國大會成敗的關鍵，亦即在此，甫自巴黎返國的美國國務卿貝爾納斯，向國人報吿二十一國和會的經過情形時宣稱：「目下局勢最可憂慮的地方，乃在美蘇兩國的緊張局勢有增無减，美國對蘇讓步，已至山窮水盡的地步。「但是蘇聯外長莫洛托夫行抵紐約後，就向美國報界發表談話稱：「余相信眞誠與好意，必能達到互相諒解；因此亦相信此次聯合國大會所而臨的工作，必能完成，任何困難，均能迎刃而解。蘇聯代表團對於此次聯合國大會及在下月初旬舉行之外長會議，必能有所貢獻，俾使其完成工作，以增進和平利益及全世界大小各國人民的福利。」這雖然是外交家的應酬談吐，但也足以使世人對於美蘇關係行將好轉的希望，益趨濃厚。所以我們在聯合國大會開幕的前夕，看到紐約充滿了一片祥和光明的景象，實在令人快　，但願世界局勢從此開朗，勿使渴望和平的世人再空歡喜一塲。</p>
<p>我們旣處在這種國際氛圍中，自然也應以愉快的心情的來歡迎聯合國大會的開幕，並以至誠祝聯合國大會的成功，但是緬懷過去，瞻望將來，把目前的國際局勢，作一個全面的分析，終覺得聯合國大會的前途，未容過分樂觀，仍有待各國大智大仁的政治家去努力，排解萬難，而爲世界和平開闢一條康莊大道，茲就所見，願向各國政治外交家進一言。</p>
<p>第一，我們回憶一年半來的國際局勢，只見波瀾迭起，而幾個基本問題，兜了一個大圈子，仍回到了原來的出發點，絲亳沒有獲得解決。這實在是戰後最令人氣短的現象。以歐洲言，自納粹德國無條件投降戰事結束以來，已歷一年有半；即以遠東而論，自日本屈膝乞降至今，也已有一年餘。其間雖有許多政治外交家，竭智盡能，在那裏致力和平，但是眞正的和平，至今還沒有光臨人間，在國際上，由五國外長會而三國外長會議，由聯合國大會而四國外長會議，再由四國外長會議而巴黎會議，現今又將由聯合國大會而四國外長會議了。國際會議之多，在人類歷史土創了一個空前的紀錄，但是這些國際會議的結果如何？我們且作一總淸算，唯一的成就，只有巴黎和會所通過的五部和的軍案而已。其他重要問題，由外長會議討論解決不了，乃移交巴黎和會處理，而巴黎和會仍未能獲致解決，而今又退回外長會議討論了。這抓殘酷的事實，給我們一個珍貴的敎訓，就是締造和平，實非易事，而需要各國的通力合作，始有成功希望。</p>
<p>第二，我們研究和平工作進展遲緩的原因，不能不歸咎於列強不能開誠相見，以致互相猜忌，疑竇叢生，乃造成兩個世界對立的局勢，其實在事實上，蘇聯固然需要和平，不願再見戰爭；此在美國亦需要和平，並痛惡戰爭；雙方的目的既然相同，何以在國際會議中不能合作呢？這顯然是由於雙方互相疑忌所致。中國有句俗話。所謂「不誠無物」，美蘇既不能以誠相見，任何問題，自不能解決。反之，雙方如能開誠布公，無事不可商議，則任何困難，均不難迎刃而解；所謂「誠之所至金石爲開」。莫洛托夫外長在紐約發表談話，亦以此爲言，使我們相信，各國代表尤其是美蘇代表，在這次聯合國大會中，必能以誠相見，捐棄一切意見上的紛歧，而獲致完全一致的協議。</p>
<p>第三，因爲我們盼望聯合國大會能够成功，故不能不指出聯合國機構的缺陷，質言之，就是在它的組織上缺少民主精神。戰後世界旣已步入和平民主的新時代，目前當可視爲民主世紀。世界各國人民不僅要求國內政治的民主化，而且也要求國際政治的民主化。强權政治已是歷史上的陳蹟，決不容許其復活，再度出現於民主世紀的國際舞台上。我們把聯合國憲章仔細加以硏究一番，就可以知道，今日開幕的聯合國大會的機構，有着非常不民主主地方。在它的理論上，聯合國各國，不論大小，不分强弱，在法律上一視同仁完全平等的。但是在安全理事會中，一則有常任理事國與非常任理事國之分，再則常任理事國對於安全理事會所通渦之決議案有行使否決權的特權。凡爲各國所贊成的決議，只要有一個强國（常任理事）表示異議，就不能成立，這是何等不民主的制度！所以我們要盼望聯合國大會能夠成功，並要它成爲維持世界和平的唯一有效工具，則非把否決權撤銷不可。美國國內早已有這種運動的發起，並向世界各國倡導，各國也莫不表示贊成，所表示反對的，唯有蘇聯一國而已。在美蘇關係未改善之前，蘇聯獨持異議，站在蘇聯的立場，固然也有其理由；但至各國以誠相見，各國不復有疑懼之後，蘇聯自然更沒有堅持的理由，使聯合國機構依舊保留着它的致命傷。</p>
<p>要之，這次聯合國大會所討論的問題，除了現行國際爭議而外，並將討論有益於人類福利的各項問題。對於整個人類的前途，均有極密切的關係。所以爲各國利益計，同時也爲世界前途計，這次會議是只許成功而不許失敗的。我們且在這裏，遙祝聯合國大會成功。</p>

<p>七路汽車希望延長</p>
<p>七路公共汽車，已於雙十節通車了。我們虹口的住民，確實得到不少的便利。但是起點在吳淞路口百老匯大厦，因爲沒有電車與公共汽車銜接，我們仍然覺得美中不足。我們大多數的虹口住民，均希望七路公共汽車，再由百老匯大厦，沿蘇州河向西延長到四川路橋。如此過了橋就有十七路無軌常車與二路公共汽車可以搭乘到中區，在交通事業當局旣沒有多大的損失，或者因爲有車銜接，乘客必多而增加收入，但我們得到的便利確實不少，希望當局重加考慮，允予所請。（程全祿）</p>

<p>〔聯合社新德里廿一日電〕甘地今日在此談稱：孟加拉省回盟人數甚多，應有控制該省之力。余定於下星期赴孟加拉視察，慰問受難者。甘地並稱：「英國勢力倘能撤退，騷擾結束將更快，英國勢力若長此存在，則印回雙方均盼英國力量爲援助，余不得不承認此點。」甘地對新任回盟閣員艾里所謂回盟之參加臨時政府僅在促進回敎分治主張一說，加以批駁，謂此種態度，奇怪而矛盾。臨時政府之成立，乃在處理全國一般問題，如飢寒。疾病。交通不善，與文盲諸問題，此種問題無分印回敎徒云。</p>

<h3>聯國機構大會　重要議題槪覽</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處紐約廿一日電〕聯合國大會議程內之五十三項目，多爲爭取和平世界與富有永久性趣味之問題。首决聯合國大會去冬在倫敦舉行，此决五十一國代表將面臨各種重要問題，諸如設立聯合國託管委會，安理會否決權及各會員國之問題等等。聯合國秘書長賴依昨在聯合國特別節目中播講，强調大會行動之重要性，謂大會爲「聯合國組織</p>
<p>決策之一環，」並籲請各方注意，謂大會除安理會已考慮之問題外，實能考席聯合國　章範圍內之一切問題。考慮各項問題之時間表，規定大會將舉行全會四日，其後各委會即應展開工作，旋再舉行全會，討論各委會之工作進展。星期三之開幕式，及其後之全會，均將在紐約近郊麥克多斯公園舉行；委會會議則將在聯合國臨時所在地成功湖舉行，大會可望於六星期半〔或十二月七日〕後閉幕。在此期間，大會將舉行</p>
<p>四五〇次議，其中約有三十至卅五次爲全會，九十次爲主要委會會議，其餘各次則將爲其他各小組委會會議。預料大會工作百分之七十均將在成功湖完成。全會及委會會議均定於週一至週五上下午及週六上午舉行，星期日將無會議。大會計有六主要委會，或稱爲全體委會，蓋每一委會中均</p>
<p>有五十一國之代表在也。全體委會計爲：政治安全·經濟金融·社會人文及文化·託管·行政預算及法律委會。各委會亦設一十四人指導委員，由主席一人，副主席七人及六主要委會主席共同組成。大會當前首要問題之一，爲附屬區之託管問題，預料聯合國託管委員會將吿成立。迄今爲止，法國已提出關於法屬吐谷蘭與非洲法屬喀麥隆之協定二件。英·比·澳與紐西蘭亦己報吿託管栛定之計劃，而南非聯邦則提議請求准許合併西南非洲之代管領土。聯合國憲章並不規定，</p>
<p>託管委員會會員國之數量，但該委員會必須包括管理託管領土之各國，（五大國之任何一國並不包括在該集國內）另加其他必要之臨時會員國，務使管理託管領土之國家與不管理託管領土之國家數量相等。大會並將決定容納聯合國新會員國之問題。如果遵照安理會之建議，則聯合國機構將因阿富汗。冰島與瑞典之加入，而增多至五十四國；但安理會拒絕保舉阿爾巴尼亞·南愛爾蘭·蒙古人民共和國，葡萄牙與外的以等國，此等國家</p>
<p>加入聯合國之問題，可能提交大會討論，例如澳洲所主張：關於新會員國，應由大會採取第一步行動。預料大會早期辯論問題之一，亦將爲安理會之全部報吿，包括伊朗·希臘·印度西尼亞。叙利亞與黎巴嫩，及弗朗哥西班牙等問題之記錄。大會尙須選舉安理會之非永久會員國，其任期爲二年，以替代荷蘭，埃及與墨西哥。退休之會員國不得立即重選。經濟社會理事會由十八國代表組織，此次大會亦應選出代表，任期三年。</p>
<p>退休之代表爲哥倫比亞·希臘·黎巴嫩·烏克蘭·美國及南斯拉夫。惟在安理會中退休之代表得重選連任。若干政治及安全問題亦亟待大會考慮。澳洲及古巴均提出安理會五常任理事國否決權問題。澳洲一向反對否決權，建議硏討憲章中有關安理會票決方法之規定。古巴則提出兩項建議，其一爲召開大會，廢除否決權，一爲召開人會修訂　章。大會亦將討論</p>
<p>印度聲訴案及蘇聯要求各國報吿其非敵國駐軍情形之建議案。按印度曾提出聲訴，謂南非虐待印僑；蘇聯要求報吿駐軍情形之建議案，則經安理會拒絕列入議程。有關世界各地人民日常生活福利之問題，大會亦將加以考慮；其中包括重建歐洲，中東，非洲及遠東被摧毀地區之建議，及遣送或處置流亡人士及難民之問題。新國際難民組織憲章及其首决五年預算草案，亦經提交聯國大會。大會並將接獲若干有關</p>
<p>國際糧食情形之報告書，內包括糧食農業組織最近會議之報吿書。大會並將應請批准建議案，採取步驟，以完成前國聯未了之國際管制麻醉品工作，此項建議案曾拒絕西班牙政府加入聯合國麻醉品管制機構。此外，聯合國與下列各機關之協定亦須待大會核准：國際勞工機構，聯合國敎育科學文化機構，糧食農業機構，及臨時國際民用航空機構。各代表並將考慮步驟，加速世界衛生機構之設立，並設立國際</p>
<p>兒童緊急基金聯總署若干福利活動之開始，亦將提出討論。巴拿馬去冬向大會第一次會議所提有關人權與自由之宣言草案，當時爲時間所限，今後將採取行動。最後大會，各代表將考應聯合國之財政，一九四六年與一九四七年之頸算。本年度頸算將不到二千萬美元；一九四七年之預算將略增。會員國分担聯合國費用之問題亦將付諸討論。</p>

<p>本市婦女團體招待方主委呂中委等茶會中方主委致詞（中國社攝）</p>
<h3>電上海一靈魂！　上海繁榮的基礎是工業工業發展寄託在電力上</h3>
<p>上海工業化的程度，在用電的數字上可以明顯的表現出來。全市的發電總量是十三萬瓩，家用的比率僅佔三分之一，工業用電佔三分之二。而在工業用電之中紗廠消耗了四萬二千瓦，佔去了一半的數量。據趙曾釭局長的推算，戰前紗廠的工作效率比較高，生產每包紗所需的電量是二百度至二百五十度；現在紗廠的效率還沒有完全復原，每包紗的生產，需要三百度的電力。除了紗廠之外，其他各種工業，消耗了本市三分之一的電。從公用局的統計數字看，其餘各工業用電量的次序是：（一）織布業，（二）麵粉業，（三）造紙業，（四）冷藏業，（五）橡膠業，（六）機器業，（七）毛織業，（八）烟草業，（九）綢廠，（十）製油業。公用局有一個供電審査的機構，審査各個工業對於民生的需要性，而決定它們供電的優先程序。目前紗布的產的需要最迫切，所以今後紗廠業用電的數量還要提高。</p>
<p>電廠負擔過重</p>
<p>電力是工業之母。目前上海工業的生產力，所以不能發揮到最高度，電力不足是最主要的原因。現在上海的電廠已經負擔過重，這是一個病像。公用局趙局長在後方工廠復員協會的聚餐會上，具體的說明了這個情形。他說：本市電廠的服務時間，是世界第一；以服務係數而諭，在百分之八十以上。這就是說：電力廠的機器，在一百小時之內，有八十小時以上在工作着！另外一件事實是「過份負擔」。因爲全部的發電量是十三萬瓩，而上海市的用電量，每日夜有兩個時候，高到十五萬瓩。所以今後限制用電是必要的。</p>
<p>增加生產四法</p>
<p>至於今後的電力管制政策，公用局提出了兩句口號：「節省浪費，增加生產」。取消霓虹燈，限制廣吿燈，家庭用電打七折的計劃，都是根據節省浪費的原則而訂定的。至於在增加生產方面，公用局亦有幾個努力的方向。第一條路是在善後救濟總署方面。行總有五隻發電二千瓩的發電機，局方希望有三隻用在上海，解決本市電力的饑荒。行總答允留兩隻，局方正在繼續努力。這面的努力，可以每月增加四千至六千瓩的動力。其次，上海電力公司到明年春天，發電量亦可大增。在敵僞時期內，日本人曾作改造的努力，結果是弄壞了機件，發電量反因之減低。接收以後，公司從美國請來工程師，澈底加以修理和改進。原定十月可以完工的，因爲修理澈底之故，到明年一月方可發電。有一隻重要機器送到美國去修，湊巧趕上美國的大罷工，本定年底完工的，須延遲到明年二月方能運回發電。這都是出乎當局意料之外的，不過希望不會落空，因爲明年二月起，本市可多得三萬七千瓩的電力。第三條路在浦東區，那裏有一家英商蠶絲廠，戰前有發電二千瓩的設備，戰時被日人拆至某地，現在已在搬　。這家工廠自身用電僅八百瓩，所以發電機運　以後，尙有餘電供應浦東區的工業。第四，在閘北方面，現在發電量是四千八百瓩，機器修理之後，可以增高到七千瓩。因爲有這四方面的開源，公用局長很有信心的對後方復員廠家說：到明年春天，本市電荒將大有起色。</p>
<p>軍艦幫助發電</p>
<p>有一件事可以說明公用局對電荒問題之煞費苦心。他們作最大的努力，亦準備着最壞的情勢。萬一本市電荒到沒有辦法時，公用局希望借用黃浦江中美國軍艦的電力。他們的一隻旗艦，大概可以發電四千瓩以上，自用之外，尙可多餘二千瓩。當然這個問題是不簡單的，一隻美國軍艦供應中國城市的用電，這件本司令作不得主，決定權是在美國海軍部。以發電量而論，一隻大軍艦是有力負擔一個都市的需要的。一位留美的海軍軍官對我說：羅斯福號航艦和密蘇里號主力艦的發電量，均數倍於上海的用電量。</p>
<p>電費考慮加價</p>
<p>從公用局長的中中，證實了電費行將加價的傳說。他說：過去的電價規定，是小戶用電五十元一度，大戶七十三元一度，工業用電八十四元一度。事實上，這是虧本生意。公用煤的成本原來是三萬元一噸，現在是八萬元一噸。對於紗廠，公用局特定出「以煤易電」的辦法，折合是每度電費二百元；將這裏的贏餘，補貼供給其他工業的虧損。這不是持久的辦法。以電廠的原料而論，煤與柴油是並用的。自從外匯率調整之後，油價大漲，電的成本亦隨之而高。上海電力公司所用的油，直接自美國運來，成本甚高。目前他們之不即漲價，還是公用局洽商的結果。綜言之，電價的提高是必要的；但提高多少，方屬合理，則尙待硏究。客觀的說，自平民福利言，電費愈低廉愈好；但在今日上海的情形言，電力過廉，家庭間的浪費亦多。</p>
<p>有一部份工業家對於煤的成本問題，深切注意。他們認爲今日香港電價之低廉，是當地電廠使用安南鴻基煤之故。他們主張放寬煤斤統制的尺度，允許越煤來華，成本必然減輕。又一種主張是要發掘本市潛在的電力。例如現在的大紗廠和麵粉廠，本身均有發電設備，但是因爲使用公家的電力來得便宜，因之自備的發電機業而不用。從全市的觀點看，這是可觀的損失，特別在今日的上海，多一度電等於多一分生產。</p>
<p>上海前途樂觀</p>
<p>上海是個工商業大都市，而上海繁榮的基礎，是建築在工業上面。趙局長對上海的前途，作了一個樂觀的展望。他說廿五年之後，上海將是一個擁有七百萬人的世界大都市，不止是中國的「窗戶」。在現有工業區之外，應該再有四個新工業區城——閘北·南市·市中心區·浦東區。現代化的港口將建築在日暉港吳淞口一帶。這操一個工業大都市的美麗遠景，是建立在長江三角洲的形勢上；目光看得更遠一點，是寄托在三峽水力發電的大工程上！上海是中國的神經中樞，而「電」是上海的靈魂！</p>

<p>方主委詞</p>
<p>媂婦運發揮力量</p>
<p>繼山方主任委員致詞，略謂：婦女運動在社會運動中，最爲重要，今後建國成功，我們婦運工作，要發揮最大的力量，希望中層女同志團結起來，努力力求解放，更希望拿出正確的思想，黨淘自己的丈夫，有正當的思想，才有正當的出路。繼由謝　記長致詞，略謂：尊重女　，是文明進步的國家特點，中國是進步的，今後婦女運動，應該職業化，政治化，要自由，要民主，努力發展事業。末由主席錢劍秋致謝詞後，賓主盡歡，至五時許始散。</p>

<h3>何玉相身殉國難六年前舊事重提　前萬國商團白俄團丁槍殺孤軍案審結　班長陳述目睹開槍情形律師辯稱殺人不能證實</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自俄團丁槍殺孤軍案，昨日下午三時，地院再度開庭審訊，並傅到證人依凡諸夫（前萬國商團白俄隊少校團長）及前四行孤軍中士班長石洪謨，推事吳榮林，檢察官方正，及書記官謝寅生升座後，先詢被吿米奇亞可夫，當民國二十九年九十八日時，孤軍營旁，共有多少崗位，米答：平時僅七崗，因當時局勢堅張，故增加爲十三崗。案發那天，第七崗拉希台維夫亦曾開槍一響，何玉相由何人所發槍彈致死，則不得而知。</p>
<p>白俄團長呈紀事簿</p>
<p>審判長繼訊證人依凡諾夫，據其陳述，當時白俄隊擔任守衛孤軍營者共有三百二十人，民國二十九年「九一八」，本人並不在塲，且彼時並不負責白俄隊，案發後僅從報吿上得悉，米奇亞可夫於上午十二時四十五分開一槍，隔三十秒鐘後，第七崗拉希台維夫亦曾開一槍，且方向相同。依凡諾夫並將當時白俄隊「每日紀事簿」，呈庭作證，以供參考。</p>
<p>砰然一響應聲倒地</p>
<p>孤軍方面證人石洪謨班長供述案情甚詳，略謂：案發前四天已發生不幸事件，白俄施用催淚彈及自來水龍頭，向孤軍攻擊，孤軍盡屬徒手，前後死傷第兄五人，各人姓名因年久不能記憶。此案發生之日爲「九一八」，一早即有民衆來孤軍營慰問，因道白俄隊封鎖，不能入內，至十一時許越聚越多，本人（石洪謨自稱）奉謝團長之命，至門口探視，與被害人何玉相並肩立於一長凳上，向牆外窺視，被吿米奇亞可夫値第一崗，舉槍先後瞄準三次，初二次皆未發射，第三次瞄準約有一分鐘，砰然一槍，何玉相竟應聲倒地。此彈貫穿何玉相頭部，後又擎傷另一士兵高廣雲腿部，因高站立於何玉相後之洗臉木架上，地位極高，故何玉相之死，實由米奇亞可夫槍彈所致。第七崗雖亦開槍，然未傷人。吳推事依證人之言，再詢米奇亞可夫；米否認曾　準三次，並稱一槍傷二人亦不可能·證人具結後，審判長宣佈開始辯論，首由檢察官起立稱；米奇亞可夫槍殺何玉相經過事實，業經證人證明，米奇亞可夫亦已自認開槍，故宜處以殺人罪。</p>
<p>律師解釋當時環境</p>
<p>被告辯護律師劉劍剛起立，首先說明當時之環境，略謂當時日軍逞威上海四郊，屢向租界工部局交涉，接管孤軍，工部局派白俄隊戒備孤軍營，雖明爲看守，實暗中保護。本人會詢諸當時租界工部局主持人樊克令，承吿：當年九月十四日因孤軍未得允許，扯昇國旗，經英駐軍限其三小時下旗，孤軍並不實行，白俄隊奉命施放催淚彈，及用自來水噴射，驅散孤軍，將國旗降下，因此曾造成嚴重事件，及緊張空氣。「九一八」那天，又有羣衆塵集孤軍營四週，米奇亞可夫之第一崗尤衆，米於包圍之下，未免驚惶失措。六年前米奇亞可夫尙不到二十歲，實一未成年之孩童，本律師曾詢依凡諾夫，其時形勢既如此緊張，何不多派崗警防護，乃任一未成年之孩童，負此重任？今被吿雖承認開槍，然不能證實其爲殺人。本案有二點値得注意；（一）何玉相之死，當時因孤軍營謝團長不准白俄入營，故未曾祥細調査，同時開槍者非米奇亞可夫一人，六年後之今日，更不能證實何玉相究死於何人之槍彈。犯罪茲礎既未確定，何能定罪？（二）行爲之本身：米奇亞可夫外受民衆包圍，內有孤軍呼應，形勢自極嚴重，根據孤軍營警衛訓令，崗警如遇脅逼，或有被繳械危險時，可開槍射擊，被吿白俄未受良好教育，對法令之解釋當不十分淸楚，而此法令係由英駐軍頒佈，白俄隊之入伍書中，亦說明一切遵守英國軍隊規律，故被吿之開槍，應否負法律責任，請鈞院裁奪，並請求予被吿無罪之判決，或最輕之處罰。至此審判長宣佈辯論終結，定二十八日下午二時宣判，被吿還押。</p>

<h3>美醫藥援華會舉行雞尾酒會　史蒂文斯談蘭州印象好　後日召開業務會議決定明年救濟方針</h3>

<h3>上海扒窃黨的黑幕（三）</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>帽子到手鴻飛冥冥</p>
<p>「捉烏龜」便是擔帽子，尤其是名貴的西式呢帽。上海人統稱爲「拋頂宮」，幾乎變成盡人皆知的語詞，此中人卻已放棄不用了。凡是有搶帽特拔的「硬扒」弟兄，他們總是二三成羣，徘徊於電車公共汽車站上，預先看準了靠近車窗的乘客所戴帽子，一俟開車，便沿窗搶奪而去。失主勢不能立刻下車，况且車廂中往往擠得像沙丁魚一般，等乘客下得車來，早已鴻飛冥冥了。在人力車三輪車飛馳之時，那車上乘客的呢帽也是很好的目的物。扒竊黨祇要輕舒猿臂，一摘即得·於是急望反對方向狂奔，乘聞交給了帮手，即有警補追捕，也時常失之交臂。在兩路局火車月臺上也往往有此輩「扒竊黨」在「捉烏龜」。年來路警戒備較嚴，此輩的踪跡，方才不大發見在月臺上。</p>
<p>「硬扒黨」的活動小組都是受着「爺叔班子」所支配，時間和地段均係頸先劃定，而且不是帮外的「洋盤」所得侵入「搶生意」的。</p>
<p>他們下手的時間規定在淸晨，晌午，和黃昏。因爲淸晨是市民塵集在車站的時候，午晚又是馬路上行人來往擁擠，都有利於下手後的脫逃。其活動地點都選擇在支路繁多，或是里弄紛歧之處，由小組中的一位能手進行搶奪，立即在奔，這時失主自必追呼尾追，於是同黨乃冒充爲不相干的路人，攔住失主假作問訊，藉以躭誤失主的時間，並可防止路見不平者的追逐。依此戰略隨機應變，讓那個搶物的同夥，得從容由支路里弄逃出險境，此輩同夥名爲「擋風」。</p>
<p>鬼鬼崇崇花樣繁多</p>
<p>「文差事」乃是「吃壞飯」的第二種，他們不像「硬扒」帮的巧取豪奪，而是鬼頭鬼腦的「鼠竊狗偷」因某行爲比較斯文，故稱爲「文差事」，其活動類別及演出方式有如下列：</p>
<p>（一）翻高頭」——此帮行竊時，總是利用粗繩或木梯，通過了人家的墻頭或屋頂，翻入屋內，然後下手。</p>
<p>（二）「揆扇子」—行竊時用鐵梗小刀撬門而入。</p>
<p>（三）「跑早淸」——民家住宅，大都於淸晨開門倒馬桶，或從事打掃，小竊即於此時乘機掩入，順手牽羊。</p>
<p>（四）「跑燈頭」—又名「烏頭」。在旁晚黃昏之際，住戶大都虛掩後門，小竊便乘機掩入活動·</p>
<p>（五）「上天表」——民家每日在晒臺上凉衣，或在天井曝晒，大都無人看管，小竊用長竹竿把衣裳挑下來，其間乾濕，一律席捲而逃。</p>
<p>（六）「切克子」——凡有住宅將門戶鎖住的，足見其內無人。小竊如果事先探知其家股富，便乘人不備毀鎖入內，從容竊取。</p>
<p>（七）「跑窰堂」—此帮偸竊却不規定時間，其活動方式亦極自由，不問何物，竊得即走。不論何時，得隙即進。而且須有鑒別力，不値錢的東西是不會帶走的。例如走入大戶人家，便注意廳堂上的古玩字畫，鐘屛鼎器之類。</p>
<p>（八）「開桃源」—掘壁洞竊物，又名「開窰口」。</p>
<p>（九）「上閂子」—即橇窗賊。</p>
<p>（十）「下閂子」—即撬門賊。</p>
<p>（十一）「闖窰堂」借問訊問路爲由，乘間闖入民家偸竊。</p>
<h3>「五金大王」審結候判　張蓮舫一篇「大道理」家屬泣不成聲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有上海「五金大王」之稱之張述舫，勝利後被以漢好嫌疑罪逮捕。由高檢處偵査終結，提起公訴，列舉罪狀三點：（一）任僞上海市五金號業同業公會理事長，（二）任偽五金鋼業鐲條聯合辦事處主任，（三）任僞黃浦區第二聯保第六保保長，有代敵征購獻鐵等行爲。該案經高院數次開庭調査，昨日下午開辯論庭審結，定本月二十九日宣判。</p>
<p>張昨在庭上供稱：公會理事長會辭職二十餘次，皆因同業之「推戴挽留」而未果。此純爲同業謀「福利」，並無危害國家之事。至民國三十年十二月八日太平洋戰爭起，日人有計劃行動，將本市五金，銅條，銅錫、鋼鐵四同業所有倉庫査封，下令須將存貨登記，在當時環境之下，無法抗拒，乃組織聯合辦事處，以謀對付。該處僅一書記，一茶房，並無委員主任之類名義，僅係各同業日常聚會之所，以謀搶救物資保障工商業，爲國家稍稍保存元氣。該五金辦事處成立後，並未以五金資敵，亦未代敵搜括。因同業既己將存貨向敵人登記，彼要多少，即拿多少，結果敵海軍拿去一千二百噸，敵陸軍拿去七百噸，總約二千噸左右。此事並未經過聯合辦事處，面係各同業單獨之事。至任偽保長，則因在上海稍有地位，故被迫指定担任。民國三十三年時敵僞發動全市保甲舉行獻鐵運動，召開保長大會時，本人未出席，結果由聯保長命令若保長轉甲長專轉各戶，由各戶將　直接送往僞警局，並未經保長辦事處之手。此在當時環境之下，市民亦係逼不得已。本入純爲商人，並無　敵之意，抗戰初期，因七十六號之若迫參加僞組織，曾一度逃往香港’後因同業之堅邀乃返滬維持公會。後曾偸運物資赴內地而爲敵所知，乃北捕非刑拷打，當時祗望天日重光，至今却因漢奸罪被扣已一年多，眞是寃枉到極點。如我是甘心附逆，可請重辦，否則請酌量事實而　罪云。言至此，其在座旁聽之家屬已泣不成聲。審畢，被吿仍由法警押回監獄</p>

<p>一鳴問鄙人有法律疑問數點，希詳予解答：民國卅二年，某甲以地產二分央乙爲中，押與先父，廿九年家鄉淪陷後，乙藉惡勢力自甲處收買，該地當時亦未通知鄙人，（現甲已去世），勝利後，鄙人託人向乙交涉乙即串通余之庶母，僞造失票，其中書明從前某甲担抑與先父時，借票已經遺失，款已償還，立此失票爲憑，失票上並蓋有先父遺印，茲有問題數則，請賜解答。（一）原中，買主，俱爲乙包辦，並未通知鄙人，能否加以否認？（二）甲已去世，其產業可否作爲鄙人所有，而申請土地登記？（三）僞造先父失票，可否控訴法庭？（四）先父遺印登報作廢，可否與失票同時作爲無效？</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕（一）不可。因不動產所有人，設定抵押權後，得將不動產讓與他人，亦並無一爲設定抵押權之中入，即不能爲買主之規定。（二）不可。因抵押物之所有權逕行移屬於抵押權人，爲法所不許。（三）如確屬偽造，可以偽造文書罪控訴。（四）登報作廢，不能使事前已成立之票據作爲無效。</p>
<p>（二）押地回贖</p>
<p>任承甫問先祖父在民國三年以銀元六十元，押進活契基地一方，即建造房屋，因契約上善明期限五年爲滿，洋到回贖，及屆五年又增加銀元卅五元，復書契約一紙，書明　贖時連同前款一倂歸還，不得短少，十三年又以借據借銀元十元，見月三分生息，事變時房屋被敵人焚毀，直至敵人投降時我欲仍在該地建造房屋，押主則擬回贖，目前我雖勉强造屋，亦難免日後糾紛，究竟是項地產在法律上是否憑該任其回贖？請在貴欄答復。</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕査司法院解釋第二五五八號第七款，『淸理不動產典當辦法施行前，設定之典權，定有期限者，不問曾否以契約加長期限，均得於出典滿卅年後二年內回贖』。淸理不動產典常辦法施行於民國四年，本件典權設定於民國三年，自可依據上開解釋處理，至回贖典物之法定期間，因戰事不能遵守者，於復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例施行後二年內，仍得回贖典物，爲同條例第七條明文規定，故在法律上本件典物猶可國贖。</p>

<h3>毛絨綫評價　小組會調查成本標準分三等細絨綫另定此後派貨限於同業會員</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局所設置之毛絨綫審議委員會，昨日下午一十時，召開第二次會議，到毛絨綫工業公會商業公會代表陳奇恩沈萊舟及蜜蜂廠怡和廠等代表多人，市參議會及市商會亦派代表出席，主席爲顧處長炳元，先由工業公會報告成本計算，商業公會報告最近市況，覺旬日來毛絨綫市價，已跌落百分之二十至三十，按日下原毛市價及廠繳計算，似尙平落，羣相慶慰，惟以責在審議標準價格，工作仍須努力，當決定設置調査小組委員會，由局方同業公会及市商會三方面指派代表，會同調査實際成本，用作根據，其毛絨綫之標準市價，擬分三等評議，上等爲五十六支以上所製成者，如蜜蜂·變貓·英雄·風行·地球等牌是，二等爲五十六支以下所製成者，如金狗·美女等牌是，三等爲四十八支以下所製成者，如學士·小囡等牌是，成本之調查，即以此爲對象，但此三等皆屬四股粗絨綫，至於細絨綫常另定比率，隨之升降，關於進口行家原毛及絨廣之出售，應限於毛絨同業，市上經營毛絨綫者應加入同業公會諸點，同業公會代表主張頗堅，原則通過，並決定毛絨綫工廠此後之派貨，必須以同業公會會員爲限，以免業外人之破壞云。</p>
<h3>紗布交易平淡中商評價及攤派額複製業盼聯配繼續進行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午二時卅分，紡織事業管現委員副主委李升伯，特假第六區機器紡織工業同業公會會址，召集該會重要理事，舉行談話會，討論今後棉紗配銷之合理評價，及國民營紗廠攤派數額。歷三小時之硏討，聞僅限於意見之交換，並未獲致具體決議。</p>
<p>又據本市染織業某權威談稱：目前棉紗之聯配，亟應賡續不斷。各廠對聯配政策，尤應在誠懇坦白之態度中，覓具辦法，方克有濟。</p>
<p>昨日紗市略形軟化，客銷仍不踴躍，布廠亦因織成品呆滯而止辦，同時各大紗廠暗中頗有吐售，是以價見疲滯，然人心尙穩，不致十分大跌也。　昨日在市尙穩定，客帮如漢口南京帮，略有交易，惟胃口甚小，紡建開價，有新調整，藍鷄爲七七·〇〇〇元，惟新陽鶴仍站七七·〇〇〇元，本街各號申請者極少，染廠因實銷活，略有購進，但數目並不鉅，紗價如能抑平，則布市尙看軟。</p>
<h3>紡建收買新棉價格數量均無規定</h3>
<p>紡織公司，以目前各地新棉登塲，爲充裕紡織原料，維護護國棉增產，現決定開始盡量收買，該公司已分別飭由各地辦事處展開收買工作，但並不採取限價制度，而視產區成本，再定合理之價格，收買之數量亦未規定，其收買之地區有汕市西安南通等處，最近新成立之鄭州辦事處，亦爲收買之產區，唯在該公司收買之地區，所有民營紗廠可自由採購，並不予以限制。</p>
<h3>棉花押滙外得轉做押款</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕本年棉花自產區運往用棉地區押滙辦法，前經四聯總處核定原則五價，茲聞該處現再訂定補充辦法三項，（一）自九月廿日以後，各廠向產區所購之棉花，於運抵廠址後，得依照原定原則，申請轉做押款，期限最長不得超過四十五天；（二）各廠原已購存之棉花，一律不得申做押款；（三）各廠申請轉做押款時，應提供原做押滙證件或相等之證件，以備査核，期於協助產銷，棉花外運製銷之中，不致有助長囤積之弊。上項辦法，頃已由四聯總處分電各總行局轉行遵辦，並分電各分支處轉知當地各行局洽照辦理。</p>
<h3>金·剛·鑽中印需要最殷</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕在若干國家中金剛鑽之需要甚殷，尤以中國與印度爲最顯著，因國內局勢之不定，故購買金剛鑽仍爲保持價値之最簡捷辦法。寳石之價格雖較廉，但並不影響粗金剛鑽之市價，各方之需要較可能之供給量超出甚多。以美國及全世界之需要言之，求過於供至少爲三與一之比。</p>
<h3>公債盤旋洋行幫有納胃</h3>
<p>公債昨中途曾破二千元關，但因洋行帮頗有納胃，形勢尙盤，統丙昨晨開二〇七〇元、曾降至一九九〇元，不旋踵洋行方面來進百餘萬元，最後仍在二〇五〇元左右掙扎，與前收相彷彿，甲乙了各跌三十元，統戊微升二十元，成交約票面六百萬元·</p>
<h3>管制聲中　紗廠家三種願佢配花·不斷電·不硬性限價</h3>
<p>紡管會主委吳市長前日決定暫先配紗一萬〇五百廿九包，價格及日期另行決完，據紗廠業意見，在物資缺乏時，實難辦到公允而合理化，紗廠方面，外表雖尙繁榮。實亦空架子耳。例如目前所限價，每件一百五十五萬元，成本方面三担棉花約百萬元，再加電費利息及各項開支，已超過限價，有一時期，較其他各業稍勝一籌，但目前狀况，困難極多如電量不是姑勿論以電價而言，一度電原爲八十四元，但自以煤易電以來，每噸煤十二萬元，無形中每度電力已漲爲二百元，如生產力方面，過去每日工作十二小時一班，一日兩班，現在十小時一班，一天二十小時，過去十天一禮拜，現在七天一禮拜，且有時尙須輪流停電，廠方即欲增加生產，亦爲種種事實所限制，目前各紗廠念欲希望解決者，一實行配花，由政府儘量設法供給棉花原料，减輕成本，二供給電力，目前之輪流停電及突然抽電等辦法，實影響生產量之增加，三實行評價，而非硬性之限價云。</p>
<h3>美棉上落頗大</h3>

<h3>金鈔堅定</h3>
<p>烚赤由穩漸堅，晨開二二一萬光景，上塲時極爲平定，在二二一萬左右徘徊不已，十時後央行以二二一萬之價，配給一三〇條，此時亦少變化，迨後客銷略殷，銀根見鬆，近平買戶稍盛，午刻升至二二三萬以上，午後隔日交割初堅後平，結果較前收升一萬五，飾金紋銀銀元均無更動，暗拆銀根稍鬆，息價自一角半至一角七。</p>
<p>外幣平靜，美鈔門市仍以三五〇〇元爲買價，收入毫無，交易仍難開盤，暗盤中約四〇五〇元至四一五〇元，午後小升喊四一〇〇元至四二〇〇元，與前收相省同，港票平穩少變，結果平平，港匯因港申電報升少許，本市適逢實銷見呆而較低，晨初八八五元有售，後稍扳高爲八八〇元至九〇〇元，印滙一〇六〇元至一〇八〇元，英滙一四一〇〇至一四一二〇元，美滙牌價平，對做仍寂。</p>
<h3>鑫空角逐頗力華股初疲繼堅五和漲跌均停板</h3>
<p>華股昨初疲繼堅，空方首先動搖，有以致之，晨初各股開出尙形平穩，開後微穩，不久賣方活動，浮多恐慌未除，永紗退至七〇七元，美亞三七四〇元，景福二四六元，新光二五四元，信和三一二元，面後稍定，廣帮若二三二號等先來購買，形勢改觀，漸漸回升，檯面帮首先補空，十時二十分後，形勢轉風，塲外對敞方面有銀行帶力購永紗，軋空勢成，此後即一帆風順，團吿上騰，高價時尙多掙扎，近午多空勢成肉搏，拉鋸不已，午收較前收計熱門以永紗信和回升半成左右，美亞景福新光勤興微升而已，冷門除新亞小挫外，亦回升若干，午後上塲稍堅，續告微漲，經套利者回籠貨吐出者後，空方乘機來壓，二時半後復吿回落，臨收時低後轉盤，五和織造初時由七〇〇元賣價跌至跌停板，成交一個單位後，買戶聞訊而來，復吿拉高，臨收數分鐘內，二〇四號抬價而購，鈴聲一響，竟吿漲停板，變幻之速，創市場新紀錄，但成交極不普遍，結果較前收計熱股永紗信和景福微升，美亞平，新光勤興稍跌，冷股以五和獨昂一成半，大通榮豐內衣升半成，新亞中絲平平，公司水泥微挫，中紡統益火柴景綸華豐微升，塲外谷股除中法升半成外，餘者升降俱微。</p>

<h3>貨物新稅開征後　工廠多在停頓中收稅不過一億元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據財政部上海貨物稅局某負責人談稱：自財政部規定於本月一日起，開征七種新貨物稅後，本局即遵令施行。惟實際開征，不過近一週事耳。在本市開征之稅目，亦僅麥粉，皮毛，水泥，飲料品，及化粧品等五種。其他茶及錫箔兩種，均在產區征稅，而於輸入上海時，加以査騐。茶葉一項，如確係裝運出口，且可免征貨物稅。各稅開征迄今，已收到之稅款，約在一億元以上。本局爲征稅方便訂，曾派員分駐各廠，惟發覺大部工廠，均在停頓狀態中。</p>

<h3>美國萊恩教授在我教部演講　現代教育趨勢打破班級帛度課和要有伸縮性人與人社會關係爲施教對象　美國最近成立兒童教育聯合會</h3>

<h3>國楨盃排球女子組友聯獲得決賽權　昨複賽三比一淘汰務本男子賽粵剛受挫於蘇聯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」國楨盃排球聯賽，昨夜有複賽二幕，俱爲勢均力敵之對抗，攸關錦標甚大，爭鬥劇烈，精彩百出，女組友聯以三對一力克務本，獲得決賽權，男子組則粵剛以二比三敗於蘇聯。</p>
<p>友聯力戰得勝</p>
<p>自王務醴由務本改隸友聯後，後者之實力驟增，似有穩得冠軍之勢，但昨友聯表演，顯然生疏，各個地位，缺少契默。據友聯陳梅貞云，該隊隊員各以職務及學業關係，致疏練習，不無原因。務本在頹勢下，努力作戰，故予友聯之威脅力甚大，友聯勝來煞費苦心，現友聯已擊退務本，將遇友隊決冠軍，依昨戰情形，尙須經過一番努力也。</p>
<p>女組友聯對務本，友聯陸兆珊首先發球，李玻失手，友聯獲分，務本衆將，小心翼翼，比數尙見接近，第一局終，友聯以廿一比十九佔先，第二局中，友聯曾以七比一前導，惟務本力追，反以九比八超出，友聯企圖挽回，奈陸翠芳動作遲緩，弱點顯露，遂爲務本所乘，結果廿一比十四，務本扳成平局。第三局雙方競爭更見熱烈，比數此起彼落，備見緊張，屢度平手後，友聯賴陳梅貞扣壓見功，以廿一比十九再勝務本，第四局務本曾以十一比五領前，友聯力追以十四比十一，後來居上，結果友聯以最後之努力，以廿一比十八勝，總結三對一，友聯淘汰務本。</p>
<p>粵剛慘遭淘汰</p>
<p>蘇聯本有獲取盃賽之決心，聯賽既失，對此國楨盃更具雄心，粵剛亦然，惜以健將鄭亦泉因病不克到塲，損失非淺，粵剛昨敗究全吃虧在們人殺球，蘇聯則壓殺並施，且長力又足，既成二對二，最後一局，粵剛便爾不濟矣。</p>
<p>男子複賽，粵剛與蘇聯登塲，粵剛謹愼從事，比數緊凑，易地時粵剛以十一比十佔先，再戰，雙方短兵相接，結果粵剛以廿一比十六，佔勝第一局，第二局蘇聯力圖振作，獲分累累，以廿一比十二扳成平手，第三局競爭益見劇烈，此起彼落，粵剛以十七追成落後，形勢危急，傾力反攻，追成各廿，奈又以廿一比廿三再失一局，第四局粵剛突見順手，以十一此六佔先，結果粵剛以廿一比十六，收復失地，二造平局，末局雙方小心翼翼，戰局更見緊張，造十一比八，蘇聯更見凶猛，粵剛終以十三比廿一遭慘敗，總結蘇聯以三對二力挫粵剛。</p>

<h3>雷霆萬鈞壓張垣一個倖免於全燬的葫蘆與其說是參觀·無甯說是憑弔！</h3>
<p>— 十八日北平航訊　本報記者宋紹柏</p>
<p>記者在十八日隨「中外記渚張垣參觀團」由北平到張垣，與其說是「參觀」，毋甯說是「憑弔」。傳長官本月初在綏遠紀念週講話，曾鄭重地說：「雖然打了勝仗，但只有沉痛而無快意，」因爲死亡的都是中國人！」張頃經歷了這次的災難，毀滅的完全是由國的人民和其血汗之所經營。</p>
<p>上午八時半，人們乘上飛機，爲了便利攝影記者，飛機在北平上空繞過二週後，向西北飛去，因爲是上坡路，多走了幾分鐘，到張垣上空繞了一小時。在機上　環山的張垣·像個胡蘆，是個不宜守的地方，不論其北的張北，其西的柴溝堡，西東的宣化，只要一旦被進攻部隊控制，這葫蘆裏的守軍，必須考慮及早撤出。張垣這個「葫蘆」之得以倖免於全燬，似乎與它的地勢不無關係。</p>
<p>張垣有二個機塲，楡林堡的一個較大的已經被共軍澈底破壞。在機上看見洋灰跑道，已被炸得遍體鱗侮，我們便降落在較小的姚官屯機塲上。坐上十二戰區預爲準備的卡車入市，沿途看見了刧後的張垣。</p>
<p>市民惡夢方醒</p>
<p>車行街上，看見兩側排列的一眼望不到頭的歡迎民衆。記者們似乎感覺到興奮，但那些坐在地上的人，並沒有站起來，更聽不到歡呼，細看那三角旗上寫的却是「微迎勞苦功高的陳總長」。記者們明白了。那些民衆一個個呆呆地沒有什麼表情，看不出是喜歡是苦惱，好像惡夢方醒，還沒有淸楚過來。大多數商店住戶門上插着國旗，顏色與縐紋都不像才做的。後來問一個商人，他說過去是不常掛的，舖戶門口也立着不少人，大家似乎都在茫無頭緒的看熱鬧，除去淸理斷瓦頹垣的人有工作和成列的小攤等待懷有法幣的軍人照顧外，很少看見人有工作。小商店雖都開市，但呈現着一片冷淸。市民們還沒有法幣買東西，「邊幣」則失去效用了。標話已經煥然）新，佈吿牌上，貼上了「張家口警備司令部佈吿」。每一佈吿前都圍上一堆人。「解放大飯店」，「新華書店」，「晉察冀……」的牌匾，高懸未去，但有的己經被火燒焦。慶豐大戲院門前標出「今日開始演戲，」妓館的「××書院」「××閣」照舊開着。這裏已經看不見「蒙攝」時期的絲毫陳跡，他替的是我們自己的破壞與殺擄。</p>
<p>車站破壞最慘</p>
<p>破壞最慘的是車站，偌大的一長列建築。完全燒了。車皮燒焦，車頭與重頭互撞，未毀的機器凑成了一個車頭，預定今天先用此車頭使穴化張家口間通車。發電廠完全破壞，大街上拖着隧地的電綫，但也收拾好了一個小發電機。傳長官辦公的地方，十七日起恢復了電燈。自動電話機完全燒燬。據說以此項恢復最難。廣播電台重要機件，已被運走，最近可恢復一小型電台。最徼倖的是向來水，這是那廠子的工人救了它，通地雷的火綫被入偷偸卸去了。</p>
<p>隨部隊的進駐，張垣已經成立一個「十二戰區臨時政務委員會」辦理善後政務，主任委員是十二戰區政治部副主任周鈞·這個委員會的常前急務，的有下列幾點。土地產權問題，婚姻問題，共黨工作人員的自白自首，貨幣的整理，緊急救濟等問題。</p>
<p>恢復土地產權</p>
<p>關於土地產權問題，傳長官已經得到中央的指示，原則上只要所有人提出證據，（失去證據者，可由隣人作證。）無論經過如何的「鬥爭」，可恢復其所有權。但爲了顧及耕作人的損失，也承認耕作人的使用權與收穫權，地租不許超過全收穫量的百分之十五。如果經過二次以上的「鬥爭」，則最初耕作者，應得百分之卅五，中間耕作者，應得百分之卅五，收穫者應得百分之廿五，地主仍舊是百分之十五。這一過沒辦法，維持到今年底，以後將根據土地法，實行「限地政策」。預定計劃是每人約合廿畝，五口之家，最多不許過二百畝，地租將較二五减租的辦法更少。根據實際情形，定成與現在的過渡辦法大致相同的標準，亦即地租應不超過百分之十五或十。據臨時政委會主委周鈞說：此種限制地租辦法，在綏柬綏西已見諸實行。綏西是百分之十，綏東是百分之十五，全省實行者約佔三分之一地區，也還沒有多大困難。不過察省將來實行限出辦法，困難的是中央的地方能否籌出如許多的款子收買地主的土地，分給無地者。據他的推斷，地方可籌百分之十或二十。所以明年能否有效的實行此一政策，還不能斷定。但據周氏表示：爲了實踐民生主義，對抗共黨的一套，這是必要而刻不容緩的。</p>
<p>貨幣問題麻煩</p>
<p>貨幣問題也是當前比較麻煩的問題，共黨發行的「邊區券」，己禁止行使。現在所有的是十二戰區隨軍帶去的四千萬法幣，小額幣的缺乏，也需要立刻解決。所以長官部貸給了商會二千萬，並准其發行臨時小額流通券，十八日已開始行使。張垣的物價還米受刺激，麵粉每斤四百元，大米五百元，白布九萬元一匹，但人們恐懼着交通恢復後貨幣不缺時的上漲，會是驚人的，因爲張垣實際上已經沒有多少東西。中央銀行有人與記者等同機到了張垣，籌備設立分行　婚姻問題較易解決，已定出的原則是無問題者聽其自由，有問題者以女方意見爲主。</p>
<p>辦理工人登記</p>
<p>張垣的失業工人，還沒有統計起來。連同宣化龍烟煤礦工人算起當不下萬餘人。其他因戰爭而急需救濟者尙多。對於工人，臨政會決定即日起登記，光使之整理殘破的工廠，日給以千元至一千五百元，等於以工代振。此外，行總亦有五人與記者等同機到張，帶去了四千萬現鈔，辦理急振。</p>
<p>自白白首運動很有效。自白自首者已有二千五百多人。當局宣佈：只要自白自首，並獲得保甲的保證，即予以自新之路，不咎既往，同時禁止報復行爲。收復張垣已一週，尙未見報復行爲發生。一般民衆似乎已經都很開明，這一點當局認爲很好。</p>
<p>教本發生恐慌</p>
<p>張垣原有小學四十餘所，學生的萬人，經此變更，未受太大損失，都己經恢復開課，中共敎科書已廢止，可是新敎科書尙無着落，這是一個急待解決的問題·中等以上的學校，以前有男女市立中學，農科職業學校，商科職業學校，鐵路學院，醫科專門學校，工業專門學校，及回民中學。內蒙軍政學院，學生的二千人。此外，有華北聯合大學，（延大，魯藝，外語，及教育學院合併者）學生數字不詳·這些中等以上學校的學生，共軍撤退時，都已自動或被迫隨軍撤出·據十二戰區長官部的王秘書說，隨共軍撤出的學生約共六千餘人，其中有八百人，在路上以思想不良的名義槍殺了。現在有一部分已陸績回來。共黨晋察冀日報撤退前一日還出版，臨走將日本遺留在華北三部大型滾洞機之一的機器毀成了廢鐵。歸綏的奮鬥日報，前三天出版了張垣版。</p>
<p>將軍態度謙和</p>
<p>在張垣，我們會見了傅作義和董其武將軍，他們都穿了一身和士兵完全相同的草綠色軍服，他們沒有以勝利爲光榮，態度很謙和。傅長官希望記者們隨便和任何一個人接觸，以便知道張垣前後的眞實情形。傅長官的秘書長王明德先生陪記者跑了半天，他說：十二戰區的官兵精神是「待遇儘管不同生活必須一致，」不許有小廚房，衣食住行操作官與兵完全一致。記者也沒有看出二樣來。</p>

<h3>廣西婦女的憂鬱</h3>
<p>— 十一日桂林航訊　本報記者梁小中</p>
<p>最富於神秘性的草如左江一帶女郞「招郞入舍」的情形，爲了生活的需要，許多女人往往看中一些異鄉的孤客，然後把他贅入家中，委身而事，（自然這些女人都已經從自己的勞力里積下了不少的錢），偶然丈夫思鄉心切，要回鄉一行，這便產生了「放罍」的故事，妻子會盡量把丈夫供給得無限的闊綽而「衣錦榮歸」，然而却嚴厲地可囑了地底歸期，假如依期回到妻子家裏，自然沒有甚麽事情，萬一逾期不返，十九都會肚皮腫漲而駕鶴西游·這些香艷而又恐怖的傳說，至今還流行在廣西境裏，成了稗官野史筆底絕好材料。</p>
<p>南國遐荒的傜家女郞，在謌舞和愛情的伊甸園裏生長。歌唱是她們的春天。她們底甜夢，萬壑千山里的幽林溪測，平原上放目千尋的芳草河岸，到處是不同的語言，到處有嘹亮的歌聲，那末柔和，純眞而又可愛。桂東南一片廣大山村的婦女，永遠熱情地崇拜着一個歌唱的女神，　往着她底歌喉的神話，相傳謌仙的名字呌做劉三妹，是鬱江河畔貴縣的龍山鄉人，（她底名字正和昭耀百世的民族英雄翼王石達開一樣深印在貴縣人的心里，引爲無上的光熒），這農家的美麗姑娘，生來便愛唱山歌，不論收牛，插秧，耘田，割茅草……甚麼時候都可以聽見她那嬌迷的聲音，廻蕩在靜寂的天空里。一曲河梁，幾聲嚶啘，沈醉了壯健的少年，撩逗着青春的少年，帶下了大地的微笑……然爾，醜惡的命運却給她帶來了一個嫂嫂的欺凌，磨折和嫉忌，一心要殺害這無邪的小姑，於是，有一天借着砍柴爲名，把三妹帶到一個非常峻峭的山巔，然後把她向前一推，滿以爲結束了三妹的性命和歌聲，那知道正在三妹懸空墜下的時候，却抓到了一根十年古籘，搖曳在萬丈深谷的中間，面對着急湍奔湃的溪水，三妹的歌聲又響了：「嫂嫂要害劉三妹，多謝一根千年籘」，歌聲正完，峭壁上的一扇石門，「呀」地一聲開了，劉三妹便帶着歌聲，走入了洞門，成了歌仙。故事輕鬆而又有趣，劉三妹的靈魂永生在姐兒們底心上，多少人在唱着「不信但看劉三妹，歌唱應過九重山」。歌唱不但應過九重山，歌唱還是多少婚姻自由底山國裏面女郞的撮合山。臘盡春圍，梅冷桃艷底時候，偶然一次山村空前的節目，（譬如農厂的春節，桂西傜區的盤古　，萬岡一帶的擲蛋節……整個鄉村的男女，完全沉浸在瘋狂的歌舞裏，明月照人，流水度曲，平地一陣山風掠過，妙受的愛　嘹繞着幽深的松林，女的唱一個：「天上星星滅又明，一條銀河冷淸淸，誰人數得天星　，我便插翼飛上天。」男的答一個：「天上星星夜夜明，不是阿哥數不淸，最怕數到天星盡，阿味不把銀河行」。一酬一唱，委娜斯和邱必特底情箭便輕輕地插入他們底心房裏，等到月落烏啼，曉烟催人的時候，多少情侶，早已手携着手，踏入女孩子父親的家里，說個明白，跟着便是一番禮聘，（桂西南的傜人要若千頭牛和白米，大籘山傜區則喜歡要數百塊雪白的龍洋，說起大籘山傜區，至今還有一個金綉傜王的「駙馬爺」，是以前省府的紅人，不過這駙馬之所以能够「尙主」，却不是由唱歌而由宣慰得來），於是，多謝歌仙的遺響，又一對有情人成了眷屬，這是傜國的春色，也是山地的一頁詩篇。</p>
<p>然而，悲喜劇的收塲，往往是女人遭受着最可痛的犧牲，兩年來的戰火和災荒摧殘了廣西的軀體，六百多萬的婦女担受了加倍的苦痛，草根和樹皮塞斷了她們天眞的歌聲，飢餓和貧困成脅着她們丈夫和兒女的生存，多少純潔的靈魂出賣了賤價的肉體，多少導上的明珠無可奈何變了別人的婢妾，無限的哀愁敎她們流不盡林黛玉一樣的眼淚，空虛的肚皮，敎地們過着比趙五娘更可悲的生活。蒼天究竟賜了些甚麽幸福給廣西的女人？</p>

<h3>訪中·主黨和·席尢永昌</h3>
<p>— 十二日廣州航訊　本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>「中國中和黨」這個名字，過去似乎是很少見到的，相信不少人感到這個黨有點陌生，所以當這裏報章披露中和黨領袖抵穗的消息時，市民們街談巷議地惴測着：大槪又是一個什麽新的政黨產生，連記者也有同樣的感覺，於是在一個秋高氣爽的下午，記者懷着好奇的心情，走到新亞酒店七一五號房間裘，訪問該黨主席尢永昌先生·</p>
<p>尢先生，現年已六十一歲，他的面型瘦削，顴高腮陷，眼凹準隆，頭上的白髮，和唇問掛着的銀鬚，顏色配合得很調和；常他接見記者時，總是笑容可掬地、使人的一種感覺，是在和一位慈祥的長者談話。</p>
<p>沈冼尢三姓本是一家人</p>
<p>尢先生的姓氏，本來是尤字沒有頭上那于點的「尢」字，所以許多人的讀法都不同，有人　尤字，也有人讀汪字音；記者遂先以此請教，他就解釋這個姓氏的來源，他說他們的始祖本來是沈的，後來經過一次變亂，旗人柬離西散，便分作沈，洗，尢三姓，其實都是、一家；他們的原籍本是江蘇無鍚，後來尢姓便寄籍在廣東的順德縣了。至於這個尢字，應談讀作與注同音，但大家都叫我做尤先生，那我祗好姓「尤」了。他祗是說明他的姓氏，也不怕麻煩的說了好幾分鐘，從這裏也可以見到，他是一個健談的人物。</p>
<p>中和黨黨史已垂六十年</p>
<p>談話轉到正題，尤氏對記者關於中和黨的黨史和現况的詢問，便作以下的槪述：</p>
<p>「中和黨是先父尢列創於淸光緒年間，成立於丁丑年三月十九日，歷史已垂六十年。當時是繼興中會後與先總理同一主義而分別組織的政黨。孫尢二先生是同年誕生，同時起義，同時逃亡東京及南北美洲，游說革命；當時淸廷號爲革命四大寇的，就是總理，先父，和陳少白，楊鶴齡兩先生等四人。中和黨數十年來，是由先父尢列領導，先父逝世後，海內外諸同志即推本人承繼。現有黨員約三百萬人，以南洋羣島各埠僑工佔多數，然國內亦不少，長江以北各省約佔三十萬，廣州現有黨員雖未作正確調査，但相信總在中萬以上，因爲中和黨的黨員多數是「世襲」的，所以祇會增加不會减少。抗戰開始，本人曾從香港走曲江桂林等地，發動黨員參加抗戰工作。曾一度爲了交通斷絕，和各地黨員失了聯絡，現在正打算重新調査，實行振興黨務；目前中央執行部是設在香港九龍，不久即遷至上海。」</p>
<p>歴史性國璽將獻呈政府</p>
<p>尢先生口若懸河地，一勁兒說了一大遍，似乎越說更越興奮，臉上露着很得意的顏色。接着，他又說：</p>
<p>「本人此行是來視察中和然在廣州的黨務，不日即偕同中和黨籍的國火代表赴京，將『中華民國萬歲』國璽，在國民代表大會時呈獻國民政府。這國　是在光緒廿八年，總理與先父在東京擬定國號曰『中華民國』時所刻用的；璽是象牙質，約有一方寸大小，刻有『中華民國萬歲』六個篆字，頂有兩獅子，非常精緻。西曆一九〇一年元旦日，中和黨在東京舉行第一次大會時，開始啓用；後來在蔣主席五一壽辰時，也曾用過，以外就很少用的·」</p>
<p>遲遲獻國璽係秉承庭訓</p>
<p>他說完了這一段，倒使記者有點疑問。因爲這既然稱做國璽，那何以不早呈獻給國民政府呢？他的解答是這樣：</p>
<p>「先父早擬將此璽呈給總理，德理以此乃國家至寳，囑先父在完成國民革命，國民大會召開時始交出；民廿五年，中央電召先父入京，共商國是，先父即擬在其時呈獻於國民大會，以示隆重；可是後因國難嚴重，國大停開，先父不幸逝世首都。彌留時，囑余必須於國大揭幕時呈獻，所以保留到現在哩！」</p>
<p>最後他又說：「先父爲開國元勳，革命功績彪炳，畢生公爾忘私，淡泊明志，生前與鄒海濱，居覺生，戴季陶諸先生甚友善，自逝世後在京公葬，友好並在港創立尢烈紀念中學，此校是蔣主席題贈校名的。現粵方同志亦有在此設立分校之擬議，而本人亦感覺，在此建國期間，作育英才，實爲當前的急務！」</p>
<p>他似乎感慨地說了這一段時，記者還想發問，而尢氏已有其他的應酬，記者便祗好辭退了。</p>
<p>對時局意見發表十言張</p>
<p>最後，記者在這裏想順便報吿一件事，中和黨會於本年九月九日，十國府蔣主席對時局意見書一通。內容雖未發表，但該黨對目前政見會公開發表，有十大主張，內容爲國家民族至上，復員建設第一，應即停止內戰，相誠協向國她是。</p>

<h3>多瑙河煩惱多　美蘇爭奪航權攸關歐洲和平</h3>
<p>美國最近曾在兩個國際會議中力爭着攸關歐洲和平的一個問題—開放一七五〇哩長的多瑙河以供國際貿易無限制便用的問題。在巴黎和會中，在蘇聯反對之下及美國撤回各項特殊建議以後，通過了一個召集多瑙河國際化特別會議的含糊的提案。同時在成功湖那裏，聯合國經濟社會委員會通過了一個大同小異的美國提案。但是在蘇聯控制下的各國曾經揚言拒絕參加反對他們單獨管理多瑙河的任何國際會議。</p>
<p>因此這一個問題不免再度發生，使聯合國難於應付。以下是美國「新聞週報」的柏林特派員霍華德從維也納發出的一篇通訊，詳述這一個複雜問題背後的種種重因素。</p>
<p>維也納人有一名根據史特勞斯華爾茲舞曲編成的諷刺妙語，叫做「美國佔據維也納森林，蘇聯佔據藍色多瑙河」。理由是：美國官員及其眷屬居住在維也納城美國佔領區中「維也納森林」裏的徽發房屋中，而從上奧地利恩斯到黑海的一段多瑙河及其支流則在蘇聯控制之下。</p>
<h3>美國控制五分之一</h3>
<p>— 佐溪譯</p>
<p>實際上美國控制着多瑙河全長的五分之一，包括自凡登堡州烏爾穆城至奧國美佔領區內的林茲一段狹隘的多瑙河上游，由此沿南岸至恩斯，在那裏蘇聯人置有水底電綫。在此林茲以上的一段河中，美國人擁有多瑙河船隊的三分之一，該船隊包括奧·捷·南·匈·法·保·羅及養國船舶九百七十一艘，這些船隻曾在大戰最後數月中載運撤退德僑及供應物，或在大戰結束以後向上游逃避以免被蘇軍俘獲。其中三十四艘是載客輪船，一百零五艘拖船，五十五艘摩托駁船和油槽船。其餘是普通駁船·油糟船和起重機船等雜色船隻。</p>
<p>美國工程師已把德國境內從林茲到黎根斯堡的河道淸除，並設有多瑙河輪船公司三家，經理二百九十六哩長美國佔領區內一段河流的航務。那三家公司便是粵國多瑙河輪船公司（DDSG），巴威勞愛德輪船公司及粵國所有而荷蘭特許的科莫斯輪船公司。九七一艘船隻中三百九十艘爲多瑙河輪船公司資產，該公司在蘇聯佔領區內所有的船隻和其他設備在去年冬間被蘇車根據波茨坦協定認爲「德國資產」而予以沒收，該公司乃請求　國人在多瑙河輪船公司的主權問題未獲解決以前，勿將船隻放出行駛。該公司要求蘇方繳還被蘇方沒收的碼頭設備和船隻二百二十艘。奧國議院雖已將該公司收歸國有，而該公司現已變成奧政府的資產，但蘇聯繼續以多瑙河輪船公司名義佔有並運用這些船隻和設備。</p>
<p>藍色消失</p>
<p>維也納人有一句成語，叫做情人眼裏的多瑙河始終是藍色的。但是事實上這條像死蛇般盤繞維也納城的油灰色的河流，瞧不見一些藍色的成份。從天空俯瞰，它像一條蒼蠅紙，上面黏附着破敗不堪的碼頭和堆棧，散佈着坍陷的橋樑，各種下沉船隻的突出水面的船身。維也納人喜歡聚集在河岸一帶，於樹蔭下休息讀書，甚至有赳赳武夫泅泳於此河流中。可是從林茲到維也納以下的一段，完全是發臭的死水，並無船隻行駛其間。維也納港口有着長亙十哩的船塢和碼頭，在戰前每年要呑吐一百七十萬噸的船舶，現在却淤塞而死寂了。</p>
<p>照蘇聯人講，多瑙河的咽喉是在圖倫的那座橋樑，距離維也納約十五哩，曾被希特勒的禁衛軍所破壞，五節橋樑全部折斷而陷落在河中。把岡倫橋從河底起出，須在危險的湍流中進行，必須要有特殊訓練的工程師，工人和水底設備，這一切蘇聯都付諸闕如。據奧國工程師估計，在正常的狀態下，有適當的工具和勞力，這頂橋可在三十天至四十天的時間內完全起出，但是蘇聯入只用一座起重機和少數奧國工人，歴時九個月，只起出了一節橋樑。</p>
<p>停頓狀態</p>
<p>本年七月第二星期，設在匈京布達佩斯的蘇聯多瑙河航運總部通函蘇聯控制下的各輪船公司，宣佈　維也納至黑海的一段多瑙河已經暢通，各公司只須在廿四小時以前預先通知，以確定天氣及河流暢通情形，即可自由運用該段河面。已經接受蘇聯此項建議的只有捷克輪船公司，是爲了從保加利亞載運木漿二千噸至捷克勃拉底斯拉伐。</p>
<p>在勃拉底斯拉伐以下，關於航行的危險程度，關稅章則，邊界檢查，各項捐稅，裝卸費等種種實情，不甚了了，而且有種種限制。甚至連蘇聯控制的範圍如何也在不可知之列。</p>
<p>多瑙河上並沒有經常的商業運輸。在保加利亞，羅馬尼亞和南斯拉夫境內行駛的船隻只有三百艘，在匈牙利境內行駛的約有三十至五十艘。但是因有水雷和障碍物的危險，運輸範圍僅限於單程交易，且冒着大險。英美官方深知蘇聯現正控制着通至黑海的北部河口，可是他們承認到於其他兩個河口及黑海口岸蘇里那的情况全然不知道。</p>
<p>這是一個很顯明的事實二戰前的多瑙河是中歐七個國家的貿易大動脈，往來行駛的全部船隻總計約三千艘，每年裝卸三百五十萬噸至四百萬噸的船貨，可是現在却陷於停頓狀態了。當歐洲正期待着和平解決之際，這七個國家本來可藉多瑙河貿易以重建其崩潰的經濟，現在却靠着聯總的救濟品和少數的貨運以苟延殘喘。</p>

<h3>波茨抇</h3>
<p>— 佐祺</p>
<p>自一九四五年五月德國投降以後，英（邱吉爾及阿特里）美（杜魯們）蘇（史達林）三國巨頭，爲了奠定世界永久和平，共商加緊對日作戰的計劃，七月聞逐在波茨坦（Potsdam）舉行會議，七月二十六日，由邱吉爾及杜魯門徵求中國蔣主席的同意，共同署名發表波茨坦宣言，而未及兩週，日本接受該宣言而投降，因此「波茨坦」三宇即轟傳全世界，而爲報章上的新聞名詞了</p>
<p>波茨坦位在德都柏林西南約十八哩　，濱哈維爾河，該地風景美麗，歷爲德國帝王駐紮所在，建築堂皇，波茨坦集議即在舊皇宮內開會。</p>
<p>前一時期，又有三巨頭再在波茨坦會晤，共商國際間難解的糾紛之說，但結果未成事實。</p>
<p>最近，美國對華政策協會，曾指責政府在波茨坦會議訂有有關中國的秘密協定，要求加以宣布，但美國務院否認有此事實。</p>

<h3>從巴黎到紐約時局重心仍在美蘇</h3>
<p>— 儲玉</p>
<p>巴黎和會結束了，各國代表相率返國，熱鬧了二個月又十八天的巴黎，頓時冷落了下去；而世人的視綫也從巴黎移到大西洋的彼岸紐約了。不但有聯合國大會定於本月廿三日在紐約開幕，而且四國外長會議也定於下月四日在紐約舉行。美國現正鬧着肉荒，一般人民「食無肉」，而今又來了大批國際貴賓，美國當局，不得不竭誠款待，　以佳餚，　荒更要嚴重了。</p>
<p>和平不易何日締成</p>
<p>我們暫且閉目遐想，即可知締造世界和平，實在不是一件容易的事情。歐洲戰事結束，迄今已一年有半，太平洋戰事吿終，也已一年有餘，可是眞正的和平，還沒有光臨世間；各國的政治外交家，雖在那裏爲和平奔走，橫一個國際會議，豎一個國際會議，千方百計，務使戰後的世界，早日恢復正常狀態，而使各國均能共享和平，不復遭遇侵略戰爭的威脅；但是一年半來的努力，僅僅完成了對義·羅·匈·保·芬五國的和約草案，而其他重要的問題，因爲四國外長會議未能解決，移交巴黎和會討論，巴黎和會未能解決，現又移交四國外畏會議處理。這等於兜了一個大圈子，回到了原來的出發點。間題的本身，依歸如故，未能解得絲毫解決。世界各國的人民，因爲受了這次大戰的浩刦，痛定思痛，企求和平的願望，實在太迫切，只要有一綫希望，終盼望其能豁然開朗。最初把一切希望，寄托在外長會議，等到幻滅之後，又把希望寄托在巴黎和會；現在巴黎和會又使世人感到幻滅的悲哀；可是世人的希望，又移轉到聯合國大會，甚至未來四國外長會議了。</p>
<p>世人的視綫，隨着希望而移轉，但是和平和平，究竟在那裏？依舊是一個猜不透的啞謎·</p>
<p>和會尾聲一個插曲</p>
<p>巴黎和會的末次會議，由我國代表團代理團長郭泰祺主持，替和會歌頌了一番，並盼望各國消除成見，爲和平而努力。美國國務卿貝爾納斯也說：『各國應互相認識，任何一國固不能在戰爭中單獨獲勝，同時也不能在平時單獨獲致和平。各國必須和衷共濟，爲人類造福。』其後英國外相貝文，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，亦也相繼發表演說，最後由法國外長比杜爾致閉幕詞。和會就此吿終。在這一天的會議席上，却沒有看見南斯拉夫的代表，據其投函末次大會主席郭泰祺，竟謂南國不贊成和會所通過的對義和約，巳決定退出和會了。巴黎和會的成就，巳够平凡了，最後還要暴露出一大弱點，實在太令人氣短了。</p>
<p>時局重心仍在美蘇</p>
<p>聯合國大會已決定如期開寡，四國外長會議也將在紐約舉行，因此大　都要問：會不會有良好的結果，我們的答覆是：『成敗的關　仍在美蘇關係上』。所以世人對於貝爾納斯於十八日發表的演說，都特別重視。演詞內容，有下列各點：（一）美國人民願向蘇聯伸出友誼之手；（二）外傅美國向蘇聯採取包開政策，此說全出於幻想；（三）促進美蘇諒解，殆爲今日政治外交家最感棘手的工作；（四）美國仍將反對個別同盟政策；（五）目下國際局勢最可憂慮者，乃在美蘇關係，已至山窮水盡。</p>
<p>貝氏的一番話，不但杜魯門總統完全同意，就是他的政敵華萊士也表示滿意，而認爲貝氏已有進步，但仍希望他續有進步。參議員范登堡所發表的演說，也擁護貝氏的政策，他說：『蘇聯既不願戰爭，美國亦不願戰爭，希望大家都不要再談戰爭。美國的外交政策，實爲和平政策，若不遭受國內的破壞，必能成功。』</p>
<p>貿易會議在英舉行</p>
<p>美國發起召開的國際貿易及就業會議，自十五日起，即在倫敦樂行預備會議，討論美國的建議，到了十九國的代表，蘇聯並未參加。美國代表魏爾柯克斯對於復興世界經濟，提出五項基本原則；（一）大量减低關稅壁壘；（二）各國互相交换貨物；（三）對於各國進口貨，不應予以歧視；（四）各國應保持高度的就業率；（五）各國在國際市塲上，一律平等。</p>
<p>我們研究美國發起此項會議的眞正動機，乃在恢復戰後國際貿易的自由，在原則上雖爲各國所同意；但是在事實上，仍有困難，第一是蘇聯的不參加，所謂國際貿易的範圍，不免太狹小了，第二是英法一時不能取消其對於進口貨的限制；第三是經濟落後的國家，欲實行工業化，非採取「適度的保護」不可。第四是美國倡導國際貿易自由運動，似不免帶有經濟的帝國主義的色彩·</p>
<h3>比國外長史巴克達小國間的折衝要人</h3>
<p>— 家南譯自『世界報告雜誌』</p>
<p>比利時外長史巴克現在是大小國間的一個重要折衝者·聯合國全體大會於十月廿三日在紐約開會時，他將再度出任主席。這位社會主義政治家的工作原則，就是實是求是。年輕的時候，他是一個社會運動的鼓動者，曾經搗毀過保守派報紙的窗戶，但是年齡和責任心逐漸使他變成一個富有理智的人物，並具提倡理智·譬如在巴黎和會中，澳洲外長伊瓦特使用直率的言語來迫使四强讓步，可是史巴克則用和緩的言語和妥協的辦法。</p>
<p>大國對於伊瓦特所提過半數決議對於四强應有約束力量的要求，斷然加以拒絕。但是當規程委員會主席史巴克建議大國對於三分之二多數過通的主張應自動予以採納的時候，他獲得美國務鄉貝爾納斯的支持。</p>
<p>史巴克擔任國際會議主席的時候，鎭靜而準確，眞是代表客觀性和公正態度的典型人物。他在一九二二年曾代表比利時參加國際網球比賽，球　車越，現在他在會議席上說話拔巧之靈活俄美，眞可以和　的　　媲美·</p>
<p>圓通辦法</p>
<p>在史巴克擔任主席的時候，辯論往往不致於弄僵。在四强面臨僵局的情形之下，這位比利時外長時常可以提出圓通的辦法。</p>
<p>在巴黎和會中，史巴克曾經和各國代表講過他們的爭執不休，會使世界上的人們想他們不是在規定對軸心國的條件，而在爭諭他們本身中間的和平問題。</p>
<p>史巴克擔任主席的時候，決不容許任何代表取巧，他在處理會議工作時，對於規則精神比對規則的文字更其重視。會議中如因混亂而發生失訣時，他的態度是寬容的，可是如其有人故意破壞規則來達到有利於自己的目的時，他的態度却極堅決。</p>
<p>史巴克在靑年時代曾經領導過社會主義者招搖過市去搗毀右翼報紙的窗戶。在二十年　　當過出色的律師而第一次引起人家的注意。他爲共產主義者辯護，並且替青年社會主義者著作火氣極重的小册子和演說。但是當他在卅九歲出任比利時首相時，他已是社會黨右翼的領袖和共產黨的對頭了</p>
<p>傑出人材</p>
<p>史巴克是比利時第一個著名社會主義女議員的兒子。他的父親是一個詩人，曾經寫過當時最成功的劇本。一九三八年，他出任比利時首相。</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰中，史巴克逃到法國而遭維希政府拘禁。其後又逃到西班牙而爲弗朗哥所扣留。他越獄而出，喬裝和尙，經葡萄牙而抵倫敦，重新參加比利時政府。</p>
<p>史巴克於一九三二年第一次被選入議會，一九三五年出任內閣閣員，翌年擔任外交部長。從那時起，他幾乎一直擔任這個職務，現在他是自由，社會，共產三黨聯合內蘭的外長。</p>
<p>一九三七年史巴克曾參加里奧波特國王的談判，結果使比利時擺脫了對法國和英國的軍事聯盟。但是孤立主義並沒有使比利時避免侵略，猶如在第一次世界大戰中中立並沒有使比利時逃過危機一樣。</p>
<p>可是史巴克和里奧波特國王不同，他出亡國外繼續抵抗。今日他已經反對里奧波特的向納粹屈服，不贊成他回國。史巴克現在主張和英法維特密切關係，成立聯防協定，但是他堅決聲明這並不是組織「西方集團」之謂。</p>
<p>這一種政策使蘇聯反對他担任聯合國全體大會主席。可是在看到史巴克的實際行爲之後，蘇聯方面也不得不承認他是一個出色的主席。</p>
<p>在聯合國全體大會於十月廿三日在紐約開會時，他又將以大小國間折衝者的姿態出現各國的代表之前了。</p>
<h3>日本戰敗言因　日記者加藤透露投降前三島真相</h3>
<p>日本著名新聞記者現任共同通訊社主筆加藤近著一書，名「戰敗記」，已於最近出版，內稱在原子炸彈降臨日本以前，美國的潛水艇早已給予日本以重大的打擊，在原子彈轟炸廣島以前一個月，日皇裕仁便想假手蘇聯覓求和平。在此以前日本更時時向中國試探和平。加藤用尋常新聞報導筆法寫他的文章，開頭便這樣寫着：「日本早已在臨死前的痛苦中掙扎着，第一顆原子炸彈的猝然降臨廣島，不過是促其死命的最後一擊而已。世界最新最猛烈的武器從夏天的空中浮現而出，只一擊就把那城市毀滅了，可是它的出現對於日美戰爭的結果倒並沒有多大的影響。」</p>
<p>加藤向聯合國讀者力言日本極權主義的錯誤，他歷述日本陸軍海軍和民衆的互相猜忌，日本熟練工人的管理不得法，以及戰爭各方面的拙劣的計劃，他又嚴酷地批許，在日本瀕於崩潰之際，日本陸軍猶岡故作鎭靜粉飾太平的那種可笑的姿態。他更叙述日本報紙的奴化情形，當其一旦恢復其自由時，竟至無所措手了。</p>
<p>八月十四日，內閣和其他領袖舉行的歷史性會議，首由首相檢討一般局勢，其後陸軍和海軍總參謀長以及陸相即籲請日皇重申國策繼續戰爭。至此內閣秘書引證日皇之言說。「假如別人並無意見表示，我們將表示我們的意見。我們決心要你們同意這一點……我們認爲詆剩一條路可以使日本得救。」</p>
<p>加藤對於日美雙方的宣傳加以批許稱：「照我私人的見解，日本在菲律濱的宣傳最爲失敗，在緬甸的宣傳最爲成功，成功主要的由於種族的呼籲與諾言。失敗由於不能把英美的潮流取而代之，以及不能或不願履行諾言。尤其在菲律濱那裏，隨着美國汽車，冰箱和摩登設備的來源突吿斷絕，使土人對於日人之侈談共榮很快的失去了信心·」</p>

<h3>蕭伯納</h3>
<p>— 張蔭槐</p>
<p>蕭翁九十歲了。七月廿六日是他的壽晨。蕭伯納不臺歡做生日，廿年前會罰着不再做第二個。那是一九二六年，他寫這：「對於這些讚美我的頌詞，我都能受之無愧。只是這是我的第一次慶祝誔辰，也是準備慶祝的末一次。」因爲這個原因，他的友好們：HG威爾斯，穆雷敎授，曼斯斐爾，潑萊斯里，A赫胥黎與熊式一等，各寫一篇紀念或硏究的文字，合出了一册專集，以示敬愛。</p>
<p>這老兒，其實並不老。雖則他是曾與維多利亞朝文人爲伍，身歴兩次世界大戰的現代文壇上碩果僅村的古董，有幾個人感覺到他的年紀的負擔。人們只覺得他是這一世紀的大文豪，曾經寫了兩部近代的傑作：「聖女貞德」和「人與超人」；却不道他的大部份生命已經化爲歷史了。曾經與他同代的作家羣中，有吉伯林·哈代·王爾德等。而當他第一部劇本（Rhinegold）出版時，坦納生與白朗寗也還在世。</p>
<p>蕭伯納生於愛爾蘭的杜勃林。父親是個頗具幽默感的酒徒；母親是個極有修養的歌唱家。家境淸寒，因此他最初的卅年一直是在窮困中過去的。終其一生，他是個未曾受過多少學校敎育的智者；可是他幾乎讀遍了地球上所有的名著。他愛音榮，因爲他母親是個極有修養的音樂家，使這些孩子們得以從小在貝多芬與享德爾樂曲中長大。</p>

<p>一八七六，蕭隨着家庭到倫敦。每天試着寫千餘字，苦苦寫了十年，完成了五個小說和幾百篇短文，然而一共只賣得六鎊。那幾年，他一直靠着他母親過活，藉此獲得寫作的餘暇。</p>
<p>從廿六歲起，他成了蔬食主義者——一半爲了人道主義，一半是爲了健康。他鄙視那些肉食者。據說有一次，曾因此而與嗜肉的大雕刻家羅丹互作議嘲。蕭不單是食慾的寡慾主義者，也是性慾的寡慾主義者，他是個淸敎徒。雖然也曾興當時紅女伶愛倫。黛麗鬧過一些書札上的戀愛把戲，她始終是忠誠地熱愛他的那位已於三年前亡故的夫人的。</p>
<p>一八八四，蕭加入了創立才一年的費邊學社，爲社會主義運動奔走街頭熱烈宣傳。三年以後，他又把對象從工人階級轉移到智識份子，他的鋒銳便捷的口才征服了好些人。</p>
<p>蕭翁不單是社會批評家，還是音樂與戲劇批評界的權威。他曾替好友哈立斯編的「週六許論」，寫了三年劇評。這是當時倫敦的一本高級讀物，其時蕭翁在文壇上的地位，也已經因其潑辣機雋的文筆而雄峙確立了。</p>
<p>蕭伯納的幽默詼諧是舉世皆知的，大家把他看作玩仳不恭的丑角。其實，他是個戴着小丑假臉的理想主義者。他自己自視爲時代的先知，是否如此，那就得讓時閒來作最後的判斷了。</p>
<p>但是，他的冷諷熱嘲僅是表面的形式，一時的工具——這却是眞的。他自己也曾說過：「假若不如此說說笑笑，怕沒有一個人會受得住的。」在這一個諷嘲的面具之下，是一顆愛爾蘭人熱血沸騰的赤心，是强烈的人間愛，是廣博的同情。他時時在替那些勞動的貧苦的人們設法改善境遇，也時時自掏腰包救濟他們。正如却斯特登所說：滑稽家往往是世上最嚴肅的人。在大庭廣衆之間，他固然口齒銳利，喜笑嘲屬雜作；私生活中，他却是個沉靜，友善，溫文的謙謙君子。</p>
<p>蕭翁今日已在文學史上奠定了輝皇的地位了，人們常將他與莎士比亞相比擬。（莎翁是他最敬仰的一人呢。）隨着榮譽而來的，當然也財富。劇本替蕭帶來了大宗錢財，若干年來，他是世界上收入長豐的劇作家；最近又成了代價最高的電影劇本寫作家。根據他的劇本編製電影，得從總收入內提出十分之一酬謝他·已攝成的有「賣花女」，「巴白拉上校」等片，最近又攝竣新片「凱撤與埃及女皇」。因此當某次英國方面想以最高褒獎授贈時，他竟乾脆拒絕了；他認爲蕭伯納這名字，再無須加以不必要的點綴。</p>
<p>蕭翁的重要劇本有下述數種：武器與人（初演於一八九四）。Candida（一八九四）。魔鬼的門徒（一八九七）。凱撤與埃及女皇（一八九八）。人與超人（一九〇三）初演於一九〇五年月。巴白拉少校（一九〇五，十一月）。以後他又曾寫了「賣花女」與最後的一個著名戲劇「聖女貞德」（一九二三）。並寫了多種經濟學名著。直到現在據說他還在寫一個劇本。</p>
<h3>蕭翁逸事</h3>
<p>— 槐</p>
<p>蕭伯納的詼諧是舉世聞名的。有一次一個漂亮的女伶（並不是舞蹈家鄧肯）寫信向他求婚。她說：「你的腦子加上我的身段，我們將產生最完美的孩子。」但是蕭回答：「倘若那孩子承襲了我的身段和你的腦子，怎麽辦呢？」</p>
<p>詼諧是詼諧了，可是大多數學者們，雖則很敬仰蕭的智憲的啓示，却並不怎麼欣賞他的小丑面目。這些人中間也有他自己在內。一晚，「武器與人「演完後，把蕭請出來以作者身份謝幕。在一陳熱烈掌聲的末尾，突然來了一聲冷冷的「噓」·蕭翁伸起雙手讓瘋狂的靈衆靜下來。然後旋轉身來向着倒彩的方向，說：「我很同意你，朋友。但是滿屋子人的意見恰跟我們相反，我和你二人又有什麽辦法呢？」</p>
<p>一九二五年，他曾拒絕諾貝爾文學獎金。他拒絕的理由極有意思：他並不需要這筆錢。這錢大約合美金三萬五千元，他說：「宛如救命圈之於已經安全渡登彼岸的游泳者，毫無用處。」</p>

<h3>蕭翁日常生活</h3>
<p>— 琳</p>
<p>蕭伯納在Ayot，St．Lawrence有座三層樓的別墅，有着十二個舒適的房間。四　園子佔地廣一百畝。他便平靜優閒地住在這裏面，度着他的寫作生活。他不吸烟，不吃葷，每天早晨九時進早餐，讀新聞紙——從頑固的倫敦時報讀到共產黨的「每日工人」。於是躱入他的工作小屋裏面，寫作到一時。飯後午睡片刻；四時許再回到小屋去。直到七時吃晚飯。在晚上，他讀書聽無綫電，十一時入睡。</p>
<p>他的夫人夏綠蒂·唐Charlotte　Paylle　Townshend已於三年前逝世。現在他只是獨個兒住在Ayot，僱有車夫·園丁·管家及女傭各一人。每年七月，他必到倫敦去住些時，讓傭僕們可以有個休息，烟突等等也可掃除一次。</p>
<h3>蕭翁壽辰獻辭</h3>
<p>— 英·穆雷教授作　藍甯譯</p>
<p>我病着·可是對我如此敬仰的GBS，我不能給遺漏在一羣紀念者的外面。</p>
<p>讓我重提一句舊時的題辭。在我論亞里士多芬斯一書中，我寫着：「獻給我的老友GBS，一個愛好理想，憎恨殘暴，曾以歡笑充塞世界，而勇氣從不消失的人——」</p>
<p>「愛好理想」，雖然我曾與許多文化工作者相處，我懷疑有幾個像他這樣强烈地度着精神生活，而很少顧到肉體方面的人。他把飲食的享受看得驚人的輕。粗鄙與肉慾是不見於他的洋溢的雋智中的。甚至創痛似乎也不能怎樣騷擾他。有一次，他受傷甚重，遍體包紮，折骨，流了很多血。我去看他，總以爲他是躺在床上，却不道吿訴我正在園裏高岡上。我進去不見一人、只是淸晰地聽得從一叢冬靑樹後傳來陣陣笑聲。循着聲音找到了他。他沒有注意我的到來，沒有注意他自己的創痛，用沒有包紮的手正在書寫，一面快樂地放聲歡笑。</p>
<p>甚至作爲改革者看，使他感到興趣的也是理想。雖則他正視並洞悉世故人事，我想，他的激動，主要的並非是爲了對人類苦難的同情，却更多是爲了造成這些苦難的荒謬，設施。他用嘲笑與冰冷的邏輯改革，勝似訴之於感情。</p>
<p>當然也不能忘了他極端的「憎恨殘暴」，憎恨無論對人的或是對畜牲的殘暴行爲。他似乎是並不屬於我們這嗜一肉種族的。這一種族一生主要樂趣是我們之所謂「運動」，亦即「打獵」，「射獵」和「釣魚」，常以死亡與創痛加之於幾乎每一樣能生活能感覺的生物身」。同樣地，他憎恨人性的壓抑；並非他特別喜歡兎中城狐狸或是窮人。只是他不忍看他們被苛待。</p>
<p>褒到他的「歡笑充塞世界，」這是太易於瞭解了，但有兩點値得注意。第一，我懷疑人類史上是否曾有過像他如此偉大的智者，諷刺家而絕不挾嫌惡意攻　私人的。他會對着他以爲殘忍或不公平的的行爲或設施猛烈抨擊。然而從不涉及私人。像一般次一流的諷刺家，或甚至偉大的前輩伏爾奉與亞里士多芬斯那末地傷害他人，他從來想也沒想到。不過，他與這二人一樣，有着許多諷刺家所缺少的偉大氣資，他對詩，畫，音，樂，的傑作懷着眞正的尊重與欣賞。在同代學者中，若論莎士比亞硏究，很少有幾個比他有更深切的知識的。他總是注意着同代的天才，（不是　羨或嫉妬）；他曾爲托爾斯泰，易卜生，梅特林克，羅丹而欣喜。對於年靑的英國作家，他孜孜不倦地給予帮助。</p>
<p>他的「勇氣從不消失。」我不是單指他無畏地攻擊一切事有特權與權威的固有信念或設施·他抨擊保守主義和過邀言義，迷信和科學，只要他認爲什麼時候那一樣過於擅權攬勢，他便不顧一切地抨擊。他更有一種稀有的氣資：天才的勇氣，或者我竟可名之爲天才的固執。我還記得當他最初的戲劇出版時，每一個人以爲是無法搬上舞臺的。戲院經理們和易地說他很有一點戲劇的天才；只要他能改動他的晦澀的劇本，或是找個才思敏捷然知戲院情形的作家幫他改寫一番，它們也許是頗値得演出的·但是二十年後，他終於堅毅地寫出了一本有人敢於演出的劇本—「武器與人」·立刻得到了成功，以後沒有多久，蕭獲得了現在的地位，成了歐洲最著名讀者最廣戲劇家。</p>
<p>在所有他的驚人才華之外，他是最和藹慷慨的一人·我將不稱他是最聰敏的人·他在實務上的天才不是建設設性的，面是分析的。有次他在「週六評諭」上爲自己的幾個作品辯護，大胆地寫道：「我是什麽人，應該公正不偏？」這是個坦白的辯護。評衡爭執的因素，審愼綜合後指出一條妥善的路，這不是他的職務。官吏和執政者可以幹這些。蕭的職務是指出那些錯誤的然而不被人知的事情；有時甚至不惜出之以誇張或偏激的筆調，這着人們正視那些不能見到或不願見到的事情。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　70</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我從來不知道什麽叫作忙，什麼叫作累，可是在我們這通縣臨時行動總部辦公室內，別的不說，只看那人員紛紛退出，報吿，指揮，派遣；又聽那電話的丁伶伶聲，和隔室傳過來，隱隱約約，秘密電機的打打茲打聲，響個不住，那隊長，一手握着耳機，一手接電訊，口發命令，眼睛翻閱報吿；這一切等等，就是坐在那裏不管閒事，僅祗聽聽看看，也要覺得頭暈腦悶，眼花耳鳴了。</p>
<p>那位北平來的頭目，現在已在第十二團中，就任了臨時作戰參謀長，實際就是監視僞自治軍，怕有越軌行動。我一方面在辦公室助理隊畏辦事，一方面還同虎第擔任着發動以後的外勤聯絡工作。這點職責，聽來好像輕鬆平常，可祗要閉目幻想一下，那時城內城外，兵馬奔騰，槍砲震天，子彈亂飛，人聲喧嚷，整個城市，一殺就要變成一鍋翻騰濺瀑的沸水一般，你還得在這個紛亂沸騰之中，往來料理各方進行情形，收發報吿，決斷問題；一個不對，也許還要搯出槍來激鬥一陣。如此想來，我們的職務，並不十分輕鬆哩。</p>
<p>虎弟同我一樣，穿着「保安隊」的制服，所不同一點，他剃的是一個光光的和尙頭，我則仍舊剪的男裝髮。這時候他在辦公室裘閒着無事可做，閉着一隻眼打瞌睡，那睜開的一隻眼睛，大概就爲的要留意瞧着，怕我們出動的時候，把他扔下了。因爲嫁長好幾次逗着他玩，說他年紀太小，幹起工作來，怕鎭壓人不住。背地裏却是誇贊得他無所不能。</p>
<p>事務忙碌的時候，時間過得極快，一晃就到了三點多鐘。隊長看見大家都有些困倦，便喚勤務來，吩咐開了幾瓶酒，拿出些現成的罐頭，和餅乾點心之類，讓大家醒醒困，同時也大家「乾一杯」，來預慶勝利成功。頭一個驚動起來的就是虎弟，那閉着的一隻眼睛，立時睜開了。</p>
<p>還有一件關於虎弟的事，似乎應當插在這裏報吿一下，虎弟自到通縣以來，比以前要沉默得多。從前，大庭廣衆之前，他固然不大多插嘴發言，除非他覺得這句話，非說不可，才肯開口；可是同我單獨在一起的時候，他可也不怎麼緘默，而且很瑣碎，有些像老太婆的勢　叨叨。這兩天却有些變樣，就是同我在一起，也不說話；不問，不答；好像有挺大的心事。</p>
<p>昨天尤其特別，一早起來，就問我要一百塊錢，說是碰見了一個寨子附近裏的人動身回家，他要託那人捐幾個錢給媽。這個數目相當的大，（從前要錢，最多一元爲限，剃頭洗澡，買點零嘴；）這還不去說　，並且當時我就證明他在說假話，因他一說假話，那雙大圓眼睛，至少要連着　閉三四下，這是百試不爽的。我並非不能立時扎穿他這個　泡泡，可是我一時好奇，想看他究竟在搗什麽鬼。</p>
<p>他拿了錢，立刻笑容滿面，東扯西拉，硬　出些話來逗笑；又向我討了兩小時的假，（因爲在公事上，他是我的助手，算我的屬員，出外必得向我請假。）我　索性很爽快答應了他，只囑咐他快去快　，別躭悮了公事。我本來打算暗地吊他的綫，看他究竟上那兒去，無奈磁巧隊畏找我說話，一時不得閒，竟讓虎弟溜了　。他倒是兩小時不到就回來了，我也懶得追問了；因問也無益，知道他早準預備了一套話來對付我；那又何必多此一舉呢？</p>
<p>這兩天這等忙亂，我却無時不留心他的舉動。除了過分沉默之外，他還時時在霎眼睛，好像在思索什麼。就這時候，在辦公室裏，他雖說坐在屋角一隻軟椅上，閉着一隻跟在休息，我想他不一定睡熟，一定是在那裏盤算什麽。</p>

<p>市長妙</p>
<p>吳市長的汽車夫忽視紅燈，警察先阻後放，但市長却派秘書到警察分局去，下令對他目己予以破壞交通規則的處分。大陸報社評說：</p>
<p>『有時，吳國楨市長會用極微妙的方法來表現他的思想……』</p>
<p>我認爲市長還做得不道地，除下令暨分自己違反交通規則外，還應該處分那位先阻後放的徇私的交通警察。</p>

<h3>富貴之道</h3>
<p>— S·S</p>
<p>人·情·世·故</p>
<p>不知道是否上帝和人類故意開玩笑？抑或是要爲這大千世界平添許多驚險離奇的花樣？所以目有史以來，任何一個地方都是窮人多於富人；單是窮人多倒並不稀奇，妙却妙在也放幾個亦富亦貴的人點綴其問，於是這擾擾　寰，窮人們都有了生活的目標，向上爬的目標；整日爬，年年爬，等到爬不動躺下來爲止。眼見熙來攘往，塵迷中道，爬起跌倒，跌倒再爬，賞心悅目，煞是好看！</p>
<p>窮人們經過幾千年爬下來的意會言傳，漸漸地也有了一點心得和經騐了。他們懂得了事牛功倍的爬法。這樣行之既久，你就可以喘一口氣，伸一伸腰，洗凈泥汚，昻苜做人。你千萬不能在爬的時候想到在人家脚跟前的猥鄙與可憐，你應該記住這樣爬法是祖宗們一代一代辛辛苦苦地遺留下來的敎條，做子孫的必需克紹箕表，發掦光大。</p>
<p>窮人身上都有一股酸氣，這是在爬向富貴人面前去的時候的一個最大障礙；所以你就應該有自知之明，儘管藍袍于裝，要出落得笑靨迎人，談吐要溫存諂媚，而又要不落窠臼；警如你要是知道你所迎拍的主子是個遜淸遺老，地方士紳，那你就應該在捧着水煙袋承同意旨的時候，痛駡科學，惡詆人心，但你却不能過分否定科學和人心，因爲老太爺們是很淸楚這次東洋人確確實實敗在在原子炸彈上面的；假使你的主子是相信祖宗都是從歐羅巴洲或是阿美利加移民過來的人物，那你就應該誇說阿爾卑斯山較之中國西北幾個土堆要如何的壯麗，强調密西瑟比河較之中國東南幾條泥溝要雄偉多多；在你們談話的當兒，倘若主子的令郞令嫒「約翰」「小瑪利亞」拿着配給食盒在吃，這又是一個再妙沒有的機會；你可以從人家外國怎樣對國民營養重視而合理贊嘆不絕起首，再分析這次戰爭中我們所表現出來的無知，貧弱和窮相，而把結論歸根到描繪人家已將剩餘物資投入海裏的豪華塲面上去；你這邊吠影吠聲，聳肩作態，主子們也一定搖頭幌腦，微笑不語，然後當他默思有頃，拍拍你的肩說：「老弟眞是解人！」你要不慌不忙，俯首帖耳，表示得逢伯樂，死而無憾，願常聽驅策，或是結草啣環！</p>
<p>等而下之，你假使碰着一個曾做過漢奸，而現在猶在某處高踞一人之下，數百萬人之上的主子，你切莫吿訴他：某某從前和他同列過廟堂的摯友已被明正典刑的消息：如果你有一個以「國難財」「勝利財」「接收財」暴發起家，因長袖善舞而倖免淸査的主子，你要對他解釋：儻來之財，原是取之無傷廉惠的道理；倘若你再遭逢到一個和你一樣剛爬上來不久的主子，你更應該對他的「爬法」表示心領神悟，五體投地，聲述「我是天生賤相，無法高攀，」恭維他能够扶披後進，實在是長者風度，仁者用心你要不疾不徐地順着他們的脚跟爬，不輕不重地在他們的　處拍，然後：主子們對你會引爲生死之交，同華們把你當做奴胚狗才，下面還有一羣也跟着你屁股後面拍的人節直把你視爲「畢生楷範，」那麽你纔可以算是爬上一級了。</p>
<p>你在既經爬上去以後，雖然距離大富大貴的標準尙遠，但亦不妨稍仆小憩，鬆弛一下你那爬得精疲力盡的神抓；這時候你可以向那些跟在後面循着你的脚跟爬上米的後輩，以及向在「爬的行列」中掙扎川來的朋儕們吹牛一番一；對前者要擺出像煞有介事的尊嚴來向他們講解「爬的哲學」之精與與深微，對後者則應把「胡適之是我的朋友」的邏輯宣掦一頓，尤其要把你的歴任主子介紹出來，說明這都是親戚故舊，鄉椊同年；他們對你的大放厥辭，雖感到氣勢凌人，但亦無可如何，依然要表示我不如也，崇敬備至；這樣你可以一步一步的離開那窮的圈子了。不過你還要留意時機，尋找更富貴的主子一獻往日身手，迎拍如儀，拍好就爬，爬上去再吹，吹得四面八方，翕然景從，結果爬上「名流」寳座，你不妨再忙裏偸閒，喊兩聲「富貴於我如浮雲」的高調，哼幾句「感時惜福」的低調，包管一唱百和，千古留芳！</p>
<p>「爬」的哲學如此，在下不吝公開，大千世界，苦海無邊，窮人太多，回頭是岸，願一起來爬，同登極樂！阿彌陀佛。</p>
<h3>嘉·言</h3>
<p>— 洪果</p>
<p>有兩種財產萬不可任意浪費；一個是身體，一個是時間，學問之增進，，業之成收，均繫於此！</p>
<p>總明是一種東西，它常常和懶惰混在一起。</p>
<p>求愛與借窮，是人生兩火難題，（但只要不是濫來，則鼓起勇氣可也。</p>
<p>要做一個强者，不要做一個弱者；所謂强，是强在能够管理自己，控制自己，主宰自己。並且知道；實行一個格言，比說了一百個格言要强得多。</p>
<h3>準洋人</h3>
<p>— 璧君</p>
<p>上海某敎會大學裏，九百多學生中，十分之九是中國人，十分之一是外籍學生，在十分之九的中國學生裏，却有少數是滿嘴外國話，穿外國衣服，叫外國名字，故等於長得外國人容貌的中國人，這一類學生，他們決不能滿足做中國人的條件，但是他們却自稱是中國人！</p>
<p>中國人雖然不見得都認識中國字，但是無論如何中國人一定要會說中國話，（除非啞吧）尤其是在中國的最高學府裏，竟能發現不認識本國字的學生，眞是够可恥的了，這一羣不能說本國話的中國學生，簡直是不要臉，本來在該學校裏一年級原有「中文」課程，但是他們却和眞外籍學生同樣地免修了，的確，他們和外國人無甚差別；說外國話，長得外國模樣，甚至於有在馬達加斯加，哥多……的出生證，他們生在外國的環境裏，說着外國話，受着外國人的保護，所進的學校也是外國人所管制的，在學校裘受着和中國人不一樣的待遇，若是你偶然地和他談一會，他竟會不帶羞澀地用外國話吿訴你：「我也是中國人』。</p>
<p>他們在學校裏受着優待，因爲學校的主事人是外國人，他們可以不交學費，可以不花錢吃飯。這些不明國籍學生的在校消費完全由中國學生的學費來彌補，這些半洋人興奮時的拳頭，也是由中國學生來接受。他們明明是看不起中國人，但是卻時常用言語表示他是中國人！</p>
<p>看到國外僑胞學校被當局禁敎華語，僑胞等憤慨呼籲，又看到這些「準洋人」的奴隸成性，眞令我欲哭無淚，欲笑不得！</p>

<h3>烏龜大王</h3>
<p>— 郁強</p>
<p>職業不論高低大小，祗要經營得法，就會「行行出狀元」。紐約百老滙有兄弟兩人—愛爾·高爾德和司丹東·高爾德—以出售彩繪的烏龜致富，可說是三百六十行之外的「狀元」了。</p>
<p>八年前，高爾德兄弟開始了這個新奇的買賣，經過了幾年的慘澹經營，生意發達，他們己成爲「硬殼產品」的批發商，美國各地的禮物店和一角商店都經營這種新奇的小玩意。除了百老滙的老店，他們又在曼哈丹的市中區增設了好幾家支店。</p>
<p>這種「硬穀產品」是繪着各種彩色的烏龜，有懷錶那樣大小，平均每隻售價美金四毛半。顧客可以選一個名字或幾句話用不能抹掉的墨水刻在龜背上。有的人刻上女朋友的名字有的用做生日或結婚的禮物，有的做廣吿用或陳列用，甚至有人用做求婚。</p>
<p>好萊塢名歌星平克勞斯貝曾替他的四個孩子定了一批「硬殼產品」。秀蘭鄧波兒，迪安娜　萍和其他的好萊塢明星對這種小玩意都很愛好，甚至嚴肅的卓別林也未能「免俗」。英國前首相張伯倫曾郵購過五十隻，分贈給他的孫子。裝烏龜的郵包是一種特製的盒子，開着通氣的洞，裏面墊着潮濕的苔蘚。</p>
<p>買這種爬行緩慢的動物有許多的理由，做父母的常買兩個較大的烏龜帶回家去塗給孩子·一星期後，他們再買一個較小的，當晚上孩子入睡後，便們便把小烏龜的放在它的「雙親」一起。第二天早晨孩子們發現了這個「奇蹟」便高聲歡呼起來，說小烏龜是「仙鶴」帶來的·</p>
<p>有些人相信烏龜能帶來好運道，便爲「好運道」買了一隻，還有一些懶於覆信而覺得過意不去的人，便寄去一隻烏龜，背上題語道：「我覆信和這個傢伙一樣的慢」。</p>
<p>高爾德兄弟的最辛述的顧客，是一個有兩個孩子的父親。他買了三隻烏龜，得了一筆橫財。他將兩個孩子的名字分別刻在兩個烏龜上，另一隻刻上他家的闊朋友娜娜的名字。後來娜娜拜訪他家，看見了她的「同名者」，她被友誼的舉止感動了，就拿出一筆錢來做兩個孩子的敎育基金。</p>
<p>高爾德兄弟在路易西安那州的兩個城鎭設有烏龜養殖塲。每週運抵紐約的烏龜大約有一萬五千隻，都成排的擺在箱子內，裏面塞着苔蘚，其中大部份都是從路易西安那州來的。到達紐約後，烏龜就被放在大桶裏，等候「製造」。第一步，在烏龜的甲彀上塗一層保護的白色。然後這小東西就一打一串的被碼尺挾起來，同時由一個嫺熟的女工用刷子將它們刷擦一番，隨後就把它門放到架于上去晒乾。其次是望上一層厚的琺瑯—紅，黃和藍是三種最流行的顏色。</p>
<p>假如烏龜是大的，它便適於誕辰或婚禮之川。烏龜經選擇後就在它的背上用特種顏料給上適當的圖畫。「完工」了的烏龜就陳列在部份充水的桶水裏—桶裏的水，冬天是喛的，以防冬蟄；夏天是涼的，用以「袪暑」。</p>
<p>高爾德兄弟出售一種特別的烏龜食料，內含乾的螞蟻蛋和乾的蒼蠅，前者來自芬蘭，後者來自墨西哥。</p>
<p>高爾德兄弟還帶賣另外一種新奇的東西，就是：小的美洲短吻　魚。但是，「烏龜大王」抱寃着說：短吻　魚不大容茹馴服，也不易常年獲得，而且又沒有多大吸人的魔力。所以，從生意的立塲面言，高爾德兄弟所喜愛的還是烏龜。</p>

<h3>黨國瓌寶·白頭少年　風趣的吳稚老（上）</h3>
<p>— 疾風</p>
<p>大家都熟悉這位孤高而風趣的吳稚輝老先生，國府高級官史就職時，他是老牌的監羣員，例有訓話，在莊嚴中夾着幾句俏皮話。本月十五日本市市黨部新主委方治氏宣誓就職，監誓員也正是這位年己八十一歲的吳老先生。最近吳氏還在滬主特國語推行委員會。（見十六日本報）</p>
<p>道德文章</p>
<p>吳氏爲國民黨元老，道德文章，冠冕當代。蔣主席尊之爲「黨國　寶」，馮玉祥會稱他做「白頭少年」，胡適更譽爲」近三百年大思想家之一」。其秉性極孤高，努力克已，生平嘗以不做官，不乘人力車，不用奴僕爲立身的準繩。在重慶時，常常穿着敝舊的布衣服，拿着手杖，在路上若其的來走去。他所住的那座「抗戰房子」，薄薄的瓦片，竹紥的屋架子，將是用竹和砌的，陳設很簡單，屋內僅可容數人。</p>
<p>改名敬恒</p>
<p>吳氏原爲武進雪堰橋人，他少年時候，到陽湖縣（屬常州府）應童子試，因爲口音像無錫人，同考的人疑心他是冒籍，羣起毆之，因此吳稚老恨極，就終身自認爲無錫人。光緒十七年，中了舉人。但他對封建思想，極爲反對，有一次，吳氏宗族修譜，他不贊成，憤憤地把字盤全都傾翻，因此大遭族長及公親的忌恨，不得已逃出故鄉。光緒二十四年，在上海任南洋公學校長，與元和陳　治，共約不復讀綫裝書，又以缺敬與，不足任天下之重」，於是改名爲敬恒·</p>
<p>民國十年，任里昂中法大學副校長，率領一班學生出洋，一日，吳氏在船上拾到一條子，親自把他洗乾，然後出了一張佈告：『地上拾到一條臭　褲子，已代洗凈，是那一個的？請資領回。』有時候，學生們將瓜子果殼，隨地亂拋，吳氏也親執箕帚，去　乾凈。</p>

<h3>Myriad Lights, Hanging Flags Celebrate Chairman's Inspection of Taipei Harbor, and Offering Flowers to Martyrs and Koxinga</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Chen, departed from the headquarters at 3:15 PM on the 22nd, heading to the Taipei Martyrs' Shrine to offer flowers and pay respects to revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, as well as the late Ming Prince of Yanping, Koxinga. En route from Grass Mountain to Beitou (both in the northern suburbs of the city), the Chairman and his wife stopped their car halfway up the mountainside, gazing at the panoramic view of Taipei. After paying respects at the Martyrs' Shrine, they inspected both wings for five minutes before heading to Tamsui, arriving at 4:05 PM. After refreshments, the Chairman visited the fort ruins and posed for photos with Governor Chen. He then ascended the platform, gazing towards the distant ocean for a long time. After the inspection, he and his wife planted a camphor tree each nearby. Tamsui was once an important harbor in northern Taiwan. In the late Ming Dynasty, the Dutch occupied the island by building Fort Santo Domingo there. In 1661, Koxinga launched an expedition and conquered it, landing here. The site of Fort Santo Domingo remains visible to this day. At 5:05 PM, he inspected Tamsui High School, where the students cheered "Long live the Chairman!" The Chairman repeatedly nodded and said, "Good, good, thank you, thank you." As evening approached, he returned to headquarters to rest. Along the way, residents hung flags to celebrate, with men, women, and children standing at their doorsteps in the myriad lights of their homes to pay their respects. Furthermore, very few people knew about Chairman Chiang's visit to Taiwan beforehand. Yesterday, when the Chairman's car passed through the city, some elderly women, upon seeing him, were moved to tears of joy. This morning, after citizens learned of this news, businesses and residents voluntarily hung flags, instantly enlivening the streets.</p>
<h3>Intermediaries Mediate for Days, Suggesting First to Stop Propaganda War</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The tea party at Sun Ke's residence this evening lasted from 8:00 PM to 11:10 PM. All attendees except the Communist representatives were present, and various issues were seriously discussed. Afterward, Mr. Sun met with reporters, stating that the Communist representatives and third-party figures had arrived in Nanjing two days ago and were still exchanging views. The third party heard discussions, conveyed opinions from both the Communist and government sides, and then decided on a meeting format. Formal negotiations have not yet begun. What can be announced today is that one of the third party's opinions has been accepted by the government, namely that propaganda from both the government and the Communist Party should be taken seriously and a "propaganda truce" should be implemented immediately. Any documents and speeches that must be published in the future must be approved by everyone. This is a new restriction. After the meeting, Liang Shuming, Luo Longji from the China Democratic League, Mo Dehui, a socially prominent person, and Chen Qitian from the China Youth Party went to Meiyuan New Village to visit Zhou Enlai, returning to Lan Jia Zhuang at 12:00 AM and holding a temporary press conference. Mr. Liang announced the progress of today's talks, saying that the third party's opinions on a ceasefire, discussed with representatives from all parties today, have been recorded and transmitted to the government. The gathering at 8:00 PM was arranged by the third party to explain this to the government representatives, which took a long time. Everyone believes that things can still progress and that there is no need to be pessimistic. However, the most important thing at present is that neither side's propaganda should be excessive, so as not to affect the progress of negotiations. Starting on the 23rd, the third party will invite both the Kuomintang and Communist parties to begin discussing the implementation of a cessation of propaganda offensives. Those who cherish peace will surely pay attention to this matter. Finally, Mr. Liang solemnly stated the third party's declaration as follows: "Informal discussions have been actively underway for days, and all reports of disputes and statements made by each other do not affect the negotiations. Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 23rd, the third party will invite representatives from both sides to discuss ways to cease propaganda warfare."</p>

Zhou Enlai then stood up and said, "I didn't study science, but I had excellent grades in mathematics in middle school. I believe that small details should be clarified. For example, X plus Y equals four. If you don't clarify what X is and how much Y is, how do you know where the four comes from?

LaGuardia stated: "Chinese ports that can handle relief supplies can request these supplies and they will be shipped." LaGuardia's announcement stated: "The speed of distribution of supplies in Chinese ports has greatly improved... The embargo on supplies to China is hereby lifted, and supplies will be shipped out according to the capacity of Chinese ports, upon request of the respective ports." LaGuardia said: "Ships will depart as soon as the current labor strike is resolved." He also said that the report on the improved speed of distribution of supplies in Chinese ports came from Major General Edgerton, Director of UNRRA's China Office. The announcement was only seventy-three words long and did not explain the detailed plan.</p>
<p>[Our City News] A spokesman for the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) recently issued a statement on the UNRRA Director-General LaGuardia's announcement of the partial lifting of the suspension order on supplies to China, saying: "The UNRRA's announcement of the partial lifting of the suspension order is the result of months of continuous efforts by this Administration to clear out supplies." "In terms of the current distribution of supplies by this Administration, UNRRA urgently needs to fully resume the transportation of supplies to China, otherwise it will be difficult to coordinate with the future work of this Administration." It also said: "Since UNRRA announced the suspension order in July of this year, the quantity of supplies distributed by this Administration to various places has increased significantly each month. In July, this Administration shipped 45,000 tons of supplies to other ports, which increased to 68,000 tons in August, and 96,000 tons in September, totaling 120,000 tons including supplies distributed in Shanghai." "This Administration's distribution of supplies is constantly increasing, but UNRRA's transportation has been slow. Taking the recent week of October 5th to 11th as an example, this Administration distributed and shipped a total of 21,958 tons of supplies in Shanghai and to other ports. During the same week, only 14,683 tons of UNRRA supplies were unloaded in Shanghai." "Currently, there are still 115,000 tons of supplies in Shanghai warehouses, of which 65,000 tons need to be processed and modified in Shanghai, so only 50,000 tons of supplies can be shipped to other ports for distribution. Adding the 50,000 tons that UNRRA is scheduled to ship to China in the next two months, the total is only 100,000 tons. During the same period, this Administration's transportation volume can reach 240,000 tons." "I once consulted experts on UNRRA's resumption of transportation, and they all said that even if UNRRA immediately implements a full resumption of transportation, it will take three months to see results."</p>
<p>[Our City News] According to the China News Agency's Eastern Dispatch: Recently, 28 UNRRA giant ships, fully loaded with supplies, are sailing to Shanghai and will arrive soon.</p>
<h3>British Communist Party Member of Parliament Inquires in the House of Commons About UNRRA's Relief Plan for China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Labor Party Member of Parliament Williams inquired in the House of Commons: "After UNRRA ceases its activities, what is the plan for relief work in China? What agency will take over this work? How will the experience of UNRRA's work in China be considered, so that past mistakes are not repeated?" Undersecretary McNeil replied: "UNRRA's plan in China will not be completed until the fall of 1947 at the earliest. In August, the UNRRA General Assembly held in Geneva passed a resolution to submit the question of whether countries still need relief after UNRRA ceases its work to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. Therefore, the General Assembly should decide how to handle relief work. Before making a decision, it should first examine whether the countries still need external assistance in addition to loans from international banks. This question is related to the balance of payments of the countries and cannot be accurately estimated in advance, nor is it within the scope of UNRRA's post-disaster relief." "As for the experience gained by UNRRA, it should be provided to any agency that undertakes relief work in China. It is reported that UNRRA has set up a commissioner to record the activities in China in detail, which will be a very valuable record."</p>
<h3>He Fengshan Reports on Overseas Chinese Affairs: Rice Has Been Allocated to Aid Refugees Who Escaped from the Dutch East Indies; Overseas Chinese Who Illegally Entered the Philippines Have Been Properly Sent Back to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] In order to understand the recent situation of our country's protection of overseas Chinese, the reporter specially visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He Fengshan, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry, received the reporter and answered the questions as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) It was reported a few days ago that more than 2,000 overseas Chinese, fleeing from the disaster-stricken area of the Dutch East Indies near Panipagan, sought refuge on Gedang Island in British Malaya, and Consul Xu Menghong, stationed in Kuala Lumpur, discussed relief matters. How is this matter progressing? (Answer) When Consul Xu learned that the aforementioned refugees had arrived on Gedang Island under his jurisdiction, he requested 600 dan (石) of low-priced rice from the local government for relief. Although the supply of rice in Malaya is currently very difficult, with the assistance of the provincial governor, the welfare department has allocated the full amount for emergency use. Consul Xu is now trying to transport another 50 tons of rice to Bagan Siapiapi in Sumatra to relieve the refugees there, and is contacting overseas Chinese groups to launch fundraising for disaster relief.</p>
<p>(Question) It is rumored that dozens of overseas Chinese were arrested by the Philippine authorities for illegal entry. What is the process and how did our government handle it? (Answer) Recently, more than 60 people from southern Fujian took two steamships and sailed from Taiwan to northern Luzon, illegally entering the country. They were all captured by the Philippine Constabulary and escorted to Manila. After receiving the report, we have asked the Philippine authorities to properly send them back to China. After investigation, it was found that these two groups of passengers were deceived. The shipowners have offices in Xiamen and Taiwan, advertising to recruit passengers, claiming to send them to the Philippines for 150,000 yuan per person, which led to the passengers being deceived and suffering mental and financial losses, and affecting the long-standing reputation of our overseas Chinese in the Philippines. Now the Ministry has consulted with relevant agencies to severely punish the shipowners.</p>

<h3>Academia Sinica Council Meeting Discusses Work Guidelines; Passes "Academician" Title and Stipulates Quotas</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The second session of the third annual meeting of the Academia Sinica Council was held in the auditorium of the Academia Sinica on the 22nd. Twenty-eight council members, including Zhu Jiahua, Wang Shijie, Weng Wenhao, Bingzhi, Hu Shi, and Fu Sinian, attended the meeting. The meeting was chaired by Zhu Jiahua, the chairman of the council. The general work guidelines and the allocation of funds were discussed. Wu Youxun, Hu Shi, and Fu Sinian believed that the Academia Sinica had not yet achieved the ideal in terms of the concentration of talent. Mao Yisheng said: "The Academia Sinica itself is a research institution. On the one hand, it should enrich research work. On the other hand, it should be responsible for guiding the research work of academic institutions across the country." Hu Shi also suggested merging research institutes with similar properties to reduce units, concentrate manpower, and make it easier to show work performance. After the break, the meeting was resumed to review the work reports of the research institutes. In order to save time, Fu Sinian, Wu Youxun, Zhu Jingxi, Hu Xianqin, Mao Yisheng, Li Shuhua, and Zhu Kezhen were selected as members of the committee, with Fu Sinian as the convener. The meeting was adjourned at 12 noon. The meeting was held at 3 pm to discuss "the proposal to stipulate the name, establishment, election and related matters of Member acadimia sinica". Regarding the name of Member of acadima sinica, the council members expressed their opinions, including "Academician", "Yuan Ru (院儒)", "Yuan Lü (院侶)", "Yuan Zheng (院正)", "Yuan Yuan (院員)", and "Member", etc. As a result, the name "Academician" was passed, because among the 22 council members present at that time, 13 people expressed their support for using it. Another important proposal: "Please set up the Academician of the Academia Sinica and revise the organization and mission of the Council", it was decided that the quota of academicians will be 80 to 100 people in the first phase, and up to 10 people will be elected each year thereafter. In the future, the Council will be formed by the election of council members from the academicians. This resolution has been formed into a review committee by Hu Shi, Fu Sinian, Li Shuhua, Wu Youxun, Sa Bendong, Bing Zhi, and Chen Heng, and Hu Shi was elected as the convener.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The annual meeting of the Academia Sinica Council will hold a group review meeting on the morning of the 23rd. The first group will review the work reports of the research institutes, and the second group will discuss the establishment, election and related matters of academicians.

<h3>Guangdong Provincial Assembly Passes the Provincial Budget</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd] After fierce debate this morning, the Guangdong Provincial Assembly passed the provincial government's proposed provincial revenue and expenditure budget for the second half of the 35th year of the Republic of China.

<h3>Restoration Work of the Palace Museum is Not Yet Completed</h3>
<p>Ma Heng Talks in Nanjing</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Ma Heng, Director of the National Palace Museum, came to Nanjing to attend the board meeting of the Palace Museum. The reporter specially interviewed him. He said: "The restoration work of the Palace Museum has not yet been completed. In Beiping, the museum received the bronze collection of German expatriate Yang Ningshi. The oldest items are from the Shang Dynasty, and there are also unearthed objects from Anyang, Henan. Before the war, the excavation work in Anyang was the responsibility of the Academia Sinica. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Anyang fell into the hands of the enemy. The people excavated on their own. Occasionally, they would take the findings to Beiping for sale, all of which were collected by Yang Ningshi. Therefore, both the quantity and quality are very impressive. In addition, Guo Shiwu, a porcelain collector in Beiping, who was also the designer of the Hongxian Kiln during the Yuan Shikai era, left a will when he passed away, wishing to donate his entire collection to the National Government. At that time, the enemy and puppets tried every means to seize it, but Guo's descendants preserved it until today, which was not easy. After the recovery, it was received by the Palace Museum. The museum has set up special rooms to display these bronzes and porcelains, which will be open to the public from October 10th." When asked about the relics of Luo Zhenyu of the puppet Manchukuo government, Ma said: "Luo had sent all his collections to the puppet Zhangchun Museum before his death, and the books were stored in Luo's residence in Lushun. They were all lost when the Soviet army entered the Northeast, which is a pity."</p>
<h3>Ministry of National Defense Military Law Department Executes Three Military Criminals; Two are Traitors and One Embezzled Public Property</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense executed two military traitors, Li Ou Yi and Dong Xiutian, and a military officer, Wang Zhongmin, who embezzled public property. Li Ou Yi was originally a major general staff officer of the 5th Guerrilla Area Command in Guangdong. In November of the 28th year of the Republic of China, he was summoned to Nanjing by the enemy and successively served as the education director of the Guangzhou branch of the puppet Central Military Academy, and the lieutenant general director of the puppet Military Affairs Commission's office, and the commander of the puppet capital garrison and concurrently the police chief. Dong Xiutian once served as the company commander of the 735th regiment of the 45th brigade of the army. In October of the 27th year of the Republic of China, he was captured by the enemy and puppets in Suzhou, and then served the enemy, successively serving as the captain, battalion commander, adjutant, and regimental commander of the 1st and 2nd District Command of the puppet Zhejiang Pacification. Wang Zhongmin was the colonel warehouse director of the 33rd warehouse of the former Ministry of Military and Political Affairs in Suzhou. In March and April of this year, he took the liberty of handing over 109 bags of white sugar (each bag weighing 150 kilograms) stored in the warehouse to Fu Ziben, the captain adjutant of the Suzhou POW Management Office of the Third Theater Command, who introduced it to the merchant Wang Mingjie, and obtained more than 6 million yuan, which was divided for spending. The matter was discovered by the former Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, and Wang Zhongmin and Fu Ziben were detained and interrogated. After interrogating and confirming that the above was true, Wang Zhongmin was sentenced to death for embezzling public property, and Fu Ziben was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and four years of deprivation of civil rights for helping others to embezzle public property.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Wishing the United Nations General Assembly Success</h3>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly opens in New York today. Politicians and diplomats from fifty-one countries around the world are gathering together to begin the arduous task of discussing how to create world peace. The eyes of all humanity are focused on New York, closely watching the development of this international conference. Although most observers still hold a pessimistic view of the future of the United Nations General Assembly, the desire of people in all countries for world peace is so urgent today that as long as there is a glimmer of hope, they ultimately feel that there is a possibility of a breakthrough and will never give up hope. People in all countries still have unlimited expectations for the success of the United Nations General Assembly, so U.S. Undersecretary of State Acheson, on the eve of the United Nations General Assembly, addressed the delegates of various countries and said very frankly: "The United States has consistently supported the United Nations as its foreign policy; and will continue to boldly move forward and continue to adopt this policy without discouragement. The United States government firmly believes that the United Nations will make full progress on the difficult long road and complete world peace." Although these are diplomatic pleasantries from American diplomats, they are enough to increase the confidence of delegates from various countries that the United Nations General Assembly will be successful.</p>
<p>Today, the center of gravity of the world political situation is undoubtedly completely on the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. The key to the success or failure of the United Nations General Assembly also lies here. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, who had just returned from Paris, declared when reporting to the people of the country on the proceedings of the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference: "The most worrying aspect of the current situation is that the tension between the United States and the Soviet Union is increasing rather than decreasing, and the United States has reached the end of its concessions to the Soviet Union." However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, after arriving in New York, issued a statement to the American press saying: "I believe that sincerity and goodwill will certainly lead to mutual understanding; therefore, I also believe that the work facing this United Nations General Assembly will be completed, and any difficulties can be solved easily. The Soviet delegation will be able to contribute to this United Nations General Assembly and the Foreign Ministers' Meeting to be held in early November, so that it can complete its work to promote peace and the well-being of people of all countries, large and small, around the world." Although these are diplomatic pleasantries, they are enough to make the world increasingly hopeful that the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union will improve. Therefore, on the eve of the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, we saw New York filled with an atmosphere of peace and brightness, which is really gratifying, and we hope that the world situation will be brighter from now on and that the world's yearning for peace will not be in vain.</p>
<p>Since we are in this kind of international atmosphere, we should naturally welcome the opening of the United Nations General Assembly with a happy mood and sincerely wish the United Nations General Assembly success. However, looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, after making a comprehensive analysis of the current international situation, we ultimately feel that the future of the United Nations General Assembly is not to be taken too optimistically and that great wise and benevolent politicians from various countries still need to work hard to overcome all difficulties and pave a broad road for world peace. Based on what we have seen, we would like to offer a word to politicians and diplomats from various countries.</p>
<p>First, when we recall the international situation over the past year and a half, we have only seen one disturbance after another, and several basic issues have gone in a big circle and returned to their original starting points without any resolution. This is really the most discouraging phenomenon after the war. In Europe, it has been a year and a half since Nazi Germany unconditionally surrendered and the war ended. In the Far East, it has been more than a year since Japan surrendered. During this period, many politicians and diplomats have tried their best to work for peace, but true peace has not yet come to the world. Internationally, there have been meetings of the five foreign ministers, meetings of the three foreign ministers, the United Nations General Assembly, the meetings of the four foreign ministers, and then from the meetings of the four foreign ministers to the Paris Peace Conference, and now it will be from the United Nations General Assembly to the meetings of the four foreign ministers. The number of international conferences has created an unprecedented record in human history, but what are the results of these international conferences? Let's make a total settlement. The only achievement is the five peace proposals passed by the Paris Peace Conference. Other important issues could not be resolved by the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, so they were transferred to the Paris Peace Conference for handling, but the Paris Peace Conference still failed to reach a resolution, and now they have been returned to the Foreign Ministers' Meeting for discussion. This cruel fact gives us a valuable lesson, that is, creating peace is not easy and requires the cooperation of all countries to have hope of success.</p>
<p>Second, when we study the reasons for the slow progress of peace work, we cannot but attribute it to the fact that the great powers cannot treat each other with sincerity, which leads to mutual suspicion and the emergence of two opposing worlds. In fact, the Soviet Union needs peace and does not want to see war again; the United States also needs peace and hates war; since the goals of both sides are the same, why can't they cooperate in international conferences? This is obviously due to mutual suspicion between the two sides. There is a saying in Chinese: "Without sincerity, there is nothing." Since the United States and the Soviet Union cannot treat each other with sincerity, no problem can be solved. On the contrary, if both sides can be open and honest, nothing is unspeakable, and any difficulty can be easily solved; as the saying goes, "Where sincerity reaches, metal and stone are opened." Foreign Minister Molotov also said this in his speech in New York, which makes us believe that delegates from all countries, especially the United States and the Soviet Union, will be able to treat each other with sincerity in this United Nations General Assembly, abandon all differences in opinions, and reach a completely unanimous agreement.</p>
<p>Third, because we hope that the United Nations General Assembly can be successful, we must point out the defects in the United Nations organization, that is, it lacks democratic spirit in its organization. The post-war world has already entered a new era of peace and democracy, and the present can be regarded as a democratic century. People in all countries of the world not only demand the democratization of domestic politics, but also demand the democratization of international politics. The politics of power has become a historical relic and should not be allowed to revive and reappear on the international stage of the democratic century. After carefully studying the United Nations Charter, we can know that the organization of the United Nations General Assembly that opens today has very undemocratic aspects. In its theory, all countries of the United Nations, regardless of size or strength, are equal in law and completely equal. However, in the Security Council, there is a distinction between permanent members and non-permanent members, and permanent members have the privilege of exercising the veto power over the resolutions passed by the Security Council. Any resolution that is approved by all countries cannot be established as long as one major power (permanent member) expresses dissent. What an undemocratic system this is! Therefore, if we want to hope that the United Nations General Assembly can be successful and that it can become the only effective tool for maintaining world peace, then the veto power must be abolished. There has long been such a movement in the United States, and it has been advocated to all countries in the world, and all countries have expressed their approval. The only country that has expressed opposition is the Soviet Union alone. Before the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union has improved, the Soviet Union alone holds a dissenting opinion. From the standpoint of the Soviet Union, it naturally has its reasons, but when all countries treat each other with sincerity and no longer have fears, the Soviet Union naturally has no reason to insist that the United Nations organization still retain its fatal wound.</p>
<p>In short, the issues discussed at this United Nations General Assembly, in addition to current international disputes, will also discuss various issues that are beneficial to human welfare. It has a very close relationship to the future of all mankind. Therefore, for the benefit of all countries, and also for the future of the world, this conference is only allowed to succeed and not allowed to fail. Let us wish the United Nations General Assembly success here.</p>

<h3>Bizarre Bloodshed in Wuchang District Court Holding Room: Yuan Hongsheng's Throat Suddenly Slit Open</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hankou office on the 22nd] A bizarre bloodshed case occurred in the holding room of the Wuchang District Court yesterday afternoon. The victim, Yuan Hongsheng, had his throat slit open and was bleeding profusely. He immediately fainted and has been sent to the Provincial Hospital for emergency treatment by court officials. His condition is still critical. According to a subsequent investigation, the victim, Yuan, was being tried in court on suspicion of treason. Later, due to insufficient evidence, he was released on bail. Yesterday afternoon, Yuan invited local Baojia gentry to prove his behavior during the occupation. The court first questioned the Baojia gentry, while Yuan waited alone in the holding room. There was originally no one else in the room, but when the bailiff returned to summon him, he found Yuan in a terrible state. Everyone who heard about it was shocked. A search was conducted in the room, but no murder weapon was left behind. It was obviously a case of assassination, and the court is strictly pursuing the murderer.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Repairs Confucian Temple; Plans to Establish Literature Museum</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou office] The Kunshan County Confucian Temple Restoration Committee believes that the county's Confucian Temple was severely damaged by the enemy during the War of Resistance, with the halls and buildings almost completely destroyed. After the victory, local people proposed the idea of ​​repairing it, but because the passing troops were living inside, it was impossible to start construction. Recently, the county temporary council sent a letter to the county government, requesting that the competent authorities order the troops to move out. Repairs should be carried out as soon as possible to protect the relics of the former sages. Therefore, on the 19th, representatives from relevant agencies and local elders were invited to the Minglun Hall of the Fuxue to hold the first meeting to discuss the repair plan.

<p>[Report from our Suzhou on the 22nd] The case in which the High Court sentenced a traitor to death on the 22nd involved Shi Guanggen, who served as a puppet township chief in Bupu Township, Chetai County during the war. During his tenure, he committed all kinds of crimes, including kidnapping and extortion, and had many blood debts. From April to July of the 32nd year of the Republic, he repeatedly arrested Wang Xiaoqin, the principal of the township's primary school, twice, extorting a total of 53,000 yuan. Fearing retaliation, he killed Wang on the evening of July 3 of the same year. After the victory, Wang's family and other victims reported him. After the Suzhou High Court concluded its trial, it ruled that although Shi was only a puppet township chief, his crimes were heinous. In addition to sentencing him to death to uphold the law, all of his property was confiscated.</p>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou on the 22nd] Lu Qi, a judge of the First Pacification Zone Military Court, arrived in Suzhou from Yu on the morning of the 22nd and went directly to the Suzhou High Court to meet with President Sun to discuss matters.

All personnel were excused during the interrogation, and the case seemed to be quite important. The interrogation lasted for more than an hour. Reporters later learned that Lu's trip was to collect evidence for the massacre case by enemy military police officer Haruki Yonemura.</p>
<h3>Enemy-Controlled Wang Yiqing Arrested in Xincang</h3>

As the reporter happened to be interviewing at the headquarters, he learned the details, which are recorded as follows: At around 10:00 AM on the 14th of this month, an incident occurred in Dongjing Bridge in which bandits used weapons to rob the shipping vessel between Suzhou and Ganlu. The 6th Platoon of the Parachute Regiment stationed in Ganlu learned of the incident and set out to search the next day, and contacted and coordinated with the 15th Platoon stationed in Xicang to surround and suppress the bandits. As expected, bandit traces were found in Xinnan Township, and they rushed to arrest them. Bandit leader Li Zaiyang led his troops Mei Baoquan, Gao Jinbao, Qian Xiaodi, Gao Xiaodi, and others and took the lead in firing their weapons and resisting arrest, leading to a fierce battle. Bullets flew like strings of beads, and the two sides made contact for a long time. The bandits retreated when their ammunition ran out. They were pursued to Taofandian Township, where bandit leader Li Zaiyang was shot several times and fell to the ground. He struggled to throw himself into the river in an attempt to escape, but drowned. Bandit Mei committed suicide with a gun, while the two bandits Qian and Gao were captured alive, and four short guns were seized. At the same time, it was discovered that Yao Guilian, the Bao chief of Xinnan Township, was suspected of harboring bandits, and that Bao Yunsheng, a villager, had committed the crime of providing information to bandits. Both were arrested and sent to the Suzhou Headquarters for interrogation according to law. The reporter also learned that bandit leader Li Zaiyang was only in his twenties. He had once sided with the enemy during the puppet era and served as a secret agent. After the victory, he hid in Shanghai.

After the robbery, the bandits fled west. The police received the report and, since there had been robberies in the area from time to time, had taken precautions.</p>
<p>Gambling on Flower Associations Resurges in Various Counties of Taizhou</p>
<p>[Report from our Taizhou office] Gambling on flower associations has been prevalent in the counties of Taizhou. Previously, the District Commissioner's Office strictly prohibited it and ordered the county governments and townships to ban it, and the trend gradually subsided. Unexpectedly, recently gamblers in various counties have once again set up flower associations, set up listening tubes everywhere, and lured foolish men and women to bet in order to make a profit. They have been discovered in the villages of Huangyan, Wenling, Linhai, and Xianju. It is hoped that the authorities will strictly prohibit it.</p>
<h3>Re-investigation Committee Again Visits Suzhou: Thoroughly Investigating Corruption in the Reception of Motor Vehicle Barracks</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 22nd] Wu Cangzhou, a member of the National Participation Council and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District Reception Investigation Group's Jing-Su Team, has recently arrived in Suzhou again from the capital. He is staying at the Lexiang Hotel. Our Suzhou-based special correspondent visited him on the afternoon of the 22nd to inquire about the mission of this trip. He informed us that after returning to the capital from Suzhou, he received a secret report alleging that the Second Battalion of the Twenty-Fourth Motor Vehicle Regiment stationed in Suzhou had concealed the reporting of enemy and puppet vehicles handed over during the reception process. It was alleged that they had secretly sold a portion, lent out a portion, and used another portion for business purposes. Furthermore, they were accused of reporting less gasoline received than they actually obtained, constituting flagrant and confirmed acts of corruption and dereliction of duty. Therefore, Team Leader Fan instructed him to come to Suzhou for a thorough investigation. He has already summoned the battalion commander, Jiang Xiaoyi, for questioning, but the commander has thus far avoided meeting him. He will conduct the investigation independently. Once evidence is collected, he will return to the capital to report and handle the matter according to the law. When the reporter inquired about the details of this corruption and the exact amounts involved, Mr. Wu stated that because the investigation was still ongoing, it was difficult to disclose information at this time.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch] Zhao Xuefeng, a member of the National Participation Council and the Third Team of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District Reception of Enemy and Puppet Assets Investigation Group, stated that the investigation work is now nearing completion. However, many of the secretly reported cases involve too many parties, causing delays. Although the initial stages of each case are becoming clear, they have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In particular, in Bengbu, Anqing, Wuhu, Hefei, and other places in Anhui, there are still many major cases that have not been fully uncovered. It is necessary to enhance work efficiency to complete the mission as soon as possible. Therefore, it is planned to proceed separately, with Ma Jingchang responsible for the central Anhui region, Mr. Zhao responsible for the southern Anhui region, and Yang Wenbing responsible for the northern Jiangsu region. Mr. Ma has already departed for central Anhui, and Mr. Zhao is also about to depart for Wuhu.</p>
<h3>Yixing Suffers from Rainwater Disaster: County Government Sends Personnel to Investigate</h3>
<p>[Our Yixing Dispatch] Since the beginning of autumn, this county has suffered from excessive rainfall, causing flooding in low-lying areas of various districts. The rice fields have been submerged, significantly impacting the harvest. The heads of various townships have reported the disasters. To understand the actual situation, the county government has dispatched several land administration technicians to various districts and townships to investigate the extent of the damage.</p>
<h3>Building a New Jiangxi: Designated Demonstration Counties</h3>
<p>[Our Wuyuan Dispatch] Since the Head of State visited Nanchang last month and gave instructions to "Build a New Jiangxi," in addition to Nanchang being designated as a model city with a foreign urban construction expert specially assigned by the central government to assist in city construction, it has been heard that the provincial government is actively taking steps to implement the Head of State's instructions. They are first establishing demonstration counties and townships. Qingjiang, Pingxiang, and Nankang counties have been designated as first-class demonstration counties, while Yichun, Ganxian, Yuqian, Nanfeng, Xingguo, and this county have been designated as second-class demonstration counties. Local residents are quite excited after receiving this news.</p>
<h3>Thirteen Education and Welfare Stations: Blessing Poor Children in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Hangzhou Dispatch] The Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), in cooperation with various charitable organizations, the Red Cross Society, and religious groups in Hangzhou, has established thirteen children's education and welfare stations. These stations accommodate a total of 1,800 poor and orphaned children. In addition to providing free meals daily, they also teach basic knowledge, including hygiene, music, handicrafts, and games. According to Director Xu of the Huilan Education and Welfare Station, because these children are usually malnourished, most suffer from ringworm, and many also have trachoma. The clinic established by CRRRA within the YMCA is providing free daily treatment. The Huilan Children's Education and Welfare Station is one of the thirteen stations. The station's premises are borrowed from Huilan Middle School, and CRRRA is responsible for providing the necessary food, such as rice, vegetables, milk powder, and canned goods. Books, furniture, and fuel are purchased with donations from the China Red Cross Children's Welfare Committee.</p>

<p>Hope for Extension of Route 7 Buses</p>
<p>The Route 7 public bus service began operating on Double Tenth Day (October 10th). It has indeed provided a great deal of convenience for residents of Hongkou. However, because there is no connection to trams or buses at the starting point at the intersection of Wusong Road and Broadway Mansion, we still feel that it is somewhat inadequate. Most of us Hongkou residents hope that the Route 7 bus service can be extended westward from Broadway Mansion along Suzhou Creek to the Sichuan Road Bridge. This would allow passengers to transfer to Route 17 trolleybuses and Route 2 public buses to reach the central district. The transportation authorities would not incur significant losses, and perhaps ridership and revenue would increase due to the connection to other services. The convenience for us would be substantial. We hope the authorities will reconsider and grant this request. (Cheng Quanlu)</p>
<p>Water Fruit Vendors Also Need to Make a Living</p>
<p>I am a civil servant. The other day, I was passing through the intersection of Fourth Ma Road and Jiangxi Road when I saw a vendor selling apples and pears. Suddenly, a vehicle for catching vendors arrived and took away about seventy percent of the vendor's fruit. The vendor wept and wailed, lying on the sidewalk, wanting to die! Many people felt sorry for him! I think that those who run small businesses are also seeking profit to support themselves. Currently, factories are shutting down everywhere, and there are many unemployed people. Even if they reopen, introductions are required. If even small vendors seeking profit cannot do business, what are they supposed to do? They also have wives, children, and elderly parents at home. Are they supposed to watch them starve to death? Therefore, I hope that the enlightened authorities can allow those who run clean small businesses to endure these difficult times, so they do not lose their livelihoods! (Chen Wenliang)</p>
<h3>Reply via Post</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Fugong Ping: (1) If a private middle school was approved for establishment by the puppet education administrative authorities, its graduates should be regarded as graduates of schools established by the enemy and puppets and subject to screening. (2) If the school was not approved for establishment by the puppet education administrative authorities, it cannot be regarded as a school established by the enemy and puppets. However, if the school has not been submitted to the education administrative authorities for approval, its graduates should still be subject to screening. (3) If the school is located in Wu County, its graduates should submit their applications directly to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education for screening. (4) Graduates of the school who were admitted to national universities before 1946 should also be subject to screening.</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Lu Liangcai: Regarding your previous letter appealing for improvements in the electricity supply, we have received a reply from the Pudong Electric Power Company stating: "Since the recent War of Resistance, our company's power generation equipment has been completely dismantled. Currently, the electricity supply is purchased and resold from the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which has severely restricted the supply due to insufficient capacity. As a result, the power shortage is becoming increasingly serious. Between 5:30 PM and 9:30 PM every evening, the demand for both lighting and power increases significantly. Although our company has published notices to all electricity customers to suspend usage during this time in order to reduce consumption, customers have not strictly complied, leading to a surge in load and frequent malfunctions. The brightness of the lights is uneven, and our company's prevention efforts are inadequate. We deeply regret this. We have now assigned employees to conduct inspections every evening. This situation may be alleviated in the future." We are providing this reply to you.</p>

<p>(5) Punish corruption severely, vigorously implement performance evaluations, and establish a culture of clean and capable governance.</p>
<p>(6) In the pacification zones, farmers who own and cultivate their own land have the right to reclaim their land by presenting their ownership certificates. Farmers who do not cultivate their own land can retain their ownership by presenting their ownership certificates until the government handles the matter according to law. However, their land should continue to be cultivated by the current tenant farmers.</p>
<p>(7) In the pacification zones, the rent paid by tenant farmers to landlords shall not exceed one-third of the normal yield of agricultural products.

<p>(8) In the pacification zones, if farmland has been illegally distributed, if the landlord is missing, or if it is impossible to restore the original situation, the county government should confiscate the land. The land price should be assessed according to law, converted into agricultural products, and land bonds issued by the Farmers Bank of China should be given to the legal owners, to be repaid in installments over the years. The aforementioned land bonds shall be based on agricultural products, and the repayment period shall not exceed fifteen years.</p>
<p>(9) The farmland confiscated by the government shall be given priority for cultivation in the following order, with the farmers cultivating it themselves, paying the price in installments, and obtaining ownership: A. The original tenant farmers before the disturbances; B. The current cultivators; C. Retired soldiers with the ability to cultivate the land and the families of soldiers who fought in the War of Resistance. The government should assist farmers who cultivate the land themselves and guide them in organizing cooperative farms.</p>
<p>(10) In the pacification zones, national taxes and land taxes in areas severely affected by disasters may be exempted for one year with approval. All outstanding taxes and levies from previous years before the recovery shall be waived. Illegal and excessive taxes and levies collected before the recovery shall be abolished.</p>

<p>(12) Cooperative enterprises should be universally promoted in the pacification zones, and rural economies should be developed. The Cooperative Bank and the Farmers Bank of China should provide funding and provide agricultural loans. National and local financial institutions should establish branches to assist in the recovery of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>(13) The food for civilians and the military in the pacification zones should be统籌（unified planning) and supplied by the land and grain authorities. The authorities should register existing grain stores. After fully reserving what each household needs based on its population, the remaining grain can be purchased at the current local price. Illegally requisitioned grain should be confiscated and made public property.</p>
<p>(14) Grain shops, commercial establishments, and factories in the pacification zones should be registered and managed. Those who hoard goods for speculation and manipulate grain prices should be punished according to law. Military and government personnel who manage or requisition grain and engage in extortion or embezzlement should be severely punished.</p>
<p>(15) Special attention should be paid to the restoration and development of cultural and educational undertakings in the pacification zones.

<h3>UN Opium Committee: Restrictions on the Sale and Transport of Narcotics</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] Mr. Mei, a representative of the United Nations Opium Committee, stated today that the worldwide anti-narcotics effort is currently being carried out by three organizations: (1) the Narcotics Advisory Committee, (2) the Central Opium Board, and (3) the Opium Committee. The latter two organizations will have to be merged in the future. Currently, the work is to determine the amount of opium that each country should receive based on statistics and medical needs. If the quantity exceeds the need, the Central Board has the right to request the exporting country to stop transporting to a specific country. Before the war, Japan evaded international control because the Japanese, encouraged by the government, secretly manufactured heroin and used this drug to transport it to China to erode the morale of the Chinese people. Germany also has a kind of artificial drug, similar to morphine, which is not made from poppy seeds and is difficult to control. The future of international drug prohibition is promising.</p>
<h3>Spanish and Iranian Issues: Security Council Retains on Agenda</h3>

<h3>Italian Foreign Minister Nani: Hopes for Increased Friendship Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 21st] On the day he took office, the new Italian Foreign Minister Nani sent a telegram to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, emphasizing the friendly relations between the two countries and expressing his belief that the two foreign ministers, working for the people of both countries and for world peace, will surely achieve success.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Flatly Rejects</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] The US State Department announced today that the Soviet chief representative on the Allied Control Commission for Bulgaria has rejected a US request to convene a special commission meeting to oversee whether the upcoming Bulgarian elections are conducted fairly. General Biryuzov, the Soviet acting chairman of the Control Commission, said that the October 27 elections are a matter for the Bulgarian government, and any action by the Control Commission would be tantamount to interfering in Bulgaria's internal affairs.</p>
<p>Romania Prepares for General Election</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bucharest, 21st] Romanian political parties have begun preparations for the general election scheduled for December 19. This is the first general election since 1937, and women will have the right to vote for the first time.</p>
<h3>British Naval Commander-in-Chief Speech: Emphasizing the Defense of Maritime Communications; Reforming Weapons to Adapt to Modern Warfare</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] British Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Cunningham stated today at the Trafalgar Day Commemoration that future wars will show that the weapons used by warships must undergo active reform. The industrial revolution has made Britain a large manufacturer of goods in peacetime and a large arsenal in wartime. However, continuous industrial production still depends on the continuous import of raw materials. If the source of raw materials and food is cut off in a relatively short period of time, the people of the British Isles will inevitably starve, and industry will inevitably come to a standstill. Therefore, maintaining our maritime communications lines is necessary. If the communications lines are destroyed, the enemy can defeat Britain without using atomic bombs or other new weapons.</p>
<h3>Foreign Secretary Bevin Attends the House of Commons: Explains British Foreign Policy; Agrees that the Saar Region's Economy Should Be Linked to France; Hopes to Establish Lasting Peace with Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 22nd (Radio, London): The British House of Commons began debating foreign affairs issues today. Foreign Secretary Bevin will attend and deliver a speech, the content of which will include the following four points: (1) British-Soviet relations, (2) the German question, (3) the Dardanelles Strait issue, and (4) British-Egyptian treaty negotiations. In addition, the Palestinian issue will also be involved.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Foreign Secretary Bevin recently debated foreign policy in the House of Commons, stating that in order to avoid new disasters, the world should seek new solutions on a broad basis. He said, "If the United States had also participated in leading the handling of European issues after the First World War, the Second World War could have been avoided." Bevin綱 announced that he had informed the French government that he agreed to re-link the Saar region economically to France. The French franc can be officially circulated in Saar to replace the German mark, and France may establish a customs union with Saar. The customs agency should be managed by the Saar side, but the French side believes that it should be managed solely by France and should not be subject to the Control Commission in Berlin. The exact terms agreed to by the British side and whether they contain reservations are not yet known.</p>
<p>Bevin concluded: "The work of disarming Japan has been completed, and we sincerely hope to establish a lasting peace with Japan." In addition, the British troops stationed in Indonesia will be officially withdrawn by November 30.</p>
<p>Dardanelles Sovereignty Issue</p>
<p>Bevin then mentioned the Soviet Union's request to Turkey to jointly manage the Dardanelles Strait, saying that this request is essentially a violation of Turkey's territorial sovereignty.</p>

<h3>The Crux of Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations: Still the Sudan Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Although Anglo-Egyptian negotiations were held today, neither British Foreign Secretary Bevin nor Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky attended. The Egyptian attendees were Foreign Minister Hardi and Ambassador to Britain Amr, while the British attendees were Hoyer Millar, Head of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office, and Ambassador to Egypt Campbell. Sidky is suffering from a cold and, on doctor's orders, did not leave his residence.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky came here to revise the Anglo-Egyptian treaty. Today, he stated that so far, his talks with Foreign Secretary Bevin have progressed smoothly. However, government officials say that the negotiations are not close to resolving outstanding issues. It is reported that Sidky reiterated two final stances to Bevin: that British troops must withdraw from Egypt within two years, and that Sudan must be restored to Egyptian rule. Bevin insisted that British troops could not withdraw within three years and that the status of Sudan should be determined by the Sudanese people themselves. Therefore, Britain cannot agree to abandon the current Anglo-Egyptian condominium. The Sudan issue has consistently been the biggest obstacle in Anglo-Egyptian negotiations. The Egyptian side expects Sidky to return to Cairo on the 28th, and his next step may be to submit the Egyptian issue to the United Nations for discussion.</p>
<h3>Bombay Situation Remains Tense; Gandhi Says the Muslim League Should Have Strong Control Over Bengal; Nehru, Recovered from Injury, Returned to New Delhi Yesterday</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 22nd] Prime Minister Nehru of the interim government was attacked and injured by Muslims while inspecting the Northwest Frontier Province. Following the riots in Calcutta, the situation in Bombay has become even more tense today, with refugees from eastern Bengal fleeing into Calcutta.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 21st] Gandhi stated here today: The Muslim League has a large number of members in Bengal Province and should have the power to control the province. I am scheduled to go to Bengal next week to inspect and comfort the victims. Gandhi also said: "If British forces could withdraw, the disturbances would end more quickly. If British forces remain, both India and the Muslims hope for British power as aid, and I must admit this point." Gandhi criticized the new Muslim League cabinet member Ali for saying that the Muslim League's participation in the interim government was only to promote the Muslim partition proposal, calling this attitude strange and contradictory. The establishment of the interim government is to deal with general national problems such as hunger, cold, disease, poor transportation, and illiteracy, which are problems that do not distinguish between Hindus and Muslims.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peshawar, India, 21st] Nehru and his party of four were surrounded by Muslims near Malakand Fort while inspecting the Northwest Frontier Province by car today. The car windows were smashed by stones, and Nehru suffered injuries to his left ear and left cheek. "Frontier Gandhi" Jaffa, known for his fame, was injured in the nose. Two British reporters also suffered minor injuries. Nehru's minor injuries were quickly treated, and he will return to New Delhi tomorrow to handle cabinet affairs.</p>

<h3>Maintaining a Tranquil State: Longevity Can Exceed One Hundred Years</h3>
<p>Gandhi Discusses the Secrets of Longevity</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 12th] Mahatma Gandhi, now 77 years old, said today: I used to be confident that I could live to be 125 years old, but this belief has now been shaken. Recently, I received congratulations from friends, which caused me to eat too much food and lose my previous "tranquility." If one can always maintain "tranquility" and be comfortable, it is possible to live to 125 years old without illness. Do not be disturbed by anything. Even I personally cannot say that I am completely unaffected by external stimuli.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Orders Reduction in Number of Japanese Factories for Reparations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] General MacArthur announced today a major revision to the list of Japanese private military factories designated for reparations, namely, removing 29 factories from the list and adding 8 others.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] The Airline Pilots Association, affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, called on its members today to strike on all of World Airlines' 28,270 miles of air routes due to failed demands for wage increases. Members of the association fly four-engine "Constellation" and "Sky Master" aircraft, traveling to and from the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the coastal valleys of the United States. This large-scale strike is a historical first in aviation. According to World Airlines, the union is now demanding that pilots of four-engine aircraft fly 20 hours per week and receive an annual salary of $15,000.</p>
<h3>"Tokyo Rose" Innocent</h3>
<p>Federal Bureau of Investigation Declines to Prosecute</p>
<p>[United Press, Los Angeles, 21st] Iva Toguri D'Aquino, an American-born Japanese woman, born in Los Angeles and educated at the University of California, returned to Japan in 1941 to visit relatives. The Pacific War broke out, and she stayed in Japan. During the war, she broadcast under the alias "Tokyo Rose," engaging in propaganda detrimental to the United Nations in the South Pacific. She was arrested in Japan after the war. After more than a year of interrogation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it has now been announced that she will not be prosecuted because "Tokyo Rose" is an abstract name, including at least twelve voices, and cannot be held responsible by one person.</p>
<h3>Ho Chi Minh Declares Vietnam Needs Our Assistance; Agreement on Tariff and Customs Between Vietnam and China Signed; Decision Will Not Hinder Interests of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Haiphong, 21st] A Central News Agency reporter visited Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Vietnamese government, who had just returned to Vietnam from France, on the morning of the 21st. Amidst the cheers of thousands of people outdoors, Ho Chi Minh spoke to the reporter for ten minutes with a calm attitude. Ho Chi Minh first stated that this trip to France resulted in a temporary agreement with the French government, the purpose of which is to normalize relations between the two countries and promote cooperation. The issue of Cochinchina will be resolved separately. The tariff alliance between Vietnam and the French Federation will definitely not seek to restrict the economic interests of overseas Chinese. There is a Chinese saying, "Everyone eats if there is rice." The Vietnamese government views overseas Chinese businesses in this way. Finally, Ho Chi Minh said: When I was in France, I told a Central News Agency reporter that Vietnam needs China's help. Today, I would like to reiterate my wishes to China to a Central News Agency reporter on Vietnamese territory: Vietnam needs China's help, and I will continue to hold this hope in the future because Vietnam has an inseparable relationship with China.</p>
<h3>Overview of Important Issues at the United Nations General Assembly</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 21st] The 53 items on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly are mostly issues of striving for a peaceful world and of lasting interest. After the United Nations General Assembly held in London last winter, representatives of 51 countries will face various important issues, such as the establishment of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, the Security Council's veto power, and the issues of various member states. United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie broadcast on a special United Nations program yesterday, emphasizing the importance of the General Assembly's actions, saying that the General Assembly is "an integral part of the United Nations organization's decision-making" and urging all parties to pay attention, saying that the General Assembly can consider all issues within the scope of the United Nations Charter in addition to the issues already considered by the Security Council. The timetable for considering the various issues stipulates that the General Assembly will hold plenary sessions for four days, after which the various committees should begin their work, and then hold plenary sessions again to discuss the progress of the various committees. The opening ceremony on Wednesday and the subsequent plenary sessions will be held at Meadows Park near New York; committee meetings will be held at the United Nations temporary headquarters at Lake Success. The General Assembly is expected to close in six and a half weeks (or December 7). During this period, the General Assembly will hold</p>
<p>450 sessions, of which approximately 30 to 35 will be plenary sessions, 90 will be major committee meetings, and the remaining sessions will be meetings of other subcommittees. It is expected that 70% of the General Assembly's work will be completed at Lake Success. Plenary and committee meetings are scheduled to be held on weekday mornings and afternoons and on Saturday mornings. There will be no meetings on Sundays. The General Assembly has six main committees, also known as plenary committees, because each committee has</p>
<p>representatives from 51 countries.</p>
<h3>Goods Tax Bureau Levies New Taxes on Seven Items Including Cement and Wheat Flour</h3>
<p>According to Fang Dongtan, Director of the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance: After the destruction by the enemy and puppets, this Bureau was established in Shanghai a year ago. Although all tax systems are said to have reverted to the old rules, the preparations and implementation are no different from creating them from scratch. After repeated reorganizations and improvements, it has gradually progressed and is now expected to be on the right track. In total, since the beginning of the year, the amount of tax revenue has been increasing linearly every month. Starting in October, we have been ordered to add seven new taxes on cement, wheat flour, tea, foil, superstitious paper, beverages, cosmetics, and fur. We will naturally take "enriching the treasury and caring for merchants" as our duty. Although the collection of various new taxes has not yet reached a month, the various experiences can be roughly described. For example, tea is currently being promoted for export, and all exported goods are temporarily exempted from taxation to show encouragement. For fur, whether imported from overseas or transported from domestic production to the mainland, taxes have been paid according to regulations. Although merchants in this city have requested a delay in the collection of taxes on goods produced and sold locally, the Ministry has not approved it, and the Chamber of Commerce is being urged to earnestly persuade them. The taxes should be collected according to the plan. The remaining items such as cement have also been levied according to their production and sales conditions, either by sending personnel to collect taxes at the factories or by strictly examining them during transit and export to prevent loopholes. The overall goal is to promote the benefits to the fullest extent and benefit the treasury. As for rectifying discipline and rewarding whistleblowers, in addition to publishing public announcements in newspapers, we also hope that people from all walks of life will supervise us, he said.</p>

<h3>Electricity is the Soul of Shanghai! The Foundation of Shanghai's Prosperity Lies in Industry, and Industrial Development Depends on Electricity.</h3>
<p>The degree of industrialization in Shanghai can be clearly demonstrated by the electricity consumption figures. The total power generation of the city is 130,000 kilowatts, with household use accounting for only one-third and industrial use accounting for two-thirds. Among the industrial electricity consumption, textile mills consume 42,000 kilowatts, accounting for half of the total. According to Director Zhao Zenggang's estimation, before the war, the work efficiency of textile mills was relatively high, and the amount of electricity required to produce each bale of yarn was 200 to 250 degrees; now, the efficiency of textile mills has not fully recovered, and the production of each bale of yarn requires 300 degrees of electricity. In addition to textile mills, other industries consume one-third of the city's electricity. According to the statistics of the Public Utilities Bureau, the order of electricity consumption for other industries is: (1) weaving industry, (2) flour industry, (3) paper making industry, (4) refrigeration industry, (5) rubber industry, (6) machinery industry, (7) wool weaving industry, (8) tobacco industry, (9) silk mills, (10) oil manufacturing industry. The Public Utilities Bureau has a power supply review organization to review the necessity of each industry for people's livelihood and determine the priority of their power supply. At present, the need for cotton cloth production is the most urgent, so the amount of electricity used by the textile industry will have to be increased in the future.</p>
<p>Power Plants Overburdened</p>
<p>Electricity is the mother of industry. The main reason why Shanghai's industrial productivity cannot be brought to its highest level is the lack of electricity. Shanghai's power plants are now overburdened, which is a sign of illness. Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau explained this situation in detail at a dinner party of the Post-War Factory Rehabilitation Association. He said: The service time of power plants in this city is the highest in the world; in terms of the service coefficient, it is above 80 percent. This means that the machines in the power plants are working for more than 80 hours out of every 100 hours! Another fact is "excessive burden." Because the total power generation is 130,000 kilowatts, while the electricity consumption in Shanghai is as high as 150,000 kilowatts at two times of the day and night. Therefore, it is necessary to restrict electricity consumption in the future.</p>
<p>Four Ways to Increase Production</p>
<p>As for the future electricity control policy, the Public Utilities Bureau has put forward two slogans: "Save waste and increase production." The plans to cancel neon lights, restrict advertising lights, and reduce household electricity consumption by 30% are all based on the principle of saving waste. As for increasing production, the Public Utilities Bureau also has several directions for its efforts. The first is through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). UNRRA has five 2,000-kilowatt generators, and the Bureau hopes that three of them can be used in Shanghai to solve the city's electricity shortage. UNRRA has agreed to leave two, and the Bureau is continuing its efforts. This effort can increase the power by 4,000 to 6,000 kilowatts per month. Secondly, the power generation of the Shanghai Electric Power Company will also increase significantly by next spring. During the enemy and puppet period, the Japanese tried to改造 the machines, but the result was that the parts were damaged, and the power generation was reduced instead. After the takeover, the company hired engineers from the United States to thoroughly repair and improve them. It was originally scheduled to be completed in October, but because the repair was thorough, it will not be possible to generate electricity until January next year. An important machine was sent to the United States for repair, and it happened to coincide with the major strike in the United States. It was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, but it will have to be postponed until February next year before it can be shipped back for power generation. These were all unexpected by the authorities, but it is hoped that they will not be in vain, because starting in February next year, the city will have 37,000 kilowatts of electricity more. The third way is in the Pudong area, where there is a British silk factory with a 2,000-kilowatt power generation facility before the war. During the war, it was dismantled by the Japanese and transported to a certain place, and it is now being moved back. The factory itself only uses 800 kilowatts of electricity, so after the generator is transported back, there will still be surplus electricity to supply the industry in the Pudong area. Fourth, in the Zhabei area, the current power generation is 4,800 kilowatts, which can be increased to 7,000 kilowatts after the machine is repaired. Because of these four sources of supply, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau confidently told the post-war factory rehabilitation companies that the city's electricity shortage will be greatly improved by next spring.</p>
<p>Warships Help Generate Electricity</p>
<p>One thing can illustrate the Public Utilities Bureau's painstaking efforts to solve the electricity shortage problem. They are making the greatest efforts and preparing for the worst situation. If the city's electricity shortage becomes unbearable, the Public Utilities Bureau hopes to borrow electricity from the American warships in the Huangpu River. Their flagship can probably generate more than 4,000 kilowatts, and after its own use, there will be a surplus of 2,000 kilowatts. Of course, this issue is not simple. An American warship supplying electricity to a Chinese city is not something that the commander here can decide. The decision-making power is in the US Navy Department. In terms of power generation, a large warship is capable of meeting the needs of a city. A naval officer who studied in the United States told me that the power generation of the USS Roosevelt aircraft carrier and the USS Missouri battleship are several times greater than Shanghai's electricity consumption.</p>
<p>Electricity Prices Under Consideration for Increase</p>
<p>From the words of the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, it is confirmed that the rumors of an increase in electricity prices are true. He said: The past electricity price regulations were 50 yuan per degree for small households, 73 yuan per degree for large households, and 84 yuan per degree for industrial use. In fact, this is a losing business. The cost of coal was originally 30,000 yuan per ton, but now it is 80,000 yuan per ton. For textile mills, the Public Utilities Bureau has specifically set up a "coal-for-electricity" method, which is equivalent to 200 yuan per degree of electricity; the profit from this is used to subsidize the losses of supplying other industries. This is not a sustainable solution. In terms of the raw materials of power plants, coal and diesel are used together. Since the adjustment of the exchange rate, the price of oil has soared, and the cost of electricity has also increased accordingly. The oil used by the Shanghai Electric Power Company is directly shipped from the United States, and the cost is very high. The reason why they have not immediately raised prices is still the result of negotiations by the Public Utilities Bureau. In summary, an increase in electricity prices is necessary; but how much to increase it is reasonable is still under study. Objectively speaking, from the perspective of people's welfare, the lower the electricity price, the better; but in today's Shanghai, electricity is too cheap, and there is also a lot of waste in households.</p>
<p>Some industrialists are deeply concerned about the cost of coal. They believe that the reason why electricity prices in Hong Kong are so low today is because the local power plants use Annam Hongji coal. They advocate relaxing the scale of coal control and allowing Vietnamese coal to come to China, which will definitely reduce costs. Another argument is to tap into the city's potential electricity. For example, the large textile mills and flour mills now have their own power generation equipment, but because it is cheaper to use public electricity, their own generators are idle. From the perspective of the city as a whole, this is a considerable loss, especially in today's Shanghai, where one more degree of electricity equals one more point of production.</p>
<p>Optimistic About Shanghai's Future</p>
<p>Shanghai is a large industrial and commercial metropolis, and the foundation of Shanghai's prosperity is built on industry. Director Zhao gave an optimistic outlook on Shanghai's future. He said that in 25 years, Shanghai will be a world-class metropolis with 7 million people, not just China's "window." In addition to the existing industrial zone, there should be four new industrial zones——Zhabei, Nanshi, the city center, and Pudong. A modern port will be built in the area around Rihui Port and Wusongkou.

<h3>Thorough Investigation of Forcibly Occupied Houses, Inspector Tang Left Shanghai Yesterday to Return to Beijing for Work, Expected to Conclude by Month's End</h3>
<p>General Tang Enbo, acting Commander-in-Chief of the Army and concurrently Garrison Commander of Beijing and Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai on the 20th upon instruction from the Chairman to thoroughly investigate the forcible occupation of houses by personnel of the Party, government, and military, and to provide guidance for the city's winter defense conference. It is now learned that Tang's mission has been completed and he has left Shanghai by train to return to Beijing. Tang expressed satisfaction with the results of the investigation and highly commended the hard work of the personnel involved. Before his departure, Tang stated: As of now, the Garrison Headquarters has received a total of 1,327 requests for the removal of military personnel occupying houses. However, according to the investigation, actual cases of military personnel formally occupying houses account for only a quarter of the total, and all have been vacated after enforcement. The nature and handling methods of these 1,327 cases are as follows: (1) 143 cases involved enemy property occupied by military personnel and civilians. Because these houses were enemy property, they have been referred to the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau. (2) 145 cases involved civilian houses occupied by government agencies, Party organs, and military units. The relevant agencies and units have been instructed to handle the matter through legal procedures and report to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of National Defense for record. (3) 205 cases involved occupation by Party and government personnel and civilians. As these individuals did not have military status, the cases have been referred to the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government. (4) 415 cases involved occupation by military personnel, and orders to vacate have been enforced. (5) 419 cases involved rental disputes, and the parties concerned have been instructed to apply to the court or the Housing Rental Management Committee for mediation. The above enforcement work has been ordered to be completed by the 25th of this month. As for the cases of occupied houses still under investigation by the Garrison Headquarters, there are still over 150 cases, of which over 130 cases can be enforced immediately. The entire task is expected to be completed by the end of the month. In addition, Tang gave detailed instructions on the city's public order and winter defense. It is said that he may return to Shanghai again within days after returning to Beijing this time.</p>
<h3>Soviet Bishop Suspected of Espionage, Military Tribunal Conducts First Interrogation, Soviet Consul's Request for Bail Denied, Rumors of Mistreatment Absolutely Untrue</h3>
<p>Viktor, a Soviet-籍Greek Orthodox bishop, was arrested by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on the 19th on suspicion of espionage. Soviet Consul in Shanghai, Harin, once went to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request bail, but it was denied due to the seriousness of the matter.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 21st, he was transferred from the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters to the Military Tribunal of the First Pacification Zone. At 2 PM on the 22nd, Prosecutor Lin Wopeng of the High Procuratorate at Tilanqiao Prison conducted the interrogation. Viktor wore a light blue cloth robe with a black clerical coat over it. Ten minutes before the interrogation, Soviet Ambassador to Shanghai Harin waited at the High Procuratorate, but was unable to speak to Viktor as he was escorted out of the prison. The interrogation lasted for one and a half hours, and the content was not disclosed. It is reported that the interrogation only inquired about Viktor's background and whereabouts during the war. The interrogation will continue today, and he is still being held in Tilanqiao Prison.</p>
<p>It is reported that the reason for Viktor's arrest this time is that he was used by the Japanese invaders during the war to organize a cavalry隊to sabotage China's sacred war of resistance and engage in espionage activities for the enemy. He once received a Grand Order of Merit from the Japanese Emperor, and there are photos to prove his acceptance of a puppet post. These documents were handed over to the military tribunal by the Garrison Headquarters yesterday morning. If the investigation confirms the evidence, he will be prosecuted for war crimes; otherwise, he should be released. As for the rumors that Viktor is being mistreated in prison, they are absolutely untrue.</p>
<p>The Soviet community in this city is now actively launching a signature campaign to rescue him. It is reported that hundreds of people have signed, and they will launch petitions and parades to our authorities. As for the Soviet Consulate, it is currently in negotiations with our highest authorities, requesting bail.</p>

<h3>The Old Case of He Yuxiang's Martyrdom Six Years Ago Is Brought Up Again: The Case of the Former White Russian Soldier of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Shooting the Lone Army Is Concluded, Squad Leader Testifies to Witnessing the Shooting, Lawyer Argues That Murder Cannot Be Proven</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The court reopened the case of the White Russian soldier shooting the Lone Army yesterday afternoon. The witnesses, Ivanoff (former Major Commander of the White Russian隊of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps) and Shi Hongmo, former squad leader of the Fourth 行Lone Army, were summoned. Judge Wu Ronglin, Prosecutor Fang Zheng, and Clerk Xie Yinsheng took their seats. First, the defendant, Mitchiakov, was questioned about how many posts there were next to the Lone Army camp in September of the 29th year of the Republic. Mitchiakov replied: There were only seven posts in peacetime, but because the situation was tense at the time, it was increased to thirteen posts. On the day of the incident, Rakhitaev, the guard at the seventh post, also fired a shot. He did not know who fired the shot that killed He Yuxiang.</p>
<p>White Russian Commander Presents Diary</p>
<p>The presiding judge then questioned the witness Ivanoff. According to his testimony, there were a total of 320 White Russian隊guards guarding the Lone Army camp. On September 18 of the 29th year of the Republic, he was not present, and he was not in charge of the White Russian隊at that time. He only learned from the report after the incident that Mitchiakov fired a shot at 12:45 PM, and 30 seconds later, Rakhitaev, the guard at the seventh post, also fired a shot in the same direction. Ivanoff also presented the "Daily Diary" of the White Russian隊at the time to the court for reference.</p>
<p>A Loud Bang, and He Fell to the Ground</p>
<p>The witness Shi Hongmo, squad leader of the Lone Army, gave a very detailed account of the case, stating: Four days before the incident, an unfortunate incident had occurred in which the White Russians used tear gas and water taps to attack the Lone Army. The Lone Army members were all unarmed, and five brothers were killed or injured. He could not remember the names of the individuals due to the passage of time. The day of the incident was "September 18." Early in the morning, people came to the Lone Army camp to express their sympathy, but they were unable to enter because the White Russian隊had blockaded the entrance. By around 11 AM, more and more people had gathered. He (Shi Hongmo referring to himself) was ordered by Commander Xie to go to the gate to investigate. He stood shoulder to shoulder with the victim He Yuxiang on a long bench, peeking outside the wall. The defendant, Mitchiakov, was at the first post and aimed his gun three times in succession. The first two times he did not fire, but the third time he aimed for about a minute. With a loud bang, He Yuxiang fell to the ground. The bullet penetrated He Yuxiang's head and then injured another soldier, Gao Guangyun, in the leg, because Gao was standing on a wooden rack for washing his face behind He Yuxiang, so He Yuxiang's death was actually caused by Mitchiakov's bullet. Although the seventh post also fired a shot, it did not injure anyone. Judge Wu asked Mitchiakov again based on the witness's statement. Mitchiakov denied aiming three times and claimed that it was impossible for one shot to injure two people. After the witness made his statement, the presiding judge announced the start of the debate. The prosecutor stood up first and stated: The fact that Mitchiakov shot and killed He Yuxiang has been proven by witnesses, and Mitchiakov has also admitted to firing the shot, so he should be charged with murder.</p>
<p>Lawyer Explains the Circumstances at the Time</p>
<p>Liu Jiangang, the defense lawyer for the defendant, stood up and first explained the circumstances at the time, stating: At that time, the Japanese army was wreaking havoc in the suburbs of Shanghai and repeatedly negotiated with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Concession to take over the Lone Army. The Municipal Council sent the White Russian隊to guard the Lone Army camp, ostensibly to watch over them, but in reality, to protect them in secret. He asked Frankling, who was in charge of the Shanghai Municipal Council at the time, and was told: On September 14 of that year, because the Lone Army raised the national flag without permission, the British army ordered them to lower the flag within three hours. The Lone Army did not comply, and the White Russian隊was ordered to release tear gas and use water hoses to disperse the Lone Army and lower the national flag, which caused a serious incident and tension. On "September 18," crowds gathered around the Lone Army camp. Mitchiakov's first post was especially crowded. Mitchiakov could not help but be alarmed under the encirclement. Six years ago, Mitchiakov was not yet twenty years old and was actually a minor. He asked Ivanoff, "Since the situation was so tense at the time, why didn't you send more guards to protect them, but instead let a minor take on this important task?" Now, although the defendant admits to firing the shot, it cannot be proven that he committed murder. There are two points to note in this case: (1) The death of He Yuxiang was not thoroughly investigated at the time because Commander Xie of the Lone Army camp did not allow the White Russians to enter the camp. Also, Mitchiakov was not the only one who fired a shot. Six years later, it is even more impossible to prove whose bullet killed He Yuxiang. Since the basis for the crime has not been established, how can he be convicted? (2) The act itself: Mitchiakov was surrounded by the public on the outside, and the Lone Army was responding on the inside, so the situation was extremely serious. According to the Lone Army camp guard instructions, the guard can fire his weapon if he encounters coercion or is in danger of being disarmed. The defendant, a White Russian, did not receive a good education, and his understanding of the law was probably not very clear. This order was issued by the British army, and the White Russian隊's enlistment documents also stated that they would abide by the regulations of the British army. Therefore, should the defendant be held legally responsible for firing the shot? Please, your court, decide and request that the defendant be acquitted or given the lightest possible punishment. At this point, the presiding judge announced the end of the debate and set the verdict for 2 PM on the 28th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>The Inside Story of Shanghai Pickpocket Gangs (3)</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>The Hat Is Stolen, Gone Like a Wild Goose in the Sky</p>
<p>"Catching turtles" means snatching hats, especially expensive Western-style felt hats. Shanghainese commonly refer to it as "throwing the top palace," which has almost become a well-known term, but those involved have stopped using it. Usually, the "hard pickpocket" brothers who are particularly skilled at snatching hats are always in groups of two or three, lingering at tram and bus stops. They first spot the hat worn by a passenger near the window. Once the vehicle starts moving, they snatch it from the window and run away. The loser is not able to get off the vehicle immediately, and the vehicle is often packed like sardines. By the time the loser gets off the vehicle, the thief is long gone. When rickshaws and pedicabs are speeding, the felt hats of the passengers on the vehicle are also good targets. The pickpocket gang only needs to lightly stretch out their arms to grab the hat. Then they run madly in the opposite direction and hand it over to an accomplice. Even if the police pursue them, they often fail to catch them. This kind of "pickpocket gang" also "catches turtles" on the train platforms of the two railway bureaus. In recent years, the security at the railway platforms has been stricter, and the traces of this kind of people have not been often found on the platform.</p>
<p>The activity groups of the "hard pickpocket gang" are all controlled by the "uncle gang." The time and location are determined in advance, and "foreigners" who are not part of the gang cannot intrude and "steal their business."</p>
<p>The time for them to take action is set in the early morning, noon, and dusk. Because in the early morning, citizens are crowded at the train stations, and at noon and evening, pedestrians are crowded on the roads, both of which are conducive to escaping after the theft. Their activity locations are chosen in places with many side streets, or where the alleys are branched, and one of the skilled members of the group carries out the snatching and runs immediately. At this time, the loser will inevitably shout and chase after them. Then the accomplices pretend to be unrelated passersby and stop the loser to falsely inquire, in order to delay the loser's time and prevent pursuers who see the injustice. According to this strategy, they adapt to the situation and let the accomplice who snatched the item escape from danger through the side streets. These accomplices are called "wind blockers."</p>
<p>Sneaky and with Many Tricks</p>
<p>"Literary errand" is the second type of "eating bad rice." Unlike the forceful robbery of the "hard pickpocket" gang, they are sneaky "rats and dogs thieves." Because some of their behavior is relatively civilized, it is called "literary errand." The categories of their activities and performance methods are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Flipping over the head" - This gang always uses thick ropes or wooden ladders to climb over other people's walls or roofs to enter the house and then steal.</p>
<p>(2) "Prying open the fan" - The theft involves prying open the door with a small iron crowbar.</p>
<p>(3) "Running early morning" - Most of the people's houses are opened early in the morning to pour out the toilet or to clean. The petty thieves use this time to sneak in and grab something quickly.</p>
<p>(4) "Running to the lamplight" - Also known as "crow's head." In the evening dusk, most residents leave the back door ajar, and the petty thieves use the opportunity to sneak in and be active.</p>
<p>(5) "Going to heaven's watch" - People dry clothes on the drying racks on the sun terrace or in the courtyard every day, and most of the time, no one is watching. The petty thieves use long bamboo poles to pick down the clothes, regardless of whether they are dry or wet, and sweep them all away.</p>
<p>(6) "Cutting the crack" - If a residence locks the door, it shows that no one is inside. If the petty thief knows in advance that the family is rich, they will take advantage of the lack of preparation to break the lock and enter the house to steal calmly.</p>
<p>(7) "Running to the kiln" - This gang of thieves does not set a specific time, and their activity method is also very free. They steal anything they can get and leave immediately. No matter when, they take advantage of the gap to enter. They must also have the ability to distinguish. They will not take things that are not valuable. For example, if they enter a large family's house, they will pay attention to antiques, calligraphy and paintings, clocks, screens, and tripods in the hall.</p>
<p>(8) "Opening Tao Yuan" - Digging a hole in the wall to steal things, also known as "opening the kiln mouth."</p>
<p>(9) "Going to the bolt" - That is, a window-prying thief.</p>
<p>(10) "Lowering the bolt" - That is, a door-prying thief.</p>
<p>(11) "Breaking into the kiln" - Using the excuse of asking for directions, sneak into people's houses to steal.</p>
<h3>"Hardware King" Trial Concluded, Awaiting Verdict, Zhang Lianfang's "Great Reasoning" Brings Family to Tears</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Zhang Shufang, known as the "Hardware King" of Shanghai, was arrested after the victory on suspicion of being a traitor. The High Procuratorate concluded the investigation and filed a public prosecution, listing three charges: (1) Serving as the Chairman of the Puppet Shanghai Hardware Industry Association, (2) Serving as the Director of the Puppet Hardware, Steel, and Copper Strip Joint Office, (3) Serving as the Bao長of the 6th Bao of the 2nd Lian保of the Puppet Huangpu District, with acts of requisitioning iron on behalf of the enemy. The High Court held several hearings to investigate the case, and the debate court was concluded yesterday afternoon. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 29th of this month.</p>
<p>Zhang testified in court yesterday: He had resigned from the chairmanship of the association more than 20 times, but it was all because of the "recommendation and retention" of his colleagues that he did not succeed. This was purely to seek "welfare" for his colleagues and did not harm the country. As for the Pacific War that started on December 8th, 1941, the Japanese took planned actions and sealed up all the warehouses of the four industries in this city: hardware, copper strips, copper and tin, and steel. They ordered that the inventory must be registered. Under the circumstances at the time, there was no way to resist, so a joint office was organized to cope with it. The office only had a secretary and a tea boy, and there were no titles such as members or directors. It was only a place where colleagues gathered daily to seek to rescue materials and protect industry and commerce, so as to preserve a little vitality for the country. After the establishment of the Hardware Office, it did not use hardware to aid the enemy, nor did it collect hardware on behalf of the enemy. Because the colleagues had already registered the inventory with the enemy, they would take as much as they wanted. As a result, the enemy navy took 1,200 tons, and the enemy army took 700 tons, totaling about 2,000 tons. This matter did not go through the joint office, but was a separate matter for each colleague. As for serving as a puppet 保長, it was because he had some status in Shanghai that he was forced to take on the role. In 1944, the enemy puppets launched a city-wide 保甲獻iron campaign. When the 保長大会was convened, he did not attend. As a result, the Lian保長ordered the 保長to转甲長to转 to each household and have each household send the iron directly to the puppet police局, without going through the 保長office. Under the circumstances at the time, the citizens were also forced to do so. He was purely a businessman and had no intention of aiding the enemy. In the early days of the war, he once fled to Hong Kong because 76 号forced him to participate in a puppet organization. Later, he returned to Shanghai at the insistence of his colleagues to maintain the association. Later, he secretly transported materials to the interior but was known to the enemy, so he was captured in the north and tortured. At that time, he only hoped that the days would be bright again. Now, he has been detained for more than a year on the charge of being a traitor, which is really an extreme injustice. If he was willing to betray the country, please punish him severely; otherwise, please consider the facts and acquit him. At this point, his family members who were in the audience could not help but weep. After the trial, the defendant was still escorted back to prison by the bailiff.</p>
<h3>Shen Fenggang Constantly Quibbling</h3>
<p>Shen Fenggang, a key figure in the puppet government's special agent force, who successively served as the Director of the Third Office of the Puppet Special Agent Headquarters, the Captain of the First Special Agent Brigade, and the Director of the Puppet Jiangsu Province Qing乡Inspection, was accused of killing many underground comrades. The High Court has held several hearings to investigate the case. Yesterday morning, he was questioned again. Shen still did not admit to any of the crimes listed in the indictment. The court set aside the case for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Li Zuyu and Wang Hongding Are Scheduled to Be Sentenced on the 29th</h3>
<p>The case of Li Zuyu (pictured), who successively served as the Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Industry, the Political Counselor of the Puppet National Government, and the Director of the Planning Department of the Puppet Business Coordination Committee, was concluded yesterday morning, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced at 9:30 AM on the 29th of this month. In addition, the case of Wang Hongding, a puppet 保長, is also scheduled to be sentenced on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Li Xibo's Sentence Changed to Two and a Half Years, Feng Guanfu Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Li Xibo, the Deputy Director of the Special High Stock of the Puppet Shanghai Taishan Police Sub局, was previously sentenced to three years in prison by the High Court. After appealing to the Supreme Court, it was remanded for retrial. Yesterday, the sentence was changed to two years and six months of imprisonment. In addition, Feng Guanfu, who worked at the enemy-run Gongda Cotton Mill as a driver and translator, was accused of having the suspicion of communicating with the enemy. After the High Court concluded the trial, it was determined that he had not committed any crime, and the defendant was acquitted yesterday.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Restoring the Curfew Are Not True</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Yesterday, various newspapers reported that the winter security conference of the military organs had decided that the curfew in this city would be restored from the first of next month. However, according to the results of the reporter's visit to the person in charge of the police局, the news is absolutely incorrect. At present, the Garrison Headquarters has not yet considered this matter.</p>

<p>Answers to Readers' Legal Inquiries</p>
<p>(1) Forged Lost Receipt</p>
<p>A reader named Yi-ming asks for clarification on several legal questions: In the 32nd year of the Republic of China [1943], Mr. Jia mortgaged two shares of land to my late father through Mr. Yi as an intermediary. After our hometown was occupied in the 29th year [1940], Mr. Yi took advantage of his power to buy the land from Mr. Jia. I was not notified at the time (Mr. Jia has now passed away). After the victory, I entrusted someone to negotiate with Mr. Yi, who colluded with my stepmother to forge a lost receipt, stating that when Mr. Jia previously mortgaged the land to my late father, the loan receipt was lost and the debt had been repaid. The lost receipt was signed with my late father's seal. I have several questions and would appreciate your answers: (1) The original intermediary and the buyer were both arranged by Mr. Yi, and I was not notified. Can I deny this transaction? (2) Mr. Jia has passed away. Can his property be considered mine and can I apply for land registration? (3) Can I sue for forging my late father's lost receipt? (4) Can publishing a notice to invalidate my late father's seal be used to invalidate the lost receipt at the same time?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Cao Ya-xia] (1) No. Because after the property owner sets a mortgage, they can transfer the property to others, and there is no regulation that the intermediary for the mortgage cannot also be the buyer. (2) No. It is not permitted by law for the ownership of the mortgaged property to be directly transferred to the mortgagee. (3) If it is indeed forged, you can sue for the crime of forging documents. (4) Publishing a notice of invalidation cannot invalidate a receipt that was previously established.</p>
<p>(2) Redemption of Mortgaged Land</p>
<p>Ren Cheng-fu asks: In the third year of the Republic of China [1914], my great-grandfather mortgaged a piece of land with a 'living deed' for sixty silver dollars, and built a house on it. The contract clearly stated a five-year term for redemption. After five years, thirty-five silver dollars were added, and another contract was written, stating that when redeeming, the original sum should be returned together, with no shortage. In the thirteenth year [1924], ten silver dollars were borrowed with a monthly interest rate of three percent. The house was burned down by the enemy during the war. When the enemy surrendered, I wanted to rebuild the house on the land, but the mortgagee intends to redeem it. I can barely afford to build the house, but I worry about future disputes. Legally speaking, can the land be redeemed by the mortgagee? Please answer in your column.</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Cao Ya-xia] According to Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 2558, item 7, "For pawn rights established before the implementation of the Regulations for Clearing Real Estate Pawns, if a term is specified, redemption is allowed within two years after thirty years from the date of the pawn, regardless of whether the term has been extended by contract." The Regulations for Clearing Real Estate Pawns were implemented in the fourth year of the Republic of China [1915]. This pawn was established in the third year of the Republic of China [1914], and can be handled according to the above interpretation. The legal period for redeeming pawned items can be extended by two years after the implementation of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery, as stated in Article 7 of the same regulations, if the legal period for redemption could not be observed due to the war. Therefore, legally speaking, this pawned item can still be redeemed.</p>

<h3>Wool Yarn Price Evaluation: Subcommittee Investigates Cost Standards, Divided into Three Grades, Fine Wool Yarn to be Separately Determined; Future Deliveries Limited to Members of the Same Trade Association</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Wool Yarn Review Committee established by the Social Affairs Bureau held its second meeting yesterday afternoon at 10:00 AM. Representatives from the Wool Yarn Industry Association, the Commercial Association, Chen Qi'en, Shen Lai-zhou, and representatives from Bee Factory and EWO Factory, among others, attended. Representatives from the Municipal Council and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were also present. Director Gu Bingyuan presided over the meeting. First, the Industry Association reported on cost calculations, and the Commercial Association reported on recent market conditions. It was noted that the market price of wool yarn had fallen by 20 to 30 percent in the last ten days. Based on the current market price of raw wool and factory taxes, prices seemed to be stabilizing. Everyone was pleased, but the task of reviewing standard prices required further effort. It was decided to establish a subcommittee to investigate actual costs, with representatives from the Bureau, the Industry Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to serve as a basis for determining standard market prices for wool yarn. It is proposed to divide the evaluation into three grades: the first grade is made of 56 counts or more, such as Bee, Cat, Hero, Popular, and Earth brands; the second grade is made of less than 56 counts, such as Golden Dog and Beauty brands; and the third grade is made of less than 48 counts, such as Scholar and Girl brands. The cost investigation will target these grades, but these three grades are all four-strand coarse wool yarn. The ratio for fine wool yarn will be determined separately and will fluctuate accordingly. Regarding the sale of imported raw wool and yarn by trading companies, it should be limited to the wool yarn industry. Those operating wool yarn in the market should join the Industry Association. The Industry Association representatives strongly advocated for these points, which were approved in principle. It was also decided that future deliveries of wool yarn from factories must be limited to members of the Industry Association to prevent disruption by outsiders.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Transactions Are Quiet: China Merchants' Evaluation and Allotment Amounts are Restored; the Weaving Industry Hopes the Joint Allocation Will Continue</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Li Sheng-bo, Deputy Director of the Textile Business Management Committee, specially convened an informal meeting with key directors of the Sixth District Machinery Textile Industry Association at the Association's address to discuss the reasonable evaluation of cotton yarn distribution in the future and the allotment amounts for national and private yarn factories. The discussion lasted for three hours, but it is reported that it was limited to an exchange of opinions and no concrete decisions were reached.</p>
<p>According to a certain authority in the dyeing and weaving industry in this city: the joint allocation of cotton yarn must continue. Each factory should seek solutions in a sincere and frank manner regarding the joint allocation policy in order to achieve success.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market softened slightly. Sales remained sluggish, and cloth factories also stopped production due to sluggish sales of finished products. At the same time, major yarn factories were secretly selling off their inventory, which caused prices to weaken. However, public sentiment remained stable, and there was no significant price drop. The market was relatively stable yesterday. Merchant groups from Hankou and Nanjing had some transactions, but their appetite was very small. The prices offered by Fangjian have been newly adjusted. Blue Chicken was 77,000 yuan, but Xinyang Crane remained at 77,000 yuan. Very few applications were received from local merchants. Dyeing factories made some purchases due to active sales, but the quantities were not large. If yarn prices can be suppressed, the cloth market may soften.</p>
<h3>Fangjian's New Cotton Purchases Have No Set Prices or Quantities</h3>
<p>In order to enrich textile raw materials and maintain the increase in national cotton production, the Textile Company has now decided to start purchasing new cotton in various places as much as possible. The company has instructed its offices in various places to start purchasing. However, it will not adopt a price limit system, but will set reasonable prices based on the cost in the production area. The quantity of purchases is also not specified. The purchase areas include Shantou, Xi'an, and Nantong. The newly established Zhengzhou office will also be a purchase area. However, all private yarn factories in the areas where the company purchases are free to purchase and are not restricted.</p>
<h3>Cotton Export Exchange Can Be Converted to Loan</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Nanjing on the 22nd] The method of exporting cotton from production areas to cotton-using areas for export exchange this year was previously approved in principle by the Joint Treasury with five prices. It is now reported that the Treasury has now issued three supplementary measures: (1) After September 20th, cotton purchased by factories from production areas can be converted into loans after arriving at the factory site, according to the original principles. The maximum period is 45 days. (2) Cotton already purchased and stored by factories may not be converted into loans. (3) When applying to convert the cotton export exchange into a loan, factories must provide the original export exchange documents or equivalent documents for verification in order to assist in production and sales and prevent hoarding. The above measures have been telegraphed by the Joint Treasury to all branches for compliance, and to all branches to inform local offices.</p>
<h3>Demand for Gold and Diamonds is Highest in China and India</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] In some countries, the demand for diamonds is very high, especially in China and India. Due to the instability of the domestic situation, buying diamonds is still the easiest way to maintain value. Although the price of gemstones is lower, it does not affect the market price of rough diamonds. The demand from all parties far exceeds the possible supply. In terms of the needs of the United States and the world, demand exceeds supply by at least three to one.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Hover, Foreign Firms Are Interested</h3>
<p>Government bonds once broke the 2,000 yuan mark yesterday, but because foreign firms were interested, the situation remained volatile. Tong Bing opened at 2,070 yuan yesterday morning and fell to 1,990 yuan. However, foreign firms bought more than one million yuan, and the price struggled around 2,050 yuan, similar to the previous closing price. Jia Yi and Yi fell by 30 yuan each, and Tong Wu rose slightly by 20 yuan. The transaction volume was about six million yuan.</p>
<h3>Amidst Controls, Yarn Factories Have Three Wishes: Allocation of Cotton, Uninterrupted Power, and No Rigid Price Limits</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu, Chairman of the Textile Control Committee, decided the day before yesterday to allocate 10,529 bales of yarn first, with the price and date to be determined separately. According to yarn factory opinions, it is difficult to achieve fairness and rationality when materials are scarce. Although yarn factories appear prosperous on the surface, they are actually empty shells. For example, the current price limit is 1.55 million yuan per piece, but the cost of three piculs of cotton is about one million yuan, plus electricity, interest, and other expenses, which already exceeds the price limit. There was a time when they were slightly better than other industries, but the current situation is very difficult. For example, even if the electricity supply is not considered, the price of electricity is a problem. The original price of electricity was 84 yuan per unit, but since the exchange of coal for electricity, the price of each ton of coal is 120,000 yuan, which has invisibly increased the price of each unit of electricity to 200 yuan. In terms of productivity, in the past, each shift worked 12 hours a day, two shifts a day. Now each shift works 10 hours a day, 20 hours a day. In the past, there were ten days in a week, but now there are seven days in a week, and sometimes power outages must be rotated. Even if the factory wants to increase production, it is limited by various facts. The solutions that yarn factories currently hope to resolve are: first, implement the allocation of cotton, and the government should try its best to supply cotton raw materials to reduce costs; second, supply electricity. The current rotating power outages and sudden power cuts affect the increase in production; third, implement evaluation instead of rigid price limits.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Fluctuates Greatly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 21st] The New York cotton market opened actively with large fluctuations. At one point, it was declared a limit down due to heavy selling. However, it rebounded due to purchases by traders. In the afternoon, there were alternating ups and downs. The total transaction volume for the day exceeded 600,000 bales. According to the New York Cotton Exchange, as of the end of September, the total amount of various cottons stored in the United States was 13,667,000 bales, of which one million bales held by the government have been designated for various projects.</p>
<h3>Gold and Banknotes are Firm</h3>
<p>Gold ingots gradually strengthened from stable. They opened around 2.21 million in the morning. The market was extremely stable at the opening, hovering around 2.21 million. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 130 bars at a price of 2.21 million. There was little change at this time. Later, sales were slightly higher, and credit conditions loosened. Buyers were slightly more active, and the price rose to over 2.23 million at noon. In the afternoon, next-day delivery initially strengthened and then stabilized. The result was an increase of 15,000 compared to the previous closing. Gold jewelry, silver ingots, and silver dollars remained unchanged. Interest rates on the black market were slightly lower, from 1.5 to 1.7 percent per month.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were calm. The buying price for US dollars on the market was still 3,500 yuan. There was no income, and it was still difficult to open trading. The black market price was about 4,050 yuan to 4,150 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose slightly to 4,100 yuan to 4,200 yuan, the same as the previous closing. Hong Kong dollars were stable and unchanged. The result was flat. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose slightly due to the increase in telegrams from Hong Kong and Shanghai. The sales were sluggish in this city, so the price was lower. It was sold at 885 yuan in the early morning, and then rose slightly to 880 yuan to 900 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 1,060 yuan to 1,080 yuan, the British exchange rate was 14,100 to 14,120 yuan, and the US exchange rate was flat. There was still no trading.</p>
<h3>Powerful Competition Between Long and Short Positions, Chinese Stocks Initially Weakened and Then Strengthened, Five Harmony Stocks Rose and Fell to the Limit</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks initially weakened and then strengthened yesterday. The shorts were the first to waver, causing this. The opening prices of each stock were relatively stable in the early morning. After the opening, they were slightly stable. Soon, sellers were active, and panic among the longs was not eliminated. Yong Yarn fell to 707 yuan, Meiya to 3,740 yuan, Jingfu to 246 yuan, Xinguang to 254 yuan, and Xinhe to 312 yuan. After the market calmed down slightly, merchants from Guangdong, such as No. 232, started buying, and the situation changed. Gradually, they rose back. Table merchants first covered their shorts. After 10:20 AM, the situation turned around. Outside the market, banks strongly bought Yong Yarn, and a short squeeze was formed. After that, everything went smoothly, and the price rose. At high prices, there was still a lot of struggle. Near noon, the long and short positions were fighting fiercely, and the price was fluctuating. At noon, the hot stocks, such as Yong Yarn and Xinhe, rose by about 50%, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing only rose slightly. Except for the small decline in Xin Ya, the cold stocks also rose slightly. The situation was slightly stronger after the market opened in the afternoon, and continued to rise slightly. After arbitrageurs and sellers returned their goods, the shorts took the opportunity to suppress the price. After 2:30 PM, it fell back again. Near the close, the price fell and then stabilized. Wuhe Weaving initially fell from a selling price of 700 yuan to the limit down. After one unit was traded, buyers came after hearing the news and raised the price again. Within minutes of the close, No. 204 raised the price to buy. When the bell rang, it rose to the limit up, creating a new record for the speed of change in the market, but the transaction was not widespread. As a result, hot stocks such as Yong Yarn, Xinhe, and Jingfu rose slightly compared to the previous close, Meiya was flat, and Xinguang and Qinxing fell slightly. Among the cold stocks, Wuhe was up 15% alone, Datong Rongfeng Underwear was up 5%, Xin Ya and Zhongsi were flat, Company Cement fell slightly, and Zhongfang Tongyi, Match, Jinglun, and Huafeng rose slightly. Outside the market, except for Zhongfa, which rose 5%, the rises and falls of the remaining stocks were slight.</p>
<p>The news that foreign stocks will be auctioned in Hong Kong has risen again. Western merchants have accepted it, and Jardine Matheson is even more profitable. Except for Yeguang, the rest have risen. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Jardine Matheson rose 10% alone, IPA rose more than 5%, Yeguang was flat, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<h3>After the New Commodity Tax is Levied, Most Factories are Shutting Down, Tax Revenue is Only 100 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a person in charge of the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance: After the Ministry of Finance stipulated that seven new commodity taxes should be levied from the 1st of this month, the Bureau immediately complied with the order. However, the actual levy has only been for nearly a week. The tax items levied in this city are only wheat flour, fur, cement, beverages, and cosmetics. The other two items, tea and tin foil, are taxed in the production area and inspected when imported into Shanghai. If the tea is indeed shipped for export, it will be exempt from commodity tax. Since the levy of various taxes, the tax revenue received has been more than 100 million yuan. In order to facilitate taxation, the Bureau has sent personnel to be stationed in various factories, but it has been found that most factories are in a state of shutdown.</p>
<h3>Japonica and Indica Rice Stagnate, Glutinous Rice Plunges, Wheat and Peanut Oil Prices Rise Gradually</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the digestion in both the northern and southern rice markets was sluggish. The registered volume of goods was more than 12,000 piculs. Southern indica and Changxi, Northern japonica, Pushu, and New japonica, all fell by more than 2,000 yuan. Yangpu indica and Du indica followed suit, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The origin of Baixian and Xianyuan goods, which were highly sought after in Gaoyao, has gradually increased, and they are seeing a decline in demand, with a sharp drop of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. The Minfang wheat continued to move, and prices rose gradually, rising by another 1,000 yuan. The demand for northern white wheat was quite strong, and only two withered in Shen, each rising by 2,000 yuan. Soybeans have been falling sharply for days, with slight inquiries in Shantou. Old beans were slightly firm amidst weakness, and new beans continued to decline by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. There was slight movement in soybeans from Nanyang, which were nominally stable but secretly firm. Sorghum was temporarily unchanged. The price of high-quality peanuts was stable, and the secondary and inferior ones remained sluggish. Red beans have been new in all areas, gradually arriving in Shen, the market is normal, and they continue to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Inferior goods are still less popular. Bean cakes continued to be down by 100 to 200 yuan, but wheat bran in Zhejiang was still acceptable, the market was strong, and it rebounded by 100 to 200 yuan. In the oil market, shipments from Qingdao were small, and Chao merchants were very greedy, continuing to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean oil was very scarce, and sesame oil was flat.</p>
<h3>Transport Tax Exemption Conditions, Self-Provided Tools for a Term of One Year</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Ministry of Finance has recently stipulated that the one-year preferential treatment of exempting transport businesses from business tax in recovered areas is limited to transport businesses with their own transport tools. As for the business of transit companies and customs brokers, which are of an agency nature, they are not within the scope of tax exemption. However, if transport firms, etc., transport with their own tools, the self-transported part can be exempted from taxation.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Four Factories Whose Electricity Supply Issues are Still Being Discussed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Among the 27 factories applied for by the Post-War Factory Restoration Association, 24 factories have been approved by the Enemy Property Management Bureau and relevant units. The remaining three factories are either because the application was too late or because there are property disputes, which still need to be considered. The Association yesterday hosted Mr. Zhao, Director of the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, to discuss future electricity supply issues. Mr. Zhao gave a detailed analysis of the electricity problems in this city and praised the fighting spirit of the post-war factory owners. He also instructed Xie Tiansha, the Director-General of the Association, to formally report to the Public Utilities Bureau the time when the factories need to start operations and the minimum amount of electricity needed for the record. The Association will be responsible for the allocation of electricity in the future. Once the electricity in this city increases by next spring, the supply will not be a problem.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Determined to Crack Down on Off-Exchange Trading</h3>
<p>In order to review its business, the Stock Exchange stipulates that it will hold a meeting of executive directors every Tuesday and a meeting of all directors and supervisors once a month to discuss various related issues. The Stock Exchange authorities are determined to crack down on off-exchange transactions. They are currently sending personnel to actively investigate the trading methods and locations of the black market. Concrete countermeasures have been decided and will soon be taken. At the same time, it is strictly forbidden for brokers to install walkie-talkies privately to prevent the abuse of "matched orders." Regarding the listing of government bonds, the types have been selected by the Stock Exchange and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. It is heard that the Ministry is very cautious about the selection of the types of government bonds to be listed. Once determined, trading can begin.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Stock Exchange Cleared</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th Special Telegram] The Stock Exchange recently held an extraordinary general meeting and decided to clear automatically.</p>
<h3>Banks Should Pay Even if the Draft Stub Has Not Arrived</h3>
<p>According to the usual practice of Chinese banks, if a remitter remits money from a bank in Location A to Location B, holding the demand draft issued by the bank in Location A and sends it to the payee. When the payee collects the money from the bank in Location B, the bank in Location B usually only allows payment after verifying that the draft and its stub or counter-stub are consistent. If it is a clean payment on delivery, the stub can be ignored. However, the Negotiable Instruments Law does not stipulate that payment should be made only after the stub is verified. It stipulates that the holder of the instrument should present it for payment on or within two days after the due date. If it is overdue by three days, the holder of the instrument can legally seek recourse from the bank. The legal provisions and customs are not entirely consistent. The Central Bank recently received a notice from the Joint Treasury forwarded from the Ministry of Finance, informing that banks should fulfill their payment obligations within the legal time frame in order to protect credit and facilitate customers. Moreover, the Negotiable Instruments Law stipulates that payment can be postponed for three days with the consent of the holder of the instrument, leaving room for maneuver. In addition to verifying the stub, there are other methods that can be used to identify the authenticity of the draft. Therefore, it will be much more convenient for payees to collect money from banks in the future.</p>
<h3>Jiao Zuo Coal Has Arrived</h3>
<p>Recently, because the order in the Jiao Zuo coal mining area has improved, the stored lump coal has gradually been transported to Shanghai, so the market price is gradually decreasing and has retreated within the 1 million yuan mark. Foreign coal, such as Delinasu small coal, has also been transported in small quantities, so the market situation for white coal lumps has gradually eased. Because no Yangquan lump coal has arrived, although the asking price has not changed, the transaction is very sparse, only wealthy public institutions purchase it for winter stove coal use. The market for bituminous coal and charcoal is calm, and the trend of firewood remains firm, especially tree firewood is most popular.</p>
<h3>China Economic Association Holds Sixth Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>The China Economic Construction Association is a purely private national entity. Since its establishment in 1938, its purpose has been to promote China's economic construction. In addition to engaging in research and investigation, it also publishes the Economic Construction Quarterly. The total number of members is now more than 700, all of whom are actual construction workers. With the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to strengthen the economic construction movement, the Association will hold its Sixth Annual Meeting in the capital on November 2nd and 3rd, and has appointed member Peng Shinian as the general person in charge of this year's annual meeting to prepare everything.

If you have any proposals, you can send them to Sun Gongdu of the Nanjing Resources Committee in advance.</p>
<h3>Rayon Market is Calm, Factory-Processed Silk Goods are Also Dull</h3>
<p>The rayon market has returned to calm. Unless the allocation price can be further reduced, the black market price may fall again. Yesterday, a No. 120 Tianjin Bridge trader had goods on the market, asking for 3.47 million yuan, but buyers were only willing to offer 4.2 million yuan, and no transaction was made. The asking prices of other numbers remained the same as yesterday. There were slight transactions of No. 150 goods. There is very little spot goods on the market, so the selling price is not easy to fall. However, silk merchants believe that there is no shortage of rayon, and the price is gradually stabilizing. They are all transforming rayon goods, and are gradually neglecting factory-processed goods. The transaction is unusually quiet, and only a dozen packages were traded on the market yesterday. Silk goods are hovering in a weak state. The selling price of rayon goods has gradually decreased because the raw material cost has been reduced. Although the asking price of pure silk goods remains the same, there are very few transactions.</p>
<p>The notice of the second phase of rayon allocation by the Central Trust Bureau was seen in yesterday's newspaper. According to the person in charge of the Government Material Property Committee of the Bureau, the Committee will start processing the application procedures for the rayon needs of the silk weaving industry for the next month from today, so that the allocation can be made from the first week of November. At the same time, the Committee has sent many people to conduct random checks on various factories to verify whether their production volume matches the application figures.</p>
<p>The Bureau has issued registration cards to dyeing and weaving industries and other industries that need rayon, asking them to fill in the forms. As for the weaving tape industry, because the three forms reported are inconsistent, they have been instructed to fill in accurate figures again. Once the procedures are completed, they can be allocated.</p>
<h3>Slight Rise in Sugar Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was tighter. Both Taiwanese coarse sugar and brown sugar experienced shortages and price increases. The trade association's quoted price for spot medium-grade white sugar rose by 2,000 yuan to 137,000 yuan. Raw red sugar was at 115,000 to 116,000 yuan, up 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Chaozhou brown sugar had not arrived yet, and Huanggang brown sugar was quoted at 125,000 yuan, but no transactions occurred. The opening price for thin-sliced Qingyuan brown sugar from Shimen was 100,500 to 102,000 yuan, while thicker Zhongzhuang brown sugar was at 97,000 to 98,000 yuan, with over 200 transactions. Xinghua tribute powder white sugar opened at 140,000 to 138,900 yuan, and red sugar at 127,000 yuan, with several hundred baskets traded. The inter-trade association quoted price for Diaozhou brown sugar was 115,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Professor Ryan of the United States Delivers Lecture at Ministry of Education - Modern Educational Trends Emphasize Breaking Down Class Barriers, Flexible Curricula, and Addressing Interpersonal and Social Relationships in Teaching - United States Recently Establishes Association for Early Childhood Education</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 22nd] The Ministry of Education invited Professor Ryan from the United States to deliver a lecture at the Ministry's auditorium yesterday (the 21st) at 3:00 PM. Over 400 people attended, including Ministry of Education staff, middle school teachers from Nanjing, and normal school students. The lecture was titled "Modern Educational Trends." Professor Ryan's lecture was translated by Ms. Xiong Zhi, and recorded by Mr. Ye, a Ministry of Education staff member. The main points of the lecture can be summarized as follows: (1) All aspects of education must be considered. (2) Children should receive a complete education. Break down the class system, teach according to aptitude, and group students according to individual characteristics and talent development. Curricula should be flexible and adaptable, not only in elementary schools but also in middle schools. (3) Teach according to environmental conditions. Teaching from books alone, discussing flowers and birds in the desert, or rivers and seas in the mountains, is mere empty talk on paper and difficult to achieve practical results. (4) The true meaning of education emphasizes the whole life. In addition to knowledge, pay attention to the development of emotions. For example, a nurse should not only rely on medicine for treatment but also provide gentle care and comfort to the patient to speed up recovery. (5) To achieve the goals of the new education, it is not just about the teaching materials; teachers must have a new perspective, understand the various relationships between people and society, and make these relationships the object of teaching. Otherwise, they can only teach books and not educate people. Professor Ryan also stated that this new educational trend is not unique to the United States; all countries in the world share the same trend. Recently, educationalists from sixteen countries in the United States have joined together to establish the Association for Early Childhood Education, which has issued a declaration stating that the barriers between schools and society should be opened up to create closer links and communication. The declaration also calls for changing the school system's excessive reliance on grades and rote learning, viewing schools as places for training cooperation and equality, and ensuring the livelihood stability of those engaged in education and encouraging outstanding young people to serve in education and work hard.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Youth Out of School, Gan Jiaxin, Appeals to Executive Yuan for Relief</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] Gan Jiaxin, Deputy Director of the National Youth Rehabilitation and Employment Guidance Committee, spoke to a Central News Agency reporter about relief measures for Northeastern youth out of school, saying: Recently, the number of unemployed and out-of-school youth flowing from the Communist areas into Changchun and other places has been increasing daily, which is indeed a serious problem. In addition to requesting the Executive Yuan to increase the budget for relief for out-of-school youth in the coming year, considering the special circumstances of the Northeast, we are also asking the Northeast Branch of the Executive Headquarters, Chief Du Yuming, and people from all walks of life to provide effective assistance.

It is reported that this number has increased compared to pre-war levels. According to Ministry of Education statistics, there were only 43,000 university students nationwide in 1936. The number has now more than doubled. However, given the vast territory of our country, the problem of students out of school remains very serious, and the lack of qualified teachers and their low pay also urgently require a solution.</p>

<h3>Youlian Wins Women's Team Final Spot in Guo Zhen Cup Volleyball Tournament - Wuben Eliminated 3-1 in Yesterday's Semi-finals - Men's Tournament: Guangdong Loses to Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] There were two semi-final matches in the Guo Zhen Cup Volleyball League last night. Both were evenly matched contests with a lot at stake, and the fighting was intense and exciting. In the women's division, Youlian defeated Wuben 3-1 to win a spot in the final. In the men's division, Guangdong lost to the Soviet Union 2-3.</p>
<p>Youlian Wins After Hard Fight</p>
<p>Since Wang Wuli transferred from Wuben to Youlian, the latter's strength has increased sharply and it seems to have a solid chance of winning the championship. However, Youlian's performance yesterday was obviously rusty, and there was a lack of coordination between the various positions. According to Chen Meizhen of Youlian, the team members have been neglecting practice due to their jobs and studies, which is not without reason. Wuben fought hard despite its disadvantage, so it posed a great threat to Youlian. Youlian won with great difficulty. Now that Youlian has defeated Wuben, it will meet Youdui in the final. Based on yesterday's battle, it will still have to make an effort.</p>
<p>In the women's division match between Youlian and Wuben, Lu Zhaoshan of Youlian served first, and Li Bo of Wuben missed, giving Youlian a point. The players of Wuben were cautious, and the scores remained close. At the end of the first set, Youlian took the lead with a score of 21-19. In the second set, Youlian once led 7-1, but Wuben chased and surpassed them 9-8. Youlian tried to recover, but Lu Cuifang's movements were slow, revealing a weakness that Wuben took advantage of. As a result, Wuben tied the score with a score of 21-14. The competition in the third set was even more intense, with the scores fluctuating and the tension palpable. After several ties, Youlian relied on Chen Meizhen's successful spikes to win the set 21-19 again. In the fourth set, Wuben once led 11-5, but Youlian chased to 14-11 and then took the lead. As a result, Youlian won 21-18 with a final effort, eliminating Wuben with an overall score of 3-1.</p>
<p>Guangdong Suffers Miserable Elimination</p>
<p>The Soviet Union was determined to win the championship. Having lost the league, it was even more ambitious for the Guo Zhen Cup. The same was true of Guangdong. Unfortunately, its star player Zheng Yiquan was unable to attend due to illness, which was a significant loss. Guangdong's defeat yesterday was entirely due to its weak spikes. The Soviet Union used both spikes and blocks, and had sufficient stamina. After the score became 2-2, Guangdong could not hold on.</p>
<p>In the men's semi-final, Guangdong and the Soviet Union took the court. Guangdong proceeded cautiously, and the scores were close. When the teams switched sides, Guangdong led 11-10. In the second half, the two sides engaged in close combat, and Guangdong won the first set 21-16. In the second set, the Soviet Union tried to rally and scored repeatedly, tying the score 21-12. The competition in the third set was even more intense. Guangdong trailed by 17 points, the situation was critical. It launched a counterattack, tying the score at 20. However, it lost the set again 21-23. In the fourth set, Guangdong suddenly found its rhythm, leading 11-6. As a result, Guangdong recovered its lost ground 21-16, tying the score at two games each. In the final set, both sides were cautious, and the game became even more tense. At 11-8, the Soviet Union became even more ferocious, and Guangdong suffered a crushing defeat of 13-21, and the Soviet Union defeated Guangdong 3-2 overall.</p>

<h3>Zhenglun-Huasheng Basketball Charity Game Tonight, 7:00 PM at the City Gymnasium</h3>
<p>The Huasheng basketball team from Tianjin will play its third game in Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to play against the Shantou team today. Now, because the Luoyang Zhenglun basketball team is about to leave Shanghai, the Basketball Committee has decided to have them play against Zhenglun first. At Huasheng's suggestion, Zhenglun and the Basketball Committee agreed to change it to a charity game. Tickets are priced at 3,000 yuan for the upper floor and 5,000 yuan for the lower floor. The ticket revenue will be discussed by the executive directors of the Sports Association, and the distribution method will be determined later. Military and police personnel will be admitted with tickets. During the break, charity balls will be auctioned to increase revenue. The game will start at 7:00 PM. Huasheng is purely a typical Northern style team. The qualifications of the players are good and they are experienced. Sha Zhenglong has arrived from Tianjin and will be in uniform to take the field. Wang Jinliang has also recovered from his illness, which has greatly increased the team's strength. It is expected that there will be an excellent performance. Zhenglun has played six games in Shanghai, with a mixed record of wins and losses, but their performance has not been weak.

<h3>Thunderous Destruction Crushes Zhangjiakou, One Gourd Spared From Total Destruction: More of a Funeral Procession Than a Tour!</h3>
<p>— Eighteenth Dispatch From Beiping, Our Reporter Song Shaobai</p>
<p>On the eighteenth, I, as a reporter, accompanied the "Chinese and Foreign Reporters' Tour Group to Zhangjiakou" from Beiping to Zhangjiakou. It was more of a "funeral procession" than a "tour." This official said solemnly during a speech at the Suiyuan Anniversary Week earlier this month: "Although we won the battle, there is only sorrow, not joy, because those who died were all Chinese!" Zhangjiakou experienced this disaster, and the destruction was entirely of the people of our country and their hard work.</p>
<p>At 8:30 in the morning, people boarded the plane. For the convenience of photographers, the plane circled over Beiping twice before flying northwest. Because it was uphill, it took a few more minutes to reach Zhangjiakou's airspace, where it circled for an hour. From the plane, Zhangjiakou, surrounded by mountains, looked like a gourd, an unsuitable place to defend. No matter Zhangbei to the north, Chaigoubu to the west, or Xuanhua to the east, once the attacking forces controlled them, the defending troops in this gourd would have to consider withdrawing as soon as possible. Zhangjiakou, this "gourd," seemed to have been spared from total destruction due to its terrain.</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou has two airfields. The larger one in Yulinbu has been completely destroyed by the communist army. From the plane, we could see the concrete runway riddled with bomb craters. We landed at the smaller Yaoguantun airfield. We boarded the trucks prepared by the Twelfth War Zone to enter the city and saw the aftermath of the disaster along the way.</p>
<p>Citizens Awaken From a Nightmare</p>
<p>As the trucks drove through the streets, we saw rows of people lining the sides, seemingly stretching endlessly. The reporters seemed excited, but those sitting on the ground did not stand up, nor did we hear cheers. Upon closer inspection, the triangular flags read, "Welcome to General Commander Chen, who has worked hard." The reporters understood. The people were all dazed and expressionless, showing neither joy nor sorrow, as if awakening from a nightmare, not yet fully clear. Most shops and houses had national flags hanging, but the colors and wrinkles did not look new. Later, when we asked a merchant, he said that they were not usually hung. Many people stood in front of the shops, seemingly watching the excitement without a clue. Aside from those clearing rubble and rows of stalls waiting for soldiers with legal tender, we saw few people working. Although small shops were open, they were desolate. Citizens did not have legal tender to buy things, and "border currency" had lost its value. (The slogans have been renewed.) On the bulletin boards, "Zhangjiakou Garrison Headquarters Notices" were posted. A crowd surrounded each notice. The plaques of "Liberation Hotel," "Xinhua Bookstore," "Jin-Cha-Ji..." hung high, but some had been burned. The Qingfeng Grand Theater announced "Drama performances begin today," and the brothels "×× Academy" and "×× Pavilion" were open as usual. Here, we could no longer see any traces of the "Mongolian Administration" period, replaced by our own destruction and slaughter.</p>
<p>The Station Is the Most Severely Damaged</p>
<p>The station was the most severely damaged. A long row of buildings was completely burned. Train cars were charred, and locomotives collided head-on. Undamaged machines were put together to form a locomotive, which is scheduled to be used today to connect Xuanhua and Zhangjiakou. The power plant was completely destroyed. Wires dragged on the streets, but a small generator had been repaired. Electricity was restored to the official's office on the seventeenth. Automatic telephone machines were completely burned. It is said that this is the most difficult to restore. Important components of the broadcasting station have been removed. A small radio station may be restored soon. The most fortunate thing is the water supply, which was saved by the factory workers, who secretly removed the fuse to the landmine.</p>
<p>With the stationing of troops, a "Temporary Political Affairs Committee of the Twelfth War Zone" has been established in Zhangjiakou to handle post-war affairs. The chairman of this committee is Zhou Jun, the deputy director of the political department of the Twelfth War Zone. The committee's urgent tasks include the following: land ownership issues, marriage issues, confessions and surrenders of communist party personnel, currency regulation, and emergency relief.</p>
<p>Restoring Land Ownership</p>
<p>Regarding land ownership, the commander has received instructions from the central government that, in principle, as long as the owner provides evidence (those who have lost evidence can have neighbors testify), their ownership can be restored regardless of the "struggle" they have undergone. However, in order to consider the losses of the cultivators, the cultivators' right to use and harvest is also recognized. Rent is not allowed to exceed 15% of the total harvest. If it has gone through more than two "struggles," the initial cultivator should get 35%, the intermediate cultivator should get 35%, the harvester should get 25%, and the landlord remains at 15%. This is a temporary measure until the end of the year, after which the "land limit policy" will be implemented according to the land law. The planned quota is about 20 mu per person, and no more than 200 mu for a family of five. The rent will be even less than the "25% rent reduction" method. Based on the actual situation, a standard similar to the current transitional method will be set, that is, the rent should not exceed 15% or 10%. According to Zhou Jun, chairman of the Temporary Political Affairs Committee, this method of limiting rent has already been implemented in western and eastern Suiyuan. It is 10% in western Suiyuan and 15% in eastern Suiyuan, accounting for about one-third of the province, and there has not been much difficulty. However, the difficulty in implementing the land limit method in the future is whether the central and local governments can raise enough money to buy the landlords' land and distribute it to the landless. According to his estimate, the local government can raise 10% or 20%. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether this policy can be effectively implemented next year. But according to Zhou, in order to practice the Principle of People's Livelihood and counter the Communist Party's set, this is necessary and urgent.</p>
<p>Currency Issues Are Troublesome</p>
<p>Currency issues are also a relatively troublesome issue at present. The "Border Region Currency" issued by the Communist Party has been banned. All that is available now is the 40 million legal tender that the Twelfth War Zone brought with them. The shortage of small denominations also needs to be resolved immediately. Therefore, the commander's office loaned the Chamber of Commerce 20 million and allowed them to issue temporary small-denomination circulating notes, which began to be used on the eighteenth. Zhangjiakou's prices have not yet been stimulated. Flour is 400 yuan per catty, rice is 500 yuan, and white cloth is 90,000 yuan per bolt. But people fear that the price increase after the resumption of traffic and when there is no shortage of currency will be alarming, because Zhangjiakou actually has very little left. Someone from the Central Bank arrived in Zhangjiakou on the same plane as the reporters to prepare for the establishment of a branch. Marriage issues are easier to resolve. The principle has been set that those without problems are free to choose, and those with problems are based on the woman's opinion.</p>
<p>Registering Workers</p>
<p>The number of unemployed workers in Zhangjiakou has not yet been counted. Including the workers of the Longyan Coal Mine in Xuanhua, there are no less than tens of thousands. There are many others who urgently need relief due to the war. For workers, the Temporary Political Affairs Committee decided to register them immediately, allow them to repair the damaged factories, and pay them 1,000 to 1,500 yuan per day, equivalent to relief in exchange for work. In addition, the Executive Yuan Relief Committee also had five people arrive on the same plane as the reporters, bringing 40 million in cash to handle emergency relief.</p>
<p>The Self-Confession Movement Is Very Effective. More than 2,500 people have confessed. The authorities announced that as long as they confess and obtain a guarantee from the Baojia, they will be given a chance to start anew and will not be held accountable for the past. At the same time, retaliatory actions are prohibited. It has been a week since Zhangjiakou was recovered, and no retaliatory actions have been seen. The general public seems to be very enlightened, which the authorities think is very good.</p>
<p>Textbooks Cause Panic</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou originally had more than 40 elementary schools, with tens of thousands of students. After this change, they have not suffered too much damage and have all resumed classes. The Chinese Communist Party textbooks have been abolished, but new textbooks have not yet been settled, which is an urgent problem to be solved. Schools above the secondary level previously included municipal middle schools for boys and girls, agricultural vocational schools, commercial vocational schools, railway colleges, medical vocational schools, industrial vocational schools, and Hui Muslim middle schools. The Inner Mongolia Military and Political Academy had two thousand students. In addition, there was the North China United University (a merger of Yan'an University, Lu Xun Academy of Art, Foreign Languages, and Education Academy), with an unknown number of students. When the Communist army withdrew, the students of these secondary and higher schools automatically or were forced to withdraw with the army. According to Secretary Wang of the Twelfth War Zone Commander's Office, about 6,000 students withdrew with the Communist army, of whom 800 were shot on the road for being ideologically unsound. Some have now returned one after another. The Communist Party's Jin-Cha-Ji Daily was published the day before the retreat, and before leaving, one of the three large rotary machines left in North China by the Japanese was destroyed into scrap iron. The Struggle Daily of Gui Sui published a Zhangjiakou edition three days ago.</p>
<p>Generals Are Humble</p>
<p>In Zhangjiakou, we met Generals Fu Zuoyi and Dong Qiwu, who were both wearing grass-green military uniforms that were exactly the same as the soldiers. They did not take victory as glory and were very humble. Commander Fu hoped that the reporters would contact anyone at will to know the real situation of Zhangjiakou before and after. Mr. Wang Mingde, Secretary-General of Commander Fu, accompanied the reporters for half a day. He said: The spirit of the officers and soldiers of the Twelfth War Zone is "Although the treatment is different, the life must be consistent." Small kitchens are not allowed, and officers and soldiers are completely consistent in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The reporter did not see any difference either.</p>

<h3>The Melancholy of Guangxi Women</h3>
<p>— Eleventh Dispatch From Guilin, Our Reporter Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>The most mysterious situation of "adopting sons-in-law" among the girls in the Zuojiang River area is that, for the sake of life, many women often take a fancy to some lonely strangers, and then bring them into their homes, entrusting themselves to their service (naturally, these women have already accumulated a lot of money from their labor). Occasionally, the husband misses his hometown and wants to return for a visit, which leads to the story of "releasing the thunder." The wife will try her best to provide her husband with unlimited generosity to "return in glory," but strictly instructs him on the date of return. If he returns to his wife's house on schedule, naturally nothing will happen. If he overstays his return date, nine out of ten times his belly will swell and he will pass away. These fragrant and terrifying legends still circulate in Guangxi, becoming excellent material for unofficial history.</p>
<p>The Yao girls of the remote southern country grow up in the Garden of Eden of song, dance, and love. Singing is their spring. Their sweet dreams, the secluded forests and streams in the thousands of valleys, the grassy riverbanks with a view of a thousand feet on the plains, are filled with different languages and loud singing, so gentle, pure, and lovely. The women in the vast mountain villages of southeastern Guilin have always passionately worshiped a singing goddess, believing in the myth of her singing voice. It is said that the name of the singing fairy is Liu Sanjie, a native of Longshan Township, Guixian County, on the banks of the Yujiang River (her name, like the nationally renowned ethnic hero Wing King Shi Dakai, is deeply imprinted in the hearts of the people of Guixian County, taken as supreme glory). This beautiful farm girl loved to sing mountain songs from birth. Whether it was herding cattle, planting rice, weeding fields, cutting thatch... her charming voice could be heard resonating in the quiet sky at any time. A song by the river, a few cries, intoxicated the strong young men, teased the youthful teenagers, and brought down the smile of the earth... However, an ugly fate brought her the bullying, torment, and jealousy of her sister-in-law, who was determined to kill this innocent little sister-in-law. So, one day, under the pretense of chopping firewood, she took Sanjie to a very steep mountain peak and then pushed her forward, thinking that she had ended Sanjie's life and singing. Who knew that just as Sanjie was falling in the air, she grabbed a thousand-year-old vine, swaying in the middle of the abyss, facing the rapidly rushing stream. Sanjie's singing rang out again: "Sister-in-law wants to harm Liu Sanjie, thanks to a thousand-year-old vine." As the song ended, a stone door on the cliff opened with a "ya" sound. Liu Sanjie took her singing and walked into the cave, becoming a singing fairy. The story is light and interesting. Liu Sanjie's soul lives forever in the hearts of the girls. Many people sing, "If you don't believe it, just look at Liu Sanjie, her singing should surpass the nine heavens." Singing not only surpasses the nine heavens, but also brings together the girls in the free mountain country. When the year is coming to an end and spring is approaching, when the plums are cold and the peaches are bright, occasionally there is an unprecedented program in the mountain village (such as the Spring Festival in agricultural factories, the Pangu Festival in the Yao area of ​​western Guilin, the Egg-Throwing Festival in the Wanggang area...). The men and women of the entire village are completely immersed in crazy song and dance. The bright moon shines on people, the flowing water sets the tune, and a gust of mountain wind sweeps across the plain. The wonderful love surrounds the deep pine forest. The woman sings, "The stars in the sky disappear and reappear, a Milky Way is cold and clear, if anyone can count the stars, I will fly into the sky with wings." The man answers, "The stars in the sky shine every night, it's not that I can't count them, I'm most afraid of counting to the end of the stars, and my darling won't walk the Milky Way." One sings, one responds, and Venus and Cupid's love arrows lightly pierce their hearts. When the moon sets and the crows cry, and the dawn urges people, many lovers have already taken each other's hands and stepped into the girl's father's house to make it clear, followed by a betrothal (the Yao people in southwestern Guilin want several cows and white rice, while the Yao area of ​​Dageng Mountain likes to have hundreds of pieces of white silver dollars. Speaking of the Yao area of ​​Dageng Mountain, there is still a "prince consort" of the Jinxiu Yao King, who was a popular figure in the former provincial government, but the reason why this prince consort was able to "marry the princess" was not because of singing but because of appeasement). Thus, thanks to the legacy of the singing fairy, another pair of lovers became a family. This is the spring of the Yao country, and also a page of poetry in the mountains.</p>
<p>However, the end of the tragicomedy is often that women suffer the most painful sacrifices. The war and famine of the past two years have devastated the body of Guangxi. More than six million women have suffered double the pain. Grass roots and tree bark have blocked their innocent singing voices. Hunger and poverty threaten the survival of their husbands and children. Many pure souls have sold their cheap bodies. Many bright pearls on the road have helplessly become other people's concubines. Infinite sorrow teaches them to shed endless tears like Lin Daiyu. Empty stomachs teach them to live a life more tragic than Zhao Wuniang. What happiness has the heavens bestowed on the women of Guangxi?</p>

<h3>Visiting Chairman You Yongchang of the China Zhonghe Party</h3>
<p>— Twelfth Dispatch From Guangzhou, Our Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>The name "China Zhonghe Party" seems to have rarely been seen in the past. I believe many people feel a little unfamiliar with this party. Therefore, when local newspapers revealed the news of the Zhonghe Party leader's arrival in Guangzhou, citizens speculated in the streets: "Probably another new political party has emerged." Even reporters had the same feeling. So, on a crisp autumn afternoon, the reporter, with a curious mood, went to Room 715 of the New Asia Hotel to interview Mr. You Yongchang, the chairman of the party.</p>
<p>Mr. You is now sixty-one years old. His face is thin, with high cheekbones and sunken cheeks, sunken eyes and a prominent nose. The white hair on his head and the silver beard hanging from his lips are harmoniously matched. When he received the reporter, he always had a kind smile, giving people the feeling of talking to a kind elder.</p>
<p>The Shen, You, and Xian Surnames Were Originally One Family</p>
<p>Mr. You's surname was originally the "尢" character without the dot on top of the "于" character. Therefore, many people pronounce it differently. Some pronounce it as the "尤" character, and some pronounce it as the "汪" sound. The reporter first asked about this, and he explained the origin of the surname. He said that their ancestor was originally Shen. Later, after a rebellion, the Qiren were scattered and divided into the Shen, Xian, and You surnames. In fact, they are all one family. Their original home was Wuxi, Jiangsu. Later, the You surname settled in Shunde County, Guangdong. As for this "尢" character, it should be pronounced the same as "注," but everyone calls me Mr. You, so I have to be surnamed "尤." He only explained his surname and didn't mind explaining it for several minutes, which also shows that he is a talkative person.</p>
<p>The History of the Zhonghe Party Has Been Around for Sixty Years</p>
<p>The conversation turned to the main topic. Mr. You gave the following overview of the history and current situation of the Zhonghe Party in response to the reporter's questions:</p>
<p>"The Zhonghe Party was founded by my late father, You Lie, in the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. It was established on the nineteenth day of the third month of the Dingchou year, and its history has been around for sixty years. At that time, it was a political party organized separately with the same ideology as the late Premier Sun after the Xingzhonghui. Mr. Sun and Mr. You were born in the same year, started the uprising at the same time, and fled to Tokyo and the Americas at the same time to lobby for the revolution. At that time, the Qing government called the four major bandits of the revolution the Premier, my late father, and Mr. Chen Shaobai and Mr. Yang Heling. For decades, the Zhonghe Party was led by my late father, You Lie. After my late father passed away, comrades at home and abroad elected me to succeed him. There are currently about three million members, mostly overseas Chinese workers in various ports in the South Seas, but there are also many in the country. The provinces north of the Yangtze River account for about 300,000. Although a correct survey has not been conducted on the number of party members in Guangzhou, it is believed that it is always more than tens of thousands, because most of the Zhonghe Party members are 'hereditary,' so they will only increase and not decrease. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, I went to Qujiang, Guilin, and other places from Hong Kong to mobilize party members to participate in the work of resisting the war. There was a time when I lost contact with party members in various places due to the interruption of traffic. Now I am planning to re-investigate and implement the revitalization of party affairs. Currently, the Central Executive Committee is located in Kowloon, Hong Kong, and will soon be moved to Shanghai."</p>
<p>A Historic National Seal Will Be Presented to the Government</p>
<p>Mr. You spoke eloquently, seemingly becoming more and more excited as he spoke, with a very proud look on his face. Then, he said:</p>
<p>"I am here to inspect the party affairs of the Zhonghe Party in Guangzhou. Soon, I will accompany the national representatives with Zhonghe Party membership to Beijing to present the 'Long Live the Republic of China' national seal to the National Government at the National Congress. This national seal was engraved in the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu when the Premier and my late father decided on the national title 'Republic of China' in Tokyo. The seal is made of ivory, about one square inch in size, and is engraved with six seal characters 'Long Live the Republic of China,' with two lions on top, which is very delicate. On New Year's Day in 1901, the Zhonghe Party started using it at the first congress in Tokyo. Later, it was also used on Chairman Chiang's 51st birthday, but it has rarely been used since then."</p>
<p>The Delay in Presenting the National Seal Is in Accordance With Family Instructions</p>
<p>After he finished this paragraph, the reporter had some doubts. Since it is called the national seal, why was it not presented to the National Government earlier? His answer was this:</p>
<p>"My late father had long planned to present this seal to the Premier. The Premier said that this was a national treasure and instructed my late father to hand it over only when the national revolution was completed and the National Congress was convened. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the central government telegraphed my late father to Beijing to discuss national affairs, and my late father planned to present it to the National Congress at that time to show solemnity. However, later, due to the serious national crisis, the National Congress was suspended, and my late father unfortunately passed away in the capital. Before he passed away, he instructed me to present it at the opening of the National Congress, so it has been kept until now!"</p>
<p>Finally, he said: "My late father was a founding hero, and his revolutionary achievements are outstanding. He was selfless and dedicated his life to public service, and lived a simple life with noble ambitions. He was very friendly with Mr. Zou Haibin, Mr. Ju Juesheng, and Mr. Dai Jitao. After his death, he was publicly buried in Beijing, and friends founded You Lie Memorial Middle School in Hong Kong. The school's name was inscribed by Chairman Chiang. Currently, Guangdong comrades also have the intention of establishing a branch school here, and I also feel that cultivating talents during the period of national construction is the current urgent task!"</p>
<p>When he said this with emotion, the reporter still wanted to ask questions, but Mr. You had other social engagements, so the reporter had to leave.</p>
<p>Ten-Character Claim for Opinions on the Current Situation</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to report one thing here. The Zhonghe Party will issue a letter to Chairman Chiang of the National Government on the current situation on September 9 of this year. Although the content has not been published, the party has publicly issued ten major claims on the current political views, with the content being the supremacy of the country and nation, the primacy of recovery and construction, the immediate cessation of the civil war, and sincere cooperation towards the nation.</p>

<p>International Knowledge Published Every Wednesday</p>
<h3>The Danube River Has Many Troubles The Struggle Between the United States and the Soviet Union Over Navigation Rights Affects European Peace</h3>
<p>The United States has recently been fighting for an issue vital to European peace in two international conferences: the unrestricted use of the 1,750-mile-long Danube River for international trade. At the Paris Peace Conference, over Soviet opposition and after the United States withdrew its special proposals, a vague proposal to convene a special conference to internationalize the Danube River was passed. At the same time, at Lake Success, the United Nations Economic and Social Committee passed a similar U.S. proposal. But countries under Soviet control have vowed to refuse to attend any international conference that opposes their sole management of the Danube.</p>
<p>Therefore, this issue cannot help but arise again, making it difficult for the United Nations to deal with. The following is a dispatch from Vienna by Howard, the Berlin correspondent of U.S. Newsweek, detailing the various important factors behind this complex issue.</p>
<p>The Viennese have a witty satire based on Strauss's waltz, called "The United States Occupies the Vienna Woods, the Soviet Union Occupies the Blue Danube." The reason is that American officials and their families live in the stately houses in the "Vienna Woods" in the American occupation zone of Vienna, while the stretch of the Danube River and its tributaries from Enns in Upper Austria to the Black Sea is under Soviet control.</p>
<h3>American Control of One-Fifth</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zuo Xi</p>
<p>In reality, the United States controls one-fifth of the Danube River's total length, including a narrow upstream section from Ulm in Baden-Württemberg to Linz within the American occupation zone of Austria. From there, it extends along the southern bank to Enns, where the Soviets have placed underwater cables. In the river section above Linz, the Americans possess one-third of the Danube River fleet. This fleet comprises 971 vessels from Austria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Hungary, France, Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries. These ships were used to transport retreating German expatriates and supplies during the final months of the war, or they fled upstream after the war to avoid capture by Soviet forces. Among them are 34 passenger ships, 105 tugboats, 55 motor barges and tankers. The rest are ordinary barges, oil barges, crane ships and other assorted vessels.</p>
<p>American engineers have cleared the river channel in Germany from Linz to Regensburg and have established three Danube shipping companies to manage navigation on a 296-mile stretch of the river within the American occupation zone. These three companies are the Bavarian Danube Shipping Company (DDSG), the Bavarian Lloyd Shipping Company, and the Comos Shipping Company, which is owned by Bavaria but chartered by the Netherlands. Of the 971 vessels, 390 are assets of the Danube Shipping Company. All the ships and other equipment of this company within the Soviet occupation zone were confiscated last winter by the Soviets as "German assets" under the Potsdam Agreement. Therefore, the company has requested that the Americans not allow the ships to sail until the issue of the Danube Shipping Company's sovereignty is resolved. The company demands that the Soviet side return the confiscated dock equipment and 220 vessels. Although the Austrian Parliament has nationalized the company, making it an asset of the Austrian government, the Soviet Union continues to occupy and operate these vessels and equipment under the name of the Danube Shipping Company.</p>
<p>The Blue Disappears</p>
<p>There is a Viennese saying that the Danube always appears blue in the eyes of a lover. But in fact, this putty-colored river that winds around Vienna like a dead snake shows no trace of blue. Seen from the sky, it resembles a flypaper, covered with dilapidated docks and warehouses, scattered with collapsed bridges, and the protruding hulls of various sunken ships. Viennese people like to gather along the riverbank, resting and reading under the trees, and even brave swimmers venture into this river. However, the stretch from Linz to below Vienna is entirely stagnant, foul-smelling water, with no ships sailing on it. The port of Vienna, with its ten-mile long docks and wharves, used to handle 1.7 million tons of shipping annually before the war, but now it is silted up and desolate.</p>
<p>According to the Soviets, the choke point of the Danube is the Tulln bridge, about fifteen miles from Vienna, which was destroyed by Hitler's guards. All five spans of the bridge are broken and submerged in the river. Recovering the Tulln bridge from the riverbed must be carried out in dangerous rapids and requires specially trained engineers, workers, and underwater equipment, all of which the Soviets lack. Austrian engineers estimate that, under normal conditions, with appropriate tools and labor, the bridge could be completely recovered in 30 to 40 days. However, the Soviets, using only one crane and a few Austrian workers, have only recovered one span of the bridge in nine months.</p>
<p>State of Stagnation</p>
<p>In the second week of July of this year, the Soviet Danube Shipping Headquarters in Budapest, Hungary, sent a circular to all shipping companies under Soviet control, announcing that the section of the Danube River from Vienna to the Black Sea was open for navigation. Companies only needed to give 24 hours' notice to confirm weather and river conditions and could freely use that section of the river. Only the Czech shipping company has accepted this Soviet proposal, in order to transport 2,000 tons of wood pulp from Bulgaria to Bratislava, Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Below Bratislava, the extent of navigational hazards, tariff regulations, border inspections, various taxes, and loading and unloading fees are unclear, and there are many restrictions. Even the extent of Soviet control is unknown.</p>
<p>There is no regular commercial transport on the Danube. Only about 300 ships operate in Bulgaria, Romania, and Yugoslavia, and about 30 to 50 operate in Hungary. However, due to the danger of mines and obstacles, transport is limited to one-way transactions and is extremely risky. British and American officials are well aware that the Soviets currently control the northern estuary leading to the Black Sea, but they admit that they know nothing about the situation at the other two estuaries and the Sulina branch to the Black Sea.</p>
<p>It is a very obvious fact that before World War II, the Danube was the trade artery of seven Central European countries, with a total of about 3,000 ships traveling to and fro, handling 3.5 million to 4 million tons of cargo annually. Now, however, it is in a state of stagnation. While Europe is looking forward to a peaceful resolution, these seven countries could have rebuilt their collapsed economies through Danube trade, but instead they are eking out a living on UN relief supplies and a small amount of freight.</p>

<h3>Potsdam</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zuo Qi</p>
<p>After Germany surrendered in May 1945, the three major powers, Britain (Churchill and Attlee), the United States (Truman), and the Soviet Union (Stalin), held a meeting in Potsdam in July to lay the foundation for lasting world peace and discuss plans to intensify the war against Japan. On July 26, Churchill and Truman, with the consent of Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek, jointly issued the Potsdam Declaration. Within two weeks, Japan accepted the declaration and surrendered. As a result, the name "Potsdam" became famous worldwide and became a news term in newspapers.</p>
<p>Potsdam is located about eighteen miles southwest of Berlin, Germany, on the Havel River. The area is beautifully scenic and has historically been the site of German imperial residences, with magnificent buildings. The Potsdam Conference was held in the old imperial palace.</p>
<p>Earlier, there were reports that the three major powers would meet again in Potsdam to discuss intractable international disputes, but this did not materialize.</p>
<p>Recently, the American Association for Chinese Policy accused the government of having made secret agreements concerning China at the Potsdam Conference and demanded that they be announced, but the US State Department denied this.</p>

<h3>From Paris to New York, the Focus Remains on the US and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>The Paris Peace Conference has ended, and representatives from various countries have returned home. Paris, which was bustling for two months and eighteen days, has suddenly become quiet. The world's attention has also shifted from Paris to New York across the Atlantic. Not only is the United Nations General Assembly scheduled to open in New York on the 23rd of this month, but the Council of Foreign Ministers is also scheduled to meet in New York on the 4th of next month. The United States is currently experiencing a meat shortage, and the general public "has no meat to eat." Now that a large number of international dignitaries are arriving, the US authorities must do their best to entertain them with fine cuisine, making the shortage even more severe.</p>
<p>Peace Is Not Easy to Achieve</p>
<p>If we close our eyes and imagine for a moment, we can see that achieving world peace is not an easy task. The European war ended a year and a half ago, and the Pacific war ended more than a year ago, but true peace has not yet arrived in the world. Politicians and diplomats from various countries are working hard for peace, holding one international conference after another, trying their best to restore the post-war world to normalcy as soon as possible, so that all countries can share peace and no longer face the threat of wars of aggression. However, after a year and a half of effort, only draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland have been completed, while other important issues, because the Council of Foreign Ministers failed to resolve them, were transferred to the Paris Peace Conference for discussion. The Paris Peace Conference failed to resolve them, and now they have been transferred back to the Council of Foreign Ministers. This is like going around in a big circle, returning to the original starting point. The problems themselves remain as they were, without any resolution. The people of the world, having suffered the great calamity of this war, have learned from their pain and are eagerly seeking peace. As long as there is a ray of hope, they hope that it will suddenly become clear. At first, they placed all their hopes on the Council of Foreign Ministers, but after disillusionment, they placed their hopes on the Paris Peace Conference. Now the Paris Peace Conference has again made the world feel the sadness of disillusionment. However, the world's hopes are now shifting to the United Nations General Assembly, and even the future Council of Foreign Ministers.</p>
<p>The world's attention shifts with hope, but where is peace after all? It remains an impenetrable riddle.</p>
<p>An Episode at the End of the Conference</p>
<p>The final meeting of the Paris Peace Conference was presided over by Guo Taiqi, the acting head of the Chinese delegation, who praised the conference and hoped that all countries would eliminate their prejudices and work for peace. US Secretary of State Byrnes also said, "Countries should recognize each other. No country can win a war alone, nor can it achieve peace alone in peacetime. Countries must work together to benefit humanity." Afterwards, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also delivered speeches successively, and finally, French Foreign Minister Bidault gave the closing speech. The conference thus came to an end. However, the representative of Yugoslavia was not seen at the meeting that day. According to a letter he sent to Guo Taiqi, the chairman of the final session, Yugoslavia did not approve of the peace treaty with Italy passed by the conference and had decided to withdraw from the conference. The achievements of the Paris Peace Conference were already mediocre enough, and to expose such a major weakness at the end is truly disheartening.</p>
<p>The Focus Remains on the US and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly has decided to open as scheduled, and the Council of Foreign Ministers will also be held in New York. Therefore, everyone wants to ask: will there be good results? Our answer is: "The key to success or failure still lies in the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union." Therefore, the world pays special attention to the speech delivered by Byrnes on the 18th. The content of the speech includes the following points: (1) The American people are willing to extend a hand of friendship to the Soviet Union; (2) Rumors that the United States has adopted a policy of containment toward the Soviet Union are entirely based on fantasy; (3) Promoting understanding between the US and the Soviet Union is the most difficult task facing politicians and diplomats today; (4) The United States will continue to oppose policies of individual alliances; (5) The most worrying aspect of the current international situation is that the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union has reached an impasse.</p>
<p>Byrnes's words were not only fully agreed upon by President Truman, but even his political opponent Wallace expressed satisfaction, believing that Byrnes had made progress, but still hoped that he would continue to make progress. Senator Vandenberg's speech also supported Byrnes's policy, saying, "Neither the Soviet Union nor the United States wants war. I hope everyone will stop talking about war. The foreign policy of the United States is a policy of peace, and it will succeed if it is not undermined domestically."</p>
<p>Trade Conference Held in England</p>
<p>The international trade and employment conference initiated by the United States began its preparatory meetings in London on the 15th, discussing the US proposals. Representatives from nineteen countries attended, but the Soviet Union did not participate. US representative Wilcox put forward five basic principles for the revival of the world economy: (1) Substantially reduce tariff barriers; (2) Countries should exchange goods with each other; (3) No country should discriminate against imported goods; (4) Countries should maintain a high level of employment; (5) All countries should be equal in the international market.</p>
<p>If we study the real motive behind the US's initiation of this conference, it is to restore freedom to post-war international trade. In principle, this is agreed upon by all countries; but in reality, there are still difficulties. First, the non-participation of the Soviet Union inevitably makes the scope of so-called international trade too narrow. Second, Britain and France cannot temporarily abolish their restrictions on imported goods. Third, economically backward countries must adopt "moderate protection" in order to implement industrialization. Fourth, the US's advocacy of the international free trade movement inevitably carries the color of economic imperialism.</p>
<h3>Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak: A Key Mediator Between Large and Small Countries</h3>
<p>— Translated by Jia Nan from "World Report Magazine"</p>
<p>Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak is now an important mediator between large and small countries. He will once again serve as chairman when the United Nations General Assembly meets in New York on October 23. The working principle of this socialist politician is to be realistic and pragmatic. In his youth, he was an agitator of social movements and had smashed the windows of conservative newspapers, but age and a sense of responsibility gradually turned him into a rational person who advocated reason. For example, at the Paris Peace Conference, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt used direct language to force the four powers to make concessions, but Spaak used gentle language and compromise methods.</p>
<p>The great powers resolutely rejected Evatt's demand that a majority resolution should be binding on the four powers. But when Spaak, as chairman of the rules committee, suggested that the great powers should automatically adopt proposals passed by a two-thirds majority, he won the support of US Secretary of State Byrnes.</p>
<p>When Spaak serves as chairman of international conferences, he is calm and accurate, truly representing the typical figure of objectivity and impartiality. He represented Belgium in international tennis competitions in 1922, and his flexibility and quick-wittedness on the court can be compared to his eloquence at the conference table.</p>
<p>Tactful Approach</p>
<p>When Spaak is chairman, debates rarely become deadlocked. In situations where the four powers face a stalemate, the Belgian Foreign Minister can often propose a tactful approach.</p>
<p>At the Paris Peace Conference, Spaak once told the representatives of various countries that their endless disputes would make people in the world think that they were not setting the terms for the Axis powers, but arguing about peace among themselves.</p>
<p>When Spaak is chairman, he never allows any representative to take advantage of the rules. In handling conference work, he attaches more importance to the spirit of the rules than to the letter of the rules. When there is a mistake due to confusion in the meeting, his attitude is tolerant, but if someone deliberately violates the rules to achieve their own advantageous purpose, his attitude is extremely firm.</p>
<p>In his youth, Spaak led socialists to parade and smash the windows of right-wing newspapers. In his twenties, he was an excellent lawyer and first attracted attention. He defended communists and wrote fiery pamphlets and speeches for young socialists. But when he became Prime Minister of Belgium at the age of 39, he was already the leader of the right wing of the Socialist Party and an opponent of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Outstanding Talent</p>
<p>Spaak is the son of Belgium's first famous female socialist member of parliament. His father was a poet who wrote the most successful play of the time. In 1938, he became Prime Minister of Belgium.</p>
<p>During World War II, Spaak fled to France and was detained by the Vichy government. He then fled to Spain and was detained by Franco. He escaped from prison, disguised as a monk, passed through Portugal, and arrived in London, rejoining the Belgian government.</p>
<p>Spaak was first elected to parliament in 1932 and became a cabinet minister in 1935, serving as foreign minister the following year. Since then, he has held this position almost continuously. He is now the foreign minister of the coalition government of the Liberal, Socialist, and Communist parties.</p>
<p>In 1937, Spaak participated in King Leopold's negotiations, which resulted in Belgium breaking away from its military alliance with France and Britain. But isolationism did not save Belgium from aggression, just as neutrality did not save Belgium from crisis in the First World War.</p>
<p>But Spaak differed from King Leopold in that he fled abroad to continue the resistance. Today, he opposes Leopold's surrender to the Nazis and does not approve of his return to the country. Spaak now advocates close relations with Britain and France and the establishment of a joint defense agreement, but he insists that this is not the organization of a "Western bloc."</p>
<p>This policy has led the Soviet Union to oppose him serving as chairman of the United Nations General Assembly. But after seeing Spaak's actual actions, the Soviet side had to admit that he was an excellent chairman.</p>
<p>When the United Nations General Assembly meets in New York on October 23, he will once again appear before the representatives of various countries as a mediator between large and small countries.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Japan's Defeat: Japanese Journalist Kato Reveals the Truth About Japan Before Surrender</h3>
<p>A recent book by famous Japanese journalist and current chief editor of Kyodo News, Kato, titled "Record of Defeat," has been published. It states that even before the atomic bombs fell on Japan, American submarines had already dealt Japan a significant blow. A month before the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Emperor Hirohito wanted to seek peace through the Soviet Union. Before that, Japan had repeatedly probed China for peace. Kato writes his article in the style of ordinary news reporting, beginning with: "Japan was already struggling in the throes of death. The sudden arrival of the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima was only the final blow that hastened its demise. The world's newest and most powerful weapon emerged from the summer sky and destroyed the city with just one blow, but its appearance did not have a major impact on the outcome of the Japanese-American War."</p>
<p>Kato appeals to United Nations readers about the mistakes of Japanese totalitarianism. He recounts the mutual suspicion between the Japanese army, navy, and civilians, the mismanagement of skilled Japanese workers, and the poor planning in all aspects of the war. He also harshly criticizes the ridiculous posture of the Japanese army pretending to be calm and covering up the truth when Japan was on the verge of collapse. He further describes the enslaved state of the Japanese newspapers, which were at a loss when they finally regained their freedom.</p>
<p>At the historic meeting held by the cabinet and other leaders on August 14, the Prime Minister first reviewed the general situation, after which the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Navy, as well as the Minister of the Army, appealed to the Emperor to reaffirm the national policy and continue the war. At this point, the Cabinet Secretary quoted the Emperor as saying, "If others have no opinions to express, we will express our opinions. We are determined to have you agree to this... We believe that there is only one way left to save Japan."</p>
<p>Kato criticizes the propaganda on both the Japanese and American sides, saying: "In my personal opinion, Japan's propaganda in the Philippines was the most unsuccessful, while its propaganda in Burma was the most successful. The main reason for the success was the racial appeal and promises. The failure was due to the inability to replace the Anglo-American trend and the inability or unwillingness to fulfill promises. Especially in the Philippines, with the sudden cessation of the supply of American cars, refrigerators, and modern equipment, the natives quickly lost confidence in the Japanese's empty talk of co-prosperity."</p>

<h3>George Bernard Shaw</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yinhuai</p>
<p>Shaw is ninety years old. July 26 was his birthday. George Bernard Shaw did not like celebrating birthdays, and twenty years ago he swore that he would not celebrate a second one. That was in 1926, when he wrote: "For all these praises of me, I can receive them with pride. Only this is my first birthday celebration, and also the last one I plan to celebrate." For this reason, his friends: HG Wells, Professor Murray, Mansfield, Priestley, A. Huxley, and Xiong Shiyi, etc., each wrote a memorial or research article, compiled into a special collection to show their respect and love.</p>
<p>This old man is not really old. Although he is an antique of the modern literary world who has been with Victorian writers and experienced two world wars, few people feel the burden of his age. People only think that he is a great writer of this century, who has written two modern masterpieces: "Saint Joan" and "Man and Superman"; but they do not know that most of his life has become history. Among the writers of his generation were Kipling, Hardy, and Wilde. And when his first play (Rhinegold) was published, Tennyson and Browning were still alive.</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw was born in Dublin, Ireland. His father was a humorous drunkard; his mother was a very accomplished singer. The family was poor, so he spent the first thirty years of his life in poverty. Throughout his life, he was a wise man who had not received much formal education; but he had read almost all the famous works on the planet. He loved music because his mother was a very accomplished musician, allowing the children to grow up listening to the music of Beethoven and Handel from an early age.</p>
<h3>Shaw (Oil Painting)</h3>
<p>— Clare Winsten</p>
<p>In 1876, Shaw moved to London with his family. He tried to write over a thousand words every day, and after ten years of hard work, he completed five novels and hundreds of short essays, but only sold them for a total of six pounds. During those years, he relied on his mother to make a living, thereby obtaining the leisure time to write.</p>
<p>From the age of twenty-six, he became a vegetarian—partly for humanitarian reasons, and partly for health. He despised meat-eaters. It is said that once, he and the meat-loving sculptor Rodin mocked each other because of this. Shaw was not only an ascetic in terms of appetite, but also an ascetic in terms of sexual desire. He was a Puritan. Although he had a playful epistolary romance with the famous actress Ellen Terry at the time, she always faithfully loved his wife, who had passed away three years ago.</p>
<p>In 1884, Shaw joined the Fabian Society, which had been founded only a year before, and enthusiastically promoted the socialist movement in the streets. Three years later, he shifted his focus from the working class to intellectuals, and his sharp and quick eloquence conquered many people.</p>
<p>Shaw was not only a social critic, but also an authority in the music and drama criticism circles. He wrote drama reviews for three years for "Saturday Review," which was edited by his friend Harris. This was a high-end publication in London at the time, and Shaw's position in the literary world had already been firmly established due to his sharp and witty writing style.</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw's humor and wit are known throughout the world, and everyone regards him as a playful jester. In fact, he is an idealist wearing a clown's mask. He himself considers himself a prophet of the times, but whether this is the case will have to be left to time to make the final judgment.</p>
<p>However, his cold satire and hot sarcasm are only superficial forms, temporary tools—this is true. He himself once said: "If I didn't say it with a laugh, I'm afraid no one would be able to stand it." Beneath this mask of satire is an Irishman's passionate heart, a strong love for humanity, and broad sympathy. He always tries to improve the situation of the working poor, and often pays out of his own pocket to help them. As Chesterton said: Comedians are often the most serious people in the world. In public, he is certainly sharp-tongued and likes to mix laughter and ridicule; in private life, he is a quiet, friendly, and gentle gentleman.</p>
<p>Shaw has now established a brilliant position in literary history, and people often compare him to Shakespeare. (Shakespeare is one of the people he admires most.) Along with honor comes wealth, of course. Plays have brought Shaw a great deal of money. For many years, he was the highest-paid playwright in the world; recently, he has become the highest-paid screenwriter for film. Films based on his plays have to pay him one-tenth of the total revenue. The films that have already been made include "Pygmalion" and "Major Barbara," and the new film "Caesar and Cleopatra" has recently been completed. Therefore, when the British side wanted to award him the highest honor, he simply refused; he believed that the name George Bernard Shaw no longer needed unnecessary embellishments.</p>
<p>Shaw's important plays include the following: "Arms and the Man" (first performed in 1894). "Candida" (1894). "The Devil's Disciple" (1897). "Caesar and Cleopatra" (1898). "Man and Superman" (1903), first performed in May 1905. "Major Barbara" (November 1905). Later, he also wrote "Pygmalion" and his last famous play "Saint Joan" (1923), as well as many famous works on economics. It is said that he is still writing a play even now.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes about Shaw</h3>
<p>— Huai</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw's humor is world-renowned. Once, a beautiful actress (not the dancer Duncan) wrote to him to propose marriage. She said: "Your brain plus my figure, we will produce the perfect child." But Shaw replied: "What if that child inherits my figure and your brain?"</p>
<p>Humor is humor, but most scholars, although they admire Shaw's intellectual enlightenment, do not appreciate his clownish face. He himself is among these people. One evening, after a performance of "Arms and the Man," Shaw was invited to take a bow as the author. At the end of a burst of enthusiastic applause, there was a sudden cold "boo." Shaw raised both hands to calm the frenzied crowd. Then he turned around to face the direction of the boos and said: "I agree with you, my friend. But the opinion of everyone in the room is exactly the opposite of ours. What can the two of us do?"</p>
<p>In 1925, he refused the Nobel Prize in Literature. His reason for refusing was very interesting: he did not need the money. The money was worth about US$35,000. He said: "Like a lifebuoy to a swimmer who has already safely reached the shore, it is useless."</p>

<h3>Shaw's Daily Life</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw has a three-story villa in Ayot, St. Lawrence, with twelve comfortable rooms. The garden occupies an area of one hundred acres. He lives a peaceful and leisurely life here, spending his time writing. He does not smoke or eat meat. He eats breakfast at nine o'clock every morning and reads newspapers—from the conservative "London Times" to the communist "Daily Worker." Then he hides in his work hut and writes until one o'clock. He takes a nap after lunch; around four o'clock, he returns to the hut. He stays there until seven o'clock for dinner. In the evening, he reads books and listens to the radio, and goes to sleep at eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>His wife, Charlotte Payne-Townshend, passed away three years ago. Now he lives alone in Ayot, hiring a driver, gardener, housekeeper, and maid. Every July, he must go to London to live for a while, so that the servants can have a rest, and the chimneys, etc., can be cleaned once.</p>
<h3>Congratulatory Message on Shaw's Birthday</h3>
<p>— Written by Professor Murray, Translated by Lan Ning</p>
<p>I am sick, but I cannot leave out GBS, whom I admire so much, from the group of commemorators.</p>
<p>Let me repeat an old inscription. In my book on Aristophanes, I wrote: "Dedicated to my old friend GBS, a lover of ideals, a hater of cruelty, a man who has filled the world with laughter, and whose courage never disappears—"</p>
<p>"A lover of ideals," although I have been with many cultural workers, I doubt that there are few who live such a strong spiritual life and rarely care about the physical aspects like him. He takes the enjoyment of food surprisingly lightly. Vulgarity and carnality are not found in his overflowing wit. Even trauma does not seem to disturb him much. Once, he was seriously injured, bandaged all over, with broken bones, and bleeding a lot. I went to see him, always thinking he was lying in bed, but he told me he was on a high ground in the garden. I went in and didn't see anyone, but I could clearly hear bursts of laughter coming from behind a clump of holly trees. Following the sound, I found him. He did not notice my arrival, did not notice his own trauma, and was writing with his unbandaged hand, laughing happily out loud.</p>
<p>Even as a reformer, what interests him is also ideals. Although he faces and understands worldly affairs, I think his excitement is mainly not for sympathy for human suffering, but more for the absurdity and facilities that cause these sufferings. He reforms with ridicule and cold logic, rather than appealing to emotions.</p>
<p>Of course, one cannot forget his extreme "hatred of cruelty," hatred of cruelty to both humans and animals. He does not seem to belong to our meat-eating race. This race's main pleasure in life is what we call "sports," that is, "hunting," "shooting," and "fishing," often inflicting death and trauma on almost every living and sentient creature. Similarly, he hates the oppression of human nature; it is not that he particularly likes foxes in cities or poor people. It is just that he cannot bear to see them being treated harshly.</p>
<p>Praising him for "filling the world with laughter" is too easy to understand, but two points are worth noting. First, I doubt that there has ever been a greater intellectual and satirist in human history who never attacked or disliked private individuals. He would vehemently criticize behavior or facilities that he thought were cruel or unfair. However, it never involved private individuals. Like general second-rate satirists, or even great predecessors such as Voltaire and Aristophanes, he never thought of hurting others as they did. However, like these two, he has a great asset that many satirists lack: he has genuine respect and appreciation for masterpieces of poetry, painting, music, and drama. Among contemporary scholars, few have a deeper knowledge of Shakespeare studies than him. He always pays attention to contemporary geniuses (not envy or jealousy); he was delighted for Tolstoy, Ibsen, Maeterlinck, and Rodin. He tirelessly helps young British writers.</p>
<p>His "courage never disappears." I am not just referring to his fearless attack on all vested beliefs or facilities with privilege and authority. He attacked conservatism and excessive rhetoric, superstition and science, as long as he thought one of them was overbearing, he would attack it regardless of everything. He also has a rare asset: the courage of genius, or I might even call it the stubbornness of genius. I still remember when his first play was published, everyone thought it could not be put on stage. Theater managers said that he had a bit of dramatic talent; as long as he could change his obscure script, or find a writer with agile thinking who knew the situation of the theater to help him rewrite it, they might be quite worth performing. But twenty years later, he finally resolutely wrote a script that someone dared to perform—"Arms and the Man." It was immediately successful, and not long after, Shaw gained his current position and became Europe's most famous and widely read playwright.</p>
<p>In addition to all his amazing talents, he is one of the most kind and generous people. I will not call him the smartest person; his genius in practice is not constructive, but analytical. Once, in the "Saturday Review," he defended several of his own works and boldly wrote: "Who am I to be fair and impartial?" This is a frank defense. Assessing the factors in the dispute, carefully synthesizing and pointing out a proper path, this is not his job. Officials and rulers can do these. Shaw's job is to point out those things that are wrong but not known; sometimes even at the expense of exaggerated or biased writing, so that people face those things that they cannot see or do not want to see.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 70</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>I never knew what it meant to be busy or tired, but in our Tongxian Temporary Action Headquarters office, to say nothing else, just looking at the staff coming in and out, reporting, commanding, dispatching; and listening to the ding-a-ling-ling sound of the telephone, and the faint, secret buzzing sound of the telegram machine coming from the next room, constantly ringing, the captain, holding the earphones in one hand, receiving telegrams in the other, issuing orders, and reading reports; all of this, etc., even if you just sat there and didn't interfere, just listened and watched, you would feel dizzy, confused, and your eyes and ears would be buzzing.</p>
<p>The head from Beiping is now in the Twelfth Regiment, and has taken the post of temporary chief of staff, in reality to monitor the puppet autonomous army, fearing that it will take excessive action. On the one hand, I am assisting the captain in the office, and on the other hand, I am still working with Tiger to carry out the external liaison work after the launch. This responsibility sounds easy and ordinary, but as long as you close your eyes and imagine, at that time, inside and outside the city, soldiers and horses are rushing, guns and cannons are shaking the sky, bullets are flying randomly, people are shouting, the entire city will turn into a pot of boiling water splashing everywhere, and you have to go back and forth in this chaotic boiling to manage the progress of all parties, receive and send reports, and make decisions; one wrong move, and you may even have to pull out a gun to fight. Thinking about it like this, our job is not very easy.</p>
<p>Tiger, like me, is wearing the "Security Team" uniform, the only difference is that he has a bald monk's head, while I still have a men's haircut. At this time, he was idly doing nothing in the office, dozing with one eye closed, the one eye he opened was probably to pay attention, fearing that he would be left behind when we went out. Because the captain often teased him, saying that he was too young, and when he started working, he was afraid that he would not be able to suppress people. Behind his back, however, he praised him as omnipotent.</p>
<p>When things are busy, time passes quickly, and in a flash it is more than three o'clock. The captain saw that everyone was a little sleepy, so he called the service staff, ordered a few bottles of wine, and took out some ready-made canned food, biscuits, and pastries, etc., to wake everyone up, and at the same time let everyone "have a drink" to celebrate the victory and success in advance. The first one to be alarmed was Tiger, and the one eye that was closed immediately opened.</p>
<p>There is also one thing about Tiger that should be reported here. Tiger has been much more silent since he came to Tongxian than before. In the past, he didn't often interject and speak in front of a large crowd, unless he felt that this sentence had to be said, then he would open his mouth; but when he was alone with me, he wasn't very silent either, and he was very trivial, somewhat like an old woman's nagging. These two days, however, he has changed a bit, even when he is with me, he doesn't speak; doesn't ask, doesn't answer; as if he has something big on his mind.</p>
<p>Yesterday was especially special. Early in the morning, he asked me for a hundred yuan, saying that he had met someone from near the village who was going home, and he wanted to ask that person to donate some money to his mother. This amount is quite large (in the past, the limit was one yuan for money, for haircuts, baths, and buying snacks); not to mention this, and at that time I proved that he was lying, because when he lies, his big round eyes will blink at least three or four times, this is foolproof. It wasn't that I couldn't immediately expose his bubble, but I was curious for a moment and wanted to see what he was up to.</p>
<p>He took the money, and immediately smiled, chatting about everything, forcing out some words to make me laugh; and asked me for two hours of leave (because in official matters, he is my assistant, and considered my subordinate, and he must ask me for leave to go out). I simply agreed very readily, only instructing him to go quickly and return quickly, and not to delay official business. I originally planned to secretly follow his line to see where he was going, but unfortunately, the captain found me to talk, and I didn't have time for a while, so Tiger slipped away. He did come back in less than two hours, and I was too lazy to ask further; because asking would be useless, knowing that he had already prepared a set of words to deal with me; then why bother?</p>
<p>These two days have been so busy, but I have always paid attention to his actions. In addition to being overly silent, he is also constantly blinking, as if he is thinking about something. Even at this time, in the office, although he is said to be sitting on a soft chair in the corner, resting with one eye closed, I don't think he is necessarily fast asleep, he must be planning something there.</p>

<p>Two things called "Happiness" that are not happy now.</p>
<p>One is the dispute between the comedian Xiao Kuaihuo and Senator Lu Keming, which makes everyone unhappy; the other is the lawsuit between the "Kuaihuo Lin" weekly and the two railway directors Chen Bozhuang, which has not yet yielded results.</p>
<p>Mayor's Cleverness</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's driver ignored the red light, and the police first stopped him and then let him go, but the mayor sent his secretary to the police station to order his own punishment for violating traffic rules. A mainland newspaper commented:</p>
<p>"Sometimes, Mayor Wu Guozhen uses extremely subtle methods to express his thoughts..."</p>
<p>I think the mayor didn't do it thoroughly enough. In addition to ordering his own punishment for violating traffic rules, he should also punish the traffic police who were biased in stopping him and then letting him go.</p>
<p>Injections</p>
<p>Traveling requires injections, otherwise you can't buy a boat ticket. Below is a survey form:</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Fujian: cholera, smallpox, plague;</p>
<p>To Tianjin: cholera, smallpox, typhoid;</p>
<p>To Ningbo and Hankou: cholera;</p>
<p>To Taiwan: smallpox, plague, typhoid;</p>
<p>To Guangdong: smallpox, plague;</p>
<p>In short, you have to get an injection for every step you take. I am an amateur, are these injections to prevent infectious diseases in the places you go? Or are you afraid that people will bring infectious diseases from Shanghai to those places?</p>
<h3>The Way to Wealth</h3>
<p>— S·S</p>
<p>Human Relationships and Worldly Wisdom</p>
<p>I don't know if God and humans are deliberately joking? Or is it to add many thrilling and bizarre patterns to this vast world? So, since the beginning of history, there have always been more poor people than rich people in any place; it is not surprising that there are more poor people, but the wonderful thing is that there are also a few rich and noble people dotted among them, so that the turbulent world, the poor people have a goal in life, a goal of climbing up; they climb all day, year after year, until they can't climb and lie down. Seeing the bustling crowds, the dust迷in the middle of the road, climbing up and falling down, falling down and climbing up again, pleasing to the eye, it's really beautiful!</p>
<p>After thousands of years of climbing, the poor have gradually gained some experience and insights. They have learned the climbing method that doubles their efforts. If you do this for a long time, you can take a breath, stretch your waist, wash away the mud, and be a proud person. You must not think of the humbleness and pity in front of other people's feet when you climb, you should remember that this climbing method is a dogma painstakingly left by generations of ancestors, and descendants must克紹箕表, promote and glorify it.</p>
<p>Poor people all have a sour smell on their bodies, which is the biggest obstacle when climbing in front of wealthy people; so you should have self-knowledge, despite the blue robe于装, you must look cheerful and welcoming, your conversation must be gentle and flattering, and yet not fall into clichés; for example, if you know that the master you are welcoming and flattering is a surviving Qing elder, a local gentry, then you should scold science and slander people's hearts while holding the water pipe and agreeing with his intentions, but you cannot over-deny science and people's hearts, because the old masters are very clear that this time the Japanese were indeed defeated by the atomic bomb; if your master is a person who believes that ancestors all immigrated from Europe or America, then you should boast about how magnificent the Alps are compared to the several earthen mounds in Northwest China, emphasizing how magnificent the Mississippi River is compared to the several mud ditches in Southeast China; in the midst of your conversation, if the master's son and daughter "John" and "Little Mary" are eating with rationed food boxes, this is another wonderful opportunity; you can start by praising how much foreign countries value and reasonably emphasize national nutrition, and then analyze the ignorance, poverty, and poverty we showed in this war, and finally draw the conclusion to depict the luxurious scene of people throwing surplus materials into the sea; you are barking and making gestures, shrugging your shoulders, and the masters must also shake their heads, smile and say nothing, and then, when he thinks for a while, pats you on the shoulder and says: "Brother, you are really understanding!" You must not panic, bow your head and listen, expressing that you have met Bole, and that you will die without regret, and are willing to listen to orders, or結草啣環!</p>
<p>And so on, if you happen to encounter a master who used to be a traitor, and is still sitting high above one person and millions of people in a certain place, you must not tell him: the news that a certain close friend who used to be in the same temple as him has been 明正典刑; if you have a master who started his fortune with "national crisis money," "victory money," and "receiving money," and escaped the Qing Dynasty by being good at dancing with long sleeves, you have to explain to him: 儻来之财,原是取之无伤廉惠的道理; if you encounter a master who has just climbed up not long ago, like you, you should express your understanding of his "climbing method" and kneel down, declaring "I was born with a cheap face and cannot reach the top," complimenting him for being able to扶披後進, truly a senior style, a kind-hearted intention; you have to follow their heels slowly and steadily, pat them gently and heavily in the处, then: the masters will regard you as a life-and-death friend, the 同华们 will treat you as a slave and dog talent, and a group below who are also following you and patting your ass will regard you as a "lifetime model," then you can be considered to have climbed a level.</p>
<p>After you have climbed up, although it is still far from the standard of great wealth, you may as well take a short rest and relax your 神抓 that has been climbing so exhausted; at this time, you can brag to the younger generation who are following your heels and climbing up, as well as to the friends who are struggling in the "climbing ranks"; to the former, you must put on a serious and solemn appearance to explain to them the精与与深微 of the "philosophy of climbing," and to the latter, you should宣掦 the logic of "Hu Shi is my friend," especially to introduce your past masters, explaining that these are all relatives, old friends,乡椊同年; they feel that your loud remarks are aggressive, but there is nothing they can do, and they still have to express that I am not as good as you, and respect you very much; in this way, you can gradually leave the circle of poverty. However, you still have to pay attention to the timing, looking for a richer master to獻往日身手,迎拍如儀,拍好就爬,爬上去再吹,吹得四面八方,翕然景從, and as a result, climb to the "celebrity" throne, you may as well steal some free time in your busy schedule and shout a few high-profile "wealth is like floating clouds to me," and hum a few low-profile "feeling the times and cherishing blessings," guaranteed to be sung in harmony by hundreds and leave a lasting fragrance for thousands of years!</p>
<p>The philosophy of "climbing" is like this, and I am willing to make it public. The vast world, the sea of suffering is boundless, there are too many poor people, turning back is the shore, willing to climb together and ascend to bliss together! Amitabha.</p>
<h3>Fine Words</h3>
<p>— Hong Guo</p>
<p>There are two kinds of property that must not be wasted at will; one is the body, and the other is time. The increase of knowledge and the success of the enterprise are all related to this!</p>
<p>Intelligence is a kind of thing that is often mixed with laziness.</p>
<p>Love and borrowing are two difficult problems in life (but as long as it is not abused, then have the courage to do it).</p>
<p>To be a strong person, not a weak person; the so-called strong is to be strong in being able to manage oneself, control oneself, and dominate oneself. And know; putting a maxim into practice is stronger than saying a hundred maxims.</p>
<h3>Quasi-Foreigner</h3>
<p>— Bi Jun</p>
<p>In a certain church university in Shanghai, among the more than nine hundred students, nine-tenths are Chinese, and one-tenth are foreign students. Among the nine-tenths of Chinese students, however, there are a few who speak foreign languages fluently, wear foreign clothes, and have foreign names, thus they are equivalent to Chinese people with foreign appearances. This kind of student, they are definitely not satisfied with being Chinese, but they claim to be Chinese!</p>
<p>Although Chinese people may not all know Chinese characters, in any case, Chinese people must be able to speak Chinese (unless they are mute). Especially in China's highest institutions of learning, it is truly shameful to find students who do not know their own national language. This group of Chinese students who cannot speak their own language are simply shameless. Originally, there was a "Chinese" course for freshmen in the school, but they, like the true foreign students, were exempted from taking it. Indeed, there is not much difference between them and foreigners; they speak foreign languages, look like foreigners, and some even have birth certificates from Madagascar, Codo... They were born in a foreign environment, speak foreign languages, are protected by foreigners, and the schools they attend are also controlled by foreigners. In school, they receive different treatment from Chinese students. If you happen to talk to them for a while, they will unabashedly tell you in a foreign language: "I am also Chinese."</p>
<p>They receive preferential treatment at school because the principals of the school are foreigners. They don't have to pay tuition, and they can eat without spending money. The expenses of these students with unclear nationalities are entirely made up for by the tuition fees of Chinese students. The fists of these semi-foreigners when they are excited are also received by Chinese students. They clearly look down on Chinese people, but they often express in words that they are Chinese!</p>
<p>Seeing that overseas Chinese schools are prohibited from teaching Chinese by the authorities, and that overseas Chinese are indignantly appealing, and seeing the slave nature of these "quasi-foreigners," it really makes me want to cry without tears and laugh without being amused!</p>

<h3>King of Turtles</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a profession is high or low, large or small, as long as it is managed properly, "every trade produces its master." There are two brothers in New York's Broadway—Al Gold and Stanton Gold—who have become rich by selling painted turtles, which can be said to be "masters" outside of the three hundred and sixty trades.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, the Gold brothers started this novel business. After several years of hard work, the business prospered, and they have become wholesalers of "hard-shelled products." Gift shops and dime stores all over the United States sell these novel little gadgets. In addition to the old store on Broadway, they have also added several branches in midtown Manhattan.</p>
<p>These "hard-shelled products" are turtles painted with various colors, about the size of a pocket watch, with an average price of forty-five cents each. Customers can choose a name or a few words to engrave on the turtle's back with indelible ink. Some people engrave the name of their girlfriend, some use it as a birthday or wedding gift, some use it for advertising or display, and some even use it for proposing marriage.</p>
<p>Hollywood star Bing Crosby ordered a batch of "hard-shelled products" for his four children. Shirley Temple, Deanna Durbin, and other Hollywood stars are all fond of this little gadget, and even the serious Charlie Chaplin could not "avoid the trend." Former British Prime Minister Chamberlain once ordered fifty turtles by mail and gave them to his grandchildren. The package for the turtles is a specially made box with ventilation holes, lined with damp moss.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to buy this slow-moving animal. Parents often buy two larger turtles to bring home and paint for their children. A week later, they buy a smaller one, and when the children are asleep at night, they put the small turtle with its "parents." The next morning, the children discover this "miracle" and shout with joy, saying that the little turtle was brought by "cranes."</p>
<p>Some people believe that turtles can bring good luck, so they buy one for "good luck." There are also some people who are too lazy to reply to letters and feel bad about it, so they send a turtle with the inscription: "My reply is as slow as this guy."</p>
<p>The Gold brothers' most sincere customer was a father with two children. He bought three turtles and made a fortune. He had the names of his two children engraved on two turtles respectively, and the name of his family's good friend Nana engraved on the other. Later, Nana visited his house and saw her "namesake." She was moved by the gesture of friendship and took out a sum of money to establish an education fund for the two children.</p>
<p>The Gold brothers have turtle farms in two towns in Louisiana. About 15,000 turtles are shipped to New York every week, all arranged in rows in boxes filled with moss, most of which come from Louisiana. After arriving in New York, the turtles are placed in large buckets, waiting to be "manufactured." The first step is to apply a layer of protective white paint on the turtle's shell. Then, the little things are picked up by the dozen with a yardstick, and a skilled female worker brushes them with a brush, and then puts them on a rack to dry. The next step is to apply a thick layer of enamel—red, yellow, and blue are the three most popular colors.</p>
<p>If the turtle is large, it is suitable for birthdays or weddings. After the turtle is selected, appropriate patterns are painted on its back with special pigments. The "finished" turtles are displayed in buckets partially filled with water—the water in the buckets is warm in winter to prevent hibernation, and cool in summer to "relieve the heat."</p>
<p>The Gold brothers sell a special turtle food containing dried ant eggs and dried flies, the former from Finland and the latter from Mexico.</p>
<p>The Gold brothers also sell another novel thing: small American alligators. However, the "King of Turtles" complained that alligators are not very docile, nor are they easy to obtain year-round, and they do not have much attractive magic. Therefore, from a business standpoint, the Gold brothers still prefer turtles.</p>

<h3>National Treasure, White-Haired Youth - The Humorous Mr. Wu Zhihui (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Jifeng</p>
<p>Everyone is familiar with this aloof and humorous Mr. Wu Zhihui. When senior government officials took office, he was a veteran supervisor, always giving a speech, with a few witty remarks interspersed in the solemnity. On the 15th of this month, Mr. Fang Zhi, the new chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, was sworn in, and the officiating officer was none other than the 81-year-old Mr. Wu. Recently, Mr. Wu also presided over the Mandarin Promotion Committee in Shanghai. (See this newspaper on the 16th.)</p>
<p>Morality and Scholarship</p>
<p>Mr. Wu is a veteran of the Kuomintang, with morality and scholarship crowning his contemporaries. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek respects him as a "national treasure," Feng Yuxiang once called him a "white-haired youth," and Hu Shih praised him as "one of the great thinkers of the past three hundred years." He is extremely aloof, striving to restrain himself. Throughout his life, he has taken not being an official, not riding in rickshaws, and not using servants as his principles. When he was in Chongqing, he often wore old cloth clothes, carrying a cane, and walked to and fro on the road. The "anti-war house" where he lived had thin tiles and a bamboo frame. It was probably built with bamboo and mud. The furnishings were very simple, and the room could only accommodate a few people.</p>
<p>Name Changed to Jingheng</p>
<p>Mr. Wu was originally from Xueyanqiao, Wujin. When he was young, he went to Yanghu County (under Changzhou Prefecture) to take the children's examination. Because his accent sounded like a Wuxi person, the other candidates suspected that he was impersonating and beat him up. Therefore, Mr. Wu hated it extremely and identified himself as a Wuxi person for the rest of his life. In the seventeenth year of Guangxu, he passed the provincial examination. However, he was extremely opposed to feudal ideas. Once, when the Wu clan was compiling its genealogy, he did not approve of it and angrily overturned all the character plates, which caused great hatred from the clan leader and public relations. He had no choice but to escape from his hometown. In the twenty-fourth year of Guangxu, he served as the president of Nanyang Public School in Shanghai. Together with Yuan He Chen Xiaozhi, he agreed not to read thread-bound books again. He also believed that "lacking reverence and knowledge is not enough to bear the weight of the world," so he changed his name to Jingheng.</p>
<p>In the tenth year of the Republic of China, he served as the vice president of the Sino-French University in Lyon, leading a group of students abroad. One day, Mr. Wu found a pair of pants on the ship. He personally washed them clean and then issued a notice: "A pair of stinky pants was found on the ground and has been washed clean. Whose are they? Please claim them." Sometimes, when students threw melon seeds and nutshells everywhere, Mr. Wu also personally held a broom and swept them clean.</p>
<p>Vowed Not to Be an Official</p>
<p>In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, he served as a central supervisory committee member and has been re-elected ever since. As a founding elder of the country, he is already the most veteran of the veterans. Also, because he vowed not to be an official, he does not hold any positions other than supervisory committee member, and he does not easily attend unless it is an important meeting. Therefore, he has also earned the title of "reclusive celebrity in the court." (To be continued)</p>
