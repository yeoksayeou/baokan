<h3>如何挽救工業界之危機？</h3>
<p>— 潘土浩</p>
<p>抗戰八年，雖獲勝利，而國計匱乏，民生凋弊。此正全國人士所應含辛茹苦，努力生產，節約消費，以培植元氣之時也。我國號稱以農立國，然而糧食燃料，尙須仰給外來，衣着原料之花衣，西北產區以運輸不良，貨棄於地，遂爭購美棉印棉以資補充。其他外洋製品之定購已成一般工商家之利藪。加以工潮澎湃，成本太高，不能與外貨競爭，於是廠家紛紛縮小範圍，寗使資金成爲遊資，或爲洋貨之販賣，以求苟全。循此而進，非至全部工業，重蹈其後方之覆轍不止。心所謂危，不敢緘默，爰抒拙見如次：</p>
<p>（一）調整國際貿易政策。　在國際貿易史上，有所謂重商主義者，務以增加出口，减少進口，以謀國家財富之增厚爲目的。故又名重金主義。其主張雖不免稍偏，然亦不乏一部分之眞理。今之所謂先進國家及富有國家，其表面上雖早已放棄此種政策，而實質上仍遵行勿替。在關稅史上有所謂保護主義者，凡國內工業尙未足與國外競爭時，其於有關製成品之輸入，無不多設壁壘，以爲自衛。世界第二次大戰終了，國際貨幣協定成立，各國雖以普遍撤除此種壁壘相標榜，而內中勾心鬥角，並未甘自撤其藩籬。其號稱有計劃而能統制之國，允未甘門戶開放。蓋今之世界，猶以國家爲單位，自無不以本國之利益爲前提。以我國經濟之貧乏，工業之落後，關稅壁壘，宜爲最後之生命綫。且國計民生，凋零已極，凡人生日用之品，又安可一味仰給國外而不求自給？至於奢侈娛樂之貨，皆應寓禁於征，尤爲人同此心。然自外匯正式掛牌以來，雖定有若干辦法，以限制一部份非必需品之進口，而就大體而言，國際貿易仍屬開放政策！姑不論外匯基金來自借貸，不足以塡無窮之漏巵，而民間工業，脆弱已極，又何能坐受摧殘，不加保障？是故國際貿易政策，必須加以調整，此爲刻不容緩之圖。我國工業界向來有一口號曰「提倡國貨」此語已成俗套，似乎不够興奮。然吾人試思今之生產事業，視十年二十年前爲何如？今之國計民生，視前之提倡國貨時期又爲何如？故對症發藥，此提倡國貨一語，在今日宜更是要着。</p>
<p>（二）修正課稅制度生產事業之課稅，應較一般事業爲輕，而尤以有益於民生者爲甚。其須培養實力，以與洋貨競爭者，並應特別改善其納稅辦法，以减低其成本。此在各國之租稅史上，不乏先例。當此戰事初了，財政困難，國家强化稅收，自非得已。然除充實國庫而外，要須顧全納稅人之負擔能力。今之所得稅·利得稅·營業稅·印花稅等，尙須設法改善，以紓民力。數年以來，工業界明盈暗虧，除極少數外，無不在勉强掙扎之中。徒以通貨膨脹，帳面上不無紙上富貴，豈可即眞視爲負擔能力之增高？此即利得稅之所以必須切實减免也。營業稅原爲行爲稅，其行爲之有益於國計民生者，方扶持保護之不暇，更何忍普遍課以重稅，以挫其生機？當營業稅未改爲中央稅以前，各省徵收營業稅大綱及其補充辦法，對於製造事業之課稅，原較一般販賣業爲輕。今之建設計劃，號稱以工業爲先，而營業稅對工業反見加重，實與經濟建設之原意不符。至印花稅本爲憑證稅，非但批發額之貼花應較零售額者爲低，其買賣雙方不需要憑證者，似更不必以收入之故，强商家以必須立證。今獨資工商事業之並無出資憑證者，稅吏亦必須指明照帳面金額貼足印花於資本科目之旁，此種奇突措施，允非立法之本意！夫以新公司之外國公司章，終於將「在本國設立登記營業」一語加以刪改，此後洋商資本主義之壓迫，勢將日重，而外國公司於所利得稅之負擔反較輕。國人生產事業之納稅，究竟應吾體恤，應吾減免，吾人斷不能默爾而息。</p>
<p>（三）考慮勞賃標準　經濟學者言及生產，必舉資本勞力爲二大要素。今人皆以勞資協調爲口頭禪，蓋必須勞資並顧，而後生產事業方可發揚。故勞工之生活及福利，資方自須顧全，而資方之利潤與負擔，勞方亦不應漠視。時彥於產業經濟，皆盛稱美國，要知美國每逢勞賃增加，其生產指數及出品售價，亦必有相當之提升。必如是，乃可謂眞正之協調。若在洋商資本主義壓迫之下，幼稚工業，岌岌不可終日，且效率日低，產量日减，而徒片面提高工資，增加底薪，此祇可謂爲「單調」耳，何嘗有「協調」之可言？今抗戰雖已勝利，而民生仍在十分困苦之中，任何階級皆應適可而止，不可求過分之亨受。試觀今之美國，其一般勞賃，尙在美金，一左右，人民消費，亦尙受普遍之限制，蓋可以深長思矣。</p>
<p>上列三端，明知實行匪易，然欲挽救工業界空前之危機，要不可不同德一心，以共渡此難關。竊嘗聞諸進出口業，美國之主持對華貿易者，曾警吿其出口商，謂中國購買力薄弱可虞，並稱中國出口品，除黃狼皮等少數土產外，美國銷路難見起色，尤以絲茶爲甚。輸出入貿易之不平衡如此，我人雖不自覺，而他人已先爲我躭憂，其可慮爲何如？又聞之紡織業言，日敵國內之紡織設備，盟邦正擬借給花衣，以督導其復工，俾得以製成品供外銷。我國或猶以爲大戰以後，遠東工業惟我獨尊，何其不思之甚耶？</p>

<h3>戴笠將軍的風格</h3>
<p>— 五日南京航訊　久榮寄</p>
<p>軍事委員會調査統計局局長戴笠將軍於三月十七日乘　　　難後，不獨委座聞之悲落悼漢，凡其生前友好，也無不傷　萬汾，記者　就追　所及，撰成本文，以賽復者，藉表哀思。</p>
<p>幼年就學　帶着餅糕充飢</p>
<p>戴將軍家境異常淸寒。幼年求学時期，因爲學校離家很遠，每天朝出暮歸，中午時拿母親給他帶去的餅糕來充飢。及至考入軍校，他從未享受過一般孩子們應有的快樂和幸福，因爲父親早死，所以他完全在偉大的母愛下滋養成長，因此岳母刺字的故事，對他是有着很深的印象和體味的。</p>
<p>矮胖的個子，粗黑的皮膚，那深湛的目光，無論在講演或對部屬訓話時，令人感到一種不可思議的崇敬和威嚴，尤其那宏亮的聲音，和生動的語調，充沛着無限的活力。</p>
<p>九一八後　军统局产生了</p>
<p>九一八事變以後，爲抵禦外侮，軍統局乃應時產生。當時工作重心，一爲制裁敵僞，一爲剷除貪汚和妨礙國家民族利益的人們，因此變成了敵僞的勁敵，和引起貪官汚吏，以及某政黨的反感與仇恨。當時他們的生活異常淸苦，多數部屬穿着藍布長衫，（其時藍布價最廉）至今在民间還傳誦着「藍衣社」的名稱。記得那時一個月的　常費很少，所以買幾個燒餅來充飢，是常有的事，這種儉樸的作風，已經成了戴將軍的習慣。</p>
<p>細心鎭靜　多次遇險脫險</p>
<p>戴將軍每做一事，總是那末週到，細心，和專一，不論在任何動亂的環境裹，仍舊異常鎭靜，吾則，多次通險，很難脫險的。他就是寫個字，摺封信，都是整整齊齊，絲毫不有馬虎。甚至打行李這件小事，也必自己動手。</p>
<p>戴將軍對於部屬所搜集的情報，非常重視，不准有虛構或錯誤。聽說有一位部屬因爲在情報上錯用了一個字，他竟毫不姑息的下令處死。戴將軍尤其痛恨部屬　污。一位負責檢查信件的女郵檢員，因爲貪汚了三百元，亦就地制裁。</p>
<p>生活刻苦　悼亡不再續絃</p>
<p>他們的生活都很困苦，儘管文官接二連三的加薪，他們却依然在物價的高壓下過活。爲了要增加工作效力，並减輕個人負担起見，凡是沒有結婚的男女同志，都不得結婚。戴將軍也同樣沒有續弦。聽說這個禁令隨着抗戰勝利而解除了，但結婚的還是很少，家庭的負担委實太使革命同志可怕。</p>
<p>儼如家長　發揚清白家風</p>
<p>他們的辦公時間，除了白天坐八小時的硬板凳外，晚上還有二小時半。一星期內祗有休假半天，遇到節日或重大紀念日，戴將軍陪着部屬聚餐，部屬視團體如家庭，戴將軍便成了革命家庭裏的家長。繼續光榮歷史，發揚淸白家風，是他們牢不可忘的二句訓示，不論任何人，都有着苦幹苦守任勞任怨的優良德性。</p>
<p>一年一度　公祭死難同志</p>
<p>十餘萬工作同志，在戴將軍領導下工作，不幸爲敵偽殺害的就有數千人。每年七月七日，他們就要舉行紀念大會和公祭，凡是死難同志眷屬都會來祭奠，在祭堂裏有的父母抱着子女的遺像痛哭，有的子女流着淚痛唸着父母死難的日期和死難前的悲壯事蹟，戴將軍總是拿「要有孺子可敎的態度，後生可畏的精神」來勉慰死難的遺族。今年的×月×日，部屬們不知將如何痛悼地下工作的領導者——戴將軍呢！</p>
<p>遺族眷屬　一概予以優待</p>
<p>凡是死難同志的眷屬，都可介紹到生產合作社工作，這族子弟可免費進該局所辦的小學去讀書，學校裏的老師們輪流帶領着上課，吃飯，睡覺，因爲這樣優待死難同志的眷屬，所以派往淪陷區工作，無不視死如歸。</p>
<p>為了捕奸　親飛北平多次</p>
<p>勝利的消息傳來後，爲了交通一時不能恢復，國軍無法東下，收復區顯得異常紊亂。要不是戴將軍命令地下工作人員利用策反僞軍的力量，來維持地方治安，這時的收復區，恐怕更難上軌道了。</p>
<p>爲了逮捕漢奸，戴將軍親自飛往北平多次，務使大小漢奸落網。的確，這至少可以給善良的老百姓出了了口悶氣。</p>
<p>苦鬥一生　家境依然清貧</p>
<p>他從沒有接見新聞記者，也很少參加過公開的集會，他絲毫沒有升官發財的意念，所以苦鬥十餘年，至今家境依然淸寒。他，確是一個最建全的革命者，所以他的死，不但委座和他的部屬要傷心落淚，就是記者也為多難的祖國傳來驚人的惡耗而哭泣了！</p>
<h3>黃河之水天上來　治黃工程定六月底完成　開封鄭州間動員工人達十五萬名</h3>
<p>— 四月一日開封通訊　金明寄</p>
<p>人李太白詩？：「黃河之水天上來」。今人謂：黃河者黃禍也，其災害之烈，古今同慨，中外深　，有談虎色變之概。數十年來，水利硏究會曾製表統計（如豫測天時實騐對照表等），至民國卅一年統計完成，綜合其實騐結果，略如下列第一百二十八表：</p>
<p>治水無方　救災乏術</p>
<p>水利硏究會方面楊豫堂氏著有巨帙「治水方略，」渠謂虞舜殛鯀，千秋定讞，夏禹決川，萬古神功，乃我國自宋·元·明·淸以來，無歲無災，皆由談水學者不宗於禹而宗於鯀，竟有始終憑空拘執已見者，蓋不明治水原理而自誤誤人，更不依科學方法澈底檢討而逕行堵塞黃河北流及支流，迨釀成慘災，與情鼎沸，並交相彈劾，方知大錯鑄成，或引咎自退，或自請處分，或事後不再堵塞，收　乏術，於是民衆慘　其殃。</p>
<p>過去若干年來，對於治黃工程之方策均不合實際需要，且亦不合科學原理。據楊豫堂先生稱：共中旣不得利且有後患之主要方策的有八種之多：</p>
<p>（一）堵塞決口，叧於京水鎭設一大閘，但一閘不能容納全河流量，勢必如前潰決，所謂蓄水自溺者是也。</p>
<p>（二）堵塞巨川，　濬支流。</p>
<p>（三）堵塞上游，疏濬下游。</p>
<p>（四）堵塞決口，不頸其他。</p>
<p>（五）堵塞決口，遲開　　。</p>
<p>（六）堵塞決口，不開閘　。</p>
<p>（七）堵塞決口，加修堤防，堅守閘壩。</p>
<p>（八）盡堵支流，蓄水停沙，而反謂來水衝沙。</p>
<p>上列各項方策，若非防川，即係造災，若非舍本逐末，即係遺大投細，決無善良之後果可言。</p>
<p>引黃入衛　改歸故道</p>
<p>現在，治黃問題爲目前復員與建設工作中之主要目標，此次水利硏究會季龍圖氏，堅決主張引黃入衛，復歸故道，其方法係：（一）引黃自武陟·新鄉濱滑間入衛，至天津，出大沽，新港，入海，導淮入海（二）縮小中牟決口，多設溢流堤，早開閘壩。（三）若再誤以淮濟爲黃河故道而堅堵決口，保守閘　，則上旱下水，河南必一荒蕪如故，魯。冀。蘇北。將成澤國。（四）若決口不縮，閘壩不開，則河南有北　南水之象，皖鄂皆成水災之鄕。（五）如決口堵塞不堅，乍堵乍決，則河南一歲數災，而且勢必影響及東南各鄰省。（六）冬春氣候反常，各地水位亦均高漲，一屆夏秋，雪山融解，暴雨時作，西水下注。同時，豫北一帶尤險，蓋地多荒蕪，蝗孽易於滋生所致。</p>
<p>漲訊以前　工程完成</p>
<p>最可喜而値得向國人報道者：治黃工作，顯然已由研究階段而踏入實踐階段。我國水政大計以及十年修堤計劃，已由政府常局審核完竣，在交通部，資源委員會，行政院善後救濟總署，與聯合國善後救濟總署，四個機構精一誠合作之下，治黃工程已開始積極推進。所需原料物資，正由上海運來開封，每日計量一百萬噸，以供治黃工程所需。據參加此項工程計劃之專家云：動員工人，達十五萬人之譜，預定至遲在本年六月間河水高漲時期以前必須完成。聯總此一計劃完成後，當能使前被破壞之我二百萬英畝土地恢復其農業上之全部生產力，而所謂沉疴未治之「黃禍」亦得及時避免矣。</p>
<p>自趙宋堵塞黃河，北流全國以來，千載無法解決水道癥結所在之豫省，所受水旱災異，情况旣格外慘重，次數又特殊衆多，故當此番聯總，行總，交通部，資源委員會合作黃河救治工程喜訊傳來時，此間各界均寄予最熱烈之希望。</p>
<h3>晉展開全面運動　兵農合一</h3>
<p>— 三月廿日太原航訊　剣塵寄</p>
<p>土地問題，爲世界史上之一大問題，迨近世社會主義興起，此一問題，更爲社會政策及社會革命者所重視，國家之安危與世運之　替，動　與土地問題發生密切之關聯。我國在抗戰末期，因兵源與糧食問題之日趨嚴重，而侷促於華北黃河東岸第二戰區轄之晋西，遂因處境之特殊艱苦，而在土地方面，表現了劃時代的革命措置，實施了「兵農合一」，此　已於去歲十一月間奉中央令，准在晋省舉行實騐，蔚爲晋政之中心。</p>
<p>實施緣起</p>
<p>晋民素憚從軍而省境則淪陷最早，第二戰區所恃以爲抗戰根據者，僅晋西之十數最貧瘠山岳縣區，其中完整者只有大寗。永和·隰縣·鄕寗·蒲縣·石樓等六縣，統計全自由區，人口不過二百萬，地方瘠苦，民少惴蓄，壯丁被徵入營後，家無瞻仰，即有乘亂逃亡，亦不敢歸家，馴至南畝荒蕪，兵源告竭，軍民交困，戰局危殆，　長官為欲有以支持抗戰危局，必須做到「打仗人多，種地人多，打仗人好，種地人好」，始能於軍於民之福利，兼籌並顧，遂於三十二年八月十五首腦部舉行之未刪行政會議席上提出以上十六字之口號，即根據之擬定兵農合一方案。係遠師三代「井田」制度及唐代「府兵」之遺意，取其長而去其短。　氏且回認係遵奉　國父遺敎「平均地權」的公平澈底辦法，已可做到「耕者有地種」足當走向「耕者有其田」程途中之尖宿站，而其效用則為「國防問題與土地問題，併爲一談而處理；民族革命與社會革命，熔爲一爐而解決。」兵農合一之具體實施，大別之爲編組·份地·均糧三大步驟。</p>
<p>編組份地</p>
<p>編組份地，係遵照兵役法，凡十八歲至四十七歲之男子，均爲役齡壯丁，各以居村爲單位，每三個役齡壯丁，編爲一兵農互助小組，一人服常備兵役，出征衛國，二人服國民兵役，在家種地，規定每一國民兵，每年須優待常備兵家屬小麥五石，棉花十斤，並酌予柴水及其他費力不費錢之帮助。步兵每屆三年，騎砲二兵每屆四年退伍一次，輪流服役，逾齡則除役，及齡則編組，編組係採自願組合方式，不能合謀者，用抽籖法決定，在逾齡及未及齡之老幼及婦女均可任助耕，領種份地之國民兵，則係主耕。</p>
<p>劃分份地</p>
<p>劃分份地，係參照土地法，土地重劃，以居村（爲一副村轄於治村爲晋省村治之新編制）爲單位，按每份地不超過五塊，好壞搭配，每份地收益，除田賦負担及地租舖墊外，足敷二十石糧食之純收益，以養八口，及足二農民耕作之量爲標準，劃爲一份地。主助耕，則按其勞力大小分配收獲食糧成數，至土地所有權，則仍屬地主，由國民兵按每糧銀一兩，給予地主地租一石小麥，田賦等負担則由國民兵負責。至份地方法，係依劃分份地大綱及實施程序，先之以幹部之四次家家訪問，與民合謀後，召開全村宣傳大會後，由村民選出評議員，三人至五人負執行劃分份地之責，由村幹部督導檢點而完成工作。</p>
<p>平均糧石</p>
<p>平均糧石，係參照土地法，訂定均糧辦法，按土地產量，評定土地等級，使無有糧無地，有地無糧，地好糧輕，地壞糧重，地多糧少，地少糧多等種種負担不公平之積弊，以地租不得超過正產量千分之三百七十五之　定，作為領份地農民一切負担之標準，擬定各等糧石累進標準表，作為均糧尺度，以定各等級地糧額，均糧以居村為單位，使居村原有糧額不增不減，僅使其負担平均合理。</p>
<p>救濟敎育</p>
<p>兵農合　之實行，社會上連帶發生之問題至多，其最重要者為老弱之養，痼疾與無告者之扶持，其救濟辦法，為男子六十五歲以上，女予六十歲以上，編爲救護小組，從事輕微工作，至不能從事生產亦無人贍養渚，則予以救濟食糧，此項救濟經費及食糧，規定由地主應收地租內，按十分之二起，累進徵收之食糧支銷，以言敎育，因社會收入增加，規定六足歲至十七歲十一年之國民必修敎育，十八歲以上，百分之二優良學生，公費升學，使敎育機會均等。</p>
<p>懶漢奪田</p>
<p>國民兵中之懶漢，不努力耕作者，則奪其田，予以乞食證，限期改過，再復其田，其理想在做到，「以工作保障生活，以生活管理行爲，」期社會上無壤人，無閒人，無窮人，無愚人，終於達到廢止刑法之目的，故有兵農合一是「聚寳盆」之稱謂，領種之份地，爲祖輩踢不了的老家產，兵農合一並非只管農而置工商礦於不顧，亦非不分戰時平時，必須一律均服常備兵役，晋省在勝利之前，即另編有兵工小組，兵礦小組，兵運小組，商則因當時廢止私商，凡商皆公，故未編兵商小組，兵則戰時為常備兵，平時，可分為常備兵國民兵及國防工業方面之工人。</p>
<p>推行現況</p>
<p>勝利後，閻氏、曾有重慶之行，主席特派邵力子等與閻氏作詳盡之兵農合一長談，閻氏更向各方作演講介紹，而中央對晋省試辦明令，亦於年前頒到，故今歲　晋省全面展　兵農合　之開始，所　　　，則為由敵偽而易之爲中共，共黨在其　近地區宣傳兵農合一之病民，並繼之以「誰領份地殺誰」之威嚇，此期間之劇烈鬥爭，則必慘　，面晋當局則仍以不屈不撓之精神，如前奮進，一月四日，主辦兵農合一之省府委員薄右丞，率中堅幹部七十二人，赴太原近郊之三給，攝樂，圪撩溝等村實習，於十二日之間，完成工作返時，黨國元老張溥泉先生及合衆社紐約時報李博文等中外記者來　時，均曾親赴已實行之村莊參觀，張老親向老農及國民兵詳詢，李博文等則正　舉行國民兵授領份地典禮，張老於返歸幷市後，大爲揄揚，各記者則必已有各別之記載矣，經首次在收復區實騐之後，隨之則爲在太原市陽曲五台代縣等二十五縣市之推廣，現在正値步入全面開展時期，惟因宿麥已於去歲播種入土，而春麥稻子亦已播種在即，恐誤農時，一面進行編組份地均糧，一面已宣佈「誰種誰收」，使農民均得安心耕種，又因收復區人衆，且抗戰已吿結束，應减輕國民兵負担，增高常備兵優待，已改訂辦法爲六人編爲一兵農互助小組，以一人爲常備兵，每一國民兵供給常備兵家屬三石糧食（小麥小米各半）五斤棉花，所有國民兵，除交優待糧花及帮差糧每兩糧銀糧食一斗外，再無其他名義之負担，國民兵中並有四分之一，爲純國民兵小組，即六人均爲國民兵，每人應交之優待糧花，帮差糧，均劃入縣村經費，如仍不足縣村之用，則以另抽「合理負担」補足之　合理負担之來源，為對非農夫之工商各界人士收益中取得，因已決定工商所運役齡壯丁，暫不編組，而其負担則分為資產生息及職業利潤兩項，即錢生利，課以累進稅率，身生之利，課以累進稅率，惟此僅為初步之擬議，尙未定案，聞詳細章則已在草擬中。（三月廿二日午夜）</p>

<h3>蘇北的恐怖世界</h3>
<p>主筆先生：蘇北現在已經是一個恐怖的世界，尤其是如皐白蒲一帶是更糟，流亡到南通去的人也日日都有。在共軍，此種行動謂之「淸算大鬥爭』，有怨報怨，有仇報仇，鼓勵暗殺，定了特種刑罰，也像山東的炸彈，『拖地雷』，『望中史』等。在抗戰期中，共軍尙未現其原形，公然的綁票，而現在則已改變作風，大綁其票，並不遜於汪逆的僞軍。他們任意誣書忠良，先宣稱家中爲藏有槍校，必須繳出云云，如果回答沒有，他們就任意挖掘，然後他們自己已將自己的子彈拿出說是掘出的，於是你就得罰上幾百，幾千，幾萬……斤的稻籽，沒有，就殺掉你。在政治協商之後，而大做其綁票生涯，殺人生涯，不知政協議案上那一條規定着。蘇北民衆的痛苦向誰去申訴？政府視之漠然，面一部份的學者還在雜誌上歌頌『解放區』的善政，一部份的鄕老如黃炎培先生之流，還在替延安瞎捧塲，不知他們願意來看看蘇北民衆的苦况吾？嗚呼！此次的淸算大鬥爭將要殺去一半的良民，而一般知識靑年也在被殺之列。因爲有了知識份子，對他們的『民主』的推進就有了妨碍。我要代表蘇北被書的人民向貴報呼籲，請貴報轉請政府設法來解除痛苦，別無奢望，只望共軍少殺幾個人。——當然囉他們要殺，有誰能擋？——懇借貴報予以刋皇，則感謝莫名。</p>

<h3>壯遊　次杜少陵五十六</h3>
<p>— 顧一樵</p>
<p>往昔十三四，壯遊始北場，清華秀水木，晨夕意氣揚。文學新革命，涅槃歎鳳凰，池畔詠紅燭，羞澀我詩囊。芝蘭與茉莉，孤鴻訴熱腸，碧　護檀柘，鬱鬱西山蒼。濟濟萃多士，大同東海茫，皎皎中秋月，重陽送遠航。舟行起海嘯，浩刧到扶桑，天地忽震怒，東京一炬荒。劍橋來作客，五月薇薇香，虹飛江上濤，雲月映寒塘。弟兄欣聚首，懷椿淚浪浪，相勵工程業，實學棄詞章。南海巨星殞，海外我　　，大江東去海，舉國咽淒涼。百年鴉片　，馬關恥豈忘，同學多年少，結伴各遷鄉。或者執教鞭，桃李滿門牆，或者參政事，品位立朝堂。通儒兼碩學，著作放言狂，我歸穿歐陸，白山黑水旁。春日江南麗，冬月叩雲岡，踏雪尋青塚，試馬射驚鶴。漠漠長城道，綏遠又新疆，難忘九一八，敵騎入瀋陽。男兒齊解甲，儡傀立廢王，我上雞鳴寺，長白黯無光。太息新華夢，稱帝　冠裳，五四青年起，我亦立昂藏。翩翩張氏子，酣舞醉　觴，高歌寒易水，蕭蕭悲白楊。壯哉一二八，我送兵馬忙，淞滬四十日，軍退民受殃。南雍方教誦。首都遷汴梁，熱河看不保，豈止東北亡。辭京華北去，欲築長城長，燕雲千里淡，烽火南天　。塘沽簽協定，冀察嗟炎黃，青年相對泣，故都撤戎行。我輩言誅伐，野心揭虎狼，國難日嚴重，強鄰日跳梁。元戎憂胥旰，淬厲挽膏肓，航空謀建設，學術探鷹揚。廬山預海會，血淚裹　瘡，一心共一德，異夢覺同床。精誠首團結，明恥莫悲傷，秦誓頭湯幫，周武　少康。厲兵復秣馬，聽命於中央，　　抗戰起，英俊集四方。文武教合一，氣宇始軒昂，請纓為報國，浴血最流芳。八年神聖戰，胡馬飲滄浪，三竿長征返，崑崙耀雲霜。忽傳原子彈，奇蹟更非常，我來觀落日，瀛海直飛翔。</p>
<p>三十五年黃花岡節　東京</p>
<h3>地攤恨</h3>
<p>— 張契渠</p>
<p>勝利的爆竹在山城發出第一個火花的時候，性急的朋友已經把行李收拾起來了。</p>
<p>「回老家了！回老家了！」下江佬情不自禁地喊着。房東再也不提加房租的事，四川人再也不拿「非友誼」的態度對待下江人。誰也知道「留也留不住，馬上都要出川了！」</p>
<p>可是「入川容易出川難」，當初携家帶眷，背着包裹，挑着箱子，一路逃一路丟，逃到重慶，丟得差不多了。及在重慶找到了房子，安下家，四季衣衫不全，桌櫈器皿俱無，要一樣沒一樣，衹好一點點一星星底跟着步步上漲的物價，辛辛苦苦地逐漸添置起來。到現在，總算像蝸牛似的弄成了一份家，而今一旦要將他拱手讓人，別說在經濟的觀上有些捨不得，便在情緒上也像對着一華當共患難的夥計，不忍便棄之如敝履而不顧。然而事實上又絕不可能把那些瓶兒罐兒都搬上輪船飛機，像駱駝似的一股腦兒背到下江去。那怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>辦法終於很快的想出來了！將他有條件的送給四川人，既可以免得像「偽組織」似的帶着累贅，又可以換幾張法幣貼補貼補路費。或者帶些銀耳貝母之類四川土特產回去，送送親戚朋友，免得被他們看出自己在重慶時的寒酸。</p>
<p>在勝利初臨的三天之內，重慶自最熱鬧的精神堡壘四週，最尊嚴的國民政府附近，以至郊外的小龍坎，青木關，北碚，南泉，沿馬路公路，都成了地攤市場。八年來苦夠了的公務員，固然擺得最起勁，賣得最澈底，便是那些賣香煙的小商人，修電燈的勞動朋友，以至大學教授，作家，名流，也莫不盡其所有，將那些愛莫能「携」的洋裝書籍，以及泡菜罐子等等，都拿出來陳列在人行道上，標價出售。</p>
<p>擺地攤，不比買黃金美鈔，發國難財，做投機生意。幹這種事，既無損令名，亦說不上貪利。反之，在地攤旁站着，正可以表示：（一）我在抗戰期間沒有發國難財，可以對得起國家。（二）我沒有貪污，可以對得起同胞。（三）我快回老家，吃魚吃蝦，補償補償八年來的苦日子了。</p>
<p>同樣擺地攤，這和沿馬路叫賣人造絲襪三千元兩雙的走碼頭販子不同。擺地攤，不能列在商人羣中，他不受官應的統制，不為　價所拘束。便是警察也不敢來妄加干預。所以無論坐着站着，總是另一番神氣，決非一般小商人所得而同日語也。</p>
<p>當初，原不過想把那些携帶不了的東西，找一個安頓地方，能換幾個法幣，自然更好。初不敢有藉此發財的妄想。誰知擺地攤的結果，賣得的錢竟比買進時的原價多了好幾倍。每天萬兒八千的收入，着實比一天坐八小時辦公廳有出息得多。晚上回來算帳，對着大把小把鈔票，不覺心花為之大開。早知地攤出息如此好，當初何必去當公務員？</p>
<p>可是好景不常。過不多久，物價回漲，當初值五萬元一件的大衣，賣了二萬五千元已經歡天喜地，如今到馬路上一看，掛在櫥窗里的粗呢大衣，標價都在六七萬以上，不免懊悔自己太性急，賣得太便宜了。因此有些人追踪而上，跟着漲價；有些人却索性收起包裹，暫取觀望態度。結果，漲價者生意清淡，收攤者根本凍結。遲延得遲延，到真有走的希望的時候，衹有特別大拍賣，按舊貨對折三三折脫手。否則惟有奉贈房東，留作紀念了！</p>
<p>將一份家當縮成十五公斤，從重慶搬到上海。這十五公斤之中，當然不能容許鍋碗匙勺在內。可是鍋碗匙勺之類，偏偏與衣食住行一樣不可或缺。於是到了上海衹好另行籌措，從新購置。還得以更廉的價格，購些比「國難出品」高明一點的什物，給自己慰勞一番。誰知上海的物價暴漲，早已不是「天上飛下，地下鑽出」者的黃金時代了。別說大公司不敢問津，便是小舖子也一樣老辣得嚇人。不得已，衹好到虬江路去光顧黃牛攤，尋些日本人「歸國大拍賣」賣出來的舊東西，湊合湊合。因為黃牛攤所售的鍋碗匙勺之類，正是重慶來的既無封條又無金條約朋友，「成家立業」必備的東西。</p>
<p>黃牛攤劃地為市，連綿不絕。其勢和重慶的夫子池一帶地攤市場差不多。不過從前坐在攤後的貨主，現在站在攤前成了顧客了。多情的太太，看到黃牛攤上的茶杯水瓶，不免想起自己在重慶時狠心賣掉的那些東西。四隻玻璃杯，只買了四百元。現在呢？指着攤上那對跟自己賣掉的差不多的杯子，問攤後的黃牛，黃牛把指頭一伸，斬釘截鐵的說：「存心買，一句話，一千六，少一個不成。」</p>
<p>太太埋怨先生，先生埋怨交通。真為交通困難，携帶不便嗎？人家怎麼把螃蟹板鴨送到了重慶，把廣柑榨菜帶來了上海？所謂困難，不過無能者自欺自解而已！即使破銅爛鐵真不便携帶，為什麼不多裝些便於携帶的鈔票黃金回來呢？在重慶，還可以自命清廉，穿着「捉襟見肘」之衣，「腳踏實地」之鞋，表示堅苦。在黃牛攤前，恐怕即使你向他們大聲疾呼表白自己在抗戰期間，如何奮鬥，如何努力，沒有發國難財，也沒有括地皮，也決不會有人送兩隻茶杯，以示慰勞。還不是等於對牛彈琴而已。</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛　（二六）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>「你這沒良心的老狗！你想怎麼樣呀？你！你……」墨太太大聲嚷着。</p>
<p>「爸爸！爸爸！」麗華拉住墨老爺的衣襟求情地哭叫。</p>
<p>墨老爺不理，直鼓盡了平生的勇氣，咬着牙，一個勁兒地打！打！打！</p>
<p>「我要怎麼樣？我要教訓你！我不准你再同翁家女人去看戲！我不准你再在外頭給我丟臉現醜！」墨老爺一邊打，一邊氣咻咻地說。</p>
<p>墨盛和寶鈴都來了。墨盛強拉住了墨老爺。墨太太得着這個機會，便站起來撲過去咬墨老爺的手。寶鈴連忙又把墨太太抱住了。</p>
<p>「少爺，快把太太拉到上房去。」墨盛說。</p>
<p>「不行，我今兒非跟他拼了這條老命不可。」墨太太固執地直往墨老爺面前撞。</p>
<p>「媽，有話明天再講，這會子爸爸還醉着哩!」寶鈴說着，用力把墨太太拖向門外。</p>
<p>「媽！媽！」麗華也哭着往外拉墨太太。</p>
<p>「你們給我滾開！你們這些混賬王八羔子！」墨太太狂怒地啐着孩子們。</p>
<p>「太太！夜靜了，別鬧的叫左鄰右居們笑話。」墨盛急得用乞求的口吻勸說。</p>
<p>但是墨太太的忿怒，怎樣也平息不下來。她瘋狂地跳着；掙扎着；要去還擊她認為是沒有資格虐待她的墨老爺。但被寶鈴拖得她筋疲力盡，她不能自主地只好走出了書房。她委屈地哭了！她放聲嚎啕，並撕破了喉嚨地大罵墨老爺不是人，墨老爺忘恩負義。</p>
<p>墨老爺沒有回罵墨太太一句，也已經沒有力氣再去打她了。這時心裡彷彿鬆弛了許多，但是身子却沉重得站立不住。四肢抖擻成一團，上下顎顫慄得合不攏了，牙齒與牙齒碰得直響。</p>
<p>「老爺，您冷嗎？」墨盛看見這情形關心地問。一面扶墨老爺睡到床上。</p>
<p>「不……不……墨老爺顫聲地說。</p>
<p>「老爺，有什麼事同太太講道理好了，不該動手，這樣更傷感情。瞧您氣成這個樣兒，也糟蹋自己的身子。」墨盛勸慰着墨老爺。他以為墨老爺這會子是氣得發抖。</p>
<p>「她不會同我講道理的，她永遠認為她所作的一切都是對的，她絕不肯聽信我半句話。因此，我才迫不得已動了一次手。我讓她索興恨我一輩子！」墨老爺興奮地說罷，臉上露出雖痛苦而勝利的微笑。</p>

<h3>Tension Increasing in Changchun City; National Army May Quickly Take Over; Communist Army in Harbin Occupies Water Source</h3>
<p>[Our Beijing Dispatch, 11th] The National Army, advancing north along the China Chang Railway from Shenyang, has reached an area two days' march from Changchun. After the Soviet army withdrew from Changchun, officials stated that the National Army may quickly take over, but taking over Harbin would be very difficult because the National Army is very far from Harbin.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 11th] Now, with only three days remaining until the final Soviet withdrawal, the level of tension in the city is increasing every moment. The number of pedestrians on the streets is noticeably decreasing. All shops close their doors after 3 PM, and some large stores have already ceased operations. The sound of gunfire is no longer limited to the night; it can be heard everywhere during the day. However, since the evening of the 3rd, there have been no organized combat operations. The weather on the 10th and 11th has been good, and the airport is still being secured by security forces. Also, the Soviet "epidemic prevention unit" in Fanjiatun and other places south of Changchun has withdrawn to the city on the 10th to carry out work.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Xiaofengman Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Songhua River, which supplies electricity to most of the Northeast, was "taken over" by the Communist army from the Soviet army on the 10th and renamed the Xiaofengman Hydroelectric Power Bureau. So-and-so has been appointed as the director.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The massive building that was formerly the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army has raised our national flag, which is a symbol of great significance. The exterior of the building is a fortress in the shape of a 工 character. The four corners of the roof are upturned, resembling a palace. Most of the roof tiles are dark black. Marshal Malinovsky once established his headquarters here. Before his departure, Dong Yanping informed the Soviet side that it was intended to be used as Chiang Kai-shek's temporary residence in the future.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Harbin Dispatch, 11th] The Communist army in Harbin has occupied a water source within the city and is attempting to occupy the transformer substation and the electric light factory. The area with the most Communist army presence in the city is the Majia District in the southern suburbs and the Wang Zhaotun area, with approximately 5,000 to 6,000 people, because this area is closer to the airport. Also, Communist troops from various counties in Songjiang Province have been moving towards Dehui in recent days, seemingly to strengthen the defense line in Dehui in order to prevent the National Army from advancing north.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang Dispatch, 10th] The government troops advancing north along the Shen-Chang Road to take over were attacked twice by the Communist army on the 7th, suffering slight losses. On the 8th, they advanced to an area approximately 30 kilometers from Siping Street and were again subjected to fierce attacks by the Communist army. It is reported that the Communist army has now concentrated more than one division of troops in the Siping Street area and has laid thousands of landmines in the area in an attempt to prevent the government troops from advancing north. Also, the Communist army has gathered five brigades in the Benxi Lake area and launched a fierce attack on the government troops south of Fushun on the evening of the 7th, which continued until the morning of the 8th.</p>
<h3>Military Trio to Fly to Shenyang Today; Democratic League Invites Representatives from Both Sides to Discuss; Has Proposed Compromise Suggestions on the Northeast Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Beijing Dispatch, 11th] The Military Trio remained in Beijing on the 11th due to business. Representatives from the three sides held an important meeting at 10 AM, which adjourned at noon. After lunch, the three sides held separate meetings. They may fly to Shenyang on the 12th. In addition to Qin Decun and Gillen, Ye Jianying will still be represented by Chen Shiqu because his dental illness has not yet healed. Executive Department members Zheng Jiemin and Robertson, as well as the Communist Chief of Staff Luo Ruiqing (representing Ye Jianying), will also accompany them for inspection, and they are scheduled to return to Beijing on the 14th. It is generally speculated that the three parties have not yet established a concrete plan on the details of resolving the Northeast issue. Officials stated that the Military Trio did not bring new instructions for the mediation work in North China, but may have instructions on the issue of restoring transportation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Beijing Dispatch, 11th] The Military Trio is delaying their departure from Beijing by one day because the American representative, General Gillen, will be meeting with American staff here. Whether they will travel to other areas after arriving in Shenyang will depend on the local situation. They will return to Chongqing on the 14th, and may not land in Beijing on the way back.</p>
<p>[Our News from Chongqing] The delegation of the Democratic League hosted representatives from the government and the Chinese Communist Party yesterday evening to discuss various opinions on the issue of a ceasefire in the Northeast. Apart from increasing the opportunity for exchange and discussion, little progress has been made in the discussion of the issue. (1) Regarding the ceasefire in the Northeast, based on the ceasefire agreement announced on March 27 and the two unannounced supplementary clauses for negotiated takeover, military conflicts should cease. The two sides have different opinions. The government side believes that the takeover of sovereignty in the Northeast must not be obstructed and should be discussed first, followed by a ceasefire. The Communist side believes that the armed takeover of the seven major cities after March 27 without negotiation was a violation of the ceasefire agreement and that a ceasefire should be implemented first, followed by negotiations on a peaceful takeover. The Democratic League immediately proposed a compromise solution: both sides should immediately order a five-day ceasefire and negotiate to resolve various issues during the ceasefire period in order to peacefully take over sovereignty in the Northeast. (2) The Communist army should withdraw from areas along the Shenyang-Harbin line so that the government army can smoothly enter Changchun. (3) After the government army enters Changchun, the two sides will conduct negotiations to resolve the Northeast issue in accordance with the two major resolutions of military reorganization and the Political Consultative Conference to achieve a comprehensive solution. However, the representative of the government stated that the Northeast issue should still be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. At this point, the participants turned to discuss the reorganization of the national government, the National Assembly, and the Jiaochangkou Incident before adjourning at 10:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Southern Tour; Kunming Prepares to Welcome</h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 11th] It is widely rumored here that Chairman Chiang will come to Kunming from Guiyang to inspect and express his condolences to the people of Yunnan. He will also give instructions to local leaders from all walks of life. The 300,000 people of the city are very excited about this rumor. The Yunnan Provincial Assembly is currently in session, and the speaker of the Assembly, Gong Zizhi, proposed to the Assembly this morning that after Chairman Chiang arrives in Kunming, the Assembly should invite the Chairman to give instructions to all provincial assembly members. The Assembly should also draft a plan to reform the province and submit it to Chairman Chiang for approval. In addition, the Speaker and Vice-Speaker will pay a visit to His Excellency to present the situation of Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>[United Press International Dispatch, 11th] Chairman Chiang is currently touring southern China and is expected to return to the capital in the near future to receive the French goodwill delegation, which is scheduled to arrive on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Dispatch, 10th] When Chairman Chiang met with Von, the Far East Manager of the Associated Press, in Chongqing, he predicted that China's new coalition government could be formed within a few weeks. Informed sources believe that General Marshall will return to China in the coming days, which is a symbol of hope for China's unity. This afternoon, all newspapers prominently published the news of Von's audience with Chairman Chiang. However, some members of Congress have expressed their intention to remain cautious about this matter until the situation becomes clearer. It is believed here that this is a general optimistic tone of Chairman Chiang's remarks.</p>

<h3>Jinan-Dezhou Highway Extended; Connects with Tianjin-Puzhen Train</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 10th] The highway from Jinan to Dezhou is open. The Tianjin-Puzhen section of the Jinpu Northern Railway can now reach Puzhen directly from Tianjin. Currently, the only section of transportation between Tianjin and Jinan that has not been connected is the 160-li section between Puzhen and Dezhou.

<h3>Ministry of Finance to Assist Salt Merchants; Plans to Establish Salt Industry Bank</h3>

<h3>600,000 People in Nanjing; Illiterates Account for Half</h3>

<h3>Plan for Reforming Provincial Organization Drafted</h3>
<p>[United Press International Chongqing Dispatch, 11th] Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke stated today that the Central Design Bureau has drafted a plan to reform the provincial organization, dividing each province into two or more. He expects that the current 28 provinces will increase to around 60. This plan and two other alternative plans will be submitted to the National Assembly for a vote. Currently, many provinces are too large. For example, Sichuan has 45 million people, which makes it difficult to promote administration. There are also several provinces where the Nationalists and Communists each occupy half. This problem may be solved by dividing the provinces. Sun also said that 75% of the work of drafting the new constitution has been completed and will be submitted to the National Assembly next month. If there are no unexpected disputes, the Political Consultative Conference's Comprehensive Group will complete its work in two weeks. There are still two points on the constitution draft that have not been resolved: one is the veto power of the Executive Yuan over the Legislative Yuan, and the other is provincial autonomy. Although military conflicts may prompt the Communists and other parties not to attend the National Assembly, the Comprehensive Group will continue its efforts to resolve the political issues of the national unification plan. If there are no unexpected developments, the National Assembly will open as scheduled on May 5 in the capital.</p>
<h3>MacArthur's Headquarters Orders Japanese Government to Transport Mining Explosives to China</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Education Has Established Temporary Northeastern University Tutorial Class in Shenyang; Taking Over Four Puppet Manchukuo Universities</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 10th] Dong Dianzheng, the person in charge of the Ministry of Education's special commissioner's office here, told reporters that the Ministry of Education has established a temporary Northeastern University Tutorial Class here and has already enrolled several hundred and eight students. In the past, students who had studied at specialized schools or above in the Northeast and had entered the pass were returning to Shenyang. In addition to more than 300 people arriving from Jinzhou, those scattered in Beijing are currently on their way back to Shenyang. The tutorial class only admits students based on their credentials and no longer uses the screening method. The South Manchuria Medical University, Shengjing Medical University, Agricultural University, and Industrial University, which were under the puppet Manchukuo regime in Shenyang, are currently being taken over. The two medical universities are still complete. The Agricultural University has only empty shells of school buildings. The Industrial University has been badly damaged. In the future, South Manchuria Medical University may become an independent college. The other three medical, agricultural, and industrial schools may be merged into Northeastern University. The old site of Northeastern University was used as a Japanese military barracks during the puppet Manchukuo regime and has now been severely damaged. It is estimated that it will cost more than 10 million circulating currency to repair it. In addition to taking over specialized schools and above, the Ministry of Education also plans to take over the libraries and museums here, which are only bare walls, deserted and desolate. The library still has many books.</p>

<h3>Indigenous People in Malaya</h3>
<p>Kill Our Overseas Chinese Compatriots</p>
<p>British Say It's Due to Incitement by Former Japanese Army</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The British Colonial Secretary stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the discord between Chinese and Malays in Malaya led to the assassination of 56 Malays at the Bika Mosque on March 6th, which was caused by the Japanese army inciting animosity during the occupation. There have been conflicts in the past four months, with losses on both sides, especially in the Perak River area, which the Governor-General is closely monitoring. On November 6th last year, 300-400 Malays killed 40 Chinese in the Bira area, mostly women and children.

If measures are not taken to stop this, it will become even more rampant. Many of the kidnapped children are killed, and the bandits cut open their abdomens and eat their hearts, believing that this will make them invulnerable to knives and guns. The remaining human flesh is secretly sold in the market. Therefore, it is generally speculated that this kidnapping behavior is planned and has a fanatical religious background.</p>

<h3>Atomic Car</h3>
<p>Engine Weighs Over 50 Tons</p>
<p>Will Become a Heavy Tank</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chicago, 5th] If one wants to save up to wait for the new type of atomic energy car, thinking that there is no need to refuel or change oil for life, then one will definitely feel disappointed. Because the weight of its engine alone may exceed 50 tons, this new type of atomic car will inevitably become a heavy tank. Moreover, the car price is extremely expensive, and the raw materials for the atomic "fuel" alone may cost US$300,000. In addition, it is necessary to hire a specially trained scientist to serve as the driver.</p>

<h3>How to Rescue the Crisis in the Industrial Sector?</h3>
<p>— Pan Tuhao</p>
<p>Although the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan ended in victory, national finances are depleted and people's livelihoods are ruined. This is precisely the time when all people in the country should endure hardship, strive for production, and economize on consumption to cultivate vitality. Our country is known as an agricultural nation, but we still rely on external sources for food and fuel. For clothing raw materials like flowered cloth, poor transportation in the northwest production areas leads to goods being abandoned on the ground, so we compete to purchase American and Indian cotton to supplement them. The ordering of other foreign products has become a lucrative opportunity for general industrialists and merchants. In addition, labor unrest is surging, and costs are too high, making it impossible to compete with foreign goods. As a result, factories have reduced their scale one after another, preferring to let capital become idle funds or to sell foreign goods in order to survive. If this trend continues, the entire industrial sector will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the rear areas. I feel a sense of crisis and dare not remain silent, so I express my humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Adjust International Trade Policy. In the history of international trade, there are those who are called mercantilists, who aim to increase exports and reduce imports to increase national wealth. Therefore, it is also known as bullionism. Although its arguments are somewhat biased, they are not without a portion of truth. The so-called advanced and wealthy countries of today, although they have long abandoned this policy on the surface, still adhere to it in substance. In the history of tariffs, there are those who are called protectionists. When domestic industries are not yet sufficient to compete with foreign countries, they often set up barriers to the import of relevant manufactured goods for self-defense. After the end of World War II, the International Monetary Agreement was established, and countries touted the universal removal of these barriers, but internally, they were scheming against each other and unwilling to dismantle their own fences. Countries that claim to have planned and controlled economies are unwilling to open their doors. Because the world today still takes countries as units, there is no one that does not put its own interests first. Given our country's economic poverty and industrial backwardness, tariff barriers should be the last lifeline. Furthermore, national finances and people's livelihoods are extremely depleted. How can we simply rely on foreign countries for the daily necessities of life without seeking self-sufficiency? As for luxury and entertainment goods, they should all be prohibited through taxation, which is something everyone agrees on. However, since foreign exchange was formally listed, although some measures have been established to restrict the import of some non-essential goods, international trade is still an open policy in general! Not to mention that the foreign exchange fund comes from loans and is insufficient to fill the endless leak, how can the fragile civil industry sit idly by and be destroyed without protection? Therefore, international trade policy must be adjusted, and this is a matter of urgent importance. Our country's industrial sector has always had a slogan, "Promote National Goods." This phrase has become a cliché and does not seem exciting enough. But let us consider how production today compares to ten or twenty years ago? How do national finances and people's livelihoods today compare to the period when national goods were being promoted? Therefore, to prescribe the right medicine for the illness, this phrase "Promote National Goods" should be even more important today.</p>
<p>(2) Amend the Taxation System. The taxation of production enterprises should be lighter than that of general enterprises, especially those that are beneficial to people's livelihoods. Those that need to cultivate their strength to compete with foreign goods should also have their tax payment methods specially improved to reduce their costs. There are many precedents for this in the tax history of various countries. At this time when the war has just ended, finances are difficult, and the state is strengthening tax collection, which is unavoidable. However, in addition to replenishing the national treasury, we must consider the taxpayers' ability to bear the burden. Today's income tax, profit tax, business tax, stamp tax, etc., still need to be improved to alleviate the people's strength. In recent years, the industrial sector has been making losses covertly, and except for a very few, all are struggling hard. Merely because of inflation, there is some paper wealth on the books, but can this be truly regarded as an increase in the ability to bear the burden? This is why profit tax must be effectively reduced and exempted. The business tax was originally a behavior tax, and for behaviors that are beneficial to national finances and people's livelihoods, there is no time to support and protect them, so how can we bear to generally levy heavy taxes to frustrate their vitality? Before the business tax was changed to a central tax, the general outline of the business tax collection and its supplementary measures in various provinces were lighter on the taxation of manufacturing enterprises than on general sales industries. Today's construction plan claims to prioritize industry, but the business tax is actually heavier on industry, which is contrary to the original intention of economic construction. As for the stamp tax, which is originally a certificate tax, not only should the stamp duty on wholesale amounts be lower than that on retail amounts, but it seems unnecessary to force merchants to establish certificates for the sake of revenue when the buying and selling parties do not need certificates. Today, even for sole proprietorship industrial and commercial enterprises that do not have investment certificates, tax officials must also specify that the stamp duty be affixed to the side of the capital account according to the book value, which is certainly not the original intention of the legislation! Now that foreign companies' articles of association have finally been amended to delete the phrase "registering and operating in this country," the pressure of foreign merchant capitalism will inevitably increase, while foreign companies' tax burden on profits will be lighter. Should we consider and reduce or exempt the tax burden on our country's production enterprises? We must not remain silent.</p>
<p>(3) Consider Labor Standards. When economists talk about production, they must mention capital and labor as the two major factors. Today, everyone has harmonious labor-management relations as a mantra, because production enterprises can only develop if both labor and management are taken care of. Therefore, the living and welfare of workers must be taken care of by the capital side, and the labor side should not ignore the profits and burdens of the capital side. Contemporary scholars of industrial economics all praise the United States, but it should be known that whenever labor wages increase in the United States, its production index and sales price of products must also have a corresponding increase. Only in this way can it be said to be truly harmonious. If, under the oppression of foreign merchant capitalism, the fledgling industry is precarious and cannot last long, and the efficiency is decreasing and the output is decreasing, while simply unilaterally increasing wages and increasing base salaries, this can only be said to be "monotonous," how can there be any "harmony"? Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the people's livelihood is still very difficult. Any class should stop at the right time and should not seek excessive enjoyment. Look at the United States today, its general wages are still around one dollar, and people's consumption is still subject to general restrictions, which is something to think about deeply.</p>
<p>The above three points are clearly difficult to implement, but in order to save the unprecedented crisis in the industrial sector, it is essential that we all work together with one heart to overcome this difficulty. I have heard from the import and export industry that those in charge of trade with China in the United States have warned their exporters that China's purchasing power is weak and worrying, and they have stated that except for a few native products such as wolf skins, it is difficult for American sales to improve in China, especially silk and tea. The imbalance of import and export trade is such that even though we are not aware of it, others are already worried for us, which is a cause for concern. I have also heard from the textile industry that the Allied forces are planning to lend the textile equipment of the enemy country to flowered cloth in order to guide its resumption of work so that it can supply manufactured goods for export. Our country may still think that it is the only one in the Far East industry after the war, but how can we not think about it deeply?</p>

<h3>Over Ten American Merchant Ships Fully Loaded with Goods Awaiting Entry; Limited Number of Berths in the Huangpu River and Zhong River Insufficient for Mooring</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] In this city, only the President's Wharf at Bailianjing, Yitaixing Wharf, Gonghexing, Lanyanyu, and the former Mitsubishi Wharf north of the Waibaidu Bridge can still accommodate ships. The rest of the wharves were occupied by Japanese invaders during the war, and have fallen into disrepair and are silted up. Foreign ships have nowhere to berth except in the stream. However, after the victory, a large amount of American relief supplies arrived, and there are many ships, but the number of berths is limited. Even the barges used to unload goods are mostly damaged, resulting in insufficient supply. Not only do many ships have to anchor outside Wusongkou waiting because the berths inside the port are not empty, but also the ships that have entered the port to unload goods must remain for a considerable period of time. According to people in the shipping industry, not only are ship schedules lost, but other expenses are also staggering. Currently, the American President Lines and Fulei Shipping Company alone have more than ten ships that have entered the port and are unloading goods. Those waiting outside the port include the American President Lines' Jiexi Xu Paike, Shiweisi Mai'erweiduoliya, Kaipi Pili, and Liqinuowei Duoliya. Fulei Company's Kedikewei Duoliya, Ka'erqi Paishi, and Qiongnixue Tuo. The above-mentioned ships are carrying large quantities of relief supplies and commodities. It is said that Fulei Company's Ka'erqi Paishi is scheduled to enter the port this morning, and Qiongnixue Tuo has a total of twenty-seven passengers. The two ships are scheduled to berth at berths 43, 41, and 14. These berths are near Wusong, a long distance away. The company has decided to send a small boat to pick up the passengers this afternoon and land them at the Customs Wharf at 4 or 5 PM. In addition, there are reportedly more than five other companies' freighters anchored outside the port, all fully loaded with cargo.</p>
<h3>Thirty-Four German Firms to Be Sold After Liquidation</h3>
<p>According to sources at the German Properties Liquidation Office, the office has taken over 34 German firms. Except for Deshi, Deyi, Hengshi, and Sanxing, which had already closed down and could not be liquidated, the remaining 31 firms, including Defu, have been merged and liquidated by the office. In terms of materials, 1,300 kinds of dyes, over 1,000 kinds of Western medicines, and hundreds of mechanical instruments have been received.

<h3>Drug Cases Are Generally Tried by the Courts; The Municipal Government Allocates 17 Million Yuan to Cover the Expenses of Setting Up a Testing Center</h3>
<p>(Our dispatch) Regarding drug cases, the Executive Yuan of the National Government has previously issued an order that they should be transferred to the judicial organs for trial in accordance with the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations. The Shanghai District Court officially received a notice from Mayor Qian of the Municipal Government yesterday that drug cases in this city will generally be accepted by the court thereafter. [In addition, it is reported] The Municipal Police Department has registered a total of more than 6,000 drug addicts for self-rehabilitation in order to eliminate drug criminals.

<p>Deputy Mayor He Explains the Meaning of Joint Guarantee</p>
<p>Regarding the anti-drug laws promulgated by the Municipal Government and the Police Department, one of which is the joint guarantee provision. Deputy Mayor He explained to reporters that if the joint guarantee law for drug prohibition is implemented in accordance with the central government's regulations, it must be a horizontal and vertical joint guarantee, that is, the neighborhood head who is caught by the police will also be subject to the same crime, but this law is unfair because it involves the general public. Therefore, Deputy Mayor He has suggested in the municipal government meeting that this method should be revised, and only the family members in the same household should be implicated. The head of the household must be jointly responsible, and the family members should also report to the authorities. Those who keep it secret must also be jointly responsible. Because (1) the head of the household is responsible for supervising all crimes (including smoking) of family members, and (2) family members should be aware of smokers in the family, so implementation is fair and reasonable, and in principle, it is still consistent with the central government's laws. He continued to say that drug prohibition is the most serious policy of the country. If it is prohibited but not implemented properly, it will inevitably produce great malpractices. Therefore, he believes that drug prohibition must be thoroughly prohibited.</p>

<h3>Small Foreman Suspected of Being a Traitor; Once Recruited Labor for the Enemy; Victim Returns Victorious, Wife and Children Scattered</h3>
<p>[Report from our reporter] Cai A'ping, also known as Cai Lianxi, 44 years old, from Yangzhou, was a small foreman at the Dada Wharf in this city before the war. Recently, he was reported to the High Procuratorate by Lu Zhaozhou and Zhou Shunguo, who alleged that Cai was suspected of being a traitor. After investigation, he was indicted. Yesterday, the collegiate bench of the High Court tried the case. The informants testified in court that in April of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), Cai recruited more than 40 workers in Pudong for the enemy, claiming that they were going to the city center to demolish houses and repair roads, and that they would be transported by trucks every day. At that time, because they needed to make a living, and it was within this city, and there was transportation, they saw no inconvenience and responded to the call. Who knew that after getting on the truck, they were escorted by enemy soldiers armed with guns to the North Railway Station, boarded a train to Hangzhou, and were forced to do hard labor such as building roads and carrying ammunition. Later, they were transferred to Xiaoshan, Ningbo, the Zhoushan Islands, and other places, where they were unable to eat their fill every day, and were subjected to fists and kicks at the slightest dissatisfaction. They barely survived until after the victory, when they returned to Shanghai, only to find that their wife and children had been scattered. Therefore, they requested the court to redress their grievances. The defendant argued that after resigning from his position as a small foreman at the wharf, he had made a living by running a rice stall. This was entirely due to private grudges and malicious accusations. He requested the court to investigate thoroughly. Subsequently, the prosecutor presented the indictment. Wang Hengyi, a lawyer appointed by the court, provided pro bono defense for the defendant. The court adjourned the debate and scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of the 18th.</p>

Subsequently, Abe Minoru was summoned. His testimony was the same as the defendant's. The court ordered a retrial at a later date.</p>

<h3>Repairing North China Railways; Political Issues More Serious Than Technical Ones; Head of the Executive Yuan Engineering Planning Team Makes Remarks After Returning to Shanghai from Inspection</h3>
<p>[Report from our reporter] The Executive Yuan Engineering Planning Team departed on the 3rd of this month to investigate the railway situation in North China. The head of the team, Hou Jiayuan, and his party returned to Shanghai on the 9th. We are pleased to report their remarks as follows: The construction of Tanggu Port was secretly built by the enemy, and the drawings have not yet been handed over. On the surface, the layout is still livable, but there are many improper details. From an engineering point of view, improper details cannot be ignored. In addition, there are also improper aspects of the port's ship lock and the first pier. The first step of the current work is to organize dredgers and other mechanical materials, but because six months have passed, the above-ground and underground conditions have changed, and all must be re-measured and the design corrected. The Executive Yuan attaches great importance to this work, and construction will definitely begin soon to satisfy the hopes of the people. As for the rush repair of various sections of the railway, preparations are being made. Although there is a shortage of materials, and due to the previous situation, there are political issues involved, making it more difficult to send workers to advance and rush repairs than the technical issues. Although the implementation team is constantly consulting, the work efficiency is still low. Engineers have been dispatched to inspect both of the above items in detail, and the task will be completed soon, and a report will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. In the past few months, the railway authorities have done their best to repair the railway, moving sleepers and steel rails from east to west in order to quickly restore traffic.</p>

In principle, the loans obtained by the grain merchants are specifically for purchasing rice from rice-producing areas and transporting it to Shanghai for sale, and shall not be used for other purposes. Within one month after the loans are issued, the Grain Administration Office will assess the performance of each loan-receiving grain merchant in transporting, selling, and using the loans, and then decide whether to continue lending funds.

<h3>Large Holders Take Profits; Public Bond Market Weakens; Hua Stock Still Struggles with Bulls and Bears</h3>
<p>Yesterday, public bonds weakened as profit-takers exited en masse. Since large holders did not support the market, the market situation weakened. Category C bonds opened at around 4,800 yuan in the morning. Large holders tried to lure in the market before shorting, first showing around 4,950 yuan before falling to around 4,450 yuan. At noon, they struggled below 4,600 yuan. As a result, categories A, B, and E fell by more than 300 yuan compared to the previous closing. Category D bonds had fallen too much the previous day, and only fell by more than 100 yuan yesterday. Category C bonds fell by more than 400 yuan. Hua stocks were all manipulated by dealers, and the bulls and bears struggled endlessly. Although the opening felt hopeless, the bulls tried hard to support the market. Although Yong Yarn fell to 4,750 yuan, Meiya fell to 3,800 yuan, and Jingfu fell to 405 yuan, they soon gradually pulled back up and supported the market for a long time. In the middle, the situation was extremely uncertain. Until noon, the bulls did their best to pull up the market, and retail investors were slightly squeezed. Yong Yarn once rose back to 5,200 yuan, Meiya rose to 4,200 yuan, and Jingfu rose to 435 yuan. The closing at noon was slightly higher. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the three hot stocks were stable, and other stocks continued to fall. There was no after-hours trading in the afternoon. Foreign stocks were still traded by people in the Hua stock industry, but the volume of transactions was not high. Yisha was still the target of pursuit by powerful figures in the securities industry. The process was steady. Yinglian had fewer chips, and there was a possibility of surpassing Yisha. The closing at noon was slightly higher than the previous closing, except for Yeguang, which fell by 10%, and the paper industry, which fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Gold and Banknotes Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange rate was quite stable. It opened at 1.45 million in the morning and gradually fell slightly to 1.46 million after opening. Short sellers closed their positions because of the report that the Bank of China solemnly denied the lengthening of the US dollar exchange rate, and once fell to 1.425 million, and then turned stable. At noon, it hovered around 1.44 million. In the afternoon, it was not easy for those with funds to release profits, and the stock market was closed. The buying interest in the gold market moved slightly, and it closed at a high price, up 30,000 from the previous closing. Ornaments were 160,000, silver bullion was 1,500, silver dollars were 1,030. The shadow interest rate was still loose, with interest rates ranging from 13% to 16%.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollar opened at 1,885 yuan with sellers. The Bank of China denied that the US dollar exchange rate would change and emphasized that a large loan had matured, which was enough to stabilize the currency value. Buyers returned to the sidelines, and the low price was 1,865 yuan, and then the situation stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, the gold price rose slightly and was also brought up. As a result, it rose by 15 yuan compared to the previous closing. Hong Kong dollars were stable. Importers absorbed some, and as a result, old goods rose by 5 yuan and new goods rose by 8 yuan. Robi Hong Kong electricity was still around the previous price.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market digested slowly and the prices were mediocre. There was little supply and demand for flour, and the market situation lacked ups and downs for the time being. After a sharp drop in oil prices, production and consumption were inverted. When things reached the extreme, they rebounded. Raw soybean oil stopped falling and rose, rising back to 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybeans also rose by 500 to 600 yuan along with the rise in various items, but the elimination was still slack, and there was no excessive rise. Bean cakes also rose by 100 to 200 yuan, and the transaction volume was not large. Wheat bran was in high demand and continued to rise by 200 to 300 yuan. Raw peanuts were slightly firmer by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, but corn was still depressed, and cottonseed cake was down another 100 to 200 yuan.</p>
<p>According to the rice market, yesterday a total of more than 6,000 piculs of seven types of rice arrived in the city. The types and piculs are as follows: 3,591 piculs of white japonica rice, 105 piculs of white yuan, 180 piculs of Yangxian rice, 349 piculs of Duxian rice, 1,320 piculs of early rice, 1,204 piculs of thin rice, and 35 piculs of Yinyuan.</p>
<h3>Raw Rapeseed Oil Distribution; Divided into Three Groups... Limited to Three Days</h3>
<p>The Chinese Vegetable Oil Plant has stipulated that the date for retailers to pick up this batch of raw rapeseed oil will be the 11th, 12th, and 13th of this month, for three days. Retail stores are divided into three groups, A, B, and C, each with 200 stores. Group A picked up goods yesterday afternoon, and Groups B and C will pick up goods separately today and tomorrow. It is heard that each household is assigned one barrel of raw rapeseed oil, each barrel with a net weight of 350 catties, calculated at 38,500 yuan per picul, totaling 134,750 yuan. The payment must be paid to Zhejiang Industrial Bank on the morning of the pick-up date.</p>
<h3>Sugar Listed Price Falls Again</h3>
<p>In yesterday's sugar market, the guild auctioned off another batch of sugar, totaling 4,000 bags. The price was reduced again. The price of medium white sugar was 44,000 yuan, and the price of raw sugar was 43,000 yuan, and none of them were sold out. It can be seen that the intake is sluggish. There were also three and a half cars of white sugar, with a hundred or so bags, priced at 65,000 yuan, which sold for 70,000 yuan. The price of medium sugar was 46,000 yuan, and other prices also had a small following.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Trading Is Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market fluctuated very slightly. Customer sales remained stagnant. Holders of goods insisted on the original price because the listing price of the Textile Construction Company yesterday was limited, and they were unwilling to sell cheaply, resulting in a situation of resistance. There were not many transactions and there was not much change. The prices were roughly the same as before. Only the price of 20-count white airships rose by 20,000 yuan. People's minds were calm. As usual, Textile Construction Company sold cotton cloth, with a total of 19 types, and opened 20 types of Mexican cloth. Cotton yarn will be sold today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton continued to rise by 3 to 8 points. The price of nearby American gold was 28.14, the price of deferred gold was 28.29, and the price of Middling spot was 28.71. The local spot cotton trading was completely stopped. It is expected that without special developments in the environment, cotton yarn and cotton cloth will not improve much. Manufacturers and cotton merchants have small minds and are very low in price, making negotiations difficult, so that Textile Construction and private yarn mills have no transactions to do.</p>
<h3>American Lumber Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Previously, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's N3 new wheel ship brought a large amount of railway sleepers and lumber from the United States to Shanghai. Today, the Cortic Victoria ship, managed by Fulaike Company, brought 1.3 million feet of lumber from Vancouver and arrived at Wusongkou. Because there is no space in the wharf buoys in the port, it is temporarily anchored outside the port. When the wharf buoys are free, it will be imported and unloaded. In addition, the Sanbei Company's Mingxing wheel ship arrived at the port, bringing 9,000 pieces of wood boards from Fuzhou and 200 tons of white rice from Wenzhou. It is heard that the rice is reported to be installed by the Logistics Department.</p>
<p>Rapeseed Cake is Transported to Taiwan. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Beitai Wheel Ship Left Shanghai for Keelung yesterday morning. In addition to the public goods it transported, there were 290,840 pieces of rapeseed cake.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the North Goods Industry</h3>
<p>The Merchants Ask the Guild to Amend the Regulations</p>
<p>[Report from our reporter] In the North Goods market, the same industry guild reorganized the new regulations, limiting the delivery of goods within seven days for customer goods transactions and payment within ten days. This has caused dissatisfaction among North Goods merchants and house merchants. They all believe that in this high-interest environment, it will increase costs. The two sides have been at odds since then, and business has not been done. It is now learned that after several days of consultations, the North Goods merchants and house merchants Yongyitang and Yuantang have decided to first send representatives to negotiate with the guild to amend the regulations.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the unfreezing of funds in the United States, according to banking sources, the amount applied for to purchase imported materials has reached as high as US$100 million.

<p>The Shanghai Grain Administration Commissioner's Office has now commissioned Xie Guoying, a consultant to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, to go to Vietnam to purchase a large amount of rice and transport it to Shanghai. Mr. Xie will start his journey within days.</p>
<p>According to news from the Maritime Administration, a large-scale shipping company will be jointly established by Chinese merchants and American merchants in this city. Chinese merchants will have more than double the capital of American merchants. It is planned to order five to ten commercial ships from the United States to operate along China's coastal ports.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Branch of the Central Bank is now setting up a preparatory office at 15 the Bund, with the deputy manager already appointed. All personnel can go there in the short term.

<p>Regarding rice transit, the Commissioner of the Ministry of Grain stipulates that there must be supporting documents. The method is as follows: (1) Invoices from rice-producing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; (2) Certificates from rice merchant guilds in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; (3) Shipping receipts from ships, railways, or highways; otherwise, transit will not be allowed.</p>
<h3>Mingqian Tea from Wenzhou; Market Price Agreed Yesterday; 500,000 Yuan per Picul; The Market Price of New Longjing Tea from Hangzhou Plummets</h3>
<p>Mingqian New Qiang Tea is produced earliest in Wenzhou. This year, due to transportation reasons, it was delayed until recently, arriving in this city at the same time as the goods from Hangzhou. Although Hangzhou Longjing has already started to be traded, the cargo side of Wenzhou Mingqian insisted on selling, so the market has not yet opened. Yesterday, the market negotiated again, and as a result, the price was agreed at 500,000 yuan per picul. As for the new Longjing tea from Hangzhou, the source has been endless recently, and the market situation has fallen all the way. At present, the industry is discounting the price, reducing the price by 1.78 million yuan per batch, which is more than 890,000 yuan lower than before. Looking at the current situation, the number of goods arriving in Shanghai from the producing areas will continue to increase, and the support disk will not be stable. In addition, the new Mao Feng tea from Huizhou Huangshan, which is most popular among the shops and villages on this street, is now reported to have been weighed in the producing area, reaching 640,000 yuan per picul, and may arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>

<h3>National University Professors Host Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>Report on the Course of the Strike</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Representatives from the joint council of professors from National Chiao Tung University, Fudan University, Tongji University, National Anhwei University, and other institutions hosted reporters at the restaurant on the ninth floor of the YMCA in the Pa Hsein Chiao area of the city at noon yesterday to discuss the issue of requesting improved treatment. Chen Shih-ying, Chairman of Chiao Tung University, reported on the negotiations with Vice Minister Hang Li-wu of the Ministry of Education, stating that National University professors felt the pressure of life and launched a movement to improve treatment in February of this year, appealing to all parties. The Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee resolved to submit a proposal to the government for review regarding improving the treatment of teachers, and the National Political Council also resolved to request that the government substantially improve the treatment of higher education personnel. To this day, the government has ignored this. Recently, due to the strike first initiated by Chiao Tung University, Vice Minister Hang Li-wu rushed to Shanghai to handle the situation, only agreeing to find ways to increase the special living allowance by 40,000 yuan, and to change the experiment fee from 2,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan. However, these increases still require approval from higher authorities. Today, the treatment of professors is far less than that of ordinary workers, and the future is extremely worrying. The Joint Council of Representatives of Professors from National Universities and Colleges in Shanghai has resolved to continue promoting the strike movement to urge the government to substantially improve treatment. Finally, Professors Chen Da-hsieh, Ying Kung-chiu, Chang Hai-cheng, Pan Chien-ching, Liu Hsien, Wang Kung-mou, Tsai Li-peng, and Ku Pao-chang spoke successively, clarifying that this strike should not be equated with a general strike or slowdown by workers, and that what the professors are demanding should not be viewed as merely solving the most basic living needs. If they can only barely afford food, and still have to chop firewood, cook, and take care of children, how can they concentrate on teaching, and so on. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Private Schools Collecting Second Tuition Fee: Proponents and Opponents Held Meetings Yesterday to Discuss</h3>

<h3>General Dai Li's Style</h3>
<p>— April 5, Nanjing Aviation News, Sent by Jiu Rong</p>
<p>After the death of General Dai Li, Director of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, on March 17, not only Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was deeply saddened, but also all his friends were deeply mourned. This reporter pursued the past and wrote this article to express our condolences.</p>
<p>Studying in Childhood - Taking Cake as Lunch</p>
<p>General Dai came from an extremely poor family. When he was studying in his childhood, his school was very far from his home, so he had to go out early and return late every day. At noon, he would eat the cake his mother gave him. When he was admitted to military school, he never enjoyed the happiness that children had, because his father died early. So he grew up under the care of his mother. He was impressed by the story of Yue Mu's tattoo.</p>
<p>He was short and fat, with rough and dark skin, and deep eyes. Whether he was giving a speech or talking to his subordinates, he gave people an incredible sense of respect and majesty, especially his loud voice and vivid tone, which were full of vitality.</p>
<p>After September 18 Incident, The Juntong Bureau Was Born</p>
<p>After the September 18 Incident, in order to resist foreign aggression, the Juntong Bureau was born. At that time, the focus of the work was to punish the enemies and traitors, to eliminate corruption and people who hindered the interests of the country. Therefore, it became the enemy of the enemies and traitors, and caused resentment and hatred among corrupt officials and some political parties. At that time, their lives were very hard. Most of the subordinates wore blue cloth long shirts (at that time, blue cloth was the cheapest). The name "Blue Shirt Society" is still circulating among the people. I remember that at that time, the monthly expenses were very small, so it was common to buy a few sesame cakes to fill his stomach. This frugal style has become General Dai's habit.</p>
<p>Careful and Calm - Escaping Danger Many Times</p>
<p>General Dai was always very considerate, careful, and dedicated in everything he did. No matter what kind of turbulent environment he was in, he was still very calm. Otherwise, it would be difficult to escape danger many times. He wrote every word, folded every letter neatly. Even doing such a small thing as packing his luggage, he would do it himself.</p>
<p>General Dai attached great importance to the information collected by his subordinates and did not allow any fabrication or error. I heard that one subordinate was ordered to be executed because he misused a word in the information. General Dai especially hated his subordinates' corruption. A female mail inspector who was responsible for checking letters was also punished on the spot for embezzling 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Hard Life - No Remarriage After Death of His Wife</p>
<p>Their lives were very difficult. Although civil servants received salary increases one after another, they still lived under the high pressure of prices. In order to increase work efficiency and reduce personal burden, unmarried comrades, both men and women, were not allowed to marry. General Dai also did not remarry. It is said that this ban was lifted with the victory of the War of Resistance, but there were still few marriages. The burden of the family was too terrible for the revolutionary comrades.</p>
<p>Like a Family Head - Promoting a Pure Family Style</p>
<p>Their office hours were eight hours on a hard bench during the day, and two and a half hours in the evening. They only had half a day off a week. On festivals or major anniversaries, General Dai accompanied his subordinates for dinner. The subordinates regarded the group as a family, and General Dai became the head of the revolutionary family. Continuing the glorious history and promoting a pure family style were the two instructions they could not forget. No matter who they were, they all had the excellent virtues of hard work, perseverance, and willingness to endure hardship.</p>
<p>Annual Public Memorial Service for Martyrs</p>
<p>Under the leadership of General Dai, more than 100,000 comrades worked, and unfortunately, thousands of people were killed by the enemies. Every July 7, they will hold a memorial service, and the families of all the martyrs will come to pay their respects. In the memorial hall, some parents cry with the portraits of their children, and some children cry and recite the date of their parents' death and the tragic events before their death. General Dai always used "We must have an attitude that children can be taught, and a spirit that young people are admirable" to comfort the bereaved families of the martyrs. This year's × month × day, I don't know how the subordinates will mourn the leader of the underground work - General Dai!</p>
<p>All Bereaved Families Are Given Preferential Treatment</p>
<p>All the family members of the martyrs can be introduced to work in the production cooperatives. These children can enter the primary school run by the bureau to study free of charge. The teachers in the school take turns leading the class, eating, and sleeping. Because of this preferential treatment for the family members of the martyrs, they will die in the occupied areas as if they were returning home.</p>
<p>In Order to Arrest Traitors - Flying to Peiping Many Times</p>
<p>After the news of the victory came, because traffic could not be restored for a while, the National Army could not go east, and the liberated areas appeared extremely chaotic. If General Dai had not ordered the underground workers to use the power of defecting puppet troops to maintain local security, I am afraid that the liberated areas would be even more difficult to get on the right track at this time.</p>
<p>In order to arrest the traitors, General Dai personally flew to Peiping many times to make sure that the big and small traitors were caught. Indeed, this can at least give the good people a chance to vent their anger.</p>
<p>Fighting Hard All His Life - The Family Is Still Poor</p>
<p>He never met with newspaper reporters, and rarely attended public gatherings. He had no intention of being promoted or making a fortune, so after more than ten years of hard work, his family is still poor. He is indeed a most healthy revolutionary, so his death is not only a reason for Chairman Chiang and his subordinates to be sad, but also for the reporter to cry for the shocking bad news for the suffering motherland!</p>
<h3>The Water of the Yellow River Comes from Heaven - The Yellow River Control Project is Scheduled to be Completed by the End of June - Mobilizing 150,000 Workers Between Kaifeng and Zhengzhou</h3>
<p>— April 1, Kaifeng Correspondence, Sent by Jin Ming</p>
<p>Isn't there a line in Li Bai's poem: "The water of the Yellow River comes from heaven"? Today, people say: The Yellow River is a yellow disaster. The severity of its disasters is a common sigh throughout the ages, deeply felt at home and abroad. For decades, the Water Conservancy Research Association has compiled statistical tables (such as the Henan Weather Forecast Experiment Comparison Table, etc.), which were completed in 1942. Summarizing the results of its experiments, it is roughly as follows in Table 128:</p>
<p>No Way to Control Floods - Lack of Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Yu-tang of the Water Conservancy Research Association has written a massive "Flood Control Strategy." He said that Emperor Shun killed Gun, which has been set for thousands of years. Xia Yu dug rivers, which is a magical feat for all ages. However, since the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties in our country, there have been disasters every year. All of this is because scholars who talk about water do not follow Yu but follow Gun. Some people stubbornly stick to their own opinions out of thin air. They do not understand the principles of water management and mislead themselves and others. They do not thoroughly review according to scientific methods and directly block the Yellow River's northern flow and tributaries. When a terrible disaster is caused and the people are angry, they impeach each other, only to realize that a big mistake has been made. Some resign or ask for punishment, or no longer block the river after the event. They lack disaster relief methods, so the people suffer miserably.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the policies for the Yellow River control project have not met actual needs and scientific principles. According to Mr. Yang Yu-tang, there are as many as eight main policies that are not beneficial and have hidden dangers:</p>
<p>(1) Blocking the breach and setting up a large gate in Jing-shui Town. However, one gate cannot accommodate the entire river flow, and it will inevitably collapse as before, which is what is called storing water to drown oneself.</p>
<p>(2) Blocking the giant river and dredging the tributaries.</p>
<p>(3) Blocking the upper reaches and dredging the lower reaches.</p>
<p>(4) Blocking the breach without considering anything else.</p>
<p>(5) Blocking the breach and delaying the opening of the sluice gate.</p>
<p>(6) Blocking the breach and not opening the gate to release water.</p>
<p>(7) Blocking the breach and adding dikes to firmly guard the gates and dams.</p>
<p>(8) Blocking all tributaries and storing water to stop sand, but claiming that the water coming from the river flushes the sand away.</p>
<p>The above policies are either preventing the river or causing disasters. They are either abandoning the fundamentals or focusing on the trivial. There is no good result to be said.</p>
<p>Divert the Yellow River into the Wei River and Return to its Old Course</p>
<p>Now, the Yellow River problem is the main goal of the current restoration and construction work. This time, Mr. Ji Long-tu of the Water Conservancy Research Association firmly advocates diverting the Yellow River into the Wei River and returning to its old course. The method is: (1) Diverting the Yellow River from the area between Wuzhi and Xinxiang into the Wei River, to Tianjin, out of Dagu, Xingang, and into the sea, and guiding the Huai River into the sea. (2) Reducing the Zhongmu breach, setting up more overflow dikes, and opening the gates and dams early. (3) If we mistakenly take the Huai and Ji Rivers as the old course of the Yellow River and firmly block the breach and protect the gates and dams, then there will be drought above and flood below. Henan will be a wasteland as before, and Shandong, Hebei, and northern Jiangsu will become a swamp. (4) If the breach is not reduced and the gates and dams are not opened, then Henan will have the phenomenon of northern drought and southern water, and Anhui and Hubei will become flood-stricken areas. (5) If the breach is not firmly blocked and is blocked and breached repeatedly, then Henan will have several disasters in a year, and it will inevitably affect the neighboring provinces in the southeast. (6) The climate in winter and spring is abnormal, and the water level in various places is also rising. When summer and autumn come, the snow melts from the mountains, and heavy rains occur from time to time. At the same time, the area north of Henan is particularly dangerous, because the land is mostly wasteland, and locust plagues are easy to breed.</p>
<p>Project Completed Before the Flood</p>
<p>The most gratifying and worthy news to report to the people of the country is that the Yellow River control work has clearly entered the practical stage from the research stage. The major water conservancy plan of our country and the ten-year dike repair plan have been reviewed and approved by the government's standing committee. Under the sincere cooperation of the Ministry of Communications, the Resources Commission, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Yellow River control project has begun to be actively promoted. The required raw materials and supplies are being transported from Shanghai to Kaifeng, totaling one million tons per day, to meet the needs of the Yellow River control project. According to experts participating in this project plan, the mobilization of workers will reach 150,000 people, and it is expected to be completed at the latest before the river water rises in June of this year. After the completion of this UNRRA plan, it will enable our two million acres of land that were previously destroyed to restore its full agricultural productivity, and the "Yellow Peril" that has not been treated will be avoided in time.</p>
<p>Since Zhao Song blocked the Yellow River and the north flowed across the country, the province of Henan, where the crux of the waterway has not been resolved for thousands of years, has suffered exceptionally heavy water and drought disasters, and the number of times has been particularly numerous. Therefore, when the good news of the joint UNRRA, CNRRA, Ministry of Communications, and Resources Commission's Yellow River relief and treatment project came, all sectors here placed the warmest hope.</p>
<h3>Jin Launches Comprehensive Movement: Integrating Soldiers and Farmers</h3>
<p>— Taiyuan Airmail Dispatch, March 20th, by Jian Chen</p>
<p>The land question is a major issue in world history. With the rise of modern socialism, this issue has become even more important to social policymakers and revolutionaries. The security of a nation and the rise and fall of world affairs are closely related to the land question. During the late stages of the Anti-Japanese War, due to the increasing severity of troop and food supply problems, and confined to the western Shanxi region under the jurisdiction of the Second War Zone on the east bank of the Yellow River in North China, Shanxi province, due to its uniquely difficult situation, demonstrated a revolutionary measure in the land arena: the implementation of "soldier-farmer integration." This had already been approved by a central government order in November of last year to be carried out experimentally in Shanxi Province, becoming the core of Shanxi's governance.</p>
<p>Origins of Implementation</p>
<p>The people of Shanxi have traditionally been reluctant to join the army, and the province was among the first to fall under enemy occupation. The Second War Zone relied on only a dozen of the most barren mountainous counties in western Shanxi as its base for resistance. Among these, only Da Ning, Yonghe, Xi County, Xiangning, Pu County, and Shilou County were intact. Statistics show that the entire free area had a population of no more than two million. The region was barren and the people had little savings. After young men were conscripted into the army, their families had no support. Even those who escaped amidst the chaos dared not return home. Eventually, the fields lay fallow, the source of soldiers was exhausted, the military and the people were in dire straits, and the war situation was precarious. In order to support the precarious war situation, the chief officer believed that it was necessary to achieve "more people fighting, more people farming, good people fighting, good people farming" to simultaneously address the welfare of both the military and the people. Therefore, at the administrative meeting held by the high command on August 15th of the thirty-second year of the Republic, the above sixteen-character slogan was proposed, based on which the soldier-farmer integration plan was drafted. It was remotely inspired by the "well-field" system of the Three Dynasties and the "fubing" system of the Tang Dynasty, taking their strengths and discarding their weaknesses. Furthermore, Mr. Yan claimed that it followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teaching of "equalization of land rights" as a fair and thorough method, which could achieve "those who till the land have land to cultivate," serving as a necessary stopping point on the way to "those who till the land own the land." Its effectiveness lies in "treating national defense issues and land issues as one and addressing them together; fusing national revolution and social revolution into one furnace to resolve them." The concrete implementation of soldier-farmer integration can be broadly divided into three major steps: organization, land allocation, and equal distribution of grain.</p>
<p>Organization and Land Allocation</p>
<p>Organization and land allocation follow the Conscription Law. All men aged eighteen to forty-seven are considered eligible for military service. Each village is taken as the unit. Every three eligible young men are organized into a soldier-farmer mutual aid group. One serves in the regular army, going off to war to defend the country, while two serve in the national army, farming at home. It is stipulated that each national army soldier must provide the regular army soldier's family with five shi of wheat and ten jin of cotton annually, as well as discretionary help with firewood, water, and other tasks that require effort but not money. Infantrymen are demobilized every three years, and cavalry and artillerymen every four years, rotating service. Those who exceed the age limit are discharged, and those who reach the age limit are organized. Organization adopts a voluntary combination method; if they cannot agree, a lottery method is used to decide. The elderly, young, and women who are below or above the eligible age can all assist in cultivation, while the national army soldier who receives land allocation is the main cultivator.</p>
<p>Division of Land</p>
<p>The division of land refers to the Land Law, in which land is re-divided, taking the residential village (as a deputy village under the administration of a governing village, which is a newly compiled system of village governance in Shanxi Province) as the unit. Each allotment does not exceed five plots, matched with good and bad land. The income from each allotment, after deducting land taxes and land rent, is sufficient to provide a net income of twenty shi of grain, enough to feed eight people and enough for two farmers to cultivate. Those assisting in cultivation are allocated food rations based on the size of their labor, while the ownership of the land remains with the landlord. The national army soldier gives the landlord one shi of wheat per tael of land silver as land rent, while the national army soldier is responsible for land taxes and other burdens. As for the land allocation method, according to the outline for land division and implementation procedures, cadres first conduct four rounds of household visits to consult with the people, then convene a village-wide propaganda meeting. After that, villagers elect three to five councilors to be responsible for implementing the land division, which is supervised and checked by village cadres to complete the work.</p>
<p>Equal Distribution of Grain</p>
<p>The equal distribution of grain refers to the Land Law, which stipulates grain equalization methods. The land grade is assessed according to land yield to eliminate the accumulated abuses of having no grain without land, land without grain, light grain for good land, heavy grain for bad land, little grain for much land, and much grain for little land. The stipulation that land rent shall not exceed 37.5% of the regular yield is used as the standard for all burdens on farmers receiving land allocation. A progressive standard table for various grain grades is drafted as the grain equalization scale to determine the grain amount for each grade of land. Grain equalization takes the residential village as the unit, ensuring that the original grain amount of the residential village does not increase or decrease, only that its burden is average and reasonable.</p>
<p>Relief and Education</p>
<p>The implementation of soldier-farmer integration leads to many related social problems, the most important of which are the care of the old and weak, and the support of the chronically ill and the helpless. The relief measures are as follows: men aged sixty-five and above, and women aged sixty and above, are organized into nursing care groups to engage in minor work. Those who cannot engage in production and have no one to support them are provided with relief rations. It is stipulated that these relief funds and rations are collected progressively from 20% of the land rent receivable by landlords. In terms of education, due to the increase in social income, compulsory education for eleven years is stipulated for citizens aged six to seventeen. 2% of outstanding students aged eighteen and above are granted public funding to attend school, ensuring equal educational opportunities.</p>
<p>Seizing Land from Lazybones</p>
<p>Lazybones among the national army soldiers who do not work hard in cultivation have their land seized and are given begging certificates, with a deadline to reform themselves before their land is restored. The ideal is to achieve "using work to guarantee life, and using life to manage behavior," aiming for a society with no idlers, no loafers, no poor people, and no ignorant people, ultimately reaching the goal of abolishing criminal law. Therefore, soldier-farmer integration is called a "treasure bowl," and the land allocation is the old family property that ancestors could not get rid of. Soldier-farmer integration does not only manage agriculture while neglecting industry and commerce, nor does it disregard wartime and peacetime, requiring everyone to serve in the regular army. Before the victory, Shanxi Province also separately compiled soldier-industry groups, soldier-mining groups, and soldier-transport groups. Commerce was not included because private businesses were abolished at that time, and all businesses were public. Soldiers are regular soldiers during wartime and can be divided into regular soldiers, national army soldiers, and workers in national defense industries during peacetime.</p>
<p>Current Implementation</p>
<p>After the victory, Yan Xishan traveled to Chongqing. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially assigned Shao Lizi and others to have a detailed conversation with Yan Xishan about soldier-farmer integration. Yan Xishan also gave lectures and introductions to all parties. The central government's explicit order for Shanxi Province to conduct trials was also issued the year before last. Therefore, the comprehensive launch of soldier-farmer integration in Shanxi Province has begun this year. What they fear is that the enemy and puppet regimes have been replaced by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP is propagating the harm of soldier-farmer integration to the people in its recently occupied areas and following it up with the threat of "whoever receives land allocation will be killed." The fierce struggle during this period will inevitably be tragic, but the Shanxi authorities are still advancing with an indomitable spirit, as before. On January 4th, Bo Youcheng, the provincial government committee member in charge of soldier-farmer integration, led seventy-two core cadres to the villages of Sanjie, Shele, and Geliao Gou in the suburbs of Taiyuan to conduct practical training. Upon completing their work within twelve days, Party and state elder Zhang Puquan and domestic and foreign journalists such as Li Bowen of the United Press and the New York Times came to inspect. They all personally visited the villages where it had been implemented. Elder Zhang personally inquired in detail with the old farmers and national army soldiers. Li Bowen and others were precisely at the ceremony of granting land allocation to the national army soldiers. After returning to the city of Bing, Elder Zhang greatly praised it. The journalists must have their own separate records. After the first experiment in the recovered areas, it was followed by the promotion in twenty-five cities and counties, including Taiyuan City, Yangqu, Wutai, and Dai County. It is currently entering a period of comprehensive development. However, because winter wheat was sown into the ground last year, and spring wheat and rice are about to be sown, fearing that it would delay the farming season, while proceeding with organization, land allocation, and grain equalization, it has been announced that "whoever sows, reaps," so that farmers can cultivate with peace of mind. Also, because there are many people in the recovered areas and the Anti-Japanese War has ended, the burden on national army soldiers should be reduced and the benefits for regular army soldiers should be increased. The methods have been revised to organize six people into a soldier-farmer mutual aid group, with one person as a regular army soldier. Each national army soldier provides the regular army soldier's family with three shi of grain (half wheat and half millet) and five jin of cotton. All national army soldiers, in addition to paying preferential grain and flowers and one dou of grain for every two silver taels for help expenses, have no other burdens in any other name. A quarter of the national army soldiers are pure national army soldier groups, that is, all six people are national army soldiers. The preferential grain and flowers and help expenses that each person should pay are all allocated to the county and village expenses. If it is still not enough for the county and village to use, it will be supplemented by another levy of "reasonable burdens." The source of "reasonable burdens" is obtained from the income of non-agricultural workers in industry and commerce. Because it has been decided that young men of military age in industry and commerce will not be organized for the time being, their burdens are divided into two categories: asset interest and occupational profits, that is, money generating interest is taxed at a progressive rate, and the interest generated from labor is taxed at a progressive rate. However, this is only a preliminary proposal and has not yet been finalized. It is heard that detailed regulations are being drafted. (Midnight, March 22nd)</p>

<h3>The Terrifying World of Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Editor: Northern Jiangsu is now a terrifying world, especially the areas around Gao Bai and Pu County. People fleeing to Nantong are arriving every day. In the Communist army, this action is called the "Great Class Struggle of Liquidation," where grievances are avenged, and scores are settled. Assassination is encouraged, special punishments are established, such as the "landmine dragging" and "look-in history" similar to those in Shandong. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist army did not yet reveal its true colors, openly engaging in kidnapping for ransom. Now, they have changed their tactics, greatly expanding their kidnapping efforts, not inferior to the puppet army of Wang Jingwei. They arbitrarily frame the loyal and virtuous, first declaring that the home has hidden firearms and must be surrendered. If the answer is no, they will arbitrarily dig, and then they themselves will take out their own bullets and say they were dug up, and then you will have to pay hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of catties of rice. If you don't have it, they will kill you. After the Political Consultative Conference, they are greatly increasing their kidnapping and killing spree. Which article of the PCC agreement stipulates this? Who can the people of Northern Jiangsu turn to for their suffering? The government watches indifferently, while some scholars are still praising the "liberated areas" in magazines, and some elders, such as Mr. Huang Yanpei, are still blindly supporting Yan'an. I wonder if they would be willing to come and see the suffering of the people of Northern Jiangsu? Alas! This great class struggle of liquidation will kill half of the good people, and the general intellectual youth are also among those being killed. Because with intellectuals, there is an obstacle to the advancement of their "democracy." I want to appeal to your newspaper on behalf of the people of Northern Jiangsu who are being framed. Please ask your newspaper to request the government to find a way to relieve our suffering. We have no other extravagant hopes, only that the Communist army kills a few fewer people. — Of course, they want to kill, who can stop them? — I humbly request your newspaper to publish this, and I will be grateful beyond words.</p>
<p>Respectfully wishing you peace! A Reader from Northern Jiangsu (March 30, 35th year of the Republic)</p>

<h3>Grand Tour, Rhyming with Du Shao Ling's Fifty-Six</h3>
<p>— Gu Yiqiao</p>
<p>In the past, at thirteen or fourteen, I began my grand tour northward, Qinghua's beautiful water and trees, morning and evening my spirit soared. The new literary revolution, Nirvana laments the phoenix, By the pond, I sang of the red candle, Shy was my poetry bag. Orchids and jasmine, A lone goose pours out its burning heart, Azure forests guard Tanzhe, Lush and green, the Western Hills are. Talented scholars gathered, The Great Harmony extends to the Eastern Sea, Bright was the Mid-Autumn Moon, Sending off the distant voyage on Double Ninth Day. The boat set off, raising sea roars, A great catastrophe arrived in Fusang, Suddenly Heaven and Earth were enraged, Tokyo turned to ashes in a single torch. I came to Cambridge as a guest, May's fragrant beauty, Rainbows flew over the waves of the river, Clouds and moon reflected in the cold pond. Brothers rejoiced to reunite, Tears flowed like waves, remembering our mother, Encouraging each other in engineering, Practical learning abandoned poetry. The giant star of the South Sea fell, I was overseas and lonely, The great river flowed east into the sea, The whole nation sobbed with sorrow. A hundred years of opium poison, The shame of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, how could we forget? Classmates, still young, Each moved to different hometowns together. Some took up the teaching whip, Peach and plum trees filled their doorways, Some participated in politics, Positions were established in court. Well-versed Confucians and learned scholars, Their writings released their wild words, I returned, traveling through Europe, Beside the White Mountains and the Black Water. Spring in Jiangnan was beautiful, In the winter month, I knocked on the Yungang Caves, Trudging through snow to find the Green Mound, Testing my horse, shooting at startled cranes. The vast road of the Great Wall, Suiyuan and Xinjiang again, Unforgettable was the September 18th Incident, Enemy cavalry entered Shenyang. The men all laid down their armor, A puppet king stood abolished, I ascended Chicken Cry Temple, Changbai Mountain was dimly lit. I sighed for the New China dream, Crown and robes of the emperor, The May Fourth youth rose up, I stood tall and proud too. The elegant Zhang family son, Danced and drank deeply, Singing aloud by the cold Yi River, The sad white poplars rustled. Grand was the January 28th Incident, I sent troops and horses busily, Shanghai's forty days, The military retreated, the people suffered. Nan Yong was just reciting, The capital moved to Bianliang, Rehe could not be defended, How could just the Northeast be lost? I bid farewell to the capital and went north, Wanting to build a Great Wall long, Yan and Yun were vast and faint, Beacon fires blazed in the southern sky. The Tanggu Truce was signed, Alas for Hebei and Chahar, Young people wept together, The former capital withdrew its troops. We spoke of punishing the rebels, Exposing the ambition of tigers and wolves, The national crisis grew more serious, The powerful neighbors became more arrogant. The top commander worried, Sharpening his sword to save the mortally wounded, Planning to build aviation, Exploring the eagle's flight through academics. Lushan prepared for the sea conference, Blood and tears wrapped our wounds, With one heart and one virtue, Different dreams woke in the same bed. Sincerity was the first to unite, Don't be sad by the shame. The Qin Oath helped Tang, Zhou Wu helped Shao Kang. We sharpened our weapons and fed our horses, Taking orders from the Central Government, The full-scale war of resistance began, Heroes gathered from all directions. Civil and military education were united, The aura began to soar, Pleading to serve the country, Shedding blood was the most glorious. Eight years of sacred war, The Hun horses drank in the blue waves, The Three Rods returned from the Long March, Kunlun glittered like clouds and snow. Suddenly, the atomic bomb was announced, A miracle even more extraordinary, I came to watch the sunset, Flying straight over the sea.</p>

<h3>Regret at the Street Stall</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiqu</p>
<p>When the celebratory firecrackers sparked the first flame in the mountain city, eager friends had already packed their luggage.</p>
<p>"Going back to my hometown! Going back to my hometown!" The people from Jiangnan could not help but shout. The landlord no longer mentioned raising the rent, and the people of Sichuan no longer treated the people from Jiangnan with "non-friendly" attitudes. Everyone knew, "You can't keep them here, they will all be leaving Sichuan soon!"</p>
<p>But "entering Sichuan is easy, leaving is hard." Originally, they came with their families, carrying packages, and boxes, escaping all the way, losing things along the way, escaping to Chongqing, where they lost almost everything. After finding a house in Chongqing and settling down, they lacked clothing for all seasons, and had no tables, chairs, or utensils. They had nothing, so they had to gradually acquire things little by little, star by star, following the ever-increasing prices. Now, they had finally built a home like a snail, and now that they had to hand it over, not to mention the economic reluctance, emotionally it was like facing partners who had shared the hard times, unwilling to abandon them like worn-out shoes. However, in reality, it was absolutely impossible to carry all those bottles and cans onto ships and airplanes, carrying them on their backs like camels all the way back to Jiangnan. So what to do?</p>
<p>The solution was finally quickly found! To conditionally give them to the people of Sichuan, which could avoid the burden of carrying them like a "puppet organization," and also exchange them for some legal currency to subsidize travel expenses. Or bring some Sichuan specialties like silver ear and fritillaria back to give to relatives and friends, so they wouldn't see how poor they were in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Within three days of the victory, Chongqing, from the busiest area around the Spirit Fortress, near the most dignified National Government, to the outskirts of Xiaolongkan, Qingmuguan, Beibei, and Nanquan, along the roads and highways, became a street stall market. The civil servants who had suffered enough for eight years were certainly the most energetic in setting up stalls and selling thoroughly. Even the small merchants who sold cigarettes, the working friends who repaired lights, and even university professors, writers, and celebrities, all did their best to display and sell those Western-style clothes, books, and pickled vegetable jars that they loved but could not "carry."</p>
<p>Setting up a street stall is not like buying gold and U.S. dollars, profiteering from the national crisis, or engaging in speculative business. Doing this does not damage one's reputation, nor can it be said to be greedy for profit. On the contrary, standing by the street stall can indicate: (1) I did not profiteer from the national crisis during the Anti-Japanese War, I can be worthy of the country. (2) I am not corrupt, I can be worthy of my compatriots. (3) I am going back to my hometown soon, eating fish and shrimp, to compensate for the hard days of the past eight years.</p>
<p>Setting up a street stall is different from the peddlers who sell artificial silk stockings for three thousand yuan a pair along the road. Setting up a street stall cannot be listed in the merchant group, and is not subject to the control of officials or bound by prices. Even the police do not dare to interfere arbitrarily. Therefore, whether sitting or standing, there is always a different kind of spirit, definitely not the same as the general small merchants.</p>
<p>At first, they only wanted to find a place to settle those things that could not be carried, and it would be even better if they could exchange them for some legal currency. At first, they did not dare to have the delusion of getting rich from this. Who knew that the result of setting up a street stall was that the money they sold for was several times more than the original purchase price. A daily income of eight to ten thousand yuan was indeed much more profitable than sitting in an office for eight hours a day. When they came back in the evening to calculate the accounts, facing the piles of banknotes, they couldn't help but feel their hearts bloom. If they had known that setting up a street stall was so profitable, why did they bother being civil servants in the first place?</p>
<p>But good times don't last long. Before long, prices rebounded. The overcoat that was originally worth 50,000 yuan, selling it for 25,000 yuan was already a joyful event. Now, looking at the streets, the coarse woolen coats hanging in the shop windows are priced at over 60,000 or 70,000 yuan. They couldn't help but regret that they were too impatient and sold too cheaply. Therefore, some people followed up and increased prices; others simply packed up their parcels and temporarily took a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, the business of those who raised prices was slow, and those who closed their stalls were completely frozen. Delayed and delayed, when there was really hope of leaving, they had to have a special sale, selling at half price or 33% off as old goods. Otherwise, they would have to give them to the landlord as a souvenir!</p>
<p>Compressing a household's belongings into fifteen kilograms, moving from Chongqing to Shanghai. Of course, pots, bowls, spoons, and other items cannot be allowed in these fifteen kilograms. However, pots, bowls, spoons, and the like are as indispensable as clothing, food, housing, and transportation. So when they arrived in Shanghai, they had to raise funds again and purchase them anew. They also had to buy some items that were a bit better than the "products of national crisis" at an even cheaper price to reward themselves. Who knew that Shanghai's prices had already soared, and it was no longer the golden age for those who "flew down from the sky and drilled out of the ground." Not to mention the big companies, even the small shops were just as cunning and intimidating. Helplessly, they had to go to Qiujiang Road to patronize the scalper stalls and look for some old things sold by the Japanese in their "grand repatriation sale" to put together. Because the pots, bowls, spoons, and the like sold by the scalper stalls were exactly what friends from Chongqing who came without seals or gold bars needed for "starting a family and building a career."</p>
<p>The scalper stalls marked off areas as markets, stretching endlessly. Their momentum was similar to the street stall market around Confucius Pond in Chongqing. However, the goods owners who used to sit behind the stalls were now standing in front of the stalls as customers. Affectionate wives, seeing the teacups and water bottles on the scalper stalls, couldn't help but think of those things they had heartlessly sold in Chongqing. Four glass cups were only sold for 400 yuan. What about now? Pointing to a pair of cups on the stall that were similar to the ones they sold, they asked the scalper behind the stall. The scalper stretched out a finger and said categorically: "If you're really buying, one word, 1600, not a penny less."</p>
<p>The wife complained to her husband, and the husband complained about the transportation. Was it really because of the difficulty of transportation and inconvenience of carrying? How did people transport crabs and pressed ducks to Chongqing, and bring Guanggan and pickled mustard to Shanghai? The so-called difficulty is just self-deception for the incompetent! Even if broken copper and scrap iron were really inconvenient to carry, why not pack more easy-to-carry banknotes and gold to bring back? In Chongqing, you could still proclaim yourself clean and honest, wearing "elbow-patched" clothes and "down-to-earth" shoes, showing your hardship. In front of the scalper stalls, I'm afraid that even if you shouted loudly to them and declared how you struggled and worked hard during the Anti-Japanese War, without profiteering from the national crisis or seizing land, no one would give you two teacups to show their condolences. Wouldn't it be like playing the lute to a cow?</p>
<h3>Double Flying (26)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>"You heartless old dog! What do you want? You! You..." Mrs. Mo shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"Father! Father!" Lihua grabbed the hem of Old Master Mo's clothes, crying and begging for mercy.</p>
<p>Old Master Mo ignored her, summoning all the courage he had in his life, gritting his teeth, and hitting! hitting! hitting!</p>
<p>"What do I want? I want to teach you a lesson! I forbid you from going to the theater with that woman from the Weng family again! I forbid you from embarrassing me in public anymore!" Old Master Mo said breathlessly as he hit her.</p>
<p>Mo Sheng and Baoling both arrived. Mo Sheng forcibly pulled Old Master Mo away. Mrs. Mo seized this opportunity, stood up, and lunged forward to bite Old Master Mo's hand. Baoling quickly embraced Mrs. Mo again.</p>
<p>"Young master, quickly pull Madam back to the upper room," Mo Sheng said.</p>
<p>"No, today I must fight him to the death," Mrs. Mo stubbornly tried to rush towards Old Master Mo.</p>
<p>"Mom, talk about it tomorrow. Father is still drunk right now!" Baoling said, forcefully dragging Mrs. Mo towards the door.</p>
<p>"Mom! Mom!" Lihua also cried, pulling Mrs. Mo outwards.</p>
<p>"Get out of my way! You bunch of bastards!" Mrs. Mo spat at the children furiously.</p>
<p>"Madam! It's quiet at night, don't make a scene and become a laughingstock for the neighbors," Mo Sheng said anxiously, pleadingly.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Mo's anger could not be quelled. She jumped wildly; struggled; trying to retaliate against Old Master Mo, whom she believed had no right to abuse her. But Baoling dragged her until she was exhausted, and she had no choice but to walk out of the study involuntarily. She cried with grievance! She wailed loudly, and shouted herself hoarse, scolding Old Master Mo as inhuman, Old Master Mo as ungrateful.</p>
<p>Old Master Mo did not retort to Mrs. Mo, nor did he have the strength to hit her again. At this moment, he felt as if his heart had relaxed a lot, but his body felt so heavy that he couldn't stand. His limbs trembled into a ball, and his upper and lower jaws trembled uncontrollably, his teeth clattering against each other.</p>
<p>"Master, are you cold?" Mo Sheng asked with concern when he saw this situation. He helped Old Master Mo to bed.</p>
<p>"No... no..." Old Master Mo said tremulously.</p>
<p>"Master, you should reason with Madam about anything, you shouldn't resort to violence. This will only hurt your feelings more. Look how angry you are, you're also ruining your own health," Mo Sheng comforted Old Master Mo. He thought that Old Master Mo was trembling with anger.</p>
<p>"She won't reason with me, she always thinks that everything she does is right, she will never listen to a single word I say. Therefore, I was forced to resort to violence once. I'll let her hate me for the rest of her life!" Old Master Mo said excitedly, a painful but victorious smile appearing on his face.</p>

<h3>Seeking Sculpture Expert: Filial Piety of the Brothers Is Exhaustless</h3>
<p>A Reminder That Children Should Fulfill Their Filial Duty to Avoid Regret</p>
<p>Editor: My late father passed away the year after the January 28th Incident, but my mother is still healthy. Although my younger brother and I do not serve her perfectly, we dare not overstep the boundaries of filial piety. Over the years, prices have been high, and we know that our service of providing food and drink has not yet comforted our kind mother. Last year, the Anti-Japanese War was won, and the sky regained its light. We were about to serve our mother and enjoy her twilight years, but alas, "A child wishes to care for his parents, but they are no longer there!" Unfortunately, our mother passed away this month. Thinking of her kindness, we will never forget it. To commemorate and continue serving both parents, we are seeking sculpture technicians and clay figure experts everywhere, so that we can create models of our deceased parents' portraits and worship them in front of the hall, as if they were still alive. But things are not going as we wish. Everywhere we look, we either encounter exorbitant prices, or the works do not resemble the original portraits. My brother and I are unhappy about this day and night. We have always known that your column specializes in serving the public, so we are especially asking you to publish this information. There are many sculpture experts in the country who know that they have the ability to create likenesses based on a sample. We respectfully hope to be informed so that we can go to the front and ask them to sculpt statues of our deceased parents (about one foot tall). My brother and I can continue to serve our parents, as if we were still in a happy family environment. Then, we would be very grateful. We also tell those who have parents in the hall but do not know how to be filial that they should fulfill their filial duty as soon as possible to avoid regret. We earnestly submit this request, hoping that you will acknowledge our sincerity. Your brothers, Chen Zhide, Fubomin, respectfully. (Address: Anlu 54)</p>
<h3>Responding to Readers</h3>
<p>Wang Jinggao asks: I am 26 years old. Every spring, numerous blisters develop around the soles of my feet, some containing pus. They are extremely itchy, and when scratched, they ulcerate, appearing and disappearing. They only heal after mid-autumn, causing great pain. I have sought treatment in many ways, but none have been able to cure the root cause. Is there any effective cure or preventative measure? Also, I have small sores on my arms and legs that ooze white water and gradually enlarge to the size of silver dollars. They do not penetrate deeply into the muscles, nor are they painful or itchy. Only the outer skin is broken, with a small amount of white water. Is there a way to cure the root cause?</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers: (A) Soak the affected area for fifteen minutes in a warm solution of potassium permanganate at a concentration of one part per thousand. Dry it, then apply 10% boric acid and nourishing powder three times a day. This may be effective. (B) The stubborn small sores on the arms and legs should be examined by drawing blood to determine if they are syphilitic. Then, decide how to treat them.</p>
<p>Wu Daquan asks: Due to inadequate care in my childhood, both of my eardrums are ruptured, and they are still draining pus. I constantly absorb it with cotton swabs, but it regenerates. Is there any way to stop the pus? Also, I have a lot of nasal mucus, which is worse on cold days, causing me great suffering. Is there any way to eliminate the mucus?</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers: (A) For pus in the ears, use 3% hydrogen peroxide to wash the ears, and apply anti-inflammatory medicinal powder. At the same time, take anti-inflammatory medicine tablets internally for a few days. (B) For excessive nasal mucus, instill a 1% ephedrine solution.</p>
