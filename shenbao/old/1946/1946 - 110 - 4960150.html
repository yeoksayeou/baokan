<h3>踏雪聽砲聲</h3>
<p>— 本報遼陽特約記者　關榮欽</p>
<p>三個星期的流蕩生活，吿一段落了，腦海裏老還晃動着各式各樣的景物·人影·和那曾經震德過心靈的砲聲。　是在三月九日的一個早晨，本來，聽說春天已降臨這麼久了，可是那皚皚的白雪，還是那麽頑强地固封着大地。在新民，祇有那或方或圓的烟囱，沒有全然失去原形，其他一切的一切，都穿着縞素的白衣，寒氣在橫衝直撞，明割暗刺，可是它還阻擋不住那本來躱在屋子裏烘爐子的人們，大大小小的站出門外來看着相處已一個多月的國軍出發，卡車，吉普車，馬車以及成羣成隊的武裝弟兄，匆忙地來去，本來已是狹窄的街頭，份外顯得緊湊了。</p>
<p>出了城，走的是一條公路，白雪蓋覆的那麼固密，要不是前面有人踐踏過，誰也不知通自已走的是一條公路，裝備重，白雪又在炫目，卡車。馬車或走路的人們，一不愼就陷進公路旁的溝坑衷。我坐的卡軍，就曾陷過一次，不過幾分鐘後又緩緩爬起來了。白皚皚的原野，除了疏落的枯萎草本在塞風中發抖打顫之外，其他點綴眞少，村落不易看到，從新民到大民屯凡四十里的長途，村落才看到三兩處。</p>
<p>大民屯是一個小鎭，成丁字形的街道兩旁，也有不少店舖，有些生意還相當大，我們住的是　所汕房，黃豆小丘似地堆積着，掌櫃的還說沒有豆，其規模可見。雖說是國土光復了，可是主人談話還是那麽鬱悒，他說因爲打仗，四鄕買賣不易做，來貨又少，共軍於月前會來過，小小的一個城鎭，就化了四五十萬的招待費，他的店子也出了三四千，這健談的掌櫃先生，睡在我的對面炕床，一入晚，他就邊對臘燭捫虱子，邊和我談過去十四年東北同胞的遭遇。他們吃的是高桀，是糠，是橡子麫——是畜類吃了也拉肚子的橡子麫，偶爾買斤把大米，買件把新布料，給鷹犬似的僞警特務察覺，就多方被恐嚇，對方要是「原諒」你的話，「沒收充公」，放你走，要是不「原諒」你的話（通常是在萬目睽睽的塲合），就拖你進警察所，按經濟犯治罪，苦是誰也得受的，惟有這班鷹犬例外之本身腦滿腸肥，妻兒也肚飽身亮，實際上，與其說是此輩鷹犬的可惡，無寗說是商人牽拉利用的成功。</p>
<p>從大民屯到遼陽途中，我曾在不下十處的村鎮中止息過，有時踏着雪，有時踏着冰溶雪解後滿是泥濘的田野，這樣的漿路載着重重的車輛滾動固難，指着重荷的弟兄走來更加吃力萬分。一對對的毛鞋給厚厚的淤泥裏包着，看來比他們的雙腿還要笨重。有幾位弟兄，鞋走破了，只穿着補綴過多次的毛襪在泥淖里趦趄着，前而要是沒有戰事，走來還好，有時前而砲聲，槍聲響了，走起路來就脚重心更重，槍砲聲響的結果，是鮮紅的血，在渾河南岸的摸十里處的李大人村，我看見幾位躺在担架上的國軍官兵，聽說是數小時前受傷的，也是在李大人村，我還看見十多位躺在一家農家門前和走廊中的八路軍弟兄，幾個已經死去，另幾個則受重傷，死的靜默地躺着，有的屈彎着身軀，躺在木板上或高梁莖上，有些直條條地躺在地上，傷的也躺在一處，不是枕着高梁莖，就是枕着破棉軍服，共中有一個是枕在他那已死去的同伴的上腿部，紅中帶赭的血液，滲透過那厚厚的黃棉軍服，我想拍照，怔抖的手，使我未如所願。一位腿部受傷，全身發抖的弟兄，眼巴巴地望着我，像有千言萬語要訴陳，我就走近和他說話，我問他如何參加八路，他說是在火車站附近被拉來的，入伍後的幾個月中，曾開過兩次小差，都沒有成功。他含淚告訴我，他的哥哥還在中央軍中，看他那痙孿痛苦的臉面，我咒詛任何人也來不及。</p>
<p>最是震耳憾心的一次砲聲，是在李大人村南七八里處的東廣山屯，大皇屯一帶，「砰砰　　」足足響了兩點鐘，這兩小時中，我坐不是，站不是，只有在冰凍了的河溪上徘徊。一位姓蔣的國軍軍官吿訴我，這附近一帶的八路，本來早就垮了，可是數天前從某方運到兩百尊砲，才得繼續支持下去，他的消息是從不知兵事的村民口中得來的，可靠與否，我不知道。</p>
<p>砲聲響處，國軍共軍都忙，百姓又忙又怕。有兩處小村莊的村民吿訴我，男子都被八路要去抬傷兵去了。婦女小孩，都噤若寒蟬，怔慄地潛伏着，無辜的小孩，失了學固不在話下，還日夕受到恐怖的威脅。與軍隊聯結最密切的是馬車伕，不但運輜重行李需馬車，連載傷官傷兵也需馬車，在大皇屯附近負傷的共軍旅長楊樹元，就是用馬車（兩個腸輪子托着一塊厚木板的車輛，當地百姓多叫板車）運送到後方的，幾位給八路運輸行李輜重的馬車伕吿訴我，他們給八路工作沒有報酬，要不是强迫，誰也不願意去，給國軍工作的馬車伕，一天一百元，另受軍方供人糧馬糧，熱騰騰的大米飯，他們在過新年時也不易吃到，跟着國軍居然吃到了。一位馬車伕說，他曾經給八路拉去抬担架，行軍時八路要他們走在前頭，砲響時八路都彎着腰或臥倒地上匍匐是，在他們前頭走的百姓担架隊，卻依然被迫昂首向前。担架隊走在部隊的前面，打起來又不准低首彎腰，我不知道是什麼戰術，大抵是「人堆戰術」的另一種使用吧？</p>
<p>此間八路大多自稱曰：「人民自治軍」，與「」北滿北「民主聯軍」一樣的耐人尋味，八路住過的村鎮，你總會看到一大堆用白灰寫的標語，他們愛用自已杜撰的減筆字，「擁護」寫成「抓　」，像「拥护東北人民自治政府」，「拥护東北人民自治軍維持地方治安」，「拥护蔣主席四項諾言」（他們是這麼巧妙的）之類，實際上，八路與東北同胞關係也確乎相當密切，第一，抽丁（百姓說是「要八路」），一處村鎭數人至十數人，抽不出惟村鎭長是問，第二，送糧，一畝田得送高梁米二十八斤，沒有的你也得自行設法，第三，最妙，「取富濟貧」，每到一地，就調查當地富有之家，列上黑名單，穀米多的，就拿出來「分」給貧民，頗能得一些貧民的同意，和誘致一些失業工人和走頭無路的僞警的參與，雖然，當他們離開時，村民眼巴巴釘着運走一袋袋的大米白麵，他們也不管了有錢或有不動產之家，通常會被人戴上某種罪名的帽子，繳款數萬至數十萬。在遼陽北十里處的大紙房，三百多戶的小村鎭上，黑名單的富戶有五十八家，最多的一家出十二萬，說來也巧，繳款前夕，國軍到了。爲着要錢，我聽過兩幕劇：瀋陽以西三十多里的沙岑堡，有一位年上六十的老者，被過路的八路拉了去，二十多天了，一直沒有下文，老者的姪子吿訴我，要是當初八萬元的贖身款籌揩得起，就沒有這不幸的遭遇了。遼陽城洪旭如醫院院長洪旭如，被八路加上購買南滿醫院藥品的罪名，索款五十萬元，這本來不是富有的醫生，聽到這龐大的數字就暈厥過去，醒後對八路代表說，將以所住房屋出賣，賣到多少算多少，空間這橫來的刺激過大，不數天洪醫生就死去了，八路已撤出遼陽了，遼市各界前天舉行一個盛大的歡迎國軍大會，開會前，印發歡迎辭，中間有幾句話是這樣：「他償滿口唱着為國為民的高調調，欺騙民衆，但狐狸尾巴是難得掩飾的，日子久了真偽畢露，今日傳張，明日綁李，老是伸出那卑汚的手向百姓要錢，他們的行為比綁票的土匪還卑鄙無恥，他們給百姓的痛苦，比起日寇佔領期間更深，命定該受活罪的我們，過了十四年的奴隸生活，還得忍受橫征暴歛，強取豪奪的八路匪洗刦。」有一位七十一歲的老者，在擠得水洩不通的歡迎會中，於各團體代表熱烈地致詞後，就走到講台前，展開一封信，對着受歡迎的新六軍龍天武師長誦讀，讀完了就遞給龍將軍，那封信來了一段是這樣寫的「…並祈師長轉達東北人民對蔣主席收復國土，還我自由之無量功德，永矢弗志」。老人念完了，一些小學生也把他們携來的慰勞信，一封封向龍將軍呈遞並鞠躬，同學這個榮耀的還有新少二師羅英團長。</p>
<p>八路據遼陽已過半年了，市民說，他們來過三批；第一批給第二批打走，第二批又給第三批打走，第三批一連住了三個月，直至新六軍進駐前方才撤退。</p>
<p>節近淸明的遼陽，一天天在轉暖，近郊的白雪已漸漸失去跡痕，窗外偶爾傳來幾聲春電，初聽有點像遠處傳來的砲聲，遼陽同胞沒有受驚躱起來，他們在街頭，路邊集結着，等着看幾個投誠國軍的八路弟兄走過。</p>

<h3>為東北同胞請命！　——請共黨不要在東北再埋下大地雷——</h3>
<p>馬歇爾特使返任抵渝的時候，正是中共所謂「民主聯軍」加緊攻襲長春的時候。長哈電報昨已不通，昨晚且傳共軍攻佔長春，迫在眉睫。高唱「民主，和平，團結，統一」的中國共產黨，在蘇軍方撤離長春的一小時內，就開始圍攻長春，顯然要用武力來霸佔東北，與政協會議的精神背道而馳。而共軍所用以攻擊的武器，乃是敵寇投降所繳的武器，共軍攻擊的同時又有蘇軍飛機低飛長春上空，彷彿巡視一般，柬北局勢的國際性已漸爲戰鬥的烟火所籠罩。據東北保安司令長官杜聿明將軍的談話，共軍攻入長春，政府在長春僅有保安隊二三千人，只能據守角角落，作自衛之抵抗，共軍的五十萬人，擁有谷種輕重武器，如何從日軍轉移至共軍手中，則不知其詳。從社將軍的談話，可知東北人民今天所以於勝利之後重遭砲火，國軍所以不能依照中蘇友好盟約接收主權，其癥結全在於共軍蓄意割據東北，爲未來的世界和平埋下一顆大地雷！</p>
<p>東北局勢之發展，所以有今天的情况，我們還得率直指出，其重要關鍵是在於國際關係。日本投降以後，整個東北即在蘇軍控制統治之下。中蘇友好條約，一方面爲中蘇關係開一新頁，一方面也爲東北的局勢定下一個軌範。依據中蘇友好條約精神，駐在東北的蘇軍應將整個東北移交中國國民政府接管。中國政府爲恢復國土接管東北，派軍前往，原爲順理成章之事。不料共間阻礙重重，東北海口旣不能利用，只好循秦皇島沿北寗鐵路推進，而在同時期內所謂共軍郤可自熱河開入，或自山東半島渡海，源源在旅大營口一帶登陸。如果東北沒有這些不奉中央軍令的部隊，就不會有今天的砲火。國軍開往東北，是根據中蘇盟約；共軍開入，有何必要？蘇軍對此，何以不爲有效的制止？蘇軍有依的協助中國國民政府接收東北的義務，何竟放任共軍先入東北，以致演成今日的局面？現在東北的火藥氣味愈濃，我們中國老百姓愈不能不體認其間國際關係的所在。我們在今天依然虔誠的祈禱，東北不要再成爲國際的火藥庫。然而共黨別其心腸，偏把「好肉挖做瘡」，硬要在東北同胞十四年茹辛含苦而後方始回到祖國懷抱的土地上，再塊下一顆大地雷！</p>
<p>馬歇爾元帥蒞華的使命，是要協助中國覓取和平統一的途徑，間接也就是爲世界至少爲遠東消除將來國際間的火種。然而今天東北這種局勢，正是一反馬歇爾元帥努力的鵠的。從馬歇爾元帥蒞任來華到現在爲止，中國的執政當局以及其它各黨各派，包括共產黨在內，都口口聲聲主張以政治方法來解決當前的國內局勢，這與杜魯門總統之主張有一個强固統一而民主的中國不謀而合。故自馬帥蒞任以來，我們看見有「政協」的圓滿進行，有軍事調處執行小組的派遣，有改組國民政府與召開國民大會的準備，凡此努力，都在促使中國的局勢得以安定，統一民主得以實現。乃當局勢漸趨好轉之際，除各地的零星戰鬥共軍還是時時發動外，他們且在東北大規模進襲長春，阻撓國軍的接收。時至今日，如果國內外還不分一個是非，只知道呼籲停戰，而不明白指出那一方面須負破壞「政協」以來協調精神的責任，那末，今日出現在東北的戰鬥行爲，安知明大不出在於華北，又安知後天不出現於華中？因爲共黨就利用大家「無是非」的糊塗心理，先來造成劃據地盤的事實，然後再來講價還價請求調處，試問國家還成什麽國家，軍隊還成什麽軍隊？我們老實說，長此下去，不但馬歇爾特使將上了一個大當，美國盟友將受了中共的欺騙，中國全國人民也必終有一天要吃共黨埋下地雷的大苦頭。</p>
<p>我們很覺得慚愧在現在這種局勢，我們的同胞還不能以民族利益爲上，不顧盟邦調處的一番美意，甘願作傀儡，做出這些禍國殃民的事來。但這不是一件僅僅慚愧所能解決的事。馬歇爾元帥旣然回華返任，對於東北局勢自極關注，正如中國人民一樣，不願東北再埋下地霄，不願東北再成爲國際的火藥庫。東北的局勢，不僅關係中國的安危治亂，抑且有關整個世界的和平。現在明明是有人在東北玩火，我們應迅將這火種予以撲滅。明明是有人在東北埋地雷，我們應迅將這地雷發掘。中國人民對於目今東北的局勢，有如下的一般認識：（一）柬北爲中國領土的一部，本領土主權與行政完整之原則，東北決不容有任何形式的分割。（二）爲維護中國領土及主權的完整，國軍的接收工作不容有任何阻撓。（三）一切對束北局勢分化及二元化的企圖，絕對不爲眞正中國老百姓所承認。因此，共軍在東北的活動均違反中國人民的共同心理。爲解決目前的局勢計，我們主張：（1）軍事調處執行小組應迅即趕赴東北，嚴厲制止共軍的進襲；（2）關於東北的接收，應由國軍完成其所負任務，共軍不得阻擾，（3）所有在東北的國軍與共軍，應依照整編，與統編方案靜待處理，那一方還約，就解散那一方面的部隊。</p>
<p>這是一個最起碼的解決途徑。爲了顧全事實，許多法理上的大道理不必談了。我們應迅速消滅這種表面上似是而非的「內爭」形勢。我們應以消防隊員救火的精神，迅即撲滅東北這個火種，迅即掘去東北這個地雷。我們向中共再作一度誠摯的呼籲，我們再爲東北同胞請命！</p>

<h3>安理會討論西班牙問題　一場爭辯無結果　澳代表建議派小組委員會赴西調查　大會休會至下週二再開</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十九日廣播：聯合國機構安全理事會下星期二開會，對專家委員會審查伊朗問題之報吿，將首先予以討論。至於西班牙問題，亦將由安理會指派小組委會硏究弗朗哥是否威脅世界和平後，再行討論。</p>
<p>安全理事會十八日晚開會討論伊朗與西班牙問題，仍無結果，在蘇聯代表葛羅米柯請求之下，決定下週二再行舉行會議，屆時伊朗問題，將提出討論。</p>
<p>當討論西班氏問題時，一時唇槍舌劍，引起熱烈辯論。英代表賈德幹指責討論西班牙弗朗哥政權存在問題，不啻干涉西班牙內政，蘇代表葛羅米柯則支持波蘭對弗朗哥斷絕外交關係之提案，並稱：整個問題可以一言蔽之，即「法西斯黨掀起戰爭六年於茲其間血流成渠，屍積成山，然則法西斯主義尙能容其存在乎？」</p>
<p>澳大利亞代表霍琪遜曾提出妥洽建議，已獲各代表擁護。霍氏係建議修改波蘭就西班牙提出之動議，主張派定五人組成小組委員會，調查西班牙問題，於五月十七日以前向安全理事會復命，多數代表難未說明是否贊助，惟一般均表示興趣，且謂此議頗有接受可能。</p>
<p>據聯記者向安全理事會代表作非正式測騐，僅墨西哥，法國及蘇聯贊成波蘭提議，與西班牙弗朗哥政府斷絕國交蘇代表葛羅米柯曾宣言此項提義值得考慮，英奧荷蘭均表示反對。美仍待波蘭證明控案再行決定，巴西·中國·埃及·澳洲尙未表示態度。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十八日電〕聯合國安全理事會議事規則專家委員會今日提出報告，對於伊朗問題當事雙方旣申請撤消，在法理上是否仍應留在議議程，意見未能一致，故該問題將於下星期二退回安全理事會重加討論。</p>
<p>英代表反對集體對西絕交</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十八日電〕英代表賈德幹今日在安全理事會宣稱：予不能承認西班牙政府威脅和平，破壞和平，或有侵略行動之案今已成立，因此對現在即請與西班牙政府休體絕父，不能認爲正當。英駐西火使館於一月間報吿，所稱德國科學家在西班牙從事新戰術之科學硏究，並無佐證，迄今亦未獲得證實此項傳說之情報。英國官方報吿，德國所有言方與多數半可方面之資產，均已移交西班牙政府或聯合國駐馬德里代表團，現在西班牙之德人約一萬至一萬二千名，多數以私人資格　　，官吏，間諜及國社黨人之被發見應予遣送回國者僅約二千五百人。前德國軍人之在西班牙者僅一百五十名左右。關於國社黨領袖避匿西班牙一節，英國未獲情報。</p>
<p>斯退丁紐斯重申美國立場</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十八日電〕美代表斯退丁紐斯即席重申美國之立塲，略謂：美國所採立塲，已一再表明，故總統羅斯福曾於一年以前致函美國駐西班牙大使，鄭重聲明美國對於弗朗哥政權與軸心國聯絡）事，不能贊同，但車申對西班牙人民之偉大友誼。同時，吾人樂於擁擁舊金山會議及波茨坦會議決議，認爲西班牙現政權一日存在，該國一日不得成為聯合國之一員，此種事實乃衆所週知。總之，任何行動，凡與聯合國憲章相符，或任何獨立的國內行動，能以合理方式達成此次目標，藉以消滅弗朗哥政權，恢復民主政權而不發生內戰者，美國予以同情的考慮。</p>
<p>郭泰祺指陳我未承認四國</p>
<p>中國代表郭泰祺發言，對西班牙人民表示同情，並希望該國即將加入聯合國爲會員。關於波蘭代表要求對西班牙絕交一層。郭氏指出中國從未承認該一政權，故根本無外交關係存在，但安全理事會在確切證明西班牙現政權構成國際安全之威脅以前，不應有所行動云。</p>
<h3>安理會新主席不孚眾望　會場秩序混亂</h3>

<h3>市衛生局推進防疫運動　本市天花患者已見減少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市天花患者，由於氣候轉暖，及市衛生局積極預防，本月份已見減少。上月份患者，經市立醫院方面統計，共一七九人，本月份迄十七日止，爲七五人。</p>
<p>該局鑒於夏季日近，防疫工作極爲重要，已由防疫處擬具夏令訪疫工作計劃，呈請市府當局核准，一經批准後，立即指撥經費，開始推進工作。其計劃大要可分四點：（一）整理土井，以免蟲類繁殖。市區內各幷均將塡平，郊區土井，擬派員實地調查檢驗，除屬必需者外，亦應塡平。凡能接通自來水處，將請求自來水公司接管，吾則決督導居民整理水井，維持淸潔。（二）注射防疫針，該局已積極製造防疫疫苗，預定可供四百萬人之用，將於五月一日開始，爲市民服務。（三）酒射DDDT。DDT之主要用途乃殺滅昆蟲類如蝨·蚊·蠅·等，粉劑對滅蝨具特效。每一夸脫之百分之五DDT溶液，可應用於二五〇平方呎而積上，持久效力達二三個月。各界如需消滅蚊蟲，可向市衛生局申請。但該局因收到DDT數量極少，目前尙不能大量供應，正再度請求善後救濟總署撥給。對郊區河浜散放DDT，現該局擬先予局部試騐，因DDT含有毒素，鄕民飲水洗菜，均取給於河浜，不無危險，故於流動浜中不擬洒放。（四）向市民宣傳衛生常織，務期市民切勿飲食生水生菜，街頭攤販菜食尤忌購食。該局將請求警察局社會局，會同取締夏季生菓攤。</p>
<h3>電車公共汽車今日起加價　主管當局發表加價理由　公司虧累奇重應予補救</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市電車及公共汽車，定今日（二十日）起調整便格：電車頭等最低九十元，最高二百元。三等最低六十元，最高一百二十元。公共汽車最低一百元，最高三百元。據市公用局主管當局稱，本市公共車輛票價，均依照各公司必要支出，爲核定之標準。職工工資旣已依照生活指數迭次增加，行車成本自亦隨之遽加。又因材料飛漲，輛損壞，無法修理，尤以車胎一項，無力購買，致行駛車輛减少。如英商原有無軌電車一三〇輛，現祗行駛四二輛。現英商電車公司累虧達九萬六千萬元；法商積虧七萬八千七百萬元，故非迅予補救不可。局方為顧及市內行政機關工務人員及學校員生减省乘車費用起見，特責成各公司，於五月起發售電車半價月季票，以示優待。</p>
<p>火車尙未漲價</p>
<p>兩路管理局運務處胡副處長昨語華東社記者云：外傳火車票即將增加四倍，係根據本局新增滬杭特別快車之票價而誤傳。本局鑒於復活節屆臨，爲便利各機關團體起見，特於昨日起地開滬杭綫特別快車一列，此列車僅限頭二等旅客乘坐，每日淸晨六時四十分由北站開出。爲避免擁擠起見，票價較其他特別快車高四倍，幷須憑票對號入座，以示限制。此項票價係暫時性質，將於四月廿二日後仍减爲原價。至於兩路票價普遍增價事，本局尙未獲得交通部之增加票價命令云。</p>
<p>限制裝制電話</p>
<p>本市公用局，現因上海電話公司材料缺乏，各局機件旣多滿額，各區綫路亦無空餘。而向該公司申請裝置者，接踵而來，該公司難於應付。今後爲配合我國政府復員，並適應軍政機關之緊急需要，對於裝置電話，不得不加以限制。妥經規定上海電話公司裝置電話臨時限制辦法，於本月十五日起實施，聞該辦法內規定，向上海電話公司申請裝置電話者，以我國軍政航空機關。外國使領館。軍事航空機關。國營工商機構及公用事業等，而共電話需要，為公共服務所必需，且具有緊急性質者爲限。並聞各該機關須出具正式公函，由最高長官簽署，方可向上海電話公司直接申請云。</p>

<h3>首屆滬市參議員選舉期近　選民莫放棄權利</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　蒼龍</p>
<p>為民主播種</p>
<p>在「民主」呼聲響澈雲霄的今天，本市將在四月廿八日選舉第一屆市參議員，不能不說是有其隆重的涵義。可是從各方面看來，這次選舉準備的時間，比較上是太侷促些。同時，市民對市參議會和競選市參議員的重要性，也還缺少認識。記者想把所搜集到有關這方面的資料，簡略地介紹一下：</p>
<p>參會職權與市相關聯</p>
<p>第一步，我們不妨先認識一下市參該會的職權。據市參議會組織條例第二條規定：要議決（一）完成地方自治各事項，（二）市單行規章事項，（三）市預算書審核市決算，（四）市稅公債及其他增加市庫負担，（五）市有財產之經營及處分，（六）市長交議事項。此外還可建議市政興革事項，聽取市政府施政報吿及向市政府提出質詢事項，接受市民請願事項，以及其他法律賦與之事項。換言之，市參議會爲全市人民的代表機關，照以上職掌的十項任務看來，可說沒有一項不與市民本身利益息息相關，我們旣不容本身的利益遭受損害，我們必須出全力來競選足以代表市民利益的市參議員！</p>
<p>選民登記實同鳳毛麟角</p>
<p>有人說，在敵偽盤踞期的黑暗時代，好的人材都隱避起來。那末，現在天日重光，苦守了八個年頭，該是挺身而出爲民服務的千載良機。可是，據說有許多區保裹的市民，被選任職務後，常有推卸不就的意向。而這次聲請爲公職候選人檢　資格者，不過一千餘人。還有選民的登記，原則上凡實足年齡在二十歲以上而持有國民身份證或領取國民身份證收據的，都可向所屬各保辦事處就近登記，以　取得選民的資格。而事實上眞能自赴各保辦事處登記的，實同鳳毛麟角。所以臨時變通辦法，由民政處將選舉人名簿發交各保辦事處，代爲編造選舉人登記名册。這樣可使本市具有選民資格的市民（據估計有二百零四萬左右），都能及時參加選舉。</p>
<p>選舉名額規定產生標準</p>
<p>本市市參議員區域選舉的名額，是依照市參議員組織法第四條規定，所選基本數十九名，超過十萬人口，每三萬人加一名。照本年二月份本市戶口淸查統計人口總數是三·三四五·八七五人，應該是一〇八名，所以區域選舉合計的名額是一二七名。本市現在共分三十二個區域，其中二十七及二十八兩區尙未劃定，三十二區暫緩舉行選舉，此外各選舉區名額的分配，是依照市參議選舉條例第九條規定，按照比例產生的。那就是說，凡滿人口二·三四五名者，產生一人。餘數照各選舉區零數的多寡，將餘額依次歸零數較多之區。這樣分配下來，泰山區以人口最多，分配到十三名，新成區次多，分配到十名，其他依此類推。至於職業團體應選出的市參議員名額，照規定是佔全數參議員名額的十分之三。那末一二七名的十分之三，是五十四名：所以本市的參議員總名額，合共是一八一名。各選舉區的參議員，由各區所屬選民直接投票選舉產生，各職業團體則須視其所屬會員單位的多少，而定其選舉制度。例如漁會敎育會的選舉，採直接選舉制；由會員直接選舉，商會。工會。農會和自由職業團體，因所屬會員單位較多，採取複選制，先由每一單位選出三人爲初選人，再會同複選之。</p>
<p>公職競選不感多大興趣</p>
<p>我們不妨再一試觀公職候選人資格的規定，所謂公職候選人，可分甲乙二種，均須經過考試。經甲種公職候選人考試及格者，得為市參議員及區長副區長候選人，經乙種公職候選人考試及格者，得爲區民代表及保長副保長候選人。考試方法，分試騐與檢　兩種，檢　只繳騐證件，審查資歷，几經檢　及格的，就取得候選資格，不必再應試騐。現在本市先辦檢　，而由市政府組織本市公職候選人資格檢　委員會檢　之。甲乙兩種公職候選人聲請檢毅者，均須爲二十五歲的市民。現在除乙種資格規定，因較普遍不談外，先就甲種資格而論，照規定須具有下列資格之一，即：（一）曾任縣參議者，（二）曾任鄕鎭民代表或鄕鎭長二年以上者，（三）有委任職之任用資格者，（四）有普遍考試資格並有社會服務經歷三年以上者，（五）經自治訓練及格並有社會服務經歷三年以上者，（六）曾辦理地方公益事務三年以上者，（七）曾任職業團體或其他人民團體主要職務三年以上者，（八）曾從事自由職業三年以上者。試問以本市三百三十餘萬人口之衆，能以上述資格之一，而擊請爲甲種公職候選人者，難道僅有見諸報端的一千餘人麼？這又是本市市民對競選缺少興趣的一個有力佐證。</p>
<p>發揚民主一個有力測騐</p>
<p>現在聲請爲公職候選人登記的日期已經截止，我們旣放棄爲公職候選人的資格於先，却絕不能再放棄選民的權利於後，因爲選舉權是人民基本的權利，試看這次大戰以後，那一個現代的國家，那一個前進的民族，不熊熊地燃起民主的火炬。現在政府旣決心實施普選，就是爲實施眞正民主，實施還政於民的方針而播下一顆種子，而舉一起一枝火炬。這種子能吾茁壯滋一長，這火炬能吾發揮光芒，上海一市市參議員的這次選舉，是一個最有力的測騐！</p>
<h3>清明時節·微園一角　訪胡木蘭小組</h3>
<p>— 十日重慶航訊　本報特約記者趙浩生寄</p>
<p>淸明時節，重慶有着使人禁不住要從心底爆出歡笑來的好天氣。連續開了半月的參政會剛剛閉幕，精神上感到無限輕快，利用着道難得的淸閒時間，記者作了一次全無惱人的「政治性」的愉快訪問。</p>
<p>本來，在參政會開會的半個月中，在會塲裏，汽車上就常常見到胡參政員的，然而每次都是匆匆忙忙，沒有可以從容談話的時間。會完了，胡參政員也比較淸閑，記者就在閉幕後的第二天—三月四號，洽是淸明節，作一次專誠的拜訪。</p>
<p>胡木蘭小姐！從此處起，我要用這個稱呼了—參政會中的各位參政員們，都是這樣稱呼着她。「胡小姐」，似乎包含着比「胡參政負」更多的意義，因此「胡小姐」是比「胡參政員」的稱呼更響亮些。</p>
<p>樸素淡雅</p>
<p>胡小姐重慶的寓所，是在川東師範街。門楣木牌上，寫着淡淡的兩個字「微園」。</p>
<p>走進竹門，是一個建築在山陂下的院落，像重慶的許多「園」一樣，裏面是一座座互不相連的房子，各個人家分住，周圍用竹籬圈起來，成一個總的名稱「×園」，這是重慶中上層人家很普遍的住宅形式。</p>
<p>胡小姐的家，是一所四方形的平房，門前，有着緣色的花架，牽牛花的弱枝，才從地上嬝嬝伸起，在盛夏季節，花架上也許可能有着蓬叢的華蓋，門前，一塊三合土的平地，一條毛足光潔的小黑狗，正躺在那裏晒太陽，環顧周遭，是一片寧靜氣象，這與記者想像中的胡公館，是有着更多樸素淡雅的風味。</p>
<p>準備先回廣州去　諸事待理</p>
<p>正如大家所聽說，胡小姐愛穿單色的衣着一樣，那天她是一身全黑的裝束，一件黑旗袍，一雙繡花的黑緞鞋，素雅而家常，她滿面歡喜的和記者招呼，第一句話，是爲參政會的閉幕而互道辛苦，然後用廣東話招呼着走出來的侍女：「斟唔茶！」</p>
<p>胡小姐的普通話講得很好，她的談話平實，親切，絕沒有「婦女運動家」的神氣，記者首先問：參政會閉幕了，胡小姐預備甚麽時候走？回廣州還是到上海或南京？她說走，恐怕還得一兩個禮拜，她要先回廣州，然後再到上海和南京看看。當記者提到如果照參政會的提示，國大代表增加，恐怕胡小姐一定要在五月五號以前趕到南京時，她笑了。她說增加國大代表的事情，自前還沒有決定，而她在廣州却有許多事情需要料理。</p>
<p>談到廣州，記者想起大家所最關心的，胡展堂先生基園的刧後情况。關於這件事，胡小姐也正有着很多話要說，於是，端起了侍女遞上來的一杯紅茶，開始來傾聽胡小姐的叙述了。</p>
<p>胡小姐說展堂先生的墓園，在廣州城外的龍眼洞，是抗戰開始的那年動工修建，後來因爲怕敵人當作軍事目標轟炸而中輟，爲了更詳細的說明墓園情况，胡小姐走回臥室拿出了兩本大厚册子，那是展堂先生墓園建築的全部計劃。</p>
<p>揭開基泰建築公司所作「胡故主席墓園工程計劃』的第一頁，是一張墓國計劃全景的鳥瞰圖，胡小姐指點講述得極其詳盡。</p>
<p>探望展堂先生墓籌劃復工</p>
<p>抗戰八年來，胡小姐從廣州到香港，到桂林，到重慶，無時不在懷念着墓園的安全，所以勝利後，她第一件事，就是趕回廣州，「看望爸爸的墓圍」。</p>
<p>這次胡小姐是從廣州來，除了出席參政會外，並且爲重修墓園事向政府有所請示。在八年的轉徙中，所幸當時全部的工程計劃尙在，一切有舊規可循，胡小姐已經同宋院長談過，就可以照原來計劃復工了。</p>
<p>胡小姐所保存的工程計劃有兩份，是由基泰建築公司經過三個月的勘測作成。二十六年一月，中樞審查通過。同年六月開工，跟着就是「七七」事變發生，這個在國家具有紀念性的工程，因國家的抗戰而中輟，在戰爭勝利後，又將復工了，實在是更加重了她的崇隆意義。</p>
<p>胡小姐返粵後，就要開始籌備復工的事情。數月前，張發奎將軍命令在廣州的日俘作工，已將墓園的土方修復了。</p>
<p>提及胡夫人靈柩黯然神傷</p>
<p>記者問起關於胡夫人的事情，這引起了胡小姐對八年抗戰中轉徙生活慨嘆的回憶。胡夫人是二十五年在渝逝世，這是她八年生活中一件最凄傷的記憶。胡夫人的靈柩，勝利後已經由公路移返廣州。此外，展堂先生的遺物手稿等，由於胡小姐的珍愛保存，在八年的轉徙中絲毫沒有失散，現在也運回廣州。國寳無恙，這實在不僅是胡小姐一個人的歡喜！</p>
<p>由於胡小組極家常的談話，記者問起更多的關於胡小姐的家事，這也正是全國人所至極關心的事。展堂先生的兄弟很多，嫡親的　愛，只有胡小姐一個人。展堂先生生前一切活動，都是携帶着他唯一的愛女，展堂先生的革命生活，是與他的愛女密切相連。展堂先生在歷史上的功蹟，也是這唯一的愛女帮同寫成的。展堂先生丟世後，胡小姐並沒有中斷她的政治生活。胡夫人去世後，胡小姐獨自生活得更英挺。這一切，可以從胡小姐的待人與談話上，很淸楚的看得出來的。</p>
<p>胡公館或將變賣語含幽默</p>
<p>長約兩個鐘頭的訪問，最後把談話又落在甚麽時候離開重慶的問題上。這次是胡小姐問記者要到哪見去了。記者吿訴她準備二十號左右到上海，她說起他對申報的記憶，於是記者請她贈給本報一張最近的照片，並請她在一張名片上簽名，她都慨然允許了。</p>
<p>靠辭出來，在花架下，記者問胡小姐這所房子是租的還是自已建築的？她說是從桂林到重慶來以後蓋的，現在計劃着要賣掉了。接着，她又幽默的加上一句：「這次走，大槪是不會再回來了。」</p>
<p>她很客氣的送記者到門口，在互這「上海見！」聲中，步出「微園」。</p>
<p>胡佛籌劃救濟世界飢荒</p>
<p>前美繼統及第一次世界大戰糧政管理官胡佛（左），與農業部長安德遜（中），及飢荒救濟委員會主席戴維斯（右），在美京就糧食問題舉行會談。杜魯門總統特派胡佛組織委員會，節减國內糧食，救濟歐洲及遠東在戰爭中受難的飢民。胡佛將赴歐洲及遠東視察飢荒的情形。</p>
<h3>滬市府訂定選民注意事項</h3>
<p>本市參議員選舉日期漸已迫近，市政府民政處爲擴大宣傳，以期全市民衆，踴躍參加起見，特印就各種顏色之小標語。「舉樅是人民基本權利，不要放葉選舉參議員的權利」，等八條，以便散發各處，並擬與在滬航空當局商洽利用飛機散播。又另行通知全市電影院，置成幻燈標語，以廣宣傳。錢市長大鈞，民政處張處長曉崧，及社會名流將廣播演說，闡述選舉意義，選舉道德，春關選及講述舉事項。市府民政處爲喚起市區民衆之注意，特定選舉日（本月廿八日）上午六時，施放長聲汽笛，並通知郊區工廠，亦於是時施放長聲汽笛，以喚醒郊區人民參加選舉云。</p>
<p>本市參議員選舉之區械選舉，係採普選制度，一般市民對於投票秩序，投票方法，皆未盡明瞭，易於錯誤，市政府民政處，特訂定參加區城選舉選民注意事項，以資選民遵循。</p>

<h3>救救廣西　桂北公路三百里無人煙　一千三百萬人嗷嗷待哺</h3>
<p>— 一日特約航訊　本報特約記者梁小中寄</p>
<p>提起筆來的時候，實在不禁一陣心酸，含着兩腔熱淚，記者要同胞也看一看這片廣西省的人間地獄！</p>
<p>災荒在廣西，沒有人提起的時候，彷彿一片平靜的幔幕，一揭開來，裏面完全是掙扎着最後的生命的奄奄一息的災黎，雜在死屍堆裏向着天乾哭，又望着天哀怨地死去。桂北從全縣到靈川三百公里的公路兩旁，人烟絕了跡，宜山到修仁一片高原地帶上，高速率的死亡，甚麽人能够不見而流淚，聞而腸斷？救命啊！救救幾百萬人的性命！起甚麽內戰？裝甚麽仁義？讓政府拿軍費去救一救不應該死的善良百姓啊！上帝！</p>
<p>大會戰年餘民間糧食搜刧一空</p>
<p>大災荒是這樣來的：淪陷時期，這裏曾經是大會戰的軍事據點，因此敵人經常有一兩個師團駐在這裏，歷時年餘，民間糧食早已搜括一空，再加上自衛隊的英勇抗戰，增加了敵人的仇視，因此更搜刼到寸草不留。及到反攻時期，大軍開桂，集結桂北，單精供應浩大，再加上一往一來的拉鋸戰，再加上可怕的旱災，再加上一塲瘟疫，於是，省境重光，桂北也就全光了。</p>
<p>糠粃製粑團結果喫一個死一個</p>
<p>流亡在大山的難民回到了故園，從第一踏入縣境的時候起，就開始與蕨根，葛根，土茯苓，禾蒿菜，剪刀菜，地菇，芭蕉根，棕樹頭野芋頭，草根，米糠這十一樣狗都不吃的東西結了緣，最初是挖着蕨根裏面的澱粉質充飢，後來運皮也拿來春成粉，雜以糠粃製成「耙團」，塞進肚子裏。唉，這那裏是人吃的東西？於是，吃一個，死一個，死到今天，也差不多了，甚至竟有鄕村外表還倒完整，進去則全村的人早呈死光跑光的慘象，曾經做過戰場的鄕村，今天能够賸下十分之四人口的百不得一，每天晨光未起，未死的人便結隊上山，採掘上述的食物，留下老弱和小孩子在家裏，等到採得野菜回家，一家數口早已死得僵硬的事情，時有所聞。</p>
<p>飢民臥敝絮　食枕中稻草以求生</p>
<p>再舉一些最普通的慘事，譬如全縣咸水車田村，有王姓男子，自斷食以後，動彈不得，臥於敞絮中，食枕頭裏的稻草充飢，結果依舊死掉。還有一件，黃沙河竹灣村，黃姓婦，有幼子兩人，因爲餓了兩天，沒有東西果腹，啼啼哭哭的要東西吃，那做母親的一時沒辦法，便用泥做成粑粑兩個，哄小孩子說：「放到火裏哄熟，就可以吃了。」兩個小孩子歡喜到不得了，一齊蹲在火盆旁，等泥粑耙熟，而他們的母親也就在泥粑粑還沒有熟的時候，自縊死了！泥粑粑永遠也不會熟啊！寫到這裹，記者再也忍不住眼淚！</p>
<p>到桂林請願　民眾包圍市長哭訴</p>
<p>靈川縣的民衆，到桂林請願，因爲桂林市長是靈川縣人，於是代表們就成天圍着蘇市長哭，要他想辦法。蘇市長一面嘆氣，一面對靈川的代表說：「你們苦，我知道，但是你們也看看桂林的人！」是的，桂林四郊每天都會發現三兩具死屍，挨盡了飢餓的，聽脫桂林會戰的時候死的人，身上有許多錢，於是搶着的去挖墳刨屍。死刑的威脅，在他們看來，實在太平常了，甚麽死法都是一樣的，能够活一天便算一天罷了。</p>
<p>苦了副署長</p>
<p>救濟分署的副署長謝貫一，和省府的合管處長魏競初，曾經視察過偌大的災區，而且帶回了兩個葛根雜糠粃製成的「粑團』，靑裏帶黑的顏色，又腥又具，聞了都要作嘔，難爲災胞們便拿這些東西果腹。唉，人間何世？同胞要受這些苦？這些「粑團』，謝副署長等都曾親自嚐過一口，但是馬上便吐了出來了。</p>
<p>田價儘管跌　但誰要這荒蕪土地</p>
<p>還有這樣悲苦的事情：因爲春天來了，蕨根都開始發芽，發了芽，連蕨也沒得吃了，難民要春天做甚麽？</p>
<p>災區裏，最初還有抺了良心的人放着空前的高利貸，一萬元到秋收時，除還本外，另外加兩担榖的利息。多少佃農，咬着牙關，借了下來，準備秋來剜肉補瘡。現在呢，連這樣的血錢也沒人肯借了，於是有田的人，一担榖一畝田也賣，半担榖一畝田也賣，但是，誰要這些荒蕪的土地？</p>
<p>兩千噸麵粉每人分配不到六兩</p>
<p>救濟的血淚呼聲，在四面微弱的呼叫着。救濟分署的副署長到達災區的時候，一個飢餓待斃的農民向副署長痴痴的望着，用手指指肚皮，眼淚像雨一樣橫流，隨着去看的人都哭了，接着那個農民也就靜靜地安息了。</p>
<p>二千噸的麵粉，已有小部分運抵桂林，但是廣西一千三百萬都是飢餓的人民，二千噸，每人領不到六兩，除了二千噸以外，甚麼都沒有了。我們要向救濟總署抗議，含着淚向救濟總署求救！</p>
<p>廣西人並沒有錯，他們不曾那鐵路，不會攻城池，不會裝門面，相反地却在多少次的戰爭中，賣盡了多少氣力，受盡了多少凄苦，今天竟然只換來一個空前的大死亡，大家的心裏價有說不出的寃抑，要接收人心，不要偏重，更不要簡直無動於中，爲了廣西的子弟也是中華的兒女骨肉，請伸手救一救廣西吧！（四月一日）</p>

<h3>平教員復課問題　正謀合理解決　教員堅主補發薪津</h3>
<p>〔大華社北平訊〕平全市立中小學敎員全體請假一事，發生迄今，已逾多日，市府雖謀合理解決，但因地方經費確實困難，必須向中央設法，故敎局英局長將此事發生情形，報吿熊市長，報吿要點，（一）敎員實無法生活，（二）平市敎育經費，歷年來均由中央補助，史有前例，（三）同一城內，中央機關待遇，何以相差數倍，（四）勤　純潔，（五）此爲最低之合理要求。熊氏即據以電吿中央，幷希敎師方面能大處着眼，以敎育前提，而先予復課。日前熊氏復乘市政會議之便，約請市黨部主任委員吳　人等出席討論解決辦法，結果分爲治標治本兩種辦法：治標辦法，係向善救總署要求，每人先配與麵粉一袋，治本辦法，由市府及敎局派員赴中央請示，必要時敎員方面亦派代表參加，要求三點：（一）增加底薪（二）公敎人員待遇平等，（三）確定平市敎育經費，希望從速復課。敎員會執監委以現在中小學所支薪津，若照中央標準，二三兩月份每人尙應補發五萬餘元，如當局能設法將此數發下，尙可考慮復課，四月份以後薪津，則請中央保證照所頒標準發放，如每人祇發麵粉一袋，則復課絕不可能云</p>

<h3>抗戰中成長起來的四川大學</h3>
<p>— 敬明</p>
<p>抗戰以前，四川敎育界的情形，正和四川的政治局面一樣混亂。高等敎育，除開敎會創辦的華西大學以外，其他在國內敎育界中，實在統不上有什麽地位。然而我們要知道，號稱天府之國的四川，有六千餘萬的人口，有豐富的農產和礦藏，正是我們抵抗帝國主義侵略的堪察加。　國民政府在日問的重重壓迫之下，認定不建設國防就無法制止侵略，不建設西南，就沒有國防可言，於是有二十三年的參謀團人川，有峨眉的軍官訓練，四川大學在這時候巳由合併師範大學·成都大學。公主四川大學及中國文學院等，於民國二十年成立，那時的校長是王兆榮先生，王校長在防區時代維持校務，雖然費苦心，大學的基礎還是十分脆弱，經不起任何風波。　參謀團人川的次年，四川的局面在劉甫城的領導之下完成了統一，中央決計進行開發，把灺建設爲國防的最後根據地，爲配合此種建設，人才的迫切需要給川大以發展的機會。這一年八月王校長辭職，中央商派國內名敎育家任鴻雋先生繼任，並將四川省立最學院，也歸併於川大之內。任校長可以說是川大的第二個大功臣，他高瞻遠囑，認定皇城在市區中心，不宜於辦學，便和四川省府定約，將皇城校址送與省府，而由省府指撥望江樓附近土地二千畝和川大交換，作爲新校址。這一計劃得到中央的熱烈支持，更由中央撥發國幣二百六十三萬元作爲建築新校舍專款，指派翁文灝·周貽春·廷黻·李濟·任鴻雋諸氏，組繼建築委員</p>
<p>到過成都的人都知道，望江樓是成都的風景區，　錦江把這一帶土地圈成一個半爲形。站在建築宏偉堅實的九眼獨頭，遠望帆船如　，垂楊夾道，綠樹白雲相映成趣，那裏有唐期名妓　　的遺跡，有琉璃瓦舖頂的望江樓，據當地熟悉掌故的人傳說，張獻忠亂蜀的時候，曾在濯錦江中埋藏白銀數億兩。</p>
<p>第一期校舍工程開工於廿六年七月，正是抗日戰事　發的前夕，巍巍高樓，在全國砲火瀰漫中，一座座興建起來。可惜校舍動工不久，任校畏使因故辭職，代理校務的是張頤先生，直到廿七年冬天中央纔派程天放先生前來接任。到廿八年春天，物價開始上漲建築工呈無形中陷人停頓狀態，又加敵機轟炸範國已深人成都，程校長爲避免無謂犧牲，決全在這一年夏天把學校遷到峨眉，此時已建築完成的校會有圖書館大樓一座，數理館化學館大樓各一座，學生宿舍修完屋完一座，舖好地基一座，精巧的敎授住宅完成五座，尙不及原來工程計劃的五分之一。（未完）</p>

<h3>實需投機雙管齊下　美鈔節上漲　最高到二千三百元　市場籌碼頗感缺乏</h3>
<p>美鈔在半實銷半投機之買戶推動下，節節聲高，籌碼奇缺，粥少僧多，連日進口貨　半屬於三月四日以範所訂約者，向中行申請，結款手續上並不全備，勢必向鈔市抵補，自晨開二〇八〇元起，一再向榮，午前曾見二二六〇元高價，而後略現恍惚，一度回小至二一八〇元光影，午刻平盤，午後美棉呢羢結款及投機雙管齊下，涸竭之鈔市，迫漲至二三〇〇元以上，而後稍平，結果較前收猛騰二百餘元，對黃金已軋　至七百尤對十兩，港票亦被帶好，老貨曾見四二〇元，面後稍定，結果較前收漲十七元，羅比升爲五二〇元，港電四二〇元，美匯掛牌仍平。</p>
<h3>在美鈔下　金價軋漲七萬</h3>
<p>艙赤昨受美鈔刺戰，漲風重起，晨開微挺，開後初時曾見疲軟，在一五四萬內外掙孔殊久，中行配給時尙乏明顯動靜，十一時左右始見俏利，美鈔有進無退，助長黃金買風，人心本因時局關係，潛伏向榮之勢，逐漸盤漲至中行配給價之上，（登記時間已過）見一六一萬高價。市勢至此始有某種當然壓力，漲勢不久即吿回落，午刻在一五六萬張徘徊，午後美鈔奇俏，金市亦被帶高至一六〇萬外，結果較前收上漲七萬，飾金掛脾十七萬六，紋銀一千五，銀元徵穩，暗拆平平，息價目一角二分至一角半不等。</p>
<h3>公債小有活動　華股頹勢未脫</h3>
<p>仁記路黑市被査禁</p>
<p>公價仍不公開，續有少數流動性之　受，除統丙外，雜牌仍乏動靜，統丙先升至五七〇〇元左右，而後曾回跌至五三〇〇元光景，最後在五三五〇元前後徘徊，結果較前收回跌一七〇元，華股昨警局巡視更厲，遠在仁紀路之百昌，亦遭當局査禁，頽勢已威，昨更怯疲，開後一度重振，永紗見五〇〇元，美亞四二〇〇元，景福四三三元，而後因瓊境不佳，轉趨頽勢，午刻遂呈低價，午收較前收永紗美亞跌半成以上，景福等三小熱跌一成弱，冷門及元老各股亦均下落，午後隔日交割喊價微高，外股續在塲外　受，各股成交價較前收稍高</p>
<h3>美棉暴漲　本市花交停頓　花商居奇扳價</h3>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電突然暴漲，四十四至五十磅苦，計近期美金二七，九四，遠期二七·九九，米特林現貨二八·四八，本埠現棉交易完全停頓，緣美棉潔風　戰，花商心思望高，執貨者大都居哥，扳價頗高，以致談判不易接近，紡建與民營紗廠均存觀望，全無成交，遂呈有行無市云。</p>
<h3>紗市已入盤局</h3>
<p>昨日紗市榮辱互見，大型廠貨同行有意求售，惜廣帮殊少納胃，故整馬小二萬，廿支　牌及十六支紗因內地帮授求有人，現貨不多，續好五千至一萬五千元之譜，目下紗市暫入盤旋之局，人心頗爲稱定，昨午又屆舫建公司開紗例期，八支及十支組紗略提高二萬，卅二支以上細紗小一萬至五萬，市上所需要之廿支大路貨，仍然供售。</p>
<h3>煤市疲滯</h3>
<p>煤市煙葉各貨，因煤　同業亦將有配給，且價格較　用煤尤廉，故趨勢依然不佳，人心較盧，價格　挫，由煤初承前　勢，續呈呆滯狀態，然因到貨仍湧，實銷亳無起見，是以復格再見盤小，柴炭目前市價與辦本已屬無利可屬，故一般客帮均　改當他秦，到貨平常，行情雖未見賡續下游，但市况仍爲渡軟，煤球自各機製煤球廠配得鴻基　來，現將開始裝運煤斤，即可恢復供應，聞大廠煤球廠盤內定問業批發爲十五六萬元，零售每擔九千元，品質較現市上各貨爲高，然市價亦較現爲高云。</p>
<h3>絲綢市況平穩</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲一二〇號大橋，晨開盤一百三十六萬元，做開一續後，即冉冉上升，迄午收　價做一百四十六萬元，下午做小四萬元，廠經價各檔較上日均略提升，惟交易俱寂靜，　貨美亞被面與上日相仿，大　務子　縐上午做三千三百五十元，下午略好，喊四百元，盛澤富晨公司三〇碼標準紡，在湖縐公所市塲發售，交易甚熱鬧。</p>
<h3>到源並未減少　米價大漲小回　當局決嚴懲投機活動</h3>
<p>昨日米市消化平常，粳米興小千元，秈米元米均小千餘元，收盤略見轉定之狀，麵粉因零化甚殷，續升二百元，油市以來貨仍旺，早市猛小，午時店方略取，漸漸回升，結局較昨小三五百元，豆餅亦然，農　午堅，價升百元，麩皮平平，黃豆亦漲五六百元，生仁帶軟，苞米貨稀，加五百元，據米市塲息，昨日本市計到白梗等六種，共六千餘石，其種類及石數如下：白粳三六四二石，杜秈九三〇石，羊秞三〇〇石，早稻九四四石，簿稻九六九石，白元二〇石。　又訊，滬市糧價，連日以來，每市石上漲約八千元，糧政特派員公署特派員前往米糧市塲調査眞象，據稱近日糧源並未减少，此次回漲主因，乃以投機者因見金鈔無陳可入，多改趨糧貪，以爲糧貸放出，糧商當必湧購，故乃爭進，以團持售而獲厚利，聞糧署據報後，除報部請示外，並與右　當局洽商，嚴懲此種投機，綜計目本月十二日以來，米糧來源並無顯著變化，而糧復竟上漲達百分之卅四張，其爲投機搗亂，甚爲顯然，茲將自十二日至十八日一週間之每日糧價及到米數列表如下：（米價以白粳爲例）</p>
<p>日期　米　價　到米（石）</p>
<p>十二　二六、〇〇〇　八、六七三</p>

<p>十七　三三、〇〇〇　六、三八四</p>
<p>十八　三三、五〇〇　六、三二二</p>
<p>又訊，　市長曾於昨日召集有關各方舉行會議，討論抑平米價取締投機辦法，據聞對於標本兼治，已有具體決定，嚴密調査已獲借款之米商，是否前往產地採購，同時爲便利運輸，商由兩路局加撥篷車，專供運米之用，對米市交易採監視辦法，如發現葉外人成業中人有抬價或收囤行爲者，決予嚴懲。</p>
<p>社會局亦於昨（十九）日下午三時，由吳局長開先在該局會議室召美市商會介紹之貸款糧商萬昌萬　林，新昌朱永明，三泰吳榮生，永順　益生，通成傅昌裕，協大亨馮鏞聲，乾鉬餘兪良濟，及荳米業同業公會介紹之貸款選商恒泰豐張超，萬昌寨楊順畬，協昌泰祝世祿，江北公司邢　文，會豐公司汪王振，長江公司王巽之，通益公司陸　勛，廣業公司金志封等十六家米商，並到有列席之糧政特派員辦公處代理特派員汪達人，該處調節科長任星崖等，商討緊急措施辦決，標本兼治，積極對治本方面，根據第一期貸款糧商之決定，向北帮產米區常州無錫崑山等及南帮之松江　　朱家伯　等處分　解運，充裕民食，淸　對治攤方面，　　青驢米市塲掮客用非法「踢米球」式賣賣，並對糧商注意四業中引　業外人游資，從事米糧投機云。</p>
<h3>柏油銷路清淡　客貨開價多不依正市</h3>
<p>柏油已有兩星期未見整數交易。市面之不振，　可想見，蓋現在製燭銷場已在落令之時，而皂用因天時險暗無常，致製皂亦因之延滯，廠家擊有進意，難免觀望，乃客貨反絡繹有到，雙方議價不合，待時而沽者雖不乏人，然急於求售者亦頗有之，故近日縱有開出，均不依正市也，茲各行售價漸見低落，計禾本五萬六千元，內坪四萬七八千元，獨砠四萬元，蘭油三萬七入千元。</p>
<h3>南僑公司辦到　大宗工業原料</h3>
<p>上海南僑股份有限公司，係南洋舉僑所投費，創辦於民國二十年，勝利以來，爲適應環境需要，乃擴大組織，以雄厚賽本設立分公司於新嘉坡香港厦門天津台灣等處，專營歐美各國及南洋　島貿易，最近由美國及南洋新到各種大宗工業原料及食品種類甚多，對國內南北貨推介於國外者不遣餘力，該公司實負有溝通國內外貿易之鉅大任務云。</p>
<h3>中砂白步緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市以中砂白現貨軋缺，價乃續緊，公會劃盤初爲四萬八千元，後略盤旋，終達五萬元，步升四千元，客貨少數，初開四萬六千元，後亦達四萬九千元至五萬元，其他亦被帶緊。</p>
<h3>新茶行市堅定　陳茶仍無受主</h3>
<p>査四五批新龍井，溫杭兩產區之到源，依然魚貫不絕，惟貨方不忍輕易割愛，故底盤支持有勁，陳貨花色，一部份亟求現款之貨主，仍有鬆脫，而買戶既對於售價前途尙再看小，復因天津各處之去化亦趨呆頓，是以胃納益形不良，情况則在吐多吸少下，毫無起色可述，頂祁門等竟疲無受主。</p>
<h3>聯合國將召開　世界糧食會議</h3>
<p>糧食恐慌，遍佈歐亞，頃據有關方面消息，在美國舉行之聯總會議閉幕以後，聯合國將在美召開一世界性之糧食會議，以便討論增產供應與配給等商題，間我官方已接獲是項通知，將派行總楊特派員錫志代表我蘭出席云。</p>
<h3>偽幣登記問題</h3>
<p>特派員電部請示　星期一尙難開始</p>
<p>關於截止兌換後之爲幣登記問題，中行發行局原擬於下呈期一開始辦理，各地問時登記，現悉此事將暫不實行，因財部特派員辦公處爲下列四項問題，尙在　請財部核示中，其癥結所在，計爲（一）過去收兌數字，已極接近於僞「中儲行」之安行總額，（二）以一種之僞券而言，如五千元或一千元者，其收兌數往往超出於發行總數，（二）財政部雖電示登記僞券辦法，但現距月終已僅餘十天左右，舉辦登記，亦難徹底，（四）各地遺未兌換之僞券，大多在鄕區僻壤，而收兌機　如僅限四行二局，則鄕人勢必賠貼車資，方能登記，小量僑劵之持有人，將感得不償失，綜上所述，如欲儘數登記及兌換，惟有不眼日期，永遠兌換，方較可行，現正由特派員辦公處呈部核示中，一俟復到，即行遵照辦理云。</p>

<h3>讀「中華民族新論」</h3>
<p>— 慕蕾</p>
<p>出版處：商務印書館　著者：臧渤鯨</p>
<p>中華民族經過八年的苦鬥，已經戰勝了東亞的侵略魁首，榮列世界五强之一了。從這次長期抗戰中，中華民族經歷了無數的艱難困苦，畢竟獲得最後勝利的成果。中華民族的堅靱與偉大，早已昭示於世界。每個充滿着喜悅的中華兒女，更覺得自己的民族精神實在太可寳貴了。</p>
<p>在今日，正有很多的國民要希望確切了解自已民族性的偉大，明瞭自己民族性的特徵。可是關於討論民族問題的專書，尙不多見。最近我以兩個夜晚的餘暇，讀完臧渤鯨氏所著的「中華民族新論」，深感這本書在目前有迫切的需要。這是一本通俗的討論中華民族甫要問題的書，每個國民如果希望對這個重要問題！和切身有關的民族問題有正確的認識，都有一讀的必要。</p>
<p>本書以生物學的觀點，參合現代各種思想，民族哲學，敎育哲學做立論的根據。雖如作者所說，不是創作，不是發明，但就蒐集材料的充實，以及對於民族問題獨特的闡揚，已可見作者的用心了。在這本書裏，作者有系統地說明了中華民族何以要遭受這次嚴重的外侮，由民族的弱點，申述到潛伏着的偉大的民族精神，爲抗戰勝利的主要因素，並決定了中華民族以後的復興路向。</p>
<p>讀過第一章「緒論」，使我們知道這次中日戰爭，是我們中華民族五千年歷史上規模最大時問最長區域最廣的一次外族侵入戰爭。和過去歷史上的外族戰爭不同的地方就是過去所侵入的外族，文化程度都比我們低，久之漸爲我國所同化，而這次的强敵日本教育文化比我們發達，軍備比我們充足，加以狡詐陰險，無所不用其極。我們要戰勝他，必先恢復民族自信心，以自力求更生，不但希冀中華的富强和復興，同時還要分擔建設未來新世界的責任。作者强調此次大戰，爲我國積極的轉捩點，勉國人奮發圖强，起衰振廢。又從史例上說明民族性絕不是一成不變的，我們的民族，確有牠偉大之處，只要能把民族性的弱點加以改造，在反侵略的大集團戰爭中，可能居於舉足輕重的地位。</p>
<p>第二章「民族的意義」，說明民族的命運，決定個人的命運，對於民族與種族，文字，土地，國家，歷史等方面也都有叙述。屬於中華民族的各種族必須本唇亡齒寒之義，精神團結，保衛民族的獨立，並且發揚並保持優秀的民族傳統，擁戴領導抗戰的領袖，以激發偉工人的民族精神。</p>
<p>第二章「民族的形成」，由個人品格的形成，說到民族性的形成和民族的質與量，認爲一民族賢質之優劣，固足影響一民族之興衰，但只優而不衆亦屬美中不足，這是一個泛論。在第四章「中華民族的形成」裏，須進一步從優生學的觀點叙說中華民族的遺傳，更就自然環境與人爲環境，分析中華民族實擁有豐厚的天然富源，可惜未能應用科學的方法充分利用。最後復談及中華民族今日的技落，及敎育不良和民族性頽唐的結果，只有勵行民族救育，中華民族可以復興。</p>
<p>接着在第五章「中華民族的民族性」裏，說明民族命運與民族性以及民族性的形成問題。關於中華民族的特性，說得也很詳盡。作者引用美國傳敎士明恩薄分析我國民族性十五點：（一）活易死難的中國人。（二）沒有神經的中國人。（三）耐性太好的中國人。（四）不求準確的中國人。（五）寸陰不競的中國人。（六）勤勞的中國人。（七）撙節的中國人。（八）知足常樂的中國人。（九）自私自利的中國人。（十）無惻隱心的中國人。（十一）言而無信的中國人。（十二）爾詐我虞的中國人。（十三）愛面子的中國人。（十四）婉轉的中國人。（十五）客氣的中國人。這觀察純粹是外國人的主觀，而將我國人與外國人，尤其是美國人的性格對照而寫，至多可以看出我國人和美國人性格上顯然的不同。我們要以他山之石，可以攻玉的態度採長補短。作者又提出精神改造一點，希望轉風移俗的社會先覺起來倡導。</p>
<p>作者爲了强調民族的政造，更拿普法戰爭的實例，在第六章「民族性如何改造」裏，詳加閘議，說明菲希德十四次八開演講喚起全德意志的民族精神與自信心的事實，並以之和此次中日戰爭作比，振奮我們全民族的抗戰必勝的自信心，是很有力的一章</p>
<p>作者認爲加强民族意識和發揚民族精神，必須從敎育上着手。一個國家的教育決定了一個民族的盛衰興亡。作者提出國民精神發展的三個階段：第一階段，即以種族，環境，人口等要素而成，這是上古時代的民族性。第二階段即用該民族所造成的政洽，宗敎思想，文學等對於民族本身所發生的反響，而造成一民族性，近古近世的民族性大都屬於這階段。第三階段則是用自由的理想，自由的選擇，在社會組織之內，確定一個適合於該民族生存的敎育制度，然後再根據敎育制度中自己造成理想的民族性民族精神與氣節，現代世界各國都向這目標走。關於這些問題，作者特列「中華民族與新敎育」一章，發揮民族敎育的理論。敎育不能起越於時間與空間，而建築在抽象的理論之上，必須顧到民族與國家的需要。我國過去教育的缺陷，作者也檢討過，並從政治敎育，人格敎育，軍事敎育，師範敎育，天才敎育各方面發表了他的意見。有一節是「民族復興與締女敎育」，所提出的各點都是極中肯的。從婦女與民族存亡的關係，世界各國婦女的類型，我國新女性的病源，指示我國婦女今後應有的覺醒。</p>
<p>寫這本書時，敵人正展其最後狂暴的進擊，因爲已臨投降的前夕，在黔驢技窮之時，不惜傾其全力攻勢，以圖孤注一擲。作者於是就在第八章「中日戰爭與中華民族」裏拿現實的例證分析當局政治與軍事的局勢，並旁及敎育和建設等足以影響戰局的因素。作者認爲此次戰爭對民族本質的最大影響有二：（一）民族的自新。（二）民族文化的大混合。至於因戰爭而提高中華民族的國際地位，亦有論述。由中日戰爭而進而論到中華民族對於返次世界大戰的貢獻。中華民族在這次世界大戰中，對全人類有不可磨練的功績。作者在第九章「中華民族與世界大戰」中，從九一八到反侵略戰爭，這中間中華民族所發揮的力量，都詳盡討論過，末了並申述中華民族對世界大戰應有的認識與努力。有一節談三民主義與世界聯邦，說明了三民主義的世界觀，以及對於世界和平前途的偉大貢獻。世界大同的實現，便是三民主義最高理想的完成。</p>
<p>最後，在第十章「結論」裏，歸納中華民族今後應把握歷史，發揚光大，拿戰鬥，自信與生存去湔雪民族的奇恥大辱，進而求世界聯邦組織的完成。作者認淸復興民族的路向雖多，但須身體力行，從實踐中努力，所以他大聲疾呼：「力行第一」！</p>
<p>「中華民族新論」雖是出版不久的一本新書，但脫稿時日軍尙未投降，所以對於激勵民族自信發揚民族精神特別着重，目的在加强全國民衆爭取最後勝利的決心。現在全民抗戰已獲最後勝利，然而這本書依然有牠的價値。在建國過程中，我們也同樣需要對自己的民族有深切的認識。我希望讀者們從這本書中能够得着關於自己民族的有力的啓示。</p>

<h3>關於「中國名畫家叢刊」</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>在抗戰勝利前一年之中所寫的幾册「中國名畫家叢刋」，最近世界書局已經把它印成了「淸初六大畫家」，「元季四大畫家」，「晉唐二大畫家」三種，而且新書已經到手邊，使我覺得有無上欣慰。</p>
<p>當我開始寫這部書的時間，是二十三年的暑假，起初，不過只想把故鄉的名畫家王石谷作一個評傳和年表。因爲在抗戰期聞，鄕土文物的硏究與發揚，間接可以昂揚民族意識的。但是，在某一方面看，對古文化的研究探討，未始不是不長進的逃避現實表現。</p>
<p>所謂歷史上的大畫家，他們的生平和藝術，究竟是怎樣的？他們作風的繼承與傳授或影饗，又是怎樣的？在中國的許多美衛史或繪畫史中間，只給我們一個粗略的輪廓。可是，旣稱一代巨匠，生平藝術，怎麽可以如此簡略，……這棵的想法，老早在我腦海中縈迥着理。藝術體系之中，是佔着極關重要的部分。而還一個體系中的代表作家的史跡與藝學，實在有整理的必要。所以當我在完成「王石谷」以後，經友好的鼓勵與贊助，又繼續寫成了，淸初·明代·元季·晉唐的十五個大家的評傳和年表。</p>
<p>硏究中國畫家最感困難的，是生卒年歲的問題，譬如願愷之在『晉書文苑傳』中，只有「六十二卒於官。」到底他是生在何年？卒於何年？便成問題。又如黃大癡，李日華說他：「年九十餘碧瞳丹頰，……以爲仙去。」美紹書則云：「年八十六，不知所終。」王穉登云：「洪武中尙在。」更如王叔明，仇十開諸家，在遺作上根本不寫年代，年歲生卒更是弄不淸楚。</p>
<p>其次覺得困難的，是遺作的缺乏，對各家藝術的評覈，只有依賴後人論畫著述。可是，這些著述，爲「歷代名畫記」，圖畫見聞志，「宣和畫譜，國朝畫徵錄」等等，又是非常簡單的。</p>
<p>我並不因爲困難而停止工作。相反地，從旁證上獲得了解次生卒年歲的疑間，而于生平事蹟的評述之後，明晰地編列了個，的年表。雖然，其中不免錯誤別但可以確實地把每一個大家生平軌跡展開，至少可以從此得到一個可能正確的歷史觀念了。</p>
<p>關于各家藝術風格的論述，我的中心理論，還不脫「尙南貶北」的成說。因爲，文人發藝術是士大夫階級的藝術，那麽莫雲卿，董其昌輩的士大夫藝術理論，畢竟還是適用的。在可能範圍以內，竭力避免主觀的，狹隘的極端的批判，而採取客觀的折衷的說法。</p>
<p>藝術上的主張與理論，往往是一個作家的風格的中心，所以對于一個作家的畫論。詩文，可能的多量介紹進去，作爲明白作家藝術風格的帮助。</p>
<p>希望讀着我這幾本書的朋友，瞭解我寫作上的困難，把應該修正的地方，指點出來，加以改正，俾可抵於美善的境界。</p>

        <h1>1946 - n110</h1>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Invites Marshall to a Banquet; Marshall Begins Discussions on the Northeast Problem</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 19th] Special Envoy Marshall paid respects to Chairman Chiang and held substantive discussions with the representatives of both the Nationalist and Communist parties attending the three-person meeting regarding the Northeast ceasefire issue.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 19th] Before Marshall's return to China, the situation in North China was greatly turbulent. The situation in Suiyuan and Shanxi was critical. After frank negotiations between the Government and Communist parties in the Executive Headquarters, the tense situation began to ease.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 19th] Special Envoy Marshall went to the American Embassy at 10:00 AM on the 19th to speak with staff members. At 4:30 PM, he visited Executive Yuan President Soong Tzu-wen. In the evening, Special Envoy Marshall and his wife were invited by Chairman Chiang and his wife to dinner.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing, 19th] General Marshall is cautiously working to prevent civil war in the Northeast. Today, he consulted with officials at the American Embassy. According to various reports, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall dined with Chairman Chiang today, and afterwards, they likely discussed the Northeast situation in some detail. Today, Mr. Marshall, accompanied by Brigadier General Brink, Chief of Staff of the American Military Advisory Group, consulted with President Soong to discuss some of the reorganization plans previously drafted by Lieutenant General Wedemeyer. At the same time, observers are cautiously optimistic about Mr. Marshall's ability to resolve the Northeast problem, because many believe that the Communist Party, due to its occupation of several strategically important locations, is in an advantageous position in bargaining, and the Nationalist army's advance northward has made its flanks vulnerable to attack.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Aerial Reconnaissance Report: Changchun City Ablaze</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] Changchun fell into misfortune last night at 11:00 PM amidst raging flames and the desperate cries of innocent civilians. Approximately 20,000 Communist troops poured into the city from the west, south, and north, setting fire to any tall buildings they saw. According to a report from the pilot who flew to Changchun yesterday morning to drop food and orders to the besieged troops at Datong Square, the northwest corner of Changchun has become a sea of fire with approximately thirty fires burning. The Communist troops have begun a massacre in the city and are threatening residents to hand over security forces hidden in their homes. Furthermore, in the past two days, aircraft flying over Changchun to drop food have seen long columns on the Harbin-Changchun line rapidly advancing towards Changchun, all of which are Communist reinforcements. It is reported that these troops have recently acquired tanks, heavy artillery, and rocket launchers near Harbin, and their artillery targeting techniques closely resemble those of the Japanese.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang, 19th] (1) All radio stations in Changchun lost contact after 6:00 PM on the 18th. The situation is unclear. (2) Reconnaissance flights were dispatched on the 19th, but the city was silent, and the police station in Datong Square was burning. (3) In addition to our defending troops, there are still over a hundred Central Government takeover personnel in Changchun.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 19th] The security forces defending Datong Square in Changchun today may have ceased their unequal resistance, as reconnaissance flights to Changchun this morning found the city extremely silent with no activity, suggesting that the war has ended. However, a major battle is brewing in Gongzhuling, between Sipingjie to the south of Changchun, because this location is a range of hills running east-west, higher in elevation than Changchun. It is a place that military strategists must contend for. The Communist troops have concentrated a large force there to secure this southern gateway to Changchun. The Nationalist army is also rapidly advancing from Sipingjie towards Gongzhuling to reinforce Changchun. Who will ultimately control Changchun will be decided in the battle of Gongzhuling. Official sources indicate that the Nationalist army suffered considerable losses due to an unexpected encounter with superior enemy artillery before entering Sipingjie, but they ultimately captured Sipingjie and captured a foreign artillery battalion commander.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 18th] Recently, three to four aircraft have been flying to Changchun daily to drop food. Deputy Director of the Aviation Affairs Commission, Wang Shuming, is currently in Shenyang awaiting orders and coordinating everything.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 19th] The Nationalist army in Shenyang stated that the Nationalist troops defending the central district of Changchun have had their occupied area reduced to within six reinforced concrete buildings surrounding Datong Square. Although external radio communication has been completely cut off, the besieged troops continue to put up a valiant resistance against overwhelming odds. It was also revealed that the Northeast Nationalist Army Headquarters has moved to Sipingjie. It is said that the main force of the New First Army is now only forty miles north of Changchun.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping, 19th] Semi-official sources say that the fighting in Changchun is intensifying, with the Nationalist troops in the city being attacked by Communist artillery and confined to a few buildings in the city center. The Soviet army is scheduled to withdraw from Harbin on the 26th, just one week from now. Because there are no Nationalist troops in Harbin, many believe that fighting will not break out there as it has in Changchun. After capturing Sipingjie this week, the New First Army is advancing north towards Changchun, reportedly advancing only twelve li northward in three days.</p>
<p>[United Press Yan'an, 19th] Today, the Yan'an radio station broadcast that the Japanese and Nationalist troops inside Changchun City have been completely "eliminated."</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals in North and Northeast China Actively Being Repatriated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 19th] Hiroshi Nemoto, the chief of the Liaison Department for Post-War Affairs of Japanese Officers and Soldiers in North China, and other Japanese military leaders will be treated as war criminals and detained after their mission ends. According to orders from the Army Headquarters, the Japanese prisoners of war and expatriates under the jurisdiction of the 11th War Zone will be completely repatriated within this month.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping, 19th] Lieutenant Colonel Bellina, who is in charge of repatriation work at the Executive Headquarters, announced that the repatriation of Japanese military and civilians within Shanxi will be accelerated, with 3,000 people scheduled per day. According to a public announcement by the Chinese Ministry of Transportation, there are now sufficient train cars and locomotives on the railway between Taiyuan and Beiping to transport Japanese military and civilians eastward. In addition, the situation on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has also improved. The railway and telephone lines on the section from Jinan north to Yucheng, about sixty li, have been repaired, which is of great benefit to the repatriation work.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 18th, United Press] Allied Headquarters announced that preparations for the repatriation of Japanese nationals in Northeast China are underway. Many reception centers for Japanese nationals will be established. The one established on Huludao in Liaodong Bay has already been established. It is estimated that there are 1,603,000 Japanese nationals in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu High Court Releases Political Prisoners</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 19th] The Jiangsu High Court previously received orders to release political prisoners in order to demonstrate the government's implementation of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, granting equal and legal status to all parties and factions. Therefore, the High Court released a large number of political prisoners imprisoned for crimes against the Republic of China in open court on the afternoon of the 19th, totaling 51 people. The prisoners were excited beyond words upon their release. The list of their names is recorded as follows: Zhuang Tanjin, Ye Jinxiang, Shen Kou Nan, Wang Lei Er, Chen Desheng, Xu Junfa, Zhou Lingen, Ding Kuanqi, Li Jiashan, Xu Hanjie, Zhu Taoxian, Li Zhengrui, Hua Shanh Han, Huang Bingding, Li Tanlin, Li Yinnan, Pei Xiang, Wang Guangshan, Zhang A, Tao Jie, Gao Bin, Zhai Shengchang, Li Adi, Xie Zhiqiao, Wu Zuxing, Jin Bi, Qian Guosheng, Zhang Jinghua, Wu Ada, Wang Yinwen, Wang Ziyue, Xiao Axing, Li Shaopeng, Feng Peiwen (female), Song Santou, Chen Guifang, Huang Liankang, Feng Yungeng, Lu Atao, Wang Yongxing, Zhu Fuyuan, Zhang Biliang, Lu Aao, Zhu Laigen, Zheng Quanbao, Zhou Hongsheng, Zhang Yongbing, Chen Juncai, Wang Jinwan, Pan Bingshan, Wang Caisu. When the reporter inquired with the person in charge of the High Court, they stated that although political prisoners were on the list for release, those who had committed crimes under ordinary criminal law would still be punished according to their crimes.</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Department Expands Organization; Separate Agency Established to Specialize in Military Reorganization</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 19th] The Government side of the Executive Headquarters proposed yesterday to send an Executive Group to Changchun. The Communist side refused, arguing that a full ceasefire and cessation of transportation in the Northeast were necessary before considering sending a group.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping, 19th] Two teams from the Northeast Executive Group were summoned to Shenyang earlier this week to provide reports to the Acting Three-Person Group, and have now returned to Kaiyuan and Fushun. The Executive Headquarters has also dispatched a third Executive Group to Chaoyang in order to implement the ceasefire agreement within the borders of Jehol. Two other Executive Groups are stationed in Chifeng and Chengde.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping, 19th] In order to strengthen work efficiency, the Executive Headquarters has long had plans to expand its internal organization. After several discussions, it has been agreed by all three parties that, starting on the 20th, the existing Planning, Transportation, General Affairs, and News Sections will all be expanded into Departments, with Sections established under the Departments. In addition, a Translation Department will be established, and personnel have also been assigned. It is also learned that a separate agency will soon be established to specialize in military reorganization.</p>
<h3>Progress in the Arduous Eastward Repair Work on the Jiaoji Railway Line</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 19th] Repair work east of Xindian on the Jiaoji Railway Line continues to make progress. It has now been repaired to 3 kilometers and 420 meters from Putong Station.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 18th] According to people from Zichuan: After the Communist troops occupied Zichuan County, they immediately sealed up the properties of township and village chiefs and those who participated in the war of resistance. As of now, in the 213th district alone, this has affected more than 2,000 households. Tens of thousands of people have been driven out of the territory. Villagers whose properties have been sealed have their citizenship revoked, and any slight carelessness in speech is met with slaughter. As a result, strong young men flee together, and the land is barren and untended, creating a desolate scene.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Jinan, 19th] Colonel Lake, the American representative of the Jinan Group, has been recalled to the United States. The Beiping Military Mediation Department has announced the appointment of Colonel Davis as his successor. Mr. Davis arrived in Jinan from Qingdao on the 19th and assumed his duties immediately.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops in Northern Jiangsu Break Faith; Mediation Group Returns to Xuzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] Zhenjiang News... Communist troops in Northern Jiangsu launched an offensive starting on the 14th. Communist troops in Jiangyan, Taixian and Rugao have each added a regiment. Furthermore, the Communist troops attacking Jingjiang invaded Xingang Town. The Military Mediation Department's Northern Jiangsu Executive Group, angered by the Communist troops' blatant violation of orders and breach of faith, angrily returned to Xuzhou.</p>
<h3>Mr. Blanford, American Advisor to the Ministry of Finance, Flies to Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 19th] Mr. Blanford, the American advisor to the Ministry of Finance, flew to Shanghai from the United States a few days ago and is scheduled to fly to Chongqing on the 20th so that the Ministry of Finance can consult him on relevant financial issues at any time.</p>
<h3>PCC Subgroup Discusses Amendment to the Draft Constitution; Agreement Reached on Three Chapters; Stepping up Work; Discussions Continue Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 19th] The PCC Draft Constitution Amendment Drafting Subgroup will continue to meet at noon on the 20th in the State Council Conference Room to discuss the drafting of amendments to the draft constitution and accelerate the process.

<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 18th] The PCC Comprehensive Subgroup and the Constitutional Review Committee Consultation Subgroup held meetings both in the morning and afternoon of the 18th to continue consultations on the amendment of the draft constitution's articles. Many agreements were reached on the National Assembly discussed in the morning and the President discussed in the afternoon. Furthermore, representatives from all parties did not continue discussions on the government reorganization issue today.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Executive Yuan Routine Meeting Approved: Reorganization of the Hunan Provincial Government; Also Approved the Adjustment of Luxury Tax Rates</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 19th] Rumors about the reorganization of the Zhejiang Provincial Government are rife. In addition to Lei Fachao serving as Secretary-General, it is said that Chairman Shen has telegraphed Cheng Yuanfan, who is currently in the United States, to invite him to serve as the Director of Finance.

<h3>Listening to the Sound of Cannons in the Snow</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in Liaoyang, Guan Rongqin</p>
<p>Three weeks of wandering life have come to an end. Various scenes, figures, and the sound of cannons that once shook my soul still linger in my mind. It was on the morning of March 9th. Although I had heard that spring had arrived long ago, the vast expanse of white snow stubbornly sealed the earth. In Xinmin, only the chimneys, either square or round, hadn't completely lost their original shape. Everything else was dressed in white, and the cold air was charging and stabbing from all directions. However, it couldn't stop the people who had been huddling indoors by the stoves. People, both young and old, came out of their houses to watch the National Army, with whom they had lived for over a month, depart. Trucks, jeeps, carriages, and groups of armed soldiers were hurrying back and forth, making the already narrow streets seem even more cramped.</p>
<p>Outside the city, we traveled along a highway. The white snow covered it so densely that if someone hadn't walked ahead, no one would have known they were on a road. Because of the heavy equipment and the dazzling snow, trucks, carriages, and pedestrians would accidentally fall into the ditches beside the road. The truck I was riding in got stuck once, but it slowly climbed out after a few minutes. The vast white wilderness had little to break it up besides sparse, withered grasses trembling in the wind. Villages were hard to find. In the forty *li* from Xinmin to Damin Village, only two or three villages were visible.</p>
<p>Damin Village was a small town. There were many shops on both sides of the T-shaped street, and some businesses were quite large. We stayed at a bean oil mill. Soybeans were piled up like small hills. The shopkeeper even said they were out of beans, which shows the scale of the business. Although the territory had been recovered, the owner's conversation was still gloomy. He said that because of the war, business in the surrounding areas was difficult, and there were few goods coming in. The Communist army had been there a month ago and spent 400,000 to 500,000 on entertainment in the small town. His shop had to contribute 3,000 to 4,000. This talkative shopkeeper, who slept on the *kang* bed opposite me, would catch lice by the candlelight at night and talk to me about the experiences of the Northeastern people over the past fourteen years. They ate *gaoliang* husks, bran, and acorn flour—acorn flour that even livestock would get diarrhea from. If they occasionally bought a pound or two of rice or a piece of new cloth and the eagle-like puppet police and secret agents noticed, they would be threatened in various ways. If the other party "forgave" you, they would "confiscate" it and let you go. If they didn't "forgive" you (usually in a public setting), they would drag you to the police station and punish you as an economic criminal. Everyone had to suffer, except for these eagles and dogs themselves. They were well-fed and had full bellies, and their wives and children were also well-fed and bright. In fact, it was less about the odiousness of these eagles and dogs and more about the success of the merchants' manipulation.</p>
<p>On the way from Damin Village to Liaoyang, I stopped in no fewer than ten villages and towns. Sometimes I walked on snow, sometimes on muddy fields after the snow melted. It was difficult for heavy vehicles to roll on such muddy roads, and it was even more difficult for the heavily laden soldiers to walk. Pairs of felt shoes were wrapped in thick mud, which seemed heavier than their legs. Some soldiers had broken shoes and were hobbling through the mud in socks that had been patched many times. It would be better if there were no war ahead. Sometimes, when the sound of cannons and gunfire rang out ahead, it was even more difficult to walk. The result of the gunfire was scarlet blood. In Li Daren Village, ten *li* away on the south bank of the Hun River, I saw several National Army officers and soldiers lying on stretchers. I heard they had been injured a few hours earlier. Also in Li Daren Village, I saw more than ten Eighth Route Army soldiers lying in front of a farmer's house and in the corridors. Several had already died, and the others were seriously injured. The dead lay silently, some curled up, lying on wooden boards or sorghum stalks, and some lying straight on the ground. The wounded were also lying in one place, either using sorghum stalks or tattered cotton military uniforms as pillows. One was using the upper leg of his dead companion as a pillow. Reddish-brown blood seeped through the thick yellow cotton military uniform. I wanted to take a picture, but my trembling hands prevented me from doing so. A soldier with a leg injury, shaking all over, looked at me expectantly, as if he had thousands of words to say. I walked over and spoke to him. I asked him how he joined the Eighth Route Army. He said he had been dragged in near the train station. In the months after joining the army, he had tried to desert twice, but both times he failed. He told me with tears in his eyes that his brother was still in the Central Army. Looking at his contorted, painful face, I cursed everyone involved.</p>
<p>The most deafening and heart-wrenching cannon fire came from the Dongguang Mountain Village and Dahuang Village area, seven or eight *li* south of Li Daren Village. "Bang, bang..." It lasted for two full hours. During these two hours, I couldn't sit or stand still and could only wander around on the frozen river. A National Army officer named Jiang told me that the Eighth Route Army in this area had already collapsed, but a few days ago, two hundred cannons were transported from somewhere, allowing them to continue to hold out. He got this information from villagers who knew nothing about military matters. I don't know if it's reliable.</p>
<p>When the cannons fire, both the National Army and the Communist Army are busy, and the civilians are both busy and scared. Villagers in two small villages told me that the men had been taken by the Eighth Route Army to carry the wounded. Women and children were silent as cicadas in winter, trembling and hiding. Innocent children, not to mention losing their schooling, were threatened by terror day and night. The people most closely linked to the army were the cart drivers. Carts were needed not only to transport supplies and luggage but also to carry wounded officers and soldiers. Yang Shuyuan, the Eighth Route Army brigade commander who was wounded near Dahuang Village, was transported to the rear by cart (a vehicle with two cartwheels supporting a thick wooden board, which the locals call a flatbed cart). Several cart drivers who transported luggage and supplies for the Eighth Route Army told me that they received no pay for working for the Eighth Route Army. If they weren't forced, no one would want to go. Cart drivers who worked for the National Army received 100 yuan a day, plus the military provided food for them and fodder for the horses. They rarely got to eat hot rice during the New Year, but they actually got to eat it with the National Army. One cart driver said that he had been pulled by the Eighth Route Army to carry a stretcher. During marches, the Eighth Route Army made them walk in front, and when the cannons fired, the Eighth Route Army bent over or lay on the ground, crawling, but the civilians in the stretcher teams walking in front of them were still forced to hold their heads high and move forward. The stretcher team walking in front of the troops, and not allowed to lower their heads when fighting, I don't know what kind of tactic that is, probably another use of the "human wave tactic"?</p>
<p>The Eighth Route Army here mostly calls themselves the "People's Autonomous Army," which is as intriguing as the "Northeast Manchuria Democratic Allied Army." In any village or town where the Eighth Route Army has stayed, you will always see a large pile of slogans written in white ash. They love to use their own invented simplified characters. "Support" is written as "grab." Slogans like "Support the Northeast People's Autonomous Government," "Support the Northeast People's Autonomous Army in Maintaining Local Security," and "Support Chairman Chiang's Four Promises" (they are so clever) are displayed. In fact, the Eighth Route Army has a fairly close relationship with the Northeastern people. First, conscription (the people call it "taking Eighth Route Army soldiers"). Several to a dozen people are conscripted from a village or town. If they can't find enough, the village or town head is questioned. Second, sending grain. Twenty-eight *jin* of *gaoliang* rice must be sent from one *mu* of land. If you don't have it, you have to find a way yourself. Third, and most cleverly, "take from the rich to help the poor." Every time they arrive in a place, they investigate the local wealthy families, put them on a blacklist, and take the grain and rice from them to "distribute" to the poor, which can gain the approval of some poor people and attract the participation of some unemployed workers and desperate puppet police. Although, when they leave, the villagers stare blankly as bags of rice and white flour are transported away, and they don't care. Families with money or real estate are usually labeled with some kind of crime and fined tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. In Dazhifang, a small village of more than 300 households ten *li* north of Liaoyang, there were 58 wealthy families on the blacklist. The most was 120,000. It's also a coincidence that the National Army arrived on the eve of the payment. In order to get money, I heard two dramas: In Shacunpu, more than 30 *li* west of Shenyang, an old man in his sixties was taken away by the Eighth Route Army passing by. It's been more than twenty days, and there's been no news. The old man's nephew told me that if they could have scraped together the 80,000 yuan ransom, this unfortunate experience wouldn't have happened. Hong Xuru, the director of Hong Xuru Hospital in Liaoyang City, was charged by the Eighth Route Army with buying medicine from the South Manchuria Hospital and was asked for 500,000 yuan. This doctor, who was not wealthy to begin with, fainted upon hearing this huge number. After waking up, he told the Eighth Route Army representative that he would sell his house for as much as he could. The sudden stimulus was too great, and Dr. Hong died a few days later. The Eighth Route Army has withdrawn from Liaoyang. The Liaoyang City community held a grand welcome rally for the National Army the day before yesterday. Before the meeting, a welcome speech was printed, and there were a few sentences in the middle that said: "They always sing high-sounding words for the country and the people, deceiving the public, but the fox's tail is difficult to hide. As time goes on, the truth is revealed. Today, they arrest Zhang, and tomorrow, they kidnap Li. They always reach out their dirty hands to ask the people for money. Their behavior is even more despicable and shameless than bandits who kidnap people for ransom. The pain they give to the people is deeper than during the Japanese occupation. We, who are destined to suffer alive, after fourteen years of slave life, still have to endure the brutal levies and plunder of the Eighth Route Army bandits." A 71-year-old man, in the welcoming crowd, walked to the podium after the enthusiastic speeches of the representatives of various groups, unfolded a letter, and read it to Long Tianwu, the commander of the New Sixth Army, who was being welcomed. After reading it, he handed it to General Long. A passage in the letter was written like this: "...and pray that the commander conveys the immeasurable merit of Chairman Chiang to the Northeastern people for recovering our territory and restoring our freedom, and we will never forget it." After the old man finished reading, some elementary school students also presented the letters of appreciation they brought, one by one, to General Long and bowed. Also sharing this honor was Luo Ying, the commander of the New Shao Second Division.</p>
<p>The Eighth Route Army occupied Liaoyang for half a year. The citizens said that they came in three batches: The first batch was driven away by the second batch, and the second batch was driven away by the third batch. The third batch stayed for three months in a row until the New Sixth Army advanced to the front before retreating.</p>
<p>As Qingming Festival approaches, Liaoyang is getting warmer day by day. The white snow in the suburbs is gradually disappearing. Occasionally, a few sounds of spring thunder are heard outside the window, which at first sounds a bit like the sound of cannons coming from afar. The people of Liaoyang are not startled and hiding. They are gathering on the streets and roads, waiting to see the Eighth Route Army soldiers who have surrendered to the National Army walk by.</p>

<h3>A Plea for the People of the Northeast! – Please Don't Plant Another Landmine in the Northeast –</h3>
<p>When Special Envoy Marshall returned to Chongqing, the so-called "Democratic Allied Forces" of the Chinese Communist Party were intensifying their attack on Changchun. Telegraph communications with Changchun and Harbin were cut off yesterday, and last night it was reported that the Communist army was about to occupy Changchun. The Chinese Communist Party, which chanted "democracy, peace, unity, and unification," began to besiege Changchun within an hour of the withdrawal of Soviet troops, apparently wanting to seize the Northeast by force, which runs counter to the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference. Moreover, the weapons used by the Communist army to attack were the weapons surrendered by the enemy, and at the same time, Soviet planes flew low over Changchun as if on patrol. The international nature of the situation in Northeast China has gradually been shrouded in the smoke of war. According to the talk of General Du Yuming, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security Forces, when the Communist army entered Changchun, the government had only two or three thousand security guards in Changchun, who could only hold on to corners and resist in self-defense. How the Communist army's 500,000 troops, possessing various light and heavy weapons, were transferred from the Japanese army to the Communist army is unknown. From General Du's remarks, it can be seen that the key to the reason why the people of the Northeast are suffering from artillery fire again after victory and why the national army cannot take over sovereignty in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance lies entirely in the Communist army's deliberate attempt to partition the Northeast and plant a huge landmine for future world peace!</p>
<p>To understand the situation in the Northeast today, we must frankly point out that the important key lies in international relations. After Japan's surrender, the entire Northeast was under the control and rule of the Soviet army. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance opened a new page in Sino-Soviet relations on the one hand, and set a standard for the situation in the Northeast on the other. According to the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, the Soviet troops stationed in the Northeast should hand over the entire Northeast to the Chinese National Government for takeover. It was only natural for the Chinese government to send troops to recover the territory and take over the Northeast. Unexpectedly, the Communist troops encountered numerous obstacles, and the seaports in the Northeast could not be used. They had to advance along the Beining Railway from Qinhuangdao, while at the same time, the so-called Communist army could enter from Rehe or land in the area of Lushun and Dalian from the Shandong Peninsula. If there were no troops in the Northeast that did not obey the orders of the Central Army, there would be no artillery fire today. The national army's dispatch to the Northeast was based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance; what was the need for the Communist army to enter? Why didn't the Soviet army effectively stop this? The Soviet army had the obligation to assist the Chinese National Government in taking over the Northeast in accordance with the treaty, so why did it allow the Communist army to enter the Northeast first, leading to the current situation? Now that the smell of gunpowder in the Northeast is getting stronger, the Chinese people cannot but recognize the international relations involved. We still sincerely pray today that the Northeast will not become an international powder keg again. However, the Communist Party has a different intention, and insists on "digging good meat to make sores," insisting on planting another landmine on the land of the Northeast where our compatriots have endured hardship for fourteen years before finally returning to the embrace of the motherland!</p>
<p>The mission of Marshal Marshall's visit to China is to assist China in finding a way to achieve peaceful unification, which indirectly means eliminating the seeds of future international conflict, at least in the Far East. However, the current situation in the Northeast is exactly the opposite of Marshal Marshall's efforts. From the time Marshal Marshall arrived in China until now, the ruling authorities in China and other parties and factions, including the Communist Party, have all claimed that they advocate solving the current domestic situation through political means, which coincides with President Truman's advocacy of a strong, united, and democratic China. Therefore, since Marshal Marshall's arrival, we have seen the successful progress of the "Political Consultative Conference," the dispatch of military mediation executive groups, and the preparations for reorganizing the National Government and convening the National Assembly. All these efforts are aimed at promoting the stability of the situation in China and the realization of unified democracy. However, when the situation is gradually improving, in addition to the sporadic battles in various places, the Communist army still launches large-scale attacks on Changchun in the Northeast, hindering the national army's takeover. If the international community does not distinguish right from wrong today, but only knows how to call for a ceasefire, without clearly pointing out which side should be responsible for destroying the spirit of coordination since the "Political Consultative Conference," then how can we be sure that the fighting behavior that is appearing in the Northeast today will not appear in North China tomorrow, and how can we be sure that it will not appear in Central China the day after tomorrow? Because the Communist Party takes advantage of everyone's confused mentality of "no right or wrong" to first create the fact of demarcating territory, and then bargain and ask for mediation. I ask, what kind of country will the country become, and what kind of army will the army become? To be honest, if this continues, not only will Special Envoy Marshall be fooled, the American ally will be deceived by the CCP, but the people of China will one day suffer the great pain of the landmines buried by the CCP.</p>
<p>We are very ashamed that in the current situation, our compatriots cannot put national interests first, disregard the good intentions of the Allied mediation, and are willing to be puppets, doing things that harm the country and the people. But this is not something that can be solved by shame alone. Now that Marshal Marshall has returned to China and resumed his post, he is extremely concerned about the situation in the Northeast, just like the Chinese people, who do not want the Northeast to be buried in the ground again, and do not want the Northeast to become an international powder keg again. The situation in the Northeast is not only related to China's safety, stability, and chaos, but also to the peace of the entire world. Now it is clear that someone is playing with fire in the Northeast, and we should quickly extinguish this fire. It is clear that someone is burying landmines in the Northeast, and we should quickly excavate these landmines. The Chinese people have the following general understanding of the current situation in the Northeast: (1) The Northeast is a part of China's territory. According to the principle of territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity, no form of division of the Northeast is allowed. (2) In order to maintain the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty, no obstruction is allowed to the national army's takeover work. (3) All attempts to divide and dualize the situation in the Northeast will absolutely not be recognized by the real Chinese people. Therefore, the activities of the Communist army in the Northeast violate the common psychology of the Chinese people. In order to resolve the current situation, we advocate: (1) The military mediation executive group should immediately rush to the Northeast to strictly stop the Communist army's attack; (2) Regarding the takeover of the Northeast, the national army should complete its assigned tasks, and the Communist army should not obstruct it; (3) All national and Communist troops in the Northeast should wait for treatment in accordance with the reorganization and unified compilation plan. Whichever side violates the agreement should disband the troops on that side.</p>
<p>This is the most basic solution. In order to take into account the facts, there is no need to talk about many great principles of law and reason. We should quickly eliminate this seemingly right but actually wrong "internal dispute" situation. We should use the spirit of firefighters fighting fire to quickly extinguish the fire in the Northeast and quickly dig up the landmines in the Northeast. We make another sincere appeal to the CCP, and we once again plead for the people of the Northeast!</p>

<h3>Security Council Discusses Spanish Question: A Debate with No Result: Australian Representative Suggests Sending Subcommittee to Investigate: General Assembly Adjourns Until Next Tuesday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 19th Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council will meet next Tuesday to first discuss the report of the committee of experts on the Iranian question. As for the Spanish question, the Security Council will appoint a subcommittee to study whether Franco threatens world peace before discussing it.</p>
<p>The Security Council met on the evening of the 18th to discuss the Iranian and Spanish questions, but no results were achieved. At the request of Soviet representative Gromyko, it was decided to hold another meeting next Tuesday, at which time the Iranian question will be discussed.</p>
<p>When the Spanish question was discussed, a heated debate broke out. British representative Jebb accused the discussion of the existence of the Franco regime in Spain of interfering in Spain's internal affairs. Soviet representative Gromyko supported Poland's proposal to sever diplomatic relations with Franco, saying: The whole problem can be summed up in one sentence, that is, "The Fascist Party has launched a war for six years, and the blood has flowed into rivers and the corpses have piled up like mountains. Can Fascism still be allowed to exist?"</p>
<p>Australian representative Hodgson made a compromise proposal that has been supported by the representatives. Hodgson proposed to amend Poland's motion on Spain, proposing to appoint a five-member subcommittee to investigate the Spanish question and report back to the Security Council before May 17. Most representatives have not stated whether they support it, but they generally expressed interest and said that the proposal is likely to be accepted.</p>
<p>According to an informal survey of the Security Council representatives by the Associated Press, only Mexico, France, and the Soviet Union supported the Polish proposal to sever diplomatic relations with the Spanish Franco government. Soviet representative Gromyko declared that the proposal was worth considering, while Britain, Austria, and the Netherlands opposed it. The United States is still waiting for Poland to prove the charges before deciding, while Brazil, China, Egypt, and Australia have not yet expressed their positions.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] The United Nations Security Council Rules of Procedure Expert Committee today submitted a report that the parties to the Iranian question have applied for withdrawal, and opinions could not agree on whether it should still be on the agenda in terms of legality. Therefore, the question will be returned to the Security Council for further discussion next Tuesday.</p>
<p>British Representative Opposes Collective Severance of Relations with Spain</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] British representative Jebb declared in the Security Council today: "I cannot admit that the case that the Spanish government threatens peace, undermines peace, or has aggressive actions has been established. Therefore, it cannot be considered proper to ask to sever ties with the Spanish government now." The British embassy in Spain reported in January that there was no evidence to support the claim that German scientists were engaged in scientific research on new tactics in Spain, and no information has been obtained to confirm this rumor. According to the official British report, all assets of Germans in Spain, both in the East and in many semi-East areas, have been transferred to the Spanish government or the United Nations delegation in Madrid. There are now about 10,000 to 12,000 Germans in Spain, most of whom are in private capacities, and only about 2,500 officials, spies, and members of the National Socialist Party who have been found should be sent back to their countries. There are only about 150 former German soldiers in Spain. The UK has not received any information about National Socialist leaders hiding in Spain.</p>
<p>Stettinius Reiterates U.S. Position</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 18th] U.S. Representative Stettinius immediately reiterated the U.S. position, stating: "The position taken by the United States has been repeatedly stated. The late President Roosevelt wrote to the U.S. Ambassador to Spain a year ago, solemnly declaring that the United States cannot agree to the Franco regime's contact with the Axis powers), but we share the great friendship with the Spanish people. At the same time, we are happy to support the resolutions of the San Francisco Conference and the Potsdam Conference, believing that as long as the current regime in Spain exists, the country will not be able to become a member of the United Nations, which is a well-known fact. In short, the United States will sympathetically consider any action that is in accordance with the United Nations Charter, or any independent domestic action, that can reasonably achieve this goal, so as to eliminate the Franco regime and restore a democratic regime without causing civil war."</p>
<p>Guo Taiqi Points Out That We Have Not Recognized the Four Countries</p>
<p>Chinese representative Guo Taiqi spoke, expressing sympathy for the Spanish people and hoping that the country would soon join the United Nations as a member. Regarding the Polish representative's request to sever relations with Spain, Guo pointed out that China has never recognized the regime, so there is no diplomatic relationship at all, but the Security Council should not take any action unless it clearly proves that the current regime in Spain poses a threat to international security.</p>
<h3>New Security Council President Does Not Meet Expectations: Disorder in the Meeting Hall</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 17th Special Dispatch] The new President of the Security Council, Yassin Bey, used a gavel to maintain order in the meeting hall today. When the translator was translating, many listeners and journalists left their seats loudly, so the President had to use the gavel to restore order. Yassin Bey's assumption of the presidency is in contrast to Guo Taiqi. Yassin always speaks in an unusually low voice, which has caused resentment from reporters. Moreover, Yassin was obviously unable to decide when to adjourn and when to resume the meeting, which caused confusion in the last few minutes.</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy Commission: Guo Taiqi Appointed as China's Representative</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 18th Special Dispatch] The United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, China, Egypt, and Poland have appointed representatives to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Guo Taiqi is the representative of China.</p>
<h3>Franco Government Obstinately Goes Its Own Way</h3>
<p>Blatantly Retaining German Assets, Undermining the United Nations' Takeover Method</p>
<p>[United Press, Madrid, 18th] The Spanish Foreign Ministry today issued an order stating that changes in directors or senior officials of companies whose assets have been frozen in Spain must be approved by the government. The United Nations had previously forced German companies in Spain to accept United Nations personnel or those close to the United Nations to serve as directors in order to carry out the takeover. Today's order from the Foreign Ministry is aimed at this, and this action is tantamount to secretly undermining the United Nations' takeover method. In addition, the Foreign Ministry has ordered the unsealing of several Spanish trading companies, two of which have minority stakes held by the German Krupp arms factory.</p>
<h3>Spain Trains Troops to Invade Four Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] While the United Nations Security Council is discussing Spain's threat to world peace, Radio Madrid broadcasted tonight that armed forces are being trained within France to invade Spanish territory.

<p>the Assembly passed the following resolution: The member states of the League of Nations, out of concern for the welfare of the population, shall continue to fulfill their obligations of administering the trust territories in accordance with the regulations, pending the decision of the United Nations and the trust territories on other methods of transfer. The chief Egyptian representative, Pei, individually refused to vote in favor of this resolution, saying that since the League of Nations has been dissolved, Palestine should no longer be under trusteeship. The President replied that the Egyptian representative's statement would be submitted for study when the United Nations authorities meet in September. The final task of the League of Nations is to transfer the original texts of thousands of treaties and assets worth 50 million Swiss francs to the United Nations agencies. After the League's debts are paid, the remaining cash will be distributed to the members according to percentages, or deposited in the accounts of various countries under the United Nations agencies.</p>

<h3>The Emperor Smiled at the News that the U.S. and the Soviet Union Will Not Go to War! And He Wants to Become a Disciple of Jesus; A Conversation Between This Newspaper's Special Correspondent and Prince Takamatsu</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Special Correspondent, Zhang Zhongren, Tokyo, 19th] Prince Takamatsu, the younger brother of Emperor Hirohito, told reporters today that the Emperor was very happy yesterday because he heard good news from the President of the Information Bureau, Okumura. According to Okumura, relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union have greatly improved. The reporter asked Takamatsu: What exactly was the good news that Okumura reported to the Emperor? Takamatsu replied: Do you remember the rumors a month ago that the U.S. and the Soviet Union were about to go to war? The reporter said yes, and there were even more graphic rumors than that. To give you an example: a month ago, many American fighter planes and bombers were flying over Tokyo, and 90% of the Japanese were whispering that</p>
<p>aboard those planes were "Japanese kamikaze pilots" in American uniforms, who were going to China and then Manchuria to fight the Russians. After hearing this, Takamatsu smiled and said: "Okumura's report to the Emperor was very simple. He said that there would be no war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union now because the Soviet Union was not ready. The Emperor was overjoyed to hear this, and Japan can enjoy peace."</p>
<p>Takamatsu has recently invited Watanabe, a famous Japanese Christian, to tell him about the teachings of Jesus. It is now widely rumored in Tokyo that Emperor Hirohito will soon become a disciple of Jesus.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper's Tokyo Special Dispatch, 19th] "Mainichi Shimbun" will invite the newly elected representatives of the Japanese Diet to give speeches at Hibiya Park, explaining their future policies.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Prime Minister Shidehara today rejected the resolution of the joint committee of the Socialist, Liberal, Cooperative, and Communist parties demanding the immediate resignation of the Japanese cabinet.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] After the Chief Cabinet Secretary and major opposition leaders stated that the current cabinet should resign en masse, the Shidehara cabinet held a special meeting today to discuss countermeasures. The parties that won the general election last week are now scheming and holding secret meetings to gain political positions. Therefore, the future of the cabinet and the parties is still volatile and unpredictable. Chief Cabinet Secretary Narahashi suddenly issued a statement, urging the three parties to unite, and said: "The Shidehara cabinet must resign and negotiate with the three parties to stabilize the political situation." Liberal Party President Hatoyama said, "It is absolutely impossible to support the current cabinet. It is inconceivable for the cabinet to cope with the special session of the Diet in its current form." Shidehara tried today to become the president of the Progressive Party, using it as the core to absorb the votes of independent and small parties to consolidate the government's position, but the situation has expanded due to Narahashi's sudden and explicit statement. Narahashi also said, "If, after discussions with the Liberal Party and the Socialist Party, it is decided to nominate Hatoyama as Prime Minister, Shidehara will serve as Foreign Minister and cooperate with him."

<h3>Allied Council for Japan; Motion to Limit Speech</h3>
<p>Failed Due to U.S. Representative's Opposition</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] According to sources close to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, at today's meeting of the Four-Power Allied Council for Japan, the representatives of China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union proposed a procedure to limit the time and materials of speakers attending the committee. However, the U.S. representative, Marquette, strongly opposed it, arguing that those invited to report should be allowed to provide as much information as possible. Limiting them would be tantamount to limiting the activities of the committee itself. The purpose of the U.S. representative's proposal is to allow MacArthur to fully provide opinions in the Four-Power Allied Council. Although the U.S. representative was isolated, he was able to prevent the passage of the motion because the committee has no voting procedure and cannot force representatives to agree. As a result, the Four-Power representatives could not reach an agreement on this matter.</p>

<h3>Pan Yangyao and Others Transferred; Faces Covered with Beards, Haggard; Carry Luggage into Prison Gates</h3>

<p>Yuan Lvdeng and Wu Songping, two of the "Three Old Men," and Chuan Shishuo, and others have been prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on the 16th. The indictment was delivered to the Tilanqiao High Court by the High Procuratorate yesterday. Personnel were dispatched to the prison to read it to each prisoner and send it to their families so that the lawyers hired by the defendants could prepare their defense based on this. It is predicted that several people will be publicly tried within the next week.</p>
<p>Recently, the High Procuratorate has been busy day and night investigating the prisoners in custody.

<h3>Shanghai Military Court; Public Trial May Be Held Next Week; More Than 80 Japanese War Criminals in Custody</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Military Court of the First Pacification Command has been extremely busy with the interrogation of Japanese war crime suspects for the past month. There are currently more than 80 Japanese war criminals in custody, most of whom were detained and sent for trial by the Shanghai Port Transportation Command based on the list of war criminals announced by the Army Headquarters. As for the war criminals who have been brought to court for interrogation, the few who have complete documents will be publicly tried around the 25th of this month.</p>
<h3>China and the United States Will Jointly Try Seven Nazis</h3>
<p>Seven Germans who were arrested as Nazis some time ago not only cooperated with the Japanese during the war but also continued to work secretly after the victory of the war of resistance against Japan, plotting various acts of sabotage, with conclusive evidence. The U.S. War Crimes Trial Committee has cooperated with our authorities and will jointly try the German war criminal case in the near future.</p>
<h3>City Health Bureau Promotes Epidemic Prevention Movement: Smallpox Patients in the City Have Decreased</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Due to warmer weather and the active prevention efforts of the City Health Bureau, the number of smallpox patients in the city has decreased this month. According to statistics from municipal hospitals, there were 179 patients last month, while this month, up to the 17th, there were 75.</p>
<p>The Bureau, recognizing the importance of epidemic prevention work as summer approaches, has drafted a summer epidemic investigation plan through the Epidemic Prevention Department and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval. Once approved, funds will be allocated immediately to promote the work. The main points of the plan can be divided into four areas: (1) Cleaning up earth wells to prevent insect breeding. All earth wells within the city will be filled in. In the suburbs, personnel will be sent to conduct on-site investigations and inspections. Those not deemed essential will also be filled in. Wherever possible, connections to the city water supply will be requested from the water company. Otherwise, residents will be supervised to clean and maintain the wells. (2) Administering vaccinations. The Bureau is actively producing vaccines, expecting to provide enough for four million people, and will begin serving citizens on May 1st. (3) Spraying DDT. The main use of DDT is to kill insects such as lice, mosquitoes, and flies. Powdered DDT is particularly effective against lice. One quart of a 5% DDT solution can be applied to 250 square feet, with a lasting effect of two to three months. If needed to eliminate mosquitoes and insects, applications may be submitted to the City Health Bureau. However, due to the limited quantity of DDT received by the Bureau, it is currently unable to provide a large supply and is requesting further allocation from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Regarding releasing DDT in suburban rivers and streams, the Bureau plans to conduct local trials first because DDT contains toxins, and villagers drink and wash vegetables from these water sources, which poses a potential danger. Therefore, releasing DDT in flowing streams is not planned. (4) Public health education to citizens. Citizens must not consume raw water or raw vegetables, and should especially avoid buying food from street vendors. The Bureau will request the cooperation of the Police Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to jointly crack down on summer fruit stalls.</p>
<h3>Tram and Bus Fares Increase Today: Relevant Authorities Announce Reasons for Fare Increase; Companies' Heavy Losses Must Be Remedied</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Tram and bus fares in the city are adjusted starting today (the 20th): Tram first class minimum $90, maximum $200; third class minimum $60, maximum $120. Bus minimum $100, maximum $300. According to the relevant authorities of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, public transport fares in the city are determined based on the necessary expenses of each company as the standard. As employee wages have increased repeatedly in accordance with the cost of living index, operating costs have also increased sharply. Furthermore, due to skyrocketing material prices, damaged vehicles cannot be repaired, especially tires, which are unaffordable, leading to a reduction in the number of vehicles in service. For example, the British-owned trolleybus company originally had 130 trolleybuses, but now only 42 are in service. The British tram company has accumulated losses of $960 million; the French company has accumulated losses of $787 million, so it is imperative to remedy the situation quickly. To take into account the reduction of transportation costs for administrative organ staff, engineers and workers, and students in the city, the Bureau has specifically instructed each company to issue half-price monthly tram passes starting in May to show preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Train Fares Have Not Increased Yet</p>
<p>Hu, Deputy Director of the Transportation Department of the Two Roads Administration, told a reporter from the East China News Agency yesterday: The rumor that train tickets will increase fourfold is a misunderstanding based on the new fares for the Shanghai-Hangzhou special express train of the Bureau. In view of the upcoming Easter holiday, the Bureau has specially opened a Shanghai-Hangzhou special express train yesterday to facilitate various agencies and organizations. This train is limited to first and second class passengers and departs from the North Station every morning at 6:40 AM. To avoid crowding, the fare is four times higher than other special express trains, and seats must be reserved with tickets to limit the number of passengers. This fare is temporary and will be reduced to the original price after April 22. As for the general increase in fares on the two lines, the Bureau has not yet received an order from the Ministry of Communications to increase fares.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Installing Telephones</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is currently facing a shortage of materials at the Shanghai Telephone Company, and the equipment at each exchange is already full, and there is no spare capacity on the lines in each district. Applications for installation continue to pour into the company, and the company is unable to cope. In the future, in order to cooperate with the government's post-war reconstruction and to meet the urgent needs of military and government agencies, it is necessary to restrict telephone installation. Temporary restrictions on telephone installation by the Shanghai Telephone Company have been stipulated and implemented from the 15th of this month. It is reported that the regulations stipulate that applications for telephone installation to the Shanghai Telephone Company are limited to military and government aviation agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, military aviation agencies, state-owned industrial and commercial institutions, and public utilities, and whose telephone needs are essential for public service and of an urgent nature. It is also reported that each agency must issue an official letter, signed by the highest official, before applying directly to the Shanghai Telephone Company.</p>
<h3>Assisting Post-War Reconstruction, Several Ships Set Sail to Hankou on Assignment</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The return to the capital and post-war reconstruction have begun, but there is a great shortage of transportation means such as railways, highways, air transport, and ships. The Ministry of Communications is making every effort to allocate resources, but the transport capacity is still limited. According to relevant sources, under the current circumstances, the reconstruction transportation can handle "up to 50,000 people. If the transportation means can be adjusted, the transport capacity can be increased." Some of the city's river ships have been ordered to go to Hankou on assignment. The Changxing ship of the Sanbei Company is scheduled to sail to Hankou today, without carrying cargo or passengers. The ship's power has been enhanced after this repair. During this flood season, the ship's body is large and has a large capacity, which is very suitable for post-war reconstruction transportation on the Beijing-Hankou section. The Jiangshun ship of the China Merchants Group has already been assigned, and the Jianghua ship will also be transferred to Hankou next week. The Jiangde ship of the Dada Datong Joint Venture left the port on the morning of the 17th to sail to Hankou for assignment, but was withdrawn due to wind and damage to the ship's body, so it stopped sailing to Hankou. This time, it carried more than ten tons of goods. Yesterday it was wrongly published as more than a thousand tons. Also, the Hongda ship of the same company was also ordered to sail to Hankou and is scheduled to set sail next Monday morning. The Dafeng ship is also scheduled to sail to Hankou next week on assignment.</p>
<h3>Case of Murder of American Pilots in Hankou: Five War Criminals Sentenced to Death Next Monday; Execution by Hanging in Secret</h3>
<p>The five Japanese war criminals who murdered three American pilots in Hankou previously, including Major General Kaburaki Masao, were sentenced to death by hanging by a U.S. military court at the end of March. The U.S. military has scheduled the execution to be carried out secretly at Tilanqiao Prison in the city on the afternoon of the 22nd of this month (next Monday). In addition to supervision by the U.S. Military Police Command, outside viewing is prohibited. The five war criminals are Major General Kaburaki Masao, former Chief of Staff of the Japanese 13th Army; Warrant Officer Fujii Tsutomu, Chief of the Personnel Section of the Japanese Hankou Military Police Command; Staff Sergeant Masui Shozo, Private First Class Shirakawa Yosaburo, and Sergeant Matsui Koichi. All were sentenced to death by hanging as principal offenders and are now held in Tilanqiao Prison. The three American pilots they killed were tortured until they were covered in wounds, and then strangled to death with thick hemp ropes. After the victims died, the Japanese burned them, thinking that no one would know on a dark and windy night, but they did not expect that they would have to pay with their lives today.</p>

<h3>Readers' Response – Legal Queries</h3>
<p>Zhou Dexing asks: Mr. Jia lost his wife two years ago and has not remarried. He now intends to marry the widow Ms. [Surname] (outside of the five degrees of mourning) of Mr. Yi, a nephew in the same clan. Is this legally permissible? Kindly advise.</p>
<p>Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies: Collateral relatives by marriage of different generations, if outside the fifth degree of kinship, are not restricted and can marry.</p>
<p>Hui Yiqing asks: I have several questions regarding the enemy and dare to ask your column for guidance: (1) Do any documents have a validity period? (2) If all the parties related to writing a document have passed away, is the document still valid? (3) A, B, and C jointly own a plot of public land. This land happens to be adjacent to A's house foundation, so A has been planting vegetables on it for decades, and B and C have never objected. Recently, A and B have become estranged, and B now forbids A from planting. Can A consider this a fait accompli and ignore it, or is there an appropriate way to deal with it? (4) A has ancestral land that was seized by B relying on his power more than ten years ago. Now A wants to reclaim it, how should he do so? (5) Tian has a piece of ancestral land with an area double the size of the document he holds. Can this become a reason for others to encroach upon it?</p>
<p>Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies: (1) It depends on the nature of the right. For example, ordinary debt instruments expire if not exercised within fifteen years. (2) Even if the person who wrote the document or the scribe has passed away, the document is still valid, but other handwriting or the seal affixed must be found to prove it. (3) Only those who possess another person's unregistered real estate with the intention of ownership, peacefully and continuously for twenty years, can request registration as the owner.

<h3>The First Shanghai Municipal Councilor Election is Approaching – Voters Must Not Give Up Their Rights</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Canglong</p>
<p>Sowing the Seeds of Democracy</p>
<p>In today's world where the call for "democracy" resounds through the clouds, the upcoming election of the first Shanghai Municipal Councilors on April 28th cannot be said to lack profound significance. However, from all perspectives, the preparation time for this election is relatively tight. At the same time, citizens still lack an understanding of the importance of the Municipal Council and the election of Municipal Councilors. The reporter would like to briefly introduce the information collected on this aspect:</p>
<p>Council Powers are Related to the City</p>
<p>First, we might as well first understand the powers of the Municipal Council. According to Article 2 of the Municipal Council Organization Regulations: The Council shall deliberate on (1) matters related to completing local autonomy, (2) municipal single regulations, (3) municipal budget review and municipal final accounts, (4) municipal taxes, public bonds, and other increases in municipal treasury burden, (5) management and disposal of municipal property, (6) matters submitted by the mayor. In addition, it can also suggest matters for the improvement of municipal administration, listen to the government's policy reports and submit inquiries to the government, accept citizens' petitions, and other matters granted by law. In other words, the Municipal Council is the representative body of the people of the entire city. Looking at the ten tasks of the above duties, it can be said that none is not closely related to the interests of the citizens themselves. Since we do not allow our own interests to be harmed, we must do our best to elect municipal councilors who can represent the interests of the citizens!</p>
<p>Voter Registration is Like Phoenix Feathers and Unicorn Horns</p>
<p>Some say that in the dark ages when the enemy and puppets occupied the area, good talents all hid away. Then, now that the sky has been re-lit, and after eight years of bitter waiting, it should be a golden opportunity to stand up and serve the people. However, it is said that many citizens in the district and bao have the intention to shirk their duties after being elected. And this time, those applying for qualification as candidates for public office are only over a thousand people. In addition, voter registration, in principle, anyone over the age of 20 who holds a national identity card or receives a receipt for the national identity card can register at the nearest bao office to obtain voter qualification. But in fact, those who can personally go to the bao office to register are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Therefore, as a temporary solution, the Civil Affairs Bureau will issue the voter list to the bao offices to compile the voter registration list on their behalf. This will enable citizens of this city who have voter qualifications (estimated to be around 2.04 million) to participate in the election in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Quota for Election Specifies the Standard for Production</p>
<p>The quota for regional elections of municipal councilors in this city is based on Article 4 of the Municipal Council Organization Law, which stipulates that the selected basic number is nineteen, and for every 30,000 people exceeding 100,000, one is added. According to the population census statistics in February of this year, the total population is 3,345,875 people, so it should be 108 people, so the total quota for regional elections is 127 people. This city is now divided into 32 districts, of which Districts 27 and 28 have not yet been delineated, and the election in District 32 is temporarily postponed. In addition, the distribution of quotas for each electoral district is based on Article 9 of the Municipal Council Election Regulations, which is produced in proportion. That is to say, anyone with a population of 2,345 people will produce one person. The remainder will be assigned to the districts with the most zeros in the remaining numbers. In this way, Taishan District has the largest population and is allocated 13 seats, Xincheng District is the next largest and is allocated 10 seats, and so on. As for the number of municipal councilors to be elected by vocational groups, the regulations stipulate that they account for three-tenths of the total number of councilors. Then three-tenths of 127 is 54, so the total number of councilors in this city is 181. Councilors in each electoral district are directly elected by voters in their respective districts, while vocational groups must determine their election system based on the number of member units to which they belong. For example, the elections of the Fishermen's Association and the Education Association adopt a direct election system, where members directly elect. The Chamber of Commerce, the Trade Union, the Farmers' Association, and the Freelancers' Association, because they have more member units, adopt a two-stage election system. First, each unit elects three people as primary electors, and then they jointly re-elect.</p>
<p>Not Much Interest in Running for Public Office</p>
<p>We might as well try again to observe the regulations for the qualifications of candidates for public office. So-called candidates for public office can be divided into two types, A and B, both of which must pass an examination. Those who pass the Type A public office candidate examination can be candidates for municipal councilors and district heads and deputy district heads. Those who pass the Type B public office candidate examination can be candidates for district representatives and bao heads and deputy bao heads. The examination method is divided into two types: examination and qualification review. Qualification review only requires submitting documents and reviewing qualifications. Those who pass the qualification review will obtain candidate qualifications without having to take the examination again. This city is now conducting qualification reviews first, which are reviewed by the Municipal Government's Shanghai Public Office Candidate Qualification Review Committee. Applicants for both Type A and Type B public office candidate qualifications must be citizens of 25 years of age. Now, apart from the Type B qualification regulations, which are more common and will not be discussed, let us first discuss the Type A qualifications. According to the regulations, they must have one of the following qualifications, namely: (1) former county councilors, (2) former township representatives or township chiefs for more than two years, (3) those with appointment qualifications for commissioned positions, (4) those with general examination qualifications and more than three years of social service experience, (5) those who have passed autonomous training and have more than three years of social service experience, (6) those who have handled local public welfare affairs for more than three years, (7) those who have held key positions in vocational groups or other people's organizations for more than three years, (8) those who have been engaged in freelance professions for more than three years. Question: Among the more than 3.3 million people in this city, is it possible that only the thousand or so people mentioned in the newspaper can apply for Type A public office candidates with one of the above qualifications? This is another strong proof that citizens of this city lack interest in running for elections.</p>
<p>A Powerful Test of Promoting Democracy</p>
<p>Now the deadline for applying to register as a candidate for public office has passed. We have given up the qualification to be a candidate for public office in the first place, but we must never give up the right to vote in the second place, because the right to vote is a basic right of the people. Looking at the countries that have been modernized and the advanced nations after this war, who is not burning the torch of democracy vigorously? Now that the government is determined to implement universal suffrage, it is to sow a seed for the implementation of true democracy and the principle of returning power to the people, and to raise a torch. This seed can only grow stronger, and this torch can only shine brightly. This election of municipal councilors in Shanghai is a most powerful test!</p>
<h3>Qingming Festival · A Corner of Wei Yuan – Visiting the Hu Mulian Group</h3>
<p>— Chongqing Airlines Dispatch on the 10th, Dispatched by Our Special Reporter Zhao Haosheng</p>
<p>During the Qingming Festival, Chongqing has good weather that makes people unable to restrain their laughter from bursting out from the bottom of their hearts. The People's Political Council, which had been in session for half a month, has just closed, and I feel infinitely light in spirit. Taking advantage of this rare leisure time, the reporter made a pleasant visit that was completely free of annoying "politics."</p>
<p>Originally, during the half month that the People's Political Council was in session, Hu Senator could often be seen in the meeting place and in the car. However, every time was rushed and there was no time for a leisurely conversation. After the meeting, Hu Senator was also relatively free, so the reporter made a special visit on the second day after the closing – March 4th, which was the Qingming Festival.</p>
<p>Miss Hu Mulian! From here on, I will use this title – the senators in the People's Political Council all call her that. "Miss Hu" seems to contain more meaning than "Senator Hu," so "Miss Hu" is a louder title than "Senator Hu."</p>
<p>Simple and Elegant</p>
<p>Miss Hu's residence in Chongqing is on Chuandong Normal Street. On the wooden plaque above the door, two faint characters are written: "Wei Yuan."</p>
<p>Walking through the bamboo door, there is a courtyard built on the hillside, like many "gardens" in Chongqing. Inside are rows of unconnected houses, each family living separately, surrounded by bamboo fences, forming a general name "× Yuan." This is a very common type of residence for the upper-middle class in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Miss Hu's home is a square bungalow. In front of the door, there is a green flower stand. The weak branches of morning glories have just stretched up from the ground. In the height of summer, there may be a lush canopy on the flower stand. In front of the door, a flat piece of concrete. A small, clean-haired black dog is lying there sunbathing. Looking around, it is a scene of tranquility. This has more of a simple and elegant flavor than the Hu Mansion I imagined.</p>
<p>Preparing to Return to Guangzhou First – Many Things to Deal With</p>
<p>Just as everyone has heard, Miss Hu loves to wear monochrome clothes. That day, she was dressed in all black, a black cheongsam, and a pair of embroidered black satin shoes, simple and homely. She greeted the reporter with a happy face. The first sentence was to say that she shared the fatigue of the closing of the People's Political Council, and then she greeted the maid who came out in Cantonese: "Pour some tea!"</p>
<p>Miss Hu speaks Mandarin very well. Her conversation is practical and kind, and there is absolutely no air of a "women's rights activist." The reporter first asked: The People's Political Council has closed. When does Miss Hu plan to leave? Back to Guangzhou or to Shanghai or Nanjing? She said that she would probably have to leave in a week or two. She would have to go back to Guangzhou first, and then go to Shanghai and Nanjing to see. When the reporter mentioned that if, as suggested by the People's Political Council, the number of National Assembly representatives increased, I am afraid that Miss Hu would have to rush to Nanjing before May 5th, she smiled. She said that the matter of increasing the number of National Assembly representatives has not yet been decided, but she has many things to deal with in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Speaking of Guangzhou, the reporter remembered what everyone was most concerned about, the situation of Mr. Hu Zhantang's Jiyuan after the disaster. Regarding this matter, Miss Hu also had a lot to say, so she picked up a cup of black tea handed by the maid and began to listen to Miss Hu's narrative.</p>
<p>Miss Hu said that Mr. Zhantang's cemetery is in Longyandong, outside Guangzhou City. Construction began in the year the Anti-Japanese War began, but it was interrupted because she was afraid that the enemy would use it as a military target to bomb it. In order to explain the cemetery situation in more detail, Miss Hu went back to the bedroom and took out two large thick books, which were the entire plan for the construction of Mr. Zhantang's cemetery.</p>
<p>Unveiling the first page of the "Hu Former Chairman Cemetery Project Plan" made by the Jintai Construction Company, there is an aerial view of the entire cemetery plan. Miss Hu pointed and explained in great detail.</p>
<p>Visiting Mr. Zhantang's Tomb and Planning to Resume Work</p>
<p>During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, Miss Hu missed the safety of the cemetery from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, Guilin, and Chongqing all the time, so the first thing she did after the victory was to rush back to Guangzhou to "visit my father's tomb."</p>
<p>This time Miss Hu came from Guangzhou, in addition to attending the People's Political Council, and to make a request to the government regarding the reconstruction of the cemetery. Fortunately, the entire engineering plan was still there during the eight years of relocation, and everything had old rules to follow. Miss Hu had already spoken with President Song and could resume work according to the original plan.</p>
<p>Miss Hu has two copies of the engineering plan, which were made by Jintai Construction Company after three months of surveying. In January of the 26th year, the Central Government approved it. Construction began in June of the same year, followed by the "July 7th" Incident. This nationally commemorative project was interrupted due to the country's Anti-Japanese War, and it will be resumed after the victory of the war, which really increases its lofty significance.</p>
<p>After Miss Hu returns to Guangdong, she will begin to prepare for the resumption of work. A few months ago, General Zhang Fakui ordered Japanese prisoners in Guangzhou to work and restore the earthwork of the cemetery.</p>
<p>Mentioning the Coffin of Madam Hu, she was Saddened</p>
<p>The reporter asked about Madam Hu, which aroused Miss Hu's memories of the sighing life of relocation during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. Madam Hu passed away in Chongqing in the 25th year, which is her saddest memory in eight years. Madam Hu's coffin has been returned to Guangzhou by road after the victory. In addition, Mr. Zhantang's relics, manuscripts, etc., have not been lost at all due to Miss Hu's cherishment and preservation during the eight years of relocation, and have now been transported back to Guangzhou. The national treasure is safe, which is really not just Miss Hu's joy!</p>
<p>Due to Miss Hu's extremely homely conversation, the reporter asked more about Miss Hu's family affairs, which is also what the people of the country are extremely concerned about. Mr. Zhantang has many brothers, but his only dear and beloved is Miss Hu. Mr. Zhantang carried his only beloved daughter with him in all his activities during his lifetime. Mr. Zhantang's revolutionary life is closely linked to his beloved daughter. Mr. Zhantang's historical achievements were also written by this only beloved daughter. After Mr. Zhantang passed away, Miss Hu did not interrupt her political life. After Madam Hu passed away, Miss Hu lived even more bravely on her own. All of this can be clearly seen from Miss Hu's treatment of people and conversation.</p>
<p>Hu Mansion May Be Sold – Words Contain Humor</p>
<p>The visit, which lasted about two hours, finally brought the conversation back to the question of when to leave Chongqing. This time, Miss Hu asked the reporter where she was going. The reporter told her that she planned to go to Shanghai around the 20th. She talked about her memories of Shen Bao, so the reporter asked her to give a recent photo to the newspaper and asked her to sign a business card, which she readily agreed to.</p>
<p>Leaving, under the flower stand, the reporter asked Miss Hu whether this house was rented or built by herself? She said that it was built after she came from Guilin to Chongqing, and now she plans to sell it. Then, she humorously added: "This time I leave, I probably won't be coming back."</p>
<p>She very politely sent the reporter to the door, and in the voice of "See you in Shanghai!", she stepped out of "Wei Yuan."</p>
<p>Hoover Plans to Relieve World Famine</p>
<p>Former US President and World War I Food Administrator Hoover (left), with Secretary of Agriculture Anderson (center), and Famine Relief Committee Chairman Davis (right), held talks on food issues in Washington, D.C. President Truman specially appointed Hoover to organize a committee to reduce domestic food and relieve famine victims in Europe and the Far East. Hoover will go to Europe and the Far East to inspect the famine situation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government Sets Voter Precautions</h3>
<p>As the date of the Municipal Councilor election in this city is approaching, the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government has specially printed various colored small slogans in order to expand publicity and encourage all citizens to participate enthusiastically. The slogans include "Voting is a Basic Right of the People, Do Not Abandon Your Right to Elect Municipal Councilors," and eight other slogans for distribution everywhere. It also plans to consult with the aviation authorities in Shanghai to use airplanes to spread them. In addition, it has notified all cinemas in the city to display the slogans as slides to expand publicity. Mayor Qian Dajun, Director Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and social celebrities will give broadcast speeches to explain the meaning of elections, election ethics, and to lecture on election and lecture matters. In order to awaken the attention of the citizens in the urban area, the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government has decided to sound a long whistle at 6:00 AM on Election Day (the 28th of this month) and notify factories in the suburbs to also sound a long whistle at that time to awaken the people in the suburbs to participate in the election.</p>
<p>The district elections for the municipal councilors of this city adopt a universal suffrage system. The general public is not fully aware of the voting order and voting methods, and is prone to errors. The Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government has specially formulated voter precautions for participating in district elections for voters to follow.</p>
<p>(1) Voters should arrive at the polling place at the prescribed time and wait in line in the order of arrival, and must not rush to be first.</p>
<p>(2) Voters should abide by order and follow the guidance of the election officials when voting.</p>
<p>(3) Voters must not smoke or make loud noises while waiting to vote.</p>
<p>(4) Voters who are drunk or carrying weapons are not allowed to enter the polling place.</p>
<p>(5) During voting, no one other than polling place officials and voters is allowed to enter the polling place without permission.</p>
<p>(6) Voters in the polling place, except for matters related to voting methods, may ask the staff for inquiries, but must not talk to others.</p>
<p>(7) Voters who cannot write the ballot should ask a scribe to write it, and must not ask others to handle it on their behalf.</p>
<p>(8) Before arriving at the polling place, voters should prepare the identification documents they should carry, such as a national identity card or other proof issued by the Baojia head.</p>
<p>(1) After entering, voters should first go to the document verification office to submit and read the documents, and sign the voter registration list.</p>
<p>(2) After signing, go to the ballot receiving office to collect the ballot.</p>
<p>(3) Go to the ballot writing area to fill out the ballot. When writing the ballot, pay attention to the following two points:</p>
<p>(A) The election adopts a non-named single-vote system.</p>
<p>(B) The ballot is invalid if any of the following circumstances occur:</p>
<p>(1) Writing is not in the prescribed format.</p>
<p>(2) Other matters are written on it.</p>
<p>(3) The handwriting is illegible.</p>
<p>(4) Voting paper not issued is used.</p>
<p>(4) The polling place official will stamp the voter's certificate with a small stamp that says "Shanghai Municipal Councilor Election Ballot Voted".</p>
<p>(5) After voting, immediately exit the polling place. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Save Guangxi: 300 Li of No Man's Land on the Guibei Highway, 13 Million People Crying for Food</h3>
<p>— A special airmail dispatch of the day, sent by our special correspondent Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>As I pick up my pen, I cannot help but feel a pang of sadness. With tears in my eyes, I want my compatriots to also see this human hell that is Guangxi Province!</p>
<p>The disaster in Guangxi, when no one mentions it, seems like a calm curtain. Once it is lifted, inside are refugees struggling for their last breath, mixed in piles of corpses, crying to the heavens and dying with resentment. Along the 300 kilometers of highway from Quan County to Lingchuan in northern Guangxi, there is no trace of human life. On the plateau from Yishan to Xiuren, the death rate is extremely high. Who could see it without shedding tears or hear of it without feeling heartbroken? Save us! Save the lives of millions! What internal war are you fighting? What benevolence and righteousness are you pretending? Let the government use military funds to save the innocent people who should not die! God!</p>
<p>More Than a Year of Major Battles, Civilian Food Completely Plundered</p>
<p>This is how the great famine came about: During the occupation, this was a military stronghold for major battles, so the enemy often had one or two divisions stationed here for more than a year. Civilian food was completely plundered. In addition, the heroic resistance of the self-defense forces increased the enemy's hatred, so they plundered everything down to the last blade of grass. By the time of the counter-offensive, the large army entered Guangxi and gathered in northern Guangxi. The logistical supply was enormous, coupled with the back-and-forth battles, the terrible drought, and the epidemic, so when the province was liberated, northern Guangxi was completely devastated.</p>
<p>Making Battered Cakes from Bran and Husks, Resulting in One Death Per Cake</p>
<p>Refugees who had fled to the mountains returned to their hometowns. From the moment they stepped into the county, they became acquainted with eleven things that even dogs wouldn't eat: fern roots, kudzu roots, Smilax glabra, hay vegetables, scissor vegetables, earth mushrooms, banana roots, palm tree tops, wild taro roots, grass roots, and rice bran. Initially, they dug out the starch in the fern roots to satisfy their hunger. Later, they even used bark to grind into flour and mixed it with bran to make "battered cakes" to fill their stomachs. Alas, this is not food for humans! So, eating one results in one death. This has continued until today, and it is almost over. There are even villages that appear complete on the outside, but inside, the entire village has either died or fled. Villages that had been battlefields are lucky to have even four-tenths of their population remaining. Every day before dawn, the undead form teams and go up the mountain to collect the above-mentioned food, leaving the old, weak, and children at home. It is often heard that by the time they return home with the wild vegetables, several members of the family have already died stiff.</p>
<p>Starving People Lie in Tatters, Eating Straw from Pillows to Survive</p>
<p>Let me cite some more common tragedies. For example, in Xianshui Che Tian Village in Quan County, a man named Wang, unable to eat after exhausting his food supply, lay in tattered cotton wadding, eating straw from his pillow to fill his hunger, but still died. Another incident occurred in Zhuwan Village, Huangsha River. A woman named Huang had two young children. Because they had been hungry for two days and had nothing to eat, they cried and cried for food. The mother, unable to find a solution, made two mud cakes and哄骗了小孩子说，便用泥做成粑粑兩個, saying to the children, "Put them in the fire to bake, and you can eat them when they're cooked." The two children were overjoyed and squatted together by the brazier, waiting for the mud cakes to cook. But their mother hanged herself before the mud cakes were cooked! The mud cakes will never cook! Writing this, I can't hold back my tears any longer!</p>
<p>Petitioning in Guilin, People Surround the Mayor and Plead</p>
<p>The people of Lingchuan County went to Guilin to petition because the mayor of Guilin was from Lingchuan County. So the representatives surrounded Mayor Su all day long, crying and asking him to find a solution. Mayor Su sighed and said to the representatives of Lingchuan, "I know you are suffering, but you should also look at the people of Guilin!" Indeed, three or two corpses are found in the outskirts of Guilin every day. People who have suffered extreme hunger hear that people who died during the Battle of Guilin had a lot of money on them, so they rush to dig up graves and exhume corpses. The threat of the death penalty is too common for them. Any way of dying is the same; it is enough to live one more day.</p>
<p>The Deputy Director Suffers</p>
<p>Xie Guanyi, the deputy director of the relief sub-office, and Wei Jingchu, the director of the joint management office of the provincial government, had inspected the vast disaster area and brought back two "battered cakes" made of kudzu roots and bran. They were green and black in color and had a fishy and pungent smell that made people want to vomit. It is hard to believe that the disaster victims fill their stomachs with these things. Alas, what era is this? Why do our compatriots have to suffer so much? Deputy Director Xie and others had personally tasted a bite of these "battered cakes" but immediately spat them out.</p>
<p>Even Though Land Prices Plummet, Who Wants This Barren Land?</p>
<p>There is also such a tragic thing: because spring has come, fern roots are starting to sprout. Once they sprout, there is nothing left to eat, not even ferns. What do refugees want spring for?</p>
<p>In the disaster area, there were initially some unscrupulous people offering unprecedentedly high-interest loans. For every 10,000 yuan borrowed, two dan of grain had to be paid in interest in addition to the principal at harvest time. Many tenant farmers gritted their teeth and borrowed, preparing to cut flesh to heal sores in the fall. But now, no one is willing to lend even such blood money. So, people with land are selling an acre of land for one dan of grain, or even half a dan. But who wants this barren land?</p>
<p>Two Thousand Tons of Flour, Less Than Six Liang Distributed to Each Person</p>
<p>The call for relief with blood and tears is weakly echoing in all directions. When the deputy director of the relief sub-office arrived in the disaster area, a starving farmer looked痴痴 at the deputy director, pointed to his belly, and tears flowed like rain. Everyone who went with him cried. Then the farmer quietly rested in peace.</p>
<p>A small portion of the 2,000 tons of flour has been shipped to Guilin, but all 13 million people in Guangxi are starving. 2,000 tons is not even six liang per person. Besides the 2,000 tons, there is nothing else. We want to protest to the Relief Administration and beg the Relief Administration for help with tears!</p>
<p>The people of Guangxi have done nothing wrong. They did not destroy the railways, nor did they attack cities. They do not put on a show. On the contrary, they have exerted much effort and suffered much misery in many wars. Today, they have only reaped an unprecedented great death. Everyone's heart is filled with indescribable grievance. To win back people's hearts, do not be biased, and even more so, do not be indifferent. Because the children of Guangxi are also the flesh and blood of China, please reach out and save Guangxi! (April 1)</p>

<h3>Shen Honglie Discusses Zhejiang's Policies: Emphasis on Primary and Secondary Education; Criticizes Students for Knowing Only Theory and Not Application</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Special Dispatch] The newly appointed Chairman of Zhejiang Province, Shen Honglie, discussing Zhejiang's policies, emphasized the importance of education, especially primary and secondary education. He stated that national education within education is even more important. He emphasized both quality and quantity; quality and quantity must be given equal importance. The intellectual level of the people of Zhejiang is relatively high. This is the result of the Zhejiang authorities' past emphasis on education and the achievement of their educational efforts. Adult remedial education and social education are equally important and are essential conditions for consolidating grassroots politics. In addition, there is training, because those who come out of school only know theory and do not know how to apply it. Therefore, they must be trained before they can use what they have learned, and learning and application must be connected so that they can contribute practically to society. The importance of training lies here. (Butterfly)</p>
<h3>Zhang Boling Undergoing Medical Treatment in the United States, Will Celebrate His Seventieth Birthday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 17th Dispatch] Zhang Boling, the president of Nankai University, underwent surgery at a hospital here this afternoon. It is said that the procedure went very well. Zhang originally hoped to arrive here on April 5 to celebrate his seventieth birthday, but due to transportation difficulties, he was unable to arrive as scheduled. The celebration is scheduled to be held on June 5. Teachers Insist on Supplementary Salary</p>
<h3>Issues Regarding the Resumption of Classes by Teachers in Peiping: Actively Seeking a Reasonable Solution; Teachers Insist on Supplementary Salary</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Peiping] The全体请假事发生事 of all teachers in Peiping's municipal primary and secondary schools has lasted for many days. Although the municipal government is seeking a reasonable solution, due to the real financial difficulties of the local government, it must find a way to obtain funds from the central government. Therefore, Director Ying of the Education Bureau reported the situation to Mayor Xiong. The main points of the report were: (1) Teachers really cannot make a living; (2) Peiping's educational funds have historically been subsidized by the central government, which has precedents; (3) Why is the treatment of central government agencies in the same city several times different? (4) Diligent and pure; (5) This is the lowest reasonable demand. Xiong immediately telegraphed the central government accordingly and hoped that the teachers could take a broader view, prioritize education, and resume classes first. A few days ago, Xiong took the opportunity of the municipal administration meeting to invite Director Wu of the Municipal Party Committee and others to attend the discussion of solutions. The results were divided into two methods: symptomatic treatment and fundamental treatment. The symptomatic treatment involves requesting the Good and Save General Administration to distribute a bag of flour to each person first. The fundamental solution is for the municipal government and the Education Bureau to send personnel to the central government for instructions. If necessary, teacher representatives will also participate, requesting three points: (1) Increase the base salary; (2) Equal treatment for public school personnel; (3) Determine Peiping's educational funds, hoping to resume classes as soon as possible. The executive committee of the Teachers' Association stated that if the salaries currently paid by primary and secondary schools are in accordance with central standards, each person should be supplemented with more than 50,000 yuan for February and March. If the authorities can find a way to issue this amount, they can consider resuming classes. For salaries after April, they asked the central government to guarantee that they would be issued in accordance with the promulgated standards. If each person only receives a bag of flour, it is absolutely impossible to resume classes.</p>
<h3>Eight Institutes of the Academia Sinica Will Move to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Special Commissioner Wu Xuezhou of the Academia Sinica stated that the Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences and the Institute of Engineering Experimentation have now been taken over. Most of the machinery and instruments stored in the Institute of Engineering Experimentation before the war have been lost and are now being numbered and sorted. The general office of the Academy will soon move back to the capital from Chongqing. Of the fourteen affiliated scientific research institutes, except for the six institutes of Geology, Astronomy, Meteorology, History, Language, and Society, which will remain in the capital, the remaining eight institutes of Mathematics, Physics, Algebra, Zoology and Botany, Psychology, Medicine, Physical Anthropology, and Engineering will all move to Shanghai. The first batch of 30 staff members has arrived in Shanghai and is actively carrying out reorganization work. If transportation and the environment permit, they can all be moved back by the end of July this year. It was also reported that President Zhu Jiahao召築召築家 arrived in Shanghai and summoned all staff members of the Academy yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock to discuss restoration matters, and individually met with Wu Xuezhou, Ding Ling, and other persons in charge of various research institutes to inquire about matters.</p>
<h3>Three Thousand Pictographs, Only Six Hundred Recognized</h3>
<p>American Educators Criticize the Japanese</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, St. Louis, 17th Dispatch] Recently, 28 American educators were invited by General MacArthur to examine education in Japan in March. Two of these 28 people were Minister Stanley of the Department of Education and Professor Lian Zhi of Columbia Teachers College. According to reports from the St. Louis Courier-Post, the Japanese boast that they are the most culturally advanced country, which is not true. This boast is based on the principle that every Japanese has received elementary education. In fact, they only know about 600 of the 3,000 pictographs. Therefore, only 15% of the Japanese can read newspapers.</p>
<h3>Tao Xingzhi to Give a Public Lecture</h3>
<p>[Ta Kung Pao News] Since social educator Tao Xingzhi arrived in Shanghai, requests for lectures have been continuous.

The topic is "Democratic Education and Democratic Life."</p>
<h3>Activities of Students Studying in the UK</h3>
<p>Preparing for Summer Meeting to Promote Contact Among Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 18th Dispatch] The London Chinese Students Association in the UK is preparing for a summer meeting, scheduled to be held in Sheffield from August 2 for one week. In the past year, the number of Chinese students studying in the UK has more than doubled, so the Association is making every effort to promote its activities. There are very few female Chinese students in the UK. The Association has issued invitations to encourage them to attend on time and participate in the event.

<h3>Cheng Shi煃 Reports to the Ministry: General Situation of Education in Jiangxi Province; Relief Administration Allocates 200 Million Yuan to Repair School Buildings; 100 Million Yuan Self-Raised for European and American Study Fund</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Special Dispatch] Jiangxi Education Director Cheng Shi煃, invited by the Ministry of Education, attended a meeting at the Ministry from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm on the 17th to discuss the rehabilitation of education in Jiangxi Province. Deputy Minister of Education and relevant directors and section chiefs, and Director Cheng, etc. attended. Deputy Minister Hang Liwu presided. First, Director Cheng Shi煃 reported on the losses of education and culture in the province during the war and the post-war rehabilitation of education at all levels and the raising of additional funds. The general situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Wartime Losses</p>
<p>The direct and indirect losses of education and culture in Jiangxi Province during the war amounted to 970 billion yuan. The losses were severe. Now, when rehabilitation is underway and national education is being promoted, the repair and equipment of primary school buildings are particularly urgent. The Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has approved an allocation of 200 billion yuan for the construction of more than 200 primary school buildings in various parts of Jiangxi Province and the addition of desks and chairs, with funds allocated in three phases.</p>
<p>Education at All Levels</p>
<p>In Jiangxi Province, there were more than 18,000 primary schools before the war. Now there are more than 19,000 schools, and the number of students has increased from 860,000 to more than 1.1 million. There were 73 secondary, normal, and vocational schools before the war, with more than 15,000 students. Now there are 245 schools, with more than 64,000 students. Most of the independent mass schools in "Social Education" before the war have now been changed to affiliates of the National Schools' Ministry of People's Education. There are now 5,934 purely social education institutions and mass schools. There were three colleges and universities before the war, which has now increased to five. The province has also specially appropriated 100 million yuan as a study fund, preparing to send students to study in Europe and the United States this year.</p>
<p>Discussion Opinions</p>
<p>The schools in Jiangxi Province were moved inland and changed to national schools. There are now four schools that have returned to the provincial level. The method of restoration was also discussed and a decision was made. The Ministry of Education deeply appreciated the efforts and progress of education in Zhejiang Province, especially the wide use of materials and the use of materials obtained from dismantling air-raid shelters to subsidize the repair of school buildings, which saved the government a lot of expenses. Deputy Minister Hang and the attending director and section chief gave many instructions on the future direction of education at all levels in the province. (Fool)</p>

<h3>Sichuan University: Growing Up in the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Jing Ming</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, the situation in Sichuan's education sector was as chaotic as Sichuan's political situation. Apart from the West China University, founded by the church, higher education in Sichuan really could not be said to have any standing in the domestic education scene. However, we must know that Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," has a population of over sixty million, with abundant agricultural products and mineral resources, making it our bulwark against imperialist aggression. Under the heavy pressure of Japanese aggression, the National Government recognized that aggression could not be stopped without national defense construction, and there could be no national defense without the construction of the Southwest. Thus, in the 23rd year, the Staff Corps entered Sichuan, and there was officer training in Emei. Sichuan University had already been formed at this time through the merger of Normal University, Chengdu University, Public Sichuan University, and the Chinese Academy. It was established in 1931, with Mr. Wang Zhaorong as the president at the time. President Wang maintained the university's affairs during the defense zone era, and although he put in a lot of effort, the university's foundation was still very fragile and could not withstand any storms. The year after the Staff Corps entered Sichuan, the situation in Sichuan was unified under the leadership of Liu Fucheng. The central government decided to carry out development, building Sichuan into the final base for national defense. To cooperate with this construction, the urgent need for talent gave Sichuan University an opportunity to develop. In August of that year, President Wang resigned, and the central government appointed Mr. Ren Hongjun, a renowned domestic educator, to succeed him, and also merged the Sichuan Provincial College of Education into Sichuan University. President Ren can be said to be the second great contributor to Sichuan University. With foresight, he recognized that the Imperial City was located in the city center, which was not suitable for running a school. He reached an agreement with the Sichuan Provincial Government to give the Imperial City campus to the provincial government, which in turn allocated 2,000 mu of land near Wangjianglou to Sichuan University in exchange as a new campus. This plan received strong support from the central government, which further allocated 2.63 million national currency as a special fund for the construction of new school buildings, and appointed Weng Wenhao, Zhou Yichun, Tingfu, Li Ji, and Ren Hongjun to form the Construction Committee.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Chengdu knows that Wangjianglou is a scenic area in Chengdu. The Jinjiang River encloses this area into a semi-circular shape. Standing on the magnificent and sturdy Jiuyan Bridge, one can see sailboats like , willow trees lining the road, and green trees and white clouds reflecting each other. There are relics of the famous Tang Dynasty courtesan , and the Wangjianglou is covered with glazed tiles. According to local historians, Zhang Xianzhong buried hundreds of millions of taels of silver in the Zhuojin River during his rebellion in Sichuan.</p>
<p>The first phase of the school building project started in July 1937, just before the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Magnificent buildings were built one after another amidst the nationwide artillery fire. Unfortunately, shortly after the construction of the school buildings began, President Ren resigned for some reason. Mr. Zhang Yi acted as the agent for school affairs until Mr. Cheng Tianfang was sent by the central government to take over in the winter of 1938. By the spring of 1939, prices began to rise, and the construction project was invisibly brought to a standstill. In addition, the bombing range of enemy planes had penetrated deep into Chengdu. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, President Cheng decided to move the school to Emei in the summer of that year. At this time, the completed school buildings included a library building, a mathematics and physics building, a chemistry building, one completed student dormitory building, one foundation laid, and five exquisite faculty residences, less than one-fifth of the original construction plan.

The market remained flat at noon.

The US dollar was advancing without retreat, fueling the buying sentiment for gold. People's hearts, due to the current situation, had a latent upward trend, gradually rising above the Central Bank of China's allocation price (registration time has passed), reaching a high price of 1.61 million.

<h3>Public Bonds Have Slight Activity: Chinese Stocks Still Can't Escape Downturn</h3>
<p>Black Market on Renji Road Raided</p>
<p>Official prices are still not disclosed. Apart from Unified C, there is a small amount of liquidity, while miscellaneous bonds still lack movement. Unified C initially rose to around 5,700 yuan, then fell back to around 5,300 yuan, and finally hovered around 5,350 yuan, falling back 170 yuan compared to the previous close. Police patrols were even stricter on Chinese stocks yesterday. Baichang, far away on Renji Road, was also raided by the authorities. The declining trend has become more severe, and they were even more fatigued yesterday. After opening, they briefly rebounded, with Yongsha at 500 yuan, Meiya at 4,200 yuan, and Jingfu at 433 yuan.

<h3>US Cotton Soars: Local Cotton Trade Stalls; Cotton Merchants Hoard and Raise Prices</h3>

The local spot cotton trade has completely stalled. Due to the潔风戰of US cotton, cotton merchants are thinking of looking high. Those who hold goods mostly reside in哥, and the price increases are quite high, making negotiations difficult to approach. Textile mills and private yarn factories are all waiting and watching, with no transactions at all, presenting a situation of "having a market but no transactions."</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Has Entered a Consolidated Phase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw both ups and downs. Large factory goods,同行, intentionally sought to sell, but the Cantonese帮 had little appetite. Therefore, Zhengma Small Two Thousand, 20-count 牌 and 16-count yarns continued to be good by 5,000 to 15,000 yuan because there were buyers for the内帮. There is not much spot goods. The yarn market has temporarily entered a consolidation phase, and people's hearts are quite stable. Yesterday afternoon, the 舫建公司's scheduled opening of yarn prices again arrived. 8-count and 10-count组纱 were slightly raised by 20,000, and fine yarns above 32-count were slightly raised by 10,000 to 50,000. The commonly needed 20-count yarns on the market are still available for sale.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Sluggish</h3>
<p>The coal market, tobacco leaves, and other goods are still sluggish due to配給of coal and　with coal同業 as well, and the prices are even cheaper than　coal, so the trend is still not good, the mood is较盧, and prices are　. The situation of early coal承前continues to be sluggish. However, because shipments are still湧, real sales show no sign of picking up, so the market returns to盤小. The current market price of firewood and charcoal has already reached a point where there is no profit to be made, so most客帮have　changed to other秦. Shipments are normal, and although the market has not seen continued weakness, the situation is still渡. Coal balls, since the various mechanized coal ball factories have been配得 by鸿基　, will now start transporting coal斤and can resume supply. It is heard that the large coal ball factory has internally定问业批发at 150,000 to 160,000 yuan, and retail at 9,000 yuan per load, with a higher quality than other goods on the market, but the market price is also higher.</p>

<h3>Arrivals Have Not Decreased: Rice Prices Rise Sharply and Fall Slightly; Authorities Decide to Severely Punish Speculative Activities</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market had normal digestion. Japonica rice兴by 1,000 yuan, and Indica rice元米both by slightly over 1,000 yuan. The closing price showed a slightly stable situation. Flour continued to rise by 200 yuan due to active零. The oil market had strong arrivals, surged in the early market, and stores took slightly at noon, gradually rising.

The types and shi numbers are as follows: White粳3,642 shi, Du秈930 shi, Sheep油300 shi, Early rice 944 shi, 薄rice 969 shi, White元20 shi. Also, it is reported that the price of grain in Shanghai has risen by about 8,000 yuan per market stone in recent days. The special commissioner's office of the grain administration sent special commissioners to the rice and grain market to investigate the truth. It is claimed that the source of grain has not decreased in recent days. The main reason for this rebound is that speculators, seeing that there is no opportunity to enter the gold and silver market, have mostly turned to grain greed, believing that when grain is released, grain merchants will surely rush to buy, so they compete to buy in团 and sell at a high profit. It is heard that after reporting to the department, the grain administration has consulted with the authorities　to severely punish this type of speculation. In summary, since the 12th of this month, there has been no significant change in the source of rice and grain, but the price of grain has actually risen by as much as 30%. It is very obvious that this is投机捣乱. The daily grain price and the number of rice arrivals for the week from the 12th to the 18th are listed below: (Rice price is based on white粳)</p>
<p>Date Rice Price Rice Arrivals (Shi)</p>
<p>12 26,000 8,673</p>

<p>18 33,500 6,322</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Mayor　 convened a meeting of relevant parties yesterday to discuss ways to suppress rice prices and crack down on speculation. It is heard that concrete decisions have been made on both治本and治標, and a strict investigation has been conducted on whether rice merchants who have obtained loans have gone to production areas to purchase. At the same time, in order to facilitate transportation, the two railway bureaus have been negotiated to allocate篷車specifically for the purpose of transporting rice. A monitoring method will be adopted for rice market transactions. If outsiders or中人are found to be raising prices or hoarding, they will be severely punished.

<h3>Asphalt Sales Sluggish: 客货 Ask Prices Often Do Not Follow Official Market</h3>
<p>Asphalt has not seen whole transactions for two weeks. The sluggishness of the market can be imagined, because the candle sales market is now in the off-season, and soap production is also delayed due to the unpredictable weather. Manufacturers are観望and rarely have buying intent. However,客货continues to arrive. The negotiated prices of both parties do not match. Although there are many who wait for the time to sell, there are also quite a few who are eager to sell, so even if there are prices offered recently, they do not follow the official market. The selling prices of each line have gradually decreased, with Heben at 56,000 yuan, Neiping at 47,000 to 48,000 yuan, Duzhu at 40,000 yuan, and Lanyou at 37,000 yuan.</p>

A small amount of客货 initially opened at 46,000 yuan, and later also reached 49,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan. Other goods were also tightened.</p>
<h3>New Tea Market Firm: Old Tea Still Has No Buyers</h3>
<p>After inspecting four or five batches of new Longjing tea, the arrivals from the Wenhang production areas are still coming in an endless stream. However, the sellers are unwilling to easily part with their goods, so the underlying market is strongly supported. For old tea花色, some sellers are eager for cash and are still loosening their grip, while buyers are still looking down on the future of selling prices. Furthermore, due to the sluggish digestion in Tianjin and other places, their appetite is even worse. The situation is in a state of more spitting and less absorbing, with no improvement to speak of. Top Qimen and other teas are even fatigued with no buyers.</p>
<h3>United Nations to Convene: World Food Conference</h3>

<h3>Fake Currency Registration Problem</h3>
<p>Special Commissioner Cables Department for Instructions: Difficult to Start on Monday</p>
<p>Regarding the problem of registering fake currencies after the deadline for exchange, the Central Bank of China's Issuance Bureau originally intended to start handling this matter on下呈期一, with registration at various locations. Now it is learned that this matter will be temporarily suspended because the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance is still　requesting the Ministry of Finance to review the following four issues, the crux of which is: (1) The number of exchanges in the past is very close to the total amount of发行发行by the fake "Central Reserve Bank of China"; (2) For one type of fake currency, such as 5,000 yuan or 1,000 yuan, the number of exchanges often exceeds the total number of发行发行; (3) Although the Ministry of Finance cabled instructions on the method of registering fake currencies, there are only about ten days left before the end of the month, and it is difficult to complete the registration thoroughly; (4) Most of the fake currencies that have not yet been exchanged in various places are in remote rural areas, and if the exchange institutions are limited to four banks and two bureaus, the villagers will inevitably lose money on transportation costs in order to register, and holders of small amounts of僑券will feel that it is not worth the loss. In summary, if it is desired to register and exchange all of the fake currencies, the only feasible way is to not set a deadline and exchange them forever. The Special Commissioner's Office is currently submitting this matter to the Ministry for review, and it will be handled in accordance with the instructions as soon as a reply is received.</p>

Also, due to a shortage of skilled workers, the price of fine diamonds has increased more than that of rough gems. At the same time, the price increase of small diamonds is even more significant. Since the diamond industry in Antwerp and Amsterdam resumed operations at the beginning of last year, the number of diamond workers worldwide has more than doubled. Since October of last year, the average production volume of fine diamonds has exceeded a value of one million pounds and is continuing to increase. The majority of processed gems produced worldwide are shipped to the United States, where appetite remains strong. However, due to abundant supply, especially small diamonds, prices are tending to fall. As a result, the appetite for fine diamonds may stagnate. At the same time, the United States has abundant inventories of rough gems, and the quantity of purchases for组gems will inevitably decrease accordingly.</p>

<h3>Reading "A New Theory of the Chinese Nation"</h3>
<p>— Mu Lei</p>
<p>Publisher: The Commercial Press Author: Zang Bojing</p>
<p>The Chinese nation, after eight years of arduous struggle, has defeated the leading aggressor in East Asia and honorably ranks among the world's five great powers. Through this long-term resistance, the Chinese nation has experienced countless hardships, but ultimately achieved the fruits of final victory. The resilience and greatness of the Chinese nation have long been evident to the world. Every Chinese son and daughter, filled with joy, feels that their national spirit is truly precious.</p>
<p>Today, many citizens hope to clearly understand the greatness of their own national character and to comprehend the characteristics of their own nationality. However, specialized books discussing national issues are still scarce. Recently, I spent two evenings reading Zang Bojing's "A New Theory of the Chinese Nation," and I deeply feel that this book is urgently needed at this time. This is a popular book discussing the essential issues of the Chinese nation. Every citizen who hopes to have a correct understanding of this important issue, which is closely related to national issues, should read it.</p>
<p>This book takes a biological perspective and incorporates various modern thoughts, national philosophy, and educational philosophy as its basis. Although, as the author says, it is not a creation or an invention, the thorough collection of materials and the unique elaboration of national issues show the author's efforts. In this book, the author systematically explains why the Chinese nation suffered this serious foreign invasion, from the weaknesses of the nation to the latent great national spirit, which is the main factor for the victory of the war of resistance, and determines the future path of the Chinese nation's revival.</p>
<p>Reading the first chapter, "Introduction," makes us understand that this Sino-Japanese War is the largest, longest, and most extensive foreign invasion war in the five-thousand-year history of our Chinese nation. What distinguishes it from past foreign wars is that the foreign races that invaded in the past were culturally inferior to us, and over time, they were gradually assimilated by our country. However, this time, the strong enemy Japan has more developed education and culture than us, more abundant military equipment, and is cunning and insidious, using all means. To defeat them, we must first restore national self-confidence, seek regeneration through our own efforts, and not only hope for the prosperity and revival of China, but also share the responsibility of building a new world in the future. The author emphasizes that this war is a positive turning point for our country, encouraging the people to strive for strength and revive what has declined. It also explains from historical examples that national character is by no means immutable. Our nation certainly has its greatness, and as long as it can transform the weaknesses of national character, it can occupy a pivotal position in the large group war against aggression.</p>
<p>Chapter Two, "The Meaning of Nation," explains that the fate of the nation determines the fate of the individual, and also describes the relationship between nation and race, language, land, country, and history. All ethnic groups belonging to the Chinese nation must uphold the principle of mutual dependence, unite in spirit, defend the independence of the nation, and promote and maintain excellent national traditions, support the leader who led the war of resistance, and inspire the national spirit of the workers.</p>
<p>Chapter Three, "The Formation of a Nation," discusses the formation of personal character, the formation of national character, and the quality and quantity of the nation, believing that the quality of a nation's talents does affect its rise and fall, but excellence without numbers is also a flaw, which is a general discussion. In Chapter Four, "The Formation of the Chinese Nation," it is necessary to further describe the inheritance of the Chinese nation from the perspective of eugenics, and to analyze the rich natural resources of the Chinese nation from the natural environment and the man-made environment, but unfortunately, scientific methods have not been used to fully utilize them. Finally, it also talks about the current decline of the Chinese nation, and the result of poor education and the decline of national character, and believes that only by vigorously implementing national education can the Chinese nation be revived.</p>
<p>Then, in Chapter Five, "The National Character of the Chinese Nation," it explains the relationship between national destiny and national character, and the formation of national character. It also speaks in detail about the characteristics of the Chinese nation. The author quotes the American missionary Arthur Smith's analysis of fifteen points of our national character: (1) Chinese people who are easy to live and difficult to die. (2) Chinese people without nerves. (3) Chinese people with too much patience. (4) Chinese people who do not seek accuracy. (5) Chinese people who do not compete for every inch of time. (6) Industrious Chinese people. (7) Frugal Chinese people. (8) Chinese people who are content and happy. (9) Selfish and self-interested Chinese people. (10) Chinese people without compassion. (11) Chinese people who do not keep their word. (12) Chinese people who deceive each other. (13) Chinese people who love face. (14) Evasive Chinese people. (15) Polite Chinese people. This observation is purely the subjective view of foreigners, and is written by comparing the character of our people with that of foreigners, especially Americans, and at most, it can show the obvious differences in the character of our people and Americans. We must adopt the attitude of learning from others' strengths to make up for our weaknesses. The author also proposes the point of spiritual transformation, hoping that the social pioneers who change customs and habits will rise up and advocate it.</p>
<p>In order to emphasize the reform of the nation, the author takes the example of the Franco-Prussian War, and in Chapter Six, "How to Reform National Character," discusses it in detail, explaining the fact that Fichte's fourteen public speeches awakened the national spirit and self-confidence of all Germans, and compares it with this Sino-Japanese War, to boost our entire nation's confidence in the victory of the war of resistance, which is a very powerful chapter.</p>
<p>The author believes that strengthening national consciousness and promoting national spirit must start from education. The education of a country determines the rise and fall of a nation. The author proposes three stages of national spirit development: the first stage is formed by elements such as race, environment, and population, which is the national character of ancient times. The second stage is the reaction of politics, religious thought, and literature created by the nation to the nation itself, which creates a national character, and the national character of modern times mostly belongs to this stage. The third stage is to use the ideal of freedom, free choice, and establish an education system suitable for the survival of the nation within the social organization, and then create an ideal national character, national spirit, and integrity based on the education system, which is the goal that all countries in the modern world are moving towards. Regarding these issues, the author specially lists a chapter on "The Chinese Nation and New Education" to elaborate on the theory of national education. Education cannot transcend time and space and be built on abstract theory, but must take into account the needs of the nation and the country. The author also reviews the shortcomings of our past education, and expresses his opinions on political education, personality education, military education, normal school education, and genius education. One section is "National Revival and Women's Education," and the points raised are extremely pertinent. From the relationship between women and national survival, the types of women in various countries around the world, and the source of the diseases of new women in our country, it indicates the awakening that women in our country should have in the future.</p>
<p>When writing this book, the enemy was launching its final violent attack, because it was on the eve of surrender, and when it was at the end of its rope, it did not hesitate to use its full strength to launch an offensive in an attempt to make a last-ditch effort. The author then took the real-world examples in Chapter Eight, "The Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Nation," to analyze the political and military situation of the authorities, and also touched on factors such as education and construction that could affect the war situation. The author believes that the greatest impact of this war on the nature of the nation is two: (1) National self-renewal. (2) A great mixture of national cultures. There is also a discussion of the improvement of the international status of the Chinese nation due to the war. From the Sino-Japanese War, it goes on to discuss the contribution of the Chinese nation to this world war. The Chinese nation has made indelible achievements for all mankind in this world war. In Chapter Nine, "The Chinese Nation and the World War," the author discusses in detail the power exerted by the Chinese nation from September 18th to the war against aggression, and finally states the understanding and efforts that the Chinese nation should have towards the world war. One section talks about the Three Principles of the People and the World Federation, explaining the world view of the Three Principles of the People and its great contribution to the future of world peace. The realization of the world of great harmony is the completion of the highest ideal of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Finally, in Chapter Ten, "Conclusion," it summarizes that the Chinese nation should grasp history, carry it forward, and use combat, self-confidence, and survival to wash away the great shame and humiliation of the nation, and then seek the completion of the world federal organization. The author recognizes that although there are many ways to revive the nation, it is necessary to practice it personally and strive from practice, so he loudly calls: "Practice first!"</p>
<p>"A New Theory of the Chinese Nation" is a new book that has been published not long ago, but when the manuscript was completed, the Japanese army had not yet surrendered, so it especially emphasized stimulating national self-confidence and promoting national spirit, with the purpose of strengthening the determination of the entire nation to strive for final victory. Now that the entire nation's war of resistance has achieved final victory, this book still has its value. In the process of nation-building, we also need to have a deep understanding of our own nation. I hope that readers can get powerful enlightenment about their own nation from this book.</p>

<h3>Reading Methods</h3>
<p>— Dongxin Compilation</p>
<p>Reading one foot is not as good as walking one inch. Being able to walk is being able to read. — Cheng Yi Chuan</p>
<p>When reading a book, be sure to summarize its words and seek the author's meaning. — Zhang Hong</p>
<p>Scholars reading books must put their minds to where it is tasteless. When doubts arise together, even forgetting sleep and food, then they can "advance suddenly." Therefore, I sigh that the two words "advance suddenly" are used best. It must be like this. If you only advance a little, or advance or retreat, as if existing or as if not, it will not help. It is like using soldiers to kill each other, fighting for some small territory, ten or twenty miles, it will not help. It must be a big fight to win well. The key to learning is also like this.</p>
<p>Now people read the text on one side and think about external matters on the other side, it is just a waste of effort. It is better to put down the text, wait until the mind is quiet, and then look at it. — Zhu Xi</p>

<h3>About "Collection of Chinese Famous Painters"</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>The several volumes of "Collection of Chinese Famous Painters" written in the year before the victory of the War of Resistance have recently been printed by the World Bookstore into three types: "Six Great Painters of the Early Qing Dynasty," "Four Great Painters of the Late Yuan Dynasty," and "Two Great Painters of the Jin and Tang Dynasties," and the new books have already arrived, which makes me feel infinitely gratified.</p>
<p>When I started writing this book, it was the summer vacation of the twenty-third year of the Republic (1934). At first, I just wanted to make a critical biography and chronology of the famous painter Wang Shigu from my hometown. Because during the War of Resistance, the research and promotion of local cultural relics could indirectly enhance national consciousness. However, in some ways, research and exploration of ancient culture is not necessarily an unprogressive escape from reality.</p>
<p>What are the lives and art of the great painters in history like? What are the inheritance, transmission, or influence of their styles? In many Chinese art history or painting history books, we are only given a rough outline. However, since they are called masters of a generation, how can their lives and art be so brief? …This idea has been lingering in my mind for a long time. The art system occupies an extremely important part. And it is really necessary to sort out the historical sites and art studies of the representative writers in a system. So after I completed "Wang Shigu," with the encouragement and sponsorship of friends, I continued to write the critical biographies and chronologies of fifteen masters of the early Qing Dynasty, the Ming Dynasty, the late Yuan Dynasty, and the Jin and Tang Dynasties.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing in studying Chinese painters is the problem of their birth and death years. For example, in Yuan Kaizhi's "Biography of Literary Garden in the Book of Jin," there is only "Died in office at the age of sixty-two." What year was he born? What year did he die? It became a problem. Another example is Huang Gongwang, Li Rihua said of him: "Over ninety years old, with blue eyes and red cheeks, …believing him to have become an immortal." Mei Shaoshu said: "Eighty-six years old, whereabouts unknown." Wang Chideng said: "Still alive during the Hongwu reign (1368–1398)." Furthermore, for Wang Meng, Qiu Ying, and other families, they did not write the date on their surviving works at all, and the years of birth and death are even more unclear.</p>
<p>The second difficulty is the lack of surviving works, and the evaluation of the art of each family can only rely on later generations' writings on painting. However, these writings, such as "Records of Famous Paintings of All Dynasties," "Illustrated Records of Paintings and Calligraphy," "Xuanhe Painting Catalogue," "National Dynasty Painting Records," etc., are very simple.</p>
<p>I did not stop working because of the difficulties. On the contrary, I gained an understanding of the doubts about the years of birth and death from circumstantial evidence, and after the commentary on the life deeds, I clearly listed the individual chronologies. Although there are bound to be errors in it, it can indeed unfold the life trajectory of each master, and at least we can get a possibly correct historical concept from it.</p>
<p>Regarding the discussion of the artistic styles of each family, my central theory still does not deviate from the established saying of "valuing the South and belittling the North." Because, literati art is the art of the scholar-official class, then the scholar-official art theories of Mo Yunqing, Dong Qichang and others are still applicable after all. As far as possible, I tried to avoid subjective, narrow, and extreme criticisms, and adopted objective and eclectic statements.</p>
<p>Artistic propositions and theories are often the center of a writer's style, so I introduced as much as possible a writer's painting theory and poetry as possible to help understand the writer's artistic style.</p>
<p>I hope that friends who read these books of mine will understand the difficulties in my writing, point out the places that should be revised, and correct them, so that they can reach a beautiful and good realm.</p>
