<h3>軍調部小組等待保障　展期赴安平調查　平美軍巡邏今晨赴津</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕關於安平區美軍被襲擊一事，共黨表示，目前正靜待北平所派特別小組之調查報告。</p>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕大小沙河美軍被襲擊事件。軍調部美方除同意派小組赴現地調查外，尚無任何表示，似在靜候駐華美軍及其外交當局之指示，顯示異常慎重。美記者對此則特別關心，蔡文治對此之聲明，聯合社一字不遺，完全柏出。共方以葉劍美名術有備忘錄致美方，大致與延安之廣播相同，大小沙河爲「解放區」，安平河西塢爲國共兩軍屢爭之地，對於所謂國軍聯合美軍一節，未有證據提出。記者以此詢及共產黨參謀長陳士渠，陳謂：俘獲之美軍卡車駕駛員爲證人，此外亦未有證據提出。共軍一醫官被俘事，陳謂無所聞，政府方面對此事則特別關心，三方同意派往調查之小組，原定三日出發，但未成行，據共方稱：其原因爲美方要求先由共方通知該地區共軍，亦即必先獲得小組人員之切實保障。另悉，國軍昨已進至該地區、且爲保障公路，將收復位於其旁之香河縣城。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津三日電〕據悉：駐津美軍當局對廿九日平津公路上美軍遭共軍襲擊時之情形，已有詳細調查，是日由津赴平之巡邏隊車輛，共有廿四輛，最前之四輛爲前哨車，由機槍吉普，通信吉普各一輛及自動槍吉普二輛組成，前哨車相當距離之後爲卡車十二輛，再後有陸軍吉普，行總卡車，巡邏車等八輛，首尾共長四百碼。前哨車行至安平境內大小沙河時，即爲預置於公路中之障礙物牛車所阻，該處公路之右前方，爲大小沙河村，有共軍之機槍，左前方小樹林亦有共軍之機槍，左後方爲玉米田，有共軍狙擊隊。右後方亦有共軍狙擊隊，共軍之指揮處，位於公路左側（柬面），美軍車輛爲障礙物所阻，甫行停馳後，即遭受共軍並無警告之襲擊，各方咸信此乃一有計劃行動。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平三日電〕此間美軍巡邏隊一隊計二百人，將於四日晨離平赴津，但鑒於上月廿九日被襲事件，將携充分配備，以防不測。該隊美兵將携中型戰車四輛及其他車輛三十輛，內中將包括無綫電吉普車二輛，無綫電卡車一輛，其餘卡車則分載美兵。全隊美兵備有機槍，自動武器及其他輕便武器多種，惟無大砲。</p>
<p>〔聯合社天津三日電〕此間美軍，自安平事件發生後，現正嚴密戒備，美軍駐紥處門首均布置鐵絲綱，以資防範，夜間則加崗駐守。</p>
<h3>月前迫降於陜北之機　經政府派機炸毀　因延安方面不肯交出故出此舉</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕關於共產黨延安廣播所稱昨日被炸一事，引起此間各方之注意。記者頃於雨夜十一時特走訪國防部陣參謀總長，陳氏適自勵志社宴請美海軍歸，以微感不適，業已休息，記者旋就名片背面書就問題，請其示知，旋即由其隨從參謀出告記者稱：總長對延安被炸之新聞，業已知悉，今日暫不作談話，政府方面將於明日發表公告。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京三日電〕空軍司令周至柔今日談稱：政府飛機昨。轟炸延安係爲毀滅六月二十六日飛往延安之B24聯炸機，且轟炸已獲成功。中共辦事處發言人宣稱：轟炸延安飛機七架，係由西安基地起飛，內有P47戰鬥機六架，係新近由南京來西安，餘一架爲B24轟炸機，計在延安上空，掃射並轟炸二十分鐘。據延安消息，各機曾向前飛往延安之B24轟炸機及共軍司令部投彈十一枚，一枚所落地點離共軍總司令朱德之辦公處只五百米，戰鬥機六架曾向軍事區域掃射，飛延安之政府B24轟炸機，中彈起火，已被焚毀。據周至柔稱：曾訓令轟炸延安空軍，將其目標集中於留在延安之政府轟炸機，並避免在延安其他各處轟作。在延安之政府轟炸機，係因汽油短少，被迫降落，前會要求將該機　還政府，迄已一月有餘，而所請卒未獲接受，故始派隊前往，將其炸毀。周恩來接獲延安被炸消息時，方與馬歇爾特使會談。延安正式消息，並未提及死傷數字，但據此間共方稱，死傷人數當不在少。中共發言人王炳南稱：此次延安被炸，因係突如其來，共軍未及預備。駐延安之美國聯絡官現有兩名，其中之一爲楊格少校。</p>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕葉劍英今致政府及美方備忘錄，說明昨有政府飛機七架轟炸並掃射延安計二十分鐘，投彈十一枚，槍彈萬餘發，前劉善本所駑之飛機，亦在延安機場彼炸燬，要求軍調部三方呈報三人會議。又共方否認共產黨有飛機。</p>
<h3>糧部電請各地協助　檢舉征實諸弊竇　列舉十項犯者立即法辦</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕本年田賦征實，業已開始，國府並頭明令，應切實防杜弊端，糧部遵將田賦征實，自征收儲運，以至配撥各階段，可能發生之弊　，擇要列舉十項，通飭所屬查察嚴禁，並電請各省市政府，各區監察使署，各省臨時參議會，各省高等法院，嚴密檢舉，以期圓滿達成征實任務。電文中列舉應行嚴辦事項如下：（一）征收征借，帶征公糧之數額，載明於各縣印發之根票，如有大頭小尾，或於糧票所載教額以外，浮派浮收者，（二）征收征借，帶征公糧之騐收，在以法定市制量器，或術器爲標準，如有以老斗或老秤浮收者，（三）征收征借帶征公糧，未經呈准，擅自折收價款者，（四）以劣殺掉換好　或私擅貸放或出售圖利者，（五）斗手秤手使用技巧浮收者，（六）虛報收敎或侵吞罰　者，（七）對納糧人留難需索者，（八）管倉經運人員監守自盜，摻雜摻水捏報損耗，損失或侵吞倉餘者，（九）提存集中費，運費遲延發放或尅扣敎額者，（十）父撥糧食使用，不合法之衡器量器或使用技巧營私者，上列十項，任犯其一，凡經查實，無論其人之地位如何，均應立即送交司法機關嚴辦，其有挾嫌誣告者，亦依法治罪。</p>
<h3>華府官方將發表聲明　重申美對華政策　薩凡奇稱決促成我國統一</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二日電〕代理國務鄕艾克遜本日聲稱；預料美官方不久將發表重申美國對華政策之聲明，對中國時局，作全面檢討。關於中國內部問題，彼避免提及，僅謂美海軍陸戰隊與共軍曾發生小衝突。記者詢艾氏對中國時局有何批評，艾氏曰：正式聲明不久即可發表，目前彼不願有所批評。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處舊金山二日電〕美國務卿帮薩凡奇，本日在此間聯邦總會稱：美國助華之步驟，旨在促成中國之統一，而非支持任何黨派之軍事集團，其演辭檢討美國外交政策之目標，由孤立政策至領導國際合作之轉變，以及聯合國之目標，渠稱：「建立一個更善之世界，乃一非常艱巨之工作，因而美國外交之任務，亦更加困難。各國在戰爭中，損失慘重之一國爲中國，即吾人太平洋對岸之善　與友國，吾人對中國人民，抱有深切之同情，彼等對殘忍之侵略者，會作英勇持久之抵抗，吾人希望彼等不久將獲致國內之和平統一。美國助華之各種行動，係實行一種旣定計劃之步骤，協助整個中國除去對日長期戰爭所遺下之影響，比等行動決不能視爲支持中國任何一黨之軍事集團，此等行動非三數月所能究成。共目的爲促成而非破襲統一，為鼓勵中國以和平協議之民主方法，解決其國內問題，而非採用軍事之武力。</p>

<h3>軍事挫折與民何尤　蘇北及冀北各處　共軍大規模決堤　冀境十二縣一片江洋　國軍搶修共軍竟出阻引起激戰</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕軍息：共軍在蘇北發動攻勢，遭受挫折後，竟需以最殘酷之政策，自七月三十一日以後，即開始其大規模之決堤行動。茲誌兩日來決堤情形如次：（一）徐州附近連河車站西南三公里處決堤，（二）海州西南八十五公里沭河綫新安鎮決口，長達一公里。（三）東海西南後沭河綫上坊街決口，（四）海州西南十六公里喬車決口。此四處堤防決口後，淹沒面積平均在二百至三百平方公里，如水勢續漲，面積將繼續漫展，人民死亡不計其數。記者茲以此事詢共產黨發，據稱：共產黨決無決堤之事，惟如係大堤決口或係雨水太多泛濫所致。</p>
<p>〔北報北平三日電〕保定電話：冀共車仍到處決堤，且與國軍演出搶修戰。據報：北運河九宣閘，永定河金門閘，被決堤水流四溢，獻縣子牙河，戚家橋子牙河兩堤被決，水淹文安·太城·雄縣·任邱四縣，據悉：滄縣六里之王希微莊西北堤被決後，國共兩軍正在　兒崗閘爲搶修而激戰，剪桿河堤被民衆憤而決漬，洪水流入共區，現永定河，南北運河，大淸河等搶修隊，均與共軍激戰中。共軍決堤目的，在孤立滄縣，截斷津浦北段交通。冀省府今日再電軍調部，請制止，同時派建設　長赴津滄視察督修。</p>

<h3>東北停用紅軍票後引起金融上紊亂　各同業公會提六項要求</h3>
<p>〔本報潘陽二日電〕東北收復各地，一日起停用百元紅軍票，引起金融上莫大之紊亂，刺激物宣告暫時停業，以觀究竟者頗多，人民間糾紛時起，一時手頭缺錢，無法應付開支及乏生活費者，比比皆是。一般人對於登記付十分之一以及登記期間如是之暫短，更表莫大之不滿，各同業公會會開俞討論此項問題，結果決　即向當局提出以下各項意見：（一）對八月一日以前各地方銀行向中央銀行所存之款項，不論其時所存者爲紅軍票抑爲流通劵，應按金額支兌流通劵。（二）因登記時按金額僅支紅軍票額十分之一，所餘十分之九作爲存款，並發給存單，希持有上項存單者，最低限度應按其存單票面額貸與十分之五以上之流通券，以期市面金融通暢。（三）按規定收兌登記銀行爲中中交農四國家銀行及商業銀行之益發，志成，商業，功成等行及其支行僅二十二處，按其收兌登記時日僅有十天，似嫌過少，故希望除增兌換處所外，並對收兌期設法延長。（四）對蘇聯承認發行之九七億元以外紅軍票，應由政府負損失之責，不使社會陷於不安狀態。（五）對現正募集之賑款及其他公款而存貯於經手人手中之紅軍票，應由政府予以考慮，免陷經手人於因境。（六）政府機關所課之稅收，最小限度在金額二分之一以上收納紅軍票。閒當局正對此加以研究中，各銀行辦理登記業務之人士，回憶民初對於俄人羌帖蒙受之損失，已不寒而慄，此次紅軍票對人民之損失，更爲慘烈，衆人對於僞滿鈔暫又視爲珍品，但另一方面知必將仍受一番之損失。調記者調查，僞滿鈔發行總額爲一三一億，有人估計毀者約一億以上，又加蓋杜長官印章，客冬臨時流通東北之法幣，已收回七億，所餘不足一億，年底可收回，發此蓋印法幣時，係與僞漢幣比值一對一也</p>
<h3>東北區海關暫先設五處</h3>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓二日合衆電〕聯總官員前稱：對華禁運，本週可能宣佈郃分解除者，現又稱：須待至下週聯總在日內瓦舉行理事會以後。織稱：此間官員希望能與在伯爾格來德之拉加第亞署長通消息，請其批准，解除聲明所作之努力，已因電訊交通困難而失敗，更因拉加第亞行踪不定，且聯總理事會短期內即將召開，故必需待至彼時，始得宣佈。並稱：該項宜佈，將以全世界情况之檢討爲根據，並將宣示聯總將採取何種行動。</p>

<h3>日本賠款與興復市政</h3>
<p>關於日本賠償問題，美國賠償專員鮑萊東來，調查了日本本土，朝鮮，及我東北等地的物資情形以後，已向美國國務卿貝爾納斯有所報告與建議。同時，聽說美國方面又向遠東委員會建議，重行擬議日本賠償的方案。我們相信，無論如何，鮑萊調查的結果，對於將來討論日本賠償數量及其分配額的決定，自有相當的貢獻，且可能作爲實施的重要依據。</p>
<p>我們中國受日本侵略最早，犧牲最大，將來向日本索取的賠償額當然也應最多。盟國處理賠償問題，據鮑萊在東京表示，其目的有二：一是撤廢日本軍需工業，以期獲得永久和平之保證；二是將日本軍需工業設施移交被侵略國，使之發展工業。這是在賠償被侵略國的損失之中，兼寓有消滅侵略奠定和平之意。目光遠大，我們深表贊同。我們以歷受日本長期侵略的敎訓，深知日本之所以甘冒天下之大不韙，悍然發動侵略戰爭，責由於我中國工業落後，國防力薄弱，致啓日本覬覦之心，而欲此後確保太平洋之和平，當以中國之富强爲其主要安定力。國內一般人士多主張以日本賠償的物資，用之於建立重工業，鞏固國防，以促進國家經濟之繁榮，保障世界和平之勝利，這意見與鮑萊所表示的兩個目的是相符合的。</p>
<p>但我們願在此指出一點，即是一般目光均着眼於國防及重工業方面，對於其他方面似不無忽略。醫如市政的興復便是其中一端。照我們的看法，建立重工業，鞏固國防，固是復興中國的最根本的要着，但日本在八年侵略戰爭中，對於我被侵佔的各大都市的市政建設，破壞不遺餘力，至今收復以後，因各項設備缺乏，興復不易，這於國家經濟未來的發展大有影響，實有向日本索取相當物資以資抵償的必要。我們以爲日本賠償物資似不應僅以軍需工業爲限。</p>
<p>回憶自七七戰事發生以後，日本的每一進攻，都以我國的各大都市爲目標。因爲都市是國家經濟的重心，佔據了都市，連帶的可以控制與這個都市有關係的地區；破壞了都市，也連帶的可使與這個都市有關係的地區受到嚴重的影響。即以上海爲例，日本當時佔據上海後，因爲上海在我國經濟上地位的特殊重要，其使我國經濟受到嚴重的損害，是不待說明的。其他各大都市被侵佔後，也隨其地位之重要性，發生了或大或小，使我國經濟受到損害的作用。幸我政府措置得宜，艱苦度此難關。現在，都市收復了，照理說，都市的重心作用也應回復到正常狀態了，但如被破壞的市政建設不克及時興復，則其所能發生的重心作用必大為削弱，其對於我國經濟損害的情形，仍未能完全清除。市政建設的興復，是都市經濟發展繁榮的關鍵；而都市經濟之發展與繁榮，可促使全國經濟之發展與繁榮，其關係之深，影響之大，實在不容忽視。</p>
<p>按賠償本義，甲方物資被乙方所破壞，應由乙方以同樣物資抵補。這個本義，在日本賠償問題上，應該也可適用，雖則為了消滅侵略永奠和平，我們不能不從撤廢日本軍需工業着眼。但我們原有之種種市政設備或物資，因受日本之侵略破壞，影響於國家經濟之發展，而此種設備或物資又爲日本國內所有者，則向之索取同物賠償，也是理所當然。以上海論，上海經日本長期之侵佔，原有之各項市政建設無不受其嚴重摧殘，尤以水，電，煤氣，電車，公共汽車，碼頭輪渡等等爲甚。諸種設備，或被破壞，或被刦掠，或任其敗壞，其損失之大，難於估計，都有事實可資證明。此種市政建設，不特爲民衆日常生活所必需，且關係於工商經濟之發展與繁榮，若不力圖興復，則上海地位之重要性勢將因之大减，全國經齊亦將蒙其大害。但興復這種建設之物資，國內非常缺乏，補充極感困難，而日本此項設備尚頗豐富，向其查明取償，以資抵補戰時損失，當非過分要求。上海獲行此類賠償後，四百萬市民固同受其利，而工商業之活躍也將因之倍增，對於促進國家富强，成爲太平洋和平之安定力，是一個大幫助。所以我們不憚詞費，在向日本索取賠償問題上，指出應注意興復市政這一點，正是有鑒於此。</p>
<p>對日遠東委員會，爲日本賠償問題，曾通過一個臨時報告，各個被侵略的國家即可提出要求賠償的申請。我們希望政府在提出此項申請時，於着眼國防及重工業等主要方面以外，還請注意於市政建設物資的索取，同時希望盟國於討論這個問題時也注意及此。因為這不僅有利於中國，且有利於世界和平的。</p>

<h3>和會表決制問題　成為大小國間爭執焦點　四強輪值主席表決通過</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎三日電〕南斯拉夫表示將要求取得否決權，以否決巴黎會議關於特里埃斯特之建議，此項要求同時牽涉特港問題及冬數表決權間題。紐西蘭·巴西·及荷蘭同時亦首次正式反對四强所建議之三分二大多數表決制，而主張採取簡單多數制。南斯拉夫認為關於國界問題之任何建議，若未得當事人盟國之同意，不能右效。蘇聯之態度如何，今日猶無表示。惟白俄羅斯代表基斯洛夫則表示贊成四强對特港之計劃，惟同時則稱，最後決議應以得以保護南斯拉夫民族之經濟及特殊利益爲原則。規程委員會之討論尚滯留於多數表決制之問題，預料英決美若堅決主張三分二之多數制，則該一辦法殊有成爲定識之可能，否則即極易採納簡單多數制，而危機之根源亦潛伏於是。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎三日電〕和會規程委員會今日以十二票對八票，通過支持由四强輪流擔任主席。表決時，阿比西尼亞代表未參加投票。美代表貝爾納斯曾宣稱，贊成由四强輪流擔任和會主席，蓋如因此問題而使裂痕擴大，則不獨使和會抑且使後將舉行之四國外長會議感受威脅。四强輸值主席得獲通過，實受貝氏此語影響。按照法文字母次序，第一任主席將由美國擔任，以後每隔三日再由法，英，蘇，三國任主席。辯論時，蘇外長莫洛托夫一再堅持，和會主席應由四强輪值，紐西蘭代表在荷蘭，巴西，澳大利亞·加拿大之支特下，竭力反對此議，並稱，法國乃主人國，應請其常任主席，以防免爭議。</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎二日電〕阿比西尼亞代表華爾特，今日在和會演說，要求以義大利東非屬地伊利特利亞與索瑪里蘭劃歸其版圖，據稱，各該殖民地係被義大利侵略榨取。在和會中對義屬地提出要求者當以此爲第一國。阿比西尼亞並希望自義大利獲得賠款。華爾特不顧四强會議商定義殖民地問題擱置一年之事實，竟然提出要求，殊非意料所及。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕印度事務部稱：新德里電台宣布，印度軍隊已自印調往巴斯拉，藉以保護英印及阿拉伯人之生命及伊朗南部英方之權益云云，共實其間並無英軍調赴伊朗之問題發生。本部原希望於宣佈軍隊之調動時，能設明此意</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敎二日電〕「紐約時報」記者稱：所謂退出埃及，不僅爲英陸軍之自埃撤退，即惡歷山大之海軍根據地，沙漠中之空軍基地，亦須一併故棄。巴勒斯坦可作爲陸海空三軍之新基地。巴勒斯坦之分治計劃，已在者慮之中，</p>
<p>尼傑勃區地位重要</p>
<p>該計劃擬使巴基斯坦南部之尼傑勃沙漠區，仍受英國控制。傳英國即擬在此建立中東最大之軍事根據地。英國前此於允許外約但獨立時，即已取得在該國駐軍之權利。英軍事領袖希望在尼勃建立軍事基地後，蘇彝士運河一旦遭受攻擊時，英軍仍可有即時出動之便利。英軍飛機自尼傑勃起飛一小時即可抵運河區二小時可抵開羅，不及三小時可抵報達。海發港可發展成第一級之軍港，而油田又近在咫尺，故尼傑勃實為最合理想之中東軍事根據地，英國與伊拉克之倏約，伊人雖欲修改，但料新約訂立以後，英軍仍不致喪失其在該國之地位，故英軍雖退出叙利亞及黎巴嫩，而伊拉克境之個軍，仍爲保護油田及運河之勁旅。</p>
<p>塞浦魯斯軍略必爭</p>
<p>除巴基斯坦伊拉克及外約但外，塞浦魯期馬亦爲英國控制地中海計劃之重要基地，該島東岸有良好之天然軍港，鳥之東部又爲一片平原，可供飛機昇降，就地勢上言，寒島扼愛琴海之入口，亦即等於黑海之門戶。自塞島爲北岸之基倫尼亞至土耳其僅四十五　，自該島東南岸之拉那加至貝魯軸僅二十　　自南岸至蘇　土運河，亦二百三十喱。在歷史上塞　　為阿拉伯，羅馬，法國，威尼斯，土耳其，及英人逐鹿之場，近代戰術之演進，並不減少塞島在軍事上之重要性。英國之　疑莫斯科染指，其故亦即在此。</p>

<h3>巴基斯坦分治計劃　杜魯門不予贊同　美代表團奉召回國　召開圓桌會議希望殊微</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕消息靈通方面謂，美總統不致贊成將巴勒斯坦分成二省二區之計劃，然官方宣示猶付缺如。艾德禮之行動自當視官方之宣示而定。聞英內閣定下週三召開特別會議，討論巴勒斯坦問題，屆時美總統之態度或已明白宣布，邱吉爾前建議將巴勒斯坦之委治移交聯合國機構，工黨議員亦不乏贊助此議者。下週三之閣議，當特別注意比事。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二日電〕在倫敦討論巴勒斯坦間題之美國代表團，因奉總統之緊急電召，乃於昨日忽忽回國。其原因或由於英閣在於星期三討論巴勒斯坦問題前，先得社魯門對巴勒斯坦劃分計劃之決議。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敎二日電〕權威方面息：阿拉伯國家中接受英政府之請柬，願意出席討論巴勒斯坦問題之會議者，已有外約但，沙地阿拉伯，叙利亞，黎巴嫩等四國，惟彼等均附有條件，即不願與猶太代表同桌會議，故圓桌會議舉行之希望，似頗淡薄，預料英政府或將採取個別交換意見之方式。</p>

<h3>不以武力解決爭端　世界始能獲安全　美發表原子彈二次試驗報告</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓二日電〕白宮本日發表社會門總統所獲關於七月廿五日比基尼島外第二次試騐原子彈水中爆炸之報告二件，其中一件警告稱：比基尼島少試騐顯示「世界如欲獲得安全，必須廢除以戰爭作爲解決國際爭端之方法」。此一報告來自總統之估計委員會，該委會由非軍人九名組成，包括現任麻省工藝研究院長原子能科學家康普登博士，由新墨西哥參議員哈　任主席。第二報告來自聯合參謀部之原子彈試騐估計委會，由海陸軍官及非軍人科學家等七人所組成以康普登爲主席。該二報告均指出一點：即水中爆炸後立即發生之輻射能，「估計等於數百噸原子能」。兩個估計集團之參觀艦「海文號」所泊之處，離爆炸地點十一哩，報告中述及炸彈所造成之</p>
<p>主要損害如下：主力艦「亞甘薩斯」號立即下沉，航艦「沙拉吐加」號在炸彈爆炸後七小時半內沉沒，驅逐艦「休斯」號擱在沙難上，得免沉沒，日主力艦「長門」號在爆炸後五天沉沒。總統之估計委會報告中，以空中爆炸與水中爆炸互相比較，獲得如下結論：「根據吾人所作　察，泊於損書區內之水上　船，其所受空中爆炸之損害，似較水中爆炸更爲嚴重，第二顆炸彈所引起之洪水，內含致命之輻射線。一個敵人如有二枚或二枚以上之原子彈，能造成前後二次試騐合併之損害。二次試騐之結果，已在船舶局研究中，預料將來船艦之大小式樣與構造，將完全改觀，此種改變能减少爆炸之影響，吾人相信距離爲</p>
<p>最佳防禦比基尼試騐明確顯示未來之原干彈戰爭，將毀滅國家，並改變目前文明水準。世界如欲安全，即不應以戰爭爲解決國際爭端之工具，此誠爲顯而易見之事」。聯合參謀部估計委會之報告，詳述原子彈爆炸經過，略稱：「原子彈激起之水柱，直徑廣達二千二百呎，高至五千五百呎。水柱約含海水一千萬噸，水柱以外之波浪（約距落彈處一千呎）高達八十至一百呎。波浪向外湧去時，浪頭迅即逾益低落。測量海低波浪震動之工作仍未完成。原子彈爆炸時，亦無地震之現象」。論及爆發所產生之强烈。</p>
<p>輻射作用，則稱：「人頭與此種强烈輻射綫作用接觸數分鐘後，即將於瞬息間麻痹，並將於數日或數週內致死。此種傷書性極大之輻射綫海水，使視察隊於四日後進八目標區時仍難確保安全。損失詳情仍有待工程隊縝密關查後始能確知。兩次試騐中，目標艦排列不能代表正常之艦隊柱泊方式，目標艦之排列純爲獲得原子彈爆炸時所引起之最大結果而作。」委會報告之觀察及結論部分略種：「以通常爆炸之範疇估計原子彈爆炸，誠爲可能之事。第一顆原子彈於空中爆炸，半哩內之主要艦艇面設備均受慘重損失，憔其內部則僅有微小之損傷。在</p>
<p>兩次試驗中，一哩內之艦艇幾無一艘未受損害。第二顆原子彈拋擲大量輻射綫海水，進入襤身及甲板，各艦常則成為輻射綫倉庫，輻射綫可灼死艦上任何生物。一一分析比基尼試騐之經過及其問題似嫌過早，吾人自應指出對於某些因原子彈而起之獨特問題，吾人應積極並即速加以研究。原子彈毒化大量海水即爲問題之一。吾人非但應研究保護艦上之海員問題，且應研究保護人民免受輻射綫損害之問題。」佔計委會之報告包括第一次試騐之補充報告一件，略謂「落彈區半哩內約有艦艇二十艘，各艦均受慘重損失，未沉沒各艦應予歷時十二日之初步修理，否則各艦均未能自行駛返主要基地，以待全部修理。」云</p>

<h3>在杜魯門總統家鄉歡度美國慶節日（下）　聽老華僑談古說今</h3>
<p>— （本報駐美特派員毛樹清）</p>
<p>國慶日，格林威纖上的「市長」孟根先生，仍在努力工作。孟根是一位汽車修理工人，也是莊園主人，也是商店老間，也是銀行經理，他是全村裏邊最富的人，所以被選爲市長，做總統故鄉的「父母官」。孟根是一位極勤勞和氣的人，他穿蕭工裝，在汽車修理廠見我們，伸着滿手油膩的雙手，很誠懇地歡迎我們去參觀當今元首的故園。格林威特猶太人很多，以前德國移來的美國人也很多。</p>
<p>村魯門父親是德移民，母親是英國移民。這些不同種族的人，在村子裏相處了幾十年，日子久了，彼此都和和煦煦，像自家人一樣。杜魯門當了美國大總統以後，村裏若干商人，想建造一些總統紀念勝蹟，以吸引全美各處的遊客，但都被杜魯門阻止了。據村中人說：杜魯門本人、非常痛恨這些無調的恭維與舖張，他不願意別人把他當作賺錢的「把戲」。我尋視全村，祇有一家轉灣角上的汽車修理站，新蓋的一幢陌屋上，寫着「杜魯門路口」。老華僑何麗園，在這一帶非常有「人緣」，他在村子中間走，左右招呼個不停。他那樣謙和淳厚，是美國人心目中典型的中國老百姓，他見人必問「嫂夫人平安？」「小寳寶健好？」道一類話，美國友人從心底裏對他發生好感。我看見那位小鎭上的孟根市長，用油膩的手，拉着他說了大半天不放。何麗園從前也住在這村內，廿五年前他和常今的元首，有過「日出而作，日人而息，雞犬之聲相聞。」的生活。他們在同一個村子，鄰居過六年。</p>
<p>何老對我說戰前，五塊錢可以屋一個傭工，耕作一星期。戰後人力大貴了，六塊錢祗能雇傭工操作一天，而一天的工作時間又不及八小時。每星期付七天的工錢，祗工作五天，其中有兩天休息，但必須照付工資。何老認爲這是非常不經濟的事，因此，他在前年決定把田地出賣，得地價一萬五千元。何老現在的生活是值得稱道的。五年以前，他的老伴侶逝世了，他兒子在印第安邶州，他一個人住在肯薩斯城林伍德街東段一二九號。他行中醫，賣中藥，許多外國人，出入於他的診所。他說勞碌了三十多年，對職業感到　倦了。但仍有許多美國人，常來求診。他有一輛自己駕駛的漂亮汽車，有三根獵槍，和兩根釣魚竿子。他過着業餘的極有風味的「漁獵生活」，常常獨個兒垂釣一天，晚上提着三條桂魚回家，自烹自食。萬葳斯城郊打獵是有限制的，每年十一月十二月間，祇開放四十五天狩獵。但釣魚是自由的，祇要領到了「釣魚證」，隨處都可垂釣。</p>
<p>肯薩斯城郊外，有大大小小七十五個湖，市政府特地爲許多釣客，養育魚種，餵給魚食，歡迎市民閒來無事去垂釣消遺。他每天早睡早起，很關心祖國，他有美國國籍，但他白動放棄。他說：「我是中國人，一輩子不會改變的。」他厭惡華僑青年們的不良娛樂，常常鼓勵靑年人上進。他不歡喜煩贊的都市，他的汽車，多半行駛在郊外，沈作乾領事和我離開肯薩斯前的某夜，他用汽車把我們裝到僻靜郊外一家叫做「珊黛」的館子裏晚餐。夏夜的凉風，飄拂在肯薩斯郊外，　拂着何老的瀟瀟白髮，夜色濛朧中，我望着他那壯健的黑影，深深地爲他祝福！（七月十日肯薩斯城航訊）—完—</p>

<h3>警備部招待記者報告　榮案破獲經過　審訊主犯駱文慶採用精神磨折法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕榮德生綁案全部偵查及破獲經過，已由驚備司令部稽查處長陶一珊氏親繕報告書，動員該處內勤人員竟三畫夜全力彙編完成，呈經宣司令核閱後，昨日下午五時招待新聞界公開發表。陶氏携厚達寸餘之偵查報告書含笑步入記者麕集之會客室，首對本案破獲經過作一般性之解釋，略謂本案能迅速破獲，實由於爭取主動及軍警機關密切合作之結果。在進行期間，盡量遵守大公無私及謹愼機密之原則，而對於捕獲之人犯則絕對不用刑訊。陶氏舉例稱：慣匪駱文慶先後訊問十五次，均無真實之口供，最後採用「精神磨折」法，派十五人輸流連續盤詰四十八小時，卒使駱犯不堪其煩，而招供一切云。又此次綁榮之所以能成為事實，亦可謂由駱而起，按駱以前曾犯案二十次以上，人稱之為「爺叔」，本案各從犯起初多有戒備之心，旋被袁仲杼慫恿稱：「跟駱爺叔幹，決不會失風」。各犯遂放胆勾結下手。現全案要犯十五名已移解軍法處開始審判，尚有袁爭飛鐘伯元熊永和泮金龍四名亦暫解軍法處，惟悉與本案並無多大關係云。茲將本案詳情分誌於後：</p>
<p>綁架經過</p>
<p>五月廿五日上午八時許，由駱文慶·張少卿·黄阿虎等四人，在華成路民國路口搭乘吳志剛借來之一五〇四四號汽車（吳之汽車係向本部副官處長王公遐借來），由吳之司機朱連生開赴高恩路麥尼尼路口停車，駱等四人下軍等候，榮氏汽車開出，由張少鄉上前攔停，嚇禁聲張，並由黄阿虎出示僞造之紅色逮捕證，僞稱某機關請去一談，由駱文慶上車將榮氏挾下，強行架入一五〇四四號汽車，經貝常路輾轉經過梵皇渡車站，中山路，至閘北水電路水電公司附近十字路口停車，黃阿在彼迎候，與駱等挾肉票下軍，由駱文慶張少卿黄阿寳三人帶榮至小浜邊，挾上備妥之民船上，駱與張少卿亦即坐黄包軍回來，肉票由黄阿寳負責，汽車則由宋連生開回，劉黄兩人分由小路乘坐人力車回上海。</p>
<p>藏票地點</p>
<p>肉票榮氏，由駱文慶·張少卿·黃阿寶等挾持帶至一小浜邊預先雇備之民船中藏匿，船主奚阿川，看票人爲　阿毛，（恐係駱文慶捏造，此名現正嚴緝中）羅渭泉黄阿寳及黄之姘婦張吳月　，次日下午六七點鐘，由駱文慶坐吳志剛之汽車，仍由朱連生駕駛，至極司非爾路梅邨下車，等到八九點鐘，又開至中山路水電公司，將一個穿藍布衣服的與一個胖老頭子（即榮）上車，至曹家渡過橋停下，由駱等將肉票改坐黄包車移藏於曹家渡五角塲老公益里一百號黄阿寳家中，袁則原車至大世界。</p>
<p>接洽情形</p>
<p>一·電話：由駱文慶邀同鄭蓮棠先以電話與申新九廠經理吳昆生接治，索價贖票。後吳發覺電話被監視，警告其停止接治，乃由鄭等於電話簿中覓得申新九廠副經理陳品三之電話號碼，由　致電與陳，繼續論價，前後由鄭打出電話十餘次。二·信函：匪方曾勒迫肉票繕親筆信兩對，交其家屬，遞交方法，則由駱文慶將該函匿置在祥生飯店下廣厠所內洗面盆下，然後致電話與陳品三，囑其取去，五月十五日匪方以事主方面未能迅速解決，乃具一不具姓名之恐嚇信，由郵局寄交詹榮培，極恐嚇之能事。三·招貼：匪方以電話連給發生困難，不便多作談話，乃利用紅紙召租招貼，於五月廿三貼於靜安寺西邊成順當牆壁上，招貼背面另藏小紙，註明交款路途，廿四日則貼在南京大戲院壁上，背後小紙註明在神州旅社三一六號房間接洽。</p>
<p>贖票前後</p>
<p>匪方贖票索價初為美金一百萬元，最後減至美金五十萬元，交款經手人則由袁仲抒邀同吳志剛與申新二·五廠經理詹榮培接洽，吳爲復旦大學畢業生。現任華大企業公司經理，與詹素友善。詹則向有身價，且為榮氏至好，向具信譽，因此乃由吳代表匪方，詹代表榮氏，商洽交割贖款手續，經數度商洽後，於五月廿七日上午九時，在勞工醫院八號房間，由吳將肉票榮德生身藏之金五十萬元，裝一皮箱，鎖好後，道經福煦路康樂邨五十四號吳之岳母家中，吳收下該箱後，即私自開啟取出美金十萬元，用布包好，以美金四十萬仍存箱內，重行鎖好，將原箱乘汽車送交南陽橋袁仲抒處，袁即携箱至民國路五四八號陳駱氏（駱文慶之妹）家中，是時駱文慶·黃阿寶均在相候，是項贖款交割後，即於當日下午十時左右，由駱文慶·張少卿仍用吳志剛之汽車及其司機朱連生，將肉票送至福開森路體飛路口下車，由駱文慶代雇三輪車送回麥尼尼路榮婿唐能源家，於是被綁月餘之肉票榮德生，因出五十萬美金之代價，乃告出綁。</p>
<p>分贓辦法</p>
<p>（一）規定分配額，於駱文慶身上搜出日記薄一本，內　銀美金四十萬之分配辦法如下，（餘美金十萬元為吳志剛私吞）A綁案資本法幣五百萬元，B綁前許願法幣一千萬元，C其餘分爲十六股半，每股美金二萬二千元，（a）袁仲抒發起一股，指揮一股，共得二股，（b）吳志剛借車得一股，（c）趙紹宗通訊得半股，（a）黃紹寶得一股半，（e）奚阿川看標一股，租船一股，共得二股，（f）鄭蓮棠接電話得一股，接洽一股，共得二股，（g）張少卿帮手得一股，（h）劉瑞標帮手得一股，（i）黄阿寳得一股半，（j）駱文慶發起一股，資本一股，綁手一股，共得三股。D實得分配額，根據各案犯口供，計算各犯實得分配贓銀數如下：（a）駱文慶美金七萬六千元，（b）袁仲抒美金二萬七千元，（c）朱產生美金五千元，（d）吳志剛美金十三萬元，（e）朱連生美金七千元，（f）鄭蓮棠美金四萬元，（g）黄紹寅美金一萬五千元，（h）趙紹宗美金一萬元，查以上各犯實得數僅美金卅一萬元，與實數相應殊鉅，其差額大多爲該案主要各犯如駱文慶袁仲抒與黃阿寶所吞沒。</p>

<h3>美國第一所盲童學校（續昨）　一八二九年創立的配肯斯</h3>
<p>幼稚園裏，有一切的辦戲設備，滑梯，鞦韆，球，他們都可以自由地玩。如果跌倒，就自已爬起，彈一彈身上的灰塵，仍舊玩。因爲跌交是很平常的事情，也沒有孩子會哭了。</p>
<p>孩子們都和敎員住在一塊，可以得到更多的接觸。課程是和普通的學校差不多的，他們靠了手指來摸突起的文字。勃萊里城有一張專爲肓人用的週報出版，靠了這報，他們也知道了世界上的一切新聞。他們也有職業的課程，如製蓆，木工，紡織，機械等等。他們也可以進普通的大學，配肯斯的畢業生現在有很多在哈佛，波斯頓大學，和別的大學讀書。</p>
<p>在音樂上，他們尤其有很高的造就。每個配肯斯的學生都必須會彈鋼琴。全校二百五十七個學生，從五歲到十九歲都有，共有七十一架鋼琴，還有其他一切的樂器。</p>
<p>不但是盲童，盲而又豐的學生也在那裏讀書。他們靠了字義，和不同的震動來學習。起先，有電流設備來帮助，以後，只要把手指按在對方的臉上，他們就可以知道一切的意義。拼音式的文字學習方法，是完全被拋棄了。</p>
<p>配肯斯盲童學校的學生們，來自美國和其他的十九個國家，包括中國在內。許多畢業生回去後也已辦了同樣性質的學校，中國現在也已有了一所。（譯自美國新聞處稿：完）</p>

<h3>拆息太重開銷太大　絲綢廠號同感困難　無法出口為當前致命傷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在高利貸聲中，繅絲廠榮獨以月息一分八厘之條件，承中央銀行借款二百萬萬元，爲收　之熱本，且又以同等條件，給與繅工貸款一百萬萬元，不可謂非異數，但據調查，三省二市絲廠約百餘家，已開工者，尚不及五分之一，本市戰前絲廠林立，目下僅剩大利，連元，大明，合豐等四五家，勉强開工，情形仍極慘淡，據業中人計算，政府雖有平利貸款，而收　之價，却限定爲每担十二萬元，因之繅絲一担，須　本二百四十萬元，再加工資，廠繳，利息等，亦在一百萬元以上，則絲之成本，每担爲三百數十萬元。</p>
<p>成本與售價相去仍太遠</p>
<p>現在紐約行市，每磅美金九百三十三磅合一担而主，每担可得美金一千二百元，合法幣二百四十萬元，而自廠裝運至美國之水脚，上下力·及保險費等，尚未計算在內，如此，則每出絲一担，須虧本百分之五十以上，同業自不敢放手做去，據繅絲工業公會方面消息，同業所存春　，可供繅絲二萬担之用，但以成本難合，出口不易，須請求政府給與出口津貼，方可開繅云，又進出口業權威者談，絲爲我國出口貨之重心，戰前每年可出口十二萬担左右，今年雖經種種努力，僅得八九千祖担，並稱國外對於華絲之信用，依然良好。</p>
<p>連鎖制實行於外匯有利</p>
<p>目下各方主張進出口連鎖制，如能實現，則十二萬担絲之出口匯票，可得一萬數千萬元美金之外滙頭寸，政府自應統盤籌算，予以支撑云，在繅絲工業沒落期中，織綢廠與絲號，同受困難，據綢廠公會透露消息，本市現膚織機五千數百台，但以絲織品銷路不振，數月來勞資磨擦，創傷未復，迄今開工者寥寥，又據綢緞阪賣業方面消息，銷路淸淡，壓本太熏，在高利盤剝之下，同業將無生路，日來擱淺停業者已有多家，但敗症早伏，一時難以挽救，據稱戰前存綢一疋，元本四十元，以墊本月息一分計，聽息四角</p>
<p>貼息太高了　綢業無生路</p>
<p>今則每疋壓本三十本短絀者非借款不可，市息按月一角五分，應解息四萬五千元，是貨價之漲爲八千倍弱，而利息則漲至十萬倍云，絲號業方面，據公會消息，現有會員一百三四十家，包括絲綿販賣業在內，規模較大者約三四十家，尚有數十家係掮客性質，資本甚小，生意又淸，不堪負担各種捐稅。</p>
<p>絲號太痛苦　求援於商會</p>
<p>已請示商會，予以援助，據有關係方面談稱，絲號之主要業務，向來爲代小型繅絲廠　款，並爲之經售出口，目下出口不振，綢廠失敗，該業之困難，自可想見，至於該業向市商會請求援助一節，據商會方面透露消息，各業之因不得已而淪爲掮客者甚多，捐稅方面極應加以體恤云。</p>
<p>債市平穩</p>
<p>公債昨僅甲種有業外游資代某洋行吸收而見穩，統丙有八套賣，回挫少許，丁戊平穩，晨初甲乙在四二〇元，丙種自七四〇元見挫至七〇〇元關，戊種開後稍瘦，近午僅甲乙回升至四五〇元以上結束，結果與前收相較，計甲乙各升二十元，丙跌二十元，丁戊均平。</p>
<h3>美棉將漲</h3>
<p>美棉業界之觀察</p>
<p>〔路透社紐奧林三日電〕據多教人談論，棉價每磅即將增至美金四角至五角，因管制已取消，每磅三角五分之官價已失效也，農業局長麥克納特亦稱在以後數月內，可能飛漲至每磅五角，而喬治亞州農業局長林特則謂，每磅五角，仍可謂相當價廉。</p>
<h3>金鈔變動甚微</h3>
<p>烚赤平穩乏變，起仆有限，交易不多，晨開時在一八八萬五光景徘徊，報載黄金流入中國之訊，開後自一八八萬八略有供給，中央配出五五條，價一八八萬五，十時後略有下游，降至一八七萬八，而後見定，午刻站一八八萬以上，午後形勢更穩、在一八八萬五光景，結果較前收徽升三千，飾金紋銀銀元俱平，暗拆自一角至一角二分之間。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔更爲平庸，晟開二五〇〇元，開後求供零散，缺乏特變，起仆殊窄，金市下游，自二五一〇元降至二四九〇元左右而後稍穩，午刻又在二四九五元光景掙扎，午後因適逢週六，而告平穩，結果較前收微挫五元，港票亦屬平庸，市上籌碼不多，結果穩平。</p>
<h3>未正式弛禁前　紗布破例出口說　數量颇钜已獲当局特許</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕接近紡建公司之紗布業方面傳出消息，該公司最近將有相當巨額之棉織品，已得行政院宋院長之特許，運銷南洋，並稱政府自本年三月一日頒佈進出口貿易暫行辦法，列棉紗布爲禁止出口品，本附有經政府核准，仍得飭海關騐放之但未規定，故此次出口，可於短時期內見諸事貴，據紡建負責人表示，仍當申請政府正式弛禁，以爭取國外市塲云，民營棉製品業權威方面意見，目下匯價不合，紗廠又蒙受高利，複製工業，已不能與洋貨相競爭，必須政府放棄其高紗價政策，方可令民營工業追隨政府之後，爭取國外市塲，按紗布是否開禁，傳說不一，此訊得諸可靠方面，故並載之。</p>
<h3>客幫略有問津　紗價止跌轉穩</h3>
<p>昨日紗市已露曙光，廣帮對大型紗如雙馬余鷄略有叩詢，中小型亦有京于無來客選購，交易尚不寂寞，二十支紗因是止跌種穩，然細紗去化寥寥、仍鮮起色，人心尚稱平定，靜待秋銷開展，</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊均漲廿至廿九磅音，計近期美金三三·九五，新花遠期三一·〇九，米特林現貨三四·七八，本埠現棉交易較爲减色，因週六關係，舫建與民營紗廠均存觀望，是以交易稀少。</p>
<p>嗶嘰龍頭因疲乏多日，一部份稍有拉提之舉動，但實際交易依然寥寥，所以其他布價仍無生氣，午時紡建開售之盤與上期相仿，嗶嘰仍爲五萬二千元，龍頭價五萬五千元，但購買者日鮮。</p>
<h3>大戶交易星稀　華股全面疲跌</h3>
<p>華股平庸而疲，永紗籌碼告鬆，欲漲乏力，終告下游，美亞過程尚穩，起仆有限，三小熱由高而低，續見不振，各股進退殊不一律，中途互有出人，冷門各股交易更爲淸閑，無人鼓動，市氣銷沉，稍有低落，各大戶出入零散，顯告休息，最初高價永紗見七一三元，美亞三八八〇元，景福二四五元，新光二四五元，勤與一七八元，近午低價永紗六八〇元，美亞三七〇〇元，景福二三二元，新光二二五元，勤與一六五元，結果較前收計永紗成跌十九元，美亞跌一〇〇元，景福·新光·勤典三小熱各再微降，較冷各中小型亦有帶小，元老股亦稍疲軟。</p>
<p>外股在低價盤旋，欲升仍無鼓勵，怡紗中途會微升，但難越前收價以上，終有散多脫手，仍現微怯，怡啤跌落過多，略見穩健，祥泰木行四千元，墾植二五〇〇元，均有成交，結果與前收相較，計怡啤徽升，怡紗·英聯·會德豐·亞洲·紙業各告小挫，業廣鋼業下降半成。</p>
<h3>青島菸葉分批運滬　平均配售各捲煙廠家</h3>
<p>邇來滬上各貨市塲，外貨充斥，以致民族工業，大受打擊，即以捲烟一項言之，美國香烟，挾其裝璜美觀，成本低廉之優勢　來，暢銷市上，而國產廠家，以工資高易，原料缺乏之故，不堪匹敵，茲間蘇浙皖敵偽產業處理局，已將青島方面接收之敵產煙葉積極分批運滬，委讬經濟部接管中華烟草公司陸續分售興上海各捲烟製造廠，其辦理原則係分售與各已在貨物稅局登記之廠商爲限，分售辦法係先行通知捲烟業同業公會轉知本市各捲烟廠家，依其確實需要程度，塡眞申請書，申請購買，然後按此申請數額與可能運滬烟葉總量之百分比，平均分配，每次配售時，一方招待各廠家看樣，一方依照處理局評定傻格，通知各廠家至指定銀行繳款，再憑繳款單存根向中華烟草公司換取棧單出貨，自開始以來，業已分售三次，共售出約一萬桶，而陸續運滬者尚有一萬餘桶，現正繼續積極辦理中，將予逐次分批配售，務使各申請廠家取得充分原料，但一經中途自行放棄者，即取銷其續購資格</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨據銀錢業聯合準備會籌備處某負責人語記者稱：該處此次計出發通函一百七十二件，邀請各行莊及信託公司等參加該會。目前覆信加入者，共達一百五十二家。中國，交通，中國農民三行，及中信，郵匯兩局，雖以國家行局關係，地位不免超然，故該會未去函邀請。惟依過去銀行聯合準備會之習慣而言，各行局參加之可能性頗大。現召開成立大會之期，雖尚未確定，惟當能望早日成立。又據談：該會成立之後，辦理同業拆放，亦不過於眞正必要時，酌爲臨時之調劑，而絕非可以對一般同業，常川供應營運資金。深望各同業，對自身業務之經營，應力求穩健云。</p>

<p>四强之一的中華民國大國民，在勝利後的今天爲了幾位勇於私鬥的「紅色英雄」們野心不死，弄得當政的焦頭爛額，將士們肝臘地，老百姓不知死所，外國人搖頭歎氣。想起來，眞是不勝倒霉之至。在這個年頭兒、生活的鞭子，苦惱的日子，委實已經將我們四萬萬五千萬大國民攪得「不知明日」，「　論寒暑」了，所以直到今天，眞正是到　山來消夏避暑的人，統計還不到二百人。根據廬山管理局長吳仕漢的報告，全山的人口現在已達一萬四千餘，較之去年九月份調查在山人口二千餘人，增加了五倍，可是就最近增加的人口分類統計，約爲（一）回家的本地居民四千餘人，（二）公務員三千人，（包括夏令營辦公人員受訓學員）（三）應時商販一千人，（四）軍憲警約一千人（五）苦力三千人，（六）新聞工作者一百人，（包括中央力行兩報廬山版員工及京滬漢省潯各報駐牯記者。）（七）公敎人員眷屬及外來避暑者，約爲二百人。從上列統計數字觀察，可見今年廬山避暑人數之少，較之抗戰前數年每年入夏在山人數，平均每月約爲三萬人，入山人數平均每月的爲一萬人，相差甚大。當此各地苦熱，廬山獨凉的時候，有錢有閒的人們不來廬山消夏，足見時至今日，有錢的人們心弦之緊張，芸芸衆生都變成了熱鍋上的螞蟻，這現象是值得注意的了。</p>
<p>然而，正爲避暑人少出汗人多，今年的廬山就更加顯得淸凈，秀麗，挺拔，雄奇，記得九年前廬山掌故的人們，似乎都預感到今年的廬山也許又將爲我們的國家鑄造一頁新的歷史，於是大批記者羣也就跟着我們的元首以及馬歇爾特使司徒大使，紛紛來到廬山。</p>
<p>一瓣心香祈平安</p>
<p>新聞紙的讀者，旅行雜誌的主　，有山水　的旅行家，對於匡廬的風景和氣概，都可背得出，毋須我們賣弄風雅，假裝淵博來糟蹋紙張我們如果不是盲目，應該代表那些可憐的老百姓向山靈陳訴一番心底深處的痛苦。現在，全中國的良善人民，以及全世界同情中國的人們，視綫都已集中到這氣節之邦的江西廬山，尤其是那數在千萬以上逃勝利難的難胞們，他們是無家可歸，無衣無食，身無一物，可以孝敬「紅色英雄」們，惟有以剩餘的虔誠掬出一瓣心香，獻給我們的元首蔣主席和可敬可愛的馬帥與司徒大使。他們一致祈禱上蒼，希望在這一個端嚴淸凈的中國夏都，能發出一點好消息，即使給他們一個字一個「和」字，或者是「戰」字，他們都會笑出眼淚來·但是不要「拖」萬萬「拖」不得，因爲再將這尷尬的局勢拖下去，大家都會拖到死。他們現在做夢都在期待，他們期待終有一天，會從那牯嶺高處發出一個決定性的消息來，不管「戰」與「和」，不問「好」與「壞」，只求國家得平安。</p>
<p>元戎自有定國計</p>
<p>這些戰勝國難胞們的一可憐相，我們的元首蔣主席，馬特使，司徒大使，早就在各色各樣的中外報紙上看得淸淸楚楚，而不禁惻然心傷，不過造成千萬難胞的這一個中國共產黨問題，尚不僅是千萬人的生命財產有無保障問題，而是中國整個國家民族安危存亡問題，也可說是整個世界能否從此獲致永久和平的一個重大問題，而且這個問題，又相當複雜，處理這樣重大的問題，與部署戰爭，向一個勝利的目標邁進，有極大之區別。何况這個問題的裏面，除去「軍事」，「政治」，「經濟」，「交通」，以外，還有「其他」，因此爲了爭取更優裕的思考時間，爲了使用若干冷靜而縝密的頭腦，來研討這一個複雜突兀而又善變的中國共產黨問題，同時爲了期望在應付這反常的問題的期間，不致影響平常的軍政大計，決斷，與策動因此，全中國有良知的人們，一致公認我們的元首蔣主席這次登廬以後，不啻象徴了國家前途的光明。因爲大家知道在抗戰期間主席爲了領導全國人民向一個抗戰必勝的總目標邁進，他可以在軍　傍午的緊急時間，每天主持三次最高參謀會議，甚至每次開會時間，曾長達三小時，然而純軍事問題，究與一個複雜的政治間題有甚大之差異，處理這個問題，還需要一種絕對健旺的工作精神，與夫一個較長的工作時間，毋怪新聞記者看到主席健康的容色，大家都說有辦法。</p>
<p>佇看降書獻名山</p>
<p>現在、截到今天爲止，蔣主席在廬山已經度過了兩個週末，馬帥和司徒大使已於前昨兩日重臨牯嶺，和平談判之門，能否於最短期間打開，決定於本週，難然消息是沒有透露一點兒，但是爲了馬帥和司徒的健康，似乎也不能再拖下去吧。在廬山的人們都說：馬帥已瘦·司徒病（大使今日閙胃寒，長使吾民淚滿襟）唉，兩位老人家也給這個苦惱的問題拖够了。何况在舉國怒呼，中共必須退出蘇北膠東熱察各地」「交通必須恢復」的今天，的確又像到了一個最後關頭。</p>
<p>歷史如須重演，這座廬山就是新中國的發祥地，說短些，在這一座名山決定救國救民的大計，第一次決定了戡亂大計，第二次決定了抗戰大計，第三次決定了封鎖馬當口的制寇大計，現在如果再決定一次，就是第四次，我們希望的是建國大計，我們賢明的元首夙夜匪懈，在計劃的聽說均是建國大計，不是戡亂大計，不過還待中共作最後抉擇。如果歷史確需重演，那麽羅家倫先生所寫的廬山歌中最後的一句，「廬山預築受降台，」我們將認爲是一句有利於中共政治生命的佳　，請以蘇北戰局爲證。武力似乎不是一個帮助政黨的好法子，何必兒戯國運，塗炭生靈，鑽進一個牛角尖呢？上面這些帶有主觀的說法和看法，都是從一班老廬山口中傳出的人民之聲。記者因爲廬山的山民，對國事的認識，有其實貴的歷史經驗，所以也把他寫出來，同時也可說明，廬山現在沒有什麽消息，廬山尚在期待中，而此時此刻，在廬山牯領街上滿街飛的二十幾位新聞記者，正在浪費報館給予難得的金錢等重大的消息。</p>

<h3>論中國政局之出路</h3>
<p>— 蔣君章</p>
<p>（一）沉悶和矛盾</p>
<p>我們中國的政局，到了今天，可以說沉悶已達極點，牙盾也已達極點。誰都知道中國需要和平，需要統一，更需要建設，人民方面更需要休養生息。可是勝利以後差不多到一年的時間，和平現實現了沒有？統一成功了沒有？因爲這兩個基本條件沒有辦到，於是國家的建設和人民的休養，自然也就無從談起。這種空氣，眞正使人沉悶不堪；這種現象，眞正使人矛盾不解。</p>
<p>自從長春克復以後，和平商談又複開始，並且限定商談的期間爲十五天，這個消息曾給予我們以莫大的希望和安慰，等到十五天談判不好，又加上八天，八天又談判不好，繼之以無期的拖。在這個拖的時期內，反而使火藥氣味散滿於淮黃平原。於是有所謂爭取和平的組織和反內亂的組織，不管它們的招牌怎麼樣不同，而和平統一，是一個大潮流，乃是顯然的。儘管是十足的好戰份子，也只好躲在和平的大幌子後面，口裏喊着和平，手裏演出搗亂·因此，增加了當前的矛盾，却更使我們渴望和平的人陷入憂慮的境地。</p>
<p>這種巧妙的宣傳，對我們徒具熱心而缺乏辨別經騐的智識份子，尤其是靑年，是很容易中毒的。好比病菌的傳染疾病，徒具熱心的智識份子有如抵抗力薄弱的人一樣，很有無辜被害的危險。「防疫」是件重要工作。在這個沉悶和矛盾的政局中，指出有利於國家的途徑，以供我智識份子確定主張時的參考，免中宣傳之毒，以貽誤於國家，當然也是一個重要工作。筆者願以個人用客觀考察所得的幾個意見，擬述如下：</p>
<p>（二）看清可能的結局</p>
<p>就中國目前的政局，未來的演變，不外乎下列五種：</p>
<p>（一）維持近一年來的現狀，即所謂談談打打，打打談談的局面，或一面談一面打局面。那便是說問題永遠解決不了，僵局永遠打不開，而最後則國破家亡的末日來臨。</p>
<p>（二）努力創造理想的局面，這個局面便是和平統一的大原則，其具體的辦法便是軍隊國家化，政治民主化。那就是說：屬於政黨的或個人的軍隊和地盤，都交給國家，建立沒有黨派色彩的國防軍。同時，一切政黨地位平等，在不妨礙社會秩序和國家利益的前提下，都可自由參加政治活動。目前的急務，就是在和平統一的環境下，產生適合於國家的憲法，以便組織國民大會，產生正式政府。在憲法未產生前，由各黨派參加政府工作，以收集思廣益之效。</p>
<p>（三）承認中國共產黨現有的局面，或者政府和共產黨作若干交換，把中共和政府犬牙交錯的區域變成功整齊劃一，疆界淸晰的兩部份，那便是說，把中國分治，變成實行三民主義的中國與實行共產主義的中國，從此中國就正式分爲兩個國家。</p>
<p>（四）由共產黨的力量，用武力來打倒政府，以造成蘇維埃的中國。</p>
<p>（五）由政府的力量，用武力來擊敗或解決中共所有的武力，以統一國家。</p>
<p>此外還有兩個絕對不可能的結局，那就是由國民黨把現有的政權交給共產黨，或由共產黨把現有的地方政權無條件的交給國民政府。這兩個方法本來是最簡單而有效的，但實際上幾乎是絕不可能。因爲一個政黨成立的動機，便是爲了要掌握政權。國民黨是國內第一大黨，它奮鬥六十年，推翻了滿淸，打倒了軍閥，這回子又領導了全國苦戰八年打倒了日本帝國主義。國民政府是一個國際所承認的政府，大部份的國土都在國民政府直接治理之下，它對國家有撥亂反正，繼絕興亡的責任。我們希望這樣一個政黨交出他苦鬥所得的政權，放棄它爲國盡責的責任，是怎樣可能呢？同樣的道理，共產黨自從湘　暴動到「二萬五千里長征」，也有了幾二十年的歷史，從前它沒有一兵一卒的武力，沒有一邑一鄕的地盤，它尚且還要暴動，還想奪取政權，現在據說已有三百多縣的地盤，有近百萬的軍隊，還有號稱百萬以上的保安隊或民兵，它會得把這些汗血浩成的東西，拱手讓人嗎？這也是一個不可思議的奇蹟。</p>
<p>上述這五種可能的結局，我們又可歸納成爲「分合治亂」四個大字。第一個可能的結局和第三個可能的結局，是「分」的現象，是亂的趨勢。第四和第五兩個結局，是先要經過一個戰亂的階段，然後可以得到國家的統一。只有第二個結局綫可以不經戰亂就可以得到國家統一和人民休養的結果，故稱之爲理想的局面·這理想的局面之造成，本來是需要經過談判的，不過談判需要雙方有解決問題的誠意，如果一方面有誠意，而另方面却是只存着利用的心思，不過是看作爭取時間和空間的一種手段，那一定要弄到問題之中又有問題，枝節外再生枝節，永遠得不到結論，即使是有了結論，也不過是杆格難行的具文·這樣的談判，只能够產生第一結局，絕對產生不出第二結局來的；而最不幸的，過去的談判就是這樣的談判。</p>
<p>（三）找出癥結的所在</p>
<p>談判的不成，是因爲有一個方面沒有解決問題的誠意·那末那一方面缺乏誠意呢？很淸楚的，政府一定希望解決問題以安定社會，建設國家，藉以確保抗戰勝利的碩果，而把未來政權由那一個政黨來執掌的問題，交給憲法制定以後的全國人民去解決。但，中國共產黨是迷信武裝暴動以奪取政權的政黨。在最近的談判中，共黨軍隊統編不能實行，駐地無法解決，就是僵局不得打開的主要原因，而所以成爲僵局，當然是爲了要使用這些武力以奪取政權的原故。奪取政權最重要的方法，是不斷的擴大間題，製造紛亂和恐怖，使政府沒有能力可以控制大局，這便是最有利的時機。中國歷史告訴我們，一個朝代的滅亡，多半由於中央政府的失政，加上連年的水旱災荒，哀鴻遍野，餓莩載道，盜賊遍於四方，鄕間起而自衛，桀黠者承機起而利用，分崩雜亂的局面，由此造成，舊的王朝也許就此推翻。抗戰給與我們國家和人民的損失，如此重大，倫陷區域如此的廣，社會秩序道樣的不安定，道在中共看來，當然是推翻政府奪取政權的機會，那裏肯邦易放棄這機會的？中共爲了要使奪取政權更爲有利，便要設法製造問題，擴大問題，甚至恐怖還得要製造擴大，譬如它的反美宣傳，反美行動，都在過迫談判的調人知難而退，它那裏有絲亳肯和政府來解決問題的誠意呢？道是以往談判無效的　結所在。</p>
<p>由是可知中共的目的，是要武力來打倒它的政敵，取得統治全國的實權。但是中共爲什麼不乾脆使用武力政策呢？原因是很簡單，就是它此時的力量還嫌不够。我們假使用客觀的態度來注意閱讀勝利消息傳出了以後的熏慶新華日報，這裏我們可以得到兩個結論：</p>
<p>（一）在去年八月十一日至九月這一個期間，新華的言論和消息是儘量在受降權的爭論和「解放區」的擴大，今天光復了什麽城，明天解放了什麼市，不時有統計表出來，說明光復或解放了多少城市。在這個期間只有極不重要的地位可以發現某些地方頑强抵抗難於解放的消息。到了九月以後，解放的消息或統計逐漸少，反內戰的言論和消息，逐漸佔了地位。到了十月中旬以後，反內戰的言論和消息。佔了最重要的地位，同時帶出了和平的要求，而何思源孫連仲　鍚山等幾位北方負責的軍政長官，都是被駡得狗血淋頭。這意味着什麽？就是在中共的軍事擴展期中，　言內戰，而以起義圍攻數僞等名詞代表了戰事的發展；到中共軍事不能發展甚至遭遇失敗以後，便來宣傳反內戰與和平，和平厭戰，是我們全國同胞熬切的期望，軍事失敗以後的共黨，宜傳反內戰與和平，一方面是迎合了全國的人心，一方面是掩護了自己力量的不够，而同時可以保障了它已佔得的地盤，為將來再行進攻的根據地，所以中共說和平，是一種手段，是籍以保護解放區和實力的一種手段，是和他武裝暴動以奪取政權的中心策略相輔而行的。這個　結所在，我們必須要看明白，而後才知道所謂停止衝突，恢復交通的命令，軍隊整編統編方案，以及政治協商會議的決議等，都是在這種以和平爲手段的宣傳之下所產生的，中共在根本上並無實行的誠意。</p>
<p>（二）中共喊和平是有地域的區別的。在新華日報上所發現叫喊和平最努力的區域，是中原區（即湖北大洪山迤東至麻黃一帶的地區）和東江區（即廣東東江若干山地），有時還提到瓊崖區。實際上衝突最激烈或形勢最嚴重的區域是山東的泰安一帶，北與河南的昆連區如永年等地，晋東南區，熱河的赤峰平泉與東北，以及最近蘇北各地，但在新華日報上很少發現這些區域的戰事消息，有時候則可發現若干零星解釋性或辯駁性的通訊社稿或論文談話之類，無非是說被動的或自衛的甚或說是人家造謠言。有時候克復一個一個重要地方或得而復失的時候，也是有新聞的。關於前者的消息總是誇大地說出人民軍隊如何的有力量能作戰；關於後者的新聞，總是說人民軍隊爲了尊重和平或任務已經完成，所以退出去了。至於鐵路與電綫的破壞等消息，那是水遠不報道的。這些表示什麽？我的看法，這顯示中共在力量薄弱的區域是需要和平的，在力量雄厚的地方是需要戰爭的。</p>
<p>從這兩個結論上，我們可以知道中共所採的策略，是以和平為手段，而以戰爭及奪取政權為目的。由於這種中心策略，它是以軍事攻勢與政治攻勢配合進行的，故任何和平談判，不過是中共政治攻勢的表演，很難得產生結果，即產生了結果，也是難於實行的了。</p>
<p>因此我們如果希望和平談判有效，只有在一個原則之下，可以達到目的。那就是勉强承認中共的武力和地盤，讓正式或非正式的成爲「國內之國」，把疆界厘訂淸楚，各保現狀，這樣才可以得到和平的結果。這便是「分」的結局。這便是我上面所說可能結局的第三種。這便是違背「統一」原則的和平。這樣的和平可以維持多久？那就要看中共認爲實力已足的時期在什麼時候，這個時候一到，戰爭仍然決難避免，而戰爭規模一定比現在要大，激烈的程度也更要大。那時候，國際上的磨擦如果加深，這次戰爭中被殘破的國家，如果已經有相當的休養，那末中國黨派問題的背景也會更比現在更複維。那時候，如果國際磨擦减少或消除，西方問題如果大體解決，則中國黨派問題的衝突，也許眞會引起國際千涉。故「國際干涉」的論調，此時所以若隱若現的透露者，也許就是中共的未來希望吧·然而無論如何，這種結局和我們國家和民族的前途，是利是害，我們的智識份子，一定可以辨別得很淸楚的。</p>
<p>（四）慎擇我們的途徑</p>
<p>我們中國目前所需要的是和平與統一，可是因爲有了兩個力量在同一個時間向同一個空間發展，因此不能和平，也不能統一·好比一個天平一樣，儘管一面的份量大些，一面的份量差些，但是差一些的這一方面究竟有相當的份量，可以使重一些的一面也不能够急轉直垂，因此使這個天平成爲一頭高一頭低的現象，弄得不上不下。筆者已經說過，如果要使中國共產黨遂其以武力奪取政權的目的，那必須經過一個很長的時期，而他的發展力量和速度，一定要大於政府的發展力量和發展速度，而這個可能的結果，是要使我們黄帝子孫和中華民國甚至世界和平說不定都要同歸於盡的。但如果我們把天平的較重一些的那面加重一些，那便可以造成急轉直垂的形勢，比較起來自然省事得多·這便是說，加重政府的力量。統一的可能便可增加，爭取和平的時間便可縮短，人民所受的痛苦，也便可减少·這是簡單明瞭的趨勢，無可懷疑的。「天下烏乎定？定於一」·到今天，我們所以要和平統一連起來說，仍然是這個道理。</p>
<p>增加政府的力量，不一定會產生武力統一的結局的。我們試看中共部隊在民國二十六年時的接受改編以及中共承認信仰三民主義，再看去年經過綏包之役以後的中共和最近長春戰役和蘇北衝突以後的中共，又在那裏喊「無條件停戰」了，它的態度，至少表面上是想要改變的。因此，我們可以知道當中共力量覺得相差懸殊時，它是會相當改變態度的。惟其在認爲相差不很遠的時侯，它是格外要憑藉武力的。有一位中共要人對朋友說，「中共不是不肯訂城下之盟，但也是要到了非訂不可的時候才好訂呀」。這真是道出了中共的心事」。</p>
<p>因此，我們留心時局的智識份子，願意參加政治活動的智識份子，你們果眞需要中國有一個長時期的混亂，讓中共發展力量，而使國家民族和世界和平同歸於盡嗎？那末你們就不妨多多替中共說話，多多削弱政府的力量，增加中共的氣勢。不然，你們是眞的希望中國和平統一的嗎？那末，你們就得要增加政府的力量，减少中共的氣燄，中共也就不能不改變態度了。政治上的立塲，是要以國家和民族的利害爲取決的標準，不可以私人恩怨做考慮的對象，更不可以個人的榮辱黜陟做決定的因素，尤其不應空發牢騷，不必徒傷際遇。否則必致誤入歧途，遣誤國家民族的。</p>

<h3>「寄生草」演員</h3>
<p>— 管玉</p>
<p>最近藝術工作團演出的「寄生草」，是洪深先生很早就翻譯出的劇本。這劇是描寫一個動都不肯動的少奶奶型的人物。她非但寄生在社會上和家庭里，並且還寄生在她接近的每一個人身上。她這種「寄生草」型的病，終於給她的哥哥醫治好了，醫治這病的藥：就是愛情上的妬忌心。</p>
<p>這是一個喜劇，諷刺着這類的少奶奶！它能够使每一個太太，小姐，少奶奶看了之後想一想，想她自己有沒有這種寄生病，假使有的話，就可以自己趕快改掉。</p>
<p>演這少奶奶的是丁芝，丁芝在勝利以來，還是第一次在舞台上表現她的演技。雖然我們沒有看到她什麼特緻的演技，但我們已經可以看出她是抓住這個性格了。全劇最明顯的一點，就是她每次上樓時的懶樣：嘴里在哼着，身體在無力地扭着，　子像無力支持着頭腦樣地使頭部東倒西斜，兩手扶着樓梯的扶手，慢慢地，一步步地走上樓去。這可以完全表現出她所表演的這個性格。</p>
<p>在她第一次剛從樓梯上下來，並沒有立即往台中的單人沙發上一坐，她只是站在沙發旁邊指使着別人拿一本雜誌，別人拿給她時，她同時也走上幾步去接，然後才坐下。這，假使坐在沙發中再指使別人去拿東西，不知是否更可以表現她的「寄生草」的性格。這雖然是一個小點，然而第一次的介紹性格，是必須特別鄭重的。</p>
<p>鲍庚文在上海舞台上還是第一次和觀衆見面。他的演技在這里顯明地是突出了一點，雖然他是一個樂觀的性格，又是從遠地回家來看他的妹妹，可以把心里的愉快情形表現在外面的行動上，但是，因爲其他演員的演技不够誇大，所以使他在這里成了一個「喜劇人物」。我們雖然並不覺得討厭，但感覺得他是過火了。在他全劇中最能使人感到滿意的一塲，就是第二幕前半幕剪花，插花的一塲：舞台上一句話都沒有，只看他插花·假使他眞正地把剪花和插花的事做完，而把花瓶放在桌上，那麽，他的演技我們又會覺得過火。好在他剪插完了，突然把瓶里的花扔在桌上，並咀咒着，這時，我們就可以知道他是故意在逗他這位寄生草的妹妹了。</p>
<p>在全劇的演出上，尚不算壞，藝術上還沒有大缺點，比那些在舞台上各顯各的神通自由發展的演出，要强得多了。</p>
<h3>演技中的形式派（續）</h3>
<p>— 葉子</p>
<p>梅氏第一時期是運動，第二時期恰巧相反，是靜止。親在，他是從事於姿式的程式，以代替動作的程式，他的偉大演出「欽差大臣」，可以作爲這一時期的頂點，便是企圖以連槃的姿式，互相交錯，而整個的結構還是靜止的，常運動作時，是由機械動力來指揮的。</p>
<p>物體的運動，是以其結合的力量，引發情緒的反應，藉其感覺的效果，刺激心理的反應，一枝雪茄或一把扇子，在演員手上，不再是單純的雪茄或扇子，而是象徵這些物體與其運用者間之關係的一切價值。</p>
<p>梅氏的角色，也都是象徵物，雖然現在穿着寫實的時裝，但却在瑣碎物件上，有些許的强調，有一定的誇張。</p>
<p>莫斯科，每人可以了解他自己的情緒，可以是需要導演的指導。但以外形爲主體的戲劇塲，是依賴演員在舞台的團體的地位，演員無從有到整個形式，有賴於坐在觀衆席間的導演來告訴他，在什麼時候，如何來配台那舞台構圖。</p>
<p>構成法—構成的裝懂替代裝飾，許多奇性的東西和人物都織進幻想的形態裏。</p>
<p>他自己說過他之運用演員，正有如彫塑家之運用黏土，用演員來創造不同的作品，獲得不同的效果，因此，最有黏性的演員，便成爲他的最好的演員。</p>
<p>他所有的演員，好像是許多橡皮球，他擲出去，球就得會跳，否則他拿了就無用。但是皮球要自己跳是不可能的，一個好皮球是不聲不響，無權自動，梅氏劇院也不容他個人的智能，梅自已供給所有的智能，正如他供給所有的技能一樣，但是有許多演員，都是優秀的，却不願作皮球，不論多麽好，也被人拋擲，所以，梅當然不易保有好的演員陣綫。</p>
<p>梅氏並不像史，找尋適合於演員的　法，而是找尋一種讀法，能與他自己的讀法最相近。他自己早已知道每個字的準確速度與首階，而演員只需用時間便可以準確的學到。</p>
<p>每一段動作，每一個貶眨眼，每一段音樂，每一件道具與服裝，只要是那三百人中的，都已經指明了這個戲，到第四百人爲止，簡直可以完成公演。</p>
<p>他似乎知道每一個地位，與每一個運動是什麼樣子，知道其所以然的內在原因，外形效果，觀衆的反應，這一切，他都說明給演員，並指明如何去作，一步一步一個姿式一個姿式，他把全劇動作建立起來，演員始終不動，等着梅伊荷　的運動，於是就像唸台詞一樣，他　　梅當作例子。</p>
<p>他對於整個戲劇的統制，巳使好的演員不能與他合作，同樣的，最優秀的段計者也都不願與他共事，因爲他在那裏，他們不過比工頭高一級而已。</p>
<p>梅氏是個人的，他死後，便沒有後繼者，他的貢獻，只是供給戲劇革命以動力。</p>
<p>史坦吿訴演員，應該忘却是在台上，泰說，演員要忘掉一切，梅說，演員是觀衆之一。</p>
<p>演劇力學，其實即是構成法或機械的理論對於演員之應用。他假定演員是由許多機器組成的一副頗爲奇異的機器，劇塲的新問題便是如何使這副機器能各部圓滿的活動，筋，肌，腱，代表柔靱的活栓棒，圓柱等，以其全力工作，依據由大腦沿脊髓而達於神經中樞所發的使命，而傳達其適當的意義。</p>
<p>演劇力學的法則建基在人類心理結構之研究上，此種體系，其目的在於使人明瞭其結構之機械及法則，因此而能完滿地的運用。牠已立下了一種分析的原理，以區別身體各種運動，及能完全用以表達情緒。從前的情緒的演劇論，假定人類軀體的機械是無知的，藉技巧學的敎育方式，以訓練演員的智慧，以遊戲方法發展其身體，由此養成完全擁有身心的鍵盤的有生機的演員，及能够增加他的感召之神聖。現在演劇力學起而替代此種理論，應用演劇力學於劇塲的人，其目的在於使演員能支配自己的動作，而不是動作支配演員，這已成爲理想中的冇機人體及共機械之明證。</p>
<p>那時招貼劇是用爲鬥爭的武器的。論及這種改革，我以爲重要人物太概略化，正如廣吿的大綱一樣，他們的熱情是張貼於各隅各平面的標貼中所列之黨的標語。</p>
<p>這種劇本需要有特殊訓練的重要演員，訓練的方法如下：字旬應當在響臂而作啞音上加以重讀，此法能使人注意聲音的表情及產生氛圍氣，牠的效果心之以朗讀及歌唱方法以分斷說白，更爲有力，後來此種說白稱爲電訊式的說白。其意義即發音像標語式的說白的方式，有其獨有的完成的節奏。此種誦讀劇本的方法爲演員所應首先重視的煽動效果所決定，正如一個有經騐的政治演說家，審愼的考量其所用以感動聽衆的說話一樣，姿態亦建基於相同的理論，姿態配合聲音，正與聲音之配合意義相同，而手臂的姿態與「字句的姿態」有同一的性質，這便是需要十分艱辛研究的辛苦方法之基礎。</p>
<p>他所尋求的毋寗說是新型演員，一個能够，是準確地控制自己身體的演員，底有的動作，和張健的輕快上活潑。</p>
<p>他和心理的揍近，相距得太遠了，在改變一個八物的時候，他覺得需要一起把好和壤的特質，本着今日的階級感覺說明白和强調出來。那壞的特質必要加以誇張的描寫，好的特質必要使之精鍊而達到英雄的頂點；梅不用「經騐」或「情感」這一類字眼來思考演員、而是把演員看爲人民的監督，準備領導那些曾受他所鼓勵的大品。</p>
<p>他的基礎是建立在對照的並列之上的。所以、那悲劇和喜劇最崇高的和給殘忍地弄歪曲了的情感之混合，（完）</p>
<h3>電影唱片</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>近來我們從收音機裏所聆聽的電影唱片，往往都是些老古董，甚至於十幾年的「漁光曲」之類都給翻了出來。</p>
<p>因爲勝利將近一年，大多數的唱片公司都無法東山再起，此刻上海的唱片公司，只剩了大中華·勝利和百代，而勝利是美商的，百代是英商的，我們國商的，僅大中華一家而已。而這三家公司還沒有一張新唱片問世。</p>
<p>直到現在，大中華才出了六張唱片，周璇的「勝利建國歌」，趙丹的「勝利之歌」和「迎戰士」等。據說以後每月預計出品三張，至於百代和勝利，最近期內，大概也有新唱片問世了。</p>
<p>唱片業屬於文化事業之一種，尤其在音樂藝術方面，更對於大衆敎育有密切的關係，因此我們對唱片的推動，非努力協助不可。</p>

<h3>十三種吻　瑪麗蒙丹的經驗</h3>
<p>— 岡人</p>
<p>如果你是個幸運者的話，瑪莉能吿訴你，十三種「短吻」（Cutie）到外的吻（Kiss　os　Death）」。</p>
<p>她說：「用了她們的指尖，不！她們的唇，一個女子可以從男人那裏得到任何東西，甚至他寳貴的生命。」</p>
<p>瑪莉是被人公認爲銀幕上最熟於吻的女人。她祗用了她「倉庫」裏的四種「吻」，就把羅特，卡龍的心緊住了，這你可從她的環球新片「蒙泰利之海盜」（Pirates　of　Monterey）裏見到。</p>
<p>現在寫她口中的正文吧！</p>
<p>一·「在她表中第一種吻是「短吻」（Cutie），祗是在男子的鼻上撮起嘴吻一下。」</p>
<p>二·「面『頰撮吻』是一種充分友誼情感的表示。」</p>
<p>三·她說：「同時還有一種「交際吻」也是同樣的撮吻。</p>
<p>四·「『風吻』是空氣接吻。」</p>
<p>五·「頂聰敏而狹滑的要算是『擦耳吻』用撮起的嘴在他耳上輕輕擦過。」</p>
<p>六·「一種狡滑的吻是『手吻』給他一個唇上呼吸的接吻。」</p>
<p>七·這種吻要大量得多了，特別適用於大學校中，願意地給予，不過比較匆促。」</p>
<p>八·「後面一種就是『頂吻』在對方頂上發出一種吻聲，這特別適用於可愛的爸爸。」</p>
<p>以後瑪莉小姐就談到比較認真的吻了。</p>
<p>九·「頸吻」（Neck）一時在熱愛中的人們，吊在臂上的女郎，可以仰起她的頭，輕經地在他耳下的頸上一吻。」</p>
<p>十·這一吻應該是「愛人吻」（Loves）了，那常和熱烈的擁抱同時那時沒有什麽，祗有愛！」</p>
<p>十一·「和愛人吻相仿的是「未婚夫吻」（fiance）這比較更謹愼一些。」</p>
<p>十二·「丈夫吻」（Hasban）就是一個妻子給予丈夫的。</p>
<p>十三·末一個是「Whamdodie」普通用的。</p>
<p>最後，就是『死的吻』了·」</p>
<p>「義犬尋主」是一部以英國爲背景的五彩片，寫一條犬與一個孩子的故事。賴茜是那孩子深深愛護的一條家犬，某次爲一伯爵所奪，飼養在奢侈舒適的犬籠裏。但它寗願放棄這錦衣美食而不爲人所關切的生活。終於脫逃，回到了它的幼主的簡陋的家庭</p>
<p>這是一張感人的影片，吿訴人們畜牲對人類的忠愛誠摯。據悉，米高梅公司決將此片自六日前後獻映於全市慈祥的市民之前，代上海萬國護畜會呼籲：「愛護牲畜。」</p>
<h3>一週電影短評</h3>
<p>— 祝西</p>
<p>這一週間，沒有特別好的片子，惟「七重心」尚佳，但它在處理的技巧上並沒有多大的造就。</p>
<p>血路</p>
<p>劇本雖然欠强，類如神話，但這是屬於宣傳性的，情有可願。因爲導演剪接的靈活，使這片成爲本週各片之冠，自開幕至飛機被迫降落，是無懈可擊的。當然缺點也有，主要是巧的機會太多所致。演員以至倫海爲最佳，手脚乾凈可愛。埃洛爾茀林反平平。</p>
<p>我們的時代</p>
<p>劇本生硬，後部的抗戰與前部的銜接欠佳，導演對幾個小　頭處理的極佳，像酒店中一對情侶飲至深晚三點半的一段，很好。幾次在片中的畫面上加上細細的姻絲或姻圈，合理而佳，很新頴。後部抗戰一段太潦草，是失敗的地方，演員伊黛露碧諾極好，內中還有一個配角，老頭兒麥可契柯夫演來比伊黛更好，保爾亨利未見高明。</p>
<p>七重心</p>
<p>散文似的處理，尚欠平穩，鏡頭欠有新感覺，但其開幕一段極佳，沒說一句話。演出一段戲，配音也在水準以上的，採用名曲也是他們的一個聰明辦法，演員方面，詹姆士梅遜未如理想，安吐德很努力。</p>
<p>天涯海角</p>
<p>戲的連貫，不能說爲純熟，克拉克藍博也祗是幾個小動作可取，拉娜透納則很嗲，前部優於後部，她演一個以媚與美取悅於男子的熱女郎是很適合的，今日她在好萊塢的走紅，在此片中很可看出其底細之一二，導演方面就是最後的結束是抓住觀衆的，其他都平平。後部在河內的一段更不及前段。</p>
<p>舞榭尤物</p>
<p>塲面不够偉大，輕鬆不够活潑，祗是　着演員的幫忙，約翰潘恩沒戲，蓓蒂昔蘭賓還稱職，維多麥丘的情念姿態却不壞，導演方面，介紹蓓蒂的出塲最糟，而蓓蒂表演「形與影的拳擊舞」的一段最好，結束嫌欠强。</p>
<p>綠林豪俠</p>
<p>故事的構造是特別的，主角不是英雄，近於懑漢，但是演出上不能說有多大的成功，導演取景暗沉的塲面太多，有壓低觀衆喜悅心理之弊，演員買萊古拍沒有發揮，洛　泰揚極佳，尤以鎗殺舊情人後的一回身內心之痛苦全部外　，為新進明星所不及。</p>

<h3>藝術的否定</h3>
<p>— 墨萸</p>
<p>魯迅曾經以半生的精力用於揭發我們同胞的愚眛與無知，可是到現在爲止，我們還是看見有很多專事批評別人作品的人在領導着這種風氣的蔓延，這至少可以說是這個時代裏的沉痛的悲劇。</p>
<p>前幾天幾張海派報紙上不斷地對高甜心甚至劉獅等的作品寫出過不少近似漫駡的文章，我們對於這種文字本身的褒貶固然無可厚非，不過我們感覺到批評者對存在於這個時代裏的藝術本格作一種根本的否定，是非常使人悵惘的。</p>
<p>在抗戰的激流中承受了八年苦難的中國，藝術也和其他政治經濟一樣內包着一種完整的支離：支離並不會使我們失望，因爲它祇是藝術工作者在一段長時期的辛酸的洗鍊以後所發洩出來的傾訴和記錄，這作爲一個動亂時代過程中的記錄正和法國大革命後藝壇上有過一個短暫的紛囂一樣，它必將終於因這些藝術工作者在掙脫黑暗以後追求光明的熱烈而仍會表現出完整來的。中國現在還在生活指數有着五千倍的時代裏掙扎，藝術工作者還不能不持續地向支配着自己命運的饑餓去搏鬥，我們要逼緊他們去寫出像蕭邦那樣完整的旋律和樂章在目前實在是不可能的。</p>
<p>我對高劉諸氏的作品看到不多，但是他們孜孜於藝術工作的虔誠至少是够人　往的。在這黃金至上的商業社會裏，人們對拿起筆桿來在白紙上塗上幾筆，寫下幾句的玩意都感到淡漠了，唯其如此，這種吃草的工作纔更足珍惜；不久的將來，這二十世紀的時代藝術必然會有他的光輝而完整的前途的，我們正需要有人來零碎地但很嚴肅地面向着這浩渺的行程去肺路，那怕他是搬運了一堆泥砂，或是檢放了幾粒石塊，他都可以算是爲了這時代的藝術未來盡了他最善的努力。</p>
<p>中國的藝術成就本來有着一個非常輝煌的過去，但是可恨的是連這點僅有的成就也曾爲同胞們的無知與愚眛所否定，剛勝利時美兵初來上海沉緬於那許多眩目的中國刺繡與精巧的手工品，就爲一般批評家們旁敲側擊的諷刺過，這是一個有力的明證，這說明了我們的無知與愚眛已斵傷了我國藝術的自信和傳統；我們一方面驚嘆外國博物院裏陳列着甚至我們唐宋以前的藝術作品的偉大和孤詣，但一方面却在有意無意地要來企岡鏟掉自己國內新興藝術的記程碑，這是不是現在這個時代裏的沉痛的悲劇呢？這又是不是我們同胞以及批評者的可恥的無知和愚眛呢？</p>
<p>我曾經看見過幾個學生獻身於新聞事業的前輩，每天化了很多時間去研讀評選別人甚至後進的作品，一篇又一篇地，那麼仔細，毫不厭倦，絕不主觀；他把整個生命和活力都寄托在藝術的舖路工作上面，這種對藝術肯定而嚴肅，誠摯而虔敬的精神是值得使我們警惕的，因爲這時代裏不是正瀰漫着浮囂的專事否定別人藝術作品的風氣嗎？</p>
<p>陶淵明因爲一篇「閑情賦」被人目爲白璧之玷，朱淑貞因爲兩句「月上柳梢頭，人的黃昏後」而避了不貞的物議，我終覺得這是歷史上多餘的一頁；我們應該記住中國的藝術作品還在喘息，還很貧乏，歷史是前進的，我們不應該用古老的無知與愚昧來否定，來窒息它的行程。</p>
<h3>文藝作品裏面的大團圓</h3>
<p>— 蔣星煜</p>
<p>明淸兩朝的才子佳人小說往往是依了「私訂終身後花園，落難公子中狀元」的公式而寫成的，大抵是先前潦倒不堪，隨後或得意於功名，或得寵於當道於是三房四妾，榮歸故里，顯祖而耀宗，寫到這裏，故事也就不再繼續發展下去了；我們常常把這一稱公式化的結束筆法，稱之謂大團圓。才子佳人小說最致命的傷口就是大團圓，然而庸俗的小市民歡迎這一套，欣賞道一套，這一問題值得我們縝密地研究。</p>
<p>中國人對於「終」這個字非常重視，書經裏而把「考終命」也列爲洪範五福之一，意思是說人將死的一霎那能够自自在在沒有痛苦，也算是一種幸福，所以下層社會發生口角時，也常以「不得好死」互相賭咒；不但對人，對事也講究這個「終」字，快散席才上精采的菜，名角的戲都在壓軸，因此對於文藝作品也固執地要求一個圓滿的結束。五四以前中國沒有產生過易卜生的「娜拉」那種問題作品，因爲答案要讀者去思索，根本就不成其爲結束了。</p>
<p>市民階層之所以欣賞大團圓，並不是不能理解的，他們藝術的修養比較缺乏，興趣也比蛟低級而仄狹，他們化了錢買一本書或一張戲票，目的是在娛樂自己，使自己的情緒和肌肉放鬆放鬆，旣然化了錢，還要賠眼淚似乎是不合算的事；有藝術修養的人則不同，他們能欣賞幽默的「唐吉訶德」，也能欣賞悽愴的「冰島漁夫」，因爲這同是生活的眞實，正像甜和苦同是滋味一樣。</p>
<p>辛亥革命以還，狀元宰相之類早成了歷史上的名詞，到五四運動發生，婦女運動者又暴露了三房四妾底家庭制度之不健全不道德，於是大團圆也變了質，故事的結尾往往是甲先生與乙女士　乘康脫膚梭號郵船到香港去渡蜜月去了，或是「歌聲盪漾在山谷裏，春天是我們的」等等，到抗戰發生，大團圆又滲透到抗戰文　裏來，作品的結東千遍一律地是城市克復，鬼子死光，漢奸被活捉游擊隊受着民衆的歡呼，公式旣然立出，作品免不了定型，結果，產生了所謂「抗戰八股。」</p>
<p>假使說作家完全是爲了迎合市民階層的讀者或觀衆而來個大團圓，實際上倒也不盡盡然，我們試從作家底本身來觀察一番：一般人只有在夢裏得到缺陷的補償—精神上物質上的安慰，所以乞丐夢見白米飯，旅人夢回故鄕，這是完全潛意識的，而作家除潛意識的夢之外，還可以有一種意識的安慰方法，那就是他的作品；當初寫才子佳人的一批侖途多舛的書生，就把自己想像成書中的男主角，不用說寫來文章比班馬，相貌賽宋潘，倚嬌妻美妾，住樓台亭榭，最後萬分圓滿地結束，原是變態心理在作祟。想從現實世界逃避出來，用這種方法自我欺騙自我滿足的。</p>
<p>我們之所以要批判大團圓的傾向，並不是否認世界上的某一些事情有圓滿地吿一段落的可能性，而是因爲在不同的時間不同的空間裏面絕不會毫無變化地重演這事情，而是因爲作家由於生活經騐的極度貧困，根本只是瀕概念和慕倣來創作；就不談它的內容，不談它的意識，在技巧上也不可能形象化。</p>
<p>大團圓的傾向含孕着宿命論機械論的哲學，以爲一切都是侖運　定的了，一切都是神靈在那裏支配好了，於是才子必定風流，員外必定勢利、佳人必定多情，丫頭必定牽綫，乃至游單　必定受民衆歡呼；宿命論完全漠　了事件內部的主觀條件和事物外面的客觀環境，機械論完全忘記了這個世界是在不斷地運動之中，宿命論和機械論是最淺薄最不健全的哲學。</p>
<p>另一種和大團圓相反的傾向，便是托馬斯·哈台的「還鄕」「苔絲姑娘」等等，在中國也有這一類作品，結尾總是悽凉非常，只是一片陰森的暗影，一種無可挽回的絕望，蘆焚的小說，尤其「野烏集」，把這種特點表現得最明顯，這也是宿命論機械論的哲學，也應該批判的。</p>
<p>一件事情可以有各種不同的結果，一篇小說也可以有各種不同的結束，忠實於生活的作品，決不會陷入公式化的窠臼，大團圓不是不能寫，不要勉强裝上去，套上去就是了。</p>
<h3>教堂</h3>
<p>— 鄭震刻</p>
<h3>孩子氣</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>做了人，就無形中加上了一副桎梏。——因爲是人。</p>
<p>譏諷，白眼，嘲笑，……，時時得提防。</p>
<p>偶然的人家說幾句溫情的激勉，眞像是沙漠中的甘泉，受寵若驚的幾乎淌下熱淚。但是，抬起頭來，一見的是一張虛偽的刁詐的臉時，又是多麼的憤憤。——也只是憤憤而已，再是心的怒焰，也只能蘊藏在心的最深處。</p>
<p>人與人之間，明明都是佈就的陷穽，劍拔弩張的拼個你死我活的形勢，却偏要是飾滿了一片藏滿毒藥的糖衣。</p>
<p>乾脆的打，乾脆的罵，也倒吧了，可是，不能。</p>
<p>我羨慕孩子：我羨慕孩子天眞的笑，我羨慕孩子天眞的哭，我羨慕孩子能好好惡惡。</p>
<p>可惜的是，天眞加上了矯飾，只是一片醜惡和受苦。</p>
<p>不過，究竟這誘着我，引着我，我摹傚着孩子。</p>
<p>一切的諷言諷語，我只裝做不懂，我只痴憨地笑着；我也裝作不懂的把冷箭滲入言語裏，來洩一片烏姻瘴氣的懊惱。</p>
<p>有幾個朋友說：「你還那麼大眞」，有幾個人背後批評說：「這傢伙太孩子氣」。我笑笑，不是我不懂，是我懂得太多了。我也不天眞，我也不孩子氣，這些僅是我的姻幕和面具，偽裝是痛苦，但至少能給我暫時的肆意和滿足。</p>
<p>爲什麽我不如此呢？</p>
<p>我有權利可以駡這批人們，雖然還儘有人在他周圍捧和拍，我不希望做一條可憐的小尾巴，每個人應該有自己的意志。</p>
<p>我可以爽爽快快把我的話講出來，但是，那批自以爲前輩的人們，又得放下一面孔的官腔老態：「你不懂，你還年輕」。好，也吧，索性我罩上了孩子的面具，任意的來敎訓那批人吧！</p>
<p>不過，愈是撒孩子氣，愈是明顯地覺得，孩子的氣質已經一步步遠我而去，留下的只是矯飾，那又不禁可哀的了。</p>
<h3>洋琴鬼　談舞塲音樂</h3>
<p>— 梁西延</p>
<p>一個朋友吿訴我：「這是非常傷心的事情：一個音樂天才極高的同學某君，現在竟已成了某無塲的洋琴鬼。」</p>
<p>音樂被作爲低級色情的工具是音樂的悲哀，學音樂人幹了色情爵士樂的演奏者，是樂人的末路。但社會也太刻毒，把這般舞塲「樂師」加上了洋琴鬼的名目，使他永無翻身之餘地。其實，舞塲的「樂人」，雖然極盡低級粗淺之演奏，但也未始沒有超越的天才，他們只爲了吃飯犧牲了對藝術深造機會，爲了生活，自己埋沒自己的天才。在中國管弦樂隊太不發達，一般水準低得可憐，有音樂天才者淪爲「洋奪鬼」，其實也極令人同情！</p>
<p>當然，外國也有舞塲音樂，但他們的正統音樂已經有了堅强基礎，沒有讓很多音樂的高度天才者，淪爲「洋琴鬼」。</p>
<p>上海音樂協會會經考慮過舞塲音樂的問題，但還未有具體決定。我以爲在舞塲「樂師」中提鍊出一部分確有高超天才的演奏者，讓他的藝術技能納於正軌，是一個辦法。還有，酌量提高舞塲音樂的水準，使那爵士像一個爵士，不要胡鬧得漫無止境！這也很需要！</p>
<p>爵士（Jazz），一九一四年創行於南美。原來只是利用輕快的節拍，熱鬧的旋律來刺激聽衆的神經，雖然藝術價值减少，却也不能絕對的把它檳除於音樂門外，但時至今日，這個士越來越胡調，變成一種拉雜，滑稽，純色情的東西。而在上海舞塲，尤其糟不可言。它加上了鼻腔發音的歌女獨唱，也博得了强烈的掌聲。</p>
<p>這情形會令每一個眞正愛好音樂的人心痛！我們明知舞塲音樂，有其存在的原因，但該有個尺度！不要讓優良的天才埋葬於此，不要讓這些聲音，毫無限度地破壞人們的聽覺！</p>
<h3>夏洛蒂王后</h3>
<p>— 甘斯波羅作（一七二七——一七八八）</p>
<p>陳列於倫敦維多利亞博物館</p>
<p>甘斯波羅Thomes　Gainsborough爲英國歷來最偉大的人像及風景畫家之一，生於塞特堡，童年即喜描繪故鄕附近山明水秀之風景，十四歲時至倫敦學畫早年沒沒無名，及至一七六〇年，氏遷居名溫泉區巴斯，乃因作人像畫而稍稍有名。一七七四年，至倫敦，不久即漸成當時最偉大畫家霄腦爵士之敵手，二人作風迥異，平分天下，倫敦人士之崇拜甘氏及崇拜雷氏者，亦的略各半。氏爲皇家學院創立人之一，學院首决藝展時，氏之盡即有陳列。</p>
<p>甘斯波羅之風景畫爲近代自然主義派畫風景之前騙，而其人像，尤其是女性人像，則皆具有一種輕快與優美，爲人所不及。</p>
<h3>漫談國書</h3>
<p>— 愉盧</p>
<p>國畫至於今日，流派紛繁，而正宗獨少。學殖未深，素養不足，加以時風所趨，每好以參酌西畫新法相炫，演變所屆，乃有不中不西之誚。求其形似，已　難能，神　氣息，更無論矣。若千年前，某畫家以中西畫兼長號於時，詎知評者謂某君之西畫，國人歎爲畢肖，某君之國畫，西人驚爲天才，殆未免　而虐也。然即此可知畫之眞價值，固與流俗之品評無關。</p>
<p>海上畫家，陸廉夫及山陰任氏兄弟而後，數十年間，人才輩出。張大千善子昆仲，以蜀人蜚聲江南，其他則以江浙籍爲多。此中祭酒，當推馮超然吳湖帆鄭午昌諸子。午昌山水，間學石濤，其作畫全恃靈感。湖帆之畫，以淸遠秀逸勝，而超然則以蒼老渾厚著稱，往歲狄平子最所推重。午昌近猶有潤格，而馮吳二老，則以求者過多，應接不暇。馮吳同居的山路某里，　宇相望，時以唱和爲樂，興之所至，揮亳瀟洒，終日不倦。惟馮畫，問有　鼎。曾有以他人　擬之作詢之於馮者，彼則莞爾笑曰，自有識者鑒別，何必介意乎？馮於山水花鳥人物仕女，無所不工，近年則以山水爲多，筆力　勁，而佈局精細。聞六月初旬之上海美協展覽會·馮氏獨無作品參與。會中所借得高懸之水墨一幅，殆　　耳。</p>
<h3>日曜日</h3>
<p>— 喬治·吉辛作　馬御風譯</p>
<p>喬治·吉辛（George　Gissing）是近代英國作家，「日曜日」譯自「越氏私記」（The　Private　Papers　of　Henry　Ryecroft），這本書，蜚聲士林，有人還說是十九世紀英文散文中最淸歷的作品。</p>
<p>日曜日我比平常　起了，我更換衣服，因爲在精神的安息日裏，脫去平常的工作服是很適當的。的確，我日常是沒有什麼工作，可是，日曜日也帶給我安靜。我沉浸在世間的靜寂之中，我的思想比平常更完全地脫離了勞碌的世界。</p>
<p>我這座房子，怎樣在室內做出曜日的靜寂來呢？這是很難看見的，因爲牠平常是寂靜得好像一點聲音也沒有。不過，我自己可以看得出他的不同。傭婦帶着日曜日的很笑走到我房裏來，她在這天顯得更加幸福了，而她的幸福的樣子也使我高興。她用比平常更加溫柔的聲音說話，她穿的衣服，使我覺得在我家裏只有最簡單最淸潔的工作。早上和晚上她都到禮拜堂去，我知道這對於她十分好的。在她外出的時候，我時常到平日不進去的屋裏巡視。眞的，在善良的婦人的領域之內，發亮的潔凈和井然的秩序使我的眼睛覺得喜悅。如果沒有那個淸凈無垢的廚房，我放着書掛着圖畫又有什麽用處呢？我生活上的一切安靜，都倚託這個婦人的誠實的照顧，她在我看不見的地方生活和工作。我給她的報酬，我相信是她所受的報酬的最小部份。她是一個舊式的婦人，執行以爲是自己的義務的工作，在她看來就是目的，在她手裏所完成的工作本身，就是她的滿足和誇耀。</p>
<p>在孩童時代，日曜日我被准許展讀一些平日不能隨便　動的書籍，這是有美麗插畫的書籍，或是名家的精裝本，或是因爲本子厚要特別注意的。幸而這些書全是屬於高級文學的東西，因此，在詩文上最偉大的名字和安息日之問，在我的心裏築成不可分離的聯想。這種習慣我終身保留着。我常常想靜靜地消度我的日曜日的一份時間在書籍上，這些書，平常是容易拋開的，爲了寵好新刋書的悅目，便以對於牠們的智識和愛好作為託詞而忽視她們了。荷馬和魏吉爾，彌爾頓和沙士比亞，在過去的日曜日裏，我沒有翻閱這些人的作品的日子，實在不多。不是許多日曜日？不，這是人容易陷於誇張的習慣，不如說我在許多日曜日，曾經發見這樣的讀書的心情和機會。就是今天，心情和機會也決不會撇棄我。當我高興的時候，我可以拿下我的荷馬或我的沙士此亞。可是，要想和這些書結成特別的朋友，我覺得還是日曜日最適當。因爲這些戴着不朽的榮冠的偉人，是不允許熱中於　世的勞碌的人去接近他們的。嚴肅悠閒的態度和趨向和平的思想，是和牠相宜的。我有幾分形式地翻着畫册，如果神聖這個字有什麼意義，這不是神聖的嗎？當我讀書的時候，沒有什麽障碍能顯露在我的面前。紅雀的歌聲，蜜蜂的嗡嗡，這就是圍繞我的聖殿的聲音。翻動書葉時，幾乎一點聲也沒有。</p>

<h3>偶語</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>天有不測風雲，人有旦夕禍福。在現在看起來，並不是渺茫無稽，也不是什麽神的主使，而完全有其科學的根據的。</p>
<p>像昨前兩天的天氣，不僅熱，而且悶，無論熱或悶，其來也但暴。凡事象的走勢暴者，其立勢必不穩，這其間必網之以突變。</p>
<p>一個人暴富，他的生活狀態決不會平衡安素，他的家庭，他的個人，往往會發生許多過去所未有，或是想像不到的事熊出來。原因就在於偶然的不正常。天人本來也是同一道理。所謂風雲，所謂禍福，決不是憑空而來的。</p>
<p>記得豐子愷先生曾闡述過「漸」的哲學，防微杜漸，「漸」的確是個最可怕的妖魔，在不知不覺中，在日常生活中，牠會完成其根深蒂同的勢力。但牠發作時，我往往當作是不測，當作是旦夕，在形式上似乎是如此，其實由來已久矣。</p>
<p>因之，我們生活上所出現或遭遇到的事，我們正不必大驚小怪，仔細一想是不難尋出它的綫索來的。</p>
<h3>化學工業的艱苦鬥爭　永利公司的過去與現在</h3>
<p>— 凡士</p>
<p>談到中國的化學工業，我們不由得想起故世將近一年的范旭東先生及其一手創辦盡瘁半生的永利化學工業公司。</p>
<p>從久大鹽號到永利公司，從民國三年到抗戰前夕，范先生數十年的奮鬥努力，非但他個人的事業獲得了輝煌的成就，新中國的化學工業也由他而異彩四射，永利公司在他主持之下，分設南北兩廠，北廠在河北塘沽，製造純鹼。南廠在江蘇六合卸甲甸，製造硫酸錏。前者是紙和玻璃的原料，後者是人造肥料的主要成份。這兩種重要的出品十幾年來替國家挽回了多少的利權。然而，當人們正對他對永利寄予更大的希望時，七七的砲聲響了。</p>
<p>砲聲響了，北廠南廠相繼陷入敵手，艱苦卓絕的范先生率領他的部下跋涉到了四川。舊的失去了，新的再開始。在五通橋，又一個鹼廠建立起來，雖然規模不大，但是在抗戰期間，它也盡了不小的力量。在貧乏簡陋的物質條件下，他們忍耐着，工作着。</p>
<p>嚴重的打擊</p>
<p>勝利以後，永利公司正可大有作爲的時候，范先生却在去年十月裏因病去世了。這當然是一個重大的打擊，不過所幸他奠下的基礎已經相當鞏固，而他的朋友和部下也已經挑起了他所遺下的担子。</p>
<p>現在永利公司的情形怎樣呢？昨天記者蒙該公司副總經理李倜夫先生的接見，在他們的會客室裏作了一番長談。</p>
<p>他說，南北兩廠都已經接收過來了，裏而的設備都有些損失。北廠已在今年二月問復工，每天純鹼的產量約在九十噸左右。南廠則目前還在整理中，復工的僅有一小部份、製出的祗是少量的硫酸。爲什麽南廠遲遲至今還不能完全復工？主要的原因在於焦炭與煤的來源成問題，在戰前，南廠一向靠山東棗莊的小興煤礦公司供給，但是棗莊現在已經在共產黨軍隊的控制之下了。公司當局曾經考慮到去開　買煤，可是運輸非常困難，迫不得已，祗好向加拿大定貨，煤質是比國產的好，但是價錢可就貴得多。</p>
<p>因爲這種原因，加上工資和運費的昂貴，目前外貨的市價，要比他們的出品便宜達百分之二十。</p>
<p>準備遷上海</p>
<p>不過，因為外貨到的還不多，他們出品的銷路目前還算不差，尤其上海和華北一帶的納胃較旺，如果各有工人一千餘名的南北兩廠都能恢復正當的狀態，北廠每天純　的產量可以增加到二百噸，南廠的硫酸錏也可以日產一百五十噸，此外抗戰期間在四川五通橋的鹼廠，現在也還繼續在生產，雖然每天不過二三頓而已。</p>
<p>現在永利公司的負資人是侯德榜·李倜夫·范鴻疇·余嘯秋四位先生，他們正預備把總公司遷到上海來；並且計劃把全國分成東南西北中五區，分別在上海廣州重慶天津漢口等地設立分公司。</p>
<p>「但是，一切的發展與計劃還得看國家的安定交通的暢達和物價的平抑這三大因素而決定。政府對於永利，也沒有什麼扶助的表現，祇不過在資金的週轉上，國家銀行一向予以相當的便利而已。」這是李先生最後對記者說的感慨深長的談話。</p>
<h3>傭人難服侍</h3>
<p>— 墨</p>
<p>妻帶了兩個孩子從內地來，好容易託朋友找到了兩間房子，安頓以後，忽然想起需要僱用一個女媽子，這本是妻的事兒，但因牠人地生疏，於是我親自出馬</p>
<p>在××衛的　頭店裏女傭堆裏揀到一個面貌老誠，衣着乾淨約模卅歲左右的女子，我與她在店裏足足相對站了半小時，談判（不，不是談判，是她考問我！）的經過情形如下：</p>
<p>「你家住那裏？」她問：</p>
<p>「住××街，××號」，我答。「幾間屋子」？</p>
<p>「兩間」</p>
<p>「幾人？」</p>
<p>「連我四個，我的太太，還有兩個孩子。」</p>
<p>「飯要不要我燒？」</p>
<p>「自然要的。」</p>
<p>「一天吃好多頓？」</p>
<p>「三頓，」</p>
<p>「菜呢？」</p>
<p>「你去買？」</p>
<p>「衣服呢！」</p>
<p>「亦要你洗！」</p>
<p>「模板一星期擦幾次？」</p>
<p>「二次！」</p>
<p>「兩間屋子是不是都要我擦？」</p>
<p>「當然！」</p>
<p>「事情太多了！工錢非九萬元不可。」</p>
<p>「我出你七萬元吧！」</p>
<p>「不成，」她一會兒：「太太可歡喜打牌？」</p>
<p>「歡喜的！」我知道她的用意了，「差不多天天有一桌！」</p>
<p>「對！那就是嘛！喔先生，還有每月要給我吃葷四次一次一斤肉！」</p>
<p>「就依你，」</p>
<p>「走嘛！」</p>
<p>「就這樣走，你可不拿舖蓋？」</p>
<p>「舖蓋？沒有！要你先生製給我的。」</p>
<p>我叫了二輛車子，拉到我家裏，我給她介紹了我的太太，她在兩間屋子裏，上上下下視察了一週，忽問：「我睡在那兒？」「我們這見地方太小了，你夜上打舖就睡在這客堂裏吧！」太太說。</p>
<p>「那不成！先生！我不幹！請你給我回去的車錢！」我忍不住的腦火，像趕狗般的將她趕出了門，她在門外駡着。</p>
<h3>變</h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>八年來變化無窮，虛榮與享樂畢竟改變了她。</p>
<p>廿七年春夏間，在高郵湖畔的游擊大本營裏，我第一次看見了她，祗不過九歲，一個尚未成年，而天眞，活潑，聽　，伶俐的小孩子：從此，她永遠刻在我的記憶中。</p>
<p>因爲忙於趕赴前錢，不容許我有片刻的時間待在後方，當然也無法去打聽她的身世，只是在腦海中留着這可愛的孩子印象。</p>
<p>兩月後，我奉命調回總部工作，因此，又給我一個機會再會到她。這一次，可認識了她了。原來她就是我們一個女同志的妹妹。我鄭重地對她說：「你是一個極可愛的孩子，自己要好好的努力！未來之造就未可限量，」我用這句話來鼓勵她。我想，這個孩子的思想太高超了，將來一定是了不起的人物。同時我又用極眞誠友誼的口吻，勸吿她的姊姊：「這個唯一小妹妹你必須全副的精神來培植她！」</p>
<p>我的心坎裏幻想着詩意的夢，我希望她成為世界上的神童。當這許多話還停留在思憶中，又閃電似地度過了兩年。兩年來，她依舊沒有變，一直在前進中。廿九年的初夏，我爲了要追求一種眞理一種理想而離開了蘇北。臨行匆匆，僅見了她一面。我只說了一句話：「把握寳貴的光陰，埋頭苦幹！」她好像是一個耶穌敎徒，聽取上帝講道似的神情望着我，留給我最後的回憶。</p>
<p>五六年來，我奔馳在南北戰塲，走遍半個中國，在行軍戰門，宿營，學習，被捕……等許多空間與時間中。我始終還記着這一位好孩子，我相信她。我有着這個神秘的小天使。在這悠長的歲月中，我僅收到她一封信，信中很率直坦白，她吿訴我高中快舉業了我很高興，我用了一封很簡短的信，又去鼓勵她，那是卅三年的事。全面勝利果　來到，我眞是喜得如火山爆炸似地狂，我默默地自語：「這個可愛的孩子不久就可以重逢了。」</p>
<p>隨着勝利而復員，我到了南京又轉到揚州，馬上揉聽她的下落她確是住在紅色勢力包圍下之寨州，我很想看她，可是，必須通過紅色的特區，我不敢冒這無謂的險，時間的限制，我又搭上火車到了上海，我依舊懷念着她</p>
<p>三月後，接到老友來信，信中云：「莉薇已非昔日，人大志變，月前已與葉副師長同居，赴京轉漢矣！」我接到這封信，爲之一震，如同高樓失足！</p>
<p>醒來，已是次日之黎明，我在花園中散步，不由地觸景生情，我靜靜地想太陽與空氣，八年來給我的印象，一直是沒有變，只有花園中的花，已淺凋零落啊！難怪人也變了！</p>
<p>記得初次看見她是一個九歲的孩子，前途茫茫聖潔可愛，不料，抗戰的後五年她變了！她的朋友告訴我：「她有兩種人生觀，一種是刻苦耐勞努力前途，一種是奢侈浮華，盡量享樂，現在，她畢竟走上了後一條路。</p>
<h3>「而」</h3>
<p>— 珊詩</p>
<p>中學生做文言文，時常用錯虛字。有一個學生因爲屢次濫用「而」字，他的國文敎師改得不勝其煩，於是在文末加以的批語：</p>
<p>「當而而不而，不當而而而，而今而後，已而已而！」</p>
<p>“這裏有房子出租嗎？”</p>
<p>“有的。儂條子有哦？”</p>
<h3>天下烏鴉一般黑</h3>
<p>— 方君</p>
<p>天下烏鴉一般黑，可香港業主的顏色却有點不同，要不是在香港住過的人，再也想像不出香港業主壓迫住客的手段。以前，有了法律上的優先保障，業主便是住客的一個魔頭，厥後政府把加租迫遷條例公佈了出來，住客略爲在法律上可以鬆一口氣，但，其他的壓迫並不會放鬆，在香港居住的人，如非自己是業主還得要嘔許許多的氣。</p>
<p>現在迫遷的條例還沒由政府公佈廢止，住客依然可以作爲唯一的護符，可是，業主如要徵回某一所住樓轉租別人時，某一所現有的住客就要寢饋不安了。第一，業主故意造成法律的根據，不上門收房租，送到步也托詞不予接納；其次便是不理水費，水費通知單到了業主的手裏，業主置若罔問，延不交付，讓水務當局將水喉割斷，停止食水供給。此外給與住客的麻煩很多，積極地，消極地用出種種的方法來要那一所住樓的住客不堪忍受而放棄了住的權利爲止。</p>
<p>香港正鬧着屋荒，住的問題相當嚴重。這原故是在戰爭期間破壞了不少，由內地復員的人增加，最近更由上海南來的人又如過江之鯽，這便鬧成了屋荒的基本現象。屋荒直接給與業主一個黃金的機會，有破壞樓宇的加以修葺，修葺之後將之出租，承租的條件是補償業主對這樓宇的修葺費幾多千元，房租則照戰前加上五倍甚至於十倍。完好的住樓便用上述種種的方法迫使舊有住客遷移，轉租新住客，其條件是轉租籍手續費幾多千元（約五千元之諧）新訂租值則爲加一倍以至兩倍。</p>
<p>業主如此的猖獗是因爲有一班人在助紂爲虐，謹助紂爲虐裏撈他們的水頭。但租務糾紛調解處是辦理不來的，不是辦理不來，而是法律上的固執要有人證或者物證。敗訴者往往是吃了證據不足的虧，而業主却又來一次「袋袋」平安了·</p>
<p>所以養成業主的兇燄，和業主對於住客的冷酷與傲慢，在初是以前法律對他們有過理的保障；香港貧苦大衆太多，要稅居的人佔全數十分之九五以上，這九五以上的住戶懂得法律的人太少，甘於業主的壓榨的人又太多；這「甘於」，他們自己的解釋是不好生事，然而人家却在他們的頭上生事了。這我認爲是所以養成業主底兇燄的最大因素。然而，這也難怪他們不好「生事」的，因爲業主是太平紳士的居多，太平紳士在香港是何等威風，又何况香港社會有與其的大大不同之處。</p>
<p>香港的業主是得大獨厚的，其中好幾位而且在香港的歷史中是有他們的一頁的人物，住客如攫其鋒，怕不粉身碎骨？但，戰前的加租迫遷條例給他們的玩笑也許開得太大了，好些業主對此都很不滿；可是，在住客方面，却希望政府對住屋問題公佈一個更民主的「法則。」</p>
<h3>上海之聲　新生的上海市政府交響樂園</h3>
<p>— 西延</p>
<p>音樂是文明國家的一大重要事件。</p>
<p>勝利後，上海已有過盛大的演奏；但作爲上海唯一交響樂團的市府樂隊，却是在最近才完成其改組與新生。</p>
<p>錢，一切問個的焦點，市府樂隊在工部局時代有過很充裕的經費，因而成就不算小。但當這樂隊改組爲市府交響樂團後，一度經費拮据，樂師生活無以維持，練習時旣沒有勁兒，演奏時也就難於得心應手了；因爲弄音樂，畢竟先要生活安定，却不像文章窮而後工。現在，經費問題暫吿段落，吳市長每月允撥二千萬元作爲經費，每一樂師薪金每月的三十萬元。這樣子，他們生活稍見安定，可以專心於藝術了。他們在每星期二及星期五的上午九時半至十一時半，在逸園作經常練習，而星期三及星期六的下午八時半至十時半則舉行公開演奏·座價分三等：二千元（普通），三千元（中排）及四千元（預定）。據樂團新任主任許錦淸吿訴記者：爲求普　音樂風氣起見，他們希望公務員學生們，在該樂隊每星期二及五的練習時間，前往聽樂，那是完全免費的。</p>
<p>這樂隊的前身爲工部局樂隊，所以現有的洋基礎，還是人家爲我們建立的。雖然已冠上了上海市政府交饗樂團的名月，但看一看在五十四人演奏者當中，四十六名是外籍人士，眞使我們不勝顏汗！不過，現在已經增多了中國人了；在從前，工部局樂隊中只有馬思宏·陳又新等三個華人，說來愧死！現在，有兩個第一小提琴手，三個第二小提琴手，兩個中普提琴手，一個喇叭手都是中國人。據許主任說還有一個洋笛吹手也將要自渝、來滬，參加該樂隊。許先生操着法語腔的英語又說：「我們希望這交響樂團中有更多的中國人！」</p>
<p>前工部局樂隊的指揮本爲義大利人巴西（Pacy），上海的聽衆對他都很熟悉，他那兩手分開作不同拍子的指揮，早爲許多人所讚美。但現在他已因故退出樂隊，目前的指揮是一個俄籍的司婁茨（Sloursky）先生，也富有經騐與修養。他的優點是不作那些無謂的花樣，去分散聽衆的注意力。</p>
<p>我曾聽了他們的第八次演奏，許多節目都是很普通而很有名的小品，沒有交響樂，想來是爲了生意經。不過，對於上海的聽衆，我以爲暫時避免太多嚴重的節目，而稍顧到觀衆的興趣，也未可厚非·有一點感覺，逸園那個樂台的設備，恐怕對音量的損失也不少。露天對於規模較小的樂隊，常使其音量散失，尤其插有小提琴及大提琴獨奏時，簡眞聲音變成很　弱了·這些話也許都係「冒充內行」之談，不知對否。</p>
<p>印話</p>
<h3>寫篆</h3>
<p>— 高甜心</p>
<p>刻印必先寫篆，以求篆體之筆法，字法。古人趙凡夫有言，「今人不會寫篆字，如何有好印？」此實至語。又葉爾鎧說，「印之所貴者文，若不究心於篆，而工意於刀，惑也。」蓋印人與工匠之別，亦在篆體之不同耳。</p>
<p>寫篆先習　山碑，（有正書局出版）、泰山刻石，（藝苑　賞社出版），以求筆畫遒勁。次寫石鼓文，（有正書局中華書局珂羅版），求結構之秀美。復臨鐘，鼎，彝器，原拓片，得其情趣。</p>
<p>鐘鼎拓片之佳者，莫如散氏盤。廣藝舟雙楫評曰：「蒼古則三公山，妙麗則碑額，奇偉則天發神讖，雅健則封禪國山，茂密渾勁莫如少室，開母，此皆希世之鴻實也。」（印文：馮玉祥之鉢）</p>

Soon after, he and his wife went to the residence of U.S. Ambassador Stuart to visit Ambassador Stuart, talking for several tens of minutes. Then, he and Ambassador Stuart went to pay respects to Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Kuling 3rd Dispatch] Special Envoy Marshall arrived in Kuling from Nanjing at 6:30 p.m. on the 3rd, marking his third time up the mountain. His wife still greeted him at Xiaotianchi. Pi Zonggan, a military adjutant of the National Government, came along. At the entrance of Kuling Street, Marshall smiled and nodded to the reporters who came to greet him to express his thanks, and then went directly to No. 40 Hexi Road to rest.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kuling 3rd Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart has now recovered. However, according to his nurse, she told reporters that although the Ambassador has recovered from his illness, he still cannot overexert himself. He is expected to return to Nanjing in the middle of next week.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 2nd Dispatch] Special Envoy Marshall left Nanjing by plane at 2 p.m. on the 3rd. Before his departure, he met with Zhou Enlai again, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Afterwards, according to the Communist Party, Zhou stated to Marshall that the bombing of Yan'an by seven planes on the 2nd of this month was an unprecedentedly serious incident, but because instructions from Yan'an had not arrived, he was unwilling to express any opinion for the time being. Secondly, Zhou believed that the fighting that occurred in Shandong today was a "large-scale offensive by the National Army." After Zhou left, Marshall had a meal and then spoke to Yu Weitong by telephone, inquiring about the government planes flying to Yan'an. Marshall then flew from Nanjing at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Kuling 3rd Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart Leighton Stuart successively received Wyatt, the British Prime Minister's personal representative, Peng Xuepei, the Minister of Propaganda, and Bell, the propaganda advisor of the National Government, at his residence on the 3rd. The Ambassador expressed his gratitude to Minister Peng for the concern shown by all parties during his illness. The Ambassador was in good spirits today, walking with a cane outside the gate of his residence by the stream with the murmuring sound of the spring, looking relaxed and at ease. When reporters asked the Ambassador, "Have you recovered?" the Ambassador smiled and said, "I'm fine. Thank you." Also, Chuan Jingbo, the Ambassador's personal advisor, has been feeling unwell due to his hard work during the Ambassador's illness. The Ambassador has transferred Ms. Weidman, his embassy secretary, from Nanjing to Kuling for three days to replace him in his work.</p>
<p>[United Press Kuling 3rd Dispatch] U.S. Ambassador to China Leighton Stuart stated when he met with reporters in his sickbed on the 3rd: He feared that the attack on U.S. troops near Peiping would delay the resumption of peace talks. Ambassador Stuart had a slight fever, but according to the U.S. military police officer, his condition was progressing well and he would be able to recover after a few more days of rest. Stuart expressed his opinion on the political situation, saying: "Although the current situation is not very optimistic, there is absolutely no reason to be pessimistic." When reporters asked what steps the U.S. government would take regarding the attack on the Navy in Anping Yanghai, Stuart and General Cooke, the U.S. Commander in China who was here for a short visit, both replied: A decision could only be made after receiving the investigation results and a detailed report. Cooke refuted the Communist claim that U.S. troops had launched an attack first, and said: He would exchange information on the case with Chairman Chiang.</p>
<h3>General Cooke to Arrive in Shanghai Today; Yesterday Invited by the Chairman to Tour Hanpokou; The Attack on U.S. Troops to Be Dealt with Reasonably and Fairly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kuling 3rd Dispatch] It is heard that Special Envoy Marshall, Ambassador Stuart, and General Cooke will discuss countermeasures on the evening of the 3rd or the morning of the 4th based on the reports they have received from various parties regarding the attack on U.S. Marines in North China. Although Special Envoy Marshall's serious expression was the same as before when he ascended Lu Mountain for the third time on the 3rd, his resolute and calm demeanor was unusual. It is generally believed that the U.S. will clearly state its attitude towards the "Anping Incident" within days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kuling 3rd Dispatch] U.S. Commander in China General Cooke is scheduled to leave Kuling for Shanghai via Qingdao with his wife and children at 9 a.m. on the morning of the 4th. General Cooke met with reporters from this newspaper at 3 p.m. on the 3rd and said that he would meet with Marshall on the evening of the 3rd. Regarding the attack on U.S. troops on the Peiping-Tianjin Highway, Cooke said: He had received reports that it was carried out entirely by Communist troops, but which area's Communist troops it was was still awaiting further detailed reports. Mr. and Mrs. Cooke, etc., were invited by Chairman Chiang and his wife at 6:40 p.m. on the 3rd to tour Hanpokou, admire the magnificent scenery, and had a picnic there before returning at dusk.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Kuling 3rd Dispatch] This area has obtained sufficient and powerful evidence from the Peiping Executive Headquarters and the Mediation Executive Department regarding the attack on the U.S. Marines on the Peiping-Tianjin Highway, which is sufficient to explain who was responsible. In particular, the section of the highway where the incident occurred was pre-set with obstacles to prevent the advance of U.S. military vehicles. This further confirms that it was a premeditated ambush. It is heard that after Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart jointly pay respects to Chairman Chiang and exchange opinions, there will be a reasonable and fair resolution.</p>
<h3>President Song Arrives in Shanghai; Flies to Xun and Then to Lu This Morning</h3>
<p>Wei and Peng Answer Questions from Reporters Stationed in Kuling</p>

It is now learned that the draft of the treaty has been completely drafted after a long period of detailed discussion by the diplomatic authorities of China and the United States. It is heard that the highest authorities, for the sake of prudence, have specially submitted it to the Legislative Committee of the Executive Yuan for preliminary review.

<h3>Military Mediation Department Group Awaiting Guarantee; Postponing Trip to Anping for Investigation; U.S. Military Patrol in Peiping Leaves for Tianjin This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 3rd Dispatch] Regarding the attack on U.S. troops in the Anping area, the Communist Party stated that it is currently awaiting the investigation report from the special group sent by Peiping.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Peiping 3rd Dispatch] Regarding the attack on U.S. troops at Da Xiao Sha He, the U.S. side of the Military Mediation Department has not made any statement other than agreeing to send a group to the site for investigation. It seems to be awaiting instructions from the U.S. military and diplomatic authorities in China, showing unusual caution. U.S. reporters are particularly concerned about this. Cai Wenzhi's statement on this matter was fully published by the United Press without a word omitted. The Communist side sent a memorandum to the U.S. side in the name of Ye Jianying, which was roughly the same as the broadcast from Yan'an, stating that Da Xiao Sha He was a "Liberated Area" and that Anping Hexiwu was a place repeatedly contested by the National and Communist armies. No evidence was presented regarding the so-called joint National and U.S. armies. When reporters asked Chen Shiqu, the Chief of Staff of the Communist Party, about this, Chen said: The captured U.S. military truck driver was a witness, but no other evidence was presented. Chen said he had not heard of the capture of a Communist military doctor. The government side is particularly concerned about this matter. The group that the three parties agreed to send for investigation was originally scheduled to depart on the 3rd, but it did not happen. According to the Communist side, the reason was that the U.S. side requested that the Communist army in the area be notified first, that is, a reliable guarantee for the personnel of the group must be obtained first. It is also learned that the National Army has advanced to the area yesterday and, in order to protect the highway, will recover Xianghe County, which is located next to it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tianjin 3rd Dispatch] It is reported that the U.S. military authorities stationed in Tianjin have conducted a detailed investigation into the situation when U.S. troops were attacked by the Communist army on the Peiping-Tianjin Highway on the 29th. On that day, there were a total of 24 vehicles in the patrol team traveling from Tianjin to Peiping. The first four vehicles were outposts, consisting of one machine gun jeep, one communication jeep, and two automatic gun jeeps. A considerable distance behind the outposts were twelve trucks, followed by eight vehicles including army jeeps, Xingzheng trucks, and patrol cars, with a total length of 400 yards. When the outposts reached Da Xiao Sha He in Anping, they were blocked by ox carts placed as obstacles in the middle of the highway. The right front of the highway was Da Xiao Sha He Village, where there were Communist machine guns. There were also Communist machine guns in the small woods on the left front, and Communist sniper teams in the cornfields on the left rear and right rear. The Communist command post was located on the left side of the highway (east). The U.S. military vehicles were blocked by the obstacles, and immediately after stopping, they were attacked by the Communist army without warning. It is generally believed that this was a planned action.</p>
<p>[United Press Peiping 3rd Dispatch] A U.S. military patrol team of 200 men will leave Peiping for Tianjin on the morning of the 4th, but in view of the attack on the 29th of last month, they will carry full equipment to prevent accidents. The team of U.S. soldiers will carry four medium tanks and thirty other vehicles, including two radio jeeps and one radio truck. The remaining trucks will carry U.S. soldiers. The entire team of U.S. soldiers is equipped with machine guns, automatic weapons, and various other light weapons, but no artillery.</p>
<p>[United Press Tianjin 3rd Dispatch] The U.S. military here is now on high alert since the Anping incident. Barbed wire is placed at the entrances of U.S. military stations for defense, and guards are stationed at night.</p>
<h3>The Plane That Forced Landed in Northern Shaanxi a Month Ago; Destroyed by Government Planes; Action Taken Because Yan'an Refused to Hand It Over</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 3rd Dispatch] The Communist Party's Yan'an broadcast yesterday regarding the bombing has attracted attention from various parties here. At 11 p.m. on a rainy night, reporters made a special visit to the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, Chen Cheng. Chen had just returned from a banquet hosted by the U.S. Navy at the Lizi Society and was resting because he felt slightly unwell. The reporter then wrote the questions on the back of his business card and asked him to respond. Soon after, his attendant staff officer came out and told the reporter: The Chief of Staff was aware of the news of the bombing of Yan'an and would not comment on it temporarily today. The government will issue an announcement tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing 3rd Dispatch] Air Force Commander Zhou Zhirou said today that the government planes bombed Yan'an yesterday to destroy the B24 bomber that flew to Yan'an on June 26, and the bombing was successful. A spokesman for the CCP office claimed that seven planes bombed Yan'an, taking off from the Xi'an base, including six P47 fighter planes, which had recently arrived in Xi'an from Nanjing, and one B24 bomber, which strafed and bombed Yan'an for 20 minutes. According to Yan'an sources, the planes fired forward at the B24 bomber and the Communist headquarters in Yan'an, dropping 11 bombs. One of the bombs landed only 500 meters away from the office of Communist Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. The six fighter planes strafed the military area. The government B24 bomber that flew to Yan'an caught fire after being hit and was burned. According to Zhou Zhirou, he had instructed the air force bombing Yan'an to concentrate its targets on the government bomber left in Yan'an and to avoid bombing other places in Yan'an. The government bomber in Yan'an was forced to land due to a shortage of gasoline. It had been requested that the plane be returned to the government, but more than a month had passed and the request had not been accepted. Therefore, a team was sent to destroy it. Zhou Enlai was in a meeting with Special Envoy Marshall when he received the news of the bombing of Yan'an. The official news from Yan'an did not mention the number of casualties, but according to the Communist side here, the number of casualties was likely to be high. CCP spokesman Wang Bingnan said that the bombing of Yan'an was sudden and the Communist army was not prepared. There are currently two U.S. liaison officers stationed in Yan'an, one of whom is Major Yang Ge.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Peiping 3rd Dispatch] Ye Jianying sent a memorandum to the government and the U.S. today, stating that seven government planes bombed and strafed Yan'an for 20 minutes yesterday, dropping 11 bombs and firing more than 10,000 bullets. The plane piloted by Liu Shanben was also destroyed at the Yan'an airport. He requested that the Military Mediation Department report the matter to the Three-Person Committee. The Communist side denied that the Communist Party had any planes.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Food Asks Localities for Assistance; Reporting Various Abuses in Tax Collection in Kind; Listing Ten Offenses to Be Dealt with Immediately According to Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 3rd Dispatch] This year's tax collection in kind has begun, and the National Government has issued a clear order to effectively prevent abuses. The Ministry of Food, in compliance with the order, has listed ten major abuses that may occur in various stages of tax collection in kind, from collection, storage, transportation, to allocation, and has issued a general order to its subordinates to investigate and strictly prohibit them. It has also sent a telegram to the provincial and municipal governments, the supervisory commissioner offices in various regions, the temporary provincial councils, and the provincial high courts, urging them to strictly report and investigate, so as to achieve the task of tax collection in kind satisfactorily. The telegram lists the following items that should be severely dealt with: (1) The amount of tax collection, borrowing, and additional grain tax should be clearly stated on the root tickets issued by each county. If there are large heads and small tails, or if additional levies are made beyond the amount specified on the grain tickets; (2) The acceptance of tax collection, borrowing, and additional grain tax should be based on legal city-system measuring instruments as the standard. If old斗or old 秤 are used to collect more than required; (3) Collecting, borrowing, and adding to public grain, without prior approval, unauthorized conversion to cash; (4) Replacing good grain with inferior grain, or privately lending or selling it for profit; (5)斗-hands and 秤-hands using skills to collect more than required; (6) Falsely reporting collections or embezzling fines; (7) Making things difficult for taxpayers and demanding bribes; (8) Warehouse managers and transporters stealing, mixing in impurities and water, falsely reporting damages, losses, or embezzling warehouse surpluses; (9) Delaying the payment of storage and transportation fees, or deducting amounts; (10) Fathers allocating food and using illegal weights or measures, or using skills for personal gain. Any of the above ten items, if committed, will be immediately handed over to the judicial authorities for severe punishment once verified, regardless of the offender's position. Those who make false accusations out of spite will also be punished according to law.</p>
<h3>Official Washington to Issue Statement; Reaffirming U.S. Policy Toward China; Savage Says He Will Promote Our Country's Unification</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 2nd Dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Acheson stated today that he expects the U.S. government to issue a statement soon reaffirming U.S. policy toward China, making a comprehensive review of the Chinese situation. He avoided mentioning China's internal problems, only saying that there had been small clashes between U.S. Marines and the Communist army. When reporters asked Acheson what criticism he had of the Chinese situation, Acheson said: An official statement would be issued soon, and he did not wish to make any criticism at this time.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service San Francisco 2nd Dispatch] U.S. Secretary of State Hodges Savage stated at the Federal Congress here today that the U.S. steps to aid China were aimed at promoting China's unification, not supporting any party's military groups. His speech reviewed the goals of U.S. foreign policy, from isolationism to the transformation of leading international cooperation, as well as the goals of the United Nations. He said: "Building a better world is a very difficult task, and therefore the task of U.S. diplomacy is even more difficult. China, one of the countries that suffered heavy losses in the war, is our good neighbor and friend across the Pacific Ocean. We have deep sympathy for the Chinese people, who made a heroic and sustained resistance against the brutal aggressor. We hope that they will soon achieve domestic peace and unification. The various actions of the U.S. to aid China are the steps to implement an established plan to help the entire China remove the effects left by the long war against Japan. These actions must not be seen as supporting any military group of any party in China. These actions cannot be completed in three or four months. The common goal is to promote rather than destroy unification, to encourage China to solve its domestic problems through democratic methods of peaceful agreements, rather than using military force."</p>

<h3>Military Setbacks and the People: What's the Connection? In Northern Jiangsu and Northern Hebei, Communist Forces Conduct Large-Scale Dam Breaching; Twelve Counties in Hebei Become a Vast Expanse of Water; Nationalists Rush to Repair Dams, but Communist Forces Obstruct, Leading to Fierce Battles</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Military News: After launching an offensive in northern Jiangsu and suffering setbacks, the Communist forces resorted to the most cruel policy, initiating large-scale dam-breaching operations from July 31st onwards. The details of the dam breaches over the past two days are as follows: (1) A breach occurred three kilometers southwest of Lianhe Station, near Xuzhou; (2) A breach, one kilometer long, occurred at Xin'anzhen on the Shu River line, 85 kilometers southwest of Haizhou; (3) A breach occurred at Shangfangjie on the Hou Shu River line, southwest of Donghai; (4) A breach occurred at Qiaoche, 16 kilometers southwest of Haizhou. After these four dams were breached, the average flooded area ranged from 200 to 300 square kilometers. If the water continues to rise, the area will continue to expand, and countless people will die. When our reporter inquired about this matter with the Communist Party's spokespersons, they claimed that the Communist Party had never breached any dams, only that it may have been due to major dam breaks or excessive rainfall causing flooding.</p>
<p>[Northern News Report, Beiping, 3rd] Baoding Phone Call: The Communist forces in Hebei continue to breach dams everywhere, and engage in repair battles with the Nationalist forces. According to reports, the Jiuxuan Gate on the North Grand Canal and the Jinmen Gate on the Yongding River have been breached, with water flowing in all directions. The embankments of the Ziya River at Xianxian and the Ziya River at Qijia Bridge have been breached, flooding the four counties of Wen'an, Tai, Xiong, and Renqiu. It is reported that after the dike northwest of Wang Xiwei Village, six li from Cangxian, was breached, the Nationalist and Communist forces are engaged in fierce fighting at Ergang Gate to repair the dike. The Jian Gan River dike was breached in anger by the public, with floodwaters flowing into the Communist area. Currently, repair teams along the Yongding River, the North and South Grand Canals, and the Daqing River are all engaged in fierce battles with the Communist forces. The purpose of the Communist forces' dam breaching is to isolate Cangxian and cut off the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. The Hebei Provincial Government has sent another telegram to the Military Mediation Department today, requesting a cessation, and has also dispatched the Construction Director to Tianjin and Cangzhou to inspect and supervise repairs.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 2nd] In northern Hebei, the Communist forces frequently breach dikes along the North and South Grand Canals and the Ziya Daqing and other rivers. Twelve counties, including Qingyuan, Wuqing, Cangxian, and Xincheng, have been flooded. Dam-blocking efforts are proceeding under the Communist forces' rain of gunfire.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 3rd] The Communist forces in Anyang breached the Liu Xinzhuang Cao Village River embankment, causing floodwaters to flow south, inundating more than sixty villages.

<h3>Financial Chaos Caused by the Discontinuation of Red Army Currency in the Northeast; Various Trade Associations Present Six Demands</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 2nd] The recovery of various areas in the Northeast and the discontinuation of 100-yuan Red Army currency from the first of the month have caused immense financial chaos. Many businesses have announced temporary closures to see how things develop, and disputes among the people are occurring frequently. There is widespread lack of money, inability to cover expenses, and a shortage of living expenses. The general public is also expressing great dissatisfaction with the registration requirement of paying one-tenth and the brevity of the registration period. Various trade associations held a meeting to discuss this issue, and as a result, decided to submit the following opinions to the authorities immediately: (1) For funds deposited by local banks with the Central Bank before August 1st, whether they were Red Army currency or circulating currency, they should be exchanged for circulating currency at face value. (2) Because only one-tenth of the face value of Red Army currency is exchanged at the time of registration, with the remaining nine-tenths being deposited and a deposit slip issued, it is hoped that holders of these deposit slips will be loaned at least five-tenths of the face value of their deposit slips in circulating currency, in order to facilitate market finance. (3) According to regulations, only 22 branches of the four national banks (Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural) and commercial banks (Yifa, Zhicheng, Commercial, Gongcheng, etc.) are designated for registration and redemption. Given that the registration period is only ten days, it seems too short. Therefore, it is hoped that the number of exchange locations will be increased and the redemption period extended. (4) For the 9.7 billion yuan of Red Army currency issued beyond that recognized by the Soviet Union, the government should bear the responsibility for the losses, so as not to plunge society into a state of unrest. (5) The government should consider Red Army currency currently held by handlers of relief funds and other public funds being raised, so as not to put the handlers in a difficult situation. (6) Government agencies should accept Red Army currency for at least one-half of the amount of taxes levied. It is rumored that the authorities are currently studying this. Personnel handling registration at various banks are recalling the losses suffered by people during the early Republic of China due to Russian foreign currency and are already trembling with fear. This time, the losses to the people due to the Red Army currency are even more severe. Everyone is now regarding the currency of the puppet Manchuria as a treasure again, but on the other hand, they know that they will still suffer some losses. According to our reporter's investigation, the total amount of puppet Manchuria currency issued was 13.1 billion. Some estimate that about 100 million or more has been destroyed. In addition, the legal tender with Director Du's seal, which was temporarily circulated in the Northeast last winter, has already recovered 700 million. The remaining amount is less than 100 million and can be recovered by the end of the year. At the time of issuing this stamped legal tender, the exchange rate with the puppet Han currency was one-to-one.</p>
<h3>Five Customs Offices Temporarily Established in the Northeastern Region</h3>

Chairman Shen explained the situation in person. Mr. Chu stated that he understood the government's need to collect actual taxes, but pointed out that Jiangsu had discounted the tax amount by 20%, and the Ministry of Food had understood. Since Jiangsu and Zhejiang are adjacent, he requested that the same procedure be followed. The provincial government is currently inquiring with the Ministry of Food to verify the truth before deciding on a method. Chairman Shen has also telegraphed Chairman Chiang for instructions. The collection of land taxes in Zhejiang Province this year was originally scheduled to begin on September 1st in eastern Zhejiang and September 16th in western Zhejiang.

<h3>"Iron Bars Beauty" Kawashima Yoshiko; Claims to Have Never Even Had an Unofficial Marriage; Lives Alone in a Room, Passing the Years Reading "Dream of the Red Chamber"</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] "Iron Bars Beauty" Kawashima Yoshiko, who is thirty-two years old this year, told visitors that she is not yet married and has never even had an unofficial marriage. The rumor that she married a Mongolian prince and then ran away is the flattery of her older sister, Tushiye Tu. Okanshiye Tu died of illness not long after divorcing the Mongolian prince. She also denies the story that she dressed as a man and led 28 cavalrymen to occupy Chengde. She said that she was only fourteen years old at the time, how could she have had the courage to do that? That matter was done by her brother, Jin Bihui. She explained the reason why outsiders called her "Commander Jin": her father had participated in Zhang Xun's restoration, and at that time she was only four years old and liked to dress as a man, so the servants called her "Commander Jin," which later became her nickname. As for why she is named Kawashima Yoshiko, it is because she was raised in the Kawashima family in Japan and received education in a certain noble school in Japan, so she was named so. Her Chinese name is Jin Bihui. She currently lives alone in a room in prison, spending her days reading "Dream of the Red Chamber," sometimes teaching a boy named Teng to sing, trying to pass the time.</p>

<h3>Japanese Reparations and the Restoration of Municipal Administration</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, U.S. reparations commissioner Edwin W. Pauley has visited and investigated the material conditions in Japan, Korea, and our Northeast. He has since reported and made recommendations to U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes. At the same time, it is rumored that the U.S. has also suggested to the Far Eastern Commission that it re-draft the Japanese reparations plan. We believe that, regardless, the results of Pauley's investigation will contribute significantly to the future discussions on the amount of Japanese reparations and its distribution, and may serve as an important basis for implementation.</p>
<p>China was the first country to be invaded by Japan and suffered the greatest sacrifices. Therefore, the amount of compensation we demand from Japan should naturally be the largest. According to Pauley's remarks in Tokyo, the Allied nations' purpose in dealing with the reparations issue is twofold: first, to dismantle Japan's military-industrial complex to ensure lasting peace; and second, to transfer Japan's military-industrial facilities to the invaded countries to develop their industries. This embodies the intention to eliminate aggression and lay the foundation for peace while compensating the invaded countries for their losses. We deeply agree with this far-sightedness. Having learned from Japan's long-term aggression, we know that Japan dared to brazenly launch a war of aggression because of China's industrial backwardness and weak national defense, which aroused Japan's covetousness. To ensure peace in the Pacific in the future, China's prosperity and strength must be the main stabilizing force. Many people in the country advocate using Japanese reparations to establish heavy industry, consolidate national defense, promote national economic prosperity, and guarantee the victory of world peace. This opinion is in line with the two goals expressed by Pauley.</p>
<p>However, we would like to point out that general attention is focused on national defense and heavy industry, and other aspects seem to be neglected. The restoration of municipal administration is one of these aspects. In our opinion, establishing heavy industry and consolidating national defense are the most fundamental requirements for China's revival. However, during the eight-year war of aggression, Japan spared no effort in destroying the municipal construction of our occupied major cities. Now that they have been recovered, it is difficult to restore them due to the lack of various facilities. This has a great impact on the future development of the national economy, and it is necessary to demand considerable materials from Japan for compensation. We believe that Japanese reparations should not be limited to military-industrial materials alone.</p>
<p>Recalling that since the July 7th Incident, each of Japan's attacks has targeted our country's major cities. Because cities are the center of the national economy, occupying a city allows for the control of the region related to that city; destroying a city also has a serious impact on the region related to that city. Taking Shanghai as an example, after Japan occupied Shanghai at that time, because of Shanghai's special importance in our country's economy, the severe damage it caused to our country's economy is self-evident. After other major cities were occupied, they also had a greater or lesser impact on our country's economy, depending on their importance. Fortunately, our government took appropriate measures and managed to overcome these difficulties. Now that the cities have been recovered, it stands to reason that the central role of the cities should also return to normal. However, if the destroyed municipal construction cannot be restored in time, its central role will be greatly weakened, and the damage to our country's economy will not be completely eliminated. The restoration of municipal construction is the key to the economic development and prosperity of cities; and the development and prosperity of urban economies can promote the development and prosperity of the national economy. The depth of this relationship and the magnitude of its impact cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>According to the original meaning of compensation, if Party A's materials are destroyed by Party B, Party B should compensate with the same materials. This original meaning should also apply to the issue of Japanese reparations. Although in order to eliminate aggression and permanently establish peace, we cannot but focus on dismantling Japan's military-industrial complex. However, if our original municipal facilities or materials have been damaged by Japan's aggression, affecting the development of the national economy, and these facilities or materials are also possessed by Japan, then demanding the same materials as compensation is also justified. Taking Shanghai as an example, after Shanghai was occupied by Japan for a long time, all of its original municipal construction was severely damaged, especially water, electricity, gas, trams, buses, docks, ferries, etc. These facilities were either destroyed, plundered, or allowed to deteriorate. The magnitude of the loss is difficult to estimate, and there are facts to prove it. This municipal construction is not only necessary for the daily life of the people, but also related to the development and prosperity of industry and commerce. If it is not vigorously restored, Shanghai's importance will be greatly reduced, and the national economy will also suffer greatly. However, the materials for restoring this construction are very scarce domestically, and it is extremely difficult to replenish them. Japan is still quite rich in this equipment. Investigating and seeking compensation from them to offset wartime losses is not an excessive request. After Shanghai receives this type of compensation, the four million citizens will benefit from it, and the activity of industry and commerce will double. This will be a great help in promoting national prosperity and becoming a stabilizing force for peace in the Pacific. Therefore, we do not hesitate to elaborate on the issue of demanding reparations from Japan, pointing out that attention should be paid to the restoration of municipal administration, precisely because we are aware of this.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Commission for Japan has passed an interim report on the issue of Japanese reparations, allowing each invaded country to submit a request for compensation. We hope that when the government submits this application, in addition to focusing on major aspects such as national defense and heavy industry, it will also pay attention to the acquisition of materials for municipal construction. At the same time, we hope that the Allied nations will also pay attention to this when discussing this issue. Because this is not only beneficial to China, but also beneficial to world peace.</p>
<h3>Derailment Case on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Last Month – Investigation Confirms Communist Conspiracy</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 3rd] The Suzhou Provincial authorities have discovered that the tragic derailment of the "Victory" express train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway between Zhoujing Lane and East Wuxi on July 10th was instigated by Xue Yonghui, the Taihu Garrison Director of the New Fourth Army, who instructed Zhou Zhimin, Director of the Yangshan Office, to take the opportunity to loosen the screws from the tracks. It is also rumored that there are continuing attempts to sabotage at any time. Relevant authorities here are planning a sound prevention plan.</p>

<h3>Voting System Issue at Peace Conference – Becomes Focus of Dispute Between Large and Small Nations – Four Powers Pass Resolution on Rotating Chairmanship</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] Yugoslavia has stated that it will demand the right to veto proposals at the Paris Conference regarding Trieste. This request involves both the issue of the Port of Trieste and the voting rights system. New Zealand, Brazil, and the Netherlands have also formally opposed the two-thirds majority voting system proposed by the Four Powers for the first time, and advocate for a simple majority system. Yugoslavia believes that any proposals regarding border issues cannot be effective without the consent of the Allied nations involved. The Soviet Union's attitude remains unclear today. However, Belarusian representative Kislov expressed support for the Four Powers' plan for the Port of Trieste, while stating that the final decision should be based on protecting Yugoslavia's national economic and special interests. Discussions in the Rules Committee remain stalled on the issue of the majority voting system. It is expected that if Britain and the United States firmly insist on a two-thirds majority, this method may become established. Otherwise, a simple majority system may be adopted, and the roots of the crisis will be buried therein.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 3rd] The Rules Committee of the Peace Conference today passed a resolution supporting the rotation of the chairmanship by the Four Powers by a vote of twelve to eight. The Abyssinian representative did not participate in the vote. U.S. representative Byrnes declared that he supports the rotation of the chairmanship of the Peace Conference by the Four Powers, as widening the rift over this issue would threaten not only the Peace Conference but also the subsequent Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. The adoption of the Four Power rotation chairmanship was influenced by Byrnes' remarks. According to the French alphabetical order, the first chairman will be the United States, followed by France, Britain, and the Soviet Union every three days. During the debate, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov repeatedly insisted that the chairman of the Peace Conference should be rotated by the Four Powers. The New Zealand representative, supported by the Netherlands, Brazil, Australia, and Canada, strongly opposed this proposal, stating that France is the host country and should be asked to serve as the permanent chairman to prevent disputes.</p>
<h3>Indian Representative Delivers Speech – Concerned About Peace in the Middle East – Greek Representative Makes Two Requests</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 3rd Broadcast: The sixth plenary session of the Peace Conference was held today at 3:00 PM (midnight in Shanghai). Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar, the chief Indian representative, delivered a speech, stating that India has close economic and cultural ties with East Africa geographically, and is closely linked to the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. Therefore, it is also concerned about the future of Italian territories. He concluded by saying that although there are many difficulties and intense contradictions in this Peace Conference, the Indian people still deeply believe that the Peace Conference can achieve success. Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaaris then spoke, stating that Greece has two requests: (1) to request material compensation to compensate for the losses suffered by Greece, otherwise Greece will be unable to rebuild itself; (2) to request a guarantee of its territorial security through collective cooperation. Finally, representatives from Ukraine, Belgium, and South Africa delivered speeches, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Soviet Foreign Minister Quietly Leaves When Canadian Prime Minister Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] A Canadian representative attending the Peace Conference recently said that when the Canadian Prime Minister rose to deliver a speech at the Peace Conference yesterday, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov quietly left, but this had no major political significance.</p>
<h3>Abyssinia Demands Italian East African Territories</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] Abyssinian representative Wolde, in a speech at the Peace Conference today, requested that the Italian East African territories of Eritrea and Somaliland be incorporated into its territory. It is claimed that these colonies were invaded and exploited by Italy. This is the first country to make a request for Italian territories at the Peace Conference. Abyssinia also hopes to obtain reparations from Italy. Wolde ignored the fact that the Four Powers' conference had agreed to postpone the issue of Italian colonies for a year, and unexpectedly made a request, which was unexpected.</p>
<h3>Spanish Government in Exile Active in Paris</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 3rd Broadcast: The Spanish Republican government in exile has begun informal talks with Italian and Soviet representatives at the Paris Peace Conference regarding the recognition of the Republican government as the legitimate government of Spain. Most of the 21 countries attending the Peace Conference have not yet recognized the Spanish Republican government, so the Spanish Republicans intend to use the opportunity of the Peace Conference to negotiate this matter. Molotov said in a speech on Wednesday that the time for removing the Franco regime is not far off, which has given the Republicans a lot of encouragement. They interpreted this as saying that the Soviet Union will announce a definite plan to expel Franco at the Paris Peace Conference or at the United Nations General Assembly to be held in September.</p>
<h3>New Belgian Cabinet Formed – Huysmans Appointed Prime Minister</h3>

<h3>British Government Reiterates Policy – Maintain Austrian Integrity</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd] Minister of State Philip Noel-Baker recently declared in the House of Commons that the British government attaches great importance to any action that would divide Austria, and even more so to actions that would undermine Austria's integrity in internal affairs and foreign policy, because maintaining Austria's integrity has been agreed upon by the Four Powers. The British government, in accordance with the declaration issued by the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference, will do its utmost to seek an agreement with Austria to bring the occupation to an end.</p>

<h3>Britain Dispatches Indian Troops to Basra – Britain Plans to Establish Largest Military Base in Pakistan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] An official announcement states: The authorities have dispatched troops from India to Basra (a major port in the Persian Gulf, belonging to Iraq) to protect the lives of British, Indian, and Arab people and British interests in southern Iran if necessary.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The India Office stated: The New Delhi radio station announced that Indian troops have been transferred from India to Basra to protect the lives of British, Indian, and Arab people and British interests in southern Iran. In fact, there is no issue of British troops being transferred to Iran. The Ministry originally hoped to clarify this intention when announcing the troop movements.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] A "New York Times" reporter stated: The so-called withdrawal from Egypt is not only the withdrawal of the British Army from Egypt, but also the abandonment of the naval base in Alexandria and the air base in the desert. Palestine can be used as a new base for the army, navy, and air force. The partition plan for Palestine is under consideration.</p>
<p>The Negev Region is of Strategic Importance</p>
<p>The plan aims to keep the Negev desert region in southern Pakistan under British control. It is rumored that Britain intends to establish its largest military base in the Middle East here. Britain had previously obtained the right to station troops in Transjordan when it allowed it to become independent. British military leaders hope that after establishing a military base in the Negev, British troops can still be readily deployed in the event that the Suez Canal is attacked. British aircraft can reach the canal area in one hour, Cairo in two hours, and Baghdad in less than three hours from the Negev. The port of Haifa can be developed into a first-class naval port, and the oil fields are nearby, so the Negev is the most ideal military base in the Middle East. Although the Iraqis want to revise the British-Iraqi treaty, it is expected that the British army will not lose its position in that country after the new treaty is concluded. Therefore, although the British army has withdrawn from Syria and Lebanon, the troops in Iraq are still a strong force to protect the oil fields and the canal.</p>
<p>Cyprus is a Strategically Important Military Prize</p>
<p>In addition to Pakistan, Iraq, and Transjordan, Cyprus is also an important base for Britain's plan to control the Mediterranean. There is a good natural naval port on the east coast of the island, and the eastern part of the island is a plain, which can be used for aircraft to take off and land. Geographically, the island controls the entrance to the Aegean Sea, which is equivalent to the gateway to the Black Sea. From Kyrenia on the north coast of Cyprus to Turkey is only 45 miles, from Larnaca on the southeast coast of the island to Beirut is only 20 miles, and from the south coast to the Suez Canal is also 230 miles. Historically, Cyprus has been the battlefield for Arabs, Romans, French, Venetians, Turks, and British. The evolution of modern tactics does not reduce the military importance of Cyprus. Britain's suspicion of Moscow's interference is also due to this.</p>
<h3>Silent Rocket Passes Over Sweden</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Swedish Capital, 2nd] It is reported that someone witnessed a silver silent rocket slowly passing over the forests of northern Sweden. Seven or eight people witnessed this object, all saying that it was shaped like an airplane. This type of rocket has been found over Sweden several times recently, and there is much speculation as to whether it came from the Soviet-occupied zone. Military authorities have prohibited the publication of the locations where the rockets passed in order to prevent the launchers from measuring their direction and speed.</p>
<h3>Truman Disagrees with Pakistan Partition Plan – U.S. Delegation Recalled Home – Hopes for Roundtable Conference Dim</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] Well-informed sources say the U.S. President is unlikely to endorse a plan to divide Palestine into two provinces and two districts, although official statements are still lacking. Attlee's actions will depend on the official statement. It is heard that the British Cabinet is scheduled to hold a special meeting next Wednesday to discuss the Palestine issue, at which time President Truman's attitude towards the Palestine partition plan may be clearly announced. Churchill previously suggested transferring the trusteeship of Palestine to the United Nations organization, and many Labor Party members also support this proposal. The Cabinet meeting next Wednesday will pay special attention to this matter.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] The U.S. delegation in London discussing the Palestine issue suddenly returned home yesterday after receiving an urgent telegram from the President. The reason may be that the British Cabinet must obtain Truman's decision on the Palestine partition plan before discussing the Palestine issue on Wednesday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] Authoritative sources: Among the Arab countries that have accepted the British government's invitation to attend a meeting to discuss the Palestine issue, there are four countries: Transjordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Lebanon. However, they are all conditional, that is, they are unwilling to meet at the same table with Jewish representatives. Therefore, the hope of holding a roundtable conference seems to be quite slim. It is expected that the British government may adopt a method of exchanging views individually.</p>
<h3>British and American Parliaments Adjourn</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 3rd] The British Parliament declared adjournment today and will reconvene on October 8th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd, Associated Press] The 79th U.S. Congress declared its longest recess in seven years. In its final hasty action, the Senate passed a resolution authorizing the government to submit U.S. diplomatic disputes to the jurisdiction of the World Court.</p>
<h3>Truman Signs Congressional Reorganization Act</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 2nd] President Truman today signed the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. This bill was originally proposed by Senator La Follette and Representative Monroney. The President called it "one of the most important advances since the establishment of the U.S. Congress." The main features of the reorganization are as follows: the annual salary of members of Congress is increased from $10,000 to $12,500, plus an additional allowance of $25,000. Among the 23 committees in the Senate, 18 are abolished, and among the 48 committees in the House, 29 are abolished. At the beginning of each Congress, four major committees hold meetings to submit the federal budget for the following year. People who lobby members of Congress must register their names, employers, and expenses. It is stipulated that the period of annual adjournment of Congress shall be at least from August 1st to January 1st. Members of Congress who have served for six years and are 62 years of age may join the federal government's retirement plan if they have contributed to the retirement fund. The formulation of this bill is the first time since 1921 that Congress has agreed to reform its procedures and organization.</p>
<h3>Nuremberg Trial – Verdict Expected Early Next Month</h3>
<p>Germany Planned to Eradicate Half-Jews</p>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 2nd] The Nuremberg International Tribunal today, citing captured German documents, announced for the first time that Germany attempted to eliminate the reproductive capabilities of all half-Jews within the country or to exile them. The plan was drafted by the former Minister of Justice, Schlegelberger, one of the defendants. The defendant testified in court that the plan was approved by Hitler, but its implementation was to be delayed until after Germany won the war. The document also implicated another defendant, former Minister of the Interior, Frick. Prosecutors stated today that the trial of Germany’s twenty-one war criminals could end on the 15th of this month, with a verdict delivered on September 2nd. At the same time, the German secret police's investigation procedures are still underway.</p>
<h3>Northeast Aggression Case</h3>
<p>International Tribunal Concludes Hearing</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] The International Military Tribunal concluded its hearing on the Japanese aggression against Northeast China this afternoon, preparing to present evidence of the invasion of China when the court reconvenes on the 5th. The evidence of Japan's invasion of China is limited to the Northeast region, so that Chinese witnesses who urgently need to return home can do so sooner. The showing of the twelfth reel of the film titled "Japan's Critical Period" will be postponed and screened in court on the morning of the 5th. The film is considered a valuable historical record showing how Japan educated its people.</p>
<h3>Burmese Puppet Prime Minister Ba Maw Acquitted</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rangoon, 3rd] Former Burmese puppet government Prime Minister Ba Maw was released yesterday by order of the British government. Ba Maw served the enemy during the fall of Burma and declared war on Britain and the United States. When British forces reoccupied Burma, Ba Maw fled to Japan, hiding in a temple. He was captured by the Allied forces, imprisoned in Sugamo Prison, and transferred here yesterday. Authorities announced that Ba Maw bears no personal responsibility for atrocities, and the British have no intention of prosecuting him for treason. Therefore, Ba Maw can resume his political activities after being acquitted.</p>
<h3>Britain Convenes Air Force Conference – Chiefs of Staff from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand Invited to Discuss the Formation of an Imperial Air Force</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd] Air Marshal Tedder has convened air force commanders from various regions to hold a conference in London to discuss air force reorganization. The conference will last for three days starting on the 7th of this month. Chiefs of Staff from the air forces of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have also been invited to participate.</p>
<h3>World Can Only Achieve Security by Not Resolving Disputes with Force – U.S. Releases Second Atomic Bomb Test Report</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] The White House today released two reports received by President Truman concerning the second underwater atomic bomb explosion at Bikini Atoll on July 25th. One report warned that the Bikini test showed that "the world must abolish war as a method of resolving international disputes if it wishes to achieve security." This report came from the President's Evaluation Commission, composed of nine non-military personnel, including Dr. Compton, the current president of MIT and an atomic energy scientist, and chaired by Senator Hatch of New Mexico. The second report came from the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Atomic Bomb Test Evaluation Committee, composed of naval and army officers and non-military scientists, chaired by Compton. Both reports pointed out that the radiation energy immediately after the underwater explosion was "estimated to be equivalent to hundreds of tons of atomic energy." The observation ship "Haven," where the two evaluation groups were stationed, was located eleven miles from the explosion site. The report described the major damage caused by the bomb as follows: The battleship "Arkansas" sank immediately, the aircraft carrier "Saratoga" sank within seven and a half hours after the explosion, and the destroyer "Hughes" ran aground on the sand but avoided sinking. The Japanese battleship "Nagato" sank five days after the explosion. The President's Evaluation Commission report compared air and underwater explosions, reaching the following conclusion: "Based on our observations, surface ships in the damage zone suffered more severe damage from the air explosion than from the underwater explosion. The flood caused by the second bomb contained deadly radiation. An enemy with two or more atomic bombs could cause damage equivalent to the combined damage of the two tests. The results of the two tests are being studied by the Maritime Bureau, and it is expected that the size, style, and structure of future ships will be completely changed to reduce the impact of explosions. We believe distance is the best defense. The Bikini test clearly shows that future atomic bomb wars will destroy nations and change the current level of civilization. The world must not use war as a tool for resolving international disputes if it wishes to be safe; this is self-evident." The Joint Chiefs of Staff Evaluation Committee's report detailed the atomic bomb explosion process, stating: "The water column stirred up by the atomic bomb was 2,200 feet in diameter and 5,500 feet high. The water column contained approximately 10 million tons of seawater. The waves outside the water column (approximately 1,000 feet from the point of impact) were 80 to 100 feet high. As the waves surged outward, the wave crests quickly decreased. The work of measuring the seabed wave vibrations has not yet been completed. There was no earthquake phenomenon during the atomic bomb explosion." Regarding the strong radiation produced by the explosion, it stated: "Human heads exposed to this strong radiation for a few minutes would be instantly paralyzed and would die within a few days or weeks. This highly damaging radioactive seawater made it difficult to ensure the safety of inspection teams entering the target area four days later. Details of the damage remain to be determined after a thorough investigation by the engineering team. In both tests, the arrangement of the target ships did not represent normal fleet mooring patterns. The arrangement of the target ships was purely to obtain the maximum results caused by the atomic bomb explosion." The observation and conclusion section of the committee report stated: "It is indeed possible to estimate the atomic bomb explosion within the scope of a normal explosion. In the first atomic bomb air burst, the above-deck equipment on major ships within a half mile suffered heavy damage, while the internal structure had only minor damage. In both tests, almost all ships within one mile were damaged. The second atomic bomb threw a large amount of radioactive seawater, which entered the hulls and decks, and the ships often became radiation warehouses, and the radiation could burn to death any living things on board. It seems premature to analyze the Bikini test and its problems in detail. We should point out that we should actively and immediately study certain unique problems caused by atomic bombs. The problem of atomic bombs poisoning large amounts of seawater is one of them. We should not only study the problem of protecting sailors on board, but also the problem of protecting people from radiation damage." The Evaluation Committee's report included a supplementary report on the first test, stating, "Approximately twenty ships within a half mile of the impact zone suffered heavy damage. The ships that did not sink should undergo twelve days of preliminary repairs, otherwise, the ships will not be able to return to the main base on their own for complete repair."</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Government in Korea Should Continue to Exist</h3>
<p>Opinions Expressed in MacArthur's Letter</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] MacArthur stated in a summary letter to the Korean military government today that due to the breakdown of negotiations between the U.S.-Soviet Commission, the U.S. military government in Korea still needs to continue to exist. After the breakdown of negotiations between the U.S.-Soviet Commission, people publicly discussed whether to independently organize a temporary government in South Korea, but as the situation developed, the discussion subsided, and conversely, everyone hoped that the U.S. military government would continue to exist.</p>
<h3>Indonesian Radicals' Landing Attempt on Bali Thwarted</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 2nd] Dutch sources: Approximately 150 Indonesian radicals attempted to land on the coast of Bali east of Java at night, but were repelled by Dutch patrols. Many Indonesians were arrested, and a large number of firearms were seized.</p>
<h3>Belarus is a Wasteland</h3>
<p>UNRRA Releases Report</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 2nd] UNRRA recently released a report on the working conditions in Ukraine and Belarus, stating that there are no complete cities in the 400-mile stretch from Moscow to Minsk, resembling a desert. All ten million residents of Belarus are destitute, and only some livestock remain, hidden in dense forests and swamps. The situation in Ukraine is also tragic, with most towns relying solely on UNRRA relief supplies for survival. The average consumption of meat and fat is no more than one pound per person per month. UNRRA began transporting supplies to Ukraine and Belarus in March of this year, originally scheduled to deliver 2.5 million tons of materials, of which food and soap accounted for approximately 300,000 tons, and the rest were machinery and other items.</p>
<h3>Chinese Wives Allowed to Enter the U.S.</h3>
<p>Senate Passes Bill Yesterday</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The Senate passed a law today allowing Chinese wives of American citizens to enter the country and has sent the bill to the White House for approval.</p>
<h3>Remains of Chinese in Britain to be Returned for Burial</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd] The remains of Chinese people who died in the UK during the war have been temporarily placed in a Liverpool cemetery, waiting to be transported back to their homeland for burial. Chinese people do not wish to be buried in foreign lands, and the families of the deceased are willing to pay a high price to embalm the remains with incense for repatriation. Yesterday, the Mendes District Court handled a case of a Chinese woman who committed suicide by jumping off a building. According to her suicide note, she also requested her husband to transport her remains back to her hometown for burial.</p>
<h3>Miss Britain's Bad Habit – Licking Fingers After Eating Chocolate – Witty Answer to Parliamentarian's Question</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] Miss Summerskill, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food, is a red-haired and beautiful lady, but she has a bad habit, which is that she always licks her fingers after eating chocolate. Today in Parliament, a member raised the issue of "bad table manners" and asked Miss Summerskill to respond. The lady calmly stood up and said, "I admit that I do have this habit, but I don't believe that other members of parliament don't lick their fingers after eating chocolate, especially when it is a rare treat at the moment."</p>

<h3>Celebrating American Independence Day in President Truman's Hometown (Below) – Listening to Old Overseas Chinese Talk About the Past and Present</h3>
<p>— (Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing stationed in the United States)</p>
<p>On Independence Day, Mr. Menggen, the "mayor" of Grandview, is still working hard. Menggen is a car repairman, also a manor owner, a shop owner, and a bank manager. He is the richest person in the whole village, so he was elected as the mayor, serving as the "parent official" of the president's hometown. Menggen is a very hardworking and amiable person. He wore work clothes and greeted us at the car repair shop, reaching out his hands covered in grease, and sincerely welcoming us to visit the former residence of the current head of state. There are many Jews in Grandview, and there are also many Americans who migrated from Germany in the past.</p>
<p>President Truman's father was a German immigrant, and his mother was a British immigrant. These people of different races have lived together in the village for decades. Over time, they have become harmonious, like family members. After Truman became the President of the United States, some merchants in the village wanted to build some presidential memorial sites to attract tourists from all over the United States, but Truman stopped them all. According to people in the village, Truman himself hates these uncoordinated compliments and extravagance and does not want others to treat him as a "trick" to make money. I searched the whole village, and only one car repair station on a corner, a newly built house, was written "Truman Intersection". The old overseas Chinese He Liyuan has a very good "relationship" in this area. He walked in the middle of the village, greeting people left and right non-stop. His humility and simplicity are the typical Chinese people in the eyes of Americans. He must ask people "Is your wife safe?" "Is the baby doing well?" American friends have a good impression of him from the bottom of their hearts. I saw the Mayor Menggen of that small town hold his greasy hand and talk to him for a long time. He Liyuan used to live in this village, twenty-five years ago, he and the current head of state, had a life of "working at sunrise, resting at sunset, and hearing the sounds of chickens and dogs." They lived in the same village, as neighbors for six years.</p>
<p>Old He told me that before the war, five dollars could hire a servant to work for a week. After the war, labor was much more expensive, and six dollars could only hire a servant to work for a day, and the working hours of a day were less than eight hours. Every week pays seven days of wages, but only works five days, with two days off, but wages must be paid. Old He believes that this is a very uneconomical thing, so he decided to sell the land last year and got a price of fifteen thousand dollars. Old He's current life is worthy of praise. Five years ago, his old partner passed away, his son is in Indiana, and he lives alone at 129 East Linwood Street in Kansas City. He practices Chinese medicine and sells Chinese medicine, and many foreigners come and go from his clinic. He said that he has been tired of his profession for more than 30 years. But there are still many Americans who often come to seek medical treatment. He has a beautiful car that he drives himself, three hunting guns, and two fishing rods. He leads a very flavorful "fishing and hunting life" in his spare time, often fishing alone all day, and returning home in the evening with three bass, cooking and eating himself. Hunting in the suburbs of Kansas City is limited, only open for forty-five days between November and December each year. But fishing is free, as long as you get a "fishing license", you can fish anywhere.</p>
<p>Outside Kansas City, there are seventy-five lakes of various sizes. The municipal government specially raises fish species and feeds them fish food for many anglers, and welcomes citizens to go fishing and relaxing when they have nothing to do. He goes to bed early and gets up early every day, very concerned about his motherland. He has American citizenship, but he voluntarily gave it up. He said: "I am Chinese and will never change in my life." He hates the bad entertainment of overseas Chinese youths and often encourages young people to make progress. He doesn't like noisy cities, and his car mostly drives in the suburbs. One night before Consul Shen Zhuogan and I left Kansas City, he used his car to take us to a secluded restaurant called "Sandee" for dinner. The cool summer breeze blew in the suburbs of Kansas City, blowing on Old He's free and easy white hair. In the hazy night, I looked at his strong black shadow and deeply blessed him!

<h3>President Song Preserves Shipping Rights – Shipping Industry Extremely Excited</h3>
<p>Maritime Customs Bulletin No. 39 Resolved to be Abolished</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, President Song of the Executive Yuan has decided to cancel the Jianghai Customs Bulletin No. 39 of March 21 this year, which specifically approved foreign ships to navigate between coastal ports. The reason for the cancellation of this order is due to the impact of the flow that has occurred in recent months, and the shipping industry has repeatedly reported the facts to the authorities. President Song adopted the situation and quickly abolished it. In addition, the decision was made to preserve the navigation rights of the Yangtze River, and the original proposal to open trade to four ports was abolished. Only foreign ships transporting public goods and relief supplies are allowed to directly unload goods in Jinghan from abroad, and are not allowed to carry commercial goods. This issue has been specifically resolved. The shipping industry is extremely excited about President Song's cancellation of Jianghai Customs Bulletin No. 39, and the announcement on the 16th of last month that the rental of British ships would be terminated to ensure shipping rights. At the same time, compensation will be allowed to various private companies for the sinking of most commercial ships caused by participating in the Jianghai blockade work during the war, and to assist shipping companies in obtaining a large number of ships, totaling approximately 400,000 to 500,000 tons, in order to seek the restoration of China's shipping industry and gradually replace Japan's pre-war shipping position in the Far East.</p>

<h3>Pan Gongzhan's Address at Academic Symposium: International News Cooperation is the First Thing to Do in Cultural Cooperation; Chinese and British Journalists Have an Unshirkable Responsibility</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai cultural and academic circles' weekend academic symposium held its seventh symposium yesterday afternoon at the Shanghai branch of the World Cultural Cooperation Association on Avenue Joffre. More than 20 leading figures from the city's education, academic, news, industry, and science circles attended, as well as Mr. MacDonald, director of the British Information Office, and Mr. Holyoake of the British Consulate, to exchange views on Sino-British cultural cooperation. The symposium was chaired by Li Shizeng, a senior member of the Kuomintang, and began at 5:30 p.m. The discussion was very lively. Everyone present then requested Mr. Li to address the meeting. Mr. Li briefly stated: "The Sino-British cultural cooperation that has a history is not artificially created, but is the natural evolution of many years of culture." Mr. Li welcomed the two foreign guests and asked them for "advice." Mr. MacDonald, director of the British Information Office, and Mr. Holyoake of the British Consulate then delivered short speeches, both expressing their sincere gratitude for the cooperation of the Chinese people. Mr. Holyoake also pointed out that Mr. Li had transported a large number of scientific instruments and books to our cultural institutions and universities during the war through the dangerous Hump route, and is still continuing to do so. Then Mr. Pan Gongzhan addressed the meeting, saying: "The first thing to do in international cultural cooperation is international news cooperation. To achieve lasting world peace, it is necessary to deeply understand each other and seek to eliminate barriers. In this great war, China and Britain have been the two countries that have fought for the longest time, made the greatest sacrifices, and taken the greatest risks. After this history of shared adversity, coupled with the arrival of Ambassador Stevenson in China, the relations between the two countries will become closer. However, if we want to achieve thorough understanding between the two countries, the news circles of both countries have a great responsibility. Some past international misunderstandings and distorted and inaccurate reports should be held accountable. Therefore, how journalists cooperate in the future and how to increase mutual understanding between countries should be an urgent matter." Mr. Pan also pointed out that when Allied personnel collect news materials and political opinions from all walks of life, they should consider whether the news is accurate and whether the opinions can represent the majority of the Chinese people. Mr. Pan added: "British friends should especially understand that China is still in a transitional period and has not yet reached the democratic politics that Britain has in its history. We are learning, sincerely and earnestly learning. Unfortunately, after the war, various ideas have emerged at once. When British journalists report on the situation in China to their government and people, they hope to recognize the source of information and respect the opinions of the majority of the people in order to avoid increasing political friction in China." Mr. MacDonald immediately expressed his deep agreement. Subsequently, Mr. Li Shizeng accompanied them to visit the Shanghai branch of the World Society and the Biological Research Institute before the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Report on Rong Case Cracking by Garrison Headquarters; "Mental Torture" Method Used During Interrogation of Main Culprit Luo Wenqing</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The entire process of investigation and cracking of the Rong Desheng kidnapping case has been personally written into a report by Mr. Tao Yishan, director of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters. The internal staff of the department were mobilized and worked for three days and nights to complete the compilation. After it was submitted to Commander Xuan for review, it was publicly released to the press yesterday afternoon. Mr. Tao, carrying a thick investigative report of more than an inch, entered the reception room where reporters were gathered with a smile. He first gave a general explanation of the cracking process of the case, saying that the rapid cracking of the case was due to the active effort to take the lead and the close cooperation between the military and police agencies. During the process, the principles of impartiality and confidentiality were strictly observed, and no torture was used on the arrested criminals. Mr. Tao cited an example: the habitual bandit Luo Wenqing was interrogated 15 times, but there was no truthful confession. Finally, the "mental torture" method was used. Fifteen people were assigned to continuously interrogate him for 48 hours, which eventually made Luo confess everything. It can also be said that Luo's kidnapping of Rong made it a reality. According to Luo, he had committed more than 20 crimes before and was known as "Uncle Ye." The other accomplices in this case were initially wary, but were persuaded by Yuan Zhongshu, who said: "If you work with Uncle Luo, you will never fail." The criminals then boldly colluded and took action. Currently, 15 major criminals in the case have been transferred to the military court to begin trial. Yuan Zhengfei, Zhong Boyuan, Xiong Yonghe, and Pan Jinlong have also been temporarily transferred to the military court, but it is learned that they are not significantly related to this case. The details of the case are recorded below:</p>
<p>Kidnapping Process</p>
<p>At about 8 a.m. on May 25, Luo Wenqing, Zhang Shaoqing, Huang Ahu, and others took a car No. 15044 borrowed by Wu Zhigang at the intersection of Huacheng Road and Minguo Road (Wu's car was borrowed from Wang Gongxia, the deputy director of the headquarters adjutant's office), driven by Wu's driver Zhu Liansheng, and drove to the intersection of Ga'en Road and Meinini Road to park. Luo and others got out of the car and waited. When Rong's car drove out, Zhang Shaoxiang stepped forward to stop it, forbidding any noise. Huang Ahu showed a forged red arrest warrant, falsely claiming that a certain agency wanted to invite him for a talk. Luo Wenqing got into the car, took Rong down, forcibly dragged him into car No. 15044, and passed Beichang Road, turning through the Van Hoàng Ferry Station, Zhongshan Road, to the intersection near the Water and Electricity Company on Zhabei Water and Electricity Road to park. Huang A was waiting there. Luo and others took the hostage off the car. Luo Wenqing, Zhang Shaoqing, and Huang Aba carried Rong to Xiaobangbian, and carried him on a prepared civilian boat. Luo and Zhang Shaoqing immediately took a rickshaw back. Huang Aba was responsible for the hostage. The car was driven back by Song Liansheng. Liu and Huang took rickshaws along small roads back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Hostage Location</p>
<p>The hostage Rong was held by Luo Wenqing, Zhang Shaoqing, Huang Abao and others in a civilian boat hired in advance by a Xiaobangbian, the owner of the boat Xi Achuan, the ticket keeper is A Mao, (feared to be fabricated by Luo Wenqing, this name is being strictly pursued) Luo Weiquan, Huang Abao and Huang's concubine Zhang Wuyue, at six or seven o'clock the next afternoon, Luo Wenqing took Wu Zhigang's car, still driven by Zhu Liansheng, got off at the Mei Village of Route Dufour, waited until eight or nine o'clock, and drove to the Water and Electricity Company on Zhongshan Road, and put a person in blue cloth and an old fat man (Rong) into the car, stopped at the bridge in Caojiadu, Luo and others changed the hostage to a rickshaw and moved him to Huang Abao's house at No. 100, Old Public Benefit Lane, Caojiadu, Yuan then took the car to the Great World.</p>
<p>Contact Situation</p>
<p>1. Telephone: Luo Wenqing invited Zheng Liantang to contact Wu Kunsheng, the manager of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, by telephone to negotiate the ransom. Later, Wu discovered that the telephone was being monitored and warned him to stop the contact. Zheng then found the telephone number of Chen Pinsan, the deputy manager of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, in the telephone directory, and called Chen to continue the negotiation. Zheng made more than ten telephone calls before and after. 2. Letters: The bandits forced the hostage to write two handwritten letters to his family. The method of delivery was that Luo Wenqing hid the letters under the washbasin in the public toilet of the Xiang Sheng Hotel, and then called Chen Pinsan to tell him to take them away. On May 15, the bandits believed that the victim's side had failed to resolve the matter quickly, so they wrote an anonymous threatening letter and sent it by post to Zhan Rongpei, doing their best to threaten him. 3. Posters: The bandits found it difficult to talk by telephone and it was inconvenient to talk too much, so they used red paper to summon the lease and posted it on the wall of Chengshun Pawnshop on the west side of Jing'an Temple on May 23. A small paper was hidden on the back of the poster, indicating the route for payment. On the 24th, it was posted on the wall of the Nanjing Grand Theater. The small paper on the back indicated that the contact would be made in Room 316 of the Shenzhou Hotel.</p>
<p>Before and After the Ransom</p>
<p>The bandits initially demanded US$1 million for the ransom, but eventually reduced it to US$500,000. Yuan Zhongshu invited Wu Zhigang and Zhan Rongpei, the manager of Shenxin No. 2 and No. 5 Factory, to handle the payment. Wu was a graduate of Fudan University and is currently the manager of China University Enterprise Company. He has a good relationship with Zhan. Zhan has a reputation and is a close friend of Rong's and has a good reputation, so Wu represented the bandits and Zhan represented Rong to negotiate the ransom payment procedures. After several negotiations, at 9 a.m. on May 27, in Room 8 of the Labor Hospital, Wu put the US$500,000 in gold hidden by the hostage Rong Desheng into a leather suitcase. After locking it, he went to his mother-in-law's house at No. 54 Kangle Village, Fuxu Road. After Wu received the suitcase, he secretly opened it and took out US$100,000, wrapped it in cloth, kept US$400,000 in the suitcase, relocked it, and sent the original suitcase to Yuan Zhongshu's place at Nanyang Bridge in a car. Yuan then took the suitcase to Chen Luo's (Luo Wenqing's sister) house at No. 548 Minguo Road. Luo Wenqing and Huang Abao were waiting there. After the ransom was paid, at about 10 p.m. on the same day, Luo Wenqing and Zhang Shaoqing still used Wu Zhigang's car and his driver Zhu Liansheng to send the hostage to the intersection of Fuchai Road and Tifei Road to get off. Luo Wenqing hired a tricycle to send him back to Rong's son-in-law Tang Nengyuan's house on Meinini Road. Therefore, Rong Desheng, who had been kidnapped for more than a month, was released after paying a price of 500,000 US dollars.</p>
<p>Distribution of Loot</p>
<p>(1) The prescribed distribution amount, a diary was found on Luo Wenqing, which contained the following distribution method of US$400,000 (the remaining US$100,000 was embezzled by Wu Zhigang) A. Kidnapping capital 5 million legal tender, B. Pre-kidnapping vow 10 million legal tender, C. The remaining is divided into 16 and a half shares, each share is 22,000 US dollars, (a) Yuan Zhongshu initiated one share and directed one share, totaling two shares, (b) Wu Zhigang borrowed the car and got one share, (c) Zhao Shaozong got half a share for communication, (a) Huang Shaobao got one and a half shares, (e) Xi Achuan got one share for guarding the sign and one share for renting the boat, totaling two shares, (f) Zheng Liantang got one share for answering the phone and one share for contact, totaling two shares, (g) Zhang Shaoqing got one share for helping, (h) Liu Ruibiao got one share for helping, (i) Huang Abao got one and a half shares, (j) Luo Wenqing initiated one share, capital one share, and kidnapping one share, totaling three shares. D. Actual distribution amount, according to the confessions of the criminals, the actual amount of loot distributed to each criminal is calculated as follows: (a) Luo Wenqing 76,000 US dollars, (b) Yuan Zhongshu 27,000 US dollars, (c) Zhu Chansheng 5,000 US dollars, (d) Wu Zhigang 130,000 US dollars, (e) Zhu Liansheng 7,000 US dollars, (f) Zheng Liantang 40,000 US dollars, (g) Huang Shaoyin 15,000 US dollars, (h) Zhao Shaozong 10,000 US dollars. It was found that the actual amount obtained by the above criminals was only 310,000 US dollars, which is a large difference from the actual amount. The difference was mostly embezzled by the main criminals in the case such as Luo Wenqing, Yuan Zhongshu and Huang Abao.</p>

<h3>Municipal Finance Falls Short; House Donation and Rent Will Increase Greatly</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is learned that the total amount of financial revenue in this city in July reached more than 4.9 billion yuan, which is the highest record since the municipal government took over last year. However, according to Director Gu, the expenditure in July was greater than before, reaching 8 billion yuan, so the revenue and expenditure could not be balanced for a while. Therefore, according to general observation, it is feared that the future will be even less optimistic since the entertainment tax was reduced to 40% this month. Therefore, it may still be restored to 50%. It is also learned that in order to subsidize revenue, the Housing Rent and Quality Management Committee has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to approve the increase of the house donation standard, which should be calculated by adding 1,000 times to the rent in 1937, for both residential and commercial houses. The house donation collection rate is 14% of the rent. As for the rent, it is said that it will also be approved to increase at the same time, with residential houses increasing 500 times the amount in 1937 and commercial houses increasing 1,000 times.</p>

It was resolved in principle to pass the service period limited to three days this year, and the amount of compensation will be determined by the municipal government. (2) In order to determine the municipal government. Due to insufficient funds for the epidemic prevention committee, please add 50% to the current house donation, which will be borne by the tenants, and the estimated revenue is more than 450 million yuan. Please vote on the case, which was resolved and passed, limited to one term in this summer. (3) The municipal government handed over a case on the 1946 real tax collection of field tax, and the Executive Yuan ordered a nuclear instruction to be submitted to the municipal conference for resolution, and it should be sent to the court for review, and the decision was made to transfer the special case to the official council for handling.</p>

<h3>Yu Hualong and Others Indicted; Fang Nianzu's Evidence is Insufficient</h3>

<h3>Liang Hongzhi Was Summoned Yesterday; Mistakenly Thought to Be Executed; Had a Hearty Meal and Dressed Up Before Departure; Face Turned Pale and Covered in Cold Sweat</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The arch-traitor Liang Hongzhi has been uneasy in prison ever since the High Court sentenced him to death. Yesterday, at a little after 10 o'clock, three court police officers suddenly arrived at the Zhongjian Prison carrying a summons to bring Liang in. Upon hearing this, Liang's face suddenly changed, and he said palely to the police officers: "Please wait a moment, let me eat my fill and dress properly before I go." After saying this, he turned around to eat and, after dressing properly, followed the astonished police officers out of the prison gate. However, the three medical examiners did not escort Liang to the execution ground but to the court, because the High Procuratorate's office was investigating a certain case that involved Liang, so he was specifically brought from prison for questioning.

<h3>A Pharmacy Apprentice Became Blinded by Greed; Used Bleach to Remove the Endorsement on a Check; Fraudulently Cashed a Huge Sum and Fled Far Away; Enjoyed a Carefree Life by Riding Horses at the Six Bridges and Three Temples; Was Eventually Apprehended in Shanghai After Purchasing a Fine Horse</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On the morning of the 26th of last month, at 11 o'clock, Xie Hanzhang (40 years old, from Ningbo), the manager of Tongfeng Pharmacy at No. 14 Hengyuan Lane, Tianjin Road, instructed the apprentice Li Yucheng (18 years old, from Ningbo) to deposit a cashier's check from the Asia Bank with a face value of 30 million yuan (check number 33124) into Huichang Qianzhuang. Unexpectedly, the apprentice became greedy and secretly bought bleach, first removing the endorsement, and then, together with his friend Zhang Qiyin (18 years old, from Sichuan, residing at No. 14, Lane 179, Tianjin Road), went to the Asia Bank to cash it. The bank clerk was momentarily negligent and did not distinguish between genuine and counterfeit, paying the full amount. After receiving the money, Li and Zhang took a pedicab to another friend, Qiu Minxing (18 years old, from Zhejiang, residing on North Xiangyang Road), to store it. They also arranged to go out for lunch together. After lunch, they took the money to buy two leather suitcases, over 20 taels of gold, a small gold ingot, and three gold rings. Returning to Qiu's place, they put 19,665,000 yuan into the suitcases, asking Zhang and Qiu to keep them safe, saying that he was going to Hangzhou to purchase medicinal materials and carrying so much money on the road was inconvenient, and he would need them to remit the money when he needed it in Hangzhou. Then, he hurriedly took his leave with the remaining amount of about 6 million yuan and the gold in another suitcase. By this time, it was nearly 5 p.m. Zhang and Qiu, because of their close friendship with him, insisted on seeing him off, so they hired a pedicab to escort him to the West Shanghai Station to board the train. When Zhang and Qiu returned home, the manager of Tongfeng, because Li Yucheng had been gone for a long time and had not returned, was deeply concerned about an accident, so he telegraphed Huichang Qianzhuang to inquire. The bank told him that no check had been deposited today, so he knew something was wrong. He hurried to Asia Bank to inquire and learned that someone had cashed it. He immediately pursued the guarantor Xu Wenxin and reported to the Huangpu Branch for investigation. At the same time, Qiu Minxing's parents also discovered the suitcase full of banknotes and knew there must be a reason, so they took their son to the Huangpu Branch to report and await investigation. Therefore, they coincided without prior arrangement, and the huge sum was first recovered. The Judicial Section Chief Zhou Guanghui then dispatched members Tie Jian and Zhao Haiming, and police chief Wang Shufan to Hangzhou to investigate. They learned that Li Yucheng had arrived in Hangzhou and was staying at No. 37 Hubin Hotel, enjoying a carefree life amidst the scenery of West Lake. Because he liked horse riding, he spent his days riding horses at the Six Bridges and Three Temples, and told the groom that he wanted to buy a fine horse for commuting to school in the future. The groom, Sun Xingguo, saw him.</p>
<p>His extravagant behavior made him think he was a wealthy young master from Shanghai, so he introduced the horse trader Wu Shixian to find one for him. Because there were no good breeds in Hangzhou, they agreed to come to Shanghai yesterday. After the police detectives learned of this, they once again tracked him to Shanghai and arrested the three men in room 311 of the Jinshan Hotel on Sanma Road at 4 p.m. yesterday, and seized more than 100,000 yuan and 7 taels of gold. According to Li's confession: there was still more than 1 million yuan and 11 taels of gold in Hangzhou, and the rest had been spent. The First Police Bureau immediately summoned Xie Zhang and guarantor Xu Wenxin to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Post-War Revised Edition of National Textbooks; Mass Supply Through Joint Printing and Sales; Ministry of Education Strictly Orders All Provinces and Cities to Prohibit Counterfeit Textbooks</h3>

<h3>The First School for the Blind in the United States (Continued from Yesterday); The Perkins School Founded in 1829</h3>
<p>In the kindergarten, there are all kinds of play equipment, slides, swings, and balls, which they can play with freely. If they fall, they pick themselves up, dust off the dust on their bodies, and continue playing. Because falling is a very common thing, and no child will cry.</p>
<p>The children live with the teachers and can get more contact. The curriculum is similar to that of ordinary schools. They rely on their fingers to feel raised letters. There is a weekly newspaper specifically for the blind published in Braille, and through this newspaper, they also know all the news in the world. They also have vocational courses, such as mat making, woodworking, weaving, mechanics, etc. They can also go to ordinary universities. Many Perkins graduates are now studying at Harvard, Boston University, and other universities.</p>
<p>In music, they are particularly accomplished. Every Perkins student must be able to play the piano. There are a total of 257 students in the school, ranging in age from five to nineteen, with a total of 71 pianos and all other instruments.</p>
<p>Not only blind children, but also deaf and blind students study there. They rely on the meaning of words and different vibrations to learn. At first, there was electrical equipment to help, but later, just by placing their fingers on the other person's face, they could know the meaning of everything. The phonetic method of learning is completely abandoned.</p>
<p>The students at Perkins School for the Blind come from the United States and 19 other countries, including China. Many graduates have returned home and have also opened schools of the same nature, and China now has one. (Translated from a US News Agency manuscript: The End)</p>
<p>Illustration: Extracurricular activities for blind children, two are "reading" newspapers, and three are knitting sweaters.</p>
<h3>Using Proceeds from the Sale of Surplus Materials; Exchange Students to Study Abroad; Truman Recently Approved the Fulbright Act; Enhancing International Understanding and Cultural Exchange</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] The United States recently established a long-term plan to enhance international understanding, as President Truman has approved a bill proposed by Senator Fulbright, authorizing the State Department to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of surplus materials overseas for student exchange and other educational activities. According to the provisions of this bill, up to $20 million can be provided to any country that provides US surplus materials for educational exchange work, and $1 million can be used annually in the aforementioned countries. The United States is currently conducting negotiations with several countries (including China) on this matter, but the amount spent can reach $3 million to $20 million. Fulbright stated that the main impact of the bill will be that in the next two or three decades, it will allow about 100,000 American students to study abroad. This bill uses the loan from the US for each country to purchase the value of surplus materials, so it cannot manage the expenses of international students from other countries. The bill also stipulates that the expenses for this activity must use foreign currency. Under these regulations, Chinese students can still receive scholarships at the various universities jointly run by American churches in China and at Yenching and Lingnan Universities. And students going to study in US universities can also get travel expenses from this bill.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Appoints Two Committee Members, Fang and Wu, to Supervise Sports in the Capital City - Propose Four Suggestions for Sports Facilities</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent] The Ministry of Education has appointed Fang Wanbang and Wu Bangwei, members of the National Sports Committee, to supervise the implementation of sports programs in the capital city. Fang and Wu visited the Nanjing Education Bureau on the first day, where they were received by Yang Rubiong, the head of the Third Section. Yang reported on the current state of sports facilities in Nanjing and the matters currently being planned. Fang and Wu proposed four key suggestions: (1) The City Education Bureau should quickly establish a National Sports Committee to strengthen the sports organizational structure in order to promote the development of sports in Nanjing. (2) The consultant appointed by the Ministry should be included in the current sports training program organized by the city in order to provide guidance and promotion. (3) The Bureau should investigate the state of sports facilities in schools throughout the city, compile statistics and reports in order to set work priorities for the next phase based on the actual situation. (4) Social sports should be actively developed. Department Head Yang, representing the Education Bureau, expressed his acceptance and compliance. He also requested that the Ministry of Education's sports supervisors maintain contact and assist with guidance at any time.</p>
<p>Briefing on Civil Affairs</p>
<h3>City Government Civil Affairs Office Convenes the Seventh District Administration Meeting Yesterday - Director Zhang Presides Over Discussion of Several Major Cases</h3>
<p>The City Government Civil Affairs Office convened the seventh district administration meeting yesterday (the 3rd) at 9:00 AM in the City Government Auditorium. District chiefs, and heads of various offices and sections, were present. Director Zhang Xiaosong presided over the meeting. The chairman first reported on a letter from the Ministry of Interior requesting the establishment of district mediation committees and the implementation of production initiatives. He added that the number of public office candidates in the city was too small. Each district should encourage citizens to participate in qualification reviews, with the hope of having thirty to forty people per district in the urban areas and twenty to thirty people per district in the rural areas. He also added that proposals for the district administration meeting should not be submitted one or two days before the meeting, but can be submitted at any time so that there is time to print, distribute, and study them. Next, the 20th District reported on local public health matters, and the 11th District reported that the issue of office space for the district government had not been resolved for a long time and that the police station was urging them to move. The district hoped to be allocated space. Among the cases discussed, the most important were the recommendation of personnel for the autonomous organization and the responsible officials, the arrangement for veterans to solicit donations with the help of security personnel, the requests from various agencies and armies for assistance from the district office, and the registration of household registrations entering and leaving.

<h3>Answer to the 24th District Office</h3>
<p>The Civil Affairs Office has responded to the 24th District Office saying that the Executive Yuan's strict prohibition of concurrent employment for civil servants refers to civil servants in Agency A concurrently employed by Agency B. Since the duties are different, their energy and time are not allowed. Even some civil servants try to take on concurrent employment in order to increase their income, which leads to poor performance of their duties, so it has been repeatedly prohibited. Concurrent employment may be permitted in order to promote operational coordination and improve work efficiency as long as it does not harm the original duties. For example, the Central Government has explicitly stipulated that village chiefs may serve concurrently as principals of national schools and captains of national guard teams, for the purposes of integrating care, relief, and health in villages, which is one example of this. As for the staff of the District People's Representative Council, Article 19 of the Implementing Rules of the City Organization Law stipulates that they should be appointed by the District Chief from among the staff of the District Office. Therefore, the City Government's decision not to establish full-time staff for the District People's Representative Council and to have staff from the District Office serve concurrently due to limited funding is not inconsistent with central regulations. Whether or not to employ District People's Representative Council staff should be determined after ensuring sufficient funding.</p>

<h3>High Discount Rates and Large Expenses - Silk Factories and Brokers Share the Same Difficulties - The Inability to Export is the Current Fatal Flaw</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In the midst of high-interest loans, silk reeling factories are uniquely able to obtain a loan of two million yuan from the Central Bank at a monthly interest rate of 1.8 percent to purchase silk cocoons. Furthermore, they are providing loans of one million yuan to silk reelers at the same interest rate. This is quite exceptional. However, according to surveys, of the hundred or so silk factories in three provinces and two cities, less than one-fifth have opened. In the city, which was once full of silk factories before the war, only Dali, Lianyuan, Daming, Hefeng, and four or five other factories remain open and are barely managing to operate. The situation is still extremely dire. According to industry insiders, although the government provides low-interest loans, the purchase price of silk cocoons is limited to 120,000 yuan per dan. Therefore, one dan of silk requires 2.4 million yuan for the silk cocoons alone. Adding in wages, factory fees, interest, etc., the cost exceeds one million yuan. As a result, the cost of silk is 3.4 million yuan per dan.</p>
<p>The Cost is Still Too Far From the Selling Price</p>
<p>The current market price in New York is 933 pounds of silk per pound for US dollars, equivalent to 1,200 US dollars per dan, or 2.4 million yuan. The shipping cost from the factory to the United States, the cost of labor, and insurance fees are not included. As such, exporting each dan of silk results in a loss of over 50 percent. Industry insiders dare not continue to do so. According to sources from the Silk Reeling Industry Association, the industry has enough spring cocoons to produce 20,000 dan of silk. However, because the cost is too high and exports are difficult, they must request export subsidies from the government in order to open factories. Moreover, authorities in the import and export industry said that silk is the focus of Chinese export goods. Before the war, exports could reach around 120,000 dan per year. Although various efforts have been made this year, only 8,000 to 9,000 dan have been obtained. They also say that the foreign trust in Chinese silk is still good.</p>
<p>The Chain System is Beneficial to Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Currently, various parties advocate for a chain system for imports and exports. If this can be achieved, the export bill of exchange for 120,000 dan of silk can obtain foreign exchange positions of tens of thousands of US dollars. The government should take a holistic approach and provide support. In the midst of the silk reeling industry’s decline, silk weaving factories and silk brokers are also suffering difficulties. According to sources from the Silk Weaving Factory Association, there are currently 5,600 weaving machines in the city. However, due to sluggish sales of silk fabrics, the labor-management friction has not recovered in recent months. Only a few factories are operating. Furthermore, according to sources from the silk and satin sales industry, sales are weak and capital is too heavy. Under high-interest exploitation, the industry will have no way to survive. Several businesses have already been stranded or suspended operations in recent days. However, the root cause was present from an early stage, and it is difficult to remedy it for a time. It is said that before the war, each piece of stored silk had a principal of 40 yuan. Counting the monthly interest rate of one cent, the interest was 4 jiao.</p>
<p>Interest Rates Are Too High - The Silk Industry Has No Way to Survive</p>
<p>Now, each piece is under pressure, with a principal of 30 yuan and a shortage. Those who are short of money have to borrow. The market interest rate is 1.5 cents per month, and interest of 45,000 yuan should be paid. That is, the price of goods has increased by slightly less than 8,000 times, while the interest has increased by 100,000 times. According to the Silk Broker Association, there are currently 130 to 140 members, including silk floss sellers. About 30 to 40 of them are larger in scale, and dozens of others are brokers with very little capital and sluggish business, who cannot afford various donations and taxes.</p>
<p>Silk Brokers Are Too Painful - Seeking Assistance From the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>They have asked the Chamber of Commerce for assistance. According to sources familiar with the matter, the main business of silk brokers has always been to provide loans to small silk reeling factories and to sell their exports. Now that exports are weak and silk factories are failing, the difficulties of the industry can be imagined. As for the industry's request for assistance from the City Chamber of Commerce, sources from the Chamber of Commerce have revealed that many industries have become brokers out of necessity, and relief should be given in terms of donations and taxes.</p>
<p>Stable Bond Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, only Class A bonds saw stability due to outside idle funds being absorbed by a foreign firm. Class C bonds had eight sales and fell slightly. Class D and E bonds were stable. In the early morning, Class A and B bonds were at 420 yuan, and Class C bonds fell from 740 yuan to 700 yuan. Class E bonds were slightly thinner after opening. Near noon, only Class A and B bonds rebounded to over 450 yuan before closing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Class A and B bonds each rose by 20 yuan, Class C bonds fell by 20 yuan, and Class D and E bonds were unchanged.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Will Rise</h3>
<p>Observations from the American Cotton Industry</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Orleans, 3rd] According to many people, the price of cotton will soon increase to 40 to 50 cents per pound, because the control has been canceled and the official price of 35 cents per pound is no longer valid. Agriculture Director McNutt also said that it may soar to 50 cents per pound in the coming months, while Georgia Agriculture Director Linte said that 50 cents per pound is still quite cheap.</p>
<h3>Gold and Paper Money Change Very Little</h3>
<p>Stable prices with limited changes, limited trading, and little transactions. The morning opening price hovered around 1.885 million. News reported that gold was flowing into China, and there was a slight supply after opening at 1.888 million. The central government distributed 55 bars at a price of 1.885 million. After 10:00 AM, there was a slight downstream decrease to 1.878 million, after which it stabilized. At noon, it stood above 1.88 million. The afternoon situation was more stable, around 1.885 million. As a result, it rose slightly by 3,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments, silver ingots, and silver coins were all stable. The black market exchange rate was between 1 jiao and 1.2 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars were even more mediocre. The opening price was 2,500 yuan, and after opening, the supply and demand were scattered, with no special changes and a very narrow range of fluctuations. The gold market was downstream, falling from 2,510 yuan to around 2,490 yuan, after which it stabilized slightly. At noon, it was struggling around 2,495 yuan. In the afternoon, due to it being Saturday, it was stable. As a result, it fell slightly by 5 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were also mediocre. There were not many chips on the market, and the result was stable.</p>
<h3>Before the Official Lifting of the Ban: A Discussion on Exceptional Export of Yarn and Cloth; Substantial Quantities Already Granted Special Permission by the Authorities</h3>
<p>[Our Report] News has emerged from yarn and cloth circles close to the Textile Reconstruction Company (紡建公司) that the company has recently obtained special permission from Premier Song of the Executive Yuan to ship a substantial amount of cotton textiles to Southeast Asia. It is said that since the government promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade" on March 1st of this year, cotton yarn and cloth have been listed as prohibited export items, with the provision that shipments approved by the government could still be inspected and released by customs, although this was not clearly defined. Therefore, this export is expected to materialize in the near future. The person in charge of the Textile Reconstruction Company stated that they will still apply for the government to formally lift the ban to compete for overseas markets. Authorities in the private cotton textile industry believe that current exchange rates are unfavorable, and yarn mills are suffering from high interest rates. The manufacturing industry cannot compete with foreign goods. The government must abandon its high yarn price policy to allow private industries to follow the government's lead and compete for overseas markets. Reports on whether yarn and cloth exports will be unbanned vary. This news was obtained from reliable sources and is therefore reported.</p>
<h3>Limited Inquiries from Trade Guilds; Yarn Prices Stop Falling and Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market showed signs of improvement. The Guangdong (廣帮) trade guild made inquiries about large-scale yarns such as "Double Horse" (雙馬) and "Surplus Chicken" (余鷄), while the central and small-scale guilds also had merchants from Beijing inquiring and purchasing. Transactions were not stagnant, and the price of 20-count yarn stopped falling and stabilized. However, the sales of fine yarn were limited and showed no improvement. People's minds remained calm, and they are waiting for the autumn sales to begin.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York cotton futures rose 20 to 29 points. The near-term U.S. dollar price was $33.95, the new crop forward price was $31.09, and the Middling spot price was $34.78. Local raw cotton transactions were reduced due to the Saturday closure. The Textile Reconstruction Company and private yarn mills remained in a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in few transactions.</p>
<p>Biji (嗶嘰) leaders, after being sluggish for many days, showed some signs of upward movement, but actual transactions remained scarce. Therefore, other cloth prices remained lifeless. At noon, the Textile Reconstruction Company's opening price was similar to the previous period, with Biji still at 52,000 yuan and Dragon Head (龍頭) at 55,000 yuan, but the number of buyers decreased daily.</p>
<h3>Few Transactions by Major Players; Broad Decline in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were mediocre and weak. The Yong Yarn (永紗) market showed signs of weakening, lacking momentum to rise and eventually declining. The Mei Ya (美亞) market remained relatively stable, with limited fluctuations. The "Three Small Hot" (三小熱) stocks fell from high to low and continued to be sluggish. The movements of various stocks were uneven, with some entering and exiting along the way. Transactions in unpopular stocks were even quieter, with no one driving the market. Market sentiment was depressed, with a slight decline. Major players' entries and exits were scattered, indicating a break. The initial high prices were 713 yuan for Yong Yarn, 3,880 yuan for Mei Ya, 245 yuan for Jingfu (景福), 245 yuan for Xin Guang (新光), and 178 yuan for Qin Yu (勤與). The near-noon low prices were 680 yuan for Yong Yarn, 3,700 yuan for Mei Ya, 232 yuan for Jingfu, 225 yuan for Xin Guang, and 165 yuan for Qin Yu. As a result, Yong Yarn fell 19 yuan compared to the previous close, Mei Ya fell 100 yuan, and the "Three Small Hot" (景福·新光·勤典) stocks each declined slightly. Smaller and medium-sized stocks also saw small declines, and veteran stocks were also slightly weaker.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks fluctuated at low prices, lacking the impetus to rise. Yi Yarn (怡紗) rose slightly in the middle of the session but failed to surpass the previous closing price. Many investors sold off, resulting in a slight decline. Yi Beer (怡啤) fell too much and showed some stability. Xiangtai Timber (祥泰木行) at 4,000 yuan and Ken Zhi (墾植) at 2,500 yuan both had transactions. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yi Beer rose slightly, while Yi Yarn, British Federation (英聯), Jardine Matheson (會德豐), Asia, and Paper all suffered small declines. Ye Guang Iron and Steel (業廣鋼業) decreased by half a percent.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Tobacco Leaves Shipped to Shanghai in Batches; Distributed Equally Among Cigarette Factories</h3>
<p>Recently, foreign goods have flooded Shanghai's commodity markets, severely impacting national industries. Taking cigarettes as an example, American cigarettes, with their attractive packaging and low cost, sell well in the market. Domestic manufacturers, due to high labor costs and lack of raw materials, cannot compete. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau (蘇浙皖敵偽產業處理局) has been actively shipping enemy tobacco leaves received in Qingdao to Shanghai in batches, entrusting the Ministry of Economic Affairs to take over the China Tobacco Company (中華烟草公司) and gradually distribute them to cigarette manufacturers in Shanghai. The principle is to distribute them only to manufacturers registered with the Goods Tax Bureau. The distribution method is to first notify the Cigarette Industry Association (捲烟業同業公會) to inform cigarette factories in the city to fill out applications for purchase based on their actual needs. Then, the allocation is made based on the percentage of the requested amount to the total amount of tobacco leaves available for shipment to Shanghai. For each allocation, manufacturers are invited to view samples, and they are notified to pay at a designated bank according to the price assessed by the Management Bureau. Then, they can exchange the payment slip stub for a warehouse receipt from the China Tobacco Company to take delivery of the goods. Since the beginning, three distributions have been made, totaling about 10,000 barrels. There are more than 10,000 barrels still being shipped to Shanghai and are being actively processed. They will be distributed in batches, ensuring that all applicant manufacturers obtain sufficient raw materials. However, those who abandon their purchase halfway will have their qualification for continued purchase revoked.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Begins Export to America; Strong Interest in Reserved Tonnage</h3>
<p>750 Cases Loaded Today</p>
<p>The SS "Steadway" (史帝威) sailing to New York from Shanghai this afternoon loaded 750 cases of silk and tea from Wu Chang Company (午昌公司), weighing 64,000 pounds. All of it is local Anhui product, named "Xi Chun Huang Xi" (熙春黃熙). In the past, Chinese tea exports to America were mostly black tea. Since the Allied forces came to China to participate in the war, they have increased their interest in silk and tea. After repatriation, they adopted the habit of drinking green tea during conversations, transforming it into a household name. Therefore, this export of the above two types of green tea is a post-war first. The selling price is $0.42 per pound, which is a favorable price. It is also known that the SS "Bali" (拜里) sailing to England on the 20th, stopping at various places along the way, are mostly areas that love to drink Chinese tea. Various Chinese and foreign tea merchants in the city have been actively reserving tonnage in recent days. The total is estimated to be over 4,500 cases. At that time, Jardine Matheson, Concord (協和), Wu Chang, Wang Yu Tai (汪裕泰), Xin Hua (新華), and China Tea Company (華茶公司) also plan to rush to load 800 cases of black tea to England.</p>
<h3>152 Firms Join the Silver and Money Industry Preparatory Committee; National Banks May Also Join</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A person in charge of the preparatory office of the Silver and Money Industry Joint Preparatory Committee (銀錢業聯合準備會籌備處) told reporters yesterday that the office has issued 172 letters inviting various firms and trust companies to join the committee. Currently, 152 companies have responded and joined. The Bank of China (中國), the Bank of Communications (交通), the Farmers Bank of China (中國農民), as well as the China Trust Bureau (中信) and the Postal Remittances and Savings Bureau (郵匯), have not been invited due to their status as national banks. However, according to the past practices of the Bank Joint Preparatory Committee, there is a high possibility that these banks will participate. Although the date for the inaugural meeting has not been determined, it is hoped that it can be established soon. It was also mentioned that after the establishment of the committee, interbank lending will only be used as a temporary adjustment when truly necessary, and it will not be able to provide operating funds to the general industry on a regular basis. It is hoped that all firms will strive for stability in the management of their own business.</p>
<h3>Stagnant Rice Market; Increased Supply of Edible Oil</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 6,000 *shi* (石) of rice arrived in the north and south markets, and digestion was extremely stagnant, with prices gradually declining. Both *geng* (粳) and *xian* (秈) rice fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while medium-quality rice fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Newly arrived *geng* rice from Pudong (浦東) sold poorly at 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and White Yuan (白元) further fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The market trend is still downward.

The oil market had slightly more arrivals, and factories competed to sell, but buyer interest was not strong, falling back by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The supply and demand for soybean cake were both scarce, and the market was flat.</p>
<h3>Fujian and Guangdong Sugar Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the lack of Shantou (汕) shipments, the Chaoqing (潮靑) brands of sugar were scarce, leading to higher prices. The guild initially set a premium of 92,000 yuan. Later, the seller offered 40 bags of high-premium Qing (提靑) at 95,000 yuan and over 80 bags of half-Southern Qing (半南靑) at 88,000 yuan. The Jian (建) guild's implicit opening price for special Qing (刁靑) was 86,000 yuan for 260 bags, and then the explicit opening price was 87,500 yuan for 70 bags. The Xinghua (興化) guild's Xing Chi (興赤) opened at 117,000 to 118,000 yuan, and second-quality White (次白) opened at 127,000 to 128,000 yuan, with over 100 transactions.</p>

There were transactions with Indian merchants through foreign firms, priced at 1,500,000 to 1,550,000 yuan. The opening price was 1,300,000 yuan, but few inquired. The silk market was quiet, and prices did not fluctuate much.</p>
<h3>Hungary Issues New Currency; Old Currency at 200 Million to 1</h3>

<p>[British News Agency, London, 3rd] The periodical "British Glass" recently published an article on a new building material named "Duralite." It is said to be the most innovative, with standard weight and high strength, consisting of two thin layers made of any material, with paper-like cells in the middle. The thickness is variable and can be made into flat or curved surfaces. Each cubic foot of "Duralite" weighs only 15 ounces and can support 10,000 times its weight. It has a wide range of uses. Leading British aircraft manufacturers plan to use it for aircraft floors, doors, and tables. It is also suitable for building interiors, railway vehicles, and furniture. This material also has the characteristics of absorbing vibration and noise. It is manufactured by Cromerks Factory in London.</p>

<h3>Lushan: The Birthplace of National Reconstruction</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Fang Canglang from Guling on the 30th</p>
<p>If the sight and hearing are not exhausted, how can the universe be vast? The river water is as thin as weaving, and Pengcheng is smaller than the palm of your hand. Why should I be so trifling, unable to escape the dust? Returning, I think of self-pity, lowering my head and entering the ant's soil.</p>
<p>— Bai Juyi Climbing Xianglu Peak —</p>
<p>The great citizens of the Republic of China, one of the four powers, are unfortunate that a few "red heroes" who are keen on private struggles have unrestrained ambitions, causing the government to be overwhelmed, the soldiers to be exhausted, the people not knowing where to die, and foreigners shaking their heads and sighing. Thinking about it, it's truly the most unlucky. In this day and age, the whips of life and the days of distress have truly disturbed our 450 million great citizens to the point of "not knowing tomorrow" and "not caring about cold or heat." Therefore, to this day, the number of people who have truly come to Lushan to escape the summer heat is still less than 200. According to the report of Wu Shih-han, Director of the Lushan Administration Bureau, the population of the entire mountain has now reached over 14,000, an increase of five times compared to the September survey of over 2,000 people. However, according to the recent classified statistics of the increased population, it is approximately (1) over 4,000 local residents returning home, (2) 3,000 civil servants (including summer camp staff and trainees), (3) 1,000 seasonal vendors, (4) approximately 1,000 military, police, and constabulary, (5) 3,000 laborers, (6) 100 journalists (including employees of the Lushan editions of the Central Daily News and the China Daily News, as well as correspondents stationed in Guling from newspapers in Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Jiangxi, and other provinces), and (7) approximately 200 dependents of public school personnel and outside summer visitors. From the above statistics, it can be seen that the number of summer visitors to Lushan this year is small, compared to the annual average of approximately 30,000 people per month before the War of Resistance against Japan, with an average of 10,000 people entering the mountain each month, the difference is very large. At a time when other places are suffering from intense heat and Lushan is uniquely cool, the fact that people with money and leisure do not come to Lushan to escape the summer heat shows that today, the heartstrings of people with money are tense, and all living beings have become ants on a hot pan. This phenomenon is noteworthy.</p>
<p>However, precisely because there are few summer visitors and more people sweating, Lushan this year appears even more pure, beautiful, upright, and majestic. Those who remember the history of Lushan nine years ago seem to have a premonition that Lushan this year may again cast a new page in the history of our country. Thus, a large group of reporters followed our Head of State, as well as Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, to Lushan.</p>
<p>A Piece of Incense to Pray for Peace</p>
<p>Readers of newspapers, editors of travel magazines, and travelers who appreciate mountains and rivers can all recite the scenery and spirit of Mount Lu, so we do not need to flaunt our elegance or pretend to be erudite to waste paper. If we are not blind, we should represent those poor people and express the pain deep in our hearts to the mountain spirit. Now, the good people of China, as well as people around the world who sympathize with China, have focused their attention on Lushan in Jiangxi, the land of integrity. Especially those tens of millions of refugees who fled the difficulties of victory, they are homeless, without clothes or food, without anything to show respect to the "red heroes." They can only offer a piece of incense from their remaining piety to our Head of State Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the respectable and lovable Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart. They unanimously pray to Heaven, hoping that in this solemn and pure summer capital of China, some good news can be issued. Even if they are given a single word, a single "peace" or "war," they will laugh with tears in their eyes. But do not "delay," absolutely do not "delay," because if this awkward situation is dragged on, everyone will be dragged to death. They are now dreaming and waiting, they are waiting for the day when a decisive message will be issued from the heights of Guling, regardless of "war" or "peace," regardless of "good" or "bad," they only ask that the country be safe.</p>
<p>The Yuanrong Naturally Has a Plan for National Affairs</p>
<p>Our Head of State Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Special Envoy Marshall, and Ambassador Stuart have already seen the pitiful plight of these war-victorious refugees clearly in various Chinese and foreign newspapers and cannot help but feel sad. However, the Chinese Communist Party issue that has caused millions of refugees is not just a matter of whether the lives and property of millions of people are guaranteed, but a matter of the safety and survival of the entire Chinese nation, and can also be said to be a major issue of whether the entire world can achieve lasting peace from now on. Moreover, this issue is quite complex. Dealing with such a major issue is very different from deploying a war and marching towards a victorious goal. Moreover, inside this issue, in addition to "military," "political," "economic," and "transportation," there are also "others." Therefore, in order to gain more ample time for thinking, and to use some calm and meticulous minds to study this complex, abrupt, and volatile Chinese Communist Party issue, and at the same time to hope that during the period of dealing with this abnormal issue, it will not affect the normal military and political plans, decisions, and strategies. Therefore, all people with conscience in China unanimously recognize that our Head of State Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's visit to Lushan this time is nothing less than a symbol of the bright future of the country. Because everyone knows that during the War of Resistance against Japan, in order to lead the people of the whole country towards the overall goal of winning the war, he could preside over three Supreme Staff Meetings every day, even during the emergency time of military affairs, and even each meeting lasted for three hours. However, purely military issues are quite different from a complex political issue. Dealing with this issue also requires an absolutely vigorous working spirit and a longer working time. It is no wonder that when journalists saw the healthy complexion of the Chairman, everyone said that there was a solution.</p>
<p>Waiting to See the Surrender Document Presented on a Famous Mountain</p>
<p>Now, up to today, Chairman Chiang has spent two weekends in Lushan. Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart have returned to Guling the day before yesterday. Whether the door to peace talks can be opened in the shortest period of time depends on this week. Although no news has been revealed, it seems that for the health of Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, it cannot be delayed any longer. People in Lushan say: Marshal Marshall is already thin, and Stuart is sick (The Ambassador is suffering from a stomach cold today, causing our people to shed tears). Alas, the two old men have suffered enough from this distressing issue. Moreover, at a time when the whole country is angrily calling for "The CCP must withdraw from Subei and Jiaodong, and traffic must be restored," it is indeed like reaching a final turning point.</p>
<p>If history needs to be replayed, this Lushan is the birthplace of the New China. To put it briefly, this famous mountain has decided the great plan for saving the country and the people. The first time, it decided the great plan for suppressing the rebellion. The second time, it decided the great plan for resisting the War of Resistance against Japan. The third time, it decided the great plan for blockading the Madang Estuary to control the bandits. Now, if it is decided again, it will be the fourth time. What we hope for is the great plan for national reconstruction. Our wise Head of State is tirelessly planning. It is said that all plans are for national reconstruction, not for suppressing the rebellion, but it still awaits the final choice of the CCP. If history really needs to be replayed, then the last sentence of Luo Jialun's Lushan Song, "Lushan Prepares to Build the Surrender Platform," will be considered by us to be a good phrase that is beneficial to the political life of the CCP. Please take the Subei battle situation as proof. Force does not seem to be a good way to help a political party. Why play with the fate of the country, devastate the people, and drill into a dead end? The above subjective statements and opinions are all the voices of the people passed down from a group of old Lushan people. Because the reporter, as a mountain resident of Lushan, believes that the mountain residents' understanding of national affairs has valuable historical experience, so he wrote it out, and at the same time, it can also explain that there is no news in Lushan now, Lushan is still waiting, and at this moment, the twenty-odd journalists flying all over Guling Street in Lushan are wasting the valuable money given by the newspaper office to wait for important news.</p>
<p>Weekend Forum</p>
<h3>On the Way Out of China's Political Situation</h3>
<p>— Jiang Junzhang</p>
<p>(1) Depression and Contradiction</p>
<p>The political situation in our China, as it stands today, can be said to have reached the extreme of depression and the extreme of contradiction. Everyone knows that China needs peace, needs unification, and even more so, needs reconstruction, and that the people need to recuperate and thrive. However, almost a year has passed since the victory, has peace been realized? Has unification succeeded? Because these two basic conditions have not been met, the nation's reconstruction and the people's recovery are naturally out of the question. This atmosphere is truly depressing; this phenomenon is truly puzzling.</p>
<p>Since the recapture of Changchun, peace talks have resumed, and the negotiation period has been limited to fifteen days. This news gave us immense hope and comfort. But after fifteen days of unsuccessful negotiations, another eight days were added. After eight days of unsuccessful negotiations, it was followed by an indefinite delay. During this period of delay, the smell of gunpowder spread across the plains of the Huai and Yellow Rivers. Thus, there are so-called organizations striving for peace and organizations against internal strife. Regardless of how different their signs are, the great trend of peace and unification is obvious. Even the most ardent warmongers have to hide behind the grand banner of peace, chanting peace while engaging in sabotage. Therefore, this has increased the current contradictions, but it has made those of us who long for peace even more worried.</p>
<p>Such clever propaganda is easily poisonous to our intellectuals who are only enthusiastic but lack the experience to discern, especially the youth. Just like the spread of germs causing disease, intellectuals with only enthusiasm are like people with weak resistance, and there is a great danger of being innocently harmed. "Epidemic prevention" is an important task. In this depressing and contradictory political situation, pointing out pathways that benefit the country, providing reference for our intellectuals to determine their position, and avoiding being poisoned by propaganda, so as not to mislead the country, is of course also an important task. The author wishes to present the following few opinions based on personal objective observation:</p>
<p>(2) Seeing Clearly the Possible Outcomes</p>
<p>Regarding the current political situation in China, the future evolution will be nothing more than the following five:</p>
<p>(1) Maintaining the status quo of the past year, that is, the so-called talking and fighting, fighting and talking situation, or a situation of talking and fighting simultaneously. That is to say, the problem will never be resolved, the deadlock will never be broken, and finally, the doomsday of national destruction and family ruin will arrive.</p>
<p>(2) Striving to create an ideal situation, which is the grand principle of peaceful unification, and the specific methods are nationalization of the military and democratization of politics. That is to say, the military and territory belonging to political parties or individuals should be handed over to the state to establish a national defense force without party affiliation. At the same time, all political parties should have equal status and be free to participate in political activities, provided that social order and national interests are not hindered. The urgent task at present is to create a constitution suitable for the country in an environment of peaceful unification, so as to organize a national assembly and produce a formal government. Before the constitution is produced, all parties should participate in government work to gather ideas and benefit from diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>(3) Recognizing the existing situation of the Chinese Communist Party, or the government and the Communist Party making some exchanges, transforming the areas where the CCP and the government are intertwined into two neat and distinct parts with clear boundaries. That is to say, dividing China into two, turning it into a China practicing the Three Principles of the People and a China practicing communism, and from then on, China would be formally divided into two countries.</p>
<p>(4) The Communist Party using its power to overthrow the government by force to create a Soviet China.</p>
<p>(5) The government using its power to defeat or resolve all the military forces of the CCP by force to unify the country.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two absolutely impossible outcomes, namely, the Kuomintang handing over its existing political power to the Communist Party, or the Communist Party unconditionally handing over its existing local political power to the National Government. These two methods were originally the simplest and most effective, but in reality, they are almost impossible. Because the motivation for the establishment of a political party is to seize political power. The Kuomintang is the largest party in the country. It has fought for sixty years, overthrown the Manchu Qing dynasty, and defeated the warlords. This time, it led the nation in a bitter eight-year war to defeat Japanese imperialism. The National Government is an internationally recognized government, and most of the country is under the direct rule of the National Government. It has the responsibility to restore order and revive the nation. How is it possible for us to expect such a political party to hand over the political power it has struggled for and abandon its responsibility to serve the country? Similarly, the Communist Party, from the Xiang River Uprising to the "Long March of 25,000 Li," also has a history of several decades. In the past, it did not have a single soldier or a single piece of territory. It still wanted to riot and seize political power. Now, it is said that it has territory in more than 300 counties, an army of nearly one million, and more than a million so-called security forces or militia. Will it hand over these hard-earned things? This is also an incredible miracle.</p>
<p>The above five possible outcomes can be summarized into four characters: "division, unity, governance, and chaos." The first possible outcome and the third possible outcome are phenomena of "division" and trends of chaos. The fourth and fifth outcomes must first go through a stage of war before national unification can be achieved. Only the second outcome can achieve national unification and people's recuperation without war, hence it is called the ideal situation. The creation of this ideal situation originally requires negotiation, but negotiation requires both parties to have the sincerity to solve the problem. If one party is sincere, while the other party only has the intention of exploiting, and only regards it as a means of gaining time and space, then problems within problems and complications beyond complications will inevitably arise, and a conclusion will never be reached. Even if there is a conclusion, it will only be a meaningless document that is difficult to implement. Such negotiations can only produce the first outcome and can never produce the second outcome; and most unfortunately, the past negotiations have been such negotiations.</p>
<p>(3) Finding the Root Cause</p>
<p>The failure of negotiations is because one party does not have the sincerity to solve the problem. Then, which party lacks sincerity? It is very clear that the government must hope to solve the problem to stabilize society, build the country, and thereby ensure the fruitful results of the victory against Japan, and leave the question of which party will hold future political power to the people of the whole country after the constitution is formulated. However, the Chinese Communist Party is a party that believes in armed rebellion to seize political power. In the recent negotiations, the failure to implement the unified compilation of Communist Party troops and the inability to resolve the issue of stationed areas are the main reasons why the deadlock cannot be broken, and the reason why it has become a deadlock is of course because it wants to use these forces to seize political power. The most important method of seizing political power is to constantly expand problems, create chaos and terror, so that the government has no ability to control the overall situation, which is the most favorable opportunity. Chinese history tells us that the demise of a dynasty is mostly due to the misgovernment of the central government, coupled with years of drought and floods, with wailing everywhere, starving people on the roads, and bandits all over the place. People in the countryside rise up to defend themselves, and cunning people take the opportunity to rise up and exploit the situation, creating a situation of fragmentation and chaos, and the old dynasty may be overthrown. The Anti-Japanese War has caused such great losses to our country and people, the occupied areas are so vast, and social order is so unstable. In the eyes of the CCP, this is of course an opportunity to overthrow the government and seize political power, so how can it be willing to easily give up this opportunity? In order to make it more advantageous to seize political power, the CCP must find ways to create problems, expand problems, and even create and expand terror. For example, its anti-American propaganda and anti-American actions are all forcing the mediators of the negotiations to retreat in the face of difficulties. How can it have the slightest sincerity to solve problems with the government? This is the root cause of the ineffectiveness of past negotiations.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the CCP's goal is to use force to overthrow its political enemies and gain real power to rule the country. But why doesn't the CCP simply use a policy of force? The reason is very simple, that is, its current strength is still not enough. If we pay attention to reading the Xinqing Xinhua Daily after the news of victory was released with an objective attitude, we can get two conclusions here:</p>
<p>(1) In the period from August 11 to September of last year, the Xin Hua's statements and news were trying as much as possible to discuss the dispute over the right to surrender and the expansion of the "liberated areas." Today, such and such city was recovered, and tomorrow, such and such city was liberated. There were statistical tables from time to time, explaining how many cities were recovered or liberated. During this period, only in extremely unimportant locations could be found news of stubborn resistance that was difficult to liberate. After September, the news or statistics of liberation gradually decreased, and the statements and news against the civil war gradually took its place. After mid-October, the statements and news against the civil war occupied the most important position, and at the same time brought out the demand for peace. What does this mean? It means that during the CCP's military expansion period, there was talk of civil war, and the development of the war was represented by terms such as uprisings and encirclements of fake regimes. After the CCP's military could not develop or even encountered failure, it began to publicize anti-civil war and peace. Peace and aversion to war are the eager expectations of our compatriots across the country. The Communist Party after military failure publicized anti-civil war and peace, on the one hand, to cater to the hearts of the people across the country, and on the other hand, to cover up its own lack of strength, while at the same time protecting the territory it has already occupied, as a base for future attacks. Therefore, the CCP's saying peace is a means, a means to protect the liberated areas and strength, which is complementary to its central strategy of armed rebellion to seize political power. We must understand this key point before we know that the so-called orders to stop conflict, restore transportation, army reorganization and unified compilation plans, and resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were all produced under this propaganda of using peace as a means. The CCP fundamentally has no sincerity to implement them.</p>
<p>(2) The CCP's call for peace has regional differences. The areas where the most effort to call for peace was found in the Xinhua Daily are the Central Plains Region (i.e., the area east of the Dahong Mountains in Hubei to Mahuang) and the Dongjiang Region (i.e., some mountainous areas in the Dongjiang River in Guangdong), and sometimes the Qiongyai Region is also mentioned. In fact, the areas where the conflicts were the most intense or the situation was the most serious were the Taian area of Shandong, the Kunlian area of northern Henan, such as Yongnian, the Southeast Shanxi area, the Chifeng Pingquan area of Rehe and the Northeast, and recently various places in northern Jiangsu, but the Xinhua Daily rarely found news of the battles in these areas, and sometimes it could find some scattered explanatory or argumentative press releases or essays and talks, which were nothing more than saying that they were passive or self-defense, or even that people were spreading rumors. Sometimes there is news when an important place is recovered or lost and recovered again. The former news always exaggerates how powerful and capable the People's Army is; the latter news always says that the People's Army withdrew because it respected peace or because the mission had been completed. As for news about the destruction of railways and telegraph lines, that is never reported. What does this mean? In my opinion, this shows that the CCP needs peace in areas where its strength is weak, and needs war in areas where its strength is strong.</p>
<p>From these two conclusions, we can know that the CCP's strategy is to use peace as a means and war and seizing political power as the goal. Due to this central strategy, it is carrying out military offensives in coordination with political offensives, so any peace talks are just a performance of the CCP's political offensive, and it is difficult to produce results, and even if results are produced, they are difficult to implement.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we hope that peace talks are effective, there is only one principle under which the goal can be achieved. That is, reluctantly recognize the CCP's military power and territory, and let it formally or informally become a "country within a country," clarify the boundaries, and each maintain the status quo, so that a peaceful result can be obtained. This is the ending of "division." This is the third type of possible ending I mentioned above. This is peace that violates the principle of "unification." How long can such peace last? That depends on when the CCP believes its strength is sufficient. Once that time comes, war will still be difficult to avoid, and the scale of the war will definitely be larger than it is now, and the intensity will be even greater. At that time, if international friction intensifies, and if the country that was devastated in this war has already had a considerable recovery, then the background of China's party problems will be even more complex than it is now. At that time, if international friction decreases or is eliminated, and if the Western problem is largely resolved, then the conflict of China's party problems may really cause international intervention. Therefore, the rhetoric of "international intervention" is so vaguely revealed at this time, perhaps that is the future hope of the CCP. However, in any case, whether this kind of ending is beneficial or harmful to the future of our country and nation, our intellectuals must be able to distinguish it very clearly.</p>
<p>(4) Carefully Choosing Our Path</p>
<p>What our China needs most at present is peace and unification, but because there are two forces developing in the same time and space, there can be no peace or unification. It is like a balance scale, even though the weight on one side is greater and the weight on the other side is less, the side with less weight still has a considerable weight, which prevents the heavier side from suddenly falling down. Therefore, this makes the balance scale a phenomenon of one end high and one end low, neither up nor down. The author has already said that if we want the Chinese Communist Party to achieve its goal of seizing political power by force, it must go through a very long period, and its development power and speed must be greater than the government's development power and development speed. This possible result is to make our descendants of the Yellow Emperor and the Republic of China, and even world peace, perish together. But if we increase the weight of the heavier side of the balance scale, then we can create a situation of a sudden drop, which is naturally much easier. This means increasing the power of the government. The possibility of unification can be increased, the time to strive for peace can be shortened, and the suffering of the people can be reduced. This is a simple and clear trend, and there is no doubt about it. "How will the world be settled? It will be settled by one." Today, the reason why we want to say peace and unification together is still this reason.</p>
<p>Increasing the power of the government will not necessarily lead to a conclusion of unification by force. Let us look at the CCP's acceptance of reorganization in 1937, the CCP's acknowledgement of the Three Principles of the People, and then look at the CCP after the Battle of Suiyuan last year and the CCP after the recent Changchun campaign and the conflict in northern Jiangsu. It is shouting "unconditional ceasefire" again. Its attitude, at least on the surface, is trying to change. Therefore, we can know that when the CCP feels that the difference in strength is huge, it will change its attitude accordingly. Only when it believes that the difference is not very far, it will rely on force even more. A CCP leader said to a friend, "It's not that the CCP is unwilling to sign a treaty of surrender, but it's only good to sign it when it's absolutely necessary." This truly reveals the CCP's inner thoughts.</p>
<p>Therefore, intellectuals who are concerned about the current situation, intellectuals who are willing to participate in political activities, do you really need China to have a long period of chaos, allowing the CCP to develop its power, and causing the country, the nation, and world peace to perish together? Then you might as well speak more for the CCP, weaken the government's power more, and increase the CCP's momentum. Otherwise, do you really hope that China will be peacefully unified? Then, you must increase the government's power and reduce the CCP's arrogance, and the CCP will have no choice but to change its attitude. The political stance must be based on the interests of the country and the nation as the standard for decision-making. Private grievances should not be considered, and personal honor and disgrace should not be the deciding factors. In particular, one should not just complain and lament one's fate in vain. Otherwise, one will inevitably go astray and mislead the country and the nation.</p>

<h3>"Parasite Grass" Actors</h3>
<p>— Guan Yu</p>
<p>The "Parasite Grass," recently performed by the Art Troupe, is a play that Mr. Hong Shen translated a long time ago. This play depicts a young mistress-type character who refuses to move. She not only parasitizes society and her family, but also parasitizes everyone close to her. This "parasite grass" type of illness was finally cured by her brother. The medicine to cure this illness is jealousy in love.</p>
<p>This is a comedy, satirizing this type of young mistress! It can make every wife, miss, and young mistress think about it after watching it, to think about whether she has this parasitic disease. If she does, she can quickly change it.</p>
<p>The young mistress is played by Ding Zhi. This is the first time Ding Zhi has shown her acting skills on stage since the victory. Although we haven't seen any special acting skills from her, we can already see that she has grasped the character. The most obvious point in the whole play is her lazy appearance every time she goes upstairs: humming in her mouth, twisting her body weakly, her neck seeming to be unable to support her head, making her head tilt from side to side, her hands holding the handrails of the stairs, slowly, step by step, going upstairs. This can fully express the character she is playing.</p>
<p>The first time she came down the stairs, she didn't immediately sit down on the single sofa in the center of the stage. She just stood next to the sofa and directed others to bring her a magazine. When others brought it to her, she also took a few steps to receive it, and then sat down. If she sat in the sofa and then directed others to bring her something, I wonder if it would better express her "parasite grass" character. Although this is a small point, the first introduction of the character must be especially solemn.</p>
<p>Bao Gengwen is meeting the audience for the first time on the Shanghai stage. His acting skills are clearly highlighted here. Although he is an optimistic character and has returned home from afar to see his sister, he can express the happy situation in his heart through his external actions. However, because the acting skills of other actors are not exaggerated enough, he has become a "comedy character" here. Although we don't find it annoying, we feel that he is overdoing it. The scene in the whole play that can make people feel the most satisfied is the scene of cutting and arranging flowers in the first half of the second act: there are no words on the stage, just watching him arrange flowers. If he really finished cutting and arranging the flowers and put the vase on the table, then we would feel that his acting skills were overdoing it again. Fortunately, after he finished cutting and arranging, he suddenly threw the flowers in the vase on the table and cursed. At this time, we can know that he is deliberately teasing his parasitic sister.</p>
<p>The performance of the whole play is not bad. There are no major artistic flaws. It is much better than those performances where each actor shows off their own talents and develops freely on the stage.</p>
<h3>The Formal School in Acting (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>Meyerhold's first period was one of movement, while his second period was the exact opposite: stillness. Actually, he was engaged in a program of poses to replace a program of actions. His great performance, "The Inspector General," can be regarded as the culmination of this period. It attempts to intertwine a series of poses, but the overall structure remains static, with any movement often being directed by mechanical forces.</p>
<p>The movement of objects triggers emotional responses through the power of their combined forces. The effect of the sensation stimulates the psychological response. A cigar or a fan in the hands of an actor is no longer simply a cigar or a fan; it symbolizes all the values associated with the relationship between these objects and their user.</p>
<p>Meyerhold's characters are also symbolic objects. Although they now wear realistic costumes, there is still some emphasis on trivial objects, with a certain degree of exaggeration.</p>
<p>In Moscow, everyone can understand their own emotions and may need the guidance of a director. However, a theater that primarily focuses on external forms relies on the actor's position in the group on the stage. Actors have no access to the overall form, and depend on the director, sitting in the audience, to tell them when and how to match the stage composition.</p>
<p>Composition—Compositional understanding replaces decoration, and many strange things and characters are woven into fantasy forms.</p>
<p>He himself said that he used actors like a sculptor uses clay, creating different works and achieving different effects. Therefore, the most malleable actors become his best actors.</p>
<p>All of his actors are like rubber balls. He throws them out, and the balls have to bounce, otherwise they are useless to him. But it's impossible for a rubber ball to bounce on its own. A good rubber ball is silent and has no right to act independently. Meyerhold's theater does not allow for individual intelligence. Meyerhold himself supplies all the intelligence, just as he supplies all the skills. However, many actors are excellent but unwilling to act as rubber balls, and no matter how good they are, they are thrown away. Therefore, it is naturally not easy for Meyerhold to maintain a good line of actors.</p>
<p>Meyerhold is not like Stanislavski, who seeks methods suitable for actors. Instead, he seeks an interpretation that is closest to his own. He already knows the exact speed and cadence of each word, and the actor only needs time to learn it accurately.</p>
<p>Every movement, every blink, every piece of music, every prop and costume – as long as it is among those three hundred people, they have already defined the play. By the four hundredth person, the public performance is almost complete.</p>
<p>He seems to know what every position and every movement looks like, and knows the internal reasons and external effects, and the audience's reaction. He explains all of this to the actors and tells them how to do it, step by step, pose by pose. He builds up the entire play's actions, while the actors remain still, waiting for Meyerhold's movements. Then, just like reciting lines, he uses Meyerhold as an example.</p>
<p>His control over the entire play has made it impossible for good actors to work with him. Similarly, the best designers are also unwilling to work with him, because in his presence, they are little more than foremen.</p>
<p>Meyerhold is a singular figure. After his death, there will be no successors. His contribution is simply to provide the impetus for theatrical revolution.</p>
<p>Stanislavski tells actors to forget they are on stage, Tairov says actors should forget everything, and Meyerhold says actors are part of the audience.</p>
<p>Theater biomechanics is actually the application of compositional or mechanical theory to actors. It assumes that the actor is a rather peculiar machine composed of many machines. The new problem for the theater is how to enable each part of this machine to function perfectly. Muscles, tendons, representing flexible living plugs, cylinders, etc., work with all their strength, according to the mission issued by the brain along the spinal cord and reaching the nerve center, and convey its proper meaning.</p>
<p>The laws of theater biomechanics are based on the study of human psychological structure. The purpose of this system is to enable people to understand the mechanism and laws of its structure, and thus be able to use it completely. It has established an analytical principle to distinguish various body movements, and can be fully used to express emotions. Previous theories of acting based on emotions assumed that the mechanism of the human body was ignorant, and used technical education to train the actor's intelligence, develop his body through games, and thus cultivate a vibrant actor who fully possesses the keyboard of body and mind, and is able to increase his divine inspiration. Now theater biomechanics rises up to replace this theory. Those who apply theater biomechanics to the theater aim to enable actors to control their own movements, rather than movements controlling the actors. This has become the ideal proof of organic human body and its mechanics.</p>
<p>At that time, poster plays were used as weapons of struggle. Speaking of this kind of reform, I think the important characters are too generalized, just like the outline of an advertisement. Their enthusiasm is the party slogans listed on the posters affixed to every corner and every plane.</p>
<p>These plays require specially trained key actors. The training method is as follows: words should be reread while acting in sign language, which can make people pay attention to the expression of the voice and create an atmosphere. Its effect is more powerful when the dialogue is divided by reading aloud and singing. Later, this kind of dialogue was called telegraphic dialogue. Its meaning is that the pronunciation is like the way of slogan-like dialogue, with its own unique and complete rhythm. This method of reading scripts is determined by the agitational effect that actors should first pay attention to, just like an experienced political speaker carefully considers the words he uses to move the audience. Gestures are also based on the same theory. Gestures match sounds, just as sounds match meaning, and the gestures of the arms have the same nature as the "gestures of words." This is the basis of a laborious method that requires very hard research.</p>
<p>What he sought was a new type of actor, an actor who could accurately control his body, with all his movements, and with a healthy briskness and liveliness.</p>
<p>He and psychology are too far apart. When changing a character, he felt the need to explain and emphasize the good and bad qualities, based on today's class consciousness. The bad qualities must be exaggeratedly described, and the good qualities must be refined and brought to the pinnacle of heroism. Meyerhold did not use words like "experience" or "emotion" to think about actors, but rather regarded actors as supervisors of the people, prepared to lead those whom he encouraged.</p>
<p>His foundation is built on juxtaposing contrasts. Therefore, it's a mix of tragedy and comedy, the most sublime and cruelly distorted emotions. (End)</p>
<h3>Movie Records</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Recently, the movie records we hear on the radio are often old antiques, even the "Fisherman's Song" from over a decade ago has been dug up.</p>
<p>Because victory is nearly a year away, most record companies are unable to recover. At the moment, the only record companies in Shanghai are Greater China, Victor, and Pathé. Victor is American-owned, Pathé is British-owned, and only Greater China is owned by us Chinese. And none of these three companies have released a new record.</p>
<p>Until now, Greater China has only released six records: Zhou Xuan's "Victory Founding Song," Zhao Dan's "Victory Song" and "Welcome Soldiers," etc. It is said that they plan to release three records per month in the future. As for Pathé and Victor, they will probably release new records in the near future as well.</p>
<p>The record industry is a type of cultural enterprise, and especially in the field of music and art, it has a close relationship with mass education. Therefore, we must make efforts to assist in the promotion of records.</p>

<h3>Thirteen Kinds of Kisses - Marie McDonald's Experience</h3>
<p>— Gang Ren</p>
<p>If you're a lucky one, Marie can tell you about thirteen kinds of kisses, from "Cutie" to "Kiss of Death."</p>
<p>She says, "Using their fingertips, no! Their lips, a woman can get anything from a man, even his precious life."</p>
<p>Marie is recognized as the woman most skilled at kissing on screen. She used only four "kisses" from her "warehouse" to hold the hearts of Lawford and Calhoun, which you can see in her Universal new film "Pirates of Monterey."</p>
<p>Now let's write about the text from her mouth!</p>
<p>One. "Her first kiss on the list is the "Cutie", just a quick peck on the man's nose."</p>
<p>Two. "The "Cheek Peck" is a full expression of friendship."</p>
<p>Three. She said, "At the same time there is also a "Social Kiss" which is also the same peck."</p>
<p>Four. "The "Wind Kiss" is an air kiss."</p>
<p>Five. "The most clever and slippery is the "Ear Kiss", lightly stroking his ear with pursed lips."</p>
<p>Six. "A cunning kiss is the "Hand Kiss", giving him a breathing kiss on the lips."</p>
<p>Seven. This kiss should be more generous, especially suitable for college campuses, willingly given, but relatively hasty."</p>
<p>Eight. "The following one is the "Top Kiss", making a kissing sound on the top of the other person's head, which is especially suitable for a lovely dad."</p>
<p>Afterwards, Miss Marie talked about more serious kisses.</p>
<p>Nine. "Neck Kiss". At that moment, lovers who embrace and hang on arms, the girl can lift her head and lightly kiss the neck under his ear."</p>
<p>Ten. This kiss should be "Lovers Kiss" then. Often accompany with heated embrace, nothing but love!"</p>
<p>Eleven. Similar to Lover’s kiss is “fiance”, which is more cautious.”</p>
<p>Twelve. "Hasban" is what a wife gives to her husband.</p>
<p>Thirteen. The last one is"Whamdodie". It is commonly used."</p>
<p>Finally, it is the death kiss."</p>
<p>"Lassie Come Home" is a Technicolor film set in England, telling the story of a dog and a child. Lassie is a dog loved by that boy so deeply, but one time it was taken by an earl, and raised in luxury in cage with comfortable living. But it prefers to give up the silk cloth and delicacy for a life that is not being cared for. It finally escaped, back to the child's simple home.</p>
<p>It is a touching film, telling people the love of animals is loyal and sincere. It is said that MGM decided to show the film around the sixth day of this month to kind citizens throughout the city, calling on behalf of the Shanghai International Society for the Protection of Animals: "Love animals."</p>
<h3>Weekly Movie Short Reviews</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>There are no particularly good films this week, except for "The Seventh Veil," which is still good, but it doesn't have much innovation in its handling techniques.</p>
<p>The Bloody Road</p>
<p>Although the script is weak, like a myth, it is for promotional purposes, which is understandable. Because of the director's agile editing, this film has become the best of this week's films. From the opening to the forced landing of the plane, it is impeccable. Of course, there are also shortcomings, mainly because there are too many coincidences. The best actor is Zhi Lunhai, who is clean-handed and lovely. Errol Flynn is just average.</p>
<p>Our Time</p>
<p>The script is stiff, and the connection between the anti-Japanese war in the latter part and the former part is not good. The director handled several small scenes very well, such as the scene of a couple drinking late into the night until 3:30 in the hotel, which is very good. It is reasonable and good to add thin cigarette smoke or cigarette circles to the screen several times in the film, which is very novel. The anti-Japanese war section in the latter part is too perfunctory, which is a failure. Ida Lupino is excellent as an actress. There is also a supporting actor, the old man Michael Chekhov, who performs better than Ida. Paul Henreid is not outstanding.</p>
<p>The Seventh Veil</p>
<p>The prose-like treatment lacks stability, and the shots lack a new feel, but the opening scene is excellent, without saying a word. The performance is above par, and the use of famous songs is also a clever way. As for the actors, James Mason is not as ideal, and Ann Todd is very hard-working.</p>
<p>To Have and Have Not</p>
<p>The continuity of the play cannot be said to be skillful. Clark Gable has only a few small actions worth mentioning, and Lana Turner is very coquettish. The first part is better than the second part. It is very suitable for her to play a hot girl who pleases men with her charm and beauty. Today's popularity in Hollywood can be seen in this film. As for the director, the ending is what catches the audience, but the others are average. The section in Hanoi in the latter part is not as good as the previous section.</p>
<p>Diamond Horseshoe</p>
<p>The scene is not grand enough, and the relaxation is not lively enough. It only relies on the help of the actors. John Payne has no part to play, Betty Grable is still competent, and Victor Mature's amorous gestures are not bad. As for the director, the introduction of Betty's appearance is the worst, and the best part is Betty's performance of the "shadow boxing dance." The ending is not strong enough.</p>
<p>The Bandit of Sherwood Forest</p>
<p>The structure of the story is special. The protagonist is not a hero, but is close to being a rude man, but it cannot be said that the performance is very successful. The director took too many dark scenes, which has the disadvantage of suppressing the audience's joy. Actor Mai Lai Gu has not exerted his talent, and Luo Taiyang is excellent, especially after the murder of his old lover, his inner pain is all externalized, which is unmatched by new stars.</p>

<h3>The Negation of Art</h3>
<p>— Mo Yu</p>
<p>Lu Xun spent half of his life exposing the ignorance and foolishness of our compatriots, but to this day, we still see many people who specialize in criticizing the works of others leading the spread of this trend, which can at least be said to be a painful tragedy of this era.</p>
<p>In the past few days, several Shanghai newspapers have continuously written many articles on Gao Tianxin and even Liu Shi's works that were similar to abusive curses. We certainly have nothing to say about the merits and demerits of this kind of writing itself, but we feel that the critic's fundamental negation of the original art existing in this era is very disappointing.</p>
<p>China, which has endured eight years of suffering in the torrent of the War of Resistance, also has a complete fragmentation in art like other political economies: Fragmentation will not disappoint us, because it is only the catharsis and record of the pain that art workers have expressed after a long period of hard tempering. This, as a record of the process of a turbulent era, is just like the brief commotion in the art world after the French Revolution. It will eventually be complete because of the art workers' ardent pursuit of light after breaking free from the darkness. China is still struggling in an era where the cost of living is five thousand times higher, and art workers still have to continuously fight against the hunger that dominates their own destiny. It is really impossible to force them to write melodies and movements as complete as Chopin's at the moment.</p>
<p>I have not seen many of the works of Gao, Liu and others, but their devotion to artistic work is at least worthy of admiration. In this commercial society where gold is supreme, people are indifferent to the act of picking up a pen and scribbling a few strokes on a blank sheet of paper, writing a few sentences. Because of this, this work of eating grass is even more worthy of cherishing; In the near future, the art of this twentieth century will inevitably have a bright and complete future. We need someone to work hard on this vast journey in piecemeal and serious way. Even if he is moving a pile of mud, or picking up a few stones, he can be regarded as having done his best effort for the future of the art of this era.</p>
<p>Chinese artistic achievements originally had a very brilliant past, but the regrettable thing is that even these few achievements were negated by the ignorance and foolishness of our compatriots. When the American soldiers first came to Shanghai after the victory and indulged in the many dazzling Chinese embroideries and exquisite handicrafts, they were satirized by general critics in a roundabout way. This is a strong proof that our ignorance and foolishness has cut into the confidence and tradition of our country's art; on the one hand, we marvel at the greatness and singularity of the artistic works displayed in foreign museums, even those before our Tang and Song dynasties, but on the other hand, we are intentionally or unintentionally trying to shovel away the milestones of our own country's emerging art. Is this the painful tragedy in this era? Is this also the shameful ignorance and foolishness of our compatriots and critics?</p>
<p>I have seen several predecessors who dedicated themselves to the news business, spending a lot of time every day to study and select the works of others, even those of younger generations, one article after another, so carefully, without being prejudiced at all; he entrusted his entire life and vitality to the paving work of art. This spirit of affirmation and seriousness, sincerity and piety towards art is worthy of alerting us, because isn't this era filled with a frivolous atmosphere of specializing in negating the artistic works of others?</p>
<p>Tao Yuanming was regarded as a flaw in the jade because of an article "Idle Sentiments", and Zhu Shuzhen avoided the criticism of infidelity because of two sentences "The moon is on the willow tip, people are after dusk". I always feel that this is a redundant page in history; we should remember that Chinese art works are still breathing, and they are still very poor. History is moving forward, we should not use ancient ignorance and foolishness to negate and stifle its progress.</p>
<h3>The Grand Reunion in Literary Works</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xingyu</p>
<p>Talented scholar and beautiful lady novels of the Ming and Qing dynasties were often written according to the formula of "private engagement in the back garden, disgraced scholar wins the top examination." They generally described a previously destitute person later becoming successful in officialdom, or favored by those in power, thus acquiring three wives and four concubines, returning home in glory, and bringing honor to ancestors. Once this point was reached, the story would no longer continue. We often call this formulaic ending a grand reunion. The most fatal flaw of talented scholar and beautiful lady novels is the grand reunion, yet the vulgar petty bourgeoisie welcomes this, appreciates this. This is a question worthy of our careful study.</p>
<p>The Chinese people attach great importance to the word "end." The Book of Documents even lists "dying a natural death" as one of the Five Blessings, meaning that being able to die peacefully without suffering is a kind of happiness. Therefore, when lower-class people have quarrels, they often curse each other with "may you not die a good death." They emphasize this "end" not only for people but also for things. The most exquisite dishes are served only when the banquet is about to end, and famous actors' performances are saved for the finale. Therefore, they stubbornly demand a complete ending for literary works as well. Before the May Fourth Movement, China did not produce Ibsen's "Nora" type of problem plays because the answer required the reader to ponder, and fundamentally did not constitute an ending.</p>
<p>It is understandable why the bourgeois class appreciates the grand reunion. Their artistic cultivation is relatively lacking, and their interests are more low-level and narrow. They spend money to buy a book or a theater ticket with the purpose of entertaining themselves, allowing their emotions and muscles to relax. Having already spent money, shedding tears seems like an unwise deal. People with artistic cultivation are different; they can appreciate the humor of "Don Quixote" and the sorrow of "An Icelandic Fisherman" because these are both the truth of life, just as sweetness and bitterness are both flavors.</p>
<p>Since the Xinhai Revolution, titles like "top scholar" and "prime minister" have long become historical terms. With the occurrence of the May Fourth Movement, women's rights activists exposed the unwholesomeness and immorality of the system of three wives and four concubines. Thus, the grand reunion changed its nature. The endings of stories often involved Mr. A and Ms. B taking the "Contessa" liner to Hong Kong for their honeymoon, or "songs echoing in the valley, spring is ours," etc. When the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, the grand reunion infiltrated anti-Japanese war literature. The endings of works were uniformly the recovery of cities, the deaths of Japanese devils, the capture of traitors, and the cheering of the masses for the guerrillas. Once the formula was established, the works inevitably became stereotyped, resulting in the so-called "Eight-legged Essay of the Anti-Japanese War."</p>
<p>If it is said that writers completely create grand reunions to cater to the readers or audiences of the bourgeois class, this is not entirely true. Let us try to observe from the writer's own perspective: ordinary people only find compensation for their defects—spiritual and material comfort—in dreams. Therefore, beggars dream of white rice, and travelers dream of returning home. This is completely subconscious. Writers, in addition to subconscious dreams, can also have a conscious method of consolation, which is their work. The group of struggling scholars who initially wrote talented scholar and beautiful lady novels imagined themselves as the male protagonists in the books, writing articles more brilliant than Ban Gu and Ma Rong, appearances surpassing Song Yu and Pan An, relying on beautiful wives and concubines, living in pavilions and towers, and finally ending with complete satisfaction, which was originally a symptom of a perverted psychology, wanting to escape from the real world, using this method to deceive and satisfy themselves.</p>
<p>The reason why we criticize the tendency towards grand reunions is not to deny the possibility that some things in the world can come to a satisfactory conclusion, but because the same thing will never be repeated without any change in different times and spaces. It is because writers' life experiences are extremely poor, and they simply create based on borrowed concepts and imitation. Without talking about its content or its consciousness, it is impossible to be figurative even in terms of technique.</p>
<p>The tendency towards grand reunions contains a philosophy of fatalism and mechanism, believing that everything is predestined and that everything is controlled by gods, thus talented scholars must be romantic, officials must be snobbish, beautiful ladies must be affectionate, maids must act as matchmakers, and even guerrillas must be cheered by the masses. Fatalism completely ignores the subjective conditions within events and the objective environment outside of things, and mechanism completely forgets that the world is in constant motion. Fatalism and mechanism are the most superficial and unhealthy philosophies.</p>
<p>Another tendency opposite to the grand reunion is Thomas Hardy's "The Return of the Native," "Tess of the d'Urbervilles," etc. There are also such works in China, where the ending is always extremely bleak, just a dark shadow, a kind of irreparable despair. Lu Fen's novels, especially "Wild Bird Collection," express this characteristic most clearly. This is also a philosophy of fatalism and mechanism, and should also be criticized.</p>
<p>A thing can have various different results, and a novel can also have various different endings. Works faithful to life will never fall into the formulaic rut. Grand reunions are not impossible to write, but don't force them, just put them on as a set.</p>
<h3>Church</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhen carved</p>
<h3>Childishness</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Once you become a person, you unconsciously put on a pair of shackles—because you are a person.</p>
<p>Sarcasm, disdain, ridicule... you must be constantly vigilant.</p>
<p>When someone occasionally says a few words of warm encouragement, it is truly like sweet spring water in the desert, and you are so flattered that you almost shed tears. But when you raise your head and see a hypocritical and cunning face, how indignant you become—but it is only indignation, and no matter how fiery your anger is, it can only be buried in the deepest part of your heart.</p>
<p>Between people, there are clearly traps laid out, a situation of drawn swords and cocked crossbows where they fight to the death, yet they must be adorned with a layer of sugar coating full of poison.</p>
<p>A straightforward beating or a straightforward scolding would be fine, but it can't be done.</p>
<p>I envy children: I envy children's innocent smiles, I envy children's innocent cries, I envy children's ability to clearly distinguish between good and evil.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when innocence is combined with affectation, it is just ugliness and suffering.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, something about it allures me, guides me, and I imitate children.</p>
<p>All sarcastic remarks, I just pretend not to understand, and I just smile foolishly; I also pretend not to understand and slip cold arrows into my words to vent a bit of dark and stifled annoyance.</p>
<p>Some friends say, "You're still so naive," and some people criticize behind my back, "That guy is too childish." I smile, it's not that I don't understand, it's that I understand too much. I'm not naive, and I'm not childish; these are just my smoke screen and mask. Pretending is painful, but at least it gives me temporary freedom and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Why shouldn't I do this?</p>
<p>I have the right to scold these people, even though there are still people around them praising and flattering them. I don't want to be a pitiful little tail; everyone should have their own will.</p>
<p>I can speak my mind frankly, but those self-proclaimed seniors put on a condescending and bureaucratic air: "You don't understand, you're still young." Fine, then I'll just put on a child's mask and teach those people a lesson!</p>
<p>However, the more I act childish, the more clearly I feel that the childish spirit is gradually leaving me, leaving only affectation, which is truly lamentable.</p>
<h3>The "Organ Grinder Ghost" Talks about Dance Hall Music</h3>
<p>— Liang Xiyan</p>
<p>A friend told me: "This is a very sad thing: a classmate of mine, Mr. So-and-so, who had extremely high musical talent, has now become an organ grinder ghost in some dance hall."</p>
<p>Music being used as a tool for low-level eroticism is the sorrow of music, and a person who studies music becoming a performer of erotic jazz is the end of the road for a musician. But society is also too cruel, adding the name "organ grinder ghost" to these dance hall "musicians," making it impossible for them to ever turn over a new leaf. In fact, the "musicians" in dance halls, although they play extremely low-level and shallow music, may not be without transcendent talent. They only sacrifice their opportunities for artistic development in order to eat, burying their own talent for the sake of life. In China, orchestral bands are too underdeveloped, and the general level is pitifully low. It is actually extremely sympathetic that those with musical talent end up as "organ grinder ghosts"!</p>
<p>Of course, foreign countries also have dance hall music, but their orthodox music already has a strong foundation, and they don't allow many highly talented musicians to become "organ grinder ghosts."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Music Association once considered the issue of dance hall music, but has not yet made a concrete decision. I believe that extracting some truly talented performers from the dance hall "musicians" and allowing their artistic skills to be brought into the right direction is one solution. Also, moderately raising the level of dance hall music so that the jazz is like jazz and doesn't just mess around endlessly is also very necessary!</p>
<p>Jazz was created in South America in 1914. Originally, it only used brisk rhythms and lively melodies to stimulate the nerves of the audience. Although the artistic value is reduced, it cannot be absolutely excluded from the realm of music. But today, this jazz is becoming increasingly out of tune, turning into a messy, comical, purely erotic thing. And in Shanghai dance halls, it is especially terrible. It is coupled with nasal singing by female singers, which also wins strong applause.</p>
<p>This situation will cause pain to every true lover of music! We know that dance hall music has its reasons for existing, but there should be a limit! Don't let excellent talent be buried here, and don't let these sounds destroy people's hearing without limit!</p>
<h3>Queen Charlotte</h3>
<p>— Painted by Gainsborough (1727-1788)</p>
<p>Displayed in the Victoria Museum, London</p>
<p>Thomas Gainsborough was one of the greatest portrait and landscape painters in British history. Born in Sudbury, he loved to depict the beautiful scenery near his hometown in his childhood. At the age of fourteen, he went to London to study painting. In his early years, he was unknown. It was not until 1760, when he moved to Bath, a famous hot spring area, that he became slightly famous for painting portraits. In 1774, he went to London, and soon gradually became the rival of the greatest painter of the time, Sir Joshua Reynolds. The two had very different styles and shared the world equally. The Londoners who admired Gainsborough and those who admired Reynolds were roughly equal in number. He was one of the founders of the Royal Academy, and his works were displayed at the first art exhibition of the Academy.</p>
<p>Gainsborough's landscape paintings were a precursor to the naturalist school of landscape painting in modern times, and his portraits, especially portraits of women, all have a lightness and beauty that is unmatched.</p>
<h3>Rambling Talk on National Painting</h3>
<p>— Yu Lu</p>
<p>As for national painting today, there are many schools, but few are orthodox. Scholarly attainments are not deep, cultivation is insufficient, and coupled with the trend of the times, they often like to show off by referring to new methods of Western painting. The result is neither Chinese nor Western. It is already difficult to achieve verisimilitude, and even more so to achieve spirit and breath. It is said that a certain painter thousands of years ago was famous at the time for being proficient in both Chinese and Western painting. But critics said that Mr. So-and-so's Western painting was so lifelike that the Chinese sighed in admiration, and Mr. So-and-so's national painting was so ingenious that Westerners were amazed. This is probably inevitable flattery. However, this shows that the true value of painting has nothing to do with the taste of the common people.</p>
<p>After Lu Lianfu and the Ren brothers of Shanyin, there have been many talented painters in Shanghai over the past few decades. The Zhang Daqian brothers are famous in the Jiangnan region as people of Sichuan. Most others are from Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The best among them should be Feng Chaoran, Wu Hufan, and Zheng Wuchang. Wuchang's landscapes occasionally imitate Shi Tao, and his painting relies entirely on inspiration. Hufan's paintings are known for their clarity and elegance, while Chaoran is known for his antiquity and vigor. In the past, Di Pingzi greatly admired him. Wuchang still has a price list, but Feng and Wu are too busy to handle the many requests. Feng and Wu live in the same neighborhood on Shanshan Road, living in close proximity, and often enjoy singing and harmonizing with each other. When the inspiration comes, they wield their brushes freely, never tiring all day long. Only Feng's paintings are asked to verify their authenticity. Someone once asked Feng about a work that was suspected to be copied, and he smiled and said, "Those who know will naturally distinguish it, why bother to care?" Feng is proficient in landscapes, flowers and birds, figures, and ladies, but in recent years, he has focused on landscapes, with powerful strokes and meticulous composition. It is said that Feng did not participate in the Shanghai Artists Association exhibition in early June. A hanging ink painting borrowed by the association is probably his work.</p>
<h3>Sunday</h3>
<p>— Written by George Gissing, translated by Ma Yufeng</p>
<p>George Gissing is a modern British writer. "Sunday" is translated from "The Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft," a book that is famous in literary circles. Some even say that it is the most elegant work of English prose in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>On Sunday I get up later than usual, I change my clothes, because it is appropriate to take off the usual work clothes on the spiritual day of rest. Indeed, I usually don't have any work, but Sunday also brings me quiet. I am immersed in the quietness of the world, and my thoughts are more completely detached from the busy world than usual.</p>
<p>How does this house of mine create the quietness of Sunday indoors? This is hard to see, because it is usually so quiet that there is almost no sound. However, I myself can see the difference. The maid walks into my room with a Sunday smile, and she seems happier on this day, and her happy appearance also makes me happy. She speaks in a gentler voice than usual, and the clothes she wears make me feel that only the simplest and cleanest work is done in my home. She goes to church both morning and evening, and I know this is very good for her. When she is out, I often inspect the rooms that I don't usually enter. Indeed, within the realm of a virtuous woman, the shining cleanliness and order make my eyes feel joyful. If there were no clean kitchen, what would be the use of me keeping books and hanging pictures? All the quiet in my life depends on the honest care of this woman, who lives and works in places I cannot see. I believe that the reward I give her is the smallest part of the reward she receives. She is an old-fashioned woman, performing what she believes to be her duty, which is the purpose in her eyes. The work she completes is itself her satisfaction and pride.</p>
<p>In childhood, on Sunday, I was allowed to read some books that I could not easily touch on weekdays. These were books with beautiful illustrations, or elaborately bound books by famous authors, or books that required special attention because they were thick. Fortunately, these books all belonged to high-level literature, therefore, in my mind, an inseparable association was formed between the greatest names in poetry and the Sabbath. I retain this habit throughout my life. I often think of quietly spending some of my Sunday time on books that are usually easy to put aside. In order to favor the pleasing appearance of newly published books, I neglect them under the guise of knowledge and love for new books. Homer and Virgil, Milton and Shakespeare, there have not been many days in the past Sundays when I did not read the works of these people. Not many Sundays? No, this is a habit that people easily fall into exaggeration. Rather, I would say that on many Sundays, I have discovered such a mood and opportunity to read. Even today, mood and opportunity will never abandon me. When I am happy, I can take down my Homer or my Shakespeare. However, to form a special friendship with these books, I feel that Sunday is the most appropriate. Because these great men wearing immortal crowns do not allow people who are enthusiastic about worldly struggles to approach them. A solemn and leisurely attitude and a tendency towards peaceful thoughts are suitable for them. I formally flip through picture albums. If the word sacred has any meaning, is this not sacred? When I read, no obstacles can appear in front of me. The singing of the cardinals, the buzzing of the bees, these are the sounds surrounding my sanctuary. When I turn the pages of the book, there is almost no sound.</p>

<h3>Random Remarks</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Heaven has unpredictable weather, and man has unexpected fortunes. In the current view, this is not vague and unfounded, nor is it the work of any god, but has a completely scientific basis.</p>
<p>Like the weather the day before yesterday and yesterday, it was not only hot but also stuffy. Whether it is hot or stuffy, it comes suddenly. Anything that moves violently will inevitably have an unstable foothold. There will inevitably be sudden changes in between.</p>
<p>When a person becomes rich suddenly, his lifestyle will never be balanced and peaceful. Many things that never existed in the past or could not be imagined will often happen to his family and himself. The reason lies in accidental abnormality. Heaven and man are originally the same principle. The so-called weather and fortunes are by no means from thin air.</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Feng Zikai once expounded the philosophy of "gradualness." Preventing problems before they arise, "gradualness" is indeed the most terrible demon. Unconsciously, in daily life, it completes its deeply rooted power. But when it breaks out, I often regard it as unpredictable, as sudden. In form, it seems to be so, but in fact, it has been a long time coming.</p>
<p>Therefore, we don't need to be alarmed by the things that appear or encounter in our lives. After careful consideration, it is not difficult to find its clues.</p>
<h3>The Arduous Struggle of the Chemical Industry - The Past and Present of the Yongli Company</h3>
<p>— Fanshi</p>
<p>Speaking of China's chemical industry, we can't help but think of Mr. Fan Xudong, who passed away nearly a year ago, and the Yongli Chemical Industry Company, which he founded and dedicated his life to.</p>
<p>From the Jiuda Salt Company to the Yongli Company, from the third year of the Republic of China to the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Fan's decades of struggle and effort not only achieved brilliant success in his personal career, but also made China's chemical industry radiate with brilliance because of him. Under his leadership, the Yongli Company set up two factories, one in the north and one in the south. The North Factory was located in Tanggu, Hebei, manufacturing soda ash. The South Factory was located in Xiejiatian, Liuhe, Jiangsu, manufacturing ammonium sulfate. The former is the raw material for paper and glass, and the latter is the main component of artificial fertilizers. These two important products have saved the country's rights and interests for more than ten years. However, just as people were placing greater hopes on him and Yongli, the gunfire of the July 7th Incident rang out.</p>
<p>The gunfire rang out, and the North and South Factories fell into the hands of the enemy one after another. The persevering and extraordinary Mr. Fan led his subordinates to Sichuan. The old was lost, and the new began again. In Wutongqiao, another soda factory was established. Although the scale was not large, it also contributed a lot during the Anti-Japanese War. Under poor and simple material conditions, they endured and worked.</p>
<p>Serious Blow</p>
<p>After the victory, just as the Yongli Company could make a big difference, Mr. Fan passed away due to illness last October. This was certainly a major blow, but fortunately, the foundation he laid was quite solid, and his friends and subordinates had already taken on the burdens he left behind.</p>
<p>What is the situation of the Yongli Company now? Yesterday, the reporter had the honor of being received by Mr. Li Tifu, the deputy general manager of the company, and had a long conversation in their reception room.</p>
<p>He said that both the North and South Factories have been taken over, and the equipment inside has suffered some losses. The North Factory resumed work in February this year, and the daily output of soda ash is about 90 tons. The South Factory is still being reorganized, and only a small part of it has resumed work, producing only a small amount of sulfuric acid. Why has the South Factory not been able to fully resume work until now? The main reason is that the source of coke and coal is a problem. Before the war, the South Factory always relied on the Xiaoxing Coal Mine Company in Zaozhuang, Shandong, for supply, but Zaozhuang is now under the control of the Communist Party's army. The company authorities have considered going to other places to buy coal, but transportation is very difficult. Reluctantly, they had to order goods from Canada. The quality of the coal is better than domestic coal, but the price is much more expensive.</p>
<p>Because of this reason, coupled with the high cost of wages and transportation, the current market price of foreign goods is 20% cheaper than their products.</p>
<p>Preparing to Move to Shanghai</p>
<p>However, because not many foreign goods have arrived yet, the sales of their products are still not bad, especially in Shanghai and North China, where demand is stronger. If both the North and South Factories, each with more than 1,000 workers, can return to their normal state, the daily output of soda ash in the North Factory can be increased to 200 tons, and the daily output of ammonium sulfate in the South Factory can also reach 150 tons. In addition, the soda factory in Wutongqiao, Sichuan, which was built during the Anti-Japanese War, is still in production, although it only produces two or three tons per day.</p>
<p>The current persons in charge of Yongli Company are Mr. Hou Debang, Mr. Li Tifu, Mr. Fan Hongchou, and Mr. Yu Xiaoqiu. They are preparing to move the head office to Shanghai and plan to divide the country into five regions - east, south, west, north, and central - and set up branch offices in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places respectively.</p>
<p>"However, all development and planning still depend on three major factors: national stability, smooth transportation, and price stabilization. The government has not shown any support for Yongli, but the National Bank has always provided considerable convenience in terms of capital turnover." This was Mr. Li's last insightful remark to the reporter.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Serve Maids</h3>
<p>— Ink</p>
<p>My wife brought our two children from the interior. After much effort, I asked a friend to find us two rooms. Once settled, she suddenly realized we needed to hire a female domestic helper. This was originally my wife's responsibility, but because she was unfamiliar with the area, I personally stepped in.</p>
<p>At the maid agency in ×× Wei, I found a woman who looked honest and was neatly dressed, appearing to be around thirty years old. I stood facing her in the shop for a full half-hour, going through what she considered a negotiation (no, it wasn't a negotiation, it was her examining me!). The conversation went as follows:</p>
<p>"Where do you live?" she asked.</p>
<p>"×× Street, ×× number," I replied. "How many rooms?"</p>
<p>"Two."</p>
<p>"How many people?"</p>
<p>"Four, including me, my wife, and two children."</p>
<p>"Do you want me to cook?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"How many meals a day?"</p>
<p>"Three."</p>
<p>"What about the dishes?"</p>
<p>"You'll wash them?"</p>
<p>"And the clothes?"</p>
<p>"You'll wash those too!"</p>
<p>"How many times a week do you wipe the floors?"</p>
<p>"Twice!"</p>
<p>"Do I have to wipe both rooms?"</p>
<p>"Of course!"</p>
<p>"That's too much work! The wage must be 90,000 yuan."</p>
<p>"I'll give you 70,000 yuan!"</p>
<p>"No way." After a moment, she asked, "Does your wife like to play mahjong?"</p>
<p>"Yes, she does!" I knew what she was getting at. "She has a table almost every day!"</p>
<p>"That's right! Oh, and sir, I also need meat four times a month, one pound each time!"</p>
<p>"Fine by me."</p>
<p>"Let's go!"</p>
<p>"Just like that? Aren't you bringing your bedding?"</p>
<p>"Bedding? No! Your husband has to make it for me."</p>
<p>I called two rickshaws to take us to my house. I introduced her to my wife. She inspected both rooms, up and down, for a week. Suddenly, she asked, "Where do I sleep?" "This place is too small," my wife said. "You can just sleep on the floor in the living room at night!"</p>
<p>"No way! Sir! I'm not doing it! Please give me the fare back!" I couldn't contain my anger and drove her out the door like chasing a dog. She cursed outside the door.</p>
<h3>Transformation</h3>
<p>— Youfu</p>
<p>The changes over the past eight years have been boundless. Vanity and pleasure have ultimately transformed her.</p>
<p>In the spring and summer of the twenty-seventh year [1938], at the guerrilla base by Gaoyou Lake, I saw her for the first time. She was just nine years old, an underage, innocent, lively, obedient, and clever child. From then on, she was forever etched in my memory.</p>
<p>Because I was busy rushing to the front lines, I didn't have a moment to stay in the rear, so I couldn't inquire about her background. I just kept the image of that adorable child in my mind.</p>
<p>Two months later, I was ordered to return to headquarters for work, which gave me another chance to see her. This time, I got to know her. It turned out she was the younger sister of one of our female comrades. I solemnly told her, "You are an extremely lovable child. You must work hard! Your future potential is limitless." I used these words to encourage her. I thought this child's thinking was too advanced; she would definitely become a remarkable person in the future. At the same time, I advised her sister in a very sincere and friendly tone, "You must devote all your energy to cultivating this only little sister!"</p>
<p>My heart was filled with poetic dreams. I hoped she would become a prodigy in the world. While these thoughts still lingered in my memory, another two years passed like lightning. For two years, she remained unchanged, always moving forward. In the early summer of the twenty-ninth year [1940], I left northern Jiangsu to pursue a truth and an ideal. I only saw her once before leaving in a hurry. I only said one sentence: "Seize the precious time and bury yourself in hard work!" She looked at me with an expression like a Christian listening to God preaching, leaving me with a final memory.</p>
<p>For five or six years, I raced across the north and south battlefields, traveling through half of China, during marches, battles, encampments, studies, arrests… and in many other spaces and times. I always remembered this good child, and I believed in her. I had this mysterious little angel. During these long years, I only received one letter from her. The letter was very straightforward and honest. She told me she was about to graduate from high school, and I was very happy. I used a very short letter to encourage her again. That was in the thirty-third year [1944]. When the overall victory finally came, I was truly ecstatic, like a volcano erupting. I murmured to myself, "I will soon be reunited with this adorable child."</p>
<p>Following the victory and demobilization, I arrived in Nanjing and then transferred to Yangzhou. I immediately inquired about her whereabouts. She was indeed living in Zhaizhou, surrounded by red forces. I really wanted to see her, but I had to pass through the red zone. I didn't dare take that pointless risk. Due to time constraints, I boarded a train to Shanghai. I still missed her.</p>
<p>Three months later, I received a letter from an old friend. The letter said, "Liwei is no longer the same as before. Her ambitions have changed greatly. She has already cohabitated with Deputy Division Commander Ye and has gone to Beijing and then to Wuhan!" I was shocked upon receiving this letter, as if I had fallen from a high building!</p>
<p>Waking up, it was already the dawn of the next day. I was walking in the garden, and I couldn't help but feel emotional at the sight. I quietly thought about the sun and the air. The impression they had given me for eight years had never changed. Only the flowers in the garden had withered and fallen! No wonder people have changed too!</p>
<p>I remember the first time I saw her, she was a nine-year-old child, with a vast and sacred future. Unexpectedly, in the last five years of the war, she changed! Her friends told me, "She has two views on life. One is to work hard and strive for the future, and the other is to be extravagant and enjoy pleasure to the fullest. Now, she has ultimately embarked on the latter path."</p>
<h3>"Therefore"</h3>
<p>— Shanshi</p>
<p>Middle school students often misuse function words when writing classical Chinese. One student repeatedly misused the word "而" (er, "therefore"), and his Chinese teacher became increasingly annoyed. So, he added the following comment at the end of the essay:</p>
<p>"Where 'er' should be used, it is not used; where 'er' should not be used, it is used. From now on, it is finished!"</p>
<p>"Are there any houses for rent here?"</p>
<p>"Yes, there are. Do you have a note from your neighborhood association?"</p>
<h3>Crows Are Black the World Over</h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>Crows are black the world over, but the color of Hong Kong landlords is a bit different. People who haven't lived in Hong Kong can't imagine the methods Hong Kong landlords use to oppress tenants. Previously, with legal priority to protect them, landlords were demons to tenants. Later, when the government announced the rent increase and eviction ordinance, tenants could breathe a little easier legally. However, other forms of oppression did not ease up. People living in Hong Kong, unless they owned property themselves, had to swallow a lot of anger.</p>
<p>Now that the eviction ordinance hasn't been abolished by the government, tenants can still use it as their only protection. However, if a landlord wants to take back a certain apartment to rent to someone else, the existing tenant of that apartment becomes uneasy. First, the landlord deliberately creates a legal basis, not coming to collect rent and refusing to accept it even when it's delivered to their doorstep. Secondly, they ignore the water bill. When the water bill arrives in the landlord's hands, they disregard it, delaying payment and allowing the water authorities to cut off the water supply. In addition, they give tenants a lot of trouble, actively and passively using various methods to make the tenant of that apartment unable to bear it and give up their right to live there.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is experiencing a housing shortage, and the housing problem is quite serious. This is because a lot of housing was destroyed during the war, the number of people returning from the mainland has increased, and recently, people coming south from Shanghai have been like carp crossing the river. This has created the basic phenomenon of a housing shortage. The housing shortage directly gives landlords a golden opportunity. They repair damaged buildings, and after the repairs, they rent them out, on the condition that the tenant compensates the landlord for the building's repair costs of several thousand yuan. The rent is then increased five or even ten times compared to before the war. Landlords use the above-mentioned methods to force existing tenants to move out of well-maintained buildings, then rent them to new tenants, on the condition of a transfer fee of several thousand yuan (about 5,000 yuan). The newly set rent value is then doubled or even tripled.</p>
<p>Landlords are so rampant because there are people helping them do evil, profiting from the chaos. The rent dispute mediation office can't handle it. It's not that they can't handle it, but rather that legal persistence requires witnesses or material evidence. The loser often suffers from insufficient evidence, while the landlord has another "pocket" full of money.</p>
<p>Therefore, the landlord's ferocity and their coldness and arrogance toward tenants are initially due to the legal protection they had in the past. There are too many poor people in Hong Kong, with those who have to rent housing accounting for more than 95% of the total population. Too few of these 95% of tenants understand the law, and too many are willing to submit to the landlord's exploitation. This "willingness" is explained by themselves as not wanting to cause trouble, but others are causing trouble on their heads. I believe this is the biggest factor in fostering the landlord's ferocity. However, it's hard to blame them for not wanting to "cause trouble" because most landlords are Justices of the Peace. Justices of the Peace are very powerful in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong society has a very different character from other places.</p>
<p>Hong Kong landlords are extremely privileged. Several of them are even figures who have a page in Hong Kong's history. How could a tenant dare to confront them, lest they be crushed to pieces? However, the pre-war rent increase and eviction ordinance may have played too much of a joke on them, and many landlords are very dissatisfied with this. However, on the tenant side, they hope the government will announce a more democratic "law" on the housing issue.</p>
<h3>The Voice of Shanghai – The Reborn Shanghai Municipal Symphony Orchestra</h3>
<p>— Xiyan</p>
<p>Music is a major event in civilized countries.</p>
<p>After the victory, Shanghai has had grand performances; but the municipal orchestra, as Shanghai's only symphony orchestra, has only recently completed its reorganization and rebirth.</p>
<p>Money, the focus of all problems, the municipal orchestra had ample funding during the time of the Public Works Department [工部局], thus the achievements were not small. But when this orchestra was reorganized into the municipal symphony orchestra, there was a period of financial constraints. The musicians' livelihoods could not be maintained. They did not have the energy to practice, and it was difficult to perform well. After all, to make music, one must first have a stable life. Unlike writing, which can improve with poverty. Now, the funding problem has temporarily come to an end. Mayor Wu has agreed to allocate 20 million yuan per month as funding, with each musician's salary being 300,000 yuan per month. In this way, their lives are slightly more stable, and they can concentrate on art. They regularly practice at Yi Garden [逸園] from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM every Tuesday and Friday, and hold public performances from 8:30 PM to 10:30 PM every Wednesday and Saturday. Ticket prices are divided into three tiers: 2,000 yuan (standard), 3,000 yuan (middle row), and 4,000 yuan (reserved). According to Xu Jinqing [許錦淸], the new director of the orchestra, in order to popularize music, they hope that civil servants and students will attend the orchestra's practice sessions every Tuesday and Friday, which is completely free.</p>
<p>The predecessor of this orchestra was the Public Works Department Orchestra, so the existing foreign foundation was established for us by them. Although it has been crowned with the name of the Shanghai Municipal Symphony Orchestra, when you look at the 54 performers, 46 are foreigners. It really makes us ashamed! However, the number of Chinese people has increased now. In the past, there were only three Chinese people in the Public Works Department Orchestra, such as Ma Sicong [馬思宏] and Chen Youxin [陳又新], which is shameful to say! Now, there are two first violinists, three second violinists, two violists, and one trumpeter who are all Chinese. According to Director Xu, there is also a foreign flutist who will come to Shanghai from Chongqing to join the orchestra. Mr. Xu, speaking English with a French accent, also said: "We hope there will be more Chinese people in this symphony orchestra!"</p>
<p>The conductor of the former Public Works Department Orchestra was originally the Italian Pacy. Shanghai audiences are very familiar with him. His conducting style of separating his hands to make different beats has long been praised by many. But now he has left the orchestra for some reason. The current conductor is Mr. Sloursky, a Russian, who is also experienced and cultivated. His advantage is that he doesn't make unnecessary flourishes to distract the audience.</p>
<p>I listened to their eighth performance. Many of the pieces were very common and well-known works, with no symphonies. I think it was for business reasons. However, for the Shanghai audience, I think it's excusable to temporarily avoid too many serious programs and slightly consider the audience's interests. One thing I feel is that the equipment on the stage at Yi Garden probably causes a lot of loss in sound volume. Open-air venues often cause the sound volume of smaller orchestras to dissipate, especially when there are violin and cello solos. The sound simply becomes very weak. These words may all be "pretentious expertise," and I don't know if they are correct.</p>

<h3>Writing Seal Script</h3>
<p>— Gao Tianxin</p>
<p>Engraving seals must first involve writing seal script, to understand the brush techniques and character structure of the seal script style. Zhao Fanfu [趙凡夫] of ancient times said, "If modern people can't write seal script, how can they have good seals?" This is indeed a true statement. Ye Erkai [葉爾鎧] also said, "The value of a seal lies in the text. If you don't delve into the seal script and instead focus on the knife work, you are deceived." The difference between a seal artist and a craftsman lies in the different seal script styles.</p>
<p>To write seal script, first practice the Mt. Yi Stele [嶧山碑] (published by Zhengshu Bureau [正書局]) and the Mt. Tai Inscription [泰山刻石] (published by the Yiyuan Zhenshang Society [藝苑真賞社]) to achieve strong and vigorous strokes. Next, write the Stone Drum Inscriptions [石鼓文] (published in collotype by Zhengshu Bureau and Zhonghua Book Company [中華書局]) to seek beautiful structures. Then, copy bell, ding, and yi vessel rubbings to obtain their charm.</p>
<p>Among the best rubbings of bell and ding inscriptions, the Sanshi Pan [散氏盤] is the best. Guangyizhou Shuangji [廣藝舟雙楫] commented: "For ancient simplicity, there is the San Gong Shan [三公山]; for exquisite beauty, there are the stele headings; for magnificent grandeur, there is the Tianfa Shenzhen [天發神讖]; for elegant strength, there are the Fengchan Guoshan [封禪國山]; for dense vigor, there are the Shaoshi [少室] and Kaimu [開母]. These are all rare treasures." (Seal text: Feng Yuxiang's Bowl [馮玉祥之鉢])</p>
