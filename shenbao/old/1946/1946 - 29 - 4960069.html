<h3>調處工作可進入坦途　恢復交通在談商中　晉察綏冀衝突已停止</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕調處部今後之軍事衝突調處工作，似可進入坦途，而逐漸進入恢復交通會商階段。在外交·內政備極錯綜複雜之赤峯問題上，政府曾作重大讓步，三方協議於昨日深夜成立，並立即發表第五號公報，否認曾令杜聿明將軍進佔赤峯，並聲明執行部命令國軍及共軍各級將領遵行停戰命令，停留於三十五年一月十三日午夜前之地點，且曾令任何一方軍隊不得進駐赤峯以接收蘇軍或將撤退後之防地，此項公吿已自二十七日晨七時起生效。熟悉內幕之官方人士向記者指陳，此爲政府方面力求和平之重大讓步，緣中蘇曾議定北緯二十八度以北中國地區，蘇軍於受降完畢撇退後，由國民政府軍隊接防，故國軍前往接防，實屬正當之舉，若以停戰辦法而論，則蘇軍二十三日始行撤退，十三日午夜以前共軍旣未佔有赤峯，則國軍於蘇軍撇退後實行進駐，更無不合，但政府力求和平實現，乃作重大讓步，同意不令國軍進駐，共方對該處情形之解釋則謂，共黨早在抗戰期，已於該處進行地下活動，勝利後並建立地方政權及軍隊，如國軍遵守停戰命令，則不立進駐該城，幸者此事已因三方協議，兩軍皆不進駐該城，而獲解決。但現駐該城之保安隊究屬中立方面或中共方面及可否繼續留駐，將爲一値得注意問題，以記者所獲消息，調處執行部在近二三日內已積極進行恢復交通問題之商對，惟談商似無大進展。交通當局今日向記者表示，舉凡有關恢復交通之經費，器材，人工等，俱已準備齊備，僅待中共之同意。言之頗有「萬事齊備只欠東風」之概。並吿記者，安陽。包頭等地負責搶修人員，曾請求共軍允許開始修路，共軍以尙未奉到命令爲辭，執行部中共方人士則認爲，恢復交通實施包括器材人員護路等極複雜之問題，亟需長時商討，並具體說明其願望爲「鐵路中立化」，一般判斷，欲迅速恢復交通，不僅需美方人員調處，且需美方技術人員參加其事</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平二十八日電〕軍事調處執行部派出小組，分赴各處執行停戰令，已吿一段落，今日開始處理第二件候復交通問題。三委員會同參謀人員，夜以繼日在協和醫院總部所在地討論着手辦法。共黨方面主張，恢復交通應包括鐵路，河道，公路，郵電等全部交通。中央方面則謂，全部交通固應及早開放，但鐵路運輸最感需要，故應最先予以恢復。此種爭執，去年秋間在重慶談判時即已發生，今仍未解決。共然方面並要求，交通綫一經恢復，應保證其不作助成戰事之用，足見彼此猜疑尙未完全消除。調處執行部所當處理之第三件事即解除日軍武裝問題，雙方同意暫不進行。膠濟路日軍一千二百人。暫准其繼續携帶槍械械。</p>
<p>〔合衆社熱河赤峯飛機場二十八日電〕美海軍飛行人員，本日下午携帶軍事調處執行總部命令及供應物，與在赤峰勾留已歷十日之三人監導團發生接觸。彼等駕駛之美國運輸機兩架，載有共軍司令段蘇源（譯音）自熱河共軍大本營承德，飛抵此間飛機塲，段氏携有命令，着赤峯區內共軍對於監導團或執行連絡工作之美人准予自由通行，不得留難。</p>

<p>（三）雙方互派聯絡官，此事已在進行中。</p>
<p>（四）雙方徒手士兵可自由進入對方佔領區內，此項行動業已開始</p>

<h3>安全會初次受試騐　昨日會議空氣緊張　伊代表陳辭要求限令蘇軍撤退　伊申訴案決定延至明日再討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據倫敦廿八日廣播稱：整個聯合國機構之基石安全理事會，今日下午而臨是否能　任國際仲裁者之第一次主要試騐。該會己正式准許伊朗陳述其對蘇聯之申訴，當時空氣緊張，公衆旁聽屋內人山人海。開會後，首先討論阿爾巴尼亞請求加入聯合國問題，達一小時之久，最後議決將阿爾巴尼亞之申請加入議程內。旋蘇聯首席代表發言，主張立即討論伊朗問題，但大會決延期至星期三再行討論。安全會主席梅金提議，在討論伊朗申訴時，應准許伊代表參加安全會會議，並訽各代表是否反對此項建議，是時各代表均注目蘇聯首席代表維辛斯基。各代表旣未提出反對，伊代表泰奎柴達即入座，距維辛斯基僅六英尺。伊代表稱：伊政府曾數次以牒文致蘇政府，請求准許伊軍開入亞塞爾拜然，但蘇政府旣未否認亦未作答。伊代表　稱，比次糾紛殊屬遺憾，蓋伊朗原係蘇之盟國，而蘇聯之勝利，伊朗亦與有功焉，最後伊前總理哈基米擬赴莫斯科，亦遭拒絕，於是伊方乃祇得向安全會提出申訴云。伊代表並指陳蘇聯干預伊內政，違反德黑蘭協定，並提出警吿謂，伊朗若不能在其國內自由運兵，則或有悲慘之後果。至是伊代表要求蘇軍在三月二日前退出伊境，並請求安全會通過此項要求。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿八日電〕聯合國機構安全理事會今日舉行第二期會議，討論蘇聯干涉伊朗及英國駐兵希臘東印度等「威脅世界和平」問題。阿爾巴尼亞申請入會一事亦將提出討論，稍後並將討論難民問題，此與聯合國善後救濟總署財政問題之初步討論有聯帶關係。此外，聯合國大會曾接紐約寄來備忘錄一件，文長一萬字，指　阿根廷政府仍爲獨裁政體，以侵略爲目的，並破壞聯合國憲章所規定之一切義務，主張摒棄阿根廷於聯合國機構之外。因此，阿根廷申請入會一事，在本屆會議中未必提出討論。大會議程行將結束，各項要案中尙未討論者爲選舉聯合國機構秘書長及國際法庭法官十五人等。就會議經過情形而論，各小國之遭遇較預料爲佳，其間阿拉伯聯盟及多數拉丁美洲國家曾領導爲小國利益奮鬥，多數小國初恐五强旣在安全理事會中取得操縱地位，在大會中亦將獲得同樣權力，因乃竭力奮鬥，一致堅特大會投票須由多數表決，以削弱大國在會議中之地位，此舉集已如願以償。</p>
<h3>四强着手起草　對義大利和約　法南奧三國要求修正疆界　蘇聯爭取的黎波里托治權</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕紐約泰晤士報特派員稱，據悉，各國外交部代表，方在此起草義大利和約之草案，英代表曾有設立義大利殖民地託治計劃提出，建議將義大利之殖民地，暫時交起草和約之四强即英法美蘇保管，以待聯合國機構整個託治計劃之完成。四强代表以去秋外長會議留有懸案甚多，現正忙於整理，故英國之建議，一時猶無暇考慮。加以蘇聯主張在的黎波利丹尼亞取得單獨之託治權，蘇代表古賽大正在等待莫斯科之訓令，在未曾接獲以前，當無從討論此項託治問題。過去一二星期中，英美兩國曾有對菲洲殖民地及太平洋島嶼，取得一國託治權之要求。故蘇聯自不甘落後，擬對的黎波利丹尼亞主張相同之權利。蘇聯對於都特卡尼西羣島尙未表示意見，此乃各方所迫切期待之問題。據悉，蘇聯且復支持南斯拉夫對特里埃斯特港之要求。此外尙有賠款問題，英美法認爲義大利旣不應亦無力負担賠款，法國對於義大利之要求，似己較去秋外長會議時爲減少，法人仍要求取得義邊界之勃里迦及丹達，惟己不復索取義國西北部之伐爾道斯達及里比亞南部却特湖附近之地，主張取得義國土地最力者乃戴高樂，戴氏之去職，當使法國之態度趨向緩和。</p>
<h3>羅保問題　英蘇獲諒解</h3>

<h3>英蘇兩國關係　呈反常狀態　英國予蘇之安全讓步　竟不能獲相對的報償</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十八日電〕紐約泰晤士報特派員稱：英國外相在國際會議席時，坐於蘇聯人民外交副委員長之側，竟稱，對蘇聯政府之指責，業已感覺厭倦，可見英蘇兩國關係，或英國之傳統外交政策，業已發生若十意外事件。同時英國各報以「政治欺騙」「亳無信用之行爲」「惡意的無聊行動」等名辭，形容蘇聯之宣傳及外交政策，亦可表示兩國關係之反常狀能。英人確已感覺厭倦，彼等覺蘇聯所要求之特權，乃蘇聯本身所不願讓與他人者，治英國所給與蘇聯之安全讓步，竟不能獲得相對之給付。蘇聯對於波羅的海諸國，波蘭·芬蘭·東普魯士·捷克·羅馬尼亞·保加利亞諸國之要求，英國均未表示反對，然當英國主張與西歐諸國保持更密切之關係，或在南歐或中東實行其安全政策時，莫斯科即表示堅決之反對。英人覺其所面臨之局勢如下：具有四干五百萬人口之英國，竟被具有兩萬萬人口及世界最龐大陸軍之蘇聯，要求承認其與鄰邦政府訂立之盟約，以爲安全之措置，而英國除倚賴聯合國機稱外，反不許有其他之安全佈置。在此種情形下，英國所可能採取之途徑有四：（一）信任蘇聯之好意，任其所爲；（二）恢復均勢政策，不容歐洲大陸僅有一强存在；（三）倚賴聯合國機構；（四）改良聯合國憲章。使諸强或則服從聯合國法律之束縛，或則與各國之聯合力量對抗，此外復以西歐地區協定，作聯合國機構之後盾。就目前形勢　，任何英國政府當不敢信任蘇聯之一腔善意，同時英國或聯合國機構，亦不數對某一强國之侵略，採取若何行動。蓋英政府　懼蘇聯，而對於英國尙未能確定其用憲，故英國之外交政策，以採取前述第四條途徑最爲可能。眞正之均勢政策，乃爲聯合諸國向好戰之國家採取一致行動，出席聯大各國代表預料當和平條約簽訂後，國際間之不定局勢可望稍安，而英蘇兩國之關係或可轉好。</p>
<h3>英前閣員　指責工黨政府</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二十七日電〕英國前保守黨閣員麥克密倫，今日指責工黨政府稱：在工黨領導之下，英國與蘇聯友好關係已逐漸减退，即與美國亦遠不似往日之親密。以前據稱工黨執政後，英蘇關係，可立即改善，但時至今日，吾人與舊盟友之友好關係，巳受嚴重威脅云。</p>
<h3>英美商業航空成立互惠協定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社首墓大島漢彌兩敦廿八日電〕英美兩國討論互惠商業航空權利問題歷兩星期，聞已於今日成立協定。衆信美國或將與其他各國成立性質相同之協定。</p>
<h3>向印度議會魏菲爾致辭</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿八日電〕印督魏菲爾勳爵今日向印度中央議會發表歷來最短之總督訓辭，謂英國政府具有決心，務必成立由各政治領袖組成之行政委員會，並儘速組織制憲機關。余目前不能詳談此等機構組織之辦法，亦不能說明如何可以克服種種困難，同時亦未便確定印度獲得自由之日期。余僅能向諸君擔保，此等事件當爲倫敦及新德里政府首先進行之事項。印督復謂，諸君之中或有願意投票反對政府之措施者，此事之行否，當由諸君自爲決定。但余覺立法乃印度人民全體之利益，如有阻止或遲延之者，實爲近視政策。</p>
<h3>倫敦民衆大會　要求准印度獨立　並同情東印越南解放鬥爭　會後列隊遊行向政府請願</h3>
<p>〔路透肚倫敦二十八日電〕印度聯盟昨在此問特拉法爾加廣塲舉行反對英國在印度及印度尼西亞施策之示威大會，參加者逾二千人，警察特在各要點佈置崗位，嚴密戒備。納爾遜紀念像之四週遍插大會黨國旗，演說者即於紀念像基之上發言，孟哲斯特議員　金遜首先發表演說，謂諸君乃倫敦之代表，此一機會可以表示對爪哇·越南·及印度之獨立運動，具有深刻之同情，會塲裝有擴音機，印度婦女之彩色服裝，爲大會美麗之點綴。</p>
<p>會塲圖柱懸有豆幅「收穫完全之勝果」之標語。威爾斯議員柯夫之演說，警吿政府準備應付孟買開槍案之反響，其言有謂，工黨政府雖爲余所擁戴，但如繼續施行帝國主義政策，當不得不使用帝國主義之方法，余誠不願見工黨政府走入此一途徑。時會塲情緒已漸趨緊張，柯夫乃謂，諸君應擁護此一任務，請議員諸公保護東方人民之自由。印度共黨候選人杜特亦謂，吾人在此開會，不僅爲印度·印度尼西亞及越南人民之利益，同時亦爲諸君之利益，吾人當不能令我國之　人參加干涉其他民族自由奮鬥之行動。大會通過兩項決議，即要求印度之獨立及要求英政府承認印度尼西亞之獨立。羣衆於會後列隊遊行，循政府大厦至外交部與印度事務部提出決議書，驕警率先保護繼爲高持大會黨旗轍之印度學生。印度聯盟秘書　曼農。及英國會讓員柯夫與赫金生兩人。遊行行列中有少女老婦·身經兩次大戰之老軍人·英三軍官兵·荷蘭水兵·美飛行員以及印度兵三名。於爾會大厦之大鐘鳴四下，行列出發，待領導人入外交部與印務部時，餘者竚立政府大厦前，高呼口號及嘲　之言。行列旋返特拉發爾加廣塲，主席赫金生告羣衆稱：「吾人已遵命將決議書提交印務外交爾部，在外交部中外相員文留言謂　已被邀出外，但將於一小時內取閱決議書而考盧之。印務部中則無負實人在，印度方在水深火熱中，乃辦理印度事務之處，除與印度事務部毫無關係之一人外，他無人在，吾人不得不將決議書留交其人立即轉致印務部長。兩決議書均將獲得考慮與答覆，而覆文將交報紙公佈，或在此間再度舉行公共集會時發表之。吾人旣巳提出決議案，今所舉行之集會，將在印度越南與印度尼西亞爲人民所談及，而知英網人民擁讓彼等求自由之奮鬥」。與會羣衆旋即捐款二千羅比，充印度聯盟經費，以表示彼等對印度目的之實際同情。行列全長四分之一哩，經紀念碑時，所持印度國旗一律斜執，向兩次世界大戰中戰死者致敬，夾道觀衆殊衆。</p>
<h3>日本女律師　主修正民法</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿八日電〕日本十一女律師之一渡邊通子小姐，昨夜發表廣播演說，指　一八九七年制定之日本民法，「充滿封建思想。」渠宣稱：該民法必須加以改訂，俾夫婦得享平等權利。渠稱，日本婦女被列爲准無能力者，一切重要行為均須得其丈夫之許可，妻子無嗣，始可繼承其丈夫之財產。又稱，日本之　婚法，有利于男子而不利于婦女，渠主張任命一委員會，以修訂日本民法，並准許婦女參加該委員會。</p>

<h3>試驗原子彈　各項紀錄及推論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿七日電〕美國陸海軍專家正準備以艦隊爲目標，試騐原子炸彈威力。原子彈迄目前爲止，尙祇使用三枚，第一枚係在新墨西哥州昨初次實騐，其餘二枚即用以攻擊日本之廣島及長崎。各專家由此三次經騐，搜集各方情報，獲得下列各項紀錄或推論。（一）炸彈爆發之一剎那間，最初壓力達每吋數十萬磅，隨之發生　風，速率在每小時五百至一千哩，雖爲時甚暫，其力極猛，蓋速率在每小時七十五哩以上者，即尋常所謂　風。（二）在海面實騐時，將激起波浪，自低至頂高達一百呎。（三）在所謂「火球」之中心，熱力可達華氏一萬萬度。當熱浪由中心向四週散播，熟力自將劇烈降低，但猶有猛烈破壞性。據美國科學家報吿，距離炸彈爆發處一哩附近之人，縱不爲「機械力」所殺，亦將被灼致死或重傷。炸彈爆發時又發生大量輻射，此種似鍾之彼，在廣島及長崎兩地，威力所及，雖表皮似毫未受創，但血球組織已受影響，致血液滲出，流人內臟空隙。美國軍官及科學家以爲在攻擊日本二役中，此種射綫並無多少餘力，蓋炸彈係在空中爆發，射綫消失極速，不致在地面滯留。但據若干科學家推測，設炸彈於接近地面處爆發，如此次所計劃者，則可留下大量放射性物質可與數噸之鐳相當。由於此種威脅，實騐地點附近各島，或處放射性波浪或雲片漂及，故爲愼重計，須將島民撤退，以防意外。廣島長崎若干房屋牆壁雖直接受炸，因壓力完全向下，仍屹立未動，但屋頂及地板則均片片碎裂。對於鋼骨建築物之影響，在長崎獲有若干端倪，蓋該處三菱魚雷工廠，即因壓力而完全瓦解。此次實騐時，艦隊究將如何排列，負實人員未肯洩露，僅稱，若干主力艦將置於炸彈爆處之中心，並將廣佈於極大區域，上載自動紀錄儀器，以研究各種不同程度之損害。</p>
<h3>古盎總統籲請國人　協助政府渡難道關　財政民食為當前兩問題　法國外交政策一仍舊貫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據舊金山二十八日廣播稱：法總統古盎今日發表文吿：　諸法國人民全力協助新成立之法內閣，以便渡過目前難關。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據巴黎二十八日廣播稱：法總統古盎今同報界宣稱「法政府爲改進國內經濟與財政情形起見，決採取極嚴厲之步　，使人民驚醒，但所有一切決定，必依照民主原則。太人目前責任極重，本人就任總統之職，非由　心所推動，而係由責任心所感召，深盼此種責任心必可鼓舞全體法國人民」。</p>
<p>〔本報訊」據巴黎二十八日廣播稱：新任法總統古盎在今日法內閣會議時，宣稱：「法國外交政策，決無變動，此項政策，前已由法外長在聯合國大會中予以宣佈。新政府現遭遇兩種問題，其一為供應，另一則為財政，本人確信：法國人民必能以彼等在其他困難道時期所表現之毅力，接受此種問題」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿七日電〕法國臨時總統古盎今日召集新內閣首次會議，並定於明日向議會宣布施政方針。據稱，法國人民或難免聽到不快消息。今日閣議曾討論食糧。財政及國際問題，古盎主張增稅，平定物價，並减削政府支出，以防止通貨膨脹。</p>

<h3>舉世囑目之　美國會動向</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕美國以至舉世人民均將密切注視美國會對美國向英貸款之處理情形，原因如下：（一）反對方面表現之力量，對於美政府本年度貸款予外國之程序，將有重大影響，此程序現正待對英信用放款批准，以定其前途。（二）由此次辯論情形，可窺見美國會處理事務之行動途徑。（三）由此可證明美國會對杜魯門總統內政計劃之不滿，將否擴　至國會對總統外交關係與國際合作政策之態度。（四）由此可見美國是否迅速投入新的孤立主義。對英放款事，在參衆兩院或將遭遇更危險之重大反對，惟美政府早憶料到，故已擬定應付辦法。</p>
<h3>緬甸要求自治引起美國注意</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕據華盛頓外交界所獲消息：最近在仰光舉行之緬甸反法西斯會議，決議要求緬甸之完全獨立，以代目前之自治領制。此舉已引起美國觀察家之注意。彼等希望今日在仰光舉行之緬甸立法會議，將透露緬甸現政府之意向，而澄淸該國政治局勢。據悉，該最近舉行之會議，亦曾通過決議，譴責解放後緬甸境內盜匪橫行之情形。</p>
<h3>阿爾糾尼亞破獲　反政府陰謀</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿八日電〕蘇聯通訊社今日傳「法西斯恐怖份子，欲推翻阿爾巴尼亞政府，並暗殺其領袖人物之陰謀已被破獲。陰謀主犯亦已在蒂拉那斯科泰利等城就逮。該通訊社又傳阿爾巴尼亞政府公報稱，先是當局在斯科泰利被獲法西斯組織，名曰「阿爾巴尼亞聯合會」，被捕諸人與居住國外之著名罪犯有關係，且　圖與逸往希臘搗亂之阿爾巴尼亞人獲取接觸。被捕者有若干人積極贊助希臘法西斯主義。</p>
<h3>美工潮情勢好轉　罐裝廠工人已於昨日復工　鋼鐵業亦有早日解次徵象</h3>
<p>〔聯合社芝加哥廿七日電〕美國兩大勞工聯合會所屬肉業裝罐工人因要求增加工費實行罷工，政府己於星期六日接管罐裝各廠，現聞星期一日將有工人二十四萬八千名復工，星期三日起可以開始送貨。政府方面今日對其他工潮亦表示樂觀。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕政府要人某於星期日晚預言，鋼鐵業工潮可在一星期內結束。據稱，此消息係自接近主持政府勞工政策之某方面得來，但不能詳細證明。鋼鐵業工潮發生已一星期，內中希望早日解決者自福特。克雷斯勒兩汽車公司工潮解決後，其實力已大爲增强，或可於一星期內得佔優勢，且此外尙有他種壓力，可使之獲得勝利。白宮在三四日內雖不擬干涉，惟此後變化正多，殊屬難料。此次鋼鐵業總罷工，於一月二十日夜半開始，參加工人達八十萬名，徧及三十州一千二百九十二廠，爲美國鋼鐵業歷史上最大之工潮。事前雖經杜魯門總統竭方幹旋，欲使工業組織聯合會與美國鋼鐵公司成立妥協，卒　失敗，僅西海岸鋼鐵廠總理凱塞接受總統提議，允每小時增加工資一角八分半。鋼鐵業工會最初提出要求爲每小時增加工資二角三分，資方僅允增加一角二分半，經一再交涉後，勞方允减至每小時增加一角九分半，資方最多允增一角四分，談判遂於一月十九日破裂，二十日夜半起即實行總罷工。</p>
<h3>閏於修約要求　英至埃覆牒</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十八日電〕路透社外交訪員探悉：英國對於一九四五年十二月二十日埃及就修正英埃條約事所提來牒之覆文，已交予埃及大使，衆信覆文對來牒頗表同情，現正與埃政府籌備同時公佈雙方牒文。消息靈通人士相信，修正條約之日期與方式問題，將由雙方會同檢討之。聞埃及切欲修改蘇丹之地位，並使英軍撤離埃境。一九三六年擬定之英埃條約，僅許英軍於戰時得駐運河區以外，故英軍從埃及大部份區域撤退事，大致可與主要條件問題，分別討論。</p>
<p>〔聯合社開羅廿八日電〕埃及閣員三人，昨因政府當局不將埃及獨立及英軍撤退問題向聯合國大會提出，憤而辭職，茲已打　辭意，埃及政潮因吿平息。</p>
<h3>美國造成　新式轟炸機　速度威力無與倫比</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕海軍方面今日發表一威力强大之新式俯衝魚雷轟炸機，將載於米特威式超級航空母艦，其最遠航程可達千七百哩以上，能以每小時五百餘哩之速率垂直俯衝，用四千磅重之炸彈或火箭或魚雷一枚及二千磅左右之炸彈火箭　擊目標。此新式轟炸機稱爲BTM摩勒式，係由巴爾的　之麥丁公司設計製造，專供新式巨型航空母艦之用。平面飛行速率每小時超過三百五十哩，不裝炸彈時毛重一萬七千五百磅，較現在所用之同式飛機的多一千磅。此機裝有特別制動機，可使垂直俯衝之最高速率每小時五百餘哩，减至每小時三百五十哩以內，因此投彈更能準確。其裝翼俯衝制動機在速率極高時可於五秒鐘內放開，此機裝有世界量大之飛機引擎，具有三千匹馬力，其寇蒂斯四頁電氣推進機，直徑十四呎八吋。此機袁廣五十呎，機身長四十一呎八吋，機翼係箱式構造，外翼片可垂直摺疊，以便於航空母艦之搭載。機上裝有二十八厘口徑砲四尊，所帶炸彈，火箭及魚雷均懸於外面。</p>

<h3>新幾內亞探險史的新展開　美空軍發掘大谷　鬈髮野人別有一種生活相　本報編譯室譯自十二月號美國地理雜誌</h3>
<p>「上校，越過山脊，便可進入轉往隱谷的深峽。」</p>
<p>當我在新幾內亞內地拔海乙萬呎高的山地上空，駕駛C-60星型飛機，作曲綫形飛行偵察時，由對講無綫電話筒中傳來上面這些言語。天空中到處望見　　裹一個一個的窟　。吿訴我上面這些話的，是我的訓駕駛員葛立姆軍曹。</p>
<p>一星期前，他發現了新幾內亞的隱谷，當時他飛來飛去，在橘山的峻嶺叢山間，搜索一條此較低窪的山徑。這所隱谷的存在，一直到一九三八年才由美國自然史學探險團的亞區鮑爾博物院向世人透露。白種人到這一哩高，四壁封閉的深谷來，還是第二次。後來，我們知道亞區鮑爾探險團把它改名爲大谷（Grand　Valley）。</p>
<h3>搜索降落塲　兵士變成探險家</h3>
<p>這一次來探險的，不是美國和荷蘭的科學家，却是美國的丘八。</p>
<p>我們的弟兄們來此，目的在找尋可以對付日軍的飛機降落地點。麥克阿瑟將軍在新幾內亞，開始施行跳島戰術時，我們唯一可以供應他的空軍路綫，便在飛越這長一千五百哩，海島東南端的史丹萊山脈。荷蘭第亞攻佔以後，路徑短得多，可以緊貼着麥克阿瑟將軍的前鋒部隊。</p>
<p>盟國西南太平洋空軍總司令凱尼中將（現任上將），命令部下從茂洛克的空軍基地，開闢一條航綫，到荷蘭第亞去，至少要找到一條中間的直航綫，和兩端降落的地點，以便建築基地後立即付諸實用。葛立姆軍曹被派到那邊去偵察，結果發見兩條可能的路綫。他很熱烈地注視這大谷，以爲它很有作爲隆落塲所的可能性。第一條發現的路綫，在大谷西南面約兩百哩，經過伊菲太明地方，我們於是便出發視察。</p>

<p>大谷拔海一哩高，橫躺在亞區鮑爾所發見一帶雪山中的橋山裏。在這些斷崖削壁中間，却居住着奇異的，與世不相往來的部落民族：他們中問有許多人老死不相交往。大谷的南面入口，被　佔兩百哩的濕地和簡單着　曇的溪峽深鎖着。東西面是高達一萬四千呎的層疊陡峰，無異是它的國牆；僅有的可能入口在北面。雙發動星型飛機機員十四人，天一亮，便從茂洛克起飛，在五百呎的高空中，我們就鑽進了　層，雲的頂點還高在八千呎的天空中。</p>
<h3>人頭被割掉　或做鱷魚的點心</h3>
<p>在茂洛克和橘山山脚的中間一段，我們飛越了廣佔兩百哩的濕地。這片濕地，望下去平坦一如彈子桌。　居在這裏的部落，是專事　取人頭的民族，這些野人，和充斥當地的鰻魚，一樣地可怕。從這裏，我們便可很容易看出爲什麼荷屬的太那茂拉流戍殖民地是世界上管理得最有效的道理了。囚犯們唯一的逃越途徑，是順着河流而下，假如他逃入濕地，那末被割掉頭，還是做　魚的點心，便隨他抉擇好了。</p>
<p>飛近橘山時，雲層越發高了！但瞥見有一處峻崖特別峻削。大谷上空，浮起一片少見的白羊　狀雲堆，我們可以看見一個偶然的罅口，我們知道這裏面潛伏着許多山峰，比較高的峰巔，　　出　層之上。</p>
<h3>本文作者及其獵獲之獮猴</h3>
<p>圖中手持獮猴者，即本文作者艾爾斯摩上校。此猴已由艾氏携返美國，轉贈其女。渠曾屢次飛往大谷上空，去年五月間，美軍運輸機在大谷失事後，渠曾熱心從事援救工作，厥功殊偉。</p>
<h3>飛渡橘山高入雲尖　臨大谷上空</h3>
<p>我們需要飛越橘山，並在谷的北面尋出一條路來。我們的飛機升高至一萬七千呎後，方得安全地穿過或環繞着雲尖飛行。我們看見了高遠一萬五千多呎的威爾海姆山峯，眞奇怪呀，這赤這邊的雪山！</p>
<p>我們盤旋三十分鍗後，方始下降。此間山脈櫛比，峯高自一萬三千呎降至六千呎，很淸楚地在新幾內亞北岸伸展着，每一山脈中間，有一條河道，流過濕地。突然間，葛立姆軍曹手指着一處山脊頂上三百呎高的雲堆，在話筒裹歡呼道：「快滑過那山脊！」於是我們便滑過那山脊，進入一所溪峽，然後又重覆飛在靈層下面，喘過一口氣來。我們的飛機越降低，那溪峽也越發變得狹隘。它四週的削壁，也越見峻險。此時我們兜了一個圓圈，一片筆直的懸巖在對面矗立着，我的呼吸陡然緊張起來。可是，葛立姆又發言了：「那懸巖和雲堆的中間，有空隙，我們繼續往中間飛吧，山谷就在這下面！」</p>
<h3>天然大山洞　奔流着滑洛克河</h3>
<p>當我們飛越那懸巖時，觀察得一個大然大山洞，也可以說是天然的大隧道。它的圓項半徑，至少有三百呎高，在我們飛機下面的滑洛克河，突然在此鑽進了深峽的削壁裏面去啦。</p>
<p>在山脊的那一邊，我們看見土人的村落散佈在溪谷上，一直伸展到幾乎高挿雲霄的削壁上面。在這溪谷住下里許處，那滑洛克河道的流水，又從另一山上湧出，繼續曲折地流向它的前途。雲端裏，倐忽開裂一綫隙縫，這寫話式的大谷，便在此時呈露在我們的眼前。</p>
<h3>大谷的全境　是一片肥田沃壞</h3>
<p>這一帶羣山中間，躺着那奇特的部屬村落，我們全部作一島瞰：大谷面積，縱的方面，全長三十哩，一條名叫巴林的大河，流實其間。巴林河從北端一溪峽起，激流成瀑，流入谷中，其勢便形緩滯，出谷後，便又伸入另一所四週都是峻壁的溪峽，倒懸成爲澎湃的湍流，一直到入海爲止。整個谷土，甚至它四週的削壁，都是肥田沃壞，和新幾內亞其他的部份逈異。</p>
<p>農田四週，交織着水溝，農產物到處都滋長着，男女老幼，一律在田間勤勞地墾種着，這又和其他熱帶地方不同。我們的飛機突然出現，當然使這些人們懼怕，飛機急降時，他們都四散亂奔，有的伏在山芋田裏，有的往水溝裏跳。</p>
<p>有一點覺得很奇怪，大谷內的水溝和村落，都整方排列，比諸美國的農田，不稍遜色，他們所種的田，一直擴展到高挿入雲的懸嚴上，美國農夫決不敢爬得那麼高！土人的房屋全都造在山脚邊，有的選隱約躱在　堆裏。</p>
<h3>土人擲長矛　企圖剌擊偵察機</h3>
<p>每一處村落，築有木石籬笆，到處有一種瞭望塔矗立着。我們飛得很低，想看個仔細，這些塔都用樹木拚紥而成，塔尖有一個哨兵，好似站崗一樣，躱在上面。我們的飛機顯將道瞭望制給搗亂了。這個「哨兵」沒命的往下爬，飛也似的向茅屋內溜，我們又一次低飛時，有一個土人竟用他的長矛往上投擲，想刺擊我們的機身。</p>
<p>河道兩旁，建着一所所村屋。這河這無疑地是戰爭部落的天然防禦綫。我們看不見播樑或船隻。但土人們確知道造橋，後來有一次飛近這深谷的山牆時，終於發現一頂吊橋。</p>
<p>我們這次偵察飛行，對於當地土人情形知道得很少，祇在攝影上得到一些跡象。我們覺得此地的土人，比新幾內亞其他部份所遇見的人高大一些。後來順道作戰時，大谷內六萬居民的情形，才知道得更詳細一些。這次僅在空中見到他們的房屋是圓的，造得和愛斯基麼人的雪屋差不多，有的長圓形。多靠近樹木架屋。</p>
<h3>獲得了資料　向伊菲太明飛去</h3>
<p>此地獲得許多照片和關查資料後，我們便向伊菲太明飛去，找取第二處可能降落的塲所無論在距離上，氣候上，航行上伊菲太明都比大谷適宜，我們於是決定用伊菲太明。同時因爲根據幾年前溪洲某考察　　往調查的結果，認爲那裏的土人很和氣，我們不但要避免流血不幸事件，還　要雇用土人從事建築工作。在我們的荷蘭或澳洲友人那裏，一些也不能得到大谷是否有過白人踪跡的紀錄。從那時起，我便和亞區鮑兩通訊聯絡，對照我們所攝取的相片資料。</p>
<p>凡新來的飛行員，都就地經過標準的訓練，以便適合新幾內亞的氣候與水土。水土和日本鬼子一樣有威脅性，所以飛行員不斷飛到大谷上空去實習。戰地通訊員因此便得到了不少有趣味的冒險故事。我曾駕機送喬琪　脫和哈萊潘脫遜到大谷上空去看過一次，他們替大谷取了一個綽號叫它「上格理拉谷。」</p>
<p>迭次飛行結果，去過那裏的飛行員人數相當多，已足够成立一個訪問組織，許多的戰士回國後，都成爲「上格理拉」協會會員，他們都有飛行日期的證書。</p>
<h3>美機失事　娘子軍同罹慘禍</h3>
<p>有一次訓練飛行時，大谷上空遭遇了一次慘劇。這是五月間的事情，一架軍用運輸機失事，跌落在大谷山牆內，機身全部焚燬，廿四人中，祗有五人未死，其中三個，是在荷蘭第亞基地服務的娘子軍隊隊員，在廿四小時以內，她們中間又死了兩個。此次生還的一女兩男，隨後便將許多大谷內希奇古怪的故事吿訴了全世界。</p>
<p>這次，主持援救工作的，便是作者本人。出乎意外的，許多莫明其妙的當地情形，都獲得了答案。</p>
<h3>三兵士出險　好消息遍傳全美</h3>
<p>失事七星期後，這生還的三名軍人方才遇救出險。我們用降落傘把醫務人員，工程人員，降落在大谷內，從事救濟和建築跑道，以便低飛運輸機安降下去。等到氣候良好的時候，便把一切食糧供應品拋下去，上下對講的通訊隊，接着也下去了，我們還廣播新聞給留在這世外桃源的同胞們傾聽。</p>
<p>這是多麼快樂的一件事啊！當生還的那三位男女同志被救回到荷蘭第亞基地的時候。生還的女同志，名呌瑪格萊脫海斯汀司。是娘子軍中的伍長，她所講述的故事，登遍了整個美國的報章雜誌。</p>
<h3>猪玀肥而大　僅在慶祝時烹用</h3>
<p>猪玀的價値很高貴，殺或吃一頭猪，往往要在慶祝的時候才舉行。所以有些豬，在盛節以前被殺的時候，大多長得又肥又大！圓形的屋頂，都塗滿着煤灰，大谷地形極高，常常需要生火，但是房子上却不見有煙囪，煙都從牆隙裏或屋頂厚茅草裏噴出。男子除了下身一條布遮遮之外，絕無其他長物。女子僅有一撮無花果葉織成的。尿布似的東西，繫在臂部前後兩條肥而又大的大腿，爾面全部露在外面，胸部前一絲不掛。</p>
<p>每所村落，式樣都很整齊，香蕉樹到處可見，田裹種滿着甜山芋。男子大都住在石造的圓屋裏，女子則住在長方形屋子內。</p>

<h3>財產租賃所得稅繳納方式之商權</h3>
<p>— 陶公文</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，上海直接稅局成立，將在本市開征財產租賃所得稅。此稅制尙在草創試行時期，稅法或有缺點，自所難免，茲特提供關於此稅繳納方式之意見，</p>
<p>參者：</p>
<p>繳納所得稅</p>
<p>原則上，固應採取自繳方式，但爲經濟與便利起見，不妨改採扣繳方式。不過扣繳者，本無扣繳租稅之義務，故對於扣繳所得稅者，國家應給予適當之獎勵。若初行存款利息所得稅時，政府曾給予金融業扣繳利息所得稅之甲續費，即以此故。凡改採扣繳方式，須具備兩種條件：第一，必須納稅義務人（所得享受人）之人數，遠較扣繳人（所得支付人）爲多，甚至多出千萬倍。如採扣繳方式，則征收費用及繳稅費用，均可大爲改省。第二，必須扣繳人能單獨根據稅法，計算應扣稅額。如存款</p>
<p>利息所得稅</p>
<p>爲全額定率稅，金融業可根據所得稅法第六條所規定之稅率，及各存戶應得之利息數額，計算應行扣繳之所得稅額，不必等待征收機關之通知，方能扣繳。</p>
<p>吾人試觀現在農地以外財產租賃所得稅，採扣繳方式，已具備上述條件乎？曰：並未具備。第一，財產租賃所得稅之納稅義務人（出租人），遠較扣繳人（承租人）爲少，與存款所得稅之納稅義務人（存款客戶）遠較扣繳人（金融機關）為多，情形適値相反。假定本市有房屋出租人一萬人（包括法人）承租人十萬人，今採取扣繳方式，則征收機關須審查十萬份之所得額報吿書，分發十萬份之應納稅額通知書，同時十萬人須至征收機關代報所得額，十萬人須至國庫，或國庫代理機關繳納稅款。甚至有時緻納二百元之稅款，而扣繳人須支出二百元以上之來往車資，並化費價値數倍於二百元之時間。在此種情形之下，表面上人民所負担之財產租賃所得納爲數不多，而事實上所支出之繳稅費用超越稅額數倍，如採取自繳方式，則前例中，因納稅義務人之人數僅及扣繳人之十分之一，故人民，征收機關，及收款機關化於房屋租賃所得稅之人力及物力，可減少十分之九，僅佔扣繳方式下之十分之一。兩相比較，自繳經濟便利乎？抑扣繳經濟便利乎？凡稍具常識者，當不難判別。</p>
<p>第二，財產</p>
<p>租賃所得稅</p>
<p>由於稅率爲超額累進，及出租二處或二種以上之財產，其所有權屬於一個人者，應合併計算所得額之關係，扣繳人實無法單獨決定應該扣繳之稅額，須俟接到征收機關之通知，方能確定。此與存款利息所得稅截然不同者。且特定承租人每月應付之租金雖同，但應行扣繳之稅額，常因出租人應收租金總額之變動，而大有差異。茲舉例以明之：設出租人一月份有房屋五幢，出租與甲乙丙丁四人，每幢房租六千元，按月給付。依照財產租賃出賣所得稅法第三條第六條及施行細則第十二條之規定，應納財產租賃所得稅一千六百念元，每一承租人扣繳所得稅四百零五元。假定二月初，出租人又買進房屋二幢出租，每月每幢收房租六千元，依法該出租人按月應納租賃所得我二干七百七十元，甲乙丙丁應付之房租，未曾變動，而二月份應扣之所得稅額由四百零五元，增至四百六十一元六負六分六厘六毫。在此種稅額未能由承租人獨自確定之塲合，承租人須接到征收機關通知後，方能扣繳所得稅及給付房租。</p>
<p>抑又有進者，農地以外財產租賃所得稅，採取扣繳方式，由扣繳人報吿納稅義務人之所得額（租金），主管征收機關須費甚大之力量，方能毫無遺漏的將屬於同一納稅義務人之所得，匯總計算。在人名未能單一化，及人民財產統計尙未辦理完善之今日，根據散居各地之各扣繳人之報吿，綜合計算納稅義務人之所得額，事實上，恐甚困難。假定某人住所在上海，在上海有房屋出租，又在重慶，廣州，漢口，靑島，均有房屋出租，如採自繳方式，則由出租人親自報繳，不必經綜合計算之麻煩手續，即能獲得納稅義務人之綜合財產租賃所得額。今採取扣繳方式，由各承租人報吿所得額，設各該承租人均爲高等知識分子，將眞正之出租人塡報，關於該出租人之姓名及住所，毫無錯誤，則亦須由重慶直接稅局，漢口直接稅局，廣州直接稅局及靑島直接稅局接到於該出租人所出租之房屋承租人，報吿之所得額後，轉報上海直接稅局，依法綜合計算該出租人之財產租賃所得額，其手續之麻煩，可見一班。征收租稅之方法，應簡單，便利，經濟，為財政學上之重要原則，今財產租賃所得現有大部分採取扣繳力式，顯與此重要原則似相　背。</p>
<p>由此言之，我人如不欲使財產粗賃所得稅成爲名符其實之良稅則巴，否則關於繳納方式，　應完全採取自繳方式，決不可效存款利息所得稅而採取扣繳方式，蓋客觀條件完全不聞故也。</p>
<h3>得慶生還的娘子軍伍長海斯汀司</h3>
<p>大谷上空失事焚毀的美軍運輸機內，有娘子軍八人，其中五個當塲慘死；廿四小時後，又有兩人喪命。海斯汀司，是八人中最幸運的一個。圖中的海斯汀司女士，滿面愁容，　首仰望着天，盼望祖國的飛機早些來把她救出。好身後的　　，是援救隊內的菲律濱隊員們臨時搭起來的。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>讀兪部長談財政計劃</h3>
<p>財政部部長兪鴻鈞氏日前來滬視察，曾對本報肥者發表談話，謂關於新外滙率問題，業經政府愼重研究，將考慮在振興及發展國際貿易之原則下，擬具妥善辦法，即可公布；對本年度之財政計劃，將側重於建設，而以復員善後爲中心，然本年度財政如整軍等支出，亦相當浩繁，現決設法整頓稅收，一面並擬利用國外物資，同時謀幣制與物價之穩定，俾預算接近平衡；關於省市地方財政問題，必先謀地方財政之充裕，中央決提高對於地方財政補助之數字，同時並擬重行劃分中央財政與地方財政之系列，以明各自之領域。此外，並就簡化直接稅手續。聯合國國際復興開發銀行等有關問題，亦有所闡述。上所云云，雖僅爲對新聞記者的談話，然簡單扼要，已多少明示了國家的財政方針。收復區的人民與中央施政，睽隔已久，河山光復之初，各方進行步驟，未必井然有序，對於他們本身利益有關的各項問題，如貨幣的價値，外滙率的重訂，納稅的負担，接收物資的運用，久望中央負責首長有所宣示。讀兪部長對報人所發表之談話，多少使他們明瞭一點中央對於財政的施政計劃，這於人民對於政府施政的認識上，是不無裨益的。</p>
<p>財政金融的問題是一切問題的癥結。抗戰勝利以來，鬧得最嚴重的，除政治問題外，在實際上還是一個財政經濟問題。近日收復區工潮的此起彼伏，雖然其間原因並不單純，主要也還是個財政經濟問題。在收復區裏的人民今日所感到的嚴重威脅，多半是財政經濟方面還沒有具體辦法，或雖擬有辦法而無即知即行的勇氣來執行。生活指數的提高，物價的騰貴，究其主因，也半由於幣値的未能穩定。因幣値的未能穩定，致影響到一般生活的動蕩。工潮的迭起，主要還是因爲工人工資所得的貨幣，不敷支應他們生活的費用。—這在實質上。多少仍是一個貨幣價値未能穩定的問題，如果貨幣—通貨—的價値還不能穩定下來。則一切社會經濟問題，都可以牽涉到財政問題上去。如果我們不先謀貨幣本身的善後復與，則一切善後復與也恐怕都談不上。這種情形，普遍地出現在經過戰爭後的各國。不僅今天的中國爲然。第一次世界大戰後的法國，德國，奧大利，意大利，都是如此；就是在第二次世界大戰後的各國，情形亦復相同。我國抗戰最久，所受的財政創傷亦最重，茲値戰後復員之際，首先需要善後復興的就是財政金融，而財政金融中首先應謀善後的就是國家所發的通貨，如何使通貨的價值能够穩定下來。必使通貨的價値能够穩定下來，然後社會的不安可以减輕，走上正常的道路，謀社希望，也是今天的財政政策所以最需要有遠見有魄力的人來毅然實施。兪部長對國際金融都市的上海，情形最熟。經過此番悉心考察，敢信必有高明的辦法。但辦法不僅要有「法」，而且必須「辦」，辦法才是可貴。</p>
<p>其次，收復區人民所感到另一脅迫的，是稅收系統的龐雜與稅捐負擔的加提。而其間最大的釁亂是中央與地方財政系統的未能明朗。在地方當局，有認爲中央獨占一切稅源，致使地方財政瀕於破產，故不得不自謀補救之道，於是攤派苛取，案件迭出，而人民與官府則交感其困。至明爲中央系統內之稅捐，其徵收稅率，近且迭有增加，以致收復區八年戰亂之餘，人民不堪負荷，怨聲時聞。收復區人民，望治八年，今河山重光，與民更始，對於財政上之攤派及稅荷，希望有合理之標準，以免擾民。</p>
<p>就國家的立塲，橫置在前之財政問題，主要還是收復區人民希望能做到的幾點。不過，在這以外，有的屬於財政組織上的問題，有的屬於政策上的問題。就組織上的間題來說，財政部的組織，其間有需切實調整之處。例如直接稅之設署，就彷彿像是一件多餘的事。直接稅旣爲國家稅收之一，似應與稅務署合併爲一，以節事功。再則目今的財政問題，旣是一個通貨問題，而關於金融事業的管理，日趨繁複，爲財政部主要業務之一，可是現今僅於部下設一錢幣司，而反無一獨立的單位，如國庫署，稅務署，關務署之類，負責處理，似不足以勝任。財政部之應專設管理貨幣及金融之機構，在今後實已急不容緩。</p>
<p>關於財政的政策問題，則有中央與地方財政之重劃，田賦的改征與糧食部的存廢間題，鹽政關稅等問題。地方財政的沒辦法，據說是所有稅源，多爲中央所占有。上海一市，據說，主要的稅收還是娛樂筵席稅，幾乎是支持市政的惟一稅收。甚至碼頭倉庫等也非市府所能過問，遑論其他？若果此說不虛，這裏顯有極大問題。娛樂筵席稅取諸於一般市民，何以在上海的大工廠大商行，他們得市政的惠特多，而對於市政的擔負却如此輕微？重新劃定中央與地方之財政系統，萬不可忽略租稅上「付稅能力」的原則，務使租稅的擔負能按納稅能力均等地落於一般納稅人的身上。</p>
<p>關於鹽政，引岸包商制度之必須取消，那是天經地義的事。不過，據說，其間辦法亦不一律。長蘆兩淮等地舊商，仍有取得類似變相之引岸制的特權，而兩浙却另行招致新商承包，這不知究爲何故？在對國家的供獻上，各地舊商，彼此多少相同，而在實際上，彼此所得的待遇却大有懸殊。國家變更鹽法，原有權衡，不過變則須澈底，應該明定制度，或則就場徵稅，不問所知，或則不採徵稅制，任人民自由買賣，亦都是辦法。像目下這樣表面上廢除引岸，而實際上仍有類似引岸制度的存在，不特國法不明，抑且破壞整個鹽政規模，影響國計民生，所關匪輕。</p>
<p>凡上所言、乃我們於讀了兪部長談話後的一點感想，願以　諸財政當局，亦不外野人獻曝的意思罷了。</p>

<h3>社會局飭電力工人　限令尅日復工　百貨業怠工圓滿解次</h3>
<p>電力公司工潮，經五大公用事業勞方代表，居中奔走勸解，毫無結果。昨日下午三時，法理斯曾應召至社會局，會晤勞工科長張振遠，對勞方所提十一項要求，表示其私人意見，新局長吳開先氏，為求該風潮立即解決起見，於接事後，即下令該公司職工代表飭尅日復工，並定於今日下午二時召集雙方代表依法進行調解</p>

<h3>「聯總」支配救濟物資　中國所得比較最低　鄭寳南處長報吿工作概况</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午三時，本埠行政院善後救濟總署編譯處，於都城飯店招待記者，並請新近到滬之「行總」美京辦事處處長鄭寳南氏，出席報吿。</p>
<p>救濟物資運往靑島</p>
<p>沈處長先報吿日將派一美軍登陸艦，裝戲大批救濟物資赴靑島。以共重一千噸之麵粉，衣服，藥品，乳粉，等物，分配於山東省內共軍控制區械內之同胞。此次得用登陸艦運輸，係「聯總」署長凱塞向美陸海軍請求之結果，馬歇爾元帥，與魏德邁將軍，均極表同情</p>
<p>我國所得比較最低</p>
<p>沈氏旋即介紹鄭實南氏報吿，略謖「聯總」對我國之協助，為美金五萬六千二百五十萬元，即每一同胞可得美金一元二角五分，以人口平均分配而論，我國所得最低。希望聯總能予調整。鄭氏乃列舉各國所得之數目字，即前為敵國之奧義等國，所得亦較我國為多。分配欠當之原因：第一，或因「聯總」職員歡籍較多，對歐洲國家自不免偏重；第二，因「聯總」懷疑我國吸收此項物資之能力。實則「聯總」如能多多以水陸交通器具協助我國，則吸收與運輸二點，皆可不成問題。鄭氏又稱，彼將於下周赴豫湘等災情最重地區視察。</p>
<p>請求救濟三個原則</p>
<p>繼由沈處長與鄭氏分別答覆各記者提出之詢問，彙誌如下：（一）去年九月十九日，我國於倫敦曾向聯合國善後救濟會議中，要求九萬四千五百萬美元，但因其時決定對前為敵國之德奧等國亦予救濟，表示可以减至八萬萬元，但結果未能如願。（二）各國請求救濟，應依三個原則，即損失之大小，人口之多寡，停戰之情形。歐洲停戰，係逐步而來，英美駐軍於着着前進之際，對駐在國協助甚大。如以義大利而論，曾予以價值五萬萬元以上之救濟。我國因勝利突然而來，從未得到此種利益。（三）各國均有將「聯總」延期結束之意，我國則因戰事結束較歐洲遲三個月，故於明年三月底結束。此事於未來之聯合國救濟會議中可謀決定。中國希望再延長六個月。（四）我國租借英輪運輸救濟物資，國人頗多反對，實則此等船舶，係縣掛聯合國旗，英商只是一種服務。（五）至目前為止，「聯總」物資已來華者達三十一船，約十三萬五千噸，其中二十九船至上海，一船赴靑島，一船赴香港。</p>

<h3>浦拯東報吿　滬市財政收支　四個月來敷二十億</h3>
<p>上海市政府於昨晨九時舉行　國父紀念週，錢市長領導行禮，財政局長浦拯東報告本市收復以來財政情形，繼由錢市長介紹新任社會局長吳開先與市府同人會見。茲誌浦局長報吿大要如次：</p>
<p>滬市收支　向未平衡</p>
<p>略謂滬市財政收支，向未平衡，從前收支不敷時，則發行公債，處分公產，以求平衡。自三十二年中央改定財政收支系統，原屬地方之營業稅，土地稅，財產租賃及出賣所得稅，契稅，印花稅，遺產稅，完全劃歸中央。照現在稅捐屬於地方者，祗有娛樂稅，筵席稅，屠宰稅，營業牌照稅，房捐計五種，此為本市一切行政及建設所需惟一財源。</p>
<p>四個月來　收支數字</p>
<p>合法市稅收入，計去年九月份一個星期收一千六百四十四萬餘元，十月份收一億一千三百六十二萬元，十一月份收二億七千八百七十九萬餘元，十二月份收七億四千二百十餘萬元，本月份至廿四日止收七億一千三百九十餘萬元，共十八億六千四百八十五萬餘元，收數逐月增加，此僅係隨時改進征收方法，並未增加人民負擔。至支出方面，上年九月計五千六百八十七萬元，十月計十億〇七千九百六十五萬元，十一月計十二億七千八百四十二萬元，十二月計十四億九千二百十二萬元，共三十九億〇七百〇七萬餘元。前後收支相抵約計不足二十億〇四千二百二十二萬餘元。中央除撥開辦費及應急費警察冬季服裝費外，上年九月至十二月原屬國家部分預算之行政費生活補助費米代金等，尙未撥到。</p>

<h3>孫票刺激人心　金價逐步向上　美鈔隨金市進退</h3>
<p>烚赤昨因外埠金價報漲，人心復受「孫　」之刺激，業中大戶擬發動軋空局面，一度買風熾烈，惟美鈔實貨傾出，套頭拔開至六四〇元以上，金市有套賣頭寸供給，漲風尙難持久，銀根奇緊，午刻遭浮多殺出而轉微跌，晨開即升為九一萬五，買戶連綿而來，業中人亦聯袂爭購，開後步漲至九六萬左右，此際美鈔行市未見帶俏，遂引起套賣之風，雖有回小，惟中途極多掙扎，近午浮多殺出，午刻缺少銀根下，屈服於九四萬以下，午後現貨交易不多，隔日交割開時曾回升至九五萬三，美鈔續疲，影響人心，最後仍在九四萬五左右，結果與上週六相較，現貨漲三萬八，銀樓飾金掛高至十萬零二，紋銀八五〇元，銀元升為五三〇元，暗拆自一角至一角四分。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔實貨源源殺出，戶在現鈔能否作結款用途之疑問下，裹足不前，晨開受金市刺激，升為一四六〇元，初尙盤旋，後受金市劇漲關係，引起套買（對黃金套價拔開至六四五元對十兩），步升至一四八〇元光景，人後金價回跌，午刻亦隨降至一四六〇元略强，午後續見小挫，實貨由錢兌業方面供過於求，結果較上週六好起十五元，港票初時受金市刺激，新老貨一致稍高，惟老貨因少投機性，較新貨未免遜色，但結果高價不能持久，與上週六相較新老均平。</p>
<h3>大戶施展做手公債又見漲風</h3>
<p>公債自經上週六業中逢低吸收後，已露待機而動之象，昨日報載「孫票」即將發行之訊，遂儘量利用，盡力哄抬，半眞半假狀態下，晨開丙種跌至一六五〇元，大戶連袂購買，軋空及做手雙管齊下，喊價竟一氣呵成，狂抬至一九五〇元以上，多頭遂滿意而止，再來一番脫手及放空，雙重壓力，一轉瞬慘跌四百餘元，退至一五〇〇元，此後出入紛繁，大戶及散戶觀感不一，先盤升至一八〇〇以上，午刻又迫於時間，降至一七〇〇元以內，結果較上週六計甲乙各升三一〇元，丙種三七〇元，丁種升三三〇元，戊種三七〇元。</p>
<h3>投機利用傳言華股節節進展</h3>
<p>華股在偽幣資本尙未全部整理之前，報載又有「孫票」行將發行之訊，不問消息來源如何，投機幫得此儘够利用，永紗晨開即抬高至一八〇〇元以上，美亞一二四〇〇元，但此際因風聲緊急，喊價時斷時續，入後銀根緊迫，　中復有一部脫收購金，準備結賬者，略有回跌，但中途多盤，永紗美亞均自高峯回小一百元光景，直至午收尙不脫盤旋，結果較上週六永紗美亞各漲一三〇元，信和中紡各好三十元，三小熱各漲一成左右，冷門各股亦因底價便宜，受人問津，續有進展。</p>
<p>外股受股債之刺激，被動而升，是以不若股債之燦爛，但過程則極端穩定，並無多大回風，直至午收較上週六計怡紗紙業等中小型各升二百餘元，會德豐以價巨成本較高，未能向榮，橡皮股則寥落。</p>
<h3>紗價又飛漲　紡建年內不拋售</h3>
<p>昨日紗市突飛猛進，　報章所露孫票傳說，入心為之大振，同行及散戶相繼狂吸，在各廠現貨奇缺之情况下，價乃靑雲直上，十六支二十支紗漲五萬，細紗升七八萬，午刻紡建公司宣佈年內不再開售，是以走勢益見挺秀</p>
<h3>配給原料太少　綢一致騰貴</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲塲外交易，一二〇號天橋現貨做價最高一百二十三萬元，最低一百二十萬元，棧單八十萬至八十一萬元，較週末漲起八九萬元，實因第一次配給原料數目太小，各廠不數應用，實銷尙有之故，廠經靜極思動，到貨成本激增，各檔一致提高，中級另担需價一百五十餘萬元，綢貨去路不寂，售價亦然跟進，美亞被面每百條八十五萬元，大誠格璧縐每碼二千八百元，民生織錦緞每件一萬二千元。</p>
<h3>棉花交易堅穩</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市况尙堅，華商紗廠進四十二支原料美棉米得林花價六萬二千元，又三十二支原料三餘鎭細絨花價六萬三千五百元，以上均送廠價，花號進十六支原料火機花價四萬四千元，又周浦籽花開價九千元及九千二百元，以上均棧交價。</p>
<h3>棉布商矜持不放</h3>
<p>孫票發行消息駡傳於市，金價報漲於前，執貨者均存重貨輕幣之成見，矜持不放，益以成品存底籌碼稀薄，布市逎有冉冉上升之象。</p>
<h3>米糧猛漲　食油上升最劇</h3>
<p>米市以陰雨關係，且值歲暮，到源漸稀，店方因休市在即，均須備貨，故實消甚殷，致粳秈米均漲三四百元，麵粉亦因來貨稀少，零消轉暢，再漲三四百元，黃豆異常俏俐，續升五六百元，油市亦以年關店方備貨極衆，狂漲六七千元之巨，豆餅隨之跟漲一二百元，酒市堅穩。</p>
<p>米市塲明起休業　據米糧臨時市塲負責人聲稱，該市塲以年關已近，將於今日工作完畢后，須待農歷明春新正初五再行開始交易云。</p>
<h3>總結賬期將屆　茶市交易轉减</h3>
<p>民國三十四年度，工商各業總結賬期，轉瞬即屆，茶葉同業，亦須循例辦理一年來之營業賬目，是以賣買雙方，皆無意授受，惟間有成交者，亦係零星散戶需用現款者，藉資調節而已，乃交易寥寥無幾，市勢頗為平靜，行情缺乏顯著變動，依然呈穩定狀態，頃據天津帮消息，對於大方綠茶等，需求甚亟，大勢俟渡過農歷新年後，再行活動。</p>
<h3>煤市沉寂　柴炭歲莫非步軟</h3>
<p>煤市交易零　均寂，蓋時近歲尾，大部份煤商暫吿結束，且若無實銷去路，大多無意進貨，白煤塊實銷淸淡，行情續跌，白煤屑鋻於煤球暢銷，股實同業納胃甚　，行情反見挺俏，柴炭零星小販，因雨未能暢銷，而貨主急欲求現返鄕，祇可廉價脫售，但受主尙缺。</p>
<h3>木材市價挺俏　十一月漲一倍</h3>
<p>昨木材市况，雖歲尾年關，仍挺秀俏利，柳安夾板及松板搜羅有人，價迭創新紀錄，　十一月份已漲一倍。</p>

<h3>京臨大收押學生有定明日開審說　王書林聲明未提私訴</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日專電〕臨大被押學生八人，法院有定期三十日開審說，該班主任王書林，京市靑年團書記黃通，曾請求法院提前開審，在押學生已絕食四日，聞此案可望從輕處結。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕京臨大覊押學生，地方法院定三十日開庭審理。</p>
<p>〔本報南京專訊〕首都臨時大學補習班滋事被開除學生，經首都地方法院檢察處，認為有犯罪嫌疑，收押學生于柏靑等八人，業由檢察官偵察完畢，依照刑事訴訟法第一三六條，及三零二條之規定，以妨害公務及自由之條文提起公訴，檢察處職責吿一段落。以後即由法院刑庭推事依法辦理，雖經提起公訴，而有無犯罪之處，待法院開庭審判，目前尙難臆斷。被收押之學生八人，聞訊後即有絕食之表示，因此所謂一二一同學會之一部分同學，於廿五日未上課，代為奔走呼籲，請求釋放被捕同學。法院對此案，即將開庭審判。茲將向各方實際觀察及訪問情形，分誌於下：</p>
<p>學校方面</p>
<p>本報記者二十六日往臨大補習班時，見進門之兩面牆上，張貼被押學生于柏靑等八人之啓事，聲明絕食，籲請同學及社會人士援助。二十五日該班所謂一二一同學會之一部份同學，因此未上課，向外面奔走呼籲者以此。但參觀各敎室，大多數同學，均在上課。該班起初成立時，執其事者，以爲補習班，非常簡單，滿五十人開一班，課程旣屬補習性質，大致規定通常科目即可，不料後來學生人數加多，所有大學各院系科目齋備，為期甚迫，班主任從渝滬及內地羅致許多傑出敎授，（如前科學社著名學者孫洪芬，今適與記者相值，遂知渠担任該班化工系敎授），已煞費苦心。</p>
<p>敎授方面</p>
<p>據該班主任王書林談：前次學生滋事，固由於英文試卷，而最大要求，其來自僞中大學生，欲在此補習之後，一律分發正式中大讀書，坦白的說，如允許他們這種條件，無論如何吃苦將就，都不成問題。此事不但是敎部處理，無此辦法，卽中大本身，因以前校舍只能容二千人，現該　學生已增至四千五百人，已自感困難，亦不能說中大門關得很緊，不許人入，但次不是硬打硬關即可衝進去的。假如學生能在班十分用功，功課很好，此地敎授頗多在中大者，能感覺學生很好，主持公論，也許有挿入機會，我不能將本身不能做到的事，欺騙或敷衍學生，妄許學生　為可入中大，要在其好目為之耳。至於被押學生，他未做原告，未提起私訴，完全是檢察官以學生有妨碍公務及自由，認爲有犯罪嫌疑，由檢察官做原吿，提起公訴。王幷有函致法院，表示對學生寬大原諒，旣未控吿，自不便徇學生之請，用個人名義去保出學生，學生可自已想法，依法申請保釋。</p>
<p>敎部方面</p>
<p>據有關當局談：敎部對整頓學　，為敎育行政上之處理，做到開除學生之手續為止。學生因毆傷班主任被押，開庭審問，是法院法律問題，司法獨立，敎育行政，無權過問。至於要求保釋，自可由學生依法申請，經法院核定。</p>
<p>法院方面</p>
<p>首都地方法院汪院長，聞知被押學生有絕食之訊，特派書記官長涂懷禮，於廿六日上午十一時，往看守所慰問學生，說明汪院長關心靑年之意，此事當循法律軌道進行，卽將開庭　判，勸學生照常飲食，（一說學生並未絕食）幷謂絕食要求，太無意義，法院不負此項責任，亦次無因此稱要挾，可以左右案情之理。談話至二小時之久，學生亦表示看守所長對待靑年尙好之意，聞法院對此案卽將開庭，不日公開審判。照規在王主任有函致法院，表示寬大之意，與院方體念靑年盲從違犯法律之心理觀之，所謂法無可捨，情有可原，臆度審判從輕。大約於本月內二十日左右，即可開庭審判解次。幷聞是日先開一調查庭，先事研究然後三堂會　，（三位審判官同時出庭），以期妥愼周密云。（愚）</p>

<h3>一九四五年十大良藥</h3>
<p>— 慕鳴</p>
<p>像選舉十大電影明星一樣，美國醫學會雜誌，最近特請各大醫師推選一九四五年的十種最重要的藥品，結果很有趣味。</p>
<p>現在先把一九一〇年的十種名藥列舉出來，作一個比較，從此可以見到三十五年來醫學進步的程度。一九一〇年的十大藥品也是由多數醫生所推選，其名位如下：</p>
<p>（一）醚，（二）嗎啡，（三）洋地黃，（四）白喉血淸，（五）牛痘苗，（六）鐵質，（七）奎寧，（八）碘，（九）酒精，（十）水銀。</p>
<p>由此表可見二十世紀初期的醫學家實在還很幼稚，遠不能與今日相比，而那時人類也遠不及我們那樣幸福安全，因為與疾病相鬥爭的武器太薄弱，生命　直沒有保障。</p>
<p>一九四五年十大藥品的皇位被靑黴素配尼西林奪得，這是地致公認，毫無疑問的。配尼西林這偉大的新發明實不愧稱為藥中之王，它對於人類的貢獻太大，醫藥史上從無此先例。磺醓胺類藥品也是光芒萬丈，不可一世，但配尼西靈發明後不免遜色，現在十傑表中把它們並列為一項，因為現代的新藥太多，各具優點，僅舉一種，不免有顧此失彼的遺憾，下面名位表中各項都以一個種類的藥品為單位：</p>
<p>（一）配尼西靈及其類似製品，磺醓胺類藥物。</p>
<p>（二）血液，血漿及血液製品。</p>
<p>（三）奎寧及人造治瘧藥阿的平。</p>
<p>（四）醚及其他麻醉藥；包括嗎啡，可開因，及各種安眠藥。</p>
<p>（五）洋地黃强心劑。</p>
<p>（六）六〇六類砒製劑。</p>
<p>（七）免疫製劑，包括各種疫萬及血淸。</p>
<p>（八）胰島素與肝膏。</p>
<p>（九）其他荷爾蒙（激素）。</p>
<p>（十）維他命。</p>
<p>這個表包括的藥品實在太複雜廣大，其中如免疫製劑，荷爾蒙，維他命都是近代醫學科學史中最燦爛的一頁，決不是僅僅一二種藥品所能代表，要安排出這樣一張表，可說已煞費苦心，但是實際上還有許多藥品雖名落孫山，其價值也是不可忽視的。</p>
<p>血液及其製品居然躍居亞軍，這是出人意外的，大概因戰爭時期輸血的遭遇過多，在應用方面血液的輸量一定很鉅，同樣，癮疾藥受到特別重視也是因爲戰爭多在熱帶地域進行（特別是美國南太平洋的戰爭），瘧疾的威脅遠非昔比。</p>
<p>醫學的突飛猛進，藥物的日新月異，確令人驚奇，試想維他命荷爾蒙這種名詞在一九一〇年時，簡直是聽不到看不見的，如今則已是家喻戶曉，婦孺皆知，預料今後的進步將更加速，十年之後如再選舉十大藥品，不知將有怎樣的變更呢。</p>
<p>節令</p>
<h3>「廢曆」與「費力」</h3>
<p>— 中戈一</p>
<p>儘管你政府頒令廢除農曆，然而「廢曆」還是好端端地存在看，決不會百分之百地被廢掉！當然，在表面上，我們已採用了陽曆，無論機關學校等等無不遵照陽曆辦事，但是陰曆的深入民間早經到了堅不可拔的程度，而絕不是一條政令能把牠從萬民的腦子裹輕易地「廢」去的！試瞧，為甚麼至今人們還是依據廢曆計算他們的生日呢？為甚麼到了廢曆新年，就有陽曆新年所沒有的一種熱閙呢？凡此都是無可諱言的事實。</p>
<p>現在，不是又屆廢曆的新年了嗎？過年了！但是過年是多方面需要錢的；送禮，辦年貨，開銷苦力僕役，給「壓歲錢」……。錢，錢，錢。錢使新年成了一個畏途，一個大難關！不錯，在大老闆方面說，東也是官利，西也有花紅，今日這一個下屬孝敬鷄鴨，明日那一個下屬獻呈火腿，欣賞欣賞「新春巨獻」的好戲，嚐試嚐試數萬元一桌的「犧牲菜」，眞是「不亦樂乎」！但是在小職員，新水階級的一方面呢，是進益微薄得可憐而開支巨大得驚人，在在都使人覺得「捉襟見肘」，而年禮是非送不可，「極場面」也不得不「绷」！於是乎祗能一邊嘆氣，一邊勉强苦笑着去向人說「恭喜發財」！並且年關一屆，「窮人還債此其時也」，誰能跳出債主的手掌呢？好吧，再回過頭來看看物價如何；如何呢？難道你能否認物價是一貫地漲多！跌少嗎？眞所謂「窮人難過大年關」，「王小二過年，一年不如一年」了！</p>
<p>不假，要過一個「廢曆」新年，不由你不說一聲「費力」！———眞正「費力」！的確「費力」！實在「費力」！</p>
<p>要解決「費力」的問題，祇有一個辦法，就是把「廢曆」澈底地，根本地廢除掉！但是，要廢徐「廢曆」？事實上本是一件比過年更「費力」的事！</p>

<h3>重慶點滴</h3>
<p>— 梅幼雲</p>
<p>政協給了我們些什麼？停戰命令是否能促進和平？老百姓的嗓子都喊啞了，人民的希望，並不是想享受什麼舒適的生活。那怕日子再過得艱窘些，祇求能生存在有秩序的有代價的時光中。不要向着滅亡的路上走！</p>
<p>在某一次的政協代表演講會上，聽衆們曾掀動了一次不良好的舉動。他們反對這位代表的論調，竟「動武」了！雖然是無組織的無秩序的舉起了憤怒的拳頭，可是他們口中竟不約而同的喊出了；「蔣主席萬歲！中華民國萬歲！」這證實了正義是無法偽裝的！</p>
<p>留在山城的人們，對這行將來臨的春節，似乎都冷淡了對它的期望。大多數的人在勝利初臨的時候，對它的期望太美滿了，「回鄕度歲」的美夢。旣然無法實現，再加上道些時不愉快的情緒緾繞着，誰還能有那「聽爆竹聲聲，便引上眉梢喜」的過「年」的興趣呢？</p>
<p>中央公園在建築一塊鋼骨水泥的碑。是為紀念有功於抗戰的烈士們的。好吧！讓他矗立在這抗戰勝地的公園裏吧！吿訴這些活着的人們：「你們是為誰死的！」</p>

<h3>功過之間</h3>
<p>— 談自由</p>
<p>這幾天，各地都在審漢奸了。十六日本報有兩段記載；一是在上海審判甘維露，一是在廣州審判陳鴻慈。這兩個寳貝各有各的醜態，同時，更申說自已已往的歷史。他們之所以說出來，歸根結底亦不過是希望大老爺額外開恩：宣吿無罪。</p>
<p>人到世界上來，應為民族，為國家為自己底宗族建立些事業，才不辜負來到世間的這一趟。這不是什麼值得驕傲的東西，這預是本份。像陳鴻慈甘維露之類，看看他們底過去，確屬不壞；但是現在呢？是漢奸。如果能把過去發揚廣大，該多麼的好。可是，他們落了水，造成了千古遺恨，不但汚辱了所有祖先底偉業，更黯淡了子孫底光榮！如今，他們還不肯伏罪，更異想天開地想拿過去的一點歷史，來「折」今日之罪。</p>
<p>兩個人在街頭對駡，我駡你麻皮，你駡我禿頂。雖然，大家所駡的，確都是對方的缺陷；但並不能因說中了對方底缺陷，就說自已底缺陷不是缺陷！說了別人底禿頭，並不能解釋自已底臉不麻！最多不過說，自已沒有這個缺陷。</p>
<p>一個人底以往的功績，我們不應隨便抹煞；但亦不能把這當作他日做壞事，賣國，犯罪的本錢，當作折罪的工具。</p>
<p>功和罪無論如何不能合併，像正負數似地相消。至少功與罪不在同時發生者應該如此。</p>
<p>你賣國了沒有，是審漢奸的目的。有，就得有罪；沒有，把沒有賣國的證據拿來！以往的功過，和今日有什關係？旣做漢奸了，委員長底親筆題贈的照片有什麼用？和什麼人同學又有什麼用？做了十多年的法官更有什麼用？</p>
<p>過去的歷史是有用的，但他祇是給我們做今日的借鏡，是鼓舞我們向上，督促我們為善的工具。有那末好的過去，不好好地發揚光大，已是『罪甚罪甚』了。如今賣了國，還想拿過去來折罪，偏生世界上亦有這種嘴吧來說！</p>
<p>修養</p>
<h3>心靈的眼睛</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>有許多人眼睛並不瞎，然而他的『心靈的眼睛』却是瞎的。因為從他心靈裏透露出來的不是光明，而是黑暗。心靈是一個人身心的主宰，應該時常保特純潔淸淨，如稍稍蒙上一些灰塵，那不啻遮蔽整個「心靈的眼睛』。</p>
<p>一個人的眼睛瞎了，並不是十分可悲的事。愛倫凱女士說：『盲人並不是可以認爲最缺憾的，因為視覺器官的缺陷，能從各方面設法去謀補救。』這話是很對的，近世的科學文明，已經給肓人帶來許多幸福，肓人學校的種種新設施，解決了盲人的閱讀和學習的困難，盲人照常可以閱報，奏樂，接受外界的刺激，喚起生命的動力。世界上有不少盲人，在黑暗中奮鬥成功，我到了人生的光明面。</p>
<p>據近世心理學家的研究，肓人的學習能力，往往超過常人。有人說盲人的智力比普通不盲人高，這並未盡然。何林渥斯說：『肓人的記憶力有時確超越於當人，這是一種補償作用，視覺的缺陷由其他方面來補償。』一般地說，盲人因為失明的原故，不很容易受到外界視覺的紛擾，心總比較靜些，而思想也比較集中，學習能力自然要高得多了。</p>
<p>所以我覺得盲人的眼睛雖然不能看見外蜀的事物，但『心靈的眼睛』或許要明這亮得多。許多盲音樂家，他們能够奏出心之深處的衷曲，而感動無量數的人，或者不是沒有原因吧？</p>
<p>可悲的是社會上有許多人，眼睛不但不盲，而且迎淺度的近視都沒有，目光銳利，眼力很強，但心地却絲毫不光明，思想和行為，都卑劣不堪，腐惡不堪，令人發生『臭水溝裹的渣滓』之感。這種人縱眼睛是光明的，而心地却黑暗無比。腦筋昏沈沈的，思路呆滯得像枯木，一天到晚在胡胡塗塗中混過去，生活對於這般人『心靈的盲人』成為毫無意義的吃飯睡眠一類的事。他們自己也覺得日子過得沒有意思，人生本來是充滿着希望的，他們說沒有希望，只有沮喪與消極，前途本來是光明的，但他們說沒有光明，只有黑暗與沈鬱。其實展開在我們面前的是無限的希望和光明，但是他們的『心靈的眼睛』早已肓了，一塊大翳蒙在上面，自然望不見希望和光明了。</p>
<p>要希望社會進化，文化發展，我們就得使『心靈的眼睛』放出光明來。我們必定要求生活的改進與向上，增進人生對於個體與社會的積極的意義，使我們的生活都成為有目的的，自覺的，把心理上的一切陰翳除掉，不但要保持身體的健康，還要力求心理的健康。革除一切不良的心理。我們的『心靈的眼睛』若看不明白，我們就應立刻設法醫治。</p>
<p>放開我們的眼睛去看外面這個動的世界，要看得遠大些，淸楚些。放開我們『心靈的眼睛』，去思維，體察，認識，批判我們的生活，要從自覺中提高我們生活意義，矯正一切心理上的病態！</p>

<h3>市敎育會成立　敎育工作人員介紹所　學校聘用人員可委託辦理</h3>
<p>上海市敎育會，新近組織「敎育工作人員介紹所」，使中小學合格的失業敎員，都可以謀得位置，安心敎育，這誠然是很重要的舉措。失業是最苦悶而嚴重的問題，尤其敎育界人士，平時在職，待遇菲薄，生活艱苦，家無餘蓄，一旦失業，便有　飱不繼的苦楚。轉輾相託，總不是辦法。現在有了專門介紹敎員的機關，大家可以先去入會登記，可望獲得適當的位置，不致興茫茫前途，無人照顧之歎，另一方面，希望各校常局如需聘請某科，某級，專任或兼任的敎師，訂委託該會介紹所負責推薦。凡資練合格，敎管認眞，任敎有相當經騐的人，就可以聘用，這樣在供求兩方面，都可以得到圓滿的結果。我希望晨·工·商·學·兵·各部門，都有職業介紹所，第一步舉辦人才登記，調查，統計，第二步聯絡各項生產事業機關，儘量多方面推薦，務須做到「人人謀事，各得其事；」「一喇求人，各得其人；」尤望政府倡導於前，社會推行於後，誠能辦理得當，失業問題自可逐漸解決，社會無謂鬥爭，也消弭於無形。「有事大家做，有飯大家吃，」這纔是實行　國父「人盡其才」的主張！</p>

<h3>Conciliation Work Can Enter Smooth Path, Restoration of Transportation Under Discussion, Conflicts in Jin-Cha-Sui-Ji Have Ceased</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The conciliation work on military conflicts by the Conciliation Department seems to be entering a smooth path and gradually entering the stage of consultation on the restoration of transportation. On the extremely complex and intricate issue of Chifeng, involving diplomacy and internal affairs, the government has made significant concessions. A tripartite agreement was established late last night, and the fifth communique was immediately released, denying that General Du Yuming had been ordered to occupy Chifeng. It also declared that the Executive Headquarters ordered all levels of National Army and Communist Army generals to abide by the ceasefire order, remaining at the locations they held before midnight on January 13, 1946. Furthermore, it ordered that neither side's troops should enter Chifeng to take over the defense areas after the Soviet troops' withdrawal. This communique has been in effect since 7:00 AM on the 27th. An official familiar with the inside story pointed out to the reporter that this is a major concession by the government in its efforts to achieve peace. This is because China and the Soviet Union had agreed that in the Chinese territory north of 28 degrees north latitude, after the Soviet troops completed their surrender acceptance and withdrew, the National Government troops would take over the defense. Therefore, it was justified for the National Army to go to take over the defense. According to the ceasefire method, the Soviet troops only began to withdraw on the 23rd. Since the Communist Army had not occupied Chifeng before midnight on the 13th, it was even more appropriate for the National Army to enter after the Soviet troops withdrew. However, the government, in its efforts to achieve peace, made a major concession and agreed not to let the National Army enter. The Communist side's explanation of the situation there was that the Communist Party had been conducting underground activities in that area as early as the War of Resistance, and had established local political power and troops after the victory. If the National Army obeyed the ceasefire order, it would not enter the city. Fortunately, this matter has been resolved due to the tripartite agreement that neither army will enter the city. However, the question of whether the security team currently stationed in the city is neutral or Communist, and whether it can continue to remain stationed, is a noteworthy issue. According to information obtained by the reporter, the Executive Headquarters of the Conciliation Department has been actively discussing the issue of restoring transportation in the past two or three days, but the talks seem to have made little progress. Today, the transportation authorities told reporters that all expenses, equipment, and labor related to the restoration of transportation are fully prepared, awaiting only the Communist Party's agreement. This is quite like the saying, "Everything is ready, only the east wind is lacking." They also told reporters that the personnel responsible for the emergency repairs in Anyang, Baotou, and other places had requested the Communist Army's permission to start repairing the roads, but the Communist Army refused, saying that they had not yet received orders. Personnel from the Communist side of the Executive Headquarters believe that the implementation of transportation restoration involves extremely complex issues, including equipment, personnel, and road protection, which require lengthy discussions, and specifically expressed their desire for the "neutralization of railways." It is generally judged that to quickly restore transportation, not only the conciliation of American personnel is needed, but also the participation of American technical personnel.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The Military Conciliation Executive Headquarters has dispatched small groups to various places to enforce the ceasefire order, which has come to an end. Today, it began to deal with the second issue of restoring transportation. Three committees and staff members are working day and night at the headquarters of Peking Union Medical College Hospital to discuss how to proceed. The Communist side advocates that the restoration of transportation should include all transportation, such as railways, waterways, highways, and postal services. The Central Government side said that all transportation should be opened as soon as possible, but railway transportation is the most needed, so it should be restored first. This kind of dispute occurred during the Chongqing negotiations last autumn, and it has not been resolved yet. The Communist side also requested that once the transportation lines are restored, they should be guaranteed not to be used to assist in the war, which shows that the mutual suspicion has not been completely eliminated.

<h3>"China in the Sun" New Book Published</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, New York, 27th] Literary critic Gannett described Randall Gould's new book "China in the Sun" in detail in the book review column of the New York Herald Tribune on the 24th. Gannett commented: "The author of 'China in the Sun', Gould, has now returned to China to restore the publication of the Shanghai Da Mei Evening News, which was interrupted by the Japanese in 1941. Mr. Lan is from Minnesota, USA. Since he went to China in the spring of 1924, most of his time has been spent in China. His writings on China have consistent meaning, which is not found in the writings of others who claim to be familiar with the situation in China. He said that China has been in the process of revolution for 30 years, and the current dispute between the Chongqing government and the Communist Party is, in his personal view, nothing more than another chapter in a long history. He believes that the best way to understand China is to compare it with the United States in the 18th century, when the provinces of the United States were deeply divided and transportation facilities were only in their infancy. This book is the best work on the great tapestry of 20th century Chinese history, and its intimate tone and rich materials are particularly characteristic."</p>

<h3>Security Council's First Test: Tense Atmosphere at Yesterday's Meeting, Iranian Representative's Statement Requests Order for Soviet Troops to Withdraw, Iranian Appeal Decided to be Discussed Again Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a London broadcast on the 28th: The Security Council, the cornerstone of the entire United Nations organization, will face its first major test this afternoon as to whether it can serve as an international arbitrator. The council formally allowed Iran to present its complaint against the Soviet Union. At the time, the atmosphere was tense and the public gallery was packed. After the meeting started, the first issue discussed was Albania's request to join the United Nations, which lasted for an hour. Finally, it was decided to include Albania's application on the agenda. Then the chief representative of the Soviet Union spoke, advocating an immediate discussion of the Iranian issue, but the conference decided to postpone it until Wednesday. Security Council Chairman Makin proposed that the Iranian representative should be allowed to participate in the Security Council meeting when discussing the Iranian complaint, and asked if any representatives objected to this proposal. At that time, all representatives focused on Soviet chief representative Vyshinsky. As no representatives raised objections, Iranian representative Tai Quchaida took his seat, only six feet away from Vyshinsky. The Iranian representative said that the Iranian government had sent notes to the Soviet government several times, requesting permission for Iranian troops to enter Azerbaijan, but the Soviet government neither denied nor answered. The Iranian representative said that this dispute was particularly regrettable, because Iran was originally an ally of the Soviet Union, and Iran had also contributed to the Soviet Union's victory. Finally, the former Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi intended to go to Moscow, but was also rejected, so the Iranian side had to appeal to the Security Council. The Iranian representative also pointed out that the Soviet Union interfered in Iran's internal affairs, violated the Tehran Agreement, and warned that if Iran could not freely move its troops within its own country, there might be tragic consequences. At this point, the Iranian representative requested that Soviet troops withdraw from Iranian territory before March 2nd, and requested the Security Council to pass this request.</p>
<p>[United Press, Iranian Capital, 28th] Iranian Prime Minister Shahdana announced today that he has instructed Shah Tai, the head of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, to discuss the Iranian complaint against the Soviet Union with Vyshinsky, the head of the Soviet delegation. Shah Tai was Prime Minister during the Tehran Three-Power Conference, a friend of Vyshinsky, and speaks fluent Russian.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] News from Tehran last night said that Iranian Prime Minister Shahdana had issued a new instruction to the Iranian delegation in London, but as of four hours before the United Nations Security Council meeting this afternoon, the Iranian delegation had not yet received this new instruction. Iran's complaint against Soviet interference in its internal affairs is on the agenda of the Security Council this afternoon.</p>

In addition, the United Nations General Assembly received a memorandum of 10,000 words from New York, pointing out that the Argentine government is still a dictatorial regime, with the aim of aggression, and violates all obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter, advocating that Argentina be excluded from the United Nations organization. Therefore, Argentina's application for membership may not be discussed at this session. The General Assembly's agenda is nearing completion. The important cases that have not yet been discussed include the election of the Secretary-General of the United Nations organization and 15 judges of the International Court of Justice. Judging from the progress of the meeting, the experience of small countries has been better than expected. During this period, the Arab League and most Latin American countries have led the struggle for the interests of small countries. Most small countries were initially afraid that the five major powers had already obtained control in the Security Council and would also gain the same power in the General Assembly, so they tried their best to ensure that the General Assembly voted by a majority vote to weaken the position of the major powers in the meeting. This move has been fulfilled.</p>
<h3>Four Powers Start Drafting Peace Treaty with Italy, France, United States and Austria Demand Border Revisions, Soviet Union Seeks Trusteeship of Tripoli</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The New York Times correspondent said that representatives of the foreign ministries of various countries are drafting a draft of the Italian peace treaty. The British representative has proposed a plan to establish Italian colonies under trusteeship, suggesting that Italy's colonies be temporarily handed over to the four powers drafting the peace treaty, namely Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, pending the completion of the entire United Nations trusteeship plan. The representatives of the four powers are busy sorting out the many outstanding issues left over from the foreign ministers' conference last autumn, so they have no time to consider the British proposal for the time being. In addition, the Soviet Union advocates obtaining exclusive trusteeship rights in Tripolitania. Soviet representative Gusev is waiting for instructions from Moscow. Until he receives them, there will be no way to discuss this trusteeship issue. In the past one or two weeks, Britain and the United States have requested to obtain national trusteeship rights for African colonies and Pacific islands. Therefore, the Soviet Union is unwilling to lag behind and intends to claim the same rights for Tripolitania. The Soviet Union has not yet expressed its opinion on the Dodecanese Islands, which is a matter that all parties are urgently awaiting. It is reported that the Soviet Union also supports Yugoslavia's claim to the port of Trieste. In addition, there is the issue of reparations. Britain, the United States, and France believe that Italy should not and is unable to bear the reparations. France's demands on Italy seem to have decreased compared to the foreign ministers' conference last autumn. The French still demand to obtain Brigga and Danda on the Italian border, but no longer demand Valdosta in northwestern Italy and the area near Lake Chad in southern Libya. The most forceful advocate of obtaining Italian land was De Gaulle, and De Gaulle's departure will ease France's attitude.</p>
<h3>Romanian and Bulgarian Issues: Britain and Soviet Union Reach Understanding</h3>

<h3>British-Soviet Relations in Abnormal State, British Security Concessions to Soviet Union Fail to Obtain Corresponding Rewards</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The New York Times correspondent said: The British Foreign Minister sat next to the Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs at the international conference and even said that he was tired of the accusations against the Soviet government, which shows that British-Soviet relations, or Britain's traditional foreign policy, have experienced unexpected events. At the same time, British newspapers used terms such as "political deception," "untrustworthy behavior," and "malicious boring actions" to describe Soviet propaganda and foreign policy, which can also indicate the abnormal state of relations between the two countries. The British do feel tired. They feel that the privileges demanded by the Soviet Union are those that the Soviet Union itself is unwilling to give to others. The security concessions given by Britain to the Soviet Union have failed to obtain corresponding payments. Britain has not expressed opposition to the Soviet Union's demands on the Baltic countries, Poland, Finland, East Prussia, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria, but when Britain advocates maintaining closer relations with Western European countries or implementing its security policy in Southern Europe or the Middle East, Moscow expresses firm opposition. The British feel that the situation they face is as follows: Britain, with a population of 45 million, is being asked by the Soviet Union, with a population of 200 million and the world's largest land army, to recognize its alliances with neighboring governments as security measures, while Britain is not allowed to have other security arrangements except relying on the United Nations. Under these circumstances, there are four possible paths that Britain can take: (1) trust the goodwill of the Soviet Union and let it do what it wants; (2) restore the balance of power policy and not allow only one power to exist on the European continent; (3) rely on the United Nations; (4) improve the United Nations Charter, so that the powers either obey the constraints of United Nations law, or confront the combined forces of various countries, and also use the Western European regional agreement as a backing for the United Nations. Judging from the current situation, no British government dares to trust the Soviet Union's goodwill, and at the same time, Britain or the United Nations is not sure how to act against the aggression of a certain power. Because the British government fears the Soviet Union, and because Britain has not yet determined its constitution, it is most likely that Britain's foreign policy will take the aforementioned fourth path. The true balance of power policy is for the United Nations to take united action against warring countries. Representatives of various countries attending the United Nations General Assembly expect that after the peace treaties are signed, the uncertain situation in the international community may be eased, and the relations between Britain and the Soviet Union may improve.</p>
<h3>Former British Cabinet Member Criticizes Labor Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] Former British Conservative Party cabinet member Macmillan criticized the Labor government today, saying that under the leadership of the Labor Party, Britain's friendly relations with the Soviet Union have gradually decreased, and even with the United States, they are far less close than in the past. It was previously claimed that after the Labor Party came to power, British-Soviet relations could be improved immediately, but today, our friendly relations with old allies have been seriously threatened.</p>
<h3>British-American Commercial Aviation Establish Reciprocal Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hamilton, Bermuda, 28th] Britain and the United States have been discussing the issue of reciprocal commercial aviation rights for two weeks, and it is reported that an agreement has been reached today. It is believed that the United States may establish agreements of the same nature with other countries.</p>
<h3>Viceroy Wavell Addresses Indian Parliament</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 28th] Viceroy Lord Wavell delivered the shortest Governor-General's address in history to the Indian Central Parliament today, saying that the British government is determined to establish an executive committee composed of political leaders and to organize a constitutional mechanism as soon as possible. I cannot elaborate on the organization of these institutions at this time, nor can I explain how to overcome various difficulties, nor is it convenient to determine the date when India will gain freedom. I can only assure you that these events will be the first things to be carried out by the governments of London and New Delhi. The Viceroy added that some of you may wish to vote against the government's measures, and the decision to do so is up to you. But I feel that legislation is in the interests of the entire Indian people, and to prevent or delay it is a short-sighted policy.</p>
<h3>London Public Meeting Demands Indian Independence and Expresses Sympathy for the Liberation Struggle in East India and Vietnam; Procession to Government Petition Follows Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The Indian League held a demonstration rally yesterday in Trafalgar Square opposing British policy in India and Indonesia. More than two thousand people participated, and the police deployed positions at key points, maintaining strict vigilance. The flags of the Congress Party were displayed all around Nelson's Column, and speakers gave speeches from the base of the monument. Member of Parliament for Manchester, Mr. Kinsey, was the first to speak, saying that you are representatives of London, and this is an opportunity to express deep sympathy for the independence movements of Java, Vietnam, and India. The venue was equipped with loudspeakers, and the colorful clothing of Indian women added a beautiful touch to the meeting.</p>
<p>A banner reading "Reap the Full Fruits of Victory" was hung from the column at the venue. Member of Parliament for Wales, Mr. Cove, in his speech, warned the government to prepare for the backlash from the Bombay shootings. He said that although he supports the Labor government, if it continues to implement imperialist policies, it will have to use imperialist methods, and he sincerely hopes that the Labor government will not go down this path. As the mood at the venue gradually became tense, Mr. Cove said that you should support this mission and ask the members of parliament to protect the freedom of the people of the East. Indian Communist candidate Mr. Dutt also said that we are meeting here not only for the benefit of the people of India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, but also for your benefit. We cannot allow our people to participate in actions that interfere with the freedom struggle of other nations. The meeting passed two resolutions, demanding independence for India and demanding that the British government recognize the independence of Indonesia. After the meeting, the crowd marched in procession, following Government Buildings to the Foreign Office and the India Office to present the resolutions. The police took the lead in protecting the Indian students carrying the Congress Party flags, followed by the Secretary of the Indian League, Mr. Menon, and British Members of Parliament Mr. Cove and Mr. Hutchinson. The procession included young girls, old women, veterans of the two world wars, British military officers, Dutch sailors, American aviators, and three Indian soldiers. As the bell of the Government Buildings struck four, the procession set off. While the leaders entered the Foreign Office and the India Office, the rest stood in front of the Government Buildings, shouting slogans and jeering. The procession then returned to Trafalgar Square, where Chairman Hutchinson told the crowd: "We have complied with the order to submit the resolutions to the India Office and the Foreign Office. In the Foreign Office, a foreign ministry official left a message saying that Mr. Bevin had been invited out, but would read the resolutions and consider them within an hour. In the India Office, there was no one in charge. While India is in deep water, the office handling Indian affairs had no one there except a person who has no relation to the India Office. We had no choice but to leave the resolution with that person to forward to the Secretary of State for India immediately. Both resolutions will be considered and answered, and the response will be published in the newspapers or announced at another public gathering here. Now that we have submitted the resolutions, this meeting will be talked about by the people in India, Vietnam, and Indonesia, and they will know that the British people support their struggle for freedom." The crowd then donated two thousand rupees to the Indian League to express their practical sympathy for the Indian cause. The procession was a quarter of a mile long, and as it passed the monument, the Indian flags were held at an angle to pay tribute to those who died in the two world wars. The spectators on the side of the road were numerous.</p>
<h3>Japanese Female Lawyer Advocates Amending Civil Code</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] Miss Michiko Watanabe, one of Japan's eleven female lawyers, gave a radio speech last night, pointing out that Japan's civil code, enacted in 1897, "is full of feudal ideas." She declared that the civil code must be revised so that couples can enjoy equal rights. She stated that Japanese women are listed as quasi-incompetent, and all important actions must be permitted by their husbands. A wife can only inherit her husband's property if she has no children. She also said that Japan's marriage law favors men and is disadvantageous to women. She advocated appointing a committee to revise the Japanese civil code and allowing women to participate in the committee.</p>
<h3>Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese People Ordered to Evacuate Malaya</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 27th Special Dispatch] The British authorities announced that Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese civilians, along with Japanese military personnel, must evacuate all parts of Malaya immediately and may not beg to stay for any reason. Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese civilians who have not yet been detained in concentration camps have been ordered to enter the camps separately, with a deadline of the 31st of this month for voluntary entry, otherwise they will be arrested and imprisoned. The authorities also issued a notice to all sectors to report the movements of the above-mentioned civilians to the military and security agencies. The second batch of Japanese to be repatriated left Singapore for Japan yesterday on a Japanese ship.</p>
<h3>Atomic Bomb Test: Records and Inferences</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] U.S. Army and Navy experts are preparing to use a fleet as a target to test the power of the atomic bomb. So far, only three atomic bombs have been used. The first was tested in New Mexico, and the other two were used to attack Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. From these three experiences, experts collected information from all parties and obtained the following records or inferences: (1) At the moment of the bomb's explosion, the initial pressure reached hundreds of thousands of pounds per inch, followed by a blast wind with a speed of five hundred to one thousand miles per hour. Although it was temporary, its power was extremely fierce, as a speed of more than seventy-five miles per hour is usually called a gale. (2) When tested at sea, it will generate waves ranging from low to one hundred feet high. (3) At the center of the so-called "fireball," the heat can reach one hundred million degrees Fahrenheit. As the heat wave spreads from the center to the surroundings, the heat will drop sharply, but it will still have fierce destructive power. According to a report by American scientists, people within a mile of the bomb's explosion will be burned to death or seriously injured even if they are not killed by "mechanical force." The explosion of the bomb also produces a large amount of radiation. Its effect in Hiroshima and Nagasaki affected the blood cell tissue, causing blood to seep out and flow into the internal organ gaps even in those whose skin seemed unharmed. U.S. military officers and scientists believe that in the two attacks on Japan, this radiation had little residual power because the bombs exploded in the air, and the radiation disappeared very quickly and did not stay on the ground. However, according to some scientists, if the bomb explodes near the ground, as planned this time, a large amount of radioactive material equivalent to several tons of radium could be left behind. Due to this threat, all islands near the test site may be affected by radioactive waves or clouds. Therefore, as a precaution, the islanders must be evacuated to prevent accidents. Although the walls of some houses in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were directly bombed, they remained standing because the pressure was completely downward, but the roofs and floors were all shattered into pieces. Some clues about the impact on steel-framed buildings were obtained in Nagasaki, where the Mitsubishi torpedo factory was completely disintegrated by the pressure. The officials in charge refused to disclose how the fleet will be arranged during this experiment, but said that several battleships will be placed in the center of the bomb's explosion and will be spread over a very large area, loaded with automatic recording instruments to study various degrees of damage.</p>
<h3>President Gouin Calls on the Nation to Help the Government Overcome Difficulties; Finance and People's Livelihood Are the Two Current Problems; French Foreign Policy Remains the Same</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a broadcast from San Francisco on the 28th, French President Gouin issued a statement today: All French people should fully assist the newly formed French cabinet in order to overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a broadcast from Paris on the 28th, French President Gouin declared to the press today: "In order to improve the domestic economic and financial situation, the French government has decided to take extremely strict measures to awaken the people, but all decisions will be made in accordance with democratic principles. The people's responsibilities are currently very heavy. I took office as president not because of internal motivation, but because of a sense of responsibility. I deeply hope that this sense of responsibility will inspire all French people."</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a broadcast from Paris on the 28th, the newly appointed French President Gouin declared at today's French cabinet meeting: "There will be no change in French foreign policy. This policy was previously announced by the French Foreign Minister at the United Nations General Assembly. The new government is currently encountering two problems: one is supply, and the other is finance. I am confident that the French people will be able to accept these problems with the perseverance they have shown in other difficult times."</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 27th] French interim President Gouin convened the first meeting of the new cabinet today and is scheduled to announce his policy guidelines to parliament tomorrow. It is said that the French people may inevitably hear unpleasant news. Today's cabinet meeting discussed food, finance, and international issues. Gouin advocated increasing taxes, stabilizing prices, and reducing government spending to prevent inflation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The new cabinet's second meeting is scheduled to be held tonight.

<h3>Whales Fight to the Death on Island Coast</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The Department of the Interior announced yesterday that tens of thousands of petrels, guillemots, sea ducks, seagulls, and wild ducks were fighting with a large number of whales at sea. Their feathers were stained by oil floating on the sea, losing their buoyancy, causing many to drown. Many whales also died in the battle.</p>
<h3>The World's Attentive Focus: The Movement of the U.S. Congress</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] The people of the United States and even the world will closely watch the U.S. Congress's handling of the U.S. loan to Britain for the following reasons: (1) The strength shown by the opposition will have a significant impact on the U.S. government's procedures for lending to foreign countries this year. This procedure is currently awaiting approval of the credit loan to Britain to determine its future. (2) The course of action the U.S. Congress takes in handling affairs can be seen from this debate. (3) This will prove whether the U.S. Congress's dissatisfaction with President Truman's domestic agenda will extend to Congress's attitude toward the president's foreign relations and international cooperation policies. (4) This will show whether the United States is rapidly moving toward a new isolationism. The loan to Britain may encounter more dangerous and significant opposition in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, but the U.S. government expected this early on and has formulated countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Burma's Demand for Autonomy Attracts U.S. Attention</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] According to information obtained by Washington diplomatic circles, the recent Anti-Fascist Conference in Rangoon resolved to demand Burma's complete independence in place of the current dominion system. This move has attracted the attention of U.S. observers. They hope that the Burmese Legislative Council meeting in Rangoon today will reveal the intentions of the current Burmese government and clarify the country's political situation. It is reported that the recent meeting also passed a resolution condemning the rampant banditry in Burma after liberation.</p>
<h3>Anti-Government Conspiracy Uncovered in Albania</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] The Soviet News Agency reported today that "the conspiracy of fascist terrorists to overthrow the Albanian government and assassinate its leaders has been uncovered. The main culprits of the conspiracy have also been arrested in cities such as Tirana and Shkodër." The news agency also reported an Albanian government communiqué stating that the authorities had previously discovered a fascist organization in Shkodër called the "Albanian United Association." Those arrested were related to well-known criminals living abroad and attempted to contact Albanians who had fled to Greece to cause trouble. Some of those arrested actively supported Greek fascism.</p>
<h3>U.S. Labor Strike Situation Improves; Canning Factory Workers Resumed Work Yesterday; Steel Industry Also Shows Signs of Early Resolution</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chicago, 27th] The government took over the canning factories on Saturday and Sunday due to the strike by meatpacking and canning workers belonging to the two major labor unions in the United States demanding increased wages. It is now reported that 248,000 workers will resume work on Monday, and deliveries can begin on Wednesday. The government also expressed optimism about other labor strikes today.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] A government official predicted on Sunday night that the steel industry strike could end within a week. It is said that this news came from a source close to someone in charge of the government's labor policy, but it cannot be verified in detail. The steel industry strike has been going on for a week, and the hope for an early resolution has greatly increased since the resolution of the Ford and Chrysler auto company strikes and may gain an advantage within a week. In addition, there are other pressures that can lead to victory. Although the White House does not intend to intervene within three or four days, many changes may occur after that, which is difficult to predict. The steel industry's general strike began at midnight on January 20, with 800,000 workers participating, covering 1,292 factories in 30 states, making it the largest labor strike in the history of the American steel industry. Although President Truman tried his best to mediate and wanted to establish a compromise between the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the U.S. Steel Corporation, it ultimately failed. Only Kaiser, the general manager of the West Coast steel plant, accepted the president's proposal and agreed to increase wages by 18.5 cents per hour. The steel industry union initially demanded an increase of 23 cents per hour, but the management only agreed to an increase of 12.5 cents. After repeated negotiations, the labor side agreed to reduce the increase to 19.5 cents per hour, but the management would only increase it to 14 cents at most. The negotiations broke down on January 19, and the general strike began at midnight on the 20th.</p>
<h3>British Reply to Egypt on Treaty Revision Request</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] A Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that the British reply to Egypt's letter of December 20, 1945, regarding the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty has been delivered to the Egyptian ambassador. It is believed that the reply is quite sympathetic to the letter, and the two governments are preparing to publish the letters from both sides simultaneously. Well-informed sources believe that the issue of the date and manner of revising the treaty will be jointly reviewed by both parties. It is heard that Egypt is eager to modify the status of Sudan and to have British troops withdraw from Egyptian territory. The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, drafted in 1936, only allows British troops to be stationed outside the Canal Zone during wartime. Therefore, the withdrawal of British troops from most parts of Egypt can be discussed separately from the major conditions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 28th] Three Egyptian cabinet members resigned yesterday because the government did not submit the issues of Egyptian independence and British troop withdrawal to the United Nations General Assembly. They have now withdrawn their resignations, and the Egyptian political crisis has subsided.</p>
<h3>United States Creates New Type of Bomber with Unparalleled Speed and Power</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The Navy Department announced today a powerful new dive-torpedo bomber that will be carried on the Midway-class supercarriers. It has a maximum range of more than 1,700 miles and can dive vertically at a speed of more than 500 miles per hour, attacking targets with a 4,000-pound bomb or rocket or torpedo and a 2,000-pound bomb or rocket. This new bomber is called the BTM Mauler and was designed and manufactured by the Martin Company of Baltimore, specifically for new, giant aircraft carriers. It has a level flight speed of more than 350 miles per hour. Without bombs, it weighs 17,500 pounds, which is 1,000 pounds more than the same type of aircraft currently in use. This aircraft is equipped with a special braking engine that can reduce the maximum speed of vertical dives from more than 500 miles per hour to within 350 miles per hour, making bombing more accurate. Its wing-mounted dive brakes can be released in five seconds at extremely high speeds. The aircraft is equipped with the world's largest aircraft engine, with 3,000 horsepower. Its Curtis four-blade electric propeller is 14 feet 8 inches in diameter. The aircraft has a wingspan of 50 feet, a fuselage length of 41 feet 8 inches. The wings have a box structure, and the outer wing panels can be folded vertically for easy loading on aircraft carriers. The aircraft is equipped with four 20mm guns, and the bombs, rockets, and torpedoes it carries are suspended outside.</p>

<h3>A New Chapter in the History of Exploration in New Guinea: US Air Force Discovers the Grand Valley; The Curly-Haired Savages Lead a Unique Way of Life; Translated by the Editorial Office of This Newspaper from the December Issue of National Geographic Magazine</h3>
<p>"Colonel, beyond the ridge, you can enter the deep canyon that turns toward the hidden valley."</p>
<p>As I was piloting a C-60 Star plane over the mountains 10,000 feet above sea level in the interior of New Guinea, conducting a curved-line aerial reconnaissance, these words came from the intercom microphone. The sky was filled with cloud-covered holes. The one who told me these words was my co-pilot, Sergeant Grim.</p>
<p>A week earlier, he discovered the hidden valley of New Guinea, while he flew around, searching for a relatively low mountain path among the steep mountains of the Orange Mountains. The existence of this hidden valley was not revealed to the world until 1938 by the American Museum of Natural History expedition led by the Archbold Biological Station. This was only the second time that white men had come to this mile-high, enclosed valley. Later, we learned that the Archbold expedition renamed it the Grand Valley.</p>
<h3>Searching for a Landing Strip; Soldiers Become Explorers</h3>
<p>This time, the explorers were not American and Dutch scientists, but American soldiers.</p>
<p>Our brothers came here to find a location where airplanes could land to fight the Japanese army. When General MacArthur began implementing the island-hopping strategy in New Guinea, the only air route we could use to supply him was over the Stanley Mountains, which stretched 1,500 miles along the southeastern end of the island. After the capture of Dutch New Guinea, the route became much shorter, allowing us to stay close to General MacArthur's vanguard.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Kenney (now General), Commander of the Southwest Pacific Air Forces of the Allied Forces, ordered his subordinates to open a route from the air base in Morotai to Dutch New Guinea. At a minimum, they needed to find a direct route in the middle and landing locations at both ends, so that bases could be built and put into practical use immediately. Sergeant Grim was sent there to scout, and as a result, discovered two possible routes. He paid close attention to this Grand Valley, believing that it had the potential to be used as a landing strip. The first route discovered was about 200 miles southwest of the Grand Valley, passing through Ifitamin. We then set out to inspect it.</p>
<h3>Savages Forming Their Own Tribes Among Cliffs and Sheer Walls</h3>
<p>The Grand Valley, one mile above sea level, lies in the Hubsch Mountains of the snow-capped mountains discovered by Archbold. In these cliffs and sheer walls, there live strange, isolated tribal peoples: many of them die of old age without ever interacting with the outside world. The southern entrance of the Grand Valley is locked by 200 miles of wetlands and narrow gorges. The east and west sides are steep peaks up to 14,000 feet high, no different from its national walls; the only possible entrance is in the north. The fourteen-man crew of the twin-engine Star plane took off from Morotai at dawn. At an altitude of 500 feet, we drilled into the cloud layer. The top of the clouds was still 8,000 feet in the sky.</p>
<h3>Heads Being Cut Off; Or Becoming Crocodile Snacks</h3>
<p>In the middle section between Morotai and the foot of the Orange Mountains, we flew over 200 miles of wetlands. This wetland, seen from above, is as flat as a billiard table. The tribes inhabiting this area are specialized headhunters. These savages are as terrible as the eels that are abundant there. From here, we can easily see why the Dutch Tanahmerah penal colony is the most effectively managed in the world. The only escape route for prisoners is down the river. If he escapes into the wetlands, then whether his head is cut off or he becomes a snack for the crocodiles is up to him to choose.</p>
<p>As we approached the Orange Mountains, the cloud layer became even higher! But we caught a glimpse of a particularly steep cliff. Above the Grand Valley, a rare white sheep-like cloud formation floated. We could see an occasional gap. We knew that many mountain peaks were lurking inside, with the higher peaks emerging above the cloud layer.</p>
<h3>The Author of This Article and His Hunted Macaque</h3>
<p>The person holding the macaque in the picture is the author of this article, Colonel Ayersmore. This monkey has been brought back to the United States by Mr. Ayersmore and given to his daughter. He has flown over the Grand Valley many times. In May of last year, after a US military transport plane crashed in the Grand Valley, he enthusiastically engaged in rescue work and made outstanding contributions.</p>
<h3>Flying Over the Orange Mountains, High Into the Cloud Peaks; Approaching the Grand Valley</h3>
<p>We needed to fly over the Orange Mountains and find a way out on the north side of the valley. Our plane climbed to 17,000 feet before we could safely fly through or around the cloud peaks. We saw Mount Wilhelm, more than 15,000 feet high. It's strange to see the snow-capped mountains here!</p>
<p>We circled for thirty minutes before beginning our descent. The mountains here are lined up like combs, with peaks ranging from 13,000 feet to 6,000 feet, clearly extending along the north coast of New Guinea. In the middle of each mountain range, there is a river channel flowing through the wetlands. Suddenly, Sergeant Grim pointed to a cloud formation 300 feet above a ridge and shouted into the microphone, "Quick, slip over that ridge!" So we slipped over the ridge and entered a canyon, and then repeated flying below the cloud layer, catching our breath. As our plane descended, the canyon became narrower and narrower. The surrounding cliffs also became steeper and steeper. At this time, we made a circle, and a straight cliff stood opposite us, causing my breathing to suddenly become tense. However, Grim spoke again: "There is a gap between the cliff and the cloud formation. Let's keep flying into the middle. The valley is below here!"</p>
<h3>A Natural Great Cave; The Balim River Rushes Through</h3>
<p>As we flew over the cliff, we observed a natural great cave, which could also be said to be a natural great tunnel. Its rounded top had a radius of at least 300 feet. The Balim River below our plane suddenly drilled into the cliffs of the deep gorge.</p>
<p>On the other side of the ridge, we saw native villages scattered on the valley, extending almost to the cliffs that reached into the clouds. In this valley, about ten miles away, the water of the Balim River gushed out from another mountain and continued to meander towards its future. In the clouds, a line of gaps suddenly opened, and this picturesque Grand Valley was revealed to our eyes at this time.</p>
<h3>The Entire Territory of the Grand Valley Is a Fertile and Rich Field</h3>
<p>Lying among these mountains are the unique tribal villages. We got an overview of the entire area: the Grand Valley has a total length of 30 miles in the vertical direction, and a large river called the Balim flows through it. The Balim River flows from a gorge at the north end, and the rapids form a waterfall that flows into the valley. Its momentum becomes slow. After leaving the valley, it extends into another gorge surrounded by steep walls, hanging upside down and becoming a turbulent torrent until it enters the sea. The entire valley soil, and even the surrounding cliffs, are fertile and rich, which is very different from other parts of New Guinea.</p>
<p>The farmland is intertwined with ditches, and agricultural products are growing everywhere. Men, women, and children are all working diligently in the fields, which is also different from other tropical areas. Our plane's sudden appearance, of course, frightened these people. As the plane descended rapidly, they scattered in all directions, some lying in the sweet potato fields, and some jumping into the ditches.</p>
<p>One thing that was strange was that the ditches and villages in the Grand Valley were arranged in an orderly manner, no less than American farms. The fields they cultivated extended to the cliffs that reached into the clouds. American farmers would never dare to climb so high! The native houses were all built at the foot of the mountains, some vaguely hiding in the trees.</p>
<h3>Natives Throw Spears; Attempting to Stab the Reconnaissance Plane</h3>
<p>Every village is built with wooden and stone fences, and everywhere there is a kind of watchtower standing. We flew very low, wanting to take a closer look. These towers are all made of trees pieced together, and there is a sentinel at the top of the tower, as if standing guard, hiding on it. Our plane clearly disrupted the lookout system. This "sentinel" climbed down desperately and slipped into the thatched cottage like a fly. When we flew low again, a native actually threw his spear upwards, wanting to stab our plane's fuselage.</p>
<p>Houses are built along both sides of the river. This river is undoubtedly a natural defensive line for warring tribes. We couldn't see any beams or ships. But the natives did know how to build bridges. Later, when we flew close to the walls of this deep valley, we finally discovered a suspension bridge.</p>
<p>We learned very little about the local natives during this reconnaissance flight, only gaining some clues from the photographs. We felt that the natives here were taller than the people we had met in other parts of New Guinea. Later, when we passed by during combat operations, we learned more detailed information about the 60,000 residents of the Grand Valley. This time, we only saw from the air that their houses were round, built almost like Eskimo igloos, some long and round, mostly close to the trees.</p>
<h3>Gaining Information; Flying to Ifitamin</h3>
<p>After obtaining many photos and survey data here, we flew to Ifitamin to find the second possible landing site. Whether in terms of distance, climate, or navigation, Ifitamin was more suitable than the Grand Valley. We then decided to use Ifitamin. At the same time, according to the results of a survey conducted by a certain investigation team in Kyushu several years ago, it was believed that the natives there were very friendly. We not only wanted to avoid unfortunate bloodshed incidents, but also wanted to hire natives to engage in construction work. From our Dutch or Australian friends, we could not obtain any records of whether white people had ever been to the Grand Valley. From that time on, I contacted Archbold to compare our captured photo data.</p>
<p>All new pilots undergo standard training on the spot in order to adapt to the climate and soil of New Guinea. The soil and water are as threatening as the Japanese devils, so pilots constantly fly over the Grand Valley to practice. War correspondents therefore obtained many interesting adventure stories. I once flew Georgie Toat and Harley Pantson over the Grand Valley to see it once. They gave the Grand Valley a nickname and called it "Shangri-La Valley."</p>
<p>As a result of repeated flights, the number of pilots who had been there was quite large, enough to form a visiting organization. Many soldiers became members of the "Shangri-La" Association after returning to their home countries. They all have certificates of flight dates.</p>
<h3>American Plane Crashes; Female Soldiers Suffer the Tragedy Together</h3>
<p>Once, during a training flight, a tragedy occurred over the Grand Valley. This happened in May. A military transport plane crashed and fell inside the walls of the Grand Valley. The entire fuselage was burned. Of the 24 people, only 5 survived. Three of them were members of the Women's Army Corps serving at the Dutch New Guinea base. Within 24 hours, two of them died. The one woman and two men who survived subsequently told the whole world many strange and bizarre stories about the Grand Valley.</p>
<p>This time, the author himself presided over the rescue work. Unexpectedly, many inexplicable local situations were answered.</p>
<h3>Three Soldiers Escape Danger; Good News Spreads Throughout the United States</h3>
<p>Seven weeks after the accident, the three surviving soldiers were finally rescued from danger. We used parachutes to drop medical personnel and engineers into the Grand Valley to carry out relief and build runways so that low-flying transport planes could land safely. When the weather was good, we dropped all the food supplies. The two-way communication team then went down, and we broadcast news for our compatriots left in this paradise to listen to.</p>
<p>What a happy thing it was! When the three surviving comrades were rescued back to the Dutch New Guinea base. The surviving female comrade was named Margaret Hastings. She was a corporal in the Women's Army Corps. The story she told was published in newspapers and magazines throughout the United States.</p>
<h3>Pigs Are Fat and Big; Only Cooked During Celebrations</h3>
<p>Pigs are very valuable, and killing or eating a pig is often only held during celebrations. So some pigs, when killed before the festival, are mostly fat and big! The round roofs are all covered with coal ash. The terrain of the Grand Valley is extremely high, and fires are often needed, but there are no chimneys on the houses. Smoke spews out from the cracks in the walls or the thick thatch of the roof. Men wear nothing but a piece of cloth to cover their lower body. Women only have a handful of fig leaves woven into a diaper-like thing, tied around their hips, with two fat and large thighs, with their entire front exposed.</p>
<p>Each village has a very neat style, and banana trees can be seen everywhere. The fields are planted with sweet potatoes. Men mostly live in stone round houses, and women live in rectangular houses.</p>

<h3>Discussions on Methods of Paying Property Rental Income Tax and Protecting Business Rights</h3>
<p>— Tao Gongwen</p>
<p>Following the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau was established and is about to levy property rental income tax in the city. This tax system is still in its initial stages of trial implementation. It is inevitable that there may be shortcomings in the tax law. Therefore, I am providing suggestions regarding the methods of paying this tax for consideration:</p>
<p>Regarding Paying Income Tax:</p>
<p>In principle, a self-assessment and payment method should be adopted. However, for economic reasons and convenience, a withholding system might be considered. However, those who withhold tax have no inherent obligation to do so. Therefore, the government should provide appropriate incentives to those who withhold income tax. For example, when the tax on interest income was first implemented, the government provided financial institutions with a processing fee for withholding interest income tax. Adopting a withholding system requires two conditions: First, the number of taxpayers (income recipients) must be far greater than the number of withholders (income payers), even by a factor of thousands. If a withholding system is adopted, collection and payment costs can be significantly reduced. Second, the withholder must be able to independently calculate the amount of tax to be withheld based on the tax law. For example, interest</p>
<p>Income Tax:</p>
<p>is a fixed-rate tax on the full amount. Financial institutions can calculate the amount of income tax to be withheld based on the tax rate stipulated in Article 6 of the Income Tax Law and the amount of interest earned by each depositor, without waiting for notification from the tax collection agency.</p>
<p>Let us consider whether the current property rental income tax, excluding agricultural land, meets the above conditions if a withholding system is adopted. The answer is no, it does not. First, the number of taxpayers for property rental income tax (landlords) is far smaller than the number of withholders (tenants), the opposite of the situation with interest income tax, where the number of taxpayers (deposit customers) is far greater than the number of withholders (financial institutions). Suppose there are 10,000 landlords (including legal entities) and 100,000 tenants in this city. If a withholding system is adopted, the tax collection agency will have to review 100,000 income reports, distribute 100,000 tax payment notices, and 100,000 people will have to report their income to the tax collection agency and pay taxes to the national treasury or its agent. In some cases, the withholder may have to spend more than 200 yuan on transportation, and spend time worth several times more than 200 yuan to remit a tax of 200 yuan. In this situation, the property rental income tax burden appears small on the surface, but the actual cost of paying the tax exceeds the tax amount by several times. If a self-assessment and payment method is adopted, since the number of taxpayers is only one-tenth of the number of withholders, the manpower and resources spent by the people, the tax collection agency, and the collection agency on property rental income tax can be reduced by nine-tenths, accounting for only one-tenth of the cost under a withholding system. Comparing the two, which is more economical and convenient: self-assessment and payment or withholding? Anyone with a little common sense should be able to tell.</p>
<p>Second, property</p>
<p>Rental Income Tax</p>
<p>has a progressive tax rate and because the income from renting two or more properties owned by the same person must be combined, the withholder cannot independently determine the amount of tax to be withheld and must wait for notification from the tax collection agency. This is distinctly different from interest income tax. Moreover, although the monthly rent paid by a specific tenant is the same, the amount of tax to be withheld often varies greatly due to changes in the total rent receivable by the landlord. Let me illustrate with an example: Suppose a landlord has five houses rented to four people, A, B, C, and D, for 6,000 yuan per house per month. According to Articles 3 and 6 of the Property Rental and Sale Income Tax Law and Article 12 of the Implementing Rules, the property rental income tax payable is 1,620 yuan, and each tenant withholds 405 yuan. Suppose in early February, the landlord buys two more houses and rents them out, receiving 6,000 yuan per house per month. According to the law, the landlord should pay 2,770 yuan per month in rental income tax. The rent paid by A, B, C, and D has not changed, but the amount of income tax to be withheld in February increases from 405 yuan to 461 yuan and 66 fen, 6 li, 6 hao. In this case, where the amount of tax cannot be determined independently by the tenant, the tenant must wait for notification from the tax collection agency before withholding income tax and paying rent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a withholding system is adopted for property rental income tax, excluding agricultural land, and the withholders report the income (rent) of the taxpayers, the competent tax collection agency will have to expend considerable effort to aggregate the income belonging to the same taxpayer without omissions. In today's world, where personal names have not been standardized and property statistics have not been properly maintained, it is practically difficult to comprehensively calculate the income of taxpayers based on reports from withholders scattered across various locations. Suppose someone resides in Shanghai, has houses for rent in Shanghai, and also has houses for rent in Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Qingdao. If a self-assessment and payment method is adopted, the landlord can personally report and pay the tax, without the complicated procedures of comprehensive calculation, and the total property rental income of the taxpayer can be obtained. If a withholding system is adopted, and each tenant reports the income, assuming that each tenant is a highly educated person and accurately reports the true landlord's name and address, the Chongqing Direct Taxation Bureau, the Hankou Direct Taxation Bureau, the Guangzhou Direct Taxation Bureau, and the Qingdao Direct Taxation Bureau must receive the income reports from the tenants of the landlord's houses, and then forward them to the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau to comprehensively calculate the landlord's property rental income in accordance with the law. The complexity of the procedure is evident. The methods of collecting taxes should be simple, convenient, and economical, which is an important principle of public finance. The fact that the current property rental income tax largely adopts a withholding system seems to contradict this important principle.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we do not want property rental income tax to become a good tax in name only, then the method of payment should be entirely self-assessment and payment. We must not imitate the interest income tax and adopt a withholding system, because the objective conditions are completely different.</p>
<h3>The Lucky Surviving Female Sergeant Hastings</h3>
<p>In the American transport plane that crashed and burned over Dagu, there were eight female soldiers, five of whom died on the spot; twenty-four hours later, two more died. Hastings was the luckiest of the eight. In the picture, Ms. Hastings looks worried, gazing at the sky, hoping that her country's planes will come to rescue her soon. The background is the temporary shelter built by the Filipino members of the rescue team.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reading Minister Yu's Speech on Financial Plans</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Yu Hongjun recently came to Shanghai to inspect and gave a speech to reporters from this newspaper, stating that the government has carefully studied the new foreign exchange rate issue and will formulate appropriate measures under the principle of revitalizing and developing international trade, which will be announced soon. This year's financial plan will focus on construction and rehabilitation, but this year's financial expenditures, such as military reorganization, are also quite large. He will now find ways to rectify tax revenues, and at the same time, plan to use foreign materials and strive for the stability of the monetary system and prices, so that the budget is close to balance. Regarding provincial and municipal local finances, it is necessary to first seek the abundance of local finances. The central government is determined to increase the amount of subsidies to local finances, and at the same time, plans to re-divide the series of central finance and local finance to clarify their respective areas. In addition, he also elaborated on issues such as simplifying direct tax procedures and the United Nations International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The above, although only a speech to newspaper reporters, is simple and concise, and has somewhat clarified the country's financial policy. The people in the recovered areas have been separated from the central government's administration for a long time. At the beginning of the restoration, the steps taken by all parties may not be well-organized. For issues related to their own interests, such as the value of currency, the re-determination of foreign exchange rates, the burden of taxation, and the use of received materials, they have long hoped that the central government's responsible heads would make an announcement. Reading Minister Yu's speech to the reporters, it allows them to understand a little about the central government's financial policy, which is beneficial to the people's understanding of the government's policies.</p>
<p>Financial problems are the crux of all problems. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the most serious issues, in addition to political issues, are actually financial and economic problems. The recent labor unrest in the recovered areas, although the reasons are not simple, is mainly a financial and economic problem. The serious threats that people in the recovered areas feel today are mostly due to the fact that there are no concrete measures in the financial and economic fields, or although measures have been drafted, there is no courage to implement them immediately. The increase in the cost of living and the soaring prices are mainly due to the instability of the currency value. Because the currency value is unstable, it affects the turmoil in general life. The rise of labor unrest is mainly because the currency earned by workers' wages is not enough to cover their living expenses. In essence, this is still a problem of unstable currency value. If the value of currency—currency in circulation—cannot be stabilized, all social and economic problems can be related to financial problems. If we do not first seek the rehabilitation and restoration of the currency itself, then all rehabilitation and restoration may not be possible. This situation is common in countries after war, not only in today's China. France, Germany, Austria, and Italy after World War I were all like this; even in the countries after World War II, the situation is the same. My country has resisted for the longest time and suffered the most serious financial trauma. At the time of post-war recovery, what needs to be rehabilitated and restored first is finance, and what needs to be rehabilitated first in finance is the currency issued by the state, and how to stabilize the value of the currency. It is necessary to stabilize the value of the currency so that social unrest can be reduced and move towards a normal path. It is also the hope of the community that today's financial policy requires people with vision and courage to implement it resolutely. Minister Yu is most familiar with the situation in Shanghai, an international financial city. After this careful inspection, I believe there will be brilliant ideas. However, the method must not only have a "method," but also must be "handled," so that the method is valuable.</p>
<p>Secondly, another threat felt by the people in the recovered areas is the complexity of the tax collection system and the increased burden of tax donations. The biggest disturbance is the lack of clarity in the central and local financial systems. In the local authorities, some believe that the central government monopolizes all tax sources, causing local finances to be on the verge of bankruptcy, so they have to seek remedies on their own, leading to apportionments and harsh levies, with cases occurring frequently, and the people and the government feeling their difficulties. Even for taxes within the central system, the tax rates have recently increased repeatedly, so that the people in the recovered areas, after eight years of war, cannot bear the burden, and complaints are heard from time to time. The people in the recovered areas have been looking forward to governance for eight years. Now that the country has been restored, it is time to start afresh with the people. They hope that there will be a reasonable standard for the apportionment and tax burden in finance, so as to avoid disturbing the people.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the country, the main financial problems in front of us are still the few points that the people in the recovered areas hope to achieve. However, in addition to these, some belong to organizational problems and some belong to policy problems. Regarding the organizational problems, there are places in the organization of the Ministry of Finance that need to be effectively adjusted. For example, the establishment of the Direct Tax Bureau seems to be a superfluous thing. Since direct tax is one of the national tax revenues, it should be merged with the Tax Bureau to save effort. Furthermore, the current financial problem is a currency problem, and the management of financial affairs is becoming increasingly complex, which is one of the main businesses of the Ministry of Finance. However, at present, there is only a Coinage Department under the Ministry, and there is no independent unit, such as the National Treasury Bureau, the Tax Bureau, or the Customs Bureau, to be responsible for handling it, which seems to be insufficient to cope with it. The Ministry of Finance should establish a dedicated institution to manage currency and finance, which is already urgently needed in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding policy issues, there is the re-division of central and local finances, the issue of changing the levy of land tax and the retention or abolition of the Ministry of Food, and issues such as salt administration and customs duties. The reason why local finances are helpless is said to be that most of the tax sources are occupied by the central government. It is said that the main tax revenue of Shanghai is still the entertainment and banquet tax, which is almost the only tax that supports the municipality. Even wharves and warehouses cannot be intervened by the municipal government, let alone other things? If this statement is not false, there is a huge problem here. The entertainment and banquet tax is taken from the general public, so why is it that the large factories and large firms in Shanghai receive more benefits from the municipality, but bear so little burden on the municipality? In the re-delimitation of the central and local financial systems, the principle of "ability to pay tax" must not be ignored, so that the burden of tax can be evenly placed on the general taxpayers according to their ability to pay.</p>
<p>Regarding the salt administration, it is a matter of course that the system of lead-bankers and charter-merchants must be abolished. However, it is said that the methods are not uniform. Old merchants in Changlu and Lianghuai still have the privilege of obtaining a similar disguised lead-banker system, while Liangzhe separately recruits new merchants to contract, and I don't know why. In terms of contribution to the country, the old merchants in various places are more or less the same, but in reality, the treatment they receive is very different. The state changes the salt law, and there is original weighing, but the change must be thorough. A system should be clearly defined, or taxes should be levied on the spot, regardless of what is known, or the tax collection system should not be adopted, and the people should be allowed to buy and sell freely. Like the current situation where the lead-banker system is abolished in name, but there is still a system similar to the lead-banker system in reality, not only is the national law unclear, but it also destroys the entire salt administration structure and affects the national economy and people's livelihood, which is no small matter.</p>
<p>All of the above are some thoughts we had after reading Minister Yu's speech. We are willing to offer it to the financial authorities, and it is nothing more than a humble contribution.</p>

<h3>Rumors of Issuing Sun Yat-sen Notes Stir the Market. Minister Yu Denies it. He also Believes that the Announcement of a New Exchange Rate is Speculation. The Use of Frozen U.S. Dollars Requires Application.</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) Yesterday, the city was rife with rumors that the government would issue "Sun Yat-sen" notes. In addition, reports of the types, styles, patterns, foreign exchange rates, issuance dates, etc. of the Sun Yat-sen notes have greatly stimulated the public's imagination.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yu Hongjun (left) and Liu Gongyun (right), Director of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau, took a group photo with Mayor Qian after paying their respects to him at the City Government.</p>
<p>Both Rumors Were Unheard Of</p>
<p>This reporter specifically visited Finance Minister Yu Hongjun, who solemnly denied the matter to the reporter, saying: He has not heard of this matter. The reporter also asked about the rumor that the foreign exchange rate will be announced in Beijing or Shanghai within a week. Yu said that this is purely speculation, and he has not heard of it himself. Regarding the rumor that frozen U.S. dollars can be used, Yu said: Since the U.S. government issued Announcement No. 94 on December 7 last year, the original frozen management laws for various countries in the world have been lifted, and my country has also lifted the freeze. If you want to use this type of unfrozen U.S. dollars, you must go through the procedures for applying for use. However, since December 8 last year, all financial and commercial transactions with the United States are not subject to this restriction.</p>
<p>Meeting with Chinese and Foreign Guests Separately</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Yu separately met with Mr. Litt, Manager of Citibank, Mr. Annad, General Representative, Mr. Peterson, Manager of Chase Bank, Mr. Gray, Manager of HSBC, Mr. Dubo, Manager of Maccari Bank, and Mr. Sangor, Manager of United Bank, stating that the business policy of each foreign bank in my country must comply with the laws and regulations promulgated by my country, and their rights and obligations are equal to those of Chinese banks. Yu convened a meeting of leaders in the city's financial community at his residence the afternoon before yesterday, and met with three foreign guests yesterday morning, including Mr. Fei Liming, General Manager of the American Wei Li Han Company, Mr. Shi Weifu, Director of Yizhong Tobacco Company, and Mr. Xie Pu'er, General Manager of China Business Company. In addition, Huang, Director of the Finance Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Shu Yunzhang of the China Textile Construction Company, and Chen Changtong, Manager of the Foreign Exchange Department of the Bank of China, were also summoned by Yu and given instructions. In addition to summoning the heads of various foreign banks yesterday afternoon, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Propaganda Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce, Ding Guitang, Deputy Chief of Customs, Lieutenant Colonel Davis of the U.S. Army Supply Department in China, and Smith, the American Commercial Counselor, also paid their respects one after another.</p>
<p>Returning to Beijing Today and Going to Chongqing a Week Later</p>
<p>If the weather permits this morning, he will fly to the capital. It is said that this trip will include personally inspecting the matters related to the return of various agencies under the Ministry of Finance to the capital, and will also include reviewing current financial issues with Lu Peizhang, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Finance. Yu will stay in Beijing for a week, and then return to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>High Court Temporary Criminal Court Continues Trial of Traitors</h3>
<p>Five traitors were tried by Judge Liu and Judge Cao of the High Court yesterday morning: (1) Yang Chunting lived with his mistress at No. 5 Renrui Lane, Fanhuangdu. In July of the year before last, he rented his three-story house to Ge Wanjun, who secretly set up a radio station in the bedroom to communicate with the mainland. The suspect suspected that Ge was having an affair with Zuo Yang, so he reported the establishment of the secret radio station to the Japanese, which led to the discovery. (2) Gao Quansheng once served as an agent for the Japanese military police in Yangsiqiao, Pudong, and secretly reported the patriotic youths Ding Weiliang and Huang Haigen, who were arrested. (3) Jiang Yougen, Shen Anfa, and Zuo She recruited laborers to go to the Philippines to build ships for the Japanese Navy. (4) Zhang Qipin opened the Fuxing Nail Factory to manufacture nails for the Japanese Jiangnan Shipyard. (5) Yang Xiguang served as an investigator for the puppet Special High Section and arrested several of our aviation personnel, including Han Zhen. Witnesses were summoned in each of the above cases and the trials were adjourned for reconsideration.</p>
<h3>Land Forcibly Conscripted by the Enemy and Puppet Can be Returned by the Government</h3>
<p>The Zhabei, Nanshi, Longhua, Hongqiao, and Jiangwan areas of this city suffered greatly from the ravages of the enemy and puppets during the Anti-Japanese War. Later, as the Japanese war situation became tense, they forcibly requisitioned land to arrange defense works. Once an area was designated as a requisition area, even if there were houses and buildings within the scope, they had to be demolished immediately without any compensation. The reporter recently visited the Land Bureau about this matter, which is related to the people and the loss of rights and interests. According to the Land Bureau, regarding the land requisitioned by the enemy and puppets, if no compensation has been paid and our government does not have actual needs, it will be investigated and returned one by one to show the government's intention to protect the people's rights and interests to the greatest extent.</p>
<h3>Qian Changzhao Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Qian Changzhao, Deputy Director of the Resources Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday to inspect the various factories under the committee. Qian will stay in Shanghai for three days.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Orders Electricity Workers: Resumption of Work Ordered Imminently; Department Store Strike Resolved Satisfactorily</h3>
<p>The electricity company strike, despite the efforts of representatives from the five major public utilities' labor unions to mediate, yielded no results. Yesterday at 3 PM, Mr. Faris was summoned to the Social Affairs Bureau to meet with Labor Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan. He expressed his personal opinions on the eleven demands put forward by the labor side. The new Bureau Director, Mr. Wu Kaixian, in order to resolve the strike immediately, ordered the company's employee representatives to resume work imminently after taking office. He also scheduled a meeting for 2 PM today to convene representatives from both sides for mediation in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>The order was delivered to the electricity company this morning. The original text reads: "Order to Ouyang Zurun et al., representatives of the Shanghai Electricity Company employees: It has been found that the employees have been on strike since the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, starting from the head office and spreading to the Fellen Road and Yangshupu power plants, resulting in a complete work stoppage. Although this Bureau investigated the facts and convened a mediation committee in accordance with the law, they refused to attend, citing the decision of the general assembly as an excuse. Furthermore, despite the efforts of Committee Member Wang of the Municipal Party Department, representatives of the General Labor Union, and Bureau Representative Zhu Chenghao of this Bureau to persuade them, they continued to insist on their position and refused to attend, showing contempt for the law. It must be known that public utilities are not allowed to strike according to law. As for the employees' concerns that they may be dismissed by the employer for being elected as worker representatives, besides dealing with any violations of laws, company regulations, etc., in accordance with the law, party and government representatives have already provided guarantees. The representatives can attend the meeting without fear and await mediation. As the Director of this Bureau, I am initiating my tenure with a focus on protecting labor and following regulations. Therefore, I specifically order the workers to resume work imminently. A meeting has been scheduled for 2 PM on the 29th of this month to convene representatives from both sides for mediation in accordance with the law. You must comply and not disobey. This is an urgent order. Director Wu Kaixian, Deputy Director Tong Xingbai."</p>
<p>Nine Major Companies Officially Resume Work</p>
<p>The strike at nine major department stores, including Sincere (先施), which had lasted for five days, was resolved satisfactorily last night at 7 PM. At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, representatives from both labor and management gathered at the Social Affairs Bureau. Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan's mediation was unsuccessful. The newly appointed Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, personally urged both sides to make concessions. Subsequently, the labor representatives telegraphed the various companies to resume work immediately. Detailed regulations were agreed upon at 7 PM, with wages increased to 32,500 yuan. The labor side expressed satisfaction, and work will officially resume today.</p>
<p>Year-End Bonus for Waterworks Resolved</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Waterworks Company's request for a year-end bonus for all employees, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian personally instructed the company's employees not to take any action before a solution was reached. At the same time, he instructed both labor and management to begin negotiations. It is reported that an agreement was reached by last night. The solution is that those who have served for more than one year will receive a bonus of one month's salary, and those who have served for less than one year will receive a bonus based on a percentage that decreases sequentially.</p>
<p>North China Daily News Strike Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Workers in the machine room of the English-language North China Daily News went on strike on the afternoon of the 28th. It is reported that 80% of the workers walked out. It is said that the newspaper issued half a month's salary for January last Saturday, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year. In addition, they also offered one-third of a month's salary as a Lunar New Year bonus. The workers felt dissatisfied with this and demanded an adjustment of salaries, an increase of 100%, and an advance of one month's salary. When their demands were not met, they began to strike. The newspaper's management, however, believes that the treatment given to employees since the newspaper's resumption of publication is higher than that of general printing houses.</p>

<p>(Report from this newspaper) The two freighters ordered in the U.S. by the former Ministry of Communications are named Zhongshan and Zhongtong, each with a tonnage of 10,480 tons. They are called sister ships. The Zhongshan arrived in Shanghai at the end of last November and is now running between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao, transporting coal. The Zhongtong also came from New York, loaded with a large number of relief supplies. Because there is no wharf to dock, it is waiting outside the Wusong estuary to be imported. Both ships fly the national flag and are still represented by the American President Lines.</p>

The results were announced yesterday afternoon: A total of twenty-five people, including Kanzō Uchiyama, were elected, but they must still undergo a final review before a decision can be made. This election is a test of self-governance given to the Japanese residents by our authorities. The 80,000 Japanese residents have high expectations for the new committee members. Their future tasks are roughly as follows: democratization of the autonomous association, acceleration of withdrawal work, solving life problems after returning to Japan, promoting women's rights, rebuilding Japan, and strengthening the solidarity of 80,000 Japanese residents. In addition, the refugee relief of the "Ejima Maru" is their most urgent responsibility. It is reported that the voluntary donation of righteous money from Japanese residents has reached 621,420 yuan as of yesterday.</p>
<h3>Methods for Potash Alkali Invented; Patent Granted Separately</h3>

<h3>"United Nations Relief" Controls Relief Supplies; China's Share Comparatively Lowest; Director Zheng Baonan Reports on Work Overview</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) At 3 PM yesterday, the Translation Department of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in this city hosted reporters at the Dûsheng Hotel and invited Mr. Zheng Baonan, the recently arrived Director of the Washington D.C. Office of the "ERR", to report.</p>
<p>Relief Supplies Transported to Qingdao</p>
<p>Director Shen first reported that the U.S. will dispatch a U.S. military landing craft to Qingdao, loaded with a large number of relief supplies, including flour, clothing, medicine, and milk powder totaling one thousand tons, which will be distributed to compatriots within the communist controlled areas of Shandong Province. This transport by landing craft is the result of a request by "UNRRA" Director Kasey to the U.S. Army and Navy. Marshal Marshall and General Wedemeyer expressed great sympathy.</p>
<p>Our Country's Share Comparatively Lowest</p>
<p>Director Shen then introduced Mr. Zheng Baonan to report, saying briefly that "UNRRA's" assistance to our country is US$56,250,000, which is US$1.25 per compatriot. In terms of population-weighted average allocation, our country's share is the lowest. He hopes that UNRRA can make adjustments. Mr. Zheng then listed the amounts received by various countries. Even Austria and other former enemy countries have received more than our country. The reasons for the unfair distribution: First, perhaps because there are more "UNRRA" officials of European descent, they inevitably favor European countries; second, because "UNRRA" doubts our country's ability to absorb these materials. In fact, if "UNRRA" could assist our country more with water and land transportation equipment, then absorption and transportation would not be a problem. Mr. Zheng also said that he will go to Henan, Hunan and other areas with the most serious disaster to inspect next week.</p>
<p>Three Principles Requested for Relief</p>
<p>Subsequently, Director Shen and Mr. Zheng answered the questions raised by various reporters. A summary is as follows: (1) On September 19 last year, our country requested US$94,500,000 at the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Conference in London, but because it was decided at that time to provide relief to Germany, Austria and other former enemy countries, it was said that it could be reduced to US$800,000, but the result was not as desired. (2) Countries requesting relief should follow three principles: the extent of losses, the size of the population, and the state of armistice. The European armistice came gradually. As British and American troops advanced, they provided great assistance to the countries in which they were stationed. Taking Italy as an example, it has been given relief worth more than US$500,000,000. Because victory came suddenly to our country, we never received such benefits. (3) All countries intend to postpone the closure of "UNRRA". Our country, because the end of the war was three months later than in Europe, will end at the end of March next year. This matter can be decided at the future United Nations Relief Conference. China hopes to extend it for another six months. (4) Many Chinese people oppose our country renting British ships to transport relief supplies. In fact, these ships fly the United Nations flag, and the British merchants are only providing a service. (5) So far, 31 ships of "UNRRA" supplies have arrived in China, about 135,000 tons, of which 29 ships to Shanghai, one ship to Qingdao, and one ship to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Thugs Hide in Dance Halls, Thirteen Arrested</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The judicial section of the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-Bureau in West Shanghai received a secret report a few days ago that a large number of thugs were hiding in various dance halls on Xizang Road and in the Nanshi area.

They arrested thirteen bandits: Chai Baisheng, Liu Deyun, Wang Henggen, Guo Changgen, Chen Changfa, Chen Guoxiang, Chen Baiqing, Chen Youguan, Zhao Liangui, Qu Zhenghui, Zhao Yunjiang, Yao Qi, and Ding Minghong. They also confiscated one Mauser pistol.

<h3>Pu Zhengdong Reports: Shanghai's Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure; Twenty Billion Spent in Four Months</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government held a weekly memorial service for Sun Yat-sen at 9 AM yesterday. Mayor Qian led the ceremony. Pu Zhengdong, Director of the Finance Bureau, reported on the financial situation of the city since its recovery. Mayor Qian then introduced the newly appointed Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, to the city government colleagues. The main points of Director Pu's report are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai's Revenue and Expenditure Have Never Been Balanced</p>
<p>In summary, Shanghai's fiscal revenue and expenditure have never been balanced. In the past, when revenue and expenditure were insufficient, public bonds were issued and public assets were disposed of to achieve balance. Since the Central Government revised the fiscal revenue and expenditure system in 1943, the business tax, land tax, property rental and sale income tax, deed tax, stamp tax, and inheritance tax, which originally belonged to the local government, were completely transferred to the Central Government. Currently, the local taxes are only entertainment tax, banquet tax, slaughter tax, business license tax, and house tax, totaling five types. This is the only source of funds needed for all administrative and construction work in the city.</p>
<p>Revenue and Expenditure Figures for the Last Four Months</p>
<p>Legal municipal tax revenue was 16.44 million yuan in one week of September last year, 113.62 million yuan in October, 278.79 million yuan in November, 742.1 million yuan in December, and 713.9 million yuan from the beginning of this month to the 24th, totaling 1,864.85 million yuan. The revenue has been increasing month by month. This is only due to continuous improvement of collection methods and does not increase the burden on the people. As for expenditures, they totaled 56.87 million yuan in September last year, 1,007.965 million yuan in October, 1,278.42 million yuan in November, and 1,492.12 million yuan in December, totaling 3,907.07 million yuan. After offsetting the revenue and expenditure, there is a shortfall of approximately 2,004.222 million yuan. In addition to the start-up costs, emergency expenses, and police winter uniform expenses allocated by the Central Government, the administrative expenses, living subsidies, and rice allowances, etc., which originally belonged to the national budget from September to December last year, have not yet been allocated.</p>
<h3>Scavengers Find Shells, Arms and Legs Blown Off</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) At around 3:20 PM yesterday at the entrance of No. 58 Xinmin New Village, Xujiahui, West Shanghai, two child scavengers, Xi Quanfa and Xi Linquan, picked up ten large and small shells somewhere. They first used a hammer to strike one of them, intending to sell it as scrap copper and iron. Unexpectedly, there was a loud explosion, and Quanfa's left arm was blown off and his right hand was injured. Linquan's right leg was blown off. Both fell into a pool of blood, on the verge of death. After the police on duty arrived, they were sent to the First Municipal Hospital in Nanshi. The remaining shells were taken away by the 264th Regiment of the Army to be destroyed.</p>
<h3>He Fengshan Receives All Sectors</h3>
<p>He Fengshan, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, held a cocktail party at No. 23 Daxi Road at 7 PM yesterday to receive all sectors.</p>
<h3>Finance Review Monthly Re-launched Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Sun Notes Stimulate Sentiment, Gold Prices Gradually Rise, US Dollars Rise and Fall with Gold Market</h3>
<p>Because of the reported rise in gold prices in other cities yesterday, and the "Sun Note" stimulated confidence, major dealers in the industry planned to launch a squeeze, and the buying momentum was strong for a time. However, spot US dollars were sold off, and the spread widened to over 640 yuan. The gold market was supplied with short covering, making it difficult for the rising trend to be sustained. Credit was extremely tight. At noon, the floating longs were forced to sell off, turning into a slight decline. The morning opened and rose to 915,000, and buyers came one after another. People in the industry also joined forces to buy, rising to around 960,000 after opening. At this time, the US dollar market did not show any uptrend, which caused a wave of short selling. Although there was a small rebound, there was a lot of struggle along the way. Near noon, the floating longs sold off. At noon, due to lack of credit, it succumbed to below 940,000. In the afternoon, there were not many spot transactions. The next-day delivery opened and once rose to 953,000. The continued weakness of the US dollar affected sentiment. Finally, it was still around 945,000. As a result, compared with last Saturday, the spot price rose by 38,000, the price of gold jewelry in jewelry stores rose to 1,000,020, silver rose to 850 yuan, silver dollars rose to 530 yuan, and the discount rate fell from one dime to one dime and four cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars were sold off in large quantities. Due to doubts about whether cash can be used for final payments, merchants have been hesitant. The morning opening was stimulated by the gold market, rising to 1,460 yuan. It initially hovered, and was then affected by the sharp rise in the gold market, causing arbitrage buying (the spread against gold widened to 645 yuan per ten taels), rising to 1,480 yuan. After the gold price fell back, it also fell to a slightly stronger 1,460 yuan at noon. Spot goods from the QianDui industry were oversupplied. As a result, it rose by 15 yuan compared with last Saturday. Hong Kong dollar was initially stimulated by the gold market, with both new and old goods slightly higher, but old goods were less speculative and inferior to new goods. However, the high price could not be sustained. Compared with last Saturday, both new and old were flat.</p>
<h3>Major Players Use Tactics, Public Bonds See Another Surge</h3>
<p>Since public bonds were absorbed at low prices last Saturday, they have shown signs of waiting for an opportunity to move. Yesterday, a report said that "Sun Notes" would be issued soon, so they used it as much as possible and tried their best to push up the price. In a semi-true and semi-false state, the opening price of Class C fell to 1,650 yuan. Major players bought them together, using squeeze and tactics simultaneously. The asking price was raised in one go, soaring to over 1,950 yuan. The bulls were satisfied and stopped. Then came a round of unloading and short selling. Under the dual pressure, it plunged more than 400 yuan in an instant, falling back to 1,500 yuan. After that, there were frequent fluctuations. The views of major players and retail investors differed. It first rose to above 1,800, and then fell to within 1,700 yuan at noon due to time constraints. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Class A and B each rose by 310 yuan, Class C rose by 370 yuan, Class D rose by 330 yuan, and Class E rose by 370 yuan.</p>
<h3>Speculation Takes Advantage of Rumors, Chinese Stocks Progress Steadily</h3>
<p>Before the fake currency capital was fully organized, Chinese stocks received news of the imminent issuance of "Sun Notes". Regardless of the source of the news, speculators used it to the fullest. Wing On Spinning opened at 1,800 yuan, and American Asia at 12,400 yuan. But at this time, because the news was urgent, the asking price was intermittent. After entering the market, credit was tight, and a part of them had to sell the purchased gold to prepare for settlement, so there was a slight decline. However, there was a lot of fluctuation along the way. Wing On Spinning and American Asia each fell back by about 100 yuan from the peak. Until the noon closing, it still fluctuated. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Wing On Spinning and American Asia each rose by 130 yuan, Xinhe and China Textile each rose by 30 yuan, and the three small popular stocks each rose by about 10%. Unpopular stocks also made progress due to their low prices and high demand.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were stimulated by stocks and bonds and rose passively, so they were not as brilliant as stocks and bonds, but the process was extremely stable and there was not much backlash. Until the noon closing, compared with last Saturday, Yispin yarn and papermaking and other medium-sized stocks each rose by more than 200 yuan. Jardine Matheson failed to prosper because of its high price and high cost. Rubber stocks were deserted.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Soar Again: Spinners and Builders Will Not Sell Off Within the Year</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw a sudden surge. The rumors about the "Sun Bonds" (likely referring to a currency or financial instrument) reported in newspapers greatly boosted confidence. Fellow traders and individual investors frantically bought up yarn. With a severe shortage of ready stock in various factories, prices skyrocketed. 16-count and 20-count yarn rose by 50,000 (currency units), while finer yarn increased by 70,000 to 80,000 (currency units). At noon, the Spinning and Building Company announced that it would no longer sell off yarn within the year, further strengthening the bullish trend.</p>
<h3>Raw Material Allocation Too Small: Silk Fabrics All Rise in Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in over-the-counter trading of rayon, the highest price for No. 120 Tianqiao brand ready stock was 1,230,000 (currency units), and the lowest was 1,200,000 (currency units). Warehouse receipts were priced at 800,000 to 810,000 (currency units), an increase of 80,000 to 90,000 (currency units) compared to the weekend. This was mainly due to the first allocation of raw materials being too small. Factories did not have enough to meet demand, and actual sales were still strong. Factory managers, after a period of inactivity, became eager to act, and the cost of goods arriving increased sharply. All dealers raised their prices in unison. Intermediate grade rayon required a price of over 1,500,000 (currency units). The market for silk fabrics remained active, and selling prices followed suit. Meiya quilt covers were priced at 850,000 (currency units) per hundred, Dacheng Gebi crepe at 2,800 (currency units) per yard, and Minsheng brocade at 12,000 (currency units) per piece.</p>
<h3>Cotton Transactions Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market remained firm. Chinese yarn factories purchased 42-count raw material American cotton Middling grade at 62,000 (currency units). Also, 32-count raw material Sanyu Zhen fine cotton at 63,500 (currency units). The above prices were all delivered to the factory. Cotton brokers purchased 16-count raw material Huoji cotton at 44,000 (currency units). Also, Zhoupu cottonseed was offered at 9,000 (currency units) and 9,200 (currency units). The above prices were all warehouse delivery prices.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Merchants Reluctant to Release Stock</h3>
<p>With news of the issuance of "Sun Bonds" spreading throughout the market, and gold prices rising previously, those holding goods generally held the view that goods were more valuable than currency. They were reluctant to release their stock. Coupled with the thin inventory of finished products, the cloth market showed signs of gradually rising.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Soar, Edible Oil Rises Most Sharply</h3>
<p>The rice market experienced a surge in prices due to rainy weather and the approaching end of the year, resulting in a gradual decrease in supply. Shopkeepers needed to stock up for the upcoming holiday closure, leading to strong real demand. Both粳 (jīng, japonica rice) and 秈 (xiān, indica rice) rice varieties increased by 300 to 400 (currency units). Flour prices also rose by another 300 to 400 (currency units) due to scarce supply and brisk retail sales. Soybeans were exceptionally popular, continuing to rise by 500 to 600 (currency units). The oil market also saw a massive surge of 6,000 to 7,000 (currency units) due to the large number of shopkeepers stocking up for the year-end. Soybean cakes followed suit, increasing by 100 to 200 (currency units). The liquor market remained firm and stable.</p>
<p>Rice Market to Close Tomorrow: According to the person in charge of the Provisional Rice Market, the market will close after completing its work today, as the end of the year is approaching. Trading will resume on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year in the coming spring.</p>
<h3>Fiscal Year-End Approaching: Tea Market Transactions Decrease</h3>
<p>With the fiscal year-end of 1945 approaching for all industries, tea merchants must also conduct their annual accounting as usual. As a result, both buyers and sellers are unwilling to make transactions. Only occasional transactions involve small retail customers needing cash for adjustments. Therefore, there are very few transactions, and the market is quite calm. Market prices lack significant fluctuations and remain stable. According to news from Tianjin, there is a strong demand for Dafang green tea, and the overall trend will become active again after the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Stagnant: Firewood and Charcoal Inevitably Soften Towards Year-End</h3>
<p>Coal market transactions are few and far between, and stagnant. Most coal merchants are temporarily closing down as the end of the year approaches. Unless there is a real sales channel, most are unwilling to purchase more stock. Sales of white coal lumps are slow, and prices continue to fall. White coal dust, however, is selling well due to brisk sales of coal briquettes. Fellow traders have substantial inventories, and prices have rebounded somewhat. Small firewood and charcoal vendors have had difficulty selling due to the rain. Holders of the goods are eager to convert them into cash to return home, and can only sell them off cheaply. But suitable buyers are lacking.</p>
<h3>Timber Market Prices Firm and Strong: Doubled in November</h3>
<p>Yesterday's timber market, even at the end of the year, remained firm and strong. Liuan plywood and pine boards were actively sought after, and prices repeatedly hit new records, doubling since November.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>Jiang 海關 現奉總稅務司通知即日起凡金條及任何金塊，一律 禁止出關，如有旅客往東北各地，所携飾金，亦規定限量，超過者應在 海關自行設法安置，並視情形，得暫予扣留，以一月為限期，滿後即予沒收。The Jiang 海關 (Customs) has received a notice from the Inspector General of Customs that, effective immediately, gold bars and any gold nuggets are strictly prohibited from leaving the country.

<h3>Beijing-Lin University Detained Students Scheduled for Trial Tomorrow: Wang Shulin Declares No Private Suit Filed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing 28th Dispatch] The eight students detained at Beijing-Lin University are scheduled for trial on the 30th. The class advisor, Wang Shulin, and the Beijing Youth League Secretary, Huang Tong, have requested the court to expedite the trial. The detained students have been on a hunger strike for four days. It is rumored that this case may be resolved with a lenient sentence.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing 28th Dispatch] The local court has scheduled a hearing for the detained Beijing-Lin University students on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Special Report] The expelled students from the Capital Provisional University Preparatory Class, for causing trouble, have been deemed criminally suspicious by the Capital District Court Prosecutor's Office. Eight students, including Yu Baiqing, have been detained. The prosecutor has completed the investigation and, in accordance with Articles 136 and 302 of the Criminal Procedure Law, has filed a public prosecution on charges of obstructing official duties and freedom. The prosecutor's office has concluded its responsibility. The case will now be handled by a judge in the criminal court. Although a public prosecution has been filed, whether or not a crime has been committed remains to be seen, pending a court hearing. The eight detained students reportedly began a hunger strike upon hearing the news. As a result, some members of the so-called 121 Student Association did not attend classes on the 25th, and went around appealing for the release of the arrested students. The court is about to hold a hearing on this case. What follows is an account of actual observations and interviews with various parties:</p>
<p>From the School's Perspective</p>
<p>When our reporter visited the Beijing-Lin University Preparatory Class on the 26th, notices were posted on the walls at the entrance, declaring a hunger strike by the detained students, including Yu Baiqing, and appealing for help from fellow students and the public. As a result, some members of the so-called 121 Student Association did not attend classes on the 25th and went around appealing for help. However, a visit to the classrooms showed that most students were in class. When the class was initially established, those in charge thought that the preparatory class would be very simple. They planned to open a class with 50 students and offer general subjects as a remedial program. Unexpectedly, the number of students increased, and courses from all departments of the university were prepared in haste. The class advisor recruited many outstanding professors from Chongqing, Shanghai, and inland areas (such as the former well-known scholar of the Science Society, Sun Hongfen, whom the reporter happened to meet and learned that he was a professor in the Chemical Engineering Department of the class). This has been a challenging task.</p>
<p>From the Professor's Perspective</p>
<p>According to the class advisor, Wang Shulin, the previous student disturbance was due to the English exam papers, but the biggest demand came from students from the former puppet Central University who wanted to be assigned to the formal Central University after completing their preparatory studies. Frankly speaking, if they were allowed these conditions, no matter how much they suffered, there would be no problem. This matter is not something that the Ministry of Education can handle, as there is no such procedure. Even Central University itself is facing difficulties because the former school buildings could only accommodate 2,000 students, but the number of students has now increased to 4,500. It cannot be said that the doors of Central University are closed tightly, preventing people from entering, but it is not something that can be forced open. If students can work very hard in class and their grades are excellent, many of the professors here are from Central University, and they can sense which students are good and make fair judgments. Perhaps there will be an opportunity to enter Central University. I cannot deceive or perfunctorily promise students something that I cannot do myself, falsely promising students that they can enter Central University. It depends on whether they do well. As for the detained students, he did not file a lawsuit, nor did he file a private suit. It was entirely the prosecutor who believed that the students had obstructed official duties and freedom, and considered them to be criminally suspicious. The prosecutor filed the public prosecution. Wang also sent a letter to the court expressing leniency and forgiveness towards the students. Since he did not file a complaint, he could not comply with the students' request to bail them out in his personal capacity. The students can think of their own ways and apply for bail according to the law.</p>
<p>From the Ministry of Education's Perspective</p>
<p>According to relevant authorities, the Ministry of Education's role in rectifying academic affairs is limited to completing the procedures for expelling students. The students were detained for assaulting the class advisor, and the trial is a legal matter for the court. Judicial independence means that the Ministry of Education has no right to interfere in legal proceedings. As for the request for bail, the students can apply for it according to the law, and the court will review the application.</p>
<p>From the Court's Perspective</p>
<p>Upon learning of the hunger strike by the detained students, the President of the Capital District Court, Wang, specially sent the Chief Clerk, Tu Huai Li, to visit the students at the detention center at 11:00 AM on the 26th. He conveyed President Wang's concern for the youth, stating that the matter would proceed according to legal channels, and that the trial would be held soon. He advised the students to eat as usual. (One report stated that the students were not on a hunger strike.) He also said that the hunger strike was meaningless, and that the court was not responsible for it, nor could it be used to coerce the court. The discussion lasted for two hours. The students also expressed that the warden of the detention center was treating the youth well. It is reported that the court will hold a hearing on this case soon, and the trial will be open to the public. According to regulations, if Director Wang has sent a letter to the court expressing leniency, and the court considers that the youth blindly violated the law, the court may rule in favor of leniency, as the law cannot be abandoned, but the circumstances are understandable. It is speculated that the trial will result in a lenient sentence. It is expected that the trial will be held around the 20th of this month. It is also reported that a preliminary investigation will be conducted first, followed by a three-judge panel (three judges will be present simultaneously) to ensure thoroughness. (Fool)</p>

<h3>President of Guangxi University, Li Yunhua, Goes to Chongqing to Request Instructions from the Ministry of Education on Restoration Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Guilin Dispatch] Li Yunhua, the president of Guangxi University, went to Chongqing a few days ago. It is reported that the purpose of this trip is twofold: (1) The university originally planned to have 600 student slots, but due to the restoration of transportation, the number of people coming from various places has exceeded 1,000, which is significantly different from the original budget. He plans to ask the Ministry of Education for additional funding. (2) Most of the school buildings in Guilin were destroyed, and reconstruction is not easy. Although classes have started in Liuzhou, the school buildings are made of bamboo sheds, which only provide shelter from the wind and rain. Therefore, some people advocate moving to the original site in Wuzhou. This also needs to be decided by the Ministry of Education. (Si)</p>
