<h3>遠都在即辭別川同胞　蔣主席由渝飛抵蓉　中央各部首長續到京</h3>

<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕中央組織部副部長余井塘，僑委會委員長陳樹人，社會部長谷正綱，今由渝乘還都專機抵京，中央黨部秘書長吳鐵城改明日飛京，組織部長陳立夫定廿七日來京，考試院長戴季陶定廿八日還都。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿四日電〕薛篤弼段錫鵬葉秀峯三氏，前日自渝飛京過漢，因飛機發生故障，在此滯留一日，今晨十時，已相偕飛京，同行者尙有農林部次長嚴愼予等。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕今還都機續載來蘇聯大使館人員十一人，法國大使館十人，聞蘇大使彼得洛夫因京寓尙未布置就緒，稍緩來京，比駐華大使德爾富，定下月初由津來京。</p>
<p>〔中失肚重慶廿五日電〕中央黨政軍機關留渝聯合辦事處，今在軍委會成立，該處主任爲朱紹良·副主任許孝炎·陳克文，今後黨政軍機關留渝人員，即受該處統一指揮，一俟中央機關還都完畢，該處即當撤銷。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕財政部長兪鴻鈞，糧食部長徐堪，昨日下午四時，由京飛抵此間，記者在機塲晤兪氏，即詢關於中美貸款進行情形及貸款數額，兪氏笑謂，尙未到發表時期，聞兪氏在滬將有一短時期勾留，以便處理本市金融財政事務。昨日與兪氏等同機來滬者，有交通銀行董事長錢新之，中國農民銀行總經理兪叔明等。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾日內飛京　今後國共會談將在京舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕重慶訊：馬歇爾可能於廿七日飛京，座機已至渝迎候。又今午重慶電台曾電詢南京氣象，京市遂盛傳馬帥將於下午四時抵京，後知非確，但據麥克魯將軍談：馬使確擬於廿七日飛京。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿五日電〕政府已通知中共，今後會議須在南京舉行，同時馬歇爾特使繼續會晤各黨派領袖，今晨曾與民主同盟主要人士商談，惟軍事三人小組日內不致開會，馬氏等三委員，或將於本週杪赴京後再行會議。馬氏方面，並無會談進展之消息傳出，已託人轉言，彼無消息可吿報界。中共發言人稱：彼相信即使對解決東北問題商獲協議，現已佔領長春及包圍哈爾濱之共軍，亦「不願將該兩城交予中央政府」。中共現仍要求以東北停戰，爲談判有關政府改組及整編軍隊等政治爭執之代價，如果停戰命令頒布，兩軍保持現狀，則東北境內中共已佔一百區，國軍僅佔二十區，國民黨欲得哈長兩城，唯有出兵爭奪一途。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿五日電〕此間盛傳馬歇爾特使與國共代表再度會談時，國府方面將尤其軍控制東北某數區域，惟必須退出長春，亦不得進佔哈爾濱與龍江（齊齊哈爾）。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕杜魯門總統駐華特使馬歇爾，目下第一任務乃在制止東北戰事，其第二任務則將勸吿國共雙方，共同遵守政治協商會議所通過之決議。據重慶消息中央對五月五日在南京召開之國民大會，已允展期，此乃對於中共方面重大讓步，局勢因已相當和緩，聞中央對東北問題亦準備妥協。中共如拒絕參加國民大會，則馬歇爾特使之計劃，將受嚴重挫折。觀於馬氏此次偕夫人返任，足見其有在華久居之意，而馬氏決心使中國團結一致，鞏固和平基礎，亦可於此窺見一斑。</p>
<h3>搶修黃河橋</h3>
<p>平漢路局全力進行</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿五日電〕據悉：平漢鐵路局現正集中力量搶修黃河鐵橋，全部工程需費六千萬元，已由路局墊付，務期於黃水泛濫前竣工。又粤漢全綫搶修工程，正繼續進行，武昌至曲江段，下月一日可正式恢復火車行駛，（現僅通便車）全綫通車，當在七月一日以前。</p>
<h3>石家莊決改市</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕石家莊決改設石門市，首任市畏爲尹文長，尹已派員到石，積極籌備中。</p>
<h3>蘇聯自東北搬走機器　價值五萬萬美元　延安廣播公然代爲掩飾　東北生產管理局在瀋正式成立</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿五日電〕據甫從東北返京之美鑛務專家估計，蘇聯已從東北運去機器，至少價値五萬萬美元，中國欲補充此等機器，最少需時兩年。美專家係代表國際聞名之某公司，來華調査鑛藏，報吿中國資源委員會。彼等在東九省南部時，見工業區已被拆運一空，僅撫順一區機器悉被拆下，裝火車絡鐸運往西伯利亞，先後已達二千二百輛之多。除非東北恢復和平，否則該處廣大地區將於中國毫無價値，目前交通因戰爭而阻斷，致運輸非常困難。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋踢廿五日電〕據延安廿一日廣播新華社消息謂：「瀋陽全市工廠共有千八百餘家，一切設備均完好無缺，未曾遭受損害，可知國民黨當局叫囂蘇軍破壞工廠與運走機器等純係製造事實」，瀋陽人士收聽延安此項廣播後，無不憤慨異常，認延安方面眞爲白日說夢，淆亂黑白，瀋市工廠被搬遷一空，乃係鐵的事實，中外共知，美英各國且曾爲此事向蘇聯提出照會，凡到達瀋陽之中外記者，包括新華社及解放報之記者在內，均曾赴鐵西參觀各工廠，僅餘空殼，乃係有目共睹，即使蘇方亦對此事予以承認，而不加掩飾，不料延安公然對此事加以遮掩，其用心回測，可以想見。</p>
<p>〔又電〕東北行營經委會東北生產管理局，廿四日晨在瀋正式成立，並設一理事會，由經委會代理副主委王家楨代理理事長兼管理局長，王氏表示：（一）希望東北生產計劃能與關內配合，（二）東北工業復員工作艱巨，接收後，希望各方本堅毅不拔精神，事權分明，使工業不但復員，並可蒸蒸日上。（三）利用日本技術人員，選拔本國精良專家，在短期內完成復員計劃。</p>
<h3>浙全省鐵路月內可修復</h3>
<p>〔本報枕州廿五日電〕浙贛路現由杭通至諸曁。株州，萍鄕，南昌，九江兩段積極復軌，南昌上饒段衢州，金華段有橋樑十餘座俱遭澈底破壞，一時修復不易，江山至衢州，諸曁至金華較易修復，枕木尙多，路軌缺乏，中樞定月內將浙省之鐵路全部修復。</p>
<h3>東北蓋章法幣將予提前收回</h3>
<p>〔木報北平廿五日電〕東北長官部所發蓋章法幣，前經財部決定於十八個月內收回，茲東北關係方面，請求財部於三個月至半年內收回，聞已獲准。</p>
<h3>行總展開救濟工作　蘇省設六工作隊　鄂救濟工作正積極加强</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿五日電〕行總蘇寗分署爲全面展開救濟工作，除決定京滬沿綫各縣救濟工作，直接辦理外，並於各重要地區設立六個據點工作隊，主持救濟事宜。（一）徐州隊轄豐沛蕭碭邳銅睢宿等八縣。（二）海州隊轄運雲東贛灌漣沭泗等七縣市。（三）泰州隊轄鹽阜興東泰等六縣。（四）揚州隊轄揚淮淮高實議等六縣。（五）南通隊轄通如雲啓靖等五縣。（六）上海隊轄上松南靑鎭奉寳川嘉崇等十縣。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿五日電〕本報記者今訪鄂救濟分署署長周蒼柏，據談：鄂省救濟工作，近正積極加强，自五月份起運漢物資每日有二千噸，合計每月可有六萬噸，爲救濟鄂北災區，自下月起決以卡車百五十輛專運物資前往該區。至由漢濟湘物資，自五月起每日亦可達五百噸，將來或更有增加。此外，本署貸與鄂省修堤工糧，已逾六千噸，近以宜昌翟亂流行，死亡達六十餘人，爲防止災害擴大，已派員携帶大批藥品前往施救。就目前情形言，運漢物資已不虞缺乏，所感困難者爲倉庫太少，儲存不易，而由漢運往各災區之運費，月需二十億元，亦尙無適當解決。</p>
<h3>國府命令</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿五日電〕國民政府廿五日令：特派駐秘魯國特命全體大使保君建，爲互換中厄友好條約批准的本全體代表，此令。</p>
<h3>司令長春　（下）</h3>
<p>— 方仁寄於瀋陽</p>
<p>長春如此，其北松花江上的名城哈爾濱，嫩江省府所在地，位於哈爾濱西北，嫩江流經其地的齊齊哈爾，又是怎麽樣呢？用不着說，那情形是四面受敵，主席市長們只有在接收了的衙門中厮混。這樣說並不算刻薄，單是接收了衙門的市長主席們，他們權力所及的範圍，實在不及關內有些地方的一個小小保長乃至甲長。據接近松江省主席關吉玉哈爾濱市長楊綽庵的人說：關楊兩人在以往都沒有嗜好，而現在他們兩人都喜歡抽紙烟，尤其是關吉玉氏—他一向是一位較爲拘謹的人，在那種環境中，他內心的感覺，恐怕只有他個人感覺得最爲深切，或者在他周圍同深陷於說不來的一種境地中的人，少許能明白一點個中况味。哈爾濱和長春間的消息，還算比較　通，掛一個長送電話，假使綫路未遭破壞，縱然在通話時經常有人干擾，發出許多雜聲，尤以在兩地交換消息時爲甚，但總可以在糢糊中聽得一些消息。加以火車除非爲軍運佔用不售客票外，南北兩地的人總可以對流，在口訊中彼此終可以交換一些消息。德惠雙城固然有來歷不明的隊伍，檢查過往的行人。但人總歸是有辦法的，檢査員並非個個精明强幹，而齊齊哈爾就不然，嫩江省府自同松江省府在一月八日離開了長春之後，在哈爾濱逗留了不幾天，彭濟羣主席便率接收人員到了齊齊哈爾。那裏的消息，一直令人感到閉塞，住在長春的人所感如此，想關內各地當更感到茫然。</p>
<p>記者於廿九日，因了事實上的需要，離開了寂寞，單調，缺乏生氣，使人感到窒息，而表現得頗不寧靜的長春。當記者離開時，除隨時將隨馬林諾夫斯基元帥到哈爾濱工作的軍事代表團董彥平團長等之外，留在那兒的，人數已極寥寥。以單位而言：滿炭大樓負責人有吳士瑜賴秉權兩少將，長春市政府有裏趙君邁等，中央銀行長春分行有經理韋夢齡等，而記者的同行只有中央社記者劉竹舟一人。</p>
<p>吳士瑜賴秉權兩位都是江西老表，一位管交通，一位管總務，去年十二月再回長春時，這兩方面的工作，差不多由他們兩人分担。長春市府同中央銀行長春分行這兩個機關，在所謂東北僵局打開之後，他倆是開東北各地接收工作先聲的同命鴛鴦。他們同在去年十二月廿二日着手接收，道消息傳出之後，曾使許多縐着眉頭的人爲之欣然色喜，也鼓舞了瀋陽哈爾濱各地接收工作的人，積極展開了接收工作。趙市長君　曾留學美國，硏究軍事，過去當過衡陽市長，當他在衡陽時，正是抗戰史上煊赫一時衡陽保　戰發生的時候。所以，他當風聲緊急時，曾表示他對於這樣的塲面，並不感覺到陌生，遇必要時，他照樣可以指揮應付。　經理夢齡，在記者離長春前幾天，爲了安定他的工作人員和市民的心，他由滿炭大樓遷居中央銀行。人們在謠言蠭起時，銀行彷彿特別受人注意，因此，謠言往往以銀行作爲材料，而韋經理遷住銀行以後，表示出他的決心，使謠言製造者自已感到沒趣。中央社在長春工作的原有三位，攝影記者宣文傑因轉瀋陽工作，所以長春只留下記者劉竹舟鍾鶴年兩人，他們曾以打字機印發新聞稿，使長春各報獲得新聞的供應，因此，長春的報紙就不像哈爾濱各地的那樣，顯得雜亂無章，登些不是新聞的新聞。他們辦公時間總在上午九點到下午四點，長春最能在各處走走的時間，全都在這一段中，而他們差不多全消磨在辦公室裏。有許多人在長春學會了跳舞，但他們却沒時間在那些地方去走走。廿九日，鍾君鶴年因公離長，結果只有劉君竹舟一人孤軍塵戰，劉君決心堅持到底，他在寫給瀋陽一位朋友的雷中曾表示：他「願意戰至最後一彈（紙彈）」。</p>
<p>記者離長後的第三天，四月一日夜裏，長春西邪便發生了戰事！市內電燈又忽然滅掉。接着情勢一天緊急一天，蘇軍於十四日撤退長春，長春前途如何，惟有等待事實答覆。記者以懷念的心情，願長春以及長春的友人無恙！</p>
<h3>京徵調日俘服役完成市郊六公路</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕本市徵調服役之日俘一萬二千餘人，將於五月一日遺送回國，此批日俘，屬敵軍第四十師團，自本年二月起調服勞役，計完成市郊環湖，百果山，太（平門）堯（化門），堯燕（子　）和（半門）燕，下（關）燕等六條公路，市內漢中莫愁及光華門（至飛機塲等三條幹路之修復工程，計長四四·一公里，趕築美軍停車塲及陸軍總部下水道等工程兩起，此外並有秦淮河疏濬工程等多處，除秦淮河外，各項工程均已告一段落。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕各地運送集結本市之日俘一萬二千餘，京滬路局刻正準備車輛，定自五月一日起分批運滬。</p>
<h3>趙家驤返抵瀋陽　據稱主席關切東北現局矚須靜待調處途徑解決</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕東北戰事在四平街公主嶺間激烈進行，東北保安長官部參謀長趙家驤，廿五日晨專機飛瀋陽，趙氏稱：渠抵渝後，廿三日午晉謁蔣主席時，主席對東北局勢垂詢甚詳，惟對東北軍事未多所表示，主席之意，東北現局須靜待調處途徑解決，並囑本人向東北各主管人轉達此意，不可輕動。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿五日電〕趙家驤廿五日由平飛抵瀋，據稱：蔣主席對東北局勢極爲嗣切，對東北同胞異常繫念。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕北平訊：瀋陽以北之公主嶺，國共兩軍已展開惡戰，新一軍後續部隊已到達，平新華分社所傳新一軍三十一師副師長受傷說，不確。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿五日電〕報載，新一軍之「突擊隊」，衝破公主嶺共軍之堅强防綫，正向長春推進中，此後數日內，即可到達長春。</p>
<h3>中宣部長吳國楨表示　蘇軍應退出大連　馬林諾夫斯基已離哈爾濱</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿五日電〕宣傳部長吳國楨今日表示，極盼蘇軍於本月內退出大連，據稱：關於大連情勢，彼並無消息，東北蘇軍撤退日期中，並未列入大連，「然大連乃中國一部份疆土，吾人盼望蘇軍依照諾言，於月內退出東北全境」。至於哈爾濱，已失於中共，「共軍業已在哈爾濱市區內」。蘇軍係定今日退出哈埠，惟至今晚爲止，國府尙未知蘇軍已否如期撤退。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿五日電〕有資格中外方面人士今日稱：現駐東九省東南部之蘇軍部隊，係由北韓之紅軍最高司令部所管轄，並不包括在馬林諾夫斯基元帥所定四月底前撤出東北之計劃以內，駐在大連之紅軍部隊，亦可能如此。彼等對所謂東九省東南區之切實界限，朱能詳悉，彼等並指謂：東九省東南部及大連，皆隣近鴨綠江北岸地區，該處乃駐韓蘇軍之後方屛障，據稱：該區蘇軍之撤退，有賴於未來之中蘇談判。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿五日電〕今日爲蘇軍完全撤離哈爾濱之日期，惟此間自昨晚與該地通電後，迄今尙未再接哈埠電訊，蘇軍是否撤盡，尙未知悉。惟據推測，我軍事代表團或已離開哈埠，馬林諾夫斯基元帥係廿四日離哈，我軍事代表團及地方人員未同去。</p>
<p>〔法新聞社瀋陽廿五日電〕據撤退來此之政府官員稱：共軍已在哈埠附近各村莊樹立政權，並已於數月以前潛入市內，現正準備一俟蘇軍撤盡，接收全市行政。政府軍隊現仍在哈爾濱西南約二百廿英哩處，與四平街一帶中共軍衝突中。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿五日電〕北平共產黨方面人士今日預料：哈爾濱將由共產黨之「自衛軍」接收。蘇軍預定今日開始撤離哈爾濱，大致將於明日竣事。哈市周國各城及郊外據點包托其現代大飛機塲在內，已人共產軍之手，但截止昨日，名義上之控制仍屬蘇軍。同時，齊齊哈爾之政府接收人員，鑒於蘇軍撤退後，共產軍可能即行加以接收業已前往威爾濱，準備轉赴瀋陽。國共雙方人士先前均稱：哈爾濱市長楊綽庵曾與哈市周圍之共產軍作一嘗試性質之君子協定，由渠繼續任市長，而由共產黨任命一副市長，共同維持哈市之和平與秩序。最近消息並未透露楊氏是否仍守此項協定，繼續担任市長，抑正設法脫離哈爾濱有如其他政府官吏然。</p>
<h3>調處部遭逢困難　執行小組工作陷於停頓</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕執行部政府方面副參謀長鈕先銘，改定廿六日飛瀋，政府新派定之瀋陽中心小組組長蔡宗濂隨行。據稱：妨行部第卅一小組已赴永年工作，外傳增派第卅一小組赴東北不確，因瀋陽尙留一第卅小組候補備用也。瀋陽中心小組政府組長木爲趙家驤，因趙爲保安長官部參謀長，事務甚忙，故改由蔡宗濂繼任，蔡係新由南京調來。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿五日電〕參加北平調處執行部工作之政府，共黨與美方人員，在彼等與合衆社記者分別舉行之談話中，均承認彼等結東內戰整編軍隊之任務目前已無法推進。執行小組約三十隊，刻分布于中國各地，南起海南島，北迄四平街，但北平執行總部中充滿停頓空氣，靜待重慶方面之發展。執行總部今日所遭過之重要困難如下：（一）由於重慶方面對新衝突無法制止，（二）派往東北之執行小組陷於痺麻狀態，（三）修復被毀鐵路無法成立協定，（四）華北許多城市之圍困無法解除。執行總部中有美方人員六百三十三人，最近可能增至一千人左右。目下執行總部渴望自重慶主腦方面獲得新生命，以期完成其任務。</p>
<h3>物資建設計劃經會擬定預算</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿五日電〕據悉，戰後五年物資建設計劃，最高經濟委員會業已擬定預算爲二百二十億基金，籌集辦法，聞採取二種方式，（一）國外投資與借款，（二）政府與人民投資。</p>

<h3>潘公展等招待　留滬國大代表　徵詢國大延期意見</h3>
<p>中委潘公展，中華海員特別黨部主任委員楊嘯天，及上海市黨部主任委員吳紹對三氏，以國民大會爲期已近，爲聯絡感情，幷徵詢對于憲草及當前各種問題之意見起見，特于日前發出請柬，邀請各留滬國大代表，于昨日下午三時，假新生活俱樂部，舉行茶會。留滬國大代表何元明，汪企張，劉芷黨，胡靖安，潘炳卿，牛敬亭，丁仲英，奚玉書，朱鳳蔚，于懷仁，陳冠英，陳朝岫，唐承宗，唐奇，王寄一，陳霆銳，祝兆奎，秦聯奎葉翔臯，王人麟，周學湘，朱學範等二十餘人均應邀蒞臨。首由楊嘯天吳紹澍分別致詞說明招待意義旨在徵詢對于憲草意見，因憲草爲未來國家根本大法，此次國民大會，會期極短，欲產生一部完善之憲法各代表必須在會前多多交換意見，同時對于議程提案，亦須多作準備，今大會雖已延期，但準備工作，仍須加緊進行云云。各代表旋即紛紛發表意見，中心論點，均集中在延期召開國大一點。奚玉書以爲政府對於召開國民大會實施憲政早具誠意五月五日之會期，上年即已決定，且已正式發出通知，現竟因少數黨派未提出代表名單而再度延期，殊表遺憾。潘公展認爲國大雖已延期但召開日期，必不致過遠，我等可先至南京準備開會集中硏討憲草問題。此外，唐奇，王寄一，陳冠英，劉芷薰等均有意見發表。歸納各方意見，均一致主張以國大聯誼會名義，電詢中央何故延期，並延至何時舉行，同時對于共產黨及民主同盟等少數黨派無誠意參加國大，亦希望有所表示。最後決定將各人發表之意見，提交國大聯誼會再作討論，直至五時半始散。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>解決勞資糾紛之途徑</h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>生產之要素有三：土地以外，勞動與資本並稱重心。當此民生凋敝，建設開始之際，而勞資糾紛相纓不解，誠生產事業之不幸也。按此種糾紛，以工資問題爲焦點，各方面屢屢以互諒與協調相勸勉。然而勞方資方情詞各執，一方稱物價高漲，所得工炎不足以維持開支，而另一方稱成本太高，已無法負担其廠繳，於是勸者自勸，爭者自爭。然則工資標準之硏究，確成爲目前之嚴重問題。經濟學者有恒言，經濟事情當以經濟政策解決之。勞資之配合，與工資之標準，原爲生產論與分配論中之要義，我人似可於此硏究其解決之途徑。</p>
<p>工資又稱勞銀，其數目應如何規定，學者不一其說。綜其大要，可得左列數種：</p>
<p>（一）生產費說主此說者，謂勞動對於生產物，能增加其若干價値，即可作爲工資之標準，而生產物之價値，常因市塲之競爭而變動其價格，則工資亦不得不隨之而升降。今之美國，其物價與工資，均仍在政府管理之中，每逢工資提升，其生產指數與製品售價，輒亦相當提高，蓋即根據此說也。惟有須注意者，如政府管制未能十分嚴密，則當利潤大增之時，其工資未必能等量增加；反之，如利潤下落，或甚至虧本，除歇業以外，勞働者亦未必能照數退讓，是故理論雖美、，實行亦頗困難。</p>
<p>（二）最低生活費說古有所謂勞銀鐵則者（Iron　LawOf　Wages），謂人口日增，工資日低，勞働者之所得，必降至勉能維持其最低生活費爲止。此說在事實上，似不相符。蓋就各國之統計而言，除產業衰落，勞働過剩外，一般工資要在漸漸增加之中也。惟勞工至無法維持其最低之生活時，勢必另尋生計，而不能安於其業，自屬情理之常。故研究社會政策者，輒主張政府應另加救濟，以免其失所。蓋此種責任，固非殘破之生產事業界所能負担也。</p>
<p>（三）基金說　學者有所謂勞銀基金說者（Wages　FundTbeory），指在同一社會之同一時期中，生產界所能負祖之勞銀總數，即爲全體勞働取給工資之基金，此蓋與生產費說根據同一之原理者。主張此說者，每謂勞働者欲求其工資之增加，應先减少其參加勞働之人數。但我人應知如勞働之技術無進步，則人數减少，生產退步，其勞働基金亦必隨之而减少。工人團體或以防止新工人加入爲自衛，其結果亦未必有利。</p>
<p>（四）限界說限界者（Marginal　Prinoiple），謂經濟中之各個單位，應各保持其相當之差益也。故消費者有餘剩（Coosomer＇s　Surplus），節約者有餘剩（Saver＇s　Surplus），生產者有餘剩（Producet＇s　Surplus）。根據此說，勞方炎方，應均能保持相當之餘剩，且均能得到相當之保障。但此可爲產業順調者言，不能爲虧本而减削廠繳者談。如欲調劑此弊，凡生產事業如有過分之盈利者，政府應課以重稅，以備救濟他業或他日失業工人之用，企業家有浪費者，政府尤應設法取締，以免侵損勞動者之限界。</p>
<p>（五）榨取說　此即所謖資本家榨取勞動者之剩餘價值也（Exploitation　Theory）。發爲此說者，謂資本家給與勞働之工資，不過其生產物價値中扣去剩餘價値後之殘額，其着眼點蓋在資方之侵損勞方之限界。正宗之經濟學者，亦不以此等行爲爲然；研究社會政策者，尤主張節制資本，以防止此項榨取行爲。戰時各國之管制物價與工資，其目的端在求其平衡，使資方勞方各得相當之分配。惜乎此種管制方法，在統計不够完備，及行政缺乏效率之國家，不能措置裕如耳。</p>
<p>（六）獨占說　獨占之意義，近於壟斷（Monopoltheorie勞方聯合，亦可以壓制資方，以抬高其工資。此種階級獨占，必致造成階級鬥爭。因此更有所謂勢力說者（Power　Principle）。務以强力應付對方爲事，協調旣非所問，離經濟可以找求之標準尤遠，且徒事紛爭而不復顧及生產事業之發展，自非正當辦法。</p>
<p>右列諸說，除後二種，出於仇視心理，無足置議外，蓋莫不重視生產事業之負担能力，而其負祖能力之衡量，則以產物之利潤爲對象。換言之，勞働之取得工資，乃是向企業家分配生產物之生產財，並非接受企業家之救濟費。此乃勞方應有之自尊精神，亦即企業家應有之合作精神也。吾人於此，當可找求工資之標準矣。或謂勞動生活，應逐步提高，俾社會民生得以安定，此說誠値得贊許。但當此國際貿易暢通，世界物價漸臻平衡之際，生產物之價格，旣不得不受市塲之支配，則工資之負担，要不得不有最高之限度。逾此限度將使市塲被佔，產業傾覆，社會民生終不免交受其弊。今之談工資標準者，咸着眼於戰前工資，以爲此即底薪，可參照生活指數加以調整即得。不知目前產業界之情形，除極少數外，較之戰前，不知降落若干倍，故以此爲社會政策則可，如即以此爲經濟上之生產政策則不可。况就社會政策而言，此種責任亦未可使脆弱之生產事業獨力支持也。抑更有進者，凡生產事業未能負担較優之工資者，或出於經營方針之不善，或由於生產設備之不良，或由於使用勞工之不經濟，此等情形，廠商皆應覺悟，力求改進，不可於現在狀況內斤斤爲工資之爭執。至於勞動之可貴，在能增加生產物之價値，若其技術不良，效率太差，則其本能未盡，亦未可徒求生活之提高。是故資方勞方，應各自整飭，各求進步，則生產上之配合自易，，而分配上之爭議自滅。先進國家之勞務管理，其於雇傭之選鐸，派事之準則，皆不惜勞費，於事先極力審愼，及已經任職，則技術之訓練，保健之設備，優良工人之獎進，允不惜日計月會，努力改進，宜其生產指數與勞働生活兼程並進矣。返觀我國，當其　傭之時，往往過於草率，或賣人情，或貪廉價，及任職以後，又以管理欠周，失於控制，則又怨天尤人，欲求遺散而不可得。其在勞方，當其求職之時，亦往往饑不擇食，視同傳舍，而上工以後，即東評西較，日咎雇主之不優待。雙方台作，太無誠意，是故風吹草動，工潮立起。竊以爲勞資糾紛之迭起，其癥結或端在於此。如不從根本上各自盡其在我，而祇期待當局之調解，斯眞舍本而逐末矣。</p>

<h3>日巨量金銀鑄塊埋藏東京灣水底　美軍築水閘始挖掘工作</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿四日電〕日本官員曾於去年七月間，以巨量金銀鑄塊，埋在東京濺船塢旁水底，此項寳藏業經發現。美海軍今日下午以大型抽水機數架，將塢旁之水全部抽去。入，美水兵明日將在摩爾上以指揮下，開始將塢底三四呎厚之泥土予以淸除，以便挖掉其下寳藏。潛水夫於建築水閘時，業已撈獲金銀一百卅四塊，距尼爾遜上尉於一月前撈獲第一塊之處約五十呎。據尼爾遜及日本滒水夫報吿，曾發現金銀塊兩堆，每塊長寬各二十呎，堆積泥中，一如舖路石塊。但僅撈獲一塊，據稱內含白銀。領導尼爾遜至該處者爲一日本眼綫，據稱，日本官員於去年七月指揮工人，將此項金塊投擲水底，彼即爲工人中之一。後某工悉其所投者爲金銀，官員即警吿勿將秘密洩露，並云所埋寳藏，係用以「建設大日本」者。聞此項金塊價値約三百億日圓，合美金約二十億元。但據美方所獲消息，並無如此之多。投擲塢旁之金塊不下數千，分載卡車二輛，惟據潛水夫報告，金塊散佈區域甚廣，故揣測或有更多金塊投入水底，爲此眼綫所未見。</p>
<h3>從舊大陸到新大陸　大西洋途中雜寫</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特約記者　毛樹清</p>
<p>大西洋三千二百英里的海程，把西方的世界，截成了兩個極不相同的部份，經過這六年艱苦的戰爭以後，多少人在慨嘆着「沒落了的歐洲」，多少歐洲的年靑人，在憧憬單顯著海洋的另一邊，那兒有自由，有希望？還有，西方人最最重視的物質的享受。當我乘坐的威廉瑪麗勝利號軍艦，駛出法國哈佛港口時，美國退伍的士兵們在在歡，年靑的法國孩子和法國姑娘們，眺望著舊大陸的最後一塊土地，凝視，沉默，終於笑逐顏開了。</p>
<p>很多有遠見的國際觀察家，都爲法國的前途担憂。船上，一位美國軍曹亨利，他說得很坦白：「我雖然沒到過中國，但是，我知道中國的情形，和法國一樣混亂，然而，我從來沒遇見一個中國人，他不自信中國的前途，從來沒遇見一個中國人，不以身爲中國人爲榮。法國人就不是這樣。」亨利的話，第二天我就找著了證明，那便是我同船，睡在我旁邊的法國年靑人的翰·波拉。</p>
<p>約翰當過法國陸軍的伍長，但是：「法國士兵的生活，比富人的狗還不如」。因此，三年下來，約翰不但不願意再入伍，他決心離開法國：「我可以做一個任何國家的公民，爲什麽一定要依靠著法國」？他還說：『如果不能取得美國的國籍，我決心到澳洲去，澳洲政府已經向西歐各國徵求二百五十萬移民，我能說英文，當然沒問題』！</p>
<p>美國軍隊在船上發給剩餘的軍用品，約翰和其他許多平民旅客一樣，他有十多塊巧克立，兩罐美國花生米，兩條紙烟，他興奮得跳起來。晚上，他把花生米放在枕邊，直要吃到睡着爲止，早上眼睛一睜開，又開始吃花生米。他吿訴我：『道便是我爲什麽決心脫離法國的原因』。我微笑點頭。</p>
<p>法國的貧窮，現在不僅是法國本身的問題，同時，也成爲歐洲政治問題中非常嚴重的一環。去年冬天的臨時國會的選舉，共產黨得票最多。有位巴黎自由晚報的記者對我說：共產黨之所以得票最多，因爲婦女都投票給它。據說，法國共產黨對婦女的宣傳，相當成功，他們吿訴巴黎的太太小姐們：妳們不是愁沒有肉，沒有麵包，沒有絲襪，沒有衣料嗎？選舉共產黨，共產黨會解決妳們的困難！那位自由晚報的記者說：『今年六月，要選舉正式國會議員了。』他預料共產黨決不會再勝利。</p>
<p>我因爲最後一次到巴黎時間太倉促，並沒化多少功夫硏究法國未來的選舉。不過，無論從任何觀點去看，當前法國嚴重的經濟問題，都足以牽動全歐的政局。美法大借款還沒有成功，社會黨的「開山宗」萊翁勃侖，居然拚著老命跑華盛頓。借款如果成妥，古盎內閣還可以延續，社會黨在下屆競選中，仍然有左右逢源的可能，借款失收，也許法國的情形，會大變特變。但是，據內幕中人的看法，美國也需要有一個相當時期的「觀望」，觀望法國本身，今後將有怎樣一個演變？</p>
<p>因爲有這樣一個參差，新舊大陸的兩邊，流散著各種可怕的憤懣·莫斯科在上一個月，宣佈供給法國五十萬噸小麥，共產黨藉的交通部長，大吹大擂的派遣法國僅有的兩條運輸輪，出發黑海裝載。巴黎有一張小報，很幽默的寫了一段：「是不是每一顆小麥的代價，相等於一張選舉票呢」！法國人看著都笑了。</p>
<p>我問遜船上平民旅客中的許多法國人，一位銀行家拈著鬍鬚說：「共產黨決不會再獲勝，戴高樂將軍遲早總有一天，會東山再起」！另外一位年靑法國小伙子，不同意這些話。他說：「戴高樂不成，古盎是糊塗蛋，萊翁勃倫本身就是一個大資本家，他家裏滿藏著金條」。我問他可曾親眼看見？他伸了一下舌頭，沉　半響說：聽別人說的」！</p>
<p>法國眞是一個「天眞」到不可思議的民族，在法國歷史上，沒有一個全國性的聖腎或英雄，許多法國人也許景仰拿破侖，但是，拿破侖曾經被國際社會唾棄過。克萊蒙梭時代的法國，曾經雄視過世界，但是，法國人說，如果當年沒有克萊蒙埃，便沒有一九四〇年的災患。法國巴黎許多銅像，都是些文學家，詩人，音樂聖手之類。法國的郵票和鈔票上，刋印著法國的美女，「五百年必有王者興」，在法國的歷史上，就從未見過一個「王者」。</p>
<p>沒有「王者」的民主政治，造成了法國混亂的政局，從第一次大戰到第二次大戰之問，法國內閣的更迭，是任何民主的國家所罕見的。戴高樂想改換從前的內閣制到總統制，而且是相當集權的總統制，被臨時國會轟下台來，古盎內閣上台第二天，物價漲了三四倍，巴黎的黑市美金從二百法朗比一，跳躍到四百比一。古盎內閣的第一砲，便是緊縮財政，政府人員，幾乎裁去了一半，被裁的失業，不裁的閙窮。物價漲了公務員的薪水沒有漲，反映到社會，便是散漫，紊亂，行政效率，辦事效率的低落。我離開哈佛港那天，去一個外交部辦理護照出入口的衙門請求出境，那位公務員拿起圖章，毫不盤問的就是「照蓋」，蓋了岡章以後，接蒲和我聊閑天，把圖章裝入公事大皮包，問我：</p>
<p>「你初次來港口嗎？沒參觀過這兒市區嗎？」</p>
<p>我搖搖頭。</p>
<p>他說，他願意帶我作一次街遊。當我跟在他後面，走出衙門的時候，距離下辦公時間，還有一個半鐘頭，我爲後繼而來的人担憂：如果再有一個人來申請出境，將不知如何是好？</p>
<p>路上，他吿訴我，他是五口之家的家長，薪水不堪溫飽，在哈佛港，不容易找到兼差。我問他港上有沒有法國商船，他苦笑着：『什麼都沒有了，全是美國的！』</p>
<p>事實上，大西洋上美國船並不多，美國的商船更少。我坐的威廉瑪麗勝利號，是戰時趕着造的海上運輸船，羅斯福總統『兩洋造艦計劃』中的第五十一號。我問船上的負責人，將來是不是可以改爲商船？他說：美國無意在大西洋上發展海運業務。</p>
<p>大西洋的航業，還是在英國手裏，英國的瑪麗皇后號，和伊利莎伯皇后號六萬多噸，仍然是全世界商船的『泰斗』。每次從英國南漢潑頓到紐約，或從紐約到英國，都是將近萬人的旅客，運轍軍隊的人數更多。船上有球塲，戲院，游泳池·因爲船身大，在海洋中不感到煩　之苦。據說，英國航業界對麗瑪皇后翰裝運美國軍隊，非常傷心，原因是：美國兵常常用小刀割破桌子或板壁，檢一小塊帶回美國作紀念。他們認爲：一生能坐一次瑪麗皇后號，可爲終身回憶之事。這次倫敦使館人員，參加聯合國機構工作的，他們都坐瑪麗皇后號赴美·包華國先生從英國到紐的，也是坐的此船。</p>
<p>其次，挪威的海上業務，正在迎頭趕上的力圖恢復。德國投降後不久，挪威的若干商船，就重振美國與歐洲之間的航運。最近，挪威正接洽向美國借款，以借款全部向美國購買船隻及定造商船，我在巴黎，曾經遇著前任的巴黎領事，他說：不久以後，挪威將有船開到遠東來。</p>
<p>航業競爭是貿易競爭的前奏，在英國，現在到處都貼著「節衣縮食，增加生產，發展對外貿易」的標語，電影，無綫電廣播，無一不在鼓吹著「對外貿易」。大半有知識的英國人都明白，英國是依靠國際貿易起家的國家，他們寗願自己緊縮節儉，省下來銷到海外，實際上，現在英國人穿的是最粗劣的毛呢，（不下於我們的西北毛呢）享受的是量商單的工業品。英國人喫不到鷄蛋，和足够的牛油，甚至一顆蔬菜，一塊排骨，在英國都是食譜上的珍品，前些時，英國各報章，一致攻擊工黨內閣的糧食部長，匹克狄壘幾家電影院，放映出糧食部長的相片，旁邊加上各種侮蔑「挖苦」的字句。同時，還放映出幾十個家庭主婦，爲買不到油，糖，麵包，蔬菜，鷄蛋，等等的怨言。有好幾家報紙，指出英國食品的缺乏，是由於英瞬過份供給德國佔領區之故？他們責問政府：「爲什麽我們要救濟仇敵，讓自己挨餓？」於是，艾德禮首相會見了蒙哥馬利元帥。</p>
<p>說明事實的眞相。我還聽到倫敦海德公園許多「街頭演說家」，爲食料恐慌攻擊工黨政府。</p>
<p>同機是民主的國家，法國的和英國的不同，英國的人和美國的不同。當輪船經過十天單調的旅程，駛進紐約港口的時候，船上的美國官兵們，都大叫大跳起來。揷滿美國國旗的紅十字會的小火輪，駛到港外來歡迎，小火輪上站滿著美國小姐們，她們招手歡迎他們的健兒們凱旋歸來。</p>
<p>自由神像依然矗立在紐約海邊，一百多層的『摩天大樓』，一度被飛機衝壞了屋頂的，現在又金碧輝煌的重建了起來。赫特遜河口，大大小小的船舶，像密集的蜂羣一樣，最近建成的密特威航空母艦，四萬五千噸的海上堡壘，也泊在港口。</p>
<p>霓虹燈照亮着紐約的每一條街，泰姆士十字街口。成千成萬的車輛和行人，這「金元王國」，經過四年戰爭的錘練，不但沒有絲毫衰頽，而且比從前更興隆更繁華起來了。時代的輪子，輾走了舊大陸，給新大陸這年靑的國家，創造了登峯造極的境界。（三月三十一日寄自紐約）</p>

<h3>電影業招待記者報告　對號入座多困難　謂如警局不收回成命全體影戲院可能停業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市電影業同業公會，爲市警局勒令八戲院停業事，特於昨日下午三時在康樂酒家招待記者，報吿經過。由理事長梁其田任主席，常務理事匡寳瑩報吿及闡述對號困難情形；略謂事實上實行對號，需費甚大，確非一般影院所能負擔者，蓋對號入座，需加倍雇用職員，一千座位，至少需用十五人領位；每人每月薪水至少亦需十三四萬元。同時戲票印有號碼，如不能全部出售，每日浪費極多，每票成本需十元，一日數塲耗費可知。如不對號，則戲票可速續使用。此外有武裝之人入院後，任意挑選座位，如對號後，勢必引起糾紛</p>
<p>梁氏繼亦聲明困難數點稱，目前票價已一再上漲，若院方開支不敷，勢必再加價，不僅觀衆負擔增高，院方營業亦將受影響。對號後，觀衆必遲到，塲內燈熄後，陸續到達，必妨碳其他觀衆視綫，秩序未必可改善。</p>
<p>該會常務理事大華戲院經理李迪雲稱：警局命令，屢次遵守，並未藐視，如十二歲以下兒童不准入場，現已遵守。本市公共塲所中秩序，均認爲以影院爲最佳，而對於塲外黑票以及擺攤並交通等問題，則希望當局能協助先予改善。如警局不能收回成命，則全體影院可能停業，故盼各界主持公道。</p>

<h3>同情自殺　女被猛戳男不及自殉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕北京西路一一一〇弄十七號定海金姓女被情人武書盈，用力戳斃一案，已誌昨報。茲據調查所得，武係定海書香之家，曾畢業於聖約翰大學，惟無恒產，故迄今尙未與金結婚。惟武金兩人，相交有年，情愛彌篤，終覺抱恨終身，遂相的同情自殺。女囑武先用刀將其戳死後，再行自殉，不料當武舉刀猛戳，第一刀時，女痛極大呼，且語武云「速弄死，速弄死」，於是武連戳其腹·頸·喉·臂等處五刀，血花四濺，不支而踣。後經家人聞聲到來，武一時不及自殉，嗚捕趕到，將兇犯帶入靜安寺分局收押，受傷之女，亟送仁濟醫院療治罔效，未幾身死。據武書盈供認行兇不諱，待偵查完畢後，擬一二日內申解地檢署依法究辦。</p>

<h3>滬閔班車遭盜刦　單帮客飮彈喪命　五盜獲其三搜出一部份臓物</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬漕汽車公司之滬閔班車，早班規定爲晨七時半，由愛多亞路東新橋站駛出，昨晨按時起程。由司機者吳文啓駕駛三五八四八號卡車一輛，向目的地前進。八時二十分許駛至滬閔公路二號橋堍，詎車廂中忽有五盜出現，計西裝者兩名，長衫者兩人，短裝者一人，槍械有四桿。一盜出械向吳威脅，令開慢車，餘盜乃向旅客逐一搜到。行約一里半許，所有男女旅客二十餘名，莫不囊空如洗，損失金戒二枚，金手錶一只，法幣百餘萬元。五盜下車竄逸未遠，經途人據情報吿長橋派駐所，由巡官率警追捕，衆盜情急生智，先有二盜在公路上截住販戶張關根·張友良兩輛自由車，疾駛而逸。未幾，又有單帮客金妙根（本地人廿七歲）踏一石二斗白米到來，一盜亦欲搶刦其自由車未遂，致觸盜怒，竟拔槍開放一響，命中金後腦，當塲倒地身死。全車一輛卒被刦去。尙餘二盜，一逃至漕河涇，被保衛團拘獲，一竄至柿於灣，經警局股員陳世雄巡邏到來，得訊緊追，遂發生警員格鬥，互射數槍，卒由交通警陸志祥協助，奮勇衝上，將盜攔腰抱住，倒地就擒。帶入散華分局偵訊時，在其身畔抄出一部份贓物。事後漕河涇龍華梅家弄等處保衛團曾四出閣捕餘盜，直至薄暮時，尙在跴緝中。據悉死者金妙根住吳家巷四號，遺有一妻一女。</p>

<h3>粵省級公務人員大請願　廣州市大中學生休課一小時</h3>
<p>— 本報十九日航訊　特派員梁風寄自廣州</p>
<p>彷彿流行性的感冒，最近廣州的罷工與港課潮風訟一時，請願及變名詞的「請似待命」接二連三的發生，而最聳動聽聞的當推公務員大請願，相當嚴重的則是省立廣州女子師範學校及另四個省校聲援的『請假待命一了。</p>
<p>公務員有組織的團結起來，本來是很不容易的事。但在這革命策源地的廣東，就來了這個全國未有的創舉。</p>
<p>公務員在抗戰的時候，對國家不能說沒有很大的重獻，流離轉徙，待遇菲薄，嘗盡了苦頭，但總能咬緊了牙根默默忍受着。可是勝利以後，由於物價波動，莫不深感生活比前更困苦，政府雖迭次提高薪俸加成，但仍趕不上物價飛漲之速，而且此間審計處自去年十一月份起，就嚴厲執行『銓審聯繫辦法」與「公務員支薪限制辦法」，不參照當地實際情形而實施這些辦法，致一大部份公務員的薪永被尅扣，加重了他們的痛苦，因此省府所屬民。財。建·敎等十大機構的公務員都感到有一種需要，必須急起自謀，就發起籌設『廣東省級公務員福利協進會」。</p>
<p>這是純公務員的組織，在四月初旬，由各機構各推派代表一人籌備，工作進行得很快，到十日成熟，十一日招待新聞記者，報告該會組成之原則及旨趣。他們一方面籌設員工消費合作社，輔助政府平抑物價，增進一般公務員的福利；另一方面就公開對審計處攻擊，作了翌日質問審計處的先聲。</p>
<p>要求解釋理由</p>
<p>並通過十二條提案</p>
<p>十二日下午二時在中正中學大禮堂內，這個大會正式成立，參加的有一千五百多個公務員，即席通過派代表二人邀請審計處李處長悅義蒞會解釋尅扣公務員薪津之理由，又通過十二條提案：（一）組織省公務員福利協進會，設員工眷屬消費合作社，聯誼社，設置圖書館等，經費除請省府酌撥福利事業費外，由會員負責籌集。（二）設立省級公務負子弟學校，及在各公立學校設應備之名額。（三）請省府撥發公務員制服兩套。（四）請省府准每員貸金十萬元，應於五個月分期淸還。（五）請省府轉呈行政院根據公務員還都救濟金辦理，追撥該款。（六）請省府函請救濟分署發給救濟物品。（七）請省府迅速向敵產處理局交涉撥敵僞產業作員工宿舍。（八）請省府酌發米，布，平價供應，以减輕公務員負擔。（九）呈請中央對嚴格執行公務員銓釵法規，本省應延緩至明年實施。（十）請省府對公務長待遇應依照中央信託局各銀行之薪俸發給。（十一）請省府按期發薪，每月分一日，十六日兩次發給。（十二）省公務員被審計處核低薪俸，其損失應由其負責賠償。</p>
<p>職員走避一空</p>
<p>誤將記者毆打一陣</p>
<p>經過二小時討論，提案通過後，而李處長仍不見至，羣情憤恨，遂決定全體列隊到審計處質問李處長。列舉八條理由，男女公務員千餘人組成了一條長行列，手持大橫額及「質問審計處」的旗幟兩枝，浩浩蕩蕩出發；到審計處後，隊伍停立門前，派代表登至二樓請見李處長，記者們也隨同入內採訪。該處人員稱：李處長外出，由該處秘書接見，代表們因爲秘書不能代表審計處意見，乃向大隊報吿，隊伍聞訊，羣情激動，高呼口號，鼓噪不已。若干公務員在激憤之下衝進處內，處內職員已走避一空，僅留一兩什役看守。這一來，更火上添油，將室內設備搗毀不堪，領隊人負無法遏止。更有趣的是一通訊社記者，被誤以爲是該處職員，毆打了一頓，後明白眞象，代表們才向他道歉了事。同時鄰近該處的財廳駐守衛兵，誤以爲發生意外，竟在鐵閘內架起機關槍，對向羣衆，以防萬一。後大隊因不得要領，又整隊往行營，省府分向張主任羅主席請願，由行營甘參謀長接見主席團，表示公務員今日之困難予以同情，並允將困難轉呈中央。代表又將請願經過轉吿立在門口的全體公務員，公務員半日的奔勞呼籲，總算得到圓滿的答覆而散會了。</p>
<p>處長書面變話</p>
<p>認此舉爲一椿遺憾</p>
<p>可是審計處於事後除請求憲兵派隊保護外，又通知地方法院檢察處派員到該處偵察事件經過，又邀請兩廣監察使劉侯武前赴該處巡察，追究責任應該誰負？李處長又發表書面談話，謂公務員手携機槍及長短槍械結隊，不由分說，衝入處內，將室內設備搗毀無餘，現本處無法執行職務，並認爲此事發生於抗戰勝利，建立法治之際，殊覺遺憾。之後，又於十三日停止辦公，並在各報登出緊急啓事，發表書面談話，大談審計法規，對公務員愛莫能助，一面呈報中央依法辦理。</p>
<p>公務員提申辯</p>
<p>謂此純係正當行動</p>
<p>公務員福利會見到李處長畫面談話後，也發表書面申辯，反駁李處長談話，謂此次純爲正當行動，公務員並非暴徒，全無携帶機槍及長短槍械者，只有審計處門口守衛兵士持槍。至於審計處樓下門窗檯椅之毀壞，實因當時</p>
<p>財廳警衛隊架設機槍，正對公務員，使公務員突起驚慌，分散各街，一部份倉皇避入審計處，本會代表雖力呼鎭靜，但已無法遏止云云。另又連日分謁行營張主任，劉監察使及省府羅主席，審計部林部長雲陔（已於十八日返渝）將該會成立經過與目的，及質問李處畏事件，有所報吿及解釋，均獲得長官們之同情與關懷，對於審計處扣削公務薪俸，表示覓求妥善解決辦法。</p>
<p>秀才一塲「造反」</p>
<p>靜候中央合理解決</p>
<p>至於此事發生後，當局爲使這糾紛不致擴大，由劉監察使斡旋，與行營派員進行調處，羅主席並表示意見：（一）査明事實眞象，秉公辦理。（二）賠償損失。（三）絕對保陣審計人員安全。又表示對公務員薪津問題，省府當謀合理解決。</p>
<p>因此，雙方都遵照上峯的命令，聽候調解，審計處亦於十五日恢復辦公。</p>
<p>自十二日揭開這一幕全武行的演出，繼之針鋒相對的打着筆墨官司，報紙變成了戰塲，異常熱閙，現在一切都成了尾聲。公務員方面表示：薪津若短期內未能改善，則再請願，使達到合理解決，福利事繼續籌備。審計處方面則稱：糾紛靜候中央解決，結果給老百姓看了一塌好戲，都說：秀才也『造反」了哩！</p>
<p>因爲公務員的請願是較爲新奇的，使大家的目光均集中在那裏，連「請假待命」愈鬧愈兇的風潮都疏忽了。等公務員大請願的高潮退了後，大家的目光又移到了這裏。</p>
<p>中大掀起風潮</p>
<p>各校仿行請假待命</p>
<p>罷課變相的「請假待命」，是中山大學掀起的，他們因爲近三月來廣州的米價昂貴，區區貸金，實無法維持，就實行請假待命，以求獲得改善，以致羣起仿效</p>
<p>廣州的米價自本月起，更漲到四萬六千元一担，而省立師範及省立職校的公費學生每月每生祗得四千元，每月伙食不能維持，雖以前曾由各校校長請求敎廳轉請敎部增發，敎廳答允轉呈敎部追加至八千元，惟公文往返，輾轉費時，自不能即有款到，各生亦靜候敎育部批覆。但至十一日，敎育廳長姚寳猷到省立女子師範訓話。該校全體學生六百餘人聯呈姚廳長，請求增發公費每月每生一萬五千元，吾則即行「請假待命」。姚廳長以此事須俟敎育部批覆，但亦祗能增至八千元，乃婉勸各生靜候。各生以姚廳長答覆未能滿意，即刻全校停課，並開全體大會，成立女師師範生生活改善請求委員會，決議向敎廳請求：（一）改善生活，（二）准予延期服務，（三）加强學校衛生設備，（四）保障就業，（五）改善課程。姚廳長曾一一答覆，並表同情，允設法帮忙，並出佈吿，謂此事當非一二日間可以簽復，而且已得敎部批准增至八千元，該款已一部匯到，俟審計處核定後，即可發給，先行補發二三月份各八千元。勸令學生以學業爲重，先行復課。學生方面則堅持：事情不得解決，則仍請假待命，並於十二日發出吿社會人士書，呼籲聲援及派員向各有關機翻單位聯絡，及準備聯合全市公費生，一致請求改善待遇，以維學業。</p>
<p>舉行聯合請願</p>
<p>開會決定請願條件</p>
<p>也許他們生活的苦况是實在的情形，一聲呼號即得到熱烈的響應，本市文代界也表示同情，各師範學校更因同病相憐，表示誓爲後盾。首先省立勷勤師範予以援助，跟着省立文理，法商兩學院及廣州職業學校，亦因深受同樣痛苦，文理即實行「請假待命」聲援女師，並組成五校聯合會，向當局聯合請願。</p>
<p>十六日晨全市中上學校學生，也爲聲援女師而休課一小時。</p>
<p>十七日五校聯合會開會決定；派代表向羅主席請願，請願內容爲：（一）改善生活，請發公費實數比照公糧二斗三升，加上省級公務員生活補助費基數四分之一，並按月於五日前發給。（二）發給復員費。（三）改善敎職員待遇。（四）保障師範生職業生就業。（五）增發實習費。（六）增加衛生設備，如不獲完滿答覆則繼續請假。同日下午又舉行文化新聞界招待會，會中各校代表先後發出了沉痛的呼聲，這呼聲說明他們目前生活的苦况與無限的辛酸，現有兩間被迫在「請假待命」了！他們主要的問題還是在生活太苦與出路無保障幾方面，他們紛紛的說出，有些貸金總是積久，有些在戰時每人可領到二斗三升公糧，現在公糧俘止了，每月僅得一千五百元代金，雖說一月份起已增至四千元，但目前仍領到一千五百元，吃稀飯都不够，學校的生活，宿舍不够分配，有些連床都沒有，電燈不亮，自來水不靈，衛生設備太差……一連串的苦辛，怎使人不掬同情之淚？</p>
<p>廳長發表懇談</p>
<p>學生應以學業爲重</p>
<p>此間敎育當局亦不憚煩地向師範生勸勉復課，姚廳長並發表談話，對他們各項要求，逐一答覆當謀合理解決，並十分誠懇地開導學生，自愛愛國，應以學業爲重。</p>
<p>因此，「請假待命」堅持了七日的廣州女師師範生，已於昨十八日先行復課，再繼續請求，直到獲得完滿的結果始罷。</p>
<p>敎授到長同學書</p>
<p>詞意懇切一字一淚</p>
<p>女師復課了但是文理學院仍在「請假」中，除請改善生活外，並要求改辦大學，學校負責人雖苦口婆心的勸導，亦無結果。昨（十八）日該院全體教授五十七人署名致同學書，勸吿學生循正途復課，首謂：「要求改善待遇，提高公費貸金數額，原甚合理，惟解決問題須循正軌，仝人等責重酬微，飢寒交迫，早爲社會人士爲共知，但仍敎學不輟，不「請假待命」，藉罷課以圖改善者，乃認學術文化爲社會進步之要素，敎育爲國家民族之命脈，不可片刻中斷，更不忍令誼同家人之摯愛同學，陷于無課可上，無法研讀，虛擲光陰之苦境。今要求提高貸金，進行「改大」等，遽以罷課之方法出之，曾不慮及犧牲之如何，影響之如何，同人深爲惋惜。最後又勉勵學生要以學業爲重，光陰可貴。」詞意懇切，一字一淚。</p>
<p>截至現在止，文理院的學生仍在「請假待命」中，且該院院長辦公室及訓導主任室門口，同時發現「手榴彈」兩枚，用紙包上大書「危險」兩字，在學生耐爲什麼會有這樣的武器，自屬巾人尋味的事。這事發生後該院敎授及社會人士聞訊，都深表憤慨。至此事如何發展下去，該院學生是否再堅持罷課，現尙不知。但綜觀最近十日來，一連串所發生的事情，都是象徵社會問題的嚴重，及敎育前途潛伏的危機。當然，誰都明白政府的困難，實不能過份苛求；，但至少能迅速設法救濟，和合理的解決，才可排除不斷發生的事情。（四月十九日，於廣州。）</p>

<h3>警局偵查漸有效力　証券黑市零落　公債盤旋六千關口　華洋股票均見疲跌</h3>
<p>昨證劵大杰有便衣警務人查勘，投機者望風喪足，實旮債市幾吿停頓，勢轉平後，始有交易，惟屬三三兩兩，以各種方式演出，有等於無，大致統內初時在六二五零元供方壓迫下，逐步打破六千元大關，見五九〇〇元低價，最後在六千元大關盤旋，午收結果計甲乙丁戊小疲，丙種回跌三百元，純受客觀環境不利，賣買進行不一暢，遭受打擊，有以致之，華股大部份停業，聞中央路某號有學徒兩人，手持股票，被警局巡査人員逮捕，以孜其他各處更爲震驚，各對敲大戶，四處設法力謀補救，在無妥適辦法前，暫抱觀望，各股交易係游擊性質之讓受，四處凑集，無連貫性之暗中　價而已，各股因持有者了結之故，一度怯疲’最後喊價略有回振，較之前收計各熱冷股票均見疲落，號稱股市三小熱之景　新光勤興，昨同時舉行股東會，議決資本由僞中儲券改爲國幣，並發息一分，外股情形更爲嚴秘，公開性之成交絕無僅有，除怡紗等最熱門在前收價有所供給外，餘均寂然，近午始有逢低吸收者，各股遂稍稍喊價，結果較前日均吿微降。</p>
<h3>金鈔均徵跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨初開尙堅，一般心理對一六中行配給價，仍多顧忌，不無打擊，買氣至此又復萎縮，以致不脫盤旋，晨開一五九萬，惟一六〇萬之價難予穿出，不久美鈔回頭，金市遂多脫手之流，曾退居一五七萬元光景盤旋，迨後一度回升少許，起仆範圍狹窄，迄午刻仍在一五七萬五左右，午後略形平穩，結果較前收微挫一萬，飾金十六萬八，紋銀一千六，銀元一〇五〇元有賣，暗拆稍形平定，息價自一角二分至一角半。</p>
<p>美鈔轉呈掙扎，求供已吿平衡，晨開在二三五〇元左右，美商洋行略有供給，買氣遂怠，曾回挫至二二七〇元，此後在二三〇〇元內外屢進屢退，午後趨勢轉形穩定、稍見喊高，結果較前收回跌三十元，港票初時尙穩，羅比轉鬆，而後稍疲，結果較前收回跌五元，美滙仍平，港電四一五元，羅比五一〇元均有成交。</p>
<h3>米價繼漲　麵粉油豆跟進</h3>
<p>昨日米市以各產地堅昂，　之上升千元，麵粉在市塲上雖然無交易，但潮州廣帮塲外進胃仍濃，續加千元，汕市消化較殷，再升二三千元，豆餅亦以汕頭進取，價回漲二三百元，路貨加四五百元，麩皮亦以南洋夏門汕頭均有去路，續升四五百元，黃豆甬帮汕頭揀高略進，價漲千元，中下平平，生仕價漲一二千元，形勢提高殺次，據米市塲息，昨日本市到白粳等七種，共七千餘石，種類及石數如下，白粳三二五八石，杜秈三一五石，白元一〇〇石，早一五四石，早稻二一八五石，薄　一七三三石，蕪秈一三七石，</p>
<h3>大批食油將到　實行平價配售</h3>

<h3>已到之奢侈品　准予申請登記</h3>
<p>三月底前運抵滬待卸之舶來奢侈品一批，經海關禁提後，是批貨主即向輸入品管理處請求通融，經該處准許申請登記後連日前往申請者甚多，因該處已定本月底截止接受是項請求，再行分別貨品種類請示後，始可決定何種物資，暫予通融進口。</p>
<h3>中國經濟問題　爆裂荒最為重要</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿四日電〕據美商務部國外貿易處訊，中國　前最急迫之經濟問題，首推糧荒，糧食缺乏情形日益嚴重，有數地區且遭受饑災之威脅，燃料不足僅次於糧食問題，本年因氣候乾燥異常，業已增加蝗災之可能性，故預料今年內之米榖收穫，不足令糧食不足情形大見緩和，不僅此也，中國西南霍亂及腦膜炎頗爲猖獗，威脅該區全部居民，據中國糧食部報吿，湖南省所受打擊最重，其他災情嚴重省區，計有廣東，廣西，山東，河北平津區域等，他處之情形或同等緊急，唯由於交通及運輸工具缺乏之故，無法作週密之考察，根據滿洲東北省份傳來消息，去年此一重要農業區之收穫，尙差强人意，一時當不致發生普遍之糧荒，唯因分配之困難，或將令若干廣大消費區供不應求，據漢口美國總領事之報吿，漢口之糧食情形，足可反映湖南與湖北二省之危急狀况，湖南輸往該地之米已吿繼絕，一月間雖有自陝西及四川獲取接濟之議，唯遲遲米見實行。</p>
<h3>棉賤紗貴　紗廠獲利優厚　雙馬曾哄至一百廿二萬</h3>
<p>本埠紡織業近日突飛猛晋，原因爲（一）棉賤紗貴，廠商獲利豐厚，（二）美棉大批進口，細紗原料供量充足，（三）接收日紗廠，盡量紡織，（四）向愼昌洋行訂購美紗錠之定單頗多，實際上仍歸根於製紗獲利之優原，雖最近紡織工人工資劇增，每人每日最少三千五百元，最多六千元，紡紗一包須工費計三十五萬元，外加原棉四担餘，約三十五萬元，兩共七十萬元，但市上二十支棉紗每包售似大都在一百萬元外，故目前每包仍可盈利三四十萬元。</p>
<p>昨日紗市免起鶻落，晨初二十支雙馬進展過速，一哄而至一百二十二萬，旋以同行多頭獲利，競相求售，乃步降至一百十六萬，收市與昨價並無軒輊，然中小型什牌被帶起後，不易回落，較昨漲二萬至四萬之譜，粤帮對三十二支籃鳳細紗搜求頗夥，二十支似無大納胃，故火型紗價所漲有限。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊報漲十六至二十五磅音，計近期美金二七·八一，遠期二八·〇七，米特林現貨二八·二六，本埠現棉交易尙佳，市價愈堅，米特林送廠高至八萬二千元，成交約千包之請</p>
<h3>綢貨求過於供　絲市交易清淡</h3>
<p>昨日絲市平　，人造絲終日祇二三萬元上落，一二〇號天橋開盤一百五十三萬元，迄收盤做一百五十一萬元，較隔日小一萬元，廠經市况寂靜，交易清淡，喊價大致未更，綢貨昨又上漲，實因綢廠停工已久，存貨日短，大有求過於供之現象，美亞被面每百條又大十萬元，大誠格子璧縐每碼價喊過四千出關，終做三千九百二十元。</p>
<h3>茶價仍無起色　洋莊備活動</h3>
<p>茶市疲風未已，本街店莊進意仍懈，天津帮亦胃納久閉，目前祗對於苞種茶尙有有零星拖吸，價格方面各比前市軋低，交易更無起色，至於洋莊茶市，賡續岑靜無聲，惟聞英商行號之洋經理若千家，已相繼啓程來滬，而白頭行（即印度莊）對於華茶貿易，亦擬捲土重來云。</p>
<h3>柏油萎靡不振</h3>
<p>柏油近來因銷塲清淡，市面逐漸疲弱，雖無大跌趨勢，然萎靡不振，一時不易轉機，而各產地大都去路閉塞，咸存廉望，申市售盤近又稍削，計禾本五萬五千元，內坪四萬五千元，的于四萬元，蘭獨三萬八千元，蘭油三萬五千允，麻城二萬元。</p>
<h3>煤市交易遜色</h3>
<p>煤市趨勢依然不佳，人心閑散，進戶續呈觀望，交易仍無起色，尤以烟煤各貨最爲乏人問津，僅白煤小子略有零銷去化，市氣始終疲軟，行情於抵檔擯持而鮮變動。又本市手搖機煤球廠同業，向經濟部上海區燃料管理委員會申請配給鴻基煤層，已獲核准，即日辦理繳款。</p>
<h3>糖價步步高</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢依然堅挺，尤以中砂自爲甚，上午公會劃盤初平後緊，爲五萬六千五百元至五萬七千二百五十元，及下午又値標售之期，計中砂白二千包，五萬六千元，升五千元，三半車白五百包，六萬四千元，升三千元，生砂一千五百包，五萬二千元，升四千元，如數開通，號盤開出中砂白五萬七千五百元，至五萬八千元，綁白間有參差，開六萬一千元，靑糖叫價略高，但四萬七八千元之貨，亦有開出。</p>
<h3>英國增產　人造纖維</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦廿五日電〕每日郵報一記者就英國製造人造纖維之發展宣稱，目前英國中部不少廠家正獲得大量人造繳維原料，將供襪業應用，至於人造織維織物與奈侖絲襪之大量生產，則尙有待，一且南威爾斯之奈侖紡織廠元成，奈侖出品即將大增，小廠家亦正設法置辦更多奈侖原料。</p>
<h3>緬甸促進米產　政府　決定給予津貼</h3>
<p>〔路透社仰光廿五日電〕緬甸政府爲刺激食米生產以及協助救濟世界各地之災荒起見，頃已決定對休耕地每百畝付出津貼九十鎊，或一千二百盧比，使其恢復耕種。</p>
<h3>倫敦中國債券　市況遂漸進展</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十五日電〕「標準晚報」載，倫敦市塲上價値一千六百萬鎊之中國證券，其本身業務係於一九三八至一九三九年陷於停頓，目下情形已逐漸改善，尤以由關稅及鹽稅担保者爲最，該報指出，戰前中國四十餘個港口中，現已有十四個港口恢復開放，僅有二處繼續關閉，其餘則爲內河港口，目前此等港口之貿易範圍甚小，但此間相信中國不久將恢復其對債務之義務。</p>
<h3>美國市場上　中國皮貨的評價　一般均感覺太貴</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿五日電〕中國皮貨現已出現於全美各大商店之毛貨部，各方之批評不一，有人以爲品質極好，有人以爲皮質過硬或色澤不佳，其前途如何，尙難　言，一般均以爲價格過高，恐難暢銷，費城某商店內中國貂皮大衣標價一千四百九十五美金，此等皮大衣批發價的在九百美金左右，故零售價在一千〇九十五美金至一千二二百美金之間，買戶勢必不多，但今秋嵌皮大衣大致仍將盛行，受歡迎之毛貨當爲波斯羊，松鼠，豹，山貓，海獺，麝鼠，浣熊，林　，銀狐，藍狐與貂皮。</p>

<h3>不可避免的白人</h3>
<p>— Jack　London原著　魯莽譯</p>
<p>「可是薩克思多夫呢。一夜</p>
<p>我正打算睡覺，有兩隻「貓」開始在庭院裏唱歌。那時我還沒有上床，而站在窗邊，手裏揑着水瓶。可是正在那時我聽得了鄰室的窗打了開來。開了兩槍，那窗子又關上了。我忘記吿訴你們那行動的迅速。至多只有十秒鐘。開了窗，砰，砰兩槍，就關了窗。不管他們是誰，他一些也不停下來看看他開槍的結果。他知道。你們懂得我的意思？——他「知這。」不再有「貓」的合唱，而第二天早晨兩個冒犯者躺在那里，死透了。我覺得不可思議。到現在還覺得不可思議。第一，時候是在星光裏，而薩克思多夫並沒有對準了才開槍；其次，他打得這樣快，使得兩聲槍聲像一聲雙槍聲；最後，他看都不看就知道他已打中了他的目標。</p>
<p>『兩大以後他到船上來看我。在那時，我是公爵夫人號上的大副，那赴一艘極大的一百五十噸的縱帆船，一艘裝運黑奴的船。讓我吿訴你們，在那個時代裝運黑奴的船就是裝運黑奴的船。在船上沒有任何政府的官員，而對於「我們』也沒有政府的保護。這是粗野的工作，授與受各得其所，要是我們是完結了的話，也沒有什麼說的，而我們從每一個不驅逐得我們不能上岸的南海島把黑人裝運。不錯，薩克思多夫也上了船他說他叫約翰薩克思多夫。他是一個沙色的小個子，頭髮是沙色，皮膚是沙色，眼睛也是沙色。他沒有什麽顯着的地方。他的靈魂是像他外觀的顏色一樣中庸的。他說他是財源斷絕了，而想在船上做事情。肯做房艙的小厮，廚子，貨物管理員，或者普通的水手。對於什麼事情都什麼不知道，却說他願意學習。我並不需要他，可是他的開槍使我有這樣深的印象，以致我當做普通的水手取用了他，工錢每備月三鎊。</p>
<p>『他實在是願意學習，我可以那樣說。可是他本質地不能學習到任何什麼。他不能順次暗誦羅盤的三十二方位，正如我在這里不能像羅伯次那樣調合酒一樣。至於駕駛，他使我的頭髮都急白了。在我們馳在大海上面的時候，我從不敢冒險把舵輪交給他，而對於帆要怎樣處理他更是莫名其妙了。從來說不出在一條帆頂索與一條帆脚索之間的區別，就是說不出。頭帆和尾帆在他看來是同一件東西。要他放鬆一些主帆，而在你得知的以前，他已卸落了後帆。他跌到了海裏去過三次，他又不會游水。可是他永遠是愉快的，從不暈船，而他是我所看見過的最願意做事情的人。他是一個無法傳達的靈魂。從不講到他自己。他的歷史，只照我們所知道的講，是開始在他在公爵夫人號上簽字的那一天。他從什麽地方學會開槍，只有天上的星才知道。他是美國的北方人——那是我們從他的口音中聽出來。而那就是我們所知道他的一切了。</p>
<p>而現在我們要開始講到那要點。我們在新赫布里底的運氣並不好，五個星期只趕到十四偶工役，我們便即向所羅門羣島開去。馬拉伊達，那時像現在一樣，是一個上貨的好地方，我們便開進了馬琉，在西北角。那里有兩個泊船廊，一個在靠海岸，一個在外面些，還有一個很不安定的拋錨所；可是我們停泊得很好，接着放了火藥砲，是一種關照黑人前來而被裝運的信號。過了三天，我們一個工役都沒有得到。黑人幾百個地搖了他們的獨木舟到我們的邊頭來，可是在我們給他們看珠子和印花布小斧頭，而同他們講到在薩摩亞的種植地上工作怎樣快活的時候，他們只是笑笑。</p>
<p>『在第四天上有了一個改變。有齊巧五十個工役來簽了契的，而被關到了甲板下的大艙裏去——要到甲板上來走走是可以的，自然。自然，仔細想想，象這樣地整批簽署契的是可懷疑的，可是在那時我們以爲有什麽強有力的酋長已解除了裝運黑人的禁止。第五天的早晨，我們的兩隻划子如常地搖去了岸邊—一隻掩護又一隻，你知道，以防萬一的擾亂。也如常地，船上的五十個黑人是在甲板上，在閑走，在講話，在抽烟，在睡覺。薩克思多夫和我自己，還有四個別的水手，是留在船上的整個人數。那兩隻划子是由吉爾柏特愛蘭得爾斯防守。在一隻的裏面是船長，貨物管理員，和工役招募員。在還有一隻的裏面，是二副，那是掩護的划子，它停在離岸一百碼的所在。兩隻划子都是武裝的，雖然不大像會有擾亂發生。〔未完〕</p>
<h3>老人</h3>
<p>— 楊廉沅</p>
<p>他在這座洋樓門口的小木屋里，住下來有十七年了。</p>
<p>十七年，好一段悠長的時期啊！</p>
<p>十七年前，中國人民的革命，正在那時候，向前方邁進了一個階段，有的人覺醒了：自己還是奴隸？南方，北方，都捲起了狂飚。</p>
<p>十七年前，這位老人從風砂蔽日的皇城遷徙到這都會來。是遷徙嗎？那只有他自己知道，他是一個替人家管門的老人。那末，是應該用「求食」兩個字來代替「遷徙」，不是更適切了嗎？</p>
<p>『那時候，我剛來到這兒，那些洋人眞神氣呢！後來我也漸漸習慣了，我把服侍王公大人的方法，使出一點兒來對付他們，也就够了……』老人咳嗆了起來，話也暫時停止……</p>
<p>他又繼續講了：「做下人的，生來就是做下人的命！先生，我來到這兒十七年了，可是我壓根兒還不曾到大馬路去逛過一次，先生，聽說這個城比北京還繁華哩！可是我只看見這座洋房住着的德國人又換了法國人，前兩年，法國人走出了，又換來了東洋人。我只看到這些，我替他們看門，他們都給了我工錢，如今，我仍是看門，替你們，先生們看門啊！」</p>
<p>咳嗽聲又接着響了起來。</p>
<p>這座洋樓也古老了哩，老人的小木屋郤更破舊啦！</p>
<p>近午夜的時分，他開了大門讓最後一輛載着興盡了的主子們底轎車開進大門。於是他咳嗆着隠進小木屋。</p>
<p>過了五個小時，遠遠傳來的火車汽笛聲喚醒了他，老人起來了，緩緩地打開大門，緩教地打掃着園子四週的甬道，十七年啦，老人就這樣過了十七年，雖然這中間換過了幾回的主子？</p>
<p>以後的日子麽？這看門的老人自己也不知道。他活着或是死去，於繁華的都市沒有關係。</p>

<p>庚午歲，友人黃任之以書介紹蔡君北崙來訪曰，蔡君志節之士，籍隸台灣，而不忘祖國，捨夷狄之富貴，歸而窮餓海濱，此其人求諸晚近，殆不數數觀也。北崙瑰奇磊落，談笑風生，遂與爲逆交。君本籍福建泉州，自遜淸咸豐間太父宦遊台灣，乃家焉，甲午之役，合灣割議於日本，北崙年十二三，感憤鬱悒，懷內徙志，以親在未敢專也，不得已留學扶桑，養志待時。及父歿，又以母老，因循不得行，旋奉母命，歷仕於台灣總督署東京外務省，入以北崙且貴顯矣；而北崙則泫然自傷也！出任四年有奇，老母棄養，易簣時諭之曰：兒屈身爲終養計，今而後可以行汝志矣，北崙泣識之。旣終喪，即掛冠舉家歸祖國，名其三子曰漢基，漢威，漢光，示不忘漢也。初居西湖，後遷滬上，不恒厥居爲敎授爲律師，但求餬口不擇所業，某年海上有崑雲使者，擅相人術，談言微中，轟傳一時，名公鉅卿，多暱就之，實即北崙，效法君平託相法以自給，用心可謂苦矣，丁丑日寇侵犯我國，東南各省淪陷。敵將帥諗知北崙，屢遣使迎聘，北崙避之若浼，餌以重職，亦絕不爲動，有時不得避，則婉詞却之，却之而聘又至，復堅拒之，友人或爲之危，北崙不顧曰，苟以義死，亦復何憾，及敵寇投降，則驚喜若在，曰不圖今日復見漢族重興，吾將南旋謁吿先人之墓矣！余與北崙善知之深，於其歸也，書此以贈之。</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛（三十）</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>麗雲這時已經不哭了。因爲她從此可以天天和麗華在一起了。於是，她高興地連忙去找麗華，麗華這時正在書房裏侍候黑老爺。麗雲把一切低聲吿訴了麗華，麗華快活得跳起來了。</p>
<p>墨老爺看着兩個孩子的神氣，禁不住問他們是什麽事。天眞的麗華便又把一切興奮地吿訴了墨老爺。她原以爲墨老爺聽了這消息，也會像她們似的快活，却不料墨老爺深深嘆了一口氣說：</p>
<p>『夢，夢，又是一個「夢』啊！」</p>
<p>孩子們不了解墨老爺的意思，可也看得出來，墨老爺不但不快活，而且很難過。這祗有墨老爺自己心裏明白，他的病是爲這件事情而來。如今，他又爲這件事情感慨萬端！他理不淸紊亂的思緒，他彷彿又回到七年前的那個夢裏，他像已經沉溺在汚泥中了！</p>
<p>麗華和麗雲相互看了看，瞠目不知所云，也不敢再說下去了，於是大家陷入靜默。</p>
<p>『雲妹！雲妹妹！』實鈴大聲的喊叫。接着，漩風似的跑進了書房。</p>
<p>『寳哥哥，你這樣快就回來了！我的舖蓋都拿來了嗎？』</p>
<p>「雲妹妹，翁伯伯死了！』寳鈴上氣不接下氣地說。</p>
<p>『什麽？「墨老爺猝然震驚地坐了起來。</p>
<p>麗華麗雲都嚇得瞪大了眼。</p>
<p>「翁伯伯用燒烟的銅針。自已扎穿了肚臍。還把所有剩下的鴉片都暍下去了。我去的時候，他已經沒有氣了。床上流了許多血，我嚇得一會兒也不敢停留，就迎忙跑回來。所以你的舖蓋也沒有拿。」寳鈴緊張地說着，一面不住地拭着滿臉的汗。</p>
<p>麗雲聽罷愕然楞起來。</p>
<p>麗華嚇得直發抖。</p>
<p>忽然墨老爺自語似的嚷着。</p>
<p>『好！這一下，夢也完了！完了！」說罷，墨老爺失聲大笑。『哈哈……』</p>
<p>一陣無邊的黑暗罩下來！他不自知地嗆出了一口濃痰，然後，彷彿每次喝多了酒那樣，恍惑地；昏沌地，漩暈地，墜落下去</p>
<p>寳鈴這才驚覺地發現自己的話，闖出了禍。他來不及後悔，便急急地撲過去扶起了墨老爺。</p>
<p>『爸爸！爸爸！你怎样啦？怎樣啦』</p>
<p>『爸爸！爸爸！麗華也惶恐地叫着，搖幌着墨老爺。</p>
<p>『雲妹妹！忱拿水來！』</p>
<p>麗雲也被另一椿新的驚懼牽住了，她已經忘記了自己的事。連忙倒了一杯茶遞給寳鈴。</p>
<p>『爸爸！喝口水！爸爸　』寳鈴端着茶往墨老爺嘴裏送。</p>
<p>可是，墨老爺不再開口了！祗吃力地睜了睜疲倦的眼睛，輕輕地喊了一聲：</p>
<p>『小華　』</p>
<p>『爸爸！』麗華應着，撲到墨第爺懷裏！</p>
<p>這時墨老爺徵徵蠕動了一下，再平靜地躺到床上，就這樣，如醉如夢般停止了思想；停止了血液的流動；停止了整個生命的呼吸；而從此眞正緘默地安息了</p>
<p>『爸爸！』寳鈴的聲音變了！</p>
<p>『爸爸！』麗華哭了了！</p>

<h3>Soon Departing for the Capital, Bidding Farewell to Sichuan Compatriots: Chairman Chiang Arrives in Chengdu from Chongqing, Central Government Ministers Continue to Arrive in the Capital</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chengdu, 25th] Chairman Chiang, aboard the Mei-Ling airplane, arrived safely at Chengdu's Taiping Temple Airport at 4:30 PM on the 25th. Sichuan Provincial Government Chairman Zhang Qun arrived with him. Yu Jishi, Director of the National Government Military Affairs Bureau, and over twenty others accompanied him. Xikang Provincial Government Chairman Liu Wenhui, Sichuan-Xikang Pacification Director Deng Xihou, Sichuan Provincial Party Headquarters Director Huang Jilu, Military Academy Education Director Guan Linzheng, and others were all at the airport to greet him. It is reported that Chairman Chiang's visit is because Sichuan was the base for resistance against Japan, and Sichuan compatriots contributed more in terms of wealth and manpower during the war than any other place in the country. Now that the war has been won and the government is about to return to the capital, he has come to Chengdu specifically to bid farewell to the Sichuan compatriots, thereby expressing his intention to comfort and encourage them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] Central Organization Department Deputy Minister Yu Jingtan, Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Chairman Chen Shuren, and Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang arrived in the capital today from Chongqing aboard a special plane for the return to the capital. Central Party Headquarters Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng has rescheduled his flight to the capital for tomorrow. Organization Department Minister Chen Lifu is scheduled to arrive in the capital on the 27th, and Examination Yuan President Dai Jitao is scheduled to return to the capital on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Hankou, 24th] Xue Dubi, Duan Xipeng, and Ye Xiufeng flew from Chongqing to the capital the day before yesterday via Hankou. Due to an airplane malfunction, they were stranded here for one day. They flew to the capital together this morning at 10:00 AM. Vice Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Yan Shenyu and others were also among those traveling with them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] Today, the returning-to-the-capital plane continued to carry eleven personnel from the Soviet Embassy and ten from the French Embassy. It is reported that Soviet Ambassador Petrov will delay his arrival in the capital because his residence in the capital has not yet been arranged. However, the ambassador to China, Delfour, is scheduled to arrive in the capital from Tianjin at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 25th] The joint office of the central party, government, and military organs remaining in Chongqing was established today at the Military Affairs Commission. The director of the office is Zhu Shaoliang, and the deputy directors are Xu Xiaoyan and Chen Kewen. From now on, personnel from the party, government, and military organs remaining in Chongqing will be under the unified command of this office. As soon as the central organs have completed their return to the capital, this office will be dissolved.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun and Minister of Food Xu Kan arrived in Shanghai by plane from the capital at 4:00 PM yesterday. This reporter met with Mr. Yu at the airport and immediately inquired about the progress of the Sino-American loan and the amount of the loan. Mr. Yu said with a smile that it was not yet time to disclose that. It is reported that Mr. Yu will stay in Shanghai for a short period of time to handle financial and fiscal affairs in this city. Those who arrived in Shanghai on the same plane as Mr. Yu and others yesterday included Qian Xinzhi, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Communications, and Yu Shuming, General Manager of the Farmers Bank of China.</p>
<h3>Marshall to Fly to the Capital Soon; Future KMT-CCP Talks to be Held in the Capital</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] Chongqing News: Marshall may fly to the capital on the 27th. The plane has already arrived in Chongqing to await him. Furthermore, this afternoon the Chongqing radio station inquired about the weather in Nanjing, leading to widespread rumors in the capital that Marshal Marshall would arrive in the capital at 4:00 PM this afternoon. It was later learned that this was not accurate, but according to General McClure, Marshall is indeed planning to fly to the capital on the 27th.</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Chongqing, 25th] The government has notified the Chinese Communist Party that future meetings must be held in Nanjing. At the same time, Special Envoy Marshall continues to meet with leaders of various parties. This morning, he held talks with key figures from the Democratic League. However, the military three-person team will not meet in the coming days. Marshall and the other two members may travel to the capital at the end of this week and then hold a meeting. There is no news of progress in the talks from Marshall's side. He has asked someone to relay that he has no news to report to the press. A CCP spokesman said that he believes that even if an agreement is reached on resolving the Northeast problem, the communist forces that have already occupied Changchun and surrounded Harbin would "be unwilling to hand over the two cities to the central government." The CCP is still demanding a ceasefire in the Northeast as the price for negotiating political disputes related to government reorganization and troop reductions. If a ceasefire order is issued and the two armies maintain the status quo, then the CCP will have occupied one hundred districts in the Northeast, while the Nationalist army will only occupy twenty districts. The Nationalist Party wants to obtain the two cities of Harbin and Changchun, and the only way to do that is to send troops to seize them.</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] It is widely rumored here that when Special Envoy Marshall holds another meeting with the KMT and CCP representatives, the National Government will especially seek to control certain areas of the Northeast militarily, but it must withdraw from Changchun and must not advance into Harbin and Longjiang (Qiqihar).</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Washington, 24th] President Truman's special envoy to China, Marshall, has the primary task of stopping the fighting in the Northeast. His second task will be to advise both the KMT and the CCP to jointly abide by the resolutions passed by the Political Consultative Conference. According to news from Chongqing, the central government has agreed to postpone the National Assembly scheduled to be held in Nanjing on May 5, which is a major concession to the CCP. The situation has eased considerably, and it is reported that the central government is also prepared to compromise on the Northeast issue. If the CCP refuses to participate in the National Assembly, Marshall's plan will suffer a serious setback. The fact that Marshall is returning to his post with his wife this time shows that he intends to reside in China for a long time, and his determination to unite China and consolidate the foundation of peace can also be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Repairing the Yellow River Bridge</h3>
<p>The Pinghan Railway Bureau is Going All Out</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Hankou, 25th] It is reported that the Pinghan Railway Bureau is currently concentrating its efforts on repairing the Yellow River Railway Bridge. The entire project will cost 60 million yuan, which has already been advanced by the railway bureau. The goal is to complete the project before the Yellow River floods. Furthermore, the overall repair project on the Yuehan Railway is continuing. The Wuchang to Qujiang section will officially resume train service on the first of next month (currently only temporary trains are running). The entire line is expected to be open to traffic before July 1.</p>
<h3>Shijiazhuang Decided to Change to a City</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Beiping, 25th] Shijiazhuang has decided to change its name to Shimen City. The first mayor will be Yin Wenchang. Yin has sent personnel to Shijiazhuang to actively make preparations.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Moves Machines Away from the Northeast; Worth 500 Million US Dollars; Yan'an Broadcasting Openly Attempts to Cover it Up; The Northeast Production Administration Formally Established in Shenyang</h3>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] According to estimates by American mining experts who have just returned to the capital from the Northeast, the Soviet Union has transported at least 500 million US dollars worth of machinery from the Northeast. It will take China at least two years to replace this machinery. The American experts represent a certain internationally renowned company and came to China to investigate mineral resources, reporting to the China Resources Committee. When they were in the southern part of the Nine Provinces of the East, they saw that the industrial areas had been dismantled and emptied. In Fushun alone, all the machinery had been dismantled and loaded onto trains, which were transported to Siberia, with a total of 2,200 train cars. Unless peace is restored in the Northeast, the vast area there will be of no value to China. Currently, transportation is extremely difficult due to the disruption caused by the war.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Shenyang, 25th] According to a Xinhua News Agency broadcast from Yan'an on the 21st, "There are more than 1,800 factories in the entire city of Shenyang, and all the equipment is intact and has not been damaged. It can be seen that the Kuomintang authorities' clamor that the Soviet army destroyed factories and transported away machinery is purely a fabrication." People in Shenyang who listened to this Yan'an broadcast were all extremely indignant, believing that the Yan'an side was truly dreaming in broad daylight and confusing black and white. The fact that the factories in Shenyang were moved away is an indisputable fact, known to both Chinese and foreigners. The United States, Britain, and other countries have even made representations to the Soviet Union about this matter. All the Chinese and foreign reporters who arrived in Shenyang, including reporters from Xinhua News Agency and Liberation Daily, have visited the factories in Tiexi and saw with their own eyes that only empty shells remained. Even the Soviet side has acknowledged this matter without attempting to cover it up. Unexpectedly, Yan'an openly covered up this matter, and its intentions can be imagined.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Northeast Production Administration of the Economic Commission of the Northeast Administrative Headquarters was formally established in Shenyang on the morning of the 24th, and a council was established with Wang Jiazhen, acting deputy director of the Economic Commission, serving as the acting chairman of the council and director of the administration. Mr. Wang stated: (1) He hopes that the Northeast production plan can be coordinated with the inland. (2) The work of industrial recovery in the Northeast is arduous. After taking over, he hopes that all parties will maintain a spirit of perseverance and clear division of responsibilities, so that industry can not only recover but also flourish. (3) Japanese technicians will be utilized, and excellent domestic experts will be selected to complete the recovery plan in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang's Entire Railway Can Be Repaired Within the Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Quzhou, 25th] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is currently actively repairing the rails from Hangzhou to Zhuji and the two sections from Zhuzhou, Pingxiang, Nanchang, and Jiujiang. More than a dozen bridges on the Nanchang-Shangrao and Quzhou-Jinhua sections have been completely destroyed, making it difficult to repair them in a short period of time. The Jiangshan to Quzhou and Zhuji to Jinhua sections are easier to repair. There are still many sleepers, but rails are lacking. The central government has decided to repair all the railways in Zhejiang Province within the month.</p>
<h3>The Stamped Legal Tender of the Northeast Will Be Recalled Ahead of Schedule</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Beiping, 25th] The stamped legal tender issued by the Northeast Administrative Headquarters was previously decided by the Ministry of Finance to be recalled within eighteen months. The Northeast related parties have requested the Ministry of Finance to recall it within three to six months, which is said to have been approved.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Unfolds Relief Work; Six Work Teams Established in Jiangsu Province; Relief Work in Hubei Province is Being Actively Strengthened</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 25th] In order to fully unfold relief work, the UNRRA Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch has decided that, in addition to directly handling relief work in the counties along the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line, it will also establish six base work teams in various important areas to preside over relief matters. (1) The Xuzhou Team is in charge of the eight counties of Fengxian, Pei County, Xiaoxian, Dangshan, Pi County, Tongshan, Suqian, and Suyu. (2) The Haizhou Team is in charge of the seven counties and cities of Yinyun, Donghai, Ganyu, Guannan, Lianshui, Shuyang, and Siyang. (3) The Taizhou Team is in charge of the six counties of Yancheng, Fuyang, Xinghua, Dongtai, Taizhou, and Jingjiang. (4) The Yangzhou Team is in charge of the six counties of Yangzhou, Huaiyin, Huaian, Gaoyou, Yizheng. (5) The Nantong Team is in charge of the five counties of Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, Qidong, and Jingjiang. (6) The Shanghai Team is in charge of the ten counties of Shanghai, Songjiang, Nanhui, Qingpu, Jinshan, Fengxian, Baoshan, Chuansha, Jiading, and Chongming.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Hankou, 25th] This reporter interviewed Zhou Cangbai, Director of the Hubei Relief Branch, today. According to him, relief work in Hubei Province has recently been actively strengthened. Since May, 2,000 tons of goods have been shipped to Hankou daily, totaling 60,000 tons per month. In order to provide relief to the disaster areas in northern Hubei, it has been decided to use 150 trucks to transport goods to that area starting next month. As for goods shipped from Hankou to Hunan, 500 tons per day will also be reached starting in May, and there may be further increases in the future. In addition, this branch has loaned more than 6,000 tons of food and wages for dike repair to Hubei Province. Recently, there has been an outbreak of plague in Yichang, resulting in more than sixty deaths. In order to prevent the disaster from spreading, personnel have been dispatched to carry a large number of medicines for rescue. In the current situation, there is no shortage of goods shipped to Hankou. The difficulties are that there are too few warehouses, making storage difficult, and the freight from Hankou to various disaster areas requires 2 billion yuan per month, for which there is still no appropriate solution.</p>
<h3>National Government Order</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing, 25th] The National Government issued the following order on the 25th: Special Envoy and Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Peru, Bao Junjian, is hereby appointed as the Plenipotentiary Representative for the exchange of instruments of ratification of the Sino-Ecuadorian Treaty of Friendship. This order.</p>
<h3>Commander of Changchun (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Fang Ren, dispatched from Shenyang</p>
<p>If Changchun is like this, what about Harbin, the famous city on the Songhua River to the north, Qiqihar, where the Nenjiang Provincial Government is located, northwest of Harbin, and where the Nenjiang River flows through? Needless to say, the situation there is that they are surrounded by enemies on all sides. The chairmen and mayors can only mingle in the government offices they have taken over. Saying this is not being harsh, but the range of power of the mayors and chairmen who have only taken over the government offices is really not as great as that of a small bao chief or even a jia chief in some places in the mainland. According to people close to Songjiang Provincial Chairman Guan Jiyu and Harbin Mayor Yang Chuoan, both Guan and Yang had no hobbies in the past, but now they both like to smoke paper cigarettes, especially Guan Jiyu—he has always been a relatively reserved person. In that kind of environment, his inner feelings are probably felt most deeply by him personally, or perhaps only those around him who are also deeply mired in an unspeakable situation can understand a little of what it is like. The news between Harbin and Changchun is still relatively accessible. You can make a long-distance phone call, and if the line has not been damaged, even if there is often interference and a lot of noise during the call, especially when the two places are exchanging news, you can still hear some news in the blur. In addition, unless the train is occupied for military transport and no passenger tickets are sold, people from the north and south can always flow to each other, and they can eventually exchange some news through oral messages. Dehui and Shuangcheng indeed have teams of unknown origin that inspect passing pedestrians. But people always have ways, and the inspectors are not all shrewd and capable. But Qiqihar is different. Since the Nenjiang Provincial Government left Changchun on January 8 together with the Songjiang Provincial Government, after staying in Harbin for only a few days, Chairman Peng Jiqun led the receiving personnel to Qiqihar. The news there has always been felt to be closed off. People living in Changchun feel this way, and it is conceivable that people in various places in the mainland feel even more at a loss.</p>
<p>On the 29th, the reporter left Changchun out of necessity. Changchun was lonely, monotonous, lacking in vitality, suffocating, and showing considerable unrest. When the reporter left, in addition to the military delegation led by Chief Dong Yanping, who would be working in Harbin with Marshal Malinovsky, the number of people left there was extremely small. In terms of units: the person in charge of the Manchurian Coal Building was Major General Wu Shiyu, and the person in charge of the Changchun Municipal Government was Li Zhaojunmai, and the manager of the Changchun Branch of the Central Bank was Wei Mengling. Only Central News Agency reporter Liu Zhuzhou accompanied the reporter.</p>
<p>Wu Shiyu and Lai Bingquan are both old Jiangxi folks, one in charge of transportation and the other in charge of general affairs. When they returned to Changchun last December, almost all of these two aspects of work were undertaken by them. The Changchun Municipal Government and the Changchun Branch of the Central Bank were the twin spirits who pioneered the receiving work in various parts of the Northeast after the so-called deadlock in the Northeast was broken. They started receiving work on December 22 last year, and after the news spread, it made many frowning people happy and encouraged people in Shenyang, Harbin and other places to actively carry out receiving work. Mayor Zhao Junmai studied military affairs in the United States and served as the mayor of Hengyang in the past. When he was in Hengyang, it was during the famous Battle of Hengyang during the War of Resistance. Therefore, when the situation was urgent, he said that he did not feel unfamiliar with such a scene, and he could still command and deal with it when necessary. Manager Wei Mengling moved from the Manchurian Coal Building to the Central Bank a few days before the reporter left Changchun in order to stabilize the hearts of his staff and the citizens. Banks seemed to be particularly noticed when rumors were rampant. Therefore, rumors often used banks as material, and after Manager Wei moved into the bank, he expressed his determination, making the rumor-mongers feel bored themselves. The Central News Agency originally had three people working in Changchun. Photojournalist Xuan Wenjie transferred to work in Shenyang, so only reporters Liu Zhuzhou and Zhong Henian were left in Changchun. They printed and distributed news releases with typewriters, providing news to Changchun newspapers. Therefore, Changchun newspapers were not as disorganized as those in Harbin and other places, publishing news that was not news. Their office hours were always from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm, and the time when Changchun was most able to walk around everywhere was all in this period, and they almost all spent it in the office. Many people in Changchun learned to dance, but they had no time to go to those places. On the 29th, Zhong Jun Henian left Changchun on official business, and as a result, only Liu Jun Zhuzhou was fighting alone. Liu Jun was determined to persevere to the end. He expressed in a telegram to a friend in Shenyang that he was "willing to fight to the last bullet (paper bullet)."</p>
<p>On the third day after the reporter left Changchun, on the night of April 1, fighting broke out in the western suburbs of Changchun! The city lights suddenly went out again. Then the situation became more and more urgent day by day. The Soviet army withdrew from Changchun on the 14th. The future of Changchun remains to be seen, and only facts can answer it. With a feeling of nostalgia, the reporter wishes Changchun and the friends in Changchun well!</p>
<h3>Beijing Conscripts Japanese Prisoners of War for Service, Completing Six Suburban Highways</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] More than 12,000 Japanese prisoners of war who were conscripted for service in this city will be sent back to their country on May 1. This batch of Japanese prisoners of war belongs to the 40th Division of the enemy army. They have been conscripted for labor service since February of this year, and have completed six suburban highways including the Huanhu, Baiguoshan, Tai (pingmen)-Yao (huamen), Yao-Yan (zi)he (banmen), and Xia (guan)-Yan highways. The restoration project of the three main roads in the city, including Hanzhong, Mochou, and Guanghuamen (to the airport), a total of 44.1 kilometers, the construction of the American army parking lot and the army headquarters sewer project, and the Qin Huai River dredging project and many other places, except for the Qin Huai River, all projects have been completed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau is currently preparing vehicles for the more than 12,000 Japanese prisoners of war who have been transported from various places and assembled in this city, and will transport them to Shanghai in batches starting on May 1.</p>
<h3>Zhao Jiaxiang Returns to Shenyang; It is Said that the Chairman is Concerned About the Current Situation in the Northeast and Instructs Him to Wait Quietly for a Solution Through Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Beiping, 25th] With the war in the Northeast raging fiercely between Sipingjie and Gongzhuling, Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Security Headquarters, flew to Shenyang by special plane on the morning of the 25th. Zhao said: After arriving in Chongqing, when he visited Chairman Chiang at noon on the 23rd, the Chairman inquired in detail about the situation in the Northeast, but did not express much about the military situation in the Northeast. The Chairman's intention is that the current situation in the Northeast should be waited for quietly to be resolved through mediation, and he instructed me to convey this intention to all the responsible persons in the Northeast and not to act rashly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Shenyang, 25th] Zhao Jiaxiang flew to Shenyang from Beiping on the 25th. It is said that Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the situation in the Northeast and is extraordinarily concerned about the compatriots in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] News from Beiping: The two armies of the KMT and the CCP have launched a fierce battle in Gongzhuling, north of Shenyang. The follow-up troops of the New First Army have arrived. The statement made by the Xinhua Branch of Beiping that the deputy commander of the 31st Division of the New First Army was injured is not accurate.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Dispatch from Beiping, 25th] Reports say that the "shock troops" of the New First Army broke through the strong defense line of the communist army in Gongzhuling and are advancing towards Changchun. They will arrive in Changchun within the next few days.</p>
<h3>Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen States Soviet Troops Should Withdraw from Dalian; Malinovsky Has Departed Harbin</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen stated today that he earnestly hopes Soviet troops will withdraw from Dalian within this month. It is reported that he has no information regarding the situation in Dalian, and the withdrawal date for Soviet troops from Northeast China does not include Dalian. "However, Dalian is part of China's territory, and we hope that Soviet troops will withdraw from the entire Northeast region within the month, in accordance with their promises." As for Harbin, it has been lost to the Chinese Communists; "Communist troops are already inside the Harbin city area." Soviet troops are scheduled to withdraw from Harbin today, but as of this evening, the National Government has not yet learned whether Soviet troops have withdrawn as scheduled.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 25th] Qualified Chinese and foreign sources stated today that the Soviet troops currently stationed in the southeastern part of the Nine Eastern Provinces are under the jurisdiction of the Red Army Supreme Command in North Korea and are not included in Marshal Malinovsky's plan to withdraw from the Northeast before the end of April. The same may be true of the Red Army troops stationed in Dalian. They know the precise boundaries of the so-called southeastern region of the Nine Eastern Provinces in detail. They also pointed out that the southeastern part of the Nine Eastern Provinces and Dalian are adjacent to the north bank of the Yalu River, which is the rear buffer zone for the Soviet troops stationed in Korea. It is said that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from this area depends on future Sino-Soviet negotiations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 25th] Today is the date for the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Harbin. However, since communicating with the area last night, no further telegrams have been received from Harbin as of now. It is still unknown whether Soviet troops have completely withdrawn. However, it is speculated that our military delegation may have left Harbin. Marshal Malinovsky left Harbin on the 24th, without the military delegation or local personnel accompanying him.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Shenyang, 25th] According to government officials who have retreated here, Communist troops have established political power in the villages near Harbin and have infiltrated the city several months ago. They are now preparing to take over the city's administration as soon as Soviet troops have completely withdrawn. Government troops are currently about 220 miles southwest of Harbin, in conflict with Communist troops in the Sipingjie area.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 25th] Communist Party sources in Beiping predicted today that Harbin will be taken over by the Communist Party's "Self-Defense Army." Soviet troops are scheduled to begin withdrawing from Harbin today and are expected to complete the withdrawal roughly by tomorrow. Cities and outposts surrounding Harbin, including its modern major airfield, are already in the hands of Communist troops, but as of yesterday, nominal control still belonged to Soviet troops. Meanwhile, government takeover personnel in Qiqihar, in view of the possibility that Communist troops will immediately take over after the Soviet withdrawal, have gone to Werbin, preparing to transfer to Shenyang. Both Nationalist and Communist sources previously stated that Harbin Mayor Yang Chuo'an had reached a tentative gentleman's agreement with the Communist troops surrounding Harbin, whereby he would continue to serve as mayor, while the Communist Party would appoint a deputy mayor to jointly maintain peace and order in Harbin. Recent news has not revealed whether Yang is still adhering to this agreement, continuing to serve as mayor, or is seeking to leave Harbin, like other government officials.</p>
<h3>Mediation Department Encounters Difficulties; Executive Group's Work Comes to a Standstill</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Niu Xianming, Deputy Chief of Staff on the government side of the Executive Headquarters, is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 26th, accompanied by Cai Zonglian, the newly appointed head of the Shenyang Central Group. It is said that the 31st Group of the Obstruction Prevention Department has gone to Yongnian to work. Rumors that the 31st Group has been dispatched to the Northeast are inaccurate, as the 30th Group is still in Shenyang as a reserve. Mu Weizhao Jiaxiang was originally the government leader of the Shenyang Central Group, but because Zhao is the Chief of Staff of the Security Commander's Office and is very busy, Cai Zonglian, who was newly transferred from Nanjing, has taken over.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 25th] Government, Communist, and American personnel participating in the work of the Beiping Mediation Executive Headquarters, in separate talks with Associated Press reporters, all admitted that their mission to end the civil war and reorganize the army is currently impossible to advance. Approximately thirty executive groups are currently distributed throughout China, from Hainan Island in the south to Sipingjie in the north, but the Beiping Executive Headquarters is filled with an atmosphere of stagnation, awaiting developments in Chongqing. The major difficulties faced by the Executive Headquarters today are as follows: (1) The inability of Chongqing to stop new conflicts; (2) The paralysis of the executive groups sent to the Northeast; (3) The failure to reach an agreement on repairing the destroyed railways; (4) The inability to lift the sieges of many cities in North China. There are 633 American personnel in the Executive Headquarters, which may soon increase to about 1,000. At present, the Executive Headquarters hopes to obtain new life from the Chongqing leadership in order to complete its mission.</p>

It is said that there are still dozens of representatives in Nanjing who have not yet registered.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The registration procedures for National Assembly representatives are extremely cautious. Forms are filled out, stamps are affixed, and signatures are made as many as five or six times. Documents are also submitted for verification, and photographs are checked before a silver circular badge, a red silk ribbon, and a pass with a photograph of the representative are obtained. Then, meal tickets, barber tickets, and bath tickets are collected. Each person can receive 90 meal tickets to eat at the restaurants designated by the conference, two meals per person per day, estimated to be usable for 45 days. After completing the registration procedures, representatives who do not intend to find their own accommodation can be picked up at any time by the 50 people at the conference's transportation reception station. There is talk that the conference will be postponed to May 15th or 20th. Therefore, many of the vocational representatives who have already registered plan to take time to go back and take care of official and personal matters, especially lawyers who are unwilling to sacrifice too much of their careers. Among the representatives who registered today, most were from Anhui Province. A total of 82 representatives arriving in Nanjing have gone to this newspaper's Nanjing office at 145 Yuping Road to subscribe to the newspaper.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] Hong Lanyou, Secretary of the National Assembly Preparatory Office, declared today that the office is currently actively carrying out preparatory work.

<h3>Pan Gongzhan and Others Host National Assembly Representatives Staying in Shanghai; Soliciting Opinions on Postponing the National Assembly</h3>
<p>In view of the approaching date of the National Assembly, Pan Gongzhan, a member of the Central Committee, Yang Xiaotian, Chairman of the Special Party Department of the Chinese Seamen, and Wu Shaoshu, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, issued invitations to National Assembly representatives staying in Shanghai to hold a tea party at the New Life Club at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to foster relationships and solicit opinions on the draft constitution and various current issues. More than 20 National Assembly representatives staying in Shanghai, including He Yuanming, Wang Qizhang, Liu Zhidang, Hu Jing'an, Pan Bingqing, Niu Jingting, Ding Zhongying, Xi Yushu, Zhu Fengwei, Yu Huai'ren, Chen Guanying, Chen Chaoxiu, Tang Chengzong, Tang Qi, Wang Jiyi, Chen Tingrui, Zhu Zhaokui, Qin Liankui, Ye Xianggao, Wang Renlin, and Zhou Xuexiang, Zhu Xuefan, etc., were invited to attend. First, Yang Xiaotian and Wu Shaoshu delivered speeches explaining that the purpose of the reception was to solicit opinions on the draft constitution, because the draft constitution is the fundamental law of the future country. The National Assembly will have a very short session, and representatives must exchange opinions before the meeting in order to produce a perfect constitution. At the same time, they must also make more preparations for the agenda proposals. Although the conference has been postponed, the preparatory work must still be stepped up. The representatives then expressed their opinions, focusing on the postponement of the National Assembly. Xi Yushu believes that the government has been sincere in holding the National Assembly to implement constitutional government. The date of May 5th was decided last year and a formal notice has been issued. It is regrettable that it has been postponed again because a few parties have not submitted their list of representatives. Pan Gongzhan believes that although the National Assembly has been postponed, the date of the convening will not be too far away. We can go to Nanjing first to prepare for the meeting and focus on studying the draft constitution. In addition, Tang Qi, Wang Jiyi, Chen Guanying, and Liu Zhixun also expressed their opinions. Summarizing the opinions of all parties, they unanimously advocated inquiring with the Central Government in the name of the National Assembly Liaison Association as to why the meeting was postponed and when it would be held, and also expressed the hope that the Communist Party and the Democratic League and other minority parties would show sincerity in participating in the National Assembly. Finally, it was decided to submit the opinions expressed by everyone to the National Assembly Liaison Association for further discussion, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Seizure of Traitor Property Awaits Execution After Judgment: The handling of the legally seized property of Chinese traitors before a verdict is reached has garnered significant attention from local figures. The Procuratorate of the Local Court of this county recently received instructions from the Jiangsu High Procuratorate, which in turn received Directive No. 2002 of the Jing Zhi Xing Zi [Capital 指 刑 字] issued on April 10th of this year by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The directive stipulates that all legally seized property of Chinese traitors should be executed after a verdict of confiscation is finalized. Before execution, no one is allowed to use the property, unless there is a definite risk of loss or damage, in which case Articles 140, Paragraph 1, and 141 of the Criminal Procedure Law may be followed. Any unauthorized movement of the property will result in the executing agency bearing full responsibility. The directive emphasizes that the case is not yet finalized, and whether or not confiscation will occur is still pending a final decision. Furthermore, the inventory of the seized property has already been reported and may not be arbitrarily altered. If seized property is forcibly occupied or used by the military, and the executing agency is unable to prevent the loss, it should immediately provide the military unit's number, the name of its commanding officer, the circumstances of the loss, and detailed amounts, and report them for verification and instructions. Upon receiving the order, the Procuratorate has notified the Changzhou branch of the Jiangsu Bureau for Handling Enemy and Traitor Property accordingly.</p>

<p>Military and Political Leaders Jointly Visit Cheng</p>
<p>Communist forces in northern Jiangsu have been very active recently, making counties in southern Jiangsu extremely important. Tang Enbo, Commander of the First Pacification District, and Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, arrived in Cheng by special train from Wuxi around 10:00 AM on the 22nd. Accompanying them were Song Shaojiao from the Pacification Supervision Group and Fang Zhinong, Secretary of the Provincial Government, among others. They first went to the regimental headquarters of the 237th Regiment of the 79th Division to listen to reports on military affairs from Division Commander Wen Li and Regimental Commander Hu Limin. Subsequently, Chairman Wang went to the county government. As County Magistrate Fang had gone to Jin Province, he was received by Secretary Sun Juncai and the heads of various departments. Chairman Wang then convened a meeting of personnel from various agencies and gave instructions. The main points included the need to establish security, improve the Baojia system, and purge undesirable elements in villages and towns, requiring joint guarantee certificates. Special attention should be paid to clearing up household registrations and requisitioning military grain. In the future, if there are quotas assigned, they must be fulfilled immediately, with the price paid at 13,000 yuan per shi [unit of dry volume]. Given the local financial difficulties, a locally adapted tax may be temporarily levied. In the future, local security should rely on the joint efforts of the Party, government, military, and people, and genuine assistance should be provided. After lunch, the two military and political leaders, Tang and Wang, took the Minquan warship to Jingjiang and Nantong counties in northern Jiangsu for inspection, providing instructions to military and political leaders. They may also make a trip to Changshu before returning separately to Zhenjiang and Wuxi.</p>
<p>Haining</p>
<p>A Record of the Tragic Murder of a Virtuous Monk</p>
<p>性照Xingzhao, the abbot of the Mituo Temple in Haining, usually devoted himself to Buddhist scriptures and practiced what he preached. Previously, he was ordered by County Magistrate Gu to establish a national primary school within the temple, serving as its principal and assisting in underground work. At the time, local thugs Wang Fuqing, Wu Tingchun, Zhang Guanrong, Zhao Changlin, and others colluded with enemy puppet secret agents to extort and blackmail, committing all sorts of evil deeds, and were quite incompatible with 性照Xingzhao. In July of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], they reported 性照Xingzhao's various anti-Japanese activities to the enemy special high command, leading to his arrest. He was released on bail thanks to the joint guarantee of various businesses in Xiashi. Wang Fuqing and his gang dared to collude with five or six thugs armed with weapons to surround and capture him at the Mituo Temple. Fortunately, 性照Xingzhao was out and escaped, and he was forced to take refuge at the Guanzong Temple in Ningbo. After the victory, he was ordered by County Magistrate Gu to return to the Mituo Temple. Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 PM on that night, the thugs Wang Fuqing, Wang Tingchun, Zhang Guanrong, Zhao Changlin, Yu Furong, Wu Weiqin, Wu Weijun, and others, armed with handguns and sharp knives, swarmed into the temple. 性照Xingzhao was unable to escape and died amidst the chaos of blades. They hid the corpse, intending to cover up the crime. It has been more than half a year, and the county government has detained Wang Fuqing, but the other perpetrators remain at large, and the whereabouts of the corpse are still unknown.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Path to Resolving Labor-Capital Disputes</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>There are three elements of production: besides land, labor and capital are considered the main components. At a time when people's livelihoods are declining and construction is just beginning, the continuous unresolved labor-capital disputes are a misfortune for the production sector. These disputes mainly focus on wage issues, and various parties repeatedly encourage mutual understanding and coordination. However, both labor and capital hold firmly to their respective positions. One side claims that prices are soaring and wages are insufficient to cover expenses, while the other side claims that costs are too high and they cannot afford to bear the financial burden. Thus, those who advise continue to advise, and those who argue continue to argue. Therefore, the study of wage standards has indeed become a serious issue at present. Economists have a common saying that economic matters should be resolved with economic policies. The coordination of labor and capital, and the standards for wages, are essential elements of production and distribution theory. We can seek a path to resolve the matter through research.</p>
<p>Wages, also known as labor pay, should be determined by what number? Scholars have different opinions. Summarizing the main points, the following kinds can be obtained:</p>
<p>(1) Production Cost Theory: Proponents of this theory state that labor can increase the value of production by a certain amount, which can be used as the standard for wages. Since the value of production often changes due to market competition, wages must also rise and fall accordingly. In the United States today, both prices and wages are still under government control. Every time wages increase, the production index and product prices also increase accordingly, based on this theory. However, it must be noted that if government control is not strict enough, wages may not increase in equal proportion when profits greatly increase. Conversely, if profits fall, or even result in losses, laborers may not be able to concede accordingly, except by shutting down the business. Therefore, while the theory is beautiful, its practical implementation is quite difficult.</p>
<p>(2) Minimum Living Expenses Theory: There is an old so-called Iron Law of Wages, which states that as the population increases, wages decrease, and the income of laborers must fall to the point where they can barely maintain their minimum living expenses. This theory does not seem to correspond with the facts. According to the statistics of various countries, except for industrial decline and labor surplus, general wages are gradually increasing. However, when workers cannot maintain their minimum living standard, they will inevitably seek other livelihoods and cannot be content with their profession, which is only a matter of reason. Therefore, researchers of social policy often advocate that the government should provide additional relief to prevent them from becoming destitute. This responsibility cannot be borne by the production sector which is already fragmented.</p>
<p>(3) Fund Theory: Scholars have a so-called Wages Fund Theory, which refers to the total amount of labor pay that the production sector can afford to provide in a given society during a given period, which serves as the wage fund for all laborers. This is based on the same principle as the Production Cost Theory. Proponents of this theory often state that laborers who want to increase their wages should first reduce the number of people participating in labor. However, we should know that if there is no progress in labor technology, then the reduction in the number of people will result in a decline in production, and the labor fund will inevitably decrease accordingly. Labor unions may prevent the entry of new workers as a form of self-defense, but the result may not be beneficial.</p>
<p>(4) Marginal Utility Theory: Marginal Utility, states that each unit in the economy should maintain its corresponding differential profit. Therefore, consumers have a surplus (Consumer's Surplus), savers have a surplus (Saver's Surplus), and producers have a surplus (Producer's Surplus). According to this theory, both labor and capital should be able to maintain a corresponding surplus and obtain corresponding protection. However, this can only be said for industries that are running smoothly, and not for those that are losing money and reducing payments. If one wants to adjust this shortcoming, the government should levy heavy taxes on production businesses that have excessive profits, to prepare for relief for other industries or unemployed workers in the future. The government should also take measures to suppress entrepreneurs who are wasteful, to avoid infringing on the marginal benefits of laborers.</p>
<p>(5) Exploitation Theory: This is the so-called exploitation of surplus value of workers by capitalists (Exploitation Theory). Proponents of this theory state that the wages given to labor by capitalists are merely the residual amount after deducting the surplus value from the value of their production, their focus being on the capital side infringing on the labor side's margin. Orthodox economists also do not consider such behavior to be reasonable; researchers of social policy also advocate restricting capital to prevent this exploitation. During the war, the control of prices and wages by various countries aimed to achieve balance, so that both capital and labor could obtain corresponding distribution. Unfortunately, this kind of control method cannot be implemented with ease in countries where statistics are not complete enough and administration lacks efficiency.</p>
<p>(6) Monopoly Theory: The meaning of monopoly is close to monopolization (Monopoltheorie). Labor can also unite to suppress capital to raise wages. This kind of class monopoly will inevitably lead to class struggle. Therefore, there is also the so-called Power Principle. The business is to deal with the other party with force, coordination is not the question, further away from the standard that can be found economically, and it only causes disputes without regard to the development of the production business, which is not a proper method.</p>
<p>The above mentioned theories, except for the latter two, which come from hostile psychology and are not worth discussing, all emphasize the production business's capacity to bear the costs, and the measurement of its burden capacity takes the profit of the product as the object. In other words, the labor to obtain wages is to distribute the production product to the entrepreneur as a production property, and not to accept the entrepreneur's relief funds. This is the self-esteem that the labor side should have, and it is also the spirit of cooperation that the entrepreneur should have. Here we can find the standard of wages. Some say that the labor life should be gradually improved, so that the social livelihood can be stabilized, which is indeed worth admiring. However, at a time when international trade is smooth and world prices are gradually balanced, the price of production products has to be controlled by the market, so the burden of wages has to have a maximum limit. Exceeding this limit will make the market occupied, the industry overturned, and the social livelihood will inevitably suffer. Today's talk about wage standards focuses on pre-war wages, thinking that this is the base salary, which can be adjusted by referring to the cost of living index. I don't know that the current situation of the industry, except for a very few, has fallen many times more than before the war, so this can be used as a social policy, but it cannot be used as an economic production policy. Moreover, in terms of social policy, this responsibility cannot be supported by the fragile production industry alone. Furthermore, all production businesses that cannot afford better wages may be due to poor management policies, or due to poor production equipment, or due to uneconomical use of labor. The manufacturers should be aware of these situations and strive to improve, and not argue about wages in the current situation. As for the preciousness of labor, it is able to increase the value of the production product. If the technology is poor and the efficiency is too low, then the instinct is not exhausted, and it is not possible to simply seek the improvement of life. Therefore, both capital and labor should each rectify and seek progress, then the cooperation in production will be easy, and the dispute in distribution will be eliminated. In the advanced countries' labor management, the selection of employees and the criteria for dispatching matters are not afraid of labor costs, and they try their best to be cautious in advance. After they have been employed, the training of technology, the facilities of health care, and the rewards for excellent workers are not spared to improve them on a daily and monthly basis, so their production index and labor life advance together. Looking back at our country, when hiring, it is often too hasty, or sells favors, or greedy bargains. After taking office, they complain about the employer's lack of preferential treatment. The cooperation between the two sides is too insincere, so the wind blows and the grass moves, and the labor tide rises. I believe that the frequent occurrence of labor-capital disputes, its symptoms may be at this end. If you don't do your best from the root, but only expect the mediation of the authorities, this is truly abandoning the root and pursuing the tip.</p>

<h3>The Foreign Ministers' Conference Opened Yesterday; Molotov and Bevin Both Arrived; the Success or Failure of the Secret Conference Is of Great Importance</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 25th (Broadcast): The Foreign Ministers' Conference opened in Paris at 4:00 PM today (midnight Shanghai time). Molotov arrived on time, and the agenda has been drafted by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The French diplomatic community is very optimistic about this conference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 25th (United Press)]: The four-power foreign ministers held a conference in Paris today to break the stalemate between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain. The four foreign ministers will meet in secret at 4:00 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) in the Luxembourg Palace, a historical landmark in France, sitting around a table covered with green tablecloth. If the conference is successful, it should be able to draft the basic format of the peace treaty, and the results of the conference can also provide a blueprint for establishing future diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries. As for whether various issues can be fully agreed upon at that time, there is no optimistic hope. Based on the preliminary discussions at the four-power foreign deputies' conference held in London, the opinions among the countries are divided and far apart. These divided opinions may be difficult to compromise on certain issues.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th]: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived here by plane from Berlin at 5:26 PM today to attend the Western Foreign Ministers' Conference. Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky accompanied him. US Secretary of State Byrnes had arrived earlier than Molotov.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th]: Foreign Minister Bevin took a "York" transport plane from Northolt Airport at 10:37 AM today and flew to Paris to attend the four-power foreign ministers' conference. Before leaving, he said: He did not know how long he would be abroad. The plane taken by Foreign Minister Bevin this time was the same one he took to attend the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference last year.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th]: Today, according to sources close to the four parties, the Trieste dispute has actually reached an agreement, stipulating that the port facing the Adriatic Sea should remain in Italy, and its inland area should be ceded to Yugoslavia. This solution was agreed upon by the investigation team of the four foreign ministers' deputies' conference after conducting an on-site investigation and can be submitted to the four foreign ministers' conference for review.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th]: When the four foreign ministers hold the conference, the Austrian issue may be included in the agenda. The Dardanelles Strait issue, that is, the amendment of the Montreux Convention, or the Mediterranean issue related to the Italian peace treaty, may be discussed together. How to dispose of the Italian colonies will be resolved by the foreign ministers' conference and then submitted to the peace conference for a final decision.</p>
<h3>Plan to Investigate Spain Suddenly Opposed by France and Italy; Amendment Proposed to Limit Investigation Opportunities; Security Council Met Yesterday to Discuss</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 25th]: Australia's plan for the United Nations to send an investigation team to Spain was suddenly opposed by France today, unexpectedly advocating limiting the opportunity for this investigation. At 3:00 PM today (4:00 AM Friday Shanghai time), the Security Council will reopen the debate on Australia's proposed plan to visit Spain for investigation. For most of the past 24 hours, there has been widespread belief that France is seeking an agreement in advance on the issue of amending Australia's proposal, and it is believed that Australia's proposal guarantees unanimous passage in the Security Council. However, it was revealed this morning that French representative Parodi had held secret talks with most of the representatives yesterday, trying to get all parties to support his proposed amendment. According to the amendment, the investigation team should be stationed in New York and all statements and documents related to the Spanish issue should be reviewed and processed in New York. The response to the French proposal was rapid. The Australian delegation is unwilling to make formal public criticisms, but diplomatic sources revealed that the Australian chief representative will vehemently oppose it. Some Security Council personnel believe that there are two reasons why France wants to keep the investigation team in New York, especially not wanting the team to enter French territory: (1) There are hundreds of thousands of Spanish Republicans in southern France; (2) Fearing that the various left-wing parties in France will exert pressure on the team, making it difficult for the French government.</p>
<h3>More Than 30,000 People Killed by Cars Annually in the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th]: The United States has the highest number of car accident deaths, with 40,000 people dying in 1941. However, according to the estimates of the US Safety Council, if calculated based on the current car accident death rate, there will be 38,000 deaths under the wheels this year. President Truman has scheduled a national conference in Washington in May to discuss methods to prevent car accidents.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops in Iranian Azerbaijan are Withdrawing; There are Still Many "Democratic Army" Members; Representatives of Azerbaijan Will Go to Tehran for Negotiations Within Days</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 25th (Broadcast): Azerbaijan has scheduled to send a delegation to Tehran within one to two days to negotiate with the Iranian central government. A spokesman for the Iranian government said: The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Azerbaijan is progressing smoothly and is expected to be completed before May 6.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tehran, 24th (United Press)]: According to British official sources: Soviet troops have all withdrawn from Tabriz, but most of the Soviet civilians have not yet withdrawn, and many soldiers in "Democratic Army" uniforms are walking the streets, all of whom cannot speak the Azerbaijani dialect. British and American officials have confirmed that the Soviet headquarters has been withdrawn, but it is not known whether the Soviet commander himself has withdrawn. Although the Soviet troops have withdrawn, the "Democratic Army" can still be seen in Tabriz and often conducts exercises and bombardments in the nearby mountains. Political figures believe that the withdrawal of Soviet troops cannot be fully completed before May 6, and there are still Soviet troops stationed in other parts of Azerbaijan. The Soviet headquarters has now apparently moved to an area near the Soviet border.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 25th]: The chieftain of a major Kurdish tribe last night criticized Qazi Muhammad, the leader of the Kurdish Independent Republic, saying that he is "surrounded by Soviet agents and listens only to Soviet orders in every move." The major tribes no longer support this independence movement. According to recent reports, the Soviet troops who withdrew from Miyandoab, an important thoroughfare in Kurdistan, have now returned to their original locations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th]: Conservative MP General Haithter, who recently accompanied Labour MP Treit on a visit to Iran, wrote in the Daily Telegraph, advocating that a committee of the United Nations be sent to Azerbaijan, Iran, to supervise the determination of the province's future status and prevent the application of Soviet pressure.</p>
<h3>British Delegation Returns to New Delhi; Negotiations Enter an Important Stage; Success or Failure Will Be Known in Ten Days; Gandhi Urges Soldiers to Assist in the Revival of Agriculture and Industry</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 25th (Broadcast): The British Cabinet delegation has returned to New Delhi, and the negotiations have entered the final important stage. Its success or failure will be known in ten days. Officials are currently keeping silent.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th]: Alexander, the Secretary of State for the Colonies and a member of the British Cabinet delegation, recently wrote to a friend from India, stating that the Indian issue may not be resolved within the expected time. But in fact, the Indian issue should be resolved as soon as possible, otherwise widespread riots will occur, affecting world peace. The delegation is very busy meeting people in India and collecting a lot of evidence, but it is difficult to reach a common solution because the views of all parties are very different.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 25th]: Gandhi yesterday urged soldiers to adopt several of the fourteen construction plans without conflicting with military discipline. Briefly stated, soldiers can spin, learn papermaking, and other rural handicrafts. When soldiers are not fighting, they have plenty of free time to engage in various activities to win India's freedom.</p>
<h3>Britain Urges Poland to Hold Elections Soon</h3>
<p>US Loans Poland Ninety Million Dollars</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast: The British government today issued a note to the Polish government, urging it to hold free elections as soon as possible, so as to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Potsdam Declaration.</p>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 24th Dispatch] The State Department announced tonight that the US government has granted a loan of ninety million US dollars to Poland. Poland guarantees that it will hold free and unfettered elections this year in accordance with the Potsdam and Yalta Declarations.</p>
<h3>Four-Party Negotiations Fail, Japanese Political Situation Chaotic</h3>
<p>[Reconstruction Daily, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch] After the collapse of the Shidehara Cabinet, the Japanese political situation remains chaotic today. Liberal Party Secretary-General Kono visited Socialist Party Secretary-General Katayama three times yesterday, but gained nothing due to the Socialist Party's firm stance. This morning, Kono visited Katayama again. As a result of the meeting, it was decided that according to the Socialist Party's new proposal, the issue of the next government will be negotiated jointly by the Liberal, Socialist, Cooperative, and Communist Parties.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch] The Socialist Party convened a joint meeting of representatives from the Liberal, Cooperative, and Communist parties this afternoon to discuss the formation of a cabinet. Although all parties were united in opposing Shidehara (President of the Progressive Party), internal disagreements over who should become prime minister led to no agreement being reached.</p>
<h3>British Dominion Prime Ministers' Conference Seeks Broad Basis for Cooperation; Disagreements on Rebuilding the British Imperial Cabinet</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 24th Dispatch] According to responsible sources tonight, the British Imperial Prime Ministers' Conference has decided that before any Pacific base is ceded to the United States, the defense policy of that area should be discussed with the United States.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 24th United Press Dispatch] Those who advocate for closer unity within the British Empire today expressed their welcome to the proposal of the New Zealand representative attending the British Dominion Conference. This proposal calls for the re-establishment of a "Imperial Cabinet" of twenty members, which will have the power to discuss British Imperial defense, trade tariffs, and special treatment, and submit its agreed reports to the British and Dominion parliaments. New Zealand and Australia enthusiastically support this proposal, while the support of the Union of South Africa is clearly problematic. South Africa opposes the establishment of such a British United Nations conference, as it may infringe upon its rights vis-à-vis London. The South African Parliament has always had the right to decide on neutrality in future wars. It is believed that the Canadian government largely agrees with South Africa's views. According to some sources, on the issue of control, South African Prime Minister Smuts insists on the principle of "Greater Africanism."</p>
<h3>Lincoln's Manuscripts to Be Published Next Year</h3>
<p>[United Press, Springfield, 24th Dispatch] According to the famous historian Monaghan, the long-awaited manuscripts of President Lincoln will be published next year. These manuscripts have been stored in the Library of Congress since Lincoln's son donated them to the government in 1923. He stipulated that the manuscripts should not be printed until twenty-one years after his death.</p>
<h3>Philippine Elections, Preliminary Results Announced</h3>

<p>[United Press, Manila, 25th Dispatch] According to preliminary results from one-fifth of the precincts in the Philippine election, Roxas is currently leading by 80,000 votes. Incumbent President Osmeña is leading in twelve provinces, but Roxas is ahead of Osmeña in twenty-three provinces. Whether Osmeña has any hope of being elected will depend on the election results in remote rural areas.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Scientifically Prepared Food Shipped to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd Special Dispatch] San Francisco: The first ships carrying scientifically prepared food under UNRRA have arrived in San Francisco harbor and will be transferred to China. The food consists of 50% soybean pulp and 50% flour, with added salt, peanuts, onions, powder, and fish oil for flavoring.</p>

<h3>US Aircraft Repeatedly Shot at by Soviets in Austrian Territory; US Files Second Protest</h3>
<p>[United Press, Vienna, 25th Dispatch] It was learned last night that a US aircraft was again shot at by Soviet aircraft. US Commander Clark has filed a second protest with the Soviet military authorities. The two shootings occurred only one day apart. The first occurred last Monday at the Tulln airfield outside Vienna (see previous issue of this newspaper), and the second occurred near Linz on Sunday. According to an announcement by General Clark's headquarters last night, four Soviet aircraft surrounded another US C-47 aircraft between Munich and Vienna on Sunday. Two of the Soviet aircraft fired shots at the US aircraft, but did not hit it.</p>
<h3>Huge Quantities of Japanese Gold and Silver Ingots Buried at the Bottom of Tokyo Bay; US Military Builds Cofferdam to Begin Excavation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] Japanese officials buried huge quantities of gold and silver ingots at the bottom of the sea next to a shipyard in Tokyo Bay last July. This treasure has now been discovered. The US Navy used several large pumps this afternoon to drain all the water from the side of the dock. US sailors, under the command of Moore, will begin clearing three to four feet of mud from the bottom of the dock tomorrow in order to excavate the treasure beneath. Divers have already recovered 134 gold and silver ingots during the construction of the cofferdam, about fifty feet from where Lieutenant Nelson recovered the first ingot a month ago. According to reports from Nelson and Japanese divers, two piles of gold and silver ingots were found, each ingot measuring twenty feet in length and width, stacked in the mud like paving stones. However, only one ingot has been recovered, which is said to contain silver. The person who led Nelson to the site was a Japanese informant who claimed that Japanese officials directed workers to throw the gold ingots into the water last July, and that he was one of the workers. Later, when some workers learned that what they had thrown was gold and silver, officials warned them not to reveal the secret, saying that the buried treasure was to be used to "build a great Japan." It is said that the gold ingots are worth about 30 billion Japanese yen, or about 2 billion US dollars. However, according to the information obtained by the US side, there is not that much. No fewer than several thousand gold ingots were thrown into the dock, carried on two trucks, but divers report that the ingots are scattered over a wide area, so it is speculated that even more ingots were thrown into the water, unseen by the informant.</p>
<h3>From the Old World to the New World: Miscellaneous Writings En Route Across the Atlantic</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>The three thousand two hundred miles of sea journey across the Atlantic Ocean divides the Western world into two very different parts. After six years of arduous war, many are lamenting the "decline of Europe," and many young Europeans are looking forward to the other side of the ocean, where there is freedom, hope, and, most importantly, the material enjoyment that Westerners value most. When the William Mary Victory troopship I was on sailed out of the port of Le Havre, France, American veterans cheered, while young French boys and girls gazed at the last piece of land of the Old World, staring, silent, and finally smiling.</p>
<p>Many far-sighted international observers are worried about the future of France. On the ship, an American sergeant named Henry said very frankly: "Although I have never been to China, I know the situation in China is as chaotic as in France. However, I have never met a Chinese person who is not confident about China's future, and I have never met a Chinese person who is not proud to be Chinese. The French are not like that." I found proof of Henry's words the next day, and that was the young Frenchman, John Borah, who was traveling on the same ship as me and sleeping next to me.</p>
<p>John was a corporal in the French army, but "the life of a French soldier is worse than that of a rich man's dog." Therefore, after three years, John not only did not want to re-enlist, but he decided to leave France: "I can be a citizen of any country, why must I rely on France?" He also said: "If I cannot obtain American citizenship, I am determined to go to Australia. The Australian government has already requested two and a half million immigrants from Western European countries. I can speak English, so of course there is no problem!"</p>
<p>The American army distributed surplus military supplies on the ship. Like many other civilian passengers, John had more than a dozen chocolate bars, two cans of American peanuts, and two packs of cigarettes. He jumped up with excitement. In the evening, he put the peanuts next to his pillow, determined to eat them until he fell asleep. In the morning, as soon as he opened his eyes, he started eating peanuts again. He told me: "That's why I'm determined to leave France." I smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>France's poverty is now not only a problem for France itself, but also a very serious part of the European political problem. In last winter's provisional parliamentary elections, the Communist Party won the most votes. A reporter from the Paris Soir told me: "The reason why the Communist Party won the most votes is because women all voted for it." It is said that the French Communist Party's propaganda to women has been quite successful. They told the ladies and misses of Paris: Aren't you worried about not having meat, bread, silk stockings, or clothing? Elect the Communist Party, and the Communist Party will solve your difficulties! The reporter from the Paris Soir said: "This June, there will be elections for formal parliamentarians." He predicted that the Communist Party would definitely not win again.</p>
<p>Because my last trip to Paris was too rushed, I did not spend much effort studying the future elections in France. However, from any point of view, the current serious economic problems in France are enough to affect the entire European political situation. The US-France major loan has not yet been successful, and Leon Blum, the "founding father" of the Socialist Party, actually ran to Washington with his old life. If the loan is successful, the Gouin cabinet can continue, and the Socialist Party may still be able to be on good terms with everyone in the next election. If the loan fails, perhaps the situation in France will change drastically. However, according to insiders, the United States also needs a period of "wait-and-see," to observe what kind of evolution France itself will have in the future.</p>
<p>Because there is such a discrepancy, both sides of the New and Old Worlds are scattered with various terrible resentments. Moscow announced last month that it would supply France with 500,000 tons of wheat. The Communist Minister of Transportation exaggeratedly dispatched France's only two transport ships to the Black Sea to load the wheat. A small newspaper in Paris wrote humorously: "Is the price of each grain of wheat equivalent to a vote?" The French laughed when they saw it.</p>
<p>I asked many of the French civilian passengers on the ship. A banker stroked his beard and said, "The Communist Party will never win again. General de Gaulle will rise again sooner or later!" Another young Frenchman disagreed with these words. He said: "De Gaulle won't do, Gouin is an idiot, and Leon Blum himself is a big capitalist. His house is full of gold bars." I asked him if he had seen it with his own eyes? He stuck out his tongue, and after a long silence, said: "I heard others say it!"</p>
<p>France is truly a "naive" nation beyond belief. In French history, there has never been a national saint or hero. Many French people may admire Napoleon, but Napoleon was once rejected by the international community. In the era of Clemenceau, France once dominated the world, but the French said that if there had been no Clemenceau, there would have been no disaster in 1940. Many bronze statues in Paris, France, are of writers, poets, and musical masters. French stamps and banknotes are printed with French beauties. "A king will rise every five hundred years," but in French history, there has never been a "king."</p>
<p>The lack of a "king" in democratic politics has created a chaotic political situation in France. From World War I to World War II, the changes in the French cabinet were rare in any democratic country. De Gaulle wanted to change from the previous cabinet system to a presidential system, and a fairly centralized presidential system, but was ousted from power by the provisional parliament. The day after the Gouin cabinet came to power, prices rose three to four times. The black market US dollar in Paris jumped from 200 francs to one to 400 to one. The Gouin cabinet's first shot was to tighten finances. Almost half of the government personnel were laid off. Those who were laid off became unemployed, and those who were not laid off became impoverished. Prices rose, but the salaries of civil servants did not rise, which was reflected in society as laxity, disorder, and low administrative efficiency and work efficiency. The day I left Le Havre, I went to a passport office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to apply for an exit visa. The civil servant picked up the seal and stamped it without asking any questions. After stamping it, he chatted with me, put the seal into his large briefcase, and asked me:</p>
<p>"Is this your first time in the port? Have you visited the city here?"</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>He said that he was willing to take me on a tour of the streets. When I followed him out of the office, there was still an hour and a half before closing time. I was worried about those who came after me: if another person came to apply for an exit visa, what would they do?</p>
<p>On the way, he told me that he was the head of a family of five, and that his salary was not enough to make ends meet. It was not easy to find a side job in Le Havre. I asked him if there were any French merchant ships in the port. He smiled bitterly: "There's nothing left, it's all American!"</p>
<p>In fact, there are not many American ships in the Atlantic Ocean, and even fewer American merchant ships. The William Mary Victory I was on was a maritime transport ship built during the war as part of President Roosevelt's "Two-Ocean Naval Expansion Plan." I asked the person in charge of the ship if it could be converted into a merchant ship in the future. He said: The United States has no intention of developing maritime transport business in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The Atlantic shipping industry is still in the hands of the British. The British Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, at over 60,000 tons, are still the "titans" of merchant shipping worldwide. Each trip from Southampton, England, to New York, or from New York to England, carries nearly ten thousand passengers, and even more troops. The ships have ballrooms, theaters, and swimming pools. Because the ships are large, one does not feel the pain of boredom at sea. It is said that the British shipping industry was very sad about the Queen Mary transporting American troops. The reason is: American soldiers often used knives to cut the tables or bulkheads, and picked up a small piece to take back to the United States as a souvenir. They believe that being able to ride the Queen Mary once in a lifetime is something to remember for the rest of one's life. This time, the personnel of the London embassy who were participating in the United Nations agencies all went to the United States on the Queen Mary. Mr. Bao Huaguo also took this ship from England to New York.</p>
<p>Secondly, Norway's maritime business is trying to catch up and recover. Shortly after Germany surrendered, several Norwegian merchant ships revived shipping between the United States and Europe. Recently, Norway is negotiating a loan from the United States to purchase ships and build merchant ships in the United States with all the loan money. In Paris, I met the former consul in Paris, who said: Soon, Norway will have ships sailing to the Far East.</p>
<p>Shipping competition is the prelude to trade competition. In the United Kingdom, slogans of "Tighten your belts, increase production, and develop foreign trade" are posted everywhere. Movies and radio broadcasts are all promoting "foreign trade." Most educated Britons understand that Britain is a country that started by relying on international trade. They would rather tighten their belts and save money to sell overseas. In fact, Britons now wear the coarsest woolen fabrics (no better than our Northwest woolen fabrics) and enjoy the simplest industrial products. Britons cannot eat eggs and enough butter, and even a vegetable or a rib is a delicacy on the menu in Britain. Some time ago, British newspapers unanimously attacked the Labour cabinet's food minister. Picketing several cinemas, they showed the food minister's photo, with various derogatory and "sarcastic" words next to it. At the same time, they also showed dozens of housewives complaining about not being able to buy oil, sugar, bread, vegetables, eggs, etc. Several newspapers pointed out that the lack of food in Britain was due to Britain's excessive supply to the German occupied territories. They questioned the government: "Why should we help our enemies and let ourselves go hungry?" As a result, Prime Minister Attlee met with Field Marshal Montgomery.</p>
<p>Explaining the truth of the facts. I also heard many "street speakers" in London's Hyde Park attacking the Labour government for the food panic.</p>
<p>The same is true of democratic countries, France and Britain are different, and the people of Britain and the United States are different. When the ship entered the port of New York after a monotonous ten-day journey, the American officers and soldiers on board all shouted and jumped. A small Red Cross tugboat filled with American flags sailed outside the port to welcome them. The small tugboat was full of American women, who waved to welcome their strong men back in triumph.</p>
<p>The Statue of Liberty still stands on the shores of New York. The "skyscrapers" of more than a hundred stories, whose roofs were once damaged by aircraft, have now been rebuilt with golden splendor. At the mouth of the Hudson River, large and small ships are like dense swarms of bees. The recently built USS Midway aircraft carrier, a 45,000-ton sea fortress, is also docked in the port.</p>
<p>Neon lights illuminate every street in New York. Thousands of vehicles and pedestrians cross Times Square. This "kingdom of gold" has not declined in the slightest after four years of war, but has become even more prosperous and flourishing than before. The wheels of the times have rolled over the Old World, creating a pinnacle for this young country in the New World. (Sent from New York on March 31st)</p>

<h3>The Supreme Procuratorate Concludes Investigation: Another Batch of Traitors Indicted; Chuan Shishuo to be Publicly Tried Today; Former Minister Yu Shaoying Sentenced to Fifteen Years</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Supreme Procuratorate concluded its investigation, and another batch of suspected traitors were indicted. These include Liu Yangshan, Xu Weizhen, Tang Liang, Ye Xuesong, Xu Xiqing, Chen Shaowei, Fei Gongxia, Sun Yunzhang, Shi Zhiming, Chang Dongming, Shi Jiangshi, and others, totaling eleven cases. Additionally, the suspected traitor case of Sha Yuanji and the internal disorder case of Wang Meimei were not prosecuted.</p>
<p>Yesterday, those whose investigations were prosecuted by the office included Wang Manyun, Sun Mingdong, Wu Binglin, Ling Jiacheng, Xue Qishou, Zhang Yipu, Gui Zhihai, Shang A'er, and others whose names I have.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Following the transfer of the major traitor Mai Jingming by military authorities, Chuan Shishuo will also be publicly tried at the Tilanqiao High Court at 2:30 PM today. Chuan once held positions such as a puppet minister and provincial governor, and was also one of the key figures in the puppet government at the time.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The father and son Yu Shaoying (puppet Ministry of Finance Treasury Director, puppet Central Reserve Bank Treasury Bureau Director, and supervisor of the bank) and Yu Zifan (puppet Central Reserve Bank Deposit Section Chief, and director of the bank's Wuhu office) were sentenced yesterday in their case of collaborating with the enemy. The main text: Yu Shaoying colluded with the enemy and plotted to rebel against his own country, sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for ten years. Yu Zifan colluded with the enemy and disrupted the financial system, sentenced to six years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for six years. All of the defendants' property, except for what is deemed necessary living expenses for the family, will be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Indictment of Chuan Shishuo</h3>
<p>The indictment of Chuan Jinshuo by the Supreme Procuratorate is as follows:</p>
<p>"Defendant Chuan Shishuo, male, age 56, native of Wenzhou. Formerly puppet Minister of Construction, residing at 41 Avenue Albert, currently in custody.</p>
<p>The aforementioned defendant, in connection with a suspected traitor case (Case No. 173 on Investigation, year 35), has been investigated by this prosecutor, who believes that a public prosecution should be initiated. The facts of the crime, evidence, and applicable laws are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Chuan Shishuo previously served in the education sector. In the 28th year of the Republic [1939], when the traitor Wang Jingwei came to the occupied territories to establish a puppet organization, Chuan Shishuo, as a former classmate of Zhou Fo-hai in Japan and a fellow townsman of Mei Siping, colluded with the puppet regime. In March of the following year, when the traitor Wang called for the 'National Government to return to the capital,' Chuan took the position of puppet Minister of Railways. In November of that year, he went to Japan to inspect railways for the purpose of collusion. On September 10th of the 30th year [1941], he was reassigned as the chairman (later renamed governor) of the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Government, concurrently serving as the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Security Commander, handling the 'cleansing' of the province, training county assistants, expanding the puppet security forces, cultivating power, and contributing funds to the puppet government in response to the Greater East Asia War promoted by the enemy and puppets. In October of the 33rd year [1944], he was transferred to be the puppet Minister of Construction, until the victory of the War of Resistance. He has now been transferred to this office for investigation by the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>The defendant has already confessed to the aforementioned facts in detail during the investigation, which is consistent with his statements at the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, and is supported by his handwritten confession. The facts of the crime are extremely clear. The defendant successively held key positions in the puppet central government and as head of the provincial government for more than five years. During his tenure as puppet Minister of Railways, he went to Japan to collude with the enemy under the guise of inspecting railways. During his tenure as the chairman and concurrent security commander of the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Government, he expanded the puppet security forces, handled the 'cleansing,' trained county assistants, and contributed funds, all of which were measures to resist the activities of our country's guerrilla forces and implement the puppet government's decrees. Furthermore, the Ministry of Construction, where he served, was responsible for important matters such as transportation and water conservancy. Therefore, it is undeniable that he colluded with the enemy and plotted to rebel against his own country.

<p>The 20th District (Yangshupu) District Office of this city convened a public speech meeting for the candidates for city councilor in the district at 2:30 PM yesterday in the auditorium of the Longchang Road Industrial Technical School. In addition to all of the Baojia leaders of the district, there were also over one thousand citizens who freely attended to listen, filling the seats. District Chief Ji Xia presided over the meeting and introduced the four candidates participating in the election: Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Lizu, Chen Zhijing, and Shi Chengfu. Pan had to leave early due to other matters, so he gave his speech first, lasting thirty minutes. He extolled local autonomy as the foundation for national construction, and that citizens should value the election of city councilors and be cautious in their decision-making. He also said that democracy grows gradually and cannot be achieved overnight, so as long as the people seriously exercise their political rights, democracy will surely be realized. Next, he stated that he believed that the three most important things that Shanghai should pay attention to at present are: (1) How to enable all citizens of the city to enjoy a life of peace and prosperity in a peaceful and stable environment. This not only requires the police to improve daily, but also requires citizens to build a sound Baojia organization and develop the ability to self-govern and self-defend. (2) How to mobilize the power of the whole city to eliminate illiteracy in the shortest possible time. Only with universal education can democratic politics have a sound foundation. Yangshupu is an industrial area, and the general workers and their children are deeply affected by the hardship of being uneducated due to the struggle for livelihood. Labor education and labor hygiene should be promoted with all our efforts, and the government should be assisted and urged to gradually implement them so that they can be promoted and effective. (3) How to make all citizens of the city commonly recognize the crisis that Chinese industry is currently encountering, and to sincerely promote labor-management coordination, so that this post-war city can not only restore its industrial and commercial status as the first port in China, but also make industrial products able to compete with foreign goods in the market. Therefore, the people should cooperate with the government and implement policies one by one in accordance with policies in order to take measures involving stabilizing prices and settling labor disputes, etc., to create a smooth environment for industrial production. We must know that only when industry is prosperous can commerce be developed, and all municipal administration will have the hope of rapid progress. Finally, Pan said that city councilors are representatives of the citizens, and no matter who is elected, they should be close to the citizens at any time and place, listen to the opinions of the citizens, carefully consider and integrate them, and contribute to the government, so that they can be said to be fulfilling their duties. Zhang Lizu is a descendant of Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong. After graduating from Fudan University, he inherited his ancestor's legacy and engaged in industry and charity. He especially devoted himself to the local undertakings of Nantong. In his speech yesterday, he also said that he was willing to learn from his ancestor's example and fulfill his responsibilities as a citizen in the local autonomy work of Shanghai. Chen Zhijing, the deputy district chief of the district, also stated his aspiration to participate in the election. However, Shi Chengfu, after reporting on his ambitions, declared that he would give up the election and hoped that the elders would elect the ideal representative in their minds. Finally, District Chief Ji made a concluding remark, encouraging all Baojia leaders to inform all voters in the district to vote with their conscience on the 28th for the candidates who have been announced.</p>

<h3>Movie Industry Treats Reporters, Reports Difficulty in Assigning Seats, Says All Movie Theaters May Close If Police Bureau Does Not Rescind Order</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's News] The Movie Industry Association of this city, regarding the City Police Bureau's order to close eight movie theaters, specifically treated reporters at the Kangle Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to report on the process. Chairman Liang Qitian presided over the meeting, and Standing Director Kuang Baoying reported and explained the difficulties of assigning seats; stating that in fact, implementing assigned seats would be very costly, and indeed not something that general movie theaters could afford. Implementing assigned seating requires hiring double the staff; a thousand seats would require at least fifteen ushers; each person's monthly salary would also need to be at least 130,000 to 140,000. At the same time, if tickets are printed with numbers and cannot be sold completely, there would be extreme waste every day; the cost of each ticket needs to be ten yuan, and the cost of several showings a day can be known. If seats are not assigned, tickets can be used continuously. In addition, armed people can enter the theater and arbitrarily choose seats; if seats are assigned, disputes will inevitably arise.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang continued to state several difficulties, saying that current ticket prices have already risen repeatedly; if the theater's expenses are not enough, it will inevitably increase prices again, which will not only increase the burden on the audience, but also affect the theater's business. After seats are assigned, audiences will inevitably arrive late; after the lights are turned off in the theater, people will continue to arrive one after another, inevitably obstructing the view of other viewers, and order may not be improved.</p>
<p>Li Di Yun, the Standing Director of the Association and manager of the Dahua Theater, said: the Police Bureau's orders have been obeyed repeatedly, and there has been no contempt; children under the age of twelve are not allowed to enter, and this has already been obeyed. It is generally considered that the order in public places in this city is best in movie theaters, and it is hoped that the authorities can help improve problems such as black market tickets outside the theater, as well as stalls and traffic. If the Police Bureau cannot rescind its order, all movie theaters may close, so it is hoped that all circles will uphold justice.</p>
<h3>Tianyun Tower Employees Petition</h3>

<h3>Sympathy Suicide: Woman Violently Stabbed, Man Fails to Kill Himself</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's News] The case of the woman surnamed Jin from Dinghai, Beijing West Road, Lane 1110, No. 17, being violently stabbed to death by her lover, Wu Shuying, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to the investigation, Wu comes from a scholarly family in Dinghai and graduated from St. John's University, but has no permanent property, so he has not yet married Jin. However, Wu and Jin have known each other for many years and their love is very deep. They finally felt that they would regret it for the rest of their lives, so they agreed to commit suicide together. The woman asked Wu to stab her to death with a knife first, and then commit suicide himself. Unexpectedly, when Wu raised the knife to stab, the woman cried out in extreme pain at the first stab, and said to Wu, "Kill me quickly, kill me quickly." So Wu stabbed her five times in the abdomen, neck, throat, and arms, etc., blood splattered everywhere, and she collapsed. Later, family members heard the sound and arrived, and Wu did not have time to commit suicide. The police rushed to the scene and took the suspect to the Jing'an Temple Sub-bureau for detention. The injured woman was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but to no avail, and she died shortly afterwards. According to Wu Shuying's confession, he admitted the crime and will be submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution according to law within one or two days after the investigation is completed.</p>

After traveling about a mile and a half, all twenty or so male and female passengers were left empty-handed, losing two gold rings, one gold watch, and more than one million in legal tender. The five thieves got off the bus and fled not far away. A passerby reported the incident to the Changqiao Outpost. An inspector led the police to pursue the robbers, who became anxious and came up with a clever plan. First, two thieves stopped the private cars of vendors Zhang Guan Gen and Zhang Youliang and sped away. Not long after, a carrier, Jin Miaogen (a local resident, 27 years old), arrived pushing a cart with 1.2 dou of rice. One thief also tried to rob his private car but failed, angering the thief, who pulled out a gun and fired a shot, hitting Jin in the back of the head, killing him instantly. The entire car was eventually robbed. Two remaining thieves, one escaped to Caohejing, where he was captured by the security team, and one fled to Shiyewan, where police officer Chen Shixiong arrived on patrol and gave chase. A scuffle ensued, and several shots were fired. Traffic police officer Lu Zhixiang bravely rushed forward and tackled the thief, and the thief was captured. When taken to the Sanhua Sub-bureau for interrogation, part of the stolen goods was found on his person. Afterwards, security teams from Caohejing, Longhua, and Meijialong and other places searched for the remaining thieves. As of dusk, they were still searching. It is reported that the deceased Jin Miaogen lived at No. 4 Wujia Lane and left behind a wife and a daughter.</p>
<h3>Major Petition by Provincial Civil Servants in Guangdong; Major and Minor Students in Guangzhou Suspend Classes for One Hour</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng Dispatched from Guangzhou via Airmail on the 19th of This Month from This Newspaper</p>
<p>As if a contagious cold, the recent strikes and class suspension trends in Guangzhou have been widely discussed. Petitions and euphemistically named "awaiting orders" incidents have occurred one after another, the most sensational being the major petition by civil servants. Particularly serious is the "requesting leave and awaiting orders" by the Guangzhou Provincial Women's Normal School and four other provincial schools in support.</p>
<p>It is inherently difficult to unite civil servants in an organized manner. However, in Guangdong, the source of the revolution, this unprecedented initiative has emerged nationwide.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, civil servants undoubtedly made significant contributions to the nation. Despite displacement and meager treatment, they endured hardships silently. However, after the victory, due to price fluctuations, they deeply felt that life had become even more difficult than before. Although the government repeatedly increased salaries and bonuses, they still couldn't keep up with the rapid rise in prices. Furthermore, the auditing office here has been strictly implementing the "Qualification Examination Connection Method" and the "Civil Servant Salary Restriction Method" since November of last year, without considering the actual local conditions. This resulted in a large portion of civil servants' salaries being deducted, exacerbating their suffering. Therefore, civil servants from the ten major provincial government departments, including civil affairs, finance, construction, and education, felt a need to take urgent action for self-preservation and initiated the establishment of the "Guangdong Provincial Civil Servants Welfare Advancement Association."</p>
<p>This is a purely civil servant organization. In early April, each agency sent a representative to prepare for its establishment. The work progressed rapidly, maturing by the 10th. On the 11th, they invited journalists to report on the principles and aims of the association. On the one hand, they planned to establish an employee consumer cooperative to assist the government in stabilizing prices and improving the welfare of civil servants in general. On the other hand, they openly attacked the auditing office, foreshadowing the questioning of the auditing office the next day.</p>
<p>Requests Explanation of Reasons</p>
<p>And Passes Twelve Proposals</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 12th, the congress formally established at the Chung Cheng Middle School auditorium. Over 1,500 civil servants participated. They immediately passed a motion to send two representatives to invite Director Li Yueyi of the auditing office to attend the meeting to explain the reasons for deducting civil servants' salaries. They also passed twelve proposals: (1) Establish the Provincial Civil Servants Welfare Advancement Association, including employee and family consumer cooperatives, social clubs, and libraries. The expenses, in addition to requesting the provincial government to allocate welfare funds, will be raised by the members. (2) Establish provincial-level civil servants' children's schools and reserve places in various public schools. (3) Request the provincial government to issue two sets of civil servant uniforms per person. (4) Request the provincial government to approve a loan of 100,000 yuan per person, to be repaid in five monthly installments. (5) Request the provincial government to forward to the Executive Yuan the handling of relief funds for civil servants returning to the capital, and to pursue the allocation of these funds. (6) Request the provincial government to request the relief sub-bureau to issue relief goods. (7) Request the provincial government to quickly negotiate with the Enemy Property Administration Bureau to allocate enemy and puppet properties as employee dormitories. (8) Request the provincial government to allocate rice and cloth at parity prices to reduce the burden on civil servants. (9) Petition the central government to postpone the implementation of strict civil servant qualification regulations in this province until next year. (10) Request the provincial government to pay civil servant salaries according to the salary scales of the Central Trust Bureau and various banks. (11) Request the provincial government to issue salaries on schedule, twice a month, on the 1st and 16th. (12) The auditing office should be held responsible for compensating the losses of provincial civil servants whose salaries are reduced.</p>
<p>Staff Flee, Leaving the Place Empty</p>
<p>Mistakenly Beat a Reporter</p>
<p>After two hours of discussion, the proposals were passed. However, Director Li was still nowhere to be seen. Public sentiment was filled with resentment, and they decided to march as a group to the auditing office to question Director Li. Listing eight reasons, over a thousand male and female civil servants formed a long line, holding large banners and two flags with the words "Questioning the Auditing Office," and set off mightily. Upon arriving at the auditing office, the procession stopped in front of the gate and sent representatives to the second floor to request an audience with Director Li. Reporters also entered to cover the event. The staff there stated that Director Li was out and that the secretary of the office would receive them. The representatives felt that the secretary could not represent the auditing office's views and reported this to the crowd. Upon hearing this, the crowd became agitated, shouting slogans and causing a commotion. Some civil servants, in their anger, rushed into the office, only to find it empty, with only one or two servants on guard. This further fueled the situation, and they destroyed the office equipment beyond recognition. The leaders were unable to stop them. Ironically, a reporter from a news agency was mistaken for an office employee and beaten up. After the truth was revealed, the representatives apologized to him. At the same time, the guards of the finance department stationed nearby mistakenly thought an accident had occurred and set up a machine gun inside the iron gate, aiming it at the crowd as a precaution. Later, the group, finding no progress, reassembled and went to the military headquarters and the provincial government to petition Director Zhang and Chairman Luo. The chief of staff of the military headquarters, Gan, received the presidium, expressed sympathy for the difficulties faced by civil servants today, and promised to forward the difficulties to the central government. The representatives also relayed the petitioning process to all the civil servants standing at the entrance. The civil servants' half-day of labor and appeals finally received a satisfactory response, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Director Issues Written Statement</p>
<p>Considers This Action a Regret</p>
<p>However, the auditing office, after the fact, not only requested the military police to send a team to protect it but also notified the local court prosecutor's office to send personnel to investigate the incident. It also invited Liu Houwu, the supervisory commissioner of Liangguang, to visit the office for inspection and to investigate who should be held responsible. Director Li also issued a written statement, stating that civil servants carrying machine guns and firearms formed a group and, without explanation, rushed into the office, destroying all the office equipment. Now, the office is unable to perform its duties, and he believes that this incident occurring during the victory of the War of Resistance and the establishment of the rule of law is deeply regrettable. Afterwards, the office suspended operations on the 13th and published an urgent notice in various newspapers, issuing a written statement, extensively discussing auditing regulations, stating that they could not help civil servants, and reported to the central government to handle the matter according to law.</p>
<p>Civil Servants Submit Defense</p>
<p>Claiming This Was a Legitimate Action</p>
<p>Upon seeing Director Li's written statement, the Civil Servants Welfare Association also issued a written defense, refuting Director Li's statement, claiming that this was a legitimate action. Civil servants were not rioters and did not carry machine guns or firearms. Only the guards at the entrance of the auditing office carried guns. As for the damage to the doors, windows, tables, and chairs on the ground floor of the auditing office, it was caused by the finance department's guards setting up machine guns, aiming directly at the civil servants, causing sudden panic among the civil servants, who dispersed into various streets. A portion of them hurriedly entered the auditing office. Although representatives of the association tried to calm them down, they could not stop them. In addition, they continuously visited Director Zhang of the military headquarters, Commissioner Liu, and Chairman Luo of the provincial government, and Minister of Auditing Lin Yun-gai (who returned to Chongqing on the 18th) to report and explain the establishment, purpose, and questioning of Li and to express sympathy and concern from the officials and to find a reasonable solution to the withholding of civil servant salaries.</p>
<p>Scholars Engage in a "Rebellion"</p>
<p>Quietly Awaiting a Reasonable Solution from the Central Government</p>
<p>As for what happened after this incident, in order to prevent the dispute from escalating, the authorities, under the mediation of Commissioner Liu and personnel dispatched by the military headquarters, conducted conciliation. Chairman Luo also expressed his views: (1) Investigate the facts and handle them impartially. (2) Compensate for the losses. (3) Absolutely guarantee the safety of auditing personnel. He also stated that the provincial government would seek a reasonable solution to the issue of civil servant salaries.</p>
<p>Therefore, both parties complied with the orders of their superiors, awaiting mediation. The auditing office also resumed operations on the 15th.</p>
<p>Since the opening of this scene of an all-out martial arts performance on the 12th, followed by a tit-for-tat battle of the pens, the newspapers have become battlefields, extremely lively. Now, everything has come to an end. The civil servants stated that if salaries could not be improved in the short term, they would petition again until a reasonable solution was reached, and welfare efforts would continue to be prepared. The auditing office stated that the dispute was awaiting resolution by the central government. The result was that the people were given a good show, and everyone said: "Even scholars are rebelling!"</p>
<p>Because the petition by civil servants was relatively novel, everyone's attention was focused there, and even the increasingly fierce trend of "requesting leave and awaiting orders" was overlooked. After the climax of the major petition by civil servants subsided, everyone's attention shifted back to this.</p>
<p>Zhongda Initiates a Trend</p>
<p>Various Schools Follow Suit with Requesting Leave and Awaiting Orders</p>
<p>The "requesting leave and awaiting orders," a disguised form of strike, was initiated by Zhongshan University. Because the price of rice in Guangzhou has been expensive for the past three months, and the meager loans were insufficient to maintain their livelihood, they implemented requesting leave and awaiting orders in order to obtain improvements, leading to widespread emulation.</p>
<p>The price of rice in Guangzhou has risen to 46,000 yuan per dan this month. The publicly funded students of the provincial normal schools and vocational schools only receive 4,000 yuan per month, which is not enough to cover their monthly food expenses. Although the principals of various schools had previously requested the education department to forward a request to the Ministry of Education for an increase, the education department agreed to forward the request to the Ministry of Education to increase it to 8,000 yuan. However, the exchange of official documents was time-consuming, and funds could not be received immediately. The students also waited quietly for the Ministry of Education's approval. However, on the 11th, Yao Baoyou, the director of the education department, went to the Provincial Women's Normal School to give a speech. All 600 students of the school jointly presented Director Yao with a request to increase the publicly funded amount to 15,000 yuan per month per student; otherwise, they would immediately "request leave and await orders." Director Yao stated that this matter required approval from the Ministry of Education but could only be increased to 8,000 yuan, and he advised the students to wait patiently. The students were not satisfied with Director Yao's reply and immediately suspended classes and held a general assembly to establish the Women's Normal School Students' Livelihood Improvement Request Committee, resolving to request the education department for: (1) improving their livelihood, (2) allowing them to postpone their service, (3) strengthening the school's sanitation facilities, (4) guaranteeing employment, and (5) improving the curriculum. Director Yao replied to each request and expressed sympathy, promising to help, and issued a notice stating that this matter could not be approved in one or two days and that the Ministry of Education had already approved an increase to 8,000 yuan, a portion of which had already been remitted, and that 8,000 yuan would be retroactively paid for February and March after being approved by the auditing office, advising the students to prioritize their studies and resume classes first. The students insisted that the matter would not be resolved, and they would still request leave and await orders, and on the 12th, they issued a notice to the public, calling for support and sending personnel to contact various relevant units and preparing to unite all publicly funded students in the city to jointly request improved treatment in order to maintain their studies.</p>
<p>Hold a Joint Petition</p>
<p>Hold a Meeting to Determine the Conditions for the Petition</p>
<p>Perhaps their living conditions were truly dire, and a single call received an enthusiastic response. The cultural community in the city also expressed sympathy, and the various normal schools, feeling a similar plight, expressed their determination to provide support. First, the Provincial Xiangqin Normal School provided assistance. Then, the Provincial Liberal Arts and Sciences, Law and Business Colleges, and the Guangzhou Vocational School, also deeply affected by the same suffering, the Liberal Arts and Sciences College immediately implemented "requesting leave and awaiting orders" to support the Women's Normal School and formed a joint association of five schools to jointly petition the authorities.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 16th, students from middle and upper schools throughout the city also suspended classes for one hour in support of the Women's Normal School.</p>
<p>On the 17th, the joint association of five schools held a meeting and decided to send representatives to petition Chairman Luo, with the petition content being: (1) Improve their livelihood, requesting that the actual amount of public funds issued be comparable to 2.3 dou of public grain, plus one-quarter of the basic living subsidy for provincial civil servants, and that it be issued monthly before the 5th. (2) Issue demobilization fees. (3) Improve the treatment of teachers and staff. (4) Guarantee employment for normal school students and vocational students. (5) Increase internship fees. (6) Increase sanitation facilities. If a satisfactory answer is not received, they will continue to request leave. In the afternoon of the same day, a reception was held for the cultural and news media. At the meeting, representatives of various schools issued heartfelt calls, describing their current dire living conditions and infinite hardships. Two schools have been forced to "request leave and await orders!" Their main problems are still the extreme hardship of living and the lack of guaranteed prospects. They said that some loans are always accumulated, and some could receive 2.3 dou of public grain per person during the war, but now the public grain has stopped, and they only receive 1,500 yuan per month in lieu of it. Although it has been increased to 4,000 yuan since January, they are still receiving 1,500 yuan, which is not enough to even eat congee. The school's living conditions, dormitories are not enough to allocate, some don't even have a bed, the lights don't work, the tap water doesn't work, the sanitation facilities are too poor... a series of hardships, how can one not shed tears of sympathy?</p>
<p>Director Issues Earnest Talk</p>
<p>Students Should Prioritize Their Studies</p>
<p>The local education authorities also tirelessly persuaded the normal school students to resume classes. Director Yao also issued a statement, answering their various requests one by one and seeking a reasonable solution, and sincerely guided the students to love themselves, love their country, and prioritize their studies.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Guangzhou Women's Normal School students, who had insisted on "requesting leave and awaiting orders" for seven days, resumed classes yesterday, the 18th, and will continue to make requests until a satisfactory result is obtained.</p>
<p>Professors Write a Letter to Fellow Students</p>
<p>The Words Are Earnest, Each Word a Tear</p>
<p>The Women's Normal School has resumed classes, but the Liberal Arts and Sciences College is still "requesting leave." In addition to requesting improved living conditions, they are also requesting to be reorganized into a university. Although the school officials have painstakingly advised them, it has had no results. Yesterday (the 18th), all 57 professors of the college jointly wrote a letter to fellow students, advising them to resume classes through proper channels, stating: "Requesting improved treatment and increased public loan amounts is inherently reasonable, but solving problems must follow proper channels. We, as colleagues, are heavily burdened and poorly paid, suffering from hunger and cold, which has long been known to the public, but we still teach tirelessly, not "requesting leave and awaiting orders," because we believe that academic culture is an essential element of social progress and that education is the lifeline of the nation, which cannot be interrupted for a moment. Furthermore, we cannot bear to let our beloved students, who are as close as family, fall into the plight of having no classes to attend, no way to study, and wasting their time. Now, requesting increased loans and proceeding with "university reorganization" have been put forward using the method of striking, without considering the sacrifices and impacts. We are deeply saddened. Finally, we encourage the students to prioritize their studies and cherish their time." The words are earnest, each word a tear.</p>
<p>As of now, the students of the Liberal Arts and Sciences College are still "requesting leave and awaiting orders," and two "hand grenades" were found at the entrance of the college president's office and the director of student affairs' office, wrapped in paper with the words "Danger" written on them in large characters. The reason why students have such weapons is naturally something to ponder. After this incident, the professors and people from the society heard about it, and all expressed indignation. As for how this matter will develop and whether the students of the college will continue to insist on striking, it is still unknown. But looking at the series of events that have occurred in the past ten days, they all symbolize the seriousness of social problems and the latent crises in the future of education. Of course, everyone understands the government's difficulties and cannot be overly demanding; but at least they can quickly find ways to provide relief and reasonable solutions in order to eliminate the continuous occurrence of events.

<h3>Yenching University Plans to Build</h3>
<p>A Science Laboratory</p>
<p>Nearly 5,000 US Dollars Raised</p>
<p>[United Press Honolulu, 24th] The total amount of donations received here for the initiative to build a well-equipped science laboratory at Yenching University in Beiping is approaching US$5,000.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Normal Students</h3>
<p>Appeal for Food</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou] The food expenses for normal school students and publicly supported vocational school students in Zhejiang Province have always been subsidized by the government, and since this semester, it has been determined to be 3,000 yuan per month. The Education Department believes that, given the current high prices, the originally determined amount is far from enough to cover the actual expenses. It has already telegraphed the central government to request a supplementary payment, but no reply has been received so far. Yesterday, the student associations of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou Commercial College, Hangzhou Normal College, Hangzhou Polytechnic College, and Sericulture School jointly presented a request to the provincial government, stating that food expenses cannot be interrupted for even one day and that most students are from poor families. If they are required to pay for their own food, they will truly be unable to afford it. They specifically requested the provincial government to quickly issue an additional payment and also planned to send a document titled "Appeal for Food for Normal School Students and Publicly Supported Vocational School Students" to all sectors of Hangzhou to request their sympathy.

<h3>Soviet Institute of Plant Cultivation</h3>
<p>Holds Scientific Conference</p>
<p>Discusses New Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>[TASS News Agency, Leningrad, 25th] The All-Union Institute of Plant Cultivation held a scientific conference to discuss how to expand the methods of collecting world crop specimens in the next five years and utilize them. The number of specimens totaled 150,000. Valuable agricultural knowledge and the scientific classification of crops are based on these collections. Many plants cultivated by the Plant Cultivation Institute's experimental stations occupy a large portion of the country's cultivated areas. In the case of wheat alone, the institute obtained 50 varieties based on its collection of world specimens. Under the new five-year plan, the collection of specimens will be greatly expanded. Several scientific expeditions will be sent to grain-producing areas throughout the country for this purpose. As a result of exchanges with foreign scientific research institutions, especially with the United States, Canada, France, Sweden, and Finland, the number of specimens will increase even further. On the one hand, a large supply of rice will be provided to domestic scientific and breeding institutions. This year, the breeding stations have obtained more than 50,000 wheat, barley, oat, pea, and buckwheat seedlings, as well as countless castor, vegetable, and other seeds. Works such as "The Soviet Cultivated Flora" and "The Biochemistry of Cultivated Plants" are about to be published.</p>

<h3>Teacher Appreciation Movement Charity Soccer Match: City Officials Appear Together; Heads of Party, Government, and Military Participate to Support; Full List of Sports Association Team Announced</h3>
<p>The Teacher Appreciation Movement Charity Soccer Match will be held at 3:30 PM this Saturday at Yiyuan, between the Sports Association Team and the Referee Team. The Shanghai Municipal Sports Association Soccer Team is composed of council members and staff of the association. All are former veterans who are now old and find running difficult, let alone showing technical skills. However, in order to respond to the Teacher Appreciation Movement and encourage the younger generation, even the elderly officials do not hesitate to try their best. This is also a new atmosphere in the sports world. The referees' team is accustomed to running. Facing each other, the strength is inevitably disparate, reducing interest. Therefore, the Sports Association team specially invited Xu Wenkui and Li Ning, the captains of the Qingbai and Donghua teams, to participate in the support to increase interest. The full team list is as follows:</p>
<p>[Captain] Qian Dajun, [Manager] Wang Weijun, [Goalkeeper] Shen Shihua. Zhou Jiaqi, Li Jilan, Shi Yushou, [Defenders] Li Ning, Xi Yushu, Feng Youzhen, Ma Qingyuan, Qian Dajun, E Sen, [Midfielders] Zhang Hanguang, Wu Kaixian, Zhou Jun, Xu Wenkui, Wu Shaoshu, Lv Entan, Cao Jun, Gu Yuxiu, Qu Xirong, [Forwards] Dai Jimin, Shao Rugan, Qian Xucang, Ling Xianyang, Cheng Yize, Wang Weijun, Li Chongshi, Yu Songyun, Le Xiurong, Xu Huanming, Li Ximou, Wu Zibin.</p>

<h3>Police Investigation Gradually Effective: Black Market for Securities Dwindles; Public Bonds Hover Around the 6,000 Mark; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Both See Tired Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, plainclothes police officers inspected the Securities Market, and speculators lost their courage at the sight of them. The spot debt market almost came to a standstill. Only after the situation stabilized did transactions occur, but they were sporadic and amounted to nothing. In general, the overall market initially broke through the 6,000 yuan mark under the pressure of suppliers at 6,250 yuan, seeing a low price of 5,900 yuan, and finally hovered around the 6,000 yuan mark. The results of the afternoon closing showed that Categories A, B, D, and E were slightly tired, and Category C fell back by 300 yuan. This was purely due to unfavorable objective circumstances, as buying and selling did not proceed smoothly and were hit hard. Most Chinese stocks were suspended. It was reported that two apprentices from a certain number on Central Road, holding stocks, were arrested by police patrol officers, which shocked other places even more. Each of the major counterparties sought ways to remedy the situation but remained temporarily cautious in the absence of appropriate solutions. Each stock transaction was a guerrilla-type transfer, gathered from various places, and was a disjointed, concealed price negotiation. Each stock was once tired due to the liquidation by holders. Finally, the call price slightly rebounded. Compared with the previous closing price, each hot and cold stock saw a tired decline. The so-called three little hot stocks in the stock market, Jing, Xinguang, and Qinxing, held shareholders' meetings at the same time yesterday, and resolved to change the capital from pseudo-Central Reserve Coupons to National Currency and pay interest of one cent. The situation of foreign stocks was even more secret. Open transactions were extremely rare. Except for the most popular Yisha, etc., which had some supply at the previous closing price, the rest were silent. Near noon, there were low absorbers, and the call price of each stock was slightly increased. As a result, all stocks were slightly lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Gold and Banknotes Both Show Declines</h3>
<p>The opening price of gold yesterday was still firm. Generally, people still had many concerns about the distribution price of 1.6 million by the Central Bank of China, which was not without impact. The buying interest shrank again, so it did not get rid of the hovering. The morning opened at 1.59 million, but the price of 1.60 million was difficult to break through. Soon, the US dollar turned around, and the gold market had a lot of outflow, once retreating to 1.57 million. After that, it rose slightly, and the fluctuation range was narrow. By noon, it was still around 1.575 million. The afternoon was slightly stable. As a result, it fell by 10,000 compared with the previous closing price, 168,000 for decorative gold, 1,600 for pattern silver, and 1,050 yuan for silver dollars. Secret discounts were slightly stable, and interest rates ranged from 12 cents to 15 cents.</p>
<p>The US dollar turned to show struggle. The demand and supply have been balanced. The morning opened at around 2,350 yuan. US business foreign firms slightly supplied. Buying interest was lazy, and it once fell back to 2,270 yuan. After that, it repeatedly advanced and retreated inside and outside 2,300 yuan. The afternoon trend turned stable, and a slight increase was seen. As a result, it fell back by 30 yuan compared with the previous closing price. Hong Kong tickets were stable at first, and Robbie turned loose, and then slightly tired. As a result, it fell back by 5 yuan compared with the previous closing price. The US exchange rate was still flat. 415 yuan for Hong Kong Telecom and 510 yuan for Robbie were traded.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Rise, Flour and Soybean Oil Follow Suit</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market rose by 1,000 yuan, with various producing areas being firm and expensive. Although there were no transactions in flour on the market, the outside stomach of the Chaozhou Guangdong gangs was still strong, and it continued to add 1,000 yuan. Shantou's digestion was more active, and it rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan again. Soybean cakes also rose by 200 to 300 yuan with Shantou's acquisitions. Road cargo added 400 to 500 yuan. Bran also continued to rise by 400 to 500 yuan, with Nanyang, Xiamen, and Shantou all having outlets. Yongbang Shantou slightly increased the selection of soybeans, and the price rose by 1,000 yuan. Medium and lower levels were flat, and the price of raw materials rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The situation improved and killed times. According to the rice market, yesterday, this city arrived in seven types of white japonica, etc., totaling more than 7,000 stones. The types and number of stones are as follows: 3,258 stones of white japonica, 315 stones of Du Xian, 100 stones of white yuan, 154 stones of early, 2,185 stones of early rice, 1,733 stones of thin, and 137 stones of Wu Xian.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Edible Oil to Arrive: Price-Controlled Distribution Implemented</h3>
<p>According to news from the grain industry in this city, recently, because the traffic between Shanghai and Qingdao has been smoother, a large amount of oil stored there will be transported in succession, which will be distributed by the vegetable oil factory and sold at parity retail to 500 stores of the designated oil sales number. Each store can be distributed one or two barrels per week, and each barrel is 350 city catties.</p>
<h3>Luxury Goods That Have Arrived: Allowed to Apply for Registration</h3>
<p>A batch of imported luxury goods that arrived in Shanghai before the end of March and were waiting to be unloaded, after being banned by the customs, the owners of this batch of goods requested accommodation from the Imported Goods Management Office. After being approved to apply for registration by the office, many people have been going to apply in recent days. Because the office has set the end of this month as the deadline for accepting this request, after further inquiring about the types of goods, it can be decided which materials will be temporarily accommodated for import.</p>
<h3>China's Economic Problems: Famine is the Most Important</h3>
<p>[Washington, 24th American News Service] According to the US Department of Commerce's Foreign Trade Office, China's most urgent economic problem is the famine. The lack of food is becoming increasingly serious, and several areas are threatened by famine. The lack of fuel is second only to the food problem. This year, due to abnormal dry weather, the possibility of locust plagues has already increased, so it is expected that this year's rice harvest will not greatly alleviate the food shortage. Not only that, but cholera and meningitis in southwestern China are quite rampant, threatening all residents in the area. According to the report of the Chinese Ministry of Food, Hunan Province has been the hardest hit. Other provinces and regions with serious disasters include Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, Hebei-Tianjin area, etc. The situation in other places may be equally urgent, but due to the lack of transportation and vehicles, it is impossible to conduct a thorough investigation. According to news from the northeastern provinces of Manchuria, the harvest of this important agricultural area last year was still satisfactory, and there will not be a widespread famine for a while. However, due to the difficulty of distribution, it may make the supply of several large consumer areas insufficient. According to the report of the US Consul General in Hankou, the food situation in Hankou can reflect the critical situation in Hunan and Hubei provinces. The rice transported from Hunan to the area has been cut off. Although there was a proposal to obtain assistance from Shaanxi and Sichuan in January, it was delayed.</p>
<h3>Cheap Cotton, Expensive Yarn: Yarn Mills Enjoy High Profits; Double Horses Once Rallied to 1.22 Million</h3>
<p>The textile industry in this city has recently seen rapid progress, the reasons being: (1) Cheap cotton and expensive yarn, manufacturers enjoy high profits, (2) A large number of US cotton imports, sufficient supply of fine yarn raw materials, (3) Taking over Japanese yarn mills and weaving as much as possible, (4) Many orders for US yarn spindles are placed with Shenchang Foreign Firm, but in reality, it still boils down to the superior profit of yarn manufacturing. Although the wages of textile workers have recently increased sharply, at least 3,500 yuan per person per day, and at most 6,000 yuan. One package of yarn costs 350,000 yuan in labor costs, plus more than four dan of raw cotton, about 350,000 yuan, totaling 700,000 yuan. However, the market price of 20-count cotton yarn is mostly outside 1 million yuan, so each package can still profit 300,000 to 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was exempt from ups and downs. In the early morning, the progress of 20-count Double Horses was too fast. It rallied to 1.22 million. As many bulls in the same industry made profits and sought to sell, it stepped down to 1.16 million. The closing price was the same as yesterday's price, but the small and medium-sized miscellaneous brands were not easy to fall back after being brought up, and they rose from 20,000 to 40,000 compared to yesterday. The Cantonese gang was quite searching for 32-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn. 20-count seemed to have no big stomach, so the price of fire-type yarn rose limitedly.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York US cotton telegraph reported an increase of 16 to 25 pounds of sound, with the near-term US dollar at 27.81, the long-term at 28.07, and the Meterling spot at 28.26. The spot cotton trade in this city was still good, and the market price became more and more firm. Meterling's delivery to the factory was as high as 82,000 yuan, and the transaction was about 1,000 packages.</p>
<h3>Silk Goods Over Demand: Silk Market Transactions Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday the silk market was flat. Artificial silk fluctuated only from 20,000 to 30,000 yuan throughout the day. The 120th Tianqiao opened at 1.53 million yuan, and closed at 1.51 million yuan, which was 10,000 yuan less than the day before. The factory's economic situation was quiet, and transactions were light. The call price was generally unchanged. Silk goods rose again yesterday, which was because silk factories had been shut down for a long time, and the inventory was short, and there was a phenomenon of over-demand. Each 100 US-Asian bed covers rose by 100,000 yuan again, and each code of Dachen Checkered Crepe was called over 4,000 yuan, and finally made 3,920 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Prices Still Have Not Improved: Foreign Firms Prepare for Activities</h3>
<p>The tired wind of the tea market has not ended. The stores on this street are still lazy to enter, and the Tianjin gang has also closed their stomach for a long time. At present, there are only scattered drags for Pouchong tea, and the prices are all lower than the previous market, and there is no improvement in transactions. As for the foreign firm tea market, it is still quiet and silent. However, it is heard that some foreign managers of British trading companies have set off for Shanghai successively, and the White Head Bank (i.e., Indian Bank) also intends to make a comeback for the Chinese tea trade.</p>
<h3>Asphalt is Depressed</h3>
<p>Asphalt has been gradually weak recently due to the sluggish sales market. Although there is no trend of large declines, it is depressed and it is not easy to turn around for a while, and most of the producing areas are blocked, and they all have low expectations. The sales plate in Shanghai has recently been slightly reduced, with Heben at 55,000 yuan, Inner Ping at 45,000 yuan, De Yu at 40,000 yuan, Lan Du at 38,000 yuan, Lan Oil at 35,000 yuan, and Macheng at 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Transactions Inferior</h3>
<p>The trend of the coal market is still not good. People are idle, and the number of new households continues to be cautious. There is still no improvement in transactions. In particular, all kinds of bituminous coal are the least asked for. Only white coal kids have slight retail sales, and the market atmosphere is always sluggish. The market is unchanged while resisting the support. In addition, the colleagues of the hand-cranked briquette factory in this city have applied to the Fuel Management Committee of the Shanghai District of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the allocation of Hongji coal seams, which has been approved, and they will handle the payment immediately.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Rise Step by Step</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market was still firm, especially the middle sand. In the morning, the association's division was initially flat and then tight, from 56,500 yuan to 57,250 yuan, and in the afternoon, it was the time for the auction again. A total of 2,000 packages of white middle sand, 56,000 yuan, rose by 5,000 yuan; 500 packages of white three and a half trucks, 64,000 yuan, rose by 3,000 yuan; 1,500 packages of raw sand, 52,000 yuan, rose by 4,000 yuan, all of which were opened as scheduled. The market opened 57,500 yuan to 58,000 yuan for white middle sand. There were differences in the bundled white, with an opening of 61,000 yuan. The calling price of green sugar was slightly higher, but goods of 47,000 to 8,000 yuan were also opened.</p>
<h3>UK Increases Production: Artificial Fibers</h3>
<p>[London, 25th British News Service] A reporter from the Daily Mail declared on the development of artificial fiber manufacturing in the UK that many factories in the central UK are currently receiving a large number of artificial fiber raw materials, which will be used for the sock industry. As for the mass production of artificial fiber fabrics and nylon stockings, it remains to be seen. Once the Nylon Textile Factory in South Wales is completed, nylon production will greatly increase, and small factories are also trying to obtain more nylon raw materials.</p>
<h3>Myanmar Promotes Rice Production: Government Decides to Provide Subsidies</h3>
<p>[Reuters Yangon 25th] The Government of Burma has decided to pay a subsidy of £90 or 1,200 rupees per hundred acres of fallow land to encourage rice production and help relieve famine around the world, so as to restore cultivation.</p>
<h3>London Chinese Bonds: Market Conditions Gradually Progress</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 25th] "Standard Evening News" stated that the business of Chinese securities worth £16 million on the London market, which was suspended in 1938-1939, has gradually improved, especially those guaranteed by customs and salt taxes. The newspaper pointed out that 14 of China's 40-odd ports before the war have now been reopened, with only two continuing to be closed and the remainder being inland river ports. At present, the scope of trade in these ports is very small, but it is believed here that China will soon resume its debt obligations.</p>
<h3>Chinese Furs on the American Market: Generally Feel Too Expensive</h3>
<p>[Reuters New York 25th] Chinese furs have now appeared in the fur departments of major stores across the United States. The criticisms from all parties are different. Some people think that the quality is excellent, and some people think that the leather is too hard or the color is not good. It is difficult to say what its future will be. It is generally thought that the price is too high, and it may be difficult to sell well. In a store in Philadelphia, Chinese mink coats are priced at US$1,495. The wholesale price of such leather coats is around US$900, so the retail price is between US$1,095 and US$1,200, and there will not be many buyers. However, leather-inlaid coats will generally still be popular this fall, and the popular furs will be Persian lamb, squirrel, leopard, lynx, sea otter, muskrat, raccoon, mink, silver fox, blue fox and mink.</p>

<h3>The Inevitable White Man</h3>
<p>— Original by Jack London, Translated by Lu Mang</p>
<p>"But what about Saxe Dorff? One night,</p>
<p>I was about to go to sleep when two "cats" began to sing in the courtyard. I wasn't in bed yet, but standing by the window, holding a water bottle. But just then, I heard the window of the neighboring room open. Two shots were fired, and the window closed again. I forgot to tell you how quickly it happened. At most, only ten seconds. The window opened, bang, bang, two shots, and the window closed. Whoever they were, he didn't stop to see the results of his shooting. He knew. You understand my meaning? -- He "knew it." There was no more chorus from the "cats," and the next morning, the two offenders lay there, quite dead. I found it incredible. I still find it incredible. First, it was starlight, and Saxe Dorff didn't aim before shooting; second, he shot so fast that the two shots sounded like one double-barreled shot; and finally, he knew he had hit his target without even looking.</p>
<p>'Two days later, he came to see me on the ship. At that time, I was the first mate on the Duchess, a very large 150-ton schooner, a ship transporting black slaves. Let me tell you, in those days, a ship transporting black slaves was just that, a ship transporting black slaves. There were no government officials on board, and there was no government protection for "us." It was a rough business, each taking what they could get, and if we ended up finished, there was nothing to be said. We transported black people from every South Sea island that didn't drive us off the shore. Sure enough, Saxe Dorff came aboard and said his name was John Saxe Dorff. He was a small man with sandy-colored hair, sandy-colored skin, and sandy-colored eyes. He had nothing remarkable about him. His soul was as moderate as the color of his appearance. He said he was broke and wanted to do some work on the ship. Willing to be a cabin boy, cook, cargo manager, or ordinary sailor. He knew nothing about anything, but said he was willing to learn. I didn't need him, but his shooting had made such a deep impression on me that I took him on as an ordinary sailor, with a wage of three pounds a month.</p>
<p>'He really was willing to learn, I can say that. But he was fundamentally incapable of learning anything. He couldn't recite the thirty-two points of the compass in order, just as I couldn't mix drinks like Roberts. As for steering, he made my hair turn gray in a hurry. I never dared to hand him the helm when we were sailing on the sea, and he was even more clueless about how to handle the sails. He could never tell the difference between a sail's yard rope and a sail's foot rope, just couldn't tell. The jib and the mizzen sail looked the same to him. Ask him to ease some mainsails, and before you knew it, he had dropped the after sails. He fell into the sea three times, and he couldn't swim. But he was always cheerful, never seasick, and he was the most willing person I had ever seen to do things. He was an unspeakable soul. Never talked about himself. His history, as far as we knew, began the day he signed on the Duchess. Where he learned to shoot, only the stars in the sky knew. He was a Northerner from America -- that's what we could tell from his accent. And that was all we knew about him.</p>
<p>And now we're going to start talking about the main point. We didn't have good luck in the New Hebrides, only managing to get fourteen indentured laborers in five weeks, so we headed for the Solomon Islands. Malaita, then as now, was a good place to load cargo, so we sailed into Marou, in the northwest corner. There were two docking areas there, one closer to the shore and one further out, and a very unstable anchorage; but we anchored well, and then fired a gunpowder cannon, a signal to notify the black people to come and be transported. After three days, we hadn't gotten a single laborer. Hundreds of black people paddled their canoes to our ship's side, but when we showed them beads and printed cloth and small axes, and told them how happy it was to work on the plantations in Samoa, they just laughed.</p>
<p>'On the fourth day, there was a change. Exactly fifty laborers came to sign contracts and were locked in the large cabin below deck -- they were allowed to come up to the deck to walk around, of course. Naturally, on careful thought, signing such a large number of contracts at once was suspicious, but at that time, we thought some powerful chief had lifted the ban on transporting black people. On the morning of the fifth day, our two rowboats went to the shore as usual -- one for cover and one for the workers. As usual, the fifty black people on the ship were on the deck, strolling, talking, smoking, and sleeping. Saxe Dorff and myself, plus four other sailors, were the entire number remaining on the ship. The two rowboats were guarded by Gilbert Islanders. In one were the captain, cargo manager, and laborer recruiter. In the other, was the second mate, which was the covering boat, which stayed about one hundred yards from the shore. Both rowboats were armed, though it didn't seem likely that there would be any disturbance. [To be continued]</p>
<h3>The Old Man</h3>
<p>— Yang Lian Yuan</p>
<p>He has lived in the small wooden house at the gate of this Western-style building for seventeen years.</p>
<p>Seventeen years, such a long period of time!</p>
<p>Seventeen years ago, the Chinese people's revolution was advancing to a new stage at that time. Some people were awakened: Are they still slaves? In the South and North, whirlwinds were sweeping.</p>
<p>Seventeen years ago, this old man moved from the wind-and-sand-covered Imperial City to this metropolis. Is it a move? Only he himself knows. He is an old man who guards the gate for others. Then, would it be more appropriate to replace "move" with "seeking food"?</p>
<p>"At that time, when I first came here, those foreigners were really impressive! Later, I gradually got used to it. I used a little bit of the method of serving princes and nobles to deal with them, and it was enough..." The old man coughed and choked, and his words stopped temporarily...</p>
<p>He continued: "Being a servant is a servant's fate! Sir, I have been here for seventeen years, but I have never been to the main street once. Sir, I heard that this city is more prosperous than Beijing! But I have only seen the Germans living in this Western-style building replaced by the French, and two years ago, the French left and were replaced by the Japanese. I only saw these. I guard the door for them, and they all paid me wages. Now, I am still guarding the door, guarding it for you, gentlemen!"</p>
<p>The coughing sound rang out again.</p>
<p>This Western-style building is also old, but the old man's small wooden house is even more dilapidated!</p>
<p>Near midnight, he opened the gate and let the last carriage carrying the masters who had had their fun drive in. Then he coughed and choked as he retreated into the small wooden house.</p>
<p>Five hours later, the sound of the train whistle coming from afar woke him up. The old man got up, slowly opened the gate, and slowly swept the path around the garden. For seventeen years, the old man had spent seventeen years like this, even though the masters had changed several times in between?</p>
<p>What about the days to come? The old gatekeeper himself doesn't know. Whether he lives or dies is irrelevant to the prosperous city.</p>
<h3>Presented to Wang Ziruo</h3>
<p>— Yang Qing Pan</p>
<p>In recent years, I have not known a time of peace. A song of Yunyang makes dreams clear. If Changmen had no resentment, there would be no need for esteemed wine to move emotions.</p>
<h3>Preface to Presented to Cai Jun Beilun</h3>
<p>— Jiang Wei Qiao</p>
<p>In the year of Gengwu, my friend Huang Renzhi introduced Cai Jun Beilun to me in a letter, saying, "Mr. Cai is a man of noble integrity, registered in Taiwan, but he does not forget his motherland. He abandons the wealth and honor of the barbarians and returns to starve on the seashore. Such a person is rarely seen in recent times." Beilun was extraordinary and upright, and his conversation was lively and humorous, so I became friends with him against the tide. Mr. Cai was originally from Quanzhou, Fujian. Since his great-grandfather traveled to Taiwan as an official during the Xianfeng period of the Qing Dynasty, his family settled there. During the Jiawu War, Taiwan was ceded to Japan. Beilun was twelve or thirteen years old, and he felt indignant and depressed, harboring the ambition to move inland, but he did not dare to do so without his parents' permission. He had no choice but to study in Japan, nurturing his ambition and waiting for the time to come. When his father died, he was again delayed by his elderly mother, so he served in the Taiwan Governor-General's Office and the Tokyo Ministry of Foreign Affairs. People thought that Beilun would become rich and powerful, but Beilun was saddened by his situation! After serving for more than four years, his old mother passed away. On her deathbed, she told him: "My son, you have humbled yourself for the sake of providing for me. Now you can carry out your ambition." Beilun recorded it with tears. After the mourning period, he immediately resigned and returned to his ancestral land with his family, naming his three sons Hanji, Hanwei, and Hanguang, to show that he did not forget the Han people. He first lived in West Lake, and then moved to Shanghai, not living in a fixed place, working as a teacher and a lawyer, only seeking to make a living without being picky about his profession. One year, there was an envoy of Kunyun on the sea who was good at physiognomy. His words were subtle and accurate, causing a sensation for a time. Many famous officials and magnates were close to him. In fact, it was Beilun, imitating Junping, relying on physiognomy to support himself. His efforts can be said to be painstaking. In the year of Dingchou, the Japanese invaders invaded our country, and the southeastern provinces fell. The enemy generals knew Beilun and repeatedly sent envoys to invite him to join them. Beilun avoided them as if they were dirt, and refused to be moved by the bait of important positions. Sometimes, when he could not avoid them, he politely declined them. After declining them, the invitations came again, and he firmly refused again. Friends worried about him, but Beilun did not care, saying, "If I die for righteousness, what regrets would I have?" When the enemy surrendered, he was overjoyed, saying, "I did not expect to see the resurgence of the Han people today. I will return south to pay homage to the graves of my ancestors!" I know Beilun deeply, and on his return, I write this to present to him.</p>
<h3>Birds of a Feather (30)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Li Yun had stopped crying at this time. Because from now on, she could be with Lihua every day. So, she happily went to find Lihua. Lihua was serving Master Hei in the study at this time. Li Yun told Lihua everything in a low voice. Lihua jumped up with joy.</p>
<p>Master Mo watched the two children's expressions and couldn't help asking them what was going on. The innocent Lihua told Master Mo everything excitedly again. She originally thought that Master Mo would be as happy as they were when he heard the news, but unexpectedly, Master Mo sighed deeply and said:</p>
<p>"A dream, a dream, another 'dream'!"</p>
<p>The children didn't understand Master Mo's meaning, but they could see that Master Mo was not only unhappy but also very sad. Only Master Mo understood in his heart that his illness came from this matter. Now, he was filled with emotions for this matter! He couldn't sort out his chaotic thoughts, and he seemed to have returned to that dream seven years ago. He seemed to be drowning in the mud!</p>
<p>Lihua and Li Yun looked at each other, dumbfounded and not knowing what to say, and didn't dare to say anything more, so everyone fell into silence.</p>
<p>"Yunmei! Yunmeimei!" Shiling shouted loudly. Then, he ran into the study like a whirlwind.</p>
<p>"Brother Bao, you're back so soon! Did you bring my bedding?"</p>
<p>"Yunmeimei, Uncle Weng is dead!" Bao Ling said breathlessly.</p>
<p>"What?" Master Mo suddenly sat up in shock.</p>
<p>Lihua and Li Yun were so scared that their eyes widened.</p>
<p>"Uncle Weng used a copper needle for smoking to pierce his belly button. He also drank all the remaining opium. When I went, he was already out of breath. There was a lot of blood on the bed. I was so scared that I didn't dare to stay for a moment and ran back in a hurry. So your bedding wasn't brought back either," Bao Ling said nervously, wiping the sweat from his face.</p>
<p>Li Yun was stunned when she heard this.</p>
<p>Lihua was so scared that she trembled.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Master Mo muttered to himself:</p>
<p>"Good! Now, the dream is over! It's over!" After saying that, Master Mo laughed out loud. "Haha..."</p>
<p>A boundless darkness enveloped him! He unconsciously coughed out a mouthful of thick phlegm, and then, as if he had drunk too much wine, he fell down in a daze; in a confused state; in a dizzy state</p>
<p>Bao Ling then realized in surprise that his words had caused trouble. Before he could regret it, he rushed to help Master Mo up.</p>
<p>"Dad! Dad! What's wrong with you? What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"Dad! Dad!" Lihua also called out in panic, shaking Master Mo.</p>
<p>"Yunmeimei! Go get water!"</p>
<p>Li Yun was also caught up in another new fear, and she had forgotten about her own affairs. She quickly poured a cup of tea and handed it to Bao Ling.</p>
<p>"Dad! Drink some water! Dad" Bao Ling held the tea to Master Mo's mouth.</p>
<p>However, Master Mo didn't open his mouth anymore! He only struggled to open his tired eyes, and softly shouted:</p>
<p>"Xiaohua"</p>
<p>"Dad!" Lihua responded, throwing herself into Master Mo's arms!</p>
<p>At this time, Master Mo moved slightly, then lay back peacefully on the bed, and just like that, as if drunk in a dream, he stopped thinking; stopped the flow of blood; stopped the breathing of his entire life; and from then on, he was truly silent and at rest</p>
<p>"Dad!" Bao Ling's voice changed!</p>
<p>"Dad!" Lihua cried!</p>
