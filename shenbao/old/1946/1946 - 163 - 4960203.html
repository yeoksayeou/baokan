<h3>大局發展仍待努力　恢復交通在洽商中</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕軍事三人會戰會前活動，今竟日尚在個別交換意見中。一說日內有舉行可能，又有關恢復交通之談判，馬使交通顧問平軍調部鐵道管理科長墨爾上校，十一日續與我交通部長兪大維及中共代表周恩來分別洽商，聞此項談判因雙方已提出具體意見，一俟會談成功，有迅派交通執行小組重往津浦，膠濟兩綫，督促復路之可能。據接近馬使者談，馬使甚望雙方對重開軍事三人會及交通商談之意見，迅能縮短距離，就目前局勢觀察，如中共能適時反省，不再故生枝節，能迅速派遣停戰執行小組及交通小組重赴靑，濟，泰，德工作，以撲滅此復燃之戰火，即有利和平談判。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十一日電〕今日據中央社瀋陽特派員訊：馬歇爾將軍不久將往長春一行，但此項消息未獲其他方面之確證。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕軍調部政府方面，為共軍在山東等地發動大規模攻勢，並連陷各地，已對中共方面提出抗議，並電各有關小組，以美方為中心，速調查具報。該報近來空氣頗不調和，開會時各走極端，或態度不好，不歡而散。中共之執行處長包士倫，四日前已離執行部返山東臨沂，據云：彼即為不適此種工作而離去之一人，彼之職務已由陳士渠兼代，共方參謀長羅瑞卿已數日不到軍調部，故各地軍事衝突頻發，而軍調部反現冷落。某負責人且稱：「這樣下去，十五天談判期滿，軍調部也就關門大吉」。凡此皆使人感覺前途之困難，惟政府方面派赴長春準備調處之軍調部長春分部工作人，仍將於明日派出委員辦公室主任唐公同，行營紐先銘亦準備前往。</p>

<h3>本月七日正午以後　共軍進攻及毀路眞相　國防部發言人昨日正式公布</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕國防部發言人，於十一日發表談話稱：和平統一建國，為政府一貫之主張，自本年一月十日政府頒布停止衝突，恢復交通命令後，國軍恪遵命令，切實奉行，而各地共產軍隊一面不遵調處，普遍發動攻勢，襲擊國軍，發展地盤，一面肆意宣傳，責難政府，圖卸責任。國軍開入東北恢復主權，不受任何限制，此為中共所同意簽定者，乃共軍初則乘機糾合部隊，佔領沿海各口岸及由海關一帶陸上交通，繼則要佔四平街，長春，哈爾濱及政府已派員接收之重要城鎭多處。國軍為恢復東北主權，曾排除一切困難與障礙，於收復四平街及長春各地後，不難直接北上，完成使命，然主席軫念東北同胞過去在敵偽鐵蹄下已受十四年之瘡痍，豈忍再羅戰禍，爰於本月六日正式宣布停止軍事行動命令，實再予中共一履行協定之機會，更為中共代表所同意者。共軍自本月七日以後之行動並未因停戰命令而稍戰，本部為使全國明瞭眞象，幷促共軍之猛醒起見，特將共軍自本月七日正午十二時以後攻擊國軍及破壞交通之事實，列述於後：東北方面：國軍遵奉主席蔣命令，自七日正午起，完全停止追擊前進及攻擊。詎共產軍竟不遵守信義，乘此機會利用鐵路，南明同時增兵，於東北停戰命令生效後三小時，分向國軍陣地發動猛烈攻勢，計（一）永吉東拉法國軍，七日晚被由岡敦鐵路竄來共產軍第一師及吉林軍區第七縱隊包圍猛攻，迄至十日，其兵力增至二十二個團，仍在激戰中，老爺嶺長凡三公里之隧道，被共軍破壞。（二）七日下午三時，共產軍由榆樹縣　五顆樹陶賴昭東南約二十公里間國軍猛攻，陶賴昭附近共產軍，同時向國軍襲擊。（三）農安西北三十公里法拉海附近共產軍第二十一旅，於七日下午三時起，向國軍猛攻，至八時共產軍增加千餘，繼續攻擊。（四）安東南之渭津河口鐵橋，八日晚被共產軍破壞。（五）八日晚共產軍由沙河子向海城東南吳城子及前後馬風山等地之國軍攻擊，至九日晚始被國軍擊退。國軍在以上各地，遭共產軍之攻擊，但為恪守命令，尊重信義，僅各於駐地採取自衛，未予還擊（未完待續）</p>
<h3>德州陷落泰安巷戰　濟外圍戰事蔓延　魯南共軍正向徐州推進</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕聞泰安已被共軍攻入，但激烈之巷戰，尚未停止，德州被共軍團攻四日後，守軍因衆寡懸殊，頗有傷亡，勢甚危急。據載送食糧藥品至泰安德州投鄭之航空駕駛員談，上述兩院城內外之人民，因中流彈及餓死者，倒斃街衢，歷歷可見，且見有甚多孩屍，為狀極慘。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江十一日電〕蘇北共軍刻因魯南戰事激烈，現已紛紛向魯南調動增援。又共軍在淮安車橋泗陽莊坊宿遷　頭邵店等處所設軍機處，及倉庫內　重，日夜紛紛往魯南搬運中。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十日電〕十日魯各地戰况仍烈。（一）膠濟綫：膠縣，藍村，城陽等曾被共軍攻陷，旋由國軍收復，周村情形不明，張店鎭亦失陷。（二）泰安國軍仍據城堅守，大汶口國軍祗佔一小據點，情形危殆。（三）德州十日午共軍飛機二架，在南關投彈二枚，機塲全毀。</p>

<h3>國軍恪遵停戰命令　盼共黨切實反省　中宣部彭部長發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕中宣部長彭學沛，十一日下午四時四十分曾單獨答復本報記者之詢問，（一）問，近日由馬歇爾特使居間有關停戰之商談，已否獲有結果？答，尚在繼續交換意見中。（二）問，軍事三人小組會是否有即刻舉行之可能？答，俟雙方意見接近後，隨時可以舉行。（三）問，政府目前對關內外各地共軍公然破壞停戰十五日之協定，究將採取若何對策？答，政府信守停戰諾言，國軍恪守停戰命令，此為舉世公認之事實，但政府不能見死不救，國軍亦不能放棄其維持治安，保衛人民之天職。如共軍犯擾地方，襲擊國軍，當地國軍為自衛起見，自當還擊，不過國軍僅以擊退來犯之共軍為己任，不事追擊。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕中宣部長彭學沛，於十二日招待記者會中，曾簡略致詞稱：蔣主席已經宣佈停止東北軍事行動十五天，讓共產黨方面拿出誠意，迅速解決停止衝突，恢復交通，整編統編的迫切問題。主席是十分盼望商議能得結果，以解人民於倒懸，希望新聞界同心協力，仰體主席委曲求全，力求和平的苦心，齊向此目標前進。凡不確實之消息和漫駡之言論，務須細心的，堅決的屛除，尤其與政府有關之報紙，希望特別注意，縱使共產黨方面有越軌之言論，亦須十分忍耐，不必報以惡聲。不過，事實之報道，宣傳部當然不能禁止，例如共軍八日猛攻德州，九日炸毀韓莊大橋，那是事實，在這雙方已下令停止軍事行動的期間，共軍竟在山東發動大規模攻勢，對和平談判當頭一棒，這是我們最感覺痛苦的。政府在這種情形之下，實在困難萬分，政府能够坐視不救嗎，這樣談判可以有結果嗎，希望共軍方面切實反省，不要東北停戰，山東開戰，使人民遭受犧牲，友邦感覺失望，這是我們誠懇盼望的。</p>

<h3>外輸准駛入內港原因　鼓勵出口減輕運費　彭學沛希望航商共濟艱危</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕中宣部長彭學沛，十一日下午招待記者時稱，最近政府特准外國輸船在漢口·九江·舊湖·南京四個港埠，裝卸直接進出口貨物，以一年為限，只准裝載直接輸出國外的出口貨，或者是直接由外國來的進口貨，不許裝卸在中國境內由甲埠到乙埠的貨物，這個辦法經過了鄭重的依法的程序通過了，已付實施。國內一部份航商，似乎對此有所疑慮，我想補充解　幾句。政府採取這種辦法的原因有二：（一）目前我國人民正在大量吸進進口貨，如飢如渴，旣然如此，更加要鼓勵出口，以稍資平衡，否則我國的經濟與幣制，將受極大威脅。但是我國內河船舶缺乏，由內河各港運到海口，頗感困難，內河運價的奇昂，便是船舶奇缺的證明。瑞典公使說從瑞典運到吳淞的運價，比吳淞運到上海外灘碼頭的運價還要低，這是事實。因爲駁船缺乏，上下全　人力，缺乏機械設備，所以上下轉駁一次，費用奇昂，這種費用，對於出口貨尤其是一個重要打擊。又有些出口貨的運輸，需要特殊的設備，例如從漢口輸去英國的鷄蛋，如須在上海換船，不但運費增加，而且損壞堪虞，照通融辦法，以增加運輸量，减少運費與損耗。（二）目前上海貨物擁擠，倉庫空位極為難覓，船舶到埠，常常找不到碼頭位置，甚至繫船的浮筒亦不够用，外來船舶，常常停靠吳淞口外，等候空位達數星期之久，如有些船能逕駛內港，亦可减少此等　滯。這個辦法是復員時期的應急辦法，只限一年內有效，政府對於本國航業，保護鼓勵，不遺餘力，無時不在念慮之中，航業界諸君，務請放心，政府爲救濟目前緊急局面，不能不權衡輕重，急則治標，希望大家體念時艱，共濟艱危。</p>
<h3>法放棄在華特權條約　暨中越關係協定換文</h3>
<p>第五條　（一）爲免除關於法國公司或人民，或法蘭西共和國政府，在中華民國領土內，現有不動產之權利及契據，發生任何問題，尤為免除各條約及協定之各條款，因本約第二條規定廢止，而可能發生之問題起見，締約雙方同意，上述現有之權利及契據，不得取消作廢，並不得以任何理由，加以追究，似依照正常法律程序，提出證據，證明此項權利及契據，係以詐欺或其他不正當手段所取得者，不在此限，同時互相了解此項權利或契據，如其取得時，所根據之原來手續，日後有任何變更之處，不得因之作廢，雙方並同意此項權利或契據之行使，應受中華民國關於征收捐稅有關國防及征用土地各項法令之約束，非經中華民國國民政府之明白許可，上述任何權利或契據，並不得移轉於任何第三國政府人民或公司。（二）締約雙方，並同意中華民國國民政府對於法蘭西共和國政府，公司或人民，現有之不動產或租契，或一切其他證件，如欲另行換發新所有權歌時，中國官應當不征收任何費用，此新所有權，應充分保障上述租契，或其他證件之持有人，及其合法繼承人或受　人，並不得減損其原來權益，包括轉讓槿在內。（三）締約雙方並同意，中國官廳得向不法蘭西共和國政府，公司及人民，要求繳納涉及在本約發生效力以前之土地移轉之任何費用。</p>
<p>第六條　（一）法蘭西共和國政府，對於中華民國人民在法　西共和國一切領土內，早已予以旅行，居位及經商之權利，中華民國國民政府同意、對於法國人民、　中華民國一切領土內，予以相　之權利。（二）締約雙方在各該方　領土內，盡力給予對方之人民　公司，關於各項法律手續興司　事件之處理，以及有關稅捐之　收，不低於所給予不國人民及公司之待遇。</p>
<p>第七條。締約此方之領事官，經彼方給予執行職務證書後，得在彼方領土內，雙方所同意之口岸地方，與城市，駐紥締約雙方之領事官，在其領事區內，應有與其本國人民通訊，會晤，指示之權、其本國人民亦隨時有與被等通訊之權。遇有締約此方之任何人民，被地方官　　捕或拘留時，該地方主管官　，應立卽通知在該地方領事區內之彼方領事官，該領事官在其　管範圍以內，有興其任何被逮捕或在獄候審之本國人民接洽之權。締約此方之人民，在彼方領土內被監禁者，其與本國領事官之一切通訊，地方官應應予轉遞，締約此方之領事官，在彼方領土內，應享有現代國際慣例所給予此等官階人員之一切特權及豁免。（未完）</p>

<h3>社論　從「西歐集團」說起</h3>
<p>最近法義兩國舉行總選，天主敎政黨大獲勝利。法國普選結果，以外長皮杜爾爲領袖之人民共和行動黨，即進步天主敎黨，在新制憲會議中，占絕對優勢，一躍而爲當前法國第一政黨，同時，共產黨之聲勢則銳减，已不能控制換縱法國政局。在義大利，亦復如此。荷蘭普選，天主敎黨亦成爲該國之第一政黨。凡此跡象，遂使若干人士認爲西歐大陸似將成爲傾向保守勢力者之天下。除西班牙及葡萄牙係由天主敎極權政權所統治外，其餘悉爲民主緩進右翼天主敎黨之勢力。倫敦政治觀察家曾謂：著名之「西歐集團」，似已逐漸成爲事實，惟其中心不在社會主義之英國而在梵蒂岡而已。連同法義在內，天主教政黨之勢力圈將包括荷蘭，比利時，盧森堡，奧地利，及德國南部一帶。這實是値得世人注意的一種趨勢。</p>
<p>這次天主教政黨在法義以及西歐各國之抬頭，在另一面所表示的，大概是共產黨的失去同情。經過了戰爭的長期苦難，共產黨原欲利用時機，奪取政權，然而人民的意向，郤斷然加以拒絕，民主畢竟戰勝了獨裁。此次法義兩國的選舉所給我們的指示，就是在一個民主國家裏，人民明顯地拒絕了共產黨，可見民主與共產究竟有些分別。只要眞正民主，共產黨的獨裁專政辦法便會站不住，而任何人也不能假借民主的美名，爲共黨聲援的。共產黨一貫的作風是虛張聲勢，以少數來控制多數，奪取政權。法義兩國在德國敗降以後，共黨聲勢，初不可謂不盛，然而人民的意志畢竟是小能欺騙的；兩國的共黨終於爲人民所厭棄了。中國刻方走上民主的路綫，民意尙無具體表現的方法，然而人民的、一般觀感，對共產黨可以說都懷戒心。鑒於法義共產黨的失敗，我們以爲中國現在鬧不淸楚的黨派糾紛，只要政府開明一些，眞正實行民主政治，讓中國老百姓無拘無束的投票，一定可以得到和平的解決，共產黨也不必夢想在中國來散播共產主義的種子。</p>
<p>法國自革命以來，在過去一百五十餘年間，其間政潮起伏，然而彼此都有一個共同持徵，這就是反對天主敎會。自第三共和國以後，反敎之風益熾，天主敎會在法國之存在，頻頻遭受一般政客之抨擊，國家且復頒制法令，限制敎會活動。凡此種種，原有歷史的及思想的背景。一百餘年來，歐洲受着法蘭西革命期思想的桎梏，而其結果郤使歐洲產生橫暴的集權主義，法國本身遭受到這種橫暴的集權主義的摧殘。如今希特勒主義是擊潰了，另一集權主義郤又企圖施展橫暴。人民今日所需要的是安定而不是新的嘗試，他們從法蘭西革命期的幼稚思想中解放出來，恢復了他們固有的光榮傳統，而發揮了他們的力量。這就是天主教政黨的抬頭和得勢。而且値得注意的是這種趨勢遍及整個西歐，初不以法國爲限。由於這種趨勢，使我們感覺到當前我國的政局實不應長此拖延下去。中國人民有和平的天性，有中庸的傳統，實在與共產黨的本質和作風不相合，他們也未必眞能代表人民的意向。如今盛行在西歐的天主敎政黨的理想，多少與中國的中和理想相近，而三民主義就是政治上中和理想的結晶。今夭我們所要求的，就是國民黨能掙一口氣，認眞實行三民主義。</p>
<p>天主敎政黨在西歐的抬頭，表示西歐人民的一種新覺醒。他們感覺到自宗敎改革以來所引起的混亂，使歐洲增加其紛擾與苦難。惟有使政治宗敎化，使實際政治能實踐宗敎的理想，緩能使社會秩序乃至國際秩序趨於安定。這是一種値得我們注意的趨勢。至於若干觀察家所謂，著名之「西歐集團」似已逐漸成爲事實，而以梵蒂岡爲中心，則未免言之過火。梵蒂岡爲天主敎宗之所居，它本身並不參加直接政治，純是一種超政治的宗教組織。天主敎信徒以敎宗爲精神領袖則有之，以梵蒂岡爲「西歐集團」的中心，則顯爲事實。前幾天，蔡寗主敎在中國就曾說明過，梵蒂岡的教皇並不用威力來脅迫天主敎徒反對共產黨的，我們也相信，西歐若千國家人民减少對於共產黨的信心是一回事，而天主敎的宗敎組織乃是另一回事。梵蒂岡是超政治超國家而存在着的，與西歐集團的形成並無關聯。</p>

<h3>四國外長重行集會期近　貝爾納斯今飛巴黎　昨對記者說明此次會議之重要性　謂若無成就將為整個人類之失敗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十一日廣播：美國務卿貝爾納斯明日飛赴巴黎，參加外長會議，今日舉行離美前最後一次之記者招待會。據稱：此次外長會議再度舉行，若再失敗，則將成為整個人類及四强之失敗。貝氏並謂：自上次外長會議延期以還，各方對於問題之解決，迄未獲得任何成就。</p>
<p>貝氏並稱：渠對會議前途並不悲觀，惟抱虔誠之心理祝禱會議成功。各國人民不應相互角逐，視會議如足球賽，以一國或另一國之外交勝利衡量會議之任何進展。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯本星期內又要往巴黎去參加四國外長會議，戰後的世界空間衹是一個，或將分成兩個，可能在這次會議中水落石出。貝爾納斯為了完成歐洲的和平，曾為他自己定下一個期限，他已決定在本年年底之前，無論如何與義大利和東歐的國家訂立條約。他認為要想使世界恢復元氣，這是必不可少的一着。為了達到這個目的，貝氏似乎已準備勇往直前，必要時，甚或不必與蘇聯合作。</p>
<p>英外相貝文，蘇外長莫洛托夫，法外長皮杜爾和美國務卿貝爾納斯的代表們已經在巴黎不斷進行，但是議會據此間外交界的消息，他們對任何重要問題的解決，都沒有獲得進展。</p>
<p>據外交當局鄭重的聲明：此外巴黎外長會議將有兩個重要的道路可走，但不知走那一條？其一，就是各强國共同合作，其二，就是僅英美兩國合作，蘇聯則加緊控制她的勢力範圍，法國因為國內共產黨勢力雄厚，也成了一塊不易應付的土地。換句話說，巴黎外長會議如果失敗，則蘇聯與西方强國間的鴻溝將愈益加深。</p>
<p>關於原子能問題，據說美國已經預備作具體的提議，設立國際性的原子能發展機構，所有世界上產生原子能原料的地方將都由他來統制。依照這個辦法，國際間旣各穫得保障，那麼所有的國家，包括美國在內將逐漸把他們所有的原子能情報和秘密一一公開宣布。</p>

<h3>擴展日漁區蘇表示反對　對日管制會將有激辯</h3>
<p>〔合衆社會東京十一日電〕靈通方面今日稱：對日管制委會明日舉行會議時，美蘇兩國或將在擴展日本漁航區域一問題上，發生熾烈之衝突。現有跡象，顯示麥帥意欲請求委會，對渠所提擴大日本漁船現有航區之建議，加以考慮。美代表艾其森基於日本糧荒嚴重，需多覓水產食物為理由，擬動議將新限制區擴大。但據合衆社獲悉，蘇代表特萊夫揚柯似將反對任何擴展漁區之動議。據若干美方官員謂，蘇聯表示反對之藉口，為擴大日漁船之航行自由，意或在於放任日人向北進入蘇聯之捕魚區範圍以內云。</p>

<p>〔中央社羅馬十一日合衆電〕義王安伯托在昨夜典禮中，拒絕以國家元首之權力移交總理加斯貝利，此乃義國由君主制轉變為共和制時出乎意料之頓挫，蓋預料此次典禮，僅為形式也，義內閣當即召開緊急會議，以考慮義王在報吿複決票數，加以阻撓之情勢，加斯貝利曾至皇宮晋見義王，要求由最高法院正式宣佈投票結果。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十一日廣播：英外相今日致電義總理，謂義國此次國民複決之進行，極為合法，英國對義之立塲不變。</p>

<h3>新式戰爭愈出愈奇　利用原子射綫　可以滅絕生育　供和平用途則能興雲佈雨</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十日電〕法國物理學家郁利奧，為科學家中最先發現鈾原子可產生循環反應者之一，原子彈，原子能與輻射綫之產生，皆由此項發見而來。郁氏近在芝加哥原子科學家公報揭載一文，並在倫敦發表談話，預測一種新式核子戰爭，利用目不能見之原子射綫，秘密異常，人類將無從知其發動戰爭。據郁氏宣稱：「將來一個擁有原子炸彈百枚之國家，自以為有備無患，一旦忽受統計專家之警吿曰：五年以來，中區孕婦流產者其數激增，六人中竟無一正常分娩者，沿海各港，火災燒毀收成，北部亢旱，使全國失去電能達四分之一。於是政府及議會將澈查此項數字，結果祇有一個說明，即於數年以來，有人在暗中向之作戰，因此遭受絕大破壞，與無數犧牲，而竟無一人覺察戰事已於何時爆發。」郁氏所稱絕滅生育之法，可由敵方間諜人員秘密發出放射性原子材料之X光綫所致。惟此外尚可使人類遭受其他傷害，郁氏則並未提及，亦未說明國人何以不能認識此種徵象，郁氏未言火災如何發生，氣候如何被操縱，但稱：一旦能以原子彈供和平用途必可利用以改變大部份之地面，或於廣大之區域內興雲佈雨。即在今日，我人已知將來當可改變地形與氣候，新放射元素將使化學變化在極高溫度中進行。其他外國科學家亦曾預言氣候可以節制。惟美國科學家對於鈾，鎭，鋁三元素產生之能，並未作何預言，此三種金屬為目前產生原子能之重要元素。</p>

<h3>阿族政治精神領袖　赫賽尼自巴黎出走　英向法提交涉認此事為對英不友好舉動　恐猛虎出柙影響中東局勢</h3>
<p>〔路透社耶魯撤冷十日電〕耶魯撒冷舊城內之居民，咸信回教大主教赫賽尼，即巴勒斯坦阿拉伯族之政治兼精神領袖，已在來此途中，舊城街頭上，滿懸阿拉伯國旗及主教之肖像。按赫賽尼與一九四一年伊拉克之反英大暴動有關。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕耶魯撒冷回教大主教赫賽尼自巴黎失蹤後，行蹤至今不明。已抵大馬色之說，業已證明為不確。其姻弟阿拉伯高級委會主席赫西尼，現在距大馬色四十哩處之勃魯丹參加阿拉伯聯盟理事會議。聯盟理事會曾於四月六日函法政府，謝其保護赫塞尼。赫賽尼</p>
<p>原在德國</p>
<p>納粹崩潰後，即自投法當局。本社巴黎特派員稱，赫賽尼失蹤之訊，其令人注意，不亞於下屆法總統及總理究將誰屬之問題。法外部繼續表示不知及驚奇之態度，其他當局若警局及內政部等，亦均力持緘默。謠傳赫賽尼之出走，曾得英政府之臂助，「世界日報」謂赫賽尼出走成功，係因巴黎或倫敦並無眞正阻其出走之意。然據消息靈通之外交界人士稱，法外部之茫然無知，似屬實情，然內幕究竟如何，亦非局外人所得而知。乘飛機自法國出走，並非易事，警察及頒發護照當局豈能一無所知。惟若干盟國飛機。包括</p>
<p>蘇聯飛機</p>
<p>則享有外交特權，時在巴黎附近這飛機塲昇降，赫賽尼在法國時，曾不時與其中東朋友接觸，埃及及叙利亞公使館乃其常至之處。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕英外部訓令駐法大使館向法政府要求解釋耶魯撒冷大主教赫賽尼失蹤之事，英政府認為法政府必係知情，故不失為對於英國「不友好之舉動」英外交界指稱，法政府深知英政府對赫賽尼所抱之態度，英政府甫於數星期前，通知法方，吿以赫賽尼若返中東，將不失為「不歡迎而又危險」之舉。蓋赫賽尼一旦返中東，或將再如一九三六年之組織阿剌伯軍。</p>
<p>反抗英國</p>
<p>英政府不信赫賽尼得絕無官方准許，或未與若干法國最高級官吏同謀卽能離開法境。且渠在名義上雖受法國警察監視，而實際上仍得隨意與阿剌伯政界人士自由接觸。接近英外交部之人士坦白表示，由於巴勒斯坦現局正在微妙狀態之下，赫賽尼之返抵中東，將使局勢益趨複雜。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十日電〕法國負責管理外僑之某高級警官，衆料當已因耶路撒冷回教大主教失踪一事，而受免職處分。該回教大主教或係偽飾為阿剌伯代表團團員之一而混出法境。渠最近曾患病，或係佯為有病，亦未可知，俾得因此便於化裝也。</p>

<p>外間推測故暹羅王馬希道，並非因偶然的事致死，據近暹羅方面的人仕對此表示懷疑。雖然除公報以外，他們未曾獲得任何情報，但暹羅人士深信，並未有某種國外或暹羅份子企圖殺害故暹羅王馬希道，以奪取王位，因為他的幼弟新暹羅王完全贊同他的政策。</p>
<p>該方面人士稱：故暹羅王馬希道曾患有腺病，致使他的身長超過了六尺—這種高度，在暹羅人中並不多見。</p>
<p>故暹羅王的遺體將置放於金甕中，舉行一小時半的葬儀，並不斷鳴放禮炮。其遺體在火葬前將予以盛裝，安置於王宮的達西蒂甕中，供國人參拜。暹羅王之死，對於暹人仍舊是一個謎。官方解釋說：暹羅王是因玩弄美國手槍不愼偶然致死，若干方面並不接受這種說法，他們對於暹羅王前曾患病之聲明，則表示接受，因為他未能出席上星期六舉行的攝政團主席火葬儀式。</p>

<h3>程監察使列舉事實　糾舉糧貸舞弊　證明官商勾結　楊錫志等貪凟罪嫌重大</h3>
<p>舉市矚目之糧貸舞弊案，經江蘇區監察使程中行嚴密澈查，已證明糧政處確有官商勾結舞弊之嫌，並列舉事實十項，呈准監察院提出糾察。江蘇監察使署頃公布致行政院糾舉糧政處特派員楊錫志，專員兼代理處務汪達人，調節科長任星崖，田糧署長兼東南區特派員長江區糧食儲運委會主席李崇年，違法失職，並犯貪汚凟職重大嫌疑之公函全文如后：</p>
<p>為糧食部上海市糧政特派員楊錫志·糧食部專員兼特派員辦公處秘書代理處務汪達人·調節科科長任星崖·曁糧食部田糧署署長兼東南區特派員長江區糧食儲運委員會主任委員李崇年·違法失職，提出糾舉事：查上月滬市糧價狂漲，數日之間，食米飛躍逾三萬餘元，中外側目，民怨沸騰，直接貽害民生，間接毀墮政府威信。本署飭派科長曁調查員多人，分向糧政特派員辦公處，豆米菐公會，以及承貸糧款之公司行號，澈查眞相，綜核報吿，一般奸商之囤積居奇，固為糧市波動原因之一，而糧政處辦理糧貸，跡象詭秘，違失之處，不一而足，實為造成此次糧食風潮之重大原因。夫奸商之惡，顯而易著，貪黷之罪，隱而難見，數年以來，奸商橫行，扶持助長者，實為貪官汚吏。欲謀剷除奸商，必先消滅貪官汚吏，刑亂國用重典，必懲一以儆百。茲分別撮其調查要點如左：</p>
<p>十項要點</p>
<p>（一）查貸款總額九億四千萬元，除復康米行承貸四千萬元外，其餘萬昌等十五家，各貸六千萬元。凡有運銷米糧能力之行商，雖非豆米業公會會員，亦得申請貸款，規定限制過寬，實啟官商作奸之門。參證辦理貸款之經過，其為各種弊源，預留地步，似覺信而有徽。（二）查滬市米行同業，計有三百餘家，米號業一千八百餘家，其中不乏資本殷實，歷史悠久之行號。而糧政處核准承貸糧款之十六家，其資本數額，多半在四五百萬元，甚至如新昌·協昌泰兩家，資本僅百萬元左右，永順泰以五十萬元資本，承貸六千萬元之鉅額，復康係新開米行，察其內容，頗似臨時組織。糧政處不加審察，竟予核准，旣屬違背審核小組會第一次會議之決議，復有勾結營私之重大罪嫌。（三）查萬昌新與萬昌為同一店主萬墨林所開，成豐米行主人邢志剛，借萬昌新牌號，出面頂替，承貸糧款，殊非正當商人所應為。志豐號平素專營雜糧，有無運銷米糧能力殊難斷定。至江北公司原以江北土產之購運加工出口，及江北農林畜牧工曠諸企業為營業範圍，其於糧貸申請書中，雖塡寫有糧食部之設置，然從未採購運銷米糧，旣非豆米行業公會會員，其有無運銷米糧之能力，亦頗滋疑問。核與貸款辦法第二條規定顯有不符。（四）查承貸各商，由糧政處指定豆米行業理事及雜糧業整理委員所經營之萬昌等八家，交由商會提出，豆米業公會理事長萬墨林介紹志豐，協昌泰，會豐，恒泰豐四家。糧食部由糧署署長，兼長江區糧食儲運會主任委員李崇年介紹長江，江北，通益三公司，交由萬墨林提出。復康米行則由糧政處與該行經理邵李高暗中商定，交托萬墨林提出，顯有官商勾結，意圖漁利嫌疑。表面上雖經審核小組會通過，而提交審查之糧量，申請者計十六家，被核准者亦十六家，申請糧商並未有加倍或多餘數額中，俾審查者得有嚴格選擇與取舍之餘地。且當審核之時，申請商號與審核委員同坐一堂，更使審核委員不能自由發揮意旨。據調查所得，十六家申請糧貸之商號，多半由糧政處</p>
<p>預先接洽佈置</p>
<p>輾轉由公會或商會出面提出，審核僅具形式，操縱勾結之情態至為明顯。主持會議之糧政處代理處務汪達人，及調節科科長任星崖，實應負重大之責任。（五）查糧貸商採購地區，多數在無錫，蘇州，常熟，崑山，靑浦，松江一帶，各該地密邇滬市，自聞糧貸消息，先將米價抬高，嗣因外來大量採購，各地米價遂逐日猛漲，設立糧貸，原為充裕滬市民食，（糧商貸款辦法第一條），但其實行之結果，滬市民食，竟因糧政處之辦理不善而倍增困苦。上海隣邑之民食，亦同受高價之禍。糧政處對於採購地區，事前旣未審愼考慮，事後亦漫不經心，任商民之自由採購，一任上海鄰邑之民食發生突異之變化。上海之民食，固須充裕，上海以外之民食，豈應坐視不願。卒使滬市與其鄰邑米價，同時高漲，此糧貸設置之原則，旣未審思，而其辦理之際，更</p>
<p>包藏私心</p>
<p>糧政處主管各人，均應負疎失及營私之咎。（六）查長江公司向楓涇，松江，南京等地採購之米，早在四月二十四及五月四日到滬，而開始銷售日期，則在五月十五日，米糧到滬十天，不以之銷散市塲，即該公司現存之糧，尚有九百五十六石三斗，又九百五十包，其中一部分，為五月二十日以後到滬之糙米，該公司於該項糙米運到後，遲遲不予加工出售，用意何在，殊難索解，此其一。各糧商購運到滬之米，售價紛歧，衆　盡依審核會決議，按照隔日收盤行市貶價二千元之規定辦理，此其二。各糧商領到貸款後，有若干行號如長江公司，協昌泰，會豐等，並未立即出發採購。如萬昌，志豐等，採辦米糧到滬售出，米款亦未立即送解貸款銀行。又查江北公司貸款支票，存根有支付與前綫日報凌子文及汪祖棨者，前後數字達二千萬元左右，均有將貸款移作別用之重大嫌疑，此其三。諸如此類，不勝枚舉，而負有監督考核責任之糧政處不予過問，失職之咎，委無可辭。（七）查四月下旬，當米價步漲之際，糧政處籍口市塲發生糾紛，逕令糧貸採辦之米停止出售，前後延續達十餘日之久，積米達一萬七千石之巨，致使其他糧商，咸抱觀望，市塲有求無供，米價因以狂漲，（按四月二十六日薄稻價每石三萬五千元，至五月十一日竟達四萬八千元），其處置失當，顯然可見。（八）查各糧貸商申請貸款時，每家須繳審查費五六萬元，糧食部核定之貸款辦法，旣無此項規定，顯係巧立名目，乘機圖利，實有凟職之重大嫌疑。（九）糧貸總額計九億四千萬元，而所收利息，僅月息三分，國庫支出如許鉅款，舉辦糧貸，而主持糧政人員，不能上體國家財政之困難，下恤民生之艱苦，因利乘便，</p>
<h3>耗損國帑為害民生</h3>
<p>其用心與行為，實為法紀所不容。（十）滬市糧政特派員楊錫志，現在雖已出國，然舉辦糧貸之決定及各種運用，均為該員出國前所預籌，糧貸執行人員，亦為該員所引用，該員出國後，特派員辦公處處務實由該處秘書汪達人代理，糧貸種種，亦由該員承上而啓下，調節科科長任星崖，尤為實際執行之人，當貸款核定之時，與論攻擊，已甚猛烈，糧政處當局竟敢　此不韙，亳無顧忌，該汪達人等，何所恃而無恐，其幕後主持者又為何人，是滅國家治亂所繫，狐狸豺狼，自非同受顯戮，實不足以正本而淸源。</p>
<p>綜上所述，上海市糧政特派員楊錫志，糧食部專員兼上海特派員辦公處秘書代理處務汪達人，調節科科長任星崖，糧食部田糧署署長兼糧食部東南區特派員長江區糧食儲運委員會主任委員李崇年，利用職權，勾結商人，造成滬市糧食風潮，貽禍民生，實為違法失職，並犯貪汚凟職重大嫌疑，合依修正非常時期監察權行使暫行辦法第二條第一項規定，呈奉監察院核准，提出糾舉，以上各員，及有關糧商，除涉及刑事部分，移送法院偵訊外，即希查照，依法辦理，並將辦理情形見覆為荷。此致行政院。監察院江蘇監察區監察使程中行。</p>
<h3>全市身份證月半前頒發可竣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據市府民政處消息：全市三十區之國民身份證，大部業已頒發竣事。其中僅四區尚未將身份證送往該處蓋印，身份證尚有一部份未送到者，亦有四五區。惟均望能於本月十五日以前，辦理竣事。</p>
<h3>受押金磚案偵訊　重慶銀行經理等分別扣押交保</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行巨竊案，因收押金磚而牽涉上海市銀行，重慶銀行，勤泰錢莊，鑫大股票公司，內情複雜，該案移解地檢處後，財部當局亦甚重視，鑒于有關各行莊擅自收押金磚及債票，違反金融規則，殊屬非法，特訓令澈查。地檢處前日下午曾傳集各有關行莊，開首次偵查庭，歷數小時之久，認為重慶銀行上海分行經理吳明剛，上海市銀行營業科長兼襄理潘家鏐，鑫大股票公司負責人王家楣等數人，罪嫌重大，予以扣押。至重慶銀行上海分行總經理朱芝菲，塗改賬目部份，因非本案賬目，故准予交保外出。勤泰錢莊兪時暘，則着繳現金保二百萬元去。</p>
<h3>糧政處奉令撤銷　另設上海儲運處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：上海市糧政特派員辦公處，頃奉糧食部訓令，着即裁撤，並限於六月底以前，將一應未了事項，結束完竣。而糧食部對滬市各項糧政，業已決定將糧食之管制事項，電請上海市政府交社會局主管，田賦徵收事項，交財政局主管。至糧食部在滬軍糧之收發，糧食加工工廠之督導及管理，以及其他有關糧食食品之收發業務，即將另設上海糧食儲運處辦理。並悉已派楊錫志為儲運處處長，葉新明，汪達人為副處長。</p>
<h3>復員靑年軍　廣東隊昨抵滬　福建隊今返閩</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第二批復員靑年軍廣東總隊二千三百人內有女性七人，由團長涂澄淸率領，於昨日下午一時自杭抵滬。北站歡迎羣衆較前更為踴躍，隊伍下車時，由格致公學童軍樂隊前導，步行經老靶子路四卡子橋後，分赴韜朋路及昆明路營房休息。今日各界舉行歡迎大會，改於市體育館舉行，由市黨部吳紹澍主委任主席。至前日抵滬之福建總隊，定今晨八時在外灘十三號碼頭集中，乘「明興」「舟山」兩輪返閩，今日下午將有第三批混合總隊二千餘人抵滬，內有上海區隊三十五人。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市各界歡迎前抵滬之首批復員靑年軍大會，昨晨八時於美琪大戲院舉行，到官兵二千餘人，各界出席代表有市長吳國楨，市黨部莊鶴礽，市臨參會傅統光，市商會王曉籟等，行禮如儀後，首由市長致詞，略謂靑年軍成立於國家最危急之時，諸位能投筆從戎，不惜犧牲，余今日謹代表全上海市民致至高無上之敬禮。諸位或有以未能在沙塲殺敵為憾，然自政府立塲言，決不願意諸位輕易犧牲，蓋諸君均為最優秀之幹部，實為奠立將來徵兵制度之最好基礎。目前上海風氣俘華者靡，一般市民均缺乏國家觀念及民族意識，諸位在滬期間，希望處處能表現新軍人之革命精神，「為靑天白日旗而生，亦為靑天白日旗而死」，以為全滬市民之表率，而糾正不良風氣。詞畢由學生總會王微微小姐代表各界向全體官兵獻花致敬。繼由黨部莊鶴礽，臨參會傅統先相繼致詞後，由靑年軍代表協和大學學生黃懷瑾致答詞，表示感謝各界之盛意招待，此後決努力於建國工作以完成三民主義之新中國。最後餘興開始，節目有鄧國慶之藝技表演，及放映中電新片「還我故鄕」，至十二時半始盡歡而散。</p>
<p>常玉淸受審時裝聾（顧廷鵬攝）</p>
<h3>殺人不怕血腥氣　工頭出身作風無賴　老賊常玉淸受審　假惺惺吃素唸佛言次雙手合十　答供時裝聾作啞賴得乾乾淨淨　蕭庭長冒火痛加申斥</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在抗戰初期，曾住在淪陷未久的上海的人，聽見了「黃道會」三個字，一定會毛骨悚然的。因為在他的眼前，將呈現出八個掛在電綫桿上的頭顱，頸口滴着鮮血，臉上露出難以形容的恐怖相，而這些頭上，還掛着一張紙條，用鮮紅的顏色，（也許就是志士們的鮮血！）寫了八個嚇人的字，「看看，愛國者的結果！」這件衹有專制魔王才做得出的罪行，曾經擾亂了當時的人心。然而那個主持「黃道會」橫暴殺戮愛國志士的大漢奸常玉淸，到今日，終於束手受我國家法庭的審鞫了。</p>
<p>常為湖北江陵人，六十二歲，戰前不過是個上海日商豐田·同興·大康等紗廠的工頭，兼黃浦灘碼頭鐵工會的會長，從民國廿六年起，勾結日寇西川大板與傅筱庵等，籌組「維持會」未成，他又勾結日本浪人高橋上井和日軍部的連絡員許飛等，組織「黃道會」，將四川路新亞飯店作為大本營，無惡不作，把上海造成了一個空前恐怖的局面。甚至連「維新政府」的魁首梁鴻志，也不滿意他的行動了，他才溜到南京組織「安淸幫會」，招收門徒，仍為敵人作爪牙。</p>
<p>昨日上午受鞫時，常逆穿一件藍色綢長衫，雙袖外捲，露出白色的襯衣，脚上穿黑布鞋，說起話來大姆指一動一動，不失「白相人」作風。可是他走起路來，脚似上了銬，說是腰子壞了。答供的時候，裝聾作啞，有意答錯法官的問題。單是「工頭」一職之是否問題，他足足攪了七分鐘，連蕭庭長也光起火來了。至於主使「黃道會」殺人一節，他更賴得乾乾淨淨。他說：「我平日吃素奉佛，連殺雞也怕的人，那裏會去殺人呢？我的身體又是這樣胖，路也走不動。」言次且雙手合十，故作虔敬。蕭庭長當卽斥道：「梁鴻志是你的同道，也承認你的事，而且表示不滿，你還要賴嗎？」常略頓輕聲說：「他要這樣說，我也沒有辦法。」可是蕭庭長却更進一步說道：「全上海幾百萬人刦知道你的罪行，都說是你殺害的，他們和你無仇無怨，為什麼要推到你頭上呢！」常卽支吾不能作答，好久，才喃喃說：「我從來沒有做過壞良心的事。」嗣經庭上按照起訴書所列罪行，一一嚴訊後，卽論改期再訊，被吿還押。常逆走到法庭外，却一反其剛才之病態，頓足呼不平，說法官不讓他說話，可是法警却把他很快地送回監獄去了。</p>

<h3>六月十八「龍會」　澳洲華僑生活好　一年一度盛大舞會　收入捐助祖國救濟　鄭公使夫人談片</h3>
<p>「澳洲一共有華僑一萬一千人，他們中間雖有許多人因為久居異國，不大明瞭中國的近况，可是澳洲的華僑，始終未曾忘記祖國，對於祖國同胞遭受的痛苦，特別關心，他們每年貢獻給國家的金錢，數目極大」。駐澳公使鄭亦同夫人陳樂異女士昨天和記者談起澳洲華僑情形時說。</p>
<p>鄭亦同氏在去年八月奉命出任駐澳公使，月前回公回國，出席陪都重要會議。鄭夫人則隨同來滬。下星期內就要帶兩位公子一同返澳，另有四位男女公子已經在去年到澳洲了。鄭夫人是杭州人，能操流利的上海話和英語。</p>
<p>鄭夫人告訴記者，在澳洲每年六月十八日華僑們必定要舉行一個盛大的舞會，他們稱它是「龍會」，在這會舉行的前三月，請帖就要發到各地去，可見他們是多麼重視這個一年一度的盛會了。可是他們並非借此歡樂一下而已，這舞會每年所得的門票，除了那天的開支外，完全寄回中國送給蔣夫人作為救濟事業之用。每年的揭幕典禮，按例當由公使夫婦主持的，今年因為鄭公使還有要公未了，不能按時回去主持，所以鄭夫人急於先回澳洲，也就為了這事。</p>
<p>旅澳華僑多數是廣東或福建人，他們將花邊繡花等手工品運到澳洲去出售，營業都非常的好。澳洲出產大量的水果和鮮花，但是要買裝飾最美麗的鮮花或水果，都要到華僑開的鋪子裏去。</p>
<p>在澳洲的英國人和本地人對於華僑的態度可稱相當和善，不過他們為了國策起見，是不大歡迎大批僑民入境的。（本報記者邁天）（鄭公使與夫人見上圖）</p>

<h3>小學課程研究座（五）　英文不應列入小學課程</h3>
<p>我對於編訂小學課程標準，是一個門外漢，但我認爲現在上海小學校將英文列入小學三年級課程之一，（雖則課程標準方面沒有規定）是很値得研究和商榷的。小學敎育是國民的基本敎育，小學三年級的學生，年齡通常在十歲以下，他們跨進校門未久，對於本國文字才有一點淺薄的認識，照現在小學課程，除了國語之外，還有算術，常識，公民等科目，這對於一個十歲以下的學童已感相當的繁劇，如果再添列英文課程，請問如何消化得了？常見學童放學回家溫習功課時，忽中忽英，頭昏腦脹，煞是苦悶，結果以腦力有限，對於英文所得無幾，而國語反因功課太繁關係，未能打定良好基礎。觀於最近小學生之中文程度普遍日趨低落，足資明證。筆者認爲　訂小學課程標準，應以灌輸學童智力所及的基本學科爲標準，爲培養學童體格起見，踝程不宜繁重，英文絕無列入小學課程之必要。英文一科，在成年就業，固然相當重要，不妨自初中一年級起，列爲課程之一，對於有機會受中學敎育的人，並不算過遲。我相信這不僅是我個人的意見，恐怕也是大多數家長的呼聲吧！（盧公武，卅五，六，十，於上海交通銀行。）</p>
<h3>星東聯軍換佈新陣　今日迎戰黑馬猶太　下午五時半在逸園球場</h3>
<p>香港星東足球聯軍，出征來滬，首戰以六比零輕取英海軍，第二塲以四對一智擒西聯，聲勢之盛，一時無兩，星東全隊隊員，氣力充沛，傳遞佳妙，進可攻，退足守，球藝上乘，滬上球迷，莫不熱烈擁戴。今日下午五時卅分，該隊第三次出戰，與素稱黑馬之猶太隊會仗於陜西南路逸園球塲，門券價目照舊，下午三時起，在市體育館開始發售，裁判蔣吟僧，巡邊員陳吉祥金家標。</p>
<p>今日星東聯軍，重佈新陣，昨據隊長許竟成公佈，除門將朱兆恒未有更動外，許隊長反串左後衛，中堅一職，改由霍耀華擔任，郭英祺拜掛帥印，馮景祥與黎兆榮，因後日將與東華會戰，今日小休，以資養精蓄銳，觀此新陣，防守方面，得許隊長之坐鎭，將更見堅固，霍躍華之中堅，必能面面俱到，張金海右移，輔以郭英祺之中軍，攻擊力不致減退，且郭之鐵腿，有目共賞，今日相逢猶太，不難一鼓成擒。</p>
<p>猶太出塲兵馬，昨亦安排妥當，以應付客軍，猶太素稱黑馬，戰鬥力量，神出鬼沒，奧列維拉之中堅，全滬無出其右，攻守均恰到好處，加以老將地飛，東山再起，與大虫法凡笑搭檔，堪稱珠聯璧合，萊凡輔左，（但或將由W潘脫遜下塲）萊遼退爲生力軍，陣容經此改排，實力益增，然仍恐難敵遠征大軍。茲將今日兩軍陣容錄后：</p>

<h3>治黃商榷（一）</h3>
<p>— 褚同安</p>
<p>本文是褚同安先生讀了本報五月十日所載楊孟明先生「化水患爲水利」一文而寫的。褚先生研究水利多年，博覽羣籍，更參以實際考察經騐，文中列舉各點，與楊先生一文頗多互相發明的地方。故亟爲刋出，以供當局及海內治黃專家之參考。　——編者</p>
<p>黃河，黃河，這條千百年來爲害中原的大河，當它每次泛濫而潰決的時候，狂怒的洪流，不知給它吞沒了多少人畜，毀滅了多少財富；這條難以馴服的毒龍，怎樣才可以使它就範呢？怎樣才可以化有害爲有利呢，這是我國當前復興建設的最迫切切最關心的問題。今就管見所及，有所建議，願國內有識賢達，加以商討。</p>
<p>（甲）黃河泛濫潰決的原因</p>
<p>欲整治黃河，第一必須先明白它的泛濫潰決的原因，然後可以對症發藥，加以療治。今分析其原因如下：</p>
<p>（一）土質太鬆　黃河流域是片廣大的黃土地帶，北起綏遠，西至陝甘，給萬千年來漠北的朔風吹來了無數的沙漠中細砂，這些細砂，一年復一年的堆積起來，便形成了今日這塊厚厚的黃土層，但這種土質是非常鬆的，極易被水冲刷，所以在這上面經流的黃河，泥沙自然極易冲入河床，而形成過多的現象；並且由於土質的欠堅，以之建築隄防，亦易崩潰。</p>
<p>（二）地形高低不均　黃河自星宿海發源，經過上流的山嶺地帶，至中衛以下，漸入平原地帶，流勢較緩；至綏遠的托克托河口，折而向南，經過秦普山地時，在叢山夾峙中，七百里間，下瀉八百尺，流得非常湍急；至經砥柱山時，又陡落二百尺，尤顯湍急；但自孟津而下，以達於海，約二千餘里所經的華北黃土大平原，地形平坦，孟津拔海不及百尺，自然河流緩擾，泥沙在河床易於沉積，浸致成爲河身高於平地的局面。河流的太急太緩，亦爲造成水患的一個原因。</p>
<p>（三）全流域缺少森林湖泊，可供蓄洩水量　本來陰山，溫中，以及陜，甘的北部，都有大量的森林，由於歷來濫行斫伐的結果，現在陜，甘，靑，寧，綏，晋，已沒有所謂森林了，都是些童山禿嶺，不能含蓄水份。而全流域又是風砂堆成的黃土地帶，更沒有一片湖泊，可能蓄洩黃河的水量；於是，整個流域的雨量，便只有黃河自身來容納，而沒有一些調節了。</p>
<p>（四）氣候的影響　黃河流域的氣候，是大陸性的，平常雨量非常少，在四五月間，往往歷久無雨，而成旱災；但因夏季過份的熱，（室內溫度有時高至百餘度）與南方季候風的侵襲，空氣中水份已增，待夏末秋初，北方高氣壓的寒風侵入後，於是就造成大雨，往往連續至數日，遍及全流域。這些大雨下在黃土質的童山上，可能使乾涸的山澗，立刻成鴛流量極洪的山川，水量相差，何至數百倍。這樣普遍的大水，一旦都歸到黃河裏，黃河不能承受，便潰決泛濫，而不可收拾了。</p>
<p>現在我們可以觀察一下黃河的水患：我們知道「河患」經常是發生在「下游」一段的，黃河在孟津的河面，約爲三里，自此以下，黃河的河面狹處約有五里，闊處約爲十里，但黃河經常有水流的河床，闊不過數十丈，深不及尋丈，以道樣的水流量，本來何至於水患呢？但當流域內大部份發生普遍的大雨時，那就有「秋水驟至，百川歸河」的現像發生；並且由於砥柱等處來扼，流勢更顯得湍激萬分。以這樣頃刻驟漲數十百倍流量的河床，再加上一股非常澎湃洶湧的流勢，冲刷到黃土所造成的河堤上，自然很容易崩坍和潰決了。其實匪特黃河，北方較小的河流，也往往可以造成水患。例如黃水支流的洛水，這條有時沒有水的河，也曾淹沒過偃師縣，只爲運續兩大的大雨而已。大雨而沒有森林湖泊可以蓄積調節，乃是黃河水患的主因。河床泥沙沉積，河身日高，土質鬆散，堤防不固，乃是黃河潰決的副因。</p>
<p>（乙）整治黃河之我見</p>
<p>（一）長江與黃河整治的比較　明白黃河泛溫潰決的原因，便可擬具一個整治的計劃。現在先把黃河與長江作個比較，長江也不是有百利而無一害的。長江之有三峽，正如黃河之有砥柱，水勢一樣非常急。三楚的低地——雲夢平原，正如黃河下游的大平原，所以也築下了千里長堤來防範它。但長江水位之差旣沒有黃河的利害，又有洞庭湖，鄱陽湖等諸大湖泊，可供調節水量，所以並無嚴重的水患。但近來洞庭湖日益淤浸，於是兩湖一帶也就時常閙着水災了。最近美國的氷利專家薩凡奇博士來　考察長江水利，他認爲　　能在宣昌以西的三峽口，　造了水閘，把三峽地帶閘成一片狹長形的人工湖，那末，長江上游的水量，非但可以得到調節，而三楚的水患也可永遠免除，即使洞庭湖究全淤塞，也不成問題。並且還可藉此水力，以發出大量的電力來，普遍地供給到整個華中地域，使農工業電氣化，這樣便一變長江的有害部份爲最有利部份，雖然要投資十三億美元，但這項投資，是很可能在最短期內本利收回而綽有餘裕的。由此可見運用建築水閘的技術，以造成「人工湖」，不但可以調節水量，並且還能利用其水力以發電。那末，依據黃河漲水時的水量，假使能揀個適當地點建一水閘，不是也可以化有害爲有利嗎？但那裏才是最適當的地點呢？（未完）</p>

<h3>獄中散記（三）</h3>
<p>— 姚隼</p>
<p>生命的啟示</p>
<p>每天，淸晨起來，我端着一張小竹凳，到監獄中的內天井旁坐下，抬頭仰望那寬約三尺長約三丈的一線靑天，靜看着陽光投射在三四丈高的磚牆項上，慢慢地移了下來。有幾隻家雀在牆角啁啁唧唧地嘻戲着，一會兒交頭接頸，一會兒展翅並飛，一會兒又乘人不備，撲了下來，啣着一粒剩飯，又飛上了牠們的巢裏，喂養着牠們的小雛。</p>
<p>過了一些時候，便有着幾隻小麻雀，在跟着牠們的父母學飛了。</p>
<p>在這監獄里，所可以看到的生物，除了這些家雀之外，還有一對安哥拉兎子。這大概是所長或者那一位看守養的吧，但始終沒有看到牠們的主人來看顧牠們。牠們整天睜着一雙紅眼睛，披着一身潔白的柔軟的長毛，成雙成對地在木柵子內外跳來跳去，檢吃着我們吃剩掉下的囚糧。</p>
<p>這是兩隻淘氣的傢伙，他們到處地亂竄，一邊嗅着，一邊挖着，什麽都要吃，尤其是到了晚上，更是不肯安份，甚至連難友們私下添的菜肴，也給偷吃掉，上面蓋着的碗都給打翻了，淸早起來，發現連鞋子都給牠們拖到洞里去了。</p>
<p>但是，牠們並沒有遭到斥責。在這監獄中，這一對小生命是備受着人們的愛　和優遇的。難友們都把牠們當作寳貝看待、閒來就抱起牠們愛撫着，或者蹲下來，撮着嘴唇呦呦作聲，逗着牠們玩，甚至把自己僅有的可憐的食物，也分出一部份喂給牠們。牠們的生活種種，都受着人們的異常關切。</p>
<p>不久以前，有一天，我們發現牠們在廁所附近的牆角下挖了一個洞，那個洞造得很精緻，爬在洞口的土，牠們都用後脚推平在地上，使人們不容易發現痕跡，洞里面舖着啣來的稻草和牠們身上脫下的細毛，而在洞口却連一根草屑都看不到，但終於被我們發現了，一經探視，原來什麼時候牠們已經養下了一對小崽子，眼睛已經會得張開了，皮毛也已經長得豐滿，於是，大家便一窠蜂似地把這兩團毛茸茸的小生命抱到蓆子上，圍着牠們，搶着用粗黑的手掌去愛撫牠們，跟牠們祝福，一直鬧了大半天，就像一羣大孩子一般。後來又天天捉着母兎，替她們喂奶。現在，這兩隻小崽子，也能够在木柵子內外跳跳蹦蹦地了。</p>
<p>這些小生物，對我是一種啓示。</p>
<p>生命是神秘的，不可思議的。在某些待候看來，是非常脆弱的。隨時都會喪失的；但同時又是吳常堅　的？不管在任何的環境之下，都要生存下去的，不是　，就是在這死亡的監獄里，僅僅靠着囚犯們吃剩的唾餘，那家雀和兎子還照樣地要生活着，而且還要延續着後嗣，使這小小的生命不至於斷絕。</p>
<p>這正如耶穌基督所說的：「……不要爲生命憂慮：吃什麽，喝什麽；爲身體憂慮；穿什麽。生命不勝於飲食麽？身體不勝於衣裳麽？你們看那天上的飛烏，也不種，也不收，也不積蓄在倉里，你們的天父尙日養活他，你們不比飛烏貴重得多麼」？</p>
<p>所以，就應該懂得，爲什麽在監獄里，那些被判處無期徒刑的犯人們，家里斷了接濟，親友們也不來探視，僅僅就靠着一份吃不飽餓不死的囚糧，也能够倔强地生活着。</p>
<p>生命是脆弱的，但更是堅靱的。我將要更執着地生活下去。</p>
<p>在這監獄里，我偶然翻到了一張包東西進來的舊報紙，在那報屁股上有一篇並不驚人的文章，裏面引用了瑞典的一位哲學家都依。遜密斯的「犯罪理論」中的幾句話說：「……立法者才是有罪的，他的判決者，即是犯人，……成功一個囚犯，是因爲他沒有欺詐的才能。……」</p>
<p>這幾句話，給我以深深的感觸。假使是以前我在外面讀到了這幾句話，或許會覺得這是一種文人的濫調，最少也有點言過其實，但現在。我由於親眼看到的，和親耳聽到的種種事實，才知道他的這話中有着眞理。　（未完）</p>
<h3>雨夜</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>又是一個凄涼的雨夜。</p>
<p>近來我眞害怕雨夜，我怕那如怨如訴的浙浙瀝瀝之聲；我怕那昏黑迷亂中的驚雷和閃電；我怕那無情的冷風擊打我的窗子；我怕那灰的牆，黑的影，恐怖的天，渾沌的地。</p>
<p>我披了一件薄薄的外套坐在窗前，我默默地注視着一盞慘淡的燈，我已無淚可落，無聲可嘆，然而我還是痛苦，還是要回憶。</p>
<p>我回憶起曾徑在同樣一個凄凉的雨夜，我坐在這盞慘淡的燈下寫信給她。我吿訴她我感激她的懷念，我謝謝她的安慰，但最要緊的，我是想吿訴她：</p>
<p>「現在是渾沌的黑夜，我知道你是醒着，你走吧！」</p>
<p>我把一張潔白的信箋鋪在桌上，我的筆尖在上面不停地移動，可是寫到這一句，我的手指顫抖了，我心中湧起一個疑問：我是如此渺小，我能這樣寫給她嗎？</p>
<p>我自以爲謹愼，自以爲聰明，於是，我到底沒有寫上那一句話。</p>
<p>豈料，那一點謹愼，造成了永遠的悔恨；那一點聰明，留下了無底的痛心！</p>
<p>渾沌的黑夜過去了，可是，她已不能再見到光明的天日，我已不能再見到她溫柔的容顏。</p>
<p>今夜，又是一個凄凉的雨夜。我已無淚可落，無聲可嘆，然而，我還是痛苦，還是忘不了那個不幸的朋友！</p>
<h3>長篇連載　雙宿雙飛（五二）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>儘管廖老闆是這樣宣傳，但抵不住洋大夫的百發百中的效騐吸引了人們，沒有誰會相信洋大夫是欺騙，也沒有誰會相信廖老闆的話是眞實！回春堂的生意冷淸下來事小，廖老闆的一番普救衆生的好心白費了，這使他悲哀！廖老闆對於希望人類健康的這種心理，一點沒有虛僞，只是他固執地認爲洋大夫的治療和那些洋藥之所以發生效騐，並不是洋大夫的醫道高明，或洋藥好；而是一來是病患者機緣的徼幸，二來是洋大夫和洋藥走了運！無論如何，用剪子，刀，治病，這是廖老闆不敢，也不能恭維的！</p>
<p>可是，事實上竟然洋大夫和洋藥流行以來，病患者痊愈的居多，死亡的絕無。這樣日子久了，廖老闆的氣憤又稍稍平息了些，因爲他曾冷靜的想過，只要大家健康，就好！雖然每天晚上　鈴結賬的時候，一頁一空白」，對於他是一樁難堪的痛苦！尤其老闆娘叨叨不休，越發使他煩惱，但他能够本乎慈悲之懷，克制了自私本能的發達。</p>
<p>廖老闆究竟不失爲一個良善忠厚的好大！</p>
<p>老闆娘是女人，是沒有受過好敎養的女人；而且是天生氣量窄狹；出身屠戶之家的女人；因此，她不可能像廖老闆那樣豁達，仁義！她已經忍了許久，終於有一天她忍無可忍了，找了岔兒，向廖老闆「大興問罪之師」了！</p>
<p>『日子這樣越過越緊，我可受不了！眼看就要年關近，家裏不能不宰頭猪，醃點臘肉。』老闆娘氣冲冲地說。三句話不離本行，一開口她總忘不了「猪」，一開口她總喜歡「宰」呀「殺」的。</p>
<p>「生意不好，今年過年少不得要遷就點！能够不欠債就是萬幸，還宰的啥子猪。」廖老闆滿腔沉鬰地操着四川口音說。</p>
<p>這一來老闆娘可抓住了話柄，她立刻單刀直人地冷笑着說：</p>
<p>『嘻嘻！生意不好有什麼要緊？只要人不生病，就是賠錢也是情願呀！』</p>
<p>『你少跟老子酸潭子！現在不是沒得人生病，是別人生了病，不來買我們的藥。因爲他們迷信洋大夫，只買洋藥。』</p>
<p>『啊，原來是這樣！那更沒有什麼要緊咯！只要洋藥能治好人家的病，不買我們的藥也隨他去好了，反正你廖老闆是一向慈悲爲懷的。』老闆娘越發極盡諷刺地說。</p>
<p>『就是這個道理，所以生意才不好呀！』</p>
<p>廖老板說這話的意思，滿以爲老闆娘會諒解他了，不再提宰猪過年的事了，誰知老闆娘不但不能諒解他，而且這回把臉一沉，乾脆發了脾氣。</p>
<p>『生意不好，那是你舖子裏的事；宰猪過年，這是我家裏的事；你能遷就，我可不能遷就！你旣是對別人慈悲，也該對我娘兒們發發慈悲才是！我嫁給你，不是來陪你受罪的！』</p>
<p>「你想哪（四川音讀「冷」）個？你不要逼急了老子！」廖老閣也發脾氣了，廖老闆一發脾氣，便要用他的道地四川話駡人。</p>

<h3>在各方爭先搶購之下　美鈔繼續上漲　金價又被帶好六萬</h3>
<p>烚赤昨繼續邁進，主動者仍屬美鈔，晨開即站一九〇萬大關，開後在平穩狀態下，盤旋而升，十時後已升至一九三萬以上。中行配售業中三三〇條，價一九三萬，入後略有回挫，無如美鈔急進，套買者多，午刻漲到一九六萬，午後初時尙平，隔日交割開始，曾漲至一九七萬，而後逢壓力而轉平，結果較前收漲起六萬，飾金提升至念萬零八，紋銀仍平，銀元再吿微升，暗拆仍在一角二至一角半間。</p>

<h3>申請外滙　須經事前審核</h3>
<p>中央銀行爲免外匯浪費起見，除通知指定銀行按照規定注意辦理外，並對各行商之外匯申請書，須經由中央銀行，作事前之審核，如不按規定申請者，即停售外匯，關於准許進口之物資，如各行商有爭購情形時，該行可酌予核減，如購買國內缺乏之物資，亦可特予核准，所訂辦法具有彈性。</p>
<p>又據該行負責人表示，中央銀行爲管制外匯審愼辦理起見，經通吿本市各指定辦理外匯之中外銀行，凡各該銀行在結售外匯之際，事先須對結匯者之資歷及用加途以愼重之考慮，如：（一）辦理進口者，是否係直接用戶，（二）如經營一般進口業者，對於是項進口，是否已與廠商或承銷者訂立合同，或（三）如係進口貨品之承銷商，是否在太平洋戰前經營已有三年之資歷，否則須經中央銀行之特許，又須注意對於對方經營接受所訂貨物之外洋出口商，其信用是否可靠，及進口押匯信用書內必須載有關於該項交易各種應備之保險及檢騐單等，此外中央銀行並請各該指定辦理外匯之銀行注意現已通行之進口申請書內（格式第六A）之規定，「保證所有供給外匯之進口貨品或其同種類同數量之存貨，確係立刻銷售使用」。</p>
<h3>抽籤之後　公債下瀉</h3>
<p>公債昨以抽籤後，公債司負責人對債市漲出實際情形，有不足爲訓之說，略受打擊，統丙晨開卽下瀉至五五五〇元以下，開後有五樓北帮一部了結，曾破五千元大關，空方趁低補進，七樓有两大户扒空，自四九五〇元回好至五二〇〇元光景，结果較前收下跌六五〇元，甲乙跌三百元，丁戊亦降四百元。</p>
<h3>紗市跌風已止　現棉交易頗暢</h3>
<p>昨日紗市轉趨穩定，因金價報漲，雙馬現貨有粵帮搜買，故各大型紗好起二三萬，中小型貨銷滯價平，細紗及雙綫跌風已止，然尙無轉機之象，蓋近數期紡建所開細紗價，逐期貶低十數萬，是以同行咸具戒心，暫時不敢多納。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊濃廿七至卅九磅音，計近期美金二九·〇九，遠期二九·五二，米特林現貨二九·八〇，本埠現棉交易續有起色，緣外棉有力，蘇州蘇　常州大成無錫慶豊等廠相繼採辦。</p>
<h3>布市平穩</h3>
<p>坯布津帮因該處市面良好，來電採買，故十二磅彩球V龍頭細布堅定，蜀，晋，粵，閩，等處對於嗶嘰吸　仍健，漂布現貨緊迫，價又見俏，士林布客帮雖無大量購買，然氣勢漸見發展，中紡午後開售之價平平，細布V龍未有，其他細布五種，並添加開美墨布二十四種，因承購者踴躍，分配單須待明晨發給。</p>
<h3>美物價管制局撤消　豬鬃價格統制</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十一日電〕物價管制局已撤消獸毛及猪鬃（除帚委外）之價格統制，該項原料係國內用以製造刷子及掃帚者。</p>
<h3>金剛鑚　世界需要增多　上海亦在其內</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕上海蘇聯及新嘉坡目前對於金剛鑽之需要，頗爲强烈，拉丁美洲及印度亦然，中東諸國則較和緩，美國仍爲需要甚多之國家，蓋美國人民似頗担心通貨膨脹也，加里福尼亞州之需要尤爲强烈，此係因富人遷居該地及州稅較低之故，總之，世界需要更多之金剛鑽，（正如需要更多之金，銀，鉑之類，）超過目前可能供給之數量，結果其價格勢必將遠較管定價格爲高。</p>
<h3>請看今日之美國　鈔票多於物品　有錢無處購買</h3>
<p>政府限價過嚴廠商停止生產</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據昨日自美抵滬之美國鉅商里達氏語記者稱：目前美國鈔票多於物品，已發生有錢無處購貨之現象，由於工潮之接遍不斷，生產大受打擊同時因政府限價過嚴，商人自動中止出品，例如皮鞋一項，政府限價爲六元，但製造商要求增至十元，政府予以拒絕，商方以無利可圖，遂自動中止製造，目前皮鞋，襯衫等物，在美國極難購得，重達氏復稱中國方面雖大量向美國訂貨，但本年內恐難交貨云。</p>
<h3>華茶外銷仍寂</h3>
<p>日來本市同業方面，爲積極推廣華茶出口起見，屢將茶樣寄往國外，近悉南美洲消息，各種紅綠茶樣，均已相繼收到，且對於貨品尙爲滿意，惟終嫌價太昂，據彼地意思，每磅若美金三角五分至四角餘之間，始有巨胃採納，然本市茶商以成本關係，一時殊難割愛，依現狀觀察，華茶外銷恐暫無開朗之象，至於內銷花色，本街店莊添置仍亟，但近鄕一帶，受隔日天雨之影響，辦就之貨，均未裝出，是以胃納不比上日活躍，惟執貨者，售意仍緊，市勢依然穩秀。</p>
<h3>中砂漲四千元</h3>
<p>昨糖市以敵產貨及台灣公司均乏開出，趨勢愈緊，再度上漲、公會劃盤上午中砂白現貨初爲七萬五千元，後雙包七萬六千元，單袋六千五百元，下午雙包七萬七千元至七千五百元，升四千元，棧單七萬三千五百元，直升至七千五百元，升四千餘元，二十二號中砂白劃八萬一千元，號貨開出棉湖赤數十包，七萬八千元，刁靑六萬二千元，次之六萬元升四五千元，提靑六萬四五千元</p>
<h3>烟煤回降　連日到煤甚旺</h3>
<p>烟煤廠銷，因節後多數工廠減低生產，消化略見疲滯，並有停工廠家，鑒於最近烟煤市價超過配價頗巨，均托煤商同業轉售市場，供貨寬裕，又五月份燃管會允配煤商同業烟煤五千公噸，（內開平二號屑二千五百公噸及關平火車統煤二千五百公噸配價與前同），多數同業因傳廠用配給煤由公會轉配空氣濃厚，故同意接受上項配給煤，是以各同業存有者，咸具戒心，恐再度被壓牢，紛起斬割，行情迅速回降。</p>
<p>據燃料管理委員會，昨日發表，今日亨利號輪，由秦皇島運到煤九六五〇噸，又昨日由英輪荷達馬勒號運到煤一萬餘噸，該項煤斤，俱係開　煤礦所出產，又明日亦可望有巨額煤斤運到，均將配給本市各國營民營工廠應用</p>
<h3>人心俏·銀根鬆　華股市况極通暢　外股上塲即被帶好</h3>
<p>華股初平後堅，補空者稍股，大股異常堅俏，小股雖升而有限，趨勢已吿光明，晨初低價時永紗五六〇〇元，美亞四一〇〇元，景福二九五元，新光二八五元，勤興二一八元，低價不久卽被拉上，盤旋而升，中途尙形平庸，近午廣帮進永紗，加之受金鈔影響，人心俏，銀根鬆，結果永紗漲半成，美亞好一成，景福雖升而不多，新光勤興各好半成强，冷門各股以時間不及，雖升而不多，外股開市已届金鈔華股堅俏之時，是以上塲卽被帶好，怡紗站定一二〇〇〇元外，開後繼續趨升，結果較前收計怡紗英聯會德豐各升一成光景，小股較遜雖升而不多，亞洲以市價最賤，散戶追求，獨好一成。</p>
<h3>中國絲襪運美</h3>
<p>〔路透社費城十一日電〕據「婦女時裝日報」載，由中國及日本運來之絲襪價格每雙美金三元九角四分至九元九角五分，業已在此間出售，惟數量甚少，該批絲襪並未登廣吿招徠，顧客往詢時，即可購得。</p>
<h3>繭行大都停秤　繭價最高近二十萬</h3>
<p>茲據某繭業鉅子談：無錫春繭市自六月三日開秤以來，迄今已屆一週，收繭成績尙佳，惟繭價高低不一，視繭質優劣而定，中蠶以繭價過低，蠶農不肯脫售。曾將繭價酌予提高以維蠶農成本，各繭行亦以競購而增價收買，繭價因而軋高，至本月八日最高價已達十九萬五千元，致使繭行無力收購而報停歇，至昨日止先後停收已達三分之二，而一般蠶農尙冀繭價再漲，相率觀望，故近日成交甚稀。頃春繭市已成尾聲，聞江陰常熟等地繭行，業已停收云。</p>
<h3>米市塲到銷均淡　雜糧油餅升降互見</h3>
<p>昨日米市隨到隨銷，供求兩不見旺，形勢站立，麵粉消化轉呆價疲三四百元，黃豆早緊午懈，生仁回升千餘元，蠶豆去化不振再小千元，苞米跌千元，小麥去路尙可，續加千元，麩皮鄕消活動，回漲一二百元，豆餅漲三四百元，油價亦上升二千餘元，本市到米，據米市塲息，計白粳等七種，共四千餘石，其種類及石數如下。白粳一，七六三石，薄稻九二九石，早稻六五石，羊秈四六八石，杜秈一〇石，蕪秈六一五石，白元一五八石。</p>
<h3>浦江卸貨費太高　最高每噸一萬四千元　駁船汽車費尚不在內</h3>
<p>外埠及海運船隻抵浦江後之卸貨費用，多未遵照規定，任意索取，各輪船公司及進出口商對此均感頭痛，聞各輪船公司，將呈王請政府嚴格規定，以利運輸，關於目前卸貨費用，除招商局較爲低廉，其餘均高，普通貨物，有索至一萬四千元一噸者。茲將招商局及其他各輪船公司之卸貨費用分誌如次：</p>
<p>（一）招商局　每噸卸貨力資爲五千元以一百市斤一件計算，每件二百五十元，此項力資，包括起倉，過檔，直接進棧之上下力，如無碼顯停泊須另僱駁船，每噸二千元，起碼三十噸計算。</p>
<p>（二）其他各輪船公司　每噸卸貨力資，爲一萬四千元，每件七百元亦包括起倉，過檔直接進棧之上下力。如僱用汽車，每件運費爲一千五百元，每噸共計三萬元，如無碼頭可靠，須僱駁船者，每噸需費一萬六千元至二萬元不定。此項力資係以棉花及猪鬃等進口物資而言，如山貨，藥材之費用，每件另加百分之五十，每噸需力資二萬一千元，如僱汽車或駁船，當不照加。</p>
<h3>揚子公司股票</h3>
<p>倫敦市價漸有起色</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕標準晚報稱，揚子公司普通優先股價格近已至一先令九便士，原因似係鑒於對日戰事結束以後，該公司在華之礦權及其他權利業已發生價値。</p>
<p>戰事爆發前，英方曾與中國官方協議籌設一中英合組機構，從事四川境內之礦產，工業及其他事業，旋因戰事關係談判中止甚久，該公司資本計三〇〇，一四〇鎊，已收一六八，〇一三鎊。</p>
<h3>中央銀行負責當局談　美鈔步漲純係投機作用</h3>
<p>外滙資源充足無虞匱乏　更動匯率徒然刺激物價</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕邇來匯率放長，幣制改革之說，甚　塵上，美鈔黃金市况，節節盤高，記者特以有關問題多則，走詢中央銀行負責當局，承吿；渠向以實事求是，埋頭工作爲前提，故對外界一切揣測臆斷。始終不聞不理，只以坦白之事實，爲一切謠諑最有力之　辯，三月來處理外匯及黃金之經過，已可見一般。最近合衆社紐約電傳我國改革幣制之訊，渠稱純屬無稽之談，而投機家竟藉以爲外匯另施新辦法之前奏，大事鼓吹，殊不知當局早已成竹在胸，凡百措施，務求以顧全四萬五千萬同胞之福利爲前提，茲者米價騰漲之氣燄方熄，遽而於目前更動匯率，於出口事業未必有助，而物價却跟踵騰漲，是不啻助桀爲虐，不智熟甚，至匯市前途，應取如何途徑，渠以地位關係，未便亦未願表示意見，外傅某公司等有包辦進口貿易，操縱外匯之嫌，渠本人則未之前聞，且相信亦無人敢一手包辦，並謂任何指控，務求提供眞憑實據，否則信口胡扯，於實際無補絲毫，最近美鈔節節盤高，渠認爲純係投機作用，無理可喩，外匯黃金開放之初，其行市依照原規定，均係隨市上落，茲者匯市始終屹立不動，而金市則日有更動，其理由爲匯市無形中反映法幣對外之幣値，匯市之不動，亦足以示法幣對外幣値。始終穩定逾恒，而黃金則固屬商品之一種，不能與貨幣相提並論，貨物之價格，當然常因供需關係，稍有上落，且世界金價，近來亦略有提高，故本市金價，亦稍稍盤高，至中央銀行之外匯資源，本極充裕，自外匯市塲開放以來，進口商之結匯雖多，而僑匯以及我國在外之凍結資金，出口商之匯款，與最近成功之美棉借款三千餘萬，均足抵銷而有餘，故對外匯之供應，無虞匱乏，最後，渠一再剴切表示，當局對有關全國經濟之重大措施，即有所更動，事前必需審慎考慮，週密計劃，務求更動後，對大衆爲有利，始付諸施行，故市塲一切謠諑流言，切勿輕予聆信，致反爲投機家所乘云。</p>

<p>國際知識　每星期三出版</p>
<h3>舉世矚目的蘇聯　承認大戰危機存在</h3>
<p>本報編譯室特輯</p>
<p>蘇聯是目前最受人注意的一個國家，因爲在第三次大戰中（假使會爆發的話），它將佔着主要的地位。</p>
<p>我們現在先要了解蘇聯的見解，蘇聯共黨機關報眞理報最近刋載莫斯科大學敎授莫的列夫的文章，他說：「目前世界上有許多矛盾的問題，都足以引起戰爭，」這一句已經說明了蘇聯已認定戰爭確有爆發的可能性。</p>
<p>該文最重要的一段是這樣說的：「現在，殖民地間，利用與剝削黃黑二種族的事實，以及强迫全人類接受盎格魯撤克遜國家統治的企圖，暴露了種族的徧見，顯然包含着戰爭的種子。目前世界上有許多矛盾的問題，都足以引起戰爭。列强間唯有從速採取一種根據條約，相互尊重別一國家的人民意志的政策，纔能把危機挽回過來。」</p>
<p>作者的結論，更足以表達目前蘇聯的目的，他警吿各國，認爲「各列强除與蘇聯合作外，別無他途。</p>
<p>史達林不下野　紅軍不致叛變</p>
<p>在另一方面，美國讀者文摘五月份曾載一文，說明蘇聯的內幕，現在把該文重要部份摘錄如次：</p>
<p>許多外國觀察家認爲紅軍指揮官中，具有潛在的叛逆性，這是一種一相情願的想法。紅軍元帥，曾受有適合軍事機構的訓練，而且待遇優厚，但不許有政治的發言權。朱可夫元帥是一個最適當的例子，即使帶有些微政治性的事，如果未曾獲得莫斯科方面的訓示，亦不得決定。若干外國記者對於蘇聯與史達林的關係，完全誤解。他們以爲史達林將逐漸減少權力，但斯達林只有在其身死之後，才會交出政權。他受蘇聯人所尊敬，即有錯誤發生，其咎亦應由其部下所負，史達林的權力，仍舊爲最高且無限制的，能向其自由表示意見的人，只有政治委員會裏的十三個委員。政治委員會戰許是蘇聯唯一的民主機關，在政治委會中勢力最大者，是馬迎可夫，高級官員之升調，由他全權處理，莫洛托夫並不直接參加內政，但是他的國際政治報吿足以左右內政。</p>
<p>最近許多外國觀察家以爲：蘇聯領袖並非共產主義者，已變爲國家主義者，實則他們依然是十足的馬克斯主義者，他們利用國家主義有如利用宗敎一般。</p>
<p>吾人是否即將與蘇聯發生戰爭？此種戰爭的可能性確不能避免，我們能否與蘇聯合作？如果我們所謂合作是像英美，英法，或法比的合作那樣緊密，那末答案是「否」字。但我們可與蘇聯發生商業上的關係。</p>
<p>如果蘇聯的政策繼續不變，我們就不能希望在文化上與知識上和他們發生關係，實則美蘇兩國，從未有交換學生之舉。</p>
<p>許多軍事觀察家預料在史達林死後，蘇聯即將發生內爭，史達林與政治局都曾深切注意及此。在史達林死後，政權仍將保留於政治局中。</p>
<p>現在蘇聯領袖所加於人民的担子，較其他人民爲重，但此等領袖已使蘇聯獲勝，現在他們所盼望的是安全與較好的生活。</p>
<p>軍人出使蘇聯　美蘇關係微妙</p>
<p>在美蘇關係緊張之際，史密斯已繼哈里曼之後出使蘇聯，他能够改善兩國的關係嗎？國際文摘對於這問題的見解，是値得我們注意的，國際文摘著稱：</p>
<p>美國國務院裏的要人們，一致認爲：美國駐蘇大使館，是美國最重要的外交前哨。今後兩年中，在美國駐蘇大使館中發生的事情，足以左右今後二十年中的世界動向。美國和蘇聯的友好關係是否加强，還是削弱，大半須視莫斯科美國大使館的發展趨勢而定。歷史上各國使節所負的使命，恐怕沒有比史密斯今日所肩負的更重大的了。</p>
<p>外交界人士固然很明瞭史密斯所負的使命是促成美蘇兩國間的諒解和親睦，但是有些人對此發生懷疑，以爲美國把艾森豪華爾的最有希望的繼任人安置在克林姆宮的大門口，如何能够得到蘇聯的諒解呢？欲促成世界永久和平，必先袪除一切足以引起猜疑的軍事措置，美國派遣一個軍人來主持美國駐蘇大使館，其用意何在？爲什麽不把史密斯立刻更換一個像華萊斯那樣經騐豐富的文官呢？</p>
<p>這些問題，你可以從華盛頓的海陸軍鄕下總會裏立刻得到解答。凡是和史密斯相熟的軍界人物，都說他最適宜於這一個職位，因爲對蘇聯人說話需要率直堅決的態度，這是史密斯所特有的。事實上史密斯和蘇聯的一等軍人感情十分融洽。</p>
<p>但是美蘇間永遠存在着微妙的關係，史密斯的前身哈立曼在駐蘇期間，不能解決種種糾紛。因此，華感頓的外交界人士咸以懷疑的目光，注視哈立曼的繼任人。自從史密斯開始他的使命以來，他們的關心沒有減退過。</p>
<p>社魯門總統因爲史密斯在第二次世界大戰中熟悉軍事外交家的作風，認為他最適宜於擔任這件增進邦交的工作。有人曾經向史氏建議，美國應把國務院對蘇聯的批評對全世界宣佈。史氏却嚴肅地回答道：「我們要對蘇聯談判。不要對蘇聯批評」。</p>
<p>自從史密斯擔任駐蘇大使以來，「鋼盔外交」變成了華盛頓所注目的一個課題。並非華府官方懷疑史密斯沒有執行和平使命的決心，若干敏感的觀察家所關心的，倒是這麽一回事：全世界正煞費苦心地想從戰爭的水火中跳出來，如果美國能選派一位非軍人的使節到蘇聯去，豈非更加妥善呢？</p>

<h3>十位勇士</h3>
<p>— 原文載英國「星期日快報」，家南編譯</p>
<p>——挽救人類生命——　摧毀納粹原子巢穴</p>
<p>假如在第二次世界大戰中，德國比盟國先發明了原子炸彈，那麽，對於戰爭的結果將有怎樣的影響？今日的世界，又將呈現怎樣一副面目？說德國就此可以轉敗爲勝，固然聳人聽聞，不免言過其實，然而倫敦和莫斯科，這兩個抗戰歐洲的重要堡壘，必然首當其衝，像廣島和長崎的化爲灰燼，就是遠在大西洋彼岸的華盛頓以至中國的戰時首都重慶，恐怕也難倖免。然而，德國爲什麽沒有發明原子炸彈呢？是科學技術的水準不够麽？是德國科學家沒有想到這一點麼？都不是的。德國在這方面失敗的主要原因，我認爲有兩個，第一是爲德國有許多科學家尤其是許多富有天才的德籍猶太科學家，不願爲殺人不眨眼的納粹効勞。人心的向背，自有其天道公理！第二是爲了製造原子炸彈的必要原料，被盟國的特種部隊所毀滅。下面就是有關這件大事的一段驚天動地的故事，名曰「重水」襲擊。</p>
<p>何謂「重水」？「重水」是製造原子炸彈的必要原料，它的科學名稱是Deuterium　Oxide。何謂「重水」襲擊？從字面上就可以看出是襲擊製造「重水」的地方。原來在德國本部以至德國全部佔領區內，惟有挪威維爾莫克城的諾斯克重水廠，生產這種戰時珍貴無比的化學藥品。一九四〇年五月，英國接到了惱人的情報，就是德國已經命令該廠增加「重水」的生產至每年三千磅；一九四二年中，又要求增加至一萬磅。</p>
<p>一九四二年七月，英國內閣主張攻擊維爾莫克，並須趕緊進行。戰時事不宜遲，立即在挪威陸軍選拔軍官兩名和下士兩名，該隊密碼名稱定爲「燕」字。一九四二年十月十五日深夜十一時三十分，他們用降落傘在符傑萊費脫東方的山地着陸。一俟工作獲得初步成功，英國即派滑翔機隊來接應。</p>
<p>挪威地形的困難，是全世界聞名的，到處叢山峻嶺，湍流危谷，一到冬天，全國就變成白皚皚一片銀色世界，這四個挪威軍人和大自然的種種困難粗搏鬥，眞是艱苦萬狀，但是爭取祖國生存和聯合國勝利的碧血丹心，終於戰勝了千辛萬艱，獲得了彌足珍貴的情報。</p>
<p>十一月十九日，飛機兩架拖滑翔機二架自蘇格蘭基地起飛，不幸一架飛機和二架滑翔機在挪威海岸附近失事撞毀，結果不得不重起爐灶，再行訓練特別攻擊隊六名，事情的發展往往不是直綫而是曲綫的。</p>
<p>「燕」隊人員耐性地等着，等着。一九四三年二月十六日午夜，有挪威兵六名在「燕」隊所在地西北方三十英里冰凍的斯克里根湖上降落。在挪威地方，冬季中要走三十里路比溫和地帶走三百里還難，但是在鋼鐵一般的意志之下，雙方終於獲得了聯絡。</p>
<p>兵貴神速，兩隊會合的日期是二月二十一日，出動的日期也是二月二十一日。在這裏，應該特別重視兩點：（一）兩隊人馬的總數雖然不過十人，但是擔任的任務，其決定性決不下於千軍萬馬的大戰塲；（二）在正式戰塲上作戰，一鼓作氣，沒有胆量的人也會變成有胆量的，但是在敵人佔領區內，以少數的人力，越過荒山僻野、冰天霎地，去執行一樁事前毫無把握的任務，事實上需要更大的機警，更大的勇氣。</p>
<p>兩隊人馬在下午八時自根據地出發。他們在抵達離廠門五百公尺之後，停止前進，直等到深夜十二時三十分，然後再謹愼地匍伏向前。隊長根據事前的情報，就派出一人去打開兩扇沒有人守備的鐵門。門上雖然下着鎖，但是經軍用剪截機一截之後，就很容易地被推開了。一聲令下，掩護隊和破壞隊隨後跟進。第二步的任務，就是要破壞電氣分解廠。但是廠房外邊的門關閉得更緊，竟無法奪門而入，唯一的進路，就是地下隧道了。時機稍縱即逝，立即魚貫而入。隧道之內，鉛管縱橫，行進非常困難，突然之間，向對面的窗口望去，看見一個黑影閃過，這就是看守的衛兵，他們當前的敵人！「隆然」一聲，窗被轟破了，衛兵措手不及，當塲就擒。這個難關一過，隊長立即着手敷設火藥，裝就火藥綫，火藥綫一點上，全隊人馬立刻退出，躱在離開二十碼的地方，靜聽好音訊。果然不出所料，轟然一響，聲震天地，這一炸，所毀「重水」在三千磅左右！</p>
<p>一時廠內秩序大亂，原來守前門的衛兵也衝了進來，而襲擊的人却趁此機會從前門溜走了！</p>
<p>好傢伙！就是挪威的德軍總司令也說：「這次襲擊是我有生以來所僅見。」</p>
<p>從此德國人便惴惴不安起來，廠方負責人屢次要求德方把機械和剩餘的「重水」運到德國去，然而茲事體大，德軍方面也不能立即有所決定。但是局勢的日趨緊張，迫使德方最後決定遷移。</p>
<p>這一個消息又爲盟國的特種部隊獲得，立卽向英國上峯報吿，戰時內閣汲回來的命令是：「無論如何要把製造「重水」的設備和已經製成的「重水」毀滅，決不能讓它們出境。</p>
<p>當時留在挪威的特種部隊，已祇剩五人，但是工作照樣要進行。同時德方的防禦情形也愈來愈嚴密，鐵路綫一帶，差不多是五步一人，十步一崗。但是不知什麼道理，在運輸這批重要貨物的輸船上，倒沒有派崗位，眞是所謂「天命難違」，叫人無話可說！盟國的特種部隊就找到了這個虛隙，乘水手們在船艙中玩撲克的時候，安放了定時炸彈，等到輪船駛出港口若千里之後，轟然爆炸，結果三千六百加侖「重水」和全部機械統統葬身海底。</p>
<p>「德國爲什麼沒有原子炸彈？」上面一段故事，說明了許多原因中的一個原因。</p>
<h3>珍聞　人頭的買賣</h3>
<p>當筆者旅居於南美洲赤道國基多地方時，有一天夜裏在旅館裏從睡夢中醒來，突然瞥見一個人握着一顆女子的頭顱，放在我的面前，同時聽到一種粗糙的聲音竊竊私語道：「先生！先生！只有五十元，很便宜的！」你可以想像得到我那時的吃驚是非同小可的。</p>
<p>那顆人頭的確是一個年輕女子的，看了它的又黑又長的美髮便可以斷定的。那裏的印第安土著慣常把人頭抽去骨骼，縮小到四分之一，當做一種商品，賣給白種人。南美洲多的是神秘的事情，而這個「縮頭」的玩意兒更是神秘中的神秘！</p>
<h3>舊心換新心</h3>
<p>最近有一位蘇聯科學家試驗「移心術」已經得到了成功。這個消息震驚了全世界的醫藥界。最近莫斯科高爾基實驗醫學研究院裏的科學家辛尼津博士試驗「移心術」成功，更加引起醫藥界的注意。辛氏用蛙作試驗，因爲蛙的心臟最簡單。</p>
<p>辛氏用蛙試驗成功以後，進一步試驗貓·狗·兔等熱血動物，這些動物的心臟和人類的心臟頗爲近似。辛氏的計劃擬製成供人類應用的代用心臟，預備在原來的心臟衰弱時，將第二顆更强的心臟接上去，最後的目標便是欲達到心臟移接術，他把心臟接在外面，等到發生良好的作用以後，然後把原來的心臟移去。這件事的成功尙須俟諸異日，但成功的希望是很大的。果然，則人類的壽命當可延長不少。</p>
<h3>梵蒂岡與克林姆宮　已至短兵相接地步</h3>
<p>— 溪節譯新聞週刋</p>
<p>歐洲曾經是天主敎的世界，可是目前歐洲人所追求的不是理想，而是現實。隨着戰事的結束，梵諦岡面臨到歷史上最嚴重的一個問題。敎宗庇護十二世眼看着幾百萬的飢民快要給蘇聯的侵入勢力所吞噬，不覺憂心忡忡，日甚一日。現在已經到了宗敎和政治短兵相接的時期了。羅馬敎廷的勢力，已經開始伸張到政治的旋渦中了。</p>
<p>敎宗庇護十二世在過去一年中，曾發表過二十五次以上的演說，籲請全世界三萬三千八百萬天主敎徒堅定信念，團結一致，與共產主義國家的唯物主義和現世主義作殊死戰。五月十二日敎宗曾對四萬餘義大利女子發表演說，涉及六月二日義大利選舉事，促請她們選舉確能尊重上帝及宗敎的候選人，而不要選舉左派的人士。兩天以後，紐約共產黨機關報「每日工人」即爲文指謫敎宗的參加義大利選舉運動。</p>
<p>天主敎與共產主義的衝突由來已久，不過時至今日更趨於尖銳化而已。在最近一年中，梵諦岡和克林姆宮雙方，在每次發動新戰略時，曾屢次反脣相譏，鋒鋩畢露。去年十二月敎宗宣佈從世界各國選任樞機主敎三十二人，聲言敎會應該是超國界的，不應該再由義大利民族單獨主持。蘇聯的「消息報」立即爲文攻訐，指選任樞機主敎一舉爲梵諦岡企圖散佈「反動」勢力至世界各國的一種行動，想藉此提高羅馬敎廷在民主國家的威望。</p>
<p>羅馬敎宗庇護十二世已届古稀年齡，生平對於共產主義素所憎惡。當他旅居德國十二年中，對於共產主義反對甚力，一度遭紅軍暗殺未成。最近敎宗對法朗哥政府抱寬容態度，乃因西班牙政府准許人民有宗敎自由之故。敎會中人深覺法朗哥倘於此時下野，將引起西班牙內亂，而內亂適足以造就共產黨的機會。</p>

<h3>臨城歷險記</h3>
<p>— 樵子</p>
<p>臨城被中共（新四軍）包圍了八個月，這中共部隊十二萬人的猛烈攻擊，不但沒有得到優勢，反而犧牲了兩萬多人；繼臨城後突攻棗莊，目的是消滅臨城的崎角，陷於孤立後再施行各個擊破的慣技，殊知同樣的碰了一個硬釘子，只得收集殘敗人馬將臨棗團團圍困，在這時我往返臨城徐州間已是三進三出，每次都被三番兩次的檢査，並且受了很多不好聽的言語和精神上的侮辱！在他們的和平區裏惟有忍氣呑聲多陪一點笑臉，不然你休想通行。</p>
<p>這次我們編遣下來，因情況比從前緊張，運糧曾二三度不准，所以我們許多伙伴都不敢走，等侯機會再說，我不管三七念一同了兩位伙伴冒險通行，做來者的先鋒。</p>
<p>五月卅一日晨六時由臨城出發，雇一個老百姓挑行李，走稽莊是兩條路，我走鐵道附近公路，他倆走鄕村大道，不及三里就發現有一個土八路帶，他們進村子裏去很久沒有出來，我就知道大事不好。恐懼也沒有用，便跑到村子附近問問其他的人，說在裏面檢査。我到裏面就禁閉在一間小屋裏（各別扣押互不見面）在屋裏我悶得慌！但不時偸眼看看外面有無變動，好作最後準備；忽然來了一位橫眉怒目身掛駁壳槍武裝不整的人，問我到那裏去，是否有公事，我說是編餘軍官由臨城到徐州，公事是師部的差假證。他又要復員與退役證，並說公事不能通過和平區，三人小組公事亦不生效，怎麽辦呢？那時推測不出他是何用心，他又同我談了許多「民主」國共如何。……蔣毛如何……簡直是荒謬絕倫大賣其冒牌同仁堂的狗皮膏！並勸我不必回家，就在那裏幹也是一樣，經我再三聲明不幹軍人回家當老百姓去，始憤恨而去！</p>
<p>不久又另來了一個人也談了一大套哲理，接二連三的還是那套把戲，我和有一位姓曹的談得滿不錯，爲了要好起見，他問我要了一雙皮鞋，不一時其他的人知道都來要，只得忍痛犧牲，於是水筆手錶毛巾保險刀襯衫短褲等霎時非我所有了！他們喁喁私語一陣對我說，八路軍不要東西，非給錢不可，最後得到了數千元的代價了事。</p>
<p>他們突然把我兩位伙伴帶來了，把行李弄得烏七八糟的，命令我們捆好送到沙溝區部裏，不知又有甚麼新花樣，數分鐘後我們在唱「男起解」了！到區部仍像從前一樣如法泡製，來一套戲法，那時我們飢　在鼓勵，又見天快黑了，心裏急得十三萬分，大有「黃泉無客店，今夜宿誰家，」之感。</p>
<p>不久李區長回來又把我們詳細問了一番，准許過去，令在前面村十去宿一宵，便千恩萬謝出來，仍囑雇伕將行李挑着走，在路上又遇到了一批一批荷槍的土八路，我們說由區部來到前面村子去，幸而沒要買路錢，不然軍服被子又不保險了！</p>
<p>到村子的時候，便同村長商談與哀求之下，允許在一間四面通空氣的茅屋下駐宿，並買幾個　一盌小米粥充飢，翌晨東方微明卽催起身，屬伕要我們橫渡微山湖而到利國驛，該處無國共軍的檢査，但我怕上「水泊梁山」遇到混江龍李俊請吃餛飩與板刀麵，丟行李事小，性命有虧，所以不敢嘗試，仍決心走公路，到韓荘通過了三次步哨，到最後的警戒綫想該可以過去，殊知走來十幾個流寇式的便衣武裝同志，機槍駁壳槍步槍馬刀長矛各色俱備，吆喝着問明了來意後卽檢査行李，就把我們押到營部去，過來兩個武裝兵把我們分別扣押，於是又作階下囚！不到念分鐘，又另換押一個地方，如此十餘次，眞弄得天旋地轉啼笑皆非，在這時不斷有人來游說，但均置之不聞，在提心吊膽的當中受了一夜洋罪！</p>
<p>次日提我出去審問，問的人大約是一個指導員，經了一點多鐘，又問是否　蔣主席的學生，我對以行伍出身甚麽都不懂，可是他忽然莊嚴起來說，你的伙伴太對不起朋友，爲甚麼偸走會議紀錄！把國特的罪名加到頭上來了，要我馬上實說，不然就用最嚴厲手段對付，押去「開火花」。我聽了這話，猶如冷水澆頭，誰人吃得消，便詳細由臨城出發經過沙溝的情形說了又說，他始半信半疑仍令還押，在這時我心裏免不了忐忑的跳，抗戰八年沒有給鬼子打死，現在死在八路手裏未免太寃枉了！到這時又有甚麽辦法呢？只有聽憑命運的支配吧。經過三小時的綜雜思想，仍無法解決來安慰自己，同時也就把生命置之度外，殺剮聽便。</p>
<p>這時來了一位同志很和氣的請我到外面說話，即跟他來到辦公室，一眼看見我的伙伴坐在那裏很安閑的在抽烟，於是心裏放下一塊大石，經我問其原因，在稽莊被土八路檢査行李時，無意把紀錄丟在裏面，匆忙間不及詳査，以致遭這兩天之危！幸而他們打電話問得很淸楚，不然恐怕已回姥姥家裏過端午節去了！大約又一小時許，審問的指導員帶了十幾個同志出來連說對不起！麻煩，麻煩，坐下來又扯了很久的天，無外乎是灌鹼政治作用，然後纔把我們送到營門。吿辭，那時我們揑了一把汗，很匆忙的走過架在運河上的木橋，進入我們的警戒內，我同伙伴不禁歡躍狂呼跳起來足有八丈高，喜得掉下淚來，喂，脫臉了！重新回到我們安全的懷抱裏。</p>
<h3>我看到了蔣緯國</h3>
<p>— 鮑鐘祺</p>
<p>常常在報紙上看到蔣緯國少校的名字，在印緬等地激戰的時侯，他的聲譽更大。勝利後，他就率領了部隊移駐上海，暫時駐紥在楊樹浦滬江大學原址，同學們都希望能够一睹這少年英雄的廬山眞面目。</p>
<p>終於蔣緯國夫婦於六月三日來參加滬江大學的週會了，在輕快的進行曲節奏下，他同夫人步入了禮堂，坐在台下的第一排。</p>
<p>當凌校長請他上來演講的時侯，在同學們熱烈的鼓掌聲中，他從椅子上站了起來，但是因爲兩邊通台上的門都沒有開，使得他左右爲難。事後，他自己說：「我還以爲凌校長要試試我看，讓我爬上台來呢！」</p>
<p>的確，蔣緯國少校的爲人很風趣，他上台後就先自我介紹：「我姓蔣，名緯國，經緯的緯，國家的國，是中國裝甲兵敎導總隊第一隊團附少校。」直爽而不驕傲，淸脆流利的國語更使同學們欽佩。</p>
<p>接著，他以軍人的資格，向我們介紹一些新的軍事知識，他對於坦克車名稱的來源，裝甲兵訓練的槪況，和新疆的伊寗事件都有很詳盡的說明。</p>
<p>當他在說中國亟需訓練裝甲兵人才時，立刻回頭向凌校長解釋：「請你原諒，我並不是在宣傳拉生意。」座下哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>散會後，同學們都戀戀不捨地跟着他們，尤其是蔣緯國夫人，更成爲女同學們視綫的焦點。她含笑地點首致謝。據說，等同學們從宿舍中拿了照相機趕來，他們已經上車回去了，眞是非常可惜呢！</p>

<h3>「英國大便」　「美國撤嬌」</h3>
<p>— 馮憶</p>
<p>由於在在報紙上看到「手民之誤」，想起舊事數則。戰前廣州某報，記英國大使抵漢口消息一則，大號字標題「英國大使抵漢」，誤排爲「英國大便抵漢」，見者愕然，亦「手民之誤」之奇巧者。</p>
<p>太平洋戰事前夕，美國尙無對日作戰決心，而頻頻對日施行壓力，一度曾經發出撤退駐日美僑之命令。香港某報將小標題「美國撤僑」，誤排潤，「美國撤嬌」，錯得頗有風　，蓋當時之「撤　」，實亦有外交姿態之「撤僑」意味也。</p>
<p>一九四三年，香港立報由葉靈鳳主福「言林」編務，當時有附逆文人表示悔悟，葉在「言林」作一短文，謂如此人眞的能够悔過自新，吾人自當不咎旣往，張臂以歡迎之句，手民將一「臂」字誤植爲「臀」字，一時哄傅某人「張臀以迎」，是則諸而又近於虛矣。</p>

<h3>論「紫鵑」</h3>
<p>— 曹作漢</p>
<p>曾有紅樓迷者，將薛寳釵擬爲曾國藩，把林黛玉比做左宗棠。並有好事的無聊文人擬將薛大妹子捧做文正公夫人；此眞是多事之想。夫異性相吸，同性相拒，非僅合乎物理，亦且同於人情，性格相同的豈必定可結合，境遇相同的，亦未必能够相憐相親，祗緣份屬佳人，始多此非非之怨。我以爲紅樓夢中有一小妮子，的確可以醉人心魄，令人景行仰止，她，就是紫鵑。</p>
<p>如也加以比擬的話，我說：他，很像武侯諸葛亮。</p>
<p>說來他原是賈府上的丫頭，後來才做了林妹妹的侍婢，這也是遵從賈母的安排囑咐，忠心耿耿的一心一意以效忠貞，雖然她沒有武侯的才能去南征北討的「鞠躬盡瘁」，但試探說謊，受了埋怨反忘了自己的存在，象憂亦憂，象喜亦喜，直至「苦綘珠魂歸離恨天」，終於鉸了三千靑絲去隨驚四姑娘出家，這在她總算盡了「死而後已」的懷抱了。若換了別個，趁着寳二爺戀舊情懷，可不早就爬上高枝上兒去；祗有諸葛亮，才會對扶不起的阿斗效忠到死。</p>
<p>或日：「道失求諸野」。祗緣賈府上祗有一對石獅子是　淨，所以才顯得她的高潔，話確不錯，像現在所謂大家閨秀者，骨頭輕得也許不及戰前的書史，反是小戶女子，沒有什麼大學問，還不曾忘記了全部的節義道理。</p>
<p>然而：在現在，像紫鵑這樣性型的人還有麽？如果有的話，雖執鞭之士，余亦願爲之。</p>

<h3>不怕雨水的瀝青</h3>
<p>— 易</p>
<p>化學家新近發見一種物質，能使熱的地瀝靑粘着在濕的表面上。地瀝靑本來遇着水就失去粘着力但是經過這一種物質處理以後，就能和沙礫堅牢地粘合起來，所以縱使下着大雨的時候，也可以用這種混合物來鋪築路面。往常，修築馬路遇着雨天，就沒有辦法。因為築路材料如果是潮濕的，粘合力，就大爲減弱，用濕材料鋪築的路面，很容易破裂和剝落。因此，逢到雨天，築路只好停頓，等天氣轉晴時再行繼續。</p>
<p>這新物質是一種液體，可以在提煉地瀝靑時加入小量，或者在應用時加入亦可。有了這種物質，不但新築的路面可以不受風雨的影響，而且免得因等待晴天而躭誤工作和增加費用，對於路政上是個不小的貢獻。</p>

<h3>The Overall Situation Still Needs Effort; Transportation Restoration Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] According to reliable sources, regarding the CCP issue, the government will not accept any conditions from the CCP beyond the three points stated on June 6th: (1) Complete cessation of conflict in the Northeast, (2) Complete restoration of domestic transportation, and (3) Prompt implementation of the agreement on nationwide demobilization, reorganization, and unification of troops. In fact, the CCP has not presented any conditions to date. Furthermore, representatives of the China Youth Party and the Democratic League, such as Zhang Junmai, have not advocated for extending the 15-day ceasefire period by any amount of time, nor have they put forward any conditions as intermediaries.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Pre-conference activities for the Military Three-Person Council are still ongoing today, solely involving individual exchanges of opinions. It is said that a meeting may be held within the next few days. Regarding the negotiations for restoring transportation, Colonel Moore, the transportation advisor to General Marshall and the chief of the Railway Management Section of the Field Headquarters, continued discussions on the 11th with our Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei and CCP representative Zhou Enlai. It is said that these negotiations have progressed to the point where both sides have presented concrete proposals. Once the meeting is successful, transportation executive groups may be dispatched rapidly to the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) and Jiaoji (Jiaozhou-Jinan) lines to oversee the restoration of the railways. According to sources close to General Marshall, he hopes that both sides can quickly narrow the distance in their opinions on reopening the Military Three-Person Council and transportation negotiations. Observing the current situation, if the CCP can reflect in a timely manner and refrain from creating further complications, and can promptly dispatch ceasefire and transportation executive groups to Qingdao, Jinan, Tai'an, and Dezhou to extinguish the rekindled flames of war, it will be beneficial to peace negotiations.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Beiping, 11th] Today, according to a dispatch from the Central News Agency's Shenyang correspondent: General Marshall will soon visit Changchun. However, this news has not been confirmed by other sources.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Representatives of the Democratic League and the Political Consultative Conference, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, and Shen Junqiao, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. Liang Shuming will also arrive here in the coming days. According to Huang Yanpei, after exchanging views with various parties in Nanjing, the representatives of the Democratic League believe that considerable effort is still needed for the overall situation to develop. If the 15-day ceasefire talks do not reach a complete resolution, it would be worthwhile to extend the time, so that the limited ceasefire can be transformed into unlimited peace. At the same time, it is hoped that the Three-Person Group can quickly resolve the superficial military problems and then move on to resolving the fundamental political problems. They met with General Marshall in Nanjing and found his words to be most appropriate: "To be open and honest about the current situation, the third party must make efforts between the KMT and the CCP." Huang also revealed that representatives from the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and prominent figures will continue discussions in Nanjing on the 16th. At that time, they may issue a comprehensive opinion on the current situation. Recently, there will also be an informal discussion in Shanghai first. According to Chang Yansheng, a Youth Party representative to the Political Consultative Conference, after discussions with representatives from various parties in Nanjing, opinions have become more aligned, hoping that the overall situation can maintain peaceful development and that the KMT and the CCP can reach an understanding. Furthermore, Li Huang, a standing committee member of the party, was still in Nanjing yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Lafa Was Unclear Yesterday; Shenyang Dispatched Planes for Reconnaissance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 11th] Lafa, which is on the same line as Changchun and Yongji and is also a transportation hub, is in an unknown situation after being fiercely attacked by the Communist forces. Shenyang dispatched planes for reconnaissance but failed to make contact with the defending troops. Another report states that Lafa has been captured by the Communist forces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun, 11th] The Communist forces, commanded by Lin Biao, launched several fierce attacks on Lafa on the 9th with their First Division and an independent brigade, but were repelled by the National Army. On the 10th, the Communist forces successively increased their strength to 22 regiments (including one artillery regiment) and launched another fierce attack on Lafa and the areas west of it, including Big and Small Gujia Mountain and Guan Laoye Ridge. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun, 10th] The Communist forces, commanded by Lin Biao's First Division and an independent brigade, launched an all-out attack on the National Army in Lafa on the 9th. After engaging in bayonet combat, the Communist forces were repelled. The National Army suffered more than 140 casualties. On the 10th, the Communist forces continued to launch fierce attacks on the National Army. The National Army in the areas west of Lafa, including Big and Small Gujiazi and the 769 Heights southeast of Laoye Ridge, is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist forces. According to captured Communist soldiers, the Communist forces are determined to first occupy Lafa Laoye Ridge and then attempt to seize Yongji. The area near Lafa has been set ablaze by the Communist forces, with flames filling the sky. The Communist forces have now added 21 infantry regiments and one artillery regiment. The National Army at Old Station, 10 kilometers south of Lafa, has been forced to withdraw after being fiercely attacked by the Communist forces. Four days after the ceasefire order was issued, the Communist forces continue to disregard faith and create this unfortunate incident.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] According to Communist soldiers captured in Lafa on the night of the 9th, Lin Biao personally led the First Division, attached with more than 20 artillery pieces, to attack the front of the National Army in Lafa. The Second Division attacked the flanks of the National Army in Lafa. Another Communist garrison battalion attacked the National Army in Laoye Ridge, attempting to disrupt the transportation on the Laji Line.</p>
<h3>The Military Mediation Department Neglected, Bai Lude Flies Back to Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 11th] The government side of the Military Mediation Department has protested to the CCP regarding the large-scale offensive launched by the Communist forces in Shandong and other places, as well as the successive captures of various locations. It has also telegraphed the relevant groups to conduct a thorough investigation and report back, centered around the US side. The atmosphere in the department has been quite disharmonious recently. During meetings, extreme views are expressed, or poor attitudes are displayed, leading to unpleasant endings. Bao Shilin, the CCP's executive director, left the Executive Headquarters four days ago and returned to Linyi, Shandong. It is said that he is one of those who left because he was not suited for this kind of work. His position has been temporarily filled by Chen Shiqu. Luo Ruiqing, the Communist Chief of Staff, has not been to the Military Mediation Department for several days. Therefore, despite the frequent occurrence of military conflicts in various places, the Military Mediation Department has become neglected. One responsible person even stated: "If this continues, the Military Mediation Department will close its doors when the 15-day negotiation period expires." All of this makes people feel the difficulties ahead. However, the staff sent by the government to Changchun in preparation for mediating the Changchun branch of the Military Mediation Department will still dispatch Tang Gongtong, the director of the committee office, tomorrow. Niu Xianming of the headquarters is also preparing to go.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 11th] Bai Lude flew back here this afternoon to treat a dental ailment.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Meeting Approved the Establishment of New Police Agencies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 11th] Two new mechanisms will be established to manage the national ordinary police and traffic police. One is the Police General Administration under the Ministry of Interior, and the other is the Traffic Police General Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation. The Police General Administration will have six divisions responsible for organization, education, training, overseas Chinese leaders, visas, and welfare and pensions. It will also have technical experts to handle specialized techniques such as fingerprinting, photography, gun testing, chemical testing, and identification. In addition, police corps, uniform factories, repair shops, and police radio stations may be established as needed. The Traffic Police General Bureau will manage the protection of traffic safety, the maintenance of traffic order, and the assistance in arresting smugglers and tax evaders. It will have five divisions and command the national railways, highways, waterways, mining areas, and 18 traffic police teams, mobilizing approximately 110,000 police officers. The aforementioned Police General Administration Organization Law and the Traffic Police General Bureau Organization Regulations have both been passed by the 301st meeting of the Legislative Yuan. They will be formally established once the National Government issues an official announcement.</p>

<h3>Ge Jingen's Remarks: No Bureaucratic Capital Found in Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Ge Jingen told our reporter on the 11th: The transportation to and from Taiwan Province still needs to be strengthened. It is hoped that the convenience of transportation will promote the economic revival and cultural progress of Taiwan Province, so as to reduce the estrangement of foreigners from Taiwan. The various enemy properties and enterprises received in Taiwan Province, those that benefit national defense and those that cannot make a profit, are now state-owned. Other profitable enterprises will be encouraged to be privately operated as much as possible. As for bureaucratic capital, it has not yet been discovered in Taiwan Province.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 11th] The Central Propaganda Department invited reporters at 3:00 PM on the 11th and asked Ge Jingen, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Administrative Chief Executive Office, Yan Jiagan, Director of the Office, and Wu Tao, Director of the Bureau, to report on the recent situation in Taiwan. Peng Xuepei, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and Xu Xiaoyan, Deputy Minister, attended and presided over the meeting.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Communist Army's Attacks and Road Destruction After Noon on the 7th of This Month; Officially Announced Yesterday by the Spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 11th] The spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense issued a statement on the 11th, stating that peace, unity, and national construction are the government's consistent aims. Since the government issued orders on January 10th of this year to cease conflicts and restore transportation, the National Army has strictly obeyed the orders and faithfully implemented them. However, the Communist forces in various places have not complied with mediation, launched widespread offensives, attacked the National Army, and expanded their territory. At the same time, they have wantonly propagated and blamed the government in an attempt to shift responsibility. The National Army's entry into the Northeast to restore sovereignty is not subject to any restrictions, which was agreed and signed by the CCP. However, the Communist forces initially took the opportunity to assemble their troops and occupy various coastal ports and overland transportation routes from the customs areas. Subsequently, they wanted to occupy Sipingjie, Changchun, Harbin, and many other important towns and cities that the government had already sent personnel to receive. In order to restore sovereignty in the Northeast, the National Army overcame all difficulties and obstacles. After recovering Sipingjie and Changchun, it would not have been difficult to go directly north and complete its mission. However, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was concerned about the past fourteen years of suffering of the Northeastern compatriots under the enemy and puppet's iron hooves, and could not bear to inflict war again. Therefore, he formally announced an order to cease military action on the 6th of this month, giving the CCP another opportunity to fulfill the agreement, which was also agreed to by the CCP representatives. The actions of the Communist forces after the 7th of this month did not diminish at all due to the ceasefire order. In order to make the whole country understand the truth and urge the Communist forces to wake up, the following is a list of the facts of the Communist forces' attacks on the National Army and destruction of transportation since 12:00 noon on the 7th of this month: Northeast: The National Army obeyed Chairman Chiang's order and completely stopped pursuing, advancing, and attacking from noon on the 7th. However, the Communist forces did not abide by faith and took this opportunity to use the railway to simultaneously increase troops in the north and south. Three hours after the ceasefire order in the Northeast took effect, they launched fierce offensives against the National Army's positions, including: (1) The National Army in Lafa, east of Yongji, was surrounded and fiercely attacked on the evening of the 7th by the Communist First Division and the Seventh Column of the Jilin Military Region, which had sneaked in from the Gangdun Railway. As of the 10th, its strength had increased to 22 regiments, and fierce fighting was still ongoing. A 3-kilometer tunnel in Laoye Ridge was destroyed by the Communist forces. (2) At 3:00 PM on the 7th, the Communist forces launched a fierce attack on the National Army between Yushu County, Wukeshu, and approximately 20 kilometers southeast of Taolaizhao. Communist forces near Taolaizhao also attacked the National Army at the same time. (3) The 21st Brigade of the Communist forces near Falahai, 30 kilometers northwest of Nongan, launched a fierce attack on the National Army starting at 3:00 PM on the 7th. By 8:00 PM, the Communist forces had increased by more than 1,000 and continued the attack. (4) The Weijin River Estuary railway bridge south of Andong was destroyed by the Communist forces on the evening of the 8th. (5) On the evening of the 8th, the Communist forces attacked the National Army in Wuchengzi and Qianhou Mafeng Mountain, southeast of Haicheng, from Shahezi. They were repelled by the National Army on the evening of the 9th. In the above-mentioned areas, the National Army was attacked by the Communist forces, but in order to strictly abide by orders and respect faith, it only took self-defense measures in its positions and did not counterattack. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Dezhou Falls, Street Fighting in Tai'an; Outskirts of Jinan War Spreads; Communist Forces in Southern Shandong Advancing Towards Xuzhou</h3>

After being attacked by a Communist regiment for four days, the defending troops in Dezhou suffered considerable casualties due to the disparity in numbers, and the situation is very critical. According to airline pilots carrying food and medicine to Tai'an and Dezhou for delivery, the people inside and outside the two cities are being killed by stray bullets and starvation, lying dead on the streets, which is clearly visible. Moreover, many children's corpses were seen, which was extremely tragic.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 11th] The Communist forces in northern Jiangsu are currently being transferred to southern Shandong to reinforce the area due to the fierce fighting in southern Shandong.

<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 10th] The war situation in various parts of Shandong on the 10th remained intense.

The National Army in Dakouwen only occupies a small stronghold, and the situation is critical. (3) On the 10th at noon, two Communist aircraft dropped two bombs on the south gate of Dezhou, completely destroying the airport.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Qingdao, 11th] The Communist forces attacked Qingdao City with a regiment. After the garrison stationed on the outskirts of the city bravely fought back, the original defense lines from nine days ago were restored on the morning of the 11th. All sectors of Qingdao City expressed their appreciation for the merits of the defending troops and launched a comfort campaign, raising more than 10 million yuan in donations and a large amount of treasures to be sent to the Xiazhuang area.</p>
<h3>Communication With Small Groups in Shandong and Southern Hebei War Zones Is Interrupted</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Beiping, 11th] All communication between the American representatives of the Executive Headquarters and the American personnel of the five executive groups currently in the Shandong and Southern Hebei war zones has been interrupted. The five groups are stationed in Tai'an, Zaozhuang, Gaomi, Dezhou, and Yongnian, namely Groups 16, 22, 15, 21, and 31. The actual situation of the American personnel in each of these groups is unknown, but their radio communications have indeed lost contact with the headquarters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping, 11th] According to sources, the Communist forces in Shandong launched a large-scale offensive against Dezhou on the evening of the 7th. The National Army was trapped for four days, ran out of ammunition and food, and was finally captured by the Communist forces on the evening of the 10th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Zhengzhou, 10th] On the 9th, the Communist forces concentrated more than 10,000 troops near the Caoxian Railway Station and along the Longhai Railway in the Mincheng area, presenting a tense situation.</p>

<h3>Mongolian Banner Delegation Arrives in Beiping; Will Fly to Nanjing to Pay Respects to the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 11th] Most members of the Mongolian Banner delegation celebrating victory and returning to the capital have already flown to Beiping on the 6th and 8th. They will soon fly to Nanjing to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The delegation consists of Mongolian Banner personnel who participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, totaling ten members.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 11th] After the Mongolian Banner delegation arrived in Beiping, the delegation leader, Rong Xiang, the Mongolian Pacification Commissioner, Ba Wenjun, Secretary-General of the Mongolian Affairs Committee, and Committee Member Hu Fengshan had a long conversation with our reporter for two hours. They unanimously believed: (1) The resolutions on the frontier areas passed by the 19th meeting of the Second Plenary Session are extremely reasonable. The people of the frontier areas are excited by the news and deeply hope that the resolutions can be implemented as soon as possible. (2) The Mongolian Autonomous Political Affairs Committee should be restored as soon as possible, so that Inner Mongolia, where the internal and external situations are unusually complex, can obtain unified leadership as soon as possible. (3) The powers and responsibilities of the banner and the county should be clearly defined. (4) The government should be lenient towards the Mongolian youths who were coerced into participating in the puppet organizations in the past. However, traitors who willingly submitted to the enemy are absolutely not qualified to participate in the Mongolian political institutions after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. (5) The Mongolian areas that were occupied suffered extremely severely during the War of Resistance, and it is hoped that the Executive Yuan will provide effective relief.</p>
<h3>Revised Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Will Be Implemented Starting July 1st</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 11th] The revised financial revenue and expenditure system will be officially implemented starting on July 1st of this year. The implementation association for the revised financial revenue and expenditure system has already approved various related implementation measures. The revised financial revenue and expenditure system is divided into three levels: (1) central, (2) provincial and municipal, and (3) county (establishment bureau administration) and provincial cities, townships and towns finances, shall be separately budgeted and included in the county (bureau) city general budget. The financial revenue and expenditure of provinces and municipalities directly under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan will be directly supervised by the central administrative, legislative, and supervisory authorities before autonomy is achieved, and will be directly supervised by the provincial and municipal council after autonomy is achieved, and indirectly supervised by the central authorities. The financial revenue and expenditure of counties (bureaus) cities will be directly supervised by the province before autonomy is achieved, and will be directly supervised by the county (bureau) city council after autonomy is achieved, and indirectly supervised by the province.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 11th] The meeting to implement the revised financial revenue and expenditure system passed a suggestion on tightening the provincial and county institutions on the 10th. The methods are: (1) If the machinery originally established at all levels of provinces (cities) counties (cities) has overlapping business or is not necessary in fact, the provinces and cities may consider their financial resources and cut and merge them. (2) If the central government later orders provincial and municipal governments to handle business, they should be asked to use the original institutions and not set up new ones. (3) For matters entrusted by the Central Government in the future, the entrusting agency should be asked to issue funds, and if there are matters such as requisitioning labor and purchasing goods, they should also be issued on time and in full according to the local market price, so as to avoid differential assignments and causing unfair apportionment and harassment. The meeting also passed that special institutions established by the central government in various provinces, counties and cities are not legally based, duplicated or unnecessary in fact, and should be negotiated by the central provincial city and county authorities to cut and merge.</p>

<h3>National Army Strictly Observes Ceasefire Order, Hopes the Communist Party Sincerely Reflects, Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Peng Xuepei, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, answered inquiries from our newspaper reporter alone at 4:40 PM on the 11th. (1) Asked whether the recent talks on a ceasefire mediated by Special Envoy Marshall had yielded any results? Answered that opinions were still being exchanged. (2) Asked whether it was possible to hold a meeting of the Military Three-Person Committee soon? Answered that it could be held at any time after the two sides' opinions approached each other. (3) Asked what countermeasures the government would take against the Communist army's blatant violation of the 15-day ceasefire agreement in various places inside and outside the customs? Answered that the government adheres to its ceasefire promises, and the national army strictly obeys the ceasefire order. This is a fact recognized worldwide, but the government cannot stand idly by while people are dying, and the national army cannot abandon its duty to maintain law and order and protect the people. If the Communist army disturbs the local area or attacks the national army, the local national army will naturally fight back for self-defense. However, the national army only takes it as its duty to repel the invading Communist army and does not pursue it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th Dispatch] Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Peng Xuepei, briefly addressed a press conference on the 12th, stating: Chairman Chiang has already announced a 15-day cessation of military action in the Northeast, allowing the Communist Party to show sincerity and quickly resolve the pressing issues of stopping the conflict, restoring transportation, and reorganizing and unifying troops. The Chairman sincerely hopes that the negotiations will yield results to relieve the people from their suffering. He hopes that the news media will work together, understanding the Chairman's painstaking efforts to seek peace through compromise, and move towards this goal together. All unconfirmed news and indiscriminate criticisms must be carefully and resolutely eliminated. In particular, newspapers related to the government should pay special attention. Even if the Communist Party makes excessive remarks, they must be very patient and not respond with harsh words. However, the Propaganda Department certainly cannot prohibit the reporting of facts. For example, the Communist army fiercely attacked Dezhou on the 8th and blew up the Hanzhuang Bridge on the 9th. These are facts. During this period when both sides had ordered a cessation of military action, the Communist army launched a large-scale offensive in Shandong, delivering a head-on blow to the peace talks. This is what we feel most pained about. Under these circumstances, the government is truly in a very difficult position. Can the government sit idly by and not provide assistance? Can negotiations have results in this way? We hope that the Communist army will sincerely reflect and not cease fire in the Northeast while starting a war in Shandong, causing the people to suffer sacrifices and friendly nations to feel disappointed. This is our sincere hope.</p>

<h3>Reasons for Allowing Foreign Ships to Enter Inner Ports: Encourage Exports and Reduce Freight, Peng Xuepei Hopes Shipping Companies Will Overcome Difficulties Together</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Peng Xuepei, stated when receiving reporters on the afternoon of the 11th that recently the government has specially allowed foreign ships to load and unload direct import and export goods in the four ports of Hankou, Jiujiang, Gulou, and Nanjing, for a period of one year. They are only allowed to load export goods that are directly exported abroad, or import goods that come directly from foreign countries. They are not allowed to load and unload goods within China that are transported from Port A to Port B. This measure has been passed through a solemn and legal procedure and has been implemented. Some domestic shipping companies seem to have some doubts about this, and I would like to add a few words of explanation. There are two reasons why the government has adopted this measure: (1) At present, our people are absorbing a large amount of import goods like thirsty people drink, and as such, we must further encourage exports to balance it out, otherwise, our country's economy and currency system will be greatly threatened. However, our domestic river vessels are lacking, and it is quite difficult to transport goods from various inland river ports to the seaport. The exorbitant inland river freight rates are proof of the extreme shortage of ships. The Swedish Minister said that the freight rate from Sweden to Wusong is lower than the freight rate from Wusong to the Shanghai Bund Wharf. This is a fact. Because barges are lacking, and everything relies on manual labor, and there is a lack of mechanical equipment, the cost of each transfer is extremely high. This cost is a major blow to export goods in particular. Also, the transportation of some export goods requires special equipment. For example, if eggs shipped from Hankou to the UK need to be transferred in Shanghai, not only will the freight increase, but damage is also a concern. Flexible measures should be taken to increase the volume of transportation and reduce freight and losses. (2) At present, Shanghai is crowded with goods, and warehouse space is extremely difficult to find. Ships arriving at the port often cannot find a pier position, and even the mooring buoys are not enough. Foreign ships often dock outside the Wusong Estuary, waiting for space for several weeks. If some ships can directly sail to the inner port, this can also reduce such delays. This measure is an emergency measure during the recovery period and is only valid for one year. The government is doing its utmost to protect and encourage the domestic shipping industry and is constantly considering it. Shipping industry colleagues, please rest assured that the government must weigh the pros and cons in order to save the current emergency situation. In urgent situations, we must treat the symptoms first. I hope everyone will understand the difficulties of the times and overcome them together.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Starting from the "Western European Bloc"</h3>
<p>Recently, general elections were held in France and Italy, and the Catholic parties won great victories. As a result of the French general election, the Popular Republican Movement, led by Foreign Minister Bidault, that is, the progressive Catholic Party, gained an absolute advantage in the new Constituent Assembly, leaping to become the number one party in France today. At the same time, the momentum of the Communist Party has sharply decreased and it can no longer control the French political situation. The same is true in Italy. In the Dutch general election, the Catholic Party also became the number one party in the country. These signs have led some people to believe that the mainland of Western Europe seems to be becoming the world of conservative forces. Except for Spain and Portugal, which are ruled by Catholic totalitarian regimes, the rest are all influenced by democratic, gradualist, right-wing Catholic parties. A London political observer once said: The famous "Western European Bloc" seems to be gradually becoming a reality, but its center is not in socialist Britain but in the Vatican. Including France and Italy, the sphere of influence of Catholic parties will include the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, and parts of southern Germany. This is indeed a trend worthy of attention by the world.</p>
<p>The rise of Catholic parties in France, Italy, and other Western European countries this time probably indicates, on the other hand, the loss of sympathy for the Communist Party. After the long suffering of the war, the Communist Party originally wanted to take the opportunity to seize power, but the will of the people resolutely rejected it. Democracy, after all, triumphed over dictatorship. The instruction given to us by the elections in France and Italy this time is that in a democratic country, the people clearly reject the Communist Party, which shows that there are indeed some differences between democracy and communism. As long as there is true democracy, the Communist Party's dictatorial and autocratic methods will not be able to stand, and no one can use the beautiful name of democracy to support the Communist Party. The Communist Party's consistent style is to bluff and intimidate, using a minority to control the majority and seize power. After the defeat of Germany, the Communist Party's momentum in France and Italy could not be said to be weak at first, but the will of the people cannot be deceived; the Communist Parties of the two countries were finally rejected by the people. China is now embarking on the path of democracy, and there is no concrete way to express public opinion yet. However, the people's general feelings can be said to be wary of the Communist Party. In view of the failure of the Communist Parties in France and Italy, we believe that as long as the government is enlightened and truly implements democratic politics, allowing the Chinese people to vote freely, the party disputes that are not clear in China now can be resolved peacefully, and the Communist Party does not have to dream of spreading the seeds of communism in China.</p>
<p>Since the revolution in France, in the past 150 years or so, the political tides have ebbed and flowed, but they all have a common characteristic, which is opposition to the Catholic Church. Since the Third Republic, the anti-religious wind has become more intense, and the existence of the Catholic Church in France has been frequently attacked by politicians. The state has even promulgated laws to restrict church activities. All of these things have historical and ideological backgrounds. For more than a hundred years, Europe has been shackled by the ideas of the French Revolution, and the result has been the emergence of tyrannical collectivism in Europe, and France itself has been devastated by this tyrannical collectivism. Now that Hitlerism has been defeated, another collectivism is attempting to wield tyranny. What the people need today is stability rather than new experiments. They have freed themselves from the naive ideas of the French Revolution, restored their inherent glorious traditions, and exerted their strength. This is the rise and prevalence of Catholic parties. Moreover, it is worth noting that this trend extends throughout Western Europe, not limited to France. Due to this trend, we feel that the current political situation in our country should not be prolonged any longer. The Chinese people have a peaceful nature and a tradition of moderation, which is really incompatible with the essence and style of the Communist Party, and they may not truly represent the will of the people. Today, the ideals of the Catholic parties that are prevalent in Western Europe are somewhat similar to the Chinese ideal of moderation, and the Three Principles of the People are the crystallization of the ideal of moderation in politics. What we are asking for today is for the Kuomintang to take a breath and earnestly implement the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>The rise of Catholic parties in Western Europe represents a new awakening of the Western European people. They feel that the chaos caused by the Reformation has increased Europe's disturbances and suffering. Only by making politics religious, so that practical politics can practice the ideals of religion, can social order and even international order tend towards stability. This is a trend worthy of our attention. As for what some observers have said, that the famous "Western European Bloc" seems to be gradually becoming a reality, with the Vatican as its center, it is somewhat of an overstatement. The Vatican is the residence of the Catholic Pope, and it itself does not participate in direct politics, it is purely a supra-political religious organization. It is true that Catholic believers regard the Pope as their spiritual leader, but it is clear that the Vatican is the center of the "Western European Bloc". A few days ago, Bishop Cai Ning explained in China that the Pope of the Vatican does not use power to force Catholics to oppose the Communist Party. We also believe that the reduction of the people's confidence in the Communist Party in several Western European countries is one thing, and the religious organization of Catholicism is another. The Vatican exists supra-politically and supra-nationally, and is not related to the formation of the Western European Bloc.</p>
<h3>Local Communications Qinghai Provincial Government Ordered to Build Qingxin Highway Establishment of Engineering Office Headed by Chairman Ma</h3>
<p>Achieving the Goal of Consolidating National Defense and Prospering the Northwest Mobilizing More Than 7,000 Soldiers and Civilians to Complete Within the Year</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qinghai Communication] The Qinghai Provincial Government, under orders to be responsible for the construction of the Qingxin Highway, has specially established the Qingxin Highway Engineering Office, headed by Chairman Ma, to connect the transportation arteries of Qinghai and Xinjiang, with the goal of achieving the objectives of consolidating national defense and prospering the Northwest in the shortest possible time. This road starts from Xining, passes through Huangyuan, Du, Chaidan, the Qaidam Basin, crosses the Arjin Mountains, and reaches Ruoqiang in Xinjiang. All engineers and technicians have been assigned to Qinghai by the Northwest Highway Bureau and started work under the direction of the provincial government last month. Civilian workers are borne by the Mongol and Tibetan people in Huangyuan, Yuan, and near the highway. Because the other counties in the province have been repairing roads and planting trees for years, and other labor services are heavier, they have been temporarily suspended from service. In addition, officers and soldiers of the security cavalry regiment were dispatched from Xining on May 14 to work in front. They also supervise civilian workers to protect public security. This road construction project is extremely difficult, and it is divided into ten general sections and thirty sub-sections, each with a general and sub-section chief to be responsible. It is planned to complete the section from Daotang River to Dosi this year, which will require more than 1,000 soldiers and workers and more than 6,600 civilian workers for a total of five months. By October, due to the cold weather and frozen ground, work can be stopped. Working equipment, food, money, and transportation and accommodation will also be prepared and distributed as required, and construction can begin in June.</p>
<p>Suzhou Improving People's Self-Defense Organization</p>
<p>The county government believes that the cadres of the people's self-defense teams in various rural areas are extremely important. If the candidates are not properly selected, it will easily cause chaos. If they are minor, they will not be able to take responsibility for improving their own organization, and if they are major, they will delay local public security. For the sake of prudence, it is necessary to adjust them. A short-term training class is planned to be held to selectively transfer incumbent cadres of self-defense teams from various places to receive training in order to be competent.</p>
<p>Changshu Extremely Hot Weather Discovers Seasonal Epidemic</p>
<p>The weather is extremely hot, and the room temperature has reached 90 degrees Fahrenheit. True cholera has been discovered in the vicinity of the county seat, and more than 20 people have died. Other rural areas have also discovered it. The county government has organized an epidemic prevention committee and will start to administer vaccinations extensively from the 11th. It has also established a seasonal epidemic hospital, and the public hospital has opened a consultation and treatment center, which opened on the 9th.</p>
<p>Huzhou Large Gang of Bandits Loots Xintang</p>
<p>Robberies have occurred in the counties and towns of Huzhou for days on end, without a day passing without them. The general public is in deep water and fire. Although military and police have pursued and suppressed them, they flee here and there, and their movements are irregular. A large gang of more than 50 bandits was discovered in Xintang Town, Changxing on the 7th. They were fully equipped with machine guns and rifles, and looted shops and homes, causing heavy losses to the people. Those responsible for public security should severely suppress and eliminate them in order to protect local security.</p>

<p>Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting Approaching Soon: Byrnes Flies to Paris Today; Yesterday Explained the Importance of This Meeting to Reporters, Saying Failure Would Be a Failure for All Humanity</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 11th: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes will fly to Paris tomorrow to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Today, he held his last press conference before leaving America. It is said that if this renewed Foreign Ministers' Conference fails again, it will be a failure for all mankind and the four major powers. Byrnes also stated that since the adjournment of the last Foreign Ministers' Conference, no progress has been made on solving the issues.</p>
<p>Byrnes also said: He is not pessimistic about the future of the meeting, but sincerely prays for its success. People of all countries should not compete with each other and treat the meeting like a football game, measuring any progress by the diplomatic victory of one country or another.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes is going to Paris again this week to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Whether the postwar world space is just one or will be divided into two may come to light at this conference. Byrnes has set a deadline for himself to complete the peace in Europe, and he has decided to conclude treaties with Italy and Eastern European countries by the end of this year, no matter what. He believes that this is an essential step to restore the world's vitality. To achieve this goal, Byrnes seems ready to move forward bravely, even without cooperation with the Soviet Union if necessary.</p>
<p>Representatives of British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, French Foreign Minister Bidault, and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes have been continuously negotiating in Paris, but according to diplomatic sources here, they have not made any progress on resolving any major issues.</p>
<p>According to solemn declarations from diplomatic authorities: the upcoming Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference has two important paths to take, but it is unknown which one will be chosen. One is that the major powers cooperate together, and the other is that only Britain and the United States cooperate, while the Soviet Union intensifies its control over its sphere of influence, and France, due to the strong influence of the Communist Party within the country, has also become a difficult land to deal with. In other words, if the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference fails, the gap between the Soviet Union and the Western powers will widen further.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of atomic energy, it is said that the United States is prepared to make concrete proposals to establish an international atomic energy development agency, which will control all places in the world that produce atomic energy raw materials. According to this method, as all countries obtain guarantees internationally, then all countries, including the United States, will gradually publicly announce all their atomic energy information and secrets one by one.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Expresses Opposition to Expanding the Japanese Fishing Zone: There Will Be Heated Debates at the Control Council for Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] Well-informed sources said today: When the Control Council for Japan holds a meeting tomorrow, the United States and the Soviet Union may have a fierce conflict over the issue of expanding Japan's fishing area. Existing signs indicate that MacArthur intends to request the council to consider his proposal to expand the existing navigation area for Japanese fishing boats. U.S. Representative Atchison, based on the reason that Japan's food shortage is serious and needs to find more aquatic food, intends to propose expanding the new restricted area. However, according to United Press, Soviet Representative Televyanko seems to oppose any motion to expand the fishing area. According to some U.S. officials, the Soviet Union's excuse for opposing is that expanding the freedom of navigation of Japanese fishing boats may be intended to allow the Japanese to enter the Soviet Union's fishing area to the north.</p>
<h3>Bohlen's Visit to Moscow Allegedly Denied by the White House</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] White House Press Secretary Ross told reporters today: Reports that U.S. Reparations Commissioner Pauley will go to Moscow in July to contact Marshal Stalin on behalf of President Truman are purely speculative.</p>
<h3>The Azerbaijan Province Issue in Iran Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 11th] A Foreign Ministry spokesperson said today that the Azerbaijan province issue has been resolved in accordance with the seven-point plan proposed by Prime Minister Sadana a few weeks ago.

<h3>Setback in Political Transition: Italian King Refuses to Transfer Power; Cabinet Decides to Request the Prime Minister to Exercise the Powers of the Head of State; Royalist Demonstrations in Naples Advocate Southern Independence</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 11th: The Italian Cabinet held an emergency meeting today and unanimously decided to request Prime Minister Gasperi to immediately exercise the powers of a head of state. After the meeting, the Prime Minister immediately entered the palace to discuss this issue with Italian King Umberto.</p>
<p>Another report: The Italian King refused to abdicate, saying that he will not abdicate until the Supreme Court confirms the results of the referendum.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 11th, United Press] Italian King Umberto refused to transfer the powers of head of state to Prime Minister Gasperi at last night's ceremony. This was an unexpected setback in Italy's transition from a monarchy to a republic, as it was expected that the ceremony would only be a formality. The Italian Cabinet immediately convened an emergency meeting to consider the situation of the Italian King obstructing the reporting of the referendum votes. Gasperi went to the palace to meet with the Italian King, requesting that the Supreme Court formally announce the voting results.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 11th: The British Foreign Secretary today sent a telegram to the Italian Prime Minister, saying that the Italian national referendum was conducted very legally, and Britain's position on Italy remains unchanged.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 11th] The Italian Cabinet held an emergency meeting last night, which lasted for seven hours and did not end until 3 a.m. the next day. The possibility of holding a second referendum was discussed. It is heard that several ministers present believed that the establishment of the republic should be postponed, but no agreement was reached on this point.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Port of Naples, Italy, 11th] After the monarchy in Italy was overthrown by a referendum, the royalists were greatly angered. Today, royalists held a large-scale demonstration here, and the entire city was in turmoil. All Communist Party buildings were set on fire. The police came out in time to intervene, extinguished the fires, and fired shots into the air to disperse the crowd. This morning, the walls all over the city were plastered with leaflets from the "Committee for Separatist Action," which advocated that the southern provinces of Italy secede from the rest of the country. The reason was that the National Unity Treaty concluded in 1870 had been destroyed by the recent fraudulent and tyrannical referendum, and the southern provinces had to restore their political and economic freedom. By the afternoon, thousands of royalists paraded in the streets, demanding that all houses hang the flag of surrender of the Italian royal family. The city government did not hang the flag, and the protesters attacked it, smashing all the windows. Although the police used fire hoses to spray water on these people, the protesters did not care. The city government finally hung the flag, and the protesters withdrew but continued to parade in other streets. Finally, they were dispersed by the police, but the atmosphere throughout the city remained tense.</p>

<h3>New Types of War Are Becoming More and More Bizarre: Using Atomic Rays Can Wipe Out Fertility; Peaceful Uses Can Cause Rain</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 10th] French physicist Joliot, one of the first scientists to discover that uranium atoms can produce a chain reaction, from which the atomic bomb, atomic energy, and radiation are produced. Joliot recently published an article in the Chicago Atomic Scientists Bulletin and gave a speech in London, predicting a new type of nuclear war using invisible atomic rays secretly. Humans will have no way of knowing when the war starts. According to Joliot, "In the future, a country with hundreds of atomic bombs may think it is well-prepared, but suddenly it will receive a warning from a statistical expert saying that the number of miscarriages among pregnant women in the central region has surged in the past five years, and none of the six women has a normal delivery. Along the coastal ports, fires have destroyed harvests, and the northern region is experiencing drought, causing the country to lose a quarter of its power. Then the government and parliament will thoroughly investigate these figures, and there will be only one explanation, that someone has been secretly waging war against it for several years, resulting in tremendous damage and countless sacrifices, and no one even noticed when the war broke out." Joliot's method of wiping out fertility can be caused by enemy spies secretly emitting X-rays from radioactive atomic materials. However, it can also cause other harm to humans, which Joliot did not mention, nor did he explain why the people could not recognize these signs. Joliot did not say how the fires occurred or how the climate was manipulated but said that once atomic bombs can be used for peaceful purposes, they can be used to change most of the ground or cause rain in vast areas. Even today, we know that in the future, we can change terrain and climate. New radioactive elements will enable chemical changes to occur at extremely high temperatures. Other foreign scientists have also predicted that the climate can be regulated. However, American scientists have not made any predictions about the energy produced by uranium, thorium, and aluminum, the three important elements for producing atomic energy today.</p>
<h3>Prelude to Testing Atomic Bombs: Airplanes Take Off to Test-Drop Dummy Bombs</h3>
<p>[United Press, Near Bikini Atoll, Mount McKinley, 9th] The atomic bomb test unit's army and navy planes took off for the first time today, including about 75 planes from the bases of Kwajalein and Eniwetok and two aircraft carriers. Army Commander Major General Kepner took command on the flagship of Atomic Bomb Test Commander Vice Admiral Blandy. It is said that the test flight was satisfactory, but improvements are still needed in radio communication. During the test flight this morning, a B-29 plane dropped a dummy bomb from high altitude, but the personnel on the ship did not see it because the plane was flying too high and too fast. The test flight was explored by the flagship using radar.</p>

<h3>Albanian Political and Spiritual Leader Huseini Flees from Paris: Britain Lodges a Protest with France, Considering This an Unfriendly Act Towards Britain; Fears That the Tiger's Escape Will Affect the Situation in the Middle East</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 10th] Residents of the Old City of Jerusalem believe that Grand Mufti Huseini, the political and spiritual leader of the Palestinian Arabs, is on his way here. Arab flags and portraits of the Mufti are hung all over the streets of the Old City. Huseini was involved in the anti-British riots in Iraq in 1941.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The whereabouts of Grand Mufti Huseini of Jerusalem, who has disappeared from Paris, are still unknown. The claim that he has arrived in Damascus has been proven untrue. His brother-in-law, Huseini, chairman of the Arab Higher Committee, is now attending the Arab League Council meeting in Bludan, 40 miles from Damascus. The League Council sent a letter to the French government on April 6, thanking them for protecting Huseini.</p>
<p>Huseini</p>
<p>Was originally in Germany</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Nazis, he surrendered to the French authorities. Our correspondent in Paris said that the news of Huseini's disappearance is no less noteworthy than the question of who will be the next French president and prime minister. The French Foreign Ministry continues to express ignorance and surprise, and other authorities such as the police and the Ministry of the Interior are also silent. Rumors have it that Huseini's escape was aided by the British government. The "World Daily News" said that Huseini's escape was successful because Paris or London had no real intention of stopping his escape. However, according to well-informed diplomatic sources, the French Foreign Ministry's ignorance seems to be the truth, but the inside story is not known to outsiders. It is not easy to leave France by plane. How could the police and passport authorities know nothing? However, some Allied planes, including</p>
<p>Soviet planes,</p>
<p>Enjoy diplomatic privileges and take off and land at airports near Paris from time to time. When Huseini was in France, he often contacted his Middle Eastern friends. The Egyptian and Syrian embassies were his frequent destinations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The British Foreign Office has instructed the British Embassy in France to request an explanation from the French government regarding the disappearance of Grand Mufti Huseini of Jerusalem. The British government believes that the French government must be aware of the situation and that this is an "unfriendly act" towards Britain. British diplomatic circles pointed out that the French government is well aware of Britain's attitude towards Huseini. The British government informed the French side a few weeks ago that Huseini's return to the Middle East would be an "unwelcome and dangerous" move, as Huseini might once again organize an Arab army as in 1936.</p>
<p>Resist Britain</p>
<p>The British government does not believe that Huseini could have left France without official permission or collusion with some of the highest-ranking French officials. And although he was nominally under the supervision of the French police, he was actually able to freely contact Arab politicians at will. People close to the British Foreign Office frankly stated that due to the current delicate state of affairs in Palestine, Huseini's return to the Middle East will further complicate the situation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] A senior police officer in charge of managing foreigners in France is expected to be dismissed due to the disappearance of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. The Grand Mufti may have disguised himself as one of the members of the Arab delegation and mixed out of France. He had been ill recently, or may have pretended to be ill, so that it would be easier to disguise himself.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] The State Department announced today that it would investigate the rumor that the Grand Mufti of Palestine traveled part of the way from France to Syria on a U.S. military transport plane.</p>
<h3>Montgomery Convenes a Meeting of British Officials in Cairo</h3>

<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 10th] The Wingate Barracks in Cairo were handed over to the Egyptian army today. The barracks are very large and equipped with shops and classrooms. It is generally believed that this is another indication of the British army's preparation for withdrawal.</p>

In the plenary session, Wei declared: China's urgent need for ships is "between two to three million gross tons... Our country's existing tonnage is less than 100,000 tons, and most of it is small inland river vessels." He requested that Japan's merchant ships be fairly allocated a portion to China. He also said: "There is no reason why our country cannot replace Japan's former position." Wei continued, "We are a hundred years behind, and now we are trying our best to catch up. China has 450 million people, and it is hoped that China's needs will not be underestimated."</p>
<h3>Siam's New King Bhumibol – Is an Optimistic and Sport-Loving Child – The Death of the Late King Remains a Mystery to the Siamese People</h3>
<p>The 18-year-old new King Bhumibol of Siam, according to Siamese people familiar with him, is an optimistic and sport-loving child, and he will soon win the love of 1.8 million subjects.</p>
<p>The Siamese Chargé d'Affaires in the United States stated: The new King of Siam is a child who believes in democracy. He loves sports, and when he was in Switzerland, he practiced skiing.</p>
<p>Bhumibol and the late King Mahidol of Siam went to Switzerland to study together in 1933. They had returned to the country many times during vacations in recent years. After Siam was liberated, Mahidol returned to the country to succeed to the throne. Both of them returned to Bangkok in December of last year.</p>
<p>Speculation from the outside world suggests that the death of the late King Mahidol of Siam was not due to an accidental event. People close to Siam have expressed doubts about this. Although they have not received any information other than the official announcement, Siamese people firmly believe that no foreign or Siamese elements attempted to assassinate the late King Mahidol in order to seize the throne, because his younger brother, the new King of Siam, fully agreed with his policies.</p>
<p>These people stated: The late King Mahidol of Siam suffered from a glandular disease, which caused his height to exceed six feet—a height that is not common among Siamese people.</p>
<p>The remains of the late King will be placed in a golden urn, and a one-and-a-half-hour funeral ceremony will be held, with continuous cannon salutes. His remains will be dressed in full regalia and placed in the Dasiti Urn in the Royal Palace for the people to pay their respects before cremation. The death of the King of Siam remains a mystery to the Siamese people. The official explanation is that the King of Siam died accidentally due to mishandling an American pistol. Some parties do not accept this explanation. They accept the statement that the King of Siam had previously been ill, because he was unable to attend the cremation ceremony of the Chairman of the Regency Council held last Saturday.</p>

<h3>Inspector Cheng Enumerates Facts – Impeaching Grain Loan Malpractice – Proving Collusion Between Officials and Merchants – Yang Xizhi and Others Suspected of Major Embezzlement</h3>
<p>The grain loan malpractice case, which has attracted city-wide attention, has been thoroughly investigated by Jiangsu Regional Inspector Cheng Zhongxing. It has been proven that the Grain Administration Office is indeed suspected of collusion between officials and merchants for malpractice. He has listed ten facts and presented them to the Control Yuan for approval to initiate impeachment. The Jiangsu Inspectorate has recently announced the full text of the official letter to the Executive Yuan impeaching Yang Xizhi, Special Commissioner of the Grain Administration Office, Wang Darren, Commissioner concurrently acting as Office Manager, Ren Xingya, Chief of the Regulation Section, and Li Chongnian, Director of the Field Grain Administration and concurrently Special Commissioner of the Southeast Region and Chairman of the Yangtze River Grain Storage and Transportation Committee, for violating the law, dereliction of duty, and for being suspected of major embezzlement:</p>
<p>Regarding the impeachment of Yang Xizhi, Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration of the Ministry of Food, Wang Darren, Commissioner of the Ministry of Food concurrently Secretary of the Special Commissioner's Office acting as Office Manager, Ren Xingya, Chief of the Regulation Section, and Li Chongnian, Director of the Field Grain Administration of the Ministry of Food and concurrently Special Commissioner of the Southeast Region and Chairman of the Yangtze River Grain Storage and Transportation Committee, for violating the law and dereliction of duty: It is noted that the price of grain in Shanghai soared last month. Within a few days, the price of rice skyrocketed by more than 30,000 yuan, attracting international attention and causing public grievances to boil over. This has directly harmed people's livelihoods and indirectly damaged the government's credibility. This office dispatched a section chief and several investigators to the Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office, the Bean and Rice Trade Association, and the companies and firms that undertook grain loans to thoroughly investigate the truth. Based on the consolidated reports, the speculation and hoarding by some unscrupulous merchants is indeed one of the reasons for the fluctuations in the grain market, but the Grain Administration Office's handling of grain loans is suspicious and there are numerous violations, which is a major cause of this grain crisis. The evil of unscrupulous merchants is obvious, but the crime of corruption is hidden and difficult to see. For years, unscrupulous merchants have run rampant, and those who have supported and promoted them are corrupt officials. To eliminate unscrupulous merchants, we must first eliminate corrupt officials. To govern a chaotic country, one must use heavy penalties, and one must punish one to warn a hundred. The main points of the investigation are summarized below:</p>
<p>Ten Key Points</p>
<p>(1) It is found that the total amount of loans is 940 million yuan. In addition to the 40 million yuan undertaken by Fu Kang Rice Firm, the remaining fifteen companies, such as Wan Chang, each borrowed 60 million yuan. Any merchant with the ability to transport and sell rice and grain, even if not a member of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, can apply for a loan. The regulations are too broad, which opens the door for collusion between officials and merchants. Reviewing the process of handling the loans, it seems that various loopholes have been intentionally left, as if there is a tacit agreement. (2) It is found that there are more than 300 rice firms and 1,800 rice shops in Shanghai, many of which have solid capital and a long history. However, the capital amount of the sixteen firms approved by the Grain Administration Office to undertake grain loans is mostly between 4 and 5 million yuan. Even firms such as Xin Chang and Xie Changtai have only about 1 million yuan in capital, and Yong Shuntai, with 500,000 yuan in capital, undertook a huge loan of 60 million yuan. Fu Kang is a newly opened rice firm, and its internal structure seems to be a temporary organization. The Grain Administration Office did not examine these firms carefully and approved them, which violates the resolution of the first meeting of the Review Panel and is suspected of major collusion and private gain. (3) It is found that Wan Changxin and Wan Chang are opened by the same shop owner, Wan Molin. Xing Zhigang, the owner of Chengfeng Rice Firm, borrowed the name of Wan Changxin to come forward and undertake the grain loan, which is not what a legitimate businessman should do. Zhifeng mainly deals in miscellaneous grains, and it is difficult to determine whether it has the ability to transport and sell rice and grain. As for the Jiangbei Company, its business scope originally included the purchase, transportation, processing, and export of Jiangbei local products, as well as Jiangbei agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, industrial, and mining enterprises. Although it filled in the establishment of the Ministry of Food in its grain loan application, it has never purchased, transported, or sold rice and grain. Since it is not a member of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, its ability to transport and sell rice and grain is also questionable. This is clearly inconsistent with the provisions of Article 2 of the loan method. (4) It is found that the Grain Administration Office designated eight firms, including Wan Chang, which are operated by directors of the Bean and Rice Trade and members of the Miscellaneous Grain Reorganization Committee, to be submitted by the Chamber of Commerce. Wan Molin, Chairman of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, introduced Zhifeng, Xie Changtai, Huifeng, and Heng Taifeng. The Ministry of Food, through Li Chongnian, Director of the Field Grain Administration and concurrently Chairman of the Yangtze River Grain Storage and Transportation Committee, introduced the Changjiang, Jiangbei, and Tongyi Companies to be submitted by Wan Molin. Fu Kang Rice Firm was secretly negotiated by the Grain Administration Office and its manager Shao Ligao and entrusted to Wan Molin for submission, which is clearly suspected of collusion between officials and merchants with the intention of making profits. On the surface, it was approved by the Review Panel, but the amount of grain submitted for review, with sixteen applicants, and sixteen approved, applicants did not have multiple applicants or excess amounts, so that reviewers could have strict selection to the option. Moreover, during the review, the applicant firm and the review committee sat in the same room, making it impossible for the review committee to freely express their opinions. According to the investigation, most of the sixteen firms applying for grain loans were</p>
<p>pre-arranged and set up in advance by the Grain Administration Office,</p>
<p>and then submitted by the association or chamber of commerce. The review was merely a formality, and the collusion and manipulation were very obvious. Wang Darren, the acting manager of the Grain Administration Office who presided over the meeting, and Ren Xingya, the Chief of the Regulation Section, should be held responsible. (5) It is found that most of the purchasing areas of the grain loan merchants are in Wuxi, Suzhou, Changshu, Kunshan, Qingpu, and Songjiang. These places are close to Shanghai. When they heard the news of the grain loans, they first raised the price of rice. Later, due to large-scale purchases from outside, the price of rice in various places rose sharply day by day. The establishment of grain loans was originally intended to enrich the food supply for the people of Shanghai (Article 1 of the Grain Merchants Loan Method), but in fact, as a result of its implementation, the food supply for the people of Shanghai has become even more difficult due to the poor management of the Grain Administration Office. The food supply for the people in the neighboring counties of Shanghai has also suffered from high prices. The Grain Administration Office did not carefully consider the purchasing areas in advance, and it was also indifferent afterwards, allowing merchants and the people to freely purchase grain, allowing the food supply for the people in the neighboring counties of Shanghai to undergo sudden changes. The food supply for the people of Shanghai must be enriched, but should the food supply for the people outside of Shanghai be ignored? In the end, the price of rice in Shanghai and its neighboring counties rose at the same time. The principle of establishing grain loans was not carefully considered, and during its implementation, there was even</p>
<p>selfish intent.</p>
<p>The responsible personnel of the Grain Administration Office should all be held responsible for negligence and private gain. (6) It is found that the rice purchased by Changjiang Company from Fengjing, Songjiang, Nanjing, and other places arrived in Shanghai as early as April 24 and May 4, but the starting date of sales was May 15. The rice and grain arrived in Shanghai for ten days, but it was not sold in the market. The company's existing grain still has 956 dan and 3 dou, and 950 bags, some of which are brown rice that arrived in Shanghai after May 20. The company delayed processing and selling the brown rice after it was transported, and it is difficult to understand what its intentions were. This is one point. The selling prices of the rice transported to Shanghai by various grain merchants varied, and most did not follow the resolution of the Review Committee to depreciate the price by 2,000 yuan according to the closing market price of every other day. This is the second point. After receiving the loans, some firms, such as Changjiang Company, Xie Changtai, and Huifeng, did not immediately set out to purchase grain. Firms such as Wan Chang and Zhifeng purchased and sold rice in Shanghai, but the proceeds were not immediately deposited in the lending bank. It is also found that the loan checks of Jiangbei Company had stubs for payments to Ling Ziwen and Wang Zuqi of the Frontline Daily, totaling around 20 million yuan, which is suspected of using the loan for other purposes. This is the third point. Such cases are too numerous to mention, but the Grain Administration Office, which is responsible for supervision and assessment, did not intervene, and it is undeniable that it has neglected its duties. (7) It is found that in late April, when the price of rice was gradually rising, the Grain Administration Office, on the pretext of disputes in the market, directly ordered the suspension of sales of rice purchased with grain loans, which lasted for more than ten days, accumulating as much as 17,000 dan of rice, causing other grain merchants to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The market had demand but no supply, and the price of rice soared as a result. (Note: On April 26, the price of thin rice was 35,000 yuan per dan, and by May 11, it had reached 48,000 yuan.) Its improper handling is obvious. (8) It is found that when applying for loans, each grain loan merchant had to pay a review fee of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The loan method approved by the Ministry of Food did not have this provision, which is clearly establishing a pretext to seek profit and is suspected of major embezzlement. (9) The total amount of grain loans is 940 million yuan, but the interest collected is only 3% per month. The national treasury spends such huge sums of money to organize grain loans, but the personnel in charge of grain administration cannot appreciate the difficulties of the national finances or alleviate the hardships of the people. They take advantage of the opportunity to</p>
<p>squander national funds and harm people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Their intentions and actions are not tolerated by the law. (10) Although Yang Xizhi, the Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration, has now gone abroad, the decision to organize grain loans and various operations were all planned by him before he went abroad. The personnel executing the grain loans were also appointed by him. After he went abroad, the affairs of the Special Commissioner's Office were actually managed by Wang Darren, the secretary of the office. All kinds of grain loans were also handled by him, carrying on the work from above and passing it on below. Ren Xingya, the Chief of the Regulation Section, was the one who actually carried out the work. When the loans were approved, criticism and attacks were already very fierce, but the authorities of the Grain Administration Office dared to ignore this and acted without any scruples. What is Wang Darren relying on to be so fearless, and who is the mastermind behind him? This concerns the governance and chaos of the country. Foxes and wolves should be punished equally, otherwise, it is not enough to rectify the root and clear the source.</p>
<p>In summary, Yang Xizhi, Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration, Wang Darren, Commissioner of the Ministry of Food concurrently Secretary of the Shanghai Special Commissioner's Office acting as Office Manager, Ren Xingya, Chief of the Regulation Section, and Li Chongnian, Director of the Field Grain Administration of the Ministry of Food and concurrently Special Commissioner of the Southeast Region and Chairman of the Yangtze River Grain Storage and Transportation Committee, used their authority to collude with merchants, causing a grain crisis in Shanghai and harming people's livelihoods. They have violated the law, derelicted their duties, and are suspected of major embezzlement. In accordance with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the revised Provisional Measures for the Exercise of Supervisory Powers in Extraordinary Times, we are submitting this to the Control Yuan for approval to initiate impeachment. In addition to the above-mentioned personnel and the relevant grain merchants, whose cases involve criminal aspects and will be transferred to the court for investigation, we hope that you will investigate and handle the case in accordance with the law and provide a response on the handling situation. To the Executive Yuan. Cheng Zhongxing, Inspector of the Jiangsu Supervisory District of the Control Yuan.</p>

However, it is hoped that all matters can be completed before the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Jin Zhuan Case Under Interrogation – Managers of Chongqing Bank and Others Detained and Released on Bail Separately</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The central bank's massive theft case, due to the detention of gold bricks, has implicated Shanghai Bank, Chongqing Bank, Qintai Money Shop, and Xinda Stock Company. The inside story is complicated. After the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office, the Ministry of Finance also attached great importance to it. In view of the fact that the relevant banks and money shops have arbitrarily detained gold bricks and debt securities, which violates financial regulations and is illegal, a special order was issued for a thorough investigation. The District Prosecutor's Office summoned all relevant banks and money shops the afternoon before yesterday for the first investigative hearing, which lasted for several hours. It was believed that Wu Minggang, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of Chongqing Bank, Pan Jialiu, Head of the Business Section and Assistant Manager of Shanghai Bank, Wang Jiamei, person in charge of Xinda Stock Company, and others were suspected of serious crimes and were detained. As for Zhu Zhifei, General Manager of the Shanghai Branch of Chongqing Bank, the part about altering the accounts was not related to this case, so he was allowed to leave on bail. Yu Shiyang of Qintai Money Shop was ordered to pay a cash bail of 2 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain Administration Office Ordered to Be Abolished – Shanghai Storage and Transportation Office to Be Established</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is learned that the Shanghai Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office has recently received an order from the Ministry of Food to be abolished immediately, and all outstanding matters must be completed by the end of June. The Ministry of Food has decided that the control of grain matters in Shanghai should be entrusted to the Social Affairs Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government upon request, and the collection of field tax should be entrusted to the Finance Bureau. As for the receipt and dispatch of military grain, the supervision and management of grain processing factories, and other receipt and dispatch businesses related to grain and food in Shanghai, the Shanghai Grain Storage and Transportation Office will be established to handle these matters. It is also learned that Yang Xizhi has been appointed as the Director of the Storage and Transportation Office, and Ye Xinming and Wang Darren as the Deputy Directors.</p>

<h3>Welcome Rally for the First Batch of Youth Army</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The welcome rally for the first batch of demobilized youth army to arrive in Shanghai, organized by various circles in the city, was held at the Majestic Theatre at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 2,000 officers and soldiers attended, and representatives from various circles included Mayor Wu Guozhen, Zhuang Heren from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Fu Tongguang from the Municipal Provisional Assembly, and Wang Xiaolai from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. After the formalities were completed, the mayor gave a speech, stating that the youth army was established at the most critical time for the country. You were able to give up your pens for swords and were willing to sacrifice. Today, I would like to extend my highest respect on behalf of all the citizens of Shanghai. You may regret not being able to kill the enemy on the battlefield, but from the government's standpoint, we are not willing to see you sacrifice easily, because you are all the most outstanding cadres and are the best foundation for establishing a future conscription system. At present, the atmosphere in Shanghai is one of extravagance, and the general public lacks a sense of national identity and national consciousness. During your stay in Shanghai, I hope that you can demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of the new army everywhere, "Live for the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun, and die for the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun," to set an example for all the citizens of Shanghai and correct the bad atmosphere. After the speech, Ms. Wang Weiwei of the Student Federation, representing various circles, presented flowers to all officers and soldiers to pay tribute. Then, Zhuang Heren of the Party Headquarters and Fu Tongxian of the Provisional Assembly gave speeches one after another. Huang Huaijin, a student of Xiehe University and representative of the Youth Army, gave a reply, expressing gratitude for the generous hospitality of various circles, and said that they would work hard on national construction to complete the new China of the Three Principles of the People. Finally, the entertainment began, with Deng Guoqing's artistic performances and the screening of the China Electric Company's new film "Return My Hometown." It ended happily at 12:30 p.m.</p>

<h3>Murder Without Fear of Bloodshed: Foreman Becomes Rogue – Old Thief Chang Yuqing on Trial, Hypocritically Recites Buddhist Sutras While Clasping Hands, Feigns Deafness and Dumbness, Shirking All Responsibility – Judge Xiao Angrily Rebukes</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] During the early stages of the War of Resistance, anyone living in Shanghai, which had recently fallen, would have shuddered at the mention of the "Huangdao Society." Before their eyes would appear eight heads hanging from telephone poles, blood dripping from their necks, their faces displaying indescribable horror. Attached to these heads were slips of paper, written in bright red (perhaps the blood of patriots!), bearing eight frightening characters: "See, the fate of patriots!" This atrocity, only conceivable by despotic monarchs, once disturbed the hearts of the people. Yet Chang Yuqing, the chief traitor who led the "Huangdao Society" in brutally killing patriotic heroes, is now finally being brought to justice in our national court.</p>
<p>Chang, a native of Jiangling, Hubei, is sixty-two years old. Before the war, he was merely a foreman in the Shanghai cotton mills of Japanese companies Toyota, Tongxing, and Dakang, as well as the chairman of the Huangpu Bund ironworkers' union. Starting in 1937, he colluded with Japanese aggressors Xichuan Dabao, Fu Xiaoan, and others to form a "Maintenance Society," but failed. He then conspired with Japanese ronin Takahashi Kamii and Xu Fei, a liaison for the Japanese military, to organize the "Huangdao Society," using the New Asia Hotel on Sichuan Road as their headquarters. They committed all kinds of evil deeds, creating an unprecedented reign of terror in Shanghai. Even Liang Hongzhi, the leader of the "Reform Government," disapproved of his actions, leading him to flee to Nanjing to form the "Anqing Gang," recruiting followers and continuing to serve as a pawn for the enemy.</p>
<p>During the trial yesterday morning, the traitor Chang wore a blue silk long gown, with his sleeves rolled up to reveal a white shirt underneath. He wore black cloth shoes, and his thumb moved incessantly as he spoke, maintaining the style of a "street hustler." However, he walked as if he were shackled, claiming to have kidney problems. When answering questions, he feigned deafness and dumbness, deliberately misinterpreting the judge's questions. He spent a full seven minutes on the single question of whether he had been a "foreman," infuriating Judge Xiao. As for the charge of instigating the "Huangdao Society" to commit murder, he denied it completely, saying, "I am a vegetarian who worships Buddha and is afraid even to kill a chicken. How could I kill people? Besides, I am so fat and cannot even walk properly." As he spoke, he clasped his hands in a show of false piety. Judge Xiao immediately rebuked him, saying, "Liang Hongzhi is your comrade. He acknowledges your deeds and even expresses disapproval. Are you still denying it?" Chang paused briefly and quietly said, "If that is what he says, there is nothing I can do." But Judge Xiao went further, saying, "Millions of people in Shanghai know of your crimes and say that you committed the murders. They have no feud with you. Why would they accuse you if it were not true!" Chang stammered and could not answer for a long time, finally mumbling, "I have never done anything against my conscience." After the court thoroughly questioned him about the crimes listed in the indictment, they decided to postpone the hearing. The defendant was remanded into custody.

<h3>June 18th "Dragon Ball": Australian Overseas Chinese Live Well, Annual Grand Ball, Proceeds Donated to National Relief, Interview with Madam Zheng</h3>
<p>"There are a total of 11,000 overseas Chinese in Australia. Although many of them have lived abroad for a long time and do not fully understand China's current situation, the overseas Chinese in Australia have never forgotten their motherland and are particularly concerned about the suffering of their compatriots. The amount of money they contribute to the country each year is enormous," said Madam Chen Leyi, wife of Zheng Yitong, the ambassador to Australia, when talking to reporters about the situation of overseas Chinese in Australia yesterday.</p>
<p>Zheng Yitong was ordered to serve as the ambassador to Australia in August last year. He returned to China last month to attend important meetings in the wartime capital. Madam Zheng accompanied him to Shanghai. She will take her two sons back to Australia within the next week, and four other sons and daughters have already gone to Australia last year. Madam Zheng is from Hangzhou and speaks fluent Shanghainese and English.</p>
<p>Madam Zheng told reporters that overseas Chinese in Australia always hold a grand ball every year on June 18th, which they call the "Dragon Ball." Invitations are sent to various places three months before the event, showing how much they value this annual event. But they are not just having fun; the proceeds from the tickets for this ball are entirely sent back to China each year and given to Madam Chiang for relief efforts. The opening ceremony is usually hosted by the ambassador and his wife. This year, because Ambassador Zheng still has official business to attend to, he cannot return in time to host it, so Madam Zheng is eager to return to Australia, also for this matter.</p>
<p>Most of the overseas Chinese in Australia are from Guangdong or Fujian. They ship handicrafts such as lace and embroidery to Australia for sale, and their businesses are doing very well. Australia produces a large amount of fruit and flowers, but to buy the most beautifully decorated flowers or fruit, you have to go to the shops run by overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The British and local people in Australia are quite friendly to the overseas Chinese. However, for policy reasons, they do not welcome large numbers of immigrants. (Our reporter, Mai Tian) (Ambassador Zheng and his wife are pictured above)</p>

<h3>Jiaozuo Institute of Technology: Restoration Funds Not Secured, Appeals for Support from All Parties</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Kaifeng by Dahuashe News Agency] Jiaozuo Institute of Technology, a well-known school of engineering and mining in our country, was founded by the Zhongfu Coal Mine. In 1938, it was ordered to move to Tianshui and merged with the engineering colleges of Dongda, Pingda, and Beiyang to form the Northwest Institute of Technology. After the victory, the Ministry of Education approved its restoration. However, the operating expenses of the school are subsidized by the Zhongfu United Office, the Henan Provincial Government, the Gengkuan Committee, and the Ministry of Education respectively. Now that the restoration is imminent, but the Zhongfu Coal Mine has not yet started operations, and the support from other parties has not been determined. This has caused the school's restoration preparatory committee great hesitation. It is estimated that the cost of relocation and other expenses will be about 110 million yuan, and the annual operating expenses will be 60 million yuan, but there is no funding. Therefore, it can only appeal to all parties in the country to provide strong support to cultivate talents for the country.</p>

<h3>Jiang Weiqiao, President of Chengming College, Cares for Refugees in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Donates All 130,000 Yuan of Conference Funds for Relief</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in This City] Jiang Weiqiao, President of Chengming College of Arts and Sciences, recently went to Zhenjiang to attend the Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Assembly.

<h3>The Ministry of Education Orders Chengming College Faculty and Students to Withdraw from the Bethany Orphanage</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in This City] The Bethany Orphanage on Zhabei Datong Road was founded by Pastor Qian, and is one of the most well-managed and idealistic charitable institutions in Shanghai. During the occupation of this city, the orphanage secretly took in comrades sought by the enemy police and refused any rations such as flour from the puppet regime, demonstrating great righteousness, which is especially commendable. The Zhabei site was purchased from the private property of Wang Xishen. Chengming College, due to its connection with Zhengfeng, requested to take over the orphanage and filed a lawsuit, while also instructing dozens of faculty and students to forcibly invade, disrupting the peace of the orphanage and leading to housing disputes for several months. In the initial trial, Chengming lost the case because the orphanage's contract procedures and evidence were confirmed. However, the students of Chengming University, relying on the so-called "fait accompli," remained in front of hundreds of orphans, refusing to leave. The Ministry of Education is also very concerned about this matter. After investigating the truth, it has ordered all faculty and students of Chengming College occupying the houses to withdraw.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Curriculum Research Session (V) - English Should Not Be Included in the Elementary School Curriculum</h3>
<p>I am a layman when it comes to drafting elementary school curriculum standards, but I believe that the inclusion of English in the curriculum of elementary school third grade in Shanghai (although not stipulated in the curriculum standards) is worthy of research and discussion. Elementary education is the basic education of citizens. Students in elementary school third grade are usually under the age of ten. They have not been in school for long, and they only have a superficial understanding of their native language. According to the current elementary school curriculum, in addition to Chinese, there are also subjects such as arithmetic, general knowledge, and civics. This is already quite burdensome for a child under ten years old. If we add an English course, how can they digest it? It is common to see students review their homework after school, switching between Chinese and English, feeling dizzy and frustrated. As a result, due to limited brainpower, they gain little from English, while the foundation of Chinese is not well established due to the heavy workload. The recent widespread decline in the Chinese proficiency of elementary school students is a clear proof. I believe that the standard for drafting elementary school curriculum should be based on the basic subjects that students can intellectually grasp. To cultivate students' physical fitness, the curriculum should not be too heavy. There is absolutely no need to include English in the elementary school curriculum. Although English is quite important for employment as an adult, it can be included as a subject from the first grade of junior high school, which is not too late for those who have the opportunity to receive secondary education. I believe this is not only my personal opinion, but probably also the voice of most parents! (Lu Gongwu, 35, 6, 10, at the Shanghai Jiaotong Bank.)</p>
<h3>The Hong Kong Eastern Allied Forces Change to a New Formation to Face the Dark Horse Jewish Team Today at 5:30 PM at the Yiyuan Stadium</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Eastern Allied Football Team, on their expedition to Shanghai, easily defeated the British Navy 6-0 in their first match and cleverly captured the Western Allied team 4-1 in their second match. Their momentum is unmatched for a time. The Eastern team is full of energy, with excellent passing, good offense and defense, and superior ball skills. Shanghai fans are enthusiastically supporting them.

Ticket prices remain the same and will be sold at the Municipal Stadium starting at 3:00 PM. The referee is Jiang Yinseng, and the linesmen are Chen Jixiang and Jin Jiabiao.</p>
<p>Today, the Eastern Allied team is deploying a new formation. According to Captain Xu Jingcheng, except for goalkeeper Zhu Zhaohong, who remains unchanged, Captain Xu will switch to left back, Huo Yaohua will take the position of center back, Guo Yingqi will be the commander, and Feng Jingxiang and Li Zhaorong will take a short break today to conserve their energy for the battle with Donghua the day after tomorrow. With Captain Xu's presence on the defense, it will be even more solid. Huo Yuehua's center back position will surely be all-encompassing. Zhang Jinhai's move to the right, supplemented by Guo Yingqi's central army, will not reduce the offensive power, and Guo's iron leg is admired by all. Today, facing the Jewish team, it will not be difficult to win in one go.</p>
<p>The Jewish team's lineup has also been arranged to cope with the visiting team. The Jewish team, known as the Dark Horse, has a fighting force that is unpredictable. Oliveira, the center back, is unmatched in Shanghai, with both offense and defense being just right. In addition, the veteran Di Fei is making a comeback, partnering with Da Chong Fafanxiao, which can be described as a perfect match. Lai Fan will assist on the left (but W. Pantunson may come off the bench). Lai Liao will retreat as a fresh force. The strength of the lineup has been increased by this change, but it is still feared that it will be difficult to defeat the expeditionary army. The lineups of the two armies today are recorded below:</p>
<p>Eastern Allied Forces</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaohong</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan Huo Yaohua Feng Kunsheng</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Plans to Establish an International Cultural and Educational Affairs Department</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Ministry of Education believes that international cultural and educational affairs are becoming increasingly complex and important. It plans to establish an International Cultural and Educational Affairs Department within the ministry to specialize in the management of international students, exchange professors, and other matters. It is currently preparing to submit a request to the Executive Yuan. In the past, international cultural and educational affairs were handled by the Fourth Section of the Higher Education Department, which included the International Cultural Committee, later renamed the Sino-American Cultural Committee, and the Sino-British Academic Cooperation Committee. However, due to the small organization and limited funding, it was insufficient to expand the work.</p>

<h3>Discussions on Governing the Yellow River (1)</h3>
<p>— Chu Tongan</p>
<p>This article was written by Mr. Chu Tongan after reading Mr. Yang Mengming's "Turning Water Calamities into Water Benefits" published in this newspaper on May 10th. Mr. Chu has studied water conservancy for many years, widely consulted various books, and incorporated practical experience from field investigations. The points listed in the article largely complement Mr. Yang's article. Therefore, we are urgently publishing it for the reference of relevant authorities and domestic Yellow River management experts. ——Editor</p>
<p>The Yellow River, the Yellow River, this great river that has plagued the Central Plains for thousands of years, every time it floods and breaches its banks, the raging torrents swallow countless people and livestock and destroy immense wealth. How can this untamable venomous dragon be subdued? How can its harmful aspects be turned into beneficial ones? This is the most urgent and concerning issue in our country's current revitalization and construction. Now, based on my limited knowledge, I offer some suggestions, hoping that knowledgeable and virtuous individuals in the country will discuss them.</p>
<p>(A) Reasons for Yellow River Floods and Breaches</p>
<p>To manage the Yellow River, the first thing to do is to understand the reasons for its floods and breaches, and then prescribe the right remedy for treatment. Now, I analyze the reasons as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Overly Loose Soil: The Yellow River basin is a vast loess plateau, extending north to Suiyuan and west to Shaanxi and Gansu. For thousands of years, the harsh winds from the northern desert have blown countless fine sands into this area. These fine sands have accumulated year after year, forming the thick loess layer of today. However, this type of soil is very loose and easily eroded by water. Therefore, the Yellow River flowing through this area naturally carries a large amount of sediment into its riverbed, resulting in excessive sediment accumulation. Furthermore, due to the lack of firmness of the soil, dikes and embankments built with it are prone to collapse.</p>
<p>(2) Uneven Terrain: The Yellow River originates from Xingxiu Lake and flows through the mountainous areas of the upper reaches. Below Zhongwei, it gradually enters the plains, and the flow becomes slower. At the Tuoketuo River mouth in Suiyuan, it turns south and passes through the Qinpu Mountains. Within 700 li, confined by the mountains, it descends 800 feet, resulting in a very rapid flow. Passing the Zhuti Mountains, it drops another 200 feet, making the flow even more turbulent. However, from Mengjin down to the sea, the river flows for over 2,000 li through the vast North China loess plain. The terrain is flat, with Mengjin less than 100 feet above sea level. Naturally, the river flow is slow and meandering, and sediment easily accumulates in the riverbed, gradually leading to a situation where the riverbed is higher than the surrounding land. Both overly rapid and overly slow river flows contribute to water disasters.</p>
<p>(3) Lack of Forests and Lakes in the Entire Basin for Water Storage and Discharge: Originally, there were abundant forests in the Yin Mountains, the Wen Mountains, and the northern parts of Shaanxi and Gansu. However, due to excessive deforestation over the years, there are no longer any significant forests in Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Suiyuan, and Shanxi. These areas are now barren mountains and bald ridges, unable to retain water. Furthermore, the entire basin is a loess area formed by windblown sand, lacking any lakes to store and discharge the Yellow River's water. As a result, the entire basin's rainfall can only be accommodated by the Yellow River itself, without any regulation.</p>
<p>(4) Influence of Climate: The climate in the Yellow River basin is continental. Rainfall is usually very scarce, and in April and May, there are often prolonged droughts. However, due to excessive heat in the summer (indoor temperatures sometimes reaching over 100 degrees), combined with the invasion of southern monsoons, the moisture in the air increases. When cold winds from the northern high pressure system invade in late summer and early autumn, heavy rains occur, often lasting for several days and covering the entire basin. These heavy rains fall on the loess barren mountains, instantly turning dry mountain streams into torrents with extremely high flow rates, with water volumes differing by hundreds of times. Once this widespread floodwater flows into the Yellow River, the river cannot withstand it, leading to breaches and floods that are beyond control.</p>
<p>Now we can observe the Yellow River's water disasters: We know that "river disasters" often occur in the "downstream" section. At Mengjin, the Yellow River is about three li wide. From there downwards, the river is about five li wide in narrow sections and about ten li wide in wide sections. However, the riverbed where the Yellow River regularly flows is only a few dozen zhang wide and less than a xun zhang deep. With this water flow, there should not be any water disasters. However, when widespread heavy rains occur in most of the basin, the phenomenon of "autumn floods arriving suddenly, with hundreds of rivers flowing into the river" occurs. Furthermore, due to the constricting effect of places like Zhuti Mountain, the flow becomes even more turbulent. With such a riverbed experiencing a sudden increase in flow of dozens or hundreds of times in an instant, combined with a very surging and turbulent flow, eroding the loess-built riverbanks, collapses and breaches are naturally very easy to occur. In fact, not only the Yellow River, but also smaller rivers in the north can often cause water disasters. For example, the Luo River, a tributary of the Yellow River, which sometimes has no water, once flooded Yanshi County, simply because of two consecutive days of heavy rain. Heavy rain without forests and lakes to store and regulate water is the main cause of the Yellow River's water disasters. Sediment deposition in the riverbed, rising river levels, loose soil, and unstable embankments are secondary causes of the Yellow River's breaches.</p>
<p>(B) My Views on Managing the Yellow River</p>
<p>(1) Comparison of the Management of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River: Understanding the reasons for the Yellow River's floods and breaches allows us to formulate a management plan. Now, let's compare the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. The Yangtze River is not without its disadvantages. The Yangtze River has the Three Gorges, just as the Yellow River has the Zhuti Mountains, and the water flow is equally rapid. The lowlands of the Chu region - the Yunmeng Plain - are like the vast plains of the lower Yellow River, so thousands of li of long dikes have been built to protect against it. However, the Yangtze River's water level difference is not as severe as the Yellow River's, and it has large lakes such as Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake to regulate water volume, so there are no serious water disasters. However, recently, Dongting Lake has become increasingly silted up, so the areas around the two lakes often experience floods. Recently, the American hydraulic expert Dr. Savage came to investigate the Yangtze River's water conservancy. He believes that building a sluice gate at the Three Gorges west of Yichang, creating a narrow and long artificial lake in the Three Gorges area, would not only regulate the Yangtze River's upstream water volume but also permanently eliminate the floods in the Chu region, even if Dongting Lake were completely silted up. Furthermore, this water power could be used to generate a large amount of electricity, which could be widely supplied to the entire Central China region, electrifying agriculture and industry. This would transform the harmful parts of the Yangtze River into the most beneficial parts. Although it would require an investment of $1.3 billion, this investment could likely be recovered with interest in a very short time with ample surplus. This shows that using the technology of building sluice gates to create "artificial lakes" can not only regulate water volume but also utilize its water power for electricity generation. Then, based on the Yellow River's water volume during floods, if a suitable location can be found to build a sluice gate, could this not also turn harmful aspects into beneficial ones? But where is the most suitable location? (To be continued)</p>
<h3>In Last Night's Dream</h3>

<h3>Scattered Notes from Prison (3)</h3>
<p>— Yao Falcon</p>
<p>Revelation of Life</p>
<p>Every day, after getting up in the morning, I take a small bamboo stool and sit by the inner courtyard of the prison, looking up at the strip of blue sky, about three chi wide and three zhang long, quietly watching the sunlight projected onto the top of the brick wall, three or four zhang high, slowly move down. Several sparrows chirp and play in the corner of the wall, sometimes whispering to each other, sometimes spreading their wings and flying together, and sometimes taking advantage of people's inattention to swoop down, pick up a grain of leftover rice, and fly back to their nests to feed their young chicks.</p>
<p>After some time, there are several small sparrows following their parents to learn to fly.</p>
<p>In this prison, the only living creatures that can be seen, besides these sparrows, are a pair of Angora rabbits. These are probably kept by the warden or one of the guards, but I never see their owner taking care of them. They spend all day with their red eyes open, covered in soft, long, white fur, jumping back and forth inside and outside the wooden fence, picking up the leftover prison rations we drop.</p>
<p>These are two naughty fellows. They run around everywhere, sniffing and digging, wanting to eat everything, especially at night, when they refuse to settle down. They even steal the extra dishes that the inmates have secretly added, knocking over the bowls covering them. In the morning, we find that they have dragged our shoes into their burrows.</p>
<p>However, they are not scolded. In this prison, these two small lives are treated with love and favor. The inmates treat them as treasures, hugging and stroking them when they have time, or squatting down, pursing their lips and making "you you" sounds to tease them, and even sharing their meager food with them. Their lives are the subject of unusual concern.</p>
<p>Not long ago, one day, we found them digging a hole in the corner of the wall near the toilet. The hole was very well made. They used their hind feet to smooth out the soil piled up at the entrance on the ground, so that people would not easily notice the traces. The inside of the hole was lined with rice straw they had carried and fine fur shed from their bodies, but not even a blade of grass could be seen at the entrance. But finally, we discovered it. Upon inspection, we found that they had already given birth to a pair of small cubs, whose eyes were already open and whose fur had grown full. So, everyone rushed to the two fluffy little lives like a swarm of bees, surrounding them, vying to stroke them with their rough, dark palms, and blessing them, making a commotion for most of the day, like a group of big children. Later, we caught the mother rabbit every day to feed them milk. Now, these two little cubs can also jump and hop inside and outside the wooden fence.</p>
<p>These small creatures are a revelation to me.</p>
<p>Life is mysterious and incredible. In some respects, it is very fragile, and can be lost at any time. But at the same time, it is unusually strong. No matter what the environment, it will survive. Even in this death-filled prison, relying only on the leftovers of the prisoners, the sparrows and rabbits still live on, and even continue their offspring, so that this small life does not come to an end.</p>
<p>This is just as Jesus Christ said: "... Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"</p>
<p>Therefore, one should understand why, in prison, those prisoners who have been sentenced to life imprisonment, whose families have stopped providing assistance and whose relatives and friends do not visit, are able to live stubbornly, relying only on a portion of prison rations that is not enough to fill them but is enough to keep them from starving.</p>
<p>Life is fragile, but it is even more tenacious. I will live on more persistently.</p>
<p>In this prison, I accidentally came across an old newspaper that had been used to wrap something. On the back of the newspaper, there was an unremarkable article that quoted a few words from the Swedish philosopher Doe. Xun Smith's "Theory of Crime": "... Legislators are guilty, and their judges are prisoners... A prisoner is successful because he does not have the talent for fraud..."</p>
<p>These words gave me a deep feeling. If I had read these words outside before, I might have thought that this was a literary flourish, or at least a bit of an exaggeration. But now, because of the various facts that I have seen with my own eyes and heard with my own ears, I know that there is truth in his words. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Rainy Night</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>Another desolate rainy night.</p>
<p>Lately, I have really been afraid of rainy nights. I fear the murmuring sound that seems to complain and lament. I fear the thunder and lightning in the dark and chaotic world. I fear the relentless cold wind hitting my windows. I fear the gray walls, the black shadows, the terrifying sky, the chaotic earth.</p>
<p>I put on a thin coat and sit by the window. I silently stare at a dim lamp. I have no tears to shed, no sighs to utter, yet I am still in pain, still have to recall.</p>
<p>I recall that once, on a similarly desolate rainy night, I sat under this dim lamp writing a letter to her. I told her that I was grateful for her remembrance and thanked her for her comfort. But most importantly, I wanted to tell her:</p>
<p>"Now is a chaotic dark night. I know you are awake. Go!"</p>
<p>I spread a clean white piece of paper on the table. My pen tip moved on it incessantly, but when I wrote this sentence, my fingers trembled. A question welled up in my heart: I am so insignificant, can I write this to her?</p>
<p>I considered myself prudent, considered myself clever. So, in the end, I did not write that sentence.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, that bit of prudence caused eternal regret. That bit of cleverness left behind bottomless heartache!</p>
<p>The chaotic dark night has passed, but she can no longer see the bright daylight, and I can no longer see her gentle face.</p>
<p>Tonight, it is another desolate rainy night. I have no tears to shed, no sighs to utter, yet I am still in pain, still unable to forget that unfortunate friend!</p>
<h3>Long Serial Novel: Shuang Su Shuang Fei (Paired Flight) (52)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Despite Mr. Liao's propaganda, the miraculous effects of the foreign doctor attracted people irresistibly. No one believed that the foreign doctor was cheating, and no one believed that Mr. Liao's words were true! It was a small matter that the business of Huichuntang became deserted. Mr. Liao's good intentions to save the public were wasted, which made him sad! Mr. Liao's psychology of hoping for human health was not at all hypocritical. It was just that he stubbornly believed that the treatment of the foreign doctor and the effectiveness of those foreign medicines were not due to the foreign doctor's high medical skills or the goodness of the foreign medicine; but first, it was the luck of the patients, and second, the foreign doctor and the foreign medicine were lucky! In any case, using scissors and knives to treat diseases was something that Mr. Liao dared not and could not flatter!</p>
<p>However, in fact, since the foreign doctor and the foreign medicines became popular, most of the patients recovered, and none died. As time went on, Mr. Liao's anger subsided slightly, because he had calmly thought that as long as everyone was healthy, it would be good! Although seeing a blank page when the bell rang at night to settle accounts was an embarrassing pain for him! Especially when the proprietress nagged incessantly, it made him even more annoyed, but he was able to restrain the development of his selfish instincts with a compassionate heart.</p>
<p>Mr. Liao was still a kind and honest man after all!</p>
<p>The proprietress was a woman, a woman who had not received a good education; and a woman who was born narrow-minded; a woman from a butcher's family; therefore, she could not be as open-minded and benevolent as Mr. Liao! She had endured for a long time, and finally one day she could not bear it anymore. She found an excuse to "launch a punitive expedition" against Mr. Liao!</p>
<p>"Life is getting tighter and tighter, and I can't stand it! The end of the year is approaching, and we have to slaughter a pig at home to make some preserved meat," the proprietress said angrily. Three sentences are inseparable from her profession. She always forgets "pig" when she opens her mouth, and she always likes to "slaughter" and "kill" when she opens her mouth.</p>
<p>"Business is not good. This year, we have to compromise a bit for the New Year! It would be a blessing to be able to avoid debt, let alone slaughtering any pigs," Mr. Liao said with a full heart of depression, speaking in a Sichuan accent.</p>
<p>This time, the proprietress seized the handle. She immediately went straight to the point and said with a sneer:</p>
<p>"Hehe! What does it matter if business is not good? As long as people are not sick, I am willing to lose money!"</p>
<p>"Stop being sarcastic with me! It's not that no one is sick now, it's that when other people get sick, they don't come to buy our medicine. Because they are superstitious about foreign doctors and only buy foreign medicine."</p>
<p>"Ah, so that's how it is! Then it doesn't matter even more! As long as foreign medicine can cure people's diseases, it's okay if they don't buy our medicine. Anyway, you, Mr. Liao, have always been compassionate." The proprietress said more and more sarcastically.</p>
<p>"That's the reason, so business is not good!"</p>
<p>When Mr. Liao said this, he thought that the proprietress would understand him and no longer mention the matter of slaughtering pigs for the New Year. Who knew that the proprietress would not only not understand him, but this time her face sank and she simply lost her temper.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if business is bad, that's a matter for your shop; slaughtering pigs for the New Year, that's a matter for my family; you can compromise, but I can't compromise! You are compassionate to others, you should also be compassionate to my daughter and me! I married you, not to suffer with you!"</p>
<p>"What are you thinking? Don't push me!" Mr. Liao also lost his temper. When Mr. Liao lost his temper, he would scold people in his authentic Sichuan dialect.</p>

<h3>Amidst Eager Buying from All Quarters, the US Dollar Continues to Rise; Gold Prices Also Boosted to 60,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai market continued to advance. The main driver was still the US dollar. It opened directly above the 1.9 million mark in the morning. After opening, it hovered and rose in a stable state, rising to above 1.93 million after 10 o'clock. The Bank of China allocated 330 items to the industry at a price of 1.93 million. After entering, it slightly declined, but due to the rapid advance of the US dollar, there were many arbitrageurs. At noon, it rose to 1.96 million. In the early afternoon, it was still stable. Spot transactions started, and it once rose to 1.97 million, but then it turned flat due to pressure. As a result, it closed 60,000 higher than the previous close. Gold jewelry rose to 100,080, silver taels remained flat, silver dollars rose slightly again, and the unofficial discount remained between 1.2 and 1.5 jiao.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market continues to feel the scarcity of US dollars. Various floating funds are returning, and importers are struggling endlessly. Speculators and retail investors are rushing to buy. From the initial 2,600 yuan in the early morning, it gradually rose, reaching 2,750 yuan before noon before there was a source of supply, and it briefly fell. However, at noon, it still settled at around 2,740 yuan. In the afternoon, it once rose to over 1.760 yuan, and then leveled off slightly. As a result, it continued to rise by 130. Hong Kong tickets were also boosted by 15 yuan. Indian remittances rose to 550 yuan, Hong Kong remittances to 455 yuan. There are many cotton settlements, and the US exchange rate is still nominally flat but unofficially tight.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Applications Must Be Pre-Audited</h3>
<p>In order to avoid wasting foreign exchange, the Central Bank, in addition to notifying designated banks to handle matters in accordance with regulations, requires all applications from merchants to be pre-audited by the Central Bank. If the application is not made in accordance with regulations, the sale of foreign exchange will be suspended. Regarding materials approved for import, if there is competition among merchants, the bank may reduce the amount accordingly. If purchasing materials lacking domestically, special approval may also be granted. The established measures are flexible.</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the bank, in order to manage foreign exchange prudently, the Central Bank has issued a notice to the domestic and foreign banks in this city that handle foreign exchange, requiring them to carefully consider the qualifications and uses of the foreign exchange applicant when selling foreign exchange, such as: (1) Whether the importer is a direct user, (2) If operating as a general importer, whether a contract has been concluded with the manufacturer or distributor for the import, or (3) If a distributor of imported goods, whether they have been operating for three years before the Pacific War, otherwise, a special permit from the Central Bank is required. Attention must also be paid to whether the foreign exporter accepting the ordered goods is reliable in terms of credit, and the import credit letter must include various insurance and inspection documents related to the transaction. In addition, the Central Bank requests all designated banks handling foreign exchange to pay attention to the current provisions in the import application form (Format 6A), "Guarantee that all imported goods supplied with foreign exchange or their equivalent inventory are immediately sold and used."</p>
<h3>After the Lottery, Government Bonds Decline</h3>
<p>After yesterday's lottery, the person in charge of the public debt department said that the actual situation of the bond market's rise was not to be followed, which was slightly hit. At the opening of the market yesterday, the C unified bonds fell to below 5,550 yuan. After the opening, some of the northern gang on the fifth floor closed out, and the 5,000 yuan mark was broken. The short sellers took advantage of the low price to buy in, and two major households on the seventh floor bought short positions, rising from 4,950 yuan to around 5,200 yuan. As a result, it closed 650 yuan lower than the previous close. A and B bonds fell by 300 yuan, and D and E bonds also fell by 400 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Decline in the Yarn Market Has Stopped; Trading of Raw Cotton Is Quite Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market stabilized, because the price of gold rose. Cantonese merchants bought double horse spot goods, so the prices of various large yarns rose by 20,000 to 30,000. The sales of small and medium-sized goods were stagnant, and the prices were flat. The decline in fine yarns and double yarns has stopped, but there is still no sign of a turnaround. The price of fine yarns opened by the Textile Construction Institute in recent periods has been reduced by tens of thousands each period, so the industry is cautious and temporarily does not dare to take on more.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph showed that 27-39 pounds were counted. The recent price was US$29.09, the forward price was 29.52, and the Mitterling spot price was 29.80. The transaction of raw cotton in this port continued to improve, because foreign cotton was strong, and factories such as Suzhou Su, Changzhou Dacheng, and Wuxi Qingfeng successively purchased.</p>
<h3>Stable Cloth Market in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Due to the good market conditions in Tianjin, orders for grey cloth have been placed. Therefore, 12-pound "Color Ball V Dragon Head" fine cloth is firm. There is still demand from Sichuan, Shanxi, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces for serge. Available bleached cloth is in short supply, and prices are also rising. Although cloth merchants from the Scholars' Forest area are not making large purchases, their momentum is gradually developing. The opening prices for the China Textile Company in the afternoon were average. "V Dragon" fine cloth was not available, but five other types of fine cloth were. Twenty-four types of American and Mexican cloth were added. Due to enthusiastic purchasing, allocation lists will be issued tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>U.S. Price Control Bureau Abolishes Price Controls on Pig Bristles</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 11th] The Price Control Bureau has abolished price controls on animal hair and pig bristles (except for those used for brooms). These raw materials are used domestically to manufacture brushes and brooms.</p>
<h3>Diamond Demand Increasing Worldwide, Including Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The demand for diamonds is currently quite strong in Shanghai, the Soviet Union, and Singapore, as well as in Latin America and India. Demand is more moderate in Middle Eastern countries. The United States still has a very high demand, as Americans seem quite worried about inflation. Demand is particularly strong in California due to wealthy people moving there and lower state taxes. In short, the world needs more diamonds (just like it needs more gold, silver, platinum, etc.) than can currently be supplied. As a result, prices are bound to be much higher than controlled prices.</p>
<h3>Look at the United States Today: More Money Than Goods, Nowhere to Buy</h3>
<p>Government Price Limits Force Manufacturers to Stop Production</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to Mr. Reed, a prominent American businessman who arrived in Shanghai yesterday from the United States, there is currently more money than goods in the United States, and the phenomenon of having money but nowhere to buy goods has occurred. Due to continuous labor strikes, production has been greatly affected. At the same time, because the government's price limits are too strict, merchants are voluntarily stopping production. For example, for shoes, the government's price limit is six dollars, but manufacturers are demanding an increase to ten dollars. The government has refused, and manufacturers, seeing no profit, have voluntarily stopped production. Currently, items such as shoes and shirts are extremely difficult to buy in the United States. Mr. Reed also said that although China has placed large orders with the United States, it is unlikely that they will be delivered within this year.</p>
<h3>Overseas Sales of Chinese Tea Remain Stagnant</h3>
<p>Recently, local industry peers have repeatedly sent tea samples abroad to actively promote the export of Chinese tea. It is now known that news from South America indicates that various black and green tea samples have been received and the quality of the goods is satisfactory. However, they ultimately find the price too high. According to their intentions, only if the price is between US$0.35 and $0.40 per pound would large quantities be purchased. However, local tea merchants find it difficult to part with their goods due to cost considerations. Based on the current situation, overseas sales of Chinese tea are feared to remain stagnant for the time being. As for domestic sales of floral teas, local shops are still eagerly adding stock. However, nearby areas have been affected by intermittent rains, and finished goods have not been shipped out, so demand is not as active as the previous day. However, those holding goods are still reluctant to sell, and the market remains stable and attractive.</p>
<h3>Medium Sugar Rises by 4,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was tight due to a lack of enemy-produced goods and supplies from the Taiwan Company, causing prices to rise again. In the morning, the association quoted medium-grade white sugar at 75,000 yuan for the initial spot price, then 76,000 yuan for double-packed sugar, and 6,500 yuan for single-bag sugar. In the afternoon, double-packed sugar rose to 77,000-77,500 yuan, an increase of 4,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts rose from 73,500 yuan to 77,500 yuan, an increase of over 4,000 yuan. No. 22 medium-grade white sugar was quoted at 81,000 yuan. A few dozen bags of cotton lake red sugar opened at 78,000 yuan, while dark blue sugar opened at 62,000 yuan, followed by 60,000 yuan, an increase of 4,000-5,000 yuan. The price of extracted blue sugar was 64,000-65,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal Price Drops; Coal Arrivals Have Been Very Strong Recently</h3>
<p>Sales of bituminous coal from coal factories have slowed down as most factories have reduced production after the holiday, and some factories have even stopped production. Given that the recent market price of bituminous coal has greatly exceeded the allocated price, many have entrusted coal merchants to resell it on the market, increasing supply. Furthermore, the Fuel Management Committee has approved the allocation of 5,000 metric tons of bituminous coal to coal merchants in May (including 2,500 metric tons of No. 2 Kai Ping coal dust and 2,500 metric tons of Guan Ping train coal at the same allocation price as before). Most merchants agreed to accept the above-mentioned allocation of coal, as rumors of factories receiving allocated coal through the association were rife. As a result, those holding inventory became wary of being locked in again and began to cut prices, causing the market to decline rapidly.</p>
<p>According to the Fuel Management Committee, yesterday's announcement stated that the "Henry" ship transported 9,650 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, and the British ship "Hotama Maru" transported over 10,000 tons of coal yesterday. This coal was produced by the Kai coal mine. It is expected that a large amount of coal will arrive tomorrow, which will be allocated to various state-owned and private factories in the city.</p>
<h3>Confidence Rising, Credit Easing: The Shanghai Stock Market is Extremely Smooth; Foreign Stocks Were Boosted Immediately Upon Opening</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were initially flat but then became firm. Short covering was slightly active. Major stocks were exceptionally strong, while minor stocks rose only limitedly. The trend has become promising. In the early morning, prices were low, with Wing On Cotton Mill at 5,600 yuan, American-Asia at 4,100 yuan, King Fook at 295 yuan, New Kwong at 285 yuan, and Keen Hing at 218 yuan. These low prices were quickly raised, fluctuating upwards. The market was average mid-day. Later, Cantonese investors entered the Wing On Cotton Mill market. Influenced by gold and currency, confidence rose and credit eased. As a result, Wing On Cotton Mill rose by 5%, American-Asia rose by 10%, and King Fook rose less, while New Kwong and Keen Hing rose by slightly more than 5%. Due to time constraints, cold stocks rose only slightly. Foreign stocks were boosted immediately upon opening, coinciding with the firmness of gold, currency, and Chinese stocks. As a result, the market was immediately boosted. Jardine Matheson stood firm at 12,000 yuan, and continued to rise after opening. Consequently, Jardine Matheson, British-American Tobacco, and Wheelock Marden each rose by about 10% compared to the previous closing. Minor stocks were less impressive, rising only slightly. Asia, with the lowest market price, was sought after by retail investors and rose by a remarkable 10%.</p>
<h3>Chinese Silk Stockings Shipped to the United States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Philadelphia, 11th] According to "Women's Wear Daily," silk stockings shipped from China and Japan, priced between US$3.94 and $9.95 per pair, have already been sold here in small quantities. These stockings have not been advertised. Customers can purchase them upon inquiry.</p>
<h3>Most Cocoon Exchanges Suspend Weighing; Cocoon Prices Reach Nearly 200,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>According to a prominent figure in the cocoon industry: The Wuxi spring cocoon market has been open for a week since June 3rd. Cocoon collection has been satisfactory, but cocoon prices vary depending on the quality of the cocoons. The central silk farm believed that the cocoon prices were too low, and silkworm farmers were unwilling to sell. The silk farm increased cocoon prices to maintain the cost for silkworm farmers. Cocoon exchanges also increased prices to compete for purchases, which pushed up cocoon prices. By the 8th of this month, the highest price had reached 195,000 yuan, making it impossible for cocoon exchanges to purchase, so they suspended operations. As of yesterday, two-thirds of the cocoon exchanges had suspended operations, while silkworm farmers still hoped that cocoon prices would rise further and were waiting to see what would happen. Therefore, transactions have been very rare recently. The spring cocoon market is nearing its end. It is reported that cocoon exchanges in Jiangyin and Changshu have already suspended operations.</p>
<h3>The Rice Market is Quiet in Terms of Both Arrivals and Sales; Mixed Grains and Oil Cakes Show Mixed Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw sales keeping pace with arrivals. Supply and demand were neither strong nor weak, and the situation was stable. Flour sales were stagnant, and prices were weak, down 300-400 yuan. Soybean prices were tight in the morning but eased in the afternoon. Shelled peanuts rebounded by over 1,000 yuan. Broad bean sales were sluggish, down another 1,000 yuan. Corn prices fell by 1,000 yuan. Wheat sales were still acceptable, rising another 1,000 yuan. Bran sales in rural areas were active, rebounding by 100-200 yuan. Soybean cake rose by 300-400 yuan, and oil prices also rose by over 2,000 yuan. According to rice market news, a total of over 4,000 piculs of rice, including seven types of white glutinous rice, arrived in the city. The types and quantities are as follows: White glutinous rice: 1,763 piculs; Thin rice: 929 piculs; Early rice: 65 piculs; Yang glutinous rice: 468 piculs; Du glutinous rice: 10 piculs; Wu glutinous rice: 615 piculs; White yuan: 158 piculs.</p>
<h3>Pu River Unloading Fees Are Too High; Up to 14,000 Yuan Per Ton; Barge and Truck Fees Are Not Included</h3>
<p>After foreign and seagoing vessels arrive at the Pu River, the unloading fees are often arbitrarily charged, not following regulations. Shipping companies and import and export merchants are feeling a headache over this issue. It is said that various shipping companies will petition the government to strictly regulate the fees to facilitate transportation. Regarding current unloading fees, apart from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which is relatively low, the others are high. Ordinary goods are charged up to 14,000 yuan per ton. The unloading fees of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other shipping companies are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: The unloading labor cost is 5,000 yuan per ton, calculated at 250 yuan per piece for every 100 catties. This labor cost includes the cost of opening the warehouse, moving the goods, and the upper and lower labor costs for direct entry into the warehouse. If there is no wharf to dock at, barges must be hired at 2,000 yuan per ton, calculated at a minimum of 30 tons.</p>
<p>(2) Other shipping companies: The unloading labor cost is 14,000 yuan per ton, or 700 yuan per piece, which also includes the cost of opening the warehouse, moving the goods, and the upper and lower labor costs for direct entry into the warehouse. If trucks are hired, the transportation fee is 1,500 yuan per piece, totaling 30,000 yuan per ton. If there is no wharf to dock at and barges must be hired, the cost ranges from 16,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan per ton. These labor costs apply to imported materials such as cotton and pig bristles. For mountain products and medicinal materials, an additional 50% is added to each piece, and the labor cost is 21,000 yuan per ton. The additional cost does not apply when hiring trucks or barges.</p>
<h3>Yangtzekiang Finance Corporation Shares</h3>
<p>London Market Price Gradually Improves</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The "Evening Standard" reports that the price of Yangtzekiang Finance Corporation's ordinary preferred shares has recently reached one shilling and nine pence, seemingly because the company's mining rights and other rights in China have gained value after the end of the war against Japan.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the war, the British side had an agreement with the Chinese government to establish a Sino-British joint venture to engage in mining, industry, and other businesses in Sichuan Province. However, negotiations were suspended for a long time due to the war. The company's capital is 300,140 pounds, of which 168,013 pounds has been paid up.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Official Discusses: The Rise of the U.S. Dollar is Purely Speculative</h3>
<p>Sufficient Foreign Exchange Reserves; Changing the Exchange Rate Would Only Stimulate Prices</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Recently, the exchange rate has been rising, and discussions about currency reform have been rampant. The market for U.S. dollars and gold has been rising steadily. A reporter asked a responsible official at the Central Bank about relevant issues. The official said that the bank's priority has always been to be pragmatic and focused on work, so it has consistently ignored all outside speculation and conjecture, relying only on the facts to refute all rumors. The handling of foreign exchange and gold since March is generally visible. Regarding a recent Reuters report from New York about China's currency reform, the official said it was pure nonsense, but speculators have taken it as a prelude to new foreign exchange measures and promoted it vigorously. They are unaware that the authorities have already made up their minds and that all measures will be taken to safeguard the welfare of the 450 million compatriots. Now that the soaring rice prices have just subsided, suddenly changing the exchange rate would not necessarily help export businesses, but prices would rise in response. This would be like aiding evildoers, which is unwise. As for the future of the foreign exchange market, the official, due to his position, was unwilling to express his opinion. Regarding rumors that a certain company has monopolized import trade and manipulated foreign exchange, the official said he had not heard of it and believed that no one would dare to monopolize it. He said that any accusations should be based on solid evidence, otherwise, baseless rumors would not help in any way. He believes that the recent rise in the U.S. dollar is purely speculative and unreasonable. At the beginning of the opening of the foreign exchange and gold markets, prices fluctuated according to the market, as originally stipulated. Now, the foreign exchange market has remained stable, while the gold market has changed daily. The reason for this is that the foreign exchange market implicitly reflects the external value of the legal currency. The stability of the foreign exchange market is enough to show that the value of the legal currency has remained stable externally. Gold, on the other hand, is a commodity and cannot be compared to currency. The price of goods naturally fluctuates slightly due to supply and demand. Furthermore, the world gold price has also increased slightly recently, so the local gold price has also increased slightly. As for the Central Bank's foreign exchange reserves, they are very sufficient. Since the opening of the foreign exchange market, although there have been many foreign exchange settlements from importers, remittances from overseas Chinese, frozen funds of our country abroad, and the recently successful U.S. cotton loan of over 30 million, are all sufficient to offset and exceed the settlements. Therefore, there is no fear of a shortage of foreign exchange. Finally, the official reiterated that if the authorities are going to change any major measures related to the national economy, they must carefully consider and plan thoroughly beforehand to ensure that the changes are beneficial to the public before they are implemented. Therefore, the public should not easily believe any rumors in the market and be taken advantage of by speculators.</p>

<h3>The World's Attention on the Soviet Union: Acknowledging the Existence of a Major War Crisis</h3>
<p>Special Compilation by This Newspaper's Editorial Department</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is currently the most watched country, because in the event of a Third World War (if it were to break out), it would occupy a major position.</p>
<p>We must first understand the Soviet Union's perspective. The Soviet Communist Party's official newspaper, "Pravda," recently published an article by Professor Moderev of Moscow University, stating, "There are many contradictory issues in the world today that are sufficient to cause war." This statement already indicates that the Soviet Union recognizes that the possibility of war is certain.</p>
<p>The most important section of the article states: "Now, the fact that colonies exploit yellow and black races and the attempt to force all mankind to accept the rule of Anglo-Saxon countries expose racial prejudice and clearly contain the seeds of war. There are many contradictory issues in the world today that are sufficient to cause war. Only by adopting a policy based on treaties and mutual respect for the will of the people of other countries as soon as possible can the powers avert the crisis."</p>
<p>The author's conclusion further expresses the current purpose of the Soviet Union. He warns all countries, believing that "the powers have no other way but to cooperate with the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Stalin Will Not Step Down; The Red Army Will Not Mutiny</p>
<p>On the other hand, the May issue of the "Reader's Digest" published an article explaining the inside story of the Soviet Union. Now, the important parts of that article are extracted as follows:</p>
<p>Many foreign observers believe that there is potential rebellion among the Red Army commanders, which is wishful thinking. The Red Army marshals have received training suitable for military institutions and are well-treated, but are not allowed to have political speaking rights. Marshal Zhukov is a most appropriate example. Even on minor political matters, he is not allowed to decide without instructions from Moscow. Some foreign reporters completely misunderstand the relationship between the Soviet Union and Stalin. They believe that Stalin will gradually reduce his power, but Stalin will only hand over power after his death. He is respected by the Soviet people, and if errors occur, the blame should be borne by his subordinates. Stalin's power is still supreme and unlimited, and only the thirteen members of the Political Committee can freely express their opinions to him. The Political Committee may be the only democratic institution in the Soviet Union. The most powerful person in the Political Committee is Malenkov, who has full power to handle the promotion and transfer of senior officials. Molotov does not directly participate in domestic affairs, but his international political reports are enough to influence domestic affairs.</p>
<p>Recently, many foreign observers believe that the Soviet leaders are not communists and have become nationalists. In fact, they are still full Marxists. They use nationalism as they use religion.</p>
<p>Are we about to go to war with the Soviet Union? The possibility of this war cannot be avoided. Can we cooperate with the Soviet Union? If what we call cooperation is as close as the cooperation between Britain and the United States, Britain and France, or France and Belgium, then the answer is "no." But we can have commercial relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>If Soviet policy remains unchanged, we cannot hope to have cultural and intellectual relations with them. In fact, there has never been an exchange of students between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Many military observers predict that infighting will occur in the Soviet Union after Stalin's death. Stalin and the Politburo have paid close attention to this. After Stalin's death, power will remain in the Politburo.</p>
<p>The burdens that the current Soviet leaders place on the people are heavier than those of other people, but these leaders have led the Soviet Union to victory. Now, what they hope for is security and a better life.</p>
<p>Military Officer Sent to the Soviet Union; The Subtle Relationship Between the United States and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Amidst the tensions in U.S.-Soviet relations, Smith has succeeded Harriman as the envoy to the Soviet Union. Can he improve relations between the two countries? The views of "International Digest" on this issue are worth our attention. "International Digest" writes:</p>
<p>The key figures in the U.S. State Department unanimously believe that the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union is the most important diplomatic outpost for the United States. What happens in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow over the next two years is enough to influence world trends over the next twenty years. Whether the friendly relations between the United States and the Soviet Union are strengthened or weakened largely depends on the development trends of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The mission of ambassadors in history is probably not greater than what Smith shoulders today.</p>
<p>Diplomatic circles are certainly very clear that Smith's mission is to promote understanding and friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union, but some people are skeptical, wondering how the Soviet Union can be understood when the United States places Eisenhower's most promising successor at the doorstep of the Kremlin? If one wants to promote world peace, one must first eliminate all military measures that may cause suspicion. What is the purpose of the United States sending a military officer to head the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union? Why not replace Smith immediately with an experienced civilian official like Wallace?</p>
<p>These questions can be answered immediately from the U.S. Army and Navy Country Club in Washington. Military figures who are familiar with Smith say that he is best suited for this position because speaking to the Soviets requires a frank and resolute attitude, which is unique to Smith. In fact, Smith has a very harmonious relationship with the top Soviet military officers.</p>
<p>But there will always be a subtle relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. Smith's predecessor, Harriman, was unable to resolve various disputes during his tenure in the Soviet Union. Therefore, Washington's diplomatic circles are watching Harriman's successor with skeptical eyes. Their concern has not diminished since Smith began his mission.</p>
<p>President Truman believes that Smith is best suited to perform this task of promoting friendly relations because Smith is familiar with the style of military diplomats during World War II. Someone once suggested to Smith that the United States should announce the State Department's criticism of the Soviet Union to the world. Smith solemnly replied, "We want to negotiate with the Soviet Union, not criticize the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Since Smith took office as the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, "Helmet Diplomacy" has become a topic of attention in Washington. It is not that Washington officials doubt Smith's determination to carry out a peaceful mission, but what some sensitive observers are concerned about is this: the whole world is painstakingly trying to jump out of the waters of war. Would it not be better if the United States could send a non-military envoy to the Soviet Union?</p>
<h3>Stalin, Do It to the End</h3>
<h3>Ten Warriors</h3>
<p>— Originally published in the British "Sunday Express," translated by Jia Nan</p>
<p>——Saving Human Lives—— Destroying the Nazi Atomic Nest</p>
<p>If Germany had invented the atomic bomb before the Allied forces in World War II, what impact would it have had on the outcome of the war? What would the world look like today? To say that Germany could have turned defeat into victory might be sensational and exaggerated. However, London and Moscow, the two crucial fortresses of resistance in Europe, would have undoubtedly been the first to be turned to ashes like Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Even Washington across the Atlantic and China's wartime capital, Chongqing, would likely have been spared. However, why didn't Germany invent the atomic bomb? Was their scientific and technological level insufficient? Did German scientists not think of this possibility? Neither of these were the reason. I believe there are two primary reasons for Germany's failure in this area. First, many German scientists, especially many talented German-Jewish scientists, were unwilling to serve the Nazis, who killed without batting an eye. The direction of people's hearts has its own divine justice! Second, the necessary raw materials for manufacturing the atomic bomb were destroyed by Allied special forces. The following is a thrilling story about this significant event, called the "Heavy Water" Raid.</p>
<p>What is "heavy water"? "Heavy water" is a necessary raw material for manufacturing the atomic bomb; its scientific name is Deuterium Oxide. What is the "Heavy Water" Raid? From the words themselves, it can be seen that it is an attack on the place where "heavy water" is manufactured. Originally, within Germany proper and throughout the German-occupied territories, only the Norsk Hydro plant in Vemork, Norway, produced this extremely precious chemical substance during the war. In May 1940, the British received disturbing intelligence that Germany had ordered the plant to increase "heavy water" production to 3,000 pounds per year; by mid-1942, they demanded an increase to 10,000 pounds.</p>
<p>In July 1942, the British Cabinet advocated attacking Vemork and doing so quickly. In wartime, time is of the essence. Two officers and two corporals were immediately selected from the Norwegian Army, and the team was codenamed "Swallow." At 11:30 PM on October 15, 1942, they parachuted into the mountainous area east of Fjellereppe. Once the initial work was successful, the British would send a glider team to retrieve them.</p>
<p>The difficult terrain of Norway is world-renowned, with mountains and valleys everywhere, and in winter, the whole country turns into a silvery world of white snow. These four Norwegian soldiers fought hard against the various difficulties of nature. Their loyal and patriotic hearts for the survival of their motherland and the victory of the United Nations finally overcame countless hardships and obtained invaluable intelligence.</p>
<p>On November 19, two aircraft towing two gliders took off from a base in Scotland. Unfortunately, one aircraft and two gliders crashed near the Norwegian coast. As a result, they had to start from scratch and train another special attack team of six men. The development of events is often not linear but curved.</p>
<p>The "Swallow" team waited patiently. At midnight on February 16, 1943, six Norwegian soldiers landed on the frozen Lake Skriken, 30 miles northwest of the "Swallow" team's location. In Norway, walking 30 miles in winter is more difficult than walking 300 miles in a temperate zone. However, with iron will, the two sides finally made contact.</p>
<p>Speed is essential in war. The date when the two teams joined up was February 21, and the date of the attack was also February 21. Here, two points should be particularly emphasized: (1) Although the total number of men in the two teams was only ten, the decisive nature of their mission was no less than that of a battleground with thousands of troops; (2) Fighting on a formal battlefield can embolden even the timid, but operating in enemy-occupied territory with a small number of personnel, traversing desolate mountains and snow-covered lands, to carry out a mission with no certainty of success, requires even greater alertness and courage.</p>
<p>The two teams departed from their base at 8:00 PM. They stopped 500 meters from the factory gate and waited until 12:30 AM before cautiously crawling forward. Based on prior intelligence, the team leader sent one person to open two unguarded iron gates. Although the gates were locked, they were easily pushed open after being cut with military-grade wire cutters. Upon command, the cover team and demolition team followed. The second task was to destroy the electrolytic plant. However, the outer doors of the factory building were closed even more tightly, and they could not force their way in. The only way in was through the underground tunnel. Time was of the essence, so they filed in one by one. Inside the tunnel, lead pipes crisscrossed, making movement very difficult. Suddenly, looking towards the opposite window, they saw a dark shadow flash by; this was the guard, their immediate enemy! With a "crash," the window was smashed, and the guard, caught off guard, was captured on the spot. Once this obstacle was overcome, the team leader immediately began to lay explosives, set the fuse, and the entire team retreated at once, hiding 20 yards away, listening for good news. As expected, there was a deafening explosion that shook the earth. This explosion destroyed about 3,000 pounds of "heavy water"!</p>
<p>Order inside the factory was momentarily disrupted. The guards who had been guarding the front gate also rushed in, but the attackers took this opportunity to slip out through the front gate!</p>
<p>Good heavens! Even the German commander-in-chief in Norway said: "This attack is the only one of its kind I have ever seen in my life."</p>
<p>From then on, the Germans became uneasy. The factory负责人repeatedly requested the German side to transport the machinery and remaining "heavy water" to Germany. However, this was a significant matter, and the German side could not immediately make a decision. However, the increasingly tense situation forced the German side to finally decide to relocate.</p>
<p>This news was obtained again by the Allied special forces, who immediately reported it to their superiors in England. The order retrieved by the wartime cabinet was: "Regardless of anything, the equipment for manufacturing 'heavy water' and the already manufactured 'heavy water' must be destroyed; they must not be allowed to leave the country."</p>
<p>At that time, only five members of the special forces remained in Norway, but the work still had to be done. At the same time, the German defenses became increasingly tight, with guards stationed almost every five steps along the railway line. However, for some unknown reason, no guards were stationed on the transport ship carrying this important cargo. It was truly a case of "destiny is difficult to defy," leaving people speechless! The Allied special forces found this weakness and, while the sailors were playing poker in the ship's hold, planted a time bomb. After the ship had sailed about a thousand miles from port, it exploded with a roar, and as a result, 3,600 gallons of "heavy water" and all the machinery were buried at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>"Why didn't Germany have an atomic bomb?" The story above explains one of the many reasons.</p>
<h3>Rare News: The Trade in Human Heads</h3>
<p>When the writer was residing in Quito, Ecuador, South America, one night I woke up in a hotel room and suddenly caught sight of a person holding a woman's head, placing it in front of me, while whispering in a rough voice: "Sir! Sir! Only fifty dollars, very cheap!" You can imagine that my shock at that time was extraordinary.</p>
<p>The head was indeed that of a young woman, as could be determined by her long, black, beautiful hair. The local Indians there are accustomed to removing the bones from human heads, shrinking them to a quarter of their original size, and selling them to white people as a commodity. South America has many mysterious things, and this "shrunken head" is the most mysterious of all!</p>
<h3>Replacing an Old Heart with a New Heart</h3>
<p>Recently, a Soviet scientist has successfully experimented with "heart transplantation." This news has shocked the world's medical community. Recently, Dr. Sinitsyn, a scientist at the Gorky Institute of Experimental Medicine in Moscow, succeeded in experimenting with "heart transplantation," further attracting the attention of the medical community. Sinitsyn used frogs for the experiment because frogs have the simplest hearts.</p>
<p>After Sinitsyn's successful experiment with frogs, he further experimented with warm-blooded animals such as cats, dogs, and rabbits, whose hearts are quite similar to human hearts. Sinitsyn's plan is to create replacement hearts for human use, preparing to attach a second, stronger heart when the original heart weakens. The ultimate goal is to achieve heart transplantation, attaching the heart externally and removing the original heart after it functions well. The success of this matter still depends on the future, but the hope of success is great. If so, human lifespan can be extended considerably.</p>
<h3>The Vatican and the Kremlin Have Reached the Point of Close Combat</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xi Jie from Newsweek</p>
<p>Europe was once the world of Catholicism, but nowadays Europeans are pursuing not ideals but reality. With the end of the war, the Vatican is facing one of the most serious problems in history. Pope Pius XII watched millions of starving people being swallowed up by the Soviet invasion forces, becoming increasingly worried. Now it has reached the period of close combat between religion and politics. The power of the Roman Catholic Church has begun to extend into the vortex of politics.</p>
<p>In the past year, Pope Pius XII has delivered more than 25 speeches, urging the world's 33.8 million Catholics to stand firm in their faith, unite, and fight to the death against the materialism and secularism of communist countries. On May 12, the Pope delivered a speech to more than 40,000 Italian women, addressing the Italian elections on June 2, urging them to elect candidates who can respect God and religion, and not to elect leftist figures. Two days later, the New York Communist Party newspaper "Daily Worker" published an article accusing the Pope of participating in the Italian election movement.</p>
<p>The conflict between Catholicism and communism has a long history, but it has become more acute today. In the past year, the Vatican and the Kremlin have repeatedly retorted each other with sharp words in each new strategy they launched, revealing their sharp edges. Last December, the Pope announced the election of 32 cardinals from countries around the world, stating that the Church should be transnational and should no longer be solely presided over by the Italian people. The Soviet "Izvestia" immediately published an article attacking this move, pointing out that the election of cardinals was an action by the Vatican to spread "reactionary" forces to countries around the world, attempting to enhance the prestige of the Roman Catholic Church in democratic countries.</p>
<p>Pope Pius XII of Rome is approaching the age of seventy and has always hated communism throughout his life. During his twelve years of residence in Germany, he strongly opposed communism and was once targeted for assassination by the Red Army without success. Recently, the Pope has shown tolerance towards the Franco government because the Spanish government allows people religious freedom. Church members deeply believe that if Franco steps down at this time, it will cause civil unrest in Spain, and civil unrest would create an opportunity for the Communist Party.</p>

<h3>An Adventure in Lincheng</h3>
<p>— Qiao Zi</p>
<p>Lincheng was besieged by the Chinese Communists (New Fourth Army) for eight months. This fierce attack by 120,000 Communist troops not only failed to gain an advantage, but also resulted in the sacrifice of more than 20,000 men. Following Lincheng, they suddenly attacked Zaozhuang, with the aim of eliminating the vulnerable corner of Lincheng. After trapping the city in isolation, they planned to use their usual tactic of destroying it piece by piece. Little did they know that they would run into another brick wall. They could only gather their defeated troops and besiege Lincheng and Zaozhuang. During this time, I traveled between Lincheng and Xuzhou three times, each time being subjected to repeated inspections and suffering many unpleasant words and mental insults! In their "peace zone," one could only swallow their anger and try to smile more, otherwise, you couldn't expect to pass through.</p>
<p>This time, we were demobilized. Due to the more tense situation than before, grain transport was denied two or three times, so many of our comrades dared not leave and waited for a chance to speak again. I, regardless, set off with two comrades on a risky journey, acting as pioneers.</p>
<p>At 6:00 AM on May 31, we departed from Lincheng. We hired a peasant to carry our luggage. There were two roads to Jizhuang. I took the highway near the railway, and the other two took the rural road. Before we had gone three miles, I discovered a local Communist unit. They entered the village and did not come out for a long time. I knew something was wrong. Fear was useless, so I ran to the village and asked others. They said they were conducting inspections inside. I went inside and was locked in a small hut (detained separately, unable to see each other). I felt suffocated in the hut! I kept peeking outside to see if there were any changes, preparing for the worst. Suddenly, a fierce-looking person with a pistol and unkempt appearance came and asked me where I was going and if I had official business. I said I was a demobilized officer from Lincheng going to Xuzhou, and my official business was a pass from the division headquarters. He also asked for my demobilization and retirement certificates and said that official business could not pass through the "peace zone," and even a three-person group with official business was invalid. What should I do? At that time, I couldn't figure out his intentions. He talked to me about "democracy," how the Communists and Nationalists were... how Jiang and Mao were... It was simply absurd, selling his fake Tongrentang plaster! He advised me not to go home and to work there, saying it was the same thing. After I repeatedly stated that I would not be a soldier and would go home to be an ordinary person, he left in anger!</p>
<p>Soon, another person came and talked a great deal of philosophy. One after another, it was the same routine. I got along quite well with one named Cao. To be friendly, he asked me for a pair of leather shoes. Soon, others found out and came to ask for things, so I had to painfully sacrifice. In an instant, my fountain pen, watch, towel, safety razor, shirt, shorts, etc., were no longer mine! They whispered to each other for a while and said to me that the Eighth Route Army didn't want things but had to be given money. In the end, I settled the matter by paying several thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they brought my two comrades over and made a mess of our luggage, ordering us to pack it up and send it to the Shagou district headquarters. I wondered what new tricks they had in store. A few minutes later, we were singing "Male Escort"! When we arrived at the district headquarters, they still repeated the same routine as before, performing a magic trick. At that time, we were hungry and exhausted, and seeing that it was getting dark, we were extremely anxious, feeling as if we were "homeless in the afterlife, where will we stay tonight?"</p>
<p>Soon, District Chief Li returned and questioned us in detail again, allowing us to pass, ordering us to spend the night in the next village. We thanked him profusely and came out, still instructing the hired man to carry the luggage. On the road, we encountered batch after batch of armed local Communists. We said we were from the district headquarters and were going to the village ahead. Fortunately, they didn't ask for protection money, otherwise, our military uniforms and quilts wouldn't have been safe!</p>
<p>When we arrived at the village, we discussed and pleaded with the village chief, who allowed us to stay overnight in a thatched hut with air on all sides. We also bought a few steamed buns and a bowl of millet porridge to fill our stomachs. The next morning, as soon as dawn broke, we were urged to get up. The hired man told us to cross Weishan Lake to Liguo Station, where there were no inspections by the Communist or Nationalist armies. But I was afraid of going to "Liangshan Marsh" and encountering Li Jun, the River Dragon, who would invite us to eat wontons and sword noodles. Losing our luggage was a small matter; losing our lives would be a tragedy, so I didn't dare to try. I still decided to take the highway. We passed through three checkpoints to Hanzhuang. When we reached the final警戒线, I thought we could pass, but a dozen or so bandit-like plainclothes armed comrades came up to us, equipped with machine guns, pistols, rifles, sabers, spears, etc. They yelled, asked our intentions, inspected our luggage, and then escorted us to the battalion headquarters. Two armed soldiers came and detained us separately, so we became prisoners again! In less than ten minutes, we were moved to another place of detention. This happened more than ten times, making us dizzy and feeling both amused and helpless. During this time, people kept coming to persuade us, but we ignored them all, suffering a foreign torment all night long in suspense!</p>
<p>The next day, they took me out for interrogation. The person asking the questions was probably a political instructor. After more than an hour, they asked if I was a student of Chairman Jiang. I replied that I came from the military and didn't understand anything. But he suddenly became solemn and said that my comrade was too disrespectful to friends. Why did he steal the meeting minutes! He put the blame of being a Nationalist agent on my head and demanded that I tell the truth immediately, otherwise, he would use the most severe methods to deal with me and押去“开火花” (take me away and torture me with hot irons). Hearing this, I felt as if cold water had been poured over my head. Who could bear it? I explained in detail the situation from the time we departed from Lincheng and passed through Shagou, and he began to half-believe me, still ordering me to be detained. At this time, my heart couldn't help but beat nervously. After fighting for eight years against the Japanese, I hadn't been killed by them, but now I was going to die at the hands of the Eighth Route Army. Wouldn't that be too unjust! But what could I do at this point? I could only leave it to fate. After three hours of mixed thoughts, I still couldn't find a way to comfort myself. At the same time, I put my life out of my mind and was ready to be killed or tortured.</p>
<p>At this time, a comrade came up very kindly and asked me to go outside to talk. I followed him to the office and saw my comrade sitting there, smoking leisurely. My heart suddenly felt relieved. I asked him the reason. When the local Communists in Jizhuang inspected our luggage, he accidentally dropped the meeting minutes inside. In his hurry, he didn't have time to check carefully, causing this two-day danger! Fortunately, they called and asked very clearly, otherwise, I would have probably gone to my grandma's house to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival! After about another hour or so, the interrogating political instructor brought more than a dozen comrades out and repeatedly said, "Sorry! Sorry! Trouble, trouble!" He told us to sit down and talked for a long time about灌碱政治作用(infusing us with alkaline political ideology). Then he sent us to the battalion gate. Saying goodbye, we wiped away our sweat and hurriedly walked across the wooden bridge over the canal, entering our警戒内(patrolled area). My comrade and I couldn't help but jump up and down, cheering wildly, eight feet high, tears of joy falling down. Whew, we escaped! We were back in our safe embrace.</p>
<h3>I Saw Jiang Weiguo</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>I often saw the name of Major Jiang Weiguo in the newspapers. During the fierce battles in India and Burma, his reputation was even greater. After the victory, he led his troops to Shanghai and temporarily驻扎(stationed) at the original site of Shanghai University in Yangshupu. The students all hoped to see the true face of this young hero.</p>
<p>Finally, Jiang Weiguo and his wife came to attend Shanghai University's weekly meeting on June 3. To the rhythm of a lively march, he and his wife walked into the auditorium and sat in the first row below the stage.</p>
<p>When President Ling invited him to speak, amidst the enthusiastic applause of the students, he stood up from his chair, but because the doors on both sides leading to the stage were not open, he was in a dilemma. Afterwards, he himself said: "I thought President Ling wanted to test me and let me climb onto the stage!"</p>
<p>Indeed, Major Jiang Weiguo was a very humorous person. After he took the stage, he first introduced himself: "My surname is Jiang, my name is Weiguo, the 'wei' of 经纬(longitude and latitude), the 'guo' of 国家(country), and I am the少校(major) of the First Detachment of the Chinese Armored Corps Training General Team." He was straightforward and not arrogant, and his clear and fluent Mandarin made the students admire him even more.</p>
<p>Then, as a soldier, he introduced us to some new military knowledge. He had a very detailed explanation of the origin of the name "tank," the general situation of armored兵 training, and the Yining incident in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>When he was saying that China urgently needed to train armored兵 talents, he immediately turned back to President Ling and explained: "Please forgive me, I am not advertising to solicit business." There was a burst of laughter from the audience.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the students were reluctant to leave and followed them, especially Jiang Weiguo's wife, who became the focus of the female students' attention. She nodded and thanked them with a smile. It is said that by the time the students got their cameras from the dormitory, they had already gotten into the car and left. It was a real pity!</p>
<h3>Four Poems on the Three Martyrs of the Late Ming Dynasty, with Preface</h3>
<p>After the ravages of war, I happened to find Su Zigu's collected works in an old chest. Reading about the deaths of Zhang Jiayu, Chen Bangyan, and Chen Zizhuang, all loyal gentlemen who died for their principles, my heart was filled with fervent emotions and tears streamed down my face. Therefore, I took up my brush to record this, hoping to reveal even a fraction of their heroic deeds.</p>
<p>Iron armor and golden spears, a divine steed of yellow. Jiayu often rode a yellow horse, a swift and agile steed. Every time he faced battle, amidst the bleak wind and sand, it would rear up and neigh fiercely to boost the morale of the troops. When Jiayu died, a loyal man following him to the battlefield, the horse also threw itself into the water beside Yuanxi.</p>
<p>His voice remained strong even after death, his cries echoing in the setting sun and sandy winds of the desolate marsh. Jiayu fought at Zengcheng, his isolated army without reinforcements. Unwilling to be stained by enemy blood, he threw himself into a marsh to die.</p>
<p>The cross-river strategy came to naught, the remnants of the Central Plains were difficult to manage. His ambition did not die, but his body was shattered first. His liver and gall could still strike at treacherous officials. Bangyan was executed by dismemberment. Those who supervised the execution saw his liver suddenly leap up and strike the supervisor's face, causing him to be startled and die within a few days.</p>
<p>His ambition to conquer the passes and rivers in a hundred battles had not been fulfilled. Besieged in the city, he became fish on a chopping board. Fortunately, there was a brush for writing poetry in his iron-barred window. His verses were filled with fervent emotions. Bangyan was arrested and refused to eat the food offered to him. For five days in prison, he only chanted poems. If paper was given to him, he would fill it immediately. Among the poems circulated were these lines: "Great creation, many hardships, alas, the time does not favor me! Where shall my empress go? My body is in bitter suffering!" The sorrow and despair were so intense that one could not bear to finish reading.</p>
<p>The rolling warships surged upstream, leaving behind the regret of lost rivers and mountains on the suspicious boats. His solitary integrity, like a piece of Zhuzhou moon, illuminated the eternal sorrows of the human world. Bangyan lay in ambush in the reeds of Zhuzhou, waiting for Li Chengdong's fleet to arrive. He led his boats out to engage them briefly, burning several of their ships. Chengdong retreated westward, and Bangyan pursued him. At dusk, Chen Zizhuang could not distinguish the colors of the flags and suspected they were all enemy boats. The formation wavered, and Chengdong, with the wind at his back, pursued and inflicted a great defeat.</p>

<h3>"British Excrement" "American Retreat Turns Coy"</h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>Seeing "printer's errors" in newspapers reminded me of a few old stories. Before the war, a newspaper in Guangzhou reported the arrival of the British ambassador in Hankou. The headline in large characters, "British Ambassador Arrives in Hankou," was mistakenly printed as "British Excrement Arrives in Hankou," which shocked readers. This was indeed a remarkable and ironic "printer's error."</p>
<p>On the eve of the Pacific War, the United States had not yet made a decision to go to war with Japan but frequently exerted pressure on Japan. It once issued an order to evacuate American residents from Japan. A newspaper in Hong Kong mistakenly printed the sub-headline "American Evacuation" as "American Retreat Turns Coy." The mistake was quite charming, as the "retreat" at the time did indeed have the diplomatic posture of a "withdrawal."</p>
<p>In 1943, the Hong Kong Libao was edited by Ye Lingfeng, who was in charge of "Yan Lin." At that time, a writer who had collaborated with the enemy expressed remorse. Ye wrote a short article in "Yan Lin" saying that if this person could truly repent and start anew, we should certainly not hold past offenses against them and welcome them with open arms. The printer mistakenly printed the word "arms" as "buttocks," and for a time, it was rumored that someone was "opening their buttocks to welcome" someone else. This was truly a blunder, bordering on the absurd.</p>
<p>A visitor came from Kunming, and in jest described the street scenes with four-character phrases. They were so vivid and apt that they were worth sharing:</p>
<p>Towering buildings of Nanping Street, bright and tidy Jinbi Road, the hustle and bustle of Zhengyi Road, spacious and flat Huguo Road, strangely Europeanized Xiaodong Street, beggars swarming in Tuodong Road, small and exquisite Tongren Street, luxurious restaurants lining Yongdao Street, filthy and cramped Shulin Street, rough and uneven Jiexiao Lane, the stench of Jinniu Street, rows of incense sticks on Qingyun Street, the mooing of cows and neighing of horses on Zhuji Street, street stalls occupying Wenming Street, the rural flavor of Wenque Street, dust flying on Huancheng Road, a riot of flowers near Jinri Building, the antique charm of Jinbi Fang, night market snacks on Yuxi Street, the cool breeze on the Cuihu Causeway.</p>
<h3>On "Zijuan"</h3>
<p>— Cao Zuohan</p>
<p>Some enthusiasts of "Dream of the Red Chamber" compared Xue Baochai to Zeng Guofan and Lin Daiyu to Zuo Zongtang. And some meddling, idle literati wanted to elevate Xue Baochai to be the wife of Duke Wenzheng; this is truly a busybody's thought. Attraction between the sexes and repulsion between the same sex not only conforms to physics but also to human nature. Can people with the same character necessarily be together, and can those with the same circumstances necessarily sympathize with each other? Only because she is one of the heroines are there so many unreasonable complaints. I think there is a little maid in "Dream of the Red Chamber" who can indeed captivate the heart and make people admire her example. She is Zijuan.</p>
<p>If I were to draw a comparison, I would say: she is very much like Marquis Wu, Zhuge Liang.</p>
<p>It is said that she was originally a maid in the Jia family and later became Lin Daiyu's personal maid. This was also in accordance with Grandmother Jia's arrangement and instructions, and she was wholeheartedly loyal. Although she did not have Marquis Wu's talent to conquer the south and pacify the north, "dedicating herself to the task until her dying day," she would test with lies, receive blame, and forget herself, sharing both joy and sorrow. Until "the bitter Crimson Pearl's soul returned to the Heaven of Sorrow," she finally cut off her three thousand strands of hair to become a nun following the Fourth Young Mistress. In this, she had finally fulfilled her ambition to "die only after achieving her goal." If it were someone else, taking advantage of Bao Er's lingering affection, she would have long climbed onto a higher branch. Only Zhuge Liang would have been loyal to the helpless A Dou until death.</p>
<p>Someone might say, "The Dao is lost, seek it in the countryside." It is only because there is only a pair of clean stone lions in the Jia family that her nobility is highlighted. This is certainly true. Like the so-called daughters of noble families today, their moral fiber is perhaps lighter than pre-war history books. On the contrary, women from humble families, without much learning, have not forgotten all the principles of integrity and righteousness.</p>
<p>However: are there still people like Zijuan today? If there are, even if they are humble servants, I would be willing to serve them.</p>
<h3>Champion of Childhood Fitness, Now Crowned Beauty Queen</h3>
<p>— Han Yun</p>
<p>Ms. Eileen Kahill, an American girl, participated in a children's health competition at the age of three and won first place.</p>
<p>Now, sixteen years later, her healthy physique has remained unchanged, and her beauty has made her famous in the world. In the recent "beauty pageant" in the United States, Kahill won first place.</p>
<p>This is what is meant by "what a child is at three, he will be all his life." Fitness always remains fitness.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Unafraid of Rain</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Chemists have recently discovered a substance that allows hot asphalt to adhere to wet surfaces. Asphalt originally loses its adhesive force when it comes into contact with water, but after being treated with this substance, it can firmly bond with sand and gravel. Therefore, even when it is raining heavily, this mixture can be used to pave roads. In the past, there was no way to repair roads in rainy weather. Because if the road-building materials are damp, the adhesive force will be greatly reduced, and the road surface paved with wet materials will easily crack and peel off. Therefore, road construction had to be suspended when it rained and continue when the weather cleared.</p>
<p>This new substance is a liquid that can be added in small quantities during asphalt refining or during application. With this substance, not only will newly built roads not be affected by wind and rain, but also work and expenses will be saved by avoiding delays while waiting for clear weather. This is a significant contribution to road administration.</p>
<p>Collected Snippets</p>
<h3>Mocking the Elderly in the Miss Hong Kong Competition</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>Remembering Zhu Shaoping, I recall an old incident. Twenty years ago, I attended a gathering wearing a hat. Mr. Zhu, who was acting as a receptionist, specifically came over and asked me very politely if I wanted him to put away my hat for me. I then realized that I had not taken off my hat, and my face turned red. I was very ashamed at the time.</p>
<p>Hong Kong held a beauty pageant, competing for the title of Miss Hong Kong. Women of sixty years old could also participate, all required to wear swimsuits. This is simply making fun of the elderly.</p>
<p>A young woman's body was found floating beneath Baozhe Bridge in Wuxi. It was later learned that the deceased was named Chang Dong'e, from Suzhou. She had received a secondary education. Because her brother had served as a puppet district chief during the enemy-puppet period and had recently been arrested and sentenced, Dong'e was ashamed and sought death. Previously, there was the case of the woman who betrayed China (Shen Guiqin) seeking a divorce. Now, there is the sister of a traitor committing suicide by drowning. The two women have different goals, but the underlying cause is the same. However, the traitors themselves are often shameless during their trials, putting on an ugly performance and claiming credit. How thick is their skin?</p>
<p>Li Zewen, the general manager of the New New Company, was sentenced to three years in prison, and all his property was confiscated. He did not express much in court, only lightly saying "Okay." This one word "Okay" contains so many meanings: suffering, hatred, regret... It is truly, "another kind of taste in my heart."</p>
<p>Reading requires strong memorization, and learning dialects also requires strong memorization. Although I have traveled through seven or eight provinces, I can never learn to speak the local dialects properly. It is especially inconvenient in Hong Kong. Helpless, I can only use various idioms to memorize things, such as "haircut" being "illegal," or instructing the driver to drive straight ahead by saying "a deer," or "where" being "Bing Shu"... It is like a beginner learning English and using Chinese phonetic transcriptions in the textbook. Although clumsy, I am still able to remember a few Cantonese phrases to this day because of this. In addition, if friends' telephone numbers are only recorded in a diary, thinking that one can rely on it without worry, it is still better to memorize them. Otherwise, one has to flip through the book every time one needs to use them, which is not a good solution.</p>
<h3>Social Services: Answering Readers</h3>
<p>Medical and Health</p>
<p>(1) Li Jianqing from Chuansha asks if you can help with a few medical questions. (1) Three years ago, I developed a strange itch on the back of my left hand with small blisters. After squeezing them, the area becomes inflamed and never scabs. The nails of my thumb and index finger have a greasy, ash-like appearance. I have asked others, and they say it is goose palm fungus. Is there any effective medicine or injection? (2) I have been married for eight years, and gave birth to a boy in the first year. However, I have not conceived since. In the 31st year, my wife learned to ride a bicycle and accidentally fell, causing pain. Her uterus often bleeds, and her menstrual cycle is irregular. I wonder if there is any danger? (3) Is there any effective medicine for premature ejaculation? Are the topical medications on the market effective? How about injecting Yokene?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] (1) It may be eczema. Consult a dermatologist. (2) Frequent uterine bleeding and irregular menstruation may be caused by uterine polyps or endometritis. A gynecologist should be consulted for a uterine examination. (3) There is no effective medicine for premature ejaculation. It is necessary to control sexual desire and do physical exercise. Most topical medications on the market are ineffective and harmful. Yokene injections should not be used indiscriminately and must be determined after a doctor's examination. (2) Hu Jianxiong asks. I am a 17-year-old male. Due to masturbation, my penis has become small and sometimes I have nocturnal emissions. Doctor, is there any way to restore my youth? It would be an immense merit. Also, the left testicle sometimes protrudes and swells. Is there any way to treat it?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] The first thing to do is to stop masturbation and prevent nocturnal emissions. Pay attention to the following points: (1) Do not overeat or drink too much in the evening. (2) The bedding should not be too heavy or thick. (3) Sleep on your side. (4) Do physical exercise. Occasional protrusion and swelling of the left testicle may be epididymitis. You should consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Ziju asks: My sister lives in Pingshi, northern Guangdong. Before the victory, she lived in the deep mountains for several months to avoid the war, and she developed a goiter. The symptom is swelling of the neck. According to the local Western doctor, it is an enlargement of the thyroid gland, caused by the lack of iodine in the water there. Therefore, all the residents there suffer from this disease, which is very unsightly. It is said that women, children, and those with irritable temperaments are more likely to get this disease, and eating more fish can prevent the spread of this disease because fish contains iodine. However, it must be iron ore fish. Originally, the water in northern Guangdong does not contain iodine, and there is no saltwater fish. Therefore, I am specifically seeking a method or medicine, or effective prescription for treating this disease. I think there is no shortage of famous doctors in Shanghai. I hope you will generously give me your advice so that my sister can get rid of the disease. I would be very grateful.</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] It is indeed goiter. You can eat more foods containing iodine, or undergo X-ray irradiation, or have surgery.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Family of Martyr Chen Wenqi, Sun Bingtao's Letter Reporting the Heroic Death</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: My classmate, Chen Wenqi (Chen Yangqing), was from Shanghai. He graduated from a senior vocational school in this city and worked for the China Science Company on Foch Road. After the outbreak of the August 13th Anti-Japanese War, he and I went to the rear and enlisted in the 15th Regiment of the Military Police. Unfortunately, in the autumn of the 32nd year, when the Japanese invaded Langguang, he died on the battlefield. At that time, because the Anti-Japanese War had not yet been won, it was inconvenient to send a letter to his family. Now that the homeland has been restored, I have been transferred back to my hometown. I specifically visited his family, but I did not meet them and could not find out their whereabouts. Therefore, I am specifically writing to your newspaper to have it published, so that his family members or relatives and friends can come to my place in person to tell the story of Chen's heroic death. Then not only will his family members be extremely grateful, but Chen will also be able to rest in peace. (Reader Sun Bingtao, Correspondence address: Please forward to Mr. Shen Weimin, telephone 42001.)</p>
