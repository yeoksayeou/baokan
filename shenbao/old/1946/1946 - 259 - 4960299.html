<h3>大量軍備運往佳木斯　哈埠共軍開始撤退　準備將松花江大橋炸毀</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十五日電〕哈市共軍已準備破壞松花江大鐵橋，連日派小江船四五十隻，將鐵橋基身四面，用鐵鑽擊成深達經尺之圓孔，中實炸藥，準備隨時破壞·又共軍日來用大車將彈藥及重要軍用品，運往哈市東九十里之賓縣，其用意未明，共軍在哈市內，現巳實行「鬥爭」淸算」。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京十五日電〕在國車向延安與張家口閒，以楔形姿態推進聲中，哈滙共軍，亦已開始向東北之佳木斯撤退，松花江鐵橋已準備予以炸毁，佳木斯或將爲東北共黨之新總部</p>
<p>〔路透社南京十五日電〕杜聿明將軍已抵牯嶺，向蔣主席報吿東北局勢，近傳東北共軍積極備戰，並在西安子（譯音）築大飛機塲。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平十五日電〕美陸軍某軍官，在東北國共兩軍轄區作廣泛遊歴已畢，今日返抵北平稱：東北「確係火藥筒」，內戰必將在「下雪之前」重行爆發，東北氣候業已轉冷。當華北政府軍攻勢激烈之際，東北保安司令杜聿明飛牯嶺向蔣主席報吿東北戰局一事，東北方面認爲意義頗爲重大，近來東北戰事雖以斷續發生之小衝突爲限，但雙方均已大事調防軍隊，重佈陣地，準備一戰，預料戰事將長春哈埠間半途之松花橋頭堡上爆發·國軍屢圖重造松花江大橋，每次開工，均遭對江共軍砲轟，松花江與哈埠間拉林河一帶，共軍已建造防禦工事，以備阻遏國軍，哈埠若遭正面攻擊，共軍不致防守，現共軍確從哈埠將大量配備運往哈埠東北二百哩山區之佳木斯。哈埠係林彪司令部所在地及東北第二大都市，「情狀異常寗靜而空虛」。同時，從北平至松花江鐵路綫一帶，共軍遊擊隊已準備攻擊此政府入東北之唯一生命綫，政府在此鐵路綫上之防務，因延綿遙長，未免薄弱，易遭襲擊。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕關係方面息，共軍正不斷增强張家口外圍兵力，對冀東戰事已近尾聲，且懷戒心，故連日在冀察邊境，增兵達八千，並破壞康莊岔道間橋樑公路，構築工事，並不時發生小接觸，極力爭取主動，自十三日起猛攻昌平，在鉅城五里地方激戰，昨午尙與守軍戰鬥中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕據悉大同之圍即可解除，城內守軍，正待命出攻，國軍克集寗後，已繼續沿鐵路綫南下，正會同東南兩路，向張家口急進中。又新華社綏東前綫十四日電，承認國軍於十四日攻入集甯。</p>

<p>〔聯合社南京十五日電〕國軍正向延安張家口間作楔形進攻，期收分別擎破之效。軍事觀察家注意胡宗南部自西安向太原北進，將深入延安張家口間，隔斷赤都東北兩路之交通。據最後消息：國軍有力部隊，已抵延安東面十臨汾。政府軍進攻張家口，將使察哈爾與東九省共軍之交通綫，岌岌可慮。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕　甯小組政府代表尹漢初，美方代表竇奎斯，共方代表張寒石等一行，昨晚乘軍調部專機返平，美方組員柯拉克中尉右脚骨，曾爲砲彈碎片擦傷，現已痊愈。據政府代表稱：收復集寗之國軍，正向豐鎭攻進，凉城方面國軍，無新進展，集寗攻防戰不太激烈，城內破壞不重，惟共軍退走時，將城內壯丁捕走甚多。另據此間關係方面稱，共軍可將以晋北綏東之主力，死守　鎭，以防國軍東進。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕今日冀東軍事，無何變化，河北民政廳長孫振邦，正在唐山指揮，冀東復員組訓民衆，武力修復道路等工作。皆在積極推進中。冀東共軍主力，現集結遵化西薊縣北平豐東之盤山中，該山廟宇羅列，山洞亦多至二千餘，皆可屯兵，頗不易進攻，至長城綫上大部爲國軍收復，僅冷口界嶺口尙爲共軍所據，長城以北興雍一帶，亦尙爲熱省共軍主力所在，中共熱省偽主席及若干工廠，俱在該地。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十五日電〕平古綫（現僅通至密雲）前因順義一帶路軌遭破壞，經路局飭工搶修，月內可全綫通車。</p>
<h3>共軍的訓令　暴露了貪污劣行</h3>
<p>〔中央社濟南十五日電〕據軍方獲得之共軍「渤海軍區訓令」一件觀之，足證共軍貪汚腐敗，魚肉人民之劣行，在其內部亦已有無法掩飾之感覺。該「訓令」初則稱，「査大進軍以來，部隊機動性大工作，失掉常軌。」（括弧內係引用原句，下仿此。）繼即列舉事實謂：「各部隊到處亂借亂吃，繳獲的東西亂存亂放，亂打游擊，形成極度紊亂。」「部隊生產，曾一度交代政府，各個生產人員，也趁此機會混水摸魚，貪汚腐化，亂搞一套，致使公家財政浪費，嚴重受到莫大損失。」最近幾月來，個別的機關部隊，仍有自已顧自己，不顧整體，自取自用，不尊重政府法令，虛報多領，打埋伏（此句語意不明），以及生產上作空洞計劃，不解決實際問題，依靠上級，依靠政府等現象」云云。</p>
<h3>延安徵募民團</h3>
<p>〔路透社天津十五日電〕此間軍界人士透露：延安之中共聯防總部，開始大規模徴募民團，延安以北各城每城均規定徴募人數，如綏德一千八百名，米脂一千五百名，嘉縣二千名，淸澗一千五百名，即在就地訓練。晋北共軍復徴集馬·騾·牛·驢等，組織遝輸隊。</p>
<h3>共軍侵佔比教產　教士多由陜逃亡</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕據悉：比利時在陜西三邊等地之敎堂敎產，因共軍進佔該地，巳被沒收。而該地之比籍與華籍傳敎士，復因不堪共黨之勒索壓迫，多巳逃亡其他各地。計逃入陜西橫山者二人，逃至磴口三聖公者七人，現尙爲共軍所扣押者五人。我政府對此事件，至爲關切，除已由陜西省政府派員前往橫山營救該二人，對其他各地逃亡敎士亦正在派員偵査營救中，並撥款予以救濟。</p>
<h3>隴海路徐商段　開始售票通車</h3>

<h3>魯境國軍由兗州挺進　濟甯近郊有激戰　各難民還鄉團協同工作</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南十五日電〕魯省局勢，因國軍自衛力之增強及黨政軍民之密切配合，確保政府各據點無虞，進而積極開展工作，魯西南數縣之克復，更增强人心之安定。我某有力部隊爲恢復兗州。濟甯間交通及應援北進國軍規復魯西，協助難民還鄕，於十四日晚由兗州向濟寗挺進，並配合地方保安部隊，各縣難民還鄉團，協同工作，聞十五日早已抵濟寗近郊，正與共軍激戰中。山東共軍本有卅三萬五千餘人，除調往蘇北者外，現留魯境者約廿六萬七千人，在濟南附近者約五萬至六萬人，其餘分配於膠濟綫者較多，觀其行動，對於自膠東經過膠濟綫（坊子以東蔡家莊附近）以迄魯南臨沂之交通路綫，特別注意保持，蓋因該地爲共軍自遼東半島迄蘇北之走廊也。國軍在膠濟綫上之自衛力亦極堅强，衆信膠濟路全綫通車必可達到目的。淄博煤礦區爲濟南燃料生命錢，自國軍克復後，共軍迄在附近配置其錢鈞·廖容標兩師之主力，不時向礦區進襲，均未得逞。刻山東全境大體平靜，但共軍在各縣征兵組隊，顯係準備戰事，且共軍如在蘇北失利，勢必退入山東，故山東國軍之自衛工作，未來實甚艱巨，據悉，臨沂附近共軍現不渦萬人，新四軍一三一旅已開往韓莊東北四字坡附近，阻國軍北進。渤海軍區共軍近在魯北德縣·平原·禹城等縣待軍運大批小麥赴太行山一帶。</p>

<h3>青年團幹監離牯</h3>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺十五日電〕靑年團二全大會秘書處人員，由倪文亞率領，十五日離牯返京，第二屆中央幹監亦於同時下山。</p>
<h3>美報揭穿延安策略　要求停戰實際乃一種伎倆</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十五日電〕今日「紐約時報」社諭稱：「蔣主席領導之國　政府軍隊所獲之一連串軍事勝利，已使共產黨繼續內戰之胃大减，目下竟欲經由馬歇爾將軍獲致休戰矣。但馬氏猶憶其已往之失敗，以及共產黨在以前談判中之固執態度，似不願有所行動。蔣主席之勝利如能繼續進展，可能使共產黨參加國民大會，而恢復一種不安與暫時之休戰狀態。延安　從事政治戰爭，竭力宣傳並誇耀共產黨在東北方面重大而可疑之勝利，但最近延安巳表現願意談判之傾向。共產黨一如以往，似又準備停戰一時。從事談判，但在此稱談判中縱使獲得若千確定之結果，事實上仍極可能爲另一次戰術上之　却。根據已往經騐，此種退却或仍係共產黨之一種使倆，以謀獲得一喘息機會，並借此以更大規模發動另一次政治戰爭」</p>
<h3>陳誠自鄭抵平　視察北方軍事</h3>

<h3>平夏令營結業　陳氏懇切致訓</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕陳總長誠今日下午四時出席北平靑年團夏令營結業典禮訓話，論及時局稱：政府殷望作政治的和平解決，極力避免打仗，實在沒法，逼得打仗，那是下策。軍隊的縮編仍應照原案，即政府保持九十個師，中共十八個師。談到靑年的苦閣，陳氏憤慨的斥責貪汚行爲，但謂：政府的高級首長，如同五院院長，絕不致有貪汚情事，且部長中如王世杰，俞大維等，生活都很淸苦。陳誠並謂，假使我貪汚，你們應認我爲敵人。陳氏要求靑年團員積極擁護政府，把握革命精神。陳氏謂：靑年團的歸屬問題，將無變化，惟爲整理團務，將設立團務整理委員會，以決定今後的一切興革，北平的失學靑年團員，亦將仿照南京辦法，設立進修班，以事收容。</p>
<h3>曾琦在長春談　澄清時局要圖　制定憲法確立民主</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十五日電〕青年黨主席曾琦十四日晨談稱：今日最關緊要者，爲民主政治之實現，而民主政治取決多數，所有問題均可於國會或以國民總投票方式決定之，此實爲澄淸時局之要圖，故目前吾人當致力者，實爲憲法之制定，使民主政治得以確立·曾氏並表示，渠民十七·八，九年間·曾經常在瀋陽一帶居留，長春之行，尚屬首次。曾氏以吳秘書長鐵城　告記者稱：「不到東北不知中國之大，不到東北，不知中國之危」。</p>
<h3>九龍城內治權　港府之聲明不符規定</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港十四日電〕港政府發言人發表談話，否認九龍城內仍爲中國領土及中國目前在該處行使治權。據稱：一八九八年北京條約協議訂立九十九年期限新界租約，劃定英租借地以深　至馬汩灣邊境爲界，該租約未聲明九龍城不在內·該約曾規定當時駐九龍城內之中國官吏，在不妨礙英方軍事需要條件下，得以繼續行使浩權，但迄一八九九年年，中國官吏在九龍城內之治權已因與英方軍事需要有所抵觸，宜吿中止·五十年來英當局已在九龍城內行使治權，一如在九龍新界地區·按一八九八年中英展拓香港英新租界合同，載有現在九龍城內駐紮之中國官員·仍可在城內各司其事一語，港方此次片面聲明，顯與合同規定不符。</p>

<h3>王外長返抵首都　對和會表現謂尚可滿意　同盟國重視我抗戰功績</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕外長王世杰，十五日下午四時一刻由昆飛返京·王氏於八週前離華赴法，出席歐洲和會，因主席電召，提前返國。隨行人員爲外部秘書周書楷等，在機塲歡迎者除外次甘乃光曁各司長外，並有法大使梅理靄，澳公使高伯蘭，英大使館參事華麟哲，美大使館參事白華德（白係代表馬特使曁司徒大使者），中宣部副部長許孝炎，敎次杭立武·羅家倫等，其夫人亦往迎·王身着灰色西服，手持白色草帽，精神飽滿，下機時面現笑容，與迎候者一一握手。法大使梅理靄首先趨前間曰：「你在巴黎愉快嗎」？王答：「甚感愉快」。旋白華德即代表馬特使曁司徒大使向王氏致問候之意。王氏並於機塲答記者詢問數點如次；問，在巴黎時對法國印象如何？答，承法國當局股勤款待，非常感激。問，美·蘇關係撲朔迷離，王部長之觀感如何？答，余認爲美·蘇最後仍必合作。問，此次和會大槪情形如何？答，此次和約較上次和約公道，如英·美宣言不向戰敗國索賠款，即爲一例。旋王氏驅車返寓，略事休息後，即赴吳秘書長處暢叙，王旋於寓邸接見記者，據談對和會觀感稱：此次和會，我主張在原則上爲處理軍事問題較嚴格，處理政治及經濟問題較寬大，對殖民地問題則主張不應視爲任何戰勝國之戰利品，和會之表現與我國主張及理想無大出入，尙可令人滿意。至對此次和會經過，主稱：和會當可於一月後獲有結果，目前尙不能肯定其結果如何，五國和約雖有爭論，但決可簽字。和約中賠款一事，英·美已宣言放棄，我在和會上亦始終未提賠償問題，我國一九〇〇年拳亂後，義大利雖未蒙受損失，亦要求賠款，而此次戰爭中，我國留義華僑所受損害甚大，但不欲提出賠款，意在使義國之民主自由份子得以抬頭，不欲殘餘法西斯份子藉口於條件之苛刻，而死灰復燃也，以上均爲此次和約公道之例證。對於義大利問題王並稱：主要在於殖民地之處理，如利比亞能獲獨立，或於聯合國托治下一定期限內獨立，中國之建議得以實現，則此次和會當較上次爲成功。又訊：王部長日內將舉行記者招待會，報吿出席和會經過。</p>
<p>〔中央社昆明十四日電〕省府主席盧漢，十四晚八時設宴，爲王外長洗塵，席間王氏致詞稱：（一）巴黎和會一月後必有結果，國際局勢前途不似所傳之危險，惟各大國能否充分合作，須視對德問題能否覓得滿意解決。（二）同盟國對中國過去抗戰之功績與未來之發展，均極重視，吾人必須努力，覓得國內之統一與和平，我國復興工作，斷不容再行延誤。</p>

<p>〔中央社牯嶺十五日電〕馬特使十五日下午五時赴行轅謁主席，作八登牯嶺後　首次晤談，歷時甚久始出。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕十五日又逢星期例假，一切皆期待馬特使返京後可見分　。馬特使十六日是否返京，尙無確訊，十五日晨馬特使曾自牯來長途電話，致其參謀柯義上校，適柯義於九時往訪司徒大使，未能通話，柯義與司徒談一小時後辭出。十二時傳涇波訪周恩來未晤及，僅與王炳南談半小時許，據聞傅氏此行仍在勸說共黨參加非正式五人小組會議，期從政治問題着手。共黨方面稱：傅氏往訪係普通拜會，未及其他，因五人小組會共黨已緊決　絕也。下午，大使往敎堂作禮拜，餘無活動。</p>

<h3>美將調整遠東政策　謀防止共黨威脅之蔓延　杜魯門對蘇態度待澄清</h3>
<p>〔合衆社筆盛頓十四日電〕政府負責方面人士稱：美蘇關係之日趨緊張，或將促使美國重新調整其遠東政策，其最迅速之後果，將爲美國之以勢力及物資援助中國國民政府，以對付共黨威脅之蔓延於遠東。該方面强調稱：目前尙無何種決定，在杜魯門對蘇態度之矛盾尙朱澄淸以前，當然不致有何決定。最近美國在遠東方面之若干行動’若十觀察家之解釋，認爲係由美。蘇關係在其他區域日趨破裂所致。美國於統一朝鮮不能取得蘇聯合作時，決心逕自進行其發展朝鮮南部政治經濟之工作，以及美國與中國國民政府訂立八億元之剩餘物資交易，均係傾向於此方面之明證。但決定政策之政府官員聲明，此種論斷並不正確，彼等聲稱：美國在朝鮮之行動，正如在遠東其他各地之行動無異，其動機乃因此等行動爲解決常地問題最有效之辦法，彼等否認美國在朝鮮之政策有何變動。但無論如何，此間人士對於馬歇爾特使及司徒雷登大使調解中國內爭之成功希望，實際上已經放棄。一般意見，認爲中國內戰將持續若千時期，並感覺美國無論願與不願，將被迫以物資及諮詢支持蔣主席。負責方面指出：美國對於其他區域之政府，能不能適合理想標準，但如遇其對方爲共產然時，則對該政府必毅然支持之。倘美國決定重新調整對華政策時，其最先之結果，必立即撥借已經指定給與中國之進出口銀行五億元借款，因其他各國申請借款事，須在年底以前決定，故對於中國借款事必須有所決定，庶幾中國不能獲得時，可以分撥於其他各國。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十五日電〕眞理報本日社論，指責美軍駐華爲中國不幸之源泉。略謂：「此項軍隊之留駐，僅可促成中國人民之不幸，而美國對於中國政府軍之物資援助，乃爲美國干涉政策之又一例。此舉與外長會議所作之決議，完全背道而馳。」</p>
<h3>錢公來對記者談　東北之接收工作　物資與人心外更應接收眼淚</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十五日電〕東北區接收淸査團錢團長公來一行十人，於十四日下午一時乘車赴永吉視察，中央社記者隨行。錢團長行前曾單獨接見中央社記者，暢談東北接收工作情形，錢氏以極興奮之語句，吿記者稱：有人設接收不在物資，主在人心，實際物資與人心之外，吾人更應當接收眼淚。東北在敵壓僞迫下，十四年中，建設固多，而此許多建設，無不由我東北同胞之血汗技術以及眼淚促成之。今値光復，故政府應着重發揮我東北同胞以血淚換得之經騐與技術，凡以往工作於生產部門·技術部門各機構中之技術人才·如礦山·電氣化學·衛生·醫藥等等，均當善加利用，俾盡其才，而不能予以忽視，蓋復興工作實利賴之，目前政府猶未能公布。凡曾於僞滿時代任偽政府之官吏者，在何種情形下，絕不令其再服務於現有之機關中。錢氏對此認爲須有明確之規定，因近來密吿箱內，接有此類檢舉性質之信件數起，錢氏具體表示稱：凡在僞滿時代，充任徵發調査配給等直接親民工作而確有擾民，病民之嫌疑者，均應避免錄用，其有改過向善期圖自新者，亦不能出任主管，僅能予以較低職務，使其不能擅出主張，再禍人民；至以往擔任調査工作者，目前實不能使其仍舊擔任原來性質之工作，如此則不致傷老百姓之心。</p>

<h3>管理民用航空事業　當局已擬訂辦法　民航公司登記須合標準</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕關於民用航空事業之登記與管理，有關當局本年五月間即曾擬有辦法一項，現正送請政院核示中。根據草案，民用航空公司如欲獲准登記，須先在航空設備與人員方面具備必要之條件，其航錢與業務等，亦須合乎規定，不合標準者，自難獲准，今後民航公司之登記與管理，皆將以該辦法爲準繩。同時民航公司之成立，亦須在該法通過以後。外傳某某民航公司，因不能公開營業，致賠累甚鉅，據關係方而談，該公司彼吊銷執照，其情形並不似外傳之簡單，且不能因此而認政府無意扶値民營航空事業。至該公司因此而受之虧損，該公司本身應負其責，聞該公司機構極龐大，似有極盡舖張之嫌，而在設備等方面，咸不合水準，最多時僅有飛機五架，其後又轉讓於另一公司，該公司若「投奔」香港，政府則自將當作外國公司看待，惟中英航空協定，至今尙未着手草擬，該公司飛機欲在上海停留，短期內恐尙難辦到。</p>

<h3>南昌見聞</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　房滄浪</p>
<p>京滬漢駐牯記者南昌訪問團一行七人，到達南昌已五日，連日訪問省垣各機關，各法團，曾參加黨政軍及南昌同業四次公宴，明後兩日將縱續訪問中正大學曁市區各學校。</p>
<p>贛民翹盼　主席蒞止</p>
<p>省垣各界每日以電話向牯嶺叩訊主席行程者、日有數十起。</p>
<p>南昌現有人口二十萬，市民儉樸成風，飲食起居均符節的之要旨，入晚　步街頭，見五色繽紛，大書「歡迎元苜」之牌樓，電炬通明，耀人限目，街衢熙熙攘攘之市民，類多穿着布質之短衣，時裝之摩登女子大多爲外來者，婦女燙髮塗口紅者爲數甚鮮。</p>
<p>重建南昌　需費甚鉅</p>
<p>南昌市區以內馬路之修整工作已開始重修，下水道工程，因得救濟總署贛分署之協助，可望順利完成，此一工程需費一億六百餘萬元，完全由贛分署捐助，聞市區原有之下水道，乃爲長達七百五十公尺之臭陰溝，如以人指伸入此陰溝之穢水內，即將燜脫，此項工程萬成後，市區唯一風景區之東湖，因穢水不致洩入湖內，即不致經年發臭。</p>
<p>南昌房屋戰前共有四萬六千棟，現時調査祗剩一萬一千數百棟，據南昌市長唐新吿本報記者，自去年九月至今日，新建之房屋只有六百棟，預計修建全市房屋道路以復興南昌，需費四百六十億元。</p>
<p>南昌東湖風景區，如蔣公堤，靑雲譜，偉大建築之烈士墓，全省四通八達如蛛網之公路，均爲戰前主席在省主持戡亂軍事時偉大之建設，湖濱綠樹成蔭之介石公園，爲南昌市民永念主席在贛指揮勦匪，拯救贛民，豐功偉績之建設，該園現爲南昌唯一之淸凉勝地。</p>
<p>民性純樸　物價甚低</p>
<p>南昌位於贛江東岸，爲全省政治經濟之中心，但因市民生活儉樸，購買力較弱，以此投機家及囤積居奇者流，多不敢在此輕試其身手，遊資多流向滬漢，當地銀錢業及富有者放款之利息，戰後最高曾到達十五分，現時則盤旋於八分至八分五之間，南昌沒有高利貸，故物價較低於東南各省，從經濟角度，可以看到江西民族性樸質之美德，與夫江西商人穩重之作風。</p>
<p>根據南昌市府的統計，及記者調査所知，此次外匯調整後，南昌物價甚少波動，綜計八十九種物價稍見上升者，只有舶來品及國外香烟三十七種，但最高之漲風，亦未逾百分之三十，就中呢絨嗶嘰僅漲百分之三或四，可見投機家在南昌的確不多。</p>
<p>江西全省的物價，最高爲九江，其次爲萍鄕與贛州，最低爲贛東。南昌物價最平穩，上米每石現價三萬元，猪肉每斤一千二百元，茶油每斤七百元，猪油每斤一千三百元，最近一月久旱無雨，晚稻收成平均不及七成。</p>
<p>江西政治　很想前進</p>
<p>江西現任省府主席王陵基，到任尙未及半年，成績還待努力，有人說江西的政治，過去是靜的，現在很想向前動，王陵基主席的用人方法，另有一套，他生怕猾吏拆烟汚，詳壞了江西的基層政治，對於饒有縣長經騐的不敢輕於選用，現時正在試騐中。</p>
<p>江西全省八十三縣市，直接受到戰禍者有四分之三，僅寧都，瑞金等十餘縣幸免戰災，但今年雖吿豐收，農民仍苦不堪言，亟待賑濟的有一百三十萬災胞，盼望行總多予物資救濟，尤其是糧食和衣服，他們不需要牛乾·罐頭·高跟鞋四等麵。</p>
<p>江西目前最大的困難，是「復員難。」省府請求的復員費總數計達五百六十億，但是行政院祗給了六億，就山敎育復員費僅得了兩億元，這數目只够復員一個中學校，其他就可知。</p>
<p>李民廳長的新政風</p>
<p>新任江西民政廳長李中襄，對於革新江西縣行政，很具決心，最近擬出巡全省各縣。據語訪者云：幹政治的老法子，是「敷衍」，但是它已經過去，現在應該脚踏實地的去切實做，他很想在江西樹立一種「看到就做，想到就做」的新政風，絕不空談。</p>
<p>最令江西衛生行政當局頭痛的一種病，無過於鼠疫在閩贛邊境的光澤縣，鼠疫的歷史已逾三十年，抗戰期間，鼠疫竟由光澤，南城兩縣蔓延至五縣，雖經外籍鼠疫專家伯力士多方努力，還沒有肅淸。鼠疫的流行期是秋末與冬初，聽說贛東疫區，已經開始注射預防了。據一位有經騐的同業說，贛省鼠疫之不能根絕，經費短絀與縣行政工作者之不够努力，爲兩大主因。</p>
<p>江西邊遠縣份有械鬥之風，有時竟致打幾年，現在分宜縣鄉民，因爲併鄕與爭取物資，又在打出手，聽說已經死傷數百人，在人力不裕的江西，這件事也値得注意。</p>
<p>（十五日自南昌發）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國外交政策不變</h3>
<p>美國國務卿貝爾納斯在德國發表演說，重申對德政策之後，未及數日，商務部長華萊士忽又在紐約發表演說，力言美國外交政策有改絃易轍的必要。這兩種不同的論調，暴露了美國國內正在醞釀對於外交政策的歧見，全世界的人們，都在期待杜魯門總統的抉擇。尤其是英國，在這五天之內，聽了這兩種截然不同的主張，好患像了寒熱病，熱了一陣，又冷了一陣。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統的最後聲明，終於在前天（十四日）發表了。他說：「余之初衷，僅欲表明贊成華萊士部長此項演說之權利，但無意表示贊成將此項演說作爲我國外交政策之聲明」。他又說；「我國政府旣定外交政策，迄無變更；且外交政策，非經總統與國務卿、曁參衆兩院領袖討論，不能作任何重大變更」。美國外交界此次因華氏演說所引起的軒然大波，當可因此而復趨平靜，就是世界各國關切美國外交政策的，也可釋然於懷了。</p>
<p>本報昨日社論，對於葉氏的演說，曾指出其後果勢將引起美國外交界的分歧，甚至形成兩種路綫的鬥爭，惟有杜魯門總統作明朗的表示，始能將此後果消　於無形。此際我們聞悉杜魯門總統的聲明，已知美國外交政策並無變更，固爲我們意料所及，但美國究係民主國家，不論對內對外的政策或方針，悉視民意爲依歸，華氏爲故總統羅斯福時代碩果僅存的部長，發表此種親蘇論調，顯然將獲得一部份急進份子的贊成，所以美國內郃對於外交政策的見解，在某一時期內，仍將有分道揚鑣之虞。</p>
<p>惟在國際勢紛亂如麻的今日，締造世界和平工作，正覺得困難重重，而美國對於和平的締造，又負有重大責任，必須美國上下團結一致，共同支持美國的外交政策，方有裨益於世界和平。誠如美共和黨領袖范登堡所云：「美國外交政策，全賴國內團結作爲後盾，故共和與民主兩黨咸以團結一致之美國陣綫，面臨世界，此乃覓致和平唯一的途徑」，我們也知道美國民主黨與共和黨，對於外交政策年來大同小異，很少出入，今後如果發生分歧，則不特美國外交政策在國際上不易成功、且對於國際局勢，亦將引起嚴重反響，而結果則美國本身也終必受害。但願美國政策，經過這次軒然大波之後，即能復歸平息，依然堅定如恒，以其全力支持世界各民主國家之團結，增強聯合國機構之地位與權力，以保障人類應享之自由與和平。</p>
<p>清查工作的對象</p>
<p>上海市參議會前天通過決議，選派參議員五人參加蘇浙皖區接收工作淸査團，協助該團第一組加緊工作。這自然是表示全上海四百萬人民，都想對渦去一年來的接收工作，有一番澈底的淸査。但是，我們先得認淸楚要被淸査的對象。</p>
<p>淸査團的成立，係根據上次參政會的決議而產生，其所負的任務雖極重大，而淸査的時間爲期甚短。怎樣能在短短的五十天內完成如此重大的任務？這當然是一個嚴重的問題。不過平心而論，各地淸査團雖無輝煌的成績，但也不能不說已收到相當的功效。第一，件地淸査幽已發現了許多大案子，除了業經報紙揭載的以外，尙有許多關係重大的案子，聞將密呈蔣主席批閱，這是外界所不知道的。即以上海一隅而論，發現的案子，也不在少數。第二，淸査團所到之處，使一般發「接收財」的人們，不得不少其戒心，甚至有某接收大員，切齒痛恨吿密的人，竟稱他們爲「非父母所生」。淸査團能使宵小痛恨，未始不是近來的一件快事。</p>
<p>然而各地然政軍經濟接收機關，辦理了一年多的接收工作，其所接受的物資·工廠·房產·土地·車輛以及其他一切財物，爲數甚鉅，單以目錄一項而論，恐已需車載斗量，而淸査團人手有限，除了團長團員而外，僅有秘書幹事若干人，辦事親費又少得可憐，對於這些淸册，如何能一一加以淸査呢？所以在五十天內，僅能査淸了一部份，不得不旱請中央政府延長淸査時間，聞中央已准予延長到本月底爲止。但我們預計，再延長牛月，又何能有濟於事？上海市參議會接受淸査團的邀請，決定派員參加工作，同爲我們所樂聞，但祇去參加合唱一段「尾聲」，究會有什麽好調兒唱出來呢？我們倒又不禁爲五位參議員揑一把汗！</p>
<p>收復區的民衆，在日月重光的時候，對於中央政府原都熱烈歡迎，竭忱擁戴，但因爲代表政府到收復區的接收大員，只知接收物資及房屋，而對於收復區的民心，棄之不顧，重勞主席的撫慰，並派遣宣撫大員再去「接收人心」，可是政府的名譽與威望，已經被這些接收大員們蹧蹋得不堪言狀了。故我們以爲淸査團工作的對象，應該以接收機關和接收大員爲對象，淸査他們是否淸白，而不應再以收復地區的人民爲對象，再使此輩哀哀無告的人民重受一次威迫。縱使接收工作發現貪汚舞弊的時候，難免牽涉到人民，但要懲辦理應先徵辦接收舞弊的官員，而不可僅以困辱前已屢被詐欺的人民爲能事。淸查工作如果認錯了對象，那不是有助於「接收人心」，而反使收復區的人民更多一番惶惑與不安，這當非淸査團組織之本意吧？</p>
<p>失業問題的忠告</p>
<p>失業這個問題，在目前太嚴重了，市參議會的提案和質詢中，有好幾起，提到這個問題；而且有許多人督責政府，因何不早些設法解決。這話，當然是對的。但是政府本身，沒有這許多廣厦，渝二滬八這個原則，沒有中央的大力，又無法强制各工廠實行，所以辦法雖是很對，要單靠這個辦法來解決失業問題，還顯然見得不够。</p>
<p>有人提議舉辦合作工廠來容納這些工人；這話也是對的。問題是在工廠·原料·資金等等先決問題。縱使一一順利地解決了，這些失業工人，是否全部容納得下？其工作的技術，又是否能完全配合得上？他們更是否究全願意加入？這些，顯然還成問題。所以，辦法雖是對的，但要單靠這個辦法來解決失業問題，依舊還是不够。</p>
<p>有人主張舉辦大規模的公共工程來容納這些工人；這話也是對的。國內國外，有過不少的先例），中央有過明令，而且本市也辦過工賑，吸收過相當的失業工人，無奈失業的還是失業。可知辦法雖是對的，但要單靠這個辦法來解決失業問題，也還見得不够。</p>
<p>有人極力主張，應把接收的敵僞工廠全部復工；這話，當然更對了。但是已開工的，還迫得它們要停工（最近聞紡建就有兩廠停工），未開工的，究竟怎樣才能使他復工？最近各地標賣工廠，甚至並無受主，何等可慘！可知辦法未嘗不對，但要單靠這個辦法來解決失業問題，顯然還是不够。</p>
<p>有人以爲，安插旣然不易，何妨舉辦小本貸款來暫維他們的生活？這話，也是對的。我們從少佔計，假定目前滬市的失業工人爲五萬人，每人貸給國幣十萬元，那末，總數就要五十萬萬元。這筆鉅款，如何籌措，姑且不問；但是市上平添這許多小販，試問有沒有這許多生意讓他們來做？現在當局不是狠嚴厲地在取締攤販嗎？舊攤販尙在取締，難這可以容許新攤販嗎？可知小本借貸的辦法也是對的，但要單靠這個辦法來解決失業問題，仍然終覺不够。</p>
<p>有人以爲這些工人，大多數並非本地人，尤其是來自後方的，並非是本地工人。本市旣沒有安插之處，不妨籌一筆經費來遣送他們還鄕。這話，也未嘗不對，可是近乎以鄰爲　，根本上欠澈底。而且有許多遭了兵災，已是無家可歸。在蘇北等共黨騷擾之區，我們安撫勞徠，還來不及，更何忍硬遺他們　去？可知辦法固是辦法，但要靠這個辦法來解決失業問題，也欠切實，欠澈底。</p>
<p>失業是社會的病態，尤其是此時中國的社會病態，其病根不止一處二處，有許多固受戰事的影響，而有許多還是戰後「人造的」失業。我們相信：此時並沒有眞的萬應靈膏丹可以拿來藥到病除，把失業病連根拔去的。消極的救濟，應常從多方面着手，並要倚仗多數人的努力，殊途同歸，分頭並進，或可以轉重爲輕，化險爲夾。尤其是我們所認爲最重要的，仍在乎政府與民休息，讓老百姓悉心將養，恢復元氣，工廠可以開起來，生意可以「活得落」多多開放他們謀生的活路，减少硬幹一些奪去他們飯碗的勾當，使已失業的漸漸地就業，在業的千萬不要再使他　爲失業，我們覺得，現在政府演許多辦法。有意地或無意地在製造失業，促進失業，增加失業，這正是大可寒心的一件事！</p>

<h3>暢論特里埃斯特問題　莫洛托夫借題發揮　透露蘇外交政策真面目　諷示英政制已不合潮流</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十五日電〕美商務部長華萊土日前在紐約發表之驚人演說，引起國際問重大波瀾，其最後反響正在消沉之際，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫本日又在和會對義政治及領土委會席上，發表刺激演說，此乃莫氏自莫斯科返巴黎以來第一次發言，已引起政治世界之新震動，正所謂一波未平而一彼又起矣。莫洛托夫在演說巾，並乘機發揮其對其他更重要問題之意見，多少透露蘇聯外交政策之眞相，面爲一般人所急欲知悉者也。莫氏以英蘇問之民主慨念相對照，認爲英國之民主觀念爲十九世紀之遺物，此種觀念較諸常時之專制政治果勝一籌，或有其存在之價値，但此際已臨二十世紀，亟宣採取一種澈底現代化之民主政治，加蘇聯所締造者是也。蘇聯之政制不但適用於蘇聯本國，且可施行於其他國家，保加利亞即其一例。莫氏指責英國之政治制度，涉及其殖民地統治方式，謂英國對於特港未來地位之提議，與其施行於各殖民地者，並無不同云云。要之，華萊士之演說也，莫洛托夫之演說也。其牽涉範圍均極廣大，使關係各國不能不寄以密切之注意也。</p>
<p>特港應由四強共管　設立民主自治政府</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十四日電〕和會對義政治及領士委員會，本日午後開會，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，即席發表演說，暢論特里埃斯特區問題，歷時達一小時之久。其吾略謂，外長會議並未能爲特港問題，覓致解決辦法，致使對義政治及領土委會迄今仍面臨四項不同之建議，而束手無策。以言蘇聯所提之計劃，因主張以民主地位畀予特港，使特港之利益有所保障，故較其他任何計劃，更能表達業經四強同意之基本原則。所謂基本原則，可分爲二點：即（一）山聯合國安全理事會任命一行政長官，（二）依照民主原則行使立法權及行政權。本人認爲英美法三國所提之三種建議，均以特港，人民尙無行使其本身主權之能力爲藉口。而將全權委諸行政長官，殊難令人滿意。根據此種理由，英國計劃將全經委諸行政長官，與其在印度及西非所爲初無二致。但我人應明暸，適宜於印度與西非者，並不適用於特港，反之，蘇聯之民主制度則不論施諸何處。俱能證明其爲有效，若保加利亞即其一例。</p>
<p>和約生效三十天內　外國駐軍全部撤退</p>
<p>民治民享之政府，殆爲蘇聯計劃之　點，即將立法權與行政權畀予由普選產生之人民會議，而美英法蘇四國代表所組成之明國委員會，其任務一如臨時政肘，準備在三個月以內舉行選舉，將義大利法西斯餘孽根本消減，所有外國軍隊應於對義和約簽訂後三十日內，自特港撤退，即聯合國安理會亦不得在該處駐軍，良以駐軍足傳特港成爲軍事基地故也。至於澳洲代表所提建議，主張設立一特殊理事會代替安理事會，處理特港一切事務，此項建議殊屬不當，究其眞正目的，乃在反對四强行使否決權。國際組織擬締造世界和平與安全，而創立此項否決權，在歷史上尙屬第一次，但澳洲代表迷惑過去，而欲時光倒流，得以重度尙無否決權之時代也。舊國聯在實際上究係何物，乃英法兩國集團統治歐洲之工具耳，其結果如何，慕尼黑會議與戰爭耳。面慕尼黑曾議者，係英法兩國集團不惜犧牲民主國家，而與侵略者妥協。目下如無否決權制度，吾人勢將促成世界分裂爲兩種勢力範圍，而結果所屆，將再引起戰爭與人類浩刧。吾人摒棄五強或摒　蘇聯而欲締造世界和平，則此項企圖必歸於失敗，吾人觀點有時不免紛歧，但亦應不惜任何代價覓致協議云。</p>
<h3>和會爭執何時休　希保疆界問題困難漸增多　有急起址追特港問題之多</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十四日電〕巴黎和會雖已規定結束期限，然仍綱續感受外界事件之影響。最近之事件如美國商務郃長華萊士之演說，華氏主張以較和平之方式，處置美蘇關係，是與和會中貝爾納斯所率領美國代表團之對蘇強硬政策，適屬相反，結果不免使和會局勢益趨複雜。一般以爲華氏演說荀無社魯門總統之批准，當不致被人重視，然在和會內部今亦尙未有改變美國政策之表示。再就和會內部之事件言，保加利亞政治及領土委員會所討論希保國界問題，困難漸增，有急起直追特港問題之勢，以言後者除民族意識外，尙具有東歐集團之出海口問題。</p>
<p>義奧糾紛　會外談判</p>
<p>蘇代表本週在委員會中已有坦白之承認，此等强權政治之重大問題不獲解決，則其他方面即有進展亦屬徒然。由於會內談判之易受牽制，因此會外談判之方式亦隨之而興，義奧關於南蒂羅爾之協定乃其一例。</p>
<p>義賠償問　題審查中</p>
<p>義經濟委會之賠償批號組會，已開始對十三國之要求賠償加以審査，義大利表示至多祇能負擔五千萬至七千五百萬鎊之賠償額，其中且有二千五百萬已同意付給蘇聯，故小組會當於各國些求額與義所能負擔額間，覓取平衡決定。又悉，多明尼哥共知國今日亦被列人向義要求賠償國名單內。</p>

<h3>美外交政策仍無變更　杜魯門發表聲明　僅批准華萊士發言權　共和黨乘機抨擊政府</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕杜魯門總統今日招待記者，宣佈渠已撤回對商長華來士演說之批准，總統表示渠所批准者，乃華氏之　言權。杜總統前此批准華氏之　演說時曾謂，渠認貝爾納斯之政策與華萊士之政策並無不同，然今日杜總統稱，渠之批准該一演說，並非表示欲使該演說作爲我國外交政策之聲明。本人於星期四在記者招待會中之答覆，業已引起外界之誤解，余之答覆係常塲提出，該答覆並未能表達余之原意，余之原意乃批准商長華萊士有發一表演說之權，並不欲批准其演說作爲我國外交政策之聲明也。我國已定外交政策仍　變更，在總統國務卿及議會人士未有討論前，外交政策不致有重大轉變云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十四日電〕今日此間獲悉，美國務卿貝爾納斯與其兩參院顧問已迫使杜魯門總統否認其以前會核准商務部長華萊士之演說係美國外交政策之　明。自華氏之演說在國際間引起軒然大波後，貝爾納斯與總統並未通長途電話，惟悉參議員康納利與范登堡曾與杜魯門通話，所述甚多。范登堡警吿杜魯門稱，總統在此種情形下。其外交政策欲得兩黨之繼續支持，殊不可靠，並吿總統渠應在華萊士與貝爾納斯兩人之間，選擇一人，作爲外交政策之發言人。康納利籲請國內一致擁護貝爾納斯，間接指責華萊士具有政治野心。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕代理國務卿克萊頓今日在華府與杜魯門總統討論美國之外交政策及開係。克萊報吿記者讀，並未直接討論華萊士之演說，僅談及和平之題目而已。克萊頓此次謁總統，事先並朱宣布，克氏事後表示以後有關此事之聲明，當由社魯門總統發表。克氏並謂，自華萊士發表演說後，渠並未與貝爾納斯接談。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社美國傑弗遜城十四日電〕共和黨全國委會主席李斯，本日在此間發表演說，抨擊杜魯門政府，據稱，民主黨現正在少數領袖控制下，指揮一黨之政策，此輩一味關切外國之觀念，對於保持本國政府形式，反不甚關心云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十四日電〕共和黨競選委員會主席勃朗，本日發表談話，要求商務部長華萊士辭職。其言曰：「杜魯門內閣之兩閣員，對於如此重大之問題，發表矛盾之言論，實令人不快。此種情形旣爲國家之恥辱，復爲國家之危機」云。</p>
<h3>華萊士政見　獲勞工支持　不安全探照燈　審查美外交政策</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕此間觀察家相信，若美國勞工起而支持商務部長華萊士於星期四發表之演說，則華氏地位必可大爲增强。民主黨領袖對該一演說，至今尙守械默，惟共和黨全國委員會宣傳委員勃朗則謂，値茲美國政府力圖拉攏急進份子之際，華氏突發表此一演說，顯然具有供政府採納之意。其他若干人士則謂，華氏此一演說，在準備競選一九四八年副總統，意欲在今秋國會選舉前，促成左翼份子之團結。亦有謂華萊士在工業組織大會之支持下，擬再步羅斯福之後塵，與蘇成立諒解。此間皆認華氏之言，爲一篇經過愼重考慮之演說，杜魯門總統之予批准，意在於國會選舉前，保持貝爾納斯與華萊士兩派對立意見之平衡云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社弗洛列達州米亞米十四日電〕參院外委會民主黨議員貝柏今日宣稱，商務部長羣萊土在紐約發表現　，無異以安全之操照燈，審査美國外交政策，對於和平貢獻甚大。華氏主張甚接近美國人民之公意。由余視之，國務院所行政策，並不足以代表民意。對蘇怨毒，百分之九十五係反動份子及帝國主義者之「　空宣傳」。</p>

<h3>新發現的舊史實　一：德蘇義西四國聯盟　二：納粹發動細菌戰爭</h3>
<p>— ——合衆社蘭德著——</p>
<p>美國務院最近發表　獲的德國秘密文件一種、是德國外長李賓特洛甫各義首相墨索里尼，一義外相齊亞諾會談的紀錄，據其透露，墨索里尼曾於一九四一年建議，由希特勒糾織以德。義。西班牙及蘇聯爲主幹的「歐洲聯合陣綫，」以打倒英國。軸心國兩領袖一致認爲軸心國應多方設法勸誘法國一致對英宣戰。李氏在佔量爭取戰爭勝利的希望時向墨索里尼保證美國的所謂重整軍備實在是「歷史上大的誇張」。</p>
<p>該文件指明此次會議主要目的在討論軸心國與當時法國總理兼外長達朗的關係，赫斯事件，和希墨兩巨頭下次會議的準備情形。此事發生於希特勒決定放棄對英全面進攻而改向蘇聯進攻以前，僅僅幾個月的時間。</p>
<p>據該文件載稱：李賓特洛甫吿訴墨索里尼說：「元首認爲無論如何必須爭取最後勝利，爲了達此目的起見，願意對法國作最大議步。」李氏繼稱：「法國問題正是根據這條原則處理的，達朗究竟願意合作到若何程度，此刻便可知道的。但是對法讓步應以法國帮助對英作戰爲交換條件。」</p>
<p>墨索里尼的回答是「法國對於軸心國可以貢獻許多小而極重要的帮助」。他强調說：「當軸心國勝利時，法國往往愈加接近軸心國。但是在情形不佳時，她又轉向英美做眉眼。」</p>
<p>該文件續稱：一德國外長表示同意說：如果能把法國拉攏於軸心國組織，一定會使美國到得深刻的印象。墨索里尼援引希特勒聯合全歐對付英國的策略，對於德外長的意見表示同意。只是蘇聯和西班牙還沒有加人此聯合陣綫。常時的西班牙外長蘇納固曾聲明西班牙將於本年收穫期以後實行參戰。但此點在他有來是極端可疑的。德國外長說。不幸在本年（一九四一年）初法郞哥離東了軸心國。要是法國在那時加入了軸心國，直布羅陀海峽此時早已從英國人手裏奪得了，同時西班牙人可以得到更多的食糧，不像現在向英美乞求布施而一無所得。此時墨索里尼重新提到歐洲聯合陣綫對抗英國和尙未加入該陣綫的西蘇兩國，他一再聲明和蘇聯合作的政策果能如願以償，在他看來是一件有利於軸心國的。」</p>
<p>後來三人的話題轉到了美國方面。李賓特洛甫識刺美國重整軍備計劃爲「歷史上最大的誇張」。墨索里尼對於「美國內部已經發生裂痕」的提示似乎表示同意，並且援引美前總統胡佛和林白上校的演詞，作爲反對已故羅斯福總統的反軸心政策的代表論調。</p>
<p>紐侖堡審訊德罪犯的工作，即將結束，木月底可宣佈各被吿的罪名。</p>
<p>關於希特勒黨對人類所犯的股大罪行，似乎已盡其詳，但是除了活活把人燒死等暴行外，眞理報記者最近又報吿了納粹匪徒最新的罪行，這篇文章題爲「法西斯主義最後的秘密」，是最新發現的希特勒黨徒的罪行。我們現在讓事實證明一切，讓我們聽聽德軍高級指揮部醫藥主任和細菌專家雪里白的供狀。</p>
<p>據這位雪里白稱：「德軍在史大林格勒吃了敗仗之後，柏林會舉行秘密會議，在這會議中德參謀總部的代表宣佈了希特勒準備從事細菌戰的命令</p>
<p>雪里白，以專家資格參加會議，並且要提出結論。同時並由戈林負責成立細菌戰爭委員會，這事情的發生，是在一九四三年七月。</p>
<p>這種準備，在瘋在的速度下進行，由巴爾米敎授成立特種學院，從德國移到波蘭的波士南去進行；在那裏，納粹殺人犯培植細菌，並且以人類做試騐。</p>
<p>一切把這狠毒的利器進攻人類的惟備都己完成，但是納粹這一只最後王牌，又給紅軍所擊破。蘇軍用閃電式的進攻，佔領了波士南，因此，這細菌製造大本營也就落於紅軍之手。希特勒匪徒，雖然企圖把它炸毀滅跡，但是己來不及了</p>
<p>可是，德一力指揮部並不因此死心，他們又把細菌戰製造所移到沙遜堡，以便完成這種危害整個人類的工作。但是因爲紅軍前進的迅速，納粹這一次的計劃再度失敗。</p>
<p>紅軍開始進攻柏林，法西斯老鼠從將沉下去的希特勒船逃出。企圖保全他們的皮毛；德國的行政，乃陷於停頓，細菌戰也因此未實現。英勇的紅軍擊破了希特勒最惡毒的最後一只棋子，納粹這種計劃，威脅了整個人類，細菌戰爭，提起了就令人不寒而慄。</p>
<p>紅軍發現了納粹最後的秘密，挽救了臚個人類。</p>

<h3>參議會昨開全體審會　縝密檢計市府預算　市長解釋節流已至最高限度人民負担輕於戰前</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕參議會對於市府下半年度預算之審核，爲求愼重週密起見，特於昨日上午召開全體審查大會，作原則上之檢討。</p>
<p>大會於九時二十分開始，先由市長報吿預算編製經過，繼由第九審査小組召集人徐永昨及李文杰兩會計師先後報吿兩次小組會議經過及個人對於審査預算之意見。十一時休息十分鐘後，各議員紛紛發表見解情緒熱烈，發言踴躍。中間財政局長谷春帆對於向中央請求補助及加徵房捐等項略加補充解釋。大會延長至十二時三十分猶未能完畢，議長宣稱因時間關係先行散會，參議員未及發言者可於下午第九審查小組第三次會議中繼續發表。上午各種意見由議長歸納結果，所得原則爲：先行審查各種建設事業是否均屬必需以及行政管理費用是否可再减省而求節流，如確不敷再行硏討增加枕收之方法。</p>
<p>下午三時，第九審查小組第三次會議在市商會舉行。由工務，地政財政三局報吿預算用途，財政局長谷春帆特提出民國二十五年度市府及租界行政費所佔之百分率遠高於今日，而建設性之費用今日所佔之百分率則高出當時一倍有餘。謂此足可表示市府注重建設之一斑云。</p>
<p>市長報吿預算編製經過，首稱此次由於時間惚促及接任未幾，對於本市情形尙未熟悉，故預算之編製確尙未盡滿意。繼就預算格式及編製方針分別加以說明稱：（一）預算格式，參議員認爲太簡單，有似空中樓閣，惟事實上有困難之處，蓋政府機關與商業機關不同，行政費與本業費不易劃分，且中央通例亦無劃分之規定。至於編製預算所根據之工作計劃，預算中雖可約略看出，確亦不够詳細。茲爲補救起見，特將市府現有編制人員數額及本年度工作計劃另行油印分發，以供參考。（二）編製方針：一、節流方面，個人認爲已實行至最高限度。戰前市政府工部局法公董局三機構，共有員工人數達五千餘人，錢市長任內亦有三千五百餘人，現巳裁减至二千九百餘人，故就管理費而言，僅及戰前一半有餘。如一定再要减縮，請顧及實際困難，予以「軟性」規定。二、此次編製預算，旣非量入爲出，亦談不上量出爲入，蓋如量出爲入，僅如防汎工程一項，即需一百億元以上，再如修築道路橋樑，亦須一百億至二百億元，事實上決無可能。故現有預算之編造，係就目前社會經濟狀况下，一方面求緊縮，一方面求建設，計算最低之維持費及最低之事業費。戰前三行政機構全年總支出五千餘萬元，以幣値五千倍計算，合現値二千七百餘億，半年爲一千三百餘億，較之現在半年預算八百餘億爲多。再就人民負擔言，戰前每人每年約十五元至十六元，現在以四百萬人口照半年計算，每人約爲二萬元，全年爲四萬元，以五千倍計，僅合戰前八元而已。</p>
<p>市長復着重指出參議會係市政之最高決策機構，可通過預算決算把握財權，市政之好壞大部份賣任在於決策機構，故對於此次預算應求合理之審核，不能完全以减輕人民負擔爲前提。「否則」，市長最後以徵笑之語氣結束其報吿稱：「任何事都不必辦矣」。</p>
<h3>房捐與市政捐　似有重複之嫌　第九組召集人徐永祚報告意見</h3>
<p>第九組審查委員會召集人之一徐永祚會計師報吿該組及第三小組兩次會議情形後發表其個人之意見稱：（一）就數字分析半年總預算八四七億，以四百萬人口計，平均每人半年負祖二萬一千元。較之本年國家總預算二五二四九億，以半年計約合百分之六·七。（二）關於與戰前三行政機構費用比較一節。二十五年三行政機構總支出爲四千七百餘萬，以五千倍計，其半年支出數合現在一千一百餘億，似較現在預算八四七億爲多。但詳細分析之下，現在預算中百分之五十二以上係工作人員之薪工及生活補助費，按中央規定數計算僅合戰前一千五百倍，故如以百分之五十二按一千五百倍折合，戰前三行政機構之半年費用約合現値七百七十億元，且其中一部份係債務支出須除外計算，再則戰前外籍職員之薪津特大，不能與現在公務員此較，故確實算來，戰前三行政機構之半年支出數僅合現値七百二十億而巳。（三）預算中支出最大部份係　津及生活補助費，計佔百分之五十二以上，最好應分析何者屬於行政經費，何者屬於事業經費。就市府現編印之分類表視之，若十單位人數似屬太多。（四）財政收入目前尙在不合理狀態，若十稅收應儘速舉辦，如已登記之地價稅及南市閘北越界區域之房捐，此外可注意公用事業受益費及私人牌照捐等。在眼前民生凋弊之時，要大規模舉辦市政，恐不能全求之於捐稅，個人意見認爲可用舉債等方式籌募。（五）市府交議之五項彌補收支不敷辦法，其中房捐與市政捐有重複之嫌，再則房捐增加過大，超過房租，顯與中央法令有所抵觸。</p>
<h3>參議員發表意見　計劃中建設工作是否都是必要　行政經費是不是可以再行節省</h3>
<p>參議員發表對於市府預算的意見，第一個走上麥克風前的是路式導，他說「審査預算先要考慮幾個大前提：（一）市政府不是營利機關，不給錢就不能做事。（二）如果給，給多少？（三）給的錢從何而來？（四）給了以後的結果怎樣，市民有沒有力量負担？我認爲現在的市政府朝氣勃勃，如果我們不通過預算，它就無法做事。我們代表民衆，祗問事情對不對，不管人家駡不駡。所以我主張幾個原則：（一）把市政府所要舉辦的建設事業分別淸楚，那幾件事不要做，那幾件事要做。要做的事市政府要多少錢，我們就給多少錢。（二）錢的來源，市民頭上多少總要加一點，但不應多立名目，可以着重在一二種有負担能力捐稅上。（三）市政府應少管閒事，要以消極性的管制費移作積極性的建設費」。</p>
<p>傅汝霖因事先行離席，他預先寫好了幾點意見請路式導代爲發表：（一）他認爲預算八百四十七億應全部通過。（二）事業費與行政費的分配中央有明文規定。（三）應辦的工程可以分期來辦。（四）不足的經費可以請求中央補助。</p>
<p>詹文　接着說：一參議會　顧到本身立塲，我們通過的法規以不抵觸中央法令爲原則。現在市府交議的五種增加稅收辦法，其中市政捐淸潔捐及公用事業附加費均於法無據，房捐一項如超過房租，亦與中央法令抵觸，且使房東增加房租有所藉口。至於開放跑馬廳問題，市長說跑馬的收入兩年內可將跑馬廳收回，但是試以每月收入四億元計，兩年才九十六億，而跑馬廳單就地價一項就値三千餘億，試問如何收得回來？至於外人要在跑馬廳建築房屋，公用局有權阻止，不足爲開放馬賽的理由。所以我主張所缺的二百億元建設費可以在房捐項下另行附加徵收」。</p>
<h3>中央拿許多錢去　應該還一些出來</h3>
<p>陶百川補充傳汝霖所提向中央請求補助的意見，他說：「中央從上海拿了許多錢去，應該還些出來，市長不必客氣」！</p>
<p>季　認爲市府人員還可减少，尤其秘書處和地政局，非但職員太多，公役也太多。至於市長交議的五種加稅辦法都是巧立名自，四川人所謂「要不得」！但是他對於賽馬倒認爲可以視作運動，不過應該到郊外去。</p>
<p>副試長徐寄廎也發表意見了，他說：「我們不要看見「億」字就怕，巧媳婦難爲無米之炊，我們要協助市政府」。</p>
<p>谷局長對於向中央請求補助及房狷等項加以補充解釋後，童行白繼起發表意見說：「收入方面應從地價稅上求根本解決，實行三民主義的土地政策，支出方面事業費與行政費必須有一定比例，行政效率不在乎人多」。</p>
<p>汪竹一的意見比較最合乎「原則」的檢討，他認爲審核預算第一應放寬尺度，第二要考核工作，第三參議員要負起責任來，不怕外界攻擊。他說「又要馬兒好，又要馬兒不吃草」是不可能的，此外他也主張向中央要求補助。</p>
<h3>建設目的在利民　增加負担是病民</h3>
<p>費樹聲則大聲疾呼的主張核减到六百億元以下，他說建設目的在利民，現在先要增加負担，反是病民了。而且預算一增就是四倍，其他物價勢必要受影響而增加，循環下去，如何得了？所以他主張不需要做的不做，要做的盡量節省。</p>
<p>時間已經延長到十二點三十分了，主席台上還有許多要求發言的條子。議長站起來說：所有的意見歸納起來得到兩個原則：第一，應該先審査計劃中的建設工作是否都是必需，第二·行政管理方面的費用是不是可以再行節省。如果還是不够那末再研究開原的方法。來不及發表的參議員，可以在下午第九審查小組會議中，發表他們的意見」。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕記者昨與王維　參議員談及市長交議案件中房捐及市政捐之比較，據談兩者利弊互見，惟房捐利點較多，且新辦法房主負担捐額僅限實租百分之二十，如提高租價則負担捐額亦比例增大，故可與房租收調節之效。再則徵收資料均屬現成，僅須決定標準，比較單純易行。而每年收入則較市政捐可多出六十億元云。</p>
<h3>市商會函參議會　請轉呈八項建議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市商會，昨函市參議會，請向市府建議，將挽救工商危機請願八事項，轉呈中央，迅予實現。並由該會發言人發表談話，聲述四聯總處上海分處停止貸款之經過情形</p>
<h3>第九組第三次審查會　聽取工務政財三局解釋預算</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕負責審査市府預算之第九小組，昨日下午三時假市商會開第三次審査會，聆取工務·地政·財政三局對預算之解釋，由徐永祚任主席，到列席議員十數人，曁趙祖康·祝平·谷春帆三局長及各局會計主任。潘議長徐副議長亦先後到會。先由處舜參議員發言，對敎育·文化·建設·衛生四項預算分爲必要，次要，再次要評定緩急核减，以不牴觸中央法令爲原則，並建議單獨徵收市政建設捐，專用作市政建設，又盼市府多營生產事業，以補助市政經費，同時主張請求中央補助。</p>
<p>繼由朱文德參議員提請各局供給更多審查資料，以供審查時之參考。對稅收方面，朱議員之意見：（一）反對房捐累進制，南市閘北二區房捐應即恢復開徵，（二）地價稅增加，能刺激房租。（三）本市田畝種植棉花爲主，故田賦以穀價折合，實欠公允。本市財政困難請求中央補助，朱參議員認爲最恰當。李參議員文杰，特別提出，市府公地之處置辦法，對以前敵偽時期之土地承購人增收地値，將其所得，移作整理地權經費。並表示對各局預計，參議會並非一味减少，如確宣必需亦可以增加。其後，主席即請工務局趙局長先解釋，趙局長稱：本局預算大體分（一）經常行政費—包括路工工資。（二）經常事業費——包括道路·橋樑·溝渠·房屋等八大要務。（三）臨時事業費——較有伸縮性。本局用人方面有三原則；內少外多，事少技多，職少工多。即外勤多於內務，技術人員多於事務人員，工人多於職員。編制方面注重包工與購材時發生流弊，採取牽制平衡制·購料·配料·用料三權分立。至下半年度一百二十一億之臨時預算，較上半年度七十七億，雖表面數字上增加，然物價工資下半年度遠高於上半年度，故實際上並未增加，建築工程材料，平均較戰前漲一萬倍，趙局長特別提出興築西藏路宋公園路製造局路貫通南北之大道，使本市今後之發展平均。繼爲地政局祝平局長解釋，土地未整理完竣前三十億地價稅之徵收殊無把握，並說明三十一億預計之支配。</p>
<h3>谷春帆解釋困難　房捐係中央規定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政局谷局長春帆，昨日上午在全體審查預算會席間，對於若干議員提出調整稅收意見，特解釋其困難稱：個人關切預算及財政實較各位更重，要求中央撥給目前頗不易達到，因去年及上半年度均由中央撥補一部份，但自七月中央召開財政收支系統會議後，巳將應撥與地方者明確規定。同時地方市政及事業建設均一日不可間斷，如果每次都要向中央要，實不可能，即使中央允撥，其請撥期間，工作勢將停頓。</p>
<p>此外有人提議征收汽油稅，但汽油稅屬貨物稅，而貨物稅應歸中央，不屬地方。碼頭捐曾於上半年呈請中央撥給，但未獲允准，現已再度呈請中。對提高汽車牌照稅之建議，確可採納，但一時尙無把握。至地價稅則早已列入預算中。房捐一項係中央規定，必須征收。市政捐則係地方之一種特別捐，由地方自定。房捐增高後，並不一定影響房租。房租是否須改動，尙待參議會之決定。征收房捐一概按照實收房租取百分之二十云。</p>
<p>卅五年下半年度各機關員工長警　俸給及生活補助費明細表</p>
<h3>市府預算與戰前比較　建設費用有顯著增加　谷春帆出席審查會報告</h3>
<p>最後財政局谷春帆報吿各項稅收預算稱：對田賦每畝徵穀九斗二升，合米四斗六升，若照目前米價折算，高達三萬四千餘元，而戰前僅一元，故財局認爲過高，已向糧部請求核减，以不超過物價倍數爲原則，徵收方式亦試辦革新，不利用地保舊法，對房捐原預算二十七億，其等級標準，徵收辦法，俟大會決定。至財局支出八億九千萬元中，票照印制費。四億五千萬，佔全數之半。谷局長又發表目前市府各項預算與民國二十五年，兩租界與一市府各項支出總和之百分比增减情形稱：（一）警察公安費以前佔百分之三十，現减至百分二十七。（二）行政費由百分之十六點八七减至百分之四。（三）建設費由百分之十六增至百分之三十。（四）文化敎育費由百分之九點四。增至百分之十三點五。（五）衛生費由百分之五點二，增至百分之十點八。下半年度預算與上半年度之各項預算增加情形，（一）工務局主管，上半年實支五十一億六千二百萬元，下半年預算一百七十九億九千六百萬元，增加額爲一百廿八億三千四百萬元。（二）警察局主管，上半年四十六億三千四百萬元，下半年一百七十七億二千八百萬元，實增一百卅億九千四百萬元。（三）敎育局主管，上半年二十七億二千九百萬元，下半年一百六十二億三千九百萬元，實增一百卅五億一千萬元。（四）衛生局主管，上半年二十一億七千八百萬元，下半年一百三十六億一千二百萬元，實增一百十四億三千四百萬元。（五）公用局主管，上半年度九億一千萬元，下半年四十三億五千六百萬元，實增三十四億四千六百萬元。（六）地政局主管，上半年七億五千一百萬元，下半年卅一億三千一百萬元，實增廿三億八千萬元。（七）民政處主管，上半年十一億四千六百萬元，下半年二十九億七千六百萬元，實增十八億三千萬元。（八）財政局主管，上半年六億　八百萬元，下半年廿三億四千九百萬元，實增十七億四千一百萬元。（九）市府秘書處上半年八億一千五百萬元，下半年十七億五千一百萬元，實增九億三千六百萬元。（十）社會局主管，上半年三倍零八百萬元，下半年十三億一千九百萬元，實增十億一千一百萬元。谷局長報吿後，李文杰，朱扶九等紛提咨詢，三局長實予答覆，大多有關地政者。最後潘議長向審查小組指示二點：（一）市府預算中可能减省者，極力减省，如有增加必要者，亦可增加。（二）請該組負責人先立腹案，加緊審査工作。通過市府預算實爲參議會重要課題之一。審查小組今日繼續開會。</p>
<h3>中信局處理敵僞房屋　決展開複查工作　處理接收敵僞物資　統計總數已逾一萬億</h3>
<p>本市敵僞房地產自經敵僞產業處理局委託中央信託局統籌辦理以來，現已吿一段落，茲探錄該局處理敵僞房屋經過如次：敵僞房屋於勝利後，經各辦關先後住用，現經査明者，計：（甲）政府機關，一·中央機關使用一五三幢，二·地方機關使用五六幢·（乙）軍事機關，一·前三方面軍司令部四八幢，淞滬警備司令部廿九幢，後勤補給司令部七七幢，海軍司令部五一幢，其他軍事機關二七四幢。（丙）敎育文化機關使用二三一幢。（丁）後方各廠員工宿舍使用四五八幢。據悉其間因軍事機關變動較多，後有一部份佔用者，籍詞搪塞，避不解釋事實眞相，故中信局方面已決定展開複査工作云。</p>
<p>茲據滬光社記者探悉，敵僞產業處理局，即將縮小若干工作部門，並可能於三月後全部結束。據正式統計，處理局接收之敵僞物資，已逾一萬億元，其數約如下述：（一）現金十五億元，（二）原料成品（包括棉紗棉布人造絲）三〇〇〇億，（三）金銀首飾九〇〇億，（四）工廠三〇〇〇億，（五）房地產一〇〇〇億，（內房屋二一〇〇幢）地產（六三〇萬畝），（六）碼頭倉庫一二五六所一〇〇億，（七）德僑產業三〇〇億，（以德孚洋行爲最鉅佔二七〇億），（八）輪船一二〇〇艘一〇〇億，（九）糧食九七億，（十）文化事業（包括學院戲院電影塲報館五五億，（十一）金融機構八億，（十二）水產二五億，（十三）燃料二三億，（油料二〇〇〇桶，煤塊七〇五〇噸），（十四）有價證券十八億，（十五）傢俱十八億，（十六）農塲十五億，以上軍用品及逆產不計在內。業已成立之逆產管理委員會，將成爲一單獨機稱，處理有關逆產之一切事項云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕復興中路一九七至一九九號新泉池浴室，有舊工人一批，因不服社會局仲裁條件，於昨晚六七時左右，糾集大批流氓百餘名，　擁至該浴室，不問情由，將賬房曹洪三曁新工人餞士良。馬德良等毆傷十餘名，並攜毀玻璃窗桌椅等物，事後該管警局據報，立飭大批警員趕往圍捕，當塲拘獲肇事工人數名，受傷者由警舁送南洋醫院施治。</p>
<h3>不用「譯意風」干卿底事　新光戲院領票誣人為賊</h3>
<p>本市各首輪影戲院，於開映西片時，爲便利觀衆計，有「譯意風」之設備。昨日下午二時五十分許，寗波路新光大戲院「神鷹萬里」第一塲開映時，某領票發覺一觀客錯佔座位，適後來者至，即請其讓座，忽見該客租用之譯意風，並不套於耳際，而置於膝上，認有竊盜嫌疑，乃報吿該院負責人，將該顧客帶入老閘分局。據稱名黃菊臣，三十八歲，浦東人，棉布業，於二時許購券入塲，爲明瞭劇情起見，故向該院租用譯意風一隻，於開映後應用。孰知竟係損壞之物，聲息全無，此時全塲黑暗，戲已映過一半，不忍離座更換，故將譯意風置於膝上，不意被戲院方面誣良爲賊。又云，如本人將譯意風帶出戲院門外而被發覺，方可稱爲竊盜嫌疑，現正在觀戲之時，即使譯意風可以應用，而聰不聽也在於我。且置於膝上，並不藏於衣袋，遑論爲賊。警局以其言頗是，不予受理。茲悉黃以戲未終塲，而無故被帶出，特向戲院方面交涉退票。</p>
<h3>司賬被控侵佔　證據不足保釋</h3>

<h3>上海禽獸太少　吳正矱主張擴充動物園</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳參議員正矱，因鑒於動物園爲活動敎育材料，有益兒童常識，而現在上海唯一之動物園亦遭破壞，不加整頓，却以熊猫坐了專機直飛倫敦，不勝感慨，特請工務局趕用徵集或購買方式，充實原有動物園並增加新園。吳氏稱：八一三前，本市有動物園兩處，即文廟與兆體公園。後文廟受戰事影響，法工董局應吾當局之請，派兵將獅一對，雌虎·花豹·黑豹·巨蟒·黑熊各一頭，孔雀四頭，迎至法國公園避難，惜因氣候關係，巨蟒先凍斃，黑熊·黑豹及獅虎等又相繼染肺病而死。其間法人亦曾購買　魚·猴子及各種動物，後被敵軍移至兆豐公園。勝利後因管理不周，致大部動物均因營　不足而死云。</p>
<h3>市府財政預算及收支總項　與上半年度比較統計</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第九組召集人李參員文杰審査市府預算，特將財政預算及收支總項與上半年度比較統計，報吿如次：</p>
<p>現行房租房捐及市府交議提高房捐舉例計算：</p>
<p>如以戰前房租二十元計算！現房租增加一百四十倍，即爲二千八百元。房捐按戰前房租百分之十四計爲二元八角，現增加五百四十倍，共一千五百十二元，中央規定由房東一方負祖。市府擬於將來提高房捐後，則房租不改，房捐率加至百分之二十，倍數增加標準分甲乙丙三等，甲等共加至三千倍，乙等二千倍，丙等一千倍，如以丙計算，則二十元房租即徵收房捐四千元。由房東付五百六十元，房客付三千四百四十元，以示調整。</p>
<p>據李參議員個人意見：歲出與事業發展有關者市民應儘量支持市府，不主張核减，但行政方面費用應竭力减少，而减輕人民負担。</p>
<h3>僞造封條關防嫌疑　女校長被控收押　其夫李柏青訊後交保</h3>
<p>前本市十六區區長李柏靑，與其妻高葩建（現任淸華小學校長），曾於本年四月間，有僞造封條關防名片之嫌，並佔用南華新邨狄司威路裕新里，住房兩幢及哈同大樓寫字間，被業主向地檢處控吿，日前傳訊。李柏靑及妻高葩蓮應傳到案，據稱僞造封條並未使用，當庭李柏靑准予交保外，聞高葩蓮收押。（滬光社）</p>
<h3>會塲花絮</h3>
<p>吳市長口才的流利，大家都很佩服，祗是昨天說明預算編製經過時，「第二」說得太多，一個「第二」之後，又是一個「第二」，令人摸不淸他倒底說了幾點。</p>
<p>市長守時的精神永遠值頌揚，昨天上午審查大會是九點二十分開始的，他却在九點鐘差五分的時候一早就到了。</p>
<p>審核預算討論預算免不了數字的內容，一通串的幾億幾萬，增加多少，减少多少，百分比多少，倍數多少，講的人不得不講，聽的人聰得乏味，新聞記者尤感顯痛。不過可別輕視了這些枯燥的數字，今後短期內上海市每一家庭收支情况的改變都要受到它的影響。</p>
<p>路式導要市府少管閒事，他舉一個例說與其捉賭，還不如辦一所正當娛樂塲所。旁聽席上有人在議論說：「我看還是不捉比娛樂塲所更有效力吧！」</p>
<p>陶百川昨天又發警旬，他說：「現在上海的稅收（指筵席捐娛樂捐）是從那些在火山上跳舞的人荷包裏拿來的！」</p>
<p>季　討論到跑馬塲開放問題時說：「兩年後收回那是騙騙小孩子的話！」</p>
<p>參議員發言的技巧大有霄壤之別。精采的令人全神貫注，心　往之。冗長累贅的，聞之殊爲生厭。昨天有某參議員大贖其預先寫好的反對跑馬的演說詞，到了限定的時間還不肯結束，台下不少參議員鼓掌把他請了下來。</p>
<p>昨天各報館贈送報紙的特別多，每一張桌上都堆了一大疊，但記者席却根本失蹤了，記者們祇好各處「打游擊」，大有「記者不如報紙」之感。</p>

<h3>华茶外销危机迫　籲请速予有效救济　茶葉各團體函參議會市商會　四項主張請轉政府採納</h3>
<p>中國茶業協會，上海茶葉輸出業同業公會，上海市茶行商業同業等團體，爲呼籲挽救茶葉危機，特函上海市參議會市商會，提出四項主張，請轉達政府。其代電稱：上海市參議會市商會公鏖，査茶葉爲我國特產，與絲綢同具光榮的歷史，自昔行銷歐美，不獨利源所繫，亦且代表中華文物，馳譽世界，由來久矣。抗戰以來，農村凋敝，交通阻梗，不但海外市塲，羣茶絕跡，即國內銷量，亦因交通梗阻，日漸减少。今戰勝已及靑年，而國內生產，成本激增，交通狀况，仍未能多所改着。最近政府修改貨物稅條例，復將茶類列入，從價徵稅，恭聆之下，殊深惶駭。</p>
<p>徵貨物稅　先蒙實害</p>
<p>竊思我國茶葉，向係免徵統稅與出口稅，但納營業稅·所得稅·印花稅等，已屬繁重，且因國內成本日增，國際限價未除，內外價差，相懸益遠。國際茶葉市塲，競爭甚烈，如英國限制華茶進口數量，美國限制華茶價格，法國政府華茶進口禁令，猶未解除，均爲我國茶葉外銷前途之極大障礙，加之國內物價影響，成本無法减低，即就改訂之外匯率計算，對於茶葉外銷，實際裨益甚少。蓋在外匯調整以前，國外茶價，僅及國內成本三分之一，調整以後，仍不足成本二分之一，今政府方以取銷出口稅，獎勵輸出，爭取國際市塲，喚呼大號，中外具瞻，詎知茶葉外銷，原無出口稅，而於茶葉艱困萬分之際，突然新徵茶葉貨物稅，是使未沾虛惠，先蒙實害，益增茶農工商之負祖，而促成茶葉之總崩潰。</p>
<p>茶農無資　砍掘茶園</p>
<p>竊敝同業等，怵於戰後茶葉艱困實情，並鑒於國茶及時外銷爭取市塲之重要，早於去年十月，擬具計劃，籲請當局早定茶葉政策，籌措必需資金，免誤良機，奈奔走呼號，迄五月初旬，始由四聯總處籌撥專款，指定中國農民銀行舉辦茶貸，以資救濟。雖承中農當局，儘速籌劃，多方協助，惟茶貸數額，仍感供不應求，致茶商仍不免轉週於高利貸之下，成本愈昂，資金乏絕，至今不克精製成箱，外運應銷，夏茶更無力收購，產地茶農，採製無資，忍令貨棄於地，進而砍掘茶園，斬滅千百年歷史之國茶生機，行見華茶將永絕於國際市塲。本會同人，洞察危機，不容坐視，曾聯合同業，推舉代表，晋京向國民政府及各院部會陳流實際困難，請求立予有效救濟，迄今多日，未蒙採納施行。現以機勢日迫，不容旋踵，本會同人，一息尙存，不忍歷史產物，竟從此顚覆，謹再將同業仰期政府各點，瀝陳如次：</p>
<p>給予津貼　鼓勵出口</p>
<p>（一）給予出口津貼，鼓勵輸出，世界各國爲擴展或維持某種商品之海外市塲，多採出口津貼制度，以獎勵或補助商人。如印度爲英國之屬地，政府亦因國外茶價低於成本，已辦理茶葉出口津貼，如我國政府施策，竟不若印度政府，何以內對人民，外躋列強之林。蓋今茶葉之所以無法出口，全由於成本與官定匯率所形成之售價差額，故應請政府辦理出口津貼，輔助茶商，此種津貼，或以等級匯率爲調劑，或由國庫撥付，倘以限於預算，口鑽加若十種進口　　充之，如奢侈品及非必需品之進口附加稅，然後以其所得津貼茶葉出口，此實爲最合理最簡換之獎勵辦法。</p>
<p>茶葉易貨　換取物資</p>
<p>（二）續辦茶葉易貨，換取物資。抗戰初期，政府曾以茶葉與蘇聯易貨，並空駐美國接濟北非銷路，頗有相當成績。此種易易辦法，對於統制國際貿易之蘇聯，最爲適宜，前在抗戰時期，政府統購外銷茶葉時，國外茶價甚高，茶商所有外匯利潤，均貢獻政府，當時爲增强抗戰力量，均曾慷慨輸將。茲者茶葉外銷停頓，而蘇聯所需箱茶，爲數甚鉅，亟宜恢復對蘇易貨，以擴展國外銷路。又如法屬北非，需要華茶爲數亦鉅，如請法政府以安南之米煤相交換，或與埃及政府謀棉花茶葉之互易。此種易貨方式，直接可以獎勵兩國間貨物之交流，間接可以充裕米煤供應，平抑國內物價，　　　　投足之勞，絕對有利無損。</p>
<p>經濟外交　擴展市場</p>
<p>（三）運用經濟外交，擴展市場，現有若干國家，關稅頗有不利華茶之規定，如英國限制今年華茶進口數量，爲二百五十萬磅，僅爲一九三七年華茶輸英量之百分之二十，美國則因限制物價，對華茶限價極低，又如爲我國綠茶最大市塲之北非法屬塵洛哥，法政府有禁止華茶進口之命令，擬請政府循外交途徑，與各該國交涉，免除上述各種限制，以擴展華茶市塲。此外如非洲綠茶市塲中心之卡薩布蘭卡，尙朱設置領館，茶商因缺乏指導聯繫，貿易備受阻礙，亦製請儘速增設領館，以資保護，而利推進。</p>
<p>減輕成本　促進銷路</p>
<p>（四）豁免貨物稅，以輕成本。民國廿九年至三十年間，政府曾「度開征茶葉統稅，其時外銷茶葉，尙在統制期間，故僅限於內銷茶葉。嗣以茶葉內銷市塲甚狹，課徵煩細，茶葉同業不堪重負，即經呈准免徵茶葉統稅。今茶葉內外銷之形勢，較諸戰時，更感艱危，農村經濟，益呈破產，政府多方扶植，尙恐不及，若再加徵茶稅，增重負担，成本益高，出口無望。內銷組滯，徒使茶葉農商，如水益深，如火益熱，收益無多，於國何捕，故欲疎通茶葉銷路，必先减輕成本，而免徵茶葉貨物稅，亦所以先示倡導之旨也。素仰貴會代表民意，維護生產，夙具熱忱，用敢　掬實情，電懇據情轉達政府，一致呼籲，期蒙早賜採納，而挽茶業危辦，不勝企　之至。中國茶諜協曾理事長壽景偉，上海市茶葉　　　　　　　　事長唐季　，上海市茶行商業同業公會理事長黃燕堂，上海市茶業商業同業公會理事長鄭鑑源仝叩，申咸。</p>

<h3>民治建國會　洪門又一組織成立</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕洪門向爲我國歷史悠久之組織，惟以一切活動向不公開，故國人對其實際情形不甚明瞭，美國華僑之中，洪門弟兄居絕天多數，彼等於辛亥革命，旣極力協助國父，抗戰期間又踴躍輸將，地位自見重要。勝利之後，僑領司徒美堂朱家兆等聯袂回國，欲對國事作更進一步之實際努力，上海遂舉行洪門全球懇親大會，而司徒美堂等更有使彼等早在海外成立二年之致公黨，亦能於國內建立之意，並曾晋謁主席，旋因種種關係，改稱民治黨，月前並招待記者，正式宣吿成立，至於政綱，則着力於經濟方面之發展國營事業，保障民營事業，主要負責人爲司徒美堂，朱家兆，趙昱等，號稱擁有黨員三百餘萬人。</p>

<h3>陳周聿震啓　性病防治所一瞥　假如能够好好兒運用它　實在是一個理想的病院</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕雖說中秋已經過了，但是酷熱依舊，一點秋的氣息也沒有。唯一點綴着這個季節的是過了市的中秋月餅。</p>
<p>在這秋天裏的夏天，爲了明暸性病防治所的內容，記者第二踏上貝勒路。近午的太陽實在威武，把柏油路晒得軟棉綿的，我懷着滿腔的熱望，把一切都置之腦後忘去了頭頂的烈日，也忘去了空的肚子。</p>
<p>踏進性病防治所大門，迎接記者的是護士曲叔瑜，她第一句話就說：「呀，眞對不起，董寳機醫生又出去了，我們這兒的事情是只有他才知道的」。記者爲了不願意再跟第三次，所以接着說：「不要緊，我可以等候董醫生，順便參觀一下」。</p>
<p>於是曲小姐把記者領入一間辦公室，並且出示妓女檢騐統計表一紙，總計自一月至八月中。受檢查者二四七三各，檢査合格後發給執照者僅八九三人，普通的妓女智識水準都很低，即使患了性病，也都諱疾忌醫。她們之登門受檢査，全是由於警察局之强迫，並且大多認爲沒有這個必要。據曲小姐說：有的病情比較嚴重的，蔓延到腿部，形成了拐腿，經過打針吃藥，長期治療後，行路復原了，她還曾說，這是燒香拜佛的功效。接着，曲小姐又吿訴記者許多關於這些肉體出賣者的凄凉的身世，她們之願意操此賤業，幾乎純粹都是由於生活的鞭笞，更多的是爲了丈夫打仗死了，留下的孩子無力照應，於是當母親的使出賣自已來撫養孩子。也有許多被騙拐入地獄的，譬如父親死了，無錢成殮，於是做叔叔的便把未成年的姑娘賣入妓院，押了五十萬元錢，而這個固有的，至潔的靈魂，便不得不隨着歲月而腐蝕，一點點地染上了最要不得的性病。</p>
<p>曲小姐所訴述的慘絕人實的故事，是生活在天堂中的人們永遠想不到的。正當記者聽得出神的時候，這個新聞的中心人物—董寳機醫生來了，記者自然是喜出望外，因爲曲小姐曾說過：所中的實際情形和未來計劃都只有董醫生一個人知道。但是出乎意外地，董醫生對於記者拜訪似乎並不感到興趣，記者問他將來有什麽計　，他說：「目前的性病防治所，因爲材料與經費不够，無力擴充，將來希望對性病作有規則之管理，使它導入正軌」。　經過這次觀後，有一點還要向讀者報吿的，是性病防治所房屋建築的講究，高高的大洋房，四壁都綴以白色瓷磚。裘面一切設備非常完美，像這樣好建築的防治所，假若能够好好運用，實在是最合理想的　當記者從三樓（妓女檢驗處）下樓時，到處都是大門，竟然找不到一個出口處，突然一個老太婆橫豎了二道眉毛，對記者高嚷：「這邊走」！在她的指示下，我默默地離開了性病防治所，不禁暗暗地爲那些經當求治的妓女們倒抽了一口冷氣！圖示為妓女注射花柳病特效藥（本報攝）</p>
<h3>杭維翰等　視察海塘　南塘工程已告竣　北塘正在動工中</h3>
<p>本市海塘工程，自積極動工以來，不滿兩月，初步已吿完成，昨日上午八時，市工務局副局長王編　善，海塘工程總副隊長朱國洗·朱慶玉·市輸渡顧問工程師虞資侯等，陪同國防委員會黨政工作考核委員會委員杭維翰，並邀請市參議員等。至高橋視察海塘工程狀况，各參議員適逢昨日爲審査議案，不克分身，未曾參加，此項査勘之下，南塘方面張家村決口二百二十一公尺，戴家宅股陸家宅鄒家宅共爲一千二百四十四公尺，均已搶修完竣，以上各村莊，今日潮汎，可保無成。對於海塘工作人員辛勞，王副局長慰勉備至。關於北塘方面，正在動工中，限鑲吿竣，杭委員對於工程，詳細詢問，均由朱總隊長一一答復，至下午四時返滬。</p>
<h3>空軍在滬籌設　龐大供應機構</h3>
<p>空軍總司令部各部新機構，已在逐步成立中。茲悉統轄全軍供應事宜之空軍供應司令部，業已在滬進行籌備工作，由副司令郝中和上校率部屬先行來滬主持設營與接收事宜。該部一經成立，各地臨時性之器材接收機關，即行結束，因之該部組織相當龐大，計有六處三室四獨立科。所屬各單位主管人選，業已內定，籌備工作約於本月底可大部就緒。聞司令王衛民氏，於下月上旬，即可來滬視事。</p>

<h3>重大等六院校復員學生　向教部請求就學　昨在京招待記者報告經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南東十五日電〕重大·川大·貴大·雲大·貴醫·貴師·六院校復員學生留京滬代表，十五日上午十時，招待記者，報吿向敎部請求就學經過，認爲敎部對彼等五百餘人返鄕後求學問題，缺少關心，如彼等不催促，即「參加考試」之口惠，亦不可得。敎部各有關負責人，均互相推諉，而以復員各校容量已滿爲藉口，推翻在渝時「部令轉學」，「等於部令分發」之諾言。彼等以爲如眞「容量已滿」，考試實僅係欺騙，况考期迄今渺渺。重大在二十日，貴大在廿八日，均將開學，大有兩次落空之慮。彼等十六日開全體代表會後，將進見朱部長，請求二事：（一）維持原議，分發各校轉學，如須依學業審核，應與臨大之分發，同一標準（七十分以上）。（二）因此事懸而不決，致原校缺課超限，返原校亦生困難時，應負責設法解決。渠等吿記者，實不願如臨大同學，以罷課遊行作手段，以達目的，至盼教部能接受渠等合理請求。</p>
<h3>浙省參議員建議　積極推進教育　提高敎育經費預算百分比</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州訊」此次浙省參會開會，一部份參議員，即建議積極推進本省敎育事業，其辦法爲：（一）增設國民學校，務使達到一保一校之目標，並依照規定，開辦成人班及婦女班。（二）普設中等學校及職業學校，並儘量添設班級，擴充學額。（三）保障敎師生活，並提高師資。（四）特別注意兒童品性之陶冶及體格之鍛鍊。（五）增加公費生名額爲百分之二十至百分三十。（六）酌减學雜費用，並規定分期徵款辦法，以輕家屬負担。（七）提高省市縣敎育經費預算之百分比。（八）加緊推行捐資與學運動，同時確定國民學校經常費之籌集辦法。（九）政府繼續辦理貸學運動，以助貧寒子弟入學。</p>
<h3>成都大學生　爭考警察</h3>
<p>〔成都訊〕此間水上營察所，招考警士，報名者甚爲踴躍，在投考之五百餘學生中，大學修業者佔十分之一，高中畢業者佔十分之四，初中畢業者佔十分之五，打破歷來警察素質之空前紀錄。據該所負責人談：此次警士之有大學高中學生參加，誠屬可喜現象，但恐係迫於生計，暫時謀一枝棲，非對警察工作眞有誠心長幹，一且另有辦法，未必不即辭去，殊亦令人憂慮。</p>
<h3>貸學金近訉</h3>
<p>國貨市塲今開結束會議　章錫彭昨慨捐一百萬元</p>
<p>上海市敎育貸金委員會主辦之國貨市塲，於五日結束後，各廠商及各校之手續，尙有少數未淸，以致數目未能如期公佈，惟截至目前止，已收到現款約二億五千六百萬元正。現經濟保管會，已定今日（十六日）開結束會議，確定廠商提成貸學成數。又各負賣推銷之大中學校，如震且·大夏·聖約翰·滬新·育英·民立·新本·中國·中法·同義·省吾·中華職業等，仍未將推銷所得現款曁餘券繳會，聞現已由該會函催上列各校尅日前往結算，大概在數日內該會總收入，即可結淸公布云。</p>
<p>貨金原則　略有變更</p>
<p>又訊：申請生調查審核工作，業已就緒。現因該會審核處長王徵君飛盧。參加靑年團全代大會，一俟王氏日內回滬，作最後決定後，即可公佈，並通知各校。惟據該會負責人談：本屆貸金之核准與否，除家境淸寒爲基本條件外，服務成績最佔重要，並以每校徵募所得百分之八十，作爲該校貸金原則。該會以本屆徵募所得，與原定目標，距離尙遠，除函請體協會舉辦球類義賽外，現正分頭向社曾各界熱心助學人士勸募中。日昨承德和洋行童錫彭，慨捐一百萬元，深堪敬佩。</p>
<p>可向肄業　學校申請</p>
<p>聞本市淸寒學生，向敎育貸金委員會申請貸金者，約一萬餘人。該會本屆貸金收入甚徵，難以應付，故本學期貸金生學費問題，頗爲各界人士所注意。現悉：該項貸金生，肄業於本市私立各校者，多已獲得學校之免費許可，其未獲免費之學生，仍可向肄業學校申請云。</p>
<h3>中法大學改稱　稚暉大學　李石曾張靜江等主張</h3>
<p>〔央社北平十五日電〕由委李石曾在平，對記者談：中法大學，將按渠與張靜江等，所主張之世界大學意見，改稱稚暉大學，上海亦將設立稚暉大學。關於平研究院原子研究所，僅硏究原子能原子彈，應由軍事機關硏究。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十五日電〕據美國稚暉大學華僑敎育硏究所長　允征談：稚暉大學在紐約，有世界學院，世界合作學院，獨立中國言語學系，及華僑敎育硏究所等四部門，並將設立中國文化學院，學生二百餘人，多爲美籍。華僑教育硏究所附設小學，有學生三百人，以畢　子弟爲多。稚暉大學，在紐約市郊購地卅畝，正募款修建校會。</p>
<h3>胡適發表意見　訓導制度　不應控制思想　工醫兩院　應各延長年限</h3>
<p>〔本報北平訊〕北京大學校長胡適博士頃對記者發表意見：北大之創辦工學院行五年制，醫學院爲七年制，係參酌部今辦理，按照部令，醫學院可以辦六年至八年，因一般的工學院及醫學院功課及要學習的太多，所以各延長一年。法律系本年度不會有六年制之議，但爲硏究的需要，也是要延長的。延長年限，當然要報部備案。至於訓導制度問題。北大已成立訓導委員會，本人意見，認爲訓導制度，不應用以控制學生思想，拘束學生，事實上亦不易收拘束之效。如用以對學生的體格·學問·行爲三方面，作一指導與幫助·訓導制度之意義，則可加以發揮，現已由訓導委會擬具辦法中。</p>

<h3>郝更生視察報告　東北教育情形　日籍敎授表示因係戰敗國自願滅低待遇　徐誦明表示學術無國界敎授待遇無軒輊</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕敎部聘任督學郝更生，頃將視察東北敎育情形，備又呈報敎部，茲將一部分視察報吿探誌於下：</p>
<p>設有演習林　廣一萬公頃</p>
<p>（一）國立東北大學：該校原有校舍，戰前九一八，被日軍佔作營房。去年勝利之初，客軍駐入，未幾撤退，國軍未到，地方情形複雜，並有附近民衆入校掠奪，學校圖書與敎學設備，被刧一空，直至最近，尙有失業工人，不時組織拆房隊，夜間成羣結隊，幸現在已增强保護力量，以免再度損失。皆年更生所計劃建築之大體育塲，一度變爲日軍養馬塲所，塲內所有鐵攔及鐵門，盡被日軍運回，改製軍用品。光復後，該校校具被人運走甚多，聞曾用卡車五十輛載運六晝夜，而全部校舍被破壞者，計達十分之七八，現正在鳩工修葺中，以期於本年秋季開學時應用。該校各學院之設置，尙能與部令所指示者相合，文法理工學院，將就原址恢復。農學院，擬利用僞滿所辦之農業大學校舍，全院所佔面積約有一百公頃，牛房馬廐等設備俱全，另於吉林臨江縣，設有演習林，廣一萬公頃，佔全縣面積之半。該校全部修理費用，的計需二億元流通券，已由該校向部呈請中。</p>
<p>主持者努力　情況尚良好</p>
<p>（二）東北大學先修班：該班學生有三千四百五十餘人，內有女生六百三十餘人，此輩均來自二百六十餘中學，來源複雜，程度參差，所幸環境尙好，曾將校外一部份日本民房作爲宿舍，學生生活得以安定。該　主要料目，每這國文，英文，各五小時，公民，地，史，化，理，生物，各二小時，科樂一小時，體育二小時，文史組則國文多二小時，理化組則數學多二小時。敎職員共一百十餘人，其中職員約五十人，賴主持者之努力，情况尙屬良好。</p>
<p>一死於霍亂　一死於肺病</p>
<p>（三）　陽　時大學補習班：該班有學生三千餘人，來自專科以上學校者，計有一百六十單位，學生學歷不同，故永準亦不一致，敎學頗感困難。復以學生衆多，宿舍飯廳，皆成問題，現借用瀋陽醫學院一部份校舍，當視察時，曾有一學生死於霍亂，又有一生死於肺病。該校有學生八九百人，來自僞滿各大學及專科學校者十四單位，最近感覺環境不宜，已請求該班准許，離潘陽去長春，等候轉入將成立之長春大學，故班內一切情况，尙不易走上軌道。至於經費，至本年七月初止，祇由本部領到國幣二千萬元。</p>
<p>顯微鏡一項　尚存八百架</p>
<p>（四）國立瀋陽醫學院：即前滿洲醫科大學，內分大學部，專門部，及預科，與藥學專門科四部門，歷史悠久，規模已具。現敎職員方面，除主持藥學專科之日人，因品行不端，已被辭退外，其餘費歷良好之日籍敎師，多將留用。全校有日本敎授，副敎授，及講師四十三人，我國副敎授四十七人。另有附屬醫院，護士中國籍二十一人，日籍一百零九人，日籍職員二十三人，藥局技師五人，院警十二人，工友一百二十餘人。校內設備，相當充實，就顯微鏡一項而言，在勝利之初，被人搬去七十餘架，現尙存有八百架。又附屬醫院，原有病床八百張，亦於光復之際，被人運走四百張。該校過去數月，因無正式主持人，致校內曾發生許多枝節問題。最近徐誦明院長到職，校中行政已有中心，一切逐漸步入正軌，富有經騐之日篇敎授，多願留校任敎，並表示因係戰敗國之敎授，其待遇不應與我國敎授相等。但徐院長以爲學術無國界，敎授待遇，應無軒輊，現校內各方面，均稱融洽安定。該校本年經費，自四月份起，至七月份止，領得九百五十萬元之流通券。發薪每月需三百萬元，已發放三次。一切房舍修繕，墻壁拆補，及淸理水道工程，動則需流通券數十萬元，目前經費極窘。醫院收入最初每日只收三千餘元之流通券，近則每日可收二萬元以上。關於由瀋陽鐵路醫學院，改稱國立瀋陽醫學院之經過，與學制改革，及經費接濟等問題，徐院長已另有詳細報告，呈部核奪。</p>
<p>教職員服務　精神不稍減</p>
<p>（五）遼寗醫學院：原名小河沿施醫院，係私立敎會學校。光緒八年，英人司督閣爵士來瀋所創辦，幾經變易，改稱遼寗醫學院，設備尙稱完整，賴學校有關人士竭力維護周旋，故未被破壞，亦云幸矣。現在校學生計有一百七十九人，內女生三十八人，學院經費，因私立性質，來源漸　，而　職員　心服務精神，乃不稍减，殊堪嘉許。該院對於潘陽一般民衆醫療服務可謂有口皆碑，三等病房，每日伙食醫藥等費，祇需流通券八十元，二等病房每日一百五十元，頭等病房每日二百元，此乃眞正爲社會服務。該校敎授待遇，至今每月僅七八千元流通券，（普通大學敎授，每月約一萬二千元）。</p>
<p>學生曾護校　設備未毀壞</p>
<p>（六）瀋陽師資訓練所：該所為本部靑年轉導處所舉辦，分三個月畢業，與六個月畢業者兩期，有男生三百餘名，女生約七十名。經費短少，頗不敷用。該所敎學，係採取中央訓練團方式與制度，精神表現，與敎學設備尙佳。（七）瀋陽靑年轉導處中學進修班：亦爲本部靑年輔導處所舉行，學生七百二十餘人，女生約九十人。每月經費，亦不充足。班址爲前南滿中學所在地，（日人對該校極爲注意，因過去此校係訓練南滿鐵路下級工作人員），原南滿中學學生轉學於該班者，約二百八十餘人，曾發起護校運動。該校設備尚未毀壞，原南滿中學學生，英文程度，在該班中較佳。該班博物理化，設備尙全。前主辦南滿中學之校長爲日人，曾留學美國者。</p>

<p>上海市敎育局，爲謀復興木市敎育，隨時力謀改進起見，亟擬組織教育考察團，以資偕鏡，爰特擬具提案，請市參議會公決。茲將是項提案探誌於下：</p>

<h3>證交今日正式開拍　昨招待記者說明改革情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證劵交易所已定今日上午十時正式開拍，暫時僅做前市交易，每日自上午十時起，至十二時止，下午五時起，則舉行集體對帳，各情已迭誌本報，昨日下午四時，證交當局特再舉行茶會，招待本市新聞界，到該所總經理王志莘，協理楊蔭薄·顧美昌，主任秘書華文煜，經理陳績孫，副總理張積三·沈稔三等重要職員，及各報社記者卅餘人，席間由王總經理一一介紹該所重要職員，並至詞稱：今日承諸位光臨，極感榮幸。本所自九月九日開幕以來，以演習交易及對帳手績，同時等待政府頒佈交易稅徵收辦法，與核定經紀人保證金代用品部分繳納辦法，至遲至十六日方能正式開拍。今日先行聚會，擬說明本所各種手績，並聆取各位教言。此次本年制度設備，事前仔細參考各種辦法，而經決定，相信是前進的。初辦時或有未慣，惟深信必能達到敏捷正確之境地。</p>
<p>場務計算均加革新</p>
<p>繼由楊協理致詞稱：業務處與明日（十六日）開拍有直接關係者，為場務科主管實際市場之交易；計算科則主管當日經紀人買賣之清算，以便次日執行交割。此次因經紀人名額之增加，舊有設備與辦法，頗多須加增設及改訂之處，以適應事實上之需要。</p>
<p>就場務方面言之，最重要之改革，則為「分櫃相對買賣」之採行。此項辦法，由籌備委員會經周密研究與考慮所訂定。蓋在參加交易人數激增之情況下，非設法增加交易地位，不足以資應付。分櫃之最主要目的，即在分散交易地點，以增加交易面積。以環形替代直綫，以分櫃替代集中，籌備委員會所定此項辦法，高度利用有限地位，確是一大進步。但此項辦法，與從前「華商證判劵」所採行之普通相對買賣，及「衆業公所」所採行之黑板制度，均不盡相同。初試時，雖免因不習慣不熱練而略感不便，亦為改革中必經之過程。經幾度演習，並酌加改進以後，交易已能順利進行。謝改進各點：（一）為市場四角「行市板」所寫數字之加大。（二）「行市板」改寫買進及賣出價格。（三）交易櫃添置之黑板，同時公佈，買進及賣出行市。（四）調整各上市證劵交易櫃地位，使各櫃間，易於連洛。</p>
<p>就計算方面言之，計算方式，亦有改革。從前所有計算工作，由交易所於營業時間後行之。需極多人手，（曾到過一百二十餘人）漏夜工作，間沿不能「軋平」。現經紀人數倍增，對帳複雜情形，隨以增加。即倍加計算人員，事實上仍不易應付。因參酌銀行票據交換辦法，規定集體對帳制度。由經紀人派員，於指定時間，齊集市場，當場互相對帳，「軋平」差額。幸賴各經紀人之多方合作，經數日演習，手績已漸臻純熟。總之，交易所業務，複雜紛繁，千頭萬緒，以今日有限之物質條件，衹有逐漸謀不斷之改進，希望諸位多多指教。</p>
<p>審查標凖漲跌限度</p>
<p>該所王總經理，楊經理等答復各報社所提問題如下：（一）上市股票，均須申請經審查合格，方准上市，此次經審查合格者共有二十種，其標凖為內容股實及在市面上已有流通，所謂熱門股，惟均屬試行上市性質：（二）為防止暴漲暴跌影響整個金融起見，對於上市股票之漲跌，經呈准當局規定限度，一，般票價格在一百元以下者，升降限度為百分之二十，二，一百元以上至五千元以下者，為百分之十五，三，五千元以下者為百分之十，每種股票升降限度由交所於交易櫃前，逐日懸牌公佈，每日只有一個限度，所有成交價格不得高於公佈限度之高價或低於公佈限度之低價，證劵價格升降，如達此限度，交所得呈准停止一部，或全部證劵之買賣停止交易之時間長視情形而定。</p>
<p>先做現期次日交割</p>
<p>股票交易分現期及定期兩種，戰前證劵交易，以定期為主，現期交易為輔。今日開拍，衹做現期交易，當日成交各買賣須於當日軋平，而於次日交割清訖，買方至遲應於次日上午十二時前，將價款繳所，賣方至遲，應於次日下午三時前將證劵繳所。</p>
<p>暫定經手費收率</p>
<p>該所又發出股票市場公告第五號稱：「本所經手費用之徵收率暫定如下，股票買賣經手費，雙方經紀人各收貨值之千分〇·七五，每筆交易買賣經紀人為同一人時，及內轉帳交易，衹收一方千分之〇·七五，」又第六號公告云：「各經紀人向買賣兩方委託人徵收之佣金，在經紀人公會尚未組織成立，擬定佣金率報由本所轉報核定前，暫定股票佣金率為千分之三。」</p>
<p>最後各報社記者會就交易辦法，杜絕交易所投機操縱，及取締黑市交易等技術問題發問，由王總經理等，分別根據該所編概述及營業細則等，一一答覆，迄六時許，始告散會。</p>
<h3>長江客貨偷盜嚴重　輪船業應負責防護　商會懇切勸告毋使個商竊笑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會寫據海味雜貨及北貨兩商業公會函稱，略以所屬各會員，向長江中上游渝宜漢潯一帶，採辦木耳，湘蓮，榨菜，針菜，桃肉以及各種北貨雜貨等產品，交各輪船公司裝運抵滬至倉庫提貨時，每被中途偷失，其中意有缺少至一二成以上者，致辦商損失不貲等語。商會當據情分函招商局，大達，三北，民生等輪船公司，及上海市港務管理委員會等，略稱：查民法第六百卅四條，運送人對於運送物之喪失，除不可抗力外，應負責任。海商法第九十七條亦有相同之規定。偷竊行為，既非人力不能防止之事，船公司依法實有應負之責任，斷難藉詞推諉。即按照船公司服務工商之責任觀念而論，一方既以收回船權，苦口號召，冀得舉世之同情。一方既應以肅清積弊，樹立楷模，慰工商界之期望。事屬相應，理無偏廢。否則徒使國民痛心，外商竊笑。用特據情剴切奉商，務希貴公司等以坦白懇摯之態度，為勇於負責之表示，誥誡員工，切實流止。務使中途偷盜客貨之惡習，勿再見於勝利來臨，航權收回之後云。</p>
<h3>公債何時開拍　財部在審核中</h3>
<p>上海證劵交易所復業後，各種產業證劵業經審定，今日將先行上市開拍，惟政府公債何時上市，尚未見公佈，頃據財政部負責人稱：證劵交易所，現當復業之初，先將產業證劵上市交易，其主要目的，在使產業資金，得以流通週轉，並藉以吸收游資，至政府在戰前及戰後所發行各種公債，其上市先後，應參酌各債情況，與市場狀態，妥善審定，現交易所已依照上市證劵通則及其營業細則之規定，呈請核定，公債之上市種類，本部正在詳慎審核中，一俟枋定，當即令知該所辦理云。</p>
<h3>證劵交易稅條例　立法院三〇七次大會通過</h3>
<p>第一條，凡在交易所貿賣有價證劵依本條例征收交易稅</p>
<p>第二條，交易稅按買賣約定價格征收之，其稅率如左。</p>

<h3>仿告古瓷　遭外人指摘</h3>
<p>〔合衆社舊金山十四日電〕澳洲電台今日廣播稱：來自上海之英國海員云，偽造之中國古代瓷器正在世界各地銷售，此種廠品惟專家始能鑑別。此種詐欺賣賣在中國極為盛行，無賴商人獲利無算云。</p>
<h3>政府重視邊省茶政　設廠製造磚茶</h3>

<h3>港已禁布出口　與中國無關者除外</h3>

<h3>安記證劵號　今日正式開業</h3>
<p>上海證劵交易所二二四號經紀人安記證劵號，由聶麟祥呂佑生經理，專營證劵買賣，定於今日正式開幕，聶呂兩君經營證劵，夙以穩健敏捷見稱，而觀察走勢，分析入微，尤為客戶所悅服，此番合作，可謂相科益彰，該號號址在證劵大樓二三七號，電話九六一六一云。</p>
<h3>紗布出口　管理辦法擬議中　華面走私路綫水陸俱有</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃晤紡織事業管理委員劉文騰氏，叩以擬訂管理紗布出口辦法情形，據告：該項辦法，刻正縝密審訂中。現方積極徵集各方意見，以謀集思廣益，俾管理辦法擬就後，能面面適用。渠稱：在國內對紗布供應尚未恢復正常狀態前，不得不暫採管理出口辦法，以維持國內紗布平價之原則。一旦生產增加，供過於求，則非但不加管理，尚將獎勵出口，至外傳紗傳布走私華南之事，內幕情形相當複雜。聞本市紗布之出口，一部固經過海關，惟一部取道漢口，經由粵漢路而達廣州。另一部取道金華旱路，轉運廣西。此二路均不經過海關。該會現正密切注視中。必要時，將派人員赴廣州一帶，調查紗布實銷情形，以明真相云。</p>

<h3>標凖法草案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部為促進各種貨品，尺度，符號，名稱等之標凖華起見，已擬具標凖法草案，提交法院，經法制經濟兩股聯合審查，業已通過，茲將是項草案錄下：</p>
<p>第一條　本法所稱標凖，係依標凖制定程序所制定全國共同遵守之國家標凖。</p>
<p>前項標凖制定程序，由經濟部定之。</p>
<p>（一）各種單位名稱定義符號及常數</p>
<p>（二）各種品質及尺度標凖</p>
<p>（三）各種試騐法標凖</p>
<p>（四）各種關係互換性能之標凖</p>
<p>（五）各種安全標凖</p>
<p>（六）其他應遵守之標凖</p>
<p>第三條　經濟部設中央標凖局棠經兩國各種標凖事宜。</p>
<p>第四條　全國共遵守之標凖，應由中央標凖局依照標凖制定程序制定，呈請經濟部核准公布。</p>
<p>第五條　凡適合標凖之產品及方法，呈經中央標凖局審查合格後加（正）字標記，以資識別。</p>
<p>第六條　凡自行制造或輸入輸出之貨物，及所使用試騐方法，應合規定標凖，其推行辦法，由經濟部定之。</p>
<p>第七條　中央標凖局，為推行度量衡標凖制度，得呈准經濟部帛定各種草行規章。</p>
<p>第八條　凡以詐偽方法，朦請審查或濫用標凖之（正）字標記者，以詐欺論罪。</p>
<p>第九條　本法自於公布日施行</p>
<h3>劣鈔衹收不發換發精美鈔票</h3>
<p>中央銀行以抗戰時期物資缺乏，為配合需要所發行之鈔票不得不採取一紙一版方法致流行市面未免式樣較多現為簡化起見決將印刷不精，紙張欠佳之鈔票，實施只收不發制度，使流通額逐漸遞減，並採選庫存中一千元二代替發行以杜假胃及紙張破爛諸弊至以一百元二百元四百元五百元一千元及二千元各種票版原套改良，仍以物資所限一時尚難實現。</p>
<h3>紡管會即日　復查民營工廠</h3>
<p>經濟部紡織事業管理委員會經擴大組織後，對於計劃，亦已擬訂，該部前民營紡織廠之調查，將予復查，如有虛設及不良情事，將報部依法取締。</p>
<h3>評價愈估愈高　工廠不易接辦</h3>
<p>關於政府對後方工業家優先配售工廠二十二家一事，因經濟部蘇浙皖區特派員，敵偽產業處理局，與中央信託局等三主管方面，不相一致，廠基評價三易其值，價格愈估愈高，川黔工廠聯合會爰特建議召集一聯席會議，俾對估價及接管手續等從長計議，以減少接辦工廠時之困難，現正積極向各有關主管機關進行商洽云。</p>
<h3>當局將劃一管理錢兌業</h3>
<p>本市錢兌業歷史悠久，其主管機關迄未核定，茲悉財部方面頗為重視，已準備劃一管理，同時對於該業所經營之業務，業擬予以嚴密約束，以免影響金融之安全，又以錢兌業並非正式錢荘，凡混用錢荘牌號者，當予取締。</p>
<h3>除息除權　交割上的小困難</h3>
<p>— 欽</p>
<p>怱忙中將證交所頒營業細則約略翻閱一過，對第五十七條所載「股票於停止前一日之交易，為除息交易。其除息載除權，由本所公告之」。關於債劵只要將息票剪下，就可以了。惟對於股票，則事實上有點麻煩了，過去的經騐告訴我們，各公司廠商在召開股東會之前，必先登報週知，停止過戶。除息或除權，手績非短短的成交後一日可以辦妥。有些公司廠商，往往故意想將本身之股票價值拉抬，在發息或認權時期，將股東的股票，對閉一較長時期。若照此條規定，前一日之賣方，事實不能從容於次日交割前取得彼應收之股息，或應得之權利。此一技術上之問題，不知所方有否代賣方收息取權之凖備。否則交割上必將發生困難，望所方早日規定。</p>

<p>諸位如果心情愉快，坐在外灘公園欣賞黃浦的浪潮，起伏有激，沖激岸石，傾聽它笛奏，心弦撥邊，你的情緒將更幽美，如果心情惡劣，也未當不可在此一掃愁思。可惜的是黃浦太窄，船艦雲集。市聲慎囂，已失却純粹自然之美。</p>
<p>控扼七十二水　只剩一方公里</p>
<p>正陽關就不然。本來它北濱淮河，西濱渒水；西對岸是一條穎川，都北黃浦寬大得多，秋雲帆影，殺地萬頃，一望無際，身臨其境，實在賞心悅目，皖西北各川匯此東流，據說有七十二水之多。正陽關扼川原之利，可說是一個「魚米之鄉」。以此自傲的地方，在中國並不多，扼七十二水以為吞吐的華中重鎮，却只此一個。</p>
<p>可是自從黃水奪道穎川東下之後，正陽關遭遇到同民國廿年相同的洪水浩刦，險此兒宣告全部陸沉，除開幾棟屋子外，不見一點農作，我昨天到達這裏，坐了小劃子開到一家旅館的後門口登上珍貴的陸地，發現正陽關四面都是水，變成一個孤島，穎·淮·渒水，已經分辮不清。最嚴重的時候，正陽關露出於水面的不到一方公里，現在水勢較落，可以在不到一方公里多的小陸上不致濕脚走路。</p>
<p>這一塊大地上棲息着三萬居民。我在水與陸的邊沿走了一周，自然不費多大功夫。眺望邊方，水天一色，如果不在水裏露出幾個屋脊或樹梢，必將徽然以為所處的地方是在海的彼岸。我正走過一塊榮園，就是所說的水與陸的邊沿，被水浸得稀爛的泥已沒過脚踝，浪頭沖激過來，又捲去一大片泥，浪花濺到五六尺高，這片土地的邊沿還這樣的被剝蝕着，而建築物擊垮磚牆，剩下傾側的屋架。其聲勢實在駭人，使我戰戰兢兢，生怕水勢突漲，一湧而上，逃也來不及，一切都被捲將進去。我頗以為這樣大的水，對付這小小一方公里多的土地已不是難事了，只一口就為吞了下去。</p>
<p>黃河鯉魚南來災民幽默垂釣</p>
<p>那些同我站在一起，眺望遠方万故居—現在只膽屋脊上的孩子們，沉默無語，浪花打在他們的身上，也殘酷地打擊着他們天真的夢，為之黯然。那些小劃子載滿農民，勇猛地在浪濤中攅行，拜訪他們的家園。的確所有的標落已經陷落，只有仍然膽下一小塊孤島，他們就住在小島上，每日惟　首以舉雲天，他們不想政府，不想慈善家，只冀望洪水早退，俾得再打起精神掙扎自已刼後餘生．這樣的小島羣大約彼此相隔至少五華里，多則十餘里，星羅棋佈，所以我站在正陽關這大孤島上，目力所及，去瞭望這個「海」．就看不到幾個係上面所說的小島了，只見那些勇猛的小划子轉過着青的柳梢，一剎那間，壓落在「海」的盡頭處。</p>
<p>我的居處灘水不過十公尺，數天前屋子裏已浸滿了水，牆脚上的水印宛然，現在水勢略退，地上滿舖石灰，遂可安頓。可是十公尺外就是「海」，浪濤日夜不絕，正在猛烈攻擊着磚牆的屋子，一分鐘要打上四十個浪頭，一垜墻已經支不住而垮掉，而攻擊還沒有終止。</p>
<p>可是，我在正陽關吃到黃河鯉魚，每斤四百元，這當然要感謝「黃河之水天上來」了。有些居民因為產子裏浸滿了水，擱上木板才可走動，進出則自然用船隻，無事可為，只好坐在門口垂釣，態度悠閒，之真是懂得生活的幽默者。</p>
<p>明代羊石舊關　稅吏猶承遺風</p>
<p>正陽關，古稱羊石。泰州志云：「正陽關在州西南六十里。正陽臨陸路東通府城，南通六安州，西南通霍邱縣，下通洪澤湖，明成化元年設關。」另據食貨志載：「正陽關額徵稅銀六萬二千四百四十六兩三錢六毫五絲。」</p>
<p>現而只有縣貨物稅局的一個徽收處，可是目前在這一個孤島上，有什麼貨物稅徽收呢？而辦事人員將近二十員名，不合正規，好像他們並不恐怕蝕本。我所乘的船靠近正陽關時，就有一個身穿短打，一身紡綢衫褲的脚色，自小划子上跳到船上，到處亂鎖，緊張極了，這是什麼邪是什麼的亂摸亂問，嚇得那些鄉巴佬誠惶誠恐，結里結巴。同船的一位先生對我說：「你不知道，他們以任何方式可以徽收的，鄉巴佬罽沒有智識。」後來，我又知道正陽關鎮上，每一家商店都要向鎮公所奉徽所謂保甲捐之類，看舖面大小而定，每月一兩萬五六萬不等。難道這些商家都是鄉巴佬嗎？如有病死的散兵游勇，鎮公所又有了題目，又是按家攤派，而這些商家總是先訴苦，後敷衍，結果總是出錢。</p>
<p>只靠一圈城牆圍住一圈乾土</p>
<p>現在還是回說到正陽關，這個關彷佛一座兩層的鼓樓，不過鼓樓下面往往是城洞，而這則是一座石塊築成的台，其高度等於整個建築之半，外附石級，可以循級登關。這歷史遺物現在當然十分殘破，而且石台已完全浸沒花水裏，我坐了船才看到它的正面，現在已用不到抬級而上，船就可以開進去。</p>
<p>清人全椒王肇奎會有「過正陽河」一詩：「立馬關津口，叫人喚渡船；舟經渾似葉，水漲欲連天。老屋露擔脊，游魚浮樹顛；茫茫生百感，落日下蒼烟。」都仍切今日的景色，不過當時還能「立馬關津口」，雖然魚已經上了樹頭，但水勢還不算大的。也可見馳道仍通，可以立馬叫渡，現在我却可以行舟上關。而公路都浸在水裏，離水面數丈。剛剛我碰一羣交通部派來修復自六安到周家口國道的工程師，他們被逼只好等在這孤島上，無事可為。據說這路已經初步勘測，須土八十萬方，修橋五十六座。一位姓孫的段長已在阜陽途中被武裝搶刦了一頓，據說冒充軍隊云。</p>
<p>唐人宋之問「初宿淮口」詩云：「夜聯楚歌思欲斷，況值淮南木落時。」也在此地，不過他在思鄉，與我們無涉。可是皇甫再詩云：「……日夕烟霜那可道？詩陽西去水無窮！」他不過是作文學上的誇張，現在看來，真變成了予言。豈但是壽陽西去，現在壽縣就靠一圈城牆，圍住一圈乾土。壽縣民衆在重溫歷史的舊課，奈何？</p>
<p>重溫歷史舊課　斯民命共魚蝦</p>
<p>正陽關屬壽縣，它的鄉土史原是水災與刀兵交織的紀錄。</p>
<p>「永樂已丑，淮水泛漲，淝河淤塞，潴水成湖，連年為西北城垣之害，隨修隨毀，曾無虛歲。正統丁巳夏五月初旬，陰雨連綿，三旬不止，淮淝貫通，硤口之口逼窄，奔流不徹，遂將四門閉塞，搬運土木，以遏水患，雉堞不沒者僅三尺許，耆稚騒然驚悸；揮使劉侯，急調遞運船隻及拘客商舟經，先將老弱者濟之於淮山這　,少壯者移處東南城垣之高卓，人民得安。繼而六月朔日，西北風大作，巨浪衝擊城垣，坍塌七百九十八丈，泊岸六千六百五十餘尺，樓櫓木石，一時蕩盡。」（明羅織壽州衛重修城櫓記）</p>
<p>「嘉靖中葉，黃河改道，洪濤自徐沛分流於淮淝，過濠泗以達海，始逆濠過緩，河塵湖心，淤且十九。間歲盛夏，暴霖屢作，英，六，汝，穎，狂瀾復下，　口勢遏，潢潦漫渟，連山隱樹，一望無涯，水之迫近城　者止餘尺許，風吹浪撼。斯民驅命產業，直於魚蝦共之。」（明謝腫增培土城記）</p>
<p>「嘉靖丙寅，大水破城，居民葬魚腹中者不可勝計。」（清謝開寵重修壽州城記）</p>
<p>「順治六年，淫雨，大水圍城，不及垛口尺許。城圯者千有餘丈。」「同治五年大水，不及壞口者尺許。」（壽州志）</p>
<p>今年則又是重溫舊課：「不及垜口尺許。」民國廿年已經溫過一次了。大抵准上水災，不是淮水本身暴漲，即是共河奪道，但推溯其根源，則還在黃河。</p>
<p>清人孫家鼎有去：「道光年間，黃河屢決口，由二水趨准，挾泥沙而下，淮流因之受病，於是壽之下游，如懷遠，臨淮，五河，旴眙等縣，凡淮流所經行者悉淤墊，失建領之勢，不能暢流，而壽之受水患也更甚。」</p>
<p>詢諸父老，證之歷史，居民納帑增城修堤，數千年來，幾無虛歲，消耗大量的物資和勞力，不可謂未曾竭盡智力，然而黃淮是一個大問題，不是一方居民可以略挽於萬一。民國廿年的水災是由於淮河水漲，今年則是黃水奪道，又挾泥沙以俱來，淮河河床將更增淤積，倘以後水漲，則災情自心更加嚴重，殆無可疑。但今日停舟正最關上，北望大川，水天無涯，徒增感慨而已！</p>
<p>梁為爭堰而戰　荷堅草木皆兵</p>
<p>晉宋齊北魏以來，割據紛更，莫不以泰州為重鎮。宋真西山氏曰：「淮東要青在清河口，淮西要害在渦·穎口。」穎口即為正陽關。古代沒有隴海路，沒有汽車，師旅可賴陸步，漕運則依三口，故軍事形勢　全在淮的得失。魏晉用兵與江東爭雄長，先事壽春，以控肥口，而蔽正陽。分爭之世，淮南北輒清野數百里，而正陽則舟軍輻輳，據為要津。延昌三年，梁造浮山衆，水遂下侵灌害淮泗，崔亮攻梁師於硤石（肥口）四年二月，蕭實賣大破梁淮北軍，九月淮堰決，梁人十餘萬口皆漂人海，為了一個堤堰，就動一場干戈。為水而戰，這是一個最明顯的例子。其時此地屬梁豫州。劉牢之破其將梁成斬之，劉元復以八千人敗苻堅，肥水一戰，草大皆兵。為歷史上一著名戰役。其後劉元出屯徐州，經略中州，為順東流之勢，奄有江右的一例。至於明末，則有流寇西來，據正陽關以為老巢，對地利不可謂無識略，旋攻泰州，方震孺率軍民守之，半月不下，流寇乃東竄定遠，終至轟渴。局世宗督趙匡胤師攻壽州三年不下，南唐劉仁瞻堅壁自守，恃水而固，且逆戰於正陽，大破周軍，周軍乃練水軍以取之，據滌，和，光舒以至楊州，引其糧貨，然壽州不下，諸州終不能固，及顯德間，克佔壽州，於是風　淮泗。金兀渡淮以據正陽壽春，長江空虛，舉國震動。岳飛率師東下，淮將畏怯，惟韓世忠擊破金人於壽州正陽，兀术乃取道穎口，引兵北遁，長江稍安，宋室乃得重整其武備。穎口的重要性，由此可見。</p>
<p>主席北伐督師　敵寇三度過關</p>
<p>蔣主席會於北伐時督師正陽關，軍出淮上，會隴海，以取徐州。正陽關在民國十七年，就有取名「中正」的一條街。廿年大水時，正陽關水勢較今年還要高數尺，而這條街地勢特高，成為惟一不被水浸的地方。</p>
<p>抗戰以後，廿七年四月敵陷蚌埠五月失徐州，敵復自徐州濟寗會師歸　後趨開封，再與自黃河南渡之敵曾攻開封。開封於六月五日陷落，皖境之敵此時已叩正陽關，有溯淮以取平漢之勢，黃河堤決，中原泛濫，敵人整個自年漢綫以取武漢的計劃受挫。敵人佔正陽關僅三天即退出，囘師陷壽縣。這場大水確實把敵人的攻勢遲緩了三個月。九月間敵以汽艇溯淮西上，經正陽關面至潢川，登陸後陷巍山面入信陽，再循平漢路南犯。陸道則亦取道正陽關，運陷固始·商城·麻城，而會攻漢口。敵人裏糧彈，實施大迂迴武漢，逕過正陽關，全師西竄，而不佔領所經每一據點。「土匪」遂乘機向居民勒索，否則便要鎮上開槍，以為恫嚇，因為一開槍敵軍可能上陸，正陽關將遭殺，竹橫敲足之後，居民還要弄船把他們送老。回想往事，居民們無不悚然而頭痛。三十三年，中原戰起，這是大失面子的一戰，敵軍又經正陽關，步騎溯穎水而上，陷穎上，原擬長騙而入黃注區以南，却遭我勁旅的迎頭通擊，可以說是歷來通淮西上時的第一次遭受外來嚴重的打擊。於是擁屍潰退，折返壽縣釁埠，而忽然不見的原駐軍復開入正陽關，大築工事，築這些工事的軍官還自立石碑，紀功說是依靠這此工事才打跑了敵人，老百姓說：「他把日子弄倒了。」</p>
<p>鉤沈正陽傳奇撰史必將轟動</p>
<p>敵騎四冀，而正陽關無悉，因為正陽關已成走私的孔　，那些大人物的公司行荘多至數士豪，人口自三萬躍至十萬人，原來第九職業中學的機械工場變成了安徽省企業公司的倉庫。日本人雖然不到，朝鮮人刦堂面皇之的到這裏做生意。正陽關對岸的沫河口是另外一個吞吐口，也是另外一個集團，雙方還有許多爭執，倒是些上海生意人出來講了一句閒話，談妥斤頭，才比較緩和一點。他們提起往事，還歷歷如繪，如怎樣武裝做生意之類，彷佛這與過去的光榮不可分離，比談今日的水災要有與味得多。所謂物賣交換，以桐油換口紅啤酒之類，那些公司還包運眷屬。說得好聽點，可是這些公司行荘之類的工作從未被檢查過，最牴限度是他們並沒有戰報和戰績發表，不像車事上有顯著的得失，所以遂所為一筆糊塗賬。可是正陽關的老百姓最為清楚。睜着眼睛看夠了。一聲戒嚴，在統一檢查下貨物進出如潮，貨物稅局之於今日，實如隔世，不免滄桑，可是有稅無稅，總還要有槍桿的力量，然後可以作「經濟戰」，否則使戰不成，非一敗塗地不可。老百姓說說他們都發了財—勝利了。</p>
<p>正陽關為一吞口，而界首則為一轉運站，穎水以上，一路繁榮，勝利以後，與沫河口等處的繁榮急遽消失，正陽關復自十萬人降至三萬，彷佛是一場夢。至今令人奇怪，三十三年中原局勢一緊，那些倉庫舖號都要貼上自壽縣拿來的日軍部符號，以資保障，這就是正陽關的經濟戰特色嗎？這是產生過傳奇時代的地方，雖然別種傳奇正在別的地方創造着，而正陽關的光榮已不可磨滅，抗戰以來，從沒有一個記者從大後方趕到這裏來觀察過，抗戰後我還算第一人，但我惋惜來得已經過遲，許多傳奇已經失去了新鮮意義。如吳有人寫一本客觀的正陽關近八年史，暴露出許多嘴臉，一定可以轟動。</p>
<p>隴海四綫中斷重尋走私孔道</p>
<p>勝利以後，那七萬人復員之速，却是十分可以佩服，幾個月內走得精光。剩下本地的老百姓，現今在水的包圍中發呆。那些小商輸確實獲得了一點好處，最近數月來，嫌得懶得去開航了，非要費夠了票，裝足了貨，錢是嫌定了，沒有辦法，才向上或向下開一趟，買了票等四五天不稀奇，一切在他們手裏，鄉巴佬在他們的氣焰下只好發抖。因為載重過量，連人帶貨，沈沒在濁流中的事也發生了。龔斷交通，莫此為甚。安徽省公路局無路行事，也辦輸運，也無殊於做生意。淮南路的正蚌聯運，不管有客無客，總是每日開航，頗便於客商，却以「龔斷」罪被攻訐着，因為商客有了選擇的對象。</p>
<p>隴海路一斷，自中原至蘇皖的第一批第二批客人，已取道漯河界首而外達這裏，漯界間可坐汽車，一日到達，界正間則為水道到平漢路需時伏，這條原是昔日走私孔道，不料勝利一年後仍有用處，但究竟是一條險途。如果隴海繼績不通，這一段交通綫還是可以略振繁榮的面目，但都不是駐足，而是過道。</p>
<p>哀子伏乳母屍瘟神反穿皮袍</p>
<p>在正陽關街道上走，這孤島上並不全是乾土，處處有成窋的積水，架上一條木板，走在上面，須要有一點本領才行。我會看見一羣穿着孝衣的人，走在路上，前面有一個人向居家發謝帖，接着是一個穿孝衣的就在門口跪下叩頭。這人家剛辦完喪事，現在來向各位弔喪者登門回謝。就是在災民所居的棚屋裏，也到處可見穿孝衣的人，從頭至脚都白。沖來一片洪水，也帶來了疫癘。據一家私人醫院的統計，二十多天來已死五百多人，都是霍亂，平均每天死二十人，最高紀錄每天死六十多人！罹疾治愈的有一千多。總之，是可怕的數字。只有棺材店生意好，居民又不相信打防疫針，而當時疫苗也缺乏，行政機構管不管？不管。只辦公文。前兩天才從壽縣發來幾瓶疫苗。（還有，救濟分署有三千袋麵粉發給壽縣，正陽關人說：我們一撮也沒有看到。）</p>
<p>疫苗來了，人已死得夠了。其實單是疫苗也救不得人民，還須要宣傳說服，有組織，所謂行政，但都談不到。徐執紳醫師對我說，他會說得舌敝唇焦，告訴居民打防疫針的重要，如果收費，就會被疑心為兒攬生意。他並非博士，然而是錢上被信賴的醫生，他所設立的壽民醫院，遂變成時疫醫院，如果論時價，注三千西西監水要十萬元，決非貧民可以負担（一具棺材也不過四五萬元）他的自製監水，在這裏灌活了不少人，被鎮民們交口讀譽。</p>
<p>居民罹疾，自然不盡上醫院去，他們也自有治療的方法。在晚上可以聽到大放鞭砲的聲音，有一個人自一家居戶出來，反穿皮袍，臉上塗得像大花臉，鞭砲就在他後面放，並且在這位先生走過的地方，用掃帚揮掃。這位先生就是一「瘟神」，經過這番手績已後，算是把瘟神送走了。這就是標淮治法之一。</p>
<p>有一家人整天不開門，裏面原住着母子兩個，隣舍破門而入，發現那女人已染沒而死，她的兒子還伏在胸上吸乳。—真是令人憟憟懼的地方！</p>
<p>皖北已臨饑境　刀兵不能重見</p>
<p>正陽關州雖以水為害，形勢上亦恃水而固。皖北全區，災情實極嚴重。記者居正陽關島上數日，屢聞匪刦附近水浸村落。黃水退後，所浸各區，淤泥積數尺。這途梗阻，行人裹足。宛如塞北冰河初化，偶或涉足，即有沒頂之虞。居民用長木板作撬，踏　行泥上。這是黃河淤泥的特色。所以如有爭戰，此區尚不適於馳驅。目前尚可引渒水而運六安豐收這榖，米價每二百五十斤五萬元，較稱低平。但比之一般民衆的收入，則並不低於京滬，不能信幾境可免。</p>
<p>最嚴重的問題是匪徒出沒，據聞泰縣以東有趙關餘，趙仇所率武裝約七八百人，自稱共軍，如饑民附之，共軍用之，則勢將成為正面對抗政府之武力。他處散部武裝，名目不辨，旅行皖北的人都苦極，而且還有「冒充」的軍隊。</p>
<p>豫鄂邊境衝突起後，共軍李先念部曾入皖北與皖東，一路係循豫南這灌河經三河尖渡穎水，取道渦，蒙間至徐州外圍　；加一路則經霍山東麓毛坦廠以及合肥以西官亭，然後越淮南路至明光附近去蘇北。其目的在集結主力，避免分散，軍事調動甚忙，流散者頗多。據三河尖來人所談：彼等於本月初經過，向地方需索糧食，菜蔬，不稍停留，即向北行。</p>
<p>國軍屯衛要點，若困糧而居。正陽重鎮，素於爭戰為要衡，系武事之區，非兵備之地，北伐以後，十年爭戰，二十年春，彭德懷徐向前部曾自豫鄂皖邊北上佔正陽關，為時僅三日，徐庭瑤部自蚌埠溯淮河擊之，共軍煌攻金家寨而取之，共軍始全部退出皖省，</p>
<p>今日的皖北災民遍野，洪水的災禍已足夠了，實在再不能重掃刀兵擾攘之區！</p>

<p>一顆倖存的肉彈</p>
<p>首先，我來自我介紹一下。我是蘇北通海交界長來鎮人，於上月在「解放區」，奉拉赴三廠衝鋒，二三百個前驅，手持竹竿，高紥柴草，升火叫殺，後面還隨帶百餘個武裝衛隊，總算威風十足，殺聲連天，盡了民主的最大責任，所幸廠內國軍，並不理睬，故全部肉彈，幸逃出尚早，獻奉妻妹，也在所不計。到現在各地封鎖，欲逃無路！其封鎖目的，無非要我們繼績表演民主精神，請問中共先生，我這次逃出使得使不得？可以不可以？</p>
<p>我已做過肉彈，幸未開發。逃不出來的肉彈，將無可數計。如此民主，實在有點可怕！（施廷榮）</p>
<p>殺人不見血的漢奸</p>
<p>編者先生：我是一個銅錫字號裏的小職員，在敵偽時代，我們同業以及五金字號中有着不少的奸商，和敵寇軍部及三并，三菱等洋行勾結，以水銀，銅，錫，五金等並熔毀銅錁市大量資敵，做着禍國殃民殺人不見血的勾當，賺了不少的造孽錢。</p>
<p>勝利以後，許多政治漢奸，因為最易受人注意而教身入囹圄，或自食其果以身試法了，可是這許多以軍用品資敵的經濟漢奸，（十足漢奸）他們有的是錢，所以他們依舊法外逍遙，有的做着海上寓公，有的囤積貨物投機取巧，有的專做外國貨的偷稅工作，他們的過去是被人忽略了，可是他們的罪行，却比政治漢奸有過之無不及，所以我希望實明的當局，最好把以前各銅錫號的賬冊吊查一下，（請注意他們有假冊子的）或將敵寇洋行及正金銀行的進出冊一查，我想必定能夠查出一個究竟來的。</p>
<p>銅錫業大約分做兩大幫：南京幫，紹興幫，畏罪潛逃的有之，但是仍舊做着海上寓公，且最近正在大肆活動的做着投機事業的也有。我們希望當局，立刻派員密查，以明是非，而警奸究。（葉立青）</p>
<p>懲奸荘嚴轉成弊政</p>
<p>編輯先生：政府正式懲治真正漢奸，乃商民所樂聞，現在收復地區，無論城市鄉鎮，率以檢舉漢奸為牟利及報後之機會！雖國法無私，但一場漢奸嫌疑官司，等到宣告無罪開釋，定已家破人亡！昔日無錢遠逃之陷區商民，皆有被檢舉可能，人心因之惶惑，未知政府當局，亦曾顧念陷區無辜人民（共產黨在外）而立有體恤辦法否？（讀者項栢雲啓）</p>

<h3>英國紡織工業之復興</h3>
<p>— Wilter　Hill原著鄧紹裘節譯</p>
<p>根據數量之標準，棉花確爲世界最重要之紡織原料，蓋棉織品之用途旣廣而又繁也。若以其他標準論，則棉花仍當佔優先，亦非其他任何天然或人造纖維所能及。故英國及其屬地爲世界棉花與棉織品出產最多之國家，而紡織工業之盛技，對於整個的英國前途實有密切之關係也。</p>
<p>此次第二次世界大戰之前，紡織工業在英國出口貿易方面，當然佔有最重要之地位。一九三六年英國紡織品之出口總値，共計五百萬英磅之鉅，一九三七年又遠增至六千八百五十萬英磅。由此可知英國朝野均重視紡織工業之復興。</p>
<p>人力與技術</p>
<p>但戰後英國紡織工業頗感復興成重問題者，乃目前或短時期之困難：生產量之不足。蓋大部份之工人被戰爭徵任作戰，或調派入軍需工業服務後，戰前原有五十萬工人之多，而現减縮至尙不足半數。因之生產量，不但無法增加紡織品之出口數量，現且不敷供應英國是民衆所需衣着之用。換言之，即現今英國在戰後復興紡織工業之第一步，即爲如何增加紡織工人。但其困難有二：（Ａ）軍需工業之工資高於紡織之工資，因之以前被調派入軍需工業之工人不願重返紡織工業工作。（Ｂ）紡織工人入軍需工業服務後，慣於飛機及其他現代工業之舒適環境，與優厚的待遇，亦恐無意再操舊業耳。</p>
<p>然此困難解決殊易。而最爲今日英國紡織工業界辣手者，則爲技術問題，此次戰後去年十月，及本年四月，五月英國之紡織工業勞資代表團曾先後三次赴美考察美國之紡織工業現况，而發覺本國紡織工業之製造方法及設備百不如人。因之其乃對此實異當重視，蓋於此次大戰期間英國紡織工業已屢遭美中等內外市塲傾銷而將其國際貿易數量减退。設長此下去，則其前途乃不堪設想矣。故英國紡織工業界鉅子乃集體請求政府襄助，商討如何挽救的破產的英國紡織工業。自今年一月至六月來，經過他們的一番努力，英國的舫織工業已又走上了欣欣向榮蓬勃之路了。</p>
<p>勞資合作</p>
<p>他們第一個商得的對策即如何增加大數量之紡織工人，英國的紡織工業勞資雙方即選派代表組織委員會，而硏究提高工資與改善環境保護機器以吸引工人，故自本年二月來，工人已增至四十餘萬，因之生產的數量也日在增加着，但是還遠及不上戰前，而和他們的戰後計劃理想獨佔整個世界的紡織市塲當然更遠更遠了。</p>
<p>接着他們硏討得了第二個的對策，勞資雙方建議了下列數點（甲）穩定生產，（乙）分班工作，（丙）勞資合作，（丁）合併紡織，以及裝修廠房，而最重要的爲迎合大量生產之經濟原則，自紡織之技術，欲求澈底之改革，合併工作步驟，集中生產能力，以及務求能配合標準長期生產，此外就是勞工與管理雙方必須密切合作，以求提高工作效率。</p>
<p>在其他方面，英國的紡織工業爲求出產精益求精起見，計劃着逐步必須採用現代化之機器，以及實行日夜兩班工作制度，以便充分利用新穎設備，而且英國的紡織工業界在本年的四月聯合成立了一個紡織物出品的硏究所，羅聘了美國英國的有數的著名的紡織專家，日以繼夜，夜以繼日的不斷的研究着出品的改善，經過他們二個多月的硏究，英國的紡織物現在已有了以下的成績。</p>
<p>研究工作</p>
<p>研究人員利用了新式的工具，着手檢討出紡織纖維之分子佈置情形，以改進其纖維性質，而日前英國的紡織工業界已可使紡織品不縮不蛀不透水，使其表面光滑如細葛布或人造絲，又能使其色澤潔白，且經一次手續，即可染出兩種調和之顏色，上述數種製造方式，英國各紡織工廠業已普遍採用，例如不縮手續，已被採用於棉毛針織衣着，而又據傳此次新發明，已爲英國人節省數百萬英磅之費用矣。</p>
<p>又根據英國紡織界發言人之意見，日後英國將有一新紡織品出現，旣非棉織物，又非羊毛呢，更非毛絲布，而爲介乎三者之間的一種紡織品，英國最近又出產一種棉織的被單，羊毛的襯衫，旣溫暖，又舒服，亦華麗，驟視之如蔴布無異，而最近二月來英國的紡織出品，已有一種奇特的光彩，燦爛奪目，宛如綢緞一般，實屬難能可貴。</p>
<p>但是英國的紡織工業界還不知足。最近數月來，英國各處紡織工業的代表更在作進一步的討論着研究的工作，將來的計劃大綱。而英國的紡織品將採一標準標記，以示各種紡織品之不同來源及品質而更爲棉花羊毛各種紡織原科不虞匱乏起見，英國政府對於澳大利亞，新西蘭，以及南非洲所產之棉花羊毛稅率，已由每捆六便士提高至每捆二先令，所以在這一種的情形，英國的紡織工業新動態，對於前途之發展是當有莫大之裨益也。</p>
<h3>中國農產運銷</h3>
<p>— 鍾德祺譯</p>
<p>「生產」與「分配」為經濟學兩大問題，在農業方面尤為重要，本文作者寇替斯（W.　M.　Curtiss）為美國著名農業經濟學者，曾於民國廿六年來華，執敎金陵大學農業未經濟系，此文對今後「農產運銷」在中國的重要時別强調，故雖爲慶祝金大農業經濟系廿五週年而寫，亦可作研究中國農業經濟問題者之參攷，譯者附誌。八，二。</p>
<p>金陵大學農業經濟系在過去二十五年中，在農塲管理，物價，及土地經濟方面，已經有了很顯著的進展，我預祝將來，它將以更大的注意力，表現在農業產運銷上面。</p>
<p>在美國的農業敎育和農業硏究史上，已經表示出在生產方面已用過了很大的功夫，這是應該如此的，近年來，更多的注意都算中在分配（Distribution）（譯者按：包括分配中各過程）上面，在美國，當消費者在市塲購買農產品時，他付出的錢，一半是歸之於產品的生產者，而一半則消耗在分配過程中。一個國家，她愈走向工業化，則分配食用產品工作就愈加重要。</p>
<p>在一個農業原始化的國家，她的田塲大都是自給自足式（SeIf　Sufficient　Type），分配問題比較不重要，但如果一個國家要靠她百分之二十的人口生產來供給全國：則分配問題就特別重要，而生產者及消費者的利益都同樣的感到威脅。</p>
<p>一個國家愈加都市化，工業化時，結果使農村人口更加的受到全配制成（DistributionSystem）的控制，當一國的經濟狀況發生升降時，則農民收入隨之而升降的程度極大，因爲分配費用是在生產及消費者之間，而且比較固定，因此，當一個狂跌到來的時候，農民在消費者手中所得的一部份錢，可能從百分之六十的平均往下降，而結果使農民整個的破產。</p>
<p>研究運銷的目標，應該是同時增加生產者及消費者的利益，而這種目的的達到，並不是在使生產者在生產費用上多取消費者的錢，而是更好的在於增進分配效率而使雙方都有利。這種目標，應該是减少生產時的人力消耗和成本，使分配和消費都可多得好處。</p>
<p>當中國變成更高度的工業化，農業生產變爲國家經濟的一小部份時，農產運銷必將更形重要；因此，農產運銷的研究，必爲一個進步的經濟系的工作中的最重要的工作。</p>
<h3>益之　曳引機</h3>
<p>— 譯自紐約時報週刋</p>
<p>汽油曳引機雖不是最重要的農業機械發明，却可能是最富於戲劇意味的。由於它巨大的力量，已經仗收獲復合機的效力大爲增加。當世界第一次大戰的時候，曳引機使大平原一變而爲意料以外的大殼倉，一畝小麥所需要的耕作時間，由於使用曳引機而大爲减少，同時則每塊田地的面積也因此而得此擴展。第一次大戰後，許多退伍士兵發現農田上已經無需他們參加耕作，因此被迫參加了一九二一年的失業行列。</p>
<p>小麥機械化耕作法在第一次大戰後繼續向前發展，一九二六年到一九三〇年製造成功的複合機共有十一萬五千架，而前五年的複合機生產量却不過祗有二萬五千架，到一九三八年肯薩斯州百分之九十的小麥，都是用複合機收獲的。</p>
<p>二次大戰的前十年中，美國農村中的曳引機差不多增加了一倍，一九四〇年時，美國所用的曳引機差不多有一百六十萬架左右。那正是大不景氣的年頭，購買一架曳引機差不多是普通一個農夫一生之中最重大的舉動，所以促成農業機械化的確有一些力量，因爲，如果農夫的經濟能力尙不足以用分期付款的方法購置一架曳引機時，他可以將他的田地抵押出去而購置一架曳引機。現在美國農田上一共有二百萬架曳引機，這些曳引機對於土地所有種的合併有着巨大的影響，因爲，以機械發動的設備適宜於用在大規模的農田上，一方面機械設備可以做較多的工作，一方面較多的投資也希望能換得較大的利潤。以往一個農夫能做的工作不多，現在則每一農人可以做四倍以上的工作了。有許多地主所有的土地都是分散的，幾塊田地可能相距幾英里之遠，但今日農家已能使用橡皮輪的曳引車，所以距離的因素也已經不如昔時的重要。</p>
<h3>工商管理槪論</h3>

<p>丁　工作的督促</p>
<p>在製造工作的進行之中，是需要隨時的督促的。這督促的工作，可以分爲兩種：</p>
<p>Ａ　工作進行時的督促</p>
<p>Ｂ　貨品製成過程中的檢查</p>
<p>關於第一種工作，是很容易明白的譬如我們建造一所房屋，我們一定要請一個監工，請他去監視工作的進行，他的責任去免除工人的偸懶，和營造廠的偸工减料。</p>
<p>關於這一方面，可以有兩種方法：</p>
<p>第一種方法，是用我們的眼睛去做監視的工作，在製造廠裏的工頭就是負這種工作的人，他要看工人在工作時間之內，是否偸懶，或是否工作得不合標準，如果發現，立即糾正，使不要繼續錯誤下去。</p>
<p>第二種方法，是用記錄的方法，譬如說要考勤，每一個工人，有一張卡片，在上工的時候，就在計時鐘上去打一個時間，下工的時候也是如此，又如每天，所生產的工作，都有記錄，這一個方法，不但可以使一部的主任看到工人的成績，經過統計的工作，可以使一個公司的當局也可以看到廠務的進行狀態，譬如我們辦理一個農塲，有着幾萬頭牛，那末每一頭牛，有一個號碼，每天出牛奶多少，可以有一個統計，一個牛奶公司的主人，正可以不入牛塲而知道牛的一切——牠們的產量，牠們的健康，她們的消耗。</p>
<p>做一個公司的當局，事實上不允許他一夭到晚到各處去視察所以記錄和統計的方法，是最能够供應他的需要的。</p>
<p>通常上述兩種工作是同時並進的。</p>
<p>關於貨品的檢査，那末對於貨品前途的影響很大，非要認眞辦理不可，我曾參觀過奇異安迪生燈泡廠，他們製成每一個步驟都要經過檢査，在包裝妥善出廠之前，還要抽出幾隻，加以檢査，有看是不是合乎標準，又如華廠，藥品出廠之前，也要經過許多次的檢査。尤其是製造注射用的藥物，有許多十藥廠，爲求愼重並劃淸負責起見，凡是負責檢査的人，在附在藥盒中的一張紙條上，都要簽名蓋章。</p>
<p>再以編書出版而論，做校對工作，也等於是一種檢査工作——檢査有沒有錯誤，商務。世界等書局，曾有一時把校對人的姓名也附載在版權頁上，滬個舉動，也就是表示愼秉的意思。</p>

<h3>音樂與夢幻</h3>
<p>— 孫煜</p>
<p>在一册散文集子裘，有一篇談及晉樂的文章，作者說：「音樂用不到像繪畫文字那樣描繪刻劃，但是圖畫所不能描繪的，言語所不能傳達的，音樂却能曲盡其　。音樂所給予人的是心靈上所能感受的美的最高境界，因爲音樂之美是異常抽象的，它的發揮也愈可廣大深入，沒有限制。欣賞晉樂而從所引起之聯想意象上定評，那是一種錯誤。」音樂之美是異常抽象的，我想假如說它是接近夢幻的，那是再也確當不過的了。音樂藝術常常與夢幻有着很深的關係；法國的著名交響曲家貝里奧（一八〇三－一八六九）所作的幻想曲就是究全描寫夢幻的情景。據說常時貝里奧失戀，墜入很深的苦悶之中，在那支幻想曲裏，他描寫在他的夢幻中把他的愛人殺死了，而且看見了很多的炫麗的景色，以及魔女的舞蹈。</p>
<p>「欣賞音樂而從所引起之聯想意象上定評，那是一種錯誤。」我覺得這句話是對的，因爲音樂的游離物象是較之繪畫那些藝術爲甚，音樂可決不能去把握一件明確的意象，你說他這一節音樂是描寫晚霞沉落，可是要想做月落西山或是失戀的悲哀又何嘗不可呢？這是因爲聲音能描寫氣氛，如興奮悲哀等等，而不能描寫事物。（卽明確的意象。）同一關於音樂的文字裏又說：「欣賞一種高級音樂的時候，我祇覺得陶醉沒沉在這裏面，遣世忘我地，被音樂之神所引導而入於無限的至高至美的境界。」我覺得音樂就祇是純粹的音樂，沒有別的。其實陶醉浸沉於着樂如陶醉於夢境一樣，而這至高至美的境界也是喜悅與悲哀。這種感覺，也許只是穿鑿附會吧。</p>
<h3>嘉陵江上</h3>
<p>— 刃鋒刻</p>
<h3>低徊</h3>
<p>— 汗羊</p>
<p>看過錢塘江潮的人，都知道那是如何地澎湃汹湧，聲勢動人。但我總覺得還是不如細碎的海潮打在石岸上發出了細碎而曲折的響聲的好。</p>
<p>有年，我在山東沿海的一個小都市裏過了一陣日于。我的住室的後面，便是海，一望無際的藍色的海。打開後窗，可以讓腥氣的海風盡量吹在我臉上，吹在案頭養着的瓶花上，吹在我的整個心上。那與其說是愉快，不如說沉醉；的確，那鹹味的海風，旣不猛烈，又含着股子勁兒，確資是具有感情的東西。每次站立在窗口時，我便想到這並不是我在領受着海風的恩惠，却是它在呑沒我了。那眞是像酒一樣地侵入在我的血液裏。</p>
<p>但還有比海風更令我沉醉的，是每個份晚和侵晨的潮聲。海是太大了，漲起潮來，並沒有什麼特殊的聲勢，宛如一個涵蓄深厚的智憑的人，即使感情上昇也還是不動移色，護我們莫測其究竟。唯一的消息，報告着潮來了的，便是踏着緩緩的拍于，悠然地撞擊在石岸上的細碎的繁晉。那聲音像是低低的訴語，像是反復地叮嚀，像詩人吟味他高速的想像，像愛人用了柔情的語句敲叩着對方的心扉，像……。不，我沒有適當的文字來比擬它，只覺得它是那麽情思縷縷，低徊無限。它使我悽黯，使我無眼，使我從睡中警覺，使我製造出更多的美麗，奇幻，驚險，不着邊際的夢。</p>
<p>從此，我學會了生活，學會了如何安置自己的感情。</p>
<p>人性之對於生活，正如靈魂之主宰着一個人是相高的吧。沒有靈魂的人，不懂得用人性滋養。自已的心的人，即使物質的條件異常豐富，究竟他還是不會生活。</p>
<p>於是，所謂生活，其意義就在於造成了人問味的氣氛然後再領受其給予我們的酸甜苦辣各種滋味這一點吧。吾則活着就是活着，我們又有什麼理由要求更好的境地？所以，眞正的生活是應該從內心出發的，應該是由內向外然後再收歸於內的。必須從這些地方，才有眞的人性的顯示·</p>
<p>雖然有時候我也愛好着一種熾烈而爽直的感情，譬如說心裘難過就放開聲大哭一陣子，高興了就盡量地歌唱或跳叫，那實在對於我們的生命有着解放的功效但人類的體力是有限的一度用的太多，和拉長了時間緩緩地用它，結果在我們生命的耗費量上是相等的，所不同的則是對於生活的功效之差別了。在我們的「人生相」上，尤其在近代，生活的苦悶，也就是人問的苦悶，是每一個問過自己的心靈的人所一致首肯的，因之，我便要說，至少是在目前這個時代的叚階裏，眞正的「主讓者」是不曾存在的。因爲浪漫在人生塲面上的種種尙缺少足以罷我們產生眞的「樂觀主者」廢的條件。如今社會固有些自命爲「樂觀主表者」的人們，在不顧一切地享樂着，讓音樂，酒，霓虹燈來玩弄着他們的官能。實際他們並不了解樂觀，只是像廚川白村氏所說的在對生活嘲笑而已。他們不拿出「眞心」來應對生活，反抱了一種戲弄的態度，那的確是「虛無主義」者的另一表現。哀莫大於心死，我總覺得那些把生活和自已的心擱置在一段很遠的距離上的人們、竟至於迎「懷疑」的能力也失去了的人們，更有着一些無可摸索的悲哀。此外又有一種人，是含了一肚子眼淚在反常地用享樂麻醉着自已的，新近我就結識了這樣一個友人，她更大胆地嘲弄着生活，嘲弄着周圍的人們和自已，但我却察覺了她的時時激動起來的感情，往往會不知所以然地哭了出來。這自然是富有「人間味」了，自然是「人性」的了，但不知怎的，還是覺得那究竟不是一種正常的人生。凡是不正常的人生，都是畸形的，都是偏激的，都是可哀的。一陣在歡，神經過度地緊張之後，再帶來的是什麽東西，不難想像。所以我是毋寗更愛好更講美着一種較高較大的智慧，一種足以領導感情走在正常的人性上的不可測度的雋智。</p>
<p>海是太大了，所以潮並不顯明；錢塘江口在河流之中是大的，但它和海比起來，不知道要小多少倍，所以在海裏像若無其事的潮，一入了錢塘江口，便洶湧起來，激動起來。潮是感情，也是「人性」，海並不拒絕它，只是能够把它融和到「若無其事」的程度，才是海的眞正的偉大。</p>
<p>有感情而缺少雋智的人，往往流於　淺粗俗；有理智而缺少感情的人，又往往流於機詐冷酷。爲了完成完美的生活能態度，爲了用「人間味」滋養自已的心，是必然要在情感之上再加以雋智而使之融和爲一的吧。「人性」的可愛，是要有情感又有　智的；「人性」的偉大，必須是具有了「雋智的情感」和「情感的雋智」這二者之後，才能眞切地顯示出來。、</p>
<p>感情的韻味，是要從「低徊」之中才能嘗到的。號咷大哭，總不如低聲飲泣那樣地令人悽然；縱聲狂笑，絕不及會心微笑那樣地更能動人，這正如錢塘江裏澎湃洶湧的狂潮，不如海邊敲擊着石岸的碎聲是一樣的道理。把感情藏在心底的深處，不去浪費它，消耗它，到了適當的時候，才珍惜地取出一些，僅僅是其中的一部使其披了雋智的外衣出現，那無識如何是「人生」塲上最可愛的境界吧。所謂「幽默」所誚「人性」，應該是指此而言。人是不需要任何「滿足」的，人所需求的只是一種「低徊」，一種低徊反復到無限的韻味。正如我們決不願把一件任何美味的食物一口呑下肚子去，却寗願把一小部分噙在口中反復地咀嚼。乏味固不好，味太濃太多或太滿足了，也就使人厭倦。所以中國人講究「品茶」而痛絕「牛飲」，生活是同樣的道理。感情是生活的美味，但囫圇呑棗的人或貪嘴吃一下，就要吃够的人，那無異在傷害着自已，剝奪了生活的意義，那是最不懂生活的了。</p>
<p>懂了這個，我們就應該明白文學和藝術等等的來源。廚川白村說文學的鑑賞立脚於「自己的發見」，就是說讀者爲了從作品中發見自己，才去鑑賞的，我是十二分地同意着這一見地的。「人生」的本質，實際也不過是生命的肖我的欣賞而已。足以令人產生「生命的自我欣賞」的，便是那些最富於『人性』的地方，也便是那些最令人低徊無限的地方，越是這樣，人才能越感到生命之眞實的存在，才有欣賞的餘裕。文藝·藝術·便是從這裏出發的吧。喜劇之不如悲劇更爲人所愛好，便是爲了感情發洩得太快，「滿足」是封閉了「低徊」之門而結束「人性」的流通的一幕，任何的故事，任何的形象，一達到「滿足」的一步，便算完了，沒什麼用處了，它再不會引起人家的興味。一對夫婦，如果是順利的結合，美滿地生活下去，便不會成爲動人的故事，也決不能成爲小說的題材，因爲這裏是缺少「人性」的流露，不能使別人發見「自已」的呵。可是如果他與她之間一旦發生婚變，人們立刻注意了，他們的生活立刻「故事化」了，這就是因爲他們至此才要發揮各自所有的最真實的『人性』，其中便也含有了別人的生命之故。</p>
<p>「人生的藝術」應該在這裏尋求才是。一個善於處理自已的生活的人，應該像一個小說家到處尋求動人的題材那樣地也去到處尋求足以使感情低徊的生活內容。生活的可愛，生活的享受，必然就在這裏，我是如此深信着的。</p>
<p>音樂上的旋律，詩歌上的顫蕩的調子，繪畫上的光的運用，不都是在「低徊」之中才顯出了藝術的能力的嗎？所以，我想說：藝術的本質就是一種「低徊」但「低徊」並不是藝術的獨立性，那完全是適應了人們生命的要求而然。</p>
<p>正常的人生，應該是合乎藝術的要求的，應該是低徊於生命的「自我的欣賞」。</p>
<p>這個道理，是海吿訴我的。藝術家們，我想他們一定都明白這個這理，不過沒有切實地指明罷了。</p>
<p>十九世紀的大文豪L·托爾斯泰，就有過這種體騐。他晚年住在耶斯摩耶的時候，爲了他的兒子要學小提琴，便請來一位靑年的音樂敎師，天天夜裏奏着貝多芬的名曲。想不到這位文豪竟是深深地被貝多芬的曲子感動了，每天傍晚他都是含着滿眶的淚在傾聽着那位靑年樂師的曲奏，有時候竟使他激動得坐立不安，打開窗于向外邊吁氣。結果，他便寫了一部「克列采長曲」的小說，那便是他在聽過了貝多芬的克列采長曲之後而對近代婚姻所下的攻擊。事情好像是奇怪的，托爾斯泰竟會從音樂的感動中想到了婚姻制度的虛僞。但如果明白我在前邊所說的道理的話，郝便認爲是很自然的結果，毫不奇怪了。</p>
<p>「愛情」的本質，和藝術一樣，只是一種「低徊」，一種「生命的低徊」。男女兩性在戀愛的過程中，他們的內心是完全藝術化了的，他們不斷地從對方的愛的洗禮中，發見着自己，享受着「生命的自我欣賞」的喜悅。所以一個人唯有倚在愛人的胸前，才愈覺自已的生命之不凡與可貴，從愛人那裏接受了來的「愛」，是一而美的鏡子，它不但使你認識自已的溫情，柔腸，聴明和智慧，不但使你嬌痴得像個孩子，神經靈敏得像獵犬，心思細密得像鬼靈精，並且它更能使你察覺到自已平日萬不會察覺出來的隱藏在你心裏的一些潛伏的熱力和人性的眞實。所以『愛』是一件工作，一件藝術性的工作，當你愛上了一個人的時候，這工作便開始了，你是在做着「靈魂」的『發掘』。一方面你是在發掘着愛人的靈魂，但另一面你也因了你的靈魂的被愛人發掘着而愈益認識了自已，這其間便有着無限一低徊』的。所以我常常說：「愛是一種藝術」。愛人們用了高度的雋智和高度的熟情融合成一股『愛』的力址去發　對方的靈魂，那就和音樂用了旋律，詩用了顫蕩，繪畫川了光，綫，來發掘人們的靈魂是完全相同的。並且我們接受了對方的『愛』，其意義也正如我們從音樂，詩，繪畫，小說等等接受了來的一樣，唯一的喜悅便在於『自已的發見』，便在於「生命的自我欣賞」之上。所以『愛』是越純潔越好，必須排去了肉慾的要求和滿足，才能達到了藝術的境界。「愛」是愈曲折愈好，愈反復低徊至於無限愈好，理由便是如此。</p>
<p>但社會是不許人長久享受「愛」的幸福的，婚姻制度便是說愛人們經過了一段日子的低徊以後，便應該結束，於是乎他和她必須結婚。結婚是一種「滿足」，也正是那『發掘靈魂』的工作的中止，實際也便是一般所說的是「戀愛」的堵墓。一對愛人，如果一直保持着『愛』的形式，彼此的靈魂的發備是沒有完的，好像雙方都有無限的寳藏，時時引誘你去發掘而又掘取不盡，於是愛的低徊也就將無止期。可是他們結婚了，一結了婚，彼此都是「這是我的所有了，一切一切都在這裏，你快點拏去吧」。於是『愛』便被葬送了。愛人是靈魂的結合，夫妻是社會的結合，而我們現今的社會，是非殺死了「愛人」不能成爲「夫婦」的。這便是托爾斯泰所發見了的眞理：「近代的婚姻完全是處僞」!</p>
<p>貝多芬的「克列采長曲」，我還沒福氣聽，但總可以想像那是令人低徊無限的吧。我們需要着生命的低徊，需要的「靈魂」的被「發掘」，所以才愛好音樂，愛好一切藝術。但我們生命的淵密，有的地方是藝術也無力發掘的，只有倚在愛人的胸前才成，所以我們更在需求着兩性的愛。所以托爾斯泰由『克列采長曲』的『低徊』而感到「愛」的低徊之不可或缺，因之忿然於近代婚之萍送了「愛」的虛僞，這側路子不是很自然一的嗎？不是正在證明着我在上邊所說的「生活」的意義嗎？</p>
<h3>世故</h3>
<p>— 柯鳳</p>
<p>你有沒有這經騐？獨自溜路在冷寂的街頭，把疲乏的心情蒙路在向晚的迷茫裏；或者　負着一些無謂的忙迫，從喧囂的行人道上匆匆而過，忽爾，有一　睜大的眼凝在你的面前。睜一陣，於是一雙汗濕的手緊緊地黏在一起，是熱與熱的交流，神經震盪着，然而，被此之間却各各都是無言。</p>
<p>這不會是出於矯情的做作。你或會說：誰的感情都不似從前的易於激動，易於泛濫了。眞的，經過這幾多年的簸弄，就一些苦難和磨折，誰也不知該打從何處說起！</p>
<p>我的朋友和我，就如此地默默相對着，目光再度交接時，他笑了。我忽然覺得空虛起來，那嘴角的牽動，那眼睛的縫，一切和我都是熟悉的，可是那笑容裘再也找不出他「五月天的明朋。」我自然也笑着的，有澀然的味在舌尖，我的笑也是苦味的。</p>
<p>「你蒼老了！」</p>
<p>可是朋友有更巧妙的說法：「從你的臉上看來，你也世故深了。」</p>
<p>「世故深了！」這應該更是屬於「世故」的說法。我不禁戰慄。</p>
<p>把一些浮沉在人海裏偸偸學得的罪惡保存下來；把排擠，傾軋代替了人與人之問的相助與同情；把謊騙和欺詐來換取他人的　心；把良心塗抹成各種顏色，一份份地拿出來賣錢；領導着人家認白作黑，指黑爲自；把鬼魂裝在自已的軀殼裏以替代自己的靈魂。這些，這些難道是「世故」之深？</p>
<p>對上是奴顏卑膝，謙恭迎逢，對下是作威作福，氣槪傲慢；將乞情，取媚，奉承，拍馬，僞善的仁慈，自私的慷慨，或和厲，狠和毒的臉譜勾劃一套下來，以備隨時取用；又唸熟了整套台詞，將人世比擬作舞台，苦心孤詣地訓練自已，要使自已成爲比舞台上的名傳更其出色的角色。這也是屬於「世故」？</p>
<p>比較可憐一點的是職戰競兢於人吃人的場面，跟着人家尾巴的影子，說黑說白；旣不敢高聲大笑，又不能放聲痛哭，歡樂是沒有份的，怨毒的聲息也不敢吐出半口，將靈魂關閉在緊密的鐵報子裏，任它麻痺，任它死去；更是天天整憂着看人家的臉色，人家的臉色使是他自身的「人格」的立脚點。這裏，這裏也有「世故」？</p>
<p>「你的臉上，世故灤了。」</p>
<p>將也如老槍之滿面烟容而無可掩飾？</p>
<p>人世的浮沉，初以爲學了乘而沾沾自喜的人，你祇是沾了一身病毒，染上一身罪惡！</p>
<p>「你的臉上看來，你也世故深了。」我看朋友，他。他也蒼老。</p>
<p>在那些「世故」之下，靑春被消磨，靈魂被暗蝕。握緊着朋友的手，神經在震盪着，我覺得我們在戰慄。</p>
<p>我們祇有苦笑。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風34</p>
<p>平：我因國事日亟、委負長乃召集全國賢達，赴盧山談話，討論應付時局方針。</p>
<p>辛：據南京我情報，知蔣政權野心勃勃，欲大舉與我對抗，現在盧山，積極召集軍事會議。作戰意念，甚為顯明，皇軍乎，購徵支那，此其時矣！以支那之稻草武人，欲與我炳烈皇軍對敵，何異以卵擊石？</p>
<p>平：我委員長於十六日密令宋哲元，作速解決日在津駐軍，並移駐保定，整軍備戰。</p>
<p>辛：派遣軍參謀總部密令，南京意欲唆使宋司令一致行動，今窺宋在津與我香月淸司軍部表示妥洽，故我乃作進一步要求，不達目的不止。</p>
<p>平；委員長對時局發于表重要文吿：（一）國民政府外交政策爲對內求自存，對外求共　　始終愛護和平；（二）蘆溝橋為北平門戶。蘆溝橋事件能吾結束，爲最後關頭的境界；（三）臨到最後關頭、只有堅決犧牲，但我只準備應戰、而非求戰；（四）和平未絕望前，總希望和平解決，但須固守四點最低限度的立塲；1任何解決，不得侵害中國生權及領土的完整；2冀察行政組織，不容任何不合法之改變；3中央政府所委地方官吏，如冀察委員長宋哲元等，不能任人要求撒換；4第二十九軍現在所駐地區，不能受任何約束。</p>
<p>辛：南京政權現已發動政治及宣傳攻勢，窺其用意，一欲實現恐嚇政策，一欲離開我與冀察行政間之關係。無論如何，我仍須一往無前，執行我內閣首腦之既定政策，宋哲元司令今日（七·一九）在平之對我親善行動，表示南京離問手段，只是庸人自優耳。……</p>
<p>從以上這幾條電訊對照看來，就知道當日，日我兩方對於時局的立塲：日方是堅定的要實行侵略主義，以便實現控制大東亞的美夢；我方雖說到了最後關頭，仍舊要求和平　　要不侵害我國主權及領土的完整。</p>
<p>這一天，我兩次用秘密方式、向長辛店打聽鶴兒消息，回音老是含糊，並且叫我速回本站。Ｗ君當然也十分關心鶴兒的行動，和「七封秘械」的消息。所以到了晚間，不再堅持挽留，讓我動身回站。</p>
<p>從北平到長辛店，僅僅只有二三十分鐘小火車的行程，要回長辛店，似乎容易設法。無奈這時，因爲日我屢次武裝衝突，火車早已不能行動自由。再者，我的行蹤，絕對不能讓日方特務機關知道，因爲長辛店電站，並未向日方任何機關公開過。可是我急於要回到本站，却是鐵一般的事實。</p>
<p>現在只有兩條路徑，聽我採取，一，步步探索前進，到一步，看一步，發生問題，隨機應付。二，到北平日方特務分站，看看機會，應用我同鶴兒議定的十五種應急方式之一或二，碰碰運氣。最後，我決定用第二條路徑；因第一條路未見得能够如願抵達目的地，而且比較危險。</p>
<p>到了北平，日特工分站，－這個空前的恐怖製造所－我利用參謀總部的某種名義，會見了當地的首腦。（所謂某種名義的工其，祗是一個總部證章，和口述的身份，－當然是製造的一種臨時身份。）這種雙方見面的情勢，好比前淸時代京官巡行，凌駕地方官的局面，地方官當時無法，也不敢探索京官的眞僞，只好跪迎跪送。</p>

<h3>攤販復活</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>本市馬路攤販，經市當局的認眞取締，自九月一日後已銷聲匿跡；但是問題就在於只是「銷聲匿跡」，並非澈底解決。（這里所謂解決是指解決這一件事情而言，並非要解決掉攤販們的飯碗。）</p>
<p>銷聲匿跡只是暫時的，因而便會「日久玩生」；數日來，一度失蹝的攤販都逐漸復活了。有的是化整為零，他們放棄了攤子，而用手提著著許多出售品（如玻璃皮包等），在大街上流動叫賣；有的是化零為整，他們集中到某些弄堂里去，聯合成一個小商場。</p>
<p>我們深知取締攤販的好處：比如市容的煥然一新，行人交通的漸見秩序化，碼頭偷祸風之將見消，以及更大的好處：使國貨更易找出路等等。但是更重要的事情，也是衆所周知的：攤販改業問題。正如拍蒼蠅的時候，必須同時注意如何處置垃圾一樣。</p>
<p>我們並不因為攤販改業困難而反對取締攤販；但我們認為當局既然雷萬風行於先，則必須努力貫澈於後；以目前攤販漸漸復活的情形觀，政府只是做到了第一步，如果任它下去，則半月內，全市攤販仍將恢復舊觀，殆無疑義。那麼，何必當初呢？</p>
<p>我們希望什麼事不做則已，既做了就不要虎頭蛇尾！攤販改業誠然不易，但僅是不易而已，卻非不可能！在任何情形下，政府不能讓九月一日的取締攤販幾成多此一舉！</p>
<h3>攤販搬家</h3>
<p>上海橫斷面二</p>

<p>教育問題</p>
<h3>作弊學生談作弊</h3>
<p>— 谷玉</p>
<p>我是一個學生，看到九月十日凌人君的「談考試作弊」，我感到難過，慚愧；因為我也正是作弊的一份子，而我的同學也差不多沒有一個不作弊。不過對凌人君所寫的，我不能十分滿意。</p>
<p>凌人君所以為學生們的作弊理由是半是半非，我未能茍同，因為許多都是寶際問題。</p>
<p>凌人君說：「請教育尃農家作注意這些啊！切勿以分數好的學生，程度就高了。」其實學校以及教育尃家何當沒有注意到這些呢？提出一次作弊，就要記大過，提出三次作弊，就要開隊，但這些決沒有用的，這太消極了，因為捉得愈緊，學年們的作弊按術也就愈高明！</p>
<p>而且現在的作弊太普遍了，我敢說學生十有九人是作弊的，難道學生都不好嗎，所以應請教育尃家們應該注意到現在的教育，才是積極的辦法；現在的學校，往往一班有七八十學生，先生混飯，校長賺錢，於是學生也胡鬧而不讀書，考試起來，有的教師有意難一下學生，讓他們考不出，有的教師怕學生成績不好自已坍台，讓他們作弊，因此，而養成了作弊的風氣，所以積極的應該注意師資，注意學生平時是否了解，以平常分數為成績，減少考試的嚴重，那末，學生也就自然而然減少作弊了</p>
<p>再說現在的助學金，都以分數為核準標準，清寒學生當然不一定功課就好，這一點我希望教育當局及學校當局注意，助學金核準決不能以分數為標準，那末，作弊的風氣當然又可以減少了</p>
<p>除這兩點外更應使學生有學問第一，分數無所謂的觀念；這樣倘使再有少數作弊的學生，就可以除去害羣之馬，因其他學生作弊而作弊的學生，當然也就不再會有了。</p>
<p>［编者按：目前作弊之風雖非無因，但這總不是值得鼓劲的事情：谷玉君這篇文章，可以作當局的參考，但不能作為作弊學生的理由！在任何情形下我們反對作弊，正如公務官員不能以「收入太少」作為舞弊的理由一樣！否則，凡是壤的事情，都變做可以原諒的了！）</p>
<h3>學習商人</h3>
<p>— 乘之譯自九月份讀者文摘</p>
<p>英皇需治五世向以篩儉聞世，同時他想培養他的子孫，使具此同樣的美德；可是，相反的威雨遜親王卻偏喜花費，當他邏在學校中讀書時，有一次他寫信給他父親，要求額外費用，孰料在間書中，他受到微尃訓斥，並囑其改變已往作風，多多學習商人，結果英皇在下一封來信中看到：「…我決定接受你勸告，已把你的來信買給收藏家，得款二十五鎊…」</p>
<h3>因吻離婚</h3>
<p>— 許盈譯自大陸報</p>
<p>荻斯女士對於男女間的疑難問題素有研究，早有權威之稱。下面是她闡明，「接吻之道」的近作。</p>
<p>最近發生了一件離婚案，丈夫聲稱他的妻子每次和他接吻時總是向他索取美金五元，這完全是勒索行為，於是根據此理由，這種妻子是要不得的。而妻子呢，她卻直認不諱，但說並不一定要五塊錢，隨便她丈夫有幾多給幾多都可以通融的。</p>
<p>至於是否丈夫以為夫妻之間的接吻是天公地道的權利，因此決不願意因妻子的要挾而付出不必要的黑市代價，仰或是否妻子嫌丈夫那種啄鳥式的接吻討厭而視為多餘，所以想出這樣辦法來略予限制呢，我們尙未獲悉其詳情。審理那案件的推事，也許會為這間題而大傷其腦筋，同時會感覺得奇怪，這樣事情居然會對夫妻生活發生如此嚴重的影響。</p>
<p>我們暫時不談和妻子接吻一次是否值得五塊錢的問題，我們目前所應注意的是結婚關係中感覺痛苦的一種原因。為了這，許多妻子會經流過不知多少眼淚。這就是為什么男人對於和妻子接吻的態度在婚前和婚後竟然會有這樣天壤之別。</p>
<p>為了這個緣故，無怪乎那些妻子們總懹疑為什麼丈夫總把和妻子接吻當做一種義務，並且為什么他們對妻子的接吻總是冰冷的。</p>
<p>夫妻間的接吻之所以冷冰冰的原因大約是為了日夕為之，故覺平淡無奇的緣故。普通的習慣規定了夫妻間每日應該接吻十數次這樣做法，我們似乎把接吻當做一種習慣，然而卻忽略了另外的一個真理：在最溫柔的一剎那，在愛情逹到最高潮的當兒所接的一吻比較千千萬萬次啄木鳥式的接吻要寶貴得多了！</p>
<p>凡事以稀為貴，所以那個向丈夫索取五塊錢才給他一吻的妻子到底比那些臨丈夫離開家襄的時候間他一聲：「喂！你這樣就走開了嗎？你還忘記了做一樣事情呢。」的女人更聰明得多了！</p>
<h3>珍視校譽　愛護學風</h3>
<p>— 見之</p>
<p>十一日午飯時，自治會主席報告了一件有趣新聞：「為了堅主考試嚴格，扶正學風事，特上書校長，贊成者請簽名。」</p>
<p>一時放下飯碗，爭往簽名者蜂湧一堆，兩張大白紙，立刻簽滿了名。</p>
<p>為了考試嚴格的緣故，復旦才有今日之地位，爬上二等國立大學。</p>
<p>「捲鋪蓋卷兒，就可以進去。」這是昔日一般人對私立復旦的看法。</p>
<p>八年辛苦爭來的校譽，豈容一旦付諸東流？復旦每個成員都有如是顧慮，致有今日上書校長之動機。</p>
<p>過去的光榮，未來的燦爛，能不能保持和發揚，這是一次不可多得的考騐。</p>
<p>更希望的，由於復旦同學之努力，影響到整個上海學風，矯正了一般考試弊病，使上海敎育界，另開生面，則今日此舉，更有其不朽的意義！</p>
<p>職業報告</p>
<h3>郵局裹的聽差</h3>
<p>— 新成</p>
<p>聽差——聽人指揮，受人差遣；如果單從「聽差」兩個字的涵義來推測這項職業，那么聽差的工作單是十分低微的。現在上海郵局內除了信差外，還有一批聽差。他們的人數僅及信差的五分之一，他們在名稱上雖舆信差同為差工，但以收入言，則遠不及信差。八一三前，由於郵局待遇上的優厚，又由於常有考選遞升的機會，所以郵局每次考試，不論是考郵務員，郵務佐，信差或聽差，應考者總是很多，來考試的人以能夠跨進道大門已滿足，他們認為做了一二年聽差後就可以做郵務佐的，而郵務佐而郵務員而郵務長，這是做聽差的希望，亦是每一個在郵界服務的希望。</p>
<p>你不要鄙視一個上海郵局的聽差，由聽差而做局長的在郵局的歷史上不是沒有；今日上海勞工界頜導者中有一個極有地位的亦是聽差出身！關於聽差每日的工作，因為郵局組織龐維，所以他們的工作大都是傅遞局內各部間的公文信函；近年來由於郵局的停止考試，一面是上海郵政當局洞悉上海聽差的程度，所以賣郵票，賣印花稅，封揀郵件……（郵務員佐的工作）亦慢慢由聽差來分負了。的確，聽差中的程度有很多是可以與員佐相比的。尤其是一九三九年一屆招進的幾位，他們至今大半還是二十幾歲的青年，其中有工業尃科學業被人稱為「工程師」的老谷，有在滬江大學即將半業的「會計師」小羅，以一個大學或尃科學業生來當一個聽差，這或者是社會的損失吧，可是一時找不到待遇較好的職位，他們亦祇能躭·躭·躭望著一個光明的將來。這羣年青的聽差，他們不因每日艱繁低屑的工作而消極，他們自已粗織了一個「精誠聯誼會」，藉此聯絡感情，增進學職，發掦互助精神，所謂「精誠所致，精石為開」。是他們今日的抱負，說不定十年後或二十年後，又會有幾個局長或幾個勞工領導者在這羣聽差中產生呢！</p>
<p>最后我有一個聲明，就是我寫本交的動機決不在特別褒獎他們，而在希望社會不該太低估了這些無名英雄，並且對於有前途·知勤勉的勞工，社會應該有所獎勵，應該特別重視他們！</p>

<p>（教育世家）迫溯司徒雷登博士的家傳：會祖父司徒羅勃，是美國肯塔其州的一所大學校長。祖父司徒托德，在同地創立「司徒大學」，是該省第一所女子大學。生父司徒約翰，是最早一批來華的傅教士中的一個，他目覩當日中國教育事業落後，便在杭州設立小學一所，但是為了格守教會規定，尃一宣傳教義，逍所學樣開辦不久，便被封閉了。</p>
<p>司徒雷登就在這時候——公歷一八七六年——生於杭州，他的母親芳名瑪麗·哈同，她和一般傳教士的妻室一樣，具有過人的才能舆堅忍。她偕同丈夫，兒女到北平居住時候，身兼主婦，裁縫，醫師，護士和教員等職務，寬厚溫柔舆熟烈，使她的人格深印衆人心中。雷登的道德品性，早年已受有優良的感染。</p>
<p>（在華長大）雷登是長子，他和弟妹們像中國孩童一般學習言語，他與父母難處在中國人中間生活。直到他十一歲時，方才被遣送回美國，他在祖國感到陌生與差異，但他以勇敢，忍耐的精神，克服了一切的困難。</p>

<h3>Large Quantities of Military Supplies Transported to Jiamusi; Communist Troops in Harbin Begin to Withdraw; Preparing to Blow Up the Songhua River Bridge</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] The Communist troops in Harbin are preparing to destroy the Songhua River Railway Bridge. For days, they have dispatched forty to fifty small riverboats to drill deep holes, about one foot in diameter, into all sides of the bridge's base using iron drills, filling them with explosives, ready to destroy it at any moment. Furthermore, the Communist troops have been using large carts to transport ammunition and important military supplies to Bin County, ninety miles east of Harbin, the purpose of which is unclear. Within Harbin, the Communist troops have already begun implementing "struggle sessions" and "purges."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 15th] Amidst the National Army's wedge-shaped advance towards Yan'an and Zhangjiakou, the Communist troops in Harbin have also begun withdrawing towards Jiamusi in the Northeast. The Songhua River Railway Bridge is prepared to be blown up, and Jiamusi may become the new headquarters for the Communist Party in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 15th] General Du Yuming has arrived in Guling to report to Chairman Chiang on the situation in the Northeast. Recent reports indicate that the Communist troops in the Northeast are actively preparing for war and are building a large airfield in Xi'anzi (transliteration).</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 15th] A certain officer of the US Army, having completed extensive travels in the areas controlled by both the Nationalist and Communist armies in the Northeast, returned to Beiping today and stated: The Northeast "is indeed a powder keg." Civil war will inevitably re-erupt "before the snow falls," and the climate in the Northeast has already turned cold. The Northeast side believes it is highly significant that Du Yuming, the Commander of the Northeast Security, flew to Guling to report to Chairman Chiang on the war situation in the Northeast at a time when the offensive by the government forces in North China was fierce. Although recent battles in the Northeast have been limited to small, intermittent clashes, both sides have made major troop deployments and redeployed their positions in preparation for a decisive battle. It is predicted that the fighting will erupt on the Songhua bridgehead halfway between Changchun and Harbin. The National Army has repeatedly attempted to rebuild the Songhua River Bridge, but each time construction begins, it is bombarded by the Communist troops across the river. The Communist troops have built fortifications in the areas along the Songhua River and the Lalin River between Harbin to prevent the National Army from advancing. If Harbin is subjected to a direct attack, the Communist troops will not defend it. The Communist troops are indeed transporting large quantities of equipment from Harbin to Jiamusi, a mountainous area 200 miles northeast of Harbin. Harbin is the location of Lin Biao's headquarters and the second largest city in the Northeast. "The situation is unusually quiet and empty." At the same time, along the railway line from Beiping to the Songhua River, Communist guerrillas are preparing to attack this lifeline, the only one through which the government enters the Northeast. The government's defenses along this railway line are inevitably weak due to its vast length, making it vulnerable to attack.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Increase Forces Around Zhangjiakou; National Army Advances in Wedge Shape; Conquered Jining Army Advances Rapidly Southward</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] According to related sources, the Communist troops are continuously reinforcing their forces around Zhangjiakou. The war in eastern Hebei is nearing its end, and they are wary. Therefore, they have been reinforcing their forces along the Hebei-Chahar border by as many as 8,000 troops in recent days and destroying bridges and highways between Kangzhuang and the fork in the road. They are building fortifications and engaging in small skirmishes from time to time, striving to gain the initiative. Since the 13th, they have launched a fierce attack on Changping, engaging in fierce fighting five li from Jucheng. Yesterday afternoon, they were still fighting with the defending troops.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] It is reported that the siege of Datong will soon be lifted. The defending troops inside the city are awaiting orders to attack. After the National Army conquered Jining, it continued southward along the railway line and is joining forces with the eastern and southeastern routes, advancing rapidly towards Zhangjiakou. Also, according to a New China News Agency dispatch from the Suidong front line on the 14th, the National Army admitted to capturing Jining on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Gui Sui, 14th (Urgent Telegram)] After the National Army completely recovered Jining, eleven brigades of Communist troops were defeated and retreated towards Xinghe Town. The National Army's battle results have not yet been fully investigated.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] The National Army is conducting a wedge-shaped offensive between Yan'an and Zhangjiakou, hoping to achieve the effect of separately breaking through. Military observers are paying attention to Hu Zongnan's army advancing northward from Xi'an towards Taiyuan, which will penetrate deep between Yan'an and Zhangjiakou, cutting off the communication between the Red Capital and the Northeast. According to the latest news, strong units of the National Army have reached Linfen, east of Yan'an. The government army's attack on Zhangjiakou will make the communication line between Chahar and the Communist troops in the nine northeastern provinces precarious.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] Yin Hanchu, the representative of the government in the Jining group; Dou Kuisi, the American representative; Zhang Hanshi, the Communist representative; and others from the group took a special plane of the Military Mediation Department back to Beiping last night. U.S. team member Lieutenant Clark had a piece of shrapnel graze his right foot, which has now healed. According to the government representative, the National Army, which recovered Jining, is advancing towards Fengzhen. There is no new progress on the Liangcheng front. The fighting for Jining was not too intense, and the damage inside the city was not severe. However, when the Communist troops retreated, they captured many of the city's able-bodied men. According to related sources here, the Communist troops may use the main force in northern Shanxi and eastern Suiyuan to defend to the death in Fengzhen to prevent the National Army from advancing eastward.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] There is no major change in the military situation in eastern Hebei today. Sun Zhenbang, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Hebei Province, is directing the work of demobilization, training the people, and using military force to repair roads in eastern Hebei in Tangshan. Everything is being actively promoted. The main force of the Communist troops in eastern Hebei is now concentrated in Panshan, west of Zunhua, north of Jixian, and east of Beiping. There are many temples and more than 2,000 caves in the mountain, which can all be used to garrison troops, making it difficult to attack. Most of the Great Wall line has been recovered by the National Army, with only Lengkou and Jielingkou still occupied by the Communist troops. The Xingyong area north of the Great Wall is also still the location of the main force of the Communist troops in Rehe Province. The puppet chairman of the Chinese Communist Party in Rehe Province and several factories are located there.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] The Pinggu Line (currently only open to Miyun) was previously damaged in the Shunyi area. The railway bureau ordered workers to rush repairs, and the entire line will be open to traffic within a month.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops' Instructions Expose Corruption and Misconduct</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 15th] According to a "Bohai Military Region Instruction" of the Communist troops obtained by the military, it is sufficient to prove that the Communist troops are corrupt and exploit the people. They are already unable to conceal this feeling within their ranks. The "Instruction" initially states, "Since the Great March, the mobility of the troops has been great, and the work has deviated from the norm." (The parentheses are quoted from the original sentence, as is done below.) It then lists the facts, saying: "All units are borrowing and eating indiscriminately everywhere, storing and releasing captured items haphazardly, and engaging in guerrilla warfare randomly, resulting in extreme disorder." "Troop production was once handed over to the government, and individual production personnel took this opportunity to fish in troubled waters, becoming corrupt, doing things wildly, causing waste of public finances and suffering enormous losses." In recent months, individual agencies and troops have still taken care of themselves, disregarding the whole, using things for their own purposes, disrespecting government laws and regulations, falsely reporting more, ambushing (the meaning of this sentence is unclear), and making empty plans for production, failing to solve practical problems, and relying on superiors and the government," and so on.</p>
<h3>Yan'an Enlists Militia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 15th] Military sources here revealed that the Joint Defense Headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party in Yan'an has begun to enlist a militia on a large scale. Each city north of Yan'an has a prescribed number of recruits, such as 1,800 in Suide, 1,500 in Mizhi, 2,000 in Jia County, and 1,500 in Qingjian, who are being trained locally. The Communist troops in northern Shanxi have also requisitioned horses, mules, oxen, and donkeys to organize transportation teams.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Occupy Belgian Church Property; Many Missionaries Flee from Shaanxi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] It is reported that the churches and church property of Belgium in the Sanbian area of Shaanxi have been confiscated due to the occupation of the area by the Communist troops. Furthermore, the Belgian and Chinese missionaries in the area have been unable to endure the extortion and oppression of the Communist Party and have mostly fled to other areas. Two have fled to Hengshan in Shaanxi, seven have fled to Sanshenggong in Dengkou, and five are currently being detained by the Communist troops. Our government is extremely concerned about this incident. In addition to the Shaanxi Provincial Government sending personnel to Hengshan to rescue the two, it is also sending personnel to investigate and rescue missionaries who have fled to other areas and allocating funds to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Xushang Section of Longhai Railway Begins Selling Tickets and Opening to Traffic</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] After the Xubian section of the Longhai Railway was damaged by the Communist troops, the railway bureau actively rushed to repair it. The Xushang section has started selling tickets and opening to traffic on the 15th. The section between Shangqiu and Kaifeng is still under repair.</p>
<h3>Heavy Artillery for Jiangyin Fortress to Be Transported from Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 15th] The director of the fortress has been sent to Taiwan to retrieve the heavy artillery, which is expected to arrive by ship soon.</p>
<h3>National Army in Shandong Advances from Yanzhou; Fierce Fighting Near Jining; Various Refugee Repatriation Groups Work Together</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 15th] The situation in Shandong Province has ensured the security of government strongholds due to the strengthening of the National Army's self-defense capabilities and the close cooperation between the party, government, military, and civilians. Furthermore, the recovery of several counties in southwestern Shandong has enhanced the stability of the people's hearts. A certain strong unit of our army advanced towards Jining from Yanzhou on the evening of the 14th to restore traffic between Yanzhou and Jining, support the National Army advancing northward to recover western Shandong, and assist refugees in returning to their hometowns. It is cooperating with local security forces and refugee repatriation groups from various counties. It is reported that they arrived near Jining early in the morning on the 15th and are engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist troops. The Communist troops in Shandong originally numbered more than 335,000. In addition to those transferred to northern Jiangsu, approximately 267,000 remain in Shandong Province. Approximately 50,000 to 60,000 are near Jinan, and more are distributed along the Jiaoji Railway Line. Judging by their actions, they are paying special attention to maintaining the transportation routes from Jiaodong through the Jiaoji Railway Line (near Caijiazhuang, east of Fangzi) to Linyi in southern Shandong, as this area is the corridor for the Communist troops from the Liaodong Peninsula to northern Jiangsu. The National Army's self-defense capabilities on the Jiaoji Railway Line are also extremely strong. It is widely believed that the goal of opening the entire Jiaoji Railway Line to traffic can be achieved. The Zibo coal mining area is Jinan's lifeline for fuel. Since the National Army recovered it, the Communist troops have deployed the main forces of their Qian Jun and Liao Rongbiao divisions in the vicinity, attacking the mining area from time to time, but have not succeeded. At present, the entire territory of Shandong is generally calm, but the Communist troops are recruiting soldiers and forming teams in various counties, indicating preparations for war. Furthermore, if the Communist troops suffer setbacks in northern Jiangsu, they will inevitably retreat into Shandong. Therefore, the National Army's self-defense work in Shandong will be very arduous in the future. It is reported that there are currently less than 10,000 Communist troops near Linyi. The 131st Brigade of the New Fourth Army has been moved to the Sipo area northeast of Hanzhuang to prevent the National Army from advancing northward. The Communist troops of the Bohai Military Region have recently been transporting large quantities of wheat to the Taihang Mountains from Dezhou, Pingyuan, Yucheng, and other counties in northern Shandong.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Coal Shortage Resolved; Over 9,000 Tons Shipped from Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 15th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Zhongdong coal transport ship has transported 9,700 tons of industrial coal from Keelung, Taiwan, which can temporarily solve the city's coal shortage.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Form Assassination Squad</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] The New Fourth Army's Chen Yi unit of the Communist troops has now formed an assassination squad, selecting and training elite cadres, approximately 200 in number, to specialize in infiltrating the National Army and carrying out assassinations.</p>
<h3>US Marines in Tangshan Considering Withdrawal; General Rockey Scheduled to Leave China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 15th] According to informal and reliable sources, the withdrawal of the US Marines from Tangshan is under consideration. The families of European employees of the Kailuan Coal Mine Bureau there are also reportedly preparing to evacuate. Hospitals in the area have been receiving civilians victimized in the fighting along the Beining Railway Line. The Communist troops recently destroyed the Linxi (transliteration) power plant and attacked the American troops escorting coal trains. Therefore, the National Army in the Tangshan area has been increased to two divisions. Furthermore, General Mu Tingfang, the commander of the 94th Army, arrived here from Tangshan on the 15th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] Lieutenant General Rockey, the commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin, is currently handing over his duties and is scheduled to leave China for San Francisco on the 20th to take up his new position as the head of the US Marine Corps Pacific Division.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The families of several American officers from the Military Mediation Department and various groups will arrive in Dagu from the United States on the 16th. The Lishi Society has prepared many residences.</p>
<h3>Youth League Cadres and Supervisors Leave Guling</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 15th] The personnel of the secretariat of the Second National Congress of the Youth League, led by Ni Wenya, left Guling and returned to Nanjing on the 15th. The Second Central Cadre Supervisory Committee also went down the mountain at the same time.</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Reveals Yan'an's Strategy; Demanding a Ceasefire Is Actually a Trick</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 15th] Today's "New York Times" editorial stated: "A series of military victories won by the Nationalist government forces led by Chairman Chiang have greatly reduced the Communist Party's desire to continue the civil war, and now they want to achieve a truce through General Marshall. However, Marshall remembers his past failures and the Communist Party's stubborn attitude in previous negotiations and seems unwilling to take action. If Chairman Chiang's victories can continue to progress, it may cause the Communist Party to participate in the National Assembly and restore an uneasy and temporary truce. Yan'an is engaged in political warfare, striving to publicize and exaggerate the Communist Party's significant and dubious victories in the Northeast, but recently Yan'an has shown a willingness to negotiate. The Communist Party, as in the past, seems ready to stop fighting temporarily, engage in negotiations, but even if some definite results are obtained in these negotiations, it is still very likely to be another tactical retreat. Based on past experience, this retreat may still be a trick of the Communist Party to gain a respite and use this opportunity to launch another political war on a larger scale."</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Arrives in Beiping from Zhengzhou to Inspect Northern Military Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, accompanied by Director Xu and Deputy Director Wu, flew to Beiping from Zhengzhou this afternoon to inspect northern military affairs. The heads of various military and political departments here went to the airport to welcome him. At noon, Director Li of the Executive Yuan held a banquet to welcome him, and then they went to the Diplomatic Building to rest. At 4:00 PM, they went to the summer camp in the western suburbs to give a speech to the graduating students.</p>
<h3>Beiping Summer Camp Graduates; Chen Cheng Gives Sincere Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng attended the graduation ceremony of the Beiping Youth League Summer Camp at 4:00 PM this afternoon and gave a speech, discussing the current situation and stating: The government earnestly hopes to resolve the political situation peacefully and strives to avoid fighting. If it is really impossible and forced to fight, that would be the worst policy. The downsizing of the army should still be carried out according to the original plan, that is, the government will maintain 90 divisions and the Chinese Communist Party will maintain 18 divisions. Speaking of the hardships of the youth, Chen denounced corrupt behavior indignantly, but said: Senior government leaders, such as the heads of the five Yuans, will never be corrupt, and ministers such as Wang Shijie and Yu Dawei live very frugally. Chen Cheng also said, "If I am corrupt, you should consider me an enemy." Chen requested that members of the Youth League actively support the government and grasp the revolutionary spirit. Chen said: "The issue of the affiliation of the Youth League will not change. However, in order to reorganize the league's affairs, a League Affairs Reorganization Committee will be established to decide all future reforms. Unemployed youth league members in Beiping will also be established a continuing education class, similar to Nanjing, to accommodate them."</p>
<h3>Zeng Qi Speaks in Changchun; Clarifies the Overall Situation; Adopts Constitution and Establishes Democracy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] Youth Party Chairman Zeng Qi said on the morning of the 14th: "The most important thing today is the realization of democratic politics, and democratic politics depends on the majority. All problems can be decided in Congress or by national referendum. This is truly an important plan to clarify the current situation. Therefore, what we should strive for at present is the formulation of a constitution so that democratic politics can be established." Zeng also stated that he had often resided in the Shenyang area during the years of the Republic (17, 18, 19), and that this trip to Changchun was his first. Zeng, through Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng, told reporters: "If you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know how big China is. If you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know how dangerous China is."</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government's Statement on Jurisdiction in Kowloon Walled City Does Not Conform to Regulations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 14th] A spokesman for the Hong Kong government issued a statement denying that the Kowloon Walled City is still Chinese territory and that China currently exercises jurisdiction there. It is claimed that the 1898 Beijing Treaty agreed to establish a 99-year lease of the New Territories, delineating the British leased territory with the Shenzhen River to the Maggot Bay border. The lease did not state that the Kowloon Walled City was not included. The treaty stipulated that the Chinese officials stationed in the Kowloon Walled City at that time could continue to exercise administration provided it did not hinder British military needs, but by 1899, the Chinese officials' administration in the Kowloon Walled City had conflicted with British military needs and should be terminated. For fifty years, the British authorities have exercised jurisdiction in the Kowloon Walled City, just as in the Kowloon New Territories area. According to the 1898 Contract for the Extension of the British New Leased Territory in Hong Kong, which states that "Chinese officials stationed in the Kowloon Walled City can still perform their duties," the Hong Kong side's unilateral statement this time clearly does not conform to the contract regulations.</p>
<h3>Isoya and Tani Hisao to Be Escorted to the Capital for Public Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The official documents for escorting Japanese war criminals Tani Hisao and Isoya Renosuke to the capital have been delivered to the War Crimes Trial Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense.

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Returns to the Capital; Says He Is Satisfied with the Performance at the Peace Conference; Allied Nations Value Our War of Resistance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie flew back to Nanjing from Kunming at 4:15 PM on the 15th. Wang left China eight weeks ago to attend the European Peace Conference and returned home early at the request of the Chairman. Accompanying him were external secretaries Zhou Shukai and others. In addition to Vice Minister Gan Naiguang and the heads of various departments, those who welcomed him at the airport included French Ambassador Meyrier, Australian Minister Copland, British Embassy Counselor Waley, US Embassy Counselor Walter White (White representing Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart), Vice Minister of Propaganda Xu Xiaoyan, Vice Minister of Education Hang Liwu, Luo Jialun, etc., and their wives. Wang was wearing a gray suit, holding a white straw hat, and looked energetic. He smiled as he got off the plane and shook hands with each of the greeters. French Ambassador Meyrier was the first to step forward and asked, "Did you enjoy Paris?" Wang replied, "Very much." Then Walter White immediately conveyed the greetings of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart to Wang. Wang also answered several questions from reporters at the airport as follows: Q: What was your impression of France when you were in Paris? A: I am very grateful for the thoughtful hospitality of the French authorities. Q: The relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is confusing. What is Foreign Minister Wang's opinion? A: I believe that the United States and the Soviet Union will eventually cooperate. Q: What is the general situation of this peace conference? A: This peace treaty is fairer than the last peace treaty, such as the declaration by Britain and the United States not to demand reparations from the defeated countries, which is one example. Then Wang drove back to his residence. After resting briefly, he went to Secretary-General Wu's office to chat. Wang then met with reporters at his residence and said of his views on the peace conference: At this peace conference, I advocated that the treatment of military issues should be stricter in principle, and the treatment of political and economic issues should be more lenient. As for the issue of colonies, I advocated that they should not be regarded as spoils of war by any victorious country. The performance of the peace conference is not very different from our country's proposals and ideals, which is still satisfactory. As for the process of this peace conference, he said: The peace conference should be able to achieve results in a month. It is not yet possible to confirm what the results will be. Although there are disputes over the Five-Power Treaty, it can definitely be signed. Regarding the issue of reparations in the treaty, Britain and the United States have declared that they will give up. I also never mentioned the issue of compensation at the peace conference. After the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Italy, although not suffering losses, also demanded compensation. In this war, the damage suffered by overseas Chinese in Italy was very great, but I did not want to raise the issue of compensation in order to enable the democratic and free people of Italy to come to the fore and not to allow the remaining Fascists to use the harsh conditions as an excuse to make a comeback. The above are all examples of the fairness of this peace treaty. Regarding the Italian issue, Wang also said: The main issue lies in the treatment of the colonies. If Libya can achieve independence, or achieve independence within a certain period of time under the trusteeship of the United Nations, and China's proposal can be realized, then this peace conference will be more successful than the last one. Also, it was reported that Foreign Minister Wang will hold a press conference within days to report on the process of attending the peace conference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 14th] Provincial Chairman Lu Han hosted a banquet on the evening of the 14th to welcome Foreign Minister Wang. During the banquet, Wang said: (1) The Paris Peace Conference will definitely have results in a month. The future of the international situation is not as dangerous as rumored. However, whether the major powers can fully cooperate depends on whether a satisfactory solution to the German issue can be found. (2) The Allied nations attach great importance to China's past contributions to the War of Resistance and its future development. We must work hard to find domestic unity and peace. The work of China's revival must not be delayed any longer.</p>
<h3>Special Envoy Marshall's Audience with the Chairman: First Extended Conversation After Eight Ascents to Lushan; British Newspaper Praises Special Envoy's Proposal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 15th] Special Envoy Marshall went to the Chairman's residence at 5 p.m. on the 15th for an audience, the first meeting after eight ascents to Guling. The meeting lasted a considerable time.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The 15th was another regular Sunday holiday, and everyone is waiting to see what happens after Special Envoy Marshall returns to Nanjing. There is still no confirmation as to whether Special Envoy Marshall will return to Nanjing on the 16th. On the morning of the 15th, Special Envoy Marshall made a long-distance call from Guling to his aide, Colonel Ke Yi. Colonel Ke Yi happened to be visiting Ambassador Stuart at 9 a.m. and was unable to take the call. Ke Yi and Stuart talked for an hour before leaving. It is reported that Jing Bo visited Zhou Enlai at 12 p.m. but did not meet him, only talking with Wang Bingnan for about half an hour. It is said that Fu is still trying to persuade the Communist Party to participate in an informal five-person group meeting, hoping to start with political issues. The Communist Party said that Fu's visit was a normal courtesy call and did not involve anything else, because the Communist Party has firmly rejected the five-person group meeting. In the afternoon, the ambassador went to church for worship and had no other activities.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Zhang Li-sheng told reporters on the 15th that we are still expecting the Communist Party to participate in the informal five-person group meeting, because when the proposal for the meeting was put forward in August, the Communist Party had expressed its agreement.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 15th] Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, formally submitted a written application to Special Envoy Marshall's residence today, requesting the reopening of the military three-person group meeting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th] The Yorkshire Post published a commentary on the 14th, saying that Stuart's proposal to form a five-person group is "a good policy for China." It also said: "A glimmer of hope has now been discovered, which may eventually produce practical results." The newspaper believes that the special envoy can lead the group to success, and the favorable conditions it cited are as follows: (1) The superior government forces have recently caused the rapid retreat of the Communist forces; (2) The people fear war and have more tools to express their wishes than before. The newspaper concluded: "The Kuomintang must understand the power of public opinion. The people are happy to accept the Kuomintang's advice and its experience in cooperating with other political parties. The Communists must reflect on themselves. They can participate in the government and engage in internal reform to serve the peasants, instead of insisting on insurrectionary means, which will damage the country, obstruct transportation, and strike at commercial and economic development."</p>
<h3>Our New Fleet Ordered to Qingdao</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The new fleet docked at Xiaguan has been ordered to Qingdao. The flagship Taikang and six other ships, including Yongsheng, will sail to Shanghai on the 18th to join the Taiping and Yongxing ships and head north.</p>
<h3>Hai'an Situation Stabilized; Communist Troops in Xinghua and Dongtai Hastily Build Fortifications</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 15th] Hai'an news: The Communist army's attempt to capture Hai'an has been completely crushed. The situation in Hai'an is now unusually stable, with only sporadic battles on the periphery.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 15th] It is learned that the Communist army is currently actively building air defense fortifications in the Xinghua and Dongtai areas, with the aim of avoiding the threat of government air force to its cadres and troops.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 15th] A person from Zhangdian said: "The Communist army slaughtered many innocent people when they invaded Zhangdian this time, totaling about a hundred people, most of whom were township and village chiefs."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 15th] The Communist army is forcibly conscripting young men in the Dongtai area, who are used as the first line in combat. The second line is children, the third line is militia, the fourth line is the Communist army's infantry, the fifth line is machine gunners, and the last is artillery. This method of using the people as cannon fodder has caused great panic among the residents in the bandit areas, and more and more people are fleeing across the river with their families.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 15th] Jingjiang news: The garrison and self-defense forces searched Zhengdongwei in the western district the night before last and opened fire with the remnants of the Communist army in front of Siweigang, capturing more than a hundred shi of public grain from the Communist side and returning safely. Also, County Magistrate Yang of Nantong recently led a team to inspect the eastern countryside to appease the people and encountered a battle with the Communist army in a hotel. They were defeated and returned to the city safely after three days. The Baipu to Rugao section of the Tongru Highway will be repaired and open to traffic within days.</p>

<h3>United States to Adjust Far East Policy: Seeking to Prevent the Spread of Communist Threats; Truman's Attitude Towards the Soviet Union Awaits Clarification</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Government officials said that the increasingly tense relations between the United States and the Soviet Union may prompt the United States to readjust its Far East policy. The most immediate consequence will be the United States' aid to the Chinese National Government with power and materials to deal with the spread of Communist threats in the Far East. The source emphasized that no decision has been made yet, and no decision will be made until Truman's contradictory attitude towards the Soviet Union is clarified. Some actions taken by the United States in the Far East recently have been interpreted by observers as being caused by the increasingly fractured relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union in other regions. When the United States cannot obtain Soviet cooperation in unifying Korea, it is determined to proceed with the development of the political and economic work of southern Korea on its own, and the transaction of 800 million yuan of surplus materials between the United States and the Chinese National Government is a clear indication of this trend. However, government officials who decide policies stated that this statement is not correct. They claimed that the United States' actions in Korea, like its actions in other parts of the Far East, are motivated by the fact that these actions are the most effective way to solve local problems, and they deny that there has been any change in the United States' policy in Korea. However, in any case, people here have practically given up hope for the success of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart's mediation of the Chinese Civil War. The general opinion is that the Chinese Civil War will continue for some time, and it is felt that the United States, whether it wants to or not, will be forced to support Chairman Chiang with materials and advice. The responsible source pointed out: The United States cannot meet ideal standards for the governments of other regions, but if its opponent is a Communist, it will resolutely support the government. If the United States decides to readjust its policy toward China, the first result will be to immediately allocate the 500 million yuan loan already designated for the Export-Import Bank of China, because the applications for loans from other countries must be decided before the end of the year, so a decision must be made on the loan to China, so that if China cannot obtain it, it can be allocated to other countries.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 15th] Today's editorial in Pravda accused the US military presence in China as the source of China's misfortune. It said: "The stationing of this army can only contribute to the misfortune of the Chinese people, and the US material aid to the Chinese government army is another example of the US intervention policy. This move is completely contrary to the decisions made at the Foreign Ministers Conference."</p>
<h3>Qian Gonglai Talks to Reporters About the Takeover Work in the Northeast; Besides Materials and People's Hearts, We Should Also Take Over Tears</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] Qian Gonglai, the head of the Northeast Region Takeover and Investigation Team, and his party of ten took a car to Yongji at 1 p.m. on the 14th for inspection. A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanied them. Before the trip, Chief Qian met with the Central News Agency reporter alone and talked about the situation of the takeover work in the Northeast. Qian told the reporter with extremely excited words: "Some people say that the takeover is not about materials, but about people's hearts. In fact, in addition to materials and people's hearts, we should also take over tears." Under the enemy's pressure and coercion, the Northeast has been built up over the past fourteen years. However, many of these constructions have been promoted by the blood, sweat, technology, and tears of our Northeast compatriots. Now that the country is restored, the government should focus on giving full play to the experience and technology that our Northeast compatriots have exchanged with blood and tears. All technical talents who have worked in the production and technical departments of various institutions, such as mines, electrical chemistry, hygiene, medicine, etc., should be put to good use and not be ignored, because the work of rejuvenation really depends on them. The government has not yet announced it. Those who have served as officials in the puppet Manchukuo government will not be allowed to serve in existing agencies under any circumstances. Qian believes that there must be clear regulations on this, because recently, several letters of this nature have been received in the secret mailbox. Qian concretely stated that those who served in the puppet Manchukuo era and were directly involved in the work of conscription, investigation, and distribution, and who are suspected of disturbing and harming the people, should be avoided from being hired. Those who have reformed and are seeking a new life cannot be appointed as supervisors, but can only be given lower positions so that they cannot arbitrarily make claims and cause trouble to the people again. As for those who have been engaged in investigative work in the past, they cannot be allowed to continue to engage in work of the same nature, so as not to hurt the hearts of the people."</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province's Takeover of Materials; Many Are Bound to Be Concealed; Zhong Pusheng Reports at the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 15th] Zhong Pusheng, director of the Zhejiang Office of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions, reported to the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly that the estimated value of various takeover materials in Zhejiang is: about 2 billion for materials, 1.3 billion for enemy and puppet properties, 1.4 billion for factories, and more than 70 million yuan in cash. In addition, there are about 2 billion in Ningbo and Jiaxing. However, most of the enemy and puppet materials in Ningbo were taken over by the navy, and the takeover investigation team will go to Qingzha in the cold storage in Dinghai. Zhong also said that the value of the remaining materials handed over by various parties has reached 2 billion yuan. Based on this, it can be inferred that there must still be many materials concealed in various places.</p>
<h3>Military Supplies Department Takes Over Non-Military Supplies; The Investigation Team is Ordered to Make a List and Hand It Over</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Nanjing Takeover and Investigation Team recently discovered that the Military Supplies Department took over more than 3,000 types of non-military supplies due to different interpretations. The team ordered it to make a list and hand it over to the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau.</p>
<h3>People from All Walks of Life in Shandong Province Telegraph the United States to Oppose the Transfer of Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 15th] The matter of the United Nations transferring steel rails to Yugoslavia that were originally intended for China has aroused unanimous indignation from all walks of life in Shandong. On the 14th, more than 100 units, including fellow villagers' associations from various counties in Jinan, held a joint meeting and decided to send a telegram to President Truman and American celebrities to uphold justice and transport all the relief materials to China. The meeting also noted that with the approach of winter, millions of refugees in Shandong are suffering from hunger and cold. The central government has allocated 1 billion yuan for emergency relief, which is a drop in the bucket. In addition to sending a telegram to Gu Zhenggang to express gratitude and request more relief funds, it was also requested that the central government increase the amount of funds to save the refugees from suffering, and requested that the Shandong and Qingdao Relief Divisions quickly raise winter clothing for the refugees.</p>
<h3>United Nations Railway Materials to Be Shipped from England to China Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th] It was learned here today that a large number of railway bridge materials, under the auspices of the United Nations, will be shipped from England to China to solve China's serious railway transportation problems. The materials to be transported include 904 complete bridges, weighing 42,000 tons and valued at 2 million pounds, which will be dismantled and shipped for use in Shanghai and Guangzhou, where they will be assembled by engineers. These materials will be shipped as soon as the United Nations cancels the order to stop shipping materials to China issued in July, and are expected to arrive in China in October.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Have Drafted Measures for the Management of Civil Aviation Operations; Civil Aviation Companies Must Meet Standards for Registration</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Regarding the registration and management of civil aviation operations, the relevant authorities drafted a measure in May of this year and are now submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval. According to the draft, civil aviation companies must first have the necessary conditions in terms of aviation equipment and personnel in order to be approved for registration. Their fares and operations must also meet the regulations. Those that do not meet the standards will naturally not be approved. In the future, the registration and management of civil aviation companies will be based on this measure. At the same time, the establishment of civil aviation companies must also be after the law is passed. It is rumored that a certain civil aviation company has suffered heavy losses because it cannot operate publicly. According to relevant parties, the company's license was revoked, and the situation is not as simple as rumored. It cannot be concluded from this that the government does not intend to support private civil aviation operations. As for the losses suffered by the company as a result, the company itself should be responsible. It is heard that the company's organization is extremely large and seems to be very extravagant, while in terms of equipment, etc., it does not meet the standards. At most, there were only five aircraft, which were later transferred to another company. If the company "defects" to Hong Kong, the government will naturally treat it as a foreign company. However, the Sino-British Aviation Agreement has not yet been drafted, and it may be difficult for the company's aircraft to stay in Shanghai for a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Lu Shizeng, President of the Yunnan High Court, Is Accused of Illegal Conduct</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 14th] Lu Zhusheng, a merchant from Zhejiang Province, accused Lu Shizeng, president of the Yunnan High Court, of interfering in lawsuits and shielding criminal cases. After learning about this, the People's Freedom Protection Committee stated that the judiciary in Yunnan Province has been dark for several years, and the people have been exploited and trampled on, with no way to appeal. The President of the High Court, Lu, is biased and dare not enforce the law. Recently, it has become even worse, and the President of the Court himself has also committed dereliction of duty and illegal acts. If this continues, the people will be unable to bear it. In order to completely eradicate corruption and alleviate the people's suffering, the association has telegraphed the central government, requesting a strict meeting to deal with all kinds of dereliction of duty and illegal acts of the President of the Court.</p>
<h3>National Judicial Administration Conference Scheduled for January Next Year; Minister Xie Arrives in Suzhou Yesterday for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 15th] Xie Guansheng, Minister of Judicial Administration, and Counselor Ni Zheng, arrived in Suzhou from Shanghai by a special train at 10:07 a.m. on the 15th. Sun, President of the Local High Court, Han, Chief Prosecutor, Zai, President of the District Court, Guan, Chief Prosecutor, and more than 30 other people from the judiciary in the local area welcomed them at the station. After Minister Xie got off the train, he took a car directly to the office of the President of the Suzhou High Court for a rest and met with reporters from various newspapers to answer questions and elaborate on the issue of the families of the Chinese traitors detained throughout Jiangsu Province requesting that the cases of the traitors be included in the amnesty. This can only be approved after the Legislative Yuan has passed it. As for the amnesty regulations that have already been stipulated, the Chinese traitors are not included in them. The reason why it has not been promulgated so late is because it has been ordered by the Chairman to postpone the matter. He then mentioned the issue of judicial personnel avoiding their native places. The newly dispatched personnel have already implemented it, and the originally appointed personnel are being adjusted one after another. Finally, he informed reporters that the National Judicial Administration Conference will be held in January next year. Xie inspected the detention center of the High Court at 11 a.m. and paid special attention to the health of the detainees. At 12 noon, he inspected the District Court and the detention center. Seeing that the prison was narrow, he personally instructed President Wang to use the open space in the back to add a prison. At 2:30 p.m., he visited the Third Prison and praised the completeness of the equipment. In the evening, he stayed at the residence of a local gentry, Mr. Xu. He will attend the anniversary week of the High Court at 16 a.m. and give a speech. He will take a special train back to Shanghai and then to Hangzhou at 4 p.m.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Water Level Rises Suddenly; Continuous Autumn Rains are Noteworthy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th] With the arrival of autumn, the water level of the Yangtze River has continued to rise since the heavy rain on the evening of the 13th.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 15th] Shao Lizi came to Hangzhou on the 13th to visit the scenic spots of the lake and mountains.

According to Shao, who spoke to the reporter of this newspaper, this is his first visit to Hangzhou after the victory, but it is just like a commoner visiting his hometown relatives. He has no other mission. His impression of Hangzhou is that although the lake and mountains are still the same, the vitality has not yet recovered, and the government and the people are constantly striving to build it. Also, he is expected to return to the countryside for three days, and after visiting, he will return to Hangzhou and then to Nanjing.</p>

<h3>南昌 News</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Fang Canglang</p>
<p>The seven-member Nanchang Visiting Group of reporters stationed in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan have arrived in Nanchang for five days. They have been visiting various provincial government agencies and legal entities. They have attended four public banquets hosted by the party, government, military, and Nanchang business associations. In the next two days, they will continue to visit Zhongzheng University and various schools in the urban area.</p>
<p>People of Jiangxi Eagerly Await the Chairman's Arrival</p>
<p>Various sectors of the provincial capital are calling Guling dozens of times a day to inquire about the chairman's itinerary.</p>
<p>Nanchang currently has a population of 200,000. The citizens are known for their frugality, and their diet and lifestyle are in accordance with the essentials of moderation. In the evening, walking on the streets, one sees colorful arches inscribed with "Welcome the Head of State," illuminated by electric lights, dazzling to the eye. The citizens on the bustling streets mostly wear short clothes made of cloth. Most of the fashionable, modern women are from elsewhere, and the number of women with permed hair and lipstick is very small.</p>
<p>Rebuilding Nanchang Requires a Huge Expenditure</p>
<p>The repair work on the roads within the Nanchang urban area has begun. The sewer project is expected to be completed smoothly with the assistance of the Jiangxi branch of the Relief Administration. This project requires more than 16,600,000 yuan, entirely donated by the Jiangxi branch. It is said that the original sewer in the urban area was a foul-smelling open drain 750 meters long. If a person were to put a finger into the filthy water of this drain, it would immediately fester. After the completion of this project, East Lake, the only scenic area in the urban area, will not smell bad year-round because the sewage will not drain into the lake.</p>
<p>Before the war, Nanchang had a total of 46,000 houses. Current surveys show that only 11,000 remain. According to Nanchang Mayor Tang Xin, who told this newspaper's reporter, only 600 houses have been newly built since September last year. It is estimated that it will cost 46 billion yuan to repair all the houses and roads in the city to restore Nanchang.</p>
<p>Nanchang's East Lake scenic area, such as Jiang Gong Causeway, Qingyunpu, the magnificent Martyrs' Cemetery, and the province's extensive, spiderweb-like highways, were all great constructions during the chairman's tenure in the province overseeing the suppression of bandits. The lakeside, tree-lined Jieshi Park is where the citizens of Nanchang will forever remember the chairman's command in Jiangxi to suppress the bandits, save the people of Jiangxi, and the great achievements of his construction. The park is now Nanchang's only cool retreat.</p>
<p>The People are Pure and Simple, and Prices are Very Low</p>
<p>Nanchang is located on the east bank of the Gan River and is the political and economic center of the province. However, because the citizens live frugally and have weak purchasing power, speculators and hoarders mostly do not dare to try their hand here. Most speculative capital flows to Shanghai and Wuhan. The interest rates on loans from local money houses and wealthy individuals reached a maximum of 15% after the war, but are now hovering between 8% and 8.5%. There are no usurious loans in Nanchang, so prices are lower than in the southeastern provinces. From an economic perspective, one can see the beauty of the simple nature of the Jiangxi people and the steady style of Jiangxi merchants.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the Nanchang Municipal Government and the reporter's investigation, after this foreign exchange adjustment, Nanchang prices fluctuated very little. In summary, of the 89 types of goods, only 37 types of imported goods and foreign cigarettes saw a slight increase, but the highest price increase did not exceed 30%. Among them, wool serge increased by only 3% or 4%, which shows that there are indeed not many speculators in Nanchang.</p>
<p>The highest prices in Jiangxi Province are in Jiujiang, followed by Pingxiang and Ganzhou, and the lowest is in eastern Jiangxi. Nanchang prices are the most stable. The current price of top-grade rice is 30,000 yuan per picul, pork is 1,200 yuan per catty, tea oil is 700 yuan per catty, and lard is 1,300 yuan per catty. Recently, there has been a prolonged drought with no rain, and the average late rice harvest is less than 70%.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Politics Really Wants to Move Forward</p>
<p>Wang Lingji, the current chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, has been in office for less than half a year, and his achievements remain to be seen. Some say that Jiangxi's politics were static in the past, but now they really want to move forward. Chairman Wang Lingji has his own way of using people. He is afraid that cunning officials will tear down the platform and ruin the grassroots politics of Jiangxi. He does not dare to easily select those with extensive county magistrate experience and is currently testing them.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of Jiangxi Province's 83 counties and cities were directly affected by the war. Only more than ten counties such as Ningdu and Ruijin were spared from war damage. However, although this year's harvest is declared to be a bumper one, the farmers are still miserable and in dire need of relief. There are 1.3 million displaced people in urgent need of relief. They hope that the Relief Administration will provide more material relief, especially food and clothing. They do not need beef jerky, canned goods, or high heels.</p>
<p>Jiangxi's biggest difficulty at the moment is "difficulty in rehabilitation." The total amount of rehabilitation funds requested by the provincial government reached 56 billion yuan, but the Executive Yuan only gave 600 million yuan. The rehabilitation funds for mountain education only amounted to 200 million yuan. This amount is only enough to rehabilitate one middle school, so one can imagine the situation for the rest.</p>
<p>New Political Style of Director Li of the Department of Civil Affairs</p>
<p>The newly appointed Director of the Jiangxi Department of Civil Affairs, Li Zhongxiang, is very determined to reform Jiangxi's county administration. He recently planned to inspect all the counties in the province. According to those who interviewed him, the old method of governing politics is "perfunctory," but that has passed. Now, one should be down-to-earth and do practical work. He very much wants to establish a new political style in Jiangxi of "doing it when you see it, doing it when you think of it," and never engage in empty talk.</p>
<p>The most troubling disease for the Jiangxi health administration is none other than the plague in Guangze County on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi. The history of the plague there goes back more than 30 years. During the Anti-Japanese War, the plague spread from Guangze and Nancheng counties to five counties. Although foreign plague expert Burris made many efforts, it has not been eradicated. The plague's epidemic period is late autumn and early winter. It is said that preventive injections have already begun in the epidemic areas of eastern Jiangxi. According to an experienced colleague, the two main reasons why the plague cannot be eradicated in Jiangxi Province are a shortage of funds and the lack of effort from county administrators.</p>
<p>In remote counties in Jiangxi, there is a custom of armed clashes, sometimes lasting for several years. Now, villagers in Fenyi County are fighting again over village mergers and the fight for resources. It is said that hundreds of people have been killed or injured. This matter also deserves attention in Jiangxi, where manpower is not abundant.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>US Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>After US Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a speech in Germany reiterating his policy toward Germany, Commerce Secretary Wallace suddenly delivered a speech in New York a few days later, strongly arguing that it was necessary to change the course of US foreign policy. These two different tones exposed the differences in opinion on foreign policy that are brewing in the United States. People all over the world are waiting for President Truman's decision. Especially Britain, which heard these two diametrically opposed arguments within five days, felt like it had a fever, hot for a while, and then cold for a while.</p>
<p>President Truman's final statement was finally issued the day before yesterday (the 14th). He said: "My original intention was only to express my support for Secretary Wallace's right to make this speech, but I did not intend to express my support for making this speech a statement of our country's foreign policy." He also said: "Our government's established foreign policy has not changed; and foreign policy cannot be subject to any major changes without discussion between the president and the secretary of state, as well as the leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives." The uproar caused by Wallace's speech in the American diplomatic community can therefore return to calm, and countries around the world that are concerned about American foreign policy can also rest assured.</p>
<p>Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper pointed out that Ye's speech would inevitably lead to divisions in the American diplomatic community and even the formation of a struggle between two lines. Only President Truman could make a clear statement to eliminate this consequence invisibly. At this moment, we have learned of President Truman's statement and know that there is no change in American foreign policy, which is of course within our expectations. However, the United States is a democratic country after all, and all domestic and foreign policies and guidelines are based on public opinion. Wallace is the only remaining minister from the era of the late President Roosevelt, and his pro-Soviet remarks will obviously win the approval of a group of radicals. Therefore, internal American views on foreign policy will still be at risk of diverging for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>However, in today's international situation, which is as chaotic as hemp, the work of creating world peace is feeling difficult and heavy, and the United States bears a major responsibility for the creation of peace. The United States must unite from top to bottom and jointly support American foreign policy in order to benefit world peace. As Republican leader Vandenberg said: "American foreign policy relies entirely on domestic unity as its backing, so the Republican and Democratic parties both face the world with a united American front. This is the only way to find peace." We also know that the Democratic Party and the Republican Party in the United States have had largely similar foreign policies over the years, with very few differences. If differences arise in the future, it will not only be difficult for American foreign policy to succeed internationally, but it will also cause a serious reaction to the international situation, and the result will be that the United States itself will ultimately suffer. May American policy, after this uproar, be able to return to calm and remain as firm as ever, using its full strength to support the unity of the democratic countries of the world and strengthen the position and power of the United Nations organization, in order to protect the freedom and peace that humanity should enjoy.</p>
<p>The Target of the Investigation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council passed a resolution the day before yesterday to select five senators to participate in the Investigation Team for the Rehabilitation Work in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Area to assist the first group of the team in intensifying their work. This naturally shows that the four million people of Shanghai all want to have a thorough investigation of the rehabilitation work of the past year. However, we must first recognize the target to be investigated.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Investigation Team was based on the resolution of the last Political Consultative Conference. Although the task it is responsible for is extremely important, the investigation period is very short. How can such an important task be completed in just 50 days? This is of course a serious problem. However, in all fairness, although the investigation teams in various places have not achieved brilliant results, it cannot be said that they have not achieved considerable results. First, the investigations in various places have discovered many major cases. In addition to those that have been reported in the newspapers, there are many other important cases that are said to have been secretly submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval. This is unknown to the outside world. Even in Shanghai alone, the number of cases discovered is not small. Second, wherever the investigation team goes, people who have made "rehabilitation money" have to be more cautious. Some rehabilitation officials even hate the informants with a vengeance, calling them "not born of their parents." It is not necessarily a bad thing that the investigation team can make the petty thieves hate them.</p>
<p>However, the political, military, and economic rehabilitation agencies in various places have been carrying out rehabilitation work for more than a year, and the number of materials, factories, real estate, land, vehicles, and all other properties they have accepted is very large. To take just the catalog as an example, it may require cartloads. The investigation team has a limited number of people. In addition to the team leader and members, there are only a few secretaries and staff, and the office expenses are pitifully small. How can these catalogs be investigated one by one? Therefore, only a part of the investigation can be completed in 50 days, and the central government must be requested to extend the investigation time as soon as possible. It is said that the central government has approved the extension to the end of this month. But we predict, what good can be achieved by extending it for another half month? The Shanghai Municipal Council accepted the invitation of the investigation team and decided to send personnel to participate in the work, which is also what we are happy to hear. But what good tune can be sung by only participating in a "coda" section? We can't help but feel a bit worried for the five senators!</p>
<p>When the restored areas saw the light of day again, they all warmly welcomed and wholeheartedly supported the central government. However, because the rehabilitation officials who represented the government to the restored areas only knew how to rehabilitate materials and houses and neglected the hearts of the people in the restored areas, Chairman Chiang had to comfort them and send rehabilitation officials to "rehabilitate the hearts of the people" again. However, the reputation and prestige of the government have already been ruined by these rehabilitation officials. Therefore, we believe that the target of the investigation team's work should be the rehabilitation agencies and rehabilitation officials to investigate whether they are honest, and should not be the people in the restored areas again, making these people who are crying and helpless suffer another round of coercion. Even if corruption and fraud are discovered in the rehabilitation work, it is inevitable that the people will be involved, but those who should be punished should first be the officials who committed rehabilitation fraud, and it should not be possible to humiliate the people who have been repeatedly defrauded before. If the investigation work recognizes the wrong target, that is not conducive to "rehabilitating the hearts of the people," but instead makes the people in the restored areas more confused and uneasy. This should not be the original intention of the investigation team organization, right?</p>
<p>Advice on the Unemployment Problem</p>
<p>The unemployment problem is too serious at the moment. Several proposals and inquiries in the Municipal Council mentioned this problem; and many people urged the government why it did not find a way to solve it earlier. This is of course correct. However, the government itself does not have so many buildings. Without the great efforts of the central government, the principle of Yu Er Hu Ba cannot be forcibly implemented by the factories. Therefore, although the method is very correct, it is obviously not enough to rely solely on this method to solve the unemployment problem.</p>
<p>Someone suggested holding cooperative factories to accommodate these workers; this is also correct. The problem lies in the factories, raw materials, funds, and other prerequisite issues. Even if they are all smoothly resolved, can all these unemployed workers be accommodated? Can their working skills completely match? Are they all willing to join? These are obviously still problems. Therefore, although the method is correct, it is still not enough to rely solely on this method to solve the unemployment problem.</p>
<p>Some people advocate holding large-scale public works to accommodate these workers; this is also correct. There have been many precedents at home and abroad), the central government has issued a clear order, and the city has also held labor relief, absorbing a considerable number of unemployed workers. But unfortunately, the unemployed are still unemployed. It can be seen that although the method is correct, it is still not enough to rely solely on this method to solve the unemployment problem.</p>
<p>Some people strongly advocate that all the enemy and puppet factories that have been rehabilitated should be reopened; this is of course even more correct. However, those that have already started operating are forced to stop operating (recently, it was heard that two textile construction factories have stopped operating). How can those that have not started operating be reopened? Recently, factories in various places have been sold by tender, and there is even no owner. How tragic! It can be seen that the method is not wrong, but it is obviously not enough to rely solely on this method to solve the unemployment problem.</p>
<p>Some people think that since it is not easy to place them, why not hold small loans to temporarily maintain their lives? This is also correct. We conservatively estimate that there are currently 50,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai. If each person is given a loan of 100,000 yuan in national currency, then the total will be 5 trillion yuan. How to raise this huge sum of money, let's not ask for now; but if so many hawkers are added to the market, is there so much business for them to do? Isn't the government now strictly cracking down on stalls? Old stalls are still being cracked down on, how can new stalls be allowed? It can be seen that the method of small loans is also correct, but it is still not enough to rely solely on this method to solve the unemployment problem.</p>
<p>Some people think that most of these workers are not locals, especially those from the rear, and are not local workers. Since the city has no place to place them, it may as well raise a sum of money to send them back to their hometowns. This is also not wrong, but it is close to using the neighbor as a drain and is fundamentally incomplete. Moreover, many have suffered from the war and are already homeless. In the areas disturbed by the Communist Party in northern Jiangsu, we are too late to appease and comfort them, let alone bear to send them forcibly? It can be seen that the method is a method, but it is neither practical nor thorough to rely on this method to solve the unemployment problem.</p>
<p>Unemployment is a social morbidity, especially the social morbidity of China at this time. The root cause is not just one or two. Many are affected by the war, and many are still "man-made" unemployment after the war. We believe that there is no real panacea that can be used to cure the disease and uproot the unemployment disease at this time. Negative relief should always start from many aspects and rely on the efforts of the majority, with different routes leading to the same goal and advancing separately, which may turn the heavy into the light and turn the danger into a blessing. What we think is most important is still that the government should rest and recuperate with the people, so that the people can take care of themselves and restore their vitality. Factories can be opened, business can "make a living," open up more ways for them to make a living, and reduce some hard-working activities that take away their jobs, so that the already unemployed can gradually become employed, and those who are employed must never be made unemployed again. We feel that many of the government's methods now, intentionally or unintentionally, are creating unemployment, promoting unemployment, and increasing unemployment. This is a very disheartening thing!</p>

<h3>Eloquent Discussion on the Trieste Issue: Molotov Takes the Opportunity to Elaborate, Reveals the True Face of Soviet Diplomacy, and Ironically Suggests That the British Political System is Outdated</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th] The startling speech delivered by US Secretary of Commerce Wallace in New York a few days ago has caused a major international wave. As its final repercussions are subsiding, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today delivered a stimulating speech at the meeting of the Political and Territorial Committee on Italy, marking his first address since returning to Paris from Moscow. This has triggered a new shock in the political world, truly a case of one wave not yet settled before another rises. In his speech, Molotov took the opportunity to express his views on other more important issues, revealing to some extent the truth of Soviet diplomacy, something that the general public is eager to know. Contrasting the concepts of democracy between Britain and the Soviet Union, Molotov argued that the British concept of democracy is a legacy of the 19th century. While this concept may be a notch above autocratic politics in ordinary times and may have its value, it is now the 20th century and it is imperative to adopt a thoroughly modern democratic politics, such as that created by the Soviet Union. The Soviet system is not only applicable to the Soviet Union itself but can also be implemented in other countries, with Bulgaria being one example. Molotov criticized the British political system, touching upon its colonial rule, saying that the British proposal for the future status of Trieste is no different from what it implements in its colonies. In short, both Wallace's speech and Molotov's speech have extremely broad implications, making it impossible for the countries concerned not to pay close attention to them.</p>
<p>Trieste Should Be Jointly Managed by the Four Powers, and a Democratic Autonomous Government Should Be Established</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] The Political and Territorial Committee on Italy of the Peace Conference held a meeting this afternoon, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech on the Trieste issue, lasting an hour. His general idea was that the Council of Foreign Ministers failed to find a solution to the Trieste issue, leaving the Political and Territorial Committee on Italy to face four different proposals to this day, at a loss. As for the Soviet plan, because it advocates granting Trieste a democratic status so that Trieste's interests are protected, it is better able to express the basic principles agreed upon by the Four Powers than any other plan. The so-called basic principles can be divided into two points: (1) The United Nations Security Council should appoint an administrator; (2) Legislative and administrative powers should be exercised in accordance with democratic principles. I believe that the three proposals put forward by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France all use the excuse that the people of Trieste do not yet have the ability to exercise their own sovereignty and entrust all powers to the administrator, which is difficult to accept. Based on this reason, the British plan entrusts all power to the administrator, which is no different from what it does in India and West Africa. But we should be clear that what is suitable for India and West Africa is not suitable for Trieste. On the contrary, the Soviet democratic system, no matter where it is applied, can prove its effectiveness, as Bulgaria is one example.</p>
<p>All Foreign Troops Must Withdraw Within 30 Days of the Treaty Taking Effect</p>
<p>A government of the people, by the people, for the people is the cornerstone of the Soviet plan, which is to give legislative and administrative powers to the People's Congress elected by universal suffrage. The Allied Commission, composed of representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, will have the task of preparing for elections within three months, fundamentally eliminating the remnants of Italian fascism. All foreign troops should withdraw from Trieste within 30 days of the signing of the peace treaty with Italy, and even the United Nations Security Council should not station troops there, because stationing troops would make Trieste a military base. As for the proposal put forward by the Australian representative, which advocates establishing a special council to replace the Security Council to handle all affairs in Trieste, this proposal is inappropriate. Its real purpose is to oppose the exercise of the veto power by the Four Powers. The international organization intends to create world peace and security and create this veto power, which is the first time in history, but the Australian representative is confused by the past and wants to go back in time to the era when there was no veto power. What was the old League of Nations in reality? It was a tool for the British and French groups to rule Europe. What was the result? The Munich Conference and the war. The Munich Conference was a compromise between the British and French groups and the aggressors at the expense of democratic countries. At present, if there is no veto power system, we will inevitably promote the division of the world into two spheres of influence, and the result will be another war and human catastrophe. If we abandon the Five Powers or abandon the Soviet Union and want to create world peace, this attempt will fail. Our views may sometimes be divided, but we should also seek agreement at any cost.</p>
<h3>When Will the Disputes at the Peace Conference End? The Difficulties of the Greek-Bulgarian Border Issue Are Increasing, Threatening to Catch Up with the Trieste Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Although the Paris Peace Conference has set a deadline for its conclusion, it is still affected by external events. Recent events such as the speech by US Secretary of Commerce Wallace, who advocated dealing with US-Soviet relations in a more peaceful way, is contrary to the hard-line anti-Soviet policy of the US delegation led by Byrnes at the Peace Conference. As a result, the situation at the Peace Conference will inevitably become more complex. It is generally believed that Wallace's speech, without President Truman's approval, will not be taken seriously, but there has been no indication of a change in US policy within the Peace Conference. As for the events within the Peace Conference, the difficulties in the Greek-Bulgarian border issue discussed by the Bulgarian Political and Territorial Committee are increasing, threatening to catch up with the Trieste issue. The latter, in addition to national consciousness, also has the issue of an outlet to the sea for the Eastern European group.</p>
<p>Italian-Austrian Dispute Negotiations Outside the Conference</p>
<p>Soviet representatives in the committee this week have frankly admitted that without resolving major issues of power politics, progress in other areas will be in vain. Due to the ease with which negotiations within the conference are constrained, negotiations outside the conference have also emerged, such as the agreement between Italy and Austria on South Tyrol.</p>
<p>Italian Reparations Issue Under Review</p>
<p>The reparations group of the Italian Economic Committee has begun to review the reparations claims of 13 countries. Italy has stated that it can bear at most 50 million to 75 million pounds in reparations, of which 25 million has already been agreed to be paid to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the subcommittee should seek a balance between the demands of various countries and the amount that Italy can bear to decide. It is also learned that the Dominican Republic was also included in the list of countries demanding reparations from Italy today.</p>
<h3>General Feng Yuxiang Arrives in San Francisco; Eight Hundred Chinese Passengers on the Same Ship</h3>
<p>[United Press San Francisco, 15th] The General Meigs arrived here today with 1,500 passengers, including about 800 Chinese passengers, mostly students, coming to study in schools in New York, Chicago, Boston, and other places in the United States. General Feng Yuxiang also arrived on the ship, leading a delegation of six members sent by the Chinese government to the United States to study water conservancy.

<h3>British and American Troops Search for Hidden German Treasure Worth an Estimated $270 Million</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 14th] Based on recently obtained clues, British and American detective teams mobilized 3,000 people starting from the 10th of this month to search German banks, factories, private residences, and shops, seeking German treasure hidden and valued at US$270 million. Thirty-five Germans have been arrested in the British occupation zone, and more arrests will follow. In the American occupation zone, precious metals and diamonds worth $35 million have been discovered, and the amount in the British occupation zone is expected to be even higher. According to an official announcement yesterday, the total value of hidden treasures discovered in the two occupation zones has reached $150 million.</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy Commission; Our Turn as Chairman; The Commission's Work Enters a New Phase</h3>

Xia also said that China is interested in atomic energy because of its "potential to benefit humanity."</p>
<h3>De Gaulle Alliance's Power Gradually Expands, Criticizing the French Constituent Assembly as Undemocratic</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Paris, 14th Special Dispatch] Various comrades of the French Liberation Movement, in support of De Gaulle's foundation for the French constitution announced in Bayeux, France, have formed the De Gaulle Alliance, which is now gradually expanding its power, with 500,000 people already signing up to join the new alliance. In addition, representatives of other parties, except the Communist Party, have also publicly or secretly expressed their contact with the new alliance. The De Gaulle Alliance has consistently criticized the Constituent Assembly as undemocratic and as a united dictatorship of various factions. If the alliance cannot gain the support of other forces, it will launch a massive propaganda campaign to have the constitution drawn up by the Constituent Assembly rejected in the citizen referendum held in October. The alliance firmly tells the Popular Republican Movement that it should agree with De Gaulle's proposed new constitutional foundation, which emphasizes executive power and places the president as the arbitrator above all parties.</p>

<h3>U.S. Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged; Truman Issues Statement; Only Approves Wallace's Right to Speak; Republican Party Seizes the Opportunity to Criticize the Government</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 14th] President Truman received reporters today and announced that he had withdrawn his approval of Commerce Secretary Wallace's speech. The President stated that what he approved was Wallace's right to speak. President Truman had previously said when approving Wallace's speech that he saw no difference between Byrnes's policy and Wallace's policy. However, today, President Truman stated that his approval of that speech did not mean that he wanted the speech to be a statement of our country's foreign policy. "My reply at the press conference on Thursday has caused misunderstandings. My reply was made casually, and it failed to express my original intention. My original intention was to approve Secretary of Commerce Wallace's right to make a speech, and not to approve his speech as a statement of our country's foreign policy. Our established foreign policy remains unchanged. There will be no major changes in foreign policy until the President, the Secretary of State, and members of Congress have discussed it."</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 14th] It was learned here today that U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and his two Senate advisors have forced President Truman to deny that he had previously approved Commerce Secretary Wallace's speech as a statement of U.S. foreign policy. Since Wallace's speech caused an uproar internationally, Byrnes and the President have not spoken by long distance, but it is known that Senators Connally and Vandenberg have spoken with Truman, saying a great deal. Vandenberg warned Truman that in such circumstances, the President's foreign policy could not reliably maintain bipartisan support, and told the President that he should choose one person between Wallace and Byrnes to be the spokesperson for foreign policy. Connally called for domestic unity in support of Byrnes, indirectly accusing Wallace of having political ambitions.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 14th] Acting Secretary of State Clayton discussed U.S. foreign policy and the relationship with Truman today in Washington. Clayton reported to reporters that he did not directly discuss Wallace's speech, but only discussed the topic of peace. Clayton's visit to the President was not announced beforehand, and Clayton said afterward that any statements on this matter would be issued by President Truman. Clayton also said that he had not spoken with Byrnes since Wallace gave his speech.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Jefferson City, USA, 14th] Republican National Committee Chairman Reece gave a speech here today, criticizing the Truman administration, stating that the Democratic Party is now controlled by a few leaders who are directing the party's policies, and that these people are only concerned with foreign ideas and are not very concerned about maintaining the form of our own government.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 14th] Republican Campaign Committee Chairman Brown issued a statement today calling for the resignation of Commerce Secretary Wallace. He said: "It is unpleasant for two members of Truman's cabinet to express contradictory opinions on such important issues. This situation is both a disgrace to the country and a crisis for the country."</p>
<h3>Wallace's Political Views Receive Labor Support; An Unsafe Searchlight; Reviewing U.S. Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 14th] Observers here believe that if American labor rises to support Commerce Secretary Wallace's speech on Thursday, Wallace's position will be greatly strengthened. Democratic leaders have remained silent about the speech so far, but Republican National Committee publicist Brown said that Wallace's sudden speech at a time when the U.S. government is trying to win over radicals clearly intends to allow the government to adopt it. Others say that Wallace's speech is in preparation for running for Vice President in 1948, intending to promote the unity of left-wingers before the congressional elections this fall. It is also said that Wallace, with the support of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, intends to follow in Roosevelt's footsteps and establish an understanding with the Soviet Union. It is generally believed here that Wallace's speech was a carefully considered one, and that President Truman's approval was intended to maintain a balance between the opposing opinions of Byrnes and Wallace before the congressional elections.</p>
<p>[United Press Miami, Florida, 14th] Senator Pepper, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared today that Commerce Secretary Gruenwald's speech in New York was tantamount to examining American foreign policy with a security searchlight, and that it contributed greatly to peace. Wallace's claims are very close to the public opinion of the American people. From my point of view, the policies pursued by the State Department are not sufficient to represent public opinion. Ninety-five percent of the resentment towards the Soviet Union is "empty propaganda" from reactionaries and imperialists.</p>

<h3>Newly Discovered Old Historical Facts; One: German-Soviet-Italian-Spanish Alliance; Two: Nazis Launched Germ Warfare</h3>
<p>— ——Written by United Press Lander——</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department recently released a type of obtained German secret document, which is a record of the talks between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. According to it, Mussolini suggested in 1941 that Hitler organize a "European Joint Front" with Germany, Italy, Spain, and the Soviet Union as its backbone to defeat Britain. The two leaders of the Axis powers unanimously believed that the Axis powers should try in every way to persuade France to declare war on Britain together. When assessing the hope of winning the war, Lee assured Mussolini that the so-called rearmament of the United States was really a "historical exaggeration."</p>
<p>The document specified that the main purpose of this meeting was to discuss the relationship between the Axis powers and Darlan, the then French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, the Hess incident, and the preparations for the next meeting between the two giants, Hitler and Mussolini. This matter occurred only a few months before Hitler decided to abandon a full-scale offensive against Britain and instead attack the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>According to the document, Ribbentrop told Mussolini: "The Führer believes that we must strive for final victory no matter what. In order to achieve this goal, he is willing to take the biggest step towards France." Lee continued: "The French question is being handled according to this principle. To what extent Darlan is willing to cooperate can be known at this moment. But concessions to France should be exchanged for France's help in the war against Britain."</p>
<p>Mussolini's answer was "France can contribute many small but extremely important assists to the Axis powers." He emphasized: "When the Axis powers are victorious, France often gets closer to the Axis powers. But when the situation is not good, she turns to Britain and the United States for flirtation."</p>
<p>The document continued: A German Foreign Minister expressed his agreement, saying: If France can be drawn into the Axis powers organization, it will definitely make a deep impression on the United States. Mussolini agreed with the German Foreign Minister's opinion, citing Hitler's strategy of uniting all of Europe against Britain. Only the Soviet Union and Spain have not yet joined this united front. The then Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer had declared that Spain would implement participation in the war after the harvest season this year. But this point in him is extremely doubtful. The German Foreign Minister said. Unfortunately, at the beginning of this year (1941), France and Langcol did not agree with the Axis powers. If France had joined the Axis powers at that time, the Strait of Gibraltar would have been seized from the British long ago, and the Spanish could have obtained more food, instead of begging for alms from Britain and the United States without getting anything. At this time, Mussolini mentioned again the European United Front against Britain and the two countries that had not yet joined the front, Spain and the Soviet Union. He repeatedly declared that if the policy of cooperation with the Soviet Union could be realized as desired, it would, in his opinion, be beneficial to the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Later, the three people's topic turned to the United States. Ribbentrop ridiculed the American rearmament plan as "the greatest exaggeration in history." Mussolini seemed to agree with the suggestion that "internal divisions have already occurred within the United States," and cited the speeches of former U.S. President Hoover and Colonel Lindbergh as representative arguments against the anti-Axis policies of the late President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>The work of interrogating German criminals in Nuremberg is about to end, and the crimes of the defendants can be announced by the end of this month.</p>
<p>It seems that the heinous crimes committed by the Hitler Party against humanity have been described in detail, but in addition to atrocities such as burning people alive, a reporter from the Truth Daily recently reported on the latest crimes of the Nazi bandits. This article, entitled "The Last Secret of Fascism," is about the latest discovered crimes of the Hitler Party members. Let us now let the facts speak for themselves and let us hear the confession of the Director of Medicine and Bacteriological Expert of the German High Command, Schlieber.</p>
<p>According to this Schlieber, "After the German army was defeated in Stalingrad, a secret meeting was held in Berlin. At this meeting, the representative of the German General Staff announced Hitler's order to engage in germ warfare."</p>
<p>Schlieber participated in the meeting as an expert and was asked to present a conclusion. At the same time, Göring was responsible for establishing a bacterial warfare committee. This happened in July 1943.</p>
<p>This preparation was carried out at a crazy speed. Professor Balmi established a special college that was moved from Germany to Posen in Poland to carry it out; there, Nazi murderers cultivated bacteria and conducted experiments on humans.</p>
<p>Everything was prepared to attack humanity with this vicious weapon, but this last trump card of the Nazis was broken by the Red Army. The Soviet army occupied Posen with a lightning-like attack, so this bacterial manufacturing base also fell into the hands of the Red Army. Although Hitler's bandits tried to blow it up and destroy the traces, it was too late.</p>
<p>However, the German High Command did not give up because of this. They moved the germ warfare manufacturing facility to Sassnitzburg in order to complete this work that harms the entire human race. But because of the rapid advance of the Red Army, the Nazis' plan failed again this time.</p>
<p>The Red Army began to attack Berlin, and the fascist rats fled the sinking Hitler ship, attempting to save their hides; German administration fell into a standstill, and the germ warfare was therefore not realized. The heroic Red Army broke Hitler's most vicious last chess piece. This Nazi plan threatened the entire human race. Germ warfare, when mentioned, makes one shudder.</p>
<p>The Red Army discovered the Nazis' last secret and saved the human race.</p>

<h3>The Senate Convened a Plenary Review Meeting Yesterday: Meticulously Examining and Calculating the Municipal Government's Budget; The Mayor Explained that Streamlining Expenses Has Reached the Highest Limit, and the People's Burden is Lighter Than Before the War</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to ensure prudence and thoroughness in the review of the Municipal Government's budget for the second half of the year, the Senate specially convened a plenary review meeting yesterday morning for a preliminary review of the principles.</p>
<p>The meeting began at 9:20 AM. First, the Mayor reported on the budget preparation process. Then, Xu Yongzuo, convener of the Ninth Review Group, and Li Wenjie, both CPAs, successively reported on the proceedings of the two group meetings and their personal opinions on the budget review. After a ten-minute break at 11:00 AM, the senators expressed their views one after another with great enthusiasm and actively participated in the discussion. In between, Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, provided supplementary explanations regarding requests for subsidies from the Central Government and the imposition of additional house taxes. The meeting was extended to 12:30 PM but still could not be concluded. The Speaker announced that due to time constraints, the meeting would be adjourned first, and senators who had not yet spoken could continue to express their views at the third meeting of the Ninth Review Group in the afternoon. The Speaker summarized the various opinions expressed in the morning, and the resulting principles were: first, to review whether all construction projects are truly necessary and whether administrative management expenses can be further reduced to achieve streamlining; if there is indeed a shortfall, then to further discuss ways to increase revenue.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the third meeting of the Ninth Review Group was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The Bureaus of Public Works, Land Administration, and Finance reported on the uses of the budget. Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, specifically pointed out that the percentage of administrative expenses of the Municipal Government and the concession in 1936 was much higher than today, while the percentage of construction expenses today is more than double that of that time. This, he said, is sufficient to show the Municipal Government's emphasis on construction.</p>
<p>The Mayor reported on the budget preparation process, stating first that due to the limited time and having just taken office, he was not yet familiar with the situation in the city, so the budget preparation was indeed not entirely satisfactory. He then explained the budget format and preparation guidelines separately, stating: (1) The senators believe that the budget format is too simple and resembles a castle in the air. However, there are practical difficulties because government agencies are different from commercial organizations, and administrative expenses and core business expenses are not easy to distinguish, and there are no regulations for such distinction in the central government's common practice. As for the work plan on which the budget is based, although it can be roughly seen in the budget, it is indeed not detailed enough. To remedy this, the number of existing personnel in the Municipal Government's establishment and the work plan for this year are being printed separately for reference. (2) Preparation guidelines: 1. In terms of streamlining expenses, I personally believe that it has been implemented to the highest limit. Before the war, the three institutions of the Municipal Government, the Public Works Bureau, and the French Municipal Council had a total of more than 5,000 employees. During Mayor Qian's tenure, there were also more than 3,500 employees. Now it has been reduced to more than 2,900 employees. Therefore, in terms of management fees, it is only more than half of what it was before the war. If further reductions are insisted upon, please consider the practical difficulties and provide "flexible" regulations. 2. This time, the budget is prepared neither based on income nor based on expenditure. If it were based on expenditure, the flood control project alone would require more than 10 billion yuan, and the construction of roads and bridges would also require 10 billion to 20 billion yuan, which is practically impossible. Therefore, the existing budget is prepared by seeking austerity on the one hand and construction on the other under the current social and economic conditions, calculating the minimum maintenance costs and the minimum business expenses. Before the war, the total annual expenditure of the three administrative institutions was more than 50 million yuan, which, calculated at 5,000 times the currency value, amounts to more than 270 billion yuan today, half of which is more than 130 billion yuan, which is more than the current semi-annual budget of more than 80 billion yuan. Furthermore, in terms of the people's burden, before the war, it was about 15 to 16 yuan per person per year. Now, based on a population of 4 million, calculated for half a year, it is about 20,000 yuan per person, and the whole year is 40,000 yuan, which, calculated at 5,000 times, is only equivalent to 8 yuan before the war.</p>
<p>The Mayor further emphasized that the Senate is the highest decision-making body of the municipality and can control financial power by passing budgets and final accounts. The success or failure of municipal administration largely depends on the decision-making body. Therefore, the current budget should be reviewed rationally and should not be based entirely on reducing the people's burden. "Otherwise," the Mayor concluded his report with a smiling tone, "nothing needs to be done."</p>
<h3>House Tax and Municipal Tax: There Seems to Be Overlap; Report of Opinions from Xu Yongzuo, Convener of the Ninth Group</h3>
<p>Xu Yongzuo, CPA, one of the conveners of the Ninth Group Review Committee, reported on the proceedings of the two meetings of the Group and the Third Subcommittee, and then expressed his personal opinions: (1) Analyzing the figures, the total semi-annual budget of 84.7 billion yuan, calculated based on a population of 4 million, averages 21,000 yuan per person for half a year. Compared with the national total budget of 2,524.9 billion yuan for this year, it accounts for about 6.7% for half a year. (2) Regarding the comparison of expenses with the three administrative institutions before the war, the total expenditure of the three administrative institutions in 1936 was more than 47 million yuan, which, calculated at 5,000 times, amounts to more than 110 billion yuan today for half a year, which seems to be more than the current budget of 84.7 billion yuan. However, upon detailed analysis, more than 52% of the current budget is for staff salaries and living allowances, which, calculated according to the central government's regulations, is only equivalent to 1,500 times that of before the war. Therefore, if 52% is converted at 1,500 times, the semi-annual expenses of the three administrative institutions before the war are equivalent to about 77 billion yuan today, and a portion of this is debt expenditure that must be excluded from the calculation. Furthermore, the salaries of foreign employees before the war were particularly high and cannot be compared with those of current civil servants. Therefore, the actual calculation shows that the semi-annual expenditure of the three administrative institutions before the war is only equivalent to 72 billion yuan today. (3) The largest part of the expenditure in the budget is salaries and living allowances, accounting for more than 52%. It is best to analyze which belongs to administrative expenses and which belongs to business expenses. Judging from the classification table currently printed by the Municipal Government, the number of tenured personnel seems to be too large. (4) The current state of financial revenue is still unreasonable. Housing tax should be implemented as soon as possible, such as the registered land value tax and the house tax in the Nanshi Zhabei cross-border area. In addition, attention can be paid to the beneficiary fees for public utilities and private license fees. At a time when people's livelihoods are declining, large-scale municipal administration cannot rely entirely on donations and taxes. My personal opinion is that funds can be raised through borrowing. (5) Among the five methods submitted by the Municipal Government to make up for the shortfall in revenue and expenditure, the house tax and municipal tax seem to overlap. Furthermore, the increase in house tax is too large and exceeds the rent, which is obviously in conflict with central government laws and regulations.</p>
<h3>Senators Express Opinions: Are All the Construction Projects in the Plan Necessary? Can Administrative Expenses Be Further Reduced?</h3>
<p>The senators expressed their opinions on the Municipal Government's budget. The first to step up to the microphone was Lu Shidao. He said, "To review the budget, we must first consider several major premises: (1) The Municipal Government is not a profit-making organization. It cannot do anything without money. (2) If we give money, how much do we give? (3) Where does the money we give come from? (4) What will be the result after we give the money? Can the citizens afford it? I believe that the current Municipal Government is full of vigor. If we don't pass the budget, it will not be able to do anything. We represent the people. We only ask whether things are right or wrong, regardless of whether people scold us or not. Therefore, I advocate several principles: (1) Distinguish clearly between the construction projects that the Municipal Government wants to undertake. Which things should not be done, and which things should be done. For the things that need to be done, we will give the Municipal Government as much money as it needs. (2) As for the source of the money, the citizens will always have to add a little to their burden, but we should not create too many items. We can focus on one or two donations and taxes that people can afford. (3) The Municipal Government should mind its own business less and shift the passive regulatory fees to active construction fees."</p>
<p>Fu Rulin left the meeting early due to business. He wrote down several points of opinion in advance and asked Lu Shidao to express them on his behalf: (1) He believes that the budget of 84.7 billion yuan should be approved in full. (2) The central government has clear regulations on the allocation of business fees and administrative fees. (3) The projects that need to be done can be done in stages. (4) The shortage of funds can be subsidized by requesting assistance from the central government.</p>
<p>Zhan Wen then said: "First, the Senate, considering its own position, adheres to the principle that the laws and regulations we pass do not conflict with central government laws and regulations. Among the five methods for increasing tax revenue submitted by the Municipal Government, the municipal donation, cleaning donation, and public utility surcharge have no legal basis. The house tax item, if it exceeds the rent, also conflicts with central government laws and regulations and gives landlords an excuse to increase rents. As for the issue of opening up the racecourse, the Mayor said that the income from racing can recover the racecourse within two years, but if we calculate the monthly income at 400 million yuan, it will only be 9.6 billion yuan in two years, while the racecourse alone is worth more than 300 billion yuan in land value. How can we recover it? As for foreigners wanting to build houses at the racecourse, the Public Works Bureau has the right to stop them, which is not a reason to open up racing. Therefore, I advocate that the missing 20 billion yuan in construction fees can be levied separately under the house tax item."</p>
<h3>The Central Government Takes a Lot of Money Away: It Should Return Some</h3>
<p>Tao Baichuan supplemented the opinion raised by Fu Rulin about requesting assistance from the central government. He said, "The central government has taken a lot of money from Shanghai. It should return some. The Mayor doesn't have to be polite!"</p>
<p>Ji believes that the number of Municipal Government personnel can still be reduced, especially in the Secretariat and the Land Administration Bureau. Not only are there too many staff members, but there are also too many public servants. As for the five tax increase methods submitted by the Mayor, they are all clever creations, which Sichuan people call "unacceptable!" However, he believes that horse racing can be regarded as a sport, but it should be held in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Xu Jiyun also expressed his opinion. He said, "We should not be afraid when we see the word 'billion'. A clever housewife cannot cook without rice. We must assist the Municipal Government."</p>
<p>Director Gu provided supplementary explanations regarding requesting assistance from the central government and the house tax. Then, Tong Hangbai stepped up and expressed his opinion, saying, "On the revenue side, we should seek a fundamental solution from the land value tax and implement the land policy of the Three Principles of the People. On the expenditure side, there must be a certain ratio between business fees and administrative fees. Administrative efficiency does not depend on having a large number of people."</p>
<p>Wang Zhuyi's opinion is more in line with the "principle" of review. He believes that the first thing to do in reviewing the budget is to broaden the scope, the second is to assess the work, and the third is that the senators must take responsibility and not be afraid of external attacks. He said, "It is impossible to 'want the horse to run fast but not want it to eat grass.' " In addition, he also advocates requesting assistance from the central government.</p>
<h3>Construction Aims to Benefit the People: Increasing the Burden Harms the People</h3>
<p>Fei Shusheng loudly called for a reduction to below 60 billion yuan. He said that the purpose of construction is to benefit the people, but now we must first increase the burden, which harms the people instead. Moreover, the budget has increased four times, and other prices are bound to be affected and increase. How can we cope with this cycle? Therefore, he advocates not doing things that are not necessary and saving as much as possible on things that need to be done.</p>
<p>The time has been extended to 12:30 PM, and there are still many slips of paper on the chairman's platform requesting to speak. The speaker stood up and said, "All the opinions can be summarized into two principles: First, we should first review whether all the construction projects in the plan are necessary. Second, can the expenses in administrative management be further reduced? If it is still not enough, then we will study ways to increase revenue. Senators who do not have time to speak can express their opinions at the meeting of the Ninth Review Group in the afternoon."</p>
<p>[Another report] The reporter talked with Senator Wang Wei yesterday about the comparison between the house tax and the municipal tax in the cases submitted by the Mayor. According to the discussion, both have their advantages and disadvantages, but the house tax has more advantages. Furthermore, the new method limits the amount of tax borne by the landlord to only 20% of the actual rent. If the rent is increased, the amount of tax borne will also increase proportionally, so it can have the effect of adjusting with the rent. Furthermore, the collection data are all readily available, and only the standard needs to be determined, which is relatively simple and easy to implement. The annual income can be 6 billion yuan more than the municipal tax.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter to the Senate: Please Forward Eight Suggestions</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Senate yesterday, requesting that the eight suggestions for saving the industrial and commercial crisis be submitted to the central government and implemented quickly. The spokesperson of the Chamber of Commerce also made a statement, stating the circumstances of the suspension of loans by the Shanghai Branch of the Four Joint Offices.</p>
<h3>The Third Review Meeting of the Ninth Group: Listening to the Explanations of the Budget from the Bureaus of Public Works, Land Administration, and Finance</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Ninth Subcommittee responsible for reviewing the Municipal Government's budget held its third review meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 PM yesterday, listening to the explanations of the budget from the Bureaus of Public Works, Land Administration, and Finance. Xu Yongzuo served as the chairman, and more than a dozen senators attended, as well as Zhao Zukang, Zhu Ping, and Gu Chunfan, the three directors, and the accounting directors of each bureau. Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu also attended the meeting one after another. First, Senator Chu Shun spoke, dividing the budgets for education, culture, construction, and health into necessary, secondary, and again secondary, assessing the urgency and reducing them, based on the principle of not conflicting with central government laws and regulations. He also suggested separately levying a municipal construction donation, dedicated to municipal construction, and hoped that the Municipal Government would run more productive enterprises to subsidize municipal expenditures. At the same time, he advocated requesting assistance from the central government.</p>
<p>Then, Senator Zhu Wende requested that the various bureaus provide more review materials for reference during the review. Regarding tax revenue, Senator Zhu's opinions were: (1) Oppose the progressive house tax system. The house tax in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts should be resumed immediately. (2) Increasing the land value tax can stimulate rent. (3) Cotton is the main crop planted in the fields of this city, so it is unfair to convert the land tax at the price of grain. Senator Zhu believes that it is most appropriate to request assistance from the central government for the financial difficulties of this city. Senator Li Wenjie specifically proposed a method for disposing of the Municipal Government's public land, increasing the land value for purchasers of land during the enemy and puppet period, and transferring the proceeds to the funding for land right consolidation. He also expressed that the Senate is not simply reducing the budget for each bureau. If it is indeed necessary, it can also be increased. Afterwards, the chairman asked Director Zhao of the Bureau of Public Works to explain first. Director Zhao said: The budget of this bureau is generally divided into (1) Regular administrative expenses - including road worker wages. (2) Regular business expenses - including eight major tasks such as roads, bridges, ditches, and houses. (3) Temporary business expenses - which are more flexible. The bureau has three principles for using personnel: less internal and more external, less work and more skills, and fewer positions and more workers. That is, more field staff than internal affairs, more technical personnel than administrative personnel, and more workers than employees. In terms of staffing, attention is paid to the malpractices that occur during contracting and purchasing materials, and a check-and-balance system is adopted. The three powers of material procurement, material allocation, and material use are separated. The temporary budget of 12.1 billion yuan for the second half of the year is higher than the 7.7 billion yuan for the first half of the year. Although the nominal figures have increased, the prices and wages in the second half of the year are much higher than in the first half of the year, so it has not actually increased. The average price of building materials has increased 10,000 times compared with before the war. Director Zhao specifically proposed building a north-south avenue through Xizang Road, Song Park Road, and Manufacturing Bureau Road to average the future development of this city. Next, Director Zhu Ping of the Land Administration Bureau explained that the collection of 3 billion yuan in land value tax is not guaranteed before the land is completely consolidated, and explained the distribution of the estimated 3.1 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Gu Chunfan Explains Difficulties: House Tax is a Central Government Regulation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Director Gu Chunfan of the Finance Bureau explained the difficulties in adjusting tax revenue at the plenary budget review meeting yesterday morning, saying: I am more concerned about the budget and finances than everyone else. It is not easy to obtain allocations from the central government at present, because the central government has allocated a part of it last year and in the first half of this year, but since the central government convened a meeting on the financial revenue and expenditure system in July, it has clearly stipulated what should be allocated to local governments. At the same time, local municipal administration and business construction cannot be interrupted for a day. If we have to ask the central government every time, it is practically impossible. Even if the central government approves the allocation, work will be suspended during the application period.</p>
<p>In addition, someone proposed levying a gasoline tax, but the gasoline tax is a commodity tax and should belong to the central government, not the local government. An application was submitted to the central government to allocate the dockage fee in the first half of the year, but it was not approved, and it has now been submitted again. The suggestion to increase the vehicle license tax is indeed acceptable, but there is no guarantee at the moment. The land value tax has already been included in the budget. The house tax is a central government regulation and must be levied. The municipal donation is a special donation of the local government and is determined by the local government. Increasing the house tax does not necessarily affect the rent. Whether the rent needs to be changed is still up to the Senate to decide. The house tax is levied at 20% of the actual rent.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Budget Compared with Before the War: Construction Expenses Have Increased Significantly; Gu Chunfan Reports at the Review Meeting</h3>
<p>Finally, Gu Chunfan of the Finance Bureau reported on the budget for various taxes, saying: The land tax is levied at 9.2 dou of grain per mu, equivalent to 4.6 dou of rice. If converted according to the current price of rice, it is as high as more than 34,000 yuan, while it was only 1 yuan before the war. Therefore, the Finance Bureau believes it is too high and has requested the Ministry of Food to reduce it, based on the principle of not exceeding the multiple of prices. The collection method will also be innovated on a trial basis, without using the old method of local security. The original budget for the house tax was 2.7 billion yuan. The level standards and collection methods will be decided by the general assembly. Of the 890 million yuan in expenditures of the Finance Bureau, the cost of printing tickets and documents is 450 million yuan, accounting for half of the total. Director Gu also announced the increase or decrease in the percentage of the total expenditure of the Municipal Government and the two concessions in 1936 compared with the current Municipal Government's various budgets: (1) Police and public security fees have decreased from 30% to 27%. (2) Administrative fees have decreased from 16.87% to 4%. (3) Construction fees have increased from 16% to 30%. (4) Cultural and educational fees have increased from 9.4% to 13.5%. (5) Health fees have increased from 5.2% to 10.8%. The increase in the various budgets for the second half of the year compared with the first half of the year: (1) The Bureau of Public Works actually spent 5.162 billion yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 17.996 billion yuan, an increase of 12.834 billion yuan. (2) The Police Bureau spent 4.634 billion yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 17.728 billion yuan, an actual increase of 13.094 billion yuan. (3) The Education Bureau spent 2.729 billion yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 16.239 billion yuan, an actual increase of 13.51 billion yuan. (4) The Health Bureau spent 2.178 billion yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 13.612 billion yuan, an actual increase of 11.434 billion yuan. (5) The Public Utilities Bureau spent 910 million yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 4.356 billion yuan, an actual increase of 3.446 billion yuan. (6) The Land Administration Bureau spent 751 million yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 3.131 billion yuan, an actual increase of 2.38 billion yuan. (7) The Civil Affairs Office spent 1.146 billion yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 2.976 billion yuan, an actual increase of 1.83 billion yuan. (8) The Finance Bureau spent 608 million yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 2.349 billion yuan, an actual increase of 1.741 billion yuan. (9) The Secretariat of the Municipal Government spent 815 million yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 1.751 billion yuan, an actual increase of 936 million yuan. (10) The Social Affairs Bureau spent 308 million yuan in the first half of the year, and the budget for the second half of the year is 1.319 billion yuan, an actual increase of 1.011 billion yuan. After Director Gu's report, Li Wenjie, Zhu Fuqiu, and others raised questions, and the three directors gave answers, mostly related to land administration. Finally, Speaker Pan gave the review team two instructions: (1) Reduce the Municipal Government's budget as much as possible where it can be reduced, and increase it where it is necessary to increase it. (2) Please prepare a preliminary plan and speed up the review work. Passing the Municipal Government's budget is one of the important tasks of the Senate. The review team will continue to meet today.</p>

<h3>Former Workers Disgruntled with Arbitration, Gather Crowd to Vandalize New Quan Pool</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A group of former workers from the New Quan Pool Bathhouse at 197-199 Fuxing Road Central, disgruntled with the arbitration terms of the Social Affairs Bureau, gathered a large group of over a hundred hooligans around six or seven o'clock last night. Without asking the reason, they rushed into the bathhouse, beating up more than ten people, including the accountant Cao Hongsan and new workers Jian Shiliang and Ma Deliang. They also smashed and damaged glass windows, desks, chairs, and other items. The relevant police station, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to surround and arrest them, apprehending several workers involved in the incident on the spot. The injured were sent to Nanyang Hospital by the police for treatment.</p>
<h3>Why Interfere with "Interpretone"? Xin Guang Theater Accuses Ticket Holder of Theft</h3>
<p>To facilitate the audience when showing Western films, major first-run movie theaters in the city are equipped with "Interpretone" devices. Yesterday afternoon around 2:50 PM, when the first showing of "Divine Eagle Wanli" at the Xin Guang Theater on Ningbo Road was about to begin, a ticket taker discovered that a spectator had taken the wrong seat. When the person who had the correct seat arrived and asked him to move, it was noticed that the guest's rented Interpretone was not on his ear but on his lap. Suspecting theft, the ticket taker reported it to the theater manager, who took the customer to the Lao Zha District Police Station. The person identified himself as Huang Juchen, 38 years old, from Pudong, a cotton cloth merchant. He claimed to have bought a ticket and entered the theater around 2:00 PM. To understand the plot, he rented an Interpretone from the theater, but found it was broken and made no sound after the show started. Because the theater was dark and half the show had already played, he didn't want to leave his seat to exchange it, so he placed the Interpretone on his lap. Unexpectedly, the theater accused him of being a thief. He also said that if he had taken the Interpretone out of the theater and was discovered, he could be suspected of theft, but since he was watching the show, even if the Interpretone worked, whether or not he listened was his own business. Furthermore, it was on his lap, not hidden in his pocket, so there was no question of him being a thief. The police station agreed that his explanation was reasonable and refused to accept the case. It is understood that Huang, because he was taken out of the theater before the end of the show without cause, has approached the theater for a refund of his ticket.</p>
<h3>Accountant Accused of Embezzlement, Released on Bail Due to Insufficient Evidence</h3>

Zhang currently resides in room 536 of the Erjing Hotel, and officers were dispatched to accompany him to the station for questioning. According to his statement, most of the 8,453,510,100 yuan in question was lent to the Da Zhonghua Film Company with the prior consent of Manager Hong Huimin, and only 2,560,000 yuan was used without authorization. The police station considered the evidence insufficient and ordered him to be released on bail to settle the matter out of court.</p>
<h3>Negligence in Dock Security, Entire Pieces of Fabric Stolen</h3>
<p>Recently, theft at the docks has been rampant. Although the authorities have dispatched police to patrol at all times, petty thieves are still very active. A cotton cloth merchant named Shou Taikang, residing at No. 9 Jingxing Lane, Tianjin, was loading a large quantity of fabric at Pier 56 on Waisuzhou Road around 11:00 AM yesterday. While the coolies were carrying the fabric onto the barge, it was suddenly discovered that one piece of bleached cloth, totaling 25 bolts, worth over 1.1 million yuan, was missing. It had been stolen by thieves taking advantage of the opportunity. He immediately reported the theft to the relevant Feipu District Police Station requesting an investigation.</p>

<h3>Too Few Animals in Shanghai, Wu Zhengwei Advocates Expanding the Zoo</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Councilor Wu Zhengwei, noting that zoos are valuable educational resources beneficial for children's knowledge and that Shanghai's only zoo has been destroyed and not restored, and expressing regret that a panda was sent on a special plane directly to London, has requested the Bureau of Public Works to expedite the collection or purchase of animals to enrich the existing zoo and add new ones. Wu stated that before August 13th, the city had two zoos, namely the Confucius Temple and the Zhaohe Park. After the Confucius Temple was affected by the war, the French Municipal Council, at the request of the local authorities, sent troops to move a pair of lions, a female tiger, a leopard, a black panther, a giant python, and a black bear, as well as four peacocks, to the French Park for refuge. Unfortunately, due to the climate, the giant python froze to death first, and the black bear, black panther, lions, and tigers successively died of lung disease. During that time, the French also purchased sharks, monkeys, and various other animals, which were later moved by the enemy forces to Zhaofeng Park. After the victory, due to poor management, most of the animals died from lack of sustenance.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Shanghai Municipal Government's Financial Budget and Revenue/Expenditure Totals for the First Half of the Year</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Councilor Li Wenjie, convener of the Ninth Group, reviewed the municipal government's budget and presented the following report comparing the financial budget and revenue/expenditure totals with the first half of the year:</p>
<p>Current rent, house tax, and examples of proposed increases in house tax by the Municipal Government:</p>
<p>Assuming a pre-war rent of 20 yuan, the current rent has increased 140 times, making it 2,800 yuan. The house tax, calculated at 14% of the pre-war rent, was 2.8 yuan, now increased 540 times, totaling 1,512 yuan, which the central government stipulates is to be borne by the landlord. The municipal government plans to increase the house tax rate to 20% in the future without changing the rent. The increase factor is graded into A, B, and C categories, with A being increased to 3,000 times, B to 2,000 times, and C to 1,000 times. For example, if calculated at the C level, a rent of 20 yuan would incur a house tax of 4,000 yuan, with the landlord paying 560 yuan and the tenant paying 3,440 yuan, to demonstrate adjustment.</p>
<p>According to Councilor Li's personal opinion, citizens should support the municipal government as much as possible for expenditures related to business development and should not advocate for reductions. However, administrative expenses should be reduced as much as possible to alleviate the burden on the people.</p>
<h3>Female Principal Detained for Allegedly Forging Seals and Official Stamps, Husband Li Boqing Released on Bail After Questioning</h3>
<p>Li Boqing, former district chief of the 16th District of this city, and his wife, Gao Palian (the current principal of Qinghua Elementary School), were suspected of forging seals, official stamps, and business cards around April of this year, and occupying two houses in the Nanhua New Village on Dixiwei Road, Yuxin Lane, and office space in the Hadong Building, were sued by the owners to the District Prosecutor's Office. They were summoned for questioning the other day. Li Boqing and his wife Gao Palian appeared in response to the summons. It was claimed that the forged seals were not used. Li Boqing was allowed to be released on bail in court, while Gao Palian was reportedly detained. (Hu Guang News Agency)</p>
<h3>Tidbits from the Conference Venue</h3>
<p>Everyone admires Mayor Wu's fluent oratory, but when explaining the budget preparation process yesterday, he used "second" too many times. After one "second," there was another "second," making it unclear how many points he was actually making.</p>
<p>The Mayor's punctuality is always commendable. The budget review meeting was scheduled to begin at 9:20 AM yesterday, but he arrived as early as five minutes before 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>The budget review and discussion inevitably involved numbers. A series of hundreds of millions, tens of thousands, how much increase, how much decrease, what percentage, how many times - those who spoke had to speak, and those who listened grew weary. Journalists especially felt the pain. However, don't underestimate these tedious numbers, as they will affect the changes in the income and expenditure of every family in Shanghai in the near future.</p>
<p>Lu Shidao wanted the Municipal Government to interfere less. He gave an example, saying that it would be better to run a legitimate entertainment venue than to catch gambling. Someone in the audience commented, "I think not catching them is more effective than an entertainment venue!"</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan issued another warning yesterday, saying, "The taxes in Shanghai now (referring to banquet taxes and entertainment taxes) are taken from the pockets of those who dance on volcanoes!"</p>
<p>When Ji Yun discussed the issue of opening the racetrack, he said, "Saying we'll take it back in two years is just fooling children!"</p>
<p>There is a vast difference in the speaking skills of the councilors. The excellent ones are engrossing and captivating. The lengthy and verbose ones are unpleasant to hear. Yesterday, a certain councilor recited his previously written speech against horse racing, and even when the allotted time was up, he refused to stop, prompting many councilors in the audience to applaud him down.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the newspapers sent out a lot of complimentary copies. There was a large pile on every table, but the reporters' seats were completely missing. The reporters had to "guerilla" everywhere, giving the feeling that "reporters are not as important as newspapers."</p>

<h3>Crisis in Chinese Tea Exports, Appeal for Swift and Effective Relief, Tea Associations Send Letters to the Municipal Council and Chamber of Commerce, Four Proposals Requesting Government Adoption</h3>
<p>The China Tea Industry Association, Shanghai Tea Export Association, Shanghai Tea Trade Commercial Guild, and other organizations, in order to call for saving the tea crisis, have sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Chamber of Commerce, putting forward four proposals requesting to be conveyed to the government. Their telegram stated: "Publicly to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Chamber of Commerce, tea is a special product of our country, with the same glorious history as silk. Since ancient times, it has been sold to Europe and the United States, not only related to the source of profit, but also representing Chinese culture and civilization, with a long-standing reputation in the world. Since the Anti-Japanese War, the rural areas have been devastated and transportation has been blocked. Not only have groups of tea disappeared from overseas markets, but also domestic sales have gradually decreased due to transportation obstruction. Now that victory has arrived, domestic production costs have increased sharply, and transportation conditions have still not improved much. Recently, the government revised the Goods Tax Regulations and included tea, imposing ad valorem tax. Upon hearing this, we are deeply apprehensive.</p>
<p>Levying Goods Tax, Suffering Actual Harm First</p>
<p>Considering that Chinese tea has always been exempt from consolidated tax and export tax, but the payment of business tax, income tax, stamp duty, etc., is already heavy. Moreover, due to rising domestic costs, international price limits have not been removed, and the price difference between domestic and foreign markets is becoming increasingly distant. The international tea market is very competitive. For example, the United Kingdom restricts the import quantity of Chinese tea, the United States restricts the price of Chinese tea, and the French government's import ban on Chinese tea has not been lifted, all of which are major obstacles to the future of Chinese tea exports. In addition, the impact of domestic prices makes it impossible to reduce costs. Even calculating based on the revised exchange rate, the actual benefit to tea exports is very small. Because before the exchange rate adjustment, the overseas tea price was only one-third of the domestic cost. After the adjustment, it is still less than half of the cost. Now the government is taking steps to abolish export taxes, encourage exports, and compete for international markets. Both at home and abroad are paying attention. How could we know that tea exports originally had no export tax, but when tea is in extreme difficulty, a new tea goods tax is suddenly levied? This results in not enjoying any illusory benefits and suffering actual harm first, further increasing the burden on tea farmers, industrialists, and merchants, and promoting the total collapse of the tea industry.</p>
<p>Tea Farmers Lack Funds, Chopping and Digging Up Tea Gardens</p>
<p>Our colleagues are concerned about the real difficulties of tea after the war, and in view of the importance of timely export of Chinese tea to compete for the market, as early as October last year, we formulated a plan, calling on the authorities to set a tea policy early, raise the necessary funds, and avoid missing the opportunity. However, after running around calling for help, it was not until early May that the Four Banks Joint Office allocated special funds, designating the China Farmers Bank to provide tea loans for relief. Although the China Farmers Bank authorities quickly planned and assisted in many ways, the amount of tea loans was still insufficient to meet the demand, resulting in tea merchants still having to turn to high-interest loans. Costs are increasing, and funds are lacking. To this day, they have not been able to refine the tea into boxes for export and sale. There is even less ability to purchase summer tea. Tea farmers in the producing areas lack funds for harvesting and processing, enduring the waste of goods on the ground, and further chopping and digging up tea gardens, destroying the life of the national tea that has been around for thousands of years. It is foreseeable that Chinese tea will be forever lost in the international market. Our association and colleagues, seeing the crisis and not allowing ourselves to sit idly by, have jointly elected representatives to go to Beijing to present the actual difficulties to the National Government and various ministries and commissions, requesting immediate and effective relief, but to this day, it has not been adopted and implemented. Now that the situation is becoming more urgent, we cannot wait. Our association and colleagues, while there is still a breath left, cannot bear that historical products will fall into ruin. We respectfully present the various points that our colleagues hope from the government as follows:</p>
<p>Grant Subsidies to Encourage Exports</p>
<p>(1) Grant export subsidies to encourage exports. Countries around the world often adopt an export subsidy system to expand or maintain the overseas market of a certain commodity in order to reward or subsidize merchants. For example, India is a British territory, and the government has also processed tea export subsidies because the overseas tea price is lower than the cost. If our government's measures are not as good as the Indian government's, how can we treat our people well at home and rank among the world's powers abroad? The reason why tea cannot be exported now is entirely due to the sales price difference formed by the cost and the officially set exchange rate. Therefore, the government should handle export subsidies to assist tea merchants. This subsidy can be adjusted by graded exchange rates or paid by the national treasury. If limited by the budget, it can be supplemented by adding import duties on ten kinds of items, such as luxury goods and non-essential goods, and then using the income to subsidize tea exports, which is the most rational and simplest incentive method.</p>
<p>Barter Tea for Materials</p>
<p>(2) Continue to barter tea for materials. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, the government bartered tea with the Soviet Union and stationed in the United States to support sales in North Africa, achieving considerable results. This barter method is most suitable for the Soviet Union, which controls international trade. In the past, when the government unified the purchase of foreign tea for export during the Anti-Japanese War, the foreign tea price was very high, and all the foreign exchange profits of the tea merchants were contributed to the government. At that time, in order to enhance the strength of the Anti-Japanese War, they were generous in their donations. Now, tea exports have stagnated, but the Soviet Union needs a large number of boxed tea. It is urgent to restore the barter with the Soviet Union to expand foreign sales. For example, French North Africa also needs a large number of Chinese tea. If we ask the French government to exchange it for Annam's rice and coal, or seek mutual exchange of cotton and tea with the Egyptian government. This kind of barter method can directly encourage the exchange of goods between the two countries, and indirectly increase the supply of rice and coal and stabilize domestic prices.</p>
<p>Economic Diplomacy to Expand Markets</p>
<p>(3) Use economic diplomacy to expand markets. There are currently some countries with customs regulations that are not conducive to Chinese tea, such as the United Kingdom restricting the import quantity of Chinese tea this year to 2.5 million pounds, which is only 20% of the amount of Chinese tea exported to the UK in 1937. The United States, on the other hand, restricts prices, so the price limit on Chinese tea is extremely low. Also, such as Casablanca, the center of the North African green tea market, which is the largest market for Chinese green tea, the French government has an order prohibiting the import of Chinese tea. It is proposed that the government negotiate with these countries through diplomatic channels to remove the above-mentioned restrictions in order to expand the Chinese tea market. In addition, such as Casablanca, the center of the African green tea market, there is no consulate, and tea merchants are greatly hindered in trade due to the lack of guidance and connection. We also request to increase the consulate as soon as possible to protect and facilitate promotion.</p>
<p>Reduce Costs to Promote Sales</p>
<p>(4) Exempt goods tax to reduce costs. From 1940 to 1941, the government once "tried to levy unified tea tax, but at that time, foreign tea was still under control, so it was limited to domestic tea. Later, because the domestic tea market was very narrow, the levy was cumbersome and detailed, and tea merchants could not bear the burden, so they were exempted from the unified tea tax. Now, the situation of domestic and foreign tea sales is more difficult than during the war, and the rural economy is becoming more bankrupt. The government is supporting it in many ways, fearing that it is too late. If we add tea tax, increase the burden, increase the cost, and make it hopeless to export, the domestic sales will be stagnant, which will only make tea farmers and merchants deeper in the water and hotter in the fire, with little benefit and no benefit to the country. Therefore, if we want to dredge tea sales, we must first reduce costs, and exempting tea goods tax is also to first show the purpose of advocating. We have always admired your council's representation of public opinion, safeguarding production, and long-standing enthusiasm. Therefore, we dare to present the actual situation, telegramly urge you to convey the truth to the government, and unanimously call for it to be adopted as soon as possible to save the tea industry crisis. We cannot suppress our expectation. Chairman of the China Tea Industry Association, Li Shoujingwei, Shanghai Tea Association Chairman Tang Jiyin, Shanghai Tea Trade Commercial Guild Chairman Huang Yantang, Shanghai Tea Industry Commercial Guild Chairman Zheng Jianyuan Qiantuo, Shen Xian."</p>

<h3>Minzhi Nation-Building Society, Another Hongmen Organization Established</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Hongmen has long been an organization with a long history in our country, but because all activities are not open to the public, the people of the country do not know much about its actual situation. Among the overseas Chinese in the United States, Hongmen brothers account for the vast majority. They strongly assisted the Father of the Nation during the Xinhai Revolution and actively donated during the Anti-Japanese War, and their position is naturally important. After the victory, overseas Chinese leaders Situ Meitang and Zhu Jiazhao returned to China together, wanting to make further practical efforts for national affairs. Shanghai then held the Hongmen Global Relatives Conference, and Situ Meitang and others had the intention of establishing the Zhi Gong Party, which they had established overseas two years earlier, in the country. They also met with the Chairman. Due to various reasons, it was renamed the Minzhi Party, and they invited reporters a month ago to formally announce its establishment. As for the political program, it focuses on economic development, state-owned enterprises, and safeguarding private enterprises. The main people in charge are Situ Meitang, Zhu Jiazhao, and Zhao Yu, claiming to have more than three million members.</p>
<p>However, yesterday morning, another Minzhi Nation-Building Society held a meeting at the Tianpo Stage. It is also a Hanmen organization, responsible persons are Liu Huimin, Cui Conglai, Lin Youmin, Xu Junwu, Liu Chengzi, Long Xiangsan, Ding Ziheng, Tang Mouwu, Jiang Shijiang, etc., claiming to have 70,000 members, with the principle of "obeying the Five Ancestor's legacy, promoting the national spirit, practicing the Three People's Principles, and completing nation-building and unification," and the purpose of "establishing life responsibilities, respecting people's interests, stabilizing social order, and protecting human freedom." The meeting also passed a telegram of respect to the Chairman.</p>
<h3>Béthouart to Fly to Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>General Béthouart, head of the French Military Advisory Group in Japan, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday on Marshal MacArthur's special plane and then transfer to Japan, but due to bad weather, it has been rescheduled to come here today (the 16th). He will land at Longhua Airport. The time of arrival at the airport is not yet known, but it is expected to be in the afternoon. If the weather is still bad today, it may be delayed by another day.</p>
<h3>Sun Zuji, Zhang Lianfang, Etc. to be Tried Today in the Morning and Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Gao Rao will try the two traitors Xue Gengcui and Sun Zuji this morning. In the afternoon, he will try Zhang Lianfang, Chen Jiufeng, Chen Jinsheng, Zhou Songping, Zhao Riliang, and other cases.</p>
<h3>Road Bureau Embezzlement Case, Zhang Bokang Makes a Strong Defense</h3>
<p>[Taibao News] The road bureau material department embezzlement trial, the district court has set the opening for the 20th morning. Zhang Bokang, one of the main criminals and the purchasing section chief, believes that there are two reasons for acquittal: (1) In the prosecutor's indictment of the facts of the crime, it is stated that after learning of the embezzlement, he contacted his superiors to collude, which was from the bottom up. However, the reason for the prosecution is that he colluded with his subordinates on orders to embezzle, which is from top to bottom, which is clearly contradictory to the former. (2) He is weak in nature, not strict in his management of subordinates, and easily surrounded and blinded by others. Failure to discover the embezzlement case is a fact, which can only constitute administrative punishment and does not involve the judiciary.</p>
<h3>Military Personnel Riding Trains: Free and Half-Price Measures</h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau, in order to give preferential treatment to active military personnel traveling on military business, has recently set the measures for active military personnel purchasing half-price tickets and riding for free. The measures are as follows: (1) On the Beijing-Shanghai Line, trains 51, 52, 53, 54, 57, 58, and on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line, trains 41, 42, 61, 62, 67, 68, special cars will be designated for military personnel. Active military personnel with complete uniforms and insignia may ride for free upon presenting their leave passes and having them stamped by the station military police. (2) In addition to riding the special military cars on the trains listed in the previous article according to the prescribed methods, active military personnel who wish to ride other cars on those trains, as well as trains 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 (excluding sleeping cars), 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76 (,77, 78 on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, and express trains such as 23, 24, 25, 26 on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, may purchase "military half-price tickets" at half price in cash by presenting their Class A travel permits or leave passes. (3) On the Beijing-Shanghai Line, trains 1, 2, 5, 6, 11, 12 express train sleeping cars, and trains 21, 22 express trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, since tickets must be sold in advance and seats must be reserved, all passengers must purchase full-price tickets according to regulations. Those using special half-price military tickets must wear military uniforms. If they are wearing plain clothes, they must still pay the difference according to the regulations for ordinary passengers. The above measures will officially take effect today.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Having read the news item in your esteemed newspaper of September 9th in the local news column concerning the grand gathering "Commemorating the September 8th Victory," which mentioned that Wang Xiaolai and Mrs. Chen Tingrui led the dance, I am extremely astonished. Since the War of Resistance, Tingrui has been far away in the wartime capital, Chongqing, while Yuzhen remained in Shanghai, raising the children and serving her parents-in-law. For five years, she has been overworked with household affairs, her spirit weakened, and she has never left home a single step. She was also unable to attend this commemorative celebration of victory. The information in your esteemed newspaper is based on hearsay and is untrue. Fearing misunderstanding among various circles, I hereby send this letter for correction.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhou Yuzhen respectfully</h3>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Venereal Disease Prevention Institute - If it can be used well, it is indeed an ideal hospital</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] Although the Mid-Autumn Festival has passed, the scorching heat remains, with no hint of autumn. The only thing that adorns this season is the Mid-Autumn mooncakes that have gone off the market.</p>
<p>In this summer within autumn, in order to understand the content of the Venereal Disease Prevention Institute, the reporter stepped onto Beile Road for the second time. The midday sun was truly powerful, baking the asphalt road until it was soft and cottony. With a heart full of enthusiasm, I put everything behind me, forgetting the scorching sun overhead and the empty stomach.</p>
<p>Stepping into the gate of the Venereal Disease Prevention Institute, I was greeted by nurse Qu Shuyu, who said the first sentence: "Oh, I'm really sorry, Doctor Dong Baoji has gone out again. Only he knows about the matters here." Because the reporter didn't want to come for a third time, I continued by saying, "It doesn't matter, I can wait for Doctor Dong and take a look around."</p>
<p>So Miss Qu led the reporter into an office and presented a piece of paper with the statistics of prostitute examinations, totaling from January to mid-August. Among the 2,473 individuals who were examined, only 893 were issued licenses after passing the examination. The general knowledge level of ordinary prostitutes is very low, and even if they have venereal diseases, they avoid seeking medical treatment. Their visits for examination are entirely due to the coercion of the police station, and most believe that it is not necessary. According to Miss Qu, some cases are more serious, spreading to the legs and forming a limp. After injections, medication, and long-term treatment, they can walk again. One of them even said that this was the result of burning incense and worshiping Buddha. Then, Miss Qu told the reporter many stories about the tragic lives of these sellers of flesh. Their willingness to engage in this lowly occupation is almost entirely due to the lash of life. Many more are because their husbands died in battle, leaving them unable to take care of the children. So the mothers sell themselves to raise their children. There are also many who are deceived and trafficked into hell. For example, when a father dies and there is no money for the funeral, the uncle sells the underage girl into a brothel, collecting 500,000 yuan. And this inherent, pure soul has no choice but to corrode with the years, little by little contracting the most deadly venereal diseases.</p>
<p>The tragic and horrifying stories told by Miss Qu are unimaginable to those living in paradise. Just as the reporter was listening attentively, the central figure of this news—Doctor Dong Baoji—arrived. The reporter was naturally overjoyed, because Miss Qu had said that only Doctor Dong knew the actual situation and future plans of the institute. But unexpectedly, Doctor Dong did not seem interested in the reporter's visit. When the reporter asked him about future plans, he said, "The current Venereal Disease Prevention Institute is unable to expand due to insufficient materials and funding. In the future, we hope to manage venereal diseases in a regulated manner and bring them onto the right track." After this observation, one thing that must be reported to the readers is the exquisite building construction of the Venereal Disease Prevention Institute. The tall, Western-style house is decorated with white tiles on all four walls. The equipment inside is very perfect. Such a well-built prevention institute, if it can be used well, is truly the most ideal. When the reporter went downstairs from the third floor (the prostitute examination area), there were doors everywhere, and it was impossible to find an exit. Suddenly, an old woman with fiercely raised eyebrows shouted at the reporter, "Go this way!" Under her guidance, I silently left the Venereal Disease Prevention Institute, unable to help but secretly gasp for the prostitutes who were seeking treatment! The image shows prostitutes being injected with a special drug for venereal diseases (photographed by this newspaper).</p>
<h3>Hang Weihan and Others Inspect Seawalls: South Seawall Project Completed, North Seawall Under Construction</h3>
<p>The seawall project in this city has been under active construction for less than two months, and the initial stage has been completed. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, Wang Bianshan, Deputy Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, Zhu Guoxi, Zhu Qingyu, Deputy Captains of the Seawall Engineering Team, Yu Zihou, Consulting Engineer of the Municipal Transport, accompanied Hang Weihan, member of the Party and Government Work Assessment Committee of the National Defense Council, and invited municipal councilors to inspect the status of the seawall project in Gaoqiao. The councilors were unable to participate because they were reviewing proposals yesterday. During this inspection, the 221-meter breach at Zhangjia Village on the south seawall, and the 1,244 meters at Daijiazhai, Lujiazhai, and Zhoujiazhai were all repaired. The above villages will be safe from the tide today. Deputy Director Wang expressed his sincere appreciation to the hardworking seawall workers. Regarding the north seawall, it is currently under construction, and a deadline has been set for completion. Commissioner Hang inquired about the details of the project, and Chief Captain Zhu answered each question. They returned to Shanghai at 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Air Force Preparing to Establish a Large-Scale Supply Organization in Shanghai</h3>
<p>New organizations under the Air Force Headquarters are being established step by step. It is learned that the Air Force Supply Headquarters, which oversees supply matters for the entire army, has begun preparations in Shanghai. Deputy Commander Colonel Hao Zhonghe has led his subordinates to Shanghai to oversee the establishment of the camp and takeover matters. Once the headquarters is established, the temporary material receiving agencies in various locations will be closed. Therefore, the organization of the headquarters is quite large, with six sections, three offices, and four independent divisions. The heads of the various subordinate units have already been internally determined. The preparatory work is expected to be largely completed by the end of this month. It is said that Commander Wang Weimin will come to Shanghai to take charge in early next month.</p>

<h3>Students from Six Reinstated Universities, Including Chongqing University, Request Admission from the Ministry of Education. They Held a Reception for Reporters in Nanjing Yesterday to Report on the Process</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 15th] Representatives of reinstated students from six universities, including Chongqing University, Sichuan University, Guizhou University, Yunnan University, Guizhou Medical College, and Guizhou Normal College, held a reception for reporters at 10:00 AM on the 15th to report on their request for admission from the Ministry of Education. They believe that the Ministry of Education lacks concern for the issue of seeking education after their return home, and if they did not urge them, even the "participate in the examination" promise would not be obtained. The relevant responsible persons of the Ministry of Education all shirked responsibility, using the excuse that the capacity of the reinstated universities was full, overturning the promises made in Chongqing of "transfer by order of the Ministry" and "equivalent to distribution by order of the Ministry." They believe that if the "capacity is truly full," the examination is simply a deception, and the date of the examination is still uncertain. Chongqing University will start school on the 20th, and Guizhou University on the 28th, causing concerns of being left out twice. After holding a plenary meeting of representatives on the 16th, they will meet with Minister Zhu, requesting two things: (1) Maintain the original proposal, distribute transfers to various universities. If academic review is required, it should be the same standard as the distribution of the Temporary University (70 points or above). (2) Because the matter is unresolved, causing excessive absenteeism from the original school, making it difficult to return to the original school, the ministry should be responsible for finding a solution. They told reporters that they really do not want to use strikes and parades as a means to achieve their goals like the students of the Temporary University, and hope that the Ministry of Education can accept their reasonable requests.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Councilors Suggest Actively Promoting Education, Increasing the Percentage of the Education Budget</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou] At the meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Council, some councilors suggested actively promoting the province's education, and the measures are: (1) Increase the number of national schools, striving to achieve the goal of one school per district, and in accordance with regulations, open adult classes and women's classes. (2) Universally establish secondary schools and vocational schools, and add classes and expand enrollment as much as possible. (3) Guarantee the livelihood of teachers and improve teacher qualifications. (4) Pay special attention to the cultivation of children's character and physical training. (5) Increase the number of publicly funded students to 20% to 30%. (6) Appropriately reduce tuition and miscellaneous fees and stipulate installment payment methods to lighten the burden on families. (7) Increase the percentage of education budget for provinces, cities, and counties. (8) Intensify the movement to donate funds for schools and determine the method of raising regular expenses for national schools. (9) The government continues to handle student loans to help poor students enter school.</p>
<h3>University Students in Chengdu Compete to Become Police Officers</h3>
<p>[News from Chengdu] The local water police station is recruiting police officers, and the number of applicants is very enthusiastic. Among the more than 500 students who applied, university students accounted for one-tenth, high school graduates accounted for four-tenths, and junior high school graduates accounted for five-tenths, breaking the unprecedented record of police quality. According to the person in charge of the station: it is gratifying that university and high school students are participating in the police force this time, but it is feared that they are temporarily seeking a livelihood due to economic pressure and do not have a sincere and long-term commitment to police work. Once there is another way, they may not resign immediately, which is also worrying.</p>
<h3>Recent News on Student Loans</h3>
<p>The National Goods Market Concludes Its Meeting Today, Zhang Xipeng Generously Donates 1 Million Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>The National Goods Market sponsored by the Shanghai Education Loan Committee concluded on the 5th. Some procedures for various manufacturers and schools have not yet been cleared, so the number could not be announced as scheduled. However, as of now, approximately 256 million yuan in cash has been received. The current Economic Management Committee has scheduled a closing meeting for today (the 16th) to determine the loan amount based on manufacturer commissions. In addition, some universities and secondary schools responsible for sales, such as Zhen Dan, Daxia, St. John's, Huxin, Yuying, Minli, Xinben, China, Sino-French, Tongyi, Xingwu, and China Vocational, have not yet submitted the cash and remaining coupons obtained from sales. It is reported that the committee has sent letters to the above schools urging them to settle accounts by a specific date. It is estimated that the committee's total income will be settled and announced within a few days.</p>
<p>Loan Principles Slightly Changed</p>
<p>Also reported: The investigation and review work for loan applicants has been completed. Currently, because Wang Zhengjun, the director of the review department of the committee, is attending the National Congress of the Youth League, it will be announced and notified to various schools after Wang returns to Shanghai within a few days and makes the final decision. However, according to the person in charge of the committee: in addition to a poor family as a basic condition, service performance is the most important factor in approving or not approving this loan, and 80% of the funds raised by each school will be used as the loan principle for that school. The committee believes that the funds raised this time are far from the original target. In addition to sending a letter to the Sports Association to hold charity sports competitions, it is currently approaching enthusiastic education supporters from all sectors of society to solicit donations. Tong Xipeng of Chengde and Co. generously donated 1 million yuan yesterday, which is deeply admirable.</p>
<p>Can Apply to the Schools Attended</p>
<p>It is heard that approximately 10,000 impoverished students in this city have applied to the Education Loan Committee for loans. The income of the committee for this loan is very small and difficult to meet the needs. Therefore, the tuition fee problem of the loan students this semester has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life.

<h3>Sino-French University Renamed Zhihui University, Advocated by Li Shizeng, Zhang Jingjiang, and Others</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] Li Shizeng, who was entrusted in Beiping, told reporters: Sino-French University will be renamed Zhihui University according to the world university opinion advocated by him and Zhang Jingjiang, and Zhihui University will also be established in Shanghai. Regarding the Atomic Research Institute of the Beiping Research Institute, it should only study atomic energy and atomic bombs, and should be studied by military agencies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] According to Yun Zheng, the director of the Overseas Chinese Education Research Institute of Zhihui University in the United States: Zhihui University in New York has four departments: the World College, the World Cooperation College, the Independent Chinese Linguistics Department, and the Overseas Chinese Education Research Institute. It will also establish a Chinese Culture College, with more than 200 students, mostly American. The Overseas Chinese Education Research Institute has an attached primary school with 300 students, mostly children of Bi. Zhihui University has purchased 30 acres of land in the suburbs of New York City and is raising funds to build a school.</p>
<h3>Hu Shi Expresses His Opinion: The Guidance System Should Not Control Thought, The Engineering and Medical Schools Should Each Extend the Term of Years</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper in Beiping] Dr. Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, recently expressed his opinion to reporters: Peking University's establishment of a five-year system for the School of Engineering and a seven-year system for the School of Medicine is based on the ministry's instructions. According to the ministry's order, the School of Medicine can be run for six to eight years. Because the courses and learning requirements of general engineering and medical schools are too many, they are each extended by one year. There will be no discussion of a six-year system for the Department of Law this year, but it is also necessary to extend it for the need for research. Extending the term of years must, of course, be reported to the ministry for record. As for the issue of the guidance system, Peking University has established a Guidance Committee. My personal opinion is that the guidance system should not be used to control students' thoughts and restrict students. In fact, it is not easy to achieve the effect of restriction. If it is used to guide and help students in terms of physical fitness, knowledge, and behavior, the meaning of the guidance system can be brought into play. The Guidance Committee is currently drafting measures.</p>

<h3>Hao Gengsheng's Inspection Report: The Situation of Education in the Northeast, Japanese Professors Expressed Their Willingness to Lower Their Salaries Because They Are from a Defeated Country, Xu Songming Expressed That Academics Have No Borders, and There Should Be No Distinction in the Treatment of Professors</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] Hao Gengsheng, a supervisor appointed by the Ministry of Education, recently prepared and submitted a report to the Ministry of Education on the situation of education in the Northeast after his inspection. The following is an excerpt from the inspection report:</p>
<p>Has a Practice Forest with an Area of 10,000 Hectares</p>
<p>(1) National Northeast University: The original school buildings of the school were occupied by the Japanese army as barracks before the September 18th Incident. At the beginning of the victory last year, guest troops were stationed in, and soon withdrew. When the national army did not arrive, the local situation was complicated, and nearby people entered the school to plunder. The school's books and teaching equipment were looted. Until recently, unemployed workers occasionally organized house demolition teams, gathering in groups at night. Fortunately, the protection force has now been strengthened to avoid further losses. The large sports field planned and built by Gengsheng in that year was once turned into a horse-raising farm by the Japanese army. All the iron fences and iron gates in the field were transported back by the Japanese army to be made into military supplies. After the restoration, many of the school's equipment were taken away. It is said that 50 trucks were used to transport them for six days and nights, and it is estimated that 70% to 80% of all the school buildings were damaged. They are now being repaired to be used when school starts this autumn. The establishment of the school's various colleges is still in line with the ministry's instructions. The Colleges of Liberal Arts, Law, Science, and Engineering will be restored to their original locations. The College of Agriculture plans to use the school buildings of the Agricultural University run by the puppet Manchukuo. The entire college covers an area of about 100 hectares, with complete equipment such as cattle sheds and horse stables. In addition, there is a practice forest in Linjiang County, Jilin, covering an area of 10,000 hectares, accounting for half of the county's area. The total cost of repairing the school is estimated to be 200 million yuan in negotiable securities, which the school has submitted to the ministry.</p>
<p>The Directors are Working Hard, and the Situation is Still Good</p>
<p>(2) Preparatory Class of Northeast University: The class has more than 3,450 students, including more than 630 girls. These students come from more than 260 middle schools, with complex sources and varying levels. Fortunately, the environment is still good. Some Japanese houses outside the school have been used as dormitories, and the students' lives have been stabilized. The main courses are Chinese, English, each five hours; Civics, Geography, History, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, each two hours; Music one hour, Physical Education two hours. The Literature and History group has two more hours of Chinese, and the Physics and Chemistry group has two more hours of Mathematics. There are more than 110 teachers and staff members, of which about 50 are staff members. Thanks to the efforts of the directors, the situation is still good.</p>
<p>One Died of Cholera, One Died of Lung Disease</p>
<p>(3) Shenyang Temporary University Tutoring Class: The class has more than 3,000 students, and more than 160 units are from schools above junior college. Students have different academic qualifications, so the levels are also inconsistent, and teaching is quite difficult. In addition, because there are so many students, dormitories and dining halls are problems. Currently, part of the Shenyang Medical College's school buildings are being borrowed. When the inspection was conducted, one student died of cholera, and another died of lung disease. The school has 800 to 900 students from 14 units of universities and junior colleges in the puppet Manchukuo. Recently, feeling that the environment is not suitable, they have requested the class to allow them to leave Pan Yang and go to Changchun to wait for the establishment of the Changchun University. Therefore, it is not easy for everything in the class to get on track. As for the funding, up to the beginning of July this year, only 20 million yuan in national currency was received from the headquarters.</p>
<p>800 Microscopes Still Remain</p>
<p>(4) National Shenyang Medical College: Formerly the Manchurian Medical University, it is divided into four departments: the University Department, the Specialized Department, the Preparatory Department, and the Pharmaceutical Specialty Department. It has a long history and a solid foundation. Currently, in terms of teachers and staff members, in addition to the Japanese who preside over the Pharmaceutical Specialty, who has been dismissed for improper conduct, most of the Japanese teachers with good experiences will be retained. The school has 43 Japanese professors, associate professors, and lecturers, and 47 Chinese associate professors. There is also an affiliated hospital, with 21 Chinese nurses, 109 Japanese nurses, 23 Japanese staff members, 5 pharmacists, 12 hospital police, and 120 workers. The school's equipment is quite complete. Taking microscopes as an example, 70 of them were taken away at the beginning of the victory, and 800 are still left. The affiliated hospital originally had 800 beds, and 400 of them were also taken away during the restoration. In the past few months, because there was no formal director, many minor problems occurred in the school. Recently, President Xu Songming took office, and the school's administration has a center, and everything is gradually getting on track. Many experienced Japanese professors are willing to stay at the school to teach, and said that because they are professors from a defeated country, their treatment should not be equal to that of Chinese professors. However, President Xu believes that academics have no borders, and there should be no distinction in the treatment of professors. Currently, all aspects of the school are harmonious and stable. The school's funding for this year, from April to July, received 9.5 million yuan in negotiable securities. Salaries of 3 million yuan are paid out every month and have been issued three times. The repair of all houses, the repair of walls, and the cleaning of waterways cost tens of thousands of yuan in negotiable securities. Currently, the funding is extremely tight. The hospital's income was initially only more than 3,000 yuan in negotiable securities per day, but recently it can receive more than 20,000 yuan per day. Regarding the process of changing the name of Shenyang Railway Medical College to National Shenyang Medical College, and issues such as academic system reform and financial assistance, President Xu has another detailed report that has been submitted to the ministry for review.</p>
<p>Teachers and Staff Serve with Undiminished Spirit</p>
<p>(5) Liaoning Medical College: Formerly known as the Xiaheyan Missionary Hospital, it is a private church school. It was founded by Sir Stockwell, an Englishman, in Shenyang in the eighth year of Guangxu. After several changes, it was renamed Liaoning Medical College. The equipment is fairly complete. Fortunately, the people concerned in the school have made every effort to maintain and coordinate it, so it has not been destroyed. There are currently 179 students in the school, including 38 girls. The funding for the college is gradually declining due to its private nature, but the teachers and staff members serve with undiminished dedication, which is commendable. The medical service provided by the college to the general public in Pan Yang can be described as well-known. The daily cost of food and medicine in the third-class ward is only 80 yuan in negotiable securities, 150 yuan in the second-class ward, and 200 yuan in the first-class ward. This is truly serving the society. The salaries of the college's professors are only 7,000 to 8,000 yuan in negotiable securities per month (ordinary university professors earn about 12,000 yuan per month).</p>
<p>Students Once Protected the School, and the Equipment Was Not Destroyed</p>
<p>(6) Shenyang Teacher Training Institute: The institute is held by the Youth Guidance Office of the Ministry. It is divided into two phases: graduation in three months and graduation in six months. There are more than 300 male students and about 70 female students. The funding is short and insufficient. The teaching at the institute adopts the methods and system of the Central Training Corps, and the spiritual performance and teaching equipment are still good. (7) Shenyang Youth Guidance Office Middle School Remedial Class: It is also held by the Youth Guidance Office of the Ministry, with more than 720 students, including about 90 girls. The monthly funding is also insufficient. The class address is the former site of the South Manchurian Middle School (the Japanese paid great attention to the school because it used to train lower-level staff of the South Manchurian Railway). About 280 students from the original South Manchurian Middle School transferred to the class and launched a school protection movement. The school's equipment has not been destroyed, and the English level of the original South Manchurian Middle School students is better in the class. The class has complete physics and chemistry equipment. The principal of the South Manchurian Middle School was Japanese and studied in the United States.</p>
<h3>City Education Bureau Proposes Organizing Educational Delegation; Drafts Proposal for City Council Resolution</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, in order to revitalize the city's education and continuously strive for improvement, urgently plans to organize an educational delegation for mutual learning. Therefore, it has drafted a proposal for the City Council to resolve. The content of the proposal is recorded below:</p>
<p>Reasoning</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest port in the East, with well-developed land and sea transportation. Its educational and cultural undertakings have always held a leading position in the country. Currently, international cultural exchange is frequent, and educational systems are rapidly changing. To revitalize the city's education, it is essential to meet international trends, adapt to the times, learn from foreign countries, absorb new ideas, and continuously make reasonable and effective improvements. Only then can the power of education be brought into play, and the spirit of national culture can be promoted. The Bureau, recognizing this, proposes to organize a foreign educational delegation. Every year or every two years, a delegation will be sent abroad for investigation, and reports will be compiled on the new systems in education and new measures in cultural undertakings in various countries, so that they can be adopted and implemented. This will allow the city's education to be continuously improved and become a model for education nationwide.</p>
<p>Measures</p>
<p>(1) The Bureau will hire prominent figures from the city's education and cultural circles to form a foreign educational delegation, and the municipal government will allocate special funds as investigation expenses. (2) The delegation will send members abroad for investigation once every year or every two years, depending on actual needs, for a period of six months to one year. (3) Before going abroad, the delegation must prepare an investigation plan and submit it to the Bureau for approval. After returning to the country, it should prepare a report on the actual situation of the investigation and suggestions for reform and submit it to the Bureau for adoption and implementation.</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Reopens in Jiangwan; Jiangwan Weidemai Road (formerly Yinxiang Road)</h3>
<p>Liangjiang Junior High School, formerly Liangjiang Women's Physical Education College, was largely destroyed by artillery fire during the August 13th Shanghai Battle and has been suspended for nine years. Principal Lu Lihua, after returning to Shanghai from Chongqing, immediately prepared for the reopening. The original school buildings that were not destroyed have been returned by military and political organs. This semester, only the junior high school will be opened, and the physical education department will be restored next year. The school is located in the suburbs, with quiet scenery suitable for study. It has school buses to pick up and drop off commuting students. The teachers hired are all knowledgeable scholars. The entrance examination is scheduled to be held on the 17th at the Municipal Stadium, and the school will open on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Association School Demands the Return of Property from Lin Da</h3>
<p>The Fair Road campus of the Second Elementary School affiliated with the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association was occupied by enemy forces after the National Army retreated west and was converted into a Japanese elementary school. After the victory, it was taken over by the Ministry of Education and lent to Lin Da, which in turn lent it to the Teacher Training Institute. Now that the Teacher Training Institute is about to end, not only has there been no news of its return, but Lin Da has also lent it to Ji Da for use as a business school without authorization. However, the association's elementary schools are in great need of school buildings, and many students from the same province are unable to attend school, which is highly inconsistent with the situation. Yesterday at 2 p.m., the parent-teacher conference jointly organized by the association's elementary schools specifically and jointly protested the forced occupation of the school buildings by Lin Da, requesting assistance from all sectors to immediately return them in order to reopen the school. It is reported that the Enemy Property Management Bureau has approved the return and has sent an official letter to the association.</p>

<h3>Professor Pei Fei Gives Lecture at Tongji; To Prevent Science from Destroying Humanity, More Research Should be Done on Human Relationships</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Dr. Pei Fei, a famous professor from Columbia University in the United States, was recently invited by Dr. Dong Xifan to give a lecture at Tongji University in this city, stating that: In the past two hundred years, the world's science has made extremely rapid progress. This is the result of research on things and matter, but to this day, research on human relationships remains in a very primitive era. We should strive to do more research, otherwise humanity will be destroyed by the science that is researched. Chinese science is still in a stage before the 1950s. In addition to actively creating scientists and engineering experts, we should pay more attention to social sciences to prevent humanity from being destroyed by abnormal development. Confucius and Mencius' philosophy more than two thousand years ago was a study of human relationships, and now we should do more research to keep pace with Einstein. However, Dr. Pei Fei repeatedly stated that he does not ignore the importance of natural sciences, but hopes that the audience will not ignore social sciences either, which won enthusiastic applause from the audience.</p>

<h3>Stock Exchange Officially Opens Today; Yesterday Hosted Journalists to Explain the Reform Situation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Securities Exchange is scheduled to officially open at 10 a.m. today, temporarily only conducting morning market trading, from 10 a.m. to 12 noon every day. At 5 p.m., collective reconciliation will be held. All details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., the Securities Exchange Authority held a tea party to entertain the press in this city. The general manager of the exchange, Wang Zhixin, assistant managers Yang Yinbo and Gu Meichang, chief secretary Hua Wenyu, manager Chen Jixun, deputy general managers Zhang Jisan and Shen Renzan, and other important officials, as well as more than 30 reporters from various newspapers, attended. During the meeting, General Manager Wang introduced the important officials of the exchange one by one and said: "I am very honored that you are here today. Since the opening of the exchange on September 9, we have been practicing trading and reconciliation procedures, and waiting for the government to issue the transaction tax collection methods and approve the method of paying part of the broker's security deposit with substitutes. At the latest, we will be able to officially open for trading on the 16th. Today, we are holding a meeting to explain the various procedures of the exchange and listen to your opinions. This year's system equipment has been carefully referenced and decided upon beforehand, and I believe it is forward-looking. There may be some unfamiliarity at the beginning, but I firmly believe that we will be able to achieve agility and accuracy."</p>
<p>Renovations were made to both the trading floor and the calculations.</p>
<p>Assistant Manager Yang continued: "The Business Department has a direct relationship with the opening of trading tomorrow (the 16th). The Trading Floor Department is responsible for the actual market transactions; the Calculation Department is responsible for the clearing of brokers' trades on the same day, so that settlement can be executed the next day. This time, due to the increase in the number of brokers, many of the old equipment and methods need to be added and revised to adapt to the actual needs."</p>
<p>In terms of the trading floor, the most important reform is the adoption of "counter-to-counter trading." This method was formulated by the Preparatory Committee after careful research and consideration. Because in the case of a sharp increase in the number of participants, failing to increase the trading location would be insufficient to cope. The main purpose of the counter is to decentralize the trading location to increase the trading area. Replacing the straight line with a circle, and replacing concentration with counters, the Preparatory Committee's method of maximizing limited location is indeed a major advancement. However, this method is not exactly the same as the ordinary counter-to-counter trading adopted by the former "Chinese Securities Brokers" and the blackboard system adopted by the "Public Association of Industries." Although it may be slightly inconvenient due to unfamiliarity and lack of practice at the first trial, it is also a necessary process in the reform. After several exercises and some improvements, trading has been able to proceed smoothly. Improvements include: (1) Increasing the size of the numbers written on the "market price board" in the four corners of the market. (2) The "market price board" rewrites the buying and selling prices. (3) The blackboards added to the trading counters simultaneously announce the buying and selling market prices. (4) Adjusting the positions of the trading counters for each listed security to make it easier to connect between counters.</p>
<p>In terms of calculation, there have also been reforms in the calculation methods. In the past, all calculation work was done by the exchange after business hours. It required a large number of people (more than 120) to work overnight, and sometimes it was impossible to "square up." Now that the number of brokers has increased several times, the complexity of reconciliation has also increased. Even if the number of calculation personnel is doubled, it is still difficult to cope in practice. Therefore, by referring to the bank check exchange method, a collective reconciliation system is stipulated. Brokers are required to send personnel to gather in the market at the designated time to reconcile accounts on the spot and "square up" the differences. Fortunately, with the cooperation of the brokers, the procedures have gradually become skilled after several days of practice. In short, the business of the exchange is complex and involves thousands of threads. With today's limited material conditions, we can only gradually seek continuous improvement, and we hope that you will give us more guidance.</p>
<p>Review Standards for Fluctuation Limits</p>
<p>The Exchange's General Manager Wang and Manager Yang answered questions raised by the newspapers as follows: (1) Listed stocks must be applied for and approved before they can be listed. This time, a total of 20 types have been approved. The standard is that the content of the stock is solid and it is already circulating in the market, the so-called hot stocks, but all are of a trial listing nature: (2) In order to prevent sharp rises and falls from affecting the entire financial situation, the rise and fall of listed stocks have been approved by the authorities to stipulate the limits. First, for general stock prices below 100 yuan, the rise and fall limit is 20 percent. Second, for those above 100 yuan and below 5,000 yuan, it is 15 percent. Third, for those below 5,000 yuan, it is 10 percent. The rise and fall limit for each stock is posted on the trading counter by the exchange every day. There is only one limit per day. All transaction prices must not be higher than the high price of the announced limit or lower than the low price of the announced limit. If the rise or fall of the securities price reaches this limit, the exchange may apply to stop the trading of some or all securities. The length of time the trading is suspended will depend on the circumstances.</p>
<p>Do Spot Trading First, Settlement the Next Day</p>
<p>Stock trading is divided into two types: spot and term. Before the war, securities trading was mainly term trading, supplemented by spot trading. Today, only spot trading will be conducted. All transactions concluded on the same day must be squared up on the same day and settled on the next day. The buyer must pay the price to the exchange by 12 noon on the next day at the latest, and the seller must submit the securities to the exchange by 3 p.m. on the next day at the latest.</p>
<p>Temporarily Set Handling Fee Collection Rate</p>
<p>The Exchange also issued Stock Market Announcement No. 5, stating: "The collection rate for the Exchange's handling fees is temporarily set as follows: For stock trading handling fees, both brokers will each collect 0.75 per thousand of the value of the goods. When the buying and selling brokers are the same person in each transaction, and for internal transfer transactions, only 0.75 per thousand will be charged." Announcement No. 6 stated: "The commission charged by each broker to the buying and selling principals will be temporarily set at 3 per thousand for stock commissions before the Brokers Association is organized, the commission rate is formulated and reported to the Exchange for approval."</p>
<p>Finally, reporters from various newspapers asked technical questions about trading methods, preventing speculation and manipulation in the exchange, and cracking down on black market trading. General Manager Wang and others answered them one by one based on the exchange's compilation of overviews and operating rules. The meeting ended at around 6 p.m.</p>
<h3>Serious Theft of Passengers and Cargo on the Yangtze River; Shipping Industry Should Be Responsible for Protection; Chamber of Commerce Earnestly Advises Against Individual Merchants' Mocking</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Seashore Groceries and Northern Goods Commercial Associations, stating that members often purchased products such as wood ear, lotus seeds, pickled mustard, daylily, peach kernels, and various northern goods and groceries from the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River in the Yuyu, Yihan, and Xun areas, and when they were delivered by various shipping companies to Shanghai warehouses, they were often stolen en route. In some cases, as much as 10 to 20 percent was missing, causing merchants to suffer considerable losses. The Chamber of Commerce, according to the situation, separately wrote to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Dada, Sanbei, Minsheng, and other shipping companies, as well as the Shanghai Municipal Port Affairs Management Committee, stating that Article 634 of the Civil Code stipulates that the carrier shall be liable for the loss of goods carried, except for force majeure. Article 97 of the Maritime Law also has the same provisions. Theft is not something that cannot be prevented by human effort, and the shipping company is legally responsible and cannot shirk responsibility with excuses. Even from the perspective of the shipping company's responsibility to serve industry and commerce, on the one hand, it has recovered shipping rights and earnestly appealed to gain the sympathy of the world. On the other hand, it should eliminate long-standing malpractices and set an example to meet the expectations of the industrial and commercial circles. The matter is corresponding and cannot be neglected. Otherwise, it will only sadden the people and be mocked by foreign merchants. Therefore, we earnestly request that your company, etc., with an open and sincere attitude, make a brave expression of responsibility, and admonish employees to effectively stop the evil habit of stealing passengers and cargo en route, and prevent it from happening again after the victory and the recovery of shipping rights.</p>
<h3>When will Government Bonds Open for Trading? Ministry of Finance is Reviewing</h3>
<p>After the reopening of the Shanghai Securities Exchange, various industrial securities have been approved, and they will be listed for trading today. However, the date for government bonds to be listed has not yet been announced. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance, at the beginning of the exchange's reopening, the primary purpose of listing industrial securities for trading is to allow industrial funds to circulate and absorb idle funds. The order in which the various government bonds issued before and after the war are listed should be carefully reviewed and determined based on the circumstances of each bond and the state of the market. The exchange has submitted a request for approval in accordance with the General Rules for Listed Securities and its Operating Rules. The types of government bonds to be listed are being carefully reviewed by the Ministry, and as soon as they are determined, the exchange will be notified.</p>

<h3>Counterfeit Ancient Porcelain Criticized by Foreigners</h3>
<p>[United Press International, San Francisco, 14th] Australian Radio broadcast today that British sailors from Shanghai said that forged Chinese ancient porcelain is being sold around the world, and only experts can identify such products. This type of fraudulent sale is very popular in China, and unscrupulous merchants are making countless profits.</p>
<h3>Approved for Publication (4): Isolated Zhengyangguan</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Zhengyangguan by Our Newspaper's Correspondent Shao Shenzhi, dated August 26th</p>
<p>If you are in a cheerful mood, sitting in the Bund Park and admiring the waves of the Huangpu River, their surging and crashing against the embankment stones, listening to their flute-like sounds that pluck at your heartstrings, your emotions will become even more refined. If you are in a bad mood, it's also not impossible to dispel your worries here. It's a pity that the Huangpu is too narrow, and ships gather like clouds. The noise of the city is too clamorous, and it has already lost its pure natural beauty.</p>
<p>Controlling the Confluence of Seventy-Two Rivers, Only One Square Kilometer Remains</p>
<p>Zhengyangguan is different. Originally, it bordered the Huai River to the north and the Pi River to the west; across the water to the west was the Ying River, all of which are much wider than the Huangpu River. In autumn, the clouds and the sails cast shadows over tens of thousands of acres, stretching as far as the eye can see. Being in that place is truly pleasing to the eye. The various rivers of northwestern Anhui converge and flow east here, said to number as many as seventy-two. Zhengyangguan controls the benefits of the plains and can be described as a "land of fish and rice." Not many places in China can boast of this. It is the only important town in central China that controls the confluence of seventy-two rivers, acting as a hub for trade.</p>
<p>However, ever since the Yellow River diverted its course and flowed east through the Ying River, Zhengyangguan has encountered the same flood disaster it experienced in the 20th year of the Republic (1931). It almost declared total submersion, with not a single piece of farmland visible except for a few buildings. Yesterday, when I arrived here, I took a small boat to the back entrance of a hotel and stepped onto the precious land. I found that Zhengyangguan was surrounded by water on all sides, turning it into an isolated island. The Ying, Huai, and Pi Rivers could no longer be distinguished. At its worst, less than one square kilometer of Zhengyangguan remained above the water. Now, with the water receding, one can walk on the small patch of land, slightly more than one square kilometer, without getting one's feet wet.</p>
<p>Three thousand residents live on this piece of land. I walked along the edge of the water and land, which naturally didn't take much effort. Looking into the distance, the water and sky were the same color. If it weren't for a few rooftops or treetops sticking out of the water, one would almost think that they were on the other side of the sea. As I was walking across a garden—what was said to be the edge of the water and land—the mud, soaked and softened by the water, was over my ankles. The waves crashed in, washing away large patches of mud. The spray reached five or six feet high, and the edge of the land was being eroded like this. The buildings had collapsed brick walls, leaving only leaning roof frames. The scene was truly terrifying, making me tremble with fear that the water would suddenly rise and rush up, leaving no time to escape, and everything would be swept away. I thought that such a large body of water would not find it difficult to swallow this small patch of land, barely more than one square kilometer, in one gulp.</p>
<p>Yellow River Carp Swim Southward, Disaster Victims Humorously Go Fishing</p>
<p>Those children standing next to me, gazing at the distant former homes—now only rooftops visible—were silent. The waves beat against their bodies, cruelly shattering their innocent dreams, leaving them despondent. Small boats, loaded with farmers, bravely navigated the waves to visit their homes. Indeed, all the signs of the villages had been submerged. They lived on the small island that remained, looking up to the sky every day. They didn't think about the government or philanthropists, only hoping that the flood would recede soon, so that they could muster their spirits to struggle for their survival after the disaster. These small island groups were approximately five li apart from each other, or more than ten li in some cases, scattered like stars in the sky. Therefore, standing on this large isolated island of Zhengyangguan, as far as I could see into the "sea," I couldn't see many of the small islands mentioned above. I only saw those brave small boats turning past the green willows, disappearing at the end of the "sea" in an instant.</p>
<p>The beach is only ten meters away from where I am staying. A few days ago, the house was already flooded. The watermark on the wall is still visible. Now that the water has receded slightly, the ground is covered with lime, so I can settle down. However, the "sea" is only ten meters away, and the waves are crashing relentlessly day and night against the brick walls of the house, hitting forty waves per minute. One wall has already collapsed and the attack hasn't stopped.</p>
<p>However, in Zhengyangguan, I ate Yellow River carp, costing four hundred yuan per catty. This, of course, is thanks to "the Yellow River waters coming from the sky." Some residents, because their homes were flooded, could only walk on wooden planks laid over the water. Getting in and out naturally required boats. With nothing to do, they had no choice but to sit at their doorsteps and fish, with a leisurely attitude, truly demonstrating the humor of those who understand life.</p>
<p>Ancient Yangshi Old Pass, Tax Officials Still Carry on the Legacy</p>
<p>Zhengyangguan was formerly known as Yangshi. The "Taizhou Gazetteer" states: "Zhengyangguan is located sixty li southwest of the prefecture. Zhengyang borders the land route, connecting the prefectural city to the east, Liuan Prefecture to the south, Huoqiu County to the southwest, and Hongze Lake to the lower reaches. It was established as a pass in the first year of Chenghua during the Ming Dynasty." According to the "Treatise on Food and Money," "Zhengyangguan was required to collect 62,446 taels, 3 qian, 6 hao, and 5 si of silver in taxes."</p>
<p>Now there is only a tax collection office of the county's commodity tax bureau. But what commodity tax can be collected on this isolated island? Yet, there are nearly twenty staff members, which is irregular. It seems they are not afraid of losing money. When the boat I was on approached Zhengyangguan, a figure dressed in a short jacket and silk trousers jumped onto the boat from a small boat and began searching everywhere, acting extremely nervously. He was randomly touching and asking about everything, frightening the country bumpkins who were panicking and stammering. A gentleman on the boat said to me, "You don't know, they can collect taxes in any way possible. The country bumpkins have no knowledge." Later, I also learned that every shop in Zhengyangguan town has to pay so-called Baojia donations to the town government, depending on the size of the shop front, ranging from 10,000 to 60,000 yuan per month. Are these merchants all country bumpkins? If a stray soldier or vagrant dies of illness, the town government has another excuse to apportion the costs to each household. These merchants always complain first, then comply, and in the end, always pay up.</p>
<p>Only a Circle of City Walls Encloses a Circle of Dry Land</p>
<p>Now, let's return to Zhengyangguan. The pass resembles a two-story drum tower, but unlike drum towers, which usually have city gates beneath them, this one is a platform built of stone blocks, its height equal to half of the entire structure. Stone steps are attached to the outside, allowing one to climb the pass. This historical relic is now naturally very dilapidated, and the stone platform is completely submerged in water. I could only see its front by boat. Now, there is no need to climb the steps, as a boat can be driven right in.</p>
<p>Wang Zhaokui of Quanjiao in the Qing Dynasty wrote a poem "Passing Zhengyang River": "Halting my horse at the pass entrance, I call for a ferry boat; The boat glides like a leaf, the rising water seems to touch the sky. Old houses reveal their roof beams, fish swim among the treetops; A myriad of feelings arise in the vastness, the setting sun descends into the pale mist." This still reflects the scenery today, but at that time, one could still "halt a horse at the pass entrance," and although the fish had already reached the treetops, the water level was not yet too high. It can also be seen that the road was still passable, allowing one to halt a horse and call for a ferry. Now, I can sail a boat to the pass. The highway is submerged in water, several zhang below the surface. I just met a group of engineers from the Ministry of Transportation who were sent to repair the national highway from Liuan to Zhoujiakou. They were forced to wait on this isolated island with nothing to do. It is said that the road has been preliminarily surveyed and requires 800,000 cubic meters of earth and the construction of fifty-six bridges. A section chief named Sun was robbed by armed men, allegedly posing as soldiers, on the way to Fuyang.</p>
<p>Tang Dynasty poet Song Zhiwen's poem "First Night at the Huai Estuary" states: "At night, the Chu songs evoke unbearable homesickness, especially at the time of year when the trees are shedding leaves in the Huainan region." He was also in this place, but he was homesick, which is irrelevant to us. However, Huangfu Ran's poem states: "...How can the evening mists and frosts be described? West of Shouyang, the water is endless!" He was merely using literary exaggeration, but now it has truly become a prophecy. It is not just west of Shouyang; now, Shou County relies on a circle of city walls to enclose a circle of dry land. The people of Shou County are reliving old historical lessons. Alas!</p>
<p>Reliving Old Historical Lessons, The People's Fate Is Shared with Fish and Shrimp</p>
<p>Zhengyangguan belongs to Shou County. Its local history is originally a record intertwined with floods and warfare.</p>
<p>"In the Yichou year of Yongle (1405), the Huai River flooded, and the Fei River silted up, turning into a lake, causing damage to the northwest city walls year after year, being repaired and destroyed without a single peaceful year. In the summer of the Ding Si year of Zhengtong (1437), continuous rain fell for more than three weeks, causing the Huai and Fei Rivers to connect. The narrow mouth of the Xiakou Pass could not handle the rushing flow, so the four gates were closed, and earth and wood were transported to prevent the flood. Only three feet of the battlements remained above water, causing panic and fear among the old and young. Commander Liu Hou urgently dispatched transport ships and seized merchant vessels to first transport the elderly and weak to the Huai mountains, and then moved the young and strong to the high ground on the southeast city walls, allowing the people to rest. Then, on the first day of June, a strong northwest wind blew, and huge waves crashed against the city walls, causing 798 zhang to collapse, with over 6,650 chi of embankments. Towers, turrets, wood, and stone were all swept away in an instant." (Record of the Reconstruction of City Turrets in Shouzhou Wei by Luo Zhi of the Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p>"In the mid-Jiading period (1522-1566), the Yellow River changed course, and torrential floods flowed from the Xu and Pei regions into the Huai and Fei Rivers, passing through Hao and Si to reach the sea. It first flowed against the Hao River, passing the core of the Huachen Lake, where silt accumulated in nine out of ten places. During the peak summer months, torrential rains occurred repeatedly. The Ying, Liu, Ru, and Ying Rivers, along with the raging waves, flowed down again. The mouth of the Xiakou Pass was blocked, causing the floodwaters to stagnate and spread, covering mountains and hiding trees, boundless at a glance. The water pressed against the city, leaving only a few feet of space, and the wind blew and shook the waves. The people drove their lives and industries, sharing their fate with the fish and shrimp." (Record of Soil Reinforcement of the Earth City by Xie Zhongzeng of the Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p>"In the Bing Yin year of Jiading (1566), a great flood breached the city, and countless residents were buried in the bellies of fish." (Record of the Reconstruction of Shouzhou City by Xie Kaichong of the Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>"In the sixth year of Shunzhi (1649), continuous rain caused a great flood to surround the city, reaching within a foot of the battlements. More than a thousand zhang of the city wall collapsed." "In the fifth year of Tongzhi (1866), the great flood reached within a foot of the battlements." (Shouzhou Gazetteer)</p>
<p>This year is once again reliving the old lesson: "Within a foot of the battlements." The 20th year of the Republic (1931) has already been experienced once. Generally, the Huai River floods are not caused by the Huai River itself rising suddenly, but by the Yellow River diverting its course. However, tracing back to the root cause, it is still the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Sun Jiading of the Qing Dynasty wrote: "During the Daoguang years (1821-1850), the Yellow River breached its banks repeatedly, flowing into the Huai River through two waterways, carrying silt and sand. The Huai River suffered as a result. Therefore, the lower reaches of Shou, such as Huaiyuan, Linhuai, Wuhe, and Xuyi counties, all of which the Huai River passes through, were silted up and lost their commanding position, unable to flow smoothly, and the flooding of Shou became even more severe."</p>
<p>Asking the elders and verifying with history, the residents have been paying taxes to build the city and repair the dikes for thousands of years, with hardly a peaceful year. They have consumed a large amount of materials and labor, and it cannot be said that they have not exhausted their wisdom. However, the Yellow and Huai Rivers are a major problem that cannot be slightly reversed by the residents of one place. The flood of the 20th year of the Republic (1931) was due to the rise of the Huai River, while this year it is the Yellow River diverting its course, also carrying silt and sand. The Huai River bed will be further silted up, and if the water rises again in the future, the disaster will undoubtedly become more serious. But today, stopping the boat at the Zhengyangguan Pass, looking north at the vast river, the water and sky boundless, only increases the emotion of sorrow!</p>
<p>The Liang Dynasty Fought Over Weirs, The Jin Dynasty Saw Grass and Trees as Soldiers</p>
<p>Since the Jin, Song, Qi, and Northern Wei dynasties, the divisions and changes of power all regarded Taizhou as an important town. Song Zhenxi Mountain said: "The key to the east of the Huai lies in the Qinghe Estuary, and the key to the west of the Huai lies in the Wo and Ying Estuary." The Ying Estuary is Zhengyangguan. In ancient times, there was no Longhai Railway, no cars. Troops could rely on land marches, and the water transport depended on the three estuaries, so the military situation entirely depended on the gains and losses of the Huai River. The Wei and Jin dynasties used troops to compete with Jiangdong for hegemony, first occupying Shouchun to control the Fei Estuary and protect Zhengyang. In times of division, the north and south of the Huai River were often cleared for hundreds of miles, and Zhengyang was the hub for naval forces, occupied as a key location. In the third year of YanChang (514 AD), the Liang built a floating mountain, and the water invaded, harming the Huai and Si Rivers. Cui Liang attacked the Liang army at Xiashi (Fei Estuary). In the second month of the fourth year, Xiao Shi greatly defeated the Liang army in the Huai River region. In the ninth month, the Huai weir burst, and more than 100,000 people of the Liang Dynasty were all swept into the sea. A war was launched for the sake of a dam. Fighting for water is the most obvious example. At that time, this place belonged to Liang Yuzhou. Liu Laozhi broke its general Liang Cheng and beheaded him. Liu Yuanfu defeated Fu Jian with 8,000 soldiers. In the Battle of Feishui, every grass and tree looked like a soldier. It was a famous battle in history. Later, Liu Yuan garrisoned Xuzhou, managing the Central Plains, following the trend of the eastward flow, and annexing the area east of the Yangtze River. As for the late Ming Dynasty, there were roaming bandits coming from the west, occupying Zhengyangguan as their stronghold. It cannot be said that they were ignorant of the advantages of the terrain. They then attacked Taizhou. Fang Zhenru led the army and the people to defend it, but it did not fall after half a month. The roaming bandits then fled east to Dingyuan and eventually collapsed from hunger. During the Shizong Dynasty, Zhao Kuangyin led his troops to attack Shouzhou for three years without success. Liu Renzhan of the Southern Tang Dynasty defended it with strong walls, relying on the water to hold firm, and fought against the Zhou army at Zhengyang, defeating the Zhou army. The Zhou army then trained a naval force to capture it, occupying Di, He, Guang, and Shu up to Yangzhou, and cutting off its grain and supplies. However, Shouzhou did not fall, and the other states could not be secured. During the Xiande years, Shouzhou was captured, and the wind shook the Huai and Si Rivers. Jin Wuzhu crossed the Huai River to occupy Zhengyang and Shouchun, and the Yangtze River was empty, causing shock throughout the country. Yue Fei led his troops east, and the Huai generals were fearful. Only Han Shizhong defeated the Jin army at Shouzhou and Zhengyang. Wuzhu then took the Ying Estuary, leading his troops north. The Yangtze River was slightly relieved, and the Song Dynasty was able to reorganize its military preparations. The importance of the Ying Estuary is evident from this.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Supervised the Battle in the Northern Expedition, Enemy寇 Crossed the Pass Three Times</p>
<p>During the Northern Expedition, Chairman Chiang supervised the battle at Zhengyangguan, and the army marched out of the Huai River region to meet the Longhai Railway in order to capture Xuzhou. In the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), there was a street named "Zhongzheng" in Zhengyangguan. During the great flood of the 20th year (1931), the water level in Zhengyangguan was several feet higher than this year, and this street was particularly high, making it the only place not flooded.</p>
<p>After the Anti-Japanese War, in April of the 27th year (1938), the enemy occupied Bengbu and in May lost Xuzhou. The enemy then regrouped from Xuzhou and Jining and went back to Kaifeng, and then attacked Kaifeng with the enemy crossing the Yellow River from the south. Kaifeng fell on June 5th. The enemy in the Anhui region had already knocked on Zhengyangguan, posing a threat to take Pinghan along the Huai River. The Yellow River dikes broke, causing flooding in the Central Plains, thwarting the enemy's entire plan to take Wuhan along the Pinghan Line that year. The enemy occupied Zhengyangguan for only three days before withdrawing, returning to capture Shou County. This flood indeed delayed the enemy's offensive for three months. In September, the enemy used motorboats to travel up the Huai River from the west, passing Zhengyangguan and reaching Huangchuan. After landing, they captured Weishan and entered Xinyang, and then attacked south along the Pinghan Road. The land route also took Zhengyangguan, transporting supplies to capture Gushi, Shangcheng, and Macheng, and then jointly attacked Hankou. The enemy transported grain and ammunition, implementing a major encirclement of Wuhan, passing directly through Zhengyangguan. The entire army fled west, without occupying every stronghold they passed through. "Bandits" then took the opportunity to extort money from the residents, threatening to shoot in the town, in the assumption that the enemy forces might land, Zhengyangguan would be slaughtered. After suffering extortion, the residents had to find boats to send them away. Looking back on the past, the residents were all frightened and had headaches. In the 33rd year (1944), the Central Plains battle began. This was a battle that resulted in a great loss of face. The enemy troops once again passed through Zhengyangguan, and infantry and cavalry went up the Ying River, capturing Yingshang. Originally, they planned to enter the Yellow River area from the south with a long diversion, but were met with a head-on attack from our elite troops. It can be said that it was the first time they had suffered a serious foreign attack when passing through the Huai River. They then retreated, abandoning corpses, and returned to Shou County and Xinbu. The originally stationed army that had suddenly disappeared re-entered Zhengyangguan and built large-scale fortifications. The officers who built these fortifications even erected stone tablets, recording their achievements, saying that they had driven away the enemy with these fortifications. The people said: "He has turned the days upside down."</p>
<p>Digging into the Zhengyang Legends, Writing History Will Be a Sensation</p>
<p>The enemy cavalry roamed around, but Zhengyangguan was unharmed because Zhengyangguan had become a smuggling hole. The companies and firms of those big shots numbered in the dozens, and the population had jumped from 30,000 to 100,000. The mechanical factory of the original No. 9 Vocational Middle School had become a warehouse for the Anhui Provincial Enterprise Company. Although the Japanese didn't arrive, Koreans came here to do business openly and brazenly. Mohekou, across the river from Zhengyangguan, was another gateway and another group. There were many disputes between the two sides, but some Shanghai businessmen came out and said a word, and the deal was settled, which was relatively eased. When they brought up the past, they still remembered it vividly, such as how they did business with arms, as if this was inseparable from the past glory, and it was much more interesting than talking about today's flood. The so-called commodity exchange, using tung oil to exchange lipstick and beer, and those companies even included the transport of their families. To put it nicely, the work of these companies and firms had never been inspected. The most that could be said was that they did not publish battle reports and achievements, unlike military affairs with obvious gains and losses, so they made a mess of it all. However, the people of Zhengyangguan were very clear. They had seen enough with their own eyes. With a state of emergency declared, goods entered and left like a tide under unified inspection. The commodity tax bureau of today is like a lifetime ago, inevitably full of vicissitudes, but with or without taxes, there must always be the strength of guns, and then there can be an "economic war," otherwise the war will not be fought and will be completely defeated. The people said they all got rich—they won.</p>
<p>Zhengyangguan is a gateway, while Jieshou is a transfer station. Above the Ying River, it was prosperous all the way. After the victory, the prosperity of Mohekou and other places disappeared rapidly. Zhengyangguan returned from 100,000 people to 30,000, as if it was a dream. It is still strange that in the 33rd year (1944), as the situation in the Central Plains tightened, those warehouses and shops had to affix the Japanese military's symbols taken from Shou County to protect themselves. Is this the economic warfare characteristic of Zhengyangguan? This is a place where legends were born, and although other legends are being created elsewhere, the glory of Zhengyangguan is indelible. Since the Anti-Japanese War, no reporter from the rear has come here to observe. After the Anti-Japanese War, I am still the first, but I regret that I have come too late, and many legends have lost their freshness. If someone wrote an objective history of Zhengyangguan in the last eight years, exposing many faces, it would definitely be a sensation.</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway's Fourth Line Is Interrupted, Resuming the Smuggling Route</p>
<p>After the victory, the speed at which the 70,000 people were demobilized was quite admirable, and they left completely within a few months. The remaining local people are now dazed in the encirclement of water. Those small merchants have indeed gained some benefits. In recent months, they have been too lazy to set sail. They have to collect enough fares, load enough goods, and make enough money before they make a trip up or down. It is not uncommon to buy a ticket and wait four or five days. Everything is in their hands, and the country bumpkins have no choice but to tremble under their power. Because of overloading, it also happened that people and goods sank in the turbid flow. There is no greater monopoly of transportation than this. The Anhui Provincial Highway Bureau has no way to do things, and it also does transportation, which is no different from doing business. The Zheng-Beng Joint Transport on the Huainan Line always sails every day, regardless of whether there are passengers or not, which is quite convenient for merchants, but it is attacked for the "monopoly" crime, because merchants have a choice of objects.</p>
<p>With the Longhai Road cut off, the first and second batches of guests from the Central Plains to Jiangsu and Anhui have taken the route from Luohe Jieshou to reach here. You can take a car between Luohe and Jieshou and arrive in one day. The waterway between Jieshou and Zheng requires V time to reach the Pinghan Road. This route was originally a smuggling route in the past. Unexpectedly, it is still useful one year after the victory, but it is still a dangerous route. If the Longhai continues to be inaccessible, this transportation line can still slightly revive the face of prosperity, but it is not a stop, but a passage.</p>
<p>The Grieving Son Suckles on His Wet Nurse's Corpse, The Plague God Wears Fur Coats Backwards</p>
<p>Walking on the streets of Zhengyangguan, this isolated island is not all dry land. There are puddles of accumulated water everywhere. You have to have some skill to walk on a wooden plank. I saw a group of people wearing filial piety clothes walking on the road. A person in front of them was sending thank-you notes to the households, and then a person wearing filial piety clothes would kneel and kowtow at the door. This family had just finished a funeral and was now going door-to-door to thank those who came to offer condolences. Even in the shacks where the disaster victims live, people wearing filial piety clothes can be seen everywhere, white from head to toe. The flood brought not only water but also plagues. According to the statistics of a private hospital, more than 500 people have died in the past 20 days, all from cholera. An average of 20 people die every day, with a record high of more than 60 people dying every day! More than 1,000 people have been cured of the disease. In short, these are terrible numbers. Only coffin shops have good business. Residents do not believe in getting vaccinated, and there was a shortage of vaccines at the time. Does the administrative agency care? It doesn't care. It only handles official documents. A few bottles of vaccines were sent from Shou County just two days ago. (Also, the Relief Administration had 3,000 bags of flour to distribute to Shou County. The people of Zhengyangguan said: We didn't see a single grain.)</p>
<p>The vaccines have arrived, and enough people have already died. In fact, vaccines alone cannot save the people. It also requires publicity and persuasion, with organization, so-called administration, but none of this is talked about. Dr. Xu Zhishen told me that he spoke until his tongue was dry, telling residents the importance of getting vaccinated. If he charged a fee, he would be suspected of seeking business for himself. He is not a doctor, but he is a trusted doctor in the region. The Shoumin Hospital he established has become a plague hospital. If valued at market prices, injecting 3,000 cc of salt water would cost 100,000 yuan, which is definitely not affordable for the poor (a coffin is only 40,000 to 50,000 yuan). His self-made salt water has saved many people here and is praised by the townspeople.</p>
<p>Residents who contract diseases naturally do not all go to the hospital. They also have their own treatment methods. In the evening, you can hear the sound of firecrackers being set off loudly. A person comes out of a household, wearing a fur coat backwards, with his face painted like a clown. Firecrackers are set off behind him, and the place where this gentleman walks is swept with a broom. This gentleman is a "Plague God." After this procedure, it is considered that the Plague God has been sent away. This is one of the standard treatments.</p>
<p>One family didn't open the door all day. There were originally a mother and son living inside. The neighbors broke down the door and found that the woman had died of infection, and her son was still sucking on her breast. It is truly a terrifying place!</p>
<p>Northern Anhui Is Facing Famine, Warfare Cannot Be Seen Again</p>
<p>Although Zhengyangguan is harmed by water, it also relies on water for its position. The disaster situation in the entire Northern Anhui region is extremely serious. The reporter has been living on Zhengyangguan Island for several days and has repeatedly heard of bandits robbing nearby flooded villages. After the Yellow River receded, the flooded areas were covered with silt several feet thick. This road is obstructed, and pedestrians are unable to walk. It is like the first thawing of the icy river in northern Sai, and even if you step on it, you are in danger of being submerged. Residents use long wooden planks as levers, stepping on the mud. This is a feature of the Yellow River silt. Therefore, if there is a war, this area is not suitable for speeding. At present, the Pi River can still be used to transport the abundant grains of Liuan. The price of rice is 50,000 yuan per 250 catties, which is relatively low. But compared to the income of the general public, it is no lower than Beijing and Shanghai. It is hard to believe that famine can be avoided.</p>
<p>The most serious problem is the appearance of bandits. It is said that Zhao Guan 余, Zhao Chou, and his armed forces of about 700 or 800 people are east of Tai County. They claim to be the Communist Army. If the famine victims attach to them, and the Communist Army uses them, then it will become a force that confronts the government head-on. Armed forces scattered elsewhere are indistinguishable by name, and people traveling in northern Anhui are suffering greatly, and there are also "impostor" troops.</p>
<p>After the border conflict between Henan and Hubei broke out, the Communist Army of Li Xiannian entered northern Anhui and eastern Anhui. One route went along the irrigation river in southern Henan, passed through Sanhejian to cross the Ying River, and went to the outer edge of Xuzhou through Wo and Meng; another route went along the eastern foothills of Mount Huoshan, through Maotanchang and Guanting west of Hefei, and then crossed the Huainan Road to the vicinity of Mingguang to northern Jiangsu. The purpose was to gather the main force, avoid being scattered, and military transfers were very busy, with many stragglers. According to people from Sanhejian, they passed through at the beginning of this month, demanding grain and vegetables from the local area. Without stopping, they went north.</p>
<p>The Nationalist Army guards key points, if they are trapped by grain. The important town of Zhengyang, which has always been important for warfare, is an area for military affairs, not a place for military preparations. After the Northern Expedition, there were ten years of war. In the spring of the 20th year (1931), Peng Dehuai's and Xu Xiangqian's troops once occupied Zhengyangguan from the border between Henan, Hubei, and Anhui for only three days. Xu Tingyao's troops attacked it from Bengbu along the Huai River. The Communist Army attacked and captured Jinjiazai. The Communist Army then withdrew completely from Anhui Province.</p>
<p>Today, the disaster victims in Northern Anhui are everywhere. The disasters of floods are enough. It is impossible to sweep away the areas harassed by the knife troops!</p>

<h3>Fengshan Coal Mine: Shanghai Merchants Organize Company; Mining Can Commence Shortly</h3>
<p>Following the news of the discovery of a coal mine in Fengshan, Yuyao, last month, Mr. Lu Shenkang, the manager of the Public Coal Company in this city, went to hire workers to conduct trial excavations, which have been successful. According to the estimation of the mining engineer accompanying Mr. Lu, the reserves are at least 300,000 tons. Mr. Lu has now returned to Shanghai to start raising capital and organizing a company, with Wang Xiaolai serving as chairman. Mining can commence shortly. It is rumored that a light railway will be laid from the iron ore area to Andong, directly reaching the Qiantang River, to facilitate large-scale transportation directly to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Bans Export of Piece Goods, Except Those Unrelated to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 14th] At the request of the Chinese government, the Hong Kong government has officially banned the export of all piece goods starting today. A Hong Kong government spokesperson stated that it was recently discovered that cotton yarn originally intended for relief purposes in China was smuggled from China to Shanghai, made into piece goods, and then transported to other places. The spokesperson added that the Chinese government requested Hong Kong to take measures to prevent this. The spokesperson pointed out that this ban will affect two types of piece goods: those made in China and those made from cotton yarn imported from China. Piece goods destined for Shanghai and unrelated to China are not subject to this ban.</p>
<h3>An Ji Securities Firm Officially Opens Today</h3>
<p>An Ji Securities Firm, Broker No. 224 of the Shanghai Securities Exchange, managed by Nie Linxiang and Lu Yousheng, specializing in securities trading, will officially open today. Messrs. Nie and Lu, in their securities business, have always been known for their stability and agility, and their keen observation of market trends and in-depth analysis have been particularly appreciated by clients. This collaboration can be described as complementary and mutually beneficial. The firm is located at No. 237 Securities Building, telephone 96161.</p>
<h3>Measures for Managing Export of Yarn and Cloth Under Consideration; Smuggling Routes to Southern China Exist by Land and Water</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] This reporter recently met with Mr. Liu Wenteng of the Textile Industry Management Committee to inquire about the progress of drafting measures for managing the export of yarn and cloth. According to him, the measures are currently being carefully reviewed. They are actively soliciting opinions from all parties to gather broad perspectives so that the management measures, once drafted, can be applicable in all aspects. He stated that before the domestic supply of yarn and cloth returns to normal, it is necessary to temporarily adopt management measures for export to maintain the principle of stable domestic prices for yarn and cloth. Once production increases and supply exceeds demand, not only will management not be imposed, but exports will be encouraged. As for the rumors of smuggling yarn and cloth to Southern China, the inside situation is quite complex. It is heard that some of the yarn and cloth exports from this city pass through customs, but some go through Hankou, reaching Guangzhou via the Yuehan Railway. Another part goes through the land route of Jinhua, transshipped to Guangxi. Neither of these routes passes through customs. The Committee is currently closely monitoring the situation. If necessary, personnel will be sent to the Guangzhou area to investigate the actual sales of yarn and cloth to clarify the situation.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Raises Prices; Maritime Administration Bureau to Intervene; Price Increase Must Be Submitted to the Ministry for Approval</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association has resolved to increase prices by 450% based on the original prices, effective from the 21st of this month. After this news spread, all parties expressed deep concern. According to a responsible person from the Maritime Administration Bureau, the industry has not yet submitted the price increase to the Bureau. Before approval is granted by the Ministry, it is not allowed to implement the increase without authorization according to regulations. The Bureau, with its related responsibilities, has decided to prohibit the increase unless an approved price increase order from the Ministry arrives, at which point implementation will be permitted.</p>
<h3>Draft Standardization Law</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] In order to promote the standardization of various goods, measurements, symbols, names, etc., the Ministry of Economic Affairs has drafted a Standardization Law and submitted it to the court. The draft has been jointly reviewed and passed by the Legal and Economic Affairs divisions. The draft is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The term "standard" in this law refers to a national standard formulated in accordance with the standard formulation procedures and universally observed throughout the country.</p>
<p>The aforementioned standard formulation procedures shall be determined by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>(1) Names, definitions, symbols, and constants of various units</p>
<p>(2) Standards for various qualities and dimensions</p>
<p>(3) Standards for various test methods</p>
<p>(4) Standards for various interchangeability performances</p>
<p>(5) Various safety standards</p>
<p>(6) Other standards to be observed</p>
<p>Article 3: The Ministry of Economic Affairs shall establish a Central Standards Bureau to handle various standardization matters.</p>
<p>Article 4: Standards universally observed throughout the country shall be formulated by the Central Standards Bureau in accordance with the standard formulation procedures and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval and promulgation.</p>
<p>Article 5: Products and methods that meet the standards shall be marked with a "(Standard)" symbol after being reviewed and approved by the Central Standards Bureau for identification.</p>
<p>Article 6: Goods manufactured, imported, or exported, and the test methods used, shall comply with the prescribed standards. The implementation measures shall be determined by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>Article 7: The Central Standards Bureau may submit various draft regulations to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval to promote the metric system standard.</p>
<p>Article 8: Anyone who uses fraudulent methods to request review or abuses the "(Standard)" symbol shall be prosecuted for fraud.</p>
<p>Article 9: This law shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Only Collect Inferior Banknotes; Issue Exquisite Banknotes in Exchange</h3>
<p>The Central Bank, due to the shortage of materials during the War of Resistance, had to adopt a single-paper-single-version method for the banknotes issued to meet the needs, resulting in a variety of styles circulating in the market. To simplify matters, it has decided to implement a system of only collecting and not issuing banknotes that are poorly printed or of inferior paper quality, gradually reducing the amount in circulation. It will select 1,000-yuan banknotes from inventory for replacement issuance to prevent counterfeiting and paper damage. As for the original set of 100-yuan, 200-yuan, 400-yuan, 500-yuan, 1,000-yuan, and 2,000-yuan banknotes, improvements are still difficult to achieve temporarily due to material limitations.</p>
<h3>Textile Control Committee to Re-inspect Private Factories Immediately</h3>
<p>After the expansion of the organization of the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, plans have also been drafted. The investigation of private textile factories previously conducted by the Ministry will be re-inspected. If any fictitious or improper circumstances are found, a report will be submitted to the Ministry for handling in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Valuation Keeps Rising; Factories Difficult to Take Over</h3>
<p>Regarding the government's preferential allocation of 22 factories to industrialists in the rear, due to inconsistencies among the three responsible parties—the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region, the Bureau for Handling Enemy and Puppet Property, and the Central Trust Bureau—the valuation of the factory bases has been changed three times, and the price has been increasing. The Sichuan-Guizhou Factory Association has specifically suggested convening a joint meeting to deliberate on the valuation and takeover procedures to reduce the difficulties in taking over the factories. Active consultations are currently underway with the relevant responsible authorities.</p>
<h3>Authorities to Uniformly Manage Money Exchange Businesses</h3>
<p>The money exchange business in this city has a long history, but its governing authority has not yet been approved. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to this and is preparing to uniformly manage it. At the same time, it is also planning to strictly regulate the business operations of the industry to avoid affecting financial security. Furthermore, as the money exchange business is not a formal money shop, any mixing of money shop licenses will be prohibited.</p>
<h3>Ex-dividend and Ex-rights: Minor Difficulties in Settlement</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>In a rush, I roughly flipped through the Operating Rules promulgated by the Stock Exchange. Article 57 states that "The trading of stocks on the day before the suspension of registration is ex-dividend trading. The ex-dividend or ex-rights shall be announced by the Exchange." As for bonds, simply cutting off the coupon is sufficient. However, for stocks, there are actually some complications. Past experience tells us that companies and manufacturers must first publish a notice before holding a shareholders' meeting to suspend transfer of ownership. The procedures for ex-dividend or ex-rights cannot be completed in just one day after the transaction. Some companies and manufacturers often deliberately want to boost the value of their stocks, locking up shareholders' shares for a longer period during the dividend or rights issuance period. If this article is followed, the seller on the day before will not actually be able to obtain the dividends or rights they are entitled to before settlement the next day. Regarding this technical issue, I wonder if the Exchange has made preparations to collect dividends or rights on behalf of the seller. Otherwise, difficulties will inevitably arise in settlement. I hope the Exchange will make a regulation soon.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers: Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Unmarried Cohabitation</p>
<p>Wan Yuan asks: Miss Jia is 20 years old and was engaged to Mr. Yi last fall. However, Mr. Yi does not engage in honest work. Since the engagement, Miss Jia has been seduced and fallen, and is now pregnant. Mr. Yi's parents secretly instigate, thinking they have succeeded. (1) Can Mr. Yi be arrested and prosecuted for luring away or seducing if Miss Jia's parents report to the police? (2) Can Mr. Yi's parents be charged for secretly instigating and using drugs? (3) If Mr. Yi intends to take Miss Jia to a distant place to get married, and Miss Jia's parents and the matchmaker do not attend, is this kind of marriage legal? (4) If Miss Jia has regretted and wants to return to her mother's home, but her parents believe she voluntarily left and refuse to let her return, is this legal?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui] (1) Luring away or seduction with the intention of adultery, according to Articles 242 and 241 of the Criminal Law, is limited to those who are under 20 years old. (2) According to Article 29, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, an instigator shall be punished according to the crime they instigated (but there must be definite evidence of instigation). Drug use is another issue. (3) According to Article 981 of the Civil Code, the marriage of a minor should obtain the consent of a legal representative, while adults are free. (4) Natural blood relations cannot be severed by artificial means.</p>
<p>(2) Applying for a Name Change</p>
<p>Zhu Xin Huan asks: (1) My friend graduated from a certain university in 1934. Now, because a relative has the same name and lives on the same street, there are many inconveniences. May I ask (1) whether an application can be made to the government to change the name based on the above circumstances? (2) To which government agency should the application be made, and what are the procedures? (3) I heard that the government before the war formulated special laws regulating the name change method, is this true? What is the name? In what legal publication is it contained?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui] Changing one's name is not a legal issue, it is an administrative procedure. You can check the administrative regulations of the National Government.</p>
<p>(3) Lineage Inheritance</p>
<p>Fan Jin Dao asks: I have three questions about lineage inheritance, please provide answers: (1) Besides an only heir to the lineage, there is still a thread of uncertainty, and there is no Zhaomu (equivalent generation) available to take over. Can the inheritance be confiscated and made public? (2) Originally, the Jia branch inherited the Yi branch. Now, because the Yi branch is thriving, but the Jia branch has died out, and the descendants of the Yi branch are closer in bloodline, can they inherit again? If a distant relative outside the fifth degree of mourning from the Jia branch interferes, is there any legal restraint? (3) How should one deal with someone who uses the name of inheritance but does not establish a separate household?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui] Lineage inheritance has been abolished since the implementation of the Inheritance Compilation of the Civil Code on May 5, 1931. However, it can still be applied if the inheritance began before that date. (1) If there is a daughter, she should inherit; otherwise, it should go to the national treasury. (2) If the deceased or the woman observing chastity is choosing a successor, they only need to be of the equivalent generation. If the relative meeting is choosing a successor, the acceptance is limited by the closeness and remoteness of relatives. (3) There is no connection whatsoever.</p>

<p>A Surviving Human Bomb</p>
<p>First, let me introduce myself. I am from Changlai Town, at the junction of Tonghai in Northern Jiangsu. Last month, in the "Liberated Area," I was ordered to charge the Three Factory. Two or three hundred vanguards, holding bamboo poles, tied with straw, raised fire and shouted to kill. They were followed by more than a hundred armed guards. It was quite impressive, with shouts of killing reaching the sky, fulfilling the greatest responsibility of democracy. Fortunately, the National Army inside the factory did not pay attention, so all the human bombs escaped early. Offering wives and sisters was also out of the question. Now, everywhere is blocked, and there is no way to escape! The purpose of the blockade is nothing more than to have us continue to perform the spirit of democracy. May I ask Mr. Communist Party, is it permissible for me to escape this time? Can I or can't I?</p>
<p>I have been a human bomb, fortunately not detonated. The number of human bombs that cannot escape will be countless. This kind of democracy is really a bit scary! (Shi Tingrong)</p>
<p>Traitors Who Kill Without Bloodshed</p>
<p>Editor: I am a small employee in a copper and tin store. During the enemy puppet era, there were many treacherous merchants in our industry and in hardware stores who colluded with the enemy's military department and Yangxing such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi, using mercury, copper, tin, hardware, etc. and melting down copper coins in large quantities to provide resources to the enemy, doing things that harmed the country and killed people without bloodshed, earning a lot of sinful money.</p>
<p>After the victory, many political traitors were imprisoned or tried to prove the law with their own bodies, but these economic traitors who supplied military goods to the enemy (complete traitors) were still free, some living as secluded in the seas, hoarding goods for speculation, and smuggling foreign goods without paying taxes. Their past crimes are even worse than political traitors. So, I hope the authorities will investigate the account books of all copper and tin stores in the past (please note that they have false account books) or check the import and export books of the enemy Yangxing and the Zhengjin Bank. I think it will be possible to find out the truth.</p>
<p>The copper and tin industry is roughly divided into two gangs: the Nanjing gang and the Shaoxing gang. Some have fled to escape punishment, but are still living as secluded in the seas, and recently, there are still some who are doing speculative businesses on a large scale. We hope that the authorities will immediately send personnel to secretly investigate to clarify the truth and alert traitors. (Ye Liqing)</p>
<p>Punishing Traitors Is Transformed Into a Corrupt Policy</p>
<p>Editor: It is welcomed by merchants and civilians that the government formally punishes real traitors. Now in recovered areas, whether cities or towns, reporting traitors is an opportunity to profit and seek revenge! Although national law is impartial, a lawsuit against a suspected traitor will lead to family ruin and death even if he is declared innocent! The civilians who cannot afford to flee from the occupied areas are all at risk of being reported. The people are confused. Does the government care about innocent civilians in the occupied areas (except for Communists) and have a compassionate solution? (Reader Xiang Baiyun)</p>
<h3>On Behalf of Mailing</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Wang Tairan: Recently, we received a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating: "Your institution's letter of August 23, forwarding reader Wang's letter, on the matter of not releasing relief materials, has been copied and sent to the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference for verification." This is a reply.</p>
<p>Li Zheng: Please inform us of the name of the school you were admitted to.</p>
<p>Reply to a certain gentleman on Penglai Road: The Shanghai Municipal Government replied regarding the matter of the Yinhang Airport land being occupied: "The land in this case is currently undergoing requisition procedures. The letter in advance has been approved, and a corresponding reply is hereby made. Please check and inform."</p>
<p>Reply to a certain gentleman: Regarding the matter of the house being forcibly occupied, the First Pacification District Headquarters replied: "The matter has been telegraphed to the 17th Army Commander for investigation." Special reply.</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Hua: Magistrate Li of Jinshan County wrote: "During the period when this county was occupied, the enemy built a monument to the Tamabe Unit's loyal souls in the public stadium. After the victory, it should have been demolished early to clear the shame. The reason for the delay is that the war-resistant soldiers and civilians in the local area suffered extremely heavy sacrifices at the beginning of the occupation. It is planned to be converted into a monument to the martyrs who died in the war of resistance for a long time. The approval was given in the previous letter, except that the police were ordered to immediately demolish the monument. A corresponding reply is hereby made, and please convey it."</p>
<p>Reply to Ling Qun: China Middle School wrote: (Excerpt) Our school was once used as a refugee shelter and occupied by retreating troops from the South City during the War of Resistance, causing significant losses. After the victory, there must be a considerable recovery, so a small enrollment fee is collected from new students for equipment. If our school is indeed using this mentality to generate revenue, why not collect from all 700 students instead of just charging this small amount of 5,000 yuan from over one hundred new students? (Excerpt)</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Zhong Jianzhi: Rongchang Wool Company replied to our letter: We received your letter. The manuscript of Zhong Jianzhi from Shaolou Town differs greatly from the facts. When Mr. Jin came to our store to purchase goods, the staff in charge explained that the Empress and Double Cat were the same quality and the price was the same. If he thought it was not suitable, he could exchange it. Later, Mr. Jin sent a letter expressing dissatisfaction. Our company immediately sent a letter of explanation and apologized to him. It is a pity that Mr. Zhong did not come to negotiate again. Our company is still waiting for Mr. Zhong to come and exchange for goods of the same price, which can be resolved satisfactorily.</p>

<h3>How to Deal with Supervisors</h3>
<p>— Fei Wen</p>
<p>If we want to contact supervisors - the principals of an industrial or commercial enterprise - regarding business, we must possess the following conditions:</p>
<p>(1) We must consult with them on decided matters, not ask them to decide matters.</p>
<p>(2) We must discuss principles with them, not present those trivial details.</p>
<p>(3) Speak simply, directly, clearly, and completely.</p>
<p>(4) Be well prepared.</p>
<p>(5) Be concise, not long-winded.</p>
<p>At the same time, a supervisor often has the following characteristics. Conversely, if you want to become a supervisor, you must possess the following characteristics:</p>
<p>(1) Supervisors plan everything in advance, rather than digging a well when they are thirsty.</p>
<p>(2) Supervisors base their decisions on facts and figures.</p>
<p>(3) Supervisors like methods that can improve work efficiency and plans that can increase sales.</p>
<p>(4) Supervisors also like to research ways to promote labor-management cooperation.</p>
<p>(5) When considering things, supervisors think of the whole picture rather than piecemeal.</p>
<p>(6) A supervisor's thoughts are concentrated on the following departments:</p>
<p>A. Production, B. Sales, C. Economic dispatching, D. Management</p>
<h3>The Revival of the British Textile Industry</h3>
<p>— Original by Wilter Hill, Abridged and Translated by Deng Shaoqiu</p>
<p>Cotton is indeed the most important textile raw material in the world according to quantitative standards, because cotton fabrics are used widely and frequently. If judged by other standards, cotton should still take precedence, and no other natural or man-made fiber can match it. Therefore, Britain and its colonies are the countries that produce the most cotton and cotton fabrics in the world, and the prosperity of the textile industry has a close relationship with the entire future of Britain.</p>
<p>Before the Second World War, the textile industry naturally occupied the most important position in British export trade. In 1936, the total value of British textile exports was as high as five million pounds, and in 1937 it increased further to sixty-eight million five hundred thousand pounds. From this, it can be seen that the British government and public attach great importance to the revival of the textile industry.</p>
<p>Labor and Technology</p>
<p>However, the most serious problem for the British textile industry after the war is the current or short-term difficulty: the shortage of production. Most of the workers were conscripted into the war or transferred to the military industry. Before the war, there were as many as 500,000 workers, but now it has shrunk to less than half. As a result, not only is it impossible to increase the export volume of textiles, but also it is not enough to supply the clothing needs of the British people. In other words, the first step for Britain to revive its textile industry after the war is how to increase the number of textile workers. However, there are two difficulties: (A) The wages in the military industry are higher than those in the textile industry, so the workers who were transferred to the military industry before are unwilling to return to the textile industry. (B) After serving in the military industry, textile workers are accustomed to the comfortable environment and generous treatment of aircraft and other modern industries, and they may not be willing to return to their old jobs.</p>
<p>However, this difficulty is easy to solve. The most difficult problem for the British textile industry today is the technical problem. After the war, in October last year and April and May this year, the British textile industry labor and management delegations visited the United States three times to investigate the current situation of the American textile industry, and found that the manufacturing methods and equipment of the domestic textile industry were far inferior to those of the United States. Therefore, they attach great importance to this, because during the war, the British textile industry had repeatedly suffered from dumping in the American and Chinese domestic and foreign markets, and its international trade volume had declined. If this continues, the future will be unimaginable. Therefore, the magnates of the British textile industry collectively requested government assistance to discuss how to save the bankrupt British textile industry. From January to June this year, after their efforts, the British textile industry has embarked on a prosperous path again.</p>
<p>Labor-Management Cooperation</p>
<p>The first countermeasure they agreed on was how to increase the number of textile workers. The labor and management sides of the British textile industry selected representatives to form a committee to study how to increase wages and improve environmental protection machinery to attract workers. Therefore, since February this year, the number of workers has increased to more than 400,000, and the production volume is also increasing day by day, but it is still far from the pre-war level, and it is even further away from their post-war plan to monopolize the entire world textile market.</p>
<p>Then they discussed the second countermeasure. The labor and management sides suggested the following points: (A) Stabilize production, (B) Work in shifts, (C) Labor-management cooperation, (D) Merge textiles, and renovate factories. The most important thing is to meet the economic principles of mass production. From the technology of textiles, we want a thorough reform, merge work steps, concentrate production capacity, and strive to meet the standards of long-term production. In addition, labor and management must cooperate closely to improve work efficiency.</p>
<p>In other aspects, in order to improve the quality of British textiles, it is planned to gradually adopt modern machinery and implement a day and night shift system to fully utilize new equipment. Moreover, the British textile industry jointly established a textile product research institute in April this year, hiring a number of famous textile experts from the United States and Britain, who have been constantly researching the improvement of products day and night. After more than two months of research, British textiles have now achieved the following results.</p>
<p>Research Work</p>
<p>Researchers used new tools to review the molecular arrangement of textile fibers to improve their fiber properties. At present, the British textile industry can make textiles non-shrinking, moth-proof, and waterproof, make their surface smooth like fine linen or rayon, and also make their colors pure white. Moreover, two harmonious colors can be dyed in one procedure. The above-mentioned manufacturing methods have been widely adopted by various textile factories in Britain. For example, the non-shrinking procedure has been adopted for cotton and wool knitted clothing, and it is rumored that this new invention has saved the British millions of pounds in expenses.</p>
<p>According to the opinions of the British textile industry spokesperson, a new textile product will appear in Britain in the future, which is neither cotton fabric, nor woollen cloth, nor silk fabric, but a textile product that is between the three. Britain has recently produced a cotton bed sheet and a woollen shirt, which are warm, comfortable, and gorgeous. At first glance, it looks like linen. And recently, since February, British textile products have had a unique brilliance, dazzling and radiant, just like silk, which is truly rare and valuable.</p>
<p>However, the British textile industry is still not satisfied. In recent months, representatives of the textile industry in various parts of Britain have been discussing and researching the outline of future plans. British textiles will adopt a standard mark to indicate the different sources and qualities of various textiles. In order to ensure that cotton, wool, and various textile raw materials are not in short supply, the British government has increased the tariff rate on cotton and wool produced in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa from six pence per bundle to two shillings per bundle. Therefore, in this situation, the new trends in the British textile industry will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the development of the future.</p>
<h3>Chinese Agricultural Production and Marketing</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhong Deqi</p>
<p>"Production" and "Distribution" are the two major problems of economics, especially important in agriculture. The author of this article, W. M. Curtiss, is a famous American agricultural economist who came to China in 1937 and taught in the Department of Agricultural Economics at Jinling University. This article emphasizes the importance of "agricultural production and marketing" in China in the future. Therefore, although it was written to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Department of Agricultural Economics at Jinling University, it can also be used as a reference for those who study Chinese agricultural economic problems. Translator's note. August 2.</p>
<p>The Department of Agricultural Economics at Jinling University has made significant progress in farm management, prices, and land economics in the past 25 years. I predict that in the future, it will show even greater attention to agricultural production and marketing.</p>
<p>In the history of agricultural education and agricultural research in the United States, it has been shown that a great deal of effort has been put into production. This is as it should be. In recent years, more attention has been focused on distribution (Translator's note: including various processes in distribution). In the United States, when consumers buy agricultural products in the market, half of the money they pay goes to the producers of the products, and half is consumed in the distribution process. The more industrialized a country becomes, the more important the distribution of edible products becomes.</p>
<p>In an agricultural primitive country, its fields are mostly self-sufficient type (Self Sufficient Type), and the distribution problem is less important. But if a country relies on 20% of its population to produce to supply the whole country, then the distribution problem is particularly important, and the interests of both producers and consumers are equally threatened.</p>
<p>As a country becomes more urbanized and industrialized, the result is that the rural population is more controlled by the distribution system. When a country's economic situation rises and falls, the extent to which farmers' income rises and falls is very large, because distribution costs are between production and consumers and are relatively fixed. Therefore, when a slump comes, the portion of money that farmers get from consumers may drop from an average of 60%, resulting in the bankruptcy of the entire farmer.</p>
<p>The goal of studying marketing should be to simultaneously increase the interests of producers and consumers, and this goal is not achieved by making producers take more money from consumers on production costs, but rather by improving distribution efficiency to benefit both parties. This goal should be to reduce the labor consumption and costs of production, so that distribution and consumption can both benefit more.</p>
<p>When China becomes more highly industrialized and agricultural production becomes a small part of the national economy, agricultural production and marketing will become even more important; therefore, the study of agricultural production and marketing must be the most important work in the work of a progressive economics department.</p>
<h3>Yizhi Tractor</h3>
<p>— Translated from the New York Times Weekly</p>
<p>Although gasoline tractors are not the most important agricultural machinery invention, they may be the most dramatic. Due to its enormous power, it has greatly increased the efficiency of combine harvesters. During the First World War, the tractor transformed the Great Plains into an unexpected granary. The tillage time required for one acre of wheat was greatly reduced due to the use of tractors, and at the same time, the area of each field was also expanded. After the First World War, many veterans found that they were no longer needed to participate in farming, so they were forced to join the unemployment ranks in 1921.</p>
<p>Mechanized wheat farming continued to develop after the First World War. A total of 115,000 combines were manufactured from 1926 to 1930, while the production volume of combines in the previous five years was only 25,000. By 1938, 90% of the wheat in Kansas was harvested using combines.</p>
<p>In the ten years before the Second World War, the number of tractors in American rural areas almost doubled. In 1940, there were almost 1.6 million tractors in use in the United States. That was the year of the Great Depression, and buying a tractor was almost the most important move in an ordinary farmer's life. Therefore, there were indeed some forces that promoted agricultural mechanization, because if a farmer's financial ability was not enough to purchase a tractor in installments, he could mortgage his land to purchase a tractor. There are now 2 million tractors on American farmland. These tractors have a huge impact on the consolidation of land ownership, because mechanically powered equipment is suitable for use on large-scale farmland. On the one hand, mechanical equipment can do more work, and on the other hand, more investment also hopes to get greater profits. In the past, a farmer could not do much work, but now each farmer can do more than four times as much work. Many landlords own land that is scattered, and several fields may be several miles apart, but today farmers can use rubber-wheeled tractors, so the distance factor is no longer as important as it used to be.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Business Administration</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Introduction to Business Administration is a series of articles, which is not easy to understand in the middle. The article was originally an introduction, followed by several principles. What is currently being discussed are various issues related to "production machinery." Each issue will start a new section in the future to facilitate readers' clipping and preservation.</p>
<p>D. Supervision of Work</p>
<p>In the process of manufacturing work, it is necessary to supervise it at any time. This supervision work can be divided into two types:</p>
<p>A. Supervision during work</p>
<p>B. Inspection during the manufacturing process of goods</p>
<p>The first type of work is easy to understand. For example, when we build a house, we must hire a supervisor to monitor the progress of the work. His responsibility is to prevent workers from being lazy and construction companies from cutting corners.</p>
<p>Regarding this aspect, there can be two methods:</p>
<p>The first method is to use our eyes to do the monitoring work. The foreman in the factory is the person responsible for this work. He must see whether the workers are lazy during working hours or whether they are working below standard. If he finds anything, he will immediately correct it so that it does not continue to be wrong.</p>
<p>The second method is to use recording methods, such as attendance. Each worker has a card. When going to work, he punches the time clock. The same is true when leaving work. Also, there are records of the work produced every day. This method can not only allow the director of a department to see the worker's performance, but also allow the company's authorities to see the factory's progress after statistical work. For example, if we run a farm with tens of thousands of cows, then each cow has a number, and there can be a statistic for how much milk is produced every day. The owner of a milk company can know everything about the cows without entering the cow farm—their production, their health, and their consumption.</p>
<p>The authorities of a company are not allowed to inspect everywhere all day long, so recording and statistical methods are the most able to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Usually, the above two types of work are carried out simultaneously.</p>
<p>Regarding the inspection of goods, that has a great impact on the future of the goods and must be handled seriously. I have visited the General Electric Edison Bulb Factory. Every step they make has to be inspected. Before the packaging is properly shipped out of the factory, a few are also drawn out for inspection to see if they meet the standards. For example, before drugs are shipped out of the factory, they must also undergo many inspections. Especially for the manufacture of drugs for injection, many pharmaceutical factories, in order to be cautious and clarify responsibilities, all those responsible for the inspection must sign and seal on a slip of paper attached to the medicine box.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of editing and publishing books, proofreading is also a kind of inspection work—checking for errors. Bookstore companies like the Commercial Press and World Book Company once attached the names of the proofreaders to the copyright page for a time. This move also meant caution.</p>

<h3>Music and Dreams</h3>
<p>— Sun Yu</p>
<p>In a book of essays, there is an article that mentions Jin music. The author said: "Music does not need to describe and carve like painting and writing, but what pictures cannot describe and what words cannot convey, music can fully express. What music gives people is the highest realm of beauty that the soul can feel, because the beauty of music is extremely abstract, and its expression can be broader and deeper, without limitations. It is a mistake to judge the appreciation of Jin music based on the associations and images it evokes." The beauty of music is extremely abstract. I think it would be more accurate to say that it is close to dreams. Music art often has a deep relationship with dreams; the famous French symphonist Berlioz (1803-1869) composed the "Fantastic Symphony," which fully depicts the scene of dreams. It is said that Berlioz was heartbroken and fell into deep depression. In that "Fantastic Symphony," he described killing his lover in his dream and seeing many gorgeous scenes and the dance of witches.</p>
<p>"It is a mistake to judge the appreciation of music based on the associations and images it evokes." I think this sentence is correct, because the alienation of musical images is greater than that of painting and other arts. Music can never grasp a clear image. You say that this section of music describes the setting sun, but why can't it also describe the moon setting in the west or the sorrow of being lovelorn? This is because sound can describe the atmosphere, such as excitement and sadness, but cannot describe things. (i.e., clear images.) The same text about music also says: "When appreciating a high-level music, I only feel intoxicated and immersed in it, forgetting the world and myself, and being guided by the god of music into the infinite realm of supreme beauty." I think music is just pure music, nothing else. In fact, being intoxicated and immersed in music is like being intoxicated in a dream, and this supreme and beautiful realm is both joy and sorrow. Perhaps this feeling is just far-fetched.</p>
<h3>On the Jialing River</h3>
<p>— Carved by Renfeng</p>
<h3>Musing</h3>
<p>— Han Yang</p>
<p>Those who have seen the Qiantang River tide know how magnificent and surging it is, how captivating its momentum. But I always feel it's not as good as the delicate sea tide striking the rocky shore, producing subtle and winding sounds.</p>
<p>One year, I spent some time in a small coastal city in Shandong. Behind my residence was the sea, an endless expanse of blue. Opening the back window allowed the briny sea breeze to blow freely on my face, on the potted flowers I kept on my desk, and on my whole heart. It wasn't so much a feeling of joy as it was of intoxication; indeed, the salty sea breeze, neither fierce nor weak, containing a kind of strength, was truly something with emotion. Every time I stood at the window, I thought that it wasn't I who was receiving the sea breeze's favor, but that it was swallowing me up. It truly seeped into my blood like wine.</p>
<p>But even more intoxicating than the sea breeze was the sound of the tide every evening and early morning. The sea is so vast that when the tide rises, it makes no particular splash, like a wise and profound person whose emotions, even when surging, remain unmoved, leaving us unable to fathom their depths. The only news reporting the tide's arrival is the delicate murmur, beating in slow rhythm, gently crashing on the rocky shore. That sound is like a low whisper, like repeated reminders, like a poet savoring his soaring imagination, like a lover using tender words to knock on the other's heart, like… No, I have no appropriate words to compare it to, only feeling that it is so full of emotions, endlessly lingering. It makes me melancholy, makes me dreamy, awakens me from sleep, and allows me to create more beautiful, fantastic, thrilling, and boundless dreams.</p>
<p>From then on, I learned how to live, learned how to settle my own emotions.</p>
<p>Human nature's relationship to life is probably like the soul's mastery over a person. A person without a soul doesn't know how to nourish their own heart with human nature. Even if the material conditions are exceptionally abundant, they still won't know how to live.</p>
<p>Thus, the meaning of so-called life lies in creating an atmosphere of human interest, and then receiving the various flavors of sweetness and bitterness it gives us. We live simply because we live, so what reason do we have to demand a better situation? Therefore, true living should start from within, from the inside out and then back inward. Only from these places can the true manifestation of human nature be found.</p>
<p>Although sometimes I also admire a kind of ardent and straightforward emotion, such as crying loudly for a while when heartbroken, or singing or shouting as much as possible when happy, it really has a liberating effect on our lives. But human strength is limited; using it too much at once, or using it slowly over a long period, results in the same amount of energy expended in our lives. The difference lies in the effect on life. On our "life phase," especially in modern times, the distress of life, which is also the distress of humanity, is unanimously acknowledged by everyone who has questioned their own soul. Therefore, I must say that, at least in this current stage, a true "optimist" does not exist. Because the various aspects of romance on the stage of life still lack the conditions to make us produce true "optimists." Nowadays, some people in society claim to be "optimists," enjoying themselves regardless of everything, letting music, alcohol, and neon lights play with their senses. In reality, they don't understand optimism, they are just, as Hakuson Kushida said, mocking life. They don't use their "true heart" to respond to life, but instead hold a playful attitude, which is indeed another manifestation of "nihilism." Nothing is more tragic than a dead heart. I always feel that those who put life and their own heart at a great distance, and who have even lost the ability to welcome "doubt," have some indescribable sadness. In addition, there is another type of person who, with a belly full of tears, abnormally uses enjoyment to numb themselves. I recently met such a friend who boldly mocks life, mocks the people around her and herself, but I notice that her emotions, which are aroused from time to time, often make her cry for no apparent reason. This is naturally full of "human interest," naturally "human," but for some reason, I still feel that it is not a normal life. All abnormal lives are deformed, extreme, and pitiful. After a burst of joy and excessive tension, it is not difficult to imagine what follows. Therefore, I would rather prefer and admire a higher and greater wisdom, an immeasurable wit sufficient to lead emotions to follow a normal human nature.</p>
<p>The sea is too vast, so the tide is not obvious; the mouth of the Qiantang River is large among rivers, but compared to the sea, it is much smaller. Therefore, the tide that seems insignificant in the sea becomes surging and agitated once it enters the mouth of the Qiantang River. The tide is emotion, it is "human nature." The sea does not reject it, but being able to integrate it to the point of "insignificance" is the sea's true greatness.</p>
<p>People with emotion but lacking wit often tend to be superficial and vulgar; people with reason but lacking emotion often tend to be cunning and cold. In order to achieve a perfect attitude towards life, in order to nourish one's own heart with "human interest," it is necessary to add wit to emotion and integrate the two into one. The loveliness of "human nature" requires both emotion and wit; the greatness of "human nature" can only be truly manifested after possessing both "witty emotions" and "emotional wit."</p>
<p>The charm of emotion can only be tasted from "lingering." Loud crying is never as heartbreaking as quiet sobbing; unrestrained laughter is never as moving as a knowing smile. This is the same principle as the surging tide in the Qiantang River being inferior to the fragmented sound of the waves striking the rocky shore. Hiding emotion deep in the heart, not wasting it or consuming it, and then, at the appropriate time, carefully taking out a portion, just a part of it, and making it appear wearing a coat of wit, that is undoubtedly the most lovely state on the "life" stage. So-called "humor," so-called "human nature," should refer to this. People do not need any "satisfaction," what people need is a kind of "lingering," a kind of lingering and repeated charm to infinity. Just as we would never want to swallow any delicious food in one gulp, but would rather hold a small portion in our mouth and chew it repeatedly. Blandness is not good, but too much or too intense flavor, or too much satisfaction, will also make people tired. Therefore, the Chinese pay attention to "tea tasting" and abhor "gulping it down," and life is the same way. Emotion is the deliciousness of life, but those who swallow it whole or those who greedily eat a little and want to eat enough are no different from harming themselves and depriving themselves of the meaning of life. They are the ones who understand life the least.</p>
<p>Understanding this, we should understand the source of literature and art, etc. Hakuson Kushida said that the appreciation of literature is based on "one's own discovery," that is, readers appreciate a work in order to discover themselves from it. I fully agree with this view. The essence of "life" is actually just an appreciation of the self of life. What can make people produce "self-appreciation of life" is the most "human" place, and also the most lingering place. The more it is like this, the more people can feel the true existence of life, and the more they have the leisure to appreciate it. Literature and art probably start from here. The reason why tragedy is more popular than comedy is because emotions are vented too quickly, "satisfaction" closes the door of "lingering" and ends the flow of "human nature." Any story, any image, once it reaches the step of "satisfaction," is finished, it is useless, and it will no longer arouse people's interest. A couple, if they have a smooth union and live happily together, will not become a moving story, and can never become the subject of a novel, because there is a lack of expression of "human nature" here, and it cannot make others discover "themselves." But if a marital change occurs between him and her, people will immediately pay attention, their life will immediately become "story-like," because they will only then have to display the most real "human nature" they possess, which also contains the life of others.</p>
<p>"The art of life" should be sought here. A person who is good at managing his own life should, like a novelist seeking moving themes everywhere, also seek everywhere for the content of life that is sufficient to make emotions linger. The loveliness of life, the enjoyment of life, must be here, I firmly believe.</p>
<p>The melody in music, the quivering tone in poetry, the use of light in painting, aren't they all showing the ability of art in "lingering"? Therefore, I want to say: the essence of art is a kind of "lingering," but "lingering" is not the independence of art, it is completely in response to people's demands for life.</p>
<p>A normal life should be in line with the requirements of art, it should be a lingering "self-appreciation" of life.</p>
<p>This truth is what the sea told me. Artists, I think they all understand this principle, but they just haven't clearly pointed it out.</p>
<p>The great 19th-century writer Leo Tolstoy had this experience. When he lived in Yasnaya Polyana in his later years, he hired a young music teacher for his son to learn the violin, and every night he played Beethoven's famous pieces. Unexpectedly, the great writer was deeply moved by Beethoven's music. Every evening, he listened to the young musician's performance with tears in his eyes. Sometimes, he was so excited that he couldn't sit still, and he opened the window to breathe the outside air. As a result, he wrote a novel called "The Kreutzer Sonata," which was his attack on modern marriage after listening to Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata. The matter seems strange, that Tolstoy would think of the hypocrisy of the marriage system from the emotion of music. But if you understand the principles I mentioned earlier, you will think it is a very natural result and not strange at all.</p>
<p>The essence of "love," like art, is just a kind of "lingering," a kind of "lingering of life." In the process of love between men and women, their hearts are completely artistic. They constantly discover themselves and enjoy the joy of "self-appreciation of life" from the baptism of each other's love. Therefore, a person only feels the extraordinariness and preciousness of their own life when leaning on their lover's chest. The "love" received from a lover is a beautiful mirror, it not only allows you to recognize your own tenderness, soft heart, hearing, and wisdom, not only makes you coquettish like a child, with nerves as sensitive as a hunting dog, and thoughts as meticulous as a goblin, but it can also make you perceive some latent heat and the truth of human nature hidden in your heart that you would not normally perceive. Therefore, "love" is a job, an artistic job. When you fall in love with someone, this job begins, you are doing the "excavation" of the "soul." On the one hand, you are excavating the soul of your lover, but on the other hand, you are becoming more aware of yourself because your soul is being excavated by your lover, and there is infinite "lingering" in between. That's why I often say: "Love is an art." Lovers use a force of "love" that integrates high wit and high skill to explore each other's souls, which is exactly the same as music using melody, poetry using trembling, and painting using light and line to explore people's souls. Moreover, the meaning of accepting each other's "love" is just like what we accept from music, poetry, painting, novels, etc. The only joy lies in "one's own discovery," in the "self-appreciation of life." Therefore, "love" is the purer the better, it must be removed from the demands and satisfaction of carnal desires in order to reach the realm of art. "Love" is the more tortuous the better, the more repeated and lingering to infinity the better, the reason is just like this.</p>
<p>But society does not allow people to enjoy the happiness of "love" for a long time, the marriage system is saying that after lovers have gone through a period of lingering, they should end it, and then he and she must marry. Marriage is a kind of "satisfaction," and it is precisely the cessation of the work of "excavating the soul," it is actually what is generally said to be the "tomb of love." A pair of lovers, if they always maintain the form of "love," the preparation of each other's souls is endless, as if both sides have infinite treasures, constantly enticing you to explore and yet inexhaustible, then the lingering of love will be endless. But they got married, once they got married, they both said, "This is all I have, everything is here, take it quickly." Then "love" is buried. Lovers are the union of souls, couples are the union of society, and our present society cannot become "couples" without killing "lovers." This is the truth that Tolstoy discovered: "Modern marriage is completely hypocritical"!</p>
<p>Beethoven's "Kreutzer Sonata," I have not yet had the blessing to hear, but I can always imagine that it is endlessly lingering. We need the lingering of life, we need the "soul" to be "excavated," so we love music, we love all art. But the depth of our lives, there are some places that art is also powerless to excavate, only leaning on the lover's chest can it be accomplished, so we are even more in demand of the love between the sexes. Therefore, Tolstoy felt from the "lingering" of "Kreutzer Sonata" that the lingering of "love" is indispensable, and therefore was indignant at the hypocrisy of modern marriage in burying "love." Isn't this path very natural? Isn't it proving the meaning of "life" that I said above?</p>
<h3>Worldliness</h3>
<p>— Ke Feng</p>
<p>Have you had this experience? Strolling alone on a deserted street, shrouding a weary mood in the twilight's ambiguity; or bearing some pointless urgency, hurrying along a noisy sidewalk, when suddenly, a pair of widened eyes fix on you. They stare for a moment, and then a pair of sweaty hands cling tightly together – an exchange of heat, nerves vibrating, yet each remains speechless.</p>
<p>This wouldn't stem from a contrived affectation. You might say, "No one's emotions are as easily stirred or as prone to overflow as they once were." Indeed, after these years of turbulence, of hardships and trials, no one knows where to begin talking!</p>
<p>My friend and I faced each other in such silence. When our eyes met again, he smiled. I suddenly felt empty. The twitch of his mouth, the crinkle of his eyes – everything was familiar to me, but that smile no longer held the brightness of a "May day." Naturally, I smiled too, a touch of astringency on the tip of my tongue. My smile was bitter as well.</p>
<p>"You've aged!"</p>
<p>But my friend had a more subtle way of putting it: "Looking at your face, you've become much more worldly."</p>
<p>"Much more worldly!" This should be considered a more "worldly" way of speaking. I couldn't help but shudder.</p>
<p>Preserving the sins learned furtively while adrift in the sea of humanity; replacing assistance and compassion with competition and oppression; exchanging lies and deception for the good intentions of others; painting conscience in various colors, selling it off piece by piece; leading people to mistake white for black, and black for white; housing a ghost in one's own shell as a substitute for one's soul... These, these are signs of being "much more worldly"?</p>
<p>To superiors, showing servile deference, obsequious flattery; to subordinates, displaying authoritarian power, arrogant demeanor; sketching out a complete repertoire of pleading, ingratiating, flattering, bootlicking, hypocritical benevolence, selfish generosity, or frightening, cruel, and poisonous faces, to be used at any time; memorizing an entire set of lines, comparing the world to a stage, painstakingly training oneself to become an even more outstanding character than the famous actors on stage. Does this also belong to being "worldly"?</p>
<p>More pitiful are those who tremble fearfully in the dog-eat-dog world, following the shadows of others, saying black is black and white is white; daring neither to laugh loudly nor to cry freely; having no share in joy, and not daring to utter a word of resentment. They shut their souls in tightly sealed iron cages, allowing them to become numb, to die; they are even more preoccupied with watching the expressions of others, for the faces of others are the foundation of their own "personality." Is there "worldliness" here, too?</p>
<p>"Your face reveals a deep worldliness."</p>
<p>Is it like an old gun, the face stained with smoke that cannot be concealed?</p>
<p>Those who initially thought they were learning to swim and were pleased with themselves in the ups and downs of the world, you have only contracted a body full of viruses, stained with a body full of sins!</p>
<p>"Looking at your face, you've become much more worldly." I look at my friend, he too has aged.</p>
<p>Beneath those "worldlinesses," youth is eroded, and the soul is darkened. Grasping my friend's hand tightly, my nerves vibrating, I felt us both shuddering.</p>
<p>We could only offer a bitter smile.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 34</p>
<p>Ping: Because national affairs are becoming increasingly urgent, Chairman Wei is summoning national worthies to Lushan for talks to discuss how to deal with the current situation.</p>
<p>Xin: According to my intelligence in Nanjing, the Jiang regime is ambitious and wants to confront me on a large scale. Now it is actively convening a military conference in Lushan. The intention to make war is very clear. O Imperial Army, purchasing and conscripting from China, now is the time! For the straw men of China to oppose my illustrious Imperial Army is no different than hitting a rock with an egg.</p>
<p>Ping: My Chairman secretly ordered Song Zheyuan on the 16th to quickly resolve the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin and relocate to Baoding to prepare for war.</p>
<p>Xin: The General Staff Headquarters of the Expeditionary Army secretly ordered that Nanjing intends to instigate Commander Song to act in unison. Now that Song in Tianjin has shown accord with my Kiyoshi Katsuki's military headquarters, I am making further demands and will not stop until my goal is achieved.</p>
<p>Ping: The Chairman issued an important statement on the current situation: (1) The National Government's foreign policy is to seek self-preservation internally and common interest externally, and to always cherish peace; (2) Lugou Bridge is the gateway to Beiping. The ability to end the Lugou Bridge Incident is the boundary of the final juncture; (3) When it comes to the final juncture, there is only resolute sacrifice, but I am only preparing for war, not seeking war; (4) Before peace is despaired of, I always hope for a peaceful solution, but I must adhere to the four minimum conditions: 1. Any solution must not infringe on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity; 2. The administrative organization of Hebei and Chahar must not undergo any illegal changes; 3. Local officials appointed by the Central Government, such as Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Hebei and Chahar, cannot be removed at anyone's request; 4. The area where the 29th Army is currently stationed cannot be subject to any restrictions.</p>
<p>Xin: The Nanjing regime has now launched a political and propaganda offensive, and its intention is to realize a policy of intimidation and to separate me from the relationship between the administration of Hebei and Chahar. In any case, I must still move forward without hesitation to implement the established policy of my cabinet chief. Commander Song Zheyuan's friendly actions towards me in Beiping today (July 19) show that Nanjing's alienation tactics are just the worries of mediocre people. …</p>
<p>Looking at the above telegrams in comparison, one can know the positions of Japan and us on the current situation that day: Japan was determined to implement aggression in order to realize the dream of controlling Greater East Asia; although we said that it had reached the final juncture, we still demanded peace and that it not infringe on our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>On this day, I inquired about the news of He'er from Changxindian twice in secret ways. The reply was always vague and asked me to return to my station quickly. Mr. W was of course very concerned about He'er's actions and the news of the "Seven Secret Machines." So in the evening, he no longer insisted on staying and let me set off to return to the station.</p>
<p>From Beiping to Changxindian, it is only a twenty or thirty minute train ride. It seems easy to find a way to return to Changxindian. Unfortunately, at this time, due to repeated armed conflicts between Japan and us, trains could no longer move freely. Furthermore, my whereabouts must not be known by the Japanese special service, because the Changxindian power station has not been disclosed to any Japanese agency. But I am anxious to return to my station, which is an ironclad fact.</p>
<p>Now there are only two paths for me to take. First, explore and advance step by step, taking one step and seeing what happens. If problems arise, deal with them as they come. Second, go to the Japanese special service branch in Beiping, look for opportunities, and apply one or two of the fifteen emergency methods we agreed upon with He'er to try my luck. Finally, I decided to take the second path; because the first path might not be able to reach my destination as desired, and it is more dangerous.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Beiping, at the Japanese Special Service Branch – this unprecedented terror-manufacturing center – I met the local head using some name of the General Staff Headquarters. (The so-called tool of a certain name is just a headquarters badge and a verbally stated identity – of course, a temporary identity was created.) The situation of this meeting between the two sides is like the situation of a high official of the former Qing Dynasty patrolling and overriding the local officials. The local officials at the time had no way and did not dare to explore the authenticity of the Beijing officials, so they had to kneel to welcome and send them off.</p>

<h3>Revival of Street Vendors</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>The street vendors in this city have disappeared after the city authorities' serious crackdown since September 1st; but the problem is that they have only "disappeared," not been completely resolved. (Here, "resolved" means resolving this matter, not solving the livelihood of the street vendors.)</p>
<p>Disappearing is only temporary, so they will "become more cunning over time"; in recent days, the vendors who once disappeared have gradually revived. Some are disintegrated into parts, abandoning their stalls and carrying many items for sale by hand (such as glass purses, etc.), selling and shouting on the streets; some are integrated into a whole, gathering in certain alleys to form a small commercial market.</p>
<p>We are well aware of the benefits of cracking down on street vendors: such as the city's new look, the gradual order of pedestrian traffic, the coming disappearance of the theft wind in the docks, and the greater benefits: making it easier for national products to find a way out, etc. But more important is also the widely known: the issue of street vendors changing careers. Just as when swatting flies, one must also pay attention to how to dispose of garbage.</p>
<p>We do not oppose cracking down on street vendors because of the difficulty of street vendors changing careers; but we believe that since the authorities have acted swiftly first, they must strive to implement it thoroughly afterwards; judging from the current situation of street vendors gradually reviving, the government has only done the first step. If it is allowed to continue, within half a month, the city's street vendors will still return to their old look, there is no doubt. So, why bother in the first place?</p>
<p>We hope that if we do nothing, then fine, but if we do, don't be a flash in the pan! It is certainly not easy for street vendors to change careers, but it is only not easy, not impossible! In any case, the government cannot allow the crackdown on street vendors on September 1st to become almost pointless!</p>

<h3>Students Who Cheat Discuss Cheating</h3>
<p>— Gu Yu</p>
<p>I am a student, and after reading Mr. Ling Ren’s "Discussing Cheating on Exams" on September 10th, I feel sad and ashamed because I am also a part of the cheating, and almost all of my classmates cheat. However, I am not entirely satisfied with what Mr. Ling Ren wrote.</p>
<p>The reasons for cheating that Mr. Ling Ren thinks students have are only half true, and I cannot agree with them because many are real-world problems.</p>
<p>Mr. Ling Ren said: "Please, educators, pay attention to this! Don't assume that students with good grades are necessarily more competent." In fact, haven't schools and educational experts already noticed this? Proposing a demerit for one instance of cheating, and expulsion for three instances, is useless. This is too passive because the tighter the control, the more sophisticated the students' cheating techniques become!</p>
<p>Moreover, cheating is now too widespread. I dare say that nine out of ten students cheat. Does this mean that all students are bad? Therefore, educational experts should pay attention to the current education system as a proactive solution. In schools nowadays, there are often seventy or eighty students in a class. Teachers are just going through the motions, and principals are making money. As a result, students also fool around and don't study. When exams come, some teachers deliberately make things difficult for students, making them fail, while others are afraid that their students' poor performance will bring them down, so they let them cheat. Thus, a culture of cheating is fostered. Therefore, the proactive approach should be to pay attention to teachers' qualifications, ensure students understand the material, and base grades on regular performance, reducing the pressure of exams. Then, students will naturally cheat less.</p>
<p>Furthermore, current scholarships are based on grades as the approval standard. Impoverished students are not necessarily good at their studies. I hope the education authorities and school authorities pay attention to this. Scholarship approvals should not be based on grades. Then, the culture of cheating can naturally be reduced again.</p>
<p>In addition to these two points, students should have the concept that scholarship comes first, and grades are irrelevant. This way, if there are only a few students who cheat, they can be eliminated as a detriment to the group. Students who cheat because other students cheat will naturally no longer do so.</p>
<p>[Editor's Note: Although there are reasons for the current trend of cheating, this is not something to be encouraged. Mr. Gu Yu's article can be used as a reference for the authorities, but not as a justification for students who cheat! We oppose cheating in any situation, just as public officials cannot use "too little income" as a reason for corruption! Otherwise, everything bad will become excusable!]</p>
<h3>Learning from Merchants</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhi, translated from the September issue of Reader's Digest</p>
<p>King George V of England was known for his thrift and wanted to instill the same virtue in his descendants. However, Prince Wilson, on the contrary, preferred to spend money. Once, when he was studying at school, he wrote to his father requesting extra expenses. Unexpectedly, in the reply, he was severely reprimanded and instructed to change his ways and learn more from merchants. As a result, the King saw in the next letter: "...I have decided to take your advice and have sold your letter to a collector, earning twenty-five pounds..."</p>
<h3>Divorce Because of Kisses</h3>
<p>— Xu Ying, translated from Continental News</p>
<p>Ms. Dix is an expert on difficult issues between men and women and has long been considered an authority. Below is her recent work elucidating "the art of kissing."</p>
<p>Recently, a divorce case occurred where the husband claimed that his wife always asked him for five U.S. dollars every time she kissed him. This was pure extortion, and therefore, such a wife was unacceptable. The wife, however, admitted it directly but said that it didn't necessarily have to be five dollars; she could be flexible with whatever amount her husband had.</p>
<p>As to whether the husband thought that kissing between husband and wife was a divinely granted right, and therefore unwilling to pay unnecessary black market prices because of his wife's demands, or whether the wife disliked her husband's woodpecker-like kisses and considered them superfluous, so she came up with this method to slightly restrict them, we have not yet learned the details. The magistrate hearing the case may be racking his brains over this question and feel strange that such a thing could have such a serious impact on married life.</p>
<p>We will temporarily not discuss whether a kiss with one's wife is worth five dollars. What we should pay attention to now is a cause of pain in marital relationships. For this, many wives have shed countless tears. This is why men's attitudes towards kissing their wives are so different before and after marriage.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is no wonder that wives always suspect why their husbands always treat kissing as an obligation and why their kisses are always cold.</p>
<p>The reason why kisses between husband and wife are cold is probably because they happen every day, so they feel ordinary and unremarkable. Common habits dictate that couples should kiss dozens of times a day. We seem to treat kissing as a habit, but we neglect another truth: a kiss during the tenderest moment, when love reaches its climax, is more valuable than millions of woodpecker-like kisses!</p>
<p>Things are valued when they are rare. So, the wife who asked her husband for five dollars for a kiss is smarter than those women who ask their husbands as they leave home, "Hey! Are you leaving like that? You forgot to do something."</p>
<h3>Cherish School Reputation, Protect Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>— Jian Zhi</p>
<p>During lunch on the 11th, the chairman of the Student Union reported an interesting piece of news: "In order to uphold strict exams and promote academic integrity, we are petitioning the principal. Please sign if you agree."</p>
<p>Immediately, people put down their rice bowls and rushed to sign their names, forming a swarm. Two large sheets of white paper were quickly filled with signatures.</p>
<p>It is because of strict exams that Fudan has its current status, climbing to the level of a second-tier national university.</p>
<p>"Just roll up your bedding and you can get in." This was the common perception of private Fudan in the past.</p>
<p>How can the school reputation, which was painstakingly earned over eight years, be allowed to go to waste in one day? Every member of Fudan has such concerns, leading to today's petition to the principal.</p>
<p>Whether past glory and future brilliance can be maintained and promoted is a rare test.</p>
<p>What is even more hoped for is that the efforts of Fudan students will influence the entire academic atmosphere of Shanghai, correct the general malpractices of examinations, and bring a new perspective to the Shanghai education community. Then, today's action will have an immortal significance!</p>

<h3>Office Assistant in the Post Office</h3>
<p>— Xin Cheng</p>
<p>Office assistant – listening to instructions and being dispatched by others; if we speculate on this profession solely based on the meaning of the words "office assistant," then the work of an office assistant is very lowly. Currently, in the Shanghai Post Office, besides the mail carriers, there are also a group of office assistants. Their number is only one-fifth of the number of mail carriers. Although they are both considered "service workers" in name, their income is far less than that of mail carriers. Before August 13th, because of the generous treatment of the post office and the frequent opportunities for promotion, there were always many applicants for each post office exam, whether for postal clerks, postal assistants, mail carriers, or office assistants. The applicants were satisfied just to be able to step through the door. They thought that after working as an office assistant for one or two years, they could become a postal assistant, then a postal clerk, then a postal director. This was the hope of office assistants and the hope of everyone working in the postal service.</p>
<p>Do not despise an office assistant in the Shanghai Post Office. It is not unheard of in the history of the post office for someone to become a director starting as an office assistant! One of the leaders in the Shanghai labor community today, who holds a very important position, also started as an office assistant! Regarding the daily work of office assistants, because the post office organization is large and complex, their work mostly involves delivering official documents and letters between various departments within the bureau. In recent years, due to the post office suspending exams, partly because the Shanghai postal authorities are aware of the level of Shanghai office assistants, selling stamps, selling stamp duty, sorting mail... (the work of postal clerks and assistants) is also slowly being shared by office assistants. Indeed, many office assistants are competent enough to be compared with clerks and assistants. Especially the few who were recruited in 1939, most of them are still in their twenties. Among them, there is Lao Gu, who studied industrial technology and is called an "engineer," and Xiao Luo, who is about to graduate from Shanghai University and is called an "accountant." It may be a loss to society for a university or technical college graduate to work as an office assistant, but temporarily unable to find a better-paying position, they can only look forward to a bright future. This group of young office assistants does not become passive because of the difficult and low-status work they do every day. They have organized a "Sincerity Association" to connect with each other, enhance their knowledge and skills, and promote a spirit of mutual assistance. "Where there is sincerity, metal and stone will be opened." This is their ambition today. Perhaps in ten or twenty years, there will be several directors or several labor leaders emerging from this group of office assistants!</p>
<p>Finally, I have a statement: my motivation for writing this article is definitely not to specifically praise them, but to hope that society should not underestimate these unsung heroes too much, and society should reward those with promising futures and diligent workers and should pay special attention to them!</p>
<h3>Serial Comics: The Adventures of Sanmao the Soldier (101)</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Leping</p>
<p>News Figure</p>
<h3>John Leighton Stuart, Friend of China, Religious Leader, Educator</h3>
<p>— Qian Fanfu</p>
<p>The family environment during childhood influenced and determined the life of John Leighton Stuart: His family was a mixed organization of a school, hospital, religion, and society. He was nurtured and cultivated from an early age, shaping his character as an educator and the piety of a missionary.</p>
<p>(Family of Educators) Tracing the family history of Dr. Stuart: His great-grandfather, Stuart Robert, was the president of a university in Kentucky, USA. His grandfather, Stuart Todd, founded "Stuart University" in the same place, which was the first women's university in the state. His father, Stuart John, was one of the earliest missionaries to China. Seeing the backward state of education in China at the time, he established a primary school in Hangzhou. However, to adhere to the church's regulations and focus on preaching doctrine, the school was closed not long after it opened.</p>
<p>It was at this time—1876 AD—that Stuart was born in Hangzhou. His mother's name was Mary Horton. Like the wives of other missionaries, she possessed extraordinary talent and perseverance. When she moved to Beijing with her husband and children, she served as a housewife, seamstress, doctor, nurse, and teacher. Her kindness, gentleness, and fervor deeply imprinted her personality on everyone's heart. Leighton's moral character was influenced by excellent influences early in life.</p>
<p>(Grew up in China) Leighton was the eldest son, and he and his siblings learned to speak like Chinese children. He lived with his parents among the Chinese people. It was not until he was eleven years old that he was sent back to the United States. He felt strange and different in his home country, but he overcame all difficulties with courage and patience.</p>
<p>After five years back home, he became accustomed to the new environment. In 1892, he entered Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia. Among the courses, he was most interested in Greek and Latin, and from that time on, he began to admire the life of teaching. After graduation, he returned to his alma mater, "Pantops Academy," and taught for three years.</p>
<p>In 1899, he entered Union Theological Seminary to study. After graduating, he and two classmates traveled as clergymen in the southern United States and raised funds for the church, achieving unexpected success. One of the two classmates was later David McConnell, who came to China with Dr. Stuart. These two like-minded young men met the Lott sisters and, within a year, the two couples held their weddings on the same day.</p>
<p>(Honeymoon in West Lake) The date of the Stuart couple's wedding was November 1904. One month after their wedding, they went to Hangzhou together. Two years later, their only son, Stuart Lee, was born in China (he later became a pastor).</p>
<p>After Dr. Stuart returned to Hangzhou, he joined his father's work as a preacher for three years, followed by his appointment as a professor of theology in Nanjing. He taught at the Nanjing school for a total of eleven years. The quiet school life made him happy. During this period, he published Chinese works such as "Required Reading of the New Testament in the Original Language," "New Commentary on the Revelation of the New Testament," and "The Substitute for War."</p>
<p>In 1918, Stuart was hired as the president of Yenching University in Beijing. In the early stages of "Yenching University," there were only a hundred students, and financial difficulties forced him to raise funds from the outside world. "Yenching University" turned from danger to safety several times, all thanks to his efforts. Therefore, he would jokingly say to people, "Whenever I see a beggar, I always feel that I am in the same business as them."</p>
<p>In total, Dr. John Leighton Stuart preached and taught in China for thirty years. His contribution to the education community in our country can be said to be the first foreign meritorious person. This July, at the age of seventy, he took office as the U.S. Ambassador to China, working hard without fear of hardship. The friendship he has given to China will not be forgotten by the Chinese people!</p>
