<p>〔中央社北平十三日電〕葉劍英十三日下午在北京飯店對記者發表簡單談話如次：本人從未來故都，適才於平市上空俯視一週，深感其名不虛傳，堪稱我國最偉大之都市。此次我等三委員北來，負責執行部工作，決本合作精神，採取一致行動。政治協商會議在重慶開幕後，會塲空氣至爲和諧，和平前途極爲樂觀，今日和平建國，乃爲全國一致之要求，吾人當立即停止衝突，恢復交通，從事建設。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十三日電〕葉劍英稱：由於停戰協定之結果，渠不信今後國軍代表訪問共產區各城將有任何困難。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十三日電〕軍事調處執行部人員，已大部到此，解決中國內爭之最重大工作，今日已開端倪。共同參加此和平努力之美人一百二十五名，國民黨人員一百七十名，共黨人員一百七十名之住宿問題，已布置停當。各級官員在美大使館參贊武官白魯特上校生持下，今晨已在協和醫院之大廈內開始工作。</p>
<h3>協商會今日開四次會　討論聯合政府案　五人小組昨商定議程範圍</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶十三日電〕政治協商會議今日因星期例假休會，惟五人小組會仍舉行協商。決定大會讓程計分政治·軍事·國民大會，憲法草案四議題，依次討論。十四日下午三時舉行第四次大會，即開始討論第一議題政治問題中之聯合政府案。預料將有激烈之辯論。明日以後之議程尙未擬定。仍將由五人小祖會決定詳細節目。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十三日電〕政治協商會議由陳立夫·董必武·陳啓天·梁漱溟·王雲五等會員組成之五人小組，十三日上午九時協商議程，經商定如下：</p>
<p>（一）根據本會議辦法第三條之規定範圍，議題分政治·軍事·國民大會·憲法草案四類，政治類再分甲·乙兩糾，甲爲政府組織，乙爲施政綱領，共爲五題。</p>
<p>（二）自十四日起，每日列一類，在大會作大體討論，俟廣泛交換意見後，即由主席指定分組委員會草擬報吿，即協商提出大會。</p>
<p>（三）政治一類因包含二題，如大會一次討論未畢，可再討論一次，並將其餘各類順延。</p>
<p>（四）分組委員每組由各方推荐會員一人至二人，由主席指定之，每人可兼兩組。</p>
<p>（五）分組委會開會時，新聞記者不參加。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十二日電〕三次會議主要議程，爲聽取政府與共黨代表報吿，雙方會談經過，周恩來在報吿中，重新愼重申述共黨承認三民主義爲中國所必需，承認蔣主席在全國的最高領導地位，承認國民戴爲第一大黨，尊重其閙爭之歷史與地位，承認國民政府、在解釋這四點承認時，雖沒有檢討八年某些違抗軍令，政令的事實，沒有檢討朱德延安總部的受降命令。對於去年在延安籌備的解放區聯合會議，則予種種新的解釋，認爲那只是民衆團體的聯合會，並未企圖另樹全國性之政權。談到要求政府承認共黨所建樹之解放區政權及武裝時，並聲明承認後仍然可以改組。周恩來這一坦白而有誠意的報吿，贏得熱烈的掌聲。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十二日電〕政府與共黨旣經會談，爲甚麼讓軍事衝突繼續而且擴大，再月來衝突原因何在，當時會談爲何未予解決，此爲全國人民疑問，邵力子於十二日報吿給予具體答覆，在八月廿九開始商談時，並朱忽略此點共黨提出停止一切武裝衝突，各就原地待命，政府爲了受降，不得不有軍事調動，曾經多次商談讓步，最後向共黨提出，只要共黨軍隊不擱阻國軍受降，自無問題，可是這種保障和平的最後建議，並沒有得到共黨的諒解和同意，這過去在會談紀要中沒有發表的一項內幕，負担了兩個月軍事衝突責任。</p>
<h3>東北同為國土　決無自治理由</h3>
<p>〔合眾社北平十三日電〕此間東北居民協會，致電政治協商會議與馬歇爾特使，反對陪都某數界人士所提東北應視爲特別區之主張。力陳東九省爲中國不可分之一部，決無予以自治地位之理由。繼謂：在過去十四年中，所有自由東北人追隨蔣委員長之領導，矢志不變，東北決不能與中國本部相分離。</p>
<h3>部令進行修復工作　周景炎談華北交通　停止衝突命令如果貫澈實施後　各鐵路可望於三月后恢復通車</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶十三日電）自政府與共產黨同時下令停止軍事衝突後，關於恢復全國交通之準備情形，據交通部負責人表示，在政治協商會議之第二日，交部已通令所屬，進行各項交通恢復工作，惟此項工作係屬全面性質，須與共產黨協商之處多，故除通令各級機構一致動員，進行修復工作外，交部當另有詳細辦法。至於長江軍運問題，因收復區接收之未完成者，仍需部隊前往，故此項決定有待軍事調處執行商討。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十二日電〕此間交通當局已加緊　備恢復交通，交部平津區特派員石志仁，奉命　定修復鐵路計劃，自張家口撤退之電信人員，現已由交部在此登記甄審，池備令其重返原地工作。</p>
<p>〔木報北平十二日電〕如停止衝突恢復交通命令得以貫澈實施後，則全部華北鐵路可望於三個月後恢復通車。記者今日會往訪華北交通修復工程督導組長周景炎，據談各路情形如次：（一）平漢路由北平南下可通元氏，但保定至元氏間時遭共軍襲擊破壞，不能經常通車。元氏至彰德間情况不明，傳該段路基已被澈底破壞，若十站房亦被焚燬。去歲十一月八日，該組已將材料備齊，擬即開工修復，後因豫北軍事變化中止，此段如將材料人力準備齋全，在無妨碍條件下，約一月可修復。（二）津浦綫由犬津南下通至東光，由東光南下至連鎭間，枕木被拆去破壞共三處，計一一三〇公尺，連鎮至京官屯間破壞最烈，不僅路基被挖成溝，且被放進水，京官屯至禹城間情况不明，禹城南下可通袞州，袞州利國驛間與臨棗支綫皆情况不明，此路破壞情形未獲詳細報告，亦無法估計修復時間。（三）平綏路由北平西上可至靑龍橋，由康莊迄天鎭間，爲共產軍佔領，共產軍之行車自懷來始，而以天鎭爲終點。由天鎭經大同迄緩包間，被共產軍破壞，此段已進行修復，若全路通車，由太原北上可通寗武，寗武北至懷仁問，被共產軍破壞，由太原南下可至侯馬，侯馬以南情况不明。（五）膠濟路濟南向東可通淄川，其中大臨池至周村一段，係本月六日新修好者，東　被破壞之三處藍村膠縣間，高密坊子問，楊家莊淄川店問，俱因缺乏材料，尙未修復，如準備充份，約半月即可修復。（六）北寗路由北平可通錦縣，不久軍車或可通打虎山，此路鐵軌亦時遭破壞，綜觀華北各鐵路之修復與準備工作，須三月始可完成。停止衝突命令發布前，共軍對北平鐵路最後一次較大規模襲擊，爲七日上午二時至四時之襲長辛店，共軍參加者約二千人，鐵道警備部隊頗有死傷。共產軍對華北鐵道之破壞，妨害通訊，妨害列軍襲擊車站等項，十月份爲二五九次，十一份爲破壞之最高峯，計六〇六次，十二月份已漸减低，約三百餘次。</p>
<h3>三路交通安全　尚待事實保證</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕徐州加急電話，停戰命令到達徐州，鄭州後，顧主任祝同，劉主任峙當以最迅速之方法，分飭各部一體恪遵，停戰命令頒發後眞正之效果如何，可於三日後之交通狀况見之。現津浦徐濟段之交通安全尙在試騐中，　海東段之開徐段以及平漢北段南起鄭州北迄彰德間一百零三公里之交通安全，亦須待事實保證。上述各路沿綫之駐軍與護路隊，接奉停戰命令後，今後之任務將改爲護路，據某路領語本報記者云，此後護路部隊之困難，如謂已無，尙嫌過早，但如共軍守信不再破壞鐵路，護路隊即明辨匪共，較易處理矣</p>
<h3>陳誠抵首都　白崇禧返京迎晤</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕副參謀總長白祟禧，昨日午後四時返京，今日曾親赴江岸迎晤由渝來京之軍政部長陳誠。陸軍總部停戰命令發出後一日，已接獲各地覆電多起，內容皆表示敬謹遵令。據揚州訊：蘇北泰縣附近，現仍有另星行動，但國軍旨在確保揚泰，即使共軍爲擁護退却而慮張聲勢，亦不予追擊。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京士三日急電〕軍政部長陳誠，乘同心艦自渝東下，十三日晚七時抵京，副參謀總長白崇禧及着毅肅等均登艦歡迎。陳部長胃腸病復發，近巴稍痊，據悉，陳氏此次途經宜昌時，目擊該地還鄕人民　集，因交通工具缺乏，疏運困難，食住均成問題，異常關切，曾具體指示該地負責方面儘速疏運，並認爲目前渝宜段航輪應暫以沙市爲止，以减少宜昌之擁擠。</p>
<h3>京滬鐵路沿綫　增強警備力量</h3>

<h3>軍委會發言人宣稱　魯豫共軍仍進攻　對共黨報紙宣傳表示遺憾</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十三日電〕軍事委員會發言人十三日發表談話稱：本日重慶新華日報，以首條地位刋載「熱河冀東國民黨軍隊，破壞停止內戰命令」之消息，顯係含有宣傳作用，查自政府代表與中共代表商定停止衝突恢復交通辦法後，本會即於十日晚電令各部隊，自電到之時起，即日開始實施，至十三日下午十二時止，務必在各地完全實施，此項命令之傳遞，因單位過多，綫路擁擠，通訊困難，當難立即全部到達。周恩來氏十日在記者招待會中，答復記者問時，亦曾謂「在三天之內，一律停戰，也許有些村落，因命令還未送到，致尙有零星戰鬥」，乃該報竟不顯下達命令時問，與通信困難，甚至將十日國軍進入凌源之事，亦行提出，大肆宣傳，殊出意外，且中共部隊，現仍在大規模進犯　南，豫北等地，本會先后據顧主任祝詞，陳總司令大慶，胡司令長官宗南等報吿，計有（一）共產軍新四軍陳毅部第七師及魯南軍區部隊共兩萬餘，於一月十一日攻佔魯南棗莊煤礦南大井，幷大肆破壞。（二）共產軍新四軍部隊，網續猛攻臨城，幷破壞鐵道。（三）共產軍一一五師及第八師兩萬餘人，十二猛攻賈汪（徐州東北）煤礦。（四）共產軍太行軍區之老二團，老七團，老八團，新八團，四十一團，四十五團，九十八團及　河支隊共萬餘人，由第七分區司令張宏一指揮，於十二日圍攻豫北修武縣城及該城以南之大紙坊，至下午攻擊益猛。（五）共產軍太行軍區李達部之三八五旅，三八六旅，新一旅及冀魯豫軍區宋人窮部之第一團，四團，五團，六團，八國，十團，十四團，十五團等二萬餘人，分由第五分區司令韋金，第九分區司令曾承金指揮，十二日起圍攻安陽，顯有攻佔豫北企圖。政府對於中共部隊以上大舉進攻之情况，始終緘默，幷未予以公佈者，不外以尙未超過規定時限，藉示容忍及政府停止衝突之決心，惟共黨報紙新華日報竟一面抹煞其攻擊政府軍隊之事實，一面不顯電令到達之困難，於共同同意停止衝突，最後限期（十三日下午十二時）尙未滿限之時，即謂政府軍隊破壞停戰命令，似將宣傳置於國家利益之上殊屬遣憾。</p>

<h3>政府與共黨代表　會談之四階段　邵力子周恩來兩會員向第三次協商會報告</h3>
<p>第一報告　邵力子</p>
<p>主席各位先生：會談紀要的全文，早經公布。我的報吿，祇問要的就社會各方面對於會談中的疑問，說明幾點：第一，常常有人問起，會談的雙方，究竟有沒有誠意？我的答覆是：有誠意的。第二，常常有人問起會談沒有公開，除了波表的以外，究竟還有什麼秘密沒有？有沒有重要的問題沒有發表出來？我的答覆是：沒有。即有一兩點未包含在會談紀要中，也並無不可公開之處，仍可以讓社會人士知道的。第三，有人看到會談時期那麼長，又沒有眞正能把問題解決下來，便要問是否雙方代表有不盡責任之處，甚或有意把時間拖得很長？我的答覆是：沒有敢偸懶，更沒有敢故意拖延，第四，更或有人要問：會談紀要發表以後，問題不能就解決，是否雙方有意不肯讓步，以致僵持下來？這一點，我的答覆是：在若干點上，確有不肯讓步的情形，政府如此，共黨也如此，這因爲：（一）是多年以來的本實造成的困難，（二）是兩方面的立塲本不相同，各有不能讓步之處，他讓步的地方也確實不少，社會各方面要問的，不外三四點。</p>
<p>以下，我就在這個範圍以內綜合說明：周恩來先生已說明，從抗戰以來，共黨一向承認實行三民主義，承認國民黨是領導的大黨，承認蔣王席的領導地位，到今天還是如此，這是我們很欽佩的。至於政府方面，更是從抗戰那一天起，就決定要團結全國的力量，同時承認共黨增加抗戰的地位，雖然後來逐漸發生不幸的情事，</p>
<p>蔣主席仍是一貫的決定用政治方法解決共黨問題，曾屢次向全國國民，宣吿這一個決定，一到抗戰結束，更幾次打電報請毛澤東先生到重慶來·毛先生一向不出來，這次也到重慶來，這些當然都是最有誠意的表現。毛先生來到重慶以後，蔣主席和毛先生有幾次談話，談得很坦白，要說的話全都說了，我們的會談就本着這種精神，來進行的。從毛先生來重慶到雙十節發表會談紀要止，我們的會談，的可分做四個階段：</p>
<p>第一階段</p>
<p>最初四天的連續談話，是第一階段，當時共然方面，有一個意見，先培養談話的良好悄緒，政府方面是同意的，因爲過去不幸的事悄太多，不先有良好的情緒，就談各種具體問題，解次一定很困難。政府的初意，本希望解次愈快愈好，雪艇先生昨天說過，他曾主張在十天之內，解次問題，不過另一個看法，是怕欲速不達，所以光培養情緒，再談實際問題，也是很好的辦法。在那四天之內，我們充分交換了意見。</p>
<p>第二階段</p>
<p>九月四日起，談實際問題，開始就發現有很難解次的情形也，即是會談紀要中第九，第十，兩項問題，第十項地方政權問題，是終於未得解決的。第九項軍事問題，在會談紀要中，已有決定辦法，但經過的困難很多，且也尙待眞正解決。從九月四日起，大家見到問題不容易解決，認為培養良好悄緒，還很重要，不能念急求解決。從四日至捻一日，共有八次會議，這可說是第二段。有時每大都談，有時隔一兩天談。九月十，十一，十二，這三日，就每天都談。</p>
<p>第三階段</p>
<p>本來廿一日可以發表公報，因爲對地方政權問題，共黨堅持主張，沒有得到協議，結果未能發表公報。當時的情形幾乎使會談擱淺，但是我們不願意眞的擱淺，因爲這是關係國民安危，甚至世界和平的問題，所以念七日又開始商談，到十月五日爲止，共有四次會談。這可說是第三階段。</p>
<p>第四階段</p>
<p>在這四次商談中，兩方面又充分交換意見，但還有得不到同意的，而毛先生因躭擱的日子已相當長久，有即回延安的必要。蔣主席早曾說過，毛先生隨時可以回延安。照當時的情形，公報幾乎仍舊不能發佈。我剛才說過，發表會談紀要，很要感謝張文白先生的最後努力，在會談紀要公吿前幾天，可以說是第四階段（待續）</p>
<p>第二報告　周恩來</p>
<p>政治協商會議第三次會議中，周會員恩來報吿政府與中共代表會談經過如下：</p>
<p>主席各位先生：國共會談的歷史甚長，中間經過九年之久。九年之中，本人除去極短的一個時期以外，幾全部參加。今天抗戰已經勝利，和平階段已經開始，我不想把過去抗戰八年中國共會談悄形在此報吿，祇想就八年國共會談中間一此方針上的問題說一說。在抗戰開始以前，民國二十五年到二十六年間，中共代表與當時的政府代表曾有會談，所談的中心問題也同今天同樣的，是和平，是民主，所不同的，當時是要停止內戰，團結抗戰，而八年以後的今天，所要求的，是停止內嚴團結建國。抗戰以前，彼此希望停止內戰團結抗戰的目的，達到了發動了七七抗戰，因此，我在這個地方報吿的時候，有着同樣的信念，現在一定能達到停止內戰團結建國的目的。</p>
<p>九年來，我參預商談兩次提出同樣的要求，都實現了停止內戰，雖然一方面是感慨萬端，另一方面覺得兩度達到目的，首先爲中國人民着想，就是個人也覺得獲得一點安慰，不過不管怎樣，我們國家民族兩度經過這樣的波折，總是萬分不幸，據此，我感覺關於抗戰中商談經過的報吿，只須舉出一點來說明，最初商談時的原則，旣然是停止內戰，團結抗職，所以在抗戰持久以後的商談，便多限於局部問題的解決，如陝甘寗邊區問題，敵後抗日軍隊的承認與編制問題，同時提出人民自由權利的要求，其時政府方面，也提出一些答復，因爲彼此意見距離尙遠，所以沒有得到解決，而最後一個時期，就是民國三十三年，中共方面再提出解決全局問題，即是在三屆五次國民參政會上，林參政員祖涵代表中共提出聯合政府的主張，參政會後，又經過幾度商量，在政府方面認爲這種主張，要動搖政府的法統，沒有接受。由於這些問題的存在，使得糾紛繼續，也就伏下抗戰勝利以後發生不幸的內戰的根源。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以後，新的時機來臨，蔣先生三次電邀毛先生·毛先生應邀，即時就開始抗戰以後新的商談，這一個時期商談的原則，是從一般的話到具體的問題。毛先生來渝後，政府方面指定王雪艇·張岳軍·張文伯·邵力子·四位先生爲代表，中共方面指定本人與王若飛同志爲代表，開始商談。（待續）</p>
<h3>周恩來向協商會報告　經驗得來的敎訓（續完）</h3>
<p>第二部份，是停戰如何進行，張岳軍先生說得很具體，職權方面，組織方面，範圍方面，都已講了。我要補充的是幾個有關問題。停戰協定第四項設軍事　處執行部，規定有四項任務：</p>
<p>第一在全國範圍內停止一切衝突，全面的停止衝突，就是南到海南島，北到內蒙，東到東北，西到綏遠，凡是有衝突的地方，都應該停止下來，這個命令下達，不僅需電報來往，還要派人員去通知，如海南島被封鎖了七八年了，中共領導的游擊部隊與政府部隊，發生軍事衝突，廣東其他各地，中共領導的部隊和政府部隊亦發生軍事衝突，還有別處中共領導的正規部隊撤走了，政府軍隊與中共領導的游擊部隊發生衝突，還有政府軍隊開入中共活動的區域，也有衝突，這事都應該停止下來，這些地方都應該由軍事調處執行部派人去監察，執行部要設許多站，許多組，到各地方去，但無論站或組，都是三方面派人一致行動，一致協議去求解決。十三號前全部衝突停止下來的計劃，可以迅連實現，北平軍事調處執行部三方面代表定本月十三號赴平，這個月內希望能派出站或組到達一切衝突地點，使一切衝突停止下來。</p>
<p>交通郵電　首須恢復</p>
<p>第二，恢復一切交通，首先要恢復鐵路交通，這是由於軍事衝突停頓的，還有在抗戰中被封鎖的，不僅是走路就是郵電被阻留的也很多，所以三人會議要恢復一切永陸空交通，郵電交通的障礙也要撤去，這才是眞正恢復交通。眞正交通自由，在停戰命令第三項裏，可以看得出來。</p>
<p>第三，執行部，要執行的第三項任務是受降間題，現在還有近廿萬的敵人沒有究全解除武裝地區主要是在華北，中國東部也有一些，在政府部隊地區，在中共領導的部隊所包圍的地區，敵人武裝都要解除，這也是執行部要過問的事。第四，如何使解除武裝的敵人俘虜送回本國，走那些交通綫，也是執行部要過問的。這四項都與停戰有關，也與盟國有關，所以軍事調處執行部都要過問，如此做去，不僅一切軍事衝突停止了，交通恢復了，就是引起內戰主因之一的受降問題，也就會不存在了。</p>
<p>關於執行部工作範團以外而是也有關聯的事，如剛才張岳軍先生所說的軍事移動的以外事項，也要報吿執行部，使執行部可以判明，可以免除藉口和誤會，這點也要補充說明，停戰命令是由政府授權張岳軍先生，中共授權本人簽字，同時對外宣佈，並由</p>
<p>蔣委員長和中共毛澤東主席雙方頒佈命令，昨晚張岳軍先生吿我說：蔣委員長已經下令通知各軍，本人今晨得到延安消息：昨天晚上也已下了命令，根據我們約定時問內，一切衝突停止。</p>
<p>整編軍隊　永弭內戰</p>
<p>第三部份，是關於如何消弭內戰，這是此次政治協商會議主要之解決的問題。我個人願說明一點意見，因爲剛才張岳軍先生提到希望在停戰以後，迅速開三人軍事小組會議，商談整編問題，軍隊應該整編，全中國的軍隊應該整編，中共軍隊也應該整編，以求達到軍隊國家化的目的。這是已經定了的事。至於如何消弭內戰，那不是包括在三人軍事小組討論範圍以內，我想這是政治協商會議要討論的問題之一·我們在這方面，有下列幾點希望：（一）要消弭內戰，要恢復交通，有一個原則，即國內各方意見的衝突，黨派意見的衝突，凡是屬於政治性質的，都應用政治方式來解決，決不可因此面演成軍事衝突。國內問題，應由政府解決。蔣主席曾經幾次聲明，現在世界的問題尙且要運用政治方式解決，何况露內的問題呢？國內一切問題，都要由政治方式來解決，就是政治協商會議召開的原因。不過，我們對於這個問題有一個觀念，旣然目前國內問題，祇能用政治方式解決，那麼不同思想與不同意見的份子，除掉是刑事犯，或述反一般法律可以依法辦理外，其他不論什麼政治原因，沒有方法國除或消除的。這一個原則，必須確立。</p>
<p>（二）關於重事考察團由國民參政會及政治協商會議推選公正人士組織，這點能够做到，一定有許多寳貴意見告訴雙方，吿訴全國，同時對於決定怎麼樣消弭內亂的方案，一定能得到很大的帮助。（三）我們覺得對於敵人在投降以後，仍然拿着武器殘殺中國人民的，應該視爲戰爭罪犯，予以處罰·（四）我們以爲對於解散偽軍，應該決定具體辦法，這是會談紀要中曾經雙方同意的原則，希望政府早定辦法·綢軍之參加內戰挑撥內職者，應了以嚴重的處罰。</p>
<p>共黨部隊　決定整編</p>
<p>（五）整軍計劃，關係我們的和平建國非常之大，將來可以併入和平建國方案內討論，所以政治協商會議對於整軍問題有商量必要。如能得到各政黨的同意，然後擬具數個計畫，在這個計整之下，中共所領導的部隊，定當依照計畫來整軍，同時中共曾答應整編爲廿個師，一定可以在三人小組會議中切實商談，這樣才能使全國軍隊走上國家化的道路。我可以代表中共代表團，也可以代表中國共產黨，保證這件事一定能够做到。上面這五點，有目前關於消弭內戰的意見，至於根本消弭內戰的辭法，是政治民主化的問題，範圍牽涉甚廣，要會議諸位先生從畏討論。（中央社重慶十一日電）</p>
<h3>從美國後門跨入　觀光紐約與華府　本報特約記者　朱家讓寄自紐約</h3>
<p>戰後還如戰時，從加拿大到紐的的火車，亦尙未恢復臥舖設備，大家又得眼巴巴的坐一夜，於是夜深以後，很多人有機可乘，便也紛紛躺下身來，擱起脚來，弄得橫七竪八，烏烟瘴氣，光景頗有點像京滬杭的三等夜車。查護照，查行李，都在車上幹，這樣等到站，可不再麻煩，方法倒不差。平時入美境手續一向較煩，但我這回從美國的後門抄了進去，以致健康證防疫證等都無須盤問，輕易極了。</p>
<p>天一亮，火車就在美國境內疾駛了。看廣闊平坦的原野，這是天賦獨厚富源蘊蓄的肥大美地。它在過去五年中，肩負了民主國兵工廠的大責任，而且躬流血汗，在世界每個角落揚威奮鬥，如今旋轉乾坤，把地球救活了，我是一個中國人，心靈上更禁不住流露了肅然的敬意。</p>
<p>早上八點鐘，車抵紐約中央車站，我開始嘗試美國的生活了。車站的規模比倫敦維多利亞還大，火車月　都在地下，這是一種新設計。車站牆上，都懸一面大美國旗，倒是公民訓練的一法。</p>
<p>高一百〇二層　世界第一摩天樓</p>
<p>這各聞世界的紐的城，位處美東赫德遜河口，好像我們的上海，也有一條黃浦江。但要論氣派，上海自然惟有甘拜下風，尤其這裏的崇樓大厦，算是獨步天下，那有像紐的這樣的挨戶櫛比·過去我們看看畫片有時還以爲是玩具堆砌，如今身歷其地，才知並非夢境而十足是現實，那麼上海的國際飯店以及十三層樓，就差遠了。因爲這裹的所稱高樓，普通都要四十層以上，煤油大王洛克斐勒大廈，其中一座ＲＣＡ的高樓，凡七十層，八百五十三呎，算是很高了，每天吸引不少遊客上屋頂遊覽，開快車耳朵作痛，但排起名次，還在第四，最高者要推恩派亞大樓（Ｅmpixe），計一百〇二層，一千二百五十呎，其次應爲克雷斯勒（Ｃhrpsjer）大厦，七十一七層，一千〇四十六呎，再次為華爾大樓，層數雖不逮洛克斐勤，而高度則過之。紐約時報方塲的地盤，僅僅一條長三角形，而其高度本來也很出名，但至今相形，殊太見絀，每天屋頂週圍首要新聞的電光閃佈，已經照射不到多遠了。</p>
<p>電話六百萬次</p>
<p>係每日平均總數</p>
<p>紐約城實爲大西洋邊一個島，但現在大紐約共有五個行政區，旁及它的邊緣大陸·大紐約的面積，據統計長凡三十六哩，寬達十六哩半，人口總計七百六十七萬。以這樣一個世界大城的規模於是人文繁雜，車馬喧囂，亦便可想而知。有人對紐的作了幾個統計很有趣：說根據紐的聖經公會所印聖經，凡八十三種文字，供應本城居民，故紐的城的語言至少亦有這麼多種，所謂「五方雜處」，實已登峯造極。又據統計，紐約的自來水管長度四千五百英里，陰溝三千英里，地下車道五百英里，電話機約一百九十萬架，每日通括不下六百萬次，因爲平均每秒鐘即有一百七十五人在用電話。說到人的動態也是驚人：還是一九四二年的估計，每日由火車或輪船來往這里的已連二萬九千萬人，以此旅館餐廳到處皆是，以旅館而計，共有五百多所，凡十二萬個客房。以上數字或恐猶僅一二年前事，但今日到處客滿，找旅館難於上靑天，這問題依然嚴重萬分。</p>
<p>鄉下人走進城　不會變迷途羔羊</p>
<p>紐約城的精華區，就在這個長方形有島上。靠水都是碼頭，八萬噸的大船，隨便可以駛進赫德遜河停靠。紐約的繁榮實由海港造成，所以　總理要把上海遷到吳淞口，實有其地理上的必要。因爲地形是個長島，紐約的街道佈置，也就比任何都市來得有系統。也許美國人重數字，他們的市街除少數外，亦一律編成了號次，長的呌Ａvenue，橫的呌Street，號次分明，一望而知其部位所在，所以縱是鄕下人進城，亦不會變迷途的羔羊。然這城的市街固然方塊化，也有一條「斜路」直穿心臟，衝貫南北，那便是有名的花花世界百老匯路。</p>
<p>雪厚木葉盡禿</p>
<p>全城充滿光與熱</p>
<p>從歐洲到紐約一看，那簡直太幸福了。人家在缺水缺煤，少吃少穿，飢餓和吝嗇，却永遠不會從巴黎跟倫敦傳染過來。首先，覽虹燈光怪陸離，那一處不是電炬通明？火把每一間房子蒸得熱氣燻燻，雖時値寒冬，雪厚樹木　條，而依然暖燠，這城市準長有光有熱。這回大戰美國出了大力，但在這種城市裏，亦簡直看不出有什麼戰爭。高樓大厦，各國人都有在享福，馬路上人如過江之體，吃喝玩，美金在跳舞，你說那一樣辦不到？這城市每天消耗的物資，一定又是天文數字的。不說別的，說報紙吧，一天出版好幾次，紙張總是一大疊，像紐約時報多至三十五六頁，在中國及歐洲習慣了一張紙的，拿到手裘，藏不下袋，反嫌冗重，而報紙多，篇輻長，大家忙，誰能一一拜讀，於是略一翻閱，隨手又送進字節，可憐多少心血和工作的結晶，在人前耀一下眼就完了。美國的紙張眞不希奇，擦臉用紙，喝水用紙，浪費不知多少，然有時偶思，這種國家以這樣大的生產力，也必得大量浪費，才能使機器不休息，工人可以「充分就業」，不然，如果節約的話，資本主義便要恐慌了。</p>
<p>百聞不如一見　白宮像普通住宅</p>
<p>有一個機會，我也去了一國華盛頓。聖誕節邊雖然火車加班，不到一點鐘開一次，却是仍然人山人海，其中自然不少是新近回老家的兵士。車經費城，（Philadelphia），巴爾底摩（Baltimore），凡四小時而到。這裏的景象，顯然大不相同了，市街比紐約寬闊，兩邊樹木也多，高房子雖也不少，次不像紐約這樣的「雙峯挿雲」式，弄得「一線天」的討厭。電車蠕蠕的在靑上滾動，行人比較安靜多了，這是很理想的優美的住宅區。</p>
<p>但翠盛頓究竟是個政治首腦部，它的喧鬧不在商塲上，而在每座機關的建築裏。國務部和財政部是白宮左右兩旁的巨厦，鼎鼎有名的白宮，却不過像一個普通中上人家的住宅。房子倒眞是白的，然又矮又小，出乎意外：而且鄰近就是商業塲，電影院，門口旣無大招牌，也無武裝馬弁，草地上竪着一支旗桿，就算表示他們的元首所在。政府機關似以陸軍部規模很大，它的光榮的任務，現在已經勝利的完成了。</p>
<p>華府別具風采　簡潔明朗又精雅</p>
<p>華府的風景區，自林肯紀念堂直對華盛頓紀念塔是一個中心，但這些建築都是簡潔明朗，全無繁文褥節。林肯紀念堂一座房子內，僅僅一座林肯石像，此外別無他物，華盛頓塔根本是一支高聳雲表的石筍，最爲令人留連的，倒是國會和國會圖書館。</p>
<p>美國的國會，雖不如英國的古色盎然，而佈置粉雅，平時經常開放，任人參觀，乃其特色。建築大致長方形，正中圓頂大廳，把參衆兩院平分爲二，各有議塲樓室。</p>
<p>國會圖書館的藏書，自柏林毀樣後，恐怕要算世界第一·原來一座大房子不够，現在又開放了一座，內設很多特殊裝置的個人閱覽室，胡外聲響，一點不能入擾，圖書館的目錄櫃，已經浩如煙海，册籍之富，令人咋舌。</p>
<p>中國書籍卅種　贈為歇爾壯行色</p>
<p>圖書館編制，有個東方組中國部，綫裝書的搜藏，亦不下萬千册，係由中國職員帮同管理。這回馬歇爾元帥啣命來華，這東方組且曾選集有關中國參考書三十種送馬帥携行。這圖書館藏有美國獨立宜言原稿及憲法原稿展覽甚寳貴，一切管理，亦都新頴合理。</p>
<p>華盛頓在戰後的地位，仍然一天天地重要，國務卿東奔西走，杜魯門每週一次的招待記者會，不啻國際風雲的晴雨表。而且美國社會問題跟英國一樣，也在杌隍不安，通用汽車（Ｇ.E）普通電力（G.M）工潮，始終還在「拉鋸」狀態，全國電力工人且有明年一月總罷工的醞釀，眞傷了政府的腦筋。美國的輿論也寵雜，每一件事那免說好說壞，美軍派在我們華北，原爲解除日人武裝，而日來若十報紙，則大呌其快快撤回，尤其一張與倫敦同名的「每日工人」，簡直「友諠」的氣味太少。（一月五日電自紐約）</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>極重要而被疏忽的一羣　——清寒學生的營養問題——</h3>
<p>— 倪章祺</p>
<p>大戰之後，瘡痍滿目·今中央與盟邦救濟櫗關，各省與各市慈善團體，雖竭力援助，仍有粥少僧多，力不從心之歎。因此被疏忽而未及救濟者，恐不祗一羣·本文所指爲極重要的一羣·但旣云重要，而反被疏忽，則似乎矛盾。</p>
<p>誰是目前救濟工作極重要而被疏忽的一羣？我以爲乃勤儉好舉的學生。今先言其重要。</p>
<p>講到學生爲極重要份子，不難滔滔不絕，盈篇累贅，姑舉數例以明之：</p>
<p>孫總理幼年，亦爲學生羣中之一位。畢業後，初則醫治病人，繼則醫救衰弱危亂的病國，領導羣賢，創建民國。五十年前，若無孫總理之領導，或不幸而　總理逝世太早，則昔年同盟會國民黨的革命排滿，恐難迅速進行。</p>
<p>推而廣之，此次大戰中的四盟邦諸位領袖，與直接間接促成勝利的許多有功人員，假使他們在校時身體孱弱，在載時勢難担任艱鈑工作，則全世界所受影響爲何如？</p>
<p>安迪生氏在校年月不多，離校後孜孜研究，能以電燈留聲機等許多發明，貢獻於世界。假使他在校時因麥料不足而虛弱，或正向發明途徑進行而共人即死，則世界所受損失爲何如？</p>
<p>共他科學家如巴斯德，科霍，艾爾利希，達爾文譯氏，畢業後若因體弱而早死，則世界所受損失又何如？</p>
<p>右以史事爲喩，足見學生的責任如何重大，與他們的健康如何重要。</p>
<p>講到學生爲「被人所疏忽的一羣」，聞者或以爲不符事實；反之，有許多事實或可證明中央與各界的注重而且愛護學生。</p>
<p>抗戰期內，自由區與淪陷區曾竭力設法維持敎育，設立獎學金，助學金，免費額等，以助寒士。去年春，報上載某君獨捐助學金一萬萬，可知熱心愛助學生者，社會上大有人在。勝利來臨，敎育極被重視，僅以上海一地而言，有國立市立或私立的許多大學中學小學。私立學校雖經費拮据，亦繼續其助學金辦法。各界對於助學金也仍踴躍捐贈。敎育方面，學生似未被遺忘。</p>
<p>衛生方面，學生亦未被遺忘。衛生局的保健防疫處設有專管學校衛生的部分。衛生局又會同敎育局，組織健康敎育委員會。且市立各醫院並非偏聚於一區，而實分散於市的各方，學生患病者，可向附近市立醫院覓醫；而入學體格檢查，亦由相近的市立醫院擔任。</p>
<p>普通有許多學生，自稱無病，他人亦知共眞無病，若聽其心昔，查其肺部，檢共血，騐其尿，亦不顯出任何疾病證據。自然不在醫院救濟範圍之內。但使量其身體的畏與重，始知他們不及正常標準，尤以體重對於身長的比例（又稱榮養商數）之不及格，至可驚人。此許多學生，身重雖太輕，但旣非病人，醫師亦不認其爲病人；所以衛生局及市立醫院的研究組，與研究專家，互相合作，特着重此一問題。學生亦似未被疏忽。</p>
<p>雖然，知學生體重太輕之屬嚴重問題，知他們爲外强中乾的健康，亦知每日幫助他們數兩的營養食料，久之可收事半功倍之效；然迄今尙未實行救濟舉生營養食料，此眞憾事！吾所謂彼遺忘被疏忽者，即指學生的營養問題。</p>
<p>學生營養不良的問題，如被疏忽，則能累及其他不被疏忽的諸事，同歸虛擲。例如學生藉助學金在優良學校肄業，以各種衛生事業的進步，求學期內，未患傳染病；但其體重始終太輕，譬如築室於沙地，無堅固基礎，一遇在風驟雨，即難支持。他們自己的壯志，與各界對終他們的努力愛護與希望，均與彼積弱之體同成泡影！</p>
<p>報紙登載政府與許多慈善機關，致力於種種救濟工作，範圍頗廣，有安老所，育嬰所、育幼所、殘廢敎養所、習藝所，庇寒所、施粥所、婦女敎養所、助產所，門診施醫所、免費病床及其他。惜未聞提及學生營餐食料的補助！此眞美中不足的偶忘耶？抑將着手於此重要的補助工作耶？</p>
<p>就人道主義與同情心言之，則許多救濟工作均爲重要。今言補助學生營養食料的重要者，並非請置此於其他救濟工作之先，乃請兼籌並顧，不復長久遺忘與疏忽此同樣重要問題。筆者已屢提及，假若學生體弱而夭折，則他們的父母師友政府社會種種教養工作，咸等於虛擲，又若夭折者有安迪生氏的發明能力，則世界亦將蒙受損失。故補助營養食料的重要，次不在補助學金之下。助學金已成績斐然，而助養料尙未實行。後者在實行時稍稍繁墳，若社會熱心人士與專家之外，又有各校敎師幫同分配，必能實事求是，秩序井然。其詳細辦法，可由專家擬訂。</p>
<p>學生們的每日三餐飲食，與衣住行，均各有其家長担任，僅補給富於蛋白質與脂肪的食物每日數兩，久之可見確效。以每人每月所需之費計算，則所需少而收效宏，遠勝於其他救濟工作。</p>
<p>許多貧家往往節衣縮食，以敎育其子女，所謂家雖貧而學不輟者是也。抗戰初期，物價低廉，每元可買鷄蛋數十枚或牛乳數瓶，而其時窮學生的飲食中，已有缺少滋養品之虞。何况近年來物價飛漲至數百千倍之鉅，許多家庭，維持柴米，已覺困難，或以二粥一飯充飢，或以玉蜀黍加米同煮。明知食物中。養料旣不佳良，又不充足，但苦別無善策；即豆腐豆腐乾之類，亦比戰前肉價高貴多倍。助學金貸學金等善舉，幫他們過一難關，尙有許多經濟難關，殆難盡述。不待指導與勸吿，他們已知養料的重要，惜乎此輩學生與其家庭自身，力不從心，幾如涸轍之魚。</p>
<p>據報紙所載，失業工人與失業童工，有月可得免費麵粉數十斤。但須知貧窮苦幹，减衣節食的學生，將來對於社會與世界的服務，其重要未必不及今天的普通工人，而補助一學生營養食料所費者，更遠遜救濟一失業工人之所需。</p>
<p>現代國家注重敎育，同時亦注重學生養料。英美等邦，體重不及標準的學生，可飲免費牛乳，其費全由政府與善士捐助；辦理以來，有利無弊。無論在戰前或戰後，英美學生比較的經濟稍寬裕，然彼邦早已實行補助學生以營養食料。吾國亦宜急起直這。</p>
<p>上海報界與各界賢士合作，舉辦助學金數次，成效卓著，而目前則社會各界且合力共組貸學金委員會，力事推進，吾以爲關於補助學生營養食料，亦宜乘此時際，羣策羣力，切實合作。實行數月之後，若成續確佳，則踴躍捐助者，必將不限於本地本國。而此極重要而被疏忽的一軍，亦可獲得到營養食料的補助。</p>

<h3>本埠金融與商業　一週經過槪要　證券漲風最激烈　商品亦漲多跌少</h3>
<p>上週本市金融，因陽曆年頭，游資供過於求，投機家乘勢利用，向各市塲橫衝變觸，引起軒然大漲風，統債·華股·外股·紗·花·布·人絲·生絲·針織·綢織·麵粉·食糖等，均有嶄新的高價發現，惟國內停戰令已頒，及中國紡織建設公司陸續開售棉紗，與接收物資如油·糖·肉·魚等之不斷售出，吸收通貨數量亦甚鉅，如當局確無與民爭利之意，則此種逢高拋售國貨之政策，確可穩定人民對於法幣之信仰心，並可减殺高物價投機主義之狂熱。</p>
<p>金融　上週銀錢業千元日拆，呆定於三角，暗拆視地位與信用而異，有低至六分者，有高至大一角二分者，烚赤因東北平津昆明金價高於滬，及美匯尙未掛出，市勢在八二至八七小盤旋，最後站八十五萬一千元，比前週漲五萬四千元，美鈔先傳美方限制入口，及輸入商不收鉅額而跌，旋因錢兌業與廠商買進回堅，週尾收盤一千四百四十元，較前週漲三十五元，美匯雖未公佈，惟輸出商所得國外貨款匯票，已可自由存儲外國及自由支配，最近出口生絲·茶葉·髮網·草帽·猪業·即如此，港幣老貨港粵幫售出，價平，錢兌業與證券幫進新貨，且傳新老比率二作一之說，高峯見九十元，結果比前週漲十五，六元。</p>
<p>證券　統債因停戰令已下，及和平統一將實現，整理與換金公債之傳說，銀行帮與投機家猛進，丙種高峯達一千三百五十元，證券司業與老多頭售丙種，套買丁種戈這，致丁戈亦突越一千元大關，結果比前週暴漲四百十五元（丙）至五百三十五元（丁），華股因宋院長有振興工商業談話，及杜月笙主持證交復業消息，投機鉅戶朱某王某與金商廣幫大批購進，尤集中於熱門股永安紗廠，以一千三百八十元新高價收盤，較前週暴漲四百元，其餘大小各股亦均跕嶄新高價，文化老股之商務印書館已高至五萬一千元，外股因傳本市將關自由港，及英商輪船公司簽河行駛合同，外僑與銀錢業證紗帮大批購進，漲風甚厲，衆所時代之領袖股會得豐尤俏，一度突破一萬元大關，比前週猛漲二千五百元，其餘地產股工業股亦均見新高價。</p>
<p>貨物商品方面，食米蕪湖內地到貨多，價受麵粉刺激，益以天津靑島等帮採購薄稻米，價比前週漲一千元至一千五百元，麵粉福建漢口汕頭南洋等帮購進，一號砲車粉每包高至四千元，較前週漲四五百元，雜糧中黃豆因油廠需要殷切，每祖漲三四百元，生仁因舊歷年關暢銷，每担漲二三千元，專銷外洋之大粒乾生仁已高至二萬六千元，豆餅因台灣汕頭頻購，每片漲三四百元，可供燃料用之棉餅，每片五十斤，售二千五百元，食油寗波帮及本街用戶購進，每担漲四五千元，平價菜油曾以一百二十五元每人買一市斤，但市上豆油仍上升至二百七十元，砂糖因冬令年節需要，蚌埠寗波蕪湖北帮採購車白及綿白糖，廠方供不應求，雖有平價中砂以三百六十元供售，每担仍比前週漲四五千元，棉織品先因布廠搜求，四二支藍鳳猛騰至一百五十萬元，二十支雙馬九十萬元，旋因中國紡建公司每日拋售紗綫二三百包，益以海關禁運香港，結果反比前週跌九萬元至十四萬元，棉布本街暢銷，染廠搜購白坯細布，四川蚌埠等帮採辦藍布，每疋漲五六千元，棉花因紡建公司及榮豐紗廠等盡量收買，通州美種花每担高至九萬五千元，旋因紗市挫跌及美棉進口稍軟，其餘茶葉有洋莊與北帮銷路，肥皂洋燭火榮有用漢幫採購，香烟則因派貨不斷及烟兌業回復市塲交易，市價先俏後疲。</p>
<h3>竹節鋼條活躍　新盤元轉好</h3>
<p>竹節錭條原爲建築五金中之繁銷品，自勝利以後，執貨者皆以爲實銷將盛，可以待價而沽，豈知建設工作進行殊緩，故此貨銷路遲遲未動，直至最近，進出始忙，蓋由於建築帮之採辦，終以存貨較富，因此價格仍未見如何轉好，目下每噸沽二十二三萬元</p>
<p>本廠貨二分新盤元，前因缺貨，曾一度高至五十餘萬元一噸，其後廠家續有出品，而實銷頗呆，故回瀉甚爲劇烈，晚近漸呈轉機，每噸喊二十五六萬元，然與最高峯相較，尙不及半數云。</p>
<h3>染織業改訂新價</h3>
<p>染織業公會染色組，召集小組會議，討論染價問題，前經決議之價格，實因顏料全恃本市廠號所有，燃料猶無充沛來源，廠繳日益增高，難維血本，故另擬就新價目表，定今日公布施行。</p>
<h3>美棉出口數　市價見疲</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十三日電〕昨棉市開盤漲一鎊音，嗣跌五鎊音，上落不一，其後市面相當活潑，因新棉交割與罷工消息不利，一般市價均微落，拋空希望較厚，多頭觀望，加以週末關係，成交稀少，交易者對於繼續反對所擬限價之事，頗予注視，給果老棉略挫，新棉脚力穩定，仍高起十四鎊音。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十三日電〕美棉出口量，至本年七月底止，可達三，五〇〇，〇〇〇至四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇包，去年出口量爲二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇包</p>

<h3>對上海紡織界的希望</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>世界新紀元，跟着新的時代旋轉！一秒一分不停地換上新的姿態！後退的「淘汰」！前進的「生存」！這是「天演公例！」誰也不能逃此定律的，筆者厠身紡織業逾十七年，寢饋於斯，際茲新歲，竊願貢其千慮一得之愚。</p>
<p>不能否認，過去的上海紡織少，似乎一盤散沙，缺乏聯緊，界團結性，在中國抗戰之前的日寇紗布廠，無論在技術方面，產銷方而，管理方面，經濟方而，都佔着絕大的優勢！他們一方面藉不平等條約作虎符，一方面有政府財力作後盾！紡錠之多，技術之種，所以他們的紗也布也，都會風行到我們每一個窮鄕僻壤！像藍鳳紗龍頭細布，幾乎婦孺皆知，人手一紮，人購一段，敵商吸收我們每一個同胞的經濟血液，無孔不入，有人說：「我們不是也有說多不多，說少不少的我們自己的紗廠布廠嗎？」可憐，迫於外來的不平等條約約束縳，政府無力扶助，陷於內傷的技術和管理的落後，散沙無法團結，於是臥楊之畔，任人酣睡，形成喧賓奪主之勢，而莫可救藥，待抗戰軍興，有東方紐約之譽的上海工商大市，終於淪陷敵手，斯時也，是民族工業忠奸分野的試金石，（此固不獨民族工業爲然，）幾許工廠，是寗死不屈，幾許工廠投順在魔掌手裹，忝顏合作，或紡紗或織布，或代製軍服，而甘願作虎倀，這是中國民族輕工業史上的恥辱，這是我們輕工業界不可洗雪的永遠汚點，但是我想眞眞投順到魔掌手裏的敗類，或者是少數，大多數具有「國家至上」「民族至上」信念的，懷抱天良的工業家，或者被迫於不可抗力的威脅環境，或者爲了苦心維特職工們生計的垂絕而走上了末路，但是，天亮了之後的黑白分明，是沒法掩滅的，忠是忠，奸是奸，涇渭分明，纖屑學露，回溯以往敵商藉暴力的種種壓迫，種種侵略，和我們自己的處處頹喪，處處不爭氣，我們是痛定思痛，諺云「從前種種蠶如昨日死！今日種種譬如明日生！」我們從此應該激發理智的「自我檢討」一下，從檢討中，產生出新的光明的希望！埋頭努力於輕工業的再建設！敵寇早降服了！不平等條約約束縛也解除了！此後我們的錦繡山河，是我們自己的天地了！藏於地下的輕工業命脈的富庶煤鑛，我們應該怎樣投資開採，廣畝阡陌的我們紡紗織布所必需的原料——棉田——應該怎樣以集團的力量去散播優良的棉種，去計劃增加大量的棉產額，以及如何設廠製造紡織機械，如何設備發電機，自創原動力，如何埋頭研究紡織技術，使紗的拉力增强，品質高貴，生產率遞增，如何辦理勞工敎育，勞工保險，勞工娛樂，勞工福利，以增進勞費雙方的情感和堅强的團結！從今日上海紡織界現擁的政民雙方的二百萬紡錠額的發軔！逐漸擴展到二千萬紡錠，二萬萬紡錠，以至於二十萬萬紡錠的鵠的！這不是誇大的希望！「事在人爲」，何難「有志竟成」！即以二十萬萬的紡錠額，推廣到擁有三十餘省版圖的中國各地，估計最低人口額以五萬萬人計，也不過人各四紡錠而已，以中國人口衣著所需紗·布消費量之鉅，和將來預計紗·布出口貿易的活躍！二十萬萬紡錠之數尙覺渺乎其小！如何達到那鵠的？這是具有悠久歷史卓越地位和握有推動力量的整個上海紡織界的責任！</p>
<h3>全國復員聲中　首都敎育之各方面</h3>
<p>抗戰八年，首都敎育上之損失極大，今後整理改進，白需時日。茲就見問所及，將各方面敎育近情，略述於下：</p>
<p>敎部方面</p>
<p>敎部爲復員工作，先後已派部員多人來京辦公。部址仍在成賢街。該部為謀就近辦事迅捷起見，凡屬於京滬兩市及浙閩蘇皖贛五省之敎育應局文件，由南京敎育部主持負責人代拆代行，除非特要必須取決於朱部長者，始向渝請示後再辦。此外其他各省市敎育應局公文，則直接寄渝辦理。朱　先部長，朱經農次長，現均在渝。南京有杭立武次長代行部務。督學彭百川最先來京。現在各司負責辦事人，有社會司黃司長如今，兼任秘書，鍾科長靈秀，總務司徐帮辦維鑄，高等司馬科長繼援，中等司王科長味辛，國民司薛科長天漢，　藏司曾科長樹動等。至京滬兩市及五省敎育行政負責常局，敎部已決定：贛敎廳長仍係程時整，浙敎廳仍由許紹棣復員，蘇敎廳由前任敎部參事及行政院參事之陳石珍調任，皖敎廳長現爲汪少南，閩敎應自鄭貞文升任中央黨政方面委員後，巳兩次更動，滬市敎育局由曾任敎部政務次長之顧毓琇接任，京市社會局由陳劍如復員。</p>
<p>大學方面</p>
<p>中央大學原址，因駐有軍醫院，與防疫部隊，及疫苗血淸指導所，目前尙未全都搬讓，僅由該校接收委員會接收一部份，已接收者，大禮堂，體育館。即將接收者，爲醫學院，敎習房，附屬中學等。預計三十五年夏季，可以遷校復課。惟聞該校遷渝後，有學生四千餘人，比之戰前一千餘人，增加四倍。原來校舍，已感不敷應用。此外金陵大學校長陳裕光，聞會飛京視察一周即回渝，復校亦係暑後之事。金女大目前先辦附屬中學，然後再復員文理學院。敎部所主辦之臨時大學先修班，利用中大接收之房舍爲辦公上課住宿之用，由敎部簡任督學彭百川兼主其事。敎職員十餘人已聘定，（有陳傑大·金書樵·葉少農·薛無競·吳正維等），有學生九百人，分文理兩組，（文科包括文，法，商，敎育，理科包括理，農，工，醫），是大學預科程度，修習期限一年，修滿及格，可入正式大學一年級。該班約在本月初旬以內開學上課。又敎部主辦之臨時大學補習班，暫以舊金陵大學校舍爲辦公上課住宿之所，由王書林主其事。有敎職員數十人，學生二千餘人，按甄審程度，分一二三四年級，文理兩類各科齊備，惟因設備及內地人才尙未完全歸來關係，將醫學院學生，送人上海東南醫學院附讀。將工科三四年級學生，送入上海交通大學附讀。該班開課已三週，修習期限爲一年。所有一二三年級補習期滿成績及格者，可按級分別送入正式大學，插升一級。凡四年級能以修滿及格，即可認為畢業。以上所謂臨時大學先修補習，以修補一年了事，並非辦一臨時大學，甄審時，程度合格者，始派入補習班讀一年級，先修班則須多讀一年。</p>
<p>中學方面</p>
<p>敎部所主辦國立臨時中學三校，一校在龍蟠里，校長俞采丞。二校在三茅宮，校長沈祖懋。三校在竺橋。每校高初中各級學生，均在千人以上。此外京市府社會局主辦之中學，有市立一中·二中·三中·（三中係正始中學改屬），女中　與職業　中學，及簡易師範，共計六校。私立中學，有安徵·鍾英·鍾南·京華·冶城·東方·成美等。安徵在戰時移往屯溪，校長為姚文采，因南京原來校舍有所損毀，目前開辦級數不多，仍往來京皖間，雙方兼顧，徐圖整個恢復。鍾英，未嘗間斷，現由兪采丞代理校務。鍾南，校長喬一凡，來京後又赴渝，該校損失甚大，目前着手籌備，一時不易恢復。京華，校長傅况鱗，現爲建師，復校亦甚躊躇。冶城·東方，均已復校。成美，早經上課。敎會中學，有匯文女中·中華女中·明德·育羣·金陵中學·金陸女子文理學院之附中等校，均已復課。天主敎並設有利濟中學於碑亭巷。</p>
<p>市局方面</p>
<p>市社會局，因房屋未全部收回，暫隨市府在山西路辦公，較原來貢院適中地點，相距太遠，接洽未免不便。自陳劍如局長以次，總務由方科長負責，學校敎育由樂科掌理，社敎事宜，由吉德梁主任其事。市立中學，有男中三校，女中一校，簡師職中各一校。小學之分佈城市內及下關與城外者，現在約計六十餘校。向由教會辦理而接歸市管者，有富民坊，估衣廊，慈悲社，鼓樓等小學。戰前崔八巷，馬路街，淮淸橋，遊府西街，香舖營，中央路，倉頂，高井，漢西門，南昌路等小學，校舍全毀未設，校數因以減少。社會敎育，有第一第二民眾敎育館兩館，又圖書館一所，第一第二中心民衆學校兩校。戰前之歷史博物館及體育塲全毀，僅有九龍橋之游泳池，最近接收開放。各校館長之人選，已陸續調整，新派或加委已定。對於師資之愼選，已經過甄審考試，各校皆任用合格之師資。此後待遇提高，敎員可以自給，生活安定，於敎育效能，自有增進之希望云。（安）</p>

<h3>陸軍總部警備總部　即將會審姜公美　犯七大罪牽涉李澤</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前上海憲兵隊長姜公美在職時擅捕人民，私扣車輛，竊盜物資，藉端勒索，經人民迭向淞滬警備總司令部告發，偵查後證據屬實，於去年十月十二日奉令將該隊全部繳械解散，並將姜公美拘捕到案，正訊辦間，唯重慶憲兵司令部張司令來派衛處長持平到滬領回自辦，嗣因案情重大，奉委座電令着由淞滬警備總司令都依法嚴辦。</p>
<p>押解來滬即將會審</p>
<p>憲兵司令部遵於日前派中校組長曾建人連同案卷乘機押解來滬，交由警備總司令部軍法處審訊，該處經處長曾昭貽氏速日整理案卷後，業已準備提審，錢總司令爲昭鄭重起見，並電陸軍總都派員來滬會審，一俟到達，即可開審，茲將姜公美所犯罪狀略誌如下：</p>
<p>罪嫌多端牽涉甚廣</p>
<p>姜公美所犯之罪狀，計有從兵殃民三起，擅釋罪犯九起，非刑拷打五起，侵佔公物一起，盜取物資二起及其他舞弊共計七大罪，此外尙牽涉現正轟動全市之通敵嫌疑犯新新公司總經理李澤，在九月間亦曾以偽幣二萬萬元，汽車一輛向姜行賄。</p>
<p>藏匿物資查獲一部</p>
<p>至於其在職時秘密藏匿之物資，現在待各方檢舉，其中一部份已由上海區敵僞產業處理局查緝組查獲，計有棉布大小一百〇七件（約三千疋），又四百三十二疋，肥皂六十八箱，橡皮車胎大小一百三十四條，內胎十一箱，棉花一百十三件，木棉一百五十四包，西藥二十六箱，糖一百三十三包，螺絲板頭三十八箱，其他顏料，生絲·火柴·臘燭。硫磺等爲數已極可觀。</p>
<p>縱兵殃民擅釋罪犯</p>
<p>至縱兵殃民計有該部士兵搶刦業廣織造廠香烟六十二箱，勒架北站單帮金飾，刼掠王孝全布疋。擅釋罪犯，計共九起，（編者按：此項人犯警備司令部正擬重行緝捕，歸案究辦，該部切囑暫勿發表，故略。）</p>
<p>非刑拷打侵佔公物</p>
<p>非刑拷打計有木匠沈雲國，朝鮮前進報營業部職負安國烱，英美公司工人瞿忠華，漆匠胡芝庭等三人，侵佔公物，計有該部接收之滬南敵憲兵隊汽車數量內私自藏匿汽車三輛，寄存於國際汽車公司及劉志明處，盜取物資計有新閘小學封存之西藥二十七箱及其他重要物資，福大煤號汽油二十七桶，又查該隊對被押人犯及姓名從不登冊，而遇釋放人犯，則以「奉論開釋」，亦不書明理由，故深信該案審訊後，其所犯罪狀，當不止此數。</p>
<h3>檢舉項康元　高院簽發拘票</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕艦李澤後，康元製罐廠以理項康元，亦被該廠職工檢舉，指項曾任市諮詢委員等僞職，高檢處於十日曾飭傳項康元偵訊，項本人並未到案，僅由其妻具狀，以其夫不在滬爲理由，請求改期審訊。但高檢處以爲項不在滬之理由，毫無根據，顯屬有意規避，故已於前日簽發拘票，飭警迅予拘提到案，以憑偵究。</p>
<h3>美陸軍部長　柏德遜今日到滬　美軍總部準備歡迎</h3>
<p>美陸長柏德遜，定今日到滬，美軍總部已準備歡迎，並借用建設大厦十六樓品克將軍之辦公室，爲臨時會議室。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十三日廣播稱：美陸長柏德遜今抵朝鮮，定明晨飛上海。</p>
<h3>滬市學生　斥責法總領</h3>
<p>上海市學生昨爲法艦潛運戰犯案，發表維護主權運動宣言略謂：法總領不顧一切，將卡可平諾由法艦白爾丁號，私自載運赴西貢審判，事後竟表示此係地方事件，以圖减輕其本身罪狀，顯然地法總領事方面，毫無誠意接受市政府及外交部駐滬辦事處之抗議，不想對該事件作挽救的妥善措置，我們痛心地認識了他們的眞面目，我們要淸算，我們要求法國政府向我國道歉，並保證以後決不發生同樣事件。</p>
<h3>彈璜廠內　拘獲敵逃犯</h3>

<h3>遣送日僑返國　尚需半年</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者爲明瞭在滬日僑近况計，昨特走訪日僑管理處，承鄒副處長任之解答如下：</p>
<p>上海現有日僑七萬四千人，在虹口與其美路四個集中區內，自由居住，保甲組織完善，由自治會主理一切，直接受日僑管理處督導。歸國日僑至今僅四千餘人，因船隻困難，遣送時間，至少尙需五六個月。集中營內日俘，完全自治，雖有一部份戰俘在外做工，但均爲臨時遣派。至於如何利用日俘勞力以帮助復興建設，猶無具體計劃。</p>

<h3>虬江路地攤巡禮</h3>
<p>— 平齊</p>
<p>你如果坐一路電軍到北四川路虬江路口下車，一定遠遠就望得見鬨著一大堆人，擠在一片戰火燒完了的廢墟上面。這就是「虬江路的地攤」，許多上海人特爲從滬西或者南市趕來「塌便宜貨」的地方。</p>
<p>地攤的總數有一百左右，可是流動性很大，有時攤販之問互相買賣，那些舊貨便也就成爲「皮球」，被人們踢來踢去。這些舊貨的來源呢，一望而知，都是日本人的東西，但是你如果向攤販詰問怎樣買來，他們却從來沒有一個說是直接從日僑家裏買來的。貨物的似値相差極大，有的攤上祇有六七雙破舊的軍靴，十來件大衣但也有一個攤專賣木器。這個攤最考究，因爲牠還搭了一個瓦棚，可蔽風雨。他們出賣還沒有十分破舊的衣櫉，皮箱，沙法，寫字檯，五斗櫉等等，呌出來的價錢，決不比北京路的舊木器低廉。最引人注目的是那些日本女人背的彩袱，五色紛披，相當絢麗，可是虬江路上滿是塵土，斜陽的餘暉照着，你看得出牠們已褪去了當年顏色！</p>
<p>茶具和酒器也非常之多，但品質不佳。比較有意思的還是那些從他們本國帶來的東西，例如手工相當精巧的「人形」（玩偶）。還有幾座一尺來高的金紙小屏，雕鏤的工夫也頗有可觀。書籍幾乎完全沒有，有點出於意料之外。有一位女顧客選中了一條包袱，攤主人特爲替她把包袱摺成一小方，放進一只扁扁的長方紙盒。在他拿出盒蓋來時，我驀然在盒蓋上看見了端端正正寫着的兩個字——「國債」！日本的人民買了數目驚人的「國債」，今天軍閥和政客們所答報他們的就是如此！</p>
<p>起先，我聽說是日本人自己在擺攤，但結果發現攤主幾乎全是同胞，也許有一兩個是朝鮮人，因爲他們的口音有些奇怪。一個攤主吿訴我說，有幾個「舊貨客人」是每天來的，他們逢低便進，然後放在自己店裏的櫉窗裏高價出售。眞正能賺大錢的是他們，因爲他們的本錢大，而攤販因周轉不靈，往往被迫廉價出售，好的時候一天能賺幾萬法幣，壞的時候蝕本也是有的。</p>
<p>地攤上實在什麼都有，着的，用的，小孩子玩的，以及無綫電收音機，留聲機，牀帳，被褥，帽子，軍毯，皮箱，電料，洋裝之類都全……還有兩個麪攤，居然顧客　集，生意興隆，但是在這一大塊空地上，恐怕也祇有這兩個麪攤是「眞不二價」的。地攤上，往往討價的人要三千，還價的人祇出五百，而交易居然成功。</p>
<p>我擠出「重圍」的時候，正好有三四個手臂上纏着白布條的日僑走過。他們低下了頭，加緊着脚步——北四川路和虬江路一向是他們最熟悉的地方，而今天的景象是這樣，我很願知道他們作何感想。雖然田園「已」蕪，我倒還是希望他們早些回去，老實說，上海正鬧屋荒，虹口的幾千幢房子早就給他們住得太久了。</p>
<h3>參觀長治軍艦</h3>
<p>— 叔陶</p>
<p>江南造船所已經有很久遠的歷史了，這次的變亂使其外貌大爲更易。現在有三個船塢，長治軍艦便停泊在靠東面的一個，上面正有着五徘士兵，在立正稍息，不久便依次登岸。歡天喜地的北去了。他們黑衣白帽，極爲壯麗，眞令人羨慕。我走到一位兵士的而前，即將我的來歷說明明，請求允許登艦參觀。經其持名片轉達長宜，一分鐘後，即有一位步伐穩重，神采奕奕的年青軍官出來，我重新將來意說明，蒙其答應，並領我到各處參觀。</p>
<p>全艦官兵二百餘名</p>
<p>這位青年軍官是朱良銓中尉，揚州人，談起話來文質彬彬。我們走進會客室，室內佈置整潔简單。除舖着白布的台椅外，屋角還有個約二尺高，一尺寬的小牌樓，裘面有塊「天上聖母」的紅木牌，想必是日本軍艦的護符吧。我正待啓問，朱中尉已滔滔不絕的吿訴我一些關於這軍艦的情形。他說現在陳總司令常住在艦上。艦長鄧兆祥中校，副艦長程法侃少校，皆因公外出，現即由其負責一切。今天因適逢星期假日，左舷士兵自一時至五時，可以有四時的休息，右舷的士兵們則照常工作。全艦官兵共二百餘名，內日本技術人員共廿六人，正在辦理交代，不久便將被遣回國云。</p>
<p>長治艦是我國海軍接受敵艦中最大的一艘，原名是宇治砲艦，排水量一三五〇噸，以汽油爲燃料，速率每小時可駛二十海浬。它在一九四一年（昭和十六年）十月三十日就役，一九四二年十二月八日參加過香港攻略戰，一九四三年改爲長江艦隊的旗艦。後來因該艦隊損失過重，又將它改爲護航艦。由此可知那時候敵人艦隊已到山窮水盡，不戰自敗的時候了。</p>
<p>武裝設備頗為完善</p>
<p>長治艦的武裝有十二時主砲三門，２４－ＭＭ，機關砲九門，深水砲一門。去年五月間，敵復裝有雷達一部（日本名呌電探。）抗戰勝利，敵人無條件投降後，我國海軍於九月十三日正式接受該宇治砲艦，而改名爲長治軍艦。艦上一切設備絲毫未遭破壞，雷達自裝置起以迄投降僅有四月餘，可說是接受敵軍艦中設備最完善的一艘了。</p>
<p>長治艦自接收後，改編爲海軍第二艦隊的旗艦，有五艘軍艦歸長治艦指揮。在雙十節駛往南京，經過江陰的時候，有新四軍從江兩岸砲擊該艦，一彈射在艦尾五十味之外，未能射中。在十月底曾派到台灣去對敵海軍受降，先至厦門。陳總司令紹寬乘機至廈門，再由廈門乘長治艦往台灣之台北甚隆及琉球羣島之馬公各港口。一月前返滬，因艦底須加修理，所以到滬後，即入江南船塢。將來出塢以後，或者到靑島，或者駐防長江一帶，現尙未定。朱中尉的話至此吿一段落，這時他就領我去參觀全艦各部。先這次戰爭未用着，他們白廠許多心機，結果還是失敗，窮兵　武的下塲如此。</p>
<p>參觀舵樓無缐電室</p>
<p>離開朱中尉室個五六方尺的小室，四圍羅列羅盤五座，兩旁長治軍艦原係從敵方接收來的最大軍艦之一。最近爲要修理，停泊在江南造船所。艦上一共有二百多個員兵，武器的裝配，和一切設備，都很完善。長治艦現在是一艘旗艦，由她統帶的有五艘兵船。圖中大砲具有相當威力，前爲艦長鄧氏。到總司令室，佈置整潔壯麗，當巾橫置紅氈長桌，兩旁列着椅子，兩端是紅沙發，西南角是總司令的寢室。出來便是艦長·副艦長。參謀。各辦公室。後又進朱中尉室，每室皆有無綫電播唱書樂，朱中尉開了放毒面具對我說，這也是敵人留給我們的，可惜有二個二尺長的望遠鏡。我就好奇的探視了一下，結果望出去糢糊非凡。朱中尉笑着對我解釋，這是因爲前面玻璃窗折光的原故，所以才看不淸楚呢。他又指着旁面的四挺機槍，口徑24-M.M.火力相當强烈。由此下梯到前面甲板上，有口徑１２吋主砲二門，射程一萬五千咪。後邊有四大　以備急用的砲彈，每箱備有長　二尺餘砲彈十二枚。再後即是備彈庫，可用機器由艦身取出，轉至艦中。他指着雷達給我看，又指着無綫電室說，那裹或者更有趣味，因為擴音筒正在播送義房軍進行曲。我們便踏着興奮的少伐，走向無綫電室。該室設備複雜，有無綫軍機六座，電報機電話機等，和許多電綫，看得我眼花撩亂。退出無綫電室，經到船的後方去參觀深水砲，外形好似一個牛角形，砲身二尺許，它的用法也很奧妙，是潛水艇的敵手</p>
<p>這時候已經兩點鐘，當然朱中尉是很忙的，所以我也不敢多躭擱，便想吿辭。但朱中尉又親切的讓到會客室坐了，贈送海軍用五十瓦的熱量食（日本名）二盒，這是一種帶有椰子味的糖。並誠摯的告訴我，中國的海軍正在萌芽時期，正需呀為國人的重視和好的關懷。我們有這樣長的海岸機，我們面對着世界最大的海洋，我們有四萬萬五千萬的同胞，而我們的海軍却孱弱得如此。中國的海軍，就在乎我們中國人是否有要它強大的決心。最後朱中尉希望大家不要忘記，建設龐大的海軍，以維持世界永久的和平。正談到這裏，傳達兵忽然進來報吿，鄧程二位艦長回來了。於是又引我去見鄧艦長，經過介紹，便同往甲板攝影留念，旋即辭歸。</p>

<h3>談「生活藝術化」</h3>
<p>— 宋壽昌</p>
<p>「生活藝術化」是新生活運動的三大目標之一，所謂「生活藝術化」的意義，就是要使我們的日常生活充滿着美的感情，換句話說：我們的生活要感覺有趣味。藝術的本質就是美，美能使人類發生快感，所以藝術的生活，也可說是美的生活。</p>
<p>愛美是人類崇高的天性，自然界佈置着美的環境，如江上的淸風，山間的明月，閒花野草，松淸泉聲，無一不是美的圖畫，美的音樂，這種自然美到處皆是我們可於空間上及時間上去尋求趣味，由美的刺激而感受精神的愉快。一般人以爲決定我們的行爲是理性與意志，其實這見解是錯誤的，人類的行爲的原動力是感情，我們要有良好的行爲，必須先有優美的感情，而培養感情最有顯著效果的便是藝術。如果我們精神的生活與藝術沒有關係，那末感情生活必致萎缩，就發生人生可悲的惡結果，一切的邪念和不正當的行爲便因之發生了。</p>
<p>藝術旣能彌補人生的缺陷，解除人生的痛苦，要使大衆受享美的生活，生活趨於合理化，唯有提高人類最高精神活動的藝術，注重藝術的修養。我國古來治理國家，敎化人民，有賴於藝術的感化的很多。如周禮裏所說：「養國子以道，乃敎之六藝，一曰五體。二曰六樂，三曰五射，四曰五御，五曰六書，六曰九敎」。又如周代明堂的四周牆壁，盡有堯舜，桀，紂的容像，及周公相成王等圖，以爲國家興廢的鑒戒，這都是利用藝術的功能來帮助治理國家的事實。可惜自漢代以後，繪畫與音樂變成了文人雅士抒情遺興的東西，而失去了敎化的作用。</p>
<p>我國自抗戰勝利之後，正向建國的大道邁進，爲提高國民的道德與人格，最近又展開了新生活的運動。「生活藝術化」則列在三大目標的第一，我們便應該把藝術的運動來建設精神的生活。如美術館，博物館的設立，舉行展覽會及音樂演奏會，廣播音樂，遍設公園，都市建設的藝術化，都是予大衆接觸藝術的機缘。其他如含有社會敎育意味的戲劇及電影，也都是與精神生活有關的。</p>
<p>藝術不是有閒階級的裝飾品和娛樂品，也不是有閒階級所專有的，藝術應該為大衆所享受，以藝術的陶冶，使國民得到美化的生活，實現藝術化的生活於衣·食·住·行的各項。不過所謂藝術化的生活，並不是華美奢侈的生活，祗要合乎簡單·樸素·整齊·淸潔的條件就行，這種生活，才是新生活運動所提倡的「生活藝術化」的眞諦。</p>
<h3>「聽天由命」</h3>
<p>— 中一</p>
<p>中國人典型的人生觀是一種極端的樂天主義，這種主義的特徵，可以說完全包括在一句成語裏，就是「聽天由命」。「聽天由命」這句話當然是大家聽慣了的，但是很少人相信這四個字竟代表了一種哲學，一種主義，並且，還是一種「典型」的國粹人生觀</p>
<p>我們不妨觀察一下，看看國人們在極度困苦，危急萬分的時候，將如何去應付他們的環境？這裏，我可以吿訴你，大部分的人都是：安閒地笑一笑，說一聲：「不妨事，聽天由命好了！」了事。因爲他們相信即使在「福無雙至，禍不單行」的原則下，命運壞到要「焦頭爛額」的時候，也總會「天無絕人之路」而「逢兇化吉」的！所以，「讓牠去！」「不要急！」便不期而然的滑出口來了。</p>
<p>固然在危急的時候，不得不聽之於天命，但在安逸的時候又何嘗不呢？你聽到過「窮靠富，富靠天」這句話嗎？可見安逸的富人也是「聽天由命」的。於是，到處都是「聽天由命」之徒；學生進考塲，說是「聽天由命」，農夫等雨水，也說「聽天由命」窮人沒錢請醫生，更是「聽天由命……。</p>
<p>「聽天由命」是表示樂觀，但是太易趨於消極，希望「聽天由命」的人不要忘記一句話：「人定勝大」！</p>
<h3>野果及其他</h3>
<p>— 洪野</p>
<p>野果</p>
<p>野生的果子是美好的。</p>
<p>我常憧憬着那殷紅的顆粒，與綠色的菜片所構成的單純的色素的美質。我想，假使我把它放在嘴里細細的咀嚼將是多甜美呵！</p>
<p>於是，我終於把它採撷下來了；我欣賞於它的美色，並且把它咬開……</p>
<p>呀！苦澀的味兒。</p>
<p>這麼美麗的果子，原來它的滋味竟是如許之苦澀的。</p>
<p>靑春</p>
<p>人們爲綠色的生命高唱着靑春之獻的樂曲。</p>
<p>哭一陣；笑一陣；歡歌一陣；號啕一陣……靑春呵。把這些活躍的痕跡印在生之版上；付於豪華的生命的記錄。</p>
<p>靑春是可愛的；充滿以光與熱的。</p>
<p>但是，當我們走到了人生的黃昏的時候，我們有沒有感到一些空虛的過去呢？或是無端的踐踏了靑春樹的葉子。</p>
<p>懷念</p>
<p>天天，你跑到江邊去看水。</p>
<p>你說：「滾滾的江水呵！願你掀起巨浪，把我友載到滬濱。」</p>
<p>然而，巨浪起了又落；落了又起，並沒有給你帶來半點友情的消息。於是你失望了，你申訴以後將不再向江水默禱。</p>
<p>但是朋友，當內心感到空虛的時候，世界上有什麼事情會比失去了精神的寄託更可惆悵的呢？</p>
<p>懷念是一種煩惱，但止於懷念不會更痛苦嗎？</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛　（四）</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>墨老爺只是四十歲的人，可是已經蒼老得像六十歲。而且身體也壞得很，本來就有一種先天的貧血病。常常鬧頭暈；這半年，又加上咳嗽症；越發的顯得衰弱了。這原因，一半是生活水準驟然降低下來，有些受不住；一半是精神情緒不好，影響了健康；可是墨太太對於這兩種原因，都極力否定；她說全是因為墨老爺年輕時候太荒唐了，所以把身體糟踐　了。</p>
<p>墨太太的話，不是絕對沒肩理由，墨老爺年輕的時候，也確是玩兒得厲害。一年前，墨老爺在北京，還經常出入於幾家高等的「書寓」。墨老爺的大宗銀子，都送進了這個沒底兒的　裏。這些，墨太太全知這，也正因爲這個緣故，墨老爺有把柄在墨太太的手裏，所以墨老爺始終有幾分「懼內」。</p>
<p>說起來，墨老爺還是皇親國戚嘿！大槪他的祖母吧，是什麼「公主」之類的人物，他管慈禧太后，呌「外祖公」。因此，他也便被列為貴族階級，雖然系統很遠。</p>
<p>少年時期的墨老爺，是一位十足玩世的花花公子。憑了點兒聰明，二十歲頭上，進了秀才。後來，又憑了點兒朝廷上面的關係，作了幾任不大不小的官兒。在墨老爺的宦海生涯時期，可以算得是榮華當貴享受盡了！那當兒，他絕沒有餘暇慮及後來，在他的意識裏，這個世界，不會屬於別人。</p>
<p>好像墨太太倒有遠卓之見，可也是情勢逼成功的。她在墨老爺最走紅運的時候，爲了看不慣墨老爺整天價花天酒地；揮金如土；便同他大鬧了一次，然後毅然決然帶了剛滿五歲的兒子寳鈴；離開北京。遷到長江上游，湖北境地的荆州城內。這是四年前的事兒。</p>
<p>荆州已經變成了一個旗族移民據點。因此墨太太在這兒並不寂寞，兼親帶故的人不少，他們帮助墨太太從漢人手裏買了宅子—就是現在還住着的一座四合院的房屋，和幾十畝田地。墨太太有幾分男性，所以她很勇敢地獨立建設起來一個簡單的家，她也曾經常從墨老爺那兒得到些銀子度日，但她並不向墨老爺透露半點求助或乞憐的意思。她非常自尊，她具着一般女人所沒有的剛强與固執；她沒有智識，可是她明事理；帥的感情很豐富，但當她的感情受到戳傷以後；她變得冷酷；孤僻她的心是善良的，她同情和她同命運的人；她對所懷恨的一切，可毫不客氣；甚而報以打擊！</p>
<h3>友與敵　外一章</h3>
<p>— 但尼</p>
<p>他們是朋友，還是敵人？</p>
<p>在偉大的盛筵上，他們高舉酒杯互祝健康。</p>
<p>他們表現了至高的友愛。</p>
<p>而盛筵一散，他們却運用了各自狠毒的手段，企圖消滅對方。</p>
<p>他們是朋友。他們也是敵人。</p>
<h3>勝利章</h3>
<p>這是一個V形的勝利章。</p>
<p>卑劣的銅質却一樣也閃耀了黃金色的勝利的光輝。</p>
<p>是誰把它失落了？</p>
<p>是這勝利章的代價太低廉了吧，你才輕率地把它捨棄？</p>
<p>孩子，你過來，我給你佩上這勝利章！這只有你才配佩有的勝利章呵！</p>
<h3>湖上雜詩</h3>
<p>— 若瓢</p>
<p>西風吹過段家橋，曾記紅　送酒瓢，襄柳如人今亦改，一篷絲　兩蕭蕭。</p>
<p>漿撥枯波揚却　，西湖處處是酸辛，胡蹄踏爛閒花草，破閣登臨第一人。</p>
<p>鐵骨蒼蒼撑水涯，孤山鶴夢十年賒，歸來領取天心白，布　風淸日未斜。</p>
<p>渡水鐘聲帶曉寒，鳳林霜葉已微丹，荒鴉點點湖波重，負手船頭自耐看。</p>
<h3>晚歸</h3>
<p>— 畢西昌</p>
<p>黯澹的夕陽，紅得可憐；無情的暮靄，籠罩着大地，消滅了落日的餘焰。</p>
<p>我拖着沉重的步伐，一路踏着落葉，摸索在岑寂的深巷中，不見一個人影，我已陷入了黑暗和陰森的重圍，前途充滿着恐怖和險惡。</p>
<p>凜冽的西北風，又在任性地怒吼着，但是沒有一個人，能理會它。</p>
<p>刮上我淸　的面龐，打了個寒噤，淸新了我的頭腦，它好像給我一個啓示，在這冷酷的世界，惟有運用我的理智，燃起生命的火，打破灰色的夢。</p>
<p>我會心地微笑起來，吐揚了一口氣，把內心的溫暖，擊潰了當前的寒意。</p>

<h3>大家第一</h3>
<p>— 吳仭之</p>
<p>據說，今年應該是「建設年」了。於是，敎員說敎育第一，工業家說工業第一，交通界說交通第一，還有從事整理經濟的人提出經濟建設第一，倡導農村建設的提出農村建設第一……似乎大家都在趁着建設年的開始，競爭工作發靭上的第一位。這顯得多麼地紛亂！</p>
<p>在邏輯的觀點上說，這種第一的現象是很滑稽的。我也第一，你也第一，他也第一，結果是大家第一，也就是大家都失去了第一。</p>
<p>然而，大家都在重視着自已的崗位，這應該說是極好的現象。</p>
<p>然而，眞正的工作競爭者，有如長距離的競走家。他不作起步時的計較，而只爭取最後目的底抵達第一。</p>
<p>這種紛繁的「××第一」的提出，正是中國目前「千創百孔」，「百廢待舉」的現象的反映。也正是大家已經見到這點而且正在手忙脚亂地要想出來搶救的現象的反映。這也不能說是壞現象。問題只在：忙亂之中非但不能你碰我，我碰你，而且還得你帮我，我帮你。這却和競走家的爭取抵達第一有些不同。</p>
<p>大家在爭取他的抵達第一，應該各有各的完成的先決條件。我們假使在這許多條件項下，能够找出一項共同的先決條件，那末這個條件也許就是眞正的××第一了。</p>
<p>什麼是共同的先決條件？我說是政治上軌道！什麼敎育，工業，交通，經濟建設，農村建設，……都得讓位。還是政治上軌道第一！</p>
<p>我說政治未上軌道，並非就是政府塌了台。相反的，正說明了政府此後仔肩之鉅！</p>

<h3>滬西區的衛生問題</h3>
<p>— 馮煥全</p>
<p>目前滬西平民的一大痛苦，是臭氣四溢的汚水問題。滬西是貧民集中地，尤其勞動階級，無資租屋，乃採搭棚一道，於是東一簇，西一團，至於衛生方面，言之痛心，垃圾堆積如山，日久無法再堆，遂向附近小河浜傾倒，待小河塡滿後，貧民羣起搭棚。最感痛心的，地主見此有利可圖，竟也設法造屋；如此之下，陰溝早已成了嚴重問題，再加塡河搭屋，好此雪上加霜。另一方面，滬西區最多小型工廠，此種廠方，皆不顧公衆衛生，祇想出品牟利，因此不管陰溝有何出處，儘將汚水傾出，淹積平地，骯髒汚穢，臭氣四溢。筆者舉一個例，如白利南路某藥廠後面墻脚邊，及某紡織工廠門前等等，該處居民唯一的辦法，塡磚作道；但晚間，該處暗無燈光，行人時有失足事件；足佔着汚水後，即染上皮膚之疹，以事實而論，滬西區什九係貧民，焉能負擔這意外的藥費呢？本來窮人唯一的資本，是身體健康，所以深望工務衛生兩局，迅速以治標治本兩方策同時推進，增加實際工作効率。如流通陰溝，是當然的問題，塡平之河流處，則須統盤計劃改善；其他各處平地垃圾汚水，應趕快掃除，棚戶集中處，亦應增設衛生設備，或衛生宣傳等。希望這一建議在短時期內即能見諸實行。</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Military Mediation Department Imminent; Three Commissioners Arrive in Beiping by Special Plane; Determined to Cooperate Sincerely to Complete Mission</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 13th Dispatch] Military Mediation Executive Department Commissioners Zheng Jiemin (Government Representative), Ye Jianying (Communist Party Representative), and Robinson (U.S. Representative) and their entourages departed from Baishiyi Airport at 8:00 AM on the 13th by special plane directly to Beiping. The Military Mediation Executive Department will be established in Beiping within days. Colonel Berlute, Director of the Executive Group of the department, flew to Beiping the day before yesterday to prepare for the establishment of the department.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th Dispatch] Zheng Jiemin, the government representative to the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, Ye Jianying, the Communist Party representative, and U.S. Representative Chargé d'Affaires Robinson and a party of fifteen people arrived in Beiping from Chongqing at 4:00 PM on the 13th. That evening, Zheng Jiemin met with reporters at his official residence at the Beijing Hotel and made the following statement: I have been ordered by the government to undertake the mission of the Military Mediation Executive Department. I will follow the policy of President Chiang of the National Government to complete unification and unity with sincerity, cooperate sincerely with U.S. Representative Mr. Robinson and CCP Representative Mr. Ye Jianying, and complete the mission. The mission of the Military Mediation Executive Department is to supervise the cessation of conflict, restore transportation, and repatriate Japanese prisoners. Its organization consists of Commissioners Robinson, appointed by the U.S., Zheng Jiemin, appointed by the National Government, and Ye Jianying, appointed by the CCP. An Executive Group is established under them, with U.S. Colonel Berlute as the director. Cai Wenzhi will undertake the Executive Group's tasks on behalf of the government. The CCP's candidate for the Executive Group will be announced after consulting Mr. Ye Jianying. Future work of the Military Mediation Executive Department will be announced to the public from time to time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th Dispatch] Ye Jianying made a brief statement to reporters at the Beijing Hotel on the afternoon of the 13th: This is my first time in the old capital. I just looked down at Beiping from the sky and deeply felt that its reputation is well-deserved; it is indeed our country's greatest city. This time, the three commissioners and I came to the north to be responsible for the work of the Executive Department and are determined to work in a spirit of cooperation and take unified action. After the Political Consultative Conference opened in Chongqing, the atmosphere at the venue was very harmonious, and the prospect of peace is extremely optimistic. Today, peaceful nation-building is a unanimous demand of the entire country. We should immediately cease conflict, restore transportation, and engage in construction.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 13th Dispatch] Ye Jianying stated: As a result of the ceasefire agreement, he does not believe there will be any difficulties in the future for national army representatives to visit communist-controlled cities.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 13th Dispatch] Most of the personnel of the Military Mediation Executive Department have arrived here. The most important work of resolving China's internal conflict has begun today. Accommodation has been arranged for 125 Americans, 170 Kuomintang personnel, and 170 Communist Party personnel who are jointly participating in this peace effort. Officials at all levels, under the leadership of Colonel Berlute, military attaché and counselor of the U.S. Embassy, began work this morning in the building of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital.</p>
<h3>Fourth Session of Political Consultative Conference to Open Today; Discussion of United Government Plan; Five-Person Group Agreed on Scope of Agenda Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 13th Dispatch] The Political Consultative Conference will be adjourned today due to the weekly holiday, but the five-person group meeting will still be held for consultations. It was decided that the conference agenda would be divided into four topics: politics, military affairs, the National Assembly, and the draft constitution, to be discussed in sequence. The fourth session of the conference will be held at 3:00 PM on the 14th and will begin to discuss the first topic, the united government plan, in the political issues. Fierce debate is expected. The agenda for the days after tomorrow has not yet been determined. The five-person group will decide on the detailed program.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th Dispatch] The five-person group of the Political Consultative Conference, composed of members Chen Lifu, Dong Biwu, Chen Qitian, Liang Shuming, and Wang Yunwu, consulted on the agenda at 9:00 AM on the 13th and agreed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In accordance with the scope stipulated in Article 3 of the conference's rules, the agenda is divided into four categories: politics, military affairs, the National Assembly, and the draft constitution. The political category is further divided into two subcategories, A and B. A is the government organization, and B is the governing program, totaling five topics.</p>
<p>(2) Starting from the 14th, one category will be listed each day for general discussion at the conference. After a broad exchange of opinions, the chairman will designate a subcommittee to draft a report, which will then be proposed to the conference for consultation.</p>
<p>(3) Because the political category contains two topics, if the discussion is not completed in one session of the conference, it may be discussed again, and the remaining categories will be postponed accordingly.</p>
<p>(4) Each party will recommend one to two members for each subcommittee, to be designated by the chairman. Each person may serve on two subcommittees.</p>
<p>(5) News reporters will not participate in subcommittee meetings.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th Dispatch] The main agenda of the third meeting was to listen to reports from the government and CCP representatives on the process of their talks. Zhou Enlai, in his report, solemnly reiterated the CCP's recognition of the Three Principles of the People as necessary for China, the recognition of President Chiang's supreme leadership position in the country, the recognition of the Kuomintang as the largest party, and respect for its history and position in the revolution. He also acknowledged the National Government. In explaining these four points of recognition, he did not review the facts of certain instances of defying military orders and government decrees over the past eight years, nor did he review Zhu De's surrender orders from the Yan'an headquarters. Regarding the United Conference of Liberated Areas prepared in Yan'an last year, he gave various new explanations, believing that it was only a union of mass organizations and did not attempt to establish a national regime. When talking about the request for the government to recognize the liberated area regimes and armed forces established by the CCP, he stated that they could still be reorganized after recognition. Zhou Enlai's frank and sincere report won warm applause.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th Dispatch] Since the government and the CCP have held talks, why does military conflict continue and even expand? What are the reasons for the conflicts in recent months, and why were they not resolved during the talks? This is a question for the people of the whole country. Shao Lizi gave a concrete answer in his report on the 12th. When negotiations began on August 29, this point was not overlooked. The CCP proposed to cease all armed conflicts and wait in place. The government had to make military deployments for the surrender of Japanese forces and made many concessions during the negotiations. Finally, the government proposed to the CCP that as long as the CCP troops did not obstruct the National Army's acceptance of surrender, there would be no problem. However, this final proposal to guarantee peace was not understood or agreed to by the CCP, and this internal matter, which was not published in the minutes of the talks, bears the responsibility for two months of military conflict.</p>
<h3>Northeast Is Also Our Territory; There Is Absolutely No Reason for Autonomy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 13th Dispatch] The Northeast Residents Association here sent a telegram to the Political Consultative Conference and Special Envoy Marshall, opposing the proposal by certain circles in the temporary capital that the Northeast should be regarded as a special zone. It strongly stated that the nine provinces of the Northeast are an inseparable part of China, and there is absolutely no reason to grant them autonomous status. It went on to say: In the past fourteen years, all free Northeasterners have followed the leadership of Chairman Chiang, and their determination has not changed. The Northeast cannot be separated from mainland China.</p>
<h3>Ministerial Order to Carry Out Restoration Work; Zhou Jingyan Discusses North China Transportation; If the Ceasefire Order Is Thoroughly Implemented, All Railways Are Expected to Resume Traffic After Three Months</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 13th Dispatch] Regarding the preparation for the restoration of national transportation after the government and the Communist Party simultaneously ordered a cessation of military conflict, according to those in charge of the Ministry of Transportation, on the second day of the Political Consultative Conference, the Ministry of Transportation has issued an order to its subordinates to carry out various transportation restoration work. However, this work is of a comprehensive nature, and there are many aspects that need to be negotiated with the Communist Party. Therefore, in addition to issuing orders to all levels of institutions to mobilize and carry out restoration work, the Ministry of Transportation will have detailed measures. As for the military transportation on the Yangtze River, because the takeover of the recovered areas has not been completed, troops are still needed to go there. Therefore, this decision is subject to discussion by the Military Mediation Executive.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th Dispatch] The local transportation authorities have stepped up preparations for the restoration of transportation. Shi Zhiren, special envoy of the Ministry of Transportation in the Beiping-Tianjin area, was ordered to formulate a railway restoration plan. Telecommunications personnel who withdrew from Zhangjiakou have now registered and been screened by the Ministry of Transportation here and are prepared to be ordered to return to their original posts.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th Dispatch] If the order to cease conflict and restore transportation can be thoroughly implemented, then all railways in North China are expected to resume traffic after three months. Today, this reporter visited Zhou Jingyan, head of the North China Transportation Restoration Project Supervisory Group, and according to him, the situation of each road is as follows: (1) The Pinghan Railway south from Beiping can reach Yuanshi, but between Baoding and Yuanshi, it is often attacked and destroyed by Communist troops, so it cannot operate regularly. The situation between Yuanshi and Zhangde is unknown. It is rumored that the roadbed in that section has been completely destroyed, and the ten station houses have also been burned down. On November 8 of last year, the group had prepared the materials and planned to start repairs immediately, but it was suspended due to military changes in northern Henan. If the materials and manpower are fully prepared, it can be repaired in about one month under unobstructed conditions. (2) On the Jinpu Line, from Tianjin south to Dongguang, the sleepers between Dongguang and Lianzhen have been removed and destroyed in three places, totaling 1,130 meters. The destruction between Lianzhen and Jingguantun is the most severe. Not only has the roadbed been dug into ditches, but water has also been let in. The situation between Jingguantun and Yucheng is unknown. From Yucheng south to Gunzhou, the conditions are good. The conditions between Gunzhou and Liguo Station and the Linzao branch line are all unknown. No detailed report on the extent of the destruction of this road has been received, and it is impossible to estimate the time to repair. (3) On the Pingsui Railway, from Beiping west to Qinglongqiao, the area from Kangzhuang to Tianzhen is occupied by Communist troops. Communist troops travel from Huailai and end at Tianzhen. From Tianzhen via Datong to Huaiyuan, it was destroyed by Communist troops. This section is already being repaired. If the entire line is open to traffic, from Taiyuan north to Ningwu, the area between Ningwu and Huaiyun was destroyed by Communist troops. From Taiyuan south to Houma, the situation south of Houma is unknown. (5) On the Jiaoji Railway, Jinan can reach Zichuan to the east. Among them, the section from Dalinchi to Zhoucun was newly repaired this month on the 6th. The three places destroyed in the east between Lancun and Jiaoxian, between Gaomi and Fangzi, and between Yangjiazhuang and Zichuan Dian, have not been repaired due to a lack of materials. If sufficient preparations are made, they can be repaired in about half a month. (6) On the Beining Railway, Beiping can reach Jin County. Before long, military vehicles may be able to reach Dahushan. The railway tracks on this road are also sometimes destroyed. Overall, the restoration and preparation work for the railways in North China will take three months to complete. Before the issuance of the ceasefire order, the last large-scale attack by Communist troops on the Beiping Railway was on the morning of the 7th, from 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM, when the Communist troops attacked Changxindian. About 2,000 Communist troops participated. The railway police force suffered considerable casualties. The destruction of North China railways by Communist troops, obstructing communications, obstructing military attacks on stations, and other items, occurred 259 times in October, with November being the peak of destruction, totaling 606 times. December has gradually decreased to about 300 times.</p>
<h3>Safety of Three Roads' Traffic Still Awaiting Factual Guarantee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] From Xuzhou urgent telephone: After the ceasefire order arrived in Xuzhou and Zhengzhou, Director Gu Zhutong and Director Liu Zhi immediately and urgently ordered all departments to comply. The real effect of the issuance of the ceasefire order can be seen in the traffic situation three days later. Currently, the traffic safety of the Jinpu Xuji section is still under testing. The traffic safety of the Kai-Xu section of the Longhai Line and the section of the Pinghan Line north of Zhengzhou to Zhangde, a distance of 103 kilometers, must also await factual guarantees. After receiving the ceasefire order, the mission of the stationed troops and patrol teams along the aforementioned roads will be changed to protecting the roads. According to a certain road leader, it is premature to say that there are no more difficulties for the patrol troops in the future, but if the Communist troops keep their word and no longer destroy the railways, it will be easier for the patrol teams to distinguish between bandits and communists.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Arrives in the Capital; Bai Chongxi Returns to Nanjing to Meet Him</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi returned to Nanjing at 4:00 PM yesterday. Today, he personally went to Jiang'an to meet Chen Cheng, Minister of Military Administration, who came to Nanjing from Chongqing. One day after the Army Headquarters issued the ceasefire order, it received many telegrams of reply from various places, all expressing respectful compliance with the order. According to news from Yangzhou: There are still sporadic actions near Taixian County in northern Jiangsu, but the National Army aims to ensure Yangzhou and Taizhou, and even if the Communist troops are creating a false impression to cover their retreat, they will not pursue them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th Urgent Telegram] Minister of Military Administration Chen Cheng, traveling east from Chongqing on the warship Tongxin, arrived in Nanjing at 7:00 PM on the 13th. Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi and Zhu Yisu and others boarded the ship to welcome him. Minister Chen's stomach problems have recurred, and he has only partially recovered. It is reported that when Chen passed through Yichang, he witnessed a large gathering of people returning to their hometowns, and because of the lack of transportation and difficulties in evacuation, food and accommodation were problematic. He was very concerned and gave concrete instructions to the local officials to evacuate as soon as possible. He also believed that the current shipping on the Chongqing-Yichang section should be temporarily stopped at Shashi to reduce congestion in Yichang.</p>
<h3>Strengthen Security Along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] One day after the Xin'an incident on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, the speed of passenger trains has returned to normal, but passengers are still apprehensive. The security forces along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway have been strengthened, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government has strictly ordered all counties along the line to strengthen winter defenses to assist in the road protection mission.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo Arrives in Lanzhou; Scheduled to Fly to Chongqing Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 13th Dispatch] Special Commissioner Chiang Ching-kuo returned to Dihua from the Soviet Union on the 12th and flew from Dihua to Lanzhou at 4:00 PM on the 13th. He is scheduled to fly to Chongqing on the 14th.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Military Administration Borrows Three Professors to Go to the United States to Study National Defense Science</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 12th Dispatch] The Ministry of Military Administration recently borrowed Hua Luogeng, professor of mathematics, Zeng Zhaoyu, professor of chemistry, and Wu Dayou, professor of physics, from Southwest Associated University to go to the United States to study national defense science. Zeng is now in Beiping, and Wu and Hua are now in Kunming. All are planning to go abroad within March.</p>
<h3>Guan Linzheng Reportedly Going to Xinjiang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 12th Dispatch] Guan Linzheng, former commander of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters, is reportedly going to Xinjiang to take up an important position. Also, Mo Songheng, magistrate of Jiangchuan County in Yunnan Province, will soon go to Rehe to serve as secretary-general of the provincial government.</p>
<h3>The Temporary Capital of Beiping is Optimistic and Joyful; Gold and Commodity Prices Both Fall</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco Morning Broadcast on the 14th: According to a recent telegram from a foreign reporter based in Chongqing, although there are still technical problems to be resolved in the Political Consultative Conference, responsible persons from both parties have stated that all difficulties can be resolved through consultation. An optimistic mood permeates the entire wartime capital of China. Commodity prices have fallen by 10% to 15%, and hoarders cannot sell their goods. U.S. dollars and gold have also fallen.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th Dispatch] After the peaceful gospel of stopping conflict and restoring traffic was announced here, the people of the old capital raced to tell each other, and their joy was extraordinary. The price of gold plummeted from 87,000 yuan, which exceeded the price in Chongqing, to a low of 78,200 yuan. The closing price was 79,500 yuan.

<h3>Beiping and Tianjin Lack Judges; Courts Have a Lot of Backlogged Cases</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th Dispatch] The judiciary in Beiping and Tianjin is currently facing unimaginable difficulties, namely a lack of judges and lawyers.

Among the lawyers who did not appear in the puppet organization and have not lost their qualifications today, only Huang Shoufa. It is said that Huang had his lawyer registration canceled before the Anti-Japanese War and has re-registered today. Due to the extreme shortage of judges, the courts have a large backlog of cases. It is said that the number of prisoners held in the detention center of the local court was 600 at the time of victory, but has now increased to 1,132, all because of a lack of judges, so they are backlogged and have not been tried.</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Spokesperson Declares: Communist Troops in Shandong and Henan Continue to Attack, Expresses Regret Over Communist Party Newspaper Propaganda</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 13th] The Military Affairs Commission spokesperson issued a statement on the 13th, stating: Today's Chongqing Xinhua Daily published on its front page a news item stating that "Kuomintang troops in Rehe and eastern Hebei are destroying the order to cease the civil war," which is clearly propaganda. After the government representatives and the CCP representatives agreed on measures to cease conflict and restore transportation, this commission immediately telegraphed orders to all units on the evening of the 10th, instructing them to begin implementation immediately upon receipt of the telegram, and to fully implement it in all areas by 12:00 noon on the 13th. The transmission of this order was difficult due to the large number of units, congested lines, and communication difficulties, and it was naturally difficult for it to reach all of them immediately. Mr. Zhou Enlai also stated in a press conference on the 10th, in response to a reporter's question, that "a complete ceasefire will be in effect within three days, but perhaps some villages may still have sporadic fighting because the orders have not yet arrived." However, the newspaper did not clarify the time the order was issued or the communication difficulties, and even brought up the matter of the National Army entering Lingyuan on the 10th, and publicized it extensively. This was quite unexpected. Moreover, CCP troops are still launching large-scale offensives in southern Anhui and northern Henan. This commission has received reports from Director Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief Chen Daqing, Commander Hu Zongnan, etc., stating that: (1) The Communist Army New Fourth Army Chen Yi's 7th Division and the Lunan Military Region troops, totaling over 20,000, captured the Nanda Coal Mine in Zaozhuang, Lunan on January 11th, and carried out extensive destruction. (2) The Communist Army New Fourth Army troops continued to fiercely attack Lincheng and destroyed the railway. (3) The Communist Army 115th Division and 8th Division, totaling over 20,000 people, fiercely attacked the Jiawang Coal Mine (northeast of Xuzhou) on the 12th. (4) The Communist Army Taihang Military Region's Old Second Regiment, Old Seventh Regiment, Old Eighth Regiment, New Eighth Regiment, 41st Regiment, 45th Regiment, 98th Regiment, and the Hebei Detachment, totaling over 10,000 people, under the command of Zhang Hongyi, commander of the 7th Sub-district, besieged Xiuwu County in northern Henan and the Dazhifang south of the city on the 12th, with increasingly intense attacks in the afternoon. (5) The Communist Army Taihang Military Region's Li Da's 385th Brigade, 386th Brigade, New 1st Brigade, and the Jiluyu Military Region's Song Renqiong's 1st Regiment, 4th Regiment, 5th Regiment, 6th Regiment, 8th Regiment, 10th Regiment, 14th Regiment, 15th Regiment, totaling over 20,000 people, under the command of Wei Jin, commander of the 5th Sub-district, and Zeng Chengjin, commander of the 9th Sub-district, began besieging Anyang on the 12th, with clear intentions to occupy northern Henan. The government has remained silent about the large-scale offensives by the CCP troops mentioned above and has not made them public, merely showing tolerance and the government's determination to cease conflict, as it has not yet exceeded the prescribed time limit. However, the Communist Party newspaper Xinhua Daily has, on the one hand, ignored the fact that they are attacking government troops, and on the other hand, failed to acknowledge the difficulties in the arrival of orders, and claimed that government troops were violating the ceasefire order even before the jointly agreed-upon deadline for ceasing conflict (12:00 noon on the 13th) had expired. It seems that propaganda is being placed above national interests, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 13th] The General Headquarters of the Chinese Army printed 500,000 copies of Chairman Chiang's order to cease military conflict, distributed them by airplane to various locations, and then printed an additional 300,000 copies for distribution.</p>

<h3>The United States is Watching the Situation After the Reorganization of the Shidehara Cabinet, MacArthur Approves Japan to Hold General Elections</h3>
<p>[Reuters Tokyo, 13th] General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan, has approved the Japanese government to hold general elections at any time after March 15.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 13th] The State Department announced today that the US State Department is closely watching the situation after the reorganization of the Shidehara Cabinet. It also said that everything is in the hands of the capable MacArthur. The Dalton Commission, which is currently inspecting Tokyo, has nothing to do with MacArthur. Prime Minister Shidehara said last night that he had completed the reorganization of the cabinet, and as a result, five ministers, one deputy chief secretary, and one director of the Legislative Bureau have resigned. According to news received here, this cabinet tide is the first test of Secretary of State Byrnes' explanation of the Moscow Communiqué. Byrnes said that the clause that he had entered into the revocation of effect was only half a month ago. The clause that he inserted into the three reservations refers to the point that MacArthur's power cannot be interfered with or infringed upon in any cabinet tide in Japan. Byrnes said that after preliminary discussions with the representatives of the other three powers of the Four-Power Control Commission on Japan, MacArthur could take the necessary decisions on the successors of the Japanese cabinet members who resigned. If the Japanese cabinet were to resign en masse, MacArthur could also resolve the cabinet tide alone, announcing one cabinet member each day until all ministers were appointed. The Soviet Union has not yet informed the United States of its intention to join the Four-Power Control Commission, so the commission has never actually existed, and therefore MacArthur does not need to hold preliminary discussions with the other three powers in accordance with the Moscow Communiqué.</p>
<h3>American Soldier Drunk and Murderous, Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>[United Press, Osaka, 13th] An American soldier, on the eve of being transferred, got drunk in Nara and stabbed two Japanese people to death with a knife.

It is said that one hundred American Liberty ships are currently being sent to transport Japanese soldiers and civilians back to their country, at a rate of 100,000 people per month. These Liberty ships are now staffed with Japanese crew members, allowing 10,000 U.S. naval officers to be relieved of their duties. In addition, another hundred Liberty ships will be used for the same purpose.</p>
<h3>China's Economic Situation Improves, Trade Prospects Optimistic: U.S. Department of Commerce Report on Legal Tender</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] According to a report by the Department of Commerce: China's economic situation is gradually improving, and trade prospects are even more optimistic. Inflation has been curbed, and at the same time, foreign goods are continuously arriving, which has suppressed the prices of foreign goods. Several foreign banks in Shanghai have resumed operations one after another, and although it has not been clarified what their future functions will be, the supply of foreign exchange should be more convenient. The wartime trade control regulations have recently been relaxed, which has also contributed to the recovery of trade. Before foreign exchange transactions return to normal, it is necessary to store imported goods entrusted to foreign banks. In addition, the rampant petty theft and congestion in the dock and warehouse areas prevent trade from recovering quickly. Finally, the official pointed out that after the abolition of extraterritoriality in China, American commercial organizations in China will be subject to Chinese courts and commercial law in the future.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the General Assembly: Post-War London's Vitality Not Yet Recovered, Foreign Guests Eat and Sleep Uncomfortably</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] Representatives from 51 countries at the United Nations General Assembly are now meeting in Westminster. If the distinguished guests wish to dine in the nearby special dining room, it is difficult for them to satisfy their appetites because the rations are "strict" and there is no room for leniency. Moreover, all meals must be "self-service." There are only two dining rooms for representatives, secretaries, and visitors, so they are often full, and those who arrive later have to wait in a long line. Today's dishes are very simple and can also be seen as reflecting Britain's emphasis on "filling food" and the continued scarcity of luxury goods. The menu is meat pie or fish, boiled sweet potatoes that the British are accustomed to eating, and Brussels sprouts, which, like all British casual meals, are limited to three courses. However, even with such simple dishes, when the number of representatives and staff dining exceeds the amount of food prepared, it often has to be reduced. In a dining room on the fifth floor, the choice of food is slightly more, costing three shillings per meal. On the first floor, it only costs one shilling and sixpence. The difference is that there is meat pie upstairs, and downstairs there is British sausage, which is also stuffed with some fillings. However, representatives from various countries are not only allowed to eat strictly rationed food. Most of them live in large hotels in London, where there is always a considerable amount of delicious food to choose from.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 13th] Here are a few anecdotes from the first session of the United Nations General Assembly: (1) The Germans made a material contribution to the first General Assembly of the United Nations. The former German Embassy building in the UK is now the design headquarters for the delegations of various countries to the United Nations. (2) Due to the lack of hotels in London, many representatives were forced to share a room with two people, but one Danish representative was an exception because he admitted that he snored very loudly. (3) The Turkish representative enjoyed a special allocation of sugar because he could not swallow it unless he put four or five cubes of sugar in each cup of coffee. (4) London telephones have a conversion device for local and international calls, which is specially for the use of representatives from various countries, but the American representatives cannot talk to their friends in their own country because telephone workers across America are on strike.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress to Reconvene Today, Encountering Four Major Problems; Undersecretary of State and Treasury Secretary Broadcast Jointly, Urging the Public to Support the Loan Agreement to the UK</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] The Sunday Times today published a dispatch from Washington stating that the U.S. Congress is scheduled to reconvene tomorrow and will immediately encounter four major problems: the nationwide strike wave, the dispute between Congress and President Truman, the withdrawal of American troops from the occupied areas of Germany and Japan, and the loan to the UK. American newspapers published news of the labor unrest in large characters, which overshadowed international news. However, there is still hope for a resolution to the labor unrest by the end of the week. Regarding President Truman, his appeal to the public against Congress has so far received little response. Although he has not broken with Congress, he has almost no hope of controlling Congress on domestic issues, so that his policy of international cooperation has won public support, but he has not been decisive on domestic policies. Speaking of recovery, it is more valued by the public than the U.S. mission in Germany and Japan. Observers are very concerned about this issue and believe that this is the first major test of whether the United States is willing to fulfill its responsibilities in peacetime after the war. The American public is now aware that it is impossible to withdraw troops and at the same time ensure the fruits of victory. At the same time, the U.S. government has now begun the preliminary action of "selling" the loan to the UK to the American people. Assistant Secretary of State Acheson and Treasury Secretary Vinson have jointly broadcasted to urge the national public to support this move, but the opponents have made it clear that their line of attack will not be ignored. Acheson said in a broadcast on Saturday night that the loan to the UK is necessary for the U.S. foreign economic policy because it can promote the future economic prosperity of the UK. Acheson also said that the loan agreement was concluded out of mutual need and mutual benefit. Unless the UK can cooperate, world trade cannot be restored and expanded.</p>
<h3>American Troops Rise Up in Various Places, Demanding Demobilization</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a broadcast from San Francisco on the 13th, U.S. Chief of Staff Eisenhower declared at a press conference in Toronto today that the demonstrations by U.S. troops in various foreign countries show that they do not understand the importance of their mission in the occupied countries. The occupation of Japan and Germany is extremely important for the future peace of the world. U.S. troops around the world are continuing to demonstrate, protesting the slow progress of the American demobilization effort. In the China theater, General Wedemeyer recently praised his subordinates for their deep understanding of righteousness and for not taking such actions. However, even before his words had finished, 600 officers and soldiers immediately demanded to return to their country. General Wedemeyer has scheduled to talk to these officers and soldiers in detail on the 14th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, 12th] General McNair, commander of the U.S. forces in Europe, personally advised his troops today not to take further demonstrations, so that the number of U.S. troops participating in the demonstrations in the German occupation zone tonight has been reduced.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Millions of American soldiers returning from overseas have applied for admission to universities, and universities are overcrowded.

<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 13th] It was announced here today that U.S. troops in Korea have collected 2,100 yuan in 40 hours, preparing to place an advertisement in "The Washington Post" to protest the slow progress of the demobilization effort.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] MacArthur ordered today to immediately lower the service point scores of his troops. The passing score for soldiers has been lowered from 50 points to 48 points, and those who have served for three years and two months can now return to their country. The passing score for officers has been lowered from 70 points to 68 points, or those who have served for three years and eleven months can return to their country. All army personnel in the Pacific under MacArthur's command will be handled in accordance with this order. According to MacArthur's declaration, his intention seems to be to ensure that no ship returning to the United States has an empty cabin when possible. Qualified officers and soldiers will be concentrated first and returned to their country in order according to their service point scores and the convenience of transportation and replenishment.</p>

<p>Vietnamese Revolutionary Leader Expresses Determination to Fight to the End, Says He Rejected Bribery from a Certain Party</p>
<p>[United Press, Vietnam, 12th] The Vietnamese revolutionary leader, President Minh of the "Viet Nam Republic," told reporters today: "A certain party bribed me with 2 million Vietnamese currency, asking me to give up the struggle for Vietnamese independence. I not only rejected it, but also announced that the people under my command are already prepared to fight, hoping that the United Nations will uphold justice and stop the bloodshed. We will devote all our efforts to guerrilla warfare. In the past, we used broadswords and earthen guns to resist Japan, and we will do the same in the future. Freedom cannot be given by others, it must be won by ourselves. The Vi Ning army is poorly equipped, and the air force only has two small planes and no pilots, which is not enough to withstand a single blow, but freedom will eventually come. World public opinion is sympathetic, so we are not isolated and will definitely fight to the end. I am determined to fight the French ruling class, not the French people. The Chinese occupying authorities have not interfered in the revolutionary government." At the same time, a French spokesman said that if Minh's so-called bribery refers to France, it is absolutely false.</p>

<h3>The Government and Communist Party Representatives' Four-Stage Talks: Shao Lizi and Zhou Enlai Report to the Third Political Consultative Conference</h3>
<p>First Report by Shao Lizi</p>
<p>Chairman, distinguished guests: The full text of the meeting minutes has already been published. My report will only address key points, explaining a few points regarding the doubts about the talks from various social sectors: First, people often ask, did both sides in the talks have sincerity? My answer is: Yes, they were sincere. Second, people often ask if the talks were not public, besides the published reports, were there any secrets? Were there any important issues not disclosed? My answer is: No. Even if one or two points were not included in the meeting minutes, there was nothing that could not be made public, and it could still be made known to the public. Third, some people see that the talks lasted so long, yet no real solutions were reached, and ask if the representatives on both sides were not fulfilling their responsibilities, or even intentionally dragging out the time? My answer is: No one dared to be lazy, and no one dared to deliberately delay. Fourth, some people may even ask: After the meeting minutes were published, the problems could not be resolved, is it because both sides intentionally refused to compromise, resulting in a stalemate? My answer to this is: On certain points, there was indeed a refusal to compromise, both on the government's side and the Communist Party's side. This is because: (1) The difficulties were caused by the fundamental differences that have existed for many years, and (2) the positions of the two sides are fundamentally different, and each has points that cannot be conceded, though there were indeed many concessions made. The public mainly asks about these three or four points.</p>
<p>Below, I will provide a comprehensive explanation within this scope: Mr. Zhou Enlai has already explained that since the War of Resistance, the Communist Party has always recognized the Three Principles of the People, recognized the Kuomintang as the leading party, and recognized the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek. This remains the case today, which we greatly admire. As for the government, it has been determined since the first day of the War of Resistance to unite the strength of the entire country, and at the same time recognized the Communist Party's increased role in the War of Resistance. Although unfortunate events gradually occurred later,</p>
<p>President Chiang has consistently decided to resolve the Communist Party issue through political means, and has repeatedly declared this decision to the national citizenry. Once the War of Resistance ended, he sent telegrams several times inviting Mr. Mao Zedong to Chongqing. Mr. Mao had never come out before, but this time he came to Chongqing. These are certainly the most sincere expressions. After Mr. Mao came to Chongqing, President Chiang and Mr. Mao had several talks, which were very frank, and everything that needed to be said was said. Our talks were conducted in this spirit. From Mr. Mao's arrival in Chongqing to the publication of the meeting minutes on Double Ten Day, our talks can be divided into four stages:</p>
<p>First Stage</p>
<p>The initial four days of continuous talks were the first stage. At that time, the Communist side had an idea to first cultivate a good atmosphere for the talks, and the government side agreed, because there were too many unfortunate events in the past. Without a good atmosphere, it would be very difficult to discuss various specific issues. The government's initial intention was to resolve the issues as quickly as possible. Mr. Xue Ting said yesterday that he had advocated resolving the issues within ten days. However, another view was that haste makes waste, so it was also a good idea to first cultivate the atmosphere and then discuss practical issues. During those four days, we fully exchanged opinions.</p>
<p>Second Stage</p>
<p>Starting from September 4th, we discussed practical issues, and we began to find that there were very difficult situations to resolve, namely items nine and ten in the meeting minutes. Item ten, the issue of local governments, was ultimately not resolved. Item nine, the military issue, had a decided solution in the meeting minutes, but there were many difficulties in the process, and it still needs to be genuinely resolved. From September 4th, everyone saw that the issues were not easy to resolve, and believed that cultivating a good atmosphere was still very important, and that we could not rush to solve the issues. From the 4th to the 21st, there were a total of eight meetings. This can be said to be the second stage. Sometimes we talked every day, sometimes we talked every other day. September 10th, 11th, and 12th, we talked every day.</p>
<p>Third Stage</p>
<p>Originally, the communique could have been issued on the 21st, but because the Communist Party insisted on their position on the issue of local governments, no agreement was reached, and as a result, the communique could not be issued. At that time, the situation almost caused the talks to run aground, but we were unwilling to truly run aground, because this was a matter of national safety and even world peace, so negotiations began again on the 27th and continued until October 5th, with a total of four meetings. This can be said to be the third stage.</p>
<p>Fourth Stage</p>
<p>During these four negotiations, the two sides again fully exchanged opinions, but there were still some points on which agreement could not be reached, and Mr. Mao, because the days of delay had been quite long, had a need to return to Yan'an immediately. President Chiang had said earlier that Mr. Mao could return to Yan'an at any time. According to the situation at the time, the communique almost still could not be issued. As I said just now, we are very grateful for Mr. Zhang Wenbai's final efforts in publishing the meeting minutes. The few days before the meeting minutes were announced can be said to be the fourth stage. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Second Report by Zhou Enlai</p>
<p>At the Third Political Consultative Conference, member Zhou Enlai reported on the course of the talks between the government and the CCP representatives as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman, distinguished guests: The history of the KMT-CPC talks is very long, lasting nine years. During these nine years, I participated in almost all of them, except for a very short period. Today, the War of Resistance has been won and the era of peace has begun. I do not want to report here on the situation of the KMT-CPC talks during the past eight years of the War of Resistance. I only want to talk about some of the guiding principles in the KMT-CPC talks during those eight years. Before the start of the War of Resistance, between 1936 and 1937, the CCP representatives and the government representatives at that time had talks. The central issues discussed were the same as today, which were peace and democracy. The difference was that at that time, it was about stopping the civil war and uniting to resist Japan, while eight years later today, what is required is to stop the internal strife and unite to build the country. Before the War of Resistance, the goal of stopping the civil war and uniting to resist Japan was achieved, which led to the launch of the July 7th Incident. Therefore, when I report here, I have the same belief that we will definitely be able to achieve the goal of stopping the internal strife and uniting to build the country.</p>
<p>Over the past nine years, I have participated in negotiations and made the same request twice, and both times it has been achieved to stop the civil war. Although on the one hand, I am filled with emotions, on the other hand, I feel that having achieved the goal twice, first and foremost for the sake of the Chinese people, I personally feel a little comforted. However, no matter what, it is always extremely unfortunate that our country and nation have gone through such twists and turns twice. Based on this, I feel that regarding the report on the negotiation process during the War of Resistance, it is only necessary to mention one point to illustrate. The principle of the initial negotiations was to stop the civil war and unite to resist Japan, so the negotiations after the War of Resistance became protracted were mostly limited to solving local problems, such as the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region issue, and the recognition and organization of anti-Japanese troops behind enemy lines. At the same time, demands for the people's freedoms and rights were put forward. At that time, the government also made some responses, but because the differences of opinion were still far apart, no solutions were reached. In the last period, which was in 1944, the CCP again proposed solving the overall problem, that is, at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Third National Political Consultative Conference, Delegate Lin Zuhan, representing the CCP, proposed the idea of a coalition government. After the Political Consultative Conference, there were several more discussions, but the government felt that this idea would shake the legitimacy of the government, so it was not accepted. The existence of these problems caused the disputes to continue, which also laid the roots for the unfortunate civil war that occurred after the victory of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, a new opportunity came. Mr. Chiang telegraphed Mr. Mao three times to invite him, and Mr. Mao accepted the invitation. Immediately, the new negotiations after the War of Resistance began. The principle of the negotiations during this period was to move from general topics to specific issues. After Mr. Mao came to Chongqing, the government appointed Mr. Wang Xue Ting, Mr. Zhang Yue Jun, Mr. Zhang Wen Bai, and Mr. Shao Li Zi as representatives. The CCP appointed myself and Comrade Wang Ruofei as representatives to begin negotiations. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai Reports to the Political Consultative Conference: Lessons Learned from Experience (Continued and Concluded)</h3>
<p>The second part is about how the ceasefire will proceed. Mr. Zhang Yuejun spoke very specifically, regarding the scope of authority, the organizational structure, and the scope of the agreement. I would like to supplement a few relevant issues. Article 4 of the ceasefire agreement establishes a military mediation executive headquarters, which has four tasks:</p>
<p>First, to cease all conflicts within the national scope. The complete cessation of conflict means that from Hainan Island in the south to Inner Mongolia in the north, from the northeast in the east to Suiyuan in the west, all places where there are conflicts should cease. To deliver this order, not only do we need to exchange telegrams, but we also need to send personnel to notify. For example, Hainan Island has been blockaded for seven or eight years. There are military conflicts between the guerrilla forces led by the CCP and the government forces. In other parts of Guangdong, military conflicts have also occurred between the troops led by the CCP and the government forces. Also, in other places, after the regular troops led by the CCP withdrew, the government troops clashed with the guerrilla forces led by the CCP. Also, there are conflicts when the government troops enter the areas where the CCP is active. All of this should be stopped. In these places, the military mediation executive headquarters should send people to monitor. The executive headquarters should set up many stations, many groups, to go to various places. However, whether it is a station or a group, the three parties should send people to act together and agree unanimously to seek solutions. The plan to stop all conflicts before the 13th can be implemented quickly. The three parties of the Beijing military mediation executive headquarters are scheduled to go to Ping on the 13th of this month. We hope that within this month, stations or groups can be sent to all conflict locations to stop all conflicts.</p>
<p>Transportation and Postal Services Must Be Restored First</p>
<p>Second, to restore all transportation, first of all, it is necessary to restore railway transportation. This is due to the stagnation of military conflicts. Also, there are many that were blockaded during the War of Resistance. Not only is walking difficult, but postal and telegraph services are also often obstructed. Therefore, the three-person meeting should restore all land, sea and air transportation, and the obstacles to postal and telegraph communication should also be removed. This is the true restoration of transportation. True freedom of transportation can be seen in the third paragraph of the ceasefire order.</p>
<p>Third, the third task of the executive headquarters is the issue of accepting surrender. There are still nearly 200,000 enemies who have not completely disarmed. The main areas are in North China, and there are also some in eastern China. In the government-controlled areas, and in the areas surrounded by the troops led by the CCP, the enemy's weapons must be disarmed. This is also something that the executive headquarters must ask about. Fourth, how to send the enemy prisoners who have been disarmed back to their home country, and what transportation lines to take, are also things that the executive headquarters must ask about. These four items are related to the ceasefire and also to the Allied countries, so the military mediation executive headquarters must ask about them. If this is done, not only will all military conflicts stop and transportation be restored, but also the surrender issue, which is one of the main causes of the civil war, will no longer exist.</p>
<p>Regarding matters outside the scope of the executive headquarters' work but also related, such as military movements as mentioned by Mr. Zhang Yuejun just now, it is also necessary to report to the executive headquarters, so that the executive headquarters can discern and avoid excuses and misunderstandings. This point should also be supplemented. The ceasefire order was authorized by the government to Mr. Zhang Yuejun, and the CCP authorized myself to sign it. At the same time, it was announced to the outside world, and also</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang and CCP Chairman Mao Zedong both issued orders. Last night, Mr. Zhang Yuejun told me that Chairman Chiang had already issued an order to notify all troops. I received news from Yan'an this morning that the order had also been issued last night. According to our agreed time, all conflicts should cease.</p>
<p>Reorganize the Army to Permanently Eliminate the Civil War</p>
<p>The third part is about how to eliminate the civil war. This is the main problem to be solved by this political consultative conference. I personally would like to explain one point. Because Mr. Zhang Yuejun just mentioned his hope that after the ceasefire, the three-person military sub-group meeting would be convened quickly to discuss the reorganization issue, the army should be reorganized, the entire Chinese army should be reorganized, and the CCP army should also be reorganized, in order to achieve the goal of nationalizing the army. This has already been decided. As for how to eliminate the civil war, that is not included in the scope of discussion of the three-person military sub-group. I think this is one of the issues to be discussed at the political consultative conference. In this regard, we have the following hopes: (1) To eliminate the civil war, to restore transportation, there is a principle, that is, conflicts of opinion among all parties in the country, conflicts of opinion between parties, all those that are political in nature, should be resolved by political means, and should never be allowed to develop into military conflicts. Domestic issues should be resolved by the government. Chairman Chiang has stated several times that even the problems of the world should be resolved by political means, let alone domestic problems? All domestic problems should be resolved by political means, which is the reason for convening the political consultative conference. However, we have a concept about this issue, that since domestic problems can only be resolved by political means at present, then people with different ideas and different opinions, except for criminals or those who violate general laws and can be dealt with according to law, there is no way to exclude or eliminate them for any other political reason. This principle must be established.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the military inspection group, it should be organized by fair people selected from the National Political Consultative Conference and the Political Consultative Conference. If this can be done, we will surely be told many valuable opinions by both sides and by the whole country. At the same time, it will definitely be of great help in deciding how to eliminate the plan for civil unrest. (3) We feel that those enemies who still carry weapons and massacre the Chinese people after surrendering should be regarded as war criminals and punished. (4) We believe that specific measures should be decided for disbanding the puppet army. This is a principle that both sides agreed to in the meeting minutes. We hope that the government will set up measures as soon as possible. Those puppet troops who participate in the civil war and provoke internal strife should be severely punished.</p>
<p>The Communist Army is Determined to Reorganize</p>
<p>(5) The army reorganization plan is very important to our peace and national construction. In the future, it can be incorporated into the peace and national construction plan for discussion, so the political consultative conference needs to discuss the army reorganization issue. If we can get the agreement of all political parties, and then come up with several plans, under this plan, the troops led by the CCP will definitely reorganize according to the plan. At the same time, the CCP has promised to reorganize into 20 divisions, and we will definitely be able to discuss this in the three-person sub-group meeting to make the national army embark on the path of nationalization. I can represent the CCP delegation, and I can also represent the Chinese Communist Party, to guarantee that this matter can definitely be done. The above five points are our current opinions on eliminating the civil war. As for the fundamental method of eliminating the civil war, it is the issue of political democratization. The scope is very broad, and we want the gentlemen of the conference to discuss it carefully. (Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th)</p>
<h3>Entering from America's Back Door: Sightseeing in New York and Washington</h3>
<p>#### By Zhu Jiarang, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, from New York</p>
<p>The post-war period still felt like wartime. The trains from Canada to New York hadn't yet restored sleeper car services, so everyone had to sit up overnight, eyes wide open. As a result, many people took advantage of the opportunity and lay down, propping up their feet, creating a chaotic and smoky scene, quite similar to the third-class night trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou line. Passport and luggage checks were all done on the train, so there was no more hassle upon arrival, which was not a bad method. Usually, entry procedures into the US were quite troublesome, but this time I entered through America's back door, so health certificates and quarantine certificates weren't even questioned, making it extremely easy.</p>
<p>As day broke, the train sped along within the US. Looking at the vast, flat fields, this was a uniquely blessed, resource-rich, and fertile land. In the past five years, it shouldered the great responsibility of being the arsenal of the democratic countries, and it shed blood and sweat, fighting valiantly in every corner of the world. Now, it had turned the tide and saved the planet. As a Chinese person, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and respect.</p>
<p>At eight in the morning, the train arrived at New York's Grand Central Terminal, and I began to experience American life. The station was larger than London's Victoria Station, with the train platforms all underground, a novel design. On the station walls, there were large American flags, a form of civic education.</p>
<p>High One Hundred and Two Stories: The World's Tallest Skyscraper</p>
<p>This world-renowned city of New York, located at the mouth of the Hudson River in the eastern US, is like our Shanghai, with its own Huangpu River. But in terms of grandeur, Shanghai naturally pales in comparison. Especially the skyscrapers here are unparalleled. We used to look at pictures and sometimes think they were made of toys, but now that I'm here, I know it's not a dream but a reality. Shanghai's International Hotel and its thirteen stories are far behind. The so-called high-rises here are generally over forty stories. The Rockefeller Center, including the RCA Building, is seventy stories and eight hundred and fifty-three feet tall, considered very high, and attracts many tourists to the roof for sightseeing every day. The fast elevators make your ears pop, but it ranks only fourth. The tallest is the Empire State Building, with one hundred and two stories and one thousand two hundred and fifty feet. Next is the Chrysler Building, with seventy-seven stories and one thousand and forty-six feet. The third tallest is the Wall Tower, which has fewer stories than Rockefeller Center, but is taller in height. The Times Square area is just a long triangle, and its height used to be famous, but now it seems too inadequate. The flashing lights of the top news stories around the roof no longer reach very far.</p>
<p>Six Million Phone Calls: Average Daily Total</p>
<p>New York City is actually an island on the Atlantic coast, but now Greater New York has five boroughs, including its surrounding mainland. According to statistics, Greater New York is thirty-six miles long and sixteen and a half miles wide, with a total population of seven million six hundred and seventy thousand. With such a large world-class city, the complexity of its culture and the noise of its traffic can be imagined. Someone made some interesting statistics about New York: according to the Bibles printed by the New York Bible Society, there are eighty-three languages ​​used by the city's residents, so New York City has at least that many languages, truly a place where "people from all directions gather," reaching its peak. According to statistics, New York's water pipes are four thousand five hundred miles long, sewers are three thousand miles long, subway tunnels are five hundred miles long, and there are about one million nine hundred thousand telephones, with no less than six million calls every day, because on average, one hundred and seventy-five people are using the phone every second. The dynamics of people are also amazing: according to the estimate in 1942, two hundred and ninety million people came and went here by train or ship every day, so there are hotels and restaurants everywhere. As for hotels, there are more than five hundred, with one hundred and twenty thousand rooms. The above figures may be only one or two years old, but today it is full everywhere, and finding a hotel is as difficult as climbing to heaven. This problem is still very serious.</p>
<p>Country Folks Entering the City Won't Become Lost Sheep</p>
<p>The core area of ​​New York City is on this rectangular island. The waterfront is full of docks, and eighty-thousand-ton ships can easily sail into the Hudson River and dock. New York's prosperity is actually caused by the harbor, so President Sun Yat-sen's plan to move Shanghai to the Wusongkou had its geographical necessity. Because the terrain is a long island, the layout of New York's streets is more systematic than any other city. Perhaps Americans value numbers. Their city streets, except for a few, are uniformly numbered. The long ones are called Avenues, and the horizontal ones are called Streets. The numbers are clear, and you can tell the location at a glance, so even if country folks enter the city, they won't become lost sheep. However, although the city's streets are block-shaped, there is also a "diagonal road" that runs straight through the heart, piercing north and south, which is the famous and colorful Broadway.</p>
<p>Snow Thick, Wood Leaves All Bare: The Whole City is Full of Light and Heat</p>
<p>Seeing New York after arriving from Europe is simply too happy. People there are short of water and coal, eat less and wear less, and are hungry and stingy, but that will never be passed on from Paris and London. First of all, the neon lights are dazzling, and every place is brightly lit. The fire heats every house so that it is steaming hot. Even though it is winter, the snow is thick, the trees are bare, and it is still warm. This city has both light and heat. The United States contributed greatly to this war, but in this city, it is simply impossible to see any war. High-rise buildings, people from all countries are enjoying themselves, and there are crowds of people on the road. Eating, drinking, and having fun, US dollars are dancing. What can't you do? The materials consumed in this city every day must also be an astronomical figure. Not to mention anything else, let’s talk about newspapers. They are published several times a day, and the paper is always a large stack. The New York Times has as many as thirty-five or six pages. Those who are used to a piece of paper in China and Europe can't hide it in their bags when they get it, and instead find it cumbersome. And with so many newspapers and long articles, everyone is busy, who can read them all one by one? So after a quick glance, they are sent into the trash can. It's a pity that so much effort and hard work are wasted with just a flash in front of people. Paper is not uncommon in the United States. Paper for wiping faces, paper for drinking water, don't know how much is wasted. But sometimes I think, a country with such a large production capacity must have a lot of waste in order to keep the machines running and the workers can have "full employment". Otherwise, if they were to be frugal, capitalism would panic.</p>
<p>Seeing is Believing: The White House Looks Like an Ordinary Residence</p>
<p>I also had the opportunity to go to Washington. Although trains were added during Christmas, departing less than an hour apart, it was still crowded with people. Among them, naturally, there were many soldiers returning home recently. The car passed through Philadelphia and Baltimore and arrived in four hours. The scene here was obviously very different. The streets were wider than in New York, and there were more trees on both sides. Although there were many tall buildings, they were not like New York's "twin peaks piercing the clouds," making the "a line of sky" annoying. The trolleys rolled slowly on the rails, and the pedestrians were much quieter. This is a very ideal and beautiful residential area.</p>
<p>But Washington is ultimately a political headquarters. Its hustle and bustle is not in the business field, but in the buildings of each institution. The State Department and the Treasury Department are giant buildings on the left and right sides of the White House. The famous White House, however, looks like an ordinary middle-class residence. The house is indeed white, but it is short and small, which is unexpected. Moreover, it is adjacent to the commercial area and movie theaters. There is no big sign at the entrance, and no armed guards. A flagpole stands on the lawn, which is considered to indicate the location of their head of state. The government agencies seem to be very large, with the War Department being very big. Its glorious mission has now been successfully completed.</p>
<p>Washington has a Unique Style: Simple, Bright, and Elegant</p>
<p>Washington's scenic area, from the Lincoln Memorial directly to the Washington Monument, is a center, but these buildings are simple and bright, without any formalities. Inside the Lincoln Memorial, there is only a Lincoln statue, and nothing else. The Washington Monument is simply a towering stone shoot, the most memorable is the Capitol and the Library of Congress.</p>
<p>The US Congress, although not as quaint as the British one, is beautifully decorated and is often open to the public for visits, which is its characteristic. The building is roughly rectangular, with a dome hall in the middle, dividing the Senate and House of Representatives into two, each with chambers and offices.</p>
<p>The Library of Congress's collection of books, after the destruction of the Berlin Museum, is probably the world's largest. The original large building was not enough, and now another one has been opened, with many specially equipped individual reading rooms, and external sounds cannot disturb them at all. The library's catalog cabinets are already vast, and the richness of the books is staggering.</p>
<p>Thirty Chinese Books Presented to Marshall to Encourage Him</p>
<p>The library's organization has an Oriental Group China Department, and the collection of thread-bound books is no less than tens of thousands of volumes, managed by Chinese staff. This time, when Marshal Marshall was ordered to come to China, the Oriental Group selected thirty kinds of relevant Chinese reference books to give to Marshal Marshall to take with him. The library's exhibition of the original draft of the US Declaration of Independence and the original draft of the Constitution is very valuable, and all management is new and reasonable.</p>
<p>Washington's position after the war is still becoming more important day by day. The Secretary of State is running around, and Truman's weekly press conferences are no less than a barometer of international affairs. Moreover, American social problems, like those in Britain, are also precarious. The General Motors (G.E.) and General Electric (G.M.) labor strikes are still in a "tug-of-war" state, and the national electrical workers are brewing a general strike in January next year, which is really hurting the government's brains. American public opinion is also mixed. For every thing, it is inevitable to say good or bad. The US military is stationed in our North China, originally to disarm the Japanese, but now if ten newspapers, they are calling for it to withdraw quickly, especially a "Daily Worker" with the same name as the one in London, has too little of a "friendly" tone.

<h3>An Extremely Important Yet Neglected Group: The Nutritional Problems of Poor Students</h3>
<p>#### By Ni Zhangqi</p>
<p>After the war, there were scars everywhere. Today, the central government and allied relief organizations, the provinces, and the city charity organizations, although working hard to help, there is still a shortage of monks and little porridge. Therefore, those who are neglected and have not received relief are probably not just one group. The group referred to in this article is an extremely important group, but since it is important, it is neglected, which seems contradictory.</p>
<p>Who is the most important group being neglected by current relief efforts? I think it is diligent and frugal students. Now, let's talk about its importance first.</p>
<p>Speaking of students as extremely important members, it is not difficult to talk endlessly and redundantly. Let me give a few examples to illustrate:</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen was also one of the students in his youth. After graduation, he first treated patients, and then he saved the weak and chaotic country, leading the sages and creating the Republic of China. Fifty years ago, without Dr. Sun Yat-sen's leadership, or if Dr. Sun had unfortunately passed away too early, the revolution to overthrow the Qing Dynasty by the Tongmenghui Kuomintang would have been difficult to proceed quickly.</p>
<p>By extension, the leaders of the four allied countries in this war and many meritorious personnel who directly and indirectly contributed to the victory, if they had been physically weak when they were in school and had difficulty undertaking difficult work when they were in office, what would have been the impact on the whole world?</p>
<p>Thomas Edison did not spend many years in school. After leaving school, he studied diligently and was able to contribute many inventions such as electric lights and phonographs to the world. If he had been weak due to lack of wheat materials in school, or if he had died while on the path of invention, what would have been the loss to the world?</p>
<p>What would have been the loss to the world if other scientists such as Pasteur, Koch, Ehrlich, Darwin, and Smith had died early due to physical weakness after graduation?</p>
<p>The above is an analogy from historical events, which is enough to show how important the responsibility of students is and how important their health is.</p>
<p>Speaking of students as "a group that has been neglected," the listener may think that it is not consistent with the facts; on the contrary, there are many facts that may prove that the central government and all sectors of society pay attention to and care for students.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the free areas and the occupied areas tried their best to maintain education, establish scholarships, student loans, free places, etc., to help poor students. Last spring, the newspaper reported that a gentleman donated 100 million student loans alone, which shows that there are many enthusiastic and loving students in the society. With the advent of victory, education has been highly valued. In Shanghai alone, there are many national, municipal, or private universities, middle schools, and primary schools. Although private schools have tight funds, they continue their scholarship program. All sectors of society are still actively donating to scholarships. In terms of education, students do not seem to have been forgotten.</p>
<p>In terms of hygiene, students have not been forgotten either. The Health and Epidemic Prevention Department of the Health Bureau has a special department in charge of school health. The Health Bureau has also jointly organized a Health Education Committee with the Education Bureau. Moreover, the municipal hospitals are not concentrated in one area, but are scattered in all parts of the city. Students who are sick can seek medical treatment from nearby municipal hospitals; and the entrance physical examination is also undertaken by nearby municipal hospitals.</p>
<p>Usually, there are many students who claim to be healthy, and others also know that they are really healthy. If you listen to their heart, check their lungs, check their blood, and test their urine, you will not find any evidence of disease. Naturally, they are not within the scope of hospital relief. But if you measure their height and weight, you will know that they are below the normal standard, especially the ratio of weight to height (also known as the nutritional quotient) is surprisingly unqualified. Many of these students are too light in weight, but since they are not patients, doctors do not consider them to be patients; therefore, the research groups of the Health Bureau and municipal hospitals, and research experts, cooperate with each other, and attach special importance to this problem. Students do not seem to have been neglected.</p>
<p>Although it is known that the problem of students being too light in weight is serious, it is known that they are healthy on the outside but dry on the inside, and it is also known that helping them with a few taels of nutritional food every day can achieve twice the result with half the effort in the long run; but until now, the nutritional food for students has not been implemented, which is really regrettable! What I mean by forgetting and being neglected is the nutritional problem of students.</p>
<p>If the problem of student malnutrition is neglected, it can affect other matters that are not neglected, and all efforts will be wasted. For example, students are studying in excellent schools with the help of scholarships, and thanks to the progress of various health undertakings, they have not suffered from infectious diseases during their study period; but their weight is always too light, just like building a house on sandy land, without a solid foundation, it is difficult to support it in the event of a sudden wind and rain. Their own ambitions, and the efforts, love, and hope of all sectors of society for them, will all be in vain with their weak bodies!</p>
<p>Newspapers publish that the government and many charities are devoted to various relief efforts, with a wide scope, including nursing homes, nurseries, orphanages, rehabilitation centers for the disabled, vocational training centers, shelters, soup kitchens, women's training centers, midwifery centers, outpatient clinics, free hospital beds, and others. It is a pity that there is no mention of subsidies for student meals! Is this a beautiful but insufficient occasional forgetfulness? Or is it about to start this important subsidy work?</p>
<p>From the point of view of humanitarianism and sympathy, many relief efforts are important. Now, speaking of the importance of subsidizing students' nutritional food, it is not to put this before other relief efforts, but to ask for a comprehensive plan and not to forget and neglect this equally important issue for a long time. The author has mentioned many times that if students are physically weak and die young, then their parents, teachers, friends, government, society, and various educational works will be in vain, and if those who die young have Edison's inventive ability, the world will also suffer losses. Therefore, the importance of subsidizing nutritional food is next only to subsidizing scholarships. Scholarships have been very successful, but subsidized nutritional food has not yet been implemented. The latter is slightly complicated to implement. In addition to social enthusiasts and experts, if teachers from various schools help with the distribution, it will be able to be pragmatic and orderly. The detailed methods can be formulated by experts.</p>
<p>The students' three meals a day, clothing, housing, and transportation are all undertaken by their parents. Only a few taels of food rich in protein and fat are supplemented every day, and the definite effect can be seen in the long run. Calculating the cost required for each person per month, the cost is small and the effect is great, which is far better than other relief efforts.</p>
<p>Many poor families often cut back on food and clothing to educate their children. It is said that although the family is poor, learning is not interrupted. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, prices were low, and each yuan could buy dozens of eggs or several bottles of milk, and at that time, there was a risk of lack of nutrients in the diet of poor students. What's more, in recent years, prices have soared to hundreds or thousands of times. Many families find it difficult to maintain firewood and rice, or they fill their stomachs with two congee and one meal, or cook corn with rice. They know that the nutrients in the food are not good and insufficient, but they have no good strategy; even tofu and dried tofu are many times more expensive than meat prices before the war. Scholarships and student loans are good deeds to help them through a difficult time, and there are many economic difficulties that are difficult to describe. Without guidance and advice, they know the importance of nutrients, but unfortunately these students and their families are powerless, almost like fish trapped in a dry ditch.</p>
<p>According to newspaper reports, unemployed workers and unemployed child laborers can get dozens of pounds of free flour every month. But it must be known that poor, hardworking, frugal, and thrifty students will serve society and the world in the future, and their importance may not be as important as today's ordinary workers, and the cost of subsidizing a student's nutritional food is far less than the need to relieve an unemployed worker.</p>
<p>Modern countries pay attention to education, and at the same time pay attention to student nutrition. In countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, students who are below the standard weight can drink free milk, and the cost is fully donated by the government and philanthropists; since its implementation, it has been beneficial without any harm. Whether before or after the war, the economies of British and American students are relatively more affluent, but they have long implemented subsidies for students' nutritional food. Our country should also rise up and catch up.</p>
<p>The Shanghai press and gentlemen from all walks of life have cooperated to hold scholarships several times, with remarkable results, and at present, all sectors of society are working together to form a student loan committee and vigorously promote it. I believe that regarding subsidies for students' nutritional food, we should also take advantage of this opportunity to work together with all our strength and earnestly cooperate. If the results are really good after a few months of implementation, the enthusiastic donors will not be limited to the local area and the country. And this extremely important yet neglected army can also get the subsidy of nutritional food.</p>

<h3>Local Finance and Commerce – A Weekly Summary: Securities See the Most Intense Price Surge; Commodities Also Rise More Than Fall</h3>
<p>In the past week, due to the beginning of the Gregorian calendar year, the local financial market in this city saw an oversupply of floating capital. Speculators seized the opportunity to launch assaults on various markets, triggering a significant price surge. Government bonds, Chinese stocks, foreign stocks, yarn, cotton, cloth, artificial silk, raw silk, knitwear, silk fabrics, flour, sugar, and other commodities all reached unprecedented high prices. However, with the issuance of the domestic ceasefire order and the continuous sale of cotton yarn by the China Textile Construction Company, along with the ongoing sale of received supplies such as oil, sugar, meat, and fish, a substantial amount of currency has been absorbed. If the authorities truly have no intention of competing with the people for profit, then this policy of selling domestic goods at high prices can indeed stabilize the people's faith in legal tender and reduce the fervor of high-price speculation.</p>
<p>Finance: Last week, the daily interbank lending rate for 1,000 yuan in the silver and money market remained fixed at 0.3. The unofficial rate varied depending on the institution's status and creditworthiness, ranging from as low as 0.06 to as high as 0.12. Spot gold prices were influenced by higher gold prices in the Northeast, Tianjin, Beijing, and Kunming compared to Shanghai, and the U.S. dollar exchange rate had not yet been announced. The market fluctuated slightly between 820,000 and 870,000, finally settling at 851,000 yuan, an increase of 54,000 yuan from the previous week. The U.S. dollar initially fell due to rumors of import restrictions by the U.S. and that importers were not accepting large sums, but rebounded due to buying by money exchange businesses and manufacturers. The week closed at 1,440 yuan, up 35 yuan from the previous week. Although the U.S. dollar exchange rate has not been officially announced, exporters can freely store and dispose of foreign exchange earned from foreign sales. This is currently the case for exports of raw silk, tea, hairnets, straw hats, and pig bristles. Old Hong Kong dollars were sold by Hong Kong and Guangdong traders at low prices. Money exchange businesses and securities firms bought new issues, and there were rumors of a 2:1 ratio between new and old currency. The peak reached 90 yuan, resulting in an increase of 15 or 16 yuan from the previous week.</p>
<p>Securities: Government bonds surged due to the ceasefire order and the prospect of peaceful unification, along with rumors of consolidation and redemption of public bonds. Banks and speculators aggressively bought in. Category C bonds reached a peak of 1,350 yuan. Securities firms and established bulls sold Category C bonds and bought Category D bonds as a hedge, causing Category D bonds to also break through the 1,000 yuan mark. As a result, prices surged by 415 yuan (Category C) to 535 yuan (Category D) compared to the previous week. Chinese stocks rose due to talks by President Song on revitalizing industry and commerce and news of the resumption of trading at the Shanghai Stock Exchange under the leadership of Du Yuesheng. Large speculators, such as Zhu and Wang, and Cantonese gold merchants bought in large quantities, particularly focusing on the popular Wing On Textile Factory stock, which closed at a new high of 1,380 yuan, a sharp increase of 400 yuan from the previous week. Other stocks, both large and small, also reached new highs. The old cultural stock, Commercial Press, rose to 51,000 yuan. Foreign stocks saw a strong surge due to rumors that Shanghai would close as a free port and that British shipping companies had signed river transport agreements. Foreigners, money exchange businesses, and yarn traders bought in large quantities. The leading stock in the sector, Shanghai Dock and Engineering Company (Hall &amp; Holtz), was particularly sought after, once breaking through the 10,000 yuan mark, a sharp increase of 2,500 yuan from the previous week. Other real estate and industrial stocks also saw new highs.</p>
<p>Regarding goods and commodities, rice from Wuhu and the interior arrived in large quantities, and prices were stimulated by flour. In addition, traders from Tianjin, Qingdao, and other regions purchased thin-husked rice, pushing prices up by 1,000 to 1,500 yuan compared to the previous week. Flour was purchased by traders from Fujian, Hankou, Shantou, and Southeast Asia. No. 1 Cannon brand flour reached 4,000 yuan per bag, an increase of 400 to 500 yuan from the previous week. Among miscellaneous grains, soybeans saw strong demand from oil factories, rising by 300 to 400 yuan per shipment. Raw peanuts saw brisk sales due to the upcoming Lunar New Year, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per load. Large dried raw peanuts specifically for export reached 26,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were frequently purchased by Taiwan and Shantou traders, rising by 300 to 400 yuan per piece. Cotton cakes, used for fuel, sold for 2,500 yuan per 50-jin piece. Cooking oil was purchased by Ningbo traders and local users, rising by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per load. Flat-price vegetable oil was sold at 125 yuan per jin, but soybean oil in the market still rose to 270 yuan. Sugar was in demand for the winter and New Year seasons, with traders from Bengbu, Ningbo, Wuhu, and the North purchasing granulated and powdered sugar. Factories could not meet demand. Although flat-price medium sugar was offered at 360 yuan, it still rose by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per load compared to the previous week. Cotton textiles initially surged due to textile factories seeking supplies. 42-count Blue Phoenix soared to 1.5 million yuan, and 20-count Double Horse reached 900,000 yuan. However, the China Textile Construction Company sold 200 to 300 bales of yarn daily, and customs prohibited shipments from Hong Kong, resulting in a decrease of 90,000 to 140,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Cotton cloth saw brisk sales locally, with dyeing factories seeking white plain cloth and traders from Sichuan, Bengbu, and other regions purchasing blue cloth, pushing prices up by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per bolt. Cotton prices rose as the China Textile Construction Company and Rongfeng Textile Factory bought in large quantities. Tongzhou American cotton reached 95,000 yuan per load. However, the yarn market slumped and American cotton imports softened slightly. Other items: tea had sales channels to foreign firms and Northern traders; soap, candles, and firecrackers were purchased by Hankou traders; cigarette prices were initially strong but then weakened due to continuous allocations and the restoration of trading by cigarette exchange businesses.</p>
<h3>Deformed Steel Bars Active; New Rebar Market Improves</h3>
<p>Deformed steel bars were originally a popular item among construction hardware. Since the victory, holders of the goods believed that real sales would be strong and they could wait for a better price. Who would have known that construction work would proceed so slowly, so sales of this product were delayed for a long time. It wasn’t until recently that trading started to become busy. This is due to the purchasing of construction gangs, but ultimately the inventory is richer. Therefore, prices have not yet improved as much as expected. At present, each ton is being sold for 220,000 to 230,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Previously, two-part new rebar goods from this factory once rose as high as more than 500,000 yuan per ton due to a shortage of goods. Afterwards, manufacturers continued to produce products, but real sales were quite dull, so the price fell back very sharply. In recent days, a turning point has gradually appeared, with each ton being offered at 250,000 to 260,000 yuan. However, compared with the highest peak, it is still less than half.</p>
<h3>Dyeing and Weaving Industry Revises New Prices</h3>
<p>The Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association's dyeing group convened a group meeting to discuss the dye price issue. The price that had been resolved before was actually because all the dyes depended on the factory numbers in this city, and there was no sufficient source of fuel. The manufacturer's taxes were increasing day by day, and it was difficult to maintain the capital. Therefore, a new price list was drawn up, which will be announced and implemented today.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Export Volume – Market Price Weakens</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 13th] Yesterday, the cotton market opened up 1 pound, then fell 5 pounds. The market fluctuated. Afterwards, the market was quite active. Due to unfavorable news of new cotton delivery and strikes, general market prices fell slightly. There were higher hopes of short selling. The long positions are in a wait-and-see state. In addition, due to the weekend, there were few transactions. Traders are paying close attention to continuing to oppose the proposed price limit. The old cotton was slightly frustrated. The new cotton’s position was stable and it remained high at 14 pounds.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 13th] The export volume of U.S. cotton could reach 3,500,000 to 4,000,000 bales by the end of July of this year. Last year's export volume was 2,000,000 bales.</p>

<h3>China Textile Construction Company to Take Over Enemy Property Yarn Factory Today; Raw Materials Will be Provided by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration</h3>
<p>The China Textile Construction Company, under the leadership of General Manager Shu Yunzhang, has been negotiating with the special commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for days and is preparing to take over various yarn factories originally operated by the enemy. A consensus has been reached, and it has been decided to start this morning. Those prepared for takeover include the 20 yarn factories belonging to Neiwai, Gongda, and others. The company has assigned 20 receivers to take over and manage the factories today. As for the management issues of each factory, it is said that the company will make the most of talents and hire experienced experts. Among the personnel who came to Shanghai from Chongqing, there are more than 100 experienced technicians. Unless necessary, the existing Japanese technicians retained in each factory will be eliminated. Currently, the operating rate of each factory is 250,000 spindles, accounting for approximately 32% of the total spindles (the total number of spindles in each factory is 820,000). There are at least three reasons for the shutdowns: 1. Insufficient motive power. 2. Raw materials. 3. Lack of skilled workers. However, the raw material issue should no longer be a problem in the future, as a contract has been signed with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to supply 250,000 bales of American cotton.</p>
<h3>Revised Industrial and Commercial Regulations; Chongqing Industrial and Commercial Groups Request; Research of the Draft is Required</h3>
<p>Chongqing News: The Chongqing Factory Federation recently held a dinner party. Chairman Hu Yanwen reported that he had recently learned that the relevant authorities were secretly discussing the revision of tax regulations and strictly prohibited participants in commerce from leaking the news. The industrial sector believes that this is related to its own interests and should request to participate in this meeting. It was passed that the joint factory group should request the government to submit the draft amendments to donation taxes and industrial and commercial regulations to the industrial and commercial groups for research in advance. Some factories that continue to operate feel that it is difficult to maintain, and they intend to request to suspend the payment of interest on loans from national banks.</p>

<h3>Sino-American-British Cultural Exchanges; Six British and American Universities Study Issues Related to China; National Peiping Library Collects Essays for the U.S. State Department</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Chongqing News] A number of universities in Washington State, USA, have decided to exchange 25 university students with us in order to promote Sino-American cultural relations. Our Ministry of Education is about to start preparations. The UK and Australia also have five scholarships to welcome Chinese students to study abroad. In order to promote cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries, the Department of Education will hold foreign culture lectures at Peking University, Central University, and Tsinghua University, and invite famous European and American professors and experts to come to China to give lectures on special topics.</p>
<p>Establishment of Chinese Academic Scholarships</p>
<p>Our country has also established Chinese academic scholarships in six universities including Harvard, Columbia, and Chicago in the United States, and Oxford, Cambridge, and London in the United Kingdom. Each school stipulates five to six scholarships to study issues related to China, including cultural education and other subjects. All research expenses are paid by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>[This City News] In order to promote Sino-American culture, the National Peiping Library was previously entrusted by the U.S. State Department to collect Chinese scientific papers and literary works and translate them into English for publication in the United States. According to the U.S. State Department, as of June of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), the library has forwarded a total of 187 scientific papers to the United States, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, meteorology, engineering, archeology, social sciences, and economics, and most of them have been published in authoritative magazines in the United States.</p>
<p>Solicitation of Chinese Literary Works</p>
<p>Chinese literary works that have been translated into English and sent to the United States by the library include short stories by Mao Dun and others, and scripts by Guo Moruo, Cao Yu, Zhang Junxiang, Lao She, and others. The library is now collecting works from writers in Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin), and other places, which will end at the end of April of this year. Those who pass the review will be paid a fee of 2,500 yuan per thousand words. The remuneration for publication in the United States will still belong to the author. For detailed information, please contact the library in Chongqing or the library's office at 17 Binqing Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Hubei Province Plans to Establish Specialized Colleges in Stages</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Hankou News] The Hubei Provincial Department of Education will establish specialized schools above the college level in stages based on the actual needs of various regions. It is now decided to establish two colleges of agriculture and medicine in Wuchang, a college of commerce in Hankou, and specialized agricultural colleges in Puqi, Shashi, and Huanggang. Specialized industrial colleges will be established in Hanyang, Daye, and Yichang. As for the liberal arts and law departments, the Ministry of Education will decide whether or not they are needed. All of the above-mentioned colleges are newly established, except for the colleges of agriculture and medicine. It is planned to establish the Yichang Industrial College and the Huanggang Agricultural College in 1947. The Puqi Agricultural College will be established in 1948. If this plan can be gradually completed, it will not only help the construction of the province, but also make a great contribution to the entire country.</p>

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Since Bureau Commissioner Yang Bingfan became the principal of the Shanghai South Municipal Agricultural Altar Elementary School, he has been determined to improve school affairs. Yesterday, the school held a parents' meeting, which was attended by more than 500 student parents and guests. Director Zhu of the National Education Office of the Education Bureau gave a speech of encouragement.</p>
<p>The pre-war site of the Municipal Xicheng Elementary School was on Penglai Road in the South City. The school building was spacious and occupied a large area. During the war, it was occupied by the enemy and puppets, and it was forced to move to its current site on Sappoesai Road. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the school held an alumni association meeting. Principal Chai Zifei reported on the eight years of history and the steps for preparing for the restoration of the school. A number of important cases were immediately resolved, including sending a letter to the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police to move out of the original school site on Lai Road, and raising funds to assist the alma mater in restoring the school.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that there is a great shortage of nationally designated textbooks in the recovered areas. It has specially invited representatives from Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, and other companies in Nanjing to discuss solutions. Representatives from each company will go to Beijing to attend the meeting within days. It is said that they will present the actual situation here and request the Ministry of Education to forward it for appropriate handling.</p>
<p>Private primary and secondary school principals in this city will hold a meeting at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge at 2:00 p.m. today to discuss important issues such as tuition fees, salaries, and loans. A reception for the press will be held at 4:00 p.m. on the ninth floor. No notices will be sent. Principals from each school can attend on time.</p>
<p>Daxia University Shanghai School has now decided to move the three colleges of liberal arts, sciences, and education back to the original site on Zhongshan Road in this city for classes in the next semester, and will also accept boarders. The colleges of law and commerce will remain at the current site on Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>Primary school teachers in this city are living in poverty. It has been decided to launch a charity performance to raise a relief fund for teachers. A preparatory committee has been established and is actively planning and promoting it. It is expected to be implemented within the next week.</p>
<p>More than 100 students from Nanjing Provisional Second Middle School went to the Ministry of Education a few days ago to request improvements in their meals. The school principal, Shen Zumao, feared trouble and rushed to persuade them. Deputy Minister Hang personally met with them and agreed to increase the students' food expenses by 500 yuan per month, for a total of 2,500 yuan. Principal Shen then led all the students back to school.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Radio Station Federation, in order to enlighten the public and popularize electrical education, will hold lectures by celebrities, scheduled three times a week, broadcast in rotation by each radio station. The first speaker is Gu, Director of the Education Bureau, which will be broadcast by the National Radio Station starting at 6:00 p.m. today. At that time, all entertainment programs on all radio stations in the city will be suspended and broadcast simultaneously in order to spread the message widely.</p>
<p>Since coming to Shanghai, Zhengzhong Bookstore has been actively promoting its business. In addition to publishing six new books every week, it also prints the latest standard textbooks for schools at all levels in large quantities. In order to facilitate the use of books by the education community in the next semester, it has also printed a detailed list of textbooks, which is widely distributed for selection.</p>
<p>The Art Education Research Association is organized by music educators and labor-art teachers from elementary and secondary schools in this city. It was approved and registered by the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Education in the 28th year of the Republic (1939). Later, due to the deteriorating environment, the association's affairs were forced to stop. A few days ago, the executive committee members Jiang Danshu, Zai Yachen, Xu Xiyi, and Song Shouchang held a meeting to discuss a plan to restore the association. It is said that the meeting place will be temporarily located at Xiaoguang Middle School on Linsen Middle Road. The communication offices are located at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road and Singapore Elementary School on Singapore Road. Any labor-art teachers from elementary and secondary schools in this city who wish to join the association can contact the above addresses to obtain a charter.</p>
<p>Chongqing News: On December 23 last year, the Shantang in Hao Rice Market Street suffered a fire, which affected the nearby China University. The Dezi Hall girls' dormitory was completely destroyed. The school held a school affairs meeting to discuss the aftermath and decided to allocate 300,000 yuan from the school to provide emergency loans. Based on the reported damage, students were given loans ranging from a maximum of 10,000 yuan to a minimum of 2,000 yuan. The chairman of the school board, He Chengjun, and Xu Yuanquan, inspected the disaster situation and donated 500,000 yuan as relief funds. The school closed on the 5th of this month and will move back to Wuchang in mid-April.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Lease Period Production League; Qingbai Lives Up to Expectations; Wins a Big Victory Over the Soviet Union Seven to One; Jewish and British Navies Each Draw</h3>
<p>There were two matches in the first division of the football league yesterday. At 10:00 a.m., there was a match between the Jewish and British Navies. The two sides were evenly matched, with each drawing two goals. At 2:30 p.m., the Chinese elite Qingbai team played against the Soviet Union. The weather was fine and warm, so there were many spectators. As a result of the match, Qingbai was able to cheer up and defeated the Soviet Union by seven to one.</p>
<p>The British and Jewish Teams Fought Fiercely Without a Winner</p>
<p>After defeating Qingbai last week, the Jewish team had Bo Shang general Fu En join the team yesterday, with great ambition. However, the British Navy also dispatched its elite troops to compete on an equal footing. In the first half, Jewish player Donas broke the Jewish goal first. Soon after, British Navy player Panki returned the favor, making it one goal each in the first half. In the second half, British Navy player Davidson forcefully scored. The Jews stepped up their efforts. In the end, Fu En scored, making it a tie again.</p>
<p>Qingbai Cheered Up</p>
<p>Defeated the Soviet Union Greatly</p>
<p>In the afternoon, in the game between Qingbai and the Soviet Union, the former had Qin Bida, Li Yichen, Fei Chunhua, and Gao Baozheng join the team yesterday, which greatly boosted the morale of the army. After taking the field, Qingbai still had an image of unfamiliar cooperation. It was not until 25 minutes later that Fei Chunhua tried to shoot. Espu received the ball and lost it again. Li Yichen rushed over and shoveled it in, making the first record. In less than ten minutes, Xiao Fei hooked in. Li Yichen headed it in again, making it two to zero in the first half. In the second half, Qingbai showed even more vigor. The Soviet Union became more and more chaotic as the war progressed, allowing Qingbai to do whatever they wanted. In ten minutes, Wu Qixiang was injured. Qin Bida served as a defender and Huang Shijie served as a goalkeeper. Not long after, Li Shoyou broke the enemy's goal, and Li Yichen added to the glory, leading by four to zero. Soon after, Soviet Tie Funi hit someone and was sentenced to a penalty kick. Lazy Niu sent the ball in, making it five to zero. Qingbai did not tire of scoring. Li Shoyou and Li Yichen each scored another goal, making it seven to zero. Finally, Soviet Mai Qi shot and hit the goal, resulting in a score of seven to one.</p>

<h3>Hopes for the Shanghai Textile Industry</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The world is in a new era, revolving with the new times! Every second, every minute, it is constantly changing into new forms! "Elimination" for those who retreat! "Survival" for those who advance! This is the "Law of Natural Selection!" No one can escape this law. The writer has been involved in the textile industry for over seventeen years, and has devoted himself to it. On this New Year, I humbly wish to contribute my humble thoughts.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that in the past, the Shanghai textile industry seemed like a heap of loose sand, lacking cohesion and unity. Before the War of Resistance against Japan, the Japanese yarn and cloth factories had an absolute advantage in terms of technology, production and sales, management, and economy! On the one hand, they used unequal treaties as a talisman, and on the other hand, they had government financial support as their backing! With so many spindles and such advanced technology, their yarn and cloth were popular in every poor rural area! Products such as Blue Phoenix yarn and Dragon Head fine cloth were almost household names. Everyone bought a roll, and enemy merchants absorbed the economic blood of every one of our compatriots, leaving no loophole. Some people said, "Don't we also have our own yarn and cloth factories, not too many, not too few?" Sadly, restricted by foreign unequal treaties and lacking government support, they were plagued by internal injuries, backward technology, and poor management. The loose sand could not be united, so they lay down on the side of the river and let others sleep soundly, forming a situation where the guests were more powerful than the host, and there was no cure. When the War of Resistance broke out, Shanghai, a major industrial and commercial city known as the "New York of the East," finally fell into enemy hands. At this time, it was a touchstone for distinguishing loyalty and treachery in the national industry (this is not limited to the national industry). Some factories preferred to die rather than surrender, while others surrendered and cooperated with the enemy, spinning yarn, weaving cloth, or making military uniforms, and willingly became lackeys of the enemy. This is a disgrace in the history of China's national light industry, a permanent stain that cannot be washed away by our light industry. However, I think the traitors who truly surrendered to the enemy were probably few. Most industrialists with the belief of "nation above all" and "ethnicity above all" and with a conscience, either were forced by irresistible threats, or walked on a dead end in order to desperately maintain the livelihood of their employees. However, the distinction between black and white after the dawn cannot be concealed. Loyalty is loyalty, treachery is treachery, clearly distinguished. Looking back at the various oppressions and aggressions of enemy merchants in the past, and our own頹廢 and uncompetitive behavior, we should learn from the pain. As the saying goes, "All the past things are as if they died yesterday! All the present things are as if they will be born tomorrow!" From now on, we should inspire rational "self-reflection," and from reflection, generate new and bright hopes! Devote ourselves to the reconstruction of light industry! The enemy has already surrendered! The restrictions of unequal treaties have also been lifted! From now on, our beautiful land is our own territory! We should invest in the exploration and mining of the rich coal mines, which are the lifeline of light industry, and how should we spread excellent cotton seeds and plan to increase the large amount of cotton production on the vast fields of cotton that are necessary raw materials for our spinning and weaving, and how to set up factories to manufacture textile machinery, how to install generators, create our own power, how to immerse ourselves in research on textile technology to enhance the yarn's tensile strength, high quality, and increase productivity, how to manage labor education, labor insurance, labor recreation, and labor welfare to enhance the feelings and strong unity between labor and capital! Starting from the current 2 million spindles in Shanghai's textile industry, which is supported by both the government and the people, gradually expand to 20 million spindles, 200 million spindles, and even 2 billion spindles! This is not an exaggerated hope! "It depends on human effort," and it is not difficult to "achieve one's ambition"! Even with 2 billion spindles, spreading to all parts of China, which has more than 30 provinces, and estimating the minimum population at 500 million people, it is only 4 spindles per person. Considering the huge amount of yarn and cloth consumption needed for clothing in China and the expected active yarn and cloth export trade in the future! The number of 2 billion spindles is still insignificant! How to achieve that goal? This is the responsibility of the entire Shanghai textile industry, which has a long history, outstanding position, and driving force!</p>
<h3>Amidst the National Recovery, All Aspects of Education in the Capital</h3>
<p>During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the losses in education in the capital were extremely large, and it will take time to reorganize and improve them in the future. Regarding the questions you have asked, I will briefly describe the recent situation of education in various aspects:</p>
<p>Ministry of Education</p>
<p>For the recovery work, the Ministry of Education has successively sent many staff members to Nanjing to work. The ministry's address is still on Chengxian Street. In order to handle matters quickly and efficiently, the ministry has decided that all documents belonging to the education bureaus of Nanjing and Shanghai, as well as the five provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi, will be handled by the person in charge of the Ministry of Education in Nanjing on behalf of the ministry. Unless it is particularly important and must be decided by Minister Zhu, they will consult Chongqing and then proceed. In addition, official documents from the education bureaus of other provinces and cities will be sent directly to Chongqing for processing. Minister Zhu Jiahua and Vice Minister Zhu Jingnong are currently in Chongqing. Vice Minister Hang Liwu is in Nanjing, acting on behalf of the minister. Inspector Peng Baichuan was the first to arrive in Nanjing. Currently, the persons in charge of various departments are: Director Huang Rujin of the Social Affairs Department, who also serves as secretary; Section Chief Zhong Lingxiu; Assistant Xu Weizhu of the General Affairs Department; Section Chief Ma Jiyuan of the Higher Education Department; Section Chief Wang Weixin of the Secondary Education Department; Section Chief Xue Tianhan of the National Education Department; and Section Chief Zeng Shudong of the Tibetan Affairs Department. As for the administrative heads of education in Nanjing and Shanghai and the five provinces, the Ministry of Education has decided that Cheng Shizheng will remain as the Director of the Jiangxi Education Department, Xu Shaodi will be reinstated as the Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, Chen Shizhen, former counselor of the Ministry of Education and counselor of the Executive Yuan, will be transferred to serve as the Director of the Jiangsu Education Department, Wang Shaonan is currently the Director of the Anhui Education Department, and the Fujian Education Department has been changed twice since Zheng Zhenwen was promoted to a member of the Central Party and Government Affairs Committee. Gu Yuxiu, former Vice Minister of Education, will take over as the Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, and Chen Jianru will be reinstated as the Director of the Nanjing Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Universities</p>
<p>The original site of National Central University is still occupied by military hospitals, epidemic prevention troops, and vaccine and serum guidance centers, and has not yet been completely vacated. Only a part of it has been received by the school's receiving committee, including the auditorium and the gymnasium. The medical school, teaching rooms, and affiliated middle school will be received soon. It is expected that the school can be relocated and classes can resume in the summer of 1946. However, it is said that after the school moved to Chongqing, it has more than 4,000 students, which is four times more than the 1,000 students before the war. The original school buildings are already insufficient. In addition, the President of Jinling University, Chen Yuguang, will reportedly fly to Nanjing for a week of inspection and then return to Chongqing. The reopening of the school will also be after the summer. The temporary university preparatory class sponsored by the Ministry of Education will use the buildings received by National Central University for office, classes, and accommodation. Peng Baichuan, a senior inspector of the Ministry of Education, will also be in charge of it. More than a dozen faculty members have been hired (including Chen Jieda, Jin Shuqiao, Ye Shaonong, Xue Wujing, Wu Zhengwei, etc.). There are 900 students, divided into arts and sciences groups (arts includes literature, law, commerce, education; science includes science, agriculture, engineering, medicine). It is at the level of a university preparatory course, with a study period of one year. Those who complete the course and pass can enter the first year of a regular university. The class is expected to start within the first ten days of this month. In addition, the temporary university supplementary class sponsored by the Ministry of Education will temporarily use the old Jinling University buildings for office, classes, and accommodation, and Wang Shulin will be in charge of it. There are dozens of faculty members and more than 2,000 students. According to the examination level, they are divided into grades one, two, three, and four, with all subjects in arts and sciences. However, due to the lack of equipment and talents from the mainland, the medical students will be sent to the Southeast Medical College in Shanghai for enrollment. The third and fourth grade engineering students will be sent to Shanghai Jiaotong University for enrollment. The class has been open for three weeks, with a study period of one year. All students in grades one, two, and three who complete the supplementary period and pass can be sent to regular universities according to their grades to move up one grade. All students in the fourth grade who can complete the course and pass can be considered graduates. The above-mentioned temporary university preparatory and supplementary classes are only for one year of study and are not intended to be a temporary university. Those who pass the examination will be assigned to the supplementary class for one year, while the preparatory class will require one more year of study.</p>
<p>Middle Schools</p>
<p>The three national temporary middle schools sponsored by the Ministry of Education are located in Longpanli (Principal Yu Caicheng), Sanmaogong (Principal Shen Zumo), and Zhuqiao. Each school has more than 1,000 students in each grade of senior and junior high school. In addition, the middle schools sponsored by the Social Affairs Bureau of the Nanjing Municipal Government include Municipal No. 1 Middle School, No. 2 Middle School, No. 3 Middle School (formerly Zhengshi Middle School), Girls' Middle School, Vocational Middle School, and Simple Normal School, totaling six schools. Private middle schools include Anhui, Zhongying, Zhongnan, Jinghua, Yecheng, Dongfang, and Chengmei. Anhui moved to Tunxi during the war. The principal is Yao Wencai. Because the original school buildings in Nanjing were damaged, the number of classes currently offered is not large. They still travel between Nanjing and Anhui, taking care of both sides, and are gradually restoring the whole school. Zhongying has never been interrupted and is currently under the administration of Yu Caicheng. Zhongnan, Principal Qiao Yifan, came to Nanjing and then went to Chongqing. The school suffered a lot of damage, and it is not easy to restore it at the moment. Jinghua, Principal Fu Kuanglin, is currently a teacher and is also very hesitant to reopen the school. Yecheng and Dongfang have both reopened. Chengmei has already started classes. Church middle schools include Huiwen Girls' Middle School, Zhonghua Girls' Middle School, Mingde, Yuqun, Jinling Middle School, and the affiliated middle school of Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, all of which have resumed classes. The Catholic Church also established the Lijizi Middle School in Beiting Lane.</p>
<p>Municipal Bureau</p>
<p>Because the houses of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau have not been fully recovered, it is temporarily located on Shanxi Road with the Municipal Government, which is too far from the original location of Gongyuan, making contact inconvenient. Under Director Chen Jianru, the general affairs are in charge of Section Chief Fang, school education is in charge of Section Chief Yue, and social education is in charge of Director Ji Deliang. There are three municipal middle schools for boys, one for girls, and one each for simple teachers and vocational schools. The distribution of elementary schools in the city, Xiaguan, and outside the city is currently about 60 schools. The schools that were originally run by the church and taken over by the city include Fuminfang, Guyilang, Cibeishe, Gulou, and other elementary schools. Before the war, the school buildings of Cui Baxiang, Malu Street, Huaiqing Bridge, Youfu West Street, Xiangpu Camp, Central Road, Cangding, Gaojing, Hanximen, and Nanchang Road Elementary Schools were completely destroyed and not established, so the number of schools was reduced. Social education includes the First and Second Mass Education Centers, a library, and the First and Second Central Mass Schools. The historical museum and sports field before the war were completely destroyed, and only the swimming pool at Jiulong Bridge has been recently received and opened. The selection of personnel for the positions of principals and directors of various schools and museums has been gradually adjusted, and new appointments or additional appointments have been made. After careful selection and examination of teachers, qualified teachers are employed in all schools. It is hoped that the improvement of treatment and the stability of teachers' lives will enhance the effectiveness of education. (Ann)</p>

<h3>Army Headquarters and Garrison Headquarters Will Soon Jointly Try Jiang Gongmei for Seven Major Crimes Involving Li Ze</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Former Shanghai Military Police Captain Jiang Gongmei was accused of arbitrarily arresting people, illegally detaining vehicles, stealing materials, and extorting money while in office. After receiving repeated complaints from the people to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, an investigation confirmed the evidence. On October 12 of last year, an order was issued to disarm and disband the entire team and arrest Jiang Gongmei. While the case was being investigated, Director Chi Ping of the Chongqing Military Police Headquarters came to Shanghai to take him back for handling. Later, due to the seriousness of the case, an order was issued by the Chairman to have the Songhu Garrison Headquarters handle the case according to law.</p>
<p>Escorted to Shanghai for Joint Trial</p>
<p>The Military Police Headquarters followed the order and sent Major Zeng Jianren, along with the case files, to Shanghai by plane a few days ago. They were handed over to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters for trial. After Director Zeng Zhaoyi quickly sorted out the case files, they were ready for trial. In order to show his seriousness, Commander Qian also telegraphed the Army Headquarters to send personnel to Shanghai for a joint trial. Once they arrive, the trial can begin. The following is a brief record of Jiang Gongmei's crimes:</p>
<p>Numerous Crimes Involving a Wide Range of People</p>
<p>Jiang Gongmei's crimes include three cases of soldiers harming the people, nine cases of arbitrarily releasing criminals, five cases of torture, one case of embezzling public property, two cases of stealing materials, and other acts of corruption, totaling seven major crimes. In addition, he is also involved in the current sensational case of Li Ze, the general manager of the New-New Company, who is suspected of collaborating with the enemy. In September, Li Ze allegedly bribed Jiang with 200 million yuan in counterfeit currency and a car.</p>
<p>Hidden Materials Recovered</p>
<p>As for the materials he secretly hid while in office, they are now awaiting reports from all parties. Part of them have been seized by the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, including 107 large and small pieces of cotton cloth (approximately 3,000 bolts), another 432 bolts, 68 boxes of soap, 134 large and small rubber tires, 11 boxes of inner tubes, 113 pieces of cotton, 154 bales of kapok, 26 boxes of Western medicine, 133 bags of sugar, 38 boxes of screw plates, and other dyes, raw silk, matches, candles, sulfur, etc., which are considerable in quantity.</p>
<p>Soldiers Harming the People and Arbitrarily Releasing Criminals</p>
<p>The cases of soldiers harming the people include the robbery of 62 boxes of cigarettes from Yeguang Weaving Factory, extortion of gold ornaments from porters at the North Station, and robbery of cloth from Wang Xiaoquan. There are a total of nine cases of arbitrarily releasing criminals (Editor's note: The Garrison Headquarters is planning to re-arrest these criminals and bring them to justice. The headquarters has instructed us not to publish them temporarily, so we will omit them.)</p>
<p>Torture and Embezzlement of Public Property</p>
<p>The cases of torture include carpenter Shen Yunguo, An Guojiong, a staff member of the Korean Progressive Newspaper's business department, and Qu Zhonghua, a worker at the British-American Company. The embezzlement of public property includes secretly hiding three cars from the number of cars received by the team from the former enemy military police team in Shanghai South and storing them at the International Automobile Company and Liu Zhiming's place. The stealing of materials includes 27 boxes of Western medicine sealed at Xinzao Elementary School and other important materials and 27 barrels of gasoline from Fuda Coal Company. It was also found that the team never registered the names of the detainees, and when releasing criminals, they would write "Released on discussion" without stating the reasons. Therefore, it is believed that after the trial, the crimes committed will be more than this number.</p>
<h3>Indictment of Xiang Kangyuan; High Court Issues Arrest Warrant</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Following Li Ze, Xiang Kangyuan, the manager of Kangyuan Canning Factory, was also reported by the factory's employees, who pointed out that Xiang had held the puppet position of city advisory committee member. The High Procuratorate's Office had ordered Xiang Kangyuan to be summoned for interrogation on the 10th, but Xiang himself did not appear. Only his wife submitted a statement, stating that her husband was not in Shanghai and requesting a postponement of the interrogation. However, the High Procuratorate's Office believed that the reason why Xiang was not in Shanghai was unfounded and was obviously intended to evade. Therefore, it issued an arrest warrant a few days ago, ordering the police to arrest him quickly for investigation.</p>
<h3>US Secretary of the Army Patterson Arrives in Shanghai Today; US Military Headquarters Prepares to Welcome Him</h3>
<p>US Secretary of the Army Patterson is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. The US Military Headquarters is preparing to welcome him and has borrowed General Pink's office on the 16th floor of the Construction Building as a temporary meeting room.</p>
<p>[This newspaper report] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 13th stated that US Secretary of the Army Patterson arrived in Korea today and will fly to Shanghai tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Students Denounce French Consul General</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the students of Shanghai issued a declaration on the movement to safeguard sovereignty in response to the case of the French warship smuggling war criminals, stating: The French Consul General, disregarding everything, secretly transported Karkopinno from the French warship Beertin to Saigon for trial. Afterwards, he claimed that this was a local event in an attempt to reduce his own guilt. Obviously, the French Consul General's office had no sincerity in accepting the protests of the municipal government and the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and did not want to take appropriate measures to remedy the incident. We painfully recognized their true colors. We want to settle accounts. We demand that the French government apologize to our country and guarantee that the same incident will never happen again.</p>
<h3>Enemy Fugitive Arrested in a Spring Factory</h3>
<p>Wang Yingxiang, the captain of the Second Brigade of the Shanghai North District Security Corps, received a tip-off on the 11th that an enemy military fugitive from the Wusong concentration camp was hiding in a spring iron factory at No. 304 Baiyu Lane, Mabai Road, Xiaoshadu Road. Captain Wang immediately ordered Captain Zhao of the Sixth Company to lead a number of corps members and police officers from the Putuo Road Police Station to the address. They arrested an enemy fugitive named Enomoto Yoshishiro on the spot, as well as three Chinese factory owners named Xu Kunyuan, Zhang Tingcai, and Chen Xiubin, and seized a large number of cloths and other materials. They took them back for interrogation. According to the confession of the enemy fugitive, he used to work as a clerk in the 3064th unit and admitted that he had cut down trees in Zhenru, Dachang, and Pengpu for military use. He asked to be sent to the General Corps for punishment according to law.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Four Enemy Factories Resume Operation After Takeover</h3>
<p>Since the Economic Department's Special Envoy Office for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui sent personnel to take over enemy factories in this city, they have been actively resuming operations so that production will not be interrupted and the livelihoods of workers can be maintained. So far, the department has taken over ten machinery factories, including Tianlu Copper Smelting Plant, and fourteen chemical factories, including Shanghai Rubber Industry Society, a total of twenty-four factories, all of which have resumed operation one after another, and the results have been excellent.

<h3>Repatriation of Japanese Residents Still Requires Half a Year</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] In order to understand the current situation of Japanese residents in Shanghai, the reporter visited the Japanese Residents Management Office yesterday. Deputy Director Zou Ren explained the following:</p>
<p>There are currently 74,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai, freely residing in the four concentration areas of Hongkou and Qimei Road. The Baojia organization is perfect, and the autonomous association is in charge of everything, directly supervised by the Japanese Residents Management Office. Only more than 4,000 Japanese residents have returned to their country so far. Due to the difficulty of obtaining ships, the repatriation time will take at least five or six months. The Japanese prisoners of war in the concentration camp are completely autonomous. Although some prisoners of war are working outside, they are only temporarily dispatched. As for how to use the labor of Japanese prisoners of war to help with the reconstruction, there is still no concrete plan.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Line Slow Trains Resume Operation</h3>
<p>The slow trains No. 21 and No. 22 on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, which departed at 7:00 AM, had been temporarily suspended due to a lack of vehicles. They have now resumed operation since yesterday.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Seven Other Groups Telegraph All Members of the Political Consultative Conference to Express Congratulations and Expectations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Local Association, and seven other groups jointly telegraphed all members of the Political Consultative Conference to express their congratulations and expectations. The original telegram read: "To all members of the Chongqing Political Consultative Conference, the country is broken and urgently needs reconstruction from the beginning. World peace depends on the stability of the Far East. The responsibility of our country is heavy and its relationship is great, unprecedented in history. The responsibility for the merits and demerits of the country rests entirely on the shoulders of the public, and the key lies in the shift of one thought. Chairman Chiang said in his opening speech that "the interests of the nation and the nation should come first, and the interests of the party or individual should come last," and "to support the government, strengthen the government, and not weaken the government," are the most reasonable sayings and the steel framework for the success of the meeting. Time will not come again, opportunities are hard to lose, and the life of the nation is in this moment. We respectfully express our congratulations and expectations with words of criticism and good advice. We hope you will consider it carefully. Signed, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Local Association, Shanghai General Labor Union, Shanghai Farmers' Association, Shanghai Women's Association, Shanghai Education Association, and Shanghai Student Federation".</p>
<h3>A Stroll Through the Qujiang Road Flea Market</h3>
<p>— Pingqi</p>
<p>If you take the No. 1 tram to the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qujiang Road and get off, you will definitely see a large crowd of people from afar, crowded on a piece of ruins left after the war. This is the "Qujiang Road Flea Market," a place where many Shanghai people come specifically from Huxi or Nanshi to "snap up cheap goods."</p>
<p>There are about a hundred stalls in total, but the turnover is very high. Sometimes, the stallholders buy and sell from each other, and the used goods become like "footballs," being kicked around by people. As for the source of these used goods, it is obvious that they are all Japanese items. However, if you question the stallholders about how they acquired them, none of them ever say they bought them directly from Japanese residents' homes. The apparent value of the goods varies greatly. Some stalls only have six or seven pairs of worn-out military boots and a dozen or so coats, while one stall specializes in wooden furniture. This stall is the most elaborate because it even has a tiled shed to provide shelter from the wind and rain. They sell wardrobes, suitcases, sofas, writing desks, five-drawer chests, etc., that are not yet completely worn out, and the prices they ask are by no means lower than those of old furniture shops on Beijing Road. The most eye-catching items are the colorful furoshiki (wrapping cloths) carried by Japanese women, with their vibrant colors, quite dazzling. However, Qujiang Road is full of dust, and the afterglow of the setting sun shines down, making it clear that they have faded from their original colors!</p>
<p>There are also many tea sets and sake sets, but the quality is not good. More interesting are those items brought from their home country, such as the exquisitely crafted "ningyo" (dolls). There are also several small gold paper screens, about a foot high, with quite admirable carving work. Surprisingly, there are almost no books. One female customer selected a furoshiki, and the stallholder specially folded it into a small square and placed it in a flat, rectangular paper box for her. When he took out the box lid, I suddenly saw two characters written neatly on it—"National Debt"! The Japanese people bought an astonishing amount of "National Debt," and this is what the warlords and politicians are rewarding them with today!</p>
<p>At first, I heard that the Japanese themselves were setting up stalls, but it turned out that almost all the stallholders were compatriots. Perhaps one or two were Koreans, because their accents were a bit strange. One stallholder told me that there were several "used goods customers" who came every day. They bought cheap and then sold them at high prices in the display windows of their own shops. They are the ones who really make big money because they have a lot of capital. The stallholders, due to their limited cash flow, are often forced to sell cheaply. On a good day, they can earn tens of thousands of legal tender, but on a bad day, they can also lose money.</p>
<p>There is really everything at the flea market: things to wear, things to use, things for children to play with, as well as radios, gramophones, bed curtains, bedding, hats, military blankets, suitcases, electrical materials, Western-style clothing, etc. There are also two noodle stalls, with a surprisingly large number of customers and a thriving business. However, in this large open space, perhaps only these two noodle stalls have "genuine fixed prices." At the flea market, bargainers often offer three thousand, while sellers counter with only five hundred, and yet the transaction is successfully completed.</p>
<p>When I squeezed out of the "siege," three or four Japanese residents with white strips of cloth wrapped around their arms happened to pass by. They lowered their heads and quickened their pace. North Sichuan Road and Qujiang Road used to be the places they were most familiar with, and today's scene is like this. I would very much like to know what they think. Although the fields are "already" overgrown with weeds, I still hope they will go back soon. To be honest, Shanghai is experiencing a housing shortage, and the thousands of houses in Hongkou have been occupied by them for too long.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Changzhi Warship</h3>
<p>— Shutao</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Shipyard has a long history, and the recent turmoil has greatly changed its appearance. There are now three docks, and the Changzhi warship is berthed in the easternmost one. There are five platoons of soldiers standing at attention on board, who will soon disembark in order. They happily went north. They are in black clothes and white hats, extremely magnificent, truly enviable. I walked up to a soldier and explained my purpose, requesting permission to board the ship for a visit. After he took my name card to Commander Chang, a young officer with a steady gait and bright eyes came out a minute later. I explained my intention again and was granted permission. He then led me to various parts of the ship for a tour.</p>
<p>More Than Two Hundred Officers and Soldiers on the Whole Ship</p>
<p>The young officer was Lieutenant Zhu Liangquan from Yangzhou, who spoke with refinement. We entered the reception room, which was neatly and simply furnished. In addition to the tables and chairs covered with white cloth, there was a small paifang (archway) about two feet high and one foot wide in the corner of the room. On the paifang was a red wooden plaque of "Mazu, the Heavenly Mother," presumably the talisman of the Japanese warship. Just as I was about to ask a question, Lieutenant Zhu began to tell me about the warship. He said that Commander-in-Chief Chen often stayed on the ship. Captain Deng Zhaoxiang and Executive Officer Cheng Fakan were both out on official business, and he was currently responsible for everything. Today, because it was a Sunday holiday, the soldiers on the port side could have four hours of rest from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, while the soldiers on the starboard side worked as usual. There were more than two hundred officers and soldiers on the whole ship, including twenty-six Japanese technicians who were in the process of handing over their duties and would soon be sent back to their country.</p>
<p>The Changzhi warship is the largest of the enemy ships received by the Chinese Navy. It was originally named the Uji gunboat, with a displacement of 1,350 tons. It uses gasoline as fuel and has a speed of 20 nautical miles per hour. It was commissioned on October 30, 1941 (Showa 16), participated in the Battle of Hong Kong on December 8, 1942, and was converted into the flagship of the Yangtze River Fleet in 1943. Later, because the fleet suffered heavy losses, it was converted into a escort ship. This shows that the enemy fleet had reached a dead end at that time and was bound to be defeated without a fight.</p>
<p>Well-Equipped with Weapons</p>
<p>The Changzhi warship is armed with three 120mm main guns, nine 24mm machine guns, and one depth charge launcher. In May last year, the enemy reinstalled a radar system (called "dentan" in Japanese). After the victory of the War of Resistance and the unconditional surrender of the enemy, the Chinese Navy officially accepted the Uji gunboat on September 13 and renamed it the Changzhi warship. All the equipment on the ship was undamaged. The radar had only been installed for more than four months from the time of installation to the time of surrender, so it can be said to be the most well-equipped enemy warship received.</p>
<p>After being received, the Changzhi warship was reorganized into the flagship of the Second Fleet of the Navy, with five warships under its command. On Double Ten Day (October 10th), it sailed to Nanjing. When passing Jiangyin, the New Fourth Army shelled the ship from both banks of the river. One shell landed fifty meters away from the stern of the ship, failing to hit it. At the end of October, it was sent to Taiwan to accept the surrender of the enemy navy, first arriving at Xiamen. Commander-in-Chief Chen Shaokuan took the opportunity to go to Xiamen and then took the Changzhi warship from Xiamen to the ports of Keelung in Taipei, Taiwan, and Magong in the Ryukyu Islands. It returned to Shanghai a month ago. Because the bottom of the ship needed to be repaired, it entered the Jiangnan Shipyard after arriving in Shanghai. After leaving the dock in the future, it may go to Qingdao or be stationed along the Yangtze River, but it has not yet been decided. Lieutenant Zhu's words came to an end. At this time, he led me to visit all parts of the ship. It didn't get used in this war, they wasted a lot of effort, and in the end they failed. That is the fate of overusing weapons.</p>
<p>Visiting the Wheelhouse and Radio Room</p>
<p>Leaving Lieutenant Zhu's room to a small room of five or six square feet, there are five compasses all around. On both sides, the Changzhi warship was originally one of the largest warships received from the enemy. Recently, it was moored in the Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs. There are more than two hundred crew members on the ship, and the weapons and all the equipment are very complete. The Changzhi warship is now a flagship, with five warships under its command. The cannons in the picture are quite powerful, formerly belonging to Captain Deng. Arriving at the commander-in-chief's room, the layout is neat and magnificent, with a long red felt table placed horizontally in the middle, with chairs on both sides and red sofas at both ends. The southwest corner is the commander-in-chief's bedroom. Coming out is the office of the captain, executive officer, and staff. Then I entered Lieutenant Zhu's room, each room having wireless broadcasting and music. Lieutenant Zhu opened a gas mask and said to me, this is also left to us by the enemy, unfortunately, there are two two-foot-long telescopes. I curiously looked through them, but the view was extremely blurry. Lieutenant Zhu smiled and explained to me that this was because of the refraction of the front glass window, so it was not clear. He pointed to the four machine guns beside him, caliber 24-M.M. The firepower is quite strong. From here, down the stairs to the front deck, there are two 12-inch main guns with a range of 15,000 meters. Behind it are four boxes of shells for emergency use, each box containing twelve shells more than two feet long. Further back is the ammunition depot, which can be taken out of the ship by machine and transferred to the ship. He pointed to the radar to show me, and then pointed to the radio room, saying that it might be more interesting inside, because the loudspeaker was broadcasting the Italian army marching song. We then walked to the radio room with excited steps. The equipment in the room is complex, with six wireless military machines, telegraph machines, telephones, and many wires, which made me dizzy. Leaving the radio room, we went to the rear of the ship to visit the depth charge, which looks like a cow's horn, the gun body is about two feet long, and its use is also very mysterious, it is the enemy of submarines.</p>
<p>At this time it was already two o'clock, of course Lieutenant Zhu was very busy, so I didn't dare to delay any longer and wanted to say goodbye. But Lieutenant Zhu kindly asked me to sit in the reception room, and gave me two boxes of 50-watt heat-energy food (Japanese name) for naval use, which is a kind of coconut-flavored candy. And he sincerely told me that the Chinese navy is in its budding stage, and it needs the attention and care of the Chinese people. We have such a long coastline, we face the largest ocean in the world, we have 450 million compatriots, but our navy is so weak. The Chinese navy depends on whether we Chinese have the determination to make it strong. Finally, Lieutenant Zhu hoped that everyone would not forget to build a large navy to maintain world peace forever. Just as we were talking, a messenger suddenly came in to report that Captain Deng and Executive Officer Cheng had returned. So he led me to meet Captain Deng, and after the introduction, we went to the deck to take a photo together, and then I took my leave.</p>

<h3>Discussing "Making Life Artistic"</h3>
<p>— Song Shouchang</p>
<p>"Making Life Artistic" is one of the three major goals of the New Life Movement. The so-called "Making Life Artistic" means filling our daily lives with beautiful emotions. In other words, our lives should feel interesting. The essence of art is beauty, and beauty can bring pleasure to humanity. Therefore, an artistic life can also be said to be a beautiful life.</p>
<p>Loving beauty is a noble human instinct. The natural world is arranged with beautiful environments, such as the clear breeze on the river, the bright moon in the mountains, idle flowers and wild grasses, the sound of pines and clear springs—all of these are beautiful pictures, beautiful music. This kind of natural beauty is everywhere, and we can seek interest in space and time, and feel spiritual pleasure from the stimulation of beauty. Generally, people think that reason and will determine our behavior, but this view is wrong. The driving force behind human behavior is emotion. To have good behavior, we must first have beautiful emotions, and the most effective way to cultivate emotions is through art. If our spiritual life has no connection with art, then our emotional life will inevitably wither, leading to tragic consequences in life, and all kinds of evil thoughts and improper behaviors will arise as a result.</p>
<p>Since art can compensate for the defects of life and relieve the pain of life, to enable the public to enjoy a beautiful life and make life more rational, the only way is to elevate the highest spiritual activity of mankind, which is art, and pay attention to the cultivation of art. In ancient China, governing the country and educating the people relied heavily on the influence of art. As stated in the "Rites of Zhou": "Nurturing the sons of the state with the Way, they are taught the six arts: first, the five physical exercises; second, the six music; third, the five archery skills; fourth, the five horsemanship skills; fifth, the six writing styles; sixth, the nine teachings." In addition, the walls around the Mingtang (Hall of Enlightenment) in the Zhou Dynasty were covered with portraits of Yao, Shun, Jie, and Zhou, as well as pictures of the Duke of Zhou assisting King Cheng, serving as a warning for the rise and fall of the state. These were all facts of using the function of art to help govern the country. Unfortunately, since the Han Dynasty, painting and music have become things for literary scholars and refined gentlemen to express their emotions and leisure interests, and have lost their educational function.</p>
<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, China has been moving towards the road of national construction. In order to improve the morality and personality of the people, the New Life Movement has recently been launched again. "Making Life Artistic" is listed as the first of the three major goals, so we should use the movement of art to build spiritual life. The establishment of art museums and museums, holding exhibitions and music concerts, broadcasting music, building parks everywhere, and the artistic design of urban construction all provide opportunities for the public to come into contact with art. Other things like dramas and movies with social education significance are also related to spiritual life.</p>
<p>Art is not a decoration or entertainment for the idle class, nor is it exclusive to the idle class. Art should be enjoyed by the public, and through the cultivation of art, the people can obtain a beautified life, realizing an artistic life in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. However, the so-called artistic life is not a luxurious life, as long as it meets the conditions of simplicity, plainness, neatness, and cleanliness. This kind of life is the true essence of the "Making Life Artistic" advocated by the New Life Movement.</p>
<h3>"Accepting Fate"</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yi</p>
<p>The typical Chinese view of life is a kind of extreme optimism. The characteristic of this doctrine can be said to be completely included in an idiom, which is "Accepting Fate." The saying "Accepting Fate" is of course familiar to everyone, but few people believe that these four words represent a philosophy, a doctrine, and also a "typical" national essence view of life.</p>
<p>We might as well observe and see how the Chinese people will cope with their environment when they are in extreme hardship and in a very critical situation? Here, I can tell you that most people will: smile leisurely and say, "It doesn't matter, just accept fate!" and let it go. Because they believe that even under the principle of "misfortunes never come singly," when fate is so bad that they are about to be "burned beyond recognition," there will always be "a way out" and "good fortune will follow misfortune!" So, "Let it go!" and "Don't rush!" are unconsciously blurted out.</p>
<p>Of course, in times of crisis, one has to submit to fate, but isn't it the same in times of ease? Have you heard the saying "The poor rely on the rich, and the rich rely on heaven"? It can be seen that the comfortable rich are also "accepting fate." Therefore, everywhere there are people "accepting fate"; students entering the examination hall say they are "accepting fate," farmers waiting for rain also say they are "accepting fate," and poor people who can't afford to see a doctor are even more "accepting fate..."</p>
<p>"Accepting fate" expresses optimism, but it is too easy to become passive. People who hope to "accept fate" should not forget a saying: "Human effort will overcome heaven"!</p>
<h3>Wild Fruits and Others</h3>
<p>— Hong Ye</p>
<p>Wild Fruits</p>
<p>Wild fruits are beautiful.</p>
<p>I often yearn for the beauty of the simple color quality composed of those crimson berries and green vegetable leaves. I thought, how sweet it would be if I put it in my mouth and chewed it carefully!</p>
<p>So, I finally picked it; I admired its beauty and bit it open...</p>
<p>Ah! A bitter taste.</p>
<p>Such a beautiful fruit, but its taste is so bitter.</p>
<p>Youth</p>
<p>People are singing hymns of youth for the green life.</p>
<p>Cry for a while; laugh for a while; sing happily for a while; wail for a while... Youth. Imprint these active traces on the page of life; entrust it to the record of a luxurious life.</p>
<p>Youth is lovely; filled with light and heat.</p>
<p>However, when we reach the twilight of life, do we feel some emptiness of the past? Or have we trampled the leaves of the youth tree for no reason.</p>
<p>Remembrance</p>
<p>Every day, you run to the river to watch the water.</p>
<p>You said, "Rolling river! May you stir up huge waves and carry my friend to the Shanghai Bund."</p>
<p>However, the huge waves rose and fell; fell and rose again, without bringing you any news of friendship. So you were disappointed, and you declared that you would no longer silently pray to the river.</p>
<p>But friend, when you feel empty inside, what could be more melancholy than losing your spiritual support?</p>
<p>Remembrance is a kind of trouble, but isn't it more painful to stop at remembrance?</p>
<h3>Flying Together (4)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Master Mo was only forty years old, but he already looked as old as sixty. And his body was also very bad. He originally had a congenital anemia. He often had dizzy spells; in the past half year, he also had a cough; and he seemed even weaker. The reason for this was partly because his standard of living had suddenly dropped, and he couldn't bear it; partly because his mental state was not good, which affected his health; but Madam Mo strongly denied these two reasons; she said that it was all because Master Mo was too dissolute when he was young, so he ruined his body.</p>
<p>What Madam Mo said was not entirely without reason. Master Mo did play hard when he was young. A year ago, Master Mo was still frequently going in and out of several high-class "singing houses" in Beijing. Master Mo's large sums of money were all sent into this bottomless pit. Madam Mo knew all of this, and it was precisely because of this reason that Master Mo had a handle in Madam Mo's hands, so Master Mo always had a bit of "fear of his wife."</p>
<p>Speaking of it, Master Mo was still related to the imperial family! Probably his grandmother, was some kind of "princess," and he called Empress Dowager Cixi "Grandmother." Therefore, he was also listed as a member of the nobility, although the relationship was very distant.</p>
<p>In his youth, Master Mo was a complete playboy. Relying on a bit of intelligence, he passed the imperial examination at the age of twenty. Later, relying on some connections in the court, he served as several officials, big and small. During Master Mo's career as an official, it could be said that he enjoyed all the glory and wealth! At that time, he had no time to worry about the future. In his consciousness, this world would not belong to others.</p>
<p>It seemed that Madam Mo had foresight, but it was also forced by the situation. When Master Mo was at his most successful, she couldn't stand Master Mo spending all day drinking and making merry, squandering money like dirt; so she had a big fight with him, and then resolutely took her son, Bao Ling, who had just turned five years old; and left Beijing. She moved to Jingzhou City in Hubei Province, in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. This was four years ago.</p>
<p>Jingzhou had become a stronghold for Manchu immigrants. Therefore, Madam Mo was not lonely here. She had many relatives and friends who helped Madam Mo buy a house from the Han people—the courtyard house where she still lives now, and dozens of acres of land. Madam Mo had some masculine qualities, so she bravely built a simple home independently. She also often received some money from Master Mo to live on, but she didn't reveal any hint of seeking help or begging. She was very self-respecting. She had a strength and stubbornness that ordinary women did not have; she had no knowledge, but she understood things; she was rich in emotions, but when her emotions were hurt; she became cold and eccentric. Her heart was kind. She sympathized with people who shared her fate. She was merciless to everything she hated; even retaliating with blows!</p>
<h3>Friend and Foe, Plus One More</h3>
<p>— Dan Ni</p>
<p>Are they friends, or enemies?</p>
<p>At the grand banquet, they raised their glasses and wished each other good health.</p>
<p>They showed the highest friendship.</p>
<p>But as soon as the banquet ended, they used their own vicious means to try to eliminate each other.</p>
<p>They are friends. They are also enemies.</p>
<h3>Badge of Victory</h3>
<p>This is a V-shaped badge of victory.</p>
<p>The humble bronze also shines with the golden light of victory.</p>
<p>Who lost it?</p>
<p>Is the price of this badge of victory too low that you lightly abandoned it?</p>
<p>Child, come here, I will put this badge of victory on you! This is the badge of victory that only you deserve to wear!</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Poems on the Lake</h3>
<p>— Ruo Piao</p>
<p>The west wind blows over Duanjia Bridge, I remember Hong bringing wine in a gourd, the willows of Xiang are like people, they have changed now, a single boat, two are desolate.</p>
<p>Oars stir the withered waves and splash the water, West Lake is full of sorrow, barbarian hooves trampled idle flowers and grass, I am the first person to climb the broken pavilion.</p>
<p>The iron bones stand firm by the water's edge, I have been dreaming of Gushan for ten years, returning to receive the whiteness of heaven, the cloth robe flutters in the wind, the sun is not yet setting.</p>
<p>The sound of the bell carrying water brings the morning cold, the frost leaves of Fenglin are already slightly red, desolate crows dot the heavy lake waves, I stand at the bow of the boat with my hands behind my back, enduring the sight.</p>
<h3>Returning Late</h3>
<p>— Bi Xichang</p>
<p>The dim sunset, pitifully red; the ruthless twilight, shrouding the earth, extinguishing the last rays of the setting sun.</p>
<p>I drag my heavy steps, stepping on the fallen leaves all the way, groping in the silent deep lane, not seeing a single figure, I have fallen into the encirclement of darkness and gloom, the future is full of terror and danger.</p>
<p>The biting northwest wind is roaring willfully again, but no one can pay attention to it.</p>
<p>It blows on my clear face, and I shiver, refreshing my mind. It seems to give me an enlightenment that in this cold world, I can only use my reason to ignite the fire of life and break the gray dream.</p>
<p>I smile knowingly, exhale a sigh, and use the warmth in my heart to defeat the current cold.</p>
<p>Bi's Spring and Autumn Annals</p>
<h3>Everyone is Number One</h3>
<p>— Wu Renzhi</p>
<p>It is said that this year should be the "Year of Construction." So, teachers say education is number one, industrialists say industry is number one, the transportation industry says transportation is number one, and there are those who engage in economic reform who propose economic construction is number one, and those who advocate rural construction propose rural construction is number one... It seems that everyone is taking advantage of the beginning of the year of construction to compete for the top spot in the start of work. This seems so chaotic!</p>
<p>From a logical point of view, this phenomenon of "number one" is very ridiculous. I am number one, you are number one, and he is number one, and the result is that everyone is number one, which means that everyone has lost the top spot.</p>
<p>However, everyone is focusing on their own position, which should be said to be an excellent phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, true competitors at work are like long-distance runners. They don't haggle over the start, but only strive for the first arrival at the final destination.</p>
<p>The proposal of these diverse "×× is number one" reflects the current phenomenon of China being "riddled with holes" and "everything waiting to be done." It is also a reflection of the fact that everyone has seen this and is frantically trying to come up with ways to rescue it. This cannot be said to be a bad phenomenon either. The problem is only that in the midst of the chaos, we must not only not bump into each other, but also help each other. This is somewhat different from the long-distance runner's struggle to reach the first spot.</p>
<p>Everyone is striving for their arrival to be the first, and they should each have their own complete prerequisites. If we can find a common prerequisite under these many conditions, then this condition may be the real ×× number one.</p>
<p>What is the common prerequisite? I say it is political stability! Education, industry, transportation, economic construction, rural construction... all have to give way. Political stability is still number one!</p>
<p>I say that politics is not on track does not mean that the government has collapsed. On the contrary, it shows the government's huge responsibilities from now on!</p>

<h3>The Sanitation Problem in the West Shanghai District</h3>
<p>— Feng Huanquan</p>
<p>Currently, a major pain for the common people in West Shanghai is the problem of sewage with a foul odor. West Shanghai is a concentration of poor people, especially the working class, who have no funds to rent houses, so they build shacks, forming clusters here and there. As for sanitation, it is painful to talk about. Garbage piles up like mountains, and after a long time, it cannot be piled up anymore, so it is dumped into nearby small rivers. After the small rivers are filled, the poor people build shacks in groups. What is most distressing is that landlords see this as profitable and even try to build houses. Under such circumstances, sewers have already become a serious problem, and filling rivers and building houses only makes things worse. On the other hand, the West Shanghai district has the most small factories. These factories do not care about public health, only thinking about producing and profiting. Therefore, regardless of where the sewers come from, they dump sewage, flooding the ground, making it dirty and foul, and the stench is everywhere. I will give one example, such as the foot of the wall behind a certain pharmaceutical factory on Bailinan Road, and in front of a certain textile factory, etc. The only solution for the residents there is to fill the road with bricks; but at night, there are no lights, and pedestrians often stumble; after their feet are stained with sewage, they are infected with skin rashes. In fact, most of the people in the West Shanghai district are poor, how can they afford these unexpected medical expenses? Originally, the only capital of the poor is their health, so I deeply hope that the Public Works and Health Bureau will quickly promote both curative and preventive measures simultaneously to increase the actual work efficiency. For example, unblocking the sewers is a matter of course, and the filled rivers should be improved with an overall plan. Other garbage and sewage on the ground should be cleared as soon as possible, and sanitary facilities or health propaganda should also be added to the concentrated shanty towns. I hope that this suggestion can be put into practice in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Reader's Letter</p>
<h3>Double Disaster Refugees in Northern Jiangsu Call for Aid with Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>Editor: On March 29, 1938, enemy planes bombed Yancheng. Unfortunately, my humble home was reduced to ashes in an instant. A family of three fled to the countryside, barely surviving by teaching. For eight long years, we were fortunate enough not to suffer from cold and hunger. In October of this year, the communist army occupied Longcheng. At the same time, the place where we lived was regarded as a central location, so we were ordered to dissolve the already-established school and let the borrowed ancestral hall be used as the site of the central elementary school. From then on, our livelihood was cut off. Fortunately, local people maintained it, vacated a house to avoid the wind and rain, and provided food to fill our empty stomachs. But the days ahead are long, how can we sit and eat? Therefore, last month, we took a civilian boat to Shanghai, hoping to become self-sufficient. Unexpectedly, there were too many people at sea, and housing was especially difficult. Although I am able to eke out a living, when I think of my weak wife and young children at home, crying for food, I feel heartbroken! However, in the eight years of the War of Resistance, there are probably many others who have suffered like me. I am just afraid that they are not as miserable as I am. Now, although we have enough to eat, we have no clothes to wear. The price of cloth is so high that it is difficult to buy. I recently read in the newspaper that your column is working with the Winter Relief Association to benefit the poor. Therefore, I am writing to ask you to show your mutual assistance and charity and provide some relief within the possible range. How to provide relief, there are regulations, and I am not in a position to specify. I will listen to your decision. I have received some education and have also made some contributions in my hometown in the past. I have suffered two blows and cannot save myself. I do not want to look up to others. In such a big Shanghai, with so many people, it does not matter if I reveal my real name. However, my conscience is uneasy. According to the relief regulations in the newspaper, there is a clause for hidden poverty, and I am indeed qualified for hidden poverty. The name I have signed is false. I think it does not matter if I pretend to be wealthy. I am sending this letter in advance so that it can be included in the list. Please let me know how to provide relief. Northern Jiangsu double disaster refugee, Wu Jiangyue</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's situation is truly unfortunate! I am publishing the original letter in the hope that fellow villagers in northern Jiangsu will provide relief, either by donating money or giving winter clothing: This column will be happy to collect and forward it. If you are inquiring about the Shanghai Winter Relief Association, the meeting place is on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road. You can take this newspaper and apply in person, hoping that they can find a way to provide relief. (Editor)</p>
<h3>A Night Soil Collector Was Injured for No Reason, Requesting the Car Owner to Provide Relief, His Family Is in Extreme Difficulty</h3>
<p>Night soil collector Zong A'mei, who lives at No. 12 Yongkangli, Caishen Lane, Kangti Road, Yingshi Road (formerly Rue Sapey), was pushing a night soil cart at the entrance of Tireni Hospital on Fuxing Road at 3:00 a.m. on December 25 last year when he was seriously injured by a car. The car fled without a trace, leaving behind a car light and a steel bumper. He was escorted to Tireni Hospital by the US military for treatment, and was transferred to bed No. 61 of Guangci Hospital on the 28th. The injured person now has no medical expenses, his children are young, his wife is weak, and his old mother has just passed away. Daily life is difficult to maintain, and there is no way to borrow money. I pray that the car owner and driver involved in the accident will ask themselves whether their conscience is clear and compensate for the medical expenses. If there are any kind-hearted gentlemen who can help find the case, I will be deeply grateful.</p>
<h3>Service Briefs, Seeking Wireless Talent</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Office of the China Vocational Education Society has recently been commissioned by a certain organization to hire a wireless electrician who is qualified to repair wireless radios. The salary is generous. Those who are interested in applying are requested to go to No. 80 Hualong Road to negotiate in person.</p>
<p>Investigation of Losses of Residents in Zhabei. The Shanghai 14th District Office: "Greetings, our district has been ordered to investigate losses during the War of Resistance. We hope that residents of Zhabei who have suffered losses will come to register at our district office at No. 62 Nanxing Road after seeing the newspaper so that we can compile and forward it. We would be grateful if your newspaper would disclose this in the Social Services column. Yours sincerely, Shen Bao"</p>
<p>Request to Restore Street Lights. Here is something I would like to ask your newspaper to petition on our behalf. The area around No. 1125 Yuyuan Road (i.e., Wuding Road) is the throat of the residents of West Zhu'anbang. There are factories, Western residences, and day and night markets. Before the war, there were street lights installed, which made it convenient to travel at night. Since they were dismantled by thieves, they have not been restored to this day. At night, it is as dark as pitch. Not only do vehicles and pedestrians often collide, but bandits lurk in the area, and cases of looting have occurred repeatedly. The reason for this is nothing more than the failure to restore the street lights. Therefore, we appeal to the road authorities to send personnel to install and light them as soon as possible. The entire residents of West Zhu'anbang</p>
