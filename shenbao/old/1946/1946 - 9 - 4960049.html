<h3>三人委員會二次會停戰命令日內將發出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山八日午夜廣播稱：馬歇爾今日參加三人委員會會談後宣稱：「停戰」命令于最近數日內即可發出。</p>
<p>〔合眾社重慶八日電〕三人委員會於今晨開會三小時後，對發出「停止開火」命令未能獲得協定，今晚將舉行第二次會議。一部份人士雖感失望，然與會者在晨會於上午一時結束時，似頗樂觀。會中由美總統駐華特使馬歇爾將軍担任主席，渠於走出會議室時，情緒似頗良好，但除告各特派員今日不必期待公報外，不願發表任何意見。國民政府代表張羣告中國記者謂：渠信政府之「停止開火」命令，將于一月十日政治協商會議舉行第一次會議前發出。共產然代表局恩來告中國記者謂：共產黨之「停止開火」命令，可能于「二三日內」發出。今日第二次會議在四時半（重慶時間，上海時間爲五時半）舉行，衆信討論範圍，將包括下列四大要點：（一）「停止開火」公式；（二）恢復交通；（三）在共產黨控制各區之接受日軍役降；（四）將日軍撤返本國。當三人委員會方研究此等問題時，協商會議政府代表之一王世杰外交部長，建議國共雙方應在宣傳戰與前綫方面，同時「停止開火」。王氏稱：渠以爲兩黨之互相攻擊，對談判有損無益。共產黨宣傳主任陸定一（亦爲協高會議會員）在政治協商會議今日舉行預備會議時，亦同意此點。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>論美棉借款</h3>
<p>美國對華的美棉借款，其總額爲三千三百萬美元，足購美棉三十萬包，可供我國一年之用，其償還期在十五個月以上。所有細則，雖尚待商定，大體當無變更。我們從這項消息，應該明白：（一）紡織事業，無論官營民營，雖在同時進行之中，面主要原料的棉花，缺少尚多。（二）不得不購買外棉以資抵補，但缺少外滙頭寸。（三）外商欲對華推銷其貨物時，不得不同時供給借款。同時傳民生公司向美購買輪船，美亦允供給借款一千五百萬美元。兩相對照，這項事實的眞相，愈爲顯豁。</p>
<p>原來我國在美已經解凍的資金，據傳，只有三萬萬五千萬美元，這個數目，在平時尚不够一年對美輸入的支付額。如果國際間的收付，沒有其他來源來抵銷，那麼，等於赤手空拳。對於國外物資的需要，無論如何迫切，還是可望而不可即的。</p>
<p>現在一般人的心目之中，似乎一筆善後的大借款，終楚不可避免的。况且杜魯門總統，在他宣佈的對華政策中，也已明白表示，此事可以商量。所以只求物資充分地進口，餘事似可綏待。却不知道筆大借歌，在現在還是畫餅，短期內，未可過有奢望，美國人於此也很明白，所以急其所急，先來一個零星解次，藉以應付目前。而且大借歌縱使成立了，倘沒有其他的來源來抵補，也終非持久之計，萬方屬目的外滙比率，到今日，還沒有宜佈。這其間的問題，雖然很多，而這個頭寸問題，無疑地也是這些問題之一。</p>
<p>要解次這個問題，其實很簡單。從治標來說，無論整個解次也好，零星解次也好，終不出借款的一途·從治本來說，却不能不從推廣出口貿易上人手。我國的外滙資金，除掉僑滙和外人的公私用款，佔其一小部份外，大部份還是總靠在出口貨上。</p>
<p>有人以爲對外交通隔絕了許久，各國對於我國的土產，需要甚殷，只消外滙和航運問題能够解次，出口事業的前途，很可樂觀，這或許一部份是眞理。何以故？國外的胃口，雖然很好，而兵燹以後，癒痍徧地，各種土貨的產額，已遠不及從前。例如江浙一帶的蠶絲事業，因爲桑地殘毀的太多了，短期間內必感無法恢復。共他如桐油，如茶葉等，也有同樣的情形。何况復員以後，內地許多區域，共治安、交通、和金融，都未能完全恢復。那麼，生產事業，怎能迅速復原？</p>
<p>所以談到國際貿易，就不能不聯想到國內貿易：談到國內貿易，又不能不聯想到政治問題。任何黨派，任何階級，假如他們是認國家和民族的利益，是超過一切，是至高無上的，那就應該拋棄私見，先來趕緊恢復交通，安定秩序，然後可以復興產業，增加對外貿易。</p>

<h3>駐爪哇總領事蔣家棟赴巴達維亞履新滯留吉隆坡我軍官遭英軍擊傷　我已提出賠償懲罰道歉等要求</h3>
<p>〔中央社新加坡八日電〕我國新任駐爪哇總領事蔣家棟，今夜離此赴巴達維亞履新，又陳嘉庚請英當局採取有效步驟，制止馬來亞北部吉隆坡馬來亞人之排華行動。過去六週內，華僑七人遇難，百人被擊負傷，住宅三所被焚燬，另有民家二十六所被刧，馬來亞人計有五十萬，華僑僅二萬五千人。</p>
<p>〔中央社吉隆坡六日電〕此間於一月三日下午發生一不幸事件，我軍一百卅六人，中有聯絡官二人，遭英憲兵及軍隊擊傷，我方已向英聯絡官費寗中校提四項要求：（一）交還武器，（二）賠償損失，（三）懲罰負責軍官，（四）在報端公開道歉，其中第一項英方已予接受，其他三項明日答覆。我某軍官與記者談稱：除非四項要求遵行滿意，則我方將採取合法行動，同時全部事實已通知中國商會及國民黨吉隆坡支部，兩處均允諾若四項要求非獲完滿答覆，將召集當地全體華僑團體會商對策。據我軍官告事件經過稱：此事發生於三日下午，我軍聯絡官張文森（譯音）全劇武裝，駕車停於彼等所居之萊克斯旅館門外時，有英軍官一人及荷軍官一人亦駕一車，該英籍軍官竟毫無理由，令我軍官駕車往警察局，張乃予拒絕，並切斷車上電錢，使其車不能開動，英軍官使荷軍官拔槍看守張氏，彼則召來憲兵卅餘人，警察五十人及兵士若干人，衝向少數我國軍官，企岡解除我方槍械。衝突中我軍官二人被槍柄繫中頭部重傷，英方軍憲包圍我軍所居之旅館房間，取去槍械，軍裝，手錶及自來水筆，甚至錢財。當時英方聯絡官費寧及柯爾伯克兩中校均在塲，然未能阻止，事件發生時，我軍官五十六人中，大多數出外晚餐。按我軍官係在此集中，候交通工具返國，自日軍投降後，彼等即要求遣送回國，然至今仍未獲得交通工具，未悉何故。</p>

<h3>中印公路存廢問題　尙未獲最後決定　油管前途亦有三種傳說</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明八日鴛〕中印公路與中印油管之存廢問題，雖爲此間一般人士所極關心者，但迄今仍未聞最後的具體決定。中印公路中之保密公路，事實上殆已廢棄，蓋因保密路路面，旣未達成原定標準，而抗戰勝利後，該路之存在，不受某國歡迎，路局曾擬在密支那使用自備之無綫電合，亦遭某方面的禁止，這一條中美人士血汗築成的戰時公路，殆將成爲歷史上的名字。至於中印油管的前途，此間有三種傳說：（一）拆除，將全部器材移交甘肅油礦局裝置油管。此項工程最困難者，首為運輸問題，次為款項無着，據估計，約需一百萬萬元，這是中印油管工程處最初的計劃之一，現據該處高級職員談，此事恐難實現。（二）中印油管，將由美商接辦說，據聞亞細亞，德士古，美孚三洋行，現在渝與我政府商談，如能迅速解決，預料可於二月間開始輸油。（三）繼續維持現狀說，短期內旣不恢復輸油，也不予以廢棄，等待中美變方政府的決定，郭　富處長現仍在渝，正向有關方面請示油管的善後問題，油管工程處人員，現仍繼續工作，截至本日止，尚未奉到結束或其他命令。</p>

<h3>美代表團成立五人委會原子問題有保障</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕美國務卿昨出發赴倫敦前發表宣言，保證國會對於美國將原子能智識移交聯合國原子委員會之任何行動，保留最後之發言權，並宣布設立一五人委員會，由副國務卿艾克遜任主席，委員爲前助理國務卿麥克勞·美國方面監督並發展原子能之專家蒲許博士·康南特博士·及格羅夫斯少將組成，以研究必需之管制與保障，使美國人民於聯合國委員會開始執行任務時，得悉其如何進行。貝氏並稱，聯合國委員會所關懷者，非原子能之如何產生，而爲如何能爲和平利益而加以管制。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕國務卿貝爾納斯到達倫敦後，即將召開出席大會美代表團會議，就原子能管制問題，向彼等提供保證，與渠向全國保證者無異。貝爾納斯昨向國內外人民聲明：（一）將來組織之原子能委員會，無權要求美國所不願供給之科學情報。聯合國安全委員會企圖獲得此項情報時，美國得應用否決權，予以制止。（三）委員會如得美國同意通過決議，促進交換此項情報，則最後決定美國參加之權，操諸國會之手。</p>

<p>〔合衆社八日倫敦電〕美代表團所面臨之第一個問題，係關於投票選舉大會主席，秘書長及安全會議之非常任會員。衆信美代表團贊成東歐國代表担任大會秘書長，大概不出比利時外長史派克·荷蘭克萊芬·或挪威外長賴埃三人之一。蘇聯如堅持秘書長一職必須由歐人担任，則美國贊成推舉捷克外長馬薩立克。倘東歐與西歐國家之間形成僵局，則美國將提出加拿大駐美大使潘爾遜，以示讓步。美國所推荐之安全會議亦非常任代表，包括南美之巴西及中美之墨西哥。預料埃及將獲得一席，代表中非及東非，加拿大及澳大利亞將代表自治領地及遠東。</p>

<h3>日本內閣中黷武份子至少六人將去職昨開第三次會議但仍無結果　幣原有於普選後自動引退說</h3>
<p>〔本報東京八日電〕日本內閣今日召開第三會議，對內閣辭職問題，仍將留待幣原決定。然幣原究於何日病癒返任視事，至今未聞切確日期。說者有謂此係政府故意採用延宕政策，以輕減外間之壓力。內閣書記長官次田，謂非俟幣原返任，不能有所決定。昨日曾傳外相吉田將晉謁麥帥請示，然迄今日下午止，猶未實現，盟方人士認爲此事應聽由日人自行解決，以試騐其本身能否作建設性之抉釋，至今所悉者內閣中至少有六人將因此去職，但幣原猶希望能避免內閣總辭職之厄運。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京八日電〕據今日消息：幣原首相由於麥帥指令肅淸公務機關內曾與軍部有若干關係之一切人物，雖傳已準備至少將閣負六人免職，但內閣如決定總辭職時，渠已決定推薦首相一職之繼承人。指令初發出時之倉皇情形，似已減低。據各方消息：幣原。將在黑單上有名之閣員免職後，擬組織某種形式之聯合政府。預定去職之閣員六人，爲：農林大臣松村謙三·內務大臣堀切善次郎·國務大臣次田大三郎·文部大臣前田·電信大臣田中良雄與國務大臣松　　治。爲補充此等人物起見，聞幣原準備於各政黨與公衆方面遴選各大臣候補人，俾組織新聯合政府，在此過渡期間，政府將準備普選工作。一俟選舉之後，政府將自動引退。幣原稱：設此舉失敗，渠將與內閣共同解職。此外渠並將向日皇建議可能之繼承人，以定一前例。先前日皇常徵詢內大臣之意見，由其召集元老及樞密院議長會議，以定新首相人選。目下內大臣一職業已取消，結果日皇或須徵求辭職首相之意見，由後者與樞密院議長及貴衆兩院議長舉行會議後，再行推薦另一複雜之事，即日皇於決定人選之後，須將名單給與盟軍統帥部，設後者不予核准，勢須再覓新人物。一部份觀察家以爲：幣原對繼承人問題旣有所決定，可見渠並不忽視內閣總辭職之極大可能性。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京八日專電〕幣原內閣應全體辭職之意見，現日趨有力，蓋內閣各大臣，（除臥病之幣原首相外，）復於今晨會商麥帥所頒之淸除指令，多數內閣大臣於非正式交換意見時，均曾表示如忠實執行麥帥之指令，內閣即將大規模改組。此實與組織新政府無異。</p>
<p>肅情黷武份子　需要相當時日</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京八日電〕今日閣議中所討論者大的包括昨日已暫加批准之詔書二件，正式公布麥帥指令，其一禁絕右派團體，其一不准超國家主義者担任官職。次田又稱：此項指令至爲棘手，非假以相常時日，難以施行，因麥帥總部未規定限期，此點當可邀准。單祇調查政府各官員在戰事活動情形，以確定其是否擁護軍國主義，即非二三個月不能將報告收齊。職是之故，主要官員將首先革退，隨後及於次要官僚。在下屆選舉中立塲淸白可以參加競選者，政府擬波給證書。但一般言之，因人數衆多之故，政府將於彼等宣布候選後再個別加以鑑別，以視是否合格。指令條文已予公佈，俾候選人可先事「自加判斷」云。</p>
<h3>英科學家謂蘇聯　發明新原子炸彈　使英美原子彈相形見絀</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦特里八日電〕英國科學家安買托博士今日宣稱：蘇聯已發明一種最新式原子炸彈，英美原子彈與之相較，已成明日黄花。蘇聯原子彈且可大規模製造，其式樣與網球一般大小，炸力橫的方面可達五十六哩，縱的方面可達六又十分之二哩强，其發出之熱度，可達攝氏數百萬度。英美原子彈之破壞力，係由油原子決定，蘇聯原子彈係藉旋轉或角度運動發出力量，用之於工程方面，更爲適宜。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕安買托博士所稱蘇聯已發明最新式原子彈之說，此間原子彈專家今日不願直接加以批評，僅謂據最近憑證，美國現在所有原子能智識，即使爲他國所獲得，從而製造原子彈，亦須數年之久，始能有成。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約八日電〕英國科學家安買托傳士稱蘇聯已發明新式原子炸彈。使英美原子炸彈相形見絀，茲據紐的講壇報載劍橋大學原子彈專家韋斯庫夫博士之批評，謂蘇聯發明此項炸彈云云，似屬無稽之談，蓋欲從少量鈾子發揮多量熱能，爲絕對不可能之事云。</p>
<h3>山下奉文要求移民庭審理　檢察官反對重審</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七日專電〕被判絞刑之山下奉文，今日向美最商法院要求移交民庭審理。美軍律師已將山下辯稱其軍隊並無犯罪行爲之請求書，轉呈最高法院。山下之辯護律師稱：此被判罪之戰犯，與美政府機構處理下之全體人類，有同等法律上之權利，然政府檢察官則對山下企圖，請最高法院審理一事，加以駁斥，謂戰爭期內，山下不能享取由美國法院審理之權利，並仍堅持美軍事委員會有權審判違反戰爭法之山下。此案引起之法律問題，爲軍事法庭之權力，是否隨戰爭停止或戰爭結東而消滅。山下之辯護律師對美軍事委員會所舉山下案件，可由軍事法庭或國際法庭審理之主張，表示遺憾。政府檢察官對山下企圖重審，並宣佈若以民庭承審戰犯，最後可能失去司法之作用，按美政府定明日結東辯論。</p>

<h3>宋院長為平抑物價　令出信封存物資　召集有關首長指示辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院宋院長於親察平津靑三地一般敵僞產業處理情形以及指示今後發展華北工業經濟之具體辦法後，已於前日重行蒞滬，對滬市日來復趨上漲之物價，頗為關心，故於昨最入時半赴中國銀行二樓行政院駐滬辦事處召見徐寄　劉鴻生彭學沛劉攻芸等，垂詢物價近狀後，即於十時出席上海區敵僞產業審議會第三十次會議，對</p>
<p>抑平物價</p>
<p>指示尤詳。現敵僞產業處理局已決定於廢曆年底前，將封存之大批物資，儘速出售應市，計有冬季棉布及各　布疋二萬疋，台灣糖七百餘噸，冷藏魚蛋猪肉一餘噸，其他日用品如火柴，肥皂，捲煙，藥品，鐵釘，鐵絲均將寬放限度，大量供應，其中火柴一項，據劉鴻生氏語記者，渠担保在每箱十二萬之價格無限制供應。又燃料管理委會鑒於冬令燃料需要股切，亦決將所存之大量白煤屑</p>

<p>春秋最後燙髮的姑娘  魯莽　　我來到這燙髮的城市，隨處碰到燙髮的姑娘；那瘦瘦的臉更瘦了；那肥肥的臉更肥了；那年青的反而老一些；那半老的更顯得暮氣。黃色的皮膚的四週，捲曲着許多頭毛，並不比白色的好看；然而我碰到的盡是些燙髮的姑娘！　　在一個僻靜的所在，有一位素服的姑娘，只有她，保持着天然的風度，烏絲直垂在耳邊，頸邊；整齊的，秀麗的，保持着東方的情調。　　我出神了，我便凝注着她。不錯，她的純黑的頭髮與烏黑的眼珠，相映成趣！於是我欣慰，我喜悅，這城市還有不燙頭髮的姑娘。　　我幾次走過她的門前，我幾次鑑賞她未捲曲的直髮。現在她開始以懷疑的眼光注視我的眼光了。現在，她知道我在注視她的頭髮了；現在，她以抱歉的眼光回答我的眼光了。但我不知道抱歉的是什麼？　　我從相反的方向，再走過她的門前，有一位不熟識的姑娘，燙着蓬蓬的頭髮，朝着那一面，過去我來一面的方向，鄭重其事的立着。當我走過這位燙髮的姑娘的前面，似乎聽到黄鶯似的聲響，我回過頭去，天呀，逍就是那位不燙髮的姑娘。　　現在她竟燙髮了！我怔住；她却微笑了，笑容中含着諂媚，我可眞的怔住了。　　這最後燙髮的姑娘，她又不明白我怔住的眞意，以爲爲勉燙了的髮怔住了。　　我確是爲了她燙了的髮怔住了，只不過我所「怔」的，不是她所意會的「怔」呀！　　這最後燙髮的姑娘，我們是最後一次會面了。雨花  施濟美　　那七色的長虹，據說是人間到天上的橋樑；然而這座橋是不易見的，必須在一場大的風雨之後才會出現，而且只有一刹那。　　玫瑰之所以美麗，乃是因爲有刺；吾則，那動人嬌紅的月季豈不亦將被人歌頌了麼？　　孔雀有美麗絕倫的毛羽向人炫耀，當它開屛的時候，幾乎獨霸宇宙，然而除此以外，它却是百無一用。至於駱駝，這醜陋的動物，却能在乾枯沒有水源的沙漠地帶，犧牲了自己的生命予旅客們以一些恩惠，因爲在那難看的形相內藏着一個有用的儲水的　。　　於是我們想到造物者的全能和偉大，對於萬物是何等的公正無私。　　「州當寒冬遠去，春光來到時，什麼將使得你最歡喜？」她問　　「太多了，」我思索了一下，「水國裏有南風帶來的春天的微笑，還有，那婉囀的鶯啼，燕的淸歌，花明與柳暗，碧雲天和芳草地……」　　她點點頭，却又搖搖頭，笑着：「你說得不錯；但是，爲什麼忘了說：那一聲春雷，它將蟄伏的萬物全都喚醒，復蘇？」　　年年，從春到夏到秋到冬，再到來年的春天；我看着桃花開了又　，運花開了又謝，菊花開了又謝，梅花開了又謝……一連串的花開與花謝，不曾引起我有過牛絲的惆悵，從不曾有動於中　　你說我太忍心麼？不！在來年的園林裏，它們全會重開的。花草的靑春雖然太短促，可是却不比人們，靑春以是僅有的一次，它們的青春卻是久長的。生命與真理  洪野　　「當生命像柔歌般　行時，那不難使人們得到歡笑，但是，眞止有價值的人呢？　是在一切逆流中含着微笑的人。」　　想起這話，就使我連想到許多朋友們，他們同我一樣的年靑，一樣的苦難地生活着，但是，他們沒有一點怨恨，　　他們懂得這眞理，和我一樣。　　世界上的眞理是有限的，能够抓住這有限的眞理中昇華的一環，不能算是最偉大面且僅有的超人嗎？　　然而，當澎湃的現實之狂潮奔騰於人生的平原時，這超人會不會跟着澎湃的浪花而沉入永恒之淵的底里去呢？　　這於我永遠是一件疑案。　　（二）　　「能够與黑暗奮鬥的人並不算最可貴，眞正最可貴的人是能够在黑暗中覓尋黑暗之原的人。」　　我決不驚異這不平凡的超特，而只驚異這超特的可怕。　　暗黑是世界文明的無盡藏，即使你與它奮鬥，毀滅其無盡藏的一部份，但其他衆部份還會接踵而來的。有什麼用呢？於是人們便祗有擎起這眞理之火把去覓尋黑暗了。這似乎是很澈底的，不過當四面八方的無數起罪惡的，虛僞的，無聊的暴風吹來時，這爲黑暗的霧所包圍的小火花，不會很快的僵熄嗎？除非再燃起以勇氣的火柴。　　然而，這勇氣的火柴是否易得？　　（三）　　　「當你心中感到痛苦的時候，就沉醉你自已吧。」　　是的，痛苦的滋味是很難忍受的，我知道得很淸楚；因爲我無時不在痛苦中徘徊着。我想：現在應該是沉醉的時候了吧？　　於是，我擎起一杯酒尚喉嚨里灌下去，毫無顧慮的；兩杯，三杯……以至於十杯酒的時候，我是深深地醉倒了，這可痛快，然而遺憾的是醉的在笑里滲入了太多的眼淚。　　人與人之間永遠是虛僞的，除了夢藝與酒醉，是永遠不能實現那爲人憧憬的眞摯的善美的原始性的。　　然而，當我酒醒的時候，當我仍不得不哭和笑，不說謊和欺騙的時候，不會感到更大的痛苦嗎？這不能解脫的矛盾乃是人生永恒的大悲哀。印象  登臨　　爲了安全，兩年前，我從上海到了自由的屯溪。在屯溪，我流浪了將近一年。在那裏的一切，將成了我生命史上重要的一頁　　靜靜的街道上，不見幾個人跡，從街楓院落的隙里，望過去是一片深邃的黎里，我漫無目的地向前漫進着。　　天邊醞釀着玄色的雨雲，彷彿幽靈似的陰冥。林叢同時激揚着瑟瑟的西風。偶然有一片桐葉颯的從枝上落下，却又被身後的風吹去，慢慢地，在空中旋飛。我停下脚步注視，這一抹秋光，使我神經上起了震顫，身子也好像被葉兒載起，飄着，飄着，到了天之一方，，「……萬葭蒼蒼，白露爲霜；……」，我腦海中漸漸浮起了一副屯溪的秋景：漢漢如烟的寒山，枯藤老樹，昏雅小橋，流水人家，古道西風瘦馬，夕陽西下，斷腸人在天涯。這一副像漸漸地消滅了，但我腦海中又浮起了一副屯溪的春景：新雨初晴的時候，欣欣向榮的草木，遠山含笑，流鶯喚人。四野雲黃，平疇麥浪，一波萬疊：禾苗初茁，遍地皆靑。這一副像又漸漸地消滅了。我不斷地踏着輕快的步子向前進着，屯溪的印像，不住地在腦中浮出。筆底春秋勝利的觸角  慕容隨　　勝利到了上海以後，上海人首先蒙到了勝利光榮是「　」；「勝利客飯」「勝利筵席」以至於「勝利餅干」「勝利糖果」等等，上海商人發了「勝利財」了，但是多數上海人的「嘴吧」，也嚐過勝利的滋味了。　　第二當然是衣：看見了隨着勝利而來的人們是怎樣打扮，就認爲這好像是「勝利的衣服」。大家去設法模仿，以爲如此穿着，就可以在自己的臉上堆着一點「勝利的微笑」了？雖然近於制服一類的裝飾，是有冒充的罪嫌的，但是他們也得用盡心思去「想」。最低的限度，是「雖不能至，然心嚮往之」。　　最後，就是跟着隨勝利而來的人們，學着打一點「勝利腔」。雖然不敢說是勝利是我們的血或汗所換得來的；但至少也給人家認爲你與「勝利的由來」，不無一點關係。倘然還會動動筆頭的話，還可以來一點「勝利八股」湊湊熱鬧；就使以前也寫過「某種」八股的人——和以前曾拿過「某種」鎗桿的人一樣——都不妨事，因爲贊美是天下第一件最妥常的「玩兒」！觀海  盧冠六　　極目浩茫茫，波濤接大　，祇餘天上覆，無復地相望。日月常吞吐，華夷此界　，尾閭今失險，萬國一輩航。雙宿雙飛（二）  趙清閣　　（二）　　墨老爺看罷這張不知從哪兒被風刮來的一篇似懂不懂的文字，心裏有些奇怪，想着：這必定又是那班維新人物的玩意兒。於是，不大高興地把牠摺起來。這時，忽然發現紙背面有用銀珠寫的四個大字，爲：　　「眞理正義」　　這一下，可讓墨老爺吃驚不小！他不明白這到底是什麼意義？尤其他爲這渲染着警惕性的顏色底四個大字，而感受很大的刺激。他把牠展開再看一遍；而且攤在桌上，縐緊了眉頭朋聲誦讀；他希望能從這種用心咀嚼中，得到個明確的理解。但是，無論如何，他得不到一個答案，越看越糊塗，越讀越沉重！後來，他就索興把牠揉搓成一團，站起身，走到艙一外，再扔向海洋裏！　　海洋像受到一個騷動，立刻興風作浪起來！墨老爺的船動蕩得不能行駛，而且有傾覆的危險　　墨老爺被顛箥得站不住脚，於是迎忙躲進艙內。如今他已經忘記了那張紙的事情。他只大聲嚷着呌掌舵人小心。　　「舟子，要牢牢穩穩地把住舵哇！」　　墨老爺的話，舟子沒有回應。風浪依然不平息，眼看這隻小船就要被巨浪吞食了。於是墨老爺又嚷着：　　「快掉轉頭向後走吧，舟子！到後面找個小碼頭靠岸！」　　舟子仍舊不回應，船在一個大翻身下，墨老爺不再感到顚菠了，只覺得有些頭目眩暈，他想想這準是剛才震動的太厲害。同時墨老爺明白舟子已經聽了他的話。在他的意識裏：彷彿他是要到長江上游的一個什麼地方去，如今旣然走不通，他便決定再沿着長江下游回到京城去。　　船果然是向後駛了。原來，上駛是逆風，所以難行進；如今下駛倒是順風，於是便順流而下；大有一瀉千里之勢！　　墨老爺的頭目眩暈得簡直有些心慌起來，他耐不住又走向艙外，他要探望探望風浪平息了沒有。　　「我的天！你打算把我載回到哪裏去呀？舟子！」　　墨老爺更驚呌了，他發怒地叱令舟子趕快停泊下來，可是這次舟子沒聽他的話。自然，舟子也奈不了風浪的何！　　墨老爺完全絕望了，他顫慄地跪在甲板上，他把兩手緊按住那塊胸前的金黄色的織錦「補子」，喃喃地祈禱着：　　「老佛爺，顯顯靈吧保佑您的外孫子平安！一道聖旨，讓風浪平息！」　　然後，他閉起眼請，鎭靜而虔誠地期待着一個神威的靈騐。　　但是，風浪照樣瘋在一般地洶湧不止，墨老爺，和墨老爺的船，在神威不可挽救的情形下，終於逐流而逝——　　墨老爺僵直地依然屈着兩條膝，他的思想已想停滯在死亡裏！　　船身翻了幾個筋斗，打了幾個旋渦，便滴溜溜沉到海底！於是，墨老爺和墨老爺的船都平靜了。　　水，漸漸淹了墨老爺的全身；他機械地，下船動彈了一下，但是沉重得很，不像是浸在水裏那樣輕鬆。他再試着睜開眼睜，什麼也看不見，黑漆漆一團！而且他又直覺地嗅到一股汚膩的土腥氣味！接着是寒冷與風濕浸入了他的骨髓，以及他的心脾！　　他有些茫然，他不明白他現在到了什麼地方？他空間是活着呢？還是已經死了？道樣，不知道挨過了多畏時間，忽然從他的身上，跳出了一個小動物，而且在他的耳邊呌了幾聲淸脆的聲音，宛如一隻黄　鳥兒，轉瞬之間，牠就展翅飛走了　　　「打鬼：打鬼！我身上怎麼會飛出鳥兒來了？」　　墨老爺惶恐得像着了魔似的驚呌起來，然後，他無力地倒下去了，倒在汚泥裏！社會服務讀者當前的義務　為清寒學子籌集助金　　美國杜魯門總統向國人呼籲稱：「世界各國受災人民，今各以飢寒·貧困·疾病·為其勝利之代似者，數在三萬萬以上。爲使不及我人幸運者得分享我人之有餘，現正收集勝利衣，藉對萬能之上帝，使我人獲得勝利，表示感謝。」美總統之言，充分表現其關懷戰後盟國難民貧病流離的痛苦，他的目光，是顧到了全世界的難民，救濟範圍之廣，可見一斑。我人讀了這篇呼籲文，總有一番感想：當然目光，魄力，不敢與杜總統來比擬，但至少也該學習他樂善好施的精神，發揮同情的心理。我現在舉個例說：本報上屆助學金受助學生有二千四百餘人，都是成績優秀而家境淸寒的新靑年，下學期因學費大增，日夜徬徨，難免失學之苦！凡屬上海市民，以及本報無數讀者，出錢出力，爲他們籌措學習，實是義不容辭的責任。請自即日起，大家量力捐輸，多多愈善，那是急不容　的義舉。流民從新做人（上）  董炎　　參觀漕河涇收容所有感　　上海究免有多少流民乞丐？這問題沒有人能精確地解答。但假定說有一萬多，那麼漕河涇難民難童收容所便負担了全數的十分之一。他們收容了一千二百五六十人，而且每日在增加，包括」投與警局捕送。主持人有一個理想：希望有足够的屋宇和經費，把全市所有流民乞丐都收容起來，重新敎育他們，賦予生產的技能，使社會消失一批蛀虫，增加許多生產者。但是說也可憐，目前即此一處，也已感無法維持呢！　　雖然由善救總署供給了麵粉，但是還有燃料，被服，鞋襪，以及一切什用到那裏去取得呢？最少的估計，月需六百萬元，過去一切費用暫由社會局借墊，然而這終不是長久的辦法。已經戒絕嗜好重新做人的不能呌他再入歧途，生機活潑的孩童也不能讓他們永遠流落在街頭上乞討搶食。請諸君去看看該所的近狀，我相信你會解開同情之囊。　　該收容所佔地九十六畝，房屋三大幢，難民每十四人住一間，睡的是草墊，每天吃三餐麵條，要吃去十四包麵粉。許多瓦礫堆已墾爲良地，由難民親手種下蔬菜，還有一部份在做縫紉工作，搓好的草繩堆積如山，這些都是他們的生產。如果有工廠的機械設備，也許他們都是生產戰士，可以自給自足了。上海職業指導所　擴大職業指導運動　專業訓練及升學就業指導　　中華職業敎育社上海職業指導所，自復員以來，對於各項工作，進行相當順利。最近鑒於失業問題嚴重，更積極展開工作，擴大職業指導運動，喚起社會注意，着重專業訓練，及升學就業指導

<h3>Three-Person Committee's Second Meeting; Ceasefire Order to Be Issued Within Days</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco, 8th, Midnight Broadcast: After attending the Three-Person Committee meeting today, Marshall declared: "The ceasefire" order can be issued within the next few days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] After a three-hour meeting this morning, the Three-Person Committee failed to reach an agreement on issuing a "ceasefire" order and will hold a second meeting tonight. Although some people feel disappointed, participants seemed quite optimistic when the morning meeting ended at 1:00 AM. U.S. President's Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, chaired the meeting. He seemed to be in good spirits when he exited the meeting room, but he declined to make any comments except to inform the correspondents that they should not expect any public announcement today. Zhang Qun, the representative of the National Government, told Chinese reporters that he believed the government's "ceasefire" order would be issued before the first meeting of the Political Consultative Conference on January 10th. Communist representative Zhou Enlai told Chinese reporters that the Communist Party's "ceasefire" order might be issued "in two or three days." Today's second meeting will be held at 4:30 PM (Chongqing time, 5:30 PM Shanghai time). It is widely believed that the scope of discussion will include the following four key points: (1) the "ceasefire" formula; (2) the restoration of transportation; (3) the acceptance of the surrender of Japanese troops in the Communist-controlled areas; (4) the repatriation of Japanese troops to their home country. While the Three-Person Committee is studying these issues, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, one of the government representatives at the Political Consultative Conference, suggested that both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should simultaneously "cease fire" in the propaganda war and on the front lines. Wang stated that he believed that mutual attacks between the two parties would be detrimental to the negotiations. Lu Dingyi, Director of Propaganda for the Communist Party (and also a member of the Political Consultative Conference), agreed with this point at today's preparatory meeting of the Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<h3>Northeastern People Declare Their Opinions, Deeply Hope for Unification, Early Implementation of Constitutional Government; Various People's Organizations Receive Members of the Political Consultative Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Government representative Zhang Qun and Communist representative Zhou Enlai, together with Special Envoy Marshall, continued their discussions at 10:00 AM on the 8th. At 7:00 PM, Marshall accepted the invitation of Soviet Ambassador Petrov for a dinner at the Soviet Embassy on Pipashan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] The Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang Provinces Restoration Advancement Association, the Northeastern Construction Association, the Northeastern Righteous People Homecoming Committee, the Northeastern Refugee Relief Committee, and the Northeastern Vanguard Society, seven organizations in total, hosted members of the Political Consultative Conference at the Victory Building on the afternoon of the 8th. Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, representatives Zhang Zhenya, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, Chang Naide, Zhang Shenfu, Liang Shuming, Zhang Bojun, Wang Yunwu, Hu Lin, et al., Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Wang Ruofei, Ye Jianying, Wu Wangzhang, Lu Ding, Deng Yingchao, et al. could not attend due to matters of business, but Li Ji and Zong Dai attended as representatives. Wang Hansheng chaired the meeting. Wang immediately proposed six points regarding the current Northeastern issue on behalf of the 40 million compatriots in the nine provinces and two cities of the Northeast: (1) The Northeast should have the same administrative institutions as other provinces and cities in China. (2) Military power in the Northeast should be vested in the Central Government. (3) The Northeastern economy should be absolutely open, and the exploitation of resources should be especially open. (4) Oppose the specialization of the Northeast. He also stated that the Northeast had suffered terribly under enemy occupation for fourteen years and urgently hoped that the central government would send personnel to the Northeast to complete the handover work as soon as possible, and further hoped that the National Army would quickly go to the Northeast to take over defense and restore local order. During the meeting, Shao Lizi, Yu Jiaju, Wang Yunwu, Hu Lin, Liang Shuming, and others were invited to speak in turn. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Six organizations of Northeastern natives in Chongqing issued a written opinion on the current situation in the Northeast, stating: Since the September 18th Incident, our Northeastern people have been ravaged by the enemy for fourteen years. The suffering during that time is beyond words. We were celebrating the victory of the War of Resistance and expecting peace, but unexpectedly, the actual situation has taken a turn for the worse. Almost all areas of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Chahar are engulfed in flames of war, transportation is destroyed, factories are demolished, young and strong people are coerced, and the old and young fill the ravines. These unfortunate events are being reenacted in the Northeast, plunging our 40 million compatriots into deep waters. Now that the Political Consultative Conference is about to be convened, we stand on the position of the people and must declare the Northeastern people's views on the current situation in the Northeast: (1) The Northeast is a part of Chinese territory, and the people of the Northeast are one with the Chinese nation. There is no difference compared to the inland provinces. Recently, there have been talks of specialization. We solemnly declare that the handling of issues related to the Northeast should be the same as in other provinces. We firmly oppose all special measures. (2) If the Communist army violates the will of the people, it will be abandoned by the Northeastern people. (3) The people of the Northeast deeply hope that the country will be peacefully unified, that constitutional government will be implemented as soon as possible, and that democratic politics will be completed. (4) Our Northeastern people have suffered from the enemy's poison for fourteen years. After much painful reflection, we urgently hope that the government will complete the handover work as soon as possible, promptly establish popular representative bodies, and promote local autonomy as the foundation for constitutional government.</p>

Now that our government has been restored, we should effectively protect and treat these primary and secondary school teachers well. Among them, if there are very few bad elements who willingly colluded with the enemy and whose actions are clearly revealed, we should also ascertain the facts and handle them with caution, without any discrimination.

It is hoped that you will forward this order to the responsible military and local party and government personnel in the recovered areas for implementation.</p>

<h3>Student Unrest in Nanjing Resolved</h3>
<p>Students Who Caused Trouble Will Be Punished</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch, Nanjing, 8th] A group of students from the Nanjing Provisional University Preparatory Class who had previously studied at the Puppet Central University caused trouble on the 6th because they were dissatisfied with the English placement test and public expenses and dormitory issues, injuring the class director Wang Shulin.

The students of the class requested Mayor Ma to mediate and restore classes yesterday and today.

He urged them to apologize to Director Wang as soon as possible so that classes could be restored. Wang Shulin is still in the hospital. The society is mostly disappointed that the students who caused trouble did not appreciate the government's hard work in establishing the Provisional University Preparatory Class.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On the U.S. Cotton Loan</h3>
<p>The American cotton loan to China from the United States totals $33 million, enough to purchase 300,000 bales of American cotton, sufficient for one year's use in our country. Although all the details are still to be agreed upon, there should be no major changes. From this news, we should understand: (1) The textile industry, whether government-run or privately-run, although proceeding simultaneously, still has a large shortage of its main raw material, cotton. (2) It is necessary to purchase foreign cotton to compensate for the shortage, but there is a lack of foreign exchange. (3) When foreign businesses want to promote the sale of their goods in China, they must also provide loans at the same time. At the same time, it is reported that the Minsheng Company is purchasing ships from the United States, and the United States has also agreed to provide a loan of $15 million. In comparison, the true nature of this situation becomes even clearer.</p>
<p>Originally, it is said that China's unfrozen funds in the United States amount to only $350 million. This amount is not even enough to cover one year's payments for imports from the United States under normal circumstances. If there are no other sources to offset international receipts and payments, then it is equivalent to fighting with bare hands. No matter how urgent the need for foreign materials is, it is still something that can be hoped for but not attained.</p>
<p>At present, in the minds of most people, a large post-war loan seems inevitable. Moreover, President Truman has also clearly stated in his announced China policy that this matter can be discussed. Therefore, it seems that only seeking a sufficient import of goods is important, and other matters can be dealt with later. However, it is not known that the big loan is still just a pie in the sky at present, and it cannot be expected too much in the short term. The Americans also understand this very well, so they are addressing what is most urgent and first provide piecemeal solutions to cope with the current situation. Moreover, even if the large loan is secured, it will not be a long-term solution if there are no other sources to offset it. The foreign exchange rate that everyone is watching has not been announced to this day. Although there are many issues involved, the foreign exchange issue is undoubtedly one of them.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, it is actually very simple. From a superficial perspective, whether solving it as a whole or piecemeal, it ultimately comes down to borrowing. From a fundamental perspective, however, it is necessary to start with promoting export trade. China's foreign exchange funds, apart from remittances from overseas Chinese and foreign public and private funds, which account for a small part, mostly rely on export goods.</p>
<p>Some people believe that because foreign communication has been cut off for a long time, various countries have a great need for China's native products. As long as the foreign exchange and shipping problems can be solved, the future of the export business is very promising. This may be partly true. Why? Although the foreign appetite is very good, after the wars, there are scars everywhere, and the output of various native products is far less than before. For example, the silk industry in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas will inevitably feel unable to recover in the short term because too many mulberry fields have been destroyed. The same is true for other products such as tung oil and tea. Moreover, after the restoration, many areas in the interior have not fully restored their security, transportation, and finance. So, how can the production industry recover quickly?</p>
<p>Therefore, when talking about international trade, one cannot help but think of domestic trade: when talking about domestic trade, one cannot help but think of political issues. Any party, any class, if they believe that the interests of the country and the nation are above all else and are supreme, then they should abandon private prejudices and first quickly restore transportation, stabilize order, and then revive industry and increase foreign trade.</p>

<h3>Consul General Jiang Jiadong Stationed in Java Heads to Batavia to Assume Post. Our Military Officer Detained in Kuala Lumpur and Injured by British Troops; We Have Demanded Compensation, Punishment, Apology, etc.</h3>

In addition, Chen Jiageng has requested that the British authorities take effective steps to stop the anti-Chinese actions of Malaysians in Kuala Lumpur, northern Malaya.

The British side has accepted the first demand, and the other three demands will be answered tomorrow. Our military officer told reporters: Unless the four demands are fully complied with, our side will take legal action. At the same time, all the facts have been notified to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Kuala Lumpur branch of the Kuomintang, both of which have promised to convene a meeting of all local Chinese organizations to discuss countermeasures if the four demands are not fully answered. According to our military officer, the incident occurred on the afternoon of the 3rd. Our military liaison officer Zhang Wensen (transliteration), fully armed, parked his car outside the Lakes Hotel where they were staying. A British military officer and a Dutch military officer also drove a car. The British officer ordered our military officer to drive to the police station for no reason. Zhang refused and cut off the car's power supply, making it unable to move. The British officer ordered the Dutch officer to point a gun at Zhang, and he summoned more than 30 military police, 50 policemen, and some soldiers, who rushed towards a small number of our military officers, attempting to disarm our side. During the conflict, two of our military officers were seriously injured in the head by gun butts. The British military police surrounded the hotel rooms where our troops were staying, taking away guns, uniforms, watches, and fountain pens, and even money. At that time, British liaison officers Lieutenant Colonels Fening and Colbeck were both present, but failed to stop it. At the time of the incident, most of the 56 officers were out for dinner. Our officers are gathered here waiting for transportation back to the country. Since the Japanese surrender, they have been requesting to be sent back to the country, but they have not yet obtained transportation for some reason.</p>

<h3>The Problem of the Existence of the China-India Highway Has Not Yet Been Finally Decided; There Are Also Three Rumors About the Future of the Pipeline</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Kunming, 8th] The problem of the existence or abolition of the China-India Highway and the China-India Pipeline is a matter of great concern to the general public here, but so far there has been no final concrete decision. The Bomi Highway in the China-India Highway has in fact been abandoned, because the Bomi Highway has not reached the original standard, and after the victory of the War of Resistance, the existence of the road is not welcomed by a certain country. The Road Bureau once planned to use its own radio station in Myitkyina, but it was also prohibited by a certain party. This wartime highway built with the blood and sweat of Chinese and American people will become a historical name. As for the future of the China-India oil pipeline, there are three rumors here: (1) Dismantle and transfer all the equipment to the Gansu Oil Mine Bureau to install the pipeline. The most difficult part of this project is the transportation problem, followed by the lack of funds. It is estimated that it will require 100 million yuan. This was one of the initial plans of the China-India Oil Pipeline Engineering Office. Now, according to a senior official of the office, this matter may be difficult to achieve. (2) The China-India oil pipeline will be taken over by American businessmen. It is rumored that the Asia, Texaco, and Mobil Oil Companies are currently negotiating with our government in Chongqing. If it can be resolved quickly, it is expected that oil can be transported in February. (3) Continue to maintain the status quo, neither resuming oil transportation in the short term nor abandoning it, and wait for the decision of the Chinese and American governments. Director Guo is still in Chongqing, seeking instructions from relevant parties on the aftermath of the pipeline. The personnel of the Pipeline Engineering Office are still continuing to work. As of today, they have not received any orders to end or other orders.</p>

<h3>First Plenary Session of the United Nations General Assembly to Open in London Tomorrow; The Issue of Controlling Atomic Energy Will Be Discussed Thoroughly</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 8th broadcast: The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open on the morning of the 10th. The Soviet delegation arrived here today, but its leader Vyshinsky (Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister) will not arrive until tomorrow. British Foreign Secretary Bevin will host a banquet tonight to entertain the representatives of various countries. After arriving here, US Secretary of State Byrnes told reporters: The atomic bomb issue will be one of the central issues to be discussed at the General Assembly, but we must pay attention to the fact that the General Assembly will discuss its control methods, not its production methods.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] The plenary session of the United Nations organization is scheduled to be held here this Thursday. A ten-person working committee is currently engaged in the final preparations, organizing the agenda of the General Assembly. Half of the representatives of various countries have arrived in London by sea and air from all over the world. It is estimated that the total number of representatives from 51 countries will be more than 2,000.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] Foreign Minister Wang was originally scheduled to represent China at the United Nations General Assembly, but because the Political Consultative Conference will open on the 10th, he will not be able to go to London.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 8th] The US delegation to the United Nations General Assembly will discuss the stance to be taken on the atomic energy resolution after Byrnes arrives in London. It is said that Byrnes has been notified that some members of the US delegation believe that the resolution should be revised. If the US delegation cannot reach a consensus, it will cause a serious situation, but most officials are optimistic and believe that the issue can be resolved. Byrnes must have a clear plan for this issue and hopes to avoid an internal "crisis" in the United States.</p>
<h3>US Delegation Establishes Five-Person Committee; Atomic Energy Issue is Safeguarded</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] Before departing for London yesterday, the US Secretary of State issued a declaration guaranteeing that Congress will retain the final say on any action by the United States to transfer atomic energy knowledge to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. He also announced the establishment of a five-person committee, chaired by Deputy Secretary of State Acheson, with members including former Assistant Secretary of State McCloy, Dr. Bush, an expert on US supervision and development of atomic energy, Dr. Conant, and Major General Groves, to study the necessary controls and safeguards so that the American people can understand how the United Nations Commission will proceed when it begins its mission. Byrnes also said that the United Nations Commission is concerned not with how atomic energy is produced, but with how it can be controlled for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] After arriving in London, Secretary of State Byrnes will convene a meeting of the US delegation to the General Assembly to provide them with assurances on the issue of atomic energy control, just as he assured the country. Byrnes stated yesterday to the people at home and abroad: (1) The atomic energy commission to be organized in the future will not have the right to demand scientific information that the United States is unwilling to provide. (2) The United States may use its veto power to prevent the United Nations Security Council from attempting to obtain this information. (3) If the commission passes a resolution promoting the exchange of this information with the consent of the United States, the final decision on whether the United States participates rests with Congress.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 7th special telegram] The selection of US representatives to the main committees of the United Nations General Assembly has been announced: Conant will attend the First Committee on Political and Security Affairs, White will attend the Second Committee on Economic and Financial Affairs, Mrs. Roosevelt will attend the Third Committee on Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Affairs, Townsend will attend the Fourth Committee on Trusteeship Affairs, Dulles will attend the Fifth Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Affairs, and Vandenberg will attend the Sixth Committee on Legal Affairs.</p>
<h3>The Iranian Issue Will Not Be Placed on the Agenda; It Will Be Handled by a Three-Country Committee</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 8th] A State Department spokesman revealed yesterday: The Iranian Embassy in the United States informed Stettinius, the chief US representative to the United Nations General Assembly, that the Iranian government does not intend to place the Iranian-Soviet dispute on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly in order to continue its efforts to establish a three-country committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, 8th, London] The first issue facing the US delegation concerns the voting election of the President of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General, and the non-permanent members of the Security Council. It is widely believed that the US delegation supports a representative from an Eastern European country to serve as Secretary-General, most likely one of the three: Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, Dutch Kleffens, or Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie. If the Soviet Union insists that the post of Secretary-General must be held by a European, then the United States will support the nomination of Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk. If a stalemate develops between Eastern and Western European countries, the United States will propose Canadian Ambassador to the United States Pearson as a compromise. The United States' proposed non-permanent members of the Security Council include Brazil from South America and Mexico from Central America. It is expected that Egypt will win a seat representing Central Africa and East Africa, and Canada and Australia will represent the autonomous territories and the Far East.</p>

<h3>Our Representatives in the United States Inspect Highway System</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chicago, 8th] China hopes to build 300,000 li of new highways, the same as those in the United States. Three representatives from the China Highway Bureau are currently in the United States to inspect the highway system, traffic management, vehicle licensing, and methods to reduce accidents. These three are all graduates of Chongqing Jiaotong University and are working in the Highway Bureau. It is said that China hopes to obtain US$72 million from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to purchase 310,000 materials for road construction, and hopes to have 300,000 cars in five years, shuttling back and forth on the newly built highways. Wei, a world-renowned traffic expert from the US Safety Committee, is currently assisting the three representatives in studying traffic safety laws. One of the goals is to eliminate the threat of "city tigers." The so-called "city tiger" refers to drivers who drive recklessly. According to the conclusions of the Chinese delegation's inspection, Chinese car drivers need a licensing and driving record system. In addition, it is planned to educate tens of thousands of new drivers who use the highway, starting with publicity, notices, and radio broadcasts. During the inspection of American highways, the Chinese representatives discovered a safety device, namely reflective highway warning signs, which are indispensable on Chinese highways.</p>

<h3>At least Six Belligerent Members of the Japanese Cabinet Will Be Removed from Office; Third Meeting Held Yesterday, but Still No Result; Rumors that Shidehara Will Automatically Retire After the General Election</h3>
<p>[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 8th] The Japanese Cabinet convened its third meeting today regarding the issue of cabinet resignation, which will still be left to Shidehara's decision. However, the exact date of Shidehara's recovery and return to duty remains unknown. Some say that the government is deliberately employing delaying tactics to alleviate external pressure. Chief Cabinet Secretary Tsuda stated that no decision could be made until Shidehara returns to office. Yesterday, there were reports that Foreign Minister Yoshida would visit MacArthur for instructions, but this had not materialized by this afternoon. Allied officials believe that this matter should be resolved by the Japanese themselves to test whether they can make a constructive decision. It is now known that at least six members of the cabinet will be removed from office, but Shidehara still hopes to avoid the calamity of a general cabinet resignation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] According to today's news, Prime Minister Shidehara, acting on MacArthur's directive to purge all individuals in public office who had some connection with the military, is reportedly prepared to dismiss at least six cabinet members. However, if the cabinet decides to resign en masse, he has decided to recommend a successor for the position of prime minister. The initial panic caused by the issuance of the directive seems to have subsided. According to various sources, Shidehara intends to form some form of coalition government after dismissing the cabinet members named on the blacklist. The six cabinet members expected to be dismissed are: Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Kenzo Matsumura, Minister of Home Affairs Zennosuke Horikiri, Minister of State Daizaburo Tsuda, Minister of Education Maeda, Minister of Communications Yoshio Tanaka, and Minister of State Matsutani Haji. To fill these positions, it is reported that Shidehara is preparing to select candidates for ministers from various political parties and the public in order to form a new coalition government. During this transitional period, the government will prepare for the general election. Once the election is over, the government will automatically retire. Shidehara stated that if this fails, he will resign jointly with the cabinet. In addition, he will advise the Emperor on possible successors to set a precedent. Previously, the Emperor often consulted the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, who convened a meeting of the Elder Statesmen and the President of the Privy Council to determine the new prime minister. Now that the position of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal has been abolished, the Emperor may have to seek the advice of the resigning prime minister, who, after holding a meeting with the President of the Privy Council and the speakers of both houses of parliament, will then recommend another candidate. Another complicated matter is that after deciding on a candidate, the Emperor must submit the list to the Allied Headquarters. If the latter does not approve, new candidates must be sought. Some observers believe that Shidehara's decision on the issue of a successor shows that he is not ignoring the great possibility of a general cabinet resignation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch] The opinion that the Shidehara Cabinet should resign en masse is now gaining momentum. The cabinet ministers (excluding the ailing Prime Minister Shidehara) met again this morning to discuss MacArthur's purge directive. During informal exchanges of views, most cabinet ministers expressed that if MacArthur's directive is faithfully implemented, the cabinet will undergo a large-scale reorganization. This is virtually equivalent to forming a new government.</p>
<p>Purging Belligerent Elements Requires Considerable Time</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 8th] The major items discussed in today's cabinet meeting included two edicts that were provisionally approved yesterday, formally announcing MacArthur's directives, one banning right-wing groups and the other prohibiting ultranationalists from holding public office. Tsuda also stated that these directives are extremely difficult to implement and will require a considerable amount of time. Since MacArthur Headquarters has not specified a deadline, this point should be approved. Simply investigating the activities of government officials during the war to determine whether they supported militarism will take two or three months to collect reports. Therefore, key officials will be dismissed first, followed by secondary bureaucrats. The government plans to issue certificates to those who are impartial and clean in the upcoming election and can participate in the election. Generally speaking, due to the large number of people, the government will individually identify them after they announce their candidacy to see if they are qualified. The text of the directive has been published so that candidates can "judge themselves" in advance, he said.</p>
<h3>British Scientist Claims Soviet Union Invented New Atomic Bomb, Making British and American Atomic Bombs Pale in Comparison</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, Terri 8th] British scientist Dr. Anberto announced today that the Soviet Union has invented a new type of atomic bomb, and British and American atomic bombs pale in comparison. The Soviet atomic bomb can also be produced on a large scale. Its shape is about the size of a tennis ball, and its explosive force can reach 56 miles horizontally and 6.2 miles vertically. The heat emitted can reach millions of degrees Celsius. The destructive power of British and American atomic bombs is determined by oil atoms, while the Soviet atomic bomb generates power through rotation or angular movement, which is more suitable for engineering applications.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Atomic bomb experts here today were unwilling to directly criticize Dr. Anberto's claim that the Soviet Union had invented the latest atomic bomb, only saying that according to recent evidence, even if other countries obtained the knowledge of atomic energy currently possessed by the United States and then manufactured atomic bombs, it would take years to succeed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 8th] British scientist Anberto Chuanshi claimed that the Soviet Union has invented a new type of atomic bomb, making British and American atomic bombs pale in comparison. According to a criticism in the New York Forum News by Dr. Weskopf, an atomic bomb expert at Cambridge University, the claim that the Soviet Union invented this bomb is absurd, because it is absolutely impossible to generate a large amount of heat from a small amount of uranium.</p>
<h3>Tomoyuki Yamashita Requests Trial in Civilian Court, Prosecutor Opposes Retrial</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th Dispatch] Tomoyuki Yamashita, who was sentenced to death by hanging, today asked the U.S. Supreme Court to transfer the case to a civil court for trial. Yamashita's lawyers have submitted to the Supreme Court a request stating that his troops did not commit any criminal acts. Yamashita's defense lawyers claim that this convicted war criminal has the same legal rights as all human beings under the control of U.S. government agencies. However, the government prosecutor refuted Yamashita's attempt to have the Supreme Court hear the case, stating that Yamashita could not enjoy the right to be tried by a U.S. court during wartime and still insisted that the U.S. military commission had the power to try Yamashita for violating the laws of war. The legal question raised by this case is whether the power of military tribunals ceases with the cessation of war or the end of the war. Yamashita's defense lawyers expressed regret over the U.S. military commission's claim that Yamashita's case could be tried by a military tribunal or an international tribunal. The government prosecutor announced that if war criminals were tried by civil courts, it could ultimately lose its judicial function. According to the U.S. government, the debate will end tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Students Cause Trouble at the Capital Temporary University, Head Teacher Wang Shulin Injured, Ministry of Education Decides to Deal with it Severely</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Special Report] The temporary training class of the University run by the Ministry of Education in Beijing has more than 2,000 students. Among them, some students, that is, more than 200 students who previously studied at the fake Central University, because the class held a grading test:</p>
<p>Students Request Public Disclosure of Test Papers</p>
<p>When the English course, which was proctored by female English professor Yu Da, was completed, they demanded that all the test papers be made public. The school believed that since the assessment of grades was the responsibility of the professor and there was an administrative system, it was not appropriate to comply with the students' requests in everything. Unexpectedly, more than 200 of the students in the class, the so-called 121 Student Association (students of the fake Central University who reorganized the student association on December 1), surrounded Director Wang Shulin in the class at around 10 am on the 6th of this month, demanding that the test papers be made public but failing.</p>
<p>Skull Smashes Director's Glasses</p>
<p>They smashed the skull in the specimen room, broke Wang's glasses, injured his left eye, broke the skin and caused bleeding, punched him in the waist, and surrounded him to petition the Ministry of Education. It happened to be Sunday, and the Ministry of Education was not working.

The Executive Yuan recently formulated the "Revised Regulations on Compulsory Education", which ordered the implementation of the national system. It stipulates that each township shall establish a "Township Compulsory Education Committee", which shall be organized by the township chief, the head of the cultural section of the township office, the principals of the township central national school and national schools, and representatives of the township citizens, with the township chief as the director.

<h3>Education Loan Committee Calls for Enthusiastic Donations</h3>
<p>[Our City News] The person in charge of the Shanghai Education Loan Committee said: The Loan Committee launched teachers and students from various schools to help solicit donations, mainly to encourage students to help themselves and others, and has repeatedly notified that donations should only be solicited from parents and relatives. However, people from all walks of life seem to lack a deep understanding of the importance of helping students who have dropped out of school, so the number of people who automatically donate is very small. Before the start of the donation, the committee had submitted it to the competent authority for record. The donation books held by each student are printed and distributed by each school, and it is stipulated that the principals of each school should check the fees against the books, collect them and submit them to the bank designated by the committee. The donors have donation receipts from the school, and their titles have been reported to the committee by the school, and the committee distributes the National News Two radio stations for broadcasting to show their trust. At present, at least 10,000 young people in the city urgently need tuition subsidies (the students subsidized this semester are based on the Xin Xin Er Bao, reaching more than 7,000 people, and the number of people who are subsidized by various groups and hold Xiangyu must be considerable). In the next semester, the tuition fees of various private schools average 15,000 yuan per student. To subsidize 10,000 young people, it is necessary to raise 150 million yuan in legal tender. The initial goal of the committee to raise donations was 100 million yuan, but so far, the amount obtained is less than 15 million yuan, which is far from the goal. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will rise up to sponsor, so that outstanding young people in Qinghan and poor teachers in the city will benefit from it.</p>

<p>South China used Li Xianzheng, He Jingui, and Li Ruixiong as forwards, and the Liu brothers Fushan and Fuqiang as guards, which seemed to be the team's most ideal lineup. The Transportation Team's players were all tall and powerful, but South China's soldiers were active and coordinated well. The Transportation Team's skills had not yet reached their peak. Among them, Ponatti's defender had very good skills, but lacked partners. In the first half, South China led 20 to 11. After the change of sides, the South China Five continued to play, and the Transportation Team changed three people. South China's momentum was still strong, and the players who were transferred to the Transportation Team were not as good as the previous three. In comparison, South China was bound to win. In the last eight minutes, the US military planned to make a desperate move and gradually became rude, which resulted in fouls. South China used a fast attacking method. In the end, South China won 39 to 26.</p>

<h3>Negotiations on Korean Nationals' Evacuation in Progress</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Shanghai Office of the Korean Restoration Army regarding the rumor that Korean nationals in China were preparing to return to their country. The answer was as follows: As of now, there are more than 7,000 Korean military and civilians in this city. These include over 5,000 civilians and over 1,000 soldiers. Some evacuated from Yichang, Changsha, Hankou, and other places, and some came from Chongqing and other anti-Japanese war zones. Negotiations regarding the evacuation of Korean nationals are currently being conducted by MacArthur Headquarters and the Chinese government. However, due to a lack of ships, it will inevitably not be done until after one or two months. The disputes over the property and houses of Koreans in this city are also not easy to resolve. China and Korea are brotherly countries. We hope that China will provide assistance on how to make the people of China and Korea live in harmony. Recently, the General Relief Administration transported relief supplies to Shanghai, and this office has also been allocated flour, old clothes, and other items.</p>

<h3>Our Military and Police Authorities Monitor the French Consulate General</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Chen Guolian, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, recently told reporters that the local negotiations regarding the "Beradin" ship illegally transporting war criminals out of the country have come to an end. The case has been transferred to Chongqing for handling. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also lodged a strong protest with France and demanded that France fulfill certain conditions. If the French response is not satisfactory to China, China will take appropriate action. The current task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office is to execute the instructions after receiving orders from the ministry. Chen then solemnly stated that the incident itself is a political issue, while such behavior is a legal issue. This is the first major event after China's victory. In order to maintain the independence and integrity of sovereignty, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will not easily let it go. Chen firmly believes that China will be able to achieve a victory of fairness and justice in this negotiation. The reporter then asked Chen how the legal responsibility of the captain of the ship would be handled, given that the Beradin left Shanghai five days ago and may have already arrived in Saigon. Chen replied that China still has the right to make demands.</p>
<p>Also, the reporter heard that senior officials from the Foreign Affairs Section of the Songhu Garrison Command visited Chen yesterday afternoon to discuss matters. According to reliable sources, our military and police authorities have been closely monitoring the French Consulate General, the Consul General's residence, and the French barracks in this city since the afternoon of the 6th to prevent unexpected incidents.</p>
<p>France to Request International Study</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 7th] A government spokesman announced today: France will submit the issue of extraterritoriality in China to the United Nations General Assembly in London for discussion. Chinese officials protested three days ago that the French Consul in Shanghai had arbitrarily arrested the French National Socialist Karkopino and transferred him to a French warship, claiming that it was an infringement of Chinese sovereignty. The French view is that France still retains extraterritoriality in China until a new treaty is signed between China and France, and officially supports the position of Fei Zongxi, the French Consul General in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>High Court Criminal Division to Continue Hearing Traitor Cases Today</h3>

<h3>Iron Gates in the Min'guo Road Area Being Removed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The iron fences in the former French Concession and the Min'guo Road area have been removed by the Municipal Public Works Bureau to facilitate traffic between Nanshi and Huangpu District and will be completed in a short time. Wei'ning Road in western Shanghai and Jiaotong Road in the central district have been covered with cinder. Other renovation and road maintenance projects are still ongoing. At the same time, a total of more than 9,000 square meters of sidewalks have been repaired and completed. More than 7,800 city drainage inlets that have been silted up for a long time have also been dredged by the bureau.</p>
<p>Traffic Control and Painting of Markings</p>
<p>Regarding traffic control, in addition to painting "keep to the right" and parking signs at the corners of various intersections, the traffic separation line on Zhongzheng Road is also being painted from east to west. In addition to the reconstruction of 18 tram stops, many other tram stops have been painted white to make them easier for passengers to identify. The bureau has rushed to produce approximately 900 new street nameplates, and the first batch of 300 has been installed, while the remaining 600 are being rushed to install.</p>
<p>Unified Colors for Various Vehicles</p>
<p>In order to improve the appearance of the city, the municipal government has decided to unify the colors of various vehicles in the city. After a meeting of the Public Utilities Bureau, it was decided to divide them into seven categories: buses, private cars, trams, tricycles, rickshaws, and bicycles. Each category will be assigned a separate color. However, given the huge cost of painting, a very wide deadline has been set.</p>
<p>Rickshaws Still Under Consideration</p>
<p>Regarding the abolition of rickshaws, Gu Guoshu, the Public Utilities Bureau, Zhen Bai, told reporters yesterday: Rickshaws are the most common means of transportation in this city. Before other means of transportation replace them, the citizens will feel extremely inconvenienced if they are abolished. So far, the city government has not received any official documents regarding the abolition of rickshaws. He also said that the bureau is currently planning to inspect licensed rickshaws and tricycles one by one. Those that are excessively old, have missing parts, or are dirty will not be allowed to continue operating.</p>
<h3>Six US Generals Awarded Medals Yesterday; Mayor Qian Presided and Presented on Behalf of the Chairman</h3>
<p>The National Government Chairman Jiang awarded the Order of Precious Tripod to US Brigadier General Calaway, the Special Rosette Order of Precious Tripod to Colonel Koe, the Rosette Order of Precious Tripod to Major MacFee, the Rosette Order of Yunhui to Major Graftdon, the Rosette Order of Precious Tripod to Captain Wu Hanmin, and the Rosette Order of Yunhui to Lieutenant Boyer. The awarding ceremony was held at the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM yesterday, with Shanghai Mayor Qian Dajun presiding and presenting on behalf of the Chairman. Brigadier General Calaway, Major MacFee, and Lieutenant Boyer personally came to the Municipal Government to receive the awards. Colonel Koe went to Chongqing on official business, and Major Graftdon and Captain Wu Hanmin returned to their home country on official business, so Major MacFee accepted the awards on their behalf. Mayor Qian first delivered a speech and then personally presented the medals one by one.</p>
<h3>Chennault's Statement: China Should Refine Its Air Force; Mission to China to Be Decided After Meeting Chairman</h3>
<p>Regarding the rumors that General Chennault came to China to train the air force, he issued a statement saying: Everything has not yet been decided. He came to China in a private capacity, but still retains the rank of Air Force Major General. Chen hinted in his remarks that his work could be officially announced after he meets with Chairman Jiang. However, Chen talked freely about the fact that today, China needs an air force that is refined and can be used in wartime and peacetime, focusing on quality rather than quantity. At the same time, the development of China's aviation industry is also extremely important. More factories should be established to manufacture aircraft so that the development of the aviation industry does not rely on foreign supply. From this point of view, it is generally believed that Chen's visit is inextricably linked to training the air force or helping us develop the aviation industry. Chen said that the members of the Flying Tigers of the past are now working in various jobs in the United States, and they have formed the Flying Tigers Airlines. When Chen first formed the Flying Tigers, there were only 300 members. By the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the staff of the 14th Air Force had increased to 23,000.</p>

<p>China and the U.S. Sign Agreement to Purchase Surplus U.S. Materials</p>
<p>U.S. Military Headquarters Officially Announces</p>
<p>U.S. Military Headquarters announced yesterday that China and the U.S. have signed an agreement for China to purchase U.S. surplus materials in China and all U.S. equipment remaining in western China for US$25 million and 6.16 billion in national currency. Once all materials are transferred, several hundred U.S. military personnel in the interior can leave China. The agreement was signed on November 29th of last year by President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, and U.S. Military Headquarters.</p>
<p>The surplus materials include thirteen major categories, ranging from small items like soldiers' weapons and supplies to large items like construction and airport equipment. The Chinese government has already paid US$5 million in advance, with the remaining US$20 million to be paid in 30 years.</p>
<p>As for the 6.16 billion in national currency, it will offset the 150 billion yuan that the Chinese government advanced for various uses by the U.S. military during the war. The remaining balance will be paid in installments over 30 years, with an annual interest rate of 2% to 3%. The U.S. military also stated that the original value of the items was US$67,264,000 and 5.16 billion in national currency.</p>

<p>Lee Ze's Accusation: Labor and Management Hold Conflicting Views</p>
<p>Mayor Qian States Impartial Handling</p>
<p>Following the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office interrogation and remand, Mayor Qian released a statement yesterday regarding the accusation against Lee Ze. The Xin Xin Company employees and company authorities hold differing opinions. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor Qian Stresses Importance of Public Security</p>
<p>Mayor Qian addressed the case of the Xin Xin Company employees' accusation against the company's General Manager, Lee Ze. The Police Bureau summoned Lee Ze for investigation, but he repeatedly failed to appear. Therefore, he was arrested at noon on the 7th, on suspicion of being a traitor and has been transferred to judicial authorities for investigation. However, the company's employees posted slogans all over Nanjing Road yesterday morning, causing pedestrians to stop and obstructing traffic. Such behavior is not a legitimate procedure for accusing traitors and is tantamount to an overstepping action that obstructs public security and disrupts social order. This government, in order to maintain public security, has ordered the Social Affairs and Police Bureaus to thoroughly investigate. If there is any malicious false accusation or coercion of the public, it will be suppressed to deter others and maintain public security. People should follow proper procedures to accuse traitors and must not engage in coercion.</p>
<p>Garrison Headquarters Disposes Impartially</p>
<p>After Lee Ze was arrested on suspicion of treason, the Xin Xin Company Board of Directors appointed Xiao Zongjing as acting general manager. Yesterday afternoon, the Garrison Headquarters Investigation Office invited Xiao to the Garrison Headquarters to inquire about the internal situation of the company. Subsequently, Inspector Bi Gaokui went to the Xin Xin Company Employees' Club on Guizhou Road to speak with employee representatives Shu Yueqiao and Yao Zhuoren, instructing them to provide as much evidence as possible of Lee Ze's collaboration with the enemy. The Garrison Headquarters will handle the matter impartially. However, this is Lee Ze's personal problem, and it has come to an end with his arrest. It is hoped that the employees' actions will not affect social order. According to the employees, the statement issued by the Board of Directors yesterday stating "labor-management misunderstanding" does not correspond to the facts, so they have requested the Board of Directors to correct it.</p>
<p>Higher Court Interrogation Leads to Remand</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The case of Lee Ze, General Manager of Xin Xin Company, which has caused a citywide sensation in recent days, was sent to the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office by the Police Bureau on the previous day. At 5:30 PM that afternoon, Judge Cao Jun opened an investigation court to interrogate him, inquiring in detail about his age, origin, address, occupation, etc. Lee admitted that he had served as a director of the puppet Merchants' Association, but denied all other allegations. Due to time constraints, the plaintiff was not summoned to court and was remanded for a later hearing. As this case is the first formal accusation of a traitor by the people, this reporter interviewed representatives of both labor and management of the company yesterday. The details are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Employees Express No Grudges</p>
<p>The employee representatives, Han Wucheng and others, stated that the case was initially filed by Shu Yueqiao, a former colleague, alone. Because no action was taken for a long time, 800 colleagues collectively reported the matter. Now that Lee Ze has been arrested, the reporting task has come to an end. In the future, a legal advisor will be hired to formally file an appeal. They hope that all sectors will give sympathetic attention and assistance. The employees' actions are purely from the standpoint of the people, not for personal grudges. Therefore, they hope that the government will immediately publicly try Lee Ze and monitor the transfer of his assets. They will refute the statements in the Board of Directors' announcement point by point.</p>
<p>The Company Believes It's About Treatment</p>
<p>A senior official of the company told the reporter that this incident was truly unfortunate for the company. Shu Yueqiao was originally an elevator operator at the New Capital Hotel. Because of his prudence and diligence, he was transferred to the hotel as a waiter. Later, due to a trivial matter, he attacked Lee Ze and was fired from the hotel. Later, he requested reinstatement from the company but was not granted, resulting in this accusation and the street parade. This further aroused the response of all colleagues. The company believes that the main reason why the employees sympathize with Shu Yueqiao is that the company has not given sufficient consideration to their welfare. In addition, the company's colleagues' association originally scheduled to perform a drama on New Year's Day and planned to sell tickets to the outside world to replenish the association's funds. The company believed that this move was tantamount to telling people that the company's treatment was too meager, and considering other industry counterparts, it ordered them to stop the performance. Now that things have come to this point, the right and wrong of Lee Ze should be judged by the national law, which can be set aside for now. As for the internal disputes of the company, it is hoped that they will be resolved peacefully, and the state of opposition will be stopped immediately. The company will not pursue those who initiated this case. The company has already planned to improve the treatment. Currently, the salary of the lowest-level employee is 8,600 yuan per month including meals, which makes it difficult to support a family. In short, it is hoped that private incidents will not be expanded into a confrontation between groups.</p>
<p>Sincere Employees Express Sympathy</p>
<p>[Ta Kung Pao News] The case of the Xin Xin Company employees' accusation against Lee Ze has aroused deep attention from all quarters. Yesterday, all Sincere employees also responded and issued a statement signed by more than 600 people, including Dai Litang from the Southern Goods Department, Cai Minzhong from the Cosmetics and Medicine Department, Sun Weizhen from Sincere Amusement Park, Gao Yuequn from the Piece Goods and Western Clothing Department, Ding Haoran from the Accounting Department, Zhang Xiaohong from the Hardware Department, and Liang Difen from the Leather Goods and Furniture Department. The statement briefly stated that the Xin Xin Company employees' accusation against Lee Ze aroused the sympathy of all our employees. It is hoped that the authorities will take decisive action to deal with it.</p>
<p>Private Shipping Industry Appeals for Compensation for Damages</p>
<p>The Wartime Losses Compensation Committee for Private Shipping Vessels has begun operating at 93 Guangdong Road in the Shipowners' Association, and has submitted requests for record-keeping to relevant agencies. The committee is investigating figures and preparing statistics. It is reported that the association will fill out loss survey forms for each member, prepare statistical tables according to four categories, and prepare a compensation plan. The association will send Standing Committee member Zhong Shandao to Chongqing to appeal to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Communications, Military Affairs Commission, and Rear Service Headquarters, and other relevant agencies, requesting prompt approval of compensation.</p>
<p>French Concession Water and Electricity Meter Maintenance Fees</p>
<p>Public Utilities Bureau Notifies Cancellation</p>
<p>The French Tramway and Electric Lighting Company has been collecting water and electricity meter maintenance fees from users since September of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, and has not yet cancelled it. Recently, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, in view of the fact that water and electricity prices have been comprehensively adjusted, other incidental expenses should be standardized as much as possible to ensure fairness. The bureau has notified the company to stop collecting the above water and electricity meter maintenance fees from January 1st of this year.</p>
<p>Business Tax Exemption for Three Months in Severely War-Torn Recovered Areas</p>

<p>U.S. Dollar Follows Gold Market's Fluctuations</p>
<p>Precious Metal Prices Continue to Rise by 15,000</p>
<p>Stock Market Conditions Generally Stable</p>
<p>Precious metal prices continued to rise yesterday, with a temporary dip in the middle of the day, but ultimately remained firm. Market sentiment was highly uncertain, with major players having differing views on supply and demand. However, actual sales at silver shops were particularly active. General psychology still leaned towards rising prices. The market opened in the morning carrying over the momentum from the previous day, rising to 855,000. Retail investors sold stocks to buy gold, gradually pushing the price up to 867,000. Major players took advantage of the high price to sell, hindering the rise and leading to a consolidation. At noon, many bulls closed their positions, causing the price to fall to 845,000. In the afternoon, stocks and bonds suddenly rose sharply. Retail investors chased purchases at low prices, and silver shops frequently absorbed the supply. Major players pulled up the price from the side. Although transactions were limited, the lack of supply pushed the price up to 875,000, after which it began to hover. As a result, the closing price was 15,000 higher than the previous close. Gold jewelry in silver shops was listed at 93,000, and silver ingots also rose to 700 yuan. Silver dollars hovered around 450 yuan, and unofficial lending rates remained extremely stable, with interest rates fixed at around 10%.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar continued to follow the gold market's fluctuations, lacking special stimuli. The trend remained unusually firm, with considerable uncertainty in the middle of the day. However, the trading range was narrow. The market opened at 1,460 yuan in the morning, and retreated from 1,470 yuan to 1,445 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, stimulated by the gold price, the market closed at a higher price, rising 20 yuan compared with the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar was stable.</p>
<p>Government bonds were initially flat and then stabilized. In the end, the market closed at a high price due to deliberate manipulation by insiders, but it was too late, and the high closing price was entirely due to the actions of market makers, with no special changes. As a result, mature issues were firm compared to the previous close, while miscellaneous issues failed to keep up. Class A and B bonds were flat, Class C bonds rose 60 yuan, Class D bonds rose 10 yuan, and Class E bonds rose 30 yuan.</p>
<p>There were differing views on supply and demand for Chinese stocks, and major players entered and exited the market in different ways. However, compared to each other, there were more sellers than buyers, so the market was quite hesitant in the middle of the day. However, at noon, surplus capital from profits in foreign stocks came to absorb Xinyi Yarn Factory, affecting other stocks. Securities firms, with this help and feeling that the gold market was lackluster, came to pull up the price again. As a result, the noon close once again reached a high point. The shouting price continued to rise in the afternoon. Compared with the previous close, Yongxin Yarn was up 85 yuan, Meiya was up 15 yuan, and the three small mature issues of Jingfu, etc., had slight ups and downs. This was because major players were focused on Xinyi and Yongxin yarn, and had no time to take care of smaller stocks. Other unpopular issues were less impressive due to lack of time. The shouting price continued to rise in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were less impressive due to insiders taking profits. However, as surplus capital from profits in Chinese stocks poured into foreign stocks, Yisha turned from fatigue to stability. Other small and unpopular issues failed to follow the recovery. As a result, Yisha rose 10 yuan compared to the previous close, Yihua Brewery fell 50 yuan, Paper Industry fell 40 yuan, and other stocks recovered by about half.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Begin to Fall</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Company Sells Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was volatile. The market opened at the highest price in the morning, then gradually declined and closed at a low price. Buyers were waiting and watching, and the trading volume was not large. The demand for fine yarn was particularly scarce. Each count of yarn fell by about 10% compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Rumors circulated in the market that the authorities would sell a large amount of yarn produced by the enemy-owned yarn factories that had been taken over, and that the price of Hong Kong yarn was falling, so buyers were hesitant and prices fell.</p>
<p>In addition, the China Textile Construction Company began selling yarn and cloth on the 7th to regulate civilian needs and suppress market prices. It offered 300 bales of yarn, with the price of 42-count blue phoenix double-strand yarn at 1.38 million per bale, 32-count yarn at 1.1 million, and 20-count yarn at 750,000. The spot yarn market initially carried over the high opening price from the previous day, and the transaction was flat. Later, when it was learned that the China Textile Construction Company had opened for sale, market sentiment weakened, and market prices fell. 42-count yarn fell by a small 100,000, and 20-count yarn fell by a small 60,000. Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company continued to offer more than 10,000 pieces of cotton cloth and about 200 bales of cotton yarn, with prices similar to the previous day. However, the company only sold to printing and dyeing factories and the yarn and cloth industry. The cotton cloth was sold by printing and dyeing factories such as Xinfu, Changxing, and Risheng, as well as cloth shops such as Zhaotai. The cotton yarn was sold separately by yarn shops such as Chengyu, Changzhen, Dachang, and Yifeng.</p>
<p>Silk and Satin Continue to be Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was volatile. The opening price of rayon was 940,000 yuan for the 120th Sky Bridge. Then it returned to 915,000 yuan. Later, there was news that the Tongfa warehouse receipt could be shipped within one or two days. For a time, market sentiment weakened and the market fell sharply. The closing price was 890,000 yuan. The warehouse receipt was 700,000 yuan, which was 450,000 yuan higher than the spot price on the previous day. Because export merchants had no formal transactions, and manufacturers and users believed that the finished products did not match the raw materials, there was a lot of wait-and-see attitude. Transactions were scarce and the price was similar to the previous day. As raw materials rose sharply, the price of silk goods rose. Meiya quilt covers were traded at 610,000 per 100 pieces. Later, as the silk market declined, it fell back slightly by 10,000 yuan. The price of Minsheng brocade was slightly higher than the previous day, at 9,000 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>Grain Prices are Firm</p>
<p>Oil, Bean Flour, and Bean Cake All Rise</p>
<p>The digestion of rice and grain on this street remains flat. Early in the morning, it was said that the Qingdao route of the northern merchants was moving but not prosperous. The customers were firm in their prices due to the high prices in various producing areas, and the market price rose slightly by more than 100 yuan. The white yuan market was fixed. The oil market continued to rise by more than 2,000 yuan due to the heavy demand from Ningbo merchants. The price of yellow soybeans from Fujian and Taiwan was high and getting higher, increasing by 200 to 300 yuan. The flour from Fujian merchants and the Zhoushan Islands continued to be loaded, and the price rose by more than 200 yuan again. The price of raw peanuts from foreign firms was very high, and sesame seeds were firm. Soybean cake continued to be shipped from Southeast Asia, and the market looked up by 100 yuan. The government's low-priced oil has been shipped, and sales will begin tomorrow. The retail price has not changed.</p>
<p>Metal Nails Sell Well</p>
<p>Metal nails have always been a popular item in the large hardware market. Recently, this has become even more pronounced. Because merchants from all over the country are purchasing hardware, they are all targeting this item, so prices are rising day by day. Currently, 1-inch nails are sold for 34,000 yuan, 1.5-inch nails are sold for 28,000 yuan, and 2-inch to 3-inch nails are sold for around 22,000 yuan.</p>
<p>British Reduce White Paper Prices</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] The British Ministry of Supply has issued an order to reduce the maximum price of white paper by 55 shillings per ton.</p>
<p>Tianjin Merchants Absorb Green Tea</p>
<p>The bulk of black tea is traditionally sold to Guangdong merchants, but since the route has become difficult, trading has been stagnant for a long time. Now that the rivers and mountains have been restored, there is a sign of recovery. As for green tea such as fried green and baked green, merchants in Tianjin are also in great demand. Therefore, they have started to absorb large quantities in recent days. The market entered a total of 270 to 280 dan yesterday. In terms of price, each dan has been increased by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, stores on this street are still frequently replenishing their stocks, and more than 100 dan have already been prepared, and the trend is following suit.</p>
<p>Commercial News Briefs</p>
<p>Recently, Carnation milk powder is not as abundant in the market as before. This is because domestic milk powder factories and fresh milk companies have been severely affected, so they have purchased a large amount. In addition, many merchants are transporting it to the interior.</p>
<p>The supply of white plain fine cloth for gambling is not smooth. Although products from Changzhou and Wuxi are transported to Shanghai for regulation, the quality is inferior and does not meet the dyeing needs of dyeing and weaving factories in this city. Therefore, once merchants purchase it, it becomes scarce.</p>
<p>Although there are many arrivals of sugar, merchants are bullish on the market and hold on to their goods. Sales are very strong due to the relationship with the New Year's season. There is a shortage of high-end rock sugar on the market, and prices are gradually rising.</p>
<p>There are still many actual sales of Western medicines, and with the frequent rise in gold prices, the market is strong and unstoppable.</p>
<p>Among canned foods, canned anchovies are the most popular. Merchants in Chongqing have a strong demand for it. Other canned foods are still flat.</p>
<p>The price of wool yarn is rising due to merchant purchases. Crane brand is 12,000 yuan, and miscellaneous brand wool yarn is 9,000 to 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Although yarn prices fell slightly yesterday compared to the previous day, the prices of many knitted products are still rising due to the continued rise in gold prices.</p>
<p>Cosmetics have been rising in recent days due to merchant activity, especially soaps. Zong sandalwood soap has jumped to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth Factories Eagerly Await the Return of Confiscated Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>The Yarn Industry Association, Cotton Cloth Industry Association, and Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association of this city recently submitted a joint request to the Executive Yuan, the Commissioner of Comfort, the Inspector, and the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration for the return of the remaining amount of yarn and cloth forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppets, which was transferred by the puppet Merchants' Association to the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration. Thousands of yarn and cloth factories in the city are closely watching the development of this event. It has been learned that the legal grounds held by the association are as follows: (1) According to the provisions of Articles 92 and 290 of the Civil Code, the purchase of yarn and cloth is an act of coercion and should be invalid. That is, in accordance with the principle of handling the additional second item, the enemy and puppets forcibly bought factories. Victims may apply for recovery, and the enemy and puppets forcibly bought yarn and cloth. According to the Cairo Declaration, the right to declare invalid the transfer or transaction of property or rights in enemy-occupied areas is reserved. (2) The people originally had no obligation to abide by the laws of the enemy and puppets. The purchase of yarn and cloth by the enemy and puppets was an illegal plunder, which clearly infringes upon the basic rights and interests of the people. Articles 16 and 17 of the Provisional Law of the Training Period of the Republic of China clearly stipulate the property rights of the people. (3) Articles 767 and 949 of the Civil Law of China also have clear provisions for the protection of property rights. (4) In international law, there are two types of enemy property: state-owned and privately owned. If it belongs to the state and is movable property that can be used for war, confiscation is the principle. If it is not used for war, it cannot be confiscated. If it is private, both movable and immovable property should be respected. According to Article 53, Paragraph 2 of the Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, weapons that belong to purely private individuals may be seized when necessary, and must be returned when peace is restored and their losses compensated. (5) In terms of international law, the law of the place where the property is located is the principle. The remaining yarn and cloth is still in the country. According to Chinese law, the defendant may assert his rights.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the association, the dispute over enemy property is a serious problem at present, and in fact it does not belong to the property of the enemy and puppets. In recent times, people have been arguing that the government will have fair and reasonable measures. The dyeing, weaving, and yarn industries have suffered the most widespread and deepest damage. The total price was 3,624,154,452 yuan and 58 cents.</p>

<p>The Girl with the Last Perm in Spring and Autumn by L莽莽</p>
<p>I came to this city of perms, and everywhere I encountered girls with permed hair; those thin faces became thinner; those fat faces became fatter; those young ones looked older, and those middle-aged ones looked even more weary. Yellow skin surrounded by curly hair is no more beautiful than white skin; yet all I encountered were girls with permed hair!</p>
<p>In a secluded place, there was a girl in plain clothes who alone maintained a natural demeanor. Black hair hung straight down by her ears, by her neck; neat, beautiful, maintaining an oriental charm.</p>
<p>I was lost in thought, I stared at her. Indeed, her pure black hair and dark eyes complemented each other! So I was gratified, I was pleased that there were still girls in this city who did not perm their hair.</p>
<p>I walked past her door several times, I admired her uncurled straight hair several times. Now she began to look at my gaze with suspicion. Now, she knew I was looking at her hair; now, she answered my gaze with an apologetic look. But I didn't know what she was apologizing for?</p>
<p>I walked past her door again from the opposite direction. An unfamiliar girl with puffy hair was standing solemnly facing the direction I had come from. As I walked past this permed girl, I seemed to hear a sound like a nightingale. I turned back, and heavens, it was that girl who didn't perm her hair.</p>
<p>Now she had actually permed her hair! I was stunned; she smiled, a smile with flattery. I was truly stunned.</p>
<p>This girl with the last perm did not understand the true meaning of my shock, thinking I was stunned by her permed hair.</p>
<p>I was indeed stunned by her permed hair, but the "stunned" I felt was not the "stunned" she understood!</p>
<p>This girl with the last perm, this is our last meeting.</p>
<p>Rain Flower by Shi Jimi</p>
<p>That seven-colored rainbow is said to be a bridge from earth to heaven; but this bridge is not easily seen, it must appear after a great storm, and only for a moment.</p>
<p>The reason why roses are beautiful is because they have thorns; otherwise, wouldn't the movingly beautiful red monthly rose also be praised?</p>
<p>Peacocks have beautiful feathers to show off, and when they spread their tails, they almost dominate the universe, but other than that, they are useless. As for camels, these ugly animals sacrifice their lives to give travelers some favors in arid deserts without water, because within that unsightly form lies a useful water reservoir.</p>
<p>So we think of the omnipotence and greatness of the Creator, and how impartial and selfless He is to all things.</p>
<p>"When the cold winter is far away and spring comes, what will make you happiest?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Too much," I thought for a moment, "In the water country, there is the smile of spring brought by the south wind, and there are the melodious warblings of nightingales, the clear songs of swallows, bright flowers and dark willows, blue skies and fragrant meadows..."</p>
<p>She nodded, but then shook her head again, smiling: "You're right; but why did you forget to say: that clap of spring thunder that awakens and revitalizes all dormant things?"</p>
<p>Year after year, from spring to summer to autumn to winter, and then to the spring of the coming year; I watched peach blossoms bloom and wither, apricot blossoms bloom and wither, chrysanthemums bloom and wither, plum blossoms bloom and wither... A series of blossoms and withers never caused me even the slightest sorrow, never moved me in any way.</p>
<p>Do you say I am too heartless? No! They will all bloom again in the garden next year. The youth of flowers and plants is too short, but it is not like people, whose youth is only once; their youth is long-lasting.</p>
<p>Life and Truth by Hong Ye</p>
<p>"When life flows like a gentle song, it's easy for people to find laughter, but what about those who are truly worthy? It is those who smile in the face of adversity."</p>
<p>Thinking of these words makes me think of many friends who, like me, are young and living in hardship, but they have no resentment.</p>
<p>They understand this truth, just like me.</p>
<p>The truths in the world are limited. Isn't it most great and unique to be able to grasp one link in the sublimation of these limited truths?</p>
<p>However, when the surging torrent of reality rages across the plains of life, will this superman sink to the bottom of the eternal abyss along with the surging waves?</p>
<p>This is always a mystery to me.</p>
<p>(Two)</p>
<p>"Those who can fight against darkness are not the most valuable, the truly most valuable are those who can find the source of darkness in the darkness."</p>
<p>I am not surprised by this extraordinary uniqueness, but only by the terribleness of this uniqueness.</p>
<p>Darkness is the endless storehouse of world civilization. Even if you fight against it and destroy part of its endless storehouse, other parts will follow. What's the use? So people have to hold up the torch of truth to find the darkness. This seems very thorough, but when countless evil, hypocritical, and boring storms blow from all directions, won't this small spark surrounded by the fog of darkness be quickly extinguished? Unless you relight it with the match of courage.</p>
<p>However, is this match of courage easy to obtain?</p>
<p>(Three)</p>
<p>"When you feel pain in your heart, immerse yourself in yourself."</p>
<p>Yes, the taste of pain is very difficult to endure, I know it very clearly; because I am always wandering in pain. I think: Now should be the time to get drunk, right?</p>
<p>So, I held up a glass of wine and poured it down my throat, without any consideration; two glasses, three glasses... until ten glasses of wine, I was deeply drunk, this is so happy, but unfortunately, too many tears seeped into the laughter of the drunk.</p>
<p>The falseness between people is forever. Except for dreams and drunkenness, the sincere, beautiful, and primitive nature that people yearn for can never be realized.</p>
<p>However,</p>
