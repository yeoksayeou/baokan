<h3>全市懸國旗熱烈歡迎　蔣主席昨由渝抵滬　作勝利巡行慰問民衆</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十一日電〕蔣主席十一日晨搭專機離渝赴滬，定本月內返渝。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日專電〕蔣主席所乘赴滬專機，於今日下午四時過京飛滬，消息傳出後，全市民衆大為振奮，晚報出版時，曾以顯著之地位，刊載滬市赤金因主席蒞滬暴跌之消息，京市市場賣風亦盛，一般物價均見下落。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕我抗戰建國領袖蔣主席，昨（十一）日下午四時二十分在全市市民在熟歡迎情緒中，安抵上海，作勝利後首次之巡視。</p>
<p>主席專機「美齡號」，於四時二十分降落龍華機場，隨主席抵滬者，計有張主任委員道藩，國府軍務局長俞濟時，總務局長陳希曾，參軍長唐縱，秘書周宏濤，衛警室主任李鐵漢，侍衛組組長竺培基曁侍從武官吳文芝等九人。主席隨從侍衛則先於四時正分乘C-47型二六〇號專機抵滬。</p>
<p>「美齡號」專機原定在江灣機場降落，然在漢口稍事停留後，臨時改在龍華機場降落，錢市長獲訊後，即趨賈爾業路主席私邸，陪同蔣夫人赴機塲迎候。至機塲歡迎者，尚有黃仁霖·周至柔·宣鐵吾·魏德邁將軍·海軍上將柯克·空軍參謀長麥克納及中外各機關首長等多人。主席衣黑呢大　，神采奕奕，下機後即含笑與歡迎者一一握手寒暄，旋即偕夫人乘汽車駛返賈爾業路私邸。</p>
<p>滬地民衆與　主席闊別已八年九個月，抗戰前　主席最後一次來滬，係於民國廿六年五月六日，由京飛滬就醫，旋即於五月十七日由滬偕錢大鈞等乘機飛京。在抗戰時間，主席一度親至淞滬區前綫視察，惟當時行踪甚密，外界得知者甚少。主席留滬時間，截至昨晚止尚未有正式透露，據悉：主席此次來滬，係專為慰問滬市忠貞奮鬥犧牲之市民，主席夫婦日內將招待本市記者。</p>
<p>日本市市民歡迎　主席熱烈情緒，爲勝利後所罕見，本市民衆自晨間獲得主席來滬消息後，即懸掛國旗，燃放爆竹，以表慶祝。羣衆皆以為主席所乘之專機將於江灣機塲降落，故午前北四川路·江灣路上，歡迎者即人如潮湧，江灣路一帶，自中午起即有軍警布設崗位，市民夾道相候，爭欲一睹主席丰采，然「美齡」號專機臨時改在龍華機塲降落，十餘萬市民直候至薄暮始行散去。</p>
<p>主席專機係於十時許自九能坡機塲起飛，光是主席之侍從人員，於八時十四分分剩C47型機兩架先行起飛，「齡號」汝其他二專機於二時許抵達漢口，稍作停留後，旋即起飛來滬。主席於去歲末巡視北平後抵京時，即有來滬一行之意，嗣因美特使馬歇爾將軍來華，即行返渝，來滬之行，因而未果。主席此次來滬，當與去年赴平之意義相同，即將慰問民衆，視察各般情形並將訪求民隱。據悉：主席或將於日內接見各界負責人士，垂詢滬地情形。（主席抵滬情形之素描，請參閱第三版）</p>

<h3>雅爾達秘密協定　美英蘇同時公布　規定蘇聯對日宣戰條件</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕蘇聯於一年前之今日，參加雅爾達協定決定對日宣戰，曾提出三項條件，內容保守秘密迄今，該秘密條款已於今日在華盛頓·論敦·及莫斯科三地同時發表，依照該條款，蘇聯應於德國投降後兩三個月內參加遠東戰爭·以前一般人揣測去年八月六日廣島落下第一枚原子炸彈後，促使蘇聯提早宣戰日期云云，顯不可靠。實則德國於去年五月七日投降，蘇聯即於八月八日對日宣戰，為時恰為三月。協定中關於千島列島一項，率直規定「千島列島將移交蘇聯」，其他兩條件如下：</p>
<p>（一）外　人民共和邦之地位，應保持不變。</p>
<p>（二）在「一九〇四年日本背信的攻擊」以前蘇聯各項權利，應予恢復。包括：（甲）庫頁島南部及其毗連各島歸還蘇聯，（乙）大連關爲國際港，旅順復歸蘇聯租借，（丙）中蘇共管中東解。內稱：「三大國領袖已同意蘇聯所提各項要求，應於日本失敗後切實履行」。</p>
<p>美國國務卿貝爾納斯同時發表聲明稱：此項條款保守「極端秘密」，具有充分理由，因日本倘獲知協定內容，將立即進攻蘇聯，則美軍將增加犧牲，並將遭遇更多困難。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十一日電〕雅爾達會議業已一過年，其秘密協定亦於本日公布，美國務卿貝爾納斯同時發表聲明，爲此項協定之守秘密，而替故羅斯福總統，邱吉爾及史達林有所辯護，幷稱：中蘇關係，並不受此項備忘錄之約束，而實為云年八月十四日中蘇條約所範圍。國公布此一秘密協定，同時發表聲明，特別說明蘇聯參加對日作戰之代價。貝氏稱：公布此項協議時，吾人應注意中國政府對此協議之一方面，中蘇之間之關，並不受此備忘錄這約束，而係完全為云年八月十四日於莫斯科所訂中蘇條約各條款，及此後兩國政府間各協議所範圍。貝氏謂：三強領袖認為此係「軍事協定」應「嚴守秘密」，因蘇聯之參加對日作戰，實根據此項協定也。蘇聯領袖曾通知美國軍事將領謂，蘇聯於德國投降後之九十日內，尙不能參加對日戰事，因蘇軍調赴對日作戰之前綫，費時需九十日也。當時盟軍方有事於西　，猶需蘇聯能於東綫有所帮助。設或日本獲悉協定之內容，勢將立即攻擊蘇聯，其結果必使蘇軍自東綫撤退。貝氏稱：渠於云年八月十二日日本投降後九月二日，始得悉此協定之內容。</p>
<h3>民運輪失事　百三乘客傳未獲救</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口十一日電〕民運輪自渝載復員人員東下，行至宜昌，改由某輪拖一駁船續運，駛抵監利附近失事，傳乘客三百人，均未獲救。</p>
<h3>國府改組繼續商談中　二中全會後實現　京國大會堂即興工修葺</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十一日電〕關於國府改組事，幕後談判繼續進行，大抵三月七日二中全會閉幕後，可望實現。共產黨及民主同盟迄未推舉參加行政院政務委員會人選，董欲先知何人將出任院長，及政府將給於兩黨何種部長。同時，國府委員會中其他谷黨及無黨派人士所佔二十席，尚未討論分配辦法。聞無黨派人士建議自居五席，共產黨居七席，民主同盟及靑年黨各居四席。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕據社會部洪次長蘭友談，修葺國民大會堂之計劃，已呈報國府，日內即可招標興工，預期兩月完成。國民大會代表問題已經政協會議成立具體次議，將由政府送請國民黨二中全會通過實施。外傳國大代表將來京舉行預備會一說，諒係一部份代表爲交換意見，聯絡感情計。現國大籌備工作之事務方面，已告一段落。</p>
<p>〔中央社南昌十一日電〕贛國大代表推定蘇邨裝等七人先行赴京，參加準備會議，並電請中央趕修浙贛與南潯鐵路以利交通，蘇等日內即啓程赴京。</p>
<h3>蘇軍在瀋哈長貼布告　定六月一日撤退　內蒙在蘇策動下有新醖釀</h3>
<p>〔合衆社天津十一日電〕據東北消息稱：內業古正在蘇聯協助下，醞釀組織一自治政府，該政府一且成立後，將形成蘇聯與亞洲間另一緩衝地帶。據稱：該政府位於興安省王爺廟，正由中國共產黨及蘇聯陸軍顧問合組之十九人委員會着手組織中。最近外蒙古宣布獨立，同時蘇軍進駐東北，其勢力　及大連自由港，今內　又成立自治政府，至此緩衝圈遂告完成矣。該委員會主席為前蒙古保安隊司令白欣恩（譯音）中將，王爺廟現駐有蘇聯騎兵部隊，並據報該委員會內亦有蘇方官員參加，可供運用之軍隊約計一萬人，均配備日本軍器，其中四千人受白將軍指揮，二千人為中國共產軍。又據另一消息稱：該自治政府刻正向興安省其他城鎭擴張勢力，新政府在一月或六星期後將實告成立，同時蘇軍現仍留駐瀋陽及東北其他各地。據東北若干主要城市報告稱：蘇軍在瀋陽。哈爾濱及長春張貼布告謂：彼等將留駐東北至六月一日始行撤退。據久居東北之住民稱：彼等不信蘇軍將於美軍撤離華北以前自東北撤退，其間尚須經過相當長久的時日，蘇軍原定於二月一日撤離瀋陽，同時杜韋明將軍之部隊自去年十一月以來等待開入該城，但直至目前，杜將軍之部隊迄無前進之迹象，不過推進距該城二十至卅哩而已。據報，瀋陽居民現受蘇軍之嚴厲管束，德僑仍留守家中，同時笨重之機件仍繼續向大連搬運，蘇軍保衛該自由港區域之計劃，顯然仍在進行中。在大連以北營口區域，沿遼東灣海岸一帶，中國共產軍據報正在建築防禦工事。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕「東蒙自治共和國」國旗，係紅底，上書黃色鋤頭（並非鎌刀）與牧鞭。</p>
<p>〔法新聞社北平十日電〕據報載，東北政務委員會已設立三人小組委員會，負責處理散居興安嶺東西草原及東北西北部之蒙古游牧民族。</p>

<h3>大連接收困難　沈怡留平候命</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕大連接收。據悉，中蘇協議原定一月二十連絡官，同時第二次改定二月五日接收亦未實現，沈怡市長乃返北平，聞沈氏將候張嘉璈自渝返平後，再定行止。張氏赴渝，原定三二日即返，今遲遲其歸，顯示外交問題仍未獲順利解次，行營秘書長胡家鳳，擬最近率一部行營人員赴長春，但能吾成行，亦需視張嘉璈渝行結果如何。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日專電〕據悉英美在百慕大航空會議中，乘已獲致完全協議，使兩國彼此均有所謂之第五自由，此點即為芝加哥及蒙特利爾兩次國際民航會議中未獲解決之最重要問題。依據第五自由，英美航空公司得在彼此之航作案工具界綫內，載客飛往第三國家。倘此協議屬實，則美機乃有飛往倫敦之無限班次及無限容量，並得於倫敦載客及貨物飛往歐洲各地，至於英國則獲得橫貫太平洋飛行中，在檀香山降落特權。</p>

<h3>五百萬市民熱烈翹首企望　蔣主席蒞滬漫記　本報采訪室稿</h3>
<p>蔣夫人抵滬後第二日，記者就獲悉　主席定星期一蒞滬的消息。　主席為了不願驚動本市市民，故并未貿然肯定蒞滬日期，但上海全市五百萬市民，一聞到　主席上項消息，莫不歡忭萬狀。的確，我們對闊別了八年八月零二十五天的領袖，實在太使人懷念了！</p>
<p>前天下午一時零五分，本報首先據獲重慶發來的加急專電，說：　主席定十一日晨啟節飛滬，其第一批侍從人員，已於八時十四分搭C47型機號二一八號，由九龍坡機場起飛。　主席將稍俟一二小時，即可抵達機場，其專機美齡號及二六〇號機候命待發，同時，從市政府空軍第三地區懷司令部和戰地服務團上海分團方面，我們也獲得了一部份綫索，為了充實我們的報道，共分三組出發：第一組派往東平路　主席官邸，第二組派往江灣機場，第三組派往龍華機場，另一個記者則坐鎮采訪室內負聯絡之責。</p>
<p>國旗飄揚　如一片汪洋大海</p>
<p>出發之際，我們曾對派往龍華機場的一位同事打趣着說：你們可算是幸運兒，因為我們當時從各方獲得的消息都一致認為　主席專機將在江灣機場着陸。誰知事實證明預言絲毫不爽，幸運兒終於成為真正的幸運兒了！</p>
<p>在派赴江灣機場的途上，所有商店住戶門前，都已經飄蕩着一片汪洋似的國旗，每個人臉上呈現着無限的興奮。車至四川路，軍警已在開始佈圖，至江灣路，新接防的國軍一四六師士兵已在那裏躍動，十步一崗，威武森嚴。一時五十分，車抵機場，經MP檢查後，即直駛停車場。這時，機場除了一二架美機起飛和着陸外，一切都呈現着無邊的平靜。二時正，同業接踪而來，不絕如縷。記者在那裏得悉由渝起飛的第一架機已抵達漢口後繼續東飛的消息。</p>
<p>長空茫茫　渴待專機蒞臨</p>
<p>三點一刻，廿三團憲兵團長沈萬千也來了，同時市政府新聞發佈組長朱　白也來招呼記者。這時，茫茫天空中突出現了三架野馬式戰鬥機，不住地在那裏盤旋，引起全場二十二位男女同業的歡呼，認為這是　主席專機即將到來的預兆，誰知等等又等等，戰鬥機消失了，還不見任何動靜，有幾位同業焦灼起來，東問西詢，想查問個所以然。適於此時，彭學沛和孔祥熙公子的巨型轎車駛來，記者們好似服了一貼興奮劑，所有的疑雲頓即全數消失。大家眼巴巴的凝望着天邊，全神貫注地希望有一點機影發現。機影并不是沒有，但飛近了一看，原來是美軍的運輸機。</p>
<p>信號台上　好消息從天而降</p>
<p>天色漸漸的暗下來，風也刮得大了，記者還是抱着一個熱忱的赤心，等候着　主席的惠臨，甚至盼望侍從人員也能從速飛到。</p>
<p>四點鐘了，還是沒有一些動靜，最使我們詫異的，便是歡迎人員除了孔公子彭學沛和　主席的幾位親戚外，為什麼還沒有人來？尤其蔣夫人和錢市長，可是經新聞發佈組織員打電話去問市府時，回說：「市長剛離市府到飛機場去了。」因此，我們又翹首以待——等着四引擎的C47型機到來。</p>
<p>四點五十分，專機仍查無影跡。我們正在疑竇叢生之際，信號台突然傳來了一片大呼聲：「　主席已安抵龍華機場了，時間是四點廿分。請我們快回去。」這消息，使在場的同業猶如晴天霹靂，打得我們心搖神撼，然而這只是一霎時的心理上突呈的現象，過後便換上了一陣光明和歡欣。</p>
<p>離開機場，沿路哨崗見我們的車輛，魚貫直駛，還以為是　主席駕到，莫不立正敬禮。折入北四川路時，成千成萬市民恭立兩旁，歡呼與爆仗聲渾成一片，幾使我們慚愧無地·市民愛戴領袖的一片熱忱，也於此充分地表現着了。</p>
<p>東平路畔　宣局長來回三趟</p>
<p>寫到這裏，記者的筆要轉到另一個場面了。幽靜的東平路（賈爾業愛路），在昨天整整一日之中，呈示着極端的緊張和興奮，然而仍保持着它的恬靜，沒有什麼戒備，車輛行人仍可以自由通行，祗不過增多了八位新聞記者，在不絕來往巡遲，戴金邊帽的警官，航空委員會主任委員周至柔，軍委會戰地服務團黃仁霖及本市警察局長宣鐵吾等，於下午二時左右，先後乘車到達　主席私邸，尤其是宣局長最忙，一忽兒乘車走了，一忽兒又回來了，歷二時半至三時半，短短的一個頭鐘內，宣局長來回，達三趟之多。</p>
<p>主席私邸　一座半新式洋房</p>
<p>主席私邸是賈爾業愛路近貝當路的第二家，一所半新式，并不十分華麗的洋房。淡綠色圍墻上，矗立着無數尖玻璃，三扇鐵門一樣大小，一開啟隨即緊閉，從圍墻外面，可以隱約看到園內草木，和躱在籬笆背後的房屋，草地上停着蔣夫人的汽車。　主席的侍從室就在左側紅色洋房內，警備司令部的通訊兵特地裝置臨時電話，通到祁齊路中央軍校畢業同學會，隣居們時時好奇地站到門口或窗口來探望，行人們也都向着「九號」門牌指指點點，頻頻談論着什麼。</p>
<p>鐵門開　蔣夫人汽車突現</p>
<p>三時半警局開來了一輛紅色警備車，滿載着警士，但是負責指揮警衛的李科長并不需要，所以仍舊退回了警局。但他們卻帶來了消息，知道　蔣主席將在四時半左右於體華機場降落。</p>
<p>於是記者們立刻忙起來，打電話的打電話，備車子的備車子，至三點五十分，　主席官邸的鐵門，突然開啟。蔣夫人乘着一輛小巧的流線型黑色汽車，飛一般的出來。記者立即駕車緊追。不肯失去機會。</p>
<p>專機降臨　滿足了市民渴望</p>
<p>蔣夫人身穿黑呢大衣，頸掛玄狐，偏坐在汽車後座左側，除車夫外，別無隨從。汽車出東平路，即折入貝當路，朝南直達體華機場。蔣夫人車行甚速，記者緊隨不捨。及近機場，軍警戒備甚嚴，記者之車，突被擋駕。不數分鐘，錢市長周至柔等，亦相續而至。四點十分第一架侍衛所乘的專機，先行降落。</p>
<p>五分鐘後，主席專機「美齡號」降　後，記者在場外遙望夫人和市長等迎候人員前赴機邊。　主席衣黑大氅，緩步下機和往迎者一一熱烈握手，稍事寒喧，即偕夫人同車駛返官邸。至五點四十分，第三架專機到達。</p>
<p>四時半左右，徘徊在主席私邸門外的人們，雖然還沒見到　主席和夫人駕到，但觀察形勢，知道不一會兒就要來了。不移時，鞭炮聲大作，公館門外，頓形熱鬧，如沸如騰。記者們的精神也隨而振奮起來。果然，到了五點零五分，大汽車，小汽車，都接踪開到。　主席私邸的大門也早已準備着拉開，　主席和夫人所坐的汽車，翩然地駛入大門內了</p>

<h3>推銷助學章問題</h3>
<p>主筆大鑒：關於全市學生推銷助學章的事，我們每一個上海的市民每一個中國的同胞都應該出一份力，來救救失學的同學。學生推銷助學章，固然是極好的辦法來消除失學的痛苦，但是推銷助學章的事，本人有疑問三點：—（一）助學章上未印號碼，我見數枚助學章由各同學自己用鋼筆編號，如M1213等。我想究竟此助學章發出多少，未必能稽考，因此恐有流弊。（二）熱心的學生向大善士們推銷助學章時，善士捐出的數目往往超過助學章的票面，如二千元法幣一張。收的捐款當然多多益善，但是同學們給他榮譽章一枚以外，還是再給他一枚呢？還是找一千元給他呢？鐵報二月六日載有某人曾捐十萬元，此還是另給他正式收據呢？還是給他榮譽章一百枚呢？募捐之結果所捐到的錢，與所贈的章，不能符合，并且錢一定超出章數，不免流幣百出。（三）此等捐款日後在各大報上登載清賬否？捐款如何支配，清寒學生之請求助學金，是否向上海市學生助學聯合會請求？此組織之地點在何處？負責者為何校何人？此疑問三。以上三點，是上海市民亟需知道的，請上海市學生助學聯合會作祥細的答覆。我們每一個市民已經出錢的，都想看到圓滿的結果。祝同學們成功。　楊卜·二·九</p>
<h3>工潮處理之我見</h3>
<p>— 袁溯中</p>
<p>自從勝利到現在，上海的工潮，彼起此仗，層出不窮，報紙上每日都有內容類似的新聞紀載，不是要求發解雇金，就是要求救濟，不是要求提高薪津，就是……，五花八門，到目前為止，并未稍戢。</p>
<p>有人問：「為什麼河山光復之後，反而工潮風起雲湧呢？」這確是一個值得研究的問題。</p>
<p>過去上海的重要企業，大都為外商所操縱壟斷，他們憑着不平等條約為護符，多方壓迫榨取，不但工人抬不起頭，就是我們政府當局也無可奈何。所以工人沒有保障，政府無從置　，當然不敢輕舉妄動了。</p>
<p>在敵寇盤据下之所以勞資雙方能够相安無事，可以說全是受敵人暴力的壓迫。若逢工人罷工，往往主事的幾位代表會受到飛災橫禍。</p>
<p>至於投機牟利的奸商，只求出品迅速，工人要求增加待遇，比較容易達到目的。因為出品天天在漲價，反正水漲船高，區區工資當然不在其乎了。</p>
<p>自從勝利之後，收復區的敵偽廠商，陸續倒閉，工人在生活之鞭下感到威脋，不能不羣起要求原來廠主發解雇金，另一面請求政府救濟，萬一達不到目的，當</p>
<p>然只有料察責問撳起工潮了。還有幾家開工的廠商工友，在這物價高壓下，要求改善待遇，不獲解決而罷工的，也是數見不鮮。</p>
<p>改善勞動條件，提高工人待遇，確是當務之急。值此治外法權取銷之際，允宜徵前毖後，對於工潮之處理，務宜慎重考慮。政府調解工潮，在技術方面，力求簡單合理，根據法令，秉公辦理，不偏倚，不遷就，更不容有討價還價的陋習。資本家往往只顧圖利，而不顧到工人生活，資方自動的增加工人工資或給予年賞，似乎很少聽見，而勞方感到生活的窘逼，不能不在工資方面轉念頭，等到勞方提出若干條件時，資方纔感到頭痛，似理非理，等到工人拿出最後的武器（罷工），又不能不遵從當局召集談判，忍痛讓步，這樣一來，資方做了「蠟燭」、勞方自以為得到勝利，發生　　的興趣，於是一片罷工聲　　而起。</p>
<p>改善勞工福利，固為解決工潮的不二法門，但切勿片面遷就。對拿盡　體，不影響外商投資，發展我國工業，保障工人福利，要面面顧到，須以法治精神，樹立良好楷模，勿使外人視為畏途，貽為口實，影響國族前途。</p>
<p>總之，身為工人代表者，也不可濫索苛求，得隴望蜀。尤勿貪心不足，動輒用罷工相要挾，更不可蓄意慫恿，煽動工潮，一般智識比較幼稚的工人，祗要聽說是增加收入，無不眉飛色舞，隨聲附和，他們只知盲從罷工，而不知勞資雙方萬不可居於對立地位，須要精誠合作，互相諒解，這纔是消弭工潮發展企業的正當途徑。（二月八日）</p>
<h3>如疾風中的勁草　如烈熖中的真金　增加國家民族人格之光輝　蔣主席勗上海市民語</h3>
<p>蔣主席在闊別了八年八個月廿五天之後終於凱旋東歸，與江南父老重相見了！如果我們不健忘，我們當能深信，　主席是無時不在關懷着上海的市民，他曾說過：「我和上海同胞們雖然相隔數千里，但精神聲氣，無時不互相感通。」他此次的蒞臨，正可以給市民以一個更深切的堅信心。在「八一三」兩週年紀念日，　我們曾以最熱烈的心情恭誦過他所昭示給我們市民們的一篇重要的文獻，即在今日展讀起來，我們也還要為之心弦震動。</p>
<p>今日就是邪正不能并存，奸忠不容并立。</p>
<p>我所要求於上海同胞的，就是堅持正氣，保持人格，百折不回，奮鬥到底。</p>
<p>上海這一個地方與百年來中國的革新運動有深切的歷史和國民革命更有密切的關係，九一八以後，我們全國努力於獨立自強，充實國力的工作，上海的經濟界·輿論界·學術界·工業界和各界同胞，更從多方面盡了很多的貢獻。上海同胞一定要在中國獨立建國史上盡到他歷史的使命。</p>
<p>我們上海同胞輸財輸物，接濟前方的踴躍，堅忍奮鬥不惜犧牲的事跡，冒險犯難效力抗戰的忠勇行為，寫下了多少可歌可泣的悲壯歷史，建立了初期抗戰的光榮，啟示着我們最後的勝利。</p>
<p>我希望上海文化界和輿論界建立起堅強的精神堡壘。本此精神，堅毅奮鬥，報道正確的消息，打擊奸徒的謬論。要使他們劫奪我們正論的奸計，每進行一次，就在國民面前多暴露一次他們的卑鄙無恥。</p>
<p>上海是國際市場所在地，又是多少年來金融的重鎮。我希望上海的經濟界一致堅定信心，信用法幣，穩定金融。只要我們國民明瞭擁護法幣，就是愛護國家的表現，資本逃避，應該視同賣國資敵的行為，互相督察，互相告勉。</p>
<p>我希望在上海的青年們更要刻苦自勵。知恥自強。更要知道上海因交通地位的便利，各種研究進修，圖書工具的的獲得，比之內地要便利得多。</p>
<p>我們上海工界同胞們，務必要加緊團結，互相策勉，明辨是失，嚴別邪正，忍艱忍苦，撐持到底。</p>
<p>刻苦是我們的本色，一般工商業國家所認為無法忍受的苦痛，在我們本可以安之若素，現在同處患難之中，就要大家發揚互助協濟的精神。</p>
<p>特別珍重上海過去對我們國家的貢獻，像疾風中的勁草，烈熖中的真金，撐持這一段艱苦的時期，來增加我們國家和民族人格的光輝！（本報資料室）</p>

<h3>蔣主席凱旋上海</h3>
<p>蔣主席於昨日飛抵上海，這是上海一百萬市民八年來日夕翹首以望的盛事。蔣夫人說上海是她的故鄉，上海市民卻視　蔣主席是他們的慈母。過去這八年，是我們民族的生死關頭，也是上海市民離開慈母懷抱受盡惡隣蹧蹋的苦難期間。蔣主席凱旋上海，目睹此百年恥辱八載淪亡的上海，插遍了青天白日滿地紅的國徽，一定非常愉快，而上海市民的以仰瞻　主席健康的慈容，其歡忭必更難以描寫。</p>
<p>蔣主席昨天是凱旋。痛定思痛，我們不能不想到戰時，蘆溝橋砲聲一響，繼之以八一三的淞滬血戰，於是全面抗戰之局已定，中日兩民族的命運，便決定於過去八年間的戰事。這八年的戰事，是近代史上為期最長的戰事。自拿破侖戰事以來，世無前例。我以生產落後配備低劣的軍隊，與號稱一等強國的日本力敵，此中艱苦，自不待言。何況戰事又在一個長期中進行，熬不住早就沒落。然而我們所以能不顧慮這些，再接再厲，抱定以「不變應萬變」的宗旨，終於克服種種困難，從瀕於危亡的絕境，獲致光榮的勝利者，完全由於我們偉大的八年的戰事，不但擊退　　　的敵人，并且使我們達到了廢除不平等條約的目的。　蔣主席真是我們民族的救星！今茲敵寇屈膝，　主席奏凱，上海的市民，固然歡欣鼓舞，而　主席八年小別，舊地重來，與江南父老相見，當亦有一番歡悅的深情。</p>
<p>上海是中國第一都市，我們民族經濟金融的中心，國民革命的重鎮，抗日的前線堡壘。經過八年來敵寇的蹂躪，如今雖告光復，然瘡痍滿目，表面上繁華依舊，而民生疾苦實在日益加深。我　主席關懷民瘼，前於巡行北平南京之際，設人民陳訴箱，接納人民意見，可見我　主席如何關注人民福利。今番凱旋上海，我們與其來寫一篇歌功頌德的歡迎辭，還不如代表人民對當前之民生疾苦，毫無隱諱的有所陳述。　蔣主席的豐功偉業，深印在每個人民的心坎深處，無須我們來加以歌頌，將來自有春秋之筆，來盡其歌頌的能事。而　主席所深深關注的，不是對他個人的歌頌，卻是民間的疾苦，特別是收復區人民的民隱。申報復刊，早說負有申報民隱之責，故我們謹願就收復區民隱方面，向　主席有所陳述。</p>
<p>第一，迅速嚴辦漢奸，為收復區人民一致的要求。河山重光，瞬逾五月，而事實上英　案件之迅結嚴辦者，廖廖無幾。而且尚有大批漢奸，直到如今逍遙法外。漢奸之未能廣泛拘捕，及漢奸案件之未能迅速嚴辦，或有若干因素使然；但這在人民心理上終會引起不良的影響。忠奸不兩立，是非不能不分。今日在上海，不免有在敵偽時代恬不知恥，搖尾於日本軍人之前，而恃強欺凌我同胞的人，搖身一變，又在大搖大擺以另一姿態出現於我們之前了。這些人之應迅速拘捕從嚴法辦，政府宜無異詞。其已被捕而在偵訊中的漢奸，尤應從速公開嚴辦。日寇投降到今天，已經五個多月，而我們卻還沒有看見重要漢奸的處刑。法國的貝當賴伐爾早已公開訊結定讞，賴伐爾已被判處死刑；挪威的基士林亦已被判處死了；英國的「哈哈爵士」等人亦早已處以應得之刑，即有「馬來亞之虎」之譽的山下奉文亦已被判死刑。而何以我們的漢奸，我們的賴伐爾，我們的基士林，如今還未繼以國法？　主席近年以來，力倡新生活運動，以「明禮義知廉恥」昭示天下，這真是立國的根本。我們以為迅速嚴辦漢奸，就是使國人「明禮義知廉恥」的最好機會。</p>
<p>第二，上海一地，自收復以來，初則各方互爭接收，秩序欠佳，繼則物資封存，不能利用，以致工商業的運轉迄未靈活。最近則為運用接收事業，紛紛出現國營公司，即輕工業亦所不免。凡此措施，在人民原都有此　。查重工業國營，輕工業民營，本為我旣定國策。此次所組織之紡織蠶絲等公司，在性質上為輕工業，自以民營為較宜，乃政府卻於此際成立大規模之國營公司，似與輕工業民營之原則有所出入，將何以取信於人民？至關於接收物資之數字及其運用，迄未見政府有全盤之公布。為今之計，對於種種接收經過，應迅速公開發表，俾眾周知。</p>
<p>第三，關於民生疾苦者，則無過於物價之暴漲。我們知道，　主席對此問題，曾三令五申，嚴責主管當局高設法抑平，而無如言者諄諄，聽者藐藐。行政效率不但遲鈍而且笨拙。接收了許多工廠，儘聽它們至今關閉。接收了許多物資，也有聽其霉壞。而舉辦平價，則必斤斤較量，以市價七折八折發售，市價漲，則平價，絕不能收抑低物價之效。亦從未看到主管當局拿出什麼具體辦法使全部工廠即日復業開工，拉回生產。尤不可解的，是促成物價騰漲之主因，乃在投機作祟，游資為禍，而如何杜絕投機，吸收游資，穩定幣值，主管者只是開會商討，迄無實在辦法，坐令廢歷新春，黃金狂跳，物價暴騰，升斗小民宛轉呼號於饑餓線上！　主席此番凱旋上海，正當物價猛烈波動之會，上海五百萬市民願　主席奮其英斷，制裁投機的奸商，穩定暴騰的物價。</p>
<p>萬象回春！上海的市民在敵偽宰割下呻吟了八年，今逢　蔣主席曁蔣夫人的凱旋歸來，真是萬象回春，帶給他們以溫暖，帶給他們以歡欣。</p>

<h3>奚玉書建議　官價出售滬存金　對平抑物價當能生效</h3>
<p>近日本市金價物價劇烈波動，影響國計民生甚鉅。記者曾訪國民參政員奚玉書氏，據奚氏語記者稱：目前上海物價踴漲，如不作有效措置，實堪憂慮，曾以此事致電財政部俞部長，請迅將滬市存金依照政府官價出售，以平物價，為立可辦到而較有效之辦法，經探錄原電如下：</p>
<p>立可做到比較有效</p>
<p>「（銜略），近日滬市金價，扶搖直上，百物相繼踴漲，平民生計，深受威脅，人心惶惶，大有不可終日之槪。而本市各工廠工潮，雖甫經解決，今重受物價影響，新近所增之工資，以無法追縱物價，恐將因之復發，長此以往，社會隱患，何堪設想。凡此情形，諒所洞悉。王書竊以目前金價物價之波動，因外匯遲遲未定，以致謠諑百出，一般投機商人，推波助瀾，有以致之。但此事有關國策，容或一時未便公布，而現在平抑物價，固須兼籌並顧，戳力以赴，始克有濟。惟弟認為立刻可以做到，而比較有效之辦法，厥為穩定金價。故鄙意擬請我兄就力之所及，與貴部調劑金錢立塲，似應當機立斷，迅即滬市接收敵偽之存金，依照重慶辦法，以政府所定黃金價格，儘量在滬出售。或由渝運金來滬，朝發亦可夕至。如此措置，則金價立可平落，物價立可因以回跌，人心即可轉安，國家社會實深利賴。用特不　淺陋，謹掬陳管見，以供採納，尚希亮　卓奪，無任仩禱。」</p>
<h3>調節民食　儘量拋售食米</h3>
<p>關於近日米糧市價激漲，糧政當局表示：決盡最大努力，穩定糧價。為切實抑平米價計，糧政特派員辦公處，正不斷拋售食米，調節民食。本市米號同業，昨日往購者，殊為擁擠。同時正大宗食米來滬，以充實存底，當局對民食問題，今後決循旣往施策：（一）向產地米糧，充實糧源。（二）拋售食米，調節民食。（三）力使供求均衡，平穩糧價。解決運輸問題，疏通來源。</p>
<h3>粵菜業怠工　社會局仲裁</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市粵菜業怠工事，昨已由社會局擬就解決辦法，決定書將于今日分送勞資雙方，飭令遵辦，任何一方倘有不服，可于五天以內向市政府提請仲裁，決定書內容如下：</p>
<p>（一）年賞分二萬五·二萬·一萬五·三級，限七天付請。（二）二成小賑資方提百分之十，外賞提百分之五，其餘概歸勞方。（三）工資令各店自行調整。（四）美華·大東·四姊妹·開除職工復職事將來再決。上列條件倘為雙方接受，今日當可復工矣。</p>
<h3>電力工潮　雙方意見接近</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海電力公司工潮迭經波折，昨在社會局由吳開先局長張振遠科長合力調解下雙方意見已漸趨接近。勞方所提十一條件，昨已解決八條，僅餘一二三三條尚待今日繼續商討。此三點資方堅持公司行政不容干涉，勞方則以倘不能做到，即為職業無保障，故亦不允讓步，尚待今日再行開誠協議。</p>
<p>又該公司將於明日提前發給本月份薪金，上次不幸事件受傷者之醫藥費，公司已允負担，社會局並表示將對該事件澈查，於工人等遵勸復工表示感謝，並希能早日速談連決，以安人心。</p>
<h3>商務職工提四要求</h3>
<p>上海商務印書館職工，待遇微薄，生活清苦，本年一月份調整薪津後，不過一萬四五千元，殊難維持，爰於本月十日，以四項要求，再請社會局秉公調處。</p>
<h3>發往美各地　電報恢復收受</h3>
<p>美國西聯電報公司，前因發生工潮，發往美國各地電報，除華盛頓·舊金山及紐約三地外，槪行暫停收受。茲聞該公司工潮業已解決，交通部國際電臺自昨日起，並已照常收受發往美國各地之國際商電，前訂暫時停用掛號代替收報人名址辦法，亦已取銷</p>
<h3>美軍續審日戰犯　雙方有激烈辯論　定今日上午開庭再訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美軍戰犯軍事法庭，昨日上午九時，在華德路監獄，第四次審訊在漢口殺害三美軍飛行員之十八名日戰犯。昨日庭內空氣較前更為緊張，除法庭負責當局，及各報記者攝影記者數十人外，尚有旁聽者近百人。昨日審訊共歷七小時之久，尚未完畢，原被告雙方辯護官，爭論至為激烈。</p>
<p>審訊戰犯是否合法</p>
<p>開庭後，被告辯護官李文少校起立辯稱，美軍當局在華設立軍事法庭，審訊戰犯，係不合法之舉動。美政府在華旣已取消治外法權，且又並未佔領中國境內之土地：同時，軍事法庭傳能由軍事政府所設立。根據法律，美軍當不能在華組織軍事政府。原告辯護官韋斯脫中校，當即申述軍事政府之司法權，乃並不受領土之限制亦無審訊戰犯之限制。設立美軍事法庭之權，乃屬於美軍在華戰區總司令者，而美軍總司令之設立此法庭，亦乃受命於太平洋戰區之聯合委員會。此種情形，即在菲列賓·日本·或德國·均同樣可通行。中國政府有權設立此法庭，但被告並無權取消。</p>
<p>李少校再辯謂，中國政府並未謂欲成立一軍事法庭，如美軍總司令受命太平洋聯合委員會，而組織軍事法庭，則此委員會亦可致錯。至此主審官米都頓上校訊問雙方暫無爭辯，願將各意見考慮後，再行決定。米上校隨即一一提名日戰犯，問是否有罪，十八戰犯竟一一高聲答覆「無罪」</p>
<p>當庭提出證件四種</p>
<p>中校繼即敘述三美飛行員被捕，及虐待死經過。庭上宣佈休息，十五分鐘後，再繼續審訊。原告辯護官，介紹美軍戰犯裁判委員會毛納加少校作證，毛少校曾接官方調查此案件。韋中校共提證件四件，中有美政府致函瑞士政府，照會日本政府應遵守國際公法，不得殺害戰俘等函件。並有美飛行員歇弗中尉之全部報告及供詞。蓋歇中尉者乃與被殺害之三美飛行員華麥脫少尉·福勃斯軍曹·輝登軍曹·同被日軍所捕，而受虐待者，但幸未遭毒手。</p>
<p>華人三名出庭作證</p>
<p>原告辯護官，又引一三十四軍漢口戰俘監獄日本看守人立田外次郎作證，報告其在監中所睹美飛行員被禁情形，其本人曾供送彼等食物者。十二時，庭上暫行結束。下午一時半，繼續訊問證人，尚有漢口鄉人楊德有·宋文清·張家元·三人，特由漢口召來作證。由生長在北平美戰犯審訊委員會柏斯丁上尉，以極流利之北平語翻譯。緣楊德有者，乃住漢口日本民國火葬塲附近之農人，曾目睹日人將此三美飛行員燒死。張家元者，乃火葬塲種花匠，被日人強迫燒火，以焚死此三人。後將三人之骨灰秘密埋藏，並不告知任何人。至最近美軍當局至該處調查，始說明真相。</p>
<p>審訊至此，已五時十五分，尚有宋文清未訊，庭上宣佈今日上午九時再審。</p>
<h3>臺胞陸續返鄉</h3>
<p>〔合眾社本埠訊〕臺灣建設協會會長，今日告合眾社記者稱：在華之臺灣籍中國公民，於戰爭期間，備受日本人之壓迫，目下已有一部份遺送返臺，開始其新生活，刻正熱烈協助復興工作。第一批撤退之臺灣人共計一千八百十六名，係經美軍聯合國善後救濟總署，中國善後救濟總署，及中國第三方面軍上海遣返總部之協助，乘美國運輸艦「倫米斯」號返臺。目下尚有數千人在滬，等待遣送。據估計，臺灣人六千名將經上海返鄉，此項工作，因缺乏船隻而稽延。</p>

<h3>吳興路周家宅　前夜發生大血案　紅舞女及母弟三人被害　兇犯肇事後亦飲彈自盡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬西吳興路五一七弄周家宅C字三號，於前晚午夜突發生槍殺男女四名之大血案一起，被害者為一紅舞女及其母弟二人，兇犯於行兇後，亦飲彈自殺，茲將詳情彙誌于次：</p>
<p>前曾任「偽組織財政部長」周逆佛海之偽警衛隊隊長張新華，河北人，年二十六歲，現供職于中美合作社，公餘之暇，輒涉足歌榭舞廳，與新華舞廳紅舞女吳解英（現年二十一歲）</p>
<p>結不解緣</p>
<p>情好逾恒，闢金屋于華龍路某公寓內。兩月前張始移居于滬西吳興路周宅C字三號，吳母愛珠（年四十六歲），寄子吳解新（二十一歲，）均住林森路密康里十七號。其父漢卿在盧家灣分局為理髮師，於昨晚七時左右，解英偕同其母及寄弟同往湖南路二六二號中美合作社辦事處，邀張外出，同返吳興路寓所，商討解決</p>
<p>婚姻問題。比至午夜十一時半，房內忽發出槍擊多響，經同居者邵學生（與張同事）聞警啓門探視，瞥見其母吳愛珠，彈從右耳貫穿後腦，解英彈中唇部，左腿亦射中一洞，解新命中左耳，洞穿右太陽穴，新華擊中右太陽穴，自左角穿出，均已倒臥血泊中，厥狀殊慘。因時值深夜，故延至黎明七時許始投報該管常熟分局，經司法股股長張燦光率領大批警士馳往出事地點查勘，見屍身四具，橫倒房次，</p>
<p>鮮血滿地凝結，發現手槍兩支，一槍管內六彈未動，另一槍計七彈已用去六發。事後據記者查悉：關於慘案之發生原因，聞與桃色有關，因張床頭金盡，解英意圖琵琶別抱，老嫗愛珠揚言，擬檢舉張之漢奸劣跡，前晚之談判，殆解英擬脫離同居關係，致造成此巨大血案。</p>
<h3>拘獲日籍逃犯</h3>

<h3>原被告各有陳述　李澤昨再度受審　庭諭雙方儘可能再提證據</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨李澤案，再度開審，被告辯護律師曾提出多種證據，原告亦有所陳述，各情如下：</p>
<p>該案由劉毓桂庭長，偕曹駿·祝宗海·兩推事，及檢察官書記官等開合議庭，慎重訊問。被告方面所延章士劍··陳霆銳·兩律師均出庭。劉庭長於押上李澤後，即命書記官朗讀上次被告所供筆錄，部李澤</p>
<p>有無錯誤　李即稱有二點：（一）偽各商品統制會非理事長制，而為主任制。（二）賣與森大鐵廠之水汀鐵價，為每擔偽幣五千六百元，非一斤價。繼由陳律師起立辯護，陳述五點：（一）關於出售水汀事，檢察官稱當時禁止金屬品自由移運，但查市內移動並不限制，此有卅三年十月間之新聞報，滿載</p>
<p>買賣廢鐵廣告為證。（二）不僅新新公司將水汀出售予森大鐵廠，卅三年九月間，亦有鼎豐等兩家，將水汀鐵售予森大。（三）當時森大付款方式，係用撥款單分三批結付，因有多餘，有新新退回尾數之支票票根為證。（四）李對於地下工作有助，此有軍委會駐滬代表公署之證明書可證。（五）被告曾補助忠救軍大量軍費。至此庭上即命書記官朗讀上次諸檢舉人之</p>
<p>口供筆錄問舒月橋等有無錯誤。舒稱無誤，但補充三點：（一）李稱任偽商統會理事係被迫，此係自圓其說。（二）聘用日顧問事，李稱為應付當時局勢，然此係李自欲聯絡敵方。（三）李稱對地下工作有助，為何不早在警察局及檢察處偵查庭時聲明，而遲至上次開庭時始提出，此中有可疑之處。並由其他諸檢舉人韓武成·葉秋彬·等，陳述戰前新新公司偷稅賣日貨，因而被</p>
<p>當局處罰之事實。至此李即辯白其本人於滬戰後，慰勞國軍，協助救濟遣散難民等事實，以及營救地下工作人員新都飯店領班林耀坡，新新職員王志鴻·陳寶璋·王秋月，美軍通訊員黃瑞棠等人。並曾捐助浦東忠救軍楊海霖部偽幣七千七百萬元；與郭順等組織接濟國軍物資團；於盟機轟炸上海時，奉命搶救物資等，此皆可向第三戰區軍統局軍委會等機關</p>
<p>調查證明最後並稱：如於偽商統會理事任內，有危害或作惡之事，甘願法律制裁云。庭上繼即傳詢新新公司會計楊深銳，森大鐵廠經理韓志雲，及與新新公司有往來之新大銀行經理等，並審查出售水汀鐵往來之賬目。劉庭長因其中有兩收據</p>
<p>簽字不符　向李質問，李稱，平日簽字由其本人及其弟，與蕭副經理等三人負責。而檢舉人舒月橋等認為此中有疑點，雙方各執一詞。即由陳霆銳律師請求庭上派會計師，會同新新公司會計，向各方面調查一切賬目，此為最公允之辦法。至此，庭上即諭令雙方如有證據，至於一星期內搜集，待十八日下午二時半，再行開庭調查云。</p>

<h3>進出口實況　機械等不易驟來</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕復員以後，本國工業界，向美訂購紡織機綻，及其他機械者不少，但聞新式機械，短期內則不易裝運來華，因須優先供給英國等銷路故，即其他物資，如某種原料等，亦有相當保留，例如本埠定購之顏料，已有數批，但同業中人最近接到來電，其數量皆須大打折扣，價格亦須提高，其能暢運來華者，還是一般消費品較有希望，昨據某進出口商見告，以外匯未定，其進出口業務，尚限於以貨易貨，一時未易發展</p>

<h3>投機帮受當頭棒　金價軋跌十萬　美鈔港票均跟跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨投機家脆弱之心靈，經不起蔣主席蒞滬消息之打擊，有所顯忌，銀錢業紛紛收縮拆放，銀根奇緊，多頭斬殺不已，供過於求下，跌風慘厲，近午更甚，查晨開雖為一三九萬，隔週浮多鑒於蔣主席蒞滬之訊，遭受當頭棒喝，爭先搶賣，一路盤跌至一二九萬以下，始見平定，逢低銀樓補進，此後回好至一三二萬而轉盤局，無奈回風伊始，頽勢已成，多方陣容立脚難穩，開始斬，多，「十天期」拆放旣需歸還，同時銀錢兩業除收還舊欠頭寸外，新欠格於環境，頗多顧慮，難以從命，趾高氣揚之投機家，至此埀頭傷氣，近午再起跌風，午刻竟退至一二二萬以下而後稍回，現交最後約一二四萬餘，較上週六慘跌十萬，午後隔日交割自一二五萬升至一二七萬，川帮銀行賣意股勤，銀樓工人一度罷工，傳飾金銀樓無意收進，並傳黃金有在滬掛牌訊，又復盤跌至一一五萬，銀樓飾金步减至十二萬六，紋銀一千三，銀元七百八，晴拆息價自一角二至一角八，最後一角六。</p>
<p>美鈔雖受金市影響，，同告慘跌，但因投機氣氛較淡，並無浮多立足，雖跌而不若黃金之慘厲，套價遂自七二〇元减縮至六九〇元左右，午後謠傳將掛二千對一，曾自一七八元升至一八二〇元，不旋踵金市暴跌，美鈔不免跟縱下游，最後一七五〇元左右，套頭亦再軋近至六五〇元對十兩，較上週六回跌一五〇元，港票老貨雖被帶小，但銀行有買，極為穩健，新貨則以低價結束，結果老貨跌三十元，新跌十五元。</p>
<h3>「禁做」消息傳怖　股票皆現低價</h3>
<p>華股亦因環境不利，缺乏新刺激，多方恐慌下，供過於求，永紗自二六八〇元，美亞二〇六〇元，景福自一三八元節節下游，中途雖有掙扎，午收仍見低價，蛟上週六計永紗美亞各跌四百餘元，景福跌二二元，勤興二四元，新光二五元，其餘冷門各股亦跟跌一成至二成左右，收後喊價因有禁做消息，續有降落。</p>
<p>外股晨開即見小挫，受主缺乏，賣戶亟欲脫手，午刻都以低價及賣盤結束，較上週六各跌一成至二成不等，且屬賣方供價居多</p>
<h3>公債大跌　統內小小百元</h3>
<p>公債昨因報載統甲須待關稅有餘，方可還本，其餘外債則歸中央先行墊付之訊，多方奢望又告冷淡，爭先了結，人心頗現恐慌，丙種初開尚穩，惟屬賣戶孔殷，自二二二〇元一路盤跌，中途雖有數度盤旋，無奈散戶恐慌，業中大戶又迫於銀根，無能為力，午刻都以低價結束，丙種連破七關而以一六〇〇元賣價收市，結果較上週六慘跌六百元，甲乙跌二七〇元，丁跌一七〇元，戊跌二八〇元。</p>
<h3>紗市平靜</h3>
<p>昨日市轉趨平靜，蓋金價突見回跌，人心因是而軟，十六支光明成交六十八九萬，以同行買賣居多，廿支藍鳳七十六萬，特雙馬九十三萬，供售有人，然各方買意因赤金下降而轉淡綜計廿支紗回跌一二萬元，四十支單紗及四十二支藍鳳綫價尚稱穩定，較上週末反升　之譜。</p>
<h3>現棉銷路日暢　價比上週再升</h3>
<p>昨日現棉交易甚暢，市價頻昻，仍以中紡建設公司採辦為濃，多數為四十二支及三十二支等細絨原料，粗絨交易不多，價比上星期六又升二三千元不等，</p>
<h3>呢羢新交有限</h3>
<p>呢　　　交易，　來零星分料，躉批賣買，俱見有限，一因紅盤開價昻貴，二因各號在上月份咸有相當購進，三因為時尚早，春銷暢活與否難定，以致本街客帮及諸買方，均存觀望，公茶會上情勢遠不如往年之盛，同業谷號仍沿舊例，在元宵節前，均提早打烊。</p>
<h3>投機交易歛　絲綢價均疲軟</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲維持週六原盤，一二〇號天橋現貨最小喊一百七十五萬元，最後喊一百八十萬元，廠銷去胃呆滯，現貨毫無交易，棧單上午做一百十七萬元，下午做一百十九萬元，一二〇號雜牌價做低，較天橋短十萬元，廠經受黃金價降影響，售價較週六略短，惟中級另祖，搜求基殷，持貨者不願廉售，綢貨大誠格璧縐跌風甚厲，與週六相比，每碼計短二百元，美亞被面每百條跌二萬元，人心虛軟，交易淸淡。</p>
<h3>茶價步步高　台灣茶已到滬</h3>
<p>查久無到源之台灣紅綠茶，聞邇來已有千餘箱抵滬，其品質尚佳，不日即將應市，至於本市茶葉市况，仍承上週漲風，兼以買氣濃厚，貨方居奇之念，愈演愈烈，致價格步見上升，若苿莉頂綠花，每祖突破三十萬元大關，其他花色，莫不一致追蹤向上，綜觀目前情形，實銷不减，而市上存底寥若晨星，且以距離產茶期尚遠，不敷需求甚多，前途亟呈樂觀云。</p>
<h3>食糖標價略增</h3>
<p>食糖昨市公會續有標售，價格略增，計二十二號中砂白須兼搭十八號中砂白十分之二，標價同為四萬八千元，比前升二千元，生砂赤五萬五千元，靑糖三萬三千元，升三千元，包額共達七千餘件，客貨開價稍定，中砂白為五萬一二千元，餘乏成交，因出戶較少。</p>
<h3>新鈔票到滬　由美運來四千箱</h3>
<p>大批鈔票由美運來，裝英輪意槐辦托司號，計四千零二十一箱，自紐的裝儎，係中央銀行之鈔票，該項鈔票尚須蓋印後，始可發行，其中另有樣子乙箱。</p>
<h3>平價米加價　米市益見挺俏</h3>
<p>昨日各貨一致軟化，惟獨米價反見挺秀，糧政局平價米，亦隨市加價，以致人心更堅，粳秈米及白元均加三五百元，黃豆疲百餘元，豆　亦平庸，麵粉回小一二百元，油市以靑島生油抵申，店胃轉呆，生油小二三千元，豆油小千餘元，</p>
<h3>金菜再創新高價</h3>
<p>金針菜以客銷不寂，市價雖已高昻，但仍繼續上展，如上中莊貨又升一成許，開至十四萬元，高貨照加，趨勢堅挺，實為歷來所罕見，</p>
<h3>煤市漲風漸緩　被扣烟煤可望釋放　外埠來貨絡繹不斷</h3>
<p>烟煤屑商辦到貨，前被扣於麥根路車站，現奉經濟部上海區燃料管理委員會令，姑念不諳新章，准其據實呈報，候核放行，是以市塲現貨頓見寬裕，又聞燃料管理局因最近烟煤到貨較多，亦將舉辦平賣，故人心均見平穗，各戶逢高頻吐，漲風漸趨緩和，惟烟煤塊則因實貸仍感不敷，行情步見上升，至白煤因外埠各地存底亦薄，採辦運輸，須經燃料管理局核准，不得私自辦理，致到貨說减，雖因平責民生白煤業巳分區辦理，但其數量甚微，亦不得週轉購買，是以賣戶喊價又趨緊俏，辛實銷平常，行情不甚高漲。</p>
<p>又訊本市燃料，經濟部燃料委員會管制及疏通來源後，形勢逐漸好轉，來貨接踵不斷，前日美輪司還而維脫攀鐵矮號，由秦島運來煤九千六百噸，停泊義泰興碼頭起卸，聞鴻基白煤日內亦將到滬，</p>
<h3>白鉛絲行情俏利</h3>
<p>白鉛絲亦名冲新鉛絲，有軟硬性之別，目下二者均有生意，十五六號軟白鉛絲，鏡子廠家搜購甚急，而十二三號硬白鉛絲，則有彈簧業在儘量買進，因此行市甚俏，現每担開出之價為五萬五千元云，</p>

<p>雜感</p>
<h3>少年老成</h3>
<p>— 小山</p>
<p>年紀長一點的，對年靑的小夥子常有一種期望。這種期望的標準，幾乎同出一轍的是「少年老成」！</p>
<p>所謂「少年老成」，不止是「早熟」，並且是「早衰」。</p>
<p>早一點通曉世故人情，早一點倣傚老奸巨猾，早一天領會進退應付，早一天學習虛僞敷衍。</p>
<p>因此，你看見社會上充斥一班老三老四的「小老頭」！憑着他們的年齡，他們應該充滿了朝氣，活潑，天眞，純潔；他們應該具一點勇氣，正義，他們也應該做幾次「大砲」，顯幾分「稚氣」！</p>
<p>但是，他們就範了。他們已經套上「老成」的枷柵，他們已經跨過「靑春」，踏到人生的另一端——「老」。他們跟着有年紀的人談談老話，使使老氣，擺擺老樣，他們已經像鍋爐裘燒過的煤屑，點不着生命之火了。</p>
<p>柯爾敎授給我們一句話：「如果這一段沒有成熟，休想下一段發育」。不讓少年的細胞繁殖到牠的容度，就是一個「枯」的人生。</p>
<p>我們不反對少年人該有的修義，該具的知識，該拓的胸襟，但這些不是呌我們越過本階段，而念「老入經」。</p>
<p>「老成」是什麼？</p>
<p>老成是來一個「等因」，答一個「奉此」。</p>
<p>老成是不開口，甚至不睜眼。</p>
<p>老成是儘量點頭！</p>
<p>老成是主人拿出來的若是豆腐，我就表示「從來不吃肉！」</p>
<p>老成是右耳裝聾，左耳塞上棉花。</p>
<p>老成是穿上破棉袍，把金條塞在襪統裏。</p>
<p>老成是向着太陽打「哈哈」，每逢陰雨呌「老天」！</p>
<p>老成是把朋友弄死了，還送去一份「奠禮」。</p>
<p>我的朋友，我寗願你被人看為「孩子氣」，不願你沾上「老成味」。今天謊言，虛僞，已經佔據宇宙的每一角，用不着你再去充實牠的陣容。</p>
<p>「一直保守你的少年，眞，熱！」</p>
<p>請你記得歌德的話！</p>
<p>文字</p>
<h3>釋黨</h3>
<p>— 彭堯</p>
<p>「黨」字不是壞字眼，似乎張申府先生在政治協商會裏，對於「黨」字的解釋，有點兒誤會</p>
<p>他說：「黨所近把中國害苦了。中國人是不喜歡的，古語有云君子羣而不黨，而且從字義講，黨為尙黑，是喜好黑暗的。」此語一出，無黨無派者相視一笑。於是有些報紙就說這是意味深刻的發揮。其實字義並不是這麼解釋，他完全是望文生義信口發揮，攻擊任何黨的黑暗的一部份則可，若是就黨論黨，實在犯了文字這上訓變壓詁的錯誤啊！</p>
<p>按黨，說文：「不鮮也，從尚黑。」就是衆多的意思。黑為黎民，為黔首，古代老百姓頭紥黑布，以示與官吏士大夫有別。尚為尊重，墨子有「尚同」「尚賢」篇可證。尚黑應該尊重老百姓，就是「民為貴」的註脚，「民主」的象徵。老百姓是衆多的，黨豈能離開民衆，古人造字的深意在此。</p>
<p>我們再看另一部字書釋名也說：「五百家為黨，黨長也，一聚之所尊長也。」並不曾把黨看輕。揚子方言：「黨，曉，哲，知也。楚謂之黨，或曰曉；齊來之間謂之哲。」現在俗語呌做曉得，懂得，知道，「懂」即是「黨」，本爲古音，不過方言有不同。旣然號構一個黨，就該懂得民衆心理，知曉人民苦痛，才能代表人民說話，提出正當要求；次不是糊裏糊塗地就能組黨，而號稱為某黨的黨魁。</p>
<p>黨有美善之義，載在廣韻廣雅兩書，為一般人所稱道，並沒有菲薄鄙棄的話。其所以有「君子不黨」及什麼「朋黨」的揶揄者，也不過因為他們有朋比為奸或植黨營私的行為，才有這種偶然的論調，並非一槪抹殺。這是辯證法和邏輯學上有交代，豈能指鹿為馬，將無作有？</p>
<p>漢代黨錮，唐代牛（僧孺）李（德裕），宋代洛蜀朔，明代東林非東林，其黨人有君子，有小人，本不可以一概而論。孔二先生生長在君主專制時代，抱的是「民可使由之，不可使知之」的政策，提倡的是「國家有道，則士庶人不議」的精神，這種見解當然不合式於現在民主自由，盛行政黨政治的今日。拿「君子不黨」的陳腐話來批評現在的政黨和革命黨，未免是時代錯誤，比喻不倫了。</p>
<p>再就事實上看，邵力子先生答辯得好：「中國如無同盟會，則不能推翻滿淸政府；如無十三年國民黨改組，則不能推翻北洋軍閥；又如無八年來國民黨領導抗戰，中國今日已不知成為何等局面。大戰以來，世界各國無不痛苦，何况中國抗戰最先，受害最慘？目前國家苦難，吾人自當反省，然若謂係為黨所害，則絕不公道」。實在是顚仆不破的名言。</p>
<p>我們不恨黨，而且願意加入有政見有作為的黨，從事於光明的鬥爭，不顧意看無謂的搗亂。黨是光明，不是黑暗。黨是民為貴，不是分贓於少數人。這是天經地義，希望辦任何黨的先生們要懂得。離開了民衆，不『尚黑』，便沒有了黨。光是靠儻來機會而成黨，擋住正義而號召，那是沒有黨的基礎，怎麼能够談黨？</p>

<h3>從土地的整理到使用</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>這些時候，因爲上海市地政局的開始辦理地籍整理，舉辦所有權登記，使土地問題，重新在人們口頭提起。</p>
<p>為什麼土地要整理？怎樣去整理？土地的整理完畢是不是認為已經達到了目的？</p>
<p>土地的需要整理，其急迫性正與戶口的需要淸理一樣，其重要性容或還駕而過之。沒有了整個土地的精確統計，一切生產，建設的計劃都成了沒有根的虛浮物。可是，不幸得很，在我們這一個「馬馬虎虎」的國家裏，什麼都「馬馬虎虎」，地籍更是亂得一團糟。就拿上海市來說，上海市的地價，在全國無疑是佔首位的，其地籍也七零八落。譬如說，業主的執業證件，有的是前淸的方單，有的是外商戶名的永租契又稱道契，有的是地政局出的土地執業證，更有的是只有一小角的劈單，或是銀行信託公司地產部出立的分道契，或者有的竟什麼憑據也沒有，却有着一大塊的地。相反的，也有許多人，手裏執着土地的證件，其實它的土地因收用馬路早就築去路地了。你想，這麼多種類的證件，出自各種的機關，經過長長的年代，成怎麼樣的一種現象，每個人大槪都不難想像吧！上海如此，其他窮鄉僻壤，更不必談了。地籍的不加整理，遠之影響整個國家經濟政策，使對於整個生產力量。缺乏凖確的估計。近之容易釀成糾紛，易起爭執。要把繁複的土地情形，依中國的慣例，靠「保正」一個人的腦筋來記憶，自然易引起錯誤了。</p>
<p>土地整理最重要的步驟，就是淸丈。等到淸丈完畢，戶地圖繪製告成，再行公告由人民登記，指認經界，確定地位，從此就個人講，產權有了永確不移的保障，而就團家講，地籍的淸理也就有了端倪。</p>
<p>上海的地籍整理工作，開始得很早，但因從前租界存在，一切受其障礙，更因受不平等條約束縛而必須承認外商所出的永租契，更使工作困難。自敵僞盤據以來，地籍自亦不免更陷混亂。此次上海市地政局的舉辦地籍整理，在收復區各都市中尚屬先聲，其工作無疑是至重至巨的。</p>
<p>不過，地籍整理，雖是土地工作中極重要的一部份，但亦僅係一部份而已，土地整理，只是一種手段，而土地工作的目的，在於充分使用土地，達到民生主義中平均地樅的主張。一般人往往誤解，以為地籍整理完了，地政工作就可繳卷，其實，地籍整理僅是地政工作開始的第一步而已。譬如說，上海市土地的價格，隨着市面的繁榮，當然一天天的上漲，投機商人，遂亦視之為貨品，寧可坐視其荒廢，待其價値高昂，至於在研究土質改良，在研究適宜的農產品的，或者計劃，其他市政上的興革，使土地合理化增價的人，我想萬不得一吧，地籍整理完畢，就可以開始第二步的工作，充分利用土地，貫澈總理平均地權的主張。</p>
<p>土地的整理，只是一種手段，土地的使用，才是我們的目的。第一步的工作，愈迅速愈好，而土地的使用，愈詳加研究愈好。因為這土地問題，關係整個國家的經濟命脈，也關係任何個人的切身利益，所以，國家固然要負責推動土地工作，而每一個人民，也義不容辭的負着協助的義務！</p>

<p>盲人不久即可應用一種電械器具，使他在行走時，不致和障礙物相撞。這器具是一個小型的盒子，內中射出一條細狹的光綫，由這光綫的旋轉，盲人就能知道他應走的路錢。當光綫射至電桿，籬笆，屋宇，或共他障礙物上時，立即反射至盒上的透鏡，再經透鏡而焦集於光電池上，於是聽筒上就發出營營的聲音，表示面前有障礙物。盲人從營營之聲音的長短中，就能知通他和障礙物之間的距離。</p>
<p>但是為了避免因太陽光或人工光綫所引起的不確的信號，小盒所射出的光綫像軍用雷傳遞器所發出的無錢常波，是斷斷續續的，而光電池對連續不斷的光綫，並不起敏感。</p>

<h3>Citywide Display of National Flags to Warmly Welcome Chairman Chiang's Arrival in Shanghai from Chongqing Yesterday, for a Victory Parade to Console the People</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] Chairman Chiang departed from Chongqing by special plane on the morning of the 11th for Shanghai, and is scheduled to return to Chongqing within the month.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Special Dispatch] The special plane carrying Chairman Chiang to Shanghai passed over Nanjing at 4:00 PM today. Upon hearing the news, the citizens of the city were greatly excited. Evening newspapers prominently published the news that the price of pure gold in Shanghai had plummeted due to Chairman's arrival. A selling spree also occurred in the Nanjing market, and the prices of general goods have generally declined.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Our leader in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, Chairman Chiang, arrived safely in Shanghai at 4:20 PM yesterday (the 11th), amidst the warm welcome of the city's citizens, for his first inspection tour after the victory.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's special plane, the "Meiling," landed at Longhua Airport at 4:20 PM. Those accompanying Chairman Chiang to Shanghai included Chief Commissioner Zhang Daofan, Director of the National Government Military Affairs Bureau Yu Jishi, Director of the General Affairs Bureau Chen Xizeng, Chief Adjutant Tang Zong, Secretary Zhou Hongtao, Director of the Guard Room Li Tiehan, Head of the Guard Group Zhu Peiji, and Aide-de-Camp Wu Wenzhi, totaling nine individuals. Chairman's accompanying guards arrived in Shanghai earlier at 4:00 PM, aboard a C-47 aircraft, number 260.</p>
<p>The "Meiling" special plane was originally scheduled to land at Jiangwan Airport, but after a brief stopover in Hankou, it was temporarily changed to Longhua Airport. Upon receiving the news, Mayor Qian rushed to the Chairman's private residence on Jia'er Road, to accompany Madame Chiang to the airport to welcome him. Those who went to the airport to welcome him also included Huang Renlin, Zhou Zhirou, Xuan Tiewu, General Wedemeyer, Admiral Kirk, Air Force Chief of Staff McNair, and many heads of Chinese and foreign agencies. Chairman, wearing a black woolen overcoat and radiating vitality, smiled and shook hands with each of the welcomers after disembarking. He then rode in a car with his wife back to their private residence on Jia'er Road.</p>
<p>The people of Shanghai have been separated from Chairman for eight years and nine months. The last time Chairman came to Shanghai before the War of Resistance was on May 6, 1937, when he flew from Nanjing to Shanghai for medical treatment. He then flew from Shanghai back to Nanjing with Qian Dajun and others on May 17. During the War of Resistance, Chairman personally went to the front lines of the Shanghai area for inspection, but at that time, his movements were kept very secret, and very few outsiders knew about it. As of last night, the length of Chairman's stay in Shanghai has not been officially disclosed. It is reported that Chairman's visit to Shanghai is specifically to console the loyal, struggling, and sacrificing citizens of Shanghai. Chairman and his wife will host local reporters in the coming days.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic welcome of Shanghai citizens for Chairman is a rare sight after the victory. After the citizens of Shanghai received the news of Chairman's arrival this morning, they hung national flags and set off firecrackers to celebrate. The masses all thought that the special plane carrying Chairman would land at Jiangwan Airport, so before noon, Beisichuan Road and Jiangwan Road were crowded with welcomers. Along Jiangwan Road, soldiers and police were stationed from noon onwards, and citizens lined the streets to catch a glimpse of Chairman's demeanor. However, the "Meiling" special plane was temporarily changed to land at Longhua Airport, and over ten thousand citizens waited until dusk before dispersing.</p>
<p>Chairman's special plane took off from Jiunengpo Airport at around 10:00 AM. As early as 8:14 AM, Chairman's entourage took off in two C47 aircraft. The "Meiling" and other two special planes arrived in Hankou at around 2:00 PM, and after a brief stopover, they took off for Shanghai. After inspecting Beiping at the end of last year, Chairman had the intention of visiting Shanghai when he arrived in Nanjing. Later, due to the arrival of US Special Envoy General Marshall in China, he returned to Chongqing, and the trip to Shanghai did not materialize. Chairman's visit to Shanghai this time has the same meaning as his trip to Peiping last year, that is, to console the people, inspect various situations, and inquire about the people's concerns. It is reported that Chairman may meet with responsible persons from all walks of life in the coming days to inquire about the situation in Shanghai. (For a sketch of Chairman's arrival in Shanghai, please refer to the third page.)</p>
<h3>Local Commanders Tasked to Assist in Restoring Transportation Lines, Executive Headquarters Announced Agreement Among Three Commissioners</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Beiping, 11th] The Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation issued Joint Communique No. 10 today, stating briefly: The three commissioners of the Executive Headquarters have reached an agreement to immediately restore transportation lines in North and Central China.</p>
<p>The following order has been issued today to the governments and Communist military commanders in North and Central China for their information. (1) All commanders should immediately take all steps to assist in the reconstruction of transportation lines as part of their fulfillment of the ceasefire order. These transportation lines include all highways, railways, waterways, postal facilities, telephone lines, telegraph lines, or radio devices. (2) All commanders should immediately remove or destroy all mines, naval mines, fortifications, anti-theft devices, fortresses, and other military works on or along all transportation lines. All military facilities that may impede transportation operations should be removed or destroyed. All acts that obstruct civilian travel and cargo transportation, such as forced inspections, damage to private goods or commerce, and illegal measures that obstruct postal and telecommunications services for any reason, should be stopped or eliminated. (3) All commanders should be responsible for protecting the technical personnel and workers of the transportation line repair teams. Any movement of troops for this purpose should be approved by the Executive Headquarters. (4) All commanders should be responsible for assisting the repair teams with the labor, food, housing, and other necessities required locally in all feasible ways. Labor should be given appropriate remuneration and should not be coerced. All commanders should also be responsible to the fullest extent possible for returning rails, equipment, and supplies that were accidentally moved due to the War of Resistance or subsequent self-defense. (5) All commanders should be responsible for executing the above tasks within their areas of control (the area controlled at 12:00 PM on January 13, 1946). Reconstruction work will be completed by personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Transportation under the supervision of the Executive Headquarters. The Executive Headquarters will dispatch executive groups to major regions to inspect transportation restoration work and, if necessary, will also go to other regions. Other instructions will be issued from time to time as appropriate. At this time, it is hoped that this highest responsibility, second only to stopping the conflict, will be entrusted to all commanders. It is hoped that all commanders will understand that this is to rebuild peace and prosperity in China. With the permission of those participating in the Chongqing negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the commissioners of the Executive Headquarters agree that neither the National Government nor the Communist Party can take military advantage of the restoration of transportation lines. Absolutely no troop movements or armed forces are permitted on the reopened transportation lines except with the permission of the Executive Headquarters. The restoration of long-severed Chinese transportation lines and the spirit of cooperation required to implement this matter will be regarded by all sectors of society and the world as an expression of sincerity on the part of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for a genuine and effective ceasefire. At this favorable time, all commanders should place this motivation above all else in order to achieve lasting peace. In addition to the above agreement and order, the Executive Headquarters today requested the National Government to provide technical personnel to complete the reconstruction of the railways, and at the same time requested the Ministry of Transportation to have its representatives contact the Executive Headquarters executive team as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Regarding the agreement to order all commanders to restore transportation lines and the request to the Ministry of Transportation to immediately restore railway reconstruction work, the commissioners have passed the following principles:</p>
<p>(A) For the convenience of this agreement, the word "temporary" refers to the period before the National Government agreed upon by all parties is formed and the execution is declared.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the reconstruction of railways and the work in Central and North China, the representatives of the Ministry of Transportation will initially be placed under the supervision of the Executive Headquarters. This supervision will be terminated immediately after the above-mentioned temporary period has passed, but with the unanimous agreement of the commissioners, this management can be waived at other times or for other reasons.</p>
<p>(C) Railway Management Group. In order to facilitate the smooth implementation of railway construction and execution in North and Central China, a railway management group will be established within the Executive Headquarters executive team. Generally speaking, the railway management group will not interfere in technical matters of construction and execution, but will focus on</p>
<p>(D) Railway Protection. During the period, the leaders of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will each include these teams, including technicians and workers. This measure can prevent the recurrence of destruction. Any troop movements required for this goal must be approved by the Executive Headquarters.</p>
<p>(E) Training of guards. Administrative management and executive personnel will be placed directly under the management of the representatives of the Ministry of Transportation and supervised by the Executive Headquarters.</p>
<p>(F) Priority of Construction. The priority of construction and activities of each railway line will depend on its relationship with the national economic recovery. The railway needs used to facilitate the disarming of the Japanese army and the repatriation of Japanese to their country will be fully considered.</p>
<h3>National Currency to US Dollar Exchange Rate of 2,000 Yuan Said to Be Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] The statement rumored in Hong Kong and Shanghai that the Ministry of Finance announced on the 10th that the official exchange rate of the national currency to the US dollar was 2,000 yuan is said to be inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Sichuan to be Built as a National Model Province, A Short-Range Air Network Will Be Formed, Seven Routes Opened, Provincial Government Purchases Aircraft for Operation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 11th] After Chairman Chiang's handwritten order to build Sichuan Province into a national model province, the Sichuan Construction Department has recently formulated an aviation plan for the model province, using the existing airports in Chengdu and Chongqing as the main bases, and SuiNing, Xuanbin, and Wanxian as auxiliary bases, to form Sichuan's short-range air network. The aviation lines to be opened include Chengdu-Chongqing, Chengdu-Wanxian, Chengdu-Yibin, Chengdu- , Chongqing-Wanxian, Chongqing-Yibin, and Chongqing-Suining, totaling seven lines. As for the operation of air transportation, the provincial government will purchase ten aircraft for transportation.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Transportation Forms North-South Inspection Teams to Inspect the Actual Situation of Transportation Takeover and Restoration</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] In order to understand the transportation takeover situation and restoration status in various places, the Ministry of Transportation has organized two inspection teams, one for Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) and one for Jiangbei (north of the Yangtze River). The southern team is led by former Director of the Highway Department Yang Chengxun, and has left Shanghai with more than ten team members for Taiwan. The northern team is led by Ministry of Transportation Technical Supervisor Wei Yifu, and this morning led eleven team members by special plane to various parts of North China, as well as Dalian and Zhangjiakou, to inspect. Once the Northeast Bureau of Lao Chengqing is finished, the northern team will continue to work in the Nine Provinces of the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 11th] The southward train on the Jinpu Railway stopped at Cangxian on the 11th, because eighty-nine sleepers were removed from the Zhenhe area north of Fengjiakou at around 11:00 PM on the 10th. The railway bureau has sent workers to repair it this afternoon, and it is expected that traffic to Fengjiakou will be restored tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 11th] Shi Zhiren, summoned by Yu Feipeng via telegram, is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the morning of the 12th to report on the damage to various railway lines in North China.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] The door to negotiations on the restoration of transportation has not been closed, but the door to success has not been opened either. What are the specific opinions of the Communist Party on the restoration of transportation? No official and specific explanation has been given in the past two weeks. Today, the Beiping branch of Xinhua News Agency revealed the Communist Party's claims as follows: (1) It should be guaranteed that railway transportation will not be used for military purposes and will not be affected by military affairs. For this reason, a neutral railway bureau and railway police should be organized, composed of personnel from both the National Government and the Liberated Areas. The former puppet police under the enemy and puppet rule should be disbanded. In the railway police and leadership organizations at all levels of the railway in North and Central China, such as the director and deputy director, the director and deputy director of each department, the director and deputy director of each section, and the director and deputy director of each station, personnel from the "Liberated Areas" should participate. Which party is the head and which is the deputy can be decided by the alliance according to local conditions. (2) Both parties should be responsible for quickly removing all obstacles on the traffic lines. The minefields set up by both parties should be removed by both parties. The fortifications and other blockade line works should also be completely removed. Those that are still under construction should be stopped immediately and leveled. (3) In the work of restoring transportation, the principle of cherishing the people's strength should be strictly observed. Military labor should not be used to avoid possible disturbances or other disputes. (4) Transportation should be restored in a broad sense, and travel inspections and mail inspections should be cancelled.</p>
<h3>Conflict in Pingquan Stops</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 10th] The Chengde Executive Team went to the junction area of Pingquan, Lingyuan, and Lingnan on the 10th to inspect. Mr. Grave, the US representative, felt unwell from the 8th due to overwork. Although he has not recovered today, he still set off with his illness. His spirit is commendable. Also, the small conflict in Pingquan this week has stopped. Chengde is now presenting a peaceful atmosphere. The city is full of gongs and drums, and the people are celebrating the first Spring Festival after the victory.</p>
<h3>The Li Fan County of Sichuan Province Will Be Renamed Li County in Summer</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 11th] The provincial government recently received instructions from the National Government that the name of Li Fan County in Sichuan Province has the suspicion of discrimination against border compatriots, and it has been renamed Li County.</p>
<h3>Refugees Gather in Xuzhou, Housing Shortage Threatens Travelers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tongshan, 10th] Xuzhou is currently experiencing a widespread housing shortage. If traveling merchants do not entrust someone to find accommodation in advance, it is extremely difficult to rent hotel rooms. This is true for private individuals, as well as for government agencies. For this reason, the Pacification Office has taken emergency measures, strictly ordering all military offices to concentrate their offices on a group army basis, and all offices below the division level will be revoked. The deadline for completing the process is five days. The agencies and troops that have been ordered to close must complete the closure within one week. The remaining houses will be taken over and distributed by the city defense headquarters in conjunction with the municipal government.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tongshan, 10th] The people in the Xuhai area are suffering from the disturbances of the Communist army and are displaced. The number of refugees fleeing to Xuzhou is increasing every day. Currently, the refugees gathered in Xuzhou are facing extremely difficult lives. They have repeatedly requested relief from the authorities. It is reported that Chairman Wang is very concerned about this and has telegraphed the relief sub-office to allocate supplies for relief.</p>

<h3>Measures for the Reorganization of Communist Troops, a Plan Can Be Made in the Coming Days, and Submitted to the Three-Person Meeting for Discussion and Decision</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] The pre-meeting consultations of the Three-Person Meeting have been progressing quite actively in recent days.

At 12:00 noon, Zhang and Zhou visited General Marshall and had lunch together. After lunch, the three continued to conduct extensive and further consultations on the measures for the reorganization of the Communist troops. More than ten issues were involved.

The official Three-Person Meeting and the Military Three-Person Group Meeting have been scheduled to be held jointly from the 14th of this month. At that time, the plan will be officially submitted for discussion and a decision will be made.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 11th] While Zhang Zhizhong and Zhou Enlai were conducting discussions during the day, Marshal Marshall met separately with the leaders of both sides several times. Although Marshal Marshall is only an advisor to the committee, he has provided many realistic details and all technical opinions on restoration and reorganization. Although the representatives held talks themselves, they followed Marshal Marshall's opinions in many aspects.</p>
<h3>The Yalta Secret Agreement Announced Simultaneously by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union Stipulating the Conditions for the Soviet Union's Declaration of War Against Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] The Soviet Union joined the Yalta Agreement a year ago today, and decided to declare war on Japan. It proposed three conditions, the content of which had been kept secret until now. The secret clauses were released simultaneously in Washington, London, and Moscow today. According to the clauses, the Soviet Union should join the Far East War within two to three months after Germany's surrender. It was generally speculated in the past that the dropping of the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6 last year prompted the Soviet Union to advance the date of the declaration of war. In fact, Germany surrendered on May 7 last year, and the Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 8, which was exactly three months. The agreement frankly stipulates that "the Kuril Islands will be transferred to the Soviet Union." The other two conditions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The status of the People's Republic of Outer Mongolia should remain unchanged.</p>
<p>(2) All Soviet rights before "Japan's perfidious attack in 1904" should be restored, including: (A) The return of the southern part of Sakhalin Island and its adjacent islands to the Soviet Union, (B) Dalian is an international port, and Lushun is returned to the Soviet Union for lease, (C) Sino-Soviet co-management of the Middle East Solution. It states: "The leaders of the three great powers have agreed that the various demands made by the Soviet Union should be earnestly fulfilled after Japan's defeat."</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Byrnes also issued a statement at the same time, saying: This clause is kept "extremely secret" and there is sufficient reason, because if Japan learns the content of the agreement, it will immediately attack the Soviet Union, which will increase the sacrifices of the US military and encounter more difficulties.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] The Yalta Conference has passed a year, and its secret agreement was also announced today. US Secretary of State Byrnes also issued a statement at the same time, defending the late President Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin for keeping this agreement secret, and saying: The relationship between China and the Soviet Union is not bound by this memorandum, but is actually within the scope of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 14 of that year. When the country announces this secret agreement and issues a statement at the same time, it specifically explains the price of the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan. Byrnes said: When announcing this agreement, we should pay attention to the aspect of the Chinese government on this agreement. The relationship between China and the Soviet Union is not bound by this memorandum, but is completely based on the terms of the Sino-Soviet Treaty signed in Moscow on August 14 of that year, and the agreements between the two governments thereafter. Byrnes said: The three leaders believed that this was a "military agreement" and should be "strictly confidential" because the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan was based on this agreement. Soviet leaders had notified US military generals that the Soviet Union would not be able to participate in the war against Japan within ninety days after Germany's surrender, because it would take ninety days for the Soviet troops to be transferred to the front line of the war against Japan. At that time, the Allied forces were busy in the west, and they still needed the Soviet Union to help in the east. If Japan learns the content of the agreement, it will immediately attack the Soviet Union, and the result will inevitably be that the Soviet army will withdraw from the eastern front. Byrnes said: He did not learn the content of this agreement until September 2, 1945, after Japan surrendered on August 12 of that year.</p>
<h3>The Minyun Steamer Had an Accident, It is Said that 130 Passengers Have Not Been Rescued</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 11th] The Minyun steamer was carrying returning personnel from Chongqing eastward. When it reached Yichang, it was transferred to a certain steamer to tow a barge for continued transportation. It had an accident near Jianli. It is said that there were 300 passengers, none of whom were rescued.</p>
<h3>The Reorganization of the National Government is Still Under Discussion, It Will Be Realized After the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and the Nanjing National Assembly Hall Will Be Repaired Immediately</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 11th] Regarding the reorganization of the National Government, behind-the-scenes negotiations are continuing, and it is generally expected to be realized after the closing of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee on March 7. The Communist Party and the Democratic League have not yet nominated candidates to participate in the Administrative Yuan Political Affairs Committee. Dong Yu first wanted to know who would be appointed as the dean, and what kind of ministers the government would give to the two parties. At the same time, the method of allocating the twenty seats in the National Government Committee occupied by other Gu parties and non-partisan people has not been discussed. It is heard that non-partisan people suggested that they occupy five seats, the Communist Party occupies seven seats, and the Democratic League and the Youth Party each occupy four seats.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] According to Hong Lanyou, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the plan to repair the National Assembly Hall has been reported to the National Government, and bidding for construction can be invited in the coming days, which is expected to be completed in two months. The issue of National Assembly representatives has been specifically discussed by the Political Consultative Conference, and will be submitted to the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee for approval and implementation by the government. The rumor that National Assembly representatives will come to Nanjing to hold a preparatory meeting is understood to be a plan for some representatives to exchange opinions and connect emotionally. Currently, the preparatory work for the National Assembly has come to an end in terms of affairs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 11th] The Jiangxi National Assembly representative, Su Cunzhuang, and others were presumed to go to Nanjing first to participate in the preparatory meeting, and telegraphed the central government to rush to repair the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Nanchang-Xunyang Railways to facilitate transportation. Su and others will set off for Nanjing in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Posts Notices in Shenyang, Harbin, and Changchun: Withdrawal Set for June 1st; New Concoctions Brewing in Inner Mongolia under Soviet Incitement</h3>
<p>[United Press International Tianjin, 11th] According to sources in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia is brewing the formation of an autonomous government with Soviet assistance. Once established, this government will form another buffer zone between the Soviet Union and Asia. It is claimed that the government is located in Wangye Temple, Xingan Province, and is being organized by a 19-member committee jointly formed by the Chinese Communist Party and Soviet Army advisors. Recently, Outer Mongolia declared independence, and at the same time, the Soviet army entered and stationed itself in Northeast China, wielding influence over Dalian's free port. Now, with the establishment of an autonomous government in Inner Mongolia, the buffer zone is complete. The chairman of the committee is Lieutenant General Bai Xinen (transliteration), former commander of the Mongolian Security Force. Wangye Temple is currently garrisoned by Soviet cavalry units, and it is reported that Soviet officials are also participating in the committee. The available military force is estimated at 10,000 men, all equipped with Japanese weapons, of which 4,000 are under the command of General Bai and 2,000 are Chinese Communist troops. Another report claims that the autonomous government is expanding its influence to other towns in Xingan Province. The new government will be formally established in a month or six weeks. Meanwhile, the Soviet army is still stationed in Shenyang and other parts of Northeast China. Reports from several major cities in Northeast China state that the Soviet army has posted notices in Shenyang, Harbin, and Changchun stating that they will remain in Northeast China until June 1st before withdrawing. According to residents who have lived in Northeast China for a long time, they do not believe that the Soviet army will withdraw from Northeast China before the American troops withdraw from North China, and a considerable amount of time will still need to pass. The Soviet army was originally scheduled to withdraw from Shenyang on February 1st, and General Du Weiming's troops have been waiting to enter the city since November of last year, but to date, General Du's troops have shown no signs of advancing, only moving 20 to 30 miles closer to the city. It is reported that Shenyang residents are now under strict control by the Soviet army, German expatriates are still confined to their homes, and the transportation of heavy machinery to Dalian continues. The Soviet army's plan to protect the free port area is apparently still in progress. In the Yingkou area north of Dalian, along the coast of the Liaodong Bay, Chinese Communist troops are reportedly building fortifications.</p>

<h3>Difficulties in Receiving Dalian; Shen Yi Remains in Beiping Awaiting Orders</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] Regarding the reception of Dalian, it is learned that the original Sino-Soviet agreement stipulated that liaison officers would be sent on January 20th.

It is said that Shen will wait for Zhang Jia'ao to return to Beiping from Chongqing before deciding on his next move. Zhang's trip to Chongqing was originally scheduled to last two or three days, but his return is now delayed, indicating that diplomatic issues have not yet been resolved smoothly. Hu Jiafeng, the secretary-general of the Executive Headquarters, plans to lead a group of Executive Headquarters personnel to Changchun soon, but whether or not he can make the trip depends on the outcome of Zhang Jia'ao's trip to Chongqing.</p>

<h3>Eisenhower's Speech: America Must Maintain Strength; Military and Civilians Alike Must Be Ready to Address Threats; Genuine International Cooperation Requires Eliminating Suspicion</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] U.S. Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower, in a speech to the masses today, said: The United States must maintain its strength until the world is fully prepared to abandon the use of force as a means of resolving international disputes. We must be prepared, or else fear will cloud our judgment and weaken our strength to the point of uselessness. Our army, navy, air force, and the entire nation must be ready to defend the principles we believe to be just and sacred, and to address any threat. I vow to you that to the extent of my power, I will do everything possible to eradicate the ignorance, intolerance, and stupidity that mislead nations into using force to aggress and cause you suffering. Regarding the issue of building peace, must it be driven by a shared and deadly fear before people can cooperate? This is necessary to defeat a strong enemy and is essential for peaceful coordination. Those who do not understand us must engage with us; those who suspect our motives must cooperate with us, for we also sometimes suspect the motives of others. To achieve genuine cooperation, such suspicion must be eliminated.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Report] According to a London broadcast on the 11th, UN General Assembly President Spaak left here today for Belgium and will return to London in a day or two. The purpose of this trip is unclear.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 11th] The Security Council is prepared to continue debating the East Indies issue due to Soviet accusations that the Java war is ongoing. However, some quarters predict today that the dispute may be temporarily shelved pending the outcome of negotiations in Batavia between the Dutch government and East Indies leaders.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] Soviet Representative Vyshinsky warned this afternoon at the UN Security Council meeting that the unresolved East Indies could be the fuse for a third world war. He also supported the request previously made by Ukraine, advocating for the "immediate" dispatch of an investigation team from the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and the Netherlands to the region. The meeting involved sharp words and frank language, no longer adhering to diplomatic courtesies. At that time, the British representative quickly responded that sending any investigation team would be an insult to the British forces stationed in the East Indies.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 11th] After the Dutch government's statement on its policy regarding Indonesia was released, Dutch-Indonesian Deputy Governor Van Mook held a press conference here yesterday, stating that the statement sufficiently demonstrates the new development in Dutch-Indonesian relations.

<h3>Britain in 1941 Faced a Critical Moment; Shipping Losses Reached Four Million Tons; Churchill's Secret Speech Released</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] Churchill's third secret speech during the war has been released. At that time, Britain was facing an unprecedented defeat in its history, with British shipping losses in the Atlantic War reaching as many as 4.6 million tons. Churchill told the secret meeting of the House of Commons on June 25, 1941, that a year ago, no high-ranking authority would have believed that we could continue to fight. Hitler's experts must have told him that our fate had been decided. In March of that year, Churchill had ordered that Britain's lifeline be defended to the death, with all efforts devoted to attacking German submarines and aircraft, and merchant ships equipped with self-defense equipment. Churchill announced that he would no longer release shipping loss figures. Roosevelt had occasionally mentioned the British losses, and the British government had previously agreed to their release, resulting in adverse effects on observing countries such as Spain, Vichy, Turkey, and Japan. The Japanese ambassador specifically inquired about this matter, and of course, this matter must have been related to the determination of Japan's national policy.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Establish an Agreement; Both Have the So-Called Fifth Freedom</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th Special Dispatch] It is learned that Britain and the United States have reached a complete agreement at the Bermuda Aviation Conference, granting both countries the so-called fifth freedom. This point was the most important issue left unresolved at the two previous international civil aviation conferences in Chicago and Montreal. According to the fifth freedom, British and American airlines can carry passengers to third countries within each other's operational boundaries. If this agreement is true, then American aircraft will have unlimited flights and capacity to London, and can carry passengers and cargo from London to various parts of Europe. As for Britain, it gains the privilege of landing in Honolulu during trans-Pacific flights.</p>
<h3>Rockets Guided by Radar; Humanity Will Be Able to Enter the Moon</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 11th] Recently, there has been news of radar contact with the moon. American scientists are now predicting that soon, automated [unclear character] driven rockets guided by radar can be used to travel to the moon, and wireless image programs can be transmitted from the moon. According to Professor Lee, director of the Northwestern (Chicago) University Observatory, "Rocket missiles can be fired to the moon without a doubt. Its realization may be within five or ten years. We already have fuel—atomic energy—and now we have a guide—radar. The amazing spectacle of the first unmanned rocket trip to the moon will be more significant than its scientific value. When humans can reach the moon and establish an observatory, we will be able to obtain a clearer view of the universe." As for whether radar will establish contact with other planets, there is still doubt.</p>
<h3>The World Food Panic Situation Reaches Its Peak; The Soviet Union Has Agreed to Submit Famine Relief Proposals to the UN; Vietnam Starved a Million People During Japanese Rule</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] According to a London broadcast on the 11th, China, Britain, France and the United States have submitted proposals to the United Nations General Assembly, urging all countries to increase production and conserve unnecessary consumption in order to cope with the world's unprecedented food shortages. The four countries also requested the Soviet Union to participate, and the Soviet side has now agreed to sign. The proposal will be presented by Bevin.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] After investigating the situation in 65 countries, the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts that the food consumption per person in the United States this year will reach a record high, while people in many other countries are on the verge of starvation. Italy, Germany, France, French North Africa, Spain, India, and China face the most difficult food problems. The world's rice and wheat supply situation has reached an unprecedentedly serious period. The production of various major foods has decreased significantly compared to pre-war levels, and supply is particularly insufficient during the period between harvests. Production in the 1946-47 season may increase, but its output will still be less than [unclear character] before.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 10th] The food shortage in Northern Vietnam is becoming increasingly serious. It has not rained for three months, and the prospects for spring plowing in various places are very slim. Last year's [unclear character] teaching has exhausted the remaining grain, and the price of grain has suddenly risen from 200 yuan per 100 catties to 800 yuan. According to information obtained by reporters from various sources, Northern Vietnam will need 400,000 tons of food in the next three to four months. This amount cannot be resolved by Vietnam's own resources. In the past two years, during the period of Japanese control, an estimated one million Vietnamese died of starvation, which is a major tragedy in human history. Although the war has ended this year, the Vietnamese people are once again trapped in the terror of a great famine. Foreigners residing outside are also terrified by this serious food shortage. Vietnamese people facing the great famine have begun to disregard order and are looting everywhere. In the face of this serious great famine, UN charitable relief organizations should send personnel to Vietnam as soon as possible to investigate and provide relief.</p>

It is anticipated that this will be Churchill's most important speech since leaving Downing Street, and it will specifically address the relationship between the three powers after the war. Since the deaths of Roosevelt and Hopkins, Churchill is one of the most familiar with the initial three-power negotiations. Perhaps there were other secret agreements at that time, which are not yet known. Truman is well aware that this knowledge is crucial for the decision-making of future American foreign policy, so he has to ask Churchill for guidance.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 10th] Kent Cooper, General Manager of the Associated Press, in a letter to U.S. Chief Representative to the United Nations General Assembly Stettinius, discussed freedom of the press, which was released today. The letter concluded: Mutual understanding in the world can only succeed when news can flow freely to all countries and be published freely in all countries. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to make good use of the new electronic sciences to greatly expand the world's communications network so that people can know each other. If this is not achieved, communications agencies will again be used by governments for despicable propaganda, and human thought will be controlled. The result of this will inevitably be military conflict.</p>

<h3>Cold Wind Howls, Moods Are Depressed; Japan Celebrates National Foundation Day; Government Agencies Closed, National Flags Fly Sparsely</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] Today is the 2,606th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Empire. Only Japanese national flags fly sparsely in the cold wind in Tokyo. The mood of the Japanese people is quite sad. The Japanese originally regarded National Foundation Day as a major event, celebrating it every year. MacArthur has specially allowed the Japanese to celebrate as usual this year, but all the national assemblies and parades previously hosted by the Japanese government have been canceled. Government and commercial agencies are closed for one day today. Japanese schools previously taught students that the Japanese Empire was founded in 660 BC, but this claim is now being doubted by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Trends; Old Figures Are Active Behind the Scenes; Still Possess Powerful Influence</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 11th] According to Kyodo News, political observers here predict that after the upcoming election, the Japanese parliament will be filled with unfamiliar faces, but they believe that the old political parties will still be pulling strings behind the scenes. The actions taken by the Japanese government in accordance with MacArthur's directive to purge officials will affect thousands of former politicians, civil servants, and professional soldiers who have been exceptionally active in the past. Hereafter, they will still possess powerful influence within their respective spheres of activity. The news agency went on to say that most of these people have decided to hide behind the scenes, intending to arrange puppet figures so that the direction of all work and actions will be in accordance with their wishes. Observers have noticed that this "dangerous tendency" is particularly evident in the Progressive and Liberal parties.</p>

<h3>Czech Black Market Profiteers Paraded Through the Streets with Placards</h3>
<p>[Reuter Prague, 11th] The Czech authorities are strictly sanctioning black market transactions, and prices are trending downwards. The risks for those engaged in the black market are increasing daily. The authorities are adopting medieval punishments for profiteers, such as having the police escort the offenders through the streets with a placard hanging from their necks, bearing the words "I am a Black Market Profiteer." Several people in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, have already been subjected to this dishonorable punishment.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Enthusiasm in Soviet Elections; Final Results to be Announced in Several Days</h3>
<p>[Reuter London, 11th] Moscow Radio announced: As of noon on the 10th, voter turnout in the Soviet elections had reached 91.6%.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 10th] The current Soviet elections have seen unprecedented enthusiasm. The Soviet Union covers more than one-sixth of the world's land area, and the number of voters could reach 110 million. Counting began at midnight, and due to the vast territory and the isolation of many voting areas, the final results may not be announced for several days. Military personnel constitute a relatively high proportion of the candidates, with at least 20 marshals, 22 generals, one admiral, and several fleet commanders. This has no special significance, as most of these individuals are simply being re-elected.</p>
<h3>Chinese Delegation to the UN General Assembly Proficient in Various Languages</h3>
<p>[British News Service London, 11th] In assessing the progress of the United Nations conference, the News Chronicle stated: One of the obstacles to the UN General Assembly remains that some attending delegates are not proficient in English, the official language. In terms of language proficiency, the Chinese delegation is perhaps the most successful. Dr. Wellington Koo, the acting chief representative of the Chinese delegation, is well-known for his mastery of English. Mr. Chang Peng-chun's argument for launching a new war to eradicate bacteria, delivered in English at the General Assembly, was a speech of the utmost wisdom. However, the true expert is Mr. Hu Shih-tse, former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, who is proficient in four languages: Chinese, Russian, English, and French.</p>
<h3>International Tidbits</h3>

<h3>Five Million Citizens Eagerly Await Chairman Chiang's Arrival in Shanghai: A Chronicle by Our Newsroom</h3>
<p>On the second day after Madame Chiang arrived in Shanghai, the reporter learned that Chairman Chiang was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on Monday. Chairman Chiang did not hastily confirm the date of his arrival in Shanghai, in order to avoid alarming the citizens of this city. However, upon hearing the news of Chairman Chiang's arrival, all five million citizens of Shanghai were overjoyed. Indeed, we have missed our leader, whom we have been separated from for eight years, eight months, and twenty-five days, so dearly!</p>
<p>At 1:05 PM the day before yesterday, this newspaper was the first to receive an urgent telegram from Chongqing stating that Chairman Chiang was scheduled to depart on the morning of the 11th to fly to Shanghai. His first batch of attendants had already taken off from Jiulongpo Airport at 8:14 AM on a C47 aircraft, number 218. Chairman Chiang would wait one or two hours before arriving at the airport. His special plane, the "Meiling," and aircraft number 260 were on standby. At the same time, we also obtained some leads from the Air Force Third District Command of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Branch of the Battlefield Service Corps. To enrich our coverage, we divided into three groups: the first group was sent to Chairman Chiang's residence on Dongping Road, the second group was sent to Jiangwan Airport, and the third group was sent to Longhua Airport. Another reporter was stationed in the newsroom to be responsible for liaison.</p>
<p>National Flags Fluttering Like a Vast Ocean</p>
<p>As we set off, we jokingly said to a colleague who was dispatched to Longhua Airport: "You can be considered lucky, because the news we obtained from all parties at the time unanimously believed that Chairman Chiang's special plane would land at Jiangwan Airport." However, facts proved that the prediction was absolutely accurate, and the lucky one finally became the real lucky one!</p>
<p>On the way to Jiangwan Airport, all the shops and residents had already hung national flags that fluttered like a vast ocean. Everyone's face showed infinite excitement. When the car reached Sichuan Road, the military police had already begun to deploy their forces. When it reached Jiangwan Road, soldiers of the newly deployed 146th Division of the National Army were actively stationed there, with guards every ten steps, majestic and solemn. At 1:50 PM, the car arrived at the airport. After being inspected by the MP, it drove straight to the parking lot. At this time, apart from one or two American aircraft taking off and landing, everything else was peaceful. At 2:00 PM, colleagues from other news organizations arrived in succession. The reporter learned there that the first aircraft that took off from Chongqing had arrived in Hankou and continued to fly east.</p>
<p>The Vast Sky Eagerly Awaits the Arrival of the Special Plane</p>
<p>At 3:15 PM, Shen Wanqian, the commander of the 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment, also arrived, along with Zhu, the head of the press release team of the Municipal Government. At this time, three Mustang fighter jets suddenly appeared in the vast sky, constantly circling there, causing cheers from the 22 male and female colleagues present, who believed that this was a sign that Chairman Chiang's special plane was about to arrive. But after waiting and waiting, the fighter jets disappeared, and there was still no sign of anything. Some colleagues became anxious and asked around, wanting to find out the reason. At this moment, the large sedans of Peng Xuepei and Kong Xiangxi's son drove in, and the reporters seemed to have taken a dose of stimulant, and all the doubts disappeared immediately. Everyone stared eagerly at the sky, concentrating on hoping to find a trace of the plane. The shadow of a plane was not non-existent, but when it flew closer and looked, it turned out to be an American transport plane.</p>
<p>Good News Falls From the Sky on the Signal Platform</p>
<p>The sky was gradually darkening, and the wind was also getting stronger. The reporter still held a warm, sincere heart, waiting for Chairman Chiang's gracious arrival, and even hoping that the attendants could fly there quickly.</p>
<p>It was 4:00 PM, and there was still no sign of anything. What surprised us the most was that, apart from Kong's son Peng Xuepei and several relatives of Chairman Chiang, why had no one else come to welcome him? Especially Madame Chiang and Mayor Qian. But when the press release organizer called the Municipal Government to inquire, they replied: "The Mayor just left the Municipal Government to go to the airport." Therefore, we waited again—waiting for the arrival of the four-engine C47 aircraft.</p>
<p>At 4:50 PM, there was still no trace of the special plane. As we were filled with doubts, a shout suddenly came from the signal platform: "Chairman Chiang has safely arrived at Longhua Airport. The time is 4:20 PM. Please return quickly." This news made the colleagues present feel like they had been struck by lightning, shaking our hearts and minds. However, this was only a momentary psychological phenomenon, and afterwards it was replaced by a burst of light and joy.</p>
<p>Leaving the airport, the sentry posts along the way saw our vehicles driving straight through one after another, and thought that Chairman Chiang had arrived, so they all stood at attention and saluted. When we turned into North Sichuan Road, thousands upon thousands of citizens stood respectfully on both sides, the cheers and the sound of firecrackers blending into one, almost making us feel ashamed. The citizens' ardent love for their leader was fully demonstrated here.</p>
<p>Director Xuan Goes Back and Forth Three Times by Dongping Road</p>
<p>Writing here, the reporter's pen must turn to another scene. The quiet Dongping Road (Route Jullien), showed extreme tension and excitement throughout yesterday, but still maintained its tranquility. There were no guards, and vehicles and pedestrians could still pass freely. However, there were eight more news reporters who were constantly patrolling back and forth. Zhou Zhirou, the chairman of the Aviation Commission, Huang Renlin of the Battlefield Service Corps of the Military Commission, and Xuan Tiewu, the director of the Shanghai Police Bureau, arrived at Chairman Chiang's private residence by car one after another at around 2:00 PM. Especially Director Xuan was the busiest. He left by car for a while, and then came back again. From 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM, within a short hour, Director Xuan came back and forth as many as three times.</p>
<p>Chairman's Private Residence Is A Semi-New Western-Style House</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's private residence is the second house near Beidang Road on Route Jullien, a semi-new Western-style house that is not very luxurious. Countless sharp pieces of glass stand on the light green fence. The three iron gates are the same size, and one closes immediately after opening. From outside the fence, you can vaguely see the plants and trees in the garden, and the house hiding behind the fence. Madame Chiang's car is parked on the lawn. Chairman Chiang's attendant's office is in the red Western-style house on the left side. The communication soldiers of the Garrison Headquarters specially installed a temporary telephone line to the Central Military Academy Alumni Association on Qilu Road. Neighbors often curiously stood at the door or window to look around, and pedestrians also pointed to the "Number Nine" house number, frequently talking about something.</p>
<p>The Iron Gate Opens; Madame Chiang's Car Suddenly Appears</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, a red security car from the police station drove in, full of policemen, but Section Chief Li, who was responsible for directing the guards, did not need them, so they returned to the police station. But they brought the news that Chairman Chiang would land at the Tihua Airport around 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>So the reporters immediately got busy. Some were making phone calls, and some were preparing their cars. At 3:50 PM, the iron gate of Chairman Chiang's official residence suddenly opened. Madame Chiang rode in a small, streamlined black car and drove out like the wind. The reporters immediately drove to follow closely, unwilling to miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang was wearing a black woolen coat, with a lynx fur stole around her neck, leaning on the left side of the back seat of the car. Apart from the driver, there were no other attendants. The car left Dongping Road, turned into Beidang Road, and headed south straight to Tihua Airport. Madame Chiang's car was very fast, and the reporters followed closely. Approaching the airport, the military police were heavily guarded, and the reporters' car was suddenly stopped. In a few minutes, Mayor Qian, Zhou Zhirou, and others also arrived one after another. At 4:10 PM, the first special plane carrying the attendants landed first.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, after Chairman Chiang's special plane, the "Meiling," landed, the reporters watched from outside the venue as Madame Chiang and the welcoming personnel went to the side of the plane. Chairman Chiang, wearing a black cloak, slowly got off the plane and warmly shook hands with each of the welcomers. After a brief greeting, he returned to the official residence with Madame Chiang in the same car. At 5:40 PM, the third special plane arrived.</p>
<p>At around 4:30 PM, the people lingering outside Chairman Chiang's private residence, although they had not yet seen Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang arrive, observed the situation and knew that they would be coming soon. Before long, the sound of firecrackers erupted, and the outside of the mansion became lively and bustling, like boiling water. The reporters' spirits were also invigorated. Sure enough, at 5:05 PM, big cars and small cars arrived one after another. The gate of Chairman Chiang's private residence had also been prepared to be opened, and the car carrying Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang gracefully drove into the gate.</p>

<h3>Question Regarding the Promotion of Educational Aid Badges</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding the promotion of educational aid badges by students throughout the city, every citizen of Shanghai and every compatriot of China should contribute to help students who are out of school. The promotion of educational aid badges by students is indeed an excellent way to alleviate the pain of being out of school, but I have three questions regarding the promotion of educational aid badges: (1) The educational aid badges are not printed with serial numbers. I have seen several educational aid badges where the students themselves use a fountain pen to write a number, such as M1213. I think it is uncertain how many educational aid badges have been issued, which may lead to abuses. (2) When enthusiastic students promote educational aid badges to generous benefactors, the amount donated by the benefactors often exceeds the face value of the educational aid badge, such as 2,000 yuan in legal tender for one badge. Of course, the more donations received, the better, but should the students give the benefactor one more honor badge, or should they give him one thousand yuan in change? The Iron Report of February 6th stated that someone donated 100,000 yuan. Should he be given an official receipt, or should he be given 100 honor badges? The money donated as a result of the fundraising cannot match the number of badges given, and the money will certainly exceed the number of badges, which will inevitably lead to many abuses. (3) Will these donations be published in the major newspapers later to clear the accounts? How will the donations be distributed? Should impoverished students who request educational aid apply to the Shanghai Student Educational Aid Federation? Where is the location of this organization? Who is in charge of which school? These are my three questions. The above three points are what the citizens of Shanghai urgently need to know. Please provide a detailed answer from the Shanghai Student Educational Aid Federation. Every citizen who has already donated money wants to see satisfactory results. Wishing the students success. Yang Bu, February 9th.</p>
<h3>My Views on Handling Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>By Yuan Suzhong</p>
<p>Since the victory until now, labor disputes in Shanghai have arisen one after another, endlessly. The newspapers have daily news reports with similar content, either demanding severance pay or demanding relief, either demanding higher salaries or.... Various kinds, and as of now, it has not subsided.</p>
<p>Someone asked: "Why are labor disputes rising one after another after the recovery of the territory?" This is indeed a question worth studying.</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai's important enterprises were mostly controlled and monopolized by foreign merchants, who relied on unequal treaties as a shield to oppress and exploit in many ways. Not only could the workers not lift their heads, but our government authorities could not do anything. Therefore, the workers had no protection, and the government could not interfere, so of course it did not dare to act rashly.</p>
<p>The reason why labor and management were able to coexist peacefully under the enemy's occupation was entirely due to the oppression of the enemy's violence. If workers went on strike, the representatives in charge would often suffer unexpected disasters.</p>
<p>As for profiteering merchants who were speculating, they only sought rapid production, and the workers' demands for increased treatment were relatively easy to achieve. Because the prices of products were rising every day, anyway, the rising tide lifts all boats, and the petty wages were of course insignificant.</p>
<p>Since the victory, the enemy and puppet factories in the recovered area have successively closed down. The workers felt threatened under the whip of life and had to rise up to demand severance pay from the original factory owners, and on the other hand, request government relief. If they did not achieve their goals, they would of course only investigate and question and launch labor disputes. There are also several factories that have started work, and the workers have requested improved treatment under the high pressure of prices, and strikes have broken out when they could not be resolved, which is not uncommon.</p>
<p>Improving working conditions and raising workers' treatment are indeed urgent tasks. At this time when extraterritoriality is abolished, it is appropriate to learn from the past and be careful in the future. The handling of labor disputes should be carefully considered. The government should mediate labor disputes, and in terms of technology, strive for simplicity and reasonableness, handle them impartially and in accordance with laws and regulations, without bias, without compromise, and without allowing the陋习 of bargaining. Capitalists often only care about making profits and do not care about the lives of workers. It seems that it is rare to hear of the capital side automatically increasing workers' wages or giving annual awards, and the labor side feels the embarrassment of life and cannot help but change their minds on the wage side. When the labor side puts forward certain conditions, the capital side feels a headache, seemingly reasonable and unreasonable. When the workers take out the last weapon (strike), they have no choice but to comply with the authorities' call for negotiations and reluctantly concede. In this way, the capital side becomes a "candle," the labor side thinks it has won a victory, and an interest in 　　arises, so a wave of strikes arises 　　.</p>
<p>Improving labor welfare is indeed the only way to solve labor disputes, but do not unilaterally compromise. 对拿尽　体, Does not affect foreign investment, develop our country's industry, protect workers' welfare, and should be taken into account in all aspects. The spirit of the rule of law must be used to establish a good model, so that foreigners do not regard it as a dangerous path, and give people 口实, Affect the future of the nation.</p>
<p>In short, workers' representatives should not ask for excessive demands and get more and want more. Especially do not be greedy and use strikes as a threat at every turn, and do not deliberately encourage and incite labor disputes. Most workers with relatively naive knowledge will be overjoyed and echo when they hear that it will increase their income. They only know how to blindly follow strikes, but they do not know that labor and management must not be in an opposing position. They must cooperate sincerely and understand each other. This is the proper way to eliminate labor disputes and develop enterprises. (February 8)</p>
<h3>Like Vigorous Grass in a Gale, Like True Gold in a Raging Flame, Adding to the Glory of the National and Ethnic Personality: Chairman Chiang's Words of Encouragement to the Citizens of Shanghai</h3>
<p>After an absence of eight years, eight months, and twenty-five days, Chairman Chiang finally returned triumphantly to the East, reuniting with the elders and brethren of Jiangnan! If we are not forgetful, we should deeply believe that Chairman Chiang has always been concerned about the citizens of Shanghai. He once said, "Although I am separated from my Shanghai compatriots by thousands of miles, our spirits and voices are always connected." His current visit can give the citizens a deeper and more firm confidence. On the second anniversary of "August 13th," we solemnly recited with the most fervent hearts an important document that he proclaimed to us citizens, and even reading it today, our hearts are still moved.</p>
<p>Today, good and evil cannot coexist, and the loyal and treacherous cannot stand together.</p>
<p>What I ask of my Shanghai compatriots is to uphold righteousness, maintain personal integrity, never give up, and fight to the end.</p>
<p>Shanghai has a profound historical connection with China's reform movements of the past century, and even closer ties with the National Revolution. Since September 18th, our entire nation has been working hard for independence and self-reliance, strengthening national power. The economic, journalistic, academic, industrial, and other circles of Shanghai have made many contributions in various aspects. Shanghai compatriots must fulfill their historical mission in the history of China's independent nation-building.</p>
<p>Our Shanghai compatriots' enthusiasm in donating money and goods to support the front lines, their perseverance and struggle without fear of sacrifice, and their courageous acts of serving in the War of Resistance, have written countless moving and tragic histories, established the glory of the early stages of the War of Resistance, and inspired our final victory.</p>
<p>I hope that the cultural and journalistic circles of Shanghai will build a strong spiritual fortress. Based on this spirit, persevere and struggle, report correct news, and combat the fallacies of traitors. Every time they attempt to steal our righteous opinions, they will only expose their despicable and shamelessness to the people.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the location of an international market and has been a financial center for many years. I hope that the economic circles of Shanghai will unanimously strengthen their confidence, trust legal tender, and stabilize finance. As long as our people understand that supporting legal tender is an expression of patriotism, capital flight should be regarded as an act of treason and aiding the enemy. We must supervise and encourage each other.</p>
<p>I hope that the youth in Shanghai will work harder to motivate themselves, know shame and strive for self-improvement. They should also know that Shanghai, due to its convenient transportation, has much easier access to various research, advanced studies, books, and tools than the inland areas.</p>
<p>Our Shanghai workers must strengthen their unity, encourage each other, clearly distinguish right from wrong, strictly separate good from evil, endure hardship, and persevere to the end.</p>
<p>Hard work is our true character. The pain that general industrial and commercial countries consider unbearable, we can take in stride. Now that we are all in trouble together, we must promote the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation.</p>
<p>We especially cherish Shanghai's past contributions to our country, like vigorous grass in a gale, like true gold in a raging flame, supporting this difficult period to add to the glory of our country and national character! (From our newspaper's archives)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Triumphant Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang flew to Shanghai yesterday, a grand event that a million Shanghai citizens have been looking forward to day and night for the past eight years. Madame Chiang said that Shanghai is her hometown, but the citizens of Shanghai regard Chairman Chiang as their compassionate mother. The past eight years have been a critical time for our nation's survival, and also a period of suffering for the citizens of Shanghai, who were separated from their mother's embrace and subjected to the abuses of evil neighbors. Chairman Chiang's triumphant return to Shanghai, witnessing the hundred-year humiliation and eight-year occupation of Shanghai, now adorned with the national emblem of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, must be very gratifying. The joy of the Shanghai citizens in seeing Chairman Chiang's healthy and benevolent countenance is even more difficult to describe.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's return yesterday was a triumph. Reflecting on the pain, we cannot help but think of the wartime. The sound of cannons at Lugou Bridge was followed by the bloody battle of Shanghai on August 13th, which determined the start of the full-scale War of Resistance. The fate of the Chinese and Japanese nations was decided by the war in the past eight years. This eight-year war was the longest war in modern history, unprecedented since the Napoleonic Wars. We fought against Japan, a self-proclaimed first-class power, with a backward production and poorly equipped army. The hardship is self-evident. Moreover, the war was conducted over a long period. Those who couldn't endure it would have collapsed long ago. However, the reason why we were able to disregard these factors, persevere, and adhere to the principle of "responding to all changes with constancy," finally overcoming all kinds of difficulties, and achieving a glorious victory from the brink of destruction, is entirely due to our great eight-year war. It not only repelled the enemy, but also enabled us to achieve the goal of abolishing unequal treaties. Chairman Chiang is truly the savior of our nation! Now that the enemy has surrendered, and Chairman Chiang has won the victory, the citizens of Shanghai are naturally overjoyed and inspired. After an absence of eight years, Chairman Chiang has returned to his old place, reuniting with the elders and brethren of Jiangnan, and must also have a deep sense of joy.</p>
<p>Shanghai is China's first metropolis, the center of our national economy and finance, a vital base of the National Revolution, and a frontline fortress of the War of Resistance. After eight years of enemy ravage, although it has now been recovered, it is full of wounds. On the surface, it is still prosperous, but the people's livelihood is actually deepening day by day. Chairman Chiang cares about the people's suffering. During his tour of Beiping and Nanjing, he set up people's complaint boxes to receive people's opinions, which shows how much Chairman Chiang cares about the people's welfare. On this triumphant return to Shanghai, instead of writing a welcome speech praising his merits and virtues, we might as well represent the people and present the current hardships of the people's livelihood without any concealment. Chairman Chiang's great achievements are deeply imprinted in the hearts of every person, and there is no need for us to praise them. In the future, there will be historical pens to fully praise his abilities. What Chairman Chiang is deeply concerned about is not the praise for him personally, but the suffering of the people, especially the plight of the people in the recovered areas. The Shen Bao's relaunch had already stated that it bears the responsibility of reporting the people's plight, so we respectfully wish to present some aspects of the people's plight in the recovered areas to Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>First, the swift and severe punishment of traitors is the unanimous demand of the people in the recovered areas. The recovery of our homeland has been more than five months, but in fact, there are very few cases of traitors that have been quickly concluded and severely punished. Moreover, there are still a large number of traitors who are still at large. There may be some factors that prevent the widespread arrest of traitors and the prompt and severe punishment of traitor cases; but this will ultimately cause a negative impact on the people's psychology. Loyalty and treachery cannot coexist, and right and wrong must be distinguished. Today in Shanghai, there are inevitably people who were shameless in the enemy-puppet era, wagging their tails before the Japanese soldiers and bullying our compatriots. With a change of identity, they swagger and appear before us in another guise. These people should be arrested and severely punished immediately, and the government should have no dissent. Traitors who have been arrested and are under interrogation should be publicly and severely punished as soon as possible. More than five months have passed since the Japanese surrendered, but we have not yet seen the execution of important traitors. France's Pétain and Laval have already been publicly tried and convicted. Laval has been sentenced to death; Norway's Quisling has also been sentenced to death; Britain's "Lord Haw-Haw" and others have also been subjected to their due punishment. Even Yamashita Tomoyuki, known as the "Tiger of Malaya," has been sentenced to death. Why haven't our traitors, our Lavals, our Quislings, been punished according to the law of the land? In recent years, Chairman Chiang has vigorously promoted the New Life Movement, using "understanding propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame" to proclaim to the world. This is truly the foundation of nation-building. We believe that the swift and severe punishment of traitors is the best opportunity to make the people "understand propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame."</p>
<p>Second, since the recovery of Shanghai, there was initially competition among various parties for taking over, resulting in poor order. Then, materials were sealed up and could not be utilized, so that the operation of industry and commerce has not been flexible. Recently, in order to utilize the takeover of industries, various state-owned companies have emerged, even in light industry. All these measures were originally this . It has been our established national policy that heavy industry should be state-owned and light industry should be privately owned. The textile and silk companies that have been organized this time are light industries in nature, and private ownership would be more appropriate. However, the government has established large-scale state-owned companies at this time, which seems to be inconsistent with the principle of private ownership of light industry. How can it win the trust of the people? As for the numbers of the seized materials and their utilization, the government has not made a full public announcement. For the present, the government should quickly publish all the details of the takeover, so that the public can know.</p>
<p>Third, regarding the hardships of the people's livelihood, nothing is worse than the soaring prices. We know that Chairman Chiang has repeatedly ordered the relevant authorities to find ways to suppress and stabilize prices, but it is like speaking earnestly to those who turn a deaf ear. Administrative efficiency is not only slow but also clumsy. Many factories have been taken over, but they are allowed to remain closed. Many materials have been taken over, but they are allowed to rot. And when holding sales at reasonable prices, they must haggle over every penny, selling at 70% or 80% of the market price. When the market price rises, the reasonable price can never have the effect of suppressing prices. We have also never seen the relevant authorities come up with any concrete measures to make all factories resume operation and start work immediately, bringing back production. What is even more incomprehensible is that the main reason for the rising prices is speculation and the scourge of idle capital. The authorities only hold meetings to discuss how to curb speculation, absorb idle capital, and stabilize the value of the currency, but there is no real solution. They sit back and let the old Lunar New Year pass, gold prices jump wildly, and prices soar. The ordinary people are groaning on the verge of starvation! Chairman Chiang's triumphant return to Shanghai is at a time when prices are fluctuating violently. The five million citizens of Shanghai wish Chairman Chiang to exert his heroic judgment, punish the treacherous merchants who are speculating, and stabilize the soaring prices.</p>
<p>All things are reborn in spring! The citizens of Shanghai have groaned under the enemy-puppet rule for eight years. Now, with the triumphant return of Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang, all things are truly reborn in spring, bringing them warmth and joy.</p>

<h3>Xi Yushu Suggests Selling Shanghai's Gold Reserves at Official Prices; This Will Effectively Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, the prices of gold and goods in this city have been fluctuating drastically, which has had a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. This reporter visited National Assemblyman Xi Yushu, who told this reporter that the current surge in prices in Shanghai is worrying if effective measures are not taken. He telegraphed Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance about this matter, asking him to quickly sell Shanghai's gold reserves at the government's official price to stabilize prices, which is a readily available and relatively effective method. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>Readily Available and Relatively Effective</p>
<p>"(Omitted titles), Recently, the price of gold in Shanghai has been soaring, and all goods have been rising in succession. The livelihoods of ordinary people are severely threatened, and people are panicked, fearing that the situation cannot last. Although the labor strikes in various factories in this city have just been resolved, they are now being affected by prices again. The newly increased wages cannot keep up with prices, and I fear that they will recur as a result. If this continues, the hidden dangers to society are unimaginable. I understand that you are aware of all these situations. I believe that the current fluctuations in gold and commodity prices are caused by the long delay in determining foreign exchange rates, which has led to a flood of rumors and speculation by merchants who are fueling the flames. However, this matter concerns national policy and may not be convenient to announce at this time. Now, stabilizing prices requires comprehensive planning and concerted efforts to be effective. However, I believe that the immediately feasible and relatively effective method is to stabilize the price of gold. Therefore, I humbly suggest that you do what you can and coordinate the Ministry's position on gold and money. It seems that a prompt decision should be made to quickly sell the gold reserves seized from the enemy and puppets in Shanghai at the government-set gold price as much as possible. Or, gold can be transported from Chongqing to Shanghai, which can arrive in the evening if it departs in the morning. Such measures will immediately bring down the price of gold, and commodity prices will fall as a result, and people's hearts can be turned to peace, which is deeply beneficial to the country and society. I offer my shallow views for your consideration, and I hope you will make a wise decision."</p>
<h3>Regulating Food Supply, Selling Rice as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent sharp rise in rice prices, the food administration authorities stated that they are determined to make the greatest efforts to stabilize grain prices. In order to effectively suppress rice prices, the Food Administration Commissioner's Office is constantly selling rice to regulate the food supply. Yesterday, rice merchants in this city went to purchase rice, and it was very crowded. At the same time, large quantities of rice are arriving in Shanghai to replenish reserves. The authorities have decided to continue to implement the following policies regarding the food supply in the future: (1) Replenish grain sources from rice-producing areas. (2) Sell rice to regulate the food supply. (3) Strive to balance supply and demand and stabilize grain prices. Solve transportation problems and dredge sources.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Cuisine Industry Goes on Strike, Social Affairs Bureau Arbitrates</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau has drafted a solution to the Cantonese cuisine industry's strike. The decision will be sent to both labor and management today, ordering them to comply. If either party is dissatisfied, they may file an arbitration request with the municipal government within five days. The content of the decision is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Year-end bonuses are divided into three levels: 25,000, 20,000, and 15,000, to be paid within seven days. (2) The employer contributes 10% of the 20% gratuities, and 5% of the extra bonuses. The rest goes to the employees. (3) Wages are to be adjusted by each restaurant on its own. (4) The reinstatement of the dismissed employees of Meihua, Dadong, Sisister, and [some other place] will be decided later. If the above conditions are accepted by both parties, work should resume today.</p>
<h3>Power Company Labor Strike, Both Sides' Opinions Close</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Power Company's labor strike has undergone many twists and turns. Yesterday, under the joint mediation of Director Wu Kaixian and Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan of the Social Affairs Bureau, the opinions of both parties gradually became closer. Eight of the eleven conditions proposed by the labor side have been resolved yesterday. Only conditions one, two, and three remain to be discussed today. The management insists that company administration is not to be interfered with, while the labor side believes that if this cannot be achieved, their jobs will not be guaranteed, so they will not concede. Further frank discussions are needed today.</p>
<p>Also, the company will advance the payment of this month's salary tomorrow. The company has agreed to bear the medical expenses of those injured in the unfortunate incident last time. The Social Affairs Bureau also stated that it will thoroughly investigate the incident, expressed its gratitude to the workers for complying with the advice to resume work, and hopes that a quick solution can be reached as soon as possible to calm people's minds.</p>
<h3>Business Employees Make Four Demands</h3>
<p>The employees of the Shanghai Commercial Press have meager salaries and live in poverty. After adjusting salaries and allowances in January of this year, they are still only 14,000 to 15,000 yuan, which is difficult to maintain. Therefore, on the 10th of this month, they made four demands and again requested the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate fairly.</p>
<h3>Telegrams to Various Places in the United States Resume Acceptance</h3>
<p>The Western Union Telegraph Company of the United States previously suspended the acceptance of telegrams to various places in the United States, except for Washington, San Francisco, and New York, due to a labor strike. It is now reported that the company's labor strike has been resolved. The Ministry of Transportation's International Radio Station has resumed accepting international commercial telegrams to various places in the United States since yesterday. The previously ordered method of temporarily suspending the use of registered mail instead of the recipient's name and address has also been canceled.</p>
<h3>US Military Continues Trial of Japanese War Criminals, Fierce Debates on Both Sides, Court to Reconvene This Morning for Further Hearing</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The US military war crimes court held its fourth hearing at the Ward Road Prison at 9:00 AM yesterday, trying the eighteen Japanese war criminals who killed three US airmen in Hankou. The atmosphere in the courtroom yesterday was even more tense than before. In addition to the court officials and dozens of newspaper reporters and photographers, there were nearly a hundred spectators. Yesterday's hearing lasted for a total of seven hours and has not yet been completed. The defense lawyers on both sides argued fiercely.</p>
<p>Whether it is legal to try war criminals</p>
<p>After the court opened, the defendant's defense lawyer, Major Li Wen, stood up and argued that the US military authorities' establishment of a military court in China to try war criminals was an illegal move. The US government has already abolished extraterritoriality in China and has not occupied any land within China. At the same time, military courts can only be established by military governments. According to the law, the US military cannot organize a military government in China. The plaintiff's defense lawyer, Lieutenant Colonel West, immediately stated that the judicial power of a military government is not restricted by territory, nor is it restricted from trying war criminals. The authority to establish the US military court belongs to the US military commander in the China war zone, and the US military commander's establishment of this court is also ordered by the Joint Committee of the Pacific Theater. This situation is the same in the Philippines, Japan, or Germany. The Chinese government has the right to establish this court, but the defendant has no right to cancel it.</p>
<p>Major Li Wen argued again that the Chinese government did not say it wanted to establish a military court. If the US military commander is ordered by the Pacific Joint Committee to organize a military court, then this committee can also make mistakes. At this point, the presiding judge, Colonel Middleton, asked both sides to temporarily cease arguing and said that he would consider the opinions before making a decision. Colonel Middleton then named the Japanese war criminals one by one and asked if they were guilty. The eighteen war criminals loudly replied "Not guilty" one by one.</p>
<p>Four pieces of evidence presented in court</p>
<p>The lieutenant colonel then described the arrest of the three American pilots and their torture to death. The court announced a recess, and then continued the hearing after fifteen minutes. The plaintiff's defense counsel introduced Major Maunaga of the US Military War Crimes Tribunal to testify. Major Mao had previously investigated the case officially. West presented a total of four pieces of evidence, including a letter from the US government to the Swiss government, informing the Japanese government that it should abide by international law and not kill prisoners of war. There was also the entire report and testimony of US pilot Lieutenant Sheff. Lieutenant Sheff was arrested and tortured by the Japanese army with the three murdered American pilots, Lieutenant Hua Mai, Sergeant Forbes, and Sergeant Hui Den, but fortunately he was not killed.</p>
<p>Three Chinese testify in court</p>
<p>The plaintiff's defense counsel also introduced Tatsuta Sotjiro, a Japanese guard at the Hankou prisoner-of-war camp of the 134th Army, to testify, reporting on the situation of the American pilots being held in the prison, and that he himself had delivered food to them. At twelve o'clock, the court temporarily adjourned. At 1:30 PM, the interrogation of witnesses continued. There were also three people from Hankou, Yang Deyou, Song Wenqing, and Zhang Jiayuan, who were specially summoned to testify. They were translated by Captain Bosding of the American War Crimes Tribunal in Beiping, who was fluent in the Beiping dialect. Yang Deyou was a farmer living near the Japanese civilian crematorium in Hankou who witnessed the Japanese burning the three American pilots to death. Zhang Jiayuan was a gardener at the crematorium who was forced by the Japanese to light the fire to burn the three men to death. Later, the ashes of the three were secretly buried without telling anyone. It was not until recently that the US military authorities investigated the area and revealed the truth.</p>
<p>By this point, it was 5:15 PM, and Song Wenqing had not yet been questioned. The court announced that it would resume the hearing at 9:00 AM today.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Compatriots Return Home One After Another</h3>
<p>[United Press, this city] The president of the Taiwan Construction Association told a United Press reporter today that the Chinese citizens of Taiwan origin in China were subjected to oppression by the Japanese during the war. A portion has been sent back to Taiwan to start their new lives and are enthusiastically assisting in reconstruction work. The first batch of evacuees, a total of 1,816 people, were assisted by the US military's United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Chinese Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the Shanghai Repatriation Headquarters of the Third Route Army of China, and returned to Taiwan aboard the US transport ship "Loomis." There are currently several thousand people in Shanghai waiting to be repatriated. It is estimated that 6,000 Taiwanese will return home via Shanghai. This work has been delayed due to a lack of ships.</p>
<h3>Yu Rupin Appointed Commissioner of the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Yu Rupin, the chairman of the Shanghai Southern Goods Industry Association, worked hard for national salvation during the War of Resistance and was arrested and tortured by the enemy's military police. However, Mr. Yu's will was firm and he remained unmoved. It is now heard that Wu Kaixian, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, has appointed Mr. Yu as a commissioner of the bureau.</p>
<h3>Repatriating Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>Japanese residents and prisoners in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places, as well as those in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, except for a very small number of technicians who are temporarily requisitioned by various agencies, are all concentrated in Shanghai, awaiting ships to return home. There are approximately 80,000 Japanese residents in the Nanjing area, who are about to be completely repatriated. The Shanghai-Hangzhou line has relatively few means of transportation, so the Railway Bureau allows 500 Japanese prisoners of war to be transported to Shanghai for concentration every day. Currently, approximately 6,000 Japanese prisoners of war set sail from Shanghai every day to return home. According to US military authorities, 100 Liberty ships and multiple landing craft will be allocated for use in the near future. At that time, 25,000 Japanese residents can be repatriated every day.</p>

<h3>Zhou Family Residence on Wuxing Road: A Major Bloodshed Incident Occurred the Night Before Last; Three Victims: a Red Dance Girl, Her Mother and Younger Brother; The Murderer Committed Suicide by Shooting Himself After the Incident</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A major bloodshed incident involving the shooting of four men and women occurred suddenly at midnight the night before last at No. 3, Block C, Zhou Family Residence, No. 517, Wuxing Road, West Shanghai. The victims were a red dance girl, her mother, and her younger brother. The murderer also committed suicide by shooting himself after committing the crime. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Xinhua, from Hebei, age 26, formerly the captain of the "puppet organization Finance Minister" Zhou Fohai's puppet guard, is currently employed at the Sino-American Cooperative. In his spare time, he frequents theaters and dance halls, and he has formed an inextricable bond with Wu Jieying (age 21), a red dance girl at the Xinhua Dance Hall.</p>
<p>A Deep Bond</p>
<p>Their affection grew ever stronger, and they established a "golden house" in an apartment on Hualong Road. Two months ago, Zhang began living at No. 3, Block C, Zhou Residence on Wuxing Road, West Shanghai. Wu's mother, Ai Zhu (age 46), and her younger brother, Wu Jiexin (age 21), both lived at No. 17 Mikang Lane on Linsen Road. Her father, Hanqing, works as a barber at the Lujiawan Precinct. At around 7:00 PM yesterday evening, Jieying, along with her mother and younger brother, went to the office of the Sino-American Cooperative at No. 262 Hunan Road to invite Zhang out to return to their Wuxing Road residence to discuss and resolve</p>
<p>marriage issues. Around 11:30 PM, multiple gunshots were suddenly heard from inside the house. Shao, a student living in the same residence (and a colleague of Zhang), heard the gunshots and opened the door to investigate. He saw Wu Aizhu, with a bullet penetrating her right ear and exiting the back of her head; Jieying, with a bullet in her lip and a hole in her left leg; and Jiexin, with a bullet entering his left ear and exiting his right temple. Xinhua was shot in his right temple, with the bullet exiting his left temple. All were lying in pools of blood, a truly tragic sight. Because it was late at night, the incident was not reported to the Changshu Precinct until around 7:00 AM. Zhang Canguang, the head of the judicial section, led a large group of police officers to the scene to investigate. They found four bodies lying horizontally in the room,</p>
<p>blood coagulated all over the floor. They found two handguns: one with six bullets still in the chamber, and the other with six of the seven bullets spent. Afterwards, according to reporters' investigation, the cause of the tragedy is said to be related to a love affair. Because Zhang was running out of money, Jieying intended to seek another partner. The old woman Aizhu threatened to report Zhang's traitorous and harmful deeds. The negotiations the night before were likely about Jieying's intention to end the cohabitation relationship, leading to this enormous bloodshed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fugitive Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Report] On the 7th of this month, a prison break occurred at the detention center of the Shanghai Local Court on North Zhejiang Road. Apart from the Korean Shin Jeong-gyun, who was captured on the spot, the remaining two Japanese and one Chinese fugitive escaped without a trace. After Wu, the acting director of the center, worked with the North Railway Station Precinct to conduct a vigorous search, the Japanese fugitive Wei Ming was captured yesterday. The police department has handed him over to the prosecutor's office of the local court. The other two fugitives are still at large, and no clues have yet been obtained.</p>
<h3>Shipwreck; Bodies Recovered and Transported</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Enterprise Company's chartered China Merchants Bureau No. 109 motorized sailboat (formerly known as "Kitamaru") wrecked at sea. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to the company's news, five bodies recovered from the sea off Zhoushan have now been transported to Longgang. Among them, in addition to Zhang Minyuan of the Jinjiang Tai Customs Brokerage, Zhao Zhenmin, the chief clerk of the company, was also identified by a gold ring he was wearing on his hand. Yesterday, Captain Xu of Bailonggang sent someone to deliver it. Therefore, there is no doubt that the ship has sunk. The company plans to send personnel to Bailonggang today to identify the corpses. They are currently discussing the aftermath with the families of the victims.</p>
<p>Sea Surface Often Has Hurricanes</p>
<p>The sea surface weather has been unstable recently, with frequent hurricanes.

<h3>Plaintiffs and Defendants Made Their Own Statements; Li Ze Retried Yesterday; The Court Ordered Both Parties to Submit More Evidence if Possible</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Li Ze case was retried yesterday. The defendant's defense lawyer presented various pieces of evidence, and the plaintiff also made a statement. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The case was carefully questioned by Chief Judge Liu Yugui, along with two judges, Cao Jun and Zhu Zonghai, and prosecutors and clerks in a collegial panel. Both lawyers, Zhang Shijian and Chen Tingrui, who were hired by the defendant, appeared in court. After Li Ze was brought to the court, Chief Judge Liu ordered the clerk to read the record of the defendant's previous statement and asked Li Ze</p>
<p>whether there were any errors. Li immediately said there were two points: (1) The puppet commodity control association did not have a chairman system, but a director system. (2) The price of the pig iron sold to the Sendai Iron Factory was 5,600 yuan of puppet currency per picul, not per catty. Then, Attorney Chen stood up to defend, stating five points: (1) Regarding the sale of pig iron, the prosecutor claimed that the free transfer of metal products was prohibited at that time, but the investigation showed that internal movement within the city was not restricted. This is evidenced by the "News Daily" in October 1944, which was full of</p>
<p>advertisements for the sale of scrap iron. (2) Not only did the Xinxin Company sell pig iron to the Sendia Iron Factory, but in September 1944, two other companies, Dingfeng and others, also sold pig iron to Sendia. (3) At that time, the payment method of Sendia was to use appropriation orders in three batches. As there was a surplus, there were check stubs of Xinxin returning the balance. (4) Li has helped the underground work, which can be proved by the certificate of the Shanghai Representative Office of the Military Commission. (5) The defendant has subsidized a large amount of military expenses to the loyal rescue army. At this point, the court ordered the clerk to read the previous statement records of the accusers and asked Shu Yueqiao and others if there were any errors. Shu said it was correct, but added three points: (1) Li claimed that he was forced to serve as a director of the Puppet Chamber of Commerce. This is to justify himself. (2) The employment of Japanese consultants was said by Li to be in response to the situation at that time, but this was Li's own desire to contact the enemy. (3) Li claimed to have helped the underground work, why did he not declare it in the police bureau and the prosecutor's investigation court earlier, but did not raise it until the last court session, which is suspicious. In addition, other accusers, Han Wucheng, Ye Qiubin, and others, stated that the Xinxin Company evaded taxes and sold Japanese goods before the war, and was therefore</p>
<p>punished by the authorities. At this point, Li immediately defended his own actions of comforting the national army, helping to rescue and repatriate refugees, and rescuing underground workers Lin Yaopo, the leader of the New Capital Hotel, and Xinxin employees Wang Zhihong, Chen Baozhang, Wang Qiuyue, and US military communications officer Huang Ruitang after the Shanghai War. He had also donated 77 million yuan in puppet currency to Yang Hailin's loyal rescue army in Pudong; organized a group to supply the national army with materials with Guo Shun and others; and was ordered to rescue materials during the Allied bombing of Shanghai, all of which can be verified by the Military Control Bureau of the Third Theater Command and other agencies.</p>
<p>Investigations and certifications finally stated that if he had done anything harmful or evil during his tenure as a director of the Puppet Merchant Chamber of Commerce, he would willingly accept legal sanctions. The court then questioned Yang Shenrui, the accountant of the Xinxin Company, Han Zhiyun, the manager of the Sendai Iron Factory, and the manager of the Xinda Bank, which had dealings with the Xinxin Company, and reviewed the accounts of the sale of pig iron. Chief Judge Liu questioned Li because there were two receipts in which</p>
<p>signatures did not match. Li said that the signatures were usually the responsibility of himself, his brother, and Deputy Manager Xiao. The accusers, Shu Yueqiao and others, believed that there were suspicious points in this, and both parties held different opinions. Lawyer Chen Tingrui then requested that the court appoint an accountant to investigate all accounts with the accountant of the Xinxin Company, which was the most fair way. At this point, the court ordered both parties to collect evidence within one week and wait until 2:30 PM on the 18th to open the court for investigation again.</p>
<p>Interrogation of Witnesses in Three Traitor Cases</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, three other traitor cases were heard: (1) Zhang Qipin, who manufactured洋釘 (a type of nail) for the enemy, was questioned by the witness Hou Wenbin. (2) Gu Youtang, who recruited workers for the enemy, was questioned by the witness Shimazaki Seizo, a Japanese national. (3) Yin Ziming, the captain of the Qingpu County puppet security brigade, was hated by Ma Jiwu, a loyal rescue army cadre, for instigating his subordinates to revolt, and looted all of Ma's property. Ma then reported the incident and filed a civil suit to recover the losses. Because the bandit is on the run, the court ordered that the cases be retried when they are arrested. Also, the Gan Deyun case will be sentenced this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Reality: Machinery and Other Items Cannot Come Suddenly</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the restoration, many domestic industrial circles have ordered textile machinery and other machinery from the United States. However, it is said that new machinery will not be easily shipped to China in the short term, because it must be given priority to markets such as the United Kingdom. Similarly, other materials, such as certain raw materials, also have considerable reservations. For example, several batches of pigments ordered by this port have been ordered, but people in the same industry recently received calls saying that the quantity must be greatly reduced and the price must be increased. Those that can be shipped to China smoothly are still general consumer goods. According to a certain importer and exporter yesterday, since the exchange rate has not been determined, its import and export business is still limited to barter trade, and it is not easy to develop for a while.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Trade Union Hosts Various Newspaper Authorities Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Newspaper Trade Union held a tea party for the heads of various newspapers at the Central Vegetable Club on Fourth Malu at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The following were present: Zhan Wenhufu of the "News Daily"; Chen Xun of the "Shen Bao," represented by Tu Jinceng; Xu Yaqian of the "Zhengyan Daily"; Xu Xigao of the "Central Daily"; Xu Tongfu and Xiao Xiuqing of the "Wenluo Daily"; Guan Jian of the "Republican Daily"; Liu Hanwen of the "China-America Daily"; Zhuang Zhiliang of the "Current Affairs News," represented by Zhu Xiansheng and Zhou Cengzuo; Xing Songwen of the "Frontline Daily"; Ma Jun of the "Fuzhou Daily"; Yao Sufen of the "World Morning Post"; Gu Ming of the "Zheng Bao"; and all the executive directors of the union. During the meeting, a preliminary exchange of views was held on issues such as salary adjustments in the industry. In the spirit of labor-management agreement, the results were extremely harmonious.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Speculation Group Suffers a Head-on Blow; Gold Price Plummets by 100,000; US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars Also Follow the Drop</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the fragile minds of speculators were unsettled by the news of Chairman Chiang's arrival in Shanghai, showing some concern. Silver and money businesses contracted their lending one after another, and credit became extraordinarily tight. The bulls were slaughtered endlessly. With supply exceeding demand, the price drop was severe. It was even worse near noon. Although the opening price in the morning was 1.39 million, the long positions from the previous week were frightened by the news of Chairman Chiang's arrival in Shanghai, and they scrambled to sell, causing the price to fall all the way to below 1.29 million before it stabilized. Jewelers bought in at the low price, and the price recovered to 1.32 million and then entered a consolidation. Unfortunately, the recovery was only a fleeting moment, and the downward trend had already been established. The long positions were unable to stabilize their footing and began to cut their losses. The "ten-day" loans needed to be repaid, and the silver and money businesses were also concerned about new loans due to the environment and were unwilling to comply. The arrogant speculators were now crestfallen. The price drop resumed near noon, and at noon it even fell to below 1.22 million before recovering slightly. The final transaction price was about 1.24 million, a massive drop of 100,000 compared to last Saturday. The next-day delivery price rose from 1.25 million to 1.27 million in the afternoon. Banks from Sichuan were eager to sell their shares, jewelers' workers went on strike, and there were rumors that gold and silver jewelry stores were unwilling to buy in. The price fell again to 1.15 million. Gold jewelry in jewelers' shops was reduced to 126,000, silver to 1,300, and silver dollars to 780. The interest rate for clearings was from 1.2 to 1.8, and finally 1.6.</p>
<p>Although the US dollar was affected by the gold market, it also suffered a severe drop. However, because the speculative atmosphere was weaker, and there were no long positions standing, although it fell, it was not as severe as gold. The swap price shrank from about 720 yuan to about 690 yuan. In the afternoon, there were rumors that it would be pegged at 2,000 to 1, and it rose from 178 to 1,820. In the blink of an eye, the gold market plummeted, and the US dollar inevitably followed the downward trend, finally settling at around 1,750 yuan. The swap head also squeezed closer to 650 yuan per 10 taels, a drop of 150 yuan compared to last Saturday. Although old Hong Kong dollars were slightly affected, banks were buying, and they were very stable. New Hong Kong dollars ended at a low price. As a result, old Hong Kong dollars fell by 30 yuan, and new Hong Kong dollars fell by 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>"Ban on Speculation" News Spreads Fear; Stock Prices All Show Low Prices</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were also unfavorable due to the environment and lacked new stimuli. Under the panic of the long positions, supply exceeded demand. Yong Yarn fell from 2,680 yuan, Meiya from 2,060 yuan, and Jingfu from 138 yuan, falling all the way. Although there were struggles in the middle, the closing price at noon was still low. Compared to last Saturday, Yong Yarn and Meiya each fell by more than 400 yuan, Jingfu fell by 22 yuan, Qinxing by 24 yuan, and Xinguang by 25 yuan. The remaining unpopular stocks also followed the decline by about 10% to 20%. After the close, due to the news of a ban on speculation, the asking price continued to decline.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks saw a small setback as soon as they opened in the morning. Lacking a main buyer, sellers were eager to unload their shares. At noon, they all closed at low prices and sell-offs, falling 10% to 20% compared to last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Plummet; Internal Unification Bonds a Little Over 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>Government bonds plummeted yesterday because the reports said that the proceeds from the internal unification (統) A bonds must wait until there is a surplus in customs duties before they can be repaid, and other foreign debts would be paid by the central government first. Long positions' expectations were disappointed again, and they rushed to settle, and people were quite panicked. Category C was still stable at the beginning, but the sellers were eager to sell, and the price fell all the way from 2,220 yuan. Although there were several fluctuations in the middle, individual investors were panicked, and large firms in the industry were unable to do anything due to the tight credit. At noon, they all closed at low prices. Category C broke seven barriers in a row and closed at a sell price of 1,600 yuan, a massive drop of 600 yuan compared to last Saturday. Category A and B fell by 270 yuan, Category D fell by 170 yuan, and Category E fell by 280 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Calm</h3>
<p>The market turned calm yesterday, as the sudden drop in the price of gold softened the minds of the people. 16-count Bright yarn traded at 689,000, mostly by fellow traders. 20-count Blue Phoenix at 760,000, and Special Double Horse at 930,000, supply and sale were available, but buying interest was dampened by the decline in pure gold. Overall, 20-count yarn fell by 120,000 yuan, and the price of 40-count single yarn and 42-count Blue Phoenix thread were still stable, rising slightly compared to the end of last week.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Sales Brisk; Price Rises Again Compared to Last Week</h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading was very brisk yesterday, and market prices were frequently rising. Purchases by the China Textile Construction Company were still concentrated, mostly raw materials such as 42-count and 32-count fine velvet. The transaction volume of coarse velvet was not large, and the price rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<h3>New Woolen Cloth Transactions Limited</h3>
<p>The woolen cloth transactions have been scattered and sporadic, wholesale and retail sales are limited. This is because the opening price of the紅盤(good luck) is expensive, the firms purchased a considerable amount last month, and it is still early to determine whether spring sales will be smooth. As a result, the buying group in this street and other buyers are waiting and watching. The situation at the Public Tea Association is far less prosperous than in previous years. The same trade is still following the old practice, closing early before the Lantern Festival.</p>
<h3>Speculative Transactions Contract; Silk Prices Are Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for rayon maintained the original plate from Saturday. The lowest asking price for 120-count Tianqiao spot goods was 1.75 million yuan, and the final asking price was 1.8 million yuan. Factory sales were sluggish, and there were no transactions in the spot market. The warehouse list traded at 1.17 million yuan in the morning and 1.19 million yuan in the afternoon. The price of 120-count miscellaneous brands was lower, 100,000 yuan shorter than Tianqiao. Factory sales prices were slightly shorter than on Saturday due to the impact of the drop in gold prices. However, intermediate-level another ancestors are searched for because they had a strong base. Holders are unwilling to sell cheaply. The price of silk goods, Dashun Gebi crepe, fell sharply. Compared with Saturday, each code was 200 yuan shorter. Meiya bedding fell by 20,000 yuan per 100 pieces. People's minds are soft, and transactions are slack.</p>
<h3>Tea Prices Increase Step by Step; Taiwan Tea Has Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Taiwan red and green tea, which has been out of stock for a long time, has reportedly arrived in Shanghai in more than 1,000 boxes. The quality is good and will be on the market soon. As for the tea market situation in this city, it is still riding the rising trend of the past week. In addition, the buying interest is strong, and the hoarding mentality of the cargo party is intensifying, resulting in prices rising step by step. For example, the top green jasmine flower has broken through the 300,000 yuan mark per ancestor. Other colors are also tracking upward. Looking at the current situation, actual sales are not decreasing, and the inventory in the market is few and far between, and the demand is far greater than the supply, because the tea production season is still far away. The future looks very optimistic.</p>
<h3>Sugar List Prices Increase Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Public Association for Sugar continued to list for sale, and prices increased slightly. The list price for both No. 22 medium sand white must be combined with No. 18 medium sand white at 20%, the price were both 48,000 yuan, an increase of 2,000 yuan, raw sand red 55,000 yuan, and green sugar 33,000 yuan, an increase of 3,000 yuan, with a total of more than 7,000 pieces. The opening prices for customers and goods are slightly set, medium sand white 51,200 yuan, with lack of transactions because there were fewer households.</p>
<h3>New Banknotes Arrive in Shanghai: 4,000 Boxes Shipped From the United States</h3>
<p>A large number of banknotes arrived in Shanghai, loaded on the British ship "Italy Willow" of辦托司(trusteeship)号(number), a total of four thousand and twenty-one boxes, loaded from New York. They are banknotes of the Central Bank. The banknotes must be stamped before they can be issued. There is also a sample box.</p>
<h3>Price of Level-Priced Rice Increased; Rice Market Looks More Bullish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, all goods softened, but rice prices saw a more attractive show of strength. The level-priced rice of the Grain Administration Bureau also increased in price with the market, making people's hearts firmer.粳(Jing) and秈(Xian) rice and白元(Baiyuan) were increased by 3-500 yuan. Yellow beans were 100-plus yuan tired and the bean cakes were also average. Flour came back to a small 100-200 yuan. The oil market has Qingdao raw oil for sale, turning the store’s stomach into inert, raw oil a small 2-3,000 yuan, and soy oil a small 1,000-plus yuan.</p>
<h3>Golden Vegetable Again Breaks New High Price</h3>
<p>The market price of daylily is already high, but the price will continue to be high as the customer sales are not lonely. If the goods from the upper and middle estates rise another 10%, it will be opened to 140,000 yuan, and high goods are added according to the photos, and the trend is strong, which is rare in history.</p>
<h3>The Coal Market's Rising Trend Gradually Slows; Confiscated Anthracite Coal Expected to Be Released; Shipments from Other Ports Arrive in Steady Streams</h3>
<p>Merchants dealing in anthracite coal dust, whose goods were previously confiscated at the McGinlay Road Station, have now received an order from the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Considering their lack of familiarity with the new regulations, they are permitted to truthfully report their goods, which will be released after verification. As a result, the spot market's supply has visibly eased. It is also reported that the Fuel Management Bureau, due to the recent increase in anthracite coal arrivals, will organize a sale at fixed prices, bringing relief to the public. Various households are frequently selling at high prices, and the upward trend is gradually easing. However, anthracite coal lumps are still in short supply, causing their market price to rise. As for bituminous coal, due to low reserves in various other ports, procurement and transportation must be approved by the Fuel Management Bureau and cannot be handled privately, leading to a reduction in arrivals. Although the responsibility for supplying low-priced bituminous coal for civilian use has been divided among different districts, the quantities are meager, and there is no opportunity for turnover purchases. Consequently, sellers' asking prices are becoming increasingly tight, but actual sales are normal, and prices are not rising sharply.</p>
<p>Further news: After the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Fuel Committee regulated and streamlined fuel sources in the city, the situation has gradually improved, with shipments arriving in steady succession.

<h3>British and American Cultural Foundations: Only Existing Funds, No New Income; Progress Hampered During the War</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing] The British Boxer Indemnity Refund Board has now been renamed the "China-Britain Cultural Fund Board," with Minister Zhu Jiahua continuing to serve as chairman and Vice-Minister Hang Liwu as director-general. The Board has no new income and relies solely on existing funds to maintain its operations. Currently, the China Geographical Research Institute, the China Sericulture Research Institute, and the Art Academy, all established in Chongqing, are the Board's supplementary research projects. Once the national government returns to the capital, the Board and its affiliated research institutions will relocate to Nanjing to resume their work.</p>
<p>Similarly, the China-US Educational and Cultural Fund Board has also suffered from a lack of American funds. Although it maintained a Shanghai office in the American Citibank Building on the Bund during the war, progress was limited. The head office in Chongqing, relying on existing funds, provides partial subsidies and awards to academic research in the inland southwestern provinces. A majority of the Board's members, such as Dr. Shi Zhaoji and Dr. Meng Lu, are currently in the United States. (The board is comprised of fifteen members in total). It is anticipated that once the national government returns to the capital, the Chinese and American members will come to China one after another to convene an annual meeting and further discuss the Board's future development.

<h3>Recent News from the National Southwestern Associated University (Lianda): Peking and Tsinghua Universities to Continue Joint Operations After Relocation to Beiping; Nankai University Decides to Independently Recruit New Students After Relocation to Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kunming, 10th of this month] After the National Southwestern Associated University (Lianda) returns to Beiping and Tianjin in May or June of this year, Peking University and Tsinghua University will continue to operate jointly for one to two years.

<h3>Old Beyond One's Years</h3>
<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Older people often have a certain expectation of younger people. This expectation is almost invariably "old beyond one's years"!</p>
<p>So-called "old beyond one's years" is not just "precocious," but also "prematurely aged."</p>
<p>To understand worldly affairs and human relationships earlier, to imitate the cunning and treacherousness of seasoned schemers sooner, to grasp the art of advancing and retreating sooner, to learn to be hypocritical and perfunctory sooner.</p>
<p>As a result, you see a society filled with a group of "little old men" who are old before their time! Based on their age, they should be full of vigor, liveliness, innocence, and purity. They should possess some courage and righteousness, and they should "fire off" a few times and show some "childishness"!</p>
<p>But they have conformed. They have already put on the shackles of "old age," they have already crossed "youth" and stepped into the other end of life—"old age." They follow older people in talking old talk, putting on old airs, and acting old. They are already like coal ash that has been burned by a boiler, unable to ignite the fire of life.</p>
<p>Professor Cole gave us a sentence: "If this stage is not mature, don't even think about the next stage developing." Not allowing young cells to reproduce to their capacity is a "dry" life.</p>
<p>We are not opposed to the cultivation that young people should have, the knowledge they should possess, and the breadth of mind they should develop, but these are not to tell us to skip this stage and recite "old age scriptures."</p>
<p>What is "old age"?</p>
<p>Old age is answering "accordingly" to an "etcetera."</p>
<p>Old age is not opening one's mouth, or even opening one's eyes.</p>
<p>Old age is nodding as much as possible!</p>
<p>Old age is expressing "I never eat meat!" if the host brings out tofu.</p>
<p>Old age is wearing earmuffs in the right ear and stuffing cotton in the left ear.</p>
<p>Old age is wearing a patched cotton robe and stuffing gold bars into one's socks.</p>
<p>Old age is saying "ha ha ha" to the sun and calling out to "Heaven" whenever it rains!</p>
<p>Old age is killing one's friend and sending a "condolence gift."</p>
<p>My friends, I would rather you be seen as "childish" than have the "taste of old age." Today, lies and hypocrisy have already occupied every corner of the universe; there is no need for you to enrich their ranks.</p>
<p>"Always preserve your youth, truth, and passion!"</p>
<p>Please remember Goethe's words!</p>

<h3>Explanation of "Party"</h3>
<p>— Peng Yao</p>
<p>The word "party" is not a bad word. It seems that Mr. Zhang Shenfu had a bit of a misunderstanding in the Political Consultative Conference regarding the explanation of the word "party."</p>
<p>He said: "The party has nearly harmed China. Chinese people do not like it. There is an ancient saying that a gentleman is social but not partisan, and from the meaning of the word, 'party' is about valuing darkness, which is liking darkness." As soon as these words were spoken, those without parties or factions smiled at each other. As a result, some newspapers said that this was a profound statement. In fact, the meaning of the word is not explained this way. He was completely taking the literal meaning and speaking nonsense, attacking the dark parts of any party is okay, but to discuss a party based on the character itself, he has really committed the mistake of glossing over words!</p>
<p>According to the Shuowen Jiezi [a Chinese dictionary from the Han Dynasty], "party" means "not distinct, from valuing darkness." It means the multitude. Darkness means the common people, the black-haired people. In ancient times, the common people tied black cloth around their heads to distinguish themselves from officials and scholars. Valuing means respecting. Mozi's chapters on "Valuing Agreement" and "Valuing Talent" can attest to this. Valuing darkness should mean respecting the common people, which is a footnote to "the people are the most important" and a symbol of "democracy." The common people are many, how can a party be separated from the people? This is the deep meaning of the ancients in creating the word.</p>
<p>Let us look at another dictionary, the Shiming, which also says, "Five hundred families form a party, the head of the party is also a respected elder in a gathering." They never looked down on the party. Yang Xiong's Fangyan [a collection of regional words and dialects] says: "Party, understanding, philosopher, knowing. The people of Chu call it party, or understanding; the people between Qi and Lai call it philosopher." The common saying now is "to understand, to know," "to understand" is "party," originally an ancient sound, but dialects are different. Since one establishes a party, one should understand the psychology of the people, know the suffering of the people, in order to represent the people's voices, and raise legitimate demands. It is not that one can form a party in a confused way and call oneself the head of a certain party.</p>
<p>"Party" has a meaning of beauty and goodness, recorded in both the Guangyun and Guangya [dictionaries], which is praised by the general public, and there are no words of disparagement or contempt. The reason why there are "gentlemen do not form parties" and other taunts of "cliques" is only because they have the behavior of forming cliques for personal gain or planting parties for private purposes, and only then is there this occasional argument, which is not to be completely denied. This has an explanation in dialectics and logic. How can one call a deer a horse and make something out of nothing?</p>
<p>In the Han Dynasty, the party of confinement, in the Tang Dynasty, Niu (Sengru) Li (Deyu), in the Song Dynasty, the Luoshuo Shuo, and in the Ming Dynasty, the Donglin and non-Donglin, their party members had gentlemen and villains, which cannot be generalized. Confucius was born in an era of monarchical autocracy, holding the policy of "the people can be made to follow, but not made to know," advocating the spirit of "when the state is well-governed, scholars and commoners do not discuss," this kind of view is of course not suitable for today's democratic freedom, and the prevalence of party politics. Criticizing today's political parties and revolutionary parties with the old-fashioned words of "gentlemen do not form parties" is an anachronism and an inappropriate analogy.</p>
<p>Looking at the facts again, Mr. Shao Lizi replied well: "If there was no Tongmenghui [United League], the Qing government could not have been overthrown; if there was no reorganization of the Kuomintang in the thirteenth year of the Republic [1924], the Northern Warlords could not have been overthrown; and if there was no leadership of the Kuomintang in the eight years of resistance against Japan, China today would not know what it would have become. Since the Great War, all countries in the world have suffered, let alone China, which was the first to resist Japan and suffered the most? At present, the country is in distress, we should reflect on ourselves, but to say that it is harmed by the party is absolutely unfair." It is truly an unbreakable famous saying.</p>
<p>We do not hate parties, and we are willing to join parties with political views and actions, engage in bright struggles, and do not want to see meaningless sabotage. A party is light, not darkness. A party is the people are the most important, not the sharing of spoils among a few. This is a natural law, and it is hoped that the gentlemen who run any party will understand it. Separated from the masses, without "valuing darkness," there is no party. Relying solely on opportunities to form a party and blocking justice to call out, that is without the foundation of a party, how can one talk about a party?</p>
<p>Municipal Politics</p>
<h3>From Land Consolidation to Usage</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau's commencement of land registry consolidation and ownership registration has brought land issues back into public discourse.</p>
<p>Why is land consolidation necessary? How should it be carried out? Is the completion of land consolidation considered the ultimate goal?</p>
<p>The urgency of land consolidation is akin to that of census clarification, and its importance may even surpass it. Without accurate statistics for the entire land area, all production and construction plans become baseless fantasies. Unfortunately, in our "so-so" nation, everything is "so-so," and land registry is a complete mess. Take Shanghai as an example. The land value in Shanghai undoubtedly ranks first in the country, yet its land registry is fragmented. For instance, property owners' certificates include pre-Qing Dynasty square deeds, perpetual leases with foreign firm names (also known as Dao Deeds), land ownership certificates issued by the Land Bureau, small corner remnants of title deeds, partition deeds issued by bank trust company real estate departments, and even some who possess large plots of land without any proof whatsoever. Conversely, there are also many who hold land certificates but whose land has long been used for roads due to road construction. Imagine the state of affairs when so many types of documents originate from various organizations and span long periods! Shanghai is like this; rural areas are even worse. Failure to consolidate land registries has far-reaching implications on the entire national economic policy, hindering accurate estimation of overall productive capacity. In the short term, it easily breeds disputes and conflicts. Relying solely on the memory of the "Bao Zheng" (local security chief) to manage complex land situations according to Chinese customs naturally leads to errors.</p>
<p>The most important step in land consolidation is land surveying. Once the land surveying is completed, and cadastral maps are drawn up, public announcements are made for people to register, identify boundaries, and confirm ownership. From the individual perspective, property rights are guaranteed permanently, and from the collective perspective, the clarification of land registry begins.</p>
<p>Land registry consolidation in Shanghai started early, but it was hindered by the presence of foreign concessions, further complicated by unequal treaties that required recognizing perpetual leases issued by foreign firms. Since the enemy's occupation, the land registry has inevitably fallen into further chaos. This time, the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau's undertaking of land registry consolidation is among the first in recovered urban areas, and its work is undoubtedly crucial and immense.</p>
<p>However, land registry consolidation, while a vital part of land work, is only a part. Land consolidation is merely a means, while the goal of land work is to fully utilize land and achieve the principle of equalizing land ownership in the People's Livelihood. People often mistakenly believe that land registry consolidation marks the end of land administration, but it is merely the first step. For example, land prices in Shanghai naturally rise daily with the city's prosperity, and speculative merchants treat land as a commodity, preferring to see it lie barren, waiting for its value to soar. Those who research soil improvement, suitable agricultural products, or plan other municipal improvements to rationalize land use and increase its value are rare. Once land registry consolidation is completed, the second step can begin: fully utilizing the land and implementing Sun Yat-sen's principle of equal land rights.</p>
<p>Land consolidation is merely a means, while land utilization is our goal. The first step should be as swift as possible, and land utilization should be studied as thoroughly as possible. Because the land issue is related to the entire nation's economic lifeline and every individual's immediate interests, the state must take responsibility for promoting land work, and every citizen has an unavoidable duty to assist!</p>

<h3>Radar for the Blind</h3>
<p>— Zhong Mao</p>
<p>The blind will soon be able to use an electrical device that prevents them from colliding with obstacles while walking. The device is a small box that emits a narrow beam of light, and by rotating this beam, the blind person can know the path to take. When the light beam hits telephone poles, fences, houses, or other obstacles, it is immediately reflected onto a lens on the box, then focused onto a photocell, causing a buzzing sound in the earpiece, indicating an obstacle ahead. The blind person can tell the distance between themselves and the obstacle from the length of the buzzing sound.</p>
<p>However, to avoid inaccurate signals caused by sunlight or artificial light, the light beam emitted by the small box, like the radio waves emitted by military radar transmitters, is intermittent, and the photocell is not sensitive to continuous light.</p>
<p>Currently, the device weighs only nine pounds, making it very convenient to carry.</p>

<h3>Reader's Letter Vividly Depicts the Situation, Requesting Police Authorities to Eliminate Three Evils: Pickpockets, Thugs, and Drug Dealers Plaguing the People Deeply. Secret Investigation, Arrest, Strict Punishment, and Thorough Elimination of Evil</h3>
<p>Editor: The mysterious darkness of Shanghai is everywhere. Based on what I know, I request you to publish this in your newspaper to urge the wise authorities to eradicate it as soon as possible for the benefit of the people. (1) A large number of pickpockets, reportedly over a hundred, are lurking in Fujian Road, Guangdong Road, and the surrounding alleys. Their leader is said to be dressed in a suit and tie, appearing like a boss or young master, renting rooms to direct his accomplices and dividing the spoils on the spot. If an accomplice is arrested, the leader uses his extensive connections to secure their release, often within a few hours, or at most a day or two. Consequently, the pickpockets act boldly, and the suffering of the victims is imaginable. The people living there dare not speak out for fear of retaliation. (2) Gangsters gather at the wharves along the Huangpu River, threatening merchants and travelers carrying goods onto ships. These merchants and travelers are weak and unable to resist. To avoid immediate losses, they pay protection money and have to say nice things. Although there are public officials at the wharves, they turn a blind eye and deaf ear. The victims have to swallow their anger and have no recourse. (3) During the enemy-puppet regime, a Korean living in the Yude Lane on Old Granary Street in the city sold opium. After the victory, despite strict anti-drug orders, the Korean still lives there and continues to operate, using ignorant food stores and street vendors to sell on his behalf. The flow of "three-rivers-rice" (slang for opium) never stops, and people come and go to buy it without restraint. The above three evils are open secrets currently disrupting Shanghai and poisoning the people. Please urge the police authorities to pay attention, eradicate evil thoroughly, and bring happiness to society! (Reader: Tian Min)</p>
