<h3>國大開幕僅餘一日　大局發展今可分曉</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕國大開幕僅餘一日，政府尙無再行延期象徵，大局發展，今日即可分曉。共產黨雖己一再表示決不提名單，但其他黨派可能即將提出。青年黨人士十三日晚曾集會硏討代表名單，李璜十四日可自滬來京，即作最後決定。張君觔亦己準備提出，唯聞民盟仍擬施以壓力，故目前最困難者厥惟民盟，結果如何，現尙難定。又據聞國大召開期間，軍事政治談判，將不致中斷，即各方仍將一面開會一而商談也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕某權威人士稱，共產黨認爲國大如召開，將造成全面破裂，吾人實不悉其用意何在，因國大召開，本係遵守政協決議，在政府已具有澴政於民決心，故一再要求各黨派提出名單，不意共產黨竟堅持不提，倘永遠不提，即意在使國大或不能開成，不知是何居心。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕共產黨辦事處十四日將舉行記者招待會，說明對時局態度。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕國大代表十三日報到者共十三人，社會賢達代表錢新之亦於下午辦理手續。餘爲黃季陸，端木愷，麻傾翁等，未報到者僅〇六人，其中沿有若干名在京未及前往者，其餘則尙滯留各省市，國大決於十五日揭幕，日來各機關爲表示歡迎，特分別舉行茶會招待，首都黨政團機關，十三日舉行聯合茶會，招待全體代表，勵志社自十三日至十五日每晚招待國大代表五百人前往觀「孟美女」歌劇。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕司使十三日上午曾接見國府參軍皮宗敢，四時司使與馬特使晤見。翁文灝於六時訪馬特使，談一小時。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕蔣主席於十三日中午召宴吳鐵城，張厲生，洪蘭友諸人。</p>
<p>張君勵今日晉京　携有提名單原則</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會民主黨領袖張君勱，由京來滬後，即召集該黨在滬人士商討國大問題及對整個決策交換意見。十三日上下午又繼續會議，茲據該黨發言人孫寳毅語記者稱：二日來會談結果，社會民主黨決　盡嚴後之努力，提交國大名單，並無不可能，日仍須有相當條件，最主要者乃要求政府：（一）依　政治協商會議進行：（二）澈底改組政府，尤須改組行政府，張氏已準備將此決非議携京，向政府當局提出如獲同意，即可立即提交名單。該黨人士並一致希望，國在能延期至十二月一日行，在此期前能照政協決議辦事，同時蔣主席能與毛澤東晤面，解決事政治問題，　張氏此次返滬，對大局發展認各方面均有讓步表現，前途可　樂觀，記者詢以民社黨國大代表名單是否將與民盟其他各黨派同時提出。渠稱：本黨國大代表名額，現已由民盟一百二十名總額內分配四十名，希望與民盟同時提出，但在某在種情形下，亦可單獨提出。又據記者探悉，該黨國大名單，現尚未決定，前曾擬有名單，此次若決定提交，恐將重行推定，按前擬名單略加更動。又張氏原定昨晚乘晚車晋京，現改定十四日搭飛機起程，蔣勻田氏則已於昨晚晋京。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕靑年黨領袖李璜，十二日晨由京返滬，據該黨總部消息：李氏返滬，純係料理私事，關於靑年黨對時局態度，均須在京決定，外傳李氏返滬係召開本黨重要會議，商討提具國大代表名單一節，完全不確。又李氏在滬稍作勾留即晋京。</p>
<h3>進攻延安說完全不確　國大決非不再延期　彭部長於記者會上談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕中宣部十三日下午三半假國大會堂代表休息室，茶會招待出席大會全體巾外記者百餘人，由彭部長致詞，歡迎各地來于京記者，表示期望採訪工作成功，並答記者詢問，</p>
<p>問：各黨派是否已提出代表名單？如未提，何方面可望提出？</p>

<p>問：國大是否有再度延期可能</p>
<p>答：「吾」。</p>
<p>問：如共產黨及其他黨派不提名單，拒絕參加，政府是否仍將召集原有代表開會，通過憲法？</p>
<p>答：就前一問題之答覆言，此問題係多餘者，但政府仍希望各黨派均能派代表出席國大。至此次國大是否通過憲法，則係國大本身之權限。</p>
<p>問：停戰令下達後，軍事情况如何？</p>
<p>答：過去共產黨曾要求無條件全面停戰，今政府已下停戰令，共產黨則尙未有同樣行動，且謂政府此舉係「僞善的」，惟各地國軍接得命令後，均已切實遵行停戰，乃係事實‘</p>
<p>問：國大開幕時，是否將邀請各國使節團參加？</p>
<p>答：「是」</p>
<p>問：截至目前止，代表報到者已有若干人？</p>
<p>答：約一千三百人。</p>
<p>問：共軍猛烈圍攻台兒莊之消息是否確實？詳情如何？</p>
<p>答：官方已得同樣報吿，但詳情未悉，希望無此不平常事件。一</p>
<p>問：政府方面對社會民主黨宣傳部長徐傅霖之談話反應如何？</p>
<p>答：徐氏談話已在報端閱悉，不擬於此際有所表示，唯政府實盼各黨派能參加國大，共爲實施憲政努力，希各位密切注意近數日事實之演進。</p>
<p>問：久傳聞共產黨代表團即將撤返延安，確否？</p>
<p>答：對此事尙無所聞。</p>
<p>問：聞靑年黨已決定提出國大代表名單，確吾？</p>
<p>答：此事應詢諸靑年黨。</p>
<p>問：中共稱國軍擬攻延安外圍，確吾？</p>

<p>答：此似應詢諸第三方面。</p>
<p>問：政府是否已獲得青年黨及民盟關於提出國大代表名單之保證？</p>
<p>答：靑年黨及民盟人士已赴滬商量提名單事宜，當彼等未返京前，政府不便就此有所表示。</p>
<p>問：國府委會及行政院是否將於國大開會前改組？</p>
<p>答：國府委會可隨時改組，至政院乃執行機關不可一日停頓，大會前無改組可能。</p>
<p>問：是否已談妥先決定行政院改組之名單，而於國大開會後即進行改組？</p>
<p>答：於此無所悉。</p>
<p>問：政協決議尙未　實施即召開國大，政府是否已顧及此點？</p>
<p>答：政協決議識未盡實施，但該決議包括太廣，且如整軍等問題非政府一方面所能爲力，即再拖兩月，亦難求其全部實施。最後彭氏復請各記者於會後閱讀停戰令下達時及元月間軍事形勢地圖，並稱：「我們十五日再見」，至四時三刻會。</p>
<p>立法院憲草審議會：（上）五讀五五憲草修正案。（下）審議會情形。（本報攝）</p>
<h3>中共在京人員　部份撤返延安</h3>
<p>周恩來亦有離京說</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕共產黨代表團十二日晨曾自京撤退卅一人，乘美軍專機返延安，現尙留六十餘人，聞局恩來已決短期內離京返延。</p>
<h3>整理憲草修正案　五寵惠說明經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕王寵惠十三日晨列席立法院五委會聯席會議，說明整理「五五憲草修正案草案」整理經過，略謂：本人爲參加憲草審議會委員之一，該會根據協商原則，經七次會議曾作三項修正，此次訂正稿，係以五五憲草爲藍木，並就各方對憲草意見與憲草審議會擬議而未完成之草案擬成者，其由最後兩章未經憲草審議會決議，其餘亦有經硏究或保留者。此次從事整理工作，時間匆追，難免不有遺漏，惟修改時曾定下原則，即更改愈少愈好。同時，總裁亦曾提出若干指示，五五憲草先後會經各方研究，殊多精闢，現爲應各方要求，乃以總理遺敎，容納協商原則從事修訂，修訂可分成兩大部分，其一爲原則上與　草不同</p>
<h3>綜合會談仍無結果　昨仍以憲草爲討論中心</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕非正式粽合會談十三日下午三時在孫科寓舉行，到孫科，邵力子，雷震，莫德惠，繆嘉銘，陳啓天，曾琦，黃炎培，羅隆基，章伯鈞，共產黨代表周恩來未出席，董必武單獨前往，據聞十三日仍以憲草爲討論中心，至下午六時散後，邵力子，雷震即往晋謁主席報吿，十時始返。雷不肯作任何表示。據民盟人士稱，今日會談甚簡單，毫無結果，十四日是否舉行會談尙未悉，唯民盟。靑年黨。社會賢達十四日上午仍在交行開會，並攝影留念。者，另一部爲因原則變更隨之更動者，就後者而言，更動之處並不甚多。繼就訂正本逐　予以說明，第二章人民之權利與義務，修正之處，並不甚多，訂正本與原草案目的相同，僅出發點相異，此章修正係根據政協憲草決議第九條之原則，即關於人民自由如有法津規定，須出之於保障自由之精神非以限制爲月的，因之，原憲草中所有「非依法律不得限制之」等字樣，皆予删除。易言之，即以保障爲出發點，而不重限制，同時第二十四條」關於以上所列舉之自由權利除爲限止妨碍他人自由等外，不得以法律限制之」，因之，將來立法院擬法時，多少亦受限制，對人民權利，不能隨便擬法。關於國民大會，政協亦有決定，根據五五憲草，國大每三年開一次，集二千餘人於一堂，其餘時間應作何事，實成問題，例如國大有罷免總統之權，創議憲法之權，然不能天天罷免總統，創制憲法，二中全會乃將其修改，對集會期及召開臨時會議有詳細規定，國大之組織與職權，亦與五五憲草不同，根據憲草審議會各地所選之立法委員與監察委員皆爲國大代表，如是可使立法，監察兩院與國大發生聯繫，故於廿六條中加一二兩款，職權方面亦有不同，國大除選舉及罷免總統，副總統外，其職權爲憲法修改之經辦與複決。立法院所提憲法之修正案，二千餘人羣聚一堂，不易擬議法律，不若擬議原則，此點與外國之創議制相同，國大擬定原則後，再交立法機關完成之，惟仍有梭決權，對立法院所提憲草修正案，可予複決。第四章「總統」係根據政協憲草決議第七條所改正者，訂正案第四十四條最爲重要，此條係規定總統如何發布緊急命令者，訂正案規定總統於立法院休會期間，得經行政會一議之決議，依緊急命令法發布緊念侖令，此點爲五五憲草所無者，換言之，即若在立法院開會册間，總統即不得發布緊急命令。同時，總統須依緊急命令，始得發布，如是責任分明，提交立法院追認之時期，亦由三個月縮爲一個月，較合標準，且可避免無謂爭議。（下文轉入第二版）</p>
<h3>張群今可抵滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕月前赴美養疴之四川省主席張群氏，自奉當局電召後，即離美轉東京返國，今晨當司飛抵滬，張氏在滬將稍作勾留，與各方領袖非正式交換意見，然後晋京，向主席請示，並出席國大。社會民主黨領袖張君勱氏，原定昨晚晋京，臨時決定延期，俾於張氏抵滬後有所洽談。</p>
<h3>立法院開聯席會　憲草因程序問題審查　孫科請吳鼎昌補辦手續</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕立法院審査憲草會議十三日上午舉行，到委員柳克述，陳訓悆，陳長蘅，司徒德，簡貫三等六十餘人，由法制委員會委員長林彬主席，國防最高委員會秘書長王寵惠與駐敎廷公使吳經熊均列席，王氏說叫訂正稿修正經過，並就增訂之條文加以闡釋，歷八十分　，吳氏繼作補充說明，兩氏旋即退席。五五憲草修正案草案訂正稿，係依據政協　草審議委員會未完成稿，山王寵惠，吳經熊，雷震諸氏整理而成，最近政協憲草審議將再予審査，俾益臻究善。本日會議中，因該案係主席直接交議，而依法交議之案，須由中常會或國防會提出，茲因發生立法程序間題，多數委員僉認不應提付討論，當經決定脅時停會，並報吿孫院長處理此事，十一時廿五分散會。</p>
<p>〔本報南就十三日電〕立院聯席審查會十三日晨會後，主席林彬即趨訪孫科，報吿審查會情形，孫氏對完成程序一節，當即電請國府吳文長補辦手續，但對於修正案應否予以審議一節，則以爲立院係對中央負責，不能堅持異議，擬分別如見各委員，予以勸吿，關聯席會議可能於十六日重開，以使用時將該案審議完竣，提出國大討論。</p>
<h3>立法院五委員會聯席審查會上</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　寗遠</p>
<p>國大開幕展期宣布了之後，各黨派及社會賢達正在考慮應否提出名單，參加會議的時候，這行將提交大會討論的憲草，又在立法院擱淺了。時局的多難，這時候已達到了最高潮。</p>
<p>立法院於本月十一日根據蔣主席戍佳（十一月九日）府交京第七九八〇統代電，召集臨時會議，討論憲草審議委員會政府委員孫科等五人所擬訂的五五憲草修正案，當天就有委員劉　訓首先提出異議，終以主席孫院長因彼時正在討論程序問題，停止其發言，白髮老委員劉氏就聲明退席，當時的會塲空氣，十分緊張，多沙人都寄予無言的同情。終於在十三日五委員會聯席審査會上爆發了與劉氏共鳴的炸彈。</p>
<p>在王亮疇，吳經熊兩氏說明了修改經過之後，首先發難者是狄君武委員，狄委員，先就立法程序上說話，認爲立法院祇能討論三種方式所產生出來的提案：第一是中央常會的決議；第二是中央政治會議，即現在代爲行使職權的國防最高委員會的決議；第三是立法委員本身的建議案，現在這國府代電交下來的憲草修正案，都不屬於前三者所產生出來的，狄委員認爲這是開立法院從來未有的創例，要是所討論的問題不關重要，那也罷了，現在所要討論的是國家百年大法，我們木身若是貿然接受討論，我們都要受千秋萬世的人們的責備的。其次對於內容問題所有訂正案的修正原則，是根據政治協商會議的決議，但是與二中全市所決議的，顯然大有衝突，現在政府還是屬於國民黨指揮黨督的，我們祗能接受國民黨中央執行員會的指示，不能受於法無據的政協的拘束，若是我們不接受二中全會的決議，我們是違背自己的職責。他的結論認爲根據這兩點的前提，我們是否可以接受該訂正案而加以審議，是値得考慮本報記者的一會事。</p>
<p>狄委員慷慨陳詞以後，陳海澄委員亦提出類似的責難，陳委員指出三點：第一，政協和綜合小組的意見，是否應該接受？第二點，二中全會的決議，本院是否應受拘束？第三點，訂正案有違背國父遺敎之處，本院是否應予糾正？</p>
<p>這時主席林彬一再發言，請大家先就有疑問之處先提出，請列席的王亮疇，吳經熊兩先生答復，且慢討論內容和原則的問題。這時蒙古委員祁志厚又站起來，認爲現在應先決定這草案是否應予接受討論，如果不討論，不必再提疑問。陳長薪委員對原則問題剛說了兩句話，被座後的　聲打下去。王亮　和吳經熊兩先生，在這形勢之下，也只好先行退席了。</p>
<p>這時又來了一個插曲，綏遠委員吳雲鵬氏起立謂，此刻有蒙古代表數人來院訪問，對於憲草有意見提出，希望能給予發言的機會，接着有人打斷了他的話，謂我們今天旣是討論憲草，不必請他們在此發言，吳雲鵬認爲他們遠道來此，本院至少應派人和他們談談，在匆忙中，主席就指定了狄　和張鳳九兩委員去見他們。</p>
<p>問題又問到憲草，大家七嘴八舌吵子一會，有幾個人嚷着散會，而且站起來要走的樣子，秩序非常混亂。這時李慶塵委員說話了，他說無論討論不討論，會場秩序終要維持的，要不然這幾乎是戲塲了。</p>
<p>大家鎭靜下來了。</p>
<p>林彬委員長立起報吿，據他說：孫院長昨日（十二日）下午曾的幾位立法委員談話，報吿憲草修正的經過，並且說明這幾天各方接洽的情形。院長的看法，除中共迄未表示可以參加的意見外，其他的黨派似乎都在準備出席，所以綜合小組現在正在討論未完成的憲草修正案，也許最近幾天內，會提出整個的修正案，我們此時若先討論這未完成的修正案，到那時也許又要重新整理過。所以林氏主張審査會暫時延期，等到十五日國大開幕後，再加以硏究。</p>
<p>何遂委員補充主席的意見，蔣主席代電送來的憲草修正案，旣未符合法定程序，正可在我們等的時候完成這個程序。</p>
<p>最後，主席宣佈散會，並聲明今天討論的情形即將向孫院長報吿。</p>
<p>會後孫院長常然首先得到了消息，之後吳鼎昌文官長也得到了消息，中央黨部吳秘書長最後也得到消息，大家都在分頭商討如何完成合法的程序的問題。文官處可能將此案移送中央秘書處，而中央秘書處當然應立即召開中常會，但是巾常會所遇到的困難問題，又是它是否可以變更二中全會的決議，若是要完全合法，非召集二中全會不可，但是後天就是國大開幕的日子，那裏有時間再開全會，問題的最後解決，看情形非假手總裁的裁定權不可，於是這任勞任怨的國民黨領袖，又得親自負担這付重大的責任了。</p>
<p>所謂程序的問題，雖似困難終易解決，至於內容問題實在是根本的問題，無疑的這修正案是與中山先生的遺造是大有出入的，若是國家從此能達長治久安的目的，則中山先生的信徒也只有毅然接受下來，問題是縱使接受了這不願接受的修正案，共產黨和各黨派的人士，還不一定會全數參加國大，於是有人認爲旣然如此，國民黨何必老老實實先接受這個修正案，不如先等一會，算到各黨派有誠意參加國大時，再考慮其修正案尙未爲晚。林彬所以要等國大開會日再提出討論，實際上就是爲了這個原因。</p>

<h3>顧維鈞氏發表演說　中美貿易前途光明　籲請美工商界毋須躁急</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十二日合衆電〕中國駐美大使顧維鈞，頃於美全國對外貿易會議席上，籲　美國工商界，勿爲中美貿易一時未能全部恢復而感沮喪，亦毋須躁急。顧氏稱：中國不安定之情形，僅係全國統一過程中不可避免之階段，此種統一，爲發展覽易及其他建設性努力之必需條件，蓋國家獲得統一後，穩定之情形，將與之俱來，而政治；經濟·社會之改進與建設，亦得着于進行，且能向成功之道推進。中國政府現正努力改善進口與內地之交通運輸後，且正在推進土地改革，中國之經濟現狀，與美國南北戰爭後，粗可比擬。由美貿易之潛在可能性，實未可限量，長期之展望，亦甚遼闊，中國工業化計劇之目的，第一步在提高生活水準，第二步在增加購買力，而此終必大量增加中國對美國生產品之需求，諸如電話，收音機·冰箱·眞空消除器等，中美兩國貿易上之支付平衡，以中國向爲入超之國家，故吾人須使本國工業化，增加生產，增加出口，然後支付進口價款時，可較爲輕易。顧氏繼稱：由美商約中的包蘊之政策，至爲開朗自由，故吾人可以正當之推測與信心，預卜兩國貿易關係之前途，新條約中具有美國發展在華貿易之重要因素，即全中國領土均向美國商人開放是也。商約之基本原則，爲平等與互惠，美國人民可永久信賴中國人民之善意，兩國人民間，實經常存有友誼上之門戶開放，中美貿易在輔助彼此之需要，美國商人有未能與中國出口商競爭者，如猪鬃·　礦·　礦·蠶絲及茶葉，即非美國之生產品，中國之刺繡，花邊及麻織物製造時，須高度技巧，且　時甚久，以美國勞工成本之昂貴，故亦無法出品，然在另一方面，美國之鋼·鐵·木材·小麥·麵粉·棉織品等，即非中國生產所能頡頑。顧氏並表示，汽車·鐵道與船隻，在中國僅能獲得有限之市塲。</p>
<h3>范宣德發表演說　論「不投資政策」</h3>
<p>希望我國民大會能有賢明協議</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十二日電〕國務院遠東司長范宣德今日在國外貿易恊會演說，謂中國外匯及國外貿易管理法規，僅係一稱暫時鎭靜劑。美國政府與私人方面，對於官僚普遍貪汚，商人相率欺詐，及政府浪費資財於過分的軍備之國，不宜向之投資。范宣德並臚舉此種「不投資政策」所涉及之國，如業已發生內戰或將發生內戰者，政府專營事業排斥美國商業者及反民主份子控制政權者均屬之。渠對於此等國名則竭力避免指出。先是，范宣德演說曾稱：國務院希望中國能逃避繼續內爭之禍患，並望未來國民大會能有賢明之恊議。中國經濟之穩定與復興正爲其不幸的政治軍事局勢所阻滯，現行外匯及國外貿易管理條規僅足以救一時之急。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕聯總遠東區域委員會昨日上午九時半起，在中國銀行大樓舉行會議，出席者計有中·英·美·蘇·法·澳·印·荷等八國代表，該會首先舉行非正式會議，討論該會主席蔣延　辭職後之繼任人選問題，經一致推選顏惠慶博士繼任，並推行總副署長李卓敏博士及荷蘭代表史塔克爲副主席。出席各代表名單爲中國顏惠慶·李卓敏·美國蓋柏屈立克·澳洲及新西蘭霍爾·英國史旦特及享達女士，法國勃勒地安·荷蘭史塔克·蘇聯西半那斯·印度海遜·及聯總駐華代表艾格頓將軍。</p>
<p>霍寶樹氏致詞</p>
<p>席間，顏惠慶博士特向衆介紹行總署長霍向衆介紹行總署長霍實樹以示歡迎。當由霍署長起立致謝，並稱：「各位代表過去竭盡才智，貢獻於遠東之善後救濟工作，深用欽佩，今願向諸君保證，本人在職務範圍內，盡力協助聯總大會賦予諸位之使命。惟余深信本會決無人希望遠東區域會發展爲裁判性質，進而預聞聯總在遠東之行政工作或干預被救濟國之純粹行政問題者。最近行總努力出淸上海港口物資之成績，已促成聯總恢復對華運輸。賴伽第亞署長曾宣佈全部恢復對華之運輸，僅待美國海員罷工工潮解決，物資即可啓運。惟另一方面，聯總供應計劃之範圍未確定，船運之確實日期及內容未確定，聯總技術專家在華之工作期限未確定，在在影響本署之工作，希望本會切實討論，予以確定之解決。聯總預定供給中國之物資總量尙有一半以上待運來華，余深信下屆聯總大會必能予吾人以保證，在聯總未完成其工作前不致結束，蓋無此保證，則工作不能順利推進也。因此深盼本會一致向下屆聯總大會作明確堅決之建議。」</p>
<p>霍署長詞畢，各國代表即開始討論各項議題。顏博士並宣讀大會決議案，對蔣廷　氏一致表示崇敬，並對其過去半年來在行總之貢獻，致其敬佩熱忱。</p>
<p>遣送難民槪况</p>
<p>大會討論遣送難民問題，由沙伯博士報告工作情形。該委員會迄今爲止，遣送華僑返緬甸者達一千九百人，返新加坡者九百十八人，以後如得緬甸政府許可，尙將有一萬二千華僑遣往，至明年六月底前，將有三萬三千華僑遣送至各地，遣送各國難民經費，除已獲聯總允發美金三十萬元外，又請求撥給美金一百九十萬元。奧國難民經當局批准，將由華遣送二千名返國。惟德國僑民則因該國經濟狀况困難，一時尙不易遣運。捷克及南斯拉夫僑民現每月有若干被遣送返國，至義大利僑民，則已接獲該國報告，派船來華接運。在十二月底前可全部運畢。</p>
<p>其他各問題，如聯總救濟中國醫藥物資，中國棉紡，工業以及其他救濟物資等問題，將保留至各小組或今日會議討論。</p>
<p>該委會昨日下午舉行小組會議，今日上午九時半繼續舉行大會</p>

<h3>國軍遵守停戰令聲中　延安召開動員會　東北山東共軍繼續進攻</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕政府爲求和平統一，曾自動頒布停戰令，十一日正午起業已生效，但共產黨方面迄無停業表示，且劍拔弩張，有積極發動大戰之準備。據十二日延安廣播，共產黨中央曾召集所謂保衛陜甘寗邊區與延安幹部的動員會，到各方幹部千餘人，由朱德，彭德懷，劉少奇先後講話，異口同聲，要求大家學習戰鬥技術，如埋地雷，打手溜彈，準備撕殺。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕軍調部政府委員鄭介民，十三日尙未接到共產黨方面對於停戰備忘錄之答覆。政府參謀長蔡文治，十三日對記者稱：執行部監督停戰事，因共黨未採取合作態度，故尙不能有所作爲，一般判斷，在南京軍事三人小組對停戰具體辦法未獲恊議前，執行部之凍結狀態無法改變。記者問，十一月十一日正午後，共軍有無軍事行動，蔡答：在東北農安西北以及山東安邱，臨淄，陜西榆林一帶，共軍繼續採取攻勢。</p>
<h3>共軍攻懷德　馮營長陣亡</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十三日電〕十一日午後三時，共軍約二千餘，突將長春南懷德包圍，該城守軍營長馮永昌率部三百人抵抗，激戰二小時，以衆寡懸殊，官兵死傷十分之七八，馮營長陣亡，薄暮該城情况不明，電隊將消息傳抵此間，此爲停戰令頒發後第一次之不幸事件。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州十三日電〕蘇北二淮，魯南，魯西前綫國軍，至十一日午均遵令停止前進，而魯南共軍十一日晚又向我台棗支綫與臨棗支綫之郭村，東西鄒塢等地同時大舉進犯，山家林大橋被炸毀，激戰至十二晨，共軍始被擊退，但國軍絕未追擊，惟將政府停戰命令送達共方，促其注意責任。</p>
<h3>整理憲草修正案　王寵惠說明經過</h3>
<p>上文接第一版</p>
<p>規定行政之第五章，各方最爲注意，此軍係根據政協第六條所擬訂，惟該條第二款如立法院對行政院全體不信任時，政院或辭職，或提請總統解散立法院，此點二中全全曾發生大疑問，蓋與遺敎相遠，綜合小組將此款刪去，此條所引起爭議最多。同時，外間對五十六條行政院對立法院負責之規定，議論亦多，其實此一規定，不必皆統稱之爲總統制，或內閣制，蓋其並無不信任權，行政院對立法院亦無解散權，故與英法兩國內閣制相異。同時，又有「立法院覆議維持原決議時，該決議行政院長應予接受或辭職。」之規定，此爲採總統制之美國所無者，亦爲較總統制爲優之處。又總統「辭職」後，總統可選一新行政院長以與立法院磋商，如是多留一轉　餘地，總統亦可不直接與立法院衝突。美國往往因總統與國會衝突，政務因之延擱，而訂正案有「立法委員三分之二維持原決議」一項規定，彼此有磋商餘地，盼各方能平心加以討論，並與外國總統內閣制予以比較。</p>
<p>第六章立法，係根據政府恊第二條改訂者，張君　對第三條「立法院對於行政院所提預算案，不得爲增加支出之提議。」爭執頗烈，其所以如此規定者，蓋立法院若可提議增加預算，則由各省市所選出之立法委員，皆可建議增加，互相交換表決權，使行政院爲難，故規定支出不能增加。司法與考試兩軍中八十三條，規定法官須超出黨派以外，依據法律，獨立審判：惟第九十二條，規定考試委員須超出於黨派以外，此係遺漏之處；監察機關職權中多一「同意」權。第九十五九十六兩條，亦與原憲草不同。</p>
<p>關於中央與地方之權限一章，係根據政恊第八條第二款所擬訂者，對二者問權限之細分，依均權主義，予以規定且有伸縮餘地。關於司法，財政，經濟事項，原屬地方，後由最高當局改屬中央，中央與地方權限若有爭論時，根據一百十條之規定，由立法院解決之，此亦爲一種新辦法。關於省憲問題，政恊規定爲「省得制定省憲」。其後經憲草審議會之修正，改爲「省得制定自治法」。關於省自治法，應否經中央核准問題，爭論頗烈，進第一百十三條之規定，「如司法院認爲有違憲之處，應將遵憲條文宣布無效」，並須於制定後一個月內送司法院，因之可任其實行，此爲折衷辦法。</p>
<p>吳經熊之說明</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕吳經熊氏十三日於立法院五委會聯席會議審議「五五憲草修正案草案訂正稿」時，說明該稿整理經過稱，外傳改變政協憲草原則，係二中全會所發動，此點與事實顯不符合，蓋憲草審議會開會於前，而後二中全會如召開。憲草審議會開會時，我人即曾提出，對若干決議應加修改，當時並曾發生爭執。例如第一點，根據政恊決議，國大爲無形之國大，政府代表即就學理與邏輯力爭，當不能因此而認我方不守信義，且政恊會當時即決議組織一憲草審議會，此即就憲草問題之研討留有一餘地，各方對憲草若有良好建議自可提出，我人即根據此種精神於憲草審議會提供意見，盼能修正。第二點，根據政恊第五項決議案，第六條第二款之規定「如立法院對行政院全體不信任時，行政院或辭職或提請總統解散立法院，但同一行政院長不得再提請解散立法院，此條無異成立一完全內閣制，實與總理遺敎相背，我方代表參加憲草審議會時，即就此點認爲應予修正。最後，關於省憲問題，我人在憲草審議會中亦曾力爭，決議改爲省自治法，上述種種皆足證明我人於二中全會開會前即曾力爭，而非二中全會後始正式提出，此點應予聲明，以上三點，憲草審議會中，皆已獲得恊議，此次整理，一部份即係根據上述三原則予以修正。</p>
<h3>社論　今天是最後一天了！</h3>
<p>國民大會延期三天，兩大已經過去了，只剩下了今天最後一天了。時局發展到今天，可謂已到了最高峯；時機的迫切，有如千鈞一髮。全國的老百姓，翹首南京，時時刻刻，期特着好消息傳來。但是我們在報上所看到的；不是中共代表團一部份人員，已乘坐美機飛返延安，就是延安頒發總動員令，準備在各綫反攻，和我們老百姓所期望的根本相反，中共所爲實在太令人失望了。</p>
<p>回想起去年敵寇屈膝投降之後，毛澤東先生曾應蔣主席之召，赴渝會談，中共代表即高唱和平民主的口號，當時在我們頭腦單純的老百姓聽來，似乎娓娓動聽。因爲在抗戰勝利之後，我們老百妙所日夜渴望的，就是和平民主。其後和談，波瀾迭起，一直到最近，對於中共的態度，雖覺不可理喻，但仍不表示絕望，終認爲中共必有幡然覺悟的一天。就是本報站在人民的立塲，也一再撰文，勸告中共應以國家爲重，放下屠刀，立地成佛。此時大澈大悟，尙爲未晚；但是我們苦口婆心，千言萬語，早已說完了。到了最近，幾乎也無話可說。只覺得中共的態度，實在不可理解。</p>
<p>中共旣渴望和平，且曾要求政府立即停戰；但至政府頒佈停戰令時，中共不但自己不下令停戰，反而說什麼片面決定，就表示不能同意了。這種强詞奪理的說法，怎能令人信服！又中共口口聲聲，要求民主，但至政府決定召開國民大會，還政於民，實行憲政時，中共匪特不表示歡迎，反而千方百計，橫加阻撓，使更番延期的國民大會，至開幕的前夕，又決定延期三天論理中共也應該參加了，但是中共心猶未足，非使國民大會開不成不可，時乎時乎？轉瞬之間，二天又過去了，而且是錯過了，只剩下了今天最後一天，但中共的態度，不但沒有幡然覺悟的跡像，而且變本加厲，更加倔强了。周恩來不但以「和談決裂，應由政府負其貴任。」來威脅政府，而且中共代表團以準備返延安來威脅我們老百姓。中共旣然要民主，有什麼理由可以反對國民黨還政與民呢？實在使我們大惑不解！至以周恩來所提出中共參加國民大會的三項條件而論，也實在沒有理由可言。不值得一辯。據報載稱，這三項條件是：（一）政府必先行改組；（二）由政協綜合小組舉行非正式會談所決定之憲草，必須保證國民大會必能予以通過；（三）中共參加國民大會代表名單，必須向改組後之政府提出。</p>
<p>和談的經過，在我們老百姓看來，好比歷歷在目，毋庸複按，政府改組的　延，也是受了中共的阻撓所致；自不待言，至於憲法草案，三民主義旣爲全國人民一致所信奉的主義，中共也承認三民主義爲建國的最高原則，如果依照三民主義而起草的憲法，必能獲得國民大會的通過，絕無疑義實無保證的必要。</p>
<p>要而言之，我們始終尊重中共在國內政治上的地位，至今猶希望中共能爲自己的前途打算，勿自暴自棄；最近幾天來中共所表示的，實無異於自棄於國人，我們眞替中共可惜。今天是最後一天了，我們還在這裏希望中共的幡然覺悟！</p>
<h3>託管制度的檢討</h3>
<p>聯合國大會自本月四日起，即開始討論殖民地的託管問題；因爲聯合會國憲章對於託管制度，並未加以明確切實的規定，第一屆聯合國大會在倫敦開會的時候，對於這個棘手的問題，也沒有商得任何協議，於是各國的代表，尤其是蘇聯與英美兩國的代表，對於所謂「直接關係國家」，究作何解釋？仍沒有獲得任何進展。但是殖民地的託管問題，不僅有關數千萬人民未來的命運，而且對於世界和平也有密切關係，所以聯合國大會在這幾天內，仍要繼續討論這個問題，務使聯合國機構能在第二屆大會期間，正式設立託管理事會。英美對於這個問題，業已提出一項建議，蘇聯雖已表示異議，但據英美兩國代表與其他各國代表接洽的結果，可望獲得聯合國大會的通過，因此託管理事會不久也就可以正式成立了。</p>
<p>在資本帝國主義的時代，殖民地向爲各國所爭取的對象，甚至爲了爭取殖民地，不惜以兵戎相見，以致引起滔天的戰禍，第一次世界大戰，固然可視爲各資本帝國主義爭取殖民地的戰爭，就是第二次世界大戰也是同樣性質的戰爭。所以一般有遠見的政治外交家，在一九一九年巴黎和會時，苦心孤詣，欲爲殖民地問題覓獲一個合理解決的辦法，國聯代管制，也就應運而在。代管制的本身。在理論固然也是一稱合乎理想的制度，但在實際上，不僅未能實現代管制的理想，而且代管地就是變相的殖民地。反而使殖民地問題更加複雜了。經過第二次大戰之從，各國政治外交家都覺得代管制實有廢棄的必要；而創設另一種新頴的制度，取其地位而代之。在舊金山會議時，就有託管制的提出。當時因爲時間的匆促，未能從長討論，僅僅規定了幾項原則，對於所謂「直接關係國家」，並未能加以確切的規定。到了今年一月，聯合國大會在倫敦舉行第一屆會議時，又因各國意見紛歧，未能商有成議，於是這個託管問題，也就成了目前國際上懸案。</p>
<p>這次聯合國大會在紐約開幕後，各國代表紛紛要求討論託管問題，自本月四日起，即開始討論，首由各國代表相繼發表演說，在各人的演詞裏發現各國對於所謂「直接關係國家」的解釋，各不相同。如此討論了一星期，沒有獲得一個頭緒。其中關鍵，還是在蘇聯與英美兩國的見解不啻南轅北轍。緣美國對於太平洋以前由日本代替的島嶼，又向託管委員會，提出一個託管協定的草案，在原則上雖然也主張將太平洋以前由日本代管的島嶼，完全移交聯合國託管；但是美國仍要求保留其管理權，這無異美國要求單獨託管，同時美國又正要在這些島嶼上，設立軍事基地，當然要引起蘇聯的疑懼，所以蘇聯出席聯合國大會代表諾維柯夫，首先表示異議，斯拉夫集團各國，唯蘇聯馬首是瞻者，也同聲附和。據云蘇聯對於「直接關係國家」別有一種解釋。所以蘇聯代表提議：「在託管理事會成立之後，討論任何一國所提出之託管恊定　案時，中·英·美·法·蘇五國，即自動的發生「直接關係」，對於協定草案均得行使否決權。英美對於蘇聯抱着這種見解，當然萬難贊同，如果依照蘇聯的建議行事，美國所提出的託管協定草案，絕無獲得託管理事會通過的可能。所以美國又於十一日照會託管委員會所有各會負國，正式表示：託管委員會如不能贊同美國所提出之建議，則美國將保留旣成事賓，即永久控制太平洋以前由日本代管的島嶼，例如馬紹爾羣島，加羅林羣島，曁馬利亞納羣島是。　　託管委員會於十一日開會時，蘇聯代表諾維柯夫，又發表了一長篇大議論，對於英·美·法·澳洲·比利時曁南菲聯邦等國所提出的託管協定草案，一一加以非議，並斥爲與聯合國憲章所揭　的原則，根本相反。這樣，在聯合國大會中，蘇聯與英美兩方面，因對於託管問題的見解不同而引起的裂痕，也就更加露骨了。蘇聯代表雖然也表示，願望託管理事會能早日成立，但其所爲，不啻阻撓託管理事會的成立，誠如美國代表杜勒斯所稱：「蘇聯雖時時抱怨託管理本會尙未成立，但其行爲無往而不妨礙託管理事會的成立」。</p>
<p>至於我國對於託管問題的態度，我國代表劉　也曾在聯合國大會發表演說主張託管理事會早日成立，並謂：「吾人切勿使託管制成爲分　制，更不可令其成爲紙上具文；而吾人應使現在數千萬人民，獲得安慰，知聯合國機構即將採取步驟，以保障其未來的進步及自由」。記得本年一月間，聯合國大會在倫敦開會，討論託管問題時，我國代表顧維鈞博士，曾明白表示我國對於此一問題的　本立塲。其言曰：「託管制是代管制的一大進步，數千萬人民均將受其利益，託管制可能加速代管地人民在政治上經濟上社會上及敎育上的發展，使其建立自治政府完成其獨立自主的志願，得以早日實現」。所以我們深望託管理事會能早日成立，並盼望各國的政治外交家，均能高瞻遠囑，擬聞自私自利的觀念，一方面不要利用託管制，以遂一國之私；另一方面也不要橫加阻撓，使託管理事會無法成立，徒求一時的痛快，而應該替數千萬的人民多想想，使他們早日達到自主獨立的最後目標；同時並使殖民地問題不復爲引起戰禍的根源。</p>

<h3>新聞電項目</h3>
<p>杭記者通電請减低</p>
<p>〔本報杭州訊〕浙江省會外勤記者協會同仁，以此次電價調整，新聞電亦險之一漲十倍，咸以爲對新聞報導頗受影響，經一致滅決，通電全國新聞同業，響應要求交通部，對新聞電價目重予調整，以維新聞事業之發展。稅外，已增加田賦之百分之五十一，公糧之百分之十五，且另有契稅之全部，營業稅之百分之五十，實已充分寬裕，故各縣市主管應視地方需要之緩急，努力先後舉辦建設事業。九時許開始各縣財政稅務及公庫狀况之報吿，迄十二時休息，下午二時繼續報吿，至四時許始畢，大會宣告休息一刻鐘。本報記者綜合八縣報吿詞內容，大多陳述預算收支不能平衡，致因地制宜特稅尙有不能停徵者，譬如吳江縣即類此，曾以此問題詢諸財廳科長顧俊南，據吿此類情形財廳決嚴予制止。四時三十分繼續開會，董廳長特就各縣所提出之各項困難問題，發表一般性解釋，茲分述如後：</p>
<p>（一）預算收支不能平衡問題，在蘇省精華薈萃之二區，實不應有此現象，即有亦爲靑黃不接時之短暫現象，財廳當可向糧食部預借田賦實物抵款，的有五十億元左右，即將平均分配各縣市匯應急，惟明年度預算之編造，務必量入爲出，並在管敎養衛發展原則下，擺定工作重心，自訂百分比，以求平衡。</p>
<p>（二）應付緊急支付之臨時費問題，偶然不敷可向公庫挪借，省方當另定各縣市預備費之伸縮尺度，至於江南淸剿匪經費，茍在二百萬至四百萬元之範圍內，可先行動用，再報省核支。</p>
<p>（三）鄕鎭自治經費問題，過去無的款撥補，以致就地籌募，成爲民生疾苦　結之一，最近省方已規定在契稅中附徵契價百分之一，作鄕鎭監征費，而以此項收入之百分之七十，移充原鄉鎮經費，餘百分之三十由縣統籌撥補偽僻鄕鎭之經費，故今後絕不准就地攤派，惟茍遇地方必要之建設事業費用，提經鄕　民代表大會通過，列入縣預算，則姑准　募。</p>
<p>（四）縣市辦公不敷問題，由省統籌調整。</p>
<p>（五）財政稅務人員不敷問題，可酌量添雇，惟經臨各費以不超渦稅收百分之十五爲原則。</p>
<p>（六）縣市稽征處應與地籍處密切聯繫，人民辦理產權登記，須先領新契，始可價發所有權證書。至六時暫告段落，十四日整天檢討公庫制度，公有款產，及鄕鎭造產之整理。</p>

<p>〔本報鎭江十三日電〕據悉：蘇北收復區農民，前在共軍佔領時分得土地者，近紛紛自動將田地退還原業主。淮陰淮安高郵寳應與化均有如此現象。據熟悉農情者談：此輩農民退還土地之動機有三：（一）因蘇北佃農五口之家，非耕種卅畝以上之土地不能爲生，今倚賴暴刀結果，每人最多分很二畝半，几須負担公糧雜稅，得不償失，實非所願。（二）蘇北過去雖有少數奴役佃農之大地主，但大多數之主佃，尙能相依爲命。（三）佃農畏懼地主報復，且恐喪失耕種權益。聞當高郵城內馬姓佃戶爲退還田地被拒時，若干佃農竟伏地垂涕而請。</p>

<p>漕鎮居民抗議歧視</p>
<p>我們滬西的漕河涇鎭，戰前原有公共汽車電話等交通設備，淪陷時期被敵寇摧毀殆盡，勝利以還，迭向各有關常局籲請恢復建設，可是都因經費支絀，材料缺乏，未能實現。其中尤以公共汽車未恢復行駛，致使一般往來於滬漕之問的民眾備嘗跋涉之勞。本年七月間，經本鎭居民聯名函請祥生交通公司，就原有之滬龍（龍華）段汽車路綫，擴展至漕河涇鎭，承該公司同意，增撥車輛加班行駛，數月以來民衆稱便。不料自本月七日起，該公司突將滬漕段路綫的專車，宣佈停駛，其原因爲公用局要向該公司徵收營業總入的十分之三的養路費，還要百分之　的甚麽費，惟該公司每日賣　收入不過二三十萬元，需要　輛車子及工作人員十餘人，利潤很少。對養路等費用無力照納。不料公用局認爲公司方面「藐視法令」就請警察去強制他們停止通車。按之我們漕河涇鎭的公共建設，當局尙未列入預算之中，一切交通，衛生，路燈等建設都要地方上自籌自辦，這次對祥生公司的一種措施，未免太歧視了我們鎮上的民衆。希望公用局應立即以本局的車輛來繼續在這條路綫上行駛，不要任其斷絕交通，市民幸甚，社會幸甚。</p>

<h3>四強外長已獲致協議　特港問題僵局打開　聽由義南兩國直接談判　以不背和會決議爲條件</h3>
<p>〔　國新聞社紐約十三日電〕四外長會議昨日已就最棘手之特里埃斯問題成立協議，政治　　　綫因而明朗。僵局之打開，由於蘇聯外長莫洛托夫表示妥協態度所致。按四外長開會的　　接到義大利之備忘錄一件，法國代表繆維爾當在會議席上喚起各外長注意義國備忘錄之重要性。經長時間辯論後決定三點：（一）巴黎和會關於特港自中區及其地位之決定，當予維持。（二）西外長會議歡迎義大利與南斯拉夫經中直接談判所可成立之任何協議，但以此項協議不違反巴黎利會決議爲條件。（三）四外長會議於本月十三日起，逐點討論法國所擬之特港計劃。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十三日電〕四强外長昨夜決定於討論特港方案時，以法國之建議草案爲出發點，四外長今日將就該方案逐條討論，其中主要之點乃第五·六·七及八諸款，各該款均已經巴黎和會以三分之二之大多數通過，其所規定者均爲自由區總督之職權。第六款規定總督得建議有關聯合國安理會在自由區內之責任之立法，總督並得否決違背此項責任之立法，第七款授權總督得向特港政府委會之會議提出意見，第八條規定總督有控制自由區公共秩序與安全，處理外交事務，任命或罷免司法官吏之權。蘇外長莫洛托夫昨表示第七條可以不經修改即予接受，　八條完全不能接受，以總督權限過大，有背民主精神。今是外長會議之經濟專家開始討論義賠款之分配於蘇聯以外之他國，各條約關於前敵國境內保險權之附則，英國所提關於羅馬尼亞境內外國油權之附則。及芬關和的內收復財產之規定等。</p>

<h3>邱吉爾發表演說　抨擊蘇控制歐陸　重申建立歐洲合衆國之主張</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十二日電〕英國前任首相邱吉爾，本日在下院繼英王喬治六世宣讀詔書之後發表演說，力言國際局勢，前途黯淡。其言略謂，世界局勢迄未改善，猶憶去年舉行普選時，吾人相信工黨政府必能與蘇聯保持特別友好關係，詎意目前英蘇關係日趨惡化，英美兩國駐在歐洲之軍隊，業已逐步减少，而蘇聯駐在歐洲之軍隊，仍保特其强大之實力，且犬半仍依照戰時編制，殊値注意。目前歐陸三分之一以上，係在蘇聯控制之下，蘇聯西陲邊界已至易北河，法國將來命運若何，此際殊難逆料。以言聯合國機稱，其成就遠較吾人所預期者爲少，但反對派仍與工黨政府一致僞其後盾，貝文外相業已竭盡其所能，反對派亦已竭力支持貝文外相。關於歐洲合衆國，余仍主張必須予以組織，並力言歐洲之團結，爲世界機構與聯合國機構之柱石，及建立世界機構之原則。至於德國人民反對盟國佔領而怨聲載道一事而倫，吾人極願德國人民咸能自謀生計，並能處理其本身之事務。</p>
<p>處理巴勒斯坦　政府因循坐誤</p>
<p>關於巴勒斯坦問題，余認爲政府缺乏明確之政策，致使巴勒斯坦遭遇不幸，吾人倘若不能實施吾人向猶太復國運動人士所提供之諾言，則吾人應即將代管權移交聯合國機構，聯合國機構倘能接受吾人之建議，則吾人肩上之重担當可解除，而由各國共同負祖，美國倘若不贊成此種步驟，則應以人力及金錢援助吾人。吾人旣欲放棄印度，而又與猶太人作戰，以期將巴勒斯坦畀予阿拉伯人，此其所爲，實屬矛盾至極，此外，反對派要求議會在聖誕節前，討論印度問題。</p>
<h3>艾德禮答覆　不以國家安全作賭</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十二日電〕邱吉爾本日在下院發表攻擊政府演說後，現任首相艾德禮立即加以答覆，重申其於去年所發表之聲明，即「片面放棄帝國優惠問題並不存在。」並謂，邱吉爾氏對於巴勒斯問題指摘各節，殊足令人扼腕。關於此一問題，前途困難雖多，但吾人並不因循坐誤，習人以委任統治國職實所在，必須兼顧阿拉伯及猶太人之地位，吾人並會竭誠努力，取得美國之合作。以言英國目前之地位，則已因現代戰爭之發展而更易遭遇攻擊。吾人並非歐洲之一部分，將來一且戰事發生，殆將無喘息餘地，故吾人必須訓練後備軍，俾將來戰爭爆發時，毋需再經六閱月之訓練，即可作戰。片面裁减軍備，決不能予吾人之以安全，吾人苟欲獲得安全，則必須全世界樹立秩序。目前吾人之進展不若預期之速，良以吾人不能以國家之安全作賭故也。</p>
<h3>英兵役計劃</h3>

<h3>日對華停戰條件　欲在華北駐兵廿五年　太平洋戰前曾向美提出</h3>

<p>國際法庭所提證件</p>
<p>（一）十月十六日之木戶日記，載近衛向日皇提出辭職書，內稱：「日美交涉尙有成立希望，被視爲最大難關之撤兵問題，倘捨名而取實，尙有妥協希望，故突入大戰爭一事，實爲臣文磨之所難，而東條陸相主張開戰不已，臣遂不能盡輔弼之重責」云云。（一）東條口供：問，近衛內閣瓦解前後，你感覺對美國及其他三國有宣戰之必要乎？答，感覺有失却開戰良機之危險。問，關於對美國送達最後通諜一事，閣員問有意見相左者乎？答，意見一致認爲應於攻擊前送交美方，送交時間由參謀總長及軍令部長決定問，但宣戰詔書乃於攻擊珍珠港十一小時後頒布，你不否認乎？答，不否認。（一）十一月四日東鄕致駐美大使野村訓令：向美提出日本之最後提案，即承認通商之平等，日本對三國同盟無擴大自衛權之意。關於撤兵問題，「俟中日和平成立，除華北·內·海南島外，在兩個月內撤兵，上述三地則駐兵廿五年，越南則於和平達到時撤兵。（一）十一月廿七日，野村及來栖致東京電：交涉殆無成功希望，總統已對日皇發出電報，除非日皇回電，僵局已不能打開。交涉一旦破裂，對美英戰爭即不能避免。（一）十一月廿七日，來梄與外務省美國局長山本之國際電話由美方截聽者，</p>
<p>日方電話隠語甚多</p>
<p>山本謂：「婚事怎樣了？（日美交涉如何）」來栖：「你還沒有收到電報嗎？那是七點鐘送出去的，和梅子小姐（國務卿赫爾）昨天所講的沒有兩樣。」其次談及日軍進駐越南成爲問題。來栖：「一時婚事好像有成功的樣子（協定似有可能）」來栖：「你怎樣？孩子要生下來嗎？（危機迫近乎）」。山木：「快要生下來了」。來栖驚問：「從那方面？」忽覺此語有毛病，乃急謂：「是男的還是女的？」山本笑謂：「好像生下了很壯的男孩子。今天對君子小姐（羅斯福總統）的話有沒有聲明？」來栖：「沒有」。山本：「前天那件事還沒有決定，但實行很困難。關於結婚禮，請你不要打斷（請繼續交涉）」來栖：「盡我的力量做好了。不遇空手是沒有法子的，對方還希望繼續談婚事，但是不是道邊却爲臨盆興奮着？而且德川（陸軍）已經忍耐不住了？」山本：「總之，山是不能賣掉的（不能讓步）」。</p>
<h3>日賠償會議　下月初在美召開</h3>

<h3>蘇代表檢舉日議員　艾其森要求提證據　管日委會美蘇又起激辯</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十三日電〕盟國管制日本委員會本日開會時，蘇聯代表特萊夫揚柯不滿日本現政府，並檢舉日本衆議員十七名，謂此輩會參加東條主持之大政　贊會，劣跡昭著，應依照麥帥本年一月頒佈之整肅令，予以罷黜。特氏甚至對日本現首相吉田茂亦不肯放鬆。據稱：吉田最近曾在其官邸召集日本出版家數人，討論資助作家所著故近衛公爵之傳記出版。查此作家以前從事侵略著作，各該出版家則已在肅清之列。吉田甘與勾結，未知用意何在？按蘇聯直接攻擊日本政治家，此爲首次。管制委會主席美代表艾其森起　辯護，要求特氏提出證據，略謂：「吾人鼓勵日本採納民主，莫如吾人行動先民主化。蘇聯代表之意見或與人大相逕庭，但彼須認識：若無具體事實，不能譴責任何人。遠東國際法庭之設立，即本於此種原則，而蘇聯亦列爲法官之一。故若謂此輩議員以前會爲某團體會員，遽而加以罷黜，理由未足，應提出且體之證據。特氏答稱：各該議員不僅爲侵略團體委員，且爲各該團體之領袖，依照整肅命令，應即慶黜。至此特氏乃宣讀原令之數節，以爲佐證。中國代表朱世明將軍似與蘇聯見解從同，謂以前草率甄別之日本官吏與議員，應宣重行甄別；但聲明僅爲一種意見。英美代表則表明佔領警局對肅清日人，一向審愼從事。會後被檢舉議員之一，即自由　愛人　田語記者稱：「蘇聯代表今晨扮演日本共產黨發言太之角色，余一向受共黨攻擊，日本共產黨之幕後，有蘇聯主持，於此乃大白矣。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕當美商米高梅公司呈請在滬建造第一流電影院之議案經市政會儀通過後，吳市長曾對記者表示，謂所以予以通過之一部分原因，在於可以刺激本市之建築事業，因勝利之後，本市尙未有如此浩大之建築物動工，若米高梅公司影院落成，必將予本市建築界一大刺激。昨據市工務局營造處王處長語記者稱：光復後，本市確尙未有工程浩大之建築物問世，現向工務局登記者。僅美商上海電話公司一家，該公司因原有之江西路辦公處不敷應用，故擬新建大厦一所，可能建造之地點計有四處：（一）江西路漢口路轉角，即現市府大厦對過之空地，（二）江西路漢口路口，現紅禮拜堂後之草地上，（三）福州路行總辦事處，（四）四馬路外灘，現國營招商局辦事處。現正由電話公司考慮中。</p>
<p>據工務局之意見，新屋地點最好在招商局現址，因該處靠近灘邊，故房屋之高度，可不受任何限制。然電話公司則擬選擇江西路漢口路口現市府對面之空地，因該處全爲空地，現市府關作停車塲，故待決定後，立可動工興築，而其他三處，則尙須待地面上原有建築物之拆除也。但依據工務局之新屋建造原則，任何建築物之高度，不得超過該路面闊度一倍半。而電話公司因業務上之需要，必須造一高達十七層之大厦，則非建於外灘不可。現電話公司負責人正與工務局方面積極商討中，於下星期中，必可作最後之決定。</p>
<p>又據工務局營造處之統計：去年勝利後，自九月份至十二月份止，該局核發之營業執照僅七十六起，而今年一月起，至十月底止，已達七百餘起，且向該局請領營造執照者，月有增加。其中以市房佔多數，爲二百七十餘宅，住宅决之，爲二百二十餘幢，貨棧與工廠又次之，此外尙有戲院七所，校舍十所，及公寓，浴室，茶坊，酒肆等各數起。</p>

<h3>德戰犯嫌疑沈克等六人　美軍法庭宣判無罪　因案情尙與聯合國有關宣布仍還押　其餘各要犯將賡續審訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕歐哈德局總嫌疑戰犯二十七人經美軍法庭審訊累月，其中對於沈克，格里許，沃托，荷爾門，斯多勒，蘭杜等六人突於昨日宣吿無罪，惟首席檢察官奧康納即宣佈此六人將仍由美軍聶押，因中英或其他聯合國家可能亦將對彼等起訴，且至少彼等均係納粹組織之一份子，或應押返德國受鞫。</p>
<p>按美軍法庭所欲裁定者僅係一九四五年八月德國投降以後被吿等爲害美國之行爲，起訴中控吿此六人爲納粹遠東情報機關歐哈德局之間諜，於德國投降後，繼續從事不利於美國之軍事活動，並供給日本軍隊及情報機關各種協助情報，宣傳及物資等破壞德國之無條件投降。</p>
<p>其中沈克被控爲曾受德統帥部特殊訓練之「第一號間諜」，先後在重慶及中國沿海城市活動。不久以前合衆社駐華辦事處，經理倫道爾曾因揭露沈克之間諜活動而爲沈克控訴於我地方法院，結果宣判倫道爾無罪，沈克不服，上訴高等法院，仍遭敗訴。</p>
<p>格里許係廣州德僑之領袖，被控搜集谷種關於美國及其盟國海陸空各方面活動情報供給日軍。</p>
<p>沃托係華南納粹組織之首領，被控罪狀與格里許類同。</p>
<p>荷爾門係駐僞府大使，控狀中指彼爲歐哈德之上司。</p>
<p>斯多勒係駐僞大使館上海辦事處首長，亦被控爲歐哈德上司。　蘭杜則係駐偽府之上海領事，被控爲歐哈德之直屬上司。</p>
<p>此次宣吿六人無罪係由於被告辯護律師聲請釋放所有二十七被吿之結果，被吿律師提出抗議理由凡三點：（一）德國投降條款不適用於各被吿，（二）起訴書中所控被吿各點並未破壞德國投降，（三）控訴方面提供之證據不够充份。</p>
<p>對於第一點庭上予以駁斥，蓋德國投降係無條件投降，昨僅限乎軍隊，而應適川於任何德國國民。格里許等六人之宣吿無罪係基於其餘兩項抗議。　至於歐哈德及其餘各被吿將仍繼續受審，並已定於今晨八時再度開庭。</p>

<h3>英輪懸萬國船旗　路人又誤爲日幟　外部調查日船進口事件</h3>
<p>昨日下午三時五十分左右，有重約萬噸之銀灰色運輸船一艘，桅桿上扯方形紅白色各半之旗幟，相距的二尺之下端，另懸一三角形之膏藥旗，駛經外灘時，途人皆駐足而觀，僉誤認此爲日本船隻，並驚訝當局因何任令懸膏藥旗之船隻再出現於浦江，但旋經記者向江海關探悉，此所懸之紅白旗及三角形膏藥旗，乃爲萬國船旗，並非日本旗，紅白方形旗乃代替「H」字碼，三角膏藥旗代替「I」字，並悉該船爲英國運輸船，於昨日下午進口，現已停泊於公和祥碼頭云。又關於日船進口事件，已引起我外交部注意，當時曾有電致該部駐滬辦事處査詢，並已由滬辦事處主任陳國廉將調査經過之事實電復外交部，茲探錄該兩電原文如下：（一）外交部來電云：「據海軍司令部參謀長電話稱，日船第四日力丸阻滯吳淞口，掛日人駕駛符號，未懸日本旗，應否准許進口等語，該船來華任務，及國籍如何，是否已獲盟軍總部許可，又此種船舶之進口，有無與我國任何方面洽定，請向海關及其他機關査明眞相，並將辦理經過報部。」（二）上海外交部辦事處陳國廉復電「外交部次長鈞鑒，關於日船第四日力丸來滬事，鈞部本月八日來第二十八號奉悉，經向海軍指揮部査詢，據魏司令稱令該船係由日人駕駛之日本商船，經麥克阿瑟總部許可，運載中央信託局交換物資本材由日來滬，本部（海軍指揮部）准予進口」云云。</p>
<h3>食鹽貸款</h3>
<p>總額超過百分之七十</p>
<p>上海區食鹽貸款，由中國銀行領導組織銀團，工作展開異常順利，其貸款總額已超過百分之七十以上？運銷方面，押匯及押款共計一二〇萬市擔，金額爲一百卅二億元。地區分靑島，連雲港，福建各地，分運魯，淮，閩地食鹽至湘，鄂，皖，贛，豫等省銷售，在接洽貸放者，尙佔有七十億元左右，按銀團對運銷貸款部份，其總額爲一六八億元，嗣因膩　　局以豫省需要食畫孔　。要求增加，担定每月十萬市擔，並定三個月爲週轉，共運卅萬擔，增加貸款四十億元，共爲二○八億元，至生產貨款，原定四四億元，已向兩浙　塲貸放一四億兀，福建九億元，又目下鹽價，以運費增加，在短期內將由鹽務總局報呈四聯總處，依照目前成本，調　貸額，以副七折押款。（前每擔食鹽市價約一萬九千元，故押價爲一萬三千元，現成本兩萬四千元，　爲有提高押之必要）據　中人云：自銀團組織後，統筹辦理，在銷區存　固屬毋缺，但可免充塞過剩，故　商業務漸臻穩定，縱無暴利可圖，但可維持虧耗，與以前鹽商貸款每爲有力者獨攬，小型鹽商，不能偏佔者，逈不相同。又悉：現値江水枯落，大批鹽斤，麕集漢口一帶，以應冬銷旺季，預料今年軍民所需鹽斤，可保無虞。</p>

<h3>油價問題　配油下週起實行　社會局將召開油價會議　今日起門害商办理登記</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食油昨以到貨不多，而民营廠配油不足，邃又造成客商居奋機會。各檔食油市價，又告土漲。茲悉：配油原則巳定。自下週一起，除由國食油公司及中國植物油廠侮月各有食油一萬担，直接派交各食油零售商門售外。各民營廠每月亦決定撥出食油一萬二千担參加配售。故今後本市每月經常有食油三萬二千担配售，油便當可平穩。昨日壯會局以油市又起漲風，曾勸踰各客商勿特賞不售。聞各客商己遵論脫售，故今日油價，當可趨平。又社會局以耳前各檔食油議價，與成本稍有不符，將於十五日下午二時。召開食油議價會議。屆時出席者，有市政府，市社會局，市參議會，市商會，榨油廠公會，食油零售商么會，中國植物油廠等代表。</p>
<p>又本市雜糧油餅零售商察同業公會（即食油零售商公會），以自下週一起，每月又將配售民營廠食油一萬二千担，特自今日起，至十六止，每日自中十二時起，至下午六時止，辦理全市食油零售商登記。已入會者，辦理登記手續。未入會者，同時辦理入會及登記手續。登記地點，在民國路三七號三樓該業公會會址。</p>
<h3>金價跌美鈔堅穩</h3>
<p>烚赤昨疲從仍穩形勢多盤，最開二四四萬五，開後自二四五萬械右雖饑至二四六萬五，始有供源，多方知難而退，效因配給關係，實銷興戶見淡，而步至二四二萬二，始獲維持，稍告上升，十時後央行以二四二萬五之價，配給二〇〇條，此後買氣又漸股切，的午時供源又寂回升至二四六萬，午從初升綢回，隔日交割者尚無特變，較封關前回小一萬八，飾金平紋銀亦無更動，銀元微昂，睛拆銀根大鬆，暗息退至一角一至一角四。</p>
<p>外幣隨金市進退，初平後穩，　鈔初時爲四二七〇元至四三二〇元，中途曾低至四二五〇元左右，而午刻新買又來活動，再回升至四二七〇元買，四三二〇元賣，較封關前相差不多，港票初疲後回，結果較封關前回低五元，港匯平穩，八七〇元有勝，八八〇元有賣，印匯一〇五五元至一〇六五元，英匯一四〇五〇元至一四一五〇元，成交均稀，美匯牌價未更。</p>
<h3>外股升降不一</h3>
<p>外股昨小型尚現平定，大股彩勢不支，結果較封關前計怡紗英聯怡牌航業鋼業徽挫，紙業稍升，會德豐業置尚平。</p>
<h3>公債平穩</h3>
<p>公債昨撚牌因五樓某火戶受西商委托吸納而穩，統丙則大戶出入不一，尚乏特變，成交約五百萬元，統丙潑開一四五〇元，自一五〇〇元起逐步下退至一四〇〇元以下，始告穩定，最後仍在一四二〇元至一四五〇元之問　徊，結果較上週六微升十元，甲乙丁升起五十元，統戊則好起九十元。</p>
<h3>桐油銷路呆滯</h3>
<p>白桐浪自外銷不能合算，久無交易，而內銷因非常銷令，亦少成績，且現值新貨登塲之際，內外銷既未能暢通，市而當然難期振作，惟各江無因工資奋昂，雖去路不暢，面形勢仗見堅硬，蓋與百物價格而較，則桐油之倍數尚在嚴似限度，近日各處出數漸旺，所有去路，均是預備存積，實銷尚非其時也。絲之，匯率不改，外銷無發展可言，以現市而衡，縱不能望廠，亦難望轉好，祇有穩定而己，本市對外貿易沉寂己久，內銷汕定價每市担爲十二萬五千元，銷甚零落，洪江桐汕銷不婁令，存積尚原，冬銷寥寥，須待春銷，始有發展可望，各牌西副售每桶十萬〇五千元。</p>
<h3>燒喊軋缺市價紊亂</h3>
<p>本市燒喊，自美國禁止出口從，存底日薄，故二月來價格已上漲一價有餘，美貨扳價亦上漲一二倍，天津青島兩常，父復有大量吸胃，本週須收足三四千桶，並指定美貨，因之月牌價格，反比美貨爲低，而本市執貨者因感來源不易，多不願輕易脫乎，週一下午市場價格每桶三百公斤，喊價九十三萬元，但無多量成交，行商售出者，價噸參差，但均高於市場之喊價，昨市便格極度紊亂，有竟索價每補一百五十萬元方肯脫手者。</p>
<h3>開做遞交　關於所備及證金　繼紀人提出要求</h3>
<p>體交經紀人公會昨向所方提出要求，對遞交交易之常日軋平者，所佣應祗收一方，友存輪未滿一萬五千萬元者，不應再收保證金，逾額當照章繳紹，因各經紀人己繳納保證金五千萬元，所方不應在多事之秋，增加經紀人負担，並闻羅紀人表示，所方如不予客納，有全體拒做選交之可能云。</p>
<h3>華股　市況剛見轉機　又被時局沖淡</h3>
<p>華股昨以時局不定，人多臆測，開出均告見低，開後廣幫逢低　進，立起漲風，竟創高價，惟漲高時證券中大戶一再脫手，加之銀行幫亦出人俱見，十時後堅後轉盤，中途大起摻扎，乍起乍落，盤旋不已，然因刻關前一般多頭陸續獲利了結，形勢不甚堅挺，近午時檯面幫浮多及一、五一號等賣意興謝，跌勢加劇，除公司會數度漲至停限，應安則一度跌停，倫和雖跌而尚穩，餘者都辦疲態，午刻均在低檔盤旋，結果較對關前計熱股、永紗景福新光各跌少許，美亞跌半成，勤與獨跌一成牛，信和徽升，冷股火柴內大跌半成，五和跌成半，麗安新並小一成，餘者平定及微挫不等，午後傳聞共方代表返延安，及經紀人方面向所方提出要求，如所方不予採納，則全體有報做「遞交」之訊，散多徬徨，斬多蜂起，空方送威，各股不人續起跌勢，日變本加厲，形熱懮怯，勤興首光跌停，火熒維起，惟兩者不久即得維持，臨收各股都學盤旋，校對關前熱股永紗材和跌牛成，美亞景福新光各跌一成左右，動興跌舊一成牛，冷股，永公升半成，中紡統益新亞麗安跌一成，五和內衣火柴跌落成牛、餘者均有小拌，全日成交總額一七二四萬股，場外各股升降甚微。</p>
<h3>細紗現貨仍有黑市　棉布櫃銷活動趨勢仍平</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市，仍處於暗中摸索之狀態中，十支及十六支，照限價可能買得現貨，惟廿支以上各紗，欲照公定價購進，實屬難比登天，幫客幫添辦不得不得價收買，普通輕磅貨如廿支紅魁星金城，俱在二百零五六萬元之譜，超出限價念萬至卅萬之間，約較十一日高起三四萬，又重磅貨特雙馬，亦做至二百廿八萬，成交殊稀，因買賣雙方，均有所顧忌也。</p>
<p>布市平平，客幫納胃已减，本幫則以氣候轉冷，　銷稍形活動，交易以深色士林元嗶嘰爲旺，惟供量尙足，價格除士林，因顏料猛漲，略高一二千元外，餘均無甚上落，跳鯉漂布市塲交易較多，十二磅細布各廠存貨雖已走空，但補進原料，悉爲配給之紗，成本較輕，照目前價格，均願發售，是以一時殊鮮上漲趨勢，龍頭細布仍做八萬三千元，嗶嘰則喊九萬四千元云。</p>
<h3>美國物價上漲　定貨易起糾紛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近美國取消特價管制辦法，對我國進出口業方面，不無影響。記者爲特趨訪該業某俯視人氏，據談：美國取消特物價管制後，則美國物價趨勢當將上漲。影響所及，使進出口業方面若干筆已定交易，又將遽起變化。綠勝利後本市進出口行家，風起雲湧，迄目前已達六百餘家。若輩以美國廠商，大多已有特約或專高之駐華代理店，只得與國外之販賣商，或進出口行交易。普通交易，常恃一紙電報爲定。如定貨後價格趨漲，常有延不交貨之情事發生。此後如美國物價步漲，則類此情事必更多。亦有定貨時不開價，迨定貨裝船時，始以裝船時之發票價爲準。故今日之進口業，對定貨來價，實無法預爲匡計。渠稱：爲解決是項延不交貨之糾紛計，亟望中美間能速組貿易糾紛公斷委員會，以便公平處理中美間之一切貿易糾紛云。</p>
<h3>美棉續漲</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十二日電〕今日棉市交易稍呈小活躍，遠期棉花漲落互見。據私人消息稱：棉農仍在囤貨不脫手，以待善價而沽。確定期收盤最高漲每包二元一角，最低跌五角。又紐奧林斯十二日電，今日遠期棉花，因愛棉織品管制，刺激購買之影響，一致看漲。收盤漲每包五角至二元五角。</p>
<h3>潮青見新</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平定，公會劃盤現貨中砂白十三萬八千五百元，生砂赤十一萬八千元至十二萬元，油幫新黃崗　已有少數運到，昨開十一萬六千元，陳貨十一萬元，興化白十二萬三千元，興赤十二萬元至十一萬八千元，因天津幫動辦，故而轉升，開出二十　，刁　呌十一萬元未成交。</p>
<h3>茶市無甚進展</h3>
<p>冰莊茶市，祁門新紅茶，賣戶喊價每担達七八十萬元左右，難以成交，故英莊均改辦白琳新紅茶及祁門陳紅茶，至於抽珍，珍眉等綠茶，新貨售價奇昂，僅三數家出口行購進，聞印莊對於溫州新紅茶，土莊細紅茶，頗有胃納，刻下正擬積極向貨主磋商中。</p>
<h3>中信配售人絲經過　黑市買賣廠商作繭自縛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局代理出售政府物資財產委員會某負責人昨語記者是：該會自於上月十七日，擬就配售人造絲辦法十一條，付諸實施以來，即根據該項辦法，配售人絲。上月開始配售時，迄上月底爲止，共祗半個月。當按各絲織廠申請數額七折核配，計共配出一千〇卅餘箱。據確切估計：本市各絲織廠對人造絲之實際需要量，每月約爲二千五百箱。故本月份配售總額，諒不至少於該數。且如二批日本人造絲開到，或可設法增配。惟對每廠之核准配售額，該會早已照各廠之申請額及其實際需要量予以核定。該會每月開售人造絲八次，各廠得於其本身核准之領配額中，一次或八數次向該會開絲。茲查本月來，已開絲數次。而有若干廠商，業已有最初之一二次中，申購足額。惟該廠等偶遇黑市價高，即將申購所得之人造絲向黑市拋售圖利，然後再向該會申歲。該會以其已申購足額，當不能再予核配。該廠等以需要無著，逐又轉向黑市搜購，乃又造成黑市持貨者抬價之機會。是爲向黑市拋售牟利之各廠，自食其果。本會雖爲各申購廠商，偏欲作繭自縛，實屬「不識抬舉」云。現聞該會對轉售圖利各廠，正密切注意，必要時將予嚴厲之處分云。</p>
<p>昨日黑市仍見鋒俏</p>
<p>中信局配售人造絲繼續不斷，而黑市價仍步趨高翔，良以配售量不敷廠需，乃有此欲爺平而反高之現象，昨一二〇號天橋老裝有光，上午做到七十五萬元，做到六十一二萬元收盤，下得因有實銷戶採購，頗有交易，以致更復做高，老裝竟喊達九十萬元，新裝做七十五萬元，比週一大起三十萬元左右。其他各號雜牌半光漲二十萬元。獨有一五〇號有光無去胃，價仍喊週一原盤，未做開。廠比昨略有成交，C字等　稍有疵病值得，做價三百六十萬元，市上普通高檔新貨另担，喊價亦在三百六十萬元之間，綢貨昨無甚變動，只有花錦　羽紗，稍大五十元，不過原料仍在高漲，綢貨價亦難維持原狀也。</p>
<h3>糖價審議會開會　中砂售十三萬元</h3>
<p>市社會局昨日下午三時舉行第八次糖價審議會，經決定要　五件：（一）食糖價格決定中砂十三萬元，生砂十一萬元，（二）戶口購糖證，各區如有多餘則繳還，不足則補發，（三）規定麻袋之標準份量，由社會局，民政處，南貨業公會，會同實地調查決定，（四）鄉區　花江　新市街等區之戶口配糖事宜，決定由民政處南貨業公會負責補辦，（五）下次配糖事宜，由下次會議討論決定。</p>

<h3>米市到湧銷滯　油價仍舊不變</h3>
<p>湘米又有二千包運到</p>
<p>米市昨南北河下共到一萬五千餘石，消化依然呆滯，實因高利貸之下，工廠行號備存糧食之宗旨，均已打消，是以購買力益淡，市勢一蹶不振，慘跌不已，北粳　見猛挫二三千元，南粳續跌三四千元，羊埠秈亦帶小千元，　秈亦成呆疲少交，白元隊元亦降一二千元，黃豆油廠閩方稍見動辦，市形堅挺，豆餅南冰略進，市面回升二三百元，後形仍看各埠消化爲轉移，麩皮回小一二百元，麵粉來貨略增，去胃甚淡，步跌三四百元，油市各廠配出三百担，價格仍舊，塲外無成交，蠶豆趨勢定局，赤豆高貨尙可，中次乏神，仍居提高殺次，紅糧回小三五百元，芝蔴貨稀挺秀，生仁廣幫納胃蟬聯，續漲二三千元，苞米青島揀高拾取。</p>
<p>又訊，湘米略有到埠，昨日三北公司明興輸由漢到滬烟葉五百餘件，湘米二千包，經漢轉運來滬。</p>
<h3>複配會嚴防虛報</h3>
<p>設置密告箱歡迎投函檢舉　設交換處同業得互相掉換</p>
<p>複制品業棉紗轉配會，自辦理配紗以來，工作極爲緊張，惟以同業會員眾多，其製造廠地處散漫，情形複雜，對申報生產動力及需要數量，難免有浮報套襲之嫌，爲防止此項弊端起見，除派員分別調查外，特再公告，並置密告箱，於該會門口，歡迎檢舉，茲錄要點如次：</p>
<p>（一）凡發現同業申報生產機器及開工率不確者，將配到棉紗轉售牟利者，加入兩個公會冒領配紗者，均得來會密告；</p>
<p>（二）向本會密告請正式具函簽名蓋章，封面注明「密」字，投入密告箱內；</p>
<p>（三）密告函郵本人理事長自行啓封，對內外嚴守秘密。</p>
<p>又該會以各同業配到之紗，未能普通適用，致發生發還情事，特呈准紡管會，成立棉紗交換處，詳細辦法，業已奉准，人選問題，仍由該會會員兼任，業已分函各同業會員，先行辦理登記事宜，其交換辦法價格等，均依照紡管會核定辦理，該項機構，完全辦理同業互相交換事務，以配到之紗，如有不能適用者，由該會斟酌，互相掉換，其支數及價格差額，則依照棉紗折算方法補退款項。</p>

<h3>合作工廠具體化　兩大問題待商决　組織問題與分紅辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市社會局，社會部。全國合作供銷處上海分處，中國蠶絲公司，三機關定明日開會，商討絲綢合作工廠之組織計劃。大致三機關分工合作，社會局將負組織監督之責。供銷處負產品外銷之責；中蠶則於資金方面，多作貢獻，並主張於工廠成立之初，准許外界私人投資，使其資力充實，易於辦好。聞此項意見，已爲上兩機關所贊成。將來四廠之機器資產，將估價作爲官股，再由工人酌認股份，作爲民股。至於管理方面，有主張應依據。合作社之原則，由社員大會爲最高權力機關者，亦有認爲此法不妥，而主張應按照一般之公司組織法，成立理監事者以上兩種意見，明日會議時當可決定，又工廠之分紅辦法，將爲明日開會時引起熱烈之討論。一派意見主張依股份之大小而分紅，但社會局代表對此辦法，堅決反對。認爲合作工廠之目的，即在使工人有「主人」之感覺，須提高其自尊性與責任，以消弭工潮於無形之中。管理上採用普通公司之制度，已爲不得已之辦法；故在分紅上，必須保持合作社之精神，使工人能得最大之利益，否則「合作」兩字，將有名而無實，工廠仍將發生勞資糾紛。至於報酬外界之私人投資，可在贏餘中專提一部；但工人之紅酬百分比，至少當爲百分之四十。有關人士指出：合作工廠如能眞正辦好，則有四大優點：（一）澈底消弭工潮，（二）樹立工資標準，得爲其他國營民營工廠之參考，而使目前生活指數之爭執，成爲不必要。（三）因工人自覺的努力，可提高生產量。（四）工人爲工廠之主人，不致受人剝削，生活標準得以提高。</p>

<h3>小學運動會第二日　團體操表演成績優異　大會琯今日下午閉幕</h3>
<p>第十屆全市小學聯合運動會，昨爲大會第二日，節目集中於團體操及田徑複決賽，秋風突起，但小英雄仍精神抖擻。大會會長市敎育局局長顧毓琇氏，特於昨日下午一時，親臨會場視察，各健兒更爲振奮。昨日全日，自晨九時起，迄午後五時止，團體操及各項田徑預複决賽，分別舉行，各參加團體操之學校，皆以熟練整齊之操作，展演於萬餘觀衆之前。中以羣化小學之丹麥操，獲得好評，爲評判組譽爲優美者，他如飛虹小學之收稻舞，以最低年齡之幼稚小天使，加入表演，殊屬難能，位育小學之體育皇后，以服裝鮮艷華麗，動作敏捷，道中女中，更以音樂伴奏之健身操，及民智小學之努力合作中，以小天使化裝男女老少，與各種動物，尤爲突梯滑稽，爲大會生色。昨日團體操表演第一項目，爲阜春總校幼稚生表演洋娃娃舞蹈。一對對男女孩子各抱洋娃娃，於琴聲鏗鏘中，緩步登塲，手拍洋娃娃，圍繞校旗，走成圓形，載歌載舞，取材新穎別致，深合敎育理想。大會定今日下干五時閉慕。</p>

<h3>仁餘昨晚敗得可惜　黑白隊勝爲甚險　蕭華陀最後一擲起死回生　結果卅八比卅七相差一比</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕菲島華僑籃球又一勁旅黑白隊，昨晚初展身手，下午六時半出戰仁餘隊於市體育館，戰來不甚得手，於最後一分鐘，幸賴蕭華陀之一擲，才得轉敗爲勝，形勢甚爲危急，最後比數三十八比卅七分，上半時仁餘以二十二比十八佔先四分，仁餘自始至終，一路領先，惜不能於最後維持勝局，深爲可惜。</p>
<p>黑白表現未臻理想</p>

<h3>一座死城的復活　…東臺收復前後…</h3>
<p>— 本報泰縣記者凌松壽</p>
<p>四日東臺訊</p>
<p>照李天霞師長的預定計劃，準備於十月底收復東台；可是事實的表現，却提早了四天。這一下，更增强了他對他那袋中的「法寳」（預定行動計劃圖）的信任。</p>
<p>本來廿五日國軍收復梁垜後，前鋒越過三里庵，距東台城僅十三華里；而左翼部隊在東台城西南方最大據點——武神廟，又給了共軍一個嚴重的打擊；早知道共軍在東台絕無繼續抵抗的餘力，其所以遲遲不退者，不過爲了延長一點時間，加强他搜括搶運的工作罷了。</p>
<p>白天不開門　晚間敷衍點門面</p>
<p>記者二十七日在海安，淸早聽軍務處工處長吿訴我東台已經收復，隨即專車赴梁垜，次日晨，隨着八十三師師部來到東台。</p>
<p>東台城郊要比泰縣大得多，一條大街，足有七華里路長。在初到的一天，街上却顯得怪冷淸地。店門全開的很少，從店門朝貨架上看，都是很少很少的一點貨物放在架子上，甚至空的也有，尤以綢布店爲然。記者歇足於一家油店裏，和他們店裏諸位談了一下。據他們說：「在共軍統制之下經營商業，是不容易的一回事。他們辦有合作社，不管任何買賣，都要受他們節制，好的營業，全由他壟斷；但是一有不討便宜的事情，他馬上就來找你。明明市價只有二萬元一石的豆子，他偏要二萬五千元；而磨出的油，却由他們平價收買，輾轉獲利。」油店老闆問我，「他說商人是剝削階層；可是他對商人的這一套手段，又是什麼呢？」爲了「抗幣」的「價値」（？）搖動，人民漸漸地存了戒心。幾側月來，一般商店也不想做什麽生意，情願關的，而共軍爲了繁榮市面，又不准這樣做。國軍由海安北進，政府飛機不時到東台巡視，散傳單；商店藉口防空，樂得白天不開門，晚間做一兩個鐘點營業，敷衍了事。所以在未收復前，東台是變成了一座死城；一直到國軍進駐後才甦醒過來。</p>
<p>交通漸恢復　還鄉客每日千人</p>
<p>記者到束台一個星期當中，很明白地看出東台在向着復興的路程中一天一天地邁進着。每天從外埠還鄕的流亡人士，起碼有一千餘人；東台泰縣間的水上交通，又已恢復；一批批的貨物，向着東台搬運，充實了商店的貨架，也充實了東台的商塲；在共軍盤踞期間，不營業的旅館，酒樓，現在也都復業了。新店開張，舊店復業的，日益增多。縱有未曾恢復營業的店舖，不是因爲店主逃亡未歸，就是採辦的貨物尙未抵達；他們在政府的溫煖懷抱中，將還要爲建育設新東台而努力。</p>
<p>由於交通不便和物資缺乏兩大原因，小攤版在東台街頭便非常活躍。他們大都向南通或泰縣販運一般零星洋貨銷售，各貨售價起先很大，如馬立斯香烟在泰州賣一千元一包，在這裏要一千八百元。但三天來，因來貨漸湧，普通價格，也不過比泰縣增加二成。其他日用必需品售價，經縣商會會議評定施行，大米每石三萬二千元，稻草每担三千元，猪肉每斤一千六百元，煤油每斤八百元，靑菜每斤卅元，白開水每　十元；商民倒尙能體貼政府意旨，奉命准謹，一周內幷無過火的波動。</p>
<p>不藏「抗幣」　不等它變成廢紙</p>
<p>提到商塲，便聯想到通貨問題。不久以前，曾有人對共軍遺留下來的「抗幣」，認爲是一件値得討論的問題。可是就記者十幾天來在東綫各收復區所得到的印象而論，覺得這幷不是怎樣嚴重的一回事。（當然，這或許僅是東綫如此，他處情形容或特殊。）老百姓受着共產黨的壓迫，不得不在國土上使用政府規定以外的一種通貨；然而他們看得最淸楚，儘管共產黨說得天花亂墜，他們絕不會收一藏大量的「抗幣」放在家中，等着他變成廢紙。至於商店方面，前而說過，他們根本不想做生意，即使積有「抗幣」，他們早在國軍進駐的前夕燒去了；曾有一位老闆向記者說：「只要國軍來，其餘還講什麽呢？這一點投失，比被他們（指共軍）鬥爭得精光總要好些吧？」　目前在商塲上普遍成到困難的，倒是法幣的缺乏。在國軍一到東台時，街上交易差不多都是以部隊爲主體，東台人與東台人之間的交易簡直沒有。記者曾聽一家主婦說：「連買小菜的錢都沒有！」現在缺乏的情形雖能好轉一點，低離開「週轉靈活」的程度還相差好遠。當然，銀行的推進，確有種種困難，可是我們終不能白白看着一個剛收復的城市的商塲就這樣死板板地弄下去。前天聽李師長說，如果法幣問題實在不能解決的時候，他準備由軍需處暫撥若千現款交由縣商會運用。不過這僅是權宜的辦法，主要的期待，仍是銀行界之復員。</p>
<p>走訪張專員　徵詢收復區問題</p>
<p>收復區土地問題，報紙上也曾有過一番討論。有的主張借水行舟，即以收復區爲模範，實現初步的平均地權。有的主張緩和辦理，好讓飽經大刦的人民，舒一口氣。照最近國防最高委員會通過的「綏靖區施政綱領」，即是根據後者而制定。記者爲此特走訪第六行政區張專員，詢以對土地問題的意見。張專員認爲上述的制度很能適合收復區的民情習慣，實足表現政府體恤民艱之至意。專員幷認爲土地問題，在蘇北將沒有重大的料紛。第一，中國民風素厚；尤其是刦後殘生，相憐同病，彼此間絕不會有侵佔冒領等情事發生。第，地主對田地所右權的證據，不會全都沒有；而且蘇北又以自耕農居多數，村落聚居，子孫相替，田地之所有權或其疆界，不僅地主極淸楚，村鄰也甚明瞭，雖欲侵佔冒領而不可能。</p>
<p>另外關於民衆的報復問題，記者曾向有關方面徵詢意見，大家覺得照山國人的習性忍讓，對於少數不良份子，或尙不至有任何報復舉動。不過爲防患未然起見，消極方面，常局仍應切實宣傳，切實剴諭，務使相解相諒，不起糾紛；積極方面，政府應趕快在收復區設立法院。俾使發生糾紛時，能求得公平的解決。</p>
<h3>老百姓說　黑暗的日子過了　國軍帶來了溫暖與光明</h3>
<p>東合城區因無重大戰事發生，故表面上破壞尙少可是六年來敵僞的壓榨，再加上一年多共軍的蹂躪，我們不難想像到東台現在是如何地顯着外强中乾的現象。戰事的破壞，記者數經富安，安豐，梁垜等地災雜遍野，眞是慘不忍睹。在溱潼到東台的一段，如時埝，武神廟附近的村落，胥經共軍縱火，居民流離失所；此外共軍又大肆殺人，在溱潼之北鄉村間，被害着即有二千餘人之衆，凡此一切，在在需要政府從速地展開賑濟工作！</p>
<p>隨着國軍的進駐，東台電燈廠也恢復送火，藉着這一點，給東臺添了不少的生氣。老百姓說：「黑暗的日子過了，國軍帶給了我們以溫暖，帶給了我們以光明！」</p>
<p>爲着繁榮市面，安定民心，李師長很關心地方上正當娛樂的發展。他囑地方行政當局要籌設劇院，電影院，使人民在刦後能嚐到一點兒太平時代的風味。李師長永遠是這樣的藝術化，時代化；在戰塲上他離開不了一架電影機。前幾天師長曾招待各將領和記者看抗戰片「大路」；主席誕辰的那天，又在公共塲所放映新聞片「蔣夫人訪美」等，老百姓無不歡天喜地，他們說：「國軍們的還是國軍啊！」師部新年代劇團，才在泰縣演罷「國家至上」「大地黃金」，又風塵僕僕地趕到這海濱的古城，準備公演某劇，來安慰安慰受盡了苦的東台人們。</p>
<p>百舉待整理　擴大點綫的收穫</p>
<p>東台收復，僅僅是一個點綫的收穫，地方行政，在此復員伊始之時，百舉待理。張專員對記者列舉四大要綱，即：（一）城防工事之鞏固，（二）地方武力之充實。（三）保甲戶口之整編，（四）軍政配合之加强。然而施政之初，無往而不需經濟；而「提到地方財政，又是一件令人頭痛的事情。按照規定地方財政應由田賦及自治捐稅項下抵撥。東台縣長費均氏縐着眉頭向記者說：「莫說千頭萬緒，捐稅田賦不好開徵，即使機構成熟，請間在這大亂之後民不聊生之際，政府還好意思向人民伸手要錢？復員經費，省政府津貼三個月，每個月一千五百萬元，可是照目前的支出情形而論，縣政府每月至少需要六千萬元，請問又從那兒來？現在我們在信用範圍之內，儘管設法維持下去；假如朝後看一步，眞令人不寒而慄。」</p>
<p>這是一個特點，東台黨政首長幹部，差不多全是蘇北人，他們服務鄕村，在抗戰時打游擊，勝利後做流亡，直到最近復員了，仍是含辛苦幹。專員公署入東台境不到三天，便搬家一次，然而搬來搬去，仍舊是很湫溢黑暗的一所古老房子。張專員笑對記者說：「我們到現在還正過着游擊生活！」</p>
<p>東臺收復了！人民沒有一個不是喁喁望治。「饑者易爲食，渴者易爲飲。」記者相信在這一羣苦幹的主管當局領導之下，東台很容易恢復其舊觀的！</p>

<h3>「奸匪」與「八大爺」　平漢北段前綫一瞥</h3>
<p>— 本報駐平記者宋紹柏</p>
<p>四日航訊</p>
<p>現在政府與共黨武力都不能完全把握的錯綜地區，你便能督到鬥爭的尖銳到如何程度了。這些地區，所看見的只有生死存亡的鬥爭。老百姓就在這種鬥爭中一羣羣的死亡了。因爲共產黨的施策，「階級鬥爭」可以在這裏淸晣的看出來。呌共產黨作「奸匪」的人們，都是被共黨將其財產「鬥爭」「淸算」光了，這些人在最後只好離開他的家，全家遷到政府控制的城市或車站去，他們就是化富有爲接受振濟的成千成萬的「難民」，但是振濟只能解決生存問題於一時，所以最後便又結成了所謂「武裝還鄕隊」，或去參加警團工作，一邊可以賺錢，一邊可以執槍回鄉尋找他們的仇家——共黨壯級幹部」復仇，只要見到，捉回去的很少，大多是就地結果了仇家的性命，（或是自己被仇家結果）他們恐怕帶回縣去，那仇家繳幸不致死。人打死以後，裝去那仇家的所有食物，放火燒去仇家和自家的房屋，重回縣城去準備再來。保甲長有權逮捕任何可疑的人，和平的鄕村，如今已化做仇殺塲。以前死一個人要傳遍數十里鄕里的農村，現在被殺已經是家常便飯而不足爲奇了！他方共產黨也有其羣衆，根據涿縣黨部電記者爾佩蓀的話，那些「窮光旦」是呼八路軍爲「八大爺」的，八路軍到了不常到的村荘時，窮人聽見來時便很快的跑出街口迎接他們：「八大爺，這次該讓我們過過年了吧？接着在八路軍的主持下，較富有人家的糧食被分光了，說個不字，便馬上成問題，有的就因此完結了性命。但是八路軍不能永遠駐在那裏，八路軍走後接着來的是另一種報復鬥爭。蕭書記長說：「今天我們有切實實行民生主義的必要了，口惠可用於一時，第二次便不生效力，僅憑武力鎭壓不能解決問題。」地方的黨政工作者是在希望着政府有通盤的辦法來解決，至少蘇北，冀東，察哈爾的新施策，是有通盤考慮的必要，關於共黨的施策，據在涿縣的一位天主敎神父說，勝利後已較前積極，所以農村的對立與仇殺也較前厲害得多，農村的傳統習慣風尙，正在變化，老百姓普遍的懂得了生活鬥爭。</p>
<p>政治配合不上軍事</p>
<p>在共黨積極活動下，地方政治的脆弱，是値得認眞考慮的問題。此次指揮作戰的人，都慨嘆着政治配合不上軍事，大軍過後的善後工作大多是攪的一團糟，地方武力沒有正規軍配合，就不能把握得牢，更談不到開展。根據河北省第六行政區專員崔世昌與涿縣縣長牛秉樞的說法，是因爲地方工作人員的待遇太低了，因此有能力的人不下鄕亦不敢下鄉，而在中央法令限制之下，一切周轉都受着限制。以縣級待遇講，本年四月份起，省方規定每人生活補助費二萬四千五百元，底薪加成七十七倍，警察公役生活補助費一萬四千七百元，而底餉不過三四十元，就其全部收入說，以每月底薪百元的職員，所得亦僅三萬二千三百元，警役則僅一萬四千七百元，一個人吃組糧尙且不够，養家更談不到了。七月份起，雀方規定提高公敎人員待遇，配發公糧，每人小麥八十市斤，底薪加成一百六十倍，警役小麥六十市斤，加底　，而將生活補助費取消，不准再任意攤派，結果算起帳來，不但未加反而减少了一萬餘元。流亡異縣的縣警隊就更苦了，每人每月不到八九千元，不讓他自已想辦法，不能生活，讓他算辦法，那結果就只有老百姓倒霉了。流弊所及，不堪言狀。反之，共黨的縣村級幹部，他們不但有個人生活保障，一家都可不顧慮生活。在普遍的「鬥爭」「淸算」「翻身運動」下，窮人成了有地有勢的新階級，這些人消極的减少了共黨行政的顧慮，積極的倒是成了共黨的先鋒。根據蕭佩蓀的話，他還沒有遇到一個眞正共產黨員被擄後肯於投降的。而政府的地方行政人員與團警，他們自顧尙且不暇又怎好責他們不盡守土之責。所以今日的第六行政區所轄涿縣，定興，淶水，新城，固安，永淸。霜縣，新錄，萊陽，易縣十縣中，倒有後面所列的六縣在共黨手中，其餘四縣政府所得控制者亦不過其全境中十分之三四而已。經過歷年與此次共軍攻陷後的，各地大遭破壞，地方實在沒有餘力重新建設，再破壞下去，也只有同關於盡了，但是「面子」事仍舊不能不做，如涿縣的爲蔣主席獻校祝壽運動使是將原有的縣立中心小校牌子摘去而換上「涿縣縣立中正小學」的新牌子耳。</p>
<p>前綫的將領　並沒有忘記和平</p>
<p>但是記者從前方歸來後，仔細想想和平仍舊是有望的，那些指揮作戰的將領們，時時在　心着南京的和談消息，站在最前綫的將領們每天用電話向後方打聽當天報紙的消息時，最光的是「南京的談判怎樣？」「是不是還要打下去？」那些靑年軍官們，雅不欲談內戰，可是一談起桂林會戰如何如何，他們會非常興奮而不厭其詳的吿訴你每一次作戰的情形。但是他們痛恨共軍的破壞行爲，認爲這只能消滅國家的元氣。</p>
<p>共軍在北獄廟施放毒氣（特派員杭舟寄）</p>
<h3>熱河心臓　赤峯鳥瞰</h3>
<p>— 本報東北特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>十月卅日瀋陽航訊</p>
<p>富有政治性的熱河首府承德，早已正式接收，形成熱河心臟的赤峯，又於雙十節進人了國軍的懷抱，於是熱河走上了正常軌道。記者爲了看看赤峯的實際情形，好作忠實的報道，在十月廿九日那天早晨，特地隨着去熱河視察的社聿明將軍，跑到了飛機塲。</p>
<p>一架雙引擎運輸機，午前十點鐘，離開了北陵機塲，首先朝向西南飛，掠過了錦州天空，又折向西北飛，朝陽，建平，過了老哈河，駛進了赤峯盆地。</p>
<p>赤峯是熱河的心臟，市街的範圍和人口，超過了它的首府承德，民國廿年修築的「葉峯」路，就是從葉柏壽起，到了這裏做終點的，可惜的是這條長的一百四十七公里的鐵路，完全被共軍拆毀了。目前還可以把鐵軌凑攏起來，不過枕木被共軍作工事和當柴燒，有些散失在民間，現在幾乎精光了。</p>
<p>飛機駛經朝陽和建平之間的時候，荒山的背面，都舖着一層薄雪，耀眼，刺激，赤峯寒冷的記憶。在這裏又充分的反應出來，可是進入赤峯盆地時，所感到的是和暖的陽光，並不差於瀋陽，不過，聽說前些日子，赤峯曾下過一塲雪，氣溫一度降到零下四度。</p>
<p>紅山綿延　赤峯由此而得名</p>
<p>俯瞰盆地，隴畝縱橫，赤峯城市，位於盆地的中央飛機逐漸向下落，接着觸進眼簾的是赤褐色矗立着的紅山，紅山脚下，蠕動着成羣的羊羣，田野間有不少收拾禾稼秧桿的男女，在公路和小道上，活動着馱運糧米進城求售的鄕人。赤峯街市的東，北，西，三方面流着幾條小河，山水環抱，可以說是荒山羣裏的另一洞天。</p>
<p>紅山在赤峯市街的東南，「赤峯」就是從此而得名，蒙人呌它爲「烏蘭哈達」，意思就是「紅山」。「赤峯」無城，現在正由駐在該地的九十三軍兄弟們，和老百姓聯合起來，起了周圍的計二十四里的土圍牆。圍牆的要地，都疊有石塊碉堡，以防範意外的滋擾。</p>
<p>共軍撤退　禁運物資到赤峯</p>
<p>飛機降落在城南三四里外的老飛機塲，這裏已經停止駛用了。駕駛員用熟練的技術，平安降落，因爲事前沒有去電報，盧軍長濬泉，臨時驅車往迎。行經街頭，人們知道杜長官到了，都在臉上顯示着誠摯的敬意。</p>
<p>街頭巷尾，整然有序，人們的衣着，也極樸素整齊。很少極端襤褸和面露菜色的人們。商家鋪戶，幾乎都開門應市，不過物價上漲不已，據說原因有二：一爲錦州一帶商人，到達極快，大批購買；其次是共軍退到烏丹北部以後，即限制他們控制區域裏的物資，運到赤峯來。</p>
<p>整理戶籍由惶惑趨向安定</p>
<p>赤峯縣長孫明，因爲他到任比軍隊晚了好多日子，關於縣裏一切，剛剛開始辦理，一切工作正待積極開展。赤峯的人民，已由惶惑走向安定的正軌，現在正推動已收復各鄉區戶口的整理工作</p>
<p>全縣的戶口，根據去年的統計數字，是三十二萬六千三百一十九人。赤峯街市人口數目，據最近的調查，是劃分六十五保，五百六十六甲，九千六百七十八戶，四萬三千八百九十四人，內男性二萬三千一百六十四人，女性二萬零七百三十人。</p>
<p>學校開學了，赤峯中學有學生二百一十二人，小學十所，有學生一千四百八十人，另外有國民小學一所，九十三軍政治部，在發動各級學校復課，曾盡了好多力量。本月十二日，各校在該部號召下，就完全復課了。</p>
<p>國軍進駐纔知道誰是領袖</p>
<p>牆頭上到處寫着：一蔣主席萬歲」「擁護杜長官安定新熱河」之類的標語。據該軍政治部負責人說：「赤峯民衆在過去敵僞蹂躪之下，極感痛苦，共軍在赤峯又住了一年多，他們只知除共產黨外，尙有國民黨，却並不知道國民黨領袖爲誰。在本軍進駐後，對於國軍威儀，頗多讚許，同時也知道了國父和蔣主席」。</p>
<p>孫縣長說：「當着國軍進駐之初，一般人民有的不敢出頭，或者有些存着騎牆的心理，原因是共軍還在四郊，生恐他們再進來找他們算賬。後來共軍漸漸遠了，最近的地方，也在六十里以外，同時，經我將政府對待國民的方針宣佈，主要的是今後人人可得自由，從前被迫參加八路軍要自新的，政府寬大爲懷，不究旣往，共軍濟伏下來的人們，希望能覺悟，絕對不容許他們擾亂治安，此時人民才安定下來，並表示心悅誠服」。</p>
<p>「還有一樁使大家感覺不安的，那是從前被共軍淸算過的人們，現在要實行反淸算。縣府吿訴他們，共軍把所有的物資運走了，貧富之間再沒有什麼可爭的道理，希望大家精誠合作，共同恢復秩序，因爲不這樣，地方治安不能迅速的寗靜下來」。</p>
<p>蒙回同胞　人口佔十分之一</p>
<p>蒙胞和回胞，在熱河人口總數裏，佔着一部份，蒙胞在這裏更有悠久的活動歷史。據估計在赤峯的蒙胞，僅佔赤峯城全人口百分之十强，過去王府人員，現在多在葉柏壽，赤峯設有「翁牛特右旗辦事處」。</p>
<p>據僞滿年鑑記載：省北部漢蒙雜居，由於兩民族的傳統和思想性格的不同，或以土地權利和貢納關係爲中心，所引起的經濟上的利害衝突，頗難使其融洽統合，因是在漢蒙同一地區裏，不得不施行，以蒙人爲對象的旗制，惟於「康德」六年九月蒙古王公，自動放棄其固有之特權，於是多年阻碍推行省政的縣旗二元行政綜合一元化了。</p>
<p>聽說在這裏的蒙胞，現在又打算來一套什麽自己的組織，這未免又要蹈過去縣旗制度的　雜了；回胞在這裏的佔全城人口百分之二十强，多爲牛羊肉小販，或經營小飯館生涯，聞過去因爲文化落後，易受人挑撥，時有與漢胞摩擦處，今後政治能上軌道，當然，一切問題，便都可以獲得解決。</p>
<p>機件帶走　恢復發電尚有待許多邊區之地，民性多强悍。又因這裏是一個產烟區域，所以吸毒者殊多。</p>
<p>赤峯的出口物產有毛皮，牲畜，小麥和高粱，多運往錦州和瀋陽等地，一般日用品的價格低於瀋陽，猪肉流通券每斤六十元，牛肉每斤五十元，羊肉每斤五十五元，白麵每斤五十元，喬面每斤二十五元，高梁米每斤十六元，小米每斤十五元，雞蛋每斤十元，斐利浦香烟一百三十元一小盒。</p>
<p>有的火力發電廠，供給七千多燈戶。共軍在走的時候，把小機械和零星機件帶走了，以至於現在還不能恢復發電，電訊局也遭遇着同一的運命，因而造成了赤峯的漆黑而呆滯現象。</p>
<p>輕裝簡從　杜將軍堅毅和靄</p>
<p>杜聿明將軍，在赤峰躭擱了三個多鐘頭，除了聽取軍事的報吿和加以指示外，對於縣政和黨政機關負責人，對於蒙回同胞，股殷以合力建設新赤峰相勗勵。</p>
<p>午後三時廿分，記者馳赴西郊九里的大飛機塲。幾聲號角，螺旋漿發動，飛機迅速昇起，向赤峰吿別。歸途，另取經過阜新上空的直飛航綫，四時五十分就回到了瀋陽。</p>
<p>杜將軍輕裝簡從，僅帶副官一人，其餘是六個新聞記者。杜將軍堅毅機警，和靄可親，這是我們這一批記者共同的印象。</p>

<h3>初冬話陜棉</h3>
<p>— 本報駐西安記者李馳</p>
<p>四日西安航訊</p>
<p>在江南常常遇到「一雨便成秋」的氣象，到了西北，就變爲「一雨便成冬」了！記得全國今冬的降雪綫在上月超過迪化蘭州那天，長安下了一塲冷雨，氣溫從此明顯下降，旬日前降雪綫再跨過滯陽而「入關」，長安也下了一塲冷雨，城裏人開始被起棉襖皮袍子。當日裏城南的鄉農說：終南山（秦嶺的餘脈之一，其北麓即長安）已經戴上雪雪白帽子了！</p>
<p>提起冷和雪，我們自然想到白如雪的棉花。而棉花在陝西的重要性，說起來怕要超過好些人想像以上。不久以前，中美農業合作團到陜西來考察，此間有關方面就提供了如下足以驕人的數字：「民國三十年起，政府開始全國棉田征實（按即用棉花實物來完納田賦），實際上主要的就是靠陜西。民國三十四年全國賦棉總額，陜西佔了百分之百。……」雖說我們對不起抗戰巾吃不飽穿不暖的士兵也吧，但是陜西人確確實實可以毫無愧色的說：弟兄們身上穿的棉紗棉布，除了軍需處用錢買的以外，都是陜西棉農不收一文而獻給政府的，即使政府買進的軍棉，陜棉也佔了裏量上的第一位！</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，華北華中的產棉區已次第收復，然而，陜棉的重要性仍未减低，據今年的全國棉產預測，總收穫量的爲五百萬市担（即五〇公斤，以下同）其中屬於陝西的佔九分之一即五十五萬市祖，以省別而言，陜西僅次於湖北，河北，江蘇而佔了第四位，不過鄭，冀，蘇三省年內因有戰爭關係，事實上是否達到預期的數字，不無疑問。</p>
<p>筆者另從書本上找到了世界棉產量的統計數字，計自一九三五年至三九年間，平均每年產量爲七〇億公斤，其中美棉之三〇億公斤幾乎佔了一半，而中國全國的六億公斤約爲全數十一分之一。陜棉在其時佔了多少比重呢？據東省記錄：陝棉自一九三四年至四〇年這七年間，其平均每年產量爲五千二百五十萬公斤，（注意：這七年也就是陝棉自有記錄以來二十五年間之「黃金時代」！）的合半億公斤而稍多一點。換言之，在上述時期內，僅僅以陝西一省（更精確一點說，僅僅是關中「涇渭之間」的一帶棉田）的產棉，就佔了全國產棉額的十一分之一，全世界產棉額的一百三十分之一！</p>
<p>從以上舉列出兩項數字中，細心的讀者必定看出陜棉在六年以至十二年以前之間的每年平均產量，要超出今年產量的一倍。是的，自從民廿九年因棉賤麥米貴，許多農田都改種食糧以後，陜棉產量就開始說减，最少的一年即民三十一年所收穫的一千五百萬公斤棉花，僅抵陜棉「黃金時代」的三分之一，幸而最近逍四年來年有增加，而今年的收穫量，又比去年的二千五百萬公斤再增加了幾乎十分之一。</p>
<p>綜觀十餘年來的陝西棉業史的紀錄，當知當地棉價之漲或賤，無時不刺激增加或抑减棉田總面積與棉花總產量。根據十年來西安市棉花與麥子之間的售價比率記錄，棉最貴的是在民廿九年夏秋季，當時每斤棉可換七斤多小麥，而這年也就是棉農「黃金時代」的最後一年。往後棉價總趕不上糧價，而棉產額跟着從三十年而銳减了。棉最賤的是民三十年的冬季，一斤棉換不到三斤麥子，去年八月初日本投降的前夕，甚至低到僅可換成兩斤麥，而今年九月底，棉價再跌了四分之三！後來物價由穩定而再度上漲，棉雖然並不例外，但是那利潤却收歸囤棉商的腰包，因爲大多數棉農，早已在秋末冬初被迫的不管貴賤賣與棉商。今年棉價比去年好得多了，現在的市况大的一斤棉可換四斤半麥子，而且今年棉田的田賦，是徵糧而不徵棉，棉農總可以歇一口氣了。（以上售價均按批發値計）</p>
<p>其後，讓我們談到陜棉的「質」。棉的「質」在農學上雖然包括許多項目，不過從應用上（紡織上）主要的僅是看棉的纖維長度。因爲太短的棉花纖維祗能紡成十支到十六支的粗紗，拉力不够，僅可織成粗布。陝棉在抗戰中的主要用途是紡成軍衣用的十六支紗粗，故此間的紗廠大多數亦以十六支紗爲中心。抗戰勝利後，滬布洋布源源西運入陝，陝省紡織業開始用陝棉大量地紡成二十支紗。若想再細一點，則問題並不在於陜棉的品質，而在陝省紗廠的設備和技術。據聞上海的國營和私營紗廠曾用陝棉作爲試騐材料，其結果最大限度可紡成三十二支細紗，換言之，足以織成日常通用的細布而有餘了。</p>
<p>在今天，陜棉無論從質從量看來，顯然尙有「百尺竿頭進一步」的發展餘地，然而它目前的成就，却非一朝一夕僥倖獲致。這例子或者正好供給農業專家作爲參考。</p>
<p>先從產棉地區的限制條件而說。如所周知：陜西是個東西狹而南北長的省份，從自然地理上來看，它可以劃分爲陜北，關中，陜南這三區。前者屬黃土高原，水分缺乏，理想的倒不如發展成爲畜牧區，惟有後二者即渭河和漢水兩盆地，才充分旦備耕作條件。根據陜棉之權）威硏究者李國楨氏結論：「不祗緯度限制了產棉區的地域境界，而且高度，地勢，雨量，氣溫……等等，無一不是同樣重要的因子」。由此可知：陜省產棉區今日之集中關中，與乎比較河北省正定等縣產棉區緯度更南的陜北之不適於種棉，自有原因。目下陜省棉田面積之在關中的，的佔百分之九十，陝南百分之八，而陝北僅百分之二而已。關中一區，若詳細的再劃分，尙可分爲沿黃河區，省東區，「涇惠渠」受益區，省會附近區，及其他等五區。「涇渭之間」在今天正是一片主要的產棉區。</p>
<p>很明顯的：陝棉在太省農業改進所（李國楨氏任所長）多年督導之下，品質和每畝產量已有驚人的進步。更精確說來，我仍還得倒溯到民十三年省立棉業試騐塲之首先着手改良，和二十三年起農業改進所着重於改善陜棉的品種，這樣經過二十二年如一日的不斷努力，才有今天的成就，「羅馬不是一天建立起來的」！</p>
<p>目下本省推廣得成績最好的是「斯字四號」和「德字」棉，兩者都屬美國種，尤以「斯字四號」成績最佳，棉織維長度達廿九公厘，最高的收獲紀錄。曾超過普通陝種百分之六八，八，從此可知改良種子是怎麽重要的一項工作。「斯字」棉「落藉」陜西，也有十年以上的歷史了，關中一帶棉農對它很信賴，不過老鄕們農業知識到底落後，如何保持純種及共優良性，正是「陜省棉產品質改進座談會」中一樁重要課題。</p>
<p>有關方面正在計劃棉產的品抓分級，他似想通過各地農會一類組織，在棉花大量推出市塲之前，先行評定其等級，一如上海之檢定生絲。實施這計劃起初必將遭遇到困難，然而受惠的將來依然是在棉農，因爲棉花經過科學化的檢定，他就明白自己的產品比起別人別地屬較好抑或較劣，因而努力改進。以期產品「升級」。而更大的意義，則在保證每一級的品質高下，使購買者放心採用，日久自然增加顧主的信心</p>
<p>今年的五十五萬市担新花，曾有人憂心它的出路，因爲軍棉不再大量需要了，政府也不徵實了。但現在看來，這不過是「杞人憂天」，僅以「中紡」這一個大戶頭而論，已經着手在陜收購二十萬市担以上，其他的和當地的紡織廠亦已紛紛採購新花。銷路和價格都不成問題，問題祗在交通能否更爲暢通，希望不要把過大的運費加在廉價的陝棉（目下凈棉每市斤批發價爲一千一二百元左右）身上，因而抵抗不住佔了輸入額第一位的美棉，印棉，和巴西棉的傾銷。</p>
<p>陜棉景况好，陜西的農村經濟當然也跟着好。甚至也可這樣說，陜棉賣得好，上海棉布運進來的銷路也必跟着好，因爲農村的購買力增加了。陝棉不過到上海「旅行」一次，然而這樣打一個圈子，陜西老鄉農和上海紗廠女工同受其惠。</p>

<h3>憲政問題的爭論</h3>
<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>金良本著　青年出版社</p>
<p>中華民國已成立了三十五年，　　有全國奉行的完善憲政，弄得國本動搖戰禍頻仍，誰都曉得這是一件大憾事。全國渴望的國民大會，却因事實與環境底關係，延了五次期，前幾天纔由政府明令確定於本年十一月十二日召集。現在又展期三天以候各黨各派提出代表名單。吵鬧了數十年的中國憲政問題，或者從此可以解決，以慰全國喁喁之望。金良本先生這本書，是站在客觀的立塲，對於批評「五五憲草」的各派理論，作一個精密而很公允的答復。在思想混亂，是非不明的今日，頗値得一讀；尤其是負有制憲責任的國大代表，更常人手一册。</p>
<p>這　共五章，第一章緒論，第一節叙述憲政問題底提出。第二節請憲法底槪念，分憲法形式與憲法實質兩部討論。第三節講憲法與民主政治底關係。</p>
<p>至於第二章谷黨派戰時實施憲政底論爭與批判，我們認爲事過境遷，毋庸詞費。第四章中國國民黨對憲政問題底態度。第一節講國民黨在理論上對於憲政底主張，援引中山先生遺敎，把國民黨對於民權底主張，對於憲政底主張，對於實施憲政底主張，以及它所持訓政的精神，都很剴切地硏討了一下。第二節講國民黨在歷史上對於憲政底鬥爭。也不必多說，議論最精彩的，要算第三軍「五五憲草底論爭與批判」。可惜限於篇幅不能多多介紹，只好稍微摘錄，讀者於此，也可略窺一斑了。</p>
<p>第三章第一節討論民族自決原則問題。贊成憲草原案「中華民國各民族均爲中華國族。構成分子，一律平等。」向援引蘇聯例子，提出「民族自決三原則」底人們，反復辨明三民主義的憲法與蘇維挨社會主義的憲法不同之點。所以民族自決是有其條件的，第一，應該是建築在互助的條件上的。……第二，應以不妨害國家統一爲其最高準則。……不過蘇聯憲法第三十條底規定足使若干少數民族和其他民族，一樣在中央取得平等發言地位，……這種用意是値得我們參考的。</p>
<p>第二節討論人民底自由權利依法限制問題。它引據輓近學理，反對「人民權利絕對說」，與個人自由主義論」。作者引各國憲法實例，如德國韋瑪憲法，墨西哥憲法，蘇聯憲法，證明五五憲草上，關於人民自由權利之稍加限制，在原則上不足爲病。</p>
<p>國大代表</p>
<p>第三節討論國民大曾與國民代表，及國民議政會問題。它對於（一）國民大會底職權與會期間題，主張本屆大會職權應該遵守民國二十六年修正公佈的國民大會組織法。「原因是憲法由何項機關執行，自應由憲法去規定，如呆以組織法規定制憲的國民大會行使憲法所賦予之權限，便無異以組織法決定憲法所應決定的問題，以組織法限制了憲政機關底權力，預定憲法底內容，而提前付之於制憲機關了。」大會底會期，它贊成孫哲生先生底主張，將國民大會三年門　一次改爲一年一次。（二）國民大會代表問題：它對主張國民大會全部重選底提議，依據法理辨駁之後。論中央指示：「國民大會組織法與國民代表選舉法，現經國民政府依立法手續鄭重頒布，並由國民政府遵照實施，其依選舉法選出之代表，「除附逆有據，應由政府依法辦理外，自應一律有效。」這是非常合理的。但它對於國民大會代表選舉法，却表示非常不滿。說「極端統制，有違選舉制度底原論，……深望政府當局，即時有所補救。」現在照政治協商會議底協議，國大代表名額，已大加擴充，或可稍微補救選舉法之缺點。（三）設置國民議政會問題，這是張　勱等提議的，與何思敬等所提在國民大會閉會期間，組織常委會意思，有點相彷彿，常委會這一類的組織，因爲違背了中山先生五權政治底精神，所以在憲草初稿雖　三讀通過，後來終把它取消了。國民議政會底職　，那更廣大，「不僅總　政權，而且並　治權。」這是違背五權憲法精神的。</p>
<p>總統職權</p>
<p>第四節討論總統職權問題。有的認爲憲草上總統職權底規定未免太大，應于修改。有的認爲總統應統攬治權，即强化行政權。它對這兩說都不贊同。它明確地說：「如果全國過半數省份，沒有達到憲政開始時期，即行召開國民大會，頒布憲法，那末根據這個憲法所召開的國民大會，職權的行使，與全國過半教省份已經達到憲政開始時期，頒布憲法所召開的國民大會職權的行使，不可相提並論。最低限度，後者職權所行使，應該較前者職權的行使底範圍爲廣大，爲徹底。……現在全國過牛數省份沒有達到憲政開始時期，……召開大會，頒布憲法，它底國民大會職權的行使，選舉權不及於行政，司法，考試院副院長；罷免權不及於行政院院長，副院長。換言之，即是讓總統對行政院院長有任免權；對司法，考試院院長，副院長，有任命權，這又有什麼可以値得非議的呢？如果因此而就認爲總統職權規定得太大，更可不必。老實說，現在憲草上關於總統職權底規定，尤其量亦不過祗是採取一種責任總統制而已。所以憲草上這種規定，可說正是符合建國大綱底本意的。」這段議論，如就現實情形而言，不無相當理由，但憲法不比普通法，是比較有永久性，不能隨便更改的。現在雖有過半數省份未達到憲政開始時期，難道就永久不達到憲政開始時期嗎？</p>
<p>中央與地方</p>
<p>本書一切理論，旣完全以中山先生遺敎爲標準，「建國大綱，是國父最後最大的著作；建國大綱第二十四條，明明規定，憲法頒布之後，中央統治權，則歸國民大會行使；即國民大會對於中央政府官員各有選舉權，有罷免權；對於法律，有創制權及複決權，旣云對於中央政府官員，沒有分別；顯見各院院長都包括在內。今憲草把行政院院長底任免權，司法，考試院院長任命權劃歸總統，而不劃　國民大會，這顯然與中山先生手訂的建國大綱相衝突，何必强爲辯護？何獨不主張遵照建國大綱？如認爲有碍責任總統制，五權政治中底總統制，不即是建國大綱底創作嗎？即欲徹底實行責任總統制，我們認爲行政，司法，考試院院長，副院長底任命，至少也應改爲由總統提出國民大會，徵求同意。應不違背五權分立底本旨。至於主張强化行政權，要總統總攬治權的那一說，治權與行政權底區別，都沒有認淸，那簡直不値一辨了。</p>
<p>第五節討論增設「中央與地方政府」一章的問題。它底結論是：「（一）中央與地方底權限，不是採分權制，而是採均權制；允其不應列舉中央權限，以未列舉的留給地方；應該列舉地方權限，以未列舉的留給中央。</p>
<p>第六節國民經濟章和第七節敎育章作者主張保留原案。辯答頗爲精闢。</p>
<p>歸納起來說，這本書可說是「五五憲草」底答辨書，也是三民主義和五權憲法底忠實擁護者。它除承認應該加入中央與地方一章，及補充敎育一章案文外；憲草上所有條文，都認爲母庸修改。其中雖不免有牽强之處，如關於總統職權問題，前面我已經指摘過。又如說「黨治必然是民主的，」語病也很大。但就大體說來，它站在三民主義和五權憲法底立塲來批評各派關於五五憲草底批評，總算是很客觀，很公正的。</p>
<h3>第二次世界大戰畫史</h3>
<p>— 坦蕩</p>
<p>舒宗僑編著　聯合畫報社出版</p>
<p>我看過幾本中文本的，二次大戰史，覺得它的內容和體裁都有問題，材料旣不完全尤其關於中國抗戰部份不是完全把它忽略，便是過於簡略，似乎犯了忽視自已中國八年抗戰十四年苦鬥在二次大戰中所應有的地位。其决是沒有完好的照片和地圖，支配全省大戰期間軍事政治及外交上的演變，愈看愈覺乏味，因而大大降低了閱讀的興趣。體裁方面，立塲編組，不能將各種抗戰力量，平衡處理，我也看過一本美國人編著的大戰史，和一太英國人編著的大戰畫史。前者文字事實够詳細，地圖够豐富，可是一面忽略了中國戰塲的許多戰况，同時也沒有一張戰事照片給我閱讀時一種輕鬆的快感。後者文字地圖和照片都配合得頗完美叙述也够詳細，究竟編著者眞不愧爲白種的盎格魯撤克遜人，用「白眼」來觀察我國在大戰中的地位和把我國英勇抗戰的事績無形中削减了許多。看後令人失望。</p>
<p>一本戰史，要拿穩公正忠實的立塲，而不攙雜一點政治色彩和宣傳口吻去寫，實在不易，因爲我們不易讀到一本眞實而不受驕，不受委曲的戰史。再加上我國物質條件的限制，要寫成一本沒有上面的缺點而又適合國人胃口的畫史，實在不是易事。</p>
<p>舒宗僑編著的第二次世界大戰　史，最近已經出版問世，從內容及體裁去看，雖然難期盡善盡美，可是由於編者十多年來在前綫後方從事新聞工作的經騐和美國新聞處戰時給與聯合畫報的大批資料，這本畫史的出現，可說是開畫史界的先鋒。從照片份量說，積聯合畫報抗戰八年所收集之大量照片，提選若干幅，實堪稱照片中的精華，這不能不算是編者的一大成功，其中彩色圖八幅，爲圖片中別開生面。外間不易見到的照片有重慶大墜道慘案，西西里天空火網，戰後柏林慘景，倫敦，紐約，重慶，莫斯科，上海慶祝勝利，逼眞生動，均頗名貴，再如史達林與松岡洋右掛臂膀，溥儀登極，墨屍倒懸米蘭，更富歷史諷刺意義。</p>
<p>全書四百頁，字數四十萬，其最大特色，中國抗戰部份特詳，約佔全書三份之一，實爲坊間所見中外出版各戰史所罕有。書中對各戰塲會戰役不論大小久暫均叙述無遺，堪稱精細，文巾除以生動照片實證外，復有各戰塲軍事形勢演變詳岡，並附錄國際間及盟方軸心間重大文獻達七十種，再加最近開會中之巴黎和會文獻，因此該書無論爲公民敎材史地常識專題硏究，均極有帮助。而編者對於我國各種抗戰力量，等量齊觀，不偏不倚，其公正寬宏精神，允足爲後來編戰史者的一種啓導。惟希望將來能在印刷和紙張方面加以改進允佳。</p>
<h3>戰後世界殖民地問題</h3>
<p>— 納雅</p>
<p>石嘯沖著「戰後世界殖民地問題」　新中出版社　三十五年八月初版</p>
<p>關於大戰後的世界，强國是人人知道的；而那些殖民地呢，同樣是很重要的。我們對於道個問題應有充分的認識。但是，留意它的人却並不多。</p>
<p>因爲，强國之間的糾紛，常是爲殖民間題所引起，要明瞭國際情勢，首先必需明白殖民地問題，由此進一步而獲得各國之間的關係和情形。</p>
<p>這本「戰後世界殖民地問題」，是講述了現階段的世界殖民地問題。</p>
<p>第一，它把十九世紀，英·法·德三國佔有的殖民的面積和人口，列表說明；更將歐洲列强所佔領的殖民地，作百分比之比較。</p>
<p>由此，述到第一次世界大戰後二十年中，各殖民地的爭取獨立運動，如：印度·朝鮮·越南·埃及·摩洛哥·諸國，書中簡明說出其運動之起迄成果。</p>
<p>接着，就請到第二次世界大戰戰時的世界各殖民地動態；從而再說到戰後的各殖民地動態，及其要求獨立運動的現勢。</p>
<p>在這些題目下，作者應用谷方面的材料來充分說明，讀後就一目瞭然當前的世界殖民地問題。</p>
<p>最後，作者並作對世界殖民地的展望，希望各殖民地早日自由生存。</p>
<p>我不再多贅累，總之在這本書裏吿訴了我們一些新的世界知識。各方人士，均値得一讀！</p>
<h3>和平，和平，多少僞善者假借你的美名。</h3>
<p>二次大戰書史挿圖]</p>
<h3>一個英國人　對中國的印象</h3>
<p>— 蕭夫</p>
<p>一九四六年美國麥美倫公司出版全書二百一十七頁價美金二元七角五分著者：Richard　P·Dobson，該書原名爲China　Cycle，可譯「中國印象」</p>
<p>外國人記載中國的書篇，並不在少，而具有偏見的太多。一般外國人對中國並不瞭解，而且對中國的智識非常有限。一方面我們　盡力宣傳，同時若有外國人記載中國的事情，我們不能忽略。美國的報紙關於中國的消息，少而又少。三兩大不過有一個短短的電訊。地位常常很不顯著。這是留美的同人最感覺燥悶的。</p>
<p>中國印象的作者是一個年輕的英國人，他於一九三六年代表英美烟公司，到中國銷貨，在中國走的地方很多，因而對中國人發生了好感。一九四一年，他加入英國皇家空軍作飛行員。他自己並不以思想家自居，而且並無驚人之筆，但有一個最有價値的地方，就是著名對政治並無興趣，而且具有國家的偏見，但從他並無政治目的當中，發現了而且相信中國是一個偉大的國家，最近雖在水深火熱之中，前途是無限的。</p>
<p>他雖然很喜愛中國，但其種族的偏見難除，比如他反對英德交惡，因爲這有損於西方的團結，而有利於東方。他攻擊葡萄牙對東方的妥協。他對他的德國的朋友亦有贊美，比如忠於國家。但對法國人極爲不滿，認爲美國人浮燥而天眞，對俄國無批評。</p>
<p>德比森君雖然有這些偏見，及一些錯誤，但他的誠懇和他的虛懷，勇於學習，歉意接受旁人的意見，使他的偏見成爲不重要的問題了。他對中國表示深厚的同情，具見其居心熱誠，渥滋（Richard　Watts）批評這本書的時候，無怪乎評說，「讀完這本書，你感覺作者是一個很可親近的朋友，很適於和你一同在中國旅行。」</p>
<p>作者對於重慶備極贊許，不但認爲在地理上有地利之險，而且認爲足以代表中國人的朝氣與活力。不過在人口的數字上，他弄錯了，加了一倍上去。不過這是些小疵，不足重視。</p>
<p>但對中國人的性格以及國家的缺點，作者多能看到，而且不客氣的舉出來。他舉出有貧窮，疾病，貪汚。對於徵兵以及官吏缺乏責任心等等，亦均指出，這些短處並不足以搖撼他對中國人的信心，他認爲中國人有無限的活力和百折不回的精神，中國人具有這些美德，就是造成偉大國家的原料。他認爲中國有最多的人口和最畏的歷史，一且政治上了軌道，中國的前途無限，這是任何力量不能阻止的。而且在道一點，世界上沒有其他民族可以超過中國。</p>
<p>德比森對中國所抱的希望，我們非常感謝。凡是中國人都應該向這條路努力。外國人一批許到中國，永遠提到貪汚，好像貪汚與中國不可分的。有些美軍發的小册子，亦闢有專欄，吿訴新來華的美國兵，中國人每個人都「揩油」。託朋友買東西，他若是一個好人，只取百分之十佣金。這種錯誤的觀念當然是對中國的一種侮辱。不過我國若無大量的貪汚的現象，何致給外國人這種印象。一般說來，外國人對中國都寄有同情和希望，我國一且政治上了軌道，無疑是世界最強大的國家，旅居國外的同胞們，也可大吐一口氣。</p>

<h3>向中央研究院建議設立　特種問題研究所</h3>
<p>— 徐仲年</p>
<p>民國三十五年十月二十日至二十五日，中央硏究院舉行第二屆三次評議會，蔣主席頒給訓詞中，有：「無科學即無國防」一語；同月三十一日，爲蔣主席六旬壽辰，敎育部規定自該日起，至明年十月止，爲「興學祝壽年」：這兩件盛舉，各有千秋，却引起了我的小小感觸。</p>
<p>「無科學即無國防」，這是天經地義，毫無疑問的事實。然而中國提倡科學，已有年所；我們不否認中國的科學有相當的進步却也不得不承認中國的科學進步得太慢，萬萬不能和先進的國家相比！在今天，我們幾乎可以說：中國賴籍了人家的科學，纔有國防：這是極不正常，萬分危險的現象！這種現象的養成，固然由於惡劣的學術環境，——目下中國的智識份子而臨「學術」和「饑寒」的交界綫，生存尙且發生問題，寗論學術？——却也因爲缺乏科學精神。</p>
<p>什麽是科學精神？笛卡德的「方法論」：（一）在沒有切實地認識某事物時，不要接受它以爲是眞的；（二）把我需要審察的諸難點分作若十（愈多愈好）宜於解決的部份；（三）在我的思想中，從最容易，最簡單的事物按序審察；（四）全部調査，全部複觀，直到我獲得絕無遺漏的確證爲止。這個方法自然是科學方法，它的依據和發揚乃是科學精神。再簡括些說，所謂科學精神者，就是古老的「知之爲知之，不知爲不知：斯知也。」</p>
<p>中國科學的進步遲緩還害在頭巾氣。老式的士大夫有老式的頭巾氣：「中學爲體，西學爲用：中國的文化不容輕視！」新式的士大夫有新式的頭巾氣：「中國根本就沒有科學。什麼是中國的科學？是迷信，是奶奶經而已！」二者都失之「偏」，都不合枓學，都是愚蠢·幼稚·可笑！他們犯了一種通病：「一得自封，恥於下問！」</p>
<p>殊不知在這些「迷信」，這些「奶奶經」裏，頗有値得我們硏究的問題。我們應當大量吸收外來的科學，同時可以從這些「迷信」，這些「奶奶經」裘提取精華，和道地的科學配合起來，開闢新的途徑。博士·碩士·學士之流往往看不起這些「迷信」·這些「奶奶經」，不必說硏究，連問都不屑問！結果呢？「一物不知，儒者之恥」：只見他們不「博」，不「碩」，不「學」不「士」而已！下面我舉幾個例，證明「迷信」或「奶奶經」不是純粹沒有研究價値的。</p>
<p>第一個例：趕屍。在西南多山的省份裏，有一種奇特的運屍方法，呌做「趕屍」。中國人的家鄕觀念是非常之濃的：「樹高千丈，葉落歸根」，客死者的靈柩務必運回家鄉下葬但是，萬一逢到了崇山峻嶺，活人都難走，何况運棺？怎麽辦？於是有術人來兜生意：他們兩人一組，穿了半紅牛綠的衣裳，掮着水火棍，一人打頭，一人押後，中間夾着五七個蒙臉死屍，兩人口中唸咒，屍首便乖乖地魚貫而走，不作怪，也不腐爛，直走到各屍的家裏纔橫倒成殮。您說：『這是神話！』恰巧這是兩個「目覩」這事的科學博士吿訴我的，他們決不撒謊，也沒有撒謊的需要。</p>
<p>第二個例：辰州符。民國廿六年秋，我初到重慶。那時的上淸寺，相當荒凉，祇有平屋。某日，我走過某家，只見門口貼有黃紙大招貼，上書「辰州符」三字；門敞開着，廳中間有）個黃紙剪成的人，跪着一膝，手托一隻盛滿水的琺瑯臉盆。我走了過去，又走了渦來。廳上坐的人就笑向我道：「不相信麼？」我也笑着回答：「不火相信！我可以試試麼？」「可以的！」我捻捻紙人，果然是紙，內面並無鋼絲之類；我叩叩臉盆，則淸脆有聲；我伸兩指人水，拔指時，淋漓盡緻，果眞是水！結果，我莫明其妙！</p>
<p>第三個例：奮門遁甲。這是今年七月裏我在漢口看到的。一個算命先生，不坐而立，也無桌子，就人行道上放下一方油布，布上繪有「八卦」和「太極圖」，「太極圖」的中心安置一個小黃紙包。走過一位中級公務人員，看了一眼，便立停了，請先生算命。先生遞給他一方白紙（注意顏色），一隻鉛筆，道：『你不要開口！但把你的年齡八字，家巾人口，所問何事，一一寫明，將紙摺起，不可吿訴我。我再把這個小黃紙封拆給你看：如果兩紙所寫相同，那是靈了，你就問下去；如果不同，那就不　，你請你的便，半文錢都不要花！」接着寫者自寫，算命者自　符。開視結果，黃白兩紙所寫相同！您說：『兩人串通作弊！』可能的，但是，靈，只會靈一次；如若第二次不靈，分文不收，他豈非要餓肚皮？</p>
<p>等類的怪事還多着咧！我儘可學時髦，輕描淡寫說：『這是迷信！』但是我的良心爲之不安：因爲這不是「迷」或不「迷」的問題，而是道道地地的「不懂」！旣然不懂，先不該亂下斷語；而應當澈底硏究，以求「懂」：這纔是科學精神。</p>
<p>可是，一方面，澈底硏究，費時費錢必多；另一方面，這種魔術傳子不傳女，無非爲了保存秘密，保存飯碗，如果我們想學習，必須先行解決老師的生活問題；第三方面，這類研究牽涉必廣，物理，化學，生物，植物，民俗，社會，歷史，地理，宗敎等學都有密切的關係：所以一個人的精力財力都不够，必須有鉅大的學術團體爲後盾。</p>
<p>或許有人以爲這些是不急之務。對不起，我想嗤之以鼻！五十年前，倘若有位先知先覺向我們描寫五十年後的火箭，飛彈，雷達，電目，原子彈，宇宙錢，我們要不要笑他痴人說夢呢？何况所硏究的對象並不限於上述的三個例？主持這些硏究的人不必自身是科學家，——他決不會是萬能博士，——但必須有廣博的常識，熱烈的求知慾，尤其要有十足的科學精神，以及眞正的科學家爲助手</p>
<p>我向中央硏究院建議設立「特種問題硏究所」。</p>

<h3>山城小品</h3>
<p>— 蘇旦</p>
<p>紫羅蘭</p>
<p>當太陽還隱在濃霧後面的時候，農塲底十字小路都是潤濕的，好似昨夜曾落過一陣暴雨。葡萄架不住滴着水珠，這邊和那邊，都聽得見水珠掉在枯葉上的輕微聲音。購弱無力的菊花，垂着蓬鬆的頭，有的竟相互交頸攤在地上。橘樹和羅漢松，它們滿身的葉子在霧裏沐浴着，更加翠綠了，那矮胖的龍舌蘭，豪恣地張開有刺的葉子承受着霧，眞像　預的武夫，在夏夜裏袒開毛刺刺的胸膛納凉一樣。</p>
<p>霧，到處都是霧。沉甸甸的……</p>
<p>苗圃中，紫羅蘭還祇兩寸多高。前個禮拜日來看它，細弱莖子撑着幾片半舒展的嫩葉。現在也還是這樣。它好像已在這初冬的天氣裏凍怕了，不敢再往上長。但是老園丁說過，總期望它能在春天裏開紫色的花，現在正是樹木落盡它們底葉子的時節，（桃樹，白楊，梧桐都剩着光光的枝條了。）夜裏時有寒風冷雨相逼而來，霜不是已經帶着嚴厲的面貌出現過好幾决麼？前幾天，天空陰沉沉的，彷彿將有大雪降下。雖然人們說這里暖和，雪也許不會落的，風也不會像塞外那末凜冽的。但是誰眞能預測現在的天氣呢？</p>
<p>今早有霧。待一會霧會散的。它散後，就把溫暖的陽光讓過來了。那末，向紫羅蘭道日安喲。</p>
<p>貓</p>
<p>午夜，我幾次被狡猾的耗子吵醒的時候，我總是想起了貓。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，發見我心愛的書嚙破好幾處，桌上的墨水瓶拌倒，我更想貓。</p>
<p>可是，我幷不喜歡貓呵。</p>
<p>我曾寫信吿訴遠方的姊姊說：我現在住的房間裏，需要餵一頭貓。但是我底事情很多，無暇照顧一頭貓，而且我也不愛貓。我還吿訴她，在我小的時候，有一個冬天晚上，偶爾醒來，忽然覺得耳邊發出咕咕的聲音，我嚇得大呌，把頭沒在被裏，祇管喊媽。原來那就是我們鄰家里底花貓蹲在我頭邊，我不知道牠底靠近我是取暖還是想抓我。還是……我罵過牠：「你不能完全不讓我曉得。」又有一天中午，我坐在院子裏的矮凳上專心地玩着畫片，幾隻麻雀在我跟前跳着啄食吃，我完全沒有注意到牠們和身邊的一切。突然一頭貓從我背後躍出捕捉了其中一隻跑了。我驚嚇得忙丟了所有的畫片，哭着跑進屋。我想起牠原來很早就偸偸驟在我後面的。自此，我害怕貓底脚步太輕悄。——雖然幷未抓我——一種害怕的怔忡一直盤踞在我底心裏，貫穿我底兒時。我不明白這種兒時的害怕情緒經過悠久的歲月爲什麽還未從心上褪下去，就像我兒時在額上戳破的一個小痕印，現在依然留在我底額上一樣。</p>
<p>「那末你讓老鼠趕你搬家吧。」</p>
<p>姊姊回信這末逗趣地說。</p>
<p>我是不能搬家的。我也不喜歡貓，但我在另想一個法子去降服房裏。狡猾的耗子。</p>
<h3>還鄉散記</h3>
<p>— 叔孫如瑩</p>
<p>運河</p>
<p>這兒便是遝河了，它並不闊，也沒有起伏的巨浪，它只是徐徐地流着，靜靜地流着，漾漾地流着。從我很幼小時起始，它便是這樣的；如今，我和它分別了十年，它依舊是這樣。離開它時，我還是一個小孩子，再見它時，我已經踏上壯年的路了。運河是永遠不變的，而我却不能永臻靑啊！</p>
<p>現在是秋天，生長在河堤上的柳樹已快凋零了。那枯黃的葉簇被西風吹落下來，飄浮在寂寞的河上。野草也顯得很萎瘦，絕望地仰視着一高曠的天空。我的脚下是褐色的泥士，踏在它上面，我就知道這兒是我的故鄉。我向這褐色的泥土上搜尋我年幼時失落的夢幻，但我連年幼時的腳跡也尋不到了。</p>
<p>運河的子民是永遠浸沉在苦痛的深淵里的。我至今還感覺得到那十多年前的洪水給我的驚悸，如今，運河的子民又從另一個人爲的災難里掙扎過來了，運河里流着的水該不再是水，面是子民們的眼淚了吧？</p>
<p>我是出生於運河上的，我也是運河的子民。而我是不曾把眼淚流在河里的，我以不幸的流浪的生活換取了這更不幸的悲慘的命運。如今，我回到運河畔來了，對着這我們的母親的運河，我眞不能抑止我的憂傷啊！</p>
<p>家園</p>
<p>我踏進我久別的家園，像踏進一個陌生的地方。一堵牆阻塞了我幼時出入的門戶，另一個開在旁邊的門代替了它。我摸索着而折的路徑，走向我誕生的房舍。</p>
<p>我便是誕生在這里的，而且我曾在這兒度過一生中最歡樂的十餘年的時光。這天花板，這窗　，都該記得我幼年時的故事。但這兒的一切對於我竟然都彷彿陌生了，房子也似乎變矮了，變黑了，當天井里還飄浮着蒼茫的黃昏時，室內已必須點上油燈了。</p>
<p>都變了，家園，與自己。但自己的變動，比起家園來得更大些，出於家園的改變和自己的成長，在家園與自已之間，更添上了一重膈膜。當我在外流浪時，千山萬水是我與家園的阻隔，當我回到家里時，自己的一逝不返的歲月却阻隔了我與我的家園。</p>
<p>慢慢地，我終於尋到了我記憶里的家園，我開始對這久別了的家園感到了熟悉。我看見了我幼年時攀登過的杏樹，看見了我幼年時在牆壁上畫的投箭的靶環。我彷彿又回到了我的幼年，彷彿又與那些至今還不能回鄉的弟兄們在一起遊玩了。至今我才了解那黃金的幼年時代的意義，但這已太遲，我再也不能在那黃金時代里逗留一步了。</p>
<p>曠場</p>
<p>這兒會是我讀過六年書的校址嗎？這兒沒有一間房舍，沒有一堵牆，甚至沒有一塊石頭，沒有一顆樹。這兒只是一片曠塲，一片長着衰草的曠塲啊！</p>
<p>我走在這曠塲上，心里翻出了多少記憶。那古老的校舍，那成排的冬靑樹，那守門的胖子老詹，那曾抱我在手里的老敎師的衰老的臉，……這一切都不能再見了，甚至，我親切地想起他們來的機會也很少了。</p>
<p>我走在這曠塲上，憑弔着我幼年的學校，眼淚竟湧出來了。沒有一個過路的人認識我，沒有一個人知道我的心境。我眞願我再回到幼年，挾着書包，拉着哥哥的手去上學校，但這不可能了，我的背已彎了，學校連影子也沒有了啊！</p>
<p>曠塲啊，你吿訴我，我的老師們呢？我的同學們呢？都哪兒去了？哪兒去了？我幼年時的摯友們如今見了面也不再相識了，這眞是無法解脫的哀愁啊！</p>
<p>夕陽掛在遠方的樹梢上了，曠塲上塗着血樣的陽光，如此寂寞的曠塲，它大概也會想起從前的繁華來吧？</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　92</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>據我所受的訓練，除非身臨絕地，四面八方都叫敵人逼了過來，那才只好豁着一條性命，弄他一個兩敗但傷。否則我們須得忍住躁性，細心一步一步做去，直到竭盡了自己的智力，做得滿意，而且不留下任何形跡，讓敵人追索，探尋，叫他們始終莫明其妙，才算成功。我們的總隊長，不也說過，「我們要不惜犧牲，然而又不可作無謂的犧牲」嗎？</p>
<p>設使我們搶上汽車，開槍引火，然後直衝出去的話，那我就要精問了。我們現在巳經知道，衝出這禁衛區，必得經過一座橋，橋上除了裝有那架自動探照燈之外，其他防衛方式，想必緊嚴？萬一這橋是一座活橋，一聲有　，立即移開，或是橋的兩頭都有鋼閘，電網，一類裝置，請問，我們這兩位唐訶詰德式的武士，如何衝得過橋？門口不是還有一道關嗎？難道眞的一無防堵設備？</p>
<p>退一萬步說，即使我們已經衝了出去，他們這裏有的是汽車，裝甲車，卡車，難道還能不追？要是追起來的話，在電影上，倒是觀客們最歡迎的一幕緊張玩意，可叫我們兩人怎樣逃，逃到那裏去？要說逃了一段路，就棄了車，往高梁沙帳裏面去藏起再說，可是我們不能忘了，這禁衛區內，還有不少兇猛　靈的偵探狗和巨獒哩。</p>
<p>我們一路觀察，自從發現汽油站之後，我一直沒有停止安排一個安全走路的方式。我計劃着必須在汽油界內，裝下一個安全的引火器；這引火器必須在我們走了之後，十幾分鐘內才着火爆發。那麼，我們才能安全撤退。所以我把引火的事吿訴了虎弟之後，叫他要聽命令行事，不能鹵莽滅裂的幹。</p>
<p>我退到汽油浸漫的地區之外，把「百寳囊」打開，要把那帶着的綫香盒拿出來。糟透了！這綫香本來就是專門預備這一類引火工作用的，連一盤香多少尺寸，要多少時候，燃燒多少長度，早經試騐過了，這時正用得着。誰知在袋袋內搯去搯來，就不看見這隻綫香盒子。我一氣，把袋內所有東西都傾在地上，一看，那裏有盒子的影子？（後來在回去的路上，方才想起，必是在過溪前，在袋裏　東西吃的當口，沒留心，讓牠滑去了。）</p>
<p>匆匆忙忙把傾出的東西裝好，趕到虎弟那裏，叫他把他的綫香拿出來。他一面不停轉動那唧筒搖手，一面伸手到袋內，只一下就撈了出來。我拿着這寳貝東西，又退到汽油界外，打開盒子一看，天曉得！他　盒香香，那裏是綫香，都變成了粉末，連一寸整的都沒有。想必是天氣悶熱，虎弟雖不出汗，身上潮氣是有的，潮濕侵人了這盒子，再加跑路，跳躑，摔打，將盒裏的香都震碎了。</p>

<h3>不景氣</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>據社會局的朋友吿訴我，根據一年來工潮的性質。加以分類，目前是第四個階段，也是最危險的一個階段</p>
<p>勝利之初，工人們紛紛要求復工，因爲工廠一復員了，這是第一階段的工潮，工廠恢復生產，經濟情况都是好的；以後，工人要求工資按照生活指數發給，這是第二階段的工潮，產品有出路，廠家有盈餘，工人才有此種要求，證明經濟情况也是好的；再後，工人要求增加底薪，這是第三階段的工潮，經濟情况當然不會壞了；可是　　廠家漸呈不支，不是請求停業，就是請求緊縮範圍，裁减人員，工人則要求保障，不得無故解雇，這是　　階段的工潮，性質却與前而的三個階段不同了，它說明了經濟上的不景氣，這是一種危機。</p>
<p>全國性的工業協會和商會聯合會都在南京先後舉行過大會，對當前工商業的危機，已有很具體對策提供當局，年關歲底，日益迫近，金融界將愈形緊張，我們很希望能平平安安地度過這個年頭，看到到各地交通的逐漸恢復，也許我們這一願望不會撲空罷。</p>

<p>十月三十一日本市英文大美晚報刊登了一封讀者來函，題名爲「讓我們　出山國」，投函者自稱爲「中國以前的朋友」，其內容對中國和中國人極盡侮辱的能事：信的開頭就譏諷中國在對日作戰中並無勝仗只有敗績；接着說聯總救濟中國的物資都被中飽；中國人對於美國人的救助毫無感謝；又說中國有排外的立法，有腐敗的司法，中國人只顧自己的家庭，毫無國家觀念，沒有同情，沒有正義，沒有忠誠，沒有一種尊嚴或者標記能够表示他們較禽獸更高級，喜歡虐待禽獸……等等，因此他提議組織「滾川山國」運動，主張所有外人退出中國，並且將外人在華所舉辦的交通事業，自來水和自來火公司，電話公司，醫院，建築物，柏油馬路等等，一槪搬出中國，還在外國制訂排華法律，使中國人在外國也不能立足。</p>
<p>這封信刊出以後，英文大美晚報又於十一月二日把原信重刊一次，同時寫了一篇社論，擁護該信的主張，說信裏寫的全是事實，深得旅華外人的心。因此外國讀者紛紛要求購買該日的報紙，以便剪下寄返本國。該報迫不得已，只好將原信再刊一次，並希望讀者將反對和贊成的意見寫來云云。十一月四日該報就刊有另一個美國人的來信，署名「中國的客人」，駡那位自稱「中國以前的朋友」爲「危險的說謊者」，說他的信裏所說的全非事實，不足代表美國人的意見，並且捐助旅費一千元，希望贊成「滾出中國」者早日離華。十一月五日該報以第三版全頁刊載七封有關該問題的讀者來信，其中三封是外人所寫，四封是中國人所寫，都很長，中國人的信全體一致攻擊所謂「滾出中國』運動，並且譴責大美晚報不應該刊登該信。三封外人的來信中，有一封是反對「滾出中國」的，有兩封是贊成「滾出中國」的，何以贊成呢？有一個沒說明理由，有一個則因爲他道次回到中國，被小偸竊去了一個笛子，內中有一萬二千元美金和其他重要文件，所以覺得中國今非昔比，外人應該退出（此公於十一月八日又來函更正，說他所反對者，只是戰後中國政治經濟的混亂狀態，對於侮辱中國人之點，並不同意，中國人與外人一樣云）。十一月六日，就是中美商的全文公佈的那天，該報仍以第三版全面刊載關於該問題的來信，信共十一封，三封是外人寫的，其中兩封贊成「滾出中國」，一封則持反對的意見；其餘九封中國人的來信）致攻　該報的社論和「中國以前的朋友」的來信。十一月七日該報以社論結束該事件，原來第三版的地位則用來刊登中美商的全文；社論中忽持中立的態度，說每一封來信都出於至誠，有的或許是用血寫就的；結論是「讓過去的成爲過去，以後中外嘗試合作」。然而這事件並沒有結束，十一月八日該報又有三封於該問題的來信，兩封是中國人所寫，攻擊該報濫用友情侮辱中國，越出言論自由的常軌；外人所寫的一封雖不贊成「滾出中國」，但却認爲中國人是「敎而不善」的壞孩子。</p>
<p>中國讀者反響</p>
<p>最使人感動的是十一月九日該報又有三封讀者來信，第一封是一個中國人所寫，義正詞嚴的責備該報言論和措置的不當，說中國政府對於該事件的寬容，足證中國是民主和自由的國家，人民有寬宏大量。</p>
<p>印度人的同情</p>
<p>第二封是「一個印度朋友」所寫，他指出美貨在中國市塲大量傾銷，除了中國，沒有一個國家能够容忍同類的情形；外人來華並非來做好事，因爲他們覺得有利，所以才留在中國；，美國人也有醜的一面，不能隨意批評中國人。</p>
<p>美國婦女的話</p>
<p>第三封照署名和語氣看來，是一個美國女人所寫。她說她曾將這問題和許多朋友討論過，這封信就是討論的結果：首先，她代表美國人民向中國人民道歉，因爲她的一個同胞侮辱了中國，破壞了文明人類應遵守的作　規則；她認爲不應以山國的　點批評山國，美國不是也有　盜，馬路政客，黃色刊物，私刑黨人，滑頭商人，惡訟師，江湖醫生嗎？贊　「滾出中國」的人，都沒有客觀地觀察事實和研究歷史；她和這班人只有一點意見相同：就是這班外人都應該滾出山國，但是所謂交通設備等等却應該留在中國，因爲創辦牠們的外人早已把利潤和代價收回，餘下來的應該屬於那些用血汗和勞力在實際上建築牠們的人　大美晚報刊登這種信件是破壞「言論自由」的原則，對於今日世界所極　需要的互相了解和互相容忍是毫無裨益的。</p>
<p>一塲筆戰就此結束。該報全日社論揭露所謂「中國以前的朋友」是一個國退伍空軍，這一塲筆戰，據該報的意思，是對巾國有益的。所奇怪的是，該報旣稱大多數的外人都贊成「滾出巾國」，何以外人讀者投函的極少，而來函中的三分之一又是投反對票的呢？不過無論眞相如何，大美晚報刋登那篇「危險的說謊者」的妙文，是失常的；以後不能再有此種瘋狂誹謗的妄動！同時，看了美籍讀者對那篇「妙文」的反響後，我們相信多數的美國的友人，都不滿意那篇妙文的！</p>
<h3>救濟品</h3>
<p>— 一葦</p>
<p>的確，這是難胞的一個福音，一批一批的救濟物資運來了。麵粉，豆餅，白芋干，一包一包的，一袋一袋的，堆積如山。不知經過了多少時間，車載船裝，才輾轉的遝到。難胞可有了救星了。</p>
<p>救濟協會通知縣府，縣通知了區，調査，造册經過了幾許時間，才報到縣，縣又轉會。</p>
<p>開會，報吿，討論，應怎樣怎樣的發放！議決了！議決了！如何派員，如何運區，如何發放。</p>
<p>救濟品到區了。某鄕若干，某保若干，大口，小口，每人粉幾斤，餅幾片，白芋干幾斤，限某日領取。</p>
<p>如此這般的難民領到了，打開一看，好極了！麵粉，恐怕難胞吃下去有火氣，特地把許久許久存儲的發給他們；可惡的細菌，偏偏在粉袋裏繁殖起來，作起霉來了。豆餅呢？恐怕難胞牙齒咬不動，一塊兒，一塊兒，破碎了。白芋干呢？一片一片的硬地像石片一樣；且有霜一般的粉末，撒了滿地，原來，蟲兒們早已在裏邊吃胖了。</p>
<p>這是難胞的救濟品！這是難胞的福音！</p>

<h3>「凰求鳳」</h3>
<p>— 男子</p>
<p>每年十一月九日，是美國女人們的「追求男子節」，在各大學的廣塲上，男學生四處奔走，女學生在後面追逐，被捉着的男子就應該和追逐的女子做朋友。這一天，是怨女們最歡愉的節日，她們可以公開的追逐百己心愛的男子，平日女性的尊嚴，早已拋棄精光，一反平素男子追求女子的習慣，改由女子處在主動地位，追逐自己所挑選的男子。在舉行的時候，男子必須盡力奔跑，避免爲女子所捉，於是在廣塲上到處是一男一女，嘻嘻哈哈，追追逐逐，到了末了，很少不是成雙成對的。</p>
<p>這節日的起源是這樣的：許多年前，美國西部獨巴契地方有一個相貌很醜陋的女子，芳名莎蒂，年紀很大却沒存男子追求她。於是她在二十歲生日的那天對她父親說：「爸爸，我今天二十歲了，許多女子在我這年紀都已結了婚，爲什麼我還沒有男朋友？」她父親說：「也許就有人向你求婚哩，你等等罷！」道一等就等了十五年，可憐的莎蒂依然沒有結婚，她父親也憂心起來。在絕望中父親想了一個辦法：在十一月九日那天，她父親把鄕中未結婚的男子都呌了來，對他們說：「孩子們，旣然你們沒有一個人敢討我的女兒，我不得不採取嚴格的辦法！我宣布今天是「莎蒂節」我開放第一下槍的時候，你們馬上開始奔走——當我開放第二下槍的時候——沙帶——她已經讓你們先走——就開始追趕你們，誰讓她捉着誰就是她的丈夫！一，二，三，開始哩！」於是莎蒂終於得到了她的丈夫。其他許多老處女聽見了，都認爲這舉動很有意思，就把十一月九日定爲「莎蒂節」，每年舉行一次。美國人原來是喜熱鬧好新奇的，這節日不久就風行了整個美國。</p>
<p>另外一個使這節日普遍流行的原因，是美國著名漫畫家亞爾加普（All　Capp）在他的長篇運牘漫畫“Lil　Abner”裘，曾經大加渲染地介紹過這個地方風俗，因爲他的漫畫讀者極多，尤其受靑年大學生的歡迎，所以這節日也跟着在大學裏流行，每年舉行的時候，男女學生都穿着跟漫畫裏男女主角相同的服裝。</p>
<p>上海人素來是喜歡倣效美國的，不知道中國大學女生也有勇氣舉行道個節日嗎？（本文係參考英文大美晚報十　一月九日及美國生活雜誌寫成）</p>
<p>新聞人物</p>
<h3>籌備國大的忙人洪蘭友</h3>
<p>— 錦霞</p>
<p>國大開會聲中，身　籌備會秘書長的洪蘭友先生成了要人中間最忙碌的一位。洪先生揚州口音，那些朝夕與洪氏見面接觸的要人同僚，大都以爲他是江都人，其實洪先生原籍安徽徽縣，不過寄籍江都已久。洪先生今年不過四十四歲，已經成爲政海的紅人，關於他的政治生命，確乎可以拿「一帆風順」四字去形容。因爲近在民國二十年六月出版的「中國當代名人錄」裏，還沒有洪氏的大名。</p>
<p>在未轉入政界以前，洪先生在民國十四年竹到上海執業律師，不過並不用目前的名字。洪氏是震且大學法科畢業生，曾任中央政治學校敎授，著有「法學通論」，「中國法學史槪要」兩書。</p>
<p>張道藩氏任首都市政府秘書長時，即以洪氏爲秘書，洪氏的投身政界，原由張氏援引，但是洪是天生的政治人才，更得陳立夫，居覺生兩氏先後信任賞識，從此扶搖直升，大展抱負。</p>
<p>洪先生的尊翁巳作古人，生前寄居揚州，樂善好施，地方公益，無不參予，提起「洪大善人」遠近知名。洪先生也具先人遺風，他現任社會部政務次長，對於社會福利事業，當然也正如我們所期望，能够成績卓著，將先人遺志，發揚光大。</p>
<p>洪先生是一位忙人，閒下來的時間，大部用來讀書，時常手不離卷。除閱讀以外，他簡直可以說沒有旁的嗜好了。</p>
<p>倘若你和洪先生沒有什麼深交，你不知道他到底是江都還是安徽人，不國據筆者所知，洪先生的原籍，確是安徽歙縣。</p>
<p>心理分析家的故事</p>
<h3>無辜的殺人犯　2</h3>
<p>— 許桂庭</p>
<p>魯遜夫人稍爲停一停，再繼續講下去：「阿當回來之後，一切都很好。那條腿也漸漸復元了。連在跳舞的時候，也不礙事。他顯然是很快樂的。不料那晚第一次跳舞回家後，我因爲疲倦的緣故先上床去睡。當我突然醒轉來的時候，阿當居然用雙手抆着我的頭頸，樣子非常難看。那時候，我知道事情總是有點不妙，對這樣體格魁梧的男人是抵抗不來的。我祇好聽諸天命，勉强笑了一下，至少他覺得我微笑了一下。他就立刻放鬆手，對我說：你居然笑！我嗆咳了許久，便答道：我笑過嗎？我爲什麼要笑呢？他忽然間大哭起來。事情就是這樣完結了。」</p>
<p>「可是，事情還不是這樣簡單地結束。自從那次之後，他整個人似乎崩潰了，時常失眠，時常酗酒，是以前從來未曾做過的。有一次在洋台上忽然露着猙獰的面孔，緊握我的身體。我知道他的在性又要發作了，於是向他微笑着，說：「鎭靜些，我的愛！不要做你不喜歡你的母親知道的那些事情。他聽了之後注視着我，似乎很羞慚地大笑一番，於是兩個人大笑了一會，就這樣結束了又一次可怕的遭遇。這的確不是開玩笑的。我希望你能够帮他忙。」</p>
<p>米恩靜默地坐了許久，然後說：「我常然要帮忙你，但是我要警吿你，你繼續和他同居是冒着極大危險的。」</p>
<p>魯遜夫人答：「假使我不和他一起，他恐怕更要不快樂的。他旣然能够拖着」條殘廢的腿跑遍了森林地帶回到我這裏來，我相信我決不能够爲了冒着喉職痛的危險而離開了他罷。」</p>
<p>米恩於是問：「他有來我這裏嗎？」</p>
<p>「大約可以罷。」</p>
<p>「那麼，下星期一罷。」</p>
<p>約定魯遜來米恩的診所的時間是上午十一時，但是過了十五分鐘還不見他來。一直等到十一時半才到。魯遜個子很大，一條腿略現跛狀。穿着一件運動衣和一條法蘭絨褲。米恩遂上前和他招呼。談吐間他總是表示厭世之想。米恩盡他的力量來說服他，的他每星期來三次對談一點鐘。魯遜說；「很好，可是我要預先聲明，我沒有錢來付你的診費的。」米恩說：「讓我們再來商量罷。」魯遜於於是拔脚走了。二十分鐘之後，又跑回來，對米恩說：「喂！你知道麽？我有一次差一點把我的妻子謀殺了。也許她恐怕我會再幹一次，而被判絞刑呢。」</p>
<p>「那麽，爲什麼你不把她謀死呢？」</p>
<p>魯遜蹙一蹙眉頭答：「眞奇怪，連我自己也莫名共妙。好像有一件東西阻止我這樣做，所以我就罷手了。這件事情眞笨透了，我也不能記憶全部的經過。我以爲你應該想知道的罷。」</p>
<p>「唔，對的，」米恩答，『我以爲這件事情是很重要的。」</p>
<p>魯遜說了一聲「再會」，就跑掉了。</p>

<h3>National Assembly Opening Only One Day Away; Overall Situation to Become Clear Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] With only one day remaining before the National Assembly's opening, the government has shown no sign of further postponement. The overall situation will become clear today. Although the Communist Party has repeatedly stated its decision not to submit a list of candidates, other parties may soon do so. Members of the Youth Party held a meeting on the evening of the 13th to discuss the list of representatives. Li Huang is expected to arrive in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 14th to make a final decision. Zhang Junli has also prepared to submit a list, but it is rumored that the Democratic League is still attempting to exert pressure, making the Democratic League the most challenging case currently. The outcome remains uncertain. Furthermore, it is said that military and political negotiations will not be interrupted during the National Assembly; all parties will continue to meet and discuss matters.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] According to an authoritative source, the Communist Party believes that convening the National Assembly will lead to a complete breakdown. We are unsure of their intention, as convening the National Assembly is in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The government is determined to return power to the people and has repeatedly requested all parties to submit their lists of candidates. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party insists on not submitting a list. If they never submit, it implies they intend to prevent the National Assembly from convening. Their motives are unknown.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] The Communist Party Office will hold a press conference on the 14th to explain its attitude towards the current situation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] Thirteen National Assembly representatives registered on the 13th, including the prominent social figure Qian Xinzhi, who completed the procedures in the afternoon. Others include Huang Jilu, Duanmu Kai, and Ma Qingweng. Only 〇6 representatives have not yet registered, some of whom are in Nanjing but have not yet gone to register, while the rest remain in various provinces and cities. The National Assembly is scheduled to open on the 15th. In recent days, various organizations have held tea parties to welcome the representatives. The capital's party, government, and organization organs held a joint tea party on the 13th to welcome all representatives. The Lixingshe (Moral Endeavor Society) is hosting five hundred National Assembly representatives each evening from the 13th to the 15th to watch the "Meng Meinu" opera.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] Jiang Yuntian and others are expected to arrive in Nanjing on the morning of the 14th. Li Zhuchen, a representative of social notables, arrived in Nanjing on the 12th and visited members of the Democratic League on the 13th. Mo Dehui met with Shao Lizi on the morning of the 13th, and Luo Longji was invited to a banquet by Peter on the afternoon of the 13th. The Democratic League held an internal meeting on the morning of the 13th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] The U.S. ambassador met with General Pi Zonggan of the National Government on the morning of the 13th. At 4 p.m., the U.S. ambassador met with Special Envoy Matthews. Weng Wenhao visited Special Envoy Matthews at 6 p.m. for an hour.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a luncheon for Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Hong Lanyou, and others on the 13th.</p>
<p>Zhang Junli to Arrive in Nanjing Today; Carrying Principles for Nomination</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After arriving in Shanghai from Nanjing, Social Democratic Party leader Zhang Junli immediately convened a meeting of party members in Shanghai to discuss the National Assembly issue and exchange views on overall policy. Meetings continued in the morning and afternoon of the 13th. According to party spokesperson Sun Baoyi, the outcome of the two-day discussions is that the Social Democratic Party will make every effort to submit a list of National Assembly candidates. This is not impossible but still requires considerable conditions. The most important requirement is that the government: (1) proceed in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; (2) thoroughly reorganize the government, especially the Executive Yuan. Zhang has prepared to bring these non-negotiable demands to Nanjing and present them to the government authorities. If agreed upon, he can immediately submit the list. Party members unanimously hope that the National Assembly can be postponed until December 1st, during which time they can act in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. They also hope that Chairman Chiang can meet with Mao Zedong to resolve political issues. Zhang believes that there are signs of compromise on all sides regarding the development of the overall situation and that the future is optimistic. When asked whether the Social Democratic Party's list of National Assembly representatives would be submitted simultaneously with the Democratic League and other parties, he said: Our party's quota for National Assembly representatives has been allocated 40 seats from the Democratic League's total of 120 seats. We hope to submit the list simultaneously with the Democratic League, but in certain circumstances, we may also submit it independently. According to our sources, the party's list of National Assembly candidates has not yet been finalized. A list was previously drafted, but if a decision is made to submit it, it will likely be re-established, with slight changes to the previously drafted list. Zhang was originally scheduled to take the night train to Nanjing last night but has now changed his plans to fly on the 14th. Jiang Yuntian arrived in Nanjing last night.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch] Youth Party leader Li Huang returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on the morning of the 12th. According to sources at the party headquarters: Li's return to Shanghai is purely for personal matters. The Youth Party's attitude towards the current situation must be decided in Nanjing. Rumors that Li returned to Shanghai to convene an important party meeting to discuss submitting a list of National Assembly representatives are completely inaccurate. Li will make a brief stopover in Shanghai before proceeding to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Reports of Attacking Yan'an Completely Inaccurate; National Assembly Definitely Will Not Be Postponed Again; Minister Peng Speaks at Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] The Ministry of Information held a tea party at 3:30 p.m. on the 13th in the National Assembly Hall's representatives' lounge, inviting over a hundred Chinese and foreign journalists attending the conference. Minister Peng delivered a speech, welcoming journalists from various regions and expressing his hope for successful reporting. He also answered questions from reporters.</p>
<p>Question: Have various parties submitted their lists of representatives? If not, which parties are expected to submit?</p>
<p>Answer: As of now, we have not received any lists from any parties. Within 36 hours, it will become clear which parties will submit and which will not.</p>
<p>Question: Is there a possibility of the National Assembly being postponed again?</p>
<p>Answer: "No."</p>
<p>Question: If the Communist Party and other parties do not submit lists and refuse to participate, will the government still convene the original representatives to pass the constitution?</p>
<p>Answer: Given the answer to the previous question, this question is redundant. However, the government still hopes that all parties can send representatives to attend the National Assembly. Whether the constitution will be passed at this National Assembly is the prerogative of the National Assembly itself.</p>
<p>Question: What is the military situation like after the ceasefire order was issued?</p>
<p>Answer: In the past, the Communist Party demanded an unconditional and comprehensive ceasefire. Now that the government has issued a ceasefire order, the Communist Party has not taken similar action and claims that the government's move is "hypocritical." However, it is a fact that the National Army has strictly complied with the ceasefire order after receiving the order.</p>
<p>Question: Will foreign diplomatic corps be invited to participate in the opening ceremony of the National Assembly?</p>
<p>Answer: "Yes."</p>
<p>Question: As of now, how many representatives have registered?</p>
<p>Answer: Approximately 1,300.</p>
<p>Question: Is the news of the Communist army fiercely besieging Taierzhuang accurate? What are the details?</p>
<p>Answer: The official side has received similar reports, but the details are unknown. We hope that there will be no such extraordinary incidents.</p>
<p>Question: What is the government's reaction to the remarks made by Xu Fulin, Minister of Propaganda of the Social Democratic Party?</p>
<p>Answer: We have read Mr. Xu's remarks in the newspapers and do not intend to comment on them at this time. However, the government sincerely hopes that all parties can participate in the National Assembly and work together to implement constitutional government. We hope that everyone will pay close attention to the developments in the coming days.</p>
<p>Question: It has long been rumored that the Communist Party delegation is about to withdraw to Yan'an. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: We have not heard anything about this matter.</p>
<p>Question: It is heard that the Youth Party has decided to submit a list of National Assembly representatives. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: You should ask the Youth Party about this matter.</p>
<p>Question: The Chinese Communist Party claims that the National Army intends to attack the outskirts of Yan'an. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: The National Army is still far from Yan'an. We don't know if these outskirts refer to the outskirts thousands of miles away?</p>
<p>Question: It is heard that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek wants to meet with Mao Zedong. Is this true? Answer: If Mr. Mao can come to Nanjing, he will be welcomed.</p>
<p>Question: There are frequent disputes in the Constitution Drafting Committee. Can it be completed as scheduled?</p>
<p>Answer: There must be opposing views in any discussion, but there is no problem that this work will be completed before the 15th.</p>
<p>Question: It is heard that there is internal discord in the Third Force. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: This should probably be asked of the Third Force.</p>
<p>Question: Has the government obtained guarantees from the Youth Party and the Democratic League regarding the submission of lists of National Assembly representatives?</p>
<p>Answer: The Youth Party and the Democratic League have gone to Shanghai to discuss the matter of nominating candidates. Before they return to Nanjing, the government is not in a position to comment on this.</p>
<p>Question: Will the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan be reorganized before the National Assembly convenes?</p>
<p>Answer: The National Government Committee can be reorganized at any time. As for the Executive Yuan, it is an executive agency that cannot be suspended for a single day. There is no possibility of reorganization before the conference.</p>
<p>Question: Has an agreement been reached to first decide on the list for the reorganization of the Executive Yuan and then proceed with the reorganization after the National Assembly convenes?</p>
<p>Answer: We know nothing about this.</p>
<p>Question: The Political Consultative Conference resolutions have not yet been fully implemented before the National Assembly is convened. Has the government considered this point?</p>
<p>Answer: The Political Consultative Conference resolutions have not been fully implemented, but these resolutions cover too broad a range of issues, and issues such as military reorganization are beyond the power of the government alone. Even if we delay for another two months, it will be difficult to fully implement them. Finally, Minister Peng asked the reporters to read the map of the military situation when the ceasefire order was issued and in January after the meeting, and said: "We will see you again on the 15th." The meeting adjourned at 4:45.</p>

<h3>CCP Personnel in Nanjing; Partially Withdraw to Yan'an</h3>
<p>Rumor of Zhou Enlai Also Leaving Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] On the morning of the 12th, 31 members of the Communist Party delegation withdrew from Nanjing and returned to Yan'an on a U.S. military plane. There are now more than 60 people remaining. It is heard that Zhou Enlai has decided to leave Nanjing and return to Yan'an in the near future.</p>
<h3>Sorting out Amendments to the Constitution Draft; Wang Chonghui Explains the Process</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Wang Chonghui attended the joint meeting of the five committees of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 13th and explained the process of sorting out the "Draft Amendment to the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft," stating: I am one of the members of the Constitution Drafting Committee. Based on the principle of consultation, the committee made three amendments in seven meetings. This revised draft is based on the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft as a blueprint and incorporates the opinions of all parties on the constitution draft and the draft proposed by the Constitution Drafting Committee that was not completed. The last two chapters were not resolved by the Constitution Drafting Committee, and the rest were researched or retained. The time to engage in this sorting work was rushed, and omissions are inevitable. However, principles were set during the revision, that is, the fewer changes, the better. At the same time, the President also put forward some instructions. The Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft has been studied by various parties before and after, and there are many insightful points. Now, in response to the requests of all parties, we have revised it with the legacy of the Premier and incorporating the principles of consultation. The revision can be divided into two parts. One is that it is different from the original draft in principle.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Talks Still Yield No Results; Yesterday's Discussion Still Centered on the Constitution Draft</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] The informal comprehensive talks were held at Sun Ke's residence at 3:00 p.m. on the 13th, attended by Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, Mo Dehui, Miao Jiaming, Chen Qitian, Zeng Qi, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, and Zhang Bojun. Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai did not attend, but Dong Biwu went alone. It is heard that the discussion on the 13th still focused on the constitution draft. After the meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m., Shao Lizi and Lei Zhen went to visit the President to report on the situation and only returned at 10:00 p.m. Lei refused to make any comments. According to members of the Democratic League, today's meeting was very simple and yielded no results. It is not yet known whether a meeting will be held on the 14th, but the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social notables will still hold a meeting at the Jiaotong Bank on the morning of the 14th and take a group photo. The other part is those that have changed accordingly due to changes in principle. In terms of the latter, the changes are not very many. Then, the revised version was explained item by item. There are not many revisions to Chapter 2, "Rights and Obligations of the People." The purpose of the revised version is the same as the original draft, only the starting point is different. The revision of this chapter is based on the principle of Article 9 of the Political Consultative Conference Constitution Draft Resolution, that is, if the freedom of the people is stipulated by law, it must come from the spirit of protecting freedom and not be aimed at restriction. Therefore, all the words "cannot be restricted except in accordance with the law" in the original constitution draft have been deleted. In other words, we start from the point of protecting freedom and do not emphasize restriction. At the same time, Article 24 "Regarding the freedoms and rights listed above, they shall not be restricted by law except to prevent hindering the freedom of others," so the Legislative Yuan will be somewhat restricted when drafting laws in the future, and cannot casually draft laws regarding the rights of the people. Regarding the National Assembly, the Political Consultative Conference also has a resolution. According to the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft, the National Assembly is held once every three years, gathering more than 2,000 people together. What should be done the rest of the time is a real problem. For example, the National Assembly has the power to impeach the president and initiate the constitution, but it cannot impeach the president and initiate the constitution every day. The Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee modified it, and there are detailed regulations on the meeting period and convening of temporary meetings. The organization and functions of the National Assembly are also different from the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft. According to the Constitution Drafting Committee, the legislators and supervisors elected from all regions are representatives of the National Assembly. This can create a connection between the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan and the National Assembly. Therefore, paragraphs one and two are added to Article 26, and the functions and powers are also different. In addition to electing and impeaching the president and vice president, the National Assembly's functions and powers are to handle and ratify amendments to the constitution. The amendment to the constitution draft proposed by the Legislative Yuan, it is not easy for more than 2,000 people gathered together to deliberate on laws, but it is better to deliberate on principles. This point is the same as the foreign initiation system. After the National Assembly formulates the principles, it will be handed over to the legislative body for completion, but it still has the power of veto. The amendments to the constitution draft proposed by the Legislative Yuan can be re-voted. Chapter 4, "President," is revised based on Article 7 of the Political Consultative Conference Constitution Draft Resolution. Article 44 of the revised draft is the most important. This article stipulates how the president issues emergency orders. The revised draft stipulates that during the recess of the Legislative Yuan, the president may issue emergency orders in accordance with the Emergency Order Law after the resolution of the Executive Council. This point is not found in the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft. In other words, the president cannot issue emergency orders during the sessions of the Legislative Yuan. At the same time, the president must issue them in accordance with emergency orders, so the responsibilities are clear. The period for submitting them to the Legislative Yuan for ratification has also been shortened from three months to one month, which is more in line with standards and can avoid unnecessary disputes.

<h3>Zhang Qun to Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Sichuan Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun, who went to the United States to recuperate from illness, left the United States and transferred to Tokyo to return to China after being summoned by the authorities. He flew to Shanghai this morning. Zhang will make a brief stopover in Shanghai to informally exchange views with leaders from various parties before proceeding to Nanjing to seek instructions from the President and attend the National Assembly. Social Democratic Party leader Zhang Junli, who was originally scheduled to go to Nanjing last night, decided to postpone his departure temporarily in order to have discussions with Zhang after he arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Holds Joint Committee Meeting; Constitution Draft Put on Hold Due to Procedural Issues; Sun Ke Asks Wu Dingchang to Complete Procedures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] The Legislative Yuan held a Constitution Draft Review Meeting on the morning of the 13th, attended by over 60 members including Liu Keshun, Chen Xunyu, Chen Changheng, Situ De, and Jian Guansan, chaired by Lin Bin, Chairman of the Legislative Committee. Wang Chonghui, Secretary-General of the National Defense Supreme Council, and Wu Jingxiong, Minister to the Holy See, were both present. Wang explained the revision process and elaborated on the added articles, lasting for eighty minutes. Wu then made supplementary explanations, after which both withdrew. The Revised Draft of the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft Amendment was based on the unfinished draft of the Political Consultative Conference Constitution Draft Review Committee and was sorted out by Wang Chonghui, Wu Jingxiong, Lei Zhen, and others. The Political Consultative Conference Constitution Drafting Committee will review it again soon to make it even better. At today's meeting, because the case was submitted directly by the President, and according to the law, the case submitted for discussion must be proposed by the Central Standing Committee or the National Defense Committee, and because there were questions about legislative procedure, the majority of the members believed that it should not be submitted for discussion. When it was decided to adjourn the meeting for a while and report the matter to President Sun for handling, the meeting adjourned at 11:25.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] After the Legislative Yuan Joint Review Committee meeting on the morning of the 13th, Chairman Lin Bin immediately went to visit Sun Ke to report on the situation of the Review Committee. Sun immediately telegraphed Wu Wenzhang of the National Government to complete the procedures regarding the completion of the procedures, but as to whether the amendment should be reviewed, he believed that the Legislative Yuan was responsible to the central government and could not insist on dissent. He planned to separately meet with each member to give advice. The joint meeting may be reopened on the 16th in order to complete the review of the case and submit it to the National Assembly for discussion.</p>
<h3>At the Joint Review Committee of the Five Committees of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Ning Yuan</p>
<p>After the National Assembly Opening was postponed, the various parties and social notables were considering whether to submit lists and attend the meeting, and the constitution draft, which was about to be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion, was also stranded in the Legislative Yuan. The difficulties of the current situation have reached their climax at this time.</p>
<p>On the 11th of this month, based on President Chiang's Jia (November 9th) National Government Jiaojing No. 798〇 Tongdai Telegram, the Legislative Yuan convened a temporary meeting to discuss the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft Amendment drafted by Sun Ke and four other government members of the Constitution Drafting Committee. On the same day, member Liu Xun first raised an objection. In the end, Chairman Sun, because he was discussing procedural issues at the time, stopped his speech, and white-haired old member Liu declared his withdrawal. The atmosphere at the meeting that day was very tense, and many people expressed silent sympathy. Finally, a bomb that resonated with Liu was detonated at the Joint Review Committee meeting of the Five Committees on the 13th.</p>
<p>After Wang Liangchou and Wu Jingxiong explained the process of revision, the first to launch an attack was member Di Junwu. Member Di first spoke on legislative procedures, believing that the Legislative Yuan could only discuss proposals generated in three ways: first, resolutions of the Central Standing Committee; second, resolutions of the Central Political Council, that is, the National Defense Supreme Council, which now exercises its functions; and third, proposals from the legislators themselves. The constitution draft amendment sent down by the National Government on behalf of the government did not belong to any of the three generated above. Member Di believed that this was an unprecedented precedent in the Legislative Yuan. If the issues under discussion were not important, that would be fine, but now we are discussing the national law of the century, and if we accept the discussion rashly, we will be blamed by people for thousands of years to come. Secondly, regarding the content issues, the revision principles of all the amendments are based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but they clearly conflict with the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee. The government still belongs to the Kuomintang's command of the party, and we can only accept the instructions of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and cannot be bound by the Political Consultative Conference, which has no legal basis. If we do not accept the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, we are violating our duties. His conclusion was that based on these two premises, whether we can accept the revised draft for review is a matter worthy of consideration by this reporter.</p>
<p>After Member Di's impassioned speech, Member Chen Haicheng also raised similar accusations. Member Chen pointed out three points: first, should the opinions of the Political Consultative Conference and the Comprehensive Group be accepted? Second, should the hospital be bound by the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee? Third, if the revised draft violates the legacy of the Founding Father of the Republic of China, should the hospital correct it?</p>
<p>At this time, Chairman Lin Bin repeatedly spoke, asking everyone to first raise any questions and ask the attending Mr. Wang Liangchou and Mr. Wu Jingxiong to answer, and to delay the discussion of the content and principles. At this time, Mongolian member Qi Zhihou stood up again, believing that it should first be decided whether the draft should be accepted for discussion. If it is not discussed, there is no need to raise questions. Member Chen Changxin had just said two sentences on the principle issues when he was shouted down from behind his seat. Under this situation, Mr. Wang Liangchou and Mr. Wu Jingxiong had no choice but to withdraw first.</p>
<p>At this time, there was another episode. Suiyuan member Wu Yunpeng stood up and said that several Mongolian representatives had come to the hospital to visit and had opinions on the constitution draft. He hoped to give them a chance to speak. Then someone interrupted him and said that since we are discussing the constitution draft today, there is no need to ask them to speak here. Wu Yunpeng believed that since they had come from afar, the hospital should at least send someone to talk to them. In a hurry, the chairman designated members Di and Zhang Fengjiu to meet with them.</p>
<p>The question was asked again about the constitution draft. Everyone argued for a while. Several people shouted to adjourn the meeting and looked like they were about to leave, and the order was very chaotic. At this time, Member Li Qingchen spoke, saying that whether we discuss it or not, the order of the meeting must be maintained, otherwise it will almost be a drama.</p>
<p>Everyone calmed down.</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Bin stood up to report that, according to him: President Sun had talked with several legislators yesterday (the 12th) afternoon, reporting the progress of the revision of the constitution draft and explaining the situation of the negotiations in recent days. The president's view is that except for the Chinese Communist Party, which has not yet expressed an opinion that it can participate, other parties seem to be preparing to attend, so the Comprehensive Group is now discussing the unfinished constitution draft amendment, and perhaps it will propose the entire amendment in the next few days. If we discuss this unfinished amendment now, we may have to reorganize it again at that time. Therefore, Lin advocated that the Review Committee be temporarily postponed until it is studied again after the National Assembly opens on the 15th.</p>
<p>Member He Sui supplemented the chairman's opinion, saying that since the constitution draft amendment sent by President Chiang's telegram did not comply with the legal procedures, we can complete this procedure while we wait.</p>
<p>Finally, the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting and stated that the situation discussed today would be reported to President Sun.</p>
<p>After the meeting, President Sun Changran was the first to receive the news, followed by Minister Wu Dingchang, and finally Secretary-General Wu of the Central Party Department. Everyone was discussing how to complete the legal procedures separately. The Civil Service Department may transfer the case to the Central Secretariat, and the Central Secretariat should of course immediately convene a meeting of the Central Standing Committee, but the difficult problem encountered by the Central Standing Committee is whether it can change the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee. If it is to be completely legal, the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee must be convened, but the National Assembly will open the day after tomorrow, and there is no time to convene the Plenary Session again. The final solution to the problem depends on the President's right of adjudication. Therefore, the hardworking and conscientious leader of the Kuomintang has to personally bear this heavy responsibility again.</p>
<p>The so-called procedural problem, although seemingly difficult, is ultimately easy to solve. As for the content problem, it is really a fundamental problem. Undoubtedly, this amendment is very different from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy. If the country can achieve long-term stability and peace from now on, then Mr. Sun Yat-sen's followers will only accept it with determination. The problem is that even if they accept this unwilling amendment, the Communists and members of various parties will not necessarily all attend the National Assembly. Therefore, some people believe that since this is the case, why should the Kuomintang honestly accept this amendment first? It is better to wait for a while and calculate that when the parties have the sincerity to participate in the National Assembly, it will not be too late to consider its amendments. The reason why Lin Bin wanted to wait until the opening day of the National Assembly to propose it for discussion was actually for this reason.</p>

<h3>Mr. Gu Weijun Delivers a Speech: The Future of Sino-U.S. Trade is Bright, Urging the U.S. Business Community Not to Be Impatient</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 12th Dispatch from United Press] Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, recently addressed the National Foreign Trade Convention, urging the U.S. business community not to be discouraged by the temporary inability to fully restore Sino-U.S. trade, nor to be impatient. Mr. Gu stated: "The unstable situation in China is merely an inevitable stage in the process of national unification. This unification is a necessary condition for the development of trade and other constructive endeavors. Once the country achieves unification, stability will naturally follow, and political, economic, and social reforms and construction will be able to proceed and advance towards success. The Chinese government is currently working to improve transportation for imports and within the interior. Furthermore, it is promoting land reform. China's current economic situation can be roughly compared to that of the United States after the Civil War. The potential for trade with the United States is truly limitless, and the long-term outlook is also very broad. The first step in China's industrialization plan is to raise living standards, and the second step is to increase purchasing power. This will ultimately greatly increase China's demand for American products, such as telephones, radios, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, etc. In terms of the balance of payments in Sino-U.S. trade, China has historically been a country with an import surplus. Therefore, we must industrialize our country, increase production, and increase exports, so that paying for imports will be easier. "Mr. Gu continued: "The most enlightened and liberal policy embodied in the U.S.-China Treaty of Commerce gives us reason to predict the future of trade relations between the two countries with legitimate speculation and confidence. An important factor in the new treaty for developing trade in China with the U.S. is that all of Chinese territory is open to American merchants. The basic principle of the treaty is equality and reciprocity. The American people can always rely on the goodwill of the Chinese people. There is a constant open door of friendship between the two peoples, and Sino-U.S. trade aids each other's needs. Some American merchants are unable to compete with Chinese exporters, such as pig bristles, certain minerals, raw silk, and tea, as these are not products of the United States. Chinese embroidery, lace, and linen weaving require high skills and take a long time to produce, and it is impossible to produce them with the high labor costs in the United States. However, on the other hand, American steel, iron, lumber, wheat, flour, and cotton textiles cannot be matched by Chinese production." Mr. Gu also stated that automobiles, railways, and ships can only gain a limited market in China.</p>
<h3>Fan Xuande Delivers a Speech: Discussing the "No-Investment Policy"</h3>
<p>Hoping that the National Assembly of Our Country Can Reach a Wise Agreement</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 12th Dispatch] Fan Xuande, Director of the Far East Division of the State Department, said in a speech at the Foreign Trade Association today that China's foreign exchange and foreign trade regulations are only a temporary tranquilizer. The United States government and private sector should not invest in countries where there is widespread corruption among officials, merchants cheat each other, and the government wastes resources on excessive armaments. Fan Xuande also listed the countries involved in this "no-investment policy," such as those where civil wars have already occurred or are about to occur, those where government monopolies exclude American merchants, and those where anti-democratic elements control the government. He made every effort to avoid naming these countries. Earlier, in his speech, Fan Xuande stated: "The State Department hopes that China can avoid the disaster of continued internal conflict, and hopes that the future National Assembly can reach a wise agreement. The stability and recovery of the Chinese economy is being hindered by its unfortunate political and military situation. The current foreign exchange and foreign trade regulations are only sufficient to address the immediate crisis."</p>

<h3>The UNRRA Far East Regional Committee: Yan Huiqing Re-Elected as Chairman, Li Zhuomin and the Dutch Representative as Vice-Chairmen</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The UNRRA Far East Regional Committee held a meeting at the Bank of China Building yesterday morning from 9:30 a.m. Attendees included representatives from eight countries: China, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Australia, India, and the Netherlands. The committee first held an informal meeting to discuss the issue of who would succeed Chairman Jiang Tingfu after his resignation. After unanimous selection, Dr. Yan Huiqing was re-elected as chairman, and Dr. Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan, and Dutch representative Stark were elected as vice-chairmen. The list of representatives attending was: Yan Huiqing and Li Zhuomin from China; Gabriel Cluett from the United States; Hall from Australia and New Zealand; Stanley and Ms. Hender from the United Kingdom; Bletian from France; Stark from the Netherlands; Xibannas from the Soviet Union; Hanson from India; and General Egerton, UNRRA representative in China.</p>
<p>Huo Baoshu Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>During the meeting, Dr. Yan Huiqing specially introduced Huo Baoshu, Director-General of the Executive Yuan, to everyone to express his welcome. Director Huo then stood up to express his thanks and said: "I deeply admire all the representatives for their past efforts and contributions to the post-war relief work in the Far East. I now assure you that I will do my best within the scope of my duties to assist in the mission entrusted to you by the UNRRA General Assembly. However, I firmly believe that no one in this committee hopes that the Far East Regional Committee will develop into a judging body, and further inquire into UNRRA's administrative work in the Far East or interfere with the purely administrative issues of the recipient countries. Recently, the Executive Yuan's efforts to clear materials from the port of Shanghai have promoted the resumption of UNRRA shipments to China. Director-General La Guardia has announced the full resumption of shipments to China, and materials will be shipped as soon as the US maritime workers' strike is resolved. However, on the other hand, the scope of the UNRRA supply plan has not been determined, the exact dates and contents of the shipments have not been determined, and the working period of UNRRA technical experts in China has not been determined, which affects the work of the Executive Yuan. I hope that this committee will seriously discuss and resolve these issues. More than half of the total amount of materials that UNRRA plans to supply to China has yet to be shipped to China. I firmly believe that the next UNRRA General Assembly will be able to give us a guarantee that UNRRA will not end before it has completed its work, because without this guarantee, the work cannot be carried out smoothly. Therefore, I sincerely hope that this committee will make a clear and firm recommendation to the next UNRRA General Assembly."</p>
<p>After Director Huo finished his speech, the representatives of various countries began to discuss various issues. Dr. Yan also read out the General Assembly resolution, unanimously expressing respect for Jiang Tingfu and expressing admiration and enthusiasm for his contributions to the Executive Yuan over the past six months.</p>
<p>Overview of Refugee Repatriation</p>
<p>The General Assembly discussed the issue of refugee repatriation, and Dr. Shabao reported on the progress of the work. To date, the committee has repatriated 1,900 overseas Chinese to Myanmar and 918 to Singapore. If the Myanmar government approves, another 12,000 overseas Chinese will be repatriated, and by the end of June next year, 33,000 overseas Chinese will be repatriated to various places. In addition to the US$300,000 already approved by UNRRA, another US$1.9 million has been requested for the repatriation of refugees from various countries. With the approval of the authorities, 2,000 Austrian refugees will be repatriated from China. However, due to the difficult economic situation in Germany, it is not easy to repatriate German nationals for the time being. Several Czech and Yugoslav nationals are currently being repatriated each month, and reports have been received from Italy that ships have been dispatched to China to pick up Italian nationals. All of them can be transported by the end of December.</p>
<p>Other issues, such as UNRRA's relief medical supplies to China, cotton spinning, industry, and other relief supplies, will be reserved for discussion in the subcommittees or at today's meeting.</p>
<p>The committee held a subcommittee meeting yesterday afternoon, and the General Assembly will continue to meet at 9:30 a.m. today.</p>

<h3>Impeachment of Sheng Shicai: Investigation Established, Moved to Disciplinary Action; Criminal Portion Transferred to the Court</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The Xinjiang Provincial Provisional Assembly and the general public have repeatedly accused Sheng Shicai, the former chairman of the province, of violating laws and disciplines, being brutal and greedy, and committing various crimes during his tenure. After investigation by Supervisory Committee members Yan Zhuang and Wang Xinling of the Control Yuan, an impeachment was filed and, after investigation, was established and moved to disciplinary action. The criminal portion was sent to the court for investigation and trial in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Amidst the National Army's Observance of the Ceasefire Order, Yan'an Convenes a Mobilization Meeting; Communist Troops in Northeast and Shandong Continue to Attack</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] In order to seek peaceful unification, the government took the initiative to issue a ceasefire order, which came into effect at noon on the 11th. However, the Communist Party has not yet indicated that it will cease operations and is preparing to launch a major war. According to Yan'an Broadcasting on the 12th, the Central Committee of the Communist Party convened a so-called mobilization meeting of cadres to defend the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and Yan'an. More than a thousand cadres from all sides attended. Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, and Liu Shaoqi spoke one after another, unanimously calling on everyone to learn combat techniques, such as laying landmines and throwing grenades, in preparation for fighting.</p>
<p>[Report from Beiping, this newspaper, 13th] Zheng Jiemin, the government member of the Military Mediation Department, had not received a reply from the Communist Party regarding the ceasefire memorandum as of the 13th. Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Government, told reporters on the 13th: "The executive department's supervision of the ceasefire is unable to do anything because the Communist Party has not adopted a cooperative attitude. It is generally judged that the frozen state of the executive department cannot be changed until the three-person military group in Nanjing reaches an agreement on specific measures for the ceasefire." When asked by reporters whether the Communist army had taken any military action after noon on November 11, Cai replied: "In the areas northwest of Nong'an in the Northeast and Anqiu, Linzi in Shandong, and Yulin in Shaanxi, the Communist army continued to take offensive action."</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Attack Huaide: Battalion Commander Feng Dies in Battle</h3>
<p>[Report from Shenyang, this newspaper, 13th] At 3:00 p.m. on the 11th, about 2,000 Communist troops suddenly surrounded Huaide, south of Changchun. Battalion Commander Feng Yongchang led 300 men to resist. After two hours of fierce fighting, the officers and soldiers suffered heavy casualties due to the disparity in numbers. Battalion Commander Feng died in battle. The situation in the city was unclear at dusk. The electrical team transmitted the news here. This is the first unfortunate incident after the issuance of the ceasefire order.</p>
<p>[Report from Xuzhou, this newspaper, 13th] The National Army on the front lines of Erhuai in northern Jiangsu, southern Shandong, and western Shandong all complied with the order to stop advancing by noon on the 11th. However, on the evening of the 11th, the Communist army in southern Shandong simultaneously launched a large-scale attack on Guocun and Dongxi Zouwuwu and other places on the Taizao branch line and the Linzao branch line. The Shan Jialin Bridge was blown up. After a fierce battle until the morning of the 12th, the Communist army was repelled, but the National Army did not pursue them. However, the government's ceasefire order was sent to the Communist side to urge them to pay attention to their responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Compiling Constitutional Draft Amendments: Wang Chonghui Explains the Process</h3>
<p>Continued from Page One</p>
<p>Chapter 5, which stipulates the executive branch, is the focus of attention from all parties. This section is drafted based on Article 6 of the Political Consultative Conference. However, the second paragraph of that article states that if the Legislative Yuan expresses a vote of no confidence in the Executive Yuan as a whole, the Executive Yuan may either resign or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan. This point raised great doubts at the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, as it was far from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. The Drafting Committee deleted this paragraph. This clause caused the most controversy. At the same time, there was much discussion outside about the provisions of Article 56, which stipulate that the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan. In fact, this provision does not necessarily mean that it is a presidential system or a cabinet system, because there is no power of no confidence and the Executive Yuan has no power to dissolve it, so it is different from the cabinet systems of England and France. At the same time, there is also the provision that "when the Legislative Yuan maintains its original resolution upon reconsideration, the head of the Executive Yuan shall accept or resign." This is something that is not available in the United States, which adopts a presidential system, and it is also superior to the presidential system. In addition, after the president "resigns", the president can select a new head of the Executive Yuan to consult with the Legislative Yuan, so that there is more room for maneuver, and the president can also avoid directly conflicting with the Legislative Yuan. In the United States, political affairs are often delayed due to conflicts between the president and Congress, and the revised draft has a provision that "two-thirds of the members of the Legislative Yuan maintain their original resolution." There is room for consultation between the two parties, and I hope that all parties can calmly discuss it and compare it with the presidential cabinet system of foreign countries.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, Legislative Branch, is revised based on Article 2 of the Government Agreement. Zhang Junmai strongly argued against Article 3, which states that "The Legislative Yuan shall not propose to increase expenditures on budget proposals submitted by the Executive Yuan." The reason for this provision is that if the Legislative Yuan can propose to increase the budget, then the legislators elected by the provinces and cities can all propose increases and exchange voting rights, making it difficult for the Executive Yuan. Therefore, it is stipulated that expenditures cannot be increased. Articles 83 in the Judiciary and Examination branches stipulate that judges must be independent of parties and conduct trials independently based on the law. However, Article 92 stipulates that members of the Examination Yuan must be independent of parties. This is an omission. The powers of the Control Yuan include an additional power of "consent." Articles 95 and 96 are also different from the original draft constitution.</p>
<p>The chapter on the powers of the central and local governments is drafted based on Article 2 of Article 8 of the Political Consultative Conference. The powers of the two are divided in detail, and regulations are made in accordance with the principle of balanced power, and there is room for flexibility. Regarding judicial, financial, and economic matters, which originally belonged to the local government, the highest authorities later changed them to belong to the central government. If there is a dispute over the powers of the central and local governments, it will be resolved by the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the provisions of Article 110. This is also a new approach. Regarding the issue of provincial constitutions, the Political Consultative Conference stipulated that "provinces may formulate provincial constitutions." Later, after being revised by the Constitutional Draft Review Committee, it was changed to "provinces may formulate self-government laws." There was much debate over the issue of whether provincial self-government laws should be approved by the central government. The provisions of Article 113 state that "If the Judicial Yuan believes that there is a violation of the constitution, it shall declare the constitutional provisions invalid" and must be sent to the Judicial Yuan within one month after formulation, so it can be implemented. This is a compromise.</p>
<p>Wu Jingxiong's Explanation</p>
<p>[Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 13th] Wu Jingxiong explained the process of compiling the draft "Revised Draft of the Fifth-Fifth Constitutional Draft" at a joint meeting of the Fifth Committee of the Legislative Yuan on the 13th. He said that rumors that the principles of the Political Consultative Conference Constitution had been changed were launched by the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, which is clearly inconsistent with the facts. The Constitutional Draft Review Committee met before the Second Plenary Session was convened. When the Constitutional Draft Review Committee met, we proposed that some resolutions should be revised, and there were disputes at that time. For example, on the first point, according to the Political Consultative Conference resolution, the National Assembly was an invisible National Assembly. The government representatives argued based on scholarship and logic. We cannot be considered to have broken faith because of this. Moreover, the Political Consultative Conference decided at that time to organize a Constitutional Draft Review Committee, which left a margin for discussion on the issue of the constitution. If there were good suggestions on the constitution from all parties, they could be put forward. We provided opinions to the Constitutional Draft Review Committee based on this spirit, hoping to revise it. Second, according to the provisions of the second paragraph of Article 6 of the Fifth Resolution of the Political Consultative Conference, "If the Legislative Yuan expresses a vote of no confidence in the Executive Yuan as a whole, the Executive Yuan may either resign or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan, but the same head of the Executive Yuan may not request to dissolve the Legislative Yuan again." This article is tantamount to establishing a complete cabinet system, which is contrary to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. When our representatives participated in the Constitutional Draft Review Committee, they believed that it should be revised. Finally, regarding the issue of provincial constitutions, we also strongly argued in the Constitutional Draft Review Committee and decided to change it to provincial self-government law. All of the above are sufficient to prove that we had strongly argued before the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee was convened, and it was not formally proposed after the Second Plenary Session. This point should be stated. The above three points have been agreed upon in the Constitutional Draft Review Committee, and this compilation is partially based on the above three principles for revision.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Today is the Last Day!</h3>
<p>The National Assembly was postponed for three days, and two days have already passed. Only today, the last day, remains. The current situation has reached its peak today, and the urgency of the moment is like a hair's breadth. The people across the country are looking towards Nanjing, hoping for good news to arrive at every moment. However, what we see in the newspapers is either that a portion of the CCP delegation has already flown back to Yan'an on American planes, or that Yan'an has issued a general mobilization order, preparing for counter-attacks on all fronts. This is completely contrary to what our people hope for. The CCP's actions are truly disappointing.</p>
<p>Recalling that after the enemy surrendered last year, Mr. Mao Zedong responded to Chairman Chiang's invitation to meet in Chongqing, and the CCP representatives chanted slogans of peace and democracy. At that time, it seemed very pleasant to our simple-minded people. Because after the victory of the war of resistance, what our people longed for day and night was peace and democracy. Thereafter, peace talks experienced twists and turns. Until recently, although we felt the CCP's attitude was unreasonable, we still did not express despair, and ultimately believed that the CCP would have a day of sudden realization. Even this newspaper, standing on the side of the people, repeatedly wrote articles advising the CCP to prioritize the country, lay down its butcher knives, and achieve enlightenment. At this moment, a thorough awakening would still not be too late. However, we have already exhausted our earnest words and advice. Lately, we have almost nothing to say. We only feel that the CCP's attitude is truly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The CCP both desires peace and has requested that the government immediately cease fire. However, when the government issued a ceasefire order, the CCP not only did not issue a ceasefire order itself, but instead said that it was a unilateral decision and expressed its disagreement. How can such far-fetched arguments be convincing! Furthermore, the CCP repeatedly claims to want democracy, but when the government decided to convene the National Assembly to return power to the people and implement constitutional government, the CCP not only did not welcome it, but instead tried every possible means to obstruct it, causing the National Assembly to be repeatedly postponed. Even on the eve of the opening, it was decided to postpone it for another three days. Logically, the CCP should also participate, but the CCP is still not satisfied and insists on preventing the National Assembly from convening. Time is passing! In the blink of an eye, two days have passed, and have been missed. Only today, the last day, remains, but the CCP's attitude not only shows no sign of sudden awakening, but has instead intensified and become even more stubborn. Zhou Enlai not only threatened the government by saying that "the government should bear the responsibility for the breakdown of peace talks," but also threatened our people by having the CCP delegation prepare to return to Yan'an. Since the CCP wants democracy, what reason can it have to oppose the Kuomintang returning power to the people? This truly perplexes us greatly! As for the three conditions proposed by Zhou Enlai for the CCP to participate in the National Assembly, there is also really no reason to speak of. It is not worth arguing about. According to reports, these three conditions are: (1) The government must first be reorganized; (2) The draft constitution decided by the informal talks of the Political Consultative Conference's comprehensive group must be guaranteed to be passed by the National Assembly; (3) The list of CCP delegates participating in the National Assembly must be submitted to the reorganized government.</p>
<p>The process of the peace talks, in the eyes of our people, is as clear as day and does not need to be repeated. The delay in the government's reorganization was also caused by the CCP's obstruction, needless to say. As for the draft constitution, the Three Principles of the People are the principles unanimously believed in by the people of the country, and the CCP also recognizes the Three Principles of the People as the supreme principle for nation-building. If a constitution is drafted in accordance with the Three Principles of the People, it will surely be passed by the National Assembly without a doubt. There is really no need for guarantees.</p>
<p>In short, we have always respected the CCP's position in domestic politics, and we still hope that the CCP can plan for its own future and not abandon itself. What the CCP has expressed in recent days is no different from abandoning itself to the people of the country. We truly feel sorry for the CCP. Today is the last day, and we are still here hoping for the CCP's sudden awakening!</p>
<h3>Review of the Trusteeship System</h3>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly began discussing the issue of colonial trusteeship on the fourth of this month. Because the United Nations Charter does not provide clear and practical regulations for the trusteeship system, the First United Nations General Assembly, which was held in London, did not reach any agreement on this thorny issue. As a result, the representatives of various countries, especially the representatives of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States, still have not made any progress in interpreting what constitutes "directly concerned states." However, the issue of colonial trusteeship is not only related to the future destiny of tens of millions of people, but also closely related to world peace. Therefore, the United Nations General Assembly will continue to discuss this issue in the next few days, so that the United Nations organization can formally establish a Trusteeship Council during the Second General Assembly. Britain and the United States have already put forward a proposal on this issue, and although the Soviet Union has expressed its dissent, it is expected to be passed by the United Nations General Assembly as a result of the British and American representatives' contacts with other countries' representatives. Therefore, the Trusteeship Council may soon be formally established.</p>
<p>In the era of capitalist imperialism, colonies have always been the object of contention for various countries. They even resorted to arms in order to seize colonies, leading to devastating wars. The First World War can indeed be regarded as a war in which various capitalist imperialist powers fought for colonies, and the Second World War was also a war of the same nature. Therefore, far-sighted politicians and diplomats at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 painstakingly sought a reasonable solution to the colonial issue, and the League of Nations Mandate System came into being. The mandate system itself is theoretically an ideal system, but in practice, it not only failed to realize the ideal of the mandate system, but the mandated territories became colonies in disguise. On the contrary, it made the colonial issue even more complicated. After the Second World War, politicians and diplomats of various countries all felt that the mandate system had to be abolished and that another new system should be created to replace it. The trusteeship system was proposed at the San Francisco Conference. At that time, due to the urgency of time, it was not possible to discuss it at length, and only a few principles were stipulated. A precise definition of "directly concerned states" was not given. In January of this year, when the United Nations General Assembly held its first meeting in London, the issue of trusteeship became a pending issue in the international community, once again because of differences of opinion among various countries.</p>
<p>After the United Nations General Assembly opened in New York this time, representatives of various countries requested that the issue of trusteeship be discussed, and it began to be discussed on the fourth of this month. First, representatives of various countries delivered speeches one after another. In the speeches of various people, it was discovered that the interpretations of the so-called "directly concerned states" by various countries were different. After discussing this for a week, no clue was obtained. The key still lies in the fact that the views of the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain are diametrically opposed. The United States has also submitted a draft trusteeship agreement to the Trusteeship Committee for the islands in the Pacific that were previously代 by Japan. In principle, it also advocates that the islands in the Pacific that were previously代 by Japan should be completely transferred to the United Nations trusteeship; however, the United States still requests to retain its management rights. This is no different from the United States requesting sole trusteeship. At the same time, the United States is planning to establish military bases on these islands, which will naturally arouse the suspicion of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Novikov, first expressed his dissent, and the countries of the Slavic bloc, who followed the Soviet Union's lead, also echoed it. It is said that the Soviet Union has a different interpretation of "directly concerned states." Therefore, the Soviet representative proposed that "after the Trusteeship Council is established, when discussing any trusteeship 恊 定 案 proposed by any country, the five countries of China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union will automatically become "directly concerned" and have the right to veto the draft agreement. It is naturally impossible for Britain and the United States to agree with the Soviet Union's view. If things are done according to the Soviet Union's proposal, the draft trusteeship agreement proposed by the United States will never be approved by the Trusteeship Council. Therefore, on the eleventh, the United States again notified all member states of the Trusteeship Committee, formally stating that if the Trusteeship Committee cannot agree with the proposal put forward by the United States, then the United States will retain what has already become a fact, that is, permanently control the islands in the Pacific that were previously代 by Japan, such as the Marshall Islands, the Caroline Islands, and the Mariana Islands. When the Trusteeship Committee met on the eleventh, the Soviet representative Novikov again made a long speech, criticizing the draft trusteeship agreements proposed by Britain, the United States, France, Australia, Belgium, and the South African Federation one by one, and denounced them as fundamentally contrary to the principles revealed in the United Nations Charter. In this way, in the United Nations General Assembly, the rift caused by the different views of the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain on the issue of trusteeship became even more blatant. Although the Soviet representative also expressed his hope that the Trusteeship Council could be established as soon as possible, his actions are no different from obstructing the establishment of the Trusteeship Council, just as the American representative Dulles said: "Although the Soviet Union is constantly complaining that the Trusteeship Council has not yet been established, its actions always hinder the establishment of the Trusteeship Council."</p>
<p>As for our country's attitude towards the trusteeship issue, our country's representative Liu 也 also made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, advocating the early establishment of the Trusteeship Council, and said: "We must not make the trusteeship system a 分 制, let alone make it a paper document; and we should make the tens of millions of people now get comfort, knowing that the United Nations organization is about to take steps to ensure their future progress and freedom." I remember that in January of this year, when the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting in London to discuss the trusteeship issue, our country's representative Dr. Gu Weijun clearly expressed our country's 本 立 塲 on this issue. He said: "The trusteeship system is a major advancement of the mandate system, and tens of millions of people will benefit from it. The trusteeship system may accelerate the political, economic, social, and educational development of the people in the mandated territories, so that they can establish autonomous governments and fulfill their aspirations for independence and autonomy, so that they can be realized as soon as possible." Therefore, we deeply hope that the Trusteeship Council can be established as soon as possible, and we hope that the politicians and diplomats of all countries can be farsighted and abandon selfish and self-interested ideas. On the one hand, they should not use the trusteeship system to pursue the interests of one country; on the other hand, they should not obstruct it, making it impossible for the Trusteeship Council to be established, seeking only temporary pleasure, but should think more about the tens of millions of people, so that they can achieve the ultimate goal of autonomy and independence as soon as possible; at the same time, the colonial issue should no longer be a source of war.</p>

<h3>Bandits in Hongze Lake to be Eliminated; Zhejiang Province Schedules Winter Defense to Begin Next Month</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Hangzhou Thirteenth] The Zhejiang Provincial Government decided to implement winter defense from December 1st to the end of February next year. It has formulated a general plan and submitted it to the Security Command for detailed measures, which will be handled jointly with the Gendarmerie Regiment and the Police Bureau.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Huaiyin News] Hongze Lake, located in the middle of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, is of great importance to the water conservancy of the Huaibao area. This time, when the Communist army retreated, it decided to destroy the dikes and harm the people. Everything below Huaiyin has become a swamp, and the western border of Huaian is still a vast expanse of water. The disaster is severe, and the lake surface is vast, with bandits lurking. It has always been a place to hide dirt and harbor filth. Bandits take advantage of the dense reeds to hide large quantities of food, weapons, and ammunition, and seize the opportunity to cause trouble. It is a major concern for the two provinces. The government is now actively preparing to build net boats and arm itself for self-defense in order to permanently eliminate the bandit problem.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Zhehua News] The Chaoxian County Government, because bandits often appear in various villages and towns in the Zhe district, disturbing the neighborhood, specially dispatched Chen, the captain of the county self-defense team, and Ji Min, to lead the first squadron stationed in Zhe, and set off to clear and suppress the Donghuangshan area. On the 7th, the self-defense team reported that there were traces of bandits in Xiaofang Village, and immediately dispatched squad leader Wang to lead the soldiers of the squad as the vanguard and went straight to search. They opened fire with the bandits in the village. Squad leader Wang was immediately dispatched to lead the soldiers of the squad as the vanguard and went straight to search.

<h3>Jiangsu Province Second District Finance Review Meeting; Counties Report Difficulties; Director Dong Explains Response Policies</h3>

<h3>News Telegraph Items</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Reporters Telegraph Request to Reduce</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Hangzhou News] The colleagues of the Zhejiang Provincial Association of Out-of-Town Reporters, believing that the price of electricity has been adjusted this time, and the price of news telegrams has also increased tenfold, which has greatly affected news reporting, unanimously decided to telegraph to news colleagues across the country to respond to the request to the Ministry of Communications to readjust the price of news telegrams in order to maintain the development of the news industry. In addition to taxes, the rate of the field tax has increased by 51 percent, and the rate of public grain has increased by 15 percent. Moreover, there are all of the deed tax and 50 percent of the business tax, which is already fully generous. Therefore, the heads of various counties and cities should, according to the urgency of local needs, strive to carry out construction projects in order of priority. At about nine o'clock, the reports on the financial, tax, and treasury conditions of the counties began and stopped at twelve o'clock for rest. In the afternoon, the reports continued at two o'clock and ended at about four o'clock. The conference announced a fifteen-minute break. The reporter of this newspaper synthesized the contents of the reports from the eight counties, most of which stated that the budget revenue and expenditure could not be balanced, resulting in the fact that special taxes could not be stopped, such as in Wujiang County. This issue was raised to Gu Junnan, the section chief of the Finance Department, who said that the Finance Department would strictly stop such situations. At 4:30, the meeting continued, and Director Dong specifically gave a general explanation on the various difficult issues raised by the counties, which are described separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The problem of unbalanced budget revenue and expenditure should not exist in the second district of Jiangsu Province, where the essence of Jiangsu is concentrated. If it does, it is only a temporary phenomenon when there is not enough food available before the harvest. The Finance Department can pre-borrow in-kind land tax payments from the Ministry of Food to offset the loans. There are about 5 billion yuan, which will be divided equally among the counties and cities for emergency use. However, the preparation of the next year's budget must be based on income and expenditure, and under the principles of management, education, health, and development, the focus of work must be determined and a percentage must be set to achieve a balance.</p>
<p>(2) The issue of temporary fees for emergency payments, if there is accidentally a shortfall, can be borrowed from the treasury. The province will separately set the flexible scale of the reserve funds for the counties and cities. As for the expenses for suppressing bandits in Jiangnan, if they are within the range of 2 million to 4 million yuan, they can be used first and then reported to the province for approval.</p>
<p>(3) The issue of rural and township autonomy funds, in the past, there were no funds allocated for subsidies, resulting in local fundraising, which became one of the hardships of people's lives. Recently, the province has stipulated that 1% of the deed price should be attached to the deed tax as a supervision fee for rural towns, and 70% of this income should be transferred to the original rural town expenses, and the remaining 30% should be coordinated by the county to allocate funds to remote rural towns. Therefore, local apportionment is absolutely not allowed in the future. However, if there are necessary construction projects in the area, the expenses will be proposed and approved by the town people's representatives congress and included in the county budget, and then it will be temporarily allowed to raise funds.</p>
<p>(4) The issue of insufficient county and city office space will be coordinated and adjusted by the province.</p>
<p>(5) The issue of insufficient financial and tax personnel in counties and cities can be appropriately supplemented, but the total expenses should not exceed 15% of the tax revenue in principle.</p>
<p>(6) The county and city revenue offices should be closely linked to the land registry offices. People must first obtain a new deed when handling property registration before they can issue ownership certificates at the price. The meeting adjourned temporarily at six o'clock. On the fourteenth, the treasury system, public funds and properties, and the organization of township production will be reviewed all day.</p>
<h3>Military Vehicle Carrying Passengers Speeding; Overturns into a Ditch on the Side of the Road</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Ding News] At about 7:00 p.m. on the 11th of this month, a vehicle driven by Tian Rulin, the driver of the third platoon of the first company of the eleventh battalion of the Independent Automobile Corps of the Ministry of Communications, was traveling from Kunshan to Shanghai.

<h3>Farmers in Northern Jiangsu Voluntarily Return Fields; Transportation of Local Products to the South is Becoming More Prosperous</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Zhenjiang Thirteenth] It is reported that farmers in the recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu, who were allocated land when the Communist army occupied it, have recently voluntarily returned the fields to their original owners. There are such phenomena in Huaiyin, Huaian, Gaoyou, Baoying, and 化. According to those familiar with the agricultural situation, there are three motivations for these farmers to return the land: (1) Because a family of five tenant farmers in Northern Jiangsu cannot make a living unless they cultivate more than 30 acres of land. Now, relying on the results of violent coercion, each person can only be allocated at most two and a half acres, and they have to bear public grain taxes and miscellaneous taxes, which outweighs the gains and is not what they want. (2) Although there were a few landlords in Northern Jiangsu in the past who enslaved tenant farmers, most of the landlords and tenants were able to depend on each other for survival. (3) Tenant farmers fear retaliation from landlords and fear losing their cultivation rights. It is heard that when a tenant farmer surnamed Ma in Gaoyou City was rejected when he returned the field, some tenant farmers actually prostrated themselves on the ground and begged.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Zhenjiang Thirteenth] As Northern Jiangsu is gradually stabilized, the transportation between Jiangnan and Jiangbei is becoming more convenient. Recently, the source of rice, wheat, pigs, chickens, ducks, fish, and shrimp transported south from various places in Jiangbei is becoming more prosperous, the market in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang is active, and the price of food is more stable. The price of top-quality rice has fallen back to 42,000 yuan per stone. It is generally predicted that if Lianshu, Fengfu, and are settled, the goods will flow smoothly between Jiangnan and Jiangbei, and the Shanghai industry can also benefit from it.</p>
<h3>Banning Rickshaws; Zhejiang Social Affairs Department Formulates Measures</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Hangzhou News] Since the government decided to ban rickshaws, Zhejiang Province has repeatedly received orders to implement it effectively. It is learned that the Provincial Department of Social Affairs has formulated implementation measures, which will be implemented after being approved by the Provincial Government Committee. Since learning of this news, the rickshaw industry in this city, including cart merchants and rickshaw pullers, has been quite concerned. Most rickshaw pullers only aim to make a living and do not seem to think about the issue of humane transportation. The cart merchants are mostly　generals　enjoying　　　　　already　　　　.</p>
<h3>Wenling Prohibits Grain Exports</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Wenling News] The county government of this county, in view of the fact that the price of rice in the markets in the four villages is higher than before at this time when the new grain is on the market, has not decreased for several days. The reason is that coastal villages and towns are leaking exports by sea. This matter not only affects people's food, but also hinders military and 微 real, so it specially issued a notice to strictly prohibit the leakage of grain exports by sea.</p>

<p>[Our Changshu Dispatch] Bandits Tao Liansheng and Zhu Baokang (also known as Lu Shikang) from Dongxiang, who hid firearms and acted lawlessly, confessed without hesitation after being captured.  After approval, they were sentenced to death. On the afternoon of the 11th, the security team was ordered to escort them to Meili to unearth the hidden firearms. When they arrived at Zifangdun, it was getting dark.  The two bandits, upon learning that Zhu Kun had been executed by firing squad, became terrified and attempted to escape. Seeing this, the security team, bound by their duty, immediately opened fire, and the two bandits were shot dead on the spot. A detailed report was submitted to the county. [Our Hangzhou Dispatch] The Hangyong Railway, the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan section, although completed and opened to traffic shortly after construction, was suspended due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance.  To prevent its use by the enemy after they invaded and occupied the area, it was destroyed.  Recently, the Shaoxing County Council, seeking to restore transportation and promote local prosperity, urgently hoped for its early repair.  It submitted a special request to the county government to forward to the province and then the central government for approval.  It has now been learned that the Ministry of Communications has included the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan section of the Hangyong Railway in the 36th-year plan, with construction scheduled to begin next spring and traffic expected to resume in the summer.</p>
<h3>Doubts Regarding Cost of Living Index: Zhedong Second District Commissioner Believes Lowering the Weight of Higher-Priced Goods is Inappropriate</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxing Dispatch] The Second District Commissioner's Office received a report from the Wuxing County Government regarding the October cost-of-living index for workers, which, after review by various legal groups, was determined to be 5717 times the base. The Commissioner believes that the purpose of compiling the cost-of-living index for workers is to adjust their living standards. According to item 3 of the appendix to the "Methods for Compiling Workers' Living Index" promulgated by the province, "The weights in the weighted aggregate method refer to the actual monthly consumption of each item by the average worker's family." It is stated that the figures do not seem to meet the actual needs of workers' lives. For example, the listed seven dou of rice can meet the monthly needs of two large mouths, one medium mouth, and one small mouth, but three catties of pork and four eggs are considered too few. In particular, one foot of each of native unbleached cloth and white cloth is insufficient for making shoes and mending socks, let alone making clothes and quilts. Moreover, cloth, pork, eggs, and other items are all high-index goods. Lowering the weight of higher-priced goods seems inconsistent with the aim of improving workers' lives. A telegram has been sent to the Provincial Department of Social Affairs requesting verification before further instructions are issued.</p>
<h3>Haiyan Dredges Yong'an Lake</h3>
<p>[Haiyan Dispatch] Yong'an Lake (commonly known as North-South Lake) in Yong'an Township of this county serves as a reservoir for irrigating thousands of acres of farmland in Ganpu and Yong'an, making it extremely important for water conservation and agricultural production. However, due to prolonged neglect of dredging, it has gradually become silted and shallow. In years with low water, it often leads to drought disasters, significantly impacting people's livelihoods. Previously, Senator Song and others initiated a request to the Good Samaritan Relief Association for funds to dredge the lake. The county government prepared a plan and forwarded it to the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch Office. It has now been learned that it has been approved. The county government has dispatched personnel to conduct a survey, and construction will commence as soon as the surveying is completed.</p>
<h3>New Shanghai County Magistrate Assumed Office Yesterday</h3>

Former County Magistrate Xu sent representative Chen Zhizhong to handle the handover. Regarding internal personnel, except for Secretary Zhang and Finance Section Chief Shi, who have not yet arrived, the Education Section Chief is Niu Zhiyi, the Military Affairs Section Chief is Yang Jing, the Land Administration Section Chief is Feng Feihuang, the Food and Grain Section Chief is Chen Zhizhong, and the Police Officer is Li Yinshan.</p>

<p>Caozhen Residents Protest Discrimination</p>
<p>Our Caohejing Township in western Shanghai had public transportation facilities such as buses and telephones before the war. During the period of occupation, these were destroyed by the enemy. Since the victory, we have repeatedly appealed to the relevant authorities for reconstruction, but it has not been possible due to insufficient funding and lack of materials. In particular, the failure to restore bus services has caused the general public traveling between Shanghai and Caohejing to endure hardship. In July of this year, residents of this town jointly sent a letter to Xiang Sheng Transportation Company, requesting the extension of the existing Shanghai-Longhua bus route to Caohejing Town. The company agreed, allocating additional vehicles and increasing service. This has been convenient for the public for several months. Unexpectedly, starting on the 7th of this month, the company suddenly announced the suspension of the Shanghai-Caohejing route, because the Public Utilities Bureau wanted to charge the company 3/10 of their total revenue for road maintenance, plus some kind of fee of a certain percentage. The company's daily revenue is only two to three hundred thousand yuan, which needs to cover the costs of several vehicles and over a dozen staff members, resulting in very little profit. They are unable to pay the road maintenance fees. Unexpectedly, the Public Utilities Bureau considered the company to be "disregarding the law" and requested the police to force them to stop the service. As it stands, public works construction in our Caohejing Town has not been included in the budget, and all transportation, sanitation, and street lighting construction must be funded and managed locally. This measure against Xiang Sheng Company is too discriminatory against the residents of our town. We hope that the Public Utilities Bureau will immediately use its own vehicles to continue operating on this route, and not allow transportation to be cut off. The citizens would be fortunate, and society would be fortunate.</p>

<p>Can an Unlicensed Vehicle Speed Freely?</p>
<p>I am a worker who leaves early and returns late, and I have a bicycle. This morning at 6:30 AM, when I was traveling through Broadway and Zhaofeng Road, a six-wheeled khaki-colored jeep truck came speeding up from behind. The rear wheel of my bicycle was crushed beyond repair, and my foot was also injured. The truck sped away. I discovered that this jeep truck is parked at the Yangshupu Bridge every day, used to carry workers, and has no license plate. I wonder who allowed this vehicle to do business there. (Zhou Shengkui)</p>
<p>The Issue of Fixed-Term Deposits After the War</p>
<p>There was a fair court judgment for pre-war deposits to be repaid at 1,000 times the principal. However, for seven-year fixed-term small deposits made in November of the 28th year of the Republic (1939) after the war, the price of rice had already risen to 30 yuan per stone at that time. If calculated to today, it would be more than 2,000 times. The term expires this month, and I don't know how many times the loss can be compensated. When considering the repayment of the principal, I hope that the financial and judicial authorities will devise a fair and appropriate guarantee measure so that the hard-earned deposits of law-abiding people are not turned into nothing, causing too much loss. (Yang Xinshi)</p>
<h3>Reply to Mail</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Lou Xinde: Regarding your letter about the Chenxu branch tax collection office occupying your house for rent, we have received a reply from the Municipal Finance Bureau stating: "The office address of the Xucao branch tax collection office under this Bureau originally rented from Mr. Lou Xinde's single-story house at 1762-A Huashan Road, consisting of three rooms and one shed. Previously, in response to Mr. Lou's request, it was agreed that the property would be returned upon the expiration of the lease (September 30th). As the housing shortage in Shanghai is severe, it is difficult to find a house for the moment. In order to take into consideration the needs of both parties, the branch tax collection office has been ordered to temporarily vacate two rooms for Mr. Lou to take back for his own use, and the approval has been notified to all parties. Currently, the office only rents two rooms. The claim in the original letter that it is 'transferring part of the property for rent' is not true. This Bureau has already designated a municipal public property house for the use of the Xucao branch tax collection office. It is currently in the process of taking it over from the original tenant. Once it is recovered, the two single-story houses rented from Mr. Lou will naturally be returned in full." Reply to Mr. Liu Licheng: Regarding your letter pointing out that the Jingyuan New Village is covered in garbage, we have now received a reply from the Municipal Health Bureau stating: "The 8th Squadron of the Cleaning Corps has been ordered to investigate, and it has been reported that there is no accumulation of garbage in the village. However, the village's hired sweepers are not cleaning thoroughly enough. They have been instructed to work diligently in the future, otherwise they will be sent to the police for punishment." Respectfully reported.</p>
<p>An Appeal from Tenants on Wuzhou Road</p>
<p>We, the dozens of households on Wuzhou Road, are mostly old tenants from before the war. We have lived here for more than ten years. During the August 13th Incident, we were once refugees. Fortunately, when we returned home, the houses were still there. Although the walls were broken and dilapidated, we managed to solve our housing problem through our own repairs. Midway through, the landlord sold the property to the enemy, but we still retained the right to rent. Until the victory came, the property was taken over by the state. In order to enrich the national treasury, enemy and puppet properties were put up for auction. In order to auction off the properties, the residents have to be evicted, which leads to an inability to live in peace. In short, we have already experienced the suffering of being refugees and the oppression of the enemy. We hope that today, after the victory, we will not become homeless again due to the auction. We, this group, are waiting day and night, praying for the grace of the government. (A group of tenants on Wuzhou Road)</p>

<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Reach Agreement: Trieste Issue Deadlock Broken: Direct Negotiations Between Italy and Yugoslavia Allowed, Conditional on Not Contradicting the Resolutions of the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 13th] The Four Foreign Ministers' meeting yesterday reached an agreement on the most thorny issue of Trieste, clarifying the political direction. The deadlock was broken due to a compromise attitude on the part of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. It is reported that the Four Foreign Ministers received a memorandum from Italy at the meeting. French representative Mauvais drew the attention of the foreign ministers to the importance of the Italian memorandum at the meeting. After lengthy discussions, three points were decided: (1) The decisions of the Paris Peace Conference regarding the Free Territory of Trieste, its central area, and its status shall be maintained. (2) The Foreign Ministers' meeting welcomes any agreement that can be reached through direct negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia, provided that this agreement does not violate the resolutions of the Paris Peace Conference. (3) Starting from the 13th of this month, the Four Foreign Ministers' meeting will discuss the French plan for Trieste point by point.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 13th] The Four Great Powers' Foreign Ministers decided last night to use France's draft proposal as a starting point when discussing the Trieste plan. The Four Foreign Ministers will discuss the plan item by item today. The main points are Articles 5, 6, 7, and 8. All of these articles have been passed by a two-thirds majority at the Paris Peace Conference. The provisions concern the powers of the Governor of the Free Territory. Article 6 stipulates that the Governor may recommend legislation related to the responsibility of the UN Security Council within the Free Territory, and the Governor may veto legislation that violates this responsibility. Article 7 authorizes the Governor to submit opinions to the meetings of the Trieste Government Commission. Article 8 stipulates that the Governor has the power to control public order and security in the Free Territory, handle diplomatic affairs, and appoint or remove judicial officials. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated yesterday that Article 7 could be accepted without modification, but Article 8 was completely unacceptable because the Governor's powers were too great and contradicted the spirit of democracy. Today, the economic experts of the Foreign Ministers' meeting began discussing the distribution of Italian reparations to countries other than the Soviet Union, the annexes to the treaties regarding insurance rights in the territory of former enemy countries, the annexes proposed by Britain regarding foreign oil rights in Romania, and the provisions for the recovery of property in the Finnish Peace Treaty.</p>
<h3>Italian Memorandum and Romanian Memo: Italian Foreign Minister to Visit Yugoslavia Next Week</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 12th] The Italian government today submitted another note to the Foreign Ministers' meeting, stating that the Italian government believes that the Foreign Ministers' decision to temporarily not review the Trieste resolution provides an indirect basis for the Italian government to seek a possible agreement with Yugoslavia. The Italian government believes that Marshal Tito's statement to Italian Communist leader Segregati is a positive factor in facilitating negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia. The Italian government is considering the possibility of direct negotiations with Yugoslavia, but any agreement reached between the two countries must be guaranteed by the UN.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 12th] Romanian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Vlas Nasovic, who arrived here yesterday, has submitted a memorandum to the Foreign Ministers' meeting, which is expected to include Romania's views on the draft peace treaty and Romania's demands on Germany.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 12th] Foreign Ministry sources said: Italian Foreign Minister Nenni will travel to Belgrade next weekend. "Italian News" reported that Nenni told Finance Minister and Communist member Scoccimarro that he was waiting for a formal proposal from Yugoslavia to hold direct negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia.</p>
<h3>Spanish and Palestinian Issues: Britain Seeks Solutions: Bevin Engaged in Diplomatic Activities in New York</h3>
<p>[Reported] San Francisco, 13th Radio: British Foreign Secretary Bevin intends to take advantage of the Four Great Powers' Foreign Ministers' gathering in New York to seek compromise solutions for the two major issues of Palestine and the Franco regime. It is heard that Bevin is considering asking the United Nations to urge Franco to hold a plebiscite supervised by international organizations to determine whether the Spanish people need Franco's dictatorship. If Franco were to win the plebiscite, it would undermine the demands of the Soviet Union and its allies to sever commercial and diplomatic relations with Spain. In addition, Bevin intends to discuss with Byrnes to reach an agreement on the Palestinian issue.</p>
<h3>US Expresses Disagreement with Severing Relations with Spain</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 12th] Regarding the proposal by representatives of Poland and Belarus that all member states of the United Nations should sever diplomatic and economic relations with Franco's Spain, informed sources in the United States said that the US delegation firmly opposes these proposals.</p>
<h3>Franco's Talk</h3>
<p>No Plans to Establish Commercial Relations with the Soviet Union: Overseas Interference Makes Elections Impossible</p>
<p>[Reported] San Francisco, 13th Radio: General Franco, in a separate response to questions from the Associated Press reporter today, said: Isolating Spain economically and politically will increase the possibility of war. Franco declared: Spain will not engage in commercial relations with the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union is determined to adopt an opposing attitude towards those unwilling to submit to it. While overseas interference is taking place, inciting internal rebellion in Spain, elections cannot be held. He also said: Spain will not request to join UN organizations until the animosity caused by war in the world disappears, at which point it can be considered.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Legal Committee Approves Drug Treaty</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 13th] The UN General Assembly Legal Committee approved an international drug control treaty today to replace the League of Nations' drug convention. The treaty was previously passed by the Social Committee. The Legal Committee approved the removal of Franco's Spanish regime from the treaty.</p>
<h3>Nehru's Birthday Today: Indians in New York Host Grand Banquet</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, New York, 12th] This month's 14th is Nehru's birthday. The Indian Free Nation Committee will hold a grand banquet here at that time, inviting representatives of the United Nations to attend and offer congratulations. Gu Weijun will also be present.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong International Drug Trafficker to be Tried in Los Angeles</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] The Treasury Department announced today that Linville, a major international criminal formerly engaged in the sale of narcotics in Hong Kong, was captured in Phoenix, Arizona, today and will be extradited to Los Angeles, California, for trial. According to investigators, Linville trafficked in Mexican opium and previously smuggled opium with others in Hong Kong. He ostensibly posed as a "righteous auction house owner," but in fact, he has been engaged in illegal activities for 30 years.</p>
<h3>Churchill Delivers Speech: Criticizes Soviet Control of Europe: Reaffirms Proposal to Establish United States of Europe</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] Former British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons today after King George VI read the speech from the throne, emphasizing that the international situation is bleak. He stated that the world situation has not improved. He recalled that when the general election was held last year, people believed that the Labor government would be able to maintain a particularly friendly relationship with the Soviet Union. Unexpectedly, relations between Britain and the Soviet Union are deteriorating day by day. British and American troops stationed in Europe have been gradually reduced, while the Soviet Union's troops stationed in Europe still maintain their strong strength, and more than half of them are still in wartime formation, which is worthy of attention. More than one-third of Europe is now under Soviet control, and the Soviet Union's western border has reached the Elbe River. It is difficult to predict the future fate of France at this time. As for the United Nations, its achievements are far fewer than we expected, but the opposition party still consistently supports the Labor government. Foreign Minister Bevin has done everything in his power, and the opposition party has also made every effort to support Foreign Minister Bevin. Regarding the United States of Europe, I still advocate that it must be organized, and I emphasize that the unity of Europe is the cornerstone of the world organization and the UN, and the principle of establishing a world organization. As for the German people's opposition to the Allied occupation and their grievances, we sincerely hope that the German people can all make a living and handle their own affairs.</p>
<p>Government's Indecision on Handling Palestine Leads to Errors</p>
<p>Regarding the Palestinian issue, I believe that the government lacks a clear policy, which has led to the misfortune of Palestine. If we cannot implement the promises we have made to the Zionist movement, then we should immediately transfer the mandate to the UN. If the UN can accept our proposal, then the burden on our shoulders can be lifted and shared by all countries. If the United States does not agree with this step, then it should assist us with manpower and money. We want to abandon India and fight the Jews in order to give Palestine to the Arabs. This is extremely contradictory. In addition, the opposition party is requesting that Parliament discuss the Indian issue before Christmas.</p>
<h3>Attlee's Reply: Not to Gamble with National Security</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] After Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons today attacking the government, current Prime Minister Attlee immediately replied, reiterating the statement he made last year that "there is no question of unilaterally abandoning imperial preferences." He also said that Churchill's criticism of the Palestine issue is regrettable. Although there are many difficulties ahead regarding this issue, we are not making mistakes due to indecision. As the mandated power, we must take into account the positions of both Arabs and Jews, and we will sincerely strive to obtain the cooperation of the United States. Regarding Britain's current position, it has become more vulnerable to attack due to the development of modern warfare. We are not a part of Europe, and once war breaks out, we will have no room to breathe. Therefore, we must train reserves so that in the event of war, we do not need to undergo six months of training before we can fight. Unilateral disarmament cannot give us security. If we want to achieve security, we must establish order throughout the world. Our progress is not as fast as expected, because we cannot gamble with national security.</p>
<h3>British Conscription Plan</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Announced in the House of Commons</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that, under the government's new plan, the period of conscription for men at the end of 1948 will be one and a half years. It is hoped that this period can be shortened in the future. After the expiration of the term, they will enter a reserve period of several years. The main point is that the reservists must be people who have received full training.</p>
<h3>US Import Preferences: Export Trade Will Decrease: President Martin of the Export-Import Bank Said</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 12th] President Martin of the US Export-Import Bank said that unless a policy of preferential imports is adopted, it will be difficult for US export trade to maintain its current situation. In fact, if the United States does not loan money to foreign countries, some countries will not be able to pay any debts owed to the United States. These countries have no goods to export and will not be able to continue buying goods from the United States.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 12th] US Undersecretary of State Clayton recently announced that the United States may conduct negotiations with 18 countries to discuss reducing tariffs. Republican Congressman Knudsen, chairman of the US House Budget Committee, declared yesterday that the Republican Party will carefully study any commercial agreements that the United States may sign with foreign countries in the future. As for the commercial agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Sweden, it has already caused dissatisfaction in the United States. Whether this agreement violates the principles of multilateral trade agreements will be decided by the new Congress.</p>
<h3>Iranian Coup: Plot Exposed</h3>
<p>[Reported] London, 13th Radio: A plot by the opposition to occupy the Iranian capital, Tehran, has been exposed. The government has ordered the arrest of those attempting to undermine national security.</p>
<h3>US Navy to Reorganize Starting on New Year's Day: Number of Ships Will Not Decrease, Aim is to Save Money: Organization System of Various Ocean Fleets Has Been Decided</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] The Navy Department announced today that the active-duty Navy will be reorganized starting on January 1 next year. One operational fleet will be stationed in each of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and the current fleet organization will be abolished. It is reported that the Third and Fifth Fleets will be disbanded. The purpose of the reorganization is not to reduce the number of warships, but to save money. The organization of the newly formed Pacific and Atlantic Fleets is as follows:</p>
<p>(Pacific Fleet) Commander-in-Chief Admiral Nimitz; the Western Pacific Fleet commanded by Admiral Cooke will report directly to him. This includes the China coast and land forces. Japan: The forces commanded by Vice Admiral Griffin will report directly to MacArthur, including the occupying forces in Japan.</p>
<p>(Atlantic Fleet) Commander-in-Chief Admiral Michel; the European Fleet and Mediterranean Fleet commanded by Admiral Connolly will report directly to him. Germany: The forces commanded by Rear Admiral Schuhman will report directly to McNarney, commander of the US occupying forces in Germany, including the occupying forces in Germany. Ships not in service will serve as reserve fleets for both oceans.</p>
<h3>US Navy Organizes Antarctic Expedition</h3>
<p>To Conduct Various Scientific Studies</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] The US Navy Department announced today that the famous Arctic explorer Rear Admiral Byrd will lead a naval expedition of 12 ships and 4,000 crew members to the Southern Ocean early next month to study the impact of the harsh climate on naval personnel and equipment, and to supplement and develop the results of Byrd's 1939 Antarctic expedition.</p>
<h3>Danube River Detains Ships; U.S. Orders Return to Various Nations</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 12th dispatch] Secretary of State Byrnes announced yesterday: The U.S. occupying authorities have been ordered to return 450 Danube River ships in the U.S., German, and Austrian occupied zones to the Balkan countries. This directive was issued after the U.S. discussed Hungarian reparations at the Foreign Ministers Conference a few days ago. Previously, the U.S. had detained these ships to obtain an international agreement to open the Danube River to all riparian nations. The Paris Conference decided by a two-thirds majority that the peace treaties with countries like Poland and Hungary should explicitly stipulate free navigation on the Danube River and, within six months after the treaties come into effect, convene a conference of relevant countries to establish a permanent new international regime for the Danube River. This decision was recently considered at the Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<h3>French Parliament Scheduled to Convene; Current Cabinet Decides to Resign</h3>
<p>Communists' Victory Deals Blow to De Gaulle</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 13th Broadcast: The Bidault cabinet has decided to resign when the new parliament convenes on November 26, as a result of the Communist Party's victory in the upper house elections last Sunday.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 12th dispatch] Regarding the victory of the Communist Party in the recent French general election, the National Front newspaper in Toulouse commented: The Communist Party's victory in France is a major blow to General de Gaulle, causing his prestige to plummet. From now on, the Communist Party will once again be the largest political party in France. In the first general election held in France on October 21, 1945, the Communist Party and its allies gained an advantage, winning 152 seats.</p>
<h3>Japanese Armistice Terms to China: Desire to Station Troops in North China for 25 Years; Proposed to U.S. Before the Pacific War</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 13th dispatch] The Far East International Military Tribunal continued today with prosecutors presenting various evidence, revealing the inside story of Japanese political circles from October 1941, when Konoe and Tojo had conflicting views, until the collapse of the Konoe cabinet and the rise of Tojo.</p>
<p>Documents Presented by the International Military Tribunal</p>
<p>(1) Kido's diary of October 16 records Konoe submitting his resignation to the Emperor, stating: "There is still hope for the Japan-U.S. negotiations to succeed. Regarding the troop withdrawal issue, which is considered the biggest obstacle, if we abandon the name and take the substance, there is still hope for compromise. Therefore, plunging into a major war is difficult for me, Fumimaro, but Army Minister Tojo insists on starting the war, so I cannot fulfill my responsibility as a minister." (2) Tojo's confession: Question: Before and after the collapse of the Konoe cabinet, did you feel it was necessary to declare war on the United States and the other three countries? Answer: I felt there was a danger of losing the opportunity to start the war. Question: Regarding the delivery of the final ultimatum to the United States, did cabinet members have differing opinions? Answer: The opinion was unanimous that it should be delivered to the U.S. before the attack. The timing of the delivery was decided by the Chief of Staff and the Chief of Naval Operations. Question: But the declaration of war was issued eleven hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, do you deny that? Answer: I do not deny it. (3) Togo's instruction to Ambassador Nomura in the U.S. on November 4: Present Japan's final proposal to the U.S., which is to acknowledge equality of trade, and Japan has no intention of expanding its right of self-defense under the Tripartite Pact. Regarding the troop withdrawal issue, "After the establishment of peace between China and Japan, troops will be withdrawn from all areas except North China, Inner Mongolia, and Hainan Island within two months. Troops will be stationed in the above three areas for 25 years, and troops will be withdrawn from Vietnam when peace is achieved." (4) Nomura and Kurusu's telegram to Tokyo on November 27: Negotiations have little hope of success. The President has sent a telegram to the Emperor, and unless the Emperor replies, the deadlock cannot be broken. Once the negotiations break down, war with the U.S. and Britain cannot be avoided. (5) The U.S. intercepted an international phone call between Kurusu and Yamamoto, the director of the American Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, on November 27.</p>
<p>Japanese Telephone Code Words Were Numerous</p>
<p>Yamamoto said: "How is the marriage going? (How are the Japan-U.S. negotiations going?)" Kurusu: "Haven't you received the telegram yet? It was sent out at 7 o'clock, and it's no different from what Miss Plum (Secretary of State Hull) said yesterday." Then they discussed the issue of Japanese troops entering Vietnam. Kurusu: "For a while, the marriage seemed likely to succeed (an agreement seemed possible)." Kurusu: "How are you? Is the child about to be born? (Is the crisis approaching?)". Yamaki: "It's about to be born." Kurusu asked in surprise: "From which side?" Suddenly realizing there was something wrong with the words, he quickly said: "Is it a boy or a girl?" Yamamoto said with a smile: "It seems like a very strong boy has been born. Has there been a statement to Miss Gentleman (President Roosevelt) today?" Kurusu: "No." Yamamoto: "The matter from the day before yesterday has not yet been decided, but it is very difficult to implement. Regarding the wedding ceremony, please don't interrupt (please continue negotiations)." Kurusu: "I'll do my best. But it's impossible to come back empty-handed. The other party still hopes to continue talking about marriage, but isn't the roadside excited about the imminent delivery? And Tokugawa (the Army) can't hold back anymore?" Yamamoto: "In short, the mountain cannot be sold (there can be no concessions)."</p>
<h3>Japanese Reparations Conference to Be Held in U.S. Early Next Month</h3>
<p>Everything Proceeding According to Plan</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th dispatch] Edwin Pauley, special commissioner for the investigation of Japanese reparations issues, declared today: The United States has now decided to begin resolving the distribution of Japanese reparations early next month, even if the Soviet Union does not participate. The United States has invited the relevant countries to hold a conference in Washington in early December, and all countries requesting reparations, except the Soviet Union, have expressed their acceptance. If the Soviet Union still does not agree at that time, we will proceed according to the planned approach. The United States is now eager to begin transferring Japanese factories to the countries requesting reparations, especially the Philippines, whose request for Japanese factories is valued at over US$10,000. Although Korea does not have the right to make a request, it may be able to receive a portion from the U.S.'s share. When a reporter asked whether the Soviet Union's delay in agreeing was due to the Japanese factories it took from the three eastern provinces of China, Pauley replied: This is one of the reasons. The Soviet Union does not want to include the issue of the factories in the three eastern provinces on the agenda.</p>
<h3>Former President of the Japanese Minseito Party, Chuji Machida, Passes Away</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 13th dispatch] Former President of the Japanese Minseito Party, Chuji Machida, passed away today at the age of 83.</p>
<h3>U.S. and India to Establish Embassies</h3>

Therefore, the Indian Representative-General to the U.S., Bal Behari, will remain in Washington as Chargé d'Affaires of the Indian Embassy until the Indian interim government appoints a new ambassador. U.S. Commissioner to India Merrell will also serve as Chargé d'Affaires of the U.S. Embassy in India.</p>
<h3>Progress in Indonesian-Dutch Negotiations; Agreement Basis Reached</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 13th Broadcast: The Dutch and Indonesian delegations declared today that they have reached a basis of agreement and have drafted a plan containing 17 clauses, stipulating that the Netherlands and Indonesia jointly administer Indonesia for two years. The draft can be signed in a few days.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative Accuses Japanese Diet Members; Acheson Demands Evidence; U.S. and Soviet Union Engage in Heated Debate Again at the Allied Council for Japan</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Tokyo, 13th dispatch] At today's meeting of the Allied Council for Japan, Soviet representative Derevyanko expressed dissatisfaction with the current Japanese government and accused seventeen members of the Japanese Diet, saying that these people participated in the Taisei Yokusankai, which was presided over by Tojo, and their notorious deeds were obvious, and they should be dismissed in accordance with MacArthur's purge order issued in January of this year. Derevyanko even refused to let go of the current Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida. It is said that Yoshida recently gathered several Japanese publishers at his official residence to discuss subsidizing the publication of a biography written by a writer about the late Duke Konoe. This writer previously engaged in pro-aggression writings, and the publishers are on the list of those to be purged. What is Yoshida's intention in colluding with them? This is the first time the Soviet Union has directly attacked Japanese politicians. The chairman of the Council, U.S. representative Acheson, rose to defend and demanded that Derevyanko provide evidence, saying: "We encourage Japan to adopt democracy, and it is better to democratize our actions first. The Soviet representative's views may differ greatly from those of others, but he must realize that without concrete facts, no one can be condemned. The establishment of the Far East International Military Tribunal is based on this principle, and the Soviet Union is also listed as one of the judges. Therefore, if it is said that these Diet members were previously members of a certain group and are suddenly dismissed, the reason is insufficient and concrete evidence should be presented." Derevyanko replied: These Diet members are not only members of pro-aggression groups, but also leaders of these groups, and according to the purge order, they should be dismissed immediately. At this point, Derevyanko read out several sections of the original order to prove his point. Chinese representative General Zhu Shuming seemed to agree with the Soviet Union's view, saying that Japanese officials and Diet members who were carelessly screened in the past should be re-screened, but he stated that it was only an opinion. British and American representatives stated that the occupation police have always been cautious in purging the Japanese. After the meeting, one of the accused Diet members, Jiyuto's Aizawa, told reporters: "The Soviet representative played the role of a Japanese Communist Party spokesman this morning. I have always been attacked by the Communist Party. The mastermind behind the Japanese Communist Party is the Soviet Union, and this is now clear."</p>

<h3>Yuan Lvdeng's Case to Be Retried This Afternoon; Li Ze Must Also Be Retried; Supreme Court Deems Three-Year Sentence for Li to Be Inappropriate; Evidence Unfavorable to Defendant Not Shown to Defendant After Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The case of Yuan Lvdeng, suspected of being a traitor, was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the Shanghai High Court. Yuan refused to accept the judgment and filed a petition with the Supreme Court for retrial through his lawyer, which was approved and remanded for retrial a few days ago. The High Court is scheduled to open the trial this morning for interrogation.</p>
<p>In addition, the case of Xue Jianqiu, a translator for the Japanese spy agency in Zhuji, is also scheduled to open this morning for the second trial.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The case of Li Ze, general manager of Sincere Company, suspected of being a traitor, was previously sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the Shanghai High Court. The Supreme Court now considers the original judgment to be inappropriate and has remanded the case for retrial. The judgment was sent to the Shanghai High Court a few days ago and notified to the defendant himself in prison. The main reason is: Regarding the evidence unfavorable to the defendant presented by the informant, the judge did not show it to the defendant or give the defendant an opportunity to defend himself after the investigation. It is reported that Li Ze was jointly accused by employees of his company, such as Shu Yueqiao, after the victory, accusing Li of providing Water Tint Iron to the enemy and serving as a director of the puppet Chamber of Commerce. After the Shanghai High Court concluded the trial and sentenced Li to three years of imprisonment, the defendant refused to accept the judgment and filed a petition with the Supreme Court for retrial through his lawyer. The informant's side believed that the sentence was too light and had appealed to all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Ding Bochu's Case Remanded for Retrial; Acquittal Makes Him Overjoyed</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Ding Bochu, the former chief of Cao Xing Township in the puppet Shanghai County, was previously sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the Shanghai High Court. After reviewing the original trial documents, the Supreme Court, based on Interpretation No. 3101 of the Judicial Yuan, believes that the defendant's tenure in the puppet government was only a service, and there was no collusion with the enemy to conspire to resist the country. It should not constitute a crime of being a traitor, and the original trial was inappropriate, so it was remanded for retrial. The case was to be retried by the High Court. The defendant claimed that he was appointed as the chief of the township by the government in 1939. Until the enemy and puppet government cleared the countryside in 1942, the original county chief fled, and he was forced by the puppet government to continue to serve as the chief of the township, but there was no act of colluding with the enemy to the detriment of the country. The designated lawyer Zhang Riping defended him. The High Court acquitted the defendant yesterday morning. Ding was overjoyed at the judgment and bowed to the court to thank them repeatedly.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhenchuan, Xie Guangming, and Others to Be Sentenced on the 20th</h3>

The defendant only admitted to serving as a puppet plainclothes police chief, and all other items were fabricated by others when filling out his resume. (2) Lu Jiaji, director of the South District Office of the puppet Central Reserve Bank's Shanghai Branch, claimed: He graduated from the Department of Commerce of Peking China University and served as the manager of the Baotou Branch of the Bank of Communications, the assistant manager of the Tianjin Branch, and the chief auditor of the Continental Industrial Public News Agency. Due to unemployment, he joined the puppet Central Reserve Bank in June 1942 to maintain his family's livelihood. The office only handled remittance business. He was accused this time due to a housing dispute. After the interrogation, the defendant was still released on his original bail.</p>
<p>Chen Mingde was accused of serving as a staff member of the puppet Ministry of Interior, the puppet National Government of Jiangsu, the puppet National Government of Jiangsu Province Youth National Director, the secretary of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government Affairs Office, the personal secretary of Chen Qun, and the secretary of the puppet Examination Yuan with the rank of senior appointment from the end of 1939. The defendant only admitted that he had served as a staff member of the puppet Ministry of Interior for four months, and then came to Shanghai to do business. (4) Wang Xianzong was accused of colluding with the enemy and selling drugs. After the above cases were interrogated, they were all postponed for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Clears Past Debts; Transfers Surplus to Expand Shipping; Xu Xueyu Inspected Wharves Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has recently been actively rectifying the atmosphere and order of the wharves and warehouses in order to eradicate bad habits such as stealing goods and extorting tips. Yesterday afternoon, Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the company, personally inspected the wharves. Xu stated that he would ruthlessly crack down on those contractors and supervisors who monopolized, manipulated, and divided profits on the spot, and many have been dismissed recently. He has also reached cooperation with the privately-run shipping industry, and these illegal foremen will not be hired. Xu also talked to reporters yesterday about the general situation of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, saying: The company had previously been burdened with huge foreign debts, but after a year of hard work, they have all been repaid. Therefore, the current income, in addition to covering expenses and costs, is now focused on expanding shipping. Not long ago, the company ordered three giant ships of more than 5,000 tons from Canada, named "Zi Zhong," "Deng Yu," and "Lin Ge." Among them, "Zi Zhong" was received in mid-October, and "Deng Yu" recently transported mobile houses to China and has now gone to Beijing. It will be officially received after returning to Shanghai.

<h3>U.S. Seamen Have Not Yet Returned to Work; No Ships to Shanghai in the Short Term; French Ship Songdan Completed Repairs</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The U.S. Pacific seamen's strike has not yet been resolved. According to the two major U.S. shipping agencies in this city, American President Lines and Foyle Company, due to the impact of the strike, ships from the U.S. to China cannot depart as scheduled, so the number of U.S. ships arriving in Shanghai is gradually decreasing, and there may be no ships arriving in Shanghai in two weeks. That is, the ships previously berthed in Shanghai are now only leaving and not coming. American President Lines has only four or five ships, and Foyle Company has only two, which will be successively exported. In addition, the Singapore dockworkers' strike has lasted for more than a week and there is no definite news of a resolution. However, two British ships managed by Butterfield &amp; Swire, the Glenapp, and Jardine Matheson's Teithowaig (transliteration) will arrive in Shanghai.

<h3>Municipal Conference Passes Adjustment of Freight Rates for Civil Ships and Coal Ships</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Civil Ship Commercial Guild and the Coal Ship Industry Guild submitted petitions for adjustment due to the fact that the freight rates set by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau in May of this year differed greatly from reality, but they were rejected by the bureau. The guild, unable to bear the losses, submitted petitions again on September 12 and 14, requesting an increase of 100% in accordance with the freight rates approved in May. The Public Utilities Bureau reviewed it in detail based on cost calculation standards and found that the income and expenditure offset each other by less than 60%. In September of this year, the workers in the industry went on strike due to the rising cost of living and the failure to request an increase in wages. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, the shipowners subsidized the workers with half a month's wages for September before resuming work. Now, the guild and others claim that since the freight rates have not been approved for adjustment, they are unable to continue to bear this subsidy, and a strike may occur again in the short term. They specially sent representatives to the Public Utilities Bureau on October 15 to petition for adjustment of the freight rates in order to prevent a riot. The guild's petition for adjustment of freight rates has been passed by the Municipal Conference, and it has been decided to adjust the freight rates in accordance with the original standards and current material costs.</p>

<h3>Suppressing Usury, Central Bank Reduces Deposit Reserve Ratio</h3>
<p>The economic downturn in various industries in this city seems to have reached a serious stage. The main reason is the coercion of usury.

Now the Central Bank is willing to reduce the deposit reserve ratio of the banking industry from 20% to 15%, and it is expected that the banking industry itself can obtain more than 10 billion yuan of turnover.

<p>It is heard that the company is currently planning to open a trans-Pacific Sino-US airline. Before the end of the year, it will order two Stratocruiser passenger planes worth US$1.5 million from the American Douglas Aircraft Company to realize the above-mentioned plan for a new trans-Pacific airline. This type of giant passenger plane is divided into two floors and has a sleeper and a sitting room, and the equipment is very luxurious. When flying at an altitude of 20,000 feet, there are also temperature adjustment and oxygen supply equipment. This plan is currently being actively planned. Once the Longhua Airport runway is completed, the realization date will not be far away. As for the rumor that the Longhua Airport is not enough and is requesting the authorities to borrow the Jiangwan Airport, when asked of the company's staff, it is said that there is no such intention.</p>
<h3>Four Employees of the China Textile Sixth Wool Textile Factory Embezzled Materials, The Incident Was Leaked and They Were Arrested and Confessed, Today They Will Be Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for Legal Action</h3>
<p>Bao Kuiwu, the representative of the Sixth Wool Textile Factory of China Textile Company on Linqing Road, secretly reported to the Yangshupu Branch in charge on October 30 that the factory employees Zhu Jijiao, Fan Yongwan, Li Meixian, and Zhang Yufeng were suspected of embezzling the factory's materials. The second share of the week immediately sent people to the dormitory at 156, Lane 217, Huasheng Road to arrest Fan Yongtao. Two boxes of white and yellow soap were seized in his home. Li Meixian (43 years old, Hunan native) was arrested at 449, Baofangfang, Laobazi Road. Two boxes of white and yellow soap and one box of Jixiang soap were seized in his home. Zhu Jiwen (37 years old, Anhui native, living at 68, Lane 645, Zhongzheng Middle Road) felt guilty when he heard the news. On the morning of May 5, he transported 329 pounds of white wool yarn, 394 pounds of gray wool paper, 608 pounds of green velvet thread, two boxes of white and yellow soap, and one box of Jixiang soap to the branch to ask for investigation. On the 6th, he went to 19 Yuqingli, Fengshou Road to arrest Zhang Yufeng (48 years old, Anhui native), and seized one box of white and yellow soap and two boxes of Jixiang soap. As of now, all the stolen goods have been recovered. It turned out that the Sixth Factory of China Textile Company had been ordered to be returned and managed by Chen. Zhu Li Ji Zhang and four others were originally employees of the factory. Taking this opportunity, they intended to embezzle the warehouse materials. They conspired with Zhu Xiangxing, Tan Jiaxiang, Yang Xin, and others who were at large. On October 18, Zhu and Tan, who were at large, rented a truck from the Huaye Transportation Company on North Chengdu Road and loaded 20 boxes of white and yellow soap and 26 boxes of steel wire circles, and delivered them to the stack room of Zhu's relatives in the Peifu Factory at 78 Mazili Road. Among them, the steel wire was originally noted on the transfer list to be transferred to Shanghai No. 17 Textile Factory of Jin Textile Company, so on the 29th, Zhu arranged for the steel wire to be delivered to the factory. All the soap was transported to the homes of Zhu, Fan, Li, Zhang, and Tan Jiaxiang, who was at large. Other colored wool threads totaling 8,331 pounds were loaded by Zhu Jiwen on the 23rd and transported to the warehouse of the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. at 47 Beijing Road to be temporarily stored by his friend Xu Naichen. On November 1, Zhu Weiwen transported it to his home. Unexpectedly, the incident was not secret and was learned by the factory. The factory sent a representative to the bureau to report the secret. After interrogation, the above four people were indeed suspected of embezzlement. It is decided to transfer them to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action today.</p>
<h3>The Telephone Company's 17-Story New Building, The Location Is Being Surveyed, According to the Regulations of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, It Must Be Built on the Bund</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the Shanghai Municipal Council approved the proposal of the American MGM Company to build a first-class cinema in Shanghai, Mayor Wu once told reporters that part of the reason for the approval was to stimulate the city's construction industry. Since the victory, the city has not yet had such a large building project started. If the MGM cinema is completed, it will definitely give the city's construction industry a big stimulus. Yesterday, Director Wang of the Construction Department of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works told reporters that since the restoration, there has indeed not been a large-scale building project in this city. Only the American Shanghai Telephone Company has registered with the Bureau of Public Works. The company plans to build a new building because the original office on Jiangxi Road is not enough. There are four possible locations for construction: (1) the corner of Jiangxi Road and Hankou Road, that is, the open space opposite the current Municipal Government Building, (2) the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Hankou Road, on the lawn behind the current Red Church, (3) the office of the Executive Yuan on Fuzhou Road, (4) the Bund of Sima Road, the current office of the State-run China Merchants Bureau. The telephone company is currently considering it.</p>
<p>According to the opinion of the Bureau of Public Works, the location of the new house is best at the current site of the China Merchants Bureau, because it is close to the beach, so the height of the house can be unrestricted. However, the telephone company intends to choose the open space opposite the current municipal government building at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Hankou Road, because it is all open space, and the current municipal government uses it as a parking lot, so construction can be started immediately after the decision is made, while the other three locations will have to wait for the demolition of the original buildings on the ground. However, according to the principle of new house construction of the Bureau of Public Works, the height of any building shall not exceed one and a half times the width of the road surface. Because the telephone company needs to build a 17-story building due to business needs, it must be built on the Bund. The person in charge of the telephone company is actively discussing with the Bureau of Public Works, and a final decision must be made in the middle of next week.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the Construction Department of the Bureau of Public Works: After the victory last year, from September to December, the bureau issued only 76 business licenses, while from January to the end of October this year, it has reached more than 700, and the number of applications for construction licenses to the bureau is increasing every month. Among them, the number of city houses accounts for the majority, with more than 270 houses, followed by residences, with more than 220 buildings, and then warehouses and factories. In addition, there are 7 theaters, 10 schools, and apartments, bathhouses, teahouses, restaurants, and other numbers.</p>
<h3>The Financial Revenue and Expenditure of This City in November Are Insufficient</h3>

In addition, the Finance Bureau recently borrowed 3 billion from the Municipal Bank for the regular expenses of various institutions under the city's jurisdiction in November. It is said that it will be distributed starting on the 16th.</p>

<h3>Girlfriend Is Too Bad, Sisters Are Induced to Become Prostitutes</h3>
<p>Ding Yuying (18 years old), a girl from Wuxi, and her sister Liying (17 years old) have been workers in the Sanxin Cloth Factory in Wuxi. On the 5th of this month, they met their girlfriend Zhou Meiying on the way, and they exchanged greetings. Zhou claimed that she had recently returned to Wuxi from Shanghai and said how prosperous Shanghai was and how the income from working was higher than in Wuxi, and invited the sisters to come and play. Wang Ying and others were moved and followed Zhou Meiying to Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 6th, Zhou led the Yuying sisters to 52 Rongchouli, Guizhou Road, and talked with a woman for a long time, and then left in a hurry. Since Zhou left, the woman has been monitoring the Yuying sisters very closely. In the evening, she said to the Yuying sisters that this place is a brothel set up by her husband Wei Genquan, and they have been sold for a price. From now on, they should obey orders. From tomorrow night, they will follow her to solicit customers on the road. If they object, they will be whipped without mercy. When Yuying and others heard this, they knew that they had been sold by Zhou Meiying. They pretended to be happy and planned to wait for an opportunity to escape. On the evening of the 7th, the woman's surveillance was slightly relaxed. Yuying thought that the opportunity had come, so she secretly told her sister to wait at the North Station. Yuying sneaked out to the North Station and reported to the police at the station. The Jinghu Railway Administration Police Team, Xihu Police Section, Third Sub-Section, prepared a document to transfer Wang Ying to the Lao Zha Branch. The second share immediately sent the shareholder Feng Xiushan to 52 Rongshouli, Guizhou Road. At that time, Wei Genquan had already fled after hearing the news. Only his wife Wei Xu and Ding Liying were taken to the bureau. After questioning, Wei Xu was suspected of forcing Liang to become a prostitute and will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action today. The two victims have been notified to their families to come to Shanghai to claim them. Zhou Meiying, who abducted and sold the population, is currently being investigated.</p>

<h3>Six German War Crime Suspects, Including Shen Ke, Acquitted by U.S. Military Tribunal; Still Detained Due to Case Involvement with the United Nations; Trials of Other Major Criminals to Continue</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After months of trial by the U.S. Military Tribunal involving twenty-seven suspected war criminals of the Ausland Organization (AO), six individuals, namely Shen Ke, Grisch, Wotto, Hohlmann, Stohrer, and Landau, were unexpectedly acquitted yesterday. However, Chief Prosecutor O'Connor immediately announced that these six would remain in U.S. military custody, as China, the United Kingdom, or other Allied nations may also prosecute them. Furthermore, they are all at least members of Nazi organizations, and should perhaps be returned to Germany for further interrogation.</p>
<p>The U.S. Military Tribunal sought to adjudicate only actions committed by the defendants after the German surrender in August 1945 that were detrimental to the United States. The prosecution accused these six of being spies for the Nazi Far East intelligence agency, the Ausland Organization (AO), who, after the German surrender, continued to engage in military activities harmful to the United States, providing the Japanese military and intelligence agencies with various forms of assistance, including intelligence, propaganda, and supplies, thereby undermining Germany's unconditional surrender.</p>
<p>Shen Ke was accused of being a "Number One Spy" specially trained by the German High Command, having been active in Chongqing and coastal cities of China. Not long ago, Randall, the manager of the United Press office in China, was sued by Shen Ke in our local court for exposing Shen Ke's espionage activities. Randall was acquitted, and Shen Ke's appeal to the High Court was also rejected.</p>
<p>Grisch, the leader of the German community in Guangzhou, was accused of collecting intelligence on the activities of the United States and its Allied nations' sea, land, and air forces and providing it to the Japanese military.</p>
<p>Wotto, the leader of the Nazi organization in South China, was accused of the same crimes as Grisch.</p>
<p>Hohlmann, the ambassador to the puppet government, was identified in the indictment as the superior of the Ausland Organization (AO).</p>
<p>Stohrer, the head of the Shanghai office of the puppet embassy, was also accused of being a superior of the Ausland Organization (AO). Landau was the consul of the puppet government in Shanghai, accused of being a direct superior of the Ausland Organization (AO).</p>
<p>The acquittal of the six was the result of a request by the defendants' defense lawyers to release all twenty-seven defendants. The defense lawyers raised three points of protest: (1) the terms of the German surrender do not apply to the defendants; (2) the charges in the indictment do not demonstrate that the defendants undermined the German surrender; and (3) the evidence provided by the prosecution is insufficient.</p>
<p>The court rejected the first point, stating that the German surrender was an unconditional surrender, not limited to the military, but applicable to any German national. The acquittal of Grisch and the other five was based on the remaining two protests. The trial of the Ausland Organization (AO) and the remaining defendants will continue, with the next hearing scheduled for 8:00 a.m. today.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Public Training Friendship Association; Wu Tiecheng Sends Special Congratulatory Message</h3>
<p>When the government organized national social military training in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the citizens of Shanghai, under the leadership of former Mayor Wu Tiecheng, established a Public Training Office. Trainees included managers and employees of banks and companies, shop owners and apprentices, factory workers, principals and students of universities and secondary schools, car drivers, rickshaw pullers, dock workers, monks, women, journalists, accountants, lawyers, and social celebrities, totaling over 25,000 people. During the War of Resistance, they participated in the Battle of Shanghai, maintaining a glorious history. After the victory, the trainees, to maintain their past spirit and to connect with each other, organized the Shanghai Public Training Alumni Association. The association held its inaugural meeting on the 11th of this month. Wu Tiecheng, unable to attend in Shanghai due to official duties, sent a special congratulatory message to show his encouragement. The full text is as follows: "Congratulatory Message for the Inaugural Meeting of the Shanghai Public Training Alumni Association. Wusong and Xupu, embracing the sea and bordering the river, the great eastern port, the rock of China, firmly defending our territory, thus preparing for war. Public training, its meaning profound, regardless of gentry or commerce, leaders from all walks of life, even common people, rising up to take arms, practicing martial arts in the training grounds. When the war against Japan began, our martial prowess was demonstrated, some participating in bloody battles, others rescuing the wounded. Persevering again and again, we finally hastened the enemy's demise. The glorious history is not forgotten by those in charge. Therefore, alumni gather here, in this assembly hall, to commemorate the dead, those who died for the country, to encourage the living, to unite and carry forward, some researching academics, advocating the Three Educations, others promoting public welfare, acting for national construction, benefiting people and things, truly planning for the good. The Yangtze River flows, the East Sea vast, for thousands of generations, preserving this glory. Respectfully congratulated by Wu Tiecheng of Zhongshan."</p>
<h3>Jing'an District Implements Police Sector System; Bureau Chief Xuan Personally Gives Instructions</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Police Bureau Chief Xuan, in order to implement the police sector system, started with a trial run at the Changshu Road Precinct. Since March, the results have been excellent. Bureau Chief Xuan ordered the Jing'an Temple District to implement the system as well, assigning 390 graduating police officers from the 4th Class of the Police Training School (including 20 female officers) to serve in the precinct. The original officers were transferred to the Taishan, Lao Zha, Huangpu, Xincheng, and Water Precincts. The new officers have all reported for duty, and after individual examinations by Precinct Chiefs Zhou Weiting and Wang Huachen, they have been assigned to work in the Foreign Affairs, Traffic, Criminal, and Registration Groups, commencing service the day before yesterday. It is reported that at approximately 8:00 a.m. yesterday, Bureau Chief Xuan personally went to the precinct to instruct all the officers, emphasizing three key points: (1) cultivate a new police spirit and improve police discipline; (2) hope that no criminal cases will occur after the implementation of the police sector system; and (3) eliminate the bad habits of the former patrol room and the enemy puppet era.</p>

<h3>Handicrafts Prepared for Export; Exhibition to Be Held First in Shanghai; Bank of China Provides Loan</h3>
<p>Chinese handicrafts are exquisite, delicate, and possess artistic value. The embroideries of Hunan, drawn work of Shantou, lacquerware of Fuzhou, Qingtian stones of Wenzhou, and silver filament curtains of Chengdu are particularly famous and renowned overseas. Before the Allied forces left China after the victory, they competed to purchase these items as gifts for relatives and friends. The China National Products United Corporation, recognizing that these products not only represent Chinese handicraft technology but are also primarily made by women in various regions as a side occupation, with relatively low costs, believes that active promotion would be beneficial to international trade. The company has now established the China Handicraft Products Company, dispatching personnel to collect products from various regions. Once gathered, a preview exhibition will be held in Shanghai, and after selection, the most exquisite items will be shipped to New York for another exhibition to obtain favorable prices. It is reported that the Bank of China, to encourage this export business, has approved a substantial loan to provide financial assistance.</p>
<h3>British Ship Flies International Code Flags; Passersby Mistake Them for Japanese Flag; Foreign Ministry Investigates Import of Japanese Ships</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 3:50 p.m., a gray transport ship of approximately 10,000 tons with a mast flying a rectangular red and white flag, each occupying half, and another triangular "adhesive plaster" flag below it, sailed past the Bund. Passersby stopped to watch, many mistaking it for a Japanese ship, and were surprised that the authorities would allow a ship flying the "adhesive plaster" flag to reappear on the Huangpu River. However, reporters learned from the Jianghai Customs that the red and white flag and the triangular "adhesive plaster" flag were international code flags, not a Japanese flag. The rectangular red and white flag replaced the letter "H," and the triangular "adhesive plaster" flag replaced the letter "I." The ship was a British transport ship that arrived yesterday afternoon and is now docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Regarding the import of Japanese ships, it has attracted the attention of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A telegram was sent to the Ministry's office in Shanghai for investigation. The director of the Shanghai office, Chen Guolian, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the results of the investigation. The text of the two telegrams is as follows: (1) Telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: "According to a phone call from the Chief of Staff of the Naval Headquarters, the Japanese ship 'Fourth Hinode Maru' is being detained at the Wusongkou, displaying Japanese pilot symbols but not flying the Japanese flag. Inquire whether it should be allowed to enter the port, the ship's mission in China, and its nationality, and whether permission has been obtained from the Allied Headquarters. Also, whether the import of such ships has been agreed upon with any aspect of our country. Please verify the truth with customs and other agencies and report the handling progress to the Ministry." (2) Telegram from Chen Guolian, Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs: "Regarding the arrival of the Japanese ship 'Fourth Hinode Maru' in Shanghai, received your Ministry's 28th dispatch of the 8th of this month. Inquired with the Naval Command, Commander Wei stated that the ship is a Japanese merchant ship piloted by Japanese personnel, permitted by General MacArthur's headquarters, transporting exchange materials for the Central Trust Bureau from Japan to Shanghai. This headquarters (Naval Command) has permitted it to enter the port."</p>
<h3>Salt Loan</h3>
<p>Total Exceeds Seventy Percent</p>
<p>The Shanghai area salt loan, led by the Bank of China and organized by a banking syndicate, is proceeding smoothly. The total amount of loans has exceeded 70% or more. In terms of transportation and sales, mortgaged and pawned goods total 1.2 million piculs, amounting to 13.2 billion yuan. Salt from Qingdao, Lianyungang, and Fujian is being transported to Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Henan provinces for sale. Loan negotiations are still underway for approximately 7 billion yuan. According to the banking syndicate, the total amount for transportation and sales loans is 16.8 billion yuan. Later, the [Illegible] Bureau, due to the need for salt in Henan Province [Illegible], requested an increase, specifying 100,000 piculs per month, with a three-month turnover, totaling 300,000 piculs, increasing the loan by 4 billion yuan, for a total of 20.8 billion yuan. As for production loans, originally set at 4.4 billion yuan, 1.4 billion yuan has been loaned to salt fields in Zhejiang, and 900 million yuan to Fujian. Currently, due to increased shipping costs, the salt price will soon be reported by the Salt Affairs Administration to the Four Joint Offices, which will adjust the loan amount according to current costs to the 70% mortgage value. (Previously, the market price of salt per picul was approximately 19,000 yuan, so the mortgage price was 13,000 yuan. Now the cost is 24,000 yuan, so there is a need to increase the mortgage value.) According to [Illegible] insiders, since the organization of the banking syndicate and unified management, there is a guaranteed supply in the sales areas, but it avoids overstocking. Therefore, salt merchants' business has become increasingly stable. Even if there are no excessive profits to be made, losses can be maintained, which is different from the past when salt merchants' loans were monopolized by powerful individuals, and small salt merchants could not obtain their share. It is also known that with the current low water level in the Yangtze River, large quantities of salt are concentrated around Hankou to meet the peak winter sales season. It is expected that the salt needs of the military and civilians this year can be assured.</p>
<h3>Question of Erroneous Strokes on Election Ballots; Ministry of Interior Interprets Liberally</h3>
<p>Chinese characters are complex. In election affairs in various regions, disputes often arise due to slight errors in the names of candidates written on election ballots. The Ministry of Interior's liberal interpretation of this issue has been issued to Shanghai, stating: "Any additions, subtractions, or misspellings in the strokes of characters that, based on the circumstances at the time, would not lead to misidentification as another name, should be considered valid." The Municipal Government has relayed this to all agencies and organizations for compliance, which should reduce election disputes in the future.</p>
<h3>New Armband for Military Police; To Be Worn Starting New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Regarding the Military Police Headquarters being reorganized into the General Headquarters of the Land, Sea, and Air Force Military Police on January 1 of next year, the reporter learned from the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police in this city that the order has not yet been received. However, the "armband" worn by the military police has been ordered to be redesigned for the winter uniforms this year, and will be used starting January 1 of next year. The armband's design is similar to the New Life Movement emblem, embroidered with the characters for "Military Police," and attached to the left shoulder. Military police serving at the National Assembly in Nanjing are already wearing it in advance. The armbands will be used uniformly across the country starting next year to standardize the appearance.</p>
<h3>Pier Construction in Nanshi; Dredging of Huangpu River Begins</h3>
<p>The Nanshi area, along Dongjiadu to Dongchang Road, originally had eighteen piers. Damaged by the Japanese during the war, only Piers 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 remain. The rest have been completely destroyed, and the Huangpu River has not been dredged for many years, causing siltation of the riverbed. Not only does the rebuilding of piers require dredging first, but even repairing the remaining ones necessitates dredging. The Public Works Bureau has decided to start dredging work from No. 1 to No. 4, with the consent of the Dredging Bureau. The Hailong vessel will be dispatched from Zhoujiadu in Pudong to begin work, estimated to take three weeks to complete, at a cost of approximately 200 million yuan. The funds will be drawn from the regular shipping berthing fees.</p>

She was formally married to Xu Meifang and had a miscarriage in October of this year. She knows nothing about Gu Yucai's death. Xu Meifang also denied jointly conspiring to strangle Gu Yucai. The prosecutor immediately ordered both defendants to be remanded in custody. Further evidence needs to be collected in this case for proper handling.</p>

<h3>U.S. Military Subpoenas Witness in Zhang Case; Refused Due to Lack of Official Documents</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The U.S. military authorities are about to begin the trial of the case of Zhang Da'erzi's tragic death. Yesterday, the U.S. Military Law Office dispatched 贝格特 Burgund to the District Prosecutor's Office to request the questioning of Spanish sailor 赖伦斯 who is in custody, as a witness.

<h3>First Batch of 56 Returned Overseas Chinese to Be Sent to Xiamen for Centralized Repatriation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office has approved the repatriation of the first batch of 56 returned overseas Chinese who registered for departure and rehabilitation. The repatriation procedures are currently being processed. As Shanghai is not a port of departure, the CNRRA Shanghai Branch has decided to send the group of overseas Chinese to Xiamen for centralized repatriation. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will then be responsible for repatriating them to their original places of residence. Considering the limited number of ships going to Southeast Asia, to ensure the timing of the voyages, the Shanghai Branch hopes that the group of overseas Chinese will report to the branch as soon as possible to be sent to Xiamen for centralized waiting and repatriation. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office has separately notified the registered returned overseas Chinese to collect their repatriation certificates promptly to facilitate early repatriation.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Medicine and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Roaring in Both Ears</p>
<p>Xu Fei asks: Several years ago, I suffered from a fever, and both eardrums suddenly ruptured, causing pus to be present in my ears and constant tinnitus. After being treated by a specialist with washing, ear drops, nasal drops, and air insufflation, and taking internal medicine, the pus in my ears has stopped flowing, but the tinnitus remains, causing me great pain. I read in the newspaper that physical therapy equipment (hearing aids) is effective for the above symptoms. Please advise.</p>
<p>[Reply by Dr. Gu Yuqi] Chronic otitis media requires long-term treatment by an ear specialist to be effective. Taking various vitamins internally can also help with treatment.</p>
<p>(2) White Spots on Both Eyes</p>
<p>Gu Zhaolian asks: My mother is 48 years old this year. She has always been very weak and has lung disease. Five years ago, she suffered from itchy corners of her eyes, dry nostrils, and tearing. Afterwards, red [Illegible] appeared in her eyes. Two small white dots, the size of half a grain of rice, were found inside the upper corner of the black cornea. After a few days, they merged and covered the entire cornea, leaving only a portion in front of the pupil, so she can still see slightly, but her vision is blurry when she squints. She was treated by a traditional Chinese medicine ophthalmologist, but it was ineffective. After a month, the red [Illegible] receded. The "white spot" on her black cornea has not receded. Unexpectedly, her right eye developed the same condition five days ago. What good method can cure my mother's illness?</p>
<p>[Reply by Dr. Gu Yuqi] She must be taken to an ophthalmologist for a detailed examination and treatment immediately. Each municipal hospital in this city has experts in charge of diagnosis.</p>
<p>(3) Joint Pain</p>
<p>Yuan Mingzhu asks: My friend's mother is 57 years old this year. In January of last year, she suddenly felt numbness in both knees, which gradually extended from her knees to the bones between her chest and back, as if bound by ropes. She experiences pain day and night, and her skin often feels hot. Any slight movement causes her entire body to be pulled and her breathing to be labored. For over a year now, she has been bedridden. Although she has taken bone pain relief tonics and blood-activating decoctions, and has been injected with 606, none of them have been effective. Please tell me the name of this disease and the treatment method. I would be eternally grateful if she could be cured.</p>
<p>[Reply by Dr. Gu Yuqi] The numbness and dysfunction in both knees may be related to high blood pressure and hardening of the blood vessels. She must be examined by an internal medicine specialist for detailed blood pressure, urine, and various brain-related symptoms to determine the correct medication.</p>

<h3>Oil Price Problem: Oil Rationing to Begin Next Week; Social Affairs Bureau to Convene Oil Price Meeting; Registration for Retailers Begins Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Due to a limited supply of cooking oil yesterday and insufficient oil allocation from private factories, merchants seized the opportunity to hoard. The market price of various cooking oils rose again. It is reported that the principles for oil rationing have been established. Starting next week, in addition to the National Food Oil Company and the China Vegetable Oil Factory each allocating 10,000 dan of cooking oil monthly directly to retail oil merchants, private factories will also allocate 12,000 dan of cooking oil monthly for rationing. Therefore, the city will have a regular supply of 32,000 dan of cooking oil monthly, which should stabilize oil prices. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau, seeing the resurgence of price hikes in the oil market, advised merchants not to hoard and refuse to sell. It is reported that merchants have complied and are selling their stocks. Therefore, oil prices should stabilize today. Furthermore, the Social Affairs Bureau, noting that current oil prices are slightly inconsistent with costs, will convene an oil price negotiation meeting at 2:00 PM on the 15th. Attendees will include representatives from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Oil Pressing Guild, the Oil Retailers' Guild, and the China Vegetable Oil Factory.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Retailers' Guild of Grain, Oil, and Oilseed Cakes in the city (i.e., the Oil Retailers' Guild) announces that, starting next week, 12,000 dan of oil monthly will be rationed from private factories. Registration for all oil retailers in the city will be conducted from today until the 16th, daily from 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Members should register. Non-members should complete both membership and registration procedures. The registration location is the guild's headquarters on the third floor of No. 37, Minguo Road.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Fall, U.S. Dollar Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Gold futures were weak yesterday, remaining generally stable, mostly in trading. The opening was 2.445 million, and after opening, although rising to 2.465 million, supply became available, and the bullish side retreated, knowing it would be difficult to win. Due to rationing, actual sales were quiet, falling to 2.422 million before stabilizing and rising slightly. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 200 bars at a price of 2.425 million, after which buying interest gradually increased. By noon, supply dried up again, and the price rebounded to 2.46 million. The initial morning rise then retreated. There were no special changes for next-day delivery, down 18,000 from before the close. Gold ornaments and plain silver also remained unchanged. Silver dollars rose slightly. Overnight interbank lending rates eased significantly, with interest rates falling to 11 to 14 percent.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies followed the gold market's fluctuations, initially flat then stable. U.S. dollars initially traded at 4,270 to 4,320 yuan, falling to around 4,250 yuan mid-day. New buyers entered the market at noon, driving the price back up to 4,270 yuan buying and 4,320 yuan selling, close to levels before the close. Hong Kong dollars initially weakened then recovered, ending 5 yuan lower than before the close. Hong Kong exchange rates were stable, with buying at 870 yuan and selling at 880 yuan. Indian exchange rates were 1,055 to 1,065 yuan. British exchange rates were 14,050 to 14,150 yuan. Trading volume was light in all currencies. The official U.S. dollar exchange rate remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks showed some stability yesterday in smaller issues, while larger issues were unable to maintain their strength. As a result, compared to before the close, Jardine Wovens, British American Tobacco, Jardine Matheson, and China Merchants Steam Navigation declined, while paper stocks rose slightly. Wheelock Marden and Shanghai Land Investment remained flat.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Stable</h3>
<p>Public bonds were stable yesterday due to a certain brokerage on the fifth floor absorbing bonds on behalf of Western merchants. Unified bonds saw varied activity from large investors but remained largely unchanged. Approximately 5 million yuan changed hands. Unified bonds opened at 1,450 yuan, gradually declining from 1,500 yuan to below 1,400 yuan before stabilizing, ultimately fluctuating between 1,420 and 1,450 yuan, resulting in a slight increase of 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. Categories A, B, and D rose 50 yuan, while Category E rose 90 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Sales Remain Stagnant</h3>
<p>Due to unfavorable export conditions, white tung oil has seen little trading for a long time. Domestic sales are also limited due to the restricted sales order, and the market is difficult to invigorate as new supplies are arriving. Since both domestic and foreign sales cannot be smooth, there's difficulty to stimulate the market. However, due to rising wages in various regions, the market appears tough despite the lack of sales, with tung oil's increase in relation to other goods still within strict limits. Recently, shipments from various places have increased gradually, and all channels are for storage in anticipation of sales, not immediate use. As for silk, without changes to the exchange rate, there's no development in exports. Considering the current market, improvement is difficult to expect, only stabilization is possible. Shanghai's foreign trade has been quiet for a long time. Domestic price of standard weight is 125,000 yuan, with very scattered sales. Tung oil sales in Hongjiang are not good, inventory is still high, winter sales are scarce, and development is expected only in the spring. The price for each barrel of various brands of western oil is 100,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Market Prices in Disarray Due to Shortage</h3>
<p>Since the United States banned exports, the supply of caustic soda in Shanghai has been dwindling, so prices have risen by more than one grade since February. The prices of American goods have also risen one or two times. Tianjin and Qingdao also have a large demand, requiring 3,000 to 4,000 barrels this week, and specifying American goods. As a result, prices for domestic caustic soda are lower than those for American goods. Holders of goods in Shanghai, feeling that it is not easy to find sources, are unwilling to sell easily. On Monday afternoon, the market price was 930,000 yuan per barrel of 300 kilograms, but there were not many transactions. Prices sold by merchants varied, but all were higher than the market. Yesterday, the market price was extremely chaotic, with some asking for 1.5 million yuan before being willing to sell.</p>
<h3>The "Delivery" Issue: Brokers Request Changes Regarding Margin and Guarantee Funds</h3>
<p>The Delivery Brokers' Association yesterday made a request to the Exchange, stating that the Exchange should only collect fees from one party for daily "Delivery" transactions that are settled. Also, guarantee funds should not be collected from brokers with balances less than 150 million yuan, and that only excess amounts should be paid according to regulations. The association stated that brokers have already paid 50 million yuan in guarantee funds, and the Exchange should not increase brokers' burden during this difficult time. It was also reported that brokers indicated that if the Exchange does not accept these requests, there may be a complete refusal to participate in "Delivery" transactions.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks: The Market Had Just Begun to Improve, But Was Again Dampened by the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks opened lower yesterday due to the uncertain situation and widespread speculation. After opening, Cantonese investors bought on the dips, creating an upward trend and even reaching high prices. However, large securities firms repeatedly sold at high prices, and banks also sold. After 10:00 AM, the market turned down, with wild fluctuations and a chaotic pattern. Generally, the market was not very strong as many bulls liquidated their positions before the close. Around noon, major players such as Taiwan floated many and No. 151 showed a desire to sell, intensifying the decline. Except for a few companies whose stocks repeatedly rose to their limit, Ying An once hit its limit. Lun He was stable despite the decline, but the others were all weak. Around noon, all stocks were trading at low prices. Compared to before the close, popular stocks such as Wing On, Silk, Jingfu, and New Kwong fell slightly, Meyer fell by half a percent, while Chin Hwa alone fell by 1.5 percent. Trust and Harmony rose slightly, while unpopular stocks such as Match fell by half a percent, Five Harmony fell by half a percent, Li An and New Shanghai also fell slightly by one percent, and the rest remained stable or declined slightly. In the afternoon, it was rumored that the Communist representatives had returned to Yan'an, and that brokers had made a request to the Exchange that if the Exchange did not accept their requests, all would refuse to participate in "Delivery" transactions. Many investors were hesitant, and selling increased, intensifying the bearish trend. Stocks continued to fall, becoming increasingly severe, making the market cautious. Chin Hwa and First Kwong fell to their limit, while Huo Ying and Wei Hwa rose. However, both soon stabilized. Near the close, all stocks traded in a chaotic pattern. Compared to before the close, popular stocks such as Wing On and Ts'ai Ho fell by one and a half percent, Meyer, Jingfu, and New Kwong each fell by about one percent, Dong Hing fell by one and a half percent. Among the unpopular stocks, Yung Kung rose by half a percent, China Textile, Tung Yih, New Asia, and Li An fell by one percent, Five Harmony, Underwear, and Match fell by one and a half percent, and the rest had slight adjustments. The total transaction volume for the day was 17.24 million shares, with very small increases and decreases in off-exchange trading.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Market Still Has a Black Market; Cotton Cloth Retail Activity Remains Flat</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the artificial silk market was still in a state of concealed speculation. 10-count and 16-count yarns could potentially be purchased at the controlled price. However, for yarns of 20 counts or higher, purchasing at the official price was practically impossible. Brokers had to buy at inflated prices. Common lightweight yarns such as 20-count Red Star and Gold City were priced around 2.05 to 2.06 million yuan, exceeding the controlled price by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan higher than on the 11th. Heavyweight yarns such as Special Double Horse were also trading at 2.28 million yuan, with very few transactions, as both buyers and sellers were wary.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market was flat. Broker demand had decreased, while local demand was slightly more active due to the colder weather. Transactions focused on dark-colored Shilin Yuan Bi Ji. However, supply was still sufficient, and prices remained largely unchanged, except for Shilin, which was slightly higher by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan due to the sharp increase in dye prices. There was more trading in bleached "Jumping Carp" cloth. Although the 12-pound fine cloth was out of stock in various factories, the cost of replenishing raw materials was lower because the yarn was rationed, so factories were willing to sell at the current price. As a result, there was no immediate upward trend. Dragon Head fine cloth was still trading at 83,000 yuan, while Bi Ji was priced at 94,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>U.S. Price Increases Likely to Cause Disputes Over Orders</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The recent cancellation of special price controls in the United States will have an impact on China's import and export industries. A reporter specially interviewed a person in charge of the industry. According to the discussion, after the United States cancelled special price controls, the trend of commodity prices in the United States will increase. As a result, some fixed transactions in the import and export industry will also suddenly change. Since the victory, import and export firms in Shanghai have sprung up like mushrooms, reaching more than 600 to date. Since most American manufacturers already have exclusive or specialized resident agents in China, these firms can only transact with foreign distributors or import and export firms. Ordinary transactions often rely on a single telegram to finalize. If prices rise after the order is placed, the supplier often delays delivery. If U.S. prices continue to rise in the future, similar situations will be more common. Some orders do not specify a price at the time of ordering and instead use the invoice price at the time of shipment. Therefore, importers today have no way to estimate the price of an order in advance. It is hoped that a trade dispute arbitration committee can be quickly established between China and the United States to fairly handle all trade disputes between China and the United States in order to resolve these delayed delivery disputes.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, December 12] Cotton trading was slightly more active today, with varying increases and decreases in far-month contracts. According to private sources, cotton farmers are still hoarding cotton, waiting for better prices. At the final close, the highest increase was 2.10 dollars per bale, and the lowest decrease was 5 cents. Also, [United Press] New Orleans, December 12, far-month cotton prices rose across the board today due to the impact of cotton fabric controls stimulating purchases. The closing price rose 5 cents to 2.50 dollars per bale.</p>
<h3>New Trends in Sugar</h3>
<p>The sugar market trend was stable yesterday. The association quoted a price of 138,500 yuan for existing medium-grade white sugar, 118,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan for raw sugar, and a small amount of new Huanggang sugar from the oil merchants had arrived, opening at 116,000 yuan. Old goods were at 110,000 yuan, Xinhua White at 123,000 yuan, and Xinhua Red at 120,000 yuan to 118,000 yuan. The Tianjin merchant started moving, hence the price increase, opening at 20, which was called at 110,000 yuan but not traded.</p>
<h3>No Significant Progress in the Tea Market</h3>
<p>In the Bingzhuang tea market, the sellers of Keemun new black tea were asking for around 7-8 million yuan per dan, which was difficult to sell. Therefore, Yingzhuang switched to selling Bailin new black tea and Keemun old black tea. As for the Chuzhen and Zhenmei green teas, the new goods were priced extremely high, and only a few export firms purchased them. It is reported that Yingzhuang has a high demand for Wenzhou new black tea and Tuzhuang fine black tea and is actively negotiating with the goods owners.</p>
<h3>Zhongxin Bureau's Allocation of Rayon: Black Market Trading Means Manufacturers Hurt Themselves</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A person in charge of the Government Property and Materials Management Committee, which is represented by the Central Trust Bureau (Zhongxin Bureau), said to reporters yesterday: Since the committee implemented 11 articles related to the allocation of rayon on the 17th of last month, the committee has been allocating rayon according to these measures. When allocations began last month, only half a month remained until the end of the month. The committee approved the allocation of approximately 70% of what each silk weaving factory applied for, totaling over 1,030 boxes. According to a reliable estimate, the actual monthly demand for rayon from silk weaving factories in Shanghai is approximately 2,500 boxes. Therefore, the total amount allocated this month is expected to be no less than that number. Also, if the second batch of Japanese rayon arrives, the committee may find a way to increase allocations. However, the committee has already reviewed and approved each factory's allocation amount based on its application amount and actual demand. The committee opens up rayon sales eight times a month, and each factory can open up to its approved allocation amount with the committee one or eight times. It has been learned that there have been several openings this month. However, some manufacturers made full purchases in one or two openings. Those manufacturers were selling rayon on the black market for profit due to the high prices and then reapplying to the committee. Since the committee had purchased enough, it could not reallocate. Those factories were then forced to repurchase from the black market, thus creating an opportunity for black market holders to raise prices. All of those manufacturers who sold for profit are eating their own words. Although the committee is allocating to various applying manufacturers, their actions are like spinning silk to bind themselves with. It is truly not knowing the value of favors. The committee has heard that they are closely watching factories reselling for profit and will be severely punished if necessary.</p>
<p>The Black Market Remained Keen Yesterday</p>
<p>Although the Central Trust Bureau continued to allocate rayon, black market prices continued to soar. This was because the allocation quantity was insufficient to meet factory needs, and despite wanting to calm the market, the market was actually even higher. Yesterday, the No. 120 Tianqiao old shipment had light, the morning was done to 750,000 yuan, to 612,000 yuan close, because there were actual sales households procurement, quite a transaction, resulting in more rebound, the old shipment actually shouted up to 900,000 yuan, the new shipment to 750,000 yuan, an increase of about 300,000 yuan compared to Monday. Other brands of semi-gloss rose by 200,000 yuan. Only the No. 150 glossy yarn had no demand, and the price was still the same as on Monday and did not open. The factory's price slightly changed yesterday. Products with slight defects, such as C-grade, were worth 3.6 million yuan. Ordinary high-end new goods on the market were priced at around 3.6 million yuan per load. Silk products did not change much yesterday, only the patterned feather yarn increased slightly by 50 yuan. However, raw material prices are still rising, and it is difficult for silk prices to maintain their original state.</p>
<h3>Sugar Price Review Committee Meeting; Medium Sugar Sells for 130,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau held its eighth Sugar Price Review Committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, deciding on five items: (1) The determined price of edible sugar is 130,000 yuan for medium-grade sugar and 110,000 yuan for raw sugar; (2) If there is a surplus of sugar purchase certificates in each district, they should be returned, and if there is a shortage, they should be reissued; (3) The standard weight of hemp bags is specified, and the Social Affairs Bureau, Civil Affairs Office, and Southern Goods Industry Association will jointly conduct on-site investigations to determine; (4) The issue of sugar rationing for households in rural areas such as Huajiang and Xinshijie is decided to be handled by the Civil Affairs Office and the Southern Goods Industry Association; (5) The next sugar allocation will be discussed at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Hongji Coal Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A large shipment of Hongji white coal arrived in Shanghai today, transported from Haiphong by Taikoo Company's Nanchang vessel, totaling more than 3,000 tons, arriving this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Arrives in a Rush, Sales are Sluggish; Oil Prices Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>Another 2,000 Bags of Hunan Rice Arrive</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 15,000 shi of rice arrived at the North and South River docks. Digestion was still sluggish. In fact, under the high interest rates, the factories and firms abandoned the original intentions of storing food. The purchasing power faded, and the market situation deteriorated. Northern japonica rice saw a sharp drop of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Southern japonica rice continued to fall by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Yangbu Indica also dropped by a small amount of 1,000 yuan. Indica rice also became sluggish with few transactions. White yuan and team yuan also fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean oil from the Fujian factory was slightly more active, and the market was strong. Soybean cake from Nanyang was slightly advanced, and the market rebounded by 200 to 300 yuan. The subsequent situation still depends on the digestion of various ports. Bran rebounded slightly by 100 to 200 yuan. Flour arrivals increased slightly, and the appetite was very light, falling by 300 to 400 yuan. Various factories distributed 300 dan of oil to the oil market, and the price remained the same. There were no transactions outside the market. Broad beans are in a stable trend. Red beans are good for high-quality goods, but medium-quality goods lack spirit, still in an escalating discount. Red sorghum rebounded slightly by 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame is scarce and strong. The Guangzhou gang has been buying groundnuts, continuing to rise by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Corn in Qingdao picked up.</p>
<p>In addition, a small amount of Hunan rice has arrived at the port. Yesterday, the Sanbei Company's Mingxing vessel transported more than 500 pieces of flue-cured tobacco and 2,000 bags of Hunan rice from Wuhan to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Compound Distribution Association Strictly Prevents False Reporting</h3>
<p>Set up a secret complaint box and welcome letters of举报 (jiǔ jǔbào) to report accusations. Set up an exchange, so that the same trade can barter each other.</p>
<p>Since the Auxiliary Products Cotton Yarn Distribution Association handled the distribution of yarn, the work was extremely tense, but because there were so many members of the trade, the manufacturing plant locations were scattered, and the situation was complex. It was inevitable that the declared production power and required quantity would be falsely reported, and in order to prevent this malpractice from arising, in addition to sending personnel to investigate separately, another announcement was made and a secret complaint box was placed at the gate of the association. Accusations were welcome, and the main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Anyone who discovers that a member of the trade is reporting inaccurate production machines and operating rates, reselling allocated cotton yarn for profit, or joining two guilds to fraudulently receive distributed yarn may report it to the association in secret.</p>
<p>(2) When making a secret report to the association, please provide a formal letter, sign and seal it, mark "Secret" on the envelope, and drop it into the secret complaint box.</p>
<p>(3) The Chairman of the Board will open the secret letter himself, and strict confidentiality will be maintained both internally and externally.</p>
<p>In addition, since the yarn allocated to each member of the trade could not be generally applied, which lead to the occurrence of return, the Auxiliary Products Cotton Yarn Distribution Association specially petitioned the Spinning Management Committee to establish a cotton yarn exchange. The detailed measures have already been approved, and the issue of staffing is still handled by a member of the association serving as an assistant. Letters have already been sent to each member of the trade to handle registration matters first. The exchange measures, prices, etc. will be handled in accordance with the Spinning Management Committee's approved handling, and this organization will handle the mutual exchange of affairs within the same trade completely. If there is any allocated yarn that cannot be applied, the Association will deliberate and trade to each other. The number of supports and price difference, then the funds will be subsidized and returned in accordance with the cotton yarn conversion method.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Timber: Foreign pine prices have increased due to rising prices in foreign producing areas, and sellers have mostly raised prices, but because the market sales are small, the increase is still small. Fir prices are still stable.</p>
<p>Hardware: Actual sales are not moving, the market is getting tired every day, and the customer base is watching and waiting. Business is extremely sluggish.</p>
<p>Red Dates: New red dates from Tianjin have been arriving in increasing numbers recently, totaling 6,000 to 7,000 bags, so the market is very soft. Good-quality dates of all grades were priced at 150,000 yuan, and black dates and walnuts were also very weak.</p>
<h3>Correction: Letter from Hae Nying Soeng</h3>
<p>In the November 10th issue of your newspaper, there was a news item entitled "Japanese White Newsprint Resold Through U.S. Hands," stating that Hae Nying Soeng has shipped a large quantity of Japanese white newsprint. Hae Nying Soeng is in the business of newsprint trading. Our company (Hae Nying Soeng Exclusive Export Trading Co., Ltd.) specializes in selling Canadian white newsprint and does not sell white newsprint from other sources. We hope you will make a correction.</p>
<h3>Cooperative Factory Coming to Fruition; Two Major Issues Awaiting Resolution: Organizational Structure and Profit-Sharing Methods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Shanghai Branch of the National Cooperative Marketing Administration, and the China Silk Company will hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss the organizational plan for the silk cooperative factory. Generally, the three agencies will cooperate and divide the work. The Social Affairs Bureau will be responsible for organization and supervision. The Marketing Administration will be responsible for the export of products; China Silk will contribute more in terms of funding and will advocate for allowing private investment from outside parties at the beginning of the factory's establishment to enrich its financial strength and make it easier to manage. It is heard that the above two agencies have approved this opinion. In the future, the machinery and assets of the four factories will be valued as official shares, and the workers will voluntarily subscribe to shares as private shares. As for management, some advocate that it should be based on the principles of the cooperative, with the members' congress as the highest authority. Others think that this method is inappropriate and advocate that the board of directors should be established in accordance with the general company organizational law. These two opinions can be decided at tomorrow's meeting. Also, the profit-sharing method of the factory will be a heated discussion at tomorrow's meeting. One view advocates that profits should be shared according to the size of the shares, but the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau firmly opposes this method, believing that the purpose of the cooperative factory is to give the workers the feeling of being the "master" and that their self-esteem and responsibility must be improved to eliminate labor unrest in an invisible way. The adoption of a common corporate system in management is an unavoidable measure; therefore, in profit-sharing, the spirit of the cooperative must be maintained so that workers can obtain the greatest benefit, otherwise the word "cooperation" will be nominal and the factory will still have labor disputes. As for the compensation for outside private investment, a portion can be specifically set aside from the profits, but the percentage of workers' red envelopes should be at least 40 percent. Relevant sources pointed out that if cooperative factories can be managed well, there are four major advantages: (1) Eliminating labor unrest altogether, (2) Establishing wage standards that can be used as a reference for other state-owned and private factories, making the current disputes over the cost of living index unnecessary. (3) Due to the workers' conscious efforts, production can be increased. (4) Workers are the masters of the factory and will not be exploited, and their standard of living can be improved.</p>

<h3>Second Day of Elementary School Sports Meet: Group Gymnastics Performance is Excellent; The Assembly Will Close This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the tenth All-City Elementary School Joint Sports Meet. The program focused on group gymnastics and track and field semi-finals and finals. Although the autumn wind suddenly picked up, the young heroes were still full of spirit. Mr. Gu Yuxiu, the chairman of the assembly and director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, made a special visit to the venue at 1:00 PM yesterday, which greatly inspired the athletes. Yesterday, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, the group gymnastics and various track and field preliminary semi-final and final matches were held separately. Each school participating in the group gymnastics displayed skilled and neat operations in front of more than 10,000 spectators. The Danish exercise of the Chunghua Elementary School was well received and praised by the judging panel as being beautiful. Others, such as the rice harvesting dance of the Feihong Elementary School, with the participation of the youngest and most childish little angels, was particularly commendable. The physical education queens of Weiyu Elementary School, with their brightly colored and gorgeous costumes and agile movements, the fitness exercises of Daozhong Girls' High School with musical accompaniment, and the cooperative efforts of Minzhi Elementary School, with little angels dressed as men, women, old people, and various animals, were particularly humorous and added luster to the assembly. The first item in yesterday's group gymnastics performance was the doll dance performed by the kindergarten students of the Fuchun Main School. Pairs of boys and girls, each holding a doll, slowly entered the arena amidst the melodious piano music, patted the dolls, circled the school flag, and walked in a circle, singing and dancing, with novel and unique materials, which were in line with educational ideals. The assembly is scheduled to close at 5 p.m. today.</p>

<h3>Renyu's Loss Last Night Was a Pity. Black and White Team's Victory Was Very Risky. Xiao Huatuo's Last Throw Brought Them Back to Life. The Result Was 38 to 37, a Difference of One Point.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Black and White team, another strong basketball team from the Filipino Chinese community, showed their skills for the first time last night. They played against the Renyu team at the City Gymnasium at 6:30 PM. The game was not very successful, and it was thanks to Xiao Huatuo's throw in the last minute that they turned defeat into victory. The situation was very critical. The final score was 38 to 37. In the first half, Renyu took a four-point lead with a score of 22 to 18. Renyu led all the way from beginning to end, but unfortunately, they could not maintain their lead in the end, which was a great pity.</p>
<p>Black and White's Performance Was Not Ideal</p>
<p>The match was not very exciting, showing dullness and relaxation. Black and White's performance did not reach its best. Apart from Xiao Huatuo and Guo Guoye, there were no outstanding performances. The connection of shots seemed to be inferior to the beauty of the group. When the situation was critical, there was no special tactic shown to rescue the situation. Fortunately, they relied on the last throw. Their invincibility was due to luck and fate. Renyu lost many opportunities, otherwise the situation would have been set. However, the first game cannot determine the merits. Black and White will show their true strength in tomorrow's game against Zheng Lun. There were more than a thousand spectators last night.</p>
<p>Renyu Led by One Point But Lost</p>
<p>When the whistle blew to start the game, Guo Guoye of Black and White broke the basket first, and Wang Huaiting immediately responded. Wu Chengzhang's shot put Renyu ahead. Guo's shot and free throw, plus Shen Renshou's icing on the cake, led 7 to 4. Xu Zhongji scored; Wang Huaiting scored twice, and Renyu led again 10 to 8. From then on, they led all the way. At the end of the first quarter, Renyu led 12 to 10. In the second half, the two teams played a seesaw game. At the end of the first half, the guest team was behind 18 to 22. After switching sides, Renyu's momentum was still strong. Black and White relied on Xiao Huatuo and Fu Yongxin to score, chasing to 30 to 31. Wu Chengzhang scored on a free throw. In the third quarter, Renyu led 32 to 30. In the last quarter, Guo Guoye of Black and White was disqualified for committing five fouls. Renyu led 37 to 31 by three goals. At this time, there were still five minutes left. Renyu's strategy was wrong, and Black and White scored five consecutive points, chasing to 36 to 37. In the last half minute, Xiao Huatuo shot from afar and broke the basket. The bell rang loudly, and Black and White narrowly defeated Renyu 38 to 37.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Promotes Youth and Student Health - Implements Physical Standard Tests - Starting This Month in Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] In order to promote the physical health of youth and students across the country and pay universal attention to sports, the Ministry of Education plans to implement physical standard tests for middle school students in provinces and cities across the country, so that the sports of youth and students in provinces and cities across the country can be universally developed. It is reported that it has been decided to start with Nanjing this November. The test items generally stipulate that a certain age must have a certain height and a certain weight as the standard physique, and middle school boys will be tested on running (a certain number of meters), jumping (running long jump), throwing (ball), and pull-ups (girls are exempt from the pull-up test). According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, there are 28 public and private secondary schools with 15,000 to 6,000 students. If they are tested by district and held during physical education classes in each school, it will take two to three months to complete the tests. If the tests are conducted collectively, the time can be shortened, but holidays must be used. The detailed measures will be implemented in Beijing as soon as the Ministry of Education approves them in the near future.</p>

<h3>Compensation Measures for Wartime Employees and Public Servants Abolished - New Measures Have Been Formulated and Implemented</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government recently received instructions from the Executive Yuan, which were relayed from the National Government, stating that the Examination Yuan had submitted a request from the Ministry of Personnel to abolish the compensation measures for wartime employees and public servants and to formulate a draft compensation measure for employees, which has been approved for implementation.

<h3>The Resurrection of a Dead City… Before and After the Recovery of Dongtai…</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Taixian Reporter, Ling Songshou</p>
<p>Dongtai News, 4th</p>
<p>According to the original plan of Commander Li Tianxia, Dongtai was to be recovered by the end of October; however, in reality, it happened four days earlier. This further increased his confidence in the "magic weapon" (planned operation map) he had in his pocket.</p>
<p>Originally, after the National Army recovered Liangduo on the 25th, the vanguard crossed Sanli'an, only thirteen li away from Dongtai City; and the left-wing troops inflicted a serious blow on the Communist army at Wushen Temple, the largest stronghold southwest of Dongtai City. It was known that the Communist army had no ability to continue resisting in Dongtai. The reason for their delay in retreating was only to prolong the time to strengthen their plundering and transportation efforts.</p>
<p>Doors Closed During the Day, Perfunctory Business at Night</p>
<p>On the 27th, the reporter was in Hai'an, and in the early morning, I was told by the head of the Army Affairs Office that Dongtai had been recovered. I immediately took a special car to Liangduo. The next morning, I followed the 83rd Division headquarters to Dongtai.</p>
<p>The suburbs of Dongtai City are much larger than Taixian. A single main street is a full seven li long. On the first day of arrival, the street seemed strangely deserted. Very few shops had their doors fully open, and looking at the shelves from the doorway, there were very few goods on them, some even empty, especially the silk and cloth shops. The reporter rested at an oil shop and talked with the people there. According to them, "Doing business under the Communist army's rule is not easy. They have cooperatives, and all business is subject to their control. They monopolize the good business, but if there's anything unprofitable, they immediately come to you. Clearly, the market price of beans is only 20,000 yuan per stone, but they insist on 25,000 yuan; while the oil that is pressed out is bought by them at a flat price, and they profit from reselling it." The oil shop owner asked me, "They say that merchants are an exploiting class; but what is this method of theirs towards merchants?" Because of the fluctuating "value" (?) of the "Anti-Currency," the people gradually became wary. For several months, most shops didn't want to do any business, preferring to close, but the Communist army wouldn't allow them to do so in order to promote the market. As the National Army advanced north from Hai'an, government planes frequently patrolled Dongtai, dropping leaflets. The shops used air raid precautions as an excuse, gladly keeping their doors closed during the day and doing business for only an hour or two in the evening, just to get by. Therefore, before its recovery, Dongtai had become a dead city; it only came back to life after the National Army moved in.</p>
<p>Traffic Gradually Resumes, Thousands of Returning Home Each Day</p>
<p>During the week that the reporter was in Dongtai, it was clear that Dongtai was moving towards recovery day by day. At least a thousand displaced people were returning home from other places every day; the water transport between Dongtai and Taixian had also resumed; batches of goods were being transported to Dongtai, replenishing the shelves of the shops and enriching the Dongtai market; hotels and restaurants that had not been operating during the Communist army's occupation were now reopening. The number of new shops opening and old shops reopening was increasing daily. Even shops that had not yet resumed business were either because the owners had fled and not returned, or because the goods ordered had not yet arrived; in the warm embrace of the government, they would still work hard to build a new Dongtai.</p>
<p>Due to the two major reasons of inconvenient transportation and lack of supplies, small stalls were very active on the streets of Dongtai. They mostly transported general retail goods from Nantong or Taixian for sale. The prices of various goods were initially very high, such as Morris cigarettes selling for 1,000 yuan a pack in Taizhou, but 1,800 yuan here. But in the last three days, as the goods gradually poured in, the average price was only about 20% higher than in Taixian. The prices of other daily necessities were assessed and implemented by the county chamber of commerce: rice at 32,000 yuan per stone, straw at 3,000 yuan per dan, pork at 1,600 yuan per catty, kerosene at 800 yuan per catty, vegetables at 30 yuan per catty, and plain boiled water at 10 yuan per bowl. The merchants and people were still able to understand the government's intentions and obeyed the orders. There was no excessive fluctuation within a week.</p>
<p>Not Hoarding "Anti-Currency," Not Waiting for it to Become Waste Paper</p>
<p>Speaking of the market, one naturally thinks of the currency problem. Not long ago, some people thought that the "Anti-Currency" left behind by the Communist army was a matter worth discussing. But based on the reporter's impressions from the recovered areas on the eastern front over the past ten days, it doesn't seem to be that serious of a matter. (Of course, this may only be the case on the eastern front; the situation in other places may be different.) The common people, oppressed by the Communist Party, had no choice but to use a currency other than the one stipulated by the government in their own country; however, they saw things very clearly. Despite the Communist Party's flowery rhetoric, they would never hoard a large amount of "Anti-Currency" at home, waiting for it to become waste paper. As for the shops, as mentioned earlier, they didn't want to do business at all. Even if they had accumulated "Anti-Currency," they had already burned it before the National Army moved in. One boss told the reporter, "As long as the National Army comes, what else matters? This small loss is better than being completely ruined by them (referring to the Communist army), isn't it?" Currently, the common difficulty in the market is the lack of legal tender. When the National Army first arrived in Dongtai, almost all transactions on the street were mainly conducted by the troops. There were hardly any transactions between Dongtai people and Dongtai people. The reporter once heard a housewife say, "I don't even have money to buy vegetables!" Although the current situation has improved a little, it is still far from being "flexible." Of course, there are various difficulties in promoting the bank, but we cannot simply watch the market of a newly recovered city become so rigid. The day before yesterday, I heard Commander Li say that if the legal tender problem cannot be solved, he is prepared to temporarily allocate some cash from the military supplies office to the county chamber of commerce for use. However, this is only an expedient measure. The main expectation is still the restoration of the banking sector.</p>
<p>Visiting Commissioner Zhang, Enquiring About Issues in the Recovered Area</p>
<p>The land problem in the recovered areas has also been discussed in the newspapers. Some advocated borrowing water to sail the boat, that is, using the recovered areas as a model to realize the initial equalization of land rights. Some advocated handling it gently, so that the people who had suffered great calamities could breathe a sigh of relief. The "Guidelines for Administration in the Pacification Zone" recently passed by the Supreme National Defense Council were formulated based on the latter. For this reason, the reporter specifically visited Commissioner Zhang of the Sixth Administrative Region to inquire about his opinion on the land problem. Commissioner Zhang believes that the above-mentioned system is very suitable for the customs and habits of the people in the recovered areas, and it truly reflects the government's care for the people's difficulties. The commissioner also believes that the land problem will not have major disputes in northern Jiangsu. First, Chinese folk customs have always been generous; especially after surviving a disaster, people sympathize with each other and will never engage in encroachment or impersonation. Second, the landlords will not have completely lost evidence of their right to the land; and northern Jiangsu is mostly composed of self-cultivating farmers, living in villages, with descendants replacing each other. The ownership of the land or its boundaries is not only very clear to the landlords, but also very clear to the neighbors. It is impossible to encroach or impersonate even if they want to.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the issue of revenge by the people, the reporter consulted relevant parties for their opinions. Everyone felt that according to the nature of Chinese people to be tolerant, there would not be any revenge actions against the small number of bad elements. However, in order to prevent problems before they occur, on the negative side, the local authorities should still carry out effective propaganda and earnest exhortations to ensure mutual understanding and no disputes; on the positive side, the government should quickly establish courts in the recovered areas so that fair resolutions can be sought when disputes arise.</p>
<h3>The Common People Say: The Dark Days are Over; The National Army Has Brought Warmth and Light</h3>
<p>The urban area of Dongtai City has not experienced major battles, so the surface damage is still small. However, after six years of oppression by the enemy and puppets, coupled with more than a year of trampling by the Communist army, we can easily imagine how Dongtai is now showing a strong exterior but weak interior. The destruction of the war, the reporter has passed through Fuan, Anfeng, Liangduo and other places many times. The disasters are everywhere, which is really unbearable. In the section from Qintong to Dongtai, such as the villages near Shinian and Wushen Temple, all were set on fire by the Communist army, and the residents were displaced. In addition, the Communist army also carried out large-scale killings. In the villages north of Qintong, there were more than 2,000 victims. All of this requires the government to launch relief work as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Following the entry of the National Army, the Dongtai Power Plant also resumed supplying power, which added a lot of vitality to Dongtai. The common people said: "The dark days are over. The National Army has brought us warmth and light!"</p>
<p>In order to prosper the market and stabilize the people's hearts, Commander Li is very concerned about the development of legitimate entertainment in the local area. He instructed the local administrative authorities to prepare for the establishment of theaters and cinemas, so that the people can taste a little bit of the flavor of peaceful times after the disaster. Commander Li is always so artistic and modern; on the battlefield, he cannot leave a movie camera. A few days ago, the commander invited the generals and reporters to watch the anti-Japanese war film "The Road"; on the chairman's birthday, the newsreel "Madame Chiang's Visit to the United States" was shown in public places, and the common people were all very happy. They said, "The National Army is still the National Army!" The new era drama troupe of the division headquarters, after performing "Nation Above All" and "Golden Earth" in Taixian, rushed to this coastal ancient city, ready to give a public performance of a certain drama to comfort the Dongtai people who had suffered so much.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Things Waiting to be Sorted Out, Expanding the Gains of Points and Lines</p>
<p>The recovery of Dongtai is only a gain of points and lines. At the beginning of the restoration of local administration, hundreds of things are waiting to be sorted out. Commissioner Zhang listed four major points to the reporter, namely: (1) consolidation of city defense works, (2) enrichment of local armed forces, (3) reorganization of Baojia households, and (4) strengthening of military-political cooperation. However, at the beginning of the administration, there is no shortage of economic needs. "Speaking of local finance, it is another headache." Dongtai County Magistrate Fei Jun frowned and said to the reporter: "Not to mention a myriad of things, it is not easy to collect donations and land taxes. Even if the agency is mature, please ask, in this chaos after a major war, when people are struggling to survive, is the government still embarrassed to reach out to the people for money? The provincial government subsidizes the reconstruction expenses for three months at 15 million yuan per month, but according to the current expenditure situation, the county government needs at least 60 million yuan per month. Where does it come from? Now we are trying to maintain it within the scope of credit. If we look one step ahead, it is really chilling."</p>
<p>This is a special feature. Almost all the party and government leaders and cadres in Dongtai are from northern Jiangsu. They serve the countryside, fought guerrillas during the Anti-Japanese War, became refugees after the victory, and are still working hard until recently when they were restored. The Commissioner's Office moved into Dongtai territory less than three days ago, and then moved again. However, after moving around, it is still a very cramped and dark old house. Commissioner Zhang smiled and said to the reporter, "We are still living a guerrilla life!"</p>
<p>Dongtai has been recovered! None of the people are not looking forward to governance. "A hungry person is easy to be fed, and a thirsty person is easy to be given a drink." The reporter believes that under the leadership of this group of hardworking officials in charge, Dongtai will easily restore its old appearance!</p>

<h3>"Traitor Bandits" and "Eighth Grandfathers": A Glimpse of the Front Line in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Stationed in Peiping, Song Shaobo</p>
<p>Air News, 4th</p>
<p>Now, in the intricate areas that neither the government nor the Communist Party's armed forces can fully control, you can see how sharp the struggle is. In these areas, all that is seen is the struggle for survival. The common people are dying in groups in this struggle. Because of the Communist Party's policies, "class struggle" can be clearly seen here. Those who call the Communist Party "traitor bandits" are those whose property has been "struggled" and "liquidated" by the Communist Party. These people have no choice but to leave their homes and move their families to cities or stations controlled by the government. They are the tens of thousands of "refugees" who have turned from rich to receiving relief. However, relief can only solve the problem of survival for a while, so in the end, they form so-called "armed homecoming teams," or join the police and security forces to earn money and find their enemies—"Communist cadre"—in their hometowns to take revenge. Whenever they see them, they rarely take them back. Most of them kill their enemies on the spot (or are killed by their enemies). They are afraid that if they take them back to the county, the enemies will escape death by chance. After killing people, they take all the food of the enemies, set fire to the houses of the enemies and their own houses, and return to the county town to prepare to come again. The Baojia chiefs have the right to arrest any suspicious person. The peaceful countryside has now turned into a killing field. In the past, the death of one person would spread throughout dozens of miles of villages, but now being killed is commonplace and not surprising! The Communist Party also has its masses. According to what the reporter Er Peisun heard from the Zhuoxian Party Department, those "paupers" call the Eighth Route Army "Eighth Grandfathers." When the Eighth Route Army arrives in villages they rarely visit, the poor quickly run to the street to greet them: "Eighth Grandfathers, is it our turn to celebrate the New Year this time?" Then, under the auspices of the Eighth Route Army, the food of the richer families is divided up. If you say no, it immediately becomes a problem, and some people end up losing their lives. However, the Eighth Route Army cannot stay there forever. After the Eighth Route Army leaves, another kind of retaliatory struggle follows. Secretary Xiao said: "Today, it is necessary for us to earnestly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. Verbal promises can only be used for a while. The second time, they will not work. We cannot solve the problem by relying solely on armed suppression." Local party and government workers are hoping that the government will have a comprehensive solution. At least the new policies in northern Jiangsu, eastern Hebei, and Chahar need to be considered comprehensively. Regarding the Communist Party's policies, according to a Catholic priest in Zhuoxian, they have become more active after the victory than before, so the opposition and vendettas in the countryside are much more severe than before. The traditional customs and habits of the countryside are changing, and the common people generally understand the struggle for survival.</p>
<p>Politics Cannot Keep Up with Military Affairs</p>
<p>Under the active activities of the Communist Party, the weakness of local politics is a matter that deserves serious consideration. Those who commanded the operations this time all lamented that politics could not keep up with military affairs. The aftermath work after the army passed through was mostly a mess. Without the cooperation of the regular army, the local armed forces could not hold on firmly, let alone expand. According to Cui Shichang, commissioner of the Sixth Administrative Region of Hebei Province, and Niu Bingxu, magistrate of Zhuoxian County, it is because the salaries of local workers are too low, so capable people do not go to the countryside or dare to go to the countryside. Under the restrictions of central laws, everything is restricted. Taking county-level salaries as an example, starting from April of this year, the province stipulates that each person's living allowance is 24,500 yuan, and the base salary is increased 77 times. The living allowance for police officers and servants is 14,700 yuan, and the base salary is only thirty or forty yuan. In terms of total income, a clerk with a monthly base salary of 100 yuan only earns 32,300 yuan, while a police officer only earns 14,700 yuan. It is not enough for one person to eat coarse grain, let alone support a family. Starting in July, the province stipulated to improve the treatment of public school personnel, allocate public grain, 80 catties of wheat per person, and increase the base salary by 160 times. Police officers were given 60 catties of wheat and increased base salary, and the living allowance was canceled and no arbitrary apportionment was allowed. As a result, after calculation, not only did it not increase, but it decreased by more than 10,000 yuan. The county police teams who have fled to other counties are even more miserable, earning less than eight or nine thousand yuan per month. If they are not allowed to find their own way, they cannot live. If they are allowed to find their own way, then only the common people will suffer. The abuses are unspeakable. Conversely, the Communist Party's county and village-level cadres not only have personal living security, but their families do not have to worry about life. Under the widespread "struggle," "liquidation," and "emancipation movement," the poor have become a new class with land and power. These people passively reduce the Communist Party's administrative concerns and actively become the Communist Party's pioneers. According to Xiao Peisun, he has not yet encountered a true Communist Party member who is willing to surrender after being captured. The government's local administrative personnel and police teams do not even have time to take care of themselves, so how can they be blamed for not fulfilling their duty to defend the territory? Therefore, of the ten counties under the jurisdiction of the Sixth Administrative Region today, Zhuoxian, Dingxing, Laishui, Xincheng, Guan, Yongqing, Shuangxian, Xinlu, Laiyang, and Yixian, the latter six are in the hands of the Communist Party, and the government only controls three or four tenths of the territory of the remaining four counties. After the years of war and the Communist army's capture of various places this time, the localities have suffered great damage, and there is no remaining strength to rebuild. If they are destroyed again, they will only perish together. However, the "face" matters still cannot be left undone, such as the Zhuoxian's "Long Live President Chiang" birthday celebration, which was to remove the original county-run central primary school sign and replace it with a new sign that said "Zhuoxian County-run Chung Cheng Elementary School."</p>
<p>The Commanders on the Front Line Have Not Forgotten Peace</p>
<p>But after the reporter returned from the front line, after careful thought, peace is still hopeful. Those commanders who commanded the operations are always concerned about the peace talks in Nanjing. The commanders standing on the front line call the rear every day to inquire about the news in the newspaper that day, and what they care most about is "How are the negotiations in Nanjing?" "Are we still going to fight?" Those young officers are not eager to talk about the civil war, but when they talk about how the Battle of Guilin was, they will very excitedly and patiently tell you about the situation of each battle. But they hate the Communist army's destructive behavior, believing that this can only eliminate the country's vitality.</p>
<p>The Communist Army Released Poison Gas at Beiyue Temple (Special Correspondent Hang Zhou)</p>
<h3>Heart of Jehol: A Bird's-Eye View of Chifeng</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for Northeastern Affairs, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>Shenyang Air Dispatch, October 30th</p>
<p>Chengde, the politically significant capital of Jehol, has long been officially recovered. Chifeng, the heart of Jehol, also entered the embrace of the National Army on Double Tenth Day, and Jehol is now on the right track. To see the actual situation in Chifeng and provide a truthful report, I, the reporter, accompanied General She Yuming on an inspection trip to Jehol on the morning of October 29th, and went to the airfield.</p>
<p>A twin-engine transport plane left Beiling Airfield at 10 a.m., first flying southwest, skimming over Jinzhou, then turning northwest, passing Chaoyang and Jianping, crossing the Lao Ha River, and entering the Chifeng Basin.</p>
<p>Chifeng is the heart of Jehol, and its urban area and population exceed those of its capital, Chengde. The "Yefeng" Road, built in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], started from Yebaishou and ended here. Unfortunately, this 147-kilometer-long railway was completely destroyed by the Communist army. The rails can still be pieced together, but the sleepers were used by the Communist army for construction and firewood, and some were scattered among the people, now almost all gone.</p>
<p>When the plane passed between Chaoyang and Jianping, the backs of the barren mountains were covered with a layer of thin snow, dazzling and stimulating, reminding us of the cold in Chifeng. This was fully reflected here. However, upon entering the Chifeng Basin, we felt the warm sunshine, not much different from Shenyang. However, it is said that Chifeng had a snowfall a few days ago, and the temperature once dropped to four degrees below zero.</p>
<p>The Red Mountains Stretch Out, Chifeng Gets Its Name From This</p>
<p>Looking down on the basin, the fields are crisscrossed. The city of Chifeng is located in the center of the basin. The plane gradually descends, and what comes into view is the reddish-brown, towering Red Mountain. At the foot of the Red Mountain, herds of sheep are moving, and in the fields, there are many men and women collecting stalks of grain. On the highways and small roads, villagers are carrying grain into the city to sell. Several small rivers flow through the east, north, and west sides of the city of Chifeng, surrounded by mountains and rivers, it can be said to be another paradise in the barren mountains.</p>
<p>Red Mountain is located in the southeast of the city of Chifeng, and "Chifeng" gets its name from this. The Mongols call it "Ulan Hada," which means "Red Mountain." "Chifeng" has no city wall. Now, the brothers of the 93rd Army stationed there, along with the local people, are jointly building an earthen wall around the city, measuring 24 li. Strongholds made of stacked stones have been built in key areas of the wall to prevent unexpected disturbances.</p>
<p>Communist Army Retreats, Banned Goods Reach Chifeng</p>
<p>The plane landed at the old airfield three or four li outside the city to the south, which is no longer in use. The pilot landed safely with skilled technique. Because no telegram was sent in advance, Army Commander Lu Junquan drove to meet us on the spur of the moment. As we drove through the streets, people knew that Director Du had arrived, and all showed sincere respect on their faces.</p>
<p>The streets and alleys are orderly, and people's clothing is also very simple and neat. There are very few extremely ragged and malnourished people. Most of the shops are open for business, but prices are constantly rising. It is said that there are two reasons for this: one is that merchants from the Jinzhou area arrive very quickly and purchase in large quantities; the other is that after the Communist army retreated to the northern part of Udan, they restricted the transportation of materials from their controlled areas to Chifeng.</p>
<p>Household Registration Shifts From Anxiety to Stability</p>
<p>Chifeng County Magistrate Sun Ming, because he arrived later than the army, has just begun to handle everything in the county, and all work is waiting to be actively carried out. The people of Chifeng have shifted from anxiety to the right track of stability. Now, the work of organizing the household registration in the recovered townships and districts is being promoted.</p>
<p>According to last year's statistics, the population of the entire county is 326,319. According to the latest survey, the population of Chifeng city is divided into 65 bao, 566 jia, 9,678 households, and 43,894 people, including 23,164 males and 20,730 females.</p>
<p>Schools have started. Chifeng Middle School has 212 students, and there are 10 elementary schools with 1,480 students. In addition, there is a national elementary school. The political department of the 93rd Army has made many efforts to launch the resumption of classes at all levels of schools. On the 12th of this month, all schools fully resumed classes under the call of the department.</p>
<p>National Army Stationed, Only Then Did People Know Who the Leader Was</p>
<p>Slogans such as "Long live Chairman Chiang!" and "Support Director Du to stabilize the new Jehol!" are written everywhere on the walls. According to the person in charge of the army's political department, "The people of Chifeng suffered greatly under the ravages of the enemy and puppets in the past. The Communist army stayed in Chifeng for more than a year. They only knew that in addition to the Communist Party, there was also the Kuomintang, but they did not know who the leader of the Kuomintang was. After our army was stationed here, we received a lot of praise for the National Army's prestige, and at the same time, we also learned about the Founding Father and Chairman Chiang."</p>
<p>County Magistrate Sun said, "When the National Army first entered, some people did not dare to come forward, or some had a hedging mentality, because the Communist army was still on the outskirts, fearing that they would come back to settle accounts with them. Later, the Communist army gradually moved away, and the nearest place was more than sixty li away. At the same time, after I announced the government's policy towards the people, the main point was that everyone would have freedom in the future. Those who were forced to join the Eighth Route Army and wanted to start anew would be treated leniently by the government and would not be held accountable for the past. We hope that those who were hidden by the Communist army can awaken and will never be allowed to disrupt public order. Only then did the people settle down and express their heartfelt conviction."</p>
<p>"There is also a matter that makes everyone feel uneasy, and that is that people who were liquidated by the Communist army in the past now want to carry out reverse liquidation. The county government told them that the Communist army had transported all the materials away, and there was no longer any reason to argue between the rich and the poor. We hope that everyone will cooperate sincerely and restore order together, because if this is not done, local public security cannot be quickly stabilized."</p>
<p>Mongol and Hui Compatriots Account for One-Tenth of the Population</p>
<p>Mongol and Hui compatriots account for a part of the total population of Jehol. The Mongols have a long history of activity here. It is estimated that the Mongols in Chifeng account for just over 10% of the total population of Chifeng city. In the past, the personnel of the Wangfu [Prince's Mansion] are now mostly in Yebaishou, and Chifeng has an "Ongniud Right Banner Office."</p>
<p>According to the pseudo-Manchukuo Yearbook: "In the northern part of the province, Han and Mongol people live together. Due to the different traditions and ideologies of the two ethnic groups, or economic conflicts caused by land rights and tribute relations, it is difficult to integrate them harmoniously. Therefore, in the same area where Han and Mongol people live, it is necessary to implement a banner system for Mongols. However, in September of the sixth year of Kangde [1939], the Mongolian princes voluntarily gave up their inherent privileges, and thus the dual administrative system of counties and banners, which had hindered the promotion of provincial administration for many years, was integrated into a unified system."</p>
<p>It is said that the Mongol compatriots here are now planning to form some kind of their own organization, which may repeat the chaos of the past county and banner system. The Hui compatriots account for more than 20% of the total population of the city, mostly as beef and mutton vendors or running small restaurants. It is said that in the past, because of cultural backwardness, they were easily instigated, and there were often frictions with the Han compatriots. In the future, if politics can get on the right track, of course, all problems can be solved.</p>
<p>Parts Taken Away, Restoration of Power Generation Still Awaits</p>
<p>In many border areas, the people are mostly tough. Also, because this is a tobacco-producing area, there are many drug addicts.</p>
<p>Chifeng's export products include fur, livestock, wheat, and sorghum, which are mostly transported to Jinzhou and Shenyang. The prices of general daily necessities are lower than in Shenyang. Pork is 60 yuan per catty in circulation coupons, beef is 50 yuan per catty, mutton is 55 yuan per catty, white flour is 50 yuan per catty, buckwheat is 25 yuan per catty, sorghum rice is 16 yuan per catty, millet is 15 yuan per catty, eggs are 10 yuan per catty, and a small box of Philip Morris cigarettes is 130 yuan.</p>
<p>There is a thermal power plant that supplies more than 7,000 households with electricity. When the Communist army left, they took away small machines and scattered parts, so that power generation cannot be restored yet. The telecommunications bureau also encountered the same fate, thus creating Chifeng's dark and stagnant phenomenon.</p>
<p>Lightly Equipped, General Du's Determination and Amiability</p>
<p>General Du Yuming stayed in Chifeng for more than three hours. In addition to listening to military reports and giving instructions, he encouraged the responsible persons of the county government and party and government organs, as well as Mongol and Hui compatriots, to work together to build a new Chifeng.</p>
<p>At 3:20 p.m., the reporter rushed to the large airfield nine li outside the western suburbs. With a few horn blasts, the propeller started, and the plane quickly took off, bidding farewell to Chifeng. On the return journey, we took a direct flight route over Fuxin and returned to Shenyang at 4:50 p.m.</p>
<p>General Du traveled lightly, with only one adjutant, and the rest were six journalists. General Du's determination, vigilance, amiability, and approachability were the common impressions of our group of reporters.</p>

<h3>Talking About Shaanxi Cotton in Early Winter</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent in Xi'an, Li Chi</p>
<p>Xi'an Air Dispatch, 4th</p>
<p>In Jiangnan, we often encounter the weather of "one rain turning into autumn," but in the Northwest, it becomes "one rain turning into winter"! I remember that on the day when the national snow line for this winter exceeded Dihua and Lanzhou last month, Chang'an had a cold rain, and the temperature dropped significantly from then on. A week ago, the snow line crossed Zhiyang again and "entered the pass," and Chang'an also had a cold rain, and the people in the city began to wear cotton-padded jackets and fur robes. On that day, the farmers in the south of the city said: Zhongnan Mountain (one of the remaining veins of the Qinling Mountains, its northern foot is Chang'an) has already put on a snow-white hat!</p>
<p>Speaking of cold and snow, we naturally think of cotton, as white as snow. The importance of cotton in Shaanxi may be greater than many people imagine. Not long ago, the Sino-American Agricultural Cooperation Group came to Shaanxi for investigation, and the relevant departments here provided the following proud figures: "Starting from the 30th year of the Republic [1941], the government began to collect cotton fields nationwide (that is, to pay land tax with cotton in kind), which was actually mainly relied on Shaanxi. In the 34th year of the Republic [1945], Shaanxi accounted for 100% of the total national cotton tax..." Although we are sorry for the soldiers who fought in the war and were unable to eat or dress warmly, the people of Shaanxi can truly say without shame: The cotton yarn and cotton cloth worn by the brothers were all dedicated to the government by the cotton farmers of Shaanxi without receiving a penny, except for the military supplies purchased with money by the military supply department. Even the military cotton purchased by the government, Shaanxi cotton accounted for the first place in quantity!</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the cotton-producing areas in North China and Central China were gradually recovered. However, the importance of Shaanxi cotton has not been reduced. According to this year's national cotton production forecast, the total harvest is 5 million dan (that is, 50 kilograms, the same below), of which Shaanxi accounts for one-ninth, or 550,000 dan. By province, Shaanxi ranks fourth, second only to Hubei, Hebei, and Jiangsu. However, it is doubtful whether the three provinces of Zheng, Ji, and Su will actually reach the expected figures this year due to the war.</p>
<p>I also found statistics on world cotton production in books. From 1935 to 1939, the average annual output was 7 billion kilograms, of which 3 billion kilograms of American cotton accounted for almost half, and 600 million kilograms of Chinese cotton accounted for about one-eleventh of the total. What proportion did Shaanxi cotton account for at that time? According to the records of the Eastern Province: From 1934 to 1940, the average annual output of Shaanxi cotton was 52.5 million kilograms (Note: These seven years were also the "golden age" of Shaanxi cotton in the 25 years since records began!). In other words, during the above-mentioned period, only Shaanxi Province (more precisely, only the cotton fields in the "Jingwei area" of Guanzhong) accounted for one-eleventh of the national cotton production and one-hundred-and-thirtieth of the world cotton production!</p>
<p>From the two figures listed above, careful readers will surely see that the annual average output of Shaanxi cotton between six and twelve years ago was more than double this year's output. Yes, since 1940, when cotton was cheap and wheat and rice were expensive, many farmland were converted to food crops, the output of Shaanxi cotton began to decrease. The smallest year was 1942, when the harvest of 15 million kilograms of cotton was only one-third of the "golden age" of Shaanxi cotton. Fortunately, there has been an increase in the past four years, and this year's harvest has increased by almost one-tenth compared to last year's 25 million kilograms.</p>
<p>Looking at the records of the history of Shaanxi's cotton industry over the past ten years, we should know that the rise or fall of local cotton prices always stimulates or suppresses the total area of cotton fields and the total output of cotton. According to the records of the price ratio between cotton and wheat in Xi'an City over the past ten years, cotton was the most expensive in the summer and autumn of 1940, when one catty of cotton could be exchanged for more than seven catties of wheat, and this year was also the last year of the "golden age" for cotton farmers. Afterwards, cotton prices never caught up with grain prices, and cotton production followed, sharply decreasing from 1941 onwards. Cotton was the cheapest in the winter of 1941, when one catty of cotton could not be exchanged for three catties of wheat. On the eve of Japan's surrender in early August last year, it was even as low as only two catties of wheat. At the end of September this year, the price of cotton fell by another three-quarters! Later, prices rose again from stability, and although cotton was no exception, the profits were returned to the pockets of cotton merchants, because most cotton farmers had already been forced to sell to cotton merchants at the end of autumn and the beginning of winter, regardless of price. This year's cotton price is much better than last year's. The current market situation is that one catty of cotton can be exchanged for four and a half catties of wheat, and the land tax on cotton fields this year is levied on grain instead of cotton, so cotton farmers can finally take a breather. (The above prices are all based on wholesale prices)</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the "quality" of Shaanxi cotton. Although the "quality" of cotton includes many items in agronomy, the main thing from an application (textile) perspective is to look at the length of the cotton fiber. Because too short cotton fibers can only be spun into coarse yarn of 10 to 16 counts, and the tensile strength is not enough, so it can only be woven into coarse cloth. The main use of Shaanxi cotton during the Anti-Japanese War was to spin coarse yarn of 16 counts for military uniforms, so most of the yarn factories here also focused on 16-count yarn. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai cloth and foreign cloth were continuously transported westward to Shaanxi, and the textile industry in Shaanxi Province began to use Shaanxi cotton to spin a large amount of 20-count yarn. If you want to make it finer, the problem does not lie in the quality of Shaanxi cotton, but in the equipment and technology of the yarn factories in Shaanxi Province. It is said that state-owned and private yarn factories in Shanghai have used Shaanxi cotton as experimental materials, and the results can spin up to 32-count fine yarn, in other words, it is enough to weave commonly used fine cloth with surplus.</p>
<p>Today, whether viewed from the perspective of quality or quantity, Shaanxi cotton obviously still has room for "further development," but its current achievements are not achieved by chance overnight. This example may be a good reference for agricultural experts.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the limiting conditions for cotton-producing areas. As is well known, Shaanxi is a province that is narrow from east to west and long from north to south. From a natural geographical point of view, it can be divided into three regions: Northern Shaanxi, Guanzhong, and Southern Shaanxi. The former belongs to the Loess Plateau, and water is lacking. It is better to develop it into a pastoral area. Only the latter two, namely the Weihe and Hanshui Basins, are fully equipped with farming conditions. According to the conclusion of Mr. Li Guozhen, a researcher of Shaanxi cotton: "Not only latitude restricts the regional boundaries of cotton-producing areas, but also altitude, terrain, rainfall, temperature... etc., are all equally important factors." From this, we can know that there are reasons why the cotton-producing area of Shaanxi Province is concentrated in Guanzhong today, and why Northern Shaanxi, which is more south than the cotton-producing area of Zhengding and other counties in Hebei Province, is not suitable for cotton planting. Currently, cotton fields in Guanzhong account for 90% of the cotton area in Shaanxi Province, Southern Shaanxi accounts for 8%, and Northern Shaanxi only accounts for 2%. If Guanzhong area is divided in detail, it can be divided into five areas: the Yellow River area, the eastern part of the province, the "Jinghui Canal" benefit area, the area near the provincial capital, and other areas. The "Jingwei area" is currently a major cotton-producing area.</p>
<p>It is obvious that under the guidance of the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute (where Mr. Li Guozhen serves as the director) for many years, the quality and yield per mu of cotton have made amazing progress. To be more precise, I still have to go back to the Shaanxi Provincial Cotton Experiment Farm in 1924, which first started to improve cotton, and the Agricultural Improvement Institute, which focused on improving the varieties of Shaanxi cotton from 1934 onwards. After twenty-two years of continuous efforts like one day, we have today's achievements, "Rome was not built in a day"!</p>
<p>Currently, the best-performing varieties in this province are "Sizi No. 4" and "Dezi" cotton, both of which are American varieties. "Sizi No. 4" performs the best. The cotton fiber length reaches 29 mm, and the highest harvest record has exceeded the ordinary Shaanxi varieties by 68.8%. From this, we can know how important it is to improve seeds. "Sizi" cotton has been "settled" in Shaanxi for more than ten years. The cotton farmers in the Guanzhong area trust it very much, but the knowledge of agriculture is still backward, so how to maintain the purity and excellent performance of the seeds is an important topic in the "Shaanxi Provincial Cotton Production Quality Improvement Symposium."</p>
<p>Relevant parties are planning to grade the quality of cotton. They seem to want to evaluate the grades of cotton before it is massively launched on the market through organizations such as farmers' associations in various places, just like Shanghai's inspection of raw silk. The implementation of this plan will inevitably encounter difficulties at first, but the beneficiaries will still be cotton farmers in the future, because after the scientific inspection of cotton, they will understand whether their products are better or worse than others, so they will strive to improve them in order to "upgrade" their products. A greater significance is to ensure the quality of each level, so that buyers can use them with confidence, and over time, the confidence of customers will naturally increase.</p>
<p>Some people were worried about the future of this year's 550,000 dan of new cotton, because military cotton is no longer needed in large quantities, and the government no longer collects in kind. But now it seems that this is just "worrying about the sky." Taking "China Textile" alone, it has already started purchasing more than 200,000 dan in Shaanxi, and other local textile factories have also been purchasing new cotton one after another. Sales and prices are not a problem. The only problem is whether transportation can be smoother. We hope that excessive freight will not be added to cheap Shaanxi cotton (the current wholesale price of net cotton is about 1,100 to 1,200 yuan per catty), so that it cannot resist the dumping of American cotton, Indian cotton, and Brazilian cotton, which account for the first place in imports.</p>
<p>The situation of Shaanxi cotton is good, and the rural economy of Shaanxi is of course also good. It can even be said that if Shaanxi cotton sells well, the sales of Shanghai cotton cloth transported in will also be good, because the purchasing power of rural areas has increased. Shaanxi cotton is only "traveling" to Shanghai once, but by making such a circle, both the old Shaanxi farmers and the Shanghai yarn factory female workers benefit.</p>

<h3>Debates on Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>— Traditional First</p>
<p>By Jin Liangben, Youth Publishing House</p>
<p>The Republic of China has been established for thirty-five years. The lack of a comprehensive constitutionalism that is adhered to nationwide has led to the shaking of the national foundation and frequent wars, which everyone knows is a great regret. The National Assembly, which the entire nation yearns for, has been postponed five times due to factual and environmental relations. Just a few days ago, the government explicitly announced that it would be convened on November 12th of this year. Now, the deadline has been extended by three days to allow all parties and factions to submit representative lists. The Chinese constitutionalism issue, which has been debated for decades, may finally be resolved, comforting the nationwide eager anticipation. Mr. Jin Liangben's book takes an objective stance and provides a precise and fair response to the various theoretical criticisms of the "May 5th Draft Constitution." In today's world of confused thoughts and unclear right and wrong, it is worth reading, especially for the National Assembly representatives who bear the responsibility of drafting the constitution, who should each have a copy.</p>
<p>This book consists of five chapters. The first chapter is an introduction, with the first section describing the introduction of the constitutionalism issue. The second section discusses the concept of the constitution, dividing it into formal and substantive aspects. The third section discusses the relationship between the constitution and democratic politics.</p>
<p>As for the second chapter, "The Debates and Criticisms of Various Parties Regarding the Implementation of Constitutionalism During the War," we believe that the circumstances have changed, and there is no need for lengthy discussion. The fourth chapter discusses the Kuomintang's attitude towards the constitutionalism issue. The first section discusses the Kuomintang's theoretical advocacy for constitutionalism, citing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. It thoroughly examines the Kuomintang's advocacy for civil rights, constitutionalism, and the implementation of constitutionalism, as well as its commitment to the spirit of political tutelage. The second section discusses the Kuomintang's historical struggle for constitutionalism. There is no need to say much about it. The most brilliant discussion is in the third section, "The Debates and Criticisms of the May 5th Draft Constitution." Unfortunately, due to space limitations, we cannot introduce it in detail, so we can only excerpt a little, allowing readers to get a glimpse.</p>
<p>The first section of the third chapter discusses the principle of national self-determination. It supports the original draft constitution's statement that "all ethnic groups in the Republic of China are members of the Chinese nation, and all are equal." It repeatedly clarifies the differences between the Three People's Principles constitution and the Soviet socialist constitution, citing Soviet examples and addressing those who propose the "three principles of national self-determination." Therefore, national self-determination has its conditions. First, it should be built on the condition of mutual assistance. … Second, it should not harm national unity as its highest principle. … However, Article 30 of the Soviet Constitution ensures that some ethnic minorities, like other ethnic groups, obtain an equal voice in the central government. … This intention is worth our reference.</p>
<p>The second section discusses the issue of restricting the people's freedom and rights according to law. It cites recent academic theories and opposes the "absolute theory of people's rights" and individual liberalism. The author cites examples from the constitutions of various countries, such as the German Weimar Constitution, the Mexican Constitution, and the Soviet Constitution, proving that the slight restrictions on the people's freedom and rights in the May 5th Draft Constitution are not problematic in principle.</p>
<p>National Assembly Representatives</p>
<p>The third section discusses the issue of the National Assembly, National Representatives, and the National Political Council. Regarding (1) the powers and duration of the National Assembly, it advocates that the powers of the current assembly should comply with the National Assembly Organization Law promulgated and revised in 1937. "The reason is that the constitution itself should stipulate which body exercises the constitution's power. If the National Assembly, which is organized to draft the constitution, exercises the powers conferred by the constitution according to the Organization Law, it is tantamount to deciding the issues that the constitution should decide with the Organization Law, limiting the power of the constitutional body with the Organization Law, predetermining the content of the constitution, and submitting it to the constitution-making body in advance." Regarding the duration of the assembly, it supports Mr. Sun Zhe-sheng's proposal to change the National Assembly from once every three years to once every year. (2) The issue of National Assembly representatives: After refuting the proposal to re-elect all National Assembly representatives based on legal principles, it discusses the central government's instructions: "The National Assembly Organization Law and the National Representative Election Law have been solemnly promulgated by the National Government in accordance with legislative procedures and implemented by the National Government. The representatives elected in accordance with the Election Law, "except for those who are found to be traitors and should be dealt with by the government according to law, should all be valid." This is very reasonable. However, it expresses great dissatisfaction with the National Assembly Representative Election Law, saying, "It is extremely controlled and violates the original theory of the election system. … It is hoped that the government authorities will make immediate remedies." Now, according to the agreement of the Political Consultative Conference, the number of National Assembly representatives has been greatly expanded, which may slightly remedy the shortcomings of the election law. (3) The issue of establishing a National Political Council, which was proposed by Zhang Junmai and others, is somewhat similar to the idea of organizing a standing committee during the adjournment of the National Assembly proposed by He Sijing and others. Organizations like the standing committee were ultimately abolished because they violated the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's five-power constitution, even though they had passed three readings in the initial draft of the constitution. The powers of the National Political Council are even broader, "not only encompassing political power but also governing power." This violates the spirit of the five-power constitution.</p>
<p>Presidential Powers</p>
<p>The fourth section discusses the issue of presidential powers. Some believe that the provisions for presidential powers in the draft constitution are too broad and should be revised. Others believe that the president should control all governing power, i.e., strengthen executive power. It disagrees with both views. It clearly states: "If more than half of the provinces in the country have not reached the beginning of the constitutional period, and the National Assembly is convened and the constitution is promulgated, then the exercise of the powers of the National Assembly convened under this constitution cannot be compared with the exercise of the powers of the National Assembly convened after more than half of the provinces in the country have reached the beginning of the constitutional period. At a minimum, the latter's exercise of powers should be broader and more thorough than the former's exercise of powers. … Now that more than half of the provinces in the country have not reached the beginning of the constitutional period, … convening the assembly and promulgating the constitution, its exercise of the powers of the National Assembly, the right to elect does not extend to the vice presidents of the Executive, Judicial, and Examination Yuan; the right to recall does not extend to the president and vice president of the Executive Yuan. In other words, the president has the power to appoint and dismiss the president of the Executive Yuan and the power to appoint the presidents and vice presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuan. Is there anything worthy of criticism? If, therefore, it is believed that the president's powers are too broad, it is even more unnecessary. To be honest, the current provisions regarding the president's powers in the draft constitution are merely adopting a responsible presidential system. Therefore, this provision in the draft constitution can be said to be in line with the original intention of the Founding Program." This argument has considerable merit in light of the current situation, but the constitution is not like ordinary law; it is more permanent and cannot be easily changed. Even though more than half of the provinces have not reached the beginning of the constitutional period now, does that mean they will never reach the beginning of the constitutional period?</p>
<p>Central and Local</p>
<p>All the theories in this book are entirely based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. "The Founding Program is the last and greatest work of the Founding Father; Article 24 of the Founding Program clearly stipulates that after the constitution is promulgated, the central governing power shall be exercised by the National Assembly; that is, the National Assembly has the right to elect and recall central government officials and the right to initiate and veto laws. Since it says "central government officials" without distinction, it is clear that the presidents of all the Yuan are included. Now, the draft constitution assigns the power to appoint and dismiss the president of the Executive Yuan and the power to appoint the presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuan to the president, rather than the National Assembly. This is clearly in conflict with the Founding Program personally drafted by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Why insist on defending it? Why not advocate following the Founding Program? If it is believed to hinder the responsible presidential system, is not the presidential system in the five-power constitution the creation of the Founding Program? Even if we want to thoroughly implement the responsible presidential system, we believe that the appointment of the presidents and vice presidents of the Executive, Judicial, and Examination Yuan should at least be changed to being nominated by the president and submitted to the National Assembly for approval. This should not violate the original intention of the separation of five powers. As for the argument to strengthen executive power and have the president control all governing power, those who cannot even distinguish between governing power and executive power are simply not worth arguing with.</p>
<p>The fifth section discusses the issue of adding a chapter on "Central and Local Government." Its conclusion is: "(1) The powers of the central and local governments are not based on a system of separation of powers but on a system of balanced powers; it should not list the powers of the central government, leaving the unlisted to the local governments; it should list the powers of the local governments, leaving the unlisted to the central government."</p>
<p>The author advocates retaining the original plan for the sixth section on the national economy and the seventh section on education. The defenses are quite insightful.</p>
<p>In summary, this book can be said to be a response to the "May 5th Draft Constitution" and a loyal supporter of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution. Except for admitting that a chapter on central and local government should be added and supplementing the text of the chapter on education, it believes that all articles in the draft constitution do not need to be amended. Although there are some far-fetched points, such as the issue of presidential powers, which I have already criticized above. Also, saying that "party rule is necessarily democratic" is also very problematic. But in general, it stands on the position of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution to criticize the various criticisms of the May 5th Draft Constitution, which can be considered very objective and fair.</p>
<h3>A Pictorial History of World War II</h3>
<p>— Upright</p>
<p>Compiled and written by Shu Zongqiao, published by United Pictorial</p>
<p>I have read several Chinese versions of the history of World War II, and I feel that there are problems with their content and style. The materials are not complete, especially regarding the part about China's resistance war, which is either completely ignored or too brief. It seems to have overlooked China's eight-year resistance war and fourteen-year arduous struggle in the place it should have in World War II. Furthermore, there are no complete photos and maps to dominate the evolution of military, political, and diplomatic events during the war, making it increasingly boring and greatly reducing the interest in reading. In terms of style, the stance and organization cannot balance the various resistance forces. I have also read a history of the Great War written by an American and a pictorial history of the Great War written by a Briton. The former has detailed text and abundant maps, but it ignores many war situations on the Chinese battlefield and does not provide a relaxed and enjoyable reading experience with any war photos. The latter has a good combination of text, maps, and photos, and the narration is detailed enough. After all, the compilers are worthy of being Anglo-Saxons and use "white eyes" to observe our country's position in the Great War and invisibly reduce many of our country's heroic resistance deeds. It is disappointing after reading.</p>
<p>It is really not easy to write a war history that takes a firm, fair, and faithful stand without mixing in any political colors or propaganda, because we cannot easily read a true war history that is not arrogant or wronged. In addition, due to the limitations of our country's material conditions, it is really not easy to write a pictorial history that does not have the above shortcomings and is suitable for the taste of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The Pictorial History of World War II, compiled and written by Shu Zongqiao, has recently been published. From the content and style, although it is difficult to achieve perfection, it can be said that the emergence of this pictorial history is a pioneer in the pictorial history world due to the compiler's more than ten years of experience in news work in the front and rear and the large amount of data provided by the US News Agency to United Pictorial during the war. From the perspective of the amount of photos, the selection of some photos from the large number of photos collected by United Pictorial during the eight years of resistance war can be called the essence of the photos, which can't be considered anything less than a major success for the compiler. Among them, eight color pictures are a unique feature of the pictures. Photos that are not easily seen outside include the Chongqing Tunnel Disaster, the fire net in the sky over Sicily, the tragic scene of Berlin after the war, London, New York, Chongqing, Moscow, Shanghai celebrating victory, which are realistic and vivid, and are quite valuable. Furthermore, Stalin and Matsuoka Yosuke hooking arms, Puyi ascending the throne, and Mussolini hanging upside down in Milan are even more historically ironic.</p>
<p>The book has 400 pages and 400,000 words. Its greatest feature is that the part about China's resistance war is particularly detailed, accounting for about one-third of the book, which is rare in the various war histories published at home and abroad. The book narrates all the battles and campaigns on each battlefield, regardless of size or duration, in detail. In addition to vivid photos as evidence, the text also includes detailed diagrams of the military situation evolution of each battlefield and an appendix of 70 major documents between international organizations and Allied and Axis powers, plus the documents of the Paris Peace Conference, which is currently being held. Therefore, the book is extremely helpful for civic education materials, historical and geographical common sense, and thematic research. Moreover, the compiler treats the various resistance forces in our country equally, without bias, and his fair and broad spirit can be regarded as a guide for later compilers of war history. However, it is hoped that future improvements can be made in printing and paper quality.</p>
<h3>The Post-War World Colonial Issue</h3>
<p>— Naya</p>
<p>Shi Xiaochong's "The Post-War World Colonial Issue," New China Publishing House, first edition in August 1946</p>
<p>Regarding the post-war world, strong countries are known to everyone; and those colonies are equally important. We should have a full understanding of this issue. However, not many people pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Because disputes between strong countries are often caused by colonial issues, to understand the international situation, one must first understand the colonial issue, and from this, one can further understand the relationships and situations between countries.</p>
<p>This book, "The Post-War World Colonial Issue," discusses the current stage of the world's colonial issues.</p>
<p>First, it lists the area and population of the colonies occupied by the three countries of Britain, France, and Germany in the 19th century; and compares the percentage of colonies occupied by European powers.</p>
<p>From this, it describes the independence movements in various colonies in the twenty years after World War I, such as: India, Korea, Vietnam, Egypt, Morocco, and other countries. The book briefly states the beginning and end of their movements and their results.</p>
<p>Next, it discusses the dynamics of the world's colonies during World War II; and then discusses the dynamics of the various colonies after the war and the current situation of their demands for independence.</p>
<p>Under these topics, the author uses materials from various sources to fully explain, so that after reading, one can clearly understand the current world colonial issue.</p>
<p>Finally, the author also makes a prospect for the world's colonies, hoping that each colony will be able to survive freely as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I will not elaborate further. In short, this book tells us some new world knowledge. It is worth reading for people from all walks of life!</p>
<h3>Peace, peace, how many hypocrites borrow your beautiful name.</h3>

<h3>An Englishman's Impression of China</h3>
<p>— Shaw</p>
<p>Published by Macmillan Company of America in 1946, 217 pages, priced at US$2.75. Author: Richard P. Dobson. The original title of the book is China Cycle, which can be translated as "Impressions of China."</p>
<p>There are many books written by foreigners about China, but too many of them are biased. In general, foreigners do not understand China and have very limited knowledge of China. On the one hand, we should do our best to publicize, and at the same time, we cannot ignore foreign accounts of China. There is very little news about China in American newspapers. At most, there is a short telegram every two or three days. Its position is often very inconspicuous. This is what the compatriots in the United States feel most annoyed about.</p>
<p>The author of Impressions of China is a young Englishman who came to China in 1936 on behalf of the British American Tobacco Company to sell goods. He traveled to many places in China and developed a good impression of the Chinese people. In 1941, he joined the British Royal Air Force as a pilot. He does not consider himself a thinker, and he does not have any amazing writing, but there is one most valuable aspect, that is, he is not interested in politics and does not have national prejudices. From his lack of political motives, he discovered and believed that China is a great country, and although it is currently in deep trouble, its future is unlimited.</p>
<p>Although he loves China very much, his racial prejudices are difficult to remove. For example, he opposes the deterioration of relations between Britain and Germany because this harms Western unity and benefits the East. He attacks Portugal's compromise with the East. He also praises his German friends, such as their loyalty to the country. But he is extremely dissatisfied with the French, and he considers Americans to be frivolous and naive. He has no criticism of Russia.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Dobson has these prejudices and some mistakes, his sincerity and his humility, his willingness to learn, and his acceptance of others' opinions make his prejudices unimportant. He expresses deep sympathy for China, which shows his sincere intention. No wonder Richard Watts said when reviewing this book, "After reading this book, you feel that the author is a very approachable friend, very suitable for traveling with you in China."</p>
<p>The author praises Chongqing very much, not only because he believes that it has a geographical advantage, but also because he believes that it is sufficient to represent the vitality and energy of the Chinese people. However, he made a mistake in the population figure, doubling it. However, these are minor flaws and are not worth emphasizing.</p>
<p>However, the author can see many shortcomings in the character of the Chinese people and the country, and he points them out without hesitation. He points out poverty, disease, and corruption. He also points out the lack of responsibility on the part of conscription and officials. These shortcomings are not enough to shake his confidence in the Chinese people. He believes that the Chinese people have unlimited vitality and an indomitable spirit. The Chinese people have these virtues, which are the raw materials for creating a great country. He believes that China has the largest population and the most history, and once politics is on track, China's future is unlimited, and no force can stop this. And in this respect, no other nation in the world can surpass China.</p>
<p>We are very grateful for the hope that Dobson has for China. All Chinese people should work hard in this direction. Whenever foreigners come to China, they always mention corruption, as if corruption is inseparable from China. Some pamphlets issued by the U.S. military also have special columns telling new American soldiers in China that everyone in China is "oiling" (taking bribes). If you ask a friend to buy something, if he is a good person, he will only take a 10% commission. This kind of misconception is of course an insult to China. However, if there were no large-scale corruption phenomena in our country, how could we give foreigners this impression? Generally speaking, foreigners have sympathy and hope for China. Once our country's politics is on track, it will undoubtedly be the strongest country in the world, and compatriots living abroad can also breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Annals</p>
<h3>Suggestion to the Academia Sinica to Establish a Special Problems Research Institute</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>From October 20th to 25th, the second session of the third council meeting of the Academia Sinica was held in the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China. In his address, Chairman Jiang stated, "Without science, there is no national defense." On October 31st, Chairman Jiang's sixtieth birthday, the Ministry of Education stipulated that from that day until October of the following year, it would be designated as "The Year of Promoting Education to Celebrate Longevity." These two grand events each had their own merits, but they stirred a small feeling within me.</p>
<p>"Without science, there is no national defense" is a self-evident and unquestionable truth. However, China has been advocating science for many years. While we do not deny that China's science has made considerable progress, we must also admit that China's scientific progress is too slow, far from comparable to advanced countries! Today, we can almost say that China relies on the science of others for its national defense. This is an extremely abnormal and dangerous phenomenon! The formation of this phenomenon is, of course, due to a poor academic environment - at present, Chinese intellectuals face the intersection of "academics" and "hunger and cold," where survival itself is a problem, let alone academics? - but also due to a lack of scientific spirit.</p>
<p>What is scientific spirit? Descartes' "Discourse on Method": (1) Do not accept anything as true that you do not clearly recognize as such; (2) Divide each of the difficulties under examination into as many parts as possible, and as might be necessary for its adequate solution; (3) Conduct your thoughts in such order that, by commencing with objects the simplest and easiest to know, you may ascend little by little, and, as it were, step by step, to the knowledge of the more complex; and (4) In every case institute complete enumerations, and general reviews, as to be assured that nothing was omitted. This method is naturally the scientific method, and its basis and development are the scientific spirit. To put it more succinctly, the so-called scientific spirit is the ancient saying, "To know when you know, and to know when you do not know: this is knowledge."</p>
<p>The slow progress of Chinese science also suffers from pedantry. Old-fashioned literati have old-fashioned pedantry: "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for application: Chinese culture should not be underestimated!" New-style literati have new-style pedantry: "China has no science at all. What is Chinese science? It's superstition, it's just grandma's tales!" Both err on the side of "bias" and are incompatible with science, being foolish, childish, and laughable! They commit a common ailment: "Self-satisfaction upon acquiring a little knowledge, ashamed to ask questions!"</p>
<p>They do not know that in these "superstitions" and "grandma's tales," there are many problems worth our research. We should extensively absorb foreign science and, at the same time, extract the essence from these "superstitions" and "grandma's tales" and combine them with authentic science to open up new avenues. Graduates with doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degrees often look down on these "superstitions" and "grandma's tales," not even deigning to ask about them, let alone research them! What is the result? "To be ignorant of one thing is the shame of a Confucian scholar": we only see that they are not "broad," not "learned," not "scholarly," and not "gentlemanly"! Below, I will give a few examples to prove that "superstition" or "grandma's tales" are not purely without research value.</p>
<p>The first example: Driving corpses. In the mountainous provinces of the southwest, there is a peculiar method of transporting corpses called "driving corpses." The Chinese concept of home is extremely strong: "A tree may grow a thousand feet tall, but its leaves fall back to its roots." The coffin of a person who dies away from home must be transported back to their hometown for burial. However, what if one encounters towering mountains and steep ridges, where even the living find it difficult to walk, let alone transport a coffin? What to do? So, sorcerers come to solicit business: they work in pairs, wearing half-red, half-green clothing, carrying water-fire sticks, one leading and one following, with five to seven masked corpses in between. They chant incantations, and the corpses obediently walk in single file, not acting strangely or decaying, until they reach the home of each corpse, where they lie down horizontally to be placed in coffins. You say, "This is a myth!" It just so happens that this was told to me by two scientific doctors who "witnessed" this event. They would never lie, nor would they need to lie.</p>
<p>The second example: Chenzhou Talismans. In the autumn of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, I first arrived in Chongqing. At that time, Shangqingsi was quite desolate, with only flat houses. One day, I walked past a certain house and saw a large yellow paper poster pasted at the door, with the three characters "Chenzhou Talisman" written on it. The door was open, and in the middle of the hall, there was a paper figure cut out of yellow paper, kneeling on one knee, holding a porcelain basin full of water in its hand. I walked past, then walked back. The person sitting in the hall smiled at me and said, "Don't believe it?" I also smiled and replied, "I don't believe it! Can I try it?" "Of course!" I pinched the paper figure, and it was indeed paper, with no steel wire or anything like that inside. I tapped the basin, and it made a clear sound. I dipped two fingers into the water, and when I pulled them out, they were dripping wet, it really was water! In the end, I was baffled!</p>
<p>The third example: DunJia. This is what I saw in Hankou in July of this year. A fortune-teller was standing, not sitting, and there was no table. He simply placed a square of oilcloth on the sidewalk, with the "Eight Trigrams" and "Taijitu" painted on the cloth. A small yellow paper package was placed in the center of the "Taijitu." A mid-level civil servant walked by, glanced at it, and stopped to ask the fortune-teller to tell his fortune. The fortune-teller handed him a piece of white paper (note the color) and a pencil, saying, "Don't speak! But write down your age, eight characters, family members, and what you want to ask, one by one, fold the paper, and don't tell me. Then I will open this small yellow paper seal for you to see: if what is written on the two papers is the same, then it is effective, and you can ask further; if it is different, then it is not, and you can go on your way without spending half a penny!" Then the writer wrote himself, and the fortune-teller cast the talisman himself. The result of opening and viewing was that what was written on the yellow and white papers was the same! You say, "The two colluded to cheat!" It's possible, but being effective only works once; if it's not effective the second time, he doesn't charge a penny. Wouldn't he starve?</p>
<p>There are many more strange things like this! I could very well follow the fashion and say lightly, "This is superstition!" But my conscience is uneasy because this is not a question of "superstition" or not "superstition," but a matter of "not understanding" through and through! Since one does not understand, one should not make rash judgments but should thoroughly research to seek "understanding": this is the scientific spirit.</p>
<p>However, on the one hand, thorough research takes much time and money; on the other hand, this kind of magic is passed on to sons but not to daughters, solely to preserve secrets and protect the rice bowl. If we want to learn, we must first solve the teacher's livelihood problems. Thirdly, this type of research necessarily involves a wide range of fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, botany, folklore, society, history, geography, and religion, all of which are closely related: therefore, one person's energy and financial resources are not enough, and there must be a huge academic group as a backing.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people think these are not urgent matters. Excuse me, I want to scoff at that! Fifty years ago, if a visionary had described to us the rockets, missiles, radars, televisions, atomic bombs, and cosmic rays of fifty years later, would we not have laughed at him for daydreaming? Moreover, the research objects are not limited to the above three examples. The person in charge of this research does not have to be a scientist himself—he will never be an all-around doctor—but he must have broad common sense, a strong desire for knowledge, and especially a full scientific spirit, as well as real scientists as assistants.</p>
<p>I suggest to the Academia Sinica to establish a "Special Problems Research Institute."</p>

<h3>Mountain City Sketches</h3>
<p>— Su Dan</p>
<p>Violets</p>
<p>When the sun is still hidden behind the thick fog, the small crossroads of the farm are wet, as if there had been a heavy rain last night. Water droplets drip from the grapevines, and the faint sound of water droplets falling on dry leaves can be heard here and there. The weak and powerless chrysanthemums droop their fluffy heads, some even intertwining their necks and sprawling on the ground. The orange trees and Podocarpus are bathed in the fog, their leaves even greener. The short and fat agave arrogantly spreads its thorny leaves to bear the fog, just like a brave warrior exposing his prickly chest to cool off on a summer night.</p>
<p>Fog, fog everywhere. Heavy...</p>
<p>In the nursery, the violets are only a little over two inches tall. Last Sunday, when I came to see them, their slender stems were supporting a few half-unfolded tender leaves. It's still like that now. It seems to have been frightened by the weather of this early winter and dare not grow any taller. But the old gardener said that he expects it to bloom purple flowers in the spring. Now is the time when trees shed all their leaves (the peach trees, poplars, and phoenix trees are all left with bare branches). From time to time at night, cold winds and rain force their way in, and hasn't frost already appeared several times with a stern face? A few days ago, the sky was gloomy as if heavy snow was about to fall. Although people say it's warm here, snow may not fall, and the wind won't be as piercing as in the borderlands. But who can truly predict the weather now?</p>
<p>There's fog this morning. The fog will clear in a while. After it clears, it will let the warm sunshine through. So, say good morning to the violets.</p>
<p>Cat</p>
<p>At midnight, when I was awakened several times by cunning mice, I always thought of cats.</p>
<p>The next morning, when I found several places in my beloved book gnawed through and the ink bottle on the table knocked over, I thought of cats even more.</p>
<p>But I don't like cats.</p>
<p>I wrote to my sister far away, saying that the room I live in now needs to have a cat. But I have many things to do and have no time to take care of a cat, and I don't love cats either. I also told her that when I was a child, one winter night, I woke up and suddenly heard a cooing sound near my ear. I was so scared that I screamed and buried my head in the quilt, just yelling for my mother. It turned out that the neighbor's tabby cat was squatting by my head. I didn't know if it was close to me to keep warm or if it wanted to scratch me. Or... I scolded it: "You can't not let me know at all." Another day at noon, I was sitting on a low stool in the yard, concentrating on playing with picture cards. A few sparrows were hopping in front of me, pecking at food. I didn't pay attention to them or anything around me at all. Suddenly, a cat leaped out from behind me and caught one of them and ran away. I was so frightened that I dropped all the picture cards and ran into the house crying. I remembered that it had been sneaking up behind me a long time ago. Since then, I have been afraid of cats' footsteps being too quiet - although it never scratched me - a kind of fearful shock has been entrenched in my heart, running through my childhood. I don't understand why this childhood fear hasn't faded from my heart after so many years, just like a small mark I poked on my forehead in childhood, which is still on my forehead.</p>
<p>"Then let the mice drive you to move."</p>
<p>My sister replied jokingly in her letter.</p>
<p>I can't move. I don't like cats either, but I'm thinking of another way to subdue the cunning mice in the room.</p>
<h3>Scattered Notes on Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Uncle Sun Ruying</p>
<p>The Grand Canal</p>
<p>This is the Grand Canal. It is not wide, nor does it have towering waves. It just flows slowly, quietly, and gently. Since I was very young, it has been like this; now, I have been separated from it for ten years, and it is still like this. When I left it, I was still a child, and when I see it again, I have already embarked on the path of adulthood. The Grand Canal is forever unchanging, but I cannot always remain young!</p>
<p>Now it is autumn, and the willows growing on the river embankment are about to wither. The withered yellow clusters of leaves are blown down by the west wind, floating on the lonely river. The weeds also look very withered and thin, desperately looking up at a high and vast sky. Under my feet is brown soil. Stepping on it, I know that this is my hometown. I search for the dreams I lost in my childhood on this brown soil, but I cannot even find the footprints of my childhood.</p>
<p>The people of the Grand Canal are forever immersed in the abyss of suffering. I can still feel the shock that the flood more than ten years ago gave me. Now, the people of the Grand Canal have struggled out of another man-made disaster. The water flowing in the Grand Canal must no longer be water, but the tears of the people, right?</p>
<p>I was born on the Grand Canal, and I am also a child of the Grand Canal. But I never shed tears in the river. I exchanged this more unfortunate and tragic fate for an unfortunate wandering life. Now, I have returned to the banks of the Grand Canal. Facing the Grand Canal, which is our mother, I really cannot suppress my sorrow!</p>
<p>Homeland</p>
<p>I stepped into my long-separated homeland, as if stepping into a strange place. A wall blocks the door I used to enter and exit in my childhood, and another door opened next to it replaces it. I groped along the winding path, walking towards the house where I was born.</p>
<p>I was born here, and I spent more than ten years of the happiest time of my life here. This ceiling, this window, should all remember the stories of my childhood. But everything here seems strange to me, and the house also seems to have become shorter and darker. When the vast dusk is still floating in the courtyard, an oil lamp must be lit indoors.</p>
<p>Everything has changed, the homeland, and myself. But the change in myself is greater than that of the homeland. Due to the change in the homeland and my own growth, a heavier layer of separation has been added between the homeland and myself. When I was wandering outside, thousands of mountains and rivers were the barrier between me and my homeland. When I returned home, my own irretrievable years blocked me from my homeland.</p>
<p>Slowly, I finally found the homeland in my memory, and I began to feel familiar with this long-separated homeland. I saw the apricot tree I climbed in my childhood, and I saw the target ring I drew on the wall in my childhood. I seemed to have returned to my childhood, as if I was playing with my brothers who still cannot return home. Only now do I understand the meaning of the golden childhood, but it is too late, and I can no longer linger a step in that golden age.</p>
<p>Open Space</p>
<p>Could this be the school where I studied for six years? There is no house here, no wall, not even a stone, not a tree. This is just an open space, an open space growing with withered grass!</p>
<p>I walked on this open space, and so many memories welled up in my heart. The old school building, the rows of winter green trees, the fat old Zhan who guarded the door, the aging face of the old teacher who once held me in his arms... All of this can no longer be seen, and even the opportunity to think of them affectionately is very rare.</p>
<p>I walked on this open space, mourning my childhood school, and tears welled up in my eyes. No passerby recognized me, and no one knew my state of mind. I really wish I could return to my childhood, carrying my schoolbag and holding my brother's hand to go to school, but that is impossible. My back is already bent, and the school has no shadow!</p>
<p>Open space, tell me, where are my teachers? Where are my classmates? Where have they all gone? Where have they gone? My close friends from my childhood no longer recognize each other when we meet now. This is really an inextricable sorrow!</p>
<p>The setting sun is hanging on the treetops in the distance, and the open space is painted with blood-like sunlight. Such a lonely open space, it probably also remembers the past prosperity, right?</p>
<h3>Boating</h3>
<p>— Sun Qingyang</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 92</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>According to my training, unless I am in a desperate situation, surrounded by enemies on all sides, then I have no choice but to risk my life and engage them in a battle that injures both sides. Otherwise, we must restrain our impulsiveness and proceed carefully step by step until we have exhausted our intelligence, done our best, and left no trace for the enemy to trace and search for, so that they remain completely puzzled. Didn't our general team leader also say, "We must not hesitate to sacrifice, but we must not make unnecessary sacrifices"?</p>
<p>If we were to rush onto the car, fire our guns, and then charge straight out, then I would have to ask some questions. We already know that to break out of this restricted area, we must pass over a bridge. Besides the automatic searchlight, the other defenses on the bridge must be tight and strict, right? What if this bridge is a movable bridge, and as soon as there is an alarm, it immediately moves away, or there are steel gates and electric nets at both ends of the bridge? Please, how can we two Don Quixote-like warriors cross the bridge? Isn't there also a checkpoint at the entrance? Is there really no defensive equipment at all?</p>
<p>To go even further, even if we have broken out, they have plenty of cars, armored vehicles, and trucks here. Can they really not chase us? If they chase us, it would be a tense scene that audiences would most welcome in a movie, but how can we two escape, and where can we escape to? To say that we could abandon the car after escaping for a while and hide in the sorghum fields, but we must not forget that there are also many fierce and agile detective dogs and giant mastiffs in this restricted area.</p>
<p>We have been observing all the way, and since discovering the gas station, I have never stopped planning a safe way to leave. I planned to place a safe igniter inside the gasoline boundary; this igniter must ignite and explode within a dozen minutes after we leave. Then we can retreat safely. So, after telling Tiger Brother about the ignition, I told him to listen to orders and not to be reckless.</p>
<p>I retreated outside the gasoline-soaked area to open my "treasure bag" and take out the incense coil box I was carrying. It was terrible! These incense coils were originally prepared specifically for this type of ignition work. Even the size of an incense coil, how much time it takes, and how much length it burns had been tested long ago, and now they were useful. Who knew that after searching and searching in the bag, I couldn't see the incense coil box. In anger, I dumped everything in the bag on the ground, and I couldn't see the shadow of the box anywhere. (Later, on the way back, I remembered that it must have slipped out when I was groping in the bag for something to eat before crossing the stream, and I didn't pay attention.)</p>
<p>Hurriedly putting the dumped things back in order, I rushed to Tiger Brother and told him to take out his incense coils. He kept turning the pump handle and reached into the bag, and just pulled it out. I took this treasure and retreated outside the gasoline boundary again, opened the box, and heavens! He had incense coils, but where were the incense coils? They had all turned into powder, not even an inch whole. It must have been the hot weather. Although Tiger Brother wasn't sweating, his body was damp. The dampness invaded the box, and with running, jumping, and tumbling, all the incense in the box had been shattered.</p>

<h3>Recession</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>According to a friend in the Social Affairs Bureau, based on the nature of the labor disputes over the past year, they can be classified into four stages, and the current stage is the most dangerous.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the victory, workers demanded resumption of work one after another because the factories were reinstated. This was the first stage of the labor dispute. The factories resumed production, and the economic situation was good; later, workers demanded that wages be paid according to the cost-of-living index. This was the second stage of the labor dispute. There was a way out for the products, and the manufacturers had profits, so the workers made this demand, proving that the economic situation was also good; then, workers demanded an increase in base salary. This was the third stage of the labor dispute, and the economic situation was certainly not bad; but later, the manufacturers gradually became unsustainable, requesting closure or requesting a reduction in scope and personnel. The workers demanded guarantees that they would not be dismissed without cause. This was the fourth stage of the labor dispute, and its nature was different from the previous three stages. It indicated an economic recession, which is a crisis.</p>
<p>The National Federation of Industrial Associations and the Federation of Chambers of Commerce have both held conferences in Nanjing, providing the authorities with very specific countermeasures to the current industrial and commercial crisis. As the end of the year approaches, the financial situation will become more tense. We very much hope to get through this year peacefully, and seeing the gradual recovery of transportation in various places, perhaps our wish will not be in vain.</p>
<h3>"The Dangerous Liar"</h3>
<p>— Liǎo Rán (Understanding Clearly)</p>
<p>An "Excellent Article" in the English-language Da Mei Evening News</p>
<p>On October 31st, the English-language Da Mei Evening News published a letter from a reader entitled "Let's Organize the 'Get Out of China' Movement," the sender identifying himself as a "Former Friend of China." Its content went to the extreme in insulting China and the Chinese people. The letter began by mocking China's war against Japan, saying there were only defeats, no victories. Then it said that the supplies for rescuing China from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) were all embezzled. The Chinese people showed no gratitude for American aid. It also said that China had xenophobic laws and a corrupt judiciary. The Chinese only cared about their families, had no concept of the nation, no sympathy, no justice, no loyalty, and no dignity or mark to show that they were more advanced than beasts, and liked to mistreat animals… and so on. Therefore, he proposed to organize a "Get Out of China" movement, advocating that all foreigners withdraw from China, and that all transportation businesses, water and electricity companies, telephone companies, hospitals, buildings, asphalt roads, etc., run by foreigners in China, should all be removed from China. Furthermore, foreign countries should enact anti-Chinese laws so that Chinese people could not gain a foothold in foreign countries.</p>
<p>After this letter was published, the English-language Da Mei Evening News reprinted the original letter on November 2nd, and also wrote an editorial supporting the letter's arguments, saying that everything written in the letter was factual and deeply resonated with foreigners in China. As a result, foreign readers clamored to buy the newspaper that day in order to cut out the letter and send it back to their home countries. The newspaper had no choice but to reprint the original letter again, and hoped that readers would write in with their opinions, both for and against, etc. On November 4th, the newspaper published another letter from an American, signed "A Guest of China," scolding the one who called himself a "Former Friend of China" as a "Dangerous Liar," saying that everything said in his letter was untrue, did not represent the opinions of Americans, and donated 1,000 yuan for travel expenses, hoping that those who supported "Getting Out of China" would leave China as soon as possible. On November 5th, the newspaper published seven readers' letters on the issue on the entire third page. Three of the letters were written by foreigners and four were written by Chinese. They were all very long. The Chinese letters unanimously attacked the so-called "Get Out of China" movement and condemned the Da Mei Evening News for publishing the letter. Among the three letters from foreigners, one opposed "Getting Out of China" and two supported "Getting Out of China." Why did they support it? One did not explain the reason, and the other said that because he had returned to China and a petty thief had stolen a flute containing 12,000 U.S. dollars and other important documents, he felt that China was not what it used to be and foreigners should withdraw (this person wrote again on November 8th to correct himself, saying that what he opposed was only the chaotic state of China's post-war politics and economy, and that he did not agree with insulting the Chinese people, saying that Chinese people were the same as foreigners). On November 6th, the day the full text of the Sino-American commercial treaty was published, the newspaper still used the entire third page to publish letters about the issue. There were a total of eleven letters, three of which were written by foreigners, two of whom supported "Getting Out of China" and one of whom held opposing views. The remaining nine letters (from Chinese people) attacked the newspaper's editorial and the letter from the "Former Friend of China." On November 7th, the newspaper ended the incident with an editorial. The original position of the third page was used to publish the full text of the Sino-American commercial treaty. The editorial suddenly took a neutral stance, saying that every letter was written with sincerity, and some may have been written in blood. The conclusion was "Let the past be the past, and in the future, Chinese and foreigners should try to cooperate." However, this incident did not end. On November 8th, the newspaper had three more letters on the issue, two of which were written by Chinese people, attacking the newspaper for abusing friendship and insulting China, going beyond the normal bounds of freedom of speech. Although one letter written by a foreigner did not support "Getting Out of China," it considered Chinese people to be bad children who were "taught but not improved."</p>
<p>Chinese Readers' Reactions</p>
<p>The most touching thing was that on November 9th, the newspaper had three more letters from readers. The first letter was written by a Chinese person, who righteously and sternly blamed the newspaper for its inappropriate remarks and actions, saying that the Chinese government's tolerance of the incident was sufficient to prove that China was a democratic and free country, and that the people had tolerance.</p>
<p>Indian Sympathy</p>
<p>The second letter was written by "An Indian Friend," who pointed out that American goods were being dumped on the Chinese market in large quantities, and no country other than China could tolerate similar situations. Foreigners came to China not to do good deeds, but because they felt it was beneficial that they stayed in China. Americans also had an ugly side, and they could not arbitrarily criticize Chinese people.</p>
<p>Words from an American Woman</p>
<p>The third letter, judging from the signature and tone, was written by an American woman. She said that she had discussed this issue with many friends, and this letter was the result of the discussion. First, she apologized to the Chinese people on behalf of the American people, because one of her compatriots had insulted China and destroyed the code of conduct that civilized humans should follow. She believed that countries should not be criticized by the shortcomings of other countries. Didn't the United States also have bandits, crooked politicians, yellow publications, lynching parties, slick businessmen, unscrupulous lawyers, and quack doctors? Those who supported "Getting Out of China" had not objectively observed the facts or studied history. She and these people only had one opinion in common: that these foreigners should all get out of the country, but the so-called transportation facilities, etc., should remain in China, because the foreigners who created them had already recovered the profits and costs, and the remainder should belong to those who actually built them with blood, sweat, and labor. The Da Mei Evening News publishing this kind of letter was destroying the principle of "freedom of speech" and was of no benefit to the mutual understanding and mutual tolerance that the world urgently needed today.</p>
<p>A war of words ended here. The newspaper's all-day editorial revealed that the so-called "Former Friend of China" was a retired Air Force soldier. According to the newspaper, this war of words was beneficial to China. What was strange was that since the newspaper claimed that most foreigners supported "Getting Out of China," why were there so few letters from foreign readers, and one-third of the letters received were voting against it? However, no matter what the truth was, the Da Mei Evening News publishing that "excellent article" by the "Dangerous Liar" was abnormal. There must be no more such crazy and slanderous acts in the future! At the same time, after seeing the reactions of American readers to that "excellent article," we believe that most American friends are not satisfied with that excellent article!</p>
<h3>Relief Supplies</h3>
<p>— Yī Wěi (One Reed)</p>
<p>Indeed, this is good news for the disaster-stricken people. Batches of relief supplies are being transported in. Flour, soybean cakes, dried sweet potatoes, package after package, bag after bag, piled up like mountains. It is unknown how much time has passed, carried by vehicles and loaded on ships, before they finally arrive after many twists and turns. The disaster-stricken people now have a savior.</p>
<p>The Relief Association informs the county government, and the county informs the district, conducts investigations, and creates registers. After much time, it is reported to the county, and the county forwards it to the association.</p>
<p>Meetings are held, reports are made, discussions are conducted, and decisions are made on how to distribute the supplies! Decisions are made! Decisions are made! How to send personnel, how to transport them to the district, and how to distribute them.</p>
<p>Relief supplies arrive in the district. So much for a certain village, so much for a certain bao, so many jin of flour per person, so many pieces of cake, so many jin of dried sweet potatoes, to be collected on a certain date.</p>
<p>In this way, the refugees receive the supplies, open them, and take a look. How wonderful! The flour, fearing that the refugees will become inflamed from eating it, is specially the flour that has been stored for a very long time. The hateful bacteria have taken advantage of the situation to breed in the flour bags and become moldy. What about the soybean cakes? Fearing that the refugees' teeth will not be able to bite them, they are broken into pieces, piece by piece. What about the dried sweet potatoes? Each piece is as hard as a slate, and there is a frost-like powder scattered all over the ground. It turns out that the worms have already eaten their fill inside.</p>
<p>These are the relief supplies for the disaster-stricken people! This is the good news for the disaster-stricken people!</p>

<h3>"Phoenix Seeks Male"</h3>
<p>— Nánzǐ (Man)</p>
<p>Every year on November 9th, American women celebrate "Man-Chasing Day." On the squares of various universities, male students run around, and female students chase after them. The man who is caught should become friends with the woman who chased him. This day is the most joyous festival for single women. They can openly chase after the men they love. The dignity of women is completely abandoned, reversing the usual custom of men chasing women. Women are in the dominant position, chasing after the men they choose. During the event, men must run as hard as they can to avoid being caught by the women. Thus, the squares are filled with men and women, laughing and chasing each other. In the end, very few do not end up as couples.</p>
<p>The origin of this festival is as follows: Many years ago, there was a very ugly woman in the remote Dabashi area of the American West. Her name was Sadie. She was old but no man pursued her. So on her twentieth birthday, she said to her father: "Dad, I'm twenty years old today. Many women my age are already married. Why don't I have a boyfriend yet?" Her father said: "Maybe someone will propose to you. Just wait!" She waited for fifteen years, but poor Sadie still hadn't gotten married. Her father also became worried. In desperation, her father came up with a plan: On November 9th, her father called all the unmarried men in the village and said to them: "Boys, since none of you dare to marry my daughter, I have to take strict measures! I announce that today is 'Sadie Day'! When I fire the first shot, you must immediately start running—when I fire the second shot—Sadie—she's already let you go first—will start chasing you. Whoever she catches will be her husband! One, two, three, go!" So Sadie finally got her husband. Many other old maids heard about this and thought it was a very interesting idea, so they designated November 9th as "Sadie Day" and celebrated it once a year. Americans have always liked excitement and novelty, and this festival soon became popular throughout the United States.</p>
<p>Another reason for the widespread popularity of this festival is that the famous American cartoonist Al Capp introduced this local custom in his long-running cartoon "Lil Abner" with great fanfare. Because his cartoon had many readers, especially popular among young college students, this festival also became popular in universities. Every year when it is held, male and female students wear the same clothes as the male and female protagonists in the cartoon.</p>
<p>People in Shanghai have always liked to imitate Americans. I wonder if Chinese female college students also have the courage to hold this festival? (This article is written with reference to the English-language Da Mei Evening News of October 11th and American Life magazine.)</p>
<p>News Figure</p>
<h3>Hong Lanyou, the Busy Man Preparing for the National Assembly</h3>
<p>— Jǐnxiá (Brocade Clouds)</p>
<p>Amidst the calls for the National Assembly to convene, Mr. Hong Lanyou, the secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee, has become the busiest person among the important figures. Mr. Hong speaks with a Yangzhou accent. Those important figures and colleagues who meet and interact with Mr. Hong day and night mostly think he is from Jiangdu, but in fact, Mr. Hong is originally from Huixian County, Anhui, but has been registered in Jiangdu for a long time. Mr. Hong is only forty-four years old this year, but he has already become a popular figure in the political world. His political life can indeed be described as "smooth sailing." Because as recently as the "Who's Who in Contemporary China" published in June 1931, Mr. Hong's name was not yet included.</p>
<p>Before entering the political world, Mr. Hong practiced as a lawyer in Shanghai in 1925, but not under his current name. Mr. Hong graduated from the Law Department of Aurora University and once served as a professor at the Central Political School. He is the author of two books, "General Theory of Jurisprudence" and "Outline of Chinese Legal History."</p>
<p>When Mr. Zhang Daofan was the Secretary-General of the Capital Municipal Government, he appointed Mr. Hong as his secretary. Mr. Hong's entry into the political world was originally due to Mr. Zhang's recommendation, but Hong was a natural political talent and was successively trusted and appreciated by Mr. Chen Lifu and Mr. Ju Juesheng. From then on, he rose steadily and greatly realized his ambitions.</p>
<p>Mr. Hong's father has passed away. He lived in Yangzhou and was happy to do good deeds and give generously. He participated in all local public welfare projects. Mentioning "Grand Philanthropist Hong" was well-known far and wide. Mr. Hong also has the legacy of his predecessors. He is currently the Vice Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Social Affairs. For social welfare undertakings, he is naturally able to achieve remarkable results and carry forward the legacy of his predecessors, as we expect.</p>
<p>Mr. Hong is a busy man. Most of his free time is spent reading. He often has a book in his hand. Apart from reading, it can be said that he has no other hobbies.</p>
<p>If you do not have a deep friendship with Mr. Hong, you will not know whether he is from Jiangdu or Anhui. However, according to the author, Mr. Hong's original residence is indeed Shexian County, Anhui.</p>
<p>A Story by a Psychoanalyst</p>
<h3>The Innocent Murderer 2</h3>
<p>— Xǔ Guītíng (Xu Guiting)</p>
<p>Mrs. Lusson paused slightly, then continued, "After Adam came back, everything was fine. His leg gradually recovered. It didn't even matter when he was dancing. He was obviously very happy. Unexpectedly, after returning home from the first dance that night, I went to bed first because I was tired. When I suddenly woke up, Adam was actually holding my neck with both hands, looking very ugly. At that time, I knew that something was wrong. I couldn't resist a man of such a sturdy build. I had no choice but to resign myself to fate and reluctantly smiled. At least he thought I smiled. He immediately let go of his hand and said to me: You're actually smiling! I coughed for a long time and replied: Did I smile? Why would I smile? He suddenly burst into tears. That's how things ended."</p>
<p>"But things didn't end that easily. Since that time, his whole person seemed to have collapsed. He often suffered from insomnia and often drank alcohol, which he had never done before. Once on the balcony, he suddenly showed a ferocious face and gripped my body tightly. I knew that his desire for sex was about to flare up again, so I smiled at him and said, "Calm down, my love! Don't do those things that you don't want your mother to know." After hearing this, he looked at me, seemed ashamed, and laughed heartily. So the two of us laughed for a while, and that's how we ended another terrible encounter. This is definitely not a joke. I hope you can help him."</p>
<p>Mi En sat in silence for a long time, then said, "I certainly want to help you, but I must warn you that you are taking a great risk by continuing to live with him."</p>
<p>Mrs. Lusson replied, "If I don't stay with him, he may be even more unhappy. Since he was able to drag his crippled leg all the way through the forest area back to me, I believe that I can never leave him just to risk a sore throat."</p>
<p>Mi En then asked, "Has he come to see me here?"</p>
<p>"Probably."</p>
<p>"Then, how about next Monday?"</p>
<p>The appointment for Lusson to come to Mi En's clinic was at 11:00 a.m., but he didn't arrive until fifteen minutes later. He didn't arrive until 11:30. Lusson was a large man with a slight limp in one leg. He was wearing a sports coat and flannel pants. Mi En went up to greet him. In his conversation, he always expressed thoughts of being tired of the world. Mi En did his best to persuade him to come for one-hour talks three times a week. Lusson said, "Very well, but I want to state in advance that I don't have the money to pay for your consultation fee." Mi En said, "Let's discuss it again." Lusson then walked away. Twenty minutes later, he ran back and said to Mi En, "Hey! Do you know what? I almost murdered my wife once. Maybe she's afraid I'll do it again and be sentenced to hanging."</p>
<p>"Then why don't you murder her?"</p>
<p>Lusson frowned and replied, "It's really strange, even I can't figure it out. It's like something is stopping me from doing that, so I gave up. This thing is really stupid, and I can't remember all the details. I thought you should know."</p>
<p>"Well, yes," Mi En replied, "I think this thing is very important."</p>
<p>Lusson said "Goodbye" and ran away.</p>
