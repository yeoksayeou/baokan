<p>政府代表張治中致詞：「今日政府代表與中共代表及馬歇爾顧問所組成之軍事小組會議簽訂關於軍隊整編及統編中共部隊爲國軍之基本方案，意義甚爲重大，衆所週知。政府與中共對立達十八年之久，在此期間，爲中共問題內戰問題，不知犧牲多少人才，消耗多少國家元氣與躭擱多少建設。今日此一方案之簽訂，可謂結束了十八年之糾紛與對立，吾人今後一定拋棄以武器作爲戰爭之工具，而進入新的和平時代，我國人民所期望之和平統一民主團結之國家，將可實現，且在此文件上，已獲得保障。政協成功，乃在達成政治民主化之日標，此一文件則將奠定軍隊國家化之基礎，今後我國當可本和平建設之大方針，以建設三民主義之新中國，本人代表政府簽此方案，並百分之百保證其執行，使達成逐步軍隊國家化之目的。此次會議能有如此良好結果，應歸功於偉大之友人馬歇爾將軍，謹致誠懇之感謝與崇高之敬意」。</p>

<p>馬歇爾致詞</p>
<p>馬歇爾特使致詞，譯文「這協定代表中國的希望，我祗有信賴它的册頁不致被少數不妥協分子所沾汚，這些少數份子，爲了自私的目的，可能使熱望謀取在和平與繁榮中生活的權利之中國人民遭受挫敗」。</p>

<h3>原子彈試騐程序確定　在比基尼參觀者僅一自動記錄之機器人</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕據悉：比基尼珊瑚島原子彈試騐之程序如下：第一次炸彈在停泊之目標艦上面數百呎處爆炸。第二次炸彈在永平面爆炸，將敵起海潮，高達百呎，預料可致最大之損壞。第三次炸彈在水內數千呎處爆炸，壓力將使船身內陷。此項特殊裝置之炸彈尚在計劃期內，不能於初時立即使用，恐將使作爲試騐目標之艦船全部破壞。此項深水試騐，預料將在水面發生猛烈之沸騰，當於距離有人烟之海岸，商船航路及捕魚區域甚遠之深水處實行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社比基尼珊瑚島廿四日電〕原子炸彈實騐將於五月間在此問近海舉行，屆時在島上參觀者僅自動記錄之機器人而已。海軍工程部隊不久將在此島開始建造水泥高塔，四壁均襯以鉛層，俾安置照相機及科學儀器。島上土人數日內即須棄家移居鄰近之郞奇立克島，但顯然並未因此懷恨。島上僅有椰子樹，少數麵包樹及芋類植物，有小屋若干係露兜木所造，包括「官舍」及敎堂各一。島民在如是簡單之生活環境中，能保特其堅强身軀，誠一異事。土民均友善和氣，除兒童外，均衣着齊全，此係傳敎士敎導之功。土民已迅速獲知美幣價値，各物論價，輒以美金計算。一俠島民遷徙完畢，工程隊即將在此長二哩半闊一哩半之島嶼進行原子彈實騐之種種準備。</p>

<h3>充滿北方風味的江南都市　徐州生活橫斷面</h3>
<p>— 特派員姜　軍</p>
<p>本報徐州廿一日航訊</p>
<p>這是個近代北的都市。</p>
<p>縱橫在市區內的幾條馬路，兩側巨　　立。寬敞的馬路中天，點綴着長圓形的花圃，每一個乍到徐州的旅客，誰都會對它頷首禮　：徐州是一個近代化的都市。是的，徐州正走向近代都市的道路，這里有　髮脂香的摩登女郞，流綫型的小轎車，有影院，有舞廳，還有最新式的都市設備。然而表面不能代表實質。徐州眞正的面目，和中國大多數城鎭一樣，仍是徘徊在幾十年以前的時代。</p>
<p>阿Q在徐州</p>
<p>學時髦</p>
<p>儘　在街上牛軍獨輪車通行」的木牌，老態龍鍾的牛車，依然視若無睹，招搖過市。獨輪小車軋軋之聲，日以繼夜，絡繹不絕。眞正當地的姑娘，是一副樸素的「二道毛」，上下一般粗的旗袍，露出一大截臃腫的長脚棉褲，毫無曲綫可言。</p>
<p>影院是少數人消遣的場所。一般平民的娛樂方式，不是在書寓聽淸唱，便是去欣賞河南梆子　。綏靖主任官邸的水汀設備，祇此一家，並無分出。百分之九十五的人民，仍是棲息在我們列祖列宗遺傳下來的東方式建築中。至於舞廳，說來給上海人聰了，眞是一個大笑話：千萬不要想像那打臘的地板，這里的舞池只是普通水泥地面，跳上幾個回合，灰沙隨舞盤旋，旣陋且俗的軍樂，漢成了一切伴奏。三名舞伴之中，來自馬戲班客串的女郞，往往居其二。來自妓院者也不在少數。半城半鄉的女學生，不讓專美，三五成羣，列座「見習」。觀衆超出座上客，簇擁門檻內外，　着雙眼，爭看這「外國把戲」。形形色色的舞客：飛將軍，丘八爺，鄕巴佬，洋洋乎，嘆爲觀止。這好有一比：「阿Q」學時髦，不澈底。</p>
<p>城東卅裏外</p>
<p>戒備嚴</p>
<p>勝利的消息，傳來已是六個月了，可是，截至目前止，徐州還是昔日的徐州，一切都沒有復員，依然帶着戰時殘餘的情調。徐州以東三十里外的地區，即是中共控制的「解放區」，碉堡工事，戒備森嚴。常局爲防衛地方治安，入夜十一時以後，徐州市區即行宵禁。更深人靜，萬籟無聲，在安靜中　得寂寞，在寂寞中彷彿令人呼吸到可怖的炎藥氣味。</p>
<p>在白天，大街小巷，彳亍着各個番號不同的軍人。在廣塲上，淸晨時分，士兵們孜孜於戰鬥的操練；在三民主義靑年團銅山分關部的洋房里，「新四軍」和「八路軍」背章的共產黨兵員，融洽地和中央憲兵同志，生活在一起。這一切，給人們的心頭時時掠上些目前採不去的暗雲。</p>
<p>風物與人情</p>
<p>北方味</p>
<p>徐州人情風物，一切都帶着北方味燥，風大，灰塵多，因此，汽車階級在徐州，特別顯得威風凜凜，車輪過處，灰塵昻揚，行人如墮重霧。</p>
<p>徐州人性格，乾脆，率直。記者曾經好幾次碰到地們提出這樣的疑問：「政府和共產黨究竟談判到怎樣程度？打就打，和就和，爲什麼老這樣含糊不淸？」這個問題的提出。雖然不免多少含有點稚氣，但很顯然的，他們在關心國事之中，正希望着眞正和平日子的到來！</p>
<p>由於一般市民關切政局的發展，報紙在徐州的銷路並不壞，特別是上海的申報和大公報，很受讀者的做迎。</p>
<p>共同苦悶感</p>
<p>無新聞</p>
<p>本地出版有中報和徐報兩家，內容印刷，均屬下乘。徐報係民國十八年創刋，歷史較爲悠久，社長是一位高齡七十三歲的老夫子，精神很好，自稱辦報是外行。活動在徐州的本外埠記者，凡十餘人，他們都有着一致的苦悶：徐州是一個沒有新聞的地方。軍事調處的新聞，雖然在政治協商會上明文規定自由採訪，可是，徐州的有關當局，認爲職責攸關，守口如瓶，記者們簡直無法「開刀」。</p>
<p>物價步步高陛，利軍事衝突調處一採，越來越玄妙。如今，徐州一般物價的指敎，較之京滬一帶，竟已高高居上。人們生活在「不得了一的圈子里。</p>
<p>仕女覺一宿</p>
<p>打地舖</p>
<p>當記者初到時，徐州正鬧着普遍的房荒。據調整房屋的負責人說：徐州人口現近三十萬，較戰前超出幾有二倍，是房荒的一個原因，但，主要的癥結，不是患在房子數量不數而患在分配不均。封存敵僞的房產，迄今猶擱置不動。多數巨樓大厦，大門外站守一名武裝同志，屋內却　無一人者，比比皆是。這一種矛盾現象，當局刻正着手整頓。目前徐州的上等旅館，大多由軍事機關全部或一部徵用，軍政官員及其眷屬，常川寄寓，是以行旅客商，若不是經過「官」的路綫，休想問津。在徐州，衣冠楚楚的仕女，臨時在旅館開地舖，並不是一件希罕的事。</p>
<p>徐州酒味醉，不傷腦筋，然而，據熟悉地方情形者說：女人比酒更迷人。徐州有一個者名的銷魂窟，名字呌做「金谷里」。金谷里彷彿廣西的特察里，屋舍建築，整齊雅觀，規模較小，情趣別緻，這裏有二十餘家之多，每家擁有商女數十名，生涯尙稱不惡。歸納一下：徐州的正常狀態，正有待於迅速確立。</p>
<h3>昆明近情</h3>
<p>昆明不景氣後出現的另一厄運，失業許多年來第一次成爲昆市民生中一項重要事件。事實上，在抗戰期問，勞力很感缺乏，特別在熟練技術工人方面，格外缺乏。日寇投降後，這種情形已作一百八十度的反向，大批工人反而無工可做。上年十一月杪，省政府某發言人說：那時候失業人數約有五萬人。但據消息靈通和有資格方面估計，恐還不止此數。今年正月間，調查戶口，昆明市共有居民三十萬人。如果這數字是正確的，那末至少在六人中已有一人失業。</p>
<p>人們常談起政府貸款給各工廠，帮助他們渡過這過渡時期的話。當地工業界人士，雖然向政府提出緊急請願，但到目下爲止，他們還沒有得到實際的救濟。不但如此，還應說政府決定剏設「托辣斯」式的國營工業，（例如中國紡織公司一類的組織，此項消息，巳在當地工業界中引起頗堪注目的不安和恐慌情勢。（譯自二月號密勒氏訐論報。）</p>
<h3>鹽政改革管見　（績完）</h3>
<p>— 徐爾信</p>
<p>各塲產鹽由國營之鹽業公司統籌配運濟銷，實際上售銷於食戶者，則爲經然之商號。是項經售食鹽之商號，向鹽業公可　發售，必須先向主管之鹽務行政機關申請領照手續，經核准許可以後，取具殷實補保，並繳納保證金，方准營業。在營業期間，須備置各項簿册，翔實登載。以備查考。並須有存鹽之完備食棧，以供主管官署隨時查倉，而免經售私鹽，所有購進售去存倉之鹽量，均須按日塡表登記。各商號應照規定牌價售鹽，不得擅自增價，亦不得有尅扣斤兩，及　和泥沙等情事，並須將鹽樣陳列店肆公開易見之處。至肩挑商販，挑赴各鄕村銷售者，並應登記給證，取其殷實舖保，方准營業。所有批購經售之鹽，立　分別登記，藉備隨時查核。其經銷之路綫村鎮地方，均須明白規定，非經指定之地方，不得挑販，以杜流弊。是項商販，可以自由串請經售，任何人不受限制，人民亦可自由向之購買。</p>
<p>整頓緝私</p>
<p>我國鹽稅稅率較重，以致私鹽充斥，官鹽滯銷，因賴緝私以保稅。歷代法禁嚴密，律令滋繁，雖巡緝兵弁，棋佈星羅，捕緝愈嚴，私鹽愈多，蓋以大利所在，人爭機之。不僅緝私部隊，徒有其表，未能盡責，甚或以放私護私爲能事，更有自行運私者，辦理旣未能盡善，對於緝私保稅，成效殊鮮。近數年來，經財政當局銳意整頓，私鹽日見减少，裨益殊宏。此後緝私事務，宜劃一職權，統一辦理，樹立健全之機構，發揮切實之效能。並應着重塲區之查緝，塲不漏私，私無以生。在各塲區域以內，按照其幅員廣州狹，配置相當兵力，負往來巡查之責，更須於交通要道，派隊駐守，隨時查察，暨實行圍塲截堵。近海口岸，私鹽最易出沒，須備置巡船或淺水兵輪，不時梭巡以杜走漏。至產銷交界水陸要隘，須常川設置巡卡，實行查騐截堵。此外按照規定之運輸綫，配備兵力，分別佈置緝私錢，以防私鹽運入銷岸，感官　夾帶私貨。至銷岸之查緝事務，似以責由地方政府辦理，較易奏效，即當地之警察團隊，應負有查緝私　之責。所有緝獲之功　，變價後，除應捉稅欵外，全部撥充在事出力人員獎勵之用，並須另給獎金，以示鼓勵。此外在塲區應責令鹽民編組保甲，使　戶互相聯保，各自稽察，實行運坐。如有私開新　，擅增晒板，秘密前　，藏匿餘鹽，實行漏私，或串通私販等等，鄰戶應據實首吿，倘容　不報，一經查實，併　　坐，此項產地查緝，事前防範，實爲正本淸源之緝私辦法。</p>
<p>是項官專賣制之方式，由國營之鹽業公司負專賣業務之責，雖與自由買賣制不同，但並非全部專賣，而係有計劃的統制，有限制的自由之制。如任鹽戶自由製產，與銷岸任商號自由經售，同時其產製成本高昻，零星不便管理之塲區，則予以廢除封閉，秘密製產者，則嚴予取締。商號經售。則須登記領照，並須在指定地區與路綫以內經營，而隨時受主管鹽務行政機關之管理。一面對鹽之產製收買運儲銷售，採取有計劃的統制，寓有計劃經濟與目由經濟並重，國營企業與民營企業兼顧之意，即以計劃經濟，發展國營事業，藉期達到資本國家化，享受大衆化之目的，深信與我國戰後應採取之經濟建設原則不違反。惟於鹽法規定就塲徽稅任人民自由買賣之制，未盡符合，但在目前塲產未能嚴密管理以前，而　稅稅率一時又未能减低，則一稅之後，任其所之之自由買賣制，流弊殊多。是項官專賣制，於鹽業公司就赴場配運時，即照規定稅率先行繳稅，即等於塲征稅，而由　業公司統　配運濟銷，仍由各地商號負自由銷售之責，各食戶亦可自由購食，不受限期，而係有限制之自由買賣制。一俟塲產整頓與管理已臻嚴密完備，與夫自由買賣之客觀條件具備，私鹽有把握可以杜絕，彼時依照鹽法規定實行就塲征稅自由買賣之制並不爲遲。</p>

<h3>社論　東北問題乃國際問題</h3>
<p>這幾天來，東北問題已漸成爲全世界人士最屬目之問題。東北問題，在本質上，在形勢上，均已成爲國際問題。</p>
<p>陪都學生，爲了東北問題遊行請願面後，各地聞風繼起。上海全市學生昨旣罷課宣傳，今日聞將更有大規模之遊行，表示其愛國護權之熱忱。不獨學生爲然，亦不獨上海一市爲然。蓋東北爲中國之生命綫，東北之完整，即爲中國之完整。收復東北，向九一八以來，十五年問，爲中國人民一致之願望。今抗戰勝利，已逾半年，而接收東北，挫折如斯，任何人對外侮之嚴重，內奸之糾擾，不能無所感覺。人窮則反本，疾　惻怛則呼父母，乃情理之常。故羣衆示威，要求政府嚴正交涉，勿再姑息讓步，亦爲任何國家愛國民衆司空見慣之常事。不料蘇聯電台廣播，竟指此爲「反動份子」之反蘇活動政府已爲中國提出抗議。我們眞不知蘇聯友邦人士，如果易地以皮，究將作何感想。</p>
<p>小待我們誇張，中國總是一個最愛好和平的國家。自年來中國飽受侵略是事實，今天中國要從侵略壓迫中力求解放也是事實。蘇聯在中國抗戰初期的種種援叻，中國人次不會忘記的，這更是事實。只要看中國雖同爲戰勝國家，同爲四强之一，而願　意簽訂中蘇同盟友好　　，相期保持遠東和平至少三十年，不惜承認外蒙獨立，承認東北鐵路之共營，承認旅大之租借，一若中國爲一戰敗國者，亦不過爾爾，而中國不顧也，則中國對蘇友好之誠意，宜可與天下人以共見。我們縱不談雅爾達之秘密協定，但中蘇同盟友好條約，旣爲雙方所同意，自應爲雙方所共守。而中蘇盟約則爲此一年中國際問最所重視之信約，因爲它右關於貢獻世界和平者獨多。此的而可背盟，而可不守，則國際間更何有道義可講，有何條約可言？而聯合國機構之組織，安全理事會之成立，又豈非均爲多事？故率直言之，中國之東北問題，在今天實已不僅是中國問題，也不祇是中蘇問題，而是牽涉整個世界的國際問題了。國際問題祇有國際解次。所以我們論東北問題時，首須看淸這一點，堅次反對濫用國內黨派協商的政治解次方法來企圖解次東北問題。否則必陷治絲愈紊的窘境，而貽國家以無窮的後患。</p>
<p>東北問題的發生，演變，及其發展到現階段的態勢，次不祇是中蘇問兩國有關的問題，始終是一個國際問題。站在中國人的立場，我們固不願見在我們自己的領土內有像這樣的一個國際問題，但這問題却最先就是以國際問題的態勢出現着的。本來，中國於蘆溝橋事變後，對日全面抗戰，其目的便在確保我們領土與主權的完箏。日本打敗，中國收回東北，便不會再有什麼東北問題，更不再會有像目前出現在東北的那樣具有國際意味的問題。現在東北局勢之所以發展到目前地步，本不由於我們的自主，而是國際關係上所謂「權力政治」復活的原故。擎潰「權力政治」原是對軸心作戰的目的，不料在進行對軸心作戰的時候，「權力政治」却又重復暗中抬起頭來—這表現於雅爾達的秘密協定，像表現於聯合國的憲章上一樣。</p>
<p>惟其有雅爾達協定，所以東北局勢總有像目今這樣的展開。中國不是雅爾達協定的參加者，在理論上，絕不受雅爾達協定的拘束；但作爲中蘇新關係之基石的中蘇友好同盟條約，其中所成立的協定，不待明言，原是上承雅爾達的綫索而　成立的。在雅爾達協定內，故羅斯福總統担負起使中國接受雅爾達協定的義務。中國是在我們的盟邦美國的敦促之下，纔與我們的另一盟邦蘇聯締結了中蘇友好條約，爲了維持世界和平之故，以壯士斷臂的情緒作了最大的讓步。我們信任我們的盟邦，滿期在作了最大讓步之後，必能達成我們重國東北的願　。東北局勢發展到現階段，參加雅爾達協定的國家應負其全責。而雅爾達會議之所以有此秘密協定，顯然的由於蘇聯挾參戰爲要求，以強迫英美之出此。故現在東北局勢的產生，蘇聯爲原始之蓄意者，自無足怪，而其禍很乃肇端於雅爾達。是參加雅爾達會齜之美英兩國，對澄淸現有東北局勢，在道義上實不容推卸其責任！</p>
<p>現在柬北的局勢，不僅是中國未能展開接收的工作，其中主要的締結，歸納言之，有如下列：（一）所謂「戰利品」的間題。「戰利品」一詞，苦取廣義的解釋，那將無所不包；（二）所謂「走廊」及「新疆土」的問是，這顯與中國領土及主權完整之義相背；（三）在蘇軍佔領區內製造並發展與中國國民政府利益相抵觸的局勢，冀　爲「旣成事實」，由一個本身是國際間題演變成一個在表面上像是內政問題。至於什麼「經濟合作」云云，那尤其使我們回想到當年廣田所提的要求，此在中國人民心中，自有一番感觸。現在東北發展着的局勢特別令人感到煩憂的，就是離心分化運動。「東蒙人民共和國」可不必說，此外在東北還發展著所謂「人民武裝部隊」與中國共產黨軍相呼應，而阻撓我國軍的推進。凡此種種，都與斷肩戰的盟邦所以共同抵抗軸心之原旨相背，尤其與中國之所以苦戰八年，堅拒日寇　和之目的相反。聯合國如不願重蹈舊國聯之　轍，爲確保世界之安全許，對此東北問題，在今天實已應毅然負起公正解決之責任。美國務卿貝爾納斯前言聲述，東北接收問題將提遠東顧問委員會解次，其觀點或與吾人所見相同，而美國自覺其在雅爾達會議之失着，要亦可　知其一二。</p>
<p>本報前論東北局勢，曾謂：「關於東北地方之協定」，係由中國國民政府與蘇聯政府所訂立，在國民政府權力未會到達東北以前，蘇聯營局負有將整個東北移交給國民政府接管之條約義務；則在防區以內，產生及發展與國民政府利益相牴觸的任何局勢，蘇聯理難放任不顧。」東北何以會右所謂「人民武裝部隊」出現？何以蘇聯當局不加制止？何以中國共產黨的宣傳要特別强調道一點希望將它化成內政問題？無疑的，中國共產黨做了蘇聯的傀儡，而蘇聯在東北却正培植它的傀儡勢力。本報於同一社論中，又謂：「美國前副總統華萊士於年前來華時曾說，中蘇兩國邊界之長，惟美國與加拿大之邊界堪與比擬，希望中蘇邊界與美加邊界一樣足以增進兩國間的了解和合作。我們也眞願這綿長的國界，確能做到像美加問的國界一樣。」本報對於我們盟邦蘇聯的睦誼，向極珍視，於此可見，但亦惟其珍視，故更不能不對目前發展的局勢，特別率直指出其關鍵，而希望蘇聯之改善態度。</p>
<p>東北問題的遷延不決，會引起我們所不願想像的後果。門戶開放政策的重申，雖泛泛地表明了我們盟邦的態度，但現在的東北問題已不是一個門戶開放政策的重申所能解決的問題。這起因於雅爾達。這是需要國際協力纔能解決的問題！現在就是需要行動的時候。我們不可大家近視，只圖苟安旦夕，再學一些英國前外相西門的乖，但事敷衍，而使里星之火終於燎原。我們要提醒美國盟邦，不可忘記那些死在太平洋荒島上，中國的廣原上，和歐洲及非洲的不可數計的，他們的爲國犧牲的兒女們！</p>
<p>德之，東北問題是國問題，國際不能公正解決東北問題，則東北問題必終將爲害於國際和平！</p>
<p>「原子時代」的進程</p>
<p>不許讓「野馬」阻撓！</p>

<p>續訊：交大愛國遝動學生代表會，昨晚發表緊急聲明，略謂廿五日中午上海市學生護權運動大會之鉛印宣言發表，其中與前商定之詞句有出入，斯與吾人之立塲有所不合，且報載上海市護權運動大會吿全國同胞書，係交大同學所擬，亦不屬實，故宣布退出上海市學生護權運動大會並重申吾人純正國民愛國之立塲，若來自任何立塲之批評，吾國立交通大學全體同學必予以國民愛國嚴正立塲之抨擊。</p>

<h3>物價昨普遍下瀉　當局緊急措置收效　採米貸款暫定二十億元</h3>
<p>自當局作有效措置，抑平物價以來，昨晨棉紗布疋及黑市黃金等，均作普遍下跌趨勢，米價開盤最高兩萬六千，迄至收場，並未上漲，已較上週杪平均下跌二三千元。其切實原因，乃係糧政當局舉辦米商貸欵，及昨日各牌麵粉驟低二三百元一袋之故。</p>
<p>採米貸款擬訂草案</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據楊特派員吿記者，本市之米店，迄已增加至一千六百餘家，米行亦已增加至三百餘家。一般糧商，以囿於資金關係，故米價愈漲，愈扳貨居奇，以防售出後，不能照原價補進，今糧政處即擬以貸欵方式補救，使於糧價飛漲時，仍能源源供售，而一方面則仍有充份資金，向產區補購。記者復叩以政府徵收軍糧之事，據吿徵收軍糧，二月前已將全部手續辦理淸楚，目前如有收糧之事，當係徵集已定之軍糧。據估計全部軍糧，佔江浙產量不足百分之一二，次不致影響糧源之供應。</p>
<p>（又訊）糧政常局昨晨續召集本市米商，商討貸欵採米方法，直至中午方散，聞其草案，業經繕定，一俟核准，即行公佈。又據確悉，此次貸欵，以本市豆米行業公會領有會員證爲合格，貸欵總額，暫定國幣二十億元，需要時，並再可增加。利息以國家銀行貸欵利息按日結算，擔保得用銀錢業·商舖·糧商各書面擔保。貸欵數額，以當時米價折合國幣，少則五百石，多則二千石，米糧應存倉庫，依照指定機構，該貨應售予本市。又聞此辦法一俟通過後，糧政當局再擬談本市行政機關，組織一審查委員會，以充實一切，如此有效實施，米價前途，不難逐日下降。</p>
<h3>保險公會改選</h3>

<h3>有車階級可安心　汽油無限制供應</h3>

<p>致政府電</p>
<p>又通過致政府電文稱：國民政府主席蔣鈞盬，竊念全民八載苦戰，主席領導羣倫，宵　勤勞，求民族之自由，奠國家於獨立，今天日重光，河山再造，故東北之領土與主權，必須維護其完整，對於蘇聯之折衝，不容於中蘇條約外再有讓步，完成國父自由平等之遺訓，樹立百年建國之宏基，非然者，十四年的淚，八年的血，將付東流，勝利成果，化爲烏有，其將何以上對先烈，下對子孫。本會集合愛好自由人士，爲爭取自由擁贊民主而組織，今日成立，特電呼籲，敬祈睿鑒，並向主席致最高敬禮。自由協會叩迥。</p>

<h3>金鈔證券　同時告疲落　黃金跌至一六〇萬</h3>
<p>烚赤昨因平津金價遭查禁而慘跌，以有所盛傳之某方收羅黃金說，漸歸平淡，晨開即降爲一七二萬，開後並傳當局有命銀樓限一四萬將存底兌出之謠，竟跌至一六〇萬，美鈔因商輪進口，結款浩大，由疲轉堅，命市得其助力，逢低吸收者轉殷，漸見起色，午刻突見回漲，在一七五萬左右盤旋，較上週六微挫，午後微現不支，喊價略小，交易已吿閑散，飾金仍無掛牌，紋銀二千元，銀元來源忽多，曾退至九百元關邊，最後千元有供給，暗拆仍自一角八分至二角三分。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔上場極疲，低價進口結款殷勤，由平轉穩，晨初即退至二五三〇元有賣，一度跌至二四二〇元，此後維持有人，漸漸回好，午刻曾迫近二六〇〇元大關而後稍回，結果與上週六相彷彿，港票低後轉呈盤局，結果較上週六計老貨跌十元，新貨跌十五元，此乃老貨有法定價値，印棉結款可以套轉運用之故。</p>
<p>公債及華洋股票，因同業公會旣吿成立，已向常局請求設立公開市場，業中均靜待正當合法之發展而乏活動，並無正式成交，僅少數讓受，丙種步降至一七〇〇元光景，其他亦被帶小。</p>
<p>華股之經營者，雖有公開交易之要求，然晨證券交易所有於交易所停業期間，嚴禁塲外交易之通吿，人心益吿不支，永安紗廠初喊二千四百元，美亞二千，景福一百四十元，午刻時喊價再較昨軋低，游學交易，成交極少。</p>
<p>外股交易益形寥寂，持股者旣不願低價脫手，求股者又難找對象，結果各價與昨相彷彿，惟大勢似賣多於買，市况穩中帶軟。</p>
<h3>米麵均回小　油價跌五六千元</h3>
<p>昨日米市，河下來源路多，店方納胃轉懈，供過於求，白粳猛挫二千元，早薄稻猛跌二三千元，杜子亦在小三千餘元，白元及洋秈降二千餘元，油市以靑島續有來源，再跌五六千元，麵粉仍有江河日下之勢，續小五六百元，黃豆再跌二千元左右，豆餅跟小三百元，麩皮亦回小五六百元，惟生仁尙稱挺秀，各糧以人心軟化，一致下瀉。</p>
<h3>新祁門上市　每坦廿一萬五千</h3>
<p>安徽祁門所產之紅茶，「色」「香」「味」三者均佳，當敵僞盤踞時，　運艱難，雖經業中人設法轉　裝滬，大都係陳久多年之貨，品實不　變化，犬日重光後，各路交通次第復常，故新貨祁門茶亦能相見，日來由震和茶棧絡繹售出近百件，價每祖爲二十一萬五千元，比前尙無　輊，而因品質參差，故大有明定暗挺之勢，其他花色，値此新貨尙未登塲，陳貨幾將吿罄之際，各方人心均看俏。</p>
<h3>絲綢交易清淡</h3>
<p>昨市絲綢一致軟弱，人造絲一二號大橋現貨上午賣出二百二十五萬元，買進二百二十萬元，午後曾做廿八萬至三十萬元，最後又回小，做上午原價，棧單無市，廠絲亦疲軟，上身五祖頭成交價二百五十五萬元，各檔較上日短五萬元之譜，干經平穩，綢貨隨原料同時疲洛，交易淸淡，美亞被面較上週末做低七萬五千元，大誠格　縐做小一百元弱，洪康黑白縐及林記蠟羽紗，售價無甚榮辱。</p>
<h3>呢絨客銷暢盛</h3>
<p>呢羢毛織品邇日客銷頗盛，川滇黔與華北帮湘鄂贛與南京蕪湖杭州帮，咸有進胃，然均限於高檔細毛貨，男女色齊有成交，十之八九均皆指選國產本廠出品，尤以章華寅豐協新三牌子之貨最爲需要。</p>
<h3>紗花布轉疲　紡建售盤亦略低</h3>
<p>昨日紗市相當穩定其過程與上週六始疲終堅同出一轍，晨初人心殊軟，十六支光明一度降至九十三萬，旋以同行競相吸買，價復冉冉上升，迄十二時，以當日之高價一百零二萬收盤，其餘粗細紗無不先跌復回，結果與上週末價無甚榮辱，趨勢可稱稱中帶秀，紡建公司昨屆售紗例期，價較上期略低數萬，四十二支雙股仙桃已見供售，衆料本週雙綫之需要，或因是而稍得抑平焉。</p>
<p>昨日現棉交易愈暢，仍以紡建公司採辦爲濃，曾進美棉四十二支原料米特林五六百件，又大中集花二百件，又三餘鎭花亦成交二百件，全係送廠價，花號互做周浦籽化一二百担，此外民營紗廠仍懷觀望，未有舉動。價見昂三四千元。</p>
<p>棉布交易稀疏，客帮逢高吐售，中檔棉布各跌三四千元。色布欲漲乏萬，染色貨之成本，以燃料節節上漲，自前所開廠盤，大半爲此所佔，煤斤運輸不便利，染織廠不能减輕成本也。</p>
<h3>木材穩中帶軟</h3>
<p>昨木材市况，穩中帶軟，市價參差不一，大部份賣方鑒金融性物價已跌，頗具寒心，暗中吐售，惟尙有一部份堅不吐出，繼續看好。</p>
<h3>燃料市面大混亂</h3>
<p>煤漲漫無止境　柴炭同被帶高</p>
<p>煤市　自本月初旬，得上海區燃料管理委員會令，商人向外埠採辦運輸煤斤，須得該會核准，不得私自辦理以來，滬地到煤頓見銳减，全賴少量存貨維持，是以價格方而，貨主喊價漫無止境，進戶還價難以接近，鮮有正式成交。</p>
<p>柴炭　受煤價猛烈上漲，銷路漸有開展，更有柴炭同業乘機　價，行情迅速進展。黃岩鋼炭每担一萬零五百元高價有成交，河溪江炭九千五百，簍子杭炭八千五百元，栗柴更爲缺貨，雜柴二千九百元，松柴二千六百元，零有劈好棵柴數船，每棵一百廿元，一百五十元及一百八十元，每重棵四斤至五六斤不等。</p>

<p>週六爲靑百對龍傑，後者在初賽中擊退英海軍，聲勢不弱，但無多大能爲，此次遇勁旅靑白，自難免遭受淘汰。</p>
<p>週末爲義僑與永安，義僑必勝無疑，東華與初賽中克服印度之蘇聯交綏，聞蘇聯或將整飭陣容，唯以東華之强，正不必有所畏　也。另一塲係猶太鬥韓僑，則尤爲可觀之一役。本週全部秩序錄下：</p>

<h3>汕隊主將缺席　慘遭巨人毒手</h3>
<p>綠林力勝仁餘一分</p>
<p>昨日籃球房內，人氣狂熱，觀衆不下三千餘人，極盛一時，各塲比賽均順利展開。</p>
<p>首場娘子軍綠隊挾精銳之師，抱必勝之次心，V隊昨曾予綠隊以力拒，綠隊屢在艱苦中得分，上半時十一比五，綠隊佔先。下半時綠隊漸見發展，完塲綠隊以三〇比一二勝。</p>
<p>繼爲甲二部綠林與仁餘交綏，各出全力，蓋勝負有關錦標前途，開賽後分數兎起鵲落，恒在一球之間相差，上半時一八比一七，綠林保持勝局。下半時綠林上場施威，瞬間以三〇比二三領先，仁餘呌停，分數越退越近，三七比三五空氣緊張，無以復加，最後於陳渭源罰入一球聲中，時間隨終，綠林終以三七比三六克服仁餘。從此田二部綠林·仁餘·紅隊·德勝均爲一敗之紀錄，或對時局面。</p>
<p>末塲甲一部油隊逢巨人，前者不幸以主將馬燦希離滬，全隊失却靈魂，但上半時能力圖振作，陳淸江與林維聰兩人之小傳遞，巨人亦覺無可如何，故上半時二一比一九，汕隊猶能以一球佔優。易邊後，巨人頻換生力軍，汕隊早有力不從心之現象，故一任巨人所作所爲，卡遜之妙射，又爲可怕，結果巨人三九分，汕隊二九分，汕隊慘遭巨人毒手。</p>

<h3>我還是要寫，寫……</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>我自已都弄不明自，居然學起寫文章來了；而且寫得最起勁的階段，是在關出學校大門，困守家園，無事可做的那一年。</p>
<p>那時，我的家，是在本市商業中心的繁華區域——南京路一帶，加以父親經商，住處的四週整天價人聲嘈雜：鬧鬧嚷嚷，無辦法「執筆」，在原稿紙上「成章」——眞是糟糕！</p>
<p>天曉得！自己的「文章」，根本是「一竅不通」，却學起老作家的作風：每天夜晚，總是寫，寫，寫，直到天亮，倒馬桶聲音，在里弄間動盪，迴響……我還是在暗澹的燈光底下厄坐着，在那里寫，寫……</p>
<p>接連幾個月，遲一起晏睡，度着白天當晚上，晚上當白天的日子，已經雙成面黃肌瘦，不成人樣了</p>
<p>一　　，你眞犯不着！我看你這樣天天寫到深更半夜，有啥好處呢？我從不曾看見你，在文章上出息過多少錢；我肴，你還是不要寫了，身體會弄壞呢！……唉！你這樣做，爲名呢，還是爲利呀？」有一天夜半，母親醒來，對我下這樣的「忠吿」。</p>
<p>這一下，我眞　住了，一句話也回答不出來；但，從此就有一個很大的「？」號，在我腦袋里盤旋，那就是：寫文章有什麼用呢？</p>
<p>如果說我學寫文章爲一名」吧，我的「文章」，常常被副刊的編者，丟在「字紙簍」里，無發表的機會，那里談得到「名」？說是爲「利」吧，那更可憐了，因爲即使有篇把「文章」，在報上刊載，所得稿費，到月底一算，也不過兩三塊錢。然而我爲寫文，化去的郵票，信封，稿紙，香烟，電費，茶水……等等的代價，絕不是這幾個稿費所能相抵。而我還是不肯聽母親的話，照常寫呀，寫的，自已也說不出一個所以然，究竟是爲了什麼？</p>
<p>不久，這「寫文章有什麼用」的問題，終於得到了解答，那是：好幾年以前，忍不住敵偽的壓迫，拔脚跑到內地，渴求呼吸自由空氣之際，正是「文章下鄕」，「文章入伍」的口號，呌得震天響的時候。</p>
<p>是的，我在鄕下，看到不少鼓勵人民，奮勇殺敵的「街頭詩」，以及表現前方將士，浴血抗戰的「通俗文藝」，也在部隊裏，看到不少敎育士兵的劇本的上演，與深入淺出的，抗戰英雄的英勇故事的流行。而老百姓與兵士們，在精神上，受着這些文章的感染，確爲民族，國家……捨身取義，殺身成仁的，也在在皆是。</p>
<p>文章的功能，雖似不能勝過大砲，機關槍，至少在敎育，鼓勵人民這一點意義上，已發了極大的火力！所以它之被稱爲投槍，匕首，就是這含意吧？</p>
<p>原來文章，並不是「揚名」的工具，也不是像商品一樣，到市塲上去出賣。它的最終的目的，是在在導引我們這一羣悲苦的人類，進人眞，善，美的，理想的境界。</p>
<p>我今天所以能　伙樂地活着，確也是受着那些「吃的是稻草」，「擠出來的是牛奶」的作家們的，充溢着受人類的熱情的作品的感染，懂得向善，愛別人的緣故。所以即使我的文章，常與編者先生的「字紙簍」爲伴，但我已經瞭解了文章的意義，我還是要寫，寫……。（却酬）</p>

<h3>南昌三個「三」</h3>
<p>— 江昭然</p>
<p>三荒：一是米荒，餓死者已「大有屍在」；二是屋荒，荒出了一句口號：「片瓦片金」；三是報館鬧紙荒，辦報的人說：「洛陽紙貴歟？南昌紙貴歟？」聽了眞呌人啼笑皆非。</p>
<p>多：一是扒手多，隨時隨地都得謹防飛來手；二是茶館多，原因是「饑思飲」者不可勝數；三是善男信女多，他們說：「再不拜佛不得了！</p>
<p>三奇：有些人不時請日俘大吃大喝，對於來討殘羹冷飯的乞丐，却說：「滾你媽的！」此一奇也；戲院時常鬧糾紛，大演眞悲劇，電影院年久失修，搖搖欲　，但觀衆還是擠得「側目而視」，「側耳而聽」。此二奇也；有人理一次髮，擲法幣一萬五千元，有人貼字條尋小孩，却寫道：「鄙人室如懸磐，如蒙尋獲小孩送回，唯有心領謝！」此三奇也。</p>
<p>三荒，三多，三奇，算來一共三個「三」。古有「三不朽」，我却願南昌的三個「三」，只是「曇花一現」，不要「不朽」！</p>
<p>敎育</p>
<h3>復興衛生敎育</h3>
<p>— 李仁衆</p>
<p>自抗戰後至勝利迄今止，普通高小學校原有的衛生課程，十九廢棄，好像是不十分注意似的。</p>
<p>我國向有東亞病夫之稱，八年來抗戰，軍民犧牲，戰士　運死亡，疫癘蔓延，國民的康健遠遜於戰前，欲挽此巨刦，　有待於醫藥衛生直接間接的救濟。但小學的衛生敎育，應竭力提倡，俾灌輸相當的衛生常識。使學童有防病的芻識！</p>
<p>最近我校在滬配購小學敎科書，遍詢各書局，均無衛生課本。希望當局竭力提倡，督促各市私立學校，應一律採用衛生敎科用書，以增國人康健，也是强國强種，强種先强身之道。希望這樣一來，有一天能洗刷東區病夫之恥。</p>

<p>看見了一條條蜿蜓的行列，，爭購平價糖，火油，……總不免有些心驚。戰爭已經早已遠去，但是，它的足跡，它的陰影，還始終控制着吾人，使過慣舒服日子的人們，都陷在物資匱乏物價飛漲的恐慌裏。</p>
<p>善後救濟總署的工作，讀報紙上的記載，也知道已進行了好久。顧名思義，當然該對貧苦的民衆，有很大的幫助了。</p>

<p>該救濟的人，有權利有資格享受平賣的人，都楊着腹，咬緊着牙關，在敎書，在當小公務員，在做商店的小職員。但是他們得出高的代價，去買高價的大餅，去向空閑的擠軋的人們的手中去買轉手的『平賣品』。</p>

<h3>The Supreme National Defense Council Passes the Open Foreign Exchange Market Proposal; Abolishes Current Official Foreign Exchange Rate; Allocates US$500 Million as Legal Tender Reserve</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] At the meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council on the morning of the 25th, Premier T.V. Soong proposed an open foreign exchange market plan on an ad hoc basis. This plan involves abolishing the current official foreign exchange rate and stipulates that the Central Bank should assess market conditions and, based on supply and demand, provide or purchase foreign exchange as needed for regulation and to prevent excessive fluctuations. The proposal was passed. The full text of the open foreign exchange market proposal, temporary measures for import and export trade, and temporary measures for the Central Bank for managing foreign exchange are recorded below:</p>
<p>Open Foreign Exchange Market Proposal</p>
<p>Investigation into the current situation shows that the absence of a public market for open foreign exchange is causing stagnation in foreign trade, leading to a wait-and-see attitude among industrial and commercial enterprises, which is a major obstacle to economic recovery. Furthermore, the lack of published implementing measures has led to speculation and increased activity on the black market, which is affecting gold prices, impacting finance, and stimulating commodity prices. Therefore, the foreign exchange market should be brought into order quickly to promote economic development and people's livelihood. Regarding the approach to restoring foreign trade and opening foreign exchange transactions, after detailed consideration, the following main measures are proposed: (1) Divide imported goods into three categories: (A) Industrial and livelihood necessities, which can be purchased and imported by the people without government permission. (B) Goods that can be imported after applying for a permit, such as tobacco, kerosene, automobiles, wool fabrics, and silk fabrics. (C) Certain luxury goods that are not allowed to be imported. (2) Establish a Provisional Committee for Import Planning to investigate and compile statistics on the import of various goods, review and adjust foreign purchases, and regulate matters related to the items in the preceding paragraph. (3) The Central Bank shall designate certain banks to buy and sell foreign exchange, but those requesting to purchase foreign exchange must prove that it is specifically for importing goods under categories (A) and (B) of the first paragraph. Those wishing to sell foreign exchange must also negotiate with the designated banks. (4) The current official foreign exchange rate should be abolished. The Central Bank should assess market conditions and, based on supply and demand, provide or purchase foreign exchange as needed for regulation and to prevent excessive fluctuations. The sale of foreign currency, banknotes, and gold will also be handled according to the same principles. (5) The government will allocate US$500 million as a legal tender reserve and instruct the Central Bank to allocate a considerable amount from its existing foreign exchange reserves as a fund for market stabilization at any time, and should strengthen the existing institutions and assign key personnel to be responsible for command and use.</p>
<p>Measures for Import and Export Trade</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Imported Goods</p>
<p>Article 1. Imported goods are divided into the following three categories: (1) Freely importable goods, (2) Goods requiring import permits, and (3) Prohibited goods. Article 2.

However, for goods ordered before the promulgation of these measures and permitted to arrive within 30 days, applications for exemptions may be made to the Customs Certification Office within 10 days after the promulgation of these measures.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Exported Goods</p>
<p>Article 5. All goods, except those listed in Schedule (C), may be freely exported, but exporters must submit to customs a certificate from a designated bank for the purchase of foreign exchange earned from exports before customs clearance is approved. This does not apply to goods with a value of less than US$25 and are not commercial in nature.</p>

(2) To compile a list of the quantity and value of goods already ordered or being procured and their arrival dates.

Article 10. The Customs may establish a Visa Office to handle the issuance of import permits and shall maintain close contact with the Central Bank. Article 11. These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Citizens Stage Demonstration and Parade; More Than 100,000 Participants from All Sectors</h3>

Students from major secondary schools in Wuchang, in addition to holding meetings and parades at Yuema Field in Wuchang, also sent representatives to Zhongshan Park to participate in the rally. The rally passed telegrams to President Chiang, various party figures, the U.S. and British governments, and Stalin, and after chanting slogans, the entire assembly marched through the city.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 25th] After students from various levels of schools in Chengdu held a large parade yesterday to protect national rights, they went on strike again today and departed to give speeches in different locations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] The British Broadcasting Corporation has just issued a news report stating that the Soviet government has delivered a note to the Chinese government protesting against the anti-Soviet demonstrations by Chinese students in recent days.</p>
<h3>Demonstration and Parade in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Approximately 2,000 fellow countrymen from the Northeast residing in Beijing held a parade at 10 AM on the 25th to protest the Northeast incident. They shouted slogans along the way, resonating in the sky. When passing Xinjiekou, they pasted dozens of red and green posters under a large oil painting of Stalin, with messages such as "The Northeast is the lifeblood of China" and "We must prevent another September 18th Incident." Some people pushed down the supporting pole of the oil painting, causing Marshal Stalin to sway precariously.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] A patriotic demonstration movement was held here this morning. An even larger demonstration parade will be held tomorrow, with an expected participation of over 20,000 people.</p>
<h3>Ambassador to the Soviet Union Returns to the Provisional Capital to Report on His Duties</h3>

<h3>Central Memorial Week; President Chiang's Address; Students' Parades Stem from Patriotic Enthusiasm; Hoping for Trust in the Government Regarding the Northeast Issue</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] The Central Memorial Week was held at 9 AM on the 25th in the National Government Auditorium. After President Chiang led the ceremonies, he delivered a speech that lasted 40 minutes, after which the ceremonies concluded.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] The main points of President Chiang's address to the participants at the National Government Memorial Week at 9 AM on the 25th were as follows: (1) During his two-week absence from Chongqing, he went to Nanjing and Shanghai for inspection and presided over a military reorganization conference in Nanjing. The generals present at the five-day conference unanimously and sincerely supported the Central Government's reorganization plan to reduce the army infantry from 250 divisions to 90 divisions, and concrete measures have been discussed and will be implemented. The generals understand the greater good and place national interests above all else, which is commendable. (2) One of the most important things he saw in Shanghai was the instability of finance and the economy, which led to high prices. After careful examination of the reasons, it was due to much speculation in the market about foreign exchange management and the failure to restore foreign import and export trade. A concrete solution has now been formulated and will be submitted to the National Defense Council for approval today, after which it can be implemented. (3) After arriving in Chongqing yesterday, he learned about the student parades in the provisional capital in the past two days, and understood that they were concerned about the issue of receiving the Northeast. While the actions of young students in the parades stem from patriotic enthusiasm, such important national affairs should be approached with reason, and there must be no radical emotions, and one must not go beyond the proper scope, otherwise it will damage the overall honor of our nation and increase the difficulties of the country. Therefore, he hopes that the people of the whole country will pay attention to the following three points: First, he hopes that the people of the whole country will trust the government, which will surely have a reasonable solution to the Northeast problem, and should not lightly listen to unfounded rumors from the outside world, and should not have激昂 excessive words and actions. The national government for twenty years, the process and all measures to protect national sovereignty, and seek administrative integrity should be recognized by the people of the whole country. As for the principles of cooperation discussed with the Soviet Union, the government has given to the Northeast Headquarters (1) must abide by our country's laws, (2) respect the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, (3) do not conflict with our country's general international agreements. This is the government's policy on the Northeast issue, and it is specifically stated to the people of the whole country, hoping that you will have no doubts. Second, everyone must know that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union is necessary not only for China but also for the Soviet Union. It is also necessary for world peace after the war, so the friendship between China and the Soviet Union must be maintained and continued to be enhanced, and all of us in China must not be shaken in this belief or neglect its efforts because of temporary or single events. Third, the various laws restricting the freedom of the people during the war have now been abolished, and the speech and actions of the general public must be self-loving and self-respecting, and must be examined at all times, and must not exceed the proper scope of the law. I deeply hope that the people of the whole country will use their freedom with the spirit of responsible and disciplined, which is a necessary prerequisite for us to implement the people's livelihood.</p>

<h3>Military Reorganization Plan Signed Yesterday; Implementation to Begin Today; Three-Person Group to Inspect Various Locations in the Coming Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th] The Military Three-Person Group Conference, after six rounds of consultations, officially concluded yesterday. At 4 PM on the 25th, a reception was held at the office of the Chief of Staff of the National Government (Yaolu) to welcome domestic and foreign reporters in Chongqing. The hall was simply decorated, with a desk and chair in the center, and a purple curtain hanging quietly on the screen behind it. The lighting was soft, with mercury lamps on both sides. The floor was covered with a patterned light red and yellow carpet. At each end of the room was another table with cigarettes on it. Seats were arranged along the walls for the reporters. By the time the meeting started, more than 50 reporters had arrived, and the small room suddenly became crowded. At 3:50 PM, Marshal Marshall arrived and took a short rest in the lounge. At 4 PM sharp, the meeting began. Zhang Zhizhong, Marshall, and Zhou Enlai successively came to the stage and briefly greeted the reporters. Zhang Zhizhong first signed three originals of the military reorganization and integration plan bound in blue silk. At this moment, the mercury lamps shone brightly in the center of the room, and the cameras were clicking. The reporters left their seats one after another and gathered around the desk. Zhou Enlai and Marshall signed in succession. Zhang Zhizhong then delivered a speech on behalf of the government, guaranteeing that the government would realize the plan 100%, and thanked Marshal Marshall in person. Zhou Enlai also represented the Communist Party of China, guaranteeing to all parties that the plan would be fully implemented, and hoped that reporters would work hard to urge the people of the whole country to supervise the implementation of this plan, and expressed his gratitude to Marshal Marshall. He also said that the situation of armed conflict must be changed and replaced by peaceful nation-building. Finally, Marshal Marshall delivered a simple speech, thanking Zhang Zhizhong and Zhou Enlai for their praise, and said: "This agreement is a great hope for China, and I believe that this agreement will not fail to be fully implemented due to the obstruction of a small number of stubborn elements." After Marshal Marshall finished his speech, refreshments were served. Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall drank champagne together, while the reporters were busy asking the three to sign their names and toasting each other, wishing for the imminent realization of peace. At 4:55 PM, Marshal Marshall left, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Speeches by Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall</h3>

Government representative Zhang Zhizhong, Communist representative Zhou Enlai, and advisor Marshall signed the agreement at 4:00 PM on the 25th in the office of the Chief of Staff of the National Government. This historically significant ceremony was held in a solemn and harmonious atmosphere. At 4:15 PM, Marshall, Zhang, and Zhou entered the meeting room together. Minister Zhang, amidst the bright lights and the eager attention of representatives from various parties, was the first to take his seat and sign. Zhou Enlai followed, and Marshall signed last.

As the three men signed, photographers scrambled to capture the moment. Zhang Zhizhong, Zhou Enlai, and Marshall then delivered speeches, which were translated into Chinese and English by Advisor Pi Zongjing, Zhang Wenjin, and U.S. Army Captain Wu Hanmin, respectively. After the speeches, the three men shook hands, and the audience responded with enthusiastic applause. A reception was then held, where everyone raised their glasses in celebration with joyful hearts, as all parties had a definite hope and confidence in the end of the past eighteen years of internal strife and the beautiful vision of a peaceful nation-building future. This historically significant scene concluded around 5:00 PM. The original text of the three speeches is recorded below:</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhong's Speech</p>
<p>Government Representative Zhang Zhizhong said: "Today, the Military Mediation Group, composed of the government representative, the Communist representative, and Advisor Marshall, signed the basic plan for military reorganization and incorporating the Communist forces into the National Army. This is of great significance, as everyone knows. The government and the Communist Party have been in opposition for eighteen years. During this period, countless talents have been sacrificed, much of the nation's vitality has been consumed, and much construction has been delayed due to the Communist problem and the civil war problem. Today's signing of this plan can be said to have ended the eighteen years of disputes and opposition. We must abandon the use of weapons as tools of war and enter a new era of peace. The peaceful, unified, democratic, and united nation that our people have been hoping for will be realized, and it has been guaranteed in this document. The success of the Political Consultative Conference lies in achieving the goal of political democratization, and this document will lay the foundation for the nationalization of the military. In the future, our country should follow the grand policy of peaceful construction to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. I represent the government in signing this plan and guarantee its implementation one hundred percent, so as to achieve the goal of gradual military nationalization. The fact that this meeting has such a good result should be attributed to our great friend, General Marshall. I extend my sincere gratitude and profound respect."</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai's Speech</p>
<p>Communist Representative Zhou Enlai said, "Minister Zhang, General Marshall, and friends, today is a day of great success, because today we signed the basic plan for military reorganization and incorporation. On January 10th, at General Marshall's residence, we signed the agreement to cease military conflict. On January 31st, the Political Consultative Conference of the National Government passed five resolutions. This time, at 'Yaolu', we signed this plan again. These illustrate that we are taking steps towards the goals of political democratization, military nationalization, and equal and legal status for all parties. I, representing the Chinese Communist Party, assure you that we will ensure that the basic plan for military reorganization that we have signed this time is implemented one hundred percent. This basic plan that we have signed stipulates the various terms for reorganizing the army and incorporating the Communist army into the National Army. This covers the entire country, so as Minister Zhang said, it is a guarantee of peace for China. We believe that the implementation of this plan will change the situation of armed conflict that has lasted for eighteen years. It will enable China to achieve peace, democracy, unity, and unification, and it will enable China to enter a modern, industrialized nation. I also think that this success should be attributed to the assistance and efforts of China's friends and General Marshall. I also thank Minister Zhang, with whom I have cooperated many times over the past twenty years. Minister Zhang's efforts on this plan have made a great contribution."</p>
<p>Marshall's Speech</p>
<p>Special Envoy Marshall said, in translation: "This agreement represents the hope of China. I can only hope that its pages will not be stained by a few uncompromising elements who, for selfish purposes, may thwart the Chinese people who eagerly seek the right to live in peace and prosperity."</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Grain Prices Soar, All Rice Shops Destroyed</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 25th] Hangzhou rice prices rose from 25,000 at 9:00 AM on the 24th to 38,000 at 10:00 AM. Rice shops hoarded rice and refused to sell it, with black market prices reaching 51,000 per shi, which aroused public anger. The destruction of rice shops started in the lower city and gradually spread to more than 130 shops throughout the city, none of which were spared. Utensils and rice were scattered all over the streets, and the losses were enormous and impossible to calculate. Police officers in Chou'anfang fired shots into the air, injuring two civilians and a former official. Upon hearing the news, the authorities quickly devised countermeasures, first dispatching military police to persuade the public not to act rashly. In the afternoon, provincial and municipal authorities held an emergency meeting and decided on the following prices: 17,000 for white japonica, 21,000 for white superior, 22,000 for Hunan superior, 23,000 for Luo superior, and 90% of the price for brown rice, with a limit of one dou per person. Other measures were difficult to implement. On the 25th, more than 200 rice shops in the city must open for business. Mayor Zhou stated that those who resist orders will be severely punished. The price of subsidized rice was set at 15,000, with the municipal government handling 100 shi per day.</p>
<h3>Complex Situation of Conflict in the Northeast, Zhou Enlai Ordered to Present New Proposal</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 25th, urgent telegram] Chongqing News: Fierce fighting has broken out in the Northeast. The Communist army was once defeated near 　yang, but has now received reinforcements and is continuing to attack Xinmin. According to reliable reports, Zhang Xueshi did not participate in this conflict. It is said that Zhang has sent someone to Peiping to negotiate surrender.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] It is widely rumored here today that a division of the Soviet Red Army from Poland has arrived in the Northeast, but this news has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Peiping, 23rd] After the New Sixth Army arrived in the Northeast, Du Yuming's isolated army received powerful assistance and gradually expanded its defense area. North of Xinmin, it entered Fakucheng County on the 18th. In the Liaohe Plain, it crossed Taian and entered Liaozhong. The Communist army in the above areas has suffered considerable setbacks. The CCP in Yan'an has been eager to resolve military conflicts and various disputes in the Northeast peacefully. Xinhua News Agency here revealed that after Zhou Enlai returned to Yan'an on the 19th, the CCP gave Zhou a new instruction, ordering him to submit a proposal to the government to stop the conflict in the Northeast. After Zhou asked Yu, he submitted it to the government. The recent situation in the Northeast is complex and serious, and it is feared that no results have been negotiated. In Rehe, the commander of the 13th Army, Yu, held a meeting with Xiao Ke, commander of the Communist Jireliao Military Region, in Pingquan, but the gap between the two sides' opinions was too great and no results were achieved. It is also reported that Du Yuming came to Peiping for medical treatment on the 18th, and Zheng Dongguo will fly to Jinzhou to temporarily take command of the New Sixth Army, the 13th Army, and the 52nd Army.</p>

<h3>Problem of Emperor Hirohito's Abdication, Opinions Divided into Two Factions</h3>
<p>Imperial Household Ministry to be Reorganized and Downsized</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] A certain important person in the Imperial Household today told a United Press reporter that factions for and against Emperor Hirohito's abdication are forming behind the scenes among the imperial family and senior courtiers. Hirohito himself has expressed his intention to abdicate at an appropriate time, motivated by accepting responsibility for the war, not to avoid being arrested as a war criminal while in office. The faction in favor of abdication believes that Hirohito should bear moral and spiritual responsibility for the war, but because many files have been destroyed and memoirs of those who participated in the secret developments before the war are confusing, it is difficult for people of high position to determine Hirohito's direct relationship to the origins of the war. The opposition faction argues that those responsible for the war were cabinet members and not the emperor, so Hirohito should remain in office. If Hirohito's abdication becomes a reality, it will be followed by the succession of Prince Hirohito, who is only twelve years old, assisted by a regent to govern the country.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th Special Telegram] The Japanese Imperial Household Ministry will be reorganized into the Imperial Household Agency, the Minister of the Imperial Household Ministry will be changed to the Director, and the original staff of 2,000 will be reduced to 400.

He said that the situation in April, May, June, and July will be the worst. If sufficient food is not imported from abroad, food riots will inevitably occur, and starving people may attack Allied warehouses. At the same time, it is very possible that rioters will attack Japanese farmers. He said that the food shortage in Japan is so severe that some Japanese people are eating rats and silkworm pupae. Most Japanese people are waiting for winter and spring to come so that they can eat some kind of green grass.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Remaining in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Currently Number 1.6 Million, Excluding the Kwantung Army</p>

Today, the British Empire is being hit by a storm again. Its potential is as serious as any in the past.

Other countries are concerned about the empire's dual pressures, especially the United States. At the same time, the United States has great sympathy for the desire of all people for independence. The United States will likely sympathize with activists operating in the name of independence in areas under imperial administration, it is said.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 24th] It was announced today that the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference will be held in London at the end of March. The conference will discuss two issues: imperial defense and federal relations.

Second, the future trend of preferential trade systems within the empire and with foreign countries, and the attitudes of the three federations towards peace treaties.</p>

<p>Our County Sets a Deadline to Eradicate Narcotics</p>
<p>Eradicating narcotics is one of the most important central tasks of our county this year. It is reported that the County Police Bureau recently received instructions from the County Government, along with a plan to eradicate narcotics and a self-rehabilitation pledge form for narcotics users. The bureau has been ordered to handle this in two phases: general inspection and general denunciation.

<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Lack of Coal Prevents Resumption of Work</p>
<p>Many factories in the area were damaged during the occupation period. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, those with minor damage have resumed work, while those with more serious damage are still under repair and cannot be restored for the time being. The biggest reason for this is the shortage of electricity. Silk and yarn mills and flour mills are only operating every other day. Other factories, such as paper mills and foundries, have not yet resumed work due to the lack of electricity. Although requests have been made to the power plant to restore electricity, the coal shortage cannot be resolved. In the blink of an eye, new silkworm cocoons will be on the market, and silk mills will resume work. Rice seedlings also need irrigation, which requires even more electricity. Therefore, if the coal shortage cannot be resolved, agricultural and industrial production cannot be increased, and the future is worrying.</p>

The third bomb will explode several thousand feet underwater, and the pressure will cause the ship's hull to collapse. This special bomb is still in the planning stage and cannot be used immediately at the beginning, fearing that it will completely destroy the ships used as test targets. This deep-water test is expected to cause violent boiling on the surface and will be carried out in deep water far from inhabited coastlines, merchant shipping routes, and fishing areas.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bikini Atoll, 24th] The atomic bomb experiment will be held in the waters near this island in May. At that time, only an automated recording robot will be on the island as an observer. Naval construction units will soon begin building concrete towers on this island, with walls lined with lead, to house cameras and scientific instruments. The island's natives will have to abandon their homes and move to the nearby Rongerik Island within a few days, but they apparently do not resent this. The island has only coconut trees, a few breadfruit trees, and taro plants. There are several small huts made of pandanus, including a "government house" and a church. It is truly remarkable that the islanders can maintain their strong bodies in such a simple living environment. The natives are all friendly and polite, and all but the children are fully clothed, thanks to the teachings of the missionaries. The natives have quickly learned the value of American currency, and all prices are calculated in US dollars. Once the islanders have been relocated, the engineering team will begin various preparations for the atomic bomb experiment on this island, which is two and a half miles long and one and a half miles wide.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 24th] The US Navy Department announced today that three fully loaded "New Guinea pigs" ships to be tested with atomic bombs in the Marshall Islands in May have left here for the "Bikini Atoll" test site.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 24th] The Daily Express reported today that regarding the situation of atomic research, the United States Army has stopped informing British scientists of the research results for four months, as the British side has made no recent contributions in exchange. The atomic research institute that Britain already has has almost come to a standstill. The construction of the institute in Didcot Valley, Berkshire, has also been stopped due to a lack of personnel. Britain had originally allocated six million US dollars for experimental expenses, but now it is unable to proceed because it has not been able to obtain both protactinium and uranium 235 from the United States.</p>

<h3>A Jiangnan City Full of Northern Flavor: A Cross-Section of Life in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Jiang Jun</p>
<p>Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 21st (airmail dispatch)</p>
<p>This is a modern northern city.</p>
<p>Several roads running through the city are lined with huge billboards. The wide roads in the middle are dotted with long, round flower beds. Every traveler who arrives in Xuzhou for the first time will nod in greeting: Xuzhou is a modern city. Yes, Xuzhou is moving towards the road of a modern city. There are fashionable girls with hairspray fragrance, streamlined cars, cinemas, dance halls, and the latest urban equipment. However, the surface cannot represent the substance. The true face of Xuzhou, like most Chinese towns, is still lingering in the era decades ago.</p>
<p>Ah Q in Xuzhou</p>
<p>Learning Fashion</p>
<p>Despite the wooden sign saying "No Ox-carts in the Street", the old ox-carts, as if indifferent, still swagger through the market. The creaking sound of wheelbarrows continues day and night, endlessly. A truly local girl is a simple "Edao Mao" (referring to a simple quilted cotton padded jacket and trousers worn by women in the countryside), a cheongsam that is the same thickness from top to bottom, revealing a large section of bulky cotton padded trousers, with no curves to speak of.</p>
<p>Cinemas are a place for a minority to spend their leisure time. The entertainment methods of ordinary people are either to listen to Qingchang (a type of folk singing) in a shuyu (brothel) or to appreciate Henan Bangzi opera. The water heater equipment in the official residence of the Pacification Commissioner is only one in the entire city, and there are no branches. Ninety-five percent of the people still live in the oriental-style buildings inherited from our ancestors. As for dance halls, it is a big joke to Shanghai people: Do not imagine the waxed floor. The dance floor here is just an ordinary cement floor. After a few rounds of dancing, gray sand swirls with the dance, and the crude and vulgar military music has become all the accompaniment. Among the three dance partners, the girls from the circus are often the other two. Not a few are from brothels. The semi-urban and semi-rural female students, not wanting to be outdone, sit in groups of three or five to "learn". The audience exceeds the seated guests, crowding inside and outside the door, staring with both eyes, competing to see this "foreign trick". The colorful dancers: flying generals, "Chiuba" soldiers, country bumpkins – magnificent, breathtaking. This is just like "Ah Q" learning fashion, not thoroughly.</p>
<p>Thirty Miles East of the City</p>
<p>Strictly Guarded</p>
<p>The news of victory has been six months ago, but so far, Xuzhou is still the Xuzhou of the past. Nothing has been restored, and it still carries the remaining mood of wartime. The area thirty miles east of Xuzhou is the "liberated area" controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. Bunkers and fortifications are heavily guarded. In order to defend local security, the Xuzhou city area is under curfew after 11 pm. Late at night, all is silent. In the silence, one can feel loneliness, and in the loneliness, it seems as if one can breathe in the terrifying smell of gunpowder.</p>
<p>During the day, soldiers of different units walk back and forth in the streets and alleys. In the square, in the early morning, soldiers are diligently engaged in combat training. In the foreign-style house of the Tongshan Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, Communist Party soldiers with badges of the "New Fourth Army" and "Eighth Route Army" live harmoniously with the comrades of the Central Military Police. All of this constantly sweeps dark clouds across people's hearts that cannot be removed at present.</p>
<p>Customs and Sentiments</p>
<p>Northern Flavor</p>
<p>The customs and sentiments of Xuzhou are all with a northern flavor: dry, windy, and dusty. Therefore, the automobile class in Xuzhou is particularly majestic. Where the wheels pass, dust rises, and pedestrians are as if falling into a heavy fog.</p>
<p>The character of the people of Xuzhou is simple and straightforward. The reporter has been asked several times such questions: "To what extent have the government and the Communist Party negotiated? Fight or make peace, why is it always so vague?" The question, although it inevitably contains a little naivety, clearly shows that they are concerned about state affairs and are hoping for the arrival of true peaceful days!</p>
<p>Due to the general public's concern about the development of the political situation, the sales of newspapers in Xuzhou are not bad, especially the Shanghai Shen Bao and Ta Kung Pao, which are very popular with readers.</p>
<p>Common Sense of Depression</p>
<p>No News</p>
<p>There are two local publications, Zhong Bao and Xu Bao. The content and printing quality are both inferior. The Xu Bao was founded in 1929 and has a longer history. The president is an elderly old man of seventy-three years old, in very good spirits, who claims to be an amateur in running a newspaper. There are more than a dozen local and foreign reporters active in Xuzhou. They all have a common sense of depression: Xuzhou is a place with no news. Although freedom of reporting on military mediation is clearly stipulated in the Political Consultative Conference, the relevant authorities in Xuzhou believe that their duties are important and keep their mouths shut. The reporters simply cannot "get started".</p>
<p>Prices are rising step by step, and military conflicts and mediation are becoming more and more mysterious. Nowadays, the general price index in Xuzhou is even higher than that of Jinghu (Nanjing and Shanghai). People live in an "unbearable" circle.</p>
<p>Ladies Sleeping on the Floor</p>
<p>When the reporter first arrived, Xuzhou was experiencing a widespread housing shortage. According to the person in charge of adjusting houses, the current population of Xuzhou is close to 300,000, which is almost twice as high as before the war, which is one of the reasons for the housing shortage. However, the main problem is not the number of houses, but the uneven distribution. The confiscated properties of enemies and pseudo-officials are still shelved and have not been dealt with. Most of the giant buildings and mansions have an armed comrade standing guard outside the door, but no one is inside. This kind of contradictory phenomenon is currently being rectified by the authorities. At present, most of the top hotels in Xuzhou are requisitioned in whole or in part by military organs. Military and government officials and their families often reside there, so if travelers are not through the "official" route, they can not expect to be served. In Xuzhou, it is not uncommon for well-dressed ladies to temporarily sleep on the floor in hotels.</p>
<p>Xuzhou wine is drunk and does not hurt the brain. However, according to those familiar with the local situation, women are more charming than wine. Xuzhou has a famous "soul-melting den" called "Jin Guli." Jin Guli is like Guangxi's Tezhali (a red light district), with neat and elegant buildings and a smaller scale but a unique charm. There are more than twenty houses here, each with dozens of courtesans, whose lives are not bad. In summary, the normal state of Xuzhou is waiting to be established quickly.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Kunming</h3>
<p>Another misfortune that emerged after the Kunming recession is unemployment, which has become an important issue in the lives of Kunming residents for the first time in many years. In fact, during the War of Resistance, there was a great shortage of labor, especially in skilled technical workers. After the Japanese surrendered, this situation has reversed 180 degrees, and a large number of workers have no work to do. At the end of November last year, a spokesman for the provincial government said that the number of unemployed people at that time was about 50,000. However, according to well-informed and qualified sources, it is feared that the number is even higher than this. During the household registration survey in the first month of this year, Kunming City had a total of 300,000 residents. If this number is correct, then at least one in six people is unemployed.</p>
<p>People often talk about the government lending money to factories to help them through this transition period. Although local industrialists have submitted urgent petitions to the government, they have not yet received practical relief to date. Not only that, it should also be said that the government has decided to create "trust"-style state-owned industries (such as organizations like the China Textile Company). This news has caused considerable unrest and panic among local industrialists. (Translated from the February issue of Millard's Review.)</p>
<h3>Observations on Salt Administration Reform (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xu Erxin</p>
<p>The salt fields produce salt, which is managed, allocated, and sold by state-owned salt companies. In reality, the merchants are responsible for selling the salt to the consumers. To sell salt, the merchants must first apply to the responsible salt affairs administration office for a license. Once approved, they must provide a substantial guarantee and pay a deposit before starting business. During operation, merchants must keep detailed records of all transactions in ledgers for inspection. They must also have complete storage facilities for salt to allow officials to inspect their warehouses at any time, thereby preventing the sale of smuggled salt. The quantity of salt purchased, sold, and stored must be recorded daily on forms. Merchants must sell salt at the regulated price and are not allowed to increase prices arbitrarily, short-weight customers, or mix the salt with mud or sand. They must also display salt samples prominently in their shops. Street vendors who carry salt to sell in villages must also be registered and licensed, and they must provide a substantial guarantee before starting business. All wholesale and retail salt transactions must be recorded separately for inspection. The routes and locations for sales must be clearly defined, and vendors are not allowed to sell outside of designated areas to prevent abuse. Any merchant may freely apply for a sales license without restriction, and people are free to buy from them.</p>
<p>Rectification of Anti-Smuggling</p>
<p>Salt taxes in our country are relatively high, leading to the prevalence of smuggled salt and slow sales of government salt, making anti-smuggling necessary to protect tax revenue. Throughout history, laws have been strict and regulations numerous. Even with patrol officers and soldiers spread everywhere, the more stringent the anti-smuggling efforts, the more prevalent smuggled salt becomes, because the high profits incentivize people to take risks. Not only are anti-smuggling units often ineffective and unable to fulfill their responsibilities, some may even collude in smuggling, and others may even smuggle salt themselves. As a result, they fail to effectively manage anti-smuggling and tax protection, achieving little success. In recent years, the financial authorities have focused on rectification, significantly reducing smuggled salt and yielding substantial benefits. In the future, anti-smuggling affairs should have unified authority and be handled uniformly, establishing sound institutions and exerting effective force. Emphasis should be placed on inspecting salt fields, as no smuggled salt can arise if no salt leaves the fields illegally. Within each salt field area, a sufficient number of troops should be stationed based on the area's size to conduct patrols. Furthermore, teams should be stationed at key transportation routes to conduct inspections and implement encirclement and interception measures. Near seaports, where smuggled salt is most likely to emerge, patrol boats or shallow-water gunboats must be deployed for frequent patrols to prevent leakage. At key land and water crossings between production and sales areas, patrol checkpoints must be established to conduct inspections and interceptions. In addition, troops should be deployed along specified transportation routes to set up anti-smuggling lines to prevent smuggled salt from entering sales areas and to prevent government officials from smuggling goods. It seems more effective to entrust the inspection affairs in sales areas to local governments, specifically assigning the responsibility of inspecting smuggled goods to local police units. All confiscated goods from successful seizures should be sold, and after deducting the tax revenue, the remainder should be used to reward the personnel involved and those who contributed. In addition, bonuses should be given to show encouragement. Furthermore, salt producers in the production areas should be organized into mutual guarantee groups to monitor each other and implement joint liability. If anyone secretly opens new salt fields, illegally increases sun-drying boards, secretly transports salt, hides excess salt, smuggles salt, or colludes with smugglers, neighboring households should truthfully report them. If violations are not reported and are discovered, joint liability should be enforced. This type of production area inspection, with its focus on prevention, is truly a fundamental solution to anti-smuggling.</p>
<p>This state monopoly system, in which the state-owned salt company is responsible for the monopoly business, is different from a free market system, but it is not a complete monopoly. Instead, it is a system of planned control with limited freedom. Salt producers are free to produce salt, and merchants are free to sell it in sales areas. At the same time, salt fields with high production costs and scattered locations that are difficult to manage are abolished and closed. Those who secretly produce salt are severely punished. Merchants must register and obtain licenses and operate within designated areas and routes, subject to the management of the relevant salt affairs administration. On one hand, planned control is implemented over salt production, procurement, transportation, storage, and sales, balancing planned economy and free economy, and taking into account both state-owned and private enterprises. That is, planned economy is used to develop state-owned enterprises, with the goal of achieving nationalization of capital and benefits for the masses. It is deeply believed that this does not violate the principles of economic construction that our country should adopt after the war. However, the salt law stipulates a system of tax collection at the salt fields and free trade for the people, which is not fully consistent. But until the salt production is strictly managed and the salt tax rate is reduced, there will be many abuses in a free trade system after the tax collection. In this state monopoly system, the salt company pays the tax at the specified rate when it goes to the salt fields for allocation and transportation, which is equivalent to collecting taxes at the salt fields. The salt company is responsible for allocation and sales, while merchants are responsible for free sales in various regions. Consumers are also free to purchase salt without time limits. This is a system of limited free trade. Once the salt production is rectified, management is strict and complete, the objective conditions for free trade are met, and smuggled salt can be prevented, it will not be too late to implement the system of tax collection at the salt fields and free trade according to the salt law.</p>
<h3>News Outside the News</h3>
<p>New Flying Boat Ascent Technique</p>
<p>Professor Biggard, an instructor of marine and atmospheric studies at the University of Minnesota, is planning another exploratory flight. Biggard, now sixty-one years old, rose to fame in the early 1940s for his balloon ascents. Biggard now intends to ascend in a flying boat suspended by one hundred balloons. He hopes to reach an altitude of twenty miles (105,600 feet) to discover the secrets of cosmic rays. It is believed that this ascent will usher in a new era of atomic research. The balloons used for the ascent will be made of a gelatinous material, each capable of expanding to 100,000 cubic feet in the upper atmosphere. Mrs. Biggard plans to serve as the balloon's pilot.</p>
<p>Atomic Fission Machine</p>
<p>Instruments for studying atoms are constantly emerging. Recently, American scientists invented a new type of atomic fission machine. This machine can split uranium-235 for use in manufacturing atomic bombs. Ionized uranium-235 can be introduced into a vacuum tube. The uranium-235 is separated in the tube by an electric arc, combining each atom with an electric current. Magnets can rotate the atoms in the tube, with the speed of rotation varying according to the atomic weight and current. Another "restorer" is used to collect atoms with different rotation speeds for use.</p>
<p>New Type of Helicopter</p>
<p>The Siorsky Aircraft Division of the United Aircraft Association has built a new type of helicopter. The emergence of this aircraft has truly set a new international record. Aircraft experts at Bridgeport, Connecticut, are stepping up research to enable helicopters to be used for commercial shipping and short-distance flights.</p>
<p>The new type of helicopter has a rotor at the tail and top, and three landing wheels. The fuselage is made of plastic. Its speed is 114.6 miles per hour. (The previous world record was 76.15 miles per hour). With a load of 1,000 pounds, the speed is 110 miles per hour, and with 1,650 pounds, it is 105 miles per hour. The highest ascent record is 21,000 feet, about 10,000 feet higher than the previous world record.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Northeast Problem is an International Problem</h3>
<p>In recent days, the Northeast problem has gradually become the most watched issue by people around the world. The Northeast problem, in its essence and in its form, has already become an international problem.</p>
<p>After the students in the capital marched and petitioned over the Northeast problem, similar actions have sprung up in various places. Yesterday, students across Shanghai boycotted classes to promote the cause, and today they are rumored to have an even larger march to express their patriotic fervor and protection of rights. This is not only happening among students, nor is it limited to Shanghai alone. The Northeast is China's lifeline. The integrity of the Northeast is the integrity of China. Recovering the Northeast has been the unanimous desire of the Chinese people for the past fifteen years since the September 18th Incident. Now, more than half a year has passed since the victory of the War of Resistance, and the obstacles to receiving the Northeast are so great that anyone cannot help but feel the gravity of foreign insults and the disturbances of internal treachery. When people are in dire straits, they return to their roots. When people are sick and in pain, they cry out for their parents, which is a natural thing. Therefore, it is a common occurrence in any country for patriotic citizens to demonstrate and demand that the government engage in solemn negotiations and not continue to appease and concede. Unexpectedly, the Soviet radio broadcast actually referred to this as an anti-Soviet activity by "reactionary elements." The government has already lodged a protest with China. We really do not know what the Soviet allied people would think if they were in our shoes.</p>
<p>Lest we exaggerate, China is always the most peace-loving country. The fact that China has been subjected to aggression for years is a fact. Today, the fact that China wants to strive for liberation from aggression and oppression is also a fact. The Chinese people will never forget the various forms of assistance provided by the Soviet Union in the early stages of the War of Resistance. This is also a fact. Just look at how China, even as a victorious nation and one of the four great powers, is willing to sign the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Friendship, hoping to maintain peace in the Far East for at least thirty years. It is willing to recognize the independence of Outer Mongolia, recognize the joint operation of the Northeast Railway, and recognize the lease of Lushun and Dalian, as if China were a defeated country. China does not care about it either. China's sincerity in being friendly to the Soviet Union should be seen by everyone in the world. Even if we do not talk about the secret agreement of Yalta, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Friendship, as it was agreed upon by both parties, should be jointly observed by both parties. The Sino-Soviet Treaty is the most important covenant in China's international affairs this year, because it contributes the most to world peace. If this treaty can be broken and not observed, then what righteousness can be talked about in the international community, and what treaties can be mentioned? And would not the organization of the United Nations and the establishment of the Security Council be unnecessary? Therefore, to put it bluntly, China's Northeast problem is not only a Chinese problem today, nor is it just a Sino-Soviet problem, but an international problem involving the entire world. International problems can only be resolved internationally. Therefore, when we discuss the Northeast problem, we must first see this point clearly and firmly oppose attempting to resolve the Northeast problem by abusing domestic political negotiation methods among political parties. Otherwise, it will inevitably lead to a situation of increasing chaos and leave endless troubles for the country.</p>
<p>The occurrence, evolution, and development of the Northeast problem to its current stage are not just issues related to China and the Soviet Union. It has always been an international problem. From the standpoint of the Chinese people, we certainly do not want to see such an international problem in our own territory, but this problem first appeared as an international problem. Originally, China's full-scale war of resistance against Japan after the Lugouqiao Incident was aimed at ensuring the integrity of our territory and sovereignty. If Japan is defeated and China recovers the Northeast, there will be no Northeast problem, and there will be no problem with the international implications that currently exist in the Northeast. The reason why the situation in the Northeast has developed to its current point is not due to our autonomy, but to the revival of so-called "power politics" in international relations. Overthrowing "power politics" was originally the goal of the war against the Axis powers. Unexpectedly, during the war against the Axis powers, "power politics" secretly raised its head again—this is manifested in the secret agreement of Yalta, as it is manifested in the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
<p>It is because of the Yalta Agreement that the situation in the Northeast has developed as it is today. China is not a participant in the Yalta Agreement, and in theory, is not bound by the Yalta Agreement. However, the agreement established in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, which is the cornerstone of the new Sino-Soviet relationship, is tacitly built upon the thread of Yalta. In the Yalta Agreement, President Roosevelt took on the obligation of making China accept the Yalta Agreement. It was under the urging of our ally, the United States, that China concluded the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship with our other ally, the Soviet Union, making the greatest concessions with the mood of a brave man breaking his arm in order to maintain world peace. We trusted our allies, expecting that after making the greatest concessions, we would be able to achieve our desire to rebuild the Northeast. The countries that participated in the Yalta Agreement should bear full responsibility for the development of the situation in the Northeast to its current stage! The reason why the Yalta Conference had this secret agreement was obviously because the Soviet Union used its participation in the war as a demand to force the United Kingdom and the United States to do so. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Soviet Union is the original instigator of the current situation in the Northeast, and that the disaster originated in Yalta. The United States and the United Kingdom, which participated in the Yalta Conference, should not shirk their responsibility in clarifying the current situation in the Northeast in terms of morality!</p>
<p>The current situation in Cambodia is not only that China has failed to carry out the reception work. The main conclusions, in summary, are as follows: (1) The issue of so-called "spoils of war." If the term "spoils of war" is interpreted broadly, it will include everything; (2) The question of so-called "corridors" and "new Xinjiang soil" is clearly contrary to the meaning of China's territorial and sovereign integrity; (3) Creating and developing a situation within the Soviet-occupied area that conflicts with the interests of the Chinese National Government, hoping to turn it into a "fait accompli," from a problem that is itself an international problem into a problem that looks like a domestic problem on the surface. As for what is called "economic cooperation," it especially reminds us of the demands made by Hirota back then. This has a different feeling in the hearts of the Chinese people. What is particularly worrying about the developing situation in the Northeast is the centrifugal and divisive movement. Needless to say about the "East Mongolian People's Republic," there is also the so-called "People's Armed Forces" developing in the Northeast, echoing the Chinese Communist Party's army and hindering the advance of our national army. All of this is contrary to the original intention of the allied countries that fought against the Axis powers, and especially contrary to the purpose of China's bitter eight-year war and firm rejection of the Japanese invaders. If the United Nations does not want to repeat the mistakes of the old League of Nations, in order to ensure the security of the world, it should resolutely assume the responsibility for a fair solution to the Northeast problem today. US Secretary of State Byrnes's previous statement that the Northeast reception issue will be referred to the Far Eastern Advisory Commission for a solution may have the same view as ours, and the United States' awareness of its mistakes at the Yalta Conference can also be known to some extent.</p>
<p>This newspaper's previous discussion of the Northeast situation stated: "The 'Agreement on the Northeast Region' was signed by the Chinese National Government and the Soviet Government. Before the power of the National Government reaches the Northeast, the Soviet Union has a treaty obligation to transfer the entire Northeast to the National Government. Therefore, the Soviet Union should not allow any situation that conflicts with the interests of the National Government to arise and develop within the defense zone." Why would there be so-called "People's Armed Forces" in the Northeast? Why did the Soviet authorities not stop it? Why does the propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party emphasize this point in particular, hoping to turn it into a domestic problem? Undoubtedly, the Chinese Communist Party has become a puppet of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union is cultivating its puppet forces in the Northeast. This newspaper also stated in the same editorial: "When former US Vice President Wallace came to China a few years ago, he said that the length of the border between China and the Soviet Union is comparable only to the border between the United States and Canada, and he hoped that the border between China and the Soviet Union could be as good as the border between the United States and Canada in promoting understanding and cooperation between the two countries. We also sincerely hope that this long border can be as good as the border between the United States and Canada." This newspaper has always valued the friendship with our ally, the Soviet Union. This can be seen from this, but because we value it, we must point out the key points of the currently developing situation in particular and hope that the Soviet Union will improve its attitude.</p>
<p>The delay in resolving the Northeast problem will cause consequences that we do not want to imagine. The restatement of the Open Door Policy generally shows the attitude of our allies, but the current Northeast problem is not a problem that can be solved by restating the Open Door Policy. This originated in Yalta. This is a problem that requires international cooperation to solve! Now is the time for action. We must not all be shortsighted and only seek temporary peace, but instead learn from some of the British former Foreign Secretary Simon's tricks and perfunctorily deal with the matter, so that the fire in the stars will eventually spread. We must remind our American allies not to forget those countless sons and daughters who died on the barren islands of the Pacific, on the plains of China, and in Europe and Africa for their country!</p>
<p>In short, the Northeast problem is a national problem. If the international community cannot resolve the Northeast problem fairly, then the Northeast problem will inevitably harm international peace!</p>
<p>The progress of the "Atomic Age"</p>
<p>Don't let "Wild Horses" hinder it!</p>

<h3>Shanghai Students' Rights Protection Movement to Commemorate Eight Martyrs Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Students' Rights Protection Movement will hold a memorial service for the eight martyrs, including Zhang Xinfu, at Aurora University at 10 a.m. today. Social organizations in the city will send representatives to participate. The presidium of the conference will be composed of representatives from eleven schools, including Jiaotong University, Daxia University, Tongde University, and Guanghua University. After the conference, the team will start marching. In addition to requesting the municipal government to forward two letters to Chairman Chiang and requesting the external office in Shanghai to forward them to Soviet Marshal Shlemin, the conference will also telegraph students across the country and distribute a book to fellow citizens of the city. It is also learned that the students in the city believe that students should concentrate on their studies during the founding period, so they do not intend to waste their studies and will resume classes soon. Also, the Shanghai Women's Association issued a declaration yesterday to maintain the sovereignty of the Northeast. The Shanghai Branch of the National Diplomacy Association also issued a declaration, stating that the Northeast issue is related to global stability and peace, and hoping that people around the world will pay attention to this new issue. Also, the Chinese Poor Students Association and the Student Self-Government Association of New Construction Middle School also issued a declaration of the Rights Protection Movement yesterday. Also, the students of the National Temporary University, 2,200 in total, and the students of the National Jiaotong University, 458 in total, gathered at the gate of the municipal government at 1:00 p.m. yesterday to petition the municipal government for the Northeast issue. When Mayor Qian was out on official business, he sent a representative to receive them and comforted the petitioning students. At 2:10 p.m., Director Gu and all the students retired in formation. The team then formed small groups and went to various places for propaganda. The students of Lin University traveled north along Zhongshan Road, crossed the Waibaidu Bridge and went straight to the Soviet Consulate, standing around and chanting slogans, and pasting slogans on the doors and windows of the consulate. A piece of patriotic sincerity was revealed. At 3:10 p.m., they left the Soviet Consulate and went to the Times Daily Newspaper in Xiejiao Lane to make a demonstration of the same nature. The student organization was strict and the order was very good.</p>
<p>Continuing report: The Student Representative Council of Jiaotong University's Patriotic Movement issued an emergency statement last night, stating that the printed declaration of the Shanghai Students' Rights Protection Movement Conference on the 25th had discrepancies with the previously agreed wording. This is inconsistent with our position. Furthermore, the report stated that the book "The Shanghai Students' Rights Protection Movement Informs Fellow Citizens of the Whole Country" was drafted by students of Jiaotong University, which is also not true. Therefore, it is announced that it will withdraw from the Shanghai Students' Rights Protection Movement Conference and reiterate our pure national patriotic position. If there is criticism from any position, all students of the National Jiaotong University will criticize it with a national patriotic and just position.</p>
<p>Northeast Sojourners in Shanghai Issue a Declaration to Express Their Views</p>
<p>The Northeast Sojourners Association in Shanghai recently issued a declaration and a letter to the elders of the Northeast. The declaration stated: Since the September 18th Incident, the people of the Northeast have suffered hardships and pains during this period. The miserable situation of their displacement cannot be imagined by ordinary people. However, what is the situation in our hometown today? We have no political party and are willing to inform the country and abroad of four points from the standpoint of a Chinese citizen: (1) We are willing to return to our hometown to build a new Northeast. Any domestic and foreign forces that attempt to divide our sovereignty or forcibly establish a special political institution without the consent of the people of the Northeast, and directly and indirectly obstruct our return to our hometown, will be resolutely opposed. (2) Firmly advocate that the Soviet army immediately withdraw from our country's territory. (3) Immediately stop the factional struggle and thoroughly implement economic and political democracy. (4) The number of loyal and capable people in the Northeast is no less than that in other provinces. The government should immediately seek more talent from the Northeast, in the wild and unknown, to participate in the rescue and construction of the new Northeast.</p>
<p>University Professors Association Calls for the Protection of Sovereignty</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Professors Association believes that the situation in the Northeast is becoming increasingly serious. Yesterday, it telegraphed Chairman Chiang and sent a telegram to educators across the country, calling for the protection of the sovereignty of the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Commodity Prices Fell Universally Yesterday; Authorities' Emergency Measures Effective; Rice Purchase Loans Temporarily Set at 2 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the authorities took effective measures to suppress commodity prices, cotton yarn, cloth, and black market gold all showed a general downward trend yesterday morning. The opening price of rice was as high as 26,000, but it did not rise until the close of the market, already falling by an average of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the end of last week. The real reason for this is the implementation of rice merchant loans by the food administration authorities and the sudden drop of 200 to 300 yuan per bag of various brands of flour yesterday.</p>
<p>Draft Rice Purchase Loan Plan</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] According to Special Commissioner Yang's statement to reporters, the number of rice shops in this city has increased to more than 1,600, and the number of rice firms has also increased to more than 300. General grain merchants, due to limited capital, are increasingly hoarding goods as rice prices rise, to prevent being unable to replenish them at the original price after selling. Now the Food Administration Office plans to remedy this through loans, so that they can still supply rice when grain prices soar, while still having sufficient funds to replenish purchases from production areas. When asked about the government's collection of military grain, it was stated that all procedures for collecting military grain were completed before February. Currently, any grain collection is to collect already determined military grain. It is estimated that the total amount of military grain accounts for less than 1-2% of the output of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which will not affect the supply of grain sources.</p>
<p>(Further news) The Food Administration Bureau continued to convene rice merchants in this city yesterday morning to discuss methods for purchasing rice through loans, dispersing only at noon. It is said that the draft has been prepared and will be announced as soon as it is approved. It is also confirmed that this loan will only be available to members of the city's bean and rice trade association who hold membership certificates. The total loan amount is temporarily set at 2 billion yuan in national currency, and can be increased again if needed. Interest will be calculated daily based on the national bank's loan interest rate. Security can be provided by written guarantees from the silver and money industry, shops, and grain merchants. The loan amount will be based on the current rice price converted into national currency, ranging from a minimum of 500 piculs to a maximum of 2,000 piculs. The rice should be stored in warehouses, according to designated institutions, and the goods should be sold to this city. It is also heard that once this method is passed, the food administration authorities plan to discuss with the city's administrative agencies to form a review committee to supplement everything. With such effective implementation, it will not be difficult for rice prices to fall day by day.</p>
<h3>Insurance Association Re-election</h3>

<h3>Telecommunications Labor Dispute Negotiated Again; Both Sides' Opinions Gradually Converge; Employees Agree to Two Methods</h3>
<p>The long unresolved Shanghai Ministry of Communications Telecommunications Bureau and International Radio strike, has been repeatedly discussed by Director Tao of the Postal and Telecommunications Department, Deputy Director Qian of the Telecommunications Bureau, and Director Yu, Deputy Director Lu, and Chief Engineer Lu of Shanghai. A meeting of all department heads was convened at 2 PM yesterday. It was agreed to follow the Ministry of Communications' approved methods for increasing treatment:</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Approved Five Methods</p>
<p>(1) Starting from February, the salary multiplier and basic living standard will be handled in accordance with the Municipal Government's standards. (2) The above basic living standard will be issued according to regulations: 100% for officers, 80% for assistants, and 60% for workers. (3) If the price of rice exceeds 9,000 yuan per picul, a rice subsidy will be issued separately, based on the difference between the average market price of medium-grade rice and 9,000 yuan, and also according to regulations: one picul for officers, eight dou for assistants, and six dou for workers. (4) A one-time special subsidy of 50,000 yuan will be issued. (5) Previous loans will not be deducted. After hearing the news, all employees convened a meeting throughout the afternoon to express their views, and all agreed to items 4 and 5. The adjustment of treatment and living standards is too far apart. The standard of the third requirement that has been held is in accordance with the former, and in order to understand the authorities' difficulties, they are willing to make the biggest concession, reducing the total amount allocated per person to five or fewer. The Bureau-Taiwan side expressed regret that they could not change due to the limitations of telecommunications finance and the Ministry of Communications' orders. It is also heard that employees of various bureaus in other areas have already accepted the resumption of work.</p>
<p>Sawmill Workers' General Strike</p>
<p>The tinplate industry workers in this city requested the capital side, the Timber Industry Association, to adjust wages half a month ago, divided into four levels: 60,000, 80,000, 100,000, and 120,000 yuan. As there has been no response so far, they submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation yesterday morning. Starting in the afternoon, a general strike has occurred.</p>
<p>The Western restaurant and cafe workers in this city have been on strike for three days as of yesterday. In addition, Jeep Cafe joined yesterday. It is reported that the mediation yesterday still did not yield concrete results. It is set to be mediated again at the Social Affairs Bureau today.</p>
<p>Xinhua Bank Strike Resolved</p>
<p>After the treatment of the four banks and one bureau, Xinhua, Zhejiang, Xingye, etc., in this city were adjusted, they also successively requested increases and once went on strike. Xinhua employees requested an additional special allowance of 100,000 yuan for February and an adjustment of treatment starting next month, taking the national bank as an example. After several negotiations between labor and capital, a special allowance of 80,000 yuan was issued, so the Xinhua labor dispute has temporarily subsided.</p>
<h3>Car Owners Can Rest Assured; Unlimited Gasoline Supply</h3>
<p>[United Press Local Report] American gasoline businesses in this city announced: All gas stations have now resumed unlimited gasoline supply, and the temporary restrictions on weekends have been terminated. A few days ago, there were rumors among Chinese people that there was a shortage of oil in this city. According to gas company officials, these rumors are completely unfounded, but they led to a rush to get oil at various gas stations on weekends, making it necessary to take temporary restrictions. Another rumor that gasoline was about to rise in price was also a factor in promoting the oil rush.</p>
<h3>Dance Hall Manager Accused of Treason</h3>
<p>False Town Head and Treacherous Merchant Tried on the Same Day</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Three treason cases were heard by the High Court yesterday morning, and the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Lao Dahua Dance Hall at the intersection of Lin Sen Road and Ma Dang Road was opened by Iraqi national Li Wei. After Italy declared war, the dance hall was regarded as enemy property by the Japanese army and closed. Later, Yuan Shixiang from Dinghai took over as manager, and Chen Huichang from Yong took over as cafe manager, continuing to operate. Now, after the victory of the War of Resistance, Li Wei regained his freedom and asked Yuan and Chen to return the dance hall, but Yuan occupied it and refused to return it. Li then filed a lawsuit with the local court to recover the property; on the one hand, he accused Yuan and Chen of treason with the High Court. After the High Prosecutor's Office concluded its investigation, it filed a public prosecution. After Judge Cao Jun summoned and investigated yesterday, he ordered them to be detained for a later trial.</p>
<p>(2) Ding Bochu, the false town head of Cao Hang Town, collected quilts and other items from the villagers on behalf of the false city security team during his tenure, and then privately embezzled a portion of them. Now, the county government has learned about the previous situation, arrested Ding, and transferred him to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation. After the investigation was concluded, a public prosecution was filed in accordance with the law. The defendant denied embezzlement in court yesterday. Because the witness did not arrive, the court ordered a hearing to be scheduled after the witness was summoned.</p>
<p>(3) Fu Guangyao, the owner of Longchang Copper and Tin Shop on Zhejiang Road, purchased copper coins and nickel coins during the War of Resistance, reselling them to the enemy for profit. Now, after the High Prosecutor's Office concluded its investigation, it was considered to have violated the Regulations for Punishing Traitors, and a public prosecution was filed. However, the defendant argued in court yesterday that what was sold was scrap copper, not whole copper coins. As for the purchase and sale of nickel coins, it was likely done by an apprentice in the shop. The court ordered a retrial at a later date, as the defendant had confessed to the prosecutor's office. The defendant was taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>Bishop Yu Bin Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

<p>Declaration Issued</p>
<p>Member Qu Yue, Yin Tiyang and others proposed a temporary motion: in light of the recent Northeast crisis shaking the entire nation, the primary task of the association is to realize national freedom. Therefore, a strict and firm stance should be expressed regarding the integrity of Northeast territory and sovereignty. They presented a telegram to the chairman. After being read, it was unanimously approved with applause. The declaration and telegram to the government are recorded below. The purpose is to realize freedom and establish a free and equal country. We do not allow for one-sided freedom in the world, nor do we want to see any events that violate freedom. If freedom can be easily manipulated, how can we face the heroic martyrs who sacrificed their lives to defend the nation?</p>
<p>Although the current international and domestic situation is fraught with shadows, and excessive optimism before national construction is not allowed, we must not casually (telegram original text as follows): Humankind's noble ideal is to strive for freedom. We neither wish to be invaded by others, nor do we wish to invade others. We should respect freedom, make good use of freedom, to enhance the welfare of the nation and society, and promote world peace, so that human society becomes a paradise of freedom.</p>
<p>After this eight-year long war of resistance, having paid an extremely heavy price and abandoned the fruits of victory, we should seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for national construction, unite those with free-thinking ideals, and improve the current phenomena that violate freedom. Whether those who want to maintain the status quo or those who want to break the status quo, should awaken themselves and take the interests of the nation and the people as the premise, stand on the grand basis of peace, unity and solidarity, and build a prosperous, strong, healthy, democratic and free nation.</p>
<p>The Free Association has been officially established. In the future, the main task of the Association is to gather comrades who uphold freedom, to realize national freedom, political freedom, economic freedom, and freedom of thought. Through free discussion, peaceful and legal means, we will engage in academic research, current affairs reviews, and social service, uniting into a free and democratic force, establishing standards of public right and wrong, moving forward together on the path of freedom and democracy, so that everyone obtains joyful freedom. This is truly in accordance with the laws of nature, responsive to human sentiment, suited to the world trend, and meeting the needs of the people. We believe that our continuous efforts will achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Government</p>
<p>A telegram to the government was also passed, stating: "To Chairman Jiang of the National Government: Considering the bitter struggle of the whole nation for eight years, and the Chairman's leadership of the masses with tireless diligence, seeking the freedom of the nation and establishing the country on independence, today light shines again, and the rivers and mountains are rebuilt. Therefore, the integrity of Northeast territory and sovereignty must be maintained. Regarding negotiations with the Soviet Union, no further concessions beyond the Sino-Soviet Treaty should be made, to complete the late Father of the Nation's legacy of freedom and equality, and establish a century-long foundation for national construction. Otherwise, fourteen years of tears and eight years of blood will be washed away, and the fruits of victory will be reduced to nothing. How can we face the martyrs above and our descendants below? This association is organized by people who love freedom, to fight for freedom and support democracy. Today, we are established. We send this telegram to appeal, respectfully requesting your wise consideration, and extending our highest respect to the Chairman. The Free Association kowtows."</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Gold, Banknotes, and Securities Simultaneously Decline: Gold Falls to 1.6 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday, gold suffered a drastic fall due to the crackdown on gold prices in Beijing and Tianjin. The rumor that a certain party was collecting gold gradually subsided. The morning opening price dropped to 1.72 million. It was also rumored that the authorities had ordered silversmiths to exchange their holdings at a rate of 140,000, causing it to drop to 1.6 million. The US dollar, due to large settlements from commercial ship imports, turned from weak to strong, which helped the market. Those who absorbed at low prices became more enthusiastic, and it gradually improved. At noon, a sudden rebound occurred, hovering around 1.75 million, a slight setback compared to last Saturday. In the afternoon, it showed slight weakness, asking prices were slightly lower, and trading became idle. Adornment gold still had no listed price. Fine silver was 2,000 yuan. The supply of silver dollars suddenly increased, once falling to the 900 yuan mark. Finally, 1,000 yuan was needed for supply, with a black market discount of 18 to 23 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency: US dollars were extremely weak in the market, with eager settlement of low-priced imports, turning from flat to stable. The morning started with sales at 2,530 yuan, once dropping to 2,420 yuan. Thereafter, it was maintained by someone and gradually improved, once approaching the 2,600 yuan mark at noon before slightly receding. The result was similar to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollars declined and then entered a consolidation phase. The result was that old notes fell by ten yuan and new notes fell by fifteen yuan compared to last Saturday. This is because old notes have a legal value and can be transferred for cotton settlement.</p>
<p>Public bonds and Chinese and foreign stocks, because the guild has been established and has requested the bureau to set up an open market, the industry is waiting for legitimate development and lacks activity. There were no formal transactions, only a few transfers. Category C bonds fell to around 1,700 yuan, and others were also slightly affected.</p>
<p>Although operators of Chinese stocks have requested open trading, a notice from the Securities Exchange in the morning strictly prohibited off-site transactions during the exchange's closure. Public morale became more unsustainable. Wing On Textile opened at 2,400 yuan, American Asiatic at 2,000, and King Fook at 140 yuan. At noon, asking prices were even lower than yesterday, and private transactions were extremely limited.</p>
<p>Foreign stock trading became increasingly deserted. Stockholders were unwilling to sell at low prices, and stock seekers had difficulty finding suitable parties. As a result, prices were similar to yesterday, but the overall trend seemed to be more selling than buying, and the market was stable but soft.</p>
<h3>Rice and Flour Slightly Decline, Oil Prices Drop by 5,000 to 6,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the rice market, the supply from downstream rivers increased, and shopkeepers became less eager to stock up. Supply exceeded demand. White japonica rice sharply dropped by 2,000 yuan, and early thin paddy rice sharply dropped by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Du rice also slightly declined by more than 3,000 yuan. White yuan and foreign indica rice dropped by more than 2,000 yuan. The oil market continued to have supply from Qingdao, dropping another 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Flour continued to decline, slightly dropping by 500 to 600 yuan. Soybeans dropped again by around 2,000 yuan. Soybean cakes followed, slightly dropping by 300 yuan. Bran also slightly declined by 500 to 600 yuan. Only raw peanuts remained relatively strong. Due to softened morale, all grains declined in unison.</p>
<h3>New Keemun Tea Enters the Market: 215,000 per Package</h3>
<p>The Keemun black tea produced in Anhui province is excellent in "color," "aroma," and "taste." During the enemy occupation, transportation was difficult. Although people in the industry tried to transfer and ship it to Shanghai, most of it was old stock that had been stored for many years, and the quality had deteriorated. After the restoration, transportation routes gradually returned to normal, so new Keemun tea could also be seen. Recently, nearly a hundred pieces have been sold by Zhenhe Tea Company, priced at 215,000 yuan per package, no different from before. However, due to variations in quality, there is a clear trend of tacit support. For other varieties, with new goods yet to arrive and old goods nearly exhausted, everyone is optimistic.</p>
<h3>Silk Trade Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was uniformly weak. In the artificial silk market, the spot price for first and second grade goods from the Great Bridge brand was 2.25 million yuan for sales in the morning and 2.2 million yuan for purchases. In the afternoon, it was once 280,000 to 300,000 yuan, but it receded again, making the original price in the morning. Bank bills were not active. Raw silk was also weak. The transaction price for the top grade of five groups was 2.55 million yuan, about 50,000 yuan less than the previous day. Habutai remained stable. Silk fabrics declined along with raw materials, and transactions were quiet. American Asiatic quilt covers were 75,000 yuan lower than last weekend. Da Cheng crepe was slightly weaker by one hundred yuan. The selling prices of Hong Kang black and white crepe and Lin Ji wax feather gauze did not fluctuate much.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Sell Briskly to Merchants</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of woolen fabrics and wool textiles to merchants have been quite brisk. Merchants from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, North China, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Nanjing, Wuhu, and Hangzhou all want to buy goods. However, they are all limited to high-end fine wool goods, and both men's and women's colors are transacted. Eight or nine out of ten choose domestic factory products, especially the brands of Zhanghua, Yinfeng, and Xiexin.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Cloth Turn Weak; Spinning and Weaving Sales Also Slightly Lower</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was fairly stable, and its process was similar to the weak-at-first-and-strong-at-last trend of last Saturday. In the morning, morale was very weak, and 16-count Guangming yarn once dropped to 930,000 yuan. Subsequently, as competitors bought in succession, the price rose again, closing at 1.02 million yuan at 12 o'clock, the high price of the day. All other counts of yarn, both coarse and fine, first fell and then rebounded. The result was not much different from last weekend, and the trend can be described as stable with a slight upturn. Yesterday was the regular yarn selling period for the Spinning and Weaving Company, and the price was tens of thousands lower than the previous period. 42-count double-strand Xiantao yarn was already available for sale. It is expected that the demand for double-strand yarn this week may be slightly suppressed as a result.</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot cotton transactions became more brisk. The Spinning and Weaving Company continued to purchase heavily, purchasing 500 to 600 pieces of US cotton 42-count raw material middling, 200 pieces of Dazhong collection cotton, and 200 pieces of Sanyu town cotton. All of them were factory delivery prices. Cotton dealers traded 100 to 200 loads of Zhoupu seed cotton. In addition, private yarn mills are still waiting and seeing, and have not taken action. The price increased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth trading was sparse. Merchants sold when prices were high, and medium-grade cotton cloth fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The desire to raise the price of colored cloth was weak. The cost of dyed goods, with fuel prices rising steadily, accounted for most of the factory prices quoted previously. Coal is inconvenient to transport, and dyeing and weaving factories cannot reduce costs.</p>
<h3>Timber Stable but Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday's timber market was stable but soft. Market prices varied, and most sellers, seeing that financial commodity prices had fallen, were quite disheartened and sold secretly. However, some still refused to sell and continued to be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Fuel Market in Great Chaos</h3>
<p>Coal Prices Rise Endlessly, Fuelwood and Charcoal Are Similarly Driven Higher</p>
<p>Coal: Since the beginning of this month, the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee ordered that merchants must obtain approval from the committee to purchase and transport coal from other ports, and may not handle it privately, the amount of coal arriving in Shanghai has sharply decreased. Everything depends on maintaining a small amount of stock. Therefore, the owner's asking price is endless, and the offer price is difficult to approach, and there are few formal transactions.</p>
<p>Fuelwood and Charcoal: Due to the sharp rise in coal prices, sales gradually expanded, and some fuelwood and charcoal operators took the opportunity to raise prices, and the market quickly advanced. Huangyan steel charcoal was transacted at a high price of 10,500 yuan per load. Hexi Jiang charcoal was 9,500 yuan, and Louzi Hangzhou charcoal was 8,500 yuan. Chestnut fuelwood was even scarcer. Miscellaneous fuelwood was 2,900 yuan, and pine fuelwood was 2,600 yuan. There were a few boats of split tree fuelwood, priced at 120 yuan, 150 yuan, and 180 yuan per tree, with each tree weighing four to five or six pounds.</p>
<h3>Suppression of Speculative Trading</h3>
<p>Securities Exchange Issues Notice</p>
<p>The center of the speculative market in this city, the Securities Building, was repeatedly suppressed by the Financial Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance stationed in Shanghai, together with the police department, and the telephones of various companies were dismantled. This speculative market has virtually stopped. Now the Chinese Securities Exchange has received an instruction from the commissioner's office, reiterating the ban and instructing the various speculative companies to take suppression measures separately. The exchange's chairman Du [name redacted] has issued a notice, which is briefly excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>"Case received from the Shanghai Financial Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance stationed in Beijing and Shanghai, Shanghai Finance Special No. 4534, which states: 'Article 7 of the Regulations on the Handling of Exchanges in the Beijing-Shanghai Area stipulates that "During the liquidation period, exchanges may not engage in any further trading activities (omitted below)". Subsequently, it was reported that within the Chinese Securities Exchange Building in this city, various brokers and securities companies were still buying and selling, manipulating speculation, etc. on gold, foreign exchange, and securities on behalf of customers. Personnel were immediately dispatched to suppress and inspect the account books. The results of the inspection are listed in the following sections: (1) Confirmed that they are still buying and selling gold securities on behalf of customers. A total of 81 companies submitted account books for inspection. (2) Confirmed that they are still buying and selling on behalf of customers, but refused inspection or concealed account books, 31 companies. (3) No responsible personnel in the room, unable to inquire, 5 companies. (4) 8 companies that have ceased operations or have not yet opened. (5) 11 other companies. Currently, although these companies have temporarily disappeared, it is feared that they will become playful over time and will inevitably become active again. In order to thoroughly suppress speculative manipulation, in addition to requesting the Shanghai Municipal Government to remove all telephone lines from the securities companies in the Securities Building, and the police station to send personnel to patrol and strictly prohibit, before the exchange is allowed to resume business, each firm and each broker (including other firms) must be strictly prohibited from engaging in any speculative trading activities. (1) Those who refuse inspection or conceal account books, (2) Personnel have fled and cannot be inquired, (3) Each firm that does sell or buy for clients, should be ordered to cease operations, and to summon those firms’ leaders who refused to inspection or concealed account books and leaders who have fled, severely reprimand them, and also tell them to clarify the reason, for later verification. It is imperative to follow these orders separately and report." Therefore, in addition to complying with the orders separately, this is to notify the public, and all lessees of this building must strictly abide by them, and must not violate them, and this is a special notice."</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Dispatches Personnel to Investigate Education Conditions of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia: Overseas Chinese Education to be Handled by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Chongqing, 24th] Regarding the long-pending issue of whether overseas Chinese education in the restoration of overseas Chinese should be handled by the Ministry of Education or the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, it is learned that the Executive Yuan's routine meeting decided to order the Overseas Chinese Education Department of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to handle it, and the Ministry of Education will provide assistance. Currently, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has dispatched personnel to investigate the education conditions of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Zhou Shang, the director of the Overseas Chinese Education Department of the Commission, went to Hong Kong and Macau on the 10th of this month to inspect the education cause.</p>
<h3>Recent Conditions of Various Schools in the Capital After the Winter Vacation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch] Schools in the capital that did not have a winter vacation, such as the Preparatory Classes of National Lin Da University, preparatory courses, and National Temporary Middle Schools Numbers 1, 2, and 3, have continued classes until now. Furthermore, the Nanjing Youth Training Institute, which houses 400 war-displaced youths, also did not have a winter vacation; they are studying major high school and junior high school courses and undergoing training. It is heard that this youth training institute will soon be converted into a middle school advancement program to foster talent on a grand scale. Municipal elementary and secondary schools and private schools, which held entrance exams or enrolled transfer students during the winter vacation, all began classes on the 22nd. Middle schools were scheduled to begin classes on the 27th, and elementary schools a day earlier. In the last semester, after the victory of the war of resistance, there were personnel changes in various schools, and students' textbooks were not entirely uniform. This term, all schools have uniformly adopted the textbooks approved by the Ministry of Education and jointly printed by Seven Publishers. Regarding municipal schools, some middle schools used the winter vacation exam results as a screening test. For example, at Municipal Middle School No. 1, over one hundred students were expelled or demoted. At the Municipal Women's Vocational High School, the number of students held back or expelled was also significant. Henceforth, as educational standards improve, students should study especially hard. Moreover, there are only just over sixty elementary schools in the entire city. The original number of school-age children was already high, and with the return to the capital and the repatriation of residents, the number is gradually increasing. It is heard that the municipal elementary schools have as many as eighty students per class, and still cannot accommodate everyone. Many parents sigh with regret that they cannot find places for their children to study, and it is necessary to find ways to expand the schools. (Foolish)</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Orders Each Municipal School to Quickly Promote People's Education</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency] In order to thoroughly eliminate illiteracy in the city and promote people's education, the Municipal Education Bureau previously ordered all municipal elementary and secondary schools to establish such programs in accordance with the bureau's established methods. However, as many days have passed, some have still not complied. Therefore, another notice has been issued to each school to prepare quickly and avoid further delays. As for the expenses for jointly running people's schools, starting this month, a temporary subsidy of 5,500 national currency will be provided for each class.</p>
<h3>Brief Reports</h3>
<p>Xu Songming, the president of National Tongji University, took a plane to Shanghai on the 14th of this month regarding the school relocation. He is currently discussing the issue of school buildings with relevant parties and actively promoting the move. It is hoped that results will be obtained soon. The time for the entire school to relocate to Shanghai is estimated to be in the summer of this year. The previous rumor that Xu Songming would go to the Northeast did not materialize.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Xiaoying, the founder and president of China Women's Middle School in this city, arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong a month ago and is actively promoting the reopening of the school. It is scheduled to reopen classes at the original site on Lin Yin Road, South Shanghai, on the 25th of this month. It is heard that the school has established a new board of directors, inviting Wu Tiecheng, Hu Wenhu, Huang Shaohong, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Lin Bingyan, Ma Chaojun, Tao Guilin, Yang Hu, Chen Yiyun, Li Dachao, and others to serve as board members. Furthermore, the school's alumni association will hold a tea reception at the China Science Society on the afternoon of the 24th to welcome President Wang. Many teachers and students will attend, and the atmosphere is expected to be very joyous.</p>
<p>Since Zhou Feicheng took office as the principal of the Municipal Gezhi Middle School in this city, he has been striving to reorganize the school and make every effort to recover all of the school's old buildings on Beihai Road. To celebrate the anniversary of the return to the school, a grand celebration is planned for mid-next month. The celebration will include group exercises, scout inspections, small ball and basketball demonstrations, and other events.</p>
<p>The Shanghai division of National Fudan University originally planned to move back to Jiangwan after the start of the semester, but the Chongqing headquarters has not yet allocated funds. Therefore, classes this semester may still be held on Hede Road. Registration is today.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Alumni Association of National Beijing Normal University held its second board meeting yesterday morning at the World Society on Lin Sen Middle Road. Board members Tao Jue, Xu Zhi, Lin Sushan, Yu Xueyang, Chun He, and others attended. Several important motions were discussed and approved, and Li Shizeng was appointed as honorary president, and Weng Wenhao, Yu Feipeng, Qin Fen, Zhang Boling, Wu Yifang, Li Shuhua, He Bingsong, Ma Xulun, and fifteen others were appointed as honorary directors.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Qingbai will face Longjie. The latter defeated the British Navy in the preliminary round, showing considerable momentum, but without much real ability. Facing the strong Qingbai this time, it will inevitably be eliminated.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Italian Community will face Yongan. The Italian Community will undoubtedly win. Donghua will face the Soviet Union, which overcame India in the preliminary round. It is heard that the Soviet Union may reorganize its lineup, but with Donghua's strength, there is no need to fear them. Another match is the Jewish team against the Korean Community, which is also a very exciting match. The complete schedule for this week is recorded below:</p>

<h3>Shan Team's Main Player Absent, Suffers at the Hands of Giants</h3>
<p>Green Forest Barely Beats Renyu by One Point</p>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere inside the basketball hall was feverish, with no fewer than three thousand spectators, making it a grand occasion. All matches proceeded smoothly.</p>
<p>In the first match, the Green team of female soldiers, with its elite force and determination to win, faced the V team, which had previously resisted the Green team forcefully. The Green team repeatedly scored in difficult situations. In the first half, the Green team led 11-5. In the second half, the Green team gradually developed its advantage and won 30-12 at the end of the match.</p>
<p>Next was the match between Green Forest and Renyu in the second division of Group A. Each team gave its all, as the outcome was related to the future of the championship. After the start of the match, the score fluctuated, with the difference constantly within one point. In the first half, Green Forest maintained a 18-17 lead. In the second half, Green Forest came out strong and took a 30-23 lead in an instant. Renyu called a timeout. The score narrowed again, 37-35, the atmosphere was tense beyond compare. Finally, with Chen Weiyuan's free throw, time expired, and Green Forest narrowly defeated Renyu 37-36. From then on, Green Forest, Renyu, Red Team, and Desheng all had a record of one loss, creating a complicated situation.</p>
<p>In the final match, the Oil team faced the Giants in the first division of Group A. Unfortunately, the former's main player, Ma Canxi, had left Shanghai, and the entire team lost its soul. However, in the first half, they tried to rally. Chen Qingjiang and Lin Weicong's small passes made the Giants feel helpless. Therefore, in the first half, the Shan team was still able to take a one-point lead, 21-19. After switching sides, the Giants frequently substituted fresh troops, and the Shan team was already showing signs of fatigue. Therefore, they allowed the Giants to do as they pleased. Carson's excellent shooting was also frightening. As a result, the Giants scored 39 points, and the Shan team scored 29 points. The Shan team suffered at the hands of the Giants.</p>

<h3>Ten Major Scientific Events of 1945</h3>
<p>— Mu Wu</p>
<p>The American Scientific Society recently selected the ten most important new inventions or advances in the scientific community in 1945, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The atomic bomb – broadly speaking, the successful release and practical application of atomic nuclear energy.</p>
<p>(2) The discovery and verification of transuranic elements, i.e., elements with atomic numbers 93, 94, 95, and 96.</p>
<p>(3) The application of the new drug "Streptomycin."</p>
<p>(4) "Variable Time Fuse," or VT fuse, the "inexpensive computer" for artillery shells and bombs, which can automatically detonate near the target. (Manufactured by the U.S. Army and Navy Departments)</p>
<p>(5) "Loran," a nautical aid invented based on timed radio signals.</p>
<p>(6) The success of psychological warfare, which accelerated Japan's surrender.</p>
<p>(7) The British invention of arsenic antidote Bal, with great efficacy.</p>
<p>(8) Rodenticides 1080 and "Antu"</p>
<p>(9) The successful Soviet transplantation of warm-blooded animal hearts.</p>
<p>(10) The establishment of the National Science Foundation (United States).</p>
<p>There is a notable omission above, namely radar. The secret of radar was released by the U.S. military authorities in mid-August last year, and it can certainly be said to be a major invention of 1945. It is inappropriate not to include it in the table above. The special emphasis on other things, such as psychological warfare, also raises suspicions. We hope that this table can be rearranged more fairly.</p>

<h3>I Still Want to Write, Write...</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>I myself don't understand how I started writing; and the most energetic stage of writing was the year I left school, confined myself to home, and had nothing to do.</p>
<p>At that time, my home was in the bustling commercial center of the city – the Nanjing Road area. Moreover, my father was in business, and the area around my residence was noisy all day long: bustling and clamoring, making it impossible to "hold a pen" and "form a chapter" on the manuscript paper – it was really terrible!</p>
<p>Heaven knows! My "writing" was fundamentally "clueless," yet I learned the style of old writers: every night, I always wrote, wrote, wrote, until dawn, when the sound of emptying the chamber pot echoed through the alleyways... I was still sitting awkwardly under the dim light, writing, writing...</p>
<p>For several months in a row, I slept late and rose late, spending the day as night and the night as day, and I had become pale and thin, not looking like a human being anymore.</p>
<p>"Hey, you really don't have to! I don't see any benefit in you writing until late at night every day. I've never seen you make much money from writing; I think you shouldn't write anymore, it'll ruin your health!...Alas! Are you doing this for fame or for profit?" One night, my mother woke up and gave me this "advice."</p>
<p>This time, I was really stunned and couldn't say a word in response; but, from then on, a big question mark hovered in my mind, which was: what's the use of writing?</p>
<p>If I said I was learning to write for "fame," my "articles" were often discarded in the "wastepaper basket" by the editors of the supplements, with no opportunity to be published, so how could I talk about "fame"? If I said it was for "profit," that was even more pitiful, because even if an "article" was published in the newspaper, the resulting manuscript fee, when calculated at the end of the month, was only two or three dollars. However, the cost of postage, envelopes, manuscript paper, cigarettes, electricity, tea...etc., that I spent on writing was definitely not something that these few manuscript fees could offset. But I still refused to listen to my mother's words, and continued to write, write, write, without being able to say exactly why, what was it for after all?</p>
<p>Soon, the question of "what's the use of writing" was finally answered. That was: several years ago, unable to bear the oppression of the puppet regime, I ran to the inland, eager to breathe the air of freedom, and it was precisely the time when the slogans of "writing going to the countryside" and "writing enlisting in the army" were resounding.</p>
<p>Yes, in the countryside, I saw many "street poems" encouraging the people to bravely kill the enemy, and "popular literature and art" depicting the soldiers on the front lines fighting bloody battles. I also saw in the troops the performances of many plays educating the soldiers, and the popularization of in-depth and easy-to-understand heroic stories of the War of Resistance. And the common people and soldiers, spiritually infected by these articles, were willing to sacrifice themselves for the nation and the country... to die for righteousness, and there were examples of this everywhere.</p>
<p>The function of writing, although seemingly unable to surpass cannons and machine guns, has exerted enormous firepower at least in the sense of educating and encouraging the people! So it is called a throwing spear and a dagger, isn't that what it means?</p>
<p>Originally, writing is not a tool for "gaining fame," nor is it like a commodity to be sold in the market. Its ultimate purpose is to guide this group of miserable human beings into the ideal realm of truth, goodness, and beauty.</p>
<p>The reason why I can live happily today is indeed because I have been infected by the works of those writers who "eat straw" and "squeeze out milk," works filled with enthusiasm for humanity, and understand how to do good and love others. So even if my articles are often accompanied by the editor's "wastepaper basket," I have already understood the meaning of writing, and I still want to write, write... (Que Chou)</p>

<h3>Three "Threes" in Nanchang</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhaoran</p>
<p>Three famines: first, a rice famine, with those starved to death already "having bodies lying everywhere"; second, a house famine, which led to the slogan "a piece of tile is a piece of gold"; third, newspaper offices are experiencing a paper famine, and the people running the newspapers say: "Is Luoyang paper expensive? Is Nanchang paper expensive?" Hearing this really makes people laugh and cry.</p>
<p>Too many: first, too many pickpockets, one must be vigilant against flying hands at any time and place; second, too many teahouses, because the number of those who "think of drinking when hungry" is countless; third, too many devout men and women, they say: "It's going to be terrible if we don't worship Buddha anymore!"</p>
<p>Three wonders: some people often treat Japanese prisoners to lavish meals, but say to the beggars who come to ask for leftover scraps: "Get out, you motherfucker!" This is the first wonder; theaters often have disputes and stage real tragedies, and movie theaters are dilapidated and about to collapse, but the audience is still packed "looking askance" and "listening intently." This is the second wonder; some people spend 15,000 yuan in legal tender for a haircut, while others post notices looking for their children, but write: "My home is as empty as a suspended chime stone, if you find the child and bring him back, I can only thank you from the bottom of my heart!" This is the third wonder.</p>
<p>Three famines, too many, three wonders, adding up to three "threes." The ancients had "three immortalities," but I hope that Nanchang's three "threes" are just "昙花一现" [a flash in the pan], and not "immortal"!</p>

<h3>Reviving Hygiene Education</h3>
<p>— Li Renzhong</p>
<p>From the War of Resistance to the present victory, the original hygiene courses in ordinary elementary schools and higher elementary schools have been abandoned, as if they are not very important.</p>
<p>Our country has long been known as the "Sick Man of East Asia." In the eight years of the War of Resistance, soldiers and civilians have sacrificed, soldiers have died of starvation and disease, and epidemics have spread. The health of the people is far worse than before the war. To save this great disaster, we must rely on direct and indirect relief from medicine and hygiene. However, hygiene education in elementary schools should be vigorously promoted to instill considerable hygienic knowledge and enable students to have a preliminary understanding of disease prevention!</p>
<p>Recently, our school in Shanghai purchased elementary school textbooks. We inquired at various bookstores, but there were no hygiene textbooks. We hope that the authorities will vigorously promote and urge private schools in each city to uniformly adopt hygiene textbooks to increase the health of the Chinese people. This is also the way to strengthen the country and the race. We hope that in this way, one day we can wash away the shame of being the "Sick Man of East Asia."</p>

<h3>Who are the Poor?</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Seeing the winding lines of people scrambling to buy low-priced sugar and kerosene... I can't help but feel a little alarmed. The war has long since passed, but its footprints, its shadows, still control us, plunging people who are used to comfortable lives into the panic of scarcity of materials and soaring prices.</p>
<p>Reading newspaper reports of the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, I know that it has been going on for a long time. As the name suggests, it should of course be of great help to the poor.</p>
<p>So I thought of something else: outside the office window is the Industrial and Commercial Registration Office of the Social Affairs Bureau, which has been making a great profit these days. Upon inquiry, it turns out that they are all pancake vendors, because they have received this registration certificate and can purchase flour from UNRRA. In a single turnover, the profit is substantial, so no wonder they flock to it like ducks to water. However, the pancake is still the same size, the same quality, and the selling price is even more expensive.</p>
<p>Those who should be relieved, those who have the right and the qualifications to enjoy bargain prices, are holding their stomachs and gritting their teeth, teaching, working as minor civil servants, or working as small clerks in shops. But they have to pay high prices to buy expensive pancakes, to buy "bargain products" that have been resold from the hands of idle and crowded people.</p>
<p>Who are the poor? Who are the real poor? If the target is wrong, the whole thing is wrong.</p>
<h3>Social Services: UNRRA Should Ration and Sell Flour Equally According to Household Size</h3>
<p>So That Ordinary People Can Generally Buy and Get Real Benefits</p>
<p>Dear Editor: According to the newspaper, UNRRA is selling flour at low prices without restriction. This will naturally be enough to stabilize the current soaring food prices! But in order to be more reasonable and more universal, I think it should be rationed equally according to household size to be reasonable. In the past, the distribution system of goods under the puppet regime gave some impetus to each price fluctuation. The system of the puppet regime is certainly not good. But the rationing method is indeed not bad, and it may be worth imitating. Now that the household registration has been investigated, if it can be rationed equally according to household size, not only will ordinary people be able to buy generally and get real benefits, but the stimulation to prices will naturally be greater! Moreover, it can also provide some help to the work of investigating household registration. I wonder what the authorities think? Please publish this for the sake of good fortune. Yours sincerely, Longchuan Fisherman Another reader wrote a letter requesting improvement of the bargain sale method, saying: Dear Editor: You are a good gentleman serving us citizens, and we are really grateful. But because we citizens are suffering too much, we have no choice but to trouble you. I am a person who works in a state agency. My salary is not enough to buy two shi of rice. In this time of rising living costs, how can I support my family of three? Yesterday, I saw in your newspaper that UNRRA's important and urgent measures were to sell flour without restriction. This is such a heartwarming good news. It said that anyone can buy, but each unit is a total of twenty bags. Is this something we can apply for? We are a small family and only need one or two bags a month, we don't need so many. Furthermore, with a unit of twenty bags, our monthly income is less than 50,000 yuan, how can we have so much money to buy it? Therefore, I earnestly request the UNRRA authorities to consider the convenience of us citizens, improve the distribution method, so that every commoner's family can buy low-priced flour and all daily necessities. This is such a fair and convenient thing. Reader Jian Bai</p>
