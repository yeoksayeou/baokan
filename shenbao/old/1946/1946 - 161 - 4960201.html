<h3>周恩來昨晚飛返京　傳延安又有新要求　軍事三人會期即可決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕中共省席代表周恩來，九日晚六時十分，偕李敏然及隨員三人，仍乘馬歇爾專機飛返南京，陸定一未回，毛澤東未來。中共留京代表董必武·鄧頴超·李維漢·曾至機塲歡迎，周氏下機後，逕返梅園新村私邸，休息片刻後，卽赴中共辦事處，與董·李諸人詳談返延報告請示經過，聞周氏在延安勾留約四十三小時，除兩夜睡眠不足十一小時外，其餘三十二小時，大多均耗之於吃力之報告，冗長之談話與夫各種緊張之會議，故周氏返京後，神態雖與往日無殊，但精神似極感疲勞。聞周氏將於十日向馬使陳述返延安請示經過，並將與馬使對軍事三人小組會之各項大前提問題交換意見。據消息靈通者言，延安方面已根據周氏建議，提出具體之新要求，其條件中對於東北之要求，除希望修改整軍方案「五與一」之比例外，尚有政治性及經濟性之要求。軍事三人小組會之舉行日期，傳將於十日上午決定，如事實許可，此一會議可隨時舉行。</p>
<p>〔本報北平九日電〕關係機關情報負責人稱：中共就改組政府問題提出之要求，爲將國府委員由八名增至十名，行政院部長之分配，中共要求者爲敎育·社會·內政三部，此外，要求華北四省主席，計冀·魯·熱·察，並附備考，謂倘熱省有問題，則可將東之省分加以調配。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕停戰令頒布後之次日，東北共軍攻擊國軍，同時華北共軍突發動攻勢，此不幸消息傳至首都後，一般關心和平之人士，莫不駭異，但政府態度極爲鎮定，然以今日適逢星期，故官方人士尚保持緘默，希望停戰期限延長之所謂「第三者」，開此噩耗後，尤感衝動。</p>
<h3>東北共軍不遵守停戰令　四路向國軍攻擊　熱河共軍亦沿鐵路進攻</h3>

<h3>社論　救救東印百萬華僑！</h3>
<p>自印度尼西亞獨立運動發生以來，荷屬東印局勢即陷於混亂狀態，雖雙方進行談判，但衝突迄未中止，且有愈演愈烈的趨勢。「城門失火，殃及池魚」，我國僑胞在東印共和國當局控的制區域內者，何止百萬！緬望海外，無時不爲我國百萬僑胞的生命財產焦急。最近華僑慘遭屠殺，全無人道，怎不令人悲憤欲絕！</p>
<p>據外國通訊社消息稱：荷印首府巴達維亞城迤西之坦其隆城，依照五月廿八日荷蘭與東印共和國所簽訂之協定，應由荷軍佔領，乃當東印獨立軍撤退之後，突有恐怖份子於六月五日在華僑聚居之區，實行大規模的屠殺，慘絕人寰。據最初估計，華僑被殺戮者達六百名之多，並有兒童五十名被焚斃，又據最後報吿，事態益形擴大，屠殺變本加厲？華僑罹難者幾達三千人，該區尙有二萬五千人存亡情况不明，華僑區域推毀殆盡，幾成一片灰燼，而馬奧克城東印人民已將華僑全數拘捕。可是荷蘭當局仍坐視不救；我政府雖已提出交涉，但亦尙無保護海外僑胞生命財產的切實辦法。不圖中國抗戰八年，勝利後號稱四强或五强之一，而我海外僑胞竟成被宰的羔羊，凡有血氣，寗不髮指？</p>
<p>慘絕人寰的屠殺旣已發生，我們僅僅痛哭流涕錐心位血，何濟於事！第一步，我們要硏究這事件發生的責任問題。在法理上講，依照五月廿八日的協定，坦其隆城歸荷軍接防，則在東印獨立軍撤退之後，地方秩序與安寧自應由荷蘭政府負責維持，換言之，荷政府對於該處的華僑，應負有保護其生命財產安全之責。而在屠殺事件發生以後，尤應立即設法營救，決不能因爲兇手是東印恐怖份子，就可以推諉責任。我國外交當局向荷蘭政府嚴重交涉，提出懲兇，撫恤，保留我方要求損失賠償之權，以及荷蘭立即採取有效措置，以防止此類事件之繼續發生等四項辦法，可說是起碼的正當要求。但須知目前問題的癥結，不在外交上的折衝，而在採取何種緊急措置，以營救這百萬垂危華僑的生命，不致有續遭慘殺的禍患。關於此點，荷印盟軍當局對於我駐巴城總領事蔣家楝的建議與呼籲，置若罔聞，並不採納，我們覺得非常遺憾。</p>
<p>這次荷印屠殺華僑，雖然是沒有理性的東印恐怖份子所爲，但是在華僑與十著民族間的裂痕，將因此而益深化，殆難諱言。據說東印獨立軍看到荷蘭軍中有若干華僑在內服役，就誤會華僑有「助紂爲虐」的事實，便用屠殺來報復。照我們看法，這種解釋，必非合理。我國僑胞與土著民族，數百年來，相安無事，即平時遭受排擠，也能會垢隱忍，不願計較。今番東印的屠殺華僑，一定別有背景！我們不得不正吿東印人士：我國對於印度尼西亞獨立運動，自始至終，無往而不表同情，本年一月閒聯合國安全理事會討論荷印問題時，我國代表顧維鈞氏對於烏克蘭代表的提議，在原則上因曾表示贊同。所以東印人士應認淸敵友，辨明是非曲直；否則，東印當局不但將激起吾中華民族四萬五千萬同胞的反感，而其獨立運動也就會喪失國際上的同情。放眼看看戰後的太平洋新形勢，東印當局和荷蘭政府進行談判，爲什麼談不出一個眞正的結果來呢？你們要認淸，在今後的太平洋上，眞正同情你們的和眞正能協助你們獨立的，除了向不侵略的中國而外，還有幾個國家？</p>
<p>要之，在我國積極推動海外僑胞復員之際，竟發生此種不幸事件，適足以說明戰後我國海外僑胞所處的地位，匪特沒有改善的希望；而且將來遭遇的危機，方興未艾。我國主管當局爲一勞永逸計，應該設法謀得安善解決辦法，以奠定南洋華僑的百年大計。</p>
<p>說起來够痛心的了！華僑毋負於祖國，而我們實有負於華僑。海外華僑篳路藍縷，開闢草萊，而百年來，一向受人壓迫，飲泣吞聲。好容易祖國血戰，僑胞在精神上似乎可以抬起頭來。然而抗戰期間，南洋僑胞在日寇蹂躪之下，在當地通敵的當局威脅之下，慘遭荼毒，書不勝書，豈獨荷屬東印爲然。不料日寇屈服，盟國勝利，而我們含悲忍淚的華僑，依然要受到更加嚴重的屠殺，這眞從那裏說起！此數月間，越南華僑在法越衝突聲中，受慘殺，納苛稅，大家當還不曾忘記。星加坡華僑亦曾遭英警屠殺，匯款歸國更受限制，而數年來被日寇「檢舉」壓迫的數千華僑，且無生還之望。馬來半島今春土著也大舉虐殺華僑，辱我國旅，殺我僑領，焚我房屋，一片血痕，斑斑猶在。暹羅華僑在今年一二月間也曾發生排華事件，僑胞被害頗多。甚至葡屬的蒂摩爾島，去冬更竟有華僑因反日示威而被當局逮捕的怪事。總之，勝利後的南洋各地，時有華僑慘遭虐殺，財產事業的損失，更無待論。我們不禁懷疑，難道祖國在這次戰爭中同胞的血白流了！我們受了這樣外來的剌激，我們對於存心破壞國內和平而降低我國際地位的那些人，自然只有格外痛心疾首。我們籲請中共軍隊看在海外僑胞的面上，趕快洗洗手罷。我們要以國內的團結力量，救救東印的百萬華僑！</p>
<h3>各地通訊　蘇北共軍調動頻繁　企圖攻我收復區　違背淮陰執行小組調處　白蒲東郊亦遭共軍襲擊</h3>
<p>〔本報南通通訊〕蘇北共軍近來調動頻繁，大有企圖進攻我收復區模樣，共軍近由泰興縣方面調來第二六團·三八團。敢死隊，統由梅嘉生指揮，在掘港·北興橋，騎岸鎭徵兵，餘西二甲鎭方面，有陶勇部約兩個團，配有日式武裝配備，組織農抗，工抗，四日中午十二時在姜灶港附近，及在鎭塲，余沙一帶，有共軍一萬餘人，徵拉民伕，同時又在三圩鎭一帶，結集共軍六個團，於四日晚十時，又開始進攻我觀音山國軍防地，當時國軍沉著應戰，奮勇抵抗，砲聲機槍聲徹夜不息，居民皆清晰可聞。戰斗至晨五時許，共軍漸告不支，終被國軍擊退，國軍並無損失。當淮陰執行小組仍在南通地區調處之時，共軍竟如此作風，實有違背信義，未知小組將如何處理。</p>

<h3>美對菲重要問題　菲獨立前須解決</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕菲律賓獨立在即，然有數項對菲島極關重要之問題，今日尙在美國會中未獲解答。美菲雙方人士主張此等問題，應於七月四日菲島獨立以前決定，故現在力促國會從速行動。問題如下：（一）菲人歸化法案；（二）軍事協助法案；（三）建議將美政府特有之菲律濱證券六百二十萬美元歸還該島之法案：（四）援助菲律濱退伍軍人及其家屬法案；（五）貸款四萬萬美元供菲律濱復興戰爭損害，亟須編製預算。</p>
<p>凡上述及其他多種問題，雖均急待美菲政府解決，然華盛頓及馬尼刺慶祝七月四日獨立大典之計劃，已將完成，美國已以其實現菲律濱獨立之意嚮，通知對美保持外交關係之五十一國，而馬尼刺方面亦已邀請各國派代表至馬尼刺參加七月四日獨立大典。（關於菲島發生變亂之消息，本報昨已首先揭載。）</p>

<h3>補充正規空軍　美組航空後備隊　在全國各基地從事大規模訓練　一旦開戰可動員四百五十萬人</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約八日電〕美國現正組織六千架飛機之「民間」陸軍航空隊，最後並擬擴大此種後備航空員至一百萬人。據陸軍部宣布：此種潛在的空軍，足以補充美國正規軍，即將由二十餘萬人，以一部份時間在全國四十八州各處基地從事訓練，其組織分爲兩部份，即「空軍國防隊」及正規陸軍之「航空後備隊」，均用志願徵兵法招募，與戰爭初期徵募陸軍情形相同。依照預定計劃，空軍國防隊及空軍後備隊將受史特梅耶中將之美國空防司令部指揮，其司令部設於紐約州長島之米契爾費爾特。史氏在第二次世界大戰時任中印細戰區聯合國空軍司令。</p>
<p>航空後備隊計劃，將於七月間實行，駕駛之訓練將在一百三十處軍略基地開始，以後逐步擴大，以至於空戰及空防各方面。紐約市空隊防在第一批訓練之列，該隊已發起七百航空員之招募運動，全國將有空軍國防隊基地八十四處，各部隊訓練每星期數小時，每年夏季並將利用數星期時間作更擴大之訓練。美國平時空軍約八十七萬五千名左右，可由此第二綫空防訓練而達此目標，一旦發生戰爭，此項後備隊外加正規軍可使美國在開戰後十二個月內，動員空軍四百五十萬人。</p>
<p>史特拉梅耶於叙述航空國防軍及航空後備隊對於美國前途之重要時稱，「處此空軍與原子時代，美國空軍之優勢，乃爲吾國氷久和平與安全之最大保證。美國空軍之優勢乃第二次世界大戰之遺產，此項遺產必須保存直至聯合國能保障國際安全時爲止。」</p>

<h3>美決咨文遠東委會　為麥帥爭取權力　五月份佔領日本行政報告發表</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京八日合衆電〕確息：美國刻預備以後手段，向駐華盛頓之遠東委會爲麥帥爭取權力，且曾徵詢麥帥對現已送至東京之擬議中之聲明有何意見與批評。據聞：美方擬公開宣佈此項聲明，以闡明其對麥帥執行佔領日本政策之所操立塲，並將特別指出遠東委會之權限，以及關於遠東委會在何種範圍內可反對美政府直接頒予麥帥之訓令。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京九日電〕麥帥今日發表五月份佔領日本行政報吿書，分析日本解放後之民主逐步進展情形。略謂，日本旣不欲革命，亦不欲反動，僅欲有秩序的進步。日本人民之心理顯欲避免趨向極端，旣不左傾，亦不右傾。本年四月日本普選，日政府及聯合國軍事當局均未加以干涉，日人得以自由選舉，數十年來尙爲初次。彼等選擇寬大之中間路線，日本人民對佔領軍繼續保持良好態度，日本已在走向將來樹立負責及孚民望政府之路徑踏上初步。惟日本政局尙變化多端，政黨及候選者之重重疊疊，反映過渡時期之混亂。戰時政黨一切活動，均遭政府嚴格統制，此際束縛解除，政黨之活動乃趨沸騰。支配今後數年日本政治生命者爲何事，目下尙未明白確定，最後黨綱爲何，亦尙待草擬。惟有一事已可確定者，即日本軍閥與財閥對於日本政治進展之抑制，業已大部份解除。日本不復爲「警察的國家」矣，軍事操縱政治之力量，已同歸消失矣。一月四日肅紀令發表後，黷武及極端國家主義份子，大部份已遭罷黜，其議員資格亦均已取消。</p>

<h3>可怕的細菌武器</h3>
<p>成本比較原子彈小得多　放射效力超過毒氣千倍</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦八日電〕倫敦街頭本日舉行勝利閱兵式，規模之大，在聯合各國勝利祝典中，當首屈一指，午前十時，英王偕后曁伊麗薩白與羅絲兩公主，乘坐露頂四輪馬車，在羣衆歡呼聲中，自白金漢宮出發。國王穿海軍元帥軍裝，皇后穿紫紅色禮服，帽上飾以鴕烏羽，雍容華貴。四輪馬車由溫德莎名駒拖曳，兩旁有制服鮮明之侍衛保衛。同時英各界名流聞始到達官方大看台，該臺飾成乳酪色及海靑色，棟柱上飾以各種軍旗，爲英帝國及各自治領之象微。馬爾街沿街即軍隊游行之處，聯合國國旗在細雨濛濛中飄揚。前首相邱吉爾及現任首相艾德禮蒞臨看台時，羣衆熱眾烈歡呼，歷久不斷。軍兵兩縱隊在陰沉欲雨之天空下，開始自營房出發，展開長達十八英哩之游行。在機械化部隊之前，爲若干露頂汽車，乘坐英帝國各軍隊司令。蒙高茂萊行經之處，羣衆大聲歡呼。皇族全體入席後，英國國旗於樂聲悠揚中降下，代以皇旗。去年聯軍在諾曼第登陸後十日，英王親臨橋頭堡視察，戰塲用以歡迎英皇者，即爲此旗。威斯敏斯德古寺鐘聲悠嗚之時？首批步兵部隊已接近官方看台，其中包括聯合各國部隊，即中·美·法·比·捷克·荷蘭·挪威·巴西·墨西哥及外約但各國士兵，步兵在夏林十字街口等待機械部隊時，羣衆大爲興奮。糖果捲烟自各處向士兵頭頂飛來，宛如小型炸彈，繼之橘子蘋果山芋等「大型炸彈」，香蕉最爲風光。洒滿之茶盞不斷自樓窗口遞下，由樓下之羣衆傳送士兵解渴。此種同情之表現，使軍隊大爲感動。最後在極度宣鬧聲中，機械化縱隊開到，游行繼續進行，由摩托化部隊開路，沿白山街折人馬爾街，馬爾街為檢閱之中心地點。機械化部隊之行列甫過，又有奇觀呈現眼前，即皇家空軍飛機三百零八架穿過雲務，作驚人表演是也。其時機聲隆隆，恍如英倫之戰又在發作。入夜倫敎光燦奪目，如同白晝，百枝探照燈在空中四射，更有烟火助興，益使人民樂而忘返。</p>
<h3>英軍留營祝捷　埃及發生　反英暴動</h3>
<p>到處投擲手溜彈　總罷工未成事實</p>
<p>〔路透社亞歷山大八日電〕英軍今日僅在軍營內慶祝勝利，以避免發生事端。亞歷山大工會通令總罷工，經埃總理薛特基採取强力制止辦法，始未成爲事實，然全市數地仍有投手溜彈等個別之事件發生。西第迦勃區警察發見手溜彈一籃，有兩枚燦炸，某正在建造中之房屋，亦有一枚爆一炸，傷工人四名。英軍數名於返營時遭人投彈，被傷四名。另有英兵二名夜間在街頭爲埃人六名團毆。今日市街上不見英兵，營門均緊閉，市內有小規模之示威二起，均經警察驅散。</p>
<h3>家居藉傳影機　觀看熱鬧場面</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕數哩外之人民不獲參預盛況者，皆利用傳影機，觀看遊行熱鬧場面，一百七十哩外之　海德地方居民，亦能自傳影機中看到倫敦勝利遊行之景象。</p>

<h3>青年軍光榮復員　第一批今午抵滬　顧副師長招待記者報告經過　明日美琪大戲院舉行歡迎會</h3>
<p>全國青年軍已開始復員，在東南區之二〇八師，二〇九師已在杭集中，將於今日起，分批輸送回籍。上海總隊第一批復員青年軍二千餘人，定今晨自杭乘列車來滬，約於下午一時可抵北站。先行來滬佈置一切之「設營」先頭部隊，則已於昨日來滬，在楊國浦復興島等處布置營房。</p>
<p>報告編訓復員經過</p>
<p>該軍二〇九師副師長顧蓉君，特於昨日下午三時，假大東酒樓招待本市新聞界，報告東南區青年軍編組訓練及復員之槪況。顧氏先行報告青年軍成立之經過，謂：當卅三年敵冠發動灑下桂戰事，我國內局勢趨於極端緊張之際，最高統帥，於卅三年四月廿四日發動十萬青年受號召感動而從軍者，共十三萬人，經檢騐合格者，八萬六千餘人，編為九個青年師（二〇一師至二〇九師）及兩個獨立團，在東南區成立二〇八·二〇九二師，由軍委會東南分團選拔軍官教練，於去年正月初開始籌備。當時東南區參加之青年軍，共三萬二千人，考試合格者為二萬八千人餘人，最高統帥於是時並頒布青年軍編訓三原則，一·選拔最優良幹部二·以最快時間編訓完畢；三·短時期內達居優良技術；每師配合三團及一獨立團，連同普通兵（伙夫·傳令兵·勤務兵等由師管區徵發）兩師，人數合共有三萬六千餘人，相等於普通編製二個軍之人數。經三個月之努力，一般軍事教育已全部訓練完成，此不獨東南二師於此短時期內編訓完成，即全國九個青年師，亦均同時如期完成。蓋青年軍素質極高，益以教育優良，遂得達成此空前效果。</p>
<p>一度準備接收臺灣</p>
<p>去年八月勝利告成，二〇八·二〇九師奉命徒步至福州集中，準備接收臺灣，全體青年官兵徒步一月，抵達福建南平，以大本營改變計劃，復奉命向浙東移動。二〇八師駐富春江一帶，二〇九師駐人餘姚紹興，並同時實施預備軍官教育。青年軍軍政二幹部，則由蔣經國氏在江西主持訓練，幹部人員一部份在青年軍中挑選，一部份在外面吸收，亦早已訓練完成。</p>
<p>升學轉業分別實施</p>
<p>青年軍之復員，原定尚須延遲一年，惟以青年軍中，大部為中學生亟須提早升學，如將多數青年留於部隊內，耗費其求學光陰，似太可惜，故決定提早退伍。除二〇七師外，其餘各青年師一律復員，根據各人志願，願升學者升學，願就業者就業，願留營者仍留營。其詳細辦法，於復員前已計劃城，現並已開始實施。</p>
<p>至復員之運輸問題，東南全部青年軍，分為海洋總隊及長江總隊兩部。海洋以上海為第一目的地，長江以南京為第一目的地。</p>
<h3>對航業界護權運動　杜月笙發表意見　希望朝野一致平心靜氣　共商兩全辦法</h3>
<p>本市航業界最近因聞最高國防會議決定「將南京漢口蕪湖九江四處航行權暫行開放一年」，以為有辱國體，威脅國內航業生存，紛紛表示反對，帬情頗為激昂，記者為明瞭本案真相，與吾國航業界實際情形起見，特訪工商鉅子杜月笙氏，承杜氏接見，由記者提詢下列諸點：</p>
<p>（一）前日報載輪船業同業公會於昨日召開緊急會議，是否先生主席，其會議結果如何，杜氏答稱：輪船公會整理改組，近甫成立，雖承理事會推選鄙人為理事長，但因本人體弱事繁，猶未允就職，現因輪航同業與其他航業團體，發生護權運動，輪船公會重要理事數人，昨日特來敝寓晤商，並敦促本人早日就職，本人以臥病在床，僅能簡單交換意見，並未舉行正式會議。（二）請問先生對於本案有何意見，承答吾國船業之具體計劃，聞曾有多次之商討，此觀於蔣主席所著「中國之命運」一書，特別強調提明「十年之內必須完成三百萬噸之航運計劃」一端，即可知維護航業，實為旣定國策，無間官商，利害與共，此次國防會議，對於京·燕·潯·漢四地暫行開放一年之決定，在政府或別具苦心，但航業界所感應響，亦確甚重大，鄙意以為吾國經濟現當嚴重關頭，所望朝野一致，平心靜氣，共商兩全辦法，以克服困難，漸圖復興，而非交相責難所克濟事，聞宋院長已返滬，鄙人甚望航業界推舉代表當面瀝陳種種困難，蒙宋院長虛衷接納云云。</p>

<p>中午休息，下午二時　續舉行，中間捕入南市體育塲及上海國術社表演國術，當塲由指導劉橞生親自主持，節目計有徒手·單人·雙人·器械·及石担舉重等表演，極為精彩。</p>
<p>田徑節目，下午有男女決賽十六項，競爭劇烈，茲分錄角逐情形如下：</p>
<p>女子決賽</p>
<p>女子五十公尺，六人及格，當開始之初，袁品禮步伐輕盈，在卅公尺處，咬緊牙關，首抵白線，林建秀落後二公尺之遙，成績八秒三，百公尺與二百公尺兩項冠軍均為林建秀所獲，跳高荘銘義以東方式之姿勢得冠軍，袁品禮屈居次席，八磅鉛球荘銘義一二兩次　去，未見得意，不料在第三　中，竟以八米〇三奪得首名，袁品禮第二。</p>
<p>男子方面，百公尺獲決賽者六人，黃瑞　起步最速，談清與朱沙飛較為迂緩，至五十米時，黃瑞棣領導帬雄，膄腉一切，至八十米談請腳下加緊，越黃直達終點，成績十二秒二，黃瑞棣相差一步，獲第二，朱沙飛勉獲第四。</p>
<p>中距離跑</p>
<p>中距離四百公尺十二人逐鹿，槍聲起處，沈哲民一馬當先，張之青緊隨于後，跑畢半程，談清放大腳步，追出餘子，某後勁之可畏，與當日之戴淑國不相上下，談清首破白線，功夫五六秒六。</p>
<p>八百公尺萬金生起步前等，林燦然追隨不放，至四百米處，林燦然與萬金生火併甚劇，林究竟後力充足，先達終點，楊松根在最後十公尺，超出萬金生，成績二分十三秒八。</p>
<p>跳高標槍</p>
<p>跳高，張邦綸在第二跳中得一米五二，王裕光在第三跳中，拼命一躍，得一米六六七〇得冠軍，洗白銘幸獲第二。</p>
<p>標槍　王學武與朱子卿二人對抗，致失去不少競爭興趣，王學武順手擲來，即得五十二米，毫不費力，惜王因腳抽筋，否則不難破五五米關。</p>
<p>萬米決賽</p>
<p>萬米決賽，參加者長跑健將甚多，興趣濃厚，由蔣湘青發令，須繞塲跑廿五圈，啞吧樓文敖一馬當先，劉廣發緊隨不捨，但第六圈後，劉即不支後退，結果啞吧以卅六分八秒三之成績獲得首選，第二劉廣發，落後約六百米。</p>
<p>一百公尺決賽，為最後節目，朱沙飛一路前導，不幸在最後三十米，被談清超過，談卒以廿四秒九之成績，首達終點，朱居第二。</p>
<p>綜觀昨日成績，因氣候酷熱，風勢過大，顯受影響，故未見特出，要以男子四百公尺，標槍，跳遠及三級跳等尚差強人意。</p>
<p>男女冠軍</p>
<p>男女總分，男子冠軍，談清共得十七分，渠包　短距離三項第一，殊為難得，亞軍王學武十三分，季軍宋子卿十一分。女子袁品禮十六分得冠軍，林建芬與荘鋁義均為十五分，並列亞軍。按男子冠軍談清，亞軍王學武，女子亞軍林建秀，均係青年六分團健兒，競賽完畢，由田徑委會主席沈昆南給獎，男子冠軍獲吳市長銀盃，獲教育長錦旗，亞軍獲吳主委銀盃，谷財局長立　，　軍得　表中學錦旗，程　　銀　，女冠軍得吳市長銀盃，祝地政局長銀盾，趙工務局長　　，亞軍二人分得宣司令錦旗，奚　　　　，曹書記　錦旗，及上海徽章廠銀盃，最後由總幹事致謝。至五時畢始告圓滿功德。</p>

<h3>港遠征軍再傳捷報　星東大勝西聯隊　結果四比一上半時各得一球　比賽緊張劇烈長力判分勝負</h3>
<p>香港遠征足球星東聯隊，昨日下午在盛署之下，與滬上西人精銳西聯蜀對　於逸園，球迷傾巷來觀，較首塲更多，計約二萬餘人，情況更形熱烈，裁判張樂，巡邊員陳吉祥法達夫，逐鹿結果，上半塲一比一，未分勝負，下半塲張金海中的，黎兆榮雙捷，結果四比一遠征軍再造勝績。兩軍出塲陣容錄後：</p>

<p>格里非司　奧列維拉　鐵伏尼下　韓尼波上</p>
<p>潘脫遜　麥其當　勞勃司托夫　卡洛列區　羅柴遼下　雷米迪上</p>
<h3>昨勝戰負關鍵</h3>
<p>昨日比賽形勢，緊張精彩，勝負之數，完全決於長力，上半時西聯全力應戰，星東幾為所窘，屢攻不入，球迷皆為星東球運不佳担憂。鮑實仲老將威風，救險球無數，下半時西聯已精疲力盡，再失一球，全軍遂潰。上下半時形勢完全不同，星東獲勝，年青力壯，長力勝人也。</p>
<h3>上半時無勝負</h3>
<p>五時卅分鳴笛開賽，遠征軍開球，張金海撥送馮景祥，景祥帶球疾進，為奧列維拉所阻。西聯反攻，黃毛勞勃司托夫深入禁區，候榕生殺出解圍。未一分鐘，鄧廣森左傳，黎兆榮臨空急射，姿勢絕佳，秦鮑實仲輕輕救出。麥其當卡洛列區雙管齊下，許竟成急退守，西聯無功而返。二十分鐘時，小黃毛橫衝直撞，竟然叩門，朱兆恒撲救，僅着一手，幸中橫木，未遭毒手。混戰至卅七分鐘時，雷米迪獲得接濟，深入腹地，六七碼處打開星東城門，一比〇，西聯首開紀錄。是時韓尼波下野鐵伏尼入代，遂為星東所乘，張金海立刻回敬一球，一比一，上半塲未分勝負。</p>
<h3>西聯一蹶不振</h3>
<p>休息過後，星東調整人馬，劉松生與馮刊勝相繼入補羅郭兩前衛，西聯亦以羅榮遠挨出雷米迪，再行衝突，西聯漸露疲態，客軍氣盛，廿分鐘時馮坤勝於禁區附近，手吻皮球，麥其當主罰，小黃毛越位不計，越五分鐘，許竟成中路進兵，兆榮派司小張，金海舉足力叩，敵門為開，二比一星東後來居上。此時西聯祗有招架，無力反攻，卅分鐘時，老馮叩門，薩文勇不可擋，臥地截阻，金海乘機刦奪，兆榮果告中的，三比一星東又獲一城。最後五分鐘內，李順友左邊線切中，球才着地，兆榮按起一腳，出其不備，球已從右上角入綱，四比一，再來一隻。未幾，法定時間終了，遠征軍以四比一勝西聯。</p>
<h3>首屆排球聯賽　報名展期十天</h3>
<p>市體協排球委員會主辦之首屆上海排球聯賽，男子組分男甲男乙兩組，女子組分女子普通，女子學校亦兩組，自開始報名以來，參加者頗為踴躍，原定今日截止報名，並不日假市體育館球塲開賽，惟現因籃球聯賽乙組尚未結束，且乙組結束後即將鋪建地板，塲地暫時不能應用，經該委員會決定，將是項比賽後移數週，同時將報名日期，展長十天，至本月二十日截止。</p>

<h3>建設上海市文化事業管見</h3>
<p>— 劉咸　（上）</p>
<p>歷史告訴我們，上海自開埠以來，已經百有餘年，中間經過許多次的變亂和戰爭，都很僥倖的保全了，未遭糜爛。即以此次中日戰爭，乃至擴大為太平洋戰爭而論，中經八年之久，上海的地位又如此重要，大有遭遇燬滅的可能，可是頑敵一旦投降，也就化險為夷，依然無恙，這是上海的幸運，也是上海居民的福氣。並且因為抗戰勝利，東京沒落，上海更一躍而為東亞第一個大都市，和太平洋彼岸的舊金山遙遙相對。</p>
<p>據說上海現在有人口四百萬，（此次戶口調查結果尚未公佈，難得確實數字。）是世界第六個大都市，過去因為租界關係，商業畸形發達，市面異常繁榮，華洋雜處，西化很深，真是「洋塲十里，實馬香草，茶樓餐館，酒綠燈紅，劇塲舞榭，紙醉金迷，笙歌達旦，城開不夜，」極物質文明的享受了。可是談到文化建設，上海是貧乏極了，落後極了，倘和歐美的一個擁有四百萬人口的都市比較起來，真有　壤之別了。</p>
<p>「已往不諫，來者可追。」現在抗戰勝利了，租界收回了，治外法權取消了，市政統一自主了，以前籍為阻礙本市文化建設的種種口實，都一掃而光了。我們現在應該把握這可貴機會，高瞻遠矚，懲前　後，好好地建設一個現代化的上海市來，不僅僅是要物質繁華，商業興盛，並且要提高文化水準，增進市民福利，轉移浮薄風俗。</p>
<p>文化事業範圍很廣，我們應該怎樣着手建設呢？我以為應有整個計劃，大宗經費，分別緩急，限期舉辦，其範圍可包括學校，尤其大學，研究所，圖書館，博物館，動物園，植物園，天文臺，美藝館，音樂館，國劇館，歌劇館，文藝館等等，請略加敘說。</p>
<p>（一）學校</p>
<p>上海學校本來很多，不過因為戰事關係，各地治安不良，稍為有錢的人，都搬家來上海住，造成上海人口激增的現象，學生也成正比例的增加了；而勝利之後，政府復員，由內地來上海的更是不少，學生隨家庭來滬的也一天比一天多，而上海的學校，並沒有增加許多，相反的，有些學校因為和敵偽有關係而停辦的也不少，所以無論小，中，大學，都是供不應求，大有人滿之患。為解決青年失學問題，只有請市政府從速多設小學，中學，以應急需。至於大學在上海的原有十餘校，抗戰期內，多數內遷，或被燬壞，私立的暫且不談，國立的復員有待，並且聽說原來設在上海的曁南大學，將來要遷往南京，復旦大學遷往無錫，將來剩下的只有交通大學，同濟大學，上海醫學院，上海商學院，上海音樂學院了。而這些學校，都是帶專科性質的，實際上上海沒有一所科學完備規模宏偉，像中央，北京，清華，中山，武漢一類的國立大學了。上海是我國第一大都市，人口四百萬，國際觀　所　，文化交流中心，依情論理，都應設立一所「為文化而文化，為學術而學術」的最高學府，以應戰後時勢的需求。</p>
<p>（二）研究所</p>
<p>研究所是文化的源泉，是文化水準的最高峯。歐美各國的重要城市，莫不設有許多研究機關，從事各部門學術的研究。像上海這樣的一個大都市，工商發達，科學落後，儘有許多科學的，工業的，市政的，或其他地方性的問題，需要研究，需要解決。中央研究院雖設有幾個研究所在上海，然而大多數是從事地理科學或人文科學的研究，很少對當地問題加以研討。市政府方面為解決許多地方性的問題或工商企業的技術問題，似應有設立許多研究所的必要。研究所在一般有看來是消耗的，不是生產的，然而世界上那一件發明，那一件有益人生的事，不是從研究得來。</p>
<p>（三）圖書館</p>
<p>圖書館是知識的寶庫。上海雖然有好些所圖書館，並且有市立圖書館，不過規模都太小，經費無多，且市立圖書館設在江灣，距市太遠，交通不便，難以充分利用。我以為上海這樣大，人口這樣多，至少要設立一所大規模的圖書館，藏書百十萬冊，會自經委派中央圖書館或北平圖書館之類，普通的閱覽之外，還要供研究之用。此外分館要多設，分佈在市內各要區，如同郵信局一樣，使市民容易得到閱覽圖書的方便，至於專門圖書館，要儘量多設，務使古今中外的圖書，在上海都能找得到一份，有圖書館才能研究學問，才能對文化有所貢獻。</p>
<p>（四）博物館</p>
<p>像圖書館一樣，博物館也是文化事業的主要部門之一。上海至今沒一所像樣的博物館，外國人來到上海，要想看看中國的文物藝術，簡直沒一個合適的地方，可願去參觀參觀。我主張在上海要趕緊設立大規模的博物館，一則可以表現我國的文明，二則可供人觀覽，收社會教育的功效。還要設立各種專門性博物館，像科學博物館，自然歷史博物館，民俗博物館，衛生博物館，兒童博物館等等，以推廣社會教育，增進市民知識。</p>
<p>（五）動物園</p>
<p>凡是一個現代化的都市，沒有不設立一座動物園的。動物園是活的博物館，以我國國土之大，地方之廣，動物品類之繁，稍加搜求，不難有許多珍奇的品種，養在一起，任市民觀覽，供專家研究，是極有意義的一樁事。可惜我國事事落後，政府也少注意，各處大都市都沒一個動物園。以前上海文廟，兆豐公園，和法國公園內，雖然也曾養過此動物，但設備太簡陋，動物也太少，飼養又不甚得法，結果獅子老虎養養都死掉了。我想上海應該設立一座最現代化最科學化的動物園，規模要像以前德國漢堡的那末大，聘請專家管理，不要用康所產的大熊貓，為世界的稀奇珍品，在上海都看不到，反而要養在美國紐約的動物園內，這真是中國學術界一件可憾的事，因為我們沒有一座好的動物園呀！</p>
<p>上海濱海，海產特多，動物園之外，還要特別設立一座水族館，專養各色各種的美麗水產動物，尤其像神仙魚一類的美術魚盡善盡美，我建議設立一座大規模的水族館，飼養水產動物，一方面有教育意義，一方面可供玩賞，還有經濟價值，一舉數得，是值得舉辦的。（未完）</p>

<h3>卜</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>——那夢一樣的生活，卻不曾引起我淡淡的神往。但是為了這幾個親切而又可愛的人，我願意永久記着這閒情，記着這韻事。——</p>
<p>漢麗的屋子永遠有一種朦朧的夢的情調，即使在夏天，她也不愛拉開那窗上的紗，和門上的簾，何況那時節還是暮春？</p>
<p>於是那靜寂的庭院，低垂的簾幕，在遲遲的夕陽裏，就更像夢境了。</p>
<p>因此我們在漢麗的屋子裏，永遠愛說夢話，荒唐，幼稚，想入非非……自己卻永遠不以為可笑，也不曾覺得疲倦。</p>
<p>那桌上有幾冊書，無規則的放着，像是幾天來無人整理。</p>
<p>「懶孩子，我來替你收拾收拾吧！」昭陰小心的一冊一冊的擺好，隨手拿起一本薄而大的雜誌，說：「讓我卜一下我的命運　。」</p>
<p>她翻開一頁，一張絕美的年青女像，底下註有詩人下之琳的名句：「明月裝飾了你的窗子，你裝飾了人們的夢。」</p>
<p>我們人都笑起來。</p>
<p>「簡直答非所問。」她把書扔了。</p>
<p>「還說哩！答得恰到好處，也只有你配。」漢麗俏皮的溜了好一眼，然後轉過身，輕輕的笑着：「讓我也來試試。」她閉上眼睛，慎重得什麼似的，虔誠的摸了一本，一本棕色的小書，喃喃的說：「第三十六頁，第六行；」然後，她小心的一字一字的讀着：「我沒有冷淡，也沒有批評，也沒有計算……」</p>
<p>多麼不可思議的句子！聽的人沒有反應，因為大家全在思索。還是我自己先跳了起來，叫道：「天哪！怎麼這樣靈？」</p>
<p>我們再一尋思才覺得很對。</p>
<p>沒想到這幼稚的遊戲，竟會引起了人的興趣，尤其是對漢麗，她告訴我說：「你也來試試，就是這本小書，很靈的一本。」</p>
<p>我順手打開一頁，順口說：「我要一個最不吉的數字第十三句。」漢麗為我念道：「啊，那兒才是離思遺忘的仙泉！」</p>
<p>是因為我有太多的回憶麼？然而誰不覺得往昔之可戀呢？</p>
<p>我無言，她們也覺得這一個回答，說像也像說不像又不像。</p>
<p>「輪着我了！」宜卿說。她含笑的揀了一本精製的厚厚的書：第一百零四頁，第十二行。」</p>
<p>然而，當我們去看她指到的地方，那一頁，那一行，恰巧沒有一個字，只有一個標點：「？」</p>
<p>「不靈，不靈，倒底不曾　香燭，所以沒有關帝爺的有求必應。」漢麗把書搶過來，重重的朝桌上一擲。</p>
<p>宜卿臉上的笑容卻漸漸的沒有了。</p>
<p>如此消磨了一個靜靜的暮春的靜靜的黃昏，在那靜靜的屋子裏。</p>
<h3>彫刻室隨筆</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>——彫刻的起源</p>
<p>據考古學者及美術史家的說法，彫刻的發生與發展都較繪畫來得早。這話，姑勿論正確與否。總之，在最古的原始時代，彫刻與繪畫是不可分的。所以我們可能稱之為彫刻與繪畫的「未分時代」或「混合時代」。</p>
<p>從人類的造型的本能來解說彫刻的發生的意義的話：由縱的方面來看，遠如原始，希臘埃及的彫刻；以橫的方面來看，就如今的南洋，非洲土人的彫刻，乃至我們日常所見的小孩們所製作的粘土手工，可說無一不是出自人的本能性的。</p>
<p>人的本能性對於物的「量」和「容積」，下意識間就發生了愛慕，驚異。——大如巍巍的山嶽，小若蘋菓櫻桃，當人們一看到或一拿到手中撫玩的時候，無意識的對它就發生了快感，好感，愛慕的驚異。為滿足自己或將自己所感觸到的事物與剎那間的感情記述下來，於是便就地取材，或取泥揑之　形，或假石刻之為　，或籍字畫之為文……這樣，就所謂人的本能。也就是一般藝術的本能的萌芽。</p>
<p>如前所述：人們為對於物「量」的本能的愛慕心所驅使，而發生了彫刻，再由這原始的愛慕心促成人們的造型慾。在這先天賦與的本能上再融合以外界的美的刺激。於是正式的就此產生了所謂「彫刻的藝術」。換言之，彫刻藝術不但是人類文化的一環，而且可以說是人類文化最古老的一粒種子。</p>
<p>——原始的彫刻</p>
<p>當人類與　類鬥爭的原始時代，他們就用智慧戰勝了猛力。那些由智慧所創造出來的石棒，石斧，石刀，就可說是彫刻藝術的火種。旣後，又經過數千年，在所謂第四成　前期，人類因迫於大時，避　洞穴中，仍以狩獵為生，着獸皮，食獸肉，燃獸油，利用獸骨製成各種日用小道具，閒時在這些道具上鏤以花雕以紋，所彫刻者，大多是利用獸角和獸骨，題材能識者為各種獸形，尚有許多古怪形狀，有若音樂符號者雖不能辯其意，但，刀法與形象均極其古拙有趣。尤以近年在西班牙法蘭西等地發掘出土者——鹿角製成的小刀柄上線刻，使人看了不禁為之神往。它好像告訴我們，人類的生活不僅是為了單純的「物質」。我們應該把精神寄托在某一件具有悠久性的事物上，使我們時常引起甜的回憶和夢的思念。這，是人的本能，是人與獸相異之點，也就是彫刻藝術的真諦。</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛　（十五）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>然後學走路，他告訴廖棟，一個男子漢大丈夫不能老匍匐在人的胯下過生活！</p>
<p>廖棟對於寳鈴的啓示，不能說不受影響，但他究竟還小，還不十分懂人生。雖然十二歲的人，已經高得和十八歲的寶鈴差不多齊了戶，而知識卻還遜於寶鈴，因此他並不太理解寶鈴的意思。有時他哭了，寶鈴笑他，他反覺得寶鈴是譏誚他。自然，有此話他是聽信寶鈴的，譬如念書，他很用功，加上他的聰明，進步非常這快。因為他究竟還是小孩子，他的感傷與憂鬰也便不太深化。所以自從有了寶鈴以後，他漸漸快樂起來，活潑起來！這也許就是他性格潛伏的另一面，而這一面可能是真的；那悲觀的一面，乃是人為環境造成的！</p>
<p>寶鈴來後，還不曾惹過老　娘生氣。廖老　常常有意無意地向老　娘提醒着說：「人不能衝量人呀，誰會想到墨老爺的公子如今作了咱們的記賬員呢？」老　娘見廖老　頗另眼看待寶鈴少不得也躭待着些兒。但是有一次為了寶鈴和廖棟夜間秉燭閱書，久久不寐，老　娘睡醒一覺，還看見他們屋裏燈光明亮，於是忍無可忍地呌了起來。</p>
<p>「你們白天都幹嗎去了？這早晚還不挺屍？點的不是你們的油，對不對？」</p>
<p>寶鈴想回答她：「對呀，點的是老　娘的油，所以老　娘心痛呦！」但是沒有廖棟也不許他還嘴。因為廖棟是知道母老虎的利害的，惹急了她，不敢把寶鈴怎麼樣，廖棟的皮肉又得受苦！於是從此他們不再彰明昭著地點着燈看書了。而白日又沒有空暇，倒是廖棟想了個法子，他把燈放到床底下，他們便坐在地上照樣孜孜不倦地用功。</p>
<p>老　娘很難得有笑臉除非是這一天的生意特別好，或則是她的廖棟逗了她。因為錢財是她的第一生命；兒子是她的第二生命；整日價不是搬着腳指頭算賬，便是千方百計哄着她的寶貝心肝玩兒。在別人的身上，她是一毛不拔，在兒子的身上卻是捨得花！自然，她對於丈夫和自己也不吝嗇，她很會體貼丈夫的生活起居，也很會滿足自己的享受。但比起兒子來，還差上一籌。這麼一來，兒子可被慣壞了！小小廖棟，已養成了一個十足軟體動物型。這些老　娘若不覺得是錯誤，而且努力地繼續着嬌縱的毒素之灌輸！</p>

<h3>每月來貨僅十四萬噸　廠用煤成問題　燃管會將開會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市煤斤供給，大抵仰給於燃管會，而煤號亦有一小部份配到，轉售於民用，惟為數甚小，聞該業疊羅要求燃委會，凡工廠生產用煤，一槪由其經手，轉售於廠家，以維持煤業職工之生計，燃委會將於二三日內開會討論此事，但以工廠界頗多反對，恐難如願，目下燃委會對於本市廠用煤斤之配售，每月可達三萬噸左右，其中國營紗廠絲廠及紙廠約為半數，其餘之半數，則各工廠約一萬噸，各煤號約五千噸，各煤號受配之價可減低一萬元云，公用事業之配煤，如火車電力煤汽及復員用軍事用之船舶，每月需八萬噸，其價當然遠較上開廠用煤為低，據各工業同業公會消息，目下燃委會配煤之手續，雖未能合乎理想，但貨歸廠家自出，品質噸位，流弊尚少，且配價雖較煤號愛配者略高，而領配係屬直接，壟斷把持等情，尚可防止，若槪由煤號領配轉售，恐未必能如此便利，各地破產情形，據聞開灤目下月出三十萬噸，除供給北寧京綏等鐵路用途，及其附近之民用外，每月由秦皇島連至上海十二萬噸，臺灣雞龍煤月出十萬噸，每月可運申二萬噸，此間煤斤之來源，即出於此，凡滬寧滬杭沿線電力廠之用煤，亦須仰給上海之煤委會云，此外如淮南礦可月出三萬噸，除當地須用一萬噸外，以二萬噸運給南京，凡南京至漢口一帶之公用煤斤，即取給於此，華東礦月可出煤二萬五千噸左右，須供給隴海路東段及津浦路北段之用，均不能供給上海云。</p>
<h3>上週米價由疲轉堅　證券交易均挺秀　金價平穩美鈔繁忙</h3>
<p>上週烚赤趨勢尚稱平穩，華股因證交籌備開業，人心向榮，市況挺秀，統債多空活躍，行情忽升忽降，美鈔進口商向黑市扒吸，價告堅挺，外股堅後轉疲。食米始終疲途懈，至週六略見轉機，茲將各業情勢分誌於後。</p>
<p>烚赤　上週烚赤暗市，週初開盤一七九萬元，在銀根緊迫，浮多吐售下步挫至一七六萬元，為本週之最低價，周二徘徊於一八〇萬元左右，週三以外埠金價報升，實銷激增，市勢堅定，週五雖有和平消息，惟部份人士對金鈔仍有看好之見解，逢低吸收，且美鈔盤漲，間接助長買氣，曾上揚至一八七萬元，為本週之最高價，週六收盤一八四萬元，較上週末漲四萬五千元。</p>
<p>外幣　美鈔隨金價進退，週一市勢平庸，曾見二·三二〇元低價，為本週之最低價，週二至週四徘徊在三四十元間，週五以外匯感受約束後，結款頻繁，盤升至二五〇〇元，以週六之二五二〇元為本週之最高價，週六收盤二四七〇元，較上週末漲一四〇元。</p>
<p>華股　週初雖有證交復業之訊，然以銀根抽緊，重入疲途，週二因係端節，市況甚形閑散，冷門股因證交卽將復業，突乏青睞，一致挺秀，週三節後銀根漸見松動，信和紗廠大中章火柴及中纊紗廠諸冷門股以有增資贈股傳說，均續告上揚，熱門股亦盤旋趨高，收盤時因有補空，更形堅昂，週四二大熱哄抬已高，漲力較弛，三小熱有納吸上升較多，冷門股亦各喊高，收市時浮多獲利吐售，稍形下挫，結果全面軋漲，週五熱門股初尚平定，冷門股續旺，後浮多了售，各告下挫，週六全程上落幅度極狹，成交較稀，結果較昨微有參差。</p>
<p>外股　週初受證交即將復業傳說影響，人心頗見振作，嗣以浮多趁高吐售，稍形間挫，週二人心疲弱，成交清稀，腳地軟化，週三初呈頺勢，旋多方乘機活動，逐步回昂，結果除會德豐外，一致見升，週四初開頗形堅昂，後市勢為浮多競吐所扼　，收盤時尚告穩定，週五轉形疲弱，週六人心閑散，除怡和啤酒外，均較昨微跌。</p>
<p>米糧　上週食米來源擁至，市況逐步疲軟，自週一至週五，一路下跌，麵粉亦受米價影響，同告挫落，雜糧大致挻升，惟蠶豆猛瀉，食油供應通暢，價續下跌，食糖市勢平定，惟中砂到旺，續趨下游，週六食米因連跌之後，趨勢轉堅，價均回漲，麵粉雜糧亦趨俏，小麥及生仁疲弱，食油市勢轉堅，食糖穩定。</p>
<p>絲經　今庚蠶訊欠佳，育蠶成本浩大，土絲價見新絲後反呈高漲，以是滬上千經價廉而被青睞，上週內千經因此亦跟隨挺進，總計漲起十五萬元強，廠絲一週間穩持，無甚變化，高勻度亦然平穩。</p>
<p>人造絲　上週內做價一二〇天橋有光現貨，總在一百三十萬至三十二三萬之間，一二〇號美女進退在一百十八萬至二十萬左右，七五號金雞平光，上落做一百三十八萬至三十九四十萬之譜。</p>
<p>綢貨　逐日瀝增，良以工資增大，成本遂高，且現貨缺乏，求供失衡，因此扶搖直上，美亞被面每百條大十五六萬元，大誠格子等　六七百元，盛杭各貨，亦莫不高漲。</p>
<p>現紗　在上週間，初開卽告疲，但情勢尚平穩，以致市上供給籌碼充沛，而津粵等主要客幫，實際銷路無甚發展，執有四十二支藍鳳水月寶光等隻股細紗多頭，心思不安，時起恐慌，絡續在市貶售，市價日趨下　，尤以四十二支跌勢為甚，全星期一之四十二支藍鳳二百四十九萬為最高，星期五之十支長城八十一萬為最低，其過程高低，相差一百六十八萬之鉅，若以支數言，則四十二支寶光·藍鳳·水月三牌，比前週各暴跌三十三至四十四萬，四十支藍鳳跌十六萬，廿支特雙馬跌七萬，十六支光明跌五萬，十支童子軍僅跌二萬，記者前週曾指出粗細紗高低差額，前　有軋籠可能，今已澄實。</p>
<p>布市　週內趨勢尚穩定，客幫與門荘對於桃花女·交通圖·交際花等士林布，因其價格廉宜，需胃獨佳，故情勢較俏，比前均漲三四千元，此外各機布疋咸受外貨　的影響，市勢平凡，但較紗市　勝云。</p>
<p>花市　週內紡建公司及由新等　廠全存觀望，未聞採辦，此外　嘉豐·蘇綸·振新·民豐·慶豐·福新·麗生等民營紗廠，均有零星採辦，致市況得以安定，價比前週約升二三千元，海外紐約美棉期現貸均漲廿八至卅五磅音。</p>

<p>工業調查</p>
<h3>松香之厄運</h3>
<p>— 章柏庵</p>
<p>松香為我國山地大量出產之物，東南方面，如浙之麗龍，籟之婺樂，皖之休祁，閩之建邵等處，均有大量出產，雖無統計數字，相信為數甚鉅，抗戰統計數字，相信為數甚鉅，抗戰以還，以松香為軍用品之一，禁止出口，並與陷區隔絕，故蜂臘與松香，兩者有黃老虎之稱，戰時曾有人將松香黃臘塞入活豬肚內，流入陷區，以博厚利，依此可知此物之重要。</p>
<p>比年來松香之淤塞於山地，比比皆是，加以八年來森林長大，松香生產亦復增加，作者在戰時行經浙閩皖等山地，見山農積存松香者，指不勝屈，當時並有不少化工同志，利用松香製造液體燃料，但實騐結果，祗能充作荻塞爾油，至揮發油類，因炭質與膠質太重，燃料一進汽缸，卽有燃燒不完全之弊，因之廻氣活門，常於凡而線內擱起，且汽缸內壓力甚高，凡而線上之炭膠質卽不易洗滌，惟於兩行程之柴油機，因為無凡而，又係熱車頭，成績尚佳。</p>
<p>作者曾用軟松香，加入百分之八之石灰，作為　皂，以乾　之，得有螢光之芳香族烴類，香味與安息香油，如出一轍。油之蒸餾率，達原松香百分之六十八，水份含百分之五，餘為製皂及焦炭之損失，可知松香之蒸餾油確為一重要之香料。</p>
<p>松香在工業用途方面來講，大部用於造紙，小部用於製皂，次之為松香製品。</p>
<p>松香在造紙用途，不一定需要精製，其餘用途，大多均須精製後，方可備用，精製松香，作業工程，至為簡單，設備雖有繁簡，製作均屬單純。松香在未精製前，稱生松香，業中人所謂「生貨」，生松香製於紫銅蒸餾器內，蒸出松節油，將餾內松香放出，卽成透明清潔之塊狀，美國N松香為最透明，溫州頭水松香，透明程度不及N松香，蓋因提出松節油及部份之雜醇油後，工業應用已無問題，生松香之不能為工業上之應用者，一為渣屑太多，一為含有松節油及雜醇油，故必須蒸餾後方可應用，　前滬地精製松香工業，並不發達，僅小型工廠二三家，產品尚能與外貨競爭，因外貨價值大，國貨雖品質稍差，然亦能應用，而價值相差低一倍有奇，是以外國松香，始終不能發展。</p>
<p>就品質言，於精製技術出入尚小，最大原因，完全由於採收方法之不良，據研究所得，若依科學方法採收生貨，採收後卽予蒸餾，則可與美國N松香一樣透明黃亮，這是因為氧化作用的緣故。</p>
<p>但我國山地之產松香者，科學採收，目前殊不可能，山農旣無偌大資本，改進採收，又不能就地設廠製造，所以在改進品質，尚難辦到。</p>
<p>且松香在滬地，市塲變化，一日數變，山地製造，決難靈活運用，廠商若進山製造，山農必抬高其貨價，如果由山客運滬兜銷，則原料價格，可上下其手，故松香廠商，寧願缺乏原料時停工，不願向產地收購，原因即在乎此，目前滬地經營松香精製廠，其經營方法，頗為靈活，一面以山客之生貨，拋售於用戶，以用戶貨款，付諸山客，一轉手間，就有厚利可圖，又何必往山地搜購。</p>
<p>滬地目前生松香價每担為一萬八九，精製松香每担为一萬八九，精製松香每担價為三萬五六，（美貨N松香每担價為九萬五與自製松香較每担價祗百分之六十）如果以山農的成本與廠商的利潤作一對此，可得如下之結果：</p>
<p>（一）山農成本：每日採收松香一担，工資三千元，挑送及山租三千五百元，產地收購價每担自八千至一萬元，山農剛　到工資成本。</p>
<p>（二）由產地運至上海，每担運費最高一萬五，最低一萬元，運銷商人：損失每担自一萬五至五千元。</p>
<p>（三）製造廠商，原料購進價，每担二萬，出松節油三磅至五磅，每磅三千元，精製松香九十斤，價值三萬一千五，除工資利息開支外，可得毛利一倍至一倍餘。</p>
<p>依此而論，山農僅僅賺了工錢，把松香一文不名送給了人，運銷商人倒了楣，把血本虧了去，廠商似乎坐收其利了，但也並不，第一：現在一家小得可憐的松香製造廠，其房屋等不算，光是設備費，也得花去千把萬，加上房屋頂費等，至少就費一筆大資金，倘然依暗息來算，吃本也極可觀了！第二：松香生意，是一年祗有六個月，其餘六個月是坐食其利的。</p>
<p>我國松香，產量旣如此之大，工業用途又如此之微，事實上唯一辦法，祗有提高品質，大量出口之一法。</p>
<p>生產建設　特輯</p>
<h3>各省應速成立昆蟲局</h3>
<p>— 周堯</p>
<p>八年來艱苦抗戰，業已結束，瘡痍滿目，百政待舉，今後工作，自以復員建設為第一，智者見智，仁者見仁，朝野人士，討論頗多，鄙農業復員當務之急，茲述其理由，就正明達。</p>
<p>（一）收復匪為敵人蹂躪多年，壓榨掠奪，農村如洗生產低落，庫藏空虛；而後方各省，亦以年來受水旱蟲災影響，秋收歉薄，存積無多。我國米麥，平時尚不足二千餘萬担，戰後糧荒，尤為嚴重，（報載各地餓殍遍野，聞之驚心。）採辦外糧，蓋以救急，實為我農業古國之大恥，故必求根本解決，增加食糧生產，方足以塞漏滬，而固國本。而防除害蟲，減少損失，實為最迅速有效之根本辦法，所謂（七分是蟲，三分是種）是也。</p>
<p>年來河南患蝗，害深勢烈，並蔓及陜西，猶未見悉，昔以地近火線，未能撲除，想遺卵極多，深為可慮。倘今年再度猖獗，勢必顆粒難收，鉅災一至，民不聊生，其他曾患蟲災之省　市，亦難免不有類乎此者。防患未然，事屬必要，昆蟲局之設立，實為迫切之至。</p>
<p>（二）我國農民飲食，以榖類為多，蔬菜水菓極少。惟以榖類中缺少健康必須之鐵質與維他命，故身體嬴弱，發育不良，昔在戰時，人民營養尤多。今後必須提高國民營養，及生活水準，除主要榖食外，須增加蔬菜水菓等副食品，但蔬菜水菓等園藝植物，受昆蟲之損害極鉅，故防除害蟲，為增產之第一要務。</p>
<p>（三）棉為農業之大宗，吾國亦未能自足自給，戰前每年輸入在一千萬担以上，而受蟲害損失年約九百四十萬担，以農立國之國家，衣服所需，尚須取給他國，實為羞恥，且棉花為火藥之原料，關係國防，尤為深切。戰爭之勝負，決於平時之準備，故世界各國，除整軍經武，磨礪以須外，於物資之籌備，莫不盡力為之，今後我國當如何注意棉作害蟲之防除，以謀棉作之增產耶？</p>
<p>（四）蠶絲茶葉桐油，為我國歷年之大宗出品，抵回外匯為數甚巨。建國伊始，人口物資，多於往昔，出口物品，必宜倍　，始足相抵，故絲茶桐油，急須增產。政府最近亦已注意及此，乃有中國蠶絲公司之設立，用意深善，無待論矣。惟其實施方案，尚未之聞，但如何減輕生絲茶桐油生產之成本，實為重大之問題，欲謀解決，自非改良生產技術，及防除蟲害不為功。</p>
<p>（五）大戰以後，必有瘟疫，考之古今中外史乘，莫不皆然，蓋以戰爭殺傷，暴骨殺塲，同胞之死傷於前方與後方者，達二千萬元，敵人之死於我國疆土者，又數百萬人，血腥遍野，肢腸滿地，疫癘之來襲，可以預料，而其傳染，則十九由於昆蟲為之媒介，故撲殺蚊蠅蚤蟲，以杜疫癘之傳播，實有亟切之必要。</p>
<p>（六）復員以後之交通，以飛機為尚，千里如咫尺，轉瞬即至。外國或外省植物苗木種子之輸入極便，同時外國或外省之害蟲帶入之機會亦多。害蟲在其原產地，因有天敵之控制，為害不顯，一至新環境，如無天敵之控制，則必釀成極大之災害，故全國各地關隘，必須設有專人，以司檢騐，並謀應付之方策。</p>
<p>（七）裁軍以後，移軍屯墾，勢所必然，但荒地雜草叢生，昆蟲蕃息，一旦刈除，昆蟲將迫於饑餓。加害墾區之作物，因「天然平衡」之破壞，而害蟲問題隨之發生，故邊省蟲害問題，應與墾荒並重。</p>
<p>（八）我國過去，剎蟲藥劑，殺蟲器械，十九購自外國，亦為漏巵之一。其實全國各地，不少殺早植物，及土產殺蟲方法，均頗有效，然皆亟須專人作科學之實騐與研究，改良而推廣之，至少用以控制害蟲之各種益蟲。亦有待研究與利用。年來外國殺蟲新劑，日新月異，如DDT等，吾人尤須加緊研究，亟起直追。</p>
<p>綜上所述，戰後復員各項重要措施，糧食，副食，衣被原料之增產，外匯之挽回，以及人民之生命保障，與其健康之促進，國際學術地位之提高，均有關昆蟲學之研究，與夫昆蟲局之設立，幸各省行政公局，及經紳名流，注意及此，並從速成立昆蟲局，以為庶民謀福利。</p>
<h3>標準化之意義</h3>
<p>— 楊楊</p>
<p>這次戰爭能夠順利結束，有人歸功於美國的大量物質，確能担負起「世界大兵工廠」的聲譽而不愧，假如我們研究珍珠港事變前美國的生產尚趕不上日本，幾年後，就能担負起「世界大兵工廠」的重責，筒中原因，嚴格說，我們應該歸功美國平時標準化運動的推行，當然我們也不能抹殺其他一切因素，如高度的技術，富蹠的原料，以及充足的設備，但是我們認為標準化是基本的也是主要的因素。</p>
<p>中國標準化運動卅二年經濟部在重慶曾於所屬各廠礦產品展覽會時，趁便宜宣傳一次，當時並未得到任何顯著的響應，現在似乎更成「明日黃花」之感了。</p>
<p>現在中國普遍都在談工業化，若是我們對美國的生產以及蘇聯一，二，三屆的五年計劃（現在蘇聯又在推動第四屆五年計劃了）加以適當注意，我們談標準化不是無意義的。</p>
<p>標準化乃是採取或建立規則或示範減少事物的動作，也即是說規定標準增加產量減少生產費為主要方法。</p>
<p>普通標準化可分為（一）產物標準化（二）原料標準化（三）工具標準化（三）勞工標準化（五）動作標準化（六）程序標準化。一般專工製造即是產物標準化。所謂原料標準化也非必須使用最優良之原料，乃合乎特種目的之特定品質原料，一經選定，就定為標準，工作標準化乃勞工管理，製造管理之中心。基本方法有二：即是我們熱識的時間考察，與動作考察，但是提到時間考察與動作考察常遭工人反對。我們可以仿效蘇聯第一，二屆五年計劃推行的，斯丹哈諾夫的自覺，自動地担任起本身任務，因為中國還談不上勞資對立，充其量也不過一些少數不法官吏以及奸商不正當畸形的財富　，同時中國工業尚屬　芽，需要加倍培養，假如能促使工人認清這些，我相信可以合作的。</p>
<p>規定標準通常可以採取下列三步驟：首先研究各種方法及施行的效果（考察）然後化驚為簡，擇取各種方法或示樣最良者，（簡單化）最後規定最良方法永久仿行（標準化）。</p>
<p>一般反對標準化的認為，（一）促進工人機械化（二）毀滅製造秘密（三）阻止工業進步（四）摧殘個性與發明興趣，根據美國今日生產界的事實後三者反對的理由是不能成立的。但這也是　　　，並非絕無補救的方法，同時衡量標準化的貢獻一方面，孰利孰弊，我們是不難分辨的。標準化貢獻於生產方面可以（一）便利大量生產（二）增大生產力（三）減低生產費（四）增進品質加多改良的機會，對於社會方面：（一）減低生產成本，因而消費者生活費用減低，生活程度提高，（二）減少失業，增高工資免除工業界不安與衝突，同時減少營業變動，使經濟均衡發展。</p>
<h3>救救可憐的茶農</h3>
<p>— 沈志剛</p>
<p>茶葉，本是我國特產之一，漢唐以後，即有對外之貿易，且與邊疆各發生易馬的交易，在軍事和政治上，具有莫大的價值，據一八七二年海關統計報告，輸出量達二百萬担以上，合關銀四四·七九五·一六六兩，幾獨佔世界所有的茶葉市塲，一九二〇年以後，竟減落至四十萬担，國茶外銷的慘況，可謂極點。</p>
<p>抗戰軍興，財政部於二十七年六月七日頒布第一次戰時產業統制，藉以發展對外貿易，市塲集中香港，故在二十七八兩年中，不但出口數額超出往年甚多，茶葉市價大見增加，茶農生活較為好轉，二十九年後海口封鎖，茶農生活，困苦不堪。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，眾望國茶出口，將大發展，茶樓紛紛歸鄉，整理茶園，茶商亦相繼準備，以備外銷。</p>
<p>今日茶汎已屆，而茶葉市價，每況愈下，據四月二日華盛頓物價寓情于景局公佈，祁門紅茶每磅不得超過四角二分，綠茶不得超過四角八分，折合國幣，每担最高高價，僅在九萬元左右，且須在紐約交貨。</p>
<p>然而我們茶農的成本究竟要多少呢？以下請看看平水茶區的毛茶成本：</p>
<p>附表</p>
<p>成本項目　金額　說明</p>
<p>採摘工資　二〇、〇〇〇　每担毛茶需青葉四百斤每斤採工五十元合計</p>
<p>如上數</p>
<p>初製工資　七、五〇〇　每担毛茶需工五人每工以一·五〇〇元計算</p>
<p>柴炭費　二、四〇〇　每担毛茶需柴炭四〇〇斤每担以六〇〇元算</p>
<p>膳食費　一八、〇〇〇　每担毛茶需採製工三〇人每人以六〇〇元算</p>
<p>油燈費　一、二〇〇　每担毛茶需青油二斤每以六〇〇元算</p>
<p>雜工費　一、二〇〇　每担毛茶自產地至茶廳及其他什工合計一工</p>
<p>管理費　一二、〇〇〇　平均每兩畝產製毛茶一担共需中耕除草十工</p>
<p>每工以一·二〇〇元合算</p>
<p>地租費　一二、〇〇〇　一般茶農均為佃戶採製一担毛茶以一·五給地主</p>
<p>工具費　八〇、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>加上茶廠的集中，精製，包裝，運輸，損失等費用，每担至少成本在十萬元以上。如此出口貿易，怎樣有發展的可能？</p>
<p>為取包匯，以購買建國物資，實為今後迫不容緩的政策，但是現在的事實是怎樣呢？進口多，出口少，可憐的茶農，末日又將光臨，賢明的當局們，急應想一個挽救的辦法，以發展對上的貿易，否則明年的今日，恐怕茶農茶商，從此絕跡，「茶為我國固有這特產」，或將成為歷史上的名字了。</p>

<p>老廠的情形：有許多很興盛的工廠，仔細考查起來，他們似乎並沒有經過詳細的考慮，這些廠房往往是一二個人或甚至於一個人開始在他的家的附近設立一個小廠，那開始的時候的規模是非常小的，但經過努力的經營，牠的範圍，一點點地擴大起來，主持人除了日常生活所需的費用之外，就把歷年賺得的錢放在事業裏，廠房也逐漸增添起來，但是因為要合乎經濟之道，所以對於廠房的建築，都要採用代價較低的方法或材料，當他們的事業迅速發展的時候，他們可以建造新的廠房，但有時候因為舊廠房是發祥之地，不願意把牠拆除，於是就設法保存起來，而這些隨時增加的廠房，因為建造年代不一，建造方式不一，往往不能互相連貫，對於事務的進行上，很不方便，如果是設計建造完全新式的廠房，那末有許多地方是應該革除的，但要保守固有的廠房，就不能不將就一點，所以利用舊廠房的惟一缺點，就是事務的進行不甚方便，要實施科學管理，也就要發生困難。</p>
<p>新的廠房：一個能夠創設一家完全新造的廠房的人，是比較地幸運的，因為他可以不受習俗的限制，可以完全按照着當時的需要一切從事設計，但是他必須格外留意地從事工作，因為沒有老廠做參考，完全是屬於創造的。</p>
<p>建造廠屋選擇地點時必須考慮到的幾個問題</p>
<p>（一）原料與銷行之間的距離：一個製造廠的廠房的所在地，最好能夠使由原料起至運輸的距離愈短愈好，譬如說，一個廠房設立在近鐵道或水道，使運輸非常便利，那末對於銷行是有無上便利的。</p>
<p>又如一家罐頭食品廠，為求製造便利起見，廠房的地段，最好是接近蔬菜，雞鴨，鮮菓等原料的生產地。但不必接近鐵罐的製造廠，因為一個鐵罐製造廠，往往要供給許多罐頭食物廠，而且鐵罐的運輸比較便利，不像蔬菜，鮮菓，雞鴨，魚，肉等麻煩，因為廠房的地段適宜，不但採辦原料較為便利，一年中所節省的金錢，也就非常可觀了。</p>
<p>所以最合乎理想的是一個廠房的地段，離原料很近，離運輸的地方也很近。</p>
<p>（二）對於勞工問題的考慮：成立一個製造廠，當然不能缺少勞工。勞工是製造廠的生產者，因此在建立一個廠房的時候，對於勞工的來源也是值得考慮的，如果是一個極大規模的製造廠，那末這個問題比較地容易解決，因為可以自己建造起一個市鎮來，使本廠的工人住在裏面，同時，還可以舉辦許多工人的福利事業，這種辦法，在國外很多，但在中國很少，從前康元製罐廠是供給工人住宿的，照着科學管理的原則辦理，很有成效。</p>
<p>如果是一個規模不十分大的製造廠，那末在選舉地段的時候，關於勞工的來源，是值得考慮的。</p>

<h3>旅滇工業鉅子臨去秋波　建議雲南工業化</h3>
<p>— 特派員張生力</p>
<p>本報五月廿二日昆明航訊</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後復員的熱潮，帶走了雲南的財富，也帶走了雲南的智　。在抗戰期中，雲南不特是全國財富的集中地，而目是人材集中地之大量的財富，使雲南日趨繁榮，大批的人材，使雲南樹立了現在工業建設的初基。爲時雖僅八載，收效則極為顯著，一般人常爲雲南慶幸。但從開始復員到今火，八個月的復員工作，打垮了八年中艱辛締造的成果，不特雲南人引以爲痛，許多參加建設雲南的園了，亦因此而深爲婉惜。</p>
<h3>人才流徙　游資逃逸</h3>
<p>抗戰勝利後，旅滇的外省人相繼還鄉，一部份資金自然隨之而轉移，此事不可非議。但在最近數月中，本省工商界人士的游資、亦紛紛調到京滬各地，以　厚利。影響一所及，市面銀根日緊，工商業一愈不景氣，投機的魔手，控制了半個市場，失望，待等的心理，充滿了整個工業界。這是當前各項建設中最大危機之一</p>
<p>抗戰勝利之初，投機商人手中的黃金，外幣，紗布等，在價値上雖然打了幾分折扣，最少有一部份人，在當時仍然堪稱「富有銅山」，彼等竟至通過民意與與論的關係，大聲疾呼，天天求救。觀其情勢，似如涸魚，不可終日，而當時注意到全滇工擴業的危機者，除工業協會滇省分會外，一般人鮮有　　相關的感覺。該會雖曾一再請求救濟各廠礦，所獲貸款仍極微。一個最簡單的原因，就是投機的人多，求救的呼聲，比較　亮有力。全省在工礦業中實幹的人少，而且缺乏信心與毅力，故常存亡關頭，益感束手無策。</p>
<p>雲南的省營工礦業，原有兩個最人的系統，一爲雲南企業局，一爲雲南經濟委員會，論其財富，堪稱甲於任何一省。論其組織，亦極龐大，論其基礎，均已相等機回。而自抗戰勝利後，所屬名單位，或已相繼停閉，或餘一息尙存，揆其原因，多由於人截之不减。近半年中，這一兩單位正在進行改祖，合併成立雲南人民企業公司，希望使之一元化，地方化。在公私分明的原則下，使財富獲以維持與發展，法良意美，但亦因人事關係，迄今仍吿難產。</p>
<p>抗戰期中，在滇的國營工礦業，曾極一時之盛。資委會所屬各廠礦，即達十餘單位，其中如中央機器廠，中央電工器材廠，中央無綫電廠等，規模均甚宏大。一般投機的巨富，如能儘量轉移其資財，本着少問收穫的決心，發展全省大小工礦業，實乃千載一時的良機。本省一部份深謀遠慮之士，在過去八年中，雖曾爲此事而一再呼籲，但其收效不著。抗戰勝利後，國營各廠礦，或因復員而結束，或因無法維持而緊縮，迄今所存無幾。這對於本省今後的工業建設，失去了一個最大的助力。</p>
<p>抗戰期中，全國各地工業人才，集中本省者甚多，抗戰勝利後，因復員與接收工作，急待展開，至使彼等相縱離滇。這在本省工業建設的智　上，也是一大損失。固然本省工業界中，不乏卓越之士，但欲以之從事大規模的建設，甚至維特戰時的一點基礎，深感人才不够。</p>
<h3>工業鉅子　進行規劃</h3>
<p>人才的分散，資金的逃逸，省營民營工礦業的停頓，與國營工礦業的遷移，這些事實，一方面加重了復興雲南工礦業的困難，一方面又感到復興工作的刻不容緩。記者曾爲此事而走訪本省工業界鉅子，收集有關資料，探詢其卓見，爲時逾二月，始獲悉一部份其體而徵的初步建議。但在各省工業建設中，現已進行此項規劃工作者，尙不可多得。</p>
<p>全國工業協會南分會，曾於三月前組織「雲南工業復興計劃委員會」，互推周仁爲主委，方剛副之。委員爲林鳳岐，郭珠，桂迺黃、朱健飛，連忠靜等。該會從集體討論，徵求意見，搜集材料，到草　計劃，歷時二月餘，始完成「雲南工業化　議」一文。現定於本月內華奉中央各有蘭部院，及本省各有關　處，請其採納實施。這七位草擬計劃甚者，都是省外人士，在抗戰期中，對雲南的工礦建，確有幾許貢戲。彼等深知雲南的經濟環境與資源，認淸了雲南工業化的可能性和必要性，而且目覩了雲南工礦業的發展過程，從萌芽到成長，到衰退，欣慰與共，焦慮亦隨之。他們愛雲南，更愛與滇人共同手創的成果。當前的復錢工作，正待積極展開，彼等於離滇前，念念不忘雲南的工業化，故有上述計劃的擬訂，或請此乃臨去秋波，或謂此乃心力表現，但在今日的大後方，如此秋波，又有幾個？</p>
<p>談到雲南的天然環境經濟資源，在全國各省中實屬罕有，全滇土地空曠，氣候溫　，林畜茂盛，鑛藏豐富，經濟條件，堪稱得天獨厚。若能人盡其力，財盡其用，地盡其利，數十年後，足可與束北媲美。况値目前關外風雲未定，中原瘡瘧滿目，沿江沿海一帶，或已元氣大喪，或餘劫後殘灰，拯鐵救難之不暇遑論大規模的工業建設。而　省工礦的開發，不特困難較少，且在未來的國防上，更不能稍予忽視，故整個建國程序中，應將雲南的工業建設爲一個主要的和急待進行的一環。</p>
<p>關於雲南工業化的步驟，根據周仁，方剛，林鳳岐，朱健飛，郭珠，桂迺黃，連忠靜諸氏的建議，計分下列四項：</p>
<h3>交通建設　陸空並進</h3>
<p>（一）航空建設：在鐵路未能完成利用之前，儘量利用現有的飛機塲，並於重要地區，增築有進濟價値的機塲，使省內空運遍及各區，籍以取給重要物資及建設器村。</p>
<p>（二）鐵路建設：應以輔助鋼鐵事業之發展為目標，第一步以安寗爲中心，建設昆明至一平浪幹路約一二〇公里，一平浪煤礦支路約二〇公路，祿諘至大山崖鐵礦支路約一五公里，草舖至安寗王家塘鐵礦支路約〇公里，可保村煤礦支路約二五公里。第二步敷設重要幹路及補充煤錢礦山支路，完成叙昆鐵路約七〇〇公里，石佛鐵路約四〇〇公里，易門鐵礦支路約四〇公里，會澤銅礦支路約一〇〇公里。第三步敷設其他重要幹路及重要礦區支路，計有滇緬，滇康，滇黔，滇，桂四路，及沿幹路一帶之重要礦山支路。</p>
<h3>鋼鐵建設　分期完成</h3>
<p>鐵路建設第一步建造幹路約一〇〇公里，支路九〇公里，除八五〇〇鋼軌，約需八五〇〇噸，須向外洋訂購外，其餘三五磅輕軌，約三二〇〇噸，幹部鋼枕，魚尾板，扣鐵等項，約需八〇〇〇噸，均可自製。第二步幹路一、一〇〇公里，支路一四〇公里，需鋼軌十萬噸，附屬鋼材九萬噸，連同運轉設備及其各工業所需鋼鐵五萬噸，約共需鋼鐵二五萬噸。首先以年產五千噸開始，逐漸擴充至年產七萬噸，期於五年內完成。再以五年完成第三步的鐵路建設，爲應上項需要，鋼鐵方面，應先將現有的鋼鐵廠，機器　，整理集中，統一組織，使能及早開始生產。並需添建一五〇噸化鐵爐兩座，十噸傳　麥煉鋼　五座，三噸電爐二座，六噸電爐兩座，一噸高頻率電爐一座。擴充煤鐵礦採礦設備。建設副產物煉焦廠，耐火材料廠，鐵滓水泥廠，大型軋鋼軌廠，練鋼　　廠，鋼板鋼管廠，鐵　　輛廠。</p>
<h3>電力建設　設廠工作</h3>
<p>滇省各大河流水勢湍急，可以開發水力電之處，隨池皆有，爲配合甲乙兩項建設及供應可能儘先發展之工業起見，電力建設的先後如次：（一）螂川水力電廠：該河長約九四公里，水面落差共二二〇公尺，蘊蓄之水力達三一七〇〇馬力。如利用滇池爲調節水庫，則其蘊蓄水力可增至一三六五〇〇馬力。除大為莊一段，已有耀龍公司利用其一部份外，下游蔡家村石樓梯一段，在五公里內有落差七〇公尺。滇池一經整理調節，該段總發電量可得三萬瓩，故可分三部份開發之。第一廠設於蔡家村，發電六千瓩。第二廠設於石樓梯，發電二萬瓩。第三廠設於石樓梯下游二公里，發電四千瓩。以上發電量，二萬瓩供鋼鐵事業之用，一萬瓩供其他工業之需。（二）巴盤江大跌水：該處有九〇公尺的大瀑布，自大跌水至小跌水之一公里內，有落差一二〇公尺，可發電八千瓩，工程極簡易。若與昆明各廠組成一電氣綱，除可供路南，宣良，澂江一帶之用電外，並可補助昆明各工業之用。（三）昭通晒雨河：在一二〇公里內，有落差一三〇〇公尺，其中水岩一段，在四〇〇公里內有落差約四〇〇公尺。發電量共約三萬瓩，若於上游建蓄水庫，可能增至六萬瓩。該處電力可輸至昭通，威寗，會澤等地，而該區爲煤，鐵，銅，鉛，鋅，蘊藏豐富之區，賴茲電力並配合叙昆織路的運輸，則其經濟價値甚大。（二）西洱水力：由下關黑龍橋西流不及一里處，永流湍急，估計可發電二萬瓩。除可供風儀賓川，洱源，鄧川，大理各縣農田灌之用外，並可建設迤西的工定重心。</p>
<h3>其他工業　八個部門</h3>
<p>（一）機器工業：配合本省鋼鐵及廉價水力電，必可使大小機器工業獲得合理的發展。（二）肥料及火柴原料工業：本省特產磷礦，品質之佳，蘊藏之富，爲國內所罕見，當可大量開發製造，以供國內肥田及火柴原料之用。（三）煉鋁工業：昆明，安寗一帶，盛產鋁礦，配以水力電，當爲極有希望的工業。（四）玻璃工業：昆明附近，產有極佳的玻璃原料，當可大規模的生產。（五）紡織工業：本省迤南的木棉，品質旣優，推廣至易。全省棉區分佈於八十餘縣，倘能積極推廣，防治蟲害，不難自給自足。（六）化工事業。本省盛產銷磺原料，可供酸鹼工業的發展。（七）造紙工業：本省原始森林頗多，一日交通便利，則其木漿原料，取之不盡，用之不竭。（八）各種礦業：筒舊蒙自一帶的錫舞，爲全國第一產區。銅鑛分佈甚廣，曾經產銅之區計有八十餘縣。銀鉛鋅鐵分佈六十餘縣，希望之大，可冠全國。煤鐵礦原料，本省得天獨厚，儲量雖微遜於東北，而品質堪稱上品，足可供應西南各省之需。金鑛之重要產地，在金沙江，瀾滄江，紅河，怒江各流域，均可大量開採，至於武定的石綿。麗江的雲母，均爲本省的重要特產。</p>
<h3>五項方案　促其實現</h3>
<p>雲南工業化的步驟，旣如上述，如何促其實現，下面有五個方榮：</p>
<p>（一）由政府與人民，共同組織計劃硏究委員會，期於短期內制定工業化大綱，再分別緩急，草擬具體實施辦法，次第推行。</p>
<p>（二）凡有國營必要的事業，擬請政府迅速舉辦。其可以民營，或應歸民營者，由政府切實獎勵，並竭力保障之。</p>
<p>（三）由政府發展交通事業經費中，指撥一部份款項，以定貨方式，維持現有各工廠的工作。</p>
<p>（四）實施一計劃資金，由政府用籌撥，補助，貸予，或發行債票各種方式，積極分別籌措，傳早得成數。</p>
<p>（五）政府在稅收土，特將凡　於工業化方案中辦理的各民營廠礦之器材進口稅，營業稅，所利得稅等，分別予以减免，以示倡導，庶可使社會游資，走土工業的途徑。</p>
<h3>讀者意見　規約</h3>
<p>（一）本欄絕對公開，文責自負，但切忌，長。（二）切勿攻訐私人，切勿一稿兩投。（三）投稿人須寫明讀者意見稿件、並須舉示眞實姓名及地址，但發表時得用筆名。（四）本欄稿件槪不致　。（五）對來稿本報有删節之權。（六）來稿披露與否，槪不函復。（七）本報於必要時，得將來稿轉致有關機關參考。</p>
<h3>關於留學考試的疑問</h3>
<p>編輯先生：値茲領袖昭示建國伊始，亟需培養人才之際，聆悉吾敎育行政當局，以聖約翰大學尙未立案，不准吾畢業同學，報名參加即將舉行之自費留學考試，不勝駭異。爲特懇假貴報一角，　述墩點疑問於下，願吾敎育當局有以解釋之？（一）吾約翰畢業同學，爲政府行政官吏，數不在少，可知政府事實上已承認其學籍，何敎部反不承認？“敎部旣不承認其學籍，則為甚不勒令停辦，而仍容許其開學，致無辜學生受累乎？（二）數月前，財部舉行高級財務人員試，吾約翰同學亦准參加，大部錄取，現今服務於各稅局，是財部已承認其學籍，何敎部則否？（三）使敎部欲借此而令聖約翰立案，則敎部自可直接命令學校當局遵辦，初不必犧牲吾輩無辜學子，何况吾校現正進行立案手續，爲愛惜靑年計，論理亦應予以通融。（四）且今敎部旣採自費留學管理制度，旨在選拔眞才，而淘汰不合格者，則儘可許其參加考試，優勝劣敗，憑其成績可也。抑尤有進者，國家爲選拔眞才計，尙爲一般無文憑而有志服公務者，特設檢定考試之制度，况吾同學究有文　證明其資格者乎？光培講上。六·三·</p>

<h3>Zhou Enlai Flew Back to Beijing Last Night; Rumors of New Demands from Yan'an; Date for the Military Three-Person Committee Meeting to be Decided Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, along with Li Minran and three aides, returned to Nanjing by Marshall's special plane at 6:10 PM on the 9th. Lu Dingyi did not return, and Mao Zedong did not come. Communist Party representatives stationed in Nanjing, Dong Biwu, Deng Yingchao, Li Weihan, and others, went to the airport to welcome them. After disembarking, Zhou went directly to his private residence in Meiyuan New Village. After a brief rest, he went to the CCP office to discuss the results of his return to Yan'an for instructions with Dong, Li, and others. It is said that Zhou spent about 43 hours in Yan'an. Apart from less than 11 hours of sleep for two nights, he spent the remaining 32 hours mostly on laborious reports, lengthy talks, and various tense meetings. Therefore, although Zhou's appearance was the same as usual after returning to Beijing, he seemed extremely fatigued. It is reported that Zhou will present the results of his return to Yan'an for instructions to Marshall on the 10th and exchange views with Marshall on the major preconditions for the Military Three-Person Committee meeting. According to well-informed sources, the Yan'an side has, based on Zhou's suggestions, put forward specific new demands. Among the conditions, the demands for the Northeast, in addition to hoping to revise the "5-to-1" ratio of the troop reorganization plan, also include political and economic demands. The date for the Military Three-Person Committee meeting is rumored to be decided on the morning of the 10th. If circumstances permit, this meeting can be held at any time.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] A responsible person from a relevant intelligence agency stated: The CCP's demands regarding the government reorganization issue are to increase the number of State Council members from eight to ten. As for the allocation of ministerial positions in the Executive Yuan, the CCP is requesting the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Ministry of Interior. In addition, they are requesting the governorships of the four provinces in North China: Hebei, Shandong, Rehe, and Chahar, with an attached note stating that if there are problems with Rehe Province, the eastern provinces can be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The day after the ceasefire order was issued, the Communist troops in the Northeast attacked the National Army, and at the same time, the Communist troops in North China suddenly launched an offensive. When this unfortunate news reached the capital, all those concerned about peace were shocked. However, the government's attitude was extremely calm. Since today is a Sunday, official personnel are remaining silent. The so-called "third party" hoping for an extension of the ceasefire period felt particularly impacted after hearing this bad news.</p>
<h3>Northeast Communist Troops Disobey Ceasefire Order, Attacking National Army on Four Fronts; Rehe Communist Troops also Advancing Along the Railway</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 9th, 8:00 PM] (1) The Communist troops besieging Lafa Station and the Old Station continued to increase last night, totaling twelve regiments including the First Division, Second Division, Independent Brigade, and Second Garrison Brigade, with eight mountain guns and twelve mortars. By noon on the 9th, they were fiercely attacking the National Army. All houses and bunkers near the Old Station were destroyed. More than 200 National Army officers and soldiers were killed or wounded on the night of the 7th. (2) The Communist troops near Taolaizhao continued to increase, seemingly planning to besiege the National Army stationed there. (3) Last night, near Yingchengzi and Qianhou Mayantun, southeast of Haicheng, the Communist troops launched a night attack on the National Army from a certain high ground and the Sharui River, but were repelled. As of the time of the dispatch, the Communist troops were still attacking the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th] Since the ceasefire order was issued, the National Army has obeyed the order to cease pursuit. However, starting at 3:00 PM on the 7th, the Communist troops launched attacks on our defending troops on four fronts: (1) About 700-800 Communist troops near Halahai attacked our defending troops starting at 3:00 PM on the 7th, resulting in over 40 casualties. (2) The 62nd Regiment of the 21st Brigade of the Communist troops near Taolaizhao attacked our defending troops starting at 3:00 PM on the 7th. At 9:00 PM at night, they increased their forces by another 700-800 men and expanded their fierce attack on our defending troops. (3) At 4:00 PM on the 7th, 500-600 Communist troops launched a fierce attack on our defending troops at Wukeshu from the Yushu County area, and three of our soldiers were captured. (4) At 3:00 PM on the 7th, the Second Garrison Brigade and the First Division of the Communist troops launched a large-scale attack on our defending troops at Lafa, resulting in fierce fighting. The Communist troops in the above four locations violated the ceasefire order. The National Army, for the sake of self-defense, repelled them. However, south of Lafa Station, Communist troops from Jiaohe transported troops northward by train for reinforcement, and the defending troops are closely guarding against this.</p>
<p>[United Press, Changchun, 8th] A spokesman for the forward headquarters of the National Army here stated at a special press conference this evening: Three hours after the ceasefire order took effect yesterday afternoon, the Communist troops violated the agreement and launched attacks on four strongholds of the National Army. The attacked strongholds are stepping stones for the National Army's advance towards Harbin: (1) Taolaizhao, on the Changchun-Harbin Railway line, seven miles north of the Songhua River, (2) Halahai, forty miles west of Taolaizhao, (3) Wukeshu, thirty-five miles east of Taolaizhao, (4) Lafa, a railway junction 160 miles east of Changchun. The offensives against Lafa and Taolaizhao are major battles and are still ongoing. The Communist troops attacking Taolaizhao were reinforced by more than 700 men before 9:00 PM last night. The spokesman emphasized that before receiving orders from Chairman Chiang, the National Army will continue to abide by the ceasefire agreement and will not launch attacks, advances, or pursuits, but will defend their strongholds. Brigadier General Baird, a senior American official of the Executive Headquarters now in Changchun, has been informed of this news, and it is hoped that he can send officials from Changchun to investigate. The representatives of both the Nationalists and the Communists on the forward executive team of the Executive Headquarters have not yet arrived in Changchun. At the same time, Nationalist personnel in Beiping today accused the Communist troops in Rehe of again attacking Chaoyang and the Pingquan Railway. The Propaganda Department's office in Beiping stated: Gong Xin (transliteration), the commander of the Communist troops in the Rehe area, is directing more than 10,000 Communist troops to prepare to attack Lingyuan, located between Chaoyang and Chengde. 15,000 Communist troops are concentrated near Jianping, sixty-five miles north of Lingyuan, preparing to attack Chaoyang.</p>
<h3>Artificial Housing Shortage</h3>
<p>Local Authorities Study Allocation</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] In order to solve the housing shortage problem in the capital, the authorities conducted a city-wide survey of vacant houses, which has now been completed. According to statistics, in the Eastern District alone, there are 1,340 vacant houses that are unoccupied. The situation in other districts can be imagined. From this, it can be seen that the artificial factors are the main cause of the housing shortage in Nanjing. The authorities are currently studying allocation and contract-making methods.</p>
<h3>Mourning Deceased Friends and Handling Private Affairs; Shao Lizi Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing; Holds Relatively Optimistic View of the Current Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Shao Lizi, Secretary of the Political Consultative Council, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning with his wife, Fu Xuewen. This trip is to mourn deceased friends and handle private affairs. It is claimed that if the ceasefire negotiations between the Nationalists and the Communists can achieve a comprehensive solution, the National Assembly may be held on October 10th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, City Dispatch] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Consultative Council, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. In the morning, he went to the Jade Buddha Temple to mourn the death of the late Council member Ye Chucang. In the afternoon, he attended the memorial service for Zhu Shaoping, the late Consul-General of the Philippines. This trip has no other tasks, and he will return to Nanjing by express train tonight. He met with reporters at his private residence yesterday and discussed the current situation. He said: "I believe that we should not be overly optimistic, but pessimism is also useless. We should adopt a relatively optimistic attitude, because our country is now moving towards the path of peace and unification. Even if there are difficulties, we should do our best to overcome them." When reporters asked Shao whether the Comprehensive Group of the Political Consultative Conference would resume discussions after the ceasefire order was issued on the 15th, Shao said, "I believe that the Military Three-Person Committee will first resume immediately. As for political talks, the government is currently exchanging views with all parties at any time. After the representatives of the Youth Party and the Democratic League arrive in Beijing, we have maintained contact with them throughout." Reporters also asked Shao about the content of past exchanges of views with various parties. He said: "All negotiation principles are included in the ceasefire order." Shao finally stated that all parties must work hard for the future development of the overall situation. Since Chairman Chiang returned from the Northeast, he and Special Envoy Marshall have held earnest discussions on avoiding military conflict. As for the ceasefire talks on the 15th, some people in society still think that the time is short, but in my opinion, it is more than sufficient.</p>
<h3>Wang Lingji's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Our reporter interviewed Wang Lingji, Chairman of Jiangxi Province, on the 9th to inquire about the suicide of Cheng Mao's type, Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Field Grain Office, and the situation of grain administration. According to reports, Cheng was a loyal and responsible grain official who was conscientious in his work and cared about his reputation. He suffered from the fact that after the great war, the fields in Jiangxi were barren and agricultural production declined, making it difficult to collect grain. Although food was obtained with great difficulty, it could not be transported due to the lack of transportation tools, resulting in worry and indignation, leading to a passive suicide. Wang also stated that Jiangxi is a rice-producing area and can be self-sufficient, but continuous disasters have led to a shortage. In the future, a public cultivation method will be implemented on a township-guarantee basis to promote production and enrich the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Holds Meeting to Review Various Aspects of Transportation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] It was rumored here tonight that the Ministry of Communications and Commerce would convene a national transportation conference on a regular basis under the premise of restoring transportation. Our reporter then visited the Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Communications and learned that this was not the case. However, since the day before yesterday, the Ministry has begun a broad review meeting, divided into five departments: road administration, telecommunications administration, postal administration, highway administration, and maritime administration, to be held in stages and completed in about two weeks. Regarding the railway aspect, there are detailed plans for restoring transportation, but this information will only be compiled and announced after all of it has been completed. In addition, Minister Yu Dawei will separately ask the directors of each railway bureau to come to Beijing in the short term for inquiries and instructions.</p>
<h3>Jinan Central Bank Continues to Redeem Counterfeit Currency</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 8th] After the redemption of counterfeit United Reserve Bank notes ended at the end of May, there were still many banknotes remaining in the hands of the people. The Jinan Central Bank recently received orders to continue the redemption, which was implemented starting on the morning of the 8th and is scheduled to end at the end of June, with no further extensions.</p>
<h3>Grain Administration Talks Held in Various Counties in Southern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 9th] In order to ensure consistency in the implementation of grain administration, the counties of Southern Jiangsu held a grain administration discussion meeting in Suzhou yesterday. Tianliang material chiefs from Kunshan, Songjiang, Changshu, Wujiang, Jinshan, Qingpu, Taicang, Wuxian, and other counties attended. The main points of the resolutions were: (1) For the procurement of military rations, if wheat is converted to rice, it will be temporarily calculated at a ratio of two to one. (2) Losses in the transportation of military rations will be reimbursed at a rate of three to five catties per stone, and storage losses will be reimbursed according to the prescribed loss rate. (3) Rice for military rations will be directly extracted from each grain receiving warehouse, so as to avoid huge losses. (4) A request is made to the province to quickly levy deed tax.

<h3>UNRRA Relief Supplies Shipped to China; Our Country Requests Extension of Deadline; Far East Area Conference Next Held in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 9th] The Chinese representative to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Far East Committee has requested that the deadline for shipping UNRRA relief supplies to China be extended to beyond March 31 of next year. The reason given is that the transportation and distribution of relief supplies after they arrive in China are quite slow. At today's meeting, the committee decided to postpone a decision on whether to request UNRRA's approval of China's request until the next meeting on July 17. The committee also passed a resolution proposed by US representative Kilpatrick, advocating that UNRRA and the Chinese government agree on an agreement for the Chinese government to provide a sufficient amount of local currency to ensure that the relief distribution plan can be fully implemented. UNRRA Acting Director-General Rhee, speaking at the meeting about the release of information related to UNRRA's plan in China, said: UNRRA's shipments sometimes have to be kept secret, because speculators in the Chinese market have taken advantage of UNRRA's shipments to stir up trouble in the market.

<h3>Editorial: Save the Millions of Overseas Chinese in the East Indies!</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Indonesian independence movement, the situation in the Dutch East Indies has fallen into chaos. Although negotiations have been held between the two sides, the conflicts have not stopped and have even tended to escalate. "When the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer." How many of our overseas Chinese are there in the areas controlled by the authorities of the East Indies Republic! Looking out to the overseas territories, we are constantly anxious about the lives and property of our millions of overseas Chinese. The recent massacres of overseas Chinese are inhumane and cannot but make people feel grief-stricken!</p>
<p>According to foreign news agency reports: In Tanggerang City, west of Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, according to the agreement signed between the Netherlands and the East Indies Republic on May 28, it should have been occupied by the Dutch army. However, after the East Indies Independence Army withdrew, terrorists suddenly carried out a large-scale massacre in the area where overseas Chinese lived on June 5, which was appalling. According to initial estimates, as many as 600 overseas Chinese were killed, and 50 children were burned to death. According to the latest report, the situation has escalated, and the massacre has intensified. Nearly 3,000 overseas Chinese have been killed, and the fate of 25,000 people in the area is unknown. The overseas Chinese area has been almost completely destroyed, becoming a pile of ashes, and the East Indies people in Maok City have arrested all the overseas Chinese. However, the Dutch authorities are still sitting idly by. Although our government has made representations, there are still no effective measures to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese. After eight years of Chinese resistance, we are said to be one of the four or five powers after the victory, but our overseas Chinese have become lambs to be slaughtered. Anyone with blood would not be able to control their rage!</p>
<p>Since an appalling massacre has already occurred, what good is it to simply cry and feel heartbroken! The first step is to investigate the responsibility for the occurrence of this incident. In legal terms, according to the agreement of May 28, Tanggerang City was to be taken over by the Dutch army. Therefore, after the withdrawal of the East Indies Independence Army, the local order and security should be the responsibility of the Dutch government. In other words, the Dutch government has the responsibility to protect the safety of life and property of the overseas Chinese there. After the massacre, it should immediately take steps to rescue them, and cannot shirk responsibility simply because the murderers are East Indies terrorists. Our diplomatic authorities have made serious representations to the Dutch government, proposing four measures: punishing the murderers, providing compensation, reserving our right to claim damages, and that the Netherlands immediately take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. These can be said to be the minimum legitimate demands. But it must be understood that the crux of the current problem is not diplomatic negotiations, but what emergency measures to take to save the lives of these millions of overseas Chinese in danger, so as not to have the disaster of continued massacre. Regarding this point, we feel very sorry that the Allied authorities in the Dutch East Indies have turned a deaf ear to the suggestions and appeals of our Consul General Jiang Jialian in Batavia and have not adopted them.</p>
<p>Although the massacre of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies this time was carried out by irrational East Indies terrorists, it is difficult to deny that the rift between the overseas Chinese and the local ethnic groups will be deepened as a result. It is said that the East Indies Independence Army saw that some overseas Chinese were serving in the Dutch army, and mistakenly believed that the overseas Chinese had the fact of "helping the tyrant," so they used massacre to retaliate. In our view, this explanation must not be reasonable. For hundreds of years, our overseas Chinese and the indigenous ethnic groups have lived in peace. Even if they are usually squeezed out, they can endure it and are unwilling to argue. This time the massacre of overseas Chinese in the East Indies must have a different background! We have to tell the people of the East Indies: China has always sympathized with the Indonesian independence movement. When the United Nations Security Council discussed the Dutch East Indies issue in January of this year, our representative Gu Weijun expressed his support in principle for the proposal of the Ukrainian representative. Therefore, the people of the East Indies should recognize friends and enemies, and distinguish between right and wrong; otherwise, the authorities of the East Indies will not only arouse the resentment of our 450 million Chinese compatriots, but also lose international sympathy for their independence movement. Looking at the new situation in the post-war Pacific, why can't the authorities of the East Indies and the Dutch government negotiate a real result? You must recognize that in the future Pacific, besides China, which has never invaded, how many countries are there that truly sympathize with you and can truly help you to become independent?</p>
<p>In short, the occurrence of this unfortunate event at a time when our country is actively promoting the repatriation of overseas Chinese is enough to show that the status of our overseas Chinese after the war has not only no hope of improvement; but also that the crises they will encounter in the future are just beginning. For the sake of a permanent solution, our responsible authorities should find ways to obtain a good solution, so as to lay the foundation for the centuries-old plan for overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is painful enough to talk about! The overseas Chinese have not failed the motherland, but we have indeed failed the overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese have worked hard to pioneer the wilderness, but for hundreds of years, they have been oppressed and swallowed their tears. It was not easy for the motherland to fight a bloody war, and the overseas Chinese seemed to be able to hold their heads high in spirit. However, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the ravages of the Japanese invaders and the threats of the local authorities who colluded with the enemy, the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia suffered terribly. How could only the Dutch East Indies be like this? Unexpectedly, the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Allied countries won, and our tearful overseas Chinese still have to suffer even more serious massacres. Where does this start? In the past few months, overseas Chinese in Vietnam have been massacred and heavily taxed in the midst of French-Vietnamese conflicts, which everyone must still remember. Overseas Chinese in Singapore have also been massacred by British police, and remittances back home have been restricted. Several thousand overseas Chinese who have been "reported" and oppressed by the Japanese invaders for several years have no hope of survival. This spring, the natives of the Malay Peninsula also carried out large-scale massacres of overseas Chinese, insulting our country, killing our overseas Chinese leaders, and burning our houses. The bloodstains are still visible everywhere. In January and February of this year, anti-Chinese incidents also occurred in Thailand, and many overseas Chinese were killed. Even in Portuguese Timor, as recently as last winter, there were even strange events of overseas Chinese being arrested by the authorities for anti-Japanese demonstrations. In short, in various places in Southeast Asia after the victory, overseas Chinese are often massacred, and the loss of property and business is needless to say. We cannot help but wonder if the blood of our compatriots in this war has been shed in vain! We have received such external stimulation, and we can only feel even more heartbroken for those who are deliberately destroying domestic peace and reducing our international status. We urge the Communist troops to wash their hands quickly for the sake of the overseas Chinese. We must use the strength of domestic unity to save the millions of overseas Chinese in the East Indies!</p>

At 12:00 noon on the 4th, in the vicinity of Jiangzaogang, and in the Zhenchang and Yusha areas, there were more than 10,000 Communist troops, requisitioning civilian laborers. At the same time, six regiments of the Communist army were gathered in the Sanxuzhen area. At 10:00 PM on the 4th, they began to attack the Guanyinshan Nationalist army defense line. At that time, the Nationalist army calmly responded and fought bravely. The sound of cannons and machine guns was heard all night long, and the residents could hear it clearly. By 5:00 AM, the Communist army was gradually unable to support itself and was finally repelled by the Nationalist army. The Nationalist army suffered no losses. While the Huaiyin Executive Group was still mediating in the Nantong area, the Communist army acted in this way, which is a violation of good faith. It is not known how the group will handle this.</p>

<p>Another dispatch, Baipu, Rugao: The Communist army stationed in Linzi suddenly launched an attack on the eastern suburbs of Baipu Town at 12:30 AM on May 30 with a force of about 200 soldiers. After a calm response from the Nationalist army stationed there and the Rugao County Security Team, the attack was unsuccessful. A member of the executive group, who was traveling from Rugao to Nantong, after hearing the news, immediately sent US representative Brandhurst to inspect. He saw that the civilian houses in the area were riddled with bullets, and the new wheat and rice in the fields were trampled beyond recognition. They complained one after another. Lieutenant Colonel Brandhorst deeply regretted that the CCP's violation of the truce agreement was even more proven. (Zhi) Posted on the 5th</p>

<h3>Important US-Philippines Issues to be Resolved Before Philippine Independence</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 9th] With Philippine independence imminent, several critical issues concerning the Philippine Islands remain unresolved in the US Congress. Both American and Filipino parties insist that these issues should be decided before the Philippines' independence on July 4th, and are therefore urging Congress to take swift action. These issues are: (1) The Filipino Naturalization Act; (2) The Military Assistance Act; (3) A bill proposing the return of US government-owned Philippine securities worth $6.2 million to the islands; (4) The Aid to Philippine Veterans and their Families Act; (5) An urgent need to compile a budget for a $400 million loan to assist the Philippines in its post-war reconstruction.</p>
<p>While the above and many other issues urgently await resolution by the US and Philippine governments, plans for Washington and Manila to celebrate the July 4th Independence Day ceremonies are nearing completion. The United States has notified the 51 countries with which it maintains diplomatic relations of its intention to grant the Philippines independence, and Manila has invited representatives from all countries to attend the July 4th Independence Day ceremonies in Manila. (This newspaper was the first to report news of disturbances occurring in the Philippines yesterday.)</p>

<h3>Supplementing the Regular Air Force: US Forms Aviation Reserve, Engaging in Large-Scale Training at Bases Nationwide, Mobilizing 4.5 Million in Case of War</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 8th] The United States is currently organizing a "civilian" air force of 6,000 aircraft, with the ultimate goal of expanding this reserve of aviators to one million. According to the Department of the Army announcement, this potential air force, sufficient to supplement the US regular army, will consist of over 200,000 individuals engaging in part-time training at bases throughout the forty-eight states. The organization is divided into two parts: the "Air National Guard" and the "Air Reserve," a component of the regular army. Both will recruit volunteers using a conscription method similar to the army's initial recruitment at the beginning of the war. According to the planned design, the Air National Guard and Air Reserve will be under the command of Lieutenant General Stratemeyer's US Air Defense Command, headquartered at Mitchel Field on Long Island, New York. Stratemeyer served as the commander of the Allied Air Forces in the China-India-Burma Theater during World War II.</p>
<p>The Air Reserve plan will be implemented in July, with pilot training beginning at 130 military bases and gradually expanding to all aspects of air combat and air defense. The New York City air defense team is in the first batch of training, having launched a recruitment drive for 700 aviators. There will be 84 Air National Guard bases nationwide. Units will train for several hours each week, with more extensive training taking place for several weeks each summer. The peacetime US Air Force numbers approximately 875,000 personnel, a goal that can be reached through this second line of air defense training. In the event of war, this reserve, in addition to the regular army, would allow the United States to mobilize an air force of 4.5 million within twelve months of the start of hostilities.</p>
<p>In describing the importance of the Air National Guard and Air Reserve to the future of the United States, Stratemeyer stated, "In this age of air power and the atom, the superiority of the United States Air Force is the greatest guarantee of our nation's lasting peace and security. The superiority of the US Air Force is a legacy of the Second World War, and this legacy must be preserved until the United Nations can guarantee international security."</p>

<h3>Vincent's Speech: Security and Peace are Fundamental to Life</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Lexington, Kentucky, 8th] Treasury Secretary Vincent, who was appointed as Chief Justice of the United States by President Truman this week, stated last night that security and peace are fundamental to life. Americans need security and peace, and so do people in every other country in the world. Vincent made his remarks during a commencement speech at his alma mater, the University of Kentucky. He elucidated the general American views on freedom, security, and peace. He said, "We hope that the next generation will not have to shed blood and give their lives to preserve our way of life again. We need our country to maintain a strong position so that international thugs will not dare to run rampant and be able to defend ourselves in the event of another attack. Most importantly, we hope that all nations cooperate with each other to ensure that they do not violate each other. This is what we mean by the need for peace."</p>
<h3>US Special Forces to Conduct New Tests in Sub-Zero Climates, To Be Held This Winter</h3>

<h3>US to Consult the Far Eastern Commission for MacArthur to Secure Power; Administrative Report on the Occupation of Japan in May Published</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th, Combined Dispatches] Reliable sources: The United States is preparing subsequent measures to secure power for MacArthur at the Far Eastern Commission in Washington and has solicited MacArthur's opinions and criticisms of the proposed statement that has already been sent to Tokyo. It is reported that the US intends to publicly announce this statement to clarify its position on MacArthur's execution of the policy of occupying Japan, and will specifically point out the authority of the Far Eastern Commission, and the extent to which the Far Eastern Commission can oppose the directives issued directly to MacArthur by the US government.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 9th] MacArthur today released the May administrative report on the occupation of Japan, analyzing the gradual progress of democracy after Japan's liberation. It roughly stated that Japan does not desire revolution, nor reaction, but only orderly progress. The psychology of the Japanese people clearly seeks to avoid extremes, neither leaning to the left nor to the right. In the Japanese general election in April of this year, neither the Japanese government nor the Allied military authorities interfered, and the Japanese people were able to elect freely for the first time in decades. They chose a broad middle ground. The Japanese people continue to maintain a good attitude towards the occupation forces, and Japan has taken the first step on the path of establishing a responsible and popular government in the future. However, the Japanese political situation is still highly volatile, and the overlapping of political parties and candidates reflects the chaos of the transitional period. All activities of wartime political parties were strictly controlled by the government. Now that the shackles have been lifted, the activities of political parties are in a state of turmoil. It is not yet clear what will dominate the political life of Japan in the coming years, and the final party platform has yet to be drafted. However, one thing is certain: the suppression of Japanese political progress by the Japanese military and financial cliques has been largely removed. Japan is no longer a "police state," and the power of military manipulation of politics has disappeared. Since the issuance of the purge directive on January 4, most warmongers and extreme nationalists have been removed from office, and their qualifications as members of parliament have also been revoked.</p>
<h3>UN Secretary-General Lie to Visit Europe on a Regular Basis</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 8th] The Secretariat of the United Nations General Assembly has confirmed that Secretary-General Lie will fly to Europe by special plane on July 4th to inspect the automatic translation machine used by the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal and the agencies established by the United Nations in London and Geneva. It will take a month before he can return to New York.</p>
<h3>Terrible Bacterial Weapons</h3>
<p>Cost Much Smaller Than Atomic Bomb, Radioactive Effect a Thousand Times Greater Than Poison Gas</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 8th] Collier's magazine states that the United States currently has five agencies researching bacterial warfare tactics. Over the past three years, British, American, and Canadian scientists have invented many bacterial warfare weapons. If bacterial warfare were to be implemented today, its level of terror would exceed that of atomic warfare. The US Army began conducting bacterial warfare research in December 1943 and later collaborated with scientists from Canada and the United Kingdom. Cholera, bubonic plague, and sleeping sickness are the most obvious diseases in bacterial warfare. The cost of bacterial warfare weapons is only one-fortieth that of an atomic bomb, so small countries can also secretly manufacture bacterial warfare weapons by using their university laboratories, distilleries, etc., and avoid inspection by the Security Council. According to military experts, radioactive bacteria are a thousand times more effective than radioactive poison gas.</p>
<h3>Agreement Reached on Repatriation of Allied Assets in Italy, But Disputes Remain Over the Method of Repatriation, Anglo-French Views Close on Italian-Austrian Border Issue</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 9th] Bevin Spaak arrived in Paris this morning and immediately paid a visit to French Foreign Minister Bidault. Representatives of the four foreign ministers and economic experts met today to discuss ten key points in the issue of Italian compensation, especially the treatment of the property of Allied residents in Italy. The representatives agreed that Allied residents' property should be returned if documents are presented.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] The meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers continued at the Luxembourg Palace. The report drafted by the economic experts was first submitted for discussion. The main point is that all assets in Italy owned by Allied countries that were confiscated by the Fascist government should be returned to their original owners, and an agreement was immediately reached. The same issue was discussed in the afternoon for two hours and thirty minutes. This issue had been agreed upon in the morning, but the experts could not agree on the method of repatriation, and the representatives supported the opinions put forward by the experts of their respective countries, and did not give in to each other. The most important point is the issue of when the deadline should be for Allied people to request repatriation. The meeting is scheduled to continue tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 8th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin recently made a speech in the British House of Commons, involving the issue of the affiliation of the Italian Venice Giulia region. People here are deeply anxious after hearing about it, and they believe that the British government has accepted the border line proposed by France, which is very different from what the late US President Wilson advocated. From the perspective of the Italian people, the "Wilson Line" is actually beneficial to Italy. As for the suggestions put forward by France, they were only put forward because Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov insisted on his country's position, and were not unanimously approved by the meeting of the four foreign ministers.</p>

<p>Whether King Humberto II of Italy will leave the country before the republic is announced, or wait until after the government is handed over, has become the most important issue for the Italian people at the moment. According to people close to the King, Humberto himself seems to want to respect public opinion and is unwilling to leave the country too early, lest it cause confusion in legal procedures.</p>

<h3>East Indies Prepares to Use Force to Defend Sovereignty</h3>
<p>Forms National Defense Committee, Counter-Proposal to the Dutch Drafted</p>
<p>[United Press International, Batavia, 8th] East Indies Republic President Sukarno announced today that he has recruited representatives from the military, government, and political parties to form a National Defense Committee responsible for implementing emergency measures. He stated that if the Netherlands refuses to recognize the sovereignty of the East Indies and attempts to force the East Indies people to submit, then the East Indies people will respond with "force." Sukarno also hinted that the East Indies issue may be brought before the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 8th] Authoritative sources in Indonesia: Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir has completed Indonesia's counter-proposal and is prepared to submit it to the Dutch-Indonesian authorities. It is reported that its contents are roughly in line with what Sir Kerr had discussed when he came to Java.

<h3>Bamboo Leaf Bread, Insect Soy Sauce</h3>

<p>US Seamen Begin Negotiations with Employers, Threat of Strike May Disappear, Government Mediators Also Intensifying Efforts</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 9th] The threat of a strike by seamen belonging to the American Federation of Labor disappeared today, as the Seafarers International Union of North America has begun discussing wages and working hours with West Coast shipowners after holding a vote on the strike issue today. A spokesman for the shipowners said that the talks have made "real progress." This development has apparently dispelled the possibility of a simultaneous major strike in mid-month by seamen belonging to the two major American labor organizations (the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations). At the same time, government mediators in Washington are now intensifying efforts to lift the threat of a strike by seamen belonging to the Congress of Industrial Organizations, which is scheduled for the 16th of this month.</p>

They will travel to Boston on the French ship "France" on June 26 and then return to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>London in Fine Rain: Grand Victory Parade</h3>
<p>Column Stretches 18 Miles, Our Troops' High Spirits Highly Welcomed</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Approximately one hundred soldiers from the Chinese army participating in today's victory parade here were led by General Gui Yongqing, head of the Chinese military delegation in Britain. Everyone was full of spirit, positioned before the Allied ranks, marching through the streets, and receiving a warm welcome from the crowds.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] The victory parade held on London's streets today was of a scale unparalleled among the victory celebrations of the Allied nations. At 10 AM, the King, accompanied by the Queen and Princesses Elizabeth and Rose, departed from Buckingham Palace in an open-top four-wheeled carriage amidst the cheers of the crowd. The King wore a naval admiral's uniform, and the Queen wore a crimson formal dress with ostrich feathers adorning her hat, exuding grace and elegance. The carriage was drawn by Windsor's famous horses, guarded on both sides by brightly uniformed attendants. Simultaneously, prominent figures from all sectors of British society began to arrive at the official grandstand, which was decorated in cream and sea-green colors, with various military flags adorning the pillars, symbolizing the British Empire and its Dominions. Along the Mall, where the military parade took place, the flags of the United Nations fluttered in the fine rain. When former Prime Minister Churchill and current Prime Minister Attlee arrived at the grandstand, the crowds cheered enthusiastically and continuously. Two columns of soldiers began their march from the barracks under a gloomy, rain-threatening sky, stretching for eighteen miles. Ahead of the mechanized units were several open-top cars carrying the commanders of the British Empire's various armed forces. Wherever Montgomery passed, the crowds cheered loudly. After the entire royal family was seated, the British flag was lowered amidst melodious music and replaced with the royal standard. Ten days after the Allied landings in Normandy last year, the King personally inspected the bridgehead, and this was the flag used to welcome the King to the battlefield. As the chimes of Westminster Abbey echoed, the first infantry units approached the official grandstand, including units from the Allied nations: China, the United States, France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Norway, Brazil, Mexico, and Transjordan. The crowds were greatly excited as the infantry waited for the mechanized units at the Charing Cross intersection. Candies and cigarettes flew from all directions toward the soldiers' heads, like small bombs, followed by "large bombs" like oranges, apples, and sweet potatoes, with bananas being the most popular. Cups of tea were constantly passed down from windows, relayed by the crowds below to quench the soldiers' thirst. This demonstration of sympathy greatly moved the troops. Finally, amidst extreme noise, the mechanized column arrived, and the parade continued, led by motorized units, turning from Whitehall Street onto the Mall, which was the central location for the review. Immediately after the mechanized units passed, another spectacle presented itself: three hundred and eight Royal Air Force aircraft piercing through the clouds in a stunning display. The roar of the engines was like the Battle of Britain erupting again. At night, London shone brightly, like daytime, with hundreds of searchlights crisscrossing in the sky, further enhanced by fireworks, making the people happily forget to return home.</p>
<h3>British Troops Celebrate Victory in Camps, Anti-British Riots Erupt in Egypt</h3>
<p>Hand Grenades Thrown Everywhere, General Strike Fails to Materialize</p>
<p>[Reuters, Alexandria, 8th] British troops today celebrated their victory only within their camps to avoid incidents. The Alexandria Labor Union issued a call for a general strike, but it failed to materialize due to the strong measures taken by Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi, though individual incidents such as hand grenade throwing still occurred in several parts of the city. Police in the Sidi Gaber district found a basket of hand grenades, two of which exploded; a grenade also exploded in a building under construction, injuring four workers. Several British soldiers were injured by grenade attacks while returning to their camps, with four wounded. Two other British soldiers were beaten up by six Egyptians on the streets at night. No British soldiers were seen on the streets today, and the camp gates were tightly closed. There were two small-scale demonstrations in the city, both dispersed by the police.</p>
<h3>Watching the Lively Scene at Home Via Television</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] People miles away who could not participate in the grand occasion all used television to watch the lively parade scene. Residents of Hyde, 170 miles away, were also able to see the London victory parade on television.</p>

<h3>Glorious Demobilization of the Youth Army: First Batch Arrives in Shanghai This Afternoon; Deputy Division Commander Gu Reports on the Process to Reporters; Welcome Ceremony to be Held at the Majestic Theatre Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The national Youth Army has begun demobilization. The 208th and 209th Divisions in the Southeast region have been concentrated in Hangzhou and will be transported back to their hometowns in batches starting today. The first batch of over two thousand demobilized Youth Army soldiers from the Shanghai Headquarters is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by train from Hangzhou this morning, arriving at the North Station around 1 PM. The advance "establishment" contingent, which came to Shanghai earlier to arrange everything, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is setting up barracks in places like Yang Guopu and Fuxing Island.</p>
<p>Reporting on the Organization, Training, and Demobilization Process</p>
<p>Gu Rongjun, Deputy Division Commander of the 209th Division, held a special reception for the Shanghai press at the Dadong Restaurant at 3 PM yesterday to report on the general situation of the organization, training, and demobilization of the Youth Army in the Southeast region. Gu first reported on the establishment of the Youth Army, saying: "When the enemy launched the Gui-Liu Campaign in the 33rd year [1944], and the domestic situation in our country became extremely tense, the Supreme Commander issued a call on April 24th of the 33rd year, and a total of 130,000 young people responded to the call and joined the army. After screening, more than 86,000 were qualified and organized into nine youth divisions (201st to 209th Divisions) and two independent regiments. The 208th and 209th Divisions were established in the Southeast region, and officers and trainers were selected by the Southeast Branch of the Military Affairs Commission. Preparations began in the first month of the lunar year last year [February 1945]. At that time, a total of 32,000 young people from the Southeast region participated in the Youth Army, and more than 28,000 passed the examination. The Supreme Commander then promulgated three principles for the organization and training of the Youth Army: 1. Select the most outstanding cadres; 2. Complete the organization and training in the shortest possible time; 3. Achieve excellent skills in a short period. Each division was matched with three regiments and one independent regiment, along with ordinary soldiers (cooks, messengers, orderlies, etc., conscripted by the division headquarters). The two divisions had a total of 36,000 people, equivalent to the number of two ordinary armies. After three months of effort, general military education was completed. Not only were the two Southeast divisions completed in such a short period, but all nine youth divisions nationwide were completed on schedule at the same time. This was because the Youth Army had extremely high quality, combined with excellent education, thus achieving this unprecedented result."</p>
<p>Once Prepared to Receive Taiwan</p>
<p>"After the victory was achieved in August last year, the 208th and 209th Divisions were ordered to march to Fuzhou for concentration, preparing to receive Taiwan. All the young officers and soldiers marched on foot for a month, arriving in Nanping, Fujian. Due to a change in plans by the General Headquarters, they were ordered to move to eastern Zhejiang. The 208th Division stationed in the Fuchun River area, and the 209th Division stationed in Yuyao and Shaoxing, and at the same time implemented reserve officer education. The Youth Army's military and political cadres were trained by Chiang Ching-kuo in Jiangxi. Some of the cadres were selected from the Youth Army, and some were recruited from outside, and they had also completed their training."</p>
<p>Implementation of Higher Education and Career Change Separately</p>
<p>"The demobilization of the Youth Army was originally scheduled to be delayed for another year. However, because most of the Youth Army were middle school students and urgently needed to pursue higher education early, it seemed a pity to keep most of the young people in the army, wasting their study time. Therefore, it was decided to retire them early. With the exception of the 207th Division, all other youth divisions were demobilized. According to each person's wishes, those who wished to pursue higher education would pursue higher education, those who wished to find employment would find employment, and those who wished to stay in the army would stay in the army. The detailed methods had been planned before the demobilization and have now begun to be implemented."</p>
<p>As for the transportation problem of demobilization, the entire Youth Army in the Southeast region is divided into two parts: the Marine Headquarters and the Yangtze River Headquarters. The ocean takes Shanghai as the first destination, and the Yangtze River takes Nanjing as the first destination.</p>

<p>Recently, the shipping industry in this city, upon hearing that the Supreme National Defense Council had decided to "temporarily open the navigation rights of Nanjing, Hankou, Wuhu, and Jiujiang for one year," believed that it was humiliating to the country and threatened the survival of the domestic shipping industry.

Mr. Du agreed to meet with the reporter, and the reporter asked the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) The newspaper reported yesterday that the Shipowners' Association held an emergency meeting yesterday. Was Mr. Du the chairman, and what was the result of the meeting? Mr. Du replied: "The reorganization of the Shipowners' Association has just been established recently. Although the board of directors elected me as the chairman, I have not yet agreed to take office due to my poor health and busy schedule. Now, because shipping colleagues and other shipping organizations have launched a movement to protect rights, several important directors of the Shipowners' Association came to my residence yesterday to discuss and urge me to take office as soon as possible. As I am sick in bed, I can only exchange simple opinions and have not held a formal meeting." (2) What is your opinion on this case? He replied: "The specific plan for our country's shipping industry has been discussed many times. This can be seen from President Chiang's book "China's Destiny," which specifically emphasized and mentioned that "a shipping plan of three million tons must be completed within ten years." It can be seen that maintaining the shipping industry is an established national policy, with common interests between officials and businessmen. The National Defense Council's decision to temporarily open the four places of Beijing, Tianjin, Xunyang, and Hanzhong for one year may have other painstaking efforts in the government, but the response felt by the shipping industry is indeed very significant. In my opinion, our country's economy is currently at a critical juncture, and I hope that the government and the public will be united, calm, and discuss a win-win solution together to overcome difficulties and gradually seek revitalization, rather than mutually blaming each other. I heard that President Song has returned to Shanghai. I hope that the shipping industry will elect representatives to directly present all kinds of difficulties to President Song and that President Song will humbly accept them."</p>

<h3>Trademark Infringement Case: Wilson Loses the Lawsuit</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press" on June 6th, the Jiangsu Higher Court has affirmed the Shanghai District Court's judgment as reasonable in the Shanghai Williams Medicine Co.'s lawsuit against Wilson Pharmaceutical Factory for trademark infringement. The court found that the Chinese name used by the defendant, Wilson Pharmaceutical Factory (韦廉士药局), was indeed intentionally imitated from the plaintiff, Williams Medicine Co. In addition, the defendant was also guilty of counterfeiting the plaintiff's various trademarks, such as Williams Medicine Co.'s Red Pills and Red Cleansing Pills. Therefore, the defendant was ordered to stop manufacturing, selling, or distributing these counterfeit medicines, and ordered to recall all the counterfeit medicines on the market, remove and destroy the labels affixed to them that were similar to the genuine trademarks. It has been found that the above-mentioned counterfeit medicines were discovered after the Pearl Harbor incident. At that time, the British and American staff of the plaintiff's company were all in concentration camps. Therefore, Xu Zagong, Ling Xinde, Yang Jiaquan, and Xu Liangkun, former employees of the company, colluded with Wang Danqing, the company's printer, and Cheng Meisheng to initiate the manufacture of the above-mentioned counterfeit products. The lawyers representing the plaintiff yesterday were Almann and Li Zemin.</p>

<h3>Increased Tax Revenue in the City; Municipal Budget Expected to be Balanced</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The reporter recently visited Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, to inquire about the current revenue and expenditure situation of the Municipal Government, and the measures for increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Director Gu was busy with official duties and delegated his secretary, Tang Xingyi, to meet with the reporter. Tang reported that the revenue and expenditure situation of the Municipal Government for last month had not yet been clearly accounted for, so details could not be provided. However, it was learned that the income from the urban area under the jurisdiction of the bureau last month was approximately 3 billion yuan. As for the balanced budget of the municipal finance, the summer housing tax for this year has begun to be collected according to the new rent rate (that is, residential rent has increased by 140 times compared to before, and business rent has increased by 180 times). Therefore, the increase in housing tax revenue is expected to compensate for a portion of the expenditure. In addition, the central government will transfer business tax, deed tax, land price tax, and other taxes to local financial institutions for collection from July 1st of this year. In the case of this city, the income from business tax alone is very large. Therefore, after this new tax source is transferred to the Finance Bureau for self-collection, it can be expected to increase the tax revenue of the Municipal Government. The city's financial budget will be more easily balanced.</p>

<h3>Sino-American Hospital Fully Equipped with American Equipment Starts Providing Medical Services Starting the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) The Sino-American Hospital on Beijing Road, formerly the German-run Paulun Hospital, has recently been taken over by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization. All equipment has been shipped from the United States, making it the most modern and well-equipped hospital in the city. The hospital is scheduled to begin providing medical services on the 12th of this month. The date of the official opening is still pending. As this hospital has always been one of the most prestigious hospitals in the city, its transformations are of great concern to the citizens. Therefore, the reporter paid a special visit yesterday to the hospital's president, Ding Boxiong. He was told that the hospital currently has 426 beds, but only 333 are currently available for use, including 110 first-class and second-class beds, and the rest are third-class beds. The Paulun Hospital equipment taken over by the hospital and the medical supplies shipped from the United States are all unpacked under the strict supervision of the responsible persons, and there is no possibility of leakage. However, it is true that some medicines were found to have broken glass bottles when unpacked, resulting in considerable losses. All kinds of medical equipment shipped from the United States this time are the latest models, and some are even never seen in Shanghai before. However, the American subsidy is limited to this one time only, and how to supplement it in the future depends entirely on our own efforts. The hospital is currently hiring experts in the United States. As for the doctors currently hired, there are 40 full-time doctors and more than 20 part-time doctors. Part-time doctors must be on duty at the hospital for at least three hours a day. The hospital's biggest difficulty now is the water and heating system. The water and heating pipes of the former Paulun Hospital have been completely dismantled by the enemy troops, so it is urgent to find another way to solve the problem. In the future, it is also planned to establish a medical school to make the hospital the "Peking Union Medical College" of Shanghai.</p>

<p>In the high jump, Zhang Banglun got 1.52 meters in the second jump. Wang Yuguang tried his best in the third jump and got 1.6670 meters, winning the championship, and Xi Baimingxing won the second place.</p>
<p>In the javelin, Wang Xuewu and Zhu Ziqing competed against each other, which caused them to lose a lot of competitive interest. Wang Xuewu threw it casually and got 52 meters without any effort. It is a pity that Wang had a cramp in his foot, otherwise it would not be difficult to break the 55-meter mark.</p>
<p>10,000-Meter Final</p>
<p>There were many long-distance running athletes participating in the 10,000-meter final, and the interest was strong. Jiang Xiangqing fired the gun, and they had to run 25 laps around the field. Dumb Lou Wen'ao took the lead, and Liu Guangfa followed closely. However, after the sixth lap, Liu could not support it and retreated. As a result, Dumb won the first place with a score of 36 minutes and 8.3 seconds. The second place was Liu Guangfa, who was about 600 meters behind.</p>
<p>The 100-meter final was the last program. Zhu Shafei led the way, but unfortunately he was surpassed by Tan Qing in the last 30 meters. Tan finally reached the finish line first with a score of 24.9 seconds, and Zhu was second.</p>
<p>Looking at yesterday's results, the performance was significantly affected due to the hot weather and strong winds, so there were no outstanding results. The men's 400-meter, javelin, long jump, and triple jump were still barely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Men's and Women's Championships</p>
<p>In the men's and women's overall scores, the men's champion was Tan Qing, who scored a total of 17 points. He won the first place in the three short-distance events, which was very rare. The runner-up was Wang Xuewu with 13 points, and the third place was Song Ziqing with 11 points. The women's champion was Yuan Pinli with 16 points, and Lin Jianfen and Zhuang Luyi were tied for the runner-up with 15 points each. It is noted that the men's champion Tan Qing, the runner-up Wang Xuewu, and the women's runner-up Lin Jianxiu are all athletes from the Youth Sixth Detachment. After the competition, the awards were presented by Shen Kunnan, Chairman of the Track and Field Committee. The men's champion received the Mayor Wu Silver Cup, the Education Director's pennant, the runner-up received the Wu Chairman Silver Cup, the Finance Director's pennant, and the third place received the Middle School pennant. The women's champion received the Mayor Wu Silver Cup, the Land Administration Director's silver shield, the Works Director's pennant. The two runners-up received the Commander Xuan's pennant, Cao Secretary's pennant, and the Shanghai Badge Factory Silver Cup. Finally, the Secretary-General gave a thank you speech. The event ended successfully at five o'clock.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Expeditionary Force Reports Another Victory Eastern Stars Beat Western Allies Result Four to One Each Team Scores One Goal in the First Half Tense and Fierce Competition Stamina Determines Victory</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Expeditionary Football Eastern Stars team played against the best Westerners in Shanghai, the Western Allies, at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon under the hot sun. More fans than the first game came to watch, about 20,000 people, and the situation was even more enthusiastic. The referee was Zhang Le, the linesmen were Chen Jixiang and Fadafu. As a result, the first half was one to one, and the winner was not determined. In the second half, Zhang Jinhai scored, and Li Zhaorong scored twice, resulting in a four-to-one victory for the expeditionary force. The lineups of the two armies are recorded below:</p>
<p>Eastern Stars</p>

<p>Savin Xu Erz</p>
<p>Griffith Oliveira Tiefuni (off) Hanni Bo (on)</p>
<p>Pantun Mackey Tang Roberts Stoff Carol Lych Liao Chai (off) Remy Dee (on)</p>
<h3>Key to Yesterday's Victory and Defeat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's competition was tense and exciting. The number of wins and losses was completely determined by stamina. In the first half, the Western Allies fought with all their strength, and the Eastern Stars were almost trapped, and they could not attack repeatedly. The fans were worried that the Eastern Stars' luck was not good. Bao Baozhong, a veteran, was powerful and saved countless dangerous balls. In the second half, the Western Allies were exhausted and lost another goal, and the whole army collapsed. The situation in the first and second halves was completely different. The Eastern Stars won because they were young and strong and had better stamina.</p>
<h3>No Victory or Defeat in the First Half</h3>
<p>At 5:30, the whistle blew to start the game. The expeditionary force kicked off, Zhang Jinhai sent Feng Jingxiang, Jingxiang dribbled the ball quickly, and was blocked by Oliveira. The Western Allies counterattacked, and Huang Mao Roberts Stoff went deep into the penalty area. Hou Rongsheng came out to relieve the siege. In less than a minute, Deng Guangsen passed to the left, and Li Zhaorong shot in the air. The posture was excellent, and Qin Baozhong easily saved it. Mackey Tang Carol Lych attacked with two shots at the same time. Xu Jingcheng retreated to defend, and the Western Allies returned without success. At 20 minutes, Xiao Huangmao ran rampant and actually knocked on the door. Zhu Zhaoheng pounced to save, but only touched it with one hand. Fortunately, it hit the crossbar and was not poisoned. In the melee at 37 minutes, Remy Dee got support and went deep into the hinterland, opening the gate of Eastern Stars at six or seven yards, one to zero. The Western Allies took the lead. At this time, Hanni Bo replaced Tiefuni, and Eastern Stars took advantage of the opportunity. Zhang Jinhai immediately returned a goal, one to one, and the first half was not divided.</p>
<h3>Western Allies Collapse</h3>
<p>After the break, the Eastern Stars adjusted their personnel. Liu Songsheng and Feng Kansheng successively joined Luo and Guo, the two midfielders. The Western Allies also replaced Lei Midei with Luo Rongyuan. After another conflict, the Western Allies gradually showed fatigue, and the guest army was strong. At 20 minutes, Feng Kunsheng kissed the ball in the vicinity of the penalty area. Mackey Tang took the penalty, and Xiao Huangmao's offside was not counted. After five minutes, Xu Jingcheng advanced in the middle, and Zhaorong sent Xiao Zhang. Jinhai raised his foot and slammed hard, and the enemy door opened, two to one. The Eastern Stars came from behind. At this time, the Western Allies could only parry and could not counterattack. At 30 minutes, Lao Feng knocked on the door, Savin was invincible, and blocked the ground. Jinhai took the opportunity to snatch, and Zhaorong did score, three to one, and the Eastern Stars won another city. In the last five minutes, Li Shunyou cut in from the left line. As soon as the ball landed, Zhaorong pressed a foot, unexpectedly, and the ball had entered the net from the upper right corner, four to one, and another one came. Before long, the statutory time ended, and the expeditionary force defeated the Western Allies with four to one.</p>

<h3>A Humble Opinion on the Development of Cultural Enterprises in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Liu Xian (Part 1)</p>
<p>History tells us that since Shanghai opened as a port, it has been more than a hundred years, during which it has experienced many disturbances and wars, but it has been fortunate enough to be preserved and has not been devastated. Even in the case of the Sino-Japanese War and its expansion into the Pacific War, after eight long years, Shanghai's position was so important that it could have been destroyed. However, once the stubborn enemy surrendered, the situation turned from danger to safety, and the city remained unscathed. This is Shanghai's good fortune and the blessing of Shanghai's residents. Furthermore, because of the victory in the War of Resistance and the decline of Tokyo, Shanghai has leaped to become the largest metropolis in East Asia, standing in stark contrast to San Francisco across the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is said that Shanghai now has a population of four million (the results of the recent census have not yet been released, so it is difficult to obtain accurate figures), making it the sixth largest metropolis in the world. In the past, due to the concessions, commerce developed abnormally, the market was exceptionally prosperous, Chinese and foreigners lived together, and Westernization was very deep. It was truly "ten miles of foreign concessions, filled with imported horses and fragrant grass, tea houses and restaurants, green wine and red lanterns, theaters and dance halls, extravagant and intoxicating, singing and dancing until dawn, a city that never sleeps," providing the utmost enjoyment of material civilization. However, when it comes to cultural development, Shanghai is extremely poor and backward. Compared with a European or American city with a population of four million, there is a real world of difference.</p>
<p>"The past cannot be undone, but the future can be pursued." Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the concessions have been recovered, extraterritoriality has been abolished, and municipal administration is unified and autonomous, all kinds of excuses that previously hindered the city's cultural development have been swept away. We should now seize this precious opportunity, take a long-term view, learn from the past, and build a modern Shanghai, not only with material prosperity and commercial success, but also with a higher cultural level, increased citizen welfare, and a transformation of frivolous customs.</p>
<p>The scope of cultural undertakings is very broad. How should we start construction? I believe there should be an overall plan, a large amount of funding, a distinction between urgency and delay, and a time limit for implementation. The scope can include schools, especially universities, research institutes, libraries, museums, zoos, botanical gardens, observatories, art galleries, music halls, national opera houses, opera houses, literary and art centers, etc. Please allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p>(1) Schools</p>
<p>Shanghai has always had many schools, but because of the war and poor security in various places, people with some money have moved to Shanghai, causing a surge in Shanghai's population. The number of students has also increased proportionally. After the victory, the government was restored, and even more people came to Shanghai from the interior. The number of students coming to Shanghai with their families is also increasing day by day. However, the number of schools in Shanghai has not increased much. On the contrary, many schools have been closed down because of their relationship with the enemy and puppets. Therefore, whether it is elementary school, middle school, or university, the supply is insufficient, and there is a great problem of overcrowding. To solve the problem of youth being out of school, the municipal government should promptly establish more elementary and middle schools to meet the urgent need. As for universities, there were more than ten universities in Shanghai. During the War of Resistance, most of them moved inland or were destroyed. Private universities are not worth mentioning for the time being. The restoration of national universities is still pending. Furthermore, it is said that Jinan University, which was originally located in Shanghai, will be moved to Nanjing in the future, and Fudan University will be moved to Wuxi. In the future, only Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai Business College, and Shanghai Conservatory of Music will remain. These schools are all of a specialized nature. In fact, Shanghai does not have a national university that is scientifically complete and grand in scale, like Central University, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Sun Yat-sen University, or Wuhan University. Shanghai is the largest metropolis in China, with a population of four million. It is an international outlook and a center for cultural exchange. According to reason and logic, a top-level institution of higher learning should be established for "culture for the sake of culture and scholarship for the sake of scholarship" to meet the needs of the post-war era.</p>
<p>(2) Research Institutes</p>
<p>Research institutes are the source of culture and the highest peak of cultural standards. Every major city in Europe and the United States has many research institutions engaged in research in various academic fields. A metropolis like Shanghai, with its developed industry and commerce but backward science, has many scientific, industrial, municipal, or other local problems that need to be researched and solved. Although the Academia Sinica has several research institutes in Shanghai, most of them are engaged in geographical or humanistic research, and rarely study local problems. In order to solve many local problems or technical problems of industrial and commercial enterprises, the municipal government should establish many research institutes. Research institutes may seem to be consumption-oriented rather than production-oriented to the general public. However, what invention in the world, what thing that benefits life, does not come from research?</p>
<p>(3) Libraries</p>
<p>Libraries are treasure troves of knowledge. Although Shanghai has several libraries, and there is a municipal library, they are all too small in scale, with little funding. Furthermore, the municipal library is located in Jiangwan, which is too far from the city center, and transportation is inconvenient, making it difficult to fully utilize. I believe that Shanghai is so large and has such a large population that it should establish at least one large-scale library with hundreds of thousands of books, similar to the National Central Library or the Peking Library. In addition to ordinary reading, it should also be used for research. Furthermore, many branch libraries should be set up and distributed in the main areas of the city, like post offices, so that citizens can easily access books for reading. As for specialized libraries, they should be established as much as possible, so that books from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, can be found in Shanghai. Only with libraries can we study knowledge and contribute to culture.</p>
<p>(4) Museums</p>
<p>Like libraries, museums are also a major part of cultural undertakings. Shanghai still does not have a decent museum. When foreigners come to Shanghai and want to see Chinese cultural relics and art, there is simply no suitable place to visit. I advocate that a large-scale museum should be established in Shanghai as soon as possible. First, it can show the civilization of our country, and second, it can provide people with a place to visit and receive the benefits of social education. Various specialized museums should also be established, such as science museums, natural history museums, folk museums, hygiene museums, children's museums, etc., to promote social education and increase citizens' knowledge.</p>
<p>(5) Zoos</p>
<p>Every modern city has a zoo. A zoo is a living museum. With China's vast territory and diverse regions, and the variety of animal species, it is not difficult to find many rare species. Raising them together for citizens to visit and for experts to study is a very meaningful thing. Unfortunately, China is lagging behind in everything, and the government pays little attention. There are no zoos in major cities. Although animals have been raised in the Shanghai Confucian Temple, Zhaofeng Park, and French Park in the past, the facilities were too rudimentary, there were too few animals, and the breeding was not very effective. As a result, the lions and tigers died after being raised for a while. I think Shanghai should establish the most modern and scientific zoo, on a scale as large as the one in Hamburg, Germany. Experts should be hired to manage it. Don't let Kang-produced giant pandas, the rare treasures of the world, not be seen in Shanghai, but instead be raised in the zoo in New York, USA. This is truly a regrettable thing for the Chinese academic community, because we don't have a good zoo!</p>
<p>Shanghai is located on the coast, with many marine products. In addition to the zoo, a special aquarium should also be established, specializing in raising all kinds of beautiful aquatic animals, especially beautiful fish like angelfish. I suggest establishing a large-scale aquarium to raise aquatic animals. On the one hand, it has educational significance, and on the other hand, it can be used for enjoyment and has economic value. It is a worthwhile undertaking with multiple benefits. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Divination</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>——That dreamlike life did not evoke even a faint longing in me. But for the sake of these kind and lovely people, I am willing to remember this leisurely mood forever, to remember this elegant affair.——</p>
<p>Hanli's room always has a hazy, dreamlike atmosphere. Even in summer, she doesn't like to draw back the gauze on the windows and the curtains on the doors, let alone in late spring?</p>
<p>Therefore, the quiet courtyard and the drooping curtains are even more like a dreamscape in the lingering sunset.</p>
<p>Therefore, in Hanli's room, we always love to talk in our sleep, absurdly, childishly, fantasizing... but we never find it ridiculous, nor do we ever feel tired.</p>
<p>There were several books on the table, placed randomly, as if no one had organized them for days.</p>
<p>"Lazy child, let me tidy up for you!" Zhao Yin carefully arranged them one by one, picked up a thin, large magazine, and said, "Let me divine my fate."</p>
<p>She turned to a page with a beautiful picture of a young woman, with the famous lines by the poet Xia Zhi-lin underneath: "The bright moon decorates your window, you decorate people's dreams."</p>
<p>We all laughed.</p>
<p>"That's completely irrelevant." She threw the book away.</p>
<p>"You can say that again! It's a perfect answer, and only you deserve it." Hanli gave her a playful glance, then turned around and smiled softly, "Let me try too." She closed her eyes, solemn as could be, and reverently touched a book, a small brown book, murmuring, "Page thirty-six, line six;" then, she carefully read out each word: "I have not been indifferent, nor have I criticized, nor have I calculated..."</p>
<p>What an incredible sentence! No one reacted because everyone was pondering. I was the first to jump up and shout, "Heavens! How can it be so accurate?"</p>
<p>We thought about it again and realized it was very true.</p>
<p>I didn't expect this childish game to arouse people's interest, especially in Hanli. She told me, "You should try it too, it's this little book, it's very accurate."</p>
<p>I casually opened a page and blurted out, "I want the most unlucky number, the thirteenth line." Hanli read for me, "Ah, that is the fairy spring where longing and forgetting are left behind!"</p>
<p>Is it because I have too many memories? Yet who doesn't find the past worth cherishing?</p>
<p>I was speechless, and they felt that this answer was both like and unlike.</p>
<p>"It's my turn!" Yi Qing said. She picked up a finely made, thick book with a smile: "Page one hundred and four, line twelve."</p>
<p>However, when we went to look at the place she was pointing to, that page, that line, happened to have not a single word, only a punctuation mark: "?"</p>
<p>"It's not accurate, it's not accurate. You didn't offer incense, so the God Guan Yu won't answer your prayers." Hanli snatched the book and threw it heavily on the table.</p>
<p>The smile on Yi Qing's face gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>Thus we whiled away a quiet twilight of late spring, in that quiet room.</p>
<h3>Sketches from the Sculpture Studio</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>——The Origin of Sculpture</p>
<p>According to archaeologists and art historians, sculpture arose and developed earlier than painting. Whether this is true or not is debatable. In any case, in the earliest primitive times, sculpture and painting were inseparable. Therefore, we can call it the "undifferentiated era" or "mixed era" of sculpture and painting.</p>
<p>To explain the significance of the emergence of sculpture from the perspective of humanity's innate ability to create form: from a vertical perspective, as far back as the sculptures of primitive Greece and Egypt; from a horizontal perspective, as in the sculptures of the natives of Southeast Asia and Africa today, and even the clay crafts made by children that we see every day, it can be said that all of them originate from human instinct.</p>
<p>Human instinct is subconscious admiration and astonishment for the "quantity" and "volume" of objects.——As large as towering mountains, as small as apples and cherries, when people see or touch them, they unconsciously experience pleasure, goodwill, and astonished admiration. To satisfy themselves or to record the things they feel and the emotions of the moment, they take materials from the immediate surroundings, either molding clay into shapes, carving stones, or using writing and drawing as text... This is what is called human instinct. It is also the germination of the instinct for art in general.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier: people are driven by their instinctive love for the "quantity" of objects, and sculpture arose. This primitive love then promotes people's desire to create form. On top of this innate instinct, external aesthetic stimuli are integrated. Thus, the so-called "art of sculpture" is formally produced. In other words, the art of sculpture is not only a part of human culture, but can also be said to be the oldest seed of human culture.</p>
<p>——Primitive Sculpture</p>
<p>When humanity was fighting against beasts in the primitive era, they used wisdom to overcome brute force. The stone sticks, stone axes, and stone knives created by wisdom can be said to be the sparks of the art of sculpture. Later, after thousands of years, in the so-called early Quaternary period, humans were forced by the times to take refuge in caves, still living by hunting, wearing animal skins, eating animal meat, burning animal oil, and using animal bones to make various small daily necessities. In their spare time, they carved patterns on these tools, mostly animal shapes using animal horns and bones. There are also many strange shapes, like musical symbols. Although their meaning cannot be deciphered, the knife work and images are extremely simple and interesting. In particular, the line carvings on the small knife handles made of deer antlers unearthed in Spain, France, and other places in recent years make people yearn for them. It seems to be telling us that human life is not only for simple "matter." We should entrust our spirit to something with longevity, so that we can always evoke sweet memories and dreamlike thoughts. This is human instinct, the difference between humans and beasts, and the essence of the art of sculpture.</p>
<p>Serial Novel</p>
<h3>Flying Together (15)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Then he should learn to walk, he told Liao Dong, a real man cannot always crawl under other people's crotches to live!</p>
<p>Liao Dong cannot be said to be unaffected by Bao Ling's enlightenment, but he is still young after all, and doesn't quite understand life. Although at twelve years old, he is almost as tall as the eighteen-year-old Bao Ling, his knowledge is inferior to Bao Ling's, so he doesn't quite understand Bao Ling's meaning. Sometimes when he cries, Bao Ling laughs at him, and he feels that Bao Ling is mocking him. Naturally, he trusts Bao Ling in what she says, for example, he studies very hard, and with his intelligence, he progresses very quickly. Because he is still a child after all, his sadness and melancholy are not very profound. So since Bao Ling came, he has gradually become happier and more lively! This may be the other side of his latent personality, and this side may be real; the pessimistic side is created by the human environment!</p>
<p>Since Bao Ling came, she has never angered the old lady. Old Liao often reminded the old lady intentionally or unintentionally, "You can't judge people by appearances, who would have thought that Master Mo's son would now be our bookkeeper?" Seeing that Old Liao treated Bao Ling differently, the old lady could not help but treat him a little better. But once, because Bao Ling and Liao Dong were reading books late at night, not sleeping for a long time, the old lady woke up and saw the lights were still bright in their room, so she couldn't help but shout.</p>
<p>"What do you do all day? Why don't you drop dead? It's not your oil you're burning, is it?"</p>
<p>Bao Ling wanted to answer her, "That's right, it's the old lady's oil you're burning, so the old lady feels the pain!" But Liao Dong wouldn't let him talk back either. Because Liao Dong knew how fierce the tigress was, if she got angry, she wouldn't dare do anything to Bao Ling, and Liao Dong's flesh would suffer! So from then on, they no longer openly read books with the lights on. And there was no free time during the day, so Liao Dong came up with a solution, he put the lamp under the bed, and they sat on the ground and worked hard as usual.</p>
<p>The old lady rarely had a smiling face, unless the business was particularly good that day, or her Liao Dong amused her. Because money was her first life; her son was her second life; all day long she was either counting accounts with her toes or trying to coax her precious darling to play. On others, she was stingy, but on her son, she was willing to spend! Naturally, she was not stingy with her husband and herself either, she was very considerate of her husband's daily life and very willing to satisfy her own enjoyment. But compared to her son, she was still a little less willing. In this way, the son was spoiled! Little Liao Dong had already developed into a complete soft-bodied animal type. The old lady did not feel that this was a mistake, and continued to instill the poison of spoiling!</p>

<h3>Monthly Arrivals Only 140,000 Tons; Coal for Factories a Problem; Fuel Control Committee to Hold Meeting to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The coal supply for this city largely depends on the Fuel Control Committee, but coal dealers also receive a small portion for allocation and resale to civilians, though the amount is very small. It is heard that the coal industry is repeatedly requesting the Fuel Committee to handle all coal used for factory production and resell it to factories in order to maintain the livelihoods of coal industry workers. The Fuel Committee will hold a meeting to discuss this matter in the next two to three days. However, with considerable opposition from the industrial sector, it is feared that their wishes will not be fulfilled. Currently, the Fuel Control Committee can allocate about 30,000 tons of coal per month for factory use in this city. Among these, state-owned yarn factories, silk factories, and paper mills account for about half, while the remaining half consists of about 10,000 tons for various factories and about 5,000 tons for coal dealers. It is said that the price at which coal dealers receive their allocation can be reduced by 10,000 yuan. The allocation of coal for public utilities, such as trains, electricity, gas, and military-use ships for rehabilitation, requires 80,000 tons per month, and the price is naturally much lower than the aforementioned factory-use coal. According to news from various industrial trade associations, although the procedures for allocating coal by the Fuel Control Committee are not yet ideal, the goods belong to the factories themselves, and there are few malpractices in terms of quality and tonnage. Moreover, although the allocated price is slightly higher than that of coal dealers, the allocation is direct, and monopolization and control can still be prevented. If all coal is allocated and resold by coal dealers, it may not be so convenient. Regarding the bankruptcy situation in various places, it is heard that Kailuan currently produces 300,000 tons per month. Besides supplying railways like Beining and Jingsui and civilian use in its vicinity, 120,000 tons are shipped from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai each month. Jilong coal in Taiwan produces 100,000 tons per month, of which 20,000 tons can be shipped to Shanghai. The source of coal for this region comes from here. All coal used by power plants along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines must also rely on the Shanghai Coal Committee. In addition, the Huainan mine can produce 30,000 tons per month. Except for 10,000 tons needed locally, 20,000 tons are transported to Nanjing. All public-use coal for the Nanjing to Hankou area is taken from here. The Huadong mine can produce about 25,000 tons of coal per month, which must be supplied to the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, and cannot be supplied to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Recovered Last Week; Securities Transactions All Up; Gold Prices Stable, US Dollars Busy</h3>
<p>Last week, the spot gold trend was fairly stable. Due to the preparation for the reopening of the securities exchange, the stock market was buoyant and thriving. Government bonds were actively traded by both bulls and bears, with prices fluctuating rapidly. Importers of US dollars aggressively bought from the black market, causing prices to rise. Foreign stocks initially rose but then weakened. Rice prices were consistently weak, but a slight turnaround was seen on Saturday. The situation in each sector is described below.</p>
<p>Spot Gold: In the spot gold black market last week, trading opened at 1.79 million yuan. Due to tight credit and many selling to exit their positions, it fell to a low of 1.76 million yuan this week. On Tuesday, it hovered around 1.80 million yuan. On Wednesday, as gold prices in other cities rose, actual sales increased sharply, and the market became firm. Although there was peace news on Friday, some people still viewed gold and banknotes favorably and bought at low prices. Moreover, the rise in US dollars indirectly boosted buying interest, and it once rose to 1.87 million yuan, the highest price this week. The closing price on Saturday was 1.84 million yuan, an increase of 45,000 yuan compared to last weekend.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency: The US dollar fluctuated with gold prices. On Monday, the market was mediocre, and a low price of 2.320 yuan was seen, the lowest price this week. From Tuesday to Thursday, it hovered between 2.330 and 2.340 yuan. On Friday, after foreign exchange experienced restrictions, settlements became frequent, and it rose to 2.500 yuan. Saturday's price of 2.520 yuan was the highest this week. The closing price on Saturday was 2.470 yuan, an increase of 140 yuan compared to last weekend.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks: Although there was news of the resumption of securities trading at the beginning of the week, it re-entered a weak phase due to the tightening of credit. Because it was the Dragon Boat Festival on Tuesday, the market was very quiet. Unpopular stocks suddenly gained favor due to the impending resumption of securities trading, and all rose. On Wednesday, after the festival, credit gradually eased, and unpopular stocks such as Xinnuo Yarn Factory, Dazhong Zhang Match Factory, and Zhongkuang Yarn Factory continued to rise due to rumors of capital increases and bonus shares. Popular stocks also revolved and trended higher. Because of short covering at the close, they became even stronger. On Thursday, the two major popular stocks had already been bid up high, and the upward momentum slowed. The three minor popular stocks absorbed more and rose more. Unpopular stocks also increased in price. At the close, many selling to take profits, resulting in a slight decline. In the end, the entire market squeezed shorts. On Friday, popular stocks were initially stable, and unpopular stocks continued to be strong. Later, many sold to take profits, and all declined. On Saturday, the range of ups and downs throughout the day was extremely narrow, and trading was relatively thin. As a result, there were slight differences compared to yesterday.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks: At the beginning of the week, the market was quite encouraged by rumors of the impending resumption of securities trading. Later, many sold at high prices, resulting in a slight decline. On Tuesday, the market was weak, trading was thin, and prices softened. On Wednesday, it initially showed a declining trend, but then many parties took the opportunity to be active and gradually rebounded. As a result, all saw increases except for Jardine Matheson. On Thursday, the opening was quite firm, but the market was suppressed by many competing to sell, and the closing was still stable. On Friday, it turned weak. On Saturday, the market was quiet, and all fell slightly compared to yesterday except for Ewo Brewery.</p>
<p>Rice: Last week, the source of rice increased, and the market gradually softened. From Monday to Friday, it fell all the way. Flour was also affected by rice prices and declined. Miscellaneous grains generally rose, but broad beans fell sharply. The supply of cooking oil was smooth, and prices continued to fall. The sugar market was stable, but medium sugar arrivals were strong and continued downstream. On Saturday, rice prices recovered after a continuous decline, and prices all rebounded. Flour and miscellaneous grains also became popular. Wheat and raw peanuts were weak. The cooking oil market turned firm, and sugar was stable.</p>
<p>Silk: This year's silkworm news is not good, and the cost of raising silkworms is high. The price of local silk rose instead of falling after the arrival of new silk. Therefore, Shanghai's thousand-strand silk was favored because of its low price. Last week, the price of thousand-strand silk also followed suit, rising by a total of more than 150,000 yuan. Factory silk remained stable during the week, with little change. High uniformity was also stable.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk: Last week, the asking price for 120 Denier Tianqiao Yuguang spot goods was generally between 1.3 million and 1.323 million yuan. The ups and downs of 120 Denier Beauty were around 1.18 million to 1.2 million yuan. The ups and downs of 75 Denier Golden Rooster Pingguang were generally between 1.38 million and 1.394 million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics: The price is increasing day by day, because wages have increased, and costs have risen. Moreover, there is a shortage of spot goods, and the balance between supply and demand is lost. Therefore, prices have soared. American-made bedspreads are 150,000 to 160,000 yuan per hundred, Dacheng plaid fabrics are 600 to 700 yuan, and Sheng Hang goods are also rising.</p>
<p>Yarn: Last week, the initial opening was weak, but the situation was still stable, resulting in an abundant supply of chips on the market. However, the actual sales of major customer groups such as Tianjin and Guangdong did not develop much. Holders of long positions in 42-count Blue Phoenix, Water Moon, Baoguang, and other popular thin yarns were uneasy and panicked from time to time, and continuously sold at a discount in the market, and market prices declined day by day. In particular, the decline of 42-count was the most severe. The highest price of 42-count Blue Phoenix on Monday was 2.49 million yuan, and the lowest price of 10-count Great Wall on Friday was 810,000 yuan. The difference between the highest and lowest prices during the process was as much as 1.68 million yuan. In terms of count, the three brands of 42-count Baoguang, Blue Phoenix, and Water Moon fell sharply by 330,000 to 440,000 yuan compared to the previous week. 40-count Blue Phoenix fell by 160,000 yuan, 20-count Special Double Horse fell by 70,000 yuan, 16-count Guangming fell by 50,000 yuan, and 10-count Boy Scouts fell by only 20,000 yuan. This reporter pointed out in the previous week that the difference between the prices of coarse and fine yarns might be squeezed, and this has now been clarified.</p>
<p>Cloth Market: The trend during the week was still stable. Customer groups and stores had a unique demand for peach blossom girl, transportation map, and socialite Shilin cloth because of their low prices, so the situation was more popular. Prices increased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan compared to the previous week. In addition, the market for various machine-made cloths was ordinary due to the impact of foreign goods, but it was better than the yarn market.</p>
<p>Cotton Market: During the week, Textile Construction Company and Yuxin and other factories were all watching and did not hear of purchases. In addition, private yarn factories such as Jiafeng, Sulun, Zhenxin, Minfeng, Qingfeng, Fuxin, and Lisheng all made sporadic purchases, so the market situation was stable. Prices increased by about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Overseas New York American cotton futures and spot goods all rose by 28 to 35 points.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Grain Arrives in Hubei for Disaster Relief in Hunan and Hubei</h3>
<p>[Hankou News] The Ministry of Food still has 1 million dan of surplus grain purchased in Sichuan, which has been ordered to be transported to relieve the disasters in Hunan and Hubei. The transportation started on May 15, and about 10,000 tons are transported each month. The Minsheng Company accounts for 90% of the ships participating in the transportation. Currently, the first batch of grain transported by the company, totaling more than 3,000 tons, has arrived in Yichang, and more than 700 tons have arrived in Hankou. A portion has also been transported to Beijing, about 300 tons.</p>
<h3>British Ship Arrives with a Large Batch of Banknotes, a Total of 629 Crates</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The British ship Gleniffer, managed by Jardine Matheson's Foreign Department, is coming from Europe to China and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today (the 10th).

<p>Industrial Survey</p>
<h3>The Calamity of Rosin</h3>
<p>— Zhang Boan</p>
<p>Rosin is a product abundantly produced in the mountainous areas of our country. In the southeast, such as Lilong in Zhejiang, Wule in Lai, Xiqiu in Anhui, and Jianshao in Fujian, there are large quantities produced. Although there are no statistics, I believe the number is very large. During the war, rosin was one of the military supplies and was prohibited from being exported and isolated from the occupied areas. Therefore, beeswax and rosin are known as the "yellow tigers." During the war, some people inserted rosin and beeswax into the bellies of live pigs and flowed into the occupied areas to gain huge profits. This shows the importance of this item.</p>
<p>In recent years, the stagnation of rosin in mountainous areas is ubiquitous. In addition, forests have grown taller in the past eight years, and rosin production has also increased. When the author traveled through the mountainous areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Anhui during the war, he saw countless mountain farmers storing rosin. At that time, many chemical engineering colleagues used rosin to manufacture liquid fuels, but the experimental results could only be used as diesel oil. As for volatile oils, because the carbon content and colloids were too heavy, the fuel would not burn completely once it entered the cylinder. As a result, the return valve often got stuck in the valve seat, and the pressure in the cylinder was very high, and the carbonaceous colloids on the valve seat were not easy to clean. However, the results were better in two-stroke diesel engines because there were no valves and it was a hot engine.</p>
<p>The author once used soft rosin and added 8% lime to make soap, which was dried to obtain fluorescent aromatic hydrocarbons. The fragrance was exactly the same as benzoin oil. The distillation rate of the oil reached 68% of the original rosin, the water content was 5%, and the remainder was the loss in soap making and coke. It can be seen that rosin distilled oil is indeed an important fragrance.</p>
<p>In terms of industrial use, rosin is mostly used for papermaking, a small amount for soap making, and the next is rosin products.</p>
<p>Rosin does not necessarily need to be refined for papermaking, but most other uses must be refined before it can be used. The operation of refining rosin is very simple. Although the equipment is simple or complex, the production is simple. Rosin is called raw rosin before it is refined, which is what people in the industry call "raw goods." Raw rosin is made in a copper distiller to distill out turpentine oil. The rosin is released from the still and becomes a transparent and clean block. American N rosin is the most transparent. The transparency of Wenzhou first-water rosin is not as good as N rosin. After the turpentine oil and some of the fusel oil are extracted, there are no problems in industrial applications. Raw rosin cannot be used in industry because one is that there are too many slag scraps, and the other is that it contains turpentine oil and fusel oil, so it must be distilled before it can be used. The refined rosin industry in Shanghai was not developed in the past, with only two or three small factories. Their products could still compete with foreign goods, because foreign goods were valuable. Although the quality of domestic goods was slightly worse, they could still be used, and the value difference was more than double. Therefore, foreign rosin has never been able to develop.</p>
<p>In terms of quality, the difference in refining technology is small. The biggest reason is entirely due to the poor harvesting method. According to research, if raw goods are harvested according to scientific methods and distilled immediately after harvesting, they can be as transparent and bright yellow as American N rosin. This is because of oxidation.</p>
<p>However, it is currently impossible for those who produce rosin in the mountainous areas of our country to harvest scientifically. Mountain farmers do not have enough capital to improve harvesting, and they cannot set up factories for manufacturing locally, so it is still difficult to improve quality.</p>
<p>Moreover, the market changes of rosin in Shanghai change several times a day, and it is difficult for mountain manufacturing to be flexible. If manufacturers go to the mountains to manufacture, mountain farmers will raise the price of their goods. If mountain merchants transport them to Shanghai for sale, they can manipulate the raw material prices. Therefore, rosin manufacturers would rather suspend production when they lack raw materials than purchase from the producing areas. The reason lies in this. Currently, rosin refining plants in Shanghai are operating in a very flexible way. On the one hand, they sell raw goods from mountain merchants to users and pay the user's money to the mountain merchants. In a blink of an eye, they can make a huge profit. Why bother going to the mountains to purchase?</p>
<p>The current price of raw rosin in Shanghai is 18,000 to 19,000 yuan per dan, and the price of refined rosin is 35,000 to 36,000 yuan per dan (the price of American N rosin is 95,000 yuan per dan, which is only 60% of the price of domestic rosin). If we compare the cost of mountain farmers with the profits of manufacturers, we can get the following results:</p>
<p>(1) Cost of mountain farmers: Daily harvesting of one dan of rosin, wages of 3,000 yuan, picking and mountain rent of 3,500 yuan, the purchase price in the producing area is 8,000 to 10,000 yuan per dan, mountain farmers barely earn the wage cost.</p>
<p>(2) Transportation from the producing area to Shanghai, the freight per dan is up to 15,000 yuan and a minimum of 10,000 yuan. Transportation merchants: The loss is 15,000 to 5,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>(3) Manufacturing manufacturers, the purchase price of raw materials is 20,000 yuan per dan, 3 to 5 pounds of turpentine oil are produced, 3,000 yuan per pound, and 90 jin of refined rosin is worth 31,500 yuan. In addition to wages and interest expenses, a gross profit of one to one and a half times can be obtained.</p>
<p>According to this, mountain farmers only earn wages, and give away rosin for nothing. Transportation merchants are unlucky and lose their capital. Manufacturers seem to be reaping the benefits, but they are not. First, a small rosin manufacturing plant, not counting its housing, etc., just the equipment cost alone, also costs tens of millions. Adding the cost of housing and so on, it costs a large amount of capital! Second, the rosin business is only for six months a year, and the other six months are spent eating the profits.</p>
<p>Our country's rosin production is so large, and its industrial use is so small. In fact, the only way is to improve quality and export it in large quantities.</p>
<p>Production and Construction Special Issue</p>
<h3>Provincial Governments Should Quickly Establish Entomology Bureaus</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yao</p>
<p>The arduous eight-year war of resistance has ended. Scars are everywhere, and a hundred policies await implementation. Future work should prioritize post-war recovery and reconstruction. The wise see wisdom, and the benevolent see benevolence. People from all walks of life have discussed this extensively. I believe that agricultural recovery is the most urgent task. I will explain my reasons and welcome insightful critique.</p>
<p>(1) The recovered areas have been ravaged by the enemy for many years, exploited and plundered, leaving rural areas impoverished and production low, with empty treasuries. Even the provinces in the rear have suffered from droughts and insect infestations in recent years, resulting in poor autumn harvests and little surplus. Normally, our country's rice and wheat production is already insufficient at just over 20 million dan. Post-war food shortages are even more severe (news reports indicate widespread starvation, which is appalling). Importing foreign grain is merely a stopgap measure and a great shame for our ancient agricultural nation. Therefore, we must seek fundamental solutions to increase food production to plug the leaks and strengthen the foundation of our country. Preventing and controlling pests to reduce losses is the quickest and most effective fundamental method, as the saying goes, "Seven-tenths depends on insect control, and three-tenths on the seed."</p>
<p>In recent years, Henan has suffered from severe locust plagues, which have spread to Shaanxi. The full extent of the damage is still unknown. In the past, control was impossible due to the proximity of the front lines. It is likely that many eggs were laid, which is a major concern. If locusts ravage again this year, it will inevitably lead to complete crop failure. A major disaster will lead to widespread poverty. Other provinces and cities that have suffered from insect infestations will likely face similar situations. Prevention is essential, and establishing an entomology bureau is extremely urgent.</p>
<p>(2) Chinese farmers primarily consume grains, with very few vegetables and fruits. Grains lack essential iron and vitamins, leading to poor health and development. The nutrition of the people was even worse during the war. In the future, we must improve national nutrition and living standards. In addition to staple grains, we must increase the production of supplementary foods such as vegetables and fruits. However, horticultural plants like vegetables and fruits are extremely vulnerable to insect damage. Therefore, preventing and controlling pests is the primary task for increasing production.</p>
<p>(3) Cotton is a major agricultural product, but our country is still unable to achieve self-sufficiency. Before the war, we imported over 10 million dan annually, while losses due to insect pests were about 9.4 million dan per year. It is shameful for an agricultural country to rely on other nations for its clothing needs. Furthermore, cotton is a raw material for gunpowder and is critical for national defense. Victory in war depends on peacetime preparations. Therefore, all countries in the world, in addition to strengthening their military and weapons, make every effort to prepare materials. How should our country pay attention to the prevention and control of cotton pests to increase cotton production in the future?</p>
<p>(4) Silk, tea, and tung oil have been our country's major exports for many years, generating substantial foreign exchange earnings. At the beginning of national reconstruction, the population and resources are greater than in the past. Exports must be doubled to offset the increase in imports. Therefore, it is imperative to increase the production of silk, tea, and tung oil. The government has recently paid attention to this, as evidenced by the establishment of the China Silk Company. Its intention is good, no doubt. However, its implementation plan has not yet been heard. The most critical issue is how to reduce the production costs of raw silk, tea, and tung oil. Solving this problem requires improving production technology and controlling insect pests.</p>
<p>(5) After the war, there will inevitably be plagues. History, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, shows this to be true. The war has caused countless casualties. The number of compatriots killed or injured on the front lines and in the rear has reached 20 million. Millions of enemy soldiers have died on our land. Bloodshed is everywhere, and corpses litter the ground. The outbreak of epidemics is foreseeable, and their transmission is largely due to insects as vectors. Therefore, killing mosquitoes, flies, fleas, and other insects to prevent the spread of epidemics is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>(6) Post-war transportation will prioritize airplanes. Distances of thousands of miles will be as close as neighbors, reached in an instant. The import of plant seedlings and seeds from foreign countries or other provinces will be extremely easy. At the same time, the chances of introducing foreign or other provincial pests will also be high. In their native habitats, pests are controlled by natural enemies, so their harm is not obvious. Once they reach a new environment without natural enemies, they will inevitably cause enormous disasters. Therefore, customs posts throughout the country must have dedicated personnel to conduct inspections and devise countermeasures.</p>
<p>(7) After military demobilization, it is inevitable that soldiers will be moved to cultivate wasteland. However, the wasteland is overgrown with weeds and teeming with insects. Once these are cleared, the insects will be forced to starve. They will then attack the crops in the reclaimed areas. Due to the disruption of "natural balance," pest problems will arise. Therefore, pest problems in border provinces should be given equal importance as land reclamation.</p>
<p>(8) In the past, our country purchased most insecticides and pest control equipment from foreign countries, which was also a drain on our resources. In fact, many plants with insecticidal properties and indigenous pest control methods are quite effective throughout the country. However, these all require specialists to conduct scientific experiments and research, to improve and promote them. At the very least, we should use them to control various beneficial insects that control pests. These also need to be studied and utilized. In recent years, new foreign insecticides, such as DDT, have been constantly emerging. We must intensify our research and catch up quickly.</p>
<p>In summary, post-war reconstruction includes important measures such as increasing the production of food, supplementary foods, clothing raw materials, recovering foreign exchange, ensuring the safety and promoting the health of the people, and raising the international academic standing. All of these are related to entomological research and the establishment of entomology bureaus. It is hoped that administrative offices in various provinces and prominent figures will pay attention to this and quickly establish entomology bureaus to benefit the common people.</p>
<h3>The Meaning of Standardization</h3>
<p>— Yang Yang</p>
<p>Some attribute the successful conclusion of this war to the massive material support from the United States, which rightfully earned the reputation of being the "world's arsenal." If we consider that before the Pearl Harbor attack, American production was not even on par with Japan's, how could it assume the heavy responsibility of being the "world's arsenal" a few years later? Strictly speaking, we should attribute this to the promotion of standardization in the United States during peacetime. Of course, we cannot ignore other factors such as advanced technology, abundant raw materials, and sufficient equipment, but we believe that standardization is the fundamental and most important factor.</p>
<p>The Chinese standardization movement was promoted once by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing in the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943] during an exhibition of products from its affiliated factories and mines. At that time, it did not receive any significant response, and now it seems like "bygones."</p>
<p>Now, there is widespread discussion of industrialization in China. If we pay due attention to American production and the Soviet Union's first, second, and third five-year plans (the Soviet Union is now promoting its fourth five-year plan), our discussion of standardization is not meaningless.</p>
<p>Standardization is the adoption or establishment of rules or demonstrations to reduce actions related to things, that is, to prescribe standards to increase output and reduce production costs as the main methods.</p>
<p>Ordinary standardization can be divided into (1) product standardization, (2) raw material standardization, (3) tool standardization, (4) labor standardization, (5) action standardization, (6) process standardization. General specialized manufacturing is product standardization. The so-called raw material standardization does not necessarily require the use of the best raw materials, but rather the specific quality raw materials that meet special purposes. Once selected, they are designated as standard. Labor standardization is the center of labor management and manufacturing management. There are two basic methods: time study and motion study, which we are familiar with. However, mentioning time study and motion study often meets with opposition from workers. We can emulate the Soviet Union's first and second five-year plans, promoting the Stakhanovite movement, where workers consciously and automatically undertake their tasks. Because China does not yet have labor-capital antagonism, at most there are only a few illegal officials and unscrupulous merchants with improper and abnormal wealth. At the same time, Chinese industry is still in its infancy and needs to be nurtured. If we can make workers understand this, I believe cooperation is possible.</p>
<p>Prescribing standards usually involves the following three steps: First, study various methods and their effects (investigation), then transform complexity into simplicity and select the best method or sample (simplification), and finally prescribe the best method for permanent imitation (standardization).</p>
<p>Common objections to standardization include: (1) promoting worker mechanization, (2) destroying manufacturing secrets, (3) hindering industrial progress, and (4) crushing individuality and inventive interest. Based on the facts of today's production industry in the United States, the latter three reasons are untenable. But this is also [missing character] and there are ways to remedy this. At the same time, weighing the contribution of standardization on the one hand, and its advantages and disadvantages on the other, we can easily distinguish between them. Standardization contributes to production in the following ways: (1) facilitating mass production, (2) increasing productivity, (3) reducing production costs, (4) improving quality and increasing opportunities for improvement. For society: (1) reducing production costs, thereby reducing consumer living expenses and raising living standards, (2) reducing unemployment, increasing wages, eliminating industrial unrest and conflict, and reducing business fluctuations, enabling balanced economic development.</p>
<h3>Save the Poor Tea Farmers</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhigang</p>
<p>Tea is one of China's special products. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, it has been traded with foreign countries and exchanged for horses with border regions, possessing immense value in military and political affairs. According to the customs statistics report of 1872, the export volume reached more than two million dan, totaling 44,795,166 taels of customs silver, almost monopolizing the entire world tea market. After 1920, it declined to 400,000 dan. The tragic state of the export of Chinese tea has reached an extreme point.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the first wartime industry control on June 7, 1938, to develop foreign trade. The market was concentrated in Hong Kong, so in 1938 and 1939, not only did the export volume exceed that of previous years by a large margin, but the market price of tea also increased significantly, and the lives of tea farmers improved. After 1940, the seaports were blockaded, and the lives of tea farmers were extremely difficult.</p>
<p>With the victory of the War of Resistance, everyone hoped that the export of Chinese tea would develop greatly. Tea farmers returned to their hometowns one after another to reorganize their tea gardens, and tea merchants also prepared to export.</p>
<p>Today, the tea season has arrived, but the market price of tea is deteriorating. According to the price report released by the Washington Price Bureau on April 2, Keemun black tea should not exceed 42 cents per pound, and green tea should not exceed 48 cents per pound. Converted into national currency, the highest price per dan is only about 90,000 yuan, and it must be delivered in New York.</p>
<p>But what is the cost of our tea farmers? Please see the cost of raw tea in the Pingshui tea area below:</p>
<p>Appendix</p>
<p>Cost Item Amount Explanation</p>
<p>Picking wages 20,000 Each dan of raw tea requires 400 catties of green leaves, each catty costs 50 yuan in wages.</p>
<p>Same as above</p>
<p>Initial processing wages 7,500 Each dan of raw tea requires 5 workers, each worker is paid 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Fuel and charcoal cost 2,400 Each dan of raw tea requires 400 catties of fuel and charcoal, each dan is calculated at 600 yuan.</p>
<p>Food cost 18,000 Each dan of raw tea requires 30 workers for picking and processing, each person is calculated at 600 yuan.</p>
<p>Oil lamp cost 1,200 Each dan of raw tea requires 2 catties of green oil, each catty is calculated at 600 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous labor cost 1,200 Each dan of raw tea from the place of origin to the tea hall and other miscellaneous labor adds up to one worker.</p>
<p>Management fee 12,000 On average, each two mu produces one dan of raw tea, requiring a total of ten workers for cultivation and weeding.</p>
<p>Each worker is calculated at 1,200 yuan.</p>
<p>Land rent fee 12,000 General tea farmers are tenants, producing one dan of raw tea with 1.5 given to the landlord.</p>
<p>Tool cost 80,000 yuan</p>
<p>Adding the costs of the tea factory's concentration, refining, packaging, transportation, and losses, the cost is at least more than 100,000 yuan per dan. How can export trade develop like this?</p>
<p>Earning foreign exchange to purchase national construction materials is an urgent policy for the future. But what is the reality now? Imports are more than exports. The poor tea farmers, the end is coming again. Wise authorities, quickly think of a way to save them, to develop trade with the tea farms. Otherwise, this time next year, I am afraid that tea farmers and tea merchants will disappear from this earth. "Tea is a unique product of our country" may become a historical name.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Business Management</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>The following issues need to be discussed in terms of production organizations: (1) factory buildings, (2) personnel, (3) raw materials, (4) manufacturing, (5) transportation. If these issues can be handled in accordance with scientific principles, the chances of success will increase.</p>
<p>(1) Factory Buildings</p>
<p>A. Factory Location</p>
<p>The situation of old factories: Many prosperous factories, upon careful investigation, seem to have not undergone detailed consideration. These factories are often started by one or two people, or even one person, near their homes. The scale at the beginning is very small, but after hard work and management, its scope gradually expands. In addition to the expenses required for daily life, the organizers put the money earned over the years into the business, and the factory buildings are gradually added. However, to meet the economic standards, the construction of factory buildings must adopt low-cost methods or materials. When their business develops rapidly, they can build new factory buildings, but sometimes because the old factory building is the place of origin, they are unwilling to demolish it, so they try to preserve it. These factory buildings, which are added at any time, are often unable to connect with each other because of different construction years and construction methods, which is very inconvenient for the progress of affairs. If it is designed and built completely new factory buildings, then there are many places that should be eliminated, but to preserve the inherent factory buildings, you have to compromise a little. So the only shortcoming of using old factory buildings is that the progress of affairs is not very convenient, and it will be difficult to implement scientific management.</p>
<p>New factory buildings: A person who can create a completely new factory building is relatively lucky, because he can be free from the limitations of customs and can design everything completely according to the needs of the time. However, he must pay extra attention to his work, because there is no old factory for reference, and everything belongs to creation.</p>
<p>Several issues that must be considered when choosing a location for building a factory</p>
<p>(1) The distance between raw materials and sales: The location of a factory is best able to make the distance from raw materials to transportation as short as possible. For example, a factory is located near a railway or waterway, making transportation very convenient, then it is extremely convenient for sales.</p>
<p>For example, for the sake of manufacturing convenience, the location of a canned food factory is best close to the production areas of raw materials such as vegetables, chickens, ducks, and fresh fruits. But it does not have to be close to the tin can manufacturing factory, because a tin can manufacturing factory often has to supply many canned food factories, and the transportation of tin cans is more convenient than vegetables, fresh fruits, chickens, ducks, fish, meat, etc. Because the location of the factory building is suitable, not only is it more convenient to purchase raw materials, but the money saved in a year is also very considerable.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most ideal thing is that the location of a factory building is very close to the raw materials and also very close to the place of transportation.</p>
<p>(2) Consideration of labor issues: It is impossible to establish a manufacturing factory without labor. Labor is the producer of the manufacturing factory. Therefore, when establishing a factory building, the source of labor is also worth considering. If it is a very large-scale manufacturing factory, then this problem is relatively easy to solve, because you can build a town yourself, so that the workers of the factory live in it, and at the same time, you can also hold many welfare undertakings for the workers. This method is very common in foreign countries, but very rare in China. The former Kangyuan Can Factory provided accommodation for workers and was very effective in accordance with the principles of scientific management.</p>
<p>If it is a manufacturing factory that is not very large in scale, then the source of labor is worth considering when selecting a location.</p>

<h3>A Departing Look from a Prominent Industrialist in Yunnan: Suggestions for Yunnan's Industrialization</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zhang Shengli</p>
<p>Kunming Air Dispatch from This Newspaper, May 22</p>
<p>The post-war repatriation wave has taken away Yunnan's wealth and its talent. During the War of Resistance, Yunnan was not only a concentration of wealth nationwide, but also a concentration of talent. The large amount of wealth made Yunnan increasingly prosperous, and the large number of talented people laid the foundation for Yunnan's current industrial construction. Although it has only been eight years, the effect has been extremely significant. People often feel fortunate for Yunnan. But from the beginning of repatriation to now, eight months of repatriation work has defeated the hard-earned achievements of the past eight years. Not only Yunnanese are saddened by this, but many people who participated in the construction of Yunnan also deeply regret it.</p>
<h3>Talent Outflow, Fleeing Capital</h3>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, people from other provinces living in Yunnan returned to their hometowns one after another, and part of the capital naturally transferred with them. This matter is beyond reproach. However, in recent months, floating capital from the province's industrial and commercial circles has also been transferred to various places in Beijing and Shanghai to seek high profits. As a result, the money market has become tighter day by day, and industry and commerce have become increasingly depressed. The magic hand of speculation has controlled half of the market, and the psychology of disappointment and waiting has filled the entire industrial sector. This is one of the biggest crises in the current construction.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance, the value of gold, foreign currency, and cloth in the hands of speculators was discounted by a few points, but at least some people could still be called "rich in copper mountains" at that time. They even used the relationship between public opinion and popular opinion to loudly appeal for help every day. Looking at the situation, it seems like stranded fish that cannot last a day. At that time, apart from the Yunnan Branch of the Industrial Association, few people noticed the crisis of industrial expansion in Yunnan. Although the association repeatedly requested assistance to various factories and mines, the loans obtained were still very small. The simplest reason is that there are many speculators, and the cries for help are louder and more powerful. There are few people in the province who are doing practical work in the industrial and mining industry, and they lack confidence and perseverance. Therefore, when survival is at stake, they feel even more helpless.</p>
<p>Yunnan's provincial-run industrial and mining industries originally had two largest systems, one was the Yunnan Enterprise Bureau and the other was the Yunnan Economic Commission. In terms of wealth, it can be called the best in any province. In terms of organization, it is also extremely large. In terms of foundation, they are all equal opportunities. However, since the victory of the War of Resistance, the affiliated units have either been closed down one after another, or only a breath remains. The reason is mostly due to the lack of personnel. In the past six months, these one or two units have been undergoing reorganization and merging to establish the Yunnan People's Enterprise Company, hoping to unify and localize it. Under the principle of distinguishing between public and private, wealth can be maintained and developed. The law is good and the intention is beautiful, but it is still difficult to produce due to personnel relations.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, state-run industrial and mining industries in Yunnan were extremely prosperous for a time. The factories and mines under the National Resources Commission reached more than ten units, including the Central Machine Factory, the Central Electrical Equipment Factory, and the Central Radio Factory, all of which were very large in scale. If general speculative tycoons can transfer their assets as much as possible and develop the province's large and small industrial and mining industries with the determination to ask less about returns, it is a good opportunity that is hard to come by. In the past eight years, some people with foresight in the province have repeatedly called for this matter, but the effect has not been significant. After the victory of the War of Resistance, state-run factories and mines were either closed due to repatriation, or shrunk due to the inability to maintain them. Few remain to this day. This has lost a major boost to the province's future industrial construction.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, many industrial talents from all over the country were concentrated in this province. After the victory of the War of Resistance, repatriation and receiving work urgently needed to be carried out, so they left Yunnan one after another. This is also a major loss to the province's industrial construction intelligence. Of course, there is no shortage of outstanding people in the province's industrial circles, but it is deeply felt that there is not enough talent to engage in large-scale construction, or even maintain the foundation of the wartime period.</p>
<h3>Industrial Magnate Initiates Planning</h3>
<p>The dispersal of talent, the flight of capital, the stagnation of provincial and private industrial and mining enterprises, and the relocation of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises – these facts, on the one hand, have exacerbated the difficulties in reviving Yunnan's industrial and mining sector, and on the other hand, have made us feel that the work of revival is urgently needed. The reporter has visited industrial magnates in this province for this matter, collected relevant information, and sought their insightful opinions. After more than two months, I finally learned about a portion of their detailed and practical preliminary recommendations. However, among the industrial construction projects in various provinces, those that have already started this planning work are still rare.</p>
<p>The Southern Branch of the National Industrial Association organized the "Yunnan Industrial Revitalization Planning Committee" three months ago, mutually electing Zhou Ren as chairman and Fang Gang as vice-chairman. The members included Lin Fengqi, Guo Zhu, Gui Naihuang, Zhu Jianfei, and Lian Zhongjing. The committee spent more than two months from collective discussions, soliciting opinions, collecting materials, to drafting the plan, finally completing the article "Suggestions for the Industrialization of Yunnan". It is now scheduled to be submitted to the central ministries and departments and relevant departments in this province this month, requesting their adoption and implementation. These seven drafters of the plan are all people from outside the province who have made significant contributions to Yunnan's industrial and mining construction during the Anti-Japanese War. They deeply understand Yunnan's economic environment and resources, recognize the possibility and necessity of Yunnan's industrialization, and have witnessed the development process of Yunnan's industrial and mining industry, from its inception to its growth to its decline, sharing both joy and anxiety. They love Yunnan and cherish the fruits they co-created with the people of Yunnan. The current work of revitalization is about to begin actively. Before leaving Yunnan, they never forgot the industrialization of Yunnan, hence the drafting of the above plan. Some say this is a parting glance, while others say it is an expression of effort, but in today's Great Rear Area, how many such glances are there?</p>
<p>Speaking of Yunnan's natural environment and economic resources, they are truly rare among all provinces in the country. The entire province of Yunnan has vast land, a mild climate, lush forests and livestock, and abundant mineral deposits. Its economic conditions can be described as naturally blessed. If people can give their best, resources are fully utilized, and land is fully developed, then in a few decades, it can rival the Northeast. Moreover, currently, the situation outside the customs is uncertain, the Central Plains are plagued by disasters, and along the Yangtze River and the coast, either the vitality has been greatly lost or the remnants of the aftermath of the disaster remain. There is no time to save people from iron and rescue them from disaster, let alone large-scale industrial construction. The development of industry and mining in Yunnan Province is not only less difficult, but also cannot be ignored in future national defense. Therefore, in the entire nation-building process, the industrial construction of Yunnan should be regarded as a major and urgent part.</p>
<p>Regarding the steps of Yunnan's industrialization, according to the suggestions of Zhou Ren, Fang Gang, Lin Fengqi, Zhu Jianfei, Guo Zhu, Gui Naihuang, and Lian Zhongjing, they are divided into the following four items:</p>
<h3>Transportation Construction Advances on Land and in the Air</h3>
<p>(1) Aviation Construction: Before the railway can be fully utilized, make full use of existing airfields and build airfields with economic value in important areas to make air transport within the province accessible to all regions, so as to obtain important materials and construction equipment.</p>
<p>(2) Railway Construction: The goal should be to assist the development of the steel industry. The first step is to build the Kunming to Yipinglang main line, about 120 kilometers, with Anning as the center, the Yipinglang coal mine branch line, about 20 kilometers, the Lufeng to Dashanya iron mine branch line, about 15 kilometers, the Caopu to Anning Wangjiatang iron mine branch line, about 10 kilometers, and the Kebao Village coal mine branch line, about 25 kilometers. The second step is to lay important main lines and supplement coal and metal mine branch lines, completing the Xukun Railway, about 700 kilometers, the Shifo Railway, about 400 kilometers, the Yimen iron mine branch line, about 40 kilometers, and the Huize copper mine branch line, about 100 kilometers. The third step is to lay other important main lines and important mining area branch lines, including the Yunnan-Burma, Yunnan-Xikang, Yunnan-Guizhou, and Yunnan-Guangxi four lines, and important mining area branch lines along the main lines.</p>
<h3>Steel Construction Completed in Phases</h3>
<p>The first step of railway construction is to build about 100 kilometers of main lines and 90 kilometers of branch lines. In addition to 8,500 steel rails, about 8,500 tons, which must be ordered from overseas, the remaining 35-pound light rails, about 3,200 tons, main frame steel sleepers, fishplates, buckles, etc., about 8,000 tons, can all be made locally. The second step is 1,100 kilometers of main lines and 140 kilometers of branch lines, requiring 100,000 tons of steel rails, 90,000 tons of auxiliary steel, and 50,000 tons of steel for transportation equipment and various industries, totaling about 250,000 tons of steel. First, start with an annual output of 5,000 tons, and gradually expand to an annual output of 70,000 tons, to be completed within five years. Then, use five years to complete the third step of railway construction. To meet the above needs, in terms of steel, the existing steel plants and machinery should be reorganized and concentrated, and unified organization should be established to start production as soon as possible. In addition, it is necessary to add two 150-ton cupolas, five 10-ton Bessemer steelmaking converters, two 3-ton electric furnaces, two 6-ton electric furnaces, and one 1-ton high-frequency electric furnace. Expand coal and iron ore mining equipment. Build byproduct coking plants, refractory material plants, iron slag cement plants, large rail rolling mills, steelmaking workshops, steel plate and pipe plants, and iron car factories.</p>
<h3>Power Construction Plant Establishment Work</h3>
<p>The major rivers in Yunnan Province have rapid currents, and there are places where hydropower can be developed everywhere. In order to cooperate with the construction of projects A and B and supply industries that can be developed as soon as possible, the order of power construction is as follows: (1) Langchuan Hydropower Plant: The river is about 94 kilometers long, with a water surface drop of 220 meters, and the water potential is 31,700 horsepower. If Dianchi Lake is used as a regulating reservoir, its water potential can be increased to 136,500 horsepower. Except for the Dazhuang section, which has been utilized by Yaolong Company for part of it, the downstream Caijiacun Shilouti section has a drop of 70 meters within 5 kilometers. Once Dianchi Lake is reorganized and regulated, the total power generation of this section can reach 30,000 kilowatts, so it can be developed in three parts. The first plant is located in Caijiacun, generating 6,000 kilowatts. The second plant is located in Shilouti, generating 20,000 kilowatts. The third plant is located 2 kilometers downstream of Shilouti, generating 4,000 kilowatts. Among the above power generation, 20,000 kilowatts are used for the steel industry, and 10,000 kilowatts are used for other industries. (2) Bapanjiang Waterfall: There is a large waterfall of 90 meters in that place. Within 1 kilometer from the large waterfall to the small waterfall, there is a drop of 120 meters, which can generate 8,000 kilowatts of electricity, and the project is extremely simple. If it forms an electrical grid with the Kunming plants, in addition to supplying power to Lunan, Xuanliang, and Chengjiang areas, it can also supplement the use of Kunming's industries. (3) Zhaotong Shaiyu River: Within 120 kilometers, there is a drop of 1,300 meters, among which the Shuiyan section has a drop of about 400 meters within 400 kilometers. The total power generation is about 30,000 kilowatts, and if a reservoir is built upstream, it may increase to 60,000 kilowatts. The power there can be transmitted to Zhaotong, Weining, and Huize, and that area is rich in coal, iron, copper, lead, and zinc. Relying on this power and cooperating with the transportation of the Xukun Railway, its economic value is very great. (2) Xier River power: From Heilongqiao in Xiaguan, flowing west less than 1 li, the flow is always rapid, and it is estimated that 20,000 kilowatts of electricity can be generated. In addition to supplying farmland irrigation to Fengyi, Binchuan, Eryuan, Dêngchuan, and Dali counties, it can also build the industrial center of western Yunnan.</p>
<h3>Other Industries Eight Departments</h3>
<p>(1) Machine Industry: With the cooperation of steel and cheap hydropower in this province, the development of large and small machine industries can be achieved reasonably. (2) Fertilizer and Match Raw Material Industry: The special phosphorus ore produced in this province is of excellent quality and rich in reserves, which is rare in China, and can be developed and manufactured in large quantities for domestic fertilizer and match raw materials. (3) Aluminum Smelting Industry: Kunming and Anning areas are rich in aluminum ore, and with the cooperation of hydropower, it should be a very promising industry. (4) Glass Industry: Excellent glass raw materials are produced near Kunming, which can be produced on a large scale. (5) Textile Industry: The kapok in southern Yunnan Province is of excellent quality and easy to promote. Cotton areas in the province are distributed in more than 80 counties. If promotion is actively carried out and pests are controlled, it is not difficult to be self-sufficient. (6) Chemical Industry: This province is rich in saltpeter and sulfur raw materials, which can be used for the development of the acid and alkali industry. (7) Paper Industry: There are many primitive forests in this province. Once transportation is convenient, the wood pulp raw materials will be inexhaustible. (8) Various Mining Industries: The tin in Tongjiu Mengzi area is the first producing area in the country. Copper ore is widely distributed, and there are more than 80 counties that have produced copper. The distribution of silver, lead, zinc, and iron is in more than 60 counties, and the hope is so great that it can crown the country. This province is naturally blessed with coal and iron ore raw materials. Although the reserves are slightly inferior to those in the Northeast, the quality can be called superior, which is sufficient to supply the needs of the southwestern provinces. The important producing areas of gold ore are in the Jinsha River, Lancang River, Red River, and Nujiang River basins, all of which can be mined in large quantities. As for the asbestos in Wuding and the mica in Lijiang, they are both important special products of this province.</p>
<h3>Five Proposals To Promote Their Realization</h3>
<p>Since the steps of Yunnan's industrialization are as described above, how to promote their realization? Here are five proposals:</p>
<p>(1) The government and the people should jointly organize a planning research committee to formulate an industrialization outline in the short term, and then draft specific implementation methods separately according to urgency and gradually implement them.</p>
<p>(2) For undertakings that are necessary for state-owned enterprises, the government should quickly organize them. Those that can be privately operated, or should be returned to private operation, should be actively encouraged by the government and vigorously guaranteed.</p>
<p>(3) A portion of the funds from the government's transportation development funds should be allocated to maintain the work of existing factories by placing orders.</p>
<p>(4) Implement a planned fund, which should be actively raised by the government through various methods such as fundraising, subsidies, loans, or issuing bonds, and strive to achieve results as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(5) In terms of tax revenue, the government should specially reduce or exempt import taxes, business taxes, and profit taxes for all private factories and mines that are handled in the industrialization plan, in order to show its advocacy, so that social idle funds can take the path of industry.</p>
<h3>Reader Opinions Guidelines</h3>
<p>(1) This column is absolutely open, and the authors are responsible for their own articles, but brevity is essential. (2) Do not attack private individuals, and do not submit one manuscript to two publications. (3) Contributors must indicate "Reader Opinions Manuscript" and must provide their real name and address, but a pseudonym may be used when publishing. (4) Manuscripts for this column will not be paid. (5) The newspaper reserves the right to edit manuscripts. (6) Whether a manuscript is published or not will not be answered by letter. (7) The newspaper may forward manuscripts to relevant authorities for reference when necessary.</p>
<h3>Questions about Studying Abroad Exams</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: At this time, when the leader indicates the beginning of nation-building and there is an urgent need to cultivate talent, I learned that our educational administrative authorities, because St. John's University has not yet been registered, do not allow our graduating students to register for the upcoming self-funded study abroad exam, which is shocking. I especially request a corner of your newspaper to state a few questions below, hoping that our educational authorities will explain them. (1) Many of our John's graduating students are government administrative officials, which shows that the government has actually recognized their academic status. Why doesn't the Ministry of Education recognize it? If the Ministry of Education does not recognize their academic status, then why not order them to stop operating, but still allow them to start school, causing innocent students to suffer? (2) A few months ago, the Ministry of Finance held an exam for senior financial personnel, and our John's students were also allowed to participate, and most were admitted, and now they are serving in various tax bureaus, which means that the Ministry of Finance has recognized their academic status. Why doesn't the Ministry of Education? (3) If the Ministry of Education wants to use this to make St. John's register, then the Ministry of Education can directly order the school authorities to comply. There is no need to sacrifice our innocent students. Moreover, our school is currently carrying out registration procedures. For the sake of cherishing youth, it should also be accommodated in theory. (4) Moreover, now that the Ministry of Education has adopted a self-funded study abroad management system, the purpose is to select real talents and eliminate unqualified people, so it is okay to allow them to participate in the exam, and the winners and losers will depend on their results. Moreover, in order to select real talents, the country has specially established a certification exam system for those who have no diploma but are determined to serve in public office. Moreover, our students have a diploma to prove their qualifications? Guangpei speaks above. June 3rd.</p>
