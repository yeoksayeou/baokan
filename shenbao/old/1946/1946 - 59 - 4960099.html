<h3>我國已表明基本立塲　東北陰霾可望開朗　軍事衝突嚴重性亦滅</h3>
<p>〔木報漢口廿七日電〕宋院長過漢時曾語人，東北問題不久當可解次，盼國人勿過憂慮。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕某有資格人士語記者，陰霾重重之東北天空，不久即有晴朗希望，雖蔣主席與魏德邁之會晤，艾森豪威爾之巡視太平洋岸，基倫將軍之來華與華北美陸戰隊司令洛基將軍珍珠港之行，皆倍增東北問題沉重之感，但以實際言之，目前情勢已較前略佳矣。（一）此問題相常公開後，中國之基本立塲與熊度，已更易爲蘇聯所認識，蔣經國携往莫斯科之最後方案，蘇聯可能相當重視。（二）最近簽字之整軍方案，其範圍包括及東北區，已使東北軍事衝突之嚴重性大爲减殺，並有獲得根本解決之可能。（三）東蒙代表團抵平後，雖其是否有國際或黨派背景，尙爲官方所懷疑，但彼等聲明，在中華民國以內求自治，已使官方初次所獲情報所帶來之颶風爲之稍見平息，因此，東北局勢已具有趨於明朗之希望。發言人並吿記者，日前尙有長春鐵路公司人員自渝飛平，今明兩日轉往長春，可證東北問題尙未惡化至去年十一月十七日之程度。張嘉璈短期即來平，傳達中央意旨，並轉往東北，官方人士均相信，張嘉璈北來，將象徵政府對東北有辦法，但亦有人謂：如東北惡化至必需二次長春撤退，張嘉璈仍將前往爲撤退主持人。</p>
<p>〔木報長春廿六日電〕東北問題現達極端重要階段，此雖純爲外交問題，然若干人士則常與內政混為一體，而此若干人士之行動，亦常以外交動態爲轉移，問題之複雜性在此，危險性亦在此。東北各地八路軍甚衆，中有一部係於最近數月間來自山東，餘大部均係就地編成，其勢力以東部爲最，長鐵沿綫亦有散布，由潘開大連之火車，離瀋十里外即有八路軍之關卡，檢查車中旅客。瀋陽·長春間車行至鐵嶺一帶，亦常遭檢查，長春·哈爾濱間之檢查站，則在德惠，彼等與蘇軍間之關係，表面似互不相擾，竟有時亦常遭蘇軍驅逐·以九台縣之接收爲例，該縣縣長喬桂芳首次前往接收時，當地八路軍與蘇軍雜處，蘇城防司令曾建議，由喬氏與八路軍談判，喬堅持須在蘇軍手中接收，以是無結果而回，殆再度接收時，蘇軍已先期令八路軍退出。八路軍縣長楊華雷留書喬氏謂，係依政協決議退讓，決非示弱，嗣喬於接收該縣營城子煤礦時，蘇軍司令且迫八路軍退出周圍五十公里以外，並以三月一日爲期，八路軍毫無異言，而獨於國軍推進時，則不惜拚死阻攔。現瀋陽西北法庫一帶戰事激烈，雙方均有傷亡。接收後農安縣亦曾一度發生遭遇戰，又凡八路軍所在之省縣，現均設立行政機構，據云：行政首長皆爲民選，彼等尙擬邀國民黨人參加，使成聯合形式，據稱：此係根據政協決議，至東北除外之決定，彼等多不提及，此等事賣，率係最近發生者。東北境內有八路軍，亦係近半年內之事，去年接收人員抵此間時，尙在醞釀中，今竟遍地皆是，發展之速，令人驚奇。一般以爲，此等事實之存在，固已在外交上增加不少困難，然若外交與內政截然分開，則解次亦至易易。目前問題焦點仍在外交，但此外交必須公開進行，，一反過去秘密從事、相信倘此間外交活動自始即取公開方式，則次不致有今日之複雜局面。又關於撫順事件，此間始終未發表，大部人民皆不知有此慘案，此最易招致人心已死之誤解。以記者觀察，當前東北間題雖極嚴重，然若接受過去經騐，善求解次之道，亦非不能立即打開僵局，惟此價局打開後之收拾問題，尢其是從事此收拾工作之人選問題，則不能不重新考慮。</p>
<h3>長春蘇軍參謀長聲明　撤退工作進行中　期能於美軍離華以前完成</h3>
<p>〔塔斯社長春廿六日電〕　林諾夫斯基元帥之參謀長德羅生柯中將，今日舉行新聞記者招待會，發表聲明如下：「鑒於中外報紙所載各種不準確之消息，歪曲蘇軍自東北延遲撤退之眞實情形，馬林諾夫斯基元帥司令部意欲澄淸此種局勢」。「蘇軍之撤退，自一九四五年十一月即開始，但其後因中國政府第一次與第二次之請求，暫行停止，延至二月一日。一九四六年一月十五日，蘇軍又重復撤退，目下仍在進行中，而相當數目之蘇軍，業已離開東北」。「但蘇軍之撤退於進行時所以略有遷延者，乃因中國政府軍隊進駐蘇軍所遺下地區異常緩遲之故，結果在多次情形中，蘇軍不知將所撤土地交與何人。關於此點，有一事値得注意，即去年秋季，中國政府曾不止一次向蘇軍司令提出抗議，謂蘇軍不待中國政府軍隊抵達，即行撤退」。「蘇軍司令部不得不重視此種局勢。此外，必須牢記者，即東北之鐵路與車輛，一大部份已為受紅軍打擊而潰退之日軍所破摧毀，東北煤斤之缺乏與冬季情形，在大體上，對正常之鐵路交通，造成嚴重障礙」。「最後，沿交通錢尤其沿鐵路錢，由於日偽軍隊殘餘所形成之匪徒繼續活躍，並實行進攻，因而妨礙蘇軍之自由移動」。「東北蘇軍指揮部，預期於美軍司令部能將在華美軍撤退之時間以前，完成蘇軍之撤退工作，或無論如何，不遲於此一時間。是以中外某數報紙所載，蘇軍故意自東北延遲撤退之一切消息，均係仇蘇·反動·反民主份子之誹謗揑造，其目的乃在動搖中國民衆對將滿洲日本本帝國主義匪徒奴役中解放出來之紅軍的信任與善意」。</p>
<h3>東北境內工業設備　蘇聯無搬運特權　美國務卿否認曾有協議</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿六日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯（見圖），今下午於記者招待會中，否認任何三國協定規定蘇聯可取走中國東北境內之機械或工廠設備。記者詢以國務卿知否有任何集團力量國欲破壞四强團結，樂鄭重答稱，四强定可能於平時繼續合作，亦如其於戰時之合作然。</p>
<p>〔美新聞處華盛頓廿六日電〕國務卿只爾納斯本日在招待記者會中宣稱：彼未獲蘇聯佔領部隊自滿州撤退之任何報吿。渠作此聲明時，係答覆記者詢問，以倫敦傳來消息，據莫斯科無綫電廣播，蘇聯在滿州佔領軍大部已行撤退。某記者稱：瀋陽蘇軍司令曾言紅軍自瀋陽若十工廠移去重工業設備，係根據三巨頭之協議，該記者乃詢以果有此種協議否？貝爾納斯答稱：據彼所知，並無此種協議。又某記者詢問、中國方面是否曾以蘇軍搬運物資之事通知美國政府，氏答曰否。貝爾納斯復否認美國政府曾自其自身機構或中蘇方面，獲得蘇聯於鐵路及旅順·大連二港之協定以外，要求滿洲商業特權之報吿。</p>
<h3>蘇聯新併版圖　美國已予同意</h3>
<p>記者詢國務卿，蘇聯以千島及南庫頁島併人其版圖，是否有違下稱方式，即凡屬永久　置前敵人領土，應於和會時行之，而不應出以片面行動。又此是否可為美國獲取太平洋設防基地之先例？貝爾的斯答稱：如彼比所言，根據國際公法，凡劃讓領土應以條約方式出之，倘根據國際公法，欲使某一土地為人所承認，則唯有循條約之手續方可，此或出於自動，或如戰敗國之出於被動。貝氏答覆記者詢問，以除訂有條約外，彼是否不擬承認以上述地區割讓蘇聯，貝氏曰，美國接受協議之約束，已同意支持將該項土地讓與蘇聯，日後締結條約之時，彼將主張美國應股踐其諾言，而於條約內則入以上稱土地劃入蘇聯版圖之條文。記者有詢以倘於談判締結條約之時，有人提出反對，又將如何？貝爾納斯答稱：其時當可決定應採行之步驟。</p>
<h3>外記者招待會　吳部長答問</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿七日電〕外記者招待會今日午後三時舉行，由吳部長國楨，何司長鳳山主持，茲錄主要問答如次：</p>
<p>（問）蘇聯新聞廣播稱，最近重慶學生反對雅爾達密約及蘇對東北政策之遊行，係由中國政府協助或組織，請一述中國之官方態度如何？</p>
<p>（答）政府從未協助或組織學生之遊行，相反的事實，政府曾用各種方法，予以勸阻，凡目賭在重慶學生之遊行者，必能感覺完全出諸自動，且學生俱在，諸君可親往詢問。</p>
<p>（問）請詳確示知最近在京舉行之軍事會議之次議如何？</p>
<p>（答）是次會議，僅有兩項議題、就整編眾隊方面，決定就現有之　　二百七十三師編爲九十師，此項調整，約於五月底可完成，縮編後，將完成統一編制，此一工作，約需時六個月，另就整編後之編餘軍官土兵，商決就業安插辦法。</p>
<p>（問）前者王外長就有關東北蘇軍撤退間題，向蘇方提出詢問，中國政府已否接得答覆？</p>
<p>（答）政府至目前為止，尙未接到答覆。</p>
<p>（問）駐蘇大使傅秉常返渝，是否携有蘇方態度之聲明文件？</p>
<p>（答）傳大使數週前離莫斯科，赴英倫參加聯合國大會，是次乃逕由倫敦返渝，自無任何文件携返。</p>

<h3>京滬金價續跌</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕京市金價因滬價報疲，今午續跌進盤十四萬。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶廿七日電〕今日黃金廠條上午開盤，最高十四萬二千元，收盤十四萬元。鑄條收盤十三萬七千元。美鈔最高二〇四〇元，收盤二〇二元。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿七日電〕故都當局今日下令，停止金條與銀條交易。憲兵奉令前往各登記商號及黑市商號拆除電話。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕本市黃金美鈔證券等行市，昨再趨下游，黃金一度低達十三萬八千元，美鈔下挫更銳，最低曾至二〇七〇元，其他各債市股市等，均一致疲莫能興，又據金融界人土稱：過去黑市金價，曾昇至美鈔七十五元折合黃金一兩之最高峯，依照今日市價，則已低至六十六元三角折合一兩矣。但美國黃金官價，每兩只合美元三十五元，雖亦略有黑市跡象，距離亦不甚大，故本市黑市金價，遠高於美國市塲，如今後美鈔價格趨跌，或漸臻穩定，則金價亦必將逐步低落。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿六日電〕漢糧價已回落，每担下跌約五千元，市府並邀有關機關，同組民食調節委會，以抑漲風。</p>
<h3>宋院長由漢抵滬　將主持外匯市塲開放事宜</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院院長宋子文，偕夫人張樂怡女士，秘書許世璿，朱忠道等一行，於昨晨九時許，自漢口搭機繼續東飛，十二時半抵滬，同來者尙有資源委員會副主任委員錢昌照，敵偽產業處理局局長劉攻芸等，宋院長旋於三時廿分驅車赴外灘中國銀行大樓行政院臨時駐滬辦事處辦公，先後延見台灣省行政長官陳儀，及該公署顧問李擇一，中國銀行總經理宋漢章等。聞宋院長此次來滬，將主持外匯市塲之開放對中央銀行管理外匯買賣掛牌等手續，亦將指示機宜，期達安定金融，平穩物價之宏旨。又宋院長此次留滬期間，將不致過長，可能於外匯市場手續部署完畢後，遄返重慶，出席二中全會。又新任中央銀行總裁貝祖詒，原定昨日自渝飛滬履新，因阻於氣候，未獲成行一二內當可抵滬。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿七日電〕宋院長及夫人等一行十餘人，昨日由渝飛滬，於下午六時許抵武漢，因氣候關係，在此間降落，故事前知者甚少，下榻中國銀行後，曾接見王主席，郭副長官，徐市長等，行營程主任亦曾往謁。宋氏於今晨九時飛京轉滬，同行者有錢昌照，劉攻芸，據宋氏語人，外匯市塲開放後，渝金價已下跌，政府對安定金融，當採有效措施，今後金價勢將繼續回跌。糧食方面，善救總署援華食糧，即可大量運漢，漲風亦必戢止。</p>
<p>〔木報訊〕財政部駐京滬區特派員辦公處，前曾奉財部電准提前於本月底結束，茲財部以京滬區財政金融事宜尙未料理完竣，故又電令展期二月，將延長至本年四月底結束。</p>
<h3>經營外匯行號　週一開始登記</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨連訪各金融關係當局，獲悉本市中央銀行已正式接奉開放外匯市場方案及管理外匯暫行辦法等訓令，現正積極籌備各項手續，以備如期於三月四日（星期一）開始外匯掛牌。至經營外匯業務之行號，除若干「指定銀行」尚待指定公布外，其他如核定准許經營之銀行，銀號，錢莊，旅行社及經紀人等，須經申請手續，申請所需之表格，分行號及經紀人二種，刻正趕印中，將於下週一起開始接受申請登記，限期十五日，如經審核許可，將發給准許經營憑證，以憑營業。</p>
<p>據合衆社紐約廿六日電稱：中國穩定法幣價値之舉，或與美進出口銀行謀發展中國出口貿易之大借款談判有關。此間非正式謠傳新匯率或爲法幣一千元對美金一元。</p>
<h3>進出口商表示</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕政府公布開放外匯市塲，廢止官價外匯匯率，已引起此間金融界之密切反應。據某金融權威分析，當局此種非常措施，將有助於物價之平抑，今後外匯價格之漲落，胥視進出口爲決定，惟官價匯率廢止後，國際貿易商人不無感受威脅，是以在對外貿易上，或有多少影響。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市進出口商均在密切注視下星期一之外匯掛牌。怡和洋行某高級職員昨告記者稱：彼深信此後彼等之業務可望漸復正常，但仍極盼政府買賣外匯價格之差額相距不致過鉅。彼謂：即照目前規定之辦法，出口商已頗感周折，因彼等於墊付大宗現欵購得貨物之後，必須交由商品檢騐局檢騐，而此項工作頗費時日，檢騐完竣後，再電外國報價，需俟覆電到達後，始可憑電至指定經營外匯之銀行請求證明，然後報關輸出。此時期中所耗拆息，實已可觀，如於收到外匯外，於結價時再打一極大之折扣，則出口商所獲更微矣。彼之希望爲此項差額不超過一成。</p>
<h3>關內外已通滙</h3>
<p>匯率暫定一比十三</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿四日電〕關內外匯兌，現已開通，此間中央銀行已奉渝總行電令，開始承辦，其匯率在財部正式規定前，皆以一比十三之標準辦理，即由東北行交流通券一元，關內各地收款人可得法幣十三元。此間中央銀行定廿五日首先開始舉辦軍政匯欵及公務員贍家匯款。又錦州三行，亦即可陸續開辦。各地公務員匯欵。凡經主管機關證明確係瞻家者，均免收匯水。關於商匯將嚴格限制數量，以免有逃購物資及其他不正當交易。</p>
<h3>二期緊急農　全數撥交中農</h3>
<p>十億元分配決定</p>
<p>〔本報重慶廿七日電〕據悉，第二期十億元緊急救濟農貸，已由財政部如數撥交中農銀行辦理。各省配給數如下：江蘇六千萬元，廣東五千萬元，廣西四千萬元，湖北二千萬元，江西三千萬元，安徽二千萬元，浙江六千萬元，福建五千萬元，山東一億八千萬元，河南四千萬元，山西二千萬元，河北一億八千萬元，綏遠三千萬元，東九省一億五千萬元。</p>

<h3>西班牙問題嚴重　美照會英國謂弗朗哥政權必須結束　英對法之行動不表贊同</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿七日廣播稱：英國政府今日接獲華盛頓照會一件，內稱：西班牙弗朗哥政權，必須立即予以結束。英國政府對此照會正在考慮中。又訊：英國總工會今日發表宣言，請求英美立衆與西班牙弗朗哥政權斷絕邦交。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿七日電〕此間法人三萬，今日羣集於梵萊特羅姆，以憤怒之情緒，將西班牙獨裁者弗朗哥之肖像付之一炬，並對宣吿封鎖法西邊界一事歡呼示慶，羣衆皆要求與西班牙完全斷絕外交在係。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕法國政府昨日決定自下週五起封閉法西兩國邊界，並以新照會致英美，重申法方認爲西班牙現局「危害國際安全」之見解，同時英國政府已急電英駐西大使馬萊爵士，囑其詳細調查西班牙共和黨人十人上週在馬德里被處決事。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿七日電〕法政府今日決定美英兩國如仍擬與西班牙弗朗哥政府維持經濟外交關係，即準備將法國反對弗朗哥政權事，提付聯合國安全理事會討論。預料法外長舉社爾將要求英美在外交戰綫上支持法國，聯合對西斷絕一切關係。此外據亨達伊消息：傳聞西班牙當局已於今晨封鎖法國邊境，即較法國宣布封鎖時間早四十八小時。法內閣現決定法西兩國間一切鐵路公路郵電交通三月一日午夜起切實斷絕，其對法西兩國於去年九月所簽訂商約適吿滿期。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿七日電〕英外務省發言人本日對於法國政府下令封鎖法西邊境一項行動，不表贊成。據稱：此類事故或將延長弗朗哥之政權，使西班牙元首成爲「民族英雄」而非叛徒。但英國亦痛恨弗朗哥，亟望西班牙出現民即擁護的政府云。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿七日電〕巴黎電台稱：法內閣決定封鎖法西邊境後未及十二小時，西方即下令不許西法邊界之西班牙軍隊吿假，惟此訊尙未能得西方人士證實。法內閣昨復次議再致　英美政府，申述法國認爲西班牙之現局，構成危害國際全之條件。</p>
<p>〔聯合社社馬德里廿七日電〕西班牙各報今日初次刊載法政府決定封鎖法西邊境及努力促使英美對西絕交之詳細消息，並發表長篇評諭，斥責法國共產黨及蘇聯。</p>

<p>〔路透社康白拉廿七日〕澳外長埃伐特昨宣佈，前政治經濟學講師舊金山會議澳代表飽爾，業被任爲聯合王國·澳大利亞，紐西蘭及印度之代表，參加四國管制日本委員會。此職由澳人擔任，可證英國及共和邦其他國家，已願增加澳大利亞在大洋區之地位，亦可證不列顚諸國間之合作。按四國委員會於麥帥實施十一國遠東委員會所擬定之指令時，負有諮詢顧問之責。</p>

<p>〔路透社德黑蘭廿七日電〕紐約泰晤士報特派員稱：伊朗之蘇軍距應行撤退完畢之期僅有四日，而猶無退兵之象微。防軍人數未减，鐵路仍由蘇軍控制，英軍幾已全部退出，而蘇聯部隊仍在其佔領區週圍嚴密戒備，無蘇方特許者一概不得進入亞塞爾拜然區，而蘇方之入境證，又極難取得。蘇聯之能度，引起伊朗人民普遍之恐懼。</p>

<h3>聯合國大會傍聽記　旗鼓相當的兩位風雲人物　貝文·維辛斯基　康納利與曼紐易斯基也是一對老搭擋</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　余風寄自倫敦</p>
<p>聯合國大會初開時，好多人搖頭嘆息，他們並不是預料聯合國大會之必敗，而是感嘆大會裹缺少出色人物。尤其是新聞記者，更覺得具有新聞價値人物之稀少，因此異常懷念第一次戰後的「老虎總理」克里蒙梭，勞合喬治和威爾遜。</p>
<p>安全理事會開過兩次會後，大家的觀念就開始改變，認爲大會在製造歷史，也在製造風雲人物，及至大會結束，大家更是志得意滿，因爲這大會，非特有有聲有色的出色人物，而且在外交史上實在是一個劃時代的記錄。在這大會裏，淘汰了以前的所謂「外交辭令」，所有演說爭辯，全是開門見山，大刀闊斧，次非以前之扭扭揑揑，迂廻宛轉。</p>
<p>大刀闊斧針鋒相對</p>
<p>英國外交部長貝文，和艾登的作風全不相同。他並不講究衣飾，次不讓什麼禮服去束縛他自己。他是碼頭工人出身，有江湖豪俠之風，要說就痛痛快快的說。和蘇聯的外交委員會副委員長維辛斯基旗鼓相當。</p>
<p>維辛斯基在辯論裏次不讓人，他能講英語，但在會塲裏，他總用他本國的語言。他的話轉輾翻譯，也許已沒有原文精形，但在翻譯裏，還可以聽出他的機智聰明。</p>
<p>安全理事會接到的控訴案件中，第一件是伊朗控吿蘇聯，英國支持伊期。伊朗提出控訴後的翌日，蘇聯提出英軍在希臘，烏克蘭提出英軍在爪哇的「威脅世界和平。」最後又有叙利亞黎巴嫩提出駐在它們國內英法軍「危害和平」的伸訴。本文囑稿時，黎叙事件還正在討論未見頭緒但其他三案件都已討論完結。這三案件中，英蘇都是對立的主角，互相辯論，互相攻擊。因此開安全理事會，就是看貝文和維辛斯基鬥法。</p>
<p>倫敦多霧一語雙關</p>
<p>兩人鬥法的序幕，從討論軍事參謀會議的日期時開始，那時美國斯退丁紐斯提議二月一日開會，維　斯基說不能那麼確定，蘇聯軍　代表不一定能在一號趕到，「因爲，」他語帶雙關的說：「倫敦和莫斯科間氣候惡劣！」貝文次不讓人，笑着說：「但願蘇聯代表能在二月一日前把這些濃霧消除。」維辛斯基立刻推推舌人，叫他翻譯：「可是倫敦的霧總是比別的地方濃得多多！」</p>
<p>自此以後，兩個人時常交換着幽默的針鋒相對的對白。他們兩人，在安全理事會馬蹄形的桌子上，是貼身緊鄰。有時兩人相對搶白一場，又握手言歸於好。有一家倫敦報紙，畫着貝文維辛斯基赤膊執劍，在作中世紀時代的次鬥。</p>
<p>嘴湊耳朶隻字不漏</p>
<p>約辛斯基的私人解譯，坐在他身後，嘴湊着他的耳朶。貝文說一句，他在耳邊譯一句，所以貝文說的什麼，維辛斯基一字不漏，全然知曉，可以當塲作答。</p>
<p>討論希臘爪哇事件時，維辛斯基引證種種英國下議院辯論希臘爪哇事件時反對派的責難，那些下議員也有些說英國在干涉人家內政。他又引證英國報紙上的通訊，那　駐外記者也　　英國政府，認爲英軍支持的並不是革命政府。貝文一面話，一面抽烟，接着斜銜着香烟作答：「我們英國議會，可以自由發言，一件事，正反意見都有，我眞奇怪，維辛斯基先生對一面的意見，這樣熟悉，對另一面意見，却這樣生疏，明天我可以給你送一份議會紀錄，請你研究研究另一方面的意見。」</p>
<p>語涉報界開盡玩笑</p>
<p>「至於報紙，只是給人消閒解　的，（To　Amusc　to　Entertain.）有時且不免誤導讀者，（To　Mislead）我天天看報，因此，對報紙所說所載，也就不會這樣感到嚴重。」引起在座記者大笑。</p>
<p>第二天安全理事會開會時，維辛斯基說：「貝文先生竟會覺得報紙只是消閒解悶的東西，眞是有像報界尊嚴。傳遞消息，全靠報紙。像我們又沒有軍隊在外國，如不靠報紙，靠什麼情報？」接着，他又引證了一段英國每日先鋒報（Daily　Herald）的記載，笑着說：「對這份報紙，貝文先生該稍存敬意吧！」全體哄堂。因爲每日先鋒報是工黨機關報</p>
<p>貝文對此並未正面作答，只抽一口烟，笑笑說：「我懶得再和報紙開玩笑了。」</p>
<p>雙雙鬥法搥拳擊桌</p>
<p>他們兩人爭吵得緊張時，也搥拳拍桌，全塲鴉雀無聲。維辛斯基說話時，又愛用手勢，手執鉛筆，我常担心他會指到隔座的貝文臉上。貝文發言提到維辛斯基時，老愛兩眼釘着維辛斯基，而且發言時，嘴裏有時還　着香烟。</p>
<p>貝文雙頰的肌肉時常抽動，緊張時抽動更烈。維辛斯基說到激昻處，一絲笑意也沒有。一時就會陰雲密佈，似乎大風暴將臨。但就是在這陰暗局面下，他們總不忘記帶來一二點星星。有時緊張處，貝文突然會說：「我的朋友維辛斯基是法律學家，對條文當然很明白。」或是正磨拳擦掌間，維辛斯基又會笑嘻嘻的稱貝文爲Hot　Headed　Man。</p>
<p>貝文太太出席傍聽</p>
<p>因爲他們在安全理事會的種種精彩表演，弄得人人想旁聽安全理事會，小房間上下擠得沒法通風。理事會開會時，並不禁止抽烟，吞雲吐霧，又熱又悶。有一次會議時，因要拍攝電影，燈光通明，胖子貝文熱得滿臉是汗。</p>
<p>希臘問題討論時，貝文維辛斯基吵得最兇，但會後貝文去出席維辛斯基的鷄尾酒會，兩人談得比誰都投機，笑得比誰都開心。</p>
<p>貝文脣槍舌戰時，他太太也曾出席，許多代表的太太紛紛要旁聽證，似乎染了先生的習氣，對政治興趣特濃。</p>
<p>維辛斯基太太未來，他的女兒却與他偕來。在他的招待會席上，女兒是女主人。維辛斯基原籍波蘭，機警善辯，現在是莫洛托夫手下的第一紅人。</p>
<p>貝文在安全理事會開會期間，因爲他勇敢直言，聲望大增。在美國都是人人討論貝文。去聽理事會時，似乎就是去聽只文和維辛斯基抬槓。</p>
<p>另一搭擋半夜怒吼</p>
<p>在大會裏善於搭檔的，還不止貝文和維辛斯基兩人。還有另外一對老搭擋——鳥克蘭的曼紐易斯基和美國的上議員康納利。兩人都已鬚髮如銀，但是火氣大極。康納利聲音洪亮，發脾氣時更是聲嘶力竭。在小組委員會討論國際工會聯盟要參加聯合國大會問題時，康納利說：「現在倒要討論這件事，幹什麼我們美國工會要參加，就一聲不響的拒絕，眞是刮我們的鬍子!」主席是一位能言善語的比國外長史巴克。史巴克說：「我眞不懂爲什麼你要挿進這句話來！」康納利咆哮如雷：「你以爲我不知道？哼！有一批人在操縱這小紐會呢！」當時已午夜一時，大家想起此事，都認爲夜半怒吼。</p>
<p>咆哮下台握手言歡</p>
<p>大會結束時，又討論這事，先是曼紐易斯甚發言，一口好法文，認爲國際工會聯盟應該參加大會。演說甫畢，康納利立刻登台，大聲疾呼，左一聲曼紐易斯基先生，右一聲曼紐易斯基博士，問得曼紐易斯基也笑起來。康老先生越說越有勁，搥桌拍掌，幾乎把桌子也拍穿。咆哮完畢下台，他又和曼紐易斯基大握手，鬧得全塲大笑，他太太也在塲。可謂是聯合國大會中最精彩的壓台戲。也是這和平會議中最後的一塲戰鬥。（二月十五日寄自倫敦）</p>

<h3>讀者意見　讀「如何籌措工業建設資金」後</h3>
<p>— 張毓珊</p>
<p>戰爭結東以後，各國均努力從事復興工作。中國爲產業落後之國，對此項復興事業，尤感股切。吾人深期中國在經濟建設方面，能迅速走向工業化之途徑。一國工業建建設，固須具備種種必要之基本條件，但資金之籌措，實佔首要。最近趙同運先生「如何籌措工業建設資金」一文（見本月十七日本報）曾有創設中國復興工業金融公司之建議，良以我國工業建設所需機械·材料·人力爲量基鉅，其所需長期資金，當非普通銀行組織所能供應，同時吾國對外匯率，一時不易確定，廠商向外訂購器材所需之外匯，不易結購，故擬創設中國復興工業金融公司，由國家銀行及主要商業銀行·信託公司·保險公司等，共同投資美金五億元及國幣五十億元，以作扶助工業復興之中心金融機構。此項議設之公司，並非創造性的建議，蓋英美諸工業先進國家，均有是項機構之設立，中國一切工業建設，尙在萌芽時期，故對於扶助工業復典之中心金融機構，更有迫切之需要。能實現至少有下列利益：</p>
<p>（一）解決工業建設所需之資金我國資金貧乏，工業建設所需長期資金及中期資金之籌措，最感困難。誠能有一中心金融機構統籌供應作合理與有效之運用，則此項困難，自可解決。</p>
<p>（二）吸收外資用於有利之生產各國在華投資，爲數甚鉅，但大部份用於不生產之途，故不僅與中國經濟之發展無所補益，凡使中國在政治與經濟方面，處於更不利之地位。中國復興工業金融公司之設立，一方面可引導外資絕對作生產建設事業之投資；同時可運用政府之力量，加强公司在外國之信用，則利用外資之數額與範圍，益形廣汎。</p>
<p>（三）輸入品之質的轉變復興工業金融公司，旣代理廠商向外國訂購工業建設所需材料，則吾國輸入之機械原料將大量增加。是項輸入商品之質的轉變，將爲吾國國際貿易史上劃一新紀元，其有利於國家經濟之繁榮殆無疑議</p>
<p>（四）加强穩定外匯之力量　吾國民間所持有之黃金，外幣債券及外匯，爲數至鉅。統個人言，此項持有之財，僅發生保持購買力之作用；就整個國家言，此項鉅量賣金，絲毫未發生有利於國家生產之作用。現旣有復興工業之中心金融機構，則民問持有之黃金，外幣債券，及外匯，均可作合理與有效之運用。</p>
<p>吾人確認創設中國復興工業金融公司之建議，在完成工業化的偉大經濟建設之過程中，實有其必然存在之價值。但中國幅員遼闊，各種工業建設之種類與範圍，至爲廣汎，是否以五億美元及五十億國幣之運用，即能完成此項百世之大業，故資本之數額，實有重行考慮之必要。</p>
<p>八年抗戰，民生凋敝，勝利以還，一切的生產事業，復陷於停滯狀態，吾人深感敵僞財產之處理，絕不能以財政收人爲唯一目標，應以維持及增加生產爲前提。「殺鷄取卵」爲智者所勿取。吾人深望財政當局，從遠處着眼，近處着手，當機立斷，先集中全力，斬破惡性循環之鎖鏈。庶幾中國復興工業金融公司之設立，當能促進工業建設，而獲增加生產之實效。</p>
<h3>專論　抑平特價應採取之對策</h3>
<p>— 徐爾信</p>
<p>自和平勝利以來，各地物價，繼續上漲，尤以煨近農歷新年開市後，漲勢愈劇，如火如荼。凡握有黃金外幣股票及各種貨物者，均獲有暴利。其擁有游資者，紛向銀行提現，購買金鈔物資，爭先恐後，暗息暴騰至二以上，人心皇皇，社會呈露極度不安之現象，平民申吟憔悴，生活痛苦，達於極點。蔣主席在杭，聞訊特蒞滬召見金融工商界要人，指示抑平對策，可見　主席雖日理萬幾，固無時不關懷民瘼。在此物價高漲之際，滬上有識之士，有王張將政府所存黃金，儘量懸牌以官似拋售，藉以抑平金價，穩定物價。亦有主張黃金收回國有，使黃金不能作祟，失去領導物價之作用。實則物價上漲，有其自然與人爲之原因，牽涉政治金融貨幣財政生產消費交通運輸及居奇操縱等問題。金價漲固有刺激物價漲之可能，但究不能謂金價有確實領導一般物價之必然性。目前市場游資充斥、無適當歸宿之所，東西氾濫，數額甚鉅，以政府現存之黃金拋售，車薪杯水，勢難持續，倘一旦金盡策窮，則金價狂跳，此次重慶停止掛牌之所發生現象，不難重演。各地民間所有之黃金，雖乏精確統計，佔計數量必甚鉅，政府收回國有，即使其價格一部份搭配公價，一部給現，此項鉅額鈔幣之　發，勢必增加物價上升之度數，且美鈔亦可代黃金起而發生領導物價之作用。黃金收回國有之理論，在目前尚無實行之可能，且祗能視爲安定金融之一辦法，絕不能用爲仰止當前極複雜之物價問題的善良對策。作者認爲當前物價上漲，由於通貨數量之膨脹，物資之缺乏，與國民對法幣缺乏信仰之三大原因。</p>
<p>抑平物價，因此，必須於造成物價上漲兩個自然原人」三方面由政府與全體國民於整個方面，爲標本兼施之策，一致共同努力。否則僅局部辦理，頭痛醫頭，脚痛　脚，或政府諉過於小民，或人民非難於政府，其結果爲「扶得東來西又倒」甚或毫無成效可言。作者此論，持之甚早，今再將此項實施對策，分別重申於下：</p>
<p>（甲）關於「幣」的方而：（一）收縮通貨，在目前之中央銀行，雖尙不能採用提高貼現率及公開市場政策，以收縮通貨，但中央銀行旣處於「銀行之銀行」地位，且發鈔已有集中之趨勢，以後對於他銀行之拆放，固須愼重，即對政府之墊借，亦應有相當限制，務使多收少吐。對銀錢業頭寸之調度，並應嚴加監督，所有各行莊信用抵押等放款，隨時實施調查，防止用作投機方面。（二）整頓各項稅收，使之充裕，尤以直接稅之須認眞整頓，以轉移國民之購買力。並絕對查禁包稅制，嚴格剔除中飽，務使涓滴歸公。（三）裁撤駢枝機關並調整各級機構，使之合理化。裁减冗員，注重行政效能。暫時採用「與民休養」之政策，停止一切不急之務，務使收支達到平衡。（四）發行新公債或臨時庫券，强迫富戶承銷。（五）舉辦財富登記，所有各種有形無形之財富，均須一律登記，其戶名應以戶籍法所規定發給之國民身份證上之姓名爲限，不得有化名。此項財富之登記，可爲整頓直接稅極大之助力，並可爲派募公債之根據，合於賦稅負担能力之原則。（六）接收各地之敵僞工廠，按其資產，發行股票出售。並速成立合法之證券交易市場，引導游資趨於工商事業，納人正軌。（七）提倡儲畜或强迫國民儲蓄，或舉辦有獎儲蓄。（八）提高儲蓄存款利率，對信用活期存款，予以限制，並隨時調查其去路，以防游資作祟。（九）裁編軍隊，採精兵主義，所有編餘官兵，從事屯墾及工農，以增加生產。（十）凡有獨佔性及私人不能舉辦之企業，或由國營，或官商合辦，即以所入補助國庫之不足，或可吸收私人一部份游資。</p>
<p>（乙）關於「物」的方而：（一）恢復水陸交通，山日俘實行築路浚河工程，增加運貨舟車，以便利貨物之運輸。（二）公私工廠，限期一律開工，原有敵僞工廠，得屆用日籍技術員繼續負責。（三）獎勵私人投資於各種企業，並予以保本保息。（四）勞資應採協調原則，嚴禁政治性之罷工怠工行爲。（五）向外國貸欵，並供給各種金業適量之外匯，使購進必需之原料與機件，以擴充生產。（六）將接收敵僞封存倉庫之物資，普遍平賣，並防止爲好商壟斷漁利。（七）充分運輸煤斤，供給低廉之電力。（八）嚴禁各地類似　之通過稅，並實行取締一切苛雜。</p>
<p>（丙）關於「人」的方面：（一）安定人心，喚起國民對法幣發生信心，打破其重物輕幣之觀念，須由全國國民以「父敎其子兄勉其弟」之精神，一致共同努力，庶使法幣信用增强，價値提高。（坍發通貨，固能使物價上漲，但通貨流通加速，允易促成物價上漲。目前人民拋出法幣，搶購貨物，法幣流通甚速，即使收縮通貨，增產物資，實行能有成效，而一般國民，仍存輕賤法幣之觀念，物置仍須上漲，故增强法幣之信心，實爲提高法幣價値必備之條件。）。（二）取締投機如嚴禁黑市非法買賣，檢查倉庫物資，辦理登記，調查票據去路，查究有關金融謠言根源，懲辦投機操縱奸商，但此等消極辦法，僅能收一時之效果。（三）國內和平團結，並改良政治，使人民對政府發生擁護與敬仰，因而迎帶及於愛護法幣與信仰法幣。（四）政府當局在未能將金融政策（例如外匯率之決定）明白宣示以前，宜愼重言論，更不宜前後言論不符，或事後聲明否認，使投機者揣摩意旨，藉爲造謠取巧，投機牟利之機會。（五）提倡節約，實行耐勞忍苦，以免物資之浪費。</p>
<p>凡上所述各項實施對策，雖卑之無甚高論，如果政府與全國國民，共起而分別實行，物價上漲問題，不難迎刃解決，物價旣能逐漸下降，幣値因而穩固，民生獲得安定，則發行所謂「孫票」未免庸人自擾。願國人一致擁護國民政府，愛護並信仰國府發行之法幣，使其價値永久穩固，物價不生波動，共享康樂之生活。如有不惜破壞法幣之價値，動搖對法幣之信念，希圖因物價之上漲而獲取暴利，應視爲國民之公敵。</p>

<p>物資分配供應不敷</p>

<p>自由談　婦女與家庭特輯</p>
<p>思想</p>
<h3>女子有才便是德（上）</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>在「女子無才便是德」的這句所謂古聖賢「調言」之下，不知埋沒了多少女性的天才，不知剝奪了多少女子受敎育的機會。</p>
<p>數千年來，我國的女性，一直被可怕的舊禮敎的極梏束縛着，沒有一點自由。一般社會的統治者，以及身居士大夫階級的「鴻儒」之輩，爲了壓迫女性，奴化女性，首先不讓女子有受敎育的繼會，造成男女間知識的不平等。因爲知識的不平等，其他一切自然也都不平等了。女子的地位旣然不能和男子平等，從此她們便一直隸屬於男子，成爲男士掌握中的「玩物」，男子可以拿「貞操」這個名詞來窒塞女性情感的泉源，而男子却可以公開納妾，不受與論的制裁，誘姦遣棄的賣任男子可以不理。所以在封建社會中，女子是供男子隨便宰割的綿年。「女子無才使是德」這句數千年來奉爲天經地義的古聖賢「訓言」，更是那些衛道的「鴻儒」所用以牢籠女性的鐐銬，犧性在這下面的實在太多了。</p>
<p>早該廢棄的訓言</p>
<p>時代變了，這句「訓言」，似乎已經在無形中被淘汰了。在提倡男女平權的今日，在促進男女敎育機會均等的今日，我們自然不容許再讓這種思想存在。然而現在的中國社會，還表現着半封建色彩，一切不正確的傳統觀念，並沒有能完全根除。就像這句牢籠了數千年的中國女性的「訓言」，現在還有人認爲是眞理，一般自命爲倡導「賢妻良母敎育」的人，還拿這句早該廢棄的「訓言」做他們的思想根據。女子敎育在這五十年間的進步，我們不能否認，但是女子在知識上的地位還比不上男子，這中間固然有種種原因，可是有一點我們絕對無法否認，社會大多數的人對於受教育的目的看錯的很多，他們以爲女子受教育不過是一種點綴，一種裝飾。有幾個人相信女子讀書是爲了「學以致用」？有幾個人相信女子讀書可以在知識上取得和男子同樣的地位？「畢業證書爲粧奪之一」的觀念，似乎有很多人發生同感。</p>
<p>不要說在中國，就是德法諸國，他們的女子敎育不能不算發達，然面「到廚房去」喊成一片呼聲·美國的「新娘學校」專門供給未來的新娘關於治家敎予的知識，好像女子的「才」至多也僅能發展到廚房和新房。就事實說，女子的天性和職能，當然適宜於處置家務，然而在另一方面我們却不能不亟力擴大女子敎育的範圍。尤其在今日的中國，抗戰八年，終獲勝利，以後要踏上建國的前程，向建設新中國的大道邁進。我們需要無數的知識女性，和男子共同爲國家和社會服務，爲人羣謀福利。要達到這個目的，我們首先要改正一般人對於女子敎育的謬誤觀念，要在可能的範圍內，擴大敎育的目標，讓女性們可以自由地充實她們的知能，有滿足求知慾的機會。</p>
<p>適應和活的能力</p>
<p>我們要把「女子無才便是德」的這句反動口號取消了，換上一句「女子有才便是德」。在這裏，所謂「才」就是一個人的適應生活的能力，這是廣義的，包括一切日常生活的知識和技能。眞正的知識技能必頭配合着實踐才可以發生意義。理論和實際的打開一片，自然能够很適宜地順應一切自治，從而改善生活。這樣，由個人而社會，由小我到大我，一定可以把人類的世界推向光明的前程。就算丟開國家和社會來說，（實際上改善了個人也就改善了國家和社會），一個知識技能充實的女子，對於治家敎子之道，必定有更大的幫助，這是沒有問題的。怎樣使自己的家務處理得有條理，很適宜，怎樣使自己的子女受到良好的家庭敎養。（治家敎子男子自然也有責任），這些都須有充分的知能，不是隨便什麼人都僅得的。治家敎子，讓那些愚昧無知的女子去處理，決不會有辦法。何况國家和社會與個人的關係至深且切，今後的女性不是關在高樓上隸屬於男子的「玩物」了，她們應該是自覺的「社會的一員」，應該認淸自己對於社會乃至對於人羣所處的地位和責職。</p>
<p>有意衷腸的共同行爲</p>
<p>至於「德」，係泛指「道德」這側名詞。這裏面包括「德行」和「品格」。根據近世倫理學家的研究，道德的涵義極廣。過去人們所視爲道德的，現在已經失去時代的意義，不再有道德的價値了。當然人類也有共同的各觀的道德標準，可以有比較垂久的價値，然而道德總是社會的產物，時代的變遷和社會的進化，隨時可以改變人們對於道德的觀念。道德是一種行爲的規律，社會中各個分子，爲適應共同需要而發生一種有意識的共同行爲的規律，便是道德。在原始社會裏，都以爲道德出於神的命令，道德的觀念出於神的賜予。這樣道德便套上宗敎的外衣。民智日開，這德被認爲是「理性」的指示，人們在肉體之我以外，有一個「理性之我」，這說法雖然擺脫了宗敎「神」的色彩，然與現代論理觀念仍不相合。</p>
<p>美國心理學家費息爾（S.Fischir）謂個人道德的發展，常隨個人自我意識的發展而發展，由自我而擴大，道德觀念的範圍。個體的生長和環境的影響，是道德行爲形成的條件。據一般學者的分析，造成一種道德行爲首先須有高深的知識，做推理判斷的根據。蘇格拉底說：「知識就是道德。」西諺云：「大多數的苦難之來，由於無知者往往比由於惡意者爲多。」康德也說：「知識是一面鏡子，它照着我們的行爲。」的確，知識是很重要的，雖然我們也不能否認良好的習慣和堅强的意志力對於形成道德行爲的重要。</p>
<p>兒童</p>
<h3>怎樣對付兒童</h3>
<p>— 閒</p>
<p>兒童天眞，天賦有服從心，並且小心田裏，大致存有「大人總比我知道得多些」的下意識。所以對他們的訓導或規勉，儘可出之於和藹的態度，所謂諄諄善導，次用不到聲色俱厲，有時過多的責駡，反使他們成爲「頑皮」了，或甚至倔强！</p>
<p>小孩生性善玩，有時弄得手臉骯髒不堪，這並不是他的過失。你應當於事後爲他們洗淸潔，並吿訴他說，汚穢的東西不可入口，吃東西之前應先洗手，下次他就會自己去洗了！</p>
<p>不要當着人面前，指斥他的不是，這會失去他的自尊心。</p>
<p>兒童遇有不懂的事而詢問，應當細爲答復，解釋；但是學堂裏帶回來的功課或習題，切不可代做，以免養成依賴性。</p>
<p>小兒吃藥，不要騙他說這是甜的，這是敎他欺騙，並且下次就不靈了—不如好好的勸他，說這吃下去病立刻會好，身體不難過了，效果反要好些。</p>
<p>不要輕易允許孩子們的要求，允許了不可忘了給與，養成他們守約的習慣。</p>
<p>慈愛是好的，但是過多了就變成寵愛。</p>
<p>不要給孩子穿太華麗講究的衣服，這會養成他奢侈。</p>
<h3>孕婦排隊優先權</h3>
<p>— 歐麗</p>
<p>英國糧食部長史密斯爵士爲優待孕婦領取配給的食物起見，特規定孕婦的配給證上加印「排隊優先權」（Queue　Priority＇Please）字樣。孕婦得到這種配給證，在倫敦商店前排隊的時候，有排到前面去的權利。</p>
<p>這一類對孕婦的優待，我國似亦可倣行。</p>
<p>常識</p>
<h3>廢物利用</h3>
<p>— 劍如</p>
<p>當此一切物價高漲漫無止境的社會中，每個家庭總是憂慮着生活艱難，不時的打量着怎樣「開源」？怎樣「節流」？新生活運動的標語中有一條是：「勤以開源，儉以節流。」自然，能够利用廢物，積年累月的計算，他的數目倒也不小呢！現在我寫幾件可利用的廣物在後：</p>
<p>（一）肥皂頭　用剩的肥皂頭，把它收集起來，積得多了，以皂頭溶解在豬油中，加些食鹽，煎熬成糊狀，倒在模中，待凝結後，取出切開又成肥皂·</p>
<p>（二）破布　破衣服或零碎的布條，積存起來，可以理了紥成拖糞。市上所買的，也是破布做成的。</p>
<p>（三）　殼　義殼可作染料，只要把吃下的　　，加些綠　，放在鍋中，用水煎之，便可染元色衣料。</p>
<p>（四）舊皮芏底　破舊的皮鞋底，很可利用，把它改做女鞋底或小孩鞋底很適當。</p>
<p>（五）稻草灰　每天燒下的灰，看他一無所用，但是利用他來楷擦銅鍋器，能使舊的變成新的。或者泡成汁，用汁水來洗衣服，他的功用，可像肥皂一樣，可以去汚；又可作肥料。</p>
<p>女紅</p>
<h3>自製小斗蓬</h3>
<p>— 蒼梅</p>
<p>小孩穿衣裳是很浪費的。我們找件奮大衣，用點功夫就可改成一件合用而又經濟的時行服裝。現在很流行穿斗蓬，我覺得小女孩穿斗蓬很方便。因爲冬天穿了棉袍，如果再加大衣，必顯臃腫。斗蓬則簡便而瀟灑。</p>
<p>圖中的斗蓬尺寸（英尺），合適於五六歲小女孩穿的。</p>
<p>材料：最好是呢羢料。如果利用舊衣服，只要反一面熨平，做起來就同新的一樣。鑲　全身領圈及出手的材料，撮好用斜方格或棄色而鮮艷的。可以把一件平凡的暗色的料子襯托起來。至於襯裏等都可用舊的東西。</p>
<p>製法：依圖中尺寸剪裁，打摺及通合處先用針綫縫合，然然依照有綫點的地方機器軋好。前面分左右將兩塊聯和，然後縫成一斗蓬形，將帽子安好、做兩塊襯肩（縫成餃子狀，內襯棉花墊於肩頭處，然後將襯裏安好。（襯裏剪裁可以簡單些，後面可做一平塊剪，不必打褶；前面可將兩塊拼成一塊剪）。全身做完，最後鑲上滾邊。全身連　潦邊約八十二吋長，袖開口滾邊五吋長，領口處釘鈎扣，並釘兩圓扣，加一扣圈扣起，即成一簡便合用的斗蓬。諸位不妨先將大人的舊衣試做一件，尺寸可按小製大小加以放大或縮小。</p>
<p>好癖</p>
<h3>消耗生命的「麻將」</h3>
<p>— 溯因</p>
<p>「麻將」，是件消耗生命的玩意兒！因爲「時間是造成生命的東西」（富蘭克林語），所以消耗時間就是消耗生命，而搓麻將是最消耗時間的，因此也就最消耗生命的。</p>
<p>我國的社會上一直呈着這一種矛盾的現象，那就是「人無事做，事無人做」，搓麻將就是人無事做的現象最普遍的一種。當然，這種現象的發生不是由於眞的無事做，而是不知做與不肯做。這是一種很可怕的現象。明之亡於馬吊麻將的前身，這一回中國遭受了空前的刧難，麻將也未始無功。因爲搓麻將之風在過去數十年可說是猖獗已極，胡適之先生曾統計過，全國每日消耗於搓麻將的時間，至少有十六萬七千日！試想這許多的時開如果用來做了別種有益於社會，家庭或個人的事情，它的成就不是很可觀了嗎？積之一年，數十年，它的成就不更可驚了嗎？自然，這些成就的果積，就是社會的進步，國家的强盛。如今把這如許可貴的時間消耗在搓麻將上，所得到的結果當然是相反的，而國難的發生也就不是偶然的了。</p>
<p>然而更令人痛心的，在此由於盟邦的合作而獲得了抗戰勝利的今日，正當每一個國民都應該肩負起一份建國工作的時候，搓麻將之惡風依然普遍流行於上，中，下各社會階層中！</p>
<p>而且，搓麻將不僅是浪費時間而已，更會養成人的僥倖心，自私心，和影響親友間情感。更壞的是因患得患失，使人心理失常。當贏了的時候，得意忘形，想把儻來之財來作樂一下，於是吃，喝，玩種種惡習便開始造成了；若是輸了呢，便垂頭喪氣，藉端使性，寢食不安地的要想去「翻本」；幸而將本翻回，若從此洗手不幹，那還好，但由於他補償心理（補償一點精神上的損失）的作用，他不肯就此罷手，而想再贏一點；但如果又　了點，他會從此罷手嗎？不會的，因爲他又生了得隴望燭的心。這樣，輸了固想翻本，贏了又想再贏，循環不已，他永遠不能自拔了。這是從事任何種賭博的共同心理，固不祇搓麻將爲然。</p>
<p>可是這種傷神費時的玩意兒不但男人愛玩，而女人玩得更起勁，因爲男人總得出外做事，女人呢，有閒階級的太太，奶奶，小姐們，固然可以把全部家事交托給傭僕，把全副精神全部時間貢獻於搓麻將而不成問題，就是中下家庭中的主婦，沒有傭僕可交托她們的家務，孩子的，她們也會以極「經濟」的辦法來處理：她們會買些點心來省却一番舉炊的麻煩；會把骯髒的衣被堆積不先；讓室內的塵灰厚積起來不加掃除，什物凌亂不加整理、，讓孩子們在馬路上游蕩，衖堂裏打架，惡作劇，不加管束，敎育，而騰出時間來從事搓麻將。我眞有點不明自，「麻將」這東西竟會如此使人着魔！</p>
<p>但賭博之者，我相信什九都懂得，他們乃是明知而故犯，所以這不是甚麼言語文字的規勸所能奏效。這必須另找建設性的消遣與娛樂來取而代之。因爲我國人由於思想的不進步，敎育水準之低，一向缺乏良好的好癖，如歐美人所愛好的各種球戲，游泳，族行，讀書，集郵，秦樂之類；同時又因環境關係，正當的消遣與娛樂受到限制，如缺乏公園，運動塲，圖書館等以及各種業餘的團體組織。所以麻將一物便得時地之宜，而成了普遍的嗜好品。</p>
<p>筆者久以爲要革除家庭婦女搓麻將的惡風，必須靠團體的力量。最好是由每一里衖中的智識婦女領導組織一種國體，如聯誼社之類，以一里衖或一條衖裏的婦女爲組織對象——組織範圍不妨小，小則易於辦理。會所內備點書報雜誌，娛樂器具等，時常舉行演讀或座談和作家庭訪問，以灌輸婦女們以各種必需的知識，如家事，衛生，兒童心理及敎養，婦女自身的修養等等。有時相約作集體旅行或參觀，有時舉行有敎育意義的展覽，逢到節日更不妨開個游藝會，音樂會之類。總之，凡足以增進婦女們的智識，增加她們正當的興趣的，都可以推陳出新的來一下，藉以提高她們的智識水準，培養她們高尙的好癖，糾正她們不良的生活方式，而達到革除　麻將的惡風的目的。</p>

<h3>蘇聯的尿布問題</h3>
<p>— 蕭淑莊譯</p>
<p>我眞是喜不自勝，太太生了個兒子。</p>
<p>這個在產科醫院裏降生人世的小把幾，當他可以回家時，最需要的東西是什麼呢？顯然的，是尿布。</p>
<p>最先，產科醫院給寫了張證明書，證明孩子生下來是活的。</p>
<p>「你到婦女檢騐室去領取他的尿布呢，」他們這樣的告訴我。到了檢騐室，他們說：</p>
<p>「你得要有一張你現在往所的房東寫來的居住證明書；領尿布時還要有一張代領保證書」。</p>
<p>「誰來保證我呀」？我驚訝的問，「這個嬰兒嗎？」</p>
<p>「母親可以出代頒保證書，」這是他們的回答。</p>
<p>於是我跑去找房東，再跑回到產科醫院收集這些證明書。</p>
<p>我又回到檢騐室，這次三張證明書換來了一張新的證明書。承他們的慈悲吿訴我說：</p>
<p>「把它送到你太太做工的地方去吧。」</p>
<p>到了太太做工的地方，我的兒子就被登記上。現在，我備有了紀錄片，證明書等，我就到發配給證的分區辦審處去。在那裏，我領到一張領尿布的卡片。</p>
<p>我手裏舉起這張小小的綠色的卡片，禁不住想到：假若有人想出一人好主意，使尿布不至少尿布配給證—直接的就從產科醫院供給的話，那時這一批仁慈的先生們還有點什麼事情可做呢？</p>
<p>在我的兒子降世後第七天，他　上了新的屍布，就被許可出院了。出院時，他們遞給我一張小紙條，說：</p>
<p>「這兒是你領肥皂的證明書。」</p>
<p>小傢伙已經兩個多月了，那張領肥皂證明書方才變成一塊肥皂。它並沒有被　放　。這張證明書先跑到房東處，從那裏被指引到婦女檢騐室，再回到房東處。然後跑到母親做工處，從那裏到發配給證分區辦事處，從那裏父到父親做工處，然後又回到撥配給證分區辦事處，最後再回到產科醫院。</p>
<p>並不是這紙證明書。已會向這些地方跑來跑去，是做爸爸的陪它一齊去的。這就是爸爸們的用處。</p>
<p>在那證明收的反面，印有　樣的聲明：「肥皂配給證應直接由產科醫院內領取。配給證分區辦事處處長庫資奈左夫印。」就在這下面我們又看到「將此證明書交於領取其他配給證之　關，即可頓得肥皂配給證。（簽字，模糊不清）」</p>
<p>然而到底們領到了那塊肥皂不過我却保留了這張證明書。等到我的兒子長大成人能去做事時，我要把這小片紙頭給他看，並對他說，「孩子呀，把它撕了吧！記着，在你一生中，絕不要頒發這種的證書或是寫出這樣的聲明。你要待你的同胞們像人類呀！」</p>
<p>上文譯自一九四六年正月號讀者文摘，原著者　Yefirn　Urhunsky。抗戰期內，在淪陷區的同胞們都嘗盡了敵僞政府下配給制度的苦。爲了生活的壓迫，物價的高漲，不得不忍氣吞聲的被支使來支使去的這裏填張表格，那裏領張配給票，手續眞是繁多。做主婦的更是頭痛不盡，什麼米票，麵票，糖票，油票，煤球票，布票等等都要時時記得該物何時到何處去領取，又要擠又被軋，不是白跑就是花了錢領到些不能吃不能用不夠分兩的東西。讀了此文，使我十分同情這位蘇聯著者的經歷。</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>懷念</h3>
<p>— 淑儀</p>
<p>和孩子們生活在一起，眞是人生的樂事。望着他們天眞活潑的舉止，以及無所掛慮的臉龐，以乎使我年輕了不少。有時候，心中明明受了塵世間的擾攘，沉溺於愁悶的深淵中，可是一見到也門的親切可愛，就會烟消雲散的。跟他們天天共同學習，似乎自己又重返昔日的黃金時代。</p>
<p>在孩子們的心目中，我像是皇帝一樣的尊嚴。我的話就是孩子們的法律。他們的生活情感隨着我的意志而轉變，我像活在自已所造成的世界裏。雖然，過着　梗的孩子，常常竭思盡慮心緒不寗，不過事後，什麼都不在心上，正像在家裏同兄弟們生氣後的和解；要是結果能看見他們的行爲或學業漸漸向前的話，那末心中的愉澤眞無可言喩，會以這孩子格外的珍貴。</p>
<p>如今，病使我離開他們已快二年了；二年的隔閡更增依戀，我懷念着他們無一個，他們亦一定不會遺忘了我。要是將來身體和環境能應許的話，我還是願意再幹這舊業，和天眞的孩子們相處，過辛苦而溫馨的學校生活。</p>

        <h1>1946 - n59</h1>
<h3>Our Nation Has Expressed Its Basic Position: Northeast Clouds May Clear, Severity of Military Conflicts Also Diminished</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 27th] President Song, while passing through Hankou, told someone that the Northeast problem could be resolved soon, hoping that the nation would not worry too much.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] A qualified source told reporters that the heavily clouded Northeast sky should soon have the hope of clearing. Although President Chiang's meeting with Wedemeyer, Eisenhower's inspection of the Pacific coast, General Keelen's visit to China, and Marine Corps Commander Rocky's trip to Pearl Harbor all added to the sense of weight of the Northeast problem, practically speaking, the current situation is slightly better than before. (1) After this issue became more public, China's basic position and attitude were more easily recognized by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union may attach considerable importance to Chiang Ching-kuo's final proposal brought to Moscow. (2) The recently signed military reorganization plan, which includes the Northeast region, has greatly reduced the severity of military conflicts in the Northeast and has the potential for a fundamental solution. (3) Although the official authorities still suspect whether the Dongmeng (Eastern Mongolia) delegation arriving in Peiping has any international or party affiliation, their statement that they are seeking autonomy within the Republic of China has slightly calmed the hurricane brought about by the initial information obtained by the authorities. Therefore, the Northeast situation has the hope of becoming clearer. The spokesperson also told reporters that personnel from the Changchun Railway Company recently flew from Chongqing to Peiping and will transfer to Changchun in the next two days, which proves that the Northeast problem has not deteriorated to the extent it did on November 17th of last year. Zhang Jia'ao will come to Peiping soon to convey the central government's intentions and then transfer to the Northeast. Government officials all believe that Zhang Jia'ao's visit to the North will symbolize that the government has a solution for the Northeast. However, some also say that if the Northeast deteriorates to the point that a second Changchun evacuation is necessary, Zhang Jia'ao will still go to preside over the evacuation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 26th] The Northeast problem has now reached an extremely important stage. Although this is purely a diplomatic issue, some people often mix it with domestic politics, and the actions of these people often shift with diplomatic developments. The complexity of the problem lies here, and the danger also lies here. There are many Eighth Route Army soldiers in various parts of the Northeast. Some of them came from Shandong in recent months, and the rest were mostly formed locally. Their strength is greatest in the east, and they are also scattered along the Changchun Railway line. The train from Pan Kai to Dalian has checkpoints of the Eighth Route Army just ten miles outside of Shenyang, inspecting passengers in the train. Trains traveling between Shenyang and Changchun are often inspected in the Tie Ling area. The checkpoint between Changchun and Harbin is in Dehui. Their relationship with the Soviet army seems superficially non-interfering, but they are sometimes driven away by the Soviet army. Taking the takeover of Jiutai County as an example, when the county magistrate Qiao Guifang first went to take over, the local Eighth Route Army and the Soviet army were mixed together. The Soviet city defense commander suggested that Qiao negotiate with the Eighth Route Army. Qiao insisted on taking over from the Soviet army, so he returned without any result. When he took over again, the Soviet army had ordered the Eighth Route Army to withdraw in advance. Yang Hualei, the Eighth Route Army county magistrate, left a letter to Qiao, saying that the retreat was based on the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference and was by no means a sign of weakness. Later, when Qiao took over the Yingchengzi coal mine in the county, the Soviet commander even forced the Eighth Route Army to withdraw more than 50 kilometers away and set a deadline of March 1st. The Eighth Route Army had no objections, but when the National Army advanced, they did not hesitate to fight to the death to block them. Currently, the war is fierce in the Faku area northwest of Shenyang, and both sides have casualties. An encounter battle also occurred once in Nong'an County after the takeover. Also, in the provinces and counties where the Eighth Route Army is located, administrative organizations have now been established. It is said that the administrative heads are all democratically elected, and they also plan to invite Kuomintang members to participate to form a joint system. It is said that this is based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but they rarely mention the decision to exclude the Northeast. These things have mostly happened recently. The presence of the Eighth Route Army within the Northeast is also a matter of the past six months. When the takeover personnel arrived here last year, it was still brewing, but now it is everywhere, and the speed of development is surprising. It is generally believed that the existence of these facts has indeed added many difficulties to diplomacy. However, if diplomacy and domestic politics are completely separated, the solution would be very easy. The focus of the current problem is still on diplomacy, but this diplomacy must be conducted openly, reversing the past practice of doing things secretly. It is believed that if diplomatic activities here had taken an open approach from the beginning, the situation would not have become so complicated today. Also, regarding the Fushun incident, it has never been published here, and most people are unaware of this tragic case, which is most likely to lead to the misunderstanding that the people's hearts are dead. According to the reporter's observation, although the current Northeast problem is extremely serious, if we accept past experiences and find a good solution, it is not impossible to immediately break the deadlock. However, the issue of cleaning up after this deadlock is broken, especially the issue of the people who will be engaged in this cleanup work, must be reconsidered.</p>
<h3>Statement by Chief of Staff of Soviet Army in Changchun: Withdrawal Work is in Progress, Expected to be Completed Before US Troops Leave China</h3>
<p>[TASS, Changchun, 26th] Lieutenant General Doroshenko, Chief of Staff of Marshal Malinovsky, held a press conference today and issued the following statement: "In view of the various inaccurate reports in Chinese and foreign newspapers that distort the true situation of the Soviet army's delayed withdrawal from the Northeast, Marshal Malinovsky's command intends to clarify this situation." "The withdrawal of the Soviet army began in November 1945, but was temporarily suspended until February 1st due to the first and second requests of the Chinese government. On January 15, 1946, the Soviet army resumed its withdrawal, which is still in progress, and a considerable number of Soviet troops have already left the Northeast." "However, the reason why the withdrawal of the Soviet army has been slightly delayed in progress is because the Chinese government's troops have been unusually slow to move into the areas left by the Soviet army, resulting in the Soviet army not knowing to whom to hand over the withdrawn land in many cases. On this point, one thing is worth noting, namely that last autumn, the Chinese government protested to the Soviet command more than once, saying that the Soviet army withdrew before the Chinese government's troops arrived." "The Soviet army command had to pay attention to this situation. In addition, it must be firmly remembered that a large part of the railways and vehicles in the Northeast have been destroyed by the Japanese army that was defeated by the Red Army. The lack of coal in the Northeast and the winter conditions have caused serious obstacles to normal railway transportation on the whole." "Finally, along the transportation routes, especially along the railway lines, bandits formed by the remnants of the Japanese puppet army continue to be active and carry out attacks, thereby hindering the free movement of the Soviet army." "The Soviet command in the Northeast expects to complete the withdrawal of the Soviet army before the US military command can withdraw US troops from China, or in any case, no later than this time. Therefore, all the news carried by some Chinese and foreign newspapers that the Soviet army deliberately delayed its withdrawal from the Northeast are slanders and fabrications by anti-Soviet, reactionary, and anti-democratic elements, whose purpose is to shake the trust and goodwill of the Chinese people towards the Red Army, which has liberated them from the enslavement of Japanese imperialism in Manchuria."</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Has No Privilege to Transport Industrial Equipment in the Northeast, US Secretary of State Denies Any Agreement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] US Secretary of State Byrnes (see picture) denied at a press conference this afternoon that any tripartite agreement stipulated that the Soviet Union could take away machinery or factory equipment in Northeast China. A reporter asked if the Secretary of State knew of any group of powers that wanted to undermine the solidarity of the four powers. He replied solemnly that the four powers could continue to cooperate in peacetime as they did in wartime.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 26th] Secretary of State Byrnes declared at a press conference today that he had not received any reports of the withdrawal of Soviet occupation forces from Manchuria. He made this statement in response to a reporter's question, citing news from London that Moscow Radio broadcast that most of the Soviet occupation forces in Manchuria had withdrawn. A reporter said that the Soviet commander in Shenyang had said that the Red Army had removed heavy industrial equipment from dozens of factories in Shenyang based on the agreement of the Big Three. The reporter then asked if there was such an agreement. Byrnes replied that to his knowledge, there was no such agreement. Another reporter asked whether the Chinese side had notified the US government about the Soviet army's transportation of materials. He replied no. Byrnes further denied that the US government had obtained any reports from its own institutions or from the Chinese and Soviet sides that the Soviet Union had requested commercial privileges in Manchuria other than the agreements on railways and the two ports of Lushun and Dalian.</p>
<h3>US Has Agreed to New Soviet Annexed Territory</h3>
<p>A reporter asked the Secretary of State whether the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin Island into its territory violated the so-called method that all former enemy territories should be handled at the peace conference rather than by unilateral action. Also, whether this could be a precedent for the United States to obtain fortified bases in the Pacific. Byrnes replied that, as he said, according to international law, all territorial concessions should be made by treaty. If, according to international law, a certain land is to be recognized by people, then only the treaty procedure can be followed, either voluntarily or passively, as in the case of defeated countries. Byrnes replied to a reporter's question as to whether he did not intend to recognize the above-mentioned areas ceded to the Soviet Union unless a treaty was signed. Byrnes said that the United States is bound by the agreement and has agreed to support the transfer of the land to the Soviet Union. When the treaty is concluded in the future, he will advocate that the United States should fulfill its promise and incorporate the clause that the above-mentioned land is included in the Soviet Union's territory into the treaty. A reporter asked what would happen if someone raised an objection during the negotiation and conclusion of the treaty. Byrnes replied that the steps to be taken at that time could be decided.</p>
<h3>Foreign Press Conference: Minister Wu Answers Questions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] The foreign press conference was held at 3:00 PM today, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen and Director He Fengshan. The main Q&amp;A is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) Soviet news broadcasts said that the recent student protests in Chongqing against the Yalta Secret Agreement and the Soviet policy towards the Northeast were assisted or organized by the Chinese government. Please state the official attitude of China.</p>
<p>(Answer) The government has never assisted or organized student protests. On the contrary, the government has used various methods to dissuade them. Anyone who has witnessed the student protests in Chongqing must be able to feel that they are completely spontaneous, and the students are all there. You can go and ask them in person.</p>
<p>(Question) Please provide accurate details on the results of the recent military conference held in Nanjing.</p>
<p>(Answer) There were only two items on the agenda at this conference. Regarding the reorganization of the troops, it was decided to reorganize the existing 273 divisions into 90 divisions. This adjustment is expected to be completed by the end of May. After the downsizing, a unified organization will be completed. This work will take about six months. In addition, the employment and placement of the surplus officers and soldiers after the reorganization was discussed.</p>
<p>(Question) Foreign Minister Wang previously made inquiries to the Soviet side regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast. Has the Chinese government received a reply?</p>
<p>(Answer) The government has not received a reply to date.</p>
<p>(Question) Did Ambassador to the Soviet Union Fu Bingchang bring back a statement of the Soviet side's attitude when he returned to Chongqing?</p>
<p>(Answer) Ambassador Fu left Moscow weeks ago to go to the UK to attend the United Nations General Assembly. This time, he returned directly from London to Chongqing, so he did not bring back any documents.</p>
<h3>Resident Committee of the National Political Council: Temporary Secret Meeting, Requesting Foreign Minister Wang to Attend and Report</h3>

<h3>Gold Prices in Nanjing and Shanghai Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Gold prices in Nanjing continued to fall this afternoon due to weak prices reported in Shanghai, with a drop of 140,000 yuan at the start of trading.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 27th] Today, the opening price for gold factory bars was 142,000 yuan in the morning, and the closing price was 140,000 yuan. The closing price for cast bars was 137,000 yuan. The highest price for US dollars was 2,040 yuan, and the closing price was 2,020 yuan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 27th] The authorities in Beiping today ordered a halt to trading in gold and silver bars. Military police were ordered to go to registered and black market businesses to remove telephones.</p>
<p>[Local News] The market prices for gold, US dollars, securities, etc. in this city continued to decline yesterday. The price of gold once fell to 138,000 yuan, and the US dollar fell even more sharply, once reaching a low of 2,070 yuan. Other bond and stock markets were all sluggish and unable to rise. According to financial sources, the black market gold price had previously risen to a peak of 75 yuan per US dollar, equivalent to one tael of gold. According to today's market price, it has fallen to 66 yuan and 30 cents equivalent to one tael. However, the official price of American gold is only 35 US dollars per tael. Although there are also slight signs of a black market, the difference is not very large. Therefore, the black market gold price in this city is much higher than the American market. If the price of US dollars continues to fall or gradually stabilizes in the future, then the price of gold will also gradually fall.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 26th] Food prices in Hankou have fallen back, with a drop of about 5,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight). The municipal government has also invited relevant agencies to jointly form a Civil Food Regulation Committee to suppress the rising prices.</p>
<h3>President Song Arrives in Shanghai from Hankou, Will Preside Over Matters Regarding the Opening of the Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Premier Song Ziwen, accompanied by his wife Madame Zhang Leyi, secretary Xu Shixuan, Zhu Zhongdao, and others, took a plane from Hankou at around 9:00 AM yesterday and continued flying east, arriving in Shanghai at 12:30 PM. Also accompanying him were Qian Changzhao, vice chairman of the Resources Commission, and Liu Gongyun, director of the Bureau for the Management of Enemy and Puppet Property. President Song then drove to the temporary Shanghai office of the Executive Yuan in the Bank of China building on the Bund at 3:20 PM to work. He successively met with Chen Yi, the administrative governor of Taiwan Province, and Li Zeyi, the advisor to the governor's office, and Song Hanzhang, the general manager of the Bank of China. It is heard that President Song's visit to Shanghai is to preside over the opening of the foreign exchange market. He will also instruct on the procedures for the Central Bank's management of foreign exchange trading quotations, etc., with the aim of stabilizing finance and stabilizing prices. Furthermore, President Song's stay in Shanghai will not be too long. He may return to Chongqing soon after the foreign exchange market procedures are deployed to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. Also, the newly appointed Governor of the Central Bank, Bei Zuyi, was originally scheduled to fly from Chongqing to Shanghai yesterday to take office, but was prevented by the weather and was unable to make the trip. He should arrive in Shanghai within a day or two.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 27th] President Song and his wife and a party of more than ten people flew from Chongqing to Shanghai yesterday, arriving in Wuhan at around 6:00 PM. Due to the weather, they landed here. Few people knew about it beforehand. After staying at the Bank of China, they met with Chairman Wang, Deputy Governor Guo, Mayor Xu, etc. Director Cheng of the Xingying also went to pay his respects. Song said that after the opening of the foreign exchange market, gold prices in Chongqing have fallen. The government will adopt effective measures to stabilize finance, and gold prices will continue to fall in the future. Regarding food, UNRRA food will be transported to Hankou in large quantities, and the rising prices will definitely be suppressed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing and Shanghai was previously approved by the Ministry of Finance to end operations at the end of this month. Now, because the financial affairs in Nanjing and Shanghai have not been completed, the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed to extend the term by two months, which will be extended to the end of April this year.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Firms to Begin Registration on Monday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] This reporter visited the relevant financial authorities yesterday and learned that the Central Bank in this city has formally received instructions on the plan to open the foreign exchange market and the provisional measures for the management of foreign exchange. It is now actively preparing various procedures to prepare for the foreign exchange listing on March 4th (Monday) as scheduled. As for the firms engaged in foreign exchange business, in addition to a number of "designated banks" that have yet to be designated and announced, other banks, silver firms, money houses, travel agencies, and brokers that have been approved to operate must go through application procedures. The application forms required are divided into two types: firms and brokers, and are currently being printed and will begin accepting applications for registration from next week, with a deadline of 15 days. If approved after review, a permit to operate will be issued as proof of business.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 26th] It is reported that China's move to stabilize the value of legal tender may be related to negotiations with the US Export-Import Bank for a large loan to develop China's export trade. Unofficial rumors here say that the new exchange rate may be 1,000 yuan of legal tender to 1 US dollar.</p>
<h3>Importers and Exporters Expressed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The government's announcement of opening the foreign exchange market and abolishing the official exchange rate has aroused close reaction in the financial circles here. According to an analysis by a certain financial authority, this extraordinary measure by the authorities will help to stabilize prices. In the future, the rise and fall of foreign exchange prices will depend on imports and exports. However, international traders will feel threatened after the abolition of the official exchange rate, so there may be some impact on foreign trade.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Importers and exporters in this city are closely watching the foreign exchange listing next Monday. A senior official of Jardine Matheson told reporters yesterday that he firmly believes that their business is expected to gradually return to normal thereafter, but he still hopes that the difference between the government's buying and selling prices of foreign exchange will not be too large. He said that even under the current regulations, exporters already feel quite troubled, because after they advance a large amount of cash to purchase goods, they must be submitted to the Commodity Inspection Bureau for inspection, and this work takes a lot of time. After the inspection is completed, a price is quoted to a foreign country by telegram. After the reply is received, they can go to the bank designated to operate foreign exchange to request a certificate based on the telegram, and then declare it for export. The interest lost during this period is already considerable. If a very large discount is given when the price is settled after receiving foreign exchange, the profit of the exporter will be even smaller. His hope is that this difference will not exceed 10%.</p>
<h3>Exchange Between Areas Inside and Outside the Pass Has Been Opened</h3>

<h3>Spanish Issue Serious: U.S. Memorandum to Britain Says Franco Regime Must End, Britain Disapproves of French Actions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: The British government today received a memorandum from Washington stating: The Spanish Franco regime must be ended immediately. The British government is currently considering this memorandum. In addition, the British Trades Union Congress today issued a declaration requesting Britain and the United States to sever diplomatic relations with the Spanish Franco regime.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 27th] 30,000 French people gathered here today in Valletrom, and with angry emotions, burned the portrait of Spanish dictator Franco, and cheered the declaration of the blockade of the French-Spanish border. The masses demanded a complete severance of diplomatic relations with Spain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The French government decided yesterday to close the border between France and Spain starting next Friday, and sent a new memorandum to Britain and the United States, reiterating the French view that the current situation in Spain "endangers international security." At the same time, the British government urgently telegraphed Sir Mallet, the British ambassador to Spain, instructing him to investigate in detail the execution of ten Spanish Republicans in Madrid last week.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 27th] The French government decided today that if the United States and Britain still intend to maintain economic and diplomatic relations with the Spanish Franco government, it is prepared to submit the French opposition to the Franco regime to the United Nations Security Council for discussion. It is expected that French Foreign Minister Jushcher will ask Britain and the United States to support France on the diplomatic front and jointly sever all relations with Spain. In addition, according to news from Hendaye: It is rumored that the Spanish authorities have already blocked the French border this morning, 48 hours earlier than the time France announced the blockade. The French Cabinet has now decided to completely sever all rail, road, postal, and telecommunications traffic between France and Spain from midnight on March 1st, coinciding with the expiration of the trade agreement signed between France and Spain last September.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office stated today that it does not approve of the French government's order to close the French-Spanish border. It is said that such incidents may prolong Franco's regime, making the Spanish head of state a "national hero" rather than a traitor. However, Britain also hates Franco and urgently hopes that a government supported by the people will emerge in Spain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] Paris Radio stated that less than twelve hours after the French Cabinet decided to block the French-Spanish border, the West immediately ordered Spanish troops on the Spanish-French border not to go on leave, but this news has not yet been confirmed by Westerners. The French Cabinet re-deliberated yesterday and sent another message to the British and American governments, stating that France believes that the current situation in Spain constitutes a condition that endangers international security.</p>
<p>[United Press, Madrid, 27th] Spanish newspapers today published for the first time detailed news of the French government's decision to block the French-Spanish border and efforts to urge Britain and the United States to sever relations with Spain, and published lengthy commentaries, denouncing the French Communist Party and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>First Meeting of the Far Eastern Commission: McCoy Elected Chairman, Secretariat Organized to Plan Commission Work, Britain Appoints Australian as Representative to Control Japan</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 26th] The Far Eastern Commission held its first meeting today in the dining room of the former Japanese Embassy, ​​attended by representatives from eleven countries: the United States, China, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, India, New Zealand, and the Philippines. Secretary of State Byrnes of the United States delivered the opening speech (see yesterday's newspaper). Subsequently, US representative Lieutenant General McCoy was unanimously elected as the permanent chairman of the commission, and former US Ambassador to China Johnson was the secretary-general of the commission. The agenda of the meeting included certificates of accreditation, commission membership, election of the chairman and secretary-general, organization of the secretariat and planning of the commission's work, reporting on the visit to Japan, and other informal matters.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The Far Eastern Commission held its first meeting yesterday and passed a proposal by Indian Commissioner Gedgebay to establish a Steering Committee organized by British representative Sanson, Indian representative Gedgebay, and Soviet representative Novikov so that the trial of Japanese war criminals can proceed as soon as possible. US Secretary of State Byrnes read out at the meeting the resolutions of the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference on the Far Eastern Commission. Australian representative Eggleston first protested, believing that it could not be finalized immediately without soliciting the opinions of all commissioners. New Zealand representative Beren-Tait also opposed the veto power of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Philippine representative Romulo also protested because it did not involve Southeast Asia and Vietnam. Chairman McCoy believes the committee can consider any events it chooses, but there is a considerable difference between discussion and action. Yesterday's meeting was held in the dining room of the former Japanese Embassy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 27th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt announced yesterday that Paul, a former lecturer in political economy and Australian representative to the San Francisco Conference, has been appointed as the representative of the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and India to participate in the Four-Power Control Commission for Japan. The fact that this position is held by an Australian proves that Britain and other countries of the Commonwealth have been willing to increase Australia's position in the Pacific region and also proves the cooperation between the British countries. According to the Four-Power Commission, it is responsible for advisory duties when MacArthur implements the instructions formulated by the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission.</p>
<h3>China and Britain Trade Relations: Ushering in a New Era</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] Minister of Commerce Cripps stated yesterday at the dinner of the Central Trade Association that commercial relations between China and Britain have begun to enter a new stage.

Since the war, most restrictions have been lifted. During the transition period, although we cannot offer long-term loans, we can only exchange exports for imports. However, we believe that once shipping tonnage recovers, we can export to China as much as possible, and Chinese goods can also be shipped to Britain in a steady stream. Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, also declared that China will purchase ships, railway locomotives, steel, telephones, and electrical materials from Britain.</p>

<h3>Reader Opinions - After Reading "How to Raise Funds for Industrial Construction"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yushan</p>
<p>Since the end of the war, all countries have been striving for reconstruction. China, as an industrially backward country, feels particularly eager for this reconstruction endeavor. We deeply hope that China can quickly move towards industrialization in terms of economic construction. A country's industrial construction certainly requires various necessary basic conditions, but raising funds is of paramount importance. Recently, Mr. Zhao Tongyun's article "How to Raise Funds for Industrial Construction" (see this newspaper on the 17th of this month) suggested establishing a China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Company. This is because China's industrial construction requires a very large quantity of machinery, materials, and manpower. The long-term capital required cannot be supplied by ordinary banking organizations. At the same time, the exchange rate of our country is not easy to determine for the time being. It is not easy for manufacturers to settle the foreign exchange needed to order equipment from abroad. Therefore, it is proposed to establish a China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Company, jointly invested by national banks and major commercial banks, trust companies, insurance companies, etc., with US$500 million and CN$5 billion to serve as a central financial institution to support industrial recovery. The proposed company is not a creative suggestion, as all industrially advanced countries in Europe and America have established such institutions. China's industrial construction is still in its infancy, so there is a more urgent need for a central financial institution to support industrial recovery. Realizing this will bring at least the following benefits:</p>
<p>(1) Solving the Capital Needed for Industrial Construction: China is short of capital, and it is most difficult to raise long-term and medium-term capital for industrial construction. If a central financial institution can coordinate the supply for rational and effective use, this difficulty can be solved.</p>
<p>(2) Attracting Foreign Investment for Beneficial Production: The amount of foreign investment in China is very large, but most of it is used for non-productive purposes, so it not only does not benefit China's economic development but also puts China in a more disadvantageous position in terms of politics and economy. The establishment of the China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Company can, on the one hand, guide foreign investment to be absolutely used for productive construction projects; at the same time, it can use the power of the government to strengthen the company's credit abroad, and the amount and scope of foreign capital utilization will become more extensive.</p>
<p>(3) Qualitative Transformation of Imports: Since the Reconstruction Industrial Finance Company acts as an agent for manufacturers to order materials needed for industrial construction from foreign countries, the import of machinery and raw materials will greatly increase. This qualitative transformation of imported commodities will mark a new era in China's history of international trade, and its benefit to the country's economic prosperity is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>(4) Strengthening the Power to Stabilize Foreign Exchange: The amount of gold, foreign currency bonds, and foreign exchange held by the people of our country is very large. For individuals, this type of holding only serves the purpose of maintaining purchasing power; for the entire country, this huge amount of gold does not contribute to the country's production in any way. Now that there is a central financial institution for industrial recovery, the gold, foreign currency bonds, and foreign exchange held by the people can be used rationally and effectively.</p>
<p>We believe that the proposal to establish a China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Company has an inevitable value in the process of completing the great economic construction of industrialization. However, China has a vast territory, and the types and scope of various industrial constructions are extremely broad. Whether the use of US$500 million and CN$5 billion can complete this great cause for generations is questionable, so the amount of capital really needs to be reconsidered.</p>
<p>During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the people's livelihood was impoverished. Since the victory, all production endeavors have fallen into a state of stagnation. We deeply feel that the handling of enemy and puppet property should not be solely aimed at fiscal revenue but should be based on maintaining and increasing production. "Killing the chicken to get the eggs" should not be adopted by the wise. We sincerely hope that the financial authorities will take a long-term perspective and start with immediate action, decisively breaking the chain of the vicious circle. Only in this way can the establishment of the China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Company promote industrial construction and achieve the actual effect of increasing production.</p>
<h3>Special Article: Countermeasures to Stabilize Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>— Xu Erxin</p>
<p>Since the victory of peace, commodity prices in various places have continued to rise, especially after the opening of the market near the Lunar New Year, the price increase has become more severe, like wildfire. All those who hold gold, foreign currency, stocks, and various goods have obtained windfall profits. Those with idle funds have flocked to banks to withdraw cash and purchase gold, banknotes, and materials, competing with each other. The interest rate has soared to more than two, people are in a state of panic, and society is showing extreme unrest. The common people are groaning and haggard, and their lives are extremely painful. President Chiang, while in Hangzhou, heard the news and specially went to Shanghai to summon important figures in the financial and industrial circles, instructing them on countermeasures to suppress prices. It can be seen that although the President is busy with myriad affairs, he is always concerned about the people's suffering. At this time of high commodity prices, enlightened people in Shanghai suggested that the government's existing gold should be sold publicly as much as possible to suppress gold prices and stabilize commodity prices. Others advocated that gold should be recovered by the state so that gold cannot cause trouble and lose its role in leading commodity prices. In fact, rising commodity prices have natural and man-made causes, involving political, financial, monetary, fiscal, production, consumption, transportation, and speculative manipulation issues. Rising gold prices may stimulate rising commodity prices, but it cannot be said that gold prices have a definite and inevitable role in leading general commodity prices. At present, the market is flooded with idle funds, with no proper place to go. They are overflowing everywhere, in huge amounts. Selling the government's existing gold is like a drop in the bucket and is difficult to sustain. If the gold runs out and the policy is exhausted, the gold price will jump wildly, and the phenomenon that occurred when Chongqing stopped listing prices will not be difficult to repeat. Although there are no accurate statistics on the gold owned by the people in various places, it is estimated that the quantity must be very large. If the government recovers gold for the state, even if part of its price is matched with a public price and part is given in cash, the issuance of this huge amount of banknotes will inevitably increase the degree of commodity price increases. Moreover, US dollars can also replace gold and play a role in leading commodity prices. The theory of recovering gold for the state is not yet possible to implement at present, and can only be regarded as a way to stabilize finance, and cannot be used as a good countermeasure to stop the current extremely complex commodity price problem. The author believes that the current rise in commodity prices is due to the expansion of the amount of currency in circulation, the lack of materials, and the lack of confidence of the people in legal currency.</p>
<p>Therefore, to suppress and stabilize commodity prices, the government and all the people must make concerted and joint efforts in the entire aspect of "two natural causes" that cause rising commodity prices, and in all three aspects, taking both radical and curative measures. Otherwise, only partial handling, treating the head when it hurts, and treating the foot when it hurts, or the government shifting the blame to the common people, or the people criticizing the government, the result will be "propping up the east while the west falls," or even no effect at all. The author has held this view very early, and now will reiterate these implementation countermeasures separately below:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the "currency" aspect: (1) Contracting currency circulation. At present, the central bank, although it cannot adopt policies such as raising the discount rate and open market operations to contract currency circulation, the central bank is in the position of "bank of banks," and the issuance of banknotes has a trend of centralization. In the future, it must be cautious about lending to other banks, and there should also be considerable restrictions on lending to the government, so as to ensure that more is collected and less is released. The adjustment of the head positions of silver and money shops should be strictly supervised, and all loans of various banks, shops, credit mortgages, etc., should be investigated at any time to prevent them from being used for speculation. (2) Rectifying various tax revenues to make them abundant, especially the direct taxes, which must be seriously rectified to transfer the purchasing power of the people. The tax package system must be absolutely prohibited, and corruption must be strictly eliminated to ensure that every penny goes to the public. (3) Abolishing redundant agencies and adjusting institutions at all levels to rationalize them. Reducing redundant personnel and focusing on administrative efficiency. Temporarily adopting a policy of "recuperating with the people," stopping all non-urgent matters, and striving to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure. (4) Issuing new public bonds or temporary treasury bills, forcing wealthy households to underwrite. (5) Conducting wealth registration, all kinds of tangible and intangible wealth must be registered uniformly, and the account name should be limited to the name on the national identity card issued as stipulated by the Household Registration Law, and there must be no aliases. This wealth registration can be a great help in rectifying direct taxes, and can also be used as a basis for raising public bonds, in line with the principle of ability to bear taxes. (6) Receiving enemy and puppet factories in various places, issuing and selling stocks according to their assets. Quickly establishing a legitimate securities trading market, guiding idle funds to industrial and commercial enterprises, and incorporating them into the right track. (7) Promoting savings or forcing national savings, or holding prize-winning savings. (8) Increasing the interest rate on savings deposits, restricting credit current deposits, and investigating their whereabouts at any time to prevent idle funds from causing trouble. (9) Disbanding the army and adopting the principle of elite troops, and all officers and soldiers who are removed from the establishment should engage in land reclamation and industry and agriculture to increase production. (10) For enterprises that are monopolistic and cannot be organized by private individuals, they should be operated by the state or jointly operated by the government and businesses, so that the income can subsidize the insufficiency of the national treasury, or absorb a part of private idle funds.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the "material" aspect: (1) Restoring water and land transportation, and implementing road construction and river dredging projects, increasing cargo ships and vehicles to facilitate the transportation of goods. (2) Public and private factories must all start work within a time limit, and the original enemy and puppet factories must continue to be responsible for the use of Japanese technicians. (3) Encouraging private investment in various enterprises and providing guarantees of principal and interest. (4) Labor and management should adopt the principle of coordination, and political strikes and slowdowns should be strictly prohibited. (5) Borrowing loans from foreign countries and supplying appropriate amounts of foreign exchange to various industries to purchase the necessary raw materials and parts to expand production. (6) Selling the materials in the confiscated enemy and puppet warehouses universally and at low prices, and preventing good merchants from monopolizing and profiting. (7) Fully transporting coal and providing low-cost electricity. (8) Strictly prohibiting similar transit taxes in various places, and implementing the elimination of all kinds of exorbitant taxes.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding the "people" aspect: (1) Stabilizing people's minds and arousing the people's confidence in legal currency, breaking their concept of valuing goods and devaluing currency, must be achieved by the national people with the spirit of "fathers teaching their sons and brothers encouraging their brothers," and concerted and joint efforts to enhance the credit of legal currency and increase its value. (The issuance of more currency can indeed cause commodity prices to rise, but the accelerated circulation of currency is likely to promote commodity price increases. At present, people are throwing out legal currency and rushing to buy goods, and the circulation of legal currency is very fast. Even if currency circulation is contracted, the production of materials is increased, and implementation can be effective, the general public still holds the concept of devaluing legal currency, and the price of goods must still rise. Therefore, enhancing confidence in legal currency is a necessary condition for increasing the value of legal currency.) (2) Suppressing speculation, such as strictly prohibiting illegal buying and selling on the black market, inspecting warehouse materials, registering, investigating the whereabouts of bills, investigating the sources of relevant financial rumors, and punishing speculative and manipulative merchants, but these passive measures can only have a temporary effect. (3) Domestic peace and unity, and improving politics, so that the people develop support and respect for the government, thereby extending to cherishing legal currency and believing in legal currency. (4) Before the government authorities can clearly declare financial policies (such as the determination of exchange rates), they should be cautious in their statements, and should not make statements that are inconsistent before and after, or deny them afterwards, so that speculators can speculate on the intentions, and take the opportunity to create rumors, and seek opportunities to speculate and profit. (5) Advocating frugality, practicing hard work and endurance, so as to avoid waste of materials.</p>
<p>All the above-mentioned implementation countermeasures, although humble, are not very high-minded. If the government and the people of the whole country jointly rise up and implement them separately, the problem of rising commodity prices will not be difficult to solve. Once commodity prices can gradually fall and the value of the currency is stabilized, people's livelihood will be stabilized. Then, the issuance of the so-called "Sun banknotes" would be an unnecessary act of meddling. May the people of the country unanimously support the National Government, cherish and believe in the legal currency issued by the National Government, so that its value is permanently stable, commodity prices do not fluctuate, and we can share a happy life. Those who do not hesitate to undermine the value of legal currency, shake confidence in legal currency, and attempt to obtain windfall profits due to the rise in commodity prices should be regarded as public enemies of the people.</p>

<h3>The Industrial and Commercial Circles Telegraph the Second Plenary Session — Opposing the Specialization of the Northeast - Emergency Measures Should Be Taken for the Economic Crisis - Efforts Should Be Made to Save the Wild Wave of Commodity Prices - Presenting Three Points of Opinion</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held a welcome reception for Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau at the Great Eastern Restaurant, and discussed important current economic and diplomatic issues. Representatives from various industry associations, such as Luo Qinghua, Jin Lan'ku, Li Shuxiong, Xu Xiaochu, and more than 300 others attended. First, Chairman Luo Qinghua delivered a speech. After Director Wu Kaixian reported on the latest industrial and commercial administrative facilities, it was unanimously passed that the chamber and the 89 industry associations present would jointly telegraph the Second Plenary Session (1) to resolutely oppose the specialization of the Northeast, and requested to take practical and effective emergency measures with swift and decisive means, and (2) to stabilize commodity prices and prevent the economic crisis. The original text of the telegram reads: "To the honorable members of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Chongqing: In recent days, the wild wave of commodity prices has fluctuated across the country, and the people are frightened to the extreme. Incidents of slowdowns and strikes in various places have echoed each other, interacting with commodity price fluctuations, and the economic crisis affects social order. The associations, etc., are alarmed by this situation and feel uneasy. We hereby present three points of humble opinion, sincerely requesting the Honorable Assembly to take practical and effective emergency measures with swift and decisive means. First, all the enemy and puppet materials that have been received have been going on for half a year. In Shanghai alone, there are more than 2,000 sealed warehouses, and there is still no way to deal with them. The reasons are nothing more than that those above deliberately wait for prices to rise, using it as an unreasonable supplement to the national treasury, while those below try to delay the time, using it to manipulate things and maintain their own positions. As a result, materials are moldy, lost, and leaked, and various malpractices have emerged. All these phenomena fully expose the incompetence of the receiving personnel and the dereliction of duty of the management personnel. It should be strictly ordered to investigate and deal with all of them before the end of March, either returning them to the original owners or selling them publicly at low prices to suppress commodity prices. Second, the receiving of enemy and puppet factories should be strictly ordered to immediately investigate the actual situation. If any of them are indeed forcibly occupied by the enemy and puppets, they should be returned to the original owners to take over. Those that are indeed enemy and puppet property should be given priority to be leased or resold to the industrial circles that have suffered losses due to the War of Resistance in the front and rear, and they should be ordered to start work and increase production within a time limit. The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau should be ordered to complete and end it before the end of March. Third, opposing disguised state-owned companies competing with the people for profit, monopolizing and manipulating, tracking the black market, stimulating commodity prices, and creating the main factors of today's skyrocketing commodity prices and social unrest, should be strictly corrected to appease people's hearts. And with the means of cutting a knot of tangled hemp with a quick knife, the enemy and puppet yarn and cloth it receives should be publicly sold in large quantities at low prices as stated in the first point, and the factories it receives should be returned to the original owners or leased and sold to the industrial circles to start work as stated in the second point. As for this type of disguised state-owned company itself, it should be closed immediately to save public funds. The above-mentioned points are earnestly requested to be adopted quickly and implemented urgently. The future of the country deeply relies on it. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry, Paper Industry, Woolen Fabric Industry, Xinle Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, and other 89 industry associations kowtow and are grateful."</p>
<h3>Sending Experts to Taiwan to Produce High-Quality Silkworm Eggs</h3>
<p>"This newspaper reports" Ge Jingzhong, the general manager of the China Silk Company, flew to Taiwan to discuss mulberry seedlings and silkworm eggs. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his mission. The reporter made a special visit to inquire about the trip to Taiwan. Mr. Ge said: "Taiwan has a warm climate and is an ideal area for silkworm rearing. The company has agreed with the Taiwan Chief Executive Office to send four or five breeding technicians to cooperate in breeding, about 20,000 sheets, to meet the needs of breeding grounds in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. They will be shipped around mid-April." In addition, it is also planned to cooperate in promoting the silkworm and mulberry industry. It is also said that to remedy the losses in the silkworm area during the war, the Allied authorities in Tokyo have been contacted repeatedly. Now, 800,000 mulberry seedlings have been shipped from Japan, and 1 million seedlings are being shipped. There are also 300,000 sheets of silkworm eggs that will be shipped within March. At that time, the company will coordinate with the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to统筹 and distribute them.</p>
<h3>Restaurants and Bars Can't Afford the Burden - Requesting a Reduction in Entertainment Tax - Otherwise, Demolish the Dance Floor - Band in Panic</h3>
<p>On the 19th of this month, restaurants and bars in this city received a notice from the Finance Bureau that from February onwards, the banquet tax for restaurants with music and dance floor facilities will be levied at 50% according to the entertainment tax, and the tax before the 19th must also be paid retroactively within only five days. The industry has submitted a request to the trade association for a reduction, otherwise it will have to dismantle the dance floor and cancel the music, which has caused panic among the bands, who have been gathering to discuss and submit a request to the authorities to consider the actual difficulties.</p>
<h3>Narcotics Found on a Puppet Official - Jumped from Building in Panic and Died</h3>
<p>The Body of Xu Shichang was Autopsied Yesterday</p>
<p>[This newspaper reports] Xu Shichang, a lawyer from Zhejiang, willingly betrayed the country during the War of Resistance and participated in the puppet organization, serving as the president of the Chongming District Court, the chief prosecutor of the Procuratorate of the Taicang District Court, and the chief prosecutor of the Procuratorate of the Wuxing District Court, among other puppet positions. After the victory, he fled to Shanghai and hid at 242 Avenue Emmet, because he was reported to the Wuxing judicial authorities. Therefore, Chen Wenxin, a prosecutor from the county's district court who also served as a prosecutor from the high court, sent Xu Chushu and Qian Jiang, two policemen from the police department, to Shanghai, requesting assistance from the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate. On the afternoon of the 26th, Xu was arrested at his residence on Avenue Emmet and imprisoned on the fourth floor of the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate Detention Center on Rue Massenet, listed as prisoner number 982. It is learned that the prisoner had an addiction. When the detention center sent personnel to inspect the prison cell as usual the other day, a package of opium dross was found in Xu's pocket. Xu was panicked and in a hurry, so he took the opportunity to jump from the fourth floor, causing his skull to rupture and blood to flow all over the ground. Although the detention center provided first aid, he died at 5 o'clock. Yesterday, the District Court Procuratorate sent a prosecutor to examine the body, and then his son took it away for burial.</p>
<h3>Narrowly Encountered - Traitor Arrested</h3>
<p>Gu Guoxiong Tried Again Yesterday</p>
<p>[This newspaper reports] Gu Guoxiong, a secret agent of the puppet Shanghai South Gendarmerie on Penglai Road, had previously worked with the enemy gendarmerie to arrest Yang Jiaji, the director of the Pudong Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League, without success, and then took his sister Yang Wan'er back to the enemy Gendarmerie on Rue Petain, where she was severely tortured and detained for seven days before being released. After the victory, Yang Wan'er suddenly ran into him while shopping at the Daxin Company and called the police to arrest him. The High Procuratorate concluded the investigation and filed a public prosecution. The case has been tried once, but the defendant firmly denies that he was a secret agent, only claiming that he was a miscellaneous worker. Yesterday morning, Judge Cao Jun opened the court to interrogate him again and summoned Yang Jiaji and Yang Wan'er to the court to falsely state the experience of being victimized. The defendant still tried to quibble and deny. The court ruled that the case would be investigated further and adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Four Japanese War Criminals Receive First Trial - Killed American Pilots</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] Another war criminal trial committee organized by Lieutenant Colonel MacLennan (presiding judge), Colonel Gabbart, and six others yesterday morning held the first trial of Japanese war criminals who killed three members of the Doolittle Raid at Tilanqiao Prison. They were Lieutenant General Sawada Shigeru, former commander of the 13th Division, Captain Takeda Sotojiro, former commander of the Jiangwan POW camp, Captain Wakou Yuuki, a member of the Japanese Military Tribunal, and Lieutenant Okada Ryuhei. The prosecutor, Lieutenant Colonel Handren, stood up and read seven counts of Sawada Shigeru's crimes, accusing him of establishing a military court from August to October 1942, violating the rules for prisoners of war, and sentencing Lieutenant Mark, Lieutenant Farrow, Sergeant Spots, and Lieutenant Mater (who did not die) to death in Shanghai, and sentencing Lieutenant Haet, Lieutenant Barr, Lieutenant Nelson, and Sergeant Tischer to life imprisonment, and adding abuse. He then accused Takeda of executing Mark, Farrow, and Spots on October 15, 1942, and abusing the other four American pilots. He also accused Wakou and Okada of the same crime, sentencing the three American pilots to death without formal trial procedures. Defendant's attorney, Lieutenant Colonel Bowden, raised objections to the number of jurors in the court, and then requested the cancellation of this court. The court ruled that the defendant's attorney's points should be strictly rejected. Defendant's attorney, Captain Fellows, also requested that the charges against the four defendants be dropped, which were also rejected one by one by the court. After both sides argued until half past twelve, the court summoned the criminals to stand before the court and asked if they had committed any crimes. All four criminals answered "not guilty." At this point, the court announced that the trial would begin at 9:00 am on March 11.</p>
<p>In addition, the case of the 18 Japanese war criminals killing three American pilots will be sentenced at 9:00 am this morning.</p>
<h3>The Problem of British Vessels Navigating Inland Waters Under the British Flag: Shipping Organizations Question the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shipping Guild, the Merchant Ship Captains Association, the Marine Engineers Union, the Navigation Officers Association, the Seamen's Union, the Pilots Association, and the Shipping Association, jointly sent a letter via express mail to the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration yesterday, raising six questions regarding the leasing of British merchant vessels and their navigation in Chinese territorial waters under the British flag, requesting a detailed reply. It is also reported that regarding the transportation of relief supplies, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Shipping Guild, and the Water Transport Command of the Logistics Department have already agreed to use various types of vessels, including military, public, and civilian, to transport relief supplies as much as possible, except for urgent military and public transportation. The supplies will be transported from Beijing and Shanghai to Hankou and other places. Over one hundred motorized junks and sailing junks have been gathered to assist in this transportation, ensuring that the delivery of relief supplies will not be delayed.</p>
<h3>The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Begins Selling American Wheat</h3>
<p>A Provisional Price of 8,000 National Currency Yuan Per Shih Tan</p>
<p>Following the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's unrestricted sale of flour at 6,000 yuan per bag starting on the 21st, black market prices for flour and rice have gradually declined. The Administration has also announced that it will begin selling American wheat on the 28th. Flour mills in this city and other areas with complete equipment that can begin milling flour after purchasing American wheat may formally apply to the Administration according to the following conditions, which will be reviewed and allocated: (1) Price: The Administration stipulates that the American wheat will be sold by the shih tan, with a provisional price of 8,000 yuan of national currency per shih tan; (2) Payment: After receiving notification from the Administration approving the quantity, the factory must pay the full amount of the purchase price before taking delivery of the goods, but those purchasing an entire ship of American wheat may apply for installment payments; (3) Delivery: After the ships carrying the American wheat arrive in Shanghai, the Administration will notify the factory to take delivery in the ship's hold. All expenses, such as weighing, lighterage, and overdue ship rent, shall be borne by the factory. (However, those purchasing small quantities of American wheat may apply to take delivery at the Administration's warehouse, and in addition to the wheat, they must pay the aforementioned expenses); (4) Gunny sacks: The factory must provide its own.</p>
<p>(Another News) It is reported that Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, has twice asked the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to further reduce the sale price of subsidized flour by 1,000 yuan to further lower market prices. He also suggested that the purchase limit per household should be reduced to two bags, and that companies and factories purchasing more than two bags should have a certificate from their respective organizations to indicate restrictions and prevent abuses.</p>
<h3>One Shipment of Relief Supplies Transported from Shanghai to Hunan Province</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has nearly 400 metric tons of relief supplies, including used clothing, food, and medical supplies, which were transported to Changsha and Yueyang on February 21st by one SLM landing craft and three LC-1 landing boats.</p>
<h3>Large Donation from the United Kingdom Supports UNRRA</h3>
<p>Ms. Heindell Held a Reception for the Press Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The British Information Office in this city held a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at the British Consulate on the Bund yesterday because Ms. Heindell, a British labor issue expert who had worked for the Shanghai Municipal Council for more than ten years, returned to Shanghai after traveling to Chongqing, Burma, Hong Kong, and other places to investigate labor and social welfare conditions. Mr. Luo, the director of the office, and Mr. Raja Suriya, the chief editor, hosted the event.</p>
<p>Insufficient Distribution and Supply of Materials</p>
<p>After Mr. Luo introduced Ms. Heindell to the reporters, she gave a speech, stating in brief: The United Kingdom wholeheartedly supports UNRRA, and of the US$675 million allocated by UNRRA to China, the United Kingdom has donated more than US$110 million, approximately one-sixth of the total amount. The predecessor of UNRRA was the "Committee on Allied Post-War Requirements," established in London in October 1941, and the chairman of that committee was Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, who is very familiar to the Chinese. However, the United Kingdom did not want to both donate to UNRRA and then request assistance from UNRRA to supply Malaya, Burma, and other places. Therefore, the United Kingdom had to seek other means of relief and bear the responsibility of double donations. Currently, the distribution of materials in these countries is strictly controlled. However, insufficient supply has become a major difficulty.</p>
<p>The Phenomenon of High Special Prices is Universal</p>
<p>Ms. Heindell then answered questions from reporters, stating in brief: (1) Wage standards cannot keep up with prices, which has become a common situation in various countries. Regarding labor disputes in this city, she is not yet very clear about the situation and needs further research. (2) Approximately 100 to 300 tons of relief goods are transported to Guangdong by rail every day, but 500 additional trucks have now been prepared to assist in transportation. (3) There have been strikes in Singapore, and there have been many labor disputes in Hong Kong, especially the dockworkers' strike, which lasted for two months, but there were no strikes. Ms. Heindell is very concerned about the situation of the Shanghai press and promised to pay attention to the shortage of paper. She said that even the largest British newspaper, The Times of London, is currently only publishing two large sheets.</p>
<h3>Hacking the Head Three Times: Little Niu Zi Dies: A Tragic Incident Occurs in the Competition for Dock Work</h3>
<p>At around 8:00 AM on the 27th, at the home of Zhu Hongwen at No. 12 Fukang Road, Yangjiadu, Pudong, a group of 30 to 40 thugs armed with axes, pistols, iron rods, etc., suddenly broke in. Unable to find Zhu Hongwen, they grabbed Pan Xiaoniuzi and Xiaoheizi (i.e., Zhang Gengchun) and hacked Pan's head three times with an ax behind the house, causing him to fall to the ground and die instantly. Xiaoheizi and Zhu Zhangshi were also injured in the head by the hacking. The thugs fired several shots into the air and dispersed. The Yangjiadu police station rushed to the scene and arrested more than ten suspects, including Chen Guisheng and Yang Jinlin, who were taken to the police station for interrogation. It was found that the main culprits in this case were Chen Xiaogou, Wu Changfa, and Liu Fugen. Officers were dispatched to continue the arrest. It is reported that this case arose from a dispute over the repatriation of dock luggage porters. There had already been two clashes on the 9th and 10th of this month, and mediation failed to reach an agreement, leading to another incident.</p>
<h3>Customs Prohibits the Import and Export of Foreign Currency</h3>
<p>Regarding the import and export of foreign currency, the Jianghai Customs issued a notice yesterday, stating in essence: The import and export of foreign currency banknotes is strictly prohibited without a permit. Foreign passengers entering the country are allowed to carry up to 200 US dollars or the equivalent value in goods. Amounts exceeding this limit are not allowed to be carried.</p>
<h3>Public Office Candidates Who Pass the Examination are Eligible to Run for Senator Elections: The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau Promotes the Examination Work</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government recently received orders from the Examination Yuan and the Executive Yuan to actively prepare for the examination of public office candidates. After Mayor Qian received the order, he immediately assigned the Civil Affairs Bureau to plan and implement the work. It is learned that this examination business has been launched on February 20. Since the city will soon be holding elections for representatives of various levels of public opinion organs, any citizen of the city who wishes to participate in the election must first apply for the examination of public office candidates. Only those who have passed the examination and obtained the qualifications of a candidate can be elected. Public office candidates are divided into two categories, A and B. Category A public office candidates can run for election as municipal senators, district heads, and deputy district heads. Category B public office candidates can run for election as district people's representatives, bao chiefs, and deputy bao chiefs. Anyone who wishes to apply for the examination can go to the Civil Affairs Bureau, the district office, or the office of the bao chief at any time to inquire, and they will be given a detailed answer.</p>
<h3>The Xumao Ship Runs Aground and is Damaged</h3>
<p>The Xumao motorized junk, leased by Ningding Shipping Company, sailed from Shanghai to Hankou with 87 tons of cargo on the 17th. The next day, when it sailed to Zhanghuanggang near Nantong, it ran aground on a sandbar due to the rapid rising tide and strong winds. The ship was small and unable to withstand the conditions, so it ran aground. After the tide receded, it could not be pulled out for a while, and the hull was damaged after being aground for a long time. It was towed to Shanghai the day before yesterday and is now berthed at No. 4 floating dock and needs to be repaired.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Inspectors While Carrying Weapons</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At around 11:00 PM the night before last, police officers Li Xianglin and others from the Penglai Sub-bureau were patrolling near the Liuyunhui Temple on Lujiabang Road when they discovered two pedestrians, Yao Kun and Zhang Jinhai. A box gun was found on Yao's person. According to their statements, they were members of the inspection team of the headquarters. After taking them to the police station and inquiring with the headquarters, it was found that there were no such people. They were actually impersonating. After interrogation, they were transferred to the Municipal Police Bureau for punishment.</p>

<h3>Coal Shortage in Shanghai Expected to Ease: Five Ships Arrive in Succession Carrying Tens of Thousands of Tons: The Fuel Management Committee Encourages Foreign Coal Imports</h3>
<p>The Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has continued to receive a large batch of bituminous coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai. The HILDA ship, with 6,600 tons, is currently berthed at the Dongjiadu Wharf and is being unloaded into the Mitsui Zhongzhan warehouse. There are four more ships that have arrived outside Wusongkou, including the Kerley ship with 9,300 tons, which is scheduled to supply the power company; the Manx ship with 9,300 tons, which is scheduled to be unloaded into the Yitai and Zhan warehouses; the Beihe ship with 2,264 tons, which is scheduled to be unloaded into the Mitsui Second Zhan warehouse; and the Shanmantley ship with 9,000 tons, which is scheduled to be unloaded into the Mitsui First Zhan warehouse. It is also reported that the committee will soon improve the fuel transportation issue.</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that the Fuel Management Committee is encouraging foreign coal imports. Several coal industry manufacturers have already ordered foreign coal, which will arrive in large quantities soon. At the same time, it is also supporting the mining and transportation of small local coal mines and white coal mines near Beijing and Hangzhou, which will also provide a small supplement in supply. As for the coal stored along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, it can only be used for the railway and the military and public along the line. It cannot temporarily supply Shanghai. The shortage will be supplemented by transportation from Shanghai. Next month, it is hoped that the Huainan Coal Mine Tongzhao Wharf Railway will be repaired and a large amount of coal will be transported to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Social Service: The Poor Children's Craft Institute Appeals to All Sectors to Donate Generously</h3>
<p>— Nian Zu</p>
<p>Welcoming Donations of Money, Goods, and Monthly Subscriptions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Poor Children's Craft Institute, located at Xiaonanmen, South City, was established eight years ago. At that time, it was right after the August 13th Incident, and the national army retreated westward, and refugees were everywhere. Therefore, gentlemen such as Qia Qing organized the Refugee Relief Association to shelter the victims of the Shanghai disaster. Because there were many orphans, it was necessary to provide them with education and upbringing, so the Poor Children's Craft Institute was established. For eight years, all the directors have been supporting it with great difficulty, and they have never solicited donations from outside. The newly appointed honorary chairman, Huang Jinrong, and chairman, Wang Xiaolai, believe that the equipment in the institute needs to be expanded, and the number of orphans being sheltered is increasing daily. The monthly expenses are also increasing, and in addition to the monthly donations from the directors, it is far from enough. They are appealing to enthusiastic people in society to donate money, monthly subscriptions, or in-kind donations, such as daily necessities, clothing, medical and health supplies, etc., which are all welcome. Please send them to the institute's office at No. 148 Longmen Road, Baxianqiao. An advertisement will be published to express gratitude. There are currently nearly 100 orphans, male and female, in the institute. They attend classes in the morning and work in the afternoon, divided into sewing, cardboard boxes, and net bags. There is also a well-trained military band. The institute's education and management are serious, and Chinese and foreign people who visit the institute praise it.</p>
<h3>Surplus Counterfeit Money Transferred to Education Loans</h3>
<p>Reader's Letter Suggestion</p>
<p>To the reporters of the Shen Bao and ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life: We have a small suggestion that we think you will definitely be happy to support. This issue is very simple and very important. I think you must have a lot of counterfeit money in your hands in denominations of ten, one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand, etc. No matter how much, there is only one month left until the exchange period. Instead of leaving it in the drawer, why not send it to the safe deposit box, collect it into a certain amount, and then send it to the Shen Bao to be used as education loans to help a few poor students. Why not do two things at once? This is just my humble opinion, which seems reasonable. If you adopt it, please publish it. As for the collection and safekeeping, I humbly request that your newspaper do its best to support it, which would be even more appropriate. Sincerely, Wu Xinming of the Daran Textile Company.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Wu's suggestion is excellent. Please implement it first. This column will be happy to collect it on your behalf. We hope that readers will actively contribute, and that poor students will benefit immensely. This is indeed the only contribution to national talent development.</p>

<h3>After the Opening of the Exchange Market, Gold, Banknotes, and Bonds All Fell: There are Still Various Speculations about Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Han Chi: Yesterday, with the opening of the foreign exchange market and with Bei's assumption of the post of president of the Central Bank, speculation gradually subsided. In Chongqing, there were various speculations, and the general psychology still regarded the US exchange rate as 2,000 to 1 and gold as 1.35 million, so the US banknotes in the market yesterday were inferior to gold. The morning opening was 1.43 million, and the lowest was 1.37 million. Taking advantage of the low price, the remaining funds were absorbed (real goods were received for real goods, regardless of interest, with no speculative effect at all). It once rebounded to 1.51 million (the buying and selling prices were far apart, making it extremely difficult to be sure), but the US banknotes failed to keep up and showed degeneration. At noon, it was still reduced to 1.4 million with some odd numbers, a decrease of 150,000 compared to the previous close. In the afternoon, US banknotes fell below 2,100 yuan, and asking prices fell below 1.4 million. Transactions were scarce and not widespread. The quotations of various firms varied, with the 1.4 million mark fluctuating. Ornamental gold was not listed, silver was 2,000 yuan, and silver dollars were around 850 yuan. Supply exceeded demand, and interest rates were still within 20%.</p>
<p>US banknotes: Yesterday, because most psychologists thought the rate would be 2,000 to 1, the market price was still 10% higher. Sellers still felt it was profitable. The morning opening was 2,270 yuan, and sellers continued to make persistent efforts, gradually dropping to around 2,100 yuan before slightly rebounding. However, it was still difficult to maintain above 2,150 yuan. At noon, it was still hovering around 2,100 yuan, a decrease of about 300 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong tickets should be an exception (calculated based on the US exchange rate of 2,000 to 1, the exchange rate between the United Kingdom and the United States should be 500 yuan, and calculated based on the black market US banknotes in Hong Kong, it should be around 330 yuan), but in any case, it was difficult for buyers to cheer up. New goods were even worse. As a result, old goods fell by 10 yuan, and new goods also fell by more than 10 yuan. Transactions were quiet.</p>
<p>Government bonds: Initially, the market was weak, and mobile funds rarely showed an urge to make a show. Some people absorbed them when the price was low. Grade C rebounded from 1,300 to 1,550 yuan, and finally around 1,500 yuan, which was slightly better by 50 yuan compared to the previous close. Other miscellaneous brands failed to keep up, and they were plain and unremarkable. Chinese stocks were still hovering around the previous day's price. There was demand for unpopular stocks, but the asking price was not high, and it was difficult to close a deal. Foreign stocks were also about 5% lower. All of these were supply and demand of real goods, purely for direct trading and lacking openness.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Fall: Both Yarn and Cloth Show Small Declines</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn: Yesterday, the yarn market was even more depressed. As gold prices continued to fall, people were tired of it. As a result of competition among peers, prices fell by more than 10% compared to the previous day. All 20-count yarns, except for Shuangma, have returned to the million mark. The 16-count Guangming initially sold for 910,000, and the closing price dropped to 860,000. Among the declining yarn lines, this brand's decline was relatively slow.</p>
<p>Cotton: Yesterday, the transaction of spot cotton was still smooth, and the market situation was not much improved. It was purely affected by the black market of gold and the decline of yarn and cloth. Generally, those holding goods devalued and sold them, resulting in a situation of brisk sales but tired prices. The Fangjian Company exclusively imported a large amount of 2,000 pieces of American cotton Midling. The Shenxin Yarn Factory imported 500 to 600 bales of Fiery Mistletoe Cotton, and the factory price was 3,000 to 4,000 yuan lower.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth: Transactions were quiet. It is observed that the opening of foreign exchange and the decline in gold prices made all gangs have a wait-and-see attitude. This street is also in a state of desolation due to the sale of subsidized cloth.</p>
<h3>American Cotton and Gasoline Arrive in Shanghai: A Large Batch of Bristles is Loaded</h3>
<p>A large batch of American cotton and gasoline arrived in Shanghai. The Eastern Prince ship of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., loaded with a large batch of more than 7,900 pieces of cotton, more than 19,000 barrels of gasoline, and 410 tons of diesel, entered the port at around 3:00 PM yesterday. It first berthed at the Asia Wharf to unload gasoline, and 48 passengers also took small boats to land at the New Customs Wharf. After the gasoline was unloaded, it moved to the China-America Company Wharf to unload cotton.</p>
<p>A large amount of Yangtze River bristles came to Shanghai. The Jiangyu ship of China Merchants Steam Navigation, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, transported 1,115 pieces of black bristles and 23 pieces of white bristles from Yichang, which is the first large number of bristles to arrive in Shanghai after the war.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices Fall Slightly: Fuel Also Turns Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, all grains went downstream in unison. The rice market had a surge of goods and could not digest them, and there was no buyer, so it fell by another 2,000 yuan. Flour also fell by a small 200 yuan. Soybeans were extremely sluggish and fell by more than 1,000 yuan sharply. Oil prices plummeted. There were still sources from Qingdao, and the price fell by 2,000 yuan gradually. Soybean cake fell by 100 to 200 yuan, and bran fell by nearly 100 yuan. Only raw peanuts were able to stand still.</p>
<p>The coal market transaction was still slack, and the market gradually stabilized. Yesterday, a batch of about 100 tons of Lizhang White Coal was transported to Shanghai. The coal is produced in Daye, Hubei, and its quality is slightly lower than Yangquan Coal. It is also a good raw material for manufacturing coal balls. This time, it was transferred from Wuhu to Shanghai, and the price was 220,000 yuan, which was still popular.</p>
<p>Education and Sports</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Convened a Meeting of School Principals: Soaring Rice Prices Severely Hit Teachers and Students: School Principals Bitterly Explained the Truth and Asked to Maintain Schools</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Hangzhou Correspondence] Recently, the price of rice in Hangzhou City has suddenly risen. On the 21st, medium white rice was still 18,500 yuan, but on the 24th, it rose to 26,000 or 7,000 yuan, and it still continues to rise. Public and private secondary schools in Hangzhou City opened at this time, and tens of millions of teachers and students in universities and primary and secondary schools were severely hit. There is a great situation where students cannot enter school and schools cannot open their doors. The education problem is extremely serious. The Education Department convened the principals of public schools in the provincial capital, as well as the heads of the competent departments, supervisors, and secretaries, to discuss together on the afternoon of the 23rd. The principals bitterly explained the truth, on the one hand, asking for life for teachers and students, and on the other hand, requesting to maintain the schools. The meeting lasted for three hours, and the situation was very tense. According to one principal, there are currently four difficulties: (1) The problem of rehabilitation expenses. When schools open and students attend classes, food, lodging, teaching utensils cannot be reduced. The rehabilitation fees received by the schools are very small, and it is really impossible to handle them. Today's meeting did not yield any results, and the schools can only do things simply, and teachers and students can only sleep on the floor and chant on the ground. Classrooms, dormitories, and dining halls are mixed together. Considering the current situation of the schools, it is possible to borrow money from the students. (2) The food problem for public-funded students, normal school students, and vocational school students. The central government stipulates a main food expense of 4,000 yuan per month, but this province has expanded the quota and temporarily allocates 3,000 yuan per month per person, which can only provide more than ten catties of rice. The difference is very large. In addition to alerting the central government and asking the food office to allocate subsidized rice, the shortage can only be collected from the students, which is a serious difficulty for some poor students. (3) The problem of students' excessive burden. This is a price problem that no one can solve. The only thing the provincial school collects from students is miscellaneous fees, 35 to 40 catties of rice, and a total of 1,000 to 1,300 yuan for physical education, medicine, derivative internships, etc. The collection of miscellaneous fees is because the provincial school's office expenses are only 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The Education Department has the hard work of maintaining education, and the collection of miscellaneous fees is to make up for its use, all of which must be reported to the department for review. The remaining food rice, non-staple food, books, school supplies, and lecture fees are all agency-handled, and the surplus is returned. The total cost of the full-term rice for boarding students is 200 catties, the non-staple food fee is only 2,400 yuan per month, and other expenses are 14,350 to 22,350 yuan. The most difficult of these is the rice problem. (4) The problem of teachers' lives. Teachers' salaries in this province are meager. With today's rice prices, their income is only enough to buy rice. The life of poverty and sorrow can be known. It is proposed to ask the Farmland and Food Department to issue subsidized rice to slightly alleviate it.</p>
<h3>Unregistered Specialized Schools Should Expedite Registration</h3>
<p>[This City News] Many private tutoring schools in this city brazenly use names like "English College" or "Technical College" in advertisements to attract students. However, in reality, they do not meet the standards of specialized education and have not been approved by the Ministry of Education before starting operations. The Municipal Education Bureau, aware of this, is actively investigating and prohibiting such practices. Regarding nine schools, including Cambridge English College, Zhijiang English Specialized School, Yin Yi English Specialized College, Meng Xian English College (day and night), China Commercial English College (day and night), Nanyang Wireless Engineering College, and China Journalism College, the Ministry has issued an order through the Education Bureau instructing these schools not to use the names "Specialized College" or "Certain College." They must promptly correct their school names. Schools that meet the standards of specialized education should immediately apply to the Municipal Education Bureau, which will forward the application to the Ministry of Education to undergo registration procedures. Enrollment is only permitted after approval to operate as a specialized college has been granted.</p>
<h3>Yanjing University Fee Reduction Movement: School Council Confirms Measures</h3>
<p>[This City News] All students of Yanjing University in this city previously expressed disagreement with the tuition fee of 75,000 yuan set by the school. They initiated a fee reduction movement, which has now been successfully resolved. The principles have been finalized through discussions between Hui Qing, Chairman of the School Council, Ni Baochun, President of the University, and representatives from the Alumni Association, as follows: (1) Tuition fee of 45,000 yuan. For the remaining 30,000 yuan, if students can pay, the Alumni Association will issue a receipt. (2) If the school's budget is insufficient, students will be responsible for fundraising, subject to school approval.</p>
<h3>National University Professors Request Salary Adjustments, to Telegraph the Second Plenary Session with Earnest Appeal</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Professors from various national universities in this city recently convened a press conference at the YMCA yesterday, lamenting their meager salaries amidst soaring prices. Their salaries are even lower than those of a clerk at the National Bank. Attendees included Li Ximou, Pan Chengliang, Chen Daxie, Zhu Baiying from Jiaotong University; Ying Chengyi, Chen Kemei from Fudan University; Pan [blank] from Shandong University; Mai Weiyu (teaching at both Jiaotong and Shandong Universities); and Zhong Zhaolin, among other professors. Zhu Baiying first reported on the current salary situation, which is still calculated based on civil servant standards: a base salary multiplied by 80, plus a living allowance of 28,000 yuan. As a result, the most senior professors, who originally earned 600 yuan per month, now only receive 76,000 yuan. The situation for associate professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants is even more unbearable. It is said that one professor cannot even step outside his door, as his monthly salary runs out by the 18th day. Therefore, if the government does not want to witness the complete bankruptcy of education, it should implement effective measures to increase professors' salaries, allowing them to teach and conduct research with peace of mind. They do not dare to expect full adjustments based on the cost of living index but hope for reasonable adjustments with reference to it, along with the provision of research funding and rice. If the nation continues to disregard or lacks the sincerity to resolve their livelihood issues, they will have no choice but to collectively resign and pursue other careers. The professors indicated that they would soon establish a National University Professors' Union and send telegrams to the Second Plenary Session, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education with earnest appeals.</p>
<p>Municipal Middle School Teachers Petitioned Yesterday</p>
<p>[This City News] Over two hundred teachers and staff members from ten municipal middle schools in this city, due to low salaries insufficient to cover expenses, held a general meeting at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road the day before yesterday. They unanimously decided to demand salaries adjusted according to the cost of living index based on the base salary of the end of 1937. They also sent letters to the school principals and petitioned the municipal government. Yesterday (the 27th) at 10:00 AM, they sent six representatives to the Municipal Government to petition Mayor Qian. Secretary-General Shen Shihua received them and promised that the teachers would receive the same treatment as municipal government employees, namely, a base salary multiplied by 100 plus a subsidy of 30,000 yuan and six dou of rice. However, the representatives were not satisfied. It is reported that the teachers and staff will convene another meeting to discuss further action.</p>
<h3>Treatment of Graduates from Enemy and Puppet Specialized Schools Without Qualification Review</h3>
<p>[This City News] According to the Shanghai Qualification Review Committee of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Education received a letter from the Ministry of Personnel stating that graduates from specialized schools or higher under the enemy and puppet regimes in the recovered areas may be provisionally registered for probationary employment in various agencies pending review of their academic qualifications by the Qualification Review Committee of the Ministry of Education. However, their salaries should be temporarily paid at the level of clerks, not exceeding 80 yuan. This is to avoid difficulties in recovering funds if their qualifications are later found to be insufficient. (It is reported that the registration deadline for the Qualification Review Committee is March 15th).</p>
<p>University Professors' Union to be Established Soon</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Professors' Union, initiated by professors such as Li Denghui, Jin Tongsheng, Lu [blank] Hui, Geng Danru, Zhang Yao [blank], Zhang [blank] Qing, Zuo Renxia, Sun Guiding, Chen Gaoyong, Fu Tongxian, Ye Bingfu, and Ye Qifa, has been actively preparing for over a month and has filed with the relevant authorities. It is now reported that the preparatory work is complete, and the union will be established soon.</p>
<h3>Brief Reports</h3>
<p>The Zhangshi Guoxue Lecture Hall founded by Mr. Zhang Taiyan was led by [blank] Lun. After Mr. Zhang's death, it was managed by Madam Zhang.

<h3>Female Talent is Virtue (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Under the so-called "wise saying" "Lack of Talent is a Virtue in Women," how many female talents have been buried, and how many women have been deprived of educational opportunities?</p>
<p>For thousands of years, Chinese women have been bound by the horrific shackles of old ethics, without any freedom. The rulers of society and the "learned scholars" in the scholar-official class, in order to oppress and enslave women, first prevented women from having access to education, creating inequality in knowledge between men and women. Because of this inequality in knowledge, all other things naturally became unequal as well. Since women's status could not be equal to that of men, they were forever subordinate to men, becoming "toys" in the hands of men. Men could use the term "chastity" to stifle the source of women's emotions, while men could openly take concubines without being subject to criticism, and irresponsible men who seduced and abandoned women could go unpunished. Therefore, in feudal society, women were like sheep for men to slaughter at will. The "Lack of Talent is a Virtue in Women," a "teaching" from ancient sages that has been revered as the unalterable truth for thousands of years, is a shackle used by those "learned scholars" to confine women, and too many have been sacrificed under it.</p>
<p>A Saying That Should Have Been Abandoned Long Ago</p>
<p>Times have changed, and this "teaching" seems to have been implicitly eliminated. In today's world, where gender equality is advocated and equal educational opportunities are promoted, we naturally cannot allow such thinking to exist any longer. However, Chinese society today still exhibits semi-feudal characteristics, and all incorrect traditional concepts have not been completely eradicated. Just like this "teaching" that has confined Chinese women for thousands of years, there are still people who believe it is the truth. Those who call themselves advocates of "virtuous wife and good mother education" still use this saying that should have been abandoned long ago as the basis for their thinking. We cannot deny the progress of women's education in the past fifty years, but women's status in knowledge is still not as high as men's. There are various reasons for this, but one thing we absolutely cannot deny is that the majority of society has many misconceptions about the purpose of education. They believe that women's education is just an embellishment, a decoration. How many people believe that women study for "applying what they have learned"? How many people believe that women can achieve the same status as men in knowledge through studying? The idea that "a diploma is just for show" seems to be shared by many people.</p>
<p>Not only in China, but even in countries like Germany and France, their women's education cannot be considered undeveloped, yet the cry to "go to the kitchen" is still heard everywhere. American "bride schools" specialize in providing future brides with knowledge about household management and childcare, as if a woman's "talent" can only develop to the kitchen and the bedroom at most. In fact, women's nature and functions are certainly suitable for handling household affairs, but on the other hand, we cannot but strive to expand the scope of women's education. Especially in today's China, after eight years of resistance against Japan, we have finally won victory, and we will embark on the path of national reconstruction, advancing toward the grand road of building a new China. We need countless knowledgeable women to work with men to serve the country and society and to seek benefits for the people. To achieve this goal, we must first correct the misconceptions that the general public has about women's education, and we must expand the goals of education as much as possible, allowing women to freely enrich their knowledge and skills and have the opportunity to satisfy their desire for knowledge.</p>
<p>The Ability to Adapt and Thrive</p>
<p>We must abolish the reactionary slogan "Lack of Talent is a Virtue in Women" and replace it with "Female Talent is Virtue." Here, "talent" refers to a person's ability to adapt to life, which is broadly defined and includes all the knowledge and skills of daily life. True knowledge and skills must be combined with practice to have meaning. When theory and practice are integrated, one can naturally adapt well to all situations and thereby improve one's life. In this way, from the individual to society, from the small self to the large self, we will surely be able to push the world of humanity toward a bright future. Even if we set aside the country and society (in fact, improving the individual also improves the country and society), a woman with ample knowledge and skills will undoubtedly be of greater help in managing the family and raising children. How to manage one's household affairs in an orderly and appropriate manner, and how to ensure that one's children receive good family education (men naturally also have a responsibility in managing the family and raising children) requires sufficient knowledge and ability, which is not something that anyone can easily obtain. Letting ignorant women handle family affairs and raise children will never lead to success. Moreover, the relationship between the country and society and the individual is profound and crucial. Women in the future will not be "toys" confined to high buildings and subordinate to men. They should be conscious "members of society," and they should recognize their position and responsibility in society and even for the people.</p>
<p>A Conscious Common Act of Deep Intentions</p>
<p>As for "virtue," it generally refers to the term "morality." This includes "moral conduct" and "character." According to the research of modern ethicists, the meaning of morality is extremely broad. What people in the past considered moral has now lost its significance in the times and no longer has moral value. Of course, there are also common and objective moral standards that can have relatively lasting value for humanity, but morality is always a product of society, and the changes of the times and the evolution of society can change people's concepts of morality at any time. Morality is a set of rules for behavior. The rules of a conscious common behavior that arise among the various members of society to meet common needs are morality. In primitive society, it was believed that morality came from divine commands, and the concept of morality came from divine bestowal. In this way, morality was cloaked in the garb of religion. As people's intelligence grew, this was recognized as an instruction of "reason." People have a "rational self" in addition to their physical self. Although this statement gets rid of the religious color of "God," it is still not in line with modern ethical concepts.</p>
<p>American psychologist S. Fischir said that the development of individual morality often develops with the development of individual self-awareness, expanding from the self, the scope of moral concepts. Individual growth and environmental influences are conditions for the formation of moral behavior. According to the analysis of general scholars, to create a moral behavior, one must first have profound knowledge as the basis for reasoning and judgment. Socrates said: "Knowledge is morality." A Western proverb says: "Most sufferings come from the ignorant rather than from the malicious." Kant also said: "Knowledge is a mirror that reflects our actions." Indeed, knowledge is very important, although we cannot deny the importance of good habits and strong willpower in forming moral behavior.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<h3>How to Deal with Children</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>Children are innocent, have a natural inclination to obey, and generally harbor a subconscious belief in their little minds that "adults always know more than I do." Therefore, when instructing or encouraging them, you can always use a gentle tone, guiding them patiently. There is no need to shout or scold them excessively, as too much reprimand can make them "naughty" or even stubborn!</p>
<p>Children are naturally fond of playing, and sometimes they get their hands and faces dirty, but this is not their fault. You should clean them up afterward and tell them that dirty things should not be put in their mouths and that they should wash their hands before eating. Next time, they will wash their hands themselves!</p>
<p>Do not criticize their shortcomings in front of others, as this will diminish their self-esteem.</p>
<p>When children encounter things they do not understand and ask questions, you should answer and explain them in detail. However, do not do the homework or exercises they bring back from school for them, so as not to foster dependence.</p>
<p>When children take medicine, do not deceive them by telling them it is sweet, as this will teach them to deceive, and it will not work next time. It is better to persuade them nicely, saying that taking this medicine will make them feel better and their body will not be uncomfortable. This will have a better effect.</p>
<p>Do not easily grant children's requests. Once you grant them, do not forget to fulfill them, so as to cultivate their habit of keeping promises.</p>
<p>Love is good, but too much of it turns into spoiling.</p>
<p>Do not dress children in overly luxurious and elaborate clothes, as this will cultivate extravagance.</p>
<h3>Priority for Pregnant Women in Queues</h3>
<p>— Ouli</p>
<p>British Food Minister Sir Ben Smith has stipulated that pregnant women's ration books should be printed with the words "Queue Priority Please" in order to give pregnant women priority in collecting their allocated food. Pregnant women with this ration book have the right to move to the front of the queue when queuing in front of shops in London.</p>
<p>This kind of preferential treatment for pregnant women could also be practiced in our country.</p>
<p>Common Sense</p>
<h3>Waste Utilization</h3>
<p>— Jianru</p>
<p>In this society where all prices are rising endlessly, every family is always worried about the difficulty of life, constantly thinking about how to "increase income" and how to "reduce expenditure." One of the slogans of the New Life Movement is: "Be diligent in increasing income and thrifty in reducing expenditure." Naturally, being able to utilize waste, calculated over the years, the amount can be quite significant! Now I will write a few items that can be utilized:</p>
<p>(1) Soap Scraps Collect leftover soap scraps. When you have accumulated enough, dissolve the soap in lard, add some salt, simmer it into a paste, pour it into a mold, and after it solidifies, take it out and cut it into soap.</p>
<p>(2) Rags Accumulate old clothes or scraps of cloth. You can sort them out and weave them into mops. The ones sold on the market are also made of rags.</p>
<p>(3) [Missing character] Shell [Missing character] shells can be used as dye. Just put the eaten [missing character] [missing character]shells in a pot, add some green [missing character], add water and boil it, and you can dye primary color fabrics.</p>
<p>(4) Old Leather Soles Old leather shoe soles are very useful. You can rework them into women's or children's shoe soles.</p>
<p>(5) Rice Straw Ash The ashes from daily burning seem useless, but you can use them to polish copper pots and utensils, making old ones look new. Or, you can soak them in water and use the liquid to wash clothes. It functions like soap and can remove dirt. It can also be used as fertilizer.</p>

<h3>Homemade Little Cape</h3>
<p>— Cangmei</p>
<p>Children's clothes are very wasteful. We can find an old coat, put in some effort, and turn it into a useful and economical fashionable garment. Capes are very popular now, and I think they are very convenient for little girls to wear. Because in winter, if you wear a padded robe and then add a coat, you will definitely look bulky. A cape is simple and elegant.</p>
<p>The dimensions of the cape in the diagram (in feet) are suitable for a five- or six-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Material: Preferably woolen fabric. If you use old clothes, just iron the reverse side flat, and it will look like new. The material for trimming the neckline and cuffs all around should preferably be diagonal checks or bright and vibrant colors. It can brighten up a plain, dark-colored fabric. As for the lining, you can use old materials.</p>
<p>Instructions: Cut according to the dimensions in the diagram. First sew the pleats and seams together with needle and thread, and then machine-stitch along the dotted lines. Join the two pieces in the front, left and right, and then sew them into a cape shape. Attach the hood and make two shoulder pads (sew them into dumpling shapes, pad them with cotton wool, and place them on the shoulders), and then attach the lining. (The lining can be cut more simply. The back can be cut as a flat piece, without pleats; the front can be cut by joining the two pieces into one). After completing the entire garment, finally trim the edges. The total length of the trimmed edge is about eighty-two inches, the length of the trimmed edge of the sleeve opening is five inches, and the neckline should be secured with a hook and eye and two round buttons and a button loop. This completes a simple and useful cape. You may wish to first try making one from an old adult garment, adjusting the dimensions accordingly to enlarge or reduce the size for the child.</p>
<p>Hobbies</p>
<h3>The "Mahjong" That Consumes Life</h3>
<p>— Tracing the Cause</p>
<p>"Mahjong" is a game that consumes life! Because "time is what life is made of" (as Franklin said), consuming time is consuming life. And playing mahjong consumes the most time, therefore it consumes life the most.</p>
<p>There has always been a contradictory phenomenon in our society, which is "people have nothing to do, but there is no one to do things." Playing mahjong is the most common manifestation of people having nothing to do. Of course, this phenomenon occurs not because there is really nothing to do, but because people don't know what to do or are unwilling to do it. This is a very terrible phenomenon. The fall of the Ming Dynasty was due to Ma Diao, the predecessor of mahjong. This time, China has suffered an unprecedented disaster, and mahjong is not without its contribution. Because the trend of playing mahjong has been extremely rampant in the past few decades. Mr. Hu Shi once calculated that the total time spent on playing mahjong across the country every day is at least 167,000 days! Just imagine, if this amount of time were used to do other things that are beneficial to society, the family, or the individual, wouldn't its achievements be quite considerable? If accumulated over a year, or decades, wouldn't its achievements be even more astonishing? Naturally, the cumulative result of these achievements would be social progress and national strength. Now, spending such precious time on playing mahjong, the result is naturally the opposite, and the occurrence of national disasters is not accidental.</p>
<p>However, what is even more heartbreaking is that today, when we have won the victory of the Anti-Japanese War thanks to the cooperation of our allies, when every citizen should shoulder a share of the nation-building work, the evil trend of playing mahjong is still prevalent in the upper, middle, and lower social strata!</p>
<p>Moreover, playing mahjong is not only a waste of time, but also cultivates a person's speculative mentality and selfishness, and affects the feelings between relatives and friends. What's worse, it can cause psychological disorders due to worrying about gains and losses. When you win, you become elated and want to enjoy the windfall, so various bad habits such as eating, drinking, and having fun begin to take shape. If you lose, you become dejected, use it as an excuse to throw tantrums, and sleeplessly want to "win back the loss." Fortunately, if you win back the loss and quit from then on, that would be good, but because of the effect of compensatory psychology (compensating for some spiritual loss), you are unwilling to stop there and want to win a little more. But if you lose a little more, will you quit then? No, because you then develop a desire to get more after having achieved something. In this way, wanting to win back the loss when you lose, and wanting to win again when you win, it continues endlessly, and you can never extricate yourself. This is the common psychology of engaging in any kind of gambling, not just playing mahjong.</p>
<p>However, this energy-consuming and time-wasting game is not only loved by men, but women play it even more enthusiastically. Because men always have to go out to work, but women, the housewives, grandmothers, and young ladies of the leisure class, can of course entrust all the housework to servants and devote all their energy and time to playing mahjong without any problem. Even housewives in middle and lower-class families, who have no servants to entrust their housework to, will deal with their housework and children in an extremely "economical" way: they will buy some snacks to save themselves the trouble of cooking; they will pile up dirty clothes and bedding without washing them; they will let the dust accumulate thickly in the room without cleaning it; they will leave things in a mess without organizing them; they will let their children wander in the streets, fight in the alleys, and play pranks without controlling or educating them, and free up time to play mahjong. I really don't understand how the "mahjong" thing can be so mesmerizing!</p>
<p>But I believe that most gamblers understand that they are knowingly committing a crime, so this is not something that can be achieved through verbal persuasion. We must find constructive pastimes and entertainment to replace it. Because Chinese people, due to the lack of progress in their thinking and the low level of education, have always lacked good hobbies, such as the various ball games, swimming, hiking, reading, stamp collecting, and musical instruments that Europeans and Americans love. At the same time, due to environmental factors, legitimate pastimes and entertainment are restricted, such as the lack of parks, sports fields, libraries, and various amateur groups. Therefore, mahjong has become a popular pastime at the right time and place.</p>
<p>The author has long believed that to eradicate the evil habit of housewives playing mahjong, we must rely on the power of groups. It is best for knowledgeable women in each neighborhood to lead and organize a kind of national body, such as a social club, with women from one neighborhood or one alley as the organization's target—the scope of the organization should be small, as it is easier to manage when it is small. The clubhouse should be equipped with books, newspapers, magazines, entertainment equipment, etc., and readings or seminars and family visits should be held frequently to instill women with various necessary knowledge, such as household affairs, hygiene, child psychology and upbringing, and women's own self-cultivation. Sometimes, collective trips or visits are arranged, and sometimes educational exhibitions are held. On festivals, it is also possible to hold a carnival or concert. In short, anything that can increase women's knowledge and increase their legitimate interests can be innovated to improve their intellectual level, cultivate their noble hobbies, correct their bad lifestyles, and achieve the goal of eradicating the evil habit of playing mahjong.</p>

<h3>The Diaper Problem in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xiao Shuzhuang</p>
<p>I am overjoyed that my wife has given birth to a son.</p>
<p>What does this little rascal, born in the maternity hospital, need most when he can go home? Obviously, it's diapers.</p>
<p>First, the maternity hospital issued a certificate proving that the child was born alive.</p>
<p>"Go to the Women's Examination Office to get his diapers," they told me. When I arrived at the Examination Office, they said:</p>
<p>"You need to have a certificate of residence written by the landlord of your current residence; you also need a letter of guarantee when you pick up the diapers."</p>
<p>"Who will guarantee me?" I asked in surprise, "This baby?"</p>
<p>"The mother can issue a letter of guarantee," they replied.</p>
<p>So I ran to find the landlord and ran back to the maternity hospital to collect these certificates.</p>
<p>I returned to the Examination Office, and this time three certificates were exchanged for a new certificate. They told me mercifully:</p>
<p>"Send it to your wife's workplace."</p>
<p>When I arrived at my wife's workplace, my son was registered. Now, with documentaries and certificates, I went to the distribution office in the district. There, I received a diaper card.</p>
<p>Holding up this small green card in my hand, I couldn't help but think: if someone came up with a good idea to supply diapers—or at least diaper ration cards—directly from the maternity hospital, what would these kind gentlemen have to do?</p>
<p>On the seventh day after my son was born, he was put on a new shroud and was allowed to be discharged from the hospital. When he was discharged, they handed me a small piece of paper, saying:</p>
<p>"Here is your certificate for getting soap."</p>
<p>The little guy is over two months old, and that soap certificate has just turned into a bar of soap. It was not abandoned. This certificate first ran to the landlord, from there it was directed to the Women's Examination Office, then back to the landlord. Then it ran to the mother's workplace, from there to the distribution office in the district, from there to the father's workplace, then back to the distribution office in the district, and finally back to the maternity hospital.</p>
<p>It was not this piece of certificate that ran back and forth to these places, it was the father who accompanied it. That's what fathers are for.</p>
<p>On the back of the certificate, there is the following statement: "Soap ration cards should be collected directly from the maternity hospital. Signed, Head of the Ration Card Distribution Office, Kuzine Zoff." Just below this, we see again, "Submit this certificate to the department in charge of collecting other ration cards, and you can immediately obtain a soap ration card. (Signature, unclear)."</p>
<p>However, we finally got the bar of soap, but I kept this certificate. When my son grows up and can do things, I will show him this small piece of paper and say to him, "Child, tear it up! Remember, in your life, never issue such certificates or write such statements. Treat your fellow citizens like human beings!"</p>
<p>The above article is translated from the January 1946 issue of Reader's Digest, originally written by Yefirn Urhunsky. During the Anti-Japanese War, compatriots in the occupied areas tasted the bitterness of the rationing system under the enemy puppet government. Due to the pressure of life and the soaring prices, they had to swallow their anger and be driven around to fill out forms here and get ration tickets there. The procedures were really complicated. Housewives were even more vexed. Rice tickets, flour tickets, sugar tickets, oil tickets, coal briquette tickets, cloth tickets, etc. had to be remembered at all times, when and where to collect them, and they had to squeeze and be crushed. They either ran for nothing or spent money to get things that they couldn't eat or use, and that weren't enough to share. Reading this article made me very sympathetic to the experience of this Soviet author.</p>

<h3>Fond Memories</h3>
<p>— Shuyi</p>
<p>Living with children is truly a joy in life. Looking at their innocent and lively behavior and their carefree faces, it seems to make me younger. Sometimes, even when my heart is clearly disturbed by the hustle and bustle of the world, and I am sinking into the depths of depression, seeing Yemen's kindness and loveliness will make it all disappear. Learning together with them every day seems to return me to the golden age of the past.</p>
<p>In the minds of the children, I am like an emperor in dignity. My words are the children's laws. Their lives and emotions change with my will, and I live as if I were in my own world. Although living with stubborn children often requires thinking hard and being uneasy, afterwards, nothing is on my mind, just like reconciling with my brothers after getting angry at home. If the result can be to see their behavior or academic performance gradually improve, then the joy in my heart is truly indescribable, and I will cherish this child especially.</p>
<p>Now, illness has kept me away from them for almost two years; two years of separation have increased my longing, and I miss each and every one of them, and they must not have forgotten me either. If my health and circumstances permit in the future, I am still willing to return to this old profession, to be with innocent children, and to live a hard but warm school life.</p>
