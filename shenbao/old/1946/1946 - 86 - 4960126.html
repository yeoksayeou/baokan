<h3>吉倫與張周在渝會談　東北衝突決予制止　執行部將派小組前往</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿六日電〕暫行代理馬歇爾將軍之吉倫中將，昨與周恩來及張治中會談至深夜，今日復與周氏及蔣主席會商，關於派遣執行小組至東北，以阻止大規模內戰爆發之急切需要，預料官方公吿須延至明日始行公布。據悉，吉倫將軍及張周二人，或能於本週內親自飛往東北，監督執行停止衝突協定。若干方面預測，東北戰事荀不能加以制止，則中國其他部分或將引起更大之衝突，致使馬歇爾將軍之努力全功盡棄。倘張治中果飛往東北，則新疆之行勢將延期。據悉，吉倫中將力稱東北問題在目前較爲緊張。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿六日電〕周恩來昨從延安返渝，即與政府繼續討論，陪都盛傳，馬歇爾元帥將於四月十五日左右由美返中國。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕消息靈通人士稱：執行部確將派遣執行小組前往東北，調處軍事衝突，小組之數目可能爲五個至七個，具體地點尙未規定，詳細辦法亦尙在執行部擬定中，此訊執行部負責方面尙未予以證實。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿六日電〕軍委會發言人稱：共黨最近所提之停止衝突命令延展至東北及派執行小組一事，政府爲體念東北同胞，早日恢復地方秩序，在原則上雖已同意，但此自不能與一月十日共同頒布停止衝突命令內國軍開往東北不受任何限制之規定有所牴觸，且共黨軍隊更不能以此爲藉口，而阻撓國軍接收蘇軍已撤退之地區，或竟攻據國軍業已收復之地區。凡屬中國人民，莫不企求國家統一，主權完整。共產軍在東北各地之擾亂行爲，實違反人民之願望，而共黨新華日報本月十九，廿六兩日竟妄稱「瀋陽國軍擴大內戰進攻民主聯軍」，實屬歪曲事實，淆亂聽聞。</p>
<h3>蘇軍陸續撤退中　遼北省府人員昨晚抵長春</h3>
<p>〔本報長春廿五日電〕盛傳蘇軍將於二十六日遽然撤離長春之說，迄今日爲止，事實已使此謠言歸於幻滅。連日市上出現之蘇軍約較以往所見者爲文秀，且不時有豐姿綽的碧眼金髮之女兵，紅唇粉臉漫步街頭，商塲中可以遇見，娛樂塲所可遇見。就種種跡象觀之，三兩日內並無全撇之模樣。日來撤兵仍在繼續中，離長眷時，多改在寬城子車站（長春車站北），已不在以往經常出沒之長春車站。據稱；渠等登車離長春後多東行，經吉林，延吉而至海參威。此間人士咸盼蘇軍能早撤退，若干人士爲國軍能否於最近開抵長春顯示焦急，但以此詢諸我官方，均無確切答覆。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿六日電〕長春局勢在微妙發展中，蘇軍續有退走者，但爲量無多。昨午二道河子某印刷廠內之蘇軍，於最後退出該廠時，有人目擊共開走十一卡車着雜色軍服之中國勞工，每車有武裝蘇軍二人，沿吉長公路開去。該項勞工若稱之爲「部隊」或較妥貼。同時，有不少來歷不明之武裝，以各種不同之方法運進市區。保安第二總隊之步哨兵昨曾仕一載草之雙輪馬車中，搜出重機槍三挺，此外，尙有一棺木，向市內運送武器彈藥者。據交通界息，昨晚山寬城子車站北開軍車三列，載走蘇軍坦克車廿餘輛。</p>
<p>〔又電〕遼北省府人員，昨晚專車離開四平，惟行至公主嶺車站時被阻，鐵路當局廿六日另派專車往接，當晚抵長春。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿六日電〕此間官方今日宣布：蘇軍現正開始自東北大規模撤退。此項消息係外次劉鍇答覆詢問時所透露。蘇軍一大隊，隨帶坦克車及大砲，沿吉長公路自瀋陽開往長確是，向海參崴推進，但詳細情形無從探悉。王世杰外長宣布蘇軍將於四月前撤竣，以及大規模軍隊業已開始之說，使國際上因東北而造成之緊張局勢大見緩和，但如許多礦區及工業之機械配備，已爲蘇方拆卸等問題，則尙待解決。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿六日電〕我軍事代表團幽長董彥平，廿六日下午三時與蘇軍參謀長特浴曾科舉行第十七次會談，歷一小時，爲歷次會談之最短暫者，會後董氏拒絕發表意見。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿六日電〕報載，新一軍已抵四平街，惟平市人士認爲未免言之過早，因國軍大半從瀋陽徒步出發，兩地距離，足有一百零五哩，急行軍亦需五日方能到達。</p>
<h3>中美新商約已開始談判</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿六日電〕據悉，我根據中美新約規定，對共同敵人戰時結束後六個月內，中美兩國應商討通商條約，美政府於去年春即將中美友好通商航海條約約稿送達我國，經濟部就主管範圍將草約內關於外產權主取得經營事業之組織管理權之限制，自由貿易享受權利等，均經詳密硏議，並擬具對策方案，與美方開始談判，妥爲折商。</p>
<h3>西北行營人員陸續前往蘭州</h3>
<p>主任張治中將先赴新</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿六日電〕西北行營將於短期內在蘭州成立，內部重要工作人員已陸續前往籌備。行營主任張治中，俟軍事三人小組商談獲得最後協議，即將飛赴新疆，繼續與伊寗人民代表商談未決事項，然後再返蘭州。</p>
<p>〔中央社迪化廿五日電〕伊寗代表三人，廿五日晨飛抵迪化，此來係繼續商談解決新疆局部事變之問題。又新任新疆監察使麥斯武德，今晨飛抵迪化。</p>
<h3>政協綜合小組定明日財開會</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿六日電〕政協綜合小組開會三小時後，對於所討論之各項問題之措詞，僅有一項一致通過，即國民黨祇能選舉國府委員會中之國民黨委員，不能選舉其他各黨之委員。該會定廿八日再行開會，俾對於國民大會之組織成立最後協定，並使各黨派擁護政治協商會議之組織，該會更將設法調和政治協商會議及二中全會關於軍事問題意見之參商。</p>
<h3>調整公敎人員生活費用標準</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿六日電〕行政院今上午例會，通過調整中央文職公敎人員生活補助費支給標準，該辦法自本年三月份起施行，計一級基本給七萬元，薪俸加倍數一百六十倍（迪化·歸綏·包頭·康定），二級五萬元，一百六十倍（上海·南京·北平·天津·衡陽·長沙·昆明·廣州·新疆），三級四萬五千元，一百五十倍（重慶·武漢·杭州·桂林·靑島·開封·蘭州〕，四級四萬五千元，一百上十倍（江蘇·湖北·廣東·廣西·陜西·山西·河北·山東·甘肅·西康·浙江·福建·綏遠·雲南·河南·湖南），五級三萬五千元，一百三十倍，（四川·貴州·江西·安徽·寗夏·靑海，察哈爾）。又（一）警長照基本數七成支給，警士仍照膳食六成，工友支五成。（二）上海警長照基本數支九成，警士及工友均支八成。（三）文職官員已有改進待遇原則，數字另行擬定。（四）省級學校及各級軍校官員生膳食副食費，並另案調兵整。（五）重慶比一月份的增百分之五十八餘，各地區均增一倍以上。</p>
<h3>楊杰論國際局勢　十年內不致再發生戰爭</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明廿五日電〕軍事理論家楊杰將軍，今在昆市北平硏究院等八團體歡迎李石曾茶會中，討論目前國際局勢及未來之世界戰爭，批評第三次大戰，就要爆發的論調，略謂：列强間有三個問題：（一）是「得」，（二）是「安」，（三）是「能」，先想得人家的東西，得了之後，即想安全的保障，要想安全必須有能，而原子彈即係英·美保障安全之能，由於能的競爭，致使國際戰爭，似乎不可避免，但以目前各國情况而論，第三次世界大戰，在十年內不會爆發。我國在今後十年內，應努力和平建國，迎頭趕上，才能應付十年後的新局面。</p>
<h3>政府高級官員還都　四月中開始空運　蔣主席國大開幕前返京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕政府爲减輕施政困難，解除收復區人民之痛苦，實不能再在重慶過端陽，還都運輸辦法，已決定至四月中旬起，以廿架飛機，更番將政府各部高級官員運京，四月廿日以後，可能增加至五十架。政府已擬定計劃，使高級官員到京後，即開始工作，科員以下之工作人員，可從容飽覽三峽風景，慢慢乘空來京。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿六日電〕陪都華方人士稱：蔣主席將於四月廿日赴首都，大約勾留至國大閉幕，其後將否往遊美國或更去英國，法國，蘇聯一行，則尙未定。據現象觀之，蔣主席已預定出國一遊，並將偕夫人同行。</p>
<h3>華北今日開始大量遣送日俘</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕十一戰區吳副參謀長稱：遣送日俘事，前因船隻缺乏，輸送不暢，最近已商妥解決辦法，自廿七日起，塘沽港口可有四千五百俘僑登船回國。目前十一戰區待遣送之日俘有九萬餘，日僑十萬餘人，連同山西俘僑，共計十八萬餘人。</p>
<h3>渝郵局醖釀罷工</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿六日電〕關於郵局罷工風潮，雖未成事實，近日又漸成表面化，如當局仍不將本月份待遇調整，聞渠等將於廿八日全部總罷工，並向當局請願。</p>
<h3>貪汚總監班淦昨在蘭州槍次</h3>
<p>〔中央社蘭州廿六日電〕第八戰區兵站總監班淦貪汚案，經軍法會審有據，判處死刑，廿六日晨槍決。</p>
<h3>七組人員監督修路　恢復交通可樂觀　四十五日內鐵路將暢通</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕執行部對恢復交通一事，日內即將發表充滿樂觀之公報，據鐵路管理科稱：華北可優先進行修復鐵路，業已完成其工作百分之廿，如情形良好，則四十五日後，華北·華中全區內各鐵路綫將暢通無阻。據悉，目前已有七組人員工作于泊頭·安陽·南口·高密·棗莊·徐州·晏城·負責監督優先修理之各綫。各路修復情形，頗堪樂觀，以徐州爲例，隴海路已可行車至海州終點，徐州以北津浦綫數日後亦可通至臨城，自天津南行之列車，亦可到達泊頭，近數週來，各綫鐵路皆能構通至新地區，除上述優先修理各綫外，其他遭遇輕微破壞之各段，亦將加以連接，而使之恢復交通。此外，公路之恢復，亦在進行中，交部已派公路視察小組至承德·山海關·開封·石家莊·濟南·靑島等地察勘。執行部曾發給彼等通行證。軍調部中人宣稱：恢復交通工作之人力物力問題，決不能使彼等負責。又關於中共區鐵路之人事問題，交部可能用甄別加委等方式予以解決。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕隴海路東段徐海段復路工程，已完成一半，如無意外阻礙，下月初即可通車。津浦綫徐濟段，短期內尙難修復，現難民以牛車代步，由濟至徐需時十日。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿六日電〕據路局方面消息，濟南·徐州間之公路，路面尙可行駛，刻正計劃於最近期派車試行。</p>
<h3>魯省政令推行困難　共軍破壞郵政</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿六日電〕魯省民政廳長劉道元宣稱：勝利前，魯省政令推行所及地區，凡八十餘縣及十四個專員區。勝利後，共軍擴張地盤，逐漸侵佔，現由政府控制者，僅有七城·六地·一市。幹部麕集於未陷之城市中，約五千餘人，失業難民達一千四百餘萬，刻仍有繼續增加之趨勢。又據記者探悉：濟南現有五十個以上流亡縣府，彷彿戰時之英倫各國流亡政府，然彼等現時工作，係保存檔案，準備局勢安定，再行返任，執行任務。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿六日電〕據此間郵界負責人談稱：魯省郵政業務，因受共軍侵擾，倍極艱苦。戰前魯省凡一百四十餘所，而今能與郵政管理局保持聯絡者，僅三十餘所。勝利以後，全省郵局每月平均總收入僅幾百萬元，收支相抵，月虧七千萬元。共軍控制地區，强迫使用共軍發行之郵票，驅逐優秀員工，並任用以前凟職舞弊已被革職之員工，諸此破壞郵政，甚於敵偽。最近各地郵政員工，因不堪共軍壓迫，逃亡靑島濟南者日衆，彼等認爲共軍不擇　段，用以爭取政權之行爲，殊屬不智。</p>
<h3>參政會報吿程序結束　今起舉行審查會　昨大會為內政善救報吿</h3>

<p>〔又電〕參政會對糧政報吿之書面質詢案，計四十二件。</p>
<h3>利用難民囚犯開墾昆明荒地</h3>
<p>滇農改所建議省府</p>
<p>〔本報昆明廿五日電〕滇省農林改進所，近呈請省府利用無家可歸之難民流民及囚犯軍隊，開墾昆明至嵩明間之荒地，此項計劃，俟省府核准後，即可實施。</p>

<h3>整軍工作進行順利　「難兵」歸田則為當前困難</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕軍息：黄河以南之整軍工作，已大致就緒，黃河以北之河北·察哈爾·綏遠各省及西北陜·甘·寗·靑·新各省駐軍，從本月上旬起，即開始分別調整，因各部隊官兵均能明大義，識大體，進行極爲順利。各地編餘軍官，業照預定計劃，予以誚學或轉業之便利，惟當前最感困能者，聞各部隊中之湘籍子弟以及來自田間籍隸冀·魯·豫·鄂·贛·蘇·皖等省之編餘士兵，今日彼等之家郷大都因遭受兵災匪禍，發生嚴重之糧荒，據可信估計，若干部隊中之農家子弟，爲數至少在百分之五十以上，已成「有甲可解無田可歸」之「難兵」，目前中國農村雖需要人力，但現時各地之糧食情况及農村秩序，則至堪殷憂。安插上述「難兵」之最善辦法，乃不外「務農」與「做工」，然須求諸交通能早日恢復。在最近一月內，軍委會督促各綫復路通車之明令底稿，業盈箱滿　矣。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕全國整軍工作，華北列入第九期，即七月至九月間進行華北整軍。十一戰區吳副參謀長稱：整軍即係復員工作，在此工作未完成前，戰區暫不取銷。目前十一戰區轄區爲冀，察，熟至山東則已劃歸徐州綏署。</p>
<h3>陳逆璧君起訴書</h3>
<p>— 本報蘇州通訊員　青萍</p>
<p>江蘇高等法院檢察官起訴書起字第三九六號</p>
<p>被吿陳璧君，女，年五六歲，廣東新會縣人，住廣州法政路三十號，偽中央宮部執行委員。</p>
<p>右列被吿，民國三十五年度偵字第五三二號爲漢奸一案，業經偵査終結，認爲應行提起公訴，茲將該被吿犯罪事實及證　據　所犯法條，開列於後：</p>
<p>被吿陳璧君，係已故汪逆兆銘之妻，曾任中國國民黨中央監察委員會委員，中日戰事發生後，隨同汪逆前往重慶，民國廿七年秋間，汪逆勾結日酋供衛文　，秘密言和，被吿參與謀議。是年十二月，被吿與汪逆潛離重慶，先至河內，派陳逆公博至香港，發表艷電，響應近衛主張之和平三原則，旋與汪逆由河內至香港轉往上海。至廿九年三月間，在南京組織僞政府，公然反抗中央，其時汪逆任爲主席，被吿任僞中央黨部執行委員會委員及僞中央政治委員會委員，終汪逆之身，凡僞政府所有背叛中央，獻媚敵寇之詭計，被吿無不從旁贊助，觀於其組用「明」（指汪逆兆銘）「崖」指被吿密電字樣），爲與各方面通信暗號，是其與汪逆駢肩主政，把握實權，聲勢烜赫，至爲明顯。即至在逆已死，陳逆公博繼任僞主席時，被吿以一未亡人之身，尤復往來京滬粤漢等地，謬倡全面和平之說，以欺騙民衆，獻媚敵人，更密佈特工機構，慘害地下工作同志，使我數千年文化之古國淪於倭夷，而不知恥，賣國求榮，至死不悟，其通謀敵國，反抗本國之罪行，實屬無可容恕，茲考其在僞職期內禍國事蹟之最顯著者，分述於後：</p>
<p>（甲）廣州爲華南重鎭，港澳爲我國門戶，我政府自西遷重慶後，關於友邦物資之輸送，眾械之接濟，殆以此爲唯一之途徑。被吿有見於此，遂定爲兩月駐京，兩月駐粤，凡偽廣東省政府關於軍政大事，皆取決於被吿，觀於該僞廣東省長陳耀祖，對於粤省軍民要政致被吿（崖）各電，事實顯然，推其用意，無非爲斷絕我政府物資之來源，削弱我抗戰之力量，以助長敵人侵略之進展，其心可誅，其情尤可惡。</p>
<p>（乙）査僞廣東省長陳春圃辭職離粤時，被吿兼程返粤，主政至四閱月之久，一面請派褚逆民誼長粤（見軍委會調查室與被吿談話筆錄及本院似査記錄），其把握政權，可謂不遺餘力。他如收編匪軍首領張逸舟，改編前第四路軍李輔羣，將其調職，以及調派王英儒往泰國，辦理聯絡駐泰日軍事務，又許少榮調任僞粤省委兼民政廳長，何麗聞代理僞汕頭市長等事，均須報由被吿及汪逆核准，其與汪逆同惡相濟，自可概見（見陳　祖致崖電及致明崖等電）。</p>
<p>（丙）査僞中央執行委員會特務委員特工總部華南區本部廖公劭及陳賡廷曁簡樹等之各項情報，均係分別專報被吿鑒核，則華南特工情報爲被吿一人主持，自可認定。如廖公劭報吿中，有戰區　港澳之門戶，欲控制渝蔣在港之活動，開展和平之力量，舍此莫屬。陳賡廷報吿中，有因奮鬥而求和平，趨勢如萬馬在潮。又華僑存款，昔日趣向重慶政府，今則擁護於和平旗幟之下。簡樹報吿中，有奉命召集和運同志，負責特務工作之各項荒謬言論，該被吿自不得以從來不看特工報吿等空言，諉卸其罪責。</p>
<p>（丁）査偽二十師高漢宗任參謀長，又調任汪屺爲僞民政廳長，郭衛民爲僞警務處長，周應湘兼僞廣州市長，均須得日寇聯絡部長矢崎及軍司令官酒井等之同意。他如籌辦計口授糧，普通糧食配給及交通。經濟。敎育等行政，亦須矢崎·酒井等之核准（有陳耀祖致崖各電可考）。用人行政一切，惟敵寇之命是從，其通謀敵國，反抗本國，就此觀察，尤爲顯著。</p>
<p>綜上所述，被吿實犯懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款之罪，爰依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條，刑事訴訟法第二百二十條第一項提起公訴，相應送請依法審判。檢察官　維淸，書記官王步雲，由華民國三十五年三月二十七日。</p>
<h3>浙贛兩省府改組　任命沈鴻烈王陵基為主席　甯夏靑海建財兩廳長易人</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕重慶訊：昨日中常會延緩討論。政院各部改組及一部要員內外互調問題，顯示政府正以嚴肅之心情，準備執行政治協商會議改組政府之各項決議。惟有少數省級行政機構之人事問題，即將於行政院常會中提出討論，聞皖省府決改組。政府要員目前所最關心者，爲外交問題及團結統一呼聲中之未來趨勢，對本身之進退，已淡視之。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿六日電〕政院廿六日例會決議：（一）浙省府委兼主席黄紹竑另有任用，應予免職，任命沈鴻烈爲浙省府委兼主席。（二）贛省府委兼主席曹浩森另有任用，應予免職，任命王陵基爲贛省府委兼主席。</p>

<h3>聯合國安理會議第一幕　美蘇起激烈爭論　蘇要求勿討論伊朗問題　英美兩國代表一致反對</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二十六日廣播：全世界命運所緊之安全理事會第二屆大會，巳於今日下午四點零七分（格林威治時間，即上海時間二十七日零點零七分）展開第一幕矣。貝爾納斯出席，坐於美代表史退丁紐斯之旁，貝氏原無座位，在最後一分鍾始由會場添座。開會後，蘇聯代表葛羅米柯發表演說，反對六會將伊朗置於議程之內。據稱：在舊金山傳言及聯合國第一屆大會中，蘇聯代表巳將蘇方之立塲加以闡明，在各該項聲明中，蘇聯巳言明聯合國在維護世界安全與和平方面之重要性，目前蘇方之態度，絕無變動，關於此點，史達林元帥巳在對記者談話中，予以證實，蘇聯等同各國平等，反對任何國統治其他國家。至此，葛羅米柯建議大會，勿將伊朗問題置於議程之內，並宣佈三月廿四日，蘇軍繼續自伊朗撤退，除非發生「意外事件」，蘇軍之撤退工作，可於五星期或六星期內完成。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯旋起立，反對蘇代表之建議，力主將伊朗問題加入議程中。據謂：伊朗巳將上項問題提交安全理事會，並指出蘇聯之舉動，實巳威脅世界安全與和平。伊朗駐美大使曾於三月十八日函美政府，聲明蘇軍在三月二日後繼續留駐伊朗，並干涉伊朗內政，目前蘇方雖巳聲稱與伊朗獲得協議，但蘇伊既未聯合向安全理事會提出聲明，我人不應拒絕聆取伊朗問題之爭辯。</p>
<p>至此，英代表賈德干亦起立致詞，聲明英方完全同意貝爾納斯之主張。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二十六日廣播：英外相貝文巳將新聞令電致出席安全理事會之英代表賈德干，在傳言中向蘇代表葛羅米柯提出五項詢問：　說明撤離伊朗之真相，　撤退前談判經過，　伊朗總理所接受之條件，　蘇軍未能依照一九四二年協定於三月二日前撤退之理由，　說明蘇方所稱「如無意外事件」一語之真義。聞美方代表亦將提出同樣之質詢。</p>
<p>又訊：上星期日起，蘇軍巳自伊朗北部撤退，由坦克四十輛前導，越有蘇軍一千五百名之卡車巳撤離格蘭。</p>

<h3>貝爾納斯致詞　須遵照聯合國憲章　以達到和平之途徑</h3>
<p>（美國新聞處紐約二十六日電）安全理事會昨日舉行會議時，美貝爾納斯親致歡迎詞，並宣讀杜魯門總統之歡迎詞。</p>
<p>杜魯門歡迎詞</p>
<p>「余代表美國人民，對安全整整會各理事國代表，聯合國機構忔長及其同僚等蒞臨敝國，謹致歡迎之意。聯合國機構選擇敝國以爲會址，吾人深以爲榮，吾人將竟其所能，以使諸君起居安適如意。但聯合國苟不能住持戰時爲爭取和平與自由而共同作戰之精神，繼續團結與合作，則無論何處，皆無聯合國機構置身之安適所在。美國人民　特願望諸君美滿成功，抑且願對諸君保證吾人定能精誠合作，以加強聯合國機構之力量與意志，俾在此互相依存之世界中得能維持和平與自由。」</p>
<p>貝氏之歡迎詞</p>
<p>此際誠爲世界史上極關重要之瞬間，安全理事會召開此次會議後，即將依照聯合國憲章之規定，經常執行其任務矣。職是之故，凡爲該會理事國，理應派遣代表，隨時留駐該一機構之所在地，此點十分重要，蓋理事會之任務即在隨時保衛世界和平也。本人（貝爾納斯自稱）確信維護憲章，乃美國人民之堅定決心，至於團結一致從事保衛和平與法律之聯合國人民，想亦必具有同樣之決心。憲章並未使古代特權成爲神聖不可侵犯，同時在瞬息萬變之世界中，該憲章亦並未使任何變動成爲不僉，憲章巳規定大小國家避免訴諸武力或以武力威脅，但爲保衛公法者則除外。在解決糾紛時，各國應一若個人竭力避免訴諸戰爭，但任何國家均無權爲所欲爲，若糾紛不能用友好之談判獲得解決，應提交安全理事會，此亦即安全理事會必須繼續活動之原因。我人苟欲聯合國持久，則任何國家均不應利用何種藉口或需要而爲所欲爲。維護和平與安全之最　重責任，巳降於安全理事會之身，該會必需處理若干問題，而該項問題，乃以前各國曾準備作戰之因素，與安全理事會合作使其完成任務，此乃聯合國各會員之職責，各國必須以自由及坦白之方式在安全理事會中討論其申訴。凡有關世界和平之問題均不應成爲一種不能討論之榮譽問題，個人間之榮譽問題，巳不再用決鬥方式解決之，因此國與國之間之榮譽問題，亦不應在戰場上謀取解決。我人必須遵照憲章而生活，此爲到達和平之途徑，而和平之途徑亦即全世界人仕所願意遵循者，我人在此集議，其目的在完成對國民之職責，我人必不能使彼等失望。</p>

<h3>一位聰明美麗的意大利女郎　女間諜貝安卡　她說：她的美色，引起了許多緾繞；許多人因爲愛不到她而對她憎恨。</h3>
<p>— 本報廣州特派員　梁風</p>
<p>「貝安卡被捕了，這個美麗的女間諜」。</p>
<p>「貝安卡真是一個婦間諜嗎」？</p>
<p>「貝安卡比較川島芳了窨誰漂亮，誰厲害呢？」</p>
<p>「貝安卡………」</p>
<p>這像小說一般的新聞，不但遍登在廣州各報章上；貝安卡的名字更掛在茶樓酒館裏和街頭巷尾每一個廣州市的民的嘴邊，成爲他們最好的談話資料。</p>
<p>在去年十一月十二日那天，從上海到廣州的一班飛機，載來了一位號稱西文第一號病人的意大利女郎。這女郎出身是意大利的貴族，她的父親是義國的海軍少將，她的叔父是御林軍團長；她的美色曾顛倒了不少各色各樣的男人。聽說曾經有一個日本人將好的歷史來寫過一篇很動人的小說，後來譯成英文本在歐洲很流行。這小說的名稱就是「一個意大利女郎甜蜜的夢」。</p>
<p>現在，這小說的主人翁，也正是這充滿了小說性的女間諜案的主角，她的名字就呌做貝安卡（Bianca　Sannion）。</p>
<p>貝安卡是怎樣被發覺的呢？她是從我政府在審訊上海被捕的敵人間諜中，由敵人間諜供出她的名字和罪狀，我政府便馬上通信嚴密緝拿，廣州行營方面果然偵得了她的行踪，便將她秘密監視；女間諜的貝安卡自然是最敏感的，她見廣州風聲不好，便在去年十二月間，想秘密乘飛機逃往上海，怎知飛機還沒有起航，她便給我當局派人在機塲將她逮捕，到現在已經四個月了，曾經由行營秘密的審計過她一次，但外間完全不知道的。到最近她因爲神經錯亂，失去常態，請求出外調治，在三月五日下午五點鍾，她才被送到長堤的博濟醫院去。到三月十六日，敏銳的新聞記者們，終於把這消息找到了，十七日在各報章上披露了這納粹女間諜貝安卡被捕的消息。</p>
<p>關於貝安卡的罪狀，在她被拘留的四個月來，當局自然是搜集了不少資料；不過還未經正式審訊，自然不能發表。現據記者從各方搜集得來的大慨是這樣：貝安卡是義籍女郎，年廿五歲，是個日本間諜，能通義、英、日等國言語，更能說流利的廣東話。一九四三年她在上海與日本的軍要往來，曾和日本外事處處長　藤（負責特務工作者）及日海軍特務部長小谷中校等同居，與日華兩特務機關的主腦矢崎少將過從甚密，同時和日特務人員高橋、大口等也同居過；去年她在廣州的時候，她又跟法國維琪政府駐粵領事西門同居。在上海廣州香港等地淪陷期間，她竟能乘坐日本軍用飛機艦船僕僕往來於上海、廣州、廣州灣間，異常活動。那時這些地方全在敵人掌握，假如不是和敵人有有關係的話，能夠讓她這麽隨便往來，而且使用敵人的軍用交通工具嗎？所以說根據我們所知上述幾點，就知道這位美麗的意大利女郎，自然不是一個尋常的人物了！</p>
<p>十八日下午，在沈鬱而寂寞的博濟醫院裏，記者得晤到這位哄動廣州的女間諜貝安卡。她是住在二樓第八號房間，房子琿寬敞，東北兩面都有窗，和外有疏落的綠樹。在屏風後面，便是貝安卡的睡床。她，尖長的臉龐，兩頰緋紅地，那雙藍中帶黑的眼睛，有若秋水盈盈，襯托着那柔軟的金發，一種嫵媚的姿態，確實是極富誘惑感的天生尤物。那時她是躺在床上，蓋着一床白被單，露出了一雙雪白的臂膀，她的膚色更是清瑩光潔，彷彿像一位法國女郎。她曾對記者陳訴好的身世，她堅說她不是任何國家的女間諜，她還說她是中國人。她自從嫁給中國人譚屐超後，即入了中國籍，在義時曾生有一子一女，六年前携子女來上海，後來又生了兩個女孩。納粹發動了戰爭以後她又曾到香港，香港政府曾因爲她是義籍，不能留駐英國屬地，要她離境。到一九四二年她再回香港，那時生活甚苦，便由香港到廣州，想往廣州灣轉桂林去找尋她的丈夫；就在這時候爲了要領護照的關係，和西門認識了。但到廣州灣後一星期，因爲到桂林路程太遠了，便又折回廣州，爲了生活關係，時常由西門給她一兩千元僞幣這樣來維持。不久得到她丈夫陣亡的消息，她才和西門同居，又生了一個孩子。現在她那個八歲兒子巳死亡了，一個九歲和六歲四歲幾個幼女都在上海法國教會友人替她撫養。最後她還說，她的丈夫譚先生，現在也在廣州，還天天都去探望她的哩！</p>
<p>在她那短短的說話裏，却加插了不少不同的表情；說到高興的時候，她瞪大了眼睛，提高了嗓子，像是無限的興奮；但有時却又眨眨眼，伸伸勃子，像想哭的模樣；而有時更又作深沈的回憶。她的話曾誇張了她每每因爲她的美色而引起許多人纏擾，又說許多人因爲愛不到她而對她憎恨；祇可惜她的作僞；但記者總不禁這樣想：好一個善變的女間諜呵！（未完）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>伊朗局勢的新開展</h3>
<p>聯合國安全理事會於一昨召開於紐約，由我國代表離泰祺氏任主席。此會之召開，各方因伊朗局勢之惡化，曾寄予相當期望，以爲聯合國機構對處理國際紛爭能否有效，胥以處理此次伊朗局勢爲斷。乃不意於安全理事會召開前三小時，蘇聯突取驚人行動，伊朗當局正式證實蘇軍巳開始自伊撤退；抑憂態莫斯科電電廣播稱，蘇伊巳獲致協議。另據聯合社倫敦廿四日電，據莫斯科電台廣播，則稱：「按照戰時與伊朗所訂條約，蘇英美三國軍隊應於三月二日退出伊朗，英美兩軍皆巳如期撤退，蘇聯早先曾宣布於三月三十一日撤兵，梅希克·沙魯特及山南等處蘇軍同三月二日起開始撤退，業巳完畢，其餘蘇軍按照蘇仞協定，於三月廿四日起開始撤退。此項撤兵消息，倫敦各界聞之頗爲震動。」此項消息之突如其來，我們不得不讚歎蘇聯　這外交手腕的靈活；因此消息，使聯合國安全整整會代表轉悲爲喜，同時，又多少使世界各國人士對此番聯合國理事會之　　，　少其興趣。此後聯合國安全理事會對於伊朗局勢是否再應　　討論，我們無從測知；但據合衆社紐約廿五日電，則謂　國　　　將　　　　討論，並主張任何蘇伊問題之解決，應由理事會批准。美國國務卿貝爾納　堅持下列數點：　理事會　　伊蘇兩國　　解決　　報告：　　　報告應使各國代表深信兩國間所成立之協定，係出於雙方誠意，而非出於威脅者；　蘇聯對理事會之報告，應視爲聯合國機構及伊朗所成立之協議相同。</p>
<p>與蘇聯自伊朗撤兵的消息同時傳來的，還有法國新聞社德黑蘭廿四日電，謂伊朗右派領袖逃出德黑蘭者爲數甚衆，有埃特雷脫黨領袖台却帝，右派領袖沙夫普魯爾，聞巳逃往倫敦。又據合衆社廿五日德黑蘭電，則謂阿塞爾拜然省的自主運動將獲得伊朗政府的認許。假如我們拿蘇聯的撤兵，伊朗右派政治領袖的出亡，與夫阿塞爾拜然自主運動的認可這幾件報道併在一起，以觀察伊朗局勢的新開展，似不難知其動向與其間的微妙關係。</p>
<p>首先我們要指出的是伊朗問題是一種國際問題。爲了進行反軸心的作戰，英蘇美三國協議駐軍伊朗。當蘇聯與納粹作戰的時候，美國對蘇聯租借法安的物資，很多經由伊朗轉蘇聯。迨納粹投降，英美蘇相約自伊朗撤兵，英美如期撤了，而蘇聯與伊朗地壤相接，不但不曾遵約撤兵，反而加緊軍事活動，同時又在蘇聯軍占領區內出現了所謂阿塞爾拜然的自主運動。伊朗向在倫敦集會的聯合國機構申訴，而蘇聯去堅持審伊蘇間的問題，應由伊蘇直接交涉；其後伊總理訪問莫斯科，蘇聯當局却又予以冷談，直接交涉無效，而蘇聯又復進兵伊朗。這種書面一直倒掛到安全理事會召開的前夕。一手掩盡天下人耳目，終究是不可能的；世界輿論，對於蘇聯之行動，無不憤激，蘇聯看到這種局勢，除一方面要求安全理事會延期外，這當然又碰到中英美等國的反對，一方面我們看見有史達林委員長與聯合社記者的談話，表示信賴聯合國機構，謀世界和平。這是在這種情形下，蘇聯於安全理事會召開前三小時突有自伊朗撤兵消息的宣布。</p>
<p>我們倘要問蘇聯此次的行動，其動機及意義何在，這似乎有失忠厚之道，但從各種關於伊朗的消息彙合起來，而且關於伊朗內部的消息依舊是相當簡陋而混沌的，約略可知伊朗局勢的動向。右派政治領袖的出亡，這所反映的無疑地是親蘇份子及左派的抬頭，阿塞爾拜然自主運動的得到認可，此則將來是否與蘇聯的阿塞爾拜然共和國合併，我們固不必加以預測，無疑地又是一種分化運動的成功。綜上諸端，可知一種親蘇的政權上預備在伊朗出現；而這本來是一種國際問題的伊朗局勢，却將演變成爲內政問題因而喪失其國際性。此項謀略之成功，將使聯合國機構不復再有顧問伊朗局勢的可能。</p>
<p>於此，使我們聯想到東北的局勢，蘇軍的撤離瀋陽及東北其它地區，不也與伊朗的撤兵同樣的奇突神妙。東北問題本來也是國際問題，近來不也有演變爲內政問題的跡象？異曲同工，可歎觀止。我們要提高國人及國際間對於這種局勢的警覺。</p>

<h3>離婚夫婦涉訟　為的是女孩撫育費</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市有外僑猶太人名伊薩克士者（Isaacs）原係巡捕，今則爲龍華飛機場美軍之機械士，曾於兩年半前，經過法律手續，與其妻魯意沙（Louisa）宣吿離婚有小女兒一，判歸魯意莎撫育，當時言明每月由伊付與魯僞幣二百元，作爲女孩之撫育費，更曾經雙方同意，將此女孩寄養於外灘的瑟聖心院，每月由魯往繳寄養費後又經雙方同意，小女孩之撫育費，增至每月僞幣四百元。迨本年一月，魯向地院控訴要示增加小女孩之撫育費，地院受理，曾於上月二十日判決：自今年一月起，小女孩之撫育費，每月爲國幣二萬元，昨日上午，並由馮美學推事，開庭執行。伊魯兩人及伊所聘之中國律師一人均出庭，然伊僅肯繳一萬元，理由爲據約瑟聖心院報吿，魯每月並不將由伊處領用之撫育費繳納該院，今已拖欠至十四個月之久，故該院已通知伊，促其將女孩領出。其律師亦聲稱：伊每月僅領七十元美金之薪金，若每月付兩萬元，則折合其薪金七分之一，不堪負担，故已上訴於高院。魯意莎約三十五六歲，聞伊不肯繳納六萬元，（即一月至三月之撫育費）乃操流利之上海話，在法庭上大吵大鬧後經法官判伊當庭付一萬元，並由書記官代寫一收據，其餘之五萬元，則令伊須於四月一日開庭執行時付淸，方悻悻而去。</p>

<h3>台灣行政長官陳儀　談台灣一般現狀　今後注重恢復農工業　促進對外貿易之發展</h3>
<p>台灣行政長官陳儀，因公自台飛渝，二十四日公畢抵滬，記者昨特趨訪陳氏私邸，當蒙接見，叩詢台灣一般現狀，承示甚詳。</p>
<p>建設工作開始進行</p>
<p>陳氏稱：台灣五十餘年受日本統治，人民思想，束縛甚深，對國內政治，經濟，文化各方面建設情形，頗多隔閡，尤以語言複雜，在敎育上影響殊大。勝利以後，本人奉命主　，首即以推行國語敎育，列爲重要工作之一，現全台中小學校均已復校復課，敎科用書，均係採用國語敎學，語言文字，逐漸統一，台灣現有人口，計漢人五百七十萬人，多閩廣一帶移民，土著二十二萬人，內平浦族六萬人，（俗稱熟番），高山民族十六萬人（俗稱生番），實際上土著均已漢化，僅方言不同而已。地方向無特殊政治組織，所有治安，敎育，衛生工作，以往均由日本警察管理，最近正計劃推行地方自治工作。日人居留台灣者，原有六十餘萬人，內日俘十八萬人，眷屬六萬人，日僑三十二萬人，日俘現已全部遣送回國，日僑正陸續分批遣返，祇剩三萬人。台灣技術人才及行政管理人才，現頗缺乏，台灣行政幹部訓練團成立後，才荒問題，已逐漸解決，大部均係就近取才，以期適應需要。綜括言之，台灣政治現狀頗爲安定，各部門建設工作，正開始進行。</p>
<p>肥料缺乏向美訂購</p>
<p>至於經濟方面，陳氏稱：戰爭期間，台灣工業，遭受敵人榨取剝削，殘破不堪。勝利前夕，迭遭轟炸，損失甚鉅。接收後，重工業如冶金，冶鋼，煉鋁，煉油等工廠，均已復工，但機器多係日本製造，零件損壞，配置殊難。輕工業如麻織，造紙，水泥等工廠，多已恢復原有生產標準，預料一年以後，大規模工業始能逐漸發展，台灣農業，每年需要硫酸錏肥料四十萬噸，以往均係日本供給，勝利後來源斷絕，肥料驟感恐慌，故今年糧食歉收，台灣每年米產三熟，可收一千七百餘萬石，往年輸人日本五百餘萬石，尙餘一千餘萬石，自給有餘，今年祇產九百萬石，全部自給，尙不足七十萬石，祇好以雜糧補充，維持民食。台灣雜糧，每年可產一百萬噸，今年甘蔗種地不廣，祇產十萬噸，僅能自給。爲迅速恢復農業生產起見，目前已向美國加拿大洽購肥料，下半年可獲得二十萬噸之硫酸錏供給，預料明年農產，當可豐收。</p>
<p>金融安定物平穩</p>
<p>合灣金融現頗安定，公務人員匯款比率，暫以台幣一元，折法幣三十元計算。又美軍用票一元，現兌台幣一元，折合美金，爲台幣十五元，兌美金一元，幣値穩定，物價當不致劇烈波動。惟因交通困難，台灣對外貿易尙未展開，若干特產仍無法輸出。至於今後建設台灣計劃，陳氏特列舉四點：（一）恢復農工業（二）發展高等教育（台灣無大學），（三）恢復交通，（四）促進對外貿易。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕陳氏定日內飛返任所，又長官公署職員，一批一千二百人，由滬乘台北輪已於本月廿一日抵台。</p>

<h3>人腿一條眞相大白</h3>
<p>醫院中病人截下之足</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕北四川路九六一號上海實騐戲劇學校內游泳池旁，前日下午二時許，發現人腿一條，該腿業已呈現一部份之腐爛狀態。經人報吿北四川路警察分局，由分局長曾德榮偕刑事股股長周南率領巡官劉兆年警長陳峻峯前往出事地點査勘，結果瞥見該腿係屬一男子右腿，雖一部份血肉糢糊，不易鑑定，然細察皮肉，不像苦力者，但亦不如文人模樣。惟骨部狠光滑，好像用鋸子截去。當經周股長率陳警長外出，至比隣（前福民醫院）上海市立第四醫院詢問，最近有何人鋸去腿足？據答稱：三四日前有一人鋸去右腿一條，該病者現住樓上一百十號房間，係救濟總署送來一士兵，名高明春，因該腿折傷後，醫藥罔效，經醫師診斷須鋸去。嗣施用手術，將腿截去後，置於後面太平間內。因戲劇學校與該院僅一鐵門之隔，被一惡犬銜出，置於荒塲上，至血肉糢糊，想被犬噬之故。嗣經該院施醫師馳往認明無訛，當即携回，至此始釋疑團。</p>
<h3>新聞紙及週刊暫停航空寄遞</h3>
<p>上海郵政管理局頃通吿稱：准中國航空公司上海辦事處本年三月十五日公函略稱：「本公司對於各地郵局交運之航空郵件，祗收交運之航空信件，至於航空包裏及新聞紙等，應即通知寄遞人，直接向本公司上海辦事處接洽，如飛機有容量時，則按照貨運價格收取運費載運」等由，准此，迭經本局與該公司商洽，迄未獲有結果。截至日前止，本局已積存寄各地新聞紙袋甚多，無法淸運，故本局不得不自即日起，將所有去滬渝，及滬粵·滬平及滬台航綫各地之新聞紙及週刋，暫停收寄。又廿九日爲例假日。管理局曁各支局之辦公鐘點，悉照星期日定例辦理。</p>

<p>公會理事長發表談話</p>
<p>關於電影加價事，頃據電影院商業同業公會理事長梁其田談，戲票加價，實爲不得已之舉，良以各項開支激增，苟不加以調整，各院勢難維持。然目下售價，仍較其他物價爲廉，即以娛樂業而論，戰前遊藝塲最高價兩角，今售三百元，話劇最高偎一元，今售二千五，電影最高價二元，今售一千八，且一千八百元之中，除去代徵娛樂稅百分之五十，計六百元，繳納印花稅百分之十，計一百二十元，片商對拆五百四二十元，院方實得亦祗五百四十元。</p>

<h3>中原染織廠發起　對敎職員發售特價品</h3>
<p>憑特價購買證享優待的權利</p>
<p>編輯先生：見近日報載，神聖的敎職員為了生活問題，希望得到一個稍為合理的解次，發生了怠敎的情事，我們站在國民立塲上，對於這嚴重問題，不得不關心起來。抗戰是勝利了，然而國家財政正在艱難困苦時期，對這問題，恐難立即予以補救，尤其是學生們的家長，對兒女支出的學費，大都也是勉强支付，補收當然談不到，然而生活指數和敎職員的薄酬收入，事實是脫節太多，怠敎風潮，將成爲整個的社會問題。我們本屬一個生產機構，也是現社會中的一份子，願自動光來對神聖的教職員們效些微的貢獻，雖然是微乎其微，但是各方面都能同樣辦起來，敎職員的生活負担多少總可以减輕一些，現在姑且擬個辦法；凡本市公私立各級學校的敎職員，由學校當局向各日用品生產工廠接洽，普遍發給他們一張日用品特價購買證，憑證能享受一個特價優待的權利，以减輕支出的負祖，我們中原染織廠出品雙十牌面巾及各種棉織物品，自吿奮勇，願意來一個嘗試，如果其他日用品工廠採取同樣辦法，確實可以使敎職員們生活方面得到一些帮助，不知讀者以爲何如？敬請　撰安</p>

<h3>同業無人申請登記　金市萎靡不振　外幣以新港票最熱</h3>
<p>烚赤昨以中行有所供給，黑市來源不斷，配給價雖　立一六〇萬，未曾更動，同業亦未登記，大勢無望，賣戶畏縮不前，過程始終疲軟，晨開平穩，開後即有某種壓力增加，漸漸回落，十時後中行配給價未更，業中以市價低落，無人前往登記，無如壓力頻仍，市况遂逐步萎靡，午刻退至一五四萬，而後稍有回好，惟爲時至暫，午後仍吿不支，先疲後穩，結果較前收微挫一萬五，飾金掛十七萬元，紋銀一千六，銀元一〇五〇元有買，勢甚穩定，暗拆平平，息價自一角六分至二角不等，中行存金豐富，投機商無法活動，金市呈明平暗疲之象，趨勢難振。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔初　後疲，最開在一九八〇元光景徘徊，入後金市步跌，美鈔亦被帶小，午刻在一九六〇元光景，午後金市低後復升，美鈔則仍以低價結束，較前收跌二三十元，港票老疲莫能只，再跌十元，新貨復稍挺昇，雖無新刺激，籌碼較涸，易於拉上，36年一度升至二三五元而後稍回，37年流通較多，落後達二十元，結果回升十元及二十元，港電羅比均平靜。</p>
<h3>多頭相繼脫手證劵倐然回跌　華股因川帮不肯放午收又見恢復原狀</h3>
<p>公債昨業中大戶欲擒故縱，上塲即抬，丙種自晨開三〇〇〇元後，一度哄抬至三一五〇元左右，多方乃感滿足，連袂脫手，不久即破入三千元關內，華股等市亦因多頭了結而疲，債市散戶恐慌，供過於求，步降至二六〇〇元，午收略平，較前收計甲乙丁戊均跌二百元，丙種最熱獨跌三百元光景，華股形勢恍惚，多頭有一部份出籠，中途跌風頻仍，無如川帮籌碼搯住不放，運用其龐大資力，低價有所加碼，市上流動籌碼愈做愈少，對敲號家臨收爲抵補頭寸，有所補進，重又向榮，低價時永紗爲四六〇〇元，美亞三五八〇元，景福破入三百元關，午收仍能恢復原狀，較前收計熱門各股稍有上升，冷落小股則平平，午後隔日交易永紗美亞景禍喊價扳高半成至一成不等，外股開市較遲，適逢華股債市回風，上塲即露頽勢，怡紗自一〇二〇〇元步降至九六〇〇元，最後在一萬元關徘徊，結果較前收下挫半成至一成左右。</p>
<h3>米油平穩　麺粉幼轉呆</h3>
<p>米市昨早雖喊緊，惟河貨尙有存樻，店胃動而不旺，結果依然彷彿，麵粉外埠消胃轉呆，形勢軟化，油價以來貨絡續有到，趨勢平平，黄豆高定次疲，到消兩淡，生仁仍穩，苞米貨稀頗靈活，價升七八百元，麩皮亦漲二三百元，豆餅平疲，各糧大多平平而已。</p>
<h3>廣帮進胃漸弱紗綫一致回降</h3>
<p>昨日紗市又轉萎靡，廣帮進胃巳漸轉弱，廿支特雙馬跌至一百十萬，京帮對址支粗紗擇廉而取，布廠及織廠因製成品銷路呆滯，無意多進，是以各支紗綫回降二三萬，脚地仍未見穩，紡建照例開售棉布共計十一種，並加開美國布十種。</p>
<h3>現棉交易尙佳</h3>
<p>昨日紐的美棉續昂六至十二磅音，計近期美金二七·〇八，遠期無市，米特林現貨二七·七六，本埠現棉交易尙佳，惟市况依然無生氣，緣紗布市况均吿下游，廠家不肯放價吸收，執貨者咸有遷就態度，僅紡建公司進米特林花一千五六百包，價由七萬六至七萬八又八萬元，民營紗廠與花號未聞做開。</p>
<h3>絲綢買戶觀望　人造絲跌去六萬</h3>
<p>昨市絲綢一致疲軟，實因買戶皆存觀望，大都有價而無成交，廠絲八十分以上勻度洋行貨，昨有接洽價每祖二百五十五萬元，不過貨款遷就打幾日期票，另担與干經，乏人過問，喊價俱短，人造絲一二〇號天橋開盤一百七十四萬元，後即下挫一百七十萬元收盤，較上日短六萬元，無光半光，貨缺價扳住，一二〇號賴司端無光二百七十八萬元有成交，綢市美亞被面價與上日相同，惟毫無交易，大誠格子璧縐廠方拋售，價較上日短一百元弱，生意尙稱不惡，電力紡及二〇五洋紡貨色高低不齊，價目亦大相縣殊。</p>
<h3>元釘續跌</h3>
<p>元釘客銷向稱極盛，惟近半月來客帮購買力有限，因此市况愈趨愈下，較二週前又軋跌一二成左右，現四分每桶售九萬二千元，五分售八萬二千元，六分沽七萬二千元，一寸開六萬五千元，寸半六萬元，二寸爲五萬三千元，二寸半及三寸每桶售五萬元</p>
<h3>煤市平靜　煤球廠盤仍穩</h3>
<p>煤市交易淡泊，僅零星尙有點綴，市况漸轉平靜，行情少有起仆，白煤篩塊現市籌碼雖缺，但因市價過高，致礙實銷，問津者少，形成供求兩缺，行市續微跌一萬元，煤球主要原料大山　及白煤層等雖連日回降頗巨，但廠方因人工開支激增，又因通日春雨綿綿，各廠生產减少及烘柴步漲，故市價仍穩站高盤，一時尙難回落。</p>
<h3>美國需銻甚殷　所惜限價太低</h3>
<p>（路透社紐約二十六日電）銻在美國目前甚感缺乏，唯一補救辦法有賴於中國所產大量銻鑛之重返美國市塲。惟現時世界市塲上銻之價格遠較美國國內之限價爲高，故美國似有獎勵國人向中國購買銻之必要。</p>

<h3>茶銷淡泊</h3>
<p>明前新龍井，以浙江溫州出產最早，大致本月底或可嘗新，惟據產地消息，去歲候雖不嚴寒，然今庚在新茶即將生育之際，春雨迎綿不斷，因此出產恐受影響，收成未許樂觀，至於日來本市茶葉市况，天津各地及本街店莊之走銷均極淡泊，而一般賣戶獲利頻有鬆脫，趨勢在供多求少下，市勢萎頓，價格方面，迄少起色。</p>
<h3>蘇聯黃金產量　戰事時期反較戰前增加　金準備約及美國五之一</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約二十六日電〕蘇聯爲主要產金國家之一，但從不公佈生產量數字，據保羅胡爾在紐的先鋒講壇報著論稱，蘇聯之金準備其數量僅次於美國，一九三六年蘇聯爲國際聯盟會員國時，聯盟統計年鑑所載蘇聯之金準備爲四七·三七一·〇〇〇盎司，據美國鑛產局估計，一九三六年蘇聯產量爲五百萬盎司，自一九三七年至一九四五年年底，蘇聯之產量當有七千一百五十萬盎司，其中出口者僅有四百萬盎司，由此佔計，蘇聯之金準備當有一萬二千萬盎司，約及美國金準備百分之二十一，據胡爾根據蘇聯所雇用外國工程師之報吿加以估計，目前蘇聯之黄金產量與南非洲相等，或且過之，按一九四四年南非洲所產黄金計一千二百萬盎司，據蘇聯刊物所公佈，戰時蘇聯之黄金產量較前增加，適與世界其他各地相反。</p>
<h3>活動房屋</h3>

<h3>今後閩台師資源泉　福建師專縮寫</h3>
<p>— 黃岑</p>
<p>在過去，福建的文化敎育是比較落後的。撇開高等敎育不說，單以中等學校來講：據戰前統計，實足不滿六十校；而其中又儘多是敎會創辦的與私人開設的私校，實際公立中學宛若鳳毛麟角，而這些中學又都凑攏在福州，莆田，厦門各主要地區，若閩東閩西等地十餘縣毫至沒有一所高中。恰好抗戰給福建帶來了不甘落伍的願望，在動亂中它却慢慢抬起頭來。閩省的敎育常局也在最初六年中逐步完成了它的計劃，一方而儘量扶助了各縣敎育的獨立發展，使每縣至少有一縣立初中和簡易師範班，一方而按照行政區劃分全省爲九個中學區，使每區至少有了一所完全中學，普通師範學校，以及按照各地特殊需要，而設立農業，水產，醫護，工業等職業學校。這些計劃推行的結果，閩省中等敎育及普及上無疑是已經做到，然而，也究竟因爲量的過度膨脹做成質的逐漸低落。於是這所為謀解決整個師資問題的「福建師範專科學校」便應運而生。</p>
<p>已往歷史</p>
<p>師專的前身是前福建省主席陳　手裏創設的「中敎師資養成所」。原址在沙縣。當時設有文史地，數理化，音樂，體　等幾科。專門招收高中師範畢業生以及選拔各縣優秀小敎前來進修。修業期間是兩年。畢業後，由省分派到各縣中學服務。在校期間，舉凡膳食衣着均由省方發給，故常時各地淸貧學子多樂於就讀。及至民國卅一年間，爲鑒於原有規模不敷擴展，乃改為省立師專。校址改遷南平之水南後谷一個小邨里。首任校長是唐守議氏。名小說家章靳以，畫家吳茀之諸先生等，都在此時執敎過。</p>
<p>內部組織</p>
<p>現在師專已擴展成國文·史地·數理化·敎育·藝術·體　等六科，本學期遷至福州，更添設一英文科，聘林天蘭博士為主任。惟該校為適應實際敎學需要起見，除藝童兩科外，科目各科可以互選，例如國文科可兼選史地英文，史地科可兼選國文英文，敎育科可兼選國文史地等。學業亦採用學分制，三年畢業。招生辦法有二種，一爲各縣保送「經有高中同等學校畢業資格」之優秀小敎人員，一爲高中及普通師範畢業生。絕對不收同等學力。現任校長爲閔省參議長林希濂氏，唯實際校務均爲敎務主任嚴琥辦理。（按嚴某係嚴復先生哲嗣，對國文一科因有家學淵　，造詣甚深）。校內設四處一室。敎授人選，昔因區域限制，未能盡如理想，今後遷榕，當可另謀解決。</p>
<p>學生活動</p>
<p>學生人數，已將達四百人，大抵均為師範畢業生。他們有的已服務社會達八九年，當過校長·科長·參　員，然後重返學府之門的，故經騐·學識·能力，均較豐富。在學業方面：因一踏出校門，即將爲人師表，故二三年級同學幾乎終日埋頭書卷問，溫習不敢稍輟。在服務方面：因於平時早已司空過慣，故在技術上率有特殊成績表現。至謂學生活動，則因各種人材均有，故亦特別活躍，例如出版列物印製敎材，文史敎育諸科即可擔當；繪圖測量，史地數理化諸科就能負責。體育競賽，則由體童科獨檔一面。習作展覽，則由藝術科出塲主持。一切均極自動，積極，而且勝任愉快。學生生活一掃都市奢侈習氣，不獨西裝革履猜拳喝酒之舉，在此絕跡，甚至日常衣服食具，均爲同學自洗自理。其間一二學生之刻苦生活，尤足令人怦然感動。</p>
<p>今後計畫</p>
<p>目前，閩省各界因鋻於戰後提高敎育素質必要，皆欲師專改成一師範學院。至其路徑有二：（一）與省立醫農兩學院合併而為「國立林森大學」，使成為閩東北最高學府。（二）建議中央將師專改為獨立學院，使共能適應今後福建台灣兩省師資大批需要。前者迭經閩省參政員向中樞提出，並一度經行政院通過，唯至今尙遲遲不能予以實現。後者經由閩省此次出席二中全會諸君向部面洽，據云可有把握成功。我們察於當前閩省中敎人員枯竭現象，更鑒於台灣今後國語敎育之迫切需求，（按師專兩屆閩南籍同學均佔全數三分之一，以之派赴台灣，敎學言語一項可以迎刃而解），該校實有改院必要，所望敎育當局從速予以支持！</p>

<h3>瀋陽蘇軍撤退總站遭破壞　北寧路無限辛酸</h3>
<p>— 本報瀋陽十八日航訊　特派員韓淸濤寄</p>
<p>北灣路，這條東北新生命綫，在瀋陽蘇軍撤退後的今天，應該全綫通車了，但因總站已被破壞，還是把皇姑屯車站做爲終點，　姑屯和總站不到十里地的距離，仍是「咫尺天涯」，可望不可即呢！</p>
<p>山海關裏面，旅客是很擁擠，路務也需要整頓，山海關到濟陽之間的關外段，更有許多辛酸的遭遇，一般從關內乘車來的旅客，要在錦州換車，寒冷和困苦，襲擊每一個人。</p>
<p>北寗路頂頭的阻塞病，還未痊愈，週身又時常還在發生毛病，毛病的發生，又多半在重要的關節，那就是共軍有計劃的炸橋工作，而使鐵路不能順利暢通。</p>
<p>便衣隊炸橋　即溜之大吉</p>
<p>路綫是遙長的，僅溝帮子到新民間，就有大小橋棵一百多座。除了太長的橋樑，像巨流河大橋等處，專有看守的國軍外，其他的地方不能處處派兵把守。這給了共軍以可乘之機，他們多利用夜間，派上一支便衣隊伍，　着炸藥，走到預定的目標，在轟然　炸聲中，任務達到，溜之大吉，國軍趕到時，他們已經無影無踪了。</p>
<p>近來所炸的趙家村機，饒陽河橋，柳河溝橋，都由橋工把炸毀的地方，臨時從河底用枕木累架　托起來，將來水大的時候，那又怎辦呢？何况還有不斷的破壞呢，這眞不敢使人想下去了。</p>
<p>有人又想到將來「靑紗帳」起來的時候了，六七尺的高梁桿，是隱匿大批人馬的好所在。過去東北夏季胡匪猖獗，這是一大原因，敵人日本，曾不准農人在鐵道兩旁若十里內，種植高梁，以維護鐵路交通，但現在是我們國人自己的事，一切還得自己圖謀合理解決的辦法。</p>
<p>在前北寗路關外段，是雙綫的藏路，除了兩三處橋樑尙沒修成雙綫，得暫時段落單綫通車外，具餘都是上下行車，不受任何阻　，可是，現在好多地方被破壞了，也有的躺着翻落的車頭和車箱，沒能整修和淸除，所以列車在上一站靠左走，到了下一站，也許又須跑在了右方。</p>
<p>車站各設備　竟停止使用</p>
<p>大大小小車站的電氣管理和設備，現在都停止使用了，岔口，燈號，丟的丟，壞的壞，通向站外的電綫，被人拿走了，甚至站外的紅綠燈片也沒有了影，變亂次數越多，這篇糊塗賬越難算。</p>
<p>沿綫各站，站裏站外的檢査等工作，很少有人在作，道岔生銹了沒人管，設備壞了沒人修，整潔，秩序，都是一團糟。一位路員慨嘆的說：「僞滿時代，站長至少每週要檢査一次站務，帶着白手套，如果在道岔上摩着了黄銹，那管理道岔的人員，就吃不消了，所以時時擦，亮光，爽利。唉，現在半年多沒人管了。」記者親自看到一個機車到那裏上煤上水的大站，道岔生了銹，撤通岔的人，費了半天氣力，纔算把差事應付過了。</p>
<p>路員工待遇　正在調整中</p>
<p>所有的路員們，一般的說起來，還是很勤謹，不過路上一切設備，有的被破壞了，有的朽毁了，所以開始了馬虎，大家以應付爲能事，那就糟了。</p>
<p>待遇問題，現在聽說正在調整中，二月份，一個站長纔拿到束北流通券兩千左右，約合國幣二萬六千元，而物價和法幣折合起來，又和內地差不多，吃飯，養家，那怎能够，所以好多站長和路員們，穿的都很襤褸。</p>
<p>一般人的意見，對於路員待遇，千萬要合理，而過去的路上的　則，好的一定要保留下來，維持下去，因爲過去敵僞管理鐵路有條不紊，工作推行，迅速確實，今天，不能把它「一筆勾消」。</p>
<p>凍了大半夜　嬰兒無處尋</p>
<p>路上機車和車皮缺乏，好多的被蘇軍拖走了，每天南北各開一列客車，乘客擁擠異常，車箱內旣無立錐之地，門口也擠得水洩不通，兩軍交接地方，也站滿了人，有的人連抓着的東西也沒有，沒辦法，只得用繩子把自己綁或吊在車上，更慘的是車頂棚上，坐滿了乘客，這在內地或可馬虎過去，這裏是冰天雪地的天氣，火車跑起來，那股寒風，好比刮人的鋼刀，可以凍得僵過去。前些日子，一個女客，從錦州來，凍了大半夜，到溝幫子的時候，太陽高了，纔發覺被褥包裹的兩個月的孩子，沒有了去向！</p>
<p>掛了軍人車　壹節不够用</p>
<p>那來的這些旅客呢？又何以不多加車次呢？答案是：車皮與機車兩感缺乏，能拿什麼在鐵路上跑呢？東北人現在很窮困，所以多來往平津間作小本生意，肩上背着小包貨物，忍受幾乎不能忍受的痛苦，旅客中一半是這種人，另外是探親訪友的，因爲僞滿時代，旅行要受多方的限制，何况關內外又有「國界」之分呢？</p>
<p>軍人公出，來往錦縣和瀋陽間的也頗多，所以單掛一節招待軍人的車箱，還是不够用，遂不得不參雜在普通旅客之間，所以旅客車上，也坐着許多軍人。</p>
<p>遇見大鼻子　危險性更大</p>
<p>人多買票難，那眞是難到了極點。前些日子，錦州開車的時間，是早晨六點鐘，一般乘客都在半夜去排隊，有的夜幕拉下後，就去那裏坐下來，疲倦了，坐着行李或貨物上，打上一個盹，「餐風宿露」，不能形容那種苦狀，因爲現在的關外，還是冰天雪地，寒風刺股呢！</p>
<p>車子到皇姑屯，剛剛黑了天，大家不能走進市區了，因爲在蘇軍未撤退以前，大家都怕遇見了「大鼻子」，不幸的遇到了，大半身上鈔票得奉獻出來，其他的東西也有被拿去的危險，所以只好住店了。</p>
<p>白天自己住　晚間招旅客</p>
<p>皇姑屯本來不是終點，沒有較多旅店，一列車人，都得住比那裏，於是住家戶自己白天睡覺，晚間招住客，每人十五元至卅元（每一元合法幣十三元）的花費，人多了，大家坐着，人少了，可以躺下來，人那能辦呢？因爲第二天上車去錦州的人們，也得趕到這裏宿店，所以皇姑屯家家是店，到處是人，大家受了苦，住戶得到了意外的教穫。大小房子，每天都賺了許多錢。</p>
<p>從三月十六日起，錦州改為十點開車了，車到皇姑屯，得在八九點鐘，正趕上晚間戒嚴，瀋陽晚六點鐘後，天亮以前，很少有人走路的，皇姑屯車站，又是那樣的紛亂，所以改在新民停車了新民車站附近，有正式旅店，可是好多謀取蠅頭之利的商販，多半宿在車箱和車頂，不然的話，旣需花錢，又怕上不來車，這種辦法，在他們看來，已經很滿足了，因爲到底都是中國人，受不到欺凌和打擾，東北同胞的謀生和行路，目前眞是苦不堪言。</p>
<p>北寗路從山海關到瀋陽之間，問題是那樣之多，旅客又是那般的痛苦，需要趕快整頓和圖謀種救改進之方，這條東北新生命綫，是不容許這樣下去的。（三月十八日，瀋陽）</p>
<h3>黯澹的廣州敎育　學齡兒童被摒於校門外</h3>
<p>— 本報廣州廿日航訊　特派員梁風</p>
<p>也許民生凋敝，是戰後所不免的現象吧！廣州社會一切都向畸形發展，面道德墮落，世風日下，尤以今日爲最。但要挽救這頽風，要轉移社會這種壞風氣，改造國民的心理，主要的還是要從敎育着手。因此，在百端待舉的復員聲中，敎育的復員確爲較迫切的工作。</p>
<p>廣州的敎育水準，在戰前估全國第一位，但經過了八年抗戰與敵寇的蹂躪，到現在已每况愈下。此間敎育當局，雖盡過最大的努力，但由於主觀與客觀的條件，這問題仍然是相當的嚴重。</p>
<p>誠然，誰要去統計失學的靑年及兒童的數字，的確頗驚人的，記者曾走訪此問敎育當局調査過，雖然他們給你「未統計過」的答覆，但若據市敎育局長對記者談的一席話，就可以知道大約的數字。他說：「全市失學的兒童數目，尙未統計過、惟苦就民政廰發表本市九十七萬人口來估計，兒童至少要佔五分之一，也就要是至少兒童有二十萬人，除掉有五六萬人因家庭經濟或種種特殊困難，而無法入學者，至少還有十三，四萬學齡兒童需要就　……。」若按照他的說法去類推，學齡的靑年有多少呢。在九十七萬人口內，靑年該佔五分之二吧！那麽就有三十八萬靑年，就算有種種其他特殊的原因而减一半，但至少也有十九萬靑年達到學齡，需要就讀的，</p>
<p>可是學校究竟恢復了多少呢？據調査伶所得，本市專科以上的學校，除開中山大學外有七間，中級學校在廣州光復時僅有廿二所，本學期已增至三十八所，鐵及戰前一半，而市立的僅僅三校，省立的祗有九校。上列各校如每校平均以七八百八計算的話，充其量收客也不會超過五萬人，如此算來，失學靑年，就有十四萬人！</p>
<p>至於小學　，在戰前廣州市立的小學有一百間及一間幼稚園，但現今復原的僅僅四十二間及一間幼稚園，容納兒童根據敎育局公佈，計一萬五千六百五十人，而私立小學竟如雨後春筍般投立，據敎育局（現併社會局第四科）負責人吿記者：私立小學現有六十九間，每間平均以五百人計算，其容量也不過三萬多人，速同市私立小學計算，就學的總共不過四五萬兒童，這樣算來被摒棄在學校門外的兒童，大約有八萬多人了！</p>
<p>而又因爲市立的學校如是之少，私立學校就乘時崛起，高抬學費；雖然敎育局規定，私立學校，高中每學期收費二萬元，初中一萬八千元，小學不得超過七千五百元，但實際上沒有一校不途額收費，且書籍費及平時什費當不在少數。際此物價日昂之時，市校太少，私校担負不起，祗得任令失學。</p>
<p>廿幾萬學齡靑年及兒童徘徊在敎育門外，千萬個父母的呼聲引起了各方的注意，此間敎育當局似乎也感到問題的嚴重性，但若在本學期增設市中祇是一種幻想，雖然此間也設有靑年輔導處，辦理失學失業靑年登記，輔導復學就業。可是力量有限，問題仍不能根本解決。關於失學兒童的救濟，倒一度傳來好的消息，市敎育局公佈，奉准本學期增設市小廿二所，儘量開設班額，容納大量兒童，原有各校也增班。一般人聆此消息，莫不額手稱慶，可是終因經費，校舍，市敎育局改組等等原因，而只得到「增校決定緩辦」，「增班辦法仍在　訂中」的答覆。</p>
<p>可是韶光易逝，一過去就要等一學期，甚至一年了。任你怎樣呼喊，你所得到的只是一個困難重重而不實際的答覆，想起了教育的前途，誰的心上都蒙上了一層陰影。</p>
<p>倫敦鬧市，交通輻輳。</p>
<h3>英政府心於都市建設工作　頭重脚輕話倫敦</h3>
<p>— 本報十五日航訊　倫敦特約記者雪岩寄</p>
<p>戰爭結束後英國現正忙于建設。第一件事，是建築大倫敦。英是國人口雖祗四千餘萬，但倫敦却就有一千三百餘萬，頗有頭重脚輕之感。戰前就有阿勃克隆培（Sir　Pagrick　Abercrombie）爵士設計建設大倫敦，把倫敦分成四圈，可把許多工廠疏散到市郊去，嗣因戰事發生而中止。現在戰事旣止，此議又起，若干因避轟炸至遷至市郊的工廠，可以不必回來了。據城鄕設計部大臣薛爾根（Silkin）于本月五日在下院宣布，倫敦市參議會已通過撥款二百四十七萬餘鎊，以供建築之用。根據大倫敦的計劃，倫敦共分成四圈，中間是中央國，（Central　Ring），其次市郊圈（Suburban　Ring），再其次深郊圈（Green　Ring），最後全外鄉圈（Outer　Country　Ring）。據說至少有一萬餘萬人可以因此遷居到外郊去。</p>
<p>倫敦市議會於三月八日改選，結果工黨得九十席，保守黨得三十席，自由黨二席，共產黨二席。改選前工黨爲七十六席，保守黨爲四十八席。此次改選結果，保守黨損失十八席，工黨增加十四席，足息工黨之得人心。</p>
<p>邱吉爾演說　大胆人為之咋舌</p>
<p>英國美國同在對蘇聯的態度，疑懼不定時，英國前首相邱吉爾特於二月五日在美國米蘇里大學發表其驚人的演說，使英美人士，恍然了解雙方衝突之深，許多人不免反省難道又要作戰爭的準備了嗎？邱氏演說時所代表的感情，或則是二國人士所共有的，但以他這樣的在政治上的地位與聲望，來說這樣胆火直率的話，述最胆大的人也不免咋舌。所以演講後的反嚮甚大，各方雖有不同。在英國國內，因黨派關係，尤其複雜。邱氏演說發表後的次日，比較左傾的新聞紀事報名記者巴萊特（Vernon-Barlett）就說，據他所知，邱氏在發表演說之前，未商誼政府當局的意見，惟在前曾以演講稿一份送致英國駐美大使哈里法克斯。又次日（即發表演說後的第三日，亦即二月七日）英工黨機關報每日前鋒報又在社論中說，「本報可以很負責說（With　good　autharity）邱氏在演議前未與政府當局商談」。但保守黨的每日郵報却於同日說，邱氏講稿內容，曾由哈里法克斯電吿政府當局，當局與大使館之間，曾對此事交換電報多次。並且說在邱氏起草此稿時，社魯門總統及貝爾納斯，亦有機會閱及，俱表同意。</p>
<p>從這許多電訊中，我們似可看出邱氏的講稿，事先渠個人未徵詢政府當局的意見，因爲他在講前首先聲明，此次演講，僅代表他個人的意見，不帶任何政府的身份，所以嚴格說來，實也無需徵求政府同意，但他有一份講稿，送致英國駐美大使，誰都不否認，而英國駐美大使復電英外部當局，亦屬可能之事。至於美總統杜魯門與邱氏一路同意至米蘇里，事先知其內容，亦近情理。但我們知道，無論英政府當局也好，美政府當局也好，事先知道內容是一件事，表示贊同與否，或則是否具有同樣意見，又是一件事。邱氏旣然聲明祗是他個人的意見，責任全由他個人負，在言論自由國家，誰能干涉他，誰能呌他改變意見。反之在各方面引起反嚮之大，適可以看出他確代表一大部分人士的有力意見。至於兩國政府的態度如何，換言之，站在官方立塲，態度應該如何，以後盡可用其他方式表現，截至今日，兩國政府，似還都不感覺需要發表特別聲明來闡明態度。</p>
<p>英向國借款　十二億五千萬元</p>
<p>英國向加拿大借款十二萬萬五千萬美元，業已成功，其條件與美國貸款相仿，不過其中有一部分須待美國借款成立後方可支用。如果美國的貸款，在美國國會中通不過，則兩國政府再另商動用的步驟。另外，一九四二年英國向加拿大所貸的不付息的款項，延期到一九五一年一月再開始付還，條件如舊，按這筆貸款，總數是七億元，經過同部償還後，現在還剩五億六千萬元。</p>
<p>澳洲政府，與英政府成立協定，歡迎英國人民，移到澳洲去。凡在作戰期間曾在軍隊或商船中服務過的英國人，都可以申請移去，船票可由二政府負担。其他的人，也可申請，一經准許後，成人僅付船票實十鎊，孩童僅付五鎊。但申請願意遷移的人，必須具有在澳久住的次心。據說在作戰期間，英國曾以小孩六千名，移至澳洲避難，但後據政府調査，他們有一大半願意長成後回英。</p>
<p>英帝國會議，將於復活節後在倫敦舉行，澳洲總理，且將不久來英了。會議的主要議題，據說是關於世界貿易問題。蓋英國的帝國優先權及英鎊休團取消後，英帝國間相互的貿易，自然大受影響，需相互商對策。此外，還有糧食問題及帝國防務等問題，大槪也將付諸討論。</p>
<h3>參政會花絮一束</h3>
<p>參政會的新聞記者證，比政治協商會議的講究多了。深綠色硬紙，前面有秘書處的鋼印，背面有參政會的火鈐記，是二十七年第一屆二次大會在漢口印好的，記者的是第七號，與政協會的特七號，不期而同。</p>
<p>從二中全會到國民參政會，一個月，天天跑軍委會，會內的地理，甚至守衛的武裝同志，都非常面熟了。</p>
<p>參政會秘書處人員，在二中全會時間，調至全會工作，現在又接上參政會的工作。參政會一切設備，都是應用二中全會原有的，街上的交通車站牌，休息時間的包子點心，坐在臺前的一位愛着黑色沿紅邊旗袍的速記小姐，都是全會上原有的，所不同者，是塲外增加了一所臨時郵政電報營業處。</p>
<p>莫德惠的花白短髭東北口音，李璜的輕快精幹，王雲五的「科學管理」、江庸的法治精神，吳貽芳的充滿苦樂性的聲音，都是極引起全塲注意的，他們分別主持大會、造成了各種各樣不同的空氣。</p>
<p>每次大會，前一段的報吿節目，多是平平穩　，新聞記者們多聽而不記，因爲第二天中央社要發稿，而且多半都是不久以前的「歷史文件」，宣讓書面詢問的時候，空氣開始緊張，口頭詢問時，全塲　　，如臨大敵。</p>
<p>此「花絮」數則，是在邵力子和張羣作政協會，及停止衝突，整編報吿時寫出，由大會郵局寄發。</p>

<h3>學校租不到校舍　女學生懇切呼籲</h3>
<p>主筆先生：</p>
<p>我們學校（正中女中），在抗戰期間，是幹地下工作是最熱心的一所，因此敵人時常光顧、檢査監視，我們的先生和同學，曾幾次遠捕入獄，受盡刑罰，忠貞不屈直至勝利來臨，勝利後，同學人數增加很多，乃向貼　卡德路十五弄二號之大房東商請租爲校舍，未果。本月初，才知道該號房屋由英婦海徐林登承租，旋經上海市房屋租賃管理委員會成立調解，由該英婦親筆簽字，同意將該幢房屋五間租與敝校爲校舍。那知租金收取，美金須先付六個月，每月租金計美金五十九元；我們學校的經費，一向公開，每學期　借在百萬，歷年借款，尙且沒法歸還，怎樣能擔負此偌大租金。因此學校當局，曾幾次和　情商，要求减低租金，她非但置之不理，並且把我們的敎室，違約出租別人，分隔塲地，妨礙運動；我們數百同學的學棠，勢將中斷，因此全校的先生和同學代表，要求他蹄回敎室，該英婦頑執不化，迄未應允，我們同學徬徨不安，所以懇借貴報一角，給我們登載，請社會的父老先輩們主持公道。（陳琨瑛，三月廿三日。）</p>

<h3>發刋詞</h3>
<p>— 欣之</p>
<p>上海工業品展覽會，經中國技術協會同人籌備四月，規模觕具，終于很欣幸地和諸位親愛的同胞見面了。</p>
<p>雖然展覽會開幕迄今，僅及三日，雖然其內容較諸歐美先進國家各地所開展覽會，遠爲不及，但看了觀衆絡繹於途，讚美的語辭多于貶責，這一種轟動的景象是着實呌人深思猛省的！</p>
<p>本來，在中國近百年的工業史中，民族工業始終串演的配角，八年的抗戰，亦未曾使我們民族工業提高到主導的地位。即使在後方廣大地域中重新建立起來的工業部門尙且因勝利的到來而吿不景氣，更無論在淪陷區裏飽經摧殘的工業了！可是，歷史的輪子是永遠在向前轉動着的，中國是必然要工業化起來的，假使不如此，中國就不能完成建國的大業。</p>
<p>眼看現實，我們技術界的工作人員覺得應該在此地，上海，這個足以代表中國工業的地方，作一個迅速全國工業化的號召。因此，在中國技術協會主持下，舉辦了這第一回的「上海工業品展覽會」。我們沒有什麽奢望，僅想藉這次展覽會的機會，完成我們「展覽工業製品，促進國家建設，普及科學知識，推行技術敎育」的初願。如果，有人能因之而變換他們的目光，將資金投向工業建設或技術敎育方面，那末，「上海工業品展覽會」就完成了它的使命。</p>
<p>在這一次展覽會當中，有很多來賓吿訴我們一方面感覺到中國的工業建設正方興未艾，無論輕工業或者重工業都是落後遠甚；另一方面更覺得中國的工業技術確是很有問題。可是我們技協同人郤認爲只要政治淸明，國力自然會充沛，經濟鞏固，人民的技術水準亦必然會提高起來。</p>
<p>我們技協同人亦誓必本着靑年的期特有朝氣和活力來推進技術的進步！</p>
<p>同時，爲了使上海人士有進一步的認識起見，我們特再假申報一角，作爲上海工業品展覽會特刋，在這小小篇幅裏，我們頤將這一回的上海工業品展覽會和主辦者的中國技術協會，向國人有更進一步的介紹。也希望藉這個機會，能得到國內外的前輩先進，各地的友好，無論識與不識，能來參觀展覽會或者不能，都給予更進一步的同情和指敎！</p>
<h3>中國技術協會今後的努力</h3>
<p>— 王天一</p>
<p>中國技術協會的會員，經過整整四個月的籌備工作，終於把第一屆的上海工業品展覽會，呈獻在全國的人士之前了。由於道次展覽會的成績差可滿意，舉辦的意義更荷關心新中國建設者所了解和接受，人們不由對於辦道個展覽會的中國技術協會有着更深的關懷，在展覽會塲裏面，更有不少的技術人員和職業靑年要求入會。雖然在工展的特刋已有相當的介紹，言詞的贅述亦非我們所崇尙，這裏祗願藉報紙的傳述，向全國的友人作一個總的答覆。</p>
<p>我們的宗旨，根據章程第二條，是：「聯合全國技術人員，致力國家建設，普及技術敎育，促進學術研究，謀求共同福利。」這裏可以說明的，已經加入技協爲會員的共總有化工·電工·機械·土木·紡織·農業·商業·礦冶·數理各部門的技術人員四百餘人，在道次展覽會裏申請加入的又有玩不百人。此外在籌備期間，已經得到重慶，昆明各地技術人員的響應和參加，而在上海入會的會員有好多已因職務的調動，到台灣和沿海各埠去工作。預料在不久的將來，上述各地的技協分會，即可組成。我們很希望其他各地的同情技協工作的朋友們，來取得聯絡，逐漸地成立分會，建立一個堅强結實的全國性的技術人員團體。</p>
<p>關於致力國家建設，我們相信這是每一個技術人員的志願，也是他的理想。中國技術人員而不能對於新中國的建設，盡一分力量，是他個人的恥辱，也是國家的損失。所以技協約會員們無不渴切地期盼一個龐大而切實的全國性經濟建設計劃早日開始，我們會員因此各各獲有「以技能貢獻國家」的機會，而國力的日漸虛耗，人民生計的不能再忍受下去，實是主要理由。</p>
<p>普及技術敎育，是技協和他的前身「工餘聯誼社」一直在努力着的方向，因爲這正是技術人員不論在何時何地，站在自己的崗位上，都可以努力的工作。鑒於建國體制的鉅大，技術幹部的短少，我們過去這樣努力，將來亦復如此。工程界雜誌將不願紙價和印工的昂貴而繼續出版下去。第三屆工業講座是技協四月份預定的行事。中國技術專科夜校，已因這次展覽會得到社會的鼓勵，更計劃充實內容和擴大規模之外，「技協」還想出一二套。大衆性的技術叢書，如有出版界願意合作的話。</p>
<p>說到學術硏究，這是技協會員比較上覺得慚愧的地方。除了一部分會負，個人的造詣和努力不算以外，大體而論，技協會員現在是服務的工作過於偏重，本身的進修不免忽略。這是要克服的，今後除了爲社會而辦的講座和刋物以外，也要辦爲自己學術演講會和圖書館。更準備和各國的學術機關團體取得聯絡，交換刋物，收集資料。</p>
<p>對於技協約希望，許多會負都提到福利工作。在今天，工業停滯，物價高昂的此刻技術人員待遇普遍低落，實有着種種的因素，我們不能因此便不爲自己的生活與地位作一點打算。計畫中的有職業介紹和消費合作兩項，這些，我們尤其希望工商界的合作和協助。</p>
<p>如果新中國的建設得以順利完成，一定是全國各階層精誠合作和堅持努力有以俱成。技協同人在艱難的時期中刻苦努力了兩年多，這努力已經事實證明不曾浪費，今後的工作相信也一定可以獲致應得的効果。</p>
<p>在成立會上，代表工程界的趙祖康先生趙曾珏先生，代表科學界的曹梁厦先生何尙平先生，都對認爲中國技術協會將和中國科學社與中國工程師學會成爲建國的三鼎足，這實是過譽。全國工業協會的胡厥文先生胡西園先生尤其希望技協約會員與工業界保持密切的聯繫，這也是盛意。我們再不當得起，不過我們極想這樣做，我們尤其尊重前輩的學者的先進團體以及進步的民族工業家的成就，希望在他們的指導和贊助下，我們能日新月異地發揮技術人員的力量，實現技術人員的理想。</p>
<p>上海工業品展覽會的開幕，使技協會無疑地又邁進了一步。我們堅決相信，我們旣然有目標，肯努力，我們的團體必然可以一天一天邁進，我們的工作，也必然可以獲得全國人士的同情和支援。到達一個富强康樂的新中國，這行程是幷不遙遠的。</p>
<h3>評語潮湧</h3>
<p>「技術敎育是今後建國的要務，中國技術協會，打着這旗幟前進，不應以過去的成績自滿，還該埋頭苦幹」</p>
<p>「辦事人員的確熱心，而且很多，要是能在指導設明上多化些精力，參觀的人收獲一定要更多！」</p>
<p>「許多小工業的確比八年前進步，可以說戰爭一方面雖然毁壞了若干工業，但一方面也建立了若干工業，此較地說來，工業是抬了點頭的，可是這抬了點頭的工業，在以後還是繼續地發展下去，以達到工業建國的目的呢？還是在萎縮下來變曇花一現呢？這是很重要的問題，也正是工業界目前最憂慮的問題」</p>
<p>「戰後中國必須工業化，現在參觀展覽過後，已覺國人在努力改進，欣慰無量。」</p>
<p>「我們需要這樣的工業品展覽以灌輸一般市民，尤其是兒童以工業知識。」</p>
<p>「希望道次中國技術協會主辦以上海工業品展覽會，不僅僅給與參加此會的各廠們一個推廣營業，彼此對於出品研究觀摩以機會，同時也給與各廠商一個互相聯絡，團結組織的機會，使得中國的民族工業家能因此而組織起來，走上眞正推進中國工業化運動的道路。」</p>
<p>「無疑地，在戰後工業凋蔽的中國，工業品展覽會確予人們以一種新的啓示。」</p>

<h3>Gillin and Zhou Discussed in Chongqing, Northeast Conflict Resolved to be Stopped, Executive Headquarters to Send Task Force</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] Lieutenant General Gillin, the acting replacement for General Marshall, held late-night talks yesterday with Zhou Enlai and Zhang Zhizhong. He further conferred with Zhou and Chairman Chiang today regarding the urgent need to dispatch an executive task force to the Northeast to prevent the outbreak of a large-scale civil war. It is expected that the official announcement will be delayed until tomorrow. It is understood that General Gillin, along with Zhang and Zhou, may personally fly to the Northeast within this week to supervise the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. Some sources predict that if the war in the Northeast cannot be stopped, it may trigger even greater conflicts in other parts of China, rendering General Marshall's efforts completely futile. If Zhang Zhizhong does indeed fly to the Northeast, his trip to Xinjiang will be postponed. It is reported that Lieutenant General Gillin strongly emphasized that the situation in the Northeast is currently very tense.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 26th] Zhou Enlai returned to Chongqing yesterday from Yan'an and immediately continued discussions with the government. It is widely rumored in the wartime capital that Marshal Marshall will return to China from the United States around April 15th.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 26th] Well-informed sources say that the Executive Headquarters will indeed dispatch an executive task force to the Northeast to mediate military conflicts. The task force may consist of five to seven groups. Specific locations have not yet been determined, and detailed measures are still being formulated by the Executive Headquarters. This information has not yet been confirmed by those responsible at the Executive Headquarters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated: Regarding the Communist Party's recent proposal to extend the ceasefire order to the Northeast and to send an executive task force, the government, out of consideration for the people of the Northeast and to restore local order as soon as possible, has agreed in principle. However, this cannot conflict with the provision in the ceasefire order jointly issued on January 10th that National Army troops are not subject to any restrictions when moving to the Northeast. Furthermore, the Communist Party's troops must not use this as an excuse to obstruct the National Army from taking over areas evacuated by the Soviet Army or to attack areas already recovered by the National Army. All Chinese people desire national unity and complete sovereignty. The disruptive activities of the Communist Army in various parts of the Northeast violate the people's wishes. The Communist Party's Xinhua Daily News has falsely claimed on the 19th and 26th of this month that "the National Army in Shenyang is expanding the civil war by attacking the Democratic Allied Forces," which is a distortion of the facts and confusing to the public.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Continue to Withdraw, Personnel of Liaobei Provincial Government Arrived in Changchun Last Night</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Changchun, 25th] The widespread rumor that Soviet troops would suddenly withdraw from Changchun on the 26th has been proven false by the facts as of today. The Soviet troops appearing in the city in recent days are more refined than previously seen, and beautiful blue-eyed, blonde female soldiers with red lips and powdered faces are often seen strolling the streets, in shopping areas and entertainment venues. Based on various indications, there is no sign of a complete departure in the next few days. The troop withdrawal has continued in recent days. When leaving Changchun, most now depart from Kuanchengzi Station (north of Changchun Station), no longer from Changchun Station, which they frequented in the past. It is said that after boarding the train and leaving Changchun, they mostly travel east, passing through Jilin and Yanji to Vladivostok. People here generally hope that the Soviet troops will withdraw as soon as possible. Some people are anxiously wondering if the National Army will arrive in Changchun soon, but when this is asked of our officials, there is no definite answer.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 26th] The situation in Changchun is developing delicately. Soviet troops continue to withdraw, but in small numbers. Yesterday afternoon, when the Soviet troops in a certain printing factory in Erdahezi finally withdrew, someone witnessed eleven trucks filled with Chinese laborers wearing mixed-color military uniforms being driven away, each truck with two armed Soviet soldiers, along the Jichang Highway. It would be more accurate to call these laborers "troops." At the same time, many armed men of unknown origin are being transported into the city by various means. Yesterday, a sentry from the Second Security Regiment discovered three heavy machine guns hidden in a two-wheeled cart loaded with grass. In addition, there was a coffin transporting weapons and ammunition into the city. According to sources in the transportation sector, three military trains departed from north of Kuanchengzi Station last night, carrying more than twenty Soviet tanks.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The personnel of the Liaobei Provincial Government left Siping by special train last night, but were stopped at the Gongzhuling Station. The railway authorities dispatched another special train to pick them up on the 26th, and they arrived in Changchun that night.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] Officials here announced today that Soviet troops are now beginning a large-scale withdrawal from the Northeast. This news was revealed by Vice Foreign Minister Liu Kai in response to inquiries. A large detachment of Soviet troops, accompanied by tanks and artillery, is indeed advancing along the Jichang Highway from Shenyang to Changchun, heading towards Vladivostok, but detailed information is not available. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's announcement that the Soviet troops will complete their withdrawal before April and that a large-scale troop movement has already begun has greatly eased the international tensions caused by the Northeast. However, problems such as the dismantling of machinery and equipment in many mining areas and industries by the Soviet side remain to be resolved.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 26th] Dong Yanping, the chief of our military delegation in Changchun, held the seventeenth meeting with Soviet Chief of Staff Tiyuzenko at 3:00 PM on the 26th. It lasted one hour, the shortest of all meetings. Afterwards, Dong declined to comment.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 26th] Reports say that the New First Army has arrived at Siping Street, but people in Beiping believe this is premature. Most of the National Army started on foot from Shenyang, and the distance between the two places is 105 miles, requiring at least five days of forced march to reach.</p>
<h3>New Sino-American Commercial Treaty Negotiations Have Begun</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] It is learned that, according to the provisions of the new Sino-American Treaty, the United States and China should discuss a commercial treaty within six months after the end of the war against the common enemy. The U.S. government sent a draft of the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation to our country last spring. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, within its purview, conducted detailed discussions on the draft treaty regarding the restrictions on the acquisition and management rights of foreign property and the rights to enjoy free trade. Countermeasures were formulated, and negotiations with the U.S. side have begun to reach a compromise.</p>
<h3>Personnel of the Northwest Headquarters Are Gradually Going to Lanzhou</h3>
<p>Director Zhang Zhizhong Will First Go to Xinjiang</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] The Northwest Headquarters will be established in Lanzhou in the near future, and key internal personnel have been gradually going there to prepare. Zhang Zhizhong, the Director of the Headquarters, will fly to Xinjiang as soon as the Military Three-Person Team reaches a final agreement to continue discussing unresolved matters with the Yining People's Representatives, and then return to Lanzhou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 25th] Three representatives from Yining arrived in Dihua by plane on the morning of the 25th to continue discussing the resolution of the local incident in Xinjiang. In addition, the newly appointed Xinjiang Supervisory Commissioner, Masud, arrived in Dihua by plane this morning.</p>
<h3>Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group Scheduled to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss Finance</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] After a three-hour meeting, the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group unanimously passed only one item regarding the wording of the issues discussed: the Kuomintang can only elect Kuomintang members to the National Government Committee, and cannot elect members of other parties. The group is scheduled to meet again on the 28th to reach a final agreement on the organization and establishment of the National Assembly and to ensure that all parties support the organization of the Political Consultative Conference. The group will also seek to reconcile the discrepancies between the Political Consultative Conference and the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee regarding military issues.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Living Expense Standards for Public Servants and Educators</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] At its regular meeting this morning, the Executive Yuan passed a resolution to adjust the standard for the payment of living allowances for central civilian public servants and educators. This measure will be implemented from March of this year, calculated as follows: Level 1, basic salary of 70,000 yuan, multiplied by 160 (Dihua, Guihua, Baotou, Kangding); Level 2, 50,000 yuan, multiplied by 160 (Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Hengyang, Changsha, Kunming, Guangzhou, Xinjiang); Level 3, 45,000 yuan, multiplied by 150 (Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Guilin, Qingdao, Kaifeng, Lanzhou); Level 4, 45,000 yuan, multiplied by 140 (Jiangsu, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Gansu, Xikang, Zhejiang, Fujian, Suiyuan, Yunnan, Henan, Hunan); Level 5, 35,000 yuan, multiplied by 130 (Sichuan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Anhui, Ningxia, Qinghai, Chahar). Furthermore: (1) Police chiefs will receive 70% of the basic amount, police officers will continue to receive 60% of the food allowance, and laborers will receive 50%. (2) Shanghai police chiefs will receive 90% of the basic amount, and police officers and laborers will receive 80%. (3) There are already improved treatment principles for civilian officials, and the figures will be formulated separately. (4) The cost of food and non-staple food for officials and students of provincial schools and military academies at all levels will be adjusted separately. (5) Chongqing's allowance is more than 58% higher than in January, and all regions have increased by more than 100%.</p>
<h3>Yang Jie Discusses the International Situation: No War Likely to Occur in the Next Ten Years</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Kunming, 25th] Military theorist General Yang Jie discussed the current international situation and future world wars at a tea party in Kunming hosted by the Kunming branch of the Beiping Research Institute and seven other organizations to welcome Li Shizeng. He criticized the claim that a third world war is about to break out, stating: There are three issues among the great powers: (1) "Gain," (2) "Security," and (3) "Ability." First, they want to gain other people's things. After gaining them, they want to ensure security. To ensure security, they must have the ability. The atomic bomb is the ability of Britain and the United States to ensure security. Due to the competition for ability, international wars seem inevitable. However, given the current situation of various countries, a third world war will not break out in the next ten years. China should strive for peaceful national reconstruction in the next ten years and catch up so that it can cope with the new situation ten years later.</p>
<h3>Senior Government Officials Returning to the Capital, Air Transport to Begin in Mid-April, Chairman Chiang to Return to Nanjing Before the National Assembly Opens</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] In order to alleviate the difficulties of governance and relieve the suffering of the people in the recovered areas, the government can no longer spend Dragon Boat Festival in Chongqing. The transportation arrangements for returning to the capital have been decided. Starting in mid-April, 20 airplanes will be used to transport senior officials from various government departments to Nanjing. After April 20th, the number may be increased to 50. The government has formulated a plan to ensure that senior officials begin work as soon as they arrive in Nanjing. Staff members below the rank of section chief can leisurely enjoy the scenery of the Three Gorges and slowly come to Nanjing by air.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 26th] Sources in the wartime capital say that Chairman Chiang will go to the capital on April 20th and stay there until the National Assembly closes. It is not yet certain whether he will then travel to the United States or visit Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Based on appearances, Chairman Chiang has planned a trip abroad and will be accompanied by his wife.</p>
<h3>North China Begins Mass Repatriation of Japanese Prisoners of War Today</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 26th] Deputy Chief of Staff Wu of the Eleventh War Area stated that the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war was previously hindered by a lack of ships and slow transportation. Recently, a solution has been negotiated, and starting from the 27th, 4,500 prisoners of war and Japanese nationals can board ships at Tanggu Port to return to their country. Currently, the Eleventh War Area has over 90,000 Japanese prisoners of war and over 100,000 Japanese nationals awaiting repatriation, totaling over 180,000 people including the prisoners of war and nationals from Shanxi.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Post Office Brewing Strike</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] Regarding the postal strike, although it has not yet materialized, it has gradually become apparent in recent days. If the authorities still do not adjust this month's compensation, it is rumored that they will stage a general strike on the 28th and petition the authorities.</p>
<h3>Corruption Supervisor Ban Gan Executed by Firing Squad in Lanzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 26th] The corruption case of Ban Gan, the director of the Eighth War Area Logistics Station, was thoroughly investigated by the military court and found to be well-founded. He was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on the morning of the 26th.</p>
<h3>Seven Groups Supervise Road Repair, Restoration of Transportation is Optimistic, Railways Will be Unobstructed Within 45 Days</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 26th] The Executive Headquarters will soon issue an optimistic statement on the restoration of transportation. According to the Railway Administration Department, North China can prioritize the repair of railways. 20% of its work has already been completed. If the situation is good, all railway lines in the North China and Central China regions will be unobstructed in 45 days. It is learned that there are currently seven groups working in Botou, Anyang, Nankou, Gaomi, Zaozhuang, Xuzhou, and Yancheng, responsible for supervising the prioritized repairs of various lines. The restoration of each line is quite optimistic. Taking Xuzhou as an example, the Longhai Railway is already open to traffic to Haizhou. The Jinpu Railway north of Xuzhou will be able to reach Lincheng in a few days. Trains traveling south from Tianjin can also reach Botou. In recent weeks, railway lines have been able to connect to new areas. In addition to the above-mentioned lines being prioritized for repair, other sections that have suffered minor damage will also be connected to restore transportation. In addition, the restoration of highways is also underway. The Ministry of Communications has sent a highway inspection team to Chengde, Shanhaiguan, Kaifeng, Shijiazhuang, Jinan, Qingdao, and other places for inspection. The Executive Headquarters has issued them travel permits. Sources in the Military Mediation Department stated that the manpower and material resources for the restoration of transportation work cannot be their responsibility. Furthermore, regarding the personnel issues of railways in the Communist-controlled areas, the Ministry of Communications may resolve them through methods such as screening and commissioning.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The road restoration project on the Xuhai section of the eastern part of the Longhai Railway is half completed. If there are no unexpected obstacles, it will be open to traffic at the beginning of next month. The Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway will be difficult to repair in the short term. Refugees are currently using oxcarts as transportation, and it takes ten days to travel from Ji'ning to Xuzhou.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Ji'nan, 26th] According to sources from the Railway Bureau, the road surface on the highway between Ji'nan and Xuzhou is still passable, and there are plans to send vehicles for trial runs in the near future.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Implementing Government Orders in Shandong Province, Communist Army Destroys Postal Service</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Ji'nan, 26th] Liu Daoyuan, the director of the Shandong Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, stated that before the victory, government orders in Shandong Province extended to over 80 counties and 14 special commissioner districts. After the victory, the Communist Army expanded its territory and gradually occupied it. Currently, the government only controls seven cities, six locations, and one municipality. Cadres are clustered in the uncaptured cities, approximately 5,000 people. There are over 14 million unemployed refugees, and the trend of increase continues. According to reporter's inquiry: There are currently more than 50 exiled county governments in Ji'nan, similar to the exiled governments of various countries in Britain during the war. However, their current work is to preserve archives and prepare for the stabilization of the situation before returning to their posts to carry out their duties.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Ji'nan, 26th] According to those in charge of the postal service here, the postal business in Shandong Province is extremely difficult due to the Communist Army's interference. Before the war, there were over 140 post offices in Shandong Province, but now only 30 or so can maintain contact with the Postal Administration. After the victory, the average total monthly income of post offices throughout the province was only a few million yuan, and after offsetting expenses, the monthly loss was 70 million yuan. In areas controlled by the Communist Army, they forcibly use postal stamps issued by the Communist Army, expel excellent employees, and appoint employees who have been dismissed for embezzlement and malfeasance, disrupting the postal service more than the enemy puppets. Recently, postal employees in various places, unable to withstand the oppression of the Communist Army, have fled to Qingdao and Ji'nan in increasing numbers. They believe that the Communist Army's actions to seize power by any means are unwise.</p>
<h3>Reporting Procedures of the Councilors' Assembly Concluded, Review Committee to be Held Starting Today, Yesterday's General Assembly Reported on Internal Affairs and Disaster Relief</h3>

The reporting procedures of the General Assembly ended today, and the Review Committee will be held starting on the 27th. At the meeting on the 26th, chaired by Jiang Yong, Minister of Interior Zhang Lisheng attended and gave a report on internal affairs.

After a ten-minute break, Pu Xiefeng, the Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, gave a report on disaster relief work. He reported on the handling of disaster relief work in great detail. As soon as the report was completed, it was time to adjourn the meeting. The chairman then announced that three oral inquiries regarding the disaster relief report should be submitted in writing by the original proposers, along with another 25 written inquiries, and all submitted to the Review Committee.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] There were a total of 42 written inquiries on the report on grain administration at the Councilors' Assembly.</p>
<h3>Use Refugees and Prisoners to Reclaim Wasteland in Kunming</h3>
<p>Yunnan Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute Suggests to the Provincial Government</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Kunming, 25th] The Yunnan Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Improvement Institute recently requested the provincial government to use homeless refugees and prisoners of war to reclaim the wasteland between Kunming and Songming.

<p>Jinan Electric: The American Consulate will reopen soon. The United States has dispatched Hessin from the United States to Ji'nan and is expected to arrive next month.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Military Progressing Smoothly, Returning "Difficult Soldiers" to the Field is the Current Difficulty</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Military News: The work of reorganizing the military south of the Yellow River is largely complete. The reorganization of troops stationed in Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces north of the Yellow River and in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces in the Northwest began in early this month and is proceeding very smoothly because officers and soldiers of all units are able to understand the greater righteousness and appreciate the overall situation. Remaining officers in various places have been provided with the convenience of schooling or career changes in accordance with the planned plan. However, the most difficult problem at present is that of the remaining soldiers in various units who are from Hunan or who are from rural households in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces. Today, their hometowns have mostly suffered from the ravages of war and banditry, and there is a serious famine. According to reliable estimates, at least 50% of the farm families in some units are "difficult soldiers" who "have armor to disarm but no fields to return to." Although the Chinese countryside currently needs manpower, the current food situation and rural order in various places are extremely worrying. The best way to settle these "difficult soldiers" is either "farming" or "working as laborers," but it requires the early restoration of transportation. In the past month, the final drafts of the Military Affairs Commission's clear orders urging the restoration of road traffic on all lines have been filling boxes.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 26th] The nationwide reorganization of the military will include North China in the ninth phase, that is, from July to September. Deputy Chief of Staff Wu of the Eleventh War Area stated that the reorganization of the military is the demobilization work. The war zone will not be cancelled until this work is completed. Currently, the jurisdiction of the Eleventh War Area is Hebei and Chahar, and as for Shandong, it has been transferred to the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Indictment of Traitor Chen Bijun</h3>
<p>— Our Suzhou Correspondent Qingping</p>
<p>Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Indictment Qi Zi No. 396</p>
<p>Defendant: Chen Bijun, female, age 56, native of Xinhui County, Guangdong, residing at No. 30 Fazheng Road, Guangzhou, former Executive Committee Member of the Puppet Central Palace Department.</p>
<p>Regarding the above-mentioned defendant, case No. 532 Zhen Zi of the 35th year of the Republic of China, regarding the matter of being a traitor, the investigation has been concluded, and it is deemed that a public prosecution should be initiated. Now, the defendant's criminal facts and evidence, as well as the legal articles violated, are listed as follows:</p>
<p>The defendant, Chen Bijun, is the wife of the deceased traitor Wang Zhaoming. She once served as a member of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, she accompanied the traitor Wang to Chongqing. In the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the traitor Wang colluded with the Japanese chieftain Konoe, and secretly made peace. The defendant participated in the conspiracy. In December of that year, the defendant and the traitor Wang secretly left Chongqing, first to Hanoi, and sent the traitor Chen Gongbo to Hong Kong, where he issued a sensational telegram, responding to Konoe's proposed Three Principles of Peace. Subsequently, the defendant and the traitor Wang went from Hanoi to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai. In March of the 29th year, they organized a puppet government in Nanjing, openly resisting the central government. At that time, the traitor Wang served as Chairman, and the defendant served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Puppet Central Party Department and a member of the Puppet Central Political Committee. Throughout the traitor Wang's life, the defendant invariably assisted in all the puppet government's schemes to betray the central government and ingratiate itself with the enemy. Observing that they used "Ming" (referring to Wang Zhaoming) and "Ya" (referring to the defendant) as code words in secret telegrams for communication with various parties, it is very clear that she and the traitor Wang jointly ruled and grasped real power, with immense influence. Even after the traitor Wang died and the traitor Chen Gongbo succeeded him as puppet chairman, the defendant, as a widow, still traveled to Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Wuhan, and other places, falsely advocating a "comprehensive peace" in order to deceive the public and ingratiate herself with the enemy. She also secretly established special agent organizations, cruelly harming underground comrades, causing our ancient country with thousands of years of culture to fall to the Japanese invaders, without shame, seeking personal gain by selling out the country, and failing to wake up until death. Her crimes of colluding with enemy countries and resisting her own country are truly unforgivable. Now, examining the most prominent of her treasonous acts during her tenure in the puppet government, they are described separately below:</p>
<p>(A) Guangzhou is an important town in South China, and Hong Kong and Macau are our country's gateways. Since our government moved west to Chongqing, the transportation of materials from friendly countries and the supply of armaments have almost entirely relied on this route. The defendant, seeing this, decided to reside in Nanjing for two months and in Guangdong for two months. All major military and political affairs of the puppet Guangdong Provincial Government were decided by the defendant. Observing the various telegrams from the puppet Guangdong Provincial Governor Chen Yaozu to the defendant ("Ya") regarding the important military and political affairs of Guangdong Province, the facts are obvious. Her intention was nothing more than to cut off the source of supplies for our government, weaken our resistance, and assist the enemy's aggression. Her intentions are reprehensible, and her actions are particularly heinous.</p>
<p>(B) Upon investigation, when the puppet Guangdong Provincial Governor Chen Chunpu resigned and left Guangdong, the defendant returned to Guangdong with all speed and took charge of the government for four months. On one hand, she requested that the traitor Chu Minyi be appointed Governor of Guangdong (see the interrogation record of the Military Affairs Commission's Investigation Office and the defendant, as well as the investigation record of this court). It can be said that she spared no effort in seizing political power. Other matters, such as incorporating the bandit leader Zhang Yizhou, reorganizing the former Fourth Route Army of Li Fuqun, transferring their positions, and dispatching Wang Yingru to Thailand to handle liaison with the Japanese army stationed in Thailand, as well as the appointment of Xu Shaorong as the puppet Guangdong Provincial Committee Member and concurrently Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and He Liwen as acting puppet Mayor of Shantou, all had to be reported to the defendant and Wang Zhaoming for approval. It can be generally seen that she and Wang Zhaoming were accomplices in evil (see Chen Yaozu's telegrams to "Ya" and to "Ming Ya," etc.).</p>
<p>(C) Upon investigation, the various intelligence reports from Liao Gongshao and Chen Gengting, and Jian Shu of the Special Affairs Committee Special Agent Headquarters South China Regional Headquarters of the Puppet Central Executive Committee, were all separately reported to the defendant for review and approval. It can be concluded that the defendant alone was in charge of intelligence work in South China. For example, in Liao Gongshao's report, it stated that the gateway to the war zone, Hong Kong and Macau, should be controlled to curb Yu Jiang's activities in Hong Kong and develop the forces of peace. Chen Gengting's report stated that seeking peace through struggle is like a surging tide. Furthermore, overseas Chinese deposits, which used to go to the Chongqing government, now support the banner of peace. Jian Shu's report included various absurd statements about being ordered to summon comrades of the peace movement to be responsible for special agent work. The defendant cannot shirk her responsibility with empty words such as never reading special agent reports.</p>
<p>(D) Upon investigation, the appointment of Gao Hanzong, of the Puppet 20th Division as Chief of Staff, and the transfer of Wang Qi as puppet Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Guo Weimin as puppet Chief of the Police Department, and Zhou Yingxiang concurrently as puppet Mayor of Guangzhou, all had to be approved by the Japanese liaison officer Yazaki and the military commander Sakai, etc. Other administrative matters such as planning for grain distribution based on population, general food rationing, transportation, economics, and education also had to be approved by Yazaki and Sakai (as evidenced by Chen Yaozu's telegrams to "Ya"). In everything from personnel appointments to administration, they followed the enemy's orders. This observation further demonstrates their collusion with enemy countries and resistance to their own country.</p>
<p>In summary, the defendant has committed the crime stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 220, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is initiated, and a corresponding request is made for a trial according to the law. Prosecutor Wei Qing, Clerk Wang Buyun, March 27, 35th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>First Act of the United Nations Security Council Meeting: Intense Debate Between the United States and the Soviet Union; Soviet Union Requests That the Iranian Issue Not Be Discussed; Representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States Unanimously Oppose</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco 26th Broadcast: The second session of the Security Council, to which the fate of the world is closely tied, began its first act at 4:07 PM today (Greenwich Mean Time, i.e., 0:07 AM on the 27th Shanghai time). Byrnes attended, sitting next to U.S. Representative Stettinius. Byrnes originally had no seat, and a seat was added to the venue at the last minute. After the meeting began, Soviet Representative Gromyko delivered a speech opposing placing Iran on the agenda. It is claimed that in the rumors in San Francisco and at the first session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet representative had clarified the Soviet position. In those statements, the Soviet Union had stated the importance of the United Nations in maintaining world security and peace. There has been no change in the Soviet position at present. Marshal Stalin has confirmed this in his talks with reporters. The Soviet Union is equal to all countries and opposes any country ruling other countries. At this point, Gromyko suggested that the General Assembly not place the Iranian issue on the agenda and announced that on March 24, Soviet troops continued to withdraw from Iran. Unless there is an "unexpected event," the withdrawal of Soviet troops can be completed within five or six weeks.</p>
<p>Byrnes then rose to oppose the Soviet representative's suggestion, strongly advocating that the Iranian issue be added to the agenda. It is said that Iran has submitted the issue to the Security Council, pointing out that the Soviet Union's actions have threatened world security and peace. The Iranian Ambassador to the United States sent a letter to the U.S. government on March 18, stating that Soviet troops continued to be stationed in Iran after March 2 and interfered in Iran's internal affairs. Although the Soviet Union has now claimed to have reached an agreement with Iran, since the Soviet Union and Iran have not jointly submitted a statement to the Security Council, we should not refuse to listen to the debate on the Iranian issue.</p>
<p>At this point, British Representative Cadogan also rose to speak, stating that the United Kingdom fully agrees with Byrnes's proposal.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] London 26th Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin has telegraphed instructions to British Representative Cadogan attending the Security Council, proposing five inquiries to Soviet Representative Gromyko in rumors: explain the truth about the withdrawal from Iran; the negotiation process before the withdrawal; the conditions accepted by the Iranian Prime Minister; the reasons why Soviet troops failed to withdraw before March 2 according to the 1942 agreement; explain the true meaning of the Soviet statement "unless there is an unexpected event." It is reported that the U.S. representative will also raise similar questions.</p>
<p>Also, news: Since Sunday last week, Soviet troops have been withdrawing from northern Iran, led by forty tanks. More than fifteen hundred Soviet troops' trucks have withdrawn from Geran.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Eleven Countries Gathered Together; Guo Taiqi Delivered the Opening Speech</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse New York 25th Dispatch] The United Nations Security Council opened at the Tillet Academy at 7:30 PM today. Representatives of eleven countries sat around a horseshoe-shaped long table. Present were French Representative Parodi, U.S. Representative Stettinius, British Representative Cadogan, Soviet Representative Gromyko, Chinese Representative Guo Taiqi, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, New York Governor Dewey, and New York Mayor O'Dwyer, who also attended the meeting and delivered speeches in the afternoon. Finally, Chairman Guo Taiqi gave a thank-you speech in English and then opened the meeting, which will continue tomorrow at 4:00 PM (midnight on the 27th Shanghai time).</p>
<p>Before his speech, Guo first read a welcome speech from the Chairman of the Bronx City Council, hoping that the United Nations organization would choose the city as its permanent site. Guo then immediately delivered a reply, expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome from Lan. He also stated: President Truman's welcome speech can be regarded as the feelings of the American people. The Security Council is determined to maintain the organization as a united and indivisible body, and its mission is significant, to say the least. At present, the whole world hopes to see human rights and dignity guaranteed. After the world suffered an unprecedented catastrophe, all mankind wishes to establish a sound and permanent foundation for peace. The Security Council is responsible for this major mission, which is to maintain world peace and security and eliminate differences between countries of all sizes in order to cope with complex and difficult problems. Therefore, this path is not easy, but I hope that the Security Council can overcome all difficulties and succeed in fulfilling the expectations of the people of all countries.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Delivers a Speech: Must Abide by the United Nations Charter to Achieve Peace</h3>
<p>(United States Information Service New York 26th Dispatch) When the Security Council held a meeting yesterday, U.S. Byrnes personally delivered a welcome speech and read President Truman's welcome speech.</p>
<p>Truman's Welcome Speech</p>
<p>"On behalf of the American people, I extend a welcome to the representatives of the Security Council member states, the heads of the United Nations agencies, and their colleagues for their visit to our country. The United Nations organization chose our country as its meeting place, and we are deeply honored. We will do our best to make your stay comfortable and pleasant. But if the United Nations cannot uphold the spirit of wartime unity and cooperation to fight for peace and freedom, then there is no comfortable place for the United Nations organization to be in. The American people especially wish you every success and, moreover, assure you that we will be able to cooperate sincerely to strengthen the strength and will of the United Nations organization so that it can maintain peace and freedom in this interdependent world."</p>
<p>Byrnes's Welcome Speech</p>
<p>This is truly a moment of utmost importance in world history. After the Security Council convenes this meeting, it will regularly carry out its tasks in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, it is very important for all member states of the Council to send representatives to reside at the location of this organization at any time, because the task of the Council is to protect world peace at all times. I (Byrnes referring to himself) am confident that upholding the Charter is the firm determination of the American people, and the United Nations people who are united to protect peace and law must also have the same determination. The Charter has not made ancient privileges sacred and inviolable, and at the same time, in a rapidly changing world, the Charter has not made any changes unconstitutional. The Charter stipulates that countries of all sizes should avoid resorting to force or threatening with force, except for those who defend public law. In resolving disputes, countries should strive to avoid resorting to war as individuals do, but no country has the right to do whatever it wants. If disputes cannot be resolved through friendly negotiations, they should be submitted to the Security Council, which is why the Security Council must continue to be active. If we want the United Nations to last, then no country should do whatever it wants under any pretext or need. The utmost responsibility for maintaining peace and security has fallen on the Security Council. The Council must deal with some problems, and these problems are the factors that countries previously prepared to fight over. It is the duty of all members of the United Nations to cooperate with the Security Council to complete its mission. All countries must discuss their grievances in the Security Council in a free and frank manner. No issue related to world peace should become an untouchable issue of honor. Issues of honor between individuals are no longer resolved through duels, so issues of honor between countries should not be resolved on the battlefield either. We must live in accordance with the Charter. This is the path to peace, and the path to peace is what people all over the world want to follow. We are gathered here to fulfill our responsibilities to the people, and we must not let them down.</p>

<p>[Associated Press New York 25th Dispatch] New York Governor Dewey today delivered a welcome speech to the representatives of the Security Council of the Painting Organization, saying: You have the responsibility to resolve the disputes of all nations suffering in the world, and you must treat the strong and the weak equally and resolve them with fairness and justice.

Minister Yu said that if Sunan and Wuxi and other places have no private banks and are prosperous industrial and commercial areas, there is indeed a need to open up, and he will wait until the banking law is revised to handle it; (3) That the income tax and profit tax for November and December of the 34th year are exempt.

<h3>一位聰明美麗的意大利女郎　女間諜貝安卡　她說：她的美色，引起了許多緾繞；許多人因爲愛不到她而對她憎恨。</h3>
<p>A Smart and Beautiful Italian Girl: Female Spy Bianca; She Says: Her Beauty Has Caused Many Entanglements; Many People Hate Her Because They Cannot Obtain Her Love.</p>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in Guangzhou, Liang Feng</p>
<p>"Bianca has been arrested, this beautiful female spy."</p>
<p>"Is Bianca really a female spy?"</p>
<p>"Is Bianca more beautiful and more powerful than Kawashima Yoshiko?"</p>
<p>"Bianca..."</p>
<p>This news, like a novel, is not only published in the newspapers in Guangzhou, but Bianca's name is also mentioned in every teahouse, tavern, and street corner in Guangzhou, becoming their best conversation material.</p>
<p>On November 12th of last year, a plane from Shanghai to Guangzhou carried an Italian girl who claimed to be the number one patient in the West. This girl came from an Italian noble family. Her father was an Italian rear admiral, and her uncle was the commander of the Imperial Guard. Her beauty has turned many different kinds of men upside down. It is said that a Japanese man once used her story to write a very touching novel, which was later translated into English and became very popular in Europe. The title of this novel is "An Italian Girl's Sweet Dream."</p>
<p>Now, the protagonist of this novel is also the protagonist of this novel-like female spy case. Her name is Bianca Sannion.</p>
<p>How was Bianca discovered? From the interrogation of enemy spies arrested in Shanghai by our government, her name and crimes were provided by the enemy spies. Our government immediately communicated and strictly apprehended her. The Guangzhou headquarters indeed detected her whereabouts and secretly monitored her. As a female spy, Bianca is naturally the most sensitive. Seeing that the situation in Guangzhou was not good, she secretly tried to escape to Shanghai by plane in December of last year. Who knew that before the plane took off, she was arrested by our authorities at the airport. It has been four months since then. She was secretly audited by the headquarters once, but the outside world knew nothing about it. Recently, because of her mental disorder and loss of normalcy, she requested to go out for treatment. At 5:00 PM on March 5th, she was sent to Boji Hospital on Changdi. By March 16th, keen news reporters finally found the news, and on the 17th, the news of the Nazi female spy Bianca's arrest was revealed in various newspapers.</p>
<p>Regarding Bianca's crimes, the authorities have naturally collected a lot of information in the four months since she was detained, but it has not been officially interrogated, so it cannot be published naturally. According to the reporter's collection from all parties, it is roughly like this: Bianca is an Italian girl, 25 years old, and a Japanese spy. She can speak Italian, English, Japanese, and fluent Cantonese. In 1943, she interacted with Japanese military officials in Shanghai, and cohabited with the director of the Japanese Foreign Affairs Office (responsible for espionage work) Fuji and Lieutenant Colonel Kotani, the head of the Japanese naval intelligence department. She had close contacts with Major General Yazaki, the mastermind of the Japanese and Chinese intelligence agencies, and also cohabited with Japanese intelligence personnel Takahashi and Oguchi. When she was in Guangzhou last year, she also cohabited with Simon, the French Vichy government's consul in Guangdong. During the occupation of Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong and other places, she was able to travel back and forth between Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou Bay on Japanese military planes and ships. At that time, these places were all in the hands of the enemy. If she had no relationship with the enemy, would she be allowed to travel so easily and use the enemy's military transportation? Therefore, according to the above points we know, this beautiful Italian girl is naturally not an ordinary person!</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 18th, in the depressed and lonely Boji Hospital, the reporter met Bianca, the female spy who caused a sensation in Guangzhou. She lived in Room 8 on the second floor. The room was spacious, with windows on the northeast sides, and sparse green trees outside. Behind the screen was Bianca's bed. She had a long, pointed face, with rosy cheeks, and her blue-black eyes were like autumn water, setting off her soft golden hair. Her seductive posture was indeed a natural beauty. At that time, she was lying on the bed, covered with a white sheet, revealing a pair of snow-white arms. Her skin was even more clear and clean, as if she were a French girl. She once told the reporter about her life experience. She firmly said that she was not a female spy of any country. She also said that she was Chinese. Since marrying the Chinese Tan Jichao, she has joined Chinese nationality. She had a son and a daughter in Italy. Six years ago, she brought her children to Shanghai, and later had two more daughters. After the Nazis launched the war, she went to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government did not allow her to stay in British territory because she was Italian and asked her to leave the country. In 1942, she returned to Hong Kong again. Life was very difficult at that time, so she went from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, wanting to go to Guangzhou Bay to Guilin to find her husband. At this time, she met Simon because of the relationship between applying for a passport. But after a week in Guangzhou Bay, because the journey to Guilin was too far, she returned to Guangzhou. For the sake of life, Simon often gave her one or two thousand yuan of fake money to maintain her. Soon after receiving the news of her husband's death in battle, she lived with Simon and had another child. Now her eight-year-old son has died, and her nine-year-old, six-year-old, and four-year-old young daughters are being raised by friends in the French church in Shanghai. Finally, she also said that her husband, Mr. Tan, is now in Guangzhou and visits her every day!</p>
<p>In her short speech, she inserted many different expressions. When she was happy, she widened her eyes and raised her voice, as if she was infinitely excited; but sometimes she blinked her eyes and stretched her neck, as if she wanted to cry; and sometimes she made a deep memory. Her words exaggerated that she often caused many people to pester her because of her beauty, and said that many people hated her because they could not get her love; it is a pity that she pretended; but the reporter could not help but think: What a fickle female spy! (To be continued)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A New Development in the Iranian Situation</h3>
<p>The United Nations Security Council convened yesterday in New York, with Mr. Li Taiqi, the representative of our country, serving as chairman. The convening of this meeting was met with considerable expectations from all parties due to the deteriorating situation in Iran, with the belief that the effectiveness of the United Nations mechanism in handling international disputes would be judged by its handling of the Iranian situation. Unexpectedly, three hours before the Security Council convened, the Soviet Union suddenly took a surprising action, with the Iranian authorities officially confirming that the Soviet army had begun withdrawing from Iran; a Moscow broadcast also claimed that the Soviets had reached an agreement with Iran. According to a Reuters report from London on the 24th, a Moscow radio broadcast stated: "According to the treaty signed with Iran during the war, the troops of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States should withdraw from Iran by March 2nd. British and American forces have withdrawn as scheduled. The Soviet Union had previously announced that it would withdraw its troops by March 31st. Soviet troops in areas such as Meshek, Sharut, and Sannan began withdrawing on March 2nd and have completed the withdrawal. The remaining Soviet troops will begin withdrawing on March 24th according to the Soviet-Iranian agreement." The suddenness of this news has led us to admire the flexibility of Soviet diplomatic maneuvers. This news caused the representatives of the United Nations Security Council to turn from sorrow to joy, while also diminishing the interest of people in various countries in this session of the United Nations Council to some extent. We cannot predict whether the United Nations Security Council will further discuss the Iranian situation. However, according to a United Press report from New York on the 25th, the *[missing words]* will continue to discuss, and it is argued that any resolution of the Soviet-Iranian issue should be approved by the Council. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes insisted on the following points: The Council *[missing words]* the Iranian and Soviet *[missing words]* resolution *[missing words]* report; the report should convince the representatives of all countries that the agreement reached between the two countries is out of mutual sincerity and not coercion; the Soviet Union's report to the Council should be regarded as the same as an agreement reached by the United Nations mechanism and Iran.</p>
<p>Simultaneous with the news of the Soviet withdrawal from Iran came a report from Agence France-Presse in Tehran on the 24th, stating that a large number of right-wing Iranian leaders had fled Tehran, including Etreteh Party leader Taiquet and right-wing leader Shaf-pour, who were said to have fled to London. According to a United Press report from Tehran on the 25th, the autonomous movement in Azerbaijan Province will be recognized by the Iranian government. If we combine the Soviet withdrawal, the exile of right-wing Iranian political leaders, and the recognition of the Azerbaijani autonomous movement to observe the new developments in the Iranian situation, it seems not difficult to understand its trends and the subtle relationships within.</p>
<p>First of all, we must point out that the Iranian issue is an international issue. In order to carry out the anti-Axis war, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States agreed to station troops in Iran. When the Soviet Union was fighting the Nazis, much of the supplies provided by the United States to the Soviet Union through the Lend-Lease Act passed through Iran. When the Nazis surrendered, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw their troops from Iran. Britain and the United States withdrew as scheduled, but the Soviet Union, which shared a border with Iran, not only did not comply with the agreement to withdraw its troops, but also intensified its military activities. At the same time, the so-called autonomous movement in Azerbaijan appeared in the area occupied by the Soviet army. Iran appealed to the United Nations mechanism convening in London, while the Soviet Union insisted that the issue between Iran and the Soviet Union should be directly negotiated between Iran and the Soviet Union. Later, the Iranian Prime Minister visited Moscow, but the Soviet authorities treated him coldly. Direct negotiations were ineffective, and the Soviet Union resumed its advance into Iran. This state of affairs continued until the eve of the Security Council meeting. Trying to hide everything from the world's eyes is ultimately impossible. World public opinion was indignant at the Soviet Union's actions. The Soviet Union, seeing this situation, requested the Security Council to postpone the meeting. This was naturally opposed by countries such as China, Britain, and the United States. On the other hand, we saw Chairman Stalin's conversation with a United Press reporter, expressing his trust in the United Nations mechanism and seeking world peace. It was under these circumstances that the Soviet Union suddenly announced the news of its withdrawal from Iran three hours before the Security Council meeting.</p>
<p>If we were to ask what the Soviet Union's motives and significance are for this action, it might seem unkind. However, from the combination of various reports about Iran, and given that the information about Iran's internal situation is still quite incomplete and chaotic, we can roughly understand the trend of the Iranian situation. The exile of right-wing political leaders undoubtedly reflects the rise of pro-Soviet elements and the left wing. The recognition of the Azerbaijani autonomous movement, whether it will merge with the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan in the future, we do not need to predict. Undoubtedly, it is another success of a divisive movement. In summary, we can see that a pro-Soviet regime is preparing to appear in Iran; and the Iranian situation, which was originally an international issue, will evolve into a domestic political issue and thus lose its international character. The success of this strategy will make it impossible for the United Nations mechanism to advise on the Iranian situation again.</p>
<p>Here, we are reminded of the situation in the Northeast. The Soviet army's withdrawal from Shenyang and other areas in the Northeast is also as surprisingly miraculous as the withdrawal from Iran. The Northeast issue was originally an international issue, and has it not recently shown signs of evolving into a domestic political issue? Different tunes played with equal skill, truly a sight to behold. We must raise the awareness of our people and the international community regarding this situation.</p>

<h3>Enemy and Puppet Industry Reviewers Approved; Forced Sales of Real Estate by the Enemy; Original Owners Allowed Priority Repurchase; Third Batch of Eighty-Five Factories Put Up for Auction</h3>
<p>The Review Committee for Handling Enemy and Puppet Industries in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region held its 59th meeting yesterday, passing multiple important cases, including measures for handling real estate forcibly sold by the enemy and puppets and materials seized from secret reports, and a third batch of eighty-five factories to be auctioned. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Measures for Handling Real Estate Cases</p>
<p>Regarding the review committee's decision on handling real estate forcibly sold by the enemy, two measures were decided: (1) For real estate forcibly sold by the enemy, if the original owner provides evidence and the amount of the transaction at that time and applies for the return of property rights, after verification, the original owner may repurchase the property at the then prevailing price, converted into an equivalent amount based on the current price index. If the evidence is insufficient, the handling bureau will estimate the fair price of the real estate and allow the original owner to repurchase it with priority. (2) If the enemy has constructed buildings on the real estate of Chinese citizens that they forcibly occupied, the handling bureau will estimate the fair price of the buildings and allow the landlord to purchase them with priority. Otherwise, the government may purchase the land at market price. If the original owner is unwilling to sell, the government may rent the land at market price. It is also heard that the handling bureau plans to sell off the enemy and puppet real estate that has already been confiscated as quickly as possible, including the Broadway Mansion. Detailed measures are being determined.</p>
<p>Reporting Materials for Sale</p>
<p>The handling bureau has seized a considerable amount of materials from secret reports.

<p>Eighty-Five Factories to Be Auctioned</p>
<p>The handling bureau has previously auctioned two batches of enemy and puppet factories, totaling eighty-two. Yesterday, it approved a third batch of eighty-five factories to be auctioned.

<p>Moving Machinery and Materials for Factory Auction</p>
<p>(3) Due to the houses being returned early or the inconvenience of moving machinery and materials to other factories from the original location, they are auctioned together, including knitting machines from Hamaguchi Foreign Firm, Maruzen Foreign Firm, Matsuura Company, Nanjing Military Uniform Factory, Shanghai Branch Office, Kawai Foreign Firm, Japan Factory, Tongxing Foreign Firm, Nanhua Industry Co., Ltd., clothing from Guangyi Clothing Factory, electrical materials from Toyo Foreign Firm, office furniture and safes from Xingya Steel Factory, etc., Toa Battery Factory, empty distilled water bottles, battery cases, foreign coins from Yamasan Foreign Firm, three large and small oil drums from Hatta Foreign Firm, scrap iron and crushed iron, old iron pipes, copper-plated foreign coins, scrap iron plates from Endou Foreign Firm, office furniture and safes from Shanghai Industry Co., Ltd., working machines and motors from Matsushita Foreign Firm, fire extinguishers and stoves from Ryuki Foreign Firm joint venture, bottles, wooden boxes, furniture, etc., from Fukuoka Foreign Firm, totaling nineteen factories.</p>

It should be sealed and put into the bidding box. If the winning bidder gives up, the deposit will be confiscated and not returned. If the bid is not won, it will be returned after the bidding is opened. In addition, the review committee reserves the right to cancel the winning bid of those who attempt to collude and submit multiple bids. In addition, it also approved the continued return of sixty-six Allied-owned vehicles and decided to auction seven silk factories formerly operated by Japanese merchants in Hangzhou, namely Marusan Shota Mori, Abe City, Eisho, and Iwao, etc.</p>

<h3>Ticket Prices on Two Railways to Increase Next Month; No Official Order Received Yet</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Recently, there have been rumors that the passenger ticket prices on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways will double. Yesterday, the reporter visited the railway authorities in charge. According to them, any increase in train ticket prices requires the approval of the Ministry of Communications. As of yesterday, the city had not received any official order regarding the adjustment of ticket prices. However, prices have risen dramatically in recent months, and ticket prices have not been adjusted in nearly five months. Therefore, the recent income and expenditure of the railway authorities have differed greatly. The rumor of a price increase seems very likely. However, the statement that the new prices will be implemented on April 1st is unfounded.</p>

<h3>Liu Zuoren of Guangdong Provincial Bank Discusses Overseas Chinese Remittance Situation; Large-Scale Tung Tree Farms in Lechang and Lianshan</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Liu Zuoren, the president of Guangdong Provincial Bank, recently came to Shanghai for business. The reporter paid a special visit to inquire about overseas Chinese remittances and the general economic situation in Guangdong. He said: The predecessor of the bank was the Central Bank founded by the late Prime Minister. In 1929, it was changed to the Central Bank of Guangdong Province. In 1932, it was changed to the Guangdong Provincial Bank. After that, it actively operated and gradually expanded. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the bank went through hardships, moved to many places, and continued to operate, so as to regulate local finance. After the victory, the head office moved back to Guangzhou, and branches in various places also resumed operations one after another. In total, there are now 122 units. There are also agency offices overseas, such as in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Macau. Speaking of overseas Chinese remittances, Liu said: Most of the overseas Chinese residing abroad are from Guangdong and Fujian provinces, especially the people of Dongjiang in Guangdong Province who live in the Nanyang area. Therefore, overseas Chinese remittances have made great contributions to the motherland over the years. The bank has always stood in a supporting position in the past, assisting the Bank of China in handling overseas Chinese remittances. In the future, it will continue to make efforts and guide overseas Chinese to remit funds so that they can be included in the path of production. In addition, it will also find ways to facilitate domestic remittances to Guangdong Province. In terms of production, the bank has large-scale tung tree farms near Lechang and Lianshan in northern Guangdong. The area of the two farms is estimated to be about 600,000 mu, with more than 6 million tung trees planted. It is expected that there will be a large harvest in the next two years, which can be supplied to the domestic industrial sector for collection or exported abroad. It is heard that the vastness of this mechanized forest farm is the world's largest.</p>

Any public or private institutions and factories with legitimate needs can directly write to the department to apply without having to indirectly ask someone to help. Once the review is qualified, it can be sold as is. The only type of vehicle currently sold by the department is the one mentioned above. The rumor that there are also jeeps for sale is not true.</p>

Subsequently, representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Ying Zhongjie; the Municipal Government, Zhu Xubai; and societal circles, Wang Jiashu, delivered speeches successively.</p>
<p>Passed Articles of Association Proposals</p>
<p>After the meeting passed the draft articles of association, it proceeded to elect directors and supervisors. It also passed a declaration and three proposals from the preparatory committee: (1) Send a telegram to President Chiang expressing respect. (2) Send letters to the families of journalists who died at the hands of the enemy and puppets expressing condolences. (3) Schedule a memorial service for journalists who sacrificed themselves during the War of Resistance; the resolution was handed to the board of directors for handling. In addition, there were three ad hoc motions: (1) Telegraph President Song, requesting him to quickly select confiscated enemy and puppet houses that are sufficient to accommodate members of the association and use them as journalist apartments, so that journalists without housing can live and work in peace. (2) Request the Ministry of Education and the Municipal Bureau of Education to grant children of deceased journalists who contributed to the War of Resistance propaganda the right to study free of charge in all public schools. (3) In the name of the general meeting, request President Song to quickly allocate the necessary housing for war-effort contributing newspapers and news agencies lacking housing, so that the news industry will not be hampered. The current office spaces already in use must not be forced to relocate under various pretexts to hinder their operations. The resolution was that the above three proposals would be handed over to the board of directors for handling.</p>

<p>General Meeting Issues Declaration</p>
<p>The declaration of the Shanghai Journalists Association comprises six points, which briefly state: Culture is entrusted with the life of the nation and is the way to maintain the life of the nation. We dare not underestimate ourselves, and being cultural warriors, it is our inescapable responsibility to maintain and promote the inherent culture of the nation. This is the first point. The path to national reconstruction has countless threads, but the primary goals are peace and unity. Without peace, there can be no unity; without unity, there can be no stability. Peace and unity are the consistent demands of the entire nation and the only conditions for completing national reconstruction. From now on, no matter who someone is or what party they belong to, their actions that go against peace and unity will not be tolerated by us. This is the second point. Fostering friendly relations and establishing good international relations to maintain lasting world peace is the unified aspiration of our entire nation. However, the so-called friendly relations and lasting peace should be built on the basis of equality and mutual benefit among nations. Frankness, impartiality, and fairness are the conditions for maintaining friendly relations. To deviate from this path is to go in the wrong direction. Our people will not be deceived by conspiracies nor intimidated by military force. The nation first, the people supreme, is the unwavering belief of our entire nation and the creed that all of us will never forget. This is the third point. News reports should be truthful. Distorting facts for self-promotion may deceive for a time but will eventually be exposed to the world. Our duty is to report the truth and inform the readers. Our conscience is not extinguished, and our integrity remains. Regardless of the importance of the matter or the identity of the people involved, we must report the facts without omission. We will not taint our writing with insincere words, so that everything is true and nothing is false. We will not let down the readers nor betray our conscience. This is the fourth point. Upholding justice is also the function of newspapers. We will surely denounce anything that endangers the nation, the people, or world peace, or those who put the interests of their party above the people. We will be the vanguard of the people, and we will not shirk our responsibilities or back down. This is the fifth point. Newspapers are the voice of the people. From now on, we will delve into the people, broadly solicit public opinion, and ensure that all our discussions are what the people want to say and all our records are what the people should know, so as to fully exert the function of newspapers and promote the realization of democratic politics. We hope to complete the construction of a democratic nation based on the Three Principles of the People under the leadership of one government and one leader. This is the sixth point.</p>
<h3>Divorced Couple in Court Dispute Over Daughter's Upbringing Expenses</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] An expatriate Jew in this city named Isaacs, formerly a patrolman and now a mechanic for the American military at Longhua Airport, legally divorced his wife, Louisa, two and a half years ago. They have a young daughter, who was awarded to Louisa's custody. It was agreed at the time that Isaacs would pay Louisa 200 puppet currency dollars per month as the daughter's upbringing expenses. Both parties also agreed to place the daughter in the Sacred Heart Orphanage on the Bund. Louisa would pay the foster care fees each month. Later, both parties agreed to increase the daughter's upbringing expenses to 400 puppet currency dollars per month. In January of this year, Louisa filed a lawsuit with the District Court to demand an increase in the daughter's upbringing expenses. The court accepted the case and ruled on the 20th of last month that the daughter's upbringing expenses would be 20,000 national currency dollars per month, starting from January of this year. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Meixue held a hearing for enforcement. Both Isaacs and Louisa, as well as a Chinese lawyer hired by Isaacs, appeared in court. However, Isaacs only agreed to pay 10,000 dollars. His reason was that, according to the report from the Sacred Heart Orphanage, Louisa had not been paying the orphanage with the upbringing expenses she received from him each month and was already 14 months in arrears. Therefore, the orphanage had notified Isaacs to take the daughter out. His lawyer also claimed that Isaacs only earned 70 US dollars per month. If he had to pay 20,000 dollars per month, it would be equivalent to one-seventh of his salary, which was unbearable. Therefore, he had appealed to the High Court. Louisa, around 35 or 36 years old, upon hearing that Isaacs was unwilling to pay 60,000 dollars (i.e., the upbringing expenses for January to March), started shouting loudly in fluent Shanghai dialect in the courtroom. The judge ruled that she pay 10,000 dollars on the spot and had the court clerk write a receipt. As for the remaining 50,000 dollars, she was ordered to pay it off when the hearing for enforcement was held on April 1st, before she left in a huff.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Administrative Governor Chen Yi Talks About the General Situation in Taiwan, Emphasizing the Restoration of Agriculture and Industry in the Future, and Promoting the Development of Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>Taiwan Administrative Governor Chen Yi flew to Chongqing from Taiwan on official business and arrived in Shanghai on the 24th after completing his official duties. Yesterday, reporters specially visited Mr. Chen's private residence and were received. When asked about the general situation in Taiwan, he provided a detailed account.</p>
<p>Construction Work Has Begun</p>
<p>Mr. Chen stated: Taiwan has been under Japanese rule for over 50 years, and the people's thinking has been deeply restricted. They have little understanding of the country's political, economic, and cultural construction. In particular, the complexity of the language has had a significant impact on education. After the victory, I was ordered to take charge, and my first priority was to promote Mandarin education, which was listed as one of the most important tasks. Currently, all primary and secondary schools in Taiwan have resumed classes and lessons, and textbooks are all using Mandarin teaching. The language and writing are gradually being unified. The current population of Taiwan includes 5.7 million Han people, mostly immigrants from Fujian and Guangdong, and 220,000 indigenous people, including 60,000 Pingpu people (commonly known as "civilized aborigines") and 160,000 mountain people (commonly known as "uncivilized aborigines"). In reality, the indigenous people have mostly become sinicized, with only differences in dialect. There are no special political organizations in the area. In the past, all public security, education, and health work were managed by the Japanese police. Recently, there are plans to promote local autonomy. There were originally over 600,000 Japanese residing in Taiwan, including 180,000 Japanese prisoners of war, 60,000 family members, and 320,000 Japanese expatriates. All the Japanese prisoners of war have been repatriated, and the Japanese expatriates are being repatriated in batches, leaving only 30,000 people. Taiwan is currently lacking in technical and administrative management talent. The establishment of the Taiwan Administrative Cadre Training Group has gradually solved the talent shortage problem. Most of the talent is recruited locally to meet the needs. In summary, the political situation in Taiwan is quite stable, and the construction work in various sectors is just beginning.</p>
<p>Fertilizer Shortage, Orders Placed with the United States</p>
<p>Regarding the economy, Mr. Chen stated: During the war, Taiwan's industry suffered from enemy exploitation and was devastated. On the eve of victory, it was repeatedly bombed, resulting in significant losses. After the takeover, heavy industries such as metallurgy, steelmaking, aluminum smelting, and oil refining have resumed operations, but most of the machinery was manufactured in Japan, and it is difficult to configure damaged parts. Light industries such as ramie weaving, papermaking, and cement have mostly recovered to their original production standards. It is expected that large-scale industries will gradually develop after one year. Taiwan's agriculture requires 400,000 tons of ammonium sulfate fertilizer each year. In the past, it was all supplied by Japan. After the victory, the source was cut off, and there was a sudden fertilizer panic. Therefore, this year's grain harvest was poor. Taiwan produces three crops of rice a year, which can yield over 17 million dan. In previous years, over 5 million dan were transported to Japan, leaving over 10 million dan for self-sufficiency. This year, only 9 million dan were produced, and even if all of it is used for self-sufficiency, it is still short 700,000 dan. We can only supplement it with miscellaneous grains. Taiwan can produce 1 million tons of miscellaneous grains each year. This year, the area planted with sugarcane is not large, producing only 100,000 tons, which is only enough for self-sufficiency. To quickly restore agricultural production, we have currently contacted the United States and Canada to purchase fertilizer. In the second half of the year, we can obtain a supply of 200,000 tons of ammonium sulfate. It is expected that next year's agricultural production will be a bumper harvest.</p>
<p>Stable Finances, Stable Prices</p>
<p>Finance in Taiwan is currently quite stable. The exchange rate for civil servants' remittances is temporarily calculated at 1 New Taiwan Dollar to 30 National Currency Dollars. Also, 1 US military scrip dollar currently exchanges for 1 New Taiwan Dollar, which is equivalent to 15 New Taiwan Dollars per US dollar. The currency value is stable, and commodity prices are not expected to fluctuate drastically. However, due to transportation difficulties, Taiwan's foreign trade has not yet developed, and some special products still cannot be exported. As for future plans for the construction of Taiwan, Mr. Chen specifically listed four points: (1) Restore agriculture and industry; (2) Develop higher education (Taiwan has no universities); (3) Restore transportation; (4) Promote foreign trade.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Mr. Chen is scheduled to fly back to his post within days. Also, a batch of 1,200 staff members of the Governor's Office, traveling from Shanghai on the Taipei wheel, arrived in Taiwan on the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>World Professional Women's Day: The YWCA Held a Commemorative Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Yesterday was World Professional Women's Day. The YWCA of this city held a commemorative meeting at 6:00 PM yesterday at the Ninth Floor of the YWCA at Baxianqiao. Over 200 women representatives from various agencies in this city, professional women, and women from various countries such as Britain, America, the Soviet Union, Australia, and Portugal attended. Dr. Tan Mingde served as the chairman. Speakers included Mrs. Fan Haige, one of the initiators of "World Professional Women's Day" in China, Mrs. Anderson, Ms. Peng Wangquan, a professor at St. John's University, and Ms. Lei Jieqiong, a professor at Soochow University. The central theme of the speeches was "In This World—My Rights and My Obligations." They deeply hoped that professional women around the world can work together to strive for peace and equality. Representatives from the International Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Soviet Women's Association also delivered speeches. After the speeches, a potluck dinner was held. Each participating member paid a potluck fee of 1,500 dollars. Afterwards, a variety of entertainment programs began, including violin solos, sword dances, and a short play introducing female heroes of Chinese history, directed by professional female artists and performed by professional women. The meeting dispersed in high spirits at 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Drunk Man Fell into a Well and Drowned</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Zhou Hongzhi, a 52-year-old man from Shandong, who was blind in his right eye, worked as a watchman at Lane 58, Wujiang Road, i.e., Xiejiao Lane. He lived alone and struggled to make a living. He was fond of drinking and usually relied on the assistance of people in the neighborhood to survive. The night before last, he again indulged in heavy drinking until late at night. Unexpectedly, when walking to the entrance of the lane, he accidentally fell into a well and drowned. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, a tenant surnamed Ke from No. 56 discovered the incident and reported it to the New Cheng Police Station, which ordered the police to go to the scene and retrieve the body. The body was sent to the coroner for examination.</p>
<h3>The Truth About a Human Leg Revealed</h3>
<p>Foot Amputated from a Hospital Patient</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, around 2:00 PM, a human leg was discovered next to the swimming pool in the Shanghai Experimental Drama School at 961 North Sichuan Road. The leg was already showing signs of partial decay. The incident was reported to the North Sichuan Road Police Station. Station Chief Zeng Derong, along with Criminal Section Chief Zhou Nan, patrol officer Liu Zhaonian, and Sergeant Chen Junfeng, led the way to the scene to investigate. The investigation revealed that the leg belonged to the right leg of a man. Although some of the flesh was blurred and difficult to identify, a close examination of the skin did not resemble that of a coolie, but it was also not like that of a scholar. However, the bone was very smooth, as if it had been sawn off. Section Chief Zhou led Sergeant Chen out to the Shanghai Municipal Fourth Hospital (formerly Fumin Hospital) next door to inquire whether anyone had had a leg amputated recently. According to the response, a person had had a right leg amputated three or four days ago. The patient currently resided in Room 110 upstairs. He was a soldier sent by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration named Gao Mingchun. Because the leg was fractured and medical treatment was ineffective, the doctor diagnosed that it had to be amputated. After the surgery, the leg was amputated and placed in the morgue in the back. Because the drama school and the hospital were only separated by an iron gate, it was carried out by a stray dog and placed on the wasteland. The flesh was blurred, likely due to being eaten by the dog. Subsequently, Dr. Shi from the hospital rushed to identify the leg as his and immediately took it back. This finally resolved the doubts.</p>
<h3>Newspapers and Weeklies Temporarily Suspended from Airmail Delivery</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration recently announced: Approved the Shanghai Office of China National Aviation Corporation's public letter dated March 15 of this year, which stated: "Our company only accepts airmail letters for transportation from post offices in various places. As for airmail parcels and newspapers, etc., we should immediately notify the senders to contact our company's Shanghai Office directly. If the aircraft has capacity, freight will be charged according to the cargo freight rates for transportation," etc. Approving this, our bureau has repeatedly negotiated with the company, but no results have been obtained. As of today, our bureau has accumulated many newspaper bags to be sent to various places, which cannot be cleared. Therefore, our bureau has no choice but to suspend the acceptance and delivery of all newspapers and weeklies to Shanghai-Chongqing, Shanghai-Guangdong, Shanghai-Beiping, and Shanghai-Taiwan routes from today. Also, the 29th is a regular holiday. The office hours of the Administration and its branches will be handled according to the Sunday regulations.</p>
<h3>Theater Owners Don't Actually Receive Much After Movie Ticket Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Association Chairman Issues Statement</p>
<p>Regarding the increase in movie ticket prices, Liang Qitian, the chairman of the Movie Theater Business Association, stated that the increase in ticket prices was a last resort. This is because various expenses have increased sharply. If adjustments are not made, it will be difficult for various theaters to maintain operations. However, the current selling price is still cheaper than other commodity prices. Even in terms of the entertainment industry, the highest price for amusement parks before the war was 2 jiao, which is now sold for 300 dollars. The highest price for dramas was 1 yuan, which is now sold for 2,500 dollars. The highest price for movies was 2 yuan, which is now sold for 1,800 dollars. Moreover, out of the 1,800 dollars, 50% is entertainment tax, which is 600 dollars, 10% is stamp duty, which is 120 dollars, and 540 dollars is split with the film distributor. The theater actually only receives 540 dollars.</p>

<h3>Zhongyuan Dyeing and Weaving Factory Launches Special-Priced Sales to Teachers</h3>
<p>The Right to Enjoy Special Price Purchase Certificates</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Seeing recent reports that the sacred teachers, due to livelihood issues, hope to obtain a slightly reasonable solution, and have engaged in strike actions, we, standing on the national standpoint, cannot but be concerned about this serious issue. The War of Resistance has been won, but the national finances are in a difficult and troubled period, and it may be difficult to immediately remedy this problem. Especially the parents of students, most of whom are also struggling to pay their children's tuition fees, so additional fees are out of the question. However, the cost of living index and the meager income of teachers are too far apart, and the strike wave will become a social problem for the entire society. We, as a production institution, are also a member of the current society, and are willing to automatically contribute to the sacred teachers, even if it is only a slight contribution. Although it is minimal, if all parties can do the same, the teachers' living burden can be reduced to some extent. Now, we will propose a method: All teachers in public and private schools in this city, the school authorities will contact various daily necessities production factories to widely issue them a daily necessities special price purchase certificate. With the certificate, they can enjoy a special price discount, in order to reduce their spending burden. Our Zhongyuan Dyeing and Weaving Factory produces Double Ten brand towels and various cotton woven goods, and we are willing to make an attempt. If other daily necessities factories adopt the same method, it can indeed help teachers in their living aspects. I wonder what readers think? Respectfully,</p>
<p>Zhongyuan Dyeing and Weaving Factory Co., Ltd.</p>
<h3>Brief Service Report</h3>

Due to my carelessness, I lost a handbag containing items worth approximately 300,000 yuan (all bought in America).

<h3>No Registration Applications from Dealers; Gold Market Weak; Hong Kong Currency Hottest Among Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange rate continued to depend on Bank of China's supply, and the black market sources were constant. Although the allotted price was still 1.6 million, it had not changed. Dealers had not registered, and there was no hope for the overall trend. Sellers were hesitant, and the process was consistently weak. It opened steadily in the morning, but soon after opening, a certain pressure increased, gradually falling back. After 10 o'clock, the Bank of China's allotment price did not change. Dealers, due to the low market price, did not register. However, the pressure was frequent, and the market gradually weakened, retreating to 1.54 million at noon, and then slightly recovering, but only temporarily. In the afternoon, it still proved unsustainable, first weakening and then stabilizing. The result was a slight decrease of 15,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were listed at 170,000 yuan, refined silver at 1,600, and silver dollars were bought at 1,050 yuan, showing great stability. The secret exchange rate was average, and the interest rate ranged from 1.6 to 2 jiao. The Bank of China had abundant gold reserves, and speculators could not operate. The gold market presented a clear, stable, and secretly weak image, and the trend was difficult to reverse.</p>
<p>Foreign currency U.S. dollars were initially strong and then weakened, initially hovering around 1,980 yuan. After entering the market, the gold market fell, and the U.S. dollar was also affected. At noon, it was around 1,960 yuan. In the afternoon, the gold market rose after falling, but the U.S. dollar still ended at a low price, falling 20 to 30 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong currency was consistently weak and could not be stopped, falling another 10 yuan. New issues recovered slightly. Although there was no new stimulus, the chips were scarcer, making it easier to pull up. In 1936, it once rose to 235 yuan and then slightly fell back. There was more currency in circulation in 1937, lagging behind by 20 yuan, and finally recovering by 10 yuan and 20 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers and rupees were calm.</p>
<h3>Bulls Successively Selling Off Securities Suddenly Decline; Chinese Stocks Recovered to Original State at Noon Due to Sichuan Group's Unwillingness to Release</h3>
<p>Yesterday, major players in the government bond market deliberately created a trap to entice others. As soon as it opened, they raised prices. Type C bonds were raised from 3,000 yuan in the morning to around 3,150 yuan, and the bulls felt satisfied and sold off together. Soon after, it broke into the 3,000 yuan level. The Chinese stock market also weakened due to the bulls taking profits. Retail investors in the bond market panicked, and supply exceeded demand, gradually decreasing to 2,600 yuan. The noon close was slightly even. Compared to the previous close, Types A, B, D, and E all fell by 200 yuan, with the hottest Type C bonds falling by 300 yuan. The Chinese stock market was in a confusing situation. Part of the bull force left the market, and frequent drops occurred. However, the Sichuan group held onto the chips and refused to release them, using its huge capital to increase positions at low prices. The floating chips in the market became fewer and fewer. Speculators bought in to cover their positions before the close, and the market recovered. At low prices, Yong Yarn was 4,600 yuan, Meiya 3,580 yuan, and Jingfu broke into the 300 yuan level. The noon close was still able to recover to its original state. Compared to the previous close, popular stocks rose slightly, while unpopular small stocks remained flat. In the afternoon, forward transactions for Yong Yarn, Meiya, and Jingfu were quoted at premiums of 5% to 10%. Foreign stocks opened later, just in time for the Chinese stock and bond markets to recover, and showed a weakening trend as soon as they opened. Yisha gradually decreased from 10,200 yuan to 9,600 yuan, and finally hovered around the 10,000 yuan level, resulting in a decline of 5% to 10% compared to the previous close.</p>
<h3>Rice and Oil Steady; Flour from Lively to Dull</h3>
<p>Although the rice market shouted tightly in the morning, there were still goods in the warehouses, and store demand was not strong, so the result was still average. Flour from other ports turned dull, and the situation softened. Oil prices tended to be flat with the continued arrival of goods from other places. Soybeans were initially high and then weakened, with both arrival and demand being sluggish. Raw peanuts were still stable. Corn was scarce and quite flexible, with prices rising by 700 to 800 yuan. Bran also rose by 200 to 300 yuan. Soybean cake was flat and weak. Most grains were mostly flat.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Demand Gradually Weakens; Yarn and Thread Decline Consistently</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market turned weak again. Cantonese demand has gradually weakened. 20-count special Double Horse yarn fell to 1.1 million. Beijing dealers chose and purchased cheap coarse yarn. Cloth factories and weaving factories had no intention of stocking up due to the sluggish sales of finished products, so various counts of yarn and thread declined by 20,000 to 30,000. Prices have not stabilized. The Textile Construction Company opened for sale as usual a total of 11 types of cotton cloth and added 10 types of American cloth.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Transactions Still Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York's American cotton continued to rise by 6 to 12 basis points, with near-term cotton at US$27.08 and no market for far-term cotton. Midling spot was US$27.76. Spot cotton transactions in this port were still good, but the market was still lifeless, because the yarn and cloth markets were all downstream, and factories were unwilling to release prices and absorb inventory. Those holding goods were willing to compromise. Only the Textile Construction Company purchased 1,500 to 1,600 bales of Midling cotton at prices ranging from 76,000 to 78,000 to 80,000 yuan. No private yarn factories or cotton brokers were heard to be doing business.</p>
<h3>Silk Buyers Wait and See; Rayon Falls by 60,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was uniformly weak, mainly because buyers were all waiting and seeing. Most prices were quoted but no transactions were made. Factory silk of 80 points or more, the foreign firm's goods, yesterday had a negotiated price of 2.55 million yuan per bale, but no one cared because the payment terms required several days' promissory notes, separate guarantees, and dry commissions. Quoted prices were short. 120-count Tianqiao rayon opened at 1.74 million yuan, then fell to 1.7 million yuan at closing, a decrease of 60,000 yuan from the previous day. Dull and semi-dull were short of goods and prices were held up. 120-count Laisi end dull had transactions at 2.78 million yuan. The price of Meiya quilt face in the silk market was the same as the previous day, but there were no transactions. Dachang lattice crepe factories sold off goods, and prices were 100 yuan weaker than the previous day. Business was not bad. The quality of power spinning and 205 foreign spinning fabrics was uneven, and the prices were also very different.</p>
<h3>Wire Nails Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Sales of wire nails to customers have been extremely prosperous in the past, but in the last half month, the purchasing power of customers has been limited, so the market has become increasingly worse, falling by another 10% to 20% compared to two weeks ago. The current price for 4-fen nails is 92,000 yuan per barrel, 5-fen nails are 82,000 yuan, 6-fen nails are 72,000 yuan, 1-inch nails are 65,000 yuan, 1.5-inch nails are 60,000 yuan, 2-inch nails are 53,000 yuan, and 2.5-inch and 3-inch nails are 50,000 yuan per barrel.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Calm; Coal Briquette Factory Prices Remain Stable</h3>
<p>The coal market is quiet, with only a few scattered transactions. The market is gradually becoming calm, and price fluctuations are minimal. Although there is a shortage of white coal lumps, the market price is too high, which hinders actual sales, resulting in a shortage of both supply and demand. The market price continued to fall slightly by 10,000 yuan. Although the main raw materials for coal briquettes, Dashan and white coal layers, have fallen significantly in recent days, the factory prices remain stable due to the sharp increase in labor costs and the continuous spring rain, which has reduced production in various factories, and the rising price of firewood. It will be difficult to fall back in the short term.</p>
<h3>U.S. Needs Antimony Very Much; Regret Limited Price Is Too Low</h3>
<p>(Reuters, New York, 26th) Antimony is currently in great need in the United States, and the only remedy depends on the return of the large amount of antimony ore produced in China to the U.S. market. However, the price of antimony on the current world market is much higher than the price limit in the United States, so the United States seems to need to reward its citizens for purchasing antimony from China.</p>
<h3>Glass Fiber Can Replace Rayon</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Rayon, the raw material for electrical wire weaving factories, is now no longer scarce. A large foreign firm in this city has begun accepting orders for glass fiber (Glorsfeber), which is a rubbery fiber with extremely strong tensile strength. It is an excellent raw material to replace rayon. The United States uses glass fiber to weave parachutes and also widely uses this raw material. The price is approximately 300,000 yuan per box (200 pounds).</p>
<h3>5,000 Tons of Pig Iron to Arrive in Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] General iron shops on North Suzhou Road have ordered 5,000 tons of pig iron from a large British firm at US$63 per ton, which will arrive in Shanghai soon. This shipment will alleviate the shortage of raw materials needed by foundries and iron factories. It is also reported that a large batch of lead wire arrived in Shanghai this spring, which was surplus material from the U.S. military. A large iron shop purchased the entire batch at US$8 per dan, and it has already been sold out after being loaded, which shows the lack of metal materials in this city.</p>
<h3>Tea Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>The earliest Mingqian Longjing new tea is produced in Wenzhou, Zhejiang. Generally, it can be tasted at the end of this month. However, according to news from the production area, although the weather last year was not severely cold, the spring rain has been continuous at the time when the new tea is about to grow, so production may be affected, and the harvest is not optimistic. As for the tea market in this city in recent days, sales in Tianjin and other places and in shops on this street are very sluggish. Generally, sellers' profits are frequently loose. Under the trend of supply exceeding demand, the market is weak, and prices have rarely improved.</p>
<h3>Soviet Gold Production Increased During the War Compared to Before the War; Gold Reserves About One-Fifth of the United States'</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 26th] The Soviet Union is one of the major gold-producing countries, but it never publishes production figures. According to Paul Hull's article in the New Pioneer Forum, the Soviet Union's gold reserves are second only to the United States. When the Soviet Union was a member of the League of Nations in 1936, the League's Statistical Yearbook recorded the Soviet Union's gold reserves as 47,371,000 ounces. According to the U.S. Bureau of Mines, the Soviet Union's production in 1936 was 5 million ounces. From 1937 to the end of 1945, the Soviet Union's production should have been 71.5 million ounces, of which only 4 million ounces were exported. Therefore, it is estimated that the Soviet Union's gold reserves should be 120 million ounces, about 21% of the United States' gold reserves. According to Hull's estimates based on reports from foreign engineers employed by the Soviet Union, the current Soviet gold production is equal to or even exceeds that of South Africa. South Africa produced 12 million ounces of gold in 1944. According to Soviet publications, Soviet gold production increased during the war, which is the opposite of other parts of the world.</p>
<h3>Mobile Homes</h3>
<p>England Also Prepares to Export in Large Quantities</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 26th) According to the "Standard Evening News": British mobile home manufacturers, with the support of the Ministry of Works, are currently planning to establish an export trade worth 100 million pounds. It is reported that the Australian government has ordered three types of mobile homes from the United States, and the models have already arrived in Sydney. Currently, there is a housing panic in various countries around the world. After meeting domestic needs, Britain can engage in large-scale exports.</p>
<h3>Market Intelligence Summary</h3>
<p>Sugar: Yesterday afternoon, the Enemy Property Administration entrusted the Guild to hold the 16th wholesale auction, totaling 2,374 bags of medium sugar at 49,000 yuan per dan, but because dealers' demand was very sluggish, only 1,577 bags were actually sold. Medium sugar opened in the morning and fell to 48,250 yuan, and refined sugar was also dragged down by 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: Because sales of colored cloth have been sluggish, almost no one is interested in white fine cloth, and prices are uniformly weak.</p>
<p>Woolen Cloth: Retail sales are few, and Yin Feng Paisley fell by another 2,500 yuan, with few other gains or losses.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Huang Xiangmao and Scissors Soap had retail sellers dumping goods, slightly declining. Western candles were brisk because customers absorbed them.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: The market opened with weak sentiment. Except for Great Britain's Old Knife, which was stable, the rest were uneven.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine: Clear water tremella, recently because more goods have arrived, fell by a strong 15%, and the rest are also trending weak.</p>
<p>Western Medicine: Penicillin's price has fallen sharply due to the impact of arrivals, and the rest are also trending downstream. Medical cotton has risen due to the shortage of goods.</p>
<p>Cosmetics: Snow powder is in short supply because dealers are still eagerly collecting, and the factory rarely supplies it, so prices have risen, and the rest are flat.</p>
<p>Dyes: The downward trend still exists, and prices continue to fall, but Three Doves Soap Yellow has strong sales and prices have risen.</p>
<p>Industrial Raw Materials: The market is mediocre, and prices are hovering. Also, a batch of caustic soda shipped from Rinira has been scheduled to be delivered and marketed in the next two days.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University Tang Ping Two Colleges Prepare to Return; Abandon the Waterway Relocation Plan; Make Contact with the Sichuan-Shaanxi Railway Bureau and Transfer Northward</h3>
<p>[Special report from Bishan] In order to adapt to the school relocation plan, Tangshan College and Peiping Railway Management College of Jiaotong University ended this semester early in early May. At the meeting of schools relocating inward convened by the Ministry of Education last month, the relocation order of the two colleges was set at 38 batches. According to the transportation tools transferred by the Ministry of Communications to the schools for repatriation, at the rate of 10,000 people per month, it will be possible to leave Chongqing in late August. After hearing the news, the teachers, students, and alumni of the two colleges were quite anxious. It is learned that the two colleges have abandoned the waterway relocation plan and have made contact with the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway Bureau. The Bureau has allocated vehicles to go through the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road to Guangyuan, arrive at Tianshui, and transfer northward along the Longhai Road. Food and lodging along the way are arranged and planned by the alumni association. It is said that Wu Jinghu and Liu Zhijing, who were specially sent by the two colleges to Tangshan and Peiping to receive school buildings, arrived in Peiping on the 12th. The two were quite successful in negotiating the school buildings in Peiping, but the Tangshan school buildings are currently borrowed by the US military and may not be released in the short term. President Gu Yisun and Chief Secretary Geng Shizhi also decided to fly to Peiping in early April to handle the repatriation matters. This summer, the two colleges are scheduled to recruit new students in Beijing, Shanghai, Peiping and Tianjin, so that young people interested in transportation can apply nearby. (Sealed)</p>

<h3>From Now on, Fujian and Taiwan Will Share Teacher Resources; Abbreviation of Fujian Teachers College</h3>
<p>— Huang Cen</p>
<p>In the past, culture and education in Fujian were relatively backward. Leaving aside higher education, even in terms of secondary schools: according to pre-war statistics, there were actually less than sixty schools; and among them, most were private schools founded by churches or individuals. Actual public secondary schools were as rare as phoenix feathers, and these secondary schools were concentrated in Fuzhou, Putian, Xiamen, and other major areas. More than ten counties in eastern and western Fujian did not even have a single high school. Fortunately, the War of Resistance brought Fujian the desire to not fall behind. In the midst of turmoil, it slowly began to raise its head. The Fujian Provincial Education Bureau also gradually completed its plan in the first six years, on the one hand, striving to support the independent development of education in various counties, so that each county had at least one county-run junior high school and a simple normal class; on the other hand, dividing the province into nine secondary school districts according to administrative divisions, so that each district had at least one complete secondary school, ordinary normal school, and vocational schools for agriculture, fisheries, medical care, industry, etc., according to local special needs. As a result of the implementation of these plans, secondary education in Fujian Province and its popularization have undoubtedly been achieved. However, because of the excessive expansion of quantity, the quality has gradually declined. Therefore, the "Fujian Normal College," which aims to solve the problem of overall teacher resources, came into being.</p>
<p>Past History</p>
<p>The predecessor of the Teachers College was the "Secondary School Teacher Training Institute" founded by Chen Yi, the former chairman of Fujian Province. The original site was in Shaxian. At that time, there were several departments such as Literature, History, Geography, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Music, and Physical Education. It specialized in recruiting high school normal school graduates and selecting excellent primary school teachers from various counties for further study. The duration of study was two years. After graduation, the province assigned them to serve in secondary schools in various counties. During their time at the school, all food and clothing were provided by the province, so poor students from various places were often happy to study there. In 1942, in view of the fact that the original scale was not sufficient for expansion, it was changed to the Provincial Teachers College. The school site was moved to a small village in Hougu, Shuinan, Nanping. The first president was Tang Shouyi. Famous novelist Zhang Jin Yi and painter Wu Fuzhi and other teachers taught here at this time.</p>
<p>Internal Organization</p>
<p>Now the Teachers College has been expanded into six departments including Chinese Language, History and Geography, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, Education, Art and Physical Education. This semester, it moved to Fuzhou and added an English department, hiring Dr. Lin Tianlan as the director. However, in order to adapt to the actual teaching needs, except for the Art and Physical Education departments, students in each department can cross-select courses, such as Chinese Language majors can also select History and Geography and English, History and Geography majors can also select Chinese Language and English, and Education majors can also select Chinese Language, History and Geography, etc. The academic system also adopts a credit system, with graduation in three years. There are two methods for enrollment: one is the recommendation from each county of outstanding primary school teachers "with graduation qualifications from high schools of equal status", and the other is high school and ordinary normal school graduates. Those with equivalent academic ability will not be accepted. The current president is Lin Xilian, speaker of the Fujian Provincial Assembly, but the actual school affairs are handled by Yan Hu, the director of academic affairs. (It is said that Mr. Yan is the son of Mr. Yan Fu and has a deep understanding of Chinese Language due to his family's academic background). There are four departments and one office in the school. In the past, the selection of professors was not ideal due to regional limitations. Now that the school has moved to Rongcheng, solutions can be sought.</p>
<p>Student Activities</p>
<p>The number of students will reach nearly 400, most of whom are normal school graduates. Some of them have served in society for eight or nine years, and have been principals, section chiefs, and counselors, before returning to the gates of the school, so their experience, knowledge, and ability are relatively rich. In terms of academics: because they will soon become teachers after stepping out of the school gate, the second and third grade students almost bury themselves in books all day long, reviewing and dare not stop for a moment. In terms of service: because they have long been accustomed to it in peacetime, they often have special achievements in technology. As for student activities, because there are all kinds of talents, they are also particularly active. For example, publishing periodicals and printing teaching materials can be undertaken by Chinese Language, History, Geography, and Education departments; drawing and surveying can be the responsibility of History, Geography, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry departments. Physical education competitions are handled by the Physical Education department alone. Practice exhibitions are hosted by the Art department. Everything is extremely automatic, active, and competent. Student life sweeps away the extravagant habits of the city. Not only has the act of wearing suits and leather shoes, and guessing fingers while drinking disappeared, but even daily clothes and utensils are washed and managed by the students themselves. The hard life of one or two students is particularly touching.</p>
<p>Future Plans</p>
<p>At present, all sectors of Fujian Province, in view of the need to improve the quality of education after the war, want to transform the Teachers College into a normal college. As for the path, there are two: (1) to merge with the Provincial Medical and Agricultural Colleges to form "National Linsen University", making it the highest institution of learning in northeastern Fujian. (2) to suggest that the central government change the Teachers College into an independent college so that it can meet the large-scale needs of teachers in Fujian and Taiwan provinces in the future. The former has been proposed to the central government by members of the Fujian Provincial Political Council, and once passed by the Executive Yuan, but has not been realized to this day. The latter has been discussed with the Ministry of Education by the members of the Fujian Province who attended the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and it is said that there is a good chance of success. We have observed the phenomenon of the depletion of secondary school personnel in Fujian Province, and in view of the urgent need for Mandarin education in Taiwan in the future (it is said that the Minnan students of the Teachers College in the two sessions account for one-third of the total number, and sending them to Taiwan can easily solve the teaching language issue), it is really necessary to transform the school into a college, and we hope that the education authorities will support it as soon as possible!</p>

<h3>Shenyang Soviet Army Withdrawal Station Damaged; Endless Sorrows of the Beining Railway</h3>
<p>— Shenyang Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 18th (Airmail) — Special Correspondent Han Qingtao</p>
<p>The Beining Railway, this new lifeline of the Northeast, should be fully open to traffic today, after the withdrawal of the Soviet army from Shenyang. However, because the main station has been damaged, Huanggu Village Station is still used as the terminus. The distance between Huanggu Village and the main station is less than ten miles, but it is still "close at hand, yet worlds apart," and cannot be reached!</p>
<p>Inside Shanhaiguan, passengers are very crowded and road affairs need to be rectified. The section outside Shanhaiguan between Shanhaiguan and Jinzhou has even more sorrows. Passengers coming by train from inside the pass generally have to change trains in Jinzhou, and cold and hardship attack everyone.</p>
<p>The blockage at the top of the Beining Railway has not yet healed, and problems often occur throughout the line. The problems mostly occur at important joints, that is, the Communist army's planned bombing of bridges, which prevents the railway from being smooth and unobstructed.</p>
<p>Plainclothes Team Bombs Bridges and Flees Immediately</p>
<p>The route is long, with more than 100 large and small bridges between Goubangzi and Xinmin alone. Except for the very long bridges, such as the Juliuhe Bridge, where the National Army has special guards, troops cannot be stationed everywhere else. This gave the Communist army an opportunity to take advantage of. They mostly use the night, sending a plainclothes team, carrying explosives, to walk to the predetermined target. In a deafening explosion, the task is achieved, and they flee immediately. By the time the National Army arrives, they have already disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>The Zhao Village Machine and the Raoyanghe Bridge and the Liuhegou Bridge, which have been bombed recently, have all had the damaged parts temporarily supported from the bottom of the river with sleepers by bridge workers. What will happen when the water rises in the future? What's more, there is constant destruction, which is really frightening to think about.</p>
<p>Some people have also thought about the time when the "green gauze tent" rises. The six- or seven-foot-tall sorghum stalks are a good place to hide large numbers of people. In the past, bandits were rampant in the Northeast during the summer, which was a major reason. The enemy, Japan, did not allow farmers to plant sorghum within ten miles on both sides of the railway to maintain railway traffic. But now it is our own countrymen's business, and everything must be planned and solved reasonably by ourselves.</p>
<p>On the section outside Shanhaiguan of the former Beining Railway, it is a double-track hidden road. Except for two or three bridges that have not yet been repaired into double tracks and have to temporarily stop and run on a single track, the rest are for both up and down traffic, without any obstruction. However, many places have now been damaged, and there are also overturned locomotives and carriages lying there, which have not been repaired and cleared. Therefore, the train runs on the left at one station, and at the next station, it may have to run on the right again.</p>
<p>Station Equipment Stopped Being Used</p>
<p>The electrical management and equipment of large and small stations are now stopped from being used. The switches and signals are lost or broken. The wires leading to the outside of the station have been taken away, and even the red and green signal lights outside the station are gone. The more times the chaos occurs, the more difficult it is to calculate this confusing account.</p>
<p>Along the line, inspections inside and outside the stations are rarely done. The switches are rusted and no one cares, the equipment is broken and no one repairs it. Cleanliness and order are a mess. A railway worker lamented, "In the puppet Manchurian era, the stationmaster had to inspect the station affairs at least once a week, wearing white gloves. If yellow rust was rubbed on the switch, the personnel managing the switch would suffer. So they wiped it all the time, so it was bright, clean, and efficient. Alas, no one has cared about it for more than half a year now." The reporter personally saw a large station where locomotives get coal and water, and the switch was rusted. The person who switched the switch spent half a day's effort to barely cope with the job.</p>
<p>Railway Workers' Salaries Are Being Adjusted</p>
<p>All the railway workers are generally diligent, but some of the equipment on the road has been destroyed, and some has rotted and decayed, so sloppiness has begun, and everyone tries to cope with the situation, which is terrible.</p>
<p>The salary issue is said to be being adjusted now. In February, a stationmaster received only about 2,000 Northeast circulation coupons, which is equivalent to 26,000 yuan in national currency. The price level and the exchange rate of legal currency are almost the same as in the interior, so how can they eat and support their families. Therefore, many stationmasters and railway workers are dressed very raggedly.</p>
<p>The general opinion is that railway workers' salaries must be reasonable, and the good regulations on the road in the past must be retained and maintained, because the enemy puppets managed the railway in an orderly manner in the past, and the work was carried out quickly and effectively. Today, it cannot be "written off".</p>
<p>Frozen for Most of the Night; Baby Nowhere to be Found</p>
<p>There is a shortage of locomotives and wagons on the road. Many have been taken away by the Soviet army. A passenger train runs north and south each day, and passengers are extremely crowded. There is no room to stand in the carriage, and the door is also crowded with water. The place where the two armies handed over is also full of people. Some people don't even have anything to grab, so they have to use ropes to tie or hang themselves on the train. What's even worse is that the roof is full of passengers. This may be easily ignored in the interior, but here the weather is icy and snowy. When the train runs, the cold wind is like a steel knife cutting people, and they can be frozen stiff. A few days ago, a female passenger came from Jinzhou and was frozen for most of the night. When she arrived in Goubangzi, the sun was high before she realized that the two-month-old child wrapped in the quilt was gone!</p>
<p>Hanging a Military Car; One Section Is Not Enough</p>
<p>Where do these passengers come from? And why not add more trains? The answer is: there is a shortage of both wagons and locomotives. What can be used to run on the railway? The people of the Northeast are now very poor, so they travel to and from Tianjin and Beijing to do small business, carrying small packages of goods on their shoulders, enduring almost unbearable pain. Half of the passengers are this kind of people, and the other half are visiting relatives and friends, because travel was subject to many restrictions in the puppet Manchurian era. What's more, there is a "national border" between inside and outside the pass?</p>
<p>There are also many military personnel on official business traveling between Jin County and Shenyang, so a single car for military personnel is not enough, and they have to be mixed among ordinary passengers. Therefore, many military personnel are also sitting on passenger trains.</p>
<p>More Dangerous When Encountering Big Noses</p>
<p>It is extremely difficult to buy tickets when there are many people. A few days ago, the train from Jinzhou was scheduled to depart at 6:00 in the morning. General passengers would line up in the middle of the night. Some would go there and sit down after the night fell, tired, sitting on luggage or goods, taking a nap. It is impossible to describe the suffering, because it is still icy and snowy outside the pass, and the cold wind is piercing!</p>
<p>The train arrives at Huanggu Village just as it gets dark. Everyone cannot go into the city, because before the Soviet army withdrew, everyone was afraid of encountering the "big noses". If they unfortunately encountered them, they would have to offer most of the money on their bodies, and other things might also be taken away, so they had to stay in a hotel.</p>
<p>Living in Their Own House During the Day; Recruiting Passengers at Night</p>
<p>Huanggu Village was not originally the terminus, and there are not many hotels. All the people on the train had to live there. So the households slept in their own house during the day and recruited passengers at night, costing 15 to 30 yuan per person (13 yuan per legal currency). When there were more people, everyone sat. When there were fewer people, they could lie down. What could people do? Because the people who were going to Jinzhou the next day also had to rush to stay here, so every house in Huanggu Village was a hotel, and there were people everywhere. Everyone suffered, and the households received unexpected gains. Large and small houses made a lot of money every day.</p>
<p>From March 16th, the departure time from Jinzhou was changed to 10:00 AM. The train arrives at Huanggu Village at 8:00 or 9:00 PM, just in time for the evening curfew. In Shenyang, few people walk after 6:00 PM until dawn. Huanggu Village Station is so chaotic, so the stop was changed to Xinmin. There are formal hotels near Xinmin Station, but most of the merchants who are seeking small profits mostly stay in the wagons and on the roof. Otherwise, they would have to spend money and be afraid of not being able to get on the train. In their opinion, this method is already very satisfying, because in the end, they are all Chinese people and will not be bullied or disturbed. It is currently difficult for Northeast compatriots to make a living and travel.</p>
<p>There are so many problems on the Beining Railway between Shanhaiguan and Shenyang, and the passengers are suffering so much. We need to quickly rectify and seek ways to save and improve. This new lifeline of the Northeast cannot be allowed to continue like this. (Shenyang, March 18)</p>
<h3>The Gloomy State of Education in Guangzhou: School-Age Children Shut Out of the School Gates</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Our Guangzhou Correspondent, Liang Feng, Dated the 20th</p>
<p>Perhaps the destitution of the people is an unavoidable phenomenon in the aftermath of war! Everything in Guangzhou society is developing abnormally, morality is declining, and social customs are deteriorating, especially now. But to reverse this decline, to change this bad social atmosphere, and to reform the national mindset, the main thing is to start with education. Therefore, amidst the clamor for reconstruction on all fronts, the reconstruction of education is indeed a more urgent task.</p>
<p>Before the war, the educational standards of Guangzhou were considered the best in the country, but after eight years of resistance against Japan and the enemy's ravages, they have been steadily declining. Although the local education authorities have made their best efforts, due to subjective and objective conditions, this problem remains quite serious.</p>
<p>Indeed, anyone who tries to count the number of out-of-school youth and children will find the figure quite alarming. This reporter once visited the local education authorities to investigate, and although they gave the reply "not yet counted," one can get an approximate figure from a conversation the director of the Municipal Education Bureau had with this reporter. He said, "The number of out-of-school children in the city has not yet been counted. However, judging from the 970,000 population of this city announced by the Civil Affairs Bureau, children should account for at least one-fifth, which means there are at least 200,000 children. After deducting the 50,000 to 60,000 who cannot attend school due to family financial difficulties or various other special reasons, there are at least 130,000 to 140,000 school-age children who need to attend school..." If we extrapolate according to his statement, how many school-age youth are there? In the population of 970,000, youth should account for two-fifths! That would be 380,000 youth. Even if we halve that due to various other special reasons, there are at least 190,000 youth of school age who need to attend school.</p>
<p>But how many schools have actually been restored? According to investigations, there are seven schools above the specialist college level in the city, excluding Sun Yat-sen University. When Guangzhou was recovered, there were only 22 secondary schools. This semester, this has increased to 38, just half of the pre-war total, and only three of these are municipal and only nine are provincial. If each of the above schools is estimated to have an average of seven or eight hundred students, the maximum number of students they can accommodate will not exceed 50,000. Thus, it can be calculated that there are 140,000 out-of-school youth!</p>
<p>As for primary schools, before the war, Guangzhou had 100 municipal primary schools and one kindergarten. But now only 42 primary schools and one kindergarten have been restored, accommodating a total of 15,650 children, according to the Education Bureau's announcement. Private primary schools have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. According to the person in charge of the Education Bureau (now merged into the Fourth Section of the Social Affairs Bureau) who told this reporter: there are currently 69 private primary schools. If each school is estimated to have an average of 500 students, their capacity is only over 30,000 people. Combining the municipal and private primary schools in the city, only 40,000 to 50,000 children are attending school. Thus, it can be calculated that there are approximately 80,000 children who are excluded from the school gates!</p>
<p>Moreover, because there are so few municipal schools, private schools are rising up at this opportune moment, raising tuition fees. Although the Education Bureau stipulates that private schools should charge no more than 20,000 yuan per semester for senior high school, 18,000 yuan for junior high school, and 7,500 yuan for primary school, in reality, no school fails to charge extra fees, and textbook fees and ordinary miscellaneous expenses are not small. At a time when prices are rising daily, there are too few municipal schools and private schools are unaffordable, so many are forced to remain out of school.</p>
<p>The cries of tens of thousands of parents, as twenty-odd thousand school-age youth and children linger outside the doors of education, have attracted the attention of all parties. The local education authorities also seem to feel the seriousness of the problem, but increasing the number of municipal schools this semester is merely a fantasy. Although there is also a Youth Guidance Office here to register out-of-school and unemployed youth and guide them back to school and employment, its strength is limited, and the problem cannot be fundamentally solved. As for the relief of out-of-school children, good news did once come. The Municipal Education Bureau announced that it had been approved to add 22 municipal primary schools this semester, to open as many classes as possible, and to accommodate a large number of children, and that existing schools would also increase classes. When the general public heard this news, everyone rejoiced. However, in the end, due to funding, school buildings, the reorganization of the Municipal Education Bureau, etc., they only received the replies "the decision to increase schools has been postponed" and "the method of increasing classes is still being formulated."</p>
<p>But time flies easily, and once it passes, you have to wait another semester or even a year. No matter how you shout, all you get is a difficult and impractical answer. Thinking of the future of education, a shadow is cast over everyone's heart.</p>
<p>The bustling streets of London, a hub of traffic.</p>
<h3>The British Government Focuses on Urban Construction: London, a Case of Top-Heaviness</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Our London Correspondent, Xue Yan, Dated the 15th</p>
<p>After the end of the war, Britain is now busy with construction. The first thing is to build Greater London. Although the UK has a population of just over 40 million, London alone has over 13 million, giving it a sense of top-heaviness. Before the war, Sir Patrick Abercrombie designed the construction of Greater London, dividing London into four rings, to disperse many factories to the suburbs, but this was suspended due to the outbreak of war. Now that the war has ended, this proposal has been revived, and some factories that moved to the suburbs to avoid bombing may not need to return. According to Minister of Town and Country Planning Silkin's announcement in the House of Commons on the 5th of this month, the London County Council has approved an appropriation of over 2.47 million pounds for construction. According to the plan for Greater London, London is divided into four rings: the Central Ring in the middle, followed by the Suburban Ring, then the Green Ring, and finally the Outer Country Ring. It is said that at least over one million people can move to the outer suburbs as a result.</p>
<p>Elections for the London County Council were held on March 8th, and the Labour Party won 90 seats, the Conservative Party 30 seats, the Liberal Party 2 seats, and the Communist Party 2 seats. Before the election, the Labour Party had 76 seats and the Conservative Party had 48. As a result of this election, the Conservative Party lost 18 seats and the Labour Party gained 14 seats, sufficient to indicate the popularity of the Labour Party.</p>
<p>Churchill's Speech: Startling Even to the Bold</p>
<p>At a time when both Britain and the United States were uncertain and wary of the Soviet Union, former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill gave his shocking speech at the University of Missouri in the United States on February 5th, which made people in Britain and the United States suddenly realize the depth of the conflict between the two sides. Many could not help but reflect, were they about to prepare for war again? The emotion Churchill represented in his speech was perhaps shared by people in both countries, but for someone of his political position and prestige to speak so boldly and straightforwardly was startling even to the boldest. Therefore, the reaction after the speech was great, and the opinions varied. Within Britain, it was especially complex due to party relations. The day after Churchill's speech, a well-known reporter for the left-leaning News Chronicle, Vernon-Barlett, said that to his knowledge, Churchill had not consulted the government authorities before giving the speech, but had sent a copy of the speech to the British Ambassador to the United States, Halifax. The next day (i.e., the third day after giving the speech, also February 7th), the Daily Herald, the organ of the British Labour Party, said in an editorial, "This newspaper can say with good authority that Churchill did not consult with the government authorities before giving the speech." But the Conservative Party's Daily Mail said on the same day that the content of Churchill's speech had been telegraphed to the government authorities by Halifax, and that there had been multiple exchanges of telegrams between the authorities and the embassy regarding this matter. It also said that when Churchill was drafting the speech, President Truman and Byrnes had the opportunity to read it and expressed their agreement.</p>
<p>From these many dispatches, we can see that Churchill did not consult the government authorities in advance for his speech, because he stated at the beginning of his speech that it only represented his personal opinion and did not carry any government status, so strictly speaking, there was no need to seek government consent. But no one denies that he sent a copy of the speech to the British Ambassador to the United States, and it is possible that the British Ambassador to the United States telegraphed the British Foreign Office. As for President Truman and Churchill agreeing all the way to Missouri and knowing its contents in advance, it is also reasonable. But we know that whether the British government authorities or the US government authorities knew the contents in advance is one thing, expressing approval or having the same opinion is another. Since Churchill stated that it was only his personal opinion and that he would bear all the responsibility himself, who can interfere with him in a country with freedom of speech, who can ask him to change his opinion? On the contrary, the great reaction it aroused in all aspects shows that he did represent the powerful opinions of a large part of the people. As for the attitude of the two governments, in other words, what should the attitude be from an official standpoint, they can use other methods to express it in the future. As of today, it seems that neither government feels the need to issue a special statement to clarify its attitude.</p>
<p>British Loan from Canada: $1.25 Billion</p>
<p>Britain has successfully borrowed $1.25 billion from Canada. The conditions are similar to the US loan, but part of it can only be used after the US loan is established. If the US loan does not pass in the US Congress, the two governments will discuss the steps to be taken separately. In addition, the interest-free loan that Britain borrowed from Canada in 1942 will be postponed to January 1951 before it begins to be repaid, with the same conditions as before. According to this loan, the total amount is 700 million yuan. After the same part is repaid, there is now 560 million yuan left.</p>
<p>The Australian government has reached an agreement with the British government to welcome British people to move to Australia. Any British people who have served in the military or merchant ships during the war can apply to move there, and the two governments will bear the cost of the tickets. Other people can also apply, and once approved, adults only pay 10 pounds for the ticket and children only pay 5 pounds. However, applicants who are willing to move must have the intention of residing in Australia for a long time. It is said that during the war, Britain moved 6,000 children to Australia for refuge, but later, according to a government survey, a large part of them were willing to return to Britain when they grew up.</p>
<p>The British Imperial Conference will be held in London after Easter, and the Australian Prime Minister will be coming to Britain soon. The main topic of the conference is said to be the issue of world trade. After the abolition of British imperial preferences and the sterling bloc, trade between the British Empire will naturally be greatly affected, and there is a need to discuss countermeasures together. In addition, food issues and imperial defense issues will also be put to discussion.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Anecdotes from the People's Political Council</h3>
<p>The press pass for the People's Political Council is much more elaborate than the one for the Political Consultative Conference. It is made of dark green cardboard, with the Secretariat's seal on the front and the Council's fire seal on the back. It was printed in Hankou for the first session of the first Council in 1938. The reporter's is number 7, which is coincidentally the same as the PCC's special number 7.</p>
<p>From the Second Plenary Session of the KMT to the People's Political Council, this reporter has been running to the Military Affairs Commission every day for a month. He is now very familiar with the geography of the venue and even the armed comrades guarding it.</p>
<p>The staff of the Secretariat of the People's Political Council were transferred to work for the Plenary Session during the Second Plenary Session of the KMT, and now they are back to work for the People's Political Council. All the equipment of the People's Political Council is the same as that used in the Second Plenary Session of the KMT. The street traffic station signs, the steamed buns and snacks during the break, and the stenographer in the black and red-edged cheongsam sitting in front of the stage are all the same as those at the Plenary Session. The only difference is that a temporary post and telegraph office has been added outside the venue.</p>
<p>Mo Dehui's graying short beard and Northeastern accent, Li Huang's briskness and competence, Wang Yunwu's "scientific management," Jiang Yong's spirit of the rule of law, and Wu Yifang's voice full of joys and sorrows all attract the attention of the entire audience. They presided over the conference separately, creating all kinds of different atmospheres.</p>
<p>At each conference, the first part of the report is mostly smooth and stable. Journalists listen without taking notes because the Central News Agency will issue a press release the next day, and it is mostly "historical documents" from not long ago. When the written inquiries are announced, the atmosphere begins to tense. During the oral inquiries, the entire venue is on high alert, as if facing a formidable enemy.</p>
<p>These few "anecdotes" were written when Shao Lizi and Zhang Qun were giving reports on the Political Consultative Conference and the cessation of conflict and reorganization, and were mailed from the conference post office.</p>

<h3>School Cannot Rent School Buildings: Female Students Sincerely Appeal</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Our school (Zhengzhong Girls' High School) was the most enthusiastic in doing underground work during the Anti-Japanese War. Therefore, the enemy often visited, inspected, and monitored us. Our teachers and students were arrested and imprisoned several times, endured all kinds of torture, and remained loyal until victory came. After the victory, the number of students increased a lot, so we requested the landlord of No. 2, Lane 15, Tika Road to rent it as a school building, but we were unsuccessful. At the beginning of this month, we learned that the house had been rented by an English woman named Mrs. Linden. Then, through mediation by the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Management Committee, the English woman signed in her own handwriting, agreeing to rent five rooms of the building to our school as a school building. However, to collect the rent, we had to pay six months of US dollars in advance, with a monthly rent of US$59. Our school's expenses have always been public. Each semester, we borrow in the millions, and we still have no way to repay the loans from previous years. How can we afford such a large rent? Therefore, the school authorities have pleaded with her several times, asking her to reduce the rent, but she not only ignored us, but also rented out our classrooms to others in violation of the contract, separating the field and hindering sports. The education of our hundreds of students is about to be interrupted. Therefore, the representatives of all the teachers and students in the school requested that she return the classrooms, but the English woman stubbornly refused to comply. Our students are restless and uneasy, so we sincerely ask for a corner of your newspaper to publish our appeal and ask the elders and seniors of society to uphold justice. (Chen Kunying, March 23rd.)</p>

<h3>Inaugural Statement</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition, prepared for four months by colleagues from the Chinese Society of Technicals, is roughly complete in scale, and we are finally very happy to meet with all our dear compatriots.</p>
<p>Although the exhibition has only been open for three days so far, and although its content is far inferior to the exhibitions held in various places in advanced European and American countries, seeing the endless stream of visitors and hearing more praise than criticism, this sensational scene really makes people think deeply!</p>
<p>Originally, in China's nearly 100-year history of industry, national industries have always played a supporting role. The eight-year Anti-Japanese War did not make our national industries rise to a dominant position. Even the industrial sectors that were rebuilt in the vast areas of the rear were depressed due to the arrival of victory, let alone the industries that were devastated in the occupied areas! However, the wheels of history are always moving forward, and China is bound to industrialize. If it does not, China cannot complete the great cause of national construction.</p>
<p>Looking at the reality, the staff in our technical field feel that we should make a call for rapid national industrialization here in Shanghai, a place that can represent Chinese industry. Therefore, under the auspices of the Chinese Society of Technicals, we have held this first "Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition." We have no extravagant expectations, but only want to take this opportunity to fulfill our initial wish of "exhibiting industrial products, promoting national construction, popularizing scientific knowledge, and promoting technical education." If someone can change their vision as a result and invest their funds in industrial construction or technical education, then the "Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition" will have completed its mission.</p>
<p>During this exhibition, many guests told us that on the one hand, they felt that China's industrial construction was just beginning to flourish, and whether it was light industry or heavy industry, it was far behind; on the other hand, they felt that there were indeed many problems with China's industrial technology. However, our colleagues in the Chinese Society of Technicals believe that as long as politics are clear, national strength will naturally be abundant, the economy will be consolidated, and the technical level of the people will inevitably be improved.</p>
<p>We, the colleagues in the Chinese Society of Technicals, also vow to promote the progress of technology with the unique vigor and vitality of young people!</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to give the people of Shanghai a deeper understanding, we have specially taken a corner of Shen Bao as a special issue of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition. In this small space, we will give the people of the country a deeper introduction to this Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition and the sponsoring Chinese Society of Technicals. We also hope to take this opportunity to get more sympathy and guidance from seniors and advanced people at home and abroad, and from friends everywhere, whether we know them or not, whether they can visit the exhibition or not!</p>
<h3>Future Efforts of the Chinese Technical Association</h3>
<p>— Wang Tianyi</p>
<p>After a full four months of preparation, the members of the Chinese Technical Association have finally presented the inaugural Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition to the nation. Since the results of this exhibition are fairly satisfactory, and its significance is understood and accepted by those concerned with the construction of the new China, people cannot help but have deeper concern for the Chinese Technical Association, which organized this exhibition. In the exhibition hall, many technicians and vocational youth requested to join the association. Although there has been considerable introduction in the special edition of the industrial exhibition, verbose elaboration is not something we admire. Here, we only wish to use the medium of the newspaper to give a general response to friends across the country.</p>
<p>Our purpose, according to Article 2 of the charter, is: "To unite technical personnel nationwide, dedicate ourselves to national construction, popularize technical education, promote academic research, and seek common welfare." What can be stated here is that there are a total of over 400 technical personnel from the chemical, electrical, mechanical, civil engineering, textile, agricultural, commercial, mining and metallurgy, and mathematical and physical departments who have joined the Technical Association as members. In this exhibition, there are nearly a hundred more who have applied to join. In addition, during the preparation period, we have received responses and participation from technical personnel in Chongqing, Kunming, and other places. Many members who joined in Shanghai have gone to work in Taiwan and other coastal ports due to job transfers. It is expected that in the near future, branches of the Technical Association in the aforementioned areas can be formed. We very much hope that friends in other regions who sympathize with the work of the Technical Association will contact us, gradually establish branches, and build a strong and solid national technical personnel organization.</p>
<p>Regarding dedicating ourselves to national construction, we believe this is the aspiration and ideal of every technical person. It is a personal disgrace and a national loss for Chinese technical personnel not to contribute to the construction of the new China. Therefore, the members of the Technical Association are all eagerly looking forward to the early start of a large and practical national economic construction plan. Our members will thus each have the opportunity to "contribute to the country with their skills." The gradual depletion of national strength and the unbearable living conditions of the people are the main reasons.</p>
<p>Popularizing technical education is a direction that the Technical Association and its predecessor, the "Workers' Leisure Association," have been working hard on, because this is the work that technical personnel can strive for at any time and place, standing in their own positions. In view of the enormity of the national construction system and the shortage of technical cadres, we have worked hard in this way in the past, and we will continue to do so in the future. The *Engineering World* magazine will continue to be published regardless of the high cost of paper and printing. The third Industrial Lecture series is an event scheduled by the Technical Association for April. The Chinese Technical Vocational Night School has been encouraged by the society because of this exhibition, and plans to enrich its content and expand its scale. In addition, the "Technical Association" also wants to publish one or two sets of popular technical books, if the publishing industry is willing to cooperate.</p>
<p>Speaking of academic research, this is where the members of the Technical Association feel relatively ashamed. Apart from the personal achievements and efforts of a few members, generally speaking, the members of the Technical Association are now overemphasizing service work and inevitably neglecting their own self-improvement. This needs to be overcome. In the future, in addition to lectures and publications for the society, we will also hold academic lecture meetings and build libraries for ourselves. We also plan to establish contact with academic institutions and organizations in various countries to exchange publications and collect data.</p>
<p>Regarding hopes for the Technical Association, many members have mentioned welfare work. Today, at a time when industry is stagnant and prices are high, the treatment of technical personnel is generally low due to various factors. We cannot therefore not make some plans for our own lives and status. The planned items include job placement and consumer cooperation. For these, we especially hope for the cooperation and assistance of the industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<p>If the construction of the new China can be completed smoothly, it must be the result of sincere cooperation and persistent efforts from all levels of society. The colleagues of the Technical Association have worked hard for more than two years in difficult times. This effort has been proven by the facts to have not been wasted. It is believed that the future work will also be able to achieve the due effect.</p>
<p>At the founding meeting, Mr. Zhao Zukang and Mr. Zhao Zengjue, representing the engineering community, and Mr. Cao Liangxia and Mr. He Shangping, representing the scientific community, all believed that the Chinese Technical Association would become one of the three pillars of national construction together with the China Science Society and the Chinese Institute of Engineers. This is indeed an overestimation. Mr. Hu Juewen and Mr. Hu Xiyuan of the National Industrial Association especially hoped that the members of the Technical Association would maintain close contact with the industrial community. This is also a kind intention. We are not worthy of it, but we very much want to do so. We especially respect the achievements of senior scholars, advanced organizations, and progressive national industrialists, and hope that under their guidance and sponsorship, we can develop the strength of technical personnel and realize the ideals of technical personnel with each passing day.</p>
<p>The opening of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition has undoubtedly taken the Technical Association one step further. We firmly believe that since we have goals and are willing to work hard, our organization will inevitably move forward day by day, and our work will inevitably gain the sympathy and support of people across the country. Reaching a prosperous and happy new China, this journey is not far away.</p>
<h3>A Flood of Comments</h3>
<p>"Technical education is the most important task for national construction in the future. The Chinese Technical Association, advancing under this banner, should not be complacent with past achievements, but should continue to work hard."</p>
<p>"The staff is indeed enthusiastic and numerous. If more effort could be put into instructional explanations, the visitors would surely gain more!"</p>
<p>"Many small industries have indeed progressed compared to eight years ago. It can be said that while the war destroyed some industries, it also established some. Relatively speaking, industry has lifted its head a bit. However, will this lifted head of industry continue to develop in the future to achieve the goal of building the country through industry? Or will it shrink and become a flash in the pan? This is a very important question, and it is precisely what the industrial community is most worried about at present."</p>
<p>"China must industrialize after the war. After visiting the exhibition now, I feel that the people of the country are striving to improve, which is very gratifying."</p>
<p>"We need such industrial product exhibitions to instill industrial knowledge in the general public, especially children."</p>
<p>"It is hoped that this Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition hosted by the Chinese Technical Association will not only provide the participating factories with an opportunity to promote their business and conduct research and observation on each other's products, but also provide the manufacturers with an opportunity to communicate with each other, unite and organize, so that China's national industrialists can be organized and embark on the road of truly promoting China's industrialization movement."</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly, in a China where industry is declining after the war, the industrial product exhibition does give people a new inspiration."</p>

<h3>List of Manufacturers Donating Items for Charity Sale to Raise Funds for Chinese Technical Education</h3>
<p>Our association has set up a charity sale at the exhibition to raise funds for Chinese technical education. We are extremely grateful to all the manufacturers for their enthusiastic donations. We hereby list the names of the donating manufacturers to express our gratitude. However, there are still four days left in the exhibition. Due to the large number of visitors in recent days, there are still not enough items for charity sale. We dare to appeal to manufacturers throughout the city to continue to donate. All company names will be published in the newspaper later, and the donated items will be announced in the venue. We hope that all manufacturers will generously assist us.</p>
