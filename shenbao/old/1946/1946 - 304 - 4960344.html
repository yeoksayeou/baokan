<p>社論</p>
<h3>祝壽與報國</h3>
<p>今天是中華民國主席　蔣公六秩壽誕，全國同胞普徧慶祝，無分遐邇，發自眞誠。雖主席盛德謙光，切誡舖張，而各地民衆，本於崇德報功之一念，或醵金獻校，或致頌晋觴，事非尋常，情允難已。這實在因爲主席之一生，獻身革命，功在國家，今當大戰勝利之後，適逢元首周甲之年，祝主席壽者，即所以爲國家慶，亦即所以爲人民慶。主席所貢獻於國家與人民者無限，而人民果將何以報主席？故今日之祝壽，主席愈謙讓，人民愈愛戴。我們幾乎可以說：今天人民的祝壽，就是人民發揮報國情緒的象徵。</p>
<p>說到報國，那就是主席一生的志願。我們記得主席五十壽辰曾經發表過「報國與思親」的宏文，眞使人人讀了感動，聞風興起。現値六十華誕，主席前天通電又說，「今日國家尙未久安，同胞正深痛苦，」而他更極端自謙地表示，「正以未盡保國救民之職責，深爲疚愧。」我們回想起來，主席自十九歲留學時起，就立志追隨國父，致力國民革命，迄於今日，精神矍鑠，領導奮鬬，六十年中，除了少年時期而外，至少已爲國家効力了四十年，却還時時以「報國救民」爲念，以「國未久安，民正痛苦」爲慮，這種公爾忘私的報國精神，正是我們每一個黃帝子孫所當拳拳服膺，孳孳效法的。今天我們人民雖儘用一切方式恭祝主席的大　，實在抵不到主席報國精神於萬一；而我們人民也決不能僅止於祝壽，却遺忘了報國。因爲報國是人人的本分，而亦惟有人人切實報國，纔可以慰主席的素願，報主席的功德。</p>
<p>主席六十年的光陰，四十年貢獻於國家；而他四十十年的報國歷史，前半是服從國父的領導，忠於職守，後半是繼承國父的遺志，完成大業。我們今天爲主席祝壽，更爲中國祈福。中國不幸而有滿淸末葉百年的雙重恥辱，但中國亦何幸而前有國父，後有主席，爲國家民族的救星！我們試想；中國若無國父，何能有帝制的推翻，民國的創造？中國若無主席，何能有北伐的成功，抗戰的勝利？不有前者，無以啓後；不有後者，無以光前。今天我們恭祝　主席的大壽，更當爲中國大大地慶祝，——慶祝天佑中國，誕生偉人。</p>
<p>但是我們僅僅口頭祝壽，僅僅文字祈福，是不够的，是不足以表示崇德報功於萬一的。我們必須自己貢獻扌力，隨分報國，以分主席的憂，分主席的勞，這纔眞是爲主席祝壽，爲國家祈福的最好方法。因爲主席究竟花甲一周了，他已盡了四十年報國的責任了，革命抗戰的重擔由他蹈着、國父的蹤跡而負荷起來，也已有了二十年的漫長歲月了；固然，主席康强矍鑠，領導建國，羣倫宗仰，但主席總時時刻刻盼望着民國眞正能够建設起來，人民眞正能够自己來做國家的主人，使他所「保」之國成爲「久安」之「民國」，使他所「救」之民成爲沒有「痛苦」而能自治的「國民」。美國有華盛頓而國家剏造，有林肯而國家統一，華盛頓林肯兩大偉人固千古不朽，而美國人民亦享無窮的幸福。我們旣幸有國父孫公而國家肇造，亦願仰賴主席蔣公而國家統一。主席所夙夜蘄望的，就是有這麼一天，他能够看見他所辛苦救護的國家，得由訓政而入於憲政，由黨治而進於民治，由他的雙手，代表中國國民黨以還政於全國的人民。二十年前，中國人民需要主席的領導，主席當仁不讓，已經毅然領導着人民，初則北伐，完成了統一，繼則抗戰，保障了獨立，現在我們還是仰望着主席的領導，他也一定領導着我們完成和平統一與民主的建國工作。不過我們猜想主席的心目中，也許以爲在訓政時期，他不能不根據黨的三民主義來領導人民，而在憲政時期，他却期望着信仰三民主義的人民大家自己來領導着國家走上建設的大道。我們必須知道，民主政治的成功，决不能靠一個人的力量，而實有賴於全體人民至少是多數人民的合作力量。主席深知民主的精義在此故期望於人民者允切。今天我們人民隨分報國的方法，也就是仰答主席功德的方法，無他，只要大家各盡其力，充分合作，以完成和平統一的工作，以建立三民主義的政治制度與經濟制度，使中華民國確實成爲一個民有民治民享的現代民主的國家而已。</p>
<p>我們爲主席分擔憂勞，而不爲主席增加憂勞，纔算眞爲主席祝壽。維其如此，我們必須隨分努力，學習做一個民主國家的國民，人人貢獻扌力來報國，纔可以爲　主席分憂分勞，使主席上壽期願，眼見一個民主統一而強大的新中國，堅强的起來，擔負着保障世界和平維護人類正義的大責重任。</p>
<p>恭祝　主席的康强幸福！祈求國家的和平統一！</p>

<h3>莫洛托夫向聯大建議　世界普遍裁減軍備　禁止原子能使用於戰爭</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿九日電〕蘇聯外長莫洛托夫今夜在聯合國大會演說，歷一小時又八分鐘，前段闡明蘇聯遠大外交政策，　即出其不意，轉取外交攻勢，提出四點決議，以增強世界之和年，（一）聯合國全體大會認爲普遍裁減軍備，乃屬必要，（二）第一項任務爲禁止原子能供戰爭之用而生產，（三）全體大會向安理會建議在該方面採取切實措施，（四）全體大會　請各國政府支持此等措施。莫氏演講，以法語翻譯畢，許多代表均已離場，莫氏要求對裁減軍備之決議案開始辯論，經英代表培克建議於綜合委會研究此一問題後再議，莫氏當表首肯。大會乃宣告休會至明日再開。</p>
<p>〔聯合社廿九日電〕莫洛托夫今夜在聯大會演說，措辭露骨，首謂五大國所享有之否決權如予以嚴止，則聯合國機構必隨之瓦解。莫氏繼乃抨擊邱吉爾及聯合國機構原子能管制委會業代表巴魯克，旋提議發起世界各國裁減軍備運動，要求調查聯合國尤其是美英兩國軍隊駐在非敵性國人數，並聲明願將蘇聯此種軍隊提供詳盡報告。莫氏演說時，會場人滿爲患，成思傾聽，田　提出普遍裁軍計劃，即報以熱烈掌聲。莫氏稱，邱吉爾及其英美方面許多朋友正在經營一種反蘇運動，以冀造成國際獨霸之局。巴魯克所提出之原子能管制方案，無非爲自身設想。</p>
<p>莫氏指安理會對於西班牙及伊朗案之決議，爲一大錯誤，並　當今世界現有兩種政治趨勢在衝突中，一即爲全體同意之和平而合作，一即控制他國。蘇聯則一向忠於國際合作。堅決尊重聯合國機構，認爲聯合國憲章必須忠誠履行，始終不渝。莫氏評論美艦隊最近訪問地中海一事，謂軍艦飛機有時開到某前所未到之處，以爲此乃堅強其外交手段所必需。原子彈則僅落於長崎廣島，尚未在他處一試，惟原子彈亦必能在他國發現，則一切幻想即告幻滅。</p>
<p>莫氏並指責原子外交之外，尚有金元外交及金鎊外交，企圖以此操縱他國。某某方面之計謀中則以原子彈佔據大部份關係，惟史達林元帥業已說過，原子彈秘密不能常保，原子彈亦不能解決一切。所惜邱吉爾輩，以其素抱反動思想，仍唯武力及控制自信。吾人如能領悟戰爭教訓，則必須共同爲對付侵略者而努力，聯合國機構必須使之成爲大國可以團結一致以對付任何侵略。安理會中大國須團結一致，已爲聯合國機構所承認，安可對此原則加以損毀。</p>
<p>〔合眾社紐約弗魯辛廿九日電〕聯合國原子能委會美代表巴魯克今日談稱，美準備接受莫洛托夫主張廢止原子彈及毀滅現有存貨之計劃，同時美政府方面指出莫洛托夫之解除世界軍備建議，在原則上爲值得歡迎而且動聽。但巴氏國美國必先知道其他各國禁止製造原子彈，且美國在實行解除軍備以前，願知蘇聯計劃之詳情。政府方面人士指稱：彼等　願將莫洛托夫之建議，留待聯合國美代表奧斯汀答復，但謂美國要求並致力於軍縮　十年如一日。</p>
<h3>美在華駐軍　係獲我同意　我代表團發表聲明</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山卅日廣播：出席聯合國大會之中國代表團，今日支持美國反對白俄羅斯所提之控訴，即美國陸戰隊之留駐中國，係違背聯合國憲章。白俄羅斯之控訴係在聯合國全體大會提出。中國代表團在聲明中稱：「中國對於白俄羅斯代表團之見解，完全不能同意。全世界均知美軍之留駐中國，係由中國同意，其任務係在解除日軍武裝與遣返日本在華軍民。此項任務在中國各部逐步完成，美國軍隊亦在逐步減少撤回本國，僅有少數仍在中國。美國軍隊從未參加國軍與共軍間之任何衝突，反之，美國駐華代表正努力促成政治困難之和平解決，此點中國必須予以體會。此等困難係由中國共黨反對政府統一國家之政策，並欲藉武力擴充其政治制　之範圍，以謀控制全中國」。</p>
<h3>民族和諧　世界大同　中國家庭制可資借鏡　郭泰祺在美廣播演說</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿九日專電〕我出席聯大代表第二位代表郭泰祺，頃在由三百五十餘台轉播之互助廣播公司，向美國人民廣播，要求世界各國採用中國家庭統一之傳統觀念，以發展中國一家之和諧精神。郭氏爲聯大五強國家代表特約演說者之第二人，此　演說之第一人爲美代表團之羅斯福夫人。廣播開始時，先由美空軍樂隊奏中國國歌，嗣即由郭氏演說，彼稱，中國家庭傳統觀念，以五世同堂爲理想，雖然有不可避免之摩擦，但和諧仍可維持，此種爲諸國家所發展之和諧之家庭精神，定能保證世界各民族共同向聯合國同一目的前進。此目的即戴明於聯合國憲章之原則及宗旨中。</p>
<h3>對外蒙要求　英不予支持</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿九日電〕關於外蒙總理兼外長卓爾巴桑，最近致函四國外長會議秘書處，要求參加遠東委會一事，頃據英外部宣佈，英政府對於此項要求，殆難予以支持。</p>
<h3>英艦侵犯領海</h3>
<p>阿爾巴尼亞提申訴</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦卅日廣播：阿爾巴尼亞代表今向聯大會申訴，謂英兵艦二艘曾於十月廿二日侵入阿國境內，含有威脅性質。</p>
<h3>五強否決權問題　仍爲聯大會辯論中心　美國代表團擬具限制方案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山三十日廣播：聯大會今日進入第二週，討論中心，仍爲否決權問題，莫洛托夫　請各國減縮軍備之建議，並不減少各代表對否決權之辯論。截至今日爲止，在五十一國代表中，已有廿九國向大會致詞，而其中曾討論否決權者則有廿三國（包括五強中之四強，）抨擊否決權之小國共十三國之多，各該代表要求限制或完全取消否決權則之引用，至於反對變更否決權者則有英·法·中·蘇·白俄羅斯·波蘭·捷克·加拿大·敘里亞九國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿九日電〕美國爲避免被認爲與英國結夥對付蘇聯起見，正草擬限制五大國在安理會運用否決權之詳細方案，其要點如下：（一）擴大現有議事規則，不准五常任理事國中任何一國參加安理會對該國本身有關控案之判決。（二）准許五國中任何一國自動放棄表決權，而不作行使否決權論。（三）充分劃分安理會所討論之手續問題。（僅須過半數表決）及實質問題（須五常任理事國全體同意表決）。此項方案如不能獲得協議，則勢將引起安理會長時期激烈辯論。</p>
<p>惟此項計劃雖尚待最後一分鐘之修正，惟聞即可非正式向此間中蘇英法四國提出。徵求意見，然後提付聯合大會小組會討論。美首席代表奧斯汀明日在大會發表演說時，將正式提出上項計劃，奧斯汀演說並將避免政治問題，僅以聯合國份內事爲限。</p>
<h3>世界糧食籌委會　我代表發表演說</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦三十日電〕史達林昨日發表談話，否認邱吉爾所謂蘇聯在歐駐軍一百師之說，並謂蘇聯在各該國僅駐軍六十師。「每日電聞」報外交記者本日加以評論稱，史達林元帥所謂六十師，每師或包括五萬員名，則總數將達三百萬員名。至於邱吉爾估計二百師，每師僅包括一萬員名，則總數不過二百萬員名。此種結論，證明該問題之困難，官方所以表示誠狀，其故在此。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾答覆史達林　願英蘇釋嫌修好　希望披露軍額祛除羣疑</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿九日電〕前首相邱吉爾今晚發表聲明，嚴斥史達林元帥所謂蘇聯在歐洲僅有駐軍六十師之說，謂此數「並不包括羅馬尼亞，當然亦不包括集中於列甯格勒及奧迪　之重兵」。但兩小後，邱氏又將此句刪去，並未說明理由。邱氏此舉，顯因並未閱及史氏談話全文，因史氏所指六十師駐在外國之軍隊，實包括羅馬尼亞在內。邱氏此次聲明，語氣溫和，爲渠以前歷次對蘇言論所罕見。據稱，余聽到史氏關於蘇軍之聲明，甚爲欣慰·一九四一年余在首相任內締結之英蘇條約，曾規定互不干涉對方內政及社會制度，故余不知吾人何以不能成爲友人互相援助，提高每一地方廣大羣眾之整個生活標準。余於史氏表示尊敬，並願蘇聯人民安全光榮與快樂。至余所謂蘇聯在各佔領區駐軍有兩百師之說，英政府並未加以更正。吾人已飽嘗種種猜疑，而消釋猜疑之道莫過於事實。聯合國機構與安理會應有機會充分並公正披露全部軍隊以釋羣疑云。</p>
<h3>美認史達林談話　促進諒解新因素</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓廿九日電〕今日貝爾納斯與杜魯門總統會商幾達一小時，但並未說明彼等曾否討論史達林之書內談話·同時世界各國領袖，包括杜魯門總統在內，對於史達林之答覆，均曾予以密切研究，今夜即有史達林答記者問之稿件一份送呈杜魯門，總統以極大興趣予以閱讀。國務院方面人士稱，史達林對合眾社經理貝利提出之問題所作答覆，顯示蘇聯可能於不久將來，與英美協同成立德國之經濟統一，而繼之以成立德國臨時政府。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕國務院今日評論史達林元帥昨日之談話，謂史氏希望德國統一，並望成立滿意的和約，實係響應國務卿貝爾納斯。史氏重新注意向美借款，則已引起相當驚異。國務院方面原以爲蘇聯對於其一年前提十億美元之借款談判已不復關切，今始知其不然。貝爾納斯對於史氏談話，未直接表示意見，甚至對於史氏反駁貝氏所謂美蘇關係日趨緊張一點，亦不加批評。</p>
<p>〔合眾社東京三十日電〕麥帥艾其森及特萊夫揚柯中將均曾以極大興趣閱讀史達林之書面談話，但拒絕正式予以評論。麥帥總部高級官吏則非正式表示意見云：英美與蘇聯間重大異議之解決，可對亞洲之局部問題發生良好影響，包括朝鮮問題在內，該方面美蘇關係最爲緊張。</p>
<h3>適應現代國防需要　法改良軍訓制度　受訓期增爲四年舉國可成精兵</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿九日電〕法陸軍部發言人告記者稱：未來之法國將處於極完善軍事準備狀態之下，強迫軍訓制雖受小額預算之限制，然施行六月以來，成績已極滿意。戰前之制度，使習於平民生活者，未有準備，突然須受一年軍訓。新制度訓練期擴爲四年，本於戰時所獲之教訓，使其大爲改進，而與平民生活保持密切之交織，故他日若再發生戰爭，老百姓均可充分幫助作戰。二次世界大戰中，正規軍不能阻止德國機械化部隊之推進，但游擊戰却能發揮極大效能。他日戰爭中若果使用原子新武器，則游擊戰將有更廣大之應用。德國新軍訓制度分爲兩期：第一期爲三年預備軍訓，凡年在十七與廿歲間之法國青年，均須在本地受訓。最初二年由陸軍部及教育部共同監督主重體格訓練·第三年則由陸軍部單獨監督，使訓練計劃完全軍事化。三年初訓期畢舉行考試，核定成績。至第四年，乃進入積極軍事訓練期。已完畢初訓之青年，依其年級召集，根據美陸軍軍訓制度，給予體格及心理上之試驗，然後依其成績，分班送入軍事訓練中心受訓一年·在第一個半年內，施以普通軍事科學之基本訓練，至第二個半年內，則被派至陸軍之各特種部分，如傘兵，坦克，砲兵，及供應等部隊，施以特種訓練，至訓練完畢，准其恢復平民生活，作爲後備，若成績優良者，則可入軍官學校繼續深造。凡列入後備极者，每隔數年當施以復訓一次，使其不忘已獲之軍事常識，並灌輸最近代化之軍事學識。</p>
<h3>蘇門答臘華僑　遭印尼人慘殺</h3>
<p>衝突結果死傷甚多</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴達維亞廿九日電〕蘇門答臘華僑本年九月間因拒懸印尼國旗，與印尼人發生衝突，華僑死傷頗多。據印尼人士談稱：華僑死傷遠較印尼人爲多。麻剌甲海峽對岸之兩頭，於九月十八日發生衝突，致有印尼人二百十八名殞命，華僑死傷當不止此數。</p>

<h3>六根痛陳徒孫罪惡　靜安寺有秘密機關　出資菩薩　趕掉弱小　結交日人　德悟密迦兩僧供因結怨被控</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕靜安寺住持德悟，監院密迦漢訐嫌疑案，昨晨九時半在高院刑二庭開　，旁聽者甚眾，其中穿緇衣者三四十人，法庭上光頭擠擠，另有一番氣象。檢舉人六根·仰西·及謝錫卿三人皆到庭供述一切，兩被告亦有抗辯，審訊至十二時一刻始畢，庭諭尚需調查證據，改期再訊，被告還押。</p>
<p>德悟供稱：廿七歲，上海人，七歲出家，卅年七月因師父志汶圓寂，乃繼承方丈·六根爲我師公。係在民國十二年時爲齊　元韓國鈞所撤職。仰西則在我師父主特時，担任監督，後因與我師父打官司，始爲地方法院判決撤銷監督名義。密迦則原爲寗波白衣寺住持，後因避難來滬，住在靜安寺。我請來做監院，另謝錫鄉原爲靜安寺門前時光書店老　，所租房屋係屬廟產，因建造山門，又因契約已滿，故付與搬場費三百萬元，不予續租，此次被控或結怨於此。</p>
<p>繼提密迦上堂。答辯大多與德悟所供者相同。</p>
<p>三檢舉人　陳訴罪狀</p>
<p>庭上繼詢檢舉人六根，身衣破舊僧衣，供稱：六十二歲，本地人，九歲進靜安寺，原爲住持，民國十二年起不做，待密迦進來，且將我趕出。德悟爲我徒孫。庭上問以爲何告發密迦，答稱：因係漢奸。密迦曾任偽佛教會常務理事，且創辦同朋日語學校，又將廟內老弱幼小和尚趕掉，將岳飛彌陀等菩薩搬出賣錢。靜安寺裏還有秘密機關，電話警鈴等齊備。東洋人及東洋女人等進出很多，聲勢浩大，密迦對東洋人好，對自己人刻薄。</p>
<p>仰西亦衣黯舊僧衣，供稱：六十七歲，安徽人，前在靜安寺任監督。檢舉原因爲德悟密迦等覇佔廟產，結交日儈藤井靜宜，木下萬溪等，合辦日語夜校。又利用偽彿教會勢力，加以壓迫，驅逐我出境，欲置之死地。</p>
<p>謝錫卿稱：原開書店。檢舉原因係被告等與日僧合辦同朋日語夜校，向敵大使館備案。教本由日本及偽滿運來。又參加大東亞慰靈法會，担任籌備委員及超度法師，有事後與敵軍官合攝之照片及報紙記載爲體云。</p>

<p>壽堂，由寗波同鄉會理盡事負責佈置，在前天晚上已經油漆一新，昨天下午已全部佈置完畢。大門口高高地紮起了一座紅綠彩牌，在二樓陽台前懸着「上海市各界慶祝主席蔣公垂誕大會」的一幅金字橫額，尤其引人注目的是門首兩旁用紅綢圍成的二個大柱子。一踏進禮堂就覺得自己被包圍在紅色的喜氣洋洋的圈子裏。四週壁上，以及每一根柱子上都紮滿了紅釭綠綠的布幔，有國徽樣的，有壽字樣的，以及各式各樣的花式。四壁更掛着各式燈籠二十隻。半空中還用粉紅，淡綠，玫瑰紅，淡藍的綢條，交叉的懸掛着。在充滿了中國情調的色彩中，每一件小小的擺設，都含着「喜」的意義壽台正壁懸掛了贈獻主席的大幅紅緞巨幕上繡麒麟及花朶，兩側兩幅幕上繡着金魚。幕前設一霓紅燈，大桃子中有一紅「壽」字。壽桌前上面懸紫紅色綢，上有「萬壽無疆」四金字。</p>
<p>那隻壽桌才有趣吶！完全採用寗波風格，富麗堂皇，五花八門。第一排是四隻錫器，一隻燭台，二隻香台，後面搭着高約三尺的五彩霓虹燈小牌樓一座。長方桌兩旁是七對壽燭，這是寗波習俗預祝七秩的意思。插燭錫台也是各種不同，有鶴，鹿，和合，五福通壽。台上排列着的還有翡翠玉如意一座；糕，桃，燭，麵，四盤裝得像大錐子一般。另有紅賀玻璃一對，銀三星上壽，八仙慶壽，周鼎，商鼎，彝，盉，及敦五　銅器。壽茶六杯，內裝桂圓，黑棗，蓮子各兩杯；此外還有彩花壽燭一對。今天台上九對壽燭由各界祝壽籌備會備就，一對最大的裝花壽燭有十斤多重，是源豐順燭店所贈。</p>
<p>寗波同鄉會禮堂既改名「中正廳」，今日祝壽第一項節目因此是「中正廳」揭幕禮。這塊金字匾額是七十歲的前清舉人張傳保所書。在未揭幕前，匾上蓋着黃紅綢簾，吊着九根紅黃緞帶預備請吳市長，潘議長，徐副議長及六縣　宿（　縣童渭濱，慈谿秦潤卿，鎮海李詠裳，奉化孫鶴　，象山張介　，定海朱子奎）等九人揭幕用的。其中音　濱老先生今年已八十多歲了。</p>

<h3>棉商存底　竟不滿十萬担　彈花業存貨相當充足　棉紡精煉尚未完全申報</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕棉花商公會奉令調査所屬會員存棉數量；昨已辦理竣事。計來會登記之會員，共一百〇三家。登記存棉總量，爲九萬〇九百八十七担十一斤。據該公會負責人語記者：該項存量，僅及事變前之微數而已。據稱：該會所屬會員，共達一百四十七家。惟近月來有百分之十，聲請退會，現正由公會調査退會理由中。尙有百分之二三十，則無花經營，業務純處停頓狀態中。一般棉商，資力薄弱，不勝高利貸之壓迫。而採購國棉，又因交通困離，產地棉價過高，難以販運。對外棉則自本年五月央行停止供給外匯以來，早已停止訂購。故會員手中之存棉，已極有限。在此國棉登塲之際、亟望政府輔助採購，籍維紡織原料，而免浪費外滙。又該公會近査本市彈花業中，不乏經營原棉買賣業務者，且具相當規模之商號。其存棉量，且不在棉花商號之下。故爲顧全事實計，已勸請各該商號加入公會爲會員。據悉：現已調査竣事，擬請加入者，有隆興，裕大，金順興，新義興，龔義興，喬小毛，元隆、徐永年等八家。</p>
<p>又第六區棉紡公會辦理會員各廠存棉登記，迄昨日爲止，登記者尙僅半數，共的十餘家。擬候二三日內催報完竣後，再彙呈吳市長云。</p>

<h3>公債轉俏</h3>
<p>公債轉俏，雜牌尚平，統丙晨開一八三〇元，低價不過一入二〇元，即由八樓某戶及福源等購進，回升至一九五〇元左右，始轉盤局，結果較前收回升一〇〇元，甲乙丁戊亦帶起五〇元，成交的四五百萬元。</p>

<p>本市煤斤供應，需用浩繁，向　上海區燃料委員會統籌統配，　價格原分三類，公用事業，政　機關用煤，採用津貼辦法，由當局補助，故其配價原較工廠用煤低廉二倍之巨，茲該局業經經濟部核准，對以上二類用煤，配價定明日起實行調整，照原價提高一借，茲探得調整後之煤斤配價如次。</p>

<p>昨日烚赤，買氣奇盛，晨開二二八萬五左右，開後即自二二八萬一起，求過於供，不久即穿出二三〇萬大瀾，逐步盤好，十時後，央行以二三三萬二五之價，配給一〇〇條，此後買氣更熾，縱有供給，無甚影響，竟哄高到二三八萬以上，於是央行又有無限制供給之命，立吿回低，午刻在二三三萬內掙扎，午後人心仍倘，隔日交易仍回升至二三四萬以上，結果較前收漲起五萬二，銀樓飾金升爲念四萬八，紋銀未更，銀元微昂，暗拆銀根稍緊，暗息站一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣行動不便，僅稍見昂，美鈔門市仍以三五〇〇元買價，三五三〇元賣價，並無做開，暗市中的四二〇〇元左右，行動不便，結果僅吿微升，港票旣受金市刺激，加之申匯微縮，昨站定於九〇五左右，結果較前收升十元，港匯九〇五元，印匯一〇九五元，英匯一四四〇〇元，均有供給，成交不多，美匯牌價未更，對做却寂。</p>

<p>布市更見沉寂，成交之數，　寥無幾，形同停市，紡建多次開出，鮮有申請者，而民營廠製成品，亦堆積相當之多，如市面再不起色，廠商迫不得已，祇可　工以渡難關，昨日紡建開出細布龍頭，倒貼五百元至一千元，而竟無人承購，可見市塲淸淡之一斑，龍頭細布現貨入萬五千元，彩球細布開七萬九千元，其他各布，價無上落。</p>

<p>華股昨以便交消息刺激人心，晨開已露佳景，開後爭買，檯面異常涸竭，立吿轉昂，散戶心理過激，不久即漲起半成弱，高後轉呈拉鋸，銀行方面略有出龍，但人心奇佳，塲外買胃甚强，尙多回升，十時半後漸見力乏，美亞首先急降，永紗信和亦有乘機了結者，中途以廣帮等出後復進，雖低而多盤，後聞央行對黃金無限制供給之訊，人心又起恐慌，永紗立吿爭　，退至七一〇元以內，近午浮多恐慌，再退入七〇〇元大關內結束，較前收熱股計永紗信和景福新光勤興微升，美亞微挫，冷股除榮豐火柴五和景綸微降外，均尙見昂，午後交易更少，浮多較殷，以致供求稍以買者居多，平後盤好，臨收形勢較穩，但不脫盤旋，結果較前收計熱股以勤興信和各升半成光景，永紗美亞景福新光均吿微升，冷股以公司景綸五和火柴微挫，中紡內衣平平，餘者都吿微升，塲外各股尙形平定。</p>

<p>東華陣容，昨由隊長賈幼良公佈，張邦綸參加六分團征台，黃克厚傷足，均不克臨陣，門將乃改由劉顯漢担任，後衛李寗決出山助陣，前鋒綫上，老將戴麟經及孫錦順均重披征衣，其餘與戰龍傑時相同。</p>
<p>東華今日雖失去邦綸，及克厚二將，惟得劉顯漢司閣，可彌補後防之損失，前鋒獲孫老錦及阿戴之來歸，不但未見軟弱，抑且增強不少，中鋒阿載輔以孫錦順與韓龍海之內鋒，益以李垚及賈幼良之兩翼，乃爲東華最理想之前鋒配備，預卜攻勢必盛。</p>

<h3>英大新校長　楊公達先生會見記</h3>
<p>— 蔣風</p>
<p>在一個秋風秋雨的早晨，記者帶着傘，偕同英大農經學會負責人江君，往訪新校長楊公達先生·由於江君的指導，我們很快的便到達八角庫頭的楊校長公館門前。</p>
<p>叩門進去，是一座教會裏的舊式小洋房，佈置得很潔淨。進門以後，便有楊校長的隨員匆匆地由樓上下來，招待我們在一間簡樸而未佈置的會客室坐下。那位隨員就告訴我們，說楊校長身體不適，躺在床上，但是江君要求一見楊校長，請其代爲轉達來意，於是那位隨員便又匆匆上樓去了。</p>
<p>我們在會客室靜坐片刻，隨員下樓，帶着一支鉛筆，一片白紙，要我們寫上了自己的名字，再度上樓。我們便靜坐在會客室裏，呆望窗外霏霏的秋雨。</p>
<p>一位慈祥長者　良久，樓梯上起着響聲，我們便看到身材魁梧的楊校長緩步下樓。楊校長穿着一身戴青的西裝，架上一副深度的近視眼鏡，帶給我第一個印象，便覺得是一位慈祥的長者！</p>
<p>首先由江君提出請求學校當局向教育部交涉恢復農業經濟系招生的事宜，楊校長很誠摯地表示：「恢復農經系招生，不但是農經系同學們的希望，也是全校同學的希望，更是我的希望。旣然是大家一致的希望，在校長的立塲，在學校的立塲，在農經系的立塲，都應該使農經系恢復招生，不應該使一個擁有農學院半數以上同學的學系松然中斷。不過如今旣然已經通知各考區暫停招生，那末就得向教部請求擴招，待明天與各教授交換意見後，再決定，可能的話，可以與文理學院同時再行招生的。」</p>
<p>因爲楊校長有些氣喘病，而且看到他身體有些不舒服，記者本想不再打擾他而即行辭出，但是楊校長却像家長對着自己的子女絮話家常一般的誠摯，因之就順便提出建設新英大的問題。</p>
<p>太太吃不起苦　「英大是一個成立在戰時的學校，在全國各大學中是歷史最短的一個。」楊校長不加思索的很快地接下去說：「而且金華這地方就太差了，這種是不可言喻的困難，比方請教授，教授自己答應來，他太太或者吃不起苦，於是怕來，因之連教授也不來了。這話我已在那天留校同學會歡迎茶會上提起過·現在的金華浙贛鐵路尚未通車，交通不便，誰也不高興來。所以，我到了上海，便自己設法借錢，買了一輛吉普卡，將來一有教授到諸塈站，只要一通知學校，我們便馬上可以派吉普卡去接他，同時我也希望再買一輛大卡車接送同學解決同學們的交通困難」</p>
<p>雖然，楊校長的談話聲浪是相當低微，但是他的談興却更高了，簡直使我們沒有插嘴的餘地。</p>
<p>協力向新生　「所以，我覺得要在金華這地方把英大辦好，最要者是在改善環境，慢慢地使它好起來，另一方面我們同學也應該警覺到不要也和過去一般處於不安定之中，我們應該協力使英大步向新生。」</p>
<p>經過了三十分鍾光景，楊校長正與我們娓娓地談着校事的當兒，英大工學院周院長來了，楊校長只是招呼他上樓稍坐，又在桌邊坐下還是與我們談着校中的許多事情。但是我們却覺得有些不好意思，便由江君再重複提出恢復農經系招生事作爲結束，怱怱地告辭了出來。</p>
<p>冒着雨，步向歸途，雖然仍是迷蒙的秋雨秋風，有些凉意，但在心中却蘊藏着一份愉快而溫暖的情緒。</p>

<h3>談「現代中國洋畫」</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>「現代」，　時髦的銜頭，加在中國洋畫上，着實有點不妥吧？洋畫在歐洲二十世紀以來，已經有了兩個重要的階段，第一個階段是後期印象派的賽尙（Cezanne），第二個階段就是卡卡索（Picasso）。他們之所以稱爲「現代一，是以賽尙作分水嶺，把過去陳舊的藝術理論全部推翻，而確確實實的創出了嶄新的「現代精神」。中國的洋畫則不然，究其歷史，洋畫之輸入，最早也不過是在元朝，天主敎傳入中國的時候，但，那時並沒人去學習和提倡，所以嚴格的說來應該是始自民國比較恰當。在這短短的卅多年中，加以政變與戰禍的影響，至使整個藝術運動無法展開，所謂「洋畫」者，因其工具須要仰仗洋貨，因此在這次世界大戰中一般從事硏究者就無由取得。於是在戰後的今日，洋畫僅僅餘下了幾粒火種，偶而看到一個半個展覽會，其作品要我們承認爲「現代」洋畫，我想誰都沒有這個膽量吧。</p>
<p>洋畫在西洋，本身具有攸久燦爛的歷史，幾經變遷始有今日的成就。當我國剛開始學習和提倡的時候，在歐洲畫壞已經被凶猛巨大的野獸羣盤踞了，接着上演的立體派，未來派，塔塔派都正在表現着精彩的節目。而我們的幾位開國元勳還在忠實的臨摹着人家舊雜誌上登載的畫片，直到幾位剪了辦子的留學生回來，於是才懂得洋畫A．B．C．。這才廢除了臨摹而從事寫生。不久，印象主義也被販賣回來，裸體寫生也上了畫面。究竟是印象主義適合於中國人的胃口嗎？還是中國留學生僅僅祗懂得印象主義？爲什麼印象主義的命運竟至延長到民國卅五年的今日？雖然在民國廿年左右上海有過「決瀾社」的組織，現代洋畫也經他們搖旗吶喊的推動了一下，但，始終沒有喚起一般人的注意，成了曇花一現而已。所以，照上述的這種狀態看來，我們不妨把「中國的洋畫」分爲幾個時期。民初至民十年爲搖籃時期。民十年至十五年算它是准印象主義時期。十五年至二十年是印象王義全盛時期。二十年至廿六是「現代中國洋畫」的萌芽時期。廿六年直至今日，可稱之爲印象主義的復員時期。所以在最嚴密的意味上，可說持着現代精神的現代中國洋畫還沒有誕生，正期待新進作家們去努力。</p>

<h3>屠格湼夫語綠</h3>
<p>我認爲一個有思想的人，沒有一個地方是荒凉的曠野。至少我盡我的能力不讓自己生銹，長靑苔，成爲時代的落伍者。</p>
<p>我覺得一個人知道他自己是個窮人並且說出來的，他的感情一定有一些特別——一定有一種驕氣。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　78</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我見這傢伙的舉動，並無惡意，也許道是應有的一種手續，於是把車子開動，逕直衝了進去。進甬道口的時候，這才突地起了一種自覺，自己吿訴自己，「這是虎口哪！」如今雖然衝進，正不知將來如何出來咧。想到這裏，手心也出了一些冷汗，心口有些寒懍懍地。</p>
<p>剛進甬道，忽然聽見有人高聲喝道，「慢些！」却是中國話。這聲高喝，把甬道振得回聲嗡嗡的，好像雷鳴一般，我一聽，當即把車子改慢速度，遲吞呑走着。一剎出了甬道，才見左手轉出一個號衣來，揮着手，一邊袴聲　氣說，一上哪兒去哪，這麽性急火燒着屁股啦？一一邊呌我們向左轉進；原來迎　是一堵鋼網牆，左手邊才是停車塲，另有圍牆，和柵欄。這才明自那個日本崗哨，叫我們略停，爲了要讓這個侉子打開柵欄，好進塲停車哩。</p>
<p>這停車塲還有幾十部各色汽車，分類停着。我於是把車子開到卡車一排停下。在停車的動作上，我同虎弟時時注意的四面八方情形，却是除了那個侉子外，連一個鬼影都看不見，好大一片廣塲，祇是靜悄悄地，而那侉子見我們進了停車塲之後，大約看見我們開的卡車，了不起也不過勤務下士之流，不大看得起，所以頭也不回，立刻走到牆根脚放的一把竹椅上坐下，拿起了一本破書，正式用起功來。</p>
<p>「辛苦哪您哪！」我們打量了一下四向，走到那袴子身邊的時候，他頭也懶得抬起來，祇口裏哼出了這句話。大約他對每個勤務朋友都是這麼照例的說着。</p>
<p>「辛苦、大家辛苦！」我把嗓音壓得低低的。「借光你哪，委員長不在這兒嗎？……我似是城裏趕來的，要報吿一件事例……！」這是我早準備了的一句話，一方面也是看見這傢伙、十分容易對付，才放膽問着。（通州吃公事飯的，稱殷逆是委員長。）</p>
<p>「得哪，得哪！」他實在捨不得那本破書，「哥兒們去歇歇罷，您想大帥這早就起來？……剛才上床哪！」他的眼睛一直沒　開那本書，看那樣子，覺得十分討厭我們打攪他。</p>
<p>「彭公案…嘻嘻！」虎弟對我霎了霎眼睛。北地的人，通常喜歡施公案彭公案一類讀物，講究江湖義氣。</p>
<p>「不經一事，不長一智」我這麽想着：「這句俗語，現在可實地證實了。當初聽了翠姐母女的話，把這魔窟看成了龍潭虎穴，所以未動身之前，計劃了又計劃，準備了又準備；外帶還是捨着一條性命來的，誰知裏面情形，原是道們稀鬆平常。可見人人必須有些冒險精神，才能不被宣傳矇蔽，才能實地任事，實地收獲些經騐哩。」想到這裏、覺得我們一番見神見鬼的舉動，眞有些可笑。</p>
<p>我這想着，同時又聽見虎弟的暗示，決定先從這裏着手、做點小小交易。這傢伙呌我們去歇歇，我們可不知道往那裏去歇歇哩；因此反而在那傢伙身傍就地坐下了。這裏我就手　出了隨身的法寶。</p>
<p>「趕得匆忙，巴巴的跑到這兒，香烟都忘了勞，虎弟，沒有？」一邊說，一邊我拿着一捲城裏流行的「軍用券」，點着數目。斜着眼睛瞟過去，那　子的眼睛，經這五光十色的法寶一照，不由得漸漸移動；從書上移到了「券」上，從「券」上到了我的手上，漸漸流到我的手膀，慢慢到了我的臉上。這是一個軟性的緊張局面，好歹就要看他這一下的表情。</p>

<h3>壽</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>今天是蔣主席六秩華誕，全中國老百姓，祗要他愛國家，愛民族，怕沒有一個人不爲之歡欣鼓舞的。因爲，我們的主席，對於我們的這個國家民族興亡成敗的關係太大了，換言之，近卅年來中華民族的命運是繫於他一身的。</p>
<p>我們歌頌，我們禱祝，我們除了用獻校的方式來慶賀紀念外，我們每個中國人還要痛自檢討一下，自己的生活行爲，對得起國家民族沒有，倘使是對不起國家民族的，也就不配來替主席祝壽。</p>
<p>四十年憂勤國事，主席勞瘁一生，而國事仍如此蜩螗，在今天，我們眞該特別覺得慚愧罷！</p>
<h3>元首生平</h3>
<p>— 疾風</p>
<p>北伐　結婚　蒙難　抗戰</p>
<p>「黨國存亡，主義成敗，人民禍福，同志榮辱，在此一戰！」民國十五年七月九日，在廣州小校塲上，蔣主席宣讀着北伐誓詞。吳稚輝先生把一面「國民革命軍總司令」的大壽，授給了主席。從此，主席繼承着國父未竟的遺志，挑起了革命建國的重任。——於茲二十年矣！</p>
<p>北伐時，有一個外國記者去訪問主席，探詢他一生有多少勳業時，主席只在紙上寫下短短的幾個字；「生於浙江省，肄業於保定軍校及日本校，革命時追隨孫總理。」</p>
<p>十六年十二月一日，在上海與宋美齡女士結婚，結婚地點在大華飯店，證婚人是余日章，介紹人是譚延閘，何香凝和王正廷。當時主席年四十，夫人年二十五。主席並撰「我們的今日」一文，在當天的申報上發表，其中說：</p>
<p>「余今日得與余最敬愛之宋美齡女士結婚，實爲余有生以來最光榮之一日，亦爲余有生以來最湔快之一日。……余確信余自今“與宋女士結婚以後，余之革命工作必有進步。余能安心盡革命之責任，即自今日始也！」</p>
<p>國民革命軍進駐了北平，主席在「祭吿總理文」中這樣寫着：「中正自許身黨國，久已矢至死靡他之決心，初不意百戰餘生，尙能留此微軀，詣總理之靈堂而致其瞻禮。今後有生之日，即爲奮鬥之年，竭以全力，濟以忠貞，成敗利鈍，非所計也！」</p>
<p>二十三年的元脊節那天，主席在南昌召開了「新生活運動大會」，到會民衆達十五萬人，佔南昌全市人口四分之三。當主席正在訓話時，有一個精神萎靡，衣衫汚穢的攝影師正想拍幾張照片，主席當下指着那攝影師對聽衆說：「這個人的儀容態度，是十足的舊生活，完全不合新生活的條件，希望大家今後注意，不要像他一樣！」害得那攝影師羞愧無地，拔脚就溜。</p>
<p>主席西安脫險後，有鄕　劉氏，把節雀下來的四千二百文，託南京某報館轉贈主席，並附一信，說是：「請委員長買桂圓喫的。」</p>
<p>「我們旣是一個弱國，如果臨到最後關頭，使只有拚全民族的生命，以求國家的生存，那時節再不容許我們中途妥協！</p>
<p>最後關頭一到，我們只有犧牲到底，抗戰到底；惟有犧牲到底的決心，才能博得最後的勝利！」這是在七七事變發生後，主席在廬山發表具有歷史意義的談話。果然，苦戰了整整八年，最後勝利是獲得了！今天，在舉國恭祝主席的六秩大慶的時候，我們敬祝主席健康！</p>
<h3>自由女神</h3>
<p>— 藍寗</p>
<p>在紐約歡度六秩大慶</p>
<p>美國紐港口貝特羅小島上，巍然聳立着一座驚人高大，身穿古典式希臘長袍的女神之像。她左手執書，右手舉着火炬，迎着來船，在黑夜放出指引的光芒。</p>
<p>這就是舉世聞名的自由神像，不但是世界最大的一座銅像，而且成了今日世界上的「自由的象徵」了。前天，（廿八）是她的六十週年紀念。</p>
<p>但是，當年法國人在巴黎發起建神像贈新大陸的時候，歷盡種種困難，費時幾年。基金是從一家一戶去募集而來是的。那一八六五年，若干藝術家與政治家事集在凡爾賽附近，鑒於法蘭西與美利堅兩國人民曾爲了一個共同目標流過熱血，想趁着那時美國革命的一百週年，建立個紀念像，追懷當年共同奮鬥的眞理。因此名雕刻家巴塞第（Bortnodli）被派赴美國尋覓設計的靈感。</p>
<p>他剛進紐約港，腦中便浮起「自由」的印象。這裏是個龐大的都市，河道延展至遠處，縱目不盡。寬闊的港，是片船舶叢集的內海。這裏應該矗立起那座巨像。於是巴塞第帶着計劃回法國：法國人造神像，美國人造神像的座台。</p>
<p>普法戰爭阻止了計劃的推進，但是甚至在法蘭西大敗之後，目標定四十五萬美元的捐款滾滾而來。一八八一，正式工作才方開始。</p>
<p>巴塞第決定將女鉀的像用銅片來鑄造，分成若干塊，使便於運輸。這些片段的銅片在鐵骨架上裝配起來，中空，內部每一處可通樓梯。</p>
<p>但是可怪的是美國方面竟達遲未能進行，卅五萬美金的神座建築費，一點一滴，募集艱難。到一八八五年的六月自由神像全部在法建造究成，法戰艦Isere號進紐約港時，美國建築花崗石神座的基金，竟還短少着十萬元，那時已是募款的第七個年頭了。因此巴塞第的傑作便只能暫時藏入了一間空堆棧的地下室中。若沒有紐世界日報發行人普立查的資助，也許一直只能藏着了</p>
<p>普立査將他的新聞與社論極力渲染，把自由神像形容成爲一個自由的象徵。在五個月之中，報館收到了十二萬人從全美各處捐獻的一分，一角，一元。</p>
<p>高一五一呎，重二二五噸雄偉莊嚴的自由神像終於在一八八六年十月二十八日揭幕。參加典禮者遊行的行列，擁塞地從百老匯經過，向海口而去。河上船隊載着各國代表觀禮。克里夫蘭總統坐着戰艦Dispatch號也來了。夜間還放射燦爛輝煌的焰火。</p>
<p>現在這自由神像鑄上了個新的美國印章。在她的基石上勒鑿着愛瑪·拉薩魯斯所作的一首十四行詩「新巨人」，以女神的口吻向舊大陸的流亡者呼喊出歡迎的召喚：</p>
<p>願你倦怠的，貧窮的，盡來歸我。</p>
<p>你的擾攘擁塞，渴想着呼吸自由空氣的一羣，</p>
<p>你的廣沃的海岸驅逐出來的可憐的人。</p>
<p>願道些，沒有家的，風打雨淋的，盡送來歸我，</p>
<p>我在這黃金的門旁擎起接引的明燈！</p>
<p>最初自由神手中的火炬是沒有光的。幾年之後，銅片代以玻瑙，裏面放光了。一九一六年，紐世界日報募湊了一筆錢，替她換上永久的强光燈。蒲格勒又將玻瑙燈罩改裝紅琥珀。歐洲戰事勝利後，火炬中裝置了最明亮的水銀燈，替自由女神身上映照着明瑩耀目的色彩。</p>
<p>每年有八十萬個旅客到來膽仰，在她內部攀登。她頭上的皇冠上一圈鑲飾，是一排小窗，旅客便可從這裏遠眺。</p>
<p>巴塞第費了十年心血的一件傑作獲得了寳貴的成就，今日有千千萬萬的人，愛自由的人，已把她看作自由的象徵了。</p>
<h3>緬懷黃克强先生</h3>
<p>— 回也</p>
<p>「十萬貔貅馳騁地，那堪立馬幽燕？羯奴何處且流連；氈　迷落照，狼火銷殘烟。收拾金甌還漢胤，重瞻舜日堯天！國旗五色最莊嚴，亂隨明月影，翻入白雲邊。」</p>
<p>這首慷慨激昻的「臨江　」，出之於革命先烈黃克强先生的手筆。文如其人，將軍忠貞　放之氣，宛然紙上。</p>
<p>讀過歷史的人，都能娓娓贊道他的生平事蹟的，但是，你曾否記得？今天，正是黃克强先生逝世三十週年！</p>
<p>三十年前的今日，滿淸是推翻了，革命初步成功了。正想推行共和，民衆滿以爲從此可以安居樂業。又誰知軍閥華機崛起，爭地奪盤，製造內亂，　年戰　。民不聯生，國家依然瀕於分裂！黃克強先生眼見同志們用頭顱鮮血去爭得來的革侖成果，一些不在。他怎麽不痛心疾首？民國五年十月卅一日，在上海與朋友們縱論時局，越說越氣，　說越憤，卒至嘔血。黃克強先生就是這樣死的。</p>
<p>三十年後的今日，又怎樣呢？日本是給打垮了，國家算是勝利了，正想推進憲政。民衆滿以爲從此可以安居樂業。又誰知竟然如此？使民不聊生，國家瀕於分裂！將士們用頭　鮮血去爭得來的勝利成果，一些不存。黃克强先生如果今天還在世，他也必定會氣憤死的！</p>
<p>中國人眞是如何對得起先烈。</p>

<h3>恭祝　蔣主席六秩華誕文</h3>
<p>— 成愓軒</p>
<p>本文係應南京特別市黨部之請而作，以代表黨員致敬，故篇中於用　主席二字處悉稱總裁。　作者附志</p>
<p>山雄水秀，靈鍾武嶺之鄕；嶽降弧懸，光被瀛寰之表。民國三十五年十月三十一日，實爲中國國民黨總裁　蔣公六秩華誕。祥徵耳順，歡動心聲。靑島通王母之誠，白雉却越裳之貢。南京特別市黨部，仰體謙冲，力屛繁縟。於是會合同志，集體簽名。用致尊崇，以祝難老。禮也。</p>
<p>總裁聖原天縱，覺在人先。以弱冠之年，學萬人之敵。立攘夷之大志，不負師傳；矢報國之精忠，允彰母敎。値滄海橫流之會，正神州鼎革之交。躬從黨人，密預盟誓。撥亂反正，極盤錯之艱難；旋乾轉坤，著非常之事業。舉其大者，可得言焉。肇造共和，光復舊物。掃幽燕之王氣，揚大漢之天聲。策運帷中，威宣閫外。練新軍以整齊部伍，闢專校以陶鑄英豪。斬棘披荆，曾躍東征之馬；弔民伐罪，旋揮北向之戈。底定中原，蕩平羣寇。奠四海一家之局，耀靑天白日之旗。已而坐鎭匡廬，巡行江漢。蠻陬是撫，龍堆鴈磧之演；棨戟遙臨，鳥道蠶叢之外，赤眉歛跡，黔首歸心。方集安內之動，忽報窺邊之警。蘆溝鶴唳，櫻島鯨狂。式詰戎兵，用驅醜虜。飛芻挽粟，接萬國之梯航；嘗膽臥薪，閱八年之歲月。樂陳破陣，城築受降。河山重固其金甌，干戈已化爲玉帛。是爲　總裁之立功。若乃敦飭彝常，篤行忠孝。自雲深處，歌陟屺以悼慈親；碧血堆中，奮登舟而依國父，視僚屬如子弟，開誠布公：來友朋於遠方，講信修睦。揭禮義廉恥之眞諦，生活咸新；革萎靡腐敗之頽風，精神丕煥。慈儉克先於天下，憂勤無間於昕宵。憫鳩澤之災，痌癏在抱；弭驪山之變，金石爲開。是爲總裁之立德。至其資兼文武，學究天人。述尼父之微言，振陽明之墜緒。知行合一，心物無偏。洞盛衰成敗之由，明修齊治平之道。學庸必讀，以科學闡發其精微；國命所關，以專書指陳其方略。定吾黨之守則，義取貞恒；頒軍人之訓條，昭如日月，旁及曾胡語錄，兪戚遺編。郡國利病之書，均翰平準之說。靡不鈎元撮要，溫故知新。又如法布關中，檄喩巴蜀。丁寧切至，憬悌慈祥。士庶爲之動容，將吏聞而感奮。是爲　總裁之立言。夫蓄道德者，未必能文章；炳事功者，大都疎學問。惟我總裁應五百年以名世，備三不朽於一身。繫兆庶之安危，作中流之砥柱。宜其吉　天相。德並川流。頌生佛於萬家，卜期頤於百歲。況此稱　祝釐之慶，適在還都奏凱之餘。邦命維新，國威遠播。西方歌其彼　，東海知有聖人。行見盡豁雰霾，宏開氣運。振興農鑛工商之實業，建設富强康樂之中華。饑饉不生，財用恒足。必能更增齊民之福祉，有裨舉世之和平。所願人罄精誠，羣申善禱。獻校興學，遍聞絃誦之聲；築館藏書，蔚成圖籍之府。陳力就列，赴義急公。各竭其智能，共臻於郅治。則所以增錫純嘏，奉揚休光者，良未有艾。中與在望，南極騰輝，澤物皆春，溪口碧澄一色；與崧同峻，蔣山靑到千秋。請俟杖國之年，再進壽人之曲。</p>

<h3>主席手訂親釋　青年守則</h3>
<p>第一，『忠勇爲愛國之本。』我們愛國救國，首先要養成忠勇的精神和德性，同時我們的忠心和勇氣，必須用之於愛國家，必須用之於救國家，必須爲公而不爲私，爲人而不爲己。所以忠勇的眞義，就是古人所謂『盡忠報國』，所謂『殺身成仁』，所謂『公爾忘私，國爾忘家，』所謂『勇於公戰，怯於私鬥。』</p>
<p>第二，『孝順爲齊家之本。就是我們要使家庭能够雍容和睦，上下有條有理，整齊一致，造成安樂美滿的家庭，一定先要從孝順父母做起。因爲必須盡孝道，然後尊卑有別，長幼有序，才能使家庭的事頭頭是道，事事有理，乃可以發揚光大。</p>
<p>第三，『仁愛爲接物之本。』所謂接物，是包括對人的交際與對事物的處理而言。我們接物的標準，就是要『仁愛』；即古人所謂『仁民愛物』。我們要愛同胞，愛朋友，以至愛人類，愛宇宙萬物，所謂『民吾同胞，物吾與也』，『天地與我並生，萬物與我爲一。就是仁愛的精神。我們本着這種偉大的精神，來待人處事用物，一定可以處處得人之愛，獲人之助，憲物之用。如此自己有一分的努力，至少可以發生十分的效果。所有愛我們的一切力量，都可以變成我們的力量，更可以增加無數倍的力量。</p>
<p>第四，『信義爲立業之本』。我們要想做出一番事業，一定要得到人家的信仰與帮助；要得到人家的信仰和帮助，一定要自己先有信義。與人交接，先要從事實上表現我的信仰和道義，使人家相信我們，決不是背信忘義，自私自利，偸生怕死的人可以做到的。我們必先有義氣和信仰，然後人家才會相信我們，我們才可以成功事業。</p>
<p>第五，『和平爲處世之本』。所謂和平，是就人與人的關係而言；『和』就是要互相親愛，不可有忌妬，猜疑，相駡相打，甚至自相殘殺的事情。『平』就是要彼此公正，不可有侵越，爭奪，欺侮偏私，損人利己的事情。必須公平，才能親愛；必須和平，才可處世；個人在社會要以和平待人，凡是我們的同胞，都要相親相愛，凡事寗肯自己吃虧，不可佔人家的便宜；要曉得主張公道保持和平的人，一定可以得到最後的成功。眼前喫小虧的人，到最後一定能佔到便宜；眼前佔小便宜的人，最後一定要喫大虧。凡是我們的同胞，一定要明白這個道理，和平相處。我們第一步要實現整個國家永遠的和平，成功一個最和平的國家。第二步更要將我們中國的和平貢獻於世界，實現全世界普遍的和平。和平是我們中國固有的美德，我們是永遠主張和平。但是我們爲保持國家生存，和民族的生存，當然要有自衛的能力和決心；如果有外國人要來侵略我們，壓迫我們，這是他來破壞和平，擾亂和平，我們要爲保持公道正義，不得不周旋抵抗，以努力求得最後之和平。所以對外在一切和平手段用盡，和平已經絕望的時候，也只能而且必須於和平手段之外，更求獨立自存與鞏固和平之道。</p>
<p>第六，『禮節爲治事之本。』這就是我們要辦好事情，一定要注重禮節；因爲沒有禮節，無論社會與人事，便沒有秩序，亦不能安定，人與人的關係，更要紛亂，一切事情，都無從做起。古人說：『禮者理也！』意思就是我們做人做事，要有條理，要有節制，要有正常合理的態度和規矩。我們要做人做事，便隨時隨地要注意禮節；否則，不能做人，更不能辦事。所以說：『不知禮，無以立。』『禮者，事之治也。君子有其事必有其治；無禮則手足無所措，耳目無所加，進退揖讓無所制，田獵戎事失其策，軍旅武功失其制。』</p>
<p>第七，『服從爲負責之本。』我們要使國家當强，必須國民人人能負起責任共同努力。道個責任如何負得起來，大家工作如何才能事半功倍呢？最要緊的就橫的關係而言，就是要彼此分工，大家合作；就縱的關係來講，就要層層節制；現在我們國家一切事情，不能做好，國家弄到如此危急存亡的地步，就是因爲一般人只知爭權奪利，不肯負責盡職，個個人都要講自由平等，結果國家民族便要滅亡。不曉得現代國民應當犧牲自己的自由平等，來求整個國家的自由平等；今後我們要救國，必須大家負責，負責的根本前提，就是人人要犧牲個人的自由平等，服從政府，服從法令，服從長官，來盡到自己的職責。政府是國家的機關，法令是國家的意志，長官是政府的代表，所以我們服從長官，不是服從個人，乃是服從他根據國家法律所發的命令。總之我們的服從，是服從國家，服從職務，就是服從我自己的責任。因爲國家是我自己的，職務也是自己的，這樣服從，亦就是服從我自己本身。如果我能服從我自己，這就呌『克己』；凡能克己的人，無不成功的。所以我們爲國家來服從，而不是服從那一個人，更不是服從私人，所以這種服從是光榮，而不是恥辱。必須如此，才能眞正的服從，才能眞正的負責，不愧爲現代的一個國民！</p>
<p>第八，『勤儉爲服務之本。』我們自己是社會國家的一份子，所以爲社會國家服務，即是自己服務，我爲人人，即人人爲我，這是自助樂羣的第一要義。必須如此，人生才有意義和價値。我們爲社會國家服務，應從何處做起呢？就是要勤勞儉樸。必須勤勞，然後能有貢獻；必須節儉，然後能有節制，能免消耗。在第一方面，我們克勤克儉的目的，必須是爲人羣服務；所以勸儉如果是爲私而不是爲公，所謂『鷄鳴而起，孳孳爲利』的那一等人的樣式，這種勤儉，於國於民，無所裨益，實非眞正的節儉。我們要曉得生在現代，沒有整個的社會，整個的民族，和整個的國家，便沒有一般人饑寒，自己一個人可以溫暖，一般人困苦，自己一個人可以安樂的事情。所以必須立定『先憂後樂』的志氣，發揮勞動服務的精神，立人即所以立己，救人亦所以自救。</p>
<p>第九，『整潔爲治身之本。』所謂治身，係兼指內心與身體的修養而言。我們要治身，就要從整潔做起；務必內而專靜純一，淸明在躬；外而整齊嚴肅，潔靜光明；推而至於四週之事物，生活之環境，都要使能如此，然復能身强體健。品性高尙，志慮精明。一般人不知道整潔的重要，甚至如過去一般名士派，以不整潔自命疏在，謬稱風雅，這種惡習與恥辱，我們應當剷除洗刷。伹是我所謂整潔，是要澹泊樸素，而與奢侈美麗，是絕對不同的。</p>
<p>第十，『助人爲快樂之本。』我們做人，當然都要求快樂，但是求快樂不得其道，便要求得痛苦，造成罪惡。例如現在一般人，以爲閒散玩耍，標賭逍遙是快樂；不知道這些事不但不是快樂，而且正是浪費精神，摧殘自己的生命，增加自己的罪惡和痛苦。不知道人心眞正的最大快樂，莫如助人。古人說：『旣已爲人己愈有，旣己與人已愈多。』又說：『爲善最樂。』就是說我們愈能助人，愈有好處，愈加快樂。現在童子軍有一個信條，『日行一善。』也就要是助人。例如援溺救火，扶老保幼，救助貧寒饑苦傷痛貧苦等類，事無大小，都是行善；行善便可以獲得眞正的快樂。凡是中華民國的同胞，大家都要如此求樂，互相親愛，彼此互助，只要有一分力量，一定要盡一分力量來援助我們的同胞。這是莫大的怏樂。</p>
<p>第十一，『學問爲濟世之本。』這句話的意思，一方面是說我們要濟世救民，必須有學問有能力。即總理說：『革命的基礎，在高深的學問」的意思。另一方面是說我們硏究一切學問技能的目的，是要濟世，是要救人，不是無目的無意義的，不是求個人溫飽與安樂的，更不是假學問技術來損人利己，濟奸作惡的。</p>
<p>第十二，『有恒爲成功之本。』我們大家當然個個人希望百己能够成功立業，成功立業，最要緊的條件是什麼？就是要有恒。無論作何事，一定要繼續不斷的努力，不好中途而廢，或見異思遷。一定要有始有終，貫澈到底。尤其我們要成功終身的事樊，一定要擇一條光明正大的道路，努力前進，至死不變，做到總理遺訓最後兩句『一心一德，貫澈始終。』</p>
<h3>祝壽紀念册　今由專員晋京呈獻</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今天爲蔣主席六秩華誕，全國同慶，薄海共歡。上海市各界雖熱烈舉行各種慶祝節目，但並不足以報答我們勞苦功高的　主席，而僅僅表示四百萬市民對　主席敬仰之意。</p>
<p>主席崇尙儉的，曾再三昭示各方勿予舖張。本市各界因此發動各種建設性的事業，其含義深長。除了獻校祝壽和舉辦種種獎金外，上海市另外備了一本紀念册呈獻主席。</p>
<p>這本册子長的十二吋半，寬十吋，厚四吋，由籌備委員會設計組主辦，龐京周醫師曾盡了最大努力。耙念册封面及封底用織錦綢裱糊，封面田黨國元老吳敬恒題書「上海市民恭祝蔣主席六　榮慶紀念册」，裏面都用白綾紙裱成，共一百零二頁，正面全部用黃色紙糊，每頁分八格，上書全市各團體機關名共八百零二單位，下面由各單位主管人簽名，以市參議會列第一。反面則全部裱二尺寬國畫共七十幅，都係海上名畫家傑作，排外决序並不規定，僅山水略爲分隔，但第一幅畫則出自名畫家姚虞琴手筆，因他今年高壽八十，居各畫家之長。此乃一幅蘭花岡，題爲「王者之香」。</p>
<p>連日來前往寗彼同鄉會簽名的陸續不斷，有許多市民要求簽上，但因規定由各機關負責人代表，故都悵然而退。這紀念册已定在今天由專員代表晋京呈獻　主席。</p>
<h3>中正科學獎金　全部基金三億元　由青年團員捐贈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕三民主義靑年團上海支團部爲慶祝　主席華誕，前日經中央團部決定籌設中正科學獎金，及中正圖書館，以示敬賀。科學獎金預定基金三億元，圖書館預定基金二億元，中央團部指定上海支團部負責籌募二千萬元。據試團負責人語記者稱：該項基金將全部由團員捐贈，不向外界籌募，有職業之幽員正發動捐助二日所得，並稱團員自動捐輸甚爲踴躍，將超出預定數目。</p>

<h3>蔣主席的教育思想</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室輯</p>
<p>教育理論</p>
<p>辦敎育的，看敎育有沒有效力，沒有第二句話，就是意志一臨。我們想要達求學的目的，沒有旁的方法，也就是看意志能不能一致。—十四年四月七日對軍校第三期學生訓詞。</p>
<p>德性體魄與科學　今後敎育設施，務須依照中華民國敎育宗旨及其實施方針之規定，特別注意於固有德性之培義，强健體魄之鍜鍊，與夫近世科學之灌輸。—二十年五月十七日在國民會議閉會式講。</p>
<p>做人　本來敎育最高的目的，就要使受敎育的人，能够做個好國民，做個好人，如果一個學生不曉得愛國，不曉得做人的道理，敎育的效力就等於零。所以現在我們救國的第一要點，就是注重敎育，更要注重訓育，注意使學生能知禮義廉恥，這是復興民族挽救國家重要的一點。—二十一年十月三十一日在長沙中山紀念堂擴大紀念週講。</p>
<p>敎與育　我們現在學校裏的敎育，不能僅是敎，而且是要育，一定要敎育並用。現在之所謂敎育，就是敎而不育，不是完全的敎育。我以爲敎育的成份，是敎佔三分之一，育要佔到三分之二。—同上。</p>
<p>這「敎育」兩個字，普通一般人只知道是一件事情，結果不是「敎而不育」，便是「育而不敎」。不曉得這「敎」與「育」兩個字，完全是兩件事情，要兩件事情同樣注意，都能做好。才能够算是所謂「敎育」。怎麼樣呌做「敎」呢？敎就是要敎我們的部下或學生，使他們知范做人的道理，和成功立業的方法，使他能成功一個人。做人的道理是甚麼呢？怎麽樣纔能够敎他成功一個人呢？做人的道理，精神上最重要的就是我所講的「禮義廉恥」。「禮義廉恥」就是我們敎的一個精神。我們一定要使得受敎的人，明瞭禮節，崇尙道義，注重淸廉，知道恥辱，才算是知道做人的道理，才能實實在在做一個人，至於所謂「育」是什麽呢？育就是養，養的意義，就是保育，具體的講講就是要給他生活必需的東西，要敎他基本生活的方式，即所謂食衣住行四件大事。—二十二年九月十日在廬山軍官團訓話。</p>
<p>僅是「育」不行，一定要「敎」，而且「敎」要在「育」之先，敎的科目，就是禮，樂，射，御，書，數；敎的基本要素，就是禮義廉恥。—二十二年九月二十日在星子縣對合作人員訓練班訓詞。</p>
<p>認識時代認識本國　知識技能的傳習，僅爲敎育功能之一部，必須灌注以愛國家。愛民族。愛同胞之精神，課之以負荷民族興亡與完成國民革命之責任，敎之以認識時代，認識太國，正視世界，遠矚未來之意義。—二十九年二月二十日寒假届滿學期更始勉各級敎師電。</p>
<p>國家三要素　敎育，經濟，武力，爲構成現代國家生命力之三要素，而敎育實爲其樞紐。—二十九年十月卅一日中正大學創校紀念訓詞。</p>
<p>盡忠國家　我們教學的目的，第一步自然要敎他在天地之間，做個眞正的人。第二步成爲中華民國一個良好的國民，能够愛護國家，盡忠於國家。具體的講：就是要使個個學生，存深厚的國家觀念，和深刻的民族意識；絕對不會學做外國人，亦絕對不會作洋奴，充漢奸，而是能積極的犧牲一己來愛國家，保民族。—二十四年五月十九日對昆明中等以上各學校員生訓詞。</p>
<p>兼善天下　我們爲學的目的和效用，可以說就是「濟世安民」四個字，也就是古人所謂「兼善天下」的意思。—同前。</p>
<p>教育政策</p>
<p>建設　現在國民革命，雖未完全成功，伹是破壞時期，已經過去了。如果再用破壞的手段，像從前一樣的去革命，則其結果，必遭失敗。所以我們現在辦理敎育，第一要注意的，就是建設</p>
<p>嚴　現在中國救國的方法，就是一個敎育，而敎育唯一的方針，就是一個「嚴」字。—二十年四月十六日在浙江大學講。</p>
<p>新學風　國家將來的前途，統統要從敎育做起，第一步就要把學風完全變更過來，要成功眞正的一個革命的新學風，救國的學風。—二十一年十月十日對武漢大學敎職員訓話。</p>
<p>固有文化　我們要建設一個國家，就先要建設我們自己的文化；要建設中國自己的文化，在中國還不必一下子怎麽建設，只要能眞正恢復我們固有的民族文化，而以新時代之精神來運用就行。—二十二年九月二十日在星子縣對合作人員訓練班訓詞。</p>
<p>行的敎育　我國今後的敎育，務須矯正過去一切空疏，迂闊，頹廢，散漫的積習，造成活潑，進取，強毅，團結，力行的風氣。如此才能算是行的敎育，才可以充實國家的生命力，達到敎育救國的目的。——二十四年五月十九日對昆明中等以上各學校員生訓詞</p>
<p>人盡其才　立國之道，不外　總理所示『人盡其才，地盡其利，物盡其用，貨暢其流』四大綱領，而論其根本，允在乎「人盡其才」，欲求「人盡其才」，其根本又在敎育之完善。——二十四年六月九日在成都行轅召見敎育界訓詞。</p>
<p>六藝兼脩　我國古代的敎育，本來是文武合一，術德兼條約現在一般以爲文學校只講文藝，不要講武藝，這完全是錯誤了。今後學校敎育，還是要根據古人文武合一的精神，與六藝兼修的原則來辦，不過敎育的內容，更要充實。——二十四年六月十七日在成都第三次擴大紀念週購。</p>
<p>質的改良　我們今後要發展敎育，一方面固然要設法普及，以求數量的增加；但一方面尤其要力求質的改良，以期進步。就我們現在的力量與事實上的需要而論，目前對於敎育，應當先謀質的改進，而數量的擴充，還在其次。——二十五年五月十日行政會議開幕訓詞。</p>
<p>教師問題</p>
<p>自家先來做　敎人的東西，一定要自家先來做到纔行，如其不管自己做得做不得，只管要求人家去做，這就是自己欺騙自己。——十三年在黃埔軍校講。</p>
<p>革自已的命　從事敎育的人，要天天革自己的命，然後才能使學生好。且容易使學生命他蹈火，他就蹈火：命他赴水，他就赴水；這才能得到好的結果。——十五年五月三日在黃埔講。</p>
<p>勿利用學生　我們今後要整頓敎育，挽救學風，最要緊的就是敎職員要潔身自愛，要敎學生做人，不要利用學生做工具。——二十一年十一月七日在長沙中山紀念堂擴大紀念週訓話。</p>
<p>實際生活　我們中國近幾十年來的敎育，偏重於知識技術的傳授，而對於敎者本身生活的整飭，與受敎者實際生活的指導，缺少注意，所敎所學的東西幾乎與實際生活毫不相關，或者根本脫節。—二十八年三月五日招待第三次全國敎育會議出席人員演詞。</p>
<p>指導思想　教師們應毅然肩負指導學生思想，陶冶學生品性，管理學生生活，鍛鍊學生體力，健全學生人格之責任。——二十九年二月二十日勉各級敎師電。</p>
<p>敎育界的責任　如果我們敎育界人士有魄力，有精神，負責任，盡職守，能够改革頽風，變化氣質，使一般社會靑年，景然從風，受到我們的感化，來爲國家民族，共同一致奮發努力，那我們的三民主義，就可以完全實現，建國事業，就可以大吿成功。——三十年七月二日對三民主義靑年團全國幹部工作會議訓詞。</p>
<p>神聖事業　敎育事業即是神聖的事業，亦即聖賢的事業。惟聖賢才能感化他人，才能使一般受敎者循乎正道，完滿發育，以達到聖神功化的極致。同上。</p>
<p>主席故鄉風光</p>
<p>（上）主席別墅—妙高台。（下）武嶺學校—校務長施季言先生。（中央社攝）</p>
<p>訓育問題</p>
<p>自己研究敎育目的最大的一點，就是要希望敎育者自己去研究，自己去管理才有進步，不是硬要靠敎育者來監督的。否則，敎育結果，必定不好。受敎育者要是不明白這一點，自己不去研究，不求進步，定要敎育者來監督管理，這就是不能自立，不能自強，不能自治。——十五年一月十三日在黃埔講。</p>
<p>以人格來感化　敎人先要敎他做人的道理，亦可以說是要使他能確定他的人生觀；如此方能算是敎育，如此方能算是敎成健全的靑年國民，如此方能使學生不浪漫，不放恣，不做越出學生本份以外的事情。要做到這樣的效力，我們做敎師的個人，就不得不朝於斯，夕於斯，在無形無聲之間，注重做訓育的工作。所以我們敎師必須以自己的人格來感化學生，就要先以人格來訓育學生，方才事半功倍，得到救國的效能。——二十一年七月十八日至二十日在怡和邨對武漢教育界訓話。</p>
<p>啓發誘導　最要一點，即須使學生人人能知做人的道理與學生的責任，並於訓導與實踐之中，養成其爲社會國家服務之精神，與勞動之習慣。靑年之心性皆白璧無瑕，而又活潑好動，敎者果能率其純善之天性，而盡啓發誘導之能事，未有不能成爲健全良好之國民，爲社會服務勞動。以盡其國民之本份者。——二十四年六月九日在成都行營召見敎育界訓詞。</p>
<p>目前最急迫需要而可收速效的，還在乎以輾轉化導的方法，從事於社會與人心的改造。——二十四年七月二日在成都對各縣紳耆訓話。</p>

<h3>山明水秀話溪口</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>溪口主席的誕生地，是一片山明水秀的地方，它有着江南水鄕所特有的明媚，但四周又羣山環抱，峯　起伏，在南方的淸新中更帶着一重北國的沉毅雄偉。自然，環境對於人的影響常常是很大的，愛琴海上淸澈蔚藍的天空給了希臘人以明朗的哲學的智慧，而英倫三島上的層層濃霧，亦賦與了英國人以沉邃堅毅的性格。溪口，它風光的明媚，民情的惇樸，加上千丈巖畔的流泉淙淙，連山峯上的白雪皚皚，都自　幼使主席陶冶成了一種明朗，睿智，仁愛，堅毅的性格。</p>
<p>觀光之路</p>
<p>到這一代偉人的誕生地去觀光贍仰的人們，大都先到寗波，然後搭鄞奉公路的長途汽車到奉化去。汽車在道條砂石混舖的公路上向前飛駛，經過了大的一小時多的旅程，過了江口橋，奉化縣城即已在望。奉化是一座面積五千多方里的城市，人口目前有二三十萬人。這裏有兩所中學，縣立奉化中學和泰淸中學。奉化中學創於前淸光緒年間，原名鳳麓學堂，爲主席少年時的就讀之所。</p>
<p>從奉化城到縣屬的溪口站，首先映入眼簾的便是莊嚴巍峨的武嶺門，門兩旁植着許多大樹，炎夏之日，林蔭深處，蟬聲和鳴，旅客到此，都感到心上有一種說不出的淸凉恬適。武嶺門上有主席親題的一武嶺」兩個大字，門內有不少現代式的宏偉建築，那就是武嶺學校和武嶺醫院。</p>
<p>錦溪近景</p>
<p>武嶺學校有初中和小學，今年並增設了高中，目前學生有七百多人，學生求學都無須繳任何費用，校中並有醫院，農塲，林園，甚至有小規模的罐頭廠。學生們一面求學，一面也以課餘的時光參加着生產工作。武嶺學校的校長是由主席親兼的，校務則由敎務長施季言氏主持。學校在勝利後初收復時，校舍已被弄得七零八亂，裏面也是被破壞得一塌糊塗，伹現在，已經完全修葺一新了。新建的校舍是中西合璧式，屋頂仿宮殿式，屋身則爲西式，四周植樹，環境淸幽。</p>
<p>在武嶺學校附近，面臨錦溪，有一座供遊客休憇用的凉亭，稱爲八角亭。八角亭位於山石之上，四邊花木扶疏，你迎風佇立在亭前，憑欄下望，溪口的明媚風光，就能盡收眼底。向北望，則便是一條長長的溪口正街，街一面傍溪，另一面則盡是店舖，夾着一些靑葱的樹木。溪口街上的店鋪都是很小的，因爲那裘的居民大都以務農爲生。電信局也在那裏。鎭上還有一個警察所，伹通警長警察一共也才不過十二個人。溪口民風的淳厚，使警察成了可有可無的人物。</p>
<p>忠孝傳家</p>
<p>溪口鎭上的蔣家祠，門前有主席親題的「忠孝傳家」四字。主席的故居，即溪口鎭五十一號，是一所樸實的老式房子。走進了白粉牆的洞門，入內便是幾進南方式的屋子；中間是堂屋，供着神位，蔣母王太夫人的遺像也掛在那裏，兩旁放着幾把嵌有大理石的椅子和茶几。折入裏面，也有一排恬靜而質樸的房屋，這就是一代偉人誕生的所在。</p>
<p>由此前行，到魚鱗山脚下，拾級而登，不久即可望見蔣母墓廬。山腰石級的兩旁，松柏翠茂，碎影滿地，時或傳來一陣陣淸幽的花香，加上林間小鳥的淺吟低唱，以忠孝敎子的王太夫人，就長眠在這裏。墓廬進門上有一個匾額，上書「慈庵」兩字，爲譚延闓氏手筆。後面有一所碑亭，石碑上刻着國父祭蔣母文。碑亭的兩邊，右邊是主席的臥室，主席來時，時常住在這裏。左邊則爲會客室，放着一些普通的沙發和桌椅。再循山徑而上，即抵蔣母墓前，墓前有石碑，刻着國父手書的「蔣母之墓」四個大字。</p>
<p>妙高雪竇</p>
<p>溪口的風景，最著名的就是妙高台和雪寳寺。妙高合在四明山上，展眼四望，四周都是重重疊疊的高山，雲在它們上面緩緩飄過，人到此地，胸襟都爲之一廣。妙高合對面三里許，就是雪寳寺，它附近的千丈巖瀑布，是一個有名的風景勝地。千丈巖面臨懸崖深淵，瀑布在巖上奔騰而下，有如一匹白練，迂迥盤旋而至上隱潭，四面削壁，僅一路可通。山上竹林茂盛，有避暑佳地之譽。</p>
<p>溪口的竹林極多，許多人家都有竹園，以此作爲一種副業，筍是幾乎一年四季都有的，春天有竹筍，竹筍過後則有毛筍大筍，夏天有鞭筍，到冬天還有冬筍。筍除了新鮮時運去外埠外，還常在鹽水中燒過後晒乾，製成筍乾。寗波筍乾是一樣名產，也是主席所心愛的　菜。</p>
<p>溪口並沒有因爲是主席的誕生地而變得了富麗繁華，但是，因爲它產生了這樣的一個偉人，使全中國的人民今日都懷着感激的敬意記得了它的名字了。</p>
<h3>獻校祝壽　滬工友捐工資半天</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市總工會及所屬各工會代表，昨日上午至寗波同鄕會，於祝壽紀念册上簽名，並定於三十一日下午參加祝壽，且已決定全市工人捐工資半日，作爲獻校基金，據聞總工會將請求於所獻各校中，選擇一二，定名勞工學校。</p>
<h3>最好的禮物　獻校運動　全國普遍展開中</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>本年十月三十一日欣逢蔣主席六秩壽辰，上海市參議會於九月二十一日通過「發動慶祝元首花甲榮慶，建立永久紀念，以示崇德報功」案，並規定辦法四項：（一）由該會通函全市各民衆團體，組織慶祝元首花甲榮慶籌備曾。（二）由該會正副議長代表參加籌備會。（三）由籌備會援照五旬榮慶獻機祝壽成例，妥擬慶祝辦法，樹立更有意義之永久紀念。（四）通電各省市參議會一致進行。</p>

<p>自本市發起獻校祝壽運動以後，當即獲得各地普遍響應，首都方面，市民團體紛紛自行集議，籌備慶祝。市政會議中，決議發起「首都各界獻校祝壽運動」，藉以掃除文盲普及敎育。十月八日舉行會議，擬定獻校六十所，預計需費六十億元。</p>
<p>天津獻校祝壽運動，也同時展開，十月十八日成立津市獻校祝壽常務委員會，發動市民每人獻納千元運動，公敎人員各獻一日所得，定二十九日截止收款，獻校數目，當視募得款數決定。</p>

<p>陜西省黨部爲慶祝主席壽辰，特發動全省黨員捐獻一日所得，集款興辦最完善之國民小學，詳細辦法，已經擬談。</p>
<p>安徽各界，決定獻校祝壽辦法，於安慶，蚌埠，蕪湖，合肥各設中正小學一所。其餘各縣，則就現有完整之中心國民學校，改設中正小學。</p>
<p>山西省青年團支團部，亦決定籌辦中正小學一所，以賀蔣公誕辰。</p>

<p>新疆回敎人士，發起創辦伊斯　中正中學一所，以響應獻校祝壽。</p>
<p>東北現已收復之各蒙旗，及綏遠，熱河各蒙旗，除每旗擬呈獻蒙漢文合璧錦旗一面外，並各設立完全小學一所，定名爲某旗中正小學，以祝蔣主席壽。</p>
<p>長春市新運會，曾在十月四日，遍邀各界，討論響應獻校祝壽，議定具體辦法，積極進行。任滬軍第五團團長。同時，海外華僑，亦皆紛紛響應，捐款獻校。</p>
<p>綜觀各省市的熱烈響應情形，可見「獻校祝壽」確是意義深長的舉動。建國復興，應由敎育開始，尤其是常此失學兒童遍及全國的今日，增設學校，以提高人民的知識程度，培養下一代建國幹部的基礎，自然是最刻不容緩的事情，而且也是人民所能够呈獻主席的最好的禮物。</p>

<h3>攘夷頌（並序）</h3>
<p>皇皇赤縣，實我黃冑，禹甸勻勻，周原膴膴，宅天下中，爰肇邊患，自古而然矣。溯自玁狁，犬戎，匈奴，西域，吐蕃，回給，契丹，金元，歷四千禩，世禍中國，俶擾黎元，憑陵疆土，然不旋踵，臣服敗滅，携其土地，入我版圖，始則犬羊縱橫，終且方輿日拓，穹廬游牧之衆，釐爲編戶，南曁北戶之俗，咸奉正朔，使我廣土衆民，誕敷聲敎，四裔一家，五族一國，至今而逾大，實夷狄之賜也。其間先敗後勝，欲取故予，雖曰天意，豈非人事哉？三皇五帝，炳炳靈靈，舜禹受命，咨爾歷數，商周嬗禪，奕世載德，積功累仁，以有天下，漢彰赤帝之符，唐紀晋水之瑞，以逮宋明，競守慮失，蓋莫不上承天運，下浹人心，聽視自民，受命於穆，是以興王令主，重熙累洽九族克諧，重譯向化，粤稽往策，豈曰偶然？蓋華夏，神冑也，中土，大器也，未有承運無本，功德不紀，而以鷄鳴狗盜奄有區宇者也。夫以中國之人，據中國之位，如秦皇，隋文，魏武，蕭梁，有其雄才大略，不知愛民務德，則猶鼎折餗覆，大命立傾，况乃非類異種，島夷兇族，乃欲兼弱乘危，窺竊神器，恃其堅甲利兵之資，欲逞盜竊掠奪之慾，鹵莽滅裂，輕啓兵戎者哉？誠欲效法金元故智，亦必度德量力，布惠務仁，尊信重義，收拾人心，誠能若此，則中國危矣。夏蟲不可語冰，蟪蛄不識春秋，胡兮無人，焉足語此？爾乃輕淺躁妄，屠殺焚炸，妄蓄開疆闢土之謀，而爲殘殺淫掠之事，醜德惡性，爆露全球，君子於是知其微矣。其上將大酋，傾全國之師，竭數紀之財，受蠡種推　之寄，而爲闖獻流寇之行，乃欲霸九有之衆，膺神明之祚，胡天不辰，乃用此輩！天奪其魄，中國之福也，我雖舊邦，其命維新。人心未一，國防未修，以無備之邦，當久伺之寇，倉卒應敵，强弱懸殊，丁丑抗戰之初，彼利我鈍，勢也，亦理也。天眷中國，篤生</p>
<p>蔣公，置身於積弱之餘，當仁於危難之際，臨深履薄，沐雨櫛風，焦苦勤勞，兀兀終日，天下之人，心悅誠服，咸以愛國者愛</p>
<p>蔣公，於是諸黨輸誠，各軍用命萬民固結，內患悉泯，生者毀家以犒師，死者暴骨而無怨。當此之時，勝敗之機，間不容髮，而勝敗之數，可以前知矣。</p>
<p>蔣公外效遷幽之避，內飲在莒之痛，處困肩鉅，不　不竦，整軍經武，振旅誓師，慮周萬幾，神營九塞，旣繕旣飭，旣攻旣同，第二期戰，於今三載，運智於方張之寇，決勝於旣敗之後，不亦戞戞其難哉！則苟無</p>

<p>蔣公，是無中國也。微管仲，吾其左袵！孔子曰：如其仁，如其仁。圻東吳下士生際承平，光緒甲午之役，圻方壯歲，嘗侍李文忠公座，語及東事，公莊容語圻曰：中日大戰，必不可免，早發則禍小，遲發則禍大，爾識余言，老必見之。雖然中國必不亡，必有名世間生，以當大任，而非今日之事也，不圖四十五年後，果以垂老之年，目覩南渡之禍，播遷流離，四海鼎沸，追溯中日之戰，其時</p>

<h3>上海市民公祝　主席蔣公六十壽言</h3>
<p>民國三十五年，即東征全勝之翌年，十月三十一日恭介</p>
<p>主席蔣公六十壽辰。上海全體市民思所以爲壽，而責其言於軍士釗。土釗囊然久之，以謂壽人非古，壽一國元首尤非古。何以言之？元首以宇爲家，以宙爲世，八間甲子，馮足以限之。况其所爲立極示範者，一日萬幾，具有脈絡，絕非市井小民所得妄加指點，任意尸祝。雖然，孔子之道，一以貫之，五帝精微，祗十六字。吾儕執簡測多，由一窺萬，以負得正，具體言之，從</p>
<p>主席所標新生活準的，禮義廉恥四字，推及其餘。樹紀綱壹統類，一切之計，應不中不遠。蓋禮者，刑之對，旨在防患未然。義者，禁民爲非之謂。廉者，有所不受之謂。恥者，有所不爲之謂。之四端者，一例偏於消極，爲萬象萬事張本。自來才桀之土，發憤自張，好大喜功，以芒芴爲可輕，屋漏爲可護。馴至小之詿誤刑章，大之　亂軍國者，何可勝紀。獨我</p>
<p>主席致慎於此，自無爲中堅植有爲之落。遂能摧陷廓清，成革命之大勳。堅忍不拔，致强敵於惨敗。試問軍與八年，吾軍容器械，逈不如人，初期惟日國蹙，何止百里。而乃艱苦卓絕，媾和浮議，不足動其毫髮，卒獲全勝，蔚成中與，古今中外所號出類披萃之首領人物，有誰堪之。漢高祖五載而成帝業，事同略地。華盛頓率十三州而獨立，並無劇戰。方此殆蔑如也。昔張九成對宋高宗曰：願陛下以剛大爲心，無以驚憂自沮。之二話者：貌似老生常談，而質言之，除我</p>
<p>主席以外，更有伊誰，能舉其實。於是高宗以北宋全盛之局，釀成偏安。我</p>
<p>主席以吾次殖民地位，躋登强國。何種因得何種果，昭昭揭日月，而行非偶然已。上海爲革命發祥之域，市民爲帡幪切近之徒，是義也，體之深而晉之熟，以爲壽之大者，無過以至德要道詔示天下後世，爰煮沐九頓首以言。</p>

A pair of red candles and a pot of fresh flowers are placed on the table. On the left wall is a recent full-body oil painting of the Chairman in casual clothes, which was respectfully painted based on the photo taken by the Chairman on the fifteenth day of the ninth lunar month. A cake is placed on the table, and two scrolls of the Old Man of the South Pole are on the right wall. Several pairs of colored lanterns and palace lanterns are hung on the top wall, with harmonious colors and dazzling light. From 8:00 AM, people from all walks of life in the capital will hold a dedication ceremony at the society. It is expected that Mayor Ma will be sent by the civil officials to be the receiving officer. All those who participate in the birthday celebration will be in groups of sixty, arranged in three rows.

<h3>President Dai Chuanxian Respectfully Narrates Chairman's Life and Words and Deeds; Filial Piety, Loyalty, Faithfulness, Diligence in Self-Discipline and Returning to Propriety</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency's Nanjing Dispatch on the 30th] President Dai Chuanxian specially narrated the main points of the Chairman's life and his thoughts and behaviors as follows to celebrate the Chairman's sixtieth birthday: (1) He is extremely filial to his mother, extremely fraternal to his brothers, extremely loyal to others, and extremely trustworthy to friends, all of which have reliable examples to follow. (2) He is strict to his subordinates but lenient inside, and the same is true for his students. Throughout his life, he has treated people and disciplined himself with propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sincere spirit of love. (3) He is a model soldier throughout his life. His virtue of stopping war for martial arts, saving the world, saving people, and saving the country can be seen in his achievements over the past thirty years. (4) He never slacks off and always acts immediately upon knowing, so he uses the philosophy of diligent practice as his educational purpose. (5) In battle, he is never discouraged in defeat, nor is he arrogant in victory. From the Northern Expedition in the 14th year of the Republic of China until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, all his words and deeds broadcast to the Japanese people were for this purpose. (6) In his personal life, he devoted himself to the work of self-discipline and returning to propriety. From every drink and every meal to walking, living, sitting, and lying down, he strives to do good. Confucius said that Yanzi did not violate benevolence for three months, which is almost an understatement. The above is what Xian has truly observed and learned, and I respectfully record it as a lesson for the people to follow.</p>
<h3>Chairman Convenes a Banquet for Government Representatives, Instructing on Peace Talks; The Communist Party Still Refuses to Submit the National Assembly List</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch on the 30th] After the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and social elites submitted and then withdrew their proposals because they were not accepted by both parties, negotiations almost stalled again. Later, because Chairman Chiang stated that oral suggestions could be put forward for further discussion and a decision made, the mediators were also very willing to continue their efforts. They re-drafted a new oral proposal and asked Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu to discuss it together at 3:00 PM on the 30th, presented the prepared plan and put it to discussion. The discussion ended around 5:00 PM. On the one hand, government representatives Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Wang Bijie, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, Wu Dingchang, Chen Cheng, Yu Youren, Zai Detu, and Zheng Lu were summoned by Chairman Chiang and had lunch at the official residence on Huangpu Road at 12:00 PM. The Chairman inquired about the situation of the talks with the mediators last night. The representatives reported the process and said that the oral proposal put forward by the mediators should be instructed by the Chairman. They left around 2:00 PM. At 5:30 PM, all the government representatives gathered again at Sun Ke's residence, and at 7:00 PM, Sun Ke hosted a banquet for all members of the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social elites, and held a meeting after the meal, which ended around 11:00 PM. After the meeting, reporters interviewed Lei Zhen and Luo Longji, who said that the crux of the dispute between the two sides still lies in the two points of ceasefire and the National Assembly list. The government's opinion is that the CCP should issue a ceasefire order after submitting the National Assembly list, but the CCP insists that the list can only be submitted according to the CPPCC procedures. This issue has been discussed for several hours tonight, and the mediators' contact with the Communist Party representatives and the Chairman's instructions to the government representatives have also focused on this point. In addition, some issues such as the reorganization of the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan are only a matter of timing. The government has no different opinion. It is reported that the mediators' oral proposal still includes ceasefire, National Assembly list, and reorganization of the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan. On the evening of the 30th, Luo Longji visited the Communist Party and asked them to consider the issue of submitting the National Assembly list, but today the Communist Party representatives still insisted on not handing it over when attending the talks. This is indeed a major reef in the current situation, but the mediators still want to continue their efforts and are scheduled to meet again at 10:00 AM on the 31st for discussion. When the reporter left the office of the Democratic League in Yunjiagang, it was already 12:00 midnight, and the night was hazy, like the confusing and uncertain future of the peace talks.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch on the 30th] Ambassador Stuart has recovered from his illness. He hosted a luncheon for Luce on the 30th, and invited Sun Ke to accompany him. In the afternoon, he went to pay respects to the Chairman with Fu Jingbo. The Chairman inquired about the Ambassador's health with great concern. The Ambassador also offered birthday wishes to the Chairman. It is reported that the peace talks were also discussed. He left at 5:00 PM and met with Marshal Ma for talks, returning to the embassy at 6:30 PM. Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party visited Fu Jingbo but did not speak. He then visited again at 7:00 PM and talked for half an hour before leaving.</p>

<h3>Sun Lianzhong Arrives in Zhuoxian; Pinghan Railway Under Urgent Repair</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Zhuoxian dispatch, 30th] Sun Lianzhong arrived in Zhuoxian again at 11:00 AM on the 30th for inspection. Currently, the front line of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is 15 li south of Beihe Store. The Beihe Store Bridge has been repaired, and a division of the National Army reinforcements has moved south. The National Army on the right flank is besieging Yi County. If that place is captured, the National Army can detour south along the mountains to relieve the siege of Baoding. The railway is currently being rushed to repair, and will soon reach Gaobeidian. After arriving in Zhuoxian on the 30th, Commander Sun entered the city briefly, summoned military and government personnel for instructions, and then left the city by truck for inspection. He may stay there for two or three days.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Beiping dispatch, 30th] Some of the National Army along the Ping-Sui Railway near Huailai has been transferred to reinforce the Ping-Mao line. Sun Lianzhong went to Zhuoxian again at 9:00 AM on the 30th for inspection. It is reported that he will set a deadline to open up the Ping-Bao and Bao-Shi lines. A major development in the war on the Pinghan Line is possible in three to five days. However, because the Communist army severely damaged the Pinghan Railway, the restoration of transportation is difficult to coordinate with military progress due to a lack of materials, which is a major headache for the authorities. It is reported that Sun Lianzhong's second visit to Zhuoxian was to urge the repair of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. Currently, the Pinghan Railway Bureau has divided the northern section into three sections for guerrilla urgent repair: (1) Changxindian section, (2) Baoding section, (3) Shijiazhuang section. Each section is allocated two construction trains for urgent repairs. The Railway Bureau stated that the amount of track removed by the Communist army has not yet been statistically determined. Approximately tens of thousands of destroyed sleepers were burned, and damage to the roadbed accounts for more than 30% of the jurisdiction. Among them, about 10 kilometers of roadbed between Songlindian and Gaobeidian are all continuous deep pits on the left and right, or the rails have been moved to both sides of the road, and many sleepers have been burned. The situation in Gaobeidian to Gucheng is unclear because it is under the control of the Communist army. The water tower, station building, and switch houses in Gaobeidian have all been bombed or burned. Between Gucheng and Caohe, most of the rails are gone. The Shuishui station water tower has been bombed, and the track maintenance crew house and station building have also been reduced to ashes. The Guhe turnout has also been dismantled, and the station building and track maintenance crew house are all in ruins. The Communist army removed all ten kilometers of rail between Shijiazhuang and Fangshun Bridge. The same is true for the forty kilometers between Wangdu and Zhaixidian. The track maintenance crew houses and station buildings in Wangdu and Qingfengdian have all been razed to the ground. It is estimated that the damaged length accounts for 180 kilometers, accounting for three-fifths of the total length. Currently, the construction train of the Changxindian Engineering Section has progressed to 82 kilometers, and it is expected to reach Gaobeidian. The situation between Gaobeidian and Caohe, which are still within the Communist army's sphere of influence, cannot be statistically determined. As for bridges, the total length is 50,000 meters, and 1,000 meters have been damaged, accounting for a little over 3% of the total length. Track maintenance crews and civilian laborers have been mobilized for urgent repairs. In addition to purchasing materials, the Railway Bureau's existing materials are also being used. There is also a method of collecting materials on the spot with rewards. Those who bring a steel rail can get 5,000 yuan. Larger beams need to be manufactured at the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory, and those under two meters can be matched with old materials from the engineering section. However, the bridge foundations of the Shahe Bridge and Xinjiutang Bridge have also been completely destroyed, and temporary ferries and pontoon bridges are temporarily used instead.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Celebrating Longevity and Serving the Country</h3>
<p>Today is the sixtieth birthday of Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Republic of China. Compatriots across the country universally celebrate, both near and far, with sincerity. Although Chairman Chiang has great virtue and humility and strictly forbids extravagance, the people in various places, based on their respect for virtue and gratitude for merit, either donate money to build schools or offer birthday congratulations, matters that are extraordinary and feelings that are difficult to suppress. This is truly because the Chairman has dedicated his life to the revolution and has made contributions to the country. Now, after the victory of the Great War, coinciding with the head of state's sixtieth year, those who celebrate the Chairman's longevity are celebrating for the country and for the people. The Chairman has contributed infinitely to the country and the people, and what will the people use to repay the Chairman? Therefore, today's celebration of longevity, the more the Chairman humbly declines, the more the people love and respect him. We can almost say that today's celebration of longevity by the people is a symbol of the people expressing their patriotism.</p>
<p>Speaking of serving the country, that is the Chairman's lifelong aspiration. We remember that the Chairman published the grand article "Serving the Country and Thinking of Relatives" on his fiftieth birthday, which truly moved everyone who read it and inspired them. Now, on his sixtieth birthday, the Chairman telegraphed the day before yesterday and said, "Today, the country is not yet at peace for a long time, and compatriots are suffering deeply," and he expressed his extreme self-deprecation, saying, "I am deeply ashamed for not fulfilling my duties to protect the country and save the people." When we recall that the Chairman, since he went to study abroad at the age of nineteen, vowed to follow the National Father and devote himself to the National Revolution, until today, with his vigorous spirit, leading the struggle, he has served the country for at least forty years in these sixty years, except for his youth, and he still always thinks of "serving the country and saving the people" and worries about "the country not being at peace for a long time and the people suffering." This selfless spirit of serving the country is what every descendant of the Yellow Emperor should cherish and emulate. Today, although our people use all possible means to respectfully celebrate the Chairman's great birthday, it is not even a fraction of the Chairman's spirit of serving the country; and our people must not only celebrate longevity but forget to serve the country. Because serving the country is everyone's duty, and only when everyone truly serves the country can we comfort the Chairman's long-cherished wish and repay the Chairman's merits.</p>
<p>The Chairman's sixty years of life, forty years devoted to the country; and his forty years of history of serving the country, the first half was to obey the leadership of the National Father, loyal to his duties, and the second half was to inherit the will of the National Father and complete the great cause. Today we celebrate the Chairman's longevity and pray for China's fortune. China unfortunately suffered the double humiliation of the last century of the Qing Dynasty, but China is also fortunate to have the National Father in the past and the Chairman in the present as the saviors of the country and the nation! Let us imagine; if China did not have the National Father, how could there have been the overthrow of the imperial system and the creation of the Republic of China? If China did not have the Chairman, how could there have been the success of the Northern Expedition and the victory of the War of Resistance? Without the former, there is no way to inspire the latter; without the latter, there is no way to glorify the former. Today, we respectfully celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday, and we should also greatly celebrate for China - celebrating that God blesses China and gives birth to great men.</p>
<p>But we only celebrate longevity verbally, and we only pray for blessings in words, which is not enough, and is not enough to express respect for virtue and gratitude for merit even by a fraction. We must contribute our strength and serve the country according to our ability, to share the Chairman's worries and labor. Only then can we truly celebrate the Chairman's longevity and pray for the country's blessings in the best way. Because the Chairman is after all sixty years old, he has fulfilled his forty-year responsibility to serve the country. He has shouldered the heavy burden of revolution and resistance, and he has carried the footsteps of the National Father for twenty long years. Of course, the Chairman is healthy and vigorous, leading the nation-building, and is admired by all, but the Chairman always hopes that the Republic of China can truly be built up, and that the people can truly become the masters of their own country, so that the country he "protects" can become a "republic" of "long-term peace," and that the people he "saves" can become "citizens" who are without "suffering" and capable of self-governance. The United States has Washington and the country was created, and it has Lincoln and the country was unified. The two great men, Washington and Lincoln, are immortal for all time, and the American people also enjoy infinite happiness. We are fortunate to have the National Father Sun Yat-sen and the country was created, and we also hope to rely on Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to unify the country. What the Chairman has been looking forward to day and night is that there will be such a day when he can see the country he has worked hard to save, from political tutelage to constitutional government, from party rule to democracy, and from his own hands, on behalf of the Kuomintang of China, to return the government to the people of the whole country. Twenty years ago, the Chinese people needed the Chairman's leadership. The Chairman did not refuse and resolutely led the people, first the Northern Expedition, which completed the unification, and then the War of Resistance, which guaranteed independence. Now we still look up to the Chairman's leadership, and he will surely lead us to complete the work of peaceful unification and democratic nation-building. However, we guess that the Chairman may think that during the period of political tutelage, he could not but lead the people according to the Three Principles of the People of the Party, but in the period of constitutional government, he expects that the people who believe in the Three Principles of the People will lead the country on the road of construction themselves. We must know that the success of democratic politics can never rely on the power of one person, but relies on the cooperative power of all the people, at least the majority of the people. The Chairman knows the essence of democracy and therefore expects the people to be sincerely. Today, the way for our people to serve the country according to their ability is also the way to repay the Chairman's merits. There is nothing else, as long as everyone does their best and fully cooperates to complete the work of peaceful unification and to establish the political and economic system of the Three Principles of the People, so that the Republic of China truly becomes a modern democratic country of the people, by the people, for the people.</p>
<p>We share the Chairman's worries and labor, but do not increase the Chairman's worries and labor, so that we can truly celebrate the Chairman's longevity. Only in this way, we must work hard according to our ability, learn to be citizens of a democratic country, and everyone contributes their strength to serve the country, so that we can share the Chairman's worries and labor, so that the Chairman can fulfill his long-cherished wish and see a new China that is democratic, unified, and strong, stand firm and shoulder the great responsibility of safeguarding world peace and maintaining human justice.</p>
<p>Congratulations on Chairman Chiang's health and happiness! Pray for the country's peaceful unification!</p>

<h3>Large Number of Economic Traitors in Bengbu; Evidence Found in Secret Chamber; Those Who Evade Justice Will Be Reported</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Bengbu dispatch] During the period of Bengbu's occupation, many of the traitors who joined the enemy were prominent figures in society in the past. There were many political traitors, but also many economic traitors. The most prominent among those who relied on the power of the enemy to disrupt finance and engage in conspicuous evil was the traitor Chuan Junshi, followed by the traitor Chen Xiping. At the beginning of the victory, the two traitors fled at the same time, and other second- and third-class traitors evaded justice, either staying in Bengbu or traveling between Yanzhou and Xuzhou, and have not yet been sanctioned by the country. Unexpectedly, personnel from a certain agency recently discovered a large secret chamber at the site of the former Anmin Bank on Er Ma Road and seized a large amount of evidence of economic traitors' adherence to the enemy. After the reporter's investigation, it was learned that the important figures in the former Anmin Bank were: Puppet Chairman Fu Cheng, Standing Directors Zhou Wenrui, Li Huilong, Directors Xu Ziping, Dai Nanxun, Chen Xiping, Cheng Bohang, Alternate Directors Zhang Bingqing, Yang Dingwen, and Yu Youfang. Shan Zhimin and Ni Duci (namely Ni Daolang), Zhang Jinjing, representatives of the Huaxing Bank, served as supervisors, and He Youwu served as an alternate supervisor. The shareholders included Liu Shanzhi, Wang Zhongzhang, Zhang Huichuan, etc., all with solid evidence. According to those familiar with the local situation, the puppet Anmin Bank was actually incubated by the puppet Huaxing Bank. Puppet Director Dai Nanxun was a mining tycoon, and Liu Shanzhi was a leather industry magnate. When Bengbu was occupied, Liu opened the Guangxing Leather Factory and the Huachang Military Uniform Factory, specializing in supplying military materials for the enemy. It is reported that part of his property has been confiscated, and there are still many omissions. Wang Zhongzhang was the president of the puppet National Medicine Industry Association and a well-known profiteer who made a fortune from the national crisis. A certain party has prepared to report to the court according to law, and the traitors will be severely sanctioned.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Requests Allocation of Warships to Protect Fisheries and Eliminate Pirates</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 30th] There are many pirates along the coast of Zhejiang. These are mostly scattered soldiers or remaining vagrants who took to the sea with weapons, specializing in robbing merchant ships and fishing boats. This has caused merchants and fishermen much concern. With the winter fishing season approaching, the fishing boats the provincial government intends to prepare are still being negotiated or repaired and cannot be used immediately. Therefore, the Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau recently sent a letter to the provincial government, requesting the Ministry of the Navy to allocate warships to cooperate with existing fishery protection vessels in jointly preventing banditry to facilitate navigation and benefit fishermen and merchants.

<h3>Suzhou to Impose Curfew Starting Tomorrow, Establishment of Wuxian County Bandit Suppression District Command to Strictly Eliminate Bandit Traces Inside and Outside the City</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, This Newspaper] Suzhou will strictly enforce a curfew starting at 00:00 on November 1st, with the curfew lasting from 00:00 to 06:00. However, passengers arriving in Suzhou on the Nanjing-Zhenjiang night train after midnight will be given special consideration. During the night train's arrival time in Suzhou, passengers will be temporarily allowed to pass from the station to the main road outside Liumen Gate to find lodging.

It is heard that the winter defense period is tentatively set for three months, from November 1, 1946, to January 31, 1947, but may be extended if necessary depending on the local security situation to ensure that there is no possibility of remnants of bandits resurfacing in various rural areas after the suppression.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, This Newspaper] The Yangcheng District Bandit Suppression Command stated that since the launch of the bandit suppression work in the Yangcheng District by the East and West District Commands, all bandit gangs that had been roaming within its jurisdiction have been almost completely eliminated.

<h3>Molotov Suggests to the United Nations General Assembly Universal Disarmament and Prohibition of the Use of Atomic Energy in War</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 29th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly tonight lasting one hour and eight minutes, first elaborated on the Soviet Union's far-reaching foreign policy and then unexpectedly launched a diplomatic offensive, proposing four resolutions to strengthen world peace. (1) The United Nations General Assembly considers universal disarmament necessary. (2) The first task is to prohibit the production of atomic energy for use in war. (3) The General Assembly recommends to the Security Council that it take practical measures in this regard. (4) The General Assembly requests all governments to support these measures. Molotov's speech was translated into French. Many delegates had already left the room. Molotov requested that debate on the disarmament resolution begin. After British delegate Bevin suggested that the issue be studied by the Joint Committee before further discussion, Molotov agreed. The General Assembly then adjourned until tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press, 29th] Molotov, in his speech to the UN General Assembly tonight, used blunt language, first stating that if the veto power enjoyed by the five major powers were strictly limited, the UN organization would inevitably collapse. Molotov then attacked Churchill and Baruch, the representative of the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Committee, before proposing a global disarmament movement, demanding an investigation into the number of troops stationed in non-enemy countries by the United Nations, especially the United States and Britain, and declaring his willingness to provide a detailed report on such Soviet troops. Molotov's speech was delivered to a packed hall, with all listening attentively, and when he proposed a general disarmament plan, he was greeted with warm applause. Molotov claimed that Churchill and many of his British and American friends were engaged in an anti-Soviet movement in the hope of creating an international hegemony. The atomic energy control plan proposed by Baruch was nothing more than self-serving.</p>
<p>Molotov pointed out that the Security Council's resolutions on the Spanish and Iranian cases were major errors, and that there are currently two conflicting political trends in the world: one is peace and cooperation by mutual agreement, and the other is control of other countries. The Soviet Union has always been committed to international cooperation, firmly respects the United Nations organization, and believes that the United Nations Charter must be faithfully implemented without change. Commenting on the recent visit of US warships to the Mediterranean, Molotov said that warships and aircraft sometimes travel to places they have never been before, believing that this is necessary to strengthen their diplomatic means. Atomic bombs have only been dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima and have not been tried elsewhere, but atomic bombs will inevitably be found in other countries, and all illusions will be shattered.</p>
<p>Molotov also criticized the existence of not only atomic diplomacy but also financial diplomacy and pound diplomacy, attempting to manipulate other countries with them. In some schemes, atomic bombs occupy the majority of the relationship, but Marshal Stalin has already said that the secret of atomic bombs cannot be kept forever, and atomic bombs cannot solve everything. It is regrettable that Churchill and his ilk, with their inherent reactionary ideas, still rely on force and control. If we can learn from the lessons of war, we must work together to deal with aggressors, and the United Nations organization must be made to become a place where major powers can unite to deal with any aggression. The unity of major powers in the Security Council has been recognized by the United Nations organization, and this principle cannot be undermined.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, Lake Success, 29th] United States Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission Baruch said today that the United States is prepared to accept Molotov's proposal to abolish atomic bombs and destroy existing stockpiles. At the same time, the US government pointed out that Molotov's proposal for world disarmament is welcome and attractive in principle. However, Baruch said the United States must first know that other countries have banned the manufacture of atomic bombs, and the United States wants to know the details of the Soviet Union's plan before implementing disarmament. Government officials stated: They are willing to leave Molotov's proposal to be answered by the US representative to the United Nations, Austin, but said that the United States has been demanding and working towards disarmament for ten years.</p>
<h3>US Troops Stationed in China with Our Consent, Our Delegation Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 30th Broadcast: The Chinese delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly today supported the United States in opposing Belarus's accusation that the stationing of US Marines in China violated the United Nations Charter. Belarus's accusation was made at the United Nations General Assembly. The Chinese delegation said in a statement: "China completely disagrees with the views of the Belarusian delegation. The whole world knows that the stationing of US troops in China was agreed upon by China, and their mission was to disarm Japanese troops and repatriate Japanese military and civilians in China. As this mission is gradually completed in various parts of China, US troops are also gradually being reduced and withdrawn to their home country, with only a few remaining in China. US troops have never participated in any conflicts between the National Army and the Communist Army. On the contrary, the US representative in China is working hard to promote a peaceful solution to political difficulties, which China must appreciate. These difficulties are caused by the Chinese Communist Party's opposition to the government's policy of unifying the country and its desire to expand its political system by force to control the whole of China."</p>
<h3>National Harmony, Universal Harmony, the Chinese Family System Can Be Learned From, Guo Taiqi Broadcasts Speech in the United States</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 29th Special Dispatch] Guo Taiqi, the second representative of our delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, recently broadcast to the American people on the Mutual Broadcasting System, which is relayed by more than 350 stations, calling on all countries in the world to adopt the traditional Chinese family concept of unity to develop the spirit of Chinese family harmony. Guo was the second of the special speakers from the five major powers at the United Nations General Assembly. The first speaker was Mrs. Roosevelt of the US delegation. At the beginning of the broadcast, the US Air Force Band played the Chinese national anthem, followed by Guo's speech. He said that the traditional Chinese family concept ideally involves five generations living together. Although there are inevitable frictions, harmony can still be maintained. This family spirit of harmony developed by all countries will definitely guarantee that all nations in the world will move together towards the same goal of the United Nations, which is to promote the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<h3>Britain Does Not Support Outer Mongolia's Request</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th] Regarding the recent letter from Outer Mongolian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Choibalsan to the Secretariat of the Council of Foreign Ministers, requesting to participate in the Far Eastern Commission, the British Foreign Office announced that the British government is unlikely to support this request.</p>
<h3>British Warships Violate Territorial Waters</h3>
<p>Albania Lodges Complaint</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 30th Broadcast: The Albanian representative complained to the United Nations General Assembly today that two British warships entered Albanian territory on October 22, containing a threatening nature.</p>
<h3>The Issue of the Veto Power of the Five Major Powers Remains the Focus of Debate at the United Nations General Assembly, the US Delegation Drafts a Restriction Plan</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 30th Broadcast: The United Nations General Assembly entered its second week today, and the focus of discussion remains the veto power issue. Molotov's proposal to reduce armaments in all countries does not reduce the debate among representatives on the veto power. As of today, of the 51 national representatives, 29 have addressed the General Assembly, and 23 of them (including four of the five major powers) have discussed the veto power. As many as 13 small countries have criticized the veto power, and these representatives have requested that the use of the veto power be restricted or completely abolished. As for those who oppose changing the veto power, there are nine countries: Britain, France, China, the Soviet Union, Belarus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Canada, and Syria.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 29th] In order to avoid being seen as ganging up with Britain to deal with the Soviet Union, the United States is drafting a detailed plan to restrict the five major powers from exercising their veto power in the Security Council. The main points are as follows: (1) Expand the existing rules of procedure to prohibit any of the five permanent members from participating in the Security Council's judgment on cases related to that country itself. (2) Allow any of the five countries to voluntarily waive their right to vote without being considered to have exercised the veto power. (3) Fully distinguish between procedural issues (requiring a simple majority vote) and substantive issues (requiring the unanimous agreement of all five permanent members) discussed by the Security Council. If this plan cannot be agreed upon, it will inevitably lead to a long and heated debate in the Security Council.</p>
<p>However, although this plan is still awaiting last-minute revisions, it is heard that it will be informally submitted to the four countries of China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France here for their opinions before being submitted to the United Nations General Assembly subcommittee for discussion. When US chief representative Austin delivers a speech at the General Assembly tomorrow, he will formally present the above plan. Austin's speech will avoid political issues and will only be limited to matters within the purview of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>The World Food Preparatory Committee, Our Representative Delivers a Speech Suggesting Guaranteeing Sufficient World Grain Reserves</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] Chen Qimai, the leader of the Chinese delegation to the World Food Committee Preparatory Committee, said to the representatives today: The current arduous task of the Chinese government and the Chinese people is agricultural revival. Therefore, the Chinese government expresses its "sincere" welcome to the Food and Agriculture Organization's proposal to establish an international organization to guarantee sufficient world grain reserves and maintain stable prices. Chen also said: China attaches great importance to the proposal to create international warehouses.</p>
<h3>The World YWCA Board of Directors to Meet in China Next Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] A reporter from the World YWCA Preparatory Committee said that the association's Board of Directors will hold a meeting in China in October next year.</p>
<h3>US President Truman's Proclamation Specifies Armistice and Thanksgiving Days</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] President Truman issued a proclamation today, designating November 11 as Armistice Day and November 28 as Thanksgiving Day, and asked the people of the country to renew their efforts to seek lasting peace. The President advocated that Armistice Day should have appropriate ceremonies, and US government offices must fly the national flag uniformly.</p>
<h3>Different Methods of Calculating the Number of Soviet Troops</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] Stalin denied Churchill's claim that the Soviet Union had 100 divisions stationed in Europe in a speech yesterday, saying that the Soviet Union only had 60 divisions stationed in these countries. The diplomatic correspondent of the "Daily Mail" commented today that Marshal Stalin's so-called 60 divisions may include 50,000 personnel per division, which would amount to a total of 3 million personnel. As for Churchill's estimate of 200 divisions, each division only includes 10,000 personnel, which would amount to a total of only 2 million personnel. This conclusion proves the difficulty of the issue, which is why the official expressed sincerity.</p>
<h3>Churchill Responds to Stalin, Willing to Resolve British-Soviet Suspicions and Make Peace, Hoping to Disclose Troop Numbers to Remove Doubts</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 29th] Former Prime Minister Churchill issued a statement tonight, sternly refuting Marshal Stalin's claim that the Soviet Union only has 60 divisions stationed in Europe, saying that this number "does not include Romania, and certainly does not include the heavy troops concentrated in Leningrad and Odessa." However, two hours later, Churchill deleted this sentence without explaining the reason. Churchill's move was apparently due to not having read the full text of Stalin's speech, as Stalin's reference to 60 divisions stationed abroad actually included Romania. Churchill's statement this time was moderate in tone, which was rare in his previous remarks to the Soviet Union. It is said that I was very pleased to hear Stalin's statement about the Soviet army. The British-Soviet treaty concluded during my tenure as Prime Minister in 1941 stipulated non-interference in each other's internal affairs and social systems. Therefore, I do not know why we cannot become friends, helping each other and improving the overall living standards of the broad masses everywhere. I express my respect for Stalin and wish the Soviet people safety, glory, and happiness. As for my saying that the Soviet Union has 200 divisions stationed in various occupied areas, the British government has not corrected it. We have had our fill of all kinds of suspicions, and there is no better way to dispel suspicions than facts. The United Nations organization and the Security Council should have the opportunity to fully and fairly disclose all troops to dispel doubts.</p>
<h3>The United States Believes Stalin's Remarks Provide a New Factor for Promoting Understanding</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] Today, Byrnes met with President Truman for nearly an hour, but it was not explained whether they had discussed Stalin's written speech. At the same time, world leaders, including President Truman, have closely studied Stalin's reply. Tonight, a copy of Stalin's answers to reporters was presented to Truman, and the President read it with great interest. State Department officials said that Stalin's answers to the questions raised by United Press manager Bailey showed that the Soviet Union might in the near future jointly establish economic unification in Germany with Britain and the United States, followed by the establishment of a provisional German government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] The State Department commented today on Marshal Stalin's remarks yesterday, saying that Stalin's hope for a unified Germany and the establishment of a satisfactory peace treaty was in response to Secretary of State Byrnes. Stalin's renewed attention to borrowing from the United States has caused considerable surprise. The State Department originally thought that the Soviet Union was no longer concerned about its $1 billion loan negotiation a year ago, but now it knows that this is not the case. Byrnes did not directly express his opinion on Stalin's remarks, and did not even criticize Stalin's rebuttal of Byrnes's point that US-Soviet relations are becoming increasingly tense.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 30th] General MacArthur, Acheson, and Lieutenant General Terevenko have all read Stalin's written remarks with great interest but refused to formally comment on them. Senior officials at MacArthur's headquarters informally expressed the opinion that the resolution of major disagreements between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union could have a good impact on local problems in Asia, including the Korean issue, where US-Soviet relations are most tense.</p>
<h3>Adapting to Modern National Defense Needs, France Improves Military Training System, Training Period Increased to Four Years, the Whole Country Can Become Elite Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] A spokesman for the French Army Department told reporters that the future France will be in a state of extremely perfect military preparedness. Although the compulsory military training system is limited by a small budget, the results have been very satisfactory since it was implemented in June. The pre-war system left those accustomed to civilian life unprepared, suddenly having to undergo a year of military training. The new system expands the training period to four years, and is greatly improved based on the lessons learned during the war, and maintains a close interweaving with civilian life, so that if war occurs again in the future, the people can fully help with combat. During World War II, regular troops could not stop the advance of German mechanized units, but guerrilla warfare could exert great effectiveness. If new atomic weapons are used in future wars, guerrilla warfare will have even broader applications. The new German military training system is divided into two phases: the first phase is three years of reserve military training, and all French youth between the ages of seventeen and twenty must be trained locally. In the first two years, the Army Department and the Ministry of Education jointly supervise and emphasize physical training. In the third year, the Army Department supervises independently, so that the training program is completely militarized. An examination is held at the end of the three-year initial training period to assess the results. The fourth year is the active military training period. Youths who have completed initial training are called up according to their grade level, and given physical and psychological tests based on the US Army military training system, and then, according to their results, are divided into classes and sent to military training centers for one year of training. In the first half of the year, basic training in common military science is given, and in the second half of the year, they are assigned to various special parts of the army, such as paratroopers, tanks, artillery, and supply units, for special training. After the training is completed, they are allowed to return to civilian life as reserves. Those with excellent results can enter military academies for further study. Those who are listed in the reserve series will be given refresher training every few years to ensure that they do not forget the military knowledge they have acquired and to instill the latest military knowledge.</p>

<p>(2) Lyrics by Yi Junzu: "Congratulations on the sixtieth birthday, listen to a chorus of joyful respect; rejoice that auspicious clouds gather over China, the weather is favorable and the harvest is abundant; nine years of bloody war rely on leadership, the smoke of war in several places has completely dissipated; having experienced hardships, he single-handedly turned the tide, fulfilling the revolutionary mission of national revival; prioritizing democracy and the people, wishing for peaceful unification and a stable foundation for the nation; the implementation of the Great Constitution will pave a smooth road, the four powers will join the ranks and shine brightly; long live China and may it last for ten thousand years, the whole world celebrates."</p>

Mei Lanfang, Tan Fuying, Yang Baosen, Zhou Xinfang, Li Shaochun, Yan Huizhu, Ye Shenglan, Ye Shengzhang, Lin Shusen, Zhao Ruquan, and others will all participate. The program includes (1) Peach Blossom Feast, (2) Nine Dragon Cups, (3) Complete Double Beauty Strange Fate, (4) Complete Dragon and Phoenix Bring Prosperity. Ticket prices range from 4,000 to 50,000 yuan. There are also 100 honorary seats, each costing 100,000 yuan. Today's program is exciting, and the supporting cast is complete, making it a rare grand event in Peking Opera. (Tickets are sold at three locations: Tianchan Stage, Chung Hwa Book Company, and the Longevity Hall of the Ningbo Fellow Association.) Furthermore, after participating in the charity performance to celebrate the birthday today, the Mei Troupe will begin performing at the China Grand Theater in the Three Cities tomorrow night. The opening play will be Mei Lanfang and Xiao Changhua's "Su San Qi Jie." Mr. Mei has not performed this play for over ten years because he has not found a suitable clown character to match him. Now that Mr. Xiao Changhua, a senior Peking Opera actor from the Hua Society who is over seventy years old, has actually come south, he will perform his masterpiece "Qi Jie" again. The peony and the green leaves complement each other perfectly. Mr. Mei will not perform for many more years, and Mr. Xiao Changhua is already old, so this play may become a swan song. It is said that Mr. Mei's other masterpieces, such as "Tan Mu," "Cosmic Peak," "Rainbow Pass," "Life and Death Hatred," and "Phoenix Returns Home," will also be performed one after another.</p>

<h3>Liu Gen Vigorously Accuses His Grand-Disciple of Crimes; Jing'an Temple Had a Secret Organization; Ejecting Benevolent Monks; Ousting the Weak; Befriending the Japanese; Monks Dewu and Mijia Accused of Enmity</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The case of Jing'an Temple Abbot Dewu and Supervisor Mijia, suspected of being traitors, was heard in the Second Criminal Court of the High Court at 9:30 AM yesterday. Many people attended the hearing, including thirty to forty monks, creating a unique scene with shaven heads filling the courtroom. The accusers, Liu Gen, Yang Xi, and Xie Xiqing, all appeared in court to testify, and the two defendants also argued. The hearing concluded at 12:15 PM. The court ordered that evidence still needs to be investigated, and adjourned for another hearing. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Dewu testified: "I am 27 years old, a native of Shanghai. I became a monk at the age of seven. In July of the 30th year of the Republic, I inherited the abbotship because my master Zhiwen passed away. Liu Gen is my grand-master. I was dismissed by Qi Xieyuan and Han Guojun in the 12th year of the Republic. Yang Xi was the supervisor when my master was in charge. Later, because he filed a lawsuit against my master, the local court revoked his title as supervisor. Mijia was originally the abbot of the Baiyi Temple in Ningbo. He came to Shanghai to seek refuge and lived in Jing'an Temple. I invited him to be the supervisor. Xie Xixiang was originally the owner of the Shiguang Bookstore in front of Jing'an Temple. The rented house belonged to the temple property. Because of the construction of the mountain gate and because the contract had expired, I paid him a moving fee of 3 million yuan and did not renew the lease. This accusation may be due to a grudge."</p>
<p>Mijia was then brought to the court. His defense was mostly the same as Dewu's testimony.</p>
<p>Three Accusers Testify to Crimes</p>
<p>The court then questioned the accuser Liu Gen, who was wearing old monk robes. He testified: "I am 62 years old, a local. I entered Jing'an Temple at the age of nine. I was originally the abbot, but I stopped being the abbot in the 12th year of the Republic. When Mijia came in, he drove me out. Dewu is my grand-disciple." The court asked why he accused Mijia. He replied: "Because he is a traitor. Mijia served as the executive director of the puppet Buddhist Association, and also founded the Tongpeng Japanese Language School. He also drove out the old, weak, and young monks in the temple, and took out the Yue Fei, Amitabha, and other bodhisattvas to sell for money. There is also a secret organization in Jing'an Temple, equipped with telephones and alarms. Many Japanese and Japanese women come and go, with great fanfare. Mijia is good to the Japanese and harsh to his own people."</p>
<p>Yang Xi, also wearing old monk robes, testified: "I am 67 years old, from Anhui. I was previously the supervisor of Jing'an Temple. The reason for the accusation is that Dewu, Mijia, and others occupied the temple property and befriended Japanese merchants Fujii Shizui and Kinoshita Bankei, and jointly ran a Japanese language night school. They also used the power of the puppet Buddhist Association to oppress me and drive me out of the country, wanting to put me to death."</p>
<p>Xie Xiqing said: "I originally ran a bookstore. The reason for the accusation is that the defendants and Japanese monks jointly ran the Tongpeng Japanese Language Night School, which was registered with the enemy embassy. The textbooks were transported from Japan and the puppet Manchukuo. They also participated in the Greater East Asia Memorial Service, serving as preparatory committee members and chanting masters. There are photos of them with enemy officers after the event and newspaper records to prove it."</p>

<h3>Tour of the Longevity Hall: A Giant Red Satin Curtain Embroidered with Qilin, Zhou Bronze Tripods, Shang Ritual Vessels, and Jade Ruyi Scepters</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai community's celebration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's sixtieth birthday will be held today at the Ningbo Native Association. To commemorate the Chairman's birthday and to express gratitude for his great achievements, the Ningbo Native Association's auditorium will be renamed "Zhongzheng Hall" from today onwards. This "Zhongzheng Hall" will also become a historic venue, where representatives of Shanghai's four million citizens will gather today to offer their birthday wishes. The decorations of the Longevity Hall will undoubtedly attract everyone's attention.</p>
<p>The Longevity Hall, arranged by the Ningbo Native Association, was freshly painted the day before yesterday and fully decorated by yesterday afternoon. A tall red and green archway was erected at the entrance, and a golden banner reading "Shanghai Community's Celebration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Birthday" was hung in front of the second-floor balcony. Particularly eye-catching were the two large pillars wrapped in red silk on either side of the entrance. Upon entering the hall, one immediately felt enveloped in an atmosphere of joyous red. The walls and pillars were adorned with red and green cloth drapes, featuring national emblem patterns, longevity character patterns, and various other designs. Twenty lanterns of various styles were hung on the walls. Pink, light green, rose red, and light blue silk ribbons were suspended crisscross in the air. Amidst the colors filled with Chinese sentiment, every small decoration contained the meaning of "joy." On the main wall of the Longevity Platform hung a large red satin curtain presented to the Chairman, embroidered with qilin and flowers. On the two curtains on either side were embroidered goldfish. A neon light was placed in front of the curtain, with a red "寿" (longevity) character inside a large peach. Above the Longevity Table hung a crimson silk cloth with four golden characters: "萬壽無疆" (May you live ten thousand years).</p>
<p>The Longevity Table itself was quite interesting! It was entirely in the Ningbo style, magnificent and varied. The first row consisted of four tin implements: a candlestick and two incense stands, backed by a small, colorful neon archway about three feet high. On either side of the rectangular table were seven pairs of longevity candles, a Ningbo custom to wish for a seventieth birthday. The tin candle holders were also of various designs, featuring cranes, deer, harmony, and the five blessings encompassing longevity. Also arranged on the table was a jade ruyi scepter; and four plates of cakes, peaches, candles, and noodles, arranged like large cones. In addition, there were a pair of red congratulatory glass items, silver三星上壽 (Three Stars Bestowing Longevity), 八仙慶壽 (Eight Immortals Celebrating Longevity), Zhou tripods, Shang tripods, yi (ritual vessel), he (ewer), and dui (covered bowl) bronze vessels. Six cups of longevity tea were filled with longan, black dates, and lotus seeds. In addition, there was also a pair of colorful flower longevity candles. The nine pairs of longevity candles on the platform today were prepared by the birthday celebration preparatory committee from various sectors. The largest pair of flower-decorated longevity candles weighed more than ten pounds and was donated by Yuan Fengshun Candle Shop.</p>
<p>Since the Ningbo Native Association's auditorium has been renamed "Zhongzheng Hall," the first item on today's birthday celebration program is the unveiling ceremony of "Zhongzheng Hall." The golden plaque was inscribed by Zhang Chuanbao, a seventy-year-old former Qing dynasty licentiate. Before the unveiling, the plaque was covered with a yellow and red silk curtain, and nine red and yellow ribbons were hung, ready for Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, and six county elders (Tong Weibin of 鄞县, Qin Runqing of 慈谿, Li Yongshang of 鎮海, Sun He of 奉化, Zhang Jiezhou of 象山, and Zhu Zikui of 定海) to use for the unveiling. Among them, Mr. Tong Weibin is over eighty years old this year.</p>

<h3>Cotton Merchants' Inventory: Less Than 100,000 Dan, Carding Industry Inventory Sufficient, Cotton Spinning and Refining Not Fully Reported</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Cotton Merchants' Association was ordered to investigate the cotton inventory of its members and completed the task yesterday. A total of 103 member companies registered with the association. The total registered cotton inventory was 90,987 dan and 11 jin. According to the person in charge of the association speaking to a reporter: this inventory is only a small fraction of what it was before the incident. It is said that the association has a total of 147 member companies. However, in recent months, 10% have applied to withdraw from the association, and the association is currently investigating the reasons for withdrawal. Another 20-30% are not engaged in the cotton business, and their operations are purely at a standstill. Most cotton merchants have weak capital and cannot withstand the oppression of high-interest loans. Furthermore, the purchase of domestic cotton is hindered by difficult transportation, and the price of cotton in the production areas is too high, making it difficult to transport. As for foreign cotton, purchases have stopped since the Central Bank stopped supplying foreign exchange in May of this year. Therefore, the cotton inventory in the hands of members is extremely limited. As domestic cotton enters the market, it is hoped that the government will assist in procurement to maintain textile raw materials and avoid wasting foreign exchange. The association has also recently investigated that in the local cotton carding industry, there are many merchants engaged in the raw cotton trade with considerable scale. Their cotton inventory is no less than that of the cotton merchants. Therefore, to take factual considerations into account, these merchants have been encouraged to join the association as members. It is reported that investigations have been completed, and the merchants intending to join include Longxing, Yuda, Jinshunxing, Xinyixing, Gongyixing, Qiao Xiaomao, Yuanlong, Xu Yongnian, and eight others.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District is processing the registration of cotton inventories from member factories. As of yesterday, only half have registered, totaling just over ten companies. It is planned to urge the rest to report within two or three days before submitting a report to Mayor Wu.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Negotiates Adjustment of Flour Prices, Flour Mills Resume Operations Today, Price Set at 20,500 Yuan Per Bag, Daily Distribution of 12,000 Bags Starting November 1st</h3>

Representatives included Zhu [name]qiu of Yutong Flour Mill, Hua [name]xiaqing, Fu [name]deqi, Rong Yiren of Maoxin, Qian Shouchun of Fuxin, Feng Rongchu of the Flour Trade Association, Zhang Chao of the Flour Bran Association, and more than 20 representatives from food companies such as Ma Baoshan of the Qiemian Industry, the Bingman Industry, and the Gaotuan Industry and Taikang. Mayor Wu stated that the production of domestic wheat in the provinces near Shanghai could be supplied to the city as much as possible. As for American wheat, 20,000 tons are expected to arrive soon. Before the arrival of American wheat, the flour industry should jointly maintain the status quo, factories should resume operations, and finished products should not increase in price. Then, the issue of price negotiation was discussed and it was decided that the manufacturers' selling price would be 19,700 yuan, plus a commodity tax of 300 yuan, for a total of 20,000 yuan per bag. The flour mills will directly deliver this flour to the Flour Trade Association for distribution to various finished product industries, allowing a transportation fee of 300 yuan and a profit of 200 yuan, for a total of 500 yuan, i.e. a distribution price of 20,500 yuan. Starting November 1st, distribution will be made according to the quantity applied for by each industry, with a daily distribution of 12,000 bags. The various industries are not allowed to increase the price of their products or reduce the size of the finished products. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.

<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Rise, Raw Oil Rises Another 5,000-6,000</h3>

Japonica rice continued to rise by 1,000 yuan, and indica rice continued to rise by 2,000 yuan. White rice and Yin rice also increased by 1,000-2,000 yuan. The Min rice faction's purchasing of yellow soybeans slackened, and the market softened. Raw oil from the Ningbo area was active in both areas. Inventories were low, and prices soared by 5,000-6,000 yuan. However, soybean oil, rapeseed oil, and clear oil, etc., were still supplied by the manufacturers, and prices were relatively stable. Sesame oil also had little fluctuation. Wheat was scarce and firm. Sesame seeds were up 1,000-2,000 yuan. Cowpeas rose by 1,000 yuan.

The price was set at 80,000 yuan per dan, and the South Products Trade Association would prepare the funds to claim the sugar and distribute it.</p>
<h3>Fuel Committee to Implement Adjusted Coal Prices Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The supply of coal in this city is vast. It is under the unified planning and distribution of the Shanghai Fuel Committee. The original prices were divided into three categories. Coal used by public utilities and government agencies adopted a subsidy method, subsidized by the authorities. Therefore, its distribution price was originally twice as low as that of coal used by factories. The bureau has been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to adjust the distribution price of the above two types of coal, starting tomorrow, increasing it by one fold according to the original price. The distribution price of coal after adjustment is as follows.</p>
<p>(1) For public utilities, railways, military and public relief transportation, and power plants in other cities, 90,000 yuan per ton (Shanghai Electric Power Company 60,000 yuan per ton, Water Supply Company 65,000 yuan per ton, but water fees and lighterage fees are at their own expense). (2) Ordinary shipping and government agencies, 100,000 to 150,000 yuan per ton (depending on the coal grade). (3) The price of coal for factories remains the same as the distribution price on August 14, ranging from 140,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan per ton (depending on the coal grade).</p>
<h3>Market Demand Suddenly Increases, Gold Prices Rise by 50,000, Central Bank Supplies Without Limitation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere was very vibrant, and demand was unusually strong. The opening price in the morning was around 2.285 million. After the opening, it rose from 2.281 million, and demand exceeded supply. Soon, it broke through the big barrier of 2.3 million and gradually improved. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank distributed 100 bars at a price of 2.3325 million. After that, demand became even more intense. Even with supply, it did not have much impact, and the price rose to over 2.38 million. Therefore, the Central Bank issued an order for unlimited supply, and the price immediately fell. At noon, it struggled within 2.33 million. In the afternoon, people were still eager, and the next day's transactions rose back to over 2.34 million. As a result, it rose 52,000 compared to the previous closing price. Gold jewelry in silver shops rose to 2.48 million. Silver taels did not change. Silver dollars rose slightly. The informal short-term money market was slightly tighter, with informal interest rates standing at around 1.5%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were inconvenient to move and only rose slightly. The market price of American dollars was still 3,500 yuan for buying and 3,530 yuan for selling, without any activity. The price in the informal market was around 4,200 yuan, but it was inconvenient to move. In the end, it only rose slightly. Hong Kong dollars were stimulated by the gold market, and the Shanghai Exchange rate shrunk slightly. Yesterday, it stood at around 905. In the end, it rose 10 yuan compared to the previous closing price. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 905 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 1,095 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 14,400 yuan. There was supply for all, but the volume of transactions was not high. The official exchange rate of the American dollar did not change, but trading was quiet.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Extremely Weak, Fine Yarn Continues to Rise by 50,000</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The yarn market was extremely mediocre yesterday. The supply of ready-made Gan Branch Yarn was relatively abundant, but sales to customers were still sluggish, resulting in a general drop of 10,000 to 40,000 for each brand below the special Shuangma. However, the Daflying Boat Factory temporarily had no arrivals, and customers from Jiangxi were actively seeking it, which uniquely rose by 20,000. Ready-made 42-count yarn continued to rise by 50,000 with the additional distribution from weaving mills, while 32-count fine yarn turned flat.</p>
<p>The cloth market was even more depressed. The number of transactions was very few, and it was like a market closure. The Fangjian repeatedly opened, but few applicants. The finished products of private factories also piled up in considerable quantities. If the market does not improve, manufacturers will be forced to stop work to tide over the difficulties. Yesterday, Fangjian opened a fine cloth leader, losing 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan, but no one purchased it. This shows a glimpse of the market clearing. The spot price of fine cloth leaders was 15,000 yuan, and the opening price of color ball fine cloth was 79,000 yuan. The price of other cloths did not increase or decrease.</p>
<h3>Businesses Prohibited from Using Company Names, Business Registration Deadline Today, Violators Will Be Penalized</h3>
<p>Gu Bingyuan, the chief of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the bureau had previously received instructions from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stipulating that all businesses that use the name of a company without authorization should be investigated by the competent local authorities and ordered to publish in the newspaper to cancel the name of the company. In addition, they should be ordered to register a business in accordance with the law. Companies that have not yet registered should be ordered to register within a time limit. Those who refuse to comply will be punished in accordance with the Company Law, and they will still be ordered to register within a time limit and are not allowed to delay. After receiving the order, the Bureau announced it in the Central Daily News on August 26, stipulating that all companies that have not yet registered must complete the registration before the end of October of this year, and ordered the city's Chamber of Commerce to supervise compliance. Now that the deadline has passed, those who refuse to comply will be punished in accordance with the law. However, various companies in the recovered area should still verify their licenses and complete supplementary registration before the end of December of this year in accordance with the provisions of the Disposal Measures. Otherwise, the name of the company will become invalid in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Danyang Opens Yarn Factory with 20,000 Spindles and 1,000 Looms</h3>

<h3>Foreign Currency Business Licenses for Money Changers Expire at the End of This Month</h3>

The Central Bank authorities have unofficially indicated that in principle, they will allow them to continue to engage in foreign currency business, but the issue of renewing the licenses is still under consideration and will be renewed or discontinued separately.</p>
<h3>Hua Stocks Once Improved, But Wavered Again Before Closing</h3>
<p>Hua stocks were stimulated by news of settlements on delivery. The opening in the morning already showed a good scene. There was a scramble to buy after the opening, and the trading floor was unusually depleted. The price immediately rose. Retail investors were overly excited, and the price soon rose by nearly 5%. After the high point, it turned into a saw-toothed pattern. Banks slightly reduced their positions, but the market was unusually good. There was strong buying interest from outside the market, and there were many more increases. After 10:30 AM, it gradually became weak. Meiya first fell sharply. Yongs yarn and Xinhuo also took the opportunity to close. In the middle, Guang Bang and others withdrew and then re-entered. Although the price was low, there was a lot of consolidation. Later, it was heard that the Central Bank would supply unlimited amounts of gold, and people panicked again. Yongs yarn immediately scrambled to sell, retreating to within 710 yuan. Near noon, there was more panic, and it retreated into the big barrier of 700 yuan to end the day. Compared to the previous closing price, active stocks such as Yongs yarn, Xinhuo, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing rose slightly, while Meiya fell slightly. Except for Rongfeng Matches, Wuhe, and Jinglun, which fell slightly, all other cold stocks rose. There were even fewer transactions in the afternoon. There was more panic, so the demand slightly exceeded the supply. After consolidation, the situation was stable before closing, but it did not break free from the consolidation. In the end, compared to the previous closing price, active stocks such as Qinxing and Xinhuo each rose by half a percent. Yongs yarn, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang all rose slightly. Among the cold stocks, Gongsi, Jinglun, Wuhe, and Matches fell slightly, Zhongfang Underwear was flat, and the rest all rose slightly. The situation of each stock outside the market was stable.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were flat and consolidated. Each stock had its own ups and downs. Compared to the previous closing price, Yisha Paper and Navigation rose slightly, and Yisha Beer and Steel fell slightly. The rest were flat.</p>

<h3>Canadian Newspaper Raises Newsprint Price by Ten Dollars Per Ton</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Montreal, October 29] After the US Price Administration increased the price limit for US newsprint from $74 per ton to $84 per ton, the two major Canadian newsprint manufacturers, Abitibi Paper and International Paper, first increased the price of newsprint by $10 per ton. According to an International Paper official, the price increase applies to customers in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Therefore, the price of Canadian paper in Montreal is now $80 per ton, which is $4 lower than the price of US paper. The price of British paper is based on the US price, and there is generally little change.</p>
<h3>Mexican Silver Reaches New High Price</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Mexico City, October 29] According to the industry analysis report compiled by the National Bank of Mexico, the new silver price and the urgent demand for industrial supplies for construction in Europe have led to a new era of prosperity for the Mexican mining industry. The new silver price is 90.5 cents per ounce, almost twice the price of 45.5 cents per ounce several weeks ago, giving the silver mining industry generous profits. When the silver price increased from 45 cents to 71 cents, the government taxed 15.2 cents or 57.8 percent, labor received 7 cents or 26.8 percent, and capital only received 4 cents or 15.4 percent. This time, when the silver price increased again to 90.5 cents, the three parties shared equally, each receiving 33.3 percent.</p>

<h3>Today's Birthday Celebration Football Match: Tung Wah vs. British Navy Showdown, 3:30 PM at Recreation Ground, Ticket Revenue to Benefit Chiang Kai-shek Scholarship</h3>
<p>The Municipal Sports Association Football Committee, in celebration of its chairman's 60th birthday, has scheduled a celebratory football match for 3:30 PM today at the Recreation Ground. Tung Wah will face off against the British Navy team, which arrived in Shanghai the day before. Tickets, priced at 2,000 and 5,000 yuan, will be sold at the Municipal Gymnasium starting at 1:30 PM. The referee will be Chen Jixiang, with He Chunhui and Wu Shouheng as linesmen. The revenue, after deducting necessary expenses, will be donated to the Chiang Kai-shek Scholarship.</p>
<p>Tung Wah's lineup was announced yesterday by team captain Jia Youliang. Zhang Banglun is participating in the Sixth Corps' campaign in Taiwan, and Huang Kehou is injured and unable to play. Liu Xianhan will take over as goalkeeper, and Li Ning has decided to come out of retirement to assist in defense. On the forward line, veterans Dai Linjing and Sun Jinshun will don their jerseys once again. The rest of the team will be the same as when they played against Longjie.</p>
<p>Although Tung Wah will be missing Banglun and Kehou today, the addition of Liu Xianhan in goal should compensate for the loss in defense. The return of veterans Sun Jinshun and Dai will not only prevent any weakening but will also provide a significant boost. Center forward A-zai, supported by inside forwards Sun Jinshun and Han Longhai, and wingers Li Yao and Jia Youliang, represents Tung Wah's ideal forward lineup, promising a strong offensive showing.</p>

<h3>An Interview with the New President of Great China University, Mr. Yang Gongda</h3>
<p>— Jiang Feng</p>
<p>One morning, amidst the autumn wind and rain, the reporter, carrying an umbrella, accompanied Mr. Jiang, the head of the Agricultural Economics Society of Great China University, to visit the new president, Mr. Yang Gongda. Under Mr. Jiang's guidance, we quickly arrived at the gate of President Yang's residence in Bajiaokutou.</p>
<p>After knocking on the door and entering, we found ourselves in an old-fashioned small Western-style house in a church, neatly decorated. Upon entering, President Yang's attendant hurried down from upstairs and invited us to sit down in a simple, undecorated reception room. The attendant informed us that President Yang was not feeling well and was resting in bed, but Mr. Jiang requested to see President Yang and asked the attendant to convey his intentions. The attendant then hurried upstairs again.</p>
<p>We sat quietly in the reception room for a while, staring blankly at the drizzling autumn rain outside the window.</p>
<p>A Kind Elder</p>
<p>After a long while, we heard footsteps on the stairs, and we saw President Yang, a man of imposing stature, slowly descending the stairs. President Yang was wearing a dark blue suit and a pair of thick glasses. My first impression was that he was a kind elder!</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang first requested that the school authorities negotiate with the Ministry of Education to resume enrollment in the Department of Agricultural Economics. President Yang expressed very sincerely, "Resuming enrollment in the Department of Agricultural Economics is not only the hope of the students in the Department of Agricultural Economics, but also the hope of all the students in the school, and even more so my hope. Since it is everyone's unanimous hope, from the perspective of the president, from the perspective of the school, and from the perspective of the Department of Agricultural Economics, we should resume enrollment in the Department of Agricultural Economics and should not allow a department with more than half of the students in the College of Agriculture to suddenly be interrupted. However, since we have already notified the examination areas to suspend enrollment, we must request an expansion of enrollment from the Ministry of Education. We will discuss this with the professors tomorrow and then make a decision. If possible, we can resume enrollment at the same time as the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences."</p>
<p>Because President Yang was suffering from some asthma and we saw that he was not feeling well, the reporter originally intended to leave without disturbing him further. However, President Yang spoke with the sincerity of a parent talking to his children about everyday matters, so we took the opportunity to raise the issue of building a new Great China University.</p>
<p>His Wife Cannot Endure Hardship</p>
<p>"Great China University is a school that was established during wartime and has the shortest history of all the universities in the country." President Yang quickly continued without hesitation, "Moreover, Jinhua is just too poor a place. These are unspeakable difficulties. For example, when inviting professors, the professor himself agrees to come, but his wife may not be able to endure the hardship, so she is afraid to come, and as a result, even the professor does not come. I have already mentioned this at the welcome tea party for the students who stayed at the school that day. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is not yet open to traffic in Jinhua, and transportation is inconvenient, so no one is happy to come. Therefore, when I arrived in Shanghai, I managed to borrow money and buy a jeep. In the future, as soon as a professor arrives at Zhuji Station, as long as we are notified by the school, we can immediately send a jeep to pick him up. At the same time, I also hope to buy another large truck to pick up and drop off students and solve the students' transportation difficulties."</p>
<p>Although President Yang's voice was quite low, his enthusiasm for talking was even greater, leaving us with practically no room to interject.</p>
<p>Cooperate Towards New Life</p>
<p>"Therefore, I feel that if we want to run Great China University well in Jinhua, the most important thing is to improve the environment and gradually make it better. On the other hand, our students should also be aware of not being in a state of instability as in the past. We should cooperate to lead Great China University towards a new life."</p>
<p>After about thirty minutes, President Yang was still talking to us at length about school affairs when Dean Zhou of the College of Engineering of Great China University arrived. President Yang simply asked him to go upstairs and sit for a while, then sat down at the table and continued talking to us about many things at the school. However, we felt a little embarrassed, so Mr. Jiang repeated the request to resume enrollment in the Department of Agricultural Economics as a conclusion and hurriedly said goodbye and left.</p>
<p>Braving the rain and heading home, although it was still a misty autumn rain and wind and a little chilly, there was a pleasant and warm feeling in our hearts.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>On "Modern Chinese Western Painting"</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>"Modern," a fashionable title, attached to Chinese Western painting, is really a bit inappropriate, isn't it? Western painting in Europe since the 20th century has already had two important stages. The first stage was Cézanne of Post-Impressionism, and the second stage was Picasso. The reason they are called "modern" is that Cézanne was used as a watershed, overturning all the old art theories of the past and truly creating a brand-new "modern spirit." Chinese Western painting is not like that. Looking at its history, the introduction of Western painting at the earliest was no more than during the Yuan Dynasty when Catholicism was introduced to China. However, at that time, no one studied or promoted it, so strictly speaking, it should be traced back to the Republic of China. In these short thirty years or so, coupled with the impact of political changes and wars, the entire art movement was unable to unfold. The so-called "Western painting" relied on Western goods for its tools, so in this World War, those engaged in research had no way to obtain them. Therefore, in today's post-war era, only a few sparks of Western painting remain. Occasionally, one or two exhibitions are seen, and no one dares to acknowledge their works as "modern" Western paintings, I think.</p>
<p>Western painting in the West has a long and brilliant history, and it has undergone several changes to achieve today's achievements. When our country just began to study and promote it, the canvas in Europe had already been occupied by fierce and huge beast groups, and the Cubists, Futurists, and Dadaists who followed were putting on wonderful programs. However, our few founding pioneers were still faithfully copying the illustrations published in old foreign magazines, until a few students who had cut their queues and returned from studying abroad understood the A.B.C. of Western painting. Only then did they abolish copying and engage in sketching. Soon after, Impressionism was also sold back, and nude sketching appeared on the canvas. Is Impressionism suitable for Chinese tastes? Or do Chinese students only understand Impressionism? Why has the fate of Impressionism lasted until today, the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China? Although there was an organization called the "Storm Society" in Shanghai around the twentieth year of the Republic of China, and modern Western painting was promoted by their flag-waving, it ultimately did not arouse the attention of the general public and became a flash in the pan. Therefore, according to the state of affairs described above, we may as well divide "Chinese Western painting" into several periods. From the beginning of the Republic of China to the tenth year of the Republic of China, it was the cradle period. From the tenth to the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, it can be regarded as the pre-Impressionist period. From the fifteenth to the twentieth year, it was the heyday of Impressionism. From the twentieth to the twenty-sixth year, it was the budding period of "modern Chinese Western painting." From the twenty-sixth year to the present day, it can be called the restoration period of Impressionism. Therefore, in the strictest sense, it can be said that modern Chinese Western painting with a modern spirit has not yet been born and is awaiting the efforts of new writers.</p>
<h3>Nine Ruyi Picture</h3>
<p>Congratulations to Chairman on His Sixtieth Birthday</p>
<h3>A Verse in Celebration of Chairman's Sixtieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Jiang Suhui</p>
<p>Heaven gave birth to an extraordinary man for the country, proving it with ancient examples; it's not a mysterious saying. The Chinese territory was fragmented and lost for nine years, but now the rivers and mountains are restored to us, carried on both shoulders. Pacifying the masses and vowing to wipe out the shame, he defeated the proud enemy and recovered the Central Plains. All nations look up in awe, and great powers dare not tarnish his reputation. Looking back, there are still worries to be addressed; floods and fires bring great calamities. He does not speak of personal pain or pleasure, people should regret not ceasing war. It is better to reward merit and promote virtue; all peoples cry out with joy. The sacred mountain gives birth to a sage on his sixtieth birthday, comforting his lonely heart after sleepless nights. He embraces all things, with the vastness of the sea; he nurtures young talents like the spring breeze. His righteous principles are widespread, his wise strategies are comparable to those of ancient sages. Who in the world can wield a great pen to praise his achievements in restoring the nation? If the jade tablets with his writings are found, they will shine like the sun in the sky. Separated by mud and ditches, it is fitting that I, an old rustic, offer my humble blessings. May the leader be healthy, the people prosperous, and may he live tens of thousands of years, like the sage emperors Yao!</p>
<h3>Turgenev's Green Words</h3>
<p>I believe that for a thinking person, there is no desolate wilderness. At least I do my best not to let myself rust, grow moss, or become a straggler of the times.</p>
<p>I feel that if a person knows that he is poor and says it, his feelings must be special - there must be a kind of pride.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 78</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Seeing that this fellow's actions were not malicious, perhaps it was just a necessary procedure, I started the car and drove straight in. As I entered the passage, I suddenly had a realization and told myself, "This is the tiger's mouth!" Now that I've charged in, I don't know how I'll get out in the future. Thinking of this, my palms were a little clammy, and I felt a chill in my heart.</p>
<p>Just as I entered the passage, I suddenly heard someone shout loudly, "Slow down!" It was in Chinese. The shout echoed loudly in the tunnel, like thunder. As soon as I heard it, I slowed the car down. When I came out of the passage, I saw a soldier on the left waving his hand and saying in a rough voice, "Where are you going in such a hurry? Are your pants on fire?" He ordered us to turn left; in front of us was a steel mesh wall, and the parking lot was on the left, with walls and fences. I realized that the Japanese guard had told us to stop briefly so that this Northerner could open the fence to let us into the parking lot.</p>
<p>There were dozens of cars of various colors parked in the parking lot, arranged by category. As I parked, my younger brother and I paid close attention to our surroundings. Apart from the Northerner, there wasn't a single ghost in sight. The plaza was large and quiet. After seeing us enter the parking lot with the truck, the Northerner probably thought we were nothing more than low-ranking non-commissioned officers, so he didn't pay much attention to us. He immediately went to sit on a bamboo chair by the wall and began reading a tattered book.</p>
<p>"You've worked hard!" As we sized up our surroundings and walked up to the Northerner, he didn't bother to look up and simply grunted out the words. He probably said the same thing to every service member he encountered.</p>
<p>"You've worked hard too, everyone's working hard!" I lowered my voice. "Excuse me, is Chairman Chiang here? ... I came from the city to report an incident ...!" This was something I had prepared beforehand, and I only dared to ask because I saw that this fellow was easy to deal with. (In Tongzhou, those who work for the puppet government call Yin Ni "Chairman.")</p>
<p>"Alright, alright!" He really didn't want to put down that tattered book. "Go take a break, brothers. Do you think the Commander is up so early? ... He just went to bed!" He didn't take his eyes off the book, and he seemed annoyed that we were disturbing him.</p>
<p>"The Case of Peng Gong ... hee hee!" My younger brother winked at me. People from the north generally like to read stories like The Case of Shi Gong and The Case of Peng Gong, which emphasize chivalry.</p>
<p>"One doesn't grow wiser without experiencing something," I thought to myself. "This saying has now been proven in reality. When I listened to Sister Cui and her mother, I thought of this den of devils as a dragon's pool and tiger's lair, so I planned and prepared carefully before setting out. I was even prepared to risk my life, but who knew that the situation inside was so ordinary? It's clear that everyone needs some adventurous spirit in order not to be deceived by propaganda, to take charge of things practically, and to actually gain some experience." Thinking of this, I found our actions to be rather ridiculous.</p>
<p>As I was thinking this, I also heard my younger brother's hint, and I decided to start here and do some small trading. This fellow told us to go take a break, but we didn't know where to go to take a break. Therefore, we sat down next to him. Here, I took out my magic weapon.</p>
<p>"I rushed here in a hurry and forgot to bring cigarettes. Younger brother, do you have any?" As I spoke, I took out a roll of "military scrip" popular in the city and started counting it. I glanced sideways, and the fellow's eyes were gradually moving; from the book to the "scrip," from the "scrip" to my hand, slowly to my arm, and finally to my face. This was a soft tense situation, and it depended on his expression at this moment.</p>

<h3>Longevity</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Today is Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday. As long as they love the country and the nation, there is probably no Chinese person who is not happy and excited. Because our Chairman's relationship to the rise and fall of our country and nation is too great. In other words, the fate of the Chinese nation for the past thirty years has been tied to his person.</p>
<p>We sing praises, we pray, and apart from celebrating and commemorating with the way of offering to the school, every Chinese should also seriously examine their own life and behavior to see if they are worthy of the country and nation. If they are not worthy of the country and nation, then they are not worthy to wish the Chairman a long life.</p>
<p>Chairman has worked hard for the country for forty years, and the affairs of the country are still so chaotic. Today, we should especially feel ashamed!</p>
<h3>Life of the Leader</h3>
<p>— Jifeng</p>
<p>Northern Expedition * Marriage * Ordeal * War of Resistance</p>
<p>"The survival of the party and the country, the success or failure of the doctrine, the happiness or misfortune of the people, and the honor or disgrace of our comrades, depend on this battle!" On July 9, 1926, at the small school field in Guangzhou, Chairman Chiang read the oath of the Northern Expedition. Mr. Wu Zhihui presented the Chairman with a large birthday character for "Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army." From then on, Chairman Chiang inherited the unfinished legacy of the Founding Father and took on the heavy responsibility of revolution and nation-building - it has been twenty years now!</p>
<p>During the Northern Expedition, a foreign reporter went to visit Chairman Chiang and inquire about the accomplishments of his life. The Chairman only wrote down a few short words on paper: "Born in Zhejiang Province, studied at Baoding Military Academy and a school in Japan, followed Sun Yat-sen during the revolution."</p>
<p>On December 1, 1927, he married Ms. Soong Mei-ling in Shanghai. The wedding took place at the Great China Hotel, with Yu Rizhang as the officiant and Tan Yankai, He Xiangning, and Wang Zhengting as the introducers. At that time, the Chairman was forty years old and the Madame was twenty-five years old. The Chairman also wrote an article titled "Our Today" and published it in the Shen Bao that day, in which he said:</p>
<p>"Today I am marrying Ms. Soong Mei-ling, whom I most respect and love, is the most glorious day of my life, and also the happiest day of my life. ... I firmly believe that after my marriage to Ms. Soong, my revolutionary work will definitely improve. I can be at ease in fulfilling my revolutionary responsibilities, starting from today!"</p>
<p>The National Revolutionary Army entered Beiping, and the Chairman wrote in the "Memorial to the Premier": "I have long been determined to devote myself to the Party and the country until death. I never expected that after surviving hundreds of battles, I would still be able to pay my respects at the Premier's memorial hall. From now on, the rest of my life will be a year of struggle. I will exert all my strength and be loyal. Success or failure is not what I care about!"</p>
<p>On the Lantern Festival of the twenty-third year, the Chairman convened the "New Life Movement Conference" in Nanchang, with 150,000 people attending, accounting for three-quarters of the population of Nanchang. As the Chairman was speaking, a photographer who was listless and wearing dirty clothes wanted to take some photos. The Chairman immediately pointed to the photographer and said to the audience: "This person's appearance and attitude are a complete old life and do not meet the conditions of the new life at all. I hope everyone will pay attention in the future and not be like him!" The photographer was so ashamed that he ran away.</p>
<p>After the Chairman escaped danger in Xi'an, a villager named Liu sent the 4,200 coins he had saved to the Chairman through a newspaper office in Nanjing, and attached a letter saying: "Please, Chairman, buy some longans to eat."</p>
<p>"Since we are a weak country, if we reach the final moment and have to sacrifice the lives of the entire nation in order to seek the survival of the country, then we will not be allowed to compromise halfway!</p>
<p>When the final moment arrives, we can only sacrifice to the end and resist to the end; only with the determination to sacrifice to the end can we win the final victory!" This was a historically significant speech given by the Chairman at Mount Lu after the July 7th Incident. Sure enough, after eight years of hard fighting, the final victory was won! Today, as the whole country congratulates the Chairman on his sixtieth birthday, we respectfully wish the Chairman good health!</p>
<h3>The Statue of Liberty</h3>
<p>— Lan Ning</p>
<p>Celebrating its 60th Anniversary in New York</p>
<p>On Bedloe's Island in New York Harbor, USA, stands a strikingly tall statue of a goddess, draped in a classical Greek robe. She holds a book in her left hand and raises a torch in her right, welcoming incoming ships and emitting guiding light in the darkness.</p>
<p>This is the world-renowned Statue of Liberty, not only the largest copper statue in the world but also a symbol of "freedom" in the world today. The day before yesterday (the 28th) was its 60th anniversary.</p>
<p>However, when the French first initiated the idea of building the statue and gifting it to the New World in Paris, they faced various difficulties and spent several years on the project. Funds were raised household by household. In 1865, a number of artists and politicians gathered near Versailles, recognizing that the peoples of France and America had shed blood for a common goal, they wanted to take advantage of the centennial of the American Revolution to build a memorial statue, commemorating the truth of their shared struggle. Therefore, the famous sculptor Bartholdi was sent to the United States to seek inspiration for the design.</p>
<p>As soon as he entered New York Harbor, the impression of "freedom" arose in his mind. This was a vast city, with rivers extending into the distance, beyond sight. The broad harbor was an inner sea crowded with ships. This was where the giant statue should stand. So Bartholdi returned to France with a plan: the French would create the statue, and the Americans would build the pedestal.</p>
<p>The Franco-Prussian War hindered the progress of the plan, but even after France's defeat, donations poured in, aiming for $450,000. Formal work only began in 1881.</p>
<p>Bartholdi decided to cast the statue of the goddess using copper sheets, dividing it into several sections for easy transportation. These copper pieces were assembled on an iron framework, hollow inside, with staircases accessible throughout.</p>
<p>But strangely, the American side was slow to proceed. Raising the $350,000 needed to build the statue's base proved difficult, collected bit by bit. By June 1885, when the completed Statue of Liberty arrived in New York Harbor aboard the French warship Isère, the funds for the granite pedestal were still $100,000 short, and it was already the seventh year of fundraising. As a result, Bartholdi's masterpiece could only be temporarily stored in the basement of an empty warehouse. If not for the support of Joseph Pulitzer, publisher of the New York World, it might have remained hidden indefinitely.</p>
<p>Pulitzer vigorously promoted the statue in his news reports and editorials, portraying it as a symbol of freedom. Within five months, the newspaper received contributions from 120,000 people across the United States, in amounts ranging from pennies to dollars.</p>
<p>The magnificent and solemn Statue of Liberty, 151 feet tall and weighing 225 tons, was finally unveiled on October 28, 1886. Participants in the ceremony paraded from Broadway towards the harbor. A fleet of ships carried representatives from various countries to observe the event. President Cleveland also attended aboard the warship Dispatch. Brilliant fireworks were displayed at night.</p>
<p>Now, the Statue of Liberty bears a new American imprint. Carved into its cornerstone is a sonnet by Emma Lazarus, "The New Colossus," which, through the voice of the goddess, extends a welcoming invitation to the exiles of the Old World:</p>
<p>Give me your tired, your poor,</p>
<p>Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,</p>
<p>The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.</p>
<p>Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,</p>
<p>I lift my lamp beside the golden door!</p>
<p>Initially, the torch in the Statue of Liberty's hand did not have light. Years later, the copper was replaced with glass, and lights were placed inside. In 1916, the New York World raised money to replace it with permanent, powerful lights. Mr. Bourlier then refitted the glass lampshade with red amber. After the victory in the European war, the torch was equipped with the brightest mercury lamps, bathing the Statue of Liberty in bright and dazzling colors.</p>
<p>Every year, 800,000 travelers come to admire it and climb inside. The crown on her head is decorated with a circle of small windows, from which visitors can enjoy a panoramic view.</p>
<p>Bartholdi's masterpiece, the result of ten years of painstaking effort, has achieved invaluable success. Today, millions of people who love freedom have come to see it as a symbol of freedom.</p>
<h3>Remembering Mr. Huang Xing</h3>
<p>— Hui Ye</p>
<p>"Ten thousand brave soldiers gallop across the land, how can they bear to stand their horses in Youyan? Where do the barbarian slaves linger? In the setting sun, the felt tents are lost, and the beacon fires extinguish the remaining smoke. Recover the golden goblet and return it to the Han descendants, to see again the days of Shun and Yao! The five-colored national flag is most solemn, fluttering with the bright moon, soaring into the white clouds."</p>
<p>This慷慨激昂"Linjiang Xian"臨江仙慷慨激昂, full of righteous indignation, comes from the pen of the revolutionary martyr Mr. Huang Xing. The writing reflects the man, capturing the general's loyalty and uninhibited spirit, vividly on paper.</p>
<p>Those who have read history can eloquently praise his life's deeds. But, do you remember? Today marks the 30th anniversary of Mr. Huang Xing's death!</p>
<p>Thirty years ago today, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, and the revolution had achieved initial success. People were eager to promote a republic and believed that they could finally live and work in peace. But who knew that warlords would rise, vying for territory and power, creating internal strife and years of war? The people were destitute, and the country remained on the brink of division! Mr. Huang Xing, seeing that the revolutionary achievements gained by his comrades' heads and blood were disintegrating, how could he not feel grief and indignation? On October 31st, 1916, in Shanghai, while discussing the current situation with friends, he became increasingly agitated and angry, eventually coughing up blood. That is how Mr. Huang Xing died.</p>
<p>What about today, thirty years later? Japan has been defeated, and the country has achieved victory, eager to promote constitutional government. People were eager to promote a republic and believed that they could finally live and work in peace. But who knew it would turn out this way? The people are destitute, and the country is on the brink of division! The victory achieved by the soldiers' heads and blood is disintegrating. If Mr. Huang Xing were still alive today, he would surely die of anger too!</p>
<p>How can the Chinese people face their martyrs?</p>

<h3>Congratulations to President Chiang on His Sixtieth Birthday</h3>

<p>This article was written at the request of the Nanjing Special City Party Department to pay tribute on behalf of the party members. Therefore, the author noted that "Director-General" is used wherever President Chiang's name appears in the article.</p>
<p>Majestic mountains and beautiful waters, spiritual clock Wuling Township; auspicious bow hangs, light is covered with the appearance of Yinghuan. October 31, 1946, is actually the 60th birthday of Chiang Kai-shek, Director-General of the Chinese Kuomintang. Xiang Zheng'er is smooth, and the sound of joy moves the heart.

Therefore, we meet with comrades and collect signatures. Use to show respect and wish difficult old age. It is polite too.</p>
<p>The Director-General is born holy, and his consciousness comes before others. At the age of弱冠weak crown, he learned from the enemy of thousands of people.

<h3>Chairman's Personally Drafted and Explained Youth Code</h3>
<p>First, "Loyalty and Courage are the Foundation of Patriotism." To love our country and save our country, we must first cultivate a spirit and virtue of loyalty and courage. At the same time, our loyalty and courage must be used to love our country, to save our country, and must be for the public good and not for private gain, for others and not for ourselves. Therefore, the true meaning of loyalty and courage is what the ancients called "serving the country with utmost loyalty," "sacrificing oneself for righteousness," "being selfless in public affairs and forgetting one's family for the sake of the country," and "being brave in public battles and timid in private quarrels."</p>
<p>Second, "Filial Piety and Obedience are the Foundation of Managing the Family." To make our family harmonious, with order and reason from top to bottom, and united as one, creating a peaceful and happy family, we must start with filial piety to our parents. Because we must fulfill our filial duties, then there will be distinction between elders and juniors, and order between young and old. Only then can family matters be handled properly and reasonably, and can be carried forward and promoted.</p>
<p>Third, "Benevolence and Love are the Foundation of Dealing with Others." "Dealing with others" includes both interpersonal relations and handling matters. Our standard for dealing with others is "benevolence and love," which is what the ancients called "benevolent to the people and loving to all things." We must love our compatriots, love our friends, and even love all of humanity and all things in the universe, as it is said, "The people are my compatriots, and all things are my companions," "Heaven and earth are born together with me, and all things are one with me." This is the spirit of benevolence and love. If we treat people, handle affairs, and use things with this great spirit, we will surely be loved and helped by others everywhere, and make the best use of things. In this way, even if we make only a small effort, we can achieve at least ten times the result. All the forces that love us can be transformed into our strength, and can even multiply our strength countless times.</p>
<p>Fourth, "Trustworthiness and Righteousness are the Foundation of Establishing a Career." If we want to achieve something, we must gain the trust and help of others. To gain the trust and help of others, we must first have trustworthiness and righteousness ourselves. In dealing with people, we must first demonstrate our faith and morality in our actions, so that people believe in us. This cannot be achieved by those who are unfaithful, unrighteous, selfish, and cowardly. We must first have loyalty and faith, and then others will believe in us, and we can succeed in our careers.</p>
<p>Fifth, "Peace is the Foundation of Conducting Oneself in the World." "Peace" refers to the relationship between people; "harmony" means loving each other and not having jealousy, suspicion, scolding, fighting, or even killing each other. "Equality" means being fair to each other and not having encroachment, contention, bullying, partiality, or harming others for one's own benefit. We must be fair in order to be loving; we must have peace in order to conduct ourselves in the world. Individuals in society should treat others with peace. All our compatriots should love each other. We should rather suffer losses ourselves than take advantage of others. We must understand that those who uphold justice and maintain peace will surely achieve ultimate success. Those who suffer small losses now will eventually gain advantages; those who take small advantages now will eventually suffer great losses. All our compatriots must understand this principle and live together in peace. Our first step is to realize lasting peace throughout the entire country and create the most peaceful country. The second step is to contribute our Chinese peace to the world and realize universal peace throughout the world. Peace is an inherent virtue of our China, and we always advocate peace. However, in order to maintain the survival of our country and the survival of our nation, we must of course have the ability and determination to defend ourselves. If foreigners want to invade us and oppress us, it is they who are destroying peace and disrupting peace. We must resist and fight for the sake of upholding justice and strive for lasting peace. Therefore, when all peaceful means have been exhausted and peace is hopeless, we can only and must seek ways to achieve independence, self-preservation, and consolidate peace in addition to peaceful means.</p>
<p>Sixth, "Etiquette is the Foundation of Managing Affairs." This means that we must pay attention to etiquette in order to handle things well. Because without etiquette, there will be no order in society and human affairs, nor can there be stability. Human relations will be even more chaotic, and nothing can be done. The ancients said, "Etiquette is reason!" This means that we must be organized, disciplined, and have a normal and reasonable attitude and rules in our conduct and work. We must pay attention to etiquette at all times and in all places in order to be a person and do things. Otherwise, we cannot be a person, let alone handle affairs. Therefore, it is said, "Without knowledge of etiquette, there is no way to stand." "Etiquette is the management of affairs. A gentleman who has a task must have its management; without etiquette, hands and feet will have nowhere to place, eyes and ears will have nothing to add, advances and retreats, bows and concessions will have no control, hunting and military affairs will lose their strategies, and military expeditions and martial arts will lose their systems."</p>
<p>Seventh, "Obedience is the Foundation of Responsibility." If we want to make our country strong, all citizens must be able to take responsibility and work together. How can we take on this responsibility and how can everyone's work be more effective? The most important thing is that in terms of horizontal relationships, we must divide labor and cooperate with each other; in terms of vertical relationships, we must have hierarchical control. The reason why everything in our country cannot be done well and the country has been brought to such a critical state of survival is because people only know how to fight for power and profit, and are unwilling to take responsibility and do their duty. Everyone wants to talk about freedom and equality, and as a result, the country and nation will perish. They do not understand that modern citizens should sacrifice their own freedom and equality in order to seek the freedom and equality of the entire country. In the future, if we want to save the country, everyone must take responsibility, and the fundamental premise of responsibility is that everyone must sacrifice their personal freedom and equality, obey the government, obey the law, and obey their superiors in order to fulfill their duties. The government is the organ of the country, the law is the will of the country, and the superior is the representative of the government. Therefore, our obedience to our superiors is not obedience to an individual, but obedience to the orders they issue in accordance with the laws of the country. In short, our obedience is obedience to the country, obedience to our duties, which is obedience to our own responsibility. Because the country is my own and the duty is also my own, such obedience is also obedience to myself. If I can obey myself, this is called "self-discipline." All those who can practice self-discipline will succeed. Therefore, we obey for the sake of the country, not for the sake of any individual, let alone for the sake of private individuals. Therefore, this kind of obedience is glorious, not shameful. Only in this way can we truly obey, truly take responsibility, and be worthy of being a modern citizen!</p>
<p>Eighth, "Diligence and Frugality are the Foundation of Service." We ourselves are part of society and the country, so serving society and the country is serving ourselves. I am for everyone, and everyone is for me. This is the first principle of self-help and sociability. Only in this way can life have meaning and value. Where should we start serving society and the country? It is to be diligent and frugal. We must be diligent in order to make contributions; we must be frugal in order to have self-control and avoid consumption. In the first aspect, our goal of diligence and frugality must be to serve the people. Therefore, if frugality is for private gain and not for the public good, like those people who "rise at cockcrow and work diligently for profit," this kind of diligence and frugality is of no benefit to the country or the people, and is not true frugality. We must understand that living in modern times, without the entire society, the entire nation, and the entire country, there will be no one person who can be warm when everyone else is hungry and cold, and no one person who can be at peace when everyone else is in distress. Therefore, we must establish the ambition of "worrying before others and enjoying after others" and develop the spirit of labor and service. To establish others is to establish ourselves, and to save others is to save ourselves.</p>
<p>Ninth, "Cleanliness is the Foundation of Cultivating Oneself." "Cultivating oneself" refers to the cultivation of both the inner mind and the body. To cultivate ourselves, we must start with cleanliness. We must be dedicated, pure, and unified inwardly, with a clear mind; outwardly, we must be orderly, solemn, clean, and bright. Extending this to the things around us and the environment in which we live, we must make them so, and then we can be strong and healthy, have noble character, and have clear minds. Most people do not know the importance of cleanliness. Even like the famous scholars of the past, they claimed to be unrestrained and called it elegance to be unclean. We should eradicate and wash away this bad habit and shame. However, what I mean by cleanliness is to be simple and unadorned, which is absolutely different from luxury and beauty.</p>
<p>Tenth, "Helping Others is the Foundation of Happiness." As human beings, we all want to be happy, but if we seek happiness in the wrong way, we will seek pain and create evil. For example, most people now think that leisure and play, gambling, and idleness are happiness. They do not know that these things are not only not happiness, but also waste our energy, destroy our lives, and increase our sins and sufferings. They do not know that the greatest happiness in the human heart is helping others. The ancients said, "The more one does for others, the more one has; the more one gives to others, the more one has." It is also said, "Doing good is the greatest joy." This means that the more we can help others, the more benefits we will have, and the happier we will be. The Boy Scouts have a motto, "Do a good deed every day," which is to help others. For example, rescuing the drowning, fighting fires, helping the elderly, protecting the young, and helping the poor, hungry, sick, and distressed are all good deeds, no matter how small. Doing good can bring true happiness. All compatriots of the Republic of China should seek happiness in this way, love each other, and help each other. As long as we have a little strength, we must do our best to help our compatriots. This is the greatest happiness.</p>
<p>Eleventh, "Knowledge is the Foundation of Benefiting the World." This sentence means, on the one hand, that we must have knowledge and ability in order to benefit the world and save the people. This is what President Sun Yat-sen meant when he said, "The foundation of revolution lies in profound knowledge." On the other hand, it means that the purpose of our studying all knowledge and skills is to benefit the world and save people, not to be aimless and meaningless, not to seek personal comfort and security, and even less to use knowledge and technology to harm others for our own benefit, or to commit evil deeds.</p>
<p>Twelfth, "Perseverance is the Foundation of Success." We all hope that we can succeed in establishing a career. What is the most important condition for success? It is perseverance. Whatever we do, we must continue to work hard and not give up halfway or be fickle. We must have a beginning and an end, and carry through to the end. Especially if we want to succeed in a lifelong endeavor, we must choose a bright and righteous path, work hard to move forward, and never change until death, so as to achieve the last two sentences of President Sun Yat-sen's last will: "With one heart and one mind, carry through to the end."</p>
<h3>Longevity Commemorative Album Now Presented to the Capital by Special Envoy</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Today is Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday, and the whole country celebrates and the world rejoices. Although all sectors of Shanghai are enthusiastically holding various celebration programs, they are not enough to repay our hard-working and meritorious Chairman, but only express the respect of the four million citizens for the Chairman.</p>
<p>The Chairman advocates frugality and has repeatedly instructed all parties not to be extravagant. Therefore, all sectors of this city have launched various constructive undertakings, the meaning of which is profound. In addition to donating schools to celebrate his birthday and establishing various scholarships, Shanghai has also prepared a commemorative album to present to the Chairman.</p>
<p>This album is 12.5 inches long, 10 inches wide, and 4 inches thick. It was organized by the design group of the Preparatory Committee, and Dr. Pang Jingzhou made his best efforts. The cover and back cover of the commemorative album are mounted with brocade silk. The cover is inscribed by Wu Jingheng, a veteran of the Kuomintang, "Shanghai Citizens' Congratulatory Commemorative Album for Chairman Chiang's Sixtieth Birthday." The inside is all mounted with white silk paper, with a total of 102 pages. The front is entirely pasted with yellow paper, with each page divided into eight squares, on which are written the names of 802 units of groups and institutions in the city, with the City Council listed first. The back is entirely mounted with 70 Chinese paintings, each two feet wide, all masterpieces by famous Shanghai painters. The order is not specified, only the landscapes are slightly separated, but the first painting is by the famous painter Yao Yuqin, because he is 80 years old this year, the oldest of the painters. This is a painting of orchids, titled "The Fragrance of the King."</p>
<p>In recent days, people have been signing their names at the Ningbo Native Place Association. Many citizens have requested to sign their names, but because it is stipulated that each institution is represented by its responsible person, they have all retreated in disappointment. This commemorative album is scheduled to be presented to the Chairman in the capital today by a special envoy.</p>

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek's Educational Thought</h3>
<p>— Compiled by this newspaper's data room</p>
<p>Educational Theory</p>
<p>Those who run education, if they see that education is not effective, there is no second word, that is, will is the most important. If we want to achieve the purpose of learning, there is no other way, that is, to see if the will can be consistent. — April 7, year 14, instruction to students of the third class of the military academy.</p>
<p>Morality, Physique and Science In the future, educational facilities must follow the regulations of the educational purpose of the Republic of China and its implementation policy, and pay special attention to the cultivation of inherent morality, the training of strong physique, and the infusion of modern science. — May 17, year 20, speech at the closing ceremony of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Being a Person Originally, the highest purpose of education is to enable the educated to be good citizens and good people. If a student does not know how to love the country and does not know the principles of being a person, the effect of education is equal to zero. Therefore, the first key point of our saving the country now is to pay attention to education, and even more to training, to pay attention to making students know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. This is an important point in revitalizing the nation and saving the country. — October 31, year 21, speech at the enlarged memorial week in Changsha Zhongshan Memorial Hall.</p>
<p>Teaching and Nurturing The education in our schools now cannot only be teaching, but also nurturing. We must combine teaching and nurturing. What is called education now is teaching without nurturing, which is not complete education. I think the components of education are one-third teaching and two-thirds nurturing. — Ibid.</p>
<p>These two words "education," most people only know that it is one thing, and the result is either "teaching without nurturing" or "nurturing without teaching." They do not know that these two words "teaching" and "nurturing" are completely two things, and we must pay attention to both of them and do both well in order to be considered "education." What does it mean to be "teaching"? Teaching is to teach our subordinates or students to know the principles of being a person and the methods of succeeding in a career, so that they can succeed as a person. What are the principles of being a person? How can we teach them to succeed as a person? The most important thing in the spirit of being a person is what I said, "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame." "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" is a spirit that we teach. We must make the educated understand etiquette, respect morality, pay attention to integrity, and know shame in order to know the principles of being a person and to truly be a person. As for what is called "nurturing"? Nurturing is to raise, and the meaning of raising is to protect and nurture. Specifically, it is to give them the necessities of life and to teach them the basic ways of life, that is, the four major things of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. — September 10, year 22, speech at the Lushan Military Officers' Corps.</p>
<p>Just "nurturing" is not enough, we must have "teaching," and "teaching" must come before "nurturing." The subjects of teaching are propriety, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic; the basic elements of teaching are propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. — September 20, year 22, speech to the training class for cooperative personnel in Xingzi County.</p>
<p>Understanding the Times and Understanding Our Country The transmission of knowledge and skills is only a part of the function of education. We must instill in them the spirit of loving the country, loving the nation, and loving our compatriots, charge them with the responsibility of bearing the rise and fall of the nation and completing the national revolution, and teach them to understand the times, understand our country, face the world squarely, and have a long-term vision for the future. — February 20, year 29, telegram encouraging teachers at all levels at the beginning of the semester after the winter vacation.</p>
<p>Three Elements of the Country Education, economy, and military force are the three elements that constitute the vitality of a modern country, and education is the key to them. — October 31, year 29, inaugural anniversary instruction of Chung Cheng University.</p>
<p>Being Loyal to the Country The first step in the purpose of our teaching is naturally to teach them to be a true person in the world. The second step is to become a good citizen of the Republic of China, able to love the country and be loyal to the country. Specifically, it is to make every student have a deep sense of national concept and a deep sense of national consciousness; they will never learn to be foreigners, nor will they ever be foreign slaves or traitors, but will be able to actively sacrifice themselves to love the country and protect the nation. — May 19, year 24, instruction to faculty and students of schools above the secondary level in Kunming.</p>
<p>Benefiting the World The purpose and effect of our learning can be said to be the four words "benefiting the world and pacifying the people," which is what the ancients called "benefiting the world." — Ibid.</p>
<p>Educational Policy</p>
<p>Construction Now the National Revolution has not yet been completely successful, but the period of destruction has passed. If we use destructive means again, like the previous revolution, the result will be failure. Therefore, the first thing we must pay attention to when running education now is construction.</p>
<p>Strictness The only way to save China now is through education, and the only policy of education is the word "strictness." — April 16, year 20, speech at Zhejiang University.</p>
<p>New Academic Style The future of the country will all start from education. The first step is to completely change the academic style and succeed in creating a truly revolutionary new academic style, an academic style that saves the country. — October 10, year 21, instruction to faculty and staff of Wuhan University.</p>
<p>Inherent Culture If we want to build a country, we must first build our own culture; if we want to build China's own culture, we do not need to build it all at once in China. As long as we can truly restore our inherent national culture and use it with the spirit of the new era, it will be enough. — September 20, year 22, speech to the training class for cooperative personnel in Xingzi County.</p>
<p>Education of Action In the future, education in our country must correct all the past accumulated habits of emptiness, impracticality, decadence, and looseness, and create a lively, progressive, strong, united, and action-oriented atmosphere. Only in this way can it be considered education of action, can it enrich the vitality of the country, and achieve the purpose of saving the country through education. — May 19, year 24, instruction to faculty and students of schools above the secondary level in Kunming.</p>
<p>Making the Best Use of People The way to establish a country is nothing more than the four major principles shown by President Sun Yat-sen: "Making the best use of people's talents, making the best use of the land's benefits, making the best use of things, and making the flow of goods smooth." In terms of its fundamentals, it lies in "making the best use of people's talents." If we want to "make the best use of people's talents," the fundamental thing is the perfection of education. — June 9, year 24, instruction to the educational circles summoned in the Chengdu Xingyuan.</p>
<p>Cultivating All Six Arts Ancient education in our country was originally a combination of literature and military affairs, and a combination of skills and virtue. Now, in general, it is believed that literary schools only talk about literature and art, and do not talk about martial arts. This is completely wrong. In the future, school education should still be based on the ancient spirit of combining literature and military affairs and the principle of cultivating all six arts. However, the content of education should be more enriched. — June 17, year 24, purchase during the third enlarged memorial week in Chengdu.</p>
<p>Qualitative Improvement In the future, if we want to develop education, on the one hand, we must try to popularize it in order to increase the quantity; but on the other hand, we must especially strive for qualitative improvement in order to progress. In terms of our current strength and factual needs, we should first seek qualitative improvement in education, and the expansion of quantity is secondary. — May 10, year 25, opening instruction of the Executive Yuan meeting.</p>
<p>Teacher Issues</p>
<p>Do it Yourself First You must first do what you teach others yourself. If you do not care whether you can do it yourself, but only ask others to do it, this is deceiving yourself. — Speech at the Huangpu Military Academy in year 13.</p>
<p>Revolutionize Yourself Those who engage in education must revolutionize themselves every day in order to make the students good. And it is easy to make the students risk fire, and they will risk fire; order them to go to the water, and they will go to the water; only then can good results be obtained. — Speech in Huangpu on May 3, year 15.</p>
<p>Do Not Use Students We must rectify education and save the academic style in the future. The most important thing is that faculty and staff must be clean and self-loving. They must teach students to be people, and not use students as tools. — Speech at the enlarged memorial week in Changsha Zhongshan Memorial Hall on November 7, year 21.</p>
<p>Practical Life The education in our country in recent decades has focused on the transmission of knowledge and skills, but has paid little attention to the rectification of the lives of the educators themselves and the guidance of the actual lives of the educated. The things taught and learned are almost unrelated to practical life, or are completely out of touch. — Speech at the reception of the participants of the Third National Education Conference on March 5, year 28.</p>
<p>Guiding Ideology Teachers should resolutely shoulder the responsibility of guiding students' thoughts, cultivating students' character, managing students' lives, exercising students' physical strength, and perfecting students' personality. — Telegram encouraging teachers at all levels on February 20, year 29.</p>
<p>The Responsibility of the Educational Circles If we in the educational circles have the courage, the spirit, the responsibility, and the duty to reform the declining atmosphere and change the temperament, so that the general social youth can follow the trend and be influenced by us, and work together for the country and the nation, then our Three People's Principles can be fully realized and the cause of nation-building can be greatly successful. — Instruction to the national cadre work conference of the Three People's Principles Youth League on July 2, year 30.</p>
<p>Sacred Cause The education cause is a sacred cause, that is, the cause of sages and virtuous men. Only sages and virtuous men can influence others, so that the generally educated can follow the right path and develop completely, so as to reach the ultimate of the sage's and virtuous men's achievements. Ibid.</p>

<p>Training Issues</p>
<p>The greatest point of personally studying the purpose of education is to hope that the educators themselves will study and manage themselves in order to make progress, and not to rely on the educators to supervise. Otherwise, the result of education will definitely not be good. If the educated do not understand this point, do not study themselves, and do not seek progress, and must be supervised and managed by the educators, then they cannot be independent, cannot be strong, and cannot be autonomous. — Speech in Huangpu on January 13, year 15.</p>
<p>To Influence with Personality To teach people, we must first teach them the principles of being a person, which can also be said to enable them to determine their outlook on life. Only in this way can it be considered education, only in this way can we train healthy young citizens, only in this way can we prevent students from being romantic and indulgent, and from doing things beyond the scope of students. To achieve such effectiveness, we as teachers must be with them from morning to evening, and pay attention to the work of training in an invisible and silent way. Therefore, we teachers must use our own personality to influence students, and we must first use our personality to train students in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort and achieve the effectiveness of saving the country. — Speech to the educational circles in Wuhan at Yihe Village from July 18 to 20, year 21.</p>
<p>Enlightenment and Guidance The most important point is that we must enable every student to know the principles of being a person and the responsibilities of students, and develop their spirit of serving the society and the country and the habit of labor in training and practice. The minds of young people are all flawless white jade, and they are also lively and active. If the educators can follow their pure and good nature and do their best to enlighten and guide them, there is no one who cannot become a healthy and good citizen and serve the society and labor in order to fulfill their duties as citizens. — June 9, year 24, instruction to the educational circles summoned in the Chengdu Xingyuan.</p>
<p>The most urgent and effective thing at present is to engage in the transformation of society and people's hearts through the method of gradual transformation. — July 2, year 24, speech to the gentry in Chengdu.</p>

<h3>The Scenic Beauty of Xikou Described</h3>
<p>— From Our Newspaper's Reference Room</p>
<p>Xikou, the birthplace of Chairman Chiang, is a place of scenic beauty. It has the unique charm of a Jiangnan water town, but is also surrounded by mountains, with peaks rising and falling. In the freshness of the South, it also carries a sense of the North's solemnity and grandeur. Naturally, the environment often has a great influence on people. The clear blue sky on the Aegean Sea gave the Greeks a bright philosophical wisdom, while the thick fogs on the British Isles endowed the British with a deep and persevering character. Xikou, with its beautiful scenery, simple folk customs, the gurgling streams beside Qianzhang Rock, and the white snow on the mountain peaks, has naturally nurtured Chairman Chiang from a young age into a character of brightness, wisdom, benevolence, and perseverance.</p>
<p>A Sightseeing Journey</p>
<p>People who go to visit and admire the birthplace of this great man mostly go to Ningbo first, and then take a long-distance bus on the Yin-Feng Highway to Fenghua. The bus speeds forward on a road paved with sand and gravel. After a journey of more than an hour, after passing Jiangkou Bridge, the county seat of Fenghua comes into view. Fenghua is a city with an area of more than 5,000 square li, and currently has a population of two to three hundred thousand people. There are two middle schools here: Fenghua County Middle School and Taiqing Middle School. Fenghua Middle School was founded during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, originally named Fenglu Academy, and was where Chairman Chiang studied in his youth.</p>
<p>From Fenghua City to Xikou Station in the county, the first thing that catches the eye is the solemn and majestic Wuling Gate. Many large trees are planted on both sides of the gate. On hot summer days, in the depths of the shade, the sound of cicadas harmonizes, and travelers feel an unspeakable sense of coolness and tranquility in their hearts. On Wuling Gate are the two large characters "Wuling," personally inscribed by Chairman Chiang. Inside the gate are many modern and magnificent buildings, which are Wuling School and Wuling Hospital.</p>
<p>A Closer View of Jinxi</p>
<p>Wuling School has junior high and elementary schools, and this year a high school has also been added. Currently, there are more than 700 students. Students do not need to pay any fees for their studies. The school also has a hospital, a farm, a forest garden, and even a small-scale cannery. While studying, the students also participate in production work during their spare time. The principal of Wuling School is personally held by Chairman Chiang, and the school affairs are managed by Dean Shi Jiyan. When the school was first recovered after the victory, the school buildings had been messed up and destroyed, but now they have been completely renovated. The newly built school buildings are a combination of Chinese and Western styles, with palace-style roofs and Western-style bodies. Trees are planted all around, creating a quiet and secluded environment.</p>
<p>Near Wuling School, facing Jinxi, there is a pavilion for tourists to rest, called the Octagonal Pavilion. The Octagonal Pavilion is located on a rock, surrounded by flowers and trees. Standing in front of the pavilion, leaning on the railing and looking down, the beautiful scenery of Xikou can be seen. Looking north, there is a long Xikou Main Street. One side of the street is along the stream, and the other side is full of shops, interspersed with some green trees. The shops on Xikou Street are very small, because most of the residents there live by farming. The telecommunications bureau is also there. There is also a police station in the town, but the total number of police chief and police officers is only twelve. The simplicity of Xikou's folk customs makes the police dispensable.</p>
<p>Passing on Loyalty and Filial Piety</p>
<p>In Xikou Town, the Jiang Family Ancestral Hall has the four characters "Passing on Loyalty and Filial Piety" personally inscribed by Chairman Chiang in front of the door. Chairman Chiang's former residence, No. 51 Xikou Town, is a simple old-fashioned house. Walking through the cave gate with white powder walls, inside are several southern-style houses; the middle is the main hall, where the gods are enshrined, and the portrait of Chairman Chiang's mother, Madame Wang, is also hung there, with several marble-inlaid chairs and coffee tables placed on both sides. Folding inside, there is also a row of quiet and simple houses, which is where the great man was born.</p>
<p>Proceeding from here, to the foot of Yulin Mountain, climbing up the steps, you can soon see the tomb of Chiang's mother. On both sides of the stone steps on the hillside, pines and cypresses are lush, shadows cover the ground, and from time to time there comes a burst of faint floral fragrance, coupled with the light singing of birds in the forest. Madame Wang, who taught her son with loyalty and filial piety, is resting here. There is a plaque over the entrance to the tomb, with the two characters "Ci An" [Kind Hermitage] written by Tan Yankai. Behind is a pavilion with a stele, on which is engraved the National Father's [Sun Yat-sen's] eulogy to Chiang's mother. On both sides of the stele pavilion, to the right is Chairman Chiang's bedroom. When Chairman Chiang comes, he often stays here. To the left is the reception room, with some ordinary sofas and tables and chairs. Following the mountain path further up, you will reach the front of Chiang's mother's tomb. There is a stone stele in front of the tomb, with the four large characters "Tomb of Chiang's Mother" handwritten by the National Father.</p>
<p>The Wonders of Miaogao and Xuedou</p>
<p>The most famous scenery of Xikou is Miaogao Terrace and Xuedou Temple. Miaogao is on Siming Mountain. Looking around, there are layers of high mountains, with clouds slowly floating above them. People who come here feel their minds broaden. About three li opposite Miaogao is Xuedou Temple. The Qianzhang Rock Waterfall nearby is a famous scenic spot. Qianzhang Rock faces a cliff and deep abyss. The waterfall rushes down from the rock like a white silk, winding and circling to Shangyin Pool. The surrounding walls are cut off, and only one road can pass through. The mountains are full of lush bamboo forests and have a reputation as a good place to escape the summer heat.</p>
<p>There are many bamboo forests in Xikou. Many families have bamboo gardens and use them as a sideline. Bamboo shoots are available almost all year round. In spring there are bamboo shoots, after the bamboo shoots there are hairy shoots and big shoots, in summer there are whip shoots, and in winter there are winter shoots. In addition to being transported fresh to other places, bamboo shoots are often boiled in salt water, dried in the sun, and made into dried bamboo shoots. Ningbo dried bamboo shoots are a specialty and also a favorite dish of Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>Xikou has not become rich and prosperous because it is the birthplace of Chairman Chiang, but because it produced such a great man, the people of all China today remember its name with gratitude and respect.</p>
<h3>School Presentation and Longevity Wishes: Shanghai Workers Donate Half a Day's Wages</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Representatives of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and its affiliated trade unions went to the Ningbo Fellow Association yesterday morning to sign the longevity commemorative book and decided to participate in the longevity celebration on the 31st afternoon. They have also decided that workers throughout the city will donate half a day's wages as a school presentation fund. It is said that the Federation of Trade Unions will request that one or two of the presented schools be selected and named Labor Schools.</p>
<h3>The Best Gift: The School Presentation Movement is Spreading Throughout the Country</h3>
<p>— From Our Newspaper's Reference Room</p>
<p>This year, on October 31st, we happily celebrate Chairman Chiang's 60th birthday. The Shanghai Municipal Council passed the "Launch a Celebration of the Head of State's 60th Birthday, Establish a Permanent Memorial, to Show Respect for Virtue and Gratitude for Meritorious Service" proposal on September 21st and stipulated four measures: (1) The Council will send a letter to all mass organizations in the city to organize a Preparatory Committee for the Celebration of the Head of State's 60th Birthday. (2) The Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Council will represent the Council in participating in the Preparatory Committee. (3) The Preparatory Committee will refer to the precedent of presenting aircraft to express longevity wishes on the 50th birthday and properly formulate celebration measures to establish a more meaningful permanent memorial. (4) A telegram will be sent to the Provincial and Municipal Councils to proceed consistently.</p>
<p>In late September, more than 100 people from the Shanghai education and journalism circles, including Tang Zengzhi, Sun Dongcheng, Zhong Juemin, and Qian Fugong, suggested a "School Presentation and Longevity Wishes" plan. The main points are as follows: (1) Each province, city, county, and organization across the country should immediately establish a method for people to voluntarily donate funds and organize a "School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Committee" to facilitate the process. (2) People's donations should be entirely voluntary. The donation goal should be that each autonomous region in each province, city, and county should be able to add at least one national school. (3) On Chiang's birthday, each province, city, and county should separately present a list of the amount of donations and the units where national schools can be added directly to Chiang Kai-shek to express congratulations, and also publish it in newspapers to inform the public. (4) These national schools should uniformly be prefixed with the characters "Jieshi" [Chiang Kai-shek's given name] to show permanent commemoration. (5) These national schools should be completed by the end of this year and open simultaneously in early spring next year so that all out-of-school children and all illiterate people across the country can be rescued as soon as possible. (6) Donations other than cash, such as donating houses and land for school buildings and building school buildings, can be included.</p>
<p>Afterward, in order to expand the response to the longevity celebration movement, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education convened a talk session with district heads on October 3rd to discuss the methods of the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement, and exchanged opinions with each other. The results were: (1) Formulate a "Draft of Measures for School Presentation and Longevity Wishes". (2) Organize the "Shanghai All Circles School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement Committee" (later renamed Shanghai All Circles Celebration of Chairman Chiang's 60th Birthday Preparatory Committee).</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee held its first standing committee meeting in early October, authorizing Director-General Wu Kaixian to draft the Shanghai All Circles School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Measures. The School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Measures drafted by Wu are as follows: (1) All schools built by all circles in this city to celebrate longevity will uniformly be prefixed with the characters "Zhong Zheng" [meaning "Central Correctness," a common name for schools honoring Chiang Kai-shek], with the order determined by the sequence of presentation. (2) All school buildings built in this city to express longevity wishes will be used for the establishment of National Schools [elementary schools]. (3) The school buildings built will be divided into two types: six-grade National Schools and twelve-grade National Schools. (4) The construction cost of a six-grade school building is tentatively set at 10,000,000 yuan, and the construction cost of a twelve-grade school building is tentatively set at 20,000,000 yuan. (5) The base for building school buildings should be based on the principle of using existing public land, unclaimed wasteland, and land presented by the people, and private land may be leased or purchased when necessary. (6) The funds needed for building school buildings will be voluntarily presented by citizens of this city and various organizations and institutions. (7) In addition to being awarded medals or certificates by this committee, the amount of donations from citizens and organizations in this city will also be reported to the higher authorities for commendation in accordance with the Regulations on Rewarding Donations for Educational Purposes. (8) In addition to the rewards given to citizens or organizations in this city who donate to school construction in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article, their names or the names of the organizations will be engraved on stone tablets within the designated donated school to commemorate them permanently. (9) These measures have been adopted and implemented by the Shanghai All Circles Celebration of Chairman Chiang's 60th Birthday Preparatory Committee and have been submitted to the Municipal Government for the record.</p>
<p>Since the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement was initiated in this city, it has immediately received widespread response from all over the country. In the capital, citizens' organizations have held meetings and prepared for celebrations. At the municipal conference, it was resolved to launch the "Capital All Circles School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement" to eliminate illiteracy and popularize education. A meeting was held on October 8th, planning to present 60 schools, with an estimated cost of 6 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The Tianjin School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement also began simultaneously. The Tianjin School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Standing Committee was established on October 18th, launching a movement for each citizen to donate 1,000 yuan, and for public educators to donate one day's income. The deadline for collection was set for the 29th, and the number of schools to be presented will be determined based on the amount of funds raised.</p>
<p>In response to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement initiated by Shanghai, Mayor Dong of Shenyang specially instructed the Social Affairs and Education Bureaus to formulate specific measures for the Shenyang School Presentation and Longevity Wishes. It is said that it has been decided to present 60 schools.</p>
<p>The Qingdao Municipal Government plans to establish 50 national elementary schools and one science museum within the year to respond to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement. Wang Yaowu, commander of the Second Pacification Headquarters (now succeeded as Chairman of Shandong Province), convened a meeting of the heads of various headquarters on October 6th, resolving to raise 1 billion yuan in Qingdao to establish a Zhong Zheng Middle School to celebrate the Chairman's birthday.</p>
<p>On October 6th, the Hankou School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement Committee was established, and all circles responded enthusiastically. In the Zhongshan District alone, 1.07 million yuan has been donated, and the other districts are proceeding enthusiastically.</p>
<p>The Beiping Municipal Bureau of Education, in order to rescue out-of-school children, had previously worked with the Social Affairs Bureau to formulate a draft plan for the establishment and expansion of national schools, which was approved by the municipal government. Now, in response to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes, it is stepping up the implementation of the plan and expanding it.</p>
<p>The education community in Guangzhou has launched a donation drive based on each autonomous region in the city as a unit, for a total of 24 central schools, with an estimated fundraising goal of 200 million yuan.</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, in addition to the construction of Zhong Zheng primary and secondary schools by all circles in Hangzhou, alumni of the Zhejiang Military Academy also launched the establishment of the Hangzhou Zhong Zheng School to respond to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes.</p>
<p>The Shaanxi Provincial Party Headquarters, in order to celebrate the Chairman's birthday, specially launched a donation drive for all party members to donate one day's income to raise funds to run the most complete national elementary school. Detailed measures have been drafted.</p>
<p>All circles in Anhui have decided to present schools to express longevity wishes, setting up Zhong Zheng elementary schools in Anqing, Bengbu, Wuhu, and Hefei. In the other counties, the existing complete central national schools will be converted into Zhong Zheng elementary schools.</p>
<p>The Shanxi Provincial Youth League branch has also decided to set up a Zhong Zheng elementary school to celebrate Chiang's birthday.</p>
<p>Fujian Province has decided to hold charity donation and school presentation activities in all cities and counties throughout the province as a longevity celebration.</p>
<p>All circles in Ningxia Province responded to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes, voluntarily donating 140 million yuan to build two Zhong Zheng National Schools and establish 100 Zhong Zheng literacy schools for the masses.</p>
<p>The Gansu Province School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement decided that each county and city should present a national school and report the amount of the first batch of donation funds to the provincial government before October 18th.</p>
<p>Lu Daoxin, Chen Chuncui, and 22 other members of the Jiangxi Youth League and enthusiastic educators launched a response to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes, deciding to establish a middle school in Yichun, named "Jie Fu Middle School," taking the meaning of "repaying with great blessings, boundless longevity." They have already raised 50 million yuan for start-up expenses and plan to raise another 100 million yuan in funds.</p>
<p>Muslims in Xinjiang launched the establishment of an Islamic Zhong Zheng Middle School to respond to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes.</p>
<p>The recovered Mongolian banners in the Northeast and the Mongolian banners in Suiyuan and Rehe, in addition to presenting a banner combining Mongolian and Chinese characters for each banner, will also establish a complete elementary school, named Zhong Zheng Elementary School of a certain banner, to celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday.</p>
<p>The Changchun New Life Movement Association widely invited people from all walks of life on October 4th to discuss the response to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes and agreed on specific measures to actively carry out. Served as the commander of the 5th Regiment of the Shanghai Army. At the same time, overseas Chinese also responded one after another, donating money to present schools.</p>
<p>Looking at the enthusiastic response from the provinces and cities, it can be seen that "School Presentation and Longevity Wishes" is indeed a deeply meaningful move. National construction and revitalization should begin with education. Especially today, when out-of-school children are prevalent throughout the country, increasing the number of schools to improve the people's level of knowledge and cultivate the foundation of the next generation of national construction cadres is naturally the most urgent task and the best gift that the people can present to the Chairman.</p>
<p>Full Map of Chairman Chiang's Hometown, Fenghua Xikou (Specially Drawn by Our Newspaper's Reference Room)</p>
<h3>Eulogy for Expelling the Barbarians (with Preface)</h3>
<p>Glorious and vast is the Crimson Land, the true home of our Yellow Descendants. The domain of Yu is evenly distributed, the plains of Zhou are lush and fertile. Dwelling in the center of the world, the troubles on the borders have arisen since ancient times. Tracing back to the Xianyun, Quanrong, Xiongnu, Western Regions, Tubo, Huihe, Khitan, Jin, and Yuan, for four thousand years, they have brought disaster to China, disturbed the common people, and encroached upon our territory. However, before long, they were either subdued, defeated, or destroyed, and their lands were incorporated into our territory. Initially, they roamed freely like dogs and sheep, but eventually, the map of our land expanded daily. The nomadic people who lived in yurts were reclassified as registered households. The customs of both southern and northern peoples all adopted the correct calendar. This allowed us to spread our vast territory and numerous people with education and teachings, making the four neighboring peoples into one family and the five ethnic groups into one nation. Even to this day, it continues to grow larger, truly a gift from the Yi-Di barbarians. In between, there were instances of defeat followed by victory, of taking back what was once given away. Although one might say it was the will of Heaven, how could it be without human effort? The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were bright and wise. Shun and Yu received their mandates, consulting the almanac for their reigns. The Shang and Zhou dynasties underwent successions through generations, accumulating virtue and benevolence to possess the world. The Han Dynasty manifested the auspicious signs of the Red Emperor, and the Tang Dynasty recorded the auspicious omen of the Jin River. Even up to the Song and Ming dynasties, they all strived to maintain their rule and feared losing it. They all heeded the will of Heaven above and aligned with the hearts of the people below, listening to the people and receiving the mandate with reverence. Therefore, enlightened kings and wise rulers brought about repeated prosperity and harmony among the nine clans. Foreign peoples were drawn to our culture through multiple translations. Examining past strategies, how could it be said that it was all mere chance? China is a nation of divine descendants, the Central Land is a vessel of great potential. There has never been a case where someone without a foundation of inherited destiny or deeds of merit could usurp the realm through petty tricks like crowing like a rooster or thieving like a dog. If the people of China occupy the position of China, like Qin Shi Huang, Emperor Wen of Sui, Cao Cao, and Xiao Liang, they may possess great talent and ambition, but if they do not know how to love the people and cultivate virtue, then it is like a cauldron with broken legs or overturned food, and the great mandate will immediately collapse. How much more so should those who are of different kinds, alien species, island barbarians, and ferocious tribes, who seek to exploit weakness and danger, and covetously steal the divine artifacts, relying on their superior armor and weapons to fulfill their desires of theft and plunder, recklessly initiating war? If they truly wish to emulate the wisdom of the Jin and Yuan dynasties, they must assess their virtue and strength, spread benevolence and practice kindness, respect faith and value righteousness, and win over the hearts of the people. If they could truly do this, then China would be in danger. Summer insects cannot be spoken to of ice, and cicadas do not understand spring and autumn. Foolish barbarians, are there no people among you who are worthy of understanding these things? Instead, you are shallow, reckless, and rash, engaging in slaughter and arson, harboring wild schemes to expand territory, and committing acts of brutal killing and looting. Your ugly virtues and evil nature are exposed to the whole world. Gentlemen, therefore, know their demise is at hand. Their supreme generals and chieftains, mobilizing the forces of the entire nation, exhausting the wealth of several decades, entrusted with the expectations of a small and lowly people, engage in the actions of roving bandits like Chuang and Xian, yet they desire to dominate the multitudes of the nine provinces and receive the blessings of the gods. How could Heaven be so unkind as to use such people! Heaven is depriving them of their souls, which is a blessing for China. Although we are an old nation, our destiny is being renewed. The hearts of the people are not yet united, and our national defense is not yet strengthened. With a country unprepared, facing an enemy that has been lurking for a long time, responding hastily to the enemy, the disparity in strength is significant. At the beginning of the resistance against Japan in 1937, they had advantages while we were deficient, it was inevitable and reasonable. Heaven favors China and earnestly produces</p>
<p>General Chiang, placing himself amidst accumulated weakness, embracing righteousness in times of crisis, treading on thin ice, enduring wind and rain, diligently toiling, tirelessly all day long. The people of the world are sincerely and genuinely convinced, and all love</p>
<p>General Chiang as a patriot. Thereupon, all parties pledge their loyalty, all armies dedicate their lives, and the myriad people are united. Internal troubles are all eliminated. Those who are living destroy their homes to reward the troops, and those who are dead expose their bones without resentment. At this time, the opportunity for victory or defeat is so close, there is no room for error, and the outcome of victory or defeat can be foreseen.</p>
<p>General Chiang outwardly emulates the retreat of Qian You and inwardly drinks the pain of Zai Ju, enduring hardship and shouldering great burdens, not faltering and not shrinking back. He is reorganizing the army and strengthening the military, mobilizing troops and making oaths, carefully considering all matters, divinely planning the nine borders, improving and preparing, attacking and uniting. The second phase of the war has now been three years. Employing wisdom against the arrogant and expanding enemy, deciding victory after defeat, is it not exceedingly difficult? Then, if there were no</p>
<p>General Chiang, there would be no China. Without Guan Zhong, we would be wearing our robes on the left! Confucius said: "If he is truly benevolent, he is truly benevolent." In the early summer of 1939, he decided on a strategy to counterattack, and since then, he has used stillness to control movement, turning weakness into strength, and progressing from loss to gain, transitioning to the stage of counter-offensive. Consequently, there were the battles of Suizao, Changsha, and Nanning, and northern Guangdong. In the early summer of 1940, the counter-offensive became more vigorous, leading to victories in western Suiyuan, southern Jin, southern Guangxi, southern Guangdong, central Hubei, and northern Hubei. In the current year of 1941, there have been major victories in southern Henan, Yichang, and northern Jiangxi. Looking at the enemy's three battlefields in the north and south, stretching across ten provinces, starting from the desert, Yinshan Mountain, and Hexi areas in the north, crossing Yanmen and Daizhou to the Liaohe and Jieshi, extending along the Five Great Mountains and Four Great Rivers, traversing famous mountains, great rivers, rivers, lakes, and marshes, penetrating deep into Wu and Chu, gazing afar at the Lingbiao region, and reaching the remote borders of Jiaozhi and Zangke, the stench of their actions filled the sky wherever they went, rubble covered the ground, blood flowed like porridge, white bones piled up like mountains, famous cities turned into ruins, and cultural relics were reduced to ashes. The extent of their trampling, the cruelty of their destruction, the horror of their slaughter, and the pervasiveness of their occupation surpassed even Huang Chao and far surpassed the Jin and Yuan dynasties. Our army in the resistance war has inferior weapons and tactics, enduring and persevering, passing through years and seasons. Entering the second phase, military strength is gathering like clouds, elite troops are rising up together, the generals are all famous, and the soldiers are all elite. There are now three million soldiers, eight thousand miles of battle lines, sixty thousand engagements, and seven hundred thousand prisoners annihilated. Like fire and rushes, striking down with absolute certainty, this is truly a rare and great war of expelling the barbarians in the history of China! Since this war, we have transitioned from decline to prosperity, from weakness to strength, from laxity to vigor, and from danger to safety. The hearts of the people are becoming more steadfast, and the morale of the soldiers is becoming more fierce. How can we achieve this? If there were not a single person whose virtue is sufficient to convince people, and whose strength is sufficient to rally the masses, to lead them and guide them, who could achieve this? Not only this, but all administrative affairs are not chaotic or deficient, responding to changes as if they were ordinary, and responding to every move. This allows the generals to have no worries about the rear, and the soldiers to increase their morale. They become accustomed to long battles as if it were their nature, and they are fearless of strong enemies. Even the enemy knows to be astonished and submit. If there were no</p>
<p>General Chiang, there would be no China. Without Guan Zhong, we would be wearing our robes on the left! Confucius said: "If he is truly benevolent, he is truly benevolent." Yang Qi, a scholar from Dongwu in the region of Qi, was born in peaceful times. During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, when Qi was at the height of his strength, he once attended the seat of Li Wenzhong Gong. When discussing matters of the East, Gong Zhuang Rong spoke to Qi, saying: "A great war between China and Japan is inevitable. An early outbreak will result in a smaller disaster, and a late outbreak will result in a larger disaster. Remember my words, you will surely see it when you are old." Although China will certainly not perish, a person of great renown will surely be born into this world to take on this great responsibility, and it is not a matter of today. Unexpectedly, forty-five years later, in his old age, he witnessed the calamity of the southward crossing, displacement and wandering, and the chaos of the four seas. Tracing back to the Sino-Japanese War, at that time</p>
<p>General Chiang had already descended from Mount Song, and auspicious signs were evident in his youth. It can be seen that Heaven's will had already prepared for it, and bestowed a great responsibility upon</p>
<p>General Chiang. Until today, he has suffered in his heart, labored his muscles and bones, to accomplish great deeds. Therefore, the great war is inevitable, and China will certainly not perish, and it all depends on</p>
<p>General Chiang's hands. Wenzhong's words are still in my ears, and the matter is as clear as daylight. Looking at the present, I am filled with emotion, admiration, joy, and cannot contain myself. Therefore, I have collected the words from Jiao's Book of Changes and composed a eulogy for General Chiang's expulsion of the barbarians in advance. The eulogy says:</p>
<p>The dwelling of Fuxi, the southern mountain of Kuaiji, Yu summoned the feudal lords, the country produced benevolent and wise men. Holding jade scepters from ten thousand nations, the mechanism of peace, Heaven bestows a dark jade tablet, the South is greatly peaceful.

Yang Qi Yunshi from Jiangdong respectfully composed (July 7th, 1941, Republic of China)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Citizens' Public Birthday Wishes to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on His Sixtieth Birthday</h3>
<p>In 1946, the year following the complete victory of the Eastern Expedition, the citizens of Shanghai respectfully wished</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek a happy sixtieth birthday on October 31st. All the citizens of Shanghai thought of ways to express their wishes, and entrusted the task to the soldier Zhao to write an article. Zhao deliberated for a long time, believing that celebrating the birthday of a person was not an ancient custom, and celebrating the birthday of the head of a nation was even more unprecedented. Why do I say this? The head of state takes the universe as his home and the cosmos as his era, and the passage of sixty years is hardly enough to limit him. Moreover, his actions in establishing models and setting examples involve countless matters every day, each with its own context, and are by no means something that ordinary people can rashly point fingers at or arbitrarily offer blessings. However, the doctrine of Confucius is consistent, and the essence of the Five Emperors is only sixteen characters. We use simple words to infer complex meanings, and gain righteousness from simplicity, specifically speaking, from the</p>
<p>Chairman's standard of the New Life Movement, the four characters of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, extending to the rest. Establishing principles and unifying categories, all plans should be neither excessive nor deficient. Propriety is the opposite of punishment and aims to prevent problems before they occur. Righteousness means prohibiting the people from doing wrong. Integrity means not accepting anything improper. Shame means not doing anything dishonorable. These four virtues are all biased towards the negative, and they are the foundation for all things. Since ancient times, talented people have been self-assertive, fond of grandeur and eager for success, lightly regarding vague matters and neglecting small defects. Consequently, the mistakes that lead to legal punishments in small matters, and the disturbances that lead to chaos in the country in large matters, are countless. Only our</p>
<p>Chairman pays utmost attention to this, and planting the roots of inaction, he plants the fruits of action. Thus, he can destroy and clear away obstacles, achieving the great feat of revolution. Firm and unyielding, he brings a strong enemy to a miserable defeat. May I ask, during the eight years of the war, our military equipment was far inferior to that of the enemy, and in the early stages, the country shrank day by day, by more than a hundred miles. Yet, through hardship and perseverance, and the inability of peace talks to shake his resolve, he ultimately achieved complete victory, creating a central force. In ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, who can compare to him as a leader who stands out from the crowd? Emperor Gaozu of Han established his empire in five years, and his deeds were similar to territorial expansion. Washington led thirteen states to independence without any major battles. These accomplishments pale in comparison. In the past, Zhang Jiucheng said to Emperor Gaozong of Song, "I wish Your Majesty would be steadfast and magnanimous in heart, and not be discouraged by alarm and worry." These two sentences seem like platitudes, but in essence, besides our</p>
<p>Chairman, who else can truly embody them? As a result, Emperor Gaozong, with the fully prosperous situation of the Northern Song Dynasty, brewed a situation of partial peace. Our</p>
<p>Chairman, from our status as a semi-colonial country, has ascended to the ranks of powerful nations. What kind of cause yields what kind of effect? It is as clear as the sun and the moon, and it is by no means accidental. Shanghai is the birthplace of the revolution, and the citizens are close and devoted followers. They deeply understand the righteousness and believe that the greatest way to celebrate is to proclaim the supreme virtue and the essential principles to the world and future generations. Therefore, I, Zhu Mu, bow and speak.</p>
<p>Respectfully written by Zhang Shijian</p>
