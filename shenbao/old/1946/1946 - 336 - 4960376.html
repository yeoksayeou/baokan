<h3>憲草即可開始審查　國大今舉行第六次大會　討論分組及名單等問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕國大第六次大會二日舉行，上午十時至十二時由白崇禧主席，下午三時至六時由白雲梯主席。主席團由第一組蔣中正、胡適、張厲生、谷正綱、阿合買提江、孔祥熙、黃國書、丁惟汾、郭仲隗。田烱錦輪値，大會議事日程除對憲草廣泛發表意見外，將根草審査委會組織辦法，討論分組及名單問題，可能自三日起即開始分組審査。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕國大代表聯誼會一日晨十時在國大第一招待所舉行聯誼會，出席三百餘人，由孔庚。孫慕迦等發言，情况熱烈，重要決定如下：（一）確定行憲時期，（二）擬訂五五憲草修正稿，（三）請大會延期討論憲草兩星期，據傳如仍按國府公布憲草，彼等擬自行制憲。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕關於國大代表任期，頃據張代表濟傳談稱：國大組織法固曾規定會期終了代表任務亦即終了，然此由大會所規定行憲日期將來倘因情勢所趨而必須變更時，究由何人決定，國府係行使治權之最高機關，並非人民行使政權之最高機關，顯然無權變更國大之決，　因而在法理上仍須今日之代表重新予以決議，故國大代表任期至行憲時終止，在事實上方合邏輯。</p>
<p>〔又電〕國大秘書處一日上午十時舉行業務會報，檢討一月來工作，洪秘長蘭友親自主持，對各單位工作人員之辛勞，表示嘉慰，並勉各同人今後應加倍努力，以赴事功。本日會報中，各單位曾就本身業務提出問題，均經洪氏分別予以指示。</p>
<h3>成立廿三周年紀念　青年黨發表宣言　說明對時局及憲草意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕二日爲靑年黨成立廿三周年紀念日，該黨定二日上午士一時半舉行記者招待會，報吿該黨歷史。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕二日爲中國靑年黨廿三週年耙念日，該黨中央執行委會頃發表宣言，說明該黨對時局態度及對憲草意見，略謂：現在憲法由討論以進於完成，巳指日可期，我們相信，大多數國大代表來自民間，必能深悉人民厭亂望治的心理，所制定的憲法，必爲平正通達，能够促進國大，團結人民福利的民主憲法，而非偏畸固執召亂而不能止亂的反民主憲法。但憲法的制定，不過國家大政之一端，在憲法由議定頒布以至於實施的巾間過渡時期，民困倒懸，百端待舉，如何刷新政治，穩定金融，恢復交通，促進生產，由內政的整理，以提高國際地位，保障世界和平，凡此諸端，俱須全國各政黨及社會賢達協力同心，懸鵠以赴。本黨建黨目標，對外爲爭取國家的統一與獨立，對內則爲爭取人民的自由與平等，此二目的苟能以和平手段取得，則不惜任何代價，以爭取和平，苟不能以和平手段取得時，則不惜以任何代價，從事革命。瀋陽事變後，本黨懍於國難嚴重，以保障國家生存獨立爲先，始與瑚野各政黨携手言歡，共同從事神聖抗戰，勝利後，外患威脅暫已减除，而民主規模亟待締造，乃又與朝野政黨聚首一堂，由協商以進於共同制憲，期爲國家樹立長治久安的基礎，廿三年以來，本黨所蘄求之目標，雖次第實現，而前途艱難猶存，國家統一與獨立尙須完成，人民自由平等權利更待保障，本黨同志所以不敢自懈其責任者，以此，今天全國人民所期望是國家的和平，建設人民的安居樂業，要達到此二目的，必須斷然結束卅五年來內憂外患，戰亂相尋的動盪局面，迅速制定全國公認的憲法，在憲政基礎之上，完成民主的統一，庶可使國家基礎漸趨穩固，和平建設始可有期。本黨在抗戰時期，旣與朝野各黨共同努力，以奠定勝利的基礎，在此勝利初臨，建設方始之際，又豈能自卸其責任，是以在此次制憲的國民大會召集之始，本黨斷然主張參加，且期全國各政黨領袖，社會賢達共同參加，使民主憲法早日完成，人民福利得有保障，本黨同人共信此種希望不僅代表一黨一派意見，實爲全國最大多數人民的共同心理，任何民主的政黨，不可不了解眞正民意，亦不可不依據此民意而決定自己的行動。</p>
<h3>馬超俊昨招待　全體職業代表</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕中央農工部長馬超俊，一日下午三時半，假中央黨部招待全體國大職業代表到王曉籟，陸京士，溫少鶴等百餘人。馬超俊致詞，對憲章中無職業代表制規定一點，深表遺憾。據謂，職業代表制在我國有久遠之歷史，國父民國九年在廣州任非常大總統時，即倡導此種制度，並會予以實施。翌年廣州市參議會成立，一部份代表即係由職業團體選出者，其後國父北上，發表宣言，召開國民會議，該會於民國二十年在京召開，即有職業軍隊及婦女等代表。廿一年之選舉法，亦將職業代表之地位確定，各地議會亦多有由職業團體選出之代表參加，所惜抗戰時期之參政會，竟無職業代表，中外人士莫不引爲憾事。國父於二十年前即已提倡此種進步制度，可見其目光之遠大。蓋農工商爲立國最重要之份子，黨政軍僅爲治國之份子，若僅有區域代表而忽視職業代表，則下情勢將無由上達，而一切權力則將完全操縱於資產階級。特殊階級、與土豪劣紳之手，而形成一種不平等之現象。本人提倡職業代表制最早，希望此次憲法能有最進步之制度列入。更盼將來省市縣參議會中，亦能有職業代表參加。馬氏語畢，即由各代表陸續發言，咸主對此點應予力爭。王曉籟以全國商聯會理事長資格，報吿與各方接洽經過。據稱：將主席日則召見時，渠曾面陳此種希望，盼國大勿忘立國根本之農工商，決不可將其輕視或隨便予以處置，蓋農工商所選出之代表，才是眞正人民代表，欲謀國家富强，決不可捨本逐末，置職業代表於不顧。</p>
<h3>李業已出院　左生等抵滬</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕靑年黨國大代表揚永浚、左舜生兩氏，先後由京返滬，料理私事。一日左氏語記者，憲草訂正稿提交國大討論後，會塲中發生兩種不同意見，一部分認該訂正稿僅能代表政協各黨派意見，需要修正之點尙多，一部分仍堅持以五五憲草作藍本。靑年黨代表對此始終未發言，擬在審査會中再行表示意見。記者詢對今後國民參政會之存在與否，作何觀測，渠稱：本屆國民大會閉幕後，距離行憲尙有一段時期，在此期間，國民參政會似仍有存在之必要，且職權亦宜擴大，俾使民意機關之效能，得以充分發揮。左氏定今晚乘夜車晋京，繼續參加國大。又楊永浚氏亦定日內晋京。又據吳天民醫師稱：李璜已於一日下午出院，病體完全康復，何日赴京尙未決定。另據有關方面消息：李氏病中確曾赴抗一行，作短期旅行療養，幷無其他任務。</p>

<h3>上海暴徒騷動事件　吳市長廣播演詞全文</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晚八時吳市長假大西路三號上海廣播電台，報告前昨二天暴徒乘機騷擾情形，及市府戡　安良之緊急措施，並令全市商店今日起照常營業。如仍有暴徒企圖搗亂及危害治安者，格殺不論。吳市長於下午七時三　偕市府總務處長歐陽遵詮，新聞發佈處處長朱處白及靜安寺警察分局局長周蔚庭至電台，由該台科長陳彬招待，略事休息。八時正市長開始廣播，歷時三十四分鐘始畢。全文如下：「各位市民，本人現向全市市民報吿，昨天與今天本市所發生之騷動情形，暴徒借機擾亂公共秩序，使各位及各商店，受到損毀與侮辱，本人當首先對各位表示十二萬分之同情。關於騷動之經過及市府處理此事件之方針如下；（一）先自</p>
<p>攤販問題　講起。當本年七月間，市政會議通過，以黃浦老閘二區交通擁擠，決定取締攤販。蓋市府對大衆之利益，必須顧到。在本年九月以前，市中心區之交通常被阻塞，少則半小時，甚至有延續一二小時者，市民之行動，均惑不便。中區交通經改善後，已有顯著的進步。上海爲國際觀瞻所繫，各方亦僉認交通太無秩序，非改美不可。但如中區之攤販，不予取締，則交通阻礙情况，必難改善。當決定取締攤販時，亦曾充分顧及彼等之生計問題，故給予八·九·十·三個月之限期，勸令於此時期內，遷地營業，或另謀生計。市府一方面固須顧到攤販的生計，另一方面尤須顧到大多數市民的利益，力謀保持秩序。故取締攤販，在政府實有不得已的苦衷。（二）暴徒以攤販問題爲藉口，散佈謠言，稱被拘攤販送衣食被拒絕，致有凍死餓死情事。並謠稱，黄浦分局開槍</p>
<p>打死人民。此點余須加以申明，市府推行政令，爲謀公衆利益。警局奉令執行，而於執行時亦極緩和。原定十月底取　完畢，然今日已爲十二月一日，足見警局之執行，並不甚嚴厲。但政令之推行，必須澈底，中外報紙對攤販之不能如期取締盡凈，曾指責市府推行政令不力。至警局對攤販之處罰，第一第二兩次違章設攤者處以罰款，第三次始予拘押。在拘押期間，警局供給飲食。如家屬送衣送食，祇須遵守秩序，排隊進去，決無拒絕情事。暴徒散謠謂，在拘留所內，有攤販餓死凍死，昨日本人與市參議員及新聞記者多人，曾同往黄浦分局査間察看，絕無此事。杜分局長並願以性命爲担保，如有凍餓而死者，願受極刑。如各位査出確有其事，並提出證據者，儘管吿發，決可照杜分局長之担保辦理。昨並有謠稱，警局開鎗擊死人民。更絕無其事，完全爲暴徒造謠，企岡激動民衆情緒，以遂其</p>
<p>暴動陰謀　又傳黃浦分局有虐待被拘捕販等情形。果有此事，政府必予澈査。惟本人昨往該分局査問察看後，亦可保證並無外傳之虐待情事。（三）對昨今兩日暴動査察之結果，攤販決不能作此有計劃有組織之暴動，並危害及社會秩序及各位生命財產之安全。昨日下午在黃浦分局前之羣衆曾稱：尙有三百餘攤販被拘在該分局內。但所有攤販，於上午十二時前，業已全部釋放。本人於下午五時到該分局拘留所査看時，已無一攤販在內。足證此包圍分局之羣衆，並非攤販，而爲暴徒。此爲可證明者一。黄浦老閘兩區背叛代表四人、今天自己到我家裏來，申明昨日下午之　動搗毁商店。搗毁車輛，</p>
<p>阻斷交通　以及放火等不法行爲。與他們毫無關係。並稱他們昨日下午只到參　會請願，根本未到黄浦分局請願。則在黄浦分局前者，當然可證明不是攤販，此可證明者二。該四代表曾親筆寫一聲明，原文巳交中央社發表，明日可見報。昨日在南京路北京路搗毁交通車輛及商店時，曾捕獲肇事者多人。經詢明皆非攤販，此可證明者三。凡此所述，足證昨今兩日之暴動，與攤販完全無關。（四）昨今兩日之暴動，暴徒分股分路綫，到處擾亂社會治安，擾亂各位之安寗。試問攤販有無此組織能力？足證此爲有組織有計劃之擾亂公衆治安暴行，絕非攤販所爲，至爲顯然。（五）太人於昨日已感覺暴徒欲圖破壞社會秩序，造成慘案。其整們目的，欲壓迫</p>
<p>警察開槍　借故生事。故昨日本人嚴令各分局絕對忍耐，免予暴徒藉口，於黑夜危害無辜民衆，而造成彼等所企圖造成之慘案。當時我軍警力量，原足立即解決此項暴動。但昨晚警察所開者皆屬空槍，以防止給予暴徒藉口。而暴徒反因之而將其身份完全暴露。如果攤販有何要求，儘可向市府·市參議會。或行政院請願。即包圍警察局，甚至包圍市政府，亦均無不可。何以要搗毁商店，搗毁汽車，阻斷公共交通，並將東新橋高生大紙舖內，一切機器材料拖出縱火焚燒。此完全爲暴露彼等之暴動計劃，危害社會秩序，危害人民之安寧，使商店不敢開店營業，以</p>
<p>恐怖政策　威脅各位。凡此種種，普通攤販敢做嗎。此種非法行爲，試問政府應吾予以嚴厲的處置？（六）攤販問題已吿解決，可在公有或私有空地，集中設攤營業，攤販方面，亦已表示滿意。此次事件，已成爲暴徒危害公衆治安，危害人民安寗之暴動。政府之責任，爲保障人民生命財產之安全，不客任何人在市內　　將人民　車輛中拖下，拋石子，拿東西，縱火焚燒等種種不法行爲。上海之戒嚴令，並未取消，以前爲瀕及市民之便利，未照戒嚴法嚴格實行，今後如有損及人民生命財產，危書公共秩序者，決依照戒嚴法從　處置。</p>
<p>格殺不貸　（七）全市軍營有絕對力量，控制上海安全。爲保障全市市民之安寗，對不法暴行，政府必加以制裁。今晚五時後，全市已安謐無事，警備司令部制暴茲亂佈吿發出後，決不許再有强迫關店，阻斷交通等情事發生。明日各位可照常營業，政府對各位之生命財產，絕對予以保障。至於市政府對市民之基本態度，厲行民主主義。本人與市府全部人員均爲公僕，全市市民爲我們之主人。市府必以各位之福利爲福利。暴徒殺人放火，危害各位利益，故必須嚴辦。國民黨執政的政府，決非軍閥時期可比。國民黨員是人民之公僕，歷爲人民服務。本人之部屬，無論是公務員或警察，如有對各位禮貌不週或虐待詐財等情事，儘可隨時向本人報吿，並隨時指敎，太人必虛心領受。否則我便不配做本市市長，更不配做國民黨的黨員了。在此時局動盪之時，市府爲謀</p>
<p>市民福利　及全市商業之興　，一切施政，決以大多數人利益爲前提，如施行物價評價，即因不以少數人之利益，而妨礙及大多數人之利益。此完全爲全市四百五十萬市民着想。本人設非如此做，各位可隨時舉發，向中央控吿。本人願受應得之罪。故倘有少數人，企圖擾亂社會治安，妨礙公共秩序而有暴動的行爲，市府不能不採取斷然的處置。昨今之事，市府之處置，已使企圖暴動者無所藉口。而暴動者之行爲，決不爲大衆所同情。自明日起，務望工商學各界，照常在工廠做工，在商店營業，在學校安心讀書，並希望全市市民大家放心。</p>

<h3>近東政局的新動態</h3>
<p>在四外長會議對於特港及多瑙河問題，甫得協議，聯合國大會對於普遍裁軍問題，因蘇聯同意施行國際管理及監察制度，已開始着手進行的時候，中東阿刺伯與其鄰近諸國，又產生出種種糾紛。據中央社昂哥拉廿八日消息，外的但國王阿拉布林造成「大叙利亞」國的野心又重行燃燒。沙地阿刺伯已經表示繳烈反對，並以軍隊開入外的但，傳已發生小戰鬥。同時希臘外交部秘書長及土耳其外交部秘書長，均前往外的但。外約但的問題，雖然是星星之火，但是因爲國際背景的關係，如不早日防止，也可以燎原，造成不可收拾的局面。</p>
<p>外約但的問題和整個中東及巴爾幹的問題，不僅是領土的科紛，而且也是國際的衝突。英國自從第二次世界大戰結束以來，在中東及巴爾幹的勢力，逐漸崩潰。同時蘇聯在中東和巴爾幹的勢力，却逐漸增加。除非英國決心全部撤退，否則她必然要用全力競爭。英國競爭的表現：第一是巴勒斯坦不偏袒猶太人；第二是土耳其韃靼尼爾海峽反對由蘇土共同防衛；第三是扶持希臘政府；第四是英國駐在埃及的軍隊不肯撤退；第五是對伊朗油田，以武力保護；第六是煽動有野心的外的但國王，以建立一個「大敘利亞國」。所以外的但的事件，不過是整個中東和巴爾幹問題的一環，此環一動，其餘各環，均受影響。這也就是希土兩國的外交部秘書長都到外的但去的原因。　中東的阿刺伯聯盟，得英國帮助而成立的，以討好阿刺伯人的歡心。但是因爲巴勒斯坦猶太人移民問題，阿刺伯人對英國漸失好惑，英國再不能運用。因此她想扶助外的但國王，建設「大叙利亞國」，將巴勒斯坦，叙利亞，黎巴嫩，伊拉克，並地中海及波斯灣油田，打成一片。假如這一個計劃成功，阿刺伯各民族，就可以聯合造成一個偉大的勢力，鄰近的希臘和土耳其，因爲利害的關係，自然也要加以支持，至於野心勃勃的外約但國王更不用說、願意利用一切的力量，來建設這個偉大王國的實現。</p>
<p>阿刺伯民族，雖然在歷史上曾經有過高度的文化，但是隨着軍事力量的式　，文化逐漸落後。現在經濟是落後的，民皆是淺陋的，眞正的政權，都在少數極端專制的沙漠部落酋長們的手中。他們所有一切的土地，對部落人民有至高無上生殺宰割的威權。他們的性恪，兇横剽　。他們是議會的當然代表，在議塲中，每人都帶上兩隻手槍，每當辯論激烈的時候，不惜拔槍相向，會議頓時鬧散。</p>
<p>外的但的國王，就是這樣部落酋長中較大的一個。我們可以推想，像這樣一位頭腦簡單，性情兇暴的民族領袖，傳統英雄的思想是很發達的，同時也是最容易受人利用的，而且野心一經發動，再得着物資軍火的接濟，也很難臨崖勒馬的。在另外一方面，反對他的領袖們也具有同樣的性情。所以外的但國王的野心剛一暴露，沙地阿刺伯立刻官稱：「將不事猶豫，以武力粉碎此種野心」，並且以兵力開入外的但。這塲熱鬧戲，現在導演成功，已經開始上演了，到底什麽時候可以演完呢？</p>
<p>對於阿刺伯人，英美蘇一直都在爭取，但是他們的方法，各有巧妙不同。美國的方法，是辦教育，送留學生，設醫院，宣傳西方科學和美國式的民主主義；現在這些受過美國敎育的份子，對美國人都有好感。蘇聯專事拉攏下層階級，對他們遇事同情幫助，藉此宣傳蘇聯式的民主主義。英國人却專門和會長親善，資助他們軍火，鼓動他們的野心，同他們深相結納。在一個民智水準甚低的國家，比較起來說，美蘇的方法都嫌迂緩，英國的方法，最易成功。但是在緊張的時期，蘇聯也可以採取英國的方法。</p>
<p>我們對於阿刺伯民族，不能不表示深摯的憐憫與同情。因爲一個民族，受人利用，作人傀儡，自殺殘殺，是人類的悲劇。這樣的悲劇，現在不僅發生在外的但和鄰近何拉伯的各國，就是在印度，在希臘，在朝鮮，在伊朗，在埃及都正在激烈進行過去西班牙式的鬥爭。假如世界政治家，眞正有悲天憫人的胸懷，謀取世界和平的決心，就應當及早放棄爭覇的陰謀，讓世界各國民族，自由處理他們內部的爭執。同時各國民族的領袖，也應當以人民爲重，反躬自問，不再倚仗外援動輒爭地爭城，稱兵好亂，驅迫民衆，屠殺自己的同胞。人類應當是有理性的，只有根據理性的行動，纔可以獲得眞正的成功，人類世界纔可以永久和平相處。</p>

<h3>論憲草中之國民大會</h3>
<p>— 陳茹玄</p>
<p>根據政治協商會議所商決原則而訂定之「中華民國憲法草案修正案」，（又稱爲五五憲草修正案），業經以最迅速方法，完成立法程序，由國府提送國民大會，作爲討論藍本。全文共十四章，都爲百五十有一條。對於五五憲草改善之處頗多。如對人民之自由權利，採用積極保護方式，取消「非依法律不受限制」原有之字句；並嚴定中央限制該項自由之立法範圍，以防濫用立法權，剝奪人民之權利。又如立法委員改由直接民選，俾地方民意與國家立法機關息息相通；所有法律，俱足代表民意，立法院不致有官僚化或政府機關化之弊。省長不由中央指派，而由各省人民直接選舉；俾地方人民有自擇其行政管理人之目由。省長已由省民選出，當然受選民罷免；其對省民公意，自必加以尊重，期博取省民之擁戴，不敢肆意妄爲，千犯衆怒，以自毁其地位。較諸由中央任免之省長，只求敷衍中央法令，取容於頂頭上司，便可頤指氣使，不顧人民死活者，自爲進步多多。「基本國策」一章，將國家之經濟，財政，軍事，國防，敎育，外交等大端歸納一處，並分別作重要方針之指示，提綱挈領，言簡意賅。較諸五五憲草之分擴專　，顧此失彼者，亦實勝一籌。他如明定司法院爲解釋憲法之　關，使司法院成爲類似美國之大理院爲「憲法之保護人」。提高司法之地位，統一解釋之大權，免玩法者之曲解以自便，允稱至當。又如領土一章，五五憲草採用列舉式，將各省區名稱盡入憲法條文；至於今日，外蒙獨立，台灣改省，東三省變爲九雀，憲草條文便須更改。故修正案易爲概括式曰「中華民國領土依其固有之疆域」，俾條文富有伸縮性，亦一進步之修正也。</p>
<p>至於修正案中，與五五憲草不同之點尙有硏究之必要者，竊據管見，亦有數端。茲先舉其最重要者二三事，作分析比較之檢討，並推尋其法理之淵源，與其制度精神之所寄托，以供留心憲法同人之省覽，若夫得失之林，則見仁見智，讀者擇焉。（一）國民大會權力之縮小：五五憲草規定國民大會以令國谷區域直接民選之代表組織之；而修正案則於區域代表之外，將中央之立法委員，及監察委員全部加人，並將立法委員改由直接民選，監察委員則由各省市議會分選。（五五憲草規定立監兩委均由國大選出）。如此，則立法，監察兩院委員在治權方面則各爲五院之一，在政權方面又爲國民大會之代表，於國大閉會時，可代表國大，監督政府，正如國大之常設機關焉。至於國民大會之職總，在五五憲草所列舉者，爲選舉，罷免，創制，複決，及修改憲法五項；而選舉罷免權之所及爲總統，副總統，立法院院長，副院長，監察院院長，副院長，立法委員，監察委員等。凡屬中央之法律，皆得由國大創制複決；立法之修改自亦在創制複決權之內，因其性質較爲重要，故爲特列一項。修正草案對於國大職權，則大加减削；選舉罷　種僅能行於總統及副總統；各院院長委員均被除外；創制複次權亦以修改憲法爲限，不及於中央一切法律，必俟全國過半數縣市均能行使創制複決兩權時，國民大會始得行使。照此辦法，則在盡政開始後之若干時期，國民大會僅爲一選舉總統之機構，（修改憲法及罷免俱極不常有之事）立法院對於一切法律案之議決權，不受任何方面之牽制或監督。除總統在某種情形之下可以請求覆議，及司法院在發現法律與憲法某條衡突時得宣告其違憲外，國民大會既不能要求複決，自亦無權過問，故國高於一切，揣起草者之憲，以爲立法委員與國大代表同是民選（草案第六十二條立法院由民選委員組織），而立委又同時兼爲國大代表；一方面代表人民，一方面又可代表國大。故會院之間，意見必不致兩歧。立法院所議決之法律，當然爲國民大會所同意，在此情形之下，複決權可以不必使用。此稱看法，未免過於理想。蓋同爲民選代表，而意見往往絕不相容。同爲一黨議員，而內閣與國會往往勢不兩立，事實之昭示吾人者，隨處皆是。茍不予人民以表示意見之機會，誰能保證立法機關之一切法議，必能盡符公意。在五權制度之下，國民大會之唯一職責，在於代表國民，管制政府。立法權爲政府權之至大者，人民雖不自行立法，但人民得用複決權或創制權以管制立法。今人民對中央法律事實上已無法創制複法，對立法委員亦未能行使罷免；而代表人民之國民大會，又無此權爲之代申意見，則立法院豈不成爲天上地下，惟我閩尊之機構。萬一監用職權，產生惡法，非俟三年改選；即無法補救，其危險寗堪設想？世界議會政治國家，行政首長對立法機關有解散權；而其議會本身，亦大都分爲上下兩院，互相監督，反覆討論，以求週密。此其用意，即在於防止立法專制之流弊。五五憲草規定國民大會對立法委員有罷免權，對法律案有複決權，其用意亦在此。愚覺實有未可抹殺之處也。至於立法，監察兩院委員，同時兼任國大代表，每六年集會一次選舉總統，似係抄襲法蘭西以國會上下兩院議員合組國民會議選舉總統之成規。（所不同者，草案中之國大代表，除立監兩委外，再加區域代表若干而已。）其方法較直接民選目屬簡單；就實用方面言，亦尙無窒碍難行之處。特立監兩委，在國府則爲行使治權者；在國大則爲行使政權者，資格兩重　威風八面，與中山先生政治權宜分別行使之理論，稍在出入耳。</p>
<p>綜是觀之，修正案中之國民大會，就組織方面言，似較五五憲草之規定者爲　大而複雜；就職權方面言，則較五五憲草之規定爲簡略而脆弱·且因創制·複決·兩權之暫缺，使立法院成爲一個不受管制之機關，因選舉罷免權之僅及總統，故對。各院長官，無法發生關係或施行任何指導監督。此稱國民大會，只能當作選舉總統之機構而已，故六年開會一文，每次集會數日，其任務即可終了。此其與五五憲草將國民大會爲管制政府之樞紐者，地位輕重，逈然不同，是則最堪注意者也。</p>
<h3>我前任駐荷大使　董霖談荷蘭政情　新貨幣政策成績斐然</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕前任駐荷大使董霖，前自任所返國述職，三十日晨抵京，即赴外部謁王部長，甘次長乃光，報吿使荷經過，董氏使荷將滿兩年，以不慣荷蘭之低濕氣候，曾患風濕症，現將調部服務。渠今晨於寓邸接見記者，暢談荷蘭政情稱：荷蘭因多數人民竭誠擁載王室，政治相當安定，議會中目前以天主敎黨及工黨勢力較大，內閣即係由該兩黨聯合組成，極富民主作風。經濟方面，荷蘭於戰時遭受德人破壞甚烈，戰後以政治安定，及人民對復員工作之努力，水電設備，生產機構及各項水利設施，大體均已恢復，目前境內之淡水淹區業已開始耕種，鹹水淹區之種植，則尙待完成。當戰爭結束之際，荷人亦感通貨膨脹之苦，政府乃採取新貨幣政策，即將人民之舊幣全數收入國庫，戰時非法旣得利益則沒收之，並淸算各存戶之應付所得稅額；其後政府即以同値新幣立戶，而凍結於國家銀行內，政府則依據存戶是否爲生活必需，而決定分期提款數額，非經批准，不得提取。是項規定，自去年九月施行結果，一年之內，成績斐然，遊資因以歛跡，更佐以定量分配制度之嚴格實行，乃使供求得以適應，經濟恢復常態。</p>
<p>董氏繼述荷蘭之對外貿易及中荷通商展望稱：「荷蘭對外貿易，因東印度情勢混亂，及對德貿易不能恢復，已遠遜戰前，荷政府現與歐洲各國訂立貨幣及貿易協定，並與盧森堡訂立關稅同盟，對外貿易已漸有起色。至中荷貿易，因交通阻隔，目前尙難論及，惟荷蘭各大公司業經派有代表抵滬，一俟海運暢通，常將有所發展」。</p>
<p>大使嗣稱；「關於華僑目前在荷蘭本部者，約千五百餘人，中有海員數百人，政府會向荷方交涉，早日遣送彼等返國；荷蘭水利工程，聞名世界，若千東印度華僑學生，就學荷蘭，亦均頤返回祖國工作。」</p>
<p>大使最後强調巾荷邦交，今後必可日臻鞏固，荷闌人士對中國文化，素極仰慕，若干技術人員，並表示願來華工作。海牙現設有中荷協會，亦致力於山荷文化之交流。</p>

<h3>無錫公審「控奸專家」　楊濟良竟以誣控漢奸爲業　法庭上言詞鏗鏘矢口否認</h3>

<p>昨日上午十時許，即由法警至看守所，將楊宗英簽提到案，楊身材魁梧，穿玄褐色之布棉袍，態度至爲鎭靜，在候審室，楊妻曾往接見談話，楊妻體格瘦小，與楊對立，相形之下，一大一小，一長一矮，一則容光煥發，（氣色不像吃官司），面色似乎白了些，意氣自豪，大有死人不關之槪，一則面容憔瘁，愁眉不展，頻呼奈何奈何，一對畸形夫妻相會，令人可憐亦復可笑可恨，楊宗英旋在手指上勒下金戒一枚（約重三錢左右）給付其妻，謂沒有事體了，現在有新發現等語。</p>

<p>言詞鏗鏘流利’推事竟無話可以難倒，畢竟是打官司老手，楊當庭竝呈上其自撰之辯訴書，至是，庭上乃諭令楊宗英在口供筆録上捺指印，楊收受供錄，看過一遍，與所供無訊，才捺指印，楊還押，展期再訊。</p>

<p>本鎭位於浦東其昌棧，所有菜攤，設於街道之旁，歷有數十餘年，市面熱鬧，皆賴於此。此地極少車輛通過，故於交通，全無妨碍。太年七月問忽奉警局飭令，所有菜攤，一律遷移至一七七弄內，査該弄是一條極狹小之泥弄，只有一面房子，長而不滿三十間門面，並無遮柵陰溝等設備，每逢下雨，泥濘不堪，菜販無法安擺，於是沿街呌賣，價格以致高低不一。加之嚴冬將屆，地面將吿結凍，待値上市之際，冰凍始熔，形同雨天，致使市民苦不堪言。市面繁榮，大受應響。</p>
<p>再者，警局目的是爲正觀市容，而所有經售洋獲棉布雜貨等非菜攤者，仍設於街旁，東一堆，西一攤，很是紊亂，又如洋涇十八間塘橋，楊家渡·花園石橋等菜攤，仍設於街道之旁，乃獨令我等向隅，深望警局體念小民，收回成命。（市民陸浩生）</p>
<h3>公共汽車路綫商榷</h3>
<p>頃閱貴報「公用局擬闢第九十兩路公共汽車增進市民交通便利」，曷勝歡迎，惟關於第十路公共汽車假定路綫，讀者以爲頗有考慮之處。按戰前本市公共汽車，縱連横貫，以事實需要爲主。一年以來，賴當局之努力建設，原有路綫泰半均已次第恢復，惟外灘至楊樹浦，九路公共汽車獨付闕如，目今該地交通僅賴獨一之八路電車，擁擠不堪，交通不便已達極點。一旦遇有撞章或電綫損壞，則一無交通工具。竊意以楊樹浦路綫之長，（全程及外灘至兆豐花園之一倍又四分之三），東區人口之衆，（近逾百萬），及交通工具之最爲缺乏，在增進市民福利之原則上，殊有早日恢復九路公共汽車之必要。揆之第十路規擬之假定路綫：由兆豐花園經南京路至外灘，該段現已有自外灘至江蘇路之公共汽車行駛其間，雖終點不同而相距咫尺，不能謂不便利，况外灘至靜安寺之間，電車汽車，重重疊疊，已有數路並肩而行，復以南京路之擠，再加公共汽車，路道益狹，交通益擠，而實際需要反不若滬東之爲殷切，衡量實情，爲特呼籲將第十路改駛外灘至楊樹浦底似較切合實際需要。（周德生）</p>
<h3>上川火車擅自漲價</h3>
<p>浦東上川火車客票價目，已自十一月十六日起漲爲百分之一百，所漲倍數超過電車公共汽車。際此交通工具缺少之時，貧苦商旅頗有負担增重之苦。乃閱廿一日貴報本埠新聞所載，公用局長趙會珏在參議會中報吿：謂上川火車漲價尙未核准云云，不勝託異，爲籲請公用局，對祇知圖利擅自漲價之上川火車公司，予以懲儆，並將票價核减，以惠平民，而維政府威信，至私自溢收票價，亦須責令該公司繳出移捐慈善機關，以昭公允。（顧蔭梧）</p>
<h3>處置瘋犬辦法</h3>
<p>最近本市瘋犬噬人，傷的死的，日有見聞，惟當局迄無適當處置，因之，蔓延更烈，被害愈多，人心惶惶，嘖有煩言</p>
<p>筆者以爲防止瘋犬，首先劃清責任，最好　由衛生局辦理家犬登記，登記時發給犬牌及口罩，同時注射瘋犬預防疫苗。其未登記未　懸犬牌或未套口罩的，一律自謂野犬，由警察局執行捕殺，同時民政處着各保各甲，按戶曉諭，共同防止，以收事功。（潘伯升）</p>
<h3>調訓公共汽車人員</h3>
<p>前據　者章致遠君投函本報，述及公共汽車激動乘客咒詛事，在本欄刊出後，頃得上海市公共交通公司籌備員會交通組來函內開：「査上月六路公共汽車各司機，爲對於待遇有未能滿意，曾有一次車輛自起點站開出後在中途故意逗留，遲緩前進，致成數輛啣接行駛，經査悉後立將爲首起意者予以相當徵處，爲治本辦法，並將待遇酌予調整，誠如章君所云『工作效率是基於工作情緒而服務精神是寓於服務興趣的』意旨相同。本組同時爲提高行車人員質素，設訓導課，利用公休日輪流集訓，注意紀律品行學識，改變習性，以期增進工作效能爲市民服務。嗣後如再有車輛過站不停或待客無禮貌之處，請投函六六六號郵政信箱，本組當竭誠接受，盡力改善也。」特予刊登，用彰交通組之服務精神。</p>
<h3>代郵</h3>
<p>覆倪愼耆君：來函指陳請領身份證事，頃得上海市第十區區公所函稱：「査本區邇以奉令辦理戶籍登記過錄事宜，規定各保幹事均集中區所謄寫册籍，僅每日下午四時返保辦公一小時，倪君每至保處，恐正値過錄時間，且請領身份證，按戶籍法規定，須居住達一月後方可發給，故照章亦須査對居住年月以符手續。倪君之身份證收據已編到靜字第六一〇五一號，曾於本月廿二日派員送達在案，絕無如倪君來函所述推託並所謂弦外之音事實，茲倪君以急欲領證不耐等候時日而生誤會，深以爲憾。除飭令該保幹事並通飭各保嗣後對請領國民身份證，儘量簡化手續力求迅速外特將經過情形奉復」。特達，</p>
<p>覆張國寳君：來函對火南門火警目擊一則，頃得上海市警察局復稱：「經派員在出事地點調査，據居住大南門中華路同蘭里二號被災者林金生等稱：十一日下午七時　因居住同里二號業賽璐瑯之張德孚不慎起火，除二號全幢被燬外，鄰居之二號三號亦被災及，當起火時消防處即驅車灌救，蓬萊分局亦派警到達火塲，實施警戒，當時情形，頗爲良好，未聞有被災者從火塲跑出，與手中手箱被人刦去而反遭義務　察毆打及失竊手箱情事」。特復。</p>

<h3>顧維鈞綜合各方意見　裁軍案提具體辦法　蘇聯最長草案包含四要點</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約成功湖三十日電〕聯大政治及安全委會本日　續開會，討論裁減軍備問題，由中國代表團長顧維鈞博士發表演說，綜合蘇聯之建議，以及加澳兩國之修正案，提出計　四點如下：</p>
<p>（一）依照聯合國憲章第四十三條之規定，組織國際軍隊。（二）原子能委會雖應依照現行之規則程序繼續工作，但須禁止所有原子武器，以及其他大規模破壞之武器。（三）依照加澳兩國修正案所揭　之原則，設立國際管制與監察制度。（四）所有國家均應以援助界予安理會及原子能委會，俾使其工作得以便利進行。</p>
<p>顧大使之言有日，中國認爲蘇聯所提出之裁减軍備計劃，與加澳兩國所提出之修正案，均能互相補其不足，並不互相抵觸。加澳蘇三國之計劃，均爲一種願望所鼓動，質言之，即促進和平。安全。曁人類幸福之願望是也。任何裁減軍備之計劃，務必使其普遍有效，且能爲各國所接受，凡屬違反此項原則之任何計劃，均不可採取。加澳蘇三國所提出之建議，經本人加以　密研究後，認爲蘇聯之計劃實最爲簡單，甚至過於簡單，故實有加以若干修正之必要。加拿大所提出之修正案，頗爲有用，對於蘇聯之計劃，足以構成一種具體之貢獻，此在澳洲之修正案亦復相同。要而言之，中國對於上述三項計劃，均將予以支持。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖三十日電〕蘇聯代表團今晚綜合各方對裁軍問題之一切建議，向政治安全委會提出最後草案，其要點如下；</p>
<p>（一）聯大承認普遍裁減軍備之必要，以鞏固和平及增强國際安全。（二）原子能之製造凡用於軍事自標者必須禁止。關於此層，必須設立管制機關，以實施安理會對於該方面之決議。（三）大會承認全體會員國應就其兵力及國內軍器總數，預備報吿，而於安理會討論有關普遍裁軍之提議時，向該會提出之。（四）大會應籲請全體政府，盡其全力，援助聯大履行其責任，以謀樹立永久和平與保持世界安全。此項工作爲全世界人民所關切，因裁軍可以減輕渦度軍備費用之重負，此項軍備固非戰後所需也。</p>
<h3>美新計劃　內容兼收並蓄</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖三十日電〕政治委會繼續討論蘇聯裁軍計劃蘇澳洲與加拿大之修正案時，美國今日又有新計劃，內容係將以上每一計劃之要點，兼收並蓄。新方案殆將在明日會議席上中美代表康納利提出，其要點凡四：首三點須由聯大會向安理會提出，第四點聯大自動執行，計（一）安理會應立即草擬經由國際協定進行普遍裁軍之實施辦法；（二）安理會首先考慮原子能委會之報吿書；（三）安理會考慮保護軍備之管制；（四）聯大會要求全體會員國協助安理會及原子能委員會履行其任務。計劃中並未涉及否決權，美代表團事實上聲明否決權之利用，或將使裁軍之努力失效。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖三十日電〕美蘇今日一致主張聯合國機構對於世界普遍裁軍計劃，應首先討論原子能問題，惟於應用吾決權之原則，兩國意見仍相去至遠。中法英三國與美國聯合，反對原子能問題可應用否決權，蘇聯則堅主在安理會內對於一切問題均應保留否決權。</p>
<h3>西薩摩亞僑民平等　我提案竟遭否决　修改託管協定辯論無結果</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約三十日專電〕聯大託管小組委會，已否決我代表之建議，即保證聯今國一切會員國之國民在西薩摩亞羣島之入境旅行居住等，應受平等待遇。該委會於審査紐西蘭所提關於西薩摩亞羣島託管協議之十六條條文以後，即開始考慮其他代表團對上述協議條文之補充建議。第一項建議，即我代表所提關於平等待遇者，結果以七票對一票被否決，大部份代表棄權，投反對票者爲澳洲·加拿大·法國·荷蘭·紐西蘭·南非等。上述建議之關於託管協議之修文中，並主張聯合國憲章巾關於託管委會權利之規定中，應特別指明得接受請求對託管區域作定期性之視察。又我代表另一修正之建議，亦被該委會否決，即主張西薩摩亞羣島託管區域中之一切爭執，應由託管委會處理，不受國際法院管轄。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約三十日專電〕各委治國已在要求有權在各託管地維持軍事基地，而無須諮詢安理會一事上獲得勝利。今日彼等又聯合反對蘇聯之建議，蘇方建議確定期限硏究託管協定。在修改此項協定，各委治國　反對聯合國成立任何有　修改託管協定之强迫性建議。我國代表劉鍇則支特蘇聯之建議，南斯拉夫·印度。伊拉克·亦支特蘇聯之建議，然各委治國俱表反對，故辯論並無結果。</p>
<h3>印度南非爭執　將開直接談判</h3>

<p>應賦予傅達意志機會</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖三十日電〕聯大菲律賓首席代表羅末洛，今日提出新計劃，要求賦予非自治人民以發表意見之合法機關，英國予以支持，但法代表則在手續上表示反對。先是菲代表向大會提議，由經濟社會理事會召集非自治領土之國際會議，但英國表示反對，認爲此項行動將使聯合國處於其活動範圍以外。羅末洛乃於今日向聯大司法委會提出新建議，要求聯大會促請管理非自治土地之各國，召集附庸人民之區域會議，賦予非自治民族以表明其傳統與意志之機會。英代表伍特稱，此項新計劃，在法理上並無反對理由，本會不妨一致通過，提交託管委會云。</p>

<h3>鮑萊所提賠償計劃　日人方面認爲有利　謂我國內不安難與競爭</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京卅日電〕美國賠償專員鮑萊提出之日本賠償計劃，頃由日本有地位人士加以評論，僉謂計劃書中雖使日本喪失其鋼鐵及機械工具四分之三，大事削減其商船，並完全禁止其戰時工業，但日本對遠束貿易之潛力幾乎保持不動，此點出乎意料之外。日本之前途繫於遠東貿易，日本之剩餘工業，不僅保證其人民適常的生活標準，且可以製成品供給亞洲其他無力購買美貨之各國。日本將特別保持其紡織工業，並將繼續向整個任遠東輸出棉貨。賠償計劃中正確規定日太商船之噸位，（共一百五十萬噸，其中廿五萬噸專供對中菲貿易之用。）以便日本進行其遠東貿易。另一方面，日人確信　國人將以落伍不堪用之設備留與日本。日人對賠給中菲　國之工業設備，亦不以爲憾。其理由有二：（一）彼等認爲中國即使利用日本設備，亦難與日本競爭，因中國國內局勞缺乏安定，不利投資；（二）日本之設備早嫌陳舊，且經戰時過度應用，幾已損蝕，自樂於出讓，而希望自美國　入新設備。事實上，日本工業界對於賠償問題之遲遲不能解決，幾已不耐；彼等認爲賠償對日本不過略施小小手術，手術之成功，將確保日本經濟未來之復興云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山三十日電〕舊金山紀事報今日著論擁護賠償專員鮑萊之建議，限制日本鋼鐵工業，並主張同時應採取行動，發展中國（包括東九省）之鋼鐵業。據稱：聯合國應破壞日人控制下之鋼鐵及機器生產，毫無疑問，此爲根絕日本侵略能力，保障中國不致續受威脅之必要步驟。且聯合國不僅應根絕其侵略能力，亦不應以限制其生產量爲已足，必須有人負起責任，建立中國大陸之鋼鐵工業，使其能爲中國工業化從事生產。欲實現此舉，必須供給技術專家，機器設備與經濟援助，使中國（包括東九省）鋼鐵業具有更大之生產能力。如無此種積極辦法以完成其計劃，則鮑萊所擬之方案，適足以造成一危險之工業眞空地帶而已。</p>
<h3>日政府將設賠償協力會</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京一日電〕日本商工省因盟國賠償委員會美代表鮑萊·已向美政府建議，迅速實行拆去日本充作賠償之鋼鐵工廠及機械製造設施。爲適應此種建議，擬組織一「賠償設施撤去協力會」，由此協力會命令各地組織該業分會，俾爲協助盟國實行撤去之機關。又日政府爲謀辦理撤去事務便利起見，將於東京·愛知。神奈川·大阪·京都·兵庫·福岡·羣馬等都府縣政府內，設置賠償科，辦理賠償事務。日政府辦理，擬指定「賠償撤去法」特別法，於本月下旬提出通常議會。</p>

<h3>日本應如何賠償？　鮑萊計劃書公布　按照賠償清單戰國分而享之</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿九日合衆、電〕根據此間本日公布之盟國賠償委員會美代表鮑萊之建議，對日戰爭中勝利之國家，將獲得多數船隻，機車，鋼廠，其他重工業。鮑萊向杜魯門所提出之賠償建議書中，下列淸單谷物，由勝利國家共分，船隻一百十四艘，計三六一一千噸，造船廠三十至四十所，包括巨型乾船塢三處，機車九七〇輛，貨車三萬輛，每年可用以製造機車二二〇輛客車八百輛及貨車四八〇〇輛之設備，及機械工具約六十萬部。日本賠償淸單中，並包括煉鋼爐若干座，每年可煉鋼一千萬噸，輾鐵廠若干所，每年可輾鐵六百萬噸，可發二百瓩萬之熱電廠及水電廠，此等賠償品可供給要求分得日本賠償品之　蘇及其他遠東國家。以偉大之工眾力量美國擬提出極大要求，而以其所得轉交與其他國家，以助其復與工作。刻尙未決定一國家將分得若干。</p>
<p>何時開始分配</p>
<p>擬召開賠償會議以解決此等問題之計劃，已因蘇聯之拒絕以其自東北運走之設備作爲賠償品之一部份，而陷於停滯。鮑萊建議說减日本之鋼鐵工業，以結束諸亞洲國家之以日本爲煤鐵鋼之來源。鮑氏稱，此種形勢必須倒轉，而使日本仰賴亞洲供給生鐵塊，如是將阻礙日本恢復作戰能力。飽氏並建議：（一）將日本之鋼珠球及滾軸軸承製造設備全部運走，以防其製造武器；（二）限制日本用於商航之船隻，每艘不得超過五千噸，其航行路綫限於日本附近島嶼，朝鮮，及中國之間；（三）鮑氏復敦促採取行動，完全限制日本製造或出售各種波長之無綫電收音機，以防止日本政府檢査海外短波廣播之任何企圖；（四）沒收鋼鐵工廠作爲賠償品，屬於目本廿個最大財閥之工廠應首先沒收，因此等工廠之設備，在軍事組織之效果方面，倍於其他工廠。今日報紙披露之鮑萊</p>
<p>賠償計劃報告</p>
<p>，表示渠向杜魯門建議將日本之工業拆除，至僅足供其國內需要之程度。渠預言日本一九四六年之貿易，將减少至一億二千四百萬日元，一九四八年將僅爲三千九百萬日元，惟於一九四八年以前，或可能有貿易盈餘一億二千三百萬日元。鮑萊强調稱，「麥克阿瑟之政績卓越，惟猶需明確之賠償政策，始克將日本之戰時工業導入平時狀態」。</p>
<p>茲簡述鮑萊之計劃書如下：運輸方面，日商輸之噸數應减至可應付需要之最小數量，總噸數爲一百五十萬噸，鋼　船隻每隻噸數不得超過五千噸，最高速度爲十二海里，其分配法爲日本本島貿易需一二五萬噸，對朝鮮大連台灣中國之貿易需十二萬五千噸，可作爲賠償用者爲五千噸或噸數更大之船一一四艘，及船塢三十或四十處，</p>
<p>日尚保留船塢</p>
<p>大者十處，小者十二處。紡織方面日本尙有二百十萬八千枚紡錘，十三萬三千架織機，惟爲維持其本身之經濟，尙需要三百萬個紡錘，十五萬紡織機其棉製品，用以償付入口之棉花，絲應免列爲賠償物，但不應以種糧食之土地充爲種植桑樹之用。漁業方面，由於日本需要食物，漁業免爲賠償物資，惟應防止日本獨佔及掠取其隣國如朝鮮中國一帶海內之魚。關於機械工具，鮑萊之計劃稱，工具問題爲降低日本作戰潛力中心問題，淸單當减小至十七萬五千餘單位，其生產新機械工具之潛力，每年不逾一千部，共計有六十萬單位，當予拆移。一切有助與軍火生產之項目，俱將拆移。</p>
<p>關於鋼鐵部門</p>
<p>鮑萊之計劃稱：日本之鼓風爐生產量，每年當限於五十萬噸，生鐵鋼塊產量每年限於二百廿五萬噸，此適與英方主張任日本有更多之鋼產量相反。鮑氏此項計劃，將强迫日本每年必須輸入生鐵一百萬噸，從而使其不得不依賴於以前受奴役之各國，日本可保持鍊鋼量每年一百五十萬噸，其他一切設備俱應移爲賠償之用。關於鐵道，日本每年之機車生產量，當限於二十二輛，客車限於八百輛，貨車限於四千八百輛。供賠償之用者，則有汽船九百艘，電氣機車七十輛，貨車三萬輛及每年可生產機車八百五十輛之工廠。關於化學品方面，此種基本軍需工業·應限於製造爲國內糧食現生產所必需之肥料，俾日本不再依賴自太平洋各區輸入磷酸肥料，其每年產量超過一萬零二百五十噸之硝酸生產設備，應即移去，俾有每年可以生產二四萬噸硝酸之裝備，作爲賠償用，日本應保留三十萬噸之硝酸生產能力，各工廠應將四十五萬噸至五十萬噸之生產設備，作爲賠償之用·一切柏油蒸溜工廠及製造假象牙之工廠均應如所有之</p>

<h3>法政局仍動盪中　三大政黨各有千秋　戴高樂將軍可能東山再起</h3>
<p>〔　國新聞社巴黎三十日電〕法國社會黨與共黨代表，頃在此間舉行會議，互相交換對於參加未來政府所當採取之計劃，會議結果詳情未悉。但據兩黨發表公報稱。「本日會議時，社會黨代表詢問共黨在未來政府中，究欲保持多少席數，俾實施其施政計劃，並請共黨吿以該黨施政計劃所規定之重要措施，以及其行政方法。共黨代表當即逐一予以答覆，並提出總統與國民大會議長曁法蘭西共和國參院議長密切聯絡之一項問題。最後決定，本日所舉行會議互相交換之情報，將由兩黨代表轉吿各該黨。」</p>
<p>據政治觀察家談稱，觀於此公報，可知共黨曾企圖勸吿社會黨放棄其要求國民大會議長應由前財長奧利沃担任，但社會黨國民大會代表對此，甚爲冷淡，並認爲此事唯有社會黨全國執委會始能加以決定。十二月三日該會開會，當能決定國民大會議長之人選，加以激進社會黨內頗多政界　宿，至今未表明其主張。共黨在國民大會六百十八位議席中，佔有一百八十二席，即使獲得社會黨議席一百另一席之支撑，尙一需要激進社會黨議席四十三席之合作，始能保持絕對多數。此在人民共和黨在國民大會佔有議席一百七十二席，再加以上若干無黨派之議席，尙未放棄其對於總統之要求，一俟獲得有利機會，即將提出皮杜爾爲總統候選人。此外，人民共和黨亦有人主張在過渡時期，暫由財長許曼組織臨時政府，專心致力於金融復興及限制公共費用，政界對於此項計劃甚爲重視，咸皆認爲此種方式，在總統於明年一月中旬選出以前，足使政府採取有益之行動。</p>

<h3>美煤礦工潮巨浪所至　生產工業損失重大　遠在德國魯爾礦工亦起反應</h3>

<h3>暴徒昨仍繼續乘機滋事　當局具制暴戡亂決心　再有越軌行爲定予嚴厲處置　各路商店今日一律恢復營業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前日黄浦分局因處理攤販，發生紛擾，旁午將被拘押之攤販釋放後，本已無事，乃下午起因羣衆中有不逞之徒，乘機滋事，糾紛遂致擴大，昨日餘波未息，以致各路商店大都停業，惟至下午五時，情形漸見安定，市長昨晚特向市民廣播（見第二版）各商店經當局勸告後，今晟決一律照常營業，治安當可確保無慮。又據警局發表：該局業巳呈准市府，以後各區攤販種類，不予限制；黃浦老閘兩區如有公私空地，准其集中營業。</p>
<p>自晨至暮繼續擾亂情形</p>
<p>昨日清晟，情形尙稱安穩，交通亦見正常，僅黃浦分局門前已有少數行人冒雨竚立。惟自七時起，暴徒結成小隊，多者二三百人，少者數十人，至各菜塲阻止營業，繼即散往全市各地，强迫商店休業，各商店頗多因閉歇稍遟而被搗毁者。</p>
<p>至九睁左右，麕集於黄浦分局前之羣衆，愈聚愈多。時適老北門大新鮮果行因適定昨日新張，然放鞭砲，羣衆疑爲槍聲，秩序大亂，警察亦即採取緊急措施，千餘羣衆奔逃之際，又有不良分子捣毁民國路，晏海路，福佑路一帶商店四十餘家，南市商店，乃全部休業。同時福煦路亦發現暴徒二三百人，結隊滋擾。慕爾鳴路有暴徒企圖奪取警士手槍，致傷行人二名。</p>
<p>九時三十分起，暴徒又儘量阻止交通，捣毁並刦持各種交通工具。同孚路福煦路口，有三路公共汽車一辆，被暴徒衝入車厢，將乘客驅逐下車，并將玻窗擊毁。同時虹口區有暴徒一批，在賓山路一帶向北火車站捣亂。</p>

<p>三時另五分，福建路電話公司又集暴徒百餘人，手持國旗，搗毁電車。</p>
<p>至四時十五分起，黄浦分局情形又突轉惡，暴徒將前日已經摀毁之高生大紙號内傢具排門，拖至馬路，縱火燃燒，並阻止消防組施救。羣衆聚集千餘，警士乃又開槍，流彈傷便衣警士一人，暴徒二人受傷。是時警備司令部特務連有装甲車三輛開到，加强警衛力量，大隊憲兵及騎巡隊亦已到達，河南路附近之羣衆皆被驅散，而福建南路高生大前，仍麕聚羣衆千餘人，交通阻塞。</p>
<p>五時半，羣衆中曾推出代表魏伯顺，沈石奇，陸松富等三人，向黄浦分局交涉，謂有攤販四人尙被拘押，請予釋放，經杜分局長接見後，即任彼等至拘留所內察閱，則已並無攤販拘留。三代表向衆說明後，羣衆即散，時則天色亦已漸暝矣。</p>

<h3>徐寄廎·杜月笙　勸告各業商店　一律恢復常態攤販生計已妥謀解決中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會理事長徐寄廎，昨晚九時對本報記者稱：昨晚六七時，秩序大有進步，商店開門營業者已多，目前當局巳採有效處置，相信本日一切可無問題。至於攤販生計，政府決爲設法解決，黄浦老閘兩區之取締，主因爲該兩地人口太稠密，且爲交通要道之故，至於僻遠之區，固無意取締至於商店在混亂中之損失補償，一時尙難談到。又此次騷擾搗亂，已非攤販問題，顯然另有背景。商界同人，在此塲合，必须明辨愼思，出於鎭定，勿受煽惑。昨日上午南京路福建路若干店舖，有未關門營榮者，當係未盡明瞭眞相之故，希望經此勸告，能即恢復常態，共維秩序。至於地方治安，自有市政當局負責，商人不必爲危言所惑云云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕根據曆本，昨天是「大好日」，又是星期天，所以選擇這一天，舉行訂婚結婚的人很多。全市雖籠罩在無限淒涼的氣氛下，一對對新人們的好事，却沒有受到絲毫影響。記者昨日下午，曾驅車赴康榮·國際·晋隆·萬旬廳·東亞又一樓·新生活俱樂问题等處，祇見禮堂上都高懸囍字，賀客不絕。和交通斷絕，崗衝森嚴，商店打烊的街這上對比起來，這裏是一個截然不同的世界。他們和她們都是有福的！</p>
<h3>市參議會昨晚發表　處理攤販案經過　攤販問題已獲圓滿解決　提出意見三點迅辦善後</h3>
<p>上海市參議會對攤販問題，發表處理經過及意見如下：查市政府警察局，茲爲便利交通，整飭市容起見，禁止黄浦老閘兩區攤販設攤營業，經該兩區警察分局嚴厲執行，拘押攤販多人，十一月三十日上午，有攤販代表周以忠，劉華山，包桂枝，鄭芝章等廿八人，齊集本會呼籲，當由該代表等提出口頭請求兩點：（一）立即開釋被拘攤販，以免凍餒之虞。（二）禁令從緩實施，或另覓營業地點，而維生計。當經本會項秘書長昌欋代表接見，並即據情以電話與吳市長接洽，經吳市長答復，被拘攤販可即令飭該兩分局開釋，在黃浦老閘二區另覓地點開業一節，允予考慮。該代表等聆悉之後，認爲滿意，並要求本會顧念彼等生計，繼續再與市府磋商後退出。下午三時，（十一月三十日）本會召開各委員會召集人會議討論例案時，唐參議員世昌等，因外傅黃浦分局拘押攤販禁止遞送食物衣服，不免凍餒，及攤販家屬被毆情事，認爲事態嚴重，提出臨時動議，經决議推派唐參議員世昌，朱參議員文德，王參議員先靑三人前往調查眞相，以憑辦理，旋於四葉許，又有攤販代表十餘人，陪同被拘攤販季錫恩之家屬，季振年來會聲明，該季振年因送飯被毆受傷，告以已經派有參議員前往調查，該販等聞訊即退。先是在十一月十四日，本會接獲黃浦老閘兩區攤販請願書一件，即經根據本會第一次大會金字第三號決議（辦法第二點，在不妨碍市容及不妨碍交通之原則节，重行劃定攤販區域）兩請警察查明辦理見復在案，適於是時(　三十日下午五時）復文亦到略以：「本局爲顧念攤販生計起見，茲巳呈准市府，略予通融，准許各攤販在該兩區內自擇公私空地集中營業，並已分令各該管分局知照矣」云云。本會認爲警局此項答復，已容納攤販要求，隨即於當晚將來函轉達該攤販代表等在案。至於三十日下午所發生之聚衆包圍黃浦分局，希圖擾亂治安，及晚間糾衆搗毁汽車及商店等情事，頃（十二月一日正午十二時）據該代表周以忠，鄭芝章，任劍生，陳桐錢等來會聲稱：絕無攤販參加其間，並稱：警局昨日復文處置辦法，已經满意接受，是則攤販問題，實已解決，至於卅日聚眾包圍警察分局，及沿途搗毁汽車商店，及一日上午繼續脅迫商店關門等情事，當局另有不軌份子，藉端圖謀擾亂治丧，顯非攤販所爲，本會議長及唐朱王三參議員，曾先後親赴出事地點調查，並力請市政當局及淞滬　　司令部等，着爲處理，本會以爲此事善後，應即分別辦理下列各點：</p>

<p>（二）黄浦分局如確有禁阻攤販家屬遞送食物衣服及無端兇毆等情事，顯遵人道，應由上級主管迅即查明，依法處理，以示政府重視人民應享合法權利之至意</p>

<h3>冬防聲中話警政</h3>
<p>— 本報特稿</p>
<p>上海自開埠以後，在國際資本經營之下，表面上成爲繁華都會，顯示其優越地位。但五方　處的居民，良莠不齊，所以從大都市的側面來看，實爲罪惡淵　，舉凡欺騙掠奪，誨浮販毒，殺人越貨的行爲，應有盡有。尤其在過去租界期內，許多作奸犯科之人，往往在洋人卵翼之下，以租界爲護身符，而橫行無忌。</p>
<p>勝利後一年中所發生的刑事案件，據警察常局報吿，共一九·九六三件，平均每日占五百四十七件，這是何等驚人的數目，維持上海治安是不容易的工作。同時物質文明愈發達，機詐欺騙之前事也愈多，而精密的計劃，敏疾的行動，使負責治安常局的，更感到困難，於是不得不採用更新的防制技術和機構，如無綫電警備車之類，先後在上海出現。上海警政，乃順着這條歷史的路徑而進展。</p>
<p>夭已漸漸地冷了，在　風的西北風中，貧民更耐不住飢察的侵襲，犯罪行爲，要較天暖的時候爲多。他們利用陰寒之夜，大多數市民正躲在他們溫暖的被窩中，蕭蕭的風聲，掩沒了他們行動的聲患，用偸竊掠奪的手段來燦決這飢寒問題。一年一度的冬防，乃應時而起。今年的冬防已經開始了，在嚴寒風雪之夜，警士們將更加重了他們的工作。</p>
<h3>上海市警察局沿革</h3>
<p>上海市警察局初稱上海特別市公安局，在民國十六年七月二十二日，由前淞滬警察應改組成立，十九年七月一日，奉令按照市組織法規定，更名上海市公安局，一一十六年一月一日，奉令改稱上海市警察局，經遇沿革，可以分爲四個階段說明：</p>
<h3>巡防保甲局</h3>
<p>上海縣昔設縣尉，巡檢等職，負責巡捕盜賊，治理奸宄事宜。這種職官名稱，淸初仍沿用，不過員額有限，談不上行政效率。直到太平天國車興以後，淸廷加意整頓地方行政，頒佈保甲章程，推行保甲制度，設置巡防保甲局，內設總巡一人，由上海道委員派充，掌理城廂內外巡防保甲事宜。總局初設城中沉香閣，後還縣署旁常平倉內，並在城東，南，西，北及城外北新涇，引翔港，虹口，浦東等處先後設置分局九處，局中人員，分別由駐防軍營撥充，俱歸總局管轄。當時該局總巡曾出吿示，略謂：「本總巡奉憲檄督辦城廂內外巡防保甲事務，向聞有等著名痞棍，以及拆梢，蟻媒，拐騙，剪綹，竊賊並外來流氓，三五成羣，聚於茶坊酒肆，其名曰吃講茶；糾黨串詐，橫行不法，貽害地方，幷在途中假稱碰撞，訛詐，搶帽，竊物，攫取婦女首飾，揑造謠言……尤有不肖之徒，聚衆開設賭塲，抽頭漁利，如牌九，擲羊，押寳，翻天印諸色名目，不一而足。……本總巡爲民除害起見，本當按名立拿重辦，姑念無知，不忍不教而誅。若能從此斂跡……則免其旣往；如果仍蹈前轍，……立即指名拿究。」由此可見該局管理事項，不過如此而已。</p>
<h3>馬路工程善後局與招捕章程</h3>
<p>巡防保甲局時期，軍警尙混淆未分，光緒二十四年，南市的馬路工程局改稱馬路工程善後局，値外馬路新近築成，關於彈壓巡，査事宜創辦「中國巡捕房處」置之，在浦灘一帶，酌定地段，分設三處。除由江蘇撫標滬軍營調派勇丁選充巡捕外，並定立招捕章程：「一，須身體强壯；一，年在三十歲左右；一，無論何省之人，皆須熟悉本地情形，並能操本地語言；一，須有妥當鋪戶擔保；一，不准吸食洋烟，嗜酒，好賭；一，到局考騐，須親身不准頂替；一，一人不准報兩名，達者並扣；一，臨時不到，着即於册內扣除，不准補考；一，本局僕役已經因事剔退者，不准充捕；一，另立捕勇章程，一律遵照，遠者懲辦。」後來選定巡捕六十名，上海道續又雇用印捕六名。吳淞籌劃開埠時，曾擬設巡捕房，但未實現。光緒三十年，閘北工程總局以商款不繼，呈請官辦，於光緒卅二年實現。</p>
<h3>縱警察學堂到巡警總局</h3>
<p>設局和招募巡捕，不過模仿租界章程，仍未確定警察行政制度。光緒三十年，淸政府增設巡警部，由上海道擬具辦法，詳准江督蘇撫，舉辦警察，委上海知縣爲總辦，駐營軍官一人爲會辦，聯合地方紳董五人佐理其事。先從訓練人材着手，將求志書院改爲警察學堂，聘貿日專攻警察學學生一人任敎習，挑選駐防營勇一百名入堂習業，同時招收學員。光緒三十一年起，開放站崗，撤銷巡防保甲局，改名警察總巡局。限於經費，規模至小，所訂章程，也很簡略。光緒三十三年，江督以「滬地治安，關係全局，必須全力貫注，方能自保主權」，致電上海道，推廣警政，並委候補道一人爲總辦，閘北工程總局，已改官辦上海北市馬路工巡總局，至此又改組爲上海巡警總局　，計劃警區爲四路二十區。次年，淸政府改設民政部，電令蘇省設巡警道，上海因設巡警這一人，在四路二十二區內，實行設警。後來巡警道改駐蘇州，上海巡警總局又改設局長。</p>
<h3>民國以後新面自</h3>
<p>上海光復後，閘北的巡警總局長潛逃無蹤，全市警務，由上海市政廳警務處長管轄。民國二年，袁政府頒佈「劃一現行地方警察官廳組織令」，淞滬警察廳成立，管轄區域，跨有上海，寳山兩縣。內部設機要，督察兩處，總務，行政·司法，衛生四科；外部設一至六區署，區以下設分所十九處，另設保安警察一隊，游巡警察四隊，水巡警察一隊，偵緝警察一隊，共三千餘人。民國十六年，上海特別市正式成立，設上海特別市公安局，主管滬市警政，十九年改稱上海市公安局，二十六年，更名上海市警察局，惟管轄範圍僅限市郊，勝利以後，收回兩租界，無權亦同時收回，上海市的警察行政遂吿統一。</p>
<h3>過去的「巡捕房」</h3>
<p>「到行裏去」已成爲上海的一句通常話，所謂「行」者，就是從前維持租界治安的巡捕房。警察乃近代的專門名詞，但兩租界却沿用這舊名詞「巡捕」，機關也稱謂巡捕房。</p>
<p>鳴警報更</p>
<p>當租界設立之初，僅雇用華人數名爲更夫，擔任鳴警報更等事，屬於領事管轄。至一八五四年，小刀會佔領上海縣城，居民紛紛還入租界，英美法三國共同成立了一個工部局，同時藉口事實上的需要，組織巡捕隊，聘香港巡捕房職員克列夫登來滬任總巡，此爲租界設巡捕房之始。</p>
<p>按第一次所訂立的地皮章程，我國官廳，以明文規定，租界內不准設立警務處。迨太平軍與，上海縣城，尙須乞援英法防護，租界一事，自然更無暇顧及。英美法三國領事乃擅自修改地皮章程，設立了警務處。</p>
<p>巡捕房是屬於工部局管轄的，遇有侵害領事職權之處，領事們便覺得不滿意。一八五五年，小刀會退出上海縣城，秩序漸漸恢復。領事們以爲工部局將軍火置於巡捕手中，頗覺危險。經英美法三國領事磋商後，結果聯名出一佈告，略謂現有巡捕官員業已停職，此後非經中外當局批準，不得執行職務。四個月後，英領阿利國與工部局始簽字允准，從此公共租界遂有常備巡捕。</p>
<p>最初警士僅有八人</p>
<p>最初租界警士僅有八人，由總巡統率，一八六〇年，太平軍攻上海，華人入租界者，驟增至三十萬人，租界警士，也遽增至二百名。一八六四年，太平軍失敗，避難華人大多還回，租界內華人戶口，降至七萬人左右，行政時頗感經濟困難，遂裁减警士爲一百六十四名。</p>
<p>租界內的警士，其初全由外人充任，招用華警，始於一八六五年。這一年中，公共租界計有外警六十一人，華警四十二人。一八八四年，開始雇用印籍警士。一九二六年，又雇用日籍警士三十名，分駐虹口一帶。租界面積，日益拓展，人口日見稠密，警士隨而增多，警衛的力量也加厚了。至一九三七年，公共租界警務處，計有外籍警士四百五十二人，日籍警士二百七十二人，華籍警士三千四百五十二人，印籍警士五百五十五人。</p>
<p>前法租界</p>
<p>至於佚租界方面，愛棠總領事首先反對巡捕制度，聲明不欲與聞公共租界工部局留用巡捕事件。但法租界自小刀會失敗以後，市况亦漸繁榮，一八五六年，地主大會開會時，有組織法租界巡捕房之提議，乃雇用外籍巡捕三名，日夜巡邏。至次年初，又因地主反對而取消，直至那一年十二月，才雇用巡捕十二名，正式成立巡捕房。</p>
<p>一八六二年，法租界脫離公共租界而獨立，成立了公董局，董事由法領事委任。從那時起，巡捕房也劃歸公董局管轄。公董局接管後，對於這　型巡捕房，積極整頓，委任駐滬法國退伍軍人能德爲總巡。此時捕顯巳增至四名，巡警二十名了。至一九〇六年，增用越捕，而華捕亦增爲一百五十餘人。至一九三五年，法租界警員，共達二千餘名。</p>
<p>警務處的行政長官爲警務總監，直接受命於法駐滬總領事，但警務處的經費和警員的薪餉，却由法租界公董局來負拒，這是與公共租界制度不同的地方。</p>
<p>勝利後，巡捕房亦隨租界而解散，過去服務於兩租界的外籍警員，大部均已解雇，上海警權，遂歸統一。</p>
<h3>租界時期的「包打聽」</h3>
<p>過去本市兩租界警務處，均設有便衣偵探，俗稱『包打聽」，若輩皆爲熟悉上海社會情形者，分門別類，各定範圍，大致分作「政治」，「烟賭」，「盜匪」，「花捐」等。</p>
<p>法租界的包打聽，除上述各項事務以外，尙有一項特殊的臨時工作，即爲保護過境居住的中國政府要人，必要時甚至長駐要人的家中，每日分班輪値，直待要人離滬，方才撤離。</p>
<p>這些一包打聽隨身携帶手槍，以便隨時執行職務，但因爲穿的是便服，所以往往更可以收「迅雷不及掩耳」的功效，過去曾發生路刦鼠竊向「包打聽」行刦勒索的趣事，結果是手到擒來，反而成了送上門來的階下之囚。</p>
<p>目前的市警察局仍然雇有便衣探員，不過「包打聽」這一個名稱却很少聽見提起了。尤其是初到上海的客籍人，假如你對他提出道一個名字，他們一定會茫然不知所謂的。</p>
<h3>上海的女警察</h3>
<p>都市中作奸犯科者頗多，他們爲了逃避警務人員的耳目，不惜用盡心計，甚至利用一般無識婦女，挾帶這禁物品，作種種男女分工合作的犯罪行爲。警士以男女有別，雖遇有形跡可疑者，仍不便直接執行職權，女警察便應運而生。</p>
<p>紐約爲女警的發源地，我國最先設置女警的城市，首推杭州，次爲北平，服務成績，均甚良好。</p>
<p>民國十八年春，上海市六區黨部曾向市政府提出設置女檢査員的意見，當由張市長岳軍飭令公安局長袁良招考，當時規定投考資格，須品學兼優，年在三十以上，及熟悉社會情形者，報名投考雖甚踴躍，但考試結果，正取僅二十名，審査履歷，俱係受過高等敎育者，且大半會任校畏，敎員，及公務員等職，錄取以後，延聘專家訓練，然後分發車站，輪埠服務，成續優良，歷年破獲拐婦綁匪，花會賭窟，毒品凶器，不計其數。但道些女檢査員執行工作時，多係便衣，有異於女警察。</p>
<p>上海市正式添設女警察，實始於民國二十五年，先是公安局長蔡勁軍氏，鑒於市內有添設女警的需要，特呈準市政府，在警士教練所內，創設女警訓練班，招收女警四十名，報名投考，共有二百七十四人，實到考試二百二十八人，出身以初中畢業居多，計一百五十四人；高小畢業者計七十四人，高中畢業者十二人，專科以上者七人。八月十二日揭曉，正取二十五人，備取五人。所缺名額十五名，於八月二十四日繼續招考。兩次考試結果，完全合格者共三十六名，於九月一日在龍華警士敎練所舉行開學典禮，女警制服，一律黑衣白袴黑帽，嚴肅整齊，經四個月訓練，於二十六年元旦日全體畢業。一月七日，正式分發各分局。襄助調査戶籍及担任女査緝員等職，工作勤奮，頗能勝任。</p>
<h3>竹布長衫瓜皮帽　華捕如此怪服裝</h3>
<p>華捕受法租界雇用之初，服裝特吳：秋夏兩季，頭戴瓜皮帽，帽頂釘一大紅綫結，身衣竹布長衫，而鞋被式樣則並無規定。冬季戴金嬝毡帽，穿灰色布棉袍，外罩西裝大衣，衣樣證。證章和號碼，手執「司的克」一柄，作爲防身之具。</p>
<p>不久，改爲天靑羽毛緞製號衣，形狀似馬褂而略長，左襟佩證章符號，以示一律，但袴，鞋，　仍可隨意穿着。除夏季戴紅纓藤帽外，餘時用紅纓大帽．其後，改帽上紅樓爲紅，白，藍三色。後來又取消難色袴，易爲號袴，與號衣相同，始稍類似警裝制服。</p>
<h3>萬國商團事略</h3>
<p>這一個防衛上海的特殊組織，其歷史差不多與租界一樣的長，在悠久歷程中，經過多决的改革隊伍頗稱現代化。過去上海屢遭戰禍，萬國商國確曾盡過很大的責任。</p>
<p>上海萬國商團，以一八五三年英僑所組織之「義勇隊」開端，時太平軍已下南京，克鎭江，上海外僑恐懼，武裝中立，組織義勇務爲當時第一件事。一八五五年，太平軍聲勢日蹙，義勇隊漸成有名無實。這一八六〇年，太平軍再度克杭州，迫蘇州，上海英僑義勇隊乃重新改組，以保護租界。</p>
<p>一八六二年又有輕騎隊之組織商團之存在，漸成爲永久性。一八七〇年七月二日，商團開會，決定受工部局管轄，成爲正式組織。此後屢經擴充改組，屬隊亦繼續增加，各屬隊中，有中途解散者，如海關隊是，但大都均維持至一九四二年解散時爲止。茲就各隊成立先後，列表於後：</p>
<p>「甲」隊　英一八五三年</p>
<p>「乙」隊　英一八五五年</p>
<p>上海輕騎隊　英一八六二年</p>
<p>上海重砲隊　英一八七〇年</p>
<p>日本隊　日一九〇〇年</p>
<p>美國隊　美一九〇六年</p>
<p>葡萄牙隊　葡一九〇六年</p>
<p>中華隊　中一九〇七年</p>
<p>上海工程隊　英一九〇七年</p>
<p>上海蘇格蘭隊　英一九一四年</p>
<p>美國騎兵隊　美一九二三年</p>
<p>俄國第一隊（常備）俄一九二七年</p>
<p>俄國第二隊（常備）俄一九二七年</p>
<p>俄國第四隊（常備）俄一九三二年</p>
<p>菲律賓隊　菲一九三二年</p>
<p>美國機關槍隊　美一九三二年</p>
<p>美國後備隊　美一九三二年</p>
<p>運輸隊　英·德一九三二年</p>

<p>譯員隊　中一九三二年</p>
<p>防空隊　一九三二年</p>
<p>猶太隊　猶一九三二年</p>
<h3>中華隊</h3>
<p>萬國商團中之中華隊，乃由華商體操會改組而成，上海自通商而後，成爲國際都市，但國人常受外人歧視。一九〇五年，因黎黃氏案而發生大鬧會審公廨事件，擾攘不可終日。乃由處洽卿胡寄梅袁恒之等發起，以商團維持地方治安，保護居民生命財產，籌款組織，初在華商體操會，旋改爲華隊公會，一時應召者五百餘人，分爲步兵四隊，騎兵一隊，軍樂一隊，闢北浙江路之空地爲操塲，購辦槍械，聘請敎練，儼然成軍矣。</p>
<p>華隊成立一年後，始終未與租界發生關係，會員人數，亦逐漸减少，乃由發起人議決要求加入萬國商團爲中華隊，經工部局同意，於一九〇七年三月十七日，在當時南京路的市政廳，簽約入團，爲萬國商國屬隊之一。</p>
<h3>五項條件</h3>
<p>中華國加入之初，工部局曾規定五項條件；（一）人數五十至一百。（二）隊員須體面商人，與政界不生關係，而體格健全者。（三）每人須有殷實鋪保。（四）隊長由西人充任。（五）槍械槍刺，不得帶回，用前領取，用後國庫。其時隊員委曲求全，始終保持純潔之結合，頗受中外人士熱烈之欽佩。尤以一九〇九年第一次參加射擊比賽時，獲「腦維司」獎杯，頗得讚許，漸與各國隊伍，平等待遇，浩成日後之盛况，</p>
<p>商團自成立後，組織日見擴大。初工部局與英國陸軍部訂立契的，借用該國陸軍常備軍官充任團長，迨歐戰發生，改由義勇軍官担任。商團之訓練，分整隊游行，射擊，行軍進行，動員練習，控制暴動，及野戰野營等等，現在虹口公園的靶子塲，即商團練習射擊的地方。靶子塲原設於靶子路北河南路附近，後因附近居民漸多，乃於一八九五年遷至虹口公園之旁。</p>
<p>一九四二年九月，前工部局議決將萬團商團裁撤，歷九十年的萬國商團，從此遂成爲上海歷史上之名稱。</p>
<h3>騎巡隊</h3>
<p>在過去租界時期，遇有盛大游行或軍隊開拔時，皆有幾個印捕騎着高頭大馬做前導，甚至富有之家的大出喪，也用他們開路。此即租界的騎巡隊，乃上海的一極特殊點綴品。</p>
<p>騎巡隊萌芽於一八六四年，至翌年綫正式成立，最初發軔於楊樹浦。其時麥克利克路尙爲荒野之地，並無人烟，亦無巡捕警衛。有所謂「九十六號燈」者，乃其地之唯一警燈，使遠來市民，夜間仍得安然返城。當局燃點此燈，保護區內安全。每逢夕陽西下，騎巡隊派二人前往守衛，至翌晨，始熄燈而返。當時認爲此項工作，含有冒險性質，故成立騎巡隊以處理之。</p>
<p>嗣後騎巡隊逐漸擴充，　及公共租界全境。自跑馬廳至靜安寺一段，爲騎巡隊巡邏之地，執行一項頗有趣的任務，即禁止路上馳馬，以及馬車疾馳‘，因當時滬人喜以馬車競逐，所謂「出風頭」是也。後來虹橋區域，居民增多，騎巡隊之職務，擴充至麥克利奧路。騎巡隊在上海警政中，担任一種特務，昔日越界築路區域，皆由其巡邏，以作安全保陣。惟自汽車流行後，騎巡隊己失去其價値，至一九四〇年九月，終因飼料困難而解散。</p>
<p>騎巡隊之人員，從未超過三十人，解散時，有外籍及印度警官各二人，印捕二十二人，大半會在印度陸軍中服務。組織頗類加拿大皇家西北騎巡隊，欲以少數人員獲較大效果，此二十六人之騎巡隊，已足爲當時公共租界全境之用。該隊有駿馬四十匹，大多爲本市養馬主人所贈，其中不乏稱雄於跑馬廳之名駒，迨騎巡隊解散，仍歸還原主云。</p>
<h3>從前的印捕·越捕和日捕</h3>
<p>過去上海的警察，除了華員和租界的西捕外，還有印捕越捕和日捕，這許多稱族不同的人，共同防衛這國際性的都市。</p>
<p>印捕在上海可說是一種特殊點綴品，一個個是彪形大漢，長着滿臉的鬍鬚，紅巾包頭，與棕黑色的皮膚，相映成趣。騎巡隊的印捕，騎在高大的馬背上，更覺得威風，無怪有人要以印捕來恐嚇那深夜啼哭的小孩子了。「阿三」成爲印捕的代名詞，但其出典如何，已不可知。</p>
<p>印捕</p>
<p>在什麼時候上海纔有印捕呢？一八六〇年，太平軍攻打上海縣城時，曾有一度爲印度兵擊退的話，可知那時印度兵已到上海。但公共租界正式雇用印捕，還在二十四年之後。從工部局的人口調査來看，一八八〇年，印人祇有四名，到一八八五年驟增至五十八名，這是與印捕問題有關的。</p>
<p>一八八三年，工部局整頓巡捕的紀錄中，有擬用印捕六十五人之計劃，接着又有規定招用印捕的新章，租界之有印捕，即在那時發動。一八八四年，工部局會計報吿中關於巡捕一項，開支增加了人萬多兩，也可斷定是因雇用印捕所致。那一年，正値中法戰事發生，工部局認爲有設警保護界外外僑之必要，於是在靜安寺路及鄰近各馬路上，除原有管理交通的華捕外，又加派印捕。此見於工部局年報，乃正式官報中所提到印捕的最早紀錄。若算至太平洋戰事發生時止，則印捕在上海，共有五十餘年的歷史。</p>
<p>法捕</p>
<p>法租界巡捕房雇用安南人爲巡捕，始於一九〇〇年。那時正値拳能作亂，平津一帶，外僑先後被殺，上海人心惶惑，尤以外僑爲甚，於是紛紛調集兵艦，進泊浦江，聲稱保護租界。</p>
<p>法租界成立了一個防務委員會，作緊急措施的準備。同時公警局董事會覺得在排外在潮之下，租界上雇用許多華捕，未免不妥，爲實現以「黃」制「黃」的政策，乃有雇用越捕之決定。當時法領事白藻泰商請越南總督杜美調派東京民個來滬。七月中，越督所派越捕廿九名到滬，此爲越捕在上海出現之始。</p>
<p>至一九〇一年三月，戰事結束，和平條約已經簽訂，此二十九名戰時性質的越捕，也由公實局遺回安南。一九〇六年，法公董局董事會又決定招雇越捕，此即戰前我們在法租界所見到的，上海正式雇用越捕，始於是時。</p>
<p>日捕</p>
<p>日捕的性質，與雇用的印捕越捕不同，是由在滬日僑的請求，專爲保護他們的安全而設的。</p>
<p>在一九一四年間，工部局已有日本警官三人，從事翻譯，處理中日人民間所發生之爭執。至一九一六年，日領事有吉明及工部局日董藤村義朗的工部局建議，增設日捕，經採納施行。警務處乃在東京延聘警官三人，巡捕廿七人來滬，是年十一月成立日太巡捕隊，分派在北四川路一帶，開始服務。</p>
<p>日捕隨日僑增多而漸漸擴充，至一九二六年日籍警員已增爲九十六人，一九二七年增爲二百五十六人，抗戰發生後，日警權力更大，在虹一帶，利用其特殊勢力，造成許多慘案。</p>

<h3>國貨供應有餘　呢絨應限制進口　外貨傾銷生產無從發展　今年實銷祗百五十萬碼</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市毛絨紡織整染工業同業公會，以最近外貨瘋狂傾銷，國產呢絨則瀕絕境。値茲修正進出口貿易暫行辦法頒行伊始，特臚陳該業目前產銷實况，及國產呢絨足以供應全國耗用而有餘之事實，呈請輸入臨時管委會執委會嚴格限制毛製品進口，以救工業，而培國本。茲摘錄呈文要點如次：</p>
<p>現在之生產力</p>
<p>（一）查本會所屬各賓員廠，大小共計五十九家。其設備據本年二月間調査：粗紡的有一萬八千錠‘精紡約有九千七百錠，織機的有一千零五十台（二月以後添置者不在內）。迨本年十月，本會因新增貨物稅事，對於各會員生產數量，曾爲詳情之調査，其統計數字如下：</p>
<p>（甲）八，九，十，三個月旺市之生產量：</p>
<p>一，織機開日工者，約五百台（不及總數之半）</p>
<p>二，織機開日夜工者，約二百台（不及總數五分之一）。</p>
<p>每台每班粗細統扯織十一碼，計每月（二十六天），生產二十五萬碼左右。八，九，十，三個月總生產量，的七十五萬碼。</p>
<p>（乙）一月至七月（淡月），因復員未及，原料未來，開工者不及十之一二，故七個月總生產量，的二十萬碼。</p>
<p>（丙）各廠實銷額，祗及生產額十分之六。（因外貨瘋狂傾銷，無孔不人，而購買力又薄弱之故）。</p>
<p>外貨傾銷數字</p>
<p>依上統計，本年度國產呢絨銷售總額，在五十萬碼以下，不足全部生產量十分之二。反觀外貨呢絨，在十個月中，陸續運到者，的在一百萬碼以上。其已定而將到者，亦在一百萬碼左右（根據海關及呢絨業調査報吿）。其中又以粗紡Woollen之墨爾登呢，及女式呢佔絕大多數。基上事實，國產呢絨之銷售，尙不及外貨之半數。</p>
<p>國貨品質優良</p>
<p>（二就呢絨絨綫品質而論，本會各同業，積二十餘年之經騐，深信在技術方面，年有進一步。如果原斜相同，出品儘能娩美外貨。試査附呈國貨及舶來品各種樣子，國產品質，已超越舶來品。而各種機械設備，應有儘有。徒以勝利以來，外貨瘋在傾銷。而進口商人，昧於情勢，各自爲政。羣以呢絨進口，爲暴利之源。盲目狂進，以致供過於求，兩敗俱傷。（此中以大批猶太商之私貨爲尤甚）。</p>
<p>國產已覺過剩</p>
<p>（三）以生產與實銷論：</p>
<p>（甲）紡工業最低生產量：</p>
<p>一，呢絨：試以本年「一月份調査所得一千零五十台織機而論（以後添置者不計在內），每台每班扯十一碼，則日夜開工，每月生產遠六十萬碼。上海一處，每年至少可生產七百萬碼。而國營中紡各廠產量，可抵全部民營。再加華北西南各廠，則全國總產量，常在二千萬碼左右。</p>
<p>二，絨綫：本會各絨綫廠，每月的可生產三十萬磅。而外商蜜蜂怡和二廠，亦可月產三十萬磅。僅上海一處，可生產七百萬磅左右。</p>
<p>（乙）本年度呢絨綫實銷數：</p>
<p>呢絨絨綫實銷限於都市，並未普及農村。比來民生凋敝，購買力薄弱，加以縫工奇高，銷路益難依據。上開統計，本年度國產呢絨祗銷五十萬碼，外貨銷售百餘萬碼，是全部實銷不過一百五十萬碼，不及全部生產量十分之一，已覺供過於求。所以在上月份呢絨絨綫正在當令旺銷時期，價格竟降落十分之三。各廠些微生產積存未銷者，已達十分之四。是外貨呢絨絨綫，根本無進口之必要，徒在摧殘本業衰弱之基礎。</p>
<p>生產減退原因</p>
<p>（四）更有進者，近來國貨售俾，所以不能與外貨競爭者，全在成本之不能减低。而成本不能减低之最大原因，在生產不能開足。譬如某廠有織機五十台，現在只開日班十台，每日只能生產一百十碼。如果五十台日開足，則每日可出一千一百碼。其生產量爲一與十之比。以十碼之生產設備造一碼之呢絨浪費人力財力莫過於此，以致造成外貨傾銷機會，坐使國貨工廠深陷泥淖而不能自拔。言念及此，實爲工業前途憂。惟已往不鑒，來者可追。嗣後務懇鈞會，權衡利害，迅將附表（三）一一九，一二二外貨呢絨絨錢。禁止進口，則我國貨呢絨，因生產多而成本輕，而售價賤，從而廠與廠競爭，不但技術上定有長足進步，即營業方面，亦可互相發展，因而奠定本業堅强之基礎。彼時即有舶來品競爭，亦可有備無患。且國貨呢絨，不特可以普銷國內，挽回利權，更可推銷南洋以及其他各處，爲國家爭取外匯，發揚光大，指日可期。</p>
<h3>商店停業　今日一律開市</h3>
<p>昨爲星期日。銀錢業及各大商業照例休息，其門售商店，因攤販風潮未平，有數處被威逼停業，各商店爲安全計，自動打烊者甚多，街市景象，幾與新年相仿，市商會業已發出通吿，勸令復業，今日將一律開市。</p>
<h3>煤價難平　交通受限制　運銷不自由</h3>
<p>本市煤斤一項，因天時已寒，需要激增，致市價昂　，現烟煤每噸已漲至四十萬大關，市民煮炊之煤球，每担亦漲至一萬二三千元，且時吿缺貨，威脅民生殊鉅，據燃料管委會方面稱，目前最大之困難，即爲運輸問題，因各產煤區煤斤運滬數量，如不受交通上之限制，則足敷全市需要，現台灣亦可有大量運出，故煤斤來源，自不成問題，現正接洽調撥專輪，赴產煤地區運煤，俾本市存底日益充沛，黑市價格自可消滅云云，按本市烟煤產銷，均由上海區燃料管理委員會嚴格統制，商人不得自由採運，因該會對配貨又予以限制，致市價飛漲不已。</p>
<h3>福建紙廠復興</h3>
<p>〔中央社福州卅日電〕南僑經建公司備案問題，省府已允予核准，該公司頃決定投資創辦福州自來水公司及復興福建造紙廠，按該廠規模龐大，戰前日出竹漿六噸，製紙五噸，最高產紙十餘噸，於廿七年被炸停工，損失頗重。</p>
<h3>食油聯配會議表　全市分七區配售　市價低於議價即照市價出售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食油聯配處昨日下午四時有重要會議，出席者有張超陳中和秦林生張可嘉等十人，由張超主席，當決定各項要事如下：（一）經常費之負擔，原則上由該業廠商津貼，如有不足，再請各業補助。（二）食油之分配，全市分七區辦理。七區爲浦東區，閘北區，滬東區，舊八區，滬南區，滬西區，及中區。七區下分設六十六組，各區之組數，視人口之多寡而異，不作統一規定。每組設主任一人，負責三十家之食油供應事宜。先詳細調査用戶之實際需要量，然後儘量供給。至於售價，會中決定如市價低於議價時，則照市價出售；反之如市價高於議價時，則按議價出售。將來食油數量如嫌不足，則吳市長過去已有指示，可由中國食油公司補助。今日聯配處各負責人將晋謁吳市長，有所報吿。</p>
<h3>美國拋售存鬃　影響川鬃出口</h3>
<p>川鬃品質，超乎國內各地之上，國外工廠，極爲樂用，過去美政府有拋售存鬃十萬磅之議，川鬃市塲，亦受影響，價格降至二元七角一磅，近來仍以供求關係，猪鬃市塲，又見活躍，市價轉見上升，每磅升至二元九角五，上月運出一千六百餘担，本月成交較大，約計二千一百祖，已運出一千八百餘担，月底尙有三百担裝出，昨日出口業接獲紐約電訊，美政府又將出售存貨，如果屬實，我猪鬃必遭受打擊無疑，據川猪鬃業人士表示：如美市價轉跌，決不貪做，因目前川中成本業已加高，二元九角五之價，幾無利可獲也。聞中信局爲償債關係，擬訂購川鬃二千担，昨已與畜產，和源兩公司簽訂一千一百担之合約，其餘九百担，即與寳體，崇德兩公司辦理手續。</p>
<h3>小五金營業不振</h3>
<p>本市五金另件業公會各會員，目前營業淸淡，已達於最不景氣之現象，據悉其原因大部以五金材料成本過高，會員中多受高利貸剝削，且推銷呆滯，目前營業已一落千丈。</p>
<h3>美軍乘餘物資中　有三萬五千噸新藥　阿達別林可供全國五年之用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕值此國家工商業風雨飄搖之時，新藥業之發展，亦受相當影響。記者昨特往訪本市新藥商業同業公會理事長史致富君，承吿目前新藥業雖較半年前營業衰落，但大致尙無嚴重現象，一般說來，本年六月份以前所進貨物，目前仍有盈利，六月份以後到貨，因美海員長期罷工，致利息損失，同時新藥進貨並無統計，業外人紛紛訂貨，又有直接自國外寄來之郵包藥品，亦頗影響同業營業，虧蝕者頗多。　又據史氏吿稱：行政院物資供應局在太平洋十六島購買美軍乘餘物資內有各項藥品達三萬五千噸，共計一千九百餘種，聞治瘧疾用阿達別林存儲靑島，其數足可供全華五年之用，有謂立達貿易行所購進藥物，僅僅係島外之垃圾，以形容其物資之多。該項藥品，將於數月後陸續運來，然後由各方會同新藥業公會商討分配，對於此項物資之配給，將另有一新機構成立。以後市上藥物價格富可穩定。同時爲顧及製藥業業務起見，新藥業絕對採取與藥廠密切合作，製藥原料，儘量先供藥廠應用，並予以種種便利。如國內交通暢通，則本國藥廠出產藥品，以及現存藥房貨物，均可大量運銷各地，藥業前途，頗爲樂觀。但據史氏談稱，此項剩餘藥物，多係外科用藥，普通藥房所需者，僅其中十分之一或二。</p>
<h3>貨運減少　噸位過剩</h3>
<p>據航業界息：戰前我全國航輪共有五十餘萬噸，外加太古。怡和等公司，航輪四十萬噸，惟當時我國航輸經常有十萬噸租與其他外商小公司，故實際上中華商使用者僅四十萬噸左右，因當時有外商航輪加入行駛，故四十萬噸在運輸上已足够應付，目前全國航輪共有六十萬噸，其中新近向美購入者約二十萬噸，唯近兩月內，受市面不景氣影響，貨運逐步退减，範圍較小之公司，均感維持不易，如照目前情形觀察，即有五十萬噸之航輪，對運輸上，亦可維持云。</p>
<h3>合作工廠四所　兩所不能用　資金成問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於絲綢合作工廠組織事，最近經社會部全國合作供銷處，中蠶公司，社會局三方面詳加商討後，發現最大之困難在資金之措籌。經濟部允撥四個工廠中，有兩廠因內部物資及其他原因，不能使用，故實際可辦者僅有兩廠。辦理兩個合作工廠之預定資本爲八億元，但中　及社會部方面僅能合出五千萬元。原定工人負担之股本爲一億元，現所能收容之工人僅一百餘人，能否認足預定股份，顯成問題。而目前一般絲綢業不景氣，將來合作工廠之維持與發展，亦屬困難之工作。惟雖有以上之難題，三方面仍將積極籌備，自吸收資本着手，使合作工廠之理想成爲事實云。</p>
<h3>金價太高　將招徠大批私貨</h3>
<p>〔華東社〕最近本市金價暴漲，因少數人誤認金價比較低廉，紛紛扒購，惟據金融界消息，本市金價實馬極高，美國財政部現存黃金共五七六，五〇三，三五三盎斯，計値二〇，二一二，六一七·五〇四美元，依美官方估計，每盎斯不遇三十五美元，則每盎斯僅值法幣十一萬七千二百五十元，較目前上海黃金市價相差一倍又牛以上，故依國際黃金市價而論，萬金價除近東方面數小國家以外，上海金價已爲般高，如由美國，加拿大，或墨西哥等地運金來滬納售，可獲巨利，故國際走私商，均紛將私運黃金來滬，以圖厚利。</p>
<h3>臺省工業恢復迅速</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關人士吿記者：台灣工業之恢復，甚爲迅速。以電力而論，去年十二月之發電量爲四萬瓩，九月份約爲十二萬瓩，十一月份可達十六萬瓩。目前合省工業之主要工作，並非創辦而爲修復，因戰時該省之工業，曾有50％之損失也。至於修復之速度，繫於物力人力之能迅速集中。以人力而論，最近有大批技術人員赴台工作，物力方面，大部工業器材之補充，爲自行總救濟物資及美軍剩餘物資所撥付者。過去所接收之器材中，以織業器材佔最大比例。目前大琉球島之剩餘物資，正在分類整理中，將來當可撥得」部份交通工具。又工作母機過去亦自救濟物資內獲取一部份，實爲合省工業復興中不可缺之物資。</p>
<h3>放寬工商貸款　辦法尚在研討中</h3>
<p>據金融業方面消息，關於工商生產貸款現政府已有寬放之憲，以消弭高利之弊，如能寬放，高利貸當可稍低，聞是項生產貸款之放寬辦法，國家銀行已正愼密研討中，據悉，本月中旬即可實行。</p>
<h3>週末美棉回跌</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約三十日電〕棉花遠期較上日略跌，晨開漲落互見，後市賣氣甚盛，收盤每包跌一角至一元七角五分。又紐奧林斯電：棉花遠期因週末拋售，價趨下游，收盤每包跌七角至一元九角五分。</p>
<h3>日本棉毛織物奉令運往朝鮮</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京三十日電〕麥帥頃命令日本政府以毛織物三十萬磅，棉毛織物一七八·二八三磅運往朝鮮，以解救該處之寒衣恐慌。</p>
<h3>美國庫收入額</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三十日電〕晨業經濟局估計，一九四七年度美國國庫收入總數，將達一七五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元，今年的爲一六五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元。</p>
<h3>美煙草豐收</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三十日電〕本年度美國烟草收獲，估計的爲二·二四八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅，爲歷史上最大之收獲，較去年增加百分之十二。</p>

<h3>高稅率破壞了商業道德</h3>
<p>— 甘允壽</p>
<p>光陰飛也似的過去，轉瞬間，又要歡迎三十六年的元且，工商界也要循例地換置一套的新帳簿了。我們在此殷切希望着，這一年度的新帳簿，必須要表示眞實確切的狀况切勿再蹈覆轍，老是表示着不正確，不淸楚的記錄。不過話得說回來。過去帳目，所以造成不確實的結果，那也有，它不得已的苦衷和原因。我們站在客觀的立塲來觀察，實在不便過於苛責和批判。因爲捐稅太繁重，（營業稅印花稅利息所得稅所利得稅等）通貨繼續在膨脹，這是鐵一般的事實。商人們爲了保持它原有的基礎，把資產或損益的一部份帳目，設法秘密隱藏起來，這也是由於事實上的需要，不能完全說它是不對，試想：如果忠實地儘量表示出來，豈不要减少它原有的資產，和影響它的生存？舉一個例來說罷：民國三十四年度的所利得我，照稅局簡化稽征的規定，是按三十四年度各業的淨利，再加上百分之五十課征的。如果三十五年度的所利得稅，等到來年開征時，當局重施故技，再來一次加上百分之五十，或一百課征，他們還能負祖得了嗎？過去課稅，旣然不合理，那麽，對於將來，當然不得不有所警惕。爲今之計，欲期來年度工商業帳目的確實，惟有期望稅收當局，對下列各點，必須切實做到。第一，對於三十五年度所利得稅的課征辦法，必須要有明確而具體的表示，絕對不再依據三十四年度的老辦法課稅，以免引起商人的猜疑，和誤會。第二，對於直接稅中各種稅率，必須重行修正，切實减低。近來有一部份批發業，據說：在每筆交易中，除去了印花稅和營業稅後所獲毛利極微，甚或無利可圖，或竟發生損失。此外所得的淨利，又幾乎大部份要獻諸政府，像去年的辦法，還要按淨利加上百分之五十報繳。因此商人們談到納稅問題，大家都感到頭痛和恐懼。他們的腦筋，自然而然地，要轉到如何逃稅道方面去。所以稅率不减低，各業的帳目，假帳不容易消滅。第三，對於稅務人員的待遇，必須予以合理的調整，以免發生不正當行爲，帮助着破壞稅法。古人說過：衣食足，而後知榮辱。近來報紙上常常揭發稅務人員的食汚行爲。這就是說明：一方面稅率太高，商人多要逃稅；另一方面待遇太低，少數官吏，不得不和商人串通一氣，做出種種不合法的勾當來。因此提高待遇，和减低稅率，實爲當前的急務。以上幾點，倘蒙當局採納施行，我想信來年度工商業的帳目，一定會比較的忠實和正確，商人們，決不願故意爲虛偽的記載，當然也不會有二套三套以上的帳簿，同時國家的稅收，也決不會比現在差了多少。</p>

<h3>教部指定四大學設置南洋學生獎學金　三十六年度起開始申請</h3>

<p>教育研究</p>
<h3>電化教育實施問題</h3>
<p>— 杜維濤</p>
<p>一　問題的提出</p>
<p>電化敎育，在我國實施已經有十年的歷史了。起初的時候，推行很是順利，敎育部提倡領導於上，各省市敎育廳局以及其他敎育機關努力推動於下。應用的器材，國內有一部分可以自造，向國外孵置並不困難，價格亦不很貴，所以很能風行。假使不遭遇這八年抗戰的厄運，早應該普遍於全國各級學校社會敎育機關和一般民間了。抗戰開始以後，原有推行電化敎育的機構，逐漸撤銷裁併，器材損失毁壞既多，又無法大量補充，價格昻貴，來源缺乏，一年比一年艱難。雖然想盡了方法，也是扶得東來西又倒，幾乎無法維持下去了。但是從客觀環境來看反是一年比一年更加需要。八年當中，電化敎育亦能擔負起抗戰的使命，而格外增高他的身價。到處是那樣的熟烈的歡迎，迫切的期待，使我們這少數工作人員感覺無法應付。明明看出電化敎育是這樣的需要，這樣的有效，實在不忍放棄我們僅有的破舊器材，不得不忍受極端的艱苦而盡我們最大的努力。如此說來電化敎育的實施，在客觀方面並沒有問題，學校與社會民衆紙有一天天的增加他們的熟望，過分的困難，祗在於器材缺乏，經費短絀，和人員缺少。然而，時至今日，情形有些改變，物質的困難之外，又加上心理的困難了。物質困難容易解決，心理的困難，却不容易克服。抗戰勝利以後，器材來源將不成問題，問題在有沒有經費去買，經費的有無多少，問題在各級主管人肯不肯分配，至於人才戰後能否大量的培植，也在於各級主管人的決定。說來說去，現在的根本問題，是在各級敎育行政機關沒有重視這項敎育！沒有深切的認識客觀的需要，沒有完全明瞭牲的偉大的功能，所以把他放在一切敎育事業的最末後。電北敎育的不能發展，可以說不是器材經費和人才的無辦法，而是因爲他被放在最來後的地位，沒有機會抬起頭來。我說這句話，大的從事電化敎育和社會敎育工作的人都會承認的。所以電化敎育的實施問題，第一是打破心理上的難關，祇要各級敎育行政機關有決心來推行電化敎育，能重視電化敎育，那末器材經費人才的困難，都可以迎刃而解。</p>
<p>二　實施的經過</p>
<p>電化敎育，在十多年以前是由於熱心科學敎育和社會敎育的人士鼓吹倡導起來的。首先在若干科學敎育社會敎育團體中實騐推行，由京滬一帶而向南向北發展。實施最早的是江蘇省鎭江及徐州兩民衆教育館實施得很有成續，而浙江、福建、江西、湖南、廣東、廣西，都逐漸的發展起來。學校中，以金陵大學、大夏大學、江蘇省立敎育學院、推行較早，成績也好。那時幻燈電影和播音都已用作敎學工具了，而且有很多地方能自行攝製敎育影片，鎭江民衆敎育館並首先利用汽車來施行電敎，至今被人艷稱。金陵大學首先設立敎育電影部，並創設電化敎育專修科，培養電敎人才。江蘇省立敎育學院，在民國二十五年也設立了電化敎育專修科。敎育部鑒於電化敎育事業的重要，從民國二十四年起，就開始領導督促推行，大量購置各種電影播音器材，分發各省敎育機關應用，部內組設電影敎育播音敎育兩個委員會，並開辦電化敎育人員訓練班，先後共辦三期，受訓卒業者達三百二十二人。抗戰開始以後，這兩個委員會合併成爲電化敎育委員會，又於社會敎育司，設第三科，辦理電敎。三十一年，設立中華敎育電影製片廠，專製十六毫米敎育影片，並於國立社會敎育學院中，設置電化敎育專修科，培養人才。各省則於教育廳內，設電化教育服務處（戰後改組爲輔導處），另設電化敎育巡廻工作隊，多的有七八隊，少的也有兩三隊。各學校及社會敎育機關，多裝有收音機，並有少數省分，籌設教育廣播電台。電化敎育的推行，在戰前短短的兩三年內，已經風靡一時了。抗戰開始以後，各省電敎機構和器材，雖然逐漸毁損滅少，而在敎育部方面還是設法補助維持，在沒有辦法的當中想辦法，並且組織部屬電敎隊直接推廣施敎工作。國立社會敎育學院電敎專修科，曾一度改爲獨立的電化敎育專科學校終因器材經費和人才的困難而還了原狀。中華製片廠努力了幾年，也完成了五十部影片，也可算竭盡了能力到抗戰最後的一兩年，電敎推行才到最艱難最緊縮的時期，敎育部電化敎育委員會撤銷，祗有社會敎育司第三科辦理電敎工作。然而整理法令加緊硏究實騐工作，設法向國內外覓購器材，加强國際合作，擬具熾後發展計劃，聯合英美兩新聞處，努力幻燈與電影的抗戰宣傳，不但沒有在這最艱苦的兩年中冷落了工作，並且奠定了戰後發展的基礎。如此說來，電敎的實施，在電敎崗位上的人，已盡了最大的努力，現在時機好轉，正可以大有作爲，但需要熱心電敎和工作崗位上的人土，再來作廣大的宣傳，與竭力的提倡。</p>
<p>三　今後的努力</p>
<p>現在我們努力的事項，就是賡續奠定電化敎育基礎，提高電化敎育的地位，擴充電化敎育的財源，俾置備器材，增加機構和人員，訓練人才，能同時併進。不過，我們檢討以往的得失，還可以發覺。過去有一種最大錯誤，就是過分把電敎事業當做行政工作了，一切徒然仰仗政府來支持，下層沒有一點基礎，人民沒有參與這項事業，商人根本不來過問，這恰恰和電化敎育最發達的英美相反。中國是一個窮苦的國家，樣樣事業仰仗政府力量，人民和團體不自行努力，怎能不有這樣的結果呢？電化教育雖是化錢的事，但不一定賠本，將來是可以賺錢的。倘使人民自已來辦，商人踴躍投資，銷塲不須顧慮。例如出版事業，新聞事業，廣播事業，都是敎育文化事業，政府縱然要監督管制，但這都是社會事業，也都是一種企業。電影播音幻燈等器材製造，是一種工業，應用來施教，就是社會事業，人民應該自己努力創辦，政府再從而監督協助，如果這樣做，早就發展起來了。試看英美的敎育影片，都是各影片公司出品。學校和敎育機關裏應用的電影播音器材都是自備，不是上級敎育行政機關發給的。關於這些事業的提倡與發展，政府並未用多大的力。我國雖然和英美情形不同，不能不田政府先行倡導，但電化敎育事業，不能專賴政府力量當作政令推行，這個道理總是不錯的！說到這裏，再兜轉活頭，希望政府在人民和地方沒有力量自行舉辦的時候，仍然用更大的注意力來推動這種敎育事業，尤其在目前更要確定方針，制定政策，先作一種推動，然後再期望人民和地方自動。同時也希望一般敎育人士多多從下層努力，用自已的力量，做自已的事業，不但電化敎育事業是如此，凡百建設國事業都應該如此的。（卅五年十一月卅日於敎育部）</p>

<h3>巡視冀魯豫</h3>
<p>— 十一月廿四日航訊　本報開封記者王瘦梅</p>
<p>輕裝離沙城</p>
<p>十一月十六日的早晨，和綏的朝陽剛照遍了大地，來　記者的吉普車，已開到了記者門口，六十八軍的尹參議，匆匆跳下軍，催記者動身，記者穿上大衣，提着照像機，一點行李沒帶，就輕裝上車，在司機。上坐下。一點也沒有躭擱，車子一溜烟開了。</p>
<p>十分鐘後，車子已開出了這古老的沙城，一直正東，走上了往曹州去的平坦大道。司機的王麻十，是六十八軍的汽車隊長，以他姗熱老練的技術，把一部運用自如的車子放在平坦光滑的公路上，眞是四平八穩，疾馳如飛，如果把眼睛閉起來，幾乎疑惑到自己又在空中飛行。</p>
<p>碧澄澄的天空，好做一池秋水，靜靜的，運一點波紋也沒有。沒有一點風，沒有一點土，整個的大地都沈醉在那媚人的朝陽中，大地上的一切，又好像在作着輕飄的夢，是那樣恬適，神秘，誰也不相信這是北國初冬的早晨！</p>
<p>野狗跟在車子後面追，但被落後了，小島在天空間與車爭先，也被落後了，絡繹不絕的大卡車，看見後邊來了吉普眾馬上就讓道，我們的吉普車流星一般向東駛進，七十分鐘，走完了開封到開封一百里的路程。在關封停了四十分鐘，吃過了早點，再上車向向東北行。四十五分鐘，到了考城，未作停留，即繞城而過，因沿途向前方輸送給養的汽車充塞着道路，致使我們的大吉普，也不得不走走停停。大的離開考城四十分鐘光景，尹景胡兄就吿訴記者，已進入了冀魯豫邊區，也就是不久以前的共軍「解放區」。記者聽了「解放」二字以後，精神上不自禁的受了一點威脅與拘束，兩隻眼睛也不自主的向四下張望，但，這兒的公路修的很寬，很平，四野聞的農夫也還在安閒自在的做工，就是只見炊烟不見村樹，天空中的飛鳥似乎也特別少，記者心裏正在納悶，恰好司機的王隊長指給記者道：「不久以前我們的第三軍就是在這兒和共軍遭遇的，這兒現在的血腥味，雖然沒有了，但沒掩埋好的死屍，時常被野狗拉在當路上，我第一次開車過這裏時，遍地都是死人，村子裏通一個人也看不見。」我有點毛骨悚然了，我知道我已踏入了「今戰塲」，沒有憑弔的哀思，只有恐怖的感覺，我怕看見那些寃死者的死屍，我怕聞見那股刺人心脾的血腥，閉上限睛，掩住鼻孔，我希望車子很快的把我駛過這個可怕的地帶。</p>
<p>刁莊戒備嚴</p>
<p>二時左右車到了離曹州五十里的刁莊，這是一個小村子，可是這里却做了天羅地綱般的防禦工事，新築的寨牆上，三步一碉，五步一堡，滾木，擂石佈滿了牆頭。寨牆外繞着深溝，深溝里放着河水，溝外邊是荆棘作成的障碍物，緊緊圍着深溝，這一道障碍物之外，還有兩層用短木椿做成的圍牆，三層圍牆抱圍着一道深溝，一溝深水又環繞着堅固的寨牆，我們的汽車就在第一一道障碍物里邊通過。寨牆上的哨兵，從鋼盔下邊露出兩隻圓大的眼睛，向着公路上的行旅注視着，當哨兵把眼光注射到我身上的那一霎那間，我的神經上也不自禁的起了個痙摩，我問尹參議這兒爲什麼這樣警戒森嚴，他說這兒是個重要據點，距此地不遠的鄕村里，還潛伏着零星的共軍，出沒無常，不得不特別防範。車上六七個武裝兵，這時不的而同的都把槍推上了子彈，插上了刺刀，他們把眼睛監視着路上的行人，一直到車子走遠了，他們才另找新的目標，這時候我好像自己已罩身戰塲。</p>
<p>三點鐘，車子終於平安的抵達了曹州。</p>
<p>走馬看曹州</p>
<p>「曹州」，這是歷史上的地理名詞，現在已不是曹州府，而是菏澤縣了，在春秋時候是曹國，在淸朝時候是曹州府治，到民國時候，因這兒有萬貢的菏澤，所以說改爲荷澤縣了。這兒在過去由於地理形勢上的重要，物產的豐富，因而形成了他在政治，經濟，文化，各方面都處於魯西的領導地位，他是魯西的重鎭，他有輝煌燦爛的歷史，歷史上也有他輝煌燦爛的地位。他會孕育過在中國歷史上大露頭角的人物，水滸傳上的英雄好漢，大多數都是這兒人，我們該不會忘記抗戰的史詩上第一個把生命貢獻給祖國的趙登禹將軍吧？他的家就在這荷澤縣城。</p>
<p>這里的確是一個好地方，可是如今她已經成了雨打過的梨花，被摧殘過了的美人。古老宏偉的建築，多已門窗俱無，當年的的繁華，而今只落得一片荒凉！街道上雖然也有幾家商店，却是門雖設而常關，即令開着門，也是有架無貨，倒是街心里幾處賣玻璃梳子的小攤販，却在兜攬買主，然而在那求生不易的飢荒之鄉，仍不免也袖起手來，常坐冷板櫈。這里沒有包辦酒席的火飯莊，只有賣饅頭麵條約小飯鋪。行人很稀落，入夜更蕭條，如果沒有後方補給機關大批送給養的汽車來來往往，你會疑惑這是一座死城。這座歷史上的古城，平時聚積着四萬多人口，從去年九月廿四日被共軍佔領後，逃走了三分之二，今年八月二十四日共軍退却時又被裏　去了三分之一，國軍克復這個古城的時候，城裏邊幾乎沒有人了。據一個篤信天主的老頭說；「共軍撤退時，逼着老百姓塡井，逼着老百姓逃走，塡水井誰也不願塡，而且都在觀望着不想逃走，他們威脅着說：你們不逃，國軍來了是要殺光的，老百姓沒知識，於是都逃了，國軍進城的時候，全城不知道有幾個老頭老婆，可是不久，他們逃走的都漸漸的回來了，到現在城內又有三萬來人了，這一點不能不歸功劉汝珍軍長，劉軍長進駐曹州以後，安撫流亡，辦理救濟，爲農民買種十，爲住戶修房屋，軍紀嚴明，有口皆碑，因之逃難他鄕的，都扶老携幼歸來了。」</p>
<p>大街小巷的牆壁上，到處都是紅字白邊的標語，但新標語下邊是舊標語，舊標語下邊還有一層更糢糊的標語，新標語是國軍寫的，舊標語是共軍寫的，最下層糢糊的標語是敵僞寫的，三層標語代表三個時期，這說明了曹州的老百姓這些年來過的是什麽生活。</p>
<p>戰前這里是山東敎育文化最發遠的地方，省立師範，省立中學，在山東都是成績最好的，就是小學也辦得非常好，因爲這里曾經是山東的實騐縣，所以這里從前幾乎沒有失學的兒童。可是現在呢，這個文化之城，却連一個學校也沒有：學校里房倒屋塌，荒草沒脛，學齡兒童滿街都是，而且最短期內，還沒有開學的準備和希望，這是多麽傷心和可怕的事喲！</p>
<p>這里的城牆，在抗戰初起時，被國軍拆毁了，敵僞時期，逼着老百姓又修了起來，去年敵寇投降，共軍佔領了之後，再逼着老百姓拆得乾乾凈凈，這次被國軍收復，兩個月功夫，老百姓在國軍的領導下，又把這個週圍十里的城牆修好了，而且修得異常堅固壯觀，城牆上幾乎可以走汽車，城牆外是深欇，工程之艱鉅，人力之偉大，亦不能不算奇蹟，劉軍長汝珍陪記者作環城巡禮時，他很感慨的說：　爲了防禦內亂動員這樣大的民力，做這樣大的工程，這眞是莫大的寃枉和浪費，如果共軍放下了屠刀，我們解甲歸田，老百姓把這一支偉大的力量整個用在生產事業上，那將有多少收獲呢？』我點點頭，嘆了口氣。在城牆上補修城堵的一個老頭却在邊做邊說：『軍長，道不要緊，我們老百姓沒有別的，就有這麽一點傻力氣，只要從道一次以後國軍能把這城池永遠保住，不讓我們再拆再修，我們就感激不盡了。』記者望望劉軍長，劉軍長向那老人笑了笑。</p>

<h3>縣長談赤色恐怖</h3>
<p>菏澤現在是山東第十六區專員公署所在地，縣政府和專員公署各立門戶，記者爲明瞭這里在共軍佔領時期的軍事政治經濟措置情形起見，曾經分訪了朱專員和張縣長，張縣長是本縣人，過去當過區長，現在縣長兼黨部書記長，地方情形很熟悉，據他說，共軍佔領荷澤不久，『冀魯豫邊區政府』就在道里成立行署，荷澤改成市政府，把縣城同堤口以內的地方都劇歸荷澤市管轄，舊有荷澤縣屬却又分成荷澤，南華，臨澤，齊濱四個縣。所謂『冀魯豫邊區』是歸「晋冀魯豫邊區政府」管轄的，（所在地是邯鄲）除此外，尙包括太行，太岳，冀南邊區。它包括獨石路以南，平漢路以柬，隴海路以北，津浦路以西的區域。在行署行政組織上，有民財建敎四處，工商，交通，公安三局。跟着共軍統治力量的加強，農會，婦女會，兒童團，也都成立了起來。在四鄕里，共軍是先派『抗聯』去的，這是他們的組織人員，他們一手製造成農會，然後就組織『槍班』，道是最要緊的一步工作，表面上是以地方的武力保護地方，實際上是共軍擴軍的基層工作，農民們經過他們一個時期的『炮製』，就被迫着加入共軍了，在各地作戰陣亡的，百分之九十以上，是這些經『炮製』而加入共軍的共軍。前次共軍進攻豫東時，死傷遍野，那都是這里的善良百姓，所以這里的老弱婦孺永遠忘不了共軍的仇恨，共軍的把戲也永遠迷惑不住他們了。共黨在這兒也成立了好多合作社，而且他們的工作人員也從事經商牟利，可是他們的烟廠却壟斷市塲，他們的工廠也享受着專利，商人們苦不堪言，可是仍不許關門，如果你歇業，他就『爲了生產』，把商人的全部房屋，貨物，傢具都接受去他們自已作。在他們這樣的工商政策之下，就造成了商業蕭條，經濟崩潰的現象，這情形非三年五年能夠恢復。</p>
<p>記者又問張縣長縣城收復後，縣政府都作了些什麼事情，他說：「共軍走後，縣府主要是招撫流亡，緊接着來的，就是共軍給遺留下來葛的糾，土地，房產，婚姻，寃仇這些案子可把縣府忙懷了，到現在縣府還是爲這些事情忙着，比如土地在當時是被「鬥爭」分過的，主權常然還在地主，但地主有的是爲交「鬥爭」罰款而將土地變賣給另外的人了，這可就麻煩了。報復的案件特別多，但不是特別重大的案件，我們總是給他們和解的，因爲那些被利用的犯罪者，都是些地痞，流氓，毫無知識的可憐虫，我們不願他們再結寃仇，再演悲劇。」</p>
<p>揮涙話「鬥爭」</p>
<p>在「解放區」裏，處處流行着「鬥爭」的口號，惟有「鬥爭」窮人們才能「分錢」，惟有「門爭」奴隸們才能「翻身」，這是共黨一貫的宣傳的綱領。究竟怎樣「鬥爭」呢？記者可以拿這里澡塘趙老闆的一段話回答讀者。他是一個六十歲的忠厚老人，在共軍佔領期間，他沒有逃脫，曾經和許多沒有逃了的人一樣，被「鬥爭」過兩次，他說：「共軍入城以後，我爲了家庭，爲了生意，我沒得逃脫、我被逮住了，家里被搶了個光，孩子也被抓了去，生意歇了業，我想死也死不了，平常那些地痞，流氓，無賴，潑婦，都成了要人，共軍就集合起這些東西，向一般老實人「鬥爭」，現在雖然我很可憐他們，可是在當時頭腦簡單的他們，在「抗聯」「基幹班」的支持下，確實作了不少孽，他們在一般人的心田中，確實種下了不能忘記的仇恨。」「到底怎麽樣進行「鬥爭」呢？」我問他。他繼續說：「共軍的「鬥爭」大會開始以前，是經過好久準備和運用的，想「鬥爭」誰，就先由「抗聯」指示給「基幹班」再授意「農會」，發動「會員」製造被「鬥爭」者的罪行，在威脅，利誘之下，把這雙簧演成，我是今年二月十一被「鬥爭」的，那天他們集合了幾百人，速我澡塘里的小茶房都弄去了，先把我推到戲台上，然後有一個「　斡班」的工作人員高聲問台下的人爲什麽要「鬥爭」我，台下有的說從前我打罵過他，有的說他以前借我錢我沒借，他又問我澡塘里的小茶房我是怎樣虐待他們，那些小孩子都沒啥說，他竟打他們了兩嘴巴，這然後把我踢倒在戲台上，要我「坦白坦白」，我沒有做過虧心事，當然沒有說的，可是就在這時，那些兒童團就在人家威逼之下，向我臉上洒尿了，那個「基幹班」的工作人員，並且叱喝着我把嘴張開，我只得照辦了。這個尿完，那個尿，我不知道喝了多少，後來我聽說如果我不承認，他們就要當衆處我死刑，我只得高聲呌了，我說我「混蛋」，我說我「剝削窮人」，我說我「虐待學徒」，這時台下的羣衆在一種操縱這下齊聲說：「打死他！」「制裁他！」我低下頭，等着他們發落。不留神，「撲擦」一聲，一個生鷄蛋擲在我的臉上了，蛋白蛋黃弄的我滿臉流，但不准我擦，台下是一片笑聲。又停一會，一隻紙糊的高帽子被套在我的頭上了，他們把我綁起來，遊街了，遊遍了城內的大街小巷，我喊自己「混蛋」已經力竭聲嘶了。這天晚上他們要罰我的款，他們要的數目是二百萬，我因爲沒有錢，他們過着我　澡塘，可是我又標賣不出去，最後選是賣給他們，又是沒見現歡。他們說已撥了。」他說到這裏，老淚縱橫，不忍重述，半天我才又問他道：「在這樣『鬥爭』之下，城裘邊的老百姓對共軍怎麽權呢？」他說：「不論窮富，人人恐怖，當時有些歌謠說：</p>
<p>—一畝二畝門前站，三畝四畝是罪犯，五畝以上大混蛋，沒有房地是神仙—</p>
<p>—大公鷄，尾巴長，農會會長　閻王，一說沒有就遭殃—</p>
<p>—一顆樹，光堂堂，騎着大馬回故鄉，屋也塌，糧也完，爹媽見了淚汪汪—</p>
<p>—白顆樹，開白花，八路軍來了就抄家—</p>
<p>—八路軍閙得兇，見了鬼子不敢衝，白天嚇的不敢動，晚上出來抖威風，抓住娘娘要軍糧，抓住嫂嫂要衣裳—</p>
<p>—八路軍，愛鈔票，一見財主拚命要，財主一聲說沒有，，立刻戴土「頑固」帽—</p>
<p>聽了這些歌謠，你就知道當時老百姓的情形了。」</p>
<p>曹州城防司令葛開祥少將（大報記者王瘦梅攝）</p>
<h3>趙將軍故鄉老母　在院內揀棉花晚景蕭條</h3>
<p>趙登禹將軍用他的鮮血寫下了抗戰史的第一頁，他的忠魂永遠埋在地下，他的英名永遠留在人問，他的身後到底怎麼樣呢？記者旣然到了將軍之鄕，就不能不訪問訪問將軍之家了。將軍之家在城西北角，一所半舊的院落，失去了大門和門檻，滿院荒凉，一堂寥落，三間上房，塌了中間，東西兩廂，也像寒堂古廟，陰森森，使人置身其間‘不禁有點毛骨悚然。將軍有老母，年已八旬，耳聾眼不花，老態龍鍾，狀至可憐，記者去時，將軍之母正在院內揀棉花，記者叩以家庭生活狀况，承她吿記者說：「沒辦法，不得了，牛也沒有了，糧也沒有了，孩子一死什麼都完了，要不是總司令（按係指劉汝明將軍）送麥種，送錢，我們這一家就活不成」！她說着，身上只發抖，記者感慨萬千，趕快替她老人家拍了一個照片，就到了前院。聽說將軍有妻有弟，亦有子女，但子女却始終以時光不好，家境蕭條，沒有機會去受敎育，將軍爲國亡，身後竟如此，眞使人爲之哀悼悲憤！</p>
<p>牡丹甲天下</p>
<p>曹州牡丹甲天下，這里是牡丹的王國，讀過聊齋誌異和中國舊小說的，當可知道在多年前這里就以牡丹出名了，這里的牡丹，種類之多，爲全國冠種植面積之廣，也駭人聽聞，行銷地區，遠至廣東南洋，近至平津京滬，只要有牡丹，不消說，都是曹州去的，人人都說洛陽牡丹好，豈知曹州是娘家，曹州人常常是以此自豪的。</p>
<p>牡丹鄕在曹州城東北七里之趙樓一帶，記者曾乘吉普市到那里去做過探花郞，牡丹鄕約十頃之大，松栢林立，環境幽美，只可惜人間無春，花不開，所能看到的，乃是遍地香塚，（牡丹天生弱質，不禁酷寒，故到冬天就埋起來）記者僅在花鄕唏噓嗟嘆了一陣，就依依返城了。</p>
<p>在曹州承劉汝珍將軍款留了三天，二十號早晨駕車言旋，匆匆的歸來，正如匆匆的去。離開曹州時，我還把頭轉回去悵望着這個乍晤乍別的古城，一直到雲烟遮住了她的面龐，我才望着自已的歸路。</p>
<p>怕處有鬼，偏偏車子到了危險地帶的彭莊拋錨，在焦急與恐怖中修理了三個鐘頭，才修好了，開足馬力，下午四時才到了考城。飢腸朧朧，疲憊不堪，到考城五十五軍軍部，承理區軍長款以炸　　，不敢久停，即再趕路。開車時已四點半了，到開封選有一百七十里，司機的焦急，記者更焦急，路上人車已很少了。一輪將要落山的紅日，向着大地作着留戀的微笑，車子風馳常掣般的向着他追，他一點一點的往下沈，車子也一跳一跳的向前追，可是終於沒有追上，他沈下去了，大地上呈現出隱的的黃昏景色，沙城何在？我體味着：「涼風不管征衣薄落日方知行路難！」那兩句詩了。</p>
<p>車進蘭封的時候，已經是萬家燈火了，沒辦法，只得去拜訪第四綏靖區司令官劉汝明將軍，名片遞進去，劉將軍親自笑迎了出來，他說：「接到五十五軍電話，知你今晚必住此，我已候駕多時了！」這時我也不禁笑了。　吃了晚飯，同劉將軍談了兩個鐘顯，他把他幼年從軍，壯年帶兵，孤軍當南口之險，走馬解西安之圍這些德事，歷歷如數家珍般的說了一遍，使我一身疲困消失凈盡，我對這位雍容儒將起了無限的興趣，最還是他催我就寢，我才去睡了。</p>
<p>夜半槍聲</p>
<p>睡夢中，忽然被密集的機關槍聲驚醒了，我迷迷惘惘的不知所措，楊副官主任知道我已被驚醒，又怕我膽小，不住的和我說：「沒有事，沒有事，不必驚慌‘」可是他自己把電話聽筒拿在手裏，到處問訊，但那里也弄不淸楚、槍聲是斷斷續續的響，消息是片片段段的來，最後才知道是城西五六里地的張良墳一帶，國軍發見共軍在破壞鐵路，開機關槍，把共軍趕走了，一塲虛驚，所幸有驚無傷，我又睡着了。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，劉將軍爲我備了西點，在進早點的時候，他告訴我東明，長垣地區共軍集結了幾萬人，正在醞釀一個新的戰爭，說不盡要再向我防區作孤注一擲，現我方已有新部署，如果他們眞要來碰釘子，那就只有忍痛消滅他們了。我順着他的手指看着地圖，心裏却想着：狂暴又欲來，斯民何辜？</p>
<p>上了車，到開封，已經十二點了。</p>
<h3>暹羅僑胞</h3>
<p>— 十四日曼谷航訊　本報旅行記者黃澍蓀</p>
<p>暹校加授華文</p>
<p>我國旅外僑胞，數達子萬以上，暹羅佔了三分之一。無論是大埠小鎮，無論是窮鄕僻壤，到處都有他們居處其關，世代相傳，棉延不絕。工商業百分之九十五操諸僑跑之手。如果是初次身臨其境，眞不相信，這是異國的土地。</p>
<p>戰爭結束後的年餘以來，南洋各地，或是騷亂未已，或是排華益烈，只有暹羅，情形較爲安定。隨着中暹邦交的成立，僑胞的地位，已經有了很顯着的提高和改善；就是集會，結社，出版也有了完全的自由。這羅人對於僑胞，也都另目相視，素以排華著稱的前內閣總理乃比里訪問我國，拜謁生席；許多華僑後裔，紛紛承認祖籍。暹羅敎育部長鼓勵暹校加授華文，在內地各埠，甚而至於有不少暹羅官員，遺送子女入華校求學，改用中國姓名，華僑社會間舉辦公益事業，他們往往熱烈參加，或是捐資相助。　披汶當權期間所頒佈的種種苛例，雖然尙未完全明令廢棄，但在事實上，早就無形停止施行了。</p>
<p>由於受着英暹協定的限制，遲羅的主要物產，如米糧和木材等，或是强制收買，或是禁止出口，造成經濟呆　，商業蕭條，這不僅是影響到暹羅的整個國運，同時也就是我們中國僑胞的一種最重大的打擊。</p>
<p>恐嚇勒索依法</p>
<p>華僑素有財神之構，而且人多目爲　直可欺。在日寇南進期間，由於暹羅的物產的豐饒，同時，暹羅仍舊保持着一絲自由貿息的氣息，暴發致富的滿目都是。這就給來自祖國的官員們，開了方便之門，起初是藍某，繼而是邢某和李某，他們都藉「懲治漢奸」之名，向戰時暴發致富的施行恐嚇和勒索。在戰時暴發致富的，十有九個幹過通敵，資敵，事敵的勾當，誠惶誠恐之餘，就想用錢來掩遮自身的劣跡。官員們已計得售，每人帶了近一千萬銖的暹幣和大批金條享淸福去了。在目前，這種恐嚇勒索和食汚之風依然未見稍戢，如百餘合胞的獲得釋放，花去的代個是暹幣一百萬銖，負實交涉的　得三十萬銖；假借名義而在暹羅　財的，爲數不知凡幾，　　　社，　笑海外。我國中樞當局，最近會有組織海外巡廻監察團的決議，償胞們都希望早日付於實施。</p>
<p>三多加上三多</p>
<p>「和尙多，佛寺多，女人多。」這是暹羅原有的「三多」。　後的暹羅華僑社會間又增加了「三多」：就是「僑領多，黨派多，報紙多。」這「三多」都是互有因果，相與關係的。當在日本投降的初期，一般幹過通敵，資敵，事敵的，自知罪孽深重，　是匿居不出，或是揚言死亡，避人耳目，後來藉了錢的力量，又得拋頭露面，在華僑社會間大搖大擾，嚴然以「僑領」自居，所謂「僑領」也者，他們之間，大都意見紛歧，自立門庭，野心和無恥之徒，依附相從，往往自稱屬於某「黨」，或是成爲某「派」。往往互相　詆，甚而至於互相械鬥，或是施行暗殺。所謂「僑領」和某「黨」，某「派」，因受僑胞攻擊和興論捐摘，便就自己掬荷包，創辦報紙，以做說話的工具，代替自己辯護，如張蘭臣，陳振敬，陳鏞鏘等八名，都是人所共知的著名漢奸，尤其是張關臣徵集了十多萬華僑工人，送去爲敵人建築暹緬鐵路，因受虐待和疾病死亡者，達於十萬之譜，鬼哭　號，慘絕人寰，三百餘萬僑胞，莫不欲食其肉而寢其皮，他們御用的報紙，竟稱之爲「從事地下工作抗日有功。』</p>
<p>中暹懸案未決</p>
<p>中暹邦交成立，使節蒞任，僑馳極爲　　興奮，誰都把希望寄託於李大使之一身，希望他能够爲僑飽爭一口氣。但是，大使館成立已經成立二個丹了，中暹間的許多重要懸案，尙未交涉處理。李大使忙於應酬和交際，殮舞和晚會，幾無盧夕。</p>
<p>華僑最高學府</p>
<p>三百多間華校，已經相繼復課。只是師資鈇乏，成爲一個最嚴重的問題。許多有眞才實學的知議份子，都在變披汶當權和日寇進佔暹羅期間之內，逃亡離境。因之此時凡是略知之無，而有「僑領」說項或是親友引荐者，都可濫竽充數。就如中華中學吧，這是暹羅華僑的最高學府，因爲師資缺乏和主持的不得其人，殊無成續可言。暹羅的華僑敎育，尙在等待復興，暹羅華僑的文化園地，尙在等待開墾，願祖國的敎育家，文化界人土，踴躍南進！</p>

<p>中美商約已經在十一月四日正式簽字於南京，條文已全部公布，共計三十條，另外附一個議定書，對條約中所列若干名詞，作一解釋，作爲附件。自從不平等條約取消以後，中國和工業先進友邦訂立商的，這還算是第一個，因此全國人民，注意這個商的的非常多，發表意見批評的，也不在少數，我們綜合各方意見，可以分爲毁譽兩方面：譽的方面，不外說這個條的是平等互惠的條約，我們不必多所引述，毁的方面多半說這個條約，要使中國變爲美國經濟的附庸，美國所給予中國的權利，中國將因國力的不充足，無法加以利用，而中國所給與美國的權利，美國將以其優越的國力，物力，和人力，充分的加以運用，結果便成了片面的優惠，而不是平等的互惠，有一位呌做馬其倫的先生，甚至於說『這個商約是美國大規模經濟侵略的先聲』，這種種說法，我們不敢批評他們的是非，實際上也無此必要，不過我們不能不特別說明一點，就是中國和美國在這個期間，訂立這樣一個商約，實在是各有其需要。美國需要的是什么？那便是所謂戰時工業繁榮的轉移和維持以及人民的充份就業；中國需要的是什麽？就是要把殘破的中國建設成爲富强康樂的國家，這是中國最近這幾年中必要做到的大事業，大規模的建國需要充分的物資，優良的技術，然而本來落伍而又經久戰的中國，怎樣解決建設所需的資金器材和技術問題呢？在這種需要之下，便成立了中美商的。</p>
<p>（一）第一期經建原則和中美商約</p>
<p>我們知道世界上復興國家的建設，已經有的，不外乎下列三種不同的方式：一種是土耳其式，一種是蘇聯式，一種是南美三國的方式，土耳其在第一次世界大戰以前，是一個和以前的中國一樣，被不平等條約所重重束縛，到了第一次世界大戰以後，把不平等條約取消，懾於前次的痛苦，絕對不和外國發生債務關係，兢兢業業只以本國所有的財力物力來進行國家的建設，因此土國的建設進行得非常慢，規模也非常小，在第二决世界大戰以前，土國和西方列強此起來，依然是一個落伍得很遠的國家，蘇聯在第一次世界大戰的過程中發生了共產生義的革命，後來實行五年建設計劃，用政治的力量控制全國的農產品，再把這些農產品向國外易取建國所需的機械和其他必需的物資，對於國外的技術人才是不惜重金禮聘的，至於南美三國則並不拒用國外的資金，在平等的原則下，吸收國外的資金，器材，或技術，因此他們在建國的過程中，得到事半功倍的效果。我們中國的建設，不採取取土的方式，而是採取南美三國的辦法，國父所撰的實業計劃，就是以利用外國的資金和技術做基礎的，中國八年多的抗戰，已經把國際地位提高，中國對世界和平的貢獻，也已經被美英蘇聯等友邦所充份認識，中國在戰後的復興不但是中國本身的問題，而且也是整個世界和平的一部份，尤其是美國朝野，對於這一點認識得格外淸楚，對於中國復興所遭遇的種種問題，很關切地願與必要的援助，中國爲了迎接這種時代，適應這種需要，特於三十三年十二月下旬的第一百四十八次的國防最高委員會會議中通過了第一期經濟建設的原則，這個原則一共包括七點，共中三點是說：</p>
<p>（一）中外合資事業，其外人投資數額之比例，應不加固定拘束，公司組織除董事長外，其總經理人選，亦不限爲本國人。</p>
<p>（二）經政府按照建設總計畫審核後，國營事業得由主管機關，向國外借款，或由國外投資，民營事業，亦得自行洽商，呈請主管機關核准備案。</p>
<p>（四）外人在中國直接投資，單獨經營之事業，應依照中國法令辦理，其特種事業須特許方得經營，應先呈經我國政府審核後特許之。</p>
<p>道是戰事未結束前中國自己方面的準備，中國原有的法令各公司法等和經濟建設有關係而又與上述幾個原則相抵觸的，還得要由立法院修改，以免妨碍吸引外資的進行，中國政府預先做道種工作，不過是看到國際間可能的趨勢，而先把所有障碍除去，究竟和吸收外資以從事建設的實際工作，還有一段很大的距離，因爲沒有得到友邦的實際援助，是無法實現的，中美商約可以說是中國經濟建設原則，得到美國切實援助的一個正式承認，把美國的資金，器材技術等流入中國的障碍，又去了一層，我們可以說因爲這個條約的成立，把中國吸引外資以從事大規模經濟建設的政策，又推進了一步。</p>
<p>（二）形式平等和實際意義</p>
<p>中美商的的雙方主要目的，是在解決各自的當前主要問題，而在形式上表現出來的是平等與互惠，如第二條第二款之規定，充分表現了平等的形式，就是說依照這個條款的規完，美國人可以在中國從事或經營商務，製造……等事業，中國人在美國也有這些權利，美國人在中國因爲有從事這些事業，有權利建造或租賃房屋等權利，中國人在美國也有這些權利；只是有兩點須加注意：其一，是所在國專爲其本國國民保留之職業，不在經營範圍之內的；其二，所經營的一切事業必須遵守所在國合法官廳所頒行之法規，包括將來所頒行之法規在內這種形式貫澈在全部巾美商的之內，就表面上看自然是平等的，但就實際上講，因爲美國是一個工業先進國家，中國是一個貧窮落后的國家，況又經長期戰爭的殘破之後，無論在科學·抜術·器材·資金那一方面，和美國相較，真不啻有　壤之別。因此，在中美商的巾所設定的權利和優例，一定是美國人享受得多，而我們山國人所享受到的一定是極其有限，事實上是極不平等的。這是一般批評家詬病中美商的的焦點所在，是就商的所表現的形式來立論，可以說對商的的眞正意義，是沒有澈底瞭解的。</p>
<p>我們已經說過，中國需要大規模的開發實業，尤其在經過了八年多長期抗戰的中國，眞是瘡痍滿目，百廢待舉，我們的人民除了少數發國難財和接收財的汚吏奸商以外，都已經弄到衣履不周，度日維艱的程度，人民旣然窮了，國庫當然也空虛了，何況又是久經過份負擔以後的國庫？因此，我們自己能够籌措的建設資金實在有限得很！我們再縱眼一看世界的風雲，實在不容許我們從容不迫的自己籌措資金來慢慢地開發實業。我們旣然需要大量外資，歡迎大量外資來建設我們的國家，那我們怎樣可以加以種種束縛或者把外資流入的門開得很小，進建設工廠所需要的房屋建造，土地租賃等權利都不給與呢？其他和外資流入以後的有關問題如償務之訴追，財產之保障和處分遺產之承繼，專利與商標之運用，租稅之課徵，以及僑民之兵役，管制之公平施行等，若不一一作適常之解決，對於我們吸引外資以建國的目的是多少有妨礙的。目前的中國，正像一個在大病初愈以後，需要休養的滋補，使他能夠恢復健康，以便從事工作。滋補休養期間需要若干費用，自己無法籌措，雖出於吿貸，亦屬無辦法中之辦法，只要吿貸有門，便算是有了辦法，萬不可狃於收支平衡的觀念，一定不舉可借之債，而要這個新好的病人自己勞動來開支這筆休養滋補的費用！中美商約勢將有不平等的事實發生，但是我們目的是在建設，正和新愈的病人需要舉債以進補劑一樣，是無辦法中之惟一辦法了。</p>
<p>此外，我們還得注意三點：其一，這個商約的有效期間是五年，我們知道蔣主席所著的「中國之命運」一書中，提出了五年建設計劃，這兩個年期並不是不謀而合的；其二，這個商的中對於礦產資源之探勘及開發權利，彼此尙持保留態度，只規定給與『任何第三國國民，法人或團體時，則此項權利，亦應依照依法組成之官廳現在或將來所施行之有關法律規章）倘有此項法律規章時）的束彼方之國民，法人或團體』，這裏可以看到國家對於鑛達開發權之吸引外資是如何的愼重！其三，商的中每涉及一項權利時，必說明『應依照依法組成之官廳現在或將來所施行之有關法律規章』字樣，這便是說如果吸引外資發生流弊，儘可用法律規章來補救，具有防患於未然的作用，可以說是很周到的。</p>
<p>（三）結論</p>
<p>總之，中美商約成立的甚點，中國是爲了要進行建國大業，而美國是爲了過剩的資金和物資謀出路，而各自的目的都是在紙的背面，表現出來的却是平等互惠的一套，因此，我們的學者批評家，都對準了未來不平等事實的產生做立論的根據，遂致誤會滋生，歧之又歧了；如果我們站在建設的觀點來看這個條約的意義所在，再把條約中的關鏈所在看明白了以後，便可以知道這個條約對我們國家的前途是有利益的。</p>
<p>五年的期問是很容易過去的，試看日本投降到現在，不是已經一年多了嗎？這一年多的時聞裏，我們國家對於建國大業的基礎奠定了什麼，截止現在爲止，其成就還是很少，中美商約的成立，只是建國廣火範圍中的一部份，另外還有一部份更重要的基礎，就是建國環境的造成，到現在還沒有頭緒，如果這情形繼續下去，那末商約雖然已經成立，但是建國的進行，依然困難，而商的訂立的本意，勢將無從實現，這纔是最可怕的事！</p>
<h3>西子湖在寒風裏</h3>
<p>— 十一月卅日杭州訊　本報杭州特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>初冬，西子湖打了一個寒戰，以後又是滿天溫暖的太陽；湖上的枝葉雖然在褪色，但在湖濱遙望，還是相當蒼鬱繁茂。時已仲冬，西子湖看不出凋零之色，只是杭州的報紙上，一篇篇闢欄的文章，競道着枯寂的隆冬。有心人正爲這溫暖的天候躭心着明年的稻作收成，又躭心着假使天候驟然冷起來，這許多窮困無吿的人將如何活下去？</p>
<p>一夜尖說的西北風，把新市塲馬路兩旁的法國梧桐吹秃了頂；湖濱，蘇堤，白堤上鋪滿了殘枝敗葉，雖然淸道夫掃了又　，但一轉眼　　又散滿在路上。遙望湖中，蒼鬱繁茂的樹林已變得枯黃衰老了。</p>
<p>來了冬天閒了划子</p>
<p>這　條約冬天，　子　裏的划子，拆去了布蓬，懶洋洋地躺在湖　，船家沒有什麽事做，等待着嚴塞過去，好在明春，活躍一番。他們一共有八百多人，有船五百多隻，　划子生活的，連家屬在內一共有四千人左右，許多船伕都是向人租船來划駛的，和船主人概四六分拆所得的船資，市政府規定二千元划一小時，但在西北風呌嘯的冬天裏，即使船資　到二百元一小時，恐怕也無人顧間。他們一家大小，全憑春夏秋三季收入的積蓄，來度過，這嚴酷的寒冬，有些人沒有積蓄的，又只能出諸於向高利貸者貸款的一途了。這許多閒散的人力，年老年幼的不算，年輕力壯的很多很多，怎樣使他們不致將有用的光陰浪費呢？</p>
<p>冬令救濟　響徹雲霄</p>
<p>在這裏，冬令救濟的呌喊聲響徹了雲霄，但在湖濱鬧市一帶的人行道上，入晚就有很多人憑着一條蘆蓆庵　是一些破棉絮，裏着身子蜷縮在廊沿下。這些人，有的似已到了花甲的高年，有的似在受國民敎育的時代。浙江日報上載着在橫河橋畔，一個老的和兩個小的都因沒有飯吃而餓死，像這樣的情形想必一定還會有。</p>
<p>收容苦兒　原額未足</p>
<p>行總浙江分署和浙省救濟院合辦的失依兒童教養所，到處貼着長達千言的吿失依兒童書，聽說自十一月一日成立以來，已先後收容一百二十三各，還不足原定二百名的額子，然而，在街上儘多衣衫襤褸的兒童。這裏勾引起我一個可怕的回憶，就是戰時在貴陽也辦有流浪兒童收容所，但是收容來以後，他把衣服被枕都偸跑到外邊去了，變價賣去後，仍舊在街頭流浪。環境已經敎育他流浪的生活，他已不慣規範，頑劣成性，這當然是社會環境的責任，但主持失依兒童敎養所的人不可不引爲前車之鑑。</p>
<p>平價食堂　門可羅雀</p>
<p>又一救濟性質的機構，便是行總浙江分署與靑年團杭州區國合辦的平價食堂。這個食堂已辦了三個月，每客兩百元，可得一杯牛奶，一盆牛肉，三個饅頭，一碗湯。第一個月生意興隆，肩摩踵接，第二個月下旬，牛肉沒有了，改成菠菜豆粉，吃客漸漸少了，第三個月，已是門可羅雀了。是不够便宜嗎？是距離平民窟太遠嗎？是沒有牛肉的關係嗎？是饅頭的麵粉不好嗎？是牛奶太淡了嗎？是中國人，吃不　嗎？這似乎都値得主辦者縝密的硏討。否則平價食堂是有了，救濟的意義却沒有完盡啊！</p>
<p>切實賑濟　認真調查</p>
<p>浙江分屬的冬賑計劃中有發舊衣二千包，另製棉衣兩萬件賑放。浙省也成立了，冬令救濟委員會勸募棉衣，被，米，榖，雜糧等來賑放給無吿的貧民。對於這種義舉，當然値得讚　不已，但是怎樣放賑到眞正的貧民身上，却是一個當前的問題，在我們不注意統計的國家裏，人口的精確數至今還在調査中，就州到底有多少貧民？要多少米，榖，棉衣，棉被才能恰到好處？不致浪費？不致粥少僧多？我以爲這時候就該調査，但調査要快，賑濟也要快，賑濟事業原本不同衙門中辨公事。但爲求迅速而胡亂賑放，却又失了眞正賑濟的目的。我主張事前必須調查，始可爲今後辦救濟事業的一種張本。而且調查以後，到明年此時再調查時，就可衡量出救濟事業的進步與吾了。</p>
<p>有用之年無法施展近月來，湖濱和鬧市站在馬路邊賣笑的姑娘少了，杭州各報上有兩種的說法，一種說天漸漸冷了，她們不耐這湖面襲來的寒風，所以漸漸地絕跡了；一種說市警察局把她們驅定了，她們現在到拱宸橋去繁興市面了。依事實看來，　者的說法似較準確。這羣可憐的姑娘，大半都是在無辦法中才出賣她的皮肉的。她們之間，最大的有四十歲模樣，最小的有十三四歲尙未發育健全的女孩，在敎育的立塲講，應該都是有用之年，市警局把她們在市區內趕跑了，但她們爲了在有用之年而無法使用，還不是去做她們所不顧意的勾當。那麽市區內雖然暫時沒有了她們的蹤跡，而別的地方還是一樣的賣笑着呢？在這嚴　的冬天，她們立在尖利的朔風裏，接不到客回去挨打，接到了僅够自已的溫飽，這些人原應該救濟的，那麽在冬令教濟聲中，爲什麼沒有人計劃一下，把這許多有佣之年的女同胞眞正的貢獻她們的能力呢？</p>
<p>城隍山頭相士末路城隍山是抗州的名勝之一，這幾天山上的相士們也關起門來過年了。他們憑着自己的聰明與一些已受的敎育，在沒辦法中，才做這看相算命的事的。他們在山上，靠着春夏秋三季遊客的光顧，積蓄一些錢度過這嚴冬。勝利以後，由於國內普遍的失業現象，使山上的相士增加了不少，由於相士的加多，所以也賺不了多少錢。今冬當也是頗費躊躇了。這許多相士中，年老的果然是有，但年靑的也佔着一個多數，這多數的年靑人如何使他們不浪費在「閒聊天」的歲月中，當也値得政府和救濟當局的考慮吧！</p>
<p>冬天來了，西子湖的遊客少了，除非在大雪天，特別有豪興的人，來看看西子的淡裝。</p>

<h3>福特公司的特色</h3>
<p>— 任衡亮</p>
<p>（一）福特的人生觀</p>
<p>（一）做事業州家不做資本家：福特說「我是事業家，不是資本家」。我雖然有着難以估計的財產，但是我並不想把他佔爲私有，或把他藏起來。我僅是這些財產的一個合法保護人而已。假定說有一個合理的保管委員會，我立刻就願把這些財產交出去。我的財產是完全放在工廠內活用，以資生產貨物，來養活工人。有盈餘，則設法擴充事業。總之我的人生觀是造福人羣，使人人有工做，人人有飯吃而已。」</p>
<p>（二）以給工作人做來代替慈善：社會上多着犧牲了千萬人的幸福，囊括了千萬萬的家財，再以所有財產的萬分之一，來購買一個慈善家的假面具，福特則不然，他並不想做假惺惺的慈善家，他的口號是「以給工作人做來代替慈善」，他以爲一個人的受人救濟，有傷他本身的尊嚴，世界上都認爲應予救濟的拐脚騰子之類殘廢者，福特都能給一些簡單的工作他做，因爲瞎子，他的手足都健全的存在着，拐脚也侭可坐着工作，所以他的工廠內，有着許多殘廢的工人，他的人生觀是同樣是人，不應該給予一些些微的救濟就算了事，應該給予適當的工作，使他們自食其力，生活安定，那才是人類最高同情心的表現。</p>
<p>（二）福特公司內部特點</p>
<p>（一）八小時的工作制度，一般資本家都把勞力看作商品一般，他們以爲工資是勞力的代價，好像以金錢購買商品一樣，所以金錢力求其少，勞力力求其多，把一個人的工作時間，延長到十二小時或十三小時，他們便以爲是塌到了一個大便宜，其實他們沒有考慮到過分的延畏工作時間，對於工廠本身將發生怎樣的一個不良後果，一個人的精力，當然也有其限度，而工作時間之外，當然也應有其活動的範圍，例如汰衣服，洗澡，以及得到一些精神食糧之類，如此則方能恢復其工作的疲勞，方能得到一些家庭間的樂趣，若一日之間，工作十數小時，對於個人生活的枯燥，固無庸待言，而對於工作方法，因精力不及，當然也會發生種種流弊，粗製濫造，乃意料中事，所以過分冗長的工作時間，對於工廠本身，有莫大之不利，這不能不佩服福特的深謀遠慮，自願來實行破天荒的三八工作制。</p>
<p>（二）工資提高：福特工廠的工人，福特都給予全家最低生活費的工資，當福特將此種工資突然提高及此項標準時，差不多高出其他廠家一倍多，成千成萬的工人都想到福特工廠去做工，福特以爲，一個工人假使要使他安心工作，就非要給予足以維持全家最低限度的生活費用不可，否則，一面做工，一面在擔憂着家中的柴米，這種不合理的現像，直接影響着工作效率與出品，也足以影響工廠前途的榮祐，福特是有鑒及此的，所以他必須先要安定工人的生活，使他們能够安心工作，把工作做得最好最快，視工廠好像自己的家庭一樣。</p>
<p>（三）科學管理法：當福特實行八小時工作制和把工資提高之後，一般同業的資本家都從旁竊笑，他們以爲縮短工作時間，和提高工資，無疑是將成本提高，這種自扼咽喉的辦法，他們都取笑福特廠在三個月內就可化爲一個水泡，但事實證明其不然，福特在實行此種辦法之後，反而賺了更多的錢，福特是有辦法的，因爲福特澈底實行了科學管理法，工作時間雖僅八小時，但八小時內工人們都全神貫注着工作，所以八小時工作的效率竟超越了他廠十二小時工作的效率，又因爲他的工廠內是分工合作制度，每一個工人僅須專做一種零件，因爲工作簡單，所以格外容易熟練，一個人一天的工作，簡直可以抵得他廠二天的工作，所以工資雖大，時閱雖短，但工作效率，遠非他廠所可企及，因此成本反較他廠爲低，在不明內容的人看來，莫不認爲是一個大大的奇績。</p>
<p>（三）福特公司對外特點</p>
<p>（一）多賺了要還本：有一年，福特廠賺了超過應得的利潤，於是福特在股東會議提出，按照賣出的車輛數，把多餘的利潤，平均攤派，還給每一個福特汽車的主顧，這一個提議，當然遭到其他股東極端的反對，因爲自有商業以來，勾心鬥角，唯利是圖：利潤所謂越多越好，決無將已經瞭到的錢，反去還給顧客的理由，福特則以爲不然，他以爲人生以服務爲目的，做工廠的固然應該把貨品做得頂好，還不能取非法的暴利，假使大家把利潤加得很多，一方面固然直接影響顧客的購買力，一方面竟可說對於顧客含有欺騙行爲，在這種種理由之下，福特竟毅然將此項非法利潤，還了顧客，雖然他爲了此事和少數唯利是國的股東拆了夥，但從此在許多顧客的心理上，種下了一個不可磨滅的好形像，他們都以爲福特眞是一個忠實的爲社會服務者，於是營業竟格外發達起來，他的主張就是「薄利多賣」。</p>
<p>（二）應付暴風雨的來臨：第一次歐戰之後，美國也閙經濟恐慌，市面一蹶不振，工商一片不景氣聲，尤其福特廠，負債累累，報上登戰載着福特廠要破產的預測，銀行家想動腦筋借錢給福特、以取得很高的利率，這種銀行家目願肯借錢給福特的舉動，在他人恐怕眞是求之不得，但福特則自有他深遠的見解，他以爲假使向銀行家借了這些高利貸款，這些利率無疑是要加到成本上去，成本一大，售價勢必也要增加，售價一高，消費量就要减少，這樣循環下去，簡直就是一條絕路，所以他毅然將銀行家肯借錢给他的事，率直拒絕了，於是福特就運用他偉大的魄力，第一步將公司內的存貨，廠價出售，这樣一來，竟償淸了大部分債務，週轉也就靈活起來，第二步他把事務部的大部分人，調到工塲內去參加直接生產工作，這樣一來，福特竟渡過了這個難關，有人估計，假使福特在不景氣暴風雨來襲之時，向某銀行借了債務，將形成一個汽車售價很高，生意很淸的悲慘局面，說不定早已倒閉，可見福特的深謀卓見，是很可佩服的。</p>
<p>以上不過福特工廠的一些槪略，我國實業家中，與福特氏類似者，惟前次被綁出險的棉紗大王榮德生氏，差可比擬，福特的特點，其實是一般實業家都該師法的。</p>

<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>雇工訓練與職業保障</p>
<p>關於雇用職工，可以用心理學來做根據，實行測騐，已經在前面討論過了，現在我們要討論的是關於雇用職工方面的其他問題：</p>
<p>（一）女工的訓練</p>
<p>我們曾經說起過女工的長處和短處，以及定奪雇用男工還是女工的標準，現在要把女工的訓練方面，加以討論，普通男工，因爲已經做過工人，或者事實上不能去做別種用腦力的工作，祇有做用體力的工人，因此他們對於工廠的認識，比女工來得更深一點，所以女工所需要的訓練，往往比男工爲多。</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰的時候，各種工廠裏面，都設立一所附屬的學校。道學校就是走進工廠之前的必經之路。無論男工或女工，在未曾正式加入工廠之前，一定先要在那學校裏實行訓練，到了相當時候方能正式雇用，這種學校，往往是在工廠裏另關一個地方，裝置着與製造時所用的同等的機器，使未來的工人可以在那裏學習，由專門的技師，祖任敎授，這一種工作的實行，有下列幾點利益：</p>
<p>一，女工們最初加入工廠做工，因爲環境的轉變，往往要手足無措，非常膽胠，這種情形，對於製造工作的進行上，是很不相宜的。在經過訓練以後，就可以使她們去除這種心理。</p>
<p>二，在製造廠裏，做壞了貨品，就是一種損失，大槪做壞貨品？一方面是由於疏忽，一方面是因爲缺少訓練，所以經過訓練之後，就可以减少將來的損失，因此在未曾雇用以前，做一點訓練工作，是很値得的。</p>
<p>三，做成一件貨品，需要好幾個步驟，每一個步驟之間，終要彼此合作。這一點如果經過訓練之後，就可以使工人的工作程度合乎一定的標準，那末彼此間的通力合作問題，也可以解決了。</p>
<p>以前上海電話公司，在福建路分局裏，設有一所學校，專門訓練對於電話方面的專門人才。參加者在朱進學校之前，要實行考試，等到在學校裏訓陳了相當時期，認爲合格的時候，就派到公司裏去服務，凡是一般屬於專門性的貨品的製造廠，而且規模相當大，這種訓練是很有益的。</p>
<h3>工廠中應用的顔色</h3>
<p>— 林漢明</p>
<p>工業用顏色在學理上最近發展很多，吾人對此欲作一簡單說明，最好先談談工業顏色用法的一些基本問題。日光光譜中的顏色是盡人皆熟悉的，它由深紫色慢慢的，一個一個波長的變至深紅色。但工業上主要的着色很少利用光譜中單純的顏色，通常以利用外表及效應諸多不同的溫或淡灰色居多。祇是在加重或要求注意時利用單色外，其他地方是用得很少的。</p>
<p>說顏色是一種感覺比說它是一種物質的性質來得好，同樣的顏色的感覺在不同的狀態下可能截然不同。例如一張藍色的紙下面襯以黑色底與綠色底所表現的結果就有很大的差別。同樣，顏色還可以影響其他性質的感覺，最顯著的是大小的觀念，一個白圓似乎比一個同樣直徑的黑回來得大，一灰色圓的大小又似乎介於此二者之間。有些顏色可以使一物體先行顯示出來，另外一些顏色又可以使物體隱到黑暗的地方去。更有一些顏色能够產生溫暖的效應，黃色，桃紅色，紅色便是；另外一些顏色如藍色，綠色與戶外顏色相似，產生冷的效應。</p>
<p>此外尙有心理學上的因素，例如，紅色是光譜中有名的最有力的顏色，它與力量，動作結合具有對人類的性情的絕大影響的作用。黃色是燦爛的及愉快的，綠色是冰冷的及具有令人重振精神的力量，但它旣不令人興奮亦不令人懊喪。它或者且所有顏色中最爲人所鍾意的。</p>
<p>在產業上利用顏色，最主要的是機器顏色的選擇。此項選擇之範圍甚廣，並不祇很於單一的顏色。機器的顏色需有一適當高的反光能力，隨時使環境的光度與工作下之光度大槪一致。機器的表面應成半磨光狀態，俾其在實用上將强光及閃光的强度减至最低値。</p>
<p>在某些工作中，使工具在光亮的背景下呈半黑影色，則工作極爲便利。半黑影色亦可有效的用作一反射背景以調節工作時環境的光度。將光綫均匀的反射在游標及工作綫上的反射面等亦應漆以半黑影色。</p>
<p>加重的顏色係純顏色中的一小部分而適用於機器着色上者，普通利用它的目的有二，一爲表明危險的地方，動作槓桿及撳杻等。二爲使一塊光亮的地方增加美觀而作爲裝飾的作用。</p>
<p>廠房的顔色</p>
<p>在大工廠的廠房中很少利用一單純一種顏色；相鄰的廠房的顏一色突然的改變亦常避免，而改用相關連的顏色。由經騐證明，在工廠巾要做到第一等的顏色工作，有三個主要的步驟：第一，設備須有次序的排列，混雜的東西必須移去，盡可能放置於另一分離的室內。凡易於促使廠房紊亂的東西必須小心安放妥當。第二，供給適當的照明，一個工廠內部若不能正確的排列好，絕不可能達到美觀，若光不適當亦不可能使工廠成爲一個有效率可講的工廠。刷以適當的顏色對良好的照明是十分重要的，（但很少粉刷能够克服由眩目的燈光直接在工作者的環境中所生成的妨礙。第三，便是選擇適當的顏色，此點係根據前面所述的原理。</p>
<p>總之，在工業的範疇裏，有計劃的刷以適當顏色，這種觀念並不是新近才發現的；由於其許許多多的好處，相信在最近的將來，它的應用將更廣大。</p>

<h3>記達夫先生</h3>
<p>— 耶草</p>
<p>二十四年深秋，幾個朋友相約伴遊西湖，在杭州一邊遊山玩水，一邊和朋友飲酒談天，一住便是半月。這半月中，和達夫先生前後見過三次。不料這幾次竟是最後的會見，十年易度，達夫先生的聲容笑貌尙留在我的腦際，但他却已殉身海外，眞令人不勝悽愴之感！</p>
<p>一天早晨，我們找到了詩人王一心先生，一心是我老同學，那天在一家濱湖的菜館裏，他呌了許多菜，並且吃醉蟹，喝達年花彫。下午，一心沒上班，我也沒參加遊湖，傍晚，和一心同去看達夫先生。他留我們吃晚飯，又喝了許多好酒。</p>
<p>席間郁夫人王映霞女士吿訴我們，他們搬到杭州，主要的是爲孩子們讀書方便，而且，湖邊空氣好，生活低，宜於達夫先生的寫作和健康。</p>
<p>「你們如果要喝好酒，」郁先生從容的道：「可常到我家來。朋友們送我的儘是好酒，足够喝些時候。還有，我吿訴你們，如果你們到紹興，除非到了歡喜吃酒的人家，在市面很難我到好酒的。」</p>
<p>達夫先生酒量相當好，酒興尤其好。且飲且談，毫無倦容。</p>
<p>「達夫這個幾年身體不好，」王映霞女士插嘴說：「我屢决勸他少吃；現在，他吃的决數比較少，每次吃的酒也漸漸少了。」</p>
<p>郁先生笑而不言。</p>
<p>我們繼續談着，郁先生的談鋒甚健；關於創作手法和五四以後我國幾部較好的文藝作品等問題，確有獨到之處。他轉過臉來笑着對我說：</p>
<p>「一心是一位藝術氣質最重的詩人，愛酒，愛月亮，愛西湖；假如有一天禁了酒，或是有一個人根本不准他吃，那個時候，我想他的詩源恐怕就要枯竭了！」</p>
<p>從郁先生那裏，我得知一心很歡喜獨酌，每於月白風淸之夜，買舟沽酒，在湖心獨自飲一個痛快，然後便有好詩創作出來。</p>
<p>飯後又談了些瑣事，一心請他批評我的文章，郁先生謙遜地</p>
<p>「身體好的人，比較有魄力；可以多寫寫長篇。……」</p>
<p>他那誠懇的態度，熱烈的語氣，至今還深深的印在我的腦裏。</p>
<p>第三天，一個機關在湖濱的那個呌「明湖應」（？）的大禮堂內，招待來杭的某一個文化團體，我們也被邀參加，和達夫先生坐在一起。那廳裏有一付郁先生自撰自書的虎皮宜的對聯，縣在中間，非常出色，文字現在已經記不淸了。</p>
<p>那時政府正在加緊倡導新生活運動，應裏是沒人抽烟的。郁先生却從長衫口袋裏取出一包克雷斯列，順手遞給我一支，我接過來，向他笑了一笑，他會意的說：</p>
<p>「儘管抽吧，不要緊……」</p>
<p>全處只有我們兩個人抽烟，那些被招待的人向我們可望着，使人有點不好意思，達夫先生的神情却異常的安閒。</p>
<p>後來一心對我說，達夫先生是以一個名流的身份居住杭垣，獲得不少的便利和優待。</p>
<p>我們離杭的前一天，到他府上去辭行，適巧他應酬去了。當我們走的那天，在杭州車站上，無意過見了達夫先生和他的夫人。他說他送夫人上火車，到上海去，代他領取版稅。他個人不久也許到上海來玩，大家可以見面。</p>
<p>次年，他寫了不少遊記，幾乎篇篇皆是佳構。聽說他那時在浙皖贛三省邊區新間的公路上，曾經作過一個時期的旅行。</p>
<p>又過些時候，聽說他到福建省政府去，担任一個參議的名義。直到八一三事變發生，我們沒有通過一次信。</p>
<p>三十年，接到朋友的信，略微提起他的家庭事變，我當時不大相信，認爲一定是謠傳。</p>
<p>在西安，三十二年春天，我和謝冰瑩先生合編一個刊物，曾託幾個朋友向他拉稿，朋友回信都說早已失去聯絡，不詳他的地點！勝利後我們回到上海，多方探詢，才曉得郁先生確已在海外殉難。</p>
<p>達夫先生晚年遭逢家庭事變，已經够不幸的了；自身又繼之以慘死，凡是敬愛他的，其傷痛哀悼是筆墨所可形容的嗎！</p>
<h3>世界震盪中的文藝思潮</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>現在呈現在我們眼前的，並不是家族思想，黨派觀念，甚至並不是國家問題，民族關係，毫無疑義，是整個的世界問題！科學工業發達，把世界縮小到舉足輕重，非但電！交通的迅速，飛機往還的便利，即就原子彈而言，已把國家的界限，毁滅無餘！</p>
<p>蕭伯納與愛因斯坦，他們都感到世界若再有戰爭，文化必壽於消滅！因爲在這小小的地球上，若運用宇宙中的原子力來摧毁，整個世界可以立刻同歸於盡！所以世界到了今日，不必再分別什麽界限，也不必再各自爲我。那種離開了人類羣衆的利益，抱着統制世界的野心，想蹂躪其他的民族的國家，實在愚蠢而可憐。</p>
<p>現在急需的，世界要聯合一體，不可浪費人類才智，去做毁滅世界的工作。一方面陳舊古老的舊社會，也不能容許它繼續的存在，一方面要使大家都有好飯吃，每個人都負了改造世界的責任，誰也不能外世界而生存！</p>
<p>害人就是害已，不用說的，人我分割不開，好像身體裏細胞，有一部分腐爛，影響及於全體的安危；現在不是思想問題，也不是哲學問題，是事實問題。等於家庭兄弟不和，爲了爭父親遺產，大家閙個不休，到氣憤時，拿了大炸彈爆發起來，意在毁滅別人，而不知同歸於盡。</p>
<p>所以我們要呼籲，要求救，文藝界的朋友，都有先知之明，感覺更比別人靈敏，更不可自立門戶，互相輕視，果然大家以博愛爲心，則氣量能容納滄海，大家都比我好，這是一件喜歡事，人人皆不如我，我更要負責。整個世界，要人類大家來支撑！文藝家是在挽救人類不幸的命運。在我們眼前的，是整個的世界問題！風雨同舟，危如累卵，世界倘不在人道正義的立塲上聯合起來，不久必爲原子彈或更進步的兇器所毁滅，那時名山也不能寳藏傑作，佛洞也不能流芳千古！</p>
<h3>月下禱聲</h3>
<p>— 法國G．Faure著　嚴大椿譯</p>
<p>作者是當代的詩人兼散文家。曾在阿耳及利住過多年，深入阿刺伯部落。他寫過許多小說，大都描寫非洲人的風俗性格，和當地的景色。——譯者附註</p>
<p>天非常淸凈，一片藍色。在發光的遠處，每天，太陽依了他無盡的運轉，把光輝投在乾渴的麥上。陽光熱煞，簡直如撲滅不掉的火災。地上沒有「滴露珠，在　乾涸的胸脯裏，種仔得不到一點兒生命中所需的濕潤。壯嚴的蒼穹又晴了一星期，他底無玷的顏色，牽來了饑餓和痛苦的結局，快將溶掉這個謨哈默德民族，猶如阿塔拉司的禿駕撲在腐臭的屍體上。</p>
<p>難道那些信徒的神明願讓他鍾愛的子孫滅亡嗎？難道他聽任大人和小孩，無血色而畏葸的人們，跑到羅米司門口去討一口麵包，使他們再苟延一天麼？</p>
<p>需要祈禱啊！</p>
<p>在喃喃的夜裏，萬千的星點散佈在空中，好像撒了一把金百合花，尖狹的新月突然出現在廣表的黑幕上。新月照射出一道乳色的光輝，並不刺眼。她底光優柔地包圍着靜睡的原野，並且把各種東西的脚上繪出長影，慢慢地移動，彷彿鐘表面上的鋼針。</p>
<p>驀地裏，沉默打破了了；一片鬧聲從村中傳來。是那些黑人，穿着白衣服，排着隊，一邊行走，一邊笨拙地舞蹈，向暖和而矇矓的微風投送單調的喉音的願辭。他們的步子徐緩，依着鈍濁的銅鼓和響朗的拍板混合的熱情的音節而搬動。羣衆聚集在他們的後面，用着痛苦的鏡聲複念那最後一句哀求的音樂。在那些不屋前，婦女們穿節日的衣服，不時，把她們底尖聲音蓋住了經過身傍的歌聲和閙樂。孩子們跟在儀仗的側面，少女們戴着金帽或銅帽，圍着絲綫和銀綫縛的闊腰帶，穿上燦爛悅目的紗裙，在這悲鳴的人潮裏找尋心愛的少年。</p>
<p>那些興奮的黑人老是前進，不斷的小跳着，他們的哀歌，聲音越唱越啞。他們前進着，谷人底眼睛，注視一鈎銀月，彷彿被一種看不見的吸力吸引住了。其時，月亮輕移運步，壯重地昇在閃爍的華美的繁星之間。在黑人們的瘦削而且縐縮的頭上，汗水如苦淚，注在他們底深陷的太陽穴上，他們底濃髮也濕了。一張野獸的口吻摺起巨唇，露出象牙色的巨齒。他們出神地凝視着。他們時時停步，搆成圓圈，擺舞更加熱烈更加急速地開始起來。歌聲加倍的粗糙，非常沙啞。銅鼓和拍板的音調可怕地爆響着，統御着這種地獄裏似的樂音。婦女們的尖呌，閃光似地插入淸凈的深夜裏。</p>
<p>在半明半暗的矮屋裏，那些半裸的老婦，跪在爆響的炭火前，配製婦藥，燒着香料，空氣裏飽含樹脂和女米迪香的香霧。她們生得枯瘦，低俯在神聖的火上，用着顫抖尖銳的聲音低念通神的話。尖細的手指下面攪拌着甘松香和藿香，玫瑰和香木。她們不時伸直了被年歲被長久的疲勞消磨殆盡的半身像，手臂舒展，握緊拳頭，頭朝後仰，頭髮蓬鬆，在忘我的境界中，在四肢挺伸的狀態下，她們呼號出幾聲魔鬼似的詛咒。</p>
<p>夜不理會那些熱烈的祈禱，嚴重盛大地流過去。現在，月兒正向深淵裏降落，要到明夜再從那裏昇起。她的角觸碰着壟斷天邊的山頭。一分鐘後，荒漠的天漸漸地朝着地面壓下一張鑲着銀邊的黑布，好如鋪盡追思臺的樣子。</p>
<p>黑人的歌不再像歌了，他們呼號着，呌喊着，喘息着。萎蘼的長臂祗是笨拙地擊鼓，擊得又快又不自然。他們底縐縮的臉孔上現出極度的激昂，眼睛奕奕，好像野獸的眼睛。他們用力頓足，被一種過信和對於神明的虔誠所托持。他們所有的能力，所有的願望，整個靈魂，全副皮肉，完全歸到超人的祈願上去。</p>
<p>忽然，正當月兒在山坡隱沒時，在平原裏吹起一陣大風，悲鳴着，寒戰着。同時，大塊的黑雲塗在天空。厚密的烏雲慢慢地推上的當兒，繁星漸滅。夜愈來愈深沉了。男子的歌聲，婦女的呌喊，雷鳴般的銅鼓越敲越響。在那些矮屋裏，曲背的老婦們伸直無肉的裸體，拂着醜陋的皮膚，摺好寬鬆了的已經是扁平的長胸衣。從前，當她們年輕幸福的時期，正是她們　倣自尊，生命富饒的時代，曾將一大把一大把的神秘的香料，投在熾盛的炭火上。而如今，她們只好在失　的夢境中，大聲念　　辭。</p>
<p>溫暖而如　般的大雨點降在乾渴的地上，電光閃　，遠處的天邊照得雪亮，雷遠遠地發出威嚴的吼聲。暴風雨壯麗地驚人地起來了。這時，全體羣衆產生了一種幸福而感恩的情緒，他們戰　戰兢兢地跪下去，額角叩着潮濕的地面，感謝神明沒有蔑視他們的祈禱。</p>
<p>「只有耶辣是神明，謨哈默裕是我們的耶辣！」</p>
<h3>吹簫人</h3>
<p>— 蘇鴻烈</p>
<p>不知從那一天起，隨着寂寞黃昏的步子，吹簫人又懷着他心愛的細小的洞簫，嗚嗚地又奏起那悽凉悲怨的簫聲。</p>
<p>我推窗俯望，那深邃的眸子，蒼白的歡，他永遠地默默　　遠方，似有所思，孤獨地蹂　於這星月之夜。</p>
<p>他，不知在何年何月，從　　方法派到這陌生的地方。</p>
<p>他永遠得不到一點人間的溫暖，唯有借着這幽暗的月色，用那細弱蒼白的手指，輕輕地按出一支悲怨的曲子。</p>
<p>他，每夜依凭着頒牆，也許這想重拾起昔日的舊夢呢？然而事實所告訴他的，又是一個怎樣凄苦的回憶。——人情薄如紙。</p>
<p>於是吹簫的人便又開始幽幽　地毁泣了，那枯槁的長髮下，蒼白的臉上，汎濫着如潮的淚水，他漸漸地使我由凝視而顫慄。</p>
<p>蒼白的霜，盡滿了他的頭髮。寒冷的風，猛撲着他單薄的衣裳。</p>
<p>漸漸地，他開始顫抖了，他瑟縮着身子，隨着的已不再是凄凉悲怨的簫聲，而漸漸地開始鳴咽了。</p>
<h3>寫在茅愛立獨唱會前</h3>
<p>— 淡水</p>
<p>前年冬天，茅愛立女士在上海舉行音樂會後，就打算往內地去，臨行時，她在那决話別會上，送給我們每個朋友一本音樂節目的小册子，上面簽有上下款的姓名，肖僕和歌詞，我拿到手，就跟她開玩笑說：「眞是好禮物，一卷在手，就「音容宛在一了。」她笑，沒有出氣，却送來一個「白眼」。</p>
<p>自她去重慶後，大家也沒有通過一封信，可是，我倒有點關懷她的近况和歌喉；之後從報章上，得知她在成都，昆明，重慶已開過好幾决音樂會，很受歡迎；一個朋友吿訴我，她還在重大靑木關國立音樂院，祖任聲樂方面的課程，燕大音樂系特地又給了她一張文憑，（有點榮譽意味的，因她祗將三年半的主修學分讀過。）</p>
<p>愛立雖遠離此地整整二年，可是她在我們的記憶裏，她的歌喉，尤其她唱的中國歌，是那樣充溢着豐富的情感，她哀怨的眼睛，幌現在前面，使我們感到了永仳的惆悵……二年後的今天，雖然略見淸减，雖然她沒有爲我們唱一個字，雖然她用微笑來代替一切言語，她是這樣常愛沉默着，然而却不願對生命作永久的沉默……最近，她在舉行這一次臨別獨唱會後，就要出國求深造了，我們除了哀心寄以熱望外，希望她在闊別後的歌唱裏，讓我們的心靈，隨着她的餘音又進入了一次夢幻的境地，叢林中靜靜的溪流，晴朗美麗的高空，……在那裏她將會給我們無限低徊的韻味。</p>

<h3>文壇趣屑</h3>
<p>— 詹翁</p>
<p>況惹風</p>
<p>況惹風先生，名士風流，傳播人口，晚年寓蘇，猶有徵歌選色之好。一日，吳瞿安宴之於城中飯店，召一妓，貌頗不揚，而董風驚爲天人，與瞿安聯句安爲贈，座客或笑之，惹風曰，此妹乃濁中淸，非俗眼所能喻也。</p>
<p>惹風捧梅蘭芳，無微不至，嘗詣後台，觀蘭芳化裝，凝神靜對，饒態可掬。退而語人曰，爲梅郞扮戲者，乃一俗不可耐之傖夫，以粗蠶雙掌，調粉傅脂，撫摩梅郞兩頓，梅郞任其撫弄，不露微瞋。不謂傖夫，享此艷福，眞令人有「願作傖夫不羡仙」之感矣！</p>
<p>梁任公先生嘗爲余書扇，珍藏有年，未嘗乞人作畫。偶於某處見朱彊邨先生畫梅，雖屬遊戲之筆，彌覺物稀爲貴，因請於先生，竟邀俯允。越日畫梅一枝，古拙可喜。惟不題一字，僅鈐一章而已。嗣謁先生，問其不肯題款之故。先生曰：向薄任公爲人，不願爲配耳。惹風先生聞其事，語余曰，以任公書　，而配以疆邨畫，何異韓非與老子同傳，君誠惡作劇矣。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　110</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>那一羣人，好像吃了一驚似的，不的而同，都回過頭來。</p>
<p>「啊……！」那和服老人，大槪就是萍子口裏的井上，又像嘆息，又像歡呼的「啊」了這一聲，一面跑一而說，「在這裏…在這裏哩！」聲音蒼老，雖然有些顫抖，却極其洪亮。</p>
<p>這裏當時起了一陣騷動；萍子聰了老人的話，雖然顰着眉尖，臉上却藏不住露出了喜容，同時把身子挨近了鶴見，反而着實地往後面一靠，坐得舒舒服服地，恰像專等着開車似的。那個單吊一隻眼鏡的紳士，相反地，却把坐得很舒服的身體，抬了起來，雙手懋在前排的椅背上，向來的這羣人，一個一個，從老人起，直看到兩個隨員。那來的一羣人，都隨在老人身後，向萍子這部車子跑了過來。</p>
<p>「留神！」單眼睛紳士向自己的人，用德語下了警吿。</p>
<p>「又是沙登君啊！」老人從車窗外探進頭來，帶着一半奇怪，一半滑稽的神情，瞧着那個單限鏡紳士，瞇着眼睛，又像笑又像哭似的，「我又得麻煩尊駕下車來，同老朽談兩句話，閣下肯賣這個面子嗎？……哦！」老人順眼掠過萍子，看見了鶴見，「哦，還有一個漂亮的小夥子，當然是鶴見玉兒哪！」</p>
<p>單眼鏡紳士，頓時顯出一副尷尬面孔，把乎指在椅背上談了三四下，也許是一種什麽暗號，接着開了車門，鑽下車去；把車門重又砰的關上。老人伸出一隻手，撫在單限鏡紳士背上，邀着他朝路對而走去。這時鶴見，猛然覺得有一隻柔潤的小手，探了過來，輕輕撫在自己的手背上，一隻食指，不住地敲着，鶴見知道這是秘密電訊的警報，—搭搭蒂搭—警報敲完，接着就是電訊：「小心烟匣。前途無碍，小心烟匣，前途無碍！……這道是德國特工，他們的上士，是近衛……首相。……鼓起勇氣來！小心烟匣，最好交給我罷！」</p>
<p>「老人是誰？」鶴見輕輕抽出那隻接電訊的手，撫在萍子的手上，一樣敲着，發出電訊。</p>
<p>「對不起」萍子又依原式，有規律的敲着，「我以爲你認識他們……老人是元老派西國寺親信門生，井上淸木長老，全國佛宗首腦，……」</p>
<p>「明白了……」鶴見覆電，「他是我的『劍道』祖師爺—我的師父的祖師，老人劍道無敵，你如認識，要求你引見，我想從他學幾手…好嗎？……他與黑龍會有關係嗎？」</p>
<p>「佛法無邊！…」萍子答覆，「沒有他走不進的社國，豈僅黑龍會！…他的徒子徒孫，滿佈天下，…『不才』便是他最近選列門牆的末代弟子，專門學習『玄術」……</p>
<p>「那麽，你是我的祖師班輩了，失敬得很……！『玄術』是什麼玩意兒？」</p>
<p>「客氣，客氣」；彼此彼此。我預備拜你作『柔道』師父，假如你認爲我够資格：那麽，我們可以扯平了…另外，我還要從你練習支那語，學支那詩…『玄術』與『棒喝術』大同小異；在印度爲彼羅門宗，傳到西藏，演成密宗，在修養上，是成佛之門，在法術上，是『金剛大力』法，可以統制一切武力，只要一心存念，用手一指，可以定身，可以殺人…」</p>

<h3>攤販</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>前夫攤販的糾紛，可說是抗戰勝利後上海所發生的最大一次羣眾鬥毆案件，且不去論這一事件的責任問題，攤販之取締，事前當局是應該加以深思熟慮的，決不能憑一紙命令，不那從者拘捕，就能將攤販取　締了，以壯觀瞻了，杜絕走私貨品了，消滅黑市了，……老實說，達成以上的目的，祇請取締，那是舍本逐末，又何况攤販們不是那樣輕易就能取締得了的。</p>
<p>天下事沒有比饑餓再嚴重的了，他們將本來求利，做點小營生，目的不過在糊口而已，假使有大資本，有辦法，他們又何致於在這樣的風雨交加的天氣露立街頭呢？</p>
<p>我們擁護取締，但更願當局在取締時先要給他們安排下一條出路，就是讓他們能謀生，不然，很容易逼令他們挺而走險的，</p>
<p>在攤販本身，也得替施政者設想，凡所要求，採取軌外行動，結果於自身問題無補，而且將不堪設想。這絕對不是聰明的辦法。現在，問題總算告一段落，倘使給第三者的陰謀所利用，那更會失去社會的同情了。</p>
<h3>時事問答</h3>
<p>— 慧羣</p>
<p>關於聯合國的常識　譯自英文文字林西報</p>
<p>這幾大國外最重要的新聞是聯合國在紐約的大會，每天報紙上除了國民大會的消息之外，一條條約聯大會新聞：什麽限制否決權哩，修改聯合國憲單哩，五强會議哩，充滿了報章篇幅，使不懂國際政治的人看了頭痛，弄不淸楚五強到底在忙些什麼。如果你也是其中一人，只要花三分鐘一念下文，就可以對聯合國憲章得到淸楚而簡要的槪念，從而看到這一類的新聞也不致感到頭痛了——</p>
<p>問：聯合國組織的目的是什麽？</p>
<p>答：憲章上說，聯合國組織的目的，是「維持正義，尊重由條約而生的義務，促進社會進步，提高生活標準，實行思想與信仰自田，大家和睦相處，聯合各會員國的力量保障和平，防止新戰爭」。</p>
<p>問：這個目的如何能實現？各聯合國如何合作？</p>
<p>答：首先，由各會員國，不　是大國或小國，各派代表參加聊合國大會；在大會裏，每個國家不論大小各有一票表決權。</p>
<p>問：俄國在事實不是有三票表決權嗎？</p>
<p>答：蘇維埃社會主義共和國聯邦只有一票表決權，然而烏克闌共和國和白俄羅斯共和國因爲有獨立的外交部和外交部長，所以也各有一票表決權。</p>
<p>問：不列顚帝國不是有六票表決權嗎？</p>
<p>答：各自治領，印度，和聯合王國（英國本部）各有一票表決權，就像從前在國際聯盟裏一樣。</p>
<p>問：聯合國大會的任務是什麽？</p>
<p>答：聯合國大會討論各種國際問題，並且能够向所有會員國家提出建議。</p>
<p>問：牠能够建議修改現存條約嗎？</p>
<p>答：不能够。在舊金山會議中，埃及曾經提議給聯合國大會這種權限，這議案只獲得幾個國家的支持，十多數國家認爲這樣一來，使聯合國大會所增加的困難比牠能解決的困難更多。</p>
<p>問：什麽是「安全理事會」？</p>
<p>答：安全理事會是聯合國的執行機關。牠的任務是硏究，討論，並且用和平方法來解決國家間的糾紛。如果有一個國家破壞和平或者實行侵略，安全理事會要召集會員國採取必要步驟以保障和平。</p>
<p>問：這意思是不是說安全理事會可以命令一個國家參加戰爭呢？</p>
<p>答；不。任何會員國如果願意，可以訂立特約把自己的全部或一部兵力交給安全理事會運用。安全理事會只有糊請求各會員國和侵略國斷絕經濟或政治關係，各會員國並沒有參加戰爭的義務。</p>
<p>問：如果兩個會員國家間有了糾紛應該怎樣？</p>
<p>答：牠們應該儘可能自行和平解決，如果解決不了，任何一方都可把糾紛提出於安全理事會；或者安全理事會自動加以干涉</p>
<p>問：以後怎樣？</p>
<p>答：安全理事會先從事調査，調査淸楚之後可以建議解決糾紛的方法；如果問題是有關法律的問題，牠可以請國際法庭來受理這事。</p>
<p>問；何謂國際法庭？</p>
<p>答：國際法庭是由根據特定章則所揀出的許多著名的律師所組成，有審判的權限，關於條約解釋有疑義之類的問題，國際法庭可以受理並依照國際公法而判決。</p>
<p>問：國際法庭也管政治問題嗎？</p>
<p>答：不。國際法庭只管純　法律問題，政治問題應由安全理事會本身依據聯合國憲章之原則提出建議解決之。</p>
<p>問：是否所有會壘國都應該遵守安全理事會的法　呢？</p>
<p>答：是的。各會　國　同意一依照憲章接受並履　　全理事會之決議」。</p>
<p>問：那麽，是否在遷營情形，所有糾紛均應由牽連國家自動和平解決，或由理事會代爲解決？</p>
<p>答：是的。用和平方法來解決所有糾紛是安全理事會的重要任務。　（未完）</p>

<p>「奪桶子」之戰</p>
<p>自戰事發生以來，新建里弄旣完全停止，若干新式里弄且已添用看門警察，爲保持清潔計，絕對不允許丐流在弄中建立「桶子」。因此桶十有减無增，而後起的新丐却欣欣茁發。新丐每歎無「桶」自容，於是不得不發動侵奪戰了。在攻勢發動之先，侵略者使無事生事，向有桶丐帮提無理之要求。丐帮自加拒絕。於是侵略者便故意張揚，務使事態擴大。防守者察知，於是慌忙呼集黨羽，四出請討救兵。雙方調動已竣，武劇便開塲了。只看勝負得失如何，便可決定「桶子」之誰屬。可是不論何方獲勝，失敗者決不肯干休。於是重整軍容，又來再度尋　。從此紛爭遂無寧日，流血慘劇也就接連而來。所以長厚的丐流都不敢輕易啓釁。而且饑餓同帮酌量收容流丐以免爭端。道也是丐帮避免間類相殘的一種德政吧！</p>
<p>搶冷飯的技術</p>
<p>老弟兄丐帮原以「搶冷飯」爲解決民生的不二法門。自從戰事發生以後，柴米供應困難，包飯作相繼停業，使丐帮中人大感痛苦。今幸勝利後一切漸復舊觀，商家又紛紛包飯，老弟兄可以恢復前此之口福之奉了。在內地，乞丐本可向住戶人家討剩飯吃的；但在上海，每個人家都僱有大食的娘姨車夫，結果主人剩下來的飯食，不論多少；都由此輩底下人全部包辦。而且老弟兄丐帮，向例就沒有向住家乞討的權利。他們唯一的辦法便是攔住馬路搶冷飯　上海店家每日例須包飯二餐，每餐由這夥挑送來往，吃後　有不少剩飯和殘看冷湯；丐流攔路守候，等到挑飯人走過，便前遮後擁地强迫停擔。自動巧取豪奪，把冷飯殘肴席捲而去。搶得後須提出一部份給與爺叔，餘數才狼吞虎咽，以爲果腹。以上海市面之大，吃包飯的人數至少在數十萬以上，每日剩飯之多，目可以使丐流們維持他們的生命了。</p>
<p>可是搶冷飯也不是很太平的工作，每値丐流攔路，店夥自不肯俯首帖耳，一任打刦，他會抽出挑擔的扁棍作武器，向着小鬼們頭上亂敲。這時小鬼們志在搶飯，無心戀戰，採取不抵抗主義，聲忍受打。表示其吃得起苦，而飯則非搶不可。丐帮的理由是說：「人家包飯的錢已給你們賺够了，這剩下來的冷飯並不是屬於你們的。是留下來養活窮小鬼的」。</p>
<h3>你有下列惡習慣嗎？</h3>
<p>— 王建德</p>
<p>「赤胆忠心」在某院上映時，有一部笑料豐富的短片加映，片中描寫盡了一切關於戲院子中所能發生的許多不良而奇怪的動作習慣，而這些動作習慣，在我們上海的許多戲院裏，更是感到現實與親切。</p>
<p>最普通的，在開映時還不肯脫去戴在他頭上保護腦殼的帽子，讓後面的觀衆享受到一片黑。有些嗜食者，即使在開映時，他們也不肯使他們的嘴吧有一忽兒的休息，花生米，西瓜子，剝殼，打開紙包聲有時會閙成一片，使旁的觀衆只看見銀慕上的主角的口開閉着，說些什麽，只有莫明其妙。有些人坐在走路旁更兼很知享福，伸出了一隻腿在外而，魯莽的某些遲到者，往往會就此跌一大交。溫軟的沙發，有幾位觀衆還是橫不舒服，緊不愜意，他的足伸入了前排觀衆的座椅，仍是輾轉不休，好意思，人家化了數小時，想來找一下消遣，你倒打斷了他的興緻。也許是某些人的天生不好靜吧！他們往往不安於位，即使短短的一二小時，座位掉了又掉，擠進擠出，大家爲你立正，有時更會享到被踏一脚的滋味；在戲院子裏抽香烟，在上海是早已禁止了，但是那天我親眼看見一位觀客一枝在手，你看他是多麽悠然呀，但那是在黑暗之中，電影正在開映着。</p>

<h3>寓言</h3>
<p>— 戈鳴</p>
<p>江南人民在西北風裘踡縮起來，一夜的寒雲，落得緊，貧苦人需求冬令救濟的呼聲也更迫切，更可憫了。</p>
<p>爲自己進補，在有錢人是視爲當然之事，肯不肯救貧民之苦，庇他人之寒，那只有他自己肚裏明白，寒傖如我，有心無力，眞不知如何是好，就說一個新伊索寓言，聊以貢獻給有錢的人們罷。</p>
<p>那是一個猪和牛的故事。這一天，猪向牛訴苦，說自己眞不得人心，並且眞不出風頭。猪說：「人們老是誇獎你的心腸慷慨，眼睛和善！』接下去，猪滔滔地說：『不錯，你會榨乳，你也會做成乳酪，可是，我的貢獻，實在比你的更多哩！我送出了肉不算，而且送出了火腿。此外，我還拿鬃毛送人，同時人們又醃我的腿！而人們還是不高興我，猪，到頭來總是一隻猪。這究竟是什麼道理？』</p>
<p>牛，在這時思索了一下，回答道；『那也許是因爲我是在我活着的時候就貢獻我的所有，完全跟你的作風不同的原故。』</p>
<p>看了上述的故事，我不知道你（作爲人類的你）是否也思索了一下。許多人，在活着的時候，吝吝啬啬，除了消耗或攫取一些世界上原有的東西之外，什麼都不曾生產一些，增加一些，貢獻一些，或施捨一些，懷着未見得能在猪的智慧以上的『智慧』，即使在臨死之前，裝作慷慨，裝作激昂，我看，其命運也往往是毁多於譽，敗蹟多於成就，心勞日絀而已。</p>
<h3>制止揩油　設站售票</h3>
<p>— 鶴松</p>
<p>電車漲價已有二星期了。電車公司請求漲價的理由，除「物價高漲」一項外，還有一條說是由於「軍人無票搭乘」所引起的損失。有人說，只要電車售票員不揩汕，將票款全數交給公司，也就可以使公司增加些收入了。售票員揩油眞是件「盡人皆知」的事了，我希望電車公司能有方法洗消滅這種情形，我謹向電車公司進個建議。</p>
<p>售票員措油，不外是用不找零票，和不給車票兩種方法，而這兩種方法，大都在乘客擁擠的時候行施，因爲在擁擠時是誰也不想多找麻煩的，能馬虎就馬虎了。</p>
<p>要避免乘客擁擠，在目前恐怕做不到，上海的人實在太多了。但售票員所以能作弊，却完全是由他們經手銀錢的緣故。要使他們不經手銀錢，只有不在車上售票一法，我建議：在各主要站上設售票站，全日出售車票，這樣，大家有充分的時間去買票，售票員就無法可想了。</p>
<p>而且，道樣辦的話，每列電車上只要有一個管理員，不像現在要一個人管門，一個人賣票了，公司可省下一筆錢，豈非一舉二得？</p>
<p>當一個票員塞滿了人的電軍裏工作時，售票員的苦悶是可想而知的，乘客也會感覺極大的不愉快，何况常有這種揩油的事發生？爲乘客，爲公司自己，我希望電車公司能試辦「車外售票」！在美製自動售票器尙未在一我國使用之前，這未始不是一個好方法。</p>

<h3>審議憲草聲中　談王寵惠博士</h3>
<p>— 純父</p>
<p>國大在南京已召開了十多天。關係中國百年大計的由華民國憲草修正案，就要提出國大審議通過。這憲草修正案的整理人，便是這裏要提起的王寵惠博士。</p>
<p>關於新憲草的內容，王氏在本月二十五日對本報記者稱：係根據政協原則，折火各方意見擬成，新的制度，爲介於總統制及內閣制間的一種新創制度。我們大槪總可以記得：王氏對於憲法學方面向有獨到的造詣，民國元年，南京臨時政府成立，王氏任首屆外交總長的時候，就著有「中華民國憲法芻議」一　，爲中外人士所注意。</p>
<p>王氏爲世界有名的法學家，又是外交界老前輩。他曾兩度出任海牙國際法庭法官，在國內任過司法，外交各總長。</p>
<p>王氏字亮　，原籍廣東東莞縣，與蔣光　氏同里。其父煜初，是一位道氣盎然的老牧師，和國父及陳少白，區鳳墀等均屬故交。王氏幼年在香港皇仁書院讀書，天資聰穎，嘗與其父駁論宗敎會理，觸乃父之怒，奔上海任南洋公學敎員，旋在北洋大學堂卒業，留學美國，專攻法律，得耶魯大學法學博士位。不久又在英倫考取英國律師資格，懸牌執業，國人在外國執業律師，實推王氏爲第一人。</p>
<p>王氏與革命亦有淵源，遠在同盟會尙未成立時，王氏在東京，會與沈翔雲·秦力山·戢　　等，同辦「國民報」，倡導民族主義，鼓吹革命甚力。王氏是時所担任的爲英文部撰述。光緒三十一年，國父行抵紐約，王氏也在美國費城鼓吹革命。國父函的王氏到紐約見面，密商進行辦法，當時就發表了中國革命史上的重要文獻—對外宣會。</p>
<p>南京臨時政府成立，王氏首任外交總長。店紹儀內閣時，轉任司法總長，因反對袁世凱政策，與國民黨閣員，同時解職。其時國父在上海設立鐵路總公司，被聘爲顧問。後又任過樂士飴內閣的司法總長，唐紹儀內　的敎育總長，一度署理國務總理，組織「好人內閣」。</p>
<p>中國的外交界上，和姓王的委實結了不能　，王　惠·王正廷·王世杰都任過外交部長。王　惠在民國二十六年，繼張羣出長外交部，時正外侮日亟，王氏憑着他標榜的「三不主義」—不推諉，不敷衍，不畏難，頗有成就。抗戰爆發後，日方一再造謠分化，說王氏「不滿黨府」，「決心出走」，在僞「新申報」胡說八道地狂吠一陣。</p>
<p>王氏擅長詞令，猶記得在民國二十一年前，中國還閙着分裂局面。在國聯召開大會時，王寵惠代表南　國民政府出席，當時有某國代表會戰問王氏：『君所代表者，係　國之中央政府乎？抑係　國之西南政府乎？』道問題無疑是西人輕視中國的心理表現，而我們的王博士却　閒的回答這位毫無禮貌的問者：「余所代表者，爲　國所承認之由國政府。」末了，正如王氏的希望一樣，我們也渴望『新的憲章能爲大多數民衆所滿意！』</p>

<h3>The Constitutional Draft Can Now Be Reviewed. The National Assembly Holds Its Sixth General Meeting Today to Discuss Grouping and Rosters.</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Assembly will hold its sixth general meeting on the 2nd. The morning session, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, will be chaired by Bai Chongxi, and the afternoon session, from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, will be chaired by Bai Yunti. The presidium will consist of Jiang Zhongzheng, Hu Shi, Zhang Lisheng, Gu Zhenggang, Ahemaitijiang, Kong Xiangxi, Huang Guoshu, Ding Weifen, and Guo Zhongwei from the first group. Tian Jiongjin will be on duty. The agenda of the general meeting, in addition to expressing opinions on the constitutional draft, will include discussing the organizational methods of the Root Grass Review Committee, grouping, and roster issues. It is possible that group review will begin as early as the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Assembly Representatives' Association held a fellowship meeting at the National Assembly First Guesthouse at 10:00 AM on the 1st, attended by over 300 people. Kong Geng, Sun Mujia, and others spoke, creating a lively atmosphere. Important decisions were made as follows: (1) Determine the period for implementing the constitution; (2) Draft a revision of the May 5th Constitutional Draft; (3) Request the assembly to postpone the discussion of the constitutional draft for two weeks. It is rumored that if the constitutional draft is still based on the one promulgated by the National Government, they plan to create their own constitution.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Regarding the term of office of the National Assembly representatives, Representative Zhang Jichuan stated that although the National Assembly Organization Law stipulates that the representative's mission ends when the session ends, if the date for constitutional implementation determined by the assembly must be changed in the future due to circumstances, who will make the decision? The National Government is the highest organ for exercising administrative power, not the highest organ for the people to exercise political power, and clearly has no power to change the decision of the National Assembly. Therefore, in legal terms, the current representatives must re-deliberate. Thus, the termination of the term of office of the National Assembly representatives at the time of constitutional implementation is logically consistent in fact.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The National Assembly Secretariat held a work conference at 10:00 AM on the 1st to review the work of the past month. Secretary-General Hong Lanyou personally presided over the meeting, expressing his appreciation for the hard work of the staff in various units and encouraging them to redouble their efforts in the future to achieve success. During the meeting, each unit raised questions regarding its own work, and Hong provided instructions separately.</p>
<h3>Celebrating the 23rd Anniversary of its Founding, the Youth Party Issues a Declaration Explaining its Views on the Current Situation and the Constitutional Draft</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The 2nd is the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Youth Party. The party is scheduled to hold a press conference at 11:30 AM on the 2nd to report on the party's history.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Youth Party issued a declaration on the 2nd, the 23rd anniversary of the party, explaining the party's attitude towards the current situation and its views on the constitutional draft. It stated in brief: Now that the constitution is progressing from discussion to completion, it is foreseeable that the majority of National Assembly representatives come from the people and must be deeply aware of the people's desire for peace and order. The constitution they formulate will be fair and accessible, capable of promoting national unity, uniting the people's welfare, and a democratic constitution, rather than a biased, stubborn, disruptive, and unable to stop disruption anti-democratic constitution. However, the formulation of the constitution is only one aspect of the country's major policies. During the transitional period from the constitution's deliberation and promulgation to its implementation, the people are suffering, and there are numerous issues to be addressed. How to reform politics, stabilize finance, restore transportation, and promote production, and through domestic consolidation, enhance international status and ensure world peace, all these aspects require the cooperation of all political parties and social elites to strive towards the goal. The party's founding goals are to strive for national unity and independence externally and to strive for the people's freedom and equality internally. If these two goals can be achieved through peaceful means, then it will spare no cost to strive for peace. If they cannot be achieved through peaceful means, then it will spare no cost to engage in revolution. After the Mukden Incident, the party, aware of the severity of the national crisis, prioritized ensuring the country's survival and independence, and began to work hand in hand with various parties in the wilderness to jointly engage in the sacred War of Resistance. After victory, the threat of foreign invasion has temporarily decreased, and the democratic structure urgently needs to be created. It then gathered with parties in and out of the government to advance from consultation to joint constitution-making, aiming to establish a foundation for long-term peace and stability in the country. For 23 years, the goals the party has sought have been gradually realized, but the difficulties ahead still exist. National unity and independence still need to be completed, and the people's freedom and equal rights need to be further protected. This is why the party comrades dare not shirk their responsibility. Today, what the people of the whole country expect is national peace and the construction of a peaceful and prosperous life for the people. To achieve these two goals, it is necessary to resolutely end the turbulent situation of internal and external troubles and constant warfare for 35 years, quickly formulate a constitution recognized by the whole country, and on the basis of constitutional government, complete democratic unification, so that the country's foundation can gradually become stable and peaceful construction can be expected. During the War of Resistance, the party worked together with various parties in and out of the government to lay the foundation for victory. Now, at the beginning of this victory and the beginning of construction, how can it shirk its responsibility? Therefore, at the beginning of the convening of this constitutional National Assembly, the party resolutely advocated participation, and expected leaders of all political parties and social elites to participate together, so that the democratic constitution can be completed as soon as possible and the people's welfare can be guaranteed. The party comrades believe that this hope not only represents the opinions of one party and one faction, but is the common psychology of the vast majority of people in the country. Any democratic party must understand the true public opinion and must decide its own actions based on this public opinion.</p>
<h3>Ma Chaojun Hosted All Vocational Representatives Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Ma Chaojun, Minister of Agriculture and Industry, hosted over a hundred National Assembly vocational representatives, including Wang Xiaolai, Lu Jingshi, and Wen Shaohe, at the Central Party Headquarters at 3:30 PM on the 1st. Ma Chaojun delivered a speech, expressing his deep regret that there was no provision for a vocational representative system in the constitution. It is said that the vocational representative system has a long history in our country. When Sun Yat-sen served as the Extraordinary President in Guangzhou in 1920, he advocated this system and implemented it. The following year, the Guangzhou Municipal Council was established, and some of the representatives were elected by vocational groups. Later, Sun Yat-sen went north and issued a declaration convening a National Assembly, which was convened in Beijing in 1931 and had representatives from vocational armies and women. The election law of 1932 also confirmed the status of vocational representatives, and many local councils also had representatives elected by vocational groups participating. It is a pity that the People's Political Council during the War of Resistance did not have vocational representatives, which was regretted by people both at home and abroad. Sun Yat-sen had already promoted this progressive system 20 years ago, which shows his foresight. Farmers, industrialists, and merchants are the most important elements in establishing a country, while the party, government, and army are only elements in governing a country. If there are only regional representatives and vocational representatives are ignored, then the situation at the lower levels will have no way to reach the upper levels, and all power will be completely controlled by the bourgeoisie, special classes, and local tyrants and evil gentry, forming an unequal phenomenon. I was the earliest advocate of the vocational representative system, and I hope that the most progressive system can be included in this constitution. I also hope that vocational representatives can participate in the provincial, municipal, and county councils in the future. After Ma finished speaking, the representatives spoke one after another, all advocating that efforts should be made to fight for this point. Wang Xiaolai, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, reported on his contacts with various parties. According to him, when he met with Chairman Jiang the other day, he had personally expressed this hope, hoping that the National Assembly would not forget the farmers, industrialists, and merchants who are the foundation of the country, and must not be lightly regarded or casually dealt with. The representatives elected by the farmers, industrialists, and merchants are the true representatives of the people. To seek national prosperity and strength, it is impossible to abandon the fundamentals and neglect vocational representatives.</p>
<h3>Li Huang Has Been Discharged from the Hospital; Zuo Shunsheng and Others Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Youth Party National Assembly representatives Yang Yongjun and Zuo Shunsheng have returned to Shanghai one after another to handle private affairs. On the 1st, Zuo told reporters that after the revised draft of the constitution was submitted to the National Assembly for discussion, two different opinions emerged in the meeting. Some believed that the revised draft could only represent the opinions of the political parties of the Political Consultative Conference and that there were still many points that needed to be revised. Others insisted on using the May 5th Constitutional Draft as a blueprint. The Youth Party representatives did not speak on this matter and planned to express their opinions in the review committee. When asked by reporters about his views on the future existence of the National Political Council, he said that after the current National Assembly closes, there will still be a period of time before the constitution is implemented. During this period, the National Political Council still seems to be necessary, and its powers should also be expanded so that the effectiveness of the public opinion organs can be fully exerted. Zuo is scheduled to take the night train to Beijing tonight to continue participating in the National Assembly. Yang Yongjun is also scheduled to go to Beijing within days. According to Dr. Wu Tianmin, Li Huang was discharged from the hospital on the afternoon of the 1st. His illness has fully recovered. He has not yet decided when to go to Beijing. According to relevant sources, Li did go to Chongqing for a short trip during his illness for recuperation and had no other tasks.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Ma Visits the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Special Envoy Ma and Ambassador Stuart visited Chairman Chiang together at 4:00 PM on the 1st and left at 5:00 PM. It is rumored that Ma and Stuart will go to Yan'an. According to the spokesperson of the CCP office, nothing has been heard.</p>
<h3>The Chairman Hosts a Banquet for Border Representatives, and Minister Bai Also Hosts a Banquet at the Same Time</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet for border representatives Qi Quanxi, Su Hederi, and others at his official residence at 8:00 PM on the 1st, and invited Bai Chongxi and others to accompany him. Bai Chongxi also hosted border representatives attending the National Assembly at the Ministry of National Defense at 6:00 PM on the 1st, including Qi Quanxi, Su Hederi, Chen Aide, Nibatu, Qiao Jiafu, Liu Ping, Bai Rui, Rong Zhao, Ba Wenlin, Tudan Sangpi, Ce Zaidunzhu, Tudeng Sengge, Dorje Ozhu, Cai Ren Gui, Xiong Nuo, and Hong Zhu, totaling over a hundred people. They exchanged views on constitution-making at the National Assembly, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves, dispersing at around 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Mongolian Representatives Host Reporters, Requesting that the Status of the League and Banner Be Confirmed and Autonomy Granted</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Assembly's Mongolian representatives held a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters in the National Assembly lounge at 2:00 PM on the 1st. The heads and members of each league and banner representative group attended. The head of the representative group from Hulunbuir Butha of the Jerim League of Mongolia, Jin Yanghao, the deputy head Zhuo Rentuo, and Bao Deben and ten group members. The heads of the representative groups from the Josutu and Juu Uda Leagues of Mongolia, Yun Dan Sangbu, the deputy head Zha Qisichin, and four group members. The head of the representative group from the Alxa Banner, Dalizhaya, and the Ejin Banner, Dawa. Bai Yunti first introduced and gave a speech, stating: The Mongolian issue is the Chinese issue. China is now convening the National Assembly to make a constitution. It is heard that Chairman Chiang advocates adding the Mongolian League and Banner areas to the revised constitutional draft. We also hope to have the following requests when making the constitution: (1) All leagues and banners of the Republic of China are equal, and ethnic minorities living in fixed areas should have their autonomy rights guaranteed. (2) The generation of representatives to the National Assembly should give the Mongolian banners and all counties equal rights. (3) In the election of central government legislators, the Mongolian leagues and departments should elect 30 representatives and 17 supervisory committee members. (4) In the powers of the central and local governments and the local system, the leagues and departments, the provincial banners, and the counties should enjoy equal status and powers. (5) The banner is the local autonomous unit of the Mongolian region. (6) In the national economy, animal husbandry should be protected so that the welfare of herders and farmers can be equally emphasized. Rong Xiang then reported on three points: In terms of politics, since the victory, the banners have handled restoration faster than the provincial government. National identity cards were issued in exchange for enemy and puppet good citizen certificates, but when the provincial government returned, these identity cards were torn up, causing serious problems. We do not want to be exempted from taxes or conscription, and hope that the central government will handle it reasonably. In terms of economy, the banners cannot obtain agricultural loans and relief materials. In terms of education, it is hoped that those who run education in the central government can generally take care of the Mongolian compatriots in the banners. Jin Yanghao then reported on the current situation of the Mongolian banners in the Northeast, stating briefly that the focus of the banner issue is in Wangye Temple. When the 815 victory was achieved last year, the Mongolian compatriots expected the central government to go to take over. When Outer Mongolia announced its independence on August 24 and Tibet had a high degree of autonomy, some people believed that after Outer Mongolia became independent, the Mongolian issue had been resolved. However, Inner Mongolia has a population of 2.8 to 2.9 million, various special products, and more than 7 million heads of livestock. Inner Mongolia can be allowed a high degree of autonomy, and Inner Mongolia also launched an initiative. On January 17, 18, and 19 this year, the All-League General Assembly was held in Wangye Temple, deciding to request the Mongolian banners to be autonomous from the Republic of China. Later, due to the military and economic pressure of the CCP, it moved from Wangye Temple to Hailar. However, they still wanted to contact the central government. In January of this year, it sent a military representative to contact the central government, but when they arrived in Beiping, government officials dissuaded them, saying that the government was busy with restoration. The representative's opinions originally had the following points: (1) What is the central government's policy towards Mongolia? (2) Will the resolutions of the Central Plenary Session on the Mongolian issue be implemented? (3) How will the troops returning from Hailar be arranged? (4) Are those who worked in the puppet Mongolian government considered to have committed a crime? How the central government will answer is still unknown, but they do not want to listen but want to see the 22 Mongolian banners in the Northeast. Only three banners have been restored, and they have only been delivered to the provincial government. There is a lack of funding, and in fact, they have not yet been restored. At the time of victory, the private property of the banners was more than 40 billion circulating notes, and the public property was more than 3 billion, all of which were lost. I now hope that the government will: (1) Issue restoration funds. (2) Restore education as soon as possible. At the same time, the status of the banners should be clearly stipulated in the constitution, the relevant resolutions of the Second Plenary Session concerning the banners should be implemented as soon as possible, and more funds should be allocated for relief. Zha Qisichin then reported the following: (1) The purpose of going to Beijing is to pay tribute to Chairman Chiang and report the local situation to the central authorities and state the hopes and pains of the Mongolian people. (2) Regarding the National Assembly, I hope to follow Sun Yat-sen's teachings and formulate a constitution that allows all ethnic groups in the Republic of China to survive equally and share prosperity, and to determine the autonomous rights of the ancient ethnic groups and the status of the leagues and banners. (3) The Mongolian autonomy movement is the unanimous demand of all Mongolians. (4) Regarding the government, I hope that the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session on border issues will be implemented as soon as possible. (5) I hope that the government will grasp the reality of Mongolia and reform its policy towards Mongolia so that the complex situation in Inner Mongolia can be clarified. (6) The vast majority of the people in Inner Mongolia unanimously support the government and are willing to implement autonomy under the Three Principles of the People. Finally, Bai Yunti made a conclusion, hoping that reporters could speak out more for the small ethnic groups. The meeting dispersed at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Under the Condition of Not Harming Friendship, the National Army Will Take Over Dalian; The Communist Army is Preparing to Withdraw, and All Materials Have Been Moved Away</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] Sources related to the matter said that under the condition of not harming friendship, the National Army may take over Dalian in the near future. The Communist Army in that area is preparing to withdraw, and all important materials have been moved away. Some have been transported to Jiaodong, and a certain army has made arrangements in Longtutang on both sides of Lushun.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] Official intelligence: The Northeast continues to advance south from Fuxian and has gradually entered the periphery of Dalian. The Dalian Communist Army is actively preparing to withdraw, and the machinery of the city's twelve iron factories and one arsenal has been dismantled and selected.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Inner Mongolian Autonomy: Representatives from Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan Advocate Granting Regional Autonomy; Counties Can Be Abolished Where Mongolians Outnumber Han Chinese</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan National Assembly Representatives Association held a press conference at the National Assembly Hall lounge at 10:00 AM on the 1st. Suiyuan representative Pan Xiuren, Chahar representative Ma Daying, and Rehe representative Cheng Pengyi gave reports respectively. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) Currently, people across the country are concerned about the issue of Inner Mongolia, but some may not be clear about it. (2) The situation in Inner Mongolia is definitely different from that in Outer Mongolia and Tibet because Inner Mongolia is an area where Han and Mongolians live together, and there are also intermarriages. This is not only the case in the county, but also in the banner. (3) According to statistics of Han and Mongolian people in the provinces, Suiyuan has a population of more than 2.3 million, of which Mongolians account for about 150,000. Chahar has a population of more than 2.9 million, of which Mongolians account for about 80,000. Rehe has a population of more than 7.8 million, of which Mongolians account for more than 200,000. Except for a few Mongolian compatriots in remote areas who still maintain a nomadic lifestyle, their lifestyles are mostly the same, and they can speak Mandarin and learn Chinese. (4) Rights and obligations: In terms of rights, Han and Mongolians are equal. In terms of obligations, Mongolian compatriots have always been valued. During the War of Resistance, they were not conscripted or taxed. (5) We sympathize with the principle of autonomy for the Mongolian banners, but it should be regional autonomy, that is, local autonomy. Our proposals are as follows: (1) Equal autonomy based on the local people in the same place, regional autonomy. If Mongolians outnumber Han Chinese, then the Mongolian compatriots should be responsible for local administrative responsibilities. The county government can also be abolished, but one place must not have two administrative agencies. (2) If there are fewer Mongolian compatriots in the county, the Mongolian compatriots should also be guaranteed their due rights and political status. (3) The central government can give Mongolian compatriots preferential treatment everywhere. (4) Mongolian banner education should be specially subsidized. (5) No more land should be opened up in undeveloped areas. (6) More health institutions should be established, and livestock should be improved to develop economic life.</p>
<h3>Chief of General Staff Chen Presides Over the Memorial Week of the Central Training Corps</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Chief of General Staff Chen arrived at the Central Training Corps at 9:00 AM on the 1st to preside over the Memorial Week. He gave a brief speech to the directors of the branch corps and the heads of the officers' corps who came to Beijing to participate in the officers' corps leaders' meeting. He praised the achievements of the demobilized officers in defending against internal and external enemies over the years and encouraged all demobilized officers to actively participate in re-employment training so that consumption can be transformed into production and destruction can be transformed into construction. He especially hoped that they would join forces to build the country. After the speech, he convened a meeting of the directors of the branch corps and the heads of the officers' corps to listen to reports and give instructions: (1) The officers' corps is set up for surplus personnel.

<h3>Pan Chaoying, Chinese Expert Committee Member of the United Nations General Assembly, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Talks to Reporters About International Perspectives</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Dr. Pan Chaoying, expert committee member of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, recently returned to China and arrived in Shanghai to attend the National Assembly. According to his comments to reporters, the five major issues of the United Nations General Assembly have not yet reached an agreement. However, according to general observations, the following conclusions may be reached: (1) "Veto Power": The Soviet Union firmly insists on retaining it, and the United States and Britain also express their approval in principle, but hope that it will be used with some restraint. The major premise is that the opinions of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union tend to be consistent. It is unlikely that there will be significant changes. (2) "Disarmament": Countries have not yet expressed confidence and sincerity on this issue, and it is feared that it will be difficult to implement. (3) "Trusteeship": The opinions put forward by various countries, after comprehensive revisions, may lead to an agreement. (4) "Economic, Social, and Cultural Cooperation": Including the United Nations General Assembly, countries have different opinions and disputes are fierce, but misunderstandings will eventually disappear. (5) "United Nations Headquarters": In the future, the eastern part of the United States may be selected. The proposal to locate it in San Francisco is unlikely to pass. In addition, Pan also mentioned that China's future foreign policy must thoroughly abandon "opportunism" and establish its own diplomatic foundation from a stable national policy.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Mayor Wu's Broadcast Speech on the Shanghai Riot Incident</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At 8 PM last night, Mayor Wu, at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station at No. 3 Da Xi Road, reported on the situation of the rioters taking the opportunity to cause disturbances in the past two days, and the emergency measures taken by the municipal government to quell the riot and maintain order. He also ordered all stores in the city to operate as usual from today. Those who attempt to cause trouble and endanger public security will be killed without exception. Mayor Wu, accompanied by Ouyang Zunquan, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, Zhu Chubai, Director of the News Release Department, and Zhou Weiting, Director of the Jing'an Temple Police Sub局, went to the radio station at 7:30 PM, where they were received by Chen Bin, Section Chief of the station, and took a brief rest. At 8 PM, the mayor began broadcasting, which lasted for thirty-four minutes. The full text is as follows: "Fellow citizens, I am now reporting to all citizens of the city on the disturbances that occurred in our city yesterday and today. Rioters took the opportunity to disrupt public order, causing damage and insult to everyone and all stores. I would like to express my deepest sympathy to everyone. The course of the riots and the municipal government's handling of this incident are as follows: (1) Let's start with the issue of</p>
<p>Street Vendors. In July of this year, the Municipal Council passed a resolution to ban street vendors in the Huangpu and Old Zha districts due to traffic congestion. The municipal government must consider the interests of the public. Before September of this year, traffic in the central district was often blocked, for at least half an hour, or even one or two hours, causing inconvenience to citizens' movements. After the improvement of traffic in the central district, there has been significant progress. Shanghai is tied to international reputation, and all parties also agree that traffic is too disorderly and must be improved. However, if street vendors in the central district are not banned, the traffic obstruction situation will be difficult to improve. When the decision was made to ban street vendors, their livelihood was also fully considered, so a deadline of August, September, and October was given, urging them to relocate their businesses or find other livelihoods during this period. On the one hand, the municipal government must consider the livelihoods of street vendors, and on the other hand, it must consider the interests of the majority of citizens and strive to maintain order. Therefore, the banning of street vendors is a last resort for the government. (2) Rioters used the street vendor issue as an excuse to spread rumors, claiming that the detained street vendors were refused food and clothing, resulting in deaths from freezing and starvation. They also rumored that the Huangpu Sub局 opened fire and</p>
<p>Killed People. I must clarify this point. The municipal government implements administrative orders to seek public interest. The police bureau executes orders and is extremely lenient in execution. The original plan was to complete the ban by the end of October, but today is already December 1st, which shows that the police bureau's execution is not very strict. However, the implementation of administrative orders must be thorough. Chinese and foreign newspapers have criticized the municipal government for its inability to ban street vendors as scheduled. As for the police bureau's punishment of street vendors, a fine is imposed for the first and second violations of setting up a stall, and detention is only imposed for the third violation. During the detention period, the police bureau provides food and drink. If family members send clothing and food, they only need to obey the order and line up to enter, and there is no refusal. Rioters spread rumors that street vendors starved and froze to death in the detention center. Yesterday, I, along with city councilors and many journalists, went to the Huangpu Sub局 to investigate and found that this was not the case. Bureau Chief Du is willing to guarantee with his life that if anyone died from freezing or starvation, he would accept the most severe punishment. If you find that it is true and provide evidence, you can report it and it will be handled according to Bureau Chief Du's guarantee. Yesterday, there were also rumors that the police bureau opened fire and killed people. This is even more untrue, completely a rumor fabricated by rioters to stir up public sentiment in order to achieve their</p>
<p>Riot Conspiracy. It is also said that the Huangpu Sub局 has abused the detained vendors. If this is the case, the government will thoroughly investigate it. However, after I went to the sub局 yesterday to investigate, I can also guarantee that there is no abuse as rumored. (3) The results of the investigation into the riots in the past two days show that street vendors cannot possibly carry out such a planned and organized riot, and endanger social order and the safety of everyone's life and property. Yesterday afternoon, the crowd in front of the Huangpu Sub局 claimed that there were still more than 300 street vendors detained in the sub局. However, all street vendors had already been released before 12 PM in the morning. When I went to the detention center of the sub局 at 5 PM in the afternoon, there were no street vendors inside. This proves that the crowd surrounding the sub局 was not street vendors, but rioters. This is proof number one. Four representatives of the Huangpu and Old Zha districts came to my house today to declare that the</p>
<p>Disruptive Acts of Destroying Stores, Damaging Vehicles,</p>
<p>Blocking Traffic, and Setting Fires, and other illegal behaviors, have nothing to do with them. They also stated that they only went to the City Council yesterday afternoon to petition and did not go to the Huangpu Sub局 to petition at all. Then it can certainly be proven that those in front of the Huangpu Sub局 were not street vendors. This is proof number two. The four representatives personally wrote a statement, the original of which has been submitted to the Central News Agency for publication and will be available in tomorrow's newspapers. Yesterday, when traffic vehicles and stores were destroyed on Nanjing Road and Beijing Road, many perpetrators were captured. After questioning, it was found that none of them were street vendors. This is proof number three. All of the above proves that the riots in the past two days have nothing to do with street vendors. (4) In the riots in the past two days, rioters divided into groups and routes, disrupting social security everywhere and disturbing everyone's peace. Ask whether street vendors have this organizational ability? It proves that this is an organized and planned disruption of public security, absolutely not done by street vendors, this is obvious. (5) I felt yesterday that rioters wanted to undermine social order and create tragedy. Their purpose was to pressure</p>
<p>Police to Open Fire and Use it as an Excuse to Cause Trouble. Therefore, yesterday, I ordered each sub局 to be absolutely patient to prevent the rioters from taking advantage of the opportunity to endanger innocent civilians in the black night and create the tragedy they intended to create. At that time, our military and police force was originally sufficient to immediately resolve this riot. However, last night, the police only fired blank shots to prevent giving the rioters an excuse. The rioters, on the other hand, completely exposed their identities. If street vendors have any demands, they can petition the municipal government, the city council, or the Executive Yuan. It is not impossible to surround the police bureau or even surround the municipal government. Why destroy stores, destroy cars, block public transportation, and drag out all the machines and materials from the Gao Sheng Paper Store in Dongxinqiao and set them on fire? This is completely to expose their riot plan, endanger social order, endanger the peace of the people, and make stores afraid to open for business, using</p>
<p>A Policy of Terror to Threaten Everyone. Would ordinary street vendors dare to do all of these things? Should the government not severely deal with this kind of illegal behavior? (6) The street vendor issue has been resolved. They can set up stalls in public or private open spaces in a concentrated manner, and the street vendors have expressed satisfaction. This incident has become a riot by rioters endangering public security and endangering the people's peace. The government's responsibility is to protect the safety of people's lives and property, regardless of anyone in the city dragging people out of vehicles, throwing stones, taking things, setting fires, and other illegal behaviors. Shanghai's martial law order has not been lifted. In the past, for the convenience of the citizens, it was not strictly enforced according to martial law. In the future, if there is any damage to people's lives and property, or endangering public order, it will be dealt with strictly according to martial law.</p>
<p>No Pardon for Murder. (7) The military camps throughout the city have absolute power to control Shanghai's security. In order to protect the peace of all citizens, the government will punish unlawful riots. After 5 PM tonight, the city has been peaceful and uneventful. After the Security Command issued a bulletin on suppressing riots, no more incidents of forced shop closures or blocked traffic will be allowed to occur. Tomorrow, everyone can operate as usual, and the government will absolutely guarantee the safety of everyone's life and property. As for the municipal government's basic attitude towards the citizens, we will vigorously implement democracy. I and all the staff of the municipal government are public servants, and all the citizens of the city are our masters. The municipal government must take everyone's welfare as its own. Rioters murder and arson, endangering everyone's interests, so they must be severely punished. The government of the ruling Kuomintang is by no means comparable to the warlord era. Kuomintang members are public servants of the people and have always served the people. If any of my subordinates, whether they are civil servants or police officers, are impolite or abuse or extort money, they can report to me at any time and give instructions at any time. I will humbly accept them. Otherwise, I am not worthy of being the mayor of this city, and even less worthy of being a member of the Kuomintang. At this time of turbulent situation, in order to seek</p>
<p>Citizen Welfare and the Prosperity of Commerce Throughout the City, all policies will be based on the interests of the majority. For example, the implementation of price evaluation is because it does not hinder the interests of the majority for the sake of the interests of the minority. This is completely for the sake of the 4.5 million citizens of the city. If I do not do this, everyone can report it at any time and file a complaint with the Central Government. I am willing to accept the punishment I deserve. Therefore, if there are a few people who attempt to disrupt social order, hinder public order, and engage in riotous behavior, the municipal government cannot but take decisive action. In the events of yesterday and today, the municipal government's handling has left those attempting to riot with no excuse. And the rioters' behavior is not sympathized with by the public. From tomorrow onwards, I hope that all sectors of industry, commerce, and academia will work in factories as usual, operate in stores, study peacefully in schools, and I hope that all citizens of the city can rest assured.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>New Developments in the Near East Political Situation</h3>
<p>Just as the Four Foreign Ministers Conference had reached an agreement on the issues of Trieste and the Danube River, and the United Nations General Assembly had begun working on the issue of universal disarmament, with the Soviet Union's agreement to implement international management and oversight, various disputes have arisen in the Middle East, specifically among the Arab nations and their neighboring countries. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Ankara on the 28th, King Abdullah of Transjordan's ambition to create a "Greater Syria" has been rekindled. Saudi Arabia has expressed fierce opposition and has deployed troops into Transjordan, with reports of minor skirmishes. Simultaneously, the Secretary-General of the Greek Foreign Ministry and the Secretary-General of the Turkish Foreign Ministry have both traveled to Transjordan. Although the issue of Transjordan may seem like a small spark, due to its international context, it could escalate into an uncontrollable situation if not prevented promptly.</p>
<p>The issue of Transjordan, along with the entire Middle East and Balkans, is not merely a territorial dispute, but also an international conflict. Since the end of World War II, British influence in the Middle East and the Balkans has gradually waned. At the same time, Soviet influence in the Middle East and the Balkans has gradually increased. Unless Britain is determined to withdraw completely, it will inevitably compete with all its might. Britain's competitive moves include: first, not favoring the Jews in Palestine; second, opposing joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the Turkish Straits; third, supporting the Greek government; fourth, refusing to withdraw British troops stationed in Egypt; fifth, protecting Iranian oil fields by force; and sixth, inciting the ambitious King of Transjordan to establish a "Greater Syria." Therefore, the Transjordanian incident is merely one link in the entire Middle East and Balkan issue. When this link moves, all other links are affected. This is why the Secretaries-General of the Turkish and Greek Foreign Ministries have both gone to Transjordan. The Arab League in the Middle East was established with British assistance to appease the Arabs. However, due to the issue of Jewish immigration to Palestine, the Arabs have gradually lost their affection for Britain, and Britain can no longer utilize it. Therefore, it seeks to support the King of Transjordan in building a "Greater Syria," uniting Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and the oil fields of the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf into one entity. If this plan succeeds, the Arab nations could unite to create a great power. Greece and Turkey, due to their vested interests, would naturally support it. As for the ambitious King of Transjordan, it goes without saying that he is willing to use all his strength to realize the construction of this great kingdom.</p>
<p>Although the Arab nation once had a high level of culture in history, its culture gradually declined with the decline of its military power. Now the economy is backward, the people are ignorant, and the real power is in the hands of a few extremely autocratic desert tribal chiefs. They have supreme authority over all their land, with the power of life and death over the tribal people. Their personalities are fierce and predatory. They are the de facto representatives in parliament, and each carries two pistols in the chamber. Whenever the debate becomes heated, they do not hesitate to draw their guns, and the meeting immediately breaks up.</p>
<p>The King of Transjordan is one of the larger of these tribal chiefs. We can imagine that for such a simple-minded and violent national leader, the ideas of traditional heroes are very well developed, and he is also most easily exploited. Moreover, once ambition is aroused, and material and military supplies are received, it is difficult to rein in on the edge of the precipice. On the other hand, the leaders who oppose him have the same temperament. Therefore, as soon as the King of Transjordan's ambition was exposed, Saudi Arabia immediately declared, "It will not hesitate to crush this ambition with force," and deployed troops into Transjordan. This lively drama has now been successfully directed and has begun to be staged. When will it end?</p>
<p>The United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have all been vying for the support of the Arabs, but their methods are subtly different. The American method is to run schools, send students abroad, establish hospitals, and promote Western science and American-style democracy. Now, these individuals who have received American education have a good impression of Americans. The Soviet Union specializes in wooing the lower classes, sympathizing with them and helping them in times of trouble, thereby promoting Soviet-style democracy. The British, however, specialize in befriending the chiefs, providing them with military supplies, and encouraging their ambitions, forming deep ties with them. In a country with a very low level of public education, the American and Soviet methods are relatively slow, while the British method is the easiest to succeed. However, in times of tension, the Soviet Union can also adopt the British method.</p>
<p>We cannot help but express our deepest pity and sympathy for the Arab nation. Because it is a human tragedy when a nation is exploited, used as a puppet, commits suicide and fratricide. Such a tragedy is now not only happening in Transjordan and neighboring Arab countries, but is also taking place intensely in India, Greece, Korea, Iran, and Egypt, reminiscent of the struggles of the past in Spain. If world politicians truly have a compassionate heart and a determination to seek world peace, they should abandon their hegemonic conspiracies as soon as possible and allow the nations of the world to freely handle their internal disputes. At the same time, the leaders of all nations should prioritize the people, examine themselves, stop relying on foreign aid to seize land and cities, and resort to arms, disrupting order, driving the people, and slaughtering their own compatriots. Humanity should be rational, and only by acting rationally can true success be achieved, and the human world can live in permanent peace.</p>

<h3>On the National Assembly in the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>— Chen Ruxuan</p>
<p>The "Revised Draft of the Constitution of the Republic of China" (also known as the May 5th Constitution Draft Amendment), which was drafted based on the principles agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference, has been completed through the fastest legislative process and submitted by the National Government to the National Assembly as a basis for discussion. The full text consists of fourteen chapters and one hundred and fifty-one articles. There are many improvements compared to the May 5th Constitution Draft. For example, it adopts a proactive approach to protecting the freedom and rights of the people, removing the original phrase "not restricted except in accordance with the law"; and strictly defines the scope of central legislation restricting these freedoms, to prevent abuse of legislative power and deprivation of the people's rights. Furthermore, the members of the Legislative Yuan are to be directly elected by the people, so that local public opinion and the national legislative body are closely connected; all laws can fully represent public opinion, and the Legislative Yuan will not be bureaucratized or become an appendage of the government. The provincial governors are not appointed by the central government, but are directly elected by the people of each province; so that the local people have the freedom to choose their administrative managers. Since the provincial governors are elected by the provincial people, they are of course subject to recall by the voters; they will naturally respect the public opinion of the provincial people, in the hope of winning the support of the provincial people, and dare not act recklessly, offend the public, and destroy their own positions. Compared with the provincial governors appointed by the central government, who only seek to perfunctorily implement central laws, please their superiors, and then can boss people around, regardless of the life and death of the people, this is certainly a great improvement. The "Fundamental National Policies" chapter summarizes the major issues of the country's economy, finance, military affairs, national defense, education, and diplomacy in one place, and provides important guidelines for each, in a concise and comprehensive manner. Compared with the May 5th Constitution Draft's scattered arrangement, which focuses on one thing and loses sight of others, this is indeed a better approach. Other improvements include clearly defining the Judicial Yuan as the organ for interpreting the Constitution, making the Judicial Yuan similar to the Supreme Court of the United States as the "protector of the Constitution." Raising the status of the judiciary, unifying the power of interpretation, and preventing those who play with the law from distorting it for their own convenience is truly appropriate. Furthermore, in the chapter on territory, the May 5th Constitution Draft adopted a listing approach, including the names of all provinces and regions in the constitutional provisions; but today, with the independence of Outer Mongolia, the conversion of Taiwan into a province, and the transformation of the three northeastern provinces into nine, the constitutional provisions must be changed. Therefore, the revised draft changes to a general approach, stating "The territory of the Republic of China shall be based on its inherent boundaries," making the provisions more flexible, which is also an improved revision.</p>
<p>As for the points in the revised draft that differ from the May 5th Constitution Draft that still need to be studied, in my humble opinion, there are also several. Now, I will first discuss the two or three most important of these, conduct an analytical and comparative review, and trace the origins of their legal principles and the spirit of the system, for the perusal of those who are concerned with the Constitution. As for the merits and demerits, opinions will differ, and the reader should choose accordingly. (1) Reduction of the power of the National Assembly: The May 5th Constitution Draft stipulated that the National Assembly would be organized by representatives directly elected by the people in the national territory; while the revised draft, in addition to regional representatives, adds all the members of the central Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan, and changes the members of the Legislative Yuan to be directly elected by the people, while the members of the Supervisory Yuan are selected by the provincial and municipal councils (the May 5th Constitution Draft stipulated that both the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members were elected by the National Assembly). In this way, the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, in terms of governance, are one of the five Yuans, and in terms of political power, they are representatives of the National Assembly. When the National Assembly is adjourned, they can represent the National Assembly and supervise the government, just like a standing committee of the National Assembly. As for the functions of the National Assembly, those listed in the May 5th Constitution Draft are five: election, recall, initiative, referendum, and amendment of the Constitution; and the powers of election and recall extend to the President, Vice President, President of the Legislative Yuan, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, President of the Supervisory Yuan, Vice President of the Supervisory Yuan, members of the Legislative Yuan, and members of the Supervisory Yuan. All central laws can be initiated and subjected to referendum by the National Assembly; amendment of legislation is also within the power of initiative and referendum, because of its greater importance, it is specifically listed as a separate item. The revised draft significantly reduces the functions of the National Assembly; the powers of election and recall can only be exercised for the President and Vice President; the Presidents and members of the various Yuans are excluded; the powers of initiative and referendum are limited to amending the Constitution, and do not extend to all central laws, and the National Assembly can only exercise these powers when more than half of the counties and cities in the country can exercise the powers of initiative and referendum. According to this method, in the period after the start of constitutional government, the National Assembly is only an agency for electing the President (amending the Constitution and recall are extremely rare events). The Legislative Yuan's power to decide on all laws is not subject to any constraints or supervision. Except for the President's right to request reconsideration under certain circumstances, and the Judicial Yuan's right to declare a law unconstitutional if it conflicts with a provision of the Constitution, the National Assembly cannot demand a referendum and therefore has no right to intervene. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan is above all else. The drafters of the Constitution believe that the members of the Legislative Yuan and the representatives of the National Assembly are both elected by the people (Article 62 of the draft states that the Legislative Yuan is organized by elected members), and the members of the Legislative Yuan also serve as representatives of the National Assembly; they represent the people on the one hand and the National Assembly on the other. Therefore, the views of the two bodies will not be divergent. The laws decided by the Legislative Yuan are of course agreed to by the National Assembly. In this situation, the power of referendum need not be used. This view is too idealistic. Even if they are both elected representatives, their views are often incompatible. Even if they are members of the same party, the cabinet and parliament are often at odds. The facts show us that this is the case everywhere. If the people are not given the opportunity to express their opinions, who can guarantee that all the legal discussions of the legislative body will fully conform to public opinion? Under the five-power system, the sole responsibility of the National Assembly is to represent the people and control the government. Legislative power is the greatest of the government's powers. Although the people do not legislate themselves, they can use the power of referendum or initiative to control legislation. Now, the people cannot actually initiate or subject central laws to referendum, and they cannot exercise the power of recall over the members of the Legislative Yuan; and the National Assembly, which represents the people, does not have the power to express their opinions on their behalf. Then, wouldn't the Legislative Yuan become an institution that is self-important? If it abuses its powers and produces bad laws, there is no way to remedy it until the three-year election; the danger is indeed conceivable. In parliamentary political countries around the world, the head of government has the power to dissolve the legislature; and their parliaments themselves are mostly divided into upper and lower houses, which supervise each other and discuss issues repeatedly in order to achieve thoroughness. This is to prevent the abuses of legislative despotism. The May 5th Constitution Draft stipulated that the National Assembly has the power to recall members of the Legislative Yuan and the power to subject laws to referendum. Its intention is also here. I feel that this is indeed a point that cannot be erased. As for the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans, who also serve as representatives of the National Assembly, meeting once every six years to elect the President, it seems to be copying the established rules of France, where the members of the upper and lower houses of the National Assembly form a National Assembly to elect the President. (The only difference is that the representatives of the National Assembly in the draft, in addition to the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans, also include some regional representatives.) This method is simpler than direct election; in practical terms, there are no difficult obstacles. However, the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans are those who exercise the power of governance in the National Government; and they are those who exercise the power of government in the National Assembly. They have two qualifications and are very powerful, which is slightly different from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's theory of separate exercise of political power.</p>
<p>In summary, the National Assembly in the revised draft, in terms of organization, seems to be larger and more complex than that stipulated in the May 5th Constitution Draft; in terms of functions, it is simpler and weaker than that stipulated in the May 5th Constitution Draft. Moreover, due to the temporary absence of the powers of initiative and referendum, the Legislative Yuan has become an uncontrolled body. Because the powers of election and recall only extend to the President, it is impossible to establish any relationship or implement any guidance or supervision over the heads of the various Yuans. This National Assembly can only be regarded as an agency for electing the President. Therefore, it only meets once every six years, for a few days each time, and its task can be completed. This is very different from the May 5th Constitution Draft, which makes the National Assembly the linchpin for controlling the government. The importance of its position is completely different, which is what deserves the most attention.</p>
<h3>My Former Ambassador to the Netherlands, Dong Lin, Talks About the Political Situation in the Netherlands and the Remarkable Achievements of the New Monetary Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Former Ambassador to the Netherlands, Dong Lin, returned to the country from his post to report on his work. He arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 30th and immediately went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet with Minister Wang and Vice Minister Gan Naiguang to report on his experience as an ambassador to the Netherlands. Dong has been an ambassador to the Netherlands for almost two years, and he has suffered from rheumatism because he is not accustomed to the low and humid climate of the Netherlands. He is now being transferred to serve in the ministry. This morning, he received reporters at his residence and spoke freely about the political situation in the Netherlands, saying: Because the majority of the people in the Netherlands sincerely support the royal family, the political situation is relatively stable. At present, the Catholic Party and the Labor Party have the greatest influence in the parliament. The cabinet is jointly formed by these two parties and is very democratic. In terms of economy, the Netherlands suffered severe damage from the Germans during the war. After the war, due to political stability and the efforts of the people in reconstruction work, water and electricity equipment, production facilities, and various water conservancy facilities have been largely restored. At present, the freshwater flooded areas within the country have already begun to be cultivated, while the planting in the saltwater flooded areas still needs to be completed. At the end of the war, the Dutch also suffered from inflation. The government adopted a new monetary policy, that is, all the old currency of the people was collected into the national treasury, the illegal gains during the war were confiscated, and the income tax payable by each depositor was cleared; then, the government opened accounts with new currency of the same value, which were frozen in the national bank. The government then determined the amount of withdrawals in installments based on whether the depositor was in need of living expenses, and withdrawals were not allowed without approval. As a result of the implementation of this regulation since September of last year, the results have been remarkable within one year, speculative funds have been suppressed, and the strict implementation of the quantitative allocation system has made supply and demand adapt, and the economy has returned to normal.</p>
<p>Dong continued to talk about the Netherlands' foreign trade and the prospects for Sino-Dutch trade, saying: "The Netherlands' foreign trade is far inferior to what it was before the war due to the turbulent situation in the East Indies and the inability to restore trade with Germany. The Dutch government is now signing monetary and trade agreements with various European countries, and has signed a customs union with Luxembourg, and its foreign trade has gradually improved. As for Sino-Dutch trade, it is difficult to discuss at present due to traffic barriers, but major Dutch companies have sent representatives to Shanghai, and there will be developments once sea transportation is smooth."</p>
<p>The Ambassador then said: "Regarding the number of overseas Chinese currently in the Netherlands, there are about 1,500 people, including hundreds of sailors. The government has negotiated with the Dutch to send them back to the country as soon as possible. The Dutch water conservancy projects are world-renowned, and if hundreds of East Indian Chinese students study in the Netherlands, they should also be encouraged to return to their motherland to work."</p>
<p>The Ambassador finally emphasized that Sino-Dutch relations will definitely become more and more consolidated in the future. The Dutch people have always admired Chinese culture, and some technicians have also expressed their willingness to come to China to work. The Sino-Dutch Association, which is currently located in The Hague, is also committed to the exchange of Chinese and Dutch cultures.</p>
<h3>The French Authorities in Annam Announce Measures for the Repatriation of Overseas Chinese</h3>

<h3>Wuxi Publicly Tries "Accusation of Traitor" Expert - Yang Jiliang Actually Makes a Living by Falsely Accusing People of Being Traitors; Denies Everything in Court with Eloquent Words</h3>
<p>[Wuxi News] Yang Jiliang, (also known as Yang Jianying), a resident of No. 9 Tianji Wharf in the city, does not engage in honest work. He uses aliases such as Yang Zongying and Yang Jianying to specialize in falsely accusing people of being traitors in order to extort money. He has done this in no fewer than ten cases. The High Prosecutor's Office referred the case to the local procuratorate for thorough investigation. Yang Jiliang, knowing that his scheme was exposed, refused to accept the summons. The police posted the summons on Yang's door. Subsequently, Chief Ma ordered the police to arrest Yang for interrogation and detention. After the investigation was concluded, he was prosecuted for the crime of falsely accusing people of being traitors. Yesterday was the first public hearing by the criminal court. Yang Jiliang's testimony was cunning, and he denied everything. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 10 a.m., bailiffs escorted Yang Zongying from the detention center to the court. Yang was a burly man, wearing a dark brown cotton robe. He appeared very calm. In the waiting room, Yang's wife came to see him. Yang's wife was petite and thin. Standing opposite Yang, they were noticeably different in size and height. One was radiant and appeared not to be suffering from being charged in court, seemingly indifferent to death; the other was haggard, with a worried frown, repeatedly lamenting her helplessness. The meeting of this mismatched couple was both pitiful, laughable, and hateful. Yang Zongying then took off a gold ring (weighing about three mace) from his finger and gave it to his wife, saying that there was nothing to worry about and that there were new discoveries, etc.</p>
<p>Then, Judge Xiang Xudong took his seat in the first courtroom. Yang Jiliang admitted that he had two names, Yang Jiliang and Yang Jianying. He used to own a silk store and is now in the real estate business. He is from Sitou in the northern countryside. He had not committed any crimes before, but was once sued by Mao Yaoshan and sentenced to six months for fraud. He is appealing because he did not accept the verdict. He confessed to accusing Tong Shoupei of being a traitor, but no one else. The judge questioned him about the accusations made against Zhang Zhitong, Xu Juncai, Jiang Beizhai, Zhang Shengyi, etc., and asked how he received the provincial government's instructions. He said: "I don't know Zhang Zhitong. Xu Juncai is an old friend, so why would I accuse him? My wife, who is illiterate, received the provincial government's instructions. If I wanted to falsely accuse someone, could I change the name easily but not the address? Before I was detained, I even applied to the court for registration, because someone was using my address fraudulently. A female clerk received it and issued a receipt," etc.</p>
<p>His words were forceful and fluent. The judge had no way to refute him. After all, he was an experienced litigant. Yang also presented his self-written defense to the court. The court then ordered Yang Zongying to affix his fingerprint to the written record of his testimony. Yang received the record, read it over, and, finding no discrepancies, affixed his fingerprint. Yang was returned to custody and the hearing was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Wang Maogong's Observations on Provincial Administration – Orders to Rectify Shortcomings in Various Counties; Strict Prohibition of Vendettas and Other Illegal Activities in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Wuxi Correspondent] In order to understand the administrative situation in various counties and cities in Jiangsu Province, Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong recently personally went to various counties and cities for investigation and interviews. He first conducted investigations and inquiries along the Grand Canal through Huai'an and Xuzhou counties. He also held symposiums with party, government, military, and local figures to review the implementation of the pacification zone's administrative program and coordinate with the military to establish security. Overall, he was quite satisfied. Xuzhou and western counties were able to maintain security independently, and primary school education in rural areas quickly and generally resumed within the shortest time. However, the remaining counties were only partially controlled, and the promotion of political affairs was still ineffective. According to reports from the military and various parties, the results were relatively poor. The counties in southern Jiangsu were also uneven and failed to be implemented in a down-to-earth manner. The various shortcomings found during the inspection are specifically telegraphed to the county magistrates of each county for compliance.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Huaiyin Correspondent] After the recovery of northern Jiangsu, the primary measures were to stabilize people's livelihoods and restore local order. However, recently, the township, district and baojia chiefs in various counties have not been self-disciplined. Some extort money and abuse their power, damaging the people; others collude with communist cadres and fail to report them; others take advantage of remaining evil forces to exploit the villages; others use self-surrender and self-renewal as pretexts to extract wealth; some even hide abandoned supplies for their own use; and plot to take revenge by killing those who surrendered, affecting local security and violating the central government's policy of leniency. The Seventh District Commissioner's Office believes that the township and baojia chiefs are the people closest to the masses and are familiar with those who have gone astray. Except for important cadres or those who willingly act as accomplices to the enemy, who should be reported immediately, all others should be guided to self-renewal or directly reported, so as to clear the local area, establish security, and ensure the supplies abandoned in the recovered areas, which were extorted from the local people, should still be used for local construction or relief purposes, and should not be taken for one's own use. As for the communist army disrupting the local area and causing the masses to hate each other, it is only natural that the masses in the recovered area harbor deep resentment towards those who participated in the communist side, thinking of the past when their families were destroyed. However, they must not seek revenge privately, resulting in blood feuds. Even if the crime is deserved, they can only be listed and reported to the national law. It is strictly forbidden to kill them without authorization, which would make themselves fall into illegality. Yesterday, special orders were given to strictly warn the subordinates, and the masses or groups were allowed to report directly to the commissioner's office.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Adds Self-Defense Corps</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Suzhou Correspondent] The Suzhou urban self-defense brigade previously drew over five hundred team members from the 1st, 5th, and 7th companies and temporarily formed a training brigade. They were given three weeks of special training by the airborne troops stationed in Suzhou in order to cultivate a permanent local self-defense force. Recently, due to the approach of the winter defense period, in order to meet the needs, it is planned to set up seven directly affiliated sub-teams in the central urban area of Qizhen to strengthen self-defense forces and ensure the security of the urban area.</p>
<h3>A Farmer's Wife in Tang Village, Dangtu County, Ms. Dong, Dies Mysteriously</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Dangtu Correspondent] Tang Youhe, a resident of the 8th Bao of Tang Village, Xinta Township, Dangtu County, had a wife named Dong, who was 39 years old. She was originally married to a man named He in Xuancheng and had a son, who is now 19 years old. Later, her husband, He, died of illness, and she had no means of support. Therefore, she remarried Tang Youhe, in order to find a husband to raise her son. After living in the He family in Xuancheng for four years, Tang Youhe took Dong and her son back to Xinta Township to live. They lived a peaceful life. However, on November 15th at 9 p.m., someone suddenly knocked on the door outside, saying that they were sent by the township office. Dong opened the door and saw four people, all with painted faces. One of them said, "Grandma, why didn't you open the door?" Before Dong could answer, he stabbed Dong in the waist three times with a sharp knife, killing her instantly. At that time, her husband was out on business. Her housemate cried for help. Bao Chief Tang Youyu learned about it and reported it to the township office. The township office was closed, and after repeatedly shouting to open the door, he reported the incident to Township Head Hu. The next day, Township Head Hu, together with Township Representative Song Qingde, went to investigate and ordered the Bao Chief to provide a coffin for burial. The coffin is still in Tang Youhe's field, and has not been buried or nailed.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants in Xiashi Request Loans</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Haining Correspondent] Xiashi Town in this county is the largest wholesale distribution center for rice in Zhejiang Province. Grain from the provincial capital and various counties in eastern Zhejiang is mostly purchased here. Before the war, the annual shipment reached over one million shi. Recently, due to the shortage of funds in various stores, the amount of storage purchased is insufficient, and they feel that they are not strong enough. Once supply cannot meet demand, various counties in eastern Zhejiang will suffer from food shortages. Rice merchants specially petitioned the Xiashi Chamber of Commerce to transfer the request to the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, requesting loans from the four banks, and requesting loans against the mortgage of grain, so as to benefit grain merchants and the people's food.</p>
<h3>Mingguang Disaster Relief Center Receives Large Batch of Relief Flour</h3>

<h3>A Traitor in Tianshenggang Sentenced to Four Years in Prison</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nantong Correspondent] Sun Junying, a native of Tianshenggang, Nantong, willingly turned against the country after the fall of Tianshenggang, Nantong. From March of the 27th year of the puppet regime, he served as the vice-chairman of the Tianshenggang Maintenance Association, recruiting workers for the enemy. In July of the same year, the association was reorganized into an autonomous branch, and he continued to serve as the chairman of the branch, concurrently serving as the principal of Tianshenggang Elementary School, implementing enslavement education for the enemy puppets. At the end of the same year, he was reassigned as the Township Chief of Tianshenggang Township.

He did not leave his puppet position until February of the 31st year. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was reported by the local people, and the prosecutor of the Nantong Local Court arrested him and sent him to the prosecutor of the High Court for public prosecution.

The roadbed was solid and was an important transportation line from Luodian to Jiading. It was destroyed by the enemy puppets during the war. After the victory, because Jiading could be reached directly from the Xihu Highway, the Jialuo Highway was not noticed.

However, the Jishi Bridge on the Jing-Huang Line has not been completed on schedule due to the large project and lack of materials, so vehicles cannot pass through. Chief Ji, in order to complete the task as soon as possible, went to the Construction Section of Jing County and the Second Brigade of the Emergency Repair Project a few days ago to discuss the construction of the Jishi Bridge and the opening of the highway. It is reported that a concrete plan has been obtained. Before the bridge is built, Chen, the head of the engineering team, will submit a report to his superiors to speed up the shipment of materials.

<h3>Murderer Xia Junxian Apprehended in Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office] Xia Junxian, a cadre of the Communist army, served as the leader of an assassination squad in Taixing. He engaged in rape, plunder, and all sorts of evil deeds. On July 11 of last year, he robbed and murdered Zhu Shizhong, Zhu Shixiao, and Xia Nanqing, villagers of Zhu Xuan Township, after an extortion attempt failed. He abandoned their bodies in the fields, shocking passersby. Recently, he was tasked with infiltrating the Jiangnan area to gather military intelligence. Using the alias Xia Zi'an, he obtained a certificate from the Shanghai Pig Trade Association, falsely claiming to be a peddler from the Shenchang Pig Business. He resided at No. 61, Lane 754, Tianyao Road, Shanghai, using this as cover to travel between Suzhou and Shanghai and indulge in his desires. Meng Xun, the head of Zhu Xuan Township, 5th District, Taixian County, had repeatedly suffered illegal abuse by Xia in his hometown. Upon hearing that Xia was active in the Jiangnan area, Meng followed him and encountered Xia on the afternoon of the 27th on Shantang Street outside the Hemenguan Gate in Suzhou.

<h3>The Case of Former Haimen County Magistrate Liu Daoping is Appealed by the Jiangsu High Procuratorate for Review</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office on the 1st] Former Haimen County Magistrate Liu Daoping was accused of misconduct during his tenure. Residents of the county distributed leaflets, making tearful appeals to all sectors of society and listing eighteen counts of wrongdoing, which were reported to Chairman Chiang, Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province, and the Jiangsu High Procuratorate. After the case was filed, Liu fled to Shanghai and went into hiding. He was recently arrested by the Shanghai Garrison Command and sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for interrogation. The Jiangsu High Procuratorate has now telegraphed the Haimen Judicial Office to conduct a thorough investigation of Liu Daoping's crimes and has consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government to bring him to Suzhou for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office on the 1st] Xin Yutang, the county magistrate of Pixian County, Jiangsu Province, was previously accused of corruption and dereliction of duty by more than 14 representatives of the county's residents, who jointly filed a complaint with the Tongshan District Procuratorate.

<h3>Plea to Exempt Pudong Vegetable Stalls from Crackdown</h3>
<p>Our town is located at Qichang Zhan in Pudong. The vegetable stalls have been located beside the street for decades, and the market's vibrancy depends on them. There is very little traffic passing through this area, so they do not impede transportation at all. In July of this year, we suddenly received an order from the police bureau to move all vegetable stalls to Lane 177. This lane is a very narrow mud lane with houses only on one side, less than thirty storefronts long. There are no shelters, sewers, or other facilities. Whenever it rains, it becomes unbearably muddy, and vegetable vendors cannot set up properly. As a result, they have to hawk their wares along the streets, leading to inconsistent prices. Furthermore, with the harsh winter approaching, the ground will freeze. When it is time to go to market, the ice will melt, making it like a rainy day, causing the citizens to suffer greatly. The prosperity of the market has been greatly affected.</p>
<p>Moreover, the police bureau's purpose is to improve the appearance of the city. However, vendors selling foreign goods, cotton cloth, groceries, and other non-vegetable items are still allowed to set up on the streets, creating piles and stalls everywhere, which is very chaotic. Also, vegetable stalls at Yangjing Eighteen Jian Tang Bridge, Yangjiadu, and Huayuan Stone Bridge are still allowed to set up on the streets. Only we are being excluded. We sincerely hope that the police bureau will consider the plight of the common people and rescind the order. (Citizen Lu Haosheng)</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Public Bus Routes</h3>
<p>I recently read in your newspaper that the Public Utilities Bureau plans to open the 9th and 10th public bus routes to improve public transportation, which is very welcome. However, the reader believes that the proposed route for the 10th public bus has room for consideration. Before the war, the city's public buses ran vertically and horizontally, mainly based on actual needs. Thanks to the efforts of the authorities in the past year, most of the original routes have been gradually restored. However, the 9th public bus route from the Bund to Yangshupu is still missing. Currently, transportation in that area relies solely on the 8th tram, which is extremely crowded, and transportation is extremely inconvenient. If there is an accident or a power line is damaged, there is no means of transportation at all. Considering the length of the Yangshupu route (the entire route is one and three-quarters times the length of the route from the Bund to Zhaofeng Garden), the large population in the eastern district (nearly one million), and the severe lack of transportation, it is necessary to restore the 9th public bus route as soon as possible in accordance with the principle of improving the welfare of the citizens. The proposed route for the 10th bus: from Zhaofeng Garden via Nanjing Road to the Bund. This section already has public buses running between the Bund and Jiangsu Road. Although the terminus is different, they are very close to each other and cannot be said to be inconvenient. Moreover, there are already several tram and bus routes running side by side between the Bund and Jing'an Temple. Adding another bus on the crowded Nanjing Road will only make the road narrower and the traffic more congested. The actual need is not as urgent as in Pudong. Weighing the actual situation, I specifically appeal for the 10th route to be changed to run from the Bund to Yangshupu, which would be more in line with actual needs. (Zhou Desheng)</p>
<h3>Shangchuan Train Arbitrarily Raises Prices</h3>
<p>The price of passenger tickets on the Shangchuan train in Pudong has been increased by 100% since November 16, which is more than the increase for trams and public buses. At a time when transportation is scarce, poor merchants and travelers are bearing a heavier burden. However, I read in the Local News section of your newspaper on the 21st that Zhao Huijue, the director of the Public Utilities Bureau, reported to the Senate that the Shangchuan train's price increase had not yet been approved. This is quite surprising. I urge the Public Utilities Bureau to punish the Shangchuan train company, which only seeks profit and arbitrarily raises prices, and to reduce ticket prices to benefit the common people and maintain the government's credibility. The company should also be ordered to turn over the excess ticket revenue and donate it to charitable organizations to ensure fairness. (Gu Yingwu)</p>
<h3>Measures for Dealing with Mad Dogs</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been daily reports of mad dogs biting people in the city, causing injuries and deaths. However, the authorities have not taken appropriate measures, resulting in a worsening situation, more victims, and widespread panic.</p>
<p>I believe that to prevent mad dogs, it is necessary to first clarify responsibilities. It would be best for the Health Bureau to register pet dogs, issuing dog tags and muzzles at the time of registration, and to administer rabies vaccinations. Any unregistered dogs without dog tags or muzzles should be treated as stray dogs and killed by the police bureau. At the same time, the civil affairs office should notify each baojia (household registration unit) to jointly prevent mad dogs in order to achieve results. (Pan Bosheng)</p>
<h3>Training Public Bus Personnel</h3>
<p>Previously, a letter from Mr. Zhang Zhiyuan was published in this column, mentioning the public bus drivers arousing curses from passengers. We have now received a letter from the Transportation Section of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company Preparatory Committee stating: "The drivers of the 6th public bus line were dissatisfied with their treatment last month, and there was an incident where the vehicles deliberately lingered and slowed down in the middle of the route after departing from the starting station, resulting in several vehicles running close together. After investigation, the initiators were given appropriate punishment. As a fundamental solution, their treatment was also adjusted appropriately.

<p>Reply to Mr. Ni Shenqi: Regarding your letter inquiring about applying for an ID card, we have received a letter from the Shanghai 10th District Office stating: "This district has recently been ordered to handle household registration recording matters. All bao cadres are required to concentrate at the district office to transcribe registers and only return to the bao office for one hour each afternoon to work. When Mr. Ni goes to the bao office, it may be during the recording time. Furthermore, according to household registration regulations, an ID card can only be issued after one month of residence. Therefore, it is necessary to check the residence date to comply with the procedures. Mr. Ni's ID card receipt has been numbered Jing No. 61051 and was sent by staff on the 22nd of this month. There is absolutely no truth to the accusations of procrastination or hidden motives mentioned in Mr. Ni's letter. It is regrettable that Mr. Ni was impatient to wait for the ID card and misunderstandings arose. In addition to instructing the bao cadres and notifying all baos to simplify the procedures for applying for national ID cards as much as possible and strive for speed, the circumstances are specifically replied to."</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Zhang Guobao: Regarding your letter about witnessing the fire at Huonanmen, we have received a reply from the Shanghai Police Bureau stating: "We sent officers to investigate the scene of the incident.

<h3>Gu Weijun Synthesizes Various Opinions, Proposes Concrete Measures for Disarmament; Soviet Union's Lengthy Draft Includes Four Key Points</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 30th] The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued its meeting today to discuss the issue of arms reduction. Dr. Gu Weijun, head of the Chinese delegation, delivered a speech, synthesizing the Soviet Union's proposal and the amendments from Canada and Australia, presenting the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) Organize an international military force in accordance with Article 43 of the United Nations Charter. (2) Although the Atomic Energy Commission should continue to work in accordance with existing rules and procedures, all atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction must be prohibited. (3) Establish an international control and supervision system in accordance with the principles revealed in the Canadian and Australian amendments. (4) All countries should assist the Security Council and the Atomic Energy Commission to facilitate their work.</p>
<p>Ambassador Gu said that China believes that the arms reduction plan proposed by the Soviet Union and the amendments proposed by Canada and Australia can complement each other and do not conflict with each other. The plans of Canada, Australia, and the Soviet Union are all driven by a desire, namely, to promote peace, security, and the happiness of mankind. Any arms reduction plan must be universal, effective, and acceptable to all countries. Any plan that violates this principle should not be adopted. After careful study of the above three plans, I believe that the Soviet plan is the simplest, even too simple, and it is necessary to make some amendments to it. The amendment proposed by Canada is very useful and constitutes a concrete contribution to the Soviet plan. The Australian amendment is the same. In short, China will support all three of the above plans.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 30th] The Soviet delegation tonight synthesized all suggestions on the issue of disarmament and submitted a final draft to the Political Security Committee, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The General Assembly recognizes the need for universal arms reduction to consolidate peace and enhance international security. (2) The production of atomic energy for military purposes must be prohibited. In this regard, a control agency must be established to implement the Security Council's resolutions in this area. (3) The General Assembly acknowledges that all member states should prepare reports on their troop strength and the total number of domestic weapons and submit them to the Security Council when discussing proposals related to universal disarmament. (4) The General Assembly should call on all governments to do their utmost to assist the General Assembly in fulfilling its responsibilities in order to establish lasting peace and maintain world security. This work is of concern to the people of the world because disarmament can alleviate the heavy burden of excessive military spending, which is not needed after the war.</p>
<h3>U.S. New Plan Incorporates Elements from All Sides</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 30th] While the Political Committee continued to discuss the Soviet disarmament plan and the amendments from Australia and Canada, the United States today presented a new plan, which incorporates the main points of each of the above plans. The new plan will be presented by U.S. representative Connally at tomorrow's meeting, with four main points: The first three points must be submitted by the General Assembly to the Security Council, and the fourth point will be executed automatically by the General Assembly, including (1) The Security Council should immediately draft implementation measures for universal disarmament through international agreements; (2) The Security Council should first consider the Atomic Energy Commission's report; (3) The Security Council should consider the control of arms protection; (4) The General Assembly requests all member states to assist the Security Council and the Atomic Energy Commission in fulfilling their tasks. The plan does not involve the veto power. In fact, the U.S. delegation stated that the use of the veto power may invalidate disarmament efforts.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 30th] The United States and the Soviet Union today unanimously advocated that the United Nations should first discuss the issue of atomic energy in its universal disarmament plan, but the two countries' opinions on the principle of applying the veto power are still far apart. China, France, and Britain, together with the United States, oppose the application of the veto power to the atomic energy issue, while the Soviet Union insists that the veto power should be reserved for all issues within the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Samoa's Overseas Chinese Equality - Our Proposal Rejected After All, No Result from Debate on Revising Trusteeship Agreement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 30th Special Dispatch] The Trusteeship Committee of the General Assembly has rejected the suggestion of our representative, namely that it guarantees all member countries in today's United Nations be given equal treatment with regard to entry, travel, and residence, etc. on the Samoa Islands. After examining the sixteen provisions of the trustee agreement regarding the Samoa Islands introduced by New Zealand, the committee began to consider supplements and recommendations to the above mentioned treaty articles from other delegations. The first suggestion - the one from our delegation regarding equal rights - was rejected with a vote of seven against one. Most of the representatives abstained, and those who cast opposing votes were Australia, Canada, France, Holland, New Zealand, South Africa, etc. The suggestion regarding revising the trustee agreement also advocated that provisions regarding the rights of the Trusteeship Committee in the United Nations charter should specifically point out that it has to accept petitions for scheduled viewings of trustee regions. Another suggestion for revision from our delegation was also rejected by the committee, i.e. the suggestion that all disputes within the Samoa Islands trustee region should be handled by the Trusteeship Committee and not fall under the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 30th Special Dispatch] The respective trustee government have already asked for the right to maintain military bases in all trustee territories without needing to consult the Security Council and have gained success in this matter. Today they have also allied to reject the Soviet suggestion that it fix a hard deadline to research the trustee agreement. In revising this trustee agreement, the respective trustee governments oppose the United Nations from establishing any forceful suggestions on revising the trustee agreement. Our country's representative Liu Kai then supported the Soviet suggestion, and Yugoslavia, India, and Iraq also supported the Soviet suggestion, but the respective trustee governments all declared their opposition, so there was no result from the debate.</p>
<h3>India and South Africa's Dispute - Direct Talks Will Begin</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 30th] Regarding the problem of the Indian minority within the borders of South Africa, a suggestion jointly introduced by the delegation from France and Mexico was passed with twenty-four votes for and nineteen votes against; the suggestion advocated that South Africa and India should hold direct talks and resolve this problem before the General Assembly's next plenary session.</p>
<h3>Non-Autonomous Nationalities Should be Granted Opportunities to Convey Their Will</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 30th] The Philippines' chief representative to the General Assembly, Romulo, today introduced a new plan, asking that legal organs be given to non-autonomous people so that they can express their opinions. Britain gave support to it, but the French representatives declared their opposition to it using process-related points. First, the Philippines representative proposed to the General Assembly that the Economic and Social Council should convene international meetings on non-autonomous territories, but the British expressed their opposition, because they believe that this action will cause the United Nations to be outside of its area of activity. Romulo then gave the General Assembly's Justice Committee the new suggestion today, asking that the General Assembly urge countries that manage non-autonomous land to convene area meetings for vassal nationalities, and grant non-autonomous nationalities with the opportunity to express their traditions and will. The British representative Wood said that this new plan had no reason for opposition in terms of jurisprudence and that it may as well be unanimously passed and submitted to the Trustee Committee.</p>

According to government sources, the Prime Minister and Cripps discussed preparations for the round table conference to be held next week, but there seems to be little possibility of further amendments to the Indian independence plan. Participants in the round table conference include Indian Viceroy Wavell, Muslim League President Jinnah, Secretary Ali Khan, Indian Interim Government Vice President Nehru, Interior Minister Patel representing the Congress Party, and Defense Minister Singh representing the Sikh community.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] The correspondence exchanged between British Prime Minister Attlee and Indian Interim Government Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nehru has recently been released by the British government. Nehru initially refused the British government's invitation, arguing that continued British-Indian negotiations would delay the convening of the Indian Constituent Assembly. Attlee immediately replied, stating that the British government is willing to ensure the success of the Indian Constituent Assembly and does not intend to abandon the plans of the British Cabinet Mission. Nehru then replied with another letter, reiterating that the Congress Party was unaware of the need for continued negotiations, but stated that he would be willing to come to London if he could return to India before the opening of the Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 1st] U.S. Republican Congressman Buffett and four other members of Congress who have come to Japan for a visit met with MacArthur for two hours today. Afterwards, Buffett said that MacArthur was very pleased with the progress of the U.S. implementation program in Japan and the cooperation of the Japanese people. MacArthur told them: "The occupation of Japan does not cost American taxpayers money." This is different from the situation in Germany, where the U.S. has to supply food to the German people, which costs a lot of money. The five congressmen are scheduled to go to Yoshioka tomorrow, then to Qingdao on the 3rd, and then return to the U.S. via Okinawa, Manila, and Pearl Harbor to supplement the 1944 report on U.S. bases.</p>
<h3>Pauley's Proposed Reparations Plan Considered Favorable by the Japanese; They Claim Domestic Instability in China Makes It Difficult to Compete</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 30th] The reparations plan for Japan proposed by U.S. Reparations Commissioner Pauley has been commented on by prominent Japanese figures, who generally believe that although the plan would cause Japan to lose three-quarters of its steel and machine tools, drastically reduce its merchant ships, and completely prohibit its wartime industries, Japan's potential for trade with the Far East remains almost intact, which is unexpected. Japan's future depends on trade with the Far East. Japan's surplus industry not only guarantees its people a reasonable standard of living, but can also supply finished products to other Asian countries that cannot afford to buy American goods. Japan will especially maintain its textile industry and will continue to export cotton goods to the entire Far East. The reparations plan correctly stipulates the tonnage of Japanese merchant ships (a total of 1.5 million tons, of which 250,000 tons are specifically for trade with China and the Philippines) to facilitate Japan's trade with the Far East. On the other hand, the Japanese are convinced that China will be left with outdated and unusable equipment. The Japanese are also not saddened by the industrial equipment being compensated to China and the Philippines. There are two reasons for this: (1) They believe that even if China uses Japanese equipment, it will be difficult to compete with Japan because China's domestic situation lacks stability, which is not conducive to investment; (2) Japan's equipment is already outdated and has been excessively used during the war, and is almost worn out, so it is happy to give it away and hopes to import new equipment from the United States. In fact, the Japanese industrial community is almost impatient with the slow resolution of the reparations issue; they believe that reparations are only a small operation for Japan, and the success of the operation will ensure the future recovery of the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 30th] The San Francisco Chronicle today published an editorial supporting the recommendation of Reparations Commissioner Pauley to limit the Japanese steel industry, and also advocated that action should be taken simultaneously to develop the steel industry in China (including the Northeast provinces). It is said that the United Nations should destroy the steel and machinery production controlled by the Japanese. There is no doubt that this is a necessary step to eradicate Japan's ability to invade and to ensure that China will not continue to be threatened. Moreover, the United Nations should not only eradicate its ability to invade, but should also not be satisfied with limiting its production. Someone must take responsibility for establishing the steel industry in mainland China so that it can produce for China's industrialization. To achieve this, it is necessary to provide technical experts, machinery and equipment, and economic assistance to give the steel industry in China (including the Northeast provinces) greater production capacity. Without this active approach to complete its plan, Pauley's proposed plan would only create a dangerous industrial vacuum.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government to Establish Reparations Cooperation Association</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 1st] Because Pauley, the U.S. representative of the Allied Reparations Committee, has suggested to the U.S. government to quickly implement the removal of Japanese steel factories and machinery manufacturing facilities to be used as reparations, the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry plans to organize a "Reparations Facilities Removal Cooperation Association." This cooperation association will order local organizations to form branch associations to serve as agencies to assist the Allies in implementing the removal. In addition, in order to facilitate the handling of removal affairs, the Japanese government will establish reparations sections in the governments of Tokyo, Aichi, Kanagawa, Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Fukuoka, Gunma, and other prefectures to handle reparations affairs. The Japanese government plans to designate a special law, the "Reparations Removal Law," and submit it to the regular Diet session in late this month.</p>

<h3>How Should Japan Pay Reparations? Pauley Plan Announced; Warring Nations to Share According to Reparations List</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th, United Press] According to the recommendations of Pauley, the U.S. representative of the Allied Reparations Committee, which were announced here today, the countries that won the war against Japan will receive the majority of ships, locomotives, steel mills, and other heavy industries. In the reparations recommendations submitted by Pauley to Truman, the following list of goods will be shared by the victorious countries: 114 ships, totaling 3,611,000 tons; 30 to 40 shipyards, including three giant dry docks; 970 locomotives; 30,000 freight cars; equipment capable of manufacturing 220 locomotives, 800 passenger cars, and 4,800 freight cars per year; and approximately 600,000 machine tools. The Japanese reparations list also includes several steel furnaces capable of producing 10 million tons of steel per year, several rolling mills capable of rolling 6 million tons of steel per year, and thermoelectric and hydroelectric power plants capable of generating 2 million kilowatts. These reparations goods can be supplied to the Soviet Union and other Far Eastern countries that request a share of Japanese reparations. With its great industrial strength, the United States intends to make extremely large demands, and then transfer its gains to other countries to assist in their recovery efforts. It has not yet been decided how much each country will receive.</p>
<p>When to Start Distributing</p>
<p>Plans to convene a reparations conference to resolve these issues have stalled due to the Soviet Union's refusal to include the equipment it transported from the Northeast as part of the reparations. Pauley recommended reducing Japan's steel industry to end the reliance of Asian countries on Japan as a source of coal, iron, and steel. Pauley stated that this situation must be reversed, and that Japan must rely on Asia for the supply of pig iron ingots. As such, Japan would be prevented from regaining its war-making capabilities. Pauley also recommended: (1) All of Japan's steel ball and roller bearing manufacturing equipment should be removed to prevent it from manufacturing weapons; (2) The ships used by Japan for commercial navigation should be limited to no more than 5,000 tons each, and their routes should be limited to the islands near Japan, Korea, and China; (3) Pauley also urged action to completely restrict Japan from manufacturing or selling radios of various wavelengths in order to prevent the Japanese government from attempting to inspect overseas shortwave broadcasts; (4) Confiscate steel factories as reparations, and factories belonging to Japan's twenty largest financial groups should be confiscated first, because the equipment of these factories is more effective in terms of military organization than other factories. The Pauley reparations plan report disclosed in today's newspaper indicates that he recommended to Truman that Japan's industry be dismantled to the extent that it is only sufficient for its domestic needs. He predicted that Japan's trade in 1946 would decrease to 124 million yen, and in 1948 it would be only 39 million yen, but before 1948 there might be a trade surplus of 123 million yen. Pauley emphasized, "MacArthur's achievements are outstanding, but a clear reparations policy is still needed to transform Japan's wartime industry into a peacetime state."</p>
<p>Here is a brief summary of Pauley's plan: In terms of transportation, the tonnage of Japanese merchant ships should be reduced to the minimum amount necessary to meet needs. The total tonnage is 1.5 million tons, and the tonnage of each steel ship should not exceed 5,000 tons, with a maximum speed of 12 knots. The distribution method is that 1.25 million tons are needed for trade with the Japanese mainland, 125,000 tons are needed for trade with Korea, Dalian, Taiwan, and China, and 114 ships of 5,000 tons or larger can be used as reparations, as well as 30 or 40 shipyards.</p>
<p>Japan Still Retains Shipyards</p>
<p>Ten large shipyards and twelve small ones. In terms of textiles, Japan still has 2,108,000 spindles and 133,000 looms, but in order to maintain its own economy, it still needs 3 million spindles and 150,000 looms. Its cotton products are used to pay for imported cotton. Silk should be exempted from reparations, but land used for growing food should not be used for growing mulberry trees. In terms of fisheries, because Japan needs food, fisheries are exempt from reparations, but Japan should be prevented from monopolizing and plundering fish in the seas of its neighboring countries such as Korea and China. Regarding machine tools, Pauley's plan states that the tool problem is the central issue in reducing Japan's war potential. The list should be reduced to more than 175,000 units, and its potential for producing new machine tools should not exceed 1,000 units per year. A total of 600,000 units should be dismantled and removed. All items that contribute to the production of munitions will be dismantled and removed.</p>
<p>Regarding the Steel Sector</p>
<p>Pauley's plan states that Japan's blast furnace production should be limited to 500,000 tons per year, and the production of pig iron ingots should be limited to 2.25 million tons per year, which is contrary to the British view that Japan should have more steel production. Pauley's plan will force Japan to import 1 million tons of pig iron each year, thereby forcing it to rely on the countries it previously enslaved. Japan can maintain a steelmaking capacity of 1.5 million tons per year, and all other equipment should be transferred for reparations. Regarding railways, Japan's annual locomotive production should be limited to 22 units, passenger cars should be limited to 800 units, and freight cars should be limited to 4,800 units. For reparations, there are 900 steamships, 70 electric locomotives, 30,000 freight cars, and factories that can produce 850 locomotives per year. Regarding chemicals, this basic military industry should be limited to the production of fertilizers necessary for domestic food production, so that Japan no longer relies on importing phosphate fertilizers from the Pacific region. Nitric acid production equipment with an annual output exceeding 10,250 tons should be removed immediately, so that equipment with an annual production capacity of 240,000 tons of nitric acid can be used for reparations. Japan should retain a nitric acid production capacity of 300,000 tons, and factories should use 450,000 to 500,000 tons of production equipment for reparations. All asphalt distillation plants and factories that manufacture artificial ivory should be removed, just like all</p>
<p>Alcohol and Gasoline Factories</p>
<p>Except for biogas plants, because the plant has been approved to be converted into the manufacture of ammonia. Regarding power plants, Japan has a total of 28,000 power plants with a total electricity production of 4 million kilowatts, half of which should be removed. The number of hydroelectric plants that should be removed for reparations has not yet been determined and is currently under investigation. A portion of the dynamic plants can be used for distilling seawater to solve Japan's salt shortage. Regarding petroleum, all synthetic oil plants should be removed except for the five that are necessary for the manufacture of nitric acid fertilizers. All oil refineries with a daily refining capacity of more than 40,000 barrels, as well as 10 million barrels of oil in storage, should be removed for reparations. Pottery manufacturing plants and various handicrafts, such as cultured pearls, should be excluded, along with silk, tea, glass, cement, coal, wood, various foods, toys, textiles, seafood, paper, fur, rubber, various electric lamp equipment, etc., as Japan's exports, because the above-mentioned items are Japan's main exports during peacetime.</p>
<h3>French Political Situation Still Turbulent; The Three Major Parties Each Have Their Own Merits; General de Gaulle May Make a Comeback</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 30th] Representatives of the French Socialist Party and the Communist Party held a meeting here to exchange plans for participating in the future government. The details of the meeting are unknown. However, according to a communiqué issued by the two parties, "At today's meeting, the representatives of the Socialist Party asked the Communist Party how many seats it wants to hold in the future government in order to implement its policy plan, and asked the Communist Party to inform them of the important measures stipulated in the party's policy plan and its administrative methods. The Communist Party representatives immediately answered them one by one and raised the issue of close contact between the president, the speaker of the National Assembly, and the speaker of the Senate of the French Republic. Finally, it was decided that the information exchanged at today's meeting will be forwarded by the representatives of the two parties to their respective parties."</p>
<p>According to political observers, it can be seen from this communiqué that the Communist Party attempted to persuade the Socialist Party to abandon its demand that the speaker of the National Assembly should be held by former Finance Minister Auriol, but the Socialist Party representatives in the National Assembly were very cold to this and believed that only the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party could make a decision on this matter. The meeting will be held on December 3, when the candidate for the speaker of the National Assembly can be determined. In addition, many political veterans in the Radical Socialist Party have not yet expressed their opinions. The Communist Party occupies 182 of the 618 seats in the National Assembly. Even with the support of the 101 seats of the Socialist Party, it still needs the cooperation of the 43 seats of the Radical Socialist Party to maintain an absolute majority. The Popular Republican Party occupies 172 seats in the National Assembly. Adding some non-partisan seats, it has not abandoned its request for the presidency. Once it obtains a favorable opportunity, it will propose Bidault as a presidential candidate. In addition, some people in the Popular Republican Party also advocate that during the transition period, the interim government should be temporarily organized by Finance Minister Schuman, who will focus on financial recovery and limiting public expenditures. The political community attaches great importance to this plan and generally believes that this method can enable the government to take beneficial actions before the president is elected in mid-January next year.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 30th] Amid the various parties' efforts to form a new cabinet, the possibility of de Gaulle, the leader of Free France, being recalled to the political stage to lead a "National Unity Government" is increasing in the political community here. de Gaulle has been living in seclusion in his residence by the Somme River, 100 miles from here, and has long been out of political relations since the referendum on the new draft constitution on October 13. de Gaulle has not actively participated in the current fierce party struggles and has clearly stated that he has no intention of doing so.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Secret Oration; Brutal Ambitions Unveiled; Washington Releases Shocking Nazi Documents</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] The U.S. War Crimes Reporting Bureau today announced shocking Nazi documents, containing Hitler's secret oration to Nazi generals in his mountain villa in Obersalzberg in 1939, two years before the invasion of the Soviet Union. Hitler listed Stalin, Mussolini, and himself as "the only three major politicians in the world." Emperor Hirohito was listed as "weak, cowardly, and hesitant." These remarks were made on the eve of the German-Soviet Pact, that is, ten days before Hitler's invasion of Poland. Hitler declared: He intended to work with Stalin temporarily, "to discuss the redistribution of the world." And said: "Only Stalin and I have far-sighted vision." It is reported that the document was submitted to the Nuremberg International Tribunal, but not as part of the trial record. Hitler encouraged his subordinates to brutally attack Poland, saying that Nazi power lies in "our swiftness and cruelty." Genghis Khan killed millions of women and children with one person's will, and was pleased with it. History respects him as a great founder of the country. "We must take Japan into account. I will give Japan a whole year to decide, but Japan is like the last Czar, weak, cowardly, and hesitant. If there is a revolution, it may be overthrown. The current opportunity is better than ever. The only thing I fear is that Chamberlain or other pigs will come forward and propose a plan to me or seek to change my mind." Opinions of American beauty experts</p>

<h3>US Authorities Announce Establishment of First Permanent National Defense Force: Continuing Wartime Missions, V2 Missile Test Successful</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 30th] Government authorities have announced the establishment of the first permanent national defense force to continue the missions of the wartime national defense force. This organization will include atomic warfare defense plans. Its tasks will include handling serious domestic disturbances, disaster relief, domestic security, and organizing passive defense mechanisms to provide rescue work in the event of enemy bomb or rocket attacks.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st Dispatch] Last week, a V-2 controllable missile was test-launched from White Sands, New Mexico, successfully ascending to an altitude of 63.5 miles. The missile contained special, excellent machinery, which was installed by the Army Air Corps.</p>
<h3>US Coal Miners' Strike Causes Significant Losses to Production Industry; Even Miners in the Ruhr Region of Germany React</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] The government today decided to record individual fines for coal miners during the strike period, from one to two dollars per day, to be deducted after work resumes. This money will go to the medical fund of the Mine Workers Union, still managed by the union. However, this decision has gradually extinguished hopes of resolving the strike outside of court. The lawyers representing the Mine Workers Union and its president, Lewis, are not discouraged by this move and have formulated a new strategy to engage in legal battle with the government at the continued hearing on Monday. If they fail in federal district court, they will appeal to the circuit court of appeals. During the appeal period, they can avoid execution of penalties for contempt of court. Private mine owners of the Southern Coal Producers' Association are scheduled to meet here on Monday because Chairman Peek announced he was willing to negotiate all conditions, including wages and working hours, with Lewis, or else he may be removed from his position. The strike of 400,000 miners nationwide has lasted for ten days, and 100,000 steel mill and other workers have been laid off as a result. Another 167,000 people have been placed on weekend leave due to a lack of fuel in factories. According to a report from the American Iron and Steel Institute, the coal miners' strike has reduced steel ingot production by 500,040 tons this week. This amount could be used to manufacture 3.5 million household refrigerators or 200,000 automobiles. The total output lost due to strikes last year has reached 12.35 million tons. Furthermore, according to Steel magazine, the coal miners' strike has greatly reduced steel production rates, impacting the entire national industrial economy. If the stalemate is not broken soon, it will cause endless troubles. According to an Idaho telephone report, sugar factories will lose 11 million pounds of production if they do not receive sufficient coal allocations. Far away in Germany, the coal miners of the Ruhr region have also reacted to the American coal miners' strike. According to an Essen telegram, some German miners wish the American miners well in improving their working conditions, while other Germans fear that the American strike will reduce the amount of relief supplies shipped to Germany, forcing them to tighten their belts again. At the same time, the US Department of the Interior announced that it is currently negotiating to transport natural gas from the Southwest to the coal-scarce areas of the East using large and small pipelines.</p>
<h3>Pearl Harbor Attack Case Nears Completion, Trial for Abuse of Prisoners of War Begins; International Tribunal Enters Final Stage</h3>
<p>[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 1st] The Far East International Tribunal has been in session since April of this year and has now been underway for eight months, currently examining the Pearl Harbor attack. Former US Combined Fleet Commander Richardson testified on the 25th of last month, stating: (1) The Japanese Navy had been plotting the attack on Pearl Harbor for ten years, and its strategy was centered on aircraft carriers. On the day of the attack, December 8th, the ratio of American to Japanese aircraft carriers was six to ten. (2) Japan violated treaties by secretly arming the islands under its mandate in the South Pacific. (3) The Japanese consulate in Hawaii had been under orders from the Japanese Navy to become a spy organization. After this important testimony, the examination of the Pearl Harbor attack has come to a conclusion. During the examination of this issue, Japanese international law scholars' wartime papers claiming that "the attack on Pearl Harbor was not illegal, but an act of self-defense" were presented and refuted, as well as sophistical arguments by Japanese statesmen at the time of defeat. On the 27th, the trial for the abuse of prisoners of war began, with various witnesses detailing the horrific conditions in prisoner-of-war camps. Thus, the trial is gradually entering its final stage. Chief Prosecutor Keenan flew back to Washington on the 28th to report on the progress to the authorities and to receive further instructions.</p>

<h3>Rioters Continued to Cause Trouble Yesterday; Authorities Determined to Suppress Violence and Restore Order; Any Further Transgressions Will Be Severely Punished; All Stores on All Roads to Resume Business Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Huangpu Branch Bureau's handling of street vendors the day before yesterday caused a disturbance. After the detained vendors were released, things had settled down. However, starting in the afternoon, some troublemakers took the opportunity to create disturbances, and the disputes escalated. Yesterday, the aftereffects continued, causing most stores on all roads to close. However, by 5 p.m., the situation had gradually stabilized. The mayor gave a special broadcast to the citizens last night (see page 2). After persuasion from the authorities, the stores have decided to resume normal business today, and public order can be ensured without worry. Furthermore, according to a police bureau announcement, the bureau has submitted to the city government a proposal to remove restrictions on the types of street vendors in each district. Private and public vacant lots in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts will be allowed to be used for concentrated business operations.</p>
<p>Continuous Disturbance from Dawn to Dusk</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the situation was relatively stable, and traffic was normal. Only a few pedestrians were standing in the rain in front of the Huangpu Branch Bureau. However, starting at 7 a.m., rioters formed small groups, ranging from two or three hundred people to several dozen, and went to various food markets to stop business operations. Then they scattered to various parts of the city, forcing stores to close. Many stores were vandalized for closing slightly late.</p>
<p>Around 9 a.m., the crowds gathered in front of the Huangpu Branch Bureau became larger and larger. It so happened that the Lao Bei Men Daxin Fresh Fruit shop was newly opening yesterday and set off firecrackers. The crowds mistook the sound for gunfire, and the order broke down. The police immediately took emergency measures. As the crowds of over a thousand people fled, some unscrupulous elements vandalized over forty stores along MinGuo Road, YanHai Road, and FuYou Road. Stores in the Nanshi area were all closed. At the same time, two or three hundred rioters were found on Fuxing Road, forming groups and causing disturbances. On Moore Road, rioters attempted to seize a police officer's handgun, injuring two pedestrians.</p>
<p>Starting at 9:30 a.m., rioters also did their best to stop traffic, vandalizing and looting various means of transportation. At the intersection of Tongfu Road and Fuxing Road, rioters rushed into a No. 3 public bus, drove the passengers off the bus, and smashed the glass windows. At the same time, a group of rioters in the Hongkou district caused trouble at the North Railway Station in the Binshan Road area.</p>
<p>At 9:40 a.m., rioters caused trouble at the Jinmen Grand Theater on Fuxing Road and forced stores to strike. At the same time, public buses at Yidingpan Road and Jinling East Road were all blocked.</p>
<p>Around 10 a.m., near the North Station, rioters forced stores to strike. On Wuchang Road, Sichuan Road, and Jinling East Road in the Hongkou area, rioters fired guns to show their force.</p>
<p>At 11 a.m., at Yunnan South Road, North Zhejiang Road, and Huaxing Road, rioters shouted slogans and forced stores to strike. Guard police officer No. 6297 at Lao Bei Men in the Yimiao district was shot and wounded by rioters, and one pedestrian was injured.</p>
<p>At this time, the situation around the Huangpu Branch Bureau was still stable. However, at 11:45 a.m., someone fired a shot at the bureau from the third floor of the Zhonghui Building behind the Huangpu Branch Bureau. Someone inside a building near the Huangpu Branch Bureau fired three shots in a row at the bureau, fortunately without injuring anyone. The police fired warning shots and immediately began searching, but found nothing, and the situation suddenly tightened.</p>
<p>At the same time, on Xinjiang Road in Zhabei, there were over two hundred rioters. At the Lao Chenghuang Temple in Nanshi, there were over seven hundred rioters, forcing stores to strike.</p>
<p>After 1 p.m., over four hundred unscrupulous elements riding in trucks engaged in incitement everywhere and intercepted two public buses, No. 2, No. 353 and No. 3, No. 357, and a General Staff Headquarters vehicle, No. 32018, forcing the drivers to drive to the racetrack and claiming that the mayor would be speaking at the racetrack. They were then dispersed. At this time, the rioters vandalized the glass windows of the Grand Bright Cinema, the Xiende Photo Studio, and the facades of the Carlton Apartments along the way. The police arrested dozens of people, but released them after questioning.</p>
<p>At 3:05 p.m., over a hundred rioters gathered at the Fujian Road Telephone Company, holding national flags and vandalizing trams.</p>
<p>Starting at 4:15 p.m., the situation at the Huangpu Branch Bureau suddenly deteriorated again. Rioters dragged the furniture and doors from the already vandalized Gaoshengda Paper Company to the road and set them on fire, preventing the fire brigade from extinguishing the fire. Over a thousand people gathered, and the police fired again. A stray bullet injured one plainclothes police officer, and two rioters were injured. At this time, three armored vehicles from the Special Operations Company of the Garrison Command arrived to strengthen security, and large teams of military police and mounted patrols also arrived. The crowds near Henan Road were dispersed, but over a thousand people were still gathered in front of Gaoshengda on Fujian South Road, blocking traffic.</p>
<p>At 5:30 p.m., representatives from the crowd, Wei Boshun, Shen Shiqi, and Lu Songfu, approached the Huangpu Branch Bureau to negotiate, saying that four street vendors were still being detained and requesting their release. After being met by Chief Du, they were allowed to inspect the detention center, but there were no street vendors being detained. After the three representatives explained this to the crowd, the crowd dispersed, and the sky was gradually darkening.</p>
<h3>Mayor Convenes Emergency Meeting to Discuss Strengthening Public Order; Disturbance Reported to Chairman</h3>

In addition to ordering the police authorities to maintain calm, they also decided to strictly investigate the troublemakers last night and punish them according to the law. In addition, they discussed with Xuan Tiewu how to strengthen public order in the city. If unscrupulous elements take the opportunity to cause trouble, attempting to create unrest in the city, strict measures will be taken. It is reported that Mayor Wu continued to convene the aforementioned individuals at his official residence around 6 p.m. yesterday to discuss how to protect the city's stores and business operations and prevent troublemakers from causing disturbances. At the same time, he advised all stores to open for business as usual and not close their doors for any reason.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu told our newspaper reporter that the situation of the city's disturbance had been reported to Chairman Chiang, and the central government has not yet expressed any opinion on the matter so far. This matter is a local event and should be handled by the local government, but due to the relationship of the situation, it was reported to the central government. Furthermore, according to city government sources, Director Xuan had sent a telegram to the central government for instructions at 10 a.m. yesterday, and after the city government meeting, he requested instructions again.</p>

Third, the authorities must immediately order a fair punishment for those responsible for the inappropriate measures. The government authorities must not shirk their responsibility for any death or injury of the people. Fourth, organize an investigation committee from all sectors of society regarding the course of this tragic incident and immediately publicize the complete truth to the citizens.

<h3>Garrison Command Issues Proclamation; Emergency Measures Implemented; Any Further Riotous Actions Will Be Killed Without Exception</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Songhu Garrison Command, in order to suppress violence, quell unrest, and maintain public order, implemented emergency measures and issued a proclamation at 5 p.m. yesterday. The original text reads: "It has been found that the city police bureau was ordered to rectify traffic in the central district of the city and to ban street vendors in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts. As a result, rioters took the opportunity to incite and gather crowds to cause disturbances, even vandalizing stores, forcing businesses to close, attacking vehicles along the way, obstructing traffic, and even shooting and injuring people and causing arson. In terms of their actions, the problem is no longer just about street vendors. The entire situation involves rioters taking advantage of the situation to harm the city's public order. In this martial law area, and during the winter defense period, this command cannot tolerate the suppression of violence and the protection of the people's livelihoods. It has ordered the city's military police to be on strict alert. If rioters again vandalize stores, damage traffic, shoot guns, or cause arson, they will be killed without exception. It is hoped that the people of the city will live in peace and security and not have any doubts. This proclamation is hereby issued." At the same time, the police headquarters had already instructed the Lao Zha and Huangpu branch bureaus yesterday morning: "Anyone who uses violence to force stores to strike or force vehicles to stop, shall be arrested immediately. If they resist with guns, they may be shot and killed on the spot, without exception. The victims of the crimes must be immediately ordered to provide a detailed report of the crimes."</p>
<h3>Street Vendor Representatives Visit the Mayor; Declare No Transgressions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At 10 a.m. yesterday, Zheng Zhizhang, Zhou Yizhong, Ren Jiansheng, and Chen Xiangshui, representatives of street vendors in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts, went to the City Council to state that the actions of surrounding the Huangpu Branch Bureau and vandalizing companies and stores on Nanjing Road the day before yesterday were absolutely unrelated to the street vendors. They were accompanied by Secretary-General Xiang of the City Council to visit Mayor Wu at his official residence. The four representatives also stated to the mayor that they had not taken any action other than petitioning the City Council the morning before yesterday. The surrounding of the Huangpu Branch Bureau and the wanton vandalism of stores in the afternoon were definitely not done by street vendors. Mayor Wu expressed his appreciation for the frank statements of the four representatives and promised to do his best to find public and private vacant lots for them to continue their business operations. The four also represented all the street vendors in the two districts and wrote a written statement, the original text of which is as follows: "We are the representatives of the street vendors in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts. At 11 a.m. yesterday, we petitioned the City Council, and the City Council called the City Government. The City Government notified the Huangpu and Lao Zha branch bureaus to release all the street vendors and, with the City Council, we were told the City Government had allowed us to set up stalls in public and private vacant lots. As for the disturbances in front of the Huangpu Branch Bureau and the vandalism of stores, cars, and trams everywhere in the afternoon, they are absolutely unrelated to us street vendors. [Signed] Zheng Zhizhang, Zhou Yizhong, Ren Jiansheng, Chen Xiangshui, December 1, 1946."</p>

<h3>Xu Jiqing·Du Yuesheng Advise Stores of All Kinds to Return to Normal; Livelihood of Street Vendors Being Properly Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] City Chamber of Commerce Chairman Xu Jiqing told our newspaper reporter at 9 p.m. last night: At 6 or 7 p.m. last night, order had greatly improved, and many stores had opened for business. The authorities have now taken effective measures, and it is believed that everything will be fine today. As for the livelihood of street vendors, the government is determined to find a solution. The main reason for the ban in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts is that the population is too dense and they are important transportation routes. As for remote areas, there is no intention to ban them. As for compensation for the losses of stores in the chaos, it is difficult to talk about it for the time being. Furthermore, this disturbance and vandalism is no longer a street vendor issue and obviously has another background. Business people must clearly distinguish and think carefully in this situation, be calm, and not be incited. Yesterday morning, some shops on Nanjing Road and Fujian Road were not closed, probably because they did not fully understand the truth. It is hoped that after this advice, they can immediately return to normal and jointly maintain order. As for local public order, the municipal authorities are responsible, and businessmen do not need to be alarmed by alarmist remarks, etc.</p>
<p>Another Report: Shanghai Local Association Chairman Du Yuesheng made a statement on the street vendor issue yesterday, saying: "Yesterday, the situation fluctuated due to the street vendor issue. By today, almost all prosperous areas have been forced to close, which is a rare chaos. Speaking of the causes of this matter, on the surface, it is about the livelihood of street vendors, but in reality, it is a serious economic problem. This is too far to say, so let's not talk about it for now. The municipal authorities have taken emergency measures to maintain public order, which is very proper. After consultations, the location of stalls can also be resolved. This issue has come to an end. It is hoped that all industries in the city will return to normal business as usual immediately, and the municipal authorities will definitely provide effective protection without hesitation. Furthermore, the banning of street vendors is actually for the purpose of cleaning up the city, smoothing traffic, and seeking public welfare. As for the livelihood of street vendors after the ban, we deeply feel the difficulty and express our sympathy. Before this dispute occurred, the parties concerned were already discussing and planning. The authorities were not using the ban as the final solution."</p>

<h3>A Crowd Shouts to Burn Again · Shop Assistants Kneel and Beg, but to No Avail · Gao Sheng Great Paper Store Completely Burned Down · Police Open Fire, Injuring Three</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Gao Sheng Great Paper Store, located at 250 Jinling Road, was previously destroyed by a mob during the disturbances of the other day, with the paper from the store dragged onto the road and burned, as reported in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. Yesterday morning, as the situation seemed relatively calm, the store staff hired people to begin repairs and erected a bamboo fence in front of the store. Unexpectedly, around 3 PM, a mob gathered around the store, and chaos erupted again. Someone in the crowd shouted, "Burn it again!" and over a thousand people responded in unison. They then tore down the remaining paper from the store that hadn't been burned the other day, along with the door panels, display counters, and the newly erected bamboo fence, and burned them all, creating a raging fire. At that time, firefighters arrived to put out the fire as the flames shot high into the air, but were blocked by the mob and unable to turn on the water hoses. Traffic was completely blocked, and the noise was deafening. The fire continued to burn until 6 PM without being extinguished. One of the store staff members knelt on the ground to beg for mercy, but the mob completely ignored him. All of the store's assets were completely destroyed in the blaze. The police then opened fire to disperse the crowd. One person was seriously injured, and another lightly injured during the chaos. An undercover police officer was also injured. It is reported that the military and police authorities have arrested one person who directed the arson and are currently interrogating him severely. As for the report in yesterday's paper that boiling water was poured down, the store has stated that this is inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Surprised and Delighted · Under an Atmosphere of Tension · Congratulations on New Marriages Everywhere</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the calendar, yesterday was an "auspicious day" and also a Sunday, so many people chose this day to hold engagements and weddings. Although the entire city was shrouded in an atmosphere of immense desolation, the happy events of the newlyweds were not affected in the slightest. Yesterday afternoon, this reporter drove to locations such as Kang Rong, International, Jin Long, Wan Xun Hall, East Asia You Yi Lou, and the New Life Clubhouse. Everywhere, the halls were adorned with "Double Happiness" characters, and guests were constantly arriving to offer congratulations. In stark contrast to the streets, where traffic was cut off, guards stood watch, and stores were closed, this was a completely different world. They and their partners are truly blessed!</p>
<h3>Yesterday Evening, the City Council Announced · The Handling of the Street Vendor Case · The Street Vendor Problem Has Been Resolved Satisfactorily · Three Points of Advice Proposed for Speedy and Proper Settlement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Council has issued the following statement regarding the handling of the street vendor problem, including its progress and opinions: It has been found that the Municipal Government Police Bureau, in order to facilitate traffic and improve the appearance of the city, prohibited street vendors from setting up stalls in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts. The police sub-bureaus of these two districts strictly enforced this prohibition, detaining many street vendors. On the morning of November 30th, street vendor representatives Zhou Yizhong, Liu Huashan, Bao Guizhi, Zheng Zhizhang, and 24 others gathered at the City Council to appeal. These representatives then made two oral requests: (1) Immediately release the detained street vendors to prevent them from suffering from hunger and cold. (2) Delay the implementation of the prohibition or find alternative business locations for them to maintain their livelihoods. Secretary-General Xiang Changqu received the representatives and immediately contacted Mayor Wu by telephone to report the situation. Mayor Wu replied that the detained street vendors could be immediately released by the two sub-bureaus and that he would consider finding alternative locations for them to operate in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts. The representatives were satisfied upon hearing this and requested that the City Council, considering their livelihoods, continue to negotiate with the Municipal Government before they departed. At 3 PM (November 30th), during a meeting of the chairpersons of various committees to discuss routine cases, Councilors Tang Shichang and others, due to the Huangpu sub-bureau prohibiting the delivery of food and clothing to the detained street vendors, causing them to suffer from hunger and cold, and the beating of street vendor family members, considered the situation to be serious. They proposed a temporary motion, which was resolved by sending Councilors Tang Shichang, Zhu Wende, and Wang Xianqing to investigate the truth and act accordingly. Shortly after 4 PM, more than ten street vendor representatives, accompanied by the family members of the detained street vendor Ji Xi'en and Ji Zhennian, came to the Council to state that Ji Zhennian had been beaten and injured while delivering food. They were informed that councilors had already been sent to investigate. The vendors then left. Previously, on November 14th, the City Council received a petition from street vendors in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts and, in accordance with the Council's First General Assembly Resolution No. 3 (Method Clause 2, to re-designate street vendor areas on the principle of not hindering the appearance of the city and not hindering traffic), requested the police to investigate and respond. At that time (5 PM on the 30th), a reply also arrived, stating: "In consideration of the livelihoods of the street vendors, this bureau has submitted a request to the Municipal Government for a slight accommodation, allowing the street vendors to choose public or private open spaces within the two districts to operate in a concentrated manner and has instructed the relevant sub-bureaus accordingly." The City Council believes that the police bureau's response has accommodated the vendors' requests and immediately forwarded the letter to the vendor representatives that evening. As for the gathering of crowds surrounding the Huangpu sub-bureau at the afternoon of the 30th, hoping to disrupt public order, and the destruction of cars and shops by the mob in the evening, the representatives Zhou Yizhong, Zheng Zhizhang, Ren Jiansheng, and Chen Tongqian stated to the City Council (at noon on December 1st) that no street vendors participated in these events. They also stated that they are satisfied with the police bureau's response and measures. Therefore, the street vendor problem has been resolved. As for the mob surrounding the police sub-bureau on the 30th, the destruction of cars and shops along the way, and the continued coercion of shops to close on the morning of the 1st, the authorities believe that there are unruly elements taking advantage of the situation to disrupt the mourning and that it was clearly not done by street vendors. The Council Speaker and Councilors Tang, Zhu, and Wang personally went to the scene of the incidents to investigate and strongly urged the Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to handle the matter. The Council believes that the following points should be handled separately in the aftermath:</p>
<p>(1) Please request the Municipal Government to designate open spaces within the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts, in accordance with the resolution of the City Council, to allow street vendors to register and set up stalls and to return the goods and equipment confiscated from the street vendors in order to allow them to actively make a living and reduce their losses. The prohibition of street vendors in other districts that have not been banned should be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>(2) If the Huangpu sub-bureau has indeed prohibited street vendor family members from delivering food and clothing and has committed unwarranted beatings, it is a violation of humanitarian principles. The superiors should investigate and deal with the matter in accordance with the law to demonstrate the government's respect for the legitimate rights of the people.</p>
<p>(3) As for the spreading of rumors, disrupting the market, and coercing business closures, it is clear that a small number of unruly elements have other intentions. In addition to supporting each other and maintaining order, the citizens of the city have the right to demand that the Municipal Government and the military and police authorities do their utmost to maintain law and order and protect businesses. We make this solemn announcement and hope that all citizens will not easily believe rumors and alarm themselves during this time. In particular, we hope that shops in all districts will immediately resume normal business hours so that social order can be restored to normal as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>The Disturbance Can Be Quickly Quelled · Citizens Need Not Be Alarmed · Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reporter learned last night that the Garrison Headquarters would issue a notice to enforce martial law in order to suppress the violence and restore order. He specially visited Commander Xuan at the Garrison Headquarters, who received him and issued a statement, saying: After the establishment of the Garrison Headquarters last year, it was reported to the highest authorities and approved to declare this city a martial law area. This martial law order is still in effect. In the spring of this year, in order to facilitate the night travel of citizens, the curfew was lifted, but this did not mean that the martial law order was cancelled. This time, unruly elements have caused disturbances in this city. The Garrison Headquarters could have declared special martial law, but in order to avoid inconvenience to the people of this city, who are numerous, it had to proceed with caution. However, in order to eliminate violence, maintain the security and order of this city, and curb the spread of chaos, it had to take appropriate measures and severely punish illegal violence. There are strong police forces deployed in all parts of the city, which are sufficient to suppress the riots and protect the merchants and people. There is absolutely no need to worry about security. It is believed that after the Garrison Headquarters issues the notice and implements it earnestly, the disturbance can be quickly quelled. He hopes that all merchants and people in the city will live and work in peace and not alarm each other.</p>

<h3>Talking About Police Administration in the Midst of Winter Defense</h3>
<p>— Special Article from This Newspaper</p>
<p>Since Shanghai opened as a port, under the operation of international capital, it has superficially become a prosperous metropolis, displaying its superior position. However, the residents from all directions are of mixed quality, so from the side of the metropolis, it is actually a den of vice. All acts of deception, plunder, swindling, drug trafficking, murder, and robbery can be found here. Especially in the past during the concession period, many criminals often acted recklessly under the protection of foreigners, using the concessions as a shield.</p>
<p>According to the police bureau's report, there were a total of 19,963 criminal cases in the year after the victory, averaging 547 cases per day. This is an alarming number, and maintaining Shanghai's security is not an easy task. At the same time, the more developed material civilization is, the more cases of fraud and deception there are. The precise planning and swift action make it even more difficult for the security bureau to be responsible for maintaining order. Therefore, it has to adopt newer prevention and control techniques and institutions, such as wireless radio patrol cars, which have appeared in Shanghai one after another. Shanghai's police administration has been advancing along this historical path.</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting colder. In the northwest wind, the poor can't stand the cold and hunger even more. Criminal behavior is more common than in warmer weather. They take advantage of the cold night when most citizens are hiding in their warm beds, and the rustling of the wind drowns out the sound of their actions. They use stealing and looting to solve the problem of hunger and cold. The annual winter defense is arising in response to the situation. This year's winter defense has already begun. On cold and snowy nights, the police officers will intensify their work even more.</p>
<h3>Evolution of the Shanghai Police Bureau</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Police Bureau was initially called the Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau. It was reorganized and established on July 22nd, 1927, from the former Songhu Police Department. On July 1st, 1930, it was renamed the Shanghai Public Security Bureau according to the regulations of the City Organization Law. On January 1st, 1947, it was renamed the Shanghai Police Bureau. The evolution can be divided into four stages:</p>
<h3>Patrol and Baojia Bureau</h3>
<p>In the past, Shanghai County set up positions such as county sheriff and patrol inspector to be responsible for patrolling and arresting thieves and governing traitors. These official titles continued to be used in the early Qing Dynasty, but the number of personnel was limited, so there was no administrative efficiency to speak of. It was not until after the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising that the Qing government intensified its efforts to rectify local administration, promulgated the Baojia Regulations, promoted the Baojia system, and established the Patrol and Baojia Bureau. The bureau was established with a chief patrol officer appointed by the Shanghai Daotai to manage patrol and Baojia affairs inside and outside the city. The main bureau was initially located at Chenxiang Pavilion in the city center and later moved to Changpingcang next to the county government. Nine branch bureaus were subsequently set up in the east, south, west, north, and outer parts of the city, including Beixinjing, Yinxianggang, Hongkou, and Pudong. The personnel in the bureaus were assigned from the garrison military camps and were all under the jurisdiction of the main bureau. At that time, the chief patrol officer of the bureau issued a notice stating: "This chief patrol officer is ordered by the constitution to supervise the patrol and Baojia affairs inside and outside the city. It has been reported that there are notorious ruffians, as well as swindlers, matchmakers, kidnappers, pickpockets, thieves, and foreign gangsters, gathering in groups of three or five in tea houses and wine shops, calling it 'eating Jiang tea'; colluding to defraud and acting lawlessly, harming the local area, and falsely claiming collisions, extorting money, snatching hats, stealing objects, seizing women's jewelry, fabricating rumors... Especially, there are unscrupulous people who gather crowds to open gambling dens, collecting commissions and profiting from them, such as Pai Gow, dice throwing, Ya Bao, Fantianyin, and various other names... In order to eliminate harm for the people, this chief patrol officer should arrest and severely punish them by name. However, considering their ignorance, I cannot bear to punish them without teaching them. If they can refrain from now on... then they will be spared from the past; if they continue on the same path... they will be immediately named and investigated." From this, it can be seen that the management matters of the bureau were only like this.</p>
<h3>Road Works Aftermath Bureau and Recruitment Regulations</h3>
<p>During the Patrol and Baojia Bureau period, the military and police were still mixed and undivided. In the twenty-fourth year of Guangxu, the Road Works Bureau in the southern city was renamed the Road Works Aftermath Bureau. As the outer roads had recently been built, the "Chinese Patrol Police Station" was established for the purpose of suppressing patrols and investigations. Three locations were set up in the P灘 area, and patrol officers were selected from the Yongding battalion of the Jiangsu Fubiao army stationed there. Recruitment regulations were also established: "1. Must be physically strong; 2. Around 30 years old; 3. Regardless of which province they are from, they must be familiar with the local situation and be able to speak the local language; 4. Must have a proper shop guarantee; 5. Must not smoke opium, be addicted to alcohol, or gamble; 6. Must take the examination at the bureau in person and not be allowed to be replaced; 7. One person is not allowed to register under two names, violators will be penalized; 8. Those who are absent will be deducted from the register and will not be allowed to retake the exam; 9. The bureau's servants who have been dismissed for reasons are not allowed to serve as patrol officers; 10. Separate regulations for patrol and Yongding officers will be established and strictly followed, violators will be punished." Later, 60 patrol officers were selected, and the Shanghai Daotai subsequently hired six Indian patrol officers. When Wusong planned to open a port, it was proposed to set up a patrol police station, but it was not realized. In the 30th year of Guangxu, the Zhabei Engineering Bureau requested official operation due to insufficient commercial funds, which was realized in the 32nd year of Guangxu.</p>
<h3>From Police Academy to Patrol Police Bureau</h3>
<p>The establishment of the bureau and the recruitment of patrol officers was merely imitating the concession regulations and did not establish a police administrative system. In the thirtieth year of Guangxu, the Qing government added the Patrol Police Department. The Shanghai Daotai drafted a plan and submitted it to the Jiangdu and Sufu for approval to set up the police. The Shanghai Magistrate was appointed as the director, and one officer stationed in the camp was appointed as the co-director to assist him with five local gentry. The training of talents was started first. The Qiuzhi Academy was changed into the Police Academy. A student majoring in police administration who had studied in Japan was hired as a teacher. One hundred Yongding soldiers stationed in the camp were selected to study in the academy, and students were also recruited at the same time. Starting from the thirty-first year of Guangxu, the Police Station was opened and the Patrol and Baojia Bureau was abolished, renamed the Patrol Police Bureau. Due to limited funds, the scale was very small, and the regulations were also very simple. In the thirty-third year of Guangxu, the Jiangdu sent a telegram to the Shanghai Daotai, stating that "the security of Shanghai is related to the overall situation, and we must devote all our efforts to protect our sovereignty." The police administration was promoted, and a candidate Daotai was appointed as the director. The Zhabei Engineering Bureau, which had been changed to the officially run Shanghai North City Road Engineering Patrol Bureau, was reorganized again into the Shanghai Patrol Police Bureau, planning the police area into four districts and twenty sub-districts. The following year, the Qing government changed the Ministry of Civil Affairs and sent a telegram to Jiangsu Province to set up a Patrol Police Daotai. Shanghai set up a Patrol Police Daotai to implement policing in the four districts and twenty-two sub-districts. Later, the Patrol Police Daotai was transferred to Suzhou, and the Shanghai Patrol Police Bureau was changed to a bureau director.</p>
<h3>New Look After the Republic</h3>
<p>After Shanghai was restored, the director of the Zhabei Patrol Police Bureau fled without a trace. The city's police affairs were under the jurisdiction of the Director of the Police Department of the Shanghai Municipal Government. In the second year of the Republic of China, the Yuan government promulgated the "Uniformity Order of the Current Local Police Office Organization," and the Songhu Police Department was established, with jurisdiction over the two counties of Shanghai and Baoshan. The internal departments included the Secretarial and Inspection Offices, and the General Affairs, Administration, Justice, and Health Sections; the external departments included one to six district offices, and 19 sub-offices under the districts. There was also a security police team, four patrol police teams, a water patrol police team, and a detective police team, totaling more than 3,000 people. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Special City was formally established, and the Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau was established to be in charge of Shanghai's police administration. In the 19th year, it was renamed the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. In the 26th year, it was renamed the Shanghai Police Bureau. However, the scope of jurisdiction was limited to the suburbs. After the victory, the two concessions were taken back, and the authority was also taken back at the same time. Shanghai's police administration was thus unified.</p>
<h3>The "Patrol Police Station" of the Past</h3>
<p>"Go to the Hangli" has become a common saying in Shanghai. The so-called "Hang" is the patrol police station that used to maintain security in the concessions. Police is a modern professional term, but the two concessions still used the old term "Patrol Police," and the agency was also called the Patrol Police Station.</p>
<p>Sounding the Alarm</p>
<p>When the concessions were first established, only a few Chinese were hired as watchmen to sound alarms. This was under the jurisdiction of the consul. In 1854, the Small Swords Society occupied Shanghai County, and residents flocked to the concessions. The three countries of Britain, the United States, and France jointly established a Municipal Council. At the same time, citing the practical need, they organized a patrol police team and hired Clifford, an official from the Hong Kong Patrol Police Station, to serve as the chief patrol officer in Shanghai. This was the beginning of the establishment of the Patrol Police Station in the concessions.</p>
<p>According to the land regulations first established, the Chinese government expressly stipulated that a police office was not allowed to be set up in the concessions. When the Taiping Army invaded, Shanghai County still had to beg for British and French protection, so it was natural that the concessions could not be taken care of. The consuls of Britain, the United States, and France arbitrarily amended the land regulations and established a police office.</p>
<p>The Patrol Police Station belonged to the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council. If there was any infringement of the consul's authority, the consuls would be dissatisfied. In 1855, the Small Swords Society withdrew from Shanghai County, and order gradually recovered. The consuls thought that it was dangerous for the Municipal Council to place weapons in the hands of the Patrol Police. After consultation among the consuls of Britain, the United States, and France, the result was that they jointly issued a notice stating that the current Patrol Police officials had been suspended from their duties and that they could not perform their duties without the approval of the Chinese and foreign authorities. Four months later, British Consul Aliguer signed an agreement with the Municipal Council, and since then the Public Concession had a standing patrol police force.</p>
<p>Initially, There Were Only Eight Police Officers</p>
<p>Initially, there were only eight police officers in the concession, led by the chief patrol officer. In 1860, the Taiping Army attacked Shanghai, and the number of Chinese entering the concession suddenly increased to 300,000. The number of police officers in the concession also suddenly increased to 200. In 1864, the Taiping Army was defeated, and most of the Chinese refugees returned, and the Chinese population in the concession fell to about 70,000. It was quite difficult in terms of administration economy, so the police force was reduced to 164.</p>
<p>Initially, the police officers in the concession were all foreigners. The hiring of Chinese police officers began in 1865. In this year, the Public Concession had 61 foreign police officers and 42 Chinese police officers. In 1884, Indian police officers began to be hired. In 1926, 30 Japanese police officers were also hired and stationed in the Hongkou area. The area of the concession expanded day by day, and the population became denser day by day. The number of police officers increased accordingly, and the strength of the guard also increased. By 1937, the police office of the Public Concession had 452 foreign police officers, 272 Japanese police officers, 3,452 Chinese police officers, and 555 Indian police officers.</p>
<p>Former French Concession</p>
<p>As for the French Concession, Consul General Eitang was the first to oppose the patrol police system and stated that he did not want to be involved in the Municipal Council of the Public Concession retaining patrol police. However, since the failure of the Small Swords Society, the market situation in the French Concession had also gradually prospered. In 1856, at a meeting of landlords, there was a proposal to organize a patrol police station in the French Concession, and three foreign patrol police officers were hired to patrol day and night. However, this was cancelled at the beginning of the following year due to landlord opposition. It was not until December of that year that 12 patrol police officers were hired, and the patrol police station was formally established.</p>
<p>In 1862, the French Concession separated from the Public Concession and became independent, and the Public Board of Directors was established. The directors were appointed by the French Consul. From that time on, the patrol police station was also placed under the jurisdiction of the Public Board of Directors. After taking over, the Public Board of Directors actively reorganized the small patrol police station and appointed Nengde, a retired French soldier stationed in Shanghai, as the chief patrol officer. At this time, the number of arrest warrants had increased to 4, and there were 20 patrol officers. By 1906, Vietnamese arrests were added, and the number of Chinese arrests was also increased to more than 150. By 1935, there were more than 2,000 police officers in the French Concession.</p>
<p>The administrative head of the police office was the police chief supervisor, who was directly ordered by the French Consul General stationed in Shanghai. However, the expenses of the police office and the salaries of the police officers were borne by the Public Board of Directors of the French Concession. This was different from the system of the Public Concession.</p>
<p>After the victory, the patrol police stations were also dissolved along with the concessions. Most of the foreign police officers who had served in the two concessions had been dismissed, and Shanghai's police power was thus unified.</p>
<h3>The "All-Knowing" of the Concessions Era</h3>
<p>In the past, the police departments of the two concessions in this city had plainclothes detectives, commonly known as "Bao Da Ting" [All-Knowing]. These individuals were familiar with the situation of Shanghai society, divided into categories, each with a defined scope, generally classified as "political," "gambling and opium," "bandits and thieves," and "prostitution tax."</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the "Bao Da Ting" of the French Concession had a special temporary task: protecting important Chinese government figures passing through or residing there. When necessary, they even took up permanent residence in the homes of these important figures, taking shifts around the clock until the figures left Shanghai, at which point they would withdraw.</p>
<p>These "All-Knowing" carried pistols on their person for immediate execution of their duties. However, because they were in plainclothes, they could often achieve "lightning-fast" results. There were amusing stories of robbers and petty thieves attempting robbery and extortion against the "Bao Da Ting," only to be captured on the spot and turned into prisoners delivered to the door.</p>
<p>The current municipal police bureau still employs plainclothes officers, but the name "Bao Da Ting" is rarely heard anymore. Especially for those newly arrived in Shanghai from other places, if you mention that name to them, they will surely be at a loss as to what you mean.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Female Police Officers</h3>
<p>In the city, there are many who commit crimes, and they spare no effort to evade the eyes and ears of law enforcement. They even exploit ignorant women to carry contraband, engaging in various cooperative criminal activities involving both men and women. Because male police officers are restricted by gender differences, they are often unable to directly exercise their authority even when encountering suspicious individuals. Thus, female police officers emerged as needed.</p>
<p>New York was the birthplace of female police officers. In our country, Hangzhou was the first city to establish a female police force, followed by Peiping. Their performance in service has been very good.</p>
<p>In the spring of the eighteenth year of the Republic [1929], the Shanghai Sixth District Party Headquarters proposed to the municipal government the establishment of female inspectors. Mayor Zhang Yuejun ordered the Public Security Bureau Chief Yuan Liang to conduct recruitment examinations. The qualifications for application at that time required excellent character and scholarship, age over thirty, and familiarity with social conditions. Although there was enthusiastic registration, only twenty were selected after the examination. After reviewing their resumes, they were all highly educated, and most had served as school principals, teachers, and civil servants. After being selected, experts were hired to train them, and then they were assigned to stations and docks for service. They performed well, and over the years, they cracked countless cases of kidnapping women, bandit gangs, gambling dens, drugs, and weapons. However, these female inspectors mostly worked in plainclothes, unlike female police officers.</p>
<p>The formal addition of female police officers in Shanghai began in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic [1936]. First, Public Security Bureau Chief Cai Jingjun, seeing the need for female police officers in the city, specifically requested the municipal government's approval to establish a female police training class within the police training center. Forty female police officers were recruited, with 274 applicants. 228 people actually took the test. Most of the applicants were junior high school graduates, totaling 154; 74 were elementary school graduates, 12 were high school graduates, and 7 had college degrees or higher. On August 12, the results were announced, with 25 officially selected and 5 as alternates. The remaining 15 vacancies were filled by a second round of recruitment on August 24. After the two rounds of examinations, a total of 36 fully qualified candidates were selected. The opening ceremony was held on September 1 at the Longhua Police Training Center. The female police uniforms were uniformly black tops, white pants, and black hats, solemn and neat. After four months of training, all graduated on New Year's Day of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic [1937]. On January 7, they were formally assigned to various branch bureaus to assist in household registration investigations and serve as female investigators, and they were diligent and competent in their work.</p>
<h3>Bamboo Cloth Long Gown and Melon-Cap Hat: Such Strange Attire for Chinese Police</h3>
<p>When Chinese police officers were first employed by the French Concession, their attire was very unique: in the autumn and summer seasons, they wore melon-cap hats with a large red knot sewn on top, and long gowns made of bamboo cloth. There were no regulations for the style of shoes. In the winter, they wore felt hats with gold tassels and gray cotton robes, covered with Western-style overcoats. Badges and numbers identified them, and they carried a "swagger stick" as a means of self-defense.</p>
<p>Soon after, the uniform was changed to a sky-blue feather satin jacket, similar in shape to a mandarin jacket but slightly longer, with a badge and number worn on the left lapel to show uniformity. However, the pants and shoes could still be worn at will. Except in summer, when they wore red-tasseled rattan hats, they usually wore large red-tasseled hats. Later, the red tassels on the hats were changed to red, white, and blue. Eventually, the dark-colored pants were abolished and replaced with uniform pants identical to the jackets, which began to resemble police uniforms somewhat.</p>
<h3>A Brief Account of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>This special organization for defending Shanghai has a history almost as long as the concessions themselves. Throughout its long history, it has undergone many reforms, and its ranks are quite modernized. In the past, Shanghai repeatedly suffered from war, and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps certainly fulfilled a great responsibility.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Volunteer Corps began with the "Volunteer Force" organized by British residents in 1853. At that time, the Taiping Army had taken Nanjing and Zhenjiang, and foreign residents in Shanghai were fearful. They armed themselves to remain neutral, and organizing the Volunteer Force was the first thing they did. In 1855, the Taiping Army's momentum waned, and the Volunteer Force gradually became nominal. In 1860, the Taiping Army again captured Hangzhou and approached Suzhou, so the Shanghai British Volunteer Force was reorganized to protect the concessions.</p>
<p>In 1862, a light cavalry unit was also organized, and the existence of the Volunteer Corps gradually became permanent. On July 2, 1870, the Volunteer Corps held a meeting and decided to be governed by the Municipal Council, becoming a formal organization. Since then, it has been expanded and reorganized many times, and affiliated units have continued to increase. Some affiliated units were disbanded midway, such as the Customs Team, but most were maintained until the disbandment in 1942. The establishment dates of each unit are listed below:</p>
<p>"A" Company British 1853</p>

<h3>Chinese Company</h3>
<p>The Chinese Company in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was reorganized from the Chinese Merchants Gymnastics Association. After Shanghai became an international city with the opening of trade, Chinese people were often discriminated against by foreigners. In 1905, the case of Li Huang led to a major disturbance at the Mixed Court, causing unrest that lasted for days. Thereupon, Chu Qiaqing, Hu Jimei, Yuan Hengzhi, and others initiated the organization of the Volunteer Corps to maintain local security and protect the lives and property of residents. They raised funds and initially established it within the Chinese Merchants Gymnastics Association, later changing it to the Chinese Company Public Association. At one time, more than 500 people responded to the call, divided into four infantry companies, one cavalry company, and one military band. They opened up vacant land on North Zhejiang Road as a parade ground, purchased firearms, and hired instructors, and they became a proper army.</p>
<p>One year after the Chinese Company was established, it never had any relations with the concessions, and the number of members gradually decreased. The initiators decided to request to join the Shanghai Volunteer Corps as the Chinese Company. With the consent of the Municipal Council, they signed a contract to join the Corps on March 17, 1907, at the Municipal Hall on Nanjing Road at the time, becoming one of the affiliated units of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.</p>
<h3>Five Conditions</h3>
<p>When the Chinese Company first joined, the Municipal Council stipulated five conditions: (1) The number of people should be between 50 and 100. (2) Members must be respectable merchants, unrelated to politics, and in good health. (3) Each person must have a substantial guarantor. (4) The company commander must be a Westerner. (5) Firearms and bayonets must not be taken home; they must be collected before use and returned to the armory after use. At that time, the members compromised and maintained a pure union, which was warmly admired by both Chinese and foreigners. In particular, when they participated in the shooting competition for the first time in 1909, they won the "Brainsby" trophy, which was greatly praised. They gradually received equal treatment with the other national teams, which made the later prosperous situation.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the organization of the Volunteer Corps has been expanding daily. Initially, the Municipal Council signed a contract with the British War Office to borrow regular army officers to serve as commanders, but after the outbreak of the European War, volunteer officers took over. The training of the Volunteer Corps included marching, shooting, marching drills, mobilization exercises, riot control, and field warfare and camping, etc. The target range in Hongkou Park is where the Volunteer Corps practiced shooting. The target range was originally located near North Henan Road on Target Road, but because the nearby residents gradually increased, it was moved next to Hongkou Park in 1895.</p>
<p>In September 1942, the former Municipal Council resolved to disband the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The 90-year-old Shanghai Volunteer Corps thus became a name in Shanghai's history.</p>
<h3>Mounted Patrol</h3>
<p>In the past, during the concession era, whenever there were large parades or troops departing, there were always several Indian police officers riding tall horses leading the way. Even for the grand funerals of wealthy families, they were used to clear the road. This was the Mounted Patrol of the concessions, a very special decoration of Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Mounted Patrol originated in 1864 and was officially established the following year, initially starting in Yangshupu. At that time, Macleod Road was still a wilderness with no inhabitants and no patrol police. There was a so-called "Light No. 96," which was the only police light in the area, allowing citizens coming from afar to safely return to the city at night. The authorities lit this light to protect the safety of the area. Every time the sun set, the Mounted Patrol would send two people to guard it, and they would return only after the light was extinguished the next morning. At the time, this work was considered adventurous, so the Mounted Patrol was established to handle it.</p>
<p>Later, the Mounted Patrol gradually expanded to the entire Public Concession. The section from the Racecourse to Jing'an Temple was the patrol area of the Mounted Patrol, performing a rather interesting task: prohibiting galloping on the road and carriages from speeding, because Shanghai people at the time liked to race in carriages, so-called "showing off." Later, as the population increased in the Hongqiao area, the duties of the Mounted Patrol expanded to Macleod Road. The Mounted Patrol played a special role in Shanghai's police administration. The areas where roads were built beyond the boundaries were all patrolled by them, serving as a security guarantee. However, since the popularity of automobiles, the Mounted Patrol has lost its value, and it was disbanded in September 1940 due to feed difficulties.</p>
<p>The personnel of the Mounted Patrol never exceeded thirty people. At the time of dissolution, there were two foreign and two Indian police officers, and 22 Indian police officers, most of whom had served in the Indian Army. The organization was quite similar to the Royal Canadian Northwest Mounted Police, aiming to achieve greater results with fewer personnel. This 26-person Mounted Patrol was sufficient for the entire Public Concession at the time. The team had forty fine horses, most of which were donated by horse owners in the city, and many were famous steeds that had triumphed at the racecourse. When the Mounted Patrol was disbanded, they were returned to their original owners.</p>
<h3>The Former Indian Police, Annamese Police, and Japanese Police</h3>
<p>In the past, Shanghai's police, in addition to Chinese officers and Western police of the concessions, also included Indian police, Annamese police, and Japanese police. These many people of different ethnicities jointly defended this international city.</p>
<p>Indian police can be said to be a special decoration of Shanghai. Each one was a burly man, with a full beard and a red turban, which contrasted interestingly with their dark brown skin. The Indian police in the Mounted Patrol, riding on tall horses, felt even more imposing. No wonder some people would use Indian police to scare crying children late at night. "Ah San" became a synonym for Indian police, but its origin is unknown.</p>
<p>Indian Police</p>
<p>When did Shanghai have Indian police? In 1860, when the Taiping Army attacked Shanghai County, it was said that they were once repelled by Indian soldiers, which shows that Indian soldiers had already arrived in Shanghai at that time. However, the Public Concession formally employed Indian police 24 years later. According to the Municipal Council's population survey, in 1880, there were only 4 Indians, but by 1885, the number had increased sharply to 58. This is related to the Indian police issue.</p>
<p>In 1883, the Municipal Council's record of rectifying the constables included a plan to employ 65 Indian police officers, followed by new regulations for recruiting Indian police officers. The existence of Indian police in the concessions began at that time. In 1884, the Municipal Council's accounting report showed that expenditure on constables increased by more than 10,000 taels, which can also be determined to be due to the employment of Indian police officers. That year, the Sino-French War broke out, and the Municipal Council believed that it was necessary to set up police to protect foreigners outside the boundaries. Therefore, in addition to the existing Chinese police officers managing traffic, Indian police officers were added to Jing'an Temple Road and neighboring roads. This can be seen in the Municipal Council's annual report, which is the earliest official record mentioning Indian police officers. If we count until the outbreak of the Pacific War, Indian police officers were in Shanghai for more than 50 years.</p>
<p>Annamese Police</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department began employing Annamese people as constables in 1900. At that time, the Boxer Rebellion was rampant, and foreigners in the Tianjin area were killed one after another. The people of Shanghai were panicked, especially the foreigners. Therefore, they successively mobilized warships and berthed in the Huangpu River, claiming to protect the concessions.</p>
<p>The French Concession established a Defense Committee to prepare for emergency measures. At the same time, the board of directors of the Public Police Bureau felt that it was inappropriate to employ many Chinese police officers in the concessions under the anti-foreign trend. In order to implement the policy of "controlling the Yellow with the Yellow," it was decided to employ Annamese police officers. At that time, French Consul Bazzet de Maisonneuve asked Vietnamese Governor-General Doumer to send Tokyo residents to Shanghai. In mid-July, 29 Annamese police officers sent by the Vietnamese Governor arrived in Shanghai. This was the beginning of the appearance of Annamese police officers in Shanghai.</p>
<p>By March 1901, the war had ended, and a peace treaty had been signed. These 29 Annamese police officers of wartime nature were also sent back to Annam by the Public Council. In 1906, the board of directors of the French Public Works Bureau decided to recruit Annamese police officers again. This is what we saw in the French Concession before the war. Shanghai officially employed Annamese police officers from that time.</p>
<p>Japanese Police</p>
<p>The nature of the Japanese police was different from that of the employed Indian police and Annamese police. They were established at the request of the Japanese residents in Shanghai, specifically to protect their safety.</p>
<p>In 1914, the Municipal Council already had three Japanese police officers engaged in translation and handling disputes between Chinese and Japanese people. In 1916, Japanese Consul Ariyoshi Akira and Municipal Council Japanese Director Fujimura Yoshirou suggested to the Municipal Council that Japanese police officers be added, and it was adopted and implemented. The Police Department then hired three police officers and 27 constables from Tokyo to Shanghai. In November of that year, the Japanese Police Patrol Team was established and assigned to the North Sichuan Road area to begin service.</p>
<p>The number of Japanese police officers gradually expanded as the number of Japanese residents increased. By 1926, the number of Japanese police officers had increased to 96, and in 1927, it increased to 256. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the power of the Japanese police became even greater. In the Hongkou area, they used their special power to create many tragedies.</p>

<h3>Ample Supply of Domestic Goods: Import of Woolens Should Be Restricted Foreign Goods Are Dumped, and Production Cannot Develop: Actual Sales This Year Are Only 1.5 Million Yards</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Woolen Textile Dyeing Industry Association believes that domestic woolens are on the verge of collapse due to the recent frenzied dumping of foreign goods. At the beginning of the promulgation of the Interim Measures for the Revision of Import and Export Trade, it specifically reported the current production and sales situation of the industry and the fact that domestic woolens are sufficient to supply the needs of the whole country. It requested the Executive Committee of the Temporary Import and Export Control Committee to strictly restrict the import of woolen products in order to save the industry and cultivate the foundation of the country. Excerpts from the report are as follows:</p>
<p>Current Production Capacity</p>
<p>(1) A total of 59 member factories of various sizes belong to this association. According to the survey in February of this year, the equipment included: 18,000 spindles for coarse spinning and about 9,700 spindles for fine spinning, and 1,050 looms (excluding those added after February). By October of this year, this association conducted a detailed survey of the production quantity of each member due to the new sales tax. The statistics are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Production volume during the peak season of August, September, and October:</p>
<p>1. About 500 looms were operating during the daytime (less than half of the total).</p>
<p>2. About 200 looms were operating day and night (less than one-fifth of the total).</p>
<p>Each loom can weave 11 yards per shift regardless of thickness, for a monthly production (26 days) of about 250,000 yards. The total production volume for August, September, and October was 750,000 yards.</p>
<p>(B) From January to July (off-season), due to the lack of restoration and the unavailability of raw materials, less than one-tenth or one-twentieth of the factories were operating. Therefore, the total production volume for the seven months was 200,000 yards.</p>
<p>(C) The actual sales volume of each factory only reached 60% of the production volume (due to the frenzied dumping of foreign goods everywhere and the weak purchasing power).</p>
<p>Figures for Dumping of Foreign Goods</p>
<p>According to the above statistics, the total sales volume of domestic woolens this year is below 500,000 yards, less than 20% of the total production volume. On the other hand, the volume of foreign woolens that arrived in the past 10 months was over 1 million yards (according to customs and woolen industry survey reports). The quantity ordered and about to arrive is also about 1 million yards. Among them, the majority are Melton woolens for coarse spinning and women's woolens. Based on the above facts, the sales of domestic woolens are less than half of those of foreign goods.</p>
<p>Excellent Quality of Domestic Goods</p>
<p>(2) In terms of the quality of woolens and yarns, the members of this association have accumulated more than 20 years of experience and firmly believe that there is further progress in technology every year. If the original materials are the same, the products can be comparable to foreign goods. Test the attached samples of various domestic and imported goods. The quality of domestic products has surpassed that of imported products. All kinds of machinery and equipment are available. Only since the victory, foreign goods have been frantically dumped. And import merchants, ignorant of the situation, each acts on its own. Many consider the import of woolens as a source of huge profits. Blind and frenzied imports have led to oversupply and losses for both parties. (Among them, private goods from a large number of Jewish merchants are the worst.)</p>
<p>Domestic Production Is Already Excessive</p>
<p>(3) In terms of production and actual sales:</p>
<p>(A) Minimum production volume of the spinning industry:</p>
<p>1. Woolens: Based on the 1,050 looms surveyed in January of this year (not counting those added later), each loom can produce 11 yards per shift, so operating day and night can produce far 600,000 yards per month. Shanghai alone can produce at least 7 million yards per year. And the output of the state-owned China Textile factories can offset all private factories. Adding the factories in North China and Southwest China, the total national output is often around 20 million yards.</p>
<p>2. Wool yarn: Each wool yarn factory in this association can produce 300,000 pounds per month. And the two foreign-owned factories, Bee and Jardine Matheson, can also produce 300,000 pounds per month. Shanghai alone can produce about 7 million pounds.</p>
<p>(B) Actual sales volume of woolens and yarns this year:</p>
<p>The actual sales of woolens and yarns are limited to cities and have not been popularized in rural areas. In recent years, people's livelihoods have been declining, purchasing power is weak, and sewing costs are extremely high, making sales even more difficult. According to the above statistics, domestic woolens only sold 500,000 yards this year, and foreign goods sold more than 1 million yards. The total actual sales were only about 1.5 million yards, less than one-tenth of the total production volume, which is already considered oversupply. Therefore, in the past month, when woolens and yarns were in season and selling well, prices fell by 30%. The unsold inventory of each factory has reached 40%. It is fundamentally unnecessary to import foreign woolens and yarns, and it is only destroying the foundation of the domestic industry.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Decline in Production</p>
<p>(4) Furthermore, the reason why domestic goods cannot compete with foreign goods in recent years is entirely because costs cannot be reduced. And the biggest reason why costs cannot be reduced is that production cannot be fully utilized. For example, if a factory has 50 looms, it is currently only running 10 looms during the day, and can only produce 110 yards per day. If all 50 looms were running during the day, they could produce 1,100 yards per day. The production volume is a ratio of 1 to 10. It is a waste of human and financial resources to use the equipment for producing 10 yards to make one yard of woolens, resulting in an opportunity for foreign goods to be dumped, causing domestic factories to sink deeper into the mire and unable to extricate themselves. Thinking of this, I am really worried about the future of the industry. However, learn from the past, and the future can be pursued. Hereafter, I earnestly request that the association weigh the pros and cons and quickly prohibit the import of foreign woolens and yarns listed in the attached table (3) 119, 122. Then our domestic woolens will have lower costs due to higher production volume and lower selling prices, and factories will compete with each other, which will not only make significant progress in technology, but also allow business to develop mutually, thereby laying a solid foundation for the industry. At that time, even if there is competition from imported goods, we can be prepared for any eventuality. Moreover, domestic woolens can not only be sold throughout the country to recover our rights, but also be promoted to Southeast Asia and other places to earn foreign exchange for the country, and the day of glorifying and expanding is just around the corner.</p>
<h3>Stores Closed: All Will Open Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday. The banking industry and major businesses were closed as usual. Due to the unresolved hawker unrest, several stores were forced to close. For safety reasons, many stores closed their doors voluntarily. The scene on the streets was almost the same as during the New Year. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has issued a notice advising them to resume business. All will open today.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Are Difficult to Stabilize: Transportation Is Restricted: Sales Are Not Free</h3>
<p>The price of coal in this city has risen sharply due to the increased demand as the weather has turned cold. The current price of bituminous coal has risen to the 400,000 mark per ton. Coal balls for cooking for citizens have also risen to 12,000 to 13,000 yuan per load, and there are frequent shortages, which poses a great threat to people's livelihoods. According to the Fuel Management Committee, the biggest difficulty at present is the transportation problem. If the quantity of coal shipped to Shanghai from various coal-producing areas is not restricted by transportation, it will be sufficient to meet the city's needs. Taiwan can also ship out a large quantity. Therefore, the source of coal is not a problem in itself. It is now in contact with allocating special ships to transport coal to the coal-producing areas, so that the reserves in this city will become more and more abundant, and the black market prices can be eliminated. The production and sales of bituminous coal in this city are strictly controlled by the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee, and merchants are not allowed to freely mine and transport coal. Because the committee also restricts the allocation of goods, the market price has skyrocketed.</p>
<h3>Fujian Paper Mill Revives</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 30th] The provincial government has approved the registration of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Company. The company has recently decided to invest in the establishment of the Fuzhou Tap Water Company and the revival of the Fujian Paper Mill. According to the company, the scale of the mill is huge. Before the war, it produced 6 tons of bamboo pulp and 5 tons of paper per day, with a maximum paper production of more than 10 tons. It was bombed and stopped work in 1938, suffering heavy losses.</p>
<h3>List of Edible Oil Joint Allocation Conference: Distribution and Sale in Seven Zones Citywide: If the Market Price Is Lower Than the Negotiated Price, Sell at the Market Price</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office held an important meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. The attendees included Zhang Chao, Chen Zhonghe, Qin Linsheng, Zhang Kejia, and others, 10 people in total. Zhang Chao chaired the meeting. The following important matters were decided: (1) The burden of routine expenses shall, in principle, be subsidized by manufacturers in the industry. If there is a shortfall, please ask various industries to subsidize. (2) The distribution of edible oil will be carried out in seven zones citywide. The seven zones are the Pudong Zone, Zhabei Zone, Hudong Zone, the Old Eight Districts Zone, H unan Zone, Huxi Zone, and the Central Zone. The number of groups in the seven zones will vary depending on the population and will not be uniformly regulated. Each group will have one director, responsible for the supply of edible oil to 30 households. First, conduct a detailed survey of the actual needs of users, and then supply them as much as possible. As for the selling price, the meeting decided that if the market price is lower than the negotiated price, it will be sold at the market price; conversely, if the market price is higher than the negotiated price, it will be sold at the negotiated price. If the quantity of edible oil is insufficient in the future, Mayor Wu has already instructed in the past that the China Edible Oil Company can provide subsidies. Today, the persons in charge of the Joint Allocation Office will visit Mayor Wu to report.</p>
<h3>U.S. Dumping Stored Bristles Affects Sichuan Bristle Exports</h3>
<p>The quality of Sichuan bristles surpasses that of other regions in the country, and foreign factories are very willing to use them. In the past, the U.S. government proposed dumping 100,000 pounds of stored bristles, which also affected the Sichuan bristle market, and the price dropped to $2.70 per pound. Recently, due to supply and demand, the pig bristle market has become active again, and the market price has risen to $2.95 per pound. More than 1,600 dan (a unit of weight) were shipped out last month. Transactions this month are larger, estimated at about 2,100 zu (another unit of weight), and more than 1,800 dan have already been shipped. There are still 300 dan to be loaded at the end of the month. Yesterday, export businesses received a telegram from New York stating that the U.S. government will sell its inventory again. If this is true, our pig bristles will undoubtedly be hit. According to Sichuan pig bristle industry insiders, if the U.S. market price drops, they will not be greedy to do business because the current cost in Sichuan has already increased, and there is almost no profit to be made at the price of $2.95. It is said that the China Trust Bureau plans to order 2,000 dan of Sichuan bristles to repay debts. Yesterday, it signed a contract with the Animal Husbandry and Heyuan companies for 1,100 dan. The remaining 900 dan will be handled with Baoti and Chongde companies.</p>
<h3>Small Hardware Business Stagnant</h3>
<p>The members of the Small Hardware Parts Industry Association in this city are currently experiencing sluggish business, reaching the most depressed situation. It is understood that the main reason is the high cost of hardware materials, and many members are exploited by usurious loans, and sales are sluggish. Currently, business has plummeted.</p>
<h3>35,000 Tons of New Medicines Among U.S. Military Surplus, Atabrine Can Supply the Entire Country for Five Years</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At a time when the nation's industry and commerce are precarious, the development of the new drug industry is also considerably affected. Yesterday, this reporter specially visited Mr. Shi Zhifu, the chairman of the New Drug Business Association in this city. He said that although the new drug business has declined compared to six months ago, there is generally no serious phenomenon. Generally speaking, goods imported before June of this year are still profitable. Goods arriving after June have suffered interest losses due to the long-term strike of American sailors. At the same time, there are no statistics on the import of new drugs, and people outside the industry are placing orders, and postal packages of medicines sent directly from abroad also have a considerable impact on the business of the industry, and many are losing money. Mr. Shi also stated that the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan purchased various medicines totaling 35,000 tons from U.S. military surplus materials on 16 islands in the Pacific Ocean, totaling more than 1,900 types. It is said that Atabrine for treating malaria is stored in Qingdao, and the quantity is sufficient to supply the entire China for five years. Some say that the medicines purchased by Lida Trading Company are merely the garbage from outside the islands, to describe the abundance of materials. These medicines will be shipped in batches in a few months, and then various parties will consult with the New Drug Business Association to discuss distribution. A new agency will be established for the allocation of these materials. The price of medicines on the market may be stable. At the same time, in order to take into account the business of the pharmaceutical industry, the new drug industry will absolutely cooperate closely with the pharmaceutical factories, and pharmaceutical raw materials will be supplied to the pharmaceutical factories as much as possible, and all kinds of conveniences will be provided. If domestic transportation is smooth, the medicines produced by domestic pharmaceutical factories and the existing goods in pharmacies can be sold in large quantities to various places, and the future of the pharmaceutical industry is quite optimistic. However, according to Mr. Shi, most of these surplus medicines are for surgical use, and pharmacies generally need only one-tenth or two-tenths of them.</p>
<h3>Cargo Transportation Decreases, Tonnage Oversupply</h3>
<p>According to sources in the shipping industry, before the war, our country had more than 500,000 tons of shipping vessels nationwide, plus 400,000 tons from companies such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson. However, at that time, our country often leased 100,000 tons of shipping vessels to other small foreign companies, so in fact, only about 400,000 tons were used by Chinese businesses. Because foreign shipping vessels joined in operation at that time, 400,000 tons were sufficient for transportation. Currently, there are 600,000 tons of shipping vessels nationwide, of which about 200,000 tons were recently purchased from the United States. However, in the past two months, affected by the economic downturn, cargo transportation has gradually declined, and companies with smaller scope feel it is difficult to maintain. If we observe the current situation, even 500,000 tons of shipping vessels can maintain transportation.</p>
<h3>Four Cooperative Factories, Two Are Unusable, Funding is a Problem</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the organization of silk cooperative factories, after detailed discussions among the National Cooperative Supply and Marketing Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the China Silk Corporation, and the Bureau of Social Affairs, the biggest difficulty found was the raising of funds. Of the four factories promised by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, two cannot be used due to internal materials and other reasons, so only two factories can actually be operated. The planned capital for operating two cooperative factories is 800 million yuan, but Zhong and the Ministry of Social Affairs can only contribute 50 million yuan together. The original share capital borne by workers was 100 million yuan, but currently only more than 100 workers can be accommodated, and whether they can subscribe to the planned shares is questionable. Moreover, the general silk industry is currently depressed, and the maintenance and development of cooperative factories in the future will also be a difficult task. However, despite the above difficulties, the three parties will actively prepare, starting with absorbing capital, to make the ideal of cooperative factories a reality.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Too High, Will Attract Large Quantities of Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>[East China News Agency] Recently, gold prices in this city have soared. Because a few people mistakenly believe that gold prices are relatively low, they have been buying frantically. However, according to financial sources, gold prices in this city are actually extremely high. The U.S. Treasury Department currently holds 576,503,353 ounces of gold, valued at $20,212,617,504. According to U.S. official estimates, each ounce is no more than $35, which is only worth 117,250 yuan in legal tender, which is more than one and a half times the current Shanghai gold market price. Therefore, based on international gold market prices, Shanghai gold prices are generally high, except for a few small countries in the Near East. If gold is shipped from the United States, Canada, or Mexico to Shanghai for sale, huge profits can be obtained. Therefore, international smugglers are rushing to smuggle gold to Shanghai in order to make huge profits.</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Industrial Recovery is Rapid</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Relevant sources told this reporter that the recovery of Taiwan's industry is very rapid. In terms of electricity, the power generation in December last year was 40,000 kilowatts, and in September it was about 120,000 kilowatts, and in November it may reach 160,000 kilowatts. Currently, the main task of the province's industry is not to create but to repair, because during the war, the province's industry suffered 50% losses. As for the speed of repair, it depends on the ability to quickly concentrate materials and manpower. In terms of manpower, a large number of technicians have recently gone to Taiwan to work. In terms of materials, most of the replenishment of industrial equipment is allocated from self-help relief materials and U.S. military surplus materials. Among the equipment received in the past, textile equipment accounted for the largest proportion. Currently, the surplus materials on Da Liuqiu Island are being classified and sorted, and some transportation equipment will be allocated in the future. Also, machine tools were obtained from relief materials in the past, which are indispensable materials for the revival of the province's industry.</p>
<h3>Easing Industrial and Commercial Loans, Methods Still Under Discussion</h3>
<p>According to sources in the financial industry, the government is inclined to ease industrial and commercial production loans to eliminate the evils of usury. If it can be eased, usury rates can be slightly reduced. It is said that the National Bank is carefully studying the methods for easing these production loans, and it is expected to be implemented in mid-month.</p>
<h3>Weekend U.S. Cotton Falls Back</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 30th] Cotton futures fell slightly compared to the previous day. Prices opened higher and lower in the morning, but selling pressure was very strong in the afternoon, and closed down 1 to 1.75 cents per pound. Also, a New Orleans telegram stated that cotton futures fell due to weekend selling, and prices trended downward, closing down 0.7 to 1.95 cents per pound.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cotton and Wool Textiles Ordered to Be Shipped to Korea</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 30th] MacArthur recently ordered the Japanese government to ship 300,000 pounds of wool textiles and 178,283 pounds of cotton and wool textiles to Korea to alleviate the shortage of warm clothing there.</p>
<h3>U.S. Treasury Revenue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] The Bureau of Economic Affairs estimated that the total U.S. Treasury revenue for the 1947 fiscal year will reach $175,000,000,000,000, compared to $165,000,000,000,000 this year.</p>
<h3>U.S. Tobacco Bumper Harvest</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] The estimated U.S. tobacco harvest for this year is 2,248,000,000 pounds, the largest harvest in history, an increase of 12% over last year.</p>

<h3>High Tax Rates Destroyed Commercial Ethics</h3>
<p>— Gan Yunshou</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and in the blink of an eye, we will welcome the New Year of the 36th year, and the industrial and commercial sectors will also follow the routine of replacing a new set of account books. We earnestly hope here that the new account books of this year must express the true and accurate situation, and must not repeat the mistakes of the past, always showing incorrect and unclear records. However, having said that, there are also unavoidable difficulties and reasons for the inaccurate results of past accounts. Standing on an objective position, we are really inconvenient to be too critical. Because the taxes are too heavy (business tax, stamp tax, interest income tax, profit tax, etc.) and the currency continues to inflate, these are ironclad facts. In order to maintain their original foundation, merchants try to secretly hide part of their assets or profit and loss accounts. This is also due to the actual needs and cannot be completely said to be wrong. Just think: if they are faithfully and fully expressed, wouldn't it reduce their original assets and affect their survival? To give an example: the 34th year's profit tax was levied according to the simplified collection regulations of the tax bureau, which was based on the net profit of various industries in the 34th year plus 50%. If the profit tax of the 35th year is levied next year, and the authorities repeat the old trick and add another 50% or 100% for levy, can they still afford it? Since past taxation has been unreasonable, then, of course, we must be vigilant about the future. For the present plan, if we want to ensure the accuracy of the industrial and commercial accounts for the coming year, we can only hope that the tax authorities must earnestly do the following points. First, there must be a clear and concrete expression for the method of levying the 35th year's profit tax, and absolutely no longer levy taxes according to the old method of the 34th year, so as not to cause suspicion and misunderstanding among merchants. Second, the various tax rates in the direct tax must be revised again and effectively reduced. Recently, some wholesale industries are said to have very little gross profit in each transaction after deducting stamp tax and business tax, or even no profit at all, or even losses. In addition, most of the net profit obtained must be dedicated to the government. Like last year's method, it is necessary to declare and pay 50% more based on the net profit. Therefore, when merchants talk about the issue of tax payment, everyone feels a headache and fear. Their minds naturally turn to how to evade taxes. Therefore, if the tax rate is not reduced, the false accounts of various industries will not be easily eliminated. Third, the treatment of tax officials must be reasonably adjusted to avoid improper behavior that helps to undermine tax laws. The ancients said: When clothing and food are sufficient, then one knows honor and disgrace. Recently, newspapers often expose the corrupt behavior of tax officials. This shows that on the one hand, the tax rate is too high, and merchants mostly want to evade taxes; on the other hand, the treatment is too low, and a small number of officials have to collude with merchants to do all kinds of illegal things. Therefore, raising treatment and reducing tax rates are the urgent tasks at hand. If the above points are adopted and implemented by the authorities, I believe that the industrial and commercial accounts of the coming year will definitely be more faithful and accurate. Merchants will never be willing to make false records deliberately, and of course there will be no more than two or three sets of account books. At the same time, the national tax revenue will definitely not be much worse than it is now.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Designates Four Universities to Establish Scholarships for Nanyang Students, Applications to Begin in the 36th Year</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Nanyang is closely connected with our country, and there are many overseas Chinese.

<h3>Mr. Li Ximou Discusses the Five-Year Education Plan: Establishing National Schools Throughout the City</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, in order to eliminate illiteracy and in line with national policy, has now formulated a five-year plan to revitalize education in the city. Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, who gave the following account:</p>
<p>Establishing an Educational Foundation: Establishing National Schools Everywhere</p>
<p>According to Mr. Li, the first task of this five-year plan is to establish national education, so as to lay the foundation for primary education. The current plan is to establish national schools throughout the city, with one central national school in each district and one "bao" (neighborhood) school in each "bao." The school buildings of central national schools in urban areas must have 20 to 30 classrooms, and in rural areas 10 to 20 classrooms. The school buildings of "bao" national schools in urban areas must have 6 to 20 classrooms, and in rural areas 10 classrooms. The exact numbers must be determined based on the population density in each area. As for the construction style, lighting, sports grounds, and sanitary facilities of the school buildings, engineering experts and education and sports experts must be consulted to make decisions.</p>
<p>Cultivating Technical Personnel: Emphasizing Normal Education</p>
<p>Once the foundation of national education has been laid, the next step is to promote secondary education. Four secondary education zones will be built in the four suburbs of the city. Public land will be allocated in each zone, or private land will be requisitioned, and all public and private middle schools in the urban area will be concentrated there. In rural areas where transportation is inconvenient, junior middle schools must be established everywhere to ensure balanced development. In addition, emphasis will be placed on promoting normal education, cultivating technical personnel, and establishing joint vocational schools for animal husbandry, sericulture, machinery, architecture, maritime affairs, pharmacy, and other fields.</p>
<p>Instilling Basic Knowledge: Focusing on Social Education</p>
<p>Once the above foundation has been laid, the focus will be on the development of social education, in order to instill basic knowledge and enable the people to have some understanding. This will include the following fifteen projects: (1) National Library, (2) Public Education Center, (3) Public Education Experimental Zone, (4) Museum, (5) Science Museum, (6) Gymnasium, Sports Hall, (7) Music Hall, (8) Academic Hall, (9) Educational Cinema, (10) Educational Theater, (11) Educational Radio Station, (12) Zoo, (13) Botanical Garden, (14) People's School, (15) Supplementary School. The allocation standards and methods are as follows: In the city center, establish a fully equipped library, public education center, museum, science museum, gymnasium, music hall, art gallery, educational cinema, educational theater, people's school, and educational stage, one of each. In the suburbs, establish one zoo and one botanical garden. In addition, in the four suburbs, establish four public education centers, libraries, public education experimental zones, central people's schools, gymnasiums, art galleries, and educational cinemas. In each park, establish a small-scale zoo. In addition to this, each district must establish a simple library, public education center, gymnasium, and science, labor, and music center, one of each. Each "bao" must also establish one people's school and one supplementary school. The bureau is currently actively promoting the above plan. It is expected to be completed on schedule within the next five years.</p>
<h3>This Evening's Morning Friends Cup Basketball Game: Hua Lian Meets Chen Bai</h3>
<p>The Morning Friends Cup basketball game will be held today starting at 6:00 PM, with three games in the A and B groups, still at the Eight Immortals Overseas Chinese Youth Association Gymnasium. However, due to the conflict between the police station and the vendors near the Youth Association in the past two days, the order has been quite chaotic. As of press time, the authorities have not yet announced whether it can be held tonight. Among the three games, the final game is expected to be the most exciting. However, the Hua Lian team members are scattered. Filipino players Cai Wenhua and Zhang Zhengyi have already accompanied the Qingbai team to Hong Kong this morning. There are rumors that Da Li is tired of playing, and A Di is working for Ren Yu. According to general speculation, it is possible that they will forfeit. However, A Kong and others are doing their best to mediate, and they are still a strong enemy for Yong Youbai.</p>
<p>Chen Youbai is the incarnation of Ren Yu, and their condition has been quite good recently. In the Morning Friends Cup, they have the ambition to win the championship. Players such as Yao Wenyi and Shen Juju are clear-headed. They are rare and promising talents. However, the main player, Wang Huaiding, went to Ning Tong a few days ago. It is certain that he will not return today. If Hua Lian forfeits, then the Chen Youbai has already secured the Group A championship. Today's order is as follows:</p>
<p>You Yi - Yu Guang (Yi Chen) 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Lian Qing - Chen Youlan (Yi You) 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Hua Lian - Chen Youbai (Group A) 7:30 PM</p>
<p>Football Game Postponed Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, it rained heavily all day, and outdoor sports were all hindered. All matches of the football league were also postponed. The football scene was quiet and uneventful.</p>
<h3>Basketball Committee Resolution: Second League Begins on New Year's Day; Registration Begins on the 9th of This Month and Closes on the 20th; Approves Qingbai and Hu Xing Teams to Go to Hong Kong</h3>

Their basketball skills will be limited to the level of Group B (those with basketball skills above the level of Group B will be included in Group A). At the time of registration, the person in charge of each manufacturer must certify that their team members are indeed employees of their business, in order to show the limitation.</p>
<p>(3) The application of the Qingbai and Hu Xing basketball teams to go to Hong Kong to compete was approved.</p>
<p>(4) The Western Youth Sports Department sent a letter requesting the association to hold a charity competition to help impoverished children.

<h3>The Problem of Implementing Electrified Education</h3>
<p>— Du Weitao</p>
<p>1.  Introducing the Problem</p>
<p>Electrified education has been implemented in our country for ten years. In the beginning, the promotion was very smooth. The Ministry of Education advocated and led from above, and the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, as well as other educational institutions, worked hard to promote it from below. For applied equipment, some could be manufactured domestically, and importing from abroad was not difficult, and the price was not very expensive, so it was very popular. If it had not encountered the misfortune of the eight-year war of resistance, it should have been popularized in schools at all levels, social education institutions, and the general public throughout the country long ago. After the start of the war of resistance, the original institutions promoting electrified education gradually withdrew and merged, the loss and damage of equipment was great, and it was impossible to replenish it in large quantities. Prices were high, and sources were lacking, making it more difficult year by year. Although every method was tried, it was impossible to maintain it. However, from an objective point of view, it was needed more and more each year. During the eight years, electrified education was also able to shoulder the mission of the war of resistance, and its value was greatly increased. Everywhere there was such a warm welcome and urgent expectation, making our few staff members feel unable to cope. It was clear that electrified education was so needed and so effective that we really couldn't bear to give up our only old equipment, and we had to endure extreme hardship and do our best. In this way, there was no problem with the implementation of electrified education in the objective aspect. Schools and the public were increasing their demands day by day. The excessive difficulty lay only in the lack of equipment, shortage of funds, and shortage of personnel. However, today, the situation has changed somewhat. In addition to material difficulties, there are also psychological difficulties. Material difficulties are easy to solve, but psychological difficulties are not easy to overcome. After the victory of the war of resistance, the source of equipment will not be a problem. The problem is whether there are funds to buy it. The amount of funds depends on whether the supervisors at all levels are willing to allocate them. As for whether a large number of talents can be cultivated after the war, it also depends on the decision of the supervisors at all levels. In the end, the fundamental problem now is that the educational administrative organs at all levels do not attach importance to this education! They do not have a deep understanding of the objective needs, and they do not fully understand the great functions of electrified education, so they put it at the very end of all educational undertakings. It can be said that the reason why electrified education cannot be developed is not because there is no way to solve the problems of equipment, funds, and talents, but because it is placed in the last position and has no opportunity to raise its head. I say this, and most people engaged in electrified education and social education work will agree. Therefore, the first problem in implementing electrified education is to break through the psychological difficulties. As long as the educational administrative organs at all levels are determined to promote electrified education and can attach importance to electrified education, then the difficulties of equipment, funds, and talents can be easily solved.</p>
<p>2.  The Process of Implementation</p>
<p>Electrified education was promoted and advocated by people who were enthusiastic about science education and social education more than ten years ago. It was first experimented and promoted in several science education and social education groups, and developed from the Beijing-Shanghai area to the south and north. The earliest implementation was carried out in the Zhenjiang and Xuzhou Public Education Centers in Jiangsu Province, and it was very successful. Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi also gradually developed. In schools, Jinling University, Daxia University, and Jiangsu Provincial Education College promoted it earlier and achieved good results. At that time, magic lanterns, movies, and broadcasting were used as teaching tools, and many places could independently produce educational films. Zhenjiang Public Education Center first used cars to implement electrified education, which is still envied today. Jinling University first established an educational film department and created an electrified education specialty to train electrified education talents. Jiangsu Provincial Education College also established an electrified education specialty in 1936. The Ministry of Education, in view of the importance of the electrified education cause, began to lead, supervise, and promote it in 1935. It purchased a large number of various film and broadcasting equipment and distributed it to educational institutions in various provinces for application. Two committees, a film education committee and a broadcasting education committee, were established within the ministry, and electrified education personnel training courses were opened, with a total of three sessions, and 322 graduates were trained. After the start of the War of Resistance, the two committees merged into the Electrified Education Committee, and a third section was established in the Department of Social Education to handle electrified education. In 1942, the China Educational Film Studio was established to produce 16mm educational films, and an electrified education specialty was established in the National Social Education College to train talents. Each province established an Electrified Education Service Office (reorganized into a counseling office after the war) in the Department of Education, and also established an Electrified Education Traveling Work Team, with as many as seven or eight teams and as few as two or three teams. Most schools and social education institutions were equipped with radios, and a small number of provinces planned to establish educational broadcasting stations. The promotion of electrified education was all the rage in the short two or three years before the war. After the start of the War of Resistance, although the electrified education institutions and equipment in various provinces were gradually damaged and reduced, the Ministry of Education still tried to subsidize and maintain them. In the absence of any other way, they tried to find a way and organized ministry-affiliated electrified education teams to directly promote teaching work. The National Social Education College's electrified education specialty was once changed to an independent electrified education technical school, but it returned to its original state due to the difficulty of equipment, funds, and talents. The China Film Studio worked hard for several years and completed 50 films, which can be regarded as having exhausted its ability. In the last year or two of the War of Resistance, the promotion of electrified education reached the most difficult and tightest period. The Electrified Education Committee of the Ministry of Education was abolished, and only the third section of the Department of Social Education handled electrified education work. However, they reorganized laws, intensified research and experimentation work, tried to find and purchase equipment at home and abroad, strengthened international cooperation, prepared a development plan for the aftermath, and united with the British and American News Agencies to work hard on lantern slide and film propaganda for the War of Resistance. Not only did they not neglect their work in these most difficult two years, but they also laid the foundation for post-war development. In this way, the people in the electrified education positions have done their best in the implementation of electrified education. Now that the opportunity has improved, they can make great achievements. However, they need enthusiastic people in electrified education and in the work positions to carry out extensive propaganda and vigorous promotion.</p>
<p>3.  Future Efforts</p>
<p>The matters we are working on now are to continue to lay the foundation for electrified education, improve the status of electrified education, and expand the financial resources of electrified education, so that the preparation of equipment, the increase of institutions and personnel, and the training of talents can all advance simultaneously. However, we can still discover by reviewing past gains and losses. In the past, one of the biggest mistakes was to treat electrified education as administrative work too much. Everything was relying on the government to support it, there was no foundation at the lower level, the people did not participate in this cause, and businessmen did not care about it at all. This is exactly the opposite of the most developed electrified education in Britain and the United States. China is a poor country. Every undertaking relies on the government's power. If the people and groups do not work hard on their own, how can they not have such a result? Although electrified education costs money, it does not necessarily lose money. It can make money in the future. If the people do it themselves and businessmen actively invest, there is no need to worry about the market. For example, publishing, news media, and broadcasting are all educational and cultural undertakings. Even if the government wants to supervise and manage them, they are all social undertakings and also a kind of enterprise. The manufacture of film, broadcasting, and magic lantern equipment is an industry. Applying it to teach is a social undertaking. The people should strive to create and run it themselves, and then the government will supervise and assist it. If this is done, it would have developed long ago. Just look at the educational films in Britain and the United States, which are all produced by various film companies. The film and broadcasting equipment used in schools and educational institutions are self-provided, not issued by the higher-level educational administrative organs. The government has not put much effort into promoting and developing these undertakings. Although the situation in our country is different from that in Britain and the United States, we cannot but have the government lead the way first. However, the cause of electrified education cannot rely solely on the government's power to promote it as a political decree. This principle is always correct! Speaking of this, let's turn back and hope that the government will still pay more attention to promoting this educational undertaking when the people and local areas do not have the power to run it themselves, especially at present, it is necessary to determine the direction and formulate policies first to make a kind of promotion, and then expect the people and local areas to do it automatically. At the same time, I also hope that educational people in general will work harder from the lower level and use their own strength to do their own business. Not only should the electrified education undertaking be like this, but all undertakings for building the country should be like this. (Written on November 30, 1946, at the Ministry of Education)</p>

<h3>Inspecting Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces</h3>
<p>— November 24th Air Mail Report from Our Kaifeng Reporter Wang Shoumei</p>
<p>Leaving Shacheng Lightly Equipped</p>
<p>On the morning of November 16th, as the gentle morning sun of Sui shone across the land, the jeep of the reporter from Lai quickly arrived at my door. Councilor Yin from the 68th Army jumped out of the vehicle and urged me to leave. I put on my coat, grabbed my camera, and, without any luggage, lightly got into the car, sitting down next to the driver. Without any delay, the car sped off.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the car had left the ancient city of Shacheng and headed east along the flat highway towards Caozhou. The driver, Wang Mashi, the captain of the 68th Army's motor transport team, skillfully handled the car, keeping it steady and smooth on the flat road, making it feel almost like flying in the air if you closed your eyes.</p>
<p>The clear blue sky was like a pool of autumn water, still and without a ripple. There was no wind, no dust, and the entire earth was immersed in the charming morning sun. Everything on the earth seemed to be dreaming a light dream, so peaceful and mysterious that no one would believe it was a northern early winter morning!</p>
<p>Wild dogs chased after the car, but were left behind. Small birds raced with the car in the sky, but were also left behind. An endless stream of large trucks saw the jeep coming from behind and immediately yielded the way. Our jeep sped eastward like a meteor. In seventy minutes, we completed the hundred-li journey from Kaifeng to Guanfeng. After stopping in Guanfeng for forty minutes for breakfast, we got back into the car and headed northeast. Forty-five minutes later, we arrived at Kaocheng. Without stopping, we bypassed the city. Because the road was congested with vehicles transporting supplies to the front lines, our jeep had to proceed intermittently. About forty minutes after leaving Kaocheng, Brother Yin Jinghu told me that we had entered the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border area, which was formerly the Communist "Liberated Area." Upon hearing the word "liberated," I felt a sense of threat and restraint in my mind, and my eyes involuntarily looked around. However, the road here was wide and flat, and the farmers in the fields were still working peacefully. But I only saw smoke from cooking fires and no village trees. The birds in the sky seemed particularly few. I was wondering when the driver, Captain Wang, pointed out to me: "Not long ago, our Third Army encountered the Communist forces here. Although the smell of blood is gone, the unburied bodies are often dragged onto the road by wild dogs. The first time I drove through here, there were dead people everywhere, and you couldn't see a single person in the villages." I felt a chill run down my spine. I knew I had stepped into the "present battlefield." I had no mourning thoughts, only a sense of terror. I was afraid to see the corpses of those who had died unjustly, and I was afraid to smell the piercing stench of blood. I closed my eyes, covered my nose, and hoped that the car would quickly drive me through this terrible area.</p>
<p>Strict Guard at Diaozhuang</p>
<p>Around two o'clock, the car arrived at Diaozhuang, fifty li from Caozhou. It was a small village, but it had defensive fortifications like a net from the sky. On the newly built stockade walls, there was a pillbox every three steps and a fort every five steps. Logs and rolling stones were scattered on the top of the walls. Outside the stockade walls was a deep ditch filled with river water. Outside the ditch was a barrier made of thorns, tightly surrounding the ditch. Outside this barrier, there were two more layers of walls made of short wooden stakes. The three layers of walls surrounded the deep ditch, and the deep water encircled the solid stockade walls. Our car passed through the innermost barrier. The sentries on the stockade walls, with their round eyes peeking out from under their helmets, stared at the travelers on the road. The moment the sentry's eyes fell on me, my nerves involuntarily twitched. I asked Councilor Yin why the guard was so tight here. He said it was an important stronghold. In the villages not far from here, there were still sporadic Communist forces lurking, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, so they had to take special precautions. The six or seven armed soldiers in the car all pushed bullets into their rifles and fixed their bayonets. They watched the pedestrians on the road until the car drove far away, then they looked for new targets. At that moment, I felt like I was on the battlefield.</p>
<p>At three o'clock, the car finally arrived safely in Caozhou.</p>
<p>A Hasty Look at Caozhou</p>
<p>"Caozhou" is a historical geographical name. It is no longer Caozhou Prefecture but Heze County. In the Spring and Autumn period, it was the State of Cao. During the Qing Dynasty, it was the seat of Caozhou Prefecture. In the Republic of China, it was renamed Heze County because of the abundant water of Heze. In the past, due to its important geographical location and abundant resources, it became a leader in politics, economy, and culture in western Shandong. It was an important town in western Shandong with a glorious history and a brilliant position. It nurtured prominent figures in Chinese history. Most of the heroes in the Water Margin were from here. We should not forget General Zhao Dengyu, who was the first to sacrifice his life for the country in the epic of the Anti-Japanese War. His home was in Heze County.</p>
<p>This is indeed a good place, but now it has become like a pear blossom after the rain, a beauty that has been devastated. Many of the ancient and magnificent buildings have lost their doors and windows. The prosperity of the past has been reduced to desolation. Although there are a few shops on the streets, they are often closed. Even if they are open, they are just empty shells. However, the small vendors selling glass combs in the streets are soliciting customers. However, even in this famine-stricken land where it is difficult to survive, they cannot help but fold their arms and sit on the sidelines. There are no restaurants offering packaged banquets, only small restaurants selling steamed buns and noodles. Pedestrians are scarce, and the nights are even more desolate. If it weren't for the trucks from the rear supply agencies coming and going, you would think this was a dead city. This historical ancient city usually has a population of more than 40,000. After being occupied by the Communist forces on September 24th last year, two-thirds of the population fled. When the Communist forces retreated on August 24th this year, another third was forced to leave. When the National Army recovered this ancient city, there were almost no people left in the city. According to an old man who believed in Catholicism, "When the Communist forces retreated, they forced the people to fill in the wells and forced them to flee. No one wanted to fill in the wells, and everyone was watching and didn't want to leave. They threatened, saying, 'If you don't leave, the National Army will kill you all.' The people were uneducated, so they all fled. When the National Army entered the city, no one knew how many old men and women there were in the whole city. But soon, those who had fled gradually returned. Now there are more than 30,000 people in the city. This must be attributed to General Liu Ruzhen. After General Liu Ruzhen stationed in Caozhou, he comforted the refugees, provided relief, bought seeds for the farmers, repaired houses for the residents, and maintained strict military discipline, which was widely praised. As a result, those who had fled to other places returned with their families."</p>
<p>The walls of the streets and alleys are covered with slogans written in red characters on a white background. But under the new slogans are the old slogans, and under the old slogans is an even more blurred layer of slogans. The new slogans were written by the National Army, the old slogans were written by the Communist forces, and the most blurred slogans at the bottom were written by the enemy and puppets. The three layers of slogans represent three periods, which shows what kind of life the people of Caozhou have been living in recent years.</p>
<p>Before the war, this was the most educationally and culturally developed place in Shandong Province. The provincial normal school and provincial high school were the best in Shandong. Even the elementary schools were very well run, because this used to be an experimental county in Shandong, so there were almost no out-of-school children here. But now, this city of culture doesn't even have a school. The school buildings have collapsed, the weeds are overgrown, and there are school-age children everywhere. Moreover, there is no preparation or hope for reopening in the near future. This is so heartbreaking and terrible!</p>
<p>The city walls here were demolished by the National Army at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War. During the enemy and puppet period, the people were forced to rebuild them. Last year, after the enemy surrendered and the Communist forces occupied the city, they forced the people to tear them down again. This time, after the National Army recovered the city, the people, under the leadership of the National Army, rebuilt the ten-li-long city walls in two months, and they were rebuilt exceptionally strong and magnificent. Cars can almost drive on the city walls. Outside the city walls is a deep ditch. The difficulty of the project and the greatness of human power cannot be considered a miracle. When General Liu Ruzhen accompanied the reporter on a tour around the city, he said with great emotion: "To mobilize such a large civilian force and do such a large project to defend against internal unrest is a great injustice and waste. If the Communist forces laid down their butcher knives and we returned to our fields, and the people used this great power entirely in production, how much would we harvest?" I nodded and sighed. An old man who was repairing the city walls said while working, "General, it doesn't matter. We ordinary people don't have anything else, just a little bit of stupid strength. As long as the National Army can protect this city forever after we rebuild it once, and not let us tear it down and rebuild it again, we will be endlessly grateful." The reporter looked at General Liu Ruzhen, who smiled at the old man.</p>

<h3>County Magistrate Discusses the Red Terror</h3>
<p>Heze is now the location of the Commissioner's Office of the Sixteenth District of Shandong. The county government and the Commissioner's Office operate independently. To understand the military, political, and economic measures taken during the period when the Communist army occupied this area, the reporter interviewed Commissioner Zhu and County Magistrate Zhang separately. County Magistrate Zhang is a local and has served as a district chief in the past. He is now the county magistrate and concurrently the secretary-general of the Party branch, so he is very familiar with the local situation. According to him, soon after the Communist army occupied Heze, the "Jilu豫 Border Region Government" established an administrative office in Daoli. Heze was changed to a municipality, and the area within the county seat and Dikou was placed under the jurisdiction of Heze Municipality. The former Heze County was divided into four counties: Heze, Nanhua, Linze, and Qibin. The so-called "Jilu豫 Border Region" was under the jurisdiction of the "Jinji魯豫 Border Region Government" (located in Handan). In addition to this, it also included the Taihang, Taiyue, and Jinan Border Regions. It included the area south of the Dushi Railway, east of the Pinghan Railway, north of the Longhai Railway, and west of the Jinpu Railway. In terms of the administrative organization of the administrative office, there were four departments: civil affairs, finance, construction, and education, and three bureaus: industry and commerce, transportation, and public security. With the strengthening of the Communist army's ruling power, farmers' associations, women's associations, and children's corps were also established. In the countryside, the Communist army first sent "Anti-Japanese Associations." These were their organizational personnel. They single-handedly created farmers' associations and then organized "gun squads." This was the most important step, ostensibly to use local forces to protect the area, but in reality, it was the grassroots work of expanding the Communist army. After a period of "processing" by them, the peasants were forced to join the Communist army. More than 90% of those who died in battle in various places were these Communist soldiers who had joined the army after being "processed." The last time the Communist army attacked eastern Henan, there were casualties everywhere, and they were all kind people from here. Therefore, the elderly, weak, women, and children here will never forget the hatred of the Communist army, and the tricks of the Communist army will never fool them again. The Communist Party also established many cooperatives here, and their staff members also engaged in business for profit. However, their cigarette factories monopolized the market, and their factories enjoyed exclusive rights. Businessmen suffered unspeakable hardships but were still not allowed to close their doors. If you closed down, they would take all the merchant's houses, goods, and furniture for their own use "for the sake of production." Under such industrial and commercial policies, a phenomenon of commercial depression and economic collapse was created. This situation cannot be recovered in three to five years.</p>
<p>The reporter then asked County Magistrate Zhang what the county government had done after the county seat was recovered. He said, "After the Communist army left, the county government mainly focused on pacifying the refugees. Immediately afterward came the disputes left behind by the Communist army regarding land, property, marriage, and grievances. These cases have kept the county government very busy. The county government is still busy with these matters. For example, land was 'struggled' and divided at that time. The ownership still belonged to the landlords, but some landlords sold their land to others to pay the 'struggle' fines, which is troublesome. There are many cases of retaliation, but we always try to reconcile them unless the cases are particularly serious. Because those criminals who were exploited are all local bullies, hooligans, and ignorant wretches. We don't want them to form new grudges and repeat the tragedy."</p>
<p>Shedding Tears While Talking About "Struggle"</p>
<p>In the "Liberated Areas," the slogan of "struggle" was prevalent everywhere. Only through "struggle" could the poor "share the money," and only through "struggle" could the slaves "turn over." This was the Communist Party's consistent propaganda program. How exactly was "struggle" carried out? The reporter can answer the readers with a statement from Mr. Zhao, the owner of a bathhouse here. He is a kind and honest old man of sixty. He did not escape during the Communist army's occupation and, like many who did not escape, was "struggled" twice. He said, "After the Communist army entered the city, I didn't escape for the sake of my family and my business. I was arrested, my home was robbed clean, my children were also arrested, and my business was suspended. I wanted to die, but I couldn't. Those local bullies, hooligans, rascals, and shrewish women all became important people. The Communist army gathered these people together to 'struggle' against the honest people. Although I feel sorry for them now, they were simple-minded at the time and, with the support of the 'Anti-Japanese Association' and 'cadre class,' did commit a lot of evil. They did plant unforgettable hatred in the hearts of ordinary people." "How exactly was the 'struggle' carried out?" I asked him. He continued, "The Communist army's 'struggle' meeting was prepared and mobilized for a long time. To 'struggle' against someone, the 'Anti-Japanese Association' would first instruct the 'cadre class' and then instruct the 'farmers' association' to mobilize 'members' to fabricate the crimes of the person being 'struggled.' Under threat and inducement, they turned this into a double act. I was 'struggled' on February 11th this year. That day, they gathered hundreds of people, even the tea boys in my bathhouse were brought there. First, they pushed me onto the stage, and then a staff member of the 'cadre class' asked loudly to the people below the stage why they wanted to 'struggle' against me. Some people below the stage said that I had beaten and scolded them before, and some said that I had borrowed money from them before and didn't lend it to them. He then asked the tea boys in my bathhouse how I had abused them. Those children didn't say anything, so he slapped them twice. Then he kicked me down on the stage and asked me to 'confess, confess.' I hadn't done anything wrong, so of course, I didn't say anything. But at this time, those children's corps, under coercion, urinated on my face. The staff member of the 'cadre class' even shouted at me to open my mouth, so I had to do it. One finished urinating, then another urinated. I don't know how much I drank. Later, I heard that if I didn't confess, they would sentence me to death in public, so I had to shout loudly. I said I was a 'bastard,' I said I 'exploited the poor,' I said I 'abused apprentices.' At this time, the crowd below the stage shouted in unison under a kind of manipulation: 'Beat him to death!' 'Sanction him!' I lowered my head, waiting for their disposal. Carelessly, with a 'thud,' a raw egg was thrown on my face. The egg white and yolk ran all over my face, but I wasn't allowed to wipe it off. There was a burst of laughter below the stage. After a while, a paper hat was put on my head. They tied me up and paraded me through the streets, parading through the main streets and alleys of the city. I was hoarse from shouting that I was a 'bastard.' That night, they wanted to fine me. The amount they wanted was two million. Because I didn't have money, they took over my bathhouse, but I couldn't sell it. In the end, I chose to sell it to them, but I didn't see any cash. They said it had been allocated." At this point, he burst into tears and couldn't bear to recount it further. After a long time, I asked him again, "Under such 'struggle,' how did the old people in the city and countryside feel about the Communist army?" He said, "Regardless of whether they were poor or rich, everyone was terrified. At that time, some songs said:</p>
<p>—One or two acres stand in front of the door, three or four acres are criminals, five acres or more are big bastards, those without houses and land are immortals—</p>
<p>—The rooster has a long tail, the chairman of the farmers' association is Yama, if you say no, you will suffer—</p>
<p>—A tree, bare and bright, riding a big horse back to his hometown, the house is collapsed, the grain is finished, parents shed tears when they see him—</p>
<p>—A white tree, blooms white flowers, the Eighth Route Army comes and ransacks the house—</p>
<p>—The Eighth Route Army makes a lot of noise, they are afraid to charge when they see the devils, they are afraid to move during the day, they come out and show off at night, grab the ladies for military rations, grab the sisters-in-law for clothes—</p>
<p>—The Eighth Route Army loves money, they try their best to get it when they see the rich, the rich say no, and immediately get the 'stubborn' hat—</p>
<p>After listening to these songs, you will know the situation of the people at that time."</p>

<h3>General Zhao's Old Mother Picks Cotton in the Courtyard, Her Old Age is Desolate</h3>
<p>General Zhao Dengyu used his fresh blood to write the first page of the history of the War of Resistance. His loyal soul is forever buried underground, his heroic name will forever remain in the world, what about his family after his death? Now that the reporter has come to the general's hometown, he cannot but visit the general's family. The general's house is in the northwest corner of the city, a semi-old courtyard, the gate and threshold are lost, the whole courtyard is desolate, the hall is desolate, the three main rooms have collapsed in the middle, the east and west wing rooms are also like cold ancient temples, gloomy and eerie, making people feel a bit creepy when they are in it. The general has an old mother, who is already eighty years old, deaf but not blind, very old and frail, in a very pitiful state. When the reporter went, the general's mother was picking cotton in the courtyard. The reporter asked about the family's living conditions, and she told the reporter, "There is no way, it's terrible, the cattle are gone, the grain is gone, everything is over when the child dies, if it weren't for the Commander-in-Chief (referring to General Liu Ruming) sending wheat seeds and money, our family wouldn't be able to survive"! As she spoke, she only trembled. The reporter was filled with emotion and quickly took a photo of the old lady and went to the front yard. It is said that the general has a wife, a younger brother, and children, but the children have always said that the times are not good and the family is poor, so they have no opportunity to be educated. The general died for the country, and his family is like this after his death, which is truly heartbreaking and infuriating!</p>
<p>Peonies are the Best in the World</p>
<p>Caozhou peonies are the best in the world. This is the kingdom of peonies. Those who have read Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio and old Chinese novels should know that this place was famous for peonies many years ago. The number of peony varieties here is the highest in the country, and the planting area is also astonishing. The sales area extends as far as Guangdong and Southeast Asia, and as close as Pingjin, Beijing, and Shanghai. As long as there are peonies, it goes without saying that they are from Caozhou. Everyone says that Luoyang peonies are good, but who knows that Caozhou is the mother's home? The people of Caozhou are often proud of this.</p>
<p>Peony Township is located in Zhaolou, about seven miles northeast of Caozhou City. The reporter once took a jeep to go there to explore the flowers. Peony Township is about ten hectares in size, with pine and cypress forests standing tall and the environment is beautiful. It is a pity that there is no spring in the world, and the flowers do not bloom. All that can be seen is a field of fragrant tombs (peonies are naturally weak and cannot withstand the severe cold, so they are buried in winter). The reporter only sighed and lamented in the flower township for a while before reluctantly returning to the city.</p>
<p>I was entertained by General Liu Ruzhen in Caozhou for three days. On the morning of the 20th, I drove back, hurriedly, just like I came hurriedly. When I left Caozhou, I turned my head back and looked longingly at this ancient city that I had just met and parted with, until the clouds and smoke covered her face, and then I looked at my own way home.</p>
<p>Ghosts are feared, but the car broke down in Pengzhuang, a dangerous area. After repairing it for three hours in anxiety and fear, it was finally repaired. We drove at full speed and arrived in Kaocheng at 4 pm. Hungry and exhausted, we went to the headquarters of the 55th Army in Kaocheng and were entertained with fried fish by the district commander. We dared not stay long and continued on our way. It was already 4:30 when we started driving. It was 170 li to Kaifeng. The driver was anxious, and the reporter was even more anxious. There were very few people and cars on the road. A round red sun about to set was smiling nostalgically at the earth. The car chased it like a gust of wind. It sank little by little, and the car jumped forward. But in the end, it didn't catch up. It sank down, and a faint twilight scene appeared on the earth. Where is Shacheng? I tasted the two lines of poetry: "The cool breeze doesn't care about the thinness of the traveler's clothes, and the setting sun knows the difficulty of the road!"</p>
<p>When the car entered Lanfeng, it was already lit up with thousands of lights. There was no way but to visit General Liu Ruming, Commander of the Fourth Pacification Zone. The business card was handed in, and General Liu personally greeted me with a smile and said, "I received a call from the 55th Army and knew that you would definitely stay here tonight. I have been waiting for you for a long time!" At this time, I couldn't help but smile too. After eating dinner, I talked with General Liu for two hours. He recounted his experiences of joining the army in his youth, leading troops in his prime, guarding the dangerous Nankou alone, and relieving the siege of Xi'an on horseback, as if he was reciting family treasures. He made me feel completely relieved of my exhaustion. I was very interested in this elegant general. Finally, he urged me to go to bed, and I went to sleep.</p>
<p>Gunfire in the Middle of the Night</p>
<p>In my sleep, I was suddenly awakened by dense machine gun fire. I was confused and didn't know what to do. Deputy Director Yang knew that I had been awakened and was afraid that I was timid, so he kept telling me, "It's okay, it's okay, don't panic." But he himself held the telephone receiver in his hand and asked everywhere, but no one knew what was going on. The gunfire was intermittent, and the news came in fragments. Finally, I learned that in the area of Zhangliangfen, five or six li west of the city, the National Army found the Communist army destroying the railway and opened machine guns to drive the Communist army away. A false alarm, fortunately, there was no harm done. I fell asleep again.</p>
<p>The next morning, General Liu prepared Western food for me. While having breakfast, he told me that tens of thousands of Communist troops had gathered in the Dongming and Changyuan areas and were brewing a new war. They would definitely try to make a desperate gamble against our defense zone again. Now, we have new deployments. If they really want to run into a wall, then we can only eliminate them with pain. I followed his finger and looked at the map, but I was thinking in my heart: The violent storm is about to come again, what is the crime of the people?</p>
<p>When I got in the car to Kaifeng, it was already twelve o'clock.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Siam</h3>
<p>—Bangkok Air News on the 14th, by Huang Shusun, Traveling Reporter for This Newspaper</p>
<p>Siamese Schools Add Chinese Classes</p>
<p>There are more than 10,000 overseas Chinese abroad, and Siam accounts for one-third. Whether it is in large cities or small towns, whether it is in poor villages or remote areas, they are everywhere, living there and passing on from generation to generation. Overseas Chinese control 95% of industry and commerce. If you are there for the first time, you really can't believe that this is foreign land.</p>
<p>In the year or so since the end of the war, in various parts of Southeast Asia, either the turmoil has not ended or the anti-Chinese sentiment has become increasingly strong. Only Siam is more stable. With the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Siam, the status of overseas Chinese has been significantly improved. They now have complete freedom to hold meetings, form associations, and publish. The Siamese also look at the overseas Chinese with new eyes. Former Prime Minister Nai Biri, who was known for his anti-Chinese sentiment, visited China and paid homage to the President. Many descendants of overseas Chinese have recognized their ancestry. The Siamese Minister of Education encourages Siamese schools to add Chinese classes. In various cities in the mainland, and even many Siamese officials, send their children to Chinese schools to study and use Chinese names. They often enthusiastically participate in public welfare undertakings held in the overseas Chinese community or donate money to help. The various harsh regulations promulgated during the period when Phibun was in power, although they have not yet been completely abolished by formal order, have long been stopped in practice.</p>
<p>Due to the restrictions of the Anglo-Siamese Agreement, Siam's main products, such as rice and timber, are either forcibly purchased or prohibited from export, resulting in economic stagnation and commercial depression. This not only affects Siam's entire national fortune but is also a major blow to our Chinese overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Extortion and Blackmail According to Law</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese have always been seen as gods of wealth, and many people think they are weak and can be bullied. During the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia, due to the abundance of Siam's products, and at the same time, Siam still maintained a trace of free trade, there were many who made fortunes. This opened the door for officials from the motherland. First, there was Lan, then Xing and Li. They all used the name of "punishing traitors" to threaten and extort those who made fortunes during the war. Nine out of ten of those who made fortunes during the war had engaged in collaborating with the enemy, aiding the enemy, and serving the enemy. In their fear and trepidation, they wanted to use money to cover up their bad deeds. The officials got what they wanted, and each took nearly 10 million baht in Siamese currency and a large number of gold bars to enjoy themselves. At present, this wind of extortion and blackmail has not subsided. For example, the release of more than 100 overseas Chinese required 1 million baht in Siamese currency, and the negotiator got 300,000 baht. There are countless people who use false names to make money in Siam. This is a joke overseas. The central authorities of our country recently made a resolution to organize an overseas roving supervisory team. Overseas Chinese all hope that it will be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Three Mores Plus Three Mores</p>
<p>"Many monks, many temples, many women." These are Siam's original "three mores." After the war, the overseas Chinese community in Siam added "three mores": "many overseas Chinese leaders, many parties, many newspapers." These "three mores" are all mutually causal and related. In the early days of Japan's surrender, those who had engaged in collaborating with the enemy, aiding the enemy, and serving the enemy knew that their sins were serious, so they either hid or claimed to be dead to avoid attention. Later, with the power of money, they were able to show their faces again and swaggered in the overseas Chinese community, pretending to be "overseas Chinese leaders." Those so-called "overseas Chinese leaders" mostly had different opinions, set up their own houses, and ambitious and shameless people attached themselves to them, often claiming to belong to a certain "party" or becoming a certain "faction." They often slandered each other, and even fought each other or carried out assassinations. The so-called "overseas Chinese leaders" and certain "parties" and "factions," under the attack and condemnation of overseas Chinese, took money out of their own pockets to start newspapers as a tool to speak and defend themselves. For example, Zhang Lanchen, Chen Zhenjing, Chen Yongqiang, and others are all well-known traitors. In particular, Zhang Lanchen collected more than 100,000 overseas Chinese workers and sent them to build the Siam-Burma Railway for the enemy. Those who died of abuse and disease numbered in the hundreds of thousands. The ghosts cried and howled, which was extremely tragic. More than 3 million overseas Chinese all wanted to eat his flesh and sleep on his skin. Their official newspapers even called him "meritorious in the underground work of resisting Japan."</p>
<p>Unresolved Issues Between China and Siam</p>
<p>The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Siam and the arrival of the envoys made overseas Chinese extremely excited. Everyone placed their hopes on Ambassador Li, hoping that he could fight for the overseas Chinese. However, the embassy has been established for two months, and many important outstanding issues between China and Siam have not been negotiated and resolved. Ambassador Li is busy with social events and socializing, dancing parties and evening parties, with almost no time to spare.</p>
<p>The Highest Institution of Learning for Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>More than 300 Chinese schools have resumed classes one after another. However, the lack of teachers has become the most serious problem. Many intellectuals with real talent and learning fled the country during the period when Phibun was in power and when the Japanese occupied Siam. Therefore, at this time, anyone who knows a little bit and has an "overseas Chinese leader" to speak for him or a friend to recommend him can fill the position without qualification. Take Zhonghua Middle School, for example, this is the highest institution of learning for overseas Chinese in Siam. Because of the lack of teachers and the incompetence of the person in charge, there is nothing to show for it. Overseas Chinese education in Siam is still waiting for revival, and the cultural garden of overseas Chinese in Siam is still waiting to be cultivated. May educators and cultural figures from the motherland enthusiastically go south!</p>
<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>Viewing National Reconstruction from the Perspective of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>— Jiang Junzhang</p>
<p>The Sino-American Commercial Treaty was officially signed in Nanjing on November 4th. The full text of the treaty, consisting of thirty articles, has been published, along with an appended protocol clarifying certain terms listed in the treaty as an attachment. Since the abolition of unequal treaties, this is considered the first commercial treaty China has signed with an industrially advanced friendly nation. Therefore, the people of the whole nation are paying close attention to this treaty, and many are expressing their opinions and criticisms. We can summarize the opinions from all sides into two aspects: praise and criticism. The praise mostly consists of stating that this treaty is an equal and reciprocal one, which we need not quote at length. The criticisms mostly assert that this treaty will turn China into an economic appendage of the United States. The rights given to China by the United States, it is said, cannot be utilized by China due to insufficient national strength. On the other hand, the rights given to the United States by China will be fully utilized by the United States due to its superior national strength, material resources, and manpower. As a result, it will become a one-sided preference rather than an equal reciprocity. A Mr. Ma Qilun even said, "This commercial treaty is the precursor to a large-scale American economic invasion." We dare not criticize the right or wrong of these statements, and there is actually no need to do so. However, we must specifically point out that both China and the United States have their respective needs in entering into such a commercial treaty during this period. What does the United States need? It is the so-called transfer and maintenance of wartime industrial prosperity and full employment of the people. What does China need? It is to build the dilapidated China into a prosperous, strong, and happy nation. This is a major undertaking that China must accomplish in the next few years. Large-scale national reconstruction requires sufficient materials and excellent technology. However, how can China, which is originally backward and has been at war for a long time, solve the problems of capital, equipment, and technology required for reconstruction? Under this need, the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was established.</p>
<p>(1) The First Phase of Economic Construction Principles and the Sino-American Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>We know that the reconstruction of rehabilitated countries in the world has taken place in three different ways: one is the Turkish style, one is the Soviet style, and one is the method of the three South American countries. Before World War I, Turkey was like China before, heavily bound by unequal treaties. After World War I, it abolished the unequal treaties. Afraid of the previous suffering, it absolutely did not enter into debt relations with foreign countries, and cautiously carried out national construction only with its own financial and material resources. Therefore, Turkey's construction progressed very slowly and was very small in scale. Before the Second World War, Turkey was still a very backward country compared to the Western powers. The Soviet Union underwent a communist revolution in the process of World War I. Later, it implemented the Five-Year Plan, using political power to control the country's agricultural products, and then exchanged these agricultural products for machinery and other necessary materials needed for national construction. It did not hesitate to pay high salaries to hire foreign technical talents. The three South American countries did not refuse to use foreign capital, and absorbed foreign capital, equipment, or technology under the principle of equality. Therefore, they achieved twice the result with half the effort in the process of national reconstruction. China's reconstruction does not adopt the Turkish method, but the method of the three South American countries. The Father of the Nation's "Industrial Plan" was based on the use of foreign capital and technology. China's more than eight years of resistance war have raised its international status, and China's contribution to world peace has also been fully recognized by friendly nations such as the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. China's post-war reconstruction is not only a problem for China itself, but also a part of the entire world peace. In particular, the United States, both the government and the public, have a particularly clear understanding of this point and are very concerned about the various problems encountered in China's reconstruction and are willing to provide the necessary assistance. In order to welcome this era and adapt to this need, China specifically passed the principles of the first phase of economic construction at the 148th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council in late December of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944]. This principle includes a total of seven points, of which three points are:</p>
<p>(1) The proportion of foreign investment in Sino-foreign joint ventures should not be subject to fixed restrictions. In addition to the chairman of the board, the selection of the general manager of the company is not limited to nationals.</p>
<p>(2) After being reviewed by the government in accordance with the general construction plan, state-owned enterprises may borrow from abroad by the competent authorities, or be invested in by foreign countries. Private enterprises may also negotiate on their own and submit them to the competent authorities for approval and record.</p>
<p>(4) Foreigners who directly invest in and operate businesses in China shall abide by Chinese laws and regulations. Special businesses must be licensed to operate, and must first be submitted to our government for review and approval.</p>
<p>This was China's own preparation before the end of the war. The original Chinese laws, such as company law, etc., which are related to economic construction and conflict with the above principles, must be revised by the Legislative Yuan to avoid hindering the progress of attracting foreign investment. The Chinese government is doing such work in advance, but it is only seeing the possible trends in the international community and removing all obstacles first. After all, there is still a big gap between this and the actual work of absorbing foreign capital to engage in construction, because it cannot be realized without the actual assistance of friendly nations. The Sino-American Commercial Treaty can be said to be a formal recognition of China's economic construction principles receiving practical assistance from the United States, and another layer of obstacles to the inflow of American capital, equipment, and technology into China has been removed. We can say that because of the establishment of this treaty, China's policy of attracting foreign investment to engage in large-scale economic construction has been advanced another step.</p>
<p>(2) Formal Equality and Practical Significance</p>
<p>The main purpose of both parties to the Sino-American Commercial Treaty is to solve their respective current major problems, and what is manifested in form is equality and reciprocity. As stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 2, the form of equality is fully expressed, that is, according to the regulations of this article, Americans can engage in or operate businesses, manufacturing...etc. in China, and Chinese people also have these rights in the United States. Americans have the right to build or lease houses, etc. in China because they engage in these businesses, and Chinese people also have these rights in the United States; only two points need to be noted: First, occupations exclusively reserved for nationals of the host country are not within the scope of business; second, all businesses operated must comply with the laws and regulations promulgated by the legal authorities of the host country, including future promulgations. This form is implemented throughout the Sino-American Commercial Treaty. On the surface, it is naturally equal, but in practice, because the United States is an industrially advanced country and China is a poor and backward country, and has been devastated by a long-term war, there is a world of difference compared to the United States in terms of science, technology, equipment, and capital. Therefore, the rights and preferential examples set in the Sino-American Commercial Treaty must be enjoyed more by Americans, and what our Chinese people enjoy must be extremely limited, and it is actually extremely unequal. This is the focus of criticism of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty by general critics. It is based on the form expressed by the commercial treaty, and it can be said that the true meaning of the commercial treaty is not thoroughly understood.</p>
<p>We have already said that China needs large-scale industrial development, especially China after more than eight years of long-term resistance war, it is really full of devastation, and everything is waiting to be done. Our people, except for a few who made war fortunes and corrupt officials and merchants who received property, have all reached the point of being unable to afford adequate clothing and having difficulty making a living. Since the people are poor, the national treasury is of course also empty, not to mention the national treasury that has been excessively burdened for a long time? Therefore, the construction funds that we can raise ourselves are very limited! When we look at the world situation again, it really does not allow us to raise funds at our leisure and slowly develop industries. Since we need a large amount of foreign capital and welcome a large amount of foreign capital to build our country, how can we impose various restrictions or open the door for foreign capital inflow very small, and not give the rights to build houses and lease land needed for the construction of factories? Other issues related to foreign capital inflow, such as debt recovery, property protection and disposal, inheritance of estates, application of patents and trademarks, levying of taxes, and fair implementation of conscription and control of overseas Chinese, if not properly resolved one by one, will somewhat hinder our goal of attracting foreign investment for national construction. The current China is like a person who needs recuperation and nourishment after recovering from a serious illness so that he can restore his health in order to engage in work. A certain amount of expenses is required during the recuperation period, and he cannot raise it himself. Although it is out of borrowing, it is also a way out of no way. As long as there is a way to borrow, it is considered a way. Never stick to the concept of balanced income and expenditure, and never borrow debt that can be borrowed, but let this newly healed patient work himself to pay for the expenses of recuperation and nourishment! The Sino-American Commercial Treaty will inevitably have unequal facts, but our purpose is construction, just like a newly healed patient needs to borrow money to take tonic, which is the only way out of no way.</p>
<p>In addition, we must pay attention to three points: First, the validity period of this commercial treaty is five years. We know that President Chiang's book "China's Destiny" put forward a five-year construction plan. These two periods are not coincidental; Second, this commercial treaty still maintains a reserved attitude towards the rights to explore and develop mineral resources, and only stipulates that when given to "nationals, legal persons or groups of any third country, this right shall also be governed by the relevant laws and regulations currently or in the future implemented by the legally constituted authorities (if there are such laws and regulations) to bind nationals, legal persons or groups of the other party". Here we can see how cautious the country is in attracting foreign investment in the development rights of mineral resources! Third, every time the commercial treaty involves a right, it must state "should be in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations currently or in the future implemented by the legally constituted authorities", which means that if there are malpractices in attracting foreign investment, laws and regulations can be used to remedy them, which has the effect of preventing problems before they occur, and can be said to be very thorough.</p>
<p>(3) Conclusion</p>
<p>In short, the root of the establishment of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty is that China wants to carry out the great cause of national construction, while the United States wants to find a way out for its surplus capital and materials, and their respective purposes are on the back of the paper, but what is expressed is a set of equality and reciprocity. Therefore, our scholars and critics have based their arguments on the future occurrence of unequal facts, which has led to misunderstandings and deviations; if we look at the significance of this treaty from the perspective of construction, and then understand the key links in the treaty, we can know that this treaty is beneficial to the future of our country.</p>
<p>The period of five years is easy to pass. Just look at the fact that more than a year has passed since Japan's surrender? In this year, what foundation has our country laid for the great cause of national construction? As of now, the achievements are still very few. The establishment of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty is only a part of the broad scope of national construction. Another more important foundation is the creation of a national construction environment, which still has no clue. If this situation continues, then although the commercial treaty has been established, the progress of national construction will still be difficult, and the original intention of the treaty will inevitably be impossible to realize. This is the most terrible thing!</p>
<h3>West Lake in the Cold Wind</h3>
<p>— November 30th, Hangzhou News, Our Hangzhou Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>In early winter, West Lake shivered from a cold wind, and then there was a warm sun again; although the branches and leaves on the lake are fading, it is still quite verdant and lush when viewed from the lakefront. It is already mid-winter, and West Lake does not show any signs of withering. Only in the Hangzhou newspapers, articles in the columns compete to describe the desolate midwinter. People with a heart are worried about next year's rice harvest due to the warm weather, and also worried about how so many poor and helpless people will survive if the weather suddenly turns cold.</p>
<p>Overnight, the sharp northwest wind blew the French parasol trees on both sides of Xinshi Market Road bald; the lakefront, Su Causeway, and Bai Causeway were covered with fallen branches and leaves. Although the sanitation workers swept them away, they would soon be scattered on the road again in the blink of an eye. Looking into the lake, the verdant and lush trees have become withered and yellow.</p>
<p>When Winter Comes, the Boats are Idle</p>
<p>In this harsh winter, the boats in the lake have their cloth awnings removed and lie lazily on the lake. The boatmen have nothing to do, waiting for the severe cold to pass, so that they can be active again in the coming spring. There are more than eight hundred of them in total, with more than five hundred boats. Including their families, about four thousand people live by rowing boats. Many boatmen rent boats from others to row, and split the boat fare with the boat owners at a rate of four to six. The city government stipulates that it costs two thousand yuan for an hour of rowing, but in the winter when the northwest wind howls, even if the boat fare is reduced to two hundred yuan an hour, I am afraid no one will be interested. Their whole family depends on the savings from the income of the spring, summer, and autumn seasons to get through this harsh winter. Some people who have no savings can only resort to borrowing from usurers. Of these many idle people, not counting the old and young, there are many, many young and strong people. How can we prevent them from wasting their useful time?</p>
<p>Winter Relief Shouts Resound Through the Sky</p>
<p>Here, the shouts for winter relief resound through the sky, but on the sidewalks along the bustling lakefront, many people rely on a reed mat and some tattered cotton wool to huddle under the eaves at night. Some of these people seem to be in their sixties, and some seem to be of the age to receive national education. The Zhejiang Daily reported that an old man and two young children starved to death near Henghe Bridge because they had no food. Such situations must be happening all the time.</p>
<p>Children's Shelters are Not Yet Full</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan and the Zhejiang Provincial Relief Institute jointly operate a shelter for orphaned children. Posters of a letter to orphaned children, thousands of words long, are posted everywhere. It is said that since its establishment on November 1, it has successively taken in 123 children, which is still less than the original quota of 200. However, there are still many children on the streets in tattered clothes. This evokes a terrible memory for me, which is that during the war, Guiyang also had a shelter for homeless children, but after being taken in, he stole his clothes and bedding and ran outside, sold them for money, and still roamed the streets. The environment has already educated him in the life of wandering. He is no longer accustomed to norms and is incorrigible by nature. This is of course the responsibility of the social environment, but those in charge of the children's shelter must take this as a warning.</p>
<p>Low-Priced Canteens are Deserted</p>
<p>Another relief institution is the low-priced canteen jointly operated by the Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan and the Hangzhou District of the Youth League. This canteen has been operating for three months. Each customer pays two hundred yuan and can get a cup of milk, a bowl of beef, three steamed buns, and a bowl of soup. Business was booming in the first month, with people shoulder to shoulder. In the last ten days of the second month, the beef ran out and was replaced with spinach and bean vermicelli, and the number of diners gradually decreased. In the third month, it was already deserted. Is it not cheap enough? Is it too far from the slums? Is it because there is no beef? Is the flour for the steamed buns not good? Is the milk too weak? Are the Chinese not used to it? These all seem to be worth the careful study of the organizers. Otherwise, there is a low-priced canteen, but the meaning of relief is not completely fulfilled!</p>
<p>Practical Relief and Serious Investigation</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Branch's winter relief plan includes distributing 2,000 packages of old clothes and making 20,000 cotton-padded clothes for distribution. Zhejiang Province has also established a winter relief committee to solicit donations of cotton-padded clothes, bedding, rice, grains, and miscellaneous grains to distribute to helpless poor people. Of course, such righteous deeds are worthy of praise, but how to distribute the relief to the truly poor people is a current problem. In our country, which does not pay attention to statistics, the exact number of the population is still under investigation. How many poor people are there in Hangzhou? How much rice, grain, cotton-padded clothes, and cotton-padded quilts are needed to be just right? Not to waste? Not to have too little porridge for too many monks? I think this is the time to investigate, but the investigation must be fast, and the relief must also be fast. The relief undertaking is originally different from handling official business in the yamen. But to distribute relief haphazardly in order to be quick would defeat the purpose of true relief. I advocate that an investigation must be conducted beforehand, so that it can be used as a basis for future relief undertakings. Moreover, after the investigation, when the investigation is conducted again at this time next year, the progress and shortcomings of the relief undertaking can be measured.</p>
<p>Useful Years Cannot be Used In recent months, there are fewer girls standing on the side of the road on the lakefront and in the downtown area to sell smiles. There are two explanations in the Hangzhou newspapers. One says that the weather is gradually getting colder, and they cannot bear the cold wind coming from the lake, so they have gradually disappeared; the other says that the municipal police station has driven them away, and they are now going to Gongchen Bridge to prosper the market. According to the facts, the latter statement seems more accurate. Most of these poor girls are selling their flesh out of desperation. Among them, the oldest looks like forty years old, and the youngest is a girl of thirteen or fourteen who has not yet fully developed. From the point of view of education, they should all be useful years. The municipal police station has driven them away from the city, but they are still doing things that they do not care about because they cannot use their useful years. Then, although there are no traces of them in the city for the time being, are they still smiling and selling themselves in other places? In this harsh winter, they stand in the sharp north wind, and if they do not receive a guest, they will go back to be beaten. If they receive a guest, it is only enough for their own food and clothing. These people should have been relieved. Then, in the voice of winter relief, why has no one planned to truly contribute the abilities of these female compatriots with useful years?</p>
<p>Fortune Tellers at the End of Their Road on Chenghuang Mountain Chenghuang Mountain is one of the famous scenic spots in Hangzhou. These days, the fortune tellers on the mountain have also closed their doors to celebrate the New Year. Relying on their own intelligence and some education they have received, they do fortune-telling and fortune-telling because they have no other choice. On the mountain, they rely on the patronage of tourists in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons to save some money to get through this severe winter. After the victory, due to the widespread unemployment phenomenon in the country, the number of fortune tellers on the mountain has increased a lot. Due to the increase in fortune tellers, they cannot earn much money either. This winter will also be quite hesitant. Among these fortune tellers, there are indeed old people, but young people also account for a large number. How to prevent this large number of young people from wasting their years in "idle chatter" is also worth considering by the government and the relief authorities!</p>
<p>Winter is here, and there are fewer tourists at West Lake, unless it is a snowy day, and people with special enthusiasm come to see West Lake in its plain attire.</p>

<p>(1) To Be an Entrepreneur, Not a Capitalist: Ford said, "I am an entrepreneur, not a capitalist." Although I possess incalculable wealth, I do not wish to possess it privately or hide it away. I am merely a legal guardian of these assets. If there were a reasonable trustee committee, I would immediately be willing to hand over these assets. My wealth is entirely put to active use within the factory, to produce goods and support workers. Any surplus is used to expand the business. In short, my outlook on life is to benefit mankind, to ensure that everyone has work and everyone has food to eat."</p>
<p>(2) Replacing Charity with Employment: In society, many sacrifice the happiness of millions, amass vast fortunes, and then use one ten-thousandth of their wealth to purchase the facade of a philanthropist. Ford is different. He does not want to be a hypocritical philanthropist. His motto is "Replace charity with employment." He believes that receiving aid harms a person's dignity. The world generally believes that cripples, such as those with clubfeet, should be given aid, but Ford can provide them with simple jobs. Because a blind person still has functional limbs, and a person with a clubfoot can still work while seated. Therefore, his factory has many disabled workers. His outlook on life is that they are still human and it is not enough to provide them with a little relief. They should be given appropriate work so they can support themselves and live a stable life. That is the highest expression of human compassion.</p>
<p>(II) Internal Characteristics of the Ford Motor Company</p>
<p>(1) The Eight-Hour Work System: Generally, capitalists treat labor as a commodity. They believe that wages are the price of labor, like using money to buy goods. Therefore, they strive for minimal expenditure and maximum labor, extending a person's working hours to twelve or thirteen hours, believing they have struck a great bargain. However, they have not considered the adverse consequences of excessively long working hours on the factory itself. A person's energy is naturally limited, and there should be activities outside of working hours, such as washing clothes, bathing, and obtaining mental nourishment. Only then can one recover from work fatigue and find joy in family life. If one works dozens of hours a day, the monotony of personal life is needless to say, and various malpractices will inevitably arise in the work methods due to insufficient energy. Shoddy work is to be expected. Therefore, excessively long working hours are greatly detrimental to the factory itself. One cannot help but admire Ford's foresight in voluntarily implementing the unprecedented three-eight system.</p>
<p>(2) Wage Increase: Ford pays his factory workers wages that cover the minimum living expenses for the entire family. When Ford suddenly increased these wages to this standard, they were nearly twice as high as those of other manufacturers. Tens of thousands of workers wanted to work at the Ford factory. Ford believed that to ensure a worker's peace of mind, he must be provided with sufficient living expenses to support his entire family. Otherwise, working while worrying about household expenses would directly affect work efficiency and product quality, and would also affect the factory's future prosperity. Ford was aware of this, so he had to first stabilize the workers' lives, enabling them to work with peace of mind, doing their best and fastest work, and viewing the factory as their own home.</p>
<p>(3) Scientific Management: When Ford implemented the eight-hour work system and increased wages, other capitalists secretly laughed at him. They believed that shortening working hours and increasing wages would undoubtedly increase costs. They ridiculed Ford, believing that his factory would turn into a bubble within three months. But the facts proved them wrong. After implementing these measures, Ford made even more money. Ford had a method. Because Ford thoroughly implemented scientific management, although working hours were only eight hours, workers were fully focused on their work during those eight hours. Therefore, the efficiency of eight hours of work surpassed that of twelve hours of work in other factories. Moreover, his factory used a division of labor and cooperation system, where each worker only needed to specialize in one type of part. Because the work was simple, it was especially easy to become proficient. One person's work in a day could easily equal two days' work in other factories. Therefore, although wages were high and hours were short, work efficiency far exceeded that of other factories. As a result, costs were actually lower than those of other factories. To those unfamiliar with the details, it seemed like a great miracle.</p>
<p>(III) External Characteristics of the Ford Motor Company</p>
<p>(1) Returning Profits When Excess Earned: One year, the Ford factory earned more than the deserved profit. Therefore, Ford proposed at the shareholders' meeting to distribute the excess profit proportionally based on the number of vehicles sold, returning it to each Ford car customer. This proposal was, of course, met with extreme opposition from other shareholders. Since the beginning of commerce, there has been infighting and a pursuit of profit above all else. The more profit, the better. There is no reason to return money that has already been earned to customers. Ford thought differently. He believed that the purpose of life is service. Factory owners should make the best products possible, but they should not extract illegal exorbitant profits. If everyone greatly increased profits, on the one hand, it would directly affect customers' purchasing power, and on the other hand, it could be said to contain deceptive behavior towards customers. For these reasons, Ford resolutely returned these illegal profits to customers. Although he broke up with a few profit-seeking shareholders over this matter, it planted an indelible positive image in the minds of many customers. They all believed that Ford was truly a loyal servant of society. As a result, business became even more prosperous. His motto was "Small profits, high volume."</p>
<p>(2) Facing the Approaching Storm: After the First World War, the United States also experienced an economic panic. The market was sluggish, and there was a general atmosphere of economic recession in industry and commerce. In particular, the Ford factory was heavily in debt. Newspapers published forecasts that the Ford factory would go bankrupt. Bankers wanted to lend money to Ford to obtain high interest rates. This act of bankers willingly lending money to Ford would probably have been eagerly sought by others. But Ford had his own far-sighted views. He believed that if he borrowed these high-interest loans from bankers, these interest rates would undoubtedly be added to the costs. If costs were high, the selling price would inevitably increase. If the selling price was high, the volume of consumption would decrease. Continuing this cycle would simply be a dead end. Therefore, he resolutely rejected the bankers' offer to lend him money. Thus, Ford used his great courage. The first step was to sell off the company's inventory at factory prices. In doing so, he cleared most of the debts, and the cash flow became more flexible. The second step was to transfer most of the people from the administrative department to the factory to participate in direct production work. In this way, Ford overcame this difficulty. Some estimated that if Ford had borrowed debt from a bank during the economic storm, it would have created a tragic situation of high car prices and poor sales, and he might have gone bankrupt long ago. This shows that Ford's foresight is very admirable.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief overview of the Ford factory. Among the industrialists in our country, only Rong Desheng, the cotton yarn magnate who was recently kidnapped and escaped danger, is somewhat comparable to Ford. Ford's characteristics are actually what all industrialists should emulate.</p>

<h3>An Introduction to Business Administration</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Employee Training and Job Security</p>
<p>Regarding the hiring of employees, psychology can be used as a basis for implementing testing, which has already been discussed. Now we want to discuss other issues regarding the hiring of employees:</p>
<p>(I) Training of Female Workers</p>
<p>We have talked about the strengths and weaknesses of female workers, as well as the criteria for deciding whether to hire male or female workers. Now we will discuss the training of female workers. Ordinary male workers, because they have already worked as workers, or in fact cannot do other mental work, only do physical work, so their understanding of the factory is deeper than that of female workers. Therefore, the training required by female workers is often more than that of male workers.</p>
<p>During the First World War, various factories established affiliated schools. These schools were the necessary path before entering the factory. Regardless of male or female workers, before formally joining the factory, they must first undergo training in that school, and only when the time is right can they be formally employed. This type of school is often in a separate location in the factory, equipped with the same machines used in manufacturing, so that future workers can learn there, instructed by specialized technicians and full-time professors. The implementation of this work has the following benefits:</p>
<p>1.  Female workers often feel overwhelmed and very timid when they first join the factory because of the change in environment. This situation is very inappropriate for the progress of manufacturing work. After training, they can remove this mentality.</p>
<p>2.  Making bad goods in the manufacturing plant is a loss. Roughly, bad goods are made? On the one hand, it is due to negligence, and on the other hand, it is because of lack of training. Therefore, after training, future losses can be reduced. Therefore, it is worthwhile to do some training work before hiring.</p>
<p>3.  Making a product requires several steps, and each step must cooperate with each other. If this point is trained, the working level of workers can meet a certain standard, and the problem of cooperation between each other can also be solved.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company used to have a school in the Fujian Road branch, specializing in training professional talents in the field of telephone. Participants must take an examination before entering the school. After training for a considerable period in the school and deemed qualified, they will be sent to the company to serve. For general manufacturing plants that produce specialized goods and are of considerable scale, this type of training is very beneficial.</p>
<h3>Colors Used in Factories</h3>
<p>— Lin Hanming</p>
<p>There has been a lot of recent development in the academic theory of colors used in industry. We want to make a simple explanation of this. It is best to first talk about some basic issues of industrial color usage. The colors in the sunlight spectrum are familiar to everyone. It slowly changes from deep purple, one wavelength at a time, to deep red. However, industrial primary colors rarely use pure colors in the spectrum, usually using warm or light grays with many different appearances and effects. Single colors are rarely used except when emphasizing or requiring attention.</p>
<p>It is better to say that color is a feeling than to say it is a property of matter. The same color feeling may be completely different under different conditions. For example, there is a big difference between a blue piece of paper lined with a black background and a green background. Similarly, color can also affect the feeling of other properties. The most obvious is the concept of size. A white circle seems to be larger than a black circle of the same diameter, and the size of a gray circle seems to be between the two. Some colors can make an object appear first, and other colors can hide an object in a dark place. Still other colors can produce a warm effect, such as yellow, peach, and red; other colors, such as blue, green, and outdoor colors, produce a cold effect.</p>
<p>In addition, there are psychological factors. For example, red is the most famous and powerful color in the spectrum. It is combined with strength and movement and has a great influence on human nature. Yellow is brilliant and pleasant, and green is cold and has a spirit-rejuvenating power, but it is neither exciting nor depressing. It may even be the most popular of all colors.</p>
<p>The most important thing in using colors in industry is the selection of machine colors. The scope of this selection is very wide, and it is not limited to a single color. The color of the machine must have a sufficiently high reflectivity, so that the brightness of the environment is roughly the same as the brightness under work at any time. The surface of the machine should be semi-frosted, so as to minimize the intensity of strong light and glare in practical application.</p>
<p>In some jobs, it is very convenient to make the tool appear semi-black against a bright background. Semi-black can also be effectively used as a reflective background to adjust the brightness of the environment during work. Reflective surfaces that evenly reflect light on cursors and work lines should also be painted in semi-black.</p>
<p>The accent colors are a small part of the pure colors and are suitable for machine coloring. The purpose of using it is usually two, one is to indicate dangerous places, action levers, and buttons. The second is to add beauty to a bright place and serve as a decorative function.</p>
<p>The color of the factory building</p>
<p>In large factory buildings, it is rare to use only one color; sudden changes in the color of adjacent factory buildings are also often avoided, and related colors are used instead. It has been proven by experience that there are three main steps to achieving first-class color work in a factory: First, the equipment must be arranged in order, mixed things must be moved away, and placed in another separate room as much as possible. Anything that easily causes chaos in the factory must be carefully placed properly. Second, provide adequate lighting. If the inside of a factory cannot be arranged correctly, it is impossible to achieve beauty, and if the light is not appropriate, it is impossible to make the factory an efficient and talkative factory. Brushing with appropriate colors is very important for good lighting (but few brushings can overcome the obstacles generated by dazzling lights directly in the worker's environment). Third, is to choose the appropriate color, which is based on the principles described above.</p>
<p>In short, in the industrial field, the concept of planning to brush with appropriate colors is not a recent discovery; due to its many benefits, it is believed that its application will be more extensive in the near future.</p>

<h3>Remembering Mr. Dafu</h3>
<p>— Yecao</p>
<p>In the late autumn of the 24th year [likely of the Republic of China, corresponding to 1935], I and several friends agreed to travel to West Lake. We stayed in Hangzhou for half a month, enjoying the scenery, drinking, and chatting. During those half a month, I met Mr. Dafu three times, both before and after. Unexpectedly, these few meetings were the last. Ten years have passed easily, and Mr. Dafu's voice, appearance, and smile still remain in my mind, but he has already sacrificed his life overseas, which is truly heartbreaking!</p>
<p>One morning, we found the poet Mr. Wang Yixin. Yixin was my old classmate. That day, in a lakeside restaurant, he ordered many dishes, and also ate drunken crabs and drank Daran Huadiao wine. In the afternoon, Yixin did not go to work, and I did not participate in the lake tour. In the evening, I went to see Mr. Dafu with Yixin. He invited us to dinner and drank a lot of good wine again.</p>
<p>During the meal, Mrs. Yu [Dafu], Ms. Wang Yingxia, told us that they moved to Hangzhou mainly for the convenience of the children's schooling. Moreover, the air by the lake is good, and the cost of living is low, which is suitable for Mr. Dafu's writing and health.</p>
<p>"If you want to drink good wine," Mr. Yu said calmly, "you can come to my house often. Friends sent me nothing but good wine, enough to drink for a while. Also, let me tell you, if you go to Shaoxing, unless you go to the house of someone who likes to drink, it is difficult to find good wine on the market."</p>
<p>Mr. Dafu had a considerable alcohol capacity and was especially fond of drinking. He drank and talked without showing any fatigue.</p>
<p>"Dafu's health has not been good in the past few years," Ms. Wang Yingxia interjected, "I have repeatedly advised him to eat less; now, the amount he eats is relatively small, and the amount of wine he drinks each time is gradually decreasing."</p>
<p>Mr. Yu smiled without saying a word.</p>
<p>We continued to talk. Mr. Yu was a very eloquent speaker; he had unique insights on creative techniques and several better literary works in our country after the May Fourth Movement. He turned his face and smiled at me and said:</p>
<p>"Yixin is a poet with the strongest artistic temperament, he loves wine, he loves the moon, and he loves West Lake; if one day wine is banned, or if someone does not allow him to eat it at all, then I think his source of poetry may dry up!"</p>
<p>From Mr. Yu, I learned that Yixin likes to drink alone very much. Every night when the moon is white and the wind is clear, he buys a boat to buy wine, and drinks happily alone in the heart of the lake, and then good poems are created.</p>
<p>After dinner, we talked about some trivial matters. Yixin asked him to criticize my articles. Mr. Yu humbly said:</p>
<p>"People in good health have more courage; they can write longer works. ..."</p>
<p>His sincere attitude and enthusiastic tone are still deeply imprinted in my mind.</p>
<p>On the third day, an organization held a reception for a certain cultural group that came to Hangzhou in the auditorium called "Minghu Ying" (?) on the lakeside. We were also invited to participate and sat with Mr. Dafu. In that hall, there was a couplet of tiger skin mats written by Mr. Yu himself, which was very outstanding in the middle, and the text cannot be remembered now.</p>
<p>At that time, the government was stepping up the promotion of the New Life Movement, and no one smoked in the hall. However, Mr. Yu took out a pack of Kretek cigarettes from his long gown pocket and handed one to me. I took it and smiled at him. He knowingly said:</p>
<p>"Just smoke, it doesn't matter ..."</p>
<p>We were the only two people smoking in the entire place. Those who were being entertained looked at us, making people feel a little embarrassed, but Mr. Dafu's expression was exceptionally relaxed.</p>
<p>Later, Yixin told me that Mr. Dafu lived in Hangzhou as a celebrity and gained a lot of convenience and preferential treatment.</p>
<p>The day before we left Hangzhou, we went to his house to say goodbye, but he happened to be out socializing. When we left that day, we unintentionally saw Mr. Dafu and his wife at Hangzhou Station. He said he was sending his wife to the train to Shanghai to collect royalties for him. He himself may come to Shanghai to play soon, and everyone can meet.</p>
<p>The following year, he wrote a lot of travel notes, almost every one of which was a masterpiece. It is said that he had traveled for a period of time on the highway in the border area of Zhejiang, Anhui and Jiangxi provinces.</p>
<p>Some time later, I heard that he went to the Fujian Provincial Government and took up the nominal position of a counselor. Until the August 13th Incident occurred, we did not exchange a single letter.</p>
<p>In the 30th year [likely of the Republic of China, corresponding to 1941], I received a letter from a friend, which briefly mentioned his family changes. I didn't believe it much at the time and thought it must be a rumor.</p>
<p>In Xi'an, in the spring of the 32nd year [likely of the Republic of China, corresponding to 1943], Mr. Xie Bingying and I co-edited a publication, and asked several friends to solicit manuscripts from him. The friends replied that they had lost contact long ago and did not know his location! After the victory, we returned to Shanghai and inquired in many ways, only to learn that Mr. Yu had indeed been killed overseas.</p>
<p>Mr. Dafu's encounter with family changes in his later years was unfortunate enough; he himself then died tragically, can the grief and mourning of all who love him be described in words!</p>
<h3>Literary Trends in a World in Turmoil</h3>
<p>— Hualin</p>
<p>What is presented to us now is not family ideology, partisan concepts, or even national issues or ethnic relations. Without a doubt, it is the entire world issue! The development of science and industry has shrunk the world to the point of being significant. Not only electricity! The speed of transportation and the convenience of airplane travel, even in terms of the atomic bomb, have destroyed the boundaries of countries without residue!</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw and Albert Einstein both felt that if there were another war in the world, culture would be destroyed! Because on this small earth, if the atomic power in the universe is used to destroy it, the entire world can be destroyed immediately! Therefore, the world has reached today, and there is no need to distinguish any boundaries, nor is there any need to be self-centered. Those countries that leave the interests of the human masses, hold the ambition to rule the world, and want to trample on other nations are really foolish and pitiful.</p>
<p>What is urgently needed now is that the world unite as one and not waste human talent on destroying the world. On the one hand, the old and ancient old society cannot be allowed to continue to exist, and on the other hand, everyone must have good food to eat, and everyone is responsible for transforming the world. No one can survive outside the world!</p>
<p>Harming others is harming yourself, needless to say. People and I cannot be separated, just like the cells in the body. If one part is rotten, it affects the safety of the whole. It is not an ideological problem now, nor is it a philosophical problem, but a matter of fact. It is like family brothers disagreeing and arguing endlessly over the father's inheritance. When they are angry, they take a big bomb and explode, intending to destroy others, but they do not know that they will die together.</p>
<p>Therefore, we want to call for help, and literary friends all have foresight, and their feelings are more sensitive than others. It is even more impossible to establish their own schools and despise each other. If everyone has universal love in their hearts, then their tolerance can accommodate the vast sea. Everyone is better than me, this is a happy thing, everyone is not as good as me, and I must be more responsible. The entire world requires the support of everyone! Literary artists are saving humanity from its unfortunate fate. What is before our eyes is the whole world problem! We are in the same boat in the storm, in a precarious situation. If the world does not unite on the basis of human morality and justice, it will soon be destroyed by atomic bombs or more advanced weapons. At that time, famous mountains will not be able to treasure masterpieces, and Buddhist caves will not be able to leave their fragrance for thousands of years!</p>
<h3>Moonlit Prayer</h3>
<p>— Authored by G. Faure of France, Translated by Yan Dachun</p>
<p>The author is a contemporary poet and essayist. He lived in Algeria for many years, deeply immersed in Arab tribes. He has written many novels, mostly depicting the customs and character of Africans, and the local scenery. —Translator's Note</p>
<p>The sky was exceptionally clear, a sheet of blue. In the radiant distance, each day, the sun, in its endless rotation, cast its brilliance upon the parched wheat. The sunlight was intensely hot, practically an unquenchable fire. Not a single dewdrop touched the ground; in the arid breast, the seeds received not a single drop of the moisture they needed for life. The majestic sky had been clear for another week; its immaculate color presaged hunger and suffering, threatening to dissolve this Mohammedan people, as an Atlas vulture swoops down on a rotting corpse.</p>
<p>Could it be that the deity of these believers would allow his beloved children to perish? Would he allow adults and children, bloodless and timid people, to beg for a loaf of bread at the gates of the Romans, so they could eke out another day?</p>
<p>Prayer was needed!</p>
<p>In the murmuring night, myriads of stars were scattered across the sky, like a handful of golden lilies, a slender crescent moon suddenly appearing against the vast black backdrop. The new moon cast a milky radiance, not harsh to the eye. Its light gently enveloped the sleeping fields, and painted long shadows at the feet of all things, slowly moving, like the steel hands on a clock face.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the silence was shattered; a commotion arose from the village. It was the black people, dressed in white, lined up in rows, walking and dancing awkwardly, sending monotonous, guttural pleas to the warm and hazy breeze. Their steps were slow, moving to the passionate rhythm of dull copper drums and clear clappers. The crowd gathered behind them, echoing the last line of the plaintive music with voices of distress. In front of the houses, women wore holiday clothes, intermittently drowning out the songs and merriment passing by with their piercing voices. Children followed along the sides of the procession, young girls wearing gold or copper caps, with wide belts bound with silk and silver threads, wearing bright and pleasing gauze skirts, searching for beloved youths in this sorrowful tide of people.</p>
<p>These excited black people kept moving forward, constantly hopping slightly, their dirge becoming increasingly hoarse. They advanced, the eyes of the villagers fixed on the silver sickle of the moon, as if drawn by an invisible force. At that time, the moon moved lightly, majestically rising among the shimmering, magnificent stars. On the thin and wrinkled heads of the black people, sweat, like bitter tears, poured onto their sunken temples, and their thick hair was also wet. A bestial maw folded back huge lips, revealing ivory-colored tusks. They stared transfixed. They stopped from time to time, forming circles, and the dance began to become more fervent and rapid. The singing became doubly rough, extremely hoarse. The tones of the copper drums and clappers exploded terribly, dominating this hellish music. The piercing cries of the women flashed through the clear night.</p>
<p>In the dimly lit huts, the half-naked old women knelt before roaring charcoal fires, concocting herbal remedies and burning incense, the air filled with the fragrant mist of resin and nard. They were gaunt, bowed over the sacred fire, chanting incantations in trembling, shrill voices. Beneath their slender fingers, they stirred spikenard and galbanum, rose and sandalwood. From time to time, they straightened their busts, worn out by age and prolonged fatigue, stretching their arms, clenching their fists, tilting their heads back, their hair disheveled, in a state of ecstasy, with their limbs extended, they cried out several devilish curses.</p>
<p>The night ignored the ardent prayers, flowing on solemnly and grandly. Now, the moon was descending into the abyss, to rise again from there tomorrow night. Its horns touched the mountains monopolizing the horizon. A minute later, the desolate sky gradually pressed down a black cloth embroidered with silver towards the ground, as if covering a memorial platform.</p>
<p>The singing of the black people no longer sounded like singing; they wailed, shouted, and gasped. The withered long arms only clumsily struck the drums, hitting them quickly and unnaturally. Their wrinkled faces showed extreme agitation, their eyes gleaming, like the eyes of wild beasts. They stamped their feet forcefully, sustained by an excessive faith and devotion to the deity. All their ability, all their desires, their entire soul, their entire flesh, were completely devoted to a superhuman prayer.</p>
<p>Suddenly, just as the moon disappeared over the hillside, a great wind arose in the plain, wailing and shivering. At the same time, large patches of black clouds covered the sky. As the thick clouds slowly pushed forward, the stars gradually went out. The night grew darker and darker. The songs of the men, the cries of the women, the thunderous copper drums grew louder and louder. In those huts, the hunched old women straightened their fleshless, naked bodies, stroking their ugly skin, folding up their loose, already flattened long corsets. In the past, when they were young and happy, in the days when they imitated dignity and their lives were rich, they had thrown handful after handful of mysterious spices onto the blazing charcoal fire. But now, they could only recite incantations in their lost dreams.</p>
<p>Warm, shower-like raindrops fell on the parched earth, lightning flashing, illuminating the distant horizon, thunder roaring majestically from afar. The storm arose magnificently and astonishingly. At this time, the entire crowd felt a sense of happiness and gratitude, and they knelt down tremblingly, their foreheads touching the damp ground, thanking the deity for not despising their prayers.</p>
<p>"Only Yella is God, Mohammed Yu is our Yella!"</p>
<h3>The Flute Player</h3>
<p>— Su Honglie</p>
<p>I don't know from what day, following the footsteps of the lonely dusk, the flute player once again held his beloved small flute, and mournfully played that sorrowful and plaintive flute sound.</p>
<p>I pushed open the window and looked down, at those deep eyes, the pale face, he eternally silently gazed into the distance, as if lost in thought, lonely wandering on this starry and moonlit night.</p>
<p>He, I don't know in what year, from what method, was sent to this strange place.</p>
<p>He never received a bit of human warmth, only borrowing this dim moonlight, using those thin and pale fingers, lightly pressing out a sorrowful and plaintive tune.</p>
<p>He, every night relying on the crumbling wall, perhaps he wants to recapture the old dreams of the past? However, what the facts tell him, is what kind of miserable memory—human feelings are as thin as paper.</p>
<p>So the flute player began to sob quietly again, under that withered long hair, on the pale face, overflowing with tide-like tears, he gradually made me tremble from staring.</p>
<p>Pale frost, completely filled his hair. Cold wind, violently pounced on his thin clothes.</p>
<p>Gradually, he began to tremble, he curled up his body, accompanying him was no longer the sorrowful and plaintive flute sound, but gradually began to sob.</p>
<h3>Written Before Mao Aili's Solo Recital</h3>
<p>— Danshui</p>
<p>The year before last winter, after Ms. Mao Aili held a concert in Shanghai, she planned to go to the mainland. Before she left, at that farewell party, she gave each of us friends a small booklet of the music program, with her name signed above and below, a portrait, and the lyrics. When I got it, I joked with her, "It's really a good gift, with one volume in hand, her 'voice and appearance are as if right here'." She smiled, without getting angry, but sent a "white eye."</p>
<p>Since she went to Chongqing, everyone has not exchanged a single letter, but I am a bit concerned about her recent situation and singing voice; later, from the newspaper, I learned that she had held several concerts in Chengdu, Kunming, and Chongqing, which were very popular; a friend told me that she was also in the Department of Music at Chongqing National Music Academy, and was teaching vocal music, and the Yanjing University Department of Music specially gave her a diploma (a bit of honorary meaning, because she only studied for three and a half years of the major credits.)</p>
<p>Although Aili has been away from this place for a full two years, in our memory, her singing voice, especially the Chinese songs she sang, was so full of rich emotions, her plaintive eyes, hovered in front of us, making us feel an eternal melancholy... Two years later, although she is slightly thinner, although she did not sing a single word for us, although she used a smile to replace all words, she is so often silent, but unwilling to make a permanent silence on life... Recently, after holding this farewell solo concert, she will go abroad for further study. In addition to earnestly expressing our ardent hopes, we hope that in her singing after a long absence, our hearts will, along with her lingering sound, once again enter a dreamlike state, a quiet stream in the jungle, a clear and beautiful high sky... There, she will give us infinite lingering charm.</p>
<h3>Alone in a Small Boat (Photography)</h3>

<h3>Anecdotes from the Literary World</h3>
<p>— Zhan Weng</p>
<p>Kuang Refeng</p>
<p>Mr. Kuang Refeng, a man of letters and elegant demeanor, was widely talked about. In his later years, he lived in Suzhou and still had a penchant for singing and selecting beauties. One day, Wu Quan'an hosted him at a hotel in the city and summoned a prostitute whose appearance was not particularly outstanding. However, Kuang was astonished and thought her to be a celestial being, and composed a poem with Quan'an to give as a gift. Some of the guests laughed at him, but Refeng said, "This sister is pure amidst the impure, which cannot be understood by vulgar eyes."</p>
<p>Refeng adored Mei Lanfang and attended to him meticulously. He once went to the backstage to watch Lanfang put on makeup, gazing intently and admiringly. Afterwards, he told people, "The one who does the makeup for Mei Lang is an unbearable boor, using rough silkworm hands to apply powder and grease, caressing Mei Lang's face twice. Mei Lang allows him to touch and play with him without showing the slightest anger. I didn't expect a boor to enjoy such good fortune, it really makes one feel the sentiment 'I would rather be a boor than envy an immortal!'"</p>
<p>Mr. Liang Rengong once wrote a calligraphy fan for me, which I have cherished for many years and never asked anyone to paint on. I happened to see Mr. Zhu Qiangcun's plum blossom paintings somewhere, and although they were just playful strokes, they seemed rare and precious, so I asked him to paint one. He unexpectedly agreed. A plum blossom branch was painted the next day, simple and charming. However, not a single word was inscribed, only a seal was stamped. Later, I visited Mr. Zhu and asked why he was unwilling to write an inscription. He said, "I have always looked down on Rengong as a person and did not want to match him." Mr. Refeng, upon hearing this, told me, "To pair Rengong's calligraphy with Qiangcun's painting is no different from transmitting Han Fei and Lao Tzu together. You are truly a mischievous person."</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 110</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>That group of people, as if startled, turned around in unison.</p>
<p>"Ah...!" The kimono-clad old man, probably the Inoue that Pingzi spoke of, let out a sound like a sigh and a cheer. "Here...it's here!" His voice was old, and although it was a bit trembling, it was extremely loud.</p>
<p>There was a commotion here at that time; Pingzi, hearing the old man's words, although frowning slightly, could not hide the joy on her face. At the same time, she leaned closer to Hejian, leaning back comfortably, as if waiting for the car to start. The gentleman with the single eyeglass, on the contrary, raised his comfortable body, rested his hands on the back of the front seat, and looked at the group of people, one by one, from the old man to the two attendants. The group of people who came all followed behind the old man and ran towards Pingzi's car.</p>
<p>"Be careful!" The single-eyed gentleman gave a warning to his own people in German.</p>
<p>"It's Shajun again!" The old man leaned his head in from outside the car window, looking at the single-lensed gentleman with a half strange, half funny expression, squinting his eyes, looking like he was smiling and crying at the same time, "I have to trouble you to get out of the car and talk to me for a few words, would you be so kind as to give me this face? ... Oh!" The old man glanced at Pingzi and saw Hejian, "Oh, and there's a handsome young man, of course it's Hejian Yuer!"</p>
<p>The single-eyed gentleman immediately showed an awkward expression, tapping his fingers on the back of the chair three or four times, perhaps it was some kind of secret signal, then he opened the car door and got out of the car; closing the car door with a bang. The old man reached out a hand, stroked the single-lensed gentleman's back, and invited him to walk to the opposite side of the road. At this time, Hejian suddenly felt a soft, moist little hand reaching over, gently stroking the back of his hand, one index finger, constantly tapping, Hejian knew this was a secret telegraph warning—tap tap dit tap—after the warning was tapped, then came the telegram: "Beware of the cigarette case. The road ahead is clear, beware of the cigarette case, the road ahead is clear! ... This is a German secret agent, their sergeant, is Konoe... Prime Minister... Gather your courage! Beware of the cigarette case, it's best to give it to me!"</p>
<p>"Who is the old man?" Hejian gently pulled out the hand receiving the telegram, stroking Pingzi's hand, tapping in the same way, sending a telegram.</p>
<p>"Sorry" Pingzi again followed the original pattern, tapping rhythmically, "I thought you knew them... The old man is a close disciple of the Yuanlao faction, Xigongsi, Inoue Kiyoki Elder, the head of the national Buddhist sect..."</p>
<p>"Understood..." Hejian replied, "He is my 'kendo' ancestor—my master's ancestor, the old man's kendo is invincible, if you know him, I ask you to introduce me, I want to learn a few tricks from him... Is he related to the Black Dragon Society?"</p>
<p>"The Dharma is boundless!..." Pingzi replied, "There is no country he can't enter, let alone the Black Dragon Society!... His disciples and grandchildren are all over the world, ... 'I am unworthy' is the latest disciple he has selected to join his sect, specializing in learning 'Mysticism'..."</p>
<p>"Then, you are my ancestor's generation, I am very disrespectful...! What is 'Mysticism'?"</p>
<p>"You're welcome, you're welcome"; we are equals. I am preparing to worship you as a 'Judo' master, if you think I am qualified: then, we can call it even... In addition, I also want to practice Chinese language from you, learn Chinese poetry... 'Mysticism' and 'Banghe Technique' are largely the same; in India it is the Brahman sect, transmitted to Tibet, evolved into Tantrism, in cultivation, it is the gate to becoming a Buddha, in magic, it is the 'Vajra Powerful Force', which can control all military force, as long as you concentrate, and point with your hand, you can immobilize, you can kill..."</p>

<h3>Street Vendors</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>The conflict between the vendors can be said to be the largest mass brawl that occurred in Shanghai after the victory of the War of Resistance. Without discussing the issue of responsibility for this incident, the authorities should have given careful consideration to the crackdown on vendors beforehand. One cannot rely on a piece of paper to issue an order and arrest those who disobey, in order to crack down on vendors, to enhance appearances, to stop smuggled goods, to eliminate the black market,... To be honest, to achieve the above goals, only cracking down is to abandon the fundamental for the superficial. Moreover, vendors cannot be cracked down on so easily.</p>
<p>Nothing in the world is more serious than hunger. They originally sought profit and did a little business, their purpose was only to make a living. If they had large capital and ways, why would they be standing on the streets in such rainy weather?</p>
<p>We support the crackdown, but we also hope that the authorities will arrange a way out for them when cracking down, that is, to allow them to make a living. Otherwise, it is easy to force them to take risks.</p>
<p>The vendors themselves must also consider for the policymakers. All demands, taking actions outside the track, will not help their own problems, and the consequences will be unimaginable. This is definitely not a smart way. Now, the problem is finally coming to an end. If it is exploited by a third party's conspiracy, it will lose social sympathy.</p>
<h3>Current Affairs Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>— Huiqun</p>
<p>Common Sense About the United Nations Translated from the English "Westminster Gazette"</p>
<p>The most important news from these major countries is the United Nations General Assembly in New York. In addition to the news of the National Assembly, the newspapers are filled with news about the League of Nations General Assembly: what is the limitation of the veto, the amendment of the United Nations Constitution, the five-power conference, which makes people who do not understand international politics have a headache, and they do not understand what the five powers are busy with. If you are one of them, just spend three minutes reading the following article, and you can get a clear and concise idea of the Charter of the United Nations, so that you will not feel a headache when you see this kind of news——</p>
<p>Q: What is the purpose of the United Nations Organization?</p>
<p>A: The charter states that the purpose of the United Nations Organization is "to maintain justice, to respect obligations arising from treaties, to promote social progress, to raise living standards, to implement freedom of thought and belief, to live together in harmony, to unite the strength of the member states to ensure peace, and to prevent new wars."</p>
<p>Q: How can this purpose be achieved? How do the United Nations cooperate?</p>
<p>A: First, representatives from each member state, regardless of whether it is a large country or a small country, participate in the United Nations General Assembly; in the General Assembly, each country has one vote, regardless of size.</p>
<p>Q: Doesn't Russia actually have three votes?</p>
<p>A: The Soviet Union has only one vote, but the Ukrainian Republic and the Belarusian Republic also have one vote each because they have independent foreign ministries and foreign ministers.</p>
<p>Q: Doesn't the British Empire have six votes?</p>
<p>A: The self-governing territories, India, and the United Kingdom (the British mainland) each have one vote, just like in the League of Nations before.</p>
<p>Q: What is the task of the United Nations General Assembly?</p>
<p>A: The United Nations General Assembly discusses various international issues and can make recommendations to all member states.</p>
<p>Q: Can it recommend amendments to existing treaties?</p>
<p>A: No. At the San Francisco Conference, Egypt proposed giving the United Nations General Assembly this power. This motion only received the support of a few countries. Most countries believe that this would add more difficulties to the United Nations General Assembly than it could solve.</p>
<p>Q: What is the "Security Council"?</p>
<p>A: The Security Council is the executive body of the United Nations. Its task is to study, discuss, and resolve disputes between countries by peaceful means. If a country disrupts the peace or carries out aggression, the Security Council will convene member states to take the necessary steps to ensure peace.</p>
<p>Q: Does this mean that the Security Council can order a country to participate in a war?</p>
<p>A: No. Any member state, if it wishes, can conclude a special agreement to hand over all or part of its military force to the Security Council for use. The Security Council can only request member states to sever economic or political relations with the aggressor. Member states do not have the obligation to participate in a war.</p>
<p>Q: What should happen if there is a dispute between two member states?</p>
<p>A: They should resolve it peacefully themselves as much as possible. If it cannot be resolved, either party can bring the dispute to the Security Council; or the Security Council can automatically intervene.</p>
<p>Q: What happens next?</p>
<p>A: The Security Council will first conduct an investigation. After the investigation is clear, it can recommend methods for resolving the dispute; if the issue is a legal one, it can ask the International Court of Justice to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Q: What is the International Court of Justice?</p>
<p>A: The International Court of Justice is composed of many well-known lawyers selected according to specific rules. It has the power of adjudication. The International Court of Justice can accept and judge issues such as doubts about the interpretation of treaties in accordance with international public law.</p>
<p>Q: Does the International Court of Justice also handle political issues?</p>
<p>A: No. The International Court of Justice only handles purely legal issues. Political issues should be resolved by the Security Council itself based on the principles of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p>Q: Should all member states abide by the laws of the Security Council?</p>
<p>A: Yes. All member states "agree to accept and implement the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the Charter."</p>
<p>Q: Then, is it the case that in all cases, all disputes should be resolved peacefully by the countries involved, or resolved by the Council?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Resolving all disputes by peaceful means is an important task of the Security Council. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Rule of Law</h3>
<p>— Zhan Weng</p>
<p>It was reported that the president of the Wuxi Court, while riding in a chartered car through a certain place, did not listen to the traffic police's instructions and even gave the traffic police two slaps. The onlookers all discussed that the president knew the law but violated it. I think that knowing the law will definitely not violate it. Perhaps the traffic police's interference with the president should be punished with two slaps according to law!</p>

<h3>The Organization of Beggars 4</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>"Seizing the Bucket" Wars</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the construction of new alleyways has completely stopped. Some new-style alleyways have even added watchmen and police. In order to maintain cleanliness, beggars are absolutely not allowed to establish "buckets" in the alleyways. Therefore, the number of buckets has only decreased, while the emerging new beggars are thriving. The new beggars often lament that there is no "bucket" to accommodate them, so they have to launch invasion wars. Before launching an offensive, the invaders create incidents out of nothing and make unreasonable demands on the existing bucket beggar gangs. The beggar gangs refuse. Then the invaders deliberately publicize to escalate the situation. The defenders, aware of this, hurriedly gather their followers and send out calls for reinforcements. Once both sides have completed their deployments, a martial drama begins. The outcome will determine the ownership of the "bucket." However, no matter which side wins, the loser will never give up. They reorganize their forces and come back for another fight. From then on, disputes are endless, and bloody tragedies follow one after another. Therefore, generous and honest beggars do not dare to easily start trouble. Moreover, beggar gangs consider accommodating displaced beggars to avoid disputes. This is also a virtuous policy of the beggar gangs to avoid internal strife!</p>
<p>The Technique of Snatching Leftovers</p>
<p>The old brother beggar gangs originally regarded "snatching leftovers" as the only way to solve people's livelihood problems. Since the outbreak of the war, the supply of firewood and rice has been difficult, and food delivery services have closed down one after another, causing great suffering to the people in the beggar gangs. Fortunately, after the victory, everything is gradually returning to normal, and merchants are again offering food delivery services, so the old brothers can restore their previous enjoyment. In the inland areas, beggars can beg for leftover food from residents. But in Shanghai, every household hires maids and drivers with large appetites, so no matter how much food the masters have left over, it is all taken care of by these subordinates. Moreover, the old brother beggar gangs have never had the right to beg from residences. Their only method is to stop people on the road to snatch leftovers. Every day, Shanghai shops must provide two meals, each delivered by these carriers. After eating, there is often a lot of leftover rice and cold soup. The beggars wait on the roadside, and when the food carriers pass by, they surround them and force them to stop. They automatically and forcefully seize the opportunity to sweep away the leftover rice and leftovers. After snatching, they must give a portion to the "grandfathers," and the rest is devoured to fill their stomachs. Given the size of Shanghai, the number of people eating catered meals is at least in the hundreds of thousands, and the amount of leftovers every day is enough to sustain the lives of the beggars.</p>
<p>However, snatching leftovers is not a very peaceful job. Whenever beggars stop people on the road, the shop employees will not submit docilely and allow themselves to be robbed. They will take out the carrying poles as weapons and hit the children on the head. At this time, the children are determined to snatch the food and are unwilling to fight, so they adopt a policy of non-resistance and endure the beatings. They express that they can endure hardship, but the food must be snatched. The beggars' reasoning is: "You have already earned enough money from the catering, and these leftover foods do not belong to you. They are left to feed the poor children."</p>
<h3>Do You Have These Bad Habits?</h3>
<p>— Wang Jiande</p>
<p>When "Loyal Heart" was showing at a certain theater, there was a short film with abundant laughter that was added to the show. This film portrayed the many bad and strange habits that could occur in theaters. These habits feel realistic and relevant in many theaters in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The most common thing is that people still refuse to take off the hat that protects their head when the show starts, letting the audience behind them enjoy a patch of darkness. Some gluttons, even when the show starts, refuse to let their mouths rest for a moment. Peanuts, melon seeds, shelling, and the sound of opening paper bags can sometimes create a racket, making the audience see only the protagonist's mouth opening and closing on the screen, and making them confused about what's being said. Some people sitting by the aisle are also very comfortable, stretching out one leg, and some reckless latecomers often trip over it. The warm sofa is still uncomfortable and unsatisfactory for some audience members. Their feet extend into the seats of the people in front of them, tossing and turning. It is embarrassing that people spend several hours trying to find some entertainment, but you interrupt their enjoyment. Maybe some people are born restless! They are often uneasy in their seats, and even in a short one or two hours, they keep switching seats, squeezing in and out, making everyone stand up for you, and sometimes even enjoying the taste of being stepped on. Smoking in theaters has long been prohibited in Shanghai, but that day I saw with my own eyes a spectator with a cigarette in his hand. You see how leisurely he is, but it is in the dark, and the movie is playing.</p>
<p>Pig and Cow</p>
<h3>Fable</h3>
<p>— Ge Ming</p>
<p>The people of Jiangnan huddled up in fur coats in the northwest wind. The cold clouds of the night fell tightly. The voices of the poor people demanding winter relief became more urgent and pitiful.</p>
<p>It is considered a matter of course for the rich to nourish themselves. Whether they are willing to relieve the suffering of the poor or shelter others from the cold is only clear to them. For a poor person like me, I have the will but not the power. I really don't know what to do. So I will tell a new Aesop's fable to offer to the rich.</p>
<p>That is the story of a pig and a cow. On this day, the pig complained to the cow, saying that it was really unpopular and didn't stand out. The pig said, "People always praise your generosity and kindness!" Then the pig went on and on: "That's right, you can be milked, and you can also be made into cheese, but my contribution is really more than yours! I give away meat, not to mention ham. In addition, I also give people bristles, and people also pickle my legs! But people are still not happy with me. A pig is always a pig in the end. What is the reason for this?"</p>
<p>The cow thought for a while at this time and replied: "That may be because I contribute everything I have while I am alive, which is completely different from your style."</p>
<p>After reading the above story, I don't know if you (as a human being) have also thought about it. Many people, while alive, are stingy. Apart from consuming or seizing some of the things that originally existed in the world, they have never produced, increased, contributed, or given anything. With a "wisdom" that may not be above the wisdom of pigs, even before death, they pretend to be generous and passionate. I think their fate is often more destructive than praiseworthy, and more failures than achievements, and they are only exhausted physically and mentally.</p>
<h3>Stop Profiteering: Set Up Ticket Offices</h3>
<p>— Hesong</p>
<p>It has been two weeks since the tram fare increased. The tram company's reason for requesting a fare increase, in addition to "high prices," also included the losses caused by "soldiers riding without tickets." Some people say that as long as the tram conductors don't profiteer and hand over all the ticket money to the company, the company can increase its income. It is a "well-known fact" that conductors profiteer. I hope the tram company can find a way to eliminate this situation. I would like to make a suggestion to the tram company.</p>
<p>Conductors profiteer by not giving change and not giving tickets. These two methods are mostly used when the passengers are crowded, because no one wants to make too much trouble when it is crowded.</p>
<p>It is probably impossible to avoid crowding at present. There are too many people in Shanghai. But the reason why conductors can cheat is entirely because they handle money. The only way to prevent them from handling money is not to sell tickets on the tram. I suggest that ticket offices be set up at major stations to sell tickets all day long. In this way, everyone has enough time to buy tickets, and the conductors will have no way to cheat.</p>
<p>Moreover, if this is done, there only needs to be one manager on each tram, unlike now where one person is in charge of the door and one person sells tickets. The company can save a sum of money. Wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone?</p>
<p>When a ticket seller works in a tram full of people, the frustration of the conductor is conceivable, and the passengers will also feel extremely unpleasant. What's more, this kind of profiteering often happens? For the sake of passengers and for the company itself, I hope the tram company can try "off-tram ticketing"! Before American-made automatic ticket vending machines are used in our country, this may not be a good method.</p>
<p>Understatement</p>
<p>— Fang Wen</p>
<h3>Somewhat Gratifying</h3>
<p>The Chinese people lament that they are backward in everything. Only in the traffic system, from driving on the left to driving on the right, have they finally caught up with modern European and American countries.</p>
<h3>Twelve Provinces</h3>
<p>More than half of the Taiwanese twelve zodiac bandit gang has been captured. The Shanghai scalpers, who profit like tigers, have long been targeted. Recently, wild chickens have been eliminated by drawing lots, and water rats have also been paraded through the streets.</p>
<p>Twelve zodiac signs, Taiwan and Shanghai, share the same fate.</p>
<h3>Adding a Lot of Color</h3>
<p>Banning street vendors and beautifying the city has resulted in beautifying the city with banana peels and chestnut shells all over the street, as well as beggar women lying on the cement along the street, hugging broken cotton and catching lice, adding a lot of color to the city!</p>
<h3>Reversal of Extremes</h3>
<p>Maritime commerce has always followed the formula of "big fish eat small fish, small fish eat shrimp," with department stores overwhelming large stores, large stores overwhelming small businesses, and small businesses overwhelming small stalls.</p>
<p>Now everything has changed. The united markets of vendor concentration camps are cheap and of good quality, and the doors are crowded like a marketplace. Department stores are instead "deserted and lonely." Sixty years of feng shui turns around and cannot escape the law of reversal of extremes.</p>

<h3>Discussing the Draft Constitution: Talking about Dr. Wang Chonghui</h3>
<p>— Chunfu</p>
<p>The National Assembly has been convened in Nanjing for more than ten days. The amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China, which is related to China's century-long plan, will be submitted to the National Assembly for deliberation and approval. The person who organized this draft constitution is Dr. Wang Chonghui, who is mentioned here.</p>
<p>Regarding the content of the new draft constitution, Wang said to our reporter on the 25th of this month: It was drafted based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference and compromises the opinions of all parties. The new system is a new system between the presidential system and the cabinet system. We can probably remember that Wang has always had unique attainments in constitutional law. In the first year of the Republic of China, when the Nanjing Provisional Government was established, Wang served as the first Minister of Foreign Affairs and wrote "A Preliminary Draft of the Constitution of the Republic of China," which attracted the attention of Chinese and foreigners.</p>
<p>Wang is a world-famous jurist and a senior veteran in the diplomatic world. He has served as a judge of the Hague International Court of Justice twice, and has served as Minister of Justice and Foreign Affairs in China.</p>
<p>Wang's courtesy name is Liangju. He is from Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, and is from the same village as Jiang Guangnai. His father, Yuchu, was an old pastor with a strong Taoist spirit, and he was an old friend of Sun Yat-sen, Chen Shaobai, and Qu Fengchi. Wang studied at Queen's College in Hong Kong in his youth. He was intelligent and often debated religious principles with his father, incurring his father's wrath. He fled to Shanghai to work as a teacher at Nanyang Public School. He then graduated from Beiyang University, studied in the United States, and majored in law, earning a doctorate in law from Yale University. Soon after, he obtained the qualifications of a British lawyer in England and practiced law. Wang was the first Chinese to practice law in a foreign country.</p>
<p>Wang also has a connection with the revolution. As early as before the establishment of the Tongmenghui, Wang, in Tokyo, co-organized the "National Newspaper" with Shen Xiangyun, Qin Lishan, and Ji Zhi, advocating nationalism and promoting the revolution. At that time, Wang was responsible for writing the English section. In the thirty-first year of Guangxu, Sun Yat-sen arrived in New York, and Wang was also in Philadelphia, USA, promoting the revolution. Sun Yat-sen wrote to Wang, asking him to meet in New York to discuss the way forward. At that time, he published an important document in the history of the Chinese revolution—a declaration to the outside world.</p>
<p>When the Nanjing Provisional Government was established, Wang served as the first Minister of Foreign Affairs. During the Shao Yi cabinet, he transferred to Minister of Justice. Because he opposed Yuan Shikai's policies, he resigned at the same time as the Kuomintang cabinet members. At that time, Sun Yat-sen established the Railway Corporation in Shanghai and was hired as a consultant. Later, he also served as the Minister of Justice in the Lushi Yi cabinet and the Minister of Education in the Tang Shaoyi cabinet, and once served as the acting Prime Minister, organizing a "good people cabinet."</p>
<p>The Chinese diplomatic community is indeed bound to the surname Wang. Wang Chonghui, Wang Zhengting, and Wang Shijie have all served as Ministers of Foreign Affairs. Wang Chonghui succeeded Zhang Qun as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the 26th year of the Republic of China. At that time, foreign insults were imminent. Wang relied on his touted "three no's"—no pushing, no perfunctory, no fear of difficulty—and achieved considerable success. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Japanese side repeatedly spread rumors and divisions, saying that Wang was "dissatisfied with the party and government" and "determined to leave," and babbled wildly in the pseudo-"Xin Shen Bao."</p>
<p>Wang is good at rhetoric. It is still remembered that before the 21st year of the Republic of China, China was still in a state of division. At the conference convened by the League of Nations, Wang Chonghui represented the Nanjing National Government. At that time, a representative of a certain country asked Wang: "Does the government you represent represent the central government of your country? Or does it represent the southwest government of your country?" This question was undoubtedly a manifestation of the Westerners' contempt for China, but our Dr. Wang leisurely replied to this rude questioner: "What I represent is the government of our country recognized by the world." In the end, just as Wang hoped, we also hope that "the new constitution can satisfy the majority of the people!"</p>
