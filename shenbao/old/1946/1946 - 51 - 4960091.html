<h3>軍事復員會議閉幕　蔣主席勉以確守本份　達成實精速三個要求</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕軍事復員會議，今晨九時舉行閉幕禮，蔣主席親臨致訓。首對各將領能深切了解政府和平統一政策，切實遵守停戰命令，認為値得嘉獎。繼勉各將領，應確守軍入保國衛民本份，對於當前政治外交各事，諭囑毋須過慮。嗣以提高官兵素質，整飭部隊紀律，加强官兵訓練，達成「實在」「精兵」「快速」三個要求為勗，期能貫澈精兵主義，幷使中國軍隊現代化。主席訓話後，旋介請魏德邁將軍演講，至十一時許畢。主席即躬率全體將領，分乘汽車一百二十五輛，駛往紫金山下，謁國父孫中山先生陵後，時為午正十二時，即至靈谷寺無重殿陣亡將士墓，舉行公祭。祭畢，即在陣亡將士紀念塔前曠地，舉行野餐，每人各進內裝三明治麵包，水菓，餐點一包，食後自由遊覽風景區，遊憩片時，諸將領即相繼乘軍返城，此富有歷史性之軍事復員會議，遂圓滿結束。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕今日軍事復負會議，舉行閉會禮時，魏德邁將軍偕柯侖姆將軍，親臨實獻兩點：（一）追述渠初臨中國時如何建議將原有之陸軍三百七十個師，逐步精編，使其縮减充實，如今日終能完成抗戰之大任。（鼓掌）渠認為中國乃一貧窮之國家，絕不能長此担負廠大軍費，蓋富如美國，平時亦祗許擁有十個師至十二個師之兵力也。（鼓掌）次就調整軍官階級，有所譬喩。渠謂：渠本人現雖為三顆星之將軍，（二級上將）但他日回國以後，恢復原有體制，即須除去二顆星，重領其少將頭銜矣。然此均不足齒懷，吾人感謝上帝仁慈，賜予服務機會，吾人能敎育子女，享受最低生活，於願已足。（大鼓掌）（二）官兵關係之必須加强。渠謂：美國軍隊在行軍停止後，軍官必先檢查兵士健康，飲食，營養，宿營地，及一切設備，乃至服裝是否適宜，而後再注意其個人。（大鼓掌）蓋現代戰爭，欲求官兵之犧牲，決心一致，首須加强官兵之關係。最後渠以極肯定之語氣，確信中國軍官，如能遵照主席整編方案實施，中國軍隊必能現代化。中國整軍建國成功，中國將成為一偉大當强繁榮之國家。語極精闢，全場鼓掌達十餘次。</p>

<h3>美前駐蘇天使　臺維斯為蘇辯護　原子彈秘密如不與共享　蘇為自衛有權藉間諜盜取</h3>
<p>〔聯合社哈伐那十八日電〕美國前任駐蘇聯大使台維斯，今日在此單獨向聯合社記者談稱：蘇聯對於原子彈秘密，如被其先前駢肩作戰之盟國斬而不予共享，則爲自衛計，在道義上有權藉軍事間謀盜取之，美英方面深閉固拒政策，就其含義推論，不啻一種敵對行爲，各大國佈置諜報網，刺探別國軍情，原不自今日始。美英不欲使俄人得知原子秘密，殆欲視俄人如童孩耳。實則蘇聯才能優秀之科學家不乏其人，自能於兩年之內在其本國實騐室中研究出原子戰術之方法。爲今之計，吾人茍非於各大　間取得互相信任，彼此合作，則唯有重演强權政府之老把戲，兩者不能兼而有之。蘇聯現須和平以休養生息，美英蘇三國間當前混亂的猜欵應予一掃而空，不此之圖，則唯有相率從事大規模之競爭，趕造兵工廠與科學實騐室，同歸於全面毀滅之大戰而已。蘇聯今日　怕英國帝國主義，正如英國　怕蘇聯對於其東地中海生命綫，油田及印度與中國方面之利益，具有野心。外交棋戲正在鈎心鬥爭，着着不讓，三强此種明爭暗鬥何日可了。</p>

<h3>雅爾達協定公佈後　遠東永久和平　墮入霧中　東九省仍雀巢鳩佔　我勝利之果被竊矣</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十八日電〕雅爾達秘密協定公布後，中國羣情憤激，遠東永久和平之希望因此又墮入重霧。中蘇友好條約承認外蒙古獨立，及同意在東九省予蘇聯以種種經濟權利，中國人亦將視之爲出於英美强迫，俾令蘇聯參與太平洋戰事。中國對於美國之憤恨，因懷有戰後協助進行大規模建設工作之希望，或能消散。但其對於蘇聯態度將如何改變，猶未明瞭。中國對於千島羣島固極少問係，但在中蘇條約中所簽字斷送者，實爲命脈所鑿，外蒙古獨立爲多年來中國所拒絕承認，中國抗日戰事即起因於東九省，意在將日本驅出東北，但因中蘇條約之結果，日本去而蘇聯來，東九省仍雀巢鳩佔，現時瀰漫於中國之情緒，爲蘇聯尚圖獲得條約以外之權利。重慶已有羣衆示威，要求蘇聯退出東九省，中蘇談判內容予以公開，以及蘇聯遵守條的，在中國遊行示威往往起事於無足輕重之人，規模亦小，而時或抓到羣衆心理，迅速蔓延，變爲全國性之運動，不僅使中國投入戰事，速遠隔西太平洋諸國亦不免牽入。第一次大戰後，中國發覺列强問有秘密協定，以膠州灣割予日本，俾拉撤日本以對抗德國，而日本得以使其在東北形勢益形加强。雅爾達協定如出一撤，中國又發覺其勝利之果，一部分爲人竊去矣。</p>

<h3>肅清納粹餘霧　克服民族弱點　重建柏林</h3>
<p>— 本報駐英特派員　徐誠斌寄</p>
<p>在四强軍政督導下的柏林市政府，不久前開了一個慶覽會，報吿半年來工作的成續。在數字上看來，柏林的情况，已逐沂定上正常的軌這。重建柏林的工作，正如艾森豪威爾所說，沒有人知道如何開始。毀滅之澈底，可說是空前的。在倫敦，在重慶，我們於聳立着的房屋方面，間或看得到空襲的遺跡，但在柏林，你首先看到的是一片廢墟，然後在街邊，或能找到一宅屋頂已去而底層尙存的房子。今日居民的棲身之處，便是那些未爲砲火全毀的房子。一張防雨布，幾堆稻草，應付了最念迫的需要。街上的淸靜，正符合死城之名，偶或看見一個老人推了一車木柴回家之外，沒有其他生氣。</p>
<p>但是靠了盟軍的協助，善後救濟總署的接濟，柏林已克服了若千令人難信的困難。生活必需品雖然缺少，並不起恐慌，至少限度，還可以維持生命。除了不斷進城的難民外，住的問題已暫時解次。損失不大的房子，已在修理，若不是材料短少，進行的速度可更滿人意。煤氣與電方已經恢復，不過統制甚嚴，煤料是絕對找不到，大家找木料，燒火取暖。糧食分配，根據工作能力而定，不工作的人沒有份。最近兩月英美蘇法當局已能按照預定計劃分配，並酌量增加最低級分配的質量。春季後的情形，可能再進一步。</p>
<p>社會生活，也漸趨正常。地下火車，公共汽車及電車大部已恢復。學校肅淸了納粹餘零，重定課本，已先後開學。大學的敎職員名單已定，學生入學資格審查完畢後，即可開學。</p>
<p>學習勞動技術　計劃小型生產</p>
<p>在三百萬居民中，一百萬人在市政府指導下工作，遊閒的人數的五十萬人，但是其中大都是老弱之輩，不能工作，所以工作人數與人口總數的百分率算得極高。往日在公司機關中做事的職員，現在都得改行，訓練技術人員，重定職業的範團，成為一時之需，公司機關復興何日，不得而知，最急迫的需要是在根本上重建社會，學習勞工技術，計劃小規模生產。</p>
<p>規定工者得食　逮捕黑市商人</p>
<p>柏林的法令，規定「工者得其食」，可是不工作人仍有。許多人在戰時積了錢，有錢便有東西可買。這些有資本的人大都在黑市中購備食糧和日用品。盟軍當局盡力逮捕黑市商人，不能說沒有成就，但是一個德國，如仿劃分成四區，而四區的法規並不統一，警制又不充滿，所以違法的事就很難免發生。</p>
<p>這是柏林生活的外表。從停戰到今日，從澈底的混亂到今日的秩序，決不是一段容易過的日子。有此成績，端賴盟軍與德國人民的合作。盟軍發命令，供給物資；德國人民執行命令，出力工作。他們的服從心之濃，與做事効率之高，减少了許多困難。他們知道，要改進現在的生活狀况，全靠自己努力。</p>
<p>冬天難關已過　前途荊棘未除</p>
<p>冬夭是一個難關。老少的死亡率已經很高，天寒地凍，生活更成了一個最嚴重的問題。由於預防得法，傳染病雖未曾躉延，但長期的營養不足，疾病却已造成了普通現象。</p>
<p>總之，德國人是在盡他們之所能，從事奮鬥。他們並沒有自憐的感情。他們的特點是賣任感。德國人覺得戰爭的發動者是納粹黨，他們不過是遵守軍令而已，所以不能算是罪人。這是今日德國民族還在表現着的弱點。他們不會看不出他們的根本錯誤，他們正需要再敎育。</p>
<p>自然，他們也還需要日常的生活。餓肚子的人次沒有談民主自由的情緒。（八日）</p>
<h3>領帶不准掉換</h3>
<p>美國有句俗修：「領帶不准掉換。」盟軍在德國處置德戰犯與其軍民正是這樣：對前者處以廳得之罪，對軍民則施以戴格的再敎育，對象不同，處理方法亦隨之而互異，「領帶不能掉換」，此之謂也。</p>

<h3>鹽政改革管見（上）</h3>
<p>— 徐爾信</p>
<p>我國鹽政制度，歷代遞嬗演變，各有其特點，書册所載，備極詳盡，大致可分爲無稅制，徵稅制，與專買制三種。民國成立以來，承襲晚淸之秕政，因循未改，積弊甚深，多數地方，仍爲招商認岸，領運完課，或交商認辦，包繳租課，爲一種商專賣制。但商倒引懸之區，與近場私鹽充斥，官不敵私之地，輒改歸官辦，行之未幾，尋議廢格，或又開放自由，甚或仍歸商辦，因革紛紜，是非貿亂，迄無定制可言。</p>
<p>國府定都南京以來，力圖改制，廿年三月由立法院制定鹽法七章三十九條，採取就塲徵稅制，任人民自由買賣，自不失爲一種完善之鹽制。惟我國土地遼闊，各地情形，複雜特殊，產區遍及全國，海井池岩等鹽，無不俱備。產製方法，或晒或煎，或天然結晶，隨地皆是，零星散漫，異乎其他各國。凡此情形，則塲產之管理，自屬極端困難，在場產管理尙未臻嚴密以前，則是項就場徵稅，自由買賣之制，衡諸我國目前鹽務情形，實行殊多窒碍，茍勉强實行，勢必私鹽充斥，影響稅收甚鉅。其詳細理由，業見於拙著「食鹽專賣　議」一文，（刊登香港「財政評論」第五卷第五號）茲値抗戰勝利，建國工作亟待進行，而整頓稅收，充裕財政，尤爲迫不容緩。爰不揣愚陋，　歷年來對鹽務研究所及，諾抒各見，　備參考，而資共同商討。</p>
<p>就塲徵稅</p>
<p>任人民自由買賣之制，政府目的祇在於徵稅，雖手續簡化易行，但恐非各地情形複雜如我國者所能適用。鹽之爲物，係民食必需，不可一日或缺，且可供農業，工業，醫藥，軍冊之用。其重要性，並不在糧食之下。政府不僅須以財政爲目的，對之徵稅，並應顧及調劑民食，平衡供求，（因盟非如米，麥，有其他食糧可供代用）暨使產額增加，足以供應建國時期各業之需要，而無虞匱乏。過去專商認辦時代，商人唯利是圖，在運輸困難之偏遠地方，每視爲畏途，不願運往，此等地方，時有淡食之恐慌。即有冒險運往者，以風險旣大成本較重，非居奇抬價，不免食貴，即攙雜泥沙，出於食惡。惟以各地銷鹽，向係計口配引，年有定額，政府猶採管理之制，商人不往，則歸官運，以濟民食。一旦採取就場征稅之制，任人民自由買賣，政府不加過問，則僻遠地方，商旣不去，官又不運，鹽非他物可比，無代用物品，日用匱乏，勢必造成嚴重淡食之恐慌。又我國製鹽方法，或以晒，或以煎，手續繁簡優劣不同，或係天然生產，不假人力，成本又有多寡之異。商人唯利是趨，其成本較高之場，所產之鹽，勢將無人問津，成爲有產無銷，鹽民恃產靈爲生，一時難以改業，所有製成之鹽，商旣不買，官復不收，銷路斷絕，勢必造成生計上極嚴重之恐慌，非設法走私，無以維持生活，雖有嚴刑峻從，亦屬無以禁阻。</p>
<p>官專賣制</p>
<p>竊以爲我國鹽制，參照歷代之成規，斟酌世界之潮流，以採用為最相宜。所謂官專賣之方式，以民製爲主，官製爲輔，官收，官運，官銷爲主，商銷爲輔。茲分別說明其理由如下</p>
<p>（一）我國鹽產，極為豐富，藉製鹽爲菜，以維生計者，爲數極多，在政府未有整個規劃以前，祇能任其製產，隨時指示其改良製產之方法，達到精製之目的。但此類民製之鹽，多不潔凈，含有其他成分，質極惡劣，久爲外人所詬病。自懸於民製之外，由政府酌量設立製鹽公司，並可吸收社會遊資，官商合辦，用機器製鹽，或鼓勵鹽民，自行集資籌設公司以機器製造，以示改良，藉應中外之需要。</p>
<p>（二）我國歷代鹽制，以官收場鹽，為最完善之方法。官收之利。（一）豐戶以官收而工本有著，生計無虞，可以安心勤製。（二）鹽戶所製之鹽，以隨產隨收，無虛停滯，有利可岡，（以前收鹽有定額，產製受限制，鹽戶每以餘鹽走私，或商人私收餘豐（，夾帶運銷，或由不肯官吏，收買餘　，視爲利數）。自願顆粒交官，不樂走私，而場私可以根本杜絕。（三）鹽戶均須將鹽交官，不與商人接觸，則走私之機會旣少，奸商就場配運，重斤夾帶之弊，無目而生。</p>
<p>（三）我國鹽制，向重官運，唐有綱運之法，宋則實行官般。遜淸與民初之際，大抵僻遠之區，運道艱阻，商人不至，或近場地方，私鹽充斥，輒以官運繼其窮。官運之制，原爲</p>
<p>防止走私</p>
<p>准一最善之方法。惟宋時以差役鄕民，使任運輸之勞，亡身破家，滋擾殊甚。而民國以來之官運，共歸官辦者，堆方官並不實行辦運，仍多招商代辦，實同包商。其設局辦運者，則引用親朋，上下分肥，扣費賣私，營業極其腐敗。凡此皆由於運用之不得其當，要不得謂官運制度本身之不善，自不能因噔而廢食。鹽歸官運以後，則過去「偷」，「夾」，「洒」，「賣」，「以鹽運鹽」，諸積弊，可以革除。</p>
<p>（四）鹽自產區運至各銷岸，或於銷岸交通便利之適中地點，收倉貯存，由官躉賣於特許之商號，在指定之範圍以內經售，食戶可向特許之商號購買，在政府統籌配運濟銷，旣收官賣之利，同時又不奪商之利，食戶可以自由購買，旣無淡食之虞，亦無高價之患。</p>
<p>以上所謂宮製官收官運官銷之官專賣，其經營之業務，應視爲一種企業，力矯過去「官辦」之弊，並應遴選擅長經營企業之人材，專責辦理。即應另設國營之鹽業公司，運用經營企業之技術，規劃全國鹽專賣事宜。自製產收買至運銷，一切業務，概由國營之</p>
<p>鹽業公司</p>
<p>負責辦理。懸務行政機關，居於監督指導之地位，本身並不負營運之責，與過去之所謂「官辦」「官運」性質，絕不相同。專賣制度，近世已極盛行，但我國倡行最早，其專賣之對象則爲豐，春秋時管仲治齊，已實行鹽之專賣，歷漢唐宋元，使專賣之方式，微有不同。明淸之季，暨民元以來，改由商人專賣，所有鹽之收買運動，由政府授權商人辦理，而居間課稅，利則歸於豪商。鹽之爲物，效用廣大，人所必需，雖政府倡導自由買賣，在近場或交通便利之地方，人民或尙能自由經營。至銷岸或偏遠之區，小商每爲大商所兼併，自非資力雄厚之商，不能營運，此類商人往往能操奇態斷獨擅其利，因之鹽業之經營，實含有獨佔性，其勢不出於官專實，必入於商專利，按之我國史志，事實彰彰可考。此之所謂官專賣制，乃以國營之鹽業公司負一切營運之責，其組織與業務，無異於私人經營之企業公司，亦即</p>
<p>以私人經營之方式，達成官專賣之目的。惟資本則由國庫撥充，（但亦可以酌收商股）而公司經營之收入，概歸之國庫，（如酌收商股，則按股派息）。即無異將過去</p>
<p>商人獨佔</p>
<p>之權利，忙亂由國家自行經營，而以其收入，補畫國庫，取之於民，而仍用之於民，可謂具有商專賣之優點，而無官專賣之流弊。鹽旣歸政府專賣，則鹽民之生計，政府自能　及，而收買之價格，政府可計算其製產之成本，予以合法之利潤，藉爲決定收買價格之標準。收買價格之規定，旣不致甚低，鹽戶製產，自屬有利。平時各政更可貸款於鹽民，如以前場商之預借工本，出資養竃，並可指導鹽民，組設各種合作社，以减輕鹽民之負擔，　民自不願漏私。同時政府復可瘺顯食戶購買能力，其售價之規定必不致甚高。祗須視鹽之運自產地，計算其成本，運費稅款及經售商之合法利潤，以規定售鹽之牌價。此項牌價，無過去鹽商廝夥之侵蝕，暨付給綱口岸之各項規費，成本旣輕，售價自廉，食戶負擔减輕，自不願食私。可謂具有官尋賣之優點，而無商專賣之流幣。深　目前縣政改革，此項制　等，合乎計劃經濟之原則，比較完　而易行。</p>
<h3>讀者意見　勝昨後的文人</h3>
<p>— 涵秋</p>
<p>勝利是舉國民衆的熱烈希望，勝利了，國民應當慶祝，文人應當多寫些勝利文章。勝利是抗戰將士們的功勞，老百姓應當敬愛，文人應當多寫些歌頌文章。然而中國人的心理反差難揣測。不勝利盼勝利，一直盼了八年，旣勝昨卻又悲觀，總覺得前途沒多多大希望。文人們好像只會罵世，不慣捧塲。保不想一想，國軍如何能與僞軍比？國軍是誓死抗戰，僞軍是茍偷安。同時服裝不好，不見得不能打勝仗。國家窮，國軍沒有帳幕設備，地方又沒有營房，能去露營嗎？要說國軍強姦歸女，這是瞎攫。（中有敵人只有土匪，才姦淫婦女。）在抗戰八年當中，國民革命軍就沒有這類事情發生。勝利了，還能向自己臉上抹灰嗎？寫這樣文章的人，簡直是筆桿犯神經，是多麼對不住八年抗戰的將士！（一九四六·二·一夜，寄目津浦綫賈汪煤礦。）</p>
<h3>社論　社賀我國首任樞機</h3>
<p>羅馬敎宗庇獲十二世於十八日「主教公會」秘密會議席次，宣布升任主敎卅一人為機，內中國主敎靑島宗座代收區代牧亦在其列。敎宗並頒詔，略謂：「任命新樞機主敎，朕久懷此意，徒以阻於戰爭，不克實現；此際戰爭終於結束，吾人乃得實行預定計劃。敎會之普還性茲已增加新光輝，董敎會並不屬於任何一個種族，一種人民，或一個國家，而屬於人類家庭之大衆。」另據同日路透社羅馬電，謂「在梵蒂岡堅固之中世紀墻垣後，敎廷即將連續舉行饒有愆義之集會，以象徵在茲爲戰爭所苦惱之世界內，公敎會復興的生力。據梵蒂岡商級人土稱：此次樞機主敎畢集羅馬，如在過去的人類歷史一樣，是一個歷史的轉捩點；而在每個歷史的轉捩點，公敎會定必顯示其永生的創造活力。木周在梵蒂間集會之樞機，人數之多，向未前有；而此次敎宗任命樞機卅二人，爲數之多，在天主教會史上亦向所未有。」該電又稱：「在樞機聖院中而有首次中國械機出席足以表示敎宗的觀念，並不爲狹隘的歐洲傳統所局限。」在第二次世界大戰雖吿終止而猶有恃强稱覇陰謀破壞世界和平的今日，正在梵蒂岡舉行的莊嚴集會，使我們有種淸凉溫煦的感覺，使我們煩慮的心情，得到寗靜，得到慮安。聖伯多敎堂所發出來的光輝，今日如像過去人類悠長的歷史中一樣，照明了全世界各處的人心。</p>
<p>這次在梵蒂岡的集會是具有極深長的歷史意味的。運次的集會，適在人類經過空前的浩刦以後，而參加道次集會的樞機，來自世界遼遠的各處，這不僅表示天主敎會「聖而且公」的普遍性，亦足以表示天主敎會的超越塵世永遠常新，不以時艱而遭到挫折，反因困苦艱難而絕處逢生，而益增其生動活潑的力量。今日烽火雖息，然斷垣殘瓦，所在多是，人類正剛從一次慘酷的戰爭中過來，而使他們覺翻到人類之整個性的不是世界和平會議，不是各國政治家在鈎心鬥角的國際會議，而是在梵蒂岡中世紀墳垣後在舉行著的集會。那裏纔有眞正的和平，那裏纔是人類整個性和天下一家的表現。天主敎會能於此際將人類的整個性和天下一家的精神表現出來，正足以表示天主敎會本身的充沛有力。</p>
<p>就中國人的立場來說，這次具有歷史意義的集會中，有我國首任樞機田耕莘主敎的參加，此在天主敎會歷史中爲創舉，尤覺意味深長。本報前於獲悉我國　選樞機主敎之際，曾著論有所論列，認爲：「敎宗任命田耕莘主敎爲樞機，表示敎宗如何關心中國的敎務，」並謂：「今敎宗對於中國敎務旣極關心，我政府對基督敎傳教事業又備極維護，深願天主敎能在我關繼續發展，傳中國能逐漸成爲一個基督敎信衆日益見多的同家，不負敎宗及我主席的一番期望。一又謂：「觀乎田耕莘主敎的被選爲樞機，可見天主敎會之在中國已漸臻於成年之域。我們不會忘記明末淸初時，天主敎的傳布，對於我國文化所起的優良影饗，深願今後中國的天主敎信衆……在建設新中國和新世界的工作中，能有卓越的貢獻。」田樞機爲人謙和，志行純潔，况復老成持重，冲澹篤實；此番擢升樞機，個人光榮，本在度外，惟因田樞機之膺選而使中國得以參加敎廷中樞的機密，此實使中國增光；同時樞機以中國人而膺選，更足以表示聖敎會之普遍性，亦足爲敎會增光，我蔣主席對於基督敎會在華事業，至爲關注，此次田氏膺選樞機，會擬派專機迎駕赴渝，可見我政府自　主席以次對田樞機屬望之股。中國之天主敎信衆，今於田樞機之獲選，在精神上獲得舉國一致推崇之領袖，更應有所惕勵，於建國大業上担負其所應担負之任務。</p>
<p>蔣主席此次來滬。在跑馬應民衆歡迎大會席上向民衆所致訓辭，要我們學習外國的道德精神。本報於新生活運動十二燭年曾撰論，對此點有所申述，曾謂：「主席在跑馬廳的訓詞裏，敎我們要學他們的道德精神…西洋的道德精神，包括蘇聯在內，與基督敎結着深耕。他們在道德規律之外，還有宗敎規律來規範他們的行爲。新生活運動以恢復固有道德爲主要課題，在推行方面也許需要一種新的動力。我國固有道德與基督敎的道德規律可以說是二而一的；我們要澈底學習西洋的道德精神，對爲西洋文明之基督敎規律亦不可不多加注意。」推行新生活運動或許需要的一種新的動力是什麼，怕就是基督敎，特別是基督敎裏面的天主敎。天主敎有　嚴的敎規，有嚴密的組織，而且散布於全國。它的傳敎土安貧樂道，拋棄了舒適的塵世生活，而到各處窮鄕僻壞，事主以終，豈不是西洋道德精神的最高表現。新生活運動如期其收效，必加上一種宗敎洗禮；以一種宗敎的熱誠，對個人生活爲澈底的革新。新生活運動以恢復我國固有道德，使個人的生活能够負責任守紀律，我國的固有道德，也就是基督敎信衆所珍視的道德價値，而負責任守紀律尤爲天主敎信衆一貫的精神。新生活運動是建國的基本工作，在這基本工作上，我們需要天主敎信衆的協力。</p>
<p>天主敎不是一種出世的宗敎；如果是出世的話，就不成其為宗敎的了。天主敎有所謂凱旋敎會，有所謂戰鬥敎會，有所謂受難敎會。在現世的天主敎信衆都是屬於所謂戰鬥敎會的信衆，須時時與敵作戰。天主敎的人生觀，因之，是一種戰鬥的人生觀，須時時防衛，時時作戰。這種戰鬥普及於各方面，故對於社會秩序之重建，它亦有不可變易的原則。先教宗良十三世及庇慶十一世，對於社會經濟問題迭頒通諭，對社會秩序之重建，提供了迎敎會的極詳盡而具體的方案，建立了公敎社會經濟的完整體系，以中正和平爲特徵，以「仁愛」爲出發點，爲全民謀福利。這種公教體系奧我國建國最高原則三民主義的精神暗相符合，而中國的天主敎信衆對如何實施公敎社會經濟政策於中國的努力，似猶未够。現當建國之會，中國的天主敎信衆，尤應在此方面多所實獻。</p>
<p>申報爲全國人民的公器，茲因田耕莘主敎之被任爲權機，參加在梵蒂岡正在舉行的饒有歷史意義的集會，謹申數言，用爲祝賀。</p>

<h3>殺害美飛行員案續審　雙方激烈辯論　鏑木高供詞十分狡猾</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕十八日戰犯殺害漢口三美飛行員案，昨晨繼續審訊。原被告兩方辯論仍頗激烈。預計今日將可審判，實屬不可能。據被告辯護人李文少校稱，被告方面辯論尚未完畢，宣判日期尚早。</p>
<p>昨晨開庭時，被告辯護人哈金斯中校提出抗議，反對原告辯護人反詰被告所作書面口供，認為此舉乃違反法律基本原則。原告辯護人韋斯脫中校即反駁，謂被告所作口供顯與事實矛盾，次不能以此作為卸罪之證據，至於謂此舉乃違反法律基本原則，更屬從未聽聞者。</p>
<p>庭上當即暫退會商，結果將被告辯護人所提抗議駁斥。繼訊問日第三十四軍參謀長鏑木正高少將。韋中校訊其是否知日憲兵參加三美飛行員遊行，係第三十四軍之一工作，曾否得執行遊行之伊純中尉關於此事之報告，是否記得美機分發傳單說明不應虐待戰俘，有否得伊純報告謂瑞士領事曾致抗議書與伊，告其遊行事件乃違反國際公法。並問鏑木有關殺害三美飛行員等問題。鏑木供詞含糊，答非所問，而始終堅稱：「吾並未發任何命令」或「吾不知」。竭力將罪責推諉於已死之第三十四軍軍長服部中將及未曾拘獲之伊純。</p>
<p>最後陪審官問鏑本當服部缺席時是否由其代理。答：「是」。韋中校問：「則其所出命令是否能由汝代理執行。」鏑木竟狡猾抵賴，不作確切答覆，僅調：「吾如能與服部直接接洽事務，均由其負責指揮，吾不能改變他的命令。」哈中校起立辯護，並訊問：「執行殺害之命令是否在服部離漢前由其所定。」鏑木答：「是他在走前所發。在我官職範圍內，我不能改變他的命令。」時近中午，庭上宣佈展期，至今晨繼續審訊。</p>

<h3>商務書館職工怠工</h3>
<p>本市商務印書館職工待遇菲薄，每月薪金不過一萬元左右，在此物價暴漲聲中，實難維持生計。職工同人曾向館方提出四項要求，（一）三十四年年底例假一個月，照十二月份薪金全額發給。（二）抗戰慰勞金，上海方面職工平均每人儘得七八千元，後方職工平均每人可得四五萬元，要求發給同額慰勞金，並從速補發。（三）每月薪津不得少於五萬元。（四）（四）（四）要求未解次前，毎人海月暫借五萬元。並曾向社會局請求調解。近以資方迄無確切辦法答復，且近來物價波動益劇，職工生活困難，業於昨日下午一時起，實行怠工。</p>

<h3>生生牧塲經理　沈萬靈被控附逆　偵查終結昨日開庭審訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕繼新新職工檢舉李澤案後，本市生生牧塲塲主沈九成，及其子經理沈萬靈，亦為職工盛阿弟等告發。沈九成聞風早已隱匿無蹤，僅沈萬靈被押。該案已經檢察處偵查終結，昨日上午，在提籃橋高院刑庭，由劉毓桂庭長公開審訊。</p>
<p>沈等被控附逆罪狀</p>
<p>檢舉人呈控沈等之附逆罪養為：（一）先後聘請日人豐島梅野。野口正一卹·關一利等為經理，仗敵勢，欺壓工人。（二）生生牧場與日商南洲收塲合作，易名上海濃業公司。（三）不斷以生產之新鮮牛乳及白脫汕等資敵。（四）職工代表張道德·趙意文·李有根等，要求改善待遇，沈等竟聯絡敵軍二三二二部隊，非理拘禁拷打，含冤被迫停職。（五）沈九成之三子實益，於抗戰期間東渡日本留學，歸後即充任二三二二部隊翻譯，仗勢欺凌職工。（六）尅扣職工配給物品，佔為私有等數項。</p>
<p>檢舉人等到庭作證</p>
<p>由檢舉人送牛奶之盛阿弟·張志雲張志雲·李友根，會計張興泉，營業科職員楊柏英，練習生刁德銘，及以前在沈私寓服務之王家金等，一一到庭，詳述經過。</p>
<p>被吿供述經過情形</p>
<p>詰之被千沈萬靈稱：任且日人為欲藉此掩護公司財產。因在抗戰初期，生生牧塲曾捐助國軍牛奶一萬七千多磅，敵偽因此曾一度在民國二十九年，將我父親綁去。本人當時在學，曾派赴盧山聽訓。又在二十八年秘密參加靑年團，二十九年被偽中華日報登報檢舉，敵偽注意及此，故不得不利用日人，以作掩護。至於將產品資敵事，則係武力威逼，而生生牧場自經職工向濃林部特派員告發後，在去年十二月，為敵偽產業處理局接收，但至今年一月十五日已發還，此事可作我之證明。職工因工潮關係而控訴我，所言全是誣告云。</p>
<p>辯護律師提出證件</p>
<p>並由辯護律師呈上賬冊等證件甚多。檢舉人方面亦里上所攝生生牧塲與敵使作經營時，文件之照片兩幀。日經理關一利則傳訊缺席。庭諭雙方如有證據，可再搜集呈上，該案改期再訊，被告還押。</p>

<p>許紹棣廳長坦白說明</p>
<p>〔本報杭州專訊〕浙敎育廳長許紹棣氏，最近敎育措施，有所說明：（一）本年敎育施政方案，已正積極籌劃，以期一一付諸實施，惟戰後敎育經費，仍感困難，未能配合敎育事業之需要，社會秩序，尙未安定，對敎育設施，不無阻滯。</p>
<p>甄審員生</p>
<p>（二）僞校學生甄審，已分編級畢業兩種，經指定公私立各中學舉辦，已按照定期，於上月中旬分別舉行，參加學生踴躍，考試秩序良好，唯成績殊劣，本廳爲體恤陷區學生，故特從寬辦理，其因故未參加者，亦擬設法補救。僞敎員甄審，定一月廿至二月終爲申請期間，人數尙少，未經甄審及甄審不合格者，一律不得聘用，至各地僞小學均由各市縣政府接收整頓，其敎員亦由各市縣辦理甄審，小學學生母須甄審</p>
<p>添設職校</p>
<p>（三）以本省地理及還境與物產情形，故剏辦職業，亦需配合此種需要，大量培植民生工業幹部技術人才，本廳對省立職校，除將因戰事停辦之杭州高工，高農，金華實農，及定海水產職校，須先設法恢復外，並擬儘先添設棉織工業，及應用化學工業職業學校。</p>
<p>改發膳費</p>
<p>（四）本年省立中等敎員待遇，除生活費依照規定調整外，鐘點費較上年略增，師範學校專科敎員待遇，原與普通科敎員相同，本年亦比照職業學校敎員同採提高，至省校公費生，救濟生，師範生膳食費，上年每名每月發副食費一千五百元，公糧二斗三升，本年因公糧取銷，改發膳費，每名每月四千元，一學期以五個月計算，全省公費救濟師範生等，照中央核定爲六千九百四十。</p>
<p>改組臨中</p>
<p>（五）抗戰勝利，臨中結束，浙西第一第二臨中，分雖改為省立嘉中湖中外，浙東第一第二第三臨中為救濟學生失學起，分別改為省立衢中處中溫中嚴中分部，所有學生分別移併各分部繼續肄業，各臨中學生如因家庭關係轉學他校，應診照一般轉學手續辦理，本應不予分發，至各臨中公費生如轉學他省校省，因各校名額早定，公費不能轉移，須待第二學期該校公費生有缺額時，方得按成績請求遞補。（六）全年敎育經費預算，中央核定總數為一萬四千零八十六萬九千元，　　　費本應繼具預算總計為六十萬五千五百六十二萬元，由省府彙編後，呈中央核撥，目前僅奉中央撥到六千萬元，杯水車薪，無濟於事云。（蝶）</p>

<h3>載刋小言</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>在各項建設工作積極展開的時候，文化工作的重要，是可想而知的。蔣主席在「中國之命運」裏，曾經親過：「須知此次世界大戰最後的效果，無疑的歸結於文化，所以此次戰爭，亦可說是文化戰爭。歐美三百五十年來民族主義民主主義與社會王義的成敗興亡，皆在此一役，中國五千年悠久的文化及其道德精神之興廢，亦以此役爲試金石。此戰若不失敗於侵略主義者之魔手，則人類文明即將刮垢磨光，而中國文化，亦必發揚光大。務望我學術界眞能了解，今日實爲我中國文化繼往開來存亡絕續的最大關頭。</p>
<p>過去在抗戰期間，渝陷區中，破壞多於建設，一部份熟心於文化的工作者，祇能在極審愼極拘束的情形之下保守他們的崗位；後方的情形，因爲物質條件的限制，很難有迅速的發展，能够維持固有的局面，已經相當費力了。因為戰事關係，全國的文化界，被分成了幾個區域，彼此音訊陷絕。</p>
<p>文化所包括的範圍很廣，比較抽象的，那末道德·風尙·都可以說是一國的文化；比較具體的，那末戲劇。歌唱都是文化工作的表顯。但是，最具有形式而最能够產生效果的，就要論到出反了。</p>
<p>一國的文化水準怎樣，可以從他們所出版的書報的質和量上辨別出來，因爲出版的刊物可以流傳各地，可以促成文化的交流。西人有一句話，就是「運輸就是文化」，我們也可以說：「文化就是運輸」。這一句話非常簡單，就是常我們出版的刊物從一地行銷到另一地去，那末我們的思想，也就被從一地運輸到另一地去，借着出版刊物的力量，我們可以宣揚我們固有的文化，使歐美人士，即使不到中國來，也可以知道中國的一切，這一種效果，惟有從事文化工作，可以收穫，尤其是出版，因此出版的力量的偉大，也就不言而喩了。</p>
<p>在抗戰勝利以後，各地的文化界都希望各地的文化，能够互相交流，但因爲運輸沒有暢達，不能儘速進行。在抗戰期間艱苦奮鬥的文化戰士，希望在勝利以後，能够按步就班地做去，但放在面前的，還有許多困難，諸如運輸尙未暢達，造本數字的高漲等，所以目前的出版界，實在正在一個困苦的時期中掙扎着。</p>
<p>以上海一地的出版界而論，勝利以後所出版刋物的種類相當多，總共的數量，並不算少，但每一種刋物單獨的銷路並不大，因爲銷行的地區，祇限上海一隅，同時成本高貴，所以出版界當前的經營方面，實在是相當困難的。</p>
<p>幸而從事出版事業的，並不是以利益爲前提的，或者是要發揮自身的抱負，或者是具有爲社會服務的熱忱，因此即使環境困難，依舊在努力的進行着。</p>
<p>目前最應該做的，可以分兩方面來講，近的方面，可以由出版界的同人聯終起來，互相討論，來應付，解除一切困難，並參考外國出版界的悄形，以爲改進的借鏡；遠的方面，可以鼓勵各界增加讀書的興趣，使出版判物的銷路可以擴展，本刋的方針，就可以向這兩方面進行，希望各界不時予以亙助。</p>
<p>書評</p>
<h3>形勢心理學</h3>
<p>— 王士略</p>
<p>Kart　Lewin原著　正中書局出版大學用書</p>
<p>高覺敷譯述　三十四年十一月滬一版</p>
<p>本文作者王士略先生為我國有數心理學專家現任湖南藍田國立藍田師範學院敎授著作等身——編者</p>
<p>數十年外，格式心理學派之研究動向以及勒溫K.felom等之特殊貢獻，高覺數先生在本書譯序中，已有很扼要的介紹。</p>
<p>據勒溫自述，形勢心理學原埋一書，並非要建立一個新的心理學派。本書的主要的動機之一，乃在於發展一種心理學的語詞，能爲一般所了解，而不囿於任何心理學的派別。這本書供獻一些概念方面的工具，這些概念，係從十餘年外勒溫弟子的許多寬騐研究紬繹而得，並曾在許多實騐研究中求得證騐。勒溫自信不管派別如何，這些概念是爲許冬心理的研究程序之基本概念。</p>
<p>勒溫亦承認僅僅應用形勢幾何學，實不能解決心理學的問題，獨如應用歐氏幾何學或李曼幾何學不能解決物理的問題。不過，近年來有一種明顯的傾向，就是任何一種心理學的理論，必都須預先假定某些空間的概念。例如「行爲乃是人與環境之亟數」這個公式，似已得一般心理學者的公認。這就含有一個理論的場合的命題（Atheoretical　Field　Propsition）。甚至以制的反射爲基本原則之研究，亦承認所右心理的行爲，都有賴於「一羣同時存在的若干事實」，（赫爾Hull）這豈不是等於說，有賴於一羣同時存在的若干事實作爲一個空間的場合。允有進者，任何心理學派都應用一個推論（Construct）作爲一個基本的動的概念。這個據論，實含有向量（Vector）的性質：如激動的傾向（Kxcitatory　Tenfency），奮力（driae）力必處（libido）或心理的勢力（Psychogical　Force）等概念，也都預先假定心理的方向，並假定這些方向所坐落的一個空間。</p>
<p>山上所述，可知心理學之空間問題，不論任何心理學派別，都必須予以解決，勒溫自信，不以歐氏幾何學而以形勢幾何學和徑向幾何學（Hodological　Geometry）之名詞在心理學方而作空間的描述，殊具有明確的數學的意義。這樣的研究方法和概念對於行爲之叙述說明和預測，有何貢獻，勒溫在他的（Formalization　and　Progress　hiPsychology）一文裏，曾有很明顯的表白。我們無論是否贊同勒溫的主張都不能不承認他和他的弟子們獨闢蹊徑慘淡經營的勞績。</p>
<p>本書的譯者，過去對於重要的心理學文獻之介紹，已有很大的貢獻。本書之迻譯，尤其字斟句酌，煞費匠心，一部份譯稿，筆者幸得先覩爲快。名著名譯，可謂二美俱具。我相信治自然科學和社會科學的人，若能加以研究，必可獲得許多新穎的啓示。</p>
<h3>讀書樂</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>如果召集上海全市的出版家開一次會議，討論出版刊物的銷路間題，那末一定會同聲感慨地說上海雖則有了五百五十萬人口，但是讀書的人，是那末地少。</p>
<p>論理，按照人口的比例，每一種刊牧的銷數，一定可以比目則所有的銷路增加十倍，但事實與理論完全不符。</p>
<p>有許多人說，上海人所以不讀書，因爲上海是一個娛樂場所取多的地方，因此把所有的空間時間，都消磨在其他娛樂之中。一般的男子不讀書，一般的締女不讀書，職業靑年不讀書，在學靑年，除了課本之外，也很少讀其他的書。</p>
<p>當然有許多例外，而且應該列入例外的人也有相當數目，吾則刊物的銷路將更爲减少。</p>
<p>我以爲讀書是最有樂趣的事，自然在未能體騐到讀書之前，是不會說讀書是有樂趣的，這和其他娛樂，正是相同，在沒有了解某一種娛樂方法之前，我們也許會拒絕嘗試。但別種娛樂方法，自會有人來勸導·引誘，惟有讀書，却需要自動。</p>
<p>一般人在走出校門以後，就與書籍脫離關係，可是他們因此犧牲了許多人生的樂趣，他們拋棄了吸收新知識的機會。純以讀書的樂趣來講，那末如果是一個日間有職業的人，在職業的餘暇裏，穿上隨便的衣服，選擇屋子的一角，翻開幾頁與職業有關係的書籍，吸收最新的知識，立刻就可以在職業上應用起來，在應用的時候，就會有一種無上的快感；如果翻閱幾頁足資消遣的書籍，那末正可以使緊張的神經安愉下來，這種閒散而悠然自得的樂趣，祇有讀書，可以獲得。</p>
<p>如果是一個家庭主婦，那末在家事操作完畢以後，正可以翻開心愛的書籍，不受什麼拘束，可以得到一種悠閒的樂趣。而且家事的操作大多要用勞力，利用讀書正可以作精神上的調劑，是最合於人生修養的條件的。</p>
<p>如果是一個在學靑年，那末他正可以挑選各種介紹新知識的刊物，來充實自己，增進自己的智慧。</p>
<p>中國人向來看重讀書人，因爲讀書人自能造就一種文雅風絡，所謂「腹有詩書氣自華」。一個飽讀詩書的人，和一個目不識丁的人，無論談吐，舉止，都是大不相同的。</p>
<p>當然時代是在進步，因此現代的人所讀的書必需切合實用，適應環竟。更不能把有用的時間，看無謂的書籍。講到時間的經間的。因爲一種經騐的獲得來，要費許多年月，嘗受幾次失敗，旦用賈書的方去，可以在最短的時期中，獲得經騐。無論那一個禾曾享受讀書的樂趣的人立刻就可以着手，體騐讀書的樂趣，在決定先讀什麼書的時候，祗要先問問自己最希望知道那一些學問或事物，就不難找到最配自己需要的書籍。</p>

<p>錄自張道藩先生「文化運動的前瞻」一文</p>
<p>「文化的本質，是向上與白田，亦即黑格蘭所說的一或一種較高的解放」。這解放包含個人心靈求向上，與民族精神求自由。他的過程，就是一種運動。我國自淸末變法以來，文化運動的路綫很多，步驟亦亂，當時外來的文化，旣未能善爲選擇與吸收，而國際的政治侵略，又動搖了我固有的優良民族德性，晚淸百年間，「國家民族在政治，經濟，社會，倫理與心理各方面，無不頹風外暴，危機內伏，幾至毀滅我再生的基礎，杜絕我復興的根源」（引　蔣主席語）如果沒有國父一面適應世界的潮流，一面繼承歷史的傳統，倡導三民主義的文化運動，今天中國文化不會重新得到向上的途徑。</p>
<p>文化運動的過程，應該包含兩個階段：一是文化鬥爭，一是文化建設，三民主義的文化運動，在國民革命過程中，業已完成其鬥爭的使命。今後的任務，應該是向積極的建設途上上前進，以完成心理，倫理，社會，政治，經濟等五大建設為最終目的。</p>
<p>三十二年冬中央所頒佈的文化運動綱領，曾扼要的提出五方建設的原則：（雖則在三年前發表的綱領，但在目前這個時候，依舊是應該奉行的）</p>
<p>心理建設：建立革命的人生觀，以改革國人有且偸生，冷酷自私的惡習，而能提起積極精神，確立自信，力行革命</p>
<p>倫理建設：改進人民的行為，恢復民族固有的道德，從而發揚光大，養成國民高尙健全的人格，使我們四萬萬五千萬同胞，人人能够犧牲小我，捨己利羣，盡忠國家，盡孝民族，崇信重義，仁民愛物，和平互助。</p>
<p>社會建設：使社會上一切分子的生活行動，都能運循一定的規律，使社會一切有關人民福利的基本事業，都有程序的興建起來。</p>
<p>政治建設：以奮發國民自主自動的精神爲基礎，加强行使權的能力，促使全民政治的實現。</p>
<p>經濟建設：本人盡其才，地盡其利，物盡其用，貨暢其流之遺敎，以充實國防，裕厚民生」</p>
<h3>奮鬥邁進之正中</h3>
<p>— 文耀</p>
<p>正中當局在抗戰期間，為出版界叟了最大責任，記者為報道出版界動態起見，走訪讠局，寫此介紹。</p>
<p>在新生的中國，出版界中最年靑，最當朝氣，以及將來的前途，正中恐怕是最有希望的一員</p>
<p>敵人的砲火，不但要毀滅我們的生靈，同時更需要毀滅我們的文化。正中就在慘遭損失下，隨同政府西遷；那時我國出版事業大部留守滬港，形成隔絕，後方的供書問題，要靠它來支持大局了。</p>
<p>防空洞和桐油燈的生活，不足以表示它底艱苦；烽火連天中出版二千餘種參考書，也不能說是偉蹟；唯有犧牲私利，解救了整個大後方敎科書的恐慌，數千萬學生不至無書廢學，才是値得稱頌的一件事。</p>
<p>事情發生在敵窺西南的時候，那時國定敎本尙未編印，連滬港的舊審定本也無法內運，敎本的恐慌，已達極點。正中就毅然把他們編著的建國本敎科書全部版權貢獻國家，以便各地敎育機關自行翻印，就地供應，總算勉渡難關。即以後敎部編的國定本，一部分也以正中新中國本做藍本，重加修訂而已。</p>
<p>去冬正中來滬復業後，除大量印製敎科書外，並首創日出新書一種。在恢復生產困難聲中，能有這樣的成績，的確難能可貴。聽說最近還要提高生產數量，增至日出兩種。春銷過後，大概就會實現。</p>
<p>正中並沒有過人的資金，和特殊的優勢，不過數年來全憑堅强的毅力，於本位上苦幹出不可磨滅的史蹟。假使說它是中國出版界的懇星，母寗說它是復興文化陣中的一個英勇的戰士。</p>
<p>我默祝着正中能本其過去光榮，完成更偉大的任務，而且永恒地年靑。</p>

<h3>美國出版業展望</h3>
<p>美國「星期六文藝許論週刋」總編輯溫德里區最近發表談話稱：</p>
<p>圖書出版業界人士展望一九</p>
<p>四六年以後的前途，希望保持其戰時的盈利率，但他們深感他們今後需要一個出版和銷售的計劃。出版商，紡者和圖書銷售商都認為一九三九年後圖書銷售量的激增也許只一種戰時的繁榮，除非因科書銷售量激增而起的問題得到解次而銷售大量書刋與國內外的技術有所改進，才能穩定下來。</p>
<p>美國商務部主辦的「國內商業」月刋第雨四號戴稱：自一九四三年以來，美國的出書量已較前倍增。一九四五年出書總値約在十五萬萬元左右。出書數量實在並未倍增，只因書價也時在高漲，不過它的增加也不可謂不大。印刷業在戰時物資缺乏和種種限制下業務空前興盛。兒童讀物的銷售量創最高紀錄。多歡和圖書有關的商業都大大發達並擴張它們的業務。百貨商店，藥店，圖書雜誌社，經售商和圖書俱樂部全都擴充了它們的賣書業務。</p>
<p>最近讀醫興趣趨向可從購買的動作中窺見之。在實用的入門書的王國裏，退伍軍人及其家屬們所最喜過問的書爲有關住宅建築，室內裝飾和烹飪的書籍。</p>
<p>有大量需要的新書是職業入鬥書籍和敎科書（內包括戰時敎學法經騐的結晶）技術和專業用書。兒童讀物銷售量仍將繼續增加。書籍對家庭由戰時生活重新調整爲平時生活的問題的解次當有莫大帮助。宗敎書，尤其是聖經的銷售量，亦將大見增加。</p>
<p>就讀者興趣這麼廣泛的事實看來，人們的閱讀能力仍有待進一步的發掘。「芝加哥太陽報」聖誕節號以大塊篇幅刋登關係作者，編者和出版家新水準的專文多篇，文中顯示出版界人士曾面臨着如何維持與戰爭俱來的書刊暢銷以及適應這種需求的問題。如果他們不能解次這些問題。如果他們不能解次這些問題，他們就難免有不景氣或過度繁盛的危險。世界出版公司董事長齊文氏概括地說：『一切對我們都很有利，文肓大减已日漸使我們的市場擴大。人們對政治經濟發展的興趣的覺醒，賡續刺激人們對書刋的需求……而且書報是培養社會氣的利器。』</p>
<p>某些出版方面的嘗試反映出這種精神。手册一類書籍的大大成功和再版書的盛銷己爲其他多種二角五分的再版書開一前路。第一輯通俗叢書（共二十册）於一月二日三版，內中有一本史坦培克的「憤怒的葡萄」，結果市場都很好，風行一時。</p>
<p>其他出版經騐——像再版書般也離開實騐階段——其中包括由那些深知讀書需求的編撰人員編印的時事新聞類型的書籍。『展望』雜誌最近二年來就出版這一類的書刋好幾種。全是由該刋工作人員編撰而交由各書局出版的。的翰遜所著的『威爾遜傳』就是這種集體創作之一；斯特納的『全國一家』（One　Nation）又是其一，『展望』是個畫刋，是以這些書多是圖文並茂的。</p>
<p>岡書業人士於覺察到圖書的空前盛銷之餘，均相戒審愼從事。「出版家週刊」最近發表專論一篇，籲請書業方面調查書店和其他書市塲現狀而穩定發行工作，並鼓勵後起之秀。</p>

<h3>Military Demobilization Conference Concludes: Chairman Chiang Urges Strict Adherence to Duty, Achieves Three Demands of Efficiency, Refinement, and Speed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 19th] The Military Demobilization Conference held its closing ceremony at 9:00 AM this morning. Chairman Chiang personally attended and delivered instructions. He first praised the generals for their deep understanding of the government's policy of peaceful unification and their conscientious adherence to the ceasefire order, considering them worthy of commendation. He then encouraged the generals to firmly uphold the military's duty to protect the country and its people, and advised them not to be overly concerned about current political and diplomatic matters. Subsequently, he exhorted them to raise the quality of officers and soldiers, rectify troop discipline, and strengthen officer and soldier training, achieving the three demands of "substantial," "elite troops," and "rapid," hoping to implement the doctrine of elite troops and modernize the Chinese army. After Chairman Chiang's speech, General Wedemeyer was invited to speak, concluding around 11:00 AM. The Chairman then personally led all the generals in 125 cars to the foot of Zijin Mountain to pay respects at the mausoleum of the national father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen. At 12:00 noon, they proceeded to the Wuliang Temple in Linggu Temple to hold a public memorial service for the fallen soldiers. After the ceremony, a picnic was held in the open space in front of the Memorial Tower for the Fallen Soldiers. Each person received a package of sandwiches, fruit, and refreshments. After eating, they were free to tour the scenic area for a while. The generals then returned to the city by military vehicle, bringing the historically significant Military Demobilization Conference to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 19th] At today's closing ceremony of the Military Demobilization Conference, General Wedemeyer, accompanied by General Collum, personally offered two points: (1) Recalling how, when he first came to China, he suggested gradually streamlining the original 370 divisions of the army to reduce and strengthen them, so that today the great task of resisting Japan could finally be completed. (Applause) He believed that China was a poor country and could not bear such large military expenditures for a long time. Even a wealthy country like the United States only allowed itself to have ten to twelve divisions in peacetime. (Applause) Next, he made an analogy regarding the adjustment of officer ranks. He said: Although he himself is currently a three-star general (Lieutenant General), when he returns to his country in the future and the original system is restored, he must remove two stars and regain his Major General title. But all of this is not worth mentioning. We thank God for His kindness in giving us the opportunity to serve. We can educate our children and enjoy a minimum standard of living, which is enough to satisfy us. (Loud applause) (2) The relationship between officers and soldiers must be strengthened. He said: After the American army stops marching, officers must first check the health, diet, nutrition, camping ground, and all equipment of the soldiers, and even whether the clothing is suitable, before paying attention to their personal needs. (Loud applause) In modern warfare, to seek the sacrifice of officers and soldiers and to have a unified determination, the relationship between officers and soldiers must first be strengthened. Finally, he said with great certainty that if Chinese officers can implement the Chairman's reorganization plan, the Chinese army will be modernized. If China succeeds in reorganizing its army and building the country, China will become a great, strong, prosperous country. His words were extremely insightful, and the audience applauded more than ten times.</p>
<h3>Zheng Jiemin Tells Our Reporter: Difficulties in the Mediation Department Have Passed; Military Situation in Shanxi Has Greatly Eased</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 18th] Tonight, at a cocktail party hosted by Ye Jianying, Zheng Jiemin told reporters that the major difficulties of the Mediation Department have been overcome. Currently, the only remaining issue is the surrender problem. The domestic surrender has been largely completed long ago and should not be a problem. According to the reporter's inquiries, the Mediation Department is currently discussing the procedures for restoring transportation. If the local groups have reached an agreement on restoring transportation, they can start restoring it according to the agreement without waiting. Yesterday, a transportation group departed for Botou on the Jinpu Line, with Peng Gunong as the government representative, Dang Renmin as the CCP representative, and Wedeton as the US representative. Today, two more transportation groups will depart, one for Qinglongqiao on the Guisui Line and one for Yuanshi on the Pinghan Line. The liaison group sent by the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Communications to the Execution Department has begun its work.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 18th] Since the Taiyuan and Houma groups of the Execution Department arrived in Shanxi, the military situation in Shanxi has eased in the past ten days. In the direction of Qin County on the Baijin Road southeast of Taiyuan, the Communist army has stopped attacking, but the threat to the defending troops has not been completely eliminated. The Taiyuan Central Group, composed of Major General Zou Lufu (government), Colonel Xu Guangda (Communist), and Colonel Heli, plans to go to Qin County within a day or two. The negotiation difficulties of the inspection group have been reported to the Execution Department for instructions, but there is still no news. According to the authorities in the war zone, Quwo and Xinlu, two cities only 20 miles away from Houma Station, are both owned by the National Army. On January 11, one month after the ceasefire order was issued, Houma Station, located between Quwo and Xinjiang, was suddenly occupied by the Communist army. It is said that the Communist army regards it as an important military location, so according to the ceasefire method, the National Army in Quwo and Xinjiang should withdraw a distance of 60 miles from Houma. Regarding the recent military conflicts, the reporter has not heard of any in Bingshi in a week, but officials said that a dozen days ago, six National Army transports were attacked by the Communist army in Dongmiaocun on their way to Wenshui, a National Army controlled area. All of them were captured and sent to Wenshui. The National Army's two-month salary was also robbed. As for the restoration of transportation, officials stated that the transportation lines from Taiyuan north to Datong, south to Linfen, and east to Shijiazhuang are all under the control of the National Army. The restoration of transportation only requires the Communist army not to destroy it again. After the CCP representative Xu Guangda and others arrived in Taiyuan from Datong by car on the 15th, they planned to rest for a while before starting work. US representative Colonel Heli told Xu that the sooner we start working, the sooner the people of Shanxi, who have suffered from the war, will have peace. So Xu and government and US representatives visited the cabinet official the next day and started working. Colonel Heli was fair and straightforward, and during the joint meeting on that day, he solemnly pointed out that if any party destroys it again in the future, they should be killed without mercy.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 19th] The staff of the Mediation Execution Department will increase again, because each of the eight transportation groups needs many cadres. It is reported that the original plan was for 170 people, but now it has exceeded 200 people. Each group needs at least six people on each side to cope.</p>

<h3>Yunnan Hui Leaders Prepare to Form an Alliance</h3>
<p>Propose Six Demands</p>
<p>[Our Kunming Correspondent, 18th] Yunnan Hui leaders such as Ma Ju have recently been preparing to form the China Hui Muslim Alliance in Kunming. On the 18th, in the name of the preparatory committee of the alliance, they issued a letter to the Hui Muslims, proposing six demands: (1) Elect representatives according to the proportion of the Hui Muslim population in various places to participate in the National Assembly and various levels of public opinion organs and government organizations. (2) Immediately implement the agreement between Zhang Zhizhong, the central plenipotentiary representative, and the representatives of the people of Xinjiang. (3) The National Bank should be requested to provide the Hui Muslims with low-interest loans to relieve the extreme poverty of the Hui Muslims and develop the Hui Muslim economy. (4) The materials of the Relief Administration should be fairly distributed to the Hui Muslims in various places. (5) According to the special life and culture of the Hui Muslims, the government should allocate funds to set up Hui Muslim schools that meet the actual needs, and prohibit local officials from infringing on and misappropriating the temple property that supports the education, culture, and economy of the Hui Muslims in various places. (6) Hui Muslims who are conscripted into the army must be incorporated into the same unit, and Hui Muslims or people who have research and knowledge of Hui Muslims should be appointed as officers to avoid difficulties and unnecessary disputes due to different lifestyles.</p>
<h3>Speculation is Active in North China; Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Gold Exceeds 160,000 Mark</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 19th] Speculators in North China are taking advantage of the changes in the situation in the Northeast to make waves and deliberately raise prices.

According to his report, the disaster situation in Hunan Province is indeed more tragic than in other provinces in Central China, especially in western and northern Hunan. Houses in important cities have been almost completely destroyed, and many people are living in ruins. In addition, the years of natural disasters and man-made disasters in various places along the lake have caused a severe food shortage in the land of fish and rice. Ordinary people often find it difficult to obtain bark and grass roots. Currently, the price of rice in Changsha is 25,000 yuan per stone, and around 30,000 yuan in Yueyang. In addition, Hunan people have reported more than 100 cases of corruption and dereliction of duty, which are currently being investigated and handled separately.</p>

According to non-official sources, the Northeast issue will no longer make sacrificial concessions. Any act that damages our sovereignty and territory will not be recognized.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Correspondent, 18th] In the gloomy atmosphere in the Northeast, spring plowing has been delayed. According to Liu Guangpei, director of the Relief Branch, there is a lack of manpower, livestock, and seeds in the Northeast. The Northeast, which used to be our country's granary, has changed greatly after 14 years of vicissitudes. If spring plowing is delayed, then a famine will follow. The situation at that time is unimaginable. Liu will soon go to Shanghai to discuss everything for the relief supplies in the Northeast, especially the spring plowing issue.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Ordered to Repair Four Lines; Jinpu Road Gets Priority; Jiaoji, Longhai, and Pinggui Roads Repaired in Sequence</h3>
<p>[United States News Agency, Beiping, 19th] The Mediation Executive Department announced today that the Ministry of Communications has been ordered to immediately engage in repairs at nine strongholds along the Jinpu, Jiaoji, Longhai, and Pinggui Roads. The Executive Department Railway Management Group has given priority to repairing the Jinpu Road, which runs through the north and south. Although 322 kilometers of track between Tianjin and Xuzhou has been damaged or damaged and cut into four sections, the repair work is much easier than the Pinghan Road, which is severely damaged. After the Jinpu Road is repaired and north-south traffic is re-established, communication in eastern China can be restored, and the economic and political stability of the entire region can be promoted materially. A team from the Railway Management Group has arrived in Botou, and with the assistance of engineers from the Ministry of Communications, has begun repair work towards Dezhou. Another team of engineers and management group personnel from the Ministry of Communications will be left in Yucheng, 35 miles northwest of Jinan, to advance northward to meet the personnel in Botou. There are two major sections of railway destroyed in this area, one between Dongguang and Dezhou, totaling 54 kilometers, and the other between Dezhou and Yucheng, 85 kilometers long. To the south of Jinan, another management group mobile team and a team of engineers from the Ministry of Communications will be left in Tai'an to advance southward, and the fourth team has already started working northward at the intersection of Jinpu and the Grand Canal. South from Taian to Wucun, 57 kilometers of railway was wounded, and 126 kilometers between Yanzhou and Liguo Station could not operate trains. The Jiaoji Road will be given the second priority for road repair. There are three major facilities on the line, totaling 85 kilometers seriously damaged. The Ministry of Communications has been ordered to start road repair work eastward from Zhangdian and westward from Gaomi. As for the degree of damage to the Longhai Road, there has not yet been a definite report. One group will go east from Xuzhou, and one group will go west from Donghai. Pinggui Road was given the fourth priority, and the engineering team and management team will start road repair work in a few days on a 23-kilometer section between Nankou and Shacheng, and will prepare to complete work on the damaged sections north and northwest of Datong.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Road Repair Materials Have Been Obtained</p>
<p>According to the director of the Railway Management Group, the materials used for road repair were obtained from several sources. Large quantities of materials are currently stored in Tianjin, Beijing, and Hankou and will be put into use immediately. Other railways that are currently considered not urgently needed will be dismantled and used on railways that have been given priority for repair. It is reported that the entire Jingwu Railway and a single track section of the Tianjin Qinhuangdao double track section will be dismantled and used. In addition, part of the materials currently stored in Japan will be transported to China for use by Chinese railways. 140,000 sleepers will be transported to Shanghai and Tanggu in the near future. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will also supply materials.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Sends Out Engineering Personnel</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] According to a report from the Ministry of Communications, repairs near Botou on the Jinpu Line, near Anyang on the Pinghan Line, and near the Great Wall on the Pinggui Line will begin within days.

<p>Premier's Proposal The Executive Yuan also passed Premier Song's proposal at today's routine meeting (to establish a textile machine manufacturing company with government assistance). The original text of the proposal is as follows: It has been found that there are many textile machine factories taken over from the enemy and puppets this time. Based on their equipment, the spindles and looms needed in my country can be supplied domestically after several years of sorting out and expansion. The China Textile Construction Company will be completely transferred to commercial operation after two years, so the manufacture of textile machines should be mainly commercial at this time, and the government should give strong assistance to promote its success. It is now proposed to evaluate the textile machine factories taken over and use them as government shares to serve as the foundation for the establishment. In addition, commercial shares should be solicited as much as possible to serve as capital, and a textile machine manufacturing company should be organized in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law. If the commercial shares are insufficient, the government will allocate funds to join the government shares. The current textile factories of various merchants can actively subscribe for shares, and the company can be formally established within this month. The government shares in the company can also be sold to commercial shares at any time, so that the government's original intention of promoting commercial operation can be implemented. Is this feasible? Please decide.</p>
<h3>New Life Movement Celebrated in Various Places</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th] Today is the 12th anniversary of the New Life Movement. Memorial meetings were held in the accompanying capitals, Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, Shanghai, Chengdu, Guiyang and other places. Sending Huaibei Japanese Prisoners of War and Overseas Chinese Can be Completed in Five Months</p>
<h3>Repatriation of Japanese Prisoners of War and Nationals in North China Expected to Conclude Within Five Months</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch of the 19th] Currently, there are over 240,000 Japanese prisoners of war and nationals remaining in the four provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan. If transportation on all lines is reliably restored, it is hoped that they can all be repatriated to their home country via Tanggu within five months. According to the relevant authorities of the 11th War Area, the 11th War Area originally had 114,899 Japanese prisoners of war and 217,544 Japanese nationals. After the surrender, 75,813 Japanese prisoners of war and 75,585 Japanese nationals have already been repatriated. A total of 151,396 Japanese nationals have not yet been repatriated. This work is already being handled by our country. Currently, General Liu Xuesong, the commander of the Tanggu Fortress, is responsible at Tanggu. However, the dispatch of ships and the security work from Tanggu to Dengzhou are now the responsibility of the U.S. Navy's First Division, or will be assisted by them. Lieutenant General Melasky stated that the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and nationals will not be completed, and the organization he presides over will not be concluded for even a single day. The agreement between China and the United States on the repatriation of prisoners stipulates that China shall, upon notification from the U.S., detain and hand over to the U.S. any prisoners of war or nationals from the concentration camps deemed to be war criminals by the U.S. The work of educating Japanese prisoners of war and nationals has already begun in the Japanese prisoner of war concentration camp in Xiyuan, Beiping. Lectures, books, newspapers, dramas, movies, and slogans are all used as educational tools, but Japanese people are also allowed to listen to Tokyo broadcasts. According to the person in charge, the Japanese people in the concentration camp are most interested in listening to Tokyo broadcasts every day.</p>
<h3>St. John's Church Rebuilt in Kunming to Commemorate Allied Soldiers</h3>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Northeast China and Korea Not Repatriated by the Soviets, Apparently Undergoing Training for Future Use</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, Dispatch of the 19th] According to well-informed government sources, the United Press reporter was told today that, as of now, the Soviet Union has shown no signs of preparing to repatriate Japanese troops from Northeast China, North Korea, Sakhalin Island, or the Kuril Islands. On the other hand, the Soviets are apparently training these troops for future use. The fighting in Northeast China, North Korea, Sakhalin Island, and the Kuril Islands was very short, and the number of Japanese casualties in the fighting against the Soviets before the end of the war was relatively small. After the Soviet Union entered the war, the Japanese had twelve divisions stationed in Northeast China, three divisions in North Korea, and another division defending Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. In addition, there were railway guard units, border guard units, and armed Japanese residents. The total number of Japanese troops in these areas is estimated at 500,000. It is learned that although stubborn senior officers in the Kwantung Army have been imprisoned, generally speaking, only a small proportion of the Japanese troops have been detained by the Soviets. According to the information obtained, the Soviet army has divided the Japanese troops into three categories: (1) Leaders and commanders, mostly belonging to the "young and vigorous faction." (2) All Japanese prisoners of war with anti-Soviet sentiments, who are currently undergoing political indoctrination. (3) Japanese troops who have no anti-Soviet sentiments or strong political beliefs, who are now playing an important role in organizing Japanese civilians under Soviet supervision. According to well-informed government sources, the Japanese troops who have been disarmed are prohibited from communicating with their families. They have learned that life in their home country is extremely difficult, and as a result, a large number of them do not want to return home. The training program includes various principles such as democracy and social revolution, the future of Japan, and a people's autonomous government to replace foreign control.</p>
<h3>Constitutional Charter Review Meeting Concludes for Now</h3>

This year's Lantern Festival and the Maitreya Vajra Dharma Assembly at Ta'er Monastery are the largest gathering in the Northwest Mongolian and Tibetan border areas since the victory.

Several painters gathered at the venue, vying to capture the picturesque scenery. For the past three days, people have been worshipping the Buddha and receiving blessings on their heads. Old goods are displayed in a mixed fashion, and people exchange goods. The scene is bustling and harmonious. On the night of the Lantern Festival, the curtain was raised high, and images of the heavens of the Pure Land, sculpted from butter, were displayed, with brilliant colors and lifelike features.</p>
<h3>Marshall to Fly to Taiyuan to Inspect the Implementation of the Ceasefire Order in Shanxi</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch of the 18th] Marshall will fly to Taiyuan within the week to personally inspect the implementation of the ceasefire order in Shanxi. Zhou Enlai and Zhang Zhizhong will accompany him. The Taiyuan authorities have already begun preparations to welcome him.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch of the 18th] This newspaper's reporter arrived in Taiyuan on the 11th by plane of the Executive Headquarters, and is still the first reporter from the rear of Chongqing to visit Taiyuan after its recovery. The enemy ruled this city for eight years, leaving behind nothing new except for a New Malu Road and countless piles of garbage blocking the roads. The roads inside and outside the city have been in disrepair for eight years, full of bumps and flying dust; the city houses are mostly leaning walls and dilapidated, crumbling. Of the more than 30 factories that Mr. Yan Xishan painstakingly managed before the war in the north of the city, except for the heavy and difficult-to-move parts of the steel plant, 60% of the machines in the other factories were moved to the northeast by the Japanese. The remaining machines have also been excessively used, worn out, and damaged. Fortunately, Mr. Yan Xishan took over quickly, and there was no loss of factory machinery and materials before and after the Japanese surrender. Since the ceasefire order was issued, especially after the arrival of the Taiyuan team of the Executive Headquarters, this ancient city with 150,000 people has been filled with a peaceful atmosphere. More than 200 shops have opened, and the narrow streets are crowded with pedestrians, mostly military and political personnel returning from western Shanxi in gray cotton uniforms, and farmers in tattered clothes coming to the city for sightseeing. Japanese soldiers and nationals have been rarely seen on the streets recently. The public security situation in the surrounding villages is still good. People entering and leaving the city gates must be checked for residence permits. All primary and secondary schools in the city have started classes, but they all lack funds and complete desks and chairs, and face many difficulties. The National Revolutionary University, which has been long overdue, was reopened in Bingzhou on New Year's Day. Governor Yan still serves as the president of the university, and Liang Huazhi serves as the dean of education. There are more than 200 students. Shanxi University has not yet been moved back from the west. There are four newspapers: Zhenzhong, Fuxing, Minzhong, and Guomin, and one evening newspaper, Minzhong Wanbao. The puppet Allied currency has not yet been exchanged here. General transactions are based on the legal tender, so the black market exchange rate of the Allied currency to the legal tender is about six yuan to one yuan. There is a branch of the Agricultural Bank of China here, which is solely responsible for agricultural loans. Most of the wired telephones in the province have been destroyed. The radio station of the Ministry of Transportation's Telegraph Bureau can communicate with Beiping and Xi'an. Railway transportation: the Zhengtai Line has been unimpeded since the ceasefire order was issued, and the Tongpu Line can barely reach Datong in the north and Linfen in the south.</p>

<h3>Important Developments in the Atomic Secrets Case: U.S. Detectives Arrive in Canada; Rumors of a Vice-Ministerial Level Person Among Those Detained in Canada; Canada Cancels Orders from the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Shanghai-Taihua Dispatch of the 18th] Several U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrived here today, causing speculation. It is hidden that the development of the Canadian government's investigation of the leakage of atomic secrets and government secrets information may affect the United States. It is rumored that the Canadian government cannot point out a certain country involved in the case due to diplomatic treaty relations. This statement is inaccurate. According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs personnel, when the 22 people currently detained in the secret chamber of the camp office are tried in whole or in part in the future, the foreign country will be pointed out. According to unofficial government sources, the foreign country is the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa Dispatch of the 19th] In the Canadian government's investigation of the leakage of atomic secrets and government secrets information, the police are still arresting suspects and detaining witnesses. It is heard that among those detained, one person seems to be at the vice-ministerial level. [Also Montreal Dispatch] The Montreal Evening News reported that the Canadian police searched McGill University, the Foreign Exchange Administration, the telephone company, and the University of Montreal (that is, the location of the National Research Institute) here last Friday, and captured six people related to the atomic secrets leakage case. The city police have been secretly following the tracks of Russians for several months. [Also Ottawa Dispatch] The Canadian government's investigation of the leakage of classified information is now linked to the investigation of the uranium production site of the Duraldu Gold Mine. According to the Montreal Daily News, Soviet agents attempted to purchase black market uranium ore for 500,000 Canadian dollars, but the buyer did not move the uranium ore out of Canada. The government bought the mine not long ago and announced an investigation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa Dispatch of the 18th] The Ottawa Police Department revealed today that the person who exposed the large espionage network in Canada was Gouzenko, a young counselor at the Soviet Embassy in Canada. He, his wife, and young children are guarded and protected by the Canadian police. Gouzenko approached the city police department in the second half of last year and secretly reported a large espionage network spread throughout Canada. It is learned that the police department immediately sent personnel to monitor his movements. In September of last year, the police detained four Russians in Gouzenko's apartment and searched his residence. Two of them were former Soviet Embassy officials.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York Dispatch of the 18th] The Toronto Star reported that the Soviet Ambassador to Canada, Zarubin, left Canada for Moscow a month ago because he knew that Canada would announce the Soviet affair.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow Dispatch of the 19th] Soviet newspapers today published a statement by Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King regarding foreign envoys stealing secret information, but did not comment on it.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Ottawa Dispatch of the 18th] Regarding the arrest of a Canadian official in the United Kingdom, Construction Minister Howe recently said that this matter is not related to the atomic secrets leakage case. The official has not yet provided detailed explanations on this matter. According to certain sources, what was leaked was probably secrets related to radar or "Iroquois radio." The Minister of National Defense also announced that information about "Iroquois radio" was exchanged with the Soviet Union during the war. As for rumors that Canada would sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, there is no such thing. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement denying it. It is widely rumored here that a well-known industrialist has already been arrested, but this has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa Dispatch of the 19th] It is learned that Canada has cancelled 25 orders, including Soviet orders worth approximately 24 million US dollars, because the Soviet Union believes that the terms are "too harsh." The government solemnly stated that this move is purely a commercial negotiation and has nothing to do with the government's investigation of alleged Soviet intelligence agent activity in Canada.</p>
<h3>Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davies, Defends the Soviet Union; If Atomic Bomb Secrets Are Not Shared, the Soviet Union Has the Right to Steal Them Through Espionage for Self-Defense</h3>
<p>[United Press, Havana Dispatch of the 18th] Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davies, told the United Press reporter here alone today that if the Soviet Union is denied the sharing of atomic bomb secrets by its former allies who fought side by side, then for self-defense, it is morally justified in stealing them through military espionage. The U.S. and British policy of strict denial, judging by its meaning, is no less than a hostile act. Major powers deploying intelligence networks to spy on other countries' military intelligence has not started today. The U.S. and Britain do not want the Russians to know the atomic secrets, almost treating the Russians like children. In fact, the Soviet Union has no shortage of talented scientists who can develop atomic tactics in their own laboratories within two years. For the present, if we do not achieve mutual trust and cooperation among the major powers, then we can only repeat the old tricks of power politics. The two cannot be combined. The Soviet Union now needs peace to recuperate. The current chaotic suspicions among the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union should be swept away. Without this, we can only engage in large-scale competition, rush to build arsenals and scientific laboratories, and end up in a great war of total destruction. The Soviet Union today is afraid of British imperialism, just as Britain is afraid of the Soviet Union's ambition for its lifeline in the eastern Mediterranean, oil fields, and interests in India and China. The diplomatic chess game is full of intrigue, with each move tightly contested. When will this open and secret struggle between the three powers end?</p>
<h3>Japanese Battleship Nagato to be Used for Atomic Bomb Tests</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nagato Bay, Tokyo Dispatch of the 19th] The former flagship Nagato, which the Japanese Navy originally took pride in, is now battered by repeated air raids and in disrepair, no longer possessing its former grandeur. The ship will set sail again soon, but this time it will be flying the American flag, and its mission will be to test the power of atomic bombs. In addition, the Japanese light cruiser Sakawa is also raising steam and is ready to depart to Bikini Atoll for atomic bomb testing.</p>
<h3>Withdrawal Plans for British and French Troops in Syria and Lebanon to Proceed Soon Through Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London Dispatch of the 19th] Since the British and French military representatives began negotiations in Beirut last December on the withdrawal of British and French troops from the Levant region, they have been deadlocked. However, they received the same instructions from the British and French governments yesterday, and the deadlock can be broken. This is the result of British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault resolving to re-establish the opinion of the majority of the members of the United Nations Security Council last Saturday in favor of continuing negotiations on troop withdrawal. The British and French military representatives in Beirut have received this instruction. Now that the deadlock has been broken, the next stage will be to hold consultations with the Syrian and Lebanese authorities to agree on a plan for troop withdrawal.</p>
<h3>Iranian Delegation Arrives in Soviet Union; Molotov Personally Welcomes Them at the Airport</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's News] London Broadcast of the 19th stated that the Iranian delegation arrived in Moscow today, and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov personally welcomed them at the airport.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran Dispatch of the 19th] Iranian Prime Minister Saed, along with the Iranian mission, flew to Moscow yesterday morning. Three members of the mission, including Datari, General Firooz, and Deputy Minister of Commerce Volfsi, have not yet departed. When the mission took off, Soviet Embassy personnel greeted them at the airport.</p>
<h3>Can Underground Cities Prevent Atomic Bombs?</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington Dispatch of the 18th] Hutchins, a professor at the University of Chicago who contributed greatly to the invention of the atomic bomb, reported to the House Armed Services Committee today that the atomic bomb is only the beginning of weapons of terror, and we will have even more terrible bombs in the future. We need peace, or we will invite our own destruction. The only way to solve this problem now is to organize a "world government." The world-renowned mathematician and inventor of relativity, Professor Einstein, once said that if an atomic war breaks out, two-thirds of the U.S. population will be wiped out. This is indeed an exaggeration. The only effective defense method is to build an underground city that is 50 miles long, 1.5 miles wide, and 800 yards deep.</p>
<h3>World Trade Conference to be Held in the Second Half of the Year</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London Dispatch of the 18th] The United Nations Economic and Social Council announced its adjournment today, pending its reconvening at a temporary site in New York on May 25.

The foreign ministers' representatives held two meetings this morning and afternoon to discuss the organization of the investigation team so that the team could depart as soon as possible.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's News] London Broadcast of the 19th stated that the British mission, which is flying to India with an extremely important mission, includes three key members of the British Cabinet: (1) Secretary of State for India, Lawrence, (2) Minister of Commerce, Cripps, (3) Sea Minister, Alexander. It is heard that the mission is equivalent to the British Cabinet stationed in India, and its powers and tasks are extremely important.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay Dispatch of the 19th] The Bombay government issued a statement today stating that the disturbances at the Royal Indian Navy's Talwar Camp (naval facilities) have spread to other naval facilities today. A large number of strikers poured into the streets and engaged in hostile acts. In the morning, the strikers seized several Indian Navy trucks and drove them recklessly in the streets, shouting slogans and ordering shopkeepers to close their shops. Before noon, most of the marchers had been dispersed and returned to their barracks. The police were attacked by strikers with iron rods and wooden sticks, and three people were injured. Most of the strikers demanded the release of Captain Rashid, an officer of the "Indian National Army" under the protection of the Japanese, who has been sentenced to seven years in prison. The riots in Calcutta four days ago were also caused by this. After today's disturbances, the strikers returned to Talwar Camp, and their leader said, "Today's holiday has passed. The message we give to the British government is to get out of India."</p>
<h3>International Judges Appointed to Try Major Japanese War Criminals; Occupation Courts Established in Japan; New Zealand Troops Leave Italy for Japan</h3>

All of these are not prohibited by Japanese law. Nationals of the Allied countries will also be judged by these courts in the future. Each court also has the power to impose the death penalty, but it must be approved by MacArthur.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Wellington Dispatch of the 19th] The main force of the New Zealand Brigade of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan is scheduled to depart from Italy today and arrive in Japan on March 28.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Wanting To Return From Japan Must Register</h3>

<h3>After the Yalta Agreement Announcement: The Permanent Peace of the Far East Falls into the Mist, The Three Eastern Provinces Still Occupied Like a Cuckoo in a Sparrow's Nest, The Fruits of Our Victory Are Stolen</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] The announcement of the Yalta Secret Agreement has aroused indignation in China, and the hope for permanent peace in the Far East has once again fallen into a heavy fog. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty recognizes the independence of Outer Mongolia and agrees to grant the Soviet Union various economic rights in the Three Eastern Provinces. The Chinese people will also view this as a result of coercion by Britain and the United States to allow the Soviet Union to participate in the Pacific War. China's resentment towards the United States may dissipate because of the hope for post-war assistance in large-scale construction. However, it is not yet clear how its attitude towards the Soviet Union will change. China has little concern for the Kuril Islands, but what was signed away in the Sino-Soviet Treaty is the lifeblood. The independence of Outer Mongolia has been rejected by China for many years. The Sino-Japanese War began in the Three Eastern Provinces, with the intention of driving Japan out of Northeast China, but as a result of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, Japan has left, and the Soviet Union has come. The Three Eastern Provinces are still occupied like a cuckoo in a sparrow's nest. The current sentiment prevailing in China is that the Soviet Union is trying to obtain rights beyond the treaty. There have been mass demonstrations in Chongqing demanding that the Soviet Union withdraw from the Three Eastern Provinces, that the content of Sino-Soviet negotiations be made public, and that the Soviet Union abide by the treaty. In China, demonstrations often start with insignificant people, on a small scale, but sometimes grasp the public's psychology, spread rapidly, and turn into a nationwide movement, not only involving China in the war, but also inevitably involving countries far across the West Pacific. After World War I, China discovered that there were secret agreements between the powers to cede Jiaozhou Bay to Japan, so as to induce Japan to withdraw and confront Germany, so that Japan could further strengthen its position in Northeast China. The Yalta Agreement is similar, and China has once again discovered that part of the fruits of its victory have been stolen.</p>
<h3>Mummy From 6,000 Years Ago</h3>

<h3>French-Vietnamese Negotiations Underway; If They Fail, France Prepares to Use Force</h3>
<p>[United Press, Saigon, 18th] Responsible parties announced today that the French Special Envoy to Northern Vietnam, Sainteny, and the President of the Independent Republic of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh, have held several long negotiations in Hanoi. Judging from various signs, if the negotiations fail, the French army is prepared to use force to crush the resistance of the Annamese people. 4,000 troops from the French colonial forces have arrived in Laos. Reinforcements, including tanks and infantry, are also arriving in West Siam. At least three regiments of Vietnamese troops originally stationed in France will arrive as reinforcements within two weeks.</p>

<h3>Vatican Ceremony</h3>
<p>Thomas Tien Ken-sin Installed as Cardinal</p>
<p>[United Press, Vatican, 18th] The Holy See held a ceremony today for the installation of 32 cardinals.

<p>Old Case of Conspiracy to Murder Husband Reopened</p>
<p>Zhang, the wife of Weng Huanting, a resident of Xupu Township in Punnan, cohabited with Wang Boyu. Because Boyu blinded Huanting, and their adulterous affair had been discovered, he conspired with Li A'si to kill Huanting at an opportune moment. A'si pretended to be a robber, breaking into Huanting's house, tying up the people, and searching the place, intending to make the family of the deceased believe that Huanting's death was at the hands of robbers. This incident occurred in April of the 33rd year [of the Republic]. At that time, Boyu had considerable influence, so he was not reported. Now that victory has arrived, the local Self-Defense Corps arrested Wang Boyu and Li A'si on the 8th of this month. After interrogation, they confessed and have been sent to the county to be dealt with according to the law. Weng Xiding, the brother of the deceased, has also filed a lawsuit with the prosecutor's office, requesting an investigation.</p>

<p>Strike Triggered by Allegations of Extortion</p>
<p>Qingyang Town, which belongs to Cheng County and borders Wuxi, was the site of a gambling den operating during the Lantern Festival evening at the Zhenxin Teahouse. A patrol team from the police station passed by, and instead of prohibiting the gambling operation, the police entered to drink tea. When the patrol reached the Jia Family Ancestral Hall on South Street, residents Xia Liang and Xia Boshou were playing with dragon cards at home. Without asking the reason, the police took them away and searched Xia Liang's pocket, confiscating 1,000 Customs Gold Units. When the police passed by the Zhenxin Teahouse, the gambling was still continuing. Xia Liang and others felt aggrieved and argued with the police, who then released Xia Liang and the other. However, the next morning, Xia Liang and Xia Boshou were arrested again, which aroused the public anger of the townspeople. All the shops in the town went on strike on the 17th. A petition was sent to the Sixth District Office, and the district chief, Xu Zukun, advised them to open the shops first and wait for a legal resolution. The merchants and residents refused to open their shops, vowing not to resume business until the police chief was dismissed and investigated.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency] The Jiangsu Provincial Government reported that the Jiangnan Seawall and the Jiangbei Canal embankment were severely damaged, with gaps and holes, posing extreme danger. As the spring flood season is approaching, measures should be taken to prevent problems before they occur. Engineering bureaus have been established to send engineering personnel to conduct surveying, design, and estimation work. Plans to repair the Jiangnan Seawall and plans to dredge the Jiangbei Canal waterway have been drafted and telegraphed to the Executive Yuan requesting appropriation of funds for timely repairs to ensure the lives and property of millions of people.

<p>Sheng County</p>
<p>Township and Deputy Chiefs Accused of Colluding with the Enemy</p>
<p>Qiu Zhu, the township chief of Chongren Town in Sheng County, Zhejiang, and Deputy Chief Qiu Wan Guanqin, etc., are local tyrants and gentry. In the 16th year of the Republic [1927], they instructed local teams to destroy the county and district Kuomintang offices, a matter on record. Since the fall of eastern Zhejiang and the occupation of Shengcheng by Japanese troops, the Kuomintang party, government, and military were forced to withdraw westward. The township chief took advantage of the opportunity to collude with the enemy and puppets to exploit the villagers. At that time, due to the environment, government orders were difficult to implement. After the surrender of Japan, the National Government explicitly exempted land taxes, and the provincial government also suspended borrowing. However, the township and deputy chiefs still extorted funds. Qiu Zhemin and other fellow villagers in Shanghai jointly filed a factual complaint, listing 14 counts of their crimes. It is reported that the Zhejiang Supervisory Commissioner's Office has sent personnel to investigate and report to the Supervisory Yuan for verification and handling. Chairman Huang has also instructed the Civil Affairs Department to instruct the Sheng County Government to investigate and handle the matter.</p>

<h3>Eradicating the Remaining Mist of Nazism, Overcoming National Weaknesses, Rebuilding Berlin</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xu Chengbin stationed in Britain</p>
<p>The Berlin City Government, under the supervision of the four Allied military administrations, recently held an exhibition to report on its work progress over the past six months. In terms of figures, the situation in Berlin has gradually returned to normal. As Eisenhower said, no one knew how to begin rebuilding Berlin. The destruction was thorough and unprecedented. In London and Chongqing, we can occasionally see the remains of air raids on standing houses, but in Berlin, you first see a ruin, and then, by the side of the street, you might find a house with its roof gone but its foundation still standing. Today, residents live in those houses that were not completely destroyed by the bombardment. A tarpaulin, a few piles of straw, meet the most pressing needs. The silence in the streets matches the name of a dead city. Occasionally, you see an old man pushing a cart of firewood home, but there is no other sign of life.</p>
<p>However, with the help of the Allied forces and the relief from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Berlin has overcome several unbelievable difficulties. Although there is a shortage of essential goods, there is no panic. At the very least, life can still be sustained. Apart from the constant influx of refugees, the housing problem has been temporarily resolved. Houses that have not suffered much damage are being repaired. If there were not a shortage of materials, the progress could be more satisfactory. Gas and electricity have been restored, but are under strict control. Coal is absolutely unavailable. Everyone is looking for wood to burn for warmth. Food distribution is based on work ability. Those who do not work do not get anything. In the past two months, the British, American, Soviet, and French authorities have been able to distribute according to the planned program and moderately increase the quality of the lowest level of distribution. The situation after the spring may improve further.</p>
<p>Social life is also gradually returning to normal. The subway, buses, and trams have mostly been restored. Schools have purged the remnants of Nazism, revised textbooks, and have reopened. The list of university faculty members has been finalized, and students can enroll after their qualifications have been reviewed.</p>
<p>Learning Labor Skills, Planning Small-Scale Production</p>
<p>Out of the three million residents, one million are working under the guidance of the city government. The number of idle people is 500,000, but most of them are old and weak and unable to work. Therefore, the percentage of working people to the total population is extremely high. Officials who used to work in companies and institutions now have to change careers. Training technicians and redefining the scope of professions have become a temporary necessity. When companies and institutions will be revived is unknown. The most urgent need is to fundamentally rebuild society, learn labor skills, and plan small-scale production.</p>
<p>Regulations Mandate Food for Workers, Arresting Black Market Merchants</p>
<p>Berlin's laws stipulate that "those who work shall eat," but there are still people who do not work. Many people accumulated money during the war, and those who have money can buy things. Most of these people with capital buy food and daily necessities on the black market. The Allied authorities are doing their best to arrest black market merchants and cannot say that they have not achieved anything. However, since Germany is divided into four zones, and the regulations in the four zones are not unified, and the police system is not complete, violations are difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>This is the outer appearance of Berlin life. From the armistice to today, from complete chaos to today's order, it has not been an easy period. This achievement depends on the cooperation between the Allied forces and the German people. The Allied forces issue orders and supply materials; the German people execute the orders and work hard. Their strong obedience and high work efficiency have reduced many difficulties. They know that to improve their current living conditions, they have to rely on their own efforts.</p>
<p>The Difficult Winter Has Passed, The Road Ahead Is Still Thorny</p>
<p>Winter was a difficult hurdle. The mortality rate among the old and young has been very high. The cold weather made life an even more serious problem. Due to effective prevention, infectious diseases have not spread widely, but long-term malnutrition and disease have become common phenomena.</p>
<p>In short, the Germans are doing their best to struggle. They do not have feelings of self-pity. Their characteristic is a sense of responsibility. The Germans feel that the initiators of the war were the Nazi Party, and they were only obeying military orders, so they cannot be considered criminals. This is the weakness that the German nation is still displaying. They cannot see their fundamental mistakes, and they need re-education.</p>
<p>Naturally, they also need daily necessities. Starving people do not have the mood to talk about democracy and freedom. (8th)</p>
<h3>Ties Must Not Be Swapped</h3>
<p>There is an American saying: "Ties must not be swapped." This is how the Allied forces are dealing with German war criminals and their civilians in Germany: war criminals are punished with deserved sentences, while the civilians are given thorough re-education. The targets are different, and the methods of dealing with them also differ. "Ties must not be swapped," this is what it means.</p>
<h3>Europe's Largest Airport to Appear</h3>
<p>This newspaper's London Aviation News</p>
<p>British Commercial Aviation has announced plans to build Europe's largest airport. According to the plan, Heathrow Airport, currently under construction outside London, will be expanded by more than two times. It will occupy 4,000 acres, with a runway 15,000 feet long, and two additional runways of 90 feet and 6,000 feet long. If necessary, more can be added. The new airport will be equipped with the latest equipment, and transportation between the airport and various parts of Britain is also under study.</p>
<p>The plan will be submitted to the Parliament for review and is expected to be approved. Before the new airport can be built, some highways must be diverted, and some villages must be demolished. The purchase of private land and price negotiations will also be complicated.</p>
<p>Currently, the world's largest commercial airport is New York's Idlewild Airport. The airport is also under expansion, and the final area will reach [blank], already in sight. (Xu Chengbin)</p>
<h3>A Few Opinions on Salt Administration Reform (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xu Erxin</p>
<p>The salt administration system in our country has evolved through successive dynasties, each with its unique characteristics. Books and records describe it in great detail, but it can generally be divided into three types: tax-free system, taxation system, and exclusive purchase system. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, it has inherited the flawed policies of the late Qing Dynasty, continuing without change, resulting in deeply ingrained malpractices. In most areas, it remains a system where merchants are invited to bid for coastal areas, transport salt after paying taxes, or where merchants contract to handle salt and pay taxes as a form of commercial monopoly. However, in areas where merchants fail to deliver salt, or where illegal salt from nearby fields is rampant and the authorities cannot compete with private operations, government management is adopted. After a short period, its abolition is discussed, or freedom is restored, or even reverted to commercial management. Reforms are inconsistent, and right and wrong are confused, with no fixed system to speak of.</p>
<p>Since the national government established its capital in Nanjing, it has strived for reform. In March of the 20th year, the Legislative Yuan formulated the Salt Law, consisting of seven chapters and thirty-nine articles, adopting a system of taxation at the production site, allowing people to freely buy and sell salt. This is undoubtedly a relatively complete salt system. However, our country has a vast territory, and the situations in various regions are complex and unique. Salt production areas are spread across the country, with sea salt, well salt, pond salt, and rock salt all available. Production methods include sun-drying, boiling, or natural crystallization, all depending on the location, making the industry scattered and different from other countries. In these circumstances, the management of production sites is extremely difficult. Before production site management becomes truly strict, this system of taxation at the production site and free trade is significantly hindered by the current salt affairs situation in our country. If enforced forcibly, illegal salt will inevitably flood the market, severely affecting tax revenue. The detailed reasons are discussed in my book "Discussion on Salt Monopoly" (published in the Hong Kong "Financial Review," Volume 5, Number 5). As the victory in the War of Resistance is celebrated and national reconstruction work urgently needs to be carried out, rectifying tax revenue and enriching finances are of the utmost importance. Therefore, I dare to express my humble opinions based on years of research on salt affairs, hoping to provide references and contribute to joint discussions.</p>
<p>Taxation at the Production Site</p>
<p>In the system of allowing people to freely buy and sell, the government's sole purpose is taxation. Although the procedure is simplified and easy to implement, it is feared that it is not applicable to a country with complex situations like ours. Salt, being a necessity for people's food, cannot be absent even for a day and can also be used for agriculture, industry, medicine, and military affairs. Its importance is no less than that of grain. The government should not only aim to tax it for financial purposes but should also consider regulating food supply, balancing supply and demand (because salt is not like rice and wheat, which have other food substitutes), and increasing production to meet the needs of various industries during the reconstruction period and avoid shortages. In the past era of commercial contracting, merchants were profit-oriented. They often regarded remote areas with difficult transportation as undesirable and were unwilling to transport salt there. These areas often faced the fear of salt shortages. Even those who ventured to transport salt there, because of the high risks and costs, would inevitably hoard and raise prices, or adulterate the salt with mud and sand, resulting in poor quality. However, because salt sales in various regions were allocated according to population with fixed annual quotas, the government still adopted a management system. If merchants did not go, the government would transport salt to meet the people's needs. Once a system of taxation at the production site is adopted, allowing people to freely buy and sell, and the government does not intervene, remote areas will be neglected by merchants and not supplied by the government. Salt, unlike other commodities, has no substitutes. Daily shortages will inevitably cause serious panic about salt shortages. Furthermore, the methods of salt production in our country, whether sun-drying or boiling, have different complexities and advantages, or natural production without human intervention, resulting in different costs. Merchants are profit-driven, and salt produced in areas with higher costs will likely find no buyers, resulting in production without sales. Salt farmers rely on salt production for a living and cannot easily change careers. If the salt they produce is neither bought by merchants nor collected by the government, resulting in a breakdown in sales channels, it will inevitably lead to a serious panic about their livelihoods. Without finding ways to smuggle salt, they will be unable to sustain their lives. Even with strict laws and severe punishments, it will be impossible to stop them.</p>
<p>Government Monopoly System</p>
<p>I believe that the most suitable salt system for our country is to refer to the successful rules of past dynasties, consider the trends of the world, and adopt a government monopoly system. The so-called government monopoly method is based on private production with government production as a supplement, government purchase, transportation, and sales as the main focus, and commercial sales as a supplement. The reasons for this are explained separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Our country's salt production is extremely rich, and a large number of people rely on salt production for their livelihoods. Before the government has an overall plan, it can only allow them to continue production, providing guidance on how to improve production methods to achieve refinement. However, this type of privately produced salt is often unclean, containing other components, and of extremely poor quality, which has long been criticized by foreigners. Besides private production, the government should consider establishing salt production companies and can also absorb social capital, jointly operated by government and business, using machinery to produce salt, or encourage salt farmers to raise funds themselves to establish companies to manufacture with machinery, in order to demonstrate improvement and meet the needs of both domestic and foreign markets.</p>
<p>(2) The government purchase of field salt has been the most complete method in the salt system of our country's past dynasties. The benefits of government purchase include: (1) Salt farmers can concentrate on production, as their income is secure. (2) The salt produced by salt farmers is collected as soon as it is produced, without any stagnation, which is beneficial (in the past, salt collection had fixed quotas, and production was limited, so salt farmers often smuggled surplus salt, or merchants privately collected surplus salt, smuggled it, or officials who were not honest bought surplus salt for profit). Salt farmers voluntarily hand over all salt to the government, unwilling to smuggle it, and field smuggling can be fundamentally eliminated. (3) All salt farmers must hand over their salt to the government and do not contact merchants, thus reducing the opportunity for smuggling. The malpractice of unscrupulous merchants distributing and transporting salt with heavy weights is avoided.</p>
<p>(3) Our country's salt system has always emphasized government transportation. The Tang Dynasty had the system of "gang transport," and the Song Dynasty implemented official transportation. During the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, government transportation was generally used in remote areas where transportation was difficult and merchants did not go, or in areas near the fields where illegal salt was rampant, to continue their poverty relief. The government transportation system was originally the most ideal method to</p>
<p>Prevent Smuggling</p>
<p>However, during the Song Dynasty, conscripting laborers and villagers for transportation caused them to lose their lives and fortunes, causing significant disturbances. And since the Republic of China, the government has not actually implemented official transportation. Most of it is still contracted out to merchants, which is the same as contracting. Those who set up bureaus to handle transportation hired relatives and friends, sharing profits and selling private salt, resulting in extremely corrupt operations. All of this is due to improper implementation. It should not be said that the official transportation system itself is bad, and we cannot abandon it because of this. After salt is transported by the government, the past malpractices of "stealing," "concealing," "pouring," "selling," and "using salt to transport salt" can be eliminated.</p>
<p>(4) Salt is transported from the production area to each sales outlet, or stored in warehouses at a suitable location with convenient transportation at the sales outlet. It is then sold wholesale by the government to licensed merchants, who resell it within a specified range. Consumers can buy from licensed merchants. With the government coordinating distribution and sales, it can both collect the profits of government sales and not deprive merchants of their profits. Consumers can buy freely, with no fear of salt shortages or high prices.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned government monopoly of government production, purchase, transportation, and sales should be regarded as an enterprise, correcting the malpractices of the past "government-run" system. Talented people who are good at running businesses should be selected to take charge. A state-owned salt industry company should be established to use business management techniques to plan the nationwide salt monopoly. From production and purchase to transportation and sales, all business operations should be the</p>
<p>Salt Industry Company</p>
<p>Responsible for handling. Salt affairs administrative organs should be in a position of supervision and guidance, without being responsible for operations themselves, which is completely different from the so-called "government-run" and "government transportation" in the past. The monopoly system has been extremely popular in recent times, but our country was the earliest to advocate it. The object of the monopoly was salt. During the Spring and Autumn period, Guan Zhong implemented a salt monopoly in Qi. The methods of monopoly varied slightly through the Han, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, and since the early Republic of China, it has been changed to commercial monopoly. All salt purchases and movements are handled by merchants authorized by the government, who collect taxes in between, and the profits go to wealthy merchants. Salt has a wide range of uses and is essential for people. Although the government advocates free trade, in nearby areas or places with convenient transportation, people may still be able to operate freely. In sales outlets or remote areas, small merchants are often merged by large merchants. Only merchants with strong financial resources can operate. These merchants tend to manipulate the market and monopolize profits. Therefore, the operation of the salt industry inherently has a monopoly nature. It will either be a government monopoly or a commercial monopoly. According to our country's historical records, the facts are clearly verifiable. This so-called government monopoly system is that the state-owned salt industry company is responsible for all operations. Its organization and business are no different from a privately operated enterprise company, that is,</p>
<p>Achieving the purpose of government monopoly through private operation methods. However, the capital is allocated by the state treasury (but commercial shares can also be collected appropriately), and the income from the company's operations is entirely attributed to the state treasury (if commercial shares are collected, dividends are distributed according to shares). It is no different from taking the past</p>
<p>Merchant Monopoly</p>
<p>The rights are transferred to the state for its own operation, and its income is used to supplement the state treasury, taken from the people and still used for the people, which can be said to have the advantages of a commercial monopoly without the disadvantages of a government monopoly. Since salt is monopolized by the government, the government can naturally take care of the livelihood of salt farmers. The government can calculate the cost of production and give them legitimate profits as a standard for determining the purchase price. Since the purchase price is not too low, salt farmers' production will naturally be profitable. At ordinary times, the government can also provide loans to salt farmers, such as the advance of funds in the past by salt merchants, and fund the maintenance of the furnaces, and can guide salt farmers to set up various cooperatives to reduce the burden on salt farmers. The people will naturally be unwilling to leak private salt. At the same time, the government can also assess the purchasing power of consumers, and the price will not be too high. It only needs to view the salt's transportation from the place of production, calculate its cost, transportation costs, taxes, and the legitimate profits of the merchants to determine the selling price of the salt. This price, without the encroachment of past salt merchants, and the various fees paid to the coastal ports, has lower costs and therefore lower selling prices. Consumers have a lighter burden and are naturally unwilling to eat private salt. It can be said to have the advantages of government monopoly without the malpractices of commercial monopoly. I deeply believe that the current county administration reform, this system, etc., conforms to the principles of planned economy, which is relatively complete and easy to implement.</p>
<h3>Reader's Opinion: Writers After Victory</h3>
<p>— Han Qiu</p>
<p>Victory is the ardent hope of the people of the entire country. With victory, the people should celebrate, and writers should write more articles about victory. Victory is the merit of the soldiers in the War of Resistance, and the common people should respect and love them, and writers should write more articles praising them. However, the psychological contrast of the Chinese people is difficult to fathom. Before victory, they longed for victory and had been looking forward to it for eight years. After victory, however, they became pessimistic, feeling that the future held little hope. Writers seem only to know how to criticize the world and are not accustomed to supporting the cause. They do not think about how the national army can be compared with the puppet army? The national army fought to the death in the War of Resistance, while the puppet army sought only to live in peace. At the same time, poor clothing does not mean that one cannot win battles. The country is poor, and the national army does not have camp equipment. If there are no barracks in the area, can they camp out in the open? To say that the national army rapes women is a fabrication. (Among the enemies, only bandits rape women.) During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the National Revolutionary Army did not have such things happen. With victory, how can they still smear their own faces? The person who wrote such an article simply has a nerve problem with his pen and is so sorry to the soldiers who fought in the War of Resistance for eight years! (Written on the night of February 1, 1946, at Jiawang Coal Mine on the Jinpu Railway.)</p>
<h3>Editorial: Congratulating Our Country's First Cardinal</h3>
<p>Pope Pius XII of Rome announced at a secret meeting of the "Episcopal Conference" on the 18th that he would elevate 31 bishops to the rank of cardinal, including the Apostolic Vicar of Qingdao, China. The Pope also issued a decree, stating: "The appointment of new cardinal bishops has long been in my mind, but I was prevented from realizing it due to the war. Now that the war is finally over, we can implement the planned plan. The universality of the Church has now been increased with new glory. The Church does not belong to any one race, one people, or one country, but to the masses of the human family." According to a Reuters dispatch from Rome on the same day, "Behind the solid medieval walls of the Vatican, the Holy See is about to hold a series of meetings that are full of repentance to symbolize the renewed vitality of the Catholic Church in a world troubled by war. According to Vatican merchants, the collective gathering of cardinals in Rome this time, as in the human history of the past, is a turning point in history; and at every turning point in history, the Catholic Church must show its eternal creative vitality. The number of cardinals meeting at the Vatican this week is unprecedented; and the number of 32 cardinals appointed by the Pope this time is also unprecedented in the history of the Catholic Church." The dispatch also stated: "The presence of the first Chinese Cardinal in the Sacred College of Cardinals is enough to show that the Pope's ideas are not limited by narrow European traditions." In today's world, even though World War II has ended, there are still strong powers scheming to undermine world peace. The solemn meeting being held in the Vatican gives us a sense of coolness and warmth, allowing our troubled minds to find peace and tranquility. The radiance emitted from St. Peter's Basilica today, as in the long history of mankind in the past, illuminates the hearts of people all over the world.</p>
<p>This gathering at the Vatican has a very profound historical meaning. The extraordinary meeting has been convened after mankind has endured an unprecedented catastrophe, and the cardinals who participated in the meeting came from distant parts of the world. This not only shows the "holy and universal" universality of the Catholic Church but also is enough to show that the Catholic Church transcends the mortal world and is eternally new. It is not frustrated by the difficulties of the times but instead thrives in adversity, further increasing its dynamic and vibrant power. Today, although the fires of war have subsided, there are still broken walls and rubble everywhere. Mankind has just come through a brutal war, and it is not the world peace conference or the international conferences where politicians are scheming and fighting that makes them realize the wholeness of humanity, but the meeting being held behind the medieval walls of the Vatican. There is true peace there, and there is a representation of the wholeness of humanity and the unification of the world. The fact that the Catholic Church can express the spirit of the wholeness of humanity and the unification of the world at this time is enough to show the abundant power of the Catholic Church itself.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the Chinese people, in this historically significant meeting, our country's first cardinal, Bishop Tian Gengxin, participated. This is a creation in the history of the Catholic Church, which is particularly meaningful. Before the newspaper learned that our country had selected a cardinal bishop, it had written an article, believing that "the Pope's appointment of Bishop Tian Gengxin as cardinal shows how much the Pope cares about the church affairs in China," and said: "Now that the Pope cares extremely about the church affairs in China, and our government also maintains the missionary work of Christianity with utmost care, I sincerely hope that Catholicism can continue to develop in our country and that China can gradually become a family of Christians, living up to the expectations of the Pope and our Chairman." "Judging from the election of Bishop Tian Gengxin as a cardinal, it can be seen that the Catholic Church in China has gradually reached adulthood. We will not forget that during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the spread of Catholicism had a positive impact on our culture. I sincerely hope that Chinese Catholics... can make outstanding contributions in the work of building a new China and a new world." Cardinal Tian is modest, pure in character, and has mature wisdom and integrity; this promotion to cardinal is a personal honor, but the fact that China can participate in the confidential affairs of the central authorities of the Holy See because of Cardinal Tian's election is a credit to China. At the same time, the election of a Chinese person as a cardinal is enough to show the universality of the Holy Church and is also a credit to the Church. Our Chairman Chiang cares very much about the work of the Christian Church in China. This time, Mr. Tian was elected as a cardinal, and it was proposed to send a special plane to greet him and bring him to Chongqing, which shows how much our government, including the Chairman, expects of Cardinal Tian. Chinese Catholics should be inspired by the election of Cardinal Tian, who is unanimously admired as a leader in spirit, and should take on the responsibilities that they should assume in the cause of national construction.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang came to Shanghai this time. In his address to the people at the mass welcome meeting in the racetrack, he asked us to learn the moral spirit of foreign countries. The newspaper wrote an article on the 12th anniversary of the New Life Movement, elaborating on this point, and said: "In the Chairman's speech at the racecourse, he taught us to learn their moral spirit... The moral spirit of the West, including the Soviet Union, is deeply rooted in Christianity. In addition to moral rules, they also have religious rules to regulate their behavior. The New Life Movement takes the restoration of inherent morality as its main task, and perhaps a new driving force is needed in its implementation. The inherent morality of our country and the moral rules of Christianity can be said to be one and the same; if we want to thoroughly learn the moral spirit of the West, we must also pay more attention to the Christian rules of Western civilization." What is the new driving force that may be needed to promote the New Life Movement? It is probably Christianity, especially Catholicism in Christianity. Catholicism has strict rules, a close-knit organization, and is spread throughout the country. Its missionaries are content with poverty and abandon the comfortable worldly life to go to poor and remote areas to serve the Lord until the end, which is the highest expression of the moral spirit of the West. If the New Life Movement is to achieve its effectiveness, it must be added with a religious baptism; with a religious enthusiasm, the personal life can be thoroughly reformed. The New Life Movement is to restore our country's inherent morality so that individuals can be responsible and disciplined in their lives. Our country's inherent morality is also the moral values cherished by Christians, and being responsible and disciplined is the consistent spirit of Catholics. The New Life Movement is the basic work of national construction, and in this basic work, we need the cooperation of Catholics.</p>
<p>Catholicism is not a religion that is detached from the world; if it were detached from the world, it would not be a religion. Catholicism has what is called the Triumphant Church, the Militant Church, and the Suffering Church. Catholics in the present world belong to the so-called Militant Church and must constantly fight against the enemy. Therefore, the Catholic view of life is a fighting view of life, which must be defended and fought at all times. This kind of battle is widespread in all aspects, so it also has immutable principles for the reconstruction of social order. The late Popes Leo XIII and Pius XI issued encyclicals on social and economic issues, providing the most detailed and concrete plans for the reconstruction of social order, establishing a complete system of Catholic social economy, characterized by moderation and peace, and starting from "charity" to seek the welfare of all people. This Catholic system is secretly in line with the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, the highest principle of national construction in our country, but the efforts of Chinese Catholics on how to implement Catholic social and economic policies in China still seem to be insufficient. At this time of national construction, Chinese Catholics should make more contributions in this area.</p>
<p>Shen Bao is a public instrument of the people of the whole country. Because Bishop Tian Gengxin has been appointed as a cardinal and is participating in the historically significant meeting being held in the Vatican, I would like to express a few words to congratulate him.</p>

<h3>Eradicating Illegal Speculation in the City Market: Merchants Decide on Four Measures: 2,000 Telephones Will Be Removed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were few shadows in the securities building. Yesterday, there were few shadows in the securities building.</p>
<p>The financial authorities were extremely indignant that a group of incorrigible people gathered in the securities building to engage in speculative trading, creating a black market horror. Financial Commissioner Chen Hang especially invited the municipal government and security authorities to a meeting at the municipal government yesterday to discuss effective measures to thoroughly eliminate it. It is reported that it has been decided that (1) they will be ordered to suspend business, (2) the liquidation will be carried out by the Securities Exchange Council, and this kind of thing will not be allowed to happen again, (3) the telephones will be removed, and (4) the police will be dispatched at any time to patrol, and if any gathering of buying and selling is discovered, it will be prohibited. In the future, if any relocation of business is found, it should be dealt with accordingly. Other matters, such as the Central Market and money exchange shops and banks, if there are illegal actions, the social security aspects will jointly be responsible for strictly sanctioning them.</p>
<p>It is said that the so-called brokerage firm in the securities building has reached more than 100, and there are about 2,000 telephones, and the most one has reached a dozen, which is really shocking.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the reporter made a special trip to inspect the securities building on each floor. The scene was quiet, and the shadow was as desolate as on a holiday. The merchants and other partners gathered to gamble and do other things. The counters were densely arranged, and the telephones were silent. The blackboard was silent, black and white. This time, the ban on the black market has suffered losses and is still sporadic. They only have a small amount of capital, and the loan is borrowed and cannot be sold, so the impact is unaffected.</p>

So he bought back pork and vegetables and waited for Matsuzaki to return. When Matsuzaki returned, they drank together. During their conversation, the matter of the lost items was brought up. Takagi Tadashi suddenly strangled Matsuzaki with both hands and used a white cloth to strangle him to death. After the incident, Takagi took bedding, wicker baskets, leather shoes, and 1.8 million in counterfeit currency from Matsuzaki's house and hired a car to take them to his friend Harada's place. Then he returned to the scene, moved the body, and dumped it in the wasteland behind No. 19, Lane 416, Zhoujiazui Road.

<h3>Wage Issues of Newspaper Employees Awaiting Assessment by the Social Bureau</h3>
<p>Shanghai newspaper employees previously submitted written suggestions to the management regarding the issue of raising wages, using the rise and fall of the cost of living index as the standard and calculating with 55 yuan as the base salary. Because negotiations between labor and management were unsuccessful, the labor side applied to the Social Bureau for mediation. The Social Bureau convened a mediation meeting between labor and management at 2:00 PM on the two previous days. Labor and management failed to reach an agreement, and the mediation was declared unsuccessful. The Social Bureau will make an impartial assessment and deliver it to both labor and management this afternoon. It remains to be seen whether both labor and management can abide by the results of the assessment.</p>
<h3>Continued Trial of the Case of Killing American Pilots; Fierce Debate Between Both Sides; Testimony of Kaburaki Highly Deceptive</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The trial of the war criminal killing of the American pilots in Hankou continued yesterday morning on the 18th. The debate between the plaintiff and defendant was still quite intense. It is estimated that a verdict will be reached today, which is highly unlikely. According to Major Li Wen, the defense attorney for the defendant, the defendant's side has not finished its arguments, and the date of the verdict is still early.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the hearing yesterday morning, Lieutenant Colonel Harkins, the defense attorney for the defendant, protested against the plaintiff's attorney cross-examining the written statement made by the defendant, arguing that this violated basic legal principles. Lieutenant Colonel West, the plaintiff's attorney, retorted that the statement made by the defendant was clearly inconsistent with the facts and could not be used as evidence to exonerate him. As for saying that this violated basic legal principles, that was unheard of.</p>
<p>The court immediately adjourned for consultation and rejected the protest raised by the defendant's attorney as a result. Then, Major General Kaburaki Masataka, Chief of Staff of the 34th Army of Japan, was interrogated. Lieutenant Colonel West asked if he knew that the Japanese military police participated in the parade of the three American pilots, which was one of the tasks of the 34th Army. Had he received a report from Lieutenant Izumi, who carried out the parade, regarding this matter? Did he remember that American planes distributed leaflets stating that prisoners of war should not be abused? Did he receive a report from Izumi that the Swiss consul had sent a protest letter to Izumi, informing him that the parade violated international law? And asked Kaburaki about the killing of the three American pilots and other issues. Kaburaki's testimony was vague, answered questions that were not asked, and always insisted: "I did not issue any orders" or "I do not know." He tried his best to shift the blame to Lieutenant General Hattori, the commander of the 34th Army who had died, and Izumi, who had not been captured.</p>
<p>Finally, the jurors asked if Kaburaki was acting on behalf of Hattori when he was absent. He replied: "Yes." Lieutenant Colonel West asked: "Then the orders he issued can be executed by you on his behalf?" Kaburaki cunningly denied it and did not give a definite answer, only saying: "If I can directly contact Hattori regarding affairs, he is responsible for directing them. I cannot change his orders." Lieutenant Colonel Harkins stood up to defend him and asked: "Was the order to carry out the killing determined by Hattori before he left Hankou?" Kaburaki replied: "It was issued by him before he left. Within the scope of my official duties, I cannot change his orders." Near noon, the court announced an adjournment and will continue the trial this morning.</p>
<h3>Labor Strike in the Cotton Textile Industry; Mediation Still Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>More than 50 factories in the Shanghai cotton textile industry, such as Shenxin No. 9 Factory and Yufeng, are requesting adjustments to wages. The industry unions in the third and fourth districts have summarized general opinions, including 11 articles such as a general wage increase four times a year and supplementary cost of living allowance, and have requested the party and government organs to mediate. After six mediations by the Social Bureau, there have been no results. Yesterday afternoon, another mediation was held at the Social Bureau, with more than 40 representatives from the labor side. According to the labor side, the focus of the dispute lies in the third article, the supplementary cost of living allowance, because the management insists on not following it, so mediation is unlikely to be optimistic. After the index issue is resolved, the other ten articles can proceed smoothly, but it is currently at a standstill.</p>
<h3>Employees of the Commercial Press Go on Strike</h3>
<p>The wages of employees at the Commercial Press in this city are meager, with monthly salaries of only about 10,000 yuan, which is difficult to maintain a living in the midst of skyrocketing prices. The employees have made four requests to the management: (1) One month of annual leave at the end of 1945, paid in full at the December salary rate. (2) The anti-war consolation money. Employees in Shanghai received an average of only 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per person, while employees in the rear received an average of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per person. They requested that the same amount of consolation money be issued and supplemented as soon as possible. (3) Monthly salaries should not be less than 50,000 yuan. (4) Before the request is resolved, each person should be temporarily borrowed 50,000 yuan per month. They also requested mediation from the Social Bureau. Recently, because the management has not yet replied with a definite solution, and prices have been fluctuating even more drastically recently, making it difficult for employees to live, they went on strike at 1:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>A Child's Foot Found on the Wasteland on Daji Road</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At about 3:00 PM yesterday, a worker, Li Shichong, found a child's right foot on the wasteland to the left of the Daji Road Public Sports Field in the South City.

<h3>Shen Wanling, Manager of Shengsheng Ranch, Accused of Collaboration; Investigation Concluded, Trial Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Following the case of Li Ze being reported by Xin Xin employees, Shen Jiu cheng, the owner of the Shengsheng Ranch, and his son, manager Shen Wanling, were also reported by employees such as Sheng A'di. Shen Jiucheng fled after hearing the news, and only Shen Wanling was arrested. The case has been concluded by the Procuratorate, and yesterday morning, it was publicly tried by Judge Liu Yugui in the Criminal Court of the High Court at Tilanqiao.</p>
<p>Shen et al. Accused of Aiding the Enemy</p>
<p>The charges of Shen et al. Reported by the informants were: (1) Repeatedly hiring Japanese such as Toyoshima Umeyano, Noguchi Shoichi, Seki Kazutoshi, etc. as managers, relying on the enemy's power to oppress workers. (2) Shengsheng Ranch cooperated with the Japanese company Nanzhou Ranch, renamed Shanghai Nongye Company. (3) Constantly providing fresh milk and butter produced to aid the enemy. (4) When employee representatives Zhang Daode, Zhao Yiwen, Li Yougen, etc. requested improved treatment, Shen et al. colluded with the enemy army Unit 2322 to illegally detain and torture them, forcing them to resign with grievances. (5) Shen Jiucheng's third son, Shi Yi, went to Japan to study during the War of Resistance and served as a translator for Unit 2322 after returning, relying on his power to bully employees. (6) Deducting the employees' allocated supplies and occupying them for private use, etc.</p>
<p>Informants Testify in Court</p>
<p>Sheng A'di, Zhang Zhiyun, Li Yougen, accountant Zhang Xingquan, business department employee Yang Baiying, trainee Diao Deming, and Wang Jiajin, who used to serve in Shen's private residence, all appeared in court to detail the process.</p>
<p>Defendant Describes What Happened</p>
<p>When questioned, Shen Wanling stated: He hired Japanese to cover the company's assets. Because in the early days of the War of Resistance, Shengsheng Ranch donated more than 17,000 pounds of milk to the National Army, the enemy and puppets once kidnapped my father in 1940. I was studying at the time and was sent to Lushan for training. I secretly joined the Youth League in 1939. In 1940, I was reported in the pseudo-China Daily, and the enemy and puppets paid attention to this, so I had to use the Japanese as a cover. As for the matter of aiding the enemy with products, it was under the coercion of force. Shengsheng Ranch was taken over by the Enemy and Puppet Industries Processing Bureau in December of last year after employees reported it to the special commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, but it was returned on January 15th of this year, which can serve as my proof. The employees accused me because of labor disputes, and what they said is all slander.</p>
<p>Defense Lawyer Presents Evidence</p>
<p>The defense lawyer presented many documents such as account books. The informants also presented two photos of the documents when Shengsheng Ranch was operating with the enemy. Japanese manager Seki Kazutoshi was summoned but absent. The court ordered that if both parties have evidence, they can collect and present it again. The case was adjourned for further hearing, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Li Hu Case Adjourned for Retrial</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Cai Jin also heard the case of Li Hu, the deputy officer of the Pseudo-China Central Fisheries Escort Team. After investigation, the case was ordered to be adjourned for retrial.</p>
<p>This morning, the cases of Shen Guanquan, Liu Jinrong, Wu Zhixin, Nakamura, Remidies, and others will be tried for communicating with the enemy.</p>

<h3>Fellow Northeasterners Enthusiastically Welcome He Zhuguo</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] General He Zhuguo, a famous general in the War of Resistance Against Japan, fought in the Huaihe River valley, eastern Henan, and Shandong for eight years. He was summoned to Chongqing shortly after the victory. He, known for his expertise in the Northeast, was appointed as the chief of staff of the Northeast Headquarters, and the plan to receive the nine provinces of the Northeast was drafted by him. At a banquet for the Soviet ambassador at the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, General He drank too much and, due to years of accumulated fatigue, his nerves were damaged after being stimulated by excitement and alcohol, and he suddenly lost his sight. Although he was treated by famous doctors many times, it was ineffective, so he came to Shanghai last week and stayed at Room 208 of the Ducheng Hotel. Following the doctor's advice, he did not attend any social events or receive any guests. It is said that he will leave the country on the 25th of this month to seek medical treatment in the United States. Last night, the Shanghai Association of Fellow Northeasterners specially held a dinner at the Jianghai Customs Club in Tongyi Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, to express their welcome. General He and his wife reluctantly attended, and military and political officials from the nine northeastern provinces, such as Zhou Yashan, Dong Hongyi, and Zhao Chengyang, also participated. The Shanghai Association of Fellow Northeasterners is about to be established, with more than 700 registered members. The organizing committee of 13 people, including Ding Guitang, will convene an inaugural meeting within a few days. Ding Guitang and Shi Bingyan gave speeches at the dinner last night.

General He also stood up to reply, briefly stating that although he has lost his sight, he is still willing to serve the country. The guests parted happily at about 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>First Person in This City to Report Inheritance Tax</h3>
<p>Bei Runsheng's Descendants' Law-Abiding Spirit is Commendable</p>
<p>After the death of Bei Runsheng, a giant in the dye industry, his heirs hired the famous accountant Xi Wangshu to declare inheritance tax on his behalf. Their spirit of abiding by the law is commendable. It is heard that the Direct Taxation Bureau is now conducting investigation work as the basis for taxation. The inheritance tax law was promulgated after the fall of this city. The Bei family is the first to voluntarily declare tax in this city.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Emergency Rumors at the Stock Exchange Building; Black Market Transactions Bleak; Gold and Dollar Market Prices Resemble Previous; Public Bonds Slightly Rise, Stocks Slightly Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's report stated that the authorities would take severe measures against major speculators in the stock exchange, and that public security authorities would punish them. As a result, many brokers suspended operations. However, due to the urgent need for supply and demand, there were still private transfers. The market situation was calm, with none of the former glory. The overall trend resembled the previous day. Credit gradually eased. Despite external pressure, it managed to hold. The morning opened hovering around 1.4 million, but many were intimidated by the authorities' stern warnings, leading to a low price of around 1.35 million. Credit sources were slightly looser than before. Money changers and northerners bought in at lower prices, while Sichuan banks and those with goods to sell continued to absorb in hopes of squaring their positions, briefly returning to 1.43 million, and then hovering around 1.38 million. Compared to the previous closing, it showed a slight increase. The afternoon saw emergency rumors, lacking support. Brokerage remained without posted prices. Silver remained at 1,600, with silver dollars selling for 800 yuan, and black market interest at 2 to 2.5%, suggesting a potential loosening.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange, particularly U.S. dollars, remained sluggish, only hovering. However, the trend was not as weak as the previous day, slightly more relaxed. The morning started at 1,940 to 1,960 yuan, with a low of 1,940 to 1,960 yuan, a high of 2,000 and 2,020 yuan, and a final price of 1,960 to 1,980 yuan. It fluctuated slightly with the gold market, with the situation similar to the previous closing. Hong Kong dollar stocks were stable, resulting in old stocks being strong and new stocks being slightly weaker.</p>
<p>Public bonds rebounded after weakening, a result of pent-up sentiment. There was slight activity among brokers, leading to this. Type C initially opened at 1,400 yuan, reaching a low of 1,200 yuan. Idle funds from various industries were absorbed at low prices, and brokers also felt a loosening. It gradually recovered to 1,540 yuan, and idle funds from various industries were absorbed at low prices, and brokers also felt a loosening. It gradually recovered to 1,540 yuan, closing at 1,500 yuan. Miscellaneous brands once retreated to 800 yuan, and Type E to 900 yuan, but finally rose with Type C to outside the 1,000 yuan mark, resulting in a slight rise from the previous closing.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks were weak, only hovering. Wing On Cotton Mill was at the 2,000 yuan mark, Mayer &amp; Feibel at 1,450 yuan, and King Fook Gold &amp; Jewellery Co. struggled around 110 yuan. People were somewhat disappointed due to the indefinite resumption of operations, resulting in a slight decline.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were also dragged down slightly. However, supply and demand gradually became more balanced. The continuation of the previous closing was seen, but not much, and trading was quiet. It was truly difficult to achieve widespread transactions.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market continued to trend sluggish, due to persistently tight credit. Fellow traders were eager to sell for funds, and customer firms were hesitant to buy, remaining in a wait-and-see mode. Manufacturers' willingness to purchase was also weak, causing prices to be unsustainable, falling another 40,000 to 50,000.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Customers Remain in Wait-and-See Mode</h3>
<p>Slight sales of cloth construction</p>
<p>Both holders of goods and customers remain in a wait-and-see attitude, believing that the authorities are determined to suppress cotton prices, and the market may not be sustainable. However, dyeing and weaving factories, because product costs have not decreased, adhere to the original prices, only hoping that customers will "move" early. The China Textile Company yesterday opened sales of 30-yard Taibai Zui Jiu yuan straight tribute for 54,000 yuan, 30-yard Jinlian Miao Wu yuan straight tribute for 48,000 yuan, yuan serge for 44,000 yuan, and 30-yard Shuiyue yuan feather satin for 75,000 yuan. It is said that hemp and wool textiles will be sold today.</p>
<h3>Cotton Transactions Scarce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no special progress in spot cotton transactions. Only the Textile Construction Company made slight purchases, acquiring 600 bales of American middling cotton and 100 bales of Tolles cotton, all raw materials for 32-count yarn. In addition, various yarn mills remained in a wait-and-see mode, with no transactions.</p>
<h3>Kerosene Can Blanks in Short Supply</h3>
<p>112-pound and 156-pound tinplate, with sizes specifically for manufacturing kerosene cans, are named kerosene can blanks. For several months, the amount of American kerosene shipped has been few, so kerosene can blanks on the market have gradually become scarce. If it is not used soon, there will be a shortage. The current price for 112-pound is 100,000 yuan per box, and 140,000 to 150,000 yuan per box for 156-pound.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Due to high production costs and scarce sources, rice markets are still active, and prices continue to rise by more than 1,000 yuan. However, the closing saw a slight softening. Flour also increased by 300 to 400 yuan. The oil market was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon, showing a soft trend. Yellow soybeans were scarce, and the market was stable. Soybean cakes saw a small increase of 100 yuan, raw kernels remained similar, and wheat bran was strong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Vary, Weak to Stable</h3>
<p>It is said that over 10,000 pieces of mixed sugar have arrived, so medium-sized white sugar is weak, falling another 2,000 yuan to a price of 47,000 yuan. Other relatively scarce goods are more stable. A certain company once opened a batch, including 24 coarse white at 72,000 yuan, Dutch red at 72,000 yuan, Hong Kong ice flower green at 48,000 yuan, and Branch foreign at 56,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Returns to Firmness</h3>
<p>The need for bituminous coal from factories has suddenly increased, while sources are limited. The supply of goods falls short of demand, and the market continues to advance. As for anthracite coal, the inventory of the same industry is also limited. Fortunately, actual sales are still weak, and there are not many transactions. Prices remain stable at a high peak. Due to the rising price of bituminous coal, some factories have switched to using chestnut firewood and miscellaneous firewood instead of tree firewood, causing the price of miscellaneous firewood to continue to be raised.</p>

<h3>Southwest Associated University Restoration Changes School Relocation Route</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kunming, this newspaper, 18th] Southwest Associated University Relocation Committee Professors Zhang Yintang and Li Jitong went to the Yunnan-Vietnam border two weeks ago to inspect the school relocation route. The two returned to Kunming yesterday. According to them, from Mengzi to Hekou, ten camels are needed to transport the supplies. The United University, in view of the difficulty of transportation in this section, has now decided to change the school relocation route. A part of it will take the route of Hengyang, Wuhan, to Pingjin, and a part may take the route of Luzhou, go down the Yangtze River, and then take a sea boat to Tianjin in Shanghai. The current semester of the United University is scheduled to end on May 4, so as to move in advance. After the relocation, the school will still recruit a part of freshmen in Kunming this year.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang's Recent Education Measures</h3>
<p>Director Xu Shaodi Speaks Frankly</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, this newspaper] Director Xu Shaodi of the Zhejiang Education Department made some explanations on recent education measures: (1) This year's education administration plan is being actively planned in order to implement it one by one. However, post-war education funds are still difficult and cannot meet the needs of education. Social order has not yet stabilized, which has not been without obstacles to education facilities.</p>
<p>Examination and Selection of Staff and Students</p>
<p>(2) The examination and selection of students from puppet schools has been divided into two types: grading and graduation. It has been designated to be held by public and private middle schools, and has been held separately in the middle of last month according to the schedule. Students enthusiastically participated, and the order of the examination was good. However, the results were very poor. This office is to show compassion for students in the occupied areas, so it will be handled leniently. Those who did not participate for some reason will also be remedied. The examination and selection of puppet teachers is scheduled from January 20 to the end of February. There are few people, and those who have not been examined and selected or those who have failed the examination and selection must not be hired. As for the puppet primary schools in various places, they are all taken over and rectified by the municipal and county governments, and the teachers are also examined and selected by the municipal and county governments. Primary school students do not need to be examined and selected.</p>
<p>Adding Vocational Schools</p>
<p>(3) In view of the geographical situation, environment and products of this province, the establishment of vocational schools should also meet this need to cultivate a large number of cadres and technical talents in the people's livelihood industry. In addition to the Hangzhou Higher Technical School, Higher Agricultural School, Jinhua Practical Agricultural School, and Dinghai Aquatic Vocational School, which were suspended due to the war, should be restored first. The school also plans to add cotton textile industry and applied chemical industry vocational schools as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Changing the Meal Allowance</p>
<p>(4) This year's treatment for secondary school teachers in the province, in addition to the adjustment of living expenses in accordance with the regulations, the hourly wage has increased slightly compared with last year. The treatment for specialist teachers in normal schools was originally the same as that for ordinary teachers. This year, the treatment for teachers in vocational schools will also be increased in the same way. As for the food expenses for public-funded students, relief students, and normal students in provincial schools, the subsidy fee for each person per month was 1,500 yuan and 2.3 dou of public grain last year. This year, because the public grain is cancelled, the meal allowance will be changed to 4,000 yuan per person per month. A semester is calculated as five months, and the province's public-funded relief normal school students, etc., are approved by the central government as 6,940.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Temporary Middle Schools</p>
<p>(5) After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the temporary middle schools were closed. The first and second temporary middle schools in western Zhejiang were changed to Jiaxing Middle School and Huzhou Middle School. The first, second and third temporary middle schools in eastern Zhejiang were changed to Quzhou Middle School, Chuzhou Middle School, Wenzhou Middle School, and Yanzhou Middle School to relieve students from losing their studies. All students are transferred to continue their studies in the branches. If students from each temporary middle school transfer to other schools due to family reasons, they should be handled according to the general transfer procedures. They should not be distributed. As for the public-funded students in each temporary middle school who transfer to other provincial schools in other provinces, because the number of places in each school has been determined early, the public funds cannot be transferred, and they must wait for the second semester when the school has vacancies for public-funded students before they can apply for replacements according to their grades. (6) The total number of education funds allocated by the central government for the whole year is 140,869,000 yuan. The cost should be followed by a budget totaling 605,562 million yuan, which will be compiled by the provincial government and submitted to the central government for approval. At present, only 60 million yuan has been allocated by the central government, which is a drop in the bucket. (Butterfly)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Special Issue of the Publishing Industry</p>
<h3>A Few Words in Print</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>At a time when various construction projects are being actively carried out, the importance of cultural work is conceivable. Chairman Chiang once stated in "China's Destiny": "It must be known that the final effect of this world war will undoubtedly be attributed to culture, so this war can also be said to be a cultural war. The success, failure, rise and fall of nationalism, democracy and social justice in Europe and the United States for the past 350 years are all in this battle. The rise and fall of China's 5,000-year-old culture and its moral spirit are also the touchstone for this battle. If this war does not fail in the hands of aggressors, then human civilization will be scraped and polished, and Chinese culture will be carried forward. I hope my academic circles can truly understand that today is the greatest juncture for Chinese culture to carry on the past, open up the future, preserve existence and continue the extinction.</p>
<p>In the past, during the Anti-Japanese War, in the occupied areas of Chongqing, there was more destruction than construction. Some cultural workers could only guard their posts under extremely cautious and restrictive circumstances; the situation in the rear was difficult to develop rapidly due to the limitations of material conditions, and it was quite laborious to maintain the original situation. Because of the war, the cultural circles of the whole country were divided into several regions, and there was no communication with each other.</p>
<p>The scope of culture is very broad. In a more abstract sense, morality and customs can be said to be the culture of a country; in a more concrete sense, drama and singing are manifestations of cultural work. However, the most formal and effective thing is to talk about publishing.</p>
<p>The cultural level of a country can be distinguished from the quality and quantity of the books and newspapers they publish, because published publications can circulate in various places and promote cultural exchanges. The Westerners have a saying: "Transportation is culture." We can also say: "Culture is transportation." This sentence is very simple, that is, when our published publications are sold from one place to another, then our thoughts are also transported from one place to another. With the power of publishing publications, we can promote our inherent culture, so that Europeans and Americans, even if they do not come to China, can know everything about China. This kind of effect can only be harvested from cultural work, especially publishing. Therefore, the greatness of the power of publishing is self-evident.</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, cultural circles in various places hoped that cultures in various places could exchange with each other, but because transportation was not smooth, it could not be carried out as soon as possible. Cultural warriors who struggled hard during the Anti-Japanese War hoped to proceed step by step after the victory, but there are still many difficulties in front of them, such as the fact that transportation is still not smooth and the high cost of manufacturing figures. Therefore, the current publishing industry is really struggling in a difficult period.</p>
<p>Taking the publishing industry in Shanghai as an example, there are quite a few types of publications published after the victory, and the total number is not small, but the sales volume of each publication alone is not large, because the sales area is limited to Shanghai. At the same time, the cost is high, so the current business of the publishing industry is quite difficult.</p>
<p>Fortunately, those engaged in the publishing industry do not take profit as a prerequisite, or want to exert their own ambitions, or have the enthusiasm to serve the society, so even if the environment is difficult, they are still working hard.</p>
<p>What should be done most at present can be divided into two aspects. In the near term, colleagues in the publishing industry can unite to discuss and deal with and solve all difficulties, and refer to the situation of foreign publishing industries as a lesson for improvement; in the long term, they can encourage all sectors to increase their interest in reading, so that the sales of publishing publications can be expanded. The policy of this magazine can be carried out in these two aspects, hoping that all sectors will give assistance from time to time.</p>
<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>The Psychology of Configuration</h3>
<p>— Wang Shilei</p>
<p>Original work by Kart Lewin, published by Zhengzhong Book Company, for university use.</p>
<p>Translated and narrated by Gao Juefu, first edition in Shanghai, November of the 34th year (of the Republic).</p>
<p>The author of this article, Mr. Wang Shilei, is one of China's leading psychology experts, currently a professor at National Lantian Teachers College in Lantian, Hunan, and has written extensively. —Editor</p>
<p>Decades ago, Mr. Gao Jueshu provided a very concise introduction to the research trends of the Gestalt psychology school and the special contributions of K. Felom (Lewin) in the preface of this translated book.</p>
<p>According to Lewin himself, the book "Principles of Configuration Psychology" is not intended to establish a new school of psychology. One of the main motivations of this book is to develop a psychological vocabulary that can be understood by all, without being limited to any particular school of psychology. This book offers some conceptual tools, which are derived from the extensive experimental research of Lewin's disciples over the past decade and have been verified in many experimental studies. Lewin is confident that regardless of the school of thought, these concepts are fundamental to many winter psychological research procedures.</p>
<p>Lewin also acknowledges that merely applying Gestalt geometry cannot solve psychological problems, just as applying Euclidean or Riemannian geometry cannot solve physical problems. However, in recent years, there has been a clear trend that any psychological theory must presuppose certain spatial concepts. For example, the formula "behavior is a function of the person and the environment" seems to have gained general acceptance among psychologists. This contains a theoretical field proposition (Atheoretical Field Proposition). Even research based on conditioned reflexes as a fundamental principle admits that all psychological behavior depends on "a group of simultaneously existing facts" (Hull). Isn't this the same as saying that it depends on a group of simultaneously existing facts as a spatial field? Furthermore, every school of psychology applies a construct as a basic concept of movement. This theory contains the properties of a vector: concepts such as excitatory tendency, drive, libido, or psychological force all presuppose the direction of the psychology and the space in which these directions are located.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see that the spatial problem of psychology must be solved by all schools of psychology. Lewin is confident that using the terms Gestalt geometry and hodological geometry to describe space in psychology, rather than Euclidean geometry, has clear mathematical significance. Lewin has made it very clear in his article (Formalization and Progress hiPsychology) what contributions this research method and concept have made to the description, explanation, and prediction of behavior. Whether we agree with Lewin's views or not, we cannot deny the hard work and pioneering efforts of him and his disciples.</p>
<p>In the past, the translator of this book has made great contributions to the introduction of important psychological literature. The translation of this book, in particular, is meticulous and painstaking. I was fortunate enough to have a sneak peek at a portion of the translated manuscript. It can be said that this famous book and famous translation possess both beauty and substance. I believe that those who study natural sciences and social sciences will gain many novel insights if they can study it.</p>
<h3>The Joy of Reading</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>If all the publishers in Shanghai were to convene a meeting to discuss the sales of publications, they would undoubtedly lament in unison that although Shanghai has a population of 5.5 million, the number of people who read is so small.</p>
<p>Logically, according to the proportion of the population, the sales of each publication should increase tenfold compared to the sales in other places. However, the reality is completely inconsistent with the theory.</p>
<p>Many people say that the reason why Shanghainese do not read is because Shanghai is a place with too many entertainment venues, thus all their space and time are spent on other entertainment. Ordinary men do not read, ordinary women do not read, working youth do not read, and even students rarely read books other than textbooks.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many exceptions, and the number of people who should be classified as exceptions is also considerable. Otherwise, the sales of publications would be even lower.</p>
<p>I believe that reading is the most enjoyable thing. Naturally, before experiencing the joy of reading, one will not say that reading is enjoyable. This is the same as other forms of entertainment. Before understanding a certain entertainment method, we may refuse to try it. However, other entertainment methods will have people to persuade and entice us. Only reading requires initiative.</p>
<p>In general, after people leave school, they break away from books. However, they therefore sacrifice many of life's pleasures, and they abandon the opportunity to absorb new knowledge. Purely from the pleasure of reading, if a person has a job during the day, in their spare time, they can put on casual clothes, choose a corner of the house, and flip through a few pages of books related to their profession, absorbing the latest knowledge, which can be immediately applied to their work. During the application, there will be a sense of supreme pleasure. If they browse a few pages of books for recreation, it can relax their tense nerves. This kind of leisure and leisurely pleasure can only be obtained through reading.</p>
<p>If one is a housewife, then after finishing household chores, she can open her favorite books without any restraints, and can obtain a kind of leisurely pleasure. Moreover, most household chores require physical labor, and reading can be used as a mental adjustment, which is most in line with the conditions for self-cultivation.</p>
<p>If one is a student, then he can choose various publications that introduce new knowledge to enrich himself and increase his wisdom.</p>
<p>The Chinese have always valued scholars because scholars can create a kind of refined style, as the saying goes, "A belly full of poetry and books makes one's aura naturally elegant." A person who is well-read and a person who is illiterate are very different in terms of speech and behavior.</p>
<p>Of course, the times are progressing, so the books that modern people read must be practical and adapted to the environment. Moreover, useful time cannot be spent reading meaningless books. Speaking of the economic aspect of time, because the acquisition of experience takes many years and several failures, but by reading books, one can acquire experience in the shortest period of time. Anyone who has not yet enjoyed the pleasure of reading can start immediately, experience the joy of reading. When deciding what to read first, simply ask yourself what knowledge or things you most want to know, and it will not be difficult to find the books that best suit your needs.</p>
<h3>Cultural Movement Outline and the Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>— Su Wen</p>
<p>Recorded from Mr. Zhang Daofan's article "Prospects for the Cultural Movement"</p>
<p>"The essence of culture is upward progress and self-improvement, that is, what Hegel called 'a higher level of liberation'." This liberation includes the individual's pursuit of spiritual elevation and the nation's pursuit of spiritual freedom. Its process is a kind of movement. Since the Reform Movement of the late Qing Dynasty, there have been many routes and chaotic steps in the cultural movement in our country. At that time, foreign culture was neither well selected nor absorbed, and international political aggression shook our inherent excellent national virtues. In the hundred years of the late Qing Dynasty, "the nation and the people, in politics, economy, society, ethics, and psychology, all showed signs of decline and foreign aggression, with internal crises lurking, almost destroying the foundation of our regeneration and cutting off the source of our revival" (quoted from Chairman Chiang). If the founding father had not adapted to the trends of the world while inheriting historical traditions and advocated the cultural movement of the Three Principles of the People, Chinese culture would not have regained its upward path today.</p>
<p>The process of the cultural movement should include two stages: one is cultural struggle, and the other is cultural construction. The cultural movement of the Three Principles of the People has already completed its mission of struggle in the process of the National Revolution. The task in the future should be to advance on the path of active construction, with the ultimate goal of completing the five major constructions of psychology, ethics, society, politics, and economy.</p>
<p>The Cultural Movement Outline promulgated by the central government in the winter of the 32nd year (of the Republic) briefly put forward the principles of the five constructions: (Although the outline was published three years ago, it is still worth following at this time)</p>
<p>Psychological Construction: Establish a revolutionary outlook on life, reform the bad habits of the people who live for the moment and are cold and selfish, and be able to raise a positive spirit, establish self-confidence, and practice revolution.</p>
<p>Ethical Construction: Improve the behavior of the people, restore the inherent morality of the nation, and promote it, cultivate the noble and healthy personality of the people, so that our 450 million compatriots can sacrifice the small self, abandon self-interest for the benefit of the group, be loyal to the country, be filial to the nation, believe in righteousness, be benevolent to the people and cherish things, and promote peace and mutual assistance.</p>
<p>Social Construction: To enable the lives and actions of all members of society to follow certain rules, and to enable all basic undertakings related to the welfare of the people to be built up in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>Political Construction: Based on the spirit of encouraging the people to be autonomous and proactive, strengthen the ability to exercise power and promote the realization of national politics.</p>
<p>Economic Construction: I will do my best, the land will do its best, things will do their best, and goods will circulate smoothly to enrich national defense and improve people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Zhengzhong, Striving Forward</h3>
<p>— Wen Yao</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Zhengzhong authorities bore the greatest responsibility for the publishing industry. This reporter visited the bureau to report on the dynamics of the publishing industry and wrote this introduction.</p>
<p>In the new China, among the publishing industry, the most youthful, the most energetic, and the most promising future, Zhengzhong is probably the most hopeful member.</p>
<p>The enemy's artillery fire not only wanted to destroy our lives, but also needed to destroy our culture. Zhengzhong, under severe losses, moved west with the government. At that time, most of China's publishing industry remained in Shanghai and Hong Kong, forming a separation. The problem of supplying books to the rear had to rely on it to support the overall situation.</p>
<p>The life in air-raid shelters and under tung oil lamps is not enough to express its hardships; the publication of more than 2,000 reference books in the midst of war cannot be said to be a great achievement; only the sacrifice of private interests and the relief of the panic of textbooks in the entire Great Rear Area, so that tens of millions of students would not be without books and abandon their studies, is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>The matter happened when the enemy was spying on the Southwest. At that time, the nationally designated textbooks had not yet been compiled and printed, and even the old approved editions from Shanghai and Hong Kong could not be transported internally. The panic over textbooks had reached its peak. Zhengzhong resolutely contributed all the copyrights of their compiled and written "Nation-Building" textbooks to the country, so that education institutions in various places could reprint them themselves and supply them locally, which barely overcame the difficulties. Even later, the nationally designated editions compiled by the Ministry of Education were partly revised based on Zhengzhong's "New China" editions.</p>
<p>Last winter, after Zhengzhong came to Shanghai to resume business, in addition to printing a large number of textbooks, it also pioneered a new type of book published every day. In the midst of difficult recovery of production, such achievements are indeed commendable. It is said that they will increase the production quantity recently, to two types published every day. This will probably be realized after the spring sales.</p>
<p>Zhengzhong does not have extraordinary funds or special advantages, but for several years, it has relied entirely on strong perseverance to work hard in its position and create indelible historical achievements. If it is said that it is a sincere star in the Chinese publishing industry, it is better to say that it is a brave soldier in the cultural revival camp.</p>
<p>I silently wish that Zhengzhong can continue its past glory, complete even greater tasks, and remain eternally young.</p>

<h3>Outlook for the American Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>Mr. Windelrich, Editor-in-Chief of the American "Saturday Review of Literature," recently gave a speech stating:</p>
<p>People in the book publishing industry look forward to maintaining their wartime profitability after 1946, but they deeply feel that they need a plan for publishing and sales in the future. Publishers, spinners, and booksellers all believe that the surge in book sales after 1939 may only be a wartime boom, unless the problems caused by the surge in textbook sales are resolved and the sales of a large number of books and periodicals are stabilized with improved domestic and international technology.</p>
<p>The "Domestic Commerce" monthly published by the US Department of Commerce, No. 24, states that since 1943, the number of books published in the United States has more than doubled. The total value of books published in 1945 was about 150 million yuan. The number of books published has not actually doubled, only because book prices are also rising, but its increase cannot be said to be small. The printing industry has experienced unprecedented prosperity during the wartime shortage of materials and various restrictions. The sales of children's books hit a record high. Commercial activities related to more joy and books have greatly developed and expanded their business. Department stores, pharmacies, book and magazine publishers, distributors, and book clubs have all expanded their book sales business.</p>
<p>The recent trend of interest in reading can be seen from the act of purchasing. In the kingdom of practical introductory books, the books that veterans and their families are most interested in are books on residential construction, interior decoration, and cooking.</p>
<p>There is a large demand for new books for career entrants and textbooks (including the crystallization of wartime teaching methods), technology and professional books. The sales of children's books will continue to increase. Books will greatly help families solve the problems of readjusting from wartime life to peacetime life. The sales of religious books, especially the Bible, will also increase significantly.</p>
<p>Judging from the fact that readers' interests are so broad, people's reading ability still needs to be further explored. The Christmas issue of the "Chicago Sun-Times" published a large number of special articles on the new standards of authors, editors, and publishers, showing that people in the publishing industry have faced the problem of how to maintain the best-selling books and periodicals that came with the war and adapt to this demand. If they cannot solve these problems, they will inevitably face the danger of recession or over-prosperity. Mr. Qi Wen, Chairman of the World Publishing Company, summarized: "Everything is very favorable to us, the large reduction in illiteracy has gradually expanded our market. The awakening of people's interest in political and economic development continues to stimulate people's demand for books and periodicals... and newspapers and books are powerful tools for cultivating social atmosphere."</p>
<p>Some publishing attempts reflect this spirit. The great success of handbooks and the booming sales of reprint books have paved the way for other 25-cent reprint books. The first collection of popular books (a total of 20 books) was published in its third edition on January 2, including Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath," and the market was very good and popular for a while.</p>
<p>Other publishing experiences - like reprint books, have also left the experimental stage - including current news-type books compiled and printed by editors who know the needs of readers. "Outlook" magazine has published several kinds of books and periodicals in this category in the past two years. All of them are compiled by the staff of the magazine and published by various bookstores. Johnson's "Wilson" is one of these collective creations; Sterner's "One Nation" is another. "Outlook" is a painting magazine, so these books are mostly rich in illustrations and texts.</p>
<p>In addition to realizing the unprecedented booming sales of books, people in the book industry are mutually warning themselves to act cautiously. "Publishers Weekly" recently published a special article calling on the book industry to investigate the current situation of bookstores and other book markets, stabilize distribution work, and encourage emerging talents.</p>
<h3>Publishing News</h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Book Company was founded by Mr. Sheng Jiyang, a senior figure in the publishing industry, and has a history of 20 years. It specializes in original Western books from Europe and the United States, and is highly valued by the academic community. Since the victory, in response to environmental needs, a large number of American books, including chemistry, electricity, civil engineering, textile, accounting, medicine, etc., have been transported, more than 200 kinds. All circles are welcome to visit the address: Room 713, No. 13 Jiujiang Road.</p>
<p>Personnel Issues in Publishing: The most difficult thing to solve in all industries is personnel issues. This book is the latest work by Mr. Xu Wangzhi, created with sharp eyes, lofty ideals, and based on his 30 years of experience in serving the business community. The liveliness of the writing and the novelty of the compilation are secondary. It is distributed at No. 20 Nanjing West Road, and all major bookstores sell it.</p>
