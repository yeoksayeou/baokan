<h3>三人會議昨今繼續休會　研究中共整軍對案　馬帥昨分別與俞周晤談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕三人會議今日繼續休會一日，因馬歇爾特使鑒於過去之經騐，認為凡重大而複雜之問題，如事前未能作充分準備、則開會不僅徒費唇舌，且足影響會議時各方之情緒，而坐失稍縱即逝之良機。惟昨日深夜，馬使發出通知時，僅定休會一日，今因美方及政府代我對中共今日提出之整軍對案，尚須作縝密研究。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿大日電〕軍事三人會議定明日繼續休會一日，周恩來定明日上午十一時往訪馬歇爾，又據聞整軍間題之遲未討論，乃因中共方面之對案尚未提出。現悉中共之對案業已擬定，並於今日下午送交馬歇爾。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕周恩來今日下午自二時起至下午六時止，均在馬使行館中商討整軍問題，今晚馬使會接見俞交長，有所洽談。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕民盟代表張申府·章伯鈞·沈鈞儒·梁漱溟·黃炎培·羅隆基今晚九時赴梅園新村聽取中共八路軍副參謀總長滕代遠報告關於軍事方面之情形，是時梅園新村門省街燈如晦，行人寥寥，十餘記者均於黯淡之燈光下守候此一新聞，迄十一時止，尚未完畢。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕第三方面代表，今日午彼三時，在鳳頤村舉行內部商談，談話結果，有意見兩點：（一）認為和平前途正面臨嚴重關頭，希望和平成功，不願多生枝節，以免影響和平，（二）盼中共對整軍之對案，早日提出，以便整軍會議趕快舉行。此兩點意見，前者由各代表分別轉達，後者則由梁漱溟今夜赴梅園新村轉達。又第三方面明日下午，將再有一內部之商談。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京廿六日電〕今晚據可靠方面消息：關於三人小組，執行總部與執行小組中美方代表之權力問題，前曾發生激烈爭辯，刻已獲致諒解。在和平談判中最困難問題之一獲得解決之後，各代表即可集中其全力討論軍隊整編問題。據悉：共產黨代表團對於整編問題，已提出建議，請國民政府考慮，此等建議，係由周恩來於今日下午二時三十分親自交與馬歇爾將軍。周恩來與馬使密談幾達三小時之久。並悉，渠將於明日上午九時再與馬使會晤。關於中國和平調處機構中美方代表權力之諒解，其詳情如何，目下尚無所知，但消息靈通人士認為此項諒解，大部份根據共方建議，即美方代表有權提出獨立報告，進行調查，並執行三人小組之決議，三人小組決議必須一致同意一點，依然予以保持。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿六日電〕新民報今日戰稱：國共雙方對於蔣主席六月六日停戰令中三項問題之末一項，即軍隊整軍駐軍問題，均願相讓，國府方面準備在進駐各區讓步，中共方面則願意在二月二十五日協定各點退讓，唯要求在東北擴大共軍比數，其理由為東北「民主聯軍」人數甚多，原來雙方商妥之東北駐軍數為共軍三師，國軍十五師，現共軍要求增加兩師。三人軍事小組「因雙方意見仍懸殊」，今日並未會議。</p>
<h3>彭部長答外記者問　希望某些方面　放棄煽動政策　關於整軍等方案主席曾再三修正</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕廿六日下午四時半，中宣部舉行外記者招待會，由彭部長及外交部劉次長主持，茲記其重要問答如下：</p>
<p>（問）上星期夜間，下關車站請願代表被毆時，若干外記者曾在塲目擊，歷時數小時之久，軍警並未盡力保護，似若有人指使，此事應由何人負責？</p>
<p>（彭部長答）政府對於下關鬥毆事件，甚表惋惜，此種暴行，決難寬恕，警察對於雙方在車站辯論責駡，至數小時之久，未能及早解散，至鬥毆發生，又未能及時制止，雖謂本市警力單薄。又缺乏運輪工具，難於迅速調動，但保護不力，難辭其咎，政府已將槪管警察所長撤職，並將首都警察廳長申城，鬥毆發生後不久，大批憲警趕到，驅散羣衆，救出負傷者，吾人對於負傷者，十分同情，對於暴動者，十分憤嫉，但對於同日在上海發生之同類事件，不能不順便提及，當請願代表離滬之際，有數千示威運動者，到站送行，歸途經過靑年會，竟闖入宿舍，提捕反共學生數人，於毆打及撕毀衣服之外，並於其背上，用黑漆大書侮辱文字，綁縛遊行，在附近公園，舉行所謂民眾審判，此數學生，亦於最危險時間為同樣遲到之憲警所救出，此事件恰巧發生於下關事件之前數小時，對於和平代表等背後所代表之和平與人權保障，投一諷刺之照明，余十分懇切希望某些方面，放棄此類陰慘之策略，勿煽動可愛之靑年，將不明外間情祝之老年人，套入民眾運動之光頭，以造成宣傳之慘案，吾人略有所聞，同類之煽動，正在積極進行，吾人亦欲請願於背後牽綫之諧公，至少從人道主義觀點，重新考慮此種計劃。</p>
<p>（問）中宣部稱羣眾為蘇北難民，如謂屬實，何以證明？暴行者究已逮捕若干人？其姓各籍貫為何？難民究竟是否如當日之羣眾頗有組織？</p>
<p>（彭部長答）蘇北難民羣居於下關車站附近者數萬故附近居民極易辯識，暴行嫌疑者八人被捕，其中二人已證明無辜被釋，另有二人名成瓊與陳錫輸者，證明為參加暴行之人，將受依法之懲罰，如君等有暇可往探視，正在暴行發生之數日前，蘇北難民等正在發起組織協會，該會已於廿四目成立，昨日請願代表招待記者會中，難民協會並曾對請願代表正式道歉，為諸君之所目覩。</p>
<p>（問）六月廿九日以前，最後協定應希望達到如何程度？聞主席已修正其關於共方撤退某某區域之要求，可否請加說明？</p>
<p>（彭部長答）主席在停止前進命令中，所指示之三點，即停止衝突，恢復交通，整編軍隊，必須於月底以前求得確切之解決，主席曾再三修正其方案，以遷就共方之要求，在此階段，詳情尙不能發表。</p>

<p>〔聯合社南京二十六日電〕內政部今日發表：據最近統計，全國人口總計約四七〇·〇二六·二五二人，包括台灣省六百萬人在內，海外僑胞則除外。</p>
<h3>美國務院重申在華美軍任務　目的在助我遣送日軍</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿五日電〕美國務院發言人，重申在華美軍之任務，係應中國政府之要求，用以協助遣送在華日軍者，美軍在華之惟一目的，亦即在此，蓋前據南京訊，毛澤東曾要求美國立即停止對中國政府之一切軍事援助，並撤回駐華美軍，故發表上述聲明。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕美軍司令部在華之工作範圍，漸見縮小，故美軍司令部人負亦隨之減少，在本年七月，人數將更減低，美軍司令部參謀長麥特斯將軍，已定於七月四日離滬返美，總司令吉倫將軍則仍留此，美軍在滬之空軍司令部，現已取消，空軍司令伊文斯將軍，己於日前離滬返國，該部縮小範圍，改為空軍部，主理空中交通事宜，由麥克雷諾斯任司令。</p>
<h3>蕢延芳等昨赴國府　晉謁吳文官長　陳述此行目的吳氏允轉達主席蕢語記者對中共行徑已有認識</h3>

<h3>何應欽張嘉璈抵瀋　東北行營有於下月起改為行轅說　蔣經國謀恢復外交接觸</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕東北局勢之轉換，似正在幕後進行。何應欽今晨偕軍調部參謀長蔡文治飛瀋陽，並可能赴長春一行，傳廿九日可南返。何行前極秘密，昨晚其隨員尚稱何不擬赴東北，此次使命，可能相當重大。東北行營有於下月初改為主席行轅說，仍由熊式輝任主任，杜聿明任副主任，萬福麟馬占山等東北耆宿，亦將有相當名義。蔣經國之甫返東北，表示政府正覓取途徑，恢復東北之中蘇正常外交關係，因自蘇軍撤退東北戰事發生後，蘇外交官與一部僑民，亦隨軍撤退，正常外交接觸，即告中斷。此外中長路如何恢復通車，及大連接收問題，當亦為蔣氏所欲解決之問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿五日電〕東北行營經委會主委張嘉璈，廿五日下午三時由瀋飛抵長。據語中央社記者稱：渠廿五日晨十時離瀋，道經四平街，曾着陸視察會晤劉耀東主席，並察看破壞不堪之油廠，勾留凡三小時，渠此次來長，係第三次，將中長路事稍作料理，定廿七日仍返瀋。</p>
<p>東北戰氛仍極濃厚</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕東北軍情：（一）東北戰爭空氣仍濃，據杜聿明電此間有關當局，松花江北岸烏拉街榆樹間，集結共軍騎兵甚多，擬在泡子沿渡口渡河，揚言將進攻永吉九台。（二）官方消息：瀋陽遼陽間之煙合煤礦，廿三日被共軍二百餘人襲擊，附近村民二人被槍殺，熱河之北票煤礦，近亦被炸毀。（三）共軍在東北小規模交通破壞戰，仍時有發生，共軍支隊千餘，一度侵擾新民附近公主屯，廿三日經國軍擊退，已退回康平，錦州至新立屯支綫上之清浸鬥車站，十九日夜亦被共軍襲擊，車站被焚毀，附近電綫橋樑，亦有破壞，路局事後雖已搶修通車，惟共軍仍在附近活動。威脅尚未減除。</p>
<p>熱省共軍調動頻繁</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕廿日前潘陽撫順外圍，雖曾有小衝突，目前則已平靜無事。惟戰神之陰影，則迄未能自白山黑水間根本移去，刻熱河共軍，不斷由察魯兩省增加重兵。官方情報，最近由張家口東凱開河共軍約五千，由山東繞道入熱河者約三萬人，如八日後和平談判破裂，則此等兵力即或為中共再度問鼎東北之新資本。政府方面亦不無準備。惟在任何空氣下美方均不放棄其和平之信念與努力，短促之停戰期，美方人員僕僕風塵，出入槍林彈雨中，已完成若干調處之準備工作。刻廿九小組已出發四平街以東之海籠，卅小組已赴潘陽以南之海城，展開其和平工作。</p>
<h3>希爾上校飛平轉魯　將執行恢復交通　同蒲北段共軍攻陷沙峪</h3>
<p>〔本報甫京廿六日電〕北平軍調部美方交通管理處馬氏顧問希爾上校，偕同北平軍調處交通科共方代表黃逸峯，明晨九時乘機飛平轉赴山東，執行恢復交通事宜。</p>

<p>我國關稅政策　政府正研究改善　由於各國採取自由貿易政策我不能用關稅壁壘對抗外貨　　〔中央社南京廿六日電〕關於我國現行關稅政策，國人多主張重加老慮，因大量洋貨之進口，各重要市場均有逐漸被壟斷之危險，國貨前途，殊形暗淡，此種增大我國際收支不平衡差額一事，其對於國家經濟之危害甚大。頃據財政當局表示：奢侈品之進口，已嚴令禁止，不必要之洋貨，將設法課以重稅。至現下我國關稅政策，政府進行研究改善，由於各民主國家採取向由貿易政策，處此潮流之中，我國絕不能採用關稅璧壘，以對抗外貨之進口，但為發展我國工業起見，將採取適當之步驟加以保護。</p>

<h3>褚逆民誼獲準再審　檢察官提出抗告　認蘇高院裁定實屬不當</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿六日電〕蘇高院自於六月廿四日發表再字第四號裁定，核准褚逆民誼漢奸案開始再審，已引致該案承辦檢審官李曙東之反響，認為此項裁定，實屬不常，特於廿六日下午六時許，向高院提出抗吿，理由書另錄，請求撤銷再審之裁定，記者聞訊後，即馳赴分謁院檢兩首長，承孫院長談稱：中國司法之檢察制度，原屬獨立，本案旣經檢察官認為不合而提出抗吿，本院自應依法請示最高法院，以為最後決定。韓首席則吿以凡經三審裁定之判決，依法不得再生異議，本案再審之裁定，似缺少法律根據，即就事實而言，褚逆徒託效忠國父，保全文獻之名，而行危害國本阻撓抗戰事實，不應藉為聲請再審之理由，是以檢察官提出抗吿，當靜待三審法院之最後決定云。茲錄其抗吿理由書如下：</p>
<p>抗告理由</p>
<p>江蘇高等法院檢察官抗吿理由書，被吿褚民誼，右被吿因漢奸案件，經本院於中華民國卅五年六月廿二日裁定，開始再審，本檢察官於同月廿四日接受送達，認為應行抗吿，茲敍述理由於後：本件原裁定准予開始再審，無非以聲請再審人，所稱被吿曾於民國卅一年間赴平，向日軍交涉領回國父靈臟，奉安陵園，又在滬與日軍力爭，將已被查封之國父遺著孫文學說原稿，及建國大綱手書等索回，有南京寗海路看守所詳細紀錄可稽，事關效忠國父，保存文獻，不無處理漢奸案件條例第三條之情形，原確定判決未予審酌，依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第廿八條第二項，應認為有再審之理由，惟效忠國父不在靈臟之奉安，而在遺囑之遵守，不在遺著之保存，而在遺敎之奉行，國父致力國民革命四十年，其目的在求中國之自由平等，其方法在聯合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奮鬥，國父遺囑詔示至明，茲被吿於中日戰事發生以後，即與在逆等通謀敵寇，組織偽政府，反抗本國，圖陷我民族於萬劫不復之地，此為最高法院覆判所確定之事實，是其所為，顯與國父遺囑有違，不忠莫大，其向日軍交涉領回國父靈臟，索還國父遺著，與其組織偽政府，潛處國民黨，盜用國民政府名義，同一用心，不過藉以籠絡民心，淆惑觀聽，以達其破壞抗戰，反抗本國之企圖，此奸臣賊子之慣抜，中外古今不乏其例，日抗戰而勝，國父遺著雖為敵寇查封，何患其不還，戰而不勝，國家淪亡，國父遺著雖存亦將無以奉行。按處理漢奸案件條例第三條，漢奸曾為協助抗戰工作或有利於人民之行為，證據確鑿者，始得减輕其刑，又特種刑事條件訴訟條例第廿八條第二項，為受判決人之利益，聲請再審，亦以判決確定後，因足影響於判決之重要證據漏未審酌，認為有重大錯誤，為其要件，各該條規定至明，本件被吿與日軍交涉，領回國父靈臟，索還國父遺著，縱屬實有其事，但如上所述，其行爲旣非協助抗戰，於人民又無利益可言，且被吿假效忠國父之名，而行其籠絡民心破壞抗戰之實，就其犯罪之手段言，依刑法第五十七條第四款，尙應從重論科，原確定判決，期予審酌，處以被吿極刑，並非有重大錯誤，聲請人之聲請再審，顯無理由，原裁定遽予照准，即難謂合，爰於法定期間內，提起抗吿，並叙明理由如右。江蘇高等法院檢察官李曙東，中華民國三十五年六月二十五日。</p>

<h3>汪逆之子文悌　處徒刑一年半　準予緩刑五年付保護管束</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕汪文悌漢奸一案，廿六日上午經首都高院宣判，主文如下：「在文悌通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，處有期徒刑一年六月，褫奪公權五年，全部財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外沒收。在文悌緩刑五年，在緩刑期間，付保護管束」審判長趙琛說明理由。略謂：被吿年輕識淺，隨父從逆，出任偽官尉校，尙無積極叛國行動，依法應减輕其刑二分之一，且誤入逆途，情狀不無可憫，並應酌减其刑。又因被吿未曾受有期徒刑之宣吿，合於緩刑條例，故予緩刑。趙氏並論被吿緩刑期內，付保護管束，應知改過自新，效法乃父之前半世功勛，而不應留念乃父之後半世逆跡，則五年之後，應可卒業大學，緩刑期滿，依法仍得為「未曾受有期徒刑之宣吿者」之新人。汪逆文悌當唯唯而退，未作任何表示。據首都高院表示，如無覆判情事，將於判決書送達後十日內，交保開釋，交由警察局執行。</p>

<h3>社評　中國人民的對美態度</h3>
<p>一昨合衆社華盛頓電訊，國務院某官員稱：『莫斯科電台報吿謂美國與中國有「秘密協定」，延長租借法至一九四七年十一月一節，事實上此間並無根據。』又稱：此項消息或係根據目前國會考慮中法案條文之誤解；此法案將准許總統給予中國以軍事協助及其軍隊所必需之物品，以『履行聯合國憲章中美國所負之義務。』國會或將授權總統不僅至一九四七年十月，且延至此後十年；同時馬歇爾之和平程序如進行順利，在正式統一未實現前，共軍亦將得到援助。我們在讀到這電訊的時候，毛澤東却在延安公開發表反美言論，謂美國軍事援華，實係武裝干涉，並要求美國立刻停止對華軍事援助，撤退駐華美軍。同時，本市發現有反美標語，且美軍人員有被少數羣衆包園漫駡情事；此項事件的發生誠為不幸。旣有是項反美標語及行為發生，為了表明中國人民一般的意向，對於這種卑劣的攻勢，我們要揭發其眞相，並表示我們的態度。</p>
<p>首先我們要聲明的就是這種反美標語及行為是少數敗類所為，決不能代表中國一般人民的意向。在擊潰日寇的努力上，中美靑年，彼此曾比肩作戰；傳統的中美友誼，經過了這一番血的洗禮，是愈益凝固而緊密了。在立國的精神上，民族的性格感情上，乃至地理環境上，沒有兩個民族能够像中美兩國那樣的接近。中國的抗日戰爭雖吿勝利，但國民革命的大業依舊還沒有完成；為完成我們的革命，我們正需要一個偉大的兄弟之邦如美國那樣的援助。中國人民對於美國在華的種種努力，特別是這位譽滿犬下的五星元帥馬歇爾特使的種種努力，無不深表感謝之忱。如果中國人民對我們偉大的鄰邦除了感謝之外，還有什麽別的感覺，這感覺是他們覺得美國對於我們的援助似猶未够，這大約也許是由於他們希望過殷之故。因此，任何反美情緒决不是中國人民自發的；任何反美情緒也决不能代表一般中國人民的情緒。</p>
<p>莫斯科「紅星報」二十二日撰文評中國局勢，指摘美國對華援助，大發排美之論，此在蘇聯方面的報紙，原非初次，在「消息報，」在「眞理報，」以及代表紅軍發言的「紅星報，」本常有反美的論調；出現在中國的反美宣傳攻勢，實多少與莫斯科的反美論調不無關聯。何以言之？中國人民對美有傳統的友誼，這友誼因戰事而更為凝固緊密，中國人民本身决不會有反美情緒，這是可斷言的。中國共產黨為了要掩飾自己的罪行，不欲有公正的的第三者看見它所為的種種不法行為，又與莫斯科互通聲氣，於是發為排美之論，發動反美的宣傳攻勢。這是共產黨的一種策略，這策略與其說是出自延安，無寗說出自共產國際的麥加。我們從一個較遠的角度來看，出現在中國的反美宣傳攻勢，不是中國人民一種自發的情緒，而實與出現在世界其它各地的反美攻勢相呼應，彼此為有聯絡的一環。</p>
<p>這是在這個意義下，所以共產黨的所為，實為有背於民族利益的行為。我們要提高國人對於共黨的警覺，像陳公博之類的顯明的漢奸現在是繩以國法了；而在我們中還有無形或不明顯的漢奸。中國人民的知識水準縱較低落，對於過去顯明事實的鑒別能力是有的。中國人民對於誰友誰敵也有確切的認識，掩飾不了他們內心的傾向。</p>
<p>我們更覺得有趣的，是莫斯科「紅星報」的反美論調，與毛澤東的反美言論，不特在時間上彼此遙相呼應，而且它們的內容完全一致，這眞是中國人民的呼聲嗎？我們希望中國人民拿出鑒別力來，別再來做第三者的應聲蟲；盲從的人應該明白他們怎樣在被人家利用而貽誤了國事，應該及早回頭。至於美國的朋友們，我們信任他們有鑒別這種偽裝的能力與智慧。由於這種具有國際性的反美攻勢的展開，中美兩國人民彼此間應有更深的了解和更緊密的携手；世界和平的維繫就建築在這基礎上。</p>

<h3>義政府當局發表宣言　決全力維護主權　薩拉蓋特當選制憲會議長</h3>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬廿五日電〕新近選出之義大利制憲議會，今日舉行首次會議，並選舉議長，由凡爾賽和會四巨頭中碩果僅存之奧蘭杜任主席，出席議員約五百人。投票結果右翼社會黨前駐法大使薩拉蓋特以四〇一票對六七票當選。蕯氏年四十八歲，在第一届臨時政府中任不管部閣員，曾反對與共黨合作。今日會議中最可注意者，為一致要求保留維尼齊亞求里亞爭執區。主席奧蘭杜宣言，並無物質的勢力與不道德的交易，可使特里埃斯特及該區內之其他城鎭脫離義大利。據奧氏稱，今日危及國家生存之威脅，較歷史上任何時期更為可怖。巴黎外長會議所擬加於義大利之待遇，係侮辱我作戰陣亡之數萬健兒，使之成為奴僕，為至今仍以敵國視我之外人作戰。若果如此，則在號召我人作戰者之榮譽上將留一暗影，歷數百年而不已。總理加斯貝利繼之宣布，曾在巴黎四國外長會議中聲明，義大利人民決不能容忍此種肢解，若和約條件太苛，聯合國將有熄滅世界所亟需之光明，而使其重歸黑暗之危險。</p>

<p>三月暴動事件</p>
<p>〔改造社東京廿六日電〕國際法庭今日傳訊幣原後，進而審訊從未揭露眞相之著名三月陰謀暴動事件，傳證人淸水行之助到庭作證。淸水早與各種國家主義團體發生關係。一九一九年與北一輝，岩田富美等自中國返日，即參加大化會，一九二四年組織大行社，從事日本國粹運動。海倫檢察官先朗續淸水之口供錄稱：「（一）一九一九年與北一輝同道歸國，將北一輝介紹給大川周明。（二）至一九三一年三月止，大川時在金龍亭酒館與橋本欣五郞等陸軍將校聚會。據大川所言，此等將校以改造日政府為目的，企圖革命。余為此目的曾捐助二千元與大川。余之任務為當大川等舉行示威運動時向議會堂外投擲炸彈。大川曾訂劃引軍人入議會佔領政府。</p>
<p>炸彈三百　據大川謂，橋本自陸軍獲得炸彈約三百個，余乃加以收藏。（三）後大川言：此計因參與陰謀之陸軍縮手而失敗。又據大川洩漏，宇垣大將曾參與該項計劃。當大川以計劃進行失敗吿小磯軍務局長時，小磯曾答謂：「此計之放棄，乃基於陸軍之直接命令」。其後由德川義親侯爵之要求，乃將炸彈交還參謀本部之根本博上校。（四）一九三一年八月某日，大川謂：「本人將與川本大作上校，憲兵大尉甘粕，關東軍參謀次長板垣上校在瀋陽發動某種事件。」（五）一九三二年十二月出獄後，曾與大川數度晤面。大川為組織神武黨極其忙碌。該黨為極端國家主義團體，以驅逐白人出亞洲及改造日本政府為目的。一九三二年三月頃，大川曾謂：「與對日政府抱不滿之海軍靑年軍官及橘幸三郎等。共同參與某種陰謀」。余乃謂今後將不能參加該項計劃。」讀畢，由辯護人李凱克斯作反訊問：小磯及根本關係如何？炸彈還於何人？（答）因德川侯爵之要求，向小磯請示交還方法，其結果遂將炸彈還與當時任新聞班長之根本中校。（問）在三月事件後，另有此類計劃否？（答）不記為翌年抑為再翌年，大川又向余談及海軍官與茨城農民團將發動某種行動，命余參加，余鑑於三月事件之失敗而加以反對。</p>
<p>五一五事件　其後得悉大川曾參與五，一五事件。（問）此事與此次戰爭有何關聯乎？（答）無何關聯。（問）關於瀋陽事件之爆發，大川曾有何種言語吿汝乎？（答）雖無明確意見吿余，然在酒肆酒醉後曾謂：「三月事件雖失敗，但最近在瀋陽將有某種有趣問題發生。」（間）大川對於此「某種有趣事件」曾談及其內容否（答）雖未明言，但由常識已心會。（問）何謂由常識已心會？（答）意即在不言中已領悟也。繼由淸水對被吿橋本欣五郞之辯護人林一郞之訊問答稱：三月事件之目標，在於糾彈當時為黨政黨略而忽視國民幸福之政友會及民政黨，並無侵略性質。（問）神武會網領中有無驅逐白人出亞洲一條？（答）無。（問）汝在口供錄中謂神武會以驅逐白種人出亞洲為目的，與此刻之證言不同，孰為眞實？（答）當時社會之一般觀念如是。（因淸水不作明確回答，答非所問，致使嚴肅之法庭充滿哄然大笑，雖經林一郞重行追問，但淸水終不作明確回答，只得作罷。）</p>
<p>其次傳證人德川義親，宣讀其口供錄稱：「本人熟悉大川，曾與之討論鼓吹昭和維新問題，</p>
<p>驅逐白人　渠曾述泛亞細亞主義及白人之壓迫亞洲民族等。一九三一年曾與大川議論將軍國主義者置於政治當政地位之計劃。該年二月中旬，陸軍上校河本大作來謂奉軍務局長小磯之命令，請余往晤大川，勸彼等放棄置政府於軍部下之計劃。大川乃遵照軍部之意行動。數月後，小磯謂淸水拒絕交還三月事件所用三百枚炸彈，余乃勸淸水交還。」繼由辯護人作反訊問：當時小磯少將是否係該計劃之策劃者？（答）不知其詳。（問）當時知該項炸彈之性能否？（答）其後始知係不能殺人之假炸彈。（問）口供錄中有「置軍國主義者於政府當政地位」一語，常時曾用此種表現否？（答）未曾用軍國主義者一語。（問）所謂軍國主義者是何意義？（答）用軍之力量之意。大川當時認爲余用軍之力量以外，不能打破常時之黑暗政治。</p>

<h3>上海經濟危機迫切　外商代為聯各函市長並呈建議書　高物價高工資亟待解決</h3>
<p>上海英國商業團體代表葛士威克，荷蘭商業團體代表多利，瑞士商業團體代表勃立脫，挪威商業團體代表何果考，法國商業團體代表薛考脫等，日前聯名致函吳市畏國楨，並附呈建議書，備述田於勞工問題所引起之高物價高工資及勞資糾紛等等，以致本市生產品成本過大，生產萎縮，經濟危機至迫，情形異常嚴重。茲將建議書譯錄如下：</p>
<p>建議書全文</p>
<p>（一）余等對上海經濟問題亟願有所建議，尤以關於因勞工問題引起之高物價，高工資及糾紛等等。（二）貴市政府發佈之生活指數，最近激增，五月份為52.02％，遠較過去數月為高。總之，生活指數比之一九三六年已增加至少四千佑。（三）在此通貨膨脹期間，統制外匯率亦同時施行，美金票之核定，較之一九三六年前之價值，則僅增加五九三倍。（四）通貨膨脹與統制外匯造成一種三項不平之結果：第一，外人遭遇之影響，余等深信中國人亦然，無論在私人生活方面及經營商業方面，均感受消費損失不貲。第二，本市生產成本過大，由於競爭價格，簡直不能製造產物。第三，製造成本之所以過高係因勞工問題及運輸問題，出口更無論矣。（五）此種情形已繼續有六個月左右，完全是一種極顯明之不變性的敗壞。因此余等可斷言，在以後數星期中，上海之經濟情形倘無法改善，則本市多數企業為維持最低狀態，將縮小營業範圍，或關閉工廠及營業所。此種行動，當非企業家所願為也。（六）結果失業者必大增，成千成萬之人無工可做，亦無法謀生，此種危機決不能以平心靜氣之態度，默思其事。市長多次講解關於高物價，高工資的危險（使一般資方難能照付其員工），如此情形，倘不加改善，經濟之崩潰指日可望。（七）如不將此種實情，呈報市長，不僅辜負本身，更有負於市政府及勞工界。即以市民立場而言，余等亦深覺應負勉共患難之責。為保障資方之幸福起見，經濟不利情形，決不應容其長此籠罩於上海市。具呈人：英國商業團體代表葛士威克，荷蘭商業團體代表多利，瑞士商業團體代表勃立脫，挪威商業團體代表何果考，法國商業團體代表薛考脫。</p>

<h3>警備部提訊任星崖</h3>
<p>〔本報訓〕糧貸案昨日並無新發展，汪達人任星崖自地檢處移解警備司令部後，昨日下午軍法處單獨提訊任星崖，現該案之進行頗顯沈悶，何日正式開審，尚無決定。軍法處日來一方面整理偵訊結果，一方面靜侯上峯之指示及糧部之答覆。又據警備部表示，糧貸案係奉蔣主席命令辦理，應依軍法審判，絕非普通司法案件。</p>
<h3>中醫師代表　晉京請願　為考試院限期檢覈事</h3>

<h3>全市出差汽車現有四百餘輸　吉普車　出租問題　各車行尚在考慮中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市已登記之出租汽車行共卅三家，汽車四百零七輛。計祥生六二、亞洲一三，新新二，中國聯業二〇，安泰一二，滬東二，順風一四，中國交通九，通利七，新閘一五，大來一九，滬南一五，公大一三，友寗六，華麗三，東華二四，中華一九，上海七，中央興隆三一，海達一〇，大華（車輛數尚未登記），飛雲二九，中山九，揚子（車輛數未登記），開利一八，東方四，億太（車輛數未登記），滬嘉二〇，卡德九，福州（車輛數未登記），綠寶一〇，新生五，百樂（車輛數未登記）。</p>
<p>事實上全滬出租汽車尚不止此數，因有若干私人之車輛依附於上列車行名下營業，而登記時則不列在內。各車行之營業均極興旺，因汽車速度既快，價格便宜，較之其他交通工具合算得多。戰事初平時，每二十分鐘一干六百元，後加至二千四百元，顧客仍擠寒於門，往往須排隊等候，甚至發生爭吵等事。車輛均終日奔馳於外，極少返行休息之機會。最近因物價高漲，車行擬加價至四千元，然社會局僅准加至三千六百元，故迄今尚在交涉請求。現司機每日工資約為一元七角，照工人生活指數計算，普通職員月薪約六十元左右，亦照工人生活指數計算。目前國外新車及材料尚無進口，故車輛損壞後之補充修理頗成問題。最近行政院物資供應局擬以每輛美金一千六元之代價撥吉普卡一千五百輛交各車行組織聯合公司。行方認為吉普卡在冬季及風雨時頗不適合，勢必加以改裝，而將來新車進口後，營業亦頗堪慮，且兩年內分期付款之辦法，各車行是否能善其始終，亦為使負責人擔心之問題，故條件方面尚在考慮中。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據市公用局負責人告記者稱：目前曾有人向該局呈請，擬向美國訂購大批吉普車略經改裝後，即公開出租，然美軍部曾有命令限制吉普車專供軍用，故公用局無權批准，現正向市府請示中。</p>
<h3>兩颱風醞釀中　京滬區將遭襲</h3>
<p>本年度第二次颱風，自於溫州登陸後，風力即消滅，然連日本市尚有強力勁風。記者昨再訪中央氣象局上海氣象台負責人，據談本市連日遭受勁風襲擊，原因為自颱風過後，尚有高氣壓自北太平洋昇入長江以北，同時以江西以南有低氣壓流入京滬兩地，因以高低氣壓交併，遂發生強大風力。至帛琉島之北，發生之颱風，自消失之後，該島東部，頃又有一強烈颱風，在醞釀中，同時中國南海亦有颱風醞釀現象，惟方向及風力，速力，尚米能悉，今日可能確定。據預測，此後風力將超過上次，京滬兩地恐艱免遭受侵襲。茲將上海氣象台之每日報告併錄如后</p>
<p>熟帶氣流佈滿全國，太平洋尚穩定於日本，琉球及花島山鳥。熱帶低壓區或可能颱風，在帛琉之西北。</p>
<p>天氣預報：黃海曇霾，清勁東風，中度至巨。海浪。</p>
<p>華中，曇，局部陰，有雷陣，中度不定向風，晨有霧。上海，陰，時曇而熱，晨有霾霧，清和南風。東海，曇，清勁東風至南風，中度海浪至局部巨暴。</p>

<h3>許多好消息　莫嘆出無車　公用局正不斷努力　公共汽車將大增</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紅色臨時公共汽軍四輛，已於本月二十一日起，正式加入三路舊有路綫行駛。該項車輛係向祥生汽車公司購得，又該公司尚有團體客車多輛，可能售與公用局，充作臨時公共汽車，據悉法商公共汽車公司，即將有二十輛新式公共汽車應市，十月中可自法運到。公用局將於適當地點，設立同定停車場。</p>

<h3>江上緝私工作尚感實力單薄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨晤本市水上警察分局長吳克孝，與談該局最近工作及緝私情形。據稱：該分局依照編制可有警士六百名，惟現因提高素質，須中學程度考試後再加訓練，故目前合格工作之警士僅二百餘名。該局在黃浦江設分駐所三處，派出所十一處，現有巡邏船七艘，均已陳舊不堪，其中三艘且已損壞，尚在修理中，對於工作不無影響。所餘四艘除三分駐所各派一艘外，分局僅剩一艘。晝間相互對開，終日巡邏江面，夜間加開雙班，澈夜工作。至於緝私方面，僅係協助關警性質，最近曾緝獲大批漏稅之美煙及糖果，均已交與海關。吳氏並稱：上海環境複雜，經百年租界及八年敵偽之統治，加以帮會勢力之影響，欲完全剷除沿江及碼頭上之惡勢力，殊非一朝一夕之事云。</p>
<h3>偽宣傳部次長　章克答辯如演講　偽最高法院院長　張韜受審　大搖大擺　金牙閃閃口氣惡劣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕偽宣傳部次長章克，杭州人，四十三歲，早歲畢業於哥倫比亞大學，後又在柏林大學政讀，歸國後曾任陳友仁之私人秘書，香港陷落後被俘，在滬蟄居多時，後卒應林逆柏生之請，就任偽宣部次長，凡四月另十天，辭職後發刊「大公」周刊。前由高院提訊一過，昨日下午審結，被告對起訴書晝辯多時，抑揚挫頓，宛加高聲演講。其內容可分二點：（一）在偽宣傳部次長任內，從未發表推行和運，宣揚偽職之文字或演講，（二）而在其發刋之「大公」周刋上，則盡力貫澈其在偽職任內未能貫澈之任務，而從事指斥偽府，宣揚抗戰之工作。嗣又列舉「大公」各期之文字以為佐證。庭上又問其投偽經過，則稱：「林柏生跑來對我說，汪精衛之病已無救，死了加何善後？我就說祗有解散偽組織，召集民衆代表會議來決定，乃與陳公博商定，遂出任偽宣傳部次長，以進行該項工作。商量時，曾琦·季思浩均在座，亦明知此事，決非我侮辱他。」言次嘶聲力竭，忘其所在，為法官所止。後經洪士豪律師為之義務辯護後，庭諭辯論終結，定七月二日下午二時半宣判。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕張韜，浙江蕭山人，現年六十一歲，係國民黨員，從民國七年起，在杭州·上海二地做了九年的律師，又曾出任北平大理院推事，及江浙兩省各級法院庭長等職。中日戰起，忽而變節，民國廿七年，溫逆宗堯，梁逆鴻志等在滬組織「維新政府」，以圖反抗中央，張任偽「立法委員」兼「經濟委員會委員長」，至廿九年三月，汪逆精衛，陳逆公博等組織南京偽國民政府，樹立叛逆政權時，又轉任偽最高法院院長，直至敵偽瓦解，始被捕法辦。昨晨高院開審時，張穿藕灰色綢長衫，內襯自紡綢短衫褲，灰襪黑鞋，鼻架老光眼睛，手拿一把竹骨扇子，大搖大擺，雙手撐着被告欄。答供時，張口就露出二隻金牙齒，口中不斷地說着「是哦」？「庭上懂哦」？之類不恭敬句語，手中的扇子也跳起舞來，可是被法警拿去了，他就失去了一個幫助表情的道真。據張供稱：他與陳則民為同學，畢業於遜清之時，後即在法界服務。民國十三年加入國民黨，十七年舉行黨員登記時，因係西山會議派被擯棄，遂將黨證撕毀。後來雖又入黨，然未領得黨證。在其偽經濟委員會委員長任內，日方曾要求將鐵道，電信，水電等十大公司歸日商經營，均遭彼等拒絕，不予通過，可見朱嘗不利於國。至「最高法院」事，謂亦不過是司法而已，亦無禍害國家之處云云。至十一時許，始行退庭，諭改期再訊。</p>

<h3>錢永銘談幣制　改革之說尚非其時</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪交通銀行董事長錢永銘氏，即以對目前國內一般經濟財政現狀之意見。渠稱：目前國內經濟財政之轉捩點，仍與整個政治問題之解泱有關。蓋以政治問題未解決，全國交通未能暢通，各地經濟全融之構通，均告隔絕，稅收亦無法復原，故國家財政，實無法平衡，因面出現赤字預算。至改革幣制之說，錢氏認為目前似不可能。且幣制改革方案，貴乎能一勞永逸，決不能一而再，再而三。故目前改革之說，尚非其時。錢氏對中央銀行之外匯及黃金政策，認為適宜。惟渠希望中央銀行對我國之內匯問題，應多加注意。錢氏末對本市之財政金融前途，表示樂觀。渠稱：蔣主席對政治大局，苦心孤詣，而馬歇爾特使更不辭辛勞，奔走斡旋，故甚望國內各方面，能相忍團結。更望對當局施策常有抨擊諸人，應積極參加合作，各抒己見，勿徒事空評，而於實際則毫無裨益云。</p>

<p>秩序井然</p>
<p>昨日觀衆約計萬餘人，俱為救災而來，軍警　兵，昨天隊出動，緊要路口，除佈置崗位外，並有鐵絲網，防綫數道，故秩序井然，但不守秩序之球迷，徘徊塲外四週，直至終塲前一刻鐘，一部份觀衆，仍衝破籬笆而人，幸比賽不久即告終結。昨日兩隊出場陣容如下：</p>

<p>比賽在國歌聲中開始，裁判張樂，杜月笙步入塲中，行開球禮，撥動皮球，兩軍接觸，張金海截得來球，下令攻擊，孟義良中樞坐鎭，擉斷去路，五分鐘時，費春華單騎深入，霍躍華趕救不及，小費初試脚頭，惜乎偏斜未中，未幾，羅偉櫂中路起義，卅碼處試射，越門高逸，未一分鐘，孟義良誤犯左脚王，許竟成卅碼外主罰，球勢峻急，奈又稍偏，又吿野逸。十分鐘時，保正小傳右角，春華邊路徐進，到得好處，舉足力射，中兆恒懷抱。形勢平均各有攻守。</p>

<p>遷敬一隻</p>
<p>拍賣義球及給獎旣畢，兩陣再圓，星東原班人馬應戰，靑白羅壽福小休，徐德明替補入塲。開賽後，青白前鋒，環攻不捨，二分鐘時，靑白得義良接濟，正待傳中；繼華犯規，禁區十二碼，許文奎主罰，左上角破星東球網，一比一，造成和局。二分鐘前一隻十二碼，二分鐘後，亦是一隻十二碼，真所謂平分秋色，禮尙往來。</p>
<p>秋亭妙中</p>
<p>青白得手，士氣大盛，九分鐘時，小費單槍匹馬，長驅直入，小傳左角，曹秋亭及時趕至，十碼左右，再破敵壘，二比一靑白反敗為勝。十五分鐘，保正臥地救球，又吿犯規，兆榮主罰未有所獲，時耀華退出，碩友進補左翼，松生移前衛，羅偉權居中，許竟城退為左後衛，經此調動，星束乘機猛攻，然仍無補於事，終塲前二分鐘，吳祺祥為羅偉權猛撞，重傷離塲。未幾，時間終了，二比一，靑白再勝星東。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處紐約廿五日電〕紐約時報廿三日登載一文，叙述上週喬路易土與億來康舉行重量級拳賽時之電視廣播情形，按此為首次利用電視廣播之奪操賽，據該報訊，自電視幕上觀，看及聆聽比賽之人數，是較擠滿比賽地點楊基體育塲者為多。紐約，菲拉德爾菲亞，華盛頓各地，儿備有電視收影機者，可於若輩家中，俱樂部，或旅館，觀看比賽經過。若千愛參觀人數達數百人，不下三千拳迷，當集普林司頓之RCA實驗室，觀看拳賽演出。尙憶拳賽廣播係廿五年前開始，其時傑克鄧賽時卡本第亞在澤西城舉行奪標賽，自該時起，無綫電則有若干發展，去週之電視廣播，則為此方面之最新發展</p>

<p>金價無特殊變化　港票比美鈔吃香</p>
<p>烚赤昨再穩定，中央配給價酌提高至一九五萬，配出二四五條，人心以水漲船高，更為堅定，晨開已見小秀，開後鑒於幣制改革，微露端倪，買戶尙殷，微挺至一九六萬五，始有浮多脫手，加之中央登記配給為配給價格關係，買戶稍吿旁觀，惟交易有限，並無時殊變化，午刻微挫至一九四萬，午後又哄高至一九六萬五左右，結果較前收好起一萬五，飾金念萬零八，紋銀價平，息價自一角三分至一角六不等。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔仍難激動，晨開平平，晨開平平，中途小升至二六八〇元，但為時至暫迨未金價微回，午刻在二六五〇元左右徘徊，午後稍吿微升，惟漲勢不逮黃金，結果仍較前收微升十元，港票仍吿吃香，自五一五元升至五三〇元以上，結果較前收再升十二元。港滙自五二〇元升至五三五元左右。帶好印滙。升至六五〇左右，英匯八千五至八千元，成交仍以港匯為活，美匯明平暗呆。</p>
<h3>公債交易零星</h3>
<p>公債交易仍屬零星，由多空互相軋直，大勢呈拉鋸局面，事實上喊價離事實尙遠，空方則不欲多事流連，見利紛補業中雖有種種幼稚而膚淺之所謂決議，組織散漫，有識之同業亦不加十分重視，是以大部份袖手旁觀，現下進行塲外交易者，都屬零星居多，統丙高價八五〇元，低價七七〇元，最後仍在前日價盤旋，雜牌續見喊上一步，結果丙種平疲，雜牌再穩。</p>
<h3>紗布穩定</h3>
<p>昨日紗市轉趨穩定，華南帮復見光臨，雙馬又升到一百五十五萬，收市獨俏六萬，其餘廿支中小型價殊平庸，成交不多，午時紡建公司照例開紗，廿支中有藍鳳供售，價較上期之豐年標高三萬元，其餘各支粗細紗綫標價均與上期相仿。</p>
<p>嗶嘰坯布氣勢依然堅挺，此因客方銷路尙堪維持，故人心良好，嗶嘰因市上缺現，獨升千元，細布染廠及客帮皆有需求，亦昻五百元，其餘無甚軒輊。</p>
<h3>糖市堅挺</h3>
<p>昨糖市以現貨仍缺，趨勢堅穩，公會劃盤，現貨中砂白初為十一萬元至十一萬一千元，後為十萬〇八千元至十一萬元，升千元，路貨十萬〇八千元至八千五百元，後仍為八千元，棧單較堅，十一萬二千元至一千元，後為十一萬元至十萬〇九千元，收盤十一萬元，四半次車白劃十六萬八千元，又第三十二次標售敵產糖一批，計一百二十砠一百卅六袋，一百八十砠七百五十包，均為八萬六千元，中砂九百卅七包，九萬八千元，冰糖三百四十七包，十六萬二千五百元，三半車白一百〇四包，十六萬八千元，又次廿五包，十四萬五千元，地脚糖五十五包，八萬二千元，查合灣公司前日所開之中砂白，行方申請購額為三萬餘包，昨已决定照數供給，其中現貨佔百分之二十五，路貨為百分之七十五，生砂亦開八萬六千元，號貨開出刁靑三十包，九萬五千元，三號氷六十簍，十二萬二千元至五千元，興化赤數十簍，十萬〇五千，興化白十二萬六千元，次之十二萬元至十一萬八千元</p>
<h3>米糧到貨增加　市場趨勢穩定</h3>
<p>米市塲昨日客貨登記增加，總數二五〇六石，較前市激增一二四二石，內計埠尖二〇石，蕪秈一一四石，碾秈二三七二石，並米號自運自銷者四五二石，故一般趨勢仍穩定如恒，（昨日白元陰元，市價下趨，係米市塲懊報，實際市價並未更動，）麵粉形勢尙穩，步升二三百元，麩皮暫平，油價早堅午懈，價格彷彿，黃豆高貨尙定，中下胃呆，價跌五六百元，蠶豆定局，茶豆相仿，芝蔴亦少軒輊，豆餅汕頭納胃不濃，鄉銷甚懈，市形平正，小麥舟山寗波汕頭均無意進取，市况軟化</p>
<h3>投機妙用　多頭逢高出籠　股市又起回風</h3>
<p>華股昨突起回風連日外行游資見熱加入，永紗多頭公司乘機出籠漲後多盤，散戶及新多又起動搖，昨市不支而退，惟冷門小股有一二本身活動，突放異彩，中法高價做至二一七元成交，高價迫於大勢，亦稍帶小，但潛勢仍俏，晨開後最高時永紗五六〇元，美亞三六〇〇）元，景福二五五元，新光二七七元，勤興二二〇元，午前最低時永紗五一八元，美元三二〇〇元，景福二一八元，新光二三〇元，勤興一七〇元，而後略平，冷門中小型亦穩後微落，結果較前收永紗美亞回跌半成，景福新光一成左右，勤興一成半，冷門中小型除信和贈股須担負認股半數，回跌達一成，餘者均回挫殊微。</p>
<p>外股業中有一部份證券帮，鑒於封關在即，有所脫手而轉疲，怡紗晨開即退為九七〇〇元，美聯八四〇〇元，開後繼續下游，午刻疲後稍回，結果較前收英聯怡紗紙業亞洲各跌一成光景。怡　會德豐鋼業跌半成左右，業廣雖跌而尙少。</p>
<h3>房產業停滯　木材積貨多</h3>
<p>台灣磁磚亦有到貨　勝利以後，普遍性之建築，未見若何開展，八年以來，山地儲積已久之木材，咸冀於勝利以後，供建築上之需要，不意時至今日，適得相反之結果，現木材雖已運至都市，但走銷無路，貨價日跌，聞杭州方面，坐候於本行待售之木客，幾有生活開支超過木材價値者，近來運杭木材愈來愈多，而裝滬運銷，反多虧耗，杭地堆存木材，其中處木佔十分之四，徽木及浙西木材佔十分之五六。</p>
<p>閩木圓桶等木材，近以經營是項木業者，多非業中人，仍抱戰時單帮式之經營方法，故上項木材，　滬頗多，滬地應用木材，以方形為大宗，而方形木材，又以洋木為主，圓木鎖路，多在每年冬季，專恃蘇北一帶鄉間作為建築房屋之需，平時銷路殊少。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕台灣磁磚，前由滬商運來一批，行銷頗佳，聞下月上旬，又有一批可以裝滬銷售。</p>
<h3>浙絲廠已開工　川絲無法輸出</h3>
<p>浙江區因　汎較平，故目前各絲廠均已開始　絲工作，並有數十担生絲運滬，江蘇區蘭汎較遠，致開　者尙少，中蠶公司以外銷絲須合標準，故已於上週函知各貸款絲廠，將所繅生絲，槪交由該公司代收。</p>
<p>又春爾貸放實數，本係一，六八八。四七七萬元，已誌前報，茲據中蠶公司業務處負責人謂，春蠶貸款核准廠商中之合豐協記絲廠，其已貸金額係四〇·九五〇萬元。故貨放實數為一。六九四，四川產新絲，最近大量登塲，惟因運輸困難，外銷發生阻滯，　來市價日趨下跌，每關担由二·二五〇·〇〇〇元，跌至二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，尙無受主。絲商刻正設法運滬銷售。</p>
<p>人絲標售　另定辦法</p>
<p>本市：中信產委員會，最近由各處運到敵產人絲數量頗為可觀，聞中信局因防少數人操縱，並使大小廠商均能標得起見，對標售辦法，將略有改動，一俟辦法改訂後，該項人絲即可標售，</p>
<h3>銀行法應重行修正　金融業出路在時局安定　李馥蓀氏發表重要談話</h3>
<p>上海為全國經濟重心，勝利以還，游資充斥，巳成投機市場，金融業存欵之運用，大成問題，據銀行業公會理事長李馥蓀氏稱：敵人投降以來，政局不安，交通阻塞，物價因而暴漲，在此種情况下，金融業當然未能盡其扶助工商之責任，業務亦多未合理想，李氏强調金融業之出路，謂時局安定，金融業始有辦法，因政局安定，交通恢復，物資暢流，工商繁榮，金融業之業務，自可發揮其應有之功能。李氏繼謂：目前各銀行，除辦理滙兌外，投資於商場中為多，工廠貸欵極少，一部則轉於蠶絲，棉業等貸欵。甚有冒險作投機事業者。關於穩定余融問題，李氏表示：常秉承中央政策，並依照中央銀行規定辦法辦理，李氏認為中央銀行之措施，甚為洽當，一般主張調整利率一事，李氏以客觀語調，謂此事並不簡單，應多從事實上研究。記者復詢以對於修正後之銀行法之意見。李表示仍有修正必要，並謂：本人現正與立法院商討應行修正各點，因我國情形特殊，銀行管制法令，應效英國寬的方式，不宜採用美國緊的政策，關于不動產抵押諸問題，均應重行加以研究修正，最近即可具體决定，彼時將有新銀行法規頒佈云。</p>
<h3>桕油漲風未艾</h3>
<p>柏油在昔夏季本為銷塲淸淡時代，自從皂廠勃興，反變為熱閙季節，本月初皂用大增，銷路頓旺，市面直線上漲，兩週間飛騰二萬餘元現雖似見定勢，然餘焰未熄，尙有續漲可能，且本市客貨均巳開完，惟行家手貨不弱，均在待價而估，但杭州蘭溪漢口等處都報價漲，故漲風一時尙未有艾也，各行售盤隨市而加，計禾本柏油八萬五千元，內坪油八萬元，獨砠七萬八千元，蘭汕七萬五千元，蔴城油七萬二千元。</p>
<h3>紡建增產計劃</h3>
<p>紗布約增加下分一　南洋各地紗債大漲</p>
<p>紡建公司，最近即將增加產量，棉紗現日產一千包，擬增為一千五百包，布疋日產一萬八千疋，擬增為二萬六千疋，平均增產二分之一左右</p>
<p>近日棉紗市塲，略有波動，尤以申新廠所出之廿支雙馬牌為俏，已升至一百五十餘萬，有繼續上漲趨勢，據悉：過去棉紗市塲，均較其他物價穩定，此次波動原因，係由他種物價刺激，及金鈔抬頭之影響。廿支雙馬牌，南洋各地價格高至每包二百萬元，故運銷較暢，價格尤高，聞紡建公司，近日所代出之棉紗，均在一千包以上。</p>
<h3>執貨者居奇　現棉交易稀少</h3>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊繼續高翔，又暴漲卅四至四十六磅音，計近期美金二九，九八，遠期三〇，一七，米特林現貨三〇，六一二，本埠現棉市况看高，蓋以美棉愈漲愈勁，一般執貨者火都居奇，以致雙方談判不易接近，致交易甚為稀少，僅無錫申新第三廠採辦普通米特林二百包，送廠價十萬一二千元，此外花號曾做開烏拉圭四百包，棧交價作五十元美金云。</p>
<h3>平價粉來源成問題　目前將暫行停辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前以米價暴漲，平民粒食維艱，本市社會局吳局畏特商准糧食部駐滬特派員辦公處，每日撥發麵粉一千五百袋，配由郊區各米號，平價發售，每斤初為二百元，後又核减為一百五十元，每日每戶，至多以六斤為限，每米號每日配售二十袋，多至三十袋，均以售完為度，一般貧民頗受實惠，但以供不數求，頗有爭先恐後情事，該局爰商由民政處令知各該區公所，先行調查貧戶，預備憑票配售，此項手續，已將次完成，但糧部辦公處已奉令撤消該處已正式函知暫行停辦，以後如須續辦，　向儲運處商辦，而儲運處又有從緩設置消息，此後平價粉能否繼續，據悉，現在尙無把握。</p>
<h3>溫州新珍眉　昨成交百餘箱</h3>
<p>每祖開價十六萬元</p>
<p>向銷歐美各國之珍眉綠茶，自抗戰勝利後，茶業中人均紛紛復員籌製，且尤以浙江溫州，因地土關係，故茶葉生育最早，上項花色，今年新貨業已製就，並已于日前裝運抵滬，無奈受成本高昂之影響，國外限價甚緊，以致出口困難重重，迄今尙未成交，邇來茶商仍在積極謀展開之道，昨日市上，已有百餘箱成交，為本市某茶行吸進試銷，做開價每担為十六萬元，照此價格，貨方尙能博得蠅頭之利，然出口行恐難樂觀，至于各種內銷茶，持者一味堅售，但本街店莊等胃納猶足，乃雙方授受不多，情况賡續平穩，惟台灣紅茶及芽茶，宜興無錫一帶銷路極佳，市氣卒被抬上。</p>
<h3>海味來源減少</h3>
<p>海味市况均吿轉機，大抵為交通有所阻棵，以致來源减少，干貝蝦尾禿參生開壯肚續升，粉絲尤為出類拔萃，各帮雖去路淸淡，而脚地依然堅硬。</p>
<h3>南華線運輸繁盛</h3>
<p>英輪運來大宗紙幣</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕南華線運輸繁盛，　昨今兩日有大批棉紗棉布雜糧分運厦門油頭廣東，招商局海皖輛昨日下午四時許出口，直駛汕頭，裝去豆餅三萬塊，豆子一千七百七十餘包，芝蔴二百十包，麥三百八十五包，疋頭十九件，棉紗三百二十餘件。太古公司湖北輪昨晨駛港，兼灘厦門，救濟署有汽車十餘輛運厦外，客貨疋頭三百餘件，豆餅一萬餘塊，豆子一千五百餘包，今日該公司牛莊輪駛廣東，大量之棉紗棉布約七千餘件之多，照目下水脚計，約在二萬萬八千萬元强，速雜貨水脚該輪此次運費總在三萬萬元强，打破中國沿海空前之運費紀錄</p>
<p>又訊，藍烟囱公司哈定頓號，昨日自英倫抵滬，聞有紙幣三百六十八箱運來。</p>
<h3>暹羅經濟建設</h3>
<p>利用餘米交換物資</p>
<p>〔聯合社曼谷廿五日電〕由於亞洲之普遍飢荒，蕞爾小國之暹羅，已一躍而為東南亞經濟前途最為光明之國家，暹羅現準備於明年儲集價値相當於一八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇鎊外債之米糧，英國正以布疋一千五百萬碼輸入暹羅，此蓋為印度以東任何亞洲國家所皆迫切需要之物資，英美軍事運輸農業及財政專家正努力設法協助該國，美國已準備以價値一五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元之卡車等軍用剩餘物資供給暹羅，六月中有鐵路車廂八百輛及車頭四十個將運抵暹羅，太平洋區負責清理剩餘物資之軍官，正努力設法供給暹羅之需要，另一方面，暹羅亦正在專家之協助下，竭力增加食糧之種植及生產。</p>
<h3>桐油產量激減</h3>
<p>戰前我桐油，獨占世界市塲。產量年　一百卅六萬公擔，現據業中人談，戰後產量僅及二三成而已。在戰爭期間，一部份桐油生產地區，因遭兵獎，而吿毀損；即未遭戰禍洗禮之產油地區，多數桐樹，顯現萎凋。推厥原因，實由於糧食價格上漲，產油地區之農民改植雜糧所致。聞以前一擔桐油，可易米穀四擔。目前僅能易一擔，故農民對桐樹之栽植興趣降低，產量乃亦大减。</p>
<p>中國桐油產　，佔世界總產量百分之九十五以上。自民國廿三年後，中國桐油出口，躍居茶葉之上，佔出口貨之首位，對國民經濟貢獻殊大。民國廿六年美國自中國進口之桐油，在一億七千四百萬磅以上。</p>

<h3>津展開科學攻勢　摧毀蝗蝻大本營</h3>
<p>— 特約紀者季紹林</p>
<p>本報廿三日天津航訊</p>
<p>天津附近的兩個產米區，一是小站，一是軍糧城，前者乃李鴻章的淮軍所開闢，後者在我們抗戰期中，日本人曾花了數年的時間，企圖把牠造成一個全盤科學化，機械化的五十萬大農塲的基幹，關於這個大農塲的情形，我想以後再作報吿。這裏，記者所記述的，是軍糧城區域最近遭遇到的一次禍害——蝗災。這次蝗災蔓及區域東西寬四十里，南北深十里，發現後，經中央農業試騐所動員了二十七位技術人員，並得到天津聯合國善後救濟總署辦事處及行政院善後救濟分署並駐津美海軍陸戰隊的協助，經過百餘日的奮鬥，終於把蝗災撲滅，以科學方法來治蝗，在這個區域裏還是第一次。</p>
<h3>蝗災源於運糧城　分兩路進襲</h3>
<p>蝗災的發生是在六月初，據事後調查，這羣小動物發源於軍糧城以北三十里的七里海湖沼草原地帶，最初牠們分兩路向南進襲，越過數十里的荒地，到達舊津塘公路附近地區，一路竄向軍糧城西二十里之張貴莊，主力則殺奔軍糧城，這時牠們又分為四路正面攻入軍糧城地帶，每路寬者達七華里，窄者也有三數里。蝗羣所到之處，地面幾乎全被這些小動物遮蔽，農作物，雯時就被啃光。</p>
<p>記者於二十二日赴災區視察，一株玉蜀黍留給我的印象最深，這株三尺許高的王蜀黍，葉子已全被吃凈，祗剩下禿禿的軀幹，像木棍似的挿在地上。就災情來說，很値得慶幸的是並未十分嚴重，因為小麥多已成熟，農民發現蝗蟲後，便搶着收割，而正當蝗　向灌溉區稻秧侵入的時候，被撲滅了。受害較甚的是秋收作物，也有一部份小麥因為收割過早，減收數成。</p>
<h3>北平專家趕津埠　展開殲滅戰</h3>
<p>北平中央農業試騐所在本月八日接到報吿，經過一度調查後，十四日由病蟲學專家劉廷蔚氏率領二十位農事學生及六位敎師，由北平來天津趕赴災區，着手防禦，並展開殲滅戰。蝗的成　，要到五齡後才能飛行，牠的　　能力可及於週圍二百里。幼蟲時代稱蝻，跳躍能力每天可前進一里，在災區最初發現者是大量的，三齡至四齡的蝻，最後幾天，有了成羣的飛蝗，據劉廷蔚先生說，蝗有一種習性，牠們常是大羣的集體行動在進行殲滅戰的時候，常利川牠這種特性，以藥餌殺蟲劑治除，但這次蝗羣進入舊津塘公路與北寗鐵路之間，這地帶溝渠縱橫，蘆葦叢生，蝗羣開始散開，對於進行殲滅戰上，這是個不利的地形。但是李代桃僵，蘆章替農作物受了災害，又該說是一個有利的地區。</p>
<h3>津美海軍陸戰隊　火攻蝗蟲窠</h3>
<p>在戰術上講：這次治蝗是同時應用了好幾個不同的辦法，主要的方法，是在農田上遍佈了藥餌，在　叢間噴洒殺蟲劑，但為了捕殺那些飛蝗，庶免二百里內其他地區復遭侵害，更動員了駐津美海軍陸戰隊，以最新式武器火焰噴射器，向飛蝗窠穴展開攻勢，聯全國善後救濟總署辦事處辦理這項交涉，立刻得到美軍當局的允許。美陸戰隊三十五名，於二十二日，携帶火焰噴射器十二具前往作戰，記者因到災區時間稍遲致未得參觀他們的戰鬥，祗能在那些戰塲上作了一番戰後的憑弔。火焰噴射器是集中於飛蝗窠聚的數處　塘，總面積約十餘畝，被燒萎的蘆葦，亂披在水上，死蝗漂在水面、顯得對那些火焰似乎毫未抵抗。據目擊者談；戰果是異常優良，其後我又在田野上巡視，藥餌隨處都有，蝗蝻遺屍也遍地皆是。和糖的砒霜石灰引誘牠們吃下肚裏去，結果是腑臟均被燒枯了，死在那裏。</p>
<h3>謹防牠捲土重來　蝗災成尾聲</h3>
<p>行政院善後救濟分署為了鼓勵農民捕殺蝗蝻，臨時訂了一個五斤蝗蝻換一斤麵粉的辦法，已經收換了一萬斤蝗蝻。這次蝗災，當也算得是一次殘酷的戰爭，現在蝗的大本營已被摧毀，蝗的主力已被擊潰。主要的五百八十畝秧田，二百畝品種試騐田，均獲保全，蝗災成為尾聲了。</p>
<p>記者曾問劉廷蔚先生，華北蝗蝻的發祥地，是那些地方，他說牠們多半發源於黃河流域冲積之三角洲地帶，有天津區，微山湖區，邳（縣）邱（縣）區，和開封區，他對於這次蝗災的展望不甚樂觀。他說：若不就發源地圖根本治除，秋後可能再發現，據說：飛蝗的鄕土觀念很濃厚，第一代的孩子雖然飛到別處去，第三代一定會飛回第一代的地方來。軍糧城也有「春南秋北」的俗諺，說牠春天自北而南，秋天自南而北，牠會不會捲土重來呢？秋後的情形是値得注意的。</p>
<h3>我空車第八大隊在東京</h3>
<p>— 朱民威</p>
<p>這是初夏，在日本厚木機塲的美軍服裝如同在上海的江灣美軍一般，着黃色卡嘰軍便服。在厚木機場也如同在上海，在昆明，在成都，用小士吉日跑來跑去，用大吉普裝物件。美國人的標準化服裝動作以及軍八魁偉的身材，柔和而也乾脆的辦事手法，把美國的實用文化傳播了全世界。</p>
<p>東京市觀光</p>
<p>一部吉普專門開過來用DDT給剛落地的B24噴洒了裏外，美國人愛用他的物資來實現他的規定，而不講虛套與情面。（你自然不可能想像騎馬去訪人，下馬後由主人命人為你洗刷一次馬的全身。）隨後問道：</p>
<p>「有人看守這架B24嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有的。我們的警戒兵留在大塲了。」</p>
<p>「那好，我們派一名M．P．替你們日夜守衛。」</p>
<p>車輛派出送錢隊長一組人到東京少校軍官是轎車，顏色是草灰色，車內是沙發，上尉以下是吉普，由厚木機塲一條碎石路向東北三十英里外的東京行。吉普車由日本人司機，轎車則是美國人司機，路上的灰塵揚起來比在巾國西部都還濃厚，不過路很平，沒有不平之處，路上兩勞的邱陵全植滿了梯田稻作，靑色遍山野，沒有一塊荒蕪、路過橫濱市區，看到這個被美機炸得破爛城市景象才又呌人想到八個月以前這兒天空與地而的惡鬥。到東京市區後，美軍把錢隊長等駛往一所華　旅館，這旅館是以前的三井洋行俱樂部，在東京地皮那麼昻貴，三井俱樂部二個花園，一共佔地十八畝，池塘石山林木與小橋，構成了市街閙聲所不及的隱境。</p>
<p>二十八日朱世明團長與戴堅師長赴名古屋盟軍總部開會，並察看中國駐日佔領軍營房。錢祖倫等一行即落在閑暇的自由訪問遊歷中。大家都是第一次到日本，而且是以戰勝國的軍八身份到佔領區來，一切都得符合美軍在這裏所造成的佔領軍風習方行，因此大家都穿上不是戰衣的軍常服，深綠色嗶嘰料子裁成的留美時代制服穿上身，出門一定按階級乘轎車，或吉普，第一個目標，當然是觀光東京市街。</p>
<p>東京市街經過九個月佔領，戰跡已不大看得到，那些市區被炸的房屋大多經過一番人工整理，雖然還留着斷牆殘壁，但並不灰燼堆積，至於馬路，更看不到炸彈坑，早已用柏油塡補光坦。汽車行到任何地方，都是平穩而不跳動，東京市街繁盛區銀座，風景區上野公園，以及附郊明治天皇墓，東鄕大將墓，都去走過。</p>
<p>深刻的印象</p>
<p>日本人的衣食住行在戰後的表現，目前並不比戰前太壞，這裏看出麥帥的手法並不是一個單純軍人辦法。麥帥在日本，軍事與重工業是不容許存在，但在維護戰敗者日本人民的生存上，這個老將軍却做着「盡量讓日本人做工，也讓日本人吃飽」，現在日本的米是官賣，人民按一定時候去買定量的米，當然這量是少於需要，但可使日本人不致餓死，另外麥帥總部使得日本大半可以開工的絲織廠，紗廠都開了工，並且為日本產品在美國找尋市塲，更以輪船運送這些日本貨去換取美洲的麵粉，好以麵包塡飽工作的日本人肚子。</p>
<p>日本人的衣裳因為是打了敗仗，所以上上下下都不講究面子而將就穿着，差不多男人在壯丁年齡都是穿的日本兵短而緊身的制服，帶着覆眉的鴨舌小窄帽，像我們在京滬以及長江沿錢所見的日俘打扮一樣，只是所有的標明階級記號都摘去。女人大多穿西服，像在上海虹口區域所常見的日本女人那樣，也有穿一種上衣連褲的飛行衣似的裝束。</p>
<p>他們自己抱定一個念顯：「打敗了仗，一切都得從頭做起，像砌屋的匠人面對遇風暴倒下的毀屋，知道艱苦歲月在前面長得很，這起點當然更苦」！他們也很寗靜，因為屋子已倒塌了，反而去了一層惟恐覆滅的惶恐，只要看「數寄屋橋」（橋名）附近他們釣魚的悠閑，就可見一斑。</p>
<p>日本人的尊嚴自然談不到，因此他們索性把面子丟掉，在中國飯店或其他日本食堂，錢祖綸他們把吃剩的一點魷魚，送給日本女食客，這些女人非常感激的收吃了。因為她們吃的是一碗白飯，能以買一枚鷄蛋佐餐，就認為是奢侈品了。</p>
<p>後來他們去遊過熱海溫泉，日本交通系統的週密以及鄉村，　地山野林木的稠密，令他們深深留下印象，中國要趕上對海這個戰敗的國家，單是這二件事，就得花上一些鍥而不捨的精神與艱辛的歲月。（十六日·上海）</p>

<h3>我也來談論國是</h3>
<p>主筆先生：鄙人目睹目前書報雜誌之左傾執筆者，立論往往歸咎於政府一方，其影響人心，至深且烈。鄙人由於愛國心之驅使，實難忍其淆惑黑白，與彼輩一論今日的國是。</p>
<p>目今一般人談到國共糾紛時，往往歸罪於國民黨。許多極端者，甚至以為國民黨有百非而無一是，而共產黨則有百是而無一非。我們稍具一點理智和良心的人，再不能容其歪曲是非，也得表明我們的意見：</p>
<p>（一）不容再拖了！——反對內戰，是舉國一致的要求。事實呢，經過多少人的調停，幾度的談判，幾次的停戰協定之後，總是停了又打，打了又停，邊談邊打，邊打邊談。這樣的談判，這樣的停戰，從勝利至今，已將十個月了，而全國人民仍然受着戰爭的苦痛，流亡不能歸家，生活不能安定，經濟恐慌，復員梗塞，人民同聲指責政府，而政府也苦悶於整個的財政預算不能平衡，經濟施策動輙受掣，歸根溯源，還不是因了全國的交通不能統一，物資不能流通，及政令不能普及之故嗎？所以在政府說來，也一定很厭惡內戰的。目前和平的大道，是共黨放下武器，政府進行改組，假如說，雙方都照此妥協，全國和平而統一，兩萬均可以民主的方式競爭政權。據目前的情勢看去，國民黨或仍可能是佔得優勢的政黨，革新圖治，不難挽回巳失的人心。而共黨旣未有取得政權的把握，乃寄其唯一的希望於使混亂局勢惡化下去，直拖到民不聊生的時候為止。那時人民對政府，再也不能信仰，對現實再也不能忍受，然後暴動者認為絕好的機會到了若此而求和平，何異緣木而求魚？—因此，我們向大家呼籥時局再不容再拖了，須在最短的期限內，解决全　問題。</p>
<p>（二）東北即應整個接收。接收東北，基於開羅協定，也基於中蘇條約，基於政府自九一八以来的一貫政策，也基於全國一致的要求。所以只有今日內外公認的政府，接收東北主權，是名正言順天經地義的事。如有任何人企圖强佔東北，就是圖謀不軌。經渦我們唇敝舌焦的呼籥，友邦義正詞嚴的聲援，好容易一蘇軍撤退東北，正常國軍去接收的時候，偏偏共產黨假借人民的名義，强佔了東北，阻碍政府行使主權，這種不顧國家大局的行為，我們為什麼還要容忍？共黨荒謬的理論中，同他們借用「民主」和「自由」的意義一樣，有所謂「人民的主權」和「人民的武力。」稍具知識的人，都知道他們濫用了主權的意義，此處可無庸辨釋。祗問這「人民的武力」是從何處來的？敵偽盤據之時，未聞也；蘇軍進兵之時，亦未聞也；恰在國軍接收的時候，才從地下出來，未免認錯目標了！我們除要求政府即刻接收整個東北以外、更不能承認任何新的偽組織的政權和武力。</p>
<p>（三）給馬帥以公斷權。—誰是最公正的，當然是人民，然而人民的意見實在太多了，而真正多數人民的意見則很難聽到。至於馬帥，當然有人會攻擊他是美國人，然而在這混沌的局面中，比較站在是非　外的旁觀者，也只有美國人了。那麽美國又為什麽要關心中國的局勢呢？因為現在世界大勢，唯有中國和平，遠東才有和平，唯有中國强盛世界才能安定，況亂的中國，會醞釀為戰爭之泉源，衰弱的中國，為强鄰之所垂涎，所以美國人關心中國的利益，也就是關心美國本身之利益，美國人企求本身之安全，間接也須使得中國安全。由於此，我們乃承認馬帥為一够資格之調解者。「政治民主化，軍隊國家化，」是國人的主張，同時也是馬帥提出和解的條件。我們旣同意馬帥的地位，也同意馬帥的主張，那麽為避免拖延起見，須得給馬帥以公斷的權力。「政協」之後，共黨藉口二中會議不利於彼，趁馬帥回國當兒，在東北强佔畏春，在華北破壞停戰協定，乃演成今日的局面。至於政府是否企圖毀約，還只是共黨估計而已，而共黨則眞正先毀約了！　在何方？自有公論。大槪共黨之所以尙不願接受馬帥的公斷，也在乎此。</p>
<p>（四）共黨何以要攻擊盟邦？—共黨說美國干涉中國內政，妨害中國主權，並大聲疾呼「美軍退出中國」等等。這些論調，很易使人衝動，可是仔細一想，這不就是共黨拒絕接受馬帥公斷權及攻擊美軍為政府運兵之側而攻勢嗎？茲對此申論如後：（一）美國調停我國內戰，誰也不能否認這不是干涉我國內政，我們甘願如此的理由，除如前章所說以外，唯有痛切自責，刻骨銘心而已！國家現在已弄到如此地步，試問捨此下策外，還有他法麽？（二）至於美國妨碍中國主權，則不知何所指而云然。除了我們自願給他公斷權以外，似乎尙無類似蘇聯在東北的情形發生，乃共黨不責彼而責此，未免太不分輕重了！（三）美軍駐華的工作為遺俘及助理中國接收主掖，這二者恐怕還算後者重要。現在日軍固已受降完舉，然而東北尙成問題，老實說，美國不願東北成為東亞巴爾幹。美軍的駐華，目前，正是一種安定力量。除了別具用心的共黨外，沒有人討厭美軍此時的駐華。（四）共黨又說美軍為政府運兵，足以擴大內戰。我們想假使政府沒有收復長春，根本連談判的餘地都沒有。似使沒有美人為我運兵，別說接收東北，怕連華北也休想踏入一步！那時的局面，豈堪設想？我們得承認事實，正由於靑島大津等地的駐紮美軍，所以才沒有使華北內戰擴大；由於東北國軍力量的加强，才留下了今日談判的地步。假如美軍為政府運兵是錯誤的話，那麼共黨也請想想「東北聯軍」是怎樣成立的？如無此始作俑者，在東北根本就不能發生國共問題。共黨如此厚責於人，雜責於已，天下人不盡是可欺的</p>
<p>最後，籥請左傾的知識份子們注意，你們攻擊美軍武裝了政府軍，如何却還逼着政府承認蘇軍在東北所武裝的匪徒呀？你們攻擊政府對談判未有誠意，却為何讓共軍猖獗於東北而又在山東各地發動戰事啊？你們片面的論斷，只助長了共黨的氣熖，於國於民，絲毫無補！</p>
<p>這是什麽時候？這是什麼世界？請求知識份子拿出良心來，認淸事實，別再為野心家吶喊助威了！魏伯翹，六，廿。</p>
<h3>從遼陽到四平　七日四平航訊</h3>
<p>— 關榮欽</p>
<p>七日四平航訊</p>
<p>和少數友人匆匆握別，記者坐着馬車趕到火車站去搭下午二時班車。在遼腸，居留了四十多天。要是預知要待這麽久的話，必然會煩躁起來。可是，說起要走，記者又有點不捨。老實說，記者是不喜愛遼陽那五步一處，十步一座的障碍物和防禦工事。却是喜愛遼陽那障碍物和防禦工事以外的好些東西。不錯，遼陽出過幾個「鼎鼎大名」的漢奸，如于冲漢。袁金凱之流，他們以東北同胞血汗建築的大厦——于家·袁家·還巍然站在這古老的山城，抹去了不少山城的色澤，可是抹不掉她先天的美好。</p>
<p>滿眼綠油油　有田不得種</p>
<p>健康地聳立西站的唐塔，牠挨過了多少的風雨冰雪的剝蝕！百年又百年，看來還是那麼「老當益壯」！又看那也是掛滿了歷史的皺紋的文廟：孔老夫子和「七十二賢」的牌位的周遭庭院，那處不掛着鋪着綠茵茵的草木？也許是由於牠靜悄悄站在城東的一角，遊人就少，踏進廟門，要不是你穿着咯咯叫的革履的話，你準會連蒼蠅飛蚊子呌的聲音也聽得到。其幽美處恰好與車聲轔轔塵飛沙舞的街道，成個絕好的對照。還有，也是站在城東的武廟——關帝廟，魁星樓，牠們的周圍不錯是佈滿了工事，鐵絲網，電網之類，象徽着不安的東西，可是，你也不會忘記，遼陽委實是遼寧省建城最早的縣城，連瀋陽也不及它的歷史的悠久。</p>
<p>從遼陽北上，（僅能到四平街，）和從遼陽南下一樣：鐵路沿綫，滿眼是綠油油的草木，臨風招展，一回想起兩個月前的情景，將使你有飄入另一世界之感。為着防匪破壞交通，當局早就下過令：這裏的鐵道兩旁五裏內，不准種禾。一邊五甲，兩邊相加就是十里。這得請管鐵道的人算一算，看看東北不能種木的土地一共有多少？在　饉閙得人獸相食的國度裏，居然還有有田不得種的現象，除非傻子聽到才不覺得怪！</p>
<p>幾個大站頭　路軌如蛛綱</p>
<p>從遼陽到四平，得經過好幾個大站：就是蘇家屯。瀋腸。鐵嶺和開原，蘇家屯地方是不大，可是蘇家屯火車站，却是我國第一，世界第三，其大可想而知。牠是否有這麼大，還得查查，我只知到站時從軍廂窗眼望出去，就看到平列着密密的路軌，看個眼疲神倦，也看不盡頭。瀋陽自然也是個大站，不過平列着的路軌却不及蘇家屯之多。鐵嶺也算大站。從遼陽到瀋陽一百八十里，從瀋陽到鐵嶺是一百二十里。據說：從前鐵嶺也是個工廠區。不過，這「前任工廠區」的縣城，給記者的印象僅是近郊一些空光光的大房子，外表巍然，可是從黑焦焦的窗子看進去，一點也想不到牠們原來是工廠。要不是預先有人吿訴我：我將懷疑那些房子是鬼屋，給怕鬼的人們燒過了。鐵嶺市內，街道還整齊，兩旁都有綠樹，很有規則地站立着。日僑舊貨攤佔了兩三條大街，那邊人潮似海浪，老在擠來擠去。</p>
<p>開原分兩城　相距十八里</p>
<p>從鐵嶺到開原才六十里，火車一小時就到達。開原分新舊二城，其間相距十八里。新城較舊城強多多，這當然是因為日僑住宅區在新城之故。新開原是前次國軍攻四平打西豐等地的立脚點，目能國軍雖然已前進得遠遠了；可是還留下好些後方補給站。給這些「站」裝威風的是堡壘和鐵絲網。開原新城的市街是齊整的不過因為復員不易，好些地方還找不到端緒。舉個例來說：這裏的土地戶籍册簿，為撤退的八路帶走，產權糾葛多所不淸，往往得憑縣長或財政科長等人去處分。留居的日僑，漸次撤回本國或聚居一地，空下來的整潔住宅，有的因為目前的鐵路員工佔居，有的則用木板釘封着門窗，木板的上面則貼着「××警官住宅」或「××隊附住宅」之類的字條。沒有撤離的日僑繼續出賣帶不走的衣物，便宜東西不少，可是一過投機者的手，便市價數倍了。畫籍還是賤，五元一斤，買者寥寥。有些日人不想書籍落我同胞手中，就付之一炬。好些學生分組巡邏，專索將被投入火堆的書，以充實他們學校圖書館。</p>
<p>戰火已靜熄　地雷還在響</p>
<p>瀋日段客車，於六月一日通車了。記者在五月廿八日就從開原坐軍用專車到四平。</p>
<p>四平和東北其他城市一樣，分兩個區域：邊是日僑區，另一邊是「滿」人區。建築，衛生，兩個區域都大不相同。站在又高又長的「大橋」一望：西就是日僑區，東就是「滿」人區。前者稱「道西」，後者稱「道東」。道東有高大的建築，街道齊整寬敞而平坦，街邊有高可數丈的錄樹。現在是「住亂」了，地方還是整潔。道西則少有高大的建築，街道雖然還整齊，可是連石子路也不易找到。溝渠不淸，穢物處處，樹木沒有，低給妓館則觸目皆是。戰火已熄，已大半個月了，可是共軍埋下的地雷，還日夜在「轟轟」的呌着。作戰期間，平民無辜死去的，據說有數百人。散步街頭，城郊，不時還聞到屍臭，聽到哀訴，那燒得只賸下個黑焦焦的骨架的火車站，那千孔百瘡的近郊建築物，尤為人們所不忘。</p>
<p>訪省府要人　談復員現狀</p>
<p>記者為着明瞭當地復昌現狀，曾去拜訪地方當局：首先去拜訪省府劉主席。不巧得很，他却因公外出，只得投刺請見民政廳廳長張式綸氏。日理萬機的張廳長，接見記者時像是那麽的安閒，登時就給我一個異常深刻的印象。張廳長說：省府是五月十八日遷返四平的，一到，馬上就辦公。本來，省府布本年一月八日已接收完畢，可是蘇軍撤退後，共軍馬上來搶。省府指揮下的保安隊，曾不顧兵力的薄弱，武器的窳劣，起而抵抗，從三月十二打到三月十七日，終以實力縣殊而退守了。共算犧牲了七百人，傷者近千，省府劉主席以下人員，泰半被俘。打這一回雖說是敗仗，可是以省府本身武力單獨抵抗共軍，却是光復後的東北的破題兒。談到共軍之所以要死搶四平，死守四平，張廳長說有三個原因：第一，他們看到東北問題，政府勢將由政治談判方式以求解決，為着增强他們在談判席上的力量，就得在四平，長春幾個大地方拚死打一塲，好表現表現自己的實力；第二，四平是東北的要衝，是東北政治上與軍事上的關節，據之，可以打斷北上的國軍的聯絡，幷策應長春及其附近的共軍；第三，四平仍有敵偽殘留下來的物資，他們想着要掠奪。談起省府內部工作人員問題，張廳長說荐任級以上的，多來自後方，委任級以上的，則多取材當地：這幷不是用人有彼此之分，而是由於常地人員（其中有不少是大學生）在偽滿時代，很少有過比較重要的工作的經騐。說到各縣接收和治安情形時，張廳長說：遼北各縣都已接收完畢了惟有通遼一縣，則以治安欠佳，權設縣府於遼寗省境內。各縣的治安都無多大間題。最後談到接收問題，張廳長說，所謂接收，不過是那麼幾幢半破半整的房子，物資則少之又少。</p>
<p>不過，據楊市長的答復是：「做，總得去做；即使做得慢吧，也較停着不動好。我們得創造環境」！</p>

<h3>問糧貸案</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>糧貸案還在偵訊期中，時日已遷延得很久，老百姓們雖然很焦急，希望早日有個水落石出，但想到司法的進行程序，總要調查明白，證據確鑿，才可以定　，所以還能耐着性子。</p>
<p>然而以為用拖的辦法，可以把大事拖成小事，小事拖成無事，那就錯了：老實說，這次糧貸案倘不能辦個一淸二楚，其後的影響，眞不知伊於胡底了？</p>
<p>現在街頭巷尾，由竊竊私議而大聲嚷叫的大有人在，他們說：偽組織那樣黑暗貪汚的時期，還辦了一椿后大椿的案子，大快人心，抗戰勝利了，在國民政府一貫厲行剷除貪汚政策之下，相信決不會含糊了事的。</p>
<p>令人由納罕而疑慮的，是兩個機關在搶辦這件案子，對此，我們倒不一定堅決主張交給哪一個機關辦，法院也好，警備司令部也好，但有一個原則，却是我們所堅持的，那就是必須公開，必須秉公處理！</p>
<p>昨天汪任兩糧官已解到警備司令部，據說偵訊時，在若干糧商及汪達人的口供中，曾涉及糧食部及部長徐堪各點，軍法處業已去函糧部調查眞相，惟尙未接獲復文。</p>
<p>我們建議警備司令部，應一該即日傳訊徐堪及糧食部有關人員，我們知道去年重慶的黃金舞弊案，財政部部長兪鴻鈞即被傳到過法庭，到庭作證，所以我們相信徐部長一定會挺身而出，使這件案子的偵訊工作早日得以完成，否則，人們又將怎樣想法呢？</p>
<h3>關於龍華會</h3>
<p>— 楊鴻年</p>
<p>馬皇帝出走絕非事實</p>
<p>在天津那樣的都市要，居然能讓這所謂「一心大道龍華聖敎總會」在光復後照例的存在着，這不能不說當局的寬大。本報十七日載，八日天津航訊，雖然描寫的很詳細，但多着眼於戰時，及光復後，過去的情形，很少着眼，故願將所知公開一下，以響讀者。</p>
<p>戰前的天津市，是所謂特殊化區域，尤其是日本租界，更充分的利用時機，來製造這「特殊化」總樞。日本浪人，特務機關，無時不在利用這一般狼子野心家在扮着各樣面孔，來替他做些麻醉人民的勾當。但說起來，這「龍華會」的起源，郤遠在山東長山島。所謂「馬皇帝」，也就是島上的一個大戶。不曉得受什麼人的慫恿，他居然在這小村裏做起迷夢。起先確是變賣了自己家產，作些急公好義的善事。同時山東人，正在為了韓復渠的「淸鄕」，而抱怨着因為韓復渠以「以毒攻毒」的政策，利用一般匪首，做淸剿的領導人，所以，難免有些狐假虎威的事情。「馬皇帝」也就利用這一機會，大量的拉進不少信徒，進入他這敎門的人。這些敎徒必須先將全部家產捐作敎產，這樣才使財當平均。叩其一律的待遇，也確使忠心於他的人逐漸增多。慢慢地，他的野心開展，由村而鎭，由鎮而縣，這樣使他毫不費力佔據了整個長山。這時候，日本特務份子，大量接濟軍火，並派人協助，指揮，所以「馬皇帝」的威名，在山東竟會應過韓復渠。如果有人還記得韓復渠在山東的「夜不關門」政策，他為了淸剿「土皇帝」也不能說沒有功績。但這功績的後半節是留給日本人的。像利用溥儀似的，日本人看「馬皇帝」不能立足山東，特地派一條運輪艦，將他接到大連，後又接來天津日本租界。大約在民十八年，在桃山街，須磨街轉角處，才掛起這「一心天道龍華聖敎會」黃旗。另外還有一旗上書「真大靈山活的」語頗費解。前旗之一字，寫成—，另外並有一旗稱之為「真主」及應改年月歷書等邪說。這時他的敎徒們，大多係四十餘歲者，（其中亦有十餘歲者祗數人），衣藍布道袍，左襟，布鞋，布襪，留辮，千篇一律。少聞其誦經，黃昏時多站門外，對過街暗娼，打情駡俏，頗不乏人。</p>
<p>廿六年國軍南撤，天津淪陷，該會會首，曾率徒衆，結隊遊行術頭，而自行安座「別克」轎車穩　其後。作類似呼號之聲，而不辯其究係何語，頗使人疑其非人。後該會佔據南市大舞台，亦曾利用開辦粥廠，遍地寫捐，凡大商店，及士紳均被訂有捐額，實則利用權勢，而非善舉也。報載陶雲祥稱：「馬皇帝已於廿四年出走」恐非確實或有意掩護也。其誇耀興辦慈善事業掩護地下工作人員猶滿口雌黃。如果該會也能掩護地下工作人員，日本特務機關也許更便利些了！總之，這並非是什麼左道邪敎，而是有十足政治作用的一個組織，希望當局注意。同時，更望天津市民檢舉，過去的一切，能有更多的檢舉，才能使當局更好於處理，故將所聞錄之。</p>
<h3>論「小紅」</h3>
<p>— 曹作漢</p>
<p>曾有做索引的考據家說：「紅樓夢中的小紅，是影射明朝的漢奸淸朝的功狗那位兩朝大員洪承疇。」我非胡顧之門徒，對此話不便置一辭。不過，如此比擬，總有點委屈小紅，也覺得有點委屈洪承疇。</p>
<p>「人　望高處爬，水向低處流，」原是世俗　情。試看小紅在怡紅院的時候，祗是做些外圍工作，幹些外房子內的粗生活，寶二爺的身邊事，都由襲人晴雯麝朋秋紋等人做了；還有其他的老媽媽大丫頭之類，把一個核心包圍得堅騰騰的。沒有機會登堂入室去親近主子，自得不到主十的信愛，奴才們如得不到主子的信愛，又怎麽能在奴才中走紅，而壓倒別個奴才。何况小紅又是個搔首弄姿，自顧不凡的人，如何能安於無聲無色的默默無聞的境遇。</p>
<p>為了不辜負自己的才華，她在等待着表現自己的機會，以冀派點「竄頭勢」。正如剛拿着文憑的學士碩士之類，總想能够敲開社會的大門，沐猴而冠一翻，這心情很可原諒的。</p>
<p>可惜小紅的命不逢時，機會很少，難得有一次乘虛的踏入核心，向寳二爺獻了點慇懃兒，郤又很快的給寶二爺左右的親信奴才排擠而去，晴雯還對她連諷帶駡的兜頭澆上一盆冷水，她仍然被轟回外圍了。</p>
<p>這在心高志大的她，如何能够忍受？所以一得到鳳姐的靑睞，馬上就樂效犬馬之勞的爬上高枝兒。換了個實力派的主兒，總算是克達初志了，雖然仍未滿足兒女私情。</p>
<p>洪承疇呢，情形可就不同。他原是明朝的國家大臣，皇帝對之又異常的親信，一般人也望之為國家的干城，如其欲竭盡忠忱的話，是有無限度的機會來發揮他自已的才能，皇帝不會委屈他的才華的。但是他却倒戈降敵，做了皇帝的叛徒，做了民族的漢奸，把明朝的錦綉山河，送給了異族。</p>
<p>因此兩者相較，洪承疇可說是君子中的小人，眞小人似比偽君子可愛，所以小紅似比洪承疇高明一點。</p>
<p>小紅不像洪承疇，那麼她像誰呢？</p>
<p>如不顧「效顰」之譏，我說：她很像民元以來的失意政客落伍的軍閥。</p>
<p>試展討一下民元以來的國內斫殺史，至北伐完成前止，每一役的興風作浪，實際有些什麼意義，値得你死我活的爭個不休，但，却又不斷的鬥爭斫殺，祗是幾個自負才華不甘冷漠的野心家，在求一味的表現自己而已。</p>
<p>今日上台，明日下野；今日聯甲，明日倒乙；有奶就是娘；此處不留爺，自由留爺處；五花八門的攪得天昏地暗，祗是幾個不安於奴才命運的奴才在挑撥攪鬼而已。這一篇胡塗帳，祗有他們才能算得明白。</p>
<p>然而，小紅似還較他們強點，所以精明強幹的鳳姐才加以賞識，一篇「奶奶太太」帳，李紈都給攪得頭昏，她却水銀瀉地似的說得頭頭是道；不甘於冷落，似也不可苛責。</p>
<p>祗是沒有才能而又不甘冷落的人，將怎樣呢？結果是害了別人又毀了自已，民元以來的政客與軍閥就是一個例；所以我深為無小紅之才能而有小紅的抱負的人危懼。</p>
<h3>三層樓看客</h3>
<p>— 儲蘭夫</p>
<p>名票名伶演義戲的第一天，彷彿是一個衝動，下午四點半，我就趕到天蟾門口。出乎意外的鐵門早已拉上，人們都在那武裝警衛的帶着幾分尊嚴的鐵門外面擠軋着，塞滿了整個的馬路。最性急的人，擴在前面，抓住那鐵的欄千，不肯放鬆。張大着嘴，注視裏面，有如久禁的囚徒，在鐵窗裏面渴望自由一樣—這些人都是跟我一樣，三層樓看客，祗有二千元的購買力。</p>
<p>我不覺噓了一口氣望門興歎，打算回去。一面悔恨自己太遲了點；一面却又阿Q地為自己的二千元慶幸。正在猶疑，却碰到一位曾在這個劇院裏看後門的朋友。他瞧我道付勁兒，就說：「別走，停會我送你上去！」可巧那鐵門又開了一綫，於是那朋友就拉了我，趁着人潮一湧而進。我們並不是走的正路，正路上可了不起，查票的地方有武裝帮着，誰沒有票，攆出來。我們算是走了私。</p>
<p>不曉得是怎樣走的，總之我跟這朋友到了三樓看戲的地方，可了不得！整個的樓上已經擠了二分之一以上的人，那進口的地方，還在不斷的涌進來。急急忙忙，我在第五排上占了一個位置。看看鐘，才五點的樣子，冷冰冰的台上，豎着一塊又像客氣又像諷刺的吿牌—「八時開演，」！望下看，正廳和二樓都是很整齊的空着一排排的坐椅，一個人也沒有。</p>
<p>而我們的地方却變成了熱閙的海。女招待們忙着泡茶，「謝謝你……」邊喊着，邊軋來軋去。賣零食的哭喪着臉托着他的貨盤，因為他給人擠得不能動彈。拼命給人留着位置的人，跟後進來的打算佔用的人紅着報項吵架。三四個人爭着拿一架望遠鏡向空的舞台瞧…空中迷漫着烟霧，揚溢着各色嘈雜的音響閙成一片。我自幸得了一個位置，跟前座的一位中年人撩天。「你來遲了，我是一點半就來了！」他彷彿很滿意自已的位置，打着上海官話對我說。</p>
<p>「好大的毅力！」我不覺贊歎起來。其實，我的毅力何嘗小？從五點到八點，在這個熱閙而又寂寞的海中堅持了三小時，自己也不知是怎樣打發的。凡是三樓看客—誰的毅力都不算小。</p>
<p>未開演前的　鼓聲，也激起了人們的彩聲，戲以「大旱之雲霓」的可愛姿能進行起來。「打漁殺家」很給我以感動，那漁夫和他的女兒，給惡勢力逼得去殺人的場面，是够深刻的；舊劇裏這樣的戲不很多。這戲演過，舞台上陸續出現了許多特別看客，道些人一例的整齊漂亮摩登，他們瀟洒文雅的舉止，和輕鬃閑散的神態，和我們這輩人比起來，眞有「天上人間」之感。</p>
<p>戲在進行了，然而我却給這些高等人引誘去了大部分的注意。一位高大的紳士給了我更大的趣味，仙使我記起了一篇報紙上論人的面形的幽默文字。那作者說：「奇形怪狀者是貴相，有許多貴人或富人確係是豬形的。」這位紳士有力的證明了那位作者的意見。</p>
<p>戲很快的收了場，隨着人潮擠出劇場，整百輛的汽車，停滿了幾條馬路，等着迎接它們的主人。在車輛的夾縫裏，拖着十二分疲乏的身體，我盤算着，什麼時候才會有一個合理的藝術欣賞塲所。</p>

<h3>迷於女人　敗於女人</h3>
<p>— 馮憶</p>
<p>論金磚案主犯陳元盛的犯罪心理，不外生活靡亂，見財起意，於是最初迷於女人，最後亦是敗於女人，酒色財氣四字害了他的一生，常他被捕的一剎那，猶在把壼獨酌，未料到「以酒澆愁愁更愁」，禍已臨顯。</p>
<p>論到陳之年紀，正當三十而立，一生中的黃金時代，不幸自己不會利用自己「無限的黃金」，而一門心思想抄捷徑，發橫財，結果偷了國庫「有限的黃金」，終至身　囹圄。如果想到一失足成千古恨，再回頭已百年身的兩句老話，陳常不勝感槪。如此說來，陳之腦筋組織，似嫌簡單，正所謂自作聰明，反被聰明誤！</p>
<p>再觀乎陳於案發後，在杭蘇嘉一帶，尋花問柳，日夜與女人鬼混，硬充闊少，現出一副滿不在乎的神氣，正所謂色不迷人人自迷，想不到到了佛門聖地靈隱寺前，猶未點破迷夢。袋裏的金條落在山溝裏，還勸人性命要緊，不要下去檢，如果我佛有靈，亦將不免唸道：「空即是色，色即是空」，阿彌陀佛！</p>
<p>短短尋歡一月，到頭來飽嘗鐵窗風味，不免受盡牢中烏氣，為陳着想，未免付的代價太大。酒色財氣，可不愼哉！</p>
<p>瀋陽報載：「瀋陽人買報，十分之八九並非為讀報而買報，大多數人都是以紙張的好壞和多寡作為置報的標準，是不管報紙內容好壞的」。其實上海人買報又何嘗不然，我疑心美國的紐約時報與紐約每日新聞銷數百萬份，是不是亦與日出十歲大張有關？</p>
<p>馮玉祥將軍這次從重慶到南京，捨機而登舟，到南京之後，不談政治而專談水經，似乎對水發生了大大的興趣。這大槪是由於受命出國考察水利而引起的一點靈感。據說馮氏曾說：「中國的問題，祗是水利問題，蔣主席治黃河，我來治長江，兩個地方治好，中國也治好了。」</p>

<h3>讀書無用論</h3>
<p>— 危言</p>
<p>近來常聽見一般靑年學生們設：「國事險惡到這般地步，讀畫有甚麽用處」？又在某大學的牆上看見一幅漫畫，畫着一本畫上面放着幾個骷髏頭。靑年們在習慣上已經是不大要讀書，現在更得到了理論上的支持。於是他們就在道種「愛國至上，讀書無用」的口號下正式與書本宣告脫離關係，踏上了政治的征途。這是中國敎育界戰後的現象。</p>
<p>據炎國新聞處華盛頓廿三日常科學硏究發展處以大批科學文件移交與國會圖書館，以之免費分贈全美國各大學以及各圖書館。這種文件都是科學硏究發展處戰時偉大硏究計劃的結晶。其間包括物理雷達無綫電設備，火箭，化學，光學，電氣交通，海底作戰等。這種報吿文件對於科學家，敎育家，及各部門實業家，將大有貢戲。這可以代表美國學術界在戰後動態的一斑。</p>
<p>在這兩種情形對照之下，我們可以看得出來，人家是希望以科學建國，因為要替科學建國打基礎，他們要普遍的研究這些科學報吿文件。而在我國領導靑年的先生們似乎在希望以政治建國，因為要替政治建國打基礎，於是他們忙着指揮靑年學生寫標語，遊行示威。我們倒幷不一定是不贊成學生參加政治活動，我們也知道政洽不上軌，一切的其他的發展都是要受到阻礙的。不過我們要請今日靑年的領導者注意三件事。第一，請你們要矯正道種讀書無用論的思想，指導靑年們多讀點書。因為沒有見識的行為是盲目的。第二，請你們注意靑年們在學識和能力上的發展應是多方面，而不要只是機械的灌輸一點政治上的主義，我們特別要希望靑年們多注意科學上的研究報吿，為中國的工業化，打下一個很好的基礎。第三，在你們指導靑年們讀書的時候你們的目的在帮助他們追求眞理而幷不是向他們傳敎。</p>
<p>最復，我引用高爾基的一段話獻給中國愛好活動的靑年們：</p>
<p>『愛好書籍吧，它會使你的生活變得更加容易；它將會友愛地帮助你辨明思想感情與各種事件的多樣而複雜的混淆；它會敎你去尊敬別人和你自己；它會用對於世界和對於人類的愛而替你的理智和心靈上插上翅膀。</p>
<p>讓它和你的信仰作對吧，假如它是用對於人類的愛和願望人們生活得美好些的心意而真誠地寫出來的話，——那末這就是一本好的書』！</p>
<h3>評中國政治思想史</h3>
<p>— 趙震</p>
<p>（第一册）蕭公權著　商務印書館出版</p>
<p>凡讀過蕭公權政治學上的多元論（Hsiao　Kung－chuan：Political　Pluralism　A　Strudy　in　Contimporary　Political．Theory．N．H．Harcourt　London，1927）的人，對於蕭公權都有很高的期待。政治學上的多元論是卓越的博士論文，列在國際心理哲學與科學　書中出版到現在，將近二十年了。在這幾年中他似乎很沈寂，除了在淸華學報英文天下月刋中偶或見其文章外，我們很少機會得見其著作。最近蕭公權在商務出版了他的新著中國政治思想史了，這是一部很値得注意的好書。關於中國的政治思想史，坊間所流行的已不在少數，但它們都有一個共同的毛病，就是它們都是站於某一個偏狹的觀點上，斤於爭辯思想家的階級，身份；學說的唯心唯物；東抄一句，西摘一段，幾如善博者之「呼盧成盧，喝雉成雉」。至於能把握一個思想家的整個思想體糸，而作融會貫通的「述學」著作，那就只有蕭公權的新中國政治思想史了。蕭氏的這本書「叙述各家思想，力守客觀之態度，偶有論評，亦意在辨明其歷史上之地位，非敢任意抑揚，臆斷得失。」</p>
<p>全書共分五編，計廿五章。第一編封建天下之政治思想—創造期，第二編專制天下之政治思想（上）—因襲期，第三　專制大下之政治思想（下）—轉變期。（上）第四編近代國家之政治思想（上）—轉變期（下）。第五編近代國家之政治思想（下）成熟期。</p>
<p>著者之分此五編，並非偶然的，是有原則的。著者（甲）按照思想演變之大勢，把二千多年的中國政治思想分為四大階段：（一）創造時期—孔子至泰之統一中國，為時的三百年，通稱先秦時代。（二）因襲時期—自秦漢至宋元，為時約一千六百年。（三）轉變時期——自明初至清初，為時約五百年。（四）成熟時期—自三民主義之成立以迄于今。著者（乙）再按照思想發生之歷史背景（政治史）在，而劃分為下列之三時期：（一）封建天下之思想，包括春秋戰國時代，與上述之創造時期相當。（二）專制天下之思想，包括秦漢至明淸之二千年，與因襲時期及轉變時期之前部相當。（三）近代國家之思想，包括淸末維新運動及辛亥革命以迄於今，與綠轉變時期之後部及「成熟時期」相常。把甲，乙兩種分期合而觀之，則成上述之五編了。本人書第一册即專門闡述先秦時代的政治思想。</p>
<p>著者以為中國政治思想有一共同特點，即以「天下」為對象，「天下觀念之含義略近歡洲中世初期之世界帝國」。中國古人缺乏列國並存的國際觀念，抱「政治唯我論」之見解。還有一個特　是大同主義，「忽略族類之區分，重視文化之同異」，其結果遂致二千年間，中國勢盛，則高唱「用夏變夷」之理論，外族入主，則遷就政治屈服之事實，祗須征服者行中國「先王之道」，同化於我，則北面稱臣，承認異類之政權，亦毫不愧恨」。這是證明中國人只有「文化偏見」，沒有「種族偏見」。「總上所舉各端，一言以蔽之曰：缺乏近代國家之觀念而已。……所謂近代國家至少其有下列之數特點：（一）樹立民族自主之政權，（二）承認列國並存，彼此交互之關係，（三）尊法律，重制度，而不偏賴人倫道德以為治……（四）擴充人民參政權利一端，亦可認為近代國家特點之一。此四種品性，吾國當專制天下之時期固完全缺乏，即在封建犬下之分割時期〔即先秦時代〕，亦僅略有痕迹，似是而非。二千年政治思想之醞釀衝激，不能產生近代國家之觀念一。　結何在，很可使人猛省。</p>
<p>著者認為晚周政治思想所以發達、巧由於「社會組織之迅速變遷，與偉大思想家之適生其會。」晚周是封建天下轉為專制天下之過渡時期，在此過渡時期，「政治思想之可能態度不外三種：（一）對將逝之舊制度表示留　，而圖有以維持或恢復之，（二）承認現狀，或有意無意中迎合未來之新趨勢而為之張目，（三）對於一切新舊之制度均感厭惡，而偏重個人之自足與自適。……儒墨兩家同屬第一類，法家諸子屬第二類，道家之老莊及一切「為我」之思想家，獨善之隱君子，則皆屬於第三類。先秦之主要學派是儒墨道法，這四家就其政治思想言之，可分為三大派：「一日人治派，儒墨屬之」；「二曰法治派，法家為其代表」；「人治與法治二派，皆為積極之政治思想。其取消極態度而並與二派對立者，則為道家所代表之無治派」。</p>
<p>關於各家學說發生之先後，著者認為「今日文戲之不足，此實為一甚難之事。然考證先秦學派之先後，其途有二：一為發源之先後，一為成立之先後。」照這樣說法，中國思想史上所聚訟不決的老子的年代問題，就可以迎刃而解了。著者說：「本書於道學之淵源，及老聃之降生，姑從舊說，假定其在孔子之前；老子成書，則從多數學者之說，假定其在孟子之後。」</p>
<p>著者以為孔子之成就，為「根據舊聞，樹立一士君子什進致用之學術，復以此學術授之平民，而培養一以知識德能為主之新統治階級。」「孔子政治思想之出發點為從周，其實行之具體主張則為「正君」，以今語釋之，正名者按盛周對建天下之制度，而調整君臣上下之權利與義務之謂。」「孔子所謂仁，乃推自愛之心以愛人之謂：「孔子言仁，實已冶道德，人倫，政治於一爐，致人，己，家，國於一貫。」「孔子之治術有三，曰養，曰敦，曰治」「養敎之工具為「德」「禮」，治之工具為「政」「刑」。「德禮為主，政刑為助。」孔子認為國家之目的不僅在養民，且在敎化人民，在化民成俗。化民成俗的方法是（一）「以身作則」，（二）「以道誨人」。著者以為「孔子思想中之「政」，不僅與近代學者所論者不同，且與古希臘柏拉屬之說亦有區別。近代論政治之功用者不外治人與治事之二端。孔子則持「政者正也」之主張，認定政治之主要工作乃在化人，非以治人，更非治事。故政治與敎育同功，君長與師傳共職。……柏拉圖亦以道德為國家之最高境界，其「哲君」之理想亦近於孔子政敎貫通，君師合一之主張。然柏拉圖之哲君為一尙智之哲人，孔子之君師為一尙德之仁者。君師以德化人，哲君以智治國，其為人與操術俱不相同。」著者認為儒家政治思想之特點是「以敎為政」，「以個人道德之發展為政治之最高理想。」所以其治術雖禮義與刑法兼用，而仍以禮義為主。</p>
<p>著者講孟，荀，墨，老，莊，管，商，韓諸子，政治思想，亦有許多深刻，精微，獨到的見解。我們為篇幅所限，不能一一介紹給讀者，不過從上面所引關於孔子的許多論斷裏，亦可略見其一斑了。照我們的看法，本書有下列的好處：（甲）立論之平實謹嚴——本書措辭極沈靜，沒有過火的言詞，沒有誇張的論調，凡是想在本書中尋求精神上的刺激（Intellectual　Excitement）的人，不免要覺其平淡無奇而失望的。（乙）剖析義理之精微——著者對於各種學說之貌似相同而實相非者，剖別極為精細。例如先秦的法治思想與近世歐洲的法治思想，初看之似乎差不多一樣，其實都是不同的。著者說得好：「歐洲法治思想之眞諦在視法律為政治組織中最高之權威。……故法　高於君權，而君主受法律之拘束。……其與吾國先秦「法治」思想以君為主體而以法為工具者如兩極之相背。」又如道法二家初視之亦近似，其實很不同。「黃老論治之要點，無過於淸淨無為，法家諸子固亦時發其義。……管子日「虛無無形之謂道」，「名正法備則聖人無事」，凡此諸語，若置之道德經中、，未必覺其不類。」然而著者認為道法之異至少有三大端：（一）無為之方術不同。法家之致無為，「則欲由明法飭令，重刑壹敎之方法以臻「明君無為於上，羣臣竦懼乎下」之境界，其操術正為老子所說「其次畏之」之第三流政治。…老子以放任致無為，申韓以專制致無為」。（二）無為之目的不同。「黃老之無為，其目的在立淸靜之治以保人民之康樂；法家諸子則敎君主行無為之法術，以鞏固君主之權位而立當强之基礎」。（三）君主之地位不同。老子「放任寬容之極，則君主等於虛設，威勢無所施用。申韓思想中之君主，則為始皇混一前夕之專制火君，集威勢於一身，行賞罰於萬衆。……故（法家所謂）無為者乃「藏刑匿智之別名，不可與歙歙為天下渾其心」者相提並論」。（丙）「脚注」甚多——著者對於本書所用功力之深，可自每章中脚注（foot－notes）之多見之。每章所加脚注都在百條以上，商子與韓子一章竟有一百四十二條之多。這些脚注或標明「引用語句」之來歷出處，或補充發揮譽中之所未詳者，這在國內出版的學術著作中是不常見的。本書還有許多好處，但著者却謙虛地說：「撰者學殖荒落、而本書屬稿値抗戰期中，參考圖書又頗不便」。其實這醫眞是抗戰期中，國內學術界上的一個收獲。我們希望本書的　　其餘各冊能早些與我們相見。</p>

<h3>「貨幣與物價之研究」</h3>
<p>— 張振聲</p>
<p>蔣廷　著　作者書社經售</p>
<p>利到現在已經十個月，而民生的痛苦，依然如故，各地的物價均仍繼續上升，因此而演成罷工及怠工的風潮，加之外貨源源而來，所有生產之工廠已至極危險之境界。凡此種種，其原因固不止一端，但除政局外，即為貨幣與物價問題。故最近對於貨幣與物價討論者頗多，但大都均限於一時一地之作，或對於外匯，或關於物價指數，或叙述一地物價之情形等，對於貨幣與物價整個問題之著作，則尙未之見。蔣先生對於本書之作，確很適合目下之需要。</p>
<p>全書共分八章，計（一）貨幣槪說，（二）物價槪說（五）信用與通貨，（四）通貨之價値，（五）物價漲跌之原因，（六）貨幣數量說，（七）物價漲跌之影響與物價政策，（八）我國近代物價漲跌之槪况。在第一二章內，將貨幣與物價詳細分析說明，使對於研究貨幣與物價者，先將本問題認識淸楚。然後再進而至第三四章硏究貨幣之演進而與物價問題所發生之種種關係。至第五六章則硏究物價漲跌之原因，將各種之學說詳加伸論，再參照事實而成立一種新學說，即蔣先生在本書內所創之貿易數量說。在第七章內則將物價漲跌之利害及應用何種物價政策詳細分析說明。至最後第入章復將我國歷年來物價漲跌之情形詳為叙述，而作舉證。全　前後一　，層次分明，對於學理與事實均加研究，使未曾硏究貨幣與物價者，獲得一極好之入門書本．</p>
<p>考各國對於貨幣與物價之學說至最近為止，當以貨幣數量說為最著。雖此說有各種之缺點，但至今尙無比較再確切之學識可將此說推翻而代之者。今蔣先生在本書則將此說推翻而創貿易數量說以代之。蔣先生說：「貨物在貨幣未發明前，早已存在，但昔日之貨物並非經貨幣相交換，故並無物價問題，將來世界科學進步，則近代之通貨或許將來完全廢除，而代以其他之方法，亦未可知。若到彼時，則物價自亦不成其為問題。但貨物之需要，則人生所不可缺者也，科學無諭如何進步，對於貨物之需要，祗有增加其種類，而更趨複雜，決不能打破貨物之需要而能維持生活也。故物價問題之重要性在於貨物，不在金錢或通貨也。……通貨不過一種手段，借以作為交換之媒介耳。」又說：「貨幣經過不少次之變遷，最近硬幣已趨淘汰，各種交易大都均以信用通貨與貨物相交換。……故在近代物價問題中之貨幣，已漸失其重要性，而成為物價問題之重要因素，除貨物外，即交易是也。不諭其用何種方式之交易，如不相交易，即不生物價問題。惟各種之交易雖並不均用貨幣相交換，但作為交換計算之標準尺度，則仍以通貨之數量為表示，故物價問題之基本要素，除貨物外為貿易之數量。』此種理論確有獨到之見。蔣先生又以為貨幣週轉率祗能適用於硬幣時代，而在信用通貨時代，常以貨物流通率以代之。此說亦頗為確當。並且蔣先生按照理論與事實又排成貿易數量之公式為：</p>
<p>QPC=E</p>
<p>故蔣先生在本書內不但介紹不少貨幣與物價之各種學說，日發前人所未發，而推翻英國學派克思斯氏之存餘數量說，與美國學派費許氏之交易數量說而創立一種新學說以代之。故本書對於一般已曾硏究貨幣與物價問題者，實為一增加硏究資料之極好書本也。</p>
<p>本書對於叙述事實旣詳細，分析又淸楚。在第一章內對於貨幣之沿革，將中國及其他各國之情形，要言不煩，　述頗詳。在第二章內關於物價指數之意義，功用，及計算方法等，均逐一說明，頗為詳盡，使讀者即可明了指數之功用及其算法。第六章內對於貨幣數量說之源起，及歷年來各國學者對於貨幣之各種學說均詳為伸述，讀此即可明了世界各國對於貨幣學說之演進狀况。在第八章內對於我國自民國以來之物價漲跌情形及其原因，分為二期，自民國元年至二十四年為第一期，自廿五年至最近為止為第二期，每期詳細分述，並附有各種極有價値之指數表。故本書對於一般硏究貨幣與物價問題者，又為一不可多得之參攷書本也。</p>
<h3>「霜葉紅似二月花」評介</h3>
<p>— 姚隼</p>
<p>茅盾先生的這部長約百五十餘萬言的巨著「霜葉紅似二月花」，第一部約十五萬字，已經由華華書店印行了。這是以民國十年間——五四時代作為背景，對當時的社會作個詳盡的描寫。舊的社會受着時代潮流的盪激，已經開始動搖了，但反動的勢力正在作着有力的掙扎，迴光反照，這經霜的葉子正和春花一樣地殷紅。</p>
<p>茅盾先生把這故事安排在都市附近的一個小縣裏，這可以淨除浮面上的事物，而使人更能看淸當時中國社會的情形，而也使主題更為突出。</p>
<p>這裏有着舊的地主階級和新的資產階級間的衝突，勾心鬥角，明槍暗箭；這裏有着較有正義感的智識靑年的徬徨和苦悶。作者把這些連串着，交織着，寫成了一首動人的史詩。</p>
<p>作為舊的地主階級的代表的，是趙守義和他的一羣，他霸佔着善堂十多年來的積存，不肯把賬目公佈，而作為他的對手的，新的資產階級的代表者王伯申和他的一羣，却籍口舉辦貧民習藝所，要他把吃到嘴裏的肥肉吐出來，但趙守義馬上來個反擊，內為王伯申的輪船公司的輪船走在淺水的內河裏，使得河水時常冲毀岸邊的民田，趙守義便派他的爪牙徐士秀和曹志誠慫恿農民打輪船，王伯中用警察彈壓，打死了一個鄕下小孩，這事情弄火了，但他們却和解了，一邊的本錢是吃虧的鄕下人，和一條小孩的人命，一邊的本錢是善堂的公積，公家的財產，而吃虧的仍然是老百姓。</p>
<p>徬徨着，苦悶着的智識靑年，首先是張府的少爺如，他的家庭替他娶了現在的少奶奶，但他却傾心於他的表妹許靜心、他老想出外做點事業，但他的祖母却要他在家裏守住祖業；他不滿於現狀，但却又無法改變目前的環境。第二個是恂如的姊夫黃和光，他有儘够溫飽一世的家財，他有美貌而多才的嬌妻，但為了他生理上的缺陷，不能曲盡丈夫的天職，更無法傳宗接代，並且因此吸上了雅片，弄得萎靡不振，而他又不甘於就此斷送了一生。第三個是恂如的表兄錢良材，在這三個主角裏頭，他是比較有為的一個，他有熱情。有勇氣，一心想替地方上做點事情，情願犧牲自己的利益，常輪船冲毀田地的時候，他反對曹志誠他們慫恿鄉民打輪船的舉動，而敎本鄉的農民縮地築堰，犧牲了少數低窪的田地，而保全多數人的利益，損失的則由大家分攤，他懷着「對大家有利」的信念做去，而當他明白了大家是不大願意而却又服從他的時候，他的自信又在幻滅了。在趙守義和王伯申雙方的鬥法中，他也從中出顯，想把一條小人命換得地方上的一　公益，但結果是他作了難人，而佔便宜的，還是趙守義和王伯申，他的徬徨和苦悶，是比恂如和光他們更為深沉的。</p>
<p>為什麽當時的改革運勁一事無成呢？書中的一位不合時宜的紳縉朱行健說：「……我們學人家的光化電，多少還有點樣子，惟獨學到典章政法，却完全不成個氣候，這是什麽緣故呢？……」</p>
<p>這是什麼緣故呢？黃和光說：「我想，世上是不好不壞，可好可壞的人太多，這才縱容壞人肆無忌憚罷？」</p>
<p>「為什麽一個人會成為可好可壞？……如果是他不認識什麽是好，什麽是壞，可又幹麽人人能說什麽是好什麼是壞？旣然能說，為什麼不能做？」錢良材問着：「你，我，我們三個，到底算不算可好可壞的一夥？如果也是可好可壞的，有沒有自已想過，倒底是什麼緣故？」</p>
<p>在當時，朱行健錢良材等人，只能够理解到這一點，矛盾先生並沒有更進一步在這裏說敎，而把這一問題留了下來。</p>
<p>霜葉紅似二月花，到現在，也還不是那麽殷紅麽？時代又推進了二十餘年了，對於這個問題，難道我們還照着錢良材他們那時的看法麽！</p>
<p>茅盾先生的小說，我覺得是吸收融化着中國舊小說中的優點的，譬如這「霜葉紅似二月花」，對於故事的安排，先是由瑞姑太太回到張府和老太太的閑談中作為引子，把出塲人物的家世叙出，又藉着人物的移動，把故事帶到另一個塲合中去，層層發展，最後用婉小姐抱螟蛉女的塲而作個總結，一氣呵成，毫不牽強。又如對於人物的處理，他用正面的描寫。從別的人物的嘴裏的側而的襯托，以及主人公本身的對話，辯論和分析，使每一個人物個性和性格，都非常生動和凸出。這些，都是我們在舊小說中常常看到的。這種例子在本書中很多，這裏因為篇幅的限制，不能够詳加列舉。</p>
<p>茅盾先生的文體，是以白描見長，明快·平穩·細緻·逐層發展，一點不牽强做作，也沒有故作驚人之筆，而是深沉的，寫實的。這文體，不是細心的讀者，是不客易體會到的，因之而覺得有點沉悶。</p>
<p>吳組湘先生評「霜葉紅似二月花」有點「論文化」，這是指書中的許多辯論和分析而言的，但這些却可以藉以表現出人物的思想和個性，這是舊小說的特長，只要不落入心理描寫的臼窠中，這種手法是可以採取的。</p>

<h3>記丁西林</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>在五四以後不久，看到好幾種初期的通俗劇和鬧劇，淺顯易曉；忽然看到丁西林的「一隻馬蜂」，便覺得突出同儕，耳目為之一新。它給我們的是一種不尋常的新鮮感覺。這集子是幾個獨幕劇的結集，裏面的對話，漂亮，幽默，兜着闂子說話，不僅不令人討厭，反而使人喜歡。許多雋妙的話句，眞　他想得出來。其中「壓迫」一篇，是最流行的，不知曾有多少劇團上演過。我曾經拿他的「北京的空氣」一篇，選入我的「初中混合國語敎科書」中，作為修辭學及語格的舉例，因為這一篇處處說僕人好，其實是處處說僕人壞。</p>
<p>為了耙念五四文藝節，中華全國文藝協會决定邀請這一位五四時代的作家來演說，並且演他的「壓迫」；在這上海閙房荒的時候，重演這戲，也很有意思。前兩天我便特地到中央研究院物理硏究所去看他，先事接治。這時正下着濛濛的細雨，我雖感到一點不方便，還是懷着一顆興奮的心前去。終於我在一間會客室裏看到他踏着安閑的步子走來。頭上白髮已經很多，和藹的笑容使人有慈煦的媽媽的感覺。我頓時變成小孩，沐浴在溫暖的光輝裏。他吿訴我文藝節那一天要到南京去，中央研究所在那兒建築天文台，須去看看，雖然不曾邀請到他，而後來「壓迫」也沒有演成，但能够有機會看到我所仰慕的作家，心裏總是高興的。我仍舊踏着濛濛的細雨走出那一座樹叢潤濕的花園。</p>
<p>也是一側濛濛的細雨天，在夜間，我披上了雨衣，到卡爾登去看丁西林的新作「等太太回來的時候」的上演。凑巧西林坐在我前一排，正在聚精會神地看他自己親手培植的創作。先演一個短劇「三塊錢國幣」。這兩個劇本都寫到僕人，却與「北京的空氣」不同。前者叙少爺小姐拉女僕坐下，一同喝茶，女僕在謙讓之後，便不安地坐下來了。後者叙一個大學生為了不滿一位女主人辭歇女僕，而洩憤地打破了她的另一個花瓶，再賠她三塊錢國幣，因為這是她定下來的要女僕賠償打碎花瓶的價格。這兩點都說明了作者是怎樣一位同情於女僕的遭遇的人。</p>
<p>「等太太回來的時候」寫的是父親做漢奸，大女兒與女壻附和着他，但妻子，兒子，小女兒對於這件事都反對，結果是三個反對者的出走。兒子在一個早晨整理行裝，預備瞞着母親出走。不料母親却下樓來對他說，地那整班行裝的聲音任誰也可以驚醒，還吿訴他，她已經買了三張船票，她自己與小妹妹也跟他一同走。臨走時她騙大女兒，說是把兒子押着去取回行李，又給了女僕很多錢，女僕莫名其妙，問大小姐，大小姐要她「等太太回家的時候」來問太太。</p>
<p>這戲劇還是抗戰第三年編的，倘若當時環境許可演出，一定可以引起觀衆激昂熱烈的鼓掌；民族正氣是永遠應該提倡的，但現在觀衆所處的時代和要求都已經不同了。淺薄的我，看「妙峯山」雖不甚懂，像不懂曹禺的「北京人」一樣，但我嘉歡「妙峯山」，這裏面藏着「西林獨幕劇集」一貫的作風，想入非非的事件與對白給了我一種新奇的刺激。現在的這兩個戲劇作風却與以前不同，似乎已由絢爛而歸於平淡，或者說，更多的接近寫實，很容易懂，平易近人。大約丁先生感覺到抗戰大力的推盪，耳聞目擊了許多可歌可泣的事件，便秉着正義寫下了這大義的戲劇。這時他不暇顧及他的按巧，他不願再用那些小聰明，只覺得有一股磅薄的力量在催促着他寫，他便一口氣寫了下來，直到戲快寫完時，鬆了一口氣，纔又想起了「西林風」，因此也就在末了給了我們一個不尋常的結束。</p>
<p>戲演完以後，兩林立起來，替他的太太扣上雨衣的鈕扣。我與他握手吿別，趁便問了他幾句關於劇本的話，他頗惶惑，火約怕人發現或注意到他是誰，這正看出他的謙抑，他不是胸間插着百合花招搖過市的王爾德。</p>
<h3>野貓（小說）</h3>
<p>— 池沼</p>
<p>這幾天放學後帶着三個孩子從學校回家，還未就讀年僅五歲的蘭兒，總有許多新聞告訴我們聽。他呶着小嘴，揮着小手說：</p>
<p>「今早，樓下姆姆買了兩隻鷄鷄！」</p>
<p>「枇杷果七百塊一斤，前樓嫉嬸買了一大簍！」</p>
<p>「阿葉今天中午吃了兩隻粽子！」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>他每次的結語是：「爸爸我們也買！」那時食指老放在小嘴內，顯現出馋涎的樣子。</p>
<p>蘭兒這些話，他的三哥哥和二哥哥最感覺興趣，也聽得最入神，可是每當蘭兒說：「爸爸，我們也買！」大哥哥總會拉着他的小手擾亂他說：「弟弟和你說去！」</p>
<p>看了馬路上和鄰家的悄形，我也知道快要到端陽節了，然而……想到那問題的時候，對孩子們天眞的要求，我總是沉默着。人兒馨是個十二歲的孩子，生長在貧困的環境裏造成了他憂　的性格，也許因為他的年齡比三個弟弟長大，所以也像多懂些人情世故，他往往是做了家庭中排難解紛的八。然而，每當我想起大兒那種受磨難而成的「少年老成」的性格，我會為之惋惜。</p>
<p>是端陽的的大前夕，夜深了，妻巡視了四個孩子憨睡的狀態。舒一口氣躺在床上，那時我課卷也批改完了，她說：</p>
<p>「後犬就是端陽節了，孩子們這幾天看到人家買東吃西，眼巴巴的望着，怪可轔的，我們也要買些應個景兒。」</p>
<p>「唔！」我在沉思着。</p>
<p>「樓下二房東買了一斗糯米、裏了一百多只粽子，前樓也買了五升，其他像鷄枇杷果都買好了。我們也該買二升糯米，二斤枇杷；鷄雖然買不起，也該買二斤魚肉吧，而且孩子們也個把月不吃肉了，過時過節也該讓他們高興高興，單看人家吃着，怪可憐的。」妻在滔滔不絕的又說了一大堆話。</p>
<p>說到孩子的可憐，做父親的那有不體會的道理。而我家的四個孩子，因平時習慣了不是「有朮必應」的境遇，所以也特別聽話，說的，吃的，都遵着父母的指示，從沒有嚎啕頓足要吃要玩的。可是，一想到照妻那樣說過一個節就要花去兩斗米的價錢，兩斗米不是可以支持一家六口餐粥餐飯十天的口糧嗎，我躊躇了，我更沉默了，我想起自己是個士大夫階級末落的今日的一個窮敎師，每月只有數萬元的束修，一個月的生活也支持不了，何來這筆例外的花費。</p>
<p>『你，你的意思怎麽樣？』妻像不耐緘默的催促着我的答案</p>
<p>我嘆了一口氣，我起床拿起紙烟抽着，四個孩子憨睡的姿態映入眼廉，我走近他們床前輕撫着他們—他們那營養不足的臉面和肢體，我終於答應了妻的建議，幷且說費用不能超過一萬元。</p>
<p>在燈光下，我看到妻那操勞過度因而瘦削枯黃的臉上　起了紅暈，緊蹙的眉也開展了，她還像忘了一天疲勞興奮地說：</p>
<p>『到了節日，魚肉一定比平日更貴，還是明早先買來燒好待到過節那天吃。』</p>
<p>第二天，孩子們一起來，妻就將今天預備買的東西吿訴他們，最小的三個孩子都拍着小手，可是大兒還是像無動於中的，催領着他們洗盥去，而蘭兒却連臉也不抹了，他趕忙走出房去吿訴他同屋的小同伴說：</p>
<p>『我們今天買魚，買肉，買枇杷果，紮粽子。』他說得沫花四測的。</p>
<p>「鷄鷄呢？你們買不買？我們有鷄鷄。」樓下的小囡在問他</p>
<p>蘭兒便趕着走回來拉着妻的衣角說：</p>
<p>「媽媽，我們買不買鷄鷄？」他睜大眼在等回答。</p>
<p>「買，買，什麼都買！」妻還沒有回答，大兒　氣憤憤的搶着說了。</p>
<p>「買，買，什麽都買！蘭兒也搶到扶梯口在對樓下的小囡說。</p>
<p>當放學回家，妻已裹好了粽，燜好了兩火碗紅燒肉，還有一段　魚，枇杷果不用說也置來了。</p>
<p>紅燒肉怪可愛的，給醬油熬得黃澄澄亮晶晶地，一塊一塊像「麻將牌」的樣兒一股兒的香氣，引起了幾雙小眼睛向它眨着閃着。</p>
<p>吃晚飯了，為了孩子們不能忘情，只好准每人先吃兩塊紅燒肉，小臉上都浮滿了笑意，蘭兒們只把肉吮着來送飯，捨不得吞下肚去。</p>
<p>「今天肉價二千五一斤，算起來値一百多塊錢一塊，你們仔細嘗嘗。」妻在說着也得意地露出笑容了，大兒却吐出了舌頭。</p>
<p>「去年端陽節，用偽鈔的時候，也不過一千五一斤，今年又漲一千了，近幾天來樣樣小菜都漲價，　呌人吃菜根也難！」妻又在感慨地說。</p>
<p>飯後，替孩子們洗換好了，妻又考慮到放置魚和肉的問題，因為天氣熱，假使放在櫉裏，恐怕會引起腐壞，豈不可惜，所以結果還是決定放在靠窗的桌子上，那地方又通風是最妥當的。</p>
<p>孩子們記掛着第二天起來有好東西吃，早已酣然熟睡了，妻忙碌了一天，而且今天更像做完了一件大事也呼呼地睡着。我更像盡了最火的責任，心安理得地也睡得安穩，只給在　合上吵鬧的貓兒吵醒了一次，推着旁睡的妻，她竟是像無知無覺的。</p>
<p>端陽節的早晨，當我還未醒來的時候，却給妻和孩子的說話聲吵醒了，我覺得好像出了什麼亂子似的。</p>
<p>『什麽事，一早就吵？』我問。</p>
<p>「爸爸，爸爸，肉和魚給野貓偷吃了，」孩子們在嚷着。</p>
<p>「媽媽昨晚把魚和肉放在桌上，給貓吃掉了！」大兒也露出埋怨的口吻說。</p>
<p>我爬起床來，見妻正露出懊喪的樣子，兩眼也潤朗多了，我　那截魚已沒有了，兩碗肉，每碗都去了一半，不覺也發怔起來。</p>
<p>「吃去那許多，一定是不只一隻死貓吃的。」妻在喃喃地說。「二千五百元一斤差不多吃了一半，還有那一截魚也買了二千五百元。」妻在嘆惜着。</p>
<p>我本想說昨晚已聽到貓在吵閙，可是恐怕妻和孩子們要怪我，所以只好改換口氣安慰他們說：</p>
<p>「還好，還好，只吃了一半。」</p>
<p>事後，妻和我商量，她說這件事不能宣揚出去給同居和鄰人知道，因為給貓吃掉魚和肉，照理只要再　便了，可是我們那裏再能買得起，若是不買豈不叫人笑話，所以這件事還是不給人知道的好，只能餓着腸胃挺起肚子裝體面了。三個大的孩子還懂事，却恐怕蘭兒漏了嘴，所以妻在恐嚇着蘭兒，說這種事不許對人說。蘭兒的小心靈裏，也像家裏發生了大事一般，終日只悶悶的，果然沒有對人說起。</p>
<p>對於妻的建議，我雖然是不贊成，可是想到自已不能離羣獨處，更為了同情妻的遭遇，也就沒有說話了，只可憐孩子們也給妻敎導了撒謊。</p>
<p>那天，我們是閉起門來吃晚飯的，妻和我只默默地聽着鄰舍和同居喝酒拇戰的聲音，孩子們却仍是高興的，因為還有給野貓吃　的肉吃，還有枇杷吃，還有</p>

<p>昨天晚上你睡得好嗎？我　怕你會招了凉。雖然各人都因興奮而忘了寒冷，而夜風却是帶着秋氣的。「如此星辰非昨夜，為誰風露立中有」可是誰又能捨這在母校相叙最後的一晚呢？上天也似乎特地為我們安排了道最美最動人的一晚。幾天來沒有見面的月亮，却在昨夜漏臉了。而且還帶給了我們最愛撫最溫柔的照臨，讓我們浴在她慈愛的光裏，恣性的吵鬧，盡情的談笑。四下的市聲都已死寂。祇風息在樹梢低吟。我們年靑的笑聲漾溢在母校的懷裏，它將永遠的響着。在每個六月十五的夜晚它將久遠地成為萬古的回音。</p>
<p>終於我們又見到了月蝕；這在我們中間許多人是一個新奇的經歷。可又眞巧，在昨夜会讓我們見到了這天界的奇象。常我們看着那滿盈盈的月亮給陰影吞沒下去的時候，我們都覺得黯然。就是這麽很快的　了又缺了麽？使我們又想到將要這臨到我們身上的離別的那件事來。我們還凄然地掉了淚；為了從梳小辮子的時候起到一同畢業这段友誼，對着這美麗的宇宙，我們掉淚了。明亮的淚花，將會結起來，照耀着迎我們而來的許多許多的日子。我以前曾有過這麽一句「丈夫淚，只向山河　。」今夜，我覺得這淚也掉得値得了。</p>
<p>星移更轉，我們還是谈着，笑着。各人的眼前都浮現着美好的將來。在至高，美着的希望裏，我們確立起我們的信心。為什麼我們不能使今夜成為將來迴憶裏最有意義的一夜呢？默默的，我們都立下了担負起使這世界變得更好一點的工作的誓願。現在我們，又感到了偉大的和渺小的存在。雖則我們許多人中有一些極微小的恩怨，從現在起，我信，都應從大家默默相印之中，輕輕的放開了。</p>
<p>在人的一生中，多的是一些嚴肅和美好的責任；這些責任，都是不知不覺的給我們負起，又不知不覺的給我們完成。以前，進學校的時候，我們還不懂事，只知道跑跑跳跳，笑笑鬧鬧啊。然而在無意，無形之間，我們已担起了一個嚴肅而美好的責任。我們是為着求學，為着要充實自已，敎育自已。現在一個階段可吿完成了。在幾年淪陷期間共同相處的同學要分手了。在不知不覺之中，我們又搭起另一個嚴肅而美好的責任來，那就是互愛，友誼。假使我們能勝任，我們就完成了一件宇宙間最有價値的工作。假使我捫之外無量數的人都能勝任，這世界將會變得更適合於人類居處一點。</p>
<p>昨兒晚上，壓根兒我就沒有好睡過。在夜深深的時候，似乎聽得有人在幽幽的吸泣。心中眞太煩了，祇得連連默誦着「惜往日」裏的詞句，直至昏昏的睡去。夜又太短了。</p>
<p>朋友，我們應該總是在一起的。</p>

<h3>彫刻室隨筆（二）</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>彫刻的種類</p>
<p>以材料來分，彫刻的種類頗多。——木彫，石彫，泥塑，Terrcotta，乾漆，鑄金，牙彫，鐵筆等。</p>
<p>木彫與塑造東洋較西洋為多，且技術特殊而有味，歷史亦悠久。木彫在西洋的作法，必先塑泥型，再以泥型翻為石膏而後依樣模刻（其石刻製作程序亦同）。東洋則不然，如各廟宇享堂的木彫佛像，大多是以一根整木，憑空彫刻，有時另加手足，其形態雖不如西洋之寫實，但，古樸莊嚴之神情，遠非西洋作品所及，塑造在東洋，尤其是中國，另有夾苧古法，遠如唐代楊惠之塑於蘇州角直所塑之佛像，距今近千年尙完整如故，此亦非西洋人夢想得到的事，因為塑造在西洋，僅不過作為習作或鑄金與石刻木彫的母型而已。木彫所用之木，樟，檜，櫻，桂，朴，黃楊皆宜，在我國一般善男善女彫彿像講求聖潔虔誠，有時用檀香為之，不過為數甚少，樟不易蛀，黃楊易人刀，櫻紋較美，其他各有優劣之點。作者亦各有所好。西一洋中世紀木彫為寺院裝飾甚多，現代擅長木彫之作家亦不少，馬育（Maillol）可算是興趣較濃的一個。郭　（P．Gauguin）在泰地也作了很多土人風的木彫，頗有趣味。</p>
<p>石彫，西洋古代埃及希臘甚多，其作多用意大利卡拉拉特產的白大理石，質細膩澤潤，製成彫像極美觀。近代作家所作亦多，羅丹（Rodin）亦喜用之。中國古代石彫亦盛行，宋以後，就漸次衰落，明朝雖仍有人提倡，但為數極少。今尤存者如金陵之明陵前之石人石獸，其技術因受匈牙利影響與唐代又路有不同</p>
<p>乾漆彫，是以陶土鋸木層拌生漆塑造者，杭州靈隱寺之濟公像，即取此法，年久不裂，堅固異當，近年已為日人襲用，國人反不重視。</p>
<p>鑄金，無論東西洋，古代均極興盛，其製作即如上述，必先塑泥型而後翻為石膏，再翻為砂模而後熔金屬物為液體灌人始成，金銀銅鐵錫鉛均可為之，普通以靑銅較多，製作手續甚為煩瑣</p>
<p>牙彫，西洋中世耙多取之彫作聖母像，中國明淸間亦多利用彫作觀音像，中西藝術無形中發生了共鳴。</p>
<p>鐵筆彫，因其彫刀如筆，用以彫刻竹器，東方人擅此技者甚多，興趣亦較濃，也許是產竹之故。</p>
<p>Terrcotta，是用陶士所製，製成後人窰燒成的一種彫刻，西洋近年頗盛行。我國宜興亦有之，惟皆出於匠工之手，故趣味低級。</p>
<p>由彫刻的技法分門別類的話：那又有立體彫，浮彫。凹刻，綫刻數種。普通所見凡周圍無物面面可觀者謂之立彫，浮彫與凹刻是彫刻與繪畫混合的一種產物，同繪畫一樣祗能看一面，所不同者就是除給人視覺的賞鐵外，還多一種觸覺。綫刻，以其說它是彫刻母寗說它是繪畫好得多，因為它僅是用的工具不同而已。</p>
<h3>愛的看法</h3>
<p>— 鋆</p>
<p>中原君在本報春秋欄上寫過一　　名「母親」的文字，我看了好像字裏行間充滿着至性的面淚。當我講完最後一句時，心裏一陣難熬眼淚跟着掉下來了。當然啦！也有着與中原君的同橡母愛，而母親也離開了人間，可是，我沒生花的妙筆，能給描摹像中原君的那樣生動文衆。我對愛的看法，認為人類任何的愛，總比不上母愛的偉大。自來母愛其子，可說無徵不至，眞愛洗露，所至披糜，績者誰都可以體味，惟獨世上頗少子愛其母，甚有　母的，這比較還是女兒輩來得順從和體貼．你該知道，你不愛你的母親，回頭你的子女就不見得把你妻子作母親看。因此，在一個家庭中，我們首先要把愛妻子的愛，移到愛母親的身上，一來用以報答，是應有的。二來做一榜樣，先給妻子看，再給兒女學，不是很對麽？</p>
<p>男女之間，祗可說上一個私字，私者，自我之見，並不純潔，也無至性，揭穿了說，逃不出互相利用而已。談不到情，更沒有什麽愛，所以母愛，才是人類眞正的至愛</p>
<p>我希望像中原君所作「母親」一類的文字，多多在報上發表，使一般不了解母愛眞諦的，對愛的看法或能轉移其視綫。</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛（六六）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>墨太太少不得安慰了翁二太太一番。好在自己的心情，並沒有受到傳染，她還是為無限希望的憧憬而快活着，對於剛才石玉樓的話，她不十分了解，她也不需要了解。她現在所唯一記罣的，是明天的榮耀，她想像着明天麗華登台以後，全戲園子的觀衆都為麗華鼓掌叫好，於是，戲園經理來向她伸出大姆指，要求和她訂合同。從此，麗華變成了這戲園子的紅角兒；從此，她每月可以得到「包銀」；（優伶固定的酬勞。）從此，她的一生無憂無慮了！想到這裏，不禁笑逐顏開地替麗華預備了新年穿的長衣服，又把麗華與到眼前，親切地撫着她說：</p>
<p>「小華，明天你就十歲了，明天你第一次登台！可千萬別叫媽失望呀！要好好地唱，用心地表演。三天以後，你師父說：就可以正式「下海」了。將來掙了錢，媽讓你吃好的；穿好的；享一輩子的福。」</p>
<p>麗華不作聲，她似乎沒有聽見墨太太的話。</p>
<p>「孩子，上了台可別害羞，有你師父給你作胡琴，還像在家裏一樣，該怎麽唱，怎麼唱；該怎麽表演，怎麽表演；一點不要慌；不要怕。」墨太太又殷殷叮嚀了一回。</p>
<p>麗華照舊啞然不語，眼看着天花板，臉上露出漢然無關的神氣。</p>
<p>墨太太見麗華不言語，以為她是睏了，便催着她去睡覺。</p>
<p>「早點睡去吧，明兒早點起來穿新衣裳！」墨太太說。</p>
<p>麗華這才「哼」了一聲，走開了。</p>
<p>事實上麗華一點兒也不　，她的腦子裏起伏着雜亂無章的思潮。但她並不覺得有什麼傷心之處，她只是覺得奇怪！奇怪墨太太為什麽不用別的方法叫她「掙錢」？她知道可以掙錢的方法很多，譬喻她去替人家當丫頭；她會掃地，洗碗，抱小孩，她並不以為這些就是吃苦。她還可以到裁縫舖去替人家縫縫衣服邊，做做粗針綫。她看見裁縫舖裏有許多年靑女孩子在那裏做着工作。但墨太太偏不！！單選了一條唱戲掙錢的路！剛才石玉樓還說過！唱戲是給人家「解悶兒」這明明不是好事體，連石玉樓都怨這行了；而墨太太反倒叫她幹這行；什麼道理呢？她不懂！可她也不願違抗墨太太。她打也挨了，罪也受了，旣然學了這行，就只有幹這行！致於想到明天登台的事，她也只有茫然的感覺。她記得她看過石玉樓在台上唱戲的情形；她，還有許多人；都在台下瞅着石玉樓，而石玉樓像沒有看見他們似的，儘管唱他的。那麼，她明天也要在台上唱，讓許多人在台下瞅着她了。她會羞嗎？但羞也不能不唱！於是她便決定：也只好學石玉樓那樣，像沒有看見許多人似的，儘管唱自巴的。</p>
<p>「唱戲分明是給人家開心的玩意兒，而壞妹妹自己錯把唱戲當作了「玩意兒」！」</p>
<p>麗華自言自語地說。她理解了這個意識，想到麗華把唱戲當作玩意兒的幼稚，又不禁好笑了。</p>

<h3>Three-Party Meeting Adjourned Again Yesterday and Today; Studying the CCP's Counterproposal on Troop Reorganization; General Ma Met Separately with Yu and Zhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 26th] The three-party meeting continued its adjournment for another day today. Special Envoy Marshall, drawing from past experience, believes that for major and complex issues, if sufficient preparation is not made beforehand, the meeting will not only be a waste of words but also affect the emotions of all parties during the meeting, thus missing fleeting opportunities. However, when Special Envoy Ma issued the notice late last night, he only stipulated a one-day adjournment. Now, the US side and the government are studying the CCP's counterproposal on troop reorganization submitted today, which requires thorough consideration.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 20th] The military three-party meeting is scheduled to continue its adjournment for another day tomorrow. Zhou Enlai is scheduled to visit Marshall tomorrow at 11:00 AM. It is also heard that the delay in discussing the troop reorganization issue is because the CCP's counterproposal has not yet been submitted. It is now learned that the CCP's counterproposal has been drafted and submitted to Marshall this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 26th] Zhou Enlai spent from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM this afternoon discussing troop reorganization issues at Special Envoy Ma's residence. Tonight, Special Envoy Ma will meet with Foreign Minister Yu for discussions.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 26th] Representatives of the Democratic League, Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru, Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, and Luo Longji, went to Meiyuan New Village at 9:00 PM tonight to hear a report from Teng Daiyuan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the CCP's Eighth Route Army, on the military situation. At that time, the lights on Mensheng Street in Meiyuan New Village were dim, and few pedestrians were seen. More than a dozen reporters waited for this news under the dim light until 11:00 PM, when it was still not over.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 26th] Representatives of the Third Force held internal discussions at Fengyi Village at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The results of the discussion included two points: (1) They believe that the prospects for peace are facing a serious juncture, and they hope for the success of peace and do not want to create unnecessary complications to avoid affecting peace. (2) They hope that the CCP will submit its counterproposal on troop reorganization as soon as possible so that the troop reorganization meeting can be held quickly. The former two points will be conveyed separately by the representatives, while the latter will be conveyed by Liang Shuming to Meiyuan New Village tonight. The Third Force will also have another internal discussion tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] According to reliable sources tonight: Regarding the issue of the authority of the US representatives in the Three-Person Group, the Executive Headquarters, and the Executive Group, there was previously a fierce debate, which has now been resolved. After one of the most difficult issues in the peace negotiations was resolved, the representatives can focus their efforts on discussing the issue of army reorganization. It is learned that the Communist Party delegation has submitted proposals for the reorganization issue for the National Government to consider. These proposals were personally delivered by Zhou Enlai to General Marshall at 2:30 PM this afternoon. Zhou Enlai and Special Envoy Ma had a secret talk for nearly three hours. It is also learned that he will meet with Special Envoy Ma again at 9:00 AM tomorrow. The details of the understanding on the authority of the US representatives in the China peace mediation mechanism are not yet known, but informed sources believe that this understanding is largely based on the Communist Party's proposal, that is, the US representatives have the right to submit independent reports, conduct investigations, and implement the decisions of the Three-Person Group. The point that the decisions of the Three-Person Group must be unanimously agreed upon is still maintained.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 26th] Xinmin Bao stated today: The KMT and the CCP are willing to compromise on the last of the three issues in Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order of June 6, namely, the issue of troop reorganization and stationing. The National Government is prepared to make concessions on entering various areas, and the CCP is willing to make concessions on the points of the February 25 agreement, but requests to expand the proportion of the Communist army in the Northeast. The reason is that the "Democratic Allied Army" in the Northeast has a large number of troops. The original agreement between the two sides was for the Communist army to station three divisions in the Northeast, and the National Army to station fifteen divisions. Now the Communist army is requesting to increase two divisions. The three-person military group "has not held a meeting today because the opinions of the two sides are still widely divergent."</p>
<h3>Minister Peng Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters; Hopes Certain Parties Will Abandon Incendiary Policies; Chairman Has Repeatedly Revised Plans Regarding Troop Reorganization</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] This afternoon at 4:30, the Ministry of Information held a reception for foreign reporters, hosted by Minister Peng and Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The important Q&amp;A is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) Last week, when the petitioning representatives at Xiaguan Station were beaten at night, several foreign reporters witnessed the scene for several hours. The military police did not make efforts to protect them, as if someone had instructed them. Who should be responsible for this?</p>
<p>(Minister Peng's Answer) The government expresses great regret for the Xiaguan brawl. Such atrocities are absolutely unforgivable. The police failed to disperse the two sides who were debating and scolding each other at the station for several hours, and failed to stop the fighting in time. Although it is said that the city's police force is weak and lacks transportation, making it difficult to mobilize quickly, the failure to protect is undeniable. The government has dismissed the chief of the police station in charge and reported to Shen Cheng, the director of the capital police. Shortly after the brawl, a large number of military police arrived, dispersed the crowd, and rescued the injured. We are very sympathetic to the injured and very angry at the rioters. However, we cannot help but mention the similar incident that occurred in Shanghai on the same day. When the petitioning representatives left Shanghai, thousands of demonstrators went to the station to see them off. On their way back, they passed the YMCA and broke into the dormitory, arresting several anti-communist students. In addition to beating and tearing their clothes, they wrote insulting words in black paint on their backs, tied them up, and paraded them. In a nearby park, they held a so-called people's trial. These students were also rescued by the same late military police at the most dangerous time. This incident happened just a few hours before the Xiaguan incident, casting an ironic light on the peace and human rights guarantees represented by the peace representatives. I sincerely hope that certain parties will abandon such sinister tactics, do not incite lovely young people, and put elderly people who do not understand the outside world into the limelight of mass movements to create propaganda tragedies. We have heard that similar incitement is being actively carried out. We also want to ask Mr. Xie who is pulling the strings behind the scenes to reconsider this plan from a humanitarian point of view.</p>
<p>(Question) The Ministry of Information claims that the masses are refugees from northern Jiangsu. If this is true, how can it be proven? How many rioters have been arrested, and what are their names and origins? Are the refugees as organized as the masses on that day?</p>
<p>(Minister Peng's Answer) Tens of thousands of refugees from northern Jiangsu live near Xiaguan Station, so nearby residents can easily identify them. Eight people suspected of rioting have been arrested. Two of them have been proven innocent and released. Two others, named Cheng Qiong and Chen Xishu, have been proven to have participated in the riot and will be punished according to law. If you have time, you can visit them. A few days before the riot, the refugees from northern Jiangsu were launching an organization association. The association was established on the 24th. At yesterday's press conference for the petitioning representatives, the refugee association formally apologized to the petitioning representatives, which you all witnessed.</p>
<p>(Question) To what extent should the final agreement be expected to reach before June 29? It is heard that the Chairman has revised his request regarding the Communist Party's withdrawal from certain areas. Can you please explain?</p>
<p>(Minister Peng's Answer) The three points indicated by the Chairman in the order to stop advancing, namely, stopping conflicts, restoring transportation, and reorganizing the army, must be resolved definitively before the end of the month. The Chairman has repeatedly revised his plan to accommodate the demands of the Communist Party. At this stage, details cannot be disclosed.</p>
<h3>Commemorating Chairman's Great Achievements; Huangshan on the South Bank of Chongqing Renamed Zhongzheng Mountain</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] Huangshan on the bank of Chongqing was the location of Chairman Chiang's official residence in Chongqing. The former Chongqing Temporary Senate, in order to commemorate the Chairman's great achievements, had requested the municipal government to rename Huangshan as Zhongzheng Mountain. Recently, the municipal government obtained approval from the Executive Yuan and officially announced that the name change will officially take effect from today.</p>
<h3>CCP's Huge Sum of 700 Million Yuan Transported from Beiping to Hankou in Succession</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 25th] The CCP transported funds from Beiping to Hankou in June, totaling 700 million yuan. The first batch was 300 million yuan, and the second batch was 400 million yuan. It is heard that the funds have been transferred to Xuanhua Store by the Ninth Group, which requested the Operations Office to send a special army.</p>
<h3>National Population Statistics: Over 470 Million</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 26th] The Ministry of Interior announced today that, according to recent statistics, the total national population is approximately 470,026,252, including 6 million people in Taiwan Province, excluding overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>US State Department Reaffirms Mission of US Troops in China; Purpose Is to Help Us Repatriate Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] A spokesman for the US State Department reaffirmed the mission of US troops in China, which is to assist in the repatriation of Japanese troops in China at the request of the Chinese government. The sole purpose of the US troops in China is this. It is reported that Mao Zedong had requested the United States to immediately stop all military aid to the Chinese government and withdraw US troops stationed in China, hence the above statement was issued.</p>
<p>[Local News] The scope of work of the US military headquarters in China is gradually shrinking, so the number of US military headquarters personnel is also decreasing. In July of this year, the number will be further reduced. General Matthews, Chief of Staff of the US military headquarters, is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States on July 4. General Gillen, the commander-in-chief, will remain here. The US Air Force Headquarters in Shanghai has now been cancelled. Air Force Commander Evans has left Shanghai for home a few days ago. The scope of the department has been reduced and changed to the Air Force Department, which is responsible for air traffic matters and is commanded by MacReynolds.</p>
<h3>Kui Yanfang and Others Went to the National Government Yesterday; Visited Secretary-General Wu Wenguan; Explained the Purpose of This Trip; Wu Promised to Convey It to the Chairman; Kui Told Reporters That They Have a Better Understanding of the CCP's Actions</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 26th] Kui Yanfang and other representatives from Shanghai visited Secretary-General Wu Wenguan at the National Government at 3:00 PM this afternoon to explain the purpose of their visit to Nanjing and to request an audience with the Chairman. Wu replied that the Chairman was busy and unable to meet them, but he would convey the representatives' intentions on their behalf. Kui and others also met with Feng Yuxiang. Then Kui and his party went to Ninghai Road to visit Special Envoy Marshall.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 26th] Since Kui Yanfang and others held a press conference here yesterday, people in Nanjing have a very clear understanding of the eight people from Shanghai, including Ma Xulun, and have praised Kui's frankness. Our reporter visited Kui today to talk about everything. Kui's statement was the same as what he said at yesterday's reception, but he reiterated that their visit was to seek peace. The unfortunate incident in Xiaguan was a "misunderstanding," and they are determined not to resort to legal means to add to the suffering of the refugees and create complications, which is contrary to the original purpose of coming to Nanjing. Kui finally said: Since arriving in Nanjing from Shanghai, from the complaints of the refugees heard along the way, he has a deeper understanding of the CCP's atrocities. If he has the opportunity to meet with the CCP representatives in Nanjing, he will directly tell them.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin and Zhang Jia'ao Arrive in Shenyang; It Is Said That the Northeast Operations Office Will Be Changed to the Operations Headquarters Next Month; Jiang Jingguo Seeks to Restore Diplomatic Contact</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 26th] The transformation of the situation in the Northeast seems to be taking place behind the scenes. He Yingqin flew to Shenyang this morning with Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Department, and may also go to Changchun. It is said that he may return south on the 29th. He Yingqin's departure was very secret. Last night, his entourage still said that he did not intend to go to the Northeast. This mission may be quite important. It is said that the Northeast Operations Office will be changed to the Chairman's Operations Headquarters at the beginning of next month, with Xiong Shihui as the director and Du Yuming as the deputy director. Wan Fulin, Ma Zhanshan, and other elders in the Northeast will also have considerable titles. Jiang Jingguo's recent return to the Northeast indicates that the government is looking for ways to restore normal diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union in the Northeast. Since the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the outbreak of war in the Northeast, Soviet diplomats and some overseas Chinese have also withdrawn with the army, and normal diplomatic contact has been interrupted. In addition, how to restore traffic on the China Changchun Railway and the issue of Dalian's takeover are also issues that Jiang wants to solve.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 25th] Zhang Jia'ao, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Operations Office, flew to Changchun from Shenyang at 3:00 PM on the 25th. He told the Central News Agency reporter that he left Shenyang at 10:00 AM on the 25th, passed through Siping Street, landed to inspect and meet Chairman Liu Yaodong, and inspected the oil factory that was severely damaged, staying for three hours. This is his third visit to Changchun. He will take care of the China Changchun Railway and return to Shenyang on the 27th.</p>
<p>The War Atmosphere in the Northeast Is Still Very Strong</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 26th] Northeast Military Situation: (1) The atmosphere of war in the Northeast is still strong. According to Du Yuming's telegram to the relevant authorities here, a large number of Communist cavalry are gathering between Wulajie and Yushu on the north bank of the Songhua River, intending to cross the river at the Paozi ferry and claiming that they will attack Yongji and Jiutai. (2) Official news: the Yanhe Coal Mine between Shenyang and Liaoyang was attacked by more than 200 Communist troops on the 23rd, and two nearby villagers were shot and killed. The Beipiao Coal Mine in Rehe has also been destroyed recently. (3) The CCP's small-scale transportation sabotage war in the Northeast still occurs from time to time. A CCP detachment of more than a thousand people once invaded Gongzhutun near Xinmin. On the 23rd, they were repelled by the National Army and retreated to Kangping. The Qingjindou Station on the branch line from Jinzhou to Xinlitun was also attacked by the Communist army on the night of the 19th. The station was burned down, and nearby power lines and bridges were also damaged. Although the Railway Bureau has repaired and opened the road after the incident, the Communist army is still active nearby. The threat has not been reduced.</p>
<p>Frequent Movements of Communist Troops in Rehe Province</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 26th] Although there were small conflicts in the outskirts of Pan Yang and Fushun twenty days ago, it is currently peaceful. However, the shadow of war has not been completely removed from between the White Mountains and Black Waters. Currently, the Communist army in Rehe is constantly increasing its troops from the two provinces of Chahar and Liaoning. According to official intelligence, recently about 5,000 Communist troops from Zhangjiakou and Dongkaikai River, and about 30,000 people from Shandong detoured into Rehe. If the peace negotiations break down in eight days, these troops will be a new capital for the CCP to try again in the Northeast. The government is also preparing. However, under any circumstances, the United States will not give up its belief in and efforts for peace. During the short ceasefire period, US personnel have been working hard, entering and exiting gun forests and bullets, and have completed some mediation preparations. Currently, the 29th team has departed for Hailong, east of Siping Street, and the 30th team has gone to Haicheng, south of Pan Yang, to carry out their peace work.</p>
<h3>Colonel Hill Flies to Beiping and Then to Shandong; Will Implement the Restoration of Transportation; Communist Army Occupies Shayu on the Northern Section of the Tongpu Railway</h3>

<p>The Government Is Studying and Improving My Country's Tariff Policy; Because Various Countries Are Adopting Free Trade Policies, We Cannot Use Tariff Barriers to Counter Foreign Goods [Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Regarding the current tariff policy of our country, many Chinese people advocate reconsidering it, because the large-scale import of foreign goods has gradually put important markets at risk of being monopolized, and the future of domestic goods is bleak. This matter of increasing the imbalance between our international income and expenditure has a great harm to the national economy. According to the financial authorities, the import of luxury goods has been strictly prohibited, and unnecessary foreign goods will be taxed heavily. As for the current tariff policy of our country, the government is studying and improving it. Because various democratic countries are adopting a trade policy, in this trend, our country must not adopt tariff barriers to counter the import of foreign goods, but in order to develop our country's industry, appropriate measures will be taken to protect it.</p>

<h3>Chu Minyi's Case of Treason is Approved for Retrial; Prosecutor Files an Appeal, Believing the Jiangsu High Court's Ruling to be Inappropriate</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 26th] Since the Jiangsu High Court issued ruling No. 4 in the "Retrial" series on June 24th, approving the initiation of a retrial for Chu Minyi's case of treason as a collaborator, it has caused a reaction from Li Shudong, the judge and prosecutor handling the case, who believes that this ruling is highly unusual. He filed an appeal with the High Court at approximately 6:00 PM on the 26th, with a separate statement of reasons, requesting the reversal of the retrial ruling. Upon hearing this news, the reporter rushed to interview both the Chief Justice and the Chief Prosecutor. Chief Justice Sun stated that the system of prosecutorial review in Chinese jurisprudence is inherently independent. Since the prosecutor deems the case inappropriate and has filed an appeal, the court should, in accordance with the law, seek instructions from the Supreme Court for a final decision. Chief Prosecutor Han stated that judgments rendered after three trials cannot be challenged again according to the law, and the ruling for a retrial in this case appears to lack a legal basis. Furthermore, regarding the facts, Chu Minyi's claim of loyalty to the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and his purported efforts to preserve historical documents should not be grounds for applying for a retrial, as he engaged in acts that endangered the nation's foundations and obstructed the war of resistance. Therefore, the prosecutor's appeal should await the final decision of the Supreme Court. The reasons for the appeal are listed below:</p>
<p>Grounds for Appeal</p>
<p>Prosecutor's Appeal Statement, Jiangsu High Court; Defendant: Chu Minyi. Regarding the defendant's case of treason as a collaborator, this court issued a ruling on June 22, 1946, to initiate a retrial. This prosecutor received the delivery on the 24th of the same month and believes that an appeal should be filed. The reasons are described below: The original ruling to approve the initiation of a retrial was based on the appellant's claim that the defendant went to Beijing in 1942 to negotiate with the Japanese army to retrieve the remains of the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and enshrine them in the mausoleum. He also allegedly exerted efforts in Shanghai to retrieve the original manuscripts of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's works, including "Sun Wen's Theory" and the handwritten "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction," which had been confiscated by the Japanese army. The Nanjing Ninghai Road Detention Center has detailed records of these events, which concern loyalty to the Father of the Nation and the preservation of historical documents. This falls under Article 3 of the Regulations for Handling Cases of Traitors and Collaborators. The original final judgment did not consider these factors. According to Article 28, Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Case Procedure Law, there should be grounds for a retrial. However, loyalty to the Father of the Nation lies not in the enshrinement of remains but in the observance of his will, not in the preservation of writings but in the adherence to his teachings. The Father of the Nation dedicated forty years to the National Revolution, aiming for China's freedom and equality, and seeking to unite with nations that treated China as an equal to jointly struggle. The Father of the Nation's will is crystal clear. Since the defendant colluded with collaborators and enemies after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, organized a puppet government, resisted this country, and attempted to plunge our nation into endless suffering, these are facts confirmed by the Supreme Court's review. His actions clearly contradict the Father of the Nation's will and represent the greatest disloyalty. His negotiations with the Japanese army to retrieve the remains of the Father of the Nation and recover his writings were the same as his organizing of the puppet government, secretly infiltrating the Kuomintang, and misappropriating the name of the National Government. It was all a ploy to win popular support, confuse public opinion, and achieve his aim of undermining the war of resistance and resisting this country. This is a common tactic of treacherous officials and rebellious subjects, and there are numerous examples throughout history. If the War of Resistance is won, the Father of the Nation's writings, even if confiscated by the enemy, will undoubtedly be returned. If the war is lost and the nation falls, even if the Father of the Nation's writings are preserved, there will be no way to implement them. According to Article 3 of the Regulations for Handling Cases of Traitors and Collaborators, a traitor who has assisted in the war of resistance or performed acts beneficial to the people may have their sentence reduced if there is conclusive evidence. Furthermore, Article 28, Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Case Procedure Law, which allows an appeal for a retrial in favor of the convicted person, requires that important evidence that could influence the judgment was omitted from consideration after the judgment became final, resulting in a significant error. The provisions of these articles are very clear. Even if the defendant's negotiations with the Japanese army to retrieve the remains of the Father of the Nation and recover his writings were true, as mentioned above, his actions did not assist in the war of resistance and were not beneficial to the people. Furthermore, the defendant used the guise of loyalty to the Father of the Nation to win popular support and undermine the war of resistance. Considering his methods of committing the crime, according to Article 57, Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Code, he should be punished severely. The original final judgment considered this and sentenced the defendant to the death penalty, which was not a significant error. The appellant's request for a retrial is clearly unfounded. The original ruling was approved hastily and cannot be considered appropriate. Therefore, within the statutory period, an appeal is filed, with the reasons stated above. Prosecutor Li Shudong, Jiangsu High Court, June 25, 1946.</p>

<h3>Minister Gu and Chairman Wang Arrive in Nanjing, Report on Inspection of Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Minister Gu Zhenggang and Chairman Wang Maogong, after distributing flour to refugees in Zhenjiang on the morning of the 26th, took the Beijing-Shanghai express train and arrived in Nanjing in the afternoon to report to the central authorities on the refugee relief efforts in northern Jiangsu and the inspection of Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Taizhou, and other places. They will also travel to Xuzhou, Haizhou, and other places on the 28th to continue comforting the refugees. Before the Communist army devastated northern Jiangsu, the refugees in Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Taizhou, and other places were mostly landlords, wealthy merchants, civil servants, or honest farmers. Subsequently, due to the Communist army's implementation of "three alls" (kill all, burn all, loot all), "three capitalizations" (nationalization of land, industry, and commerce), "three leveling" (leveling of wealth, education, and class distinctions), and bloody "struggles," they fled en masse and became starving refugees. Even small vendors and poor people fled because they were unwilling to be driven by the Communist army. Currently, a million refugees in northern Jiangsu are wandering the streets day and night, dying of disease and starvation. They are very grateful for the government's relief efforts, but their urgent request is for the government to protect their return home. Thousands of refugees often follow Minister Gu and Chairman Wang, shouting slogans such as "Please, government, protect our return home."</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang Refugee Relief Committee Plans to Develop Sha Island</h3>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Bank Provides Loans to Northern Jiangsu Refugees</h3>

<h3>Wang Wenti, Son of Traitor Wang Jingwei, Sentenced to One and a Half Years in Prison, Granted a Five-Year Suspended Sentence with Probation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The case of Wang Wenti, the traitor and son of Wang Jingwei, was pronounced by the Capital High Court on the morning of the 26th. The main text of the judgment is as follows: "Wang Wenti conspired with the enemy to resist this country and is sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for five years, and all property is confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for the family. Wang Wenti is granted a five-year suspended sentence and placed on probation during the suspended sentence period." Presiding Judge Zhao Chen explained the reasons, stating that the defendant was young and inexperienced and followed his father into treason, serving as a lieutenant colonel in the puppet government. However, he did not engage in active acts of treason, and his sentence should be reduced by one-half in accordance with the law. Furthermore, he was misled into the path of treason, and his situation is not without pity, so his sentence should be further reduced. Since the defendant has not been previously sentenced to imprisonment, he meets the conditions for a suspended sentence and is therefore granted a suspended sentence. Zhao also stated that Wang Wenti, who is placed on probation during the suspended sentence period, should know to correct his mistakes and start anew, emulating the merits of his father's first half of life and not dwelling on the traitorous acts of his father's second half of life. In five years, he should be able to graduate from university, and upon the expiration of the suspended sentence, he will still be considered a "new person who has not been previously sentenced to imprisonment" according to the law. Wang Jingwei's son, Wang Wenti, repeatedly acknowledged this and retreated without expressing any other opinions. According to the Capital High Court, if there is no appeal, he will be released on bail within ten days of the delivery of the judgment and handed over to the police bureau for execution.</p>

<h3>Guo Xiufeng's Retrial Postponed, Deng Zuyu to be Sentenced on the 29th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Capital High Court publicly tried Guo Xiufeng, the former Deputy Secretary-General of the puppet National Defense Supreme Council and President of the puppet Central News Agency, this morning. Because the defendant's lawyer did not arrive, after a brief interrogation, the court ordered a retrial to be rescheduled. Deng Zuyu, the former Governor of Jiangxi Province, has been tried and the sentence is scheduled to be pronounced at 2:00 PM on the 29th.

<h3>Commander of the Navy Warship Command, Chief of Staff Wei, Goes to Nanjing to Report for Duty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Report] Wei Jimin, Chief of Staff of the Navy Warship Command, patrolled the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea defenses aboard the Changzhi warship on the 11th of this month. While heading to Qinhuangdao in the Bohai Bay, he received a telegram and returned to defense. On the 24th of this month, he arrived in Shanghai aboard the original ship and went to Nanjing on the evening of the 26th to report for duty. The reporter interviewed Wei before his departure, and he provided a detailed account. Wei's inspection area extended from Qingdao around the Shandong Peninsula through Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Bohai Bay to Qinhuangdao. According to Wei, coastal defenses constructed by the Communist army were visible along the coast of Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other places. Bunkers and military fortifications in the mountainous areas were also clearly visible. The civilian ships and fishing boats encountered along the way were all escaping from the Communist-controlled areas along the coast. Their accounts of the Communist army's atrocities matched the facts recorded in the newspapers. According to the boatmen, the Communist army tightly controls civilian ships and fishing boats in the Communist-occupied areas along the coast and does not allow them to leave their original docking locations. If ships are used for passenger transport or fishing, three guarantors must pledge that the ships will return to their original locations before they are allowed to depart. Therefore, the boatmen under the Communist rule along the coast are extremely miserable.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Attitude of the Chinese People Toward the United States</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a United Press Washington dispatch stated that a State Department official said: "Reports from Moscow Radio that the United States and China have a 'secret agreement' to extend Lend-Lease to November 1947 are without basis here." It also stated: This news may be based on a misunderstanding of the wording of the bill currently under consideration by Congress; this bill will allow the President to provide China with military assistance and necessary supplies for its military to 'fulfill the obligations of the United States under the United Nations Charter.' Congress may authorize the President not only until October 1947, but also for ten years thereafter; at the same time, if Marshall's peace process proceeds smoothly, the Communist army will also receive assistance before formal unification is achieved. As we read this dispatch, Mao Zedong was publicly making anti-American remarks in Yan'an, stating that American military aid to China is armed intervention and demanding that the United States immediately cease military aid to China and withdraw American troops stationed in China. At the same time, anti-American slogans have been discovered in this city, and some American military personnel have been surrounded and verbally abused by a small number of people; the occurrence of these incidents is truly unfortunate. Given the occurrence of these anti-American slogans and behaviors, in order to express the general intent of the Chinese people, we must expose the truth of this despicable offensive and express our attitude.</p>
<p>First of all, we want to declare that these anti-American slogans and behaviors are the work of a few scoundrels and cannot represent the general intention of the Chinese people. In the effort to defeat the Japanese invaders, Chinese and American youth fought shoulder to shoulder; the traditional Sino-American friendship has become more solidified and close after this baptism of blood. In terms of the spirit of nation-building, national character, emotions, and even geographical environment, no two nations are as close as China and the United States. Although China's War of Resistance against Japan has been victorious, the great cause of the National Revolution has not yet been completed; in order to complete our revolution, we need the assistance of a great brotherly nation like the United States. The Chinese people deeply express their gratitude for the various efforts of the United States in China, especially for the various efforts of the highly regarded five-star Marshal Marshall. If the Chinese people have any other feelings besides gratitude towards our great neighbor, it is that they feel that American aid to us seems to be insufficient, which may be due to their excessive expectations. Therefore, any anti-American sentiment is not spontaneous among the Chinese people; any anti-American sentiment cannot represent the sentiments of the general Chinese people.</p>
<p>The Moscow "Red Star" published an article on the 22nd commenting on the situation in China, criticizing American aid to China and launching anti-American rhetoric. This is not the first time for Soviet newspapers. In "Izvestia," in "Pravda," and in "Red Star," which represents the voice of the Red Army, there are often anti-American arguments. The anti-American propaganda offensive that has appeared in China is to some extent related to the anti-American rhetoric in Moscow. Why do we say this? The Chinese people have a traditional friendship with the United States, and this friendship has been further solidified and strengthened by the war. The Chinese people themselves will never have anti-American sentiments. This can be asserted. In order to cover up its crimes, the Chinese Communist Party does not want a fair third party to see its various illegal acts, and it communicates with Moscow, so it launches anti-American rhetoric and launches an anti-American propaganda offensive. This is a tactic of the Communist Party, and this tactic is more from the Mecca of the Communist International than from Yan'an. From a broader perspective, the anti-American propaganda offensive that has appeared in China is not a spontaneous sentiment of the Chinese people, but echoes the anti-American offensives that have appeared in other parts of the world, and they are interconnected.</p>
<p>It is in this sense that the actions of the Communist Party are actually contrary to the interests of the nation. We must raise the awareness of the people about the Communist Party. Obvious traitors like Chen Gongbo are now being punished by national law; and there are invisible or inconspicuous traitors among us. Even if the intellectual level of the Chinese people is low, they have the ability to distinguish between obvious facts in the past. The Chinese people also have a clear understanding of who is a friend and who is an enemy, and their inner tendencies cannot be concealed.</p>
<p>What we find even more interesting is that the anti-American rhetoric of the Moscow "Red Star" and Mao Zedong's anti-American remarks not only echoed each other remotely in time, but their content was completely consistent. Is this really the voice of the Chinese people? We hope that the Chinese people will use their discernment and not be echoers of others; those who blindly follow should understand how they are being used and harming the country, and should turn back in time. As for our American friends, we trust that they have the ability and wisdom to discern this disguise. Due to the unfolding of this internationally-motivated anti-American offensive, the people of China and the United States should have a deeper understanding of each other and a closer cooperation; the maintenance of world peace is built on this foundation.</p>

<p>Amidst Territorial Disputes in Italian South, American 10,000-Ton Warship Opens Port in Trieste - Strengthening Power to Prevent Incidents - Hopes for Success of Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting Increase</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch] London, 26th - Broadcasting: US Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's secret talks on the Trieste issue are concluding. The Four Foreign Ministers' meeting is moving towards a brighter path. According to sources close to Byrnes: "Byrnes is extremely satisfied with the results of his consecutive meetings with Molotov, and believes that the hope of success for the current Foreign Ministers' meeting is now higher than it was eleven days ago." On the other hand, to prevent any disturbances in Trieste, the US Mediterranean Fleet has prepared everything. At the same time, British and American troops are frequently being deployed in the Trieste area.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 26th] The US Navy Department announced last night: The American 10,000-ton cruiser "Vicksburg" is currently en route from Malta to Trieste. A Navy Department spokesman did not disclose the reason for this move, but it is generally believed that the American warship's arrival there is to strengthen the power of British and American warships in the Gulf of Venice. This area is currently the territory that Italy and Yugoslavia are vying to acquire. According to news from Trieste this morning, there are currently as many as ten British and American warships anchored in the Gulf of Venice.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 26th] The only achievement of today's formal meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers was the adoption of a clause stipulating that the United Nations' claims for compensation against Italy could be paid from Italian assets.</p>
<p>Italian Government Authorities Issue Declaration - Determined to Fully Safeguard Sovereignty - Saragat Elected Chairman of the Constitutional Assembly</p>
<p>[United Press Rome, 25th] The newly elected Italian Constitutional Assembly held its first meeting today and elected a chairman. Orlando, the only surviving member of the "Big Four" at the Versailles Peace Conference, served as chairman. Approximately 500 members of parliament attended. As a result of the vote, Saragat, former ambassador to France from the right-wing Socialist Party, was elected with 401 votes against 67 votes. Saragat is 48 years old and served as a minister without portfolio in the first provisional government, opposing cooperation with the Communist Party. The most noteworthy aspect of today's meeting was the unanimous demand to retain the disputed area of Venezia Giulia. Chairman Orlando declared that no material force or immoral transactions could separate Trieste and other towns in the area from Italy. According to Orlando, the threat to national survival today is more terrifying than at any time in history. The treatment proposed for Italy by the Paris Foreign Ministers' meeting is an insult to the tens of thousands of brave men who died in battle, making them slaves to fight for foreigners who still regard us as enemies. If this is the case, a shadow will be left on the honor of those who called us to fight, lasting for centuries. Premier Gasperi continued to announce that he had stated at the Paris Four Foreign Ministers' meeting that the Italian people would never tolerate this dismemberment. If the peace treaty conditions are too harsh, the United Nations will risk extinguishing the light that the world urgently needs and returning it to darkness.</p>

<p>Amidst Atomic Bomb Tests, Unmanned Aircraft Show Their Might</p>
<p>4,000-Pound Mysterious Bomb Appears</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, on board the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb test observation ship, 25th] Bikini Atoll will be bombed by an atomic bomb on or after July 1st. Four observation posts are built around the reef, equipped with steel towers, calorimeters, loudspeakers, radio measuring devices, and cameras capable of taking 3,000 pictures per second. Unmanned aircraft will ascend into the air when the atomic bomb explodes, and will be remotely controlled by aircraft with pilots five miles away. The closest distance for human observers from the explosion site is sixteen miles, and they will wear lead vests for protection.</p>
<p>[United Press, on board the atomic bomb test observation ship Appalachia, 25th] The Army's newly created 4,000-pound mysterious bomb, which was not used on the battlefield, will be exposed to the atomic bomb explosion at Bikini on July 7th to determine whether the atomic heat and explosive force can detonate it.

<p>Conference on Utilization of Atomic Energy Opens in the United States</p>
<p>Economic Power Source - Especially Needed by the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[United Press Estes Park, Colorado, USA, 25th] The International Conference on the Management and Utilization of Atomic Energy opened here today. Dr. Reade, Professor of International Law at the University of Chicago, said that solving the problem of international management of atomic energy is more important to the Soviet Union than to the United States because the Soviet Union is vast and lacks cheap coal. Although the economic use of nuclear energy as a power source is not yet certain, it is known to be more widely used than coal. Areas such as Siberia, where there is no cheap coal supply, will soon prove it to be a very valuable power source. Reade argued that atomic energy should be managed by an international committee of the United Nations, whose nature is similar to that of an international court.</p>
<p>UN Atomic Energy Commission Establishes a Twelve-Person Subcommittee to Draft an International Atomic Energy Plan</p>
<p>[US Information Service New York, 25th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission today unanimously agreed to establish a twelve-person working subcommittee to study all proposals on the control of atomic energy and then report to the Commission. The subcommittee is scheduled to meet this Friday.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 25th] Polish representative Lange tonight announced at the UN Atomic Energy Commission that he supported the Soviet proposal to ban atomic bombs. According to Lange, the Polish government fully supports the proposal of Soviet representative Gromyko last week, which stipulates the signing of a treaty to immediately ban the manufacture, storage, or use of atomic bombs and to immediately destroy such weapons anywhere in the world. Earlier, French representative Parodi declared that the French government, in principle, supported the US proposal for atomic control and banning of atomic bombs.</p>
<p>Before the Control Plan Is Established, the United States Will Never Give Up Secrets</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] The Soviet Union's desire to have its way on the atomic issue has caused the UN atomic energy control to be stalled, and the US Congress is also shocked by this. Several members of Congress solemnly declared that the United States will never give up its atomic bomb secrets until international control methods are established. The Soviet plan does not guarantee the international control layer. The Soviet Communist Party-run Pravda accused the US atomic bomb international control plan of being a disguised attempt to win world hegemony, which has aroused severe rebuttal from the Senate Atomic Energy Committee. Democratic Senator Russell said that the Soviet Union should stop judging others by its own petty standards. The US plan is generous and willing to give up the inventions we have acquired with our talents and money. All we seek is to protect the world and ourselves from being used for all kinds of destruction. I firmly oppose revealing a word of information before a control plan is established, and I believe that the majority of members of Congress share this view.</p>

<p>British and American Scientists Launch a Unified Measurement System</p>
<p>[Reuters Cambridge, 25th] Scientists from Britain and the United States will soon hold talks to seek a unified measurement system, and it is generally hoped that the French system will be adopted. However, because the current differences in the measurement system are too great, it is advocated that a new agreement should be stipulated separately. This issue was discussed at the recent Imperial Science Conference, and some people at the conference also suggested that the United Kingdom should establish a standard radio frequency system together with the United States to meet the needs of the Empire.</p>

<p>[Reuters New Delhi, 25th] The Executive Committee of the Muslim League decided tonight to join the Indian Provisional Government. At the same time, after deciding to accept the long-term plan of the British Cabinet delegation, the Congress Party Executive Committee instructed the prime ministers of eight provinces, informing them that the Congress Party has the right to select candidates to participate in the election of the Constituent Assembly.</p>
<p>[United Press New Delhi, 25th] The Indian Congress Party today took emergency steps to elect candidates for the Indian Constituent Assembly. After the British proposal to form a provisional government of fourteen people was rejected, a question has arisen as to what kind of government India will form during the existence of the Constituent Assembly. Some people expect that the original proposal to form a provisional government may be completely abandoned and discussed separately, and officials may make a formal statement on this within a few weeks. The British side once declared that whether the two major parties in India refuse to participate in the provisional government alone or together, the British side will still proceed to form a provisional government that can "fully represent all aspects." At the same time, it is also learned that the Congress Party has notified the prime ministers of the eight provinces to order them to elect candidates for the Constituent Assembly, and the candidates will be selected from the provincial assembly according to the population ratio of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs.</p>
<p>Three Ways to Alleviate the Situation</p>
<p>[Reuters New Delhi, 25th] The Governor-General of India met with the Chairman of the Muslim League, Jinnah, today to inquire whether the Muslim League can consider making concessions to the demands of the Congress Party at a time when both parties have agreed to long-term suggestions. If the Muslim League accepts the temporary plan and makes no further concessions, the three paths that the British Cabinet delegation and the Governor-General can choose are: (1) to organize a temporary administrative conference, (2) to reopen negotiations on temporary issues, or (3) to postpone the organization of an administrative conference during the election of the Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p>[Reuters New Delhi, 25th] Gandhi said at a prayer meeting today that it was untrue that the Congress Party Executive Committee accepted the long-term plan of the British Cabinet delegation against his opposition. But Gandhi also said that his mind had been very confused for the past four or five days, and he only saw darkness, and he did not know where this fear came from. Therefore, he informed the Congress Party Executive Committee of this situation and asked them to decide for themselves without regard to his opinions. He hoped that the people would invite and follow the decisions of the Executive Committee, and when he could see the light again, he would inform the masses. But during the period when he was surrounded by darkness, he hoped that others would not fall into the same environment as him.</p>

<p>[United Press Seattle 25th] The Wages and Working Hours Committee of the World Maritime Conference today passed an amendment to the international minimum wage, acknowledging in principle that the work efficiency of Chinese and Indian sailors is inferior to that of other sailors. Therefore, their wages should be reduced proportionally. The U.S. representative insisted on "equal work, equal pay," but most representatives, led by British employers' representative Mr. Sneeden, replied that giving Chinese and Indian sailors a full minimum wage would be unequal work and unequal pay, unless the work efficiency of sailors from these countries is equivalent to that of other sailors.</p>

If the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union can ultimately achieve sincere understanding and cooperation, it will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the world. It seems extremely difficult for some countries that have never suffered aggression in modern times to fully understand the emotions of victimized countries and the determination to prevent Germany from aggression again, but we must make them thoroughly understand this situation.</p>

<h3>International Tribunal Continues to Hear Testimony: Japanese State Minister Kijūrō Shidehara Provides Detailed Information on the Inside Story of the Mukden Incident</h3>
<p>Truth About the March Riot Revealed</p>
<p>[Kaizosha Tokyo 26th] The Far East International Military Tribunal continued to call incumbent State Minister Kijūrō Shidehara to testify today, with cross-examination by defense attorney Van Nierop. (Question) You said that Shigemitsu and T.V. Soong negotiated to seek a peaceful resolution when the Mukden Incident broke out. Please tell me the details. (Answer) What the defense attorney said is all that I remember. (Question) Why was this effort blocked? (Answer) It was probably due to inconsistent opinions within the Chinese government. There were no problems within the Japanese government at that time. (Question) Is it true that Shigemitsu made the greatest effort to seek understanding between China and Japan? (Answer) True.</p>
<p>After the Incident (Question) After the incident, did the Japanese government receive reports regarding the movements of Japanese troops in the Northeast? (Answer) We received reports from the consulate-general in Manchuria. (Question) Did you receive reports after the troops had moved? (Answer) We also received reports before the movement. (Question) Even though the Japanese cabinet and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received these reports, they could not suppress the Japanese military? (Answer) That's right. Defense attorney Klaessens asked: Did the Privy Council also have no control over the military's actions in Manchuria? (Answer) No. The cabinet could notify the military of the cabinet's attitude through the Minister of the Army, but the Privy Council did not even have this function. (Question) Is it true that the indictment states that after November 13, 1931, the Japanese government approved of the invasion of Manchuria to expand its territory? (Answer) After resigning from the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs, I only knew the news reported in the newspapers. Next, prosecutor Helen questioned: After you received reports from the Kwantung Army about gathering troops and weapons in Manchuria, what measures did you take? (Answer) Because the situation was serious, I strongly requested that Army Minister Minami take appropriate measures. He also expressed his opposition to this and agreed with my opinion.</p>
<p>Military Rampage (Question) What measures were taken as a result of the conversation with General Minami? (Answer) The result was that there was no effect on the control of the military. (Question) Did the Northeast Incident occur after the conversation with General Minami? (Answer) Yes. (Summary) Who in the cabinet should be responsible for this military action? (Answer) I think the Army Minister should be responsible. The cabinet did not know about the September 18th Incident on the day it occurred. At the cabinet meeting that day, the Army Minister promised to investigate and reply. (Question) Who did the cabinet receive reports from regarding the military's actions? (Answer) The Army Minister. (Question) Who did the cabinet receive reports from regarding the September 18th Incident? (Answer) We received a written report from the Army Minister about two days later. (Question) What policy did the cabinet adopt when the incident occurred?</p>
<p>Cabinet Policy (Answer) The policy was decided to prevent the incident from continuing and to prevent the incident from expanding, and a statement was sent to the League of Nations accordingly. (Question) Who participated in the decision of this policy? (Answer) The entire cabinet. (Question) What actions did the Army Minister take based on the cabinet's policy? (Answer) I believe that the Army Minister made appropriate instructions for the non-expansion policy. (Question) What policies did the cabinet order the Army Minister to implement? (Answer) The cabinet could not instruct the Army Minister? (Question) Was the cabinet's policy implemented? (Answer) The incident could not be prevented. I believe that General Minami did his best, but the expansion of the incident is a fact. (Question) Who was the commander of the Kwantung Army at that time? (Answer) I knew from the newspapers that it was General Honjo, but I don't know if General Honjo really had power. (Laughter in the hall). (Question) Was General Honjo summoned because of the incident? (Answer) No. (Question) Were any of General Honjo's subordinates punished? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) Who was the ambassador to China at that time? (Answer) It seems to be Shigemitsu. (Question) Was the Northeast Incident resolved between China and Japan?</p>
<p>Sought Resolution (Answer) It was not resolved. Shigemitsu and T.V. Soong made efforts, but they were stopped due to inconsistent opinions within the Chinese government. (Question) To what extent did the military act? (Answer) Initially, it was only along the railway line, but later it expanded to Jilin. By the end of the Wakatsuki cabinet, it had extended to Jinzhou. Next, defense attorney Kiyose cross-examined: Was it the Chief of Staff who controlled the military, not the cabinet or the Army Minister? Regarding major issues, I know that the Chief of Staff and the Army Minister negotiated, but regarding "military operations," isn't it legally within the Chief of Staff's command authority? (Answer) As far as I know, regarding military operations, the Chief of Staff executes it after imperial approval (approval by the Emperor), but in fact, he consults with the Army Minister beforehand. (Question) Do you admit that the Army's actions are legally the responsibility of the Chief of Staff? (Answer) I don't know if it is solely the responsibility of the Chief of Staff. Because of the consultation, the Army Minister should also share responsibility. At this point, the questioning of Shidehara came to an end.</p>
<p>March Riot Incident</p>
<p>[Kaizosha Tokyo 26th] After questioning Shidehara today, the International Tribunal proceeded to investigate the famous March Conspiracy Riot Incident, which had never been revealed, and called witness Kiyonaga Yukinosuke to testify. Kiyonaga had long been involved with various nationalist groups. In 1919, he returned to Japan from China with Kita Ikki, Iwata Tomi and others, and joined the Daikaikai. In 1924, he organized the Dagyosha to engage in the Japanese national essence movement. Prosecutor Helen first read Kiyonaga's confession: "(1) I returned to Japan with Kita Ikki in 1919 and introduced Kita Ikki to Okawa Shumei. (2) Until March 1931, Okawa often met with Hashimoto Kingoro and other army officers at the Kinryutei tavern. According to Okawa, these officers aimed to reform the Japanese government and attempted a revolution. I donated 2,000 yuan to Okawa for this purpose. My task was to throw bombs outside the Diet building when Okawa and others held demonstrations. Okawa had planned to lead soldiers into the Diet to occupy the government.</p>
<p>Three Hundred Bombs According to Okawa, Hashimoto obtained about three hundred bombs from the army, and I stored them. (3) Later, Okawa said: This plan failed because the army officers involved in the conspiracy backed down. Okawa also revealed that General Ugaki had participated in the plan. When Okawa told Koiso, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, that the plan had failed, Koiso replied: "The abandonment of this plan is based on direct orders from the army." Later, at the request of Marquis Tokugawa Yoshichika, the bombs were returned to Colonel Nemoto Hiroshi of the General Staff Headquarters. (4) On a certain day in August 1931, Okawa said: "I will launch some kind of incident in Shenyang with Colonel Kawamoto Daisaku, Military Police Captain Amakasu, and Lieutenant Colonel Itagaki, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army." (5) After being released from prison in December 1932, I met with Okawa several times. Okawa was extremely busy organizing the Jinbuto. The party was an extreme nationalist group with the aim of expelling white people from Asia and reforming the Japanese government. Around March 1932, Okawa said: "I am jointly involved in some kind of conspiracy with young naval officers and Kitsu Kosaburo who are dissatisfied with the Japanese government." I said that I would not be able to participate in the plan in the future." After reading it, defense attorney Ricks cross-examined: What is the relationship between Koiso and Nemoto? To whom were the bombs returned? (Answer) At the request of Marquis Tokugawa, I asked Koiso for instructions on how to return them. As a result, the bombs were returned to Lieutenant Colonel Nemoto, who was the head of the press corps at the time. (Question) Were there any other plans of this kind after the March Incident? (Answer) I don't remember whether it was the following year or the year after that, Okawa again talked to me about naval officers and the Ibaraki farmers' group launching some kind of action and ordered me to participate. I opposed it in light of the failure of the March Incident.</p>
<p>May 15th Incident Later, I learned that Okawa had participated in the May 15th Incident. (Question) What is the relationship between this matter and this war? (Answer) There is no relationship. (Question) What did Okawa say to you about the outbreak of the Shenyang Incident? (Answer) Although he did not tell me explicitly, he said while drunk in a bar: "Although the March Incident failed, something interesting will happen in Shenyang recently." (Question) Did Okawa talk about the content of this "something interesting"? (Answer) Although he did not say it explicitly, I understood it by common sense. (Question) What do you mean by understanding it by common sense? (Answer) It means that I understood it without being told. Next, Shimizu answered the questions from Hayashi Ichiro, the defense attorney for the defendant Hashimoto Kingoro: The goal of the March Incident was to criticize the Seiyukai and Minseito, which at the time neglected the happiness of the people for the sake of party politics, and had no aggressive nature. (Question) Is there a clause in the Jinbuto's program to expel white people from Asia? (Answer) No. (Question) In your confession, you said that the Jinbuto aimed to expel white people from Asia, which is different from your testimony at this moment. Which is true? (Answer) That was the general perception of society at that time. (Because Shimizu did not give a clear answer and did not answer the question, the solemn courtroom was filled with laughter, and although Hayashi Ichiro repeatedly questioned him, Shimizu did not give a clear answer in the end and had to give up.)</p>
<p>Next, Tokugawa Yoshichika was called as a witness and his confession was read out: "I am familiar with Okawa and have discussed the issue of advocating the Showa Restoration with him.</p>
<p>Expel White People He once described pan-Asianism and the oppression of Asian peoples by white people. In 1931, I discussed with Okawa a plan to place militarists in positions of power in the government. In mid-February of that year, Colonel Kawamoto Daisaku of the Army came and said that he was ordered by Koiso, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, to ask me to meet with Okawa and persuade them to abandon the plan to place the government under the military. Okawa acted in accordance with the military's intention. A few months later, Koiso said that Shimizu refused to return the three hundred bombs used in the March Incident, so I persuaded Shimizu to return them." Next, the defense attorney cross-examined: Was Major General Koiso the planner of this plan at the time? (Answer) I don't know the details. (Question) Did you know the performance of these bombs at the time? (Answer) I only learned later that they were fake bombs that could not kill people. (Question) In the confession, there is a phrase "placing militarists in positions of power in the government." Did you often use this expression? (Answer) I have never used the word militarist. (Question) What is the meaning of the so-called militarist? (Answer) It means using the power of the military. Okawa believed at the time that without the use of military power, the dark politics of the time could not be broken.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Economic Crisis Is Imminent: Foreign Merchants Jointly Send a Letter and a Proposal to the Mayor; High Prices and High Wages Need to Be Resolved Urgently</h3>
<p>Representatives of British commercial groups in Shanghai, Mr. Keswick; Dutch commercial groups, Mr. Dueri; Swiss commercial groups, Mr. Bolito; Norwegian commercial groups, Mr. Hoge Cao; French commercial groups, Mr. Schacaud, and others recently jointly wrote to Mayor Wu Guozhen, and attached a proposal, which detailed the high prices, high wages, and labor disputes caused by labor issues, etc., which have resulted in excessive production costs in the city, shrinking production, and an imminent economic crisis, a situation which is extremely serious. The translation of the proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>Full Text of the Proposal</p>
<p>(1) We are very willing to offer some suggestions on Shanghai's economic problems, especially regarding high prices, high wages, and disputes caused by labor issues. (2) The cost of living index published by your municipal government has recently increased sharply. In May, it was 52.02%, much higher than in the past few months. In short, the cost of living index has increased by at least 4,000 times compared to 1936. (3) During this period of inflation, foreign exchange rate controls were also implemented at the same time. The approved value of U.S. dollars has only increased by 593 times compared to its value before 1936. (4) Inflation and foreign exchange controls have created a three-fold unfair result: First, the impact on foreigners, and we believe that the Chinese people are also affected. Whether in private life or in business, we all feel a considerable loss in consumption. Second, the production cost in this city is too high, and it is simply impossible to manufacture products due to competitive prices. Third, the reason why manufacturing costs are too high is due to labor problems and transportation problems, not to mention exports. (5) This situation has continued for about six months, and it is a very clear and constant deterioration. Therefore, we can assert that if Shanghai's economic situation cannot be improved in the next few weeks, most enterprises in the city will reduce their business scope or close factories and offices in order to maintain the minimum state. This action is certainly not what entrepreneurs want to do. (6) As a result, unemployment will increase sharply, and tens of thousands of people will have no work to do and no way to make a living. This crisis cannot be treated with a calm and composed attitude. The mayor has repeatedly explained the dangers of high prices and high wages (making it difficult for general employers to pay their employees). If this situation is not improved, the collapse of the economy can be expected soon. (7) If we do not report this reality to the mayor, we will not only let down ourselves, but also the municipal government and the labor community. From the perspective of citizens, we also deeply feel that we should share the responsibility of working together in times of difficulty. In order to protect the happiness of the employers, the unfavorable economic situation should never be allowed to continue to shroud the city of Shanghai. Presenters: Mr. Keswick, Representative of British Commercial Groups; Mr. Dueri, Representative of Dutch Commercial Groups; Mr. Bolito, Representative of Swiss Commercial Groups; Mr. Hoge Cao, Representative of Norwegian Commercial Groups; Mr. Schacaud, Representative of French Commercial Groups.</p>

<h3>The Largest Shipyard Will Be Established in Wusong</h3>
<p>The Resources Commission has decided to establish a shipyard at the mouth of Wusong River, opening up China's largest dock. The factory director, Zhou Maobai, and his technical staff visited Wusong a few days ago to survey the base and immediately drew up the chapter plan. The dock will open up northward from the Taiwanese Yang Wharf of Wusong Fort in the east, and from Haihua Park in the west, all the way to the border of Baoshan County, including the old site of China Public School and more than twenty villages. The dock area covers a total area of more than 2,000 mu. After the completion of this project, it can build military vessels of up to 20,000 tons. The project can be started as soon as the land to be encircled is negotiated with the Ministry of Interior for the promulgation of expropriation methods. However, the Taiwanese section of the Wusong Railway has been blocked by the shipyard and can only通至蕴藻浜為止. Also, the scenic line of the Three Gorges Water and the bathing beach will have to detour to reach. Covers an area of more than 2,000 mu</p>

<h3>Garrison Headquarters Interrogates Ren Xingyai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] There were no new developments in the grain loan case yesterday. After Wang Daren and Ren Xingyai were transferred from the District Prosecutor's Office to the Garrison Headquarters, the Military Law Office interrogated Ren Xingyai alone yesterday afternoon. The progress of the case appears to be somewhat stagnant. No decision has been made on when the trial will formally begin. In recent days, the Military Law Office has been sorting out the results of the investigation on the one hand, and waiting for instructions from higher authorities and the reply from the Grain Department on the other. According to the Garrison Headquarters, the grain loan case is being handled on the orders of President Chiang and should be tried under military law, not an ordinary judicial case.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctors Go to Beijing to Petition Regarding the Examination Yuan's Deadline for Review</h3>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Medical Practitioner Law in the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), this city has been in a state of occupation, and no traditional Chinese medicine doctors, Western doctors, or dentists in the city have applied to the Examination Yuan for review. As a result, the majority of licenses issued by the Municipal Health Bureau are temporary licenses, valid until December 30th of this year. There are more than 1,600 temporary licenses for traditional Chinese medicine doctors in the city. The review procedures are cumbersome, and the guarantee requirement is difficult to implement. In addition, the Nanjing Examination Yuan has only recently returned to its capital and progress is slow. The Municipal Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctors has repeatedly discussed this matter in meetings and yesterday decided to send Chen Cunren, Cheng Diren, and Zhang Zanchen to Beijing to petition. They will begin to handle the review matters as soon as a practical solution is obtained.</p>
<h3>Young Women's Association Welcomes Two Ladies</h3>

<h3>Theater Industry Went to the Municipal Government Yesterday to Request a Reduction in the Entertainment Tax</h3>
<p>There are more than 90 theaters in this city. The entertainment tax set by the authorities is too high and difficult to bear. The limited ticket prices make the industry's income too low to cover expenses. The industry association recently decided to appeal to the authorities to adjust the tax again and decided to suspend operations automatically in all city theaters starting July 1st. At 10:00 yesterday morning, representatives Zhou Jianxing and four others went to the Municipal Government to appeal for adjustments. Secretary-General He met with them on behalf of the government. The representatives proposed: (1) After the curfew is lifted, the theater operating hours are still limited to 11:00 PM. A request for adjustment. (2) A request to cancel the price limit. (3) A request to reduce the entertainment tax. Mr. He said that the first two points could be addressed, but the third point was unacceptable. Zhou and others are scheduled to go to the Municipal Finance Bureau and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau this morning to make further appeals, and a general meeting will be held this afternoon to discuss the next steps.</p>
<h3>Living Burial Case Concludes - Sentencing Scheduled for Early Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zheng Zhenghua from Xuzhou, who lived in Zhangjia Lane, Meilong Town, worked for the enemy's military police and abused his power to harm innocent people. On the evening of November 16th of last year, township head Sun Fuxiang accused Zheng of being a bandit and instigated villagers Yu Fubao and four others to break into Zheng's bedroom, drag him to the Luo Wang Temple, beat him violently, and bury him alive near the Xianren Temple to vent their accumulated resentment over the years. Later, his wife Yu Jumei sued the Garrison Headquarters, and Sun and Yu were arrested and sent to the District Court. During the trial yesterday morning, the defendant claimed that Yu Jumei made false accusations because her extortion attempts failed. After a detailed inquiry, the court scheduled sentencing for July 3rd.</p>
<h3>There are More Than Four Hundred Rental Cars in the City - The Issue of Leasing Jeeps is Still Under Consideration by Various Car Companies</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] There are 33 registered taxi companies in the city, with a total of 407 cars. They include: Xiang Sheng 62, Asia 13, Xin Xin 2, China United Industries 20, An Tai 12, Hu Dong 2, Shun Feng 14, China Traffic 9, Tong Li 7, Xin Zha 15, Da Lai 19, Hu Nan 15, Gong Da 13, You Ning 6, Hua Li 3, Dong Hua 24, Zhong Hua 19, Shanghai 7, Central Xinglong 31, Hai Da 10, Da Hua (number of vehicles not yet registered), Fei Yun 29, Zhong Shan 9, Yangzi (number of vehicles not yet registered), Kai Li 18, Dong Fang 4, Yi Tai (number of vehicles not yet registered), Hu Jia 20, Ka De 9, Fuzhou (number of vehicles not yet registered), Lü Bao 10, Xin Sheng 5, and Bai Le (number of vehicles not yet registered).</p>
<p>In fact, the total number of taxis in Shanghai is more than this, as some private vehicles are operating under the names of the above-mentioned car companies, but are not listed during registration. The business of all car companies is very prosperous, because cars are faster and cheaper than other modes of transportation. At the beginning of the peace, it cost 1,600 yuan every twenty minutes, later increased to 2,400 yuan, but customers still flocked to the doors, often having to queue and wait, and even quarrels occurred. The vehicles are running outside all day and rarely have the opportunity to return to the company for rest. Recently, due to rising prices, the car companies planned to increase the price to 4,000 yuan, but the Social Affairs Bureau only approved an increase to 3,600 yuan, so negotiations are still ongoing. Currently, the daily wage of a driver is about 1.7 yuan. According to the worker's cost of living index, the average employee's monthly salary is about 60 yuan, also calculated according to the worker's cost of living index. Currently, no new cars or materials are being imported from abroad, so the replacement and repair of damaged vehicles is a problem. Recently, the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan plans to allocate 1,500 jeeps to various car companies to organize a joint company at a price of US$1,600 per vehicle. The car companies believe that jeeps are not suitable for winter and rainy weather and will inevitably need to be modified. They are also concerned about future operations after the import of new cars and whether the car companies can complete the installment payments within two years. Therefore, the terms are still under consideration.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to the person in charge of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, someone has applied to the bureau to order a large number of jeeps from the United States, modify them slightly, and then rent them out publicly. However, the US military has an order restricting jeeps for military use only, so the Public Utilities Bureau has no authority to approve this and is currently seeking instructions from the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Two Typhoons Brewing - Beijing and Shanghai Areas Will Be Affected</h3>
<p>The second typhoon of this year disappeared after landing in Wenzhou, but there were still strong winds in this city. The reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory of the Central Meteorological Bureau again yesterday. According to the interview, the strong winds that have hit this city for several days are due to the fact that after the typhoon, a high-pressure system rose from the North Pacific to the north of the Yangtze River, while a low-pressure system south of Jiangxi flowed into the Beijing and Shanghai areas. The combination of high and low-pressure systems caused strong winds. After the typhoon north of Palau Island disappeared, another strong typhoon is brewing in the eastern part of the island. At the same time, there is also a typhoon brewing in the South China Sea, but the direction, wind force, and speed are still unknown and may be determined today. According to predictions, the wind force will exceed the last one, and the Beijing and Shanghai areas may inevitably be affected. The daily reports of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tropical air currents cover the entire country. The Pacific Ocean is still stable in Japan, Ryukyu and Hwatoo Mountain Bird. Tropical low-pressure areas or possible typhoons are northwest of Palau.</p>
<p>Weather forecast: Haze in the Yellow Sea, brisk easterly winds, moderate to giant. Sea waves.</p>
<p>Central China: Cloudy, partly overcast, with thunderstorms, moderate variable winds, fog in the morning. Shanghai: Overcast, sometimes cloudy and hot, haze and fog in the morning, gentle southerly winds. East China Sea: Cloudy, brisk easterly to southerly winds, moderate to locally heavy seas.</p>
<p>Temperature on the 26th: Highest 91.1 degrees, lowest 79.2 degrees.</p>
<h3>Many Good News - Don't Lament the Lack of Cars - The Public Utilities Bureau is Working Hard - Public Buses Will Greatly Increase</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Four red temporary public buses officially joined the existing Route 3 on the 21st of this month. These vehicles were purchased from Xiang Sheng Automobile Company. The company also has a number of group buses that may be sold to the Public Utilities Bureau for use as temporary public buses. It is reported that the French Public Bus Company will soon have twenty new public buses on the market, which can be shipped from France in mid-October. The Public Utilities Bureau will set up fixed parking lots at appropriate locations.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Public Bus Preparatory Committee of the Public Utilities Bureau added four new red cars purchased from the United States to Route 3 at the end of last week. Since the operation started, passengers have found it convenient. It is reported that the committee has recently purchased twenty public buses from the Supply Bureau and is currently modifying them. All work is expected to be completed at the beginning of next month. Whether to add them to the existing routes or open new routes is still undecided and will be submitted for a vote at the meeting on Tuesday next week. During this hot summer, for the convenience of passengers traveling early and late, all buses returning to the factory from Beijing Road Bund every night from 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM, and from the Old North Gate from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM, will charge each passenger only 150 yuan in legal tender and can go directly to the factory address on Fair Road Broadway Road. From 6:00 AM to 7:00 AM every morning, the same price will be charged when the army leaves the factory, and passengers can also take the bus. However, it is a direct ride when entering and exiting in the morning and evening and there are no stops along the way. Furthermore, in order to assist passengers in adopting opinions, passengers can submit their complaints or suggestions for improvement in writing and send them to the Transportation Section, 150 Tanggu Road. Those who submit the letter must indicate their name and address.</p>
<h3>Shao Shuhua, Former Deputy Manager of the Pseudo-Central Reserve Bank, Sentenced to Ten Years - Lu Xihou and Others Guilty of Improper Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Shao Shuhua, one of the four former deputy managers of the pseudo-Central Reserve Bank, was sentenced yesterday afternoon. The main text of the judgment stated: "Shao Shuhua, conspiring with an enemy country to attempt to resist this country, is sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for ten years, and all property, except for a reasonable amount for the necessary living expenses of family members, shall be confiscated." Lu Xihou, Zhao Shiqian, Huang Chuwei, and Zhao Yuntai, four suspected traitors who were managers and senior staff of the pseudo-China Stadium, were also sentenced at the same time. Due to improper jurisdiction, they were transferred to the District Court.</p>
<h3>Wu Liande Scheduled for Retrial</h3>
<p>In addition, Wu Liande, the boss of Liangyou Pictorial Company, was previously sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for serving in a pseudo-occupation. He appealed for a retrial. The case was re-examined yesterday and sentencing is scheduled for the afternoon of July 3rd. The case of suspected traitor Fu Hongyuan will be sentenced on the morning of the 29th.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Trial of Various Treason Cases</h3>
<p>In addition, the treason cases of Le Jiajun, Jiang Yougen, and Zuo Ming were also sent back for retrial by the Supreme Court and have been tried. The treason cases of Xu Jianping, the former general manager of the pseudo-Central Trust Bureau, Zeng Guangyan, the former head of the pseudo-Huaihai Province Education Department, and Ren Ke have also been interrogated and adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Yang Guangzheng to Be Tried Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court will hold its first trial of "cultural traitor" Yang Guangzheng and others at 9:30 this morning.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Enforcement on the River Still Feels Weak</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The reporter met with Wu Kexiao, the director of the Municipal River Police Sub-bureau, yesterday to discuss the bureau's recent work and anti-smuggling situation. According to him, the sub-bureau is authorized to have 600 police officers, but currently, in order to improve the quality, they must pass a middle school level exam and then receive training, so there are only about 200 qualified working police officers. The bureau has three sub-stations and eleven police stations on the Huangpu River. There are currently seven patrol boats, all of which are old and dilapidated. Three of them are damaged and are still under repair, which has an impact on the work. Of the remaining four boats, each of the three sub-stations has one, leaving only one for the sub-bureau. They patrol the river surface alternately during the day and add double shifts at night to work around the clock. As for anti-smuggling, it is only to assist the customs police. Recently, a large number of tax-evading American cigarettes and candies have been seized and handed over to customs. Wu also said that Shanghai's environment is complex. After a hundred years of concessions and eight years of enemy and puppet rule, coupled with the influence of gang forces, it is by no means an overnight task to completely eradicate the evil forces along the river and docks.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ke, Former Deputy Minister of the Pseudo-Propaganda Department, Responds Like a Lecture - Zhang Tao, President of the Pseudo-Supreme Court, Tried - Struts About, Golden Teeth Gleaming, Speaks Rudely</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Ke, a 43-year-old from Hangzhou, graduated from Columbia University in his early years and later studied politics at the University of Berlin. After returning to China, he served as a private secretary to Chen Youren. After Hong Kong fell, he was captured and lived in Shanghai for many years. Later, at the invitation of Lin Bosheng, he took office as the Deputy Minister of the Pseudo-Propaganda Department for four months and ten days. After resigning, he published the "Dagong" weekly. After being interrogated by the High Court, the trial was concluded yesterday afternoon. The defendant spent a long time defending the indictment, with ups and downs, as if giving a loud lecture. The content can be divided into two points: (1) During his tenure as Deputy Minister of the Pseudo-Propaganda Department, he never published texts or gave speeches promoting the peace movement or praising the pseudo-occupation. (2) In his "Dagong" weekly, he tried his best to implement the tasks that he failed to implement during his tenure in the pseudo-occupation, and engaged in criticizing the puppet government and promoting the anti-Japanese war. He then listed the texts of the various issues of "Dagong" as evidence. The court then asked about his experience of joining the pseudo-occupation, and he said: "Lin Bosheng came to me and said, 'Wang Jingwei's illness is beyond cure. What should be done after his death?' I said that the only way is to dissolve the pseudo-organization and convene a meeting of people's representatives to decide. I then discussed it with Chen Gongbo and took office as the Deputy Minister of the Pseudo-Propaganda Department to carry out the task. Zeng Qi and Ji Sihao were also present during the discussion and knew about this. It was not me who insulted him." As he spoke, he was hoarse and exhausted, forgetting where he was, and was stopped by the judge. After being defended by lawyer Hong Shihao for free, the court ordered the debate to end and set the sentencing for 2:30 PM on July 2nd.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Tao, a 61-year-old from Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, is a member of the Kuomintang. He worked as a lawyer in Hangzhou and Shanghai for nine years starting in the 7th year of the Republic (1918), and also served as a judge in the Beiping Dali Temple and various levels of courts in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, he suddenly changed his allegiance. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), Wen Zongyao, Liang Hongzhi, and others organized the "Reformed Government" in Shanghai in an attempt to resist the Central Government. Zhang served as a pseudo-"Legislative Committee member" and "Chairman of the Economic Committee". In the 29th year of the Republic (1940), when Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and others organized the Nanjing Pseudo-National Government to establish a rebellious regime, he was transferred to the President of the Pseudo-Supreme Court until the enemy and puppet regime collapsed and he was arrested and brought to justice. When the High Court opened the trial yesterday morning, Zhang wore a lotus-gray silk long gown with self-spun silk shorts underneath, gray socks, black shoes, old-fashioned glasses on his nose, and a bamboo-bone fan in his hand. He strutted about, supporting himself on the defendant's bar with both hands. When answering the questions, Zhang opened his mouth and revealed two gold teeth, constantly saying disrespectful sentences such as "Is that so?" "The court understands?" The fan in his hand also danced, but it was taken away by the bailiff, and he lost a way to help express his emotions. According to Zhang, he and Chen Zemin were classmates and graduated during the reign of the Qing Dynasty. He later served in the legal profession. He joined the Kuomintang in the 13th year of the Republic (1924). When party member registration was held in the 17th year (1928), he was rejected because he was from the Xishan Conference faction, so he tore up his party certificate. Later, although he rejoined the party, he did not receive a party certificate. During his tenure as the Chairman of the Pseudo-Economic Committee, the Japanese side requested that ten major companies such as railways, telecommunications, and water and electricity be operated by Japanese merchants, but they were rejected by them, which shows that Zhu never harmed the country. As for the "Supreme Court", he said that it was just the judiciary and did not harm the country. He was dismissed from the court at around 11 o'clock and adjourned for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Qian Yongming Talks About the Currency System - Talk of Reform is Not Yet Timely</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] This reporter recently interviewed Qian Yongming, the chairman of the Bank of Communications, regarding his views on the current general economic and financial situation in the country. He said that the turning point in the current domestic economy and finance is still related to the resolution of the entire political problem. If the political problem is not resolved, national transportation cannot be smooth, and the economic and financial communication in various places will be isolated, and tax revenue cannot be restored, so the national finance cannot be balanced, and a deficit budget will appear. As for the talk of reforming the currency system, Qian believes that it seems impossible at present. Moreover, the currency system reform plan should be permanent and cannot be done repeatedly. Therefore, the talk of reform is not yet timely. Qian believes that the Central Bank's foreign exchange and gold policies are appropriate. However, he hopes that the Central Bank will pay more attention to China's internal remittance issues. Qian finally expressed optimism about the financial future of this city. He said that President Chiang is working hard for the overall political situation, and Special Envoy Marshall is also working tirelessly and mediating. Therefore, he hopes that all aspects of the country can be tolerant and united. He also hopes that those who often criticize the authorities' policies should actively participate in cooperation and express their opinions, and not just engage in empty criticism, which is of no benefit to the actual situation.</p>
<h3>People's Freedom Protection Association Investigates the Case of Students Being Beaten</h3>

<h3>Groundless Claim of 53 Organizations Sending "Representatives" to Beijing</h3>
<p>Reports indicated that Ma Xulun and others held a tea party for reporters in Nanjing on the 25th of this month, claiming that 53 units, including the "Textile Industry Labor Union of the Third District of Shanghai" from the "Shanghai People's Organizations," had jointly appointed representatives to petition in Beijing. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency inquired with the Social Affairs Bureau, which is in charge of people's organizations. They stated that the cotton spinning and weaving industries in Shanghai have always been organized separately, and there is no "Textile Industry Labor Union of the Third District." Even the original Cotton Spinning Labor Union of the Third District and the Cotton Weaving Industry Labor Union of the Third District were reorganized into factory unions and their official seals were returned and canceled. The so-called 53 organizations mentioned by Kui Yanfang and others were found to be organizations not approved according to law, obviously using false names and stealing public opinion. Furthermore, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's 9th Members' Congress, the All Shanghai Labor Circles Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance, and the Shanghai Student Union have all issued declarations denying that Kui Yanfang and others are representatives of all circles in Shanghai. It can be seen that these self-proclaimed representatives have no basis in reality, and the so-called "53 organizations" are undoubtedly a forgery.</p>
<h3>Refugees in Shelters Compete to Voice Grievances During Inspection</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The number of refugees fleeing from northern Jiangsu to Shanghai is increasing daily, and the issue of relief is urgent. Yesterday, a reporter inspected the shelter set up above the Xiaocaichang (Small Vegetable Market) on Dongjiaxing Road. The refugees surrounded the reporter, complaining that although the shelter had received relief flour once, it was insufficient to distribute due to the large number of people. Now, they only receive one bowl of thin congee per day, which is not enough to live on. Therefore, many refugees go out during the day to seek a living on their own, either pulling carts, working as laborers, or even begging to make ends meet. Among them are many ordinary people such as rural farmers, but there are also many who were "struggled against" until they became impoverished. Now that they have wandered to Shanghai, it is not easy to find even manual labor, so they urgently hope that the outside world can provide more relief. The shelter currently houses over two hundred people, living together in one place, and the hygiene situation is worrying.</p>

<p>Orderly</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were approximately ten thousand spectators, all of whom came to help with disaster relief. Military police and soldiers were dispatched yesterday. In addition to setting up posts at key intersections, there were also several lines of barbed wire. Therefore, the order was orderly. However, unruly fans roamed around outside the stadium until a quarter of an hour before the end of the game, when some spectators broke through the fence and entered. Fortunately, the game ended soon after. The lineups for the two teams yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>Qingbai</p>
<p>Huang Shijie</p>
<p>Yan Shixin Wu Qixiang</p>
<p>Qu Yongfu Meng Yiliang Gao Baozheng</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting Luo Choufu (up) Xu Deming (down) Xu Wenkui Gu Yiche Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>Kick-off Ceremony</p>
<p>The game started with the national anthem. Referee Zhang Le and Du Yuesheng stepped into the field, performed the kick-off ceremony, and moved the ball. The two armies made contact. Zhang Jinhai intercepted the incoming ball and ordered an attack. Meng Yiliang sat in the central hub, blocking the way. After five minutes, Fei Chunhua went deep alone. Huo Yaohua was unable to catch up in time. Xiao Fei tried his foot, but unfortunately, it was deflected and missed. Not long after, Luo Weizhao launched an uprising in the middle, shooting from 30 yards out, but it flew high over the goal. In less than a minute, Meng Yiliang mistakenly fouled the left foot Wang. Xu Jingcheng took a free kick from 30 yards out. The ball was steep and urgent, but it was still slightly deflected and went wild again. After ten minutes, Baozheng made a small pass to the right corner. Chunhua advanced along the sideline. When he reached a good spot, he lifted his foot and shot hard, but it was caught by Zhu Zhaoheng. The situation was average, with each side attacking and defending.</p>
<p>Xingdong</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaoheng</p>
<p>Huo Yaohua Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Luo Wei Xu Jingcheng Feng Kunsheng</p>
<p>Li Shuoyou Li Zhaorong Liu Songsheng Guo Yingqi Zhang Jinhai Feng Jingxiang</p>
<p>Penalty Kick</p>

Baozheng headed the ball to save the situation. Meng Yiliang touched the ball with his hand, violating the rules. Zhaorong took the penalty kick, and the ball entered the net from the right corner. 1-0, Xingdong took the lead in the first half.</p>
<p>Moving One Kick</p>
<p>After the charity ball auction and awards ceremony were completed, the two sides reunited. Xingdong played with the original lineup. Qingbai rested Luo Shoufu, and Xu Deming replaced him. After the start of the game, Qingbai's forwards attacked relentlessly. After two minutes, Qingbai got Yiliang's support and was about to pass the ball into the center when Jihua fouled, resulting in a penalty kick in the penalty area. Xu Wenkui took the penalty kick and broke through Xingdong's net in the upper left corner. 1-1, creating a tie. Two minutes before one penalty kick, and two minutes after another penalty kick, it was truly evenly matched and reciprocating courtesy.</p>
<p>Qiuting's Wonderful Hit</p>
<p>Qingbai scored, and their morale was greatly boosted. After nine minutes, Xiao Fei went straight in alone. Xiao Chuan made a pass to the left corner, and Cao Qiuting arrived in time, breaking through the enemy's barrier from about ten yards, making the score 2-1. Qingbai reversed the defeat to win. After fifteen minutes, Baozheng fell to the ground to save the ball, resulting in another foul. Zhaorong took the penalty kick but did not score. At that time, Yaohua withdrew, Shuoyou came on to fill the left wing, Songsheng moved to the forward, Luo Weiquan took the center, and Xu Jingcheng retreated to the left back. After this adjustment, Xingdong took the opportunity to attack fiercely, but it was still in vain. Two minutes before the end of the game, Wu Qixiang was violently hit by Luo Weiquan and left the field with a serious injury. Not long after, time ran out, 2-1, Qingbai defeated Xingdong again.</p>

<p>Another Match: Qingbai vs. Soviet Union - Starting at 4:00 PM at Yiyuan</p>
<p>At the invitation of the Small-Sided Football Committee, the Hong Kong Xingdong Football Team will play a small-sided football exhibition match against Western Union at Yiyuan Stadium at 5:30 PM today. The match will start at 4:30 PM, with another match between Qingbai and the Soviet Union. Qingbai has a strong team, and the Soviet Union is not weak either, so a fierce battle is inevitable. Tickets are sold for 2,000 yuan each, starting at 1:30 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium on Shaanxi South Road. It is hoped that the audience will maintain order so that they can fully enjoy a good game. In order to make the occasion grand, the organizer specially invited Xi Yushu to perform the kick-off ceremony. The Hong Kong Island athletes have special expertise in small-sided football, such as Xu Jingcheng, Zhang Jinhai, Deng Guangsen, and Guo Yingqi, who are unparalleled in the small-sided football field. Today, Xingdong intends to use the wheel warfare method to meet the tenacious Western Union. Moreover, it is the first time that the visiting team has performed small-sided football, so their excellent skills will surely refresh the eyes of the fans. Western Union is centered on Dai and Ka, with Olevira as the mainstay, and the forwards are matched with Robert Stov and Fafansiao, etc., gathering all the elite of the Soviet Jewish team. In addition, the Italian general Dai Douka, who has not been seen for a long time, is helping out, guarding the gate, which makes it even better. When the two heroes meet for the first time, the wonderful performance is inevitable. Today's order and the Xingdong and Western Union lineups are as follows:</p>

<h3>Joe Louis Boxing Match Broadcast on Television</h3>
<p>[New York Dispatch from the US News Agency on the 25th] The New York Times published an article on the 23rd, describing the television broadcast of the heavyweight boxing match between Joe Louis and Ilecon last week. According to the report, this was the first time that a championship match was broadcast on television. According to the report, the number of people who watched and listened to the match on television was greater than those who filled the Yankee Stadium, where the match was held. In New York, Philadelphia, Washington, and other places, those with television receivers could watch the match in their homes, clubs, or hotels. A few spectators numbered in the hundreds, and no fewer than three thousand boxing fans gathered at the RCA laboratory in Princeton to watch the boxing match. It is recalled that boxing match broadcasts began 25 years ago, when Jack Dempsey and Carpentier held a championship match in Jersey City. Since then, radio has made some progress. Last week's television broadcast was the latest development in this area.</p>
<h3>Political Issues Also Arise in World Tennis Championships</h3>
<p>Two Polish Players Have Nationality Removed</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The Warsaw government of Poland is attacking the political problems of Polish military personnel who are unwilling to return home, which has even affected the Wimbledon tennis tournament. Polish players Spiezchla and Taitzinski were originally subordinates of General Anders who refused to return home. Following protests from the Warsaw government, tournament officials have removed the nationalities of the two players. Spiezchla said: "Five people are about to be listed as stateless persons, but all we want is to play tennis."</p>

<h3>Import Goods Application Notice: First Review Completed</h3>
<p>Next Application Period Fixed - Do Not Order in Advance Before Approval</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is learned that since the Import Management Office has been handling the application for import permits for five items, namely automobiles, tobacco leaves, sugar, films, and kerosene, it has been stipulated that they will be processed in batches every quarter (three months). However, the application for import permits for the period from March 1st to September 30th of this year will be processed in one batch. The application for the period ended at the end of last month. After examination and assessment by many experts from the office, the import limits for the above five items during the period were all determined yesterday and have been notified to the applying importers by the office. It is also learned that for goods imported in each subsequent quarter, applications should be submitted to the office before the end of the second month of the previous quarter. The office may reject or reduce the approved amount of the application. Therefore, applicants should not order goods in advance before the approved amount has been approved. In addition, goods permitted to be imported in each quarter should be imported before the end of the next quarter, otherwise, the original applicant may not be approved for subsequent applications for permits. However, exceptions will be made for special reasons, but concrete documents must be submitted. This method is universally applied to both Chinese and foreign importers. (Chang)</p>
<p>Gold Price Without Special Changes - Hong Kong Dollar More Popular Than US Dollar</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold continued to stabilize. The centrally allocated price was slightly increased to 1.95 million yuan, with 245 bars allocated. People's confidence rose with the tide, becoming even more firm. The opening price in the morning already showed a slight increase. After the opening, in view of the monetary system reform, a slight clue was revealed. Buyers were still eager, and the price rose slightly to 1.965 million yuan before some long positions were sold off. In addition, due to the registration and allocation by the central government being related to the allocation price, buyers were slightly more cautious, but trading was limited and there was no significant change. At noon, the price fell slightly to 1.94 million yuan, and in the afternoon, it rose again to around 1.965 million yuan. As a result, the closing price was 15,000 yuan higher than the previous closing price. The price of gold jewelry was 1.08 million yuan, the price of refined silver was flat, and the interest rate ranged from 13% to 16%.</p>
<p>The US dollar was still difficult to stimulate. The opening price in the morning was flat. The opening price in the morning was flat. Midway, it rose slightly to 2,680 yuan, but it was only temporary. As the price of gold slightly decreased, it hovered around 2,650 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it rose slightly, but the rise was not as good as gold. As a result, the closing price was still slightly higher than the previous closing price by 10 yuan. The Hong Kong dollar was still popular, rising from 515 yuan to over 530 yuan. As a result, the closing price rose again by 12 yuan compared to the previous closing price. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose from 520 yuan to around 535 yuan. The good-looking Indian exchange rate rose to around 650. The British exchange rate was 8,500 to 8,000 yuan. Trading was still active in Hong Kong dollars, while the US dollar was flat and quiet.</p>
<h3>Public Bond Trading Sporadic</h3>
<p>Public bond trading remained sporadic. Due to the mutual squeeze between long and short positions, the overall trend was a seesaw situation. In fact, the asking price was far from reality. The short side did not want to linger and cause trouble, and they closed their positions one after another when they saw a profit. Although there were various naive and superficial so-called resolutions, the organization was loose, and informed colleagues did not pay much attention to it. Therefore, most people watched from the sidelines. Currently, those who are conducting over-the-counter transactions are mostly sporadic. The high price of the Unified C bond was 850 yuan, and the low price was 770 yuan. In the end, it still hovered around the previous day's price. Miscellaneous bonds continued to see an increase in the asking price. As a result, the price of the C bond was flat and weak, and the price of miscellaneous bonds was more stable.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market became more stable. The Huannan Gang returned, and Shuangma rose to 1.55 million again. The closing price was 60,000 yuan higher. The prices of the remaining 20-count medium and small yarns were mediocre, and there were not many transactions. At noon, the Fangjian Company opened yarn as usual. Blue Phoenix was available for sale in the 20-count yarn, and the price was 30,000 yuan higher than the Fengnian label in the previous period. The prices of the remaining various counts of coarse and fine yarns were similar to those in the previous period.</p>
<p>The momentum of serge and grey cloth remained strong. This was because the sales of customers were still able to be maintained, so people's confidence was good. Serge rose by 1,000 yuan due to the shortage of spot goods in the market. The dyers and customers also demanded fine cloth, so it also rose by 500 yuan. There was not much change in the rest.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained stable due to the continued shortage of spot goods. The Association divided the prices. The spot price of medium white sugar was 110,000 yuan to 111,000 yuan at first, and then 108,000 yuan to 110,000 yuan, an increase of 1,000 yuan. The road cargo was 108,000 yuan to 8,500 yuan, and then still 8,000 yuan. The warehouse receipt was stronger, 112,000 yuan to 1,000 yuan, and then 110,000 yuan to 109,000 yuan. The closing price was 110,000 yuan. The price of four and a half white sugar wagons was 168,000 yuan. In addition, a batch of enemy sugar was sold at auction for the 32nd time, totaling 120 ingots and 136 bags, 180 ingots and 750 bags, all for 86,000 yuan. Medium sugar 937 bags, 98,000 yuan, rock sugar 347 bags, 162,500 yuan, three and a half white sugar wagons 104 bags, 168,000 yuan, and 25 bags, 145,000 yuan, ground sugar 55 bags, 82,000 yuan. According to the Taiwan Company, the medium sugar previously opened on the previous day, the amount requested by the dealers was more than 30,000 bags, and it has been decided to supply the full amount. Among them, spot goods accounted for 25%, and road cargo accounted for 75%. Raw sugar also opened at 86,000 yuan, and the numbered goods opened at 30 packages of Diaoqing, 95,000 yuan, three rock sugars 60 baskets, 122,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan, Xinghua red sugar dozens of baskets, 105,000, Xinghua white 126,000 yuan, followed by 120,000 yuan to 118,000 yuan</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Arrivals Increase - Market Trend Stable</h3>
<p>The number of registered customers and goods in the rice market increased yesterday, totaling 2,506 piculs, an increase of 1,242 piculs compared with the previous market. Among them, there were 20 piculs of port sharp rice, 114 piculs of Wuxiang rice, 2,372 piculs of milled rice, and 452 piculs of rice that were transported and sold by rice dealers themselves. Therefore, the general trend remains stable as usual. (Yesterday, the reported decline in the market prices of Baiyuan and Yinyuan was an error by the rice market. The actual market prices have not changed.) The situation in the flour market is still stable, with an increase of 200 to 300 yuan. Wheat bran is temporarily flat. The early oil price was firm and the noon was slack, and the prices were similar. High-quality soybeans were still stable, and medium and low-quality soybeans were slow to sell, with prices falling by 500 to 600 yuan. Broad beans were stable, similar to tea beans. Sesame also had little change. Soybean cake Shantou was not strong in accepting goods, and rural sales were very slack. The market situation was flat. Zhou Shan Ningbo Shantou had no intention of making progress with wheat, and the market situation was softening.</p>
<h3>Speculation is Wonderful - Longs Come Out High - Stock Market Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market suddenly rose again. Day after day, foreign hot money joined in, and the Yongshen long company took the opportunity to sell off after the rise. Retail investors and new longs also began to waver. Yesterday, the market could not support and retreated. However, one or two unpopular small stocks showed their own activities and suddenly shone. The high price of Zhongfa reached 217 yuan and was traded. The high price was forced by the general trend and was slightly reduced, but the potential trend was still good. When the market opened in the morning, the highest prices were Yongshen 560 yuan, Meiya 3,600 yuan, Jingfu 255 yuan, Xinguang 277 yuan, and Qinxing 220 yuan. The lowest prices at noon were Yongshen 518 yuan, US dollars 3,200 yuan, Jingfu 218 yuan, Xinguang 230 yuan, and Qinxing 170 yuan, and then it was slightly flat. The unpopular medium and small stocks also stabilized and then slightly fell. As a result, the closing prices of Yongshen Meiya fell by half, and Jingfu Xinguang fell by about 10%. Qinxing fell by 15%. Among the unpopular medium and small stocks, Xinhe, which had to bear half of the subscription rights for bonus shares, fell by as much as 10%, and the decline of the rest was very small.</p>
<p>One part of the foreign stock industry was a securities gang. In view of the imminent closure of the customs, some were sold off and turned weak. Yisha retreated to 9,700 yuan as soon as the market opened in the morning, and the American Union fell to 8,400 yuan. The market continued to decline after the opening, and then rebounded slightly after the fatigue at noon. As a result, the closing prices of the British Union, Yisha Paper, and Asia each fell by 10%. Yihe Wheelock Steel fell by about half, and Yeguang fell slightly but was still small.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Industry Stagnates - Timber Inventory High</h3>
<p>Taiwanese tiles are also arriving. After the victory, general construction has not developed much. For eight years, the timber that has been accumulated in the mountains has been hoped to be used for construction after the victory. Unexpectedly, the opposite has happened to this day. Although the timber has now been transported to the city, there is no way to sell it, and the price of the goods is falling every day. It is said that in Hangzhou, the timber merchants who are waiting for sale in this industry almost have living expenses that exceed the value of the timber. Recently, more and more timber has been transported to Hangzhou, and the shipping to Shanghai and sales are mostly losses. Among the timber piled up in Hangzhou, Chu timber accounts for 40%, and Hui timber and western Zhejiang timber account for 50% to 60%.</p>
<p>Most of the timber merchants who operate Fujian round logs and other timber are not in the industry, and they still adopt the wartime single-gang operating methods. Therefore, there are quite a lot of the above-mentioned timber in Shanghai. Square timber is the main type of timber used in Shanghai, and foreign timber is the main type of square timber. The round timber is locked up, mostly in the winter of each year, relying solely on the needs of the countryside in northern Jiangsu for building houses. Usually, the sales volume is very small.</p>
<p>[Another News] A batch of Taiwanese tiles was previously shipped to Shanghai by Shanghai merchants, and the sales were quite good. It is said that another batch can be shipped to Shanghai for sale in early next month.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Silk Factories Have Already Started Operations, Sichuan Silk Unable to Export</h3>
<p>Because the situation in Zhejiang is relatively stable, various silk factories have already begun silk production. Several dozen loads of raw silk have been transported to Shanghai. The situation in Jiangsu is less stable and further, so fewer factories have started. As the China Silk Corporation requires export silk to meet standards, it notified all silk factories receiving loans last week to submit all raw silk produced to the company for collection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the actual amount of spring silkworm loans was 1,688,477 yuan, as previously reported. Now, according to the person in charge of the China Silk Corporation's business office, the He Feng Xie Ji Silk Factory, among the factories approved for spring silkworm loans, had a loan amount of 4,095,000 yuan. Therefore, the actual amount loaned was 1,694. Recently, new silk from Sichuan has been entering the market in large quantities. However, due to transportation difficulties, exports have been hindered. The market price has been declining daily, from 2,250,000 yuan per dan to 2,000,000 yuan, without buyers. Silk merchants are currently seeking ways to transport and sell it in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Artifical Silk Sales to have Separate Regulations</p>
<p>Our City: The CITIC Production Committee has recently received a considerable amount of enemy artificial silk from various locations. It is reported that CITIC, in order to prevent manipulation by a few and to enable both large and small businesses to bid, will slightly modify the sales procedures. Once the procedures are revised, the artificial silk will be put up for sale.</p>
<h3>Banking Law Should Be Revised Again, The Financial Industry's Way Out is in Political Stability: Important Speech by Mr. Li Fusun</h3>
<p>Shanghai is the economic center of the country. Since the victory, there has been an abundance of floating capital, turning it into a speculative market. The use of financial institutions' deposits has become a major issue. According to Mr. Li Fusun, Chairman of the Banking Association, since the enemy's surrender, the political situation has been unstable, transportation has been obstructed, and prices have soared. Under these circumstances, the financial industry has naturally failed to fully fulfill its responsibility of supporting industry and commerce, and its operations have also been less than ideal. Mr. Li emphasized that the way out for the financial industry lies in political stability. With political stability, transportation will be restored, materials will flow smoothly, industry and commerce will prosper, and the financial industry's business will naturally be able to exert its proper function. Mr. Li continued: Currently, most banks, in addition to handling remittances, invest in the commercial market, with very few loans to factories. A portion is diverted to loans for silkworms, cotton, and other industries. Some even take risks and engage in speculation. Regarding the issue of stabilizing finance, Mr. Li stated: He always adheres to the central government's policies and follows the regulations of the Central Bank. Mr. Li believes that the Central Bank's measures are very appropriate. Regarding the general proposal to adjust interest rates, Mr. Li said in an objective tone that this matter is not simple and should be studied more from a practical perspective. The reporter further inquired about his opinion on the revised Banking Law. Mr. Li stated that there is still a need for revision, saying: He is currently discussing with the Legislative Yuan the points that should be revised. Because of China's special circumstances, banking regulations should follow the British approach of leniency and should not adopt the American policy of stringency. Issues such as real estate mortgages should be re-examined and revised, and concrete decisions will be made soon, at which time new banking regulations will be promulgated.</p>
<h3>Tallow Oil Price Surge Unabated</h3>
<p>Tallow oil used to be in a sluggish market during the summer. Since the rise of soap factories, it has turned into a busy season. At the beginning of this month, soap production increased significantly, and sales became brisk. The market price has risen sharply, soaring by more than 20,000 yuan in two weeks. Although it now seems to be stabilizing, the lingering effects have not subsided, and there is still potential for further price increases. Furthermore, the buying and selling of goods has ended in our city, but dealers are in no hurry to lower prices and are waiting for higher prices. However, Hangzhou, Lanxi, Hankou, and other places have all reported price increases, so the price surge is unlikely to end soon. Sales prices of each shop have risen with market prices. The price of Heben tallow oil is 85,000 yuan, Neiping oil is 80,000 yuan, Duzhu is 78,000 yuan, Lanshan is 75,000 yuan, and Macheng oil is 72,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Textile and Construction Production Increase Plan</h3>
<p>Yarn and cloth about to be increased by one-half. Yarn debts rise sharply in various Nanyang locations</p>
<p>The Textile and Construction Company will soon increase production. The current daily output of cotton yarn is 1,000 bales and is expected to increase to 1,500 bales. The daily output of cloth is 18,000 bolts and is expected to increase to 26,000 bolts, an average increase of about one-half.</p>
<p>Recently, the cotton yarn market has fluctuated slightly, especially the 20-count Double Horse brand produced by the Shenxin Factory, which has risen to over 1.5 million yuan and is trending upward. It is understood that the cotton yarn market has historically been more stable than other prices. The reason for this fluctuation is due to the stimulation of other prices and the rise of gold certificates. The price of 20-count Double Horse brand in various Nanyang locations is as high as 2 million yuan per bale, so sales are relatively smooth, and prices are particularly high. It is reported that the daily output of cotton yarn sold by the Textile and Construction Company has been over 1,000 bales recently.</p>
<h3>Holders Hoarding Goods, Few Spot Cotton Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton telegrams continued to soar, rising sharply by 34 to 46 points per pound. The near-term price is USD 29.98, the forward price is USD 30.17, and the current spot price for middling is USD 30.612. The local spot cotton market outlook is high, because American cotton is rising ever more fiercely, and most holders are hoarding, making it difficult for both parties to reach an agreement, resulting in very few transactions. Only the Wuxi Shenxin Third Factory purchased 200 bales of ordinary middling cotton at a factory delivery price of 101,200 yuan. In addition, some flower shops offered 400 bales of Uruguayan cotton at a godown price of USD 50.</p>
<h3>Source of Low-Price Flour Becomes a Problem, Currently Suspended Temporarily</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Previously, due to the soaring price of rice, it was difficult for the common people to obtain food. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, led by Director Wu, specially requested the Shanghai Special Commissioner Office of the Ministry of Food to allocate 1,500 bags of flour daily for distribution to rice shops in the suburbs at a low price. The initial price was 200 yuan per catty, which was later reduced to 150 yuan. Each household was limited to a maximum of six catties per day, and each rice shop was allocated 20 to 30 bags per day, all of which were sold out. The general public benefited greatly, but the supply fell short of demand, leading to instances of rushing and jostling. The Bureau then consulted with the Civil Affairs Department and instructed the district offices to first investigate poor households and prepare to distribute flour based on tickets. This procedure was nearing completion, but the Ministry of Food Office has been ordered to close. The Office has formally notified that the low-price flour sale will be temporarily suspended. If it needs to be resumed in the future, it will be negotiated with the Storage and Transportation Department, but there are rumors that the Storage and Transportation Department is delaying its establishment. It is unknown whether the low-price flour can continue, as there is currently no certainty.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou New Zhenmei Tea, Over a Hundred Boxes Sold Yesterday</h3>
<p>Quoted at 160,000 Yuan per Load</p>
<p>Zhenmei green tea, which has been sold to Europe and the United States, has seen tea merchants actively returning and preparing to produce it since the victory of the anti-Japanese war. Wenzhou, Zhejiang, in particular, has the earliest tea leaf growth due to its geographical conditions. This year's new harvest has already been produced and transported to Shanghai a few days ago. Unfortunately, the high cost and tight foreign price limits have caused numerous export difficulties, and no transactions have been made thus far. Recently, tea merchants are still actively seeking ways to expand the market. Yesterday, over a hundred boxes were sold on the market, purchased by a certain tea shop in the city for trial sales, quoted at 160,000 yuan per load. At this price, the seller can still make a small profit, but export companies are likely to be less optimistic. As for various teas sold domestically, holders are determined to sell at high prices, but shopkeepers and stores on this street have enough in stock, so transactions are few and the situation remains stable. However, Taiwanese black tea and bud tea are selling extremely well in Yixing and Wuxi, and the market sentiment is being boosted.</p>
<h3>Fewer Marine Products Available</h3>
<p>The market for marine products has generally turned around, mostly due to obstructed transportation, which has led to a decrease in supply. Dried scallops, shrimp tails, sea cucumbers, dried oysters, and maw are rising in price. Vermicelli is particularly outstanding. Although the outlets for various groups are sluggish, the market remains firm.</p>
<h3>Flourishing Nanhua Line Transportation</h3>
<p>British Ship Brings Large Quantities of Paper Money</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Nanhua line is flourishing. Yesterday and today, large quantities of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and miscellaneous grains have been shipped to Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangdong. The China Merchants Bureau's Haiwan vessel left port yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, heading straight to Shantou, loaded with 30,000 bean cakes, over 1,770 bags of beans, 210 bags of sesame, 385 bags of wheat, 19 pieces of textile goods, and over 320 pieces of cotton yarn. The Taikoo Company's Hubei vessel sailed into port yesterday morning, also touching at Xiamen. Over a dozen rescue agency trucks were transporting goods to Xiamen, along with over 300 pieces of passenger cargo, textile goods, over 10,000 bean cakes, and over 1,500 bags of beans. Today, the company's Niuzhuang vessel is sailing to Guangdong, with a large quantity of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, totaling over 7,000 pieces. According to the current freight rates, the value is strongly around 280 million yuan. Including other miscellaneous cargo freight, this vessel's total freight income is strongly over 300 million yuan, breaking the unprecedented freight record on China's coast.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Blue Funnel Line's Haddington arrived in Shanghai yesterday from England, reportedly carrying 368 boxes of paper money.</p>
<h3>Siamese Economic Construction</h3>
<p>Using Surplus Rice to Exchange for Materials</p>
<p>[United Press, Bangkok, 25th] Due to widespread famine in Asia, the small country of Siam has leaped to become the most economically promising country in Southeast Asia. Siam is now preparing to collect rice equivalent to 18,000,000 pounds of foreign debt next year. Britain is importing 15,000,000 yards of cloth into Siam, which is urgently needed by any Asian country east of India. British and American military transport, agricultural, and financial experts are working hard to assist the country. The United States is preparing to supply Siam with USD 15,000,000 worth of trucks and other surplus military materials. In June, 800 railway cars and 40 locomotives will arrive in Siam. Military officials responsible for clearing surplus materials in the Pacific region are working hard to supply Siam's needs. On the other hand, Siam is also working hard to increase food planting and production with the assistance of experts.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Production Drastically Reduced</h3>
<p>Before the war, our tung oil dominated the world market. Production was 1.36 million metric tons per year. According to people in the industry, current production is only 20-30% of that. During the war, some tung oil production areas were destroyed by war. Even in areas that were not affected by war, most tung trees showed signs of withering. The reason for this is that rising food prices have led farmers in tung oil production areas to switch to planting miscellaneous grains. It is said that previously one dan of tung oil could be exchanged for four dan of rice. Currently, it can only be exchanged for one dan, so farmers' interest in planting tung trees has decreased, and production has also greatly decreased.</p>
<p>China's tung oil production accounts for more than 95% of the world's total production. Since 1934, China's tung oil exports have surpassed tea leaves, ranking first among export goods, contributing greatly to the national economy. In 1937, the United States imported over 174 million pounds of tung oil from China.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Launches Scientific Offensive to Destroy Locust Nymph Stronghold</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ji Shaolin</p>
<p>This newspaper's Tianjin airmail report, 23rd</p>
<p>Two rice-producing areas near Tianjin are Xiaozhan and Junliangcheng. The former was developed by Li Hongzhang's Huai Army, while the latter was the basis that the Japanese spent several years during our anti-Japanese war trying to build into a fully scientific and mechanized large farm of 500,000 acres. I would like to report on the situation of this large farm later. Here, the reporter is describing a recent disaster encountered in the Junliangcheng area - a locust plague. This locust plague spread over an area 40 li wide from east to west and 10 li deep from north to south. After its discovery, the Central Agricultural Experiment Station mobilized 27 technicians and obtained assistance from the Tianjin United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Office, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Branch Office, and the US Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin. After more than one hundred days of struggle, the locust plague was finally suppressed. Using scientific methods to control locusts was a first in this area.</p>
<h3>Locust Plague Originates in Yunliangcheng, Attacks in Two Directions</h3>
<p>The locust plague occurred in early June. According to subsequent investigations, this group of small animals originated from the Qilihai lake and marsh grassland area 30 li north of Junliangcheng. Initially, they attacked south in two directions, crossing dozens of li of wasteland and reaching the area near the old Jintang Highway. One route went to Zhang Guizhuang, 20 li west of Junliangcheng, while the main force rushed to Junliangcheng. At this time, they divided into four routes and attacked the Junliangcheng area head-on, each route ranging from 7 li wide to 3-4 li wide. Wherever the locust swarms went, the ground was almost entirely covered by these small animals, and crops were immediately devoured.</p>
<p>The reporter went to inspect the disaster area on the 22nd. A corn stalk left the deepest impression on me. The leaves of this three-foot-tall corn stalk had been completely eaten, leaving only a bare trunk, like a wooden stick stuck in the ground. Fortunately, the disaster was not very serious, because most of the wheat had already matured, and farmers rushed to harvest it after discovering the locusts. And just as the locusts were invading the rice seedlings in the irrigated area, they were suppressed. The autumn harvest crops were more severely affected, and some wheat also experienced a reduction in yield of several percent due to premature harvesting.</p>
<h3>Experts from Beiping Rush to Tianjin to Launch Annihilation Campaign</h3>
<p>The Central Agricultural Experiment Station in Beiping received a report on the 8th of this month. After an initial investigation, on the 14th, entomologist Liu Tingwei led 20 agricultural students and six teachers from Beiping to Tianjin to rush to the disaster area to begin defense and launch an annihilation campaign. Locusts can only fly after the fifth instar. Their diffusion ability can reach 200 li around. In the larval stage, they are called nymphs. Jumping, nymphs can advance one li per day. What was initially discovered in the disaster area were large numbers of third and fourth instar nymphs. In the last few days, there were swarms of adult locusts. According to Mr. Liu Tingwei, locusts have a habit of moving collectively in large groups. During the annihilation campaign, this characteristic was often used to kill them with medicated bait and insecticides. However, this time, the locust swarms entered the area between the old Jintang Highway and the Beining Railway. This area has crisscrossing ditches and overgrown reeds, and the locust swarms began to scatter. This was an unfavorable terrain for conducting the annihilation campaign. However, the reeds took the place of the crops and suffered the disaster, which can be said to be an advantageous area.</p>
<h3>US Marine Corps from Tianjin Use Fire to Attack Locust Nests</h3>
<p>In terms of tactics: This time, several different methods were used to control the locusts simultaneously. The main method was to spread medicated bait throughout the farmland and spray insecticides in the reed thickets. However, in order to capture and kill those flying locusts to avoid re-infestation in other areas within 200 li, the US Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin was mobilized to launch an offensive against the flying locust nests with the latest weapon, the flamethrower. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Office handled this negotiation and immediately obtained permission from the US military authorities. Thirty-five US Marines, carrying twelve flamethrowers, went to war on the 22nd. Because the reporter arrived in the disaster area a little late, he was unable to witness their battle. He could only make a post-war lament on those battlefields. The flamethrowers were concentrated on several reed ponds where the flying locusts gathered, with a total area of ​​more than ten mu. The burned reeds were scattered on the water, and dead locusts floated on the surface, seemingly offering no resistance to those flames. According to eyewitnesses, the results were exceptionally good. Afterwards, I patrolled the fields, and medicated bait was everywhere, and the corpses of locust nymphs were scattered all over the place. The sugar-coated arsenic lime was used to entice them to eat it, and as a result, their entrails were burned out and they died there.</p>
<h3>Beware of Their Return, Locust Plague Nearing its End</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Branch temporarily ordered a method of exchanging five catties of locust nymphs for one catty of flour to encourage farmers to capture and kill the locust nymphs, and has already collected 10,000 catties of locust nymphs. This locust plague can also be considered a cruel war. Now the main stronghold of the locusts has been destroyed, and the main force of the locusts has been defeated. The main 580 mu of rice paddies and 200 mu of variety trial fields have been preserved, and the locust plague is nearing its end.</p>
<p>The reporter asked Mr. Liu Tingwei about the places where locust nymphs in North China originated. He said that they mostly originated in the alluvial delta areas of the Yellow River basin, including the Tianjin area, the Weishan Lake area, the Pi (County) Qiu (County) area, and the Kaifeng area. He was not very optimistic about the outlook for this locust plague. He said: If the origin is not fundamentally treated, it may be rediscovered after autumn. It is said that flying locusts have a strong sense of homeland. Although the first generation of children fly to other places, the third generation will definitely fly back to the place of the first generation. Junliangcheng also has a common saying of "spring south and autumn north," saying that it goes from north to south in the spring and from south to north in the autumn. Will it make a comeback? The situation after autumn is worth noting.</p>
<h3>The 8th Transportation Group of Our Air Force in Tokyo</h3>
<p>— Zhu Minwei</p>
<p>It is early summer. The American soldiers at Atsugi Air Base in Japan are dressed like the American soldiers in Jiangwan, Shanghai, wearing yellow khaki military uniforms. At Atsugi Air Base, just like in Shanghai, Kunming, and Chengdu, small "jeep" cars scurry around, and large jeeps transport goods. The standardized clothing and actions of the Americans, as well as their robust physique and efficient work methods, have spread American pragmatism around the world.</p>
<p>Tokyo City Sightseeing</p>
<p>A jeep was specially driven over to spray the newly landed B-24 inside and out with DDT. Americans like to use their resources to implement their rules, without empty formalities or favoritism. (You naturally couldn't imagine visiting someone on horseback and then having the host order someone to wash the horse's entire body.) Then they asked:</p>
<p>"Is anyone guarding this B-24?"</p>
<p>"No. Our security guards are staying at the main airfield."</p>
<p>"Okay, we'll send an M.P. to guard it day and night for you."</p>
<p>Vehicles were dispatched to send Captain Qian's group to Tokyo. The major's car was a sedan, grass-gray in color, with sofas inside. Officers of captain rank and below rode in jeeps. From Atsugi Air Base, they traveled northeast on a gravel road for thirty miles to Tokyo. The jeeps were driven by Japanese drivers, while the sedans were driven by American drivers. The dust raised on the road was even thicker than in western China, but the road was very smooth, without any bumps. The hills on both sides of the road were entirely planted with terraced rice paddies, green across the mountains and fields, without a single patch of barren land. Passing through the urban area of Yokohama, seeing the shattered city scene bombed by American planes, one couldn't help but recall the fierce battles in the sky and on the ground eight months earlier. After arriving in Tokyo, the American military drove Captain Qian and others to a Chinese hotel. This hotel was formerly the Mitsui &amp; Co. Club. In Tokyo, where land is so expensive, the Mitsui Club, with its two gardens, occupied a total of eighteen acres, with ponds, rockeries, trees, and small bridges, creating a secluded environment untouched by the noise of the city streets.</p>
<p>On the 28th, Delegation Leader Zhu Shiming and Division Commander Dai Jian went to the Allied Headquarters in Nagoya for a meeting and to inspect the barracks of the Chinese occupation troops stationed in Japan. Qian Zulum and his group were left with free time for independent visits and travel. Everyone was visiting Japan for the first time, and as soldiers of a victorious nation in an occupied territory, everything had to conform to the customs of the occupying forces established by the Americans here. Therefore, everyone put on their military service uniforms, not combat uniforms, made of dark green serge, tailored in the style from their time studying in the United States. When going out, they always rode in sedans or jeeps according to rank. The first goal, of course, was to tour the streets of Tokyo.</p>
<p>After nine months of occupation, the traces of war in Tokyo's streets were no longer very visible. Most of the bombed-out buildings in the urban areas had undergone some artificial restoration. Although there were still broken walls and ruins, there were no piles of ashes. As for the roads, there were no longer any bomb craters, as they had long been filled and leveled with asphalt. The cars drove smoothly without bouncing anywhere. They visited the Ginza, the bustling area of Tokyo, Ueno Park, a scenic spot, and the Meiji Emperor's Mausoleum and Admiral Togo's Mausoleum in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Deep Impression</p>
<p>The Japanese people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation after the war are currently not much worse than before the war. This shows that MacArthur's approach is not that of a simple military man. MacArthur does not allow the existence of military affairs and heavy industry in Japan, but in maintaining the survival of the defeated Japanese people, this old general is doing his best to "let the Japanese work as much as possible and also let the Japanese eat their fill." Currently, rice in Japan is sold by the government, and people buy a fixed amount of rice at certain times. Of course, this amount is less than needed, but it can prevent the Japanese from starving to death. In addition, MacArthur's headquarters has enabled most of the silk and yarn factories in Japan that can be put into operation to start working, and is also finding markets in the United States for Japanese products, and even using ships to transport these Japanese goods to exchange for American flour, so that bread can fill the stomachs of the working Japanese people.</p>
<p>Because the Japanese people lost the war, they don't pay attention to appearance and just wear whatever they can. Almost all men of military age wear short and tight Japanese military uniforms, with narrow-brimmed caps that cover their eyebrows, like the Japanese prisoners we saw in Beijing, Shanghai, and along the Yangtze River, except that all the rank insignia have been removed. Most women wear Western-style clothing, like the Japanese women commonly seen in the Hongkou area of Shanghai, and some also wear a type of flight suit with a top and pants.</p>
<p>They themselves are determined by one thought: "After losing the war, everything has to start from scratch, like craftsmen facing a destroyed house that has fallen in a storm, knowing that hard times lie ahead for a long time, and this starting point is certainly even harder!" They are also very quiet, because the house has already collapsed, and instead, a layer of fear of destruction has been removed. Just look at their leisure of fishing near "Sukiyabashi" (bridge name), and you can see this.</p>
<p>The Japanese people naturally can't talk about dignity, so they simply abandon face. In Chinese restaurants or other Japanese cafeterias, Qian Zulum and his group gave the leftover squid to Japanese female diners, who gratefully accepted and ate it. Because they were eating a bowl of plain rice, and considered it a luxury to be able to buy an egg to eat with their meal.</p>
<p>Later, they visited Atami Onsen. The meticulousness of the Japanese transportation system and the density of the countryside, mountainous areas, and forests left a deep impression on them. If China wants to catch up with this defeated island nation, just these two things alone will require some persistent spirit and arduous years. (16th, Shanghai)</p>
<p>The United States began selling these mobile homes in June, priced at US$4,685 each, to meet the housing needs of returning civilians. (Special dispatch from the New York Times.)</p>

<h3>I Too Want to Discuss National Affairs</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I have witnessed that left-leaning writers in current newspapers and magazines tend to attribute problems to the government, which deeply and severely influences people's hearts. Driven by patriotism, I cannot bear their confusion of right and wrong and want to discuss today's national affairs with them.</p>
<p>Currently, when people talk about the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, they often blame the Kuomintang. Many extremists even believe that the Kuomintang has a hundred faults and not a single merit, while the Communist Party has a hundred merits and not a single fault. Those of us with a little reason and conscience can no longer tolerate their distortion of right and wrong and must express our opinions:</p>
<p>(1) No More Delay! - Opposition to the civil war is the unanimous demand of the entire country. What is the reality? After many people's mediation, several negotiations, and several cease-fire agreements, fighting always stopped and started again, negotiating while fighting, and fighting while negotiating. Such negotiations and such cease-fires have been going on for ten months since the victory, and the people of the whole country are still suffering from the pain of war, unable to return home as refugees, unable to stabilize their lives, experiencing economic panic, and facing obstructed reconstruction. The people are unanimously criticizing the government, and the government is also distressed that the entire financial budget cannot be balanced and that economic measures are always constrained. The root cause is the failure to unify the national transportation, the inability to circulate goods, and the inability to popularize government decrees, right? So, from the government's perspective, it must also detest the civil war. The current path to peace is for the Communist Party to lay down its arms and for the government to reorganize. If both sides compromise in this way, the whole country can be peaceful and unified, and both parties can compete for power democratically. Based on the current situation, the Kuomintang may still be the dominant party, and it is not difficult to regain lost popular support by innovating and striving for governance. The Communist Party, having no confidence in seizing power, pins its only hope on worsening the chaotic situation, dragging it out until the people have no means of livelihood. At that time, the people will no longer believe in the government or tolerate the reality, and then the insurgents will think that the perfect opportunity has arrived. Seeking peace in this way is like climbing a tree to catch fish! - Therefore, we appeal to everyone that the current situation can no longer be delayed, and the national question must be resolved within the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(2) The Northeast Should Be Received in Its Entirety. Receiving the Northeast is based on the Cairo Declaration, the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the government's consistent policy since September 18th, and the unanimous demand of the entire country. Therefore, only the government that is currently recognized domestically and internationally can receive sovereignty over the Northeast; it is legitimate, just, and a matter of course. Anyone who attempts to seize the Northeast is plotting something illicit. After our fervent appeals and the just and stern support of friendly nations, it was finally easy to see the Soviet troops withdraw from the Northeast and the normal national army go to receive it. However, the Communist Party, under the guise of the people's name, forcibly occupied the Northeast and hindered the government from exercising sovereignty. Why should we tolerate this behavior that disregards the overall national situation? Among the Communist Party's absurd theories, similar to their use of the meaning of "democracy" and "freedom," there is something called "the sovereignty of the people" and "the force of the people." Anyone with a little knowledge knows that they have abused the meaning of sovereignty, and there is no need to explain it here. Just ask where this "force of the people" came from? It was not heard of when the enemy and puppets occupied the area, nor when the Soviet army entered the area. It only came out from underground when the national army was receiving it. Isn't that recognizing the wrong target? In addition to demanding that the government immediately receive the entire Northeast, we cannot recognize any new puppet regime's political power or military force.</p>
<p>(3) Give Marshal Ma the Power to Judge. - Who is the fairest? Of course, it is the people. However, there are too many opinions from the people, and it is difficult to hear the opinions of the truly majority of the people. As for Marshal Ma, of course, some people will attack him as an American. However, in this chaotic situation, the only one who is more of an outsider standing outside of right and wrong is the American. So why does the United States care about China's situation? Because in the current world situation, only if China is peaceful can there be peace in the Far East, and only if China is strong can the world be stable. Moreover, a chaotic China will breed a source of war, and a weak China will be coveted by powerful neighbors. Therefore, Americans are concerned about China's interests, which is also caring about America's own interests. Americans seek their own safety, and indirectly must make China safe. Because of this, we recognize Marshal Ma as a qualified mediator. "Political democratization and nationalization of the military" are the demands of the Chinese people and also the conditions for reconciliation put forward by Marshal Ma. Since we agree with Marshal Ma's position and Marshal Ma's proposals, in order to avoid delays, we must give Marshal Ma the power to judge. After the Political Consultative Conference, the Communist Party, on the pretext that the Second Plenary Session was unfavorable to them, took advantage of Marshal Ma's return to his country, forcibly occupied Weichun in the Northeast, and sabotaged the cease-fire agreement in North China, which led to today's situation. As for whether the government attempted to breach the agreement, it is only the Communist Party's speculation. However, the Communist Party truly breached the agreement first! Where does the fault lie? There is a public opinion on its own. Roughly speaking, the reason why the Communist Party is still unwilling to accept Marshal Ma's judgment lies in this.</p>
<p>(4) Why Does the Communist Party Attack Allied Nations? - The Communist Party says that the United States interferes in China's internal affairs, hinders China's sovereignty, and loudly calls for "American troops to withdraw from China," etc. These arguments can easily make people agitated. However, upon careful reflection, isn't this the Communist Party's refusal to accept Marshal Ma's power of judgment and its attack on the U.S. military for transporting troops for the government? I will explain this as follows: (1) No one can deny that the U.S.'s mediation in our civil war is an interference in our internal affairs. The reasons why we are willing to do so, in addition to what was said in the previous chapter, are only painful self-reproach, engraved in our hearts! The country has now been brought to this point. May I ask, is there any other way besides this worst option? (2) As for the United States hindering China's sovereignty, I don't know what it is referring to. Apart from the fact that we voluntarily gave it the power of judgment, there seems to be no situation similar to the Soviet Union in the Northeast. However, the Communist Party does not blame the former but blames the latter, which is too much of a distinction between importance! (3) The work of the U.S. military stationed in China is to recover prisoners of war and assist China in receiving its sovereignty, and perhaps the latter is more important. Now, the Japanese army has indeed completed its surrender, but the Northeast is still a problem. Frankly speaking, the United States does not want the Northeast to become the Balkans of East Asia. The stationing of U.S. troops in China is currently a stabilizing force. Apart from the Communist Party, which has ulterior motives, no one dislikes the U.S. military being stationed in China at this time. (4) The Communist Party also says that the U.S. military transports troops for the government, which will expand the civil war. We think that if the government had not recovered Changchun, there would have been no room for negotiation at all. It seems that if there had been no Americans to transport troops for us, not to mention receiving the Northeast, we would not have been able to set foot in North China! What would the situation have been like then? We must admit the facts. It is precisely because of the U.S. troops stationed in Qingdao, Dagu, and other places that the civil war in North China was not expanded. It is because of the strengthening of the national army in the Northeast that the ground for today's negotiations has been preserved. If it is wrong for the U.S. military to transport troops for the government, then the Communist Party should also think about how the "Northeast Allied Army" was established. If there had been no initiator of this, the Kuomintang-Communist problem could not have occurred in the Northeast at all. The Communist Party is so harsh on others but lenient on itself. People all over the world are not all to be deceived.</p>
<p>Finally, I urge the left-leaning intellectuals to pay attention. You attack the U.S. military for arming the government forces, but how do you force the government to recognize the bandits armed by the Soviet army in the Northeast? You attack the government for not having sincerity in the negotiations, but why do you let the Communist troops run rampant in the Northeast and launch wars in various parts of Shandong? Your one-sided judgments only fuel the arrogance of the Communist Party and do nothing to help the country or the people!</p>
<p>What time is this? What world is this? I ask the intellectuals to bring out their conscience, recognize the facts, and stop cheering for ambitious people! Wei Boqiao, June 20th.</p>
<h3>From Liaoyang to Siping: A Seven-Day Dispatch from Siping</h3>
<p>— Guan Rongqin</p>
<p>A Seven-Day Dispatch from Siping</p>
<p>After a hurried farewell to a few friends, I, the reporter, boarded a carriage and rushed to the train station to catch the 2:00 PM train. I had stayed in Liaoyang for over forty days. Had I known I would be there so long, I would have become restless. Yet, as the time to leave approached, I felt a bit reluctant. To be honest, I disliked the obstacles and fortifications at every five steps and every ten steps in Liaoyang. However, I liked many things beyond those obstacles and fortifications. It is true that Liaoyang produced several "notorious" traitors, such as Yu Chonghan and Yuan Jinkai. The mansions built with the blood and sweat of the Northeastern compatriots—the Yu and Yuan families—still stand majestically in this ancient mountain city, dimming some of its luster, but not erasing its innate beauty.</p>
<p>Everywhere Green, Yet Fields Cannot Be Planted</p>
<p>The Tang Pagoda, standing healthily at the West Station, has endured so much wind, rain, ice, and snow! Century after century, it still appears so "vigorous in old age"! And then there's the Temple of Confucius, also covered with the wrinkles of history: the courtyard around the tablets of Confucius and the "Seventy-Two Sages," is covered with lush greenery. Perhaps because it stands quietly in the eastern corner of the city, there are fewer visitors. Stepping into the temple gate, unless you are wearing squeaky leather shoes, you can even hear the buzzing of flies and mosquitoes. Its serenity contrasts sharply with the rumbling of vehicles and the dust-filled streets. Furthermore, there's the Temple of Guan Yu and the Kui Xing Tower, also standing in the eastern part of the city. Their surroundings are indeed filled with fortifications, barbed wire, and electric fences, symbolizing unease. However, you will not forget that Liaoyang is indeed the earliest established county-level city in Liaoning Province, even preceding Shenyang in its historical longevity.</p>
<p>Traveling north from Liaoyang (only as far as Sipingjie), is like traveling south from Liaoyang: along the railway line, everywhere you look is lush greenery, swaying in the wind. Recalling the scene from two months ago, will make you feel like you have drifted into another world. To prevent bandits from sabotaging transportation, the authorities issued an order long ago: no crops are allowed to be planted within five li on either side of the railway. Five jia on one side, adding up to ten li on both sides. I hope those in charge of the railway can calculate how much land in the Northeast cannot be planted with crops. In a country plagued by famine, where people and animals are eating each other, there is actually a phenomenon of having fields but not being allowed to plant them. Only a fool would not find this strange!</p>
<p>Several Large Stations, Tracks Like a Spider's Web</p>
<p>From Liaoyang to Siping, you have to pass through several large stations: namely, Sujiatun, Shenyang, Tieling, and Kaiyuan. Sujiatun is not a large place, but Sujiatun Railway Station is the first in our country and the third in the world, its size is imaginable. Whether it is actually that large remains to be verified. I only know that when the train arrives at the station, looking out from the train window, you see densely packed tracks, arranged in parallel, exhausting your eyes and mind, yet you cannot see the end. Shenyang is naturally also a large station, but the parallel tracks are not as numerous as those in Sujiatun. Tieling is also considered a large station. From Liaoyang to Shenyang is 180 li, and from Shenyang to Tieling is 120 li. It is said that Tieling used to be an industrial area. However, the impression that this "former industrial area" county town gave to the reporter was only of some empty and desolate buildings in the suburbs. They look majestic from the outside, but looking in through the dark and scorched windows, you would never imagine that they were originally factories. If someone had not told me in advance, I would have suspected that those houses were haunted houses, burnt down by people afraid of ghosts. Inside Tieling city, the streets are still neat, with green trees standing regularly on both sides. Stalls selling used goods from Japanese residents occupy two or three streets, where the crowds surge like ocean waves, constantly squeezing back and forth.</p>
<p>Kaiyuan Divided into Two Cities, Eighteen Li Apart</p>
<p>From Tieling to Kaiyuan is only 60 li, and the train arrives in an hour. Kaiyuan is divided into two cities, new and old, separated by eighteen li. The new city is much better than the old city, which is of course because the Japanese residential area is in the new city. New Kaiyuan was the foothold for the National Army when they attacked Siping and Xifeng. Although the National Army has advanced far away, they have left behind many rear supply stations. What make these "stations" look imposing are the fortresses and barbed wire. The streets of the new city of Kaiyuan are neat, but because recovery is not easy, some places are still in disarray. For example, the land registration books here were taken away by the retreating Eighth Route Army, resulting in many unclear property disputes, which often have to be resolved by the county magistrate or the head of the finance department. The Japanese residents who stayed behind are gradually returning to their home country or gathering in one place. The vacated and clean houses are either occupied by the current railway employees, or have their doors and windows nailed shut with wooden boards, with slips of paper on the boards saying "Residence of Officer ××" or "Residence of Squad Leader ××". Those Japanese residents who have not left continue to sell the belongings they cannot take away. There are many cheap things, but once they pass through the hands of speculators, the price increases several times. Books are still cheap, five yuan a jin, with few buyers. Some Japanese do not want their books to fall into the hands of our compatriots, so they set them on fire. Some students patrol in groups, specifically searching for books to be thrown into the fire, to enrich their school libraries.</p>
<p>The Flames of War Have Ceased, But Landmines Still Explode</p>
<p>The Shenyang-Dalian passenger train opened on June 1st. The reporter took a military train from Kaiyuan to Siping on May 28th.</p>
<p>Like other cities in the Northeast, Siping is divided into two areas: one is the Japanese residential area, and the other is the "Manchu" area. The architecture and hygiene are very different in the two areas. Standing on the high and long "Bridge," you can see the Japanese residential area to the west and the "Manchu" area to the east. The former is called "Daoxi," and the latter is called "Daodong." Daodong has tall buildings, the streets are neat, wide, and flat, and there are tall green trees along the streets. Although it is now in a state of "disturbance," the place is still clean. Daoxi has few tall buildings, and although the streets are still neat, it is difficult to find even cobblestone roads. The ditches are not cleared, there is filth everywhere, there are no trees, and brothels are everywhere. The flames of war have ceased for over half a month, but the landmines buried by the Communist army are still "booming" day and night. During the fighting, it is said that hundreds of innocent civilians died. Walking on the streets and in the suburbs, you can still smell the stench of corpses and hear cries of grief. The train station, burnt down to only a black skeleton, and the buildings in the suburbs, riddled with holes, are especially unforgettable.</p>
<p>Visiting Important Figures in the Provincial Government, Talking About the Current Situation of Recovery</p>
<p>In order to understand the current situation of recovery in the local area, the reporter visited the local authorities: first, I visited Chairman Liu of the provincial government. Unfortunately, he was away on official business, so I had to present my card and request to see Director Zhang Shilun of the Civil Affairs Department. Director Zhang, who is busy with many affairs, gave me an unusually deep impression when he received the reporter with such leisure. Director Zhang said that the provincial government moved back to Siping on May 18th and immediately started working. Originally, the provincial government had completed the takeover on January 8th of this year, but after the Soviet army withdrew, the Communist army immediately came to seize it. The security team under the command of the provincial government, despite its weak strength and inferior weapons, rose up to resist, fighting from March 12th to March 17th, and finally retreated due to the disparity in strength. It is estimated that 700 people were killed, and nearly 1,000 were injured. Most of the personnel under Chairman Liu of the provincial government were captured. Although this was a defeat, it was the first time that the provincial government's own forces had resisted the Communist army alone in the Northeast after the recovery. Speaking of why the Communist army wanted to seize Siping and defend it to the death, Director Zhang said there were three reasons: first, they saw that the Northeast problem would be resolved through political negotiations by the government, and in order to strengthen their position at the negotiating table, they had to fight to the death in several major places such as Siping and Changchun, to show their strength; second, Siping is a key strategic location in the Northeast, a political and military hub, and by occupying it, they could cut off the connection of the National Army going north, and coordinate with the Communist army in Changchun and its vicinity; third, Siping still had materials left over from the enemy and puppet regimes, which they wanted to plunder. Talking about the problem of internal staff in the provincial government, Director Zhang said that those above the recommended level mostly came from the rear, while those above the commissioned level were mostly recruited locally: this was not because there was a distinction in the use of personnel, but because local personnel (many of whom were university students) had little experience in more important work during the puppet Manchukuo era. When talking about the takeover and security situation in various counties, Director Zhang said that all counties in Liaobei had been taken over, except for Tongliao County, where the county government was temporarily located in Liaoning Province due to poor security. The security of each county is generally not a major issue. Finally, when talking about the takeover issue, Director Zhang said that the so-called takeover was nothing more than a few houses that were half-broken and half-intact, and there were very few materials.</p>
<p>However, according to Mayor Yang's reply: "We have to do it anyway; even if we do it slowly, it is better than standing still. We have to create the environment"!</p>
<h3>Social Services: Responding to Readers</h3>
<p>Medical and Health</p>
<p>(1) Shen Ruijun asks: I have been suffering from a type of neck ringworm for years, and the pain is unbearable. I have used various ringworm medications on the market, but not only have they not been effective, but they have gradually spread, occupying half of my neck. I sincerely ask if you have any special medicine or a dermatologist to recommend, I would be very grateful.</p>
<p>[Reply from Medical Doctor Tang Renjin] There is no specific medicine, but X-rays can be used for treatment. You may want to consult Dr. You Pengxi, whose address can be found in the telephone directory.</p>
<p>(2) Fei Cun asks: My younger sister Chun was born only six months into the pregnancy, commonly known as a "June baby." She is now seventeen years old, but has not yet developed, and is like a girl of thirteen or fourteen years old. I would like to ask a few questions: (1) Is it due to congenital deficiency that she has not yet developed? (2) What is the normal age for development? (3) Will it affect her future fertility and the children she may have?</p>
<p>[Reply from Medical Doctor Tang Renxu] (1) It is indeed due to congenital deficiency. (2) Whether she will develop in the future depends on the circumstances. You can consult a pediatrician for diagnosis and treatment. (3) If she is underdeveloped, it will naturally affect her fertility. (3) Pingping Jun asks: Editor, I am a young student. When I was a child, I accidentally injured my ankle, and soon my legs became red and swollen, my joints twitched, and the pain was unbearable. Western and Chinese doctors diagnosed me with bone tuberculosis (also known as bone fistula in Chinese medicine). They told me to rest and prescribed injections and medicine, but there was no improvement. Unexpectedly, after a while, the leg suddenly festered, and the condition became more dangerous. Many doctors were helpless, and medicine was ineffective. Finally, it became a stubborn and incurable chronic bone tuberculosis. Later, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and the environment was harsh, so I could not continue treatment. During that time, the condition was sometimes severe and sometimes mild. Now I specially write to ask for medical advice, so that I can get rid of my long-term illness at once, then I would be very grateful.</p>
<p>[Reply from Medical Doctor Tang Ren] This is bone tuberculosis. You should consult a bone specialist for diagnosis and treatment. The future depends on the progression of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<h3>Service Briefs</h3>
<p>Looking for a Missing Orphan Girl I am a maid. My husband died early, and I have a daughter who is now fourteen years old. Because I have no one to take care of her, I entrusted someone this month to recommend her to work as a maid in a mansion near Xin'yamen on North Zhejiang Road. Unexpectedly, she suddenly went missing on the sixth of this month. Whether she ran away or was abducted is unknown. The girl's name is Ayou. She is short, has short hair, wears casual clothes and sneakers, and is from Taoyaojia'ao, Liangnong, Yuyao. She speaks with a Shaoxing accent. I only have this one daughter, and I am extremely saddened. Because I cannot afford to publish an advertisement, I specially ask to borrow a corner of your newspaper to disclose it. If there are any benevolent people who know her whereabouts, please notify No. 38, Lane 504, Tongfu Road, Zhongzheng Middle Road, so that mother and daughter can be reunited. I would be very grateful. Xu Chenshi respectfully.</p>

<h3>On the Grain Loan Case</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>The grain loan case is still under investigation, and the time has been delayed for a long time. Although the common people are very anxious and hope that the truth will come out soon, they can still be patient because they think that the judicial process must be investigated clearly and the evidence must be solid before a verdict can be reached.</p>
<p>However, it would be wrong to think that the matter can be dragged out until a major event becomes a minor event, and a minor event becomes nothing. To be honest, if this grain loan case cannot be handled clearly, the consequences will be unpredictable.</p>
<p>Now there are many people on the streets who are whispering and shouting loudly. They say: During the dark and corrupt period of the puppet regime, a major case was handled, which was very satisfying. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, under the National Government's consistent policy of eradicating corruption, I believe it will never be dealt with ambiguously.</p>
<p>What is puzzling and worrying is that two agencies are vying to handle this case. We do not necessarily insist on which agency should handle it, whether it is the court or the Garrison Headquarters, but there is one principle that we insist on, and that is that it must be open and fair!</p>
<p>Yesterday, two grain officials, Wang and Ren, were escorted to the Garrison Headquarters. It is said that during the interrogation, the confessions of some grain merchants and Wang Daren involved various points of the Ministry of Food and Minister Xu Kan. The Military Law Department has sent a letter to the Ministry of Food to investigate the truth, but has not yet received a reply.</p>
<p>We suggest that the Garrison Headquarters immediately summon Xu Kan and relevant personnel of the Ministry of Food. We know that Yu Hongjun, the Minister of Finance, was summoned to the court to testify in the gold fraud case in Chongqing last year, so we believe that Minister Xu will definitely step forward to complete the investigation of this case as soon as possible. Otherwise, what will people think?</p>
<h3>About the Longhua Society</h3>
<p>— Yang Hongnian</p>
<p>Emperor Ma's Departure Is Not a Fact</p>
<p>It is surprising that a so-called "One Heart Great Way Longhua Holy Sect General Assembly" can exist as usual in a city like Tianjin after the recovery. Although the dispatch from Tianjin on the 17th of this newspaper described it in great detail, it focused more on the wartime and the past situation after the recovery, and less on the present. Therefore, I would like to make what I know public to respond to readers.</p>
<p>Before the war, Tianjin was a so-called special area, especially the Japanese concession, which made full use of the opportunity to create this "special" center. Japanese ronin and secret service agencies were always using these ambitious wolfish men to play various roles to do things that anesthetized the people. But speaking of it, the origin of this "Longhua Society" dates back to Changshan Island in Shandong. The so-called "Emperor Ma" was a wealthy man on the island. I don't know who instigated him, but he actually started to create dreams in this small village. At first, he did sell his family property to do some good deeds for the public. At the same time, the people of Shandong were complaining about Han Fuqu's "cleaning the countryside" because Han Fuqu used a "using poison to fight poison" policy, using ordinary bandits as leaders of the suppression, so there were bound to be some cases of foxes pretending to be tigers. "Emperor Ma" also took this opportunity to bring in a large number of believers into his religion. These believers must first donate all their family property to the religion so that the property can be equally distributed. The consistent treatment made those who were loyal to him gradually increase. Slowly, his ambitions expanded, from village to town, from town to county, so that he effortlessly occupied the entire Changshan. At this time, Japanese secret service agents provided a large amount of military supplies and sent people to assist and command, so that the prestige of "Emperor Ma" in Shandong even exceeded that of Han Fuqu. If anyone still remembers Han Fuqu's "doors not closed at night" policy in Shandong, he cannot be said to have made no contribution to the suppression of "local emperors." But the second half of this contribution was left to the Japanese. Like using Puyi, the Japanese saw that "Emperor Ma" could not gain a foothold in Shandong, so they specially sent a transport ship to take him to Dalian, and then to the Japanese concession in Tianjin. It was around the 18th year of the Republic of China that the yellow flag of the "One Heart Great Way Longhua Holy Church" was hung up at the corner of Taoshan Street and Suma Street. Another flag was inscribed with the words "Living Spirit Mountain," which was quite difficult to understand. One character of the former flag was written as 一, and there was also a flag called "True Lord" and heretical theories such as changing the monthly calendar. At this time, his followers were mostly over forty years old (there were also a few people in their teens), wearing blue cloth robes, left lapel, cloth shoes, cloth socks, and braids, all the same. They were rarely heard chanting scriptures, and in the evening, they often stood outside the door, flirting with prostitutes across the street, and there were quite a few people doing so.</p>
<p>In the 26th year of the Republic of China, the National Army retreated south and Tianjin fell. The head of the Society led his followers in a parade in the streets, and he himself sat steadily in a "Buick" car. He made noises similar to shouting, but it was not clear what language he was speaking, which made people suspect that he was not human. Later, the Society occupied the Grand Stage in the South Market, and also used to open porridge factories and write donations everywhere. All major stores and gentry were assigned a donation amount, which was actually using power rather than a charitable act. Tao Yunxiang's statement in the newspaper that "Emperor Ma left in the 24th year" may not be true or is intentionally covering up. His boasting about running charitable undertakings to cover up underground workers is also full of lies. If the Society could also cover up underground workers, the Japanese secret service agencies might have been more convenient! In short, this is not some heretical religion, but an organization with full political functions. I hope the authorities pay attention. At the same time, I also hope that the citizens of Tianjin will report on everything in the past. More reports will enable the authorities to deal with it better, so I will record what I have heard.</p>
<h3>On "Little Red"</h3>
<p>— Cao Zuohan</p>
<p>There was a textual researcher who specialized in creating indexes who said: "The Little Red in *Dream of the Red Chamber* is a veiled reference to Hong Chengchou, the Ming dynasty traitor and Qing dynasty meritorious dog, a senior official who served two dynasties." I am not a follower of Hu Gu, so I am not in a position to comment on this statement. However, such a comparison is somewhat unfair to Little Red, and I also feel it is somewhat unfair to Hong Chengchou.</p>
<p>"People aspire to climb to high places, water flows to low places" is a common sentiment in the world. Consider Little Red's situation in the Garden of Joy and Delight. She only did peripheral work, handling rough tasks outside the main rooms. Bao Erye's personal matters were handled by Xiren, Qingwen, Sheyue, Qiuwen, and others. Other old women and senior maids surrounded the inner circle tightly. Without the opportunity to enter the inner rooms and be close to the master, she naturally could not gain the master's trust and love. If a servant cannot gain the master's trust and love, how can they become popular among the servants and outshine others? Moreover, Little Red was someone who liked to primp and preen, thinking highly of herself. How could she be content with an obscure and insignificant existence?</p>
<p>In order not to waste her talent, she waited for an opportunity to showcase herself, hoping to get a chance to "pop her head up". It is like a graduate or master's degree holder who just received their diploma, always hoping to open the door to society and put on airs, which is understandable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Little Red's fate was ill-timed, and opportunities were rare. She barely managed to enter the inner circle once when there was a gap, offering some flattery to Bao Erye, but was quickly squeezed out by Bao Erye's trusted servants. Qingwen even poured cold water on her with satire and scolding, and she was sent back to the periphery.</p>
<p>How could someone with high aspirations endure this? Therefore, upon gaining the favor of Sister Feng, she immediately climbed to a higher branch, eager to serve like a dog or horse. Switching to a master with real power can be considered as achieving her initial goals, although her personal desires were still unmet.</p>
<p>Hong Chengchou's situation, however, was different. He was originally a minister of state in the Ming dynasty, and the emperor trusted him exceptionally. People generally regarded him as a pillar of the state. If he had wanted to devote himself wholeheartedly, there would have been limitless opportunities to develop his talents, and the emperor would not have suppressed his abilities. However, he turned against the emperor and surrendered to the enemy, becoming a traitor to the emperor and a national traitor, handing over the beautiful Ming dynasty territories to foreign invaders.</p>
<p>Therefore, compared to the two, Hong Chengchou can be said to be a villain among gentlemen. A true villain is more likeable than a hypocrite, so Little Red seems a bit more discerning than Hong Chengchou.</p>
<p>If Little Red is not like Hong Chengchou, then who is she like?</p>
<p>Ignoring the criticism of "aping others," I say: She is very much like the frustrated politicians and outdated warlords since the beginning of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Consider the history of internal strife in China since the founding of the Republic of China until the completion of the Northern Expedition. What real meaning did each battle have? Was it worth fighting to the death? Yet, they constantly fought and killed each other. It was just a few ambitious people who thought highly of themselves and were unwilling to be ignored, seeking only to express themselves.</p>
<p>Up today, down tomorrow; allied with A today, turning against B tomorrow; following whoever has the milk; if you don't want me here, there's always another place for me. All sorts of things were stirred up, causing chaos and confusion. It was just a few servants who were unwilling to accept their fate, stirring up trouble. Only they can understand this muddled mess.</p>
<p>However, Little Red seems a bit stronger than them, which is why the shrewd and capable Sister Feng appreciated her. When Li Wan was confused by a "Grandma and Madam" account, she was able to explain it clearly and logically. It's understandable that she was unwilling to be overlooked.</p>
<p>What about those who lack talent but are unwilling to be overlooked? The result is harming others and ruining themselves. The politicians and warlords since the founding of the Republic of China are an example. Therefore, I am deeply worried about those who have Little Red's ambitions but lack Little Red's talent.</p>
<h3>Theatergoers on the Third Floor</h3>
<p>— Chu Lanfu</p>
<p>On the first day of the famous amateur and professional opera actors' performance, acting on impulse, I rushed to the entrance of the Tianchan Theater at 4:30 in the afternoon. Unexpectedly, the iron gate was already closed, and people were crowding outside the iron gate guarded by armed police, filling the entire street. The most impatient people were at the front, grabbing the iron railing, unwilling to let go. They opened their mouths wide, staring inside, like prisoners who had been locked up for a long time, longing for freedom through the iron bars—these people were like me, theatergoers on the third floor, with only two thousand yuan of purchasing power.</p>
<p>I sighed and lamented at the gate, planning to go back. I regretted being a little late, but also congratulated myself on my two thousand yuan in an self-consoling way. Just as I was hesitating, I ran into a friend who had watched performances at this theater through the back door. He looked at my dejected face and said, "Don't go, I'll take you up there in a while!" Coincidentally, the iron gate opened a crack, so my friend pulled me in, taking advantage of the crowd surging in. We didn't take the regular route, because the regular route was strictly guarded. The ticket check was heavily guarded, and anyone without a ticket was driven out. We were considered to have taken the private route.</p>
<p>I don't know how we got there, but I followed my friend to the third-floor seating area. It was unbelievable! More than half of the entire floor was already crowded, and people were still pouring in through the entrance. I hurriedly found a seat in the fifth row. Looking at the clock, it was only five o'clock, and on the cold stage stood a sign that was both polite and sarcastic—"Performance starts at 8:00 PM!" Looking down, the main hall and the second floor were all neatly empty, with rows of seats, and not a single person.</p>
<p>But our place had become a lively sea. The hostesses were busy making tea, shouting "Thank you..." while squeezing around. The snack vendors wore mournful faces, carrying their trays of goods, because they were squeezed so tightly that they couldn't move. People were desperately saving seats, arguing with those who came later and tried to take them. Three or four people were fighting over a telescope, looking at the empty stage... The air was filled with smoke, and various noisy sounds mixed together into a mess. I congratulated myself on getting a seat and chatted with a middle-aged man in the front row. "You're late, I came at 1:30!" he said to me in Shanghai dialect, seemingly very satisfied with his seat.</p>
<p>"What great perseverance!" I couldn't help but exclaim. In fact, my perseverance was no small feat either. I endured the three hours from five o'clock to eight o'clock in this lively but lonely sea, not knowing how I passed the time. All the third-floor theatergoers—their perseverance is not small.</p>
<p>The pre-performance drumbeats also aroused cheers from the crowd, and the opera began with the loveliness of "clouds in a great drought". "Killing the Family by the Fishing" moved me greatly. The scene of the fisherman and his daughter being forced to kill by evil forces was quite profound; there were not many such operas in the old repertoire. After this opera, many special theatergoers appeared on stage. These people were uniformly neat, beautiful, and modern. Their elegant demeanor and leisurely attitude made us feel like we were in different worlds.</p>
<p>The opera was in progress, but I was drawn to these high-class people. A tall gentleman gave me even more amusement, reminding me of a humorous article I read in the newspaper about people's facial features. The author said: "Strange shapes are noble signs, and many nobles or rich people are indeed pig-shaped." This gentleman forcefully proved the author's opinion.</p>
<p>The opera ended quickly, and I squeezed out of the theater with the crowd. Hundreds of cars were parked along several streets, waiting to pick up their owners. Dragging my tired body through the gaps between the vehicles, I wondered when there would be a reasonable place to appreciate art.</p>
<h3>Comic Strip: The Adventures of Sanmao as a Soldier (46)</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Leping</p>
<p>News Tidbits</p>
<h3>Ruined by Women</h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>Regarding the criminal psychology of Chen Yuansheng, the main culprit in the gold brick case, it is nothing more than a dissolute life and greed for money. He was initially infatuated with women and ultimately ruined by them. The four vices of wine, sex, wealth, and temper harmed his life. At the moment of his arrest, he was still drinking alone, not expecting that "drinking to drown sorrow only makes sorrow more sorrowful," and disaster had arrived.</p>
<p>Considering Chen's age, he was at the prime of his life. Unfortunately, he didn't know how to use his "unlimited gold" but focused on taking shortcuts and making a fortune. As a result, he stole "limited gold" from the national treasury, ultimately ending up in prison. If Chen had thought of the old saying, "A single slip can cause everlasting regret, and a hundred years won't bring back the past," he would have been overwhelmed with emotion. In this way, Chen's mental organization seems simple, just as the saying goes, "Trying to be clever but being outsmarted by cleverness!"</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the crime, Chen spent his days seeking pleasure with women in Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Jiaxing, acting like a wealthy young master and putting on an air of indifference. Just as the saying goes, "It's not sex that confuses people, but people who confuse themselves." Unexpectedly, he still hadn't awakened from his illusions even in front of Lingyin Temple, a sacred Buddhist site. When the gold bars in his bag fell into the ditch, he advised people to value their lives and not to go down to retrieve them. If Buddha had a spirit, he would also say, "Emptiness is form, form is emptiness," Amitabha!</p>
<p>After only a month of seeking pleasure, he ended up tasting the flavor of iron bars and enduring the foul air of prison. Thinking about it for Chen, the price he paid was too high. Wine, sex, wealth, and temper should be handled with caution!</p>
<p>According to Shenyang reports: "Eight or nine out of ten people in Shenyang buy newspapers not to read them, but to judge them by the quality and quantity of the paper, regardless of the content." In fact, isn't that also the case for people in Shanghai? I wonder if the millions of copies sold of *The New York Times* and the *New York Daily News* in the United States are also related to the large format of the newspapers?</p>
<p>General Feng Yuxiang recently traveled from Chongqing to Nanjing, choosing to take a boat instead of a plane. After arriving in Nanjing, he didn't talk about politics but focused on *The Classic of Waterways*, seemingly developing a great interest in water. This was probably inspired by being appointed to go abroad to study water conservancy. It is said that Feng once said: "China's problem is just a water conservancy problem. President Chiang will manage the Yellow River, and I will manage the Yangtze River. If these two places are managed well, China will also be managed well."</p>
<h3>Seal Talk: Cutting with the Knife</h3>
<p>— Gao Tianxin</p>
<p>There are methods for cutting with the knife: single knife, double knife, flat knife, vertical knife, cutting knife, straight knife, burying knife, filing knife, dancing knife, flying knife, and patching knife. But according to me, there is only the distinction between single knife and double knife. There is no need to fully believe in other methods, but it is necessary to know them all. Because the completion of a seal involves various methods. If you only rely on one knife method, it is difficult to carve a good seal. Only when holding the knife should you think as if you were holding a pen. The real method is to avoid unnecessary embellishment. It is like writing calligraphy, do not add too much and avoid unnecessary embellishment, then the vitality will be full and not stiff. Also, it must be done in one breath, with full spirit, looking at the seal surface, making it for our use, allowing us to exert ourselves, not being subjugated by the seal surface.</p>

<p>In the western United States, the average height of young women is five feet three and one-quarter inches, and the weight is one hundred and twenty-seven pounds; the average height of men is five feet eight and three-quarters inches, and the weight is one hundred and fifty-three and a half pounds.</p>
<p>These are the latest measurement results obtained by Dr. McGowan, an anthropology expert at the University of California. The purpose of McGowan's survey is to obtain the average length of men's and women's arms and legs for reference in improving artificial arms.</p>
<p>Among the one thousand men who participated in the survey, there were many female college students; the one thousand eight hundred men covered a wide range, from seventeen to ninety years old.</p>
<p>The average length of young women's arms is as follows: total arm length is twenty and a half inches, upper arm is eleven and three-quarters inches, forearm (excluding hand) is nine inches; leg length is thirty and three-quarters inches; hip circumference is twenty-two and a half inches; ankle is eight and a half inches; elbow is ten inches.</p>

<h3>The Theory That Reading is Useless</h3>
<p>— Alarmist Remarks</p>
<p>Recently, I often hear young students say, "The national crisis is so severe, what's the use of reading?" I also saw a cartoon on the wall of a certain university, depicting several skulls placed on a book. Young people are already reluctant to read books by habit, and now they have theoretical support. Therefore, under the slogan of "patriotism above all else, reading is useless," they formally declare their separation from books and embark on a political journey. This is the phenomenon in China's education sector after the war.</p>
<p>According to the United States Information Service in Washington, the Office of Scientific Research and Development has transferred a large number of scientific documents to the Library of Congress, which will be distributed free of charge to all universities and libraries in the United States. These documents are the result of the Office of Scientific Research and Development's great wartime research project. They include physics, radar, radio equipment, rockets, chemistry, optics, electrical transportation, underwater warfare, etc. These reports will be of great benefit to scientists, educators, and industrialists in various sectors. This can represent a glimpse of the dynamics of the American academic community after the war.</p>
<p>Comparing these two situations, we can see that they hope to build the country through science. In order to lay the foundation for building the country through science, they want to universally study these scientific reports. And in our country, the leaders of young people seem to hope to build the country through politics. In order to lay the foundation for building the country through politics, they are busy directing young students to write slogans and hold demonstrations. We don't necessarily disapprove of students participating in political activities, and we also know that if politics is not on track, all other developments will be hindered. However, we want to ask the leaders of today's youth to pay attention to three things. First, please correct the idea that reading is useless and guide young people to read more books. Because behavior without knowledge is blind. Second, please pay attention to the multifaceted development of young people in terms of knowledge and ability, and do not just mechanically instill political doctrines. We especially want young people to pay more attention to scientific research reports, in order to lay a good foundation for China's industrialization. Third, when you guide young people to read, your purpose is to help them pursue the truth, not to proselytize them.</p>
<p>Finally, I quote a passage from Gorky to dedicate to Chinese youth who love activities:</p>
<p>'Love books, they will make your life easier; they will help you amiably discern the diversity and complex confusion of thoughts, feelings and various events; they will teach you to respect others and yourself; they will put wings on your intellect and mind with love for the world and for humanity.</p>
<p>Let it conflict with your beliefs, if it is written sincerely with love for mankind and the desire for people to live better, then it is a good book!'</p>
<h3>Review of A History of Chinese Political Thought</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zhen</p>
<p>(Volume 1) Written by Xiao Gongquan, Published by the Commercial Press</p>
<p>Anyone who has read Xiao Gongquan's *Political Pluralism* (Hsiao Kung-chuan: Political Pluralism A Strudy in Contimporary Political. Theory. N.H. Harcourt London, 1927) has high expectations for Xiao Gongquan. *Political Pluralism* is an outstanding doctoral dissertation, listed in the International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method, and has been published for nearly twenty years. During these years, he seemed very quiet. Apart from occasionally seeing his articles in the *Tsinghua Journal* and the *English China Monthly*, we rarely had the opportunity to see his works. Recently, Xiao Gongquan published his new book *A History of Chinese Political Thought* by the Commercial Press, which is a very noteworthy and good book. There are already quite a few books about the history of Chinese political thought circulating on the market, but they all have a common problem: they all stand on a narrow point of view, arguing about the class and status of thinkers; the idealism or materialism of doctrines; and copying a sentence from here and excerpting a paragraph from there, almost like a gambler who "calls a *lu* and gets a *lu*, calls a pheasant and gets a pheasant." As for being able to grasp the entire thought system of a thinker and write a comprehensive and thorough "descriptive study," there is only Xiao Gongquan's new *A History of Chinese Political Thought*. In this book, Mr. Xiao "narrates the thoughts of various schools, striving to maintain an objective attitude, and if there are any comments, they are intended to clarify their historical status, and not to arbitrarily praise or denigrate, or make arbitrary judgments of gains and losses."</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into five parts, totaling twenty-five chapters. Part 1: Political Thought of the Feudal Empire - The Creative Period; Part 2: Political Thought of the Autocratic Empire (Part 1) - The Inheritance Period; Part 3: Political Thought of the Autocratic Empire (Part 2) - The Transition Period; Part 4: Political Thought of the Modern Nation (Part 1) - Transition Period (Part 2); Part 5: Political Thought of the Modern Nation (Part 2) - The Maturity Period.</p>
<p>The author's division into these five parts is not accidental, but principled. The author (A) divides the more than two thousand years of Chinese political thought into four major stages according to the general trend of ideological evolution: (1) The Creative Period—from Confucius to the unification of China by Qin, a period of three hundred years, generally known as the Pre-Qin era. (2) The Inheritance Period—from the Qin and Han dynasties to the Song and Yuan dynasties, a period of about 1,600 years. (3) The Transition Period—from the early Ming dynasty to the early Qing dynasty, a period of about 500 years. (4) The Maturity Period—from the establishment of the Three Principles of the People to the present. The author (B) then divides it into the following three periods according to the historical background (political history) of the emergence of ideas: (1) The Thought of the Feudal Empire, including the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, which corresponds to the above-mentioned Creative Period. (2) The Thought of the Autocratic Empire, including the two thousand years from the Qin and Han dynasties to the Ming and Qing dynasties, which corresponds to the Inheritance Period and the first part of the Transition Period. (3) The Thought of the Modern Nation, including the Reform Movement of the late Qing Dynasty and the Xinhai Revolution to the present, which corresponds to the latter part of the Green Transition Period and the "Maturity Period." Combining the two periods of A and B, we get the above five parts. The first volume of this book is dedicated to expounding the political thought of the Pre-Qin era.</p>
<p>The author believes that Chinese political thought has a common characteristic, that is, it takes "the world" as the object. "The meaning of the concept of 'the world' is roughly similar to the world empire in the early Middle Ages in Europe." The ancient Chinese lacked the international concept of coexisting nations and held the view of "political egoism." Another characteristic is the idea of Great Harmony, "ignoring the distinction of races and valuing the similarity of cultures." As a result, for two thousand years, when China was strong, it sang the theory of "using the Xia to transform the barbarians." When foreign races entered as masters, they accommodated to the facts of political submission, as long as the conquerors practiced the Chinese "way of the former kings" and assimilated into us, they would bow to the north and call themselves subjects, and acknowledge the foreign regime without shame or hatred. This proves that the Chinese only have "cultural prejudice" and no "racial prejudice." "To sum up the above points in one sentence: there is a lack of the concept of a modern nation. ... The so-called modern nation at least has the following characteristics: (1) Establishing a national and autonomous regime; (2) Recognizing the coexistence of nations and their mutual relations; (3) Respecting laws and emphasizing systems, and not relying solely on human ethics and morality for governance; ... (4) Expanding the people's right to participate in politics can also be regarded as one of the characteristics of a modern nation. These four qualities were completely lacking in our country during the period of autocratic rule, and even in the period of division of the feudal empire [i.e., the Pre-Qin era], there were only slight traces, which seemed to be right but were not. The brewing and impact of two thousand years of political thought failed to produce the concept of a modern nation." The conclusion is worthy of serious reflection.</p>
<p>The author believes that the reason why political thought in the late Zhou Dynasty was so developed was due to "the rapid changes in social organization and the timely appearance of great thinkers." The late Zhou Dynasty was a transitional period from a feudal empire to an autocratic empire. During this transitional period, "there are only three possible attitudes towards political thought: (1) expressing attachment to the passing old system and trying to maintain or restore it; (2) acknowledging the status quo or intentionally or unintentionally catering to the future new trend and advocating it; (3) feeling disgusted with all new and old systems and emphasizing personal self-sufficiency and self-comfort. ... The Confucian and Mohist schools both belong to the first category, the Legalist scholars belong to the second category, and Lao Zhuang of the Taoist school and all thinkers who "act for myself" and hermits who practice self-cultivation belong to the third category. The main schools of the Pre-Qin period are Confucianism, Mohism, Taoism, and Legalism. In terms of political thought, these four schools can be divided into three major schools: "One is the rule by men, which Confucianism and Mohism belong to"; "The second is the rule by law, with the Legalists as their representative"; "The school of rule by men and the school of rule by law are both positive political thoughts. The one who adopts a negative attitude and opposes the two schools is the school of non-rule represented by Taoism."</p>
<p>Regarding the sequence of the emergence of various schools of thought, the author believes that "today's lack of literary evidence makes this a very difficult matter. However, there are two ways to verify the sequence of the Pre-Qin schools: one is the sequence of origin, and the other is the sequence of establishment." According to this statement, the age of Lao Tzu, which has been the subject of much debate in the history of Chinese thought, can be easily solved. The author said: "In this book, regarding the origin of Taoism and the birth of Lao Dan, we temporarily follow the old saying and assume that he was before Confucius; as for the completion of Lao Tzu's book, we follow the saying of most scholars and assume that it was after Mencius."</p>
<p>The author believes that Confucius' achievement was "to establish a scholarship for gentlemen to advance and apply based on old stories, and to teach this scholarship to the common people, and to cultivate a new ruling class based on knowledge and virtue." "The starting point of Confucius' political thought is following the Zhou, and the specific proposition for its implementation is 'correcting the ruler', which in today's language means adjusting the rights and obligations of the ruler and his subjects in accordance with the system of the flourishing Zhou Dynasty." "What Confucius called benevolence is to extend the heart of loving oneself to loving others:" Confucius' words on benevolence actually integrate morality, human relations, and politics into one furnace, and bring together the individual, the family, and the country into a coherent whole." "Confucius' methods of governance are three: nurturing, strengthening, and governing." "The tools for nurturing and educating are 'virtue' and 'rites', and the tools for governing are 'administration' and 'punishment'. "Virtue and rites are the main tools, and administration and punishment are the auxiliary tools." Confucius believed that the purpose of the state was not only to support the people, but also to educate the people, to transform the people into customs. The methods of transforming the people into customs are (1) "setting an example" and (2) "teaching people with the Tao." The author believes that "Confucius' idea of 'administration' is not only different from what modern scholars discuss, but also different from the theory of Plato in ancient Greece. Modern discussions of the function of politics are nothing more than two aspects: governing people and governing affairs. Confucius holds the view that 'administration is righteousness' and believes that the main task of politics is to transform people, not to govern people, let alone govern affairs. Therefore, politics and education have the same function, and rulers and teachers share the same job. ... Plato also regards morality as the highest state of the country, and his ideal of a 'philosopher king' is also close to Confucius' proposition of integrating politics and education, and combining the ruler and the teacher. However, Plato's philosopher king is an intellectual philosopher who values ​​wisdom, and Confucius' ruler and teacher is a benevolent person who values ​​virtue. The ruler and the teacher transform people with virtue, and the philosopher king governs the country with wisdom. Their personalities and skills are different." The author believes that the characteristic of Confucian political thought is "taking education as politics" and "taking the development of individual morality as the highest ideal of politics." Therefore, although its methods of governance use both rites and punishments, it still focuses on rites.</p>
<p>The author also has many profound, subtle, and unique insights when discussing the political thoughts of Mencius, Xunzi, Mozi, Laozi, Zhuangzi, Guanzi, Shang Yang, and Han Fei. Due to space limitations, we cannot introduce them to readers one by one, but from the above-mentioned many judgments about Confucius, we can get a glimpse of them. In our opinion, this book has the following advantages: (A) The argument is plain and rigorous—the wording of this book is extremely calm, without excessive words or exaggerated arguments. Anyone who wants to seek intellectual excitement in this book will inevitably find it unremarkable and disappointed. (B) The analysis of the meaning is subtle—the author is extremely detailed in distinguishing between various doctrines that seem similar but are actually different. For example, the legalist thought of the Pre-Qin period and the rule of law thought of modern Europe seem to be almost the same at first glance, but they are actually different. The author said well: "The true essence of the rule of law thought in Europe lies in regarding the law as the highest authority in the political organization. ... Therefore, the law is higher than the power of the monarch, and the monarch is bound by the law. ... It is as contrary to our country's Pre-Qin 'rule of law' thought, which takes the monarch as the subject and the law as the tool, as the two poles." Another example is that the Taoist and Legalist schools also seem similar at first glance, but they are actually very different. "The main points of Huang-Lao's theory of governance are nothing more than purity and inaction, and the Legalist scholars also sometimes express its meaning. ... Guanzi said, 'The void and formless is called the Tao', 'When the name is correct and the law is complete, the sage has nothing to do'. All these words, if placed in the Tao Te Ching, may not feel dissimilar." However, the author believes that the differences between Taoism and Legalism are at least three: (1) The techniques of inaction are different. The Legalists' way to inaction "is to achieve the state of 'the wise monarch is inactive above, and the ministers are in awe below' through the methods of clarifying laws and orders, emphasizing punishment and unifying education. Its technique is exactly the third-rate politics that Lao Tzu said, 'The next fear it'. ... Lao Tzu uses laissez-faire to achieve inaction, and Shen Buhai and Han Fei use autocracy to achieve inaction." (2) The purposes of inaction are different. "The purpose of Huang-Lao's inaction is to establish a pure and quiet rule to protect the people's well-being; the Legalist scholars teach the monarch to practice the methods of inaction to consolidate the monarch's power and establish a strong foundation." (3) The status of the monarch is different. Lao Tzu's "laissez-faire and tolerance are so extreme that the monarch is equivalent to a mere figurehead, and his power cannot be exerted. The monarch in the thoughts of Shen Buhai and Han Fei is the autocratic fire monarch before the unification of Qin Shi Huang, concentrating power in one person and exercising rewards and punishments on all people. ... Therefore, (what the Legalists call) inaction is 'another name for hiding punishment and concealing wisdom, and cannot be mentioned in the same breath as those who are sincere and honest and confuse their minds with the world'." (C) There are many "footnotes"—the depth of the author's efforts in this book can be seen from the many footnotes in each chapter. Each chapter has more than a hundred footnotes. The chapter on Shang Yang and Han Fei has as many as one hundred and forty-two footnotes. These footnotes either indicate the source of "quoted sentences" or supplement and elaborate on what is not detailed in the book, which is uncommon in academic works published in China. This book has many other advantages, but the author humbly said: "The author's knowledge is barren, and this book was drafted during the Anti-Japanese War, so it was inconvenient to refer to books." In fact, this is really a harvest of the domestic academic community during the Anti-Japanese War. We hope to see the remaining volumes of this book soon.</p>

<h3>"A Study of Currency and Prices"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhensheng</p>
<p>Written by Jiang Tingfu, sold by the author's bookstore</p>
<p>It has been ten months since the victory, but the suffering of the people is still the same. Prices in various places continue to rise, resulting in strikes and go-slows. In addition, foreign goods are pouring in, and all production factories are in a very dangerous situation. The reasons for all of this are not limited to one aspect, but in addition to the political situation, it is the issue of currency and prices. Therefore, there has been a lot of discussion about currency and prices recently, but most of them are limited to temporary and local works, or about foreign exchange, or about price indexes, or describing the price situation in one place, etc. There is no work on the entire issue of currency and prices. Mr. Jiang's work on this book is indeed very suitable for the current needs.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into eight chapters, namely (1) Introduction to Currency, (2) Introduction to Prices (5) Credit and Currency, (4) Value of Currency, (5) Causes of Price Fluctuations, (6) Quantity Theory of Money, (7) Effects of Price Fluctuations and Price Policy, (8) Overview of Price Fluctuations in Modern China. In the first two chapters, currency and prices are analyzed and explained in detail, so that those who study currency and prices can first clearly understand the problem. Then, in chapters three and four, we study the evolution of currency and the various relationships that arise with the price problem. In chapters five and six, we study the causes of price fluctuations, elaborate on various theories in detail, and then establish a new theory with reference to facts, namely the quantity theory of trade created by Mr. Jiang in this book. In chapter seven, the advantages and disadvantages of price fluctuations and the types of price policies to be applied are analyzed and explained in detail. In the last chapter, chapter eight, the price fluctuations in China over the years are described in detail as evidence. The whole book is consistent from beginning to end, with clear levels, and both theory and facts are studied, making it an excellent introductory book for those who have never studied currency and prices.</p>
<p>The most prominent theory of currency and prices in various countries to date is the quantity theory of money. Although this theory has various shortcomings, there is still no more accurate knowledge that can overthrow and replace this theory. Now Mr. Jiang overthrows this theory in this book and creates the quantity theory of trade to replace it. Mr. Jiang said: "Goods existed long before currency was invented, but in the past, goods were not exchanged through currency, so there was no price problem. In the future, with the progress of world science, modern currency may be completely abolished in the future and replaced by other methods. If that time comes, prices will naturally no longer be a problem. But the need for goods is indispensable to human life. No matter how advanced science is, the need for goods will only increase its types and become more complicated. It is impossible to break the need for goods and maintain life. Therefore, the importance of the price problem lies in the goods, not in money or currency. ... Currency is just a means to serve as a medium of exchange." He also said: "Currency has undergone many changes. Recently, coins have been eliminated, and most transactions are exchanged between credit currency and goods. ... Therefore, in the modern price problem, currency has gradually lost its importance, and the important factor in the price problem, in addition to goods, is transaction. No matter what form of transaction is used, if there is no transaction, there will be no price problem. Although various transactions do not all use currency for exchange, the quantity of currency is still used as the standard for exchange calculation. Therefore, the basic elements of the price problem, in addition to goods, are the quantity of trade." This theory does have a unique view. Mr. Jiang also believes that the velocity of money can only be applied to the coin era, and in the credit currency era, the velocity of goods circulation is often used to replace it. This statement is also quite accurate. Moreover, Mr. Jiang has also arranged the formula for the quantity of trade according to theory and facts as:</p>
<p>QPC=E</p>
<p>Therefore, in this book, Mr. Jiang not only introduces many theories of currency and prices, but also develops what the predecessors have not developed, and overthrows the remainder quantity theory of the British school of Keynes and the transaction quantity theory of the American school of Fisher, and establishes a new theory to replace them. Therefore, this book is indeed an excellent book for adding research materials for those who have already studied the issue of currency and prices.</p>
<p>This book is detailed in describing facts and clear in analysis. In the first chapter, regarding the evolution of currency, the situation in China and other countries is stated concisely and in detail. In the second chapter, regarding the meaning, function, and calculation methods of the price index, each is explained in detail, making it quite detailed, so that readers can understand the function and algorithm of the index. In the sixth chapter, regarding the origin of the quantity theory of money and the various theories of currency by scholars from various countries over the years, they are explained in detail. By reading this, you can understand the evolution of currency theory in various countries around the world. In the eighth chapter, regarding the price fluctuations in our country since the Republic of China and their causes, they are divided into two periods, the first period from the first year of the Republic of China to the twenty-fourth year, and the second period from the twenty-fifth year to the present. Each period is described in detail, and various index tables of great value are attached. Therefore, this book is also an invaluable reference book for those who study currency and price issues in general.</p>
<h3>"Frosty Leaves Red Like February Flowers" - A Review</h3>
<p>— Yao Xun</p>
<p>Mr. Mao Dun's monumental work, "Frosty Leaves Red Like February Flowers," totaling over 1.5 million words, has had its first volume, approximately 150,000 words, published by Hua Hua Bookstore. It is set against the backdrop of the Republic of China's tenth year – the May Fourth era – and offers a detailed portrayal of the society of that time. The old society, buffeted by the tides of the era, was beginning to crumble, but reactionary forces were putting up a vigorous struggle, a last gleam of resistance; these frosty leaves were as intensely red as spring flowers.</p>
<p>Mr. Mao Dun has set this story in a small county near a city, which allows for the removal of superficial elements and enables the reader to see the conditions of Chinese society at that time more clearly, also making the theme more prominent.</p>
<p>Here, there is conflict between the old landlord class and the new bourgeoisie, with intrigue, backstabbing, and open attacks; here, there is also the perplexity and anguish of intellectual youths with a sense of justice. The author weaves these threads together into a moving epic.</p>
<p>Representing the old landlord class is Zhao Shouyi and his group, who have been occupying the charity hall's savings for more than a decade and refuse to disclose the accounts. Opposing them is Wang Boshen and his group, representing the new bourgeoisie, who, under the pretext of establishing a poor people's vocational training center, want him to relinquish the fat he has been enjoying. But Zhao Shouyi immediately counterattacks, pointing out that Wang Boshen's shipping company's ships run in shallow inland rivers, constantly causing the river water to erode the banks of the villagers' fields. Zhao Shouyi then sends his henchmen, Xu Shixiu and Cao Zhicheng, to instigate the farmers to attack the ships. Wang Boshen uses the police to suppress them, killing a village child. This matter escalates, but they reconcile. One side's capital is the disadvantaged villagers and the life of a child, while the other side's capital is the charity hall's public accumulation, public property. It is still the common people who suffer the loss.</p>
<p>The intellectual youths, perplexed and anguished, include Zhang Xunru, the young master of the Zhang family. His family arranged for him to marry his current young mistress, but he is in love with his cousin, Xu Jingxin. He always wants to go out and do something, but his grandmother wants him to stay at home and guard the family's property. He is dissatisfied with the status quo, but he is unable to change his current environment. The second is Xunru's brother-in-law, Huang Heguang, who has enough family wealth to live comfortably for the rest of his life, and a beautiful and talented wife, but due to his physiological shortcomings, he cannot fulfill the duties of a husband, nor can he carry on the family line. He has also become addicted to opium as a result, becoming listless, and he is unwilling to simply waste his life like this. The third is Xunru's cousin, Qian Liangcai. Among these three protagonists, he is the most ambitious. He has passion and courage, and sincerely wants to do something for the locality, willing to sacrifice his own interests. When the ships destroy the fields, he opposes Cao Zhicheng and the others' incitement of the villagers to attack the ships, and instead teaches the farmers in the region to narrow the land and build dikes, sacrificing a small number of low-lying fields to protect the interests of the majority, with the losses being shared by everyone. He proceeds with the belief that it is "beneficial to everyone," but when he understands that everyone is unwilling but obedient, his confidence is shattered. In the struggle between Zhao Shouyi and Wang Boshen, he also emerges, wanting to exchange a small life for a public good in the locality, but in the end, he becomes a difficult person, and the ones who benefit are still Zhao Shouyi and Wang Boshen. His perplexity and anguish are deeper than those of Xunru and Heguang.</p>
<p>Why did the reform movements of that time accomplish nothing? Zhu Xingjian, a gentleman out of step with the times, said in the book: "... We have learned a bit from others when it comes to electricity and chemicals, but when it comes to laws and regulations, it is completely disorganized. Why is that?..."</p>
<p>What is the reason? Huang Heguang said: "I think there are too many people in the world who are neither good nor bad, but could be either, which allows bad people to act with impunity, right?"</p>
<p>"Why does a person become capable of being good or bad?... If it's because they don't know what's good and what's bad, then why can everyone say what's good and what's bad? Since they can say it, why can't they do it?" Qian Liangcai asked: "You, me, the three of us, do we count as part of the group that could be good or bad? If we are also capable of being good or bad, have we ever thought about why?"</p>
<p>At that time, Zhu Xingjian, Qian Liangcai, and others could only understand this much. Mr. Mao Dun did not preach further here, but left this question open.</p>
<p>Frosty leaves red like February flowers, aren't they still that intensely red now? The era has advanced more than twenty years. Regarding this question, are we still holding the same view as Qian Liangcai and his contemporaries!</p>
<p>I feel that Mr. Mao Dun's novels absorb and integrate the strengths of old Chinese novels. For example, in "Frosty Leaves Red Like February Flowers," the arrangement of the story begins with the introduction of the characters and their backgrounds through the idle conversation between Aunt Rui Gu and the old lady when she returns to the Zhang family. Then, through the movement of the characters, the story is brought to another setting, developing layer by layer, and finally concluding with the scene of Miss Wan adopting an orphaned girl. The whole thing is coherent and not forced. Similarly, in the treatment of the characters, he uses direct descriptions, indirect support from the mouths of other characters, as well as the protagonist's own dialogues, debates, and analyses, to make each character's personality and characteristics very vivid and prominent. These are all things we often see in old novels. There are many such examples in this book, but due to space limitations, I cannot list them in detail here.</p>
<p>Mr. Mao Dun's writing style excels in plain description, being clear, steady, and detailed, developing layer by layer, without being forced or artificial, and without deliberately trying to be shocking. Readers who are not careful will not easily appreciate this style, and may therefore find it a bit dull.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zuxiang commented that "Frosty Leaves Red Like February Flowers" is somewhat "discussing culture," which refers to the many debates and analyses in the book. But these can be used to express the characters' thoughts and personalities, which is a strength of old novels. As long as it does not fall into the trap of psychological description, this technique can be adopted.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>On Ding Xilin</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Not long after the May Fourth Movement, I saw several early popular plays and farces that were simple and easy to understand. Suddenly, when I saw Ding Xilin's "A Wasp," I felt that it stood out from its peers, a breath of fresh air. It gave us an unusual feeling of novelty. This collection is a compilation of several one-act plays. The dialogue inside is beautiful, humorous, speaking in riddles, which not only doesn't make people dislike it, but makes people like it. Many witty phrases, he really thought them up. Among them, "Oppression" is the most popular, and I don't know how many theater groups have performed it. I once took his "Peking Air" and selected it for my "Junior High School Mixed National Language Textbook" as an example of rhetoric and figures of speech, because this piece constantly says the servant is good, but in reality it is constantly saying the servant is bad.</p>
<p>To commemorate the May Fourth Literary and Art Festival, the All-China Literary and Art Association decided to invite this writer from the May Fourth era to give a speech and perform his "Oppression." In this time of housing shortage in Shanghai, it is also very meaningful to restage this play. The day before yesterday, I made a special trip to the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica to see him, to arrange things in advance. It was raining lightly at the time. Although I felt a little inconvenient, I still went with an excited heart. Finally, in a reception room, I saw him walking in with a leisurely pace. His head was already covered with a lot of white hair, and his kind smile gave people the feeling of a caring mother. I suddenly became a child, bathed in the warm glow. He told me that he would be going to Nanjing on the day of the Literary and Art Festival, because the Academia Sinica was building an observatory there, and he had to go and see it. Although he was not invited, and later "Oppression" was not performed, I was still happy to have the opportunity to see the writer I admired. I still walked out of that garden with its tree clumps moistened by the light rain.</p>
<p>Also on a misty, drizzly day, at night, I put on my raincoat and went to the Carlton to see the premiere of Ding Xilin's new work, "When the Wife Comes Home." Coincidentally, Xilin was sitting in the row in front of me, attentively watching his own creation. First, a short play "Three Dollars in National Currency" was performed. Both of these plays wrote about servants, but they are different from "Peking Air." The former narrates how the young master and young lady pull the maid to sit down and drink tea together, and the maid sits down uneasily after declining. The latter narrates how a university student, dissatisfied with a female homeowner firing a maid, breaks her other vase in spite, and then pays her three dollars in national currency, because this is the price she set for the maid to pay for breaking the vase. Both of these points illustrate what kind of person the author is, sympathetic to the maid's plight.</p>
<p>"When the Wife Comes Home" is about a father who is a traitor, and his eldest daughter and son-in-law agree with him, but his wife, son, and younger daughter are opposed to this. The result is that the three dissenters leave. The son packs his bags one morning, preparing to leave without his mother knowing. Unexpectedly, the mother comes downstairs and tells him that the sound of him packing his bags would wake anyone up, and also tells him that she has bought three boat tickets, and that she and her younger sister will leave with him. As she is about to leave, she tricks the eldest daughter, saying that she is taking the son to get the luggage, and also gives the maid a lot of money. The maid is confused and asks the eldest miss, who tells her to ask the madam "when the wife comes home."</p>
<p>This play was written in the third year of the War of Resistance. If the environment at the time had allowed it to be performed, it would definitely have caused the audience to applaud enthusiastically. National integrity should always be promoted, but the era and demands of today's audience are already different. Although I, a shallow person, do not understand "Miaofeng Mountain" very well, just as I don't understand Cao Yu's "Peking Man," I still like "Miaofeng Mountain." It contains the consistent style of the "Xilin One-Act Play Collection," and the fantastic events and dialogues gave me a novel stimulation. The style of these two plays now is different from before. It seems that it has gone from being flamboyant to being plain, or rather, it is more closely approaching realism, easy to understand, and approachable. It is probably because Mr. Ding felt the great impact of the War of Resistance, and witnessed many moving events, that he wrote this righteous play with a sense of justice. At this time, he didn't have time to care about his skills. He didn't want to use those small tricks anymore. He only felt a surge of power urging him to write, and he wrote it down in one breath, until the play was almost finished, when he breathed a sigh of relief and then thought of the "Xilin style" again, so he gave us an unusual ending at the end.</p>
<p>After the play was over, two people stood up to help his wife button up her raincoat. I shook hands with him and said goodbye, and took the opportunity to ask him a few questions about the script. He was quite flustered, perhaps afraid that people would discover or notice who he was. This shows his humility. He is not the Oscar Wilde who walks around with a lily in his chest.</p>
<h3>Wild Cat (Fiction)</h3>
<p>— Chi Zhao</p>
<p>These past few days, after school, as I take my three children home from school, Lan'er, who is only five years old and not yet in school, always has a lot of news to tell us. Pouting her little mouth and waving her little hands, she says:</p>
<p>"This morning, the mum downstairs bought two chicken-chickens!"</p>
<p>"Loquat fruits are seven hundred dollars a pound. The jealous aunt in the front building bought a big basket!"</p>
<p>"Ah Ye ate two zongzi at noon today!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>Her conclusion each time is: "Daddy, let's buy them too!" At that time, her index finger is always in her little mouth, showing a greedy look.</p>
<p>Lan'er's words are of the greatest interest to her third and second brothers, and they listen the most attentively. But whenever Lan'er says, "Daddy, let's buy them too!" the eldest brother always pulls her little hand, disturbing her and saying, "Tell your brother to go with you!"</p>
<p>Seeing the situation on the road and in the neighbors' homes, I also know that the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching. However... when I think about that issue, I am always silent in the face of the children's innocent demands. Ren'er Xin is a twelve-year-old child. Growing up in a poor environment has created a melancholy personality for him. Perhaps because he is older than his three younger brothers, he seems to understand more about human affairs. He is often the one who solves problems in the family. However, whenever I think of the "precocious" personality of the eldest son, which has been formed through suffering, I feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>It was the day before the Dragon Boat Festival, late at night. My wife inspected the sleeping state of the four children. She breathed a sigh of relief and lay down on the bed. At that time, I had also finished grading the exam papers. She said:</p>
<p>"The day after tomorrow is the Dragon Boat Festival. The children have been watching people buy food and eat it these past few days with longing eyes. It's quite pitiful. We should also buy some to mark the occasion."</p>
<p>"Hmm!" I was thinking.</p>
<p>"The landlord downstairs bought a斗 (dǒu, a unit of dry measure) of glutinous rice and wrapped more than a hundred zongzi. The front building also bought five升 (shēng, a unit of dry measure). Others have bought chickens and loquat fruits. We should also buy two 升 (shēng) of glutinous rice, two pounds of loquats; although we can't afford to buy chicken, we should also buy two pounds of fish and meat. The children haven't eaten meat for a month or so, and we should let them be happy during the holidays. It's pitiful to just watch others eat," my wife said, rattling off a whole lot more.</p>
<p>When it comes to the children's plight, what father doesn't understand the reason? And my family's four children, because they are usually accustomed to not being in a situation where "every request is granted," are therefore particularly obedient, and listen to their parents' instructions about what to say and what to eat. They have never howled or stamped their feet to ask for food or play. However, when I think that celebrating a festival in my wife’s proposal will cost two 斗 (dǒu) of rice's value, wouldn't two 斗 (dǒu) of rice support a family of six for ten days of porridge meals? I hesitated, and I was even more silent. I thought of myself as a poor teacher, the last of the scholar-official class. My monthly earnings are only tens of thousands of dollars, which is not enough to support a month's living expenses, so where would this extra expense come from?</p>
<p>"You, what do you mean?" My wife urged for my answer, as if she was impatient with the silence.</p>
<p>I sighed and got up, picked up a cigarette and smoked it. The sleeping postures of the four children were reflected in my eyes. I walked closer to their bed and gently stroked them—their malnourished faces and limbs. I finally agreed to my wife's suggestion, and said that the cost could not exceed ten thousand dollars.</p>
<p>In the light, I saw the red in my wife's face, which was overworked and therefore thin and sallow, and the tightly furrowed brows also relaxed. She also said excitedly, as if forgetting the fatigue of the day:</p>
<p>"Fish and meat will definitely be more expensive than usual during the festival. It's better to buy them early tomorrow and cook them well so that we can eat them on the day of the festival."</p>
<p>The next day, when the children woke up, my wife told them what they were planning to buy today. The three youngest children clapped their little hands, but the eldest son was still indifferent, urging them to wash up, while Lan'er didn't even wipe his face. He hurriedly ran out of the room to tell his little companion in the same room:</p>
<p>"We are buying fish, meat, and loquats today, and wrapping zongzi." He said, spitting out foam.</p>
<p>"Chicken-chicken? Are you buying it? We have chicken-chicken." The little girl downstairs asked him.</p>
<p>Lan'er hurriedly ran back and pulled his wife's clothes, saying:</p>
<p>"Mommy, are we buying chicken-chicken?" He opened his eyes wide, waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>"Buy, buy, buy everything!" The eldest son said angrily before his wife could answer.</p>
<p>"Buy, buy, buy everything! Lan'er also rushed to the railing and said to the little girl downstairs.</p>
<p>When I came home from school, my wife had already wrapped the zongzi, simmered two bowls of braised pork, and there was also a piece of fish. Needless to say, the loquats were also bought.</p>
<p>The braised pork was so cute, simmered in soy sauce until it was golden and shiny, piece by piece like "mahjong tiles," with a fragrant smell that attracted several pairs of small eyes, blinking and sparkling at it.</p>
<p>It was dinner time, and because the children couldn't forget it, we had to allow each person to eat two pieces of braised pork first, and their little faces were filled with smiles. The Lan'ers just sucked the meat to eat with their rice, unwilling to swallow it.</p>
<p>"Today's meat price is two thousand five hundred dollars a pound. Each piece is worth more than one hundred dollars. Taste it carefully," the wife said, also showing a smile proudly, but the eldest son stuck out his tongue.</p>
<p>"Last year's Dragon Boat Festival, when using counterfeit money, it was only one thousand five hundred dollars a pound. This year it has risen by another thousand. Everything has risen in price in recent days, making it difficult even to eat vegetable roots!" the wife said with emotion.</p>
<p>After dinner, after washing and changing the children, my wife considered the problem of placing the fish and meat, because the weather was hot, and if they were placed in the cupboard, they would probably rot, which would be a pity, so the result was still to decide to place them on the table by the window, where the ventilation was the best.</p>
<p>The children were looking forward to having good things to eat when they woke up the next day, and were already sound asleep. My wife was busy all day, and today it was even more like she had completed a major event, and she fell asleep soundly. I was even more like I had fulfilled my best responsibility, and I also slept peacefully, only to be awakened once by the cats吵闹 (chǎonào, noisy) outside the window, and I pushed my wife beside me, but she was unaware.</p>
<p>On the morning of the Dragon Boat Festival, when I had not yet woken up, I was awakened by the voices of my wife and children. I felt as if something had gone wrong.</p>
<p>"What's the matter? Why are you making noise so early?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Daddy, Daddy, the wild cat stole the meat and fish," the children shouted.</p>
<p>"Mommy put the fish and meat on the table last night, and the cat ate them!" The eldest son also said with a complaining tone.</p>
<p>I got out of bed and saw my wife looking frustrated, with tears in her eyes. The piece of fish was gone, and half of each of the two bowls of meat was gone. I couldn't help but be stunned.</p>
<p>"It must be more than one dead cat that ate so much," my wife said softly. "Almost half of it ate up at two thousand five hundred dollars a pound, and that piece of fish also bought two thousand five hundred dollars," my wife lamented.</p>
<p>I wanted to say that I had heard the cats吵闹 (chǎonào, noisy) last night, but I was afraid that my wife and children would blame me, so I had to change my tone to comfort them and say:</p>
<p>"It's okay, it's okay, it only ate half of it."</p>
<p>Afterwards, my wife and I discussed that this matter should not be publicized to the co-tenants and neighbors, because if the fish and meat were eaten by the cat, it would be okay to buy them again, but we could no longer afford to buy them, and if we didn't buy them, we would be laughed at, so it was better not to let people know about this matter, and we could only starve our stomachs, put on a brave face, and pretend to be decent. The three older children were sensible, but I was afraid that Lan'er would leak the secret, so my wife was scaring Lan'er, saying that he was not allowed to tell anyone about this kind of thing. In Lan'er's little mind, it was as if a major event had happened in the family, and he was just sullen all day, and he did not tell anyone about it.</p>
<p>Although I did not agree with my wife's suggestion, I thought that I could not live apart from the group, and even more out of sympathy for my wife's situation, so I did not say anything. It was just pitiful that the children were also taught to lie by my wife.</p>
<p>That day, we ate dinner behind closed doors, and my wife and I just silently listened to the sound of our neighbors and co-tenants drinking and playing finger-guessing games, but the children were still happy, because there was still meat to eat that had been eaten by wild cats, and there were loquats to eat, and there was...</p>

<h3>Greetings</h3>
<p>— Ren Quan</p>
<p>Friend!</p>
<p>Although it has only been a day, it feels like a century has passed!</p>
<p>From the moment we shook hands and said goodbye in front of ×× Hall this morning until now, as I sit alone under the quiet lamplight at home writing this letter, it feels like I've had a bewildering dream. It seems distant, yet it is undoubtedly real. Though real, it’s light and distant like a dream. Even though I know this is unavoidable, a fact that must be faced, I still prefer to savor it like reliving a dream. Now I've reached a conclusion—I am now sitting alone under the lamp writing a letter, just like the first night we entered the dormitory years ago and wrote a letter of peace to our parents.</p>
<p>Did you sleep well last night? I was afraid you might have caught a cold. Although everyone forgot about the cold due to excitement, the night breeze carried the chill of autumn. "The stars are not those of last night; for whom do I stand in the wind and dew?" But who could bear to miss this last evening spent together at our alma mater? Heaven itself seemed to have specially arranged the most beautiful and moving evening for us. The moon, which hadn't appeared for days, finally showed its face last night. And it brought us the most affectionate and gentle illumination, letting us bask in its loving light, indulging in boisterous noise, and laughing to our hearts' content. All the sounds of the city around us had died down. Only the wind whispered in the treetops. Our youthful laughter echoed in the embrace of our alma mater, and it will resonate forever. On every June 15th night, it will become a distant and eternal echo.</p>
<p>Finally, we saw a lunar eclipse again; for many of us, it was a novel experience. And how coincidental that we witnessed this celestial phenomenon last night. When we watched the full moon being swallowed by the shadow, we all felt a sense of gloom. Could it be that it was so quick, that it was full then empty? It made us think of the separation that was about to befall us. We even shed tears sorrowfully; for the friendship that had lasted from the time we wore braids until graduation, we shed tears facing this beautiful universe. The bright tears will crystallize and illuminate the many, many days to come. I once had this saying, "A man's tears are only shed for mountains and rivers." Tonight, I feel that these tears are worth shedding.</p>
<p>The stars shifted, and we continued to talk and laugh. The beautiful future appeared before each of our eyes. In the highest and most beautiful hope, we established our confidence. Why can't we make tonight the most meaningful night in our future memories? Silently, we all made a vow to take on the work of making this world a better place. Now, we feel the existence of both the great and the insignificant. Although some of us have had minor grievances, from now on, I believe, they should all be gently released from our silent mutual understanding.</p>
<p>In a person's life, there are many serious and beautiful responsibilities; these responsibilities are unconsciously shouldered and unconsciously completed. In the past, when we entered school, we didn't understand things, we only knew how to run, jump, laugh, and make noise. However, unintentionally and imperceptibly, we have shouldered a serious and beautiful responsibility. We are here to seek knowledge, to enrich ourselves, and to educate ourselves. Now a stage can be declared complete. The classmates who have lived together during the years of the fall are about to part ways. Unconsciously, we have taken on another serious and beautiful responsibility, which is mutual love and friendship. If we can fulfill it, we will have completed one of the most valuable works in the universe. If countless people other than us can fulfill it, the world will become a more suitable place for humans to live.</p>
<p>Last night, I couldn't sleep at all. In the depths of the night, I seemed to hear someone sobbing softly. My heart was truly troubled, and I could only repeatedly recite the lines from "Cherishing the Past" until I fell into a daze. The night was too short.</p>
<p>Friend, we should always be together.</p>

<h3>Jottings from the Sculpture Studio (II)</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>Types of Sculpture</p>
<p>Sculptures can be classified into various types based on the materials used: wood carving, stone carving, clay sculpture, terracotta, dry lacquer, bronze casting, ivory carving, iron engraving, etc.</p>
<p>Wood carving and sculpture are more prevalent in Eastern cultures than in the West. They also possess unique techniques and flavors, and have a long history. In Western wood carving, a clay model is first made, then cast in plaster, and finally carved according to the model (the process for stone carving is similar). In Eastern cultures, however, such as with wooden Buddhist statues in temples, they are mostly carved from a single piece of wood, sometimes with separately added hands and feet. Although their forms may not be as realistic as those in the West, their ancient, solemn, and serene expressions are far beyond what Western works can achieve. In Eastern sculpture, especially in China, there is an ancient method of using hemp cloth and lacquer. Buddhist statues sculpted by Yang Huizhi of the Tang Dynasty in Jiaozhi, Suzhou, nearly a thousand years ago, remain complete to this day. This is something Westerners can only dream of, because in the West, sculpture is merely used as a practice or as a model for bronze casting, stone carving, or wood carving. Suitable woods for wood carving include camphor, cypress, cherry, cassia, *P. henryi*, and boxwood. In our country, devout men and women seek purity and sincerity when carving Buddhist statues, and sometimes use sandalwood, though this is rare. Camphor is resistant to蛀木虫, boxwood is easy to carve, cherry wood has beautiful patterns, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Artists also have their own preferences. In the Western Middle Ages, wood carvings were often used for temple decoration, and there are many contemporary sculptors who excel in wood carving. Maillol can be considered one with a particularly strong interest. P. Gauguin also made many wood carvings of local people in Tahiti, which are quite interesting.</p>
<p>Stone carving was very common in ancient Egypt and Greece. They mostly used white Carrara marble from Italy, which is fine, smooth, and produces beautiful statues. Many modern artists also use it, including Rodin. Stone carving was also popular in ancient China, but gradually declined after the Song Dynasty. Although some people still advocated it in the Ming Dynasty, their numbers were very small. Surviving examples include the stone figures and animals in front of the Ming Mausoleum in Nanjing. Their techniques, influenced by Hungary, differ from those of the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<p>Dry lacquer carving involves sculpting with a mixture of pottery clay, sawdust, and raw lacquer. The Ji Gong statue at Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou was made using this method. It does not crack over time and is exceptionally sturdy. In recent years, the Japanese have adopted this method, but the Chinese no longer value it.</p>
<p>Bronze casting was very popular in both the East and West in ancient times. The process is as described above: first, a clay model is made, then cast in plaster, then in sand, and finally molten metal is poured in to create the final product. Gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead can all be used, but bronze is most common. The process is quite complicated.</p>
<p>Ivory carving: In the Western Middle Ages, it was often used to carve images of the Virgin Mary. In China, during the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was often used to carve images of Guanyin. Western and Eastern art resonated in this way.</p>
<p>Iron engraving: Because the carving knife is like a pen, it is used to engrave bamboo objects. Many Easterners excel in this technique and have a strong interest in it, perhaps because of the abundance of bamboo.</p>
<p>Terracotta is made of pottery clay and fired in a kiln after being formed. It has become quite popular in the West in recent years. Yixing in China also produces it, but it is all made by craftsmen, so the artistry is low-level.</p>
<p>Based on the techniques of carving, there are several categories: three-dimensional carving, relief carving, intaglio, and line carving. Three-dimensional carving refers to sculptures that can be viewed from all angles. Relief carving and intaglio are hybrids of sculpture and painting. Like paintings, they can only be viewed from one side. The difference is that in addition to visual appeal, they also offer a sense of touch. Line carving is better described as painting than sculpture, as it only differs in the tools used.</p>
<h3>A View on Love</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Zhongyuan Jun wrote a piece called "Mother" in the Spring and Autumn column of this newspaper, and I felt as if the words were filled with sincere tears. When I finished reading the last sentence, I felt a wave of unbearable emotion and tears welled up. Of course, I also share the same motherly love as Zhongyuan Jun, and my mother has also left this world, but I don't have the wonderful pen to portray it as vividly as Zhongyuan Jun. My view on love is that no human love can compare to the greatness of maternal love. Since ancient times, maternal love for children can be said to be all-encompassing, truly genuine, and pervasive. Everyone can understand it. However, there are very few children who love their mothers, and some even despise them. Daughters are more obedient and considerate. You should know that if you don't love your mother, your children may not treat your wife as a mother in return. Therefore, in a family, we should first transfer the love for our wives to the love for our mothers. First, to repay them, which is as it should be. Second, to set an example, first for our wives to see, then for our children to learn, isn't that right?</p>
<p>Between men and women, one can only speak of selfishness. Selfishness is self-centered and is not pure or sincere. To put it bluntly, it is nothing more than mutual exploitation. There is no emotion, let alone love. Therefore, maternal love is the truly supreme love of mankind.</p>
<p>I hope that writings like Zhongyuan Jun's "Mother" will be published more often in newspapers so that those who do not understand the true meaning of maternal love may shift their focus on the idea of love.</p>

<h3>Double Flying (66)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo had to comfort Mrs. Weng Er for a while. Fortunately, her own mood was not infected. She was still happy with the anticipation of boundless hope. She did not quite understand what Shi Yulou had said just now, and she did not need to understand. The only thing she was concerned about now was tomorrow's glory. She imagined that after Lihua went on stage tomorrow, the entire audience of the theater would applaud and cheer for Lihua. Then, the theater manager would give her a thumbs-up and ask to sign a contract with her. From then on, Lihua would become the star of this theater. From then on, she could get a "salary" every month (fixed remuneration for actors). From then on, her life would be carefree! Thinking of this, she couldn't help but smile as she prepared the long clothes for Lihua to wear for the New Year. She also brought Lihua in front of her and affectionately stroked her, saying:</p>
<p>"Xiao Hua, you'll be ten years old tomorrow, and it's your first time on stage! Don't disappoint Mom! Sing well and perform attentively. In three days, your teacher says you can officially 'start your career.' When you earn money in the future, Mom will let you eat well, dress well, and enjoy a lifetime of happiness."</p>
<p>Lihua didn't make a sound, as if she hadn't heard Mrs. Mo's words.</p>
<p>"Child, don't be shy when you're on stage. Your teacher will play the *huqin* for you, just like at home. Sing the way you sing, perform the way you perform, don't panic at all, don't be afraid," Mrs. Mo urged her again.</p>
<p>Lihua remained silent as before, staring at the ceiling with an indifferent expression.</p>
<p>Seeing that Lihua wasn't speaking, Mrs. Mo thought she was sleepy and urged her to go to bed.</p>
<p>"Go to bed early, wake up early tomorrow to put on new clothes!" Mrs. Mo said.</p>
<p>Only then did Lihua "hmm" and walk away.</p>
<p>In fact, Lihua wasn't sleepy at all. Her mind was filled with chaotic and disorganized thoughts. But she didn't feel any sadness. She just felt strange! Why didn't Mrs. Mo use other methods to let her "earn money"? She knew there were many ways to earn money, for example, she could be a maid for someone. She could sweep, wash dishes, and hold babies. She didn't think these were hardships. She could also go to a tailor shop to sew clothes and do rough needlework for people. She saw many young girls working there in the tailor shop. But Mrs. Mo wouldn't let her! She only chose the path of singing to earn money! Shi Yulou had also said just now that singing was to "amuse people," which was clearly not a good thing. Even Shi Yulou resented this profession, but Mrs. Mo actually wanted her to do it. What was the reason? She didn't understand! But she didn't want to disobey Mrs. Mo. She had been beaten and punished. Since she had learned this profession, she could only do it! As for thinking about going on stage tomorrow, she only had a sense of confusion. She remembered seeing Shi Yulou performing on stage. She, and many others, were staring at Shi Yulou from below the stage, and Shi Yulou didn't seem to see them, just singing his songs. Then, she would also be singing on stage tomorrow, letting many people stare at her from below. Would she be shy? But even if she was shy, she had to sing! So she decided: she would just have to learn from Shi Yulou, pretending not to see the many people and just singing her own songs.</p>
<p>"Singing is clearly something to make people happy, but that bad sister herself mistakenly treats singing as a 'toy'!"</p>
<p>Lihua said to herself. She understood this consciousness, thought of Lihua treating singing as a toy, and couldn't help but laugh.</p>
