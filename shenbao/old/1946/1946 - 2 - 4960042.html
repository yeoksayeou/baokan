<h3>中樞昨晨慶祝無旦蔣主席領導遙拜陵墓　並嘉勉官民努力建國</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶一日電〕今日爲中華民國開國卅五年紀念日，亦爲抗戰勝利後首届元旦，中樞於上午九時在國府舉行開國紀念會，並遙拜　國父陵墓，會後舉行新年團拜，會塲情緒愉快，儀式隆重穆肅。　蔣主席身御戎裝，參加人員則多穿禮服，計到于右任·居正·　傳賢·孫科·馮玉祥·鄒魯·王寵專·吳鐵城·吳鼎昌·商震·程　·白崇禧·陳果夫·召力子·龍雲·陳布雷·朱家驊·何成濬·吳國楨·蕭同茲·陳慶雲·張篤倫等三百餘人。首於國民政府前曠塲遙拜　國父陸墓，蔣主席領導行禮，並獻花，繼由　蔣主席領導，在國府禮堂舉行紀念會。　主席即席致詞，曾就我國被日本使略之內在因素嚴加檢討，並策勵同人加緊努力建國工作，詞旨嚴懇，能度謙和，會塲莫不感奮。詞畢開始團拜，首由全體向主席行三鞠躬禮，主席答禮如議，旋由各文武官員相向一鞠躬，禮成。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶一日電〕中樞一日上午九時慶祝三十五年元旦，蔣主席領導行禮後，即席致詞，主席首謂：此次抗戰勝利，國土重光，固得力於前後方軍民擁護國策，踴躍效命，而各文武同志艱苦相從，患難與共，八年來朝夕勤勞，其對於抗戰之貢獻，亦爲不可磨滅之功績，本席茲代表國家，謹致嘉慰。吾人瞻望前途，深覺國家民族有無限光明，而復興建國在今日實為千載一時難得易失之良機，需要全國有精誠合作之精神，更希望政府同人有規過勸善，日新又新的覺悟。</p>
<p>主席繼對於目前政治之急務，政風之改革與行政效率之提高，作下列具體之指示：（一）復員工作應加速進行，以期早日完成，着手平時建設，各機關應勗勉接收人員，負責守法，廉潔自持，對於接管之土地與接收之物資，應勤加整理，善爲利用，以期化無用爲有用，使有用者更得以充分發揮其效能。（二）行政效率應充分提高，本席去年元旦對於提高行政效率曾列舉「簡化手續』，「澈政令」與「勒政愛民」之必要，希望各位同志勵志自强，本此努力，庶幾不愧爲現代公務人員，而政府機關亦得因此健全進步。（三）建國必先樹立建國的風尚，本席去年雙十節曾提出新速實三點，爲建國的風尚，我們必須力求革新，必須爭取時間，而尤其重要者，必須事事踏實，力求進步。蓋建國工作允難於抗戰，各主管同志必須踏勤奮發，爲民衆表率，始能開建國之規模。（四）自動負責之精神，必須發揚，各機關主管同志以負資力行爲第一要義，任何問題，凡在本身職實範圍之內者，均須自動負責，迅速解決，立刻實行，而不必待上級之督促與推動。本席年來提倡分層負責制，用意即在養成吾人自動自愛之習慣，以期辦事迅速敏捷，權責更見分明。（五）辦事應講求聯系，注重合作。政府各機關隸屬雖有不同，實際本爲一體，各部門同級機關之間，均當緊密聯系，切實合作，而中央與地方利害與共，休戚相同，更應彼此關顧，協同一致，始能收指臂相使之效，允須知政府最大的職責，在於爲人民謀幸福，解除人民之痛苦，所以不論中央地方各機關，必須體察民衆的需要，實現民衆的願望。</p>
<p>主席最後說明，現在抗戰雖已勝利，但因環境仍極艱難，建國工作十分重要，今後一年將爲我革命建國成敗之樞紐，當此歲首令節，希望各同志本已往之成績，作進一步的發揚，革故鼎新，來創造新的風氣，發揮新的力量，以完成我們在復員工作中，建設三民主義新中國的神聖使命。</p>

<p>蔣主席致詞</p>
<p>一九四五年很快的就要過去了，這是人類歷史上最値得紀念的　年，這一年曾經結東了多年殘酷狂妄的侵略，實現了我們聯合國的共同勝利。</p>
<p>爲了紀念我們的共同勝利，所以我們特地在今天晚上，宴請我們的貴賓馬歇爾元帥，而今天又是我們貴賓六十六歲的壽辰，對這種聯合，我們更覺得歡欣，我們想到馬將軍對贏得這次世界勝利的巨大貢獻，我們今天晚上的聚會，更加上了重大的意義，我們不僅歡迎馬將軍的惠臨中國，而且能够和他一起來，慶祝一九四六年新年的開始，我們應該如像過去爭取勝利一樣，更特別努力，以求建立世界的永久和平。　馬將軍是一位力行而寡言的偉人，他是着重實際，而不重形式的，他具有敏捷的決斷，崇高的目的，銳敏的眼光，實在是卓越軍人的模範。他這些優美的性格，値得大家的效法，本人深信，凡我國民尤其是我們國軍官兵，一定以他爲我們的楷模。本人對於馬將軍的事業，素表欽佩，一如杜魯門總統稱讚馬將軍所言：「他在構成擊敗德國及日本的戰略中，其貢獻較之其他任何人更爲重大」。</p>
<p>本人謹代表國民政府及我中國人民，向杜魯門總統的特使馬歇爾將軍致誠摯的敬意，歡迎他蒞臨我們中國，現在請大家共同舉杯，祝賀杜魯門總統的健康，祝賀馬歇爾將軍的大美成功和康健長壽，祝賀我們聯合國的共同勝利，永久合作。</p>
<p>馬歇爾答謝</p>
<p>今晚承蔣主席和夫人爲鄙人生日設宴款待，覺得非常高興，而且很榮幸，今後我每逢生日，將永建不會忘掉這次的生日。</p>
<p>將主席在演說中，提到我的地方，我委實愧不敢當，今後人類文明的發義與毀滅，繫于我們社會與社會，國家與國家間是否能够合作，所以我們社會與社會，國家與國家，必須要合作了解與忍耐，只要能達到道目的，那麽世界永久和平就有了保障。我今天晚上特代表杜魯門總統，向蔣主席　中國國民表示敬意，這種敬意，是非常眞誠的，敬祝蔣主席與夫人健康。</p>

<h3>配合物資與技術　完成我交通建設</h3>
<p>— 俞飛鵬</p>
<p>中華民國二十五年之元旦，亦即抗戰勝利後首次之新年，回顧旣往，瞻望將來，創鉅痛深，彌用驚惕！</p>
<p>我國幅員四百餘萬方里，人口將近四萬萬五千萬，而工業落後，交通不暢，國民政府奠都南京後，全國政令漸趨統一，對於交積極進行。截至二十六年間，全國鐵路計一七·二三二公里，機車一千四百餘輛，客貨車二萬二千餘輛，公路一一五·七〇二公里，汽車六二·〇〇一輛，通航路綫二〇·三三三公里，輪船五四〇艘，五七六·八七五噸，飛機二九架，方期機續建設，　於富强。不意七七事變，外侮猝至，慘淡經營之交通，頻造軍事之破票，八載以還，後方鐵路可以通車者，僅餘一·四五九公里，機車二〇六輛，客貨車二·八四三輛，公路五二·一二三公里，汽車一一·四二三輛·航綫僅剩內河六·六四八公里，輪船不足七萬噸，飛機五八架，以此極少數交通工具，應付戰事艱鉅任務，加以敵機濫炸，修復不易，滇緬封鎖，外援不繼，艱難困苦，已達不可收拾之境地，所幸各員工不遭險阻、克盡厥職，終能克服環境，博復勝利，此在抗戰史中，不能不　為一種偉續。據查報所得：我交通員工因公交傷者一·六五二人，犧牲殉職者四·一八六人，壯烈精神洵足稱道。</p>
<p>現在盟邦多已實行復員，我國則因長期抗戰，受創獨深，合計後方原有交通設備，通同最近已經接收者，除東北各省及台灣尚無確實統計外，計鐵道一萬二千二百四十公里，公路十一萬七千餘公里，機車××××輛，客貨車×××××輛，汽車×××××輛，　行輪船××××艘，但以經久使用，或多殘破待修，若按我國人員面積計算，距離實際需票，實感所差尚鉅‘而匪徒隨時破壞，復員遝輸，影響允太。今後錦配合整個交通需要，端在努力臺設，除經擬定戰後五年交通建　計創，呈准分期實施外，本年　最低限度，必須將下述各事辦烈。</p>
<p>關於殲道者，擬將收復區破壞路轉稅　，儘速修復，全部通車，，同時關整管理機構，健全人事，增進運輸效能，並請政府向國外訂購各種鐵路材料，以備興修各路之用。關於航運者，除儘量利用原有及接收敵僞船隻，合理調配，撳任長江，及沿海復員工作外，並請政府向國外訂購輪船，以謀發展海洋航運。關於公路者依照計劃，完成國這網，統一工程標準，分區設局管理，一面積極整理業務，一面建立地方運輸機構，與扶植開放民營公司，俾工程與運輸劃分辦理。關於電信者，仍暫以無綫電爲主，擔任短時期內後方與收復區之通信，同時繼續搶修及加强各地有綫電設備，配合軍事與政治之需要。關於郵政儲匯者，以其過去具有相當基礎，且接收情形，亦尚順利，今後惟在力謀改進，普遍發展，切實達到爲民衆服務之目的。關於航空者，今次復員，對於運送重要人員與軍實，中國中央兩航空公司已盡最大努力，當由政府予以扶助，促其健全，同時積極發展民航事業，適合國際趨勞。</p>
<p>抑有進者，交通事業，與軍事文化經濟農工，一切庶政，息息相關，現在各國水陸空交通，隨時發展擴充，在戰事期間，進步允速，其戰後技術上之改進，當更日新月異，要皆人才與物資配合獲致之成就。我國今後建設，一切主要之交通工具，勢必仰給國外輸入，而此種新型工具之使用，必須儲有大量專門技能之員工，始能勝任。環顧國內交通人才，極感缺乏，技術程度，亦難配合，是培植與訓練專門技術人才，實爲切要之圖，自當迎頭趕上，以竟事功，深冀國內賢達，盟邦人士。本諸以往匡　指導之熱忱，繼續助我完成交通之建設，行見我國交通發達，地方經濟繁榮，對於國際當必有所貢獻也。</p>

<h3>日皇頒詔書願意領導人民　走向民主之路　麥帥昨發表聲明表示欣慰</h3>
<p>〔路透社東京一日電〕盟軍最高統　麥克阿瑟元帥頃發表聲明，以示贊成日皇之元旦詔書。其曾有謂，日臬之言，余聞後甚為喜慰。日皇已準備領導日本人民之民主生活。負起今後其在自由生活上之責任。日皇之決意，可以表示強有力主義之力量，強有力之主義，固決不致遭受　遏也。麥帥之言，乃官方公然支持日島之第一次言論，故頗堪予以重視。蓋日皇應吾列為戰犯而受審判，固巳爲爭辯之焦點也。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京一日電〕日皇裕仁元旦向民衆發表詔書稱：日本於連年戰事之後，慘遭失敗，民衆難免感覺不安與失望，朕心殊爲關切。國內現正發生激烈變動，人民道德墮落，結果所演，民衆思想已有陷於混亂之趨向。朕與民衆站於同一立塲，憂樂與共，以互信互愛爲基礎，聯繫一致，而非根據無稽之神話與傳說。日皇並非神聖不可侵犯，日本人亦非世界最優秀民族，生而統治全球者。如日本國民能堅強團結，渡過當前難關，安然享受文明生活，則不僅日本，即整個人類前途，亦將趨向光明。明治天皇於一八六八至一九一二年御宇時曾宜佈五項誓言，載諸憲單，規定日本民衆在政治上有發言之權，保證人民一律平等待過，增進民衆智識，使帝國日臻安康。此項警言理恕崇高，其重要自不待言，今願重申此誓，使日本恢復自立。　章所載誓言，其原則必須遵守，更應勇往直前，剷除過去一切錯誤，切實體察人民要求，建設新日本，全國上下，將於平安歲月中，共同獲得更豐富之文化，民衆程度亦將提高。茲決以不屈不撓之精神，復興日本憲章所載五項誓言如下：（一）建立議會，政府一切措施，應根據民衆輿論。（二）全國上下應共同團結，積極推行國政。（三）全國民衆應與文武官更相同，可實現其正當希望，以免不慊。（四）過去成法仍將遵守，一切行動將以公平正直爲依據。（五）力謀增進人民之智識與地位，以促進帝國幸福。</p>

<h3>浙省敎育革新計劃　許廳長紹棣對記者表示</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州特訊〕浙敎育廳長許結棣，任職已十一年，在抗戰八年中，尤著勞續，頃吿記者，對於今後浙省敎育革新計劃，菲常詳盡，特誌如次：</p>
<p>此次由雲和返杭，所經各地瘡　滿目，校舍　壞甚多，元氣大傷，欲恢復舊觀，恐非二三年內所能爲力。抗戰雖經結東，然各校陸續遷回原址，仍爲逃難式之遷移。各方渴望學校恢復，熱心人士所予學校之助力，固亦有之，然勝利後仍有遭受若干不應有之破壞與損失情形實不忍欲言。</p>
<p>甄別從寬辦理</p>
<p>又抗戰期內對於學校之地域分配，已多調整，此次本欲照原定計劃，作全盤籌劃支配，使之更爲合理，惜各方面於傳統觀念，一時無法貫澈。至收復地區師資之甄別與檢定，均由當地政府自行酌定。至僞校學生學籍之整理，當用考試方法甄別之。在僞政府所辦之學校讀書，自不免受奴化敎育之影轡。然靑年求學，多迫於環境，究與從逆不同，甄別當從寬辦理，一部仍予以補習敎育完畢後，即可甄別，並分發各校或轉學。黃主席以抗戰勝利，提出「敎育第一」口號，但建國有賴於敎育，自不待言。</p>
<p>注重科學敎育</p>
<p>此次世界戰爭，勝利與失敗，均決之於科學。科學落後之國家，雖有強國之名，必無强國之實。日本投降後，謂日本是科學的失敗，中國是外交的勝利，其言含有深意。過去敎育之制度，有甚多缺點，無庸諱言。至抗戰期內素質之低落，自有若干自然之因素存在。一般人對此點批許，尚多隔靴播癢之談，未盡中肯。此後應行革新之點甚多，故此後敎育擴展計劃，千頭萬緒，未可以一二語了之。唯應重視科學之研究，則可斷言。故充實設備等，自屬急需之事。敎育爲百年樹人大計，非咄嗟可辦。即言復員，經八年之破壞，亦非一朝一夕即可達成復員目的，本省改進計劃，當分期辦理。</p>
<p>今年為敎育年</p>
<p>黃主席提出三十五年為敎育年辦法後，三十五年度擬提積榖三十萬擔，附加帶征二十萬擔，又勸募十萬擔，以之充作敎育事業補助經費，並將逐年繼續行之。此項經費，大部爲充作設備之需。學校敎育，當以重質不重量。主席之意，謂百年大計成功，不必自我，故計劃宜務求其遠大云云。此自是久長之計，唯望能貫澈施行。</p>
<p>提高敎員待遇</p>
<p>同時為重視敎育事業起見，當提高敎員待遇，使之較公務人員務高。又以優秀靑年，多屬清寒子弟，敎育機會應予平等，故當設法予以補助，使得深造。此次行政會通過，本廳即可依此等原則之指示，擬定辦法實施。（蝶）</p>

<h3>中央工專計劃復員　建校舍需卅億元</h3>
<p>〔大　社重慶航訊〕中央工業專校，自獲准遷返南京後，即召開復員委員會，積極擬具復員計　，全部內容甚爲遠大周密，分遷校，充實，擴展三步，期於一年內現有師生均可全數遷回南京，五年之內將專科及職業部之機械，土木，化工，電機，航空，建築，紡織，礦冶八科，均能增全，以後並擬增添工學院，附設初中及小學。若該項計劃全部完式，當可成一擁有三四千學生最完善之工業學府。惟該校南京校舍，已全部被燬，此次遷返，勢須重新建築，現正請工程師湯匯川繪製設計圓樣，初步預算共計三十萬萬元，已呈請敎育部審核，一俟　准，即將派員赴京開工興建。</p>

<h3>足球聯賽昨日民幕　合羣韓僑各一和局　上半時未開紀錄</h3>
<p>新生之上海足球聯賽，於昨日元旦展開序幕。下午甲組處女賽，合羣以二比二和韓僑，膠州公國，情况尚稱熱烈。</p>
<p>韓僑爲鷄林化身，於硬幹作風外，昨有默契純熟之小派司演出，惟射門殊欠準鵠，合羣在上半時中，似亦忘帶「射門鞋子」，致各以一雙鴨蛋結束。二寸分鐘時，韓僑獲一十二碼良機，由中堅李時東執罰，恰中姚崇胸懷，遂成泡影。檸標後九分鐘，蕭子文於門前十五碼處低射開紀錄，三十六分鐘，韓右鋒金文鉉疾趨直下，姚崇衝出不及，被金輕輕一撥，斜中左下角，遂成各一平手。再越四分鐘，韓左鋒黃琮淳於二十碼外截獲來球，起左足遙吊，竟飄進右上角，姚措手不及，韓僑遂以二比一後來居上。相隔一分鐘，合羣反攻，深及門下，韓門將洪普植持球拍地，蕭子文乘機一撞，從膀下漏進，合羣獲此意外收穫，遂以各二和局。</p>

<h3>釋言論自由</h3>
<p>— 章士釗</p>
<p>開歲爲祖國康復後之第一年，步入强國之林，渙汗憲政之號，國人且從此享受自由權利，誠甚盛事。雖然，自由何義？享受何等？自政府以至於庶人，未必有瑩澈之概念。茲請以言論爲項目，於焉釋之。</p>
<p>吾國之有近代法律思想，承流於日本，濫觴於大陸。大陸法系之區別自由，各予限制，與英美之完全放任者不同。吾法意沈浸於大陸者旣久，故即共和告成，報律不期而著。錄元年南京內務部，今司法院居院長爲次長，曾頒此律三條，上海各報爲之大鬨。時吾爲同盟會機關民立報撰文，亦根據英美法爲之言曰：</p>
<p>『詮英倫出版自由號眞切者，莫若曼斯福。曼氏以名法官立爲界曰：「出版自由非他，乃出版無需預求特許是也。必出版後有違法事件發生，始依法處理。」葉倫波亦名法官，又有言曰：「英吉利法律，自由之源泉也。自由蓋對特許而名。特許兩字，在國法實無用處。如人欲出版，則出版而巳，無他經營也；至違法處須受審判，亦與他違法事件等耳，非於出版獨異也。」兩家之言如此。夫謗律者，非報律也。其得稱爲報律，無過特許、審查、及保證金之類。前淸報律，舉三者而有之。今內務部則僅標特許一項。尋英吉利之憲法，全建築於個人權利之上，此雖似英憲特點，實則憲法之爲物，亟當如是。何以言之？如有人欲作一書與其友人，此固有之自由也。此人又欲刊行其書以公衆覽，此亦固有之自由也。又設此人欲日日作善與其友人，欲日日刊行其書以公衆覽，並多其數以至百千萬億張，其亦爲固有之自由，又奚待問，前者謂之通信自由，後者謂之出版自由。此兩自由者，非異物也。謂出版自由必特特許，通信自由又胡獨吾？推而至於甲欲向乙發言，此其自由也，乙欲向丙及丁發言，此其自由也，此不待特許也。甲欲向乙在某地發言，乙欲向丙及丁在某地發言，甲乙欲向丙丁同在某地發言，果須待特許吾？前者謂之言論自由，後者謂之集會自由。知此理也，則甲乙欲向丙丁戊己，以至千百萬億人，日日同在某地發言，日日同在某地刋行共言，以至千百萬億張，宜爲自由必然之序。是何也？即出報自由也。英憲名宿戴雪敎授，揭藥不越於是。』</p>
<p>吾重述此段議論，頗有重感。蓋當時內務部所頒報律三條，極爲平凡，祗令出報者註冊爲止。乃共和初日，自由之幟驟張，大聲一呼，政府因而退聽，卒之所謂報律三條，內務部撤回畢事。顧爾後袁氏當國，下逮其他北洋政府，無不有變本加厲之報雜發布。國民政府，以訓政名，此律之更加嚴密，夫人而知之。於是國中言論，不問高下疾徐大小輕重，因無不萎縮於層層管制之下，由端得委，疇曰不然？然若南京建極以還，直三十餘年，自由之花，長開不凋，報律云云，自始不見其跡。試問吾國公私議論，其且遠符的翰牛，近同羊乞，平時雍容揄揚，變時慷慨奮迅，是唯不發，發皆中節，謂得曲隨上流社會之理若智，如量章顯，於無牾吾乎？此途人可得而斷言曰，不能不能。不能者何？曰：今之君子實無足她張此類自由故。</p>
<p>或問此類自由，新法律之所賽也，將吾之舊道德不足以因應乎？曰：吾。理之眞者，取時空取能局，吾唯恐舊道德之不篤。篤已，自由且緣此以神其用，何捍格於法之是憂爲？中席曰：『君子之道，本諸身，徵諸庶民，考諸三王而不繆，建諸天地而不悖，質諸鬼神而無疑，百世以俟聖人而不惑。』此古聖之極詣，即自由之範圍。何以言之？人之初生，榛榛狉狉，欲言則言，欲語則語，無所謂敎化，無所謂禮義。敎化禮義之旣起，始知言者爲我，聞言爲人，逕情直行，諸有未便，是中庸之身與庶民也。再進乎此，將幽而鬼神，明而天地，過去而三王，未來而百世聖人，均不得不自身與庶民推類至盡，以求其相與浹洽。本斯以談，名爲自由，其實極不自由。聖人者，即於極不自由中，容頭過身，遊刃有餘之代表人物也，古今人類中，聖人有數，因之眞解自由者亦有數。國家果何賴乎置此可望不可即之自由爲？曰：不然。理一而已，共中不無大小輕重之等差，語其極，聖人有所不能，語其概，愚夫愚婦不難與知·聖人更剴切詳明，爲蚩蚩者氓樹之義曰：『有一言可以終身行之者，其恕矣乎！』蓋恕者，如心之謂。如實論之，不外以己之心，度人之心。持此以律自由，即隨往而無所於滯。夫立於天地，欲稱秉彝，雖曰智量不齊，難通繫賾，而人己朗期，指點可明，謂將不知恕字作何解說，殊難置信。故恒人曰，舊道德不適於新自由，無有是處。</p>
<p>至新道德之於自由，取義云何？尤爲軒豁。英諺曰：『自由自由，當以他人之自由爲界·』提出界字，與吾中席所談人己，乃至鬼神天地三王百世等號，適成一揆。昔穆勒著自由一書，義例絕瑩，嚴幾道譯作羣己權界，雖不無移義作名之失，而要爲愜心貴當之稱。謂國人不足享用自山，將無異謂國人不知若而權界。諸公自訊，以爲何如？</p>
<p>吾嘗謂政府限制自由，終有幾許未曾限制處，善爲用之，未始不恢恢乎其有餘。何以言之？政府不限制時，吾且陰設種種覆畢以自勵，今政府所設，亦不過　墨而已。雖彼亦一限制，此亦一限制·廣狹未必蒙而相掩，而吾之自由，縱極醇正，必且出入於重重檢束之中則同。爲問國人所欲保存之檢束何種，所欲排除者又爲何種？復問政府所欲執持之檢束何種，所欲放任者又爲何種。</p>
<p>怯於公戰，勇於私鬥，國民之劣根性也。繩之言論，即懈於主張，勤於攻訐，乃相應而見其然。且所爲攻訐之激隨，每倚對抗力之强脆爲衡。凡放肆而視無後禍者，用力允暴。此共抹摋正誼，專對人以自抒憤盤，誠哉劣之劣處，艱於爬梳，一言蔽之，公私不明，言無準則而已。</p>
<p>至訓政之效，更與自由無涉。蓋訓政者，墨子尚同之術也。墨子之言曰：『上之所是，必皆是之，上之所非，必皆非之。上同而不下比者，此上之所賞，而下之所譽也。去若不善言，學國君之善言；去若不善行，學國君之善行。察國之所以治者何也？國君唯能壹同一國之義，是以國治也。』此訓政之極致也。凡宜傳機關之所專心致志者，不離此物也。若夫自由則反是。自由者，尙異之所生也。吾嘗為政本論，開宗明義曰：『爲政有本，本何在？曰，在有容。何謂有容？曰，不好同惡異。』此非吾一人之私言也。白芝浩嘗重視巴力門論鋒之烈，謂英倫政治，實先天下而以評政爲政。其政府黨，在政治用語曰王之僕，在野黨曰王之反對黨。以王爲的彀而集矢焉，是以王當天下之衝。不僅與吾墨家上同之誼相違，即彼邦君主不能爲惡之大義，亦不期而相叛。故此語初出，世頗駭之，而英人卒奉爲科律，用臻上理。梅依曰：「政黨之德，首在聽反對黨之意見流行。』穆勒曰：『二黨之爲用也，共一之所以宜存，即以其一之有所不及。而其所以利國，即在此相攻而不相得，乃有以制用事者之政力，使之常循理而惺惺。』英人之所爲善用其自由者如此。一言以蔽之，拙篇所署不好同惡異五字而巳。</p>
<p>今人言政，好標榜英美，實亦吾方捧心而效之。自由自由，即其眉目之一然自由不能無因而至，更不能張口而得。吾曩持戴雪之說，深恐其啓人在易之感也，茲請以白芝浩之言折之·</p>
<p>『以言文明，至吾英亦可觀矣，而其中儘有不少之人，其知識淺深，無以異於二千年前之大多數，其他優者，亦無以逾於一千年來之所謂俊秀焉。不然，今之居乎下流中流社會，褊狹頑鈍而麻木者，何其多也！聞者疑吾言乎？則試反爾家，行爾廚，執爨婦若庖丁，對之而演說，如爾以爲最明最暢最確切不移之理，而彼以爲晦，爲不可解，爲荒謬絕倫焉；如爾鈎沈探賾之所得，今僅出其最爲平易近人者語之，而彼以爲在，爲野，爲異敎焉，則吾說爲不妄也。須知大羣如大山，山質數層，惟羣化亦有之，共下層之特質，與謂於上層爲近，寗謂於鴻荒爲近。由是論政之家，不以數層之所不同，懸諸坐右，時時而省覽焉，則其所論，勢將至於澈底皆誤，且猶之用文錦以覆陷　，人之顚於是者必衆也。』</p>
<p>今吾視數十年前之英倫何若？自由之未可驟期，不遜十日並照之明，而委曲孕育之責，政府顧不可卸。夫由訓政達於布憲，同異之問，有如深坑大谷之不可接。若依宣傳舊策，遽望士論休明，裨輔國是，殆與伏而舐天無殊。今後憲政危機，當非一二可數，所望朝野賢達之士，諦視羣己同異之別，以公心實意，明辨而篤行焉，庶乎得進以寸，無退以尺。</p>

<h3>楊文道十載鐵窗　籲請平反寃獄　曾於敵人淫威下被判死刑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕提籃橋上海監獄裏，有一個判次死刑已經十年　的愛國卯犯，正在祈求着在這天日重光的時候，能够平反寃獄，平平安安的走出那座灰色大厦的鐵門。</p>
<p>曲打成招含寃莫伸</p>
<p>這一件案子是有名的「中山秀雄案」，這個被囚十年的　犯人名叫楊文道，廣東中山人楊文道的長子漢校，一個二十八歲的英俊靑年，曾來本館，希望代他父親呼籲伸寃。他說，　發之初，全滬報界公團，甚至參加審判的法官，沒有一個不知道是日本人處心積盧，存心造成事慶，所以故意羅織巨獄。日本警探會在捕房將楊文道私刑拷打達兩個月之久，要强迫他招認係　我長官指使，暗殺中山秀雄。但楊文道深明大義，始終不屈。等到審判的時候，日本人又在法院門口派出鐵甲車，滿載武裝士兵，形勢極度緊張，楊文道終於在敵人淫威之下被判死刑。他還在向最高法院上訴的時候，抗戰軍興，政府內遷，他就被擱在上海監獄裏等判次，直到現在。離開被捕的時候，已經十年了。</p>
<p>天日重光呼籲營救</p>
<p>楊文道彼捕之後，家計窘道已極，他的妻子楊唐氏，不得不把她兩個小　送到孤兒院，還有一個孩子，便流浪到了內地。最初，親友們還有資助的，等到戰事一起，他們原來在塘山路的住宅全部燒光，日本人佔領了上海，就是肯帮忙的親友，也避嫌不敢接濟了。十年以來，他們飽經家破人亡之痛，等到現在，天日重光，他們一等到九月間政府接收上海各機關，馬上就開始營救這個老犯人。他們曾上呈文給第三方面軍，市政府，市黨部，蒙難同志救濟會，廣東旅滬同鄉會……最後，在十二月二十一日，還郵寄一份狀子到南京，呈蔣主席求救。據地院的查良鑑院長表示，他已經呈司法行政部請示。但是家屬方面總以為已往的十年不必說，這勝利之後，最近幾個月的杏無音信，却實在使他們有點焦急。他們正在多方面努力，請求社會各界人士，主持公道，平反這寃獄。</p>
<h3>外籍戰犯　續獲三名</h3>
<p>警備總部稽查處頃近又捕獲爲虎作優之外籍戰犯三名：一爲匈牙利人西飽克，爲日本黑龍會上海分會會長中村大佐之鷹犬，由西出面開設字號，專與敵方搜購軍用物資。另二人爲葡萄牙人，一名雷米狄斯，生於澳門，父爲葡人，母爲日人。於日本佔領期內當改用母姓，名中村雷米狄斯，自稱爲日人，仗勢欺壓華人。雷並爲西鮑克之助手，替日軍部搜購物資，頗有功績。一名雪而維亞，亦爲西之助手，彼等依仗日軍部氣燄，濫行捕人，幽棻於彼等私設之機關內，非刑敵打，受害者多人，已向警備總部告發。稽查處乃於日前將該三外籍浪人逮捕，聞於日內即將解送法院，以戰爭罪犯提起公訴。</p>
<h3>已登記敵人罪行案　達一萬四千餘起　罪行人一律扣留待審</h3>
<p>上海地方法院檢察處奉令辦理之敵人罪行調查，自卅四年十一月六日開始，迄卅四年十二月卅一日止，已登記有一萬四千五百廿八案。開自卅五年元旦日起，已發至二月十七日，除例假外，已發登記號碼二萬七千六百餘號。此項工作，該處原定一月結束，現則迫於情勢，繼續辦理。</p>
<p>犯罪日憲兵概不准回國</p>
<p>又該主持辦理人員，以已登記各案之發生於上海市區者，罪行人以日憲乒爲最多，故已與本市國軍憲兵第廿三團部洽商，同意由該處移送罪行人名單，與該團俘獲管理之日本前駐滬憲兵核對，認明後則不予回國，以供來日審訊之需。又悉，第三方面軍港口運輸司令部，亦函請該處移送罪行人名單，以便於遣送日俘日僑歸國時，予以扣留。聞該處以登記之被害人鄉人極多，對殺人越貨之日寇罪行人，多難舉出完整之姓名，該處已商之港口運輸司令部，將放肆部下爲惡之日高級軍官留置於末批回國，以供審訊。</p>
<p>高院檢察處偵訊灘奸案</p>
<p>高等　法院檢察處，截至卅四年年底為止，已接受本市軍警機關移送至該處之漢奸案件，共有七十七起，其中除已有一部份提起公訴外，餘正在偵訊中。</p>

<h3>上海市政的全貌　（續）　工務局負建設重任</h3>
<p>—本報採訪室—</p>
<p>本報以勝利初臨，市政設施，千頭萬緒，工作艱巨，爲欲明瞭三月來本市布政進展狀况，特分訪市政府及各局各單位，作一有系統之報告。除市政府·財政局·社會局·公用局·敎育局·地政局·衛生局，警察局·民政處等槪况，已刋登元旦增刋外，尚有工務局報告，以篇幅關係，未及同時刋出，深用歉疚，茲特補刋於是，讀者諒之。</p>
<p>上海自經烽火，復遭敵僞蹂躪，八年之間，損失奇鉅。方今抗戰已告勝利，舉國最重要之工作，莫如建設。而建設大上海之重任，實以工務局所負担者最爲艱巨。</p>
<p>工務局局長趙祖康氏，江蘇松江人，現年四十六歲，係唐山交大土木工程系工學士，後由鐵道部派赴美國康奈爾大學研究，回國之後，歷任梧州工務局局長，全國經濟委員會公路處副處長，代理處長，交通部公路總管理處處長，軍事委員會運輸統制局工務總處處長，交通部公路總局副局長，斐托斐榮譽學會會員，國際道路學會會員，全國工程師學會副會長，最近復被選爲該會上海分會會長等要職。</p>
<p>工務局係於卅四年九月十二日接收偽組織之「建設局」，接收之後，工作極爲緊張，而因敵僞破壞之故，任務倍見艱困。全上海之馬路總長度七十萬公尺，而需修之路面達三十四萬方公尺，目前已經修竣者的七萬餘方公尺，全滬橋樑達二百三十座，全數待修。全滬溝渠的五十萬公尺，均待疏濬，目下已修者的四五萬公尺，的全數十分之一。倘材料問題能解決，則今後工程當可加速進展。</p>
<p>此外，全上海八十餘座碼頭亦亟待修繕，而溝渠之中，泥土積存一萬五千方六尺，立須挖除。該局擬利用冬季水寒土凝之時積極進行，俾霉雨季節可以减除水患。</p>
<p>記者曾詢趙氏，戰前之市中心建設計劃是否照舊進行，趙氏答稱，目前擬以整個上海爲對象，從事建設，故較原來之市中心建設計劃，擴充甚多。記者旋詢此項建設，大的須時若干，趙氏謂，養路工程不能以時日限制，若以修繕而論，則八年破壞之後，殊非數月可能畢事也。</p>
<p>工務局目前待辦之工作，爲（一）養路，包括橋樑·碼頭·防水建築·一切公共建築·及公園之修葺及整理。（二）疏濬一切河道·（三）溝渠及汚水管之疏濬，及雨水唧水站之修葺。趙局長對於公園允表關切，謂上海居民繁多，工廠林立，空氣頗嫌混濁，市民之精神上肉體上，均感不舒，故擬對公園多加致力，以增進市民之健康。又擬於本市各工廠區附近建立單幢平民及普通住宅以解決本市房屋問題。</p>
<p>至於市郊公路，目前已經修理者，有通至龍華，閔行，漕河涇，虹橋，吳淞諸地之公路，浦東之浦東大道，亦已開始修理。市中心之公路經過八一三之兵變，業已破壞殆盡，刻亦在積極修葺中。</p>
<p>通往南市之各鐵門，業已拆除，於卅四年年底可以全部拆竣，以利交通。全部路名，現已逐漸加以更改，全部新路名名單，業已發表，預計三十五年元旦即可實施改稱。（全文完）</p>

<p>前幾時，報紙上對新匯率時有揣測，以致報道紛紜。實從而淺見的投機市塲，時而斯多，時而軋空，忙了一陣，結果烚赤依舊回到了八十萬餘的舊價，一般散戶，庸人自擾，東衝西撞，碰了一鼻子灰，漸漸地對金市冷淡了，最近　天，紛紛向美鈔方面集中，一般心理，想從美鈔六百元對十兩，做到五百左右，這是拿美國黑市金價回小至五十七元一盎司做根據，照年底金市，美鈔收盤價推算，適相符合，查美國官定黃金收買價，爲每盎司三十五元，職　時期黑市曾高漲到八十餘元，戰事結束後，長時期徘徊於每盎司六十餘元，每盎司相等於市平一兩略强，是以陪都市塲即以六百對十兩爲依據，本埠方面旣已棄金就鈔，換言之，即美鈔看好之成份，較黃金爲濃厚，但黃金受陪都掛牌所牽制，加之股票奇俏，原來十兩黃金可得永紗或美亞二千股，近已步縮至永紗九百三十股，股票方面獲利後之游資，勢必前來補進黃金，厲時黃金必不至被棄若遺，可以斷言，除非美國金價黑市再見下隆，或我國重訂金價，脫金購鈔者，一時恐難達預期之目的，蓋因每盎司三十五元，旣為美財部官定收買之價而非賣價，該國物價指數，亦高出訂定金價時殊多，而議員方面又多有提高金價之主張，加之我國黃金掛牌，乃根據當初第一次發行價每兩五萬元，加上四成獻金而規定者，短時期內亦不致有所更動也，記者管見，認爲勝利後，當局對整個外匯政策，恐未必即有適當之決定，試觀陪都華北上海等地命價相差若是之鉅，台灣及東九省又各發流通劵等等，殊爲明顯，黃金雖不若美鈔之可以活用，但頗多用作鉅額交易之籌碼，不致與美鈔相離過遠，此後之投機市塲勢必形成長期之拉鋸戰矣。（欽）</p>

<h3>希望</h3>
<p>— 魯莾</p>
<p>「希望」如一顆蓓蕾，準備着長大開花，那溫暖的陽光，晶榮的朝露，乃至細微的迷霧，和煦的春風，都是希望的至友。伴着她，擁着她，盼望她成就。</p>
<p>「希望」的「想像」，便是蓓蕾而後的花朵，我們想像蓓幫蕾完成的花朶是那麼艷麗，芬芳！因此我們希望中的「想像」，又是那麽完好，美妙！</p>
<p>可是希望快要實現，也就是說希望的想像快要不成爲想像時，突然來個變故；正如蓓蕾快要開花，忽然一陣風雨，蓓蕾僵着了，這是如何地煞風景！</p>
<p>「希望」又像個「峨眉月」，孩子們盼望她彌補缺憾，詩人祈禱着增加光輝；情侶們更懷着熱望，準備在湖上，或海濱，渡過整夜。然而團圓的那一天，天邊又忽然上了鳥雲！</p>
<p>這比缺憾未彌補前更缺憾；增加了光輝，轉而黑暗！</p>
<p>「希望」也像根小草，在路旁的小草，正在欣欣向榮時，忽然被一隻大皮鞋踐踏着，霎時間枯萎了，實際上她還不曾到夏大，邊論秋天。</p>
<p>可是假如我們看得大一點，遠一點，這一次的蓓蕾僵落了，還有下一這；這個月的亮月見不到團圓，還有下個月，乃至今年的小草枯萎了，還有明年，野火燒不盡，春風吹又生，什麽我們都有未來。</p>
<p>現在，我們又是產生希望的時候　，我們自然不灰心，我們還是希望，還是想像，而我們希望中的想像，不但仍然是過去想像的輪廓，而且更擴大更美麗了！</p>
<h3>回春之藥</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>每到新年，心就煩！一者爲：沒有許多閒錢應付這個節，「煩」；二者爲：久久漂流在外，思親不能聚首，「煩」；三者爲：編輯先生們逼着要點綴「新年」的稿子，而苦無文思，「煩」。</p>
<p>特別是今年！按說，勝利了；國民生活，該有點好轉了；但，物價澎漲不已；使你仍然處在高壓下，承受着難堪的窘困　按說，勝利了；老百姓們，該都可以凱旋故里；安居樂業了；但，「交通爲難」；使你仍然「有家歸不得」！按設，勝利了；總算從砲火中檢了一條命，該是値得慶幸；値得快慰，有的可述；有的可寫了；但，國家大局，問題太多，使你仍然苦悶，窒息；欲語已無聲；欲哭已無淚；下筆不成文；於是深深感到活着不如死了好！</p>
<p>並非我要過分悲觀，事實上國家生着重病，身爲一國之民，「痛癢相關」，試問：孰能忍？孰能笑？</p>
<p>人的病，因爲謀生；而不得不勞心勞力以服役；久之致於身體不健康，積勞則成疾。復因為沒有錢治療，致於日趨沉重。任其發展下去，便只有死！同一理由，國家的病，因爲政治有問題。局面無法安定，又因爲沒有好的方法導引就範，於是危機四伏。任其演變下去，眞是不堪設想！</p>
<p>人的身體不健康，就是「病」；國家紊亂，就是一病」；人沒有　，就是「窮」；國家的政治不合拍，就是「窮」。病由窮來，窮而後病；愈窮愈病；愈病亦愈窮！正如：「國家紊亂」由于「政治不合拍」一樣。</p>
<p>病有陰陽之分，「陰」潛于內，「陽」形于外。病的進展程序，多半是先陰後陽；也就是先前在內部慢慢地蔓延；然後逐漸向外發展；這又可以謂之爲由輕輕重。其所以這樣，固然一方面受窮的影響，一方面乃爲患者一般具有「諱病忌醫」的心理所害。患者，以「病」爲恥；生了病，絕不肯承認；見了醫生，絕不直陳病情；等到病入膏盲，雖本能的怕死；但已搶救不及！倘若從早注意；加以防禦，並制止其發展；則病又何足盧哉？况且「防禦」和「制止」的方法，不一定非醫藥不可；「粉神療養」，就是最好的防禦和制止初期患病的方法。病旣重之後，只要患者能「縣崖勒馬」，也仍可韓危爲安！這使須患者消除「諱病忌醫」的心理，據實陳述病情于醫生，俾可「對症下藥」。並應絕對遵從醫囑，然則治瘡方有效騐，起死回生方有　！人病如此，國家病也如此。</p>
<p>國家欲强盛，必須無紊亂；而平息紊亂，又必須政治合拍。如何使政治合拍？則必須有好的策略。政治合拍就是國家的本錢；好的策略就是國家的醫生。</p>
<p>中國一直走着惡運道，幾十年兼患着內外科之症，爲了「病」，和「諱病忌醫」，至於纏綿迄今，未獲痊可。現在雖然外科症已好，但內科症却仍在蔓延中。好像一個人患了高熱疾，用大寒之劑，會激成白痴，故應用溫凉之劑。中國目前欲治紊亂，絕不可持武力，乃宜採取一種好的策略，而得和平解決！「民主」，方足以掃蕩病菌，「和平」，方足以恢復健康！民主猶如中國的良醫，和平猶如中國的特效藥！「良醫」，才能製「特效藥」；特效藥，才能治病。</p>
<p>人，患了病，都是希望春天轉好。如今我祝蘇中國，也能在一九四六的春天轉好！我們現在有着高明的醫生，我們只消誠意地請他，讓這位大夫下一副「和平劑」，這「和平劑」便是回春之藥！包險藥到病　，中國從此健康起來，也從此永恒地强盛起來！</p>
<p>和平，不但是中國的回春之藥，也是全世界，全人類的「回春之藥」！</p>
<p>我在這兒熱切地等待着一九四七的新年，我願那時已經回到家裏；更願父親坐在我的身邊，我愉快而寗靜地寫着歌頌「新年一的又車，然後，我再恭恭敬敬地送上編輯先生的大門！</p>
<h3>故人</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>在寒風蕭瑟，冷風悽其的馬路上，突然有人騎了一匹白馬她　着。因着道匹馬的毛色是白的不禁，想起故友楊幸之在川鄂途中的白馬地方覆車喪命的慘劇。</p>
<p>楊　之，是一個忠於職事，待人熱誠，前途有爲的靑年。十年前，他在申報服務，抗戰軍興，他便奮然從我了。</p>
<p>記得我主編逸經文史半月刊的時候，他在軍中寫了許多戰事的珍聞逸事，尤其是　秋白絕筆的「多餘的話」，也是由他將原稿寄給我發表的。這篇稿子，許多刋物都多方設法的找尋無着，他竟把全稿且加了一段很詳細的叙述，寫在文前，給讀者一個明確的參考。</p>
<p>「八一三」滬戰發生，他隨軍到實山抗戰，在軍務倥惚問·他撥冗到霞飛路來訪我。戰雲瀰漫的滬市，故友得着握手歡談，欣慰情緒，難以言喩。我帶他去參觀我和幾位同志所辦的天蟾難民收容所，大家暢談平生的志願，抗戰的前途，將來倭寇慘敗的結果，意志異常相投的。</p>
<p>有兩次，他特約我乘車到前綫去，實際的參觀戰事。我們在戰壕裏，一同和英勇的士兵吃麵包喝開水來充議。敵機轟炸陣地時，和士兵蜷伏在塲底。最險的一次，是在深脊十二時半，乘着一輛在當時環境不能開燈的汽車，駛到前方去。突然間，火光一閃，洪隆一聲，敵方的砲彈打斷了一株大樹，樹身靈時倒落在汽車頭上，車子馬上打了一震，不能够前進。司機和衛士下車，化了許多氣力，才把樹枝搬開，再來開車。行不到兩分鐘，敵方的砲彈接三連四的向我們車子所行駛的路面射擊。路旁墳墓有一石碑，給他打斷斜彈在車旁，車身打壞了，右旁的後輪車胎穿了。車子在黑越越的路面停着，只靠一支手電筒時光時息的照着更換新胎，費了半小時光陰，才得草草修好。</p>
<p>在上海戰事劇烈時，他因公常到特區來，都必順到我的寓所談談。姚子靑營長全營士兵在羅店殉國，就是他們同一部隊的。他曾把這役戰事，說得有聲有色。</p>
<p>有一次，我在前方一間破廟裏，看他審訊奸細。他用了許多方法來鞠問，使　個奸細無法詭辯雖然勉强說些閃鑠之詞，更加反證出他們是作僞心勞日絀的錯誤，終於伏罪了。他說他本八原是弄筆桿的人，平日都是舞文弄墨，今次參加民族對外的偉大戰爭，所見所聞所親歷的事很多。將來輯述成書，也是非常的有意義的。他每見我一次，必說，抗戰材料又得了許多。我極力的鼓舞他去完成這部富有歷史眞實性的傑作。</p>
<p>據說他在民國二十九年覆車殞命之後，遺骸草草的葬在白馬附近的山頭。遺下的寡婦孤兒，現在審跡何方，沒由得知。當年他的長官曾向部下說，待戰事結束，把幸之遺骨移葬街山。今値萬本凋零，朔風怒號的時候，死生契闊，憶念故人，眞有說不出的感　。日閥傾覆了，想幸之在天之靈，也該瞑目吧。</p>
<h3>霧</h3>
<p>— 力夫</p>
<p>幾天來，迷迷漫漫的霧，眞叫人厭膩極了。在沒有霧的時候，這一角小樓中早晨的晴空，麗陽下的大地，柳枝的落照，都像一個特寫鏡頭，那麽詩情靈意的展開在東西窗口。雖然自己不是詩人或畫家，不會在景色裏想出一句美妙的詩，或描成一張畫，但確會從無語的展望裏，感受到快適的陶醉與新麗的滿足。與其說這是逸致閑情，可不如說給生活疲倦了的身心，特別對於舒徐鬆逸的環境，物態來得需要，感受得深切爲妥貼些。因此這幾天的濃霧給與我的觀感也就時別渾濁沉悶，像突然在眼睛前遮上一層白緩，濛濛一片，辨不出方向，高低，寬窄；連呼吸也起了不自然的感覺，似與世界隔絕了。於是，我不由不討壓霧，甚至咀咒霧，因爲它不能讓我暢述胸中的積愫。</p>
<p>人，總愛有個足供自由馳　活動的光明天地。霧，雖然還不至阻礙我，牽制我在人事上的活動，但它可有一股無形無聲的魔力，迷濛住我的心；迷濛住我的眼，使我像墜陷在水沫飛噴的渾濁的海裏，就是莫大的飛機，輪船，無論它有如何大的魄力，也不由它去自由施展運用。雖然霧裏的天空河海可還有着固定的航錢。霧雖然不會把宇宙促成黑影，可是把宇市撤了一團無底的渾濁與朦朧了。</p>
<p>記得一次在海上，輪行遇了大霧，時正子夜，漫天的辦，密畢濛濛向海上蓋下，燈塔的光標朦住了，四而是一片無際無涯的黑暗，潮濕的海風其有北冰洋的寒冷，吹得人打慄，海浪打着船舷發出激怒的漢息，遠遠燈臺的警告笛，穿過霧夜的海面，拖長地，由高而弱，像一隻獸時，哀厲冷漠的發散在濃濃的夜霧的海面，輪上的笛聲也鳴鳴池應附起來了，接着是緊促的鐘聲間歇地敵打起來，一種恐怖的緊張的空氣，幾使人疑慮到船遇了險。這樣在恐怖的警笛與亂鐘聲中度了一夜，直到第二天霧散了，始解除了　氣籠罩的氣氛，輪才辨正了方向前行。從那一次的「霧」給我的駭怕形像實在太深了，但是我更能透澈體會到，惟有安靜忍面的觀察力，能　克服困難的——霧。</p>
<h3>受降曲</h3>
<p>— 蔣蘇宣</p>
<p>三十四年九月二日我徐永昌將軍衛行命於盟邦美　密蘇</p>
<p>里監受日本降九日何上將在京受降</p>
<p>雲烏陣連敵旗靡，龍戰鯨屠鮫窟徒，珊瑚擊碎　綱收，赤水珠還象罔喜，艦艟逐隊薄榑案，富士蒙頭雪流泚，千人針斷萬骨灰，百二十世霸業摧，彈丸嚴限舊封域，使漁悖出理不清　，降王免細與銜豐，中朝命使仗節麾，前徐遠爲殖族類，後徐問罪仲天咸，神州苦被蹂鐵騎，重完諒天意，受降城築十六道，六師御風齊插翅，石城禹域烟水久凄　，蟠踞重生龍虎氣，峨峨上將指投戈，禍首甘心付懲毖，兆民怨毒未備償，寬大轉敎伏正義，眞人嶽降國難紓，鐘卑銘　靑史書，力拯水火登袵席，乘時康濟爭須臾，耽耽窺伺閑內外，家居忍撞隳雄圖，餘生但祈遂飲啄，幾沸熱血聞崇呼。</p>
<h3>葉</h3>
<p>— 宛青</p>
<p>天雖不冷，可是季節到了，爲路上一片一片漂零的都是落葉。窮孩子們在珍惜地拾着，一葉一集的鋪好，惟恐彼此一擁擠，便成了末，碎成粉，燒起來沒有火苗。往年，木柴算不得什麽，誰還會時下身去檢拾落葉。今年，柴火太貴了，又怎能不拾取落葉！於是一籃一袋的，輕飄飄的隨着人們歸去了。貧寒的人家，爐中燃起了火，藍烟　滿了一室，然而飯熟了，燒飯的和吃飯的都在淌着眼淚，雖然在烟霧龍單下淌着眼淚，但是這眼淚是慰安的，並不曾鈎心鬬角的去掠取，也不會巧取豪奪的去打刦。天冷了，老大把該換的樹葉，並無吝色，也不治價，使風輕輕的一吹，便贈給了人們。老犬到底是偉大的，旣不用人們聯名的請求，也不必舉行會議討論，更不曾把名字登在新聞紙上以示招徠。春天，他替樹披上了葉，到炎夏的時節用以來遮進驕陽，秋冬，人們不感到熱的威脅，便飄下來任人拾取，焚燒！</p>
<p>筆底春秋</p>
<h3>試律</h3>
<p>— 慕容隨</p>
<p>在新年的刊物上，談到了許多的「元旦試筆」或「新年試筆」之類，我忽而神經過敏地，覺得有幾點莫名的「感哨」。</p>
<p>筆而僅用於試，已够「虛懷若谷」的了！在某一個時期，大家儘可不試了，可以爽爽氣氣地直說了，然而試的人偏偏還是試，而在某一個時期呢，幾乎連試都試不成了，大家都「盡有戒心」了，而要試的人還是在試！</p>
<p>當然！可試而試，「自古成功在嘗試；」不司試而試呢，「嘗試成功自古無」？這是我的悠喟之一！</p>
<p>試筆的人，僅僅乎試的是一支筆罷了，還有何難？」小京莊」「七紫三羊」「三紫七羊」，大家可試，迎剛啓蒙的拖着鼻涕的孩子也何嘗不可試，而且「新年開筆萬事大吉」，我眞覺得試筆是一件非常悲哀的「頑兒」！倘使不試筆而試刀，「我有筆如刀」或者「我有寳刀」「及鋒而試」豈不痛快！或者我有槍炮，我有飛機大炮，我更有原子炸彈，豈不更痛快而又痛快乎？這是我的感喟之二！</p>
<p>好在試筆究竟不是筆試，旣不是一定爲了什麽「中式舉人」更不是一定爲了什麼得中「第八名進士」。我在這麽想，總還比那些「試刀」「試槍炮」試「原子炸彈」的人「散淡」得多了，這是我的感喟之三！</p>
<p>我又在妄想了：「試筆」眞不妨改爲「戲筆」，比較更「散淡」得多了。我們動筆的人，總喜歡的是「散淡」，能過爲「散淡」而「散淡」，我在想吧！試筆的「同文」們，次不覺得是「動有功而戲無益」的，然乎？</p>
<h3>美術向何處走？該怎樣走？</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>抗戰勝利已快過四個月，大家都忙着復員的工作，我們的美術的一個部門，似乎很少有人提起它。因爲它在八年之中，所貢獻的力量是相當薄弱，無怪在勝利以後的今日，被人瞧不起，確又自落後。</p>
<p>可是，美術要求復興，要求發展，究竟當前的目標怎樣？又如何能够獲取這個目標？這種種，是我們急需解決的問題。</p>
<p>要解決這些問題，自然應該先看一看當前的現實。</p>
<p>在廣大的中國社會裏，一個普遍的要求，是人類的自由與幸福，假使，我們在勝利的中國，還保留了封建的毒氛，還使得大衆受苦，那麽，這種勝利是徒然的。因之，當前的美術應走的路向，在積極方面，是帮助大衆爭取自由與幸福，而消極方面，應該是掃除封建，消減人類利益前途的一切阻障。換句話說：我們的美術，是應該從頽廢到健全，從感傷到愉快，從畸形到合理，決不是唯美主義的「爲藝術而藝術」，也不是狹義的「爲人生而藝術」，應該是「爲人類大衆的藝術」。明晰地說：是表現民主精神藝術。</p>
<p>我們不希望美術的歷史的實複或是搬演，絕對鄙視個人主義，天才主義，英雄主義的美術，以及爲少數人御用的所謂美術家的出現。文藝復興意大利或德意志的美術是好的，中國唐宋的美術同樣也承認他是好的，可是，我們絕對不承認這些東西再現于世界或是中國，因爲現在是廿世紀了。</p>
<p>我們在不否認這些美術的歷史的價値的條件之下，現在我們只有走「揚棄」的一條路。</p>
<p>西洋美術，尤其是西洋畫，它已經是和汽車，飛機一類文明利器而成爲世界所共有的了。因之，中國美術是又應該走西洋美術的表現力的一條路，即採取其器材與技法。</p>
<p>當前的美術旣然州是大衆的，那麽，一切脫離大衆的主觀的表現形式是應該放棄了，即不取中國固有美術中的「寫意」與二十世紀初期歐洲美術奇怪的形式，是應該運用「寫實」的形式。</p>
<p>在西洋繪實中，已洛克〔Bariqye〕與羅珂珂〔Rococo〕時代的寫實是太粗劣與纖巧，自然主義的寫實是太軟弱，我們不妨從法國繪畫的傳統精神中取擷恩格爾〔Ingress〕可爾佩〔Courbet〕塞尚〔Cezanne〕以至於現代的特郞〔Derain〕的寫實，可是還應該取擷中國繪覺中的筆勢氣韻，骨法……這些中國民族文化的特質滲入進去，這是寫實中含有寫意的分子，客觀通過主觀的表現，便是一種新寫實的形式。</p>
<p>基於這樣的表現形式而產生的美術的內容，決不是統治階級鎮攝被統治者的權威的宣傳品，也不是資產階級生活的寫照，或是特殊階級的娛樂品與點綴品，所謂「帮閒」的美術。我們是要求以反映光輝的民主精神爲主題的作品。我們希望有特拉克亞〔Delacroix〕可爾佩〔Courbet〕米勒〔Millet〕獨米哀〔Paumier〕以後畫「流民圖」的鄭俠一類的大家的再生，因爲他們的出品中，曾經表現過輝煌的民主精神，雖然，大家的再生，是不可能的事，可是，我們希望着現在或未來的盡家們，當在構思你的大作之前，對於主題的把握應該向這些，歷史的大家學習。</p>
<p>以表現民主精神爲主題而通過新寫實形式，所產生的作品，是可稱之爲「民主主義的新寫實主義」的美術，是當前大衆所要求的。</p>

<h3>The Central Government Celebrated New Year's Morning. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Led a Remote Homage to the Mausoleum and Commended Officials and Civilians for Their Efforts in Nation-Building.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Today is the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, and also the first New Year's Day since the victory of the War of Resistance. The Central Government held a founding anniversary meeting at the National Government at 9:00 AM and paid remote homage to the Father of the Nation's Mausoleum. After the meeting, a New Year's group greeting ceremony was held. The atmosphere at the venue was pleasant, and the ceremony was solemn and respectful. Chairman Chiang, dressed in military uniform, attended the meeting. Most of the attendees wore formal attire, including Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Chuan Xian, Sun Ke, Feng Yuxiang, Zou Lu, Wang Chongzhuan, Wu Tiecheng, Wu Dingchang, Shang Zhen, Cheng Qian, Bai Chongxi, Chen Guofu, Zhao Lizhi, Long Yun, Chen Bulei, Zhu Jiahua, He Chengjun, Wu Guozhen, Xiao Tongzi, Chen Qingyun, Zhang Dulun and over 300 others. First, they paid remote homage to the Father of the Nation's Mausoleum in the open space in front of the National Government. Chairman Chiang led the ceremony and presented flowers. Then, Chairman Chiang led a memorial meeting in the auditorium of the National Government. The Chairman delivered an impromptu speech, in which he severely reviewed the internal factors that led to China's invasion by Japan, and urged his colleagues to intensify their efforts in national reconstruction. The words were earnest and the tone was modest and amiable, which inspired everyone present. After the speech, the group greeting ceremony began. First, the entire assembly bowed three times to the Chairman, who returned the salute accordingly. Then, all civil and military officials bowed once to each other, and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] The Central Government celebrated the 35th New Year's Day at 9:00 AM on the 1st. After Chairman Chiang led the ceremony, he delivered an impromptu speech. The Chairman began by saying that the victory of the War of Resistance and the recovery of the national territory were due to the support of the national policy by the military and civilians in the front and rear, who volunteered their lives. The hard work and dedication of all civil and military comrades who worked together through thick and thin, sharing weal and woe, day and night for the past eight years, is also an indelible contribution to the War of Resistance. On behalf of the nation, I extend my sincere congratulations. Looking to the future, we deeply feel that the nation and the people have unlimited bright prospects, and that national revival and reconstruction today is a rare and fleeting opportunity of a millennium. It requires the spirit of sincere cooperation from the whole country, and we hope that colleagues in the government will have the awareness of self-correction, mutual encouragement, and daily renewal.</p>
<p>The Chairman then gave the following specific instructions on the current urgent political tasks, the reform of political conduct, and the improvement of administrative efficiency: (1) The repatriation work should be accelerated to complete it as soon as possible and start peacetime construction. All agencies should encourage and urge the receiving personnel to be responsible, law-abiding, honest, and self-disciplined. The land and materials taken over should be carefully organized and utilized to transform the useless into the useful and to allow the useful to fully exert its effectiveness. (2) Administrative efficiency should be fully improved. Last year's New Year's Day, I listed the necessity of "simplifying procedures," "thoroughly implementing government orders," and "loving the people." I hope that all comrades will be ambitious and self-reliant, and strive to live up to the expectations of modern civil servants so that government agencies can be sound and progressive. (3) Nation-building must first establish the ethos of nation-building. Last year's Double Tenth Festival, I proposed the three points of "new, fast, and practical" as the ethos of nation-building. We must strive for innovation, seize the time, and, most importantly, be practical in everything and strive for progress. The work of nation-building is undoubtedly more difficult than the War of Resistance. All responsible comrades must be diligent and be role models for the people in order to open up the scale of nation-building. (4) The spirit of taking responsibility automatically must be promoted. The most important thing for the responsible comrades of each agency is to be responsible and act vigorously. Any problem that falls within the scope of one's own duties must be taken responsibility for automatically, quickly resolved, and immediately implemented, without waiting for the supervision and promotion of superiors. In recent years, I have advocated a tiered responsibility system, the purpose of which is to cultivate our habit of self-reliance and self-respect, so as to handle affairs quickly and efficiently, and to clarify rights and responsibilities. (5) We should pay attention to connection and cooperation in handling affairs. Although the government agencies belong to different authorities, they are actually one entity. The same level agencies in each department should be closely linked and cooperate effectively. The central and local governments share common interests and concerns. They should care for each other and be consistent in order to achieve the effect of using fingers and arms. It must be known that the government's greatest responsibility is to seek happiness for the people and relieve their pain. Therefore, all agencies, whether central or local, must understand the needs of the people and realize their wishes.</p>
<p>Finally, the Chairman explained that although the War of Resistance has been won, the environment is still extremely difficult, and the work of nation-building is very important. The coming year will be the crux of the success or failure of our revolution and nation-building. At this time of the New Year's Day, I hope that all comrades will further develop their past achievements, get rid of the old and establish the new, to create a new atmosphere, exert new strength, and complete our sacred mission of building a new Three Principles of the People China in the repatriation work.</p>
<h3>Building a World of Lasting Peace. Chairman Chiang and Marshal Marshall Offer Mutual Congratulations on the Allied Victory</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 31st] Chairman Chiang and his wife held a grand banquet at the Shantung Lin Yuan residence on the eve of the New Year's Day of the Republic of China's 35th year, commemorating the common victory of the Allies and celebrating Special Envoy Marshall's 66th birthday. Ambassadors to China, senior generals of the US military headquarters, central executive committee members, standing committee members, national government members, heads of various ministries and commissions, and chairpersons of the Political Council, totaling 151 people, attended. During the banquet, Chairman Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall gave speeches successively, mutually congratulating the Allied victory and permanent cooperation. The banquet ended at 10:30 PM with everyone thoroughly enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Speech</p>
<p>The year 1945 is quickly coming to an end. This is the most memorable year in human history. This year ended years of cruel and arrogant aggression and realized the common victory of our United Nations.</p>
<p>In order to commemorate our common victory, we are hosting our distinguished guest Marshal Marshall tonight, and today is also our distinguished guest's 66th birthday. We feel even more delighted with this union. Thinking of General Marshall's great contribution to winning this world victory, our gathering tonight has even greater significance. We not only welcome General Marshall's visit to China, but we can also celebrate the beginning of the New Year of 1946 with him. We should work even harder, just as we did in the past to achieve victory, in order to establish lasting world peace. General Marshall is a great man of action and few words. He emphasizes practicality rather than form. He has quick decision-making, lofty goals, and keen vision. He is truly a model of an outstanding soldier. These excellent qualities of his are worthy of everyone's emulation. I firmly believe that all my people, especially our national military officers and soldiers, will take him as our model. I have always admired General Marshall's career, just as President Truman praised General Marshall, "His contribution to the strategy of defeating Germany and Japan was greater than that of anyone else."</p>
<p>On behalf of the National Government and the Chinese people, I would like to extend my sincere respect to President Truman's special envoy, General Marshall, and welcome him to China. Now, please join me in raising a glass to the health of President Truman, to the great success and health and longevity of General Marshall, and to the common victory and lasting cooperation of our United Nations.</p>
<p>Marshall's Reply</p>
<p>I am very happy and honored that Chairman Chiang and his wife hosted a banquet for my birthday tonight. I will never forget this birthday every time I celebrate my birthday in the future.</p>
<p>I am ashamed of Chairman Chiang's mention of me in his speech. The meaning of the advancement or destruction of human civilization in the future depends on whether our societies and societies, countries and countries can cooperate. Therefore, our societies and societies, countries and countries, must cooperate, understand and be patient. As long as we can achieve this goal, lasting world peace will be guaranteed. Tonight, I would like to express my respect to Chairman Chiang and the Chinese people on behalf of President Truman. This respect is very sincere. I wish Chairman Chiang and his wife good health.</p>

<h3>The Guangdong Women's Circle</h3>
<p>Fights for Seats in the Senate</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 1st] The women's circle here has sent telegrams to the Central Government, earnestly requesting that it be expressly stipulated, and women's groups have sent two representatives each to jointly petition the municipal party and government agencies for seats in the Senate.

<h3>Marshall is Scheduled to Fly to Shanghai on the 8th</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] According to relevant sources, Marshal Marshall will fly from Chongqing to Shanghai on the 8th, and then go to Peiping.</p>
<h3>Zang Qifang is in Charge of the Northeast Education Repatriation Work. It is Said that as Long as It Can Be Remedied, the Future is Still Extremely Optimistic</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Peiping, 1st] Zang Qifang, the white-haired president of Northeast University, is currently in charge of the Northeast education repatriation work. Mr. Zang is not pessimistic about the shadow of the enslaved education imposed on the Northeast youth for the past fourteen years by the enemy and puppets, believing that as long as it can be remedied, the future is still extremely optimistic. Based on his experience in contacting Northeast school teachers and students in Changchun, the national and ethnic concepts of Northeast youth seem to be stronger and more vigorous than those of youth in the interior. Speaking of the principles of Northeast education repatriation, Mr. Zang said: We will try our best not to delay students' coursework and maintain their original grades as much as possible. The differences caused by the different school systems will be remedied as much as possible. In terms of teachers, Japanese teachers below the middle school level will be dismissed across the board. Research institutions can retain Japanese personnel without political backgrounds. As for general teachers, those who have acted as accomplices during the occupation will not be investigated for the past. In terms of textbooks, national standard or approved textbooks will be adopted completely, printed and distributed locally. As for the future development path of education, national education should strive for universalization, middle schools should focus on production education, and implement a 4-3-3 system, that is, ordinary middle schools account for 40%, vocational and normal schools each account for 30%, and university education should focus on gifted education. In the past fourteen years, the quantitative aspect of Northeast education has developed greatly, with 2.1 million elementary school students, 600,000 middle school students, and 30,000 university students. However, the qualitative aspect is extremely insufficient. Very few universities have liberal arts departments, and agriculture, engineering, and medicine departments are also developing abnormally. The enemy really does not give Northeast youth the opportunity to study political and social issues.</p>
<h3>The United Nations Military Council Has Requested. Our Government Dispatches Commander-in-Chief He to Attend as Representative</h3>

<p>[Our newspaper, Peiping, 1st] President Song's main task in Peiping is to restart those motors that have been mostly dormant after being received, so that they can rotate again for China's repatriation and nation-building. In addition to a few most necessary receptions, President Song stayed in Jurenhui Hall almost all day long, discussing with relevant ministries and commissions which agencies should receive enemy and puppet industries, how to resume work, and how to raise funds for resuming work. It is said that several principles have been initially determined: (1) Factories of the same nature that have not started work will be merged and started.

<h3>The Hope for Unity is Growing Stronger. Yan'an will Soon Reply to the Peace Proposal</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] San Francisco, broadcast at 2:00 AM on the 2nd: According to the latest news, the hope for unity in China is stronger than ever before. It is said that in the talks between the two major political parties in China last night, the National Government put forward a substantial peace proposal, to which Yan'an will pass a resolution and reply within 48 hours.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper] San Francisco, broadcast at midnight on the 1st: In response to the Communist Party's request for a ceasefire, Chairman Chiang will allow the Communist Party to participate in the coalition government, but the Communist Party must abandon its independent army.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 1st] Chairman Chiang has formally asked General Marshall, the U.S. special envoy to China, to mediate peace between the government and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 31st] Neutral politicians believe that Chairman Chiang's New Year's Day speech to the military and civilians shows that the National Government is prepared to establish a coalition government in order to peacefully resolve the civil war, but they point out that Chairman Chiang's speech contains several conditions, such as the disbandment of the Communist army and administrative organs, the cessation of the Communist army's attempts to sabotage transportation, and the obstruction of the National Army's reception and occupation of areas. They pointed out that Chairman Chiang did not mention the Yellow River or the Northeast, nor did he address the Communist Party's proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. They believe that this indicates that the National Army's political and military position is becoming increasingly strong, no different from a warning to Communist leader Mao Zedong, "Stop all acts of disobedience, and then we can begin negotiations." Chairman Chiang has decided to convene the National Assembly on May 5th. Although the Communist Party still opposes this, Chairman Chiang does not intend to change this decision and has indicated that he is willing to increase the number of Communist Party representatives.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 31st] The China Democratic League sent a letter to the National Government and the Communist Party, requesting that a "ceasefire" order be issued on New Year's Day of the 35th year to "give the people a new beginning."</p>

<h3>National Army Recaptures Fuxin; Liu Duoquan Arrives in Jinzhou to Join the Army Heading to Rehe</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 1st] According to reports received today, the National Army has recaptured Fuxin, located 70 miles northeast of Jinzhou. Simultaneously, other troops are advancing towards Xinmin, 30 miles northwest of PanYang, and the areas of Yingkou and Chaoyang.</p>
<p>[Beiping, This Newspaper, 31st] Rehe, which has been occupied for twelve years, is about to return to the embrace of the motherland. This morning, Liu Duoquan led his secretary, Mo Songheng, civil constitution director Tan Wenbin, construction director Mao Shaoqing, and 22 senior officials from various provincial committees, leaving Beiping by plane to Jinzhou to advance with the army. The National Army on that front had already advanced to Yixian when Liu left Jinzhou, and it is expected that Chaoyang and Lingyuan will soon be recovered. Once the National Army enters those areas, the provincial government personnel will follow the army in to begin their work. Before his departure, Liu paid visits to President Song, Li Zongren, and Xiong Shihui, and had detailed discussions regarding the takeover of Rehe. The province will also use the Northeast circulation currency in the future, as the monetary system in the region has rapidly become unified with that of Manchukuo over the past twelve years. The special commissioner dispatched by the Central Bank to Jin County has recently requested the authorities to establish a branch bank in Rehe Province to handle financial matters.</p>
<p>[Jinzhou, Central News Agency, 1st] Rehe Chairman Liu Duoquan led the heads of various departments of the provincial government and important officials to Jinzhou at noon on the 31st. They will follow the takeover troops from Fuxin into Rehe to assist the troops in starting to promote the political affairs of Rehe Province.</p>
<p>[Qing, United Press, 31st] It is reported that the National Army has launched a large-scale pincer military operation, with its powerful flanks steadily advancing towards Rehe Province.</p>
<p>Communist Troops Retreat from Changchun; Mo Dehui Inspects Police Stations</p>
<p>[Beiping, This Newspaper, 1st] A person from Changchun said: The current situation in Changchun is not much different from a month ago, except that the municipal government has been taken over, the Central Bank has opened, and the ground is covered with snow. Although the mayors of Harbin and Shenyang, who arrived in Changchun, have taken office, they find it difficult to predict the future of the takeover and generally adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The Communist troops have retreated from Changchun, but individuals resembling Communist soldiers can still be seen in the city. After 5:00 PM, people still keep their doors closed, as do personnel from the Administrative Headquarters. Allies generally have a very good impression of the Northeast, so many have purchased properties in Changchun and other places. Because they cannot distinguish clearly, some have mistakenly purchased public property, which will be a major problem when dealing with enemy and puppet property in the Northeast in the future. There are currently four rear reporters in Changchun, all of whom are unusually depressed and unable to express their suffering.</p>
<p>[Changchun, Central News Agency, 31st] Mo Dehui inspected the police station and detention center here on New Year's Eve and gave a speech to the officers, encouraging them to perform their sleepless duties with the heart of a strict father and kind mother. The bureau has only been taken over by the new director for four days, and public security in the city has already improved.</p>
<h3>Coordinating Materials and Technology to Complete Our Transportation Construction</h3>
<p>— Yu Feipeng</p>
<p>The New Year of the 25th year of the Republic of China, also the first New Year after the victory of the War of Resistance, looking back at the past and forward to the future, the deep wounds and great pain make us more vigilant!</p>
<p>Our country has an area of over four million square miles and a population of nearly 450 million, but its industry is backward and its transportation is inadequate. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, national political decrees gradually became unified, and active progress was made in transportation. Up to 1937, the country had a total of 17,232 kilometers of railways, over 1,400 locomotives, over 22,000 passenger and freight cars, 115,702 kilometers of highways, 62,001 automobiles, 20,333 kilometers of navigable waterways, 540 ships with 576,875 tons, and 29 airplanes. We were planning to continue construction and strive for prosperity and strength. Unexpectedly, the July 7th Incident occurred, and foreign aggression suddenly arrived. The painstakingly managed transportation infrastructure was frequently destroyed by military operations. In the eight years since then, only 1,459 kilometers of railways remained operational in the rear, with 206 locomotives and 2,843 passenger and freight cars. There were 52,123 kilometers of highways, 11,423 automobiles, and only 6,648 kilometers of inland waterways, with less than 70,000 tons of ships and 58 airplanes. With this extremely small number of transportation tools, we had to cope with the arduous task of war. In addition, enemy aircraft indiscriminately bombed, making repairs difficult, and the Yunnan-Burma Road was blocked, resulting in a lack of foreign aid. The difficulties and hardships reached an unbearable level. Fortunately, all employees persevered despite the dangers, fulfilled their duties, and were finally able to overcome the environment and win victory. This cannot but be praised as a great achievement in the history of the War of Resistance. According to reports, 1,652 of our transportation employees were injured on official duty, and 4,186 sacrificed their lives. Their heroic spirit is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Now, many Allied countries have already implemented demobilization, but China has suffered the most due to the long-term war of resistance. Counting the original transportation equipment in the rear, together with what has recently been taken over, excluding the provinces of the Northeast and Taiwan, which have no accurate statistics, there are 12,240 kilometers of railways, over 117,000 kilometers of highways, ×××× locomotives, ××××× passenger and freight cars, ××××× automobiles, and ×××× ships. However, due to prolonged use, many are dilapidated and in need of repair. Calculated according to the area and population of our country, the actual needs are far from being met, and bandits are constantly destroying facilities, hindering demobilization and transportation, which has a great impact. In the future, to coordinate the overall transportation needs, the key lies in striving for construction. In addition to having drafted a five-year transportation construction plan for the post-war period, which has been submitted for approval for phased implementation, this year, at a minimum, the following matters must be handled vigorously.</p>
<p>Regarding railways, we plan to repair the destroyed railways in the recovered areas as quickly as possible to restore full operation. At the same time, we will reorganize management institutions, improve personnel systems, and increase transportation efficiency. We will also request the government to order various railway materials from abroad to prepare for the construction of various lines. Regarding shipping, in addition to maximizing the use of existing and taken-over enemy and puppet ships, reasonably allocating them, and assigning them to the Yangtze River and coastal demobilization work, we will also request the government to order ships from abroad to develop ocean shipping. Regarding highways, we will complete the national network according to the plan, unify engineering standards, set up bureaus in different regions for management, actively organize business, and establish local transportation institutions and support the opening of private companies, so that engineering and transportation can be handled separately. Regarding telecommunications, we will temporarily rely on radio as the main means to undertake communication between the rear and the recovered areas in the short term. At the same time, we will continue to repair and strengthen wired telecommunications equipment in various places to meet military and political needs. Regarding postal savings and remittances, because they have a considerable foundation in the past, and the takeover situation is also relatively smooth, we will only strive to improve and develop them universally in the future, and truly achieve the goal of serving the people. Regarding aviation, in this demobilization, the China and Central Aviation Companies have made their best efforts to transport important personnel and military supplies, and the government should provide support to promote their soundness. At the same time, we will actively develop civil aviation to meet international trends.</p>
<p>Furthermore, transportation is closely related to military affairs, culture, economy, agriculture, industry, and all other aspects of administration. Today, the transportation of water, land and air in various countries is developing and expanding rapidly. During the war period, progress was unusually rapid, and the technological improvements after the war will be even more rapid. All of this is the achievement of coordinating talent and materials. In the future construction of our country, all major transportation tools will inevitably rely on imports from abroad, and the use of these new tools requires a large number of employees with specialized skills to be competent. Looking at the country's transportation talents, we feel a great lack, and the level of technology is difficult to match. Therefore, cultivating and training specialized technical talents is an essential plan. We should catch up to achieve success. We deeply hope that domestic talents and people from allied countries will continue to help us complete the construction of transportation with the enthusiasm for guiding us in the past. We will see the development of transportation, the prosperity of the local economy, and we will surely make a contribution to the international community.</p>

<h3>Emperor Issues Edict Willing to Lead the People on the Path to Democracy; MacArthur Expresses Gratitude in Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, Reuters, 1st] Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, General MacArthur, recently issued a statement expressing his approval of the Emperor's New Year's Edict. He stated, "I was very pleased to hear the Emperor's words. The Emperor is ready to lead the Japanese people in a democratic life, taking responsibility for their future freedom. The Emperor's determination can demonstrate the strength of a powerful ideology, an ideology that will never be suppressed." MacArthur's remarks are the first public expression of official support for the Japanese Emperor, and are therefore worthy of attention. The fact that the Emperor should be listed as a war criminal and put on trial has been a point of contention.</p>
<p>[Tokyo, United Press, 1st] Emperor Hirohito today issued an edict to the Japanese people, declaring that the Emperor is not sacred and inviolable, and that the Japanese are not the most superior race. MacArthur was deeply gratified and said that the Emperor had begun to lead the Japanese people on the path to democracy, clearly adopting a liberal and laissez-faire attitude towards Japan's future.</p>
<p>[Tokyo, United Press, 31st] In order to abolish Shintoism in Japan, MacArthur issued an order today prohibiting the use of history, geography, and ethics textbooks in all Japanese schools unless they have been approved by MacArthur's headquarters. These textbooks and teaching methods will be confiscated. According to Lieutenant General Dyke, head of the MacArthur Information Education Group, these textbooks are full of nationalistic ideas and must be thoroughly revised. MacArthur's order is not because the Japanese are lazy in reforming the content of their textbooks, but rather because he wants to implement his previous plans to reform Japanese education. The Ministry of Education has been ordered to develop alternative teaching materials and prepare a new textbook compilation plan. These temporary textbooks will be available to schools next spring after they have been completed. All confiscated textbooks will be destroyed and used to make wood pulp to print new books.</p>
<h3>Emperor Announces to the People Yesterday: The Emperor is Not Sacred and Inviolable; Please Abandon the Illusion of Japanese Superiority</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, United Press, 1st] Emperor Hirohito issued an edict to the people on New Year's Day, saying: Japan has suffered a disastrous defeat after years of war, and the people inevitably feel uneasy and disappointed, which is of great concern to me. Drastic changes are taking place in the country, and the people's morality is deteriorating, resulting in a tendency for the people's thinking to fall into confusion. I stand with the people, sharing their joys and sorrows, and united on the basis of mutual trust and love, rather than on unfounded myths and legends. The Emperor is not sacred and inviolable, and the Japanese are not the most superior race in the world, born to rule the world. If the Japanese people can be strong and united, overcome the current difficulties, and enjoy civilized life in peace, then not only Japan, but the future of all mankind, will tend towards brightness. Emperor Meiji promulgated five oaths between 1868 and 1912, which were recorded in the constitution, stipulating that the Japanese people had the right to speak out in politics, guaranteeing that all people were treated equally, increasing the knowledge of the people, and making the empire more prosperous. The importance of these high-minded warnings need not be said, and I now wish to reiterate these oaths so that Japan can restore its independence. The principles contained in the oaths in the chapters must be observed, and we must move forward bravely, eliminate all past mistakes, earnestly understand the people's demands, and build a new Japan. The whole country, from top to bottom, will obtain a richer culture in peaceful years, and the level of the people will also be improved. I have decided to revive the five oaths enshrined in the Japanese Charter with an indomitable spirit: (1) Establish a parliament, and all government measures should be based on public opinion. (2) The whole country, from top to bottom, should unite together to actively promote national politics. (3) All the people of the country should be the same as the civil and military officials, and can realize their legitimate hopes, so as not to be dissatisfied. (4) Past statutes will still be observed, and all actions will be based on fairness and integrity. (5) Strive to increase the people's knowledge and status to promote the happiness of the empire.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Discusses the Control of Japan Again</h3>
<p>[Washington, United Press, 31st] US Secretary of State Byrnes told reporters today that General MacArthur did not know about the developments at the Moscow Conference. His views were obtained before the meeting of the three foreign ministers. Byrnes still praised MacArthur's administration, saying that the War Department and the State Department have reached a consensus on the method of governing Japan. He said that the British representative in Europe strongly advocated changing the policy of governing Japan, and said that the Soviet Union was not as serious in this regard as Australia. He insisted that he believed that the Moscow Agreement fully supported MacArthur's power. MacArthur has stated that he will seek to implement it, and Byrnes is confident that this plan can be implemented. When asked whether MacArthur's power includes the formation of policy, Byrnes said that the formation of policy is the responsibility of the president. Byrnes said that as far as he is concerned, if he does not discuss with MacArthur, who can provide "valuable advice," he does not intend to draft any plans.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Passes Three New Taxes</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, United Press, 1st] The "Mainichi Shimbun" reported today that the Japanese cabinet has passed draft bills for three new taxes, including a wartime excess profits tax, a private production increase tax, and a property tax, which will be submitted to MacArthur for approval. It is estimated that the revenue from these new taxes will be nearly US$5,000,000,000.</p>
<h3>Lawrence Broadcasts to Indians, Willing to Help India Achieve Autonomy; This Year Will Be a Test Period for India's New Life; Attlee Meets with British Delegation to India</h3>
<p>[London, Reuters, 1st] Indian Affairs Minister Lawrence broadcast to the Indians tonight, saying: "1946 will be a trial period in India's history. The British government and the British people sincerely want to see India quickly achieve complete freedom and become an equal member of the British Commonwealth. We will do our best to assist India to reach this status. There is no need to use criticism or organized pressure to gain recognition of India's rightful place in the world. This era is over. The current problem is a practical one, and a reasonable and acceptable plan of action must be formulated. According to this plan, power can be transferred to an Indian government supported by the Indian people, so that the new India will not be destroyed by civil strife and disputes again. For the welfare of India and the entire world, this is absolutely necessary. The new institutions of the world need strong members who contribute to peace, so internal coordination is a prerequisite."</p>
<p>[London, Reuters, 1st] Prime Minister Attlee met with Indian Affairs Minister Lawrence and the entire delegation of visiting Indian parliamentarians at the Prime Minister's residence yesterday. The delegation is scheduled to depart for India tomorrow. According to the head of the delegation, Lee, to reporters, this trip is purely a goodwill visit. We have no official positions. After returning this time, we do not intend to submit another report on the Indian issue. As a member of the Empire, we deeply wish to see the situation on the ground in India. All parties in Britain feel that the British government has a need to fulfill its promises to India. However, most of this problem is an internal problem. We should assist the Indian people with different views to seek a common solution.</p>

In this atomic age, if the fate of mankind is to be decided by peace and goodwill, then only the truth and non-violence theories proclaimed by Gandhi can achieve this goal. Among the humans fighting for peace in the world today, Gandhi is more powerful than any spokesperson of the great powers claiming to "love peace."

<h3>Zhejiang Province's Education Reform Plan: Director Xu Shaodi's Statement to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou] Xu Shaodi, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, has served for eleven years and has been particularly diligent during the eight years of the war. He recently told reporters about the future reform plan for education in Zhejiang Province in great detail. It is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>On the return trip to Hangzhou from Yunhe, the scars of war were everywhere, and many school buildings were severely damaged, causing great loss of vitality. It may take two or three years to restore the previous appearance. Although the war has ended, the continuous relocation of schools back to their original sites is still a refugee-style movement. While the enthusiasm of various parties to restore schools and the assistance given to schools by enthusiastic individuals are indeed present, the situations of certain unwarranted destruction and losses after the victory are too painful to speak of.</p>
<p>Lenient Handling of Screening</p>
<p>Furthermore, the regional distribution of schools has been adjusted during the war. This time, I originally intended to make an overall plan and distribution according to the original plan to make it more reasonable. Unfortunately, it is impossible to implement this across the board due to traditional concepts in various aspects. The local governments themselves will decide on the screening and assessment of teachers in the recovered areas. As for the reorganization of the student registers from the puppet schools, this should be done through examinations. Studying at schools run by the puppet government will inevitably be affected by the yoke of enslavement education. However, most young people seek education out of necessity due to their environment, which is different from defecting to the enemy. Screening should be handled leniently, and some should be given remedial education, after which they can be screened and assigned to various schools or transferred to other schools. Chairman Huang raised the slogan "Education First" after the victory of the war, but it goes without saying that national reconstruction depends on education.</p>
<p>Emphasis on Science Education</p>
<p>In this world war, victory and defeat were determined by science. A country with backward science, even if it has the name of a strong country, will not have the reality of a strong country. After Japan's surrender, it was said that Japan's defeat was a failure of science, and China's victory was a victory of diplomacy, which has profound meaning. There were many shortcomings in the past education system, which is undeniable. As for the decline in quality during the war, there were some natural factors at play. Most people's criticisms on this point are like scratching an itch from afar and not quite hitting the mark. There are many points that should be reformed in the future. Therefore, future education expansion plans are complex and cannot be explained in a few words. However, it can be asserted that we should attach importance to scientific research. Therefore, replenishing equipment, etc., is a matter of urgent need. Education is a century-long project of nurturing talents, and it cannot be done in a hurry. Even in terms of recovery, after eight years of destruction, it is not possible to achieve the goal of recovery overnight. The province's improvement plan should be implemented in stages.</p>
<p>This Year is Education Year</p>
<p>After Chairman Huang proposed that the 35th year of the Republic (1946) be the Education Year, it is planned to raise 300,000 dan of stored grain, with an additional 200,000 dan levied and 100,000 dan solicited to serve as a supplementary fund for educational undertakings, which will be continued annually. Most of this funding will be used to replenish equipment. School education should focus on quality over quantity. The Chairman's idea is that success in the century-long plan does not have to be by us alone, so the plan should be as far-reaching as possible. This is a long-term plan, and it is hoped that it can be implemented throughout.</p>
<p>Increase Teachers' Salaries</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to emphasize educational undertakings, teachers' salaries should be increased to be higher than those of civil servants. Also, because most outstanding young people are from poor families, equal educational opportunities should be provided, so we should find ways to provide them with subsidies so that they can pursue further studies. The Administrative Council has passed a resolution, and this Department can formulate implementation measures based on the principles outlined above. [Butterfly]</p>
<h3>Keep to the Right</h3>
<p>Elementary School Textbook Revisions</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Tianjin on the 1st] City vehicles are driving on the right side of the road today. The original "keep to the left" in the elementary school civic education materials has also been revised to "keep to the right."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education's Jiangsu-Anhui Supervision Office: Investigation of Loyalty in Education Circles</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Bengbu, Dahua News Agency] The Ministry of Education's Jiangsu-Anhui Supervision Office, in view of the fact that Jiangsu and Anhui bore the brunt of the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, fell into enemy hands early, and suffered deeply, believes that during this period, the education circles must have had people who generously rushed to their doom and calmly embraced martyrdom. These individuals are urgently in need of commendation to encourage righteousness. Therefore, a loyalty investigation form has been specially made, and party, government, and education agencies in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces are requested to instruct all counties to conduct thorough investigations so as to submit them to the Ministry of Education and request the National Government to issue commendations.</p>
<h3>Central Polytechnic Plans to Return to Nanjing: Building School Buildings Requires 3 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing via air, Dazhong News Agency] Since being approved to move back to Nanjing, the Central Polytechnic has convened a re-establishment committee to actively formulate a re-establishment plan with far-reaching and meticulous content, divided into three steps: relocation, replenishment, and expansion. Within one year, all current teachers and students can be moved back to Nanjing. Within five years, the eight departments of specialty and vocational departments, including machinery, civil engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, aviation, architecture, textile, and mining and metallurgy, can be fully completed. In the future, it is also planned to add an engineering college, attached junior high school and elementary school. If this plan is fully completed, it can become the most complete industrial school with three to four thousand students. However, the Nanjing school buildings of the school have been completely destroyed. This move back will require reconstruction. Engineers are currently drawing design plans, and the initial budget is 300 million yuan, which has been submitted to the Ministry of Education for review. Once approved, personnel will be sent to Beijing to start construction.</p>

<h3>Football League Opened Yesterday: Hequn and Korean Residents Each Draw</h3>
<p>No Score in the First Half</p>
<p>The new Shanghai Football League opened its prelude yesterday on New Year's Day. In the afternoon's inaugural Group A match, Hequn drew with Korean Residents 2-2. The Jiaozhou Concession situation was still considered enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Korean Residents, incarnated as Jilin, in addition to their tough style, yesterday had a performance of tacit understanding and skilled short passing. However, the shots lacked accuracy. In the first half, Hequn seemed to have forgotten to bring their "shooting shoes," resulting in a score of zero for both teams. Two minutes into the second half, Korean Residents had a good opportunity for a penalty kick, which was taken by center back Li Shidong, but it hit Yao Chong's chest, and the opportunity was lost. Nine minutes after the start of the second half, Xiao Ziwen opened the scoring with a low shot from 15 yards in front of the goal. In the 36th minute, Korean right forward Jin Wenxuan sprinted straight down, and Yao Chong rushed out too late, was lightly touched by Jin, and went diagonally into the lower left corner, making it 1-1. Four minutes later, Korean left forward Huang Chongchun intercepted the ball 20 yards out and sent a high left-footed shot that floated into the upper right corner. Yao was caught off guard, and Korean Residents took the lead 2-1. One minute later, Hequn counterattacked, reaching deep under the goal. Korean goalkeeper Hong Puzhi bounced the ball on the ground, and Xiao Ziwen took the opportunity to bump into it, leaking in from under his arm. Hequn gained this unexpected harvest and drew 2-2.</p>
<p>The results of yesterday's matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Hequn drew with Korean Residents (Group A) 2-2</p>
<p>Longjie defeated Yong'an (Group B) 4-0</p>
<p>Zhenru defeated Yong'an (Group C1) 2-1</p>

<h3>On the Interpretation of Freedom of Speech</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shizhao</p>
<p>This year marks the first year of the motherland's recovery. As we step into the ranks of powerful nations, with the resplendent banner of constitutional government, it is truly a grand occasion that the people of our nation will henceforth enjoy the rights of freedom. However, what is the meaning of freedom? What kind of enjoyment is it? From the government to the common people, there may not be a clear concept. Here, I would like to take freedom of speech as an example to explain it.</p>
<p>Our country's modern legal thought, flowing from Japan, originated from the Continent. The continental legal system distinguishes freedom and imposes various restrictions, which is different from the complete laissez-faire of the Anglo-American system. Our legal thinking has been immersed in the Continental system for a long time. Therefore, as soon as the Republic was established, press laws were written unexpectedly. In the first year of the Republic, the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Nanjing, with the current President of the Judicial Yuan as the Vice Minister, promulgated three articles of this law, which caused a great uproar in the Shanghai newspapers. At that time, I was writing for the Minli Bao, the organ of the Tongmenghui, and I also spoke based on Anglo-American law, saying:</p>
<p>"To truly understand freedom of the press in England, nothing is better than the words of Mansfield. Mansfield, as a famous judge, drew a line, saying: 'Freedom of the press is nothing else but the freedom to publish without seeking special permission in advance. Only when illegal events occur after publication can they be dealt with according to law.' Ellenborough, also a famous judge, also said: 'English law is the source of freedom. Freedom is named in contrast to special permission. The two words 'special permission' are actually useless in national law. If a person wants to publish, then publish it; there is no other operation. As for illegal acts, they must be judged, just like other illegal events, and there is nothing unique about publishing.' The words of the two families are like this. Those who slander press laws are not press laws. That which can be called a press law is nothing more than special permission, censorship, and security deposits. The press laws of the former Qing Dynasty had all three. Now the Ministry of Internal Affairs only marks the item of special permission. Looking at the constitution of England, it is entirely built on personal rights. Although this seems to be a special feature of the English constitution, in fact, the nature of the constitution should be like this. Why do I say this? If someone wants to write a book to his friend, this is an inherent freedom. If this person wants to publish his book for public viewing, this is also an inherent freedom. Furthermore, if this person wants to write good deeds to his friend every day, and wants to publish his book for public viewing every day, and increase the number to hundreds of millions of copies, this is also an inherent freedom. Why wait to ask? The former is called freedom of communication, and the latter is called freedom of publication. These two freedoms are not different things. If freedom of publication must be specially permitted, then why is freedom of communication unique? Extending this, if A wants to speak to B, this is his freedom; if B wants to speak to C and D, this is his freedom; this does not require special permission. If A wants to speak to B in a certain place, and B wants to speak to C and D in a certain place, if A and B want to speak to C and D together in a certain place, must they wait for special permission? The former is called freedom of speech, and the latter is called freedom of assembly. Knowing this principle, then it should be the inevitable order of freedom for A and B to speak to C, D, E, F, and even hundreds of millions of people, to speak together in a certain place every day, and to publish their common words in a certain place every day, up to hundreds of millions of copies. Why is that? That is freedom of the press. Professor Dicey, a famous figure in the English constitution, does not go beyond this."</p>
<p>I restate this passage with deep emotion. The three articles of the press law issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs at that time were extremely ordinary, only requiring publishers to register. However, in the early days of the Republic, the banner of freedom was suddenly raised. With a loud cry, the government retreated accordingly. In the end, the so-called three articles of the press law were withdrawn by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the matter was over. However, later, when Yuan Shikai was in power, and other Beiyang governments after him, all kinds of press restrictions were issued with increasing intensity. The National Government, under the name of tutelage, made this law even stricter, which everyone knows. Therefore, the country's speech, regardless of high or low, urgent or slow, large or small, light or heavy, has shrunk under layers of control. From the beginning to the end, it has become increasingly decadent. Who would say otherwise? However, since Nanjing established its authority, it has been more than thirty years, and the flower of freedom has bloomed and never withered. The so-called press laws have never been seen. May I ask, are the public and private discussions in our country far in line with the standards of the ancient sages, close to the virtues of the worthy officials, elegant and graceful in normal times, and generous and vigorous in times of change? Do they only express themselves when appropriate, and when they do, are they moderate, skillfully following the principles of the upper class, wise as measures, and clearly exhibiting their views without contradicting themselves? The passers-by can say definitively, no, no. Why not? It is because the gentlemen of today are not capable of advocating this kind of freedom.</p>
<p>Some may ask, this kind of freedom is what the new laws advocate. Is our old morality insufficient to cope with it? I say, no. The truth of the matter is that, considering time, space, and the ability to act, I only fear that old morality is not firm enough. Once it is firm, freedom will use it to enhance its use. Why worry about obstructing the law? Confucius said, "The way of the gentleman is rooted in himself, verified by the common people, examined by the Three Kings without error, established in heaven and earth without contradiction, questioned by ghosts and spirits without doubt, and waits for the sages of a hundred generations without confusion." This is the ultimate achievement of the ancient sages, which is the scope of freedom. Why do I say this? When people are first born, they are ignorant and primitive. They speak when they want to speak, and say what they want to say, without any so-called education or etiquette. After education and etiquette arise, they begin to know that the speaker is for himself, and the listener is for others. Acting directly according to one's feelings has its inconveniences. This is the state of the individual and the common people in the Doctrine of the Mean. Going further than this, the realm of ghosts and spirits, the brightness of heaven and earth, the past of the Three Kings, and the future of the sages of a hundred generations, must all be extended from oneself and the common people to the fullest extent, in order to seek harmony with each other. Talking about this is called freedom, but in fact it is extremely unfree. Sages are representatives who can accommodate themselves in extreme unfreedom, with room to spare. In the history of mankind, there are only a few sages, and therefore there are only a few who truly understand freedom. What does the country rely on to place this freedom that is hoped for but cannot be immediately achieved? I say, no. The principle is one, but there are differences in degree, importance, and weight. Speaking of the extreme, there are things that even sages cannot do. Speaking in general, even the foolish and the ignorant can understand. The sage even more earnestly and clearly established the meaning for the ignorant masses, saying: "Is there one word that can be practiced for a lifetime? It is tolerance!" Tolerance is like one's heart. In fact, it is nothing more than using one's own heart to measure the hearts of others. Holding this to regulate freedom will allow you to move forward without obstruction. Standing in heaven and earth, wanting to be called upright, although wisdom and ability are said to be unequal, making it difficult to understand the intricacies, it is still possible to clearly point out the differences between oneself and others. It is hard to believe that people do not know how to explain the word "tolerance." Therefore, common people say that old morality is not suitable for new freedom. There is no such thing.</p>
<p>As for the meaning of new morality in relation to freedom, it is even more open. An English proverb says: "Freedom is freedom, but it should be bounded by the freedom of others." Raising the word "boundary" is consistent with the Confucius's discussion of oneself and others, and even ghosts, spirits, heaven, earth, the Three Kings, and the sages of a hundred generations. In the past, Mill wrote a book on freedom, whose meaning was extremely clear. Yan Jidao translated it as "The Limits of Individual and Social Authority." Although it is not without the loss of meaning in making a name, it is still a satisfactory and valuable title. To say that the people of our country are not able to enjoy freedom is no different from saying that the people of our country do not know what those boundaries are. Gentlemen, ask yourselves, what do you think?</p>
<p>I have said that the government's restriction of freedom, in the end, there are still some unrestricted areas. Use them well, and there may still be room for manoeuvre. Why do I say this? When the government does not restrict, I will secretly set up various obstacles to encourage myself. Now, what the government has set up is only ink rules. Although the former is also a restriction and the latter is also a restriction, their scope may not necessarily overlap. Even if my freedom is extremely pure, it must still enter and exit through layers of inspection. The question is, what kind of inspection do the people of the country want to preserve, and what kind do they want to eliminate? Also, what kind of inspection does the government want to uphold, and what kind does it want to allow to be released?</p>
<p>Being timid in public battles and brave in private fights is the inferiority of the national character. Restraining speech will lead to laziness in advocating and diligence in attacking, which corresponds to this. Moreover, the intensity of the attack depends on the strength of the opposing force. Those who are reckless and see no future consequences will use force violently. This is to wipe out justice and only target people to vent personal anger. It is truly the worst of the worst, difficult to sort out. In a word, it is the lack of clarity between public and private, and the lack of standards in speech.</p>
<p>As for the effect of tutelage, it has nothing to do with freedom. Tutelage is the technique of Mozi's advocating of conformity. Mozi said: "What the superior affirms, all must affirm; what the superior denies, all must deny. Praising those who conform to the superior and do not compare with the inferior is what the superior rewards and the inferior praises. Abandoning bad speech and learning the good speech of the ruler; abandoning bad deeds and learning the good deeds of the ruler. How can we understand the governance of the state? It is because the ruler can unify the meaning of the state, and therefore the state is governed." This is the ultimate goal of tutelage. Those who specialize in the organs of propaganda are focused on this. As for freedom, it is the opposite. Freedom is what gives rise to differences. I once wrote a "Theory of the Basis of Politics," which began by stating: "There is a basis for politics. Where is the basis? I say, it lies in tolerance. What is tolerance? I say, it is not liking conformity and disliking difference." This is not my personal opinion. Walter Bagehot once valued the fierce debate in Parliament, saying that English politics first takes the evaluation of politics as politics. The government party is called the King's Servant in political terminology, and the opposition party is called the King's Opposition Party. Taking the King as the target and focusing the arrows on him makes the King the focal point of the world. This not only violates the principle of conformity advocated by Mozi, but also rebels against the principle that the monarch cannot do evil. Therefore, when this statement first came out, the world was quite shocked, but the British eventually adopted it as law and achieved the highest principle. May said: "The virtue of a political party lies first in listening to the opinions of the opposition party." Mill said: "The use of the two parties is that one is necessary for the existence of the other because the other is insufficient. Its benefit to the country lies in the fact that they attack each other and do not agree, which can restrain the power of the acting rulers and make them always follow reason and be aware." This is how the British make good use of their freedom. In a word, it is the five characters I wrote in my article: "Not liking conformity and disliking difference."</p>
<p>Today, people talk about politics and like to promote England and America, but we are only imitating them with heart. Freedom is one of its main points, but freedom cannot come without a reason, nor can it be obtained by simply opening one's mouth. I used to hold Dicey's saying, deeply fearing that it would give people a sense of ease. Now, please let me use Bagehot's words to refute it.</p>
<p>"Judging by civilization, even our England is quite remarkable, but among them, there are many people whose knowledge is no different from that of the majority two thousand years ago, and the others who are better are no better than the so-called outstanding talents of a thousand years ago. Otherwise, how can there be so many people in the lower and middle classes of society who are narrow-minded, stubborn, and numb! Do those who hear this doubt my words? Then try to return to your home, go to your kitchen, and speak to the cooking woman or the chef, using the principles that you think are the clearest, most fluent, and most certain, but they think are obscure, incomprehensible, and absurd. If what you have gained from delving into the depths, now only speak of the most accessible to the people, but they think is far-fetched, wild, and heretical, then my saying is not false. It must be known that a large group is like a large mountain, whose substance has many layers. Only the group's transformation also has it, and the characteristics of its lower layer are closer to the ancient times than to the upper layer. Therefore, political thinkers who do not take the differences of the several layers, hanging them on the right seat, and examining them from time to time, their arguments will inevitably lead to thorough mistakes, and it is like using brocade to cover traps, and many people will fall into them."</p>
<p>How do we view England decades ago? The freedom that cannot be expected to be achieved suddenly is as clear as ten suns shining together, and the government cannot shirk its responsibility for careful nurturing. The question of similarities and differences between moving from tutelage to promulgation of a constitution is like a deep pit and a great valley that cannot be connected. If we rely on the old strategies of propaganda, and suddenly hope for the enlightenment of public opinion and the assistance of national affairs, it is no different from lying down and licking the sky. In the future, the constitutional crisis will not be just one or two. It is hoped that the wise men of the government and the public will carefully observe the difference between the group and the individual, and distinguish and practice with a public heart and sincerity, so that they can advance inch by inch and not retreat foot by foot.</p>

<h3>Yang Wendao's Ten Years in Prison: Appeals for Redress of Injustice; Sentenced to Death Under Enemy Authority</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison, there is a patriotic prisoner who has been sentenced to death and has already spent ten years there. He is praying that in this time of renewed light, he can have his unjust sentence overturned and walk peacefully out of the iron gates of that gray building.</p>
<p>**Forced Confession, Unable to Express Grievances**</p>
<p>This case is the famous "Nakayama Hideo Case." The prisoner who has been imprisoned for ten years is named Yang Wendao, the eldest son of Yang Hanxiao from Zhongshan, Guangdong. This handsome 28-year-old youth came to our office hoping to appeal for justice for his father. He said that from the beginning, the entire Shanghai press corps, and even the judges involved in the trial, knew that the Japanese were plotting and scheming to create an incident, and therefore deliberately fabricated a major case. Japanese detectives tortured Yang Wendao in the police station for two months, forcing him to confess that he was instructed by our superiors to assassinate Nakayama Hideo. But Yang Wendao, deeply understanding the greater good, remained unyielding. When the trial came, the Japanese deployed armored vehicles and heavily armed soldiers at the entrance of the court, creating an extremely tense situation. Yang Wendao was eventually sentenced to death under the enemy's duress. While he was still appealing to the Supreme Court, the War of Resistance broke out, the government moved inland, and he was left in Shanghai Prison awaiting sentencing until now. It has been ten years since he was arrested.</p>
<p>**Appealing for Rescue in the Renewed Light**</p>
<p>After Yang Wendao was arrested, his family was in dire straits. His wife, Yang Tang, had to send her two youngest children to an orphanage, and another child wandered to the inland. Initially, relatives and friends provided some assistance, but when the war started, their residence on Tangshan Road was completely burned down. After the Japanese occupied Shanghai, even relatives and friends who were willing to help were afraid to provide assistance to avoid suspicion. For ten years, they endured the pain of family ruin and death. Now that the light has returned, they immediately began to rescue this old prisoner as soon as the government took over various Shanghai institutions in September. They submitted petitions to the Third War Area Command, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Relief Association for Comrades Who Suffered Hardship, the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai... Finally, on December 21, they mailed a petition to Nanjing, seeking help from Chairman Chiang. According to President Cha Liangjian of the District Court, he has already submitted a request for instructions to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. However, the family feels that the past ten years aside, the lack of news in recent months after the victory is making them somewhat anxious. They are making efforts in many ways, requesting people from all walks of life to uphold justice and overturn this unjust conviction.</p>
<h3>Three More Foreign War Criminals Captured</h3>
<p>The Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters recently arrested three more foreign war criminals who aided the enemy: one is a Hungarian named Xiboke, who was a lackey of Colonel Nakamura, the head of the Shanghai branch of the Japanese Black Dragon Society. Xiboke set up a company to purchase military supplies for the enemy. The other two are Portuguese, one named Leimidis, born in Macau, with a Portuguese father and a Japanese mother. During the Japanese occupation, he changed to his mother's surname, calling himself Nakamura Leimidis, claiming to be Japanese and bullying Chinese people. Leimidis was also Xiboke's assistant, helping the Japanese military purchase supplies and making significant contributions. The other one, Xueerweiya, was also Xiboke's assistant. They relied on the power of the Japanese military to arbitrarily arrest people and imprison them in their private institutions, using torture. Many victims have reported them to the Garrison Headquarters. The Inspection Office arrested these three foreign rogues a few days ago, and it is reported that they will be sent to the court within days to be prosecuted for war crimes.</p>
<h3>Over 14,000 Cases of Registered Enemy Crimes; All Perpetrators Detained Awaiting Trial</h3>
<p>The investigation of enemy crimes, which the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office was ordered to handle, started on November 6, 1945, and as of December 31, 1945, 14,528 cases have been registered. From January 1, 1946, to February 17, excluding holidays, over 27,600 registration numbers have been issued. The office originally planned to conclude this work in January, but is now forced to continue due to the situation.</p>
<p>**Japanese Military Police Who Committed Crimes Will Not Be Allowed to Return Home**</p>
<p>Furthermore, the personnel in charge of handling these cases found that among the cases occurring in the Shanghai urban area, the perpetrators were mostly Japanese military police. Therefore, they have consulted with the 23rd Regiment of the National Army Military Police in this city and agreed that the office will transfer the list of perpetrators to the regiment to cross-reference with the Japanese former Shanghai military police captured and managed by the regiment. Those identified will not be allowed to return home, for future trial needs. It is also learned that the Port Transportation Command of the Third War Area Command has also sent a letter to the office requesting the transfer of the list of perpetrators to detain them when sending Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese residents back to their country. It is reported that the office has registered a large number of victims from the countryside, and it is difficult to provide complete names for the Japanese robbers and murderers. The office has discussed with the Port Transportation Command to detain the Japanese senior military officers who allowed their subordinates to do evil in the last batch returning to their country for trial.</p>
<p>**High Court Prosecutor's Office Investigates Collaborationist Cases**</p>
<p>As of the end of 1945, the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office has received 77 cases of collaborators transferred to the office by military and police agencies in this city. Among them, some have already been prosecuted, and the rest are under investigation.</p>

<h3>The Full Picture of Shanghai's Municipal Administration (Continued) The Bureau of Public Works Bears a Heavy Responsibility for Construction</h3>
<p>—Our Newspaper's Interview Room—</p>
<p>As we are in the early days of victory, and municipal facilities face countless challenges and arduous work, in order to understand the progress of the city's administration in the past three months, this newspaper has interviewed the municipal government and its various bureaus and units to provide a systematic report. In addition to the general overview of the Municipal Government, Bureau of Finance, Bureau of Social Affairs, Bureau of Public Utilities, Bureau of Education, Bureau of Land Administration, Bureau of Health, Police Bureau, and Department of Civil Affairs, which have been published in the New Year's Day supplement, there is also a report from the Bureau of Public Works. Due to space constraints, it could not be published at the same time. We deeply apologize for this, and now specially publish it here for the readers' understanding.</p>
<p>Shanghai, after experiencing the ravages of war and the trampling of the enemy and puppets, has suffered enormous losses in the past eight years. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the most important task for the country is construction. And the Bureau of Public Works bears the heaviest responsibility for the construction of a great Shanghai.</p>
<p>Zhao Zukang, Director of the Bureau of Public Works, is from Songjiang, Jiangsu Province. He is currently 46 years old and holds a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Civil Engineering from Tangshan Jiaotong University. Later, he was sent by the Ministry of Railways to study at Cornell University in the United States. After returning to China, he successively served as Director of the Wuzhou Bureau of Public Works, Deputy Director of the Highway Department of the National Economic Council, Acting Director, Director of the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, Director of the Engineering Department of the Transportation Control Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, Deputy Director of the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, member of the Phi Tau Phi Honorary Society, member of the International Road Association, and Vice President of the National Engineering Society. Recently, he was elected as the President of the Shanghai Branch of the Society.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works took over the "Construction Bureau" of the puppet organization on September 12, 1945. After the takeover, the work was extremely intense, and the tasks were made even more difficult due to the destruction by the enemy and puppets. The total length of roads in Shanghai is 700,000 meters, and the road surface needing repair reaches 340,000 square meters. Currently, over 70,000 square meters have been repaired. There are 230 bridges in Shanghai, all of which need repair. All 500,000 meters of ditches in Shanghai need to be dredged, and only 45,000 meters, or one-tenth, have been repaired so far. If the material problem can be solved, the progress of the project can be accelerated in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, more than 80 wharves in Shanghai urgently need to be repaired, and 15,000 cubic feet of mud have accumulated in the ditches, which must be removed immediately. The bureau plans to carry out the work actively during the winter when the water is cold and the soil is solidified, so that the flood damage can be reduced during the rainy season.</p>
<p>The reporter asked Mr. Zhao whether the pre-war city center construction plan would be continued as before. Mr. Zhao replied that at present, the entire Shanghai is being targeted for construction, so it is much larger than the original city center construction plan. The reporter then asked how long the major construction would take. Mr. Zhao said that road maintenance engineering cannot be limited by time. If we are talking about repairs, after eight years of destruction, it is impossible to complete in a few months.</p>
<p>The current work to be done by the Bureau of Public Works is: (1) road maintenance, including the repair and renovation of bridges, wharves, flood control buildings, all public buildings, and parks; (2) dredging all rivers; (3) dredging of ditches and sewage pipes, and repair of rainwater pumping stations. Director Zhao expressed concern for the parks, saying that Shanghai has a large population, many factories, and the air is quite polluted. The citizens' mental and physical health are not comfortable, so he plans to focus more on parks to improve the health of the citizens. He also plans to build single-story affordable and ordinary housing near the city's factory areas to solve the city's housing problem.</p>
<p>As for the suburban highways, the highways leading to Longhua, Minhang, Caohejing, Hongqiao, and Wusong have already been repaired. The Pudong Avenue in Pudong has also started to be repaired. The highways in the city center were almost completely destroyed after the August 13th Incident, and are now being actively repaired.</p>
<p>The iron gates leading to Nanshi have been removed and will be completely dismantled by the end of 1945 to facilitate traffic. All road names are gradually being changed, and a complete list of new road names has been published. It is expected that the renaming will be implemented on New Year's Day, 1946.

<h3>Trade Associations to Handle Industrial and Commercial Registration</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Since the implementation of industrial and commercial registration in this city, there is a deadline for obtaining and filling out forms. However, the level of knowledge in various industries is uneven, and they do not fully understand the filling procedures, causing them to travel back and forth, which is very inconvenient. In order to reduce the difficulties of the members, the dyeing and weaving industry, fresh meat industry, letterpress printing industry, and hot water store industry associations have successively submitted requests to the Bureau of Social Affairs, requesting permission to purchase and collect forms from the bureau at a price, and handle all filling procedures on behalf of the members. It is reported that the bureau has approved the request, but it is still necessary to handle it in stages according to the areas specified by the bureau to maintain uniformity.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Gold and US Dollars</h3>
<p>Some time ago, there were speculations about the new exchange rate in the newspapers, leading to a variety of reports. As a result, the speculative market, with its shallow understanding, was sometimes bullish and sometimes bearish, busy for a while, but in the end, the old price of over 800,000 yuan remained unchanged. Ordinary retail investors, worrying themselves needlessly, rushed around and bumped their noses, gradually becoming indifferent to the gold market. Recently, everyone has been concentrating on US dollars, with the general mentality of wanting to go from 600 yuan per 10 taels of US dollars to around 500. This is based on the US black market gold price returning to as low as $57 per ounce, which is consistent with the year-end gold market and the closing price of US dollars. It is found that the official US gold purchase price is $35 per ounce. During the war, the black market once soared to over $80. After the war ended, it hovered around $60 per ounce for a long time, which is equivalent to a little more than one tael in the market. Therefore, the accompanying city market is based on 600 per 10 taels. Since this city has abandoned gold in favor of dollars, in other words, the sentiment for US dollars is stronger than for gold. However, gold is constrained by the Chongqing listing price, and coupled with the popularity of stocks, the original 10 taels of gold could get 2,000 shares of Wing On or Mei Ah, which has recently shrunk to 930 shares of Wing On. The floating capital after profiting from stocks will inevitably come to replenish gold, and at that time, gold will definitely not be abandoned. It can be said that unless the US black market gold price drops again, or China re-establishes the gold price, it will be difficult for those who sell gold to buy dollars to achieve their expected goals, because $35 per ounce is the official purchase price set by the US Treasury Department, not the selling price. The country's price index is also much higher than when the gold price was set, and members of Congress have also advocated raising the gold price. In addition, China's gold listing price is based on the initial issuance price of 50,000 yuan per tael, plus a 40% contribution, and will not be changed in the short term. In this reporter's humble opinion, the authorities may not have an appropriate decision on the entire foreign exchange policy after the victory. Just look at the huge price differences between Chongqing, North China, and Shanghai, and the fact that Taiwan and the Eastern Nine Provinces each issued circulation vouchers, which is very obvious. Although gold is not as flexible as US dollars, it is often used as a bargaining chip for large transactions and will not be too far apart from US dollars. The speculative market in the future will inevitably form a long-term seesaw battle. (Qin)</p>
<h3>Lake Silk and Tung Oil Exported to the US Today from Shanghai</h3>
<p>The US-China shipping route is very busy. Most of the imported goods are items from relief agencies, such as wheat, flour, cotton clothing, and old clothes and shoes. The most common commodities are canned foods such as foreign wine, milk, and White Pagoda, and the cotton textiles are also shipped for relief, including 200 boxes of flannel. There are no formal commodity imports. For the export of Lake silk and tung oil, there were two previous shipments to the United States. Today, the President Company's ship, Capaison Den, has another 300 pieces of Lake silk, 300 pieces of tung oil, fur, hog bristles, etc., totaling five to six hundred tons, departing for the United States.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Continue to Establish Trade Associations</h3>

These were submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for review. Furthermore, the Water Pipe Business, Fireworks Industry, Used Western Clothing Industry, Lard Industry, and Tea Snack Wholesale Industry should each establish separate associations, which are also under review by the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Xu Congde and others requested to establish a Electroplating Industry Association, and Shao Rongquan and others requested to establish a Chinese-style Wood Furniture Industry Association. Both were approved to begin preparations.</p>
<p>More than a dozen sets of new, high-capacity power generation equipment delivered to China under the U.S. Lend-Lease Act were accepted in New York in late last month and will soon be shipped to China. The government has decided to allocate them for installation in various regions.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Social Affairs issued a telegram ordering that all properties of enemy and puppet organizations in recovered areas should be taken over by people's organizations approved by the Ministry, after being reported and transferred by the social administration authorities of each province and city.</p>
<p>Before the current laws are revised, all registration fees for companies will be charged at ten times the original amount.</p>
<p>Due to the slower business in December, the city's banquet tax will be collected at 45% of the November turnover. The total amount is over 38.81 million yuan, which will be distributed proportionally among 95 companies in the industry. In principle, 20% of the previous month's turnover will be collected sequentially for subsequent months, without any further discounts.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, Shanghai Yumin Woolen Mill has suspended operations due to the lack of raw materials. It is now actively preparing to resume operations. The factory previously produced Canqiu brand coarse wool and Double Hands brand fine wool.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Hope</h3>
<p>— Lu Mang</p>
<p>"Hope" is like a bud, preparing to grow and blossom. The warm sunlight, the glistening morning dew, even the subtle mist and the gentle spring breeze are hope's dearest friends. Accompanying it, embracing it, hoping for its accomplishment.</p>
<p>The "imagination" of "hope" is the flower after the bud. We imagine the flower completed by the bud to be so beautiful and fragrant! Therefore, our "imagination" of hope is so perfect and wonderful!</p>
<p>But when hope is about to be realized, that is, when the imagination of hope is about to cease to be imagination, a sudden change occurs. Just as a bud is about to bloom, a sudden gust of wind and rain causes the bud to stiffen. How disappointing this is!</p>
<p>"Hope" is also like a "crescent moon." Children look forward to it making up for its imperfections, poets pray for it to increase in splendor, and lovers cherish it even more, preparing to spend the whole night on the lake or by the sea. However, on the day of reunion, dark clouds suddenly appear on the horizon!</p>
<p>This is more incomplete than before the imperfection was made up; the increased splendor turns to darkness!</p>
<p>"Hope" is also like a blade of grass, a blade of grass by the roadside, flourishing when suddenly a large leather shoe tramples it, withering in an instant. In reality, it has not even reached summer, let alone autumn.</p>
<p>But if we look a little bigger, a little further, if this bud falls, there will be another; if this month's bright moon does not see reunion, there will be another month. Even if this year's grass withers, there will be next year. Wildfires cannot burn them out; the spring breeze blows and they grow again. We all have a future.</p>
<p>Now is the time for us to generate hope again. Naturally, we are not discouraged. We still hope, still imagine, and our imagination of hope is not only still the outline of past imagination, but even more expanded and beautiful!</p>
<h3>Medicine for Rejuvenation</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Every New Year, my heart is troubled! First: I don’t have much spare money to deal with this holiday, "trouble"; Second: I have been drifting outside for a long time, missing my relatives but unable to reunite, "trouble"; Third: The editors are forcing me to embellish the "New Year" manuscripts, but I have no literary inspiration, "trouble".</p>
<p>Especially this year! It is said that we have won; the national life should be a little better; but prices continue to soar; making you still under high pressure, enduring embarrassing difficulties. It is said that we have won; the common people should be able to triumphantly return to their hometowns; live and work in peace; but "transportation is difficult"; making you still "unable to return home"! It is said that we have won; finally, we have recovered a life from the gunfire, which should be worthy of celebration; worthy of comfort, something to tell; something to write; but there are too many problems in the national situation, making you still depressed, suffocated; you want to speak but have no voice; you want to cry but have no tears; you can't write anything; so you deeply feel that living is not as good as dying!</p>
<p>It is not that I want to be overly pessimistic. In fact, the country is seriously ill. As a citizen of the country, "pain and itching are related." I ask: who can bear it? Who can laugh?</p>
<p>People get sick because they have to work hard to make a living; over time, their bodies become unhealthy, and overwork leads to illness. Moreover, because they have no money for treatment, they become increasingly serious. If it is allowed to develop, there is only death! For the same reason, the country's illness is caused by political problems. The situation cannot be stabilized, and because there is no good way to guide it into submission, crises are everywhere. If it is allowed to develop, it is really unthinkable!</p>
<p>A person's unhealthy body is "illness"; a country's disorder is "illness"; a person without money is "poverty"; a country's mismatched politics is "poverty". Illness comes from poverty, and then illness after poverty; the poorer, the sicker; the sicker, the poorer! Just like: "National disorder" is due to "mismatched politics."</p>
<p>Illness is divided into yin and yang, "yin" lurking inside, "yang" forming outside. The progression of illness is mostly first yin and then yang; that is, it first spreads slowly inside, and then gradually develops outwards; this can also be called from light to heavy. The reason for this is, of course, partly due to the influence of poverty, and partly due to the psychology of patients who generally "hide their illness and avoid doctors". Patients are ashamed of "illness"; they never admit when they are sick; they never tell the doctor the truth about their condition; when the illness is terminal, although they instinctively fear death; it is too late to rescue! If they paid attention early; strengthened prevention; and stopped its development; then what is the point of illness? Moreover, "prevention" and "stopping" methods do not necessarily have to be medicine; "spiritual recuperation" is the best method of prevention and stopping the initial onset of illness. After the illness is serious, as long as the patient can "rein in at the edge of the cliff", he can still turn danger into safety! This requires the patient to eliminate the psychology of "hiding illness and avoiding doctors", and truthfully tell the doctor about the condition, so that the "right medicine can be prescribed". They should also absolutely follow the doctor's orders, so that the treatment of sores is effective and the resurrection is possible! Human illness is like this, and national illness is also like this.</p>
<p>If a country wants to be strong, it must have no disorder; and to quell disorder, politics must be in harmony. How to make politics in harmony? There must be good strategies. Political harmony is the country's capital; good strategies are the country's doctors.</p>
<p>China has been walking a path of bad luck, suffering from internal and surgical diseases for decades. Because of "illness" and "hiding illness and avoiding doctors", it has lingered to this day without recovery. Although the surgical symptoms are now cured, the medical symptoms are still spreading. It is like a person suffering from a high fever, and using a strong cold medicine will cause idiocy, so warm and cool medicine should be used. China wants to cure disorder, it must never use force, but should adopt a good strategy and achieve a peaceful solution! "Democracy" is enough to eliminate germs, and "peace" is enough to restore health! Democracy is like China's good doctor, and peace is like China's special medicine! "Good doctors" can make "special medicines"; special medicines can cure diseases.</p>
<p>People who are sick all hope that spring will turn better. Now I wish China a good turn in the spring of 1946! We now have excellent doctors. We only need to sincerely invite him to give us a "peace remedy." This "peace remedy" is the medicine for rejuvenation! It is guaranteed that the medicine will cure the disease, and China will be healthy from now on, and it will also be eternally strong from now on!</p>
<p>Peace is not only China's medicine for rejuvenation, but also the world's and all mankind's "medicine for rejuvenation"!</p>
<p>I am eagerly waiting for the New Year of 1947 here. I hope that I have already returned home by then; I hope that my father is sitting beside me. I happily and quietly write songs praising "New Year" again, and then, I will respectfully send it to the editor's door!</p>
<h3>Old Friend</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>On a cold, desolate, and bleak road, someone suddenly rode past on a white horse. Because of the white color of the horse's coat, I couldn't help but recall the tragic incident in which my old friend Yang Xingzhi died in a car accident in Baima during his journey through Sichuan and Hubei.</p>
<p>Yang Xingzhi was a young man who was loyal to his duties, enthusiastic in his treatment of others, and had a promising future. Ten years ago, he worked at the Shen Bao. When the war of resistance against Japan broke out, he resolutely followed me.</p>
<p>I remember when I was the editor-in-chief of the Yijing Literature and History Biweekly, he wrote many rare and anecdotal accounts of the war from the army. In particular, Qiu Bai's final words, "Superfluous Words," were also sent to me by him for publication. Many publications had tried in various ways to find this manuscript without success, but he actually sent the entire manuscript and added a very detailed narrative before the text, giving readers a clear reference.</p>
<p>When the "August 13th" Shanghai battle broke out, he followed the army to Shishan to resist the war. In the midst of his busy military affairs, he took the time to visit me on Avenue Joffre. In war-torn Shanghai, being able to shake hands and talk with an old friend was a source of indescribable joy. I took him to visit the Tianchan Refugee Shelter, which I and several comrades had established. We talked freely about our lifelong ambitions, the future of the war of resistance, and the eventual defeat of the Japanese pirates, and our wills were exceptionally aligned.</p>
<p>On two occasions, he specially invited me to take a car to the front lines to actually observe the war. We ate bread and drank boiled water with the brave soldiers in the trenches. When enemy planes bombed the positions, we huddled at the bottom of the fortifications with the soldiers. The most dangerous time was at half past twelve in the middle of the night, when we drove to the front in a car that could not turn on its lights in that environment. Suddenly, there was a flash of light and a loud bang. An enemy shell broke a large tree, and the trunk fell directly on the hood of the car, causing the car to shake violently and stop. The driver and the guards got out of the car and used a lot of effort to move the branches away before they could start the car again. Less than two minutes later, enemy shells rained down on the road our car was traveling on in rapid succession. A stone stele in a graveyard by the road was broken by a stray shell and landed next to the car. The body of the car was damaged, and the right rear tire was punctured. The car was parked on the dark road, relying only on the sporadic light of a flashlight to change the tire. It took half an hour to repair it hastily.</p>
<p>When the fighting in Shanghai was intense, he often came to the special zone on official business and always made sure to stop by my residence for a chat. Battalion Commander Yao Ziqing and his entire battalion of soldiers died in Luodian, and they were from the same unit. He described the battle vividly.</p>
<p>Once, I saw him interrogating spies in a dilapidated temple in the front lines. He used many methods to question them, making it impossible for the spies to argue. Although they reluctantly said some vague words, it further proved the falsity of their strained and exhausted efforts, and they finally confessed their crimes. He said that he was originally a writer, usually engaged in literary pursuits. Now, participating in the great war of national resistance against foreign aggression, he had seen, heard, and experienced many things. In the future, compiling them into a book would also be very meaningful. Every time he saw me, he would say, "I've gained a lot of war material again." I strongly encouraged him to complete this masterpiece full of historical authenticity.</p>
<p>It is said that after he died in a car accident in 1940, his remains were hastily buried on a hill near Baima. The whereabouts of his widow and orphans are now unknown. His commander at the time told his subordinates that after the war ended, Xingzhi's remains would be moved and buried at Jieshan. Now, as the ten thousand trees wither and the north wind howls, I am filled with indescribable emotion as I remember my old friend in life and death. The Japanese invaders have been overthrown. I think Xingzhi's spirit in heaven should be able to rest in peace.</p>
<h3>Fog</h3>
<p>— Li Fu</p>
<p>For the past few days, the misty fog has been really annoying. When there is no fog, the clear sky in the morning, the earth under the bright sun, and the setting sun on the willow branches in this corner of the small building are like a close-up shot, unfolding so poetically and spiritually in the east and west windows. Although I am not a poet or a painter, and I cannot think of a beautiful line of poetry or paint a picture in the scenery, I can indeed feel a comfortable intoxication and new satisfaction from the silent prospect. Rather than saying that this is a leisurely mood, it is more appropriate to say that the body and mind that are tired of life, especially for the leisurely and relaxed environment, need and feel the state of things deeply. Therefore, the feelings given to me by the thick fog these days are particularly turbid and dull, like suddenly covering a layer of white buffer in front of the eyes, a hazy expanse, unable to distinguish direction, height, width, even breathing also has an unnatural feeling, as if isolated from the world. So, I couldn't help but hate the fog, even curse the fog, because it couldn't let me express the accumulated emotions in my chest.</p>
<p>People always love to have a bright world that is sufficient for free galloping and activity. Although the fog does not hinder me or restrict my activities in personnel affairs, it does have an invisible and silent magic power, dimming my heart; dimming my eyes, making me feel like I am falling into a turbid sea with spraying water foam, that is, the biggest plane, ship, no matter how big its boldness, it cannot be used freely. Although there are still fixed routes in the sky and sea in the fog. Although the fog will not turn the universe into a black shadow, it has withdrawn a group of bottomless turbidity and haze from the universe.</p>
<p>I remember once at sea, when the wheel encountered a heavy fog, it was midnight, the sky was full of mist, and it covered the sea densely, the light mark of the lighthouse was covered, and the four were an endless darkness, the humid sea breeze was as cold as the Arctic Ocean, and it blew people to shiver, the sea waves hit the ship's hull and sent out angry Hanxi, the warning whistle of the far lighthouse, passed through the sea surface of the foggy night, stretched, from high to weak, like a beast, sadly and coldly dispersing on the foggy sea surface, The whistle on the wheel also whimpered and attached to it, followed by a tight bell ringing intermittently, a kind of terrifying and tense air, almost making people wonder if the ship had encountered danger. In this way, I spent the night in the terrifying alarm whistle and the chaotic bells, until the fog dissipated the next day, and then the atmosphere shrouded in Qi was lifted, and the wheel was able to identify the direction and move forward. The frightening image that "fog" gave me that time was too deep, but I can more thoroughly appreciate that only quiet and patient observation can overcome difficulties - fog.</p>
<h3>Surrender Song</h3>
<p>— Jiang Suxuan</p>
<p>On September 2, 34th year, my General Xu Yongchang was ordered to stand guard at the allied state's American Missouri to receive Japan's surrender. On the 9th, Admiral He received the surrender in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Dark clouds and enemy flags fall, dragon battle whale slaughter shark cave apprentices, coral shattered 　 net collected, Chishui beads return like the joy of ignorance, warship teams thin Fu case, Mount Fuji covers its head and snow flows down, thousands of needles broken ten thousand bone ashes, one hundred and twenty generations of hegemony destroyed, small bullets strictly limit the old territories, so that fishermen are out of order and reasoning is unclear, surrender king avoids details and takes title of abundance, the middle court sends envoys to wield their festivals, before Xu went far to colonize the race, after Xu asked the sin of Zhongtian Xian, the divine land was bitterly trampled by iron cavalry, heavy completion understands the will of heaven, Surrender city is built with sixteen paths, six masters drive the wind and insert their wings, the stone city of Yu area has been desolate for a long time with smoke and water, the coiled dragon and tiger spirit is reborn, the lofty general points to the cast spear, the culprit willingly pays the punishment, the resentment and poison of hundreds of millions of people have not been fully repaid, generosity turns to teach righteousness, a true man Yue descends to relieve national difficulties, bell humble inscription Qing Shi books, forces water and fire to ascend the seat, take the opportunity to Kangji struggle for a moment, wait and see both inside and outside, Home Ren bumps into the destruction of the ambition, the rest of his life but pray to complete the drinking, a few boiling blood smell Chong call.</p>
<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>— Wan Qing</p>
<p>Although the weather is not cold, the season has arrived, and the roads are full of drifting fallen leaves. Poor children are picking them up carefully, one leaf and one collection, fearing that if they crowd each other, they will become the end, crushed into powder, and there will be no flames when they burn. In previous years, firewood was not considered anything, who would still bend down to pick up fallen leaves. This year, firewood is too expensive, so how can you not pick up fallen leaves! So, basket after basket, bag after bag, they drifted back with people. In poor families, the fire is lit in the stove, and blue smoke fills the room, but the rice is cooked, and both the cook and the diners are shedding tears. Although they are shedding tears under the mist, these tears are comforting, and they have never tried to plunder and steal, nor will they take by trickery and force. The old dog is great after all. It does not need people to jointly request, nor does it need to hold meetings to discuss, and it does not even put its name in the newspaper to show its solicitation. In spring, it puts on leaves for the trees, and in the hot summer season, it is used to shield from the scorching sun. In autumn and winter, people do not feel the threat of heat, so it floats down for people to pick up and burn!</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn in the Pen</p>
<h3>Trying the Pen</h3>
<p>— Murong Sui</p>
<p>In the New Year's publications, there is much talk about "New Year's Pen Trials" and similar things, and I suddenly feel, with a kind of hypersensitivity, several inexplicable "sighs."</p>
<p>For the pen to be used only for trials is already sufficiently "humble and receptive!" At one time, everyone could just not try any more, and be straightforward, but those who were trying were still trying, and at another time, it became almost impossible even to try, everyone was "fully wary," yet those who wanted to try were still trying!</p>
<p>Of course! If it's okay to try and you still try, "success lies in trying since ancient times;" but if it's not okay to try and you still try, "there's never been success in reckless trials?" This is my first sigh!</p>
<p>Those who try the pen are merely trying a pen, what difficulty is there? "Small Beijing Village," "Seven Purple Three Sheep," "Three Purple Seven Sheep," everyone can try, even the sniveling kids just starting their education can try, and because "opening the pen in the New Year brings great luck in everything," I truly feel that trying the pen is an extremely sorrowful "game!" If instead of trying the pen you tried a knife, "I have a pen like a knife" or "I have a precious knife," "trying its edge," wouldn't that be refreshing! Or if I had guns, cannons, airplanes, even more so atomic bombs, wouldn't that be even more refreshing and exhilarating? This is my second sigh!</p>
<p>Fortunately, trying the pen is ultimately not a pen test; it's not necessarily for becoming a "Juren in the imperial examination," and certainly not for getting into the "eighth rank of Jinshi." Thinking about it this way, I'm still more "unfettered" than those who "try the knife," "try guns and cannons," or "try the atomic bomb." This is my third sigh!</p>
<p>I'm indulging in wishful thinking again: "Trying the pen" might as well be changed to "Playing with the pen," which would be much more "unfettered." We, the people who move the pen, always prefer "unfetteredness," and we can be "unfettered" by being "unfettered," I'm thinking! My fellow "pen-triers," won't you think it's "meritorious to move but useless to play," or what?</p>
<h3>Where Should Art Go? How Should It Go?</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>The victory of the Anti-Japanese War is almost four months past, and everyone is busy with the work of repatriation. Our art department, it seems, is rarely mentioned. Because its contribution during the eight years was quite weak, it is no wonder that it is looked down upon today after the victory and has indeed fallen behind.</p>
<p>However, if art is to seek revival and development, what should be the current goal? And how can this goal be achieved? These are the problems we urgently need to solve.</p>
<p>To solve these problems, we should naturally first look at the current reality.</p>
<p>In the vast Chinese society, a common demand is for human freedom and happiness. If we in victorious China still retain the poisonous atmosphere of feudalism and still cause the masses to suffer, then this victory is in vain. Therefore, the direction that current art should take, in its active aspect, is to help the masses strive for freedom and happiness, and in its passive aspect, should be to eliminate feudalism and reduce all obstacles to the interests and future of mankind. In other words, our art should go from decadence to health, from sentimentality to joy, from deformity to rationality. It should not be "art for art's sake" in the aestheticist sense, nor "art for life's sake" in the narrow sense, but rather "art for the masses of humanity." To be clear: it is art that expresses the spirit of democracy.</p>
<p>We do not hope for a historical reproduction or reenactment of art; we absolutely despise individualism, geniusism, and heroism in art, as well as the emergence of so-called artists who serve the needs of a few. The art of Renaissance Italy or Germany is good, and the art of the Tang and Song dynasties in China is also acknowledged as good, but we absolutely do not recognize the reappearance of these things in the world or in China, because now it is the 20th century.</p>
<p>On the condition that we do not deny the historical value of these arts, we can only take the path of "sublation" now.</p>
<p>Western art, especially Western painting, has already become a tool of civilization like automobiles and airplanes and is shared by the world. Therefore, Chinese art should also take the path of the expressiveness of Western art, that is, adopt its materials and techniques.</p>
<p>Since current art belongs to the masses, all subjective forms of expression that are divorced from the masses should be abandoned. That is, we should not take the "xieyi" (sketching ideas) in Chinese traditional art and the strange forms of early 20th-century European art; we should use the form of "xieshi" (realism).</p>
<p>In Western realism, the realism of the Bariqye and Rococo eras is too crude and delicate, and the realism of naturalism is too weak. We might as well extract from the traditional spirit of French painting the realism of Ingres, Courbet, Cezanne, and even the modern Derain, but we should also extract the calligraphic spirit, the energy, the boneless style... these characteristics of Chinese national culture and infuse them into it. This is realism that contains elements of xieyi, an expression of the objective through the subjective, which is a new form of realism.</p>
<p>The content of art produced based on such forms of expression will certainly not be propaganda for the ruling class to suppress the ruled, nor a portrayal of the life of the bourgeoisie, nor entertainment or embellishments for a special class, the so-called "sycophantic" art. We demand works that reflect the theme of the brilliant democratic spirit. We hope for the rebirth of masters like Delacroix, Courbet, Millet, Paumier, and Zheng Xia, who painted "Refugee Pictures" later on, because their products once expressed a brilliant democratic spirit. Although the rebirth of masters is an impossible thing, we hope that the present or future artists, before conceiving your masterpieces, should learn from these historical masters in grasping the theme.</p>
<p>The art that is produced by expressing the theme of the democratic spirit through the new realistic form can be called "democratic new realism," which is what the masses are currently demanding.</p>

<h3>Our Newspaper Collects Relief Donations: We Want to Inspire Compassion and Maintain the Lives of Poor and Distressed Compatriots</h3>
<p>Our newspaper yesterday received a letter from He Dequi and Liu Hongsheng, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Shanghai Winter Relief Committee, requesting that we promote widely and collect donations on their behalf, and publish them in a dedicated column every day to provide encouragement. From today, we will comply with these requests. We hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will enthusiastically contribute and generously donate to jointly participate in this righteous cause. The association is the only relief organization in the city, with a sound structure and large scale. Its relief targets are refugees, disaster victims, widows, widowers, orphans, the disabled, and families of soldiers who fought in the war in the city, as well as families with three or more children who are extremely poor. The aforementioned people receiving relief are limited to those who cannot support themselves and have not received other relief. This scope is quite broad; all those who are utterly impoverished and helpless, as well as the poor who are hidden and have encountered misfortune, are included in the recipients of relief. The association will, in accordance with actual needs, carry out the following relief measures: (1) providing porridge or noodles (2) organizing sales at fair prices (3) distributing clothing and bedding (4) setting up shelters for the cold. These are all things that the poor urgently need, especially during the cold and freezing season! A few points in the association's constitution are also worth mentioning: (1) major merchants and industrial and commercial organizations that donate large quantities of rice, clothing, and bedding, or make large monetary donations, may be recommended for commendation or public recognition in accordance with the law. (2) The distribution of funds and goods should be preceded by a detailed investigation, and the amount of funds and goods that each person can receive should be announced before distribution, and the opinions of the donors should be accepted as much as possible. (3) If there are any false or inconsistent statements, or if the staff members engage in corruption, people are allowed to report them, and they will be investigated and dealt with immediately after verification. These three points alone show a glimpse of the sound organization of the association. It is hoped that enthusiastic and capable people will always think of the poor and give more help; the merit will be immeasurable!</p>

<h3>Reward of One Million Yuan for Locating Missing Aircraft</h3>
<p>Matters Related to Aviation Research Please Assist</p>
<p>"To whom it may concern, At the model airplane competition held by our association on December 30th at Hongkou Park, a large engine airplane made by Mr. Wu Shuiqing, a member of our association, flew out of the field during the performance due to a malfunction of the regulator and its whereabouts are unknown (after investigation, someone saw it over Wing On Company).

<h3>Qiu Wenxiang: Two People with the Same Name</h3>
<p>— (Yong Yu)</p>
<p>Those Seeking Relatives and Friends Please Note</p>
<p>Recently, Yong Yu was entrusted by his teacher to place an advertisement in the newspaper to look for Mr. Qiu Wenxiang.

However, yesterday, a fast mail letter was suddenly received from "Qiu Wenxiang, No. 75 Guiyuan Temple, Baojie Yuan, Chongqing," asking to forward it to "Old Lady Qiu." Upon opening it, the language in the letter was different from the previous letter, and it said, "We have been separated for several years. I was very ill in Chongqing in June this year. Now I want to return to Shanghai, but I lack funds. Please wire 200,000 yuan quickly." This is very surprising. Who is this Qiu Wenxiang from Chongqing? Please pay attention, readers.</p>
