<h3>主席昭吿全國同胞　對時局指出癥結之所在　策勉共同努才復興建設</h3>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺十三日電〕蔣主席頃發表吿全國同胞書，全文如下：</p>
<p>全國同胞們，日本向我同盟國無條件投降，到今天是整整一年了，我在去年今日，曾經指出「戰後復興與建設，其艱鉅將更倍於戰時。」我在當時就認定：首先要造成和平統一安定的環境，而後困苦的人民得以休養生息，復員與建設得以順利實施。現在時隔一年，政府仍然秉持這個不變的方針，但是事與願違，國家的困難沒有减輕，民生的痛苦沒有解除，省察過去，瞻望將來，眞覺得責任沉重，感想萬千，因此我要檢討一年來的經過，指示同胞們以時局癥結的所在，策勉我同胞有一致的認識和共同的努力。</p>
<p>共軍破壞經濟動脈造成當前嚴重現象</p>
<p>緊接着抗戰勝利我們的主要工作是復員，是要從戰時狀能恢復到平時狀態。這一年中間，政府是從戰時首都的重慶回到了南京，戰時限制人民自由的法令，是撤銷或修正了，國軍整編的工作，是已經依限實施，幾千的軍官已經退役了，遷建在內地的大學，正在陸續復校，破碎的城市，在重新改造，毁壊的堤防，在積極建築，而在不受共黨擾亂的地區以內，交通幹綫如粤漢鐵路全綫，是已經修復完成了，災荒的區域，是在進行着救濟，省縣各級的民選議會，是在繼續推廣·尤其是今年，全國各地農產物普遍豐收，戰後的飢饉，可望减輕，至於財政經濟方面，良本年三月以後，法幣的發行額就逐漸减少，到了七月，發行額便沒有增加了，這是一年來我們政府和人民在收復各地區共同努力辛勤拮据的收獲，其他未達預期目標的復員工作，有待我全國一致加緊努力而繼續推進的，當然還有很多。</p>
<p>但是就這一年來復員的進度與經過來說，我們實在是抱着無限的遺憾，當前最嚴重的現象，是生產停滯，經濟失調，物價高漲生活艱難，其最主要的原因，實在是交通阻滯，使國民經濟脈絡不能暢通的緣故。我們長江和沿海的水道，雖是通航了，而船舶的數量還是不敷，粤漢·京滬杭鐵路雖在通車，而平漢·津浦·膠濟·隴海這些經濟動脈的幹綫，都遭受共產軍的破壊與阻斷，因此工業中心原料恐慌，而農礦產品沒有銷塲，商業口岸貨物堆積，而廣大內地缺乏物資，這樣就造成了游資充斥，人民貧困的現象，加以若干被共黨割據的地區，封鎖食糧，擅發紙幣，剝削地方，隔絕交通，自成經濟單位，因之，國民經濟組織的離析分崩，使得物價的平抑，民生的救濟，復員的進行，生產的恢復，增加了意外不測的困難，這是我們所困心衡慮，力求解決的問題。</p>
<p>七個月來政治演變證明希望均成幻想</p>
<p>檢討上面所說各種困難的最大癥結，還在於國內政治糾紛不能解決，和平秩序備受破壊，人民最低限度安居樂業的要求，尙且不能實現，當然更談不上增加生產與發展經濟。我們政府自去年抗戰結束，就確定了「國家統一」和「政治民主」的方針，切望以政治方式解決黨派紛爭，在國家民族共同利益之下，團結一致，走上和平建設的民主憲政大道。我們明知中國共產黨不是遵循通常民主方式的政黨，而是擁有其獨立的武力，自立行政系統，自徵人民賦稅，自處於國家政令以外，但是政府仍多方努力，期待其放棄武力割據的成見，轉化爲和平合法的政黨，同循民主的軌轍，共策建設的進行。在這一年中間，政府先與共產黨代表作懇切的談商，繼又邀集各黨代表及社會賢達舉行政治協商會議，成立了五項協議，同時政府與共黨代表在馬歇爾特使協助之下，簽訂了停止衝突與恢復交通的辦法，確定整編國軍及統編共軍爲國軍的方案，這些決議和方案，是一年來政府苦心努力的結晶，也是全國人民一致的祈求，可以說，國家前途與人民幸福，都取決於這幾個協議和方案的是否實施。不幸這七個月來的演變，證明我們政府與人民的希望都成幻想，共產黨割據的地盤，正在一天天的乘機擴大，他們的要求隨時增加，成議軋被翻，軍事調處不受尊重，而破壞和平的行動有加無已。這樣，不獨使人民困苦惶惑，更使政府對於一切復員的設施無法進行，大家知道中國的內外環境，決不容再有戰亂的發生，但是世界上任何政府，又決不能放棄其維該國家行政主　與保際人民生命財產安全的責任。</p>
<h3>今後處理時局方針</h3>
<p>說到這裏，我要爲我全國同胞說明我們國民政府今後處理時局的方針，我們中國經此長期艱苦的抗戰，都市殘破，鄕村疲敝，工業摧殘，農作荒廢，有如大病以後的人身，需要溫和安靜的培補與療養，因此，政府對於國內政治問題，始終主張和平解決，在不違背三民主義，不動搖國家根本的限度以內，不惜忍辱負重，寬容退讓，務期爲我全體同胞謀得休養生息的機會，我們政府即在共產黨屢次違反協議，挑起衝突的時候，仍一貫尊重調處執行部的意見，厲行整軍方案的規定，對於已成立的協議，巳簽訂的方案，始終信守，絕不因情勢的變遷而推翻成議，這些都有過去的事實足炎證明。至於今後的方針，可爲我同胞明吿者：</p>
<p>（一）斷不因任何阻碍而延　結束訓政開始憲政的程序，十一月十二日的國民大會必定如期召集。</p>
<p>（二）對於政治協商會議所有的決議，必衷誠遵守，盡力推行，關於憲法草案，祇求薈萃各方面更好的意見，提供國民大會討論抉擇，以期制成完善可行的憲法。</p>
<p>（三）對於擴大政府基礎，邀請各黨派無黨派人士參加，務求從速實現，並以和平建國綱領爲施政的準繩。</p>
<p>（四）關於停止衝突，仍必遵守原議，忠實履行，而且我們並不要求共軍全部退出其在停戰令後所攻估的地區，祇是要求其撤出若干已經　成和平威脅和阻碍交通的地區</p>
<p>（五）關於政治粉爭，仍採取政治解決的方法，只要共產黨軍隊忠實執行停止衝突，恢復交通的成議，遵從調處，實施統編，使軍隊國家化不致徒託空言，此　一有保證，政府隨時可與之具體商談所有未决的問題。</p>
<p>（六）當前人民最迫切的要求，在於安居樂業，所以政府必當盡力解除和平的威脅，更必竭盡職責，以保障人民生命財產與安全。上面所述的各點，實爲處理目前時局的要旨，亦即政府無可旁貸的職責，中正　生革命，旨在求得國家統一，解除同胞痛苦，實行三民主義，造成民主政治，以策國家的長治久安，祇有責任義務的觀念，絕無任何得失毁　的成見。只要各黨派方面均能以國家民族的利益爲重，誠信相爭，共產黨亦能顧念人民痛苦，以事實表現其實行協議的誠意，則建國的障碍，即不難消除，而時局的困難，亦立可澄消。</p>
<h3>對共黨唯一要求　勿以武裝奪取擴張地盤　用政治方式來竸取選舉</h3>
<p>同胞們，我們大家再平心靜氣的，就一年來的經過，回想一下，如果在日本投降以後，我們國內沒有什麼糾紛和變亂，政府祇求和平統一的期望，眞能如期達成，武裝黨派，不再對政府分歧對立，企圖擴展其地盤，分裂我國家，那我們國家的地位和信譽，將是何等的光榮，我們民族的前途和歷史，在世界上將是如何的偉大，而我們各地社會和人民生活，又將是如何的安定而幸福。再退一步說，即使在今年一月間，如果政府與共黨所訂立的停止衝突，恢復交通與整編軍隊的三種協定，共產黨方面也能按期如約切實實施，而對於政治協商會議的決議，眞能誠意履行，按期推選代表參加國民政府，出席國民大會，那麼在三個月以前，國民大會早可如期召集，國家的憲法，應已制定頒布，三民主義的民主政治，亦可獲得初步的實現，何至到了今天，還要遭受世界輿論的誤解和譏刺，國家還要蒙受如此的恥辱，而我們同胞更何至再受如蘇北·冀·魯等處決堤成災，水深火熱的痛苦呢？我說這一番話，實在是萬分的痛心，但是往者不諫，來者可追，我還是殷切期待各黨派有同樣的反省，我們八年抗戰，是怎樣的艱辛，軍民同胞們的犧牲，是怎樣所籌成的勝利成果，我們全國無論何人，都應該珍重保持，加以發掦光大，斷不可輕予摧殘，以致斷送國本。我們中國今天最需要的，無過於和平建設，這是共產黨也一致承認而明白表示的，但是和平建設的進行，必須各政黨同循民主政治的常軌，勿在國家軍隊以外擁有自主的武力，勿採用武力奪取政權的方式，以擴張地盤，分裂國家，而用政治競爭的方式，來競取選擧，這樣纔能够建立眞正的民主政治。因此，統編共軍爲國軍的方案，必須依照實行，而後國家乃眞有和平統一實行民主的希望。我們今天所要求於共產黨者，唯一要點即在變更其武力奪取政　的政策，化武裝的政黨爲和平的政黨，勿使國家之內另有變相的國家，以妨碍統一，勿使國軍之外復有對立的軍隊，以擾亂和平，總要使國內擾攘的秩序得以恢復常態，和平建設的計劃得以如期進行，這一點，實在是解除目前時局癥結的要點。亦是政府爲國家，爲人民向共產黨必需提出的最低要求，而且我可斷言，這也是全國同胞共同迫切的期望。</p>
<p>總之，政府對於和平解決的方針，始終一貫，決不變更，對於實施政協會議的決議與實行民主憲政的旣定步驟，斷不因政治現象的變化或黨派意見的紛歧而怠忽其初衷，政府必能盡其在我，期待共產黨的感悟，增進各黨派的諒解，但是同胞們對於當前國家的局勢和國民應盡的職責，也必須有眞確深切的認識。我們中國本是一個貧弱落後的國家，而且是百年來受着帝國主義重重桎梏的一個次殖民地國家，現在剛從這種壓迫之下掙扎出來，內憂外患積因至久，復興大業當然不是一朝一夕所能立致，我們今天要消弭變亂，克服艱難，建設中國爲和平統一民主强盛的國家，不但政府人員要檢討缺點，負責盡職，効忠國家，同時更需要我全國同胞有信心，有耐性，有愛國的熱情，有救國的眞誠，共同匪勉，一致戮力。</p>

<h3>饒伯森今赴京</h3>
<p>尚馬帥報吿安平事件</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕馬帥對安平事件似極焦灼，渠已電召執行部美方委員饒伯森十四日赴京，報吿安平事件經過及調查情形。十三日饒伯森曾赴西苑機塲歡迎司徒大使，並與之同車正對　燕京臨湖　，密談安平事件達四十五分鐘始　出。執行部三委員迄今仍未能對調查程序有所決定，故十三日晨廿五小組開會時，戴維斯會宣稱：彼已草一報吿，叙述小組週來工作情形，如政府，共產黨贊同，可簽字作爲小組報吿，政府，共產黨允予會外考慮後，十四日晨九時答覆。十三日開會時，未曾吵架，空氣較鬆，爲週來會議所僅見。</p>
<h3>中長路第二大橋　被共軍澈底破壞</h3>
<p>北寗路一鐵橋該被炸</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十二日電〕交通界息，中長路松花江橋以北百華里處，共軍所控制之拉林河鐵橋，已於十一日被共軍澈底破壊，該橋長五百米，有廿一孔，爲中長路沿綫之第二大橋。又悉共軍刻已劃定對哈爾濱松花江橋周圍五百米以內，禁止行人通過，似有準備破壞模樣。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕北寗路經中東沙河與白廟子間之三一二號鐵橋，今晨一時被共軍炸毁。</p>
<h3>行政院例會</h3>

<p>楊公達長英士大學</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕政院十三日上午舉行第七五五次會議，宋院長主席，議決各案擇載如次：（一）設立荷　坤甸領事館案，決議通過。（二）兼任捷克斯拉夫大使金間泗應免兼職，遺缺特任梁龍繼任，（三）賠償調查委員會兼主任委員蔣　麟請辭職應免兼職，遺缺派　學逐繼任。（四）任命楊公達爲國立英士大學校長。（五）任命陸志鴻爲國立台灣大學校長。（六）交通部航政司司長高廷梓另有聘用，應予免職。</p>
<h3>中蘇訂約一週年　兩國關係無進展</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京十三日電〕本月十五日爲中蘇友好條約成立第一週年，中國與其北鄰之關係，與條約之字面及精神，相差仍遠。據中國當局稱，與蘇聯簽訂三十年協定，曾在東九省對蘇聯作重大讓步，惟自條的簽訂之日起，即被違犯。一年以來，中蘇關係非但並未改善，且見惡劣，實無疑問，此種情形大抵由於國共間軍政爭執之結果，國共問題不解決，中蘇關係鮮有改善之望。由種種方式證實，中共實獲得蘇聯全部精神上的支持。此一事實對於解決內爭之每一行動，均佔重要地位，國共雙方亦密切注意蘇聯對於此事之關切。中共之宣傳行動與莫斯科之宣傳密切聯緊，延安最近發起反美行動，莫斯科方面亦繼之高呼反對美國「千涉」中國云。</p>
<h3>派赴日本佔領軍　乘輪經香港來滬</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港十三日電〕我派赴駐日本佔領軍國軍第六十七師師長戴堅，率部分搭「海地」「海川」二輸，十三日晨九時抵港，即晚六時續程赴滬。</p>
<h3>中國局勢嚴重　影響世界安危　美各報論馬帥司徒之聲明</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十二日電〕美國各報評論馬歇爾司徒雷登之聯合聲明，僉聲明，僉認聲明中暗示中國局勢之嚴重，影響整個世界安危，不僅中國一國而已也。紐約時報社論以〔暗雲　龍罩下之中國」爲題，力言中國前途之黑暗，無如馬帥司徒共同聲明所述之甚。中國四萬萬以上人民，將不惜整個經濟崩潰而捲入違反其意志之內戰。暗　顯正龍罩於中國，其陰影通過全世界。馬司共同聲明，殆係吾國對華政策之修正之預兆。時至此際，中國人民悲慘之呼聲，或能打動延安强硬份子之心腸。就吾人所知，國民黨代表中國五分之四人民，中共則爲少敷派，要求平等或超過平等以上，權力主義之衝突如此其甚，則欲灌注民主意識，任何人均將徒勞。馬歇爾特使已坦白承認一事無成，假令吾人對華取消援助，悲劇的中國將少有希望矣。</p>
<p>紐約前鋒講壇報稱：美國應盡其全力，以謀制止目前大禍，縱令馬使及司徒大使飽受種種困難，亦不能使吾人無餒。</p>
<p>兩幅漫畫</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕今日美國各報對於中四政治僵局仍異常注意。各報均在封面登載電訊，謂馬歇爾特使與司徒大使顯已放棄促成國共和解之希望，並登載關於中國時局之論文與漫畫，華盛頓郵報在封面登載漫畫名曰：「懸崖」，繪馬歇爾站在懸崖邊緣，崖邊有「美國對華政策之失敗」字樣。巴爾的摩太陽報亦載一漫畫，表示中國被巨墻分隔，牆壁書「國共紛爭」字樣，其上繪一孤伶人物，像徵「中國老百姓」，被鞭撻至火刑柱，柱上書有「內戰的威脅」字樣。</p>
<p>胡適見解</p>
<p>〔本報北平十二日電〕爲馬帥與司徒大使聲明記者請胡適發表對馬帥與司徒大使聯合聲明之見解，胡氏稱：希望看見該聲明原文，因中央社未發稿，而各報所譯不同，故尙未看懂，但余（胡自稱）一貫主張共黨應有決心放棄武力，以在野第一大黨之地位，則其前途無限，蓋以一民治國家絕不許有二個擁有武力的政黨相對抗爭政權，現在執政之英國工黨，五十年前大選僅得五萬票，去年大選則獲九千二百萬票之支持。記者再請傅斯年談話時，渠則連稱頭痛而絕口不談。</p>
<h3>共黨又欲建議　三國共同調解</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十三日電〕據消息靈通方面稱：共產黨不久將建議由美，蘇，英三國共同調解中國國內之僵局。據稱：共產黨惟恐國軍對彼等發動全面攻勢時，軍事局勢將與彼等　不利，故欲拉攏蘇聯，以加強其地位。</p>

<h3>司徒大使飛抵平　據稱主席月底將返京　文吿對和平當有幫助</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕司徒大使今日午後乘五星專被飛平，隨行者爲其顧間傳涇波及秘書陶履中二人。此次赴平，爲料理燕大校務，約勾留旬日即返京。大使今晨曾與馬帥通話兩次，並接見政府代表兪大維。據聞，兪氏曾面請其繼續努力，勿抱消極，並表示送行之意。兪氏於訪大使前，曾訪馬帥。又聞馬帥可能於明日再赴廬山。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕司徒雷登抵平後，對記者否認馬司聯合聲明即談判之喪鐘，及馬帥即將回國之說，渠稱：和平之門並未全閉，談判可望繼續進行，彼與馬帥對中國和平，一如過去懷抱希望。記者問：聯合聲明能否予麻庫之和平談判以一較佳刺戟？渠答：希望如比·記者問：假如和平談判失敗，美國是否改變對華政策？答：屆時可能如此，但吾人並不希望如此，目前對華政策亦未改變。記者詢以對安平事件意見如何？大使拒絕答覆。大使稱：彼預定週後返京，引次北來係料理私人及　大事務。某記者詢以月來奔走京應感覺是作大使好還是作校長好？大使笑答：「還是作校長好！」或問：軍調部是否將撤銷？大使使答「否。」大使所乘馬帥五星座機，於下午一時五分離京，三時三刻抵達西苑機塲。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕司徒大使稱：蔣主席有月底之前回京消息。記者詢以廬山是否已準備開一舉國一致之時局談話會，大使稱，彼尙未獲知此事。大使對蔣主席今日之文吿評論稱。「很好，很好，這個文吿對和平會有帶助。」</p>

<h3>主席告同胞書</h3>
<p>因此，我要在敵人投降一週年紀念日的今天，特別提出三點，指示我同胞以共固努力的方向，以慰我為抗戰犧牲的軍民同胞在天之靈：</p>
<p>明是非張正氣</p>
<p>第一，要明是非，張正氣，國家民族的安危治亂，全　於人民是非觀念與公理正氣的消長，人之智愚，事之成敗，皆在於明辨是非，洞察利害，是非之所在，即為利害之所在，我國八年抗戰，所以能持久致勝的原因，全由我全國軍民，只見是非而不計利害，只知大義而不惜犧牲的精神，由此可知利害決定於是非，大利所在，必為大是，而大非所在，終為大害，決不可以一時個人的利害，而顛倒真正的是非，置國家民族，永久的禍福於不顧，當此危疑震盪的時刻，尤需要根據事實，明辨是非的所在，使國論有定準，人心有定向，則國家雖有一時的變亂，終必能迅速平復，而臻於治安，否則真偽倒置，黑白混淆，邪說披猖，正論消歇，久而久之，勢必至習非成是，以害為利，而國家民族乃陷於不可救藥的境地。所以我們同胞常此時機，必須伸張正氣，闡明是非，切勿隨波逐流，自誤誤國，默察近來一般的風氣，幾乎祇講利害，而不講是非，祗知暴力，而不知正義，祗知有偶人，而不知有國家，這種現象，必須澈底改正，國家方有光明的前途。</p>
<p>明禮義知廉恥</p>
<p>第二，要明禮義，知廉恥，國於大地，必有興立。我們中國立國數千年中，經無數變亂，而能屹立不墮，全賴我民族道德的高尙，與民族文化的偉大，而禮義廉恥，國之四維，尤為我民族普遍深入的道德標準，約而言之，禮義示人以積極行為的教條，而廉恥乃是戒人以不可行的範圍，我們當此戰後道德水準備受　喪，尤其一般都市人慾橫流，各以避難趨易，巧取豪奪為能事，我全國有志之士，當以挽救民族，建立國家為己任，必須作中流的砥柱，挽頹糜的人心。我們能夠明禮儀，自然見義勇為，全力以赴，守禮盡分，一絲不苟，我們能夠知廉恥，自然能自重自愛，不失人格，　不致有自貶尊嚴的行為，而為外人所輕視，如此以廉恥相　　，以禮儀為準備，則社會乃有積極向上的精神，國家乃能樹立獨立自由的基礎，否認，廉恥掃地，禮儀淪喪，抗戰雖戰而猶敗，國家雖存而猶亡，事之可悲，莫甚於此，我愛國自愛的國民，真不可不警惕自勉。</p>
<p>明責任守法紀</p>
<p>第三，要明責任，守法紀，現代國家的國民，無不重視責任，亦無不尊重法紀，惟其重視責任，所以能精勸奮發，唯其尊重法紀，所以能秩序不　，這兩者就是造成這步向上的動力。我們中國百事落後，二法紀觀念最為薄弱，今當世界說　未定之秋，又值國事紛紜之會，要克　艱危，力求振作，自躋於現代國家之林，必須重觀責任，為　戰守，要知道政府有政府的責任，國民也有國民的責任，必須明辨審察，各　其能，各盡其責，勿自　卸，勿稍怠忽，而後經　萬端，乃能事無不舉。同時，我全國上下，無論何人，都必須明決重紀，遵守秩序，官史不可濫用職權，妨礙人民的自由，人民亦不可濫用自由，放棄國民的天職，尤其要切戒蔑視法律，破壞秩序，務使我社會為嚴整不紊的社會，我人民為真能自重自治的人民。</p>
<p>復興大業必須完成　任何阻力不能遏止</p>
<p>需遵行的原則，我更要求我全國同胞。服膺「風雨如晦，雞鳴不已」的古訓，特別要堅定信心，　礪志節，認清我國戰後復興與世界正義關係的重要，勿存悲觀，勿自惶惑，我們對百抗戰，強弱異勞，八年苦鬥，何等艱難，終賴信心不搖，獲致最後勝利。回溯當時，</p>
<p>上述各點，為一般國民平時必守的基準，尤為復員建國時期必可云一無憑藉，所恃者惟在我民族數千年固有文化和道德精神，以及人類公理與世界正義，我們中國抗戰的勝利，增加了國際正誼力量和道義的權威。如果在擊敗日本以後，而我們中國因不能保持勝利成果，仍然不免於危亂喪亡，這不但是我們自身的不幸。對於人類的正義，將是如何重大的打擊。明瞭了這個意義，就知道我們此時轉旋國內局勢，實現和平統一的努力，實在是對民族，對世界最莊嚴的任務。現在抗職早經結束，祗待掃除荊棘，努力　後，從事復興，完成建國大業，以今　　，我們在抗戰時期，既有這樣堅忍不拔的精神，百折不回的志氣，我們民族又有這樣悠久的歷史與偉大的文化，還有什麽困難不可以克服，什麼建設不可以完成。當前現象雖極錯綜複雜，而常理正規則是始終不易的，我們要自信，我們民族的前途始終是光明遠大，任何阻力決不能　止我們的復興。中正自許身革命，經歷百艱，領導抗戰，時逾八載，斷不能任令我無數軍民犧牲流血所換取的中華民國之生命輕予摧毀，決不忍使我鋒餘生的人們增加痛苦，已決不因任何的刺激或阻而變更我祈求和平統一民主的既定步驟，勢必本我良知，盡我天職，按程序，循常軌，領導我全國同胞，向建國的大道而邁進，耿耿心願，乘今日紀念的機會，而　　於我同胞之前，深望一德一心，努力奮鬥，以消弭我國家的浩劫，保全我民族的命脈，共同一致，克竟我革命建國的全功。（完）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>民族復興的大憲章</h3>
<p>— 讀　主席文告紀感</p>
<p>國內外人士所殷切期待的蔣主席的文告，終於在日本無條外投降一周年的前難一無一槳龔一申這一年來，人民的顛沛流離及其所遭受的苦難，依舊不減，國內政治上的紛爭，依舊未息，我們讀了主席的文告，衷心感到慰藉。這就是政府對於處理當前的紛亂，所以不惜忍辱負重寬容退讓者，實以顧全人民福利，國家當大戰之後，元氣大傷，不堪再有戰亂。凡此苦心，不但為全國人民所共諒，抑為全國人民所共戴。所以國內的局勢雖然嚴重到這樣，而政府仍本和平統一方針處理當今政治的紛爭，觀乎</p>
<p>主席在其文告內所提關於今後的方針中之第五項，「只要共產黨軍隊忠實執行停止衝突，恢復交通的成議，遵從調處實施統編，使軍隊國家化不致徒托空言，此層一有保設，政府隨時可與之具體商談所有未決的問題。」不特表示政府所抱態度的寬大仁厚，而且更足以表示談判即可重開之路未絕。中國人民在讀到了主席的文告，衷誠感奮，自不侍言。們己飽受共黨的禍患，亟望國內的局勢能夠趨於安定，使他們有一個生養休息的機會，他們不能忍受這種局勢的長此拖延下去，政府的不惜委曲求全，忍辱負重，固爭能夠得以早日解決，他們這種希望之所以幻滅，實由於共黨的破壞。所以我們今天在讀了主席的文告，只有竭誠再向中共作一切迫的呼籲，希望他們能以全國人民意向為重，顧全人民刦後的苦難，以事實表現其執行前此所成立的協議之誠意。政府對於共黨不能不算寬大，在此寬大優厚的條件下，共黨實應以民族利益為重，不再橫生阻撓，那末中國纔能走士復興的大道。</p>
<p>在關於解決國內政治紛爭今後所持的方針，我們研讀全文，彷彿感覺到這真是我國民族復興的一道大憲章，其所列舉的條款及其所蘊蓄的精神，足與大西洋憲章先後輝映。這里指出了我們今後政治的途徑，重申了政府準備結束訓政及實施憲政的決心，及與各黨各派衷誠合作的夙願，凡此所未，實為我今後政治民主化的準繩，尤為一般人民所渴望。</p>
<p>但我們尤其感到感奮的是主席所昭示我們的三點，這就是要明是非，張正氣，要明禮義知廉恥來提高我們民族道德的水準，要明責任守法紀來建立我們的社會秩序。這些看上去或不免被認為陳腐，但實是此後我們民族復興的必要基礎。真理本沒有陳腐新鮮之別，只要是真理，無不永遠長新。中國現在一切問題之　結便是在是非不明，道德不振，紀律不守。因為有這種現象，所以綱紀失墜。抗戰既告勝利，今後向建國復興的大道邁進，必須有其道德的基礎。中國人民對於主席這三點的昭告，尤應刻骨銘心，時時警惕。國於大地，必有興立，我國向為注重禮義之邦，對於道德，素極重視，此實為我民族發展的優厚基礎，晚近以來，國人多以道德為迂腐，殊不知無道德的民族，不能立於世界。西歐各國，物質文明雖極發達，倘無其道德規律為人民乃至國家行為的準繩，安有今日的興盛。所以如果要使我們的民族復興，我們不得不將民族復興的遭德基礎建立起來。</p>
<p>綜讀主席全文，實以信望愛為其基礎。信者，指人民對政府要有信任，政府始終以人民的利益為重，故始終主張以政治方式解決政治紛爭，因此，人民對於政府要有信任。再則，各方對於解決政治紛爭必須具有信義，己成立的協議，即是諾言，必須信守，忠實執行。愛者，指人民固然愛護政府，而政府亦愛人民，所以「不惜忍辱負重，寬容退讓，務期為我全體同胞謀得修養生息機會」。同時，共黨雖擴大割據地盤，要求隨時增加，成議輒被推翻，但政府仍一本寬大，「只要共產黨軍隊忠實執行停止衝突，恢復交通的成議，遵從訓處，實施統編，使軍隊國家化不致徒托空言，此層一有保證，政府可隨時與之具體商談所有未決的問題」。這不是「愛」是什麼？望者希望共黨能以人民利益為重，使和平統一得以實現，又希望人民能夠明是非，朋禮義知廉恥，明責任守法紀。我們讀畢了全文，益信國內紛爭的必能解決，中國民族的必能復興，而主席這篇文告，實是我們民族復興的大憲章！</p>

<h3>蘇聯對土投政治炸彈　要求海峽控制權　英主張召開國際會議　討論修改蒙德婁條約</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十三日廣播：蘇聯已於本月八日正式通知土耳其，主張修改蒙德婁協定，認為　旭尼爾海峽行政權應置於黑海各國管理之下，由　土爾國共同負責海峽方位工作。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十三日廣播：英國外交部發言人今日稱：如因修正蒙德婁協定而舉行國際會議，美國得派代表參加，但該協定之其他三簽字國，即日本，羅馬尼亞與保加利亞因曾在軸心國方面作戰之故，恐無出席機會。按蒙德婁協定應重予考慮一點，英美蘇三國在波茨坦會議中曾簽協議。</p>
<p>〔路邊社伊斯坦埠十二日電〕劇最近消息稱：蘇聯向土耳其所提要求修改蒙特婁公約之照會中，表示希望僅許黑海沿岸諸國討論海峽之新地位，及通航之控制制辯法。黑海沿岸諸國乃蘇聯·羅馬尼亞·保加利亞及土耳其。</p>
<p>〔路邊社伊斯坦埠十二日電〕蘇聯要求修改蒙特婁公約一事，已由土耳其新成立之貝克內閣在考慮中。據悉，蘇聯不但要求修改蒙特婁公約，且欲要求與土耳其共同控制并防禦韃靼尼爾海峽。土閣昨曾開會多次，至深夜始已。官方對於蘇聯照會之內容，仍力守緘默，此間人土均認蘇聯此舉，為一政治上之炸彈，預料土政府不久即將公佈蘇照會及土覆牒之全文。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社土耳其其京城十二日電〕劇半官方面所知，土國致蘇聯覆文，將說明依照蒙特婁海峽公約規定，唯有獲得所有各簽約國之同意，公約條款始能加以修正，故此事不能單由蘇土爾國進行談判。外交界人士咸以為土耳其對此問題，將採取堅決立場，并認為海峽問題傒與土國生存利益有關之最重大問題。</p>
<p>英決為土耳其後盾　勢將引起外交衝突</p>
<p>〔路邊社倫敦十二日電〕此間人土預料，因蘇聯要求修正蒙德婁條約關於使用韃靼尼爾之規定，勢又將引起蘇聯與西方國家間之外交衝突。英政府將為土耳其之後盾，　讓其反對蘇聯欲在土耳其其海峽區內取得根據地之願望，但英國鑒於其在蘇聯土運河所處之近似情形，殆將尋覓一種折衷辦法，以滿足蘇聯之安全要求。英政府於週杪所收到之蘇聯照會，內容尚未宣佈，但據可靠方面稱，蘇聯以其在黑海之領導地位及其安全等理由，當將其共同控制及保衛韃靼尼爾之要求，列在該照會之內，此即須在土耳其其境內建立軍事及航空根據地之謂。土耳其政府自將認為喪害其獨立權及國家安全，而予以斷然拒絕。英國現希望能勸導蘇聯接受折衷辦法，促其加入聯合各國控制海峽通路之委員會，盡英國亦擁護聯合國於上年十一月間所提修改蒙德婁條約之原則。</p>
<h3>神秘飛彈　又光顧瑞典天空　瑞參謀部認局勢嚴重　眾稱為俄國Ｖ四飛彈</h3>
<p>〔路邊社瑞典京城十二電〕最近時有神秘飛彈經過瑞典天空。中部天空昨又有發現，全國空氣已是異常緊張狀態。傳瑞典政府已向英國借得雷達多副，偵查此項神秘炸彈來源。美長程炸彈專家杜立德將軍已啟程來此，官方雖謂此來係代殼牌汽油公司接洽商務，然一般成信與神秘炸彈有關。瑞典參謀部今日宣布「局勢異常嚴重」！瑞典主權之一再被侵，顯已不能再予容忍，自當以種種方法，結束此項危險狀態。昨夜及今晨，參謀部接獲有關神秘火箭炸彈之</p>
<p>報告愈千件　當局亦已派專家至全國各處調查證據。各處報告不一，有謂係屬圓形者，但均謂炸後曾射出小型火彈。瑞典　眾近多稱之為「俄國Ｖ四」飛彈。瑞政府已令駐芬公使館，與芬蘭當局，會同調查。</p>
<p>〔聯合社瑞典京城十二日電〕今日此間報戰一有經驗之觀察家稱：昨曾見一無人火箭飛過，體如魚雷，其尾尖削，吐出青綠色光　之煙與一連串火球。此觀察家曾受觀察天象訓練，自火箭出現時，即用遠鏡向雲間注視。其駛行速度較飛機為高，最後一聲爆炸，即完全消滅不見，并無煙，光，或火星遺留·此火箭</p>
<p>長約九十呎　至一百呎，（三十公尺），爆炸前曾停留空中，開始降落，火光一閃，使人目為之眩。前傳經過瑞士之火箭，　自　　波　的海岸發出，　其爆炸情形，足證係掣有自動毀減啟備，致專家無從查得其蹤跡。瑞典報紙可證明確　自動毀減之藥。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社瑞典羅里亞　十三日電〕昨夜有炸彈一枚落於諸蘭省某處樓房。瑞典空軍某中尉曾目擊其事，謂飛彈形如魚雷，長約二十公尺，該彈飛行時有火尾一道。瑞典當局已在諾蘭區加強警戒，按挪威境內亦時有飛彈落下，一般揣測：係由德境蘇聯佔領區方面發射。</p>
<h3>美噴射火箭　創造新紀錄</h3>
<p>〔聯合社佛　尼亞州列契蒙十二日電〕劇陸軍方面宣佈：噴射推進P-80火箭，今日以三十五分鐘時間，自沃　沃州合　射至此間，飛程共長三百九十五哩，造成非正式新紀錄。</p>
<h3>又一批印兵　開抵巴斯拉　伊擬向安理會申訴</h3>
<p>〔路邊社報遠十二日電〕今日　有船兩艘，自印度連兵抵巴斯拉，以保護伊朗南部英、印、及阿拉伯之利斧。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十二日電〕伊朗駐美大使阿勒今日宣稱：英軍之出現於巴斯拉，以及英方採取偏面行動之威　，不能容忍，此種局勢，可能迫使伊朗將此項爭端向安理會提出。</p>
<h3>蘇聯攻擊荷蘭　斥為英美附庸</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十二日電〕蘇聯政論家塞基耶夫　此荷蘭在和會中之態度，加以批評。略稱，荷蘭乃「英美之佃奴耳」，研究「英美領袖」眾其「附庸」間之關係，即足以了解荷代表國之態度。荷關係一小　而擁有廣大殖民地，包括印度尼西亞在內，其所有殖民地六十倍於本土，如欲加以開發，其工作殊非荷蘭武力所能勝任，兒不得不與強者力之國家共同經管。荷蘭蠻富之領土，目下不僅由其一國開發，英美兩國，均亦參加在內云。</p>
<h3>日投降周年　吉田向全國廣播</h3>
<p>〔合眾社東京十三日電〕日首相吉田將於八月十四日，日本投降一周紀念日東京時間下午七時三分，向全國人民發表廣播演說。</p>
<h3>和會又一前敵國代表　羅副首相昨發言　對收回戰前失土衷心表感謝所蒙損害應由德勾兩國賠償</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十三日廣播：和會於今日下午三時零五分（上海午夜）繼續開會。羅馬尼亞代表國長即副首相塔達雷斯哥，經貝爾納斯之邀請，於四時十分發言。首對四強外長會議所擬對羅和約內閣點表示感謝之意。謂和約草案規定以外錫爾凡尼亞省北部歸還羅馬尼亞，是為使羅人衷心感謝之另一原由，此舉可令羅勾兩國民族臻於　密之合作。</p>
<p>幾即分就政治軍經濟各項條文，逐一申論，對例如羅馬尼亞傾向盟國陣線而成為軸心參戰國家之身份地位，未獲表明一節，表示遺憾，塔氏承認羅國係背叛國奸逆及冒險家之貿然行動，牽入反蘇戰事，但力言自一九四四年八月廿四日起，基於休戰協定，羅軍十八師，共卅八萬五千人，　配以空軍部隊，即向德鈉粹侵略者及勾軍實行突擊，先後死傷至少在十一萬以上，其時并無一兵一卒再與德方並肩作戰者，對盟方已盡其忠誠，故所受損失，應由德匈兩國賠償，羅國實有此要求權利也云。塔達雷斯哥副首相年事尚輕，開始演說時，顯有「怯場」之狀，但旋即恢復其信心態度。</p>
<h3>出席和會各委會　我代表名單</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎十二日電〕我國出席巴黎之和會代表團，已將各委會中代表我國之人員名單決定如下：出席一般問題委會之代表為王世杰與郭泰祺，對義和約之政治與領土委會之代表為郭泰祺，對義和約之軍事委會代表亦為傳秉常，法律起草委會之代表為錢泰。</p>
<p>〔路邊社巴黎十二日電〕和會大會討論大會秘書處之組織，蘇聯反對以澳外長伊瓦特為秘書，建議一阿比西尼亞充任，但遭阿國拒絕。英國逐建議以中國·巴西·南斯拉夫曾同四強組織秘書處，當被採納，并選法國之特巴克為秘書長。</p>
<h3>對意大利總理陳詞　蘇外長痛加駁斥　謂須根除反法西斯餘孽　希阿代表亦陳述意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十三日廣播：昨夜和會討論對義和約時，貝爾納斯與維辛斯基會發生激辯，今日莫洛托夫又指責若干大國不願法義兩國之利益，擬在地中海方面造成獨霸之地位。</p>
<p>〔法國新　社巴黎十三日電〕和會頃於本日午前十時開會，仍由美　　　貝爾納斯主席，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫曾光顧　意見，駁斥義會現加斯貝利日前在和會之演說，　爾　嚴厲，但空氣遠較規程委會之　　為肅靜·法總理皮杜爾及英外相員文均未出席，澳外長伊瓦特遂一調換地位，與友人談心，蘇聯代表區則傾聽英氏之演說·英氏之書曰，佘相信義大利將成為自由偉大之民族，羅索里尼的意大利過去曾採取帝國主義途徑，與德日勾結，義大利并會侵略阿比西尼亞·阿爾巴尼亞及法國，甚至斯達格勒一役，德軍大敗退，義打利始逐漸與德國分裂，過去實事斑斑可考。夫法西斯主義之失敗，並非義大利應降為二等國家之　，義大利與法國均不失其為地中海大國之地位。維新與的義大利，必須與聯邦敦膛關係，並應與各民主國家推誠相見。義國政治生命必須改造成為民主國家，援減法西斯主義餘孽，凡此諸端，義大利均未達到。加斯貝利君通篇演說中，對於法西斯主義與墨索里尼，並無雙字道及，宗旨所在，母　為其本國利益辯護，加君堅持法西斯主義之侵略領　，（斯拉夫各國代表　戰爭）加君遠及特里埃斯及伊斯脫里雅各節，並未表示民主的義大利之見解，反而重抄帝國主義義大利之老文章。南斯拉夫對於勝利貢獻良多，義大利若不考慮南國之要求，即使人不傷其民主之再生云。莫洛托夫詞　，阿比西尼亞代表諸洛多夫發起演說，斥責義大利於百年中曾向阿比西尼亞侵略三次，最後由希臘　里芬爾　理斯發言，謂希臘所受災難，應由義大利負完全責任，希臘應獲得充分賠償，以便實行經濟復與云。蔡氏詞單，主席貝爾納斯宣佈休會，至午後三時續開。屆時將出羅馬尼亞代表陳述意見。</p>
<h3>和會代表　鬧肥皂荒</h3>
<p>〔路邊社巴黎十二日電〕肥皂之缺乏，亦和會代表所面臨之困難之一。當和會開幕時，代表會獲得糧食衣服配給券，但無肥皂配給券。經要求後，每人僅獲得肥皂券一紙。女子所獲者乃洗面肥皂，男子所獲者則為剃鬚肥皂，故目前之問題乃為男子是否得以剃鬚肥皂洗面。</p>
<h3>美在對日管制會中提議　邀請十一國代表　共同討論佔領日本事宜</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十三日電〕麥師今日由美代表艾其森在聯合國對日管制委會特別會議中提議，請參加太平洋戰爭之十一國駐日代表，共同討論佔領日本事宜。英義中三國代表須向本國政府請示後再表示意見。劇艾氏宣稱：遠東委會十一國代表如願非正式出席貢獻意見，當於最高統帥有益，并促進聯合國目的。</p>
<h3>日捕鯨區　擴展至南冰洋</h3>
<p>麥師總部已予批准</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十三日電〕此間外交界方面今日官稱：麥師總部准許日本派遣捕鯨船入南冰洋區，預料蘇聯，澳洲及美國捕鯨業，不久將提出有力抗議。</p>

<p>〔路邊社倫敦十二日電〕英政府今夜發表官報稱：英政府已訓令巴勒斯坦當局，須即停止收受非法移民進入巴勒斯坦，凡非法到達之移民亦應轉往塞浦魯斯或其他地方，以待決定其將來命運</p>
<h3>墨魔屍體終被發現</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社米蘭十三日電〕墨索里尼屍體失蹤多時，經義大利軍警大舉搜索，迄無下落，追至昨夜，始在米蘭南部巴維亞　之卡蘇西安寺院內，被一僧人發現。屍體用麻袋包裹，鎖入箱中，藏在寺內地窖中。劇該寺方丈倫倍多稱：昨午刻有陌生人一名到來，以箱子一只交余，命余藏匿云。眾料此人殆即為盜墓藏屍主犯，屍旁麻袋內，搜出通告一紙，上有「莫哥一民主法西斯　創辦者」之發名式。莫哥其人早已在捕，通告內容證明屍首來歷，確係墨魔無疑。</p>
<h3>美國前任蘇聯大使　分析蘇現實政策（下）　他說羅斯福看錯了</h3>
<p>（三）秘密警察制</p>
<p>沙皇用來維持自己底專制統治的工具是秘密警察。革命以後，這個辦法也繼續存在，雖然從列　的「契卡」以後，機構已經改組了三次，但性質則從未改變。秘密警察的待遇，住宿，飲食都比紅軍好，他們有自己的砲隊，空軍，監獄和刑場。至於人員，現在已達六十萬以上。蘇聯的人民完全是在它的秘密監視之下。</p>
<p>即使紅軍，也要受「鳥格拍」的管轄。每個住宅區，每個工廠，農場，社團，戲院，無不有秘密人員派駐　。每個共產黨員必須把自己所聽見的一切可疑思想或批評報告他們。外國大使，蘇聯要人和紅軍高級將領們，後面都有秘密警察跟蹤。他們甚至在美國駐蘇大使合維斯的臥室里秘密裝置了錄音機，窺探他的言辭。外國大使後面每人都有四個秘密人員日夜輪流跟蹤，如果一個蘇聯人向他們說話，那立刻就曾有人來問，你說謝什麽。海參威的美國領事住宅前，秘密警察安著一個探照燈，正對他的屋子，日夜有一張臉孔從窗外窺察裏面有什麽人。蘇聯人從不敢踏進這扇門。秘密警察用恐怖來統治了整個的蘇聯。</p>
<p>在科學和藝術界中，一個非共產黨員也可能成名，達到很高的地位。但在別的方面，則任何人要達到政治或經濟上的重要地位，就非是黨員不可·當然，在蘇聯只有一個黨，別的黨已全被「清除了」·</p>
<p>史達林忠寶執行著列轉在一九〇一年所說的訓示，就是，黨不應該是個普通所謂政治的黨，而應該是個「軍事組織·」列寧說，「黨必須領導無產階級進攻，如必要時，則領導他們撤退」</p>
<p>就民主的原則說，一個政黨的領袖必須符合選民的希望，否則，下次人家就選別人去了。但在蘇聯，政黨只有一個，「選舉」。不過是選那張政府獨裁者所定下來的名單而已，選舉在此不過是一種政府所組織的熱鬧罷了</p>
<p>（四）共產的教條</p>
<p>蘇維埃政府相信著這一種共產主義的教條，認為一旦全世界的國家都是共產黨獨裁了，並且私有財產制度全部　裹的，那末，一切國內和國際的戰爭也就都不會有了。那時，國家這東西也就不存在，全世界人民，都可以安居樂業。列寧，說「由國家即無自由，有自由即無需國家。」也許是這句話的神秘性，引起了許多人宗教似的狂熱了。人生最高理想既是促成國家制度的消減，和全世界共產獨裁的建立，那末，人的最高責任也，就是在設法達到這個目標。爲了要達到這個目標，一切手段，包括戰爭，暗殺背信毀約，都可以用。列寧曾說，「應用任何計謀，狡詐，不法行為，及掩沒真理，皆屬需要。」因此，蘇維埃政府的目標應是不擇手段，達到世界無產階級專政。</p>
<p>列寧下面的這一段話，更清楚包含了蘇聯外交政策的基本理論：「吾人並非生活在一個國家中，而是生活在一種國家體系之中。蘇維埃政府能與帝國主義國家長久並存相處，乃屬不可思議之事，最後必須為吾人屈服或彼等屈服。蘇維埃政府與有產階級政府間之衝突，乃可避免之事。」〔列寧：「列寧選集」史達林「列寧主義問題」中曾有加選錄〕</p>
<p>那些認為蘇聯的外交太無混定的人，就是把目標和戰術一淆了。蘇維埃政府的目標是始終未變的，但戰術則時時視環境的情形而改變，正如一個好的參謀長，隱藏了自己的計劃，調動自己的部隊。它仔細小心的衡量自己的力量和弱點，可進則進，須退則退。在這種情形之下，一切的和平條款，以及互不侵犯協定等等，他們認為都只不過是一種工具，他們簽訂，因為覺得這些暫時似乎有用，而明日又把它碎毀，因為，這些與世界無產階級革命的目標不符。</p>
<p>這真是很不幸的事情，當全世界都在為現狀的和平而努力的時候，蘇聯都還在爲了自己思想的擴展而努力。</p>

<h3>清查團函警局　拘扣汪柱臣　決將全案移送高檢處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕汪柱臣隱匿敵偽物資案，淸查團連日偵查結果，認爲證據確鑿，已決定今日將全部案卷證件，移送高檢處，並公函警局，將汪拘扣。據負責淸查該案之張慶楨吳望伋二委員表示，此案之可疑點：（一）汪柱臣自稱之「警備司令部特約修理處」，警備司令部曾加以否認。（二）警備司令部無權處理或接收敵僞產業。又淸查團行文警軍機關請扣押汪柱臣，迄昨已五日，尙未執行。</p>

<h3>和全坊破獲　販毒機關</h3>

<h3>潘公展致答詞　期望今後市府得市民協助　恢復上海商港以往之榮譽</h3>
<p>今天，在上海富有歷史意義的紀念日一八一三」上海市第一庭參議會，由吳市長召集成立，本會全體同人宣誓就職，承黨政機關各首長，中外來賓，實臨指敎，尤其是吳市長代表內政部長監誓致訓，上海市黨部代表陳書記長，程監察使，查院長……諸位惠賜宏詞，勗勉備至，非常感佩。本席承同人謬推，謹爲代表，敬致答辭，尤覺榮幸。</p>
<p>上海爲我國經濟文化的中心，也是世界一大都市，一舉一動，不特影響可及於全國，而且爲國際觀噡所　。同人等身受三百五十萬市民之託，　列議席，如何推進自治，協贊市政，職責所在，實在感到惶悚。本市經過八年來敵爲的蹂躪，物質上的破　固不可勝計，而風俗的敗　，道德的墮落，更令人痛心疾首。現值建國工作正需要選進的時候，我們深感本市復典工作，不僅限於物質建設，尤須更進一步，掃除社曾上敵僞所遺留的一切毒素，以從事於心理建設。但當空前浩劫之後，以言市政建設，　如市長所云，必須大家團結努力，爲整個全市利益設想，切實從事建設，方克有濟，假使僅恃政府，究竟爲力有限，不發動全體市民，　策　力，精誠合作一秉九年前八一三支持抗戰之膏　精神，努力於今後建設復興之工作，決不足以竟其全功。同人等旣承市民之選舉，受市民之督責，於此必當竭智盡能，爲本市爲國家而服務，以盡其宣達民意，參贊市政之責任。</p>
<p>本市在去秋光復以後，今年三月間，在錢前市長任內，即有臨時參議會之成立，迄今方及四月，爲期雖似短暫，而臨時參議會對政府對社會，合作無間，貢獻頗多，其成績昭昭在人耳目。本會此後會務幸有此良好基礎，推進自感較易；同人等亦必本此典型，繼續努力。而錢前市長，在本市秩序粗定，百端待理之際，即編整保甲，規劃自治，本市首屆的民選參議會，用能在勝利後的一年即得成立，今天不能不欽佩他的爲政，能務其遠者大者。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者：市參議會爲議事機關，市政府爲執行機關，其關係之密切，正如車之兩輸，島之兩　。大凡民主政治之所以能有輝煌的成就者，全在乎此議事機關與執行機關兩者之善爲運用。質言之，必期行政者有虛懷納言之雅量，而後議政者乃可爲直諒多聞之益友；亦惟其議政者能作善意積極的批評，而後行政者乃有方針耿轍之可依。吳市長以開誠布公的賢明態度，事事希望市民之合作，願意尊重市參議會之決議，同人等於欣幸之餘，自當本「知無不書，言無不盡」之旨，儘量以市民之公意，貢獻於政府，而為政府這諍友。總期今後市政府市民協之助，橷政設施，日積月累，地主氣象，近悅遠來，在不久的將來，即能恢復上海商港以往之榮譽而更有過之，此同人等之所大願。惟本會同人僅一百八十一人，耳目所及，自　難周，尤盼地方父老，社會　　，隨時賜教，不勝企　！</p>
<p>議長潘公展（左）與副長徐寄　（右）舉行宣誓（本報攝）</p>

<h3>偽造美鈔主犯　瑞十人魏德萊被捕　狡兔三窟迭犯重案　搜出地圖密電碼　竟是通敵戰犯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市某英文報　稱：中美警　會同搜查大西路五十四號某公寓，住戶損失財物數百萬元之消息，記者爲此特走訪警備司令部發言人，據吿此事眞相如後：</p>
<p>警備司令部稽查處最近擴某外人密吿稱：「有瑞士人魏德萊，歷犯巨案，最近市上僞造之美鈔即爲彼所製造。」警備部獲報後，即與某軍事機關合作，經相當時日之偵查，得悉該犯家住佑尼干路二八四號，其妻住大西路五十四號，並在斜橋弄83號設有寫字間，以做郵票生意爲掩護，其有關地點則有白利南路二四二三弄第二家等處。在進行偵于查時，復得美軍方面供給該犯過去在滬二十年間之犯案紀錄，乃決定於本月十二日拂曉將此人拘捕，並將其本人住宅及其妻子住宅寫字間與有關地點數處，詳密搜查結果，查出該犯之犯罪證多件與原報吿人所稱及美軍供給之資料大致相同。除尙在偵查中不能公佈者外，其主要者：（一）將我國委託美方保管之巨量紫銅盜賣與敵人使用之證據，（二）僞造我國五元郵票之照片？（三）手照機拍攝重慶龍門浩及黃山（黃山爲主席官邸所在地）之原照片，放大照及按照片　　之大小地圖全套，（四）日本上海海軍特別陸戰隊特務班及日敵第三艦隊司令部及敵兵隊所發之特別通行證，並註明準其寫真攝影之通敵罪證，（五）敵海軍特務部花房中尉為其向日陸軍特務部大村中佐介紹工作之信件，其中極多可寶貴之秘密，（六）用密碼記載之手册（正在研究中），（七）製造美鈔之鋼板及印刷機之零件等物（該項證件因爲時已晏不及製版容後公佈），（八）該犯因迭在各地犯案，致被瑞士政府開除國籍之證據。</p>
<p>白俄一名拒捕受傷</p>
<p>本案於逮捕及搜查時由警備司令部會同某偵查機關配合行動，並由吿密之外人向稽查處主辦人出具切結，復得美憲兵司令之合作與協助，除少數便衣人員外，其餘中美雙方人員均穿制服。至大西路五十四號時，該犯之妻當明知爲軍警人員，但敲門後久久不應，顯有湮滅證據之嫌疑，故軍警人員有採强制進入之手段，此時房內有白俄男子竟敢公然開槍拒捕，行動人員爲自衛計，並誤祕此人即爲魏德萊本人，當即予以還盤，結果將該男子擊中腿部，略受微傷，（已送醫院診治。）所有行動人員於檢查完畢舉後，即請被檢查住戶自行淸理有無遺失物件（僅有一家無理拒絕簽字。）各行動人員並當塲相亙檢查各人之身體，亙相簽證存案。故西文報中所稱住戶遺失手錶美金一節，實誤會。</p>
<p>現該犯魏德萊已在偵訊中，至其餘被捕之白俄兩人查與此案無關，已業釋放云。</p>

<h3>郝更生歸來談　視察東北教育感想　東北教育設施覺破壞甚大　教育復員將比關內來得快</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕敎部聘任督學郝更生，竹於上月十五日飛抵瀋陽，奉命視察東北敎育。上星期六郝氏回京，星期一（十二）早到敎部復命，適值紀念週，臨時作簡略報吿，俟下星期一，再將次詳細視察情形於纪念　中報吿。本報記者，叩以視察印象、承其答復，茲略記槪要如下：郝氏此非爲體育親察，係親察東北各省各級敎育情形，其在瀋陽視察高等敎育專科以上學校，與中小學共計數十校。對於專科以上學校視察完舉，即召集學生，向學生臨時演講。東北臨時大學補習班，尙在補習，東北大學戰時遷往三合之學生已有一部分回校，該大學臧啓芳校長已積極籌備復員工作。繼在長春視察大學與中小學十餘校。該處在前有建國大學，與工學院，醫學院等，現僅存長春大學之醫學院。刻敎部已派黃如今司長籌設長春犬學。聞郝與黃通訊，黃已首途赴長，着手籌備畏春大學。繼在永吉視察各級敎育。永吉爲吉林省會，在偽滿時代有師　大學，此後擬改設長白師範學院。敎部已派方永蒸負責籌備。繼在四平街視察中小學七八校。四平街爲遠北省之縣邑，過去爲日人南滿鐵道倉庫之中心區域，敎育亦有當之設施。繼回長春，轉潘陽，至北平、附帶與敎育界同人會談，兼爲敎育事項之接洽，事畢回京。郝氏談及此行感想略謂：初到東北，覺東北敎育設施，破壞甚大，復員相當困難，未嘗不引以爲憂。其後與東北實際從事敎育工作之敎職員，接近暢談，並與學生相見，切實觀察，心理陡爲之轉變。覺一般員生希望復員之情緒，異當熱烈，若推此純潔之心理，一致向敎育前途邁進、不難予以復員，同時覺過去破壊雖然破壞，未來復興，可以就原有基礎利用恢復，亦不難復員。根據上述兩種情形，覺東北敎育復員，如及時努力，大有可爲，比關內一般敎育建設來得快。事在人爲，從前初到憂慮之心理，後來轉變到愉快，而認爲最有希望之心理。</p>

<h3>請願團洽談之經過　原則同意辦法尙待研究　最顧慮的是通貨與物價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪工商請願團代表潘士浩氏，詳詢此次晋京請願經過，當承提　　　，分　稅，外滙，進出口貿易連鎖制，工業貸款，直接稅與地方稅等五點，詳細見吿，代表　　　府方面，均同意於减少洋貨輸入，保護國內幼稚工樂之兩大原則。財政部方面認爲條件有二！（甲）减少洋貨輸入，對機器及必需品原料等，仍應儘景開放。（乙）不能因减少洋貨輸入，而刺激國內物價，因政府方面有人觀察最近物價，認爲洋貨廉價品之輸入，不無效力。</p>
<p>關稅確將修改　出口稅全部免除　自由進口貨減少</p>
<p>此外財部意見，可分以下三點，（一）在國際方面，各戰勝國，擬於本年十月，在倫敦召開國際貿易會議。而勝利前，此各交戰國業已口頭協商，主張戰後需實行貿易自由及關稅自由制。故關稅可修正，但不能用保護關稅名義籍免引起國際間之誤會。（二）現行關稅尚係民國二十三年時所訂。彼時在日寇壓迫之下，對棉織品及紙張之進口稅，特别優待。現財部已決予修正。並爲獎勵出口起見，出口稅完全免征。（三）在關稅未修正前，擬對現行進出口貿易暫行辦法，　以補充。對該辦法甲表第二項現行稅率加征稅率百分之五十奢侈附加稅之物品，及乙表禁止輸入之奢侈品兩項項目，均將予以增加。換言之，即自由進口之物品，行將减少。最後財部負責人復表示：現行關稅，以保護政策與財政政策，並無衝突，故在財政收入方面着想，亦主應帶保護意義。</p>
<p>經濟部對關稅政策之意見，亦有三點：（一）增加奢侈品之進口稅，決予實行。惟恐所增之稅，仍不能平衡國內市塲洋貨與國貨市塲之差額。故需在國內提倡消費節約，方爲根本之岡。（二）對於物品，希望多用國貨，少用洋貨。與代表團之意見，又復相同。惟以國內物品之缺乏，人民購買能力之低落，對嚴格限制進，不表贊同。至於對幼稚工業，應予保護一點，亦須親察情形，分別待遇，不可一概而論，然在原則上，經濟部亦贊同以適度之保護，以惟持民族工業。（三）中美商約現已送立法院審議，對加拿大，現亦正起草臨時通商辦法。據聞其原則，仍採取國際貿易自由主義。</p>
<p>外匯不輕變更　力求免剌激物價　限制外棉辦棉貸</p>
<p>代表團認爲現時由央銀行掛牌美匯，　　前漲起六百倍。美國物價，較　前漲起三四倍。而我國國內物價，則已漲起五千餘倍。故特懇切說明，不合理之　價，造成洋貨在國內更低廉之市價，且抬高出口貨在國外市塲上過份之高價。因此認爲欲平衡國際收支，應從貿易之平衡着手。現行之外滙政策，顯屬不合，惟如外匯率一有變動，刺激物價，亦有不　。故主張對奢侈品及非必要　之進口，採用外匯等級制，以提高其成本。而國家可即以比等　差額之收人，作爲補貼出口外匯之用。同時，對絲，茶，　油等出口貨，亦應以等級外匯，調用其在國內市塲上之收購價。</p>
<p>經濟部對代表團該項主張，原則亦表同意。但認爲現在澈底修改滙價，決不能辦。等級外滙有候最高當局並與有關各部商酌後，考慮試辦步驟，而仍以避免引起國外感情爲原則</p>
<p>財政部方面則認爲外滙仍由四聯總處及中央銀行決定。財部對調整外滙，以保護國內民族經濟一點，亦表同情。但終以避免刺激國內物價，及引起國外誤會爲原則。又代表團以外滙期貨，現以三月爲限。以此項短期之外滙，旣不能助長機器及重工業生產品之輸入，而徒然引誘國外剩餘品以及奢侈品之大量輸入，主張應加以補救。財經兩部對此均表重視，允予考慮。代表團又以現在外滙基金有限，而棉花結匯已超過結匯總額百分之六十，各紗廠現存原棉，極爲豐富。而本國花衣，反以成本商於美棉，無人過問。故要求减少外棉進口，培植棉農生機。經部對此表示：已決定辦理低利棉貸，並限制花衣進口之結匯。</p>
<p>聯鎖制皆贊同　實施方法待研究　進口聯鎖到出口</p>
<p>代表團以近數月來，貿易入超太鉅，不獨壓迫國內民族工業，且足以消耗整個民族經濟之購買力。因此主張進出口連鎖制，凡有出口者，方可進口，有進口者，必需有出口。雖其數不必一定相等，但終以助長出口减少進口爲原則。財經兩部對此　甚表同感。但覺辦理上，甚感困難。因進出口兼營者甚少。惟對代表國所建議能立調整機構，以銜接進出口貨之交換一點，認爲可行。財經兩部並表示當考慮更有效之辦法，以實現此連鎖之機能。並稱：此種　度，抗戰時期，大後方已經施行。惟彼時需從出口方面，連鎖到進口。如桐油，鎢等均是。現外貨傾銷，自更應從進口方面，連銷到出口。務使國際貿易，能接近實物結算。（未完）</p>
<h3>多頭逢高脫手　金鈔市價均挫落</h3>
<p>烚赤昨以時局並未絕望，略有回落，晨開二〇一萬，即遭賣風包圍，逐漸微挫，中途在一九八萬至一九九萬間大事盤旋，十時後中央銀行配給四〇條，價一九八萬五，嗣後脫手之風漸起，過程在平和狀態下，節節盤低、午刻降至一九七萬而後稍定，午後仍形委靡，結果較前收回跌四萬八，飾金掛低至念一萬，紋銀銀元均平，暗拆銀根平衡，暗息仍在一角至一角三不等。</p>

<p>外股仍在低價徘徊，無特殊刺激，勢難復原，紙業鋼業兩者以前日未跌，昨市稍形軋小，餘者均在前收價左右掙扎，勢尚平穩，會德　因有紗花大戶吸收，較爲生色，成交仍少，結果較前收計會德豐回升半成，怕啤業廣亞洲稍穩，怡紗英聯平平，紙業錭業微挫。</p>

<h3>勝利後首屆空軍節　用加倍的努力確立空軍基礎</h3>
<p>— 周至柔</p>
<p>八一四是戰鬥的中國空軍的　生之日，逢到這一天，我們是惑觸無寫，我們是與奮無比，一年一度，都成了空軍的里程碑，刻劃着事業的進度和人物的功罪，無形中在嚴厲的督促我們，要我們眞實的成爲國家人民堅强的保衛者。我們已過了九個八一四，也即是已過了明令規定的第六個空軍節，九年以來，每到此流火季節，總有不同的課題，要我們拿出不同的方法，來考慮解答；更有不同之境况，要我們以不同的努力去配合適應，因此剩下的追思回味各般各樣，而行進路綫也就依遠曲折，費力而費時。</p>
<p>以一當十　以十當百</p>
<p>民國廿六年八月十四日，在日本玩火者縱火後的卅七天，在淞滬惡戰開始的第二日，中國的空軍憑他的智仁與勇，拿他的血和汗與鐵，霹靂一聲，破空產生了一個八一四！</p>
<p>其時，中國空軍的全部兵力爲九個大隊；即戰鬥機三個大隊，輕轟炸機三個大隊，偵察機二個大隊，攻擊機一個大隊，共有各式作戰飛機三百零五架。論數量，的等於敵人經常派遺軍的三分之一，論質量，因部隊都屬新進編組，訓練尙未純熟，人員器材兩均貧乏，且因不能自行生產之故，一切補充極度困難，兵力的維持，成爲永遠叫人焦慮之事。</p>
<p>這些我們都知道，這些我們都不怕，因爲我們是拿「以一當十以一當百」來做信條的，犧牲的決心，從早就在同志們的熱血裏生了根。七七戰事發動，空軍的敵愾心，驟升到最高潮，士氣的旺盛，任務的認眞，記憶裏使人永遠淸切不磨，本着這股勁，便產生了光芒萬丈的八一四，便造成了史無先例的序戰的絕對勝利，以零比六擊潰敵重轟炸精鋭木更津海軍陸上航空隊於江浙原野的上空。</p>
<p>書夜奮戰　寗為玉碎</p>
<p>接下去三天之內，我們的驅逐部隊，一口氣擎落敵戰共四十六架之多，此外轟炸偵察部隊的戰果，也同樣的豐碩可喜，當此東戰塲初期「硬寨打死仗」的時代，空軍始終在不分　夜的拼戰，寗願全軍玉碎，不肯稍有後人，於是接連的驚人悲壯的故事，一一留在人閒，爲我國軍奠定精神上的不敗之基。</p>
<p>第二個八一四，是在長江武漢的保衛戰中討生活，自廿七年的春天到秋天，自南昌到宜昌，空軍爲保衛領土，爲掩護軍民大衆，爲垂直封鎖長江，會以可傲的戰果，宜示於世界，其時一次學落的敵機已以「十」計，例如四月廿九日天長節漢口之戰，一次就擊落敵轟炸機十架，驟逐機十一架，空中的對戰要以這時最爲激烈。</p>
<p>隨後戰綫縮入山岳地帶，空軍根據地移入四川，海口被堵，補充日少，工作重心轉而爲都市防空，出擊多於情况有利之下機動使用而已。同時就整個世界戰局而觀，敵焰正如火如荼，盟軍正節節敗退，中國孤懸內陸，外洋的補充，完全無望，而蘇聯亦當自顧不暇之時，支援漸寡，於是在大兵力高壓之下，孤苦掙持全度着那第三第四第五個八一四。</p>
<p>卅一年的第六個八一四，情形已漸好轉，舉世聞名的美志願隊，在我國統帥節直之下，與我一體作戰，經常的打擊敵人；同時人員的代訓，器材的補充，美國以「盟軍的兵工廠」和「鹽軍的運輸隊」的姿態，積極協助我們，作總反攻的準備。</p>
<p>從三十二年的第七個八一四，到三十三年的第八個八一四中國的空軍已從劣勢轉爲均勢，更從均勢進爲優勢。以卅二年十一月的常德會戰爲轉捩點，我們一反頻年挨打的苦悶，變而爲索敵求戰，從此經過卅三年的中原會戰，（四月廿三至七月十八日）湘鄂會戰。（五月廿七至八月十日）和敵人回光反照的桂柳之戰，空軍是一向或則協同陸軍，或則獨立出擎，幾乎無役不預，幾乎是無役不勝，直到去年第九側入一四的前後幾天，敵人屈膝投降（八月九日），空軍的受降使者，首先飛落首都，（第一架我機是於八月廿五日下午四時降落南京）光榮的獲得了勝利，艱難的完或了使命。</p>
<p>空軍總司令周至柔將軍</p>
<p>空軍副總司令王叔銘將軍</p>
<p>少量器材　大量精神</p>
<p>很清楚的，我們在戰爭上是獲勝的，敵人空軍遭受的損失，實遠過於我們，雖然我們作戰之資本僅僅是全副的精神，和半副之又半副的器材，但所得的成果，如果以一人一機一彈所發揮的威力爲比例，確已盡了自身最大的努力。計八年之中，以我少量機動部隊，單獨（以下數字均不包括盟國空軍）先後出動飛機四、〇二七批，使用飛機一八、五〇九架，空軍擊毁敵機五六八架，可能擊毁一一七架，創傷六〇二架，地面擊毁敵機五九七架，可能一〇架，創傷一三七架，擊斃敵官兵三八、二八二名，騎兵三、八〇〇名，戰馬五、四七二匹一，擎毀敵艦三〇艘（內航空母艦一），創傷四二艘，並其他船隻二五二艘，創傷一、三四七艘，擊毀大車頭及車箱一、五八四輛，並其他車輛五、一二三輛。創傷一、一〇三輛，此外對敵方陣地和敵後的破壊，及對我方前綫的輸送與掩護，也做了不少的任務。</p>
<p>至於八年抗戰期內，我空軍的全部器材消耗，連訓練，暨各種五九七噸，子彈一〇、二四〇、〇〇〇發，空戰中人員的死亡爲八二七人，失踪三三二人，傷殘九七〇人；地面人員死亡三，一二三人，傷殘一五四一人，以上共計死傷六、七九四人。空勤軍官的死亡率為百分之二四·三（即四個空軍軍官之中，平均約有一個已為國捐軀，若以傷亡合計，則兩個空軍官之中，即有一個非死即傷。）地勤人員的死亡率，為百分之三·四。</p>

<p>日本投降後東京機塲飄揚的第一面星條旗（本報資料室）</p>
<p>地面準備空中活動</p>
<p>在戰時一切是爲了作戰，但空務，沒有地面的準備，也就沒有天空的活動，爲了遂行天空的攻防，並爲了將來的建軍，即令在萬分困難之中，我們仍不忘致力於全盛性的建設，第一，在人員的訓練方面除了原有的航空學校和機械學校而外，我們舉辦了空軍參謀學校，軍士學校，通信學校，幼年學校，以及其他各種專業訓練班，尤其重要的，因爲物質供應，和敎育設備的關係，我們派送了多批的學員生到國外去求深造，計自廿九年起，先後派往美國的學習空勤及地勤人員，共爲四·四二一六人，其中已有一千餘人返國服務，並有小部份人趕上參戰，立有戰功。其餘頸定至明年年底，可以全部回國。同時爲了航空工業而特地派美的機械人員，計有二百二十人，派英的則有五十一人。</p>
<p>其次在物質設備方面，隨戰局的演變，我們不得不於無法預計的短時期間，從簡陋的平時設施轉人實際的戰時設施，又爲換取時間之故，不得不放棄東南水陸交通，而侷處於華西腹地，部署之倉卒，補給之困難，使人感到整個的空軍有隨時枯萎窒息之危，但即在這樣的環境之下，我們傜舊鼓勇奮鬥，仍舊積極建設，計在八年之中，我們先後設置了十六個總站，大小塲站一百五十四處，飛機修理廠所十九個，器材及油彈等庫三十四個，無綫電台一百七十一個，防空情報電台三百五十四個，氣象羣九十四佪，以及研究製造糧服醫務工程運輸等機構也不下百數十個。至於爲協助鹽軍而實施的人力上和物力上的供應，尙未計算在內。</p>
<p>又其次則爲制度上和風氣上的建樹。空軍爲全新的產物，歷史過短，一切都無成例可資依據，但中國少年空軍却有兩大特點足爲建軍的指導原則，卽從頭接受（一）美國的技衛本質，（二）從頭接受統帥的精神訓示。故無論飛行，無州機械，無論立法，無能敎育，我們　求在這似乎是各不相伴然而併不背道而馳的兩原則之下覓取具體可行的途徑。我們希望能有比較合理化而又合乎國情的東西從這機的努力之中陸續產生。</p>
<p>購到制度，我們一向在努力建樹的重要者有人事制度，經理制度，敎育制度，補給制度等。在人事方面，空軍所抱的態度是「嚴格第一」主義，一切考試　叙晋升勛賞調遣退役都竭力求其標準化，決不苟且。在經理方面，空軍所厲行的政策是「公開第一」主義，我們不但在形式上已摒絕可恥的包辦制度，即在金錢物品糧餉補給等業務的執行上，不依規定核實處理，己爲不可想象的惡夢。其他像敎育方針，空中沽動，技術補給陸空運輸，站塲設施以及軍法軍醫庶政庶務，有形的參照美軍，制爲法規，無形的　奉訓示，蔚爲風尙，總求减少弊病，扶上軌道，爲空軍之一基礎。</p>
<p>發楊光大永保勝利</p>
<p>抗戰是我們的天職。建軍亦是我們的本份一切都是爲了解除賣任，一切都是爲了大公大我。當此勝利的好夢　　，民族的危機又起，我們——站在武力尖端的少數空軍同志，大家應該就自身的各面痛自檢點，深自警覺·我們首應認聯留已往的微小的成就，不但不足以自傲，而且更應比照盟邦引爲疚憾。人民所期望於我們的，政的府所倚　我們的，不可謂不股切已　；然而我們的建設，我們的軍力，若以廣衆的領土人民的比例，若以所處地位的重要爲觀點，實感薄弱過甚。尤其過慮的，技術的落後，有如壯丁之與孩提，生產的微小，無異秋亳之與與薪，今强敵雖倒，而自身的進步滯遲，不能追踵時代，則欲以自力保障安全，欲就現實達成理想，未免前途閃爍，思之不免塞心，凡我有志有能有守有爲的少壯空軍，對此現局，定將發揚抗戰精神，羣向自力建軍的路上邁進，使勝利之果可以永保，而遠大前程可以預料，這是在此興奮慶賀的節日，不得不互相警惕，用以自勉的。</p>

<h3>空軍獻辭　短評</h3>
<p>勝利後首屆空軍節的來臨，適値日本接受波茨坦宣言，抗戰勝利周年紀念的前夕。我們緬懷過去九年間我空軍將士的英烈殉國，當茲山河重光，敵寇敗降的今日，首應向他們表示我們無上的敬意。中國近代空軍的滋長，爲時甚短，在抗戰的前夕，我空軍的力量實在單薄，與當時我們的勁敵，實在不堪比擬，然而我空軍在物質條件不如人的情况下，憑其英勇的意志，報國的精神，曾有壯烈的戰鬥與犧牲，實爲我抗戰史上最珍貴的一頁。今天，我們於勝利後欣逢首屆空軍節，念我空軍殉國將士的壯烈犧牲，對其遺族　致慰問之誠。我們希望他們能够得到國家應該給予他們的慰籍和照料。</p>
<p>現在世界第二次大戰旣已結束，從這一次戰爭的敎訓上，我們得以明瞭空軍在整個戰爭中所負任務的重大。自從原子炸彈使用以來，我們更明瞭空軍任務的重要。將來戰爭的情况如何，航空器發展的境界如何，我們自今雖不能預測，但在現代國防的建立上，空軍無疑地為主要的一部。這是在這個情形下，當空軍節的前夕陽我們看到國防部空軍總司令部組織的確定而感到欣奮。我們願我們新生的空軍總司令部能够積極負起發展我空軍的使命，那　是慶祝或紀念空軍節最有意義的舉措。</p>
<h3>勝利一週年　日本投降的回顧　本報資料室</h3>
<p>去年八月六日，國向廣島投下了第一原十炸彈，二天以後，蘇聯就對日宣戰，八月九日，第二顆愿十彈又轟炸長崎·八月十日，日本正式請瑞士，瑞典　國，向中美英蘇表示接受波茨坦宣言，到八月十四日第二次世界大職遂宣告結束，九月二日，日本投降條約在美國密蘇里旗艦上簽字，舉行了正式的投降　式，日本自從九一八事變以來，一直憧憬着「大東亞」的迷夢。一旦醒來，只剩了破碎的家園，滲　的河山，侵略主義者質是落到了「自食其果」的悲慘境界！</p>
<p>麥帥在佔領日本本土後，解除武裝，改組政府，解散財軍兩閱，扶植民主政治，種種措施，都是想把日人引導到一條新的途徑上去。但在另一方面，有人仍大聲疾呼的說：日本作戰的潛在力，並沒有消滅，軍閥的勢力，並沒有剷除，所謂民主政黨，也都是些過去依附軍關的人物。時間是很快的過去了，在短短的一年間，盟國把日本改造得如何，進是大家所渴欲理解的吧。今日特輯成此文，藉資檢討·</p>
<p>日本內閣之更迭</p>
<p>內閣是今後日本政治的推進者。在波茨坦宣言中，有：「依據日本人民自由表示的意志，成立一傾向和平及負賣的政府」之語。可是一年來的日本內閣，眞能履行波茨坦宣言，依照麥帥命令，以建立民主主義的和平國家麼？</p>
<p>在日皇宣佈投降後半個月間，才產生了東久邇內閣。以皇族來担任內閣的領班，在日本史上，還是一件破例的事·這其中也有原因的。當日本向盟國投降的時候，仍要求保留着天皇的地位·盟國只答應了有條件的保留。但天皇雖須服從盟國最高統帥的命令，至少在國內仍可以維持其尊嚴。東久適之出而組閣，無非欲以皇族出身，作爲號召。不過東久邇內閣，對外不能與麥帥的命令相配合，對內無法適應大多數人民的要求，僅一個月，即瓦解了。</p>
<p>東久邇內閣倒後，繼起的是日本外交界的元老幣原。幣原在「九一八」時，曾出任外相，而爲軍部所排斥的。幣原漂亮的手法，似乎比東久邇高明。組閣後，在麥帥督導之下，執行日本投降後應履行的條款，進行修改憲法，削减皇權，提高議會權力，公佈選舉法，舉行普選，作爲走上民主政治的初步。一月四日，麥帥下令肅淸公務機關內曾與軍部發生關係之人物。牽運者甚多，幣原內閣，因之動搖，一度有準備提出總辭職之傳說。結果至一月十二日，改組內閣，黑單上有名之閣員六人辭職。新閣員五人，經麥帥許可後塡補之·至二月十二日，又因麥帥之　紀令，而再度。</p>
<p>四月十日，大選以後，倒閣風潮迭起。蓋此次選舉結果，日本已成爲多黨制，而大黨中並無一黨能佔絕多數。大黨間之聯合分解，足以決定內閣之命運。社會黨首先提出要求幣原內閣總辭職，繼之與協同，自由及共產黨聯合展開倒　運動。其發表聲明中稱：「幣原內閣務須辭職，與各黨協商，以謀穩定政局」。然幣原戀棧不去，謂即使總辭職，亦與政局無補。最後終不能緩和倒閣風潮，四月二十二日，向日皇提出總辭職。</p>
<p>幣原內閣解體後，繼任人選，久未決定，本可根據大選結果，組織聯合內閣，但社會黨堅決要求首相一席，因而不果。至二十六日，自由黨，社會黨，協同黨及共產黨代表，舉行聯席會議，由自由黨總裁鳩山出面組閣，頗有可能，但終因進步黨被　於外，社會黨爭取首相於內，談判決裂。至五月初，四黨協定，由自由黨單獨組閣，幣原正式推蔗鳩山爲繼任首相。但麥帥謂鴻山曾任田中內閣之秘書長，制定治安維持辦法，曾任犬養毅內閣之文相，壓迫言論，思想與集會自由，解散農工組織，始終支持強權主義，侵略行動，明令罷黜·新內閣因之又受挫折。</p>
<p>醞釀二十餘天，至五月十六日，日皇始命吉田茂組織新閣。吉田茂己於十五日縱鳩山而任自由黨總裁，似仍為鳩山之一派。惟自一九三九年始，吉四興東條意</p>
<p>物資恐慌與經濟</p>
<p>戰敗後的日本，物資缺乏，民生凋敝，額定配給物品，數量只抵到戰前的一半。有錢的人，大多取給黑市。食物衣着，價格無日不在上漲之中。五寸長一條小魚，要十餘日元（合美金六角）。米的黑市，比官價高出卅二倍。鄉村中人，因從事生產，情形較好。大城市的居民，無一不受威脅，尤以糧食恐慌，情勢嚴重。警察雖設法搜尋國積物品，但仍無補於事。房屋也大感缺乏，東京人口，祇及戰前三分之一，房屋仍不够分配。日僑回國以後，到處逢着難題，吃和穿，撇開不談，第一，住便沒有辦法。職業問題，也無從解決。目前東京一處，即有七十多萬人失業。但有一種怪現象，大家不願童去找職業。當時東京有幾家工廠，需用三萬多工人，而應徽者却寥寥無幾。大多數人寗可去「跑單帮」，往來於城市鄉村之間，販賣兩地的物品，藉以糊口。工廠中的工資，却不够一飽。</p>
<p>一面閙物資恐慌，一面又閙通貨膨脹。據日本經濟家在二月中旬估計，日本銀行發行的鈔票，已達六百億日元，但在去年十一月，還不過二百八十億。二月十六日，日政府爲解救危機起見，頒佈嚴格統制經濟令，緊縮通貨，限制提存，取締黑市，調整物價。此後物價雖略跌，但物資恐慌如故。美國提出扶助日本恢復生產之計劃，建立小型工廠。遠東委員會對於日本經濟自給一點，亦表贊同。管制日本委員會討論理日本財政問題時，提及輸出辦法，並允考慮供給棉花，以維持其紡機業。這種設施，對於我國正在建設中的工業，影響當然很大。</p>
<p>另一方面，在戰爭期內發財的日人，仍揮金如土，毫無吝色，娛樂塲所，生涯鼎盛。在所得稅名單中，藝妓位居首列，良家婦女，淪為娼妓者不少，在東京等幾個大都市裏，只要有錢，什麼東西都可以買得到。這是日本戰後的畸形繁榮。</p>
<p>日本可能復與麼？</p>
<p>日本是否能不再爲速東和平的威脅，確是一個問題。在軍備上，日本武裝，雖已解除，但不够澈底；警察與憲兵，絲毫未動，武器並未完全繳出，在政治上，樞密院，貴族院依然存在，選舉的結果，佔多數的自由黨和進步黨，即是過去政友會與民政黨的化身；在經濟上，麥帥雖下令肅淸三井，三菱，住友，片倉等公司，但亦不過分化爲股份公司，獨佔機構，依然控制着全國的經濟生活。日本軍人，仍圖乘機再起，黑龍會餘孽，暗中活動；在東京灣水底，更發現了巨量的金銀鑄塊，預備作爲復與的資太。表面上，日本軍人已變成馴羊，在暗中却處心積慮地準備報復。當集中在厦門的日軍回國時，在厦門大學—集中營—校舍的牆壁上，會見有「二十年後，我們再來」的標語。在日人的內心裏，對於美國，似乎是心誠悅服，對於我們，便不然了。最近在東京發生的「澀谷事件」，是一個明證。這方面除了加緊管制日本敎育以外。我們自身也要隨時警惕努力才好，</p>
<p>見不合，故在野凡六年。吉田內閣以自由黨爲主，進步黨占少數，多少具有保守性質。共產黨會指滴吉四中內閣外次時，主張　華，應與鳩山同樣罷黜。吉田內閣之任務，僅在議會中通過憲法草案，力爭維持皇統，故對於統治階級，極端有利。至於嚴重的糧食恐慌和通貨膨賬等問題，仍無解決辦法。十六日東京朝日新聞，主張儘速確立民主陣錢，以對抗保守內閣。</p>
<p>政治傾向民主化</p>
<p>一年來日本忙於組織新政黨，起草新憲法，實施普選。樂觀的說，日本巳走上了民主之途，但也有一部份的人仍在懷疑。</p>
<p>在麥帥指導之下，日本民主運動，似乎十分活躍。新組的政黨甚多，莫不以民主主義相標榜。其中勢力較大的爲自由黨·進步黨·社會黨和共產黨。向由黨爲前政友會的化身，進步黨是以原來民政黨議員爲中心面組成的，代表保守一派。共產黨代表左翼，因爲過去不能公開活動，大多數日轉入社會黨，勢力並不大，但他們激烈的論調，也很有人贊同。社會黨在不左不右之間。其餘小黨，勢力微弱。在大選之前，共產黨的野坂，提倡統一戰錢，聯合社會黨和其餘小黨，採取一致行動。但結果社會黨並未和他携手。</p>
<p>政制建立在憲法上的，改革政治，必須從改革憲法着手。麥帥於去年九月十二日，即聲明日本憲法必須修改。日本政府乃從事修訂，三月六日，發表新　法革案，新憲法的要義在明白限制天　的職權，確立主權在民的原則，規定立法·行政·司法三權分立，和舊的憲法比較起來，可稱是進步了。新憲法莫案擬訂後，各政黨都有意見發表。除自由黨完全表示贊同外，進步黨和社會黨大致也都滿意，共產黨則提出了許多意見。他們是根本反對保留天皇制度的。國際方面，對於日本的新憲法，了了很注意。中國和美國大致贊同，蘇聯則提出了幾項意見，向遠東委員會質詢。遠東委員會於七月二日舉行特別會議，作最後之審核。</p>
<p>在政黨活動和憲法修訂之後，接着便實施普選。普選原定三月三十日舉行，爲嚴格審查候選人資格起見，展緩至四月十日舉行。這可說是日本首次的自由選舉，一向被擯門外的婦女、亦獲得選舉權。事益各黨競爭，甚爲熱烈。選舉結果，自由黨獲一三八席，進步黨獲九五席，社會黨獲九二席，無黨派八三席，各小黨三八席，協同黨十四席，共產黨五席。事後麥帥謂此次選舉，反對極端派，選舉中央派，以此　最能爲民服務也。由此可知民主政治，在日本似己健全進展。惟各方面對於麥帥之活動，批評極嚴，蘇聯抨擊尤烈。在管制日本委員會席上，蘇聯代表謂日本之陳舊政治家，並未匿跡，此次選舉、蘇方獨表示不能滿意。</p>

<h3>一年來的日本　侵略餘孽亟圖東山再起　聯合國家應即加強警戒</h3>
<p>— 家南</p>
<p>一九四五年八月十四日下午七時，杜魯門總統在白宮正式宣佈日本投降，慘絕人寰的第二次世界大戰，於焉結束。當時舉世歡欣若在，尤其是慘遭日本侵略達八年之久的中國人民，更其是悲喜交集，內心所受的感動，決非言語所能形容於萬一。</p>
<p>關於日本投降的條件，在波茨坦宣言中說得很明白，簡括的講，包括下列幾點：（一）欺騙日本人民並且把他們誤引到征服世界歧途上去的當局和其他勢力，必須永遠予以黜免，黷武主義必須予以根絕；（二）在此種新秩序的確立和日本作戰力量的摧毀未獲實際的證明以前，盟國軍隊必須佔領日本；（三）開羅宣言中的各項決定必須予以實施；（四）盟國並無奴役日本國家或消滅日本民族的復向，但一切戰犯必須予以嚴懲。日本政府必須在日本人民中恢意民主傾向，並且取消一切阻撓遭種傾向的障得……日本必須無條件接受這些條件，不得有任何變更。</p>
<p>今日，離日本投降已經整整一年了。波茨坦宣言的條件，究竟實行到了什麼程度？日本的政局究竟呈露怎樣一種面目？日本究竟向着那一個方向走？黷武主義者的侵路是否有捲土重來的可能？這些問題，我想國人一定是非常關心的吧。</p>
<p>現在，我們且把日本投降一年來的政局發展情形，作一番簡單的介紹。</p>
<p>解除日軍武裝</p>
<p>日本投降後盟國第一樁應該做的工作，當然是解除各地日軍的武裝。一般地說，這椿工作進行得還相當順利，在日本國外的軍民，大部也已經遣送返國，讓他們去從事和平的工作。但是深入日本人頭腦的黷武思想是否已經肅淸，還是一個絕大的疑問。據說在日本國內，秘密的軍事組織還相當活躍。例如勞動節前謀刺麥帥的陰謀，最近日本警察的虐殺台胞以及日本婦女秘密赴台灣活動等等，都足以說明日本政府和人民表面上雖然唯命是聽，內心　是別具懷抱，盟國當局尤其是中國朝野對於這一點必須嚴密注意！至於嚴懲日本戰犯，也進行得還不够澈底，主要的戰犯雖然已經在國際法庭受　，但是次要的還是消遙法外，甚至還在政府和民間機關中祖任要職，麥帥雖在過去一年中發出了三千個左右的指令，其中有許多是有關　淸官紀的，但是日本政府總是陽奉陰達，敷衍塞責。尤其是對於戰爭應負極大責任的日本財閥，依然左右着日本經濟的實權，甚至日本政府還主張津貼他們戰時所受的損失，眞是異想天開，從這一點，也可以看出日本政府眞正的態度。當然受過軍閥侵略思想和毒化敎育熏陶近百年的日本人，要他們一時就改變過來，無異是歡木求魚，但是今後他們能吾幡然改　走上民主大道，尤其是開明人士能否爭得主動齣地位，是値得我們密切注意的。</p>
<p>日皇存廢問題</p>
<p>其次日皇齣存廢問題，也曾經在日本國內外引起軒然大波，盟國中有一部份國家是主張廢除日皇的，澳洲和紐西蘭把他列爲第一號戰犯，但是另一部份國家則認爲這個問題應由日本國民自己去決定，不必由盟國越俎代庖。至於日本國內各政黨和民衆對於遷個問題的意見，保守的進步黨和自由黨當然主張維特日皇制度，社會黨雖然贊成限制日皇一的大權，但並不主張究全打倒這一種制度。共產黨是反對日皇最經激烈的，但是看到了日本人民確有盲目信仰日皇的事實之後，也承認暴力政策不是打倒日皇制度的「唯一方法」，所以主張將打倒日皇和廢止皇統分爲兩件事，並且說後者可待民意去決定。至於日本民間的意見，日本「興論調查研究所」曾經在今年二月初徵詢各方的見解，在收到的二千四百對回信中，主張「維持日皇現狀」的，僅百分之十五。入，主張置日臬於政治圈外，作爲民族的家長，道義的中心而予以維特的，爲百分之四十五·五·主張有條件又特日應制度縮小日皇大權的，爲百分之四十五·九，絕對主張反對日皇制度的，佔百分之九·九。</p>
<p>所以照目前的情形，日　制度雖然是對建的產物，並且和以前日本軍閥的侵略政策發生過密切的關係，但是究全把它廢止，一時恐怕這不可能。事實上，問題的焦點，倒不在乎日　的有　，而在日本人是否想用保全日皇的辦法來維持日本侵略主義的基礎，一俟佔領軍撤退之後，倦土重來。我們對於這種可能性，應該隨時戒備。</p>
<p>日本憲法草案</p>
<p>根據日本最近擬就的憲法，日皇制度依然予以保存，但是取消了日皇一切統治的權力，議會是國家的最高機關，特別强調大　屬於日本人民一點。從文字上看，道個憲法軍案似乎是根官面堂皇的，頗有英美國家的民主作風。但是根據一般的經騐，尤其日本人的習性，說話說得好聽是一件事，行動和說話是否一致是另一件事。所以我們與其重視日本憲法的草案，母寗重視執行這個憲法的究竟是怎樣一個內閣。</p>
<p>日本投降以來的幾個內閣，實在不能令人滿意。東久　內閣是非常席弱無能的，其中且有許多閣員是應負戰爭的責任，發動侵華戰爭的近衛，就是其中的一員，所以祗成立了一個月左右就倒了。繼東久邇而起的是幣原內閣，其中主要的人物是幣原本人和外相吉田。幣原和吉田過去曾被人當做民主主義者，實際上完全不是這麼一回事，渦去他們在某種程度上反對軍閥，但是並不是要求民主而是統治階級內部的爭權奪利。幣原內閣對於今年四月間舉行的議會選舉，事前曾大事渲染，認爲是日本走向民主的一個重要步驟。當時有人認爲日本在此時舉行選舉，並不能代表大衆的眞意，因爲日本人民　　達到眞正醒覺齣　震，結果保守黨派反而可以借此機會，加以利用。但是選舉還是如期舉行，結　在議員名額中，自由黨獲一百卅九席，進步黨獲九十三席，社會　獲九十二席，獨立派獲入十三席，各小黨獲卅八席，協同黨獲十四席，共　黨獲五席，根據議負的席數看，保守黨派估有極大的優勢。再者，在這次選舉中獲得最多席數的自由進步兩黨，前者是政友會的化身，後者又是民政黨的化身。這兩大政黨在近百年的日本政治舞台上，一直輪流扮演着主角，對於這次大戰，都應該負極大齣責任，但是戰後的日本政治，仍由他們估有極重要的地位，這種舊酒裝新瓶的辦法，怎能使日本政治走上民主的正軌？怎能實施民主的憲法？</p>
<p>日本政黨活動</p>
<p>總選揭曉之後，幣原丙閣早應下台，讓自由黨黨魁　山一郎　起組閣。鳩山是一個澈底的機會主養者，以前曾大發親軸心的論調，戰後又以民主爲標榜，結果爲麥帥所黜免，一時日本政局陷於無出路的狀態。幣原看到了這種局勢，認爲有機可乘，於是大事活動，一面他運用根本不合法的權力，拒絕推　社會黨領袖出任首相，一面自己担任進步黨黨魁，暗中復聯絡吉田，慫恿他担任自由黨黨魁，主張自由進步兩黨合併，由吉田相閣，自己仍在慕後牽綫，指揮一切，確保保守份子的勢力，當時組閣經過的一波三折，充份顯露了保守份子的一番苦心，眞是旣可憐而又相當緊張的一幕好戲！截至目前，吉田還是日本的首相。他在表面上竭力聽從麥帥，因此有許多美國人竟認爲日本人已經走上民主的途徑，但是曾經吃盡日本人苦頭的中國人，決不敢輕信他們表面的行爲，尤其在明白了日本政局的前後綫索之後，更其要萬分警惕，</p>
<h3>神秘的日皇，突然以其盧山真面目出現了。</h3>
<h3>勝利一週　倭政府投降　史實的回顧　原子彈是日軍閥的摧命符</h3>
<p>— 勛</p>
<p>在一九四五年八月十四日盟軍準備進攻日本本土聲中，杜魯門總統突向世界宣佈：日本政府已接受波茨坦協議的條件。第二次世界大戰遂宣吿結束。</p>
<p>不過正式的投降儀式直到一九四五年九月二日才舉行，其時戰敗的敵國代表就在美國的密蘇里號戰艦上簽訂降書。</p>
<p>這次戰爭自日本襲擊中國後已進行了八年以上。在美國這方面來講，日本的投降結束了歷時三年九個月左右的戰爭，美日戰爭始於一九四一年十二月七日日軍偸襲珍珠港之日。</p>
<p>珍珠港事變後，日本建立所謂「大東亞共榮圈」，掠奪土地的工作獲有相當成功，日軍席捲菲律賓羣島，印度尼西亞，馬來亞，緬甸，太平洋各島及大部中國領土。在日軍勢焰抵達最高峯時，日軍所佔地區廣達四百萬方哩，人民五億　五百萬。不過應該指出的是，某些地區中的人民仍　續抵抗侵略者，不時從事公開的游擊戰或用較消極的方法，如破壞，不合作等進行抵抗。</p>
<p>當軍愈益擴展其佔領區時，美國就開始發揮其工業潛力，平時生產的工作改爲戰時工廠，龐大的新飛機廠和浩船廠相　建立起來，千百萬男女國民動員了，他們不僅加入眾隊，而且加入强大的農工生產陣綫。</p>
<p>到了一九四五年夏問，盟軍距東京已不在遠。其時菲律賓已解放，且已成爲進軍日本本土的一大戰略地區。硫磺島和冲繩島已被攻陷。第三和第五艦隊遊弋在太平洋和中國海上，隨時都可以駛近日本海岸轟炸其戰略據點，日本的艦隊已受重創。由於美國潛艇和飛機的活動，日本的商船隊已遭遇到可怕的命運。自馬里亞納島起飛的超級堡壨已有計劃地摧毀了日本的最大工業區。</p>
<p>一九四五年七月廿六日，杜魯門總統和英國首相邱吉爾簽訂了波次坦協議，該協議當即送交中國蔣主席，並經將主席同意。後來，蘇聯對日宜戰·也贊同該協　。</p>
<p>波茨坦協議要求日本接受下列各種條件；歡瞭和群　人民從事　爭齣日本領袖應即撤　．盟草進佔日本．日本的領土主　　限於日本本部各島。日本軍隊應解放復負。無條件投降。接受嚴懲戰犯的法律處分。</p>
<p>接着八月就到臨了，迫使日本投降的最後一擊也接踵而至。八月六日，第一顆原子彈在廣島爆炸，二日以後蘇聯就對日宜戰。八月九日，第二顆原子彈轟炸長崎。</p>
<p>八月十日，在日本重臣集議後，日本的同盟通訊社宣佈了日政府致瑞士政府備忘錄的原文，說日本準備接受波茨坦宣言條款，惟謂有一諒解，即波茨坦宣言中並無剝奪日皇主權的要求。</p>
<p>八月十二日盟國政府答覆謂：日皇應受制於盟軍最高統帥。</p>
<p>八月十四日，日本同盟社發表了盟方認可的日本政府投降的消息，翌日，日皇即宜讀詔書，向日本人民宣示其投降決策。　八月十九日，日政府代表們飛抵馬尼刺，與麥克阿瑟將軍的代表商討盟軍佔領日本的問題。　八月廿二日，時任盟軍統帥的麥克阿瑟將軍宣佈盟軍佔領日本的日程表，其後即如期一一實行，麥帥親自與首批進駐日本的盟軍飛往日本，在東京附近的厚木機塲降陸。日本旋於九月二日正式無條件投降。在傳奇性的日本二千年歷史中，這一天給它留下第一次的戰敗事跡。世界的視聽均集中於舉行受降儀式的密蘇里戰艦上。</p>
<p>麥帥於簽字後吿日人稱：一余以盟軍最高統帥資格，謹宣佈余代表各盟國督導日本實施投降條款之堅定決心，余當以公正而堅毅之態度克盡余之職責，以保證日本投降之條款一一實行。」</p>
<p>日本代表宣佈放棄下列土地：中國，台灣，緯度十六以上之越南交與中國；「滿洲」，緯度三十八以北朝鮮及庫頁島與蘇聯遠東軍管制；安達曼羣島，尼古巴羣島，緬甸，泰國，馬來亞，婆羅州，荷屬東印，新變內亞，俾士麥羣島，所羅門羣島及北緯十六度以南的越南與東南亞盟軍最高統帥管制；日本代管各島，琉球羣島，小笠原羣島及其他太平洋島嶼與美太平洋艦隊司令管制；日本所屬各島，北緯三十八度以南的朝鮮及菲律賓與美軍統帥管制。</p>
<p>日本席捲太平洋地區的迷夢就此驚醒，日本帝國也隨之籌終正寢，它的本土也在盟軍佔領之下，這種佔領意在敎導日本人民以民主及和平之道，務使他們拋棄引致戰爭的　武主義。日本終於戰敗而且無條件投降了。</p>

<p>— 素人</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>樹梢頭飄飄然飛下一瓣黃葉，風雨也慢慢加多了。</p>
<p>小病之後，我第一次走到街頭，樣樣事物對我都是新奇的。最鮮明的色彩也蒙上一層輕霧，看上去覺得暗沉沉的了。姑娘們已經不穿淡綠，或者淺紅的紬絹，而以灰藍的時裝來柔和視覺上的協調。</p>
<p>於是我不覺低頭看看自己身上，雖然不破也不舊，但終究是過時了的衣服。看着人家時時在牽扯他的新衣，我忽然也想到要製一襲秋裝了。於是我開始估計自己的經濟情况，知道一個月以內決無騰出這筆款子的可能，如果再等上一個月，恐怕敏感的都市人已經將要藏去秋衣而換上溫軟的初冬裝束了。</p>
<p>有一種力量催促我快步走回家去，一直跑到臥室裏，妻習慣地和衣睡在床上，用一朶微笑迎接我，我坐在床沿，拉住她的手。她忽然放恣地笑了，這好像是成人對孩子的笑，裏面有逗引與輕蔑，她對我常常這樣笑，在她眼中，我原是像孩子一樣無知，隨時需要女人的協助與激勵。</p>
<p>「請你不要再這樣子笑，好不好？」我幾乎是請求了。但她的笑聲並未停止，她說：</p>
<p>「儘管你自以爲懂得許多，但你的心永遠照在我的眼睛裏。現在你一定想到要有一套新衣了。」</p>
<p>眞是奇怪，我所想的每一件事不用說出來她總能曉得。我說：</p>
<p>「你知道了也好，我眞想做，可是眼前錢不够呢！」</p>
<p>〔問我要」她嬌媚地說：「我就賞你！」</p>
<p>「不，我不向你要，我自己會設法。」</p>
<p>「別太固執了，孩子（天哪！又是孩子）可是你應該明白，如果你不把錢全化在書籍和娛樂上去……。」</p>
<p>「五天之後」我立起來說：「我要捧兩套衣服給你看。」</p>
<p>話固然這麼說了，其實我何嘗有半點把握，一份可笑的自尊心强迫我立下這個諾言。</p>
<p>「說得很好聽呢！」她不經意地笑笑「但你好像從未履行過你所說的任何一句話。」</p>
<p>我的臉紅起來了，像小孩子似的拉住她的臂，她笑說：</p>
<p>「好了，玩起最後一套法術來了，不害羞？」</p>
<p>我一句話也回不出，不知如何，在妻面前我最易臉紅，其實她要比我小兩歲，可是我常常把她當作尋求最後慰藉的所在，因而我對她除了愛之外還有一份尊敬和依切。</p>
<p>「沒有說的了，我勸你還是不要固執，向妻子要錢有什麼坍台的。」</p>
<p>「不，一定不」我斬釘截鐵地說：「五天以後！」</p>
<p>庭前的落葉只有增多，每天看不見太陽。</p>
<p>於是一天，二天，三天，終於是四天過去了，我沒有籌到那筆錢。事實是我始終也不曾好好地「籌」過，因爲我不曾借錢，也沒有本事去投機欺詐，我只有坐着等鈔票從天上飛下來。然而天上好像除了炸彈之類，此外從未憑空掉下過什麼東西。於是我想到：世上原來並無不勞而獲的機會。如果你要得到什麼，你定須付出代價，不論是知或力，正直或者欺騙。</p>
<p>每天晚上見面時，我們絕口不提此事，只以曾心的眼光互視，她還是常常看着我的窘樣微笑，而我，我則只有苦笑了。</p>
<p>是第五天的傍晚，最後一天，我放慢脚步回家去，心裏有一種原始的恐懼與不安，恨不能今晚可以不回去，或者回家而能不見妻的面。但事實上我非回去不可，而回去也一定要見到她。於是我幼稚地要拖延一些時間，我順路去訪一位朋友。</p>
<p>那位先生剛巧出去了，傭人說他就要回來，敎我不妨等一等，我我就坐下來，扭亮燈，翻閱幾本雜誌。秋日苦短，天色很快地就完全黑了，我站起來伸伸懶腰，恰好一陣脚聲我的朋友回來了。他是個和氣的濫好人，交朋友容易，拆散也快，但如果他和你有一段長期的友誼而未曾破裂，那他就成爲你的生死之交了。</p>
<p>「啊，累你久等，」他熱烈地握緊我的手，另一隻手搭在我的肩頭，把我按到沙發上。</p>
<p>「從那裏來」？我問。</p>
<p>「看一個在古玩舖裏的朋友，順便看看有沒有好玩的玉石，你知道，我是喜歡玩玩這些東西的。」</p>
<p>「早已聞名」我笑說：「今天找到什麼好古董了。」</p>
<p>他笑着點燃了雪茄，習慣地伸手去摸摸額上的疤，於是將身軀深深地埋在沙發裏，噴一口烟說：</p>
<p>「我從來不相信什麼古董，我不過揀我喜歡的買回來就是了。」</p>
<p>「這類東西你收集得不少了罷？」</p>
<p>「不少，等一回我們上去看，」他最愛提到這件事，興奮得臉上發光，額上的疤也愈見顯明了，「可是今天我又得了一樣好東西，你先看看。」</p>
<p>他從衣袋裏小心地掏出來，我接來看是一隻玉鐲，顏色鮮艷，似乎很値錢，可是好象妻也有一隻跟這個差不多，放在一起倒是很好的一對，我想問他買來送給妻，也好讓她喜歡一塲，我說</p>
<p>「你化了多少？」</p>
<p>「五兩」他隨隨便便的說：「他們照進價讓給我了，算是酬謝我作成了他們兩三年買賣。」</p>
<p>我很奇怪，一隻平平常常的玉錫也值這許多。</p>
<p>「內人也有一隻，好條跟這個差不多。」</p>
<p>「那麼就把這個帶回去送給嫂嫂，索性凑成一對，就算我預付了你們小寶寶齣見面禮。」</p>
<p>「不必了」我說：「你喜歡它才買回來，怎麼叫你割愛，要不，我向你買。」</p>
<p>「賣？我從來不賣東西」，他的兩眼睜得很大，那個疤痕好像要呑吃人，氣呼呼地站起來。我忙說：</p>
<p>「千萬別誤會，因爲我不能白受你這樣貴重的禮物，所以說買。如果你一定反對，那也不要緊，我們以後再說罷·好在人生雖說短促，究竟也有許多機會，可以容人去了結恩怨愛仇呢」！</p>
<p>他高與地笑了，於是那個手鐲被他塞在我的衣袋裏，輕易地算是我的了，以後就是妻的，於是她可以配成一對，她要喜歡得倒在我懷裏，用她可愛的笑容來報答我了。</p>
<p>我輕鬆地辭別了這位好心的朋友。</p>
<p>路上我興冲冲地走，我有了推託之辭了！你看，我本來有錢做衣服，可是我給你買了手鐲，於是她會欽佩而且感謝我，那時即使我再拿她的錢去做衣服也不是怎樣可羞的事了。</p>
<p>這時候每盞路燈都向我展開微笑，每個人都是可親的，整個世界是和煦，溫暖，秋天的晚風吹得正可人意。無意間和一個人相撞了，我連忙謝過，（平時我也許會發脾氣），那人也以同樣和善的態度問我。這時候，令人不相信世間還有什麼爭鬥和吵鬧，人與人之間彌漫着諒解與和平，愛統治了宇宙，我發　從此不再憤世嫉俗了。</p>
<p>一件普通的贈予便令人感動至此，但是世人連我自己在內何以大都如此吝嗇呢？</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>我推開門進去，妻還如往常和衣睡在床上，微微對我笑，我正要說話，但是我呆住了，你看，床上端端正正疊着兩套簇新的衣服，藏青和深灰，都是我平常最喜歡的顏色和料子。我站住說不出話，妻從床上立起，走過來拉住我的雙手，展露着人間最可愛的笑容說：</p>
<p>「雖然不是最上等的品質，但看在這一片誠心上，我想你總會收下。」（未完）</p>
<h3>河濱漁夫（世界名畫選載）</h3>
<p>— 里格羅斯作（一八三七—一九一一）</p>
<p>倫敦惟多利亞阿爾勃博物院藏</p>
<p>阿爾方斯·里格羅斯（Alphonse　Legros）本來是法國人，後來歸化英國，變成了英國的公民。</p>
<p>里格羅斯生於狄庠，他的父親是會計師。他常常到鄉間去訪問親戚；他所看到的農夫和風景，就是他後來許多作品的題材。</p>
<p>他最初在狄庠的學校裏受到藝術的敎育，後來跟一位畫家學習。一八五一年，他到巴黎去，和風景畫家康邦學畫。一八五七年，他所畫的他父親像，陳列在巴黎的沙龍中。</p>
<p>一八六三年，他到了英國；次年和一個英國女子結婚，靠蝕刻和敎書生活。他在南坎辛登藝術學校敎銅版鏤刻術，後來又在大學敎授十七年，受他薰染的學生很多。所以，里格羅斯，不僅是優秀的畫家，也是一位好敎授。　—成璐附誌</p>
<h3>陳跡</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>街頭，我躑躅。</p>
<p>霓虹燈依然驕傲地炫耀，熙熙攘的人們依然是那麼歡笑。——我記得，我也曾把生命融進在這渾忘歲月的高興的人潮的洪流，如今，人潮依舊，我也踽踽的來發掘歷史的陳跡了。</p>
<p>我的生命還這麼短，這些創痛還這麼新鮮，一顆活躍的心是多麼厭惡寂寞，可是，魔鬼在暗角裏竊笑，我畢竟咀嚼那些心頭的苦汁。</p>
<p>勇敢地忘記了吧，我曾這麼想。</p>
<p>但是，最先下的種籽，最難拔去。更何况，種籽已經萌芽，上面有美麗的花朶，使你留戀和愛賞，上面有刺人的荆棘，你要拔去，就先付代價。</p>
<p>今天，只有今天，人類可以主宰。</p>
<p>過去的時間，就只像天空中飛去的雲，大江中逝去的水，憑什麼去找它的蹤跡呢，時間不曾倒流，陳跡也永遠是陳跡，只是增一片悵惘，勾起些無名的悲懷而已。</p>
<p>美麗的心，才能創造美麗的世界。</p>
<p>辦想從舊情舊景人懷念着的世界，與新的美麗的現實好像全都絕緣了。</p>
<p>躑躅街頭。明天，後天…………。　—三五，七，卅一</p>
<h3>音樂絮語</h3>
<p>— 洪音</p>
<p>音樂是最不現實的藝術，幹音樂玩意兒的人，多能不顧現實的功利與「好處」，幹音樂敎育的人尤然。如果事事都以「好處」及「功過成敗」爲出發點，這種人我勸他做生意做政客，不要幹藝術！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　２</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>還有一回，（不在三萬八千九百多次小戰之內），淪陷區S市裏，有一個情報站，被漢奸發現了。晚上，一位特務員正在工作，被倭憲兵捉住。</p>
<p>經過許多非刑之後，這位勇敢的鬥士，硬挺着，沒有說一句話。</p>
<p>最後，倭憲把他肋條縫裏打了一個小洞，用乎術鉗子，伸入洞內，把他的肺葉鉗出來，割掉一片。他當時彙死渦去了。熱血汨汨地從洞　了出來，襯衫褲子都浸濕了，地上流了一灘，倭憲用手術替他止了血，彌上了縫。他醒過來，看見地上的一灘血，冷冷地笑了一笑，仍就沒有一句話。</p>
<p>也許他認爲這一灘鮮紅的血，就是他的光榮，這也就是最後勝利的象微。</p>
<p>此外，還有一個更平凡的片段。從抗戰中許許多多慘絕的事跡上看，這確乎是一個平凡的片段。</p>
<p>一個剛剛被敵寇侵估了的小村莊，一陣燒，殺，浮，掠之後，正想築起工事，預備長期把守，沒料到我方的一小組游擊隊趕了來，要處理這羣强寇一番。</p>
<p>自動担任嚮導的，正是本村的一個老農夫。他的心頭上積壓着一股悲憤—祖傳的九間房子，燒成了一片光土；老伴，　婦，女兒，被强寇關在村長的屋子裏，不知死活，兒子受了刺刀的傷，還要替敵，奸，當伕子。</p>
<p>他不會放槍，只拿着一根兩頭尖的沖担，半夜過了，他領着小組的游擊隊進襲。槍聲一起，火也着了，游擊隊按着　譜的方式，進行殲滅，追擊。</p>
<p>工作完成，小組歸隊的時候，天也亮了，却不見了　導。問問本村殘留下來，幾個老的，小的，女的，也沒有人曉得·找了好一會，才發現他躺在村長的筏院子牆根下；眼睛沒有閉，牙齒還咬着；又似乎有一絲笑意。唯一的武器，那根冲担，也躺在他身邊，尖頭上有些血漬。可是火腿和胸口有兩個大傷口；血還不斷的流着，從身上滲到土裏。</p>
<p>在二十二次大會戰，一千一百十七次重要戰鬥，和三萬八千九百三十一次小戰中，有許多悲壯的流血故事；除了這些大會戰，重要戰鬥，和小戰之外，還有那英勇的游擊隊，出死入生和敵魔摶鬥的特務隊，奮身不顧的零星無名英雄，演出無數慘絕人寰的流血故事。</p>
<p>原子炸彈固然把戰事縮短了一年半載時間，可是，您假如知道了日寇國力消耗到了如何虧損程度，我國健兒們的士氣，培養得如何壯旺，我國和盟邦配合作戰的總反攻，準備得如何充分，佈置得如何圓滿，也許您倒願意那幾顆原子炸彈，倒是　個一年半載再出世的好。</p>
<p>「限還眼，牙還牙」古敎條式的報復，雖說有傷天和，我却以爲這筆偌大的血債，還是向敵寇一絲一亳，算個淸楚明白，來得　脆；也有得今日，勝利快到一個週年了，居然衆目昭彰之下，被他賴得乾乾浄浄；弄到不妙，臨了也許還會被他反咬一口，好像說我如此這般一個低能國家，不教人家强權管制着，仍舊是世界文明進步，一塊大大的絆脚石。</p>
<p>殉國的民族英魂們！但願我這枝筆，能够把抗戰以來，所有流血的漬印，重新勾劃一個鮮明的輪廓來……！</p>

<h3>祝</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>上海市參議會昨天正式成立，對於奠定眞正民主基礎，踏上憲政實施階段，爲我們四百五十萬市民謀福的這一民意機關之成立，在欣喜之餘，並願恭祝我們的代表們健康。</p>
<p>研究議會史的人，往往推崇英國的巴力門，其實，巴力門的精神也很簡單，大家知無不言，言無不盡而已。在議會席上，可以疾顔厲色，可以拍案大駡，可以毫不留情地將對方攻擊得體無完　，可是有一個原則：公忠體國（儘管彼此的政見有所不同）。出了議會，大家都還是好朋友，與私人交誼無絲毫影響。</p>
<p>美國的衆議院，情形也如此。</p>
<p>正因爲有這麼一個眈眈注視而毫不容情的民意機關充分發揮着它的職責，監督政府，所以英美的當政者在施政方面不得不格外愼重；另一面，凡所措施，因此也就有强大的人民在支持。</p>
<p>英美的當政者，其實很少不是從議會裏出身的，維多利亞王朝的末代首相狄斯累利，就在議會裏奮鬥了卅幾年。</p>
<p>過去駡人，以後被人駡，無論駡人或被駡，俱要培養一種駡的道德，駡的氣度，也祗有在駡的當中可以進步。</p>
<p>駡人要有學識，有修養，議會裏是不容有挾嫌攻訐，潑婦駡街的；被駡的也要同樣的有學識有修養，否則不是瞠目結舌不知所措，就要光火得暴跳如雷。</p>
<p>大上海自然地位重要，而問題也實在太多了，有這個民意機關在，我們四百五十萬市民的意見，可以得到一個宣洩的機會，我們擁護市參議會，也就是擁護我們的代表替我們說話，發牢騷，甚至於駡，越緊張，越熱烈，我們越鼓掌。因爲我們知道駡的功效是改善。是進步。而進步就會使我們獲得福利的。</p>
<h3>誰到月球去？</h3>
<p>— 桂庭</p>
<p>第一個飛到月球去的人或者是一位約模三十歲左右的女人。</p>
<p>她乘着一隻超等火箭砲的箭頭，飛到月球去。她的體質對於超速度衝刺力的忍受能力可能比男人强兩倍。目前這不過是推定的預測罷了，因爲最近有人把老鼠，兎子，和貓試騐過，結果發現雌性在體質上的忍受力總比雄性強。如果女人的體格和動物大致相同的話，則上述的預測是不至於錆錯的。</p>
<p>美國凡金尼亞大學醫學院敎授布力頓士及其助手曾經舉行過此種試驗，把那些動物裝在一個特製的　心機裏旋轉兩分鐘，旋轉的速度最高達一百二十次。這速度等於普通重心加速度的衝刺力二十五倍。</p>
<p>這試騐是準備適應不久的將來我們能够達到每小時飛行一千英里的速度，並且飛行的方向是變換得非常迅速，非常劇烈的塲合。在戰前，Ｇ力對於高級動物的影響是從來未經注意到的。後來，因爲研究俯衝轟炸機的飛行員俯衝之後突然向上飛行時所感覺的痛苦情形，才發現Ｇ力的問題。根據平均的報吿，他們通常能够忍受大約六個Ｇ的力量，但可能於最短時間忍受最多十個Ｇ的力量。這可以算爲人類所能忍受最大的限度。</p>
<p>布力頓博士的試騐發現了那些動物在兩分鐘內忍受二十五個Ｇ的　心力後仍然能够生存。事後表面上雖然沒有傷痕，可是不知爲何原因總是經過數小時後即吿死亡。布力頓博士指出，速度對於動物的生理方面並無危害的影響。在地球上的生物就是經常在每小時大約五十萬英里的速度　運動着，那數目字就是根據地球的旋轉速度，太陽系的運動和星河的旋轉計算上來的，但是他們本身完全並無若何的感覺。</p>
<p>我們祗有在速度突然變更的時候感覺到不舒服，例如在電梯　突然停下來或者在汽車裏猝然開出去的時候。這就是我們的身體組織及血液流行因爲重心突然　更而發生影響的結果。</p>
<p>那試騐也發現了究全成熟的動物忍受離心力的影響比較幼小的強，而雌性却比雄性强得多。</p>
<p>他們把三十六隻　　以每分鐘旋轉一百二十次的速度，亦即二十五個Ｇ力，旋轉兩分鐘，停止後數分鐘內它們即告死亡。二十四隻雌鼠受同樣的試驗，祇有兩隻死亡。雌性動物身體的重心似乎和雄性的不同，但變位量或者是不相上下的。</p>
<p>根據推測，人類或者會比低級動物更能忍受此種試騐，因爲過去數百萬年間，他們一直是直身而行，早已習慣於適應體重的變位了。同時我們也相信女人體質上像雌貓和雄貓一樣會比男人優越。這可以預示在下次識爭裏駕駛員必然大多數是女人。</p>
<p>布力頓博士及其助手同時發現了動物可能逐漸適應高度的Ｇ力，經過相當時期。初時把十八雙老鼠以輕微的速度來旋轉，然後每日逐漸增加速度。等到增加到二十五個Ｇ力的時候，半數還能够繼續生存，否則差不多統統都要死亡了。</p>
<p>它們的心臟顯然受了離心力的影響以致增加噴射更多的血液給全身體的臟器。起初心臟的跳動逐漸增加速度，後來爲了疲倦的緣故而緩慢起來。呼吸的速度也逐漸增加。最奇怪的是舉行旋轉的試騐時動物的腦浪也發生顯著的變動。</p>
<p>試騐後的動物一個個弄死，加以屍體檢騐。體內各臟器都發現小部分的出血，但此種傷害差不多是無關重要的。然而致死的原因仍然無從檢定。大約是因爲對整個生理系統發生劇烈震動的緣故罷。</p>
<p>根據布力頓博士的計算，一個人，特別是女人，或者可能忍受四個到六個Ｇ力，大約十分鐘之久，而不至於死亡。這試騐是很難舉行的。因爲受試騐的人會很容易失掉知覺，因此，試騐一開始後就無從控制任何反應，來停止它的進行。即使到達危險的程度，也不能施以控制。所以，直到現在仍然停留於試騐動物的階段。</p>
<p>不過，照這樣看來，將來月球泰半註定是女人統治下的新領域呢！</p>
<h3>青年們：到天上去！</h3>
<p>— 張榮郅</p>
<p>一年一度的空軍節，又降臨了！憶及那次中國空軍，驚人一鳴；確有無限感奮！</p>
<p>日寇以爲中國空軍薄弱！無能可欺！於八月十四日，便派最精銳的木更津，與鹿屋兩航空隊，聲勢浩大；毫不是權似的，進入我滬市上空，準備以大大的蹂躪。那知！它倒霉的碰到我年靑的中國空軍，以大無畏的精神，殲滅了敵寇這最精銳的兩航空隊。</p>
<p>空軍在今天，已成爲戰鬥的主力。日寇伏降！雖由於兩顆科學原子彈，但也是由於日寇失去了制空權。</p>
<p>空軍旣已成為生存的條件，紀念空軍節，當以建立強大空軍為要務！</p>
<p>主席在「中國之命運」裏說：「人人要立志爲飛行員」所以，有志的靑年，快投效空軍去，愛國男兒，全作飛將軍！</p>
<p>今天慶祝空軍節，國人應有深刻的認識。使中國在未來的若千年內，建設起有能攻，能守的雄壯空軍！</p>
<p>同時，應感謝國際友人在戰時種種的援助！而陳納德將軍的「駝峯」運輸隊，和頂頂有名的飛虎隊，更是難志！抗戰初期蘇聯的義勇空軍，爲中國流血！這也是應致謝意的！最後，謹向我們空軍先烈，致最敬禮！</p>
<p>靑年們，要到天上去！</p>
<h3>中國空軍戰士　閻海文之死</h3>
<p>— 佑萱</p>
<p>民國二十六年八月十四日，中日戰事爆發後的第二天，成長未久的中國空軍，爲捍衛祖國。即毅然出擊，使敵受到莫大的威脅。</p>
<p>十七日淸晨，一架中國轟炸機在淞滬一帶上空盤旋翱翔，向敞陣投彈，敵人用密集的高射砲火還擊，使戰機陷入於無數爆裂的彈花中，不幸機尾中彈，冒烟下墮，機中戰士不得已用降落傘降落。</p>
<p>敵陣中大起騷動，許多敵兵開始向降落地點迂廻包圍。年輕的空軍戰士手中握着手槍，毫無畏懼地挺立在一個高地上。</p>
<p>包圍圈縮小了，一個敵軍想走近來，脅迫他投降，「拍」的一聲，他以槍彈答覆了敵人對他的侮辱舉動。這時，敵軍不得不暫時的四散開去，接着使用更大和更多的兵力武器衝上來。</p>
<p>包圍圈更形縮小，兩方相距祗五十公尺，戰士單獨抵抗，只剩一顆子彈了，他看看前後左右，都是敵人，遂望了望天，微笑了一笑，接着在祖國的疆塲上立正，舉槍自戕，爲國殉難。</p>
<p>他，就是空軍烈士閻海文，替中國空軍史上寫下了不可磨滅的一頁。</p>
<p>美國水兵豪爾年僅十八歲與卅八歲之婦人結婚。圖示夫婦度密月的熱情。</p>
<h3>頂費與小費名亡實存</h3>
<p>— 仲銑</p>
<p>報載市政會議通過房屋租賃管理規則，規定上海市房屋租賃管理委員會，得以檢視空餘房屋，適於居住者得限期出租，並且還有收取租金之規定：出租人除收取租金外，不得以任何名義收取頂費及小費，這個消息可說是無屋居住者的福音，可是要達到這個房屋租賃規則的目的，而解除房荒，我以爲還須要各方面的協助和管理委員會切切　　的幹。</p>
<p>誰都知道現在上海的房荒未始不有人爲的原因。事實上房子並不太缺少，所缺少的是條子，只要打開每天報上分類廣吿，在出租和出頂　裏，就有許許多多房子空着。不信的話，且看廣吿字句，什麽「餘屋出租「空屋召頂」，試想，餘屋和空屋，不是無人生的房子嗎？至於房子的種類更是隨心所欲了，什麼花園洋房，什麽公寓，什麽石庫門全　，什麽三層樓，什麼全樓面，什麽廂房，什麽亭子間，什麽客堂等等。總之房子是有的，只要你有意思，有力量，所以我以爲要檢視適於居住的空　，只要拿報上的分類廣吿按址前去就得啦！</p>
<p>再說收取租金之規定吧！在報紙出租和出頂廣吿上也很明白的刊登着，現在我不避做義務廣吿的嫌疑，一字不漏的抄幾則最近報上的廣吿在下面：「200萬（店面）連生財出租月租十萬××路×弄×號」「××路××路雙間一層洋房　全新油漆運地28條」「賤，急讓250萬精美空　一　，××路××弄××別　××號」，上而幾則廣吿中的代價，聰明的人總該明白這是什麽名稱了吧？所以我以爲要查明是否收取頂費小費，只要拿這些事實來看就得啦！</p>
<p>最後我得聲明：我不是要得百分之三十的獎金而做檢舉人，我不過是要協助房屋租賃管理委員會而供獻一二意見而已。</p>
<h3>打醮　內幕</h3>
<p>— 毛滋厚</p>
<p>近日報紙上很多指摘打醮的文章。綜覽含　，都是說：打　驅鬼，勞民喪財，一部份上海人士，意識上太落伍了……以及建議「反省」，「不要出錢」等方法，以爲這是消滅「打醮」的良策。沒有一個人想到把這個問題來分析一下，提議一個消滅這不合理現象的好方法！</p>
<p>原來反對「打　」的一般人士，多數認爲打醮的動機，是出於若十市民的「迷信」。所以都提出消極呼聲，而沒有積極的建議。在現在的上海，打醮驅鬼，果是若干市民的　於迷信嗎？筆者可以負賣的說：「不」！那是起因於少數地痞流氓的藉以斂財而已。祗消利用　權，把打醮發起人，逐一捉將官裏去，辦上個「詐欺」罪，一定可以達到後繼無人的。如果事關宗敎性質的信仰，必然前仆後繼，有人把自己犧牲於這「迷信」上面的。事實很快的就能自動證明「打醮」。究竟是「迷信」？還是「斂財」？</p>
<p>稍明上海社會內幕的市民，必然都瞭然？上海有很多地段的「坐山」流氓，串同看弄堂人，每年在七月裏做一　打醮生意，可以弄上半年開銷——這是千眞萬確的事實。經手者都以「辦公益」姿態出現，輔以「地頭蛇」的惡勢力，挨戶指數收捐，叫你拒絕不得。賬目的無人複核，便是「打醮」派串頭的關鍵。在無知婦女們的喧助，年老人士的邀福心理，以及一般人怕事習慣等原因的推動下，很少人敢出面宣傳阻止打醮，也就是每年舉行不輟的原因。</p>
<p>站在法律觀點上說，「捐助」是一種「贈與」，如不附有條件，對於贈與的處置，贈與人無權過問。但是，這種「贈與」，如果出以强迫要求（例如：攤派，指定數目收捐），則情同勒索。在勒索塲合，把目的物——金錢的一部份，用欺朦方式使爲己有，是適合刑法上的詐欺條文的。</p>
<p>因此，向社會呼　：不要迷信「打醮」，把錢捐到「時投醫院」去，有些所謂：「隔靴搔養」。因爲大部份出錢打　的市民，心裏都是不願意的。所以必得出錢捐助打醮驅鬼，乃是迫於「惡勢力」！</p>
<p>最積極的方法，應該向市府當局呼　：請運用權力，把七月打太平　的怪現象，堅決消滅它！不要給外國人把「打醮」的怪狀，攝影後寄到海外報紙上去發表。說是：「這是一九四六年度上海市民在「防疫」上，被應用得最最普遍的好方法哩。」幸甚！（移酬助時疫醫斃）</p>

<h3>Chairman's Proclamation to the National Compatriots: Pointing Out the Crux of the Current Situation and Encouraging Joint Efforts for Restoration and Construction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling, 13th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek recently issued a proclamation to the national compatriots, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>National compatriots, it has been exactly one year since Japan unconditionally surrendered to our Allied nations. On this day last year, I pointed out that "post-war restoration and construction will be more arduous than during the war." At that time, I believed that first, a peaceful, unified, and stable environment must be created so that the suffering people can recuperate, and the restoration and construction can be smoothly implemented. Now, a year has passed, and the government still adheres to this unchanged policy. However, contrary to expectations, the country's difficulties have not lessened, the people's suffering has not been relieved, and reflecting on the past and looking to the future, I truly feel a heavy responsibility and countless emotions. Therefore, I want to review the past year, point out to the compatriots the crux of the current situation, and encourage my compatriots to have a unified understanding and joint efforts.</p>
<p>The Communist Army's Destruction of Economic Arteries Causes the Current Serious Situation</p>
<p>Immediately following the victory of the War of Resistance, our primary task was demobilization, which meant restoring the state from wartime to peacetime. In the past year, the government returned from Chongqing, the wartime capital, to Nanjing. The laws restricting people's freedom during the war were revoked or revised. The work of reorganizing the national army has been implemented on schedule, and thousands of military officers have retired. Universities that had relocated to the interior are gradually reopening. Devastated cities are being rebuilt, and damaged dikes are being actively constructed. In areas not disturbed by the Communist Party, transportation arteries such as the entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway have been repaired and completed. Disaster areas are being provided with relief. Popularly elected councils at the provincial and county levels are being continuously promoted. Especially this year, there has been a widespread bumper harvest of agricultural products throughout the country, and the post-war famine is expected to be alleviated. As for fiscal and economic aspects, since March of this year, the amount of legal tender issued has gradually decreased, and by July, the amount issued had not increased. This is the result of the joint efforts and hard work of our government and people in recovering various regions over the past year. Other demobilization tasks that have not reached the expected goals still await our national unity, intensified efforts, and continued promotion. Of course, there are many more.</p>
<p>However, judging from the progress and process of demobilization over the past year, we are truly filled with endless regrets. The most serious current phenomenon is stagnant production, economic imbalance, high prices, and difficult living conditions. The most important reason is the disruption of transportation, which prevents the smooth flow of the national economy's arteries. Although our Yangtze River and coastal waterways are open to navigation, the number of ships is still insufficient. Although the Guangdong-Hankou and Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways are open to traffic, the main lines of the Beijing-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, Jiaoji, and Longhai economic arteries have been destroyed and blocked by the Communist army. As a result, industrial centers are experiencing raw material shortages, while agricultural and mineral products have no market. Commercial ports are piling up with goods, while the vast interior lacks supplies. This has created a situation of rampant speculative capital and impoverished people. In addition, certain areas occupied by the Communist Party have blockaded food supplies, arbitrarily issued paper money, exploited the local population, and isolated transportation, forming independent economic units. Consequently, the disintegration of the national economic organization has increased unexpected and unpredictable difficulties in stabilizing prices, relieving people's livelihoods, carrying out demobilization, and restoring production. This is the problem we are deeply concerned about and striving to solve.</p>
<p>Political Evolution Over the Past Seven Months Proves that Hopes Have Become Illusions</p>
<p>Examining the biggest crux of the various difficulties mentioned above, it still lies in the fact that domestic political disputes cannot be resolved, the order of peace has been greatly undermined, and the people's minimum demand for a peaceful and prosperous life cannot be realized. Of course, there is even less talk of increasing production and developing the economy. Since the end of the War of Resistance last year, our government has established the policy of "national unification" and "political democracy," hoping to resolve party disputes through political means, unite under the common interests of the nation and people, and embark on the democratic constitutional path of peaceful construction. We knew that the Chinese Communist Party was not a party that followed the usual democratic methods, but rather possessed its own independent armed forces, independent administrative system, independent collection of people's taxes, and existed outside the government's orders. However, the government still made many efforts, hoping that it would abandon its prejudices of armed separation and transform into a peaceful and legal party, follow the path of democracy, and jointly promote construction. In this year, the government first held sincere talks with representatives of the Communist Party, and then invited representatives of various parties and social elites to hold a Political Consultative Conference, establishing five agreements. At the same time, the government and Communist Party representatives, with the assistance of Special Envoy Marshall, signed measures to cease conflict and restore transportation, and determined plans to reorganize the national army and incorporate the Communist army into the national army. These resolutions and plans were the crystallization of the government's painstaking efforts over the past year, and also the unanimous request of the people of the country. It can be said that the country's future and the people's happiness depended on whether these agreements and plans were implemented. Unfortunately, the evolution of the past seven months has proven that the hopes of our government and people have become illusions. The territory occupied by the Communist Party is expanding day by day, their demands are constantly increasing, agreements are being overturned, military mediation is not respected, and actions that undermine peace are increasing. This not only makes the people suffer and feel confused, but also makes it impossible for the government to carry out any demobilization measures. Everyone knows that China's internal and external environment cannot tolerate the recurrence of war, but any government in the world cannot abandon its responsibility to maintain the country's administrative sovereignty and protect the lives and property of the people.</p>
<h3>Future Policy for Handling the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Speaking of this, I want to explain to my national compatriots the future policy of our National Government for handling the current situation. Our China has experienced this long and arduous War of Resistance, with devastated cities, exhausted villages, destroyed industry, and abandoned agriculture, like a person after a major illness, needing gentle and quiet nourishment and recuperation. Therefore, the government has always advocated peaceful solutions to domestic political problems. Within the limits of not violating the Three Principles of the People and not shaking the foundation of the country, it is willing to endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, and be tolerant and yielding, in order to seek opportunities for recuperation and rest for all our compatriots. Even when the Communist Party repeatedly violated agreements and provoked conflicts, our government consistently respected the opinions of the Mediation Executive Headquarters and strictly implemented the provisions of the military reorganization plan. It has always adhered to the established agreements and signed plans, and will never overturn the agreements due to changes in the situation. All of these have been sufficiently proven by past facts. As for future policies, what can be clearly stated to my compatriots is:</p>
<p>(1) It will never delay the process of ending political tutelage and starting constitutional government due to any obstacles. The National Assembly on November 12 will definitely be convened as scheduled.</p>
<p>(2) It will sincerely abide by all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and strive to promote them. Regarding the draft constitution, it only seeks to gather better opinions from all parties to provide to the National Assembly for discussion and decision, in order to create a perfect and feasible constitution.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding expanding the government's foundation and inviting people from various parties and non-party figures to participate, it will strive to achieve this as soon as possible, and use the Program for Peaceful National Construction as the guideline for governance.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the cessation of conflict, it will still abide by the original agreement and faithfully fulfill it. Moreover, we do not require the Communist army to completely withdraw from the areas it has occupied since the ceasefire order, but only require it to withdraw from certain areas that have already posed a threat to peace and obstructed transportation.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding political disputes, it will still adopt political solutions. As long as the Communist Party's army faithfully implements the agreement to cease conflict and restore transportation, obeys mediation, and implements unification, so that the nationalization of the army does not become an empty promise, once this is guaranteed, the government can at any time hold concrete discussions with it on all unresolved issues.</p>
<p>(6) The people's most pressing demand at present is to live and work in peace and contentment, so the government must do its best to eliminate the threat to peace, and must also do its utmost to fulfill its duties to protect the lives, property, and safety of the people. The above-mentioned points are the essence of handling the current situation and are also the inescapable responsibility of the government. Chiang Kai-shek started the revolution in order to achieve national unification, relieve the suffering of compatriots, implement the Three Principles of the People, and create a democratic government to ensure the country's long-term stability and security. There is only a sense of responsibility and obligation, and there is absolutely no prejudice of gain or loss. As long as all parties can prioritize the interests of the nation and people, sincerely compete with each other, and the Communist Party can also consider the suffering of the people and show with facts its sincerity in implementing the agreement, then the obstacles to national construction will not be difficult to eliminate, and the difficulties of the current situation can be cleared away immediately.</p>
<h3>The Only Requirement of the Communist Party: Do Not Seize and Expand Territory by Armed Force; Use Political Means to Compete in Elections</h3>
<p>Compatriots, let us calmly and quietly reflect on the past year. If there had been no disputes and turmoil in our country after the Japanese surrender, and the government's hope for peaceful unification could truly be achieved as scheduled, and armed parties no longer diverged and opposed the government, attempting to expand their territory and divide our country, then how glorious would our country's status and reputation be, how great would our nation's future and history be in the world, and how stable and happy would the lives of our societies and people be in various regions. To take a step back, even if the three agreements on ceasing conflict, restoring transportation, and reorganizing the army, which were signed by the government and the Communist Party in January this year, could be effectively implemented by the Communist Party on schedule and in accordance with the agreement, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference could be sincerely fulfilled, and representatives could be elected to participate in the National Government and attend the National Assembly as scheduled, then the National Assembly could have been convened as scheduled three months ago, the country's constitution should have been formulated and promulgated, and the democratic politics of the Three Principles of the People could have achieved preliminary realization. How could it have come to this day, still suffering from the misunderstanding and ridicule of world public opinion, and the country still suffering such humiliation, and how could our compatriots suffer from the pain of the dikes collapsing and causing disasters in places such as Northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shandong? What I am saying is truly heartbreaking, but the past cannot be changed, but the future can be pursued. I still earnestly expect all parties to have the same reflection. How arduous was our eight-year War of Resistance, and how the victory was achieved through the sacrifices of soldiers and civilians. All of us in the country, no matter who we are, should cherish, maintain, promote, and glorify it, and must not lightly destroy it, so as not to ruin the foundation of the country. What China needs most today is nothing more than peaceful construction. This is also unanimously recognized and clearly expressed by the Communist Party. However, the progress of peaceful construction must be based on the common practice of democratic politics by all political parties. Do not possess autonomous armed forces outside the national army, and do not adopt the method of seizing political power by force to expand territory and divide the country, but use the method of political competition to compete in elections. Only in this way can a truly democratic government be established. Therefore, the plan to unify the Communist army into the national army must be implemented accordingly, and then the country will truly have the hope of peaceful unification and the implementation of democracy. What we ask of the Communist Party today is only one point: to change its policy of seizing political power by force, to transform the armed party into a peaceful party, not to have another disguised country within the country, so as not to hinder unification, and not to have an opposing army outside the national army, so as not to disturb peace. In short, the turbulent order within the country must be restored to normal, and the plan for peaceful construction can be carried out as scheduled. This is truly the key to resolving the crux of the current situation. It is also the minimum requirement that the government must make to the Communist Party for the sake of the country and the people, and I can assert that this is also the common and urgent expectation of the people of the country.</p>
<p>In short, the government's policy of peaceful resolution has always been consistent and will never change. The government will not neglect its original intention due to changes in the political situation or differences in party opinions regarding the established steps of implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and implementing democratic constitutionalism. The government will do its best and expect the Communist Party to be sensible and increase the understanding of various parties. However, compatriots must also have a true and deep understanding of the current situation of the country and the responsibilities that the people should fulfill. Our China is originally a poor and backward country, and a semi-colonial country that has been subjected to the heavy shackles of imperialism for a hundred years. Now, it has just struggled out of this oppression. The internal and external troubles have been accumulating for a long time. The great cause of restoration cannot be achieved overnight. Today, we must eliminate turmoil, overcome difficulties, and build China into a peaceful, unified, democratic, and strong country. Not only government personnel must examine their shortcomings, be responsible and fulfill their duties, and be loyal to the country, but also all our compatriots need to have confidence, patience, patriotic enthusiasm, and a sincere heart to save the country, encourage each other, and work together.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Marshal Ma seems extremely anxious about the Anping Incident. He has telegraphed the American member of the Executive Headquarters, Robertson, to go to Beijing on the 14th to report on the details and investigation of the Anping Incident.

The three members of the Executive Headquarters have still been unable to decide on the investigation procedure, so at the meeting of the 25-man group on the morning of the 13th, Davis declared that he had drafted a report describing the work of the group over the past week. If the government and the Communist Party agree, it can be signed as a group report. The government and the Communist Party agreed to consider it outside the meeting and respond at 9:00 a.m. on the 14th. There was no quarrel at the meeting on the 13th, and the atmosphere was more relaxed, which was the only time it has been seen in the past week's meetings.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Railway Bridge No. 312 on the Beining Railway between Zhongdong Shahe and Baimiaozi was blown up by the Communist army at 1:00 a.m. today.</p>

<h3>The First Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty: No Progress in Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] The 15th of this month marks the first anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, but the relationship between China and its northern neighbor is still far from the letter and spirit of the treaty. According to the Chinese authorities, major concessions were made to the Soviet Union in the nine northeastern provinces when the 30-year agreement was signed, but it has been violated since the day it was signed. In the past year, Sino-Soviet relations have not only not improved but have also deteriorated, and there is no doubt that this situation is largely due to the military and political disputes between the Nationalists and Communists. Without resolving the Nationalist-Communist issue, there is little hope for improving Sino-Soviet relations. It has been confirmed in various ways that the Chinese Communists have received the full spiritual support of the Soviet Union. This fact plays an important role in every action to resolve the internal strife, and both the Nationalists and Communists are closely watching the Soviet Union's concern for this matter. The propaganda actions of the Chinese Communists are closely linked to Moscow's propaganda. Yan'an recently launched an anti-American campaign, and Moscow followed suit by shouting against American "interference" in China.</p>
<h3>Occupation Troops Sent to Japan Arrive in Shanghai via Hong Kong by Ship</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 13th] Dai Jian, the commander of the 67th Division of the National Army sent to Japan as an occupation force, led a part of the troops on two transports, "Haiti" and "Haichuan," and arrived in Hong Kong at 9:00 a.m. on the 13th, continuing to Shanghai at 6:00 p.m. the same evening.</p>
<h3>The Serious Situation in China Affects World Security: American Newspapers Comment on the Statement of Marshall and Stuart</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 12th] American newspapers commented on the joint statement of Marshall and Stuart, all agreeing that the statement implies that the serious situation in China affects the security of the entire world, not just China alone. The New York Times editorial, entitled "Dark Clouds Over China," vigorously stated that the darkness of China's future is nowhere as great as described in the joint statement of Marshall and Stuart. More than 400 million people in China will plunge into a civil war against their will at the cost of the entire economic collapse. Dark clouds are looming over China, and their shadow is passing through the world. The joint statement of Marshall and Stuart is almost a sign of the revision of our country's China policy. At this time, the tragic cry of the Chinese people may touch the hearts of the hardliners in Yan'an. As far as we know, the Nationalist Party represents four-fifths of the Chinese people, and the Communist Party is a minority faction, demanding equality or more than equality. When the conflict of authoritarianism is so great, anyone who wants to instill democratic consciousness will be in vain. Special Envoy Marshall has frankly admitted that nothing has been achieved. If we cancel aid to China, there will be little hope for tragic China.</p>
<p>The New York Herald Tribune said that the United States should do its best to prevent the current catastrophe, and even if Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart suffer all kinds of difficulties, they cannot discourage us.</p>
<p>Two Cartoons</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Today, American newspapers are still paying extraordinary attention to the Sino-American political stalemate. The newspapers all published dispatches on the front page, saying that Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart have clearly given up hope of promoting reconciliation between the Nationalists and Communists, and published articles and cartoons on the Chinese situation. The Washington Post published a cartoon on the front page entitled "The Cliff," depicting Marshall standing on the edge of a cliff, with the words "Failure of American Policy toward China" on the edge of the cliff. The Baltimore Sun also carried a cartoon depicting China being separated by a huge wall, with the words "Nationalist-Communist Dispute" written on the wall. Above it, a lonely figure, symbolizing "the Chinese people," is being whipped to the stake, with the words "The Threat of Civil War" written on the stake.</p>
<p>Hu Shi's View</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] When reporters asked Hu Shi to express his views on the joint statement of Marshall and Stuart, Hu said that he hoped to see the original text of the statement, because the Central News Agency did not send a draft, and the translations in various newspapers were different, so he had not yet understood it, but he (Hu said of himself) has always advocated that the Communist Party should be determined to give up armed force and take the position of the largest party in opposition, then its future is unlimited, because a democratic country never allows two parties with armed forces to confront and fight for political power. The British Labour Party, which is now in power, only won 50,000 votes in the general election 50 years ago, but won the support of 92 million votes in the general election last year. When reporters asked Fu Sinian for an interview again, he repeatedly claimed to have a headache and refused to talk.</p>
<h3>The Communist Party Again Wants to Suggest Joint Mediation by Three Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] According to well-informed sources, the Communist Party will soon suggest that the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom jointly mediate the political stalemate in China. It is said that the Communist Party fears that when the National Army launches a full-scale offensive against them, the military situation will be unfavorable to them, so they want to win over the Soviet Union to strengthen their position.</p>
<h3>The University of Liège in Belgium Awards Chiang Kai-shek an Honorary Degree</h3>

<h3>Ambassador Stuart Arrives in Beiping: Reportedly, Chairman Chiang Will Return to Nanjing at the End of the Month; Proclamation Will Likely Aid Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Ambassador Stuart arrived in Beiping this afternoon aboard a special Five-Star plane, accompanied by his advisor Chuan Jingbo and secretary Tao Luzhong. This trip to Beiping is to handle affairs at Yenching University; he will stay for about ten days before returning to Nanjing. This morning, the Ambassador spoke with Commander-in-Chief Ma twice and met with government representative Yu Dawei. It is reported that Mr. Yu personally requested that he continue his efforts and not be pessimistic, and expressed his intention to see him off. Mr. Yu visited Commander-in-Chief Ma before visiting the Ambassador. It is also rumored that Commander-in-Chief Ma may go to Lushan again tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] After arriving in Beiping, Ambassador Stuart Leighton denied to reporters that the Ma-Stuart joint statement was the death knell of negotiations and that Commander-in-Chief Ma was about to return home. He said: "The door to peace is not completely closed, and negotiations are expected to continue. He and Commander-in-Chief Ma, as in the past, have hope for peace in China." A reporter asked: "Can the joint statement provide better stimulus for the peace talks at Makou?" He replied: "Hopefully so." A reporter asked: "If the peace talks fail, will the United States change its China policy?" He replied: "It may be so at that time, but we do not want it to be so, and the current China policy has not changed." When reporters inquired about his opinion on the Anping Incident, the Ambassador declined to answer. The Ambassador said: "He is scheduled to return to Nanjing in a week. This trip to the north is to handle personal and university affairs." A reporter asked: "Having been running between Nanjing and Beiping for the past month, do you feel it is better to be an ambassador or a university president?" The Ambassador smiled and replied: "It is better to be a university president!" Someone asked: "Will the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation be abolished?" The Ambassador replied: "No." The Commander-in-Chief Ma's Five-Star plane, which the Ambassador was on, departed Nanjing at 1:50 PM and arrived at Xiyuan Airport at 3:45 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Ambassador Stuart said: "Chairman Chiang has a message that he will return to Nanjing before the end of the month." A reporter asked if Lushan was preparing to hold a national unity discussion on the current situation. The Ambassador said that he had not been informed of this. The Ambassador commented on Chairman Chiang's proclamation today: "Very good, very good. This proclamation will help peace."</p>
<h3>The Murder Suspect is an Active Duty Soldier; Trial to be Held Under Military Law; Gu Zhutong Has Sent the Entire Case to the Central Government by Telegram</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 13th] After the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters solved the murder case of Ge Yiduo, it submitted the suspect and the entire case file to Commander-in-Chief Gu for review. It is reported that Mr. Gu has carefully reviewed the entire file and, because the suspect is an active-duty soldier, the case will be handled according to military law. He has ordered the Military Law Department of the Army General Headquarters, the Yunnan Provincial Security Command, and the 13th Gendarmerie Regiment stationed in Kunming to each send personnel to form a joint trial court to hold a regular trial and has already sent a telegram to the Central Government regarding the matter. In order to make the case clear to the public, letters will be sent to invite representatives from Kunming and local agencies, Yunnan's people's representative organs at all levels, legal groups, and the Democratic League to observe the proceedings. As for the Li Gongpu case, Commander-in-Chief Gu has repeatedly ordered the Yunnan security organs responsible for maintaining order to step up their pursuit and solve the case and bring the perpetrators to justice in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 13th] The Communist army in eastern Henan is actively attempting to cut the Longhai Railway. One unit of more than 10,000 people attacking Kaifeng concentrated its firepower on the 10th evening and launched another fierce attack on the city. The current situation in the city is unclear. On the 11th, Luo Wang, west of Kaifeng city, with 40 aircraft carrying reinforcements flew to Datong, which has improved the situation.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Five people, including Chen Tuanxing, from Datong, formed the "Shanxi Yanbei People's Petition Group" and came to Beiping on a convenient flight on the 11th to visit Director Li Zongren and requested urgent aid for the garrison's ammunition and food and to allow the people of Datong to take a convenient flight.

The Datong railway station has been repeatedly shelled. There are about 100,000 residents in the city, and about 80-90% of those who lack food are hungry, and they eat tree bark. In addition, Ying County has been surrounded for 25 days, and the tragic situation is the same as in Datong. They have also asked Director Li for assistance. If there is no problem with ammunition and food, Datong can be defended for a month.</p>
<h3>Inspection of the Qiantang River Seawall Completed; Engineering Team Returns to Shanghai and Hangzhou; Report to be Prepared and Submitted for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Jiaxing Dispatch, 13th] The Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Inspection Team, including Mao Yisheng and Wang Huzhen, left Haiyan for Jiaxing on the 13th. They had lunch at the Rain Pavilion of Nanhu Lake, and returned to Shanghai and Hangzhou in the afternoon.

<p>[Our Jiaxing Dispatch, 12th] The Haiyan Electric Qiantang Seawall Engineering Inspection Team took a car on the 12th at the most auspicious time. UNRRA American engineer Mei Annuo also came to participate. First, they went to Zhao Wei's No. 1 Dyke, which is 10 kilometers away from Haining. This place was newly breached at the beginning of August, measuring more than 20 meters. They are currently rushing to build a wooden embankment. Then they crossed Jianshan, Huangwan, Xiepu, Changchuan Dam and reached Qinshan Bay. The base of the embankment is still good, but the body of the embankment has been eroded. Then they went to Deng Weiqiao. According to the engineering experts of the team, the destruction of this type of stone embankment is closely related to mud and water piles. The experts have packed the soil into cans to take back for research. Then they arrived at Haiyan City. There are dangerous walls and broken walls in the county town, reflecting the wealth of the past, but now there are mixed feelings. Slogans such as "Welcome experts to build the underwater Great Wall" are posted on the street. This is enough to show the people along the river's earnest expectations for the experts.</p>

<h3>Gentry Association in Northern Jiangsu Sends a Letter to Zhou Enlai Urging the Communist Army to Withdraw Immediately, Hoping that Their Fellow Countryman Will Restore the People's Hearts</h3>
<p>[Our City News] More than 20 people, including Xie Shuqiang, Ma Shuli, Zhu Shiqiu, and other former national assemblymen in northern Jiangsu, recently jointly sent a letter to Zhou Enlai, requesting that he persuade the Communist Party to withdraw from northern Jiangsu. The general meaning of the original letter was: Northern Jiangsu has been devastated, oppressed, and squeezed by the enemy for eight years, and its vitality has been exhausted. After the victory, the Communist Party stole the cities and implemented the so-called "three capitals" and "three all" policies, resulting in people fleeing on the roads and a lack of a sense of community. Therefore, they earnestly appealed to the Communist Party to leave northern Jiangsu, so that the people can obtain true liberation. They also said: "The 3 million people currently exiled abroad, once they rise up and organize a returning team with a determination to die to survive, wherever the army goes, how can it not sweep away its hatred?" Finally, it was said: "It is reported that if the Communist army fails, it will breach the dikes to flood the area, and the fields, animals, and people of the more than 20 counties in the Lixia River will be destroyed. This move must not be allowed. If so, the Communist Party will isolate itself from the people. Then, what is the point of political party struggle? Therefore, Zhou is requested to respond to the people's request, consider the fellow villagers (Zhou is also from northern Jiangsu), restore the hearts of the people, restore the credibility of the Communist Party, and resolutely appeal to the Communist troops to withdraw from northern Jiangsu immediately, otherwise, they will respectfully appeal to the government to issue a clear order to suppress them."</p>

The duties of the special commissioner's office and the security commander's office have been entrusted to Secretary Wu Huiyi and Deputy Commander Zhu Changzhong, respectively, to open and process documents on his behalf.</p>
<h3>Message to the Compatriots from the Chairman</h3>
<p>Therefore, on this day of the first anniversary of the enemy's surrender, I would like to specifically put forward three points to guide my compatriots in a common direction of effort in order to comfort the spirits of the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed for the War of Resistance in heaven:</p>
<p>Clarify Right and Wrong and Uphold Integrity</p>
<p>First, we must clarify right and wrong and uphold integrity. The safety, danger, governance, and chaos of the nation and the nation all depend on the rise and fall of the people's concept of right and wrong and the principles of justice. The wisdom of people, the success or failure of things, all lie in distinguishing right from wrong and discerning interests. The location of right and wrong is the location of interests. The reason why our country's eight-year War of Resistance was able to last and win was entirely due to the spirit of our national army and civilians who only saw right and wrong and did not care about interests, and only knew great righteousness and did not hesitate to sacrifice. From this, we can know that interests are determined by right and wrong. The place of great interest must be great right, and the place of great wrong will eventually be great harm. We must never reverse the true right and wrong for temporary personal interests, and disregard the permanent welfare of the nation and the nation. At this moment of crisis and turbulence, it is especially necessary to base ourselves on facts and distinguish the location of right and wrong, so that national opinion has a fixed point and people's hearts have a direction. Then, even if the country has temporary turmoil, it will eventually be able to quickly recover and achieve peace and order. Otherwise, if the true and false are reversed, black and white are confused, heresies are rampant, and correct arguments disappear, over time, it will inevitably lead to becoming accustomed to wrong and regarding it as right, and harm as profit, and the nation and the nation will fall into an incurable situation. Therefore, our compatriots must uphold integrity and clarify right and wrong at this moment, and must not follow the crowd and mislead themselves and the country. Observing the general atmosphere in recent times, almost only interests are discussed and right and wrong are not discussed, only violence is known and justice is not known, and only puppets are known and the country is not known. This phenomenon must be completely corrected before the country can have a bright future.</p>
<p>Understand Propriety, Justice, and Know Shame</p>
<p>Second, we must understand propriety, justice, and know shame. A country must be established on the earth. Our China has been established for thousands of years and has gone through countless turmoils, but it has been able to stand firm without falling, all thanks to the high morality of our nation and the greatness of our national culture. Propriety, justice, integrity, and shame are the four dimensions of a country, and are especially the universally and deeply ingrained moral standards of our nation. In short, propriety and justice show people the canons of positive behavior, while integrity and shame are warnings to people about the scope of what is not allowed. At this time after the war, the moral standards are greatly damaged, especially in general urban areas, where human desires are rampant, and everyone regards taking advantage of difficulties and opportunistic acquisitions as their ability. Our national people with lofty ideals should take saving the nation and building the country as their responsibility, and must act as pillars in the middle stream to save the decadent hearts of the people. If we can understand propriety, we will naturally be brave to do what is right and go all out, keeping propriety and fulfilling our duties meticulously. If we can know shame, we will naturally respect ourselves, cherish ourselves, not lose our personality, and not have behaviors that degrade our dignity, and be despised by foreigners. In this way, with integrity and shame restraining each other and propriety and justice as preparation, society will have a positive and upward spirit, and the country will be able to establish a foundation of independence and freedom. Otherwise, if integrity and shame are swept away and propriety and justice are lost, the War of Resistance, although fought, will still be defeated, and the country, although it exists, will still be dead. The sadness of the matter is no greater than this. My patriotic and self-loving citizens must be vigilant and encourage themselves.</p>
<p>Clarify Responsibility and Abide by Laws and Discipline</p>
<p>Third, we must clarify responsibility and abide by laws and discipline. Citizens of modern countries all value responsibility, and all respect laws and discipline. Only by valuing responsibility can they be diligent and enterprising, and only by respecting laws and discipline can they maintain order. These two are the driving forces for progress. Our China is lagging behind in everything, and the concept of laws and discipline is the weakest. Now, when the world situation is uncertain, and it is also a time of national affairs, to overcome difficulties, strive for invigoration, and enter the ranks of modern countries, we must value responsibility and abide by the laws of war. We must know that the government has the responsibility of the government, and the people also have the responsibility of the people. We must clearly distinguish and examine, each according to their ability, each fulfilling their responsibility, not shirking, not being negligent, and then we can overcome all difficulties and do everything. At the same time, all of us, both up and down the country, must clarify and value discipline, abide by order, officials and historians must not abuse their power and hinder the freedom of the people, and the people must not abuse their freedom and abandon their national duties. In particular, we must strictly refrain from despising the law and disrupting order, so that our society is an orderly society, and our people are truly self-respecting and self-governing people.</p>
<p>The Great Undertaking of Rejuvenation Must Be Completed, and Any Resistance Cannot Be Stopped</p>
<p>Principles to be Followed, I further ask my compatriots across the country to embrace the ancient teaching of "When the wind and rain are dark, the rooster crows incessantly," and especially to strengthen their confidence, temper their aspirations, and recognize the importance of the relationship between China's post-war revival and world justice. Do not be pessimistic, do not be bewildered. We have fought hard for eight years in the War of Resistance, with strong and weak differences in labor, and what difficulties we have faced, we finally relied on unwavering confidence to achieve the final victory. Looking back then,</p>
<p>The above points are the criteria that the general public must abide by at ordinary times, and especially those that must be followed during the period of restoration and nation-building, it can be said that there is nothing to rely on. What we rely on is only the inherent culture and moral spirit of our nation for thousands of years, as well as human justice and world justice. The victory of China's War of Resistance has increased the power of international justice and the authority of morality. If, after defeating Japan, our China cannot maintain the fruits of victory and is still inevitably in danger and death, this is not only our own misfortune. What a great blow it will be to human justice. Understanding this meaning, we know that our efforts to turn around the domestic situation and achieve peaceful unification are in fact the most solemn task for the nation and the world. Now the war has long ended, and we are only waiting to clear the thorns, work hard later, engage in restoration, and complete the great cause of nation-building. From today's point of view, during the War of Resistance, we had such a persistent and unyielding spirit, and our nation has such a long history and great culture. What difficulties cannot be overcome and what construction cannot be completed. Although the current situation is extremely complex, the constant principles and rules are always constant. We must have confidence that the future of our nation is always bright and long-term, and that any resistance cannot stop our restoration. I, Zhongzheng, have been committed to the revolution, experienced hundreds of hardships, and led the War of Resistance for more than eight years. I can never allow the life of the Republic of China, which was exchanged for the sacrifice and bloodshed of countless soldiers and civilians, to be easily destroyed. I will never bear to add to the suffering of my people who have survived the war, and I will never change my established steps to pray for peaceful unification and democracy due to any stimulation or obstruction. I will inevitably act according to my conscience, fulfill my duties, and lead my compatriots across the country to advance on the road to nation-building according to procedures and common practices. With a sincere wish, I would like to express it to my compatriots on the occasion of today's commemoration, and I deeply hope that we can work together with one heart and one mind to eliminate the catastrophe of our country, preserve the lifeline of our nation, and jointly accomplish the full success of our revolutionary nation-building. (End)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Great Charter of National Revival</h3>
<p>— Reflections on Reading Chairman Chiang's Proclamation</p>
<p>The proclamation by Chairman Chiang, eagerly awaited by people at home and abroad, has finally arrived on the eve of the first anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender. In the past year, the people's displacement and suffering have not diminished, and the political disputes within the country have not ceased. We feel sincerely comforted upon reading the Chairman's proclamation. It shows that the government, in handling the current turmoil, has not hesitated to endure humiliation and make concessions out of concern for the people's welfare. The country is severely weakened after the war and cannot withstand further warfare. This painstaking effort is not only understood but also embraced by the people nationwide. Therefore, even though the domestic situation is so severe, the government still adheres to the policy of peaceful unification in handling the current political disputes. Consider what</p>
<p>the Chairman stated in the fifth point of his future policy directions within the proclamation: "As long as the Communist Party's army faithfully implements the agreement to cease conflict and restore transportation, and obeys mediation to implement unified organization, so that the nationalization of the army is not merely empty words, once this is guaranteed, the government can at any time concretely discuss all unresolved issues." This not only expresses the government's broad and benevolent attitude but also demonstrates that the path to reopening negotiations has not been cut off. The Chinese people, upon reading the Chairman's proclamation, are sincerely encouraged, needless to say. They have suffered enough from the Communist Party's disasters and urgently hope that the domestic situation can move towards stability, giving them an opportunity to recuperate and rebuild. They cannot tolerate this situation dragging on indefinitely. The government's willingness to compromise and endure humiliation is aimed at achieving an early resolution, and the frustration of their hopes is due to the Communist Party's sabotage. Therefore, today, after reading the Chairman's proclamation, we can only sincerely reiterate our urgent appeal to the Chinese Communist Party, hoping that they will prioritize the will of the people nationwide, consider the suffering of the people after the disaster, and demonstrate the sincerity of implementing previously established agreements through actions. The government has been more than generous to the Communist Party. Under these generous and favorable conditions, the Communist Party should prioritize national interests and refrain from creating further obstacles. Only then can China embark on the path of great revival.</p>
<p>Regarding the future policy to be adopted in resolving domestic political disputes, after studying the entire text, we feel as if this is truly a great charter for our nation's revival. The listed provisions and the spirit they embody are comparable to the Atlantic Charter. It points out the path for our future politics, reaffirms the government's determination to end tutelage and implement constitutionalism, and its long-cherished wish to sincerely cooperate with all parties and factions. All of this serves as a guiding principle for our future political democratization and is especially what the general public desires.</p>
<p>But what we find particularly inspiring are the three points that the Chairman has proclaimed to us: to distinguish between right and wrong and uphold righteousness, to understand propriety, righteousness, and a sense of shame to raise the level of our national morality, and to understand responsibility and abide by laws and disciplines to establish our social order. These may seem outdated, but they are the necessary foundation for our national revival. Truth has no distinction between outdated and new; as long as it is truth, it is always new. The root cause of all problems in China now lies in the lack of clear distinction between right and wrong, the decline of morality, and the lack of adherence to discipline. Because of these phenomena, moral principles have been lost. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, we must have a moral foundation to move forward on the path of national reconstruction and revival. The Chinese people should engrave these three points proclaimed by the Chairman in their hearts and be vigilant at all times. A nation standing on earth must have prosperity and standing. Our country has always been a nation that emphasizes propriety and righteousness and highly values morality. This is a solid foundation for our nation's development. In recent times, many Chinese people have regarded morality as pedantic, but they do not know that a nation without morality cannot stand in the world. Although the material civilization of Western European countries is highly developed, without their moral codes as the standard for the behavior of the people and even the nation, how could they have today's prosperity? Therefore, if we want to revive our nation, we must establish the moral foundation for national revival.</p>
<p>In summary, the entire text of the Chairman's proclamation is based on faith, hope, and love. Faith refers to the people's trust in the government. The government always prioritizes the interests of the people, so it always advocates resolving political disputes through political means. Therefore, the people must have faith in the government. Furthermore, all parties must have faith in resolving political disputes. The agreements that have been established are promises and must be adhered to and faithfully implemented. Love refers to the fact that the people certainly love and protect the government, and the government also loves the people, so it "does not hesitate to endure humiliation and make concessions in order to seek opportunities for rest and recuperation for all our compatriots." At the same time, although the Communist Party is expanding its occupied territories and demanding constant increases, and agreements are often overturned, the government still adheres to a broad-minded approach: "As long as the Communist Party's army faithfully implements the agreement to cease conflict and restore transportation, and obeys mediation to implement unified organization, so that the nationalization of the army is not merely empty words, once this is guaranteed, the government can at any time concretely discuss all unresolved issues." What is this if not "love"? Hope refers to the hope that the Communist Party can prioritize the interests of the people so that peaceful unification can be realized, and also the hope that the people can distinguish between right and wrong, understand propriety, righteousness, and a sense of shame, and understand responsibility and abide by laws and disciplines. After reading the entire text, we are even more convinced that domestic disputes can be resolved and that the Chinese nation will surely be revived, and that the Chairman's proclamation is truly the great charter for our national revival!</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Hurls Political Bomb at Turkey, Demands Control of the Straits, Britain Advocates Convening International Conference to Discuss Revising the Montreux Convention</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] London, 13th (Radio): The Soviet Union formally notified Turkey on the 8th of this month, advocating revising the Montreux Convention, believing that the administrative power of the Dardanelles Strait should be placed under the management of the Black Sea countries, with Turkey jointly responsible for the Strait's directional work.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] London, 13th (Radio): A British Foreign Office spokesman said today: If an international conference is held to revise the Montreux Convention, the United States may send representatives to participate. However, the other three signatory countries of the convention, namely Japan, Romania, and Bulgaria, may not have the opportunity to attend because they fought on the side of the Axis powers. It is noted that the three countries of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union signed an agreement at the Potsdam Conference that the Montreux Convention should be reconsidered.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Istanbul, 12th (Dispatch)] According to the latest news: In the note from the Soviet Union to Turkey requesting the revision of the Montreux Convention, it expresses the hope that only Black Sea littoral countries should discuss the new status of the Straits and the control of navigation. The Black Sea littoral countries are the Soviet Union, Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Istanbul, 12th (Dispatch)] The Turkish government has recently been considering the Soviet request to revise the Montreux Convention within the newly formed Bekar Cabinet. It is reported that the Soviet Union is not only requesting to revise the Montreux Convention but also wants to jointly control and defend the Dardanelles Strait with Turkey. The Turkish Cabinet held multiple meetings yesterday, which lasted until late at night. Officials are still keeping silent about the content of the Soviet note. Local people believe that the Soviet move is a political bombshell, and it is expected that the Turkish government will soon announce the full text of the Soviet note and the Turkish reply.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 12th (Dispatch)] According to semi-official sources, the Turkish reply to the Soviet Union will state that according to the Montreux Convention Regarding the Straits, the terms of the convention can only be revised with the consent of all signatory countries, so this matter cannot be negotiated solely by the Soviet Union and Turkey. Diplomatic circles generally believe that Turkey will take a firm stance on this issue and that the Straits issue is the most important issue related to Turkey's survival interests.</p>
<p>Britain Determined to Back Turkey, Likely to Cause Diplomatic Conflict</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th (Dispatch)] Local people predict that the Soviet Union's request to revise the Montreux Convention regarding the use of the Dardanelles will likely cause another diplomatic conflict between the Soviet Union and Western countries. The British government will back Turkey and allow it to oppose the Soviet Union's desire to gain a foothold in the Turkish Straits area. However, in view of its similar situation in the Suez Canal, Britain will likely seek a compromise to satisfy the Soviet Union's security demands. The Soviet note received by the British government at the end of the week has not yet been announced, but according to reliable sources, the Soviet Union will include its demand for joint control and defense of the Dardanelles in the note, citing its leading position in the Black Sea and its security. This means establishing military and air bases within Turkey. The Turkish government will certainly consider this as a loss of its independence and national security and will resolutely reject it. Britain now hopes to persuade the Soviet Union to accept a compromise solution, urging it to join the committee of the United Nations to control the Straits passage. Britain also supports the principle of revising the Montreux Convention proposed by the United Nations in November last year.</p>
<h3>Mysterious Missile Again Visits Swedish Skies, Swedish General Staff Considers Situation Serious, Commonly Called Russian V-4 Missile</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Swedish Capital, 12th (Dispatch)] Recently, mysterious missiles have been passing through Swedish skies. Another one was discovered in the central skies yesterday, and the national atmosphere is in an abnormal state of tension. It is rumored that the Swedish government has borrowed several radars from Britain to investigate the source of this mysterious bomb. American long-range bomber expert General Doolittle has departed for here. Although officials say that this is to negotiate business on behalf of Shell Oil Company, it is generally believed to be related to the mysterious bomb. The Swedish General Staff announced today, "The situation is extremely serious!" The repeated infringements of Swedish sovereignty can no longer be tolerated and should be ended by various means. Last night and this morning, the General Staff received more than a thousand reports</p>
<p>regarding the mysterious rocket bomb. The authorities have also sent experts to investigate evidence throughout the country. The reports vary, with some saying it is circular, but all say that small fireballs were ejected after the explosion. The Swedish public now commonly calls it the "Russian V-4" missile. The Swedish government has ordered its embassy in Finland to jointly investigate with the Finnish authorities.</p>
<p>[United Press, Swedish Capital, 12th (Dispatch)] Today, an experienced observer in the local newspaper claimed: Yesterday, he saw an unmanned rocket flying by. The body was like a torpedo, with a pointed tail, emitting bluish-green smoke and a series of fireballs. This observer had been trained in observing celestial phenomena and used a telescope to watch the clouds when the rocket appeared. Its speed was higher than that of an aircraft. It disappeared completely after an explosion, leaving no smoke, light, or sparks. This rocket</p>
<p>was about ninety to one hundred feet long (thirty meters). Before the explosion, it stayed in the air and began to descend. The flash of fire dazzled the eyes. The previous rocket that passed through Switzerland was launched from the coast of Poland. The explosion proved that it was equipped with an automatic destruction device, so experts could not find its traces. Swedish newspapers can confirm the existence of automatic destruction device.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Swedish Lorea, 13th (Dispatch)] Last night, a bomb fell on a building in Zhulan Province. A lieutenant in the Swedish Air Force witnessed the event and said that the missile was shaped like a torpedo, about twenty meters long, and had a fire tail when flying. The Swedish authorities have strengthened alert in the Noland area. It is speculated that missiles have also fallen within Norway, and they are generally speculated to have been launched from the Soviet-occupied area of Germany.</p>
<h3>American Jet Rocket Creates New Record</h3>
<p>[United Press, Fort Virginia, Leichmond, 12th (Dispatch)] The Army announced that the jet-propelled P-80 rocket flew from Worto, Washington State, to here in thirty-five minutes today, a distance of 395 miles, creating an unofficial new record.</p>
<h3>Another Batch of Indian Troops Arrives in Basra, Iraq Plans to Appeal to the Security Council</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Report from Afar, 12th (Dispatch)] Two ships arrived in Basra today, carrying troops from India to protect British, Indian, and Arab interests in southern Iran.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 12th (Dispatch)] Iranian Ambassador to the United States Alai declared today that the presence of British troops in Basra and the threat of unilateral action taken by the British side cannot be tolerated. This situation may force Iran to submit this dispute to the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Attacks Netherlands, Accuses it of Being a Vassal of Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 12th (Dispatch)] Soviet commentator Sergei criticized the Netherlands' attitude in the peace conference. He briefly stated that the Netherlands is a "vassal of Britain and the United States." Studying the relationship between the "British and American leaders" and their "vassals" is sufficient to understand the attitude of the Dutch representative. The Netherlands is a small country with vast colonies, including Indonesia, with its colonies sixty times the size of its mainland. If it wants to develop them, its work is beyond the capacity of the Dutch military and it has to jointly manage them with powerful countries. The rich territory of the Netherlands is now not only developed by one country, but Britain and the United States are also participating, he said.</p>
<h3>Yoshida Broadcasts to the Nation on Anniversary of Japanese Surrender</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 13th (Dispatch)] Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida will deliver a broadcast speech to the nation at 7:03 PM Tokyo time on August 14th, the anniversary of Japan's surrender.</p>
<h3>Another Representative of Former Enemy Nation Speaks at the Peace Conference, Romanian Deputy Prime Minister Expresses Heartfelt Gratitude for Recovering Pre-War Lost Territories, Damage Suffered Should Be Compensated by Germany and Hungary</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Paris, 13th (Radio): The peace conference continued at 3:05 PM (midnight Shanghai time) today. The Romanian representative, Deputy Prime Minister Tătărescu, spoke at 4:10 PM at the invitation of Bernas. He first expressed his gratitude for the points in the draft peace treaty with Romania prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers. He stated that the provision in the draft treaty for the return of northern Outer Transylvania to Romania is another reason for the Romanians to express their heartfelt gratitude. This move can bring the Romanian and Hungarian peoples closer together in cooperation.</p>
<p>He then elaborated on the political, military, and economic provisions, one by one. He expressed regret that the status of Romania, which leaned towards the Allied front and became an Axis participant, was not clarified. Tătărescu acknowledged that Romania was drawn into the anti-Soviet war by the rash actions of traitors and adventurers, but he vigorously stated that since August 24, 1944, based on the armistice agreement, the Romanian army, with eighteen divisions totaling 385,000 men, equipped with air force units, launched an attack on the Nazi aggressors and the Hungarian army, with at least 110,000 killed or wounded. At that time, not a single soldier was fighting side by side with the German side. They had fulfilled their loyalty to the Allies, so the losses suffered should be compensated by Germany and Hungary, and Romania has the right to demand this, he said. Deputy Prime Minister Tătărescu was still young. At the beginning of his speech, he appeared to be "stage-frightened," but he quickly regained his confidence and demeanor.</p>
<h3>List of Our Representatives Attending Various Committees of the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 12th (Dispatch)] The Chinese delegation attending the peace conference in Paris has decided on the list of personnel representing our country in various committees as follows: The representatives attending the General Issues Committee are Wang Shijie and Guo Taiqi, the representative attending the Political and Territorial Committee of the peace treaty with Italy is Guo Taiqi, the representative attending the Military Committee of the peace treaty with Italy is also Zhan Bingchang, and the representative attending the Legal Drafting Committee is Qian Tai.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 12th (Dispatch)] The conference assembly discussed the organization of the Secretariat of the Conference. The Soviet Union opposed the appointment of Australian Foreign Minister Evatt as Secretary, suggesting that an Abyssinian fill the position, but Abyssinia refused. Britain then suggested that China, Brazil, and Yugoslavia, who had previously formed the Secretariat with the Four Powers, should form the Secretariat, which was adopted, and French Thebac was elected as Secretary-General.</p>
<h3>Soviet Foreign Minister Sharply Refutes Italian Prime Minister's Statement, Says Anti-Fascist Remnants Must Be Eradicated, Representative from Greece Also States Opinion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Paris, 13th (Radio): Bernas and Vyshinsky had a heated debate during yesterday night's conference discussing the peace treaty with Italy. Today, Molotov accused some major powers of being unwilling to consider the interests of both France and Italy, intending to create a hegemonic position in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th (Dispatch)] The peace conference opened at 10 AM today, still chaired by American Bernas. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov visited and expressed his opinion, refuting the speech given by Italian Prime Minister Gasperi at the conference the other day. His language was severe, but the atmosphere was far more orderly than that of the Procedural Committee. French Prime Minister Bidault and British Foreign Secretary Bevin were not present. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt changed his position and talked with friends. The Soviet delegation listened to the speech of the British. The British said that they believe Italy will become a free and great nation. Mussolini's Italy had taken the path of imperialism in the past, colluding with Germany and Japan, and Italy had invaded Abyssinia, Albania, and France. Even in the Battle of Stalingrad, when the German army was defeated, Italy gradually split from Germany. The past is full of verifiable facts. The failure of Fascism is not the reason why Italy should be reduced to a second-class country. Italy and France should not lose their status as major Mediterranean powers. A reformed and new Italy must have a harmonious relationship with the Allies and should be honest with all democratic countries. The political life of Italy must be reformed into a democratic country, and the remnants of Fascism must be reduced. Italy has not achieved all these points. In Gasperi's entire speech, he did not mention Fascism and Mussolini, and the purpose was to defend the interests of his country. Gasperi insisted on the Fascist aggression (representatives of Slavic countries and war), and Gasperi did not express the views of a democratic Italy on Trieste and Istria, but instead reiterated the old articles of imperialist Italy. Yugoslavia has made great contributions to the victory. If Italy does not consider the demands of the South, it will not harm its democratic rebirth, he said. After Molotov's speech, Abyssinian representative Julodov gave a speech, condemning Italy for invading Abyssinia three times in a century. Finally, Greek Rifanel Tris spoke, saying that Italy should be fully responsible for the disasters suffered by Greece and that Greece should receive full compensation in order to implement economic recovery. After Tsai's simple speech, Chairman Bernas announced a recess and will resume at 3 PM in the afternoon. At that time, the Romanian representative will express his opinion.</p>
<h3>Peace Conference Delegates Suffer from Soap Shortage</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 12th (Dispatch)] The lack of soap is also one of the difficulties faced by the peace conference delegates. When the conference opened, the delegates received food and clothing ration coupons, but no soap ration coupons. After requesting, each person only received one soap coupon. Women received facial soap, and men received shaving soap, so the current problem is whether men can wash their faces with shaving soap.</p>
<h3>United States Proposes in the Control Committee for Japan to Invite Representatives from Eleven Countries to Discuss the Occupation of Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 13th (Dispatch)] MacArthur today proposed by US Representative Acheson at a special meeting of the United Nations Control Committee for Japan to invite representatives from the eleven countries participating in the Pacific War to jointly discuss the occupation of Japan. The representatives from the United Kingdom, Italy, and China must seek instructions from their governments before expressing their opinions. Acheson claimed that if the representatives of the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Committee wish to attend informally and contribute their opinions, it will benefit the Supreme Commander and promote the purposes of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Whaling Area Extends to the Southern Ocean</h3>
<p>MacArthur Headquarters Has Approved</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 13th (Dispatch)] Diplomatic circles here officially stated today that MacArthur Headquarters has allowed Japan to send whaling ships to the Southern Ocean. It is expected that the Soviet Union, Australia, and the United States will soon raise strong protests.</p>
<h3>Seven Arab Foreign Ministers Willing to Negotiate with British Government on the Palestine Issue, but Oppose Meeting at the Same Table with Jews. British Formally Orders Ban on Immigration into Palestine</h3>
<p>[This News Agency Report] London, 13th (Broadcast): It is reported that the foreign ministers of seven Arab countries have agreed to negotiate with the British side on the Palestine issue, but do not want Jews to participate.</p>
<p>[This News Agency Report] London, 13th (Broadcast): A spokesman for the British Colonial Office today accused American financiers of being responsible for encouraging Jews to illegally immigrate to Palestine.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Alexandria, 12th]: The foreign ministers of the seven Arab League countries began meeting here today to formulate a common policy for participating in the London Conference. It is reported that Arab leaders of Palestine, including Jerusalem's Mufti Hajj Amin al-Husseini, will demand stronger policies to protect the interests of the Arab community in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th]: The British government issued an official gazette tonight stating that the British government has instructed the Palestinian authorities to immediately stop accepting illegal immigrants into Palestine. All immigrants arriving illegally should be transferred to Cyprus or other places, pending a decision on their future fate.</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Corpse Finally Discovered</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Milan, 13th]: Mussolini's corpse has been missing for a long time. Italian military and police conducted a large-scale search, but to no avail. Until last night, a monk discovered it in the Casucian Monastery in Pavia, south of Milan. The corpse was wrapped in a burlap sack, locked in a box, and hidden in the monastery's cellar. Abbot Lombo stated that a stranger came yesterday afternoon and handed him a box, ordering him to hide it. It is suspected that this person is the main culprit in stealing and hiding the corpse. A notice was found in the burlap sack next to the corpse, bearing the name "Mogge, Founder of Democracy and Fascism." Mogge had already been arrested. The contents of the notice prove the corpse's origin, confirming that it is indeed Mussolini.</p>
<h3>Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Analyzes Current Soviet Policies (Part 2) He Says Roosevelt Was Mistaken</h3>
<p>(3) The Secret Police System</p>
<p>The Tsars used the secret police as a tool to maintain their autocratic rule. This method continued to exist after the revolution. Although the organization has been reorganized three times since Lenin's "Cheka," its nature has never changed. The secret police receive better treatment, lodging, and food than the Red Army. They have their own artillery units, air force, prisons, and execution grounds. As for personnel, they now number over 600,000. The people of the Soviet Union are completely under their secret surveillance.</p>
<p>Even the Red Army is subject to the jurisdiction of the "OGPU." Every residential area, factory, farm, organization, and theater has secret agents stationed there. Every Communist Party member must report to them any suspicious thoughts or criticisms they hear. Foreign ambassadors, Soviet dignitaries, and high-ranking Red Army generals are followed by secret police. They even secretly installed recording devices in the bedroom of the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davies, to eavesdrop on his words. Each foreign ambassador is followed by four secret agents day and night in shifts. If a Soviet citizen speaks to them, someone will immediately ask what they said. In front of the American consulate residence in Vladivostok, the secret police installed a searchlight, directly facing the house, and a face peered in through the window day and night to see who was inside. Soviets never dared to step through that door. The secret police rule the entire Soviet Union with terror.</p>
<p>In the fields of science and art, a non-Communist Party member may still achieve fame and reach a high position. But in other areas, anyone who wants to achieve a significant political or economic position must be a party member. Of course, there is only one party in the Soviet Union; the other parties have all been "cleared."</p>
<p>Stalin faithfully executed Lenin's instructions from 1901, which stated that the party should not be an ordinary so-called political party, but a "military organization." Lenin said, "The party must lead the proletariat in attack, and if necessary, lead them in retreat."</p>
<p>According to democratic principles, the leader of a political party must meet the wishes of the voters; otherwise, people will elect someone else next time. But in the Soviet Union, there is only one political party. The "election" is merely selecting the list determined by the government dictator. Elections here are nothing more than a government-organized spectacle.</p>
<p>(4) The Communist Doctrine</p>
<p>The Soviet government believes in this communist doctrine, which holds that once all countries in the world are under Communist Party dictatorship and the system of private property is completely eradicated, all domestic and international wars will cease. At that time, the state will cease to exist, and people all over the world can live and work in peace. Lenin said, "Where there is the state, there is no freedom; where there is freedom, there is no need for the state." Perhaps it is the mysterious nature of this sentence that has aroused religious-like fanaticism in many people. Since the highest ideal in life is to promote the elimination of the state system and the establishment of a worldwide communist dictatorship, then the highest responsibility of man is to try to achieve this goal. In order to achieve this goal, all means, including war, assassination, betrayal, and breach of contract, can be used. Lenin once said, "It is necessary to use any tricks, cunning, illegal acts, and concealment of the truth." Therefore, the goal of the Soviet government should be to achieve a world proletarian dictatorship by any means.</p>
<p>The following passage from Lenin more clearly contains the basic theory of Soviet foreign policy: "We do not live in one country, but in a system of countries. It is inconceivable that the Soviet government can coexist peacefully with imperialist countries for a long time. In the end, either we must subdue them or they must subdue us. The conflict between the Soviet government and the propertied government is an avoidable event." [Lenin: "Selected Works of Lenin" Stalin: "Problems of Leninism" contains excerpts]</p>
<p>Those who think that Soviet diplomacy is too uncertain are confusing goals and tactics. The goal of the Soviet government has always been unchanged, but tactics change from time to time depending on the circumstances, just like a good chief of staff hides his plans and moves his troops. It carefully weighs its strengths and weaknesses, advances when it can advance, and retreats when it must retreat. In this situation, all peace treaties and non-aggression pacts are regarded as nothing more than tools. They sign them because they feel that they seem useful temporarily, and then break them tomorrow because they do not conform to the goal of world proletarian revolution.</p>
<p>It is very unfortunate that while the whole world is striving for peace in the status quo, the Soviet Union is still striving for the expansion of its own ideology.</p>

<h3>Completing Local Self-Government, Promoting Municipal Construction, First Municipal Council Solemnly Established Yesterday, Pan Gongzhan and Xu Jiyun Elected Speaker and Deputy Speaker</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Shanghai's first Municipal Council solemnly held its inauguration ceremony and took office yesterday, the first "August 13th" anniversary after the victory. A total of 171 councilors attended, exceeding half the total. After a brief break and photo session at 9:25 AM, the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker began. Du Yuesheng and Xu Jiyun were elected. However, Du Yuesheng declined the position on the spot due to physical weakness. Therefore, a re-election of the Speaker was legally conducted, and finally Pan Gongzhan was elected as the first Speaker in Shanghai's history with an absolute majority of 154 votes.</p>
<p>The Venue Was Decorated with a Solemn Atmosphere</p>
<p>Yesterday's venue, No. 1 Zhongzheng West Road, was accessed through the Huashan Road gate. From around 7:00 AM, the traffic was constant and never-ending. Above the entrance were hung two banners with the national flag, the party flag, and the ethnic flag. On the right side was a brown wooden sign with the words "Shanghai Municipal Council" written in green. Upon entering, one immediately felt surrounded by greenery, making it exceptionally cool. Passing through a square, one arrived at the auditorium. Above it hung a banner in red silk with white letters reading "Inauguration Ceremony of the First Shanghai Municipal Council." Below were attached two large golden characters, "Ming Chang". The auditorium had 180 seats, divided into five long rows, with stationery provided on each desk. This newspaper presented each seat with a copy of the day's paper, placed on the desk for reading. To the left of the councilors' seats were the reporters' seats, and to the right were the visitors' seats. In front of the rostrum were potted plants with fragrant grass, and in the center were the national flag, the party flag, and the portrait of the Founding Father. On the four walls were posted slogans such as "Promote Public Opinion," "Exercise Civil Rights," "Speak Without Reservation," "Say Everything," "Complete Local Self-Government," and "Promote Municipal Construction," creating an extremely solemn, simple, and harmonious atmosphere for the conference.</p>
<p>171 Councilors Attended</p>
<p>This newspaper's reporter drove there early yesterday morning at 7:00 AM and was the first to arrive. Soon after, Wan Molin of the Municipal Farmers' Association arrived, being the first councilor to arrive. At 7:35 AM, Mayor Wu, accompanied by Chuan Rulin, strolled in while chatting and laughing. Five minutes later, Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Yiqu, and Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, also arrived. By the time the meeting began, out of the 180 councilors, 5 had not reported in, and 4 were absent with leave, totaling 171 in attendance. Those attending as observers included the directors of various bureaus and departments of the municipal government, such as Xuan Tiewu, Wu Kaixian, and Gu Chunfan, and over ten others. Guests included Yen Hui-ching, Cheng Zhongxing, Chen Baohua, as well as US Army Commander General Gillon, US Navy Commander in Shanghai Rear Admiral Dougherty, US Consul General Davis, British Acting Consul General Ottington, French Consul General Pays, Portuguese Acting Consul General Rico, Chilean Chargé d'Affaires Dr. Marin, and dignitaries from the Resources Committee such as Keswick and Judge Hale.</p>
<h3>Mayor Delivers Speech and Administers Oath, Expresses Three Hopes and Two Points in His Thoughts</h3>
<p>At 8:25 AM, Mayor Wu led the distinguished guests from the reception room into the meeting hall. At exactly 8:30 AM, the meeting began. Mayor Wu, as the convener and chairman of the conference, performed the formalities amidst melodious music, and then reported to the conference. Mayor Wu first asked everyone to stand in silence for three minutes. Then, he delivered the opening remarks, stating: "Today is the anniversary of the August 13th Incident. It is only after eight years of arduous resistance that we have the glory of today. Therefore, choosing this day to hold the inaugural meeting of the Municipal Council has its own profound significance. Now, with the pain settled, we should deeply consider three points: (1) Why was there an August 13th Incident? Why did the Japanese dare to invade our country? The remote cause lies in the corruption and division of the Manchu Qing royal family, giving foreigners the opportunity to invade. The proximate cause is that after the revolution and unification, the Japanese devils witnessed our spirit of striving for good governance and felt deeply afraid, and thus did not hesitate to become the pioneers of war. From the lessons of the eight-year war of resistance, we deeply feel that only unity and solidarity can lead to survival, and division is a way of self-destruction. Therefore, we must be united and solidarity in the future, from the country to Shanghai, we must seek survival and progress in sincere unity. (2) Today is the inauguration date of the first official Municipal Council. According to the procedure of the National Revolution, we have now entered the era of constitutional government from the era of tutelage. From today onwards, Shanghai has returned the government to the people. All facilities of the municipal government will be subject to the Municipal Council. (3) Today, both the central government and the local government are moving towards democratic politics. I hope that everyone will unite together, no matter which side, to run the municipal affairs well, especially not to forget the significance of the August 13th Anti-Japanese War, to unite sincerely, and to revitalize the country." The Mayor finally thanked the enthusiastic participation of the councilors, and said: "This truly symbolizes that the future of the city will have unlimited light." After the speech, Mayor Wu, on behalf of Minister of Interior Zhang Lisheng, who was unable to come to Shanghai due to official business, administered the oath. All the councilors stood solemnly, faced the portrait of the Founding Father, raised their right hands, and recited the oath with the administrator: "I solemnly swear that I will恪遵 follow the Founding Father's will, uphold the Three Principles of the People, obey the laws, respect the public opinion of the local people, be loyal and diligent in my duties, and will never engage in corruption or bribery. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This is my oath." Subsequently, they signed and stamped the oath separately and handed it to the conference staff for collection. After the oath, Mayor Wu delivered another speech, saying: "All the councilors are elected by the people, representing public opinion, and reviewing municipal affairs. Therefore, I have two hopes for the Municipal Council: (1) Shanghai's position is different from that of other provinces and counties. I hope that you can fully express public opinion and not be limited to the interests of individuals and districts. (2) There are many difficulties in building a modern Shanghai. The municipal government is limited by funds, and its strength is not enough in many places. I hope that you will provide some suggestions, mainly constructive ones, and the government will make every effort to adopt and implement them."</p>
<h3>Guests Deliver Speeches</h3>
<p>Then, Chen Bin, Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Department, delivered a speech, saying: "Although the War of Resistance has been won, the people are still suffering. I hope that the representatives elected by the people can relieve the people's suffering." Then, Cheng Zhonghang, Supervising Commissioner, delivered a speech: "Shanghai is China's leading city. After the establishment of the Municipal Council, democratic politics has begun to be implemented. Believing that the disciples of democracy can follow the Founding Father's spirit of seeking freedom and equality for China and seeking happiness for the citizens of Shanghai. This is the first point. Secondly, there are two aspects to implementing democratic politics: (1) The administrative organs should respect public opinion; (2) The public opinion organs should fully realize public opinion. This is the second point. Shanghai has been under occupation for eight years, and everything needs to be rebuilt. There are naturally some obstacles that need to be swept away and eliminated before politics can embark on a clear path." Cha Liangjian, President of the Local Court, also delivered a speech, expressing the hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council can become the most representative council of public opinion in the country, and hoping that the Shanghai Municipal Government can become the most capable agency.</p>
<p>The conference emcee immediately announced that the councilors' representatives would deliver a reply. At that time, Councilor Wang Xianqing proposed that Pan Gongzhan should speak, which was immediately unanimously approved (for the full text of Pan Gongzhan's speech, see elsewhere). After the speech, the chairman announced a recess. It was 9:20 AM.</p>
<h3>Du Yuesheng Firmly Resigns as Speaker, Pan Gongzhan Elected in Re-election</h3>
<p>At 9:25 AM, all the councilors and guests gathered on the lawn in front of the conference hall for a group photo. Then, all the councilors took a photo. After returning to the meeting hall, the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker began. First, the mayor read out the election regulations, and then the conference selected Wang Xianqing, Tao Baichuan, Feng Youzhen, Shui Xiangyun, and Lu Shidao to be the tellers. During the nomination, the staff distributed ballots to each councilor for signature and receipt. The election began with the tellers inspecting the empty ballot box, which was placed under the rostrum. At 10:00 AM, the councilors voted one after another, completing the process in seven minutes. When counting the ballots, Feng Youzhen first reported that the number of ballots issued matched the number of ballots received, and then Wang Xianqing was designated to announce the votes, with Tao Baichuan and Feng Youzhen supervising the announcement. A large blackboard was set up below the stage, and two conference staff members wrote the votes, with Shui Xiangyun and Lu Shidao supervising the writing. The first vote announced was for the Speaker, and the atmosphere immediately became extremely tense. After the votes were counted, Mayor Wu immediately announced, "Du Yuesheng received 116 votes and is elected Speaker." The other votes received were also reported by Mayor Wu as follows: Pan Gongzhan 17 votes, Xu Shihao 1 vote, Wang Zhengting 1 vote, 34 blank votes. Then, the vote for Deputy Speaker was opened, and Xu Jiyun was elected Deputy Speaker with 116 votes. After Mayor Wu reported the election results, Du Yuesheng stood up and said: "Chairman, councilors, I am very honored to be elected Speaker today. However, our country is moving towards democracy, and Shanghai is a major city. The responsibility of the Speaker is extremely important. I am a sick person and cannot take on the task. I do not want to disappoint the public's kindness, but because of my poor health, please forgive me and allow a re-election." Du Yuesheng repeatedly stated that he was breathless as soon as he spoke, indicating that he was physically incapable. However, a few councilors still stood up and spoke, firmly asking Du Yuesheng to do his best. Du Yuesheng declined again and again. Later, Dr. Zhou from Nanjing testified on the spot that Du Yuesheng was indeed unable to cope with overwork. Councilor Zhu Yixuan also said: "Councilor Du is the popular choice, but since he is in poor health and firmly requests to resign, please hold a re-election in accordance with the law." The conference chairman immediately announced that a re-election for the Speaker would be held. The re-election began at 10:55 AM. The councilors filled out and cast their ballots again. 168 ballots were issued and 168 ballots were received, which Feng Youzhen reported as consistent. The result of the vote was that Pan Gongzhan was elected Speaker with an absolute majority (154 votes). The remaining vote counts were as follows: Wu Shaoshu 3 votes, Du Yuesheng 2 votes, Tao Baichuan 2 votes, Wang Xiaolai 2 votes, Xi Yushu 1 vote, Zhu Yixuan 1 vote, 1 blank vote, and 1 invalid vote.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu announced the election results again, saying: Pan Gongzhan was elected Speaker, and Xu Jiyun was elected Deputy Speaker. After the Speaker and Deputy Speaker took the oath of office on stage, the ceremony was declared complete. It was 11:25 AM.</p>
<h3>Telegram of Respect to the Chairman</h3>
<p>The full text of the telegram of respect to the Chairman passed by the Municipal Council is as follows: Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government of Nanjing: This council was established on August 13th. All councilors were sworn into office and elected the Speaker and Deputy Speaker. We admire your leadership, your dedication to national construction, and your leadership in promoting the Founding Father's teachings and advocating for democratic governance. This council admires and accommodates diverse opinions, gathers collective wisdom, supports municipal administration, and promotes public sentiment. With sincerity and devotion, we offer our contributions to alleviate your hard work and serve as reliable support. We respectfully submit this telegram to express our sincere respect. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the First Shanghai Municipal Council, Xu Jiyun, Deputy Speaker, and all councilors jointly kowtow (August 8th) Yuan (August 13th).</p>
<p>[Another Report] After the successful conclusion of the inaugural meeting of the First Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday afternoon, Mayor Wu specially hosted a banquet at the Yiyuan Grand Hotel for all the councilors and more than 40 reporters from various newspapers who attended the ceremony and reported on the news. Everyone enjoyed the occasion and dispersed in high spirits.</p>
<h3>First August 13th After the Victory of the War of Resistance, Public Training Students in This City Commemorate Martyred Heroes, Wu Tiecheng and Yang Hu Personally Preside Over, Cornerstone Laying Ceremony for the Memorial Tower Held in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Public Training Students Association, in order to commemorate the heroic martyrs who died in the War of Resistance, specially held the Memorial Service for the Martyrs of the Shanghai Public Training Students in the War of Resistance at the Great Guangming Theater on the first "August 13th" Songhu War of Resistance Memorial Day after the victory. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a plain archway was erected at the entrance of the Great Guangming, and wreaths and elegiac couplets were spread throughout the courtyard. The top was decorated with white embroidered cloth curtains, and the horizontal plaque with the Chairman's own inscription of "Encourage Steadfastness Together" was hung in the center. On both sides were the elegies by Bai Chongxi, "Heroic and Admirable", and Chen Cheng, "Righteousness Reaches the Clouds". Under the party and national flags, the portraits of the fourteen martyrs were reflected under a pair of serene white candles, making people stand in awe. The memorial service began at 10:20 AM. Wu Tiecheng, Yang Hu, Xuan Tiewu, Wu Guozhen (represented by Wu Kaixian), Li Xiangqi, and Tao Yizhi served as the main sacrificial group. After playing mourning music and performing the rituals solemnly, Wu Tiecheng first presented the wreath and read the instruction of the Chairman of the National Government. Then, Xie Chunpu, leader of the Public Training Investigation and Registration Group, read the eulogy. Li Xiangqi, former Director of the Public Training Office, reported on the past situation of organization and training and the participation in the war.</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng's Eulogy</p>
<p>Later, Wu Tiecheng, the former Mayor of Shanghai, delivered a speech, saying: The participation of Shanghai's trained citizens in the War of Resistance is commendable and moving. Today, all of you present were personally trained and once protected Shanghai with the predecessors and heroes. I extend my utmost respect to you. China is now a free and independent country. This is a golden opportunity to build a new China. Centuries of history tell us that "cities" are the places where democratic politics originate. Shanghai has the most complete conditions among the cities in China. It is the economic and industrial center of the country. Therefore, I hope that the citizens of Shanghai, especially the trained citizens, will build the country with the spirit of "August 13th" anti-aggression. If all the citizens of Shanghai can unite, cooperate, help each other, and jointly seek the welfare of the entire Shanghai, then I believe that local democratic politics will be successfully tested by the citizens of Shanghai first! I hope that Shanghai will be a model of local democratic politics in the country, gradually promoting it, and building a truly democratic new China that is governed by the people, for the people, and owned by the people. After Wu's speech, Yang Hu, former Commander of the Songhu Garrison, and Xuan Tiewu, the current Garrison Commander, successively delivered speeches, praising the spirit of sacrifice of the martyred heroes and encouraging those who survived to continue their efforts.</p>
<h3>Unable to Speak, Overcome with Grief: The Bereaved Family's Tearful Words Move Hearts</h3>
<p>Finally, Ms. Bai Jianfen, a representative of the bereaved family of the martyrs, delivered a speech of thanks. As Ms. Bai ascended the sacrificial altar, sorrow overwhelmed her. Before she could even open her mouth, she was already sobbing uncontrollably, barely managing to compose herself. However, the sounds she uttered were fragmented, each word accompanied by tears, deeply moving the hearts of those present. Many members of the presiding group and guests were moved to tears as well. Ms. Bai Jianfen is the daughter of Bai Mengze, a member of the Public Training Corps who died heroically in the war to defend the motherland. Bai left behind a son and two daughters, whose livelihoods depend entirely on their elderly grandmother, living in utmost poverty. Bai Jianfen has now graduated from high school, and her younger sister has also completed junior high school. However, due to a lack of funds for tuition, she will be forced to drop out of school next semester. In addition to expressing her gratitude to the guests, Ms. Bai also requested the following four points be conveyed to the government: (1) Issue certificates and medals to the deceased martyrs as a lasting memorial. (2) Please provide long-term compensation to ensure the survival of the bereaved, young and old. (3) Establish schools for the children of the bereaved, so they may avoid the hardship of being unable to attend school. (4) Currently, only a little over a hundred martyrs are registered. There must be many omissions. Please widely solicit registrations from all sectors of society to comfort the heroic souls of the deceased. The memorial service ended at twelve o'clock. After the meeting, former Mayor Wu Tiecheng personally approached the bereaved families, inquiring about Bai Jianfen's address in detail and promising to do his best to help.</p>
<p>Foundation Stone Laid After the Memorial Tower Meeting</p>
<p>After the meeting, according to the planned schedule, the group marched collectively to the Old West Gate in the Nanshi district to hold the groundbreaking ceremony for the Public Training Corps Anti-Japanese War Memorial Tower. Led by a band, the procession turned east from Da Guangming Road, turned onto Nanjing West Road, and arrived at the Old West Gate at 12:40 PM. Many citizens stood by the roadside to watch. The ceremony began at 1:20 PM, still presided over by Wu Tiecheng. He briefly stated that the construction of the memorial tower was only to express admiration for the spirit of the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country, so that those who came after would make even greater contributions to the nation and the people. Then, Battalion Commander Tao Yishan reported on the Public Training Corps' participation in the Anti-Japanese War and the historical account of covering the retreat of the National Army during the "August 13th" Battle. After the speech, the groundbreaking ceremony began. Wu Tiecheng, Li Xiaoqi, and Tao Yishan stood facing the yellow earth, which was covered with a Republic of China flag with a blue sky, white sun, and a red earth, and a wreath. Before the groundbreaking, the national flag and wreath were removed. Wu held a hoe, and Li and Tao each held a shovel. Music resounded, firecrackers burst, and reporters scrambled to capture the scene with their cameras. Finally, Wu led everyone in shouting slogans such as "Long Live the Republic of China," "Long Live Chairman Chiang," and "Long Live Shanghai," after which the meeting ended.</p>
<p>In addition, Secretary-General Wu specially held a tea party at the Kangle Restaurant yesterday afternoon to receive the relatives of the martyrs.</p>

<h3>Investigation Team Sends Letter to Police Bureau: Wang Zhuchen Detained, Decision to Transfer Entire Case to High Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] As a result of the investigation by the investigation team for days of Wang Zhuchen's concealing of enemy and puppet supplies case, the evidence is deemed conclusive. It has been decided to transfer all case files and documents to the High Prosecutor's Office today, and a public letter to the Police Bureau will be sent to detain Wang. According to the two committee members responsible for the investigation of the case, Zhang Qingzhen and Wu Wangji, the suspicious points of this case are: (1) The "Special Repair Office of the Garrison Headquarters" claimed by Wang Zhuchen was denied by the Garrison Headquarters. (2) The Garrison Headquarters has no right to handle or receive enemy and puppet industries. In addition, the investigation team has issued an official document to the police and military agencies requesting the detention of Wang Zhuchen, but it has not been executed as of yesterday for five days.</p>
<p>[News Report] According to the spokesperson of the Receiving and Investigation Team: Because this team lacks administrative staff, if citizens have complaints in the future, they need to copy a duplicate to reduce the procedures of this team. If the content is an ordinary civil or criminal litigation or non-litigation event, and the petition is not within the authority of this team, this team may notify the plaintiff through the secretariat according to the Regulations on the Receipt of People's Petitions by the Supervisory Yuan and return the original. It is also stated that this team does not respond to cases, and the original plaintiff can inquire about the handling situation from this team in person if they want to understand the handling situation.</p>
<h3>Rong Desheng Petitions: Release Zhan Rongpei</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The verdict of Rong Desheng's kidnapping case will be announced after Commander Xuan approves it. Yesterday, Rong submitted a written request to release Zhan Rongpei, the factory director of Shenxin. The petition stated that Zhan was only representing the contact for ransom payment and was innocent. At the end of the document was the name "Citizen Rong Desheng." This request was submitted to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters at around 5:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Destruction of the Drug Trafficking Organization in Hequanfang</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The District Prosecutor's Office recently received a secret report that a large-scale drug trafficking organization was located at No. 32, Hehefang, Lin Sen Road. The district dispatched prosecutors to supervise the many clerks and judicial police, etc., and armed them to go there, arresting Zhuang Hongzhi, Zhu Debiao, Liu Guangzhi, Zhu Youcai, Zhang Wenying, Gong Xiuting and other men and women, while the principal criminal Zhu Qishan was at large and has not been captured. Two large packages of opiuim, weighing more than 20 taels, more than 30 gold bars of various sizes, and other decorations were found in the room.</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan's Reply: Hoping that the Municipal Government Will Get the Assistance of Citizens in the Future to Restore Shanghai's Past Glory as a Commercial Port</h3>
<p>Today, on Shanghai's historically significant memorial day, "August 13th," the first Provisional Municipal Council of Shanghai was established under the convocation of Mayor Wu. All members of this council took office under oath, with the presence and guidance of the heads of Party and government organs, Chinese and foreign guests. In particular, Mayor Wu, representing the Minister of the Interior, supervised the oath-taking and delivered instructions. Party Secretary Chen of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, Inspector Cheng, Dean Cha, etc., bestowed generous words of encouragement, which is deeply appreciated. I, having been erroneously elected by my colleagues, am honored to deliver this reply as a representative.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the center of China's economy and culture, and also a major metropolis in the world. Every move affects not only the entire country, but is also observed by the international community. Having been entrusted by 3.5 million citizens, taking a seat on the council to promote autonomy and assist municipal administration is a responsibility that truly fills me with apprehension. After eight years of enemy and puppet devastation, the material damage is immeasurable, while the corruption of customs and the decline of morality are even more heartbreaking. Now is the time when national construction is in need of the best. We deeply feel that the restoration work of this city is not limited to material construction, but must go further to eliminate all the toxins left by the enemy and puppets in the society in order to engage in psychological construction. However, after an unprecedented catastrophe, in terms of municipal construction, as the mayor said, we must all unite and work hard, thinking of the interests of the entire city, and earnestly engage in construction to achieve success. If we only rely on the government, its strength will be limited after all. If we do not mobilize all the citizens, gather strength, cooperate sincerely, uphold the spirit of supporting the Anti-Japanese War on August 13th nine years ago, and work hard for the construction and restoration in the future, it will not be enough to achieve complete success. Since we have been elected by the citizens and are supervised by the citizens, we must do our best to serve the city and the country, and fulfill our responsibility of expressing public opinion and participating in municipal administration.</p>
<p>After the restoration of this city last autumn, in March of this year, during the tenure of former Mayor Qian, a Provisional Council was established. Although it has only been four months, the Provisional Council has cooperated seamlessly with the government and society and made many contributions. Its achievements are obvious to all. Fortunately, the work of this council will have a good foundation in the future, and it will feel easier to promote it. We will also follow this example and continue to work hard. Mayor Qian, when the order of this city was roughly established and everything was waiting to be handled, compiled and reorganized the Baojia system and planned autonomy, so that the first popularly elected council of this city could be established one year after the victory. Today, we cannot but admire his administration, which is able to focus on the long-term and the big picture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Municipal Council is a deliberative body, and the Municipal Government is an executive body. The close relationship between the two is like the two wheels of a car or the two sides of an island. The reason why democratic politics can achieve brilliant achievements lies entirely in the good use of these two deliberative and executive bodies. In other words, the administrator must have the generosity to accept advice humbly, and then the politician can be a beneficial friend who is upright and knowledgeable. Only when the politician can make well-intentioned and positive criticisms can the administrator have a direction to rely on. Mayor Wu, with an open and honest and wise attitude, hopes for the cooperation of citizens in everything and is willing to respect the decisions of the Municipal Council. We are naturally obliged to contribute to the government with the public opinion of the citizens to be a sincere friend of the government. In the future, the municipal government and citizens will help each other, and the municipal facilities will accumulate day by day, creating a grand scene, attracting people from far and wide, and restoring the past glory of Shanghai as a commercial port in the near future and even surpassing it, which is our greatest wish. However, there are only 181 members of this council, and what we can see and hear is inevitably incomplete. We also hope that the local elders and social elites will give us advice at any time. We are looking forward to it!</p>

<h3>Today, Air Force Units Stationed in Shanghai Celebrate Air Force Day: Aviation Model Competition Awards Presented in the Morning</h3>
<p>Today is Air Force Day. All Air Force units stationed in Shanghai are taking a half-day holiday and holding commemorative ceremonies separately. At 7:00 PM, Colonel Guo Hanting, Commander of the Third Air Force District, and the heads of various Air Force units stationed in Shanghai will hold an evening party at the Jin Yu Restaurant on Nanjing West Road to receive the heads of various agencies in the city and representatives of the Allied forces.

<h3>Trial of Tianzhong and Six Other Criminals for Killing American Flying Tigers</h3>
<p>Lieutenant General Tianzhong Jiuichi, the former commander of the Japanese 23rd Army and former Governor of Hong Kong, who was accused by the US military court of killing US Flying Tigers Major John Hock, and his staff members, were publicly tried by the US military court in Tilanqiao yesterday. Tianzhong Jiuichi, who led the army to station in Hong Kong and killed innocent people, was extremely frustrated when he was tried yesterday, his eyebrows were tightly locked, and his eyes were dull under his tortoise-shell glasses. During the two-hour trial, he never raised his lowered head. Major General Fudichi Harunan, his chief of staff, was also accused of the same crime, but Fudichi's expression was very different from Tianzhong's. In an extremely uneasy situation, he still could not conceal the anger in his heart, and stared at the people in the court. Other Lieutenant Colonel Kuboki Hinode, Major Watanabe Masamori, Captain Yamaguchi Norikazu, and Captain Asakawa Hiroko also showed fierce appearances, giving the impression of "murderers." The presiding judge asked each of the defendants about their crimes, and the six people from Tianzhong below all loudly answered "Not guilty." The defendant's defense lawyer, Bao Ding, requested the court to grant him three days to prepare, and the retrial was scheduled for 8:00 AM on the 16th of this month.</p>
<h3>Huang Liewen Retried Yesterday for Persecuting Martyr Du Ganglie: Xi Yushu Testifies in the Case of Chen Jicheng</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Huang Liewen, the former puppet Qingpu County magistrate, was prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office for collecting white rice to harm the locality and secretly reporting to frame the former Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Department, Du Gang, and other crimes. The High Court has repeatedly held hearings for investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiu took the seat to inquire, and Du's wife, Lu Huiming, and Ms. Zhang Yulin, who witnessed Huang Liewen writing the intelligence report about Du Gang, were present to explain the process in detail. Huang's confession was quite contradictory and he flatly denied the premeditated secret report about Du Gang. He also said that he had contacts with underground workers and had three letters stored in Li Yejiqing's place, which could be used as proof. Li Yejiqing was then asked to testify, and he stated: He and Huang were classmates at Fudan University in 1928, so they knew each other. In May or June of last year, he had a few letters stored in his place, which were later confiscated by the Military Statistics Bureau. Witness Zhang Yulin testified: Her husband was doing underground work in Shanghai at the time and knew each other. At 4:00 PM on October 29, 1943, she went to Huang's house. Huang Liewen showed her a paper, which read "Intelligence, Du Gang has come to Shanghai from Tunxi, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department" and said to her: I can succeed in this matter, and my life can be solved. Because Huang was poor at the time and wanted to find something to do. A month after Du Gang was arrested, she and her husband were also arrested by the enemy's Gestapo on Jules Ferry Road. According to the translator in the team, it was all instigated by Huang Liewen. Du Lu Huiming stated: She and Du Gang were arrested at the same time on November 10, 1943. Du was killed on the 17th. She was detained for many days before being released. Now she has six children and her life is difficult. Huang accumulated wealth during the enemy puppet period. Can a civil lawsuit be attached? The court ruled that special criminal cases cannot be attached to civil lawsuits. The case was postponed for retrial, and relevant enemy gendarmerie will be summoned from the war criminal management office for cross-examination.</p>
<p>Also, in the case of Chen Jicheng, the puppet ambassador to Manchukuo, Xi Yushu and Ye Chuanxi testified yesterday afternoon that they were arrested by the enemy and puppets at the time, and the defendant tried to rescue them and was released. The court ruled that the case would be retried on another date.</p>

<h3>The Principal Criminal in Counterfeiting US Dollars, Swiss National Wei Delai, Arrested: The Cunning Rabbit Has Three Burrows, Repeated Serious Crimes, Maps and Codes Were Found, He is Actually a Traitor and War Criminal</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, a certain English newspaper in this city stated: Chinese and American police jointly searched a certain apartment at No. 54 Daxi Road, and the tenant lost millions of yuan in property. For this reason, the reporter specifically visited the spokesperson of the Garrison Headquarters. According to the report, the truth of the matter is as follows:</p>
<p>The Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters recently received a secret report from a certain foreigner stating: "A Swiss national named Wei Delai has committed serious crimes repeatedly. The counterfeit US dollars recently on the market were manufactured by him." After receiving the report, the Garrison Headquarters cooperated with a certain military agency. After a considerable period of investigation, it was learned that the suspect lived at No. 284 Youninggan Road, his wife lived at No. 54 Daxi Road, and he had an office at No. 83 Xieqiao Lane, using the stamp business as a cover. His relevant locations included the second house at No. 2423 Bailinan Road, etc. During the investigation, the US military also provided the suspect's criminal record in Shanghai for the past 20 years. It was decided to arrest this person at dawn on the 12th of this month, and a detailed search of his own residence, his wife's residence, his office, and several relevant locations revealed many pieces of evidence of the suspect's crime, which were largely consistent with what the original reporter said and the information provided by the US military. Except for those that are still under investigation and cannot be announced, the main ones are: (1) Evidence that he stole a huge amount of copper entrusted to the United States for safekeeping and sold it to the enemy for use. (2) Photos of counterfeiting my country's five-yuan stamps. (3) Original photos of Chongqing Longmenhao and Huangshan (Huangshan is the location of the Chairman's official residence) taken with a hand-held camera, enlarged photos, and a complete set of maps according to the size of the photos. (4) Special passes issued by the Special Service Class of the Japanese Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force and the Headquarters of the Japanese Enemy Third Fleet and Enemy Soldiers, and noting that he was allowed to take photographic photos, which are evidence of treason. (5) A letter from Lieutenant Hanabusa of the Enemy Naval Special Service introducing him to Lieutenant Colonel Omura of the Japanese Army Special Service for work, which contains many valuable secrets. (6) A manual written in code (under study). (7) Steel plates for manufacturing US dollars and parts of printing presses (this document is delayed due to time constraints). (8) Evidence that the suspect was expelled from Swiss nationality by the Swiss government for repeatedly committing crimes in various places.</p>
<p>A White Russian Refuses to Arrest and is Injured</p>
<p>In this case, the arrest and search were carried out by the Garrison Headquarters in conjunction with a certain investigation agency, and the foreigner who made the report issued a guarantee to the person in charge of the Investigation Department, and obtained the cooperation and assistance of the US Military Police Commander. Except for a few plainclothes personnel, the remaining Chinese and American personnel were all in uniform. When they arrived at No. 54 Daxi Road, the suspect's wife clearly knew that they were military police personnel, but after knocking on the door, she did not respond for a long time, apparently trying to destroy evidence. Therefore, the military police personnel took coercive measures to enter. At this time, a White Russian man dared to openly shoot to resist arrest. In order to protect himself, the action personnel mistakenly thought that this person was Wei Delai himself and immediately fought back, resulting in the man being shot in the leg and slightly injured (he has been sent to the hospital for treatment). After completing the inspection, all action personnel asked the inspected households to clean up and see if there were any lost items (only one family unreasonably refused to sign.) Each action personnel also checked each other's bodies on the spot and signed each other for the record. Therefore, the claim in the Western newspaper that the tenant lost his watch and US dollars is a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The suspect Wei Delai is currently under interrogation, and the other two White Russians who were arrested were found to be unrelated to this case and have been released.</p>

<h3>Hao Gengsheng's Return: Thoughts on Inspecting Northeastern Education: Extensive Damage to Northeastern Educational Facilities; Educational Reconstruction Will Be Faster Than in the Interior</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent] Hao Gengsheng, an inspector appointed by the Ministry of Education, arrived in Shenyang by plane on the 15th of last month, tasked with inspecting education in the Northeast. Last Saturday, Hao returned to Nanjing, and reported to the Ministry of Education on Monday (12th) morning. During the memorial week, he gave a brief report. A more detailed account of his inspection will be given during next Monday's memorial service. Our reporter inquired about his impressions of the inspection, and he responded as follows: Hao's trip was not for physical education inspection, but for inspecting the education situation at all levels in the Northeast provinces. In Shenyang, he inspected dozens of higher education institutions above vocational schools, as well as primary and secondary schools. After completing the inspection of higher education institutions, he gathered the students and gave them temporary lectures. The Northeast Temporary University remedial class is still providing remedial education. Some of the students from Northeastern University who had relocated to Sanhe during the war have returned to the school. The university's president, Zang Qifang, is actively preparing for reconstruction. He then inspected over a dozen universities and primary and secondary schools in Changchun. Previously, there were the Jian Guo University, the Institute of Technology, and the Medical College. Now, only the Medical College of Changchun University remains. The Ministry of Education has dispatched Director Huang Rujin to prepare for the establishment of Changchun University. Hao communicated with Huang, and Huang has already set off for Changchun to begin preparations for Changchun University. Next, he inspected education at all levels in Yongji. Yongji is the capital of Jilin Province. During the puppet Manchurian era, there was a Teachers' University. It is now planned to be reorganized into Changbai Normal College. The Ministry of Education has dispatched Fang Yongzheng to be responsible for the preparations. He then inspected seven or eight primary and secondary schools in Sipingjie. Sipingjie is a county town in northern Liaoning Province, formerly the center of the Japanese South Manchurian Railway warehouse area, and its education has appropriate facilities. He then returned to Changchun, transferred to Shenyang, and went to Beiping, where he met with colleagues in the education sector to discuss educational matters, after which he returned to Nanjing. Hao remarked that his impressions from this trip were as follows: Upon first arriving in the Northeast, he felt that the educational facilities had suffered extensive damage, and that reconstruction would be quite difficult, which caused him some concern. Later, after having extensive conversations with educators and staff actually engaged in educational work in the Northeast, and meeting with students for observation, his mentality suddenly changed. He found that the general enthusiasm of staff and students for reconstruction was extraordinarily high. If this pure mindset could be harnessed to collectively advance towards the future of education, reconstruction would not be difficult. He also realized that although there had been destruction in the past, the future reconstruction could utilize and restore the original foundations, making reconstruction not too difficult either. Based on the above two situations, he felt that if the effort were made in time, the reconstruction of education in the Northeast would be promising and faster than the general education construction in the interior. It is a matter of human effort. His initial feelings of worry turned into joy and a sense of hope.</p>

<h3>First National Education Demonstration Zone: Implementing Literacy Methods for the People</h3>
<p>The First National Education Demonstration Zone in this city, in order to comply with the implementation of the first phase of literacy education for out-of-school citizens and to increase the efficiency of various schools' implementation, has formulated the following methods:</p>
<p>Visual Publicity</p>
<p>A. (Slogans): Use proverbs or simple phrases to create slogans, with cartoons related to the meaning of the words attached to the top or bottom, to attract the reader's attention. The slogans should include: (1) Illiteracy is like being blind with open eyes, (2) Illiterates cannot be considered sound citizens, (3) Illiteracy brings a lifetime of suffering, (4) Illiteracy is truly suffering; many things cannot be done, (5) Workers who are literate can improve their work, (6) Farmers who are literate can improve agriculture, (7) Husbands should teach their wives to read and write, (8) Learn as long as you live, (9) Don't be afraid of being old, only afraid of not wanting to learn, (10) A family where everyone is literate is a truly happy family, (11) Not eating makes you hungry, but illiteracy is even worse, (12) If you didn't study in childhood, make up for it quickly in adulthood, (13) More knowledge brings more happiness, (14) Eating can satisfy hunger, but reading can clarify principles, (15) If you have the time, go read, reading has many benefits, (16) One word is worth a thousand gold pieces; literacy is most important, (17) Illiteracy is truly pitiful; you have to ask people about everything, (18) Literacy has many benefits; you can read newspapers and books, (19) Only with knowledge are you qualified to be citizens of a democratic country, (20) When the people have knowledge, the country will be strong. B. (Wall Posters): Wall posters should be published by August 15th, at least one issue, with at least two copies per issue, posted in prominent areas near the school. The content of the wall posters should include the key points of the central government's and the city's laws and regulations on the promotion of literacy education, as well as survey statistics and news related to literacy education, and the enrollment methods of the adult education classes in each school. Illustrations and charts should also be included to attract the reader's attention. C. (Pictures): Illustrate the significance of literacy and the suffering of illiteracy with large-scale illustrations, preferably compiled into a series of story pictures, and post them in key locations near the school or in public gathering places such as teahouses. D. (Advertisements): Explain the importance of literacy education in clear Chinese characters, then describe the enrollment regulations: age, gender, number of places, treatment, duration of study, class times, etc. The Baozhang and the Principal should jointly sign these enrollment advertisements, print many copies using mimeograph, and post them throughout the school's educational district.</p>
<p>Verbal Publicity</p>
<p>A. (Publicity Team): Each school should appoint one to three teachers (or rotate them) to lead a publicity team of several senior students or adult senior class students, forming one to three publicity teams. They should go to public gathering places in the educational district, such as teahouses and temples, to give public speeches and invite local people to assist them. The publicity team should have a small flag, a copper bell, and tools to summon the audience, such as a phonograph. They should bring copies of the enrollment advertisements and slogans to post at any time to attract public attention. B. (Lectures): In addition to the publicity team, each school should hold lectures on a regular basis and invite local Baojia leaders to participate. The location can be at the schools or at nearby public venues. It should be arranged in advance and, if possible, include performances such as parades, music, and slides to attract people.</p>
<p>Individual Persuasion</p>
<p>After the textual and visual publicity and verbal publicity, there are still out-of-school citizens who may hesitate to come forward, so individual persuasion should be implemented. The methods are as follows: (A) Encourage and introduce current students. If enrollment in the adult education classes in each school is insufficient, current students (children in older age groups and adult students) should be required to persuade at least one out-of-school citizen to enroll, and they should be given appropriate rewards. (B) Jointly persuade households with Baojia leaders. Based on the results of the survey of out-of-school adults in this district, if there are still many who have not registered for enrollment, the implementation measures for encouraging learning stipulated in this district should be followed. Baojia leaders should jointly persuade households to register on their behalf. If they still do not enroll by the opening date, the District Office should be notified to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Class Start Date</p>
<p>The adult education classes in each school in this district should comply with the regulations of the Bureau of Education and start classes by August 16th at the latest. The publicity period has already begun on August 5th and will last until the start date of classes. If there are still not enough students, persuasion should continue to be implemented to ensure that the required number of people is reached to meet the predetermined goals. Each school should fill out a report form (form attached separately) on the progress of publicity and enrollment by August 20th and report it to the district office for compilation and reporting to the Bureau of Education.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Education Department Stipulates Standards for Private Middle School Foundations</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Correspondent] The Ministry of Education previously issued revised regulations for private secondary schools, stipulating that the establishment of private secondary schools should be based on the principle that the sum of their assets, fund interest, and other fixed income (excluding tuition) is sufficient to maintain annual operating expenses.

In order to meet the needs, the Sichuan Provincial Education Department has specifically stipulated foundation standards and issued an order for all private secondary schools in the province to implement them. The standards are as follows: (1) A foundation of 20 million yuan is required to operate a six-grade junior high school; (2) A foundation of 25 million yuan is required to operate a six-grade senior high school; (3) A foundation of 40 million yuan is required to operate a six-grade high school; (4) An additional foundation of 4 million yuan is required for each additional senior high school class; (5) An additional foundation of 3 million yuan is required for each additional junior high school class.</p>

<h3>The Negotiation Process of the Petition Delegation: Agreement in Principle, Methods Still Under Study; Utmost Concern is Currency and Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Our reporter recently visited Mr. Pan Shihao, a representative of the Industry and Commerce Petition Delegation, and inquired in detail about the process of this petition to the capital. He provided detailed information regarding the five points: Separate taxation, foreign exchange, import and export trade linkage system, industrial loans, and direct and local taxes. Representatives from the government side agreed in principle on the two major principles of reducing the import of foreign goods and protecting domestic nascent industries. The Ministry of Finance believes there are two conditions! (A) While reducing the import of foreign goods, machinery and essential raw materials should still be opened up as much as possible. (B) The reduction of foreign goods imports should not stimulate domestic prices, as some in the government observe that the import of inexpensive foreign goods has some positive effect.</p>
<h3>Tariff Modification Certain; Export Taxes to be Completely Exempted; Fewer Freely Imported Goods</h3>
<p>In addition, the Ministry of Finance's opinions can be divided into the following three points: (1) In the international arena, the victorious nations plan to convene an international trade conference in London this October. Before the victory, these belligerent nations had already verbally agreed that free trade and tariff freedom should be implemented after the war. Therefore, tariffs can be revised, but not under the guise of protective tariffs to avoid international misunderstandings. (2) The current tariffs were set in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934). At that time, under the pressure of Japanese aggression, preferential treatment was given to the import tax on cotton textiles and paper. The Ministry of Finance has now decided to revise this. Furthermore, to encourage exports, export taxes will be completely exempted. (3) Before the tariffs are revised, it is planned to amend the current provisional measures for import and export trade to supplement them. The items on the Category A Table, Section 2, regarding items subject to a 50% luxury surcharge on current tax rates, and the items on the Category B Table, which are prohibited luxury imports, will all be increased. In other words, the number of freely imported goods will be reduced. Finally, the responsible person from the Ministry of Finance reiterated: The current tariffs do not conflict with protective policies and fiscal policies. Therefore, considering fiscal revenue, protective meaning should also be included.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs also has three points of opinion on tariff policy: (1) Increasing the import tax on luxury goods will definitely be implemented. However, there is concern that the increased tax still will not be able to balance the difference between the market for foreign goods and the market for domestic goods. Therefore, it is necessary to promote consumption and thrift domestically, which is the fundamental principle. (2) They hope that domestic goods will be used more and foreign goods will be used less. This is the same as the opinion of the delegation. However, due to the lack of domestic goods and the low purchasing power of the people, they do not agree with strictly restricting imports. As for the need to protect nascent industries, the situation should be examined closely, and different treatment should be given; a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate. However, in principle, the Ministry of Economic Affairs also agrees to provide appropriate protection to maintain national industries. (3) The Sino-American Commercial Treaty has now been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. Temporary commercial measures are also being drafted with Canada. It is reported that the principle adopted is still international free trade.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange is Not Easily Changed; Efforts to Avoid Stimulating Prices; Restrictions on Foreign Cotton, Implementing Cotton Loans</h3>
<p>The delegation believes that the current US dollar exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank has increased six hundredfold since before the war. American prices have increased three to fourfold since before the war, while domestic prices in our country have increased more than five thousandfold. Therefore, they earnestly explained that the unreasonable exchange rate creates a lower market price for foreign goods domestically and raises the excessively high price of export goods in foreign markets. Therefore, they believe that balancing international payments should start with balancing trade. The current foreign exchange policy is clearly inappropriate. However, any change in the exchange rate will stimulate prices, which is also undesirable. Therefore, they advocate adopting a foreign exchange tier system for the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods to increase their cost. The state can then use the income from this price difference to subsidize export foreign exchange. At the same time, the purchase price of export goods such as silk, tea, and tung oil in the domestic market should also be adjusted using tiered foreign exchange.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs also expressed agreement in principle with this proposal from the delegation. However, they believe that completely modifying the exchange rate now is not feasible. The implementation of tiered foreign exchange will be considered after consulting with the highest authorities and relevant departments, and the principle remains to avoid provoking foreign sentiment.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance believes that foreign exchange is still determined by the Four Banks Joint Treasury and the Central Bank. The Ministry of Finance also sympathizes with the idea of adjusting foreign exchange to protect the domestic national economy. However, the principle remains to avoid stimulating domestic prices and causing foreign misunderstandings. Furthermore, the delegation believes that foreign exchange futures are currently limited to three months. This short-term foreign exchange cannot help the import of machinery and heavy industrial products, but only induces the large-scale import of foreign surplus goods and luxury goods. They advocate remedying this. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance both attached great importance to this and promised to consider it. The delegation also noted that the current foreign exchange fund is limited, and cotton exchange settlements have exceeded 60% of the total exchange settlements. Textile mills currently have extremely abundant raw cotton inventories, but domestic cloth is more expensive than American cotton and no one cares. Therefore, they requested reducing the import of foreign cotton to cultivate the livelihood of cotton farmers. The Ministry of Economic Affairs indicated that it has decided to implement low-interest cotton loans and restrict the exchange settlement of cloth imports.</p>
<h3>Linkage System Generally Agreed Upon; Implementation Methods Awaiting Study; Import Linked to Export</h3>
<p>The delegation believes that in recent months, the trade deficit has been too large, not only oppressing domestic national industries but also depleting the purchasing power of the entire national economy. Therefore, they advocate an import-export linkage system: only those who export can import, and those who import must export. Although the amounts do not necessarily have to be equal, the principle is to promote exports and reduce imports. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance both strongly agreed with this. However, they feel that implementation is very difficult, because very few companies engage in both import and export. However, they consider the delegation's suggestion of establishing an adjustment mechanism to connect the exchange of import and export goods to be feasible. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance stated that they would consider more effective methods to realize the function of this linkage. They also said: This system was implemented in the rear area during the War of Resistance. However, at that time, it was necessary to link from exports to imports, such as tung oil and tungsten. Now that foreign goods are being dumped, it is even more necessary to link from imports to exports to ensure that international trade is close to physical settlement. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Bulls Sell at High Prices; Gold and Currency Prices Both Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the situation not being completely hopeless, the gold price slightly rebounded. It opened at 2,010,000, immediately encountered a wave of selling, and gradually weakened. It fluctuated greatly between 1,980,000 and 1,990,000 in the middle of the day. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 40 bars at a price of 1,985,000. Subsequently, the selling pressure gradually increased, and the price steadily declined in a peaceful state. At noon, it fell to 1,970,000 before stabilizing slightly. The afternoon remained sluggish, and the result was a decrease of 48,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold was reduced to 2,100,000. Pattern silver and silver dollars were flat. The implicit interest rate for call money remained at 10% to 13%.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange, including US dollars, also became dull. It opened at 2,630 yuan in the morning, but selling pressure increased and it declined. However, it struggled quite a bit around 2,590 yuan in the middle of the day. Later, the supply side became crowded again, and the gold market weakened and lacked support. At noon, it fell further to around 2,570 yuan. The afternoon continued to weaken slightly, resulting in a decrease of 70 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars initially stabilized and then weakened, falling from 585 yuan to 575 yuan. The result was also a decrease of 3 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers increased to 555 yuan to 565 yuan yesterday due to the reduction of telegrams. Indian exchange was 665 yuan to 675 yuan, with selling prices slightly reduced in the afternoon. British and American exchange rates remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Hong Kong gold prices yesterday were affected by Shanghai, with futures surging to 368.5 yuan. Based on this price, if the Shanghai telegraphic rate is calculated at 179, it is equivalent to a price of around 1,710,000 in the local market.</p>
<h3>Standardized Price Trading; Series Wu More Active</h3>
<p>Government bond trading was slightly boosted, with Series C and Wu being more active. Transactions reached more than one million yuan face value. Unified Series C opened at 640 yuan, and the price fell to a low of 620 yuan, but finally rose slightly to around 640 yuan. Unified Series Wu continued to advance and was already on par with Unified Series C. As a result, compared to the previous close, Series A, B, and C were all flat, Series D rose slightly by 20 yuan, and Series Wu alone rose by 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Meandering</h3>
<p>The situation of Chinese stocks yesterday was relatively stable, with a lot of meandering and no special changes. The highest prices in the middle of the day were 694 yuan for Yong Yarn, 3,950 for Meiya, 225 yuan for Jingfu, 223 yuan for Xinguang, and 170 yuan for Qinxing. The lowest prices near noon were 673 yuan for Yong Yarn, 3,780 yuan for Meiya, 212 yuan for Jingfu, 210 yuan for Xinguang, and 157 yuan for Qinxing. At the close, they meandered again. Futures trading for Yong Yarn and Meiya was slightly higher than the spot market. Interest rates were reduced to 9% to 12%. Xinguang was threatened by Jingfu, but Jingfu still took the lead in the end. Although trading was still active, most of the transactions were settled by transfer, and the momentum was very short, without breaking free from the meandering. As a result, compared to the previous close, the five major hot stocks - Yong Yarn, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing - all rose slightly. Among the less popular small and medium-sized stocks, except for China-France being flat and Shijie weakening, the rest all improved slightly. Veteran stocks were flat.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to hover at low prices. Without special stimulus, it is difficult to recover. Paper and steel industries had not fallen the previous day, and the market was slightly tighter yesterday. The rest struggled around the previous closing price, and the momentum was relatively stable. Jardine Matheson was more colorful because it was being absorbed by large yarn and flower traders. Transactions were still small. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson rebounded by half a percent, Beer and Guangya were slightly stable, Ewo Yarn and Yinglian were flat, and paper and steel industries weakened slightly.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Turn Flat; Grey Fabrics Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was unable to rise. Customers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other places did not continue trading and remained cautious, without continuing to purchase. Therefore, the various yarn counts became firm and then soft. The results varied, with ups and downs ranging from 5,000 to 10,000. People's minds were temporarily at peace.</p>
<p>Grey fabrics remained tight due to the depletion of spot goods. At the same time, the demand for fine cloth from private factories in Fujian, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and other places continued to come one after another. Therefore, 12-pound Dapeng cloth rose to 58,500 yuan, on par with the price of V-Dragon head cloth. Shilong cloth increased due to the increase in grey fabric, and the market price rose accordingly. The results were all increases of 500 to 1,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Brokers; Quotas to be Decided Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Stock Exchange convened its tenth preparatory committee meeting yesterday at 4:00 PM. After a three-and-a-half-hour meeting, the initial review of all broker applications was completed. Today, several committee members appointed by the general meeting will organize them. The eleventh preparatory committee meeting will be reconvened at 4:00 PM tomorrow afternoon to conduct a re-examination and decide on the quotas, which will then be submitted to the ministry for approval.</p>
<h3>Medium and Low Grade Early Rice Slight Decrease; Edible Oil Market Situation Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 5,000 dan of rice arrived in the North and South markets, with more medium and low grades. Stores selected high-quality ones, leading to high prices for superior rice and sluggish sales for inferior rice. Medium grade early rice decreased slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Early rice was also highly priced for good quality and sluggish for inferior quality. White Yuan goods were scarce and prices were flat. New early rice continued to decrease slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The number of goods arriving in the future is expected to gradually increase. Flour digestion was scattered and there was still no change. Foreign powder was also the same. Northern wheat still selected white wheat. Shantou, Xiamen, and Minjiang purchases were weak, and the trend was still to raise prices and kill inferior goods. Factories still rejected opening. New soybeans had some arrivals, and prices were stable. However, medium and inferior goods had no buyers and were reduced by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Due to the hot weather, the edible oil market had a lot of customers. Although goods from Qingdao did not flood in, factory supply was still acceptable, and the market was strong.</p>
<h3>Foreign Tea Firms' Sales are Thriving; New and Old Varieties are Accepted</h3>
<p>Domestic sales of red and green tea have not declined to this day. Foreign firms, especially British and Indian firms, are still more active. New Zhu-Chen from Wuyuan has already been opened by the Ruichang Foreign Firm, with a total of 20 boxes traded at a price of 220,000 yuan per dan. As for the new Zhu-Chen from Weiping, 27 boxes were absorbed by the Meixing Foreign Firm at a price of 240,000 yuan per group. As for old varieties, 40 boxes of old Zhen-Mei were purchased by the Xiehe Foreign Firm, 56 boxes of old Zhen-Zhen were purchased by the Wuchang Tea Company, and 50 boxes of Bai-Lin old red tea were purchased by the Deda-Chang Tea Company. Other tea firms have also been active, and the trend is consistent and stable. However, Bai-Lin old red tea was strongly raised by sellers, resulting in an increase of 40,000 yuan per dan. According to news from Indian firms, recently, there has been a tendency to accept all old special tribute teas. In terms of price, the most popular is between 44,000 and 45,000 yuan per dan. Other fine Taiwan red teas around 70,000 yuan are also in high demand.</p>
<h3>Next Quarter's Special Import Goods; Registration Deadline at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The import quantities of five kinds of specially permitted import materials, such as automobiles, kerosene, tobacco leaves, movies, and foreign sugar, are applied for quarterly, three months per term. The next quarter is October to December. The deadline for registration is the end of this month. The Import Management Office will still handle the applied quantities and methods in accordance with the regulations of the highest competent authority. The applicants are still limited to the importers who applied and were approved before March 25 of this year. If the imported quantity registered in the first phase cannot be purchased in full before the end of September of this year, the special reasons must be explained. If it is found to be true after verification, it will be deducted from the quantity applied for in the next quarter.</p>
<h3>American Demand for Chinese Carpets is Quite High</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 13th] According to Hodge, Director of the Oriental Carpet Institute, American demand for Oriental carpets is higher than expected. The institute is conducting a publicity campaign to increase Americans' appreciation of Oriental carpets. Currently, not only the United States, but also Mexico and South American countries need Oriental carpets. Although most of the imports from China are pre-war products, at least one batch of post-war carpets has been shipped. However, China's inflation has greatly increased costs, which has greatly affected the sales of Chinese carpets in the United States.</p>
<h3>Chinese Bonds Fall in London Market</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] In the foreign stock market, Chinese bonds fell by two to three pounds today due to the impact of the unstable domestic situation.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Joint Treasury Loans; Order to Strive for Improvement; Soliciting Handling Fees is Strictly Prohibited</h3>
<p>The Four Banks Joint Treasury, in order to improve loan procedures, has submitted to the Board of Directors for resolution: (1) Lending banks shall not require a bank guarantee from borrowers who have provided sufficient collateral in accordance with the regulations. (2) The government has regulations on handling fees for commercial firms, and it has been heard that there have been cases of extra solicitations recently, which should be transferred to the competent authority for thorough correction. It is reported that the above resolutions, in addition to the second item which has been transferred to the Ministry of Finance for investigation and handling, have also been telegraphed by the Four Banks Joint Treasury to the six general bank branches for compliance.</p>
<h3>Letters of Credit Not Allowed to Expire; Coal Exchange Must be Approved in Advance</h3>
<p>The Central Bank issued Notice No. 50 on August 12 to all designated foreign exchange banks, stating: If the goods of customers for which the designated banks have issued letters of credit cannot be completed within the time limit specified in the certificate, the expired letter of credit shall not be extended or a new certificate issued to replace the expired certificate or unused portion of the certificate without prior approval from the Central Bank. If a client applies for an extension of an expired letter of credit or requests the issuance of a new certificate for the same batch of goods, it must be approved by the Central Bank in each case.</p>
<p>On the same day, Notice No. 51 was issued to all designated foreign exchange banks, stating: From today, foreign exchange shall not be sold for the import of coal and coal dust without prior approval from the Central Bank, and each designated bank is requested to immediately telegraph its foreign branches to comply.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Submits a Request to Establish a Supervisory Office for Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Considering that China has a vast territory and the economic situation varies from place to place, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has decided to establish industrial and commercial supervision offices in Chongqing, Panyang, Pingjin, Shanghai, Taiwan, and other places to facilitate the development of industry and commerce, with specialists supervising and inspecting. All issues such as industrial plant plans, technology, raw materials, and management can be assisted or consulted on free of charge. On the commercial side, export surveys and foreign commercial intelligence will be conducted. This plan will be implemented after approval by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Cotton Cloth Shipped to Guangdong</h3>

The Lin-Sen ship arrived in Shanghai from Shantou yesterday, carrying more than 10,000 pieces of native sugar and spirit paper from Shantou, and more than 10,000 pieces of wood from Fuzhou.</p>
<h3>Britain Reduces Silk Tax; House of Commons Accepts</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] The House of Commons has accepted a clause in the Finance Bill amendment that reduces the purchase tax. The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that when proposing to reduce the purchase tax on natural silk from 100% to 33 and one-third percent, the distinction between natural silk, rayon, and other textile raw materials is difficult to identify. These amendments will therefore allow natural silk to become consistent with rayon. He also stated that the Ministry of Finance will increase the burden by one million pounds sterling annually due to the reduction of the purchase tax. The reduction of tax rates in the domestic market will assist the export trade of silk goods and maintain the employment problem in silk manufacturing areas.</p>
<h3>The First Air Force Day After Victory: Establishing a Foundation for the Air Force with Redoubled Efforts</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zhirou</p>
<p>August 14th is the day the fighting Chinese Air Force was born. Upon reaching this day, we are both moved beyond words and endlessly invigorated. Each year becomes a milestone for the Air Force, marking the progress of our endeavors and the merits and demerits of our personnel. It implicitly and sternly urges us to truly become steadfast protectors of the nation and its people. We have already passed nine August 14ths, which also means we have passed the officially designated sixth Air Force Day. For these nine years, every time this blazing season arrives, there have always been different issues requiring us to come up with different methods to consider and resolve; there have also been different circumstances requiring us to adapt and accommodate with different efforts. Therefore, what remains is a variety of recollections and reflections, and the path forward is correspondingly distant and tortuous, laborious and time-consuming.</p>
<p>One Equaling Ten, Ten Equaling a Hundred</p>
<p>On August 14th of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], thirty-seven days after Japanese warmongers committed arson, on the second day of the fierce Battle of Shanghai, the Chinese Air Force, relying on its wisdom, benevolence, and courage, and using its blood, sweat, and steel, created an August 14th with a thunderous roar that shattered the sky!</p>
<p>At that time, the entire force of the Chinese Air Force consisted of nine groups: three fighter groups, three light bomber groups, two reconnaissance groups, and one attack group, totaling 305 aircraft of various types. In terms of quantity, this was equivalent to one-third of the enemy's regularly deployed forces. In terms of quality, because the units were all newly formed and their training was not yet proficient, both personnel and equipment were scarce. Moreover, because we could not produce these things ourselves, all resupply was extremely difficult, and maintaining our forces became a constant source of anxiety.</p>
<p>We knew all of this, and we feared none of it, because we took "one equaling ten, one equaling a hundred" as our creed. The determination to sacrifice had long taken root in the comrades' ardent hearts. With the outbreak of the July 7th Incident, the Air Force's anti-Japanese sentiment rose to a fever pitch. The vigor of the morale, the conscientiousness of the mission, are memories that remain eternally clear and indelible. Based on this momentum, the radiant August 14th was produced, and the unprecedented absolute victory of the opening battle was achieved, defeating the elite Kisarazu Naval Air Group of enemy heavy bombers over the wilderness of Jiangsu and Zhejiang with a score of zero to six.</p>
<p>Fighting Day and Night, Preferring to Be Shattered Jade</p>
<p>In the following three days, our fighter units shot down as many as forty-six enemy planes in one breath. In addition, the battle results of the bomber and reconnaissance units were also equally fruitful and gratifying. During the early days of the "holding the hard positions to the death" era of the Eastern Theater, the Air Force was constantly fighting, day and night, preferring that the entire army be shattered jade rather than retreat even slightly. Thus, one after another, astonishing and tragic stories remained among the people, laying the foundation for the spiritual invincibility of our national army.</p>
<p>The second August 14th was spent living through the defense war of Wuhan on the Yangtze River. From the spring to the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], from Nanchang to Yichang, in order to defend the territory, to protect the military and civilians, and to vertically blockade the Yangtze River, the Air Force displayed commendable battle results to the world. At that time, enemy planes shot down in one instance were counted in "tens." For example, in the Battle of Hankou on April 29th, the Emperor's Birthday, ten enemy bombers and eleven fighters were shot down in one engagement. Aerial combat was at its most intense at this time.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the battle lines shrank into mountainous areas, and the Air Force's bases were moved to Sichuan. The seaports were blocked, supplies decreased daily, and the focus of work shifted to urban air defense, with sorties mostly being used opportunistically under favorable circumstances. At the same time, looking at the overall world war situation, the enemy's flames were raging, and the Allied forces were retreating steadily. China was isolated inland, and resupply from overseas was completely hopeless. Furthermore, as the Soviet Union was preoccupied with its own affairs, support gradually diminished. Thus, under the pressure of a large force, we struggled painfully, living through the third, fourth, and fifth August 14ths.</p>
<p>By the sixth August 14th of the 31st year [1942], the situation had gradually improved. The world-renowned American Volunteer Group, under the direct command of our commander-in-chief, fought alongside us as one, constantly striking the enemy. At the same time, regarding personnel training and equipment resupply, the United States, in the guise of the "arsenal of the Allies" and the "transport corps of the Allies," actively assisted us in preparing for the general counteroffensive.</p>
<p>From the seventh August 14th in the 32nd year [1943] to the eighth August 14th in the 33rd year [1944], the Chinese Air Force had transformed from a disadvantage to a balanced position, and further from a balanced position to an advantage. Taking the Battle of Changde in November of the 32nd year [1943] as the turning point, we reversed the years of passive beatings and changed to seeking out the enemy to fight. From then on, through the Central Plains Campaign (April 23rd to July 18th) and the Hunan-Hubei Campaign (May 27th to August 10th) of the 33rd year [1944], and the enemy's last-ditch Gui-Liu Campaign, the Air Force either coordinated with the army or independently launched attacks, participating in almost every battle and winning almost every battle. Until the days around the ninth August 14th last year [1945], the enemy surrendered unconditionally (August 9th). The Air Force's emissary of surrender first flew to the capital (the first of our planes landed in Nanjing at 4:00 PM on August 25th), gloriously achieving victory and completing the arduous mission.</p>
<p>General Zhou Zhirou, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force</p>
<p>General Wang Shuming, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force</p>
<p>Small Amount of Equipment, Large Amount of Spirit</p>
<p>Clearly, we were victorious in the war. The losses suffered by the enemy's air force far exceeded ours. Although our capital for combat was only our full spirit and half, or even less than half, of the equipment, the results we achieved, if measured by the power exerted by one person, one plane, and one bullet, demonstrated that we had indeed made the greatest effort possible. Over the eight years, with our small mobile force alone (the following figures do not include the Allied air forces), we dispatched planes in 4,027 batches, used 18,509 aircraft, shot down 568 enemy planes, likely shot down 117, damaged 602, destroyed 597 enemy planes on the ground, possibly destroyed 10, damaged 137, killed 38,282 enemy officers and soldiers, 3,800 cavalrymen, 5,472 warhorses, sunk 30 enemy ships (including one aircraft carrier), damaged 42, and damaged 252 other vessels, damaged 1,347, destroyed 1,584 locomotives and cars, and 5,123 other vehicles, damaged 1,103. In addition, we also performed many missions destroying enemy positions and behind enemy lines, as well as transporting supplies and providing cover for our front lines.</p>
<p>As for the total consumption of the Air Force's equipment during the eight-year war of resistance, including training and various items, it amounted to 597 tons of bombs, 10,240,000 bullets. Personnel deaths in aerial combat numbered 827, with 332 missing and 970 wounded or disabled; ground personnel deaths numbered 3,123, with 1,541 wounded or disabled. Altogether, there were 6,794 casualties. The death rate for flight officers was 24.3% (meaning that on average, approximately one in every four Air Force officers died for the country; if casualties are combined, then one in every two Air Force officers was either killed or wounded). The death rate for ground crew was 3.4%.</p>

<p>Ground Preparation for Aerial Activity</p>
<p>In wartime, everything is for the sake of combat, but without ground preparation, there can be no aerial activity. In order to carry out aerial defense, and for the sake of future military construction, even amidst extreme difficulties, we have not forgotten to devote ourselves to comprehensive construction. First, in terms of personnel training, in addition to the existing aviation school and mechanical school, we established an Air Force Staff College, a Non-Commissioned Officer School, a Communications School, a Youth School, and other various professional training classes. Especially importantly, due to the material supply and educational equipment, we sent multiple batches of students abroad for advanced studies. Since the 29th year of the Republic [1940], we have sent a total of 4,426 flight and ground crew personnel to the United States to study. Among them, more than 1,000 have returned to the country to serve, and a small number have caught up with the war and made military achievements. The rest are scheduled to return home by the end of next year. At the same time, we specially sent 220 mechanical personnel to the United States for the aviation industry and 51 to England.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of material equipment, with the evolution of the war situation, we had to transform from simple peacetime facilities to actual wartime facilities in an unpredictably short period of time. Furthermore, in order to save time, we had to abandon the Southeast sea and land transportation and confine ourselves to the interior of Western China. The haste of deployment and the difficulty of resupply made people feel that the entire Air Force was in danger of withering and suffocating at any time. But even in such an environment, we still mustered our courage and fought hard, and continued to actively build. In the eight years, we successively established 16 general stations, 154 large and small airfields, 19 aircraft repair factories, 34 equipment and ammunition depots, 171 radio stations, 354 air defense intelligence stations, 94 meteorological groups, and no less than hundreds of research, manufacturing, food and clothing, medical, engineering, and transportation institutions. As for the manpower and material supplies implemented to assist the Allied armies, these have not yet been included in the calculations.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there are the institutional and cultural constructions. The Air Force is a completely new product with a short history, and everything has no precedents to rely on. However, the Chinese young Air Force has two major characteristics that can serve as guiding principles for military construction: namely, accepting from the beginning (1) the technical essence of the United States, and (2) accepting from the beginning the commander-in-chief's spiritual instructions. Therefore, whether in flying, mechanical, legislation, or education, we seek to find concrete and feasible paths under these two seemingly incompatible but not contradictory principles. We hope that more reasonable and nationally appropriate things can be produced successively from this effort.</p>
<p>Regarding institutions, the important aspects we have been working hard to build include personnel systems, management systems, education systems, and supply systems. In personnel matters, the Air Force's attitude is "strictness first." All examinations, promotions, awards, transfers, and retirements are striving to be standardized, and we will never be careless. In management, the Air Force's policy is "openness first." We have not only eliminated the shameful monopolistic system in form, but also in the execution of financial, material, food, and allowance supply matters, failing to handle matters in accordance with regulations and verifying them has become an unimaginable nightmare. Other aspects, such as educational policies, aerial activities, technical supplies, land and air transportation, airfield facilities, and military law, military medicine, and general affairs, tangibly refer to the U.S. military, creating laws and regulations. Intangibly, we follow instructions and cultivate customs, always seeking to reduce malpractices and get on the right track, to build a foundation for the Air Force.</p>
<p>Promote and Expand, Perpetually Maintain Victory</p>
<p>Resisting Japan is our heavenly duty. Building the army is also our responsibility. Everything is to fulfill our mission, everything is for the sake of the greater good. At this time, when the good dream of victory is about to come true, and the nation's crisis rises again, we—the few Air Force comrades standing at the forefront of military power—should all conduct thorough self-examinations in all aspects and deeply awaken ourselves. First of all, we must recognize that the small achievements we have made in the past are not only insufficient to be proud of, but should also be regarded as regrettable compared to our Allied nations. What the people expect from us, and what the government relies on us for, cannot be said to be insincere. However, our construction and our military strength are truly too weak when considering the vast territory and population, and the importance of our position. Especially worrying is the technological backwardness, which is like a strong man compared to a child; the smallness of production, which is no different from a hair compared to firewood. Now that the strong enemy has fallen, but our own progress is stagnant, and we cannot keep up with the times, then if we want to guarantee security on our own and achieve our ideals in reality, the future will inevitably be uncertain. Thinking about this cannot help but make us feel heavy-hearted. All young and strong Air Force members with ambition, ability, integrity, and promise will definitely promote the spirit of resisting Japan and move towards the road of building the army on their own, so that the fruits of victory can be preserved forever and a great future can be anticipated. This is what we must warn each other about and use to encourage ourselves during this festive holiday filled with excitement and celebration.</p>

<h3>Air Force Message: A Brief Commentary</h3>
<p>The arrival of the first Air Force Day after victory coincides with the eve of the anniversary of Japan's acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration and the victory of the war of resistance. We remember the heroic martyrdom of our Air Force soldiers over the past nine years. As our mountains and rivers are restored and the enemy is defeated, we must first express our highest respect to them. The growth of China's modern Air Force has been very short. On the eve of the war of resistance, our Air Force's strength was really thin, and it was really incomparable to our powerful enemy at that time. However, under the conditions that our material conditions were inferior to others, our Air Force had glorious battles and sacrifices based on its heroic will and the spirit of serving the country, which is really the most precious page in our history of resistance. Today, we are happily celebrating the first Air Force Day after victory, remembering the heroic sacrifices of our Air Force soldiers who died for the country, and expressing our sincere condolences to their families. We hope that they can receive the comfort and care that the country should give them.</p>
<p>Now that World War II has ended, from the lessons of this war, we can clearly understand the importance of the mission undertaken by the Air Force in the entire war. Since the use of the atomic bomb, we have understood the importance of the Air Force's mission even more. How the war situation will be in the future, and how the realm of aircraft development will be, we cannot predict now, but in the establishment of modern national defense, the Air Force is undoubtedly a major part. Under this circumstance, we are excited to see the confirmation of the organization of the Air Force Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense on the eve of Air Force Day. We hope that our new Air Force Headquarters can actively shoulder the mission of developing our Air Force. That is the most meaningful action to celebrate or commemorate Air Force Day.</p>
<h3>The First Anniversary of Victory: A Review of Japan's Surrender - Our Newspaper's Archives</h3>
<p>On August 6th of last year, the United States dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Two days later, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. On August 9th, the second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. On August 10th, Japan formally requested Switzerland, Sweden, and the United States to convey to China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union its acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. By August 14th, World War II was declared over. On September 2nd, the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed on the USS Missouri, marking the official surrender ceremony. Ever since the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), Japan had been dreaming of a "Greater East Asia." Once awakened, all that remained was a shattered homeland and devastated territories. The aggressors truly found themselves in the tragic state of "reaping what they sow!"</p>
<p>After occupying the Japanese mainland, General MacArthur disarmed the nation, reorganized the government, dissolved the military and financial cliques, and supported democratic politics. All of these measures were intended to guide the Japanese people onto a new path. However, on the other hand, some were loudly proclaiming that Japan's latent war-making potential had not been eliminated, the power of the militarists had not been eradicated, and the so-called democratic parties were all figures who had previously been attached to the military. Time passes quickly. In just one short year, how the Allied nations have transformed Japan is what everyone is eager to understand. Today, we have specially compiled this article for review.</p>
<p>The Turnover of the Japanese Cabinet</p>
<p>The cabinet is the promoter of Japan's political future. The Potsdam Declaration stated: "A peacefully inclined and responsible government shall be established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people." But could the Japanese cabinet over the past year truly fulfill the Potsdam Declaration, follow General MacArthur's orders, and establish a democratic and peaceful nation?</p>
<p>It took half a month after the Emperor announced the surrender for the Higashikuni cabinet to be formed. Having a member of the imperial family serve as the head of the cabinet was an unprecedented event in Japanese history. There was a reason for this. When Japan surrendered to the Allied nations, it still requested to retain the Emperor's position. The Allied nations only agreed to conditional preservation. But although the Emperor had to obey the orders of the Allied Supreme Commander, at least within the country, he could still maintain his dignity. Higashikuni came forward to form a cabinet, wanting to use his status as a member of the imperial family as a rallying cry. However, the Higashikuni cabinet could not cooperate with General MacArthur's orders externally, nor could it meet the demands of the majority of the people internally, and it collapsed in just one month.</p>
<p>After the Higashikuni cabinet fell, the veteran diplomat Kijūrō Shidehara succeeded it. Shidehara had served as Foreign Minister during the September 18th Incident and was ostracized by the military. Shidehara's skillful approach seemed more clever than Higashikuni's. After forming the cabinet, under General MacArthur's supervision, he implemented the terms that Japan should fulfill after its surrender, revised the constitution, reduced imperial power, increased parliamentary power, promulgated election laws, and held general elections, as an initial step towards democratic politics. On January 4th, General MacArthur ordered the purge of figures within government agencies who had been involved with the military. Many people were implicated, and the Shidehara cabinet was shaken, with rumors of a planned collective resignation. As a result, on January 12th, the cabinet was reorganized, and six cabinet members whose names were on the blacklist resigned. Five new cabinet members were appointed after General MacArthur's approval. On February 12th, it reorganized again due to General MacArthur's [illegible] decree.</p>
<p>After the general election on April 10th, calls for the cabinet to fall rose one after another. The result of this election was that Japan had become a multi-party system, but none of the major parties could hold a clear majority. The union and dissolution of major parties were enough to determine the fate of the cabinet. The Socialist Party first demanded the collective resignation of the Shidehara cabinet, followed by a joint campaign by the Cooperative Party, the Liberal Party, and the Communist Party to overthrow the cabinet. In its statement, it stated: "The Shidehara cabinet must resign and consult with various parties to seek political stability." However, Shidehara clung to his position, saying that even a collective resignation would not help the political situation. In the end, he could not ease the calls for the cabinet to fall, and on April 22nd, he submitted his collective resignation to the Emperor.</p>
<p>After the Shidehara cabinet dissolved, the successor was not determined for a long time. A coalition cabinet could have been formed based on the results of the general election, but the Socialist Party insisted on the position of Prime Minister, so it did not succeed. On the 26th, representatives from the Liberal Party, the Socialist Party, the Cooperative Party, and the Communist Party held a joint meeting, and there was a strong possibility that Ichirō Hatoyama, president of the Liberal Party, would come forward to form a cabinet, but in the end, because the Progressive Party was excluded and the Socialist Party fought for the position of Prime Minister, the negotiations broke down. In early May, the four parties agreed that the Liberal Party would form a cabinet alone, and Shidehara officially recommended Hatoyama as the successor Prime Minister. However, General MacArthur said that Hatoyama had served as the Chief Secretary of the Tanaka cabinet, formulated measures to maintain public order, had served as Minister of Education in the Inukai Tsuyoshi cabinet, suppressed freedom of speech, thought, and assembly, dissolved agricultural and labor organizations, and had consistently supported authoritarianism and acts of aggression, and explicitly ordered his dismissal. The new cabinet was thus thwarted again.</p>
<p>After more than 20 days of preparation, on May 16th, the Emperor finally ordered Shigeru Yoshida to form a new cabinet. Yoshida had ceded the presidency of the Liberal Party to Hatoyama on the 15th, seemingly still being part of Hatoyama's faction. However, from 1939 onwards, Yoshida had always opposed Hideki Tojo’s intentions.</p>
<p>The Material Crisis and the Economy</p>
<p>In post-war Japan, there was a lack of resources, and the people's livelihood was in decline. The quantity of fixed rationed goods was only half of what it was before the war. Most wealthy people obtained supplies from the black market. The prices of food and clothing were rising every day. A five-inch long small fish cost more than ten yen (equivalent to six US cents). The black market price of rice was 32 times higher than the official price. People in rural areas were in a better situation because they were engaged in production. Residents of large cities were all under threat, especially with the severe food crisis. Although the police tried to search for hoarded goods, it was still not enough. There was also a great lack of housing. The population of Tokyo was only one-third of what it was before the war, but there was still not enough housing to distribute. After Japanese expatriates returned to the country, they encountered difficulties everywhere. Putting aside eating and clothing, the first problem was that there was no way to live. The employment problem could not be solved either. Currently, there are more than 700,000 unemployed people in Tokyo alone. But there is a strange phenomenon: everyone is unwilling to go look for a job. At that time, there were several factories in Tokyo that needed more than 30,000 workers, but only a few responded to the call. Most people would rather be "runners," traveling between cities and villages, selling goods from both places to make a living. Factory wages were not enough to fill their stomachs.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there was a material crisis, and on the other hand, there was inflation. According to Japanese economists in mid-February, the banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan had reached 60 billion yen, but in November of last year, it was only 28 billion. On February 16th, in order to solve the crisis, the Japanese government issued a strict economic control order to tighten the money supply, restrict deposits and withdrawals, crack down on the black market, and adjust prices. After that, prices fell slightly, but the material crisis remained the same. The United States proposed a plan to help Japan restore production and build small factories. The Far Eastern Commission also agreed with Japan's economic self-sufficiency. When the Control Council for Japan discussed the issue of managing Japanese finances, it mentioned export methods and agreed to consider supplying cotton to maintain its textile industry. This facility naturally has a great impact on our country's industry under construction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Japanese who made fortunes during the war still spend money like water, without any stinginess, and entertainment venues are booming. In the income tax list, geishas ranked first, and many good women became prostitutes. In several major cities such as Tokyo, anything can be bought as long as you have money. This is Japan's post-war deformed prosperity.</p>
<p>Is Japan Likely to Recover?</p>
<p>Whether Japan can no longer be a threat to East Asian peace is indeed a question. In terms of armaments, although Japan's military has been disarmed, it is not thorough enough; the police and gendarmerie have not been touched at all, and weapons have not been completely surrendered. In politics, the Privy Council and the House of Peers still exist. The results of the election show that the majority Liberal Party and Progressive Party are the incarnations of the Seiyukai and Minseitō in the past. Economically, although General MacArthur ordered the purge of companies such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Katakura, they were only divided into joint-stock companies, and the monopoly organizations still control the country's economic life. Japanese soldiers are still trying to take the opportunity to rise again, and remnants of the Black Dragon Society are secretly active. In the waters of Tokyo Bay, huge amounts of gold and silver ingots were discovered, prepared as capital for recovery. On the surface, Japanese soldiers have become docile sheep, but in secret, they are carefully plotting revenge. When the Japanese army concentrated in Xiamen returned to the country, on the walls of the Xiamen University—concentration camp—school building, they saw the slogan "We will be back in twenty years." In the hearts of the Japanese people, they seem to be sincerely convinced by the United States, but not so for us. The "Shibuya Incident" that recently occurred in Tokyo is clear evidence of this. In this regard, in addition to strengthening the control of Japanese education, we ourselves must also be vigilant and work hard at all times.</p>
<p>Because their views were not in agreement, for six years Yoshida was in the opposition. The Yoshida cabinet is dominated by the Liberal Party, with the Progressive Party occupying a minority, which has a somewhat conservative nature. The Communist Party once criticized Yoshida for supporting [anti-] China when he was the vice minister of Foreign Affairs, and should be dismissed in the same manner as Hatoyama. The mission of the Yoshida cabinet is only to pass the draft constitution in the parliament and strive to maintain the imperial line, which is extremely beneficial to the ruling class. As for the serious food crisis and inflation and other issues, there is still no solution. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on the 16th advocated the rapid establishment of a democratic [defense], to confront the conservative cabinet.</p>
<p>Political Tendencies Towards Democratization</p>
<p>Over the past year, Japan has been busy organizing new political parties, drafting a new constitution, and implementing universal suffrage. Optimistically speaking, Japan has embarked on the road to democracy, but some people are still skeptical.</p>
<p>Under General MacArthur's guidance, the Japanese democratic movement seems very active. Many newly formed political parties, all claiming to be democratic. Among them, the more powerful are the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party. The Liberal Party is the incarnation of the former Seiyukai, and the Progressive Party is formed with the original Minseitō members as the center, representing the conservative faction. The Communist Party represents the left wing. Because they could not carry out activities publicly in the past, most Japanese turned to the Socialist Party, and their strength is not very large, but their radical views are also agreed upon by some people. The Socialist Party is between not left and not right. The remaining small parties are weak. Before the general election, Nozaka of the Communist Party advocated a united front, uniting the Socialist Party and other small parties to take unified action. But as a result, the Socialist Party did not join hands with him.</p>
<p>The political system is built on the constitution, and to reform politics, it is necessary to start with reforming the constitution. General MacArthur stated on September 12th of last year that the Japanese constitution must be revised. The Japanese government then engaged in revision, and on March 6th, it published a draft of the new constitution. The main points of the new constitution are to clearly limit the powers of the Emperor, establish the principle of popular sovereignty, stipulate the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers, and compared with the old constitution, it can be called progressive. After the draft of the new constitution was drafted, all political parties had opinions to express. In addition to the Liberal Party expressing full agreement, the Progressive Party and the Socialist Party were also generally satisfied, and the Communist Party raised many opinions. They are fundamentally opposed to retaining the Emperor system. Internationally, much attention was paid to Japan's new constitution. China and the United States generally agreed, while the Soviet Union raised several opinions and questioned the Far Eastern Commission. The Far Eastern Commission held a special meeting on July 2nd to conduct a final review.</p>
<p>After the activities of political parties and the revision of the constitution, the next step was to implement universal suffrage. The universal suffrage was originally scheduled to be held on March 30th, but in order to strictly review the qualifications of candidates, it was postponed to April 10th. This can be said to be Japan's first free election, and women, who have always been excluded, also gained the right to vote. The competition among the various parties was very heated. The election results showed that the Liberal Party won 138 seats, the Progressive Party won 95 seats, the Socialist Party won 92 seats, non-partisans won 83 seats, various small parties won 38 seats, the Cooperative Party won 14 seats, and the Communist Party won 5 seats. Afterwards, General MacArthur said that this election opposed the extremist faction and elected the central faction, and this is the [cabinet] most capable of serving the people. From this, it can be seen that democratic politics seems to be developing soundly in Japan. However, all parties are very critical of General MacArthur's activities, and the Soviet Union is particularly critical. At the meeting of the Control Council for Japan, the Soviet representative said that Japan's old politicians have not disappeared, and the Soviet Union alone expressed dissatisfaction with this election.</p>

<h3>The Japan of the Past Year: Remnants of Aggression Eager to Stage a Comeback; Allied Nations Should Immediately Strengthen Vigilance</h3>
<p>— Jia Nan</p>
<p>At 7:00 PM on August 14, 1945, President Truman officially announced Japan's surrender at the White House, thus ending the devastating Second World War. The world rejoiced, especially the Chinese people, who had suffered from Japanese aggression for eight long years. Their hearts were filled with mixed emotions of grief and joy, the depth of which could not be described in words.</p>
<p>Regarding the terms of Japan's surrender, they were clearly stated in the Potsdam Declaration. Briefly, they included the following points: (1) The authorities and other forces that deceived the Japanese people and misguided them onto the path of world conquest must be permanently eliminated, and militarism must be eradicated. (2) Allied forces must occupy Japan until practical proof is established regarding the establishment of this new order and the destruction of Japan's war-making power. (3) The provisions of the Cairo Declaration must be implemented. (4) The Allies have no intention of enslaving the Japanese nation or destroying the Japanese people, but all war criminals must be severely punished. The Japanese government must foster democratic tendencies among the Japanese people and remove all obstacles hindering such tendencies... Japan must unconditionally accept these terms without any alteration.</p>
<p>Today, a full year has passed since Japan's surrender. To what extent have the terms of the Potsdam Declaration been implemented? What kind of situation does Japan's political landscape present? Which direction is Japan heading? Is it possible for the aggressions of militarists to make a comeback? I believe these are issues that the Chinese people are very concerned about.</p>
<p>Now, let us provide a brief overview of the political developments in Japan over the past year since its surrender.</p>
<p>Disarmament of Japanese Forces</p>
<p>The first task that the Allied nations should undertake after Japan's surrender was, of course, the disarmament of Japanese forces in various locations. Generally speaking, this task has progressed quite smoothly. Most of the military personnel and civilians abroad have also been repatriated, allowing them to engage in peaceful work. However, whether the militaristic ideology deeply ingrained in the minds of the Japanese people has been completely eliminated remains a major question. It is said that secret military organizations are still quite active within Japan. For example, the plot to assassinate General MacArthur before Labor Day, the recent abuse and murder of Taiwanese compatriots by Japanese police, and the secret activities of Japanese women in Taiwan all demonstrate that the Japanese government and people may appear obedient on the surface, but harbor different intentions in their hearts. The Allied authorities, especially the Chinese government and people, must pay close attention to this! As for the severe punishment of Japanese war criminals, it has not been carried out thoroughly enough. Although the main war criminals have been tried in international tribunals, the secondary ones are still at large, even holding important positions in government and civilian organizations. Although General MacArthur has issued approximately three thousand directives in the past year, many of which are related to purging official corruption, the Japanese government always outwardly complies but secretly resists, engaging in perfunctory and irresponsible actions. In particular, the Japanese zaibatsu (financial cliques), who bear a great responsibility for the war, still control the real power of the Japanese economy. The Japanese government even proposes subsidizing their wartime losses, which is truly a fanciful idea. From this, one can also see the true attitude of the Japanese government. Of course, it is like seeking fish on a tree to expect the Japanese people, who have been influenced and poisoned by the militarist ideology of war lords for nearly a century, to change overnight. However, whether they can fundamentally change and embark on the path of democracy in the future, especially whether enlightened individuals can gain a leading position, is something that deserves our close attention.</p>
<p>The Issue of the Emperor's Continued Existence</p>
<p>Secondly, the issue of the Emperor's continued existence has also caused a great uproar both inside and outside Japan. Some countries among the Allies advocated abolishing the Emperor, with Australia and New Zealand listing him as the number one war criminal. However, other countries believed that this issue should be decided by the Japanese people themselves, without the Allies overstepping their authority. As for the opinions of various political parties and the public in Japan regarding this issue, the conservative Progressive Party and Liberal Party naturally advocated maintaining the Emperor system. Although the Socialist Party agreed to limit the Emperor's great power, it did not advocate completely overthrowing this system. The Communist Party was the most vehemently opposed to the Emperor, but after seeing the fact that the Japanese people did have a blind faith in the Emperor, it also recognized that a violent policy was not the "only method" to overthrow the Emperor system. Therefore, it advocated separating the overthrow of the Emperor from the abolition of the imperial line, and said that the latter could be decided by public opinion. As for the opinions of the Japanese public, the Japan Public Opinion Research Institute conducted a survey in early February of this year, soliciting views from all sides. Among the 2,400 responses received, only 15% advocated "maintaining the Emperor's current status." 45.5% advocated placing the Emperor outside the political arena, as the patriarch of the nation and the center of morality, and maintaining him. 45.9% advocated conditionally restricting the imperial system and reducing the Emperor's power. 9.9% absolutely opposed the Emperor system.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to the current situation, although the imperial system is a product of feudalism and has had a close relationship with the aggressive policies of the former Japanese warlords, it is probably impossible to completely abolish it at this time. In fact, the focus of the issue is not whether the Emperor exists or not, but whether the Japanese people want to use the preservation of the Emperor as a way to maintain the foundation of Japanese aggressive ideology, and stage a comeback after the occupying forces withdraw. We should be vigilant about this possibility at all times.</p>
<p>Draft Constitution of Japan</p>
<p>According to Japan's recently drafted constitution, the Emperor system is still preserved, but all the Emperor's ruling powers have been abolished. The parliament is the highest organ of the state, and it particularly emphasizes that sovereignty belongs to the Japanese people. From the text, this draft constitution seems to be very respectable and has the democratic style of Anglo-American countries. However, based on general experience, especially the habits of the Japanese people, saying nice things is one thing, but whether actions are consistent with words is another. Therefore, instead of focusing on the draft constitution of Japan, we should pay more attention to what kind of cabinet will implement this constitution.</p>
<p>The several cabinets since Japan's surrender have been unsatisfactory. The Higashikuni cabinet was extremely weak and incompetent, and many of its members were responsible for the war, including Konoe, who initiated the war of aggression against China. Therefore, it collapsed after only about a month. Succeeding Higashikuni was the Shidehara cabinet, whose main figures were Shidehara himself and Foreign Minister Yoshida. Shidehara and Yoshida were previously regarded as democrats, but in reality, this was not the case at all. In the past, they opposed the warlords to some extent, but not because they were demanding democracy, but because of the power struggles within the ruling class. The Shidehara cabinet greatly hyped up the parliamentary elections held in April of this year, believing it to be an important step for Japan to move towards democracy. At the time, some people believed that holding elections in Japan at this time could not represent the true intentions of the public, because the Japanese people had not yet reached true awakening. As a result, conservative parties could take this opportunity to exploit it. However, the elections were held as scheduled. In the number of seats, the Liberal Party won 139 seats, the Progressive Party won 93 seats, the Socialist Party won 92 seats, independent candidates won 83 seats, various small parties won 38 seats, the Cooperative Party won 14 seats, and the Communist Party won 5 seats. Judging from the number of seats, the conservative parties had a great advantage. Furthermore, the Liberal and Progressive Parties, which won the most seats in this election, are the embodiment of the Seiyukai and the Minseito, respectively. These two major parties have been alternately playing the leading role on the Japanese political stage for nearly a century, and they should bear great responsibility for this war. However, in the postwar Japanese politics, they still hold an extremely important position. How can this method of putting old wine in new bottles allow Japanese politics to embark on the right track of democracy? How can a democratic constitution be implemented?</p>
<p>Japanese Political Party Activities</p>
<p>After the general election results were announced, the Shidehara cabinet should have stepped down long ago, allowing Ichiro Hatoyama, the leader of the Liberal Party, to form a cabinet. Hatoyama is a thorough opportunist who previously made pro-Axis remarks. After the war, he used democracy as his banner, but was eventually dismissed by General MacArthur. For a time, the Japanese political situation fell into a state of impasse. Seeing this situation, Shidehara believed that there was an opportunity to take advantage of it. On the one hand, he used his illegal power to refuse to recommend the leader of the Socialist Party to serve as prime minister. On the other hand, he himself took the position of leader of the Progressive Party and secretly contacted Yoshida, instigating him to take the position of leader of the Liberal Party, advocating the merger of the Liberal and Progressive Parties, with Yoshida as the prime minister. He himself still pulled the strings behind the scenes, directing everything, and ensuring the strength of the conservative elements. The twists and turns of the cabinet formation process at that time fully revealed the painstaking efforts of the conservative elements. It was truly a pathetic and quite tense scene! As of now, Yoshida is still the Prime Minister of Japan. On the surface, he tries his best to listen to General MacArthur, so many Americans believe that the Japanese have already embarked on the path of democracy. However, the Chinese, who have suffered greatly at the hands of the Japanese, dare not lightly believe their superficial behavior, especially after understanding the ins and outs of the Japanese political situation. Even more so, they must be extremely vigilant.</p>
<h3>The Mysterious Emperor Suddenly Appears in His True Colors.</h3>
<h3>One Week of Victory: A Retrospective of the Historical Fact of the Japanese Government's Surrender; The Atomic Bomb is the Death Knell of the Japanese Military Junta</h3>
<p>— Xun</p>
<p>On August 14, 1945, amidst the Allied forces' preparations to invade the Japanese mainland, President Truman suddenly announced to the world that the Japanese government had accepted the terms of the Potsdam Agreement. The Second World War was thus declared over.</p>
<p>However, the formal surrender ceremony was not held until September 2, 1945, when representatives of the defeated enemy nation signed the surrender document on the American battleship USS Missouri.</p>
<p>This war had been going on for more than eight years since Japan's attack on China. From the American side, Japan's surrender ended a war that had lasted for about three years and nine months. The American-Japanese war began on December 7, 1941, the day the Japanese army attacked Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>After the Pearl Harbor incident, Japan established the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere", and its work of plundering land was quite successful. The Japanese army swept through the Philippine Islands, Indonesia, Malaya, Burma, the Pacific Islands, and most of Chinese territory. At the height of the Japanese military's power, the area occupied by the Japanese army reached four million square miles, with a population of 550 million. However, it should be pointed out that the people in some areas continued to resist the invaders, engaging in open guerrilla warfare from time to time, or using more passive methods such as sabotage and non-cooperation.</p>
<p>As the army increasingly expanded its occupied areas, the United States began to unleash its industrial potential. Peacetime production work was changed to wartime factories, and huge new aircraft factories and shipyards were successively established. Millions of men and women were mobilized, not only joining the armed forces, but also joining the powerful agricultural and industrial production front.</p>
<p>By the summer of 1945, the Allied forces were not far from Tokyo. At that time, the Philippines had been liberated and had become a major strategic area for advancing into the Japanese mainland. Iwo Jima and Okinawa had been captured. The Third and Fifth Fleets patrolled the Pacific and Chinese seas, and could sail close to the Japanese coast at any time to bomb its strategic strongholds. The Japanese fleet had been severely damaged. Due to the activities of American submarines and aircraft, the Japanese merchant fleet had encountered a terrible fate. The super-fortresses taking off from the Mariana Islands had systematically destroyed Japan's largest industrial areas.</p>
<p>On July 26, 1945, President Truman and British Prime Minister Churchill signed the Potsdam Agreement, which was immediately sent to Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and approved by Chairman Chiang. Later, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and also agreed to the agreement.</p>
<p>The Potsdam Agreement required Japan to accept the following conditions: Japanese leaders who misled and instigated the people to engage in war should be immediately removed. The Allies would occupy Japan. Japan's territorial sovereignty would be limited to the Japanese mainland islands. The Japanese army should liberate all territories. Unconditional surrender. Acceptance of legal sanctions for severely punishing war criminals.</p>
<p>Then August arrived, and the final blows that forced Japan to surrender followed one after another. On August 6, the first atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima. Two days later, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. On August 9, the second atomic bomb bombed Nagasaki.</p>
<p>On August 10, after a meeting of Japanese senior officials, Japan's Domei News Agency announced the original text of the Japanese government's memorandum to the Swiss government, saying that Japan was prepared to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, but with the understanding that the Potsdam Declaration did not require the deprivation of the Japanese Emperor's sovereignty.</p>
<p>On August 12, the Allied governments replied that the Emperor should be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces.</p>
<p>On August 14, the Japanese Domei News Agency released the news that the Allied forces had approved the Japanese government's surrender. The next day, the Emperor read the edict, declaring his decision to surrender to the Japanese people. On August 19, representatives of the Japanese government flew to Manila to discuss the issue of the Allied occupation of Japan with General MacArthur's representatives. On August 22, General MacArthur, then the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, announced the timetable for the Allied occupation of Japan, which was subsequently implemented as scheduled. General MacArthur himself flew to Japan with the first batch of Allied forces to be stationed in Japan, landing at Atsugi Airfield near Tokyo. Japan then formally surrendered unconditionally on September 2. In the legendary two thousand years of Japanese history, this day left it with its first defeat. The world's attention was focused on the battleship Missouri, where the surrender ceremony was held.</p>
<p>After signing, General MacArthur said to the Japanese: "I, in my capacity as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, hereby declare that I represent the Allied nations' firm determination to supervise Japan's implementation of the surrender terms. I will fulfill my duties with fairness and firmness to ensure that the terms of Japan's surrender are implemented one by one."</p>
<p>The Japanese representative announced the abandonment of the following territories: China, Taiwan, Vietnam above latitude 16 to be handed over to China; "Manchuria", Korea north of latitude 38, and Sakhalin Island to be controlled by the Soviet Far East Army; Andaman Islands, Nicobar Islands, Burma, Thailand, Malaya, Borneo, Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, Bismarck Archipelago, Solomon Islands, and Vietnam south of latitude 16 to be controlled by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia; Japanese-mandated islands, Ryukyu Islands, Ogasawara Islands, and other Pacific Islands to be controlled by the Commander of the US Pacific Fleet; all islands belonging to Japan, Korea south of latitude 38, and the Philippines to be controlled by the Commander of the US Army.</p>
<p>The dream of Japan sweeping through the Pacific region was thus awakened, and the Japanese Empire also came to an end. Its mainland was also under Allied occupation. This occupation was intended to teach the Japanese people the ways of democracy and peace, so that they would abandon the militarism that led to the war. Japan finally defeated and surrendered unconditionally.</p>

<h3>September Clothing (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— A Layman</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>A yellow leaf flutters down from the treetop, and the wind and rain gradually increase.</p>
<p>After a minor illness, I walked onto the street for the first time, and everything seemed new to me. The most vibrant colors were veiled in a light mist, appearing dull. Young women no longer wore pale green or light red silk, but instead favored gray-blue fashions to create a softer visual harmony.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, I looked down at my own clothes. Although they were neither torn nor old, they were undeniably out of style. Watching others constantly adjusting their new garments, I suddenly felt the urge to have an autumn outfit made for myself. I began to assess my financial situation, knowing that it would be impossible to free up the necessary funds within a month. But if I waited another month, the fashion-conscious city dwellers would likely be putting away their autumn attire and donning warm early winter outfits.</p>
<p>An invisible force urged me to hurry home. I ran all the way to the bedroom, where my wife was habitually lying on the bed fully clothed, greeting me with a smile. I sat on the edge of the bed, taking her hand. She suddenly laughed freely, a laugh like an adult giving to a child, containing both teasing and disdain. She often laughed at me that way. In her eyes, I was like a child, ignorant and constantly in need of a woman's assistance and encouragement.</p>
<p>"Please don't laugh like that anymore, okay?" I almost pleaded. But her laughter did not stop. She said,</p>
<p>"Even though you think you know a lot, your heart is always reflected in my eyes. You must be thinking about getting a new outfit now."</p>
<p>It was strange; she always knew what I was thinking without me having to say it. I said,</p>
<p>"It's good that you know. I really want to, but I don't have enough money right now!"</p>
<p>"Ask me!" she said coquettishly. "I'll give it to you as a reward!"</p>
<p>"No, I won't ask you. I'll find a way myself."</p>
<p>"Don't be so stubborn, child (Heavens! Child again). You should understand that if you didn't spend all your money on books and entertainment..."</p>
<p>"In five days," I stood up and said, "I will present you with two new outfits."</p>
<p>I may have said that, but I had no confidence whatsoever. A ridiculous sense of pride compelled me to make that promise.</p>
<p>"That sounds nice," she said, smiling casually. "But you never seem to keep any of the promises you make."</p>
<p>My face turned red. Like a child, I grabbed her arm. She laughed and said,</p>
<p>"Alright, you're resorting to your last trick. Aren't you ashamed?"</p>
<p>I couldn't say a word. For some reason, I blushed easily in front of my wife, even though she was two years younger than me. I often looked to her for ultimate comfort, so I felt respect and dependence towards her in addition to love.</p>
<p>"There's nothing more to say. I advise you not to be stubborn. There's nothing shameful about asking your wife for money."</p>
<p>"No, definitely not!" I said resolutely. "Five days from now!"</p>
<p>The fallen leaves in the courtyard only increased, and the sun was nowhere to be seen each day.</p>
<p>And so, one day, two days, three days, finally four days passed. I had not found the money. In fact, I never really "planned" properly, because I never borrowed money, nor did I have the ability to speculate or deceive. I could only sit and wait for money to fall from the sky. But it seemed that nothing ever fell from the sky except bombs and such. Then I realized that there was no such thing as a free lunch in this world. If you wanted something, you had to pay the price, whether with knowledge or strength, honesty or deceit.</p>
<p>Every evening when we met, we never mentioned the matter, only exchanged heartfelt glances. She still often smiled at my awkwardness, and I, in turn, could only force a smile.</p>
<p>It was the evening of the fifth day, the last day. I slowed my pace as I walked home, feeling a primal fear and unease. I wished I could avoid going home that night, or go home without seeing my wife. But in reality, I had to go back, and I had to see her. So, like a child, I tried to delay the inevitable. I went to visit a friend.</p>
<p>The gentleman happened to be out. The servant said he would be back soon, and told me to wait. So I sat down, turned on the light, and flipped through a few magazines. Autumn days were short, and the sky quickly turned completely dark. I stood up and stretched, just as I heard footsteps. My friend had returned. He was an amiable, overly-kind person, easy to make friends with but quick to break them off. But if you had a long-term, unbroken friendship with him, he would become a friend for life.</p>
<p>"Ah, I've kept you waiting," he said, warmly clasping my hand and putting his other hand on my shoulder, pushing me down onto the sofa.</p>
<p>"Where were you coming from?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Visiting a friend in an antique shop, and looking to see if there were any interesting jade stones. You know, I like playing with these things."</p>
<p>"I've heard about it," I said, smiling. "Did you find any good antiques today?"</p>
<p>He smiled, lit a cigar, and habitually reached up to touch the scar on his forehead. Then he leaned back deeply into the sofa, exhaled a puff of smoke, and said,</p>
<p>"I never believe in antiques. I just buy whatever I like."</p>
<p>"You must have quite a collection of those things?"</p>
<p>"Quite a few. I'll show you later when we go upstairs," he loved to mention this, his face lighting up with excitement, making the scar on his forehead even more prominent. "But today I got another good thing. Take a look."</p>
<p>He carefully took it out of his pocket. I took it and saw it was a jade bangle, with vibrant colors. It looked very valuable. It seemed like my wife also had one that was similar to this one. They would make a good pair together. I thought about buying it to give to my wife, to make her happy. I said,</p>
<p>"How much did you pay?"</p>
<p>"Five taels," he said casually. "They gave it to me at cost, as thanks for helping them make a sale they'd been working on for two or three years."</p>
<p>I was surprised that a plain jade bangle was worth so much.</p>
<p>"My wife also has one that's about the same."</p>
<p>"Then take this one back and give it to your wife, and just make it a pair. Consider it a preemptive baby shower gift."</p>
<p>"No need," I said. "You bought it because you liked it. How can I ask you to part with it? Or else, I'll buy it from you."</p>
<p>"Sell? I never sell things," his eyes widened, the scar seeming to swallow people up. He stood up angrily. I quickly said,</p>
<p>"Don't misunderstand. It's because I can't accept such a valuable gift from you for free, so I said I'd buy it. If you insist on refusing, then it doesn't matter. We can talk about it later. Fortunately, although life is short, there are still many opportunities to settle debts of gratitude, love, and hatred!"</p>
<p>He laughed happily. Then the bangle was stuffed into my pocket, easily considered mine, and would later be my wife's. She could now complete a pair, and she would be so happy that she would fall into my arms, repaying me with her adorable smile.</p>
<p>I cheerfully said goodbye to this kind friend.</p>
<p>I walked down the road excitedly. I had an excuse now! Look, I originally had money to make clothes, but I bought you a bangle instead. Then she would admire and thank me, and it wouldn't be as shameful to take her money to make clothes.</p>
<p>At this time, every street lamp smiled at me, everyone was amiable, the whole world was warm and gentle, and the autumn evening breeze was delightful. I accidentally bumped into someone, and I quickly apologized (normally I might have gotten angry). The person also asked me with a similar gentle attitude. At this moment, it was hard to believe that there was any strife or quarreling in the world. Understanding and peace pervaded between people, love ruled the universe, and I vowed to never be cynical again.</p>
<p>An ordinary gift could move a person this much, but why were people, including myself, so stingy?</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>I pushed the door open and entered. My wife was still lying on the bed fully clothed, smiling at me slightly as usual. I was about to speak, but I froze. Look, there were two brand new outfits neatly folded on the bed, dark blue and dark gray, my usual favorite colors and materials. I stood there speechless. My wife got up from the bed, walked over, took my hands, and, revealing the most adorable smile in the world, said,</p>
<p>"Although it's not the highest quality, I hope you'll accept it, seeing as it comes from the sincerity of my heart." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Riverside Fisherman (Selected World Famous Paintings)</h3>
<p>— By Alphonse Legros (1837-1911)</p>
<p>Collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London</p>
<p>Alphonse Legros was originally French, but later naturalized as a British citizen.</p>
<p>Legros was born in Dijon. His father was an accountant. He often went to the countryside to visit relatives; the farmers and landscapes he saw became the subject matter of many of his later works.</p>
<p>He first received artistic education at a school in Dijon, and later studied with a painter. In 1851, he went to Paris to study painting with the landscape painter Camille Corot. In 1857, his portrait of his father was exhibited in the Paris Salon.</p>
<p>In 1863, he went to England; the following year, he married an English woman and supported himself through etching and teaching. He taught copper engraving at the South Kensington Art School, and later taught at the university for seventeen years, influencing many students. Therefore, Legros was not only an excellent painter but also a good professor. —Attached note by Cheng Lu</p>
<h3>Past Traces</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>I wander the streets.</p>
<p>The neon lights still proudly flaunt themselves, and the bustling crowds still laugh as much as ever. -- I remember, I once melted my life into the torrent of happy people who forgot the years, but now, the crowds are still the same, and I stumble along to unearth the traces of history.</p>
<p>My life is still so short, these wounds are still so fresh, and an active heart hates loneliness so much. However, the devil chuckles in the dark corners, and I eventually chew on the bitter juices of the heart.</p>
<p>Forget bravely, I once thought.</p>
<p>But the first seeds sown are the hardest to pull out. What's more, the seeds have already sprouted, with beautiful flowers that make you nostalgic and appreciative, and with stinging thorns. If you want to pull them out, you must first pay the price.</p>
<p>Today, only today, can mankind dominate.</p>
<p>The time of the past is like clouds flying in the sky, water flowing in the river. What reason to find its tracks, time never flows back, past traces are always past traces, only adding a sense of loss, evoking some nameless sorrow.</p>
<p>A beautiful heart can create a beautiful world.</p>
<p>Thinking about the world that is reminiscent of old feelings and old scenes seems to be completely isolated from the new and beautiful reality.</p>
<p>Wandering the streets. Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow... —35, 7, 31</p>
<h3>Musical Musings</h3>
<p>— Hongyin</p>
<p>Music is the most unrealistic art. People who play music are often able to ignore the practical interests and "benefits" of reality, especially those who do music education. If everything starts from "benefits" and "successes and failures", I advise such people to do business or be politicians, not to do art!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood 2</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>There was also a time (not within the 38,900+ minor battles) that in S City in the occupied zone, an intelligence station was discovered by a traitor. One night, an agent was working when he was captured by the Japanese military police.</p>
<p>After many tortures, this brave fighter stood firm, without saying a word.</p>
<p>Finally, the Japanese military police made a small hole in his rib seam, put a surgical clamp into the hole, clamped out a piece of his lung, and cut it off. He immediately fainted. Hot blood gurgled out of the hole, soaking his shirt and pants. The ground was covered in a pool of blood. The Japanese military police used surgery to stop the bleeding and stitched up the seam. He woke up, saw the pool of blood on the ground, smiled coldly, and still didn't say a word.</p>
<p>Perhaps he thought that this pool of bright red blood was his glory, and that it was a symbol of the final victory.</p>
<p>In addition, there is an even more ordinary scene. Compared with the many tragic events in the War of Resistance, this is indeed an ordinary scene.</p>
<p>A small village that had just been invaded by the enemy was burned, killed, looted, and raped. As the enemy prepared to build fortifications, preparing to hold it for a long time, a small team of guerrillas rushed over to deal with this group of bandits.</p>
<p>The one who automatically served as a guide was an old farmer from the village. A wave of grief and indignation accumulated in his heart—the ancestral nine-room house was burned to the ground; his wife, daughter-in-law, and daughter were imprisoned by the bandits in the village chief's house, and their fates were unknown; his son was wounded by a bayonet and had to serve as a porter for the enemy.</p>
<p>He couldn't shoot a gun. He only held a carrying pole with pointed ends. Past midnight, he led the small team of guerrillas to attack. As soon as the gunfire started, the fire also broke out. The guerrillas carried out annihilation and pursuit in a methodical manner.</p>
<p>When the work was completed and the team returned, it was dawn, but the guide was nowhere to be seen. Asked the old, young, and female villagers who remained, but no one knew. After searching for a long time, they found him lying at the base of the courtyard wall of the village chief's house, his eyes not closed, his teeth still clenched, and yet there seemed to be a hint of a smile. His only weapon, the carrying pole, also lay beside him, with some blood stains on the pointed ends. But there were two large wounds on his legs and chest; blood was still flowing continuously, seeping from his body into the soil.</p>
<p>In the twenty-two major battles, one thousand one hundred and seventeen important battles, and thirty-eight thousand nine hundred and thirty-one minor battles, there are many tragic stories of bloodshed. In addition to these major battles, important battles, and minor battles, there were also those heroic guerrillas, those death-defying special forces fighting with the enemy, and countless selfless and nameless heroes who performed countless tragic stories of bloodshed.</p>
<p>Although the atomic bomb shortened the war by a year and a half, if you knew how depleted the Japanese national power had become, how strong the morale of our Chinese soldiers had become, and how fully and completely prepared the total counterattack of our country and the Allied nations was, perhaps you would rather that those atomic bombs be born a year and a half later.</p>
<p>"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." Although the ancient dogmatic retaliation is harmful to the harmony of nature, I believe that it is still easier to settle this huge blood debt with the enemy, clearly and precisely. It has been almost a year since the victory, and under the scrutiny of the public, they have completely evaded it. If things go wrong, they may even bite us back, as if to say that we are such an incompetent country that we still remain a major stumbling block to world civilization and progress unless we are controlled by foreign powers.</p>
<p>Martyred national heroes! I hope that this pen can redraw a clear outline of all the bloody stains since the War of Resistance…!</p>

<h3>Congratulations</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council was officially established yesterday. We are delighted by the establishment of this organ of public opinion, which will lay the foundation for true democracy, step onto the stage of constitutional implementation, and seek welfare for our 4.5 million citizens. We would also like to congratulate our representatives on their health.</p>
<p>Those who study the history of parliaments often praise the British Parliament. In fact, the spirit of Parliament is also very simple: everyone knows what they know, and says everything they can. In the parliamentary seat, you can be stern and serious, you can pound the table and scold, and you can mercilessly attack the other party until they are completely defeated, but there is one principle: loyalty to the country (despite differences in political views). Outside of Parliament, everyone is still good friends, and there is no slightest impact on personal friendships.</p>
<p>The situation in the US House of Representatives is similar.</p>
<p>It is precisely because there is such a watchful and unforgiving organ of public opinion that fully fulfills its responsibilities and supervises the government that British and American leaders have to be extra cautious in their administration. On the other hand, all measures are supported by a strong people.</p>
<p>In fact, very few British and American leaders are not from Parliament. Disraeli, the last Prime Minister of the Victorian Dynasty, fought in Parliament for more than thirty years.</p>
<p>In the past, people scolded others, and in the future, they will be scolded by others. Whether scolding or being scolded, one must cultivate a morality of scolding and a magnanimity of scolding. Progress can only be made in the midst of scolding.</p>
<p>Scolding people requires knowledge and cultivation. The Parliament does not tolerate malicious attacks and nagging. Those who are scolded must also have knowledge and cultivation, otherwise they will either be speechless and at a loss, or they will get angry and jump up and down.</p>
<p>Shanghai's natural status is important, and there are indeed too many problems. With this organ of public opinion, the opinions of our 4.5 million citizens can have a chance to be vented. We support the Municipal Council, and we also support our representatives to speak for us, complain, and even scold. The more tense and enthusiastic, the more we applaud, because we know that the effect of scolding is improvement. It is progress. And progress will bring us benefits.</p>
<h3>Who Will Go to the Moon?</h3>
<p>— Gui Ting</p>
<p>The first person to fly to the moon will probably be a woman around thirty years old.</p>
<p>She will fly to the moon on the tip of a super rocket. Her physique may be twice as tolerant of super-speed impact force as a man's. This is just a tentative prediction, because recently, experiments on rats, rabbits, and cats have found that females are always more physically tolerant than males. If women's physique is roughly the same as animals, then the above prediction should not be wrong.</p>
<p>Professor Britton and his assistants at the University of Virginia School of Medicine conducted this experiment by placing these animals in a special centrifuge and rotating them for two minutes at speeds up to 120 revolutions per minute. This speed is equal to 25 times the impact force of normal gravitational acceleration.</p>
<p>This experiment is to prepare for the near future when we can reach a speed of one thousand miles per hour and the direction of flight changes very quickly and drastically. Before the war, the effect of G-force on higher animals was never noticed. Later, the problem of G-force was discovered because of the study of the pain felt by dive bomber pilots when they suddenly flew upwards after diving. According to average reports, they can usually withstand about six G's of force, but may withstand a maximum of ten G's of force for the shortest time. This can be considered the maximum limit that humans can withstand.</p>
<p>Dr. Britton's experiment found that those animals were still able to survive after being subjected to 25 G's of centrifugal force for two minutes. Although there were no apparent injuries afterwards, they always died after several hours for some unknown reason. Dr. Britton pointed out that speed has no harmful effect on the physiology of animals. Living things on Earth are constantly moving at a speed of about 500,000 miles per hour. That number is based on the Earth's rotation speed, the solar system's movement, and the galaxy's rotation, but they themselves have no feeling whatsoever.</p>
<p>We only feel uncomfortable when the speed suddenly changes, such as when the elevator suddenly stops or when the car suddenly drives off. This is the result of the sudden change in the center of gravity affecting our body tissues and blood circulation.</p>
<p>The experiment also found that fully mature animals were more tolerant of the effects of centrifugal force than younger ones, and females were much stronger than males.</p>
<p>They rotated thirty-six male rats at a speed of 120 revolutions per minute, or 25 G's of force, for two minutes, and they died within a few minutes after stopping. Twenty-four female rats were subjected to the same experiment, and only two died. The center of gravity of the female animal's body seems to be different from that of the male, but the amount of displacement may be comparable.</p>
<p>According to speculation, humans may be more tolerant of this type of experiment than lower animals, because they have been walking upright for millions of years and have long been accustomed to adapting to the displacement of body weight. At the same time, we also believe that women are physically superior to men, just like female cats are to male cats. This may foreshadow that in the next war, most of the drivers will be women.</p>
<p>Dr. Britton and his assistants also discovered that animals can gradually adapt to high G-forces over a considerable period of time. At first, eighteen pairs of rats were rotated at a slight speed, and then the speed was gradually increased every day. When it was increased to 25 G's of force, half of them were still able to survive, otherwise almost all of them would die.</p>
<p>Their hearts were apparently affected by the centrifugal force, causing them to eject more blood to all the organs of the body. At first, the heart rate gradually increased, but later slowed down due to fatigue. The breathing rate also gradually increased. The strangest thing is that the brain waves of the animals also underwent significant changes during the rotation experiment.</p>
<p>The animals were killed one by one after the experiment and subjected to autopsy. Small parts of bleeding were found in the various organs of the body, but this damage was almost insignificant. However, the cause of death still could not be determined. It was probably due to the violent shock to the entire physiological system.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Britton's calculations, a person, especially a woman, may be able to withstand four to six G's of force for about ten minutes without dying. This experiment is very difficult to conduct. Because the person being tested will easily lose consciousness, once the experiment begins, there is no way to control any reaction to stop its progress. Even if it reaches a dangerous level, it cannot be controlled. Therefore, it is still in the animal testing stage.</p>
<p>However, it seems that the moon will mostly be destined to be a new realm under the rule of women in the future!</p>
<h3>Young People: Go to the Sky!</h3>
<p>— Zhang Rongzhi</p>
<p>The annual Air Force Day has arrived again! Recalling that time when the Chinese Air Force made a stunning debut, there is indeed unlimited inspiration!</p>
<p>The Japanese invaders thought that the Chinese Air Force was weak! and could be bullied! On August 14th, they sent the most elite Kisarazu and Kanoya air squadrons, with great fanfare; not at all tentatively, into the skies over Shanghai, preparing for a major trampling. Who knew! They were unlucky enough to run into my young Chinese Air Force, which, with a spirit of great fearlessness, annihilated these two most elite air squadrons of the enemy.</p>
<p>The Air Force today has become the main force in combat. The surrender of the Japanese invaders! Although due to two scientific atomic bombs, it was also because the Japanese invaders lost air supremacy.</p>
<p>Since the Air Force has become a condition for survival, commemorating Air Force Day should focus on building a strong Air Force!</p>
<p>Chairman said in "China's Destiny": "Everyone must aspire to be a pilot." Therefore, young people with ambition, quickly join the Air Force. Patriotic men, become flying generals!</p>
<p>Today, celebrating Air Force Day, the people of the country should have a deep understanding. So that China can build a majestic air force with the ability to attack and defend in the next few years!</p>
<p>At the same time, we should thank our international friends for their various assistance during the war! And General Chennault's "Hump" transport team and the famous Flying Tigers are even harder to forget! The Soviet volunteer air force shed blood for China in the early stages of the war of resistance! This is also deserving of gratitude! Finally, I would like to pay my respects to our Air Force martyrs!</p>
<p>Young people, go to the sky!</p>
<h3>The Death of Yan Haiwen, a Chinese Air Force Warrior</h3>
<p>— You Xuan</p>
<p>On August 14, the second day after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in the 26th year of the Republic of China, the Chinese Air Force, which had not been around for long, resolutely launched an attack to defend the motherland, posing a great threat to the enemy.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 17th, a Chinese bomber circled and soared over the Shanghai-Songjiang area, dropping bombs on the open formation. The enemy retaliated with intense anti-aircraft fire, causing the warplane to fall into countless exploding shells. Unfortunately, the tail of the plane was hit and it fell down, emitting smoke. The warriors in the plane had no choice but to parachute.</p>
<p>There was a commotion in the enemy's camp, and many enemy soldiers began to circle around the landing site. The young air force warrior held a pistol in his hand and stood fearlessly on a high ground.</p>
<p>The encirclement was shrinking, and an enemy soldier wanted to approach and force him to surrender. With a "snap," he answered the enemy's insulting gesture with a bullet. At this time, the enemy had no choice but to temporarily disperse, and then used greater and more forces and weapons to rush up.</p>
<p>The encirclement was further shrinking, and the two sides were only fifty meters apart. The warrior resisted alone, with only one bullet left. He looked around, and all around were enemies. So he looked at the sky, smiled, and then stood at attention on the motherland's battlefield, raised his gun, and committed suicide for his country.</p>
<p>He was Yan Haiwen, an air force martyr, who wrote an indelible page in the history of the Chinese Air Force.</p>
<p>An American sailor, Hall, only eighteen years old, married a woman of thirty-eight. The picture shows the couple's honeymoon passion.</p>
<h3>Key Money and Tips Exist in Name Only</h3>
<p>— Zhong Xian</p>
<p>According to reports, the Municipal Council passed the regulations on the management of house rentals, stipulating that the Shanghai Municipal House Rental Management Committee may inspect vacant houses, and those suitable for living may be rented out within a limited time, and there are also regulations on collecting rent: In addition to collecting rent, the lessor shall not collect key money and tips in any name. This news can be said to be good news for those who have no house to live in, but in order to achieve the purpose of this house rental rule and solve the housing shortage, I believe that it still needs the assistance of all parties and the careful work of the management committee.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the current housing shortage in Shanghai is not without human causes. In fact, there is not a shortage of houses. What is lacking are connections. Just open the classified advertisements in the daily newspapers, and there are many houses vacant in the rental and key money sections. If you don't believe me, look at the advertisement wording, such as "surplus houses for rent" and "vacant houses for key money." Think about it, aren't surplus houses and vacant houses houses that no one lives in? As for the types of houses, you can have whatever you want, such as garden houses, apartments, Shikumen entire, three-story buildings, entire floors, side rooms, pavilions, parlors, etc. In short, there are houses, as long as you have the intention and the power. So I think to inspect vacant houses suitable for living, just take the classified advertisements in the newspaper and go to the address!</p>
<p>Let's talk about the regulations on collecting rent! It is also clearly published in the rental and key money advertisements in the newspaper. Now I will copy a few recent advertisements from the newspaper word for word, without avoiding the suspicion of doing free advertising: "2 million (storefront) with business equipment for rent, monthly rent 100,000, ×× Road × Alley × Number" "×× Road ×× Road double-room one-story house, new paint, move-in fee 28 bars" "Cheap, urgent transfer of 2.5 million exquisite vacant room, one, ×× Road ×× Alley ×× Villa ×× Number." Smart people should understand what the price in the above advertisements is. So I think to find out whether key money and tips are being collected, just look at these facts!</p>
<p>Finally, I have to state: I am not doing it as an informant to get 30% of the bonus. I am just trying to assist the House Rental Management Committee and offer a few opinions.</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of a Taoist Ritual</h3>
<p>— Mao Zihou</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many articles in the newspapers criticizing Taoist rituals. Taking a comprehensive view, they all say: "Taoist rituals drive away ghosts, waste money and manpower. Some Shanghai people are too backward in their thinking..." and suggest methods such as "introspection" and "not donating money" as good ways to eliminate "Taoist rituals." No one has thought about analyzing this issue and proposing a good way to eliminate this unreasonable phenomenon!</p>
<p>Originally, most people who oppose "Taoist rituals" believe that the motivation for holding Taoist rituals is due to the "superstition" of some citizens. Therefore, they all put forward negative calls, but no positive suggestions. In today's Shanghai, are Taoist rituals to drive away ghosts really due to the superstition of some citizens? The author can say responsibly: "No"! That is caused by a small number of local ruffians taking the opportunity to make money. Just use power to arrest the organizers of the Taoist ritual one by one and charge them with "fraud." You will definitely be able to achieve the goal of no one following up. If it is a matter of religious faith, people will inevitably follow one after another, sacrificing themselves to this "superstition." Facts will soon automatically prove whether "Taoist rituals" are really "superstition" or "profiteering."</p>
<p>Citizens who are slightly familiar with the inside story of Shanghai society must know that there are many "mountain-sitting" hooligans in Shanghai who collude with gatekeepers to make a Taoist ritual business in July every year, which can earn half a year's worth of expenses. This is an absolutely true fact. Those who handle the business appear in the form of "doing public welfare," supplemented by the evil power of "local snakes," collecting donations from house to house, forcing you to refuse. The fact that the accounts are not audited is the key to the collusion of the "Taoist ritual" leaders. Under the promotion of the clamoring of ignorant women, the psychological desire for blessings of the elderly, and the fear of trouble of ordinary people, few people dare to come forward to publicize and prevent Taoist rituals, which is why they are held every year without interruption.</p>
<p>From a legal point of view, "donation" is a kind of "gift." If it is not attached with conditions, the donor has no right to interfere with the disposal of the gift. However, this kind of "gift," if it is issued with forced requirements (for example, assigning quotas and designating the amount of donations), is tantamount to extortion. In an extortion setting, using deceitful means to take possession of a portion of the object of the extortion - money - is in accordance with the fraud provisions of the criminal law.</p>
<p>Therefore, I call on society: do not be superstitious about "Taoist rituals." Donate the money to "emergency hospitals." Some so-called: "scratching an itch through a boot." Because most of the citizens who pay for Taoist rituals are unwilling to do so. Therefore, the reason why they must pay money to donate to Taoist rituals to drive away ghosts is that they are forced by "evil forces"!</p>
<p>The most active way should be to call on the municipal government: Please use your power to resolutely eliminate the strange phenomenon of holding peace rituals in July! Do not let foreigners photograph the strange appearance of "Taoist rituals" and send them to overseas newspapers for publication, saying: "This is the most common good method used by Shanghai citizens in the 'epidemic prevention' of 1946." Fortunately! (Move the payment to help doctors who died from the epidemic)</p>
