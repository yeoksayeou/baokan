<h3>蘇軍今日撤離城區　長春命運卽可決定　北上國軍揎近四平街</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕東北近况異常緊張，長春已臨暴風雨前夕，梁華盛刻在昌圖指揮部隊，排出阻礙推進中。杜聿明病已大愈，準備於十七日出關，親自指揮軍事。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕東北軍政中心之錦州，前晚一度虛驚，據悉在錦州二華里區域曾發現中共軍便衣隊，但不久即被國軍驅散。綏中附近情勢亦頗緊張，該城西北之明水塘門，共軍正集結兵力圖襲綏中。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十三日電〕蘇軍廿四小時後將完全撤離長春，新任防守司令陳家珍，已與即將卸除城防責任之卡洛夫少將約定，於十四日晨九時半作首次亦即最後一次晤談，屆時卡洛夫或將對城防問題有所交代，是否將舉行一簡單儀式，尙未決定。又第十四地區空軍司令昨由瀋飛返此，竟日視察蘇軍退出後之兩處機塲，其一爲偽滿時代之日本軍用機塲，設備已蕩然無存，房舍亦破爛不堪，惟滑行道尙可用。叧一爲民航機塲，亦即現所使用者，塲內大體完好，僅房舍中之傢具被搬運一空，該塲經我接收後，已三次有我機降落。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十二日電〕共軍今午攻佔長春西北郊宋家窪子，該地距市中心區的六七公里，並無保安隊駐紥，僅有少數民間武力，戰爭發生後，全市保安隊均已奉命進入陣地，各校提前下課，若干街道業已斷絕通行。蘇城防司令卡洛夫少將，曾派其副司令訪陳家珍，商談恢復秩序辦法，陳已令其部屬嚴守陣地，蘇坦克車同時前往彈壓，因蘇軍現仍負有城防之責也。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十三日電〕軍事觀察家就東北局勢發表意見稱：東北方面至少有四個地段在進行激戰中，長春命運將於未來廿四小時中決定。目下新一軍被阻於四平街之南，長春幾爲共產軍所包國，苟無奇蹟發生，則國軍勢難於十四日最後一批蘇軍撤退時進入長春。最近消息顯示新一軍某部已抄過共產軍在四平街一帶之砲兵陣綫，出現於通往公主嶺公路上之二石岔子（譯昔），觀察家認爲國軍雖奇襲成功，但恐仍不能挽回長春局勢，因該城外圍尙有共產軍之防錢甚多。</p>

<h3>熊式輝在瀋談話　蘇軍撤退期我無意修改　拆兵工廠設備有協定說純係捏造</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十三日電〕近來關於蘇軍自東北撤退事，外問謠傳甚多，記者爲明瞭眞象，特晋謁東北行營主任熊式輝，當承答覆如次：　間，據聞馬林諾夫斯基元帥近曾廣播云，中國方面對蘇軍於四月底以前完全撤出東北一節要求延緩，熊主任有所聞否？</p>

<h3>馬歇爾離美飛渝　國共雙方有恢復談判可能</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日電〕馬歇元帥十二日晚十時（東方時間）乘機飛渝，同機者有馬帥私人隨員數人。</p>
<p>〔合衆計重慶十三日電〕過去數星期間國共關係緊張，頗裂可能，但目下情形，已見改善，衆信此與馬歇爾將軍即將來華一點，大有關係。此間觀察家相信在馬爾返美期間，雙方相互竭力攻擊，以謀增強各自之地位。國共兩黨在三人小組中對於東北問題之各不相讓，並非由於吉倫將軍指導談判之無能，而由於雙方均欲爭取最大讓步之故。今日所傅國共願意妥協之消息，乃馬歇爾將軍返華後恢復談關之好現象。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十三日電〕美國特使馬歇爾刻正取道返華一項消息，似予陪都之政治活動以新的激動。國共雙方領袖之人長舉行會議，顯欲結束幾乎在馬使返華盛頓之當時即已存在之僵局。先爲政治協商會議綜合小組之會議，企圖完成憲法草案，以便於下月向南京國民大會中提出。次爲在民主同盟領導下之各黨領袖會議，籲請中共與國民黨執政者，就軍政歧異各點，迅速成立妥協。現無具體理由相信，在馬使離華期間惡化臻於危險階段之內部危機，有任何接近解決之希望。但此間現有一派樂觀氣象，則又非常確實。今日主要之糾紛有二：第一，亦即最嚴重之東北收復問題，國共雙方眾隊正爲接收蘇軍撤退區域而發生衝突，第二，爲關於憲草中各爭點之解決。關於此事之協定，甚爲重要，因此舉可以减輕數十萬軍隊爲背景之柬北現行危險的緊張局勢。軍事三人小組（並馬使代表士倫在內）東北之行，或可澄清氛圍而准許馬使對於全國統一之艱難工作，重新開始。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十三日電〕民主同盟發言人今日談稱，東北領袖多人籲請國共領袖接受民主同盟調解之結果，東北問題極有妥協之可能。軍政部長陳誠已贊同一項提議，即共軍倘能制止其軍隊，准許政府軍收復長春及哈爾濱，則政府軍亦將限制東北接收範圍。</p>
<h3>浙省書長　內定雷法章</h3>
<p>並暫兼杭州市長</p>

<h3>日普選結果全部揭曉　保守黨派擭勝利　自由進步兩黨領袖表示　不擬立即要求現閣辭職</h3>
<p>〔本報東京特派員十三日專電日本政府尚未發表此次大選之最後結果，但本所記者已自權威方面控悉確實之消息：自由黨獲一三九席（包括婦女五席），亓步黨九十一席（內婦女六席），社會民主黨九十三席（內婦女八席），共產黨五席（內婦女一席），協同黨十六席（婦女無獲選者），小黨派三十八席（內婦女八席），無黨派八十四席（內婦女十席），總數四百六十六席。</p>
<p>又自由黨定十五日召開總務會，十八日召開當選議員齊，以決定今後應取方針。〔本報束京十三日專電〕此次大選中，個人票數最多者，為社會民主黨黨員加薩隆夫，及所謂「日本議會之父」尾崎行雄。</p>
<p>〔合眾社東京十三日電〕日本普選結果，將於十七日管制日本委員會開會前潑表，麥帥刻正準備將選形情形作一分析。渠對於日本婦女三十八人被選入議會一節，尤感欣慰。</p>
<p>〔改造日報東京十三日電〕本木今次普選結果，自由黨雖獲第一黨地位，然未能佔絕對多數議席，進步。社會兩黨亦勢均力敵，普選後日本政局之動向，因此頗有趨於複雜之傾向。內閣秘書長猶橋今日表示，現因閣因負修正憲法之重要使命，故無實行辦職幟之必要，乃望竭力繼續維持至特別議會閉幕為止。按自由黨總裁鳩山昨已表示不立即要求幣原內閣總辭職，進步黨領袖齋藤亦謂暫不採取推辭現內閣之積極態度，目前日本決不能由一黨一派打開難局，故贊成由各黨組織聯合內閣。現內閣倘欲繼續維持，以完成制憲使命，則須徵求各黨諒解。</p>
<h3>日五大黨　政治綱領</h3>
<p>〔本報十三日東京專電〕「朝日新開」發表日本五大政黨（社會民主黨，共產黨。自由黨。進步黨與合作黨）之政治綱領。除共黨以外，其他四政黨均將天皇制度保留于其綱領之內。關于糧食問題，共黨主張人民管理糧食與配給，並建議揭發私藏貨物，但自由黨之政策，則反對搜索富人藏糧，僅建議抬高米價，在農民納糧之後，應准于市場上之自由買賣。關于通貨膨脹，自由黨主張中止發行新公售，但共黨則認為所有小銀行應合併為一大銀行，山人民管理。至于進步與協同黨之大綱，除一二點之外，其餘均與自由黨雷同。社會民主黨主張保留天皇制從，與三個右翼黨之意見相符，而異于共黨，但在通貨膨脹汝糧食問題方面，則與共黨主張相符。在舉行火選前，本報記者曾與各層階級人物談話，發現智識份子傾向社會民主黨，工人與學生最授等擁護共產黨，但勝利將　　自由黨興達步黨，因日農民仍有奉日皇為神聖，並以為自由與進步兩黨猶係代表日本政府也。</p>
<h3>蘇將要求援用憲章　對付弗朗哥政權　西國指波蘭政有為隗儡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十三日廣播：西班牙大使館發言人令日聲稱：安全理事會若邀請西班牙出席聽取波蘭對弗朗哥政府所提出之控訴，西班牙決予拒絕。據謂：華沙現行政府乃一傀儡政權，任從紅軍佔領其土地。該發言人並否認德科學家曾利用西班牙金騐原子炸彈。</p>
<p>〔中夫社紐約十二日合眾電〕本晚悉聯合國安全理事會下週討論波籣所提西班牙弗朗哥政權威脅世界和平一案時，蘇聯將要求安全理事會援用聯合國憲章，以對付西班牙現政種。據倫敦方面收得莫斯科廣播謂：蘇認為此係援用聯合國憲章，由世界各國聯合採取對付西班牙政權之時機，此項廣播乃蘇答復英美所認為　前情勢，應由西班牙人民自行決定之立塲。莫斯科廣播稱：「弗朗哥法西斯政權，顯屬不能認為純係西國內事件」。倫敦來訊認為此項廣播，乃代表蘇官方意見者。英可能提議，由英美法三國，合商討論設法反對安會理事會對弗朗哥採取行動。英設或採取此－方針，則英美兩國一方面同意安會理事會於下週會議中，討論西國情勢。另方面可能設法使安全理事會延期採取行動。美國務院發言人謂：渠不知有舉行三强會議建議之事。</p>
<h3>外長會議舉行期近　重要問題待解次　歐洲戰後發展己屆成敗關頭　全視各國能否擬定方案而定</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕歐洲人士現皆以特別焦灼之情緒，迎候將於廿五日在巴黎舉行之英美法蘇四國外長會議，蓋歐洲戰後之發展，今已至成敗關頭，全視各大國將否擬定和平解決方案而定。歐洲各國現皆期望四國外長會議之答覆，將否使歐洲從事安定之復興工作，抑將任其政治，經濟，社會長此混亂下去，深望各大國能即闡明歐洲之和平機構，但鑒於倫敦外長會議之失敗，未能成立對歐洲任何一國和平條約之協議，今欲巴黎外長會議，即能對歐洲和平有所成就，殆屬一種奢望云。</p>

<h3>工業複員與勞資合作</h3>
<p>— 尹致中</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，國家所要調整的，真是千頭萬緒；就中以促進經濟建設，尤關重要。中國經過八年抗戰，形成了生產停頓，物用匱乏，民生凋弊的現象。全國為失業失養的低氣壓所籠單，幾乎透不過氣來。對症下華的辦法，必須做到生產恢復，日用給足，民生安定的幾個條件，然後失業的始有業，失養的始有養。要做到這幾種條件，工業界的急遽復員，當然是推動此種性能的契機。我們有廣大的勞働羣眾，就應該利用他的潛在力，利物質配合起來，打成一片，以復興我們的經濟，發展我們的民族資本；使人盡其力，地畫其材，物盡其用，則國家方可富盛，民生方得昭蘇。</p>
<p>在戰前，我國於輕工業方面，因為工資的低廉，勞資間的協調，所以尚能有相當的收穫。此時日本國力強盛，生產力高昻，我國還不免相形見紬。現在德國是戰敗了，日本是降伏了，一般見解，以為中國的工業此可在國內外市場上作部份的取代，或多量的補給。此在表面上看來，的確並非空想。個然能將這個或會把握作，中國的民族資本的碗可以抬頭了，但試一　　此時的現狀，則大謬不然。我們不但不能比戰前好，而且其　國的潛伏比戰前還要深刻化。這決不是危言聳聽，事事也量在面前。</p>
<p>現在使工　復員受到打擊的。不外是一，交通阻梗，二。埠　　　，三。工潮澎　等等；但概括的說，是政治的不安定，為言敗　的不安，交通便不能通暢，原料更無從補給，工潮要不　　　　　以工　復員，昨聲雖甚　感上，還是無從復原。交述的阻礙，國外的影響還小，國內的影響却大。因為國外的交通，到相當時期，就可以恢復，而國內則政治如不走上光明的路道，其時間的延長，是不能預料的。原料自然跟着交通有關係，因為物價的不斷踊騰，工人失業的愈多，有工作的工。資收入亦無從與高物價相追踪；所以工人的要求生活待遇的增高，個人認為是很合理的，不過我認為勞資要真誠的合作，不可攙雜絲毫的意氣或政治作用。國國經濟的恢復，勞力與資方占着同等的重要。工資提到相當的標準，資方理應坦白接受，而勞方亦應與資方盡力生產，能這樣互相同情，互相諒解，方能使工業逐漸復員，逐漸繁榮。若不能循這個途徑去進門，一定要兩敗俱傷，因為以後與我們鬥爭的，不是本國的勞和資，而是國內外市場上的與人競爭問題。</p>
<p>不要以為德日毀收，中國可以高枕無憂的去發展我們的工業推廣我們的市場了。勞資間的諒解和合作不能改善，恐怕不但不能把市場擴大，而且還要愈加縮小。璧如日本降伏後，南洋的市場，我們一定有機會取而代之的，所以能取而代之的理由，是日本正在時代政治影響法則的陶鎔演化中，一時不許他有復原的機會；而我國則正趁着這個機會去加緊復員，加緊生產。在復員以後，速得加倍，不，加十倍而倍的努力，以增加生產，然後可以把我們的生產品，去代替日本的生產品。「時不我與」，這機會是稍縱即逝的。而我們今日尚不能把原有的地位恢復起來，遑論其他。同時日本已在麥克沃塞將軍的預諾下，可以其各種輕工業的自由發展，准許日本人從生產上得到較佳生活的願望。如果拿美國人給予的原料，和刻苦耐勞，絕處逢生的日本人的勞慟力所配合的力量，出而角逐，我恐中國工業的命運是未可樂觀的。那末，現在與此後的南洋市塲，及其他國外市塲，中國還能希望擴展麼？還能保持原來的地位麼？再回過頭來看，國家如無特別的獎勵或保護政策，日本及其他國家的貨品，還可侵佔我國內的市場的，那末，我們勝利後所抱的甜美之夢，豈不要落個一塲空麼？</p>
<p>復員，復員，復員先為着我工業界已經離了本位而說的。—當然大部份為被迫而然的—復員是要使從事於工業界之勞和資，各歸本位。資方不能把資本再游離在投機，囤積，高科貸等等的不正常經營中，趕快守他的本位去生產；這是資方的復員。勞方不能只聽高調和追求理論，在可能按受的條件下，趕快歸他的本位去戮力生產；這是勞方的復員。雙方復員後互相合作，互相提携，以達到各自的滿足。需知小我之外有大我，們人之外有國家，勞資問相忍為國，資方使勞方能維持他合理的生活，勞方使資方能得到相當的利潤。萬不能各走極端，互用手段。勞方的發動罷工，是於萬不得巳時用之，若一加濫用，即失其同情與效力，因為資方眞到無路可走時，只有放棄他的生產事業，這種情形在各地巳數見不鮮。資方如無故以停廠來威脅勞方是不許可的；但眞到支持無力，呼籲無門的時侯，亦惟有走此一着。這是絕路，是雙方的絕路！我們萬不能有此種現象發生。如果欲防止此種不幸現象，惟有互相同情，互相諒解，互相忍耐。</p>
<p>機會是稍縱即逝的，我們的勞與資如果從今天起眞能誠意的合作起來，我相信縱使有外來的競爭，前途仍是光明的。無限的人力，不盡的原料，深厚的國際友情，都是我們工業界的基礎，只是再不能游移徘徊，因循坐誤了。以後怎樣的「宏規偉劃」，且不必去侈談；勞方與資方趕快要復員，要眞誠的携手合作，各在本位上去努力。</p>

<h3>逆產昨起移交　处理局最行點收　吳凱聲等五戶　預計全部移交兩月始完畢業　逆產組　負責人談　處置困難種種</h3>
<p>某軍事機關奉令査封之大批漢奸財產，已於昨日起開始移交敵僞產業處理局逆產組，點收接管。按該軍事機關在滬逮捕之漢奸三百餘人，已於最近分批移解法院。此三百餘漢奸被査封之逆產，每戶列成一淸册，昨已有一部份淸册送交處理局。昨日逆產組即按照淸册開始點收。聞昨已點收者，有僞駐義大使吳迎凱聲及劉逆偉俊等五巨奸之逆產。於移交點收時，並由行政院派童專門委員爲代表，到塲監交。逆產組於接收該項逆產後，則即依照敵僞產業處理局之規程，分別交由中央銀行·中央信託局·江海關接管。全部逆產預定於兩月內可點收完畢。</p>
<p>保管頗多困難</p>
<p>據逆產組負責人語記者，逆產之處置，其情形不若敵產簡單，必須待法院將漢奸罪名判決後，始能根據判決而處置其所有之逆產。故此項逆產，將暫時予以保管。而處理局最感棘手者，亦即爲此項逆產之如何處置。尤其如某漢奸被處死刑，於宣判主文中必謂「全部財產除酌留家屬必須生活費外沒收；」生活費作何標準，究竟酌留多少，法令並無規定。又如徒刑五年或十年，則其財產是否亦全部沒收，抑或部份沒收，是否隨罪刑之輕重而增减其財產之沒收量。凡此在法令上，亦皆無明文規定。故木組正謀與法院方面取得密切聯繫，並徵詢司法當局對此問題之意見；一面並擬向行政院請示確定辦法。此外，另一困難問題，爲接管後保管問題，目前該項逆產一部份，由某軍事機關派兵看管，但移交後，軍方所派士兵必將撤回，處理局即須調出大批人員前往接替看管。</p>
<p>慎防發生弊寶</p>
<p>叧有一部份漢奸房屋，仍由其家屬住居在內，所有屋內財產，亦即責令彼等保管。今後是否仍交由漢奸家屬保管，抑另委托保管人，及對該項房屋如何處理等等，現正在硏究中。並擬於日內邀謂各有關機關商討，決定一妥善之保管辦法。該負責人又稱，關於逆產中之金銀珠寳古董，逆產組將聘請專家鑒別其眞僞成色價値，製成封套，將鑽石珍珠袋入封內，而於封外標明種類佔價價格，再併納於一封套內，每戶一封，書明所有者之漢奸姓名；封套之兩端，由負責移交點收之主管者加蓋火漆章，送交中央信託局保管，以杜絕流弊云。</p>

<h3>紅舞女電巨騙　膽敢假冒錢市親戚大弄玄虛　假隨員假保鑣假裝闊綽　陳莉莉竟然落圈套</h3>

<h3>對政院分配房屋辦法　奚玉書表示盡允洽</h3>
<p>行政院爲解除公務人員居住困難，特規定分配上海各機關房屋辦法七項，記者昨訪晤自由協會常務理事奚玉書氏，談及新定分配房屋辦法。據奚氏表示，該項分配辦法，按諸本市實情，未盡允洽。敵僑居住房屋，屬於敵僞所有者，旣令一律接收出售，其非敵僞所有者，則令統一出租，似欠公允。蓋敵僞盤踞期內，市民房屋强被侵佔，受害已深，今敵人投降，已逾半載，敵僞遺留之民房，爲數不少，其中多由業主收回自住或租賃訂有契約的，屋內修理改裝，在所不免，耗費已多。今遲遲始訂新辦法，强令遷議，使人民重蒙損害。且雙方訂定之契約，亦因以失效，房主房客間糾紛之處理，將治絲益棼。本人認爲復員到滬人員，需要住房，自應設法解決，惟盼當局應就敵僞房屋申，儘先作公平合理之分配，如尙不敷，可再洽商經租房屋地產公司，撥出一部份住房，以分租公務人員。如强制執行，一面將侵奪人民居住之自由，一面加重被敵僞蹂躪已久之民間苦痛。政府措施，當以便利人民爲主，更宜兼顧事實，使一切法令推行盡利，希望行政院對此房屋分配辦法，重加考慮云。</p>

<h3>高等法院昨審漢奸案三起　已胡白龍山人之子　王叔賢保出未到庭</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高院昨日下午開調査庭一起，合議庭兩起，審理被訴漢奸案，各情分誌如下：</p>
<p>王叔賢　五十四歲，吳興人。係已故名書畫家白龍山人王一亭之子。近被高檢處提起公訴。起訴意旨略稱：被吿於民國卅四年三月，充任僞政府建設部與敵東亞海運株式會社合辦之中華輪船公司常務董事，兼船舶一部長。與另一被吿兪建民（四十六歲，鎭海人，）勾結開設新中國造船廠，代敵承修該公司僞「天盛丸」。並以修理費無款償付爲詞，於抗戰勝利後，領取鐵料三十－噸半，藏匿南市。經蓬萊路警察分局査獲，轉解本處，經偵查終結，認爲觸犯懲治漢奸條例，特提起公訴。該案由高院受理後，昨由劉毓桂庭長親自審訊。王叔賢特准交保在外，昨日缺席。據被吿律師稱，被吿因事前往湖州，不及趕回，叧一在押之被吿兪建民供稱：中華輪船公司爲一商營機構，而新中國造船廠則並無王叔賢之股份在內。承修「天盛丸」事，後因中華輪船公司無錢償賬，故以鐵條鐵板等共三十一噸半作似抵押。至稱「天盛丸」爲用以代敵裝載軍用品，全無此事。該船爲一小型木壳船，現由招商局改名爲江鴻輪，可請庭上行文向該局查詢云。並延費席珍·周永泉·等律師辯護，庭諭該案改日再訊。</p>
<p>施與文　駱廷章·高慶餘·邢適民·四人前充僞警局華山路分局警士。於卅三年二月十八日夜晚，向遝貨行大西路憶定盤路之朱德保敲詐一案，由當時僞法院扣押判刑在執行中。現由高檢處重行偵査，依漢奸罪提起公訴。昨開辯論庭，被吿由庭上指定之周永泉律師務義答辯。</p>
<p>黃文龍　二十四歲，上海人。前聶中丞華童公學畢業。近被徐建元檢舉，稱黃曾任僞江蘇海門縣政府外事科科員，並仗勢侵占木柴四百五十担。由高檢處提起公訴，昨日開庭時，被吿對所控各節，均加否認。並延顧文光律師辯護。庭諭以上兩案辯論終結，定於二十日下午二時半宣判。</p>
<p>由日引渡歸國　僞官移解軍部</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕現羈押于淞滬警備總司令部之僞滿駐日大使王允卿，僞府駐日使館參事王纘祖，秘書馮玉生·李雲禧·周福球·鍾一龍·程南遠·陳善耆·僞府駐神戶領事劉家瑜，副領事楊紹鴻，僞府駐日海軍武官王經武·陸軍武官袁汝南·等十六名漢奸，定今日解送南京陸軍總部。按上項人犯，係由東京盟軍總部海我方要求逮捕後，甫於九日派員專機引渡來滬者。初寄押於提籃橋警察分局，十二日始移送警備總部。</p>

<h3>銀根鬆動買戶雲集　金價逐漸盤上　美鈔亦穿出二千大關</h3>
<p>粭赤昨繼續　進，中行配售價仍為一六〇萬，此時因市價較低，無人登記，一說有四十條配給，下週一起，中行定金業登記請配，每條須預交證金五十萬元，以杜登記後退貨，十一時後，始越過配給價，形勢更挺，下週一之配售價頗為人所注意，金市之是否再起風浪，中行管制多時，又面臨嚴重關頭矣，最開平盤，開後一度圓挫，無如買戶利用鬆濫之銀根，繼續活動，脫股後之游資，紛有補進，時局關係，零星之買戶四處雲集，逐漸拉上，十時後尚在一五七萬左右盤旋，迨後美鈔越過二千大期，金市亦穿出一六大關，午刻在一六三萬前後，午後某種壓力加重，二時後重又破入一六大關，最後尚穩，結榮較前收漲五萬五，飾金十七萬四，紋銀一千五，銀元一千零五，暗息銀根更濫，息價自一角二至一角六。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔在半投機半實銷之情况下，買風一再發動，投機家運用其豐厚之實力，加之商輪大批入口，不合格之結款，勢必借車現鈔抵價，過程堅俏非常，美匯掛牌雖未更動，但大勢趨榮，劉此有伸縮性之管理，咸有看高之希冀，晨開一九七〇元，一度在一九五〇元左右掙扎，入後金市上漲，美鈔買戶遂源源不斷，彼此呼　，十一時後穿出二千元大關，午刻已站定在美匯掛牌之上，午後電市回挫，漲勢遭阻，結果較前收升七十元，港票新老平價，結果老貨好五元，新貨漲十元，美匯銀行對做價二千元，買價稍升至一九六〇元，港電羅比平穩。</p>
<p>外匯放長　純係謠言</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕逝二日來金　　市投機家又電隙而動，外匯放長之消息時有所傳，致二日來金價匯價趨勢又堅，記者特以此事詢諸關係方面。據悉：外傳外匯頭寸之供給有限制之說，絕無其事。外匯放長亦純係投機家造謠，以圖投機利得，金市昨日最高峯曾即一百六十二萬，中央銀行見情，即自動委託金號拋售小量黃金市况即趨平穩。</p>
<h3>新茶上市聲中　茶商行號紛起　籌劃發展對外貿易</h3>
<p>各地新茶相繼登場，同業積極籌劃發展外洋貿易，新設立之行號，有若雨後春笋，至於新貨龍井，茲據溫杭兩產區消息，邇日客方仍在裝運，大致於日內恐有躉批蒞臨，陳貨花色，吐納活動乃少，情况亦疲憊如故云。</p>
<h3>米價堅挺　雜糧油餅均漲</h3>
<p>昨日米市到銷兩平，版運客商無利可圖，售性甚堅，梗米回升三五百元，白元來去兩種，依然暫平陰元到不敵銷，價續升千元，麵粉潮州去化活潑，再見飛騰八九百元，　皮步步盤升，續加自元，豆耕早堅午後，黃豆高貨因汕頭略取，價漲千元，中下本街動而不旺，價升三五百元，生仁零化甚殷，再漲一一千元，汕市情盤見緊，午時轉懈略加五六白元至干元，棉餅亦升一二百元</p>
<p>又訊，據米市場息，昨日本市計到白粳等七種，共六千餘石，其種類如下：白梗三〇六八石，薄稍一一六五石，早稱一〇二五石，羊　三九〇石，杜秈五三一石，白元七七石，陰元一四六石</p>
<h3>白桐油續到　柏油形勢疲弱</h3>
<p>白桐油外銷依然若即若離，蓋近日漢桐繼續有到，本可暢通，囚外匯不能合算，故銷塲仍有阻礙，昨據漢電，已跌至五萬四千元，合申市須六萬二三千元。　美電現油為三角八分又八分，三，照現市匯例，似可稍通，但匯水能否站定，則未可知也，故此後對外貿易能否暢通，須視誰率而定，至於內銷本可發動，因天雨過久，於是延遲，各家售盤已稍廉，大概在六萬七八千元至七萬元之間，且桐源源有到，而浙桐價昂，均無人間津矣。</p>
<p>柏汕自久雨初晴後，本可銷路見旺，但如製　銷場依然沉寂，皂銷亦未若預計之熱鬧，探其原因，總以各物均趨下滿，大眾心理不免望廉殷切，以致去路未能見暢，各行家本售過五萬五千元，司馬秤送廠交卸，現各廠望廉，而售者則欲維原價，兩兩相持，致交易停頓，但市面確屬疲弱，近日行家售開禾本六萬元，內坪油五萬元，的干油四萬六千元，蘭油四萬二千元，麻城油三萬八千元。</p>
<h3>燒堿到銷　馬尼刺不准出口說　漢口帮之進胃甚濃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上月山馬尼刺運到美國燒喊三千餘桶市價從六十萬元，猛瀉至二十萬元，尚無受主，綠工廠方面，對於製品銷路不旺，進胃薄弱之故，近聞卜內門洋行到月牌千餘桶，即將配售各工廠，但據華僑方面消息，馬尼刺對於燒堿，有不准出口之耗，後市仍有看漲之望，又漢口帮進胃甚濃，漢市價在八十萬元左右，美貨亦須六十萬元云，又悉福化林黃凡士林，漂白粉等，美國均有到貨云。</p>
<h3>公債華股漸形冷淡　游資又集中外股　香港股票市場成立</h3>
<p>公債形勢恍惚，多空互有了結，統丙晨開平穩，最低退至四二二〇元，又回升至四五〇〇元左右，午刻在四四〇〇元以下盤旋，大戶在待機中，結果較前收計丙丁小升，甲乙平而戊種微挫，華股初穩繼疲，多方盡最大努力，無如持有者移資外向，近午竟都見低價，晨初高價永紗五三三〇元，美亞四三五〇元，韋龍四四八元，中途雖多掙扎，俄大部游資傾向外股及金鈔，賣氣步盛，結果較前收永紗美亞景福三熱各拌半成光景，新光勤興則跌一成，較冷各股除榮豐成交價較高外，餘仍繼績小挫，午後逢週六期交停做，外股有華股方面游資逢熱歸來，華商銀行之實力派繼續吸收，本戶搜羅怡紗，已感滿足，英聯遂更吃香，外商手中供源奇涸，在大眾垂青之下，外股更謠傳猶太商在港　組之股票市塲，已告成立之訊，倍形絢爛，怡紗上塲一度因隔夜浮多了結，小挫至一二〇〇〇元以下，但投機大戶放棄華股，將游資陸續搬來，終於節節步昂，午前怡紗英聯均見一四〇〇〇元高價，而後因獲利了結，轉形平穩，午收較前收怡紗英聯最熱，獨昂一成左右，餘均平穩而已，情况步華股後塵，操　一二熱門而已。</p>
<h3>紗市欲漲無力　現棉交易尚佳</h3>
<p>昨日紗市始漲終疲，晨初廿支雜牌喊高二三萬，然以買客稀少，支持不住，益以雙馬未漲，故即回落，人心已不若前日之振奮，蓋目下紗市欲漲無力，逢高即有廠家大量供售，一時殊不易高翔，收盤行市與上日比較，約好一萬元上下，獨雙馬反降一萬五千元。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉暴跌五十七至七十二磅音，計近期美金二七·三〇，遠期二七·三六，米特林現貨二七·八七，木埠現綿交易尚佳，申新二廠進太倉花四百包，同業互做，頗不寂寞，約有八九百包之譜，此外紡建與多數民營紗未有談判，市價受美棉暴跌刺激，勢略帶軟。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>食糖　各檔續見微跌，中砂白公會訓盛為四萬三千五百元，行售四萬四千元，號方開盤如上信蝕青已進五萬大關，為四萬八千元，刁青開門萬四千元，其他暗盤更遜。</p>
<p>針菜　　區存底已稀，據鎮江消息，反見上升，因此申市未能過廉，現行盤頂莊菜為十三萬萬千元，大興菜十二萬元，普通貨十一萬元。</p>
<p>棉布交易稀少，客帮亦清，川帮均感滬價高出川價，更因中紡開售尚多均在平疲中盤旋。</p>
<p>絲綢　麻絲廠隨金價趨升，洋莊進胃較佳，人絲售者眾多，價一致下　，綢市激漲，初聞金價猛升，空頭大起恐慌，急予補進，加以實銷活發，市價因之一致告漲。</p>
<p>香烟　英美烟因永泰和新配給之育島貨，現業已出貨，同業華機拋售，價一致下挫，老刀慘跌更烈，華商烟亦被帶下。</p>

<h3>旅行·　演講·　飽甞甜酸苦辣　邱吉爾在美國</h3>
<p>— 三月廿三日航訊　三報駐美特約記者朱家讓</p>
<p>英戰時首相邱吉爾，此次赴美休假，一共勾留二個多月，前天已經搭輪歸去了。邱氏現在雖然在野，但聲望依然甚健，特別當此世局紛紛，過去種種惟有他是最淸楚的經手人，所以當他一到美國，便自然吸住了萬千羣衆的注意。恰巧當時華盛頓參衆兩院的珍珠港案調査尙在進行，即有議員主張邀請邱氏親蒞作證，結果雖以礙於禮遇，沒有多數通過，但亦可見邱老仍是一位時代人物。何况他這回雖稱休假，實在還是很忙，疊訪華盛頓，與杜魯門懇談，發表演說八篇，接受名譽博士四起，把空氣轟得相富熱鬧。美國人對他的觀感，常然不免有譽有毀，但大致說來，還是多表好感的。</p>
<p>旅行陣容</p>
<p>邱吉邱氏在一月十四日坐伊利沙白皇后輪到紐約，旋即轉車赴美南避寒勝地邁阿密（Miami），實行休養。與他同來的有他的夫人女公子各一，秘書兩人，隨從一人，及警探兩名，連他一共八八，這可說是他旅行的陣容。他在美國邁阿密眞正休養的時間約佔三分之二，到三月初起，就開始旅行與活動，一直到動身回英爲止。現在不妨光來替他作偶簡括的起居注：</p>
<p>靜養階段</p>
<p>約自一月十五至三月二日，邱氏全在海邊囇太陽，看風景，游水以及練身體，大槪此老這幾年來，生活也够辛苦，再加英倫物資維艱，所以正好趁機到美修補。他吃下了不少木國所稀有的新鮮的鷄蛋與土產水菓，他又接受了人家餽贈的美好雪茄，以及頂佳妙的二十磅重肥鷄一尾。但據說邱老竟捨不得宰而食之。這可說邱氏疋式在休養的階段。</p>
<p>游歷階段</p>
<p>約自三月三日至十一日·邱吉爾與社魯門我次會晤·并又訪問貝爾納斯國務卿，陸軍部長柏德遜，參謀總長艾森豪威爾諸政要。他遊踪所至，計有哈瓦那（Havana），哥倫布（Columbus），福爾頓（Fulton），雷區蒙（Richnond），赫德公園（Hyed　Park），及阿爾巴尼（Albany）等，凡十餘埠，計程一萬英里之譜。接受四個名譽學位，各作演說一篇，不消說其中以社總統偕往在福爾頓威斯脫敏斯脫大學（Westminister）的一篇最爲重要。（邱氏另有四篇演說，一在當區蒙，三在紐的，其要旨想已見諸電訊，此間不　。）</p>
<p>紐約階段</p>
<p>自三月十一至十十日離美爲止，雖已近乎尾聲，却頂緊張。邱老行　將至，紐約市政府已經積極準備歡迎，一切程序盡皆妥切，尤其自邱氏福爾頓爆彈式的演說發佈以後，掀起普遍的迎拒風　，紐約五方雜處，警衛方面更須愼重，故那大邱氏一行乘車到達，本雪凡尼亞車站，即已警探密佈，沿車站至其旅邸，也成備森嚴。邱氏到紐翌日，即赴阿爾巴尼（紐的州政府所在地）拜會州長杜威，並到赫德公園他的老夥伴故羅斯福總統墓前獻花圈。此後，就問到紐的，開始接受紐市的歡迎程序了。</p>
<p>雨中紐約</p>
<p>紐約市政府對邱氏的招待，以三月十五日爲最高潮，那天剛巧下大雨，但邱氏仍依預定程序被迎游行市區，而紐約人也照舊興高米烈，爭仰手米。邱氏在警探火道戒衛中，身御雨衣，手持雪茄，站在敞車中備受歡呼，右手老是高舉示着Ｖ形，以爲答謝。這副優游　麗的風度，果眞另有一工。游行後，他赴市府，拜會市長，並接受名譽公民狀，接着便是入夜的一席大宴會，邱老又是一塲大演說，由全市電台一致地播送到全美每個角落去。</p>
<p>言論反應</p>
<p>邱氏這回在美言論，講明以在野之身，憑個人資格，所以說話確較自申·因此他對蘇聯盟友的態度，也可特別直率，結果引致了莫斯科的反攻，而在美國，同樣招惹了一部分的反感。在市府招待這天，總工會（CIO）所策動的羣衆一千說，爲示；反對市政府此舉，居然組起糾察隊，（此問工人慣常）用糾察隊（Pickets），以執行罷工及示威。）據守要衝，游行叫口號，並包圍邱氏旅邸。十八日此間哥倫比亞大學授予邱氏名譽法學博士，事前三小時，學生七百人，也臨時集會，聲言反對邱氏煽動戰爭。他們對邱氏主張英美結盟，（曾經否認）招引第三次大戰，竭力反對，於邱氏動輒以「英語民族」爲號召，也不贊同，因爲如此一來，反使世界分裂，而置蘇聯中國印度等等於何地。再則，儘有不少人事實不滿英帝國的作風，以致直截叫出二次大戰劍鉅痛深，我們不能再爲英帝國主義犧牲作戰。</p>
<p>學生口號</p>
<p>大會之后，一部學后也組起糾察隊，在學校大門側列陣「恭候」，男女不下二百餘，身上掛標語·　口中叫口號：「No　more　blood　,sweat　and　tears」，「Uno　peace，not　a　tory　war」不一而足，但因警察嚴密監視，並限定一個小範圍兜圈子，他們的呼喊，顯不爲邱老所聞及。邱老此日照舊在壓這車開路下偕夫人翩翩而至，一手嵌雪茄，一手作Ｖ形，向羣衆的歡呼中笑嬉嬉地拾級行進。邱氏今年已七十一齡，或因經此休假，氣色更好，精神示殊　爍，行看回抵倫敦，又不免在終夜　雜的議會中辛苦一番了。</p>
<p>臨別致詞</p>
<p>邱老在紐約的生活，實在很忙迫的。所居威道而夫大旅館頂樓，自擬演講稿，又常趁妻女出外購物時，遍覽報紙，以觀反應。其他酬酢當然多，直到最後一天，他才去拜訪史培而曼主敎，幷在敎堂祈禱。綜括邱氏此行，大致是很圓滿而愉快的，縱然遭遇非讓及糾察遊行，臨走父確到紐約的「美蘇友　協會」的聚衆示威，但他明瞭，這正是美國人的言論與集會自由，（僅有十三人因不聽警察命令違章而被拘控）。跟他自己所作的幾次演說，全是杜魯門總統所說「我們在這國家內無可干涉他人說話」是同樣的權利的。所以當他落船啓掟最後又對新聞記者暢言一回之後，不由很高興地說着臨別詞：「多謝你們大家，幷願上帝祝福衆人！」（三月廿三日紐約）</p>
<h3>我們也當說幾句話！</h3>
<p>主筆先生：「聯合社南京十七日電蓋除「正規軍」的三百師外，尙有各省地方以及游雜部隊……」這是二月十九日上海某報正面的一節重要新聞。使我抒了懷疑的就是「正規軍」三個字上加上了「」這一個符號。我要問問該報，聯合社所稱的正規軍是否和所謂「解放區」三個字同樣的價値，如果認爲是同樣的價値，我們一定要</p>
<p>提出抗議</p>
<p>我們成千成萬的一羣熱血靑年，在家鄕淪陷時跑進軍隊，參加神聖的抗戰工作，並且還要在事光進入軍校訓練，長途跋涉跑到指定部隊去服務。一顆純潔的心，一腔熱烈的血，去和敵人搏鬥，爭專死生，一年一年地過去。說到待遇，談不上，生活的苦悶，比任何時代靑年要加上幾倍。長長地八年把我們寳貴的靑春埋送了，但是我們並不怨恨，並不非難任何人。我們的目的是對的，我們的意志是純潔的。我們也加入了國民黨因爲（一）國民黨統一了中國，（二）國民黨領導了抗戰，（三）國民黨有一個偉大的領袖，是中國歷史上空前未有的偉人，也是全世界所公認的偉人。我們沒有走錯路，也沒有做錯事，不願任何人隨便看輕我們的人格，也不願任何人利用任何手段</p>
<p>抹煞我們</p>
<p>對於國家的貢獻，甚至對正規軍還來懷疑。</p>
<p>現在抗戰勝利了，我們的一羣，要找新路走，我們不願再當軍人，也不願在政治上有野心，願意當個老百姓。在抗戰期內吃了千辛萬苦，甚至性命也不顧出，死入生幾次，但是勝利後，並不希望拿幾萬元的勝利金，也不希服領到幾千元的遣散費，只要事業有價値，任何犧牲都在所不惜。這是事實，並沒有半點虛假。</p>
<p>可是現在除了幾張國民黨的機關報外，開口就駡國民黨如何貪污，腐化，失敗，效能低等等不相干的批評。我吿訴大家，也許他們所說的有幾個，但不是個個如此，尤其</p>
<p>在軍隊裏</p>
<p>百分之九十九，吃軍糧局發的糙米飯，穿軍政部發的劣布衣服，拿的餉是幾千元一月的生活費如果沒有領袖的感召，民族的意識，我們怎能幹下去呢？</p>
<p>現在好像國民黨的份子不講民主，不議民意，其他各黨各派就拿講民主民意了，再又好像國民黨都是低能人，其他各黨各派的份子都有通天的本領。我們的一羣，一再聲明不想在政治上有地位，因爲自己知道沒有政治經騐，難適各黨各派的人多當過幾次政權？有什麽特殊的功勛，和高能給老百姓看過？政治上作爲，好像開汽軍一般，不是任何人嘴裏說能開就算的，要有訓練要有眞本領，一旦翻了車是無法挽法的。國家大事決不能交給一般生手去做，甚至過做的事情太不使人滿意，並且他自己也承認過錯誤的人來幹。）</p>
<p>民主民意</p>
<p>不是姓張姓李所獨有的，也不是重慶幾個人，上海幾個人能代表全國民意的，也不是個人升官發財的工具，更非一黨一派攫取政權的工具。老百姓看見你的大名，總要問問你過去做些什麼事？對於國家有什麽貢獻？我老實吿訴大家，普通老百姓的一致口號，還是我們相信「委員長」，我們服從『委員長』，因爲他是世界卓越的人物，也是中國歷史上的奇蹟。我們不應當對他所領導的國民黨和他所信任的人，加以惡意的攻擊，且做實際破壞他的工作，更不應當嘴裏擁護他，但是所作所爲同他搗蛋。一個國家忘記了「禮義廉恥」，只講現實主義，只顧一人一黨的利益，犧牲整個民族，這是大大的錯誤。蘇俄的人民個個擁護史達林，才有今天的結果，蘇俄的反對黨在國內能存在否？</p>
<p>我們是中國國民政府的正現軍，民國卅年前有俄顧問來帮助我們作戰，攻擊崑崙關時，我們還看見俄顧問一同吃苦陪我們走路。到了民國三十年蘇德訂立互不侵犯條約，俄顧問都跑回去了，可是我們仍舊打下去。自珍珠港事件發生後，美國人大批來帮助我們作戰，到如今凡是在美國人配　過的部隊，至今留下不可磨滅的友愛精神。我們是世界各國公認的中國軍隊，也是公認的打日本人的軍隊，爲什麼正規軍三個字上還要加「上」這個符號？這是估低我們的軍格及人格，並且懷疑我們的神聖意志。我們正式提出嚴重抗議！（劉　，三月十五日在滇西之雲州）</p>
<h3>王耀武將軍在濟南</h3>
<p>— 六日航訊　本報特派員姜軍寄</p>
<p>『我現在還年青，準備再幹二十年！』　－王耀武。</p>
<p>在新中國的將星羣中，王耀武將軍是近來引起人注意的新聞人物。抗戰八年，始終沒有吃過一次敗仗。湘西大捷，開創了勝利的先聲。這位馳譽中外的將領，究竟是怎樣的一個人？想爲各方所注目。</p>
<p>首先讓記者提筆描寫他的輪廓罷：中等身材，莊嚴正直的面孔，滲透着一股熱情。苦幹力行，誠摯虛心，是）個沒有腐朽官僚習　的典型革命軍人。</p>
<p>軍將年紀很聯，四十二，　在他的官職，是第二綏靖區司令官。從事於這個工的小夥子。但據熟悉將軍性格的人說；他確是具備着成功的條件，除戰功纍纍而擢升職位外，他更富有一般人所不及的條件；得人和。</p>
<p>王將軍平時處人治事的態度，是：多盡義務，少爭權利。唯其能這樣，到處受人歡迎。誰都知道湘西大捷，在中國抗戰史上佔着最燦爛的一頁。可是，王將軍並無絲毫　氣，這種勝而不　的精神，實在値得欽佩。此外作，是正如他所倡導的口號：做人認爲最難做的事，做人認爲最苦的事，做人認爲不能做的事。「句話，就是：他在肩負着收拾山東殘局的艱巨任務。同時，他另有一個光榮的頭銜：中國國民黨中央執行委員。</p>
<p>有人說：他是一個少年得志的倖運者，因爲在民國十九年，他已經是上校團長，那時候，他還是個二十六歲，他還有一種好學好問的精神，樂於採納部下的意見，尊重每申個合理的建議與要求。用人惟賢，毫無地械及自私觀念。在他的事業史上，絕沒有演出過「因人設事」的醜劇。他不輕易接受一個朋友介紹的人，他太人也不輕易介紹一個人，在他現有的高級幕僚中，除副官處長外，找不出第二個籍隸山東者。</p>
<p>他和僚屬之間，在公約方面，相處無隙。在私的方面，尤其充沛着感情的成分。他時常邀集排連長等，共桌便餐，聽取意見，慰問辛勤。因此，每當王將軍指揮的部隊，臨陣作戰，將士們莫不感德用命，勇往直前。</p>
<p>每一個曾經和王將軍接談過的人都會感覺到：將軍爲人和　親切，永遠給人以愉快的印象。他對於朋友之間以及部下，始終保持一團和氣。可是，常工作的時候，却是認眞硬幹，絲毫不苟，這種優良的作風，在他的部下，如今已普遍獲得了「同化作用」。記者曾經在辦公時間留心到他的僚屬，兢兢業業，其工作情緒之緊張，恍如委身戰地工作一樣。</p>
<p>諸如此類的事實，我們可以斷論：王將軍不僅是一個卓越的軍事家，而且兼有政治家的風度。是的，他對於政治很感典趣，他認爲現在中國大多數在政人士，缺乏幹的精神，以致造成目前殘破局面。但王將軍沒有政治野心，他祇希望多做些有利國家的事。他曾經對記者說：「我現在還年輕，準備再幹二十年！」</p>

<h3>崑曲識小錄</h3>
<p>— 羅振之</p>
<p>自梅蘭芳在美琪出演崑劇後，上海度曲之風復振，仩女競相唱和，瀝笛傳音，曼妙廻旋，固較胡岑爲雅馴，而爲優秀之業餘娛樂。考崑腔創始於明末，魏良輔梁伯龍從大倉發明水磨腔，注　四聲陰陽，五音平仄，選傳奇之佳者，摘爲崑戲。所謂台步有戲，袖下有戲，眼中更有戲，如亭會之望樹影，醉妃之臨清流，琴桃之夜半尋侶，皆在詞句抽象得之。即無補景，恍見當時情狀，較今日之話據影片，稍事費解，但有悠然不盡之慨。</p>
<p>別母亂箭，刺虎，伍員寄子，寫本斬楊，岳母刺字等，皆有忠孝義節之大志，亦足以正人心。紅梨西樓，樂不誨淫，玉茗四夢，上紅毺者牡丹亭爲多，紫釵記僅見折柳陽關，蓋李益從軍別喪，感痛　结，霍小玉送至灞陵橋，有词云：「教他關河到處休離劍，驛路逢人好寄書•」情長義重，與時下　之棄之，不亦判若霄壤乎。</p>
<p>唱小生重在風流儒雅，紅梨記訪索中，一段宜春令，婉轉動聽，我友吳翼之，蘇人也，念至「拚醉佳人錦瑟，翠屏珠幌」處餘音如散珠至盤，確可羨聽，近從重慶來客言，抗戰期內，登臺演出，南方人尚重崑曲，成其風趨有轉變太平盛世景象。</p>
<p>王君几與劉鳳叔合編集成曲譜，考訂甚詳，鳳叔嘉興濮院人，有兄龍伯，名富槐，庚子辛丑併科孝廉，執教北大，與弟同寓故歸，弟講求聲律，搜集海內藏家曲譜，幾度糾正，歷數載始成書，吳霜厓引爲知友，曾以自撰院本，請鳳叔點定後填譜，劉亦欣然無宿諾。今二人先後物化，而劉之舊居尚存，有小圃曰瑟園，距城三十里，遺書甚多，闢置一室，子弟能硜硜自守，不改舊家風度，其流澤長戾。</p>
<p>評劇</p>
<h3>「重慶廿四小時」</h3>
<p>「重慶二十四小時」用一種喜劇的手法來揭露人世許多悲慘和痛苦的事實，表現了社會人情中的醜陋和黑暗，更寫出了做人應有的一種好品德：堅持和仁愛。它是笑裏有淚，喜裏有悲。中間更有着一種沉重的心情。</p>
<p>看了「重慶二十四小時」，我們懂得八年戰爭是經過了怎樣的艱難和困苦，加在人民身上的是怎樣嚴　的考驗。他們是在鐵錘與鐵鉛之間被重重的敲擊着，他們需要忍耐，更需要抵抗那種痛苦，然後他們始得新生，始能取得勝利。</p>
<p>我不說這八年來，每個人都在吃苦，都能吃苦。中間有動搖份子，有悲觀失望的人物，更有破壞抗戰者存在，例如囤積居奇的商人就是一個好例子。作者要暴露他們，打擊他們，讓我們笑他們的不合人情，他們的糊塗和醜態。</p>
<p>這是社會的兩個方面，這是生活的兩種態度，它們的對立是無處不在，時間沒有冲洗掉，八年戰爭沒有把它們掃除。現在是依舊存在；在此時此地的現實生活中，更變得尖銳起來了。因此「重慶二十四小時」不但使我們回憶過去的艱苦，而且更使我們正視現在，把堅持奮鬥的精神繼續保持，並發揚光大。</p>
<p>這個戲的導演，僅得笑裏有淚，他不肯讓「笑」變成噱頭的播弄，因此頗能透露此中沉重的情調。</p>
<p>設計者，是重慶來，能夠抓住那裏一般建築的特徴，尤其他在窗外堅立一座房子的遠景，更暗示了這建築搖搖欲墜的樣子，但是更有一種撐持不肯墜倒的樣子，它却象徴了人們在刻苦中堅持的精神。</p>
<p>演員韓非，技巧純熟，情緒轉換，頗得緊扣住那個關鍵，他給我們一個歡喜笑鬧，而內心極爲真誠的性格，他飾康泰是成功了的；而觀眾也最歡喜他了。碧雲演一個柔弱矛盾的女性，真情迫人，我們都爲她的哀感和痛苦而流淚了。馮　的林白　最不能討好，因爲他是一個最多演講詞的人物，因此要把那講詞充滿真情才能使人親近他，而馮喆演來就能有這個好處。其他方伯、謝怡冰，楊英梧，路珊，都演來不錯，這次演出，值得一看，因爲各方面都有好處，它是完整的演出。</p>
<p>影評</p>
<h3>出水芙蓉</h3>
<p>— 陳偉</p>
<p>電影的歷史，到目前爲止，已經有了數十年了，它的進步決非一言之所能盡，而目下「出水芙蓉」一張影片的技巧，可以說是登峯造極了。我們可以在這片于看到非常艷麗的彩色，怪不得在大後方被稱爲「十彩片」。此外還利用了一樣新的儀器Mares　Phere•可以避免水中的折肘角度，而直接明晰的拍水底游泳鏡頭，比起以前的灰暗不明，被深藍色的清水的糊塗鏡頭，自有了長足的進步。</p>
<p>但是聚了這麼多的人力，物力，財力，拍攝的影片却只是一部沒有靈魂的影片，沒有意識，沒有人物的性格，眼睛中只是一羣都會的男女，談戀愛，游泳，演戲，爵士音樂，像俱樂部而已。假使再有人談「電影即教育」一句話，無論他列盡證據，恐怕也不會應用到此片的社會教育性。反之，引誘年青人鐵入色情的圈子裏，或者有很大的可能性。</p>
<p>成都地方，早已映過此片，當時新中國日報上有位先生憤怒地說：「看此一片，可將三年教育，毀之一朝；」此話雖然當之過甚，不過至少他也是一件好心，奉勸都市的青年男女，切莫多看色情影片，而荒廢了自己的學業及事業，在人生的大路上停滯了下來。</p>
<p>棄掉意識不談。再看他的故事，這又是全拷貝的戀愛故事，在游泳池巧合之中，二人會立刻於法官之前結婚，俄而有人請出一名歌女來破壞之，於是一再波折，笑話百出，結束了這一個離奇而胡鬧的故事。所以，同其他喜劇，笑劇一樣，是一張基於戀愛故事的影片。</p>
<p>雷•史基爾頓Red　Skelton，演戲經驗很是豐富，以前專演喜劇角色，這一次飾演一個爲了戀愛，不惜犧牲光陰，跑到維多利亞女學去讀書的作曲家。在全校校中只有此一位男生，因此要受其他同學相同的教育，於是，上舞踊課，穿紅制服，戴一年級生Freshman紅帽子，徒造成了不少的笑料。史基爾頓老練穩重，演技方面已臻成功。</p>
<p>三分之二的影片在會樂聲中映過，這樂隊的配音確也不壞，還有二三個歌劇塲面，佈景燈光都很不壞，最難能可貴的是演員的整齊，一絲不亂。</p>
<p>全片的骨骼是頭末二次游泳塲面，而後者的游泳池照劇情看來，還是一個舞臺，這種舞台真是不可思議了。末塲有開關可啓許多噴水管環繞當中的自來火（Gas）管，水火相映得很有趣，其物力也可想而知•還有那游泳女郎的列成圖案，整齊一列，非經長期訓練實不能臻此，其人力及財力亦很可觀了。</p>
<p>米高梅公司能攝此片，文化水準及教育水準上都是毫無功勞的。然而那一地那一塲不是客滿賣黑市票呢？這是很明顯的給大家知道：「都會的觀眾之愛好到底是什麼？」嗚呼！</p>
<h3>影聞拾錄</h3>
<p>— 藻</p>
<p>「蝴蝶夢」</p>
<p>提起文藝影片，關心電影的人，總會想起「蝴蝶夢」的，它與「亂世佳人」同爲煊赫一時的作品，性質相同，勝塲各檀，可說是輝映影壇的一雙拱璧，至今留給觀眾的印象，還很深刻。</p>
<p>就觀客的擠擁來說，「蝴蝶夢」不及「亂世佳人」是不能諱言的，然而這並不能作爲衡量兩片優劣的標準，前者在藝術上的成就，自有它的獨到之處。</p>
<p>最近美國電影雜誌刊載，紐約大學電影學院，認爲「蝴蝶夢」一片的技術和特質，值得分析研究，已把它列入爲五部電影傑作之一，陳列一部於該校爲五部影片創設的電影圖書館，作爲研究的資料，又在選定該片時，會舉行儀式，由該校副校長Harold　O　Voorhis博士親臨主持，加以判定，並對該片的特點，作詳細的論斷。</p>
<p>從上面的事實看來，「蝴蝶夢」能得到研究電影的學者如此推許，如此重視，其真正的價值，也就可以推見，至於其餘的四部影片爲：「Stagecoach」「The　Great　McGinty」「Hore　Conies　Mr　Jordan」「The　Grapes　of　　Wrath」</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops to Withdraw from City Today; Changchun's Fate to Be Decided; Nationalist Troops Advance Near Siping Street</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] The situation in the Northeast is exceptionally tense. Changchun is on the eve of a storm. Liang Huasheng is currently at the Changtu command post directing troops, removing obstacles to the advance. Du Yuming has largely recovered from his illness and is preparing to leave the pass on the 17th to personally direct military affairs.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Jinzhou, the military and political center of the Northeast, experienced a scare the night before last. It is reported that plainclothes Communist troops were discovered in an area two *hua li* from Jinzhou, but they were quickly dispersed by Nationalist troops. The situation near Suizhong is also quite tense. Communist troops are gathering forces at the Mingshuitang Gate northwest of the city, intending to attack Suizhong.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] Soviet troops will completely withdraw from Changchun in 24 hours. The newly appointed defense commander, Chen Jiazhen, has agreed with Major General Kalov, who is about to relinquish responsibility for the city's defense, to hold their first and last meeting at 9:30 a.m. on the 14th. At that time, Kalov may provide information on the city's defense. It has not yet been decided whether a simple ceremony will be held. Furthermore, the commander of the 14th Air Force District returned here yesterday from Shenyang and spent the entire day inspecting the two airfields after the Soviet withdrawal. One is the Japanese military airfield from the puppet Manchukuo era, the equipment of which has been completely destroyed, and the buildings are also dilapidated, but the taxiway is still usable. The other is the civil aviation airfield, which is currently in use, and the interior of the airfield is generally intact, only the furniture in the buildings has been moved out. After our takeover, our planes have landed at the airfield three times.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 12th] Communist troops occupied Songjiawuzi, a northwest suburb of Changchun, this afternoon. The area is six or seven kilometers from the city center and has no security teams stationed there, only a small number of civilian armed forces. After the outbreak of the war, all city security teams were ordered to enter their positions. Schools were dismissed early, and some streets have been closed to traffic. Major General Kalov, the Soviet city defense commander, sent his deputy commander to visit Chen Jiazhen to discuss methods for restoring order. Chen has ordered his subordinates to strictly guard their positions, and Soviet tanks have simultaneously moved to suppress the unrest, as the Soviet army is still responsible for the city's defense.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Military observers commented on the situation in the Northeast, saying that at least four areas in the Northeast are engaged in fierce fighting. The fate of Changchun will be decided in the next 24 hours. Currently, the New First Army is blocked south of Siping Street, and Changchun is almost surrounded by Communist forces. If no miracle occurs, it will be difficult for Nationalist troops to enter Changchun when the last batch of Soviet troops withdraw on the 14th. Recent news indicates that a unit of the New First Army has bypassed the Communist artillery line in the Siping Street area and appeared at Ershichazi (transliteration) on the highway leading to Gongzhuling. Observers believe that although the Nationalist troops succeeded in the surprise attack, it is unlikely to reverse the situation in Changchun, as there are still many Communist defense lines around the city.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] The government troops advancing northward along the Shenyang-Changchun Railway reached an area approximately 30 kilometers from Siping Street on the 8th. They were subsequently subjected to fierce attacks by more than five brigades of Communist troops. By the morning of the 9th, the government troops had cleared the Communist obstacles and advanced to an area 25 kilometers from Siping Street.

<p>Question: It is rumored that the government has reached an agreement with the Soviet Union, especially to dismantle the Shenyang Arsenal and its equipment. Is this true?</p>

<h3>Northeast Begins Arresting War Criminals; Military Tribunal Established in Jinzhou for Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] The authorities responsible for searching for and arresting traitors and war criminals have begun work in the Northeast and have achieved considerable success. It is reported that among the war criminals arrested, there are still many Axis war criminals. Jinzhou will immediately establish a military tribunal to conduct trials.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Since the victory was transferred, the government has been actively processing war criminals. As early as November last year, the War Criminals Processing Committee was organized by various relevant agencies to plan and guide various war criminal processing matters. Recently, a War Criminals Processing Team has been established in the Military Law Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs to carry out this work. Various relevant regulations have been formulated and promulgated to various military agencies for compliance. War criminals have been arrested in large numbers in various places. Fourteen military tribunals for trying war criminals have been designated to be established by various military agencies in various places to carry out trial work separately. At present, the military tribunals that have been formally established by various military agencies include the Army Headquarters, Wuhan Headquarters, Guangzhou Headquarters, Northeast Headquarters, Lanzhou Suiqing Commissioner's Office, Xuzhou First Appeasement District Command, Xuzhou Second Appeasement District Command, the Commander-in-Chief's Office of the Second and Eleventh War Zones, etc., are all actively carrying out investigation and trial work.</p>

<h3>Decision to Exempt Land Appreciation Tax to Still Collect Tax According to Law</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 13th] It was previously decided that the land appreciation tax in the front and rear provinces and cities should be exempted for one year in the same way as the land value tax. It is now known that there are many difficulties after implementation, because the taxation of land appreciation tax is targeted at landowners, and it is only levied when the ownership is transferred and there is appreciation, which is different from the annual general levy of land value tax. The landowner's flexible filling in of the date of land transfer cannot be controlled. With the decision of the competent authorities, the tax will still be collected according to law. It is reported that the Executive Yuan decided in this meeting to approve the exemption from the exemption.</p>
<h3>News Briefs</h3>
<p>Our Chongqing Dispatch: The Ministry of Finance's Provisional Measures for the Management of Banks in Extraordinary Times are about to be abolished. The new Banking Law will be reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan within days and promulgated for implementation.</p>

<h3>Major and Minor Traitors in Custody in the Capital to be Transferred to the High Court for Trial; Measures for Handling Overseas Traitors Under Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] According to Judge Li of the Supreme Court: The Supreme Court has not yet received Miao Bin's appeal. All appeals from special traitors will only be decided in writing and not formally. More than one hundred and forty major and minor traitors are planned to be transferred to the Capital High Court for trial. The High Court has decided to open a criminal holding room to detain all the traitors. In the future, they will all be treated as ordinary prisoners, given prison rations, and traitorous families will not be allowed to send food. The High Court's traitor trial court is rushing to make six hundred chairs to serve as the auditorium. Once the puppet Manchukuo ruler Bo Yi Lianjing, the High Court will renovate the traitor trial court in imitation of the courtroom design of the US Federal Court, and its site is still in the Dacheng Hall.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 13th] It is reported that the Army Headquarters believes that domestic traitors are currently being tried separately in various places, and how to deal with overseas Chinese traitors has not yet been specifically decided. One is because during the war, our troops were stationed in various parts of Nanyang. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, our troops have successively withdrawn back to the country, but there are many traitors who were used by the enemy during the war. Now, due to the relationship of sovereignty in various places, we cannot go to establish a court for handling. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee has been contacted for opinions on this matter, and it is heard that the meeting will be opened for discussion.</p>
<h3>Marshall Leaves the United States to Fly to Chongqing; Possible Resumption of Negotiations Between the Nationalist and Communist Parties</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] Marshal Yuan Cheng took a plane to Chongqing at 10 p.m. on the 12th (Eastern Time). Several of Marshal's personal attendants were on the same plane.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 13th] The tense relationship between the Nationalists and the Communists during the past few weeks may have cracked, but the current situation has improved. It is believed that this has a lot to do with General Marshall's upcoming visit to China. Observers here believe that during Marshall's return to the United States, the two sides tried their best to attack each other in order to strengthen their respective positions. The failure of the Nationalist and Communist parties to give way to each other on the Northeast issue in the three-person team was not due to the incompetence of General Gillen in guiding the negotiations, but because both sides wanted to strive for the greatest concessions. Today, the news that the Nationalists and Communists are willing to compromise is a good sign of the resumption of negotiations after General Marshall's return to China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 13th] The news that US Special Envoy Marshall is currently on his way back to China seems to give new impetus to political activities in the accompanying capital. Leaders from both the Nationalist and Communist parties held meetings, apparently wanting to end the deadlock that had existed almost since the Marshall envoy returned to Washington. First, there was the meeting of the Comprehensive Subcommittee of the Political Consultative Conference, which attempted to complete the draft constitution so that it could be submitted to the Nanjing National Congress next month. Secondly, there was the meeting of party leaders under the leadership of the Democratic League, calling on the ruling Communist Party and the Kuomintang to quickly reach a compromise on the military and political differences. There is currently no concrete reason to believe that the internal crisis, which had worsened to a dangerous stage during the Marshall envoy's departure from China, has any hope of being resolved. But the optimistic atmosphere here now is very real. There are two main disputes today: first, the most serious issue of the recovery of the Northeast, where Nationalist and Communist troops are in conflict over the reception of the Soviet withdrawal area, and second, the resolution of various controversial points in the draft constitution. An agreement on this matter is very important, because this move can alleviate the current dangerous tensions in the Cambodian Northeast against the background of hundreds of thousands of troops. The Northeast trip of the Military Three-Man Team (including the representative of the Marshall envoy, Shire) may clear the atmosphere and allow the Marshall envoy to start again on the difficult task of national unification.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 13th] A spokesman for the Democratic League said today that as a result of many Northeast leaders calling on the Nationalist and Communist leaders to accept the mediation of the Democratic League, the Northeast issue is very likely to be compromised. Chen Cheng, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, has agreed to a proposal that if the Communist army can restrain its troops and allow the government army to recover Changchun and Harbin, the government army will also limit the scope of the Northeast reception.</p>
<h3>Secretary of Zhejiang Province: Lei Fazhang Internally Appointed</h3>
<p>Also Serves as Mayor of Hangzhou</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 13th] It is learned that the Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Provincial Government has been internally appointed to Lei Fazhang, and it is heard that he will also temporarily serve as the Mayor of Hangzhou and will go to Zhejiang to take office within days.</p>
<h3>Complete Japanese General Election Results Revealed; Conservative Party Secures Victory; Leaders of Liberal and Progressive Parties State They Do Not Intend to Immediately Demand Resignation of Current Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 13th] The Japanese government has not yet released the final results of the general election. However, this reporter has learned reliable information from authoritative sources: The Liberal Party won 139 seats (including 5 women), the Progressive Party 91 seats (including 6 women), the Social Democratic Party 93 seats (including 8 women), the Communist Party 5 seats (including 1 woman), the Cooperative Party 16 seats (no women elected), smaller parties 38 seats (including 8 women), and independents 84 seats (including 10 women), for a total of 466 seats.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Liberal Party is scheduled to convene a general affairs meeting on the 15th and a meeting of elected members on the 18th to determine future policy direction. [Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 13th] In this general election, the individuals with the highest number of personal votes were Social Democratic Party member Kasa Ronofu and the so-called "Father of the Japanese Parliament," Ozaki Yukio.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 13th] The results of the Japanese general election will be announced before the meeting of the Governmental Section of the Allied General Headquarters on the 17th. General MacArthur is currently preparing an analysis of the election situation. He is particularly pleased that 38 women have been elected to the Diet.</p>
<p>[Reconstruction Daily Tokyo, 13th] As a result of the general election, although the Liberal Party has gained the position of the leading party, it has failed to secure an absolute majority of seats. The Progressive and Social Democratic Parties are also evenly matched. Therefore, the direction of Japanese politics after the general election is likely to become quite complex. Cabinet Secretary Yu Hashi stated today that because the current cabinet has the important mission of revising the constitution, there is no need to resign. He hopes to continue to maintain the cabinet until the special Diet session adjourns. According to Liberal Party President Hatoyama yesterday, he has already stated that he will not immediately demand the resignation of the Shidehara cabinet. Progressive Party leader Saito also said that he would not take an active attitude to push for the resignation of the current cabinet. Currently, Japan cannot overcome the difficult situation through a single party or faction, so he supports the formation of a coalition cabinet by all parties. If the current cabinet wants to continue to exist to complete the mission of constitution-making, it must seek the understanding of all parties.</p>
<h3>Political Platforms of Japan's Five Major Parties</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 13th] "Asahi Shimbun" published the political platforms of Japan's five major political parties (Social Democratic Party, Communist Party, Liberal Party, Progressive Party, and Cooperative Party). With the exception of the Communist Party, the other four political parties all retain the Emperor system in their platforms. Regarding the food problem, the Communist Party advocates people's management of food and rationing and suggests exposing hoarded goods. However, the Liberal Party's policy opposes searching for hidden grain among the rich and only suggests raising rice prices, allowing free trade on the market after farmers have paid their grain taxes. As for the outlines of the Progressive and Cooperative Parties, they are similar to the Liberal Party except for one or two points. The Social Democratic Party advocates retaining the Emperor system, which is in line with the opinions of the three right-wing parties and different from the Communist Party. However, in terms of inflation and the food problem, it is consistent with the Communist Party's advocacy. Before the general election, this reporter spoke with people from all walks of life and found that intellectuals tend to support the Social Democratic Party, workers and students most enthusiastically support the Communist Party, but victory will go to the Liberal and Progressive Parties because Japanese farmers still regard the Emperor as sacred and believe that the Liberal and Progressive Parties still represent the Japanese government.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union to Demand Application of Charter to Deal with Franco Regime; Spain Claims Polish Government is a Puppet</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 13th Broadcast: A spokesman for the Spanish Embassy stated today that Spain will refuse to attend if the Security Council invites Spain to attend to hear Poland's accusations against the Franco government. It is said that the current government in Warsaw is a puppet regime that is occupied by the Red Army on its land. The spokesman also denied that German scientists had used Spanish gold to experiment with atomic bombs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 12th, United Press] It was learned tonight that when the United Nations Security Council discusses the case of the Spanish Franco regime threatening world peace next week, the Soviet Union will demand that the Security Council apply the United Nations Charter to deal with the current political system in Spain. According to Moscow broadcasts received from London, the Soviet Union believes that this is the time to apply the United Nations Charter for all countries to jointly take action against the Spanish regime. This broadcast was the Soviet Union's response to the British and American positions, which considered that the current situation should be decided by the Spanish people themselves. The Moscow broadcast said: "The Franco fascist regime obviously cannot be regarded as a purely internal Spanish affair." News from London believes that this broadcast represents the official Soviet opinion. Britain may propose that Britain, the United States, and France jointly discuss ways to oppose the Security Council taking action against Franco. If Britain adopts this approach, Britain and the United States will agree on the one hand that the Security Council should discuss the situation in Spain at its meeting next week, and on the other hand, they may try to postpone action by the Security Council. A spokesman for the United States Department of State said: He did not know about the proposal to hold a three-power conference.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers' Conference Approaching; Important Issues Await Resolution; Post-War Development of Europe at a Critical Juncture; Entirely Dependent on Whether Countries Can Formulate Plans</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 13th] People in Europe are now awaiting the meeting of the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, which will be held in Paris on the 25th, with particular anxiety, because the post-war development of Europe has now reached a critical juncture, entirely dependent on whether the major powers will formulate a peaceful solution. All European countries now expect the four foreign ministers to answer whether Europe will engage in stable reconstruction work or will allow its political, economic, and social affairs to remain in chaos for a long time. They deeply hope that the major powers can immediately clarify the peace mechanism in Europe. However, in view of the failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference to reach an agreement on a peace treaty with any European country, it is almost a luxury to expect the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference to achieve anything in European peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 12th Special Dispatch] A spokesman for the United States Department of State stated today that he did not know that the three foreign ministers, as reported from London, would hold a consultation in the British capital before attending the Paris meeting on April 25.</p>
<h3>League of Nations to Die After Holding Final Meeting Next Week; Aftermath to Be Handled by Liquidation Committee; Proposal by Our Representative Liang Passed</h3>
<p>[United Press Geneva, 12th] The League of Nations Committee today unanimously voted that the League of Nations will announce its dissolution after holding its final meeting next week. Thus, the international peace organization, which has failed for more than 30 years, is declared to be dead. The resolution was proposed by the British representative, and its contents are: (1) The League of Nations will no longer exist after the close of this session, and a liquidation committee will be responsible for handling all closing matters until 1947 and will distribute all assets of the League of Nations to its member states. (2) The International Labor Office will continue to exist and enjoy full autonomy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Berne, 12th Special Dispatch] The motion proposed by our representative Liang Long regarding the issue of mandated territories after the dissolution of the League of Nations was passed by the Second Committee on General Issues this afternoon. All representatives present voted in favor, except for the Egyptian representative, who did not vote because he had previously announced reservations on issues related to Palestine.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Supplies Relief to Our Country; Scheduled to End Early Next Year</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 13th] UNRRA Deputy Director-General Hunter Kendrick, in charge of relief efforts in China, stated today that from the establishment of the UNRRA to April 2 this year, a total of 298,148 tons of relief supplies have been transported to China. It is planned to transport a total of 375 million yuan worth of relief supplies by the end of June, including 111.6 million yuan for food, 22.1 million yuan for clothing and textiles, 24.6 million yuan for medicines, 42 million yuan for agricultural recovery supplies, and 149 million yuan for industrial recovery supplies. China's grain losses due to the war are estimated at 7.7 million tons. In addition to what has already been transported, an additional 3 to 5 million tons of relief supplies are needed. The relief plan for China is scheduled to end in early 1947. China is currently in urgent need of 370,000 tons of rice, and UNRRA is working hard to obtain assistance for this. Rice production in various regions in East Asia is not as good as normal and rely on the Western Hemisphere to export food to provide relief.</p>

<h3>Industrial Recovery and Labor-Capital Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Yin Zhizhong</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, the country needs to adjust to truly countless things; among them, promoting economic construction is particularly important. After eight years of war, China has formed a situation of production stagnation, lack of material resources, and economic hardship. The whole country is shrouded in a low-pressure atmosphere of unemployment and lack of support, almost suffocating. The right solution is to achieve several conditions of production recovery, sufficient daily use, and social stability, so that the unemployed have jobs and the unsupported have support. To achieve these conditions, the rapid recovery of industry is, of course, the key to promoting this performance. We have a large number of laboring masses, and we should use their potential strength and material coordination to work together to revitalize our economy and develop our national capital; so that people can use their talents, the land can use its materials, and things can be used to their full extent, then the country can be prosperous and the people can live in peace.</p>
<p>Before the war, in terms of light industry in our country, because of the low wages and the coordination between labor and capital, we were still able to have considerable gains. At that time, Japan's national power was strong and its productivity was high, and our country was inevitably relatively inferior. Now that Germany has been defeated and Japan has surrendered, the general view is that China's industry can replace some of the domestic and foreign markets, or provide a large amount of supplies. On the surface, this is indeed not a fantasy. If we can seize this opportunity, the bowl of China's national capital can be raised, but if we try to look at the current situation, it is a big mistake. Not only can we not be better than before the war, but the country's potential is even more profound than before the war. This is by no means alarmist talk, and everything is in front of us.</p>
<p>Now, the recovery of labor is being hit. There are only two things: first, traffic is obstructed, second, ports, and third, labor unrest, etc.; but in general, it is political instability, which is the failure of speech, and traffic cannot be smooth, and raw materials cannot be supplied. The trend must not be made in order to recover labor. The obstacles mentioned above have little impact on foreign countries, but a great impact on domestic countries. Because foreign transportation can be restored in a considerable period of time, and domestic politics, if it does not take a bright road, the extension of time cannot be predicted. Raw materials naturally have a relationship with transportation, because of the continuous rise in prices, the more workers are unemployed, and the income of workers who have jobs cannot keep up with the high prices; so the increase in workers' requirements for living conditions is very reasonable in my opinion, but I think labor and capital should sincerely cooperate and not mix in any emotions or political effects. The recovery of the national economy, labor and capital occupy equal importance. Wages are raised to a considerable standard, the capital should be frank to accept, and the labor should also work hard with the capital to produce, so that they can sympathize with each other and understand each other, so that industry can gradually recover and gradually prosper. If we cannot follow this path to enter the door, we will definitely suffer both losses, because the ones who will fight with us in the future are not the labor and capital of our country, but the competition with people in domestic and foreign markets.</p>
<p>Don't think that because Germany and Japan have been destroyed, China can sit back and relax to develop our industry and promote our markets. If the understanding and cooperation between labor and capital cannot be improved, I am afraid that not only will the market not be expanded, but it will also be increasingly reduced. For example, after Japan surrendered, we must have the opportunity to replace it in the Nanyang market, so the reason why we can replace it is that Japan is in the process of Tao Rong evolution under the influence of the times and political laws, and it is not allowed to have the opportunity to recover for a while; while our country is taking this opportunity to step up recovery and step up production. After the recovery, we must double, no, multiply by ten times to increase production, so that we can replace Japan's products with our products. "Time waits for no one", this opportunity is fleeting. And today we are still unable to restore our original position, let alone others. At the same time, Japan has been able to freely develop its various light industries under General MacArthur's promise, and is allowed the desire of the Japanese to obtain a better life from production. If we take the raw materials given by the Americans and the power of the hard-working and resilient Japanese people's labor and work together, I am afraid that the fate of China's industry is not optimistic. Then, can China still hope to expand the Nanyang market and other foreign markets now and in the future? Can we still maintain our original position? Looking back again, if the country does not have special incentives or protective policies, Japanese and other countries' goods can still invade our domestic market, then, wouldn't our sweet dreams after victory fall empty?</p>
<p>Recovery, recovery, recovery first, for the sake of my industrial circles that have left their position. - Of course, most of them are forced to do so. - Recovery is to make the labor and capital engaged in the industrial world return to their positions. Capitalists cannot divert capital to speculation, hoarding, high-tech loans, and other abnormal operations, and quickly stick to their positions to produce; this is the capitalists' recovery. The labor side cannot just listen to high-sounding and pursue theories, and under acceptable conditions, quickly return to his position to work hard to produce; this is the labor side's recovery. After both sides recover, cooperate and support each other to achieve their respective satisfaction. We need to know that there is a big self outside of the small self, and there is a country outside of people. Labor and capital must be patient for the sake of the country. The capitalist makes the labor side able to maintain his reasonable life, and the labor side makes the capitalist able to get a considerable profit. We must not go to extremes and use methods. The labor side's launching a strike is used only when it is absolutely necessary. If it is abused, it will lose its sympathy and effectiveness, because when the capitalist really has no way to go, he can only abandon his production career. This situation has been seen many times in various places. It is not allowed for the capitalist to threaten the labor side with closing the factory for no reason; but when he is really unable to support it and there is no way to appeal, he can only take this step. This is a dead end, a dead end for both sides! We must not have this phenomenon happen. If we want to prevent this unfortunate phenomenon, we can only sympathize with each other, understand each other, and be patient with each other.</p>
<p>The opportunity is fleeting. If our labor and capital can truly cooperate sincerely from today onwards, I believe that even if there is external competition, the future is still bright. Unlimited manpower, inexhaustible raw materials, and deep international friendship are all the foundation of our industrial circles, but we can no longer hesitate and wait and see. How the "grand plan" will be in the future, there is no need to talk about it; the labor side and the capital side must quickly recover and sincerely work together hand in hand and work hard in their respective positions.</p>

<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>County Government Seals Up Zhonghua Pawnshop</p>
<p>Han Ren (Korean) Zhuo Shicai, using the name Jiang San of Japan during the enemy's occupation of Songcheng, opened a Zhonghua Pawnshop. After the victory, he changed it to Zhonghua Heji Pawnshop. Zhuo Shicai, fearing that his actions would be reported, secretly left Songcheng and entrusted his brother Zhuo Shirong to manage the pawnshop. Recently, he privately transferred it to Tong Huaiyu to take over. The county government believes that Korean prisoners and overseas Koreans are currently being concentrated for repatriation to their home countries. The handling of all Korean property should naturally be submitted to the provincial government for processing. Before receiving instructions, no unauthorized transfer is allowed. Therefore, officials were immediately dispatched to order the pawnshop to close and all business assets were inventoried and sealed.</p>

<h3>Transfer of Traitor Assets Begins Yesterday; Handling Bureau Conducts Inventory; Assets of Wu Kaisheng and Five Other Households; Complete Transfer Expected to Take Two Months; Difficulties in Handling Discussed by Head of Traitor Asset Section</h3>
<p>A large number of assets of traitors seized by a certain military agency under orders began to be transferred yesterday to the Traitor Asset Section of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau for inventory and takeover. It is reported that more than 300 traitors arrested by the military agency in Shanghai have recently been transferred to the court in batches. The traitor assets seized from these more than 300 traitors are listed in a clear list for each household. Yesterday, a part of the clear lists was sent to the Handling Bureau. It is reported that the assets of Wu Yingkaisheng, the puppet ambassador to Italy, and Liu Weijun and other five major traitors were inventoried yesterday. During the transfer and inventory, a special commissioner sent by the Executive Yuan was present as a representative to supervise the transfer. After receiving the traitor assets, the Traitor Asset Section will hand them over to the Central Bank, Central Trust Bureau, and Jianghai Customs for management in accordance with the regulations of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau. It is expected that all the traitor assets will be inventoried within two months.</p>
<p>Many Difficulties in Safekeeping</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Traitor Asset Section to the reporter, the handling of traitor assets is not as simple as enemy assets. It is necessary to wait for the court to rule on the traitor's crime before the traitor assets can be disposed of according to the judgment. Therefore, the traitor assets will be temporarily kept in custody. The most troublesome thing for the Handling Bureau is how to dispose of the traitor assets. Especially if a certain traitor is sentenced to death, the main text of the judgment must state "all property will be confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for family members;" what standard should be used for living expenses, and how much should be reserved, there are no regulations in the law. For sentences of five or ten years of imprisonment, whether all the property will be confiscated, or part of the property will be confiscated, and whether the amount of confiscation of property will be increased or decreased with the severity of the crime, there are no clear regulations in the law. Therefore, this group is seeking to establish close contact with the court and consult the judicial authorities on this issue. On the one hand, it is also planning to request instructions from the Executive Yuan to determine a solution. In addition, another difficult problem is the safekeeping problem after the takeover. At present, part of the traitor assets is guarded by soldiers sent by a certain military agency, but after the transfer, the soldiers sent by the military will be withdrawn, and the Handling Bureau will have to transfer a large number of personnel to take over the guard.</p>
<p>Careful Prevention of Corruption</p>
<p>Another part of the traitor's houses is still occupied by their families, and all the property in the house is also ordered to be kept by them. Whether they will continue to be kept by the traitor's family members in the future, or whether other custodians will be entrusted, and how to deal with the houses, are currently under study. It is also planned to invite relevant agencies to discuss and decide on a proper custody method in the near future. The person in charge also said that regarding the gold, silver, jewelry, and antiques in the traitor assets, the Traitor Asset Section will hire experts to identify their authenticity, color, and value, make a sealed package, put diamonds and pearls in the seal, mark the type, accounting price, and price on the outside of the seal, and then include them in a sealed package, one package per household, stating the name of the traitor owner; both ends of the sealed package will be stamped with sealing wax by the person in charge of the transfer and inventory, and sent to the Central Trust Bureau for safekeeping, in order to prevent abuses.</p>

<h3>A Red Dancer is Conned by a Big Swindler; Daring to Impersonate Relatives of Mayor Qian and Making a Big Show; Pretending to be an Attendant, a Bodyguard, and a Rich Man; Chen Lili Actually Falls into the Trap</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Chen Lili, a red dancer at the MGM Ballroom (20 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 442 Fumin Road, Nanshi), was recently swindled out of a gold watch and 1 million yuan in legal tender by Huang Bodu (33 years old), a big swindler from Sichuan. The case was only solved yesterday. It is reported that the big swindler falsely claimed that the mayor was his uncle, dressed in Western suits, and acted lavishly. He also claimed that his accomplice Jiang Yiping (from Jingjiang) was his bodyguard and Zhao Atu (from Shaoxing) was his attendant. He also managed to borrow a car from a former bank manager surnamed Zhu and lied that the car was his own. He also forged many documents, such as the Chief Secretary's Office of the state-run China Merchants Bureau issuing a commission to him as a purchasing agent for the Jiangxin ship. When he met Lili a month ago, he spoke sweetly and used various means of seduction. He asked the woman to quit dancing and stay at home. He also forged an "engagement invitation" with Chen, with Mayor Qian's name as the issuer. He also booked the International Hotel on the 31st of last month to hold a fake wedding, with Qian Dajun as the officiant. At first, Chen's parents quite believed it to be true, and they were successively swindled out of 1 million yuan in cash and watches, etc. However, he subsequently avoided meeting, and on the 3rd of this month, the person claiming to be Huang Bodu went to Yongfeng Silver Shop to exchange a gold ring and tricked the woman to go out again. The woman's mother, Ms. Weng, had already discovered that she had been swindled, so she reported it to the Penglai Road Police Station. Branch Director Yao ordered Yao Zhilong, the criminal section chief, and staff members Yang Mianzhi, Zhang Shusheng, Yang Lian'geng, and Chen Hailin to investigate. After ten consecutive days, they finally arrested Huang and the four accomplices, Jiang Yiping, Zhao Atu, and Huang Baobao (a woman who is Huang's concubine), at the Vienna Ballroom at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. They then went to Huang's room No. 38 in the Changzhou Inn at No. 11 Hua'an Lane at the end of North Zhejiang Road, and seized the original stolen watch and a large number of forged documents, resumes, and small photos. The Criminal Section of the Branch has already confirmed that the suspect has committed two previous cases, so the number of victims may be more than just Chen. It is hoped that other victims will report to the Penglai Branch to facilitate verification.</p>
<h3>Residents of Harbin Road and Other Areas Petition</h3>
<p>Residents living along Kulun Road, Harbin Road, and other areas in Shanghai East were old tenants before the war. After the victory, they renewed their leases with the owners. However, these houses were occupied by the enemy and puppets during the period of the occupation. At 9:00 yesterday morning, personnel from the police agency went to order all the residents to move immediately. The residents were extremely shocked and gathered at the City Government at 4:00 p.m. to petition for relief. The City Government sent personnel to meet with them and requested assistance from the agency in charge of enemy and puppet housing.</p>
<h3>Xi Yushu Expresses Full Agreement with the Executive Yuan's Housing Allocation Measures</h3>
<p>In order to alleviate the housing difficulties of civil servants, the Executive Yuan has specially stipulated seven measures for allocating houses to various agencies in Shanghai. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Mr. Xi Yushu, executive director of the Free Association, and talked about the newly established housing allocation measures. According to Mr. Xi, the allocation measures are not fully in line with the actual situation in this city. Enemy and overseas Chinese living in houses owned by enemies and puppets are ordered to be taken over and sold uniformly, while those not owned by enemies and puppets are ordered to be leased uniformly, which seems unfair. During the period when the enemies and puppets were entrenched, civilian houses were forcibly occupied, and people suffered deeply. Now that the enemies have surrendered for more than half a year, there are many enemy and puppet houses left, most of which have been recovered by the owners for their own residence or leased with a contract. Repairs and renovations to the houses are unavoidable, and a lot of money has been spent. Now that new measures are being formulated late, forcing them to move will cause further damage to the people. Moreover, the contracts concluded by both parties will also become invalid, and the handling of disputes between landlords and tenants will only become more chaotic. I believe that people who return to Shanghai need housing, and we should find ways to solve it. However, I hope that the authorities should prioritize the fair and reasonable allocation of enemy and puppet houses. If it is still not enough, they can negotiate with housing and real estate companies to allocate a part of the housing for civil servants to rent. Forcibly enforcing this will not only infringe on the freedom of people to live, but also increase the pain of the people who have long been trampled on by the enemies and puppets. Government measures should be based on facilitating the people, and should also take into account the facts, so that all laws and regulations can be implemented to the greatest extent possible. I hope that the Executive Yuan will reconsider this housing allocation measure.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Murder on North Henan Road; Boatman Shot Dead</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Lu Rongsheng, a 30-year-old from Songjiang, earned his living by rowing a boat. He came to Shanghai from his hometown a few days ago and stayed in a small inn. Yesterday morning at 10:00, he went to a certain bank to withdraw a large amount of legal tender. When he went to the toilet inside No. 365, North Henan Road, bandits followed him. They immediately rushed forward, displayed firearms, and robbed him of the large amount of money he was carrying. Lu shouted for help, and the bandits fired a shot, which hit his abdomen. He fell to the ground injured. The bandits took advantage of the situation to escape with the stolen goods. The injured man was sent to the Municipal Fourth Hospital by the police but died.</p>
<h3>Efforts to Ensure Thoroughness in Grain Loan Processing; Establishment of a Subcommittee to be Responsible for Review</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office has been ordered to handle the case of grain merchant loans. There have been many reports in the local newspapers of this city in recent days. The content has slightly varied. In order to clarify the truth, the reporter visited the person in charge of the office, who provided a detailed explanation. The office considers this matter to be of great importance to ensuring the abundance of food for the people of this city, so the handling is extremely prudent and prompt, and the procedures are also as thorough as possible. After approval, a review subcommittee has been established, jointly organized by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Soybeans and Rice Industry Association, and the lending bank, to be responsible for the introduction and review. It is reported that the first batch of reviews includes 17 companies with bank guarantees, but this is a pilot project. If it is effective, it will be continued to promote. Those who apply for loans must follow the procedures stipulated by the office. The procedures are quite strict, and the key points include: the loan must be used entirely to purchase grain in the producing area, and must be sold entirely in the market of this city. The review committee will supervise whether the applicant is handling the matter in accordance with the regulations at any time. If there are any cases of concealment, misrepresentation, speculation, or hoarding, they will be severely punished in accordance with the law once they are discovered.</p>
<h3>General He Returns to Nanjing Today; Mayor Qian Hosts a Banquet at the New Life Club Yesterday</h3>

The warehouse management in Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and other places was poor, and the organization of materials was not good. (2) The discipline of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in Shanghai was poor, and there were cases of extortion, beating people, beating theaters, and beating ballrooms. The relevant responsible officers should take practical responsibility, and it is hoped that the mayor and the garrison headquarters will strictly deal with them. (3) The matter of troops occupying civilian houses should also be corrected and quickly returned. If it is enemy and puppet property, it should also be rented by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau in accordance with the stipulated procedures and must not be forcibly occupied.</p>

<h3>Higher Court Yesterday Heard Three Cases of Traitors; Son of the Late Hu Bailongshan; Wang Shuxian Released on Bail, Did Not Appear in Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The High Court opened one investigation court and two collegiate panels yesterday afternoon to hear cases of accused traitors. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Shuxian - 54 years old, from Wuxing. He is the son of the late famous calligrapher and painter Wang Yiting, known as Bailongshan Ren. He was recently prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office. The indictment alleges that in March of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), the defendant served as a standing director and head of the Shipping Department of the China Shipping Company, jointly operated by the puppet government's Ministry of Construction and the enemy's East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd. He colluded with another defendant, Yu Jianmin (46 years old, from Zhenhai), to open the New China Shipyard, repairing the puppet ship "Tiansheng Maru" for the enemy. Claiming a lack of funds to pay for the repairs, after the victory of the war of resistance, he took 31.5 tons of iron material and hid it in Nanshi. After being investigated and seized by the Penglai Road Police Station, he was transferred to this office. After investigation, it was deemed that he had violated the Regulations on Punishing Traitors and was therefore prosecuted. After the case was accepted by the High Court, it was personally tried by Court President Liu Yugui yesterday. Wang Shuxian was granted bail and was absent yesterday. According to the defendant's lawyer, the defendant went to Huzhou on business and could not return in time. The other defendant in custody, Yu Jianmin, stated that the China Shipping Company was a commercial institution, and Wang Shuxian had no shares in the New China Shipyard. Regarding the repair of the "Tiansheng Maru," he stated that because the China Shipping Company had no money to pay, 31.5 tons of iron bars and plates were used as collateral. He denied that the "Tiansheng Maru" was used to load military supplies for the enemy. The ship is a small wooden-hulled ship, now renamed "Jianghong Lun" by the China Merchants Bureau, which the court can inquire about. He also hired lawyers Fei Xizhen and Zhou Yongquan to defend him. The court ordered the case to be heard again at a later date.</p>
<p>Shi Yuwen, Luo Tingzhang, Gao Qingyu, and Xing Shimin - These four previously served as police officers at the Huashan Road Branch of the puppet police bureau. In February of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), they were found guilty of extorting Zhu Debao of Daxi Road, Yidingpan Road, and were sentenced to imprisonment by the puppet court. The High Prosecutor's Office is now re-investigating and prosecuting them for treason. A debate court was opened yesterday, and the defendant was defended by lawyer Zhou Yongquan, appointed by the court.</p>
<p>Huang Wenlong - 24 years old, from Shanghai. He graduated from the Nie Zhongcheng Chinese Children's Public School. He was recently reported by Xu Jianyuan, who claimed that Huang had served as a staff member of the Foreign Affairs Section of the puppet Haimen County Government in Jiangsu Province and had used his position to seize 450 bundles of firewood. The High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution, and when the court opened yesterday, the defendant denied all the allegations. He also hired lawyer Gu Wenguang to defend him. The court ordered that the debate in the above two cases be concluded and that the verdict be announced at 2:30 PM on the 20th.</p>

<h3>Credit Eases, Buyers Flock, Gold Prices Gradually Rise, US Dollar Also Breaks Through 2,000 Mark</h3>
<p>Red continues to rise yesterday. The Bank of China's allocation price is still 1.6 million. At this time, because the market price is lower, no one registers. It is said that there are 40 bars allocated. Starting next week, the Bank of China will require gold traders to register for allocation, and each bar must prepay a security deposit of 500,000 yuan to prevent returns after registration. After 11:00 AM, it exceeded the allocation price, and the situation became even stronger. The allocation price next Monday is attracting much attention. Whether the gold market will rise again is a critical moment for the Bank of China, which has been controlling it for a long time. It opened flat, and once fell after opening, but buyers used the loose credit to continue their activities. After selling stocks, speculative funds flowed in, and scattered buyers gathered everywhere due to the current situation, gradually pushing the price up. After 10:00 AM, it was still hovering around 1.57 million. When the US dollar exceeded the 2,000 mark, the gold market also broke through the 1.6 million mark. At noon, it was around 1.63 million. After 2:00 PM, some kind of pressure increased, and it broke into the 1.6 million mark again, finally stabilizing, and closing 55,000 higher than the previous day, ornamental gold 174,000, silver ingot 1,500, silver dollar 1,005. The shadow interest rate is even more abundant, with interest rates ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 jiao.</p>
<p>In the foreign exchange market, the US dollar's buying trend was repeatedly launched under semi-speculative and semi-actual sales. Speculators used their abundant strength, coupled with large-scale imports of merchant ships, and non-compliant settlements were bound to borrow cash to offset the price, and the process was very firm. Although the US exchange rate has not changed, the overall trend is upward, and there is hope that Liu will have flexible management. It opened at 1,970 yuan in the morning and struggled around 1,950 yuan. After that, the gold market rose, and US dollar buyers continued to flow in, calling each other. After 11:00 AM, it broke through the 2,000 yuan mark, and at noon it was already standing firmly above the US exchange rate. In the afternoon, the electric market fell back, and the rising trend was blocked. As a result, it closed 70 yuan higher than the previous day. Hong Kong tickets, new and old, are at par value. As a result, the old goods are 5 yuan better, and the new goods are 10 yuan higher. The US exchange bank's transaction price is 2,000 yuan, and the buying price has slightly increased to 1,960 yuan. The Hong Kong Electricity Robbie is stable.</p>
<p>Rumors About Foreign Exchange Lengthening Are Pure Fabrications</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] For the past two days, gold and currency market speculators have moved with the slightest opportunity, and news about the lengthening of foreign exchange has been circulating from time to time, causing the trend of gold and exchange rates to strengthen again in the past two days. The reporter specifically inquired about this matter from relevant parties. It is reported that the rumor that the supply of foreign exchange positions is limited is completely untrue. The lengthening of foreign exchange is also purely a rumor fabricated by speculators in an attempt to gain speculative profits. Yesterday, the highest peak of the gold market once reached 1.62 million. Seeing the situation, the Central Bank immediately entrusted gold shops to sell a small amount of gold, and the market situation stabilized.</p>
<h3>In the Midst of New Tea Season, Tea Merchants and Companies Spring Up, Planning to Develop Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>New teas from various places are coming on the market one after another, and the industry is actively planning to develop foreign trade. Newly established companies are springing up like bamboo shoots after the rain. As for the new Longjing tea, according to news from the Wenhang production areas, customers are still loading and transporting it these days, and it is expected that there will be wholesale arrivals within a few days. Old tea varieties have little turnover and are as tired as before.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Are Firm, Coarse Grains and Oil Cakes Are All Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market saw balanced arrivals and sales. Shippers of bagged rice could not make a profit and sold very firmly. Japonica rice rebounded by 300-500 yuan. Both "Baiyuan" and "Laiqu" varieties remained temporarily stable. Arrivals of "Yinyuan" were not as good as sales, and the price continued to rise by 1,000 yuan. Flour from Chaozhou was actively traded, and it rose by another 800-900 yuan. Bean skin gradually increased and continued to increase by its own yuan. Soybeans were firm in the morning. In the afternoon, the price of high-quality soybeans rose by 1,000 yuan due to small purchases from Shantou. The price of medium and low-quality soybeans in the local market rose by 300-500 yuan without being active. Raw peanuts were actively retailed and rose by another 1,000-1,100 yuan. The situation in Shantou was tight, and the price increased slightly by 500-600 yuan to 1,000 yuan at noon. Cotton cake also rose by 100-200 yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to news from the rice market, a total of more than 6,000 shi of seven types of rice, including japonica rice, arrived in the city yesterday. The types are as follows: japonica rice 3,068 shi, "Baoshao" 1,165 shi, early rice 1,025 shi, "Yang" 390 shi, indica rice 531 shi, "Baiyuan" 77 shi, "Yinyuan" 146 shi.</p>
<h3>White Tung Oil Continues to Arrive, Rosin's Situation is Weak</h3>
<p>Exports of white tung oil are still uncertain. Recently, Han tung oil has continued to arrive, which could have been smooth, but exports are still hindered because foreign exchange cannot be calculated. According to a Han telegram, it has fallen to 54,000 yuan, which must be 62,000-63,000 yuan in Shanghai. The US telegram currently shows the price of oil at 38 and 8/3 cents, which seems to be passable based on the current exchange rate, but it is not known whether the exchange rate can stabilize. Therefore, whether foreign trade can be smooth in the future depends on whoever takes the lead. As for domestic sales, they could have been launched, but they were delayed due to prolonged rainfall. The selling prices of various companies have been slightly reduced, generally between 67,000-68,000 yuan and 70,000 yuan, and tung oil continues to arrive. Zhejiang tung oil is expensive, and no one cares about it.</p>
<p>After a long period of rain, the sales of rosin and Shantou could have been prosperous, but the sales of factories that make rosin are still silent, and the sales of soap are not as lively as expected. The reason is that all commodities are trending downward, and the public's psychology cannot help but hope for lower prices, so the way forward has not been smooth. The price that each firm sold over 55,000 yuan, delivery at the factory, now each factory hopes for lower prices, while sellers want to maintain the original price, and the transaction is deadlocked, but the market is indeed weak. Recently, firms have sold Kaihe Benzhi for 60,000 yuan, Inner Ping oil for 50,000 yuan, Degan oil for 46,000 yuan, Lan oil for 42,000 yuan, and Macheng oil for 38,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Arrives and Sells, The Saying That Manila is Not Allowed to Export, The Appetite of Hankou Gang is Very Strong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Last month, more than 3,000 barrels of US-made caustic soda from Manila arrived, and the market price plummeted from 600,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan, and there is still no owner. On the green factory side, due to the weak sales of products and weak appetite, it is said that Bu Neimen Foreign Company will arrive with more than 1,000 barrels of Yuepai, which will soon be allocated to each factory. However, according to news from overseas Chinese, Manila does not allow the export of caustic soda. The future market is still expected to rise. In addition, the appetite of the Hankou gang is very strong, the market price in Hankou is around 800,000 yuan, and American goods also need 600,000 yuan. In addition, Fuhua Lin yellow petroleum jelly, bleaching powder, etc., have also arrived in the United States.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds and Chinese Stocks are Gradually Becoming Lukewarm, Speculative Funds Are Concentrated in Foreign Stocks Again, The Hong Kong Stock Market is Established</h3>
<p>The situation of government bonds is uncertain, and both bulls and bears have settled each other. Tong Bing opened steadily in the morning, falling to a minimum of 4,220 yuan, and then rising back to around 4,500 yuan. At noon, it hovered below 4,400 yuan. Big players are waiting for opportunities. As a result, Tong Bing Ding rose slightly, Jia Yi remained flat, and Wu Zhong fell slightly. Chinese stocks were initially stable and then weakened. The bulls made their best efforts, but holders transferred their funds abroad, and low prices were seen near noon. The initial high prices were Yongsha 5,330 yuan, Meiya 4,350 yuan, and Weilong 448 yuan. Although there was a lot of struggle along the way, most speculative funds tended to foreign stocks and gold and silver. The selling pressure was strong. As a result, Yongsha Meiya Jingfu three popular stocks each saw a half a share of light. Xinguang Qinxing fell by 10%. Except for Rongfeng's higher transaction price, the rest of the colder stocks continued to decline slightly. In the afternoon, the term delivery for the week ended on Saturday, and speculative funds from foreign stocks in Chinese stocks returned. The power faction of the Chinese Merchants Bank continued to absorb them. The bank's own account was satisfied with the collection of Yisha, and Yinglian became more popular. The supply from foreign merchants was extremely limited. Under the public's favor, foreign stocks also rumored that the stock market organized by Jewish merchants in Hong Kong has been established, which is even more dazzling. Yisha once fell to below 12,000 yuan due to the settlement of overnight profits, but large speculators abandoned Chinese stocks and gradually moved speculative funds. Finally, the price rose steadily. Before noon, both Yisha and Yinglian saw a high price of 14,000 yuan, but then they turned stable due to profit-taking. The afternoon closing was Yisha Yinglian the most popular, rising by about 10% alone, and the rest were stable. The situation followed in the footsteps of Chinese stocks, and only one or two popular stocks were manipulated.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Wants to Rise but is Powerless, Spot Cotton Trading is Still Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market started to rise but ended weakly. In the early morning, 20 counts of miscellaneous brands were shouted at a high of 230,000, but because there were few buyers, they could not support it. Moreover, Shuangma did not rise, so it immediately fell back. People's hearts were not as excited as the day before. It is now powerless for the yarn market to rise. Whenever the price is high, a large number of manufacturers will sell, and it is not easy to fly high for a while. Comparing the closing market with the previous day, it is about 10,000 yuan better, but Shuangma fell by 15,000 yuan instead.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York US cotton plummeted 57 to 72 points, with recent US dollars at 27.30, forward at 27.36, and Meterlin spot at 27.87. Trading of spot cotton in Mubu is still good. Shenxin No. 2 Factory entered 400 bales of Taicang flowers, and the industry did each other, which was quite lively, about 800 to 900 bales. In addition, Fangjian and most private yarn mills did not negotiate, and the market price was slightly softened by the stimulus of the plummeting US cotton.</p>
<h3>Business Information Summary</h3>
<p>Sugar: Each gear continued to decline slightly. The China Sugar White Association trained Sheng to 43,500 yuan, and the line sold 44,000 yuan. The number of square openings such as Shangxin Shiqing has entered the 50,000 mark, at 48,000 yuan, and Diaoging opened the door at 14,000 yuan, and other secret plates were even inferior.</p>
<p>Daylily: The bottom of the area has been sparse. According to news from Zhenjiang, it has risen instead. Therefore, the Shanghai market has not been able to fall too low. The current top plate is 130,000 yuan for Zhuangcai, 120,000 yuan for Daxingcai, and 110,000 yuan for ordinary goods.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: There are few transactions, and the guest help is also clear. The Sichuan Gang felt that the Shanghai price was higher than the Sichuan price, and they were all hovering in the middle of fatigue because China Textiles opened for sale.</p>
<p>Silk: The raw silk factory rose with the price of gold, and the foreign banks had better appetite. Many sellers of man-made silk, and the price fell unanimously. The silk market soared. At first, I heard that the price of gold was soaring, and the shorts were panicked, and they rushed to replenish, coupled with active actual sales, the market price rose unanimously.</p>

<h3>Travel· Speech· Tasting the Sweet, Sour, Bitter, and Spicy: Churchill in America</h3>
<p>— March 23rd Dispatch by Air. Special Correspondent in the United States for Three Newspapers, Zhu Jiarang</p>
<p>Former British Prime Minister during the war, Churchill, has returned by ship the day before yesterday after a two-month vacation in the United States. Although Churchill is now in the opposition, his reputation remains strong, especially given the current turbulent world situation, as he is the person who most clearly understands the past events. Therefore, as soon as he arrived in the United States, he naturally attracted the attention of the masses. Coincidentally, the investigation of the Pearl Harbor incident by the Senate and House of Representatives in Washington was still in progress at the time, and some members even proposed inviting Churchill to testify in person. Although the proposal was not passed due to etiquette considerations, it also shows that Churchill is still a figure of the times. Moreover, although he called this a vacation, he was actually very busy, visiting Washington repeatedly, holding cordial talks with Truman, delivering eight speeches, and receiving four honorary doctorates, making the atmosphere quite lively. Americans naturally have both praise and criticism for him, but generally speaking, they are mostly favorable.</p>
<p>Travel Lineup</p>
<p>Churchill arrived in New York on the Queen Elizabeth on January 14th and immediately transferred to Miami, a winter resort in the southern United States, for a rest. He was accompanied by his wife, daughter, two secretaries, one attendant, and two detectives, a total of eight people. This can be said to be his travel lineup. He spent about two-thirds of his time in Miami, USA, truly resting, and began traveling and activity from the beginning of March until he left for England. Now, let's give him a brief itinerary:</p>
<p>Rest Stage</p>
<p>From about January 15th to March 2nd, Churchill spent all his time sunbathing by the sea, watching the scenery, swimming, and exercising. Generally speaking, this old man has had a hard life in recent years, coupled with the difficulty of obtaining materials in England, so he took the opportunity to come to the United States to recuperate. He ate a lot of fresh eggs and local fruits that are rare in England. He also accepted the gift of fine cigars and a wonderful 20-pound fatty chicken. But it is said that Churchill was reluctant to slaughter and eat it. This can be said to be Churchill's stage of resting.</p>
<p>Travel Stage</p>
<p>From about March 3rd to 11th, Churchill met with Truman twice and also visited Secretary of State Bernas, Secretary of War Patterson, and Chief of Staff Eisenhower. His itinerary included Havana, Columbus, Fulton, Richmond, Hyde Park, and Albany, a total of more than ten cities, covering a distance of 10,000 miles. He received four honorary degrees and gave a speech at each, needless to say, the most important of which was the one he gave at Westminster College in Fulton with President Truman. (Churchill had four other speeches, one in Richmond and three in New York, the main points of which have probably been seen in the telegrams, so I won't go into detail here.)</p>
<p>New York Stage</p>
<p>From March 11th to the 20th, when he left the United States, although it was almost the end, it was very tense. As Churchill's trip approached, the New York City government had actively prepared to welcome him, and all the procedures were properly arranged. Especially after Churchill's bombshell speech in Fulton was released, it sparked a widespread wave of welcome and rejection. New York is a diverse city, and security aspects need to be more cautious. Therefore, when Churchill's group arrived by car at Pennsylvania Station, detectives were densely deployed, and the route from the station to his residence was also heavily guarded. The day after Churchill arrived in New York, he went to Albany (the location of the New York State government) to pay a visit to Governor Dewey, and went to Hyde Park to lay a wreath at the tomb of his old partner, the late President Roosevelt. After that, he went to New York to begin accepting the welcome procedures from the city.</p>
<p>New York in the Rain</p>
<p>The New York City government's reception of Churchill reached its climax on March 15th. It happened to be raining heavily that day, but Churchill still proceeded with the planned parade through the city, and New Yorkers were still excited and eager to see him. Surrounded by detectives, Churchill wore a raincoat, held a cigar, and stood in an open car, receiving cheers, always raising his right hand in a V-shape to thank the crowd. This leisurely and elegant demeanor was truly unique. After the parade, he went to City Hall to meet the mayor and receive an honorary citizenship certificate, followed by a grand banquet in the evening, where Churchill gave another great speech, which was broadcasted by all the city's radio stations to every corner of the United States.</p>
<p>Reactions to Speech</p>
<p>Churchill's speech in the United States this time made it clear that he was speaking in his capacity as an opposition figure and based on his personal qualifications, so his words were indeed more unreserved. Therefore, his attitude towards the Soviet Union, an ally, was particularly direct, which led to a counterattack from Moscow and also provoked some resentment in the United States. On the day of the reception at City Hall, a crowd of 1,000 people organized by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) demonstrated; opposing the city government's move, they actually formed picket lines (This question is customary for workers) to carry out strikes and demonstrations, guarding key points and parading, shouting slogans, and surrounding Churchill's residence. On the 18th, Columbia University awarded Churchill an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Three hours before the event, 700 students also held a temporary meeting, declaring their opposition to Churchill's incitement to war. They strongly opposed Churchill's advocacy of an Anglo-American alliance (which he had denied) and the provocation of a third world war. They also disagreed with Churchill's frequent appeals to the "English-speaking people," because doing so would split the world and leave the Soviet Union, China, India, and others in what position. Furthermore, many people are dissatisfied with the practices of the British Empire, so much so that they directly shouted that the Second World War had inflicted deep pain and that we could no longer sacrifice and fight for British imperialism.</p>
<p>Student Slogans</p>
<p>After the meeting, a group of students also formed picket lines and lined up "waiting" on the side of the school gate, with no fewer than two hundred men and women, with signs hanging on their bodies and shouting slogans in their mouths: "No more blood, sweat and tears," "Uno peace, not a tory war" and so on. But because the police were closely monitoring and limited them to circling in a small area, their shouts were not heard by Churchill. Churchill, as usual, arrived with his wife under the escort of a car, with a cigar in one hand and making a V-shape with the other, smiling as he climbed the steps amid the cheers of the crowd. Churchill is seventy-one years old this year. Perhaps because of this vacation, he looked better and his spirit was particularly radiant. It will not be long before he returns to London and suffers again in the chaotic parliament all night long.</p>
<p>Farewell Speech</p>
<p>Churchill's life in New York was really very busy. In his suite on the top floor of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, he drafted his speeches and often took advantage of his wife and daughter's shopping trips to read the newspapers to observe the reactions. Of course, there were many other social engagements. Until the last day, he went to visit Bishop Spellman and prayed in the church. In summary, Churchill's trip was generally very satisfactory and enjoyable. Even though he encountered criticism and picket lines, and even a gathering demonstration by the "American-Soviet Friendship Association" in New York on his departure, he understood that this was precisely the freedom of speech and assembly of the American people (only thirteen people were detained and charged for disobeying police orders). His own several speeches were all of the same right as President Truman's saying that "we cannot interfere with anyone's speech in this country." Therefore, after getting on the boat and setting off, he once again spoke freely to reporters, and couldn't help but happily say in his farewell speech: "Thank you all, and may God bless you all!" (New York, March 23rd)</p>
<h3>We Also Need to Say a Few Words!</h3>
<p>Editor: "According to a United Press Nanjing dispatch on the 17th, in addition to the 300 divisions of the 'regular army,' there are also local and guerrilla troops in various provinces..." This is a section of important news from the front page of a Shanghai newspaper on February 19th. What makes me suspicious is the use of quotation marks around the words "regular army." I want to ask the newspaper whether the "regular army" mentioned by the United Press has the same value as the words "liberated area." If it is believed to have the same value, we must</p>
<p>Raise a Protest</p>
<p>We, tens of thousands of passionate young people, ran into the army when our hometowns fell and participated in the sacred work of resistance against Japan. Moreover, we had to enter military academies for training after the war and travel long distances to serve in the designated units. With a pure heart and passionate blood, we fought the enemy, competing for life and death, year after year. When it comes to treatment, there's nothing to talk about. The misery of life is several times greater than for young people in any era. Eight long years buried our precious youth, but we don't resent it, and we don't blame anyone. Our purpose is right, and our will is pure. We also joined the Kuomintang because (1) the Kuomintang unified China, (2) the Kuomintang led the resistance against Japan, and (3) the Kuomintang has a great leader, an unprecedented great man in Chinese history and a globally recognized great man. We didn't take the wrong path, and we didn't do anything wrong. We don't want anyone to casually look down on our personality, nor do we want anyone to use any means to</p>
<p>Erase Us</p>
<p>Our contributions to the country, and even to doubt the regular army.</p>
<p>Now that the War of Resistance has been won, our group wants to find a new path. We don't want to be soldiers anymore, and we don't want to be ambitious in politics. We are willing to be ordinary people. During the War of Resistance, we suffered untold hardships, even risking our lives, dying and coming back to life several times, but after victory, we don't hope to get tens of thousands of yuan in victory bonuses, nor do we hope to receive thousands of yuan in severance pay. As long as the career is valuable, any sacrifice is worth it. This is the truth, without any falsehood.</p>
<p>But now, apart from a few Kuomintang official newspapers, they open their mouths and scold the Kuomintang for being corrupt, decadent, failing, and having low efficiency, etc. I tell everyone that maybe what they say is true for a few, but not everyone is like that, especially</p>
<p>In the Army</p>
<p>Ninety-nine percent eat coarse rice issued by the military food bureau, wear inferior cloth clothes issued by the Ministry of Military Administration, and receive several thousand yuan a month in living expenses. If it weren't for the leader's inspiration and the national consciousness, how could we have kept going?</p>
<p>Now it seems that Kuomintang members don't talk about democracy or popular will, and other parties and factions use the talk of democracy and popular will. Again, it seems that Kuomintang members are all incompetent, and members of other parties and factions all have the ability to reach the sky. Our group has repeatedly stated that they don't want to have a position in politics because they know they don't have political experience. How many times have people from various parties and factions been in power? What special merits and high abilities have they shown to the people? Political work is like driving a car. It's not something that anyone can say they can do. You need training and real skills. Once you overturn the car, there's no way to fix it. National affairs must not be handed over to novices to do, and even things that have been done too much that make people dissatisfied, and even people who have admitted their mistakes should not be allowed to do it.)</p>
<p>Democracy and Popular Will</p>
<p>Are not unique to the Zhangs and Lis, nor can a few people in Chongqing and a few people in Shanghai represent the national public opinion, nor are they tools for individuals to get promoted and get rich, let alone tools for one party or faction to seize power. When ordinary people see your name, they always ask what you have done in the past and what contributions you have made to the country. I honestly tell everyone that the consistent slogan of ordinary people is that we believe in "Chairman Chiang," and we obey "Chairman Chiang" because he is an outstanding figure in the world and a miracle in Chinese history. We should not maliciously attack the Kuomintang he leads and the people he trusts, and do things that actually undermine his work. Even more, we should not support him in words but do things that mess with him. A country that forgets "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" and only talks about realism, only cares about the interests of one person or one party, and sacrifices the entire nation is a big mistake. The people of the Soviet Union all support Stalin, which is why they have the results they have today. Can the opposition parties in the Soviet Union exist in the country?</p>
<p>We are the regular army of the Chinese National Government. Before 1940, Russian advisors came to help us fight. When attacking Kunlun Pass, we also saw Russian advisors sharing our hardships and walking with us. In 1941, after the Soviet Union and Germany signed a non-aggression treaty, the Russian advisors all ran back, but we still fought on. After the Pearl Harbor incident, a large number of Americans came to help us fight. To this day, the spirit of friendship remains indelible in all the units that have been equipped by Americans. We are the Chinese army recognized by all countries in the world, and also the army recognized as fighting the Japanese. Why are quotation marks still added to the words "regular army"? This is underestimating our military character and personality and questioning our sacred will. We formally raise a serious protest! (Liu [name unclear], Yunzhou, western Yunnan, March 15th)</p>
<h3>General Wang Yaowu in Jinan</h3>
<p>— Sixth Day Air Mail, Special Correspondent Jiang Jun Reports</p>
<p>"I am still young and ready to work for another twenty years!" - Wang Yaowu</p>
<p>Among the rising stars in the new China, General Wang Yaowu has recently attracted attention as a newsworthy figure. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he never suffered a single defeat. The great victory in Western Hunan pioneered the prelude to victory. What kind of person is this commander, renowned both at home and abroad? It is something everyone is interested in.</p>
<p>First, let the reporter describe his appearance: of medium build, with a solemn and upright face, radiating enthusiasm. Hardworking and practical, sincere and humble, he is a typical revolutionary soldier without the habits of corrupt officials.</p>
<p>The general is young, only forty-two, yet he holds the official position of Commander of the Second Pacification Zone. He is a young man engaged in this work. But according to those familiar with the general's character, he possesses the conditions for success. In addition to being promoted through accumulated military achievements, he has something that most people lack: popularity.</p>
<p>General Wang's usual attitude towards people and affairs is: to fulfill obligations more and seek rights less. Because he can do this, he is welcomed everywhere. Everyone knows that the great victory in Western Hunan occupies the most brilliant page in the history of China's War of Resistance. However, General Wang has no arrogance whatsoever. This spirit of winning without being arrogant is truly admirable. Furthermore, his work is as he advocates in his slogan: Do the things people think are the hardest to do, the things people think are the most bitter to do, and the things people think are impossible to do. In other words, he is shouldering the arduous task of cleaning up the mess in Shandong. At the same time, he has another glorious title: Member of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<p>Some say that he is a lucky person who achieved success at a young age because in 1930, he was already a regimental commander with the rank of colonel, when he was only twenty-six years old. He also has a spirit of being eager to learn and ask questions, willing to adopt the opinions of his subordinates, and respecting every reasonable suggestion and request. He only employs the talented, without any regional or selfish concepts. In his career history, he has never staged the ugly drama of "setting up positions for people." He does not easily accept someone introduced by a friend, nor does he easily recommend anyone. Among his current senior staff, apart from the chief adjutant, there is no one else who is from Shandong.</p>
<p>He and his staff get along without conflict in terms of public matters. In private, there is even more emotional connection. He often invites company and platoon leaders to share simple meals, listen to their opinions, and express his appreciation for their hard work. Therefore, whenever the troops commanded by General Wang go into battle, the soldiers are all grateful and willing to give their lives, advancing bravely.</p>
<p>Everyone who has ever talked with General Wang feels that the general is kind and approachable, always giving people a pleasant impression. He always maintains harmony with friends and subordinates. However, when working, he is serious and hardworking, without the slightest sloppiness. This excellent style has now been widely adopted by his subordinates through "assimilation." The reporter has noticed that his staff are diligent and conscientious during office hours, and their work mood is as tense as if they were working on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Based on these kinds of facts, we can conclude that General Wang is not only an outstanding military strategist but also has the demeanor of a politician. Yes, he is very interested in politics. He believes that most people in politics in China today lack a spirit of hard work, which has led to the current state of ruin. However, General Wang has no political ambitions. He only hopes to do more things that are beneficial to the country. He once told the reporter, "I am still young and ready to work for another twenty years!"</p>

<h3>Brief Notes on Kunqu Opera</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhenzhi</p>
<p>Since Mei Lanfang performed Kunqu Opera at the Majestic Theatre, the fashion for singing Kunqu in Shanghai has revived. Young women compete to sing and harmonize, transmitting melodies with clarity, beautifully flowing. This is certainly more refined than Hu Cen's style and provides excellent amateur entertainment. Research shows that Kunqu opera originated in the late Ming Dynasty when Wei Liangfu and Liang Bolong invented the "water-grinding tune" in Taicang, paying attention to the four tones, yin and yang, and the five notes, flat and oblique. They selected the best romances and adapted them into Kunqu plays. The so-called "stage steps have drama, sleeves have drama, and the eyes have even more drama," such as the scene in "The Pavilion Meeting" where the character looks at the shadows of the trees, the Drunken Concubine gazing at the clear stream, and Qin Tao seeking his lover in the middle of the night, all are abstractly derived from the lyrics. Even without stage scenery, one can still vaguely see the circumstances of the time. Compared to today's spoken dialogue and film images, which require some effort to understand, Kunqu evokes a lingering sense of contemplation.</p>
<p>Plays such as "Farewell Mother and the Random Arrows," "Assassinating the Tiger," "Wu Yuan Entrusting His Son," "Writing a Memorial to Execute Yang," and "Mother Yue Tattooing the Words" all contain great aspirations of loyalty, filial piety, righteousness, and integrity, and are sufficient to rectify people's hearts. "Red Pear and Western Tower" do not encourage licentiousness, and among Tang Xianzu's "Four Dreams," "The Peony Pavilion" is the most frequently staged. "The Purple Hairpin" only features the scene of "Breaking the Willow at Yangguan Pass," as Li Yi's departure for the army and subsequent loss caused deep sorrow. Huo Xiaoyu sends him off to Ba Bridge, with the lyrics saying: "Tell him not to unsheath his sword wherever he goes beyond the borders, and to have someone send letters on the road." The deep affection and righteousness are so different from today's casual abandonment.</p>
<p>Singing the Xiaosheng (young male role) emphasizes elegance and refinement. In the "Visiting Suo Zhong" scene from "Red Pear," the "Yichun Tune" is melodious and moving. My friend Wu Yizhi, a native of Suzhou, sings the phrase "willing to be drunk with the beautiful woman, brocade zither, emerald screen, pearl curtain" with notes that sound like scattered pearls falling onto a plate, truly delightful to hear. Recently, a guest from Chongqing said that during the War of Resistance, Kunqu opera was still valued in the south, and its popularity signified a shift towards a prosperous and peaceful era.</p>
<p>Wang Junji and Liu Fengshu jointly compiled a music score, which is meticulously researched. Fengshu was from Puyuan, Jiaxing, and his elder brother, Longbo, whose name was Fu Huai, was awarded a scholar's degree in both the Gengzi and Xinchou years. He taught at Peking University and lived with his brother. The brother studied phonology and collected music scores from collectors across the country. After several corrections, the book was finally completed after several years. Wu Shuangya regarded him as a knowledgeable friend and asked Fengshu to fill in the music after he had set the tune for his own play. Liu readily agreed without hesitation. Now both have passed away, but Liu's old residence still exists, with a small garden called Se Garden, thirty miles from the city. Many of his writings remain, housed in a special room. His descendants can still steadfastly maintain the old family customs, leaving a long-lasting legacy.</p>
<p>Pingju Opera Review</p>
<h3>"Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours"</h3>
<p>"Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours" uses a comedic approach to reveal many tragic and painful facts of human life, portraying the ugliness and darkness of social customs, and further illustrating a good moral quality that people should have: perseverance and benevolence. It has tears within laughter, and sorrow within joy. In between, there is a heavy mood.</p>
<p>After watching "Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours," we understand the hardships and difficulties of the eight-year war, and the severe tests imposed on the people. They were heavily hammered between the hammer and the lead, they needed patience, and even more they needed to resist that pain, and then they could be reborn and be victorious.</p>
<p>I don't say that everyone has suffered in these eight years, and that everyone can suffer. There were wavering elements in the middle, pessimistic and disappointed people, and even those who undermined the War of Resistance, such as merchants who hoarded goods for speculation, who are good examples. The author wants to expose them, attack them, and let us laugh at their inhumanity, their confusion, and their ugliness.</p>
<p>These are two aspects of society, these are two attitudes to life, and their opposition is ubiquitous. Time has not washed them away, and the eight-year war has not eliminated them. They still exist today; and in the reality of life at this time and place, they have become even more acute. Therefore, "Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours" not only reminds us of the past hardships but also makes us face the present, continuing to maintain the spirit of perseverance and struggle, and carrying it forward.</p>
<p>The director of this play only gets tears within laughter, and he is not willing to let "laughter" become a gimmick, so he can reveal the heavy mood here.</p>
<p>The designer, who is from Chongqing, can grasp the characteristics of the general architecture there, especially the distant view of a house standing firmly outside the window, which further suggests the dilapidated appearance of the building, but there is also a kind of support that refuses to fall down, which symbolizes people's spirit of perseverance in hardship.</p>
<p>Actor Han Fei, with his skilled technique and emotional transformation, tightly grasps the key. He gives us a cheerful and playful character, but his heart is extremely sincere. His portrayal of Kang Tai is successful, and the audience likes him the most. Bi Yun plays a weak and contradictory woman, and her true feelings are compelling. We all shed tears for her sadness and pain. Feng Zhe's Lin Bai cannot please the audience the most, because he is a character with the most speeches, so he must fill the speeches with true feelings to make people close to him, and Feng Zhe's performance can have this advantage. Other actors, such as Fang Bo, Xie Yibing, Yang Yingwu, and Lu Shan, all perform well. This performance is worth watching, because it has advantages in all aspects, and it is a complete performance.</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3>"Bathing Beauty"</h3>
<p>— Chen Wei</p>
<p>The history of film has spanned decades to date, and its progress cannot be fully described in a single word. The techniques used in the current film "Bathing Beauty" can be said to have reached the pinnacle. We can see very vibrant colors in this film, no wonder it was called a "ten-color film" in the rear. In addition, a new instrument called Mares Phere is used, which can avoid the angle of refraction in the water and directly and clearly shoot underwater swimming scenes. Compared with the previous dim and unclear, and the confused scenes of deep blue water, there has been considerable progress.</p>
<p>However, this film, which has gathered so much manpower, material resources, and financial resources, is just a soulless film, without consciousness, without the character of the characters, and in the eyes it is just a group of urban men and women, falling in love, swimming, acting, and jazz music, just like a club. If someone talks about "film is education" again, no matter how many evidences he lists, I am afraid that it will not be applied to the social educational nature of this film. On the contrary, it may be very possible to induce young people to enter the circle of eroticism.</p>
<p>This film has already been shown in Chengdu. At that time, a gentleman in the New China Daily said angrily: "Watching this film can destroy three years of education in one day;" Although this is too much, at least he is well-intentioned, and he advises young men and women in the city not to watch too many erotic films, and to waste their studies and careers, and stagnate on the road of life.</p>
<p>Leaving aside consciousness, let's look at his story. This is a completely copied love story. By chance in the swimming pool, the two will immediately get married before the judge, and soon someone will invite a singer to destroy it, so there are repeated twists and turns, and many jokes, ending this bizarre and nonsensical story. Therefore, like other comedies and farces, it is a film based on a love story.</p>
<p>Red Skelton, has a lot of acting experience, and used to play comedy roles. This time, he plays a composer who, for the sake of love, does not hesitate to sacrifice his time and go to Victoria Women's College to study. He is the only male student in the entire school, so he has to receive the same education as other students, so he takes dance classes, wears a red uniform, and wears a Freshman red hat, which creates a lot of laughter. Skelton is experienced and steady, and his acting skills have reached success.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the film is played in concert music, and the soundtrack of this band is indeed not bad, and there are also two or three opera scenes, and the scenery and lighting are very good. The most commendable thing is the neatness of the actors, without a trace of disorder.</p>
<p>The skeleton of the whole film is the two swimming scenes at the beginning and the end, and the swimming pool in the latter scene seems to be a stage according to the plot, and this stage is incredible. At the end of the scene, there is a switch that can turn on many sprinklers surrounding the gas pipes in the middle, and the water and fire reflect each other very interestingly, and the material resources can be imagined. Also, the swimming girls are arranged in a pattern, neatly lined up, which cannot be achieved without long-term training, and its manpower and financial resources are also very impressive.</p>
<p>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has made this film, but it has no contribution to cultural level and educational level. However, which place and which scene is not full of black market tickets? This is very clearly telling everyone: "What is the love of the metropolitan audience after all?" Alas!</p>
<h3>Film News Snippets</h3>
<p>— Zao</p>
<p>"Rebecca"</p>
<p>Speaking of literary films, people who care about movies will always think of "Rebecca." It and "Gone with the Wind" are both works that were prominent at the time, and their natures are the same, but each has its own strengths, and they can be said to be a pair of jewels that illuminate the film world, and the impressions they have left on the audience are still very deep.</p>
<p>In terms of the crowding of viewers, it is undeniable that "Rebecca" is not as good as "Gone with the Wind," but this cannot be used as a standard to measure the merits of the two films. The former's achievements in art have their own unique merits.</p>
<p>Recently, an American film magazine published that the New York University Film School believes that the techniques and characteristics of "Rebecca" are worth analyzing and studying, and has listed it as one of the five masterpieces of film, and placed it in the film library established by the school for the five films as research material. Also, when selecting the film, a ceremony was held, presided over by Dr. Harold O Voorhis, Vice President of the school, who judged it and made a detailed argument on the film's characteristics.</p>
<p>From the above facts, it can be seen that "Rebecca" can be so praised and valued by scholars who study films, and its true value can also be seen. As for the remaining four films, they are: "Stagecoach," "The Great McGinty," "Here Comes Mr. Jordan," and "The Grapes of Wrath."</p>

<h3>Answering Readers</h3>
<p>Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Li Shiru asks: I was running a yarn business in Hankou around 1921 and invested in Shanghai Rihua Yarn Factory under the name Li Yihe, with a capital of 105 shares, totaling 5,250 yen, holding stock certificates as proof. Now that the enemy factory has been nationalized, I wonder how to protect my past equity in the enemy factory? Or do I need to submit a request for return to other agencies? Please advise.</p>
<p>Those who hold this stock can submit a request to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau for verification and handling.</p>

<p>Anonymous Poor Person asks: During the War of Resistance in Shanghai, the government issued patriotic bonds, and those who purchased them were all enthusiastic patriots. These patriots would certainly not do anything that would assist the enemy or hoard goods. The difficult situation over the past eight years is self-evident. I also purchased some of these bonds, but recently, due to urgent needs, I tried to mortgage these bonds to a friend, but was not granted. I wonder if these bonds can be mortgaged to a bank? If you know anything, please provide details in your column, much appreciated.</p>
<p>It is said that the market price of this bond is around 2,000 yuan, but it has not been traded for a long time. Because there is no formal transaction, it is not easy to use it as collateral.</p>
