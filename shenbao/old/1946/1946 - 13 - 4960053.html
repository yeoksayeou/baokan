<p>〔中央社吉隆坡十一日電〕一月三日英警與我國聯絡官之不幸衝突事件，已於數日前解決。據官方消息，此事應歸咎於誤認中國聯絡官爲抗日軍軍官，該英警官認爲抗日軍業已解散，故不應再衣軍裝，並携武器，而從未知馬來方面亦有中國軍官也。中英雙方因故林謀盛上校之軍事葬禮，即將於十三日在新加坡舉行，故亟願和解，不至所有遺憾，並爲避免引起一般無謂之刺激起見，業已議定此事件之解決細節將不發表。</p>

<h3>停戰令頒發後六小時　蘇皖魯豫無槍聲　白崇禧離蚌赴津浦綫視察</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕白副總長昨已離蚌，赴津浦路沿綫視察。陸軍總部停戰命令發出後六小時，蘇·皖·魯·豫各地國軍之陣地內，已不聞槍聲，此因國軍過去爲完成受降及保護難民還鄉兩大任務所採取之戰鬥行爲，殆爲應戰，其姿熊自始至終爲守勢，加之國軍通訊設備較密，故一旦停戰令一下，即行實現。聞平西南共軍截至本日下午十時止，尚有行動，國軍正以極大之忍耐，恪遵統帥部命令。又在魯西曹州附近五十華里處之鄧家屯，有共軍一隊，昨攜械向國軍張師投誠時，國軍甫接獲停戰命令，當與投誠之共軍官兵歡然握手，貼紙為停戰命令宣布後。國共兩軍第一次握手之佳訊。</p>

<p>〔聯合社天津十二日電〕國共雙方停止衝突命令，今日遍傳華北全境，大受歡迎，咸認此乃中國大局之轉捩點。但若干方面仍不無懷疑，認為命令之特徵，將於國軍企圖開入張家口時見之。依照停止衝突協定，國軍得以開入東北，樹立中國主權，該項軍隊可自長城以北開往張家口，傳聞一部份軍隊已在途中，今後將有多數軍隊開往東北當可斷言。</p>
<p>〔合眾社天津十二日電〕中國政府與共產黨間停止衝突命令頒發後，華北軍事已實際陷於停頓狀態。過去數日曾向張家口移動之共軍，最近折回山東方面，但據稱：該處共軍正加緊活動。</p>

<h3>周恩來在二次會報告　經驗得來的敎訓　無條件迅速和公開為解決問題三原則</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十一日電〕政治協協商會議第二日，周會員恩來在會議席上，繼張會員羣後報吿停止軍事衝突商談經過如次：</p>
<p>主席，各位先生，關於商談停止軍事衝突和恢復一切交通的經過，剛才張岳軍先生已有扼要說明。現在停戰命令已下，停戰問題已獲解決，當已不是目前協商之主題，所以他的經過詳情，毋須多所解釋，似使各位先生有什麼問題須要詢問，我當再就所知答覆。現在想就談」判中得來的幾個經駝敎　，略加陳說，以供政治協商會議解決一切問題的參考。第一個經駝，商談停戰，應談有條件呢，還是不應該有條件。國內的戰爭行動，不管其原因何在，起因何處，大家都認爲是不幸的，大家公認抗戰期間不　有內部衝突，抗戰勝利以後，　以和平方法建國，這個，不但國內人民公意如此，即同盟國人民之矚望，也是如此。可以商談停戰，必須求其成功。欲求其成功，如果要爭論條件，一定得不到解決，在初初商談時候，對方都着重爭論停戰條件，終至問題拖延不決。有一次，民主同盟朋友約請政府與共黨雙方代表談話時，黃任之先生說：「商談停止內戰，要無條件的停打」，我們聽了很受感動，認爲這是商談這個問題的好途徑。得到了這種啓示，回到延安，獲得我黨中央的同意後，中共代表團來到重慶，即本此方針提出無條件停止內職，在三人會議商談中，就因此得到了結果，終於發表了停戰命令。這裏有一附帶說明，我在三人會議中間，把原來要提出的也是應該提出的要求，一律子以保留，政府方面提出的條伴，我們認爲合理的無不接受，其可以考慮的，也是儘量讓步，停止衝突，當然要無條件。剛才張岳軍先生所所報吿的條件，不是停止衝突的附加，而是關於停止移動的附加，停止衝突應是全面的沒有條件，軍隊移動我們認爲有理由的即同意除外，如政府要在揚子江以南一帶整軍，其因　軍有所移動，我們可以同意，政府為派遣軍隊去東北接收國家主權，我們也是同意，只有第三點，關於亦峯，多倫的要求，我們無法饕受的。因爲那些地方中共領導的軍隊，已在那裏接收，並已駐紮在那裏，最後政府方面　　　個要求，我們也很高興，終於得到了解決。</p>
<p>第二個經驗，就是全國急迫期待解決的問題，　該馬上解決，還是施延解決我們覺得應該當機立斷，例如內戰問題，全國反對，世界不滿，旣然任何方面都承認這是不幸的事，就應該迅速解決。剛才張岳軍先生，已經說過，戰爭多延長「天，人民多痛苦一天，昨天確明叔先生埀涕而道出人民的呼聲，要求我們馬上解決，這種拖延，不管其原因如伺，來自何方，在解決問題上，是一個敎訓，到昨天早上，問題是解決了，大家都非常高興，但是我們兩方面當事人，却應該認是一件遺憾的事。</p>
<p>第三個經驗，就是談判方法上應該公開，還是秘密，旣然一件事情關聯到全國人民，關聯到四萬五千萬人民的生命財產，關聯到國家的命運，甚至於全世界都關心的問題，何必要秘密，而且這件事情是幾百萬流血的問題，何必要秘密。所以解決這個問題，僅管不能不在少數代表中努力，但這件事情應該公之於眾，此，次停戰問題的解決。雖然由參加商談的兩方代表來辦理，最後得到馬歇爾將軍的贊助促成，但是眞正的力量，還是因為人民有呼聲，社會的輿論督促而成的，因為有了人民的呼聲，社會的與論，引起世界注意，以至有了美國總統社魯門和三國外長會議的公吿，這一切公開的責備，造成解決這個問題民力量，所以我們覺得，不是一件與國家民族和人民有關的事，能　公諸於衆，就能得到公意，認識公意，就能得到解次的標準。因此，在政府代表與中共代表商定的辦法中，一致贊成列入第三項由國民參政會及政治協商會議各推定國共兩黨當事人以外之公正人士八人，組織軍事考察團，會問國共雙方代表分赴各地考察。有人以爲，戰已停了，好像軍事考察團的作用全失了，其實正如今天許多報紙上所說的，這祗是開端的第一步，要使一切軍事衝突眞正停下來，毫無例外，一切交通完全恢復，毫無例外，這是一件艱巨的工程。停戰命令下了，到十三日一律停戰，大的衝突全停下來，小的糾紛在命令沒有傳到的地方，有許多被封鎖的地方，都需要派人去解次，所以監督一切軍事衝突的停止，一切交通的恢復，有待於軍事考察團諸位去考察監督，並且能够提出意見，因此我們從過去的經駝中，得到這探的敎訓，凡是千萬人的事情。人民的事情，公之於衆，是有益的。以上三點，是我們解次這些問題所得來經駝敎訓，總括來說，假如我們都能認識無條件停戰，迅速解決和公之於眾的三個辦法，早事求得解決，人民責備要少些，世界的非難也更會少些，這是一種不幸，很希望今後一切問題能够顧到這些原則，特別是第二三兩個原則，是要引以爲訓的，這是我說的第一部份。　「未完」</p>

<h3>安全會非常任理事　六席已選出五席　巴西埃及墨西哥荷蘭等國當選</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十二日電〕聯合國安全委員會非常任理事六席，其中五席已選出。計巴西四十七票，埃及四十五票，墨西哥十五票，波蘭三十九票，荷蘭三十七票。以上均在第一次投票中選出。加拿大於第一次投票中得三十三票，另有一票作股，不足法定數三十四票，乃舉行二次投票，結果澳洲得二十七票，加拿大得二十三票，均不足法定票數。第三次投票將在下午復會後舉行。當選五席以及加拿大，均在美國代表所散發之候選名單內，第一次投票其他得票者，計伊朗六票，挪威五票，　克五票，丹麥四票。聞蘇聯原贊成挪威及比利時當選，但至最後一分鐘，烏克蘭代表團贊成挪威及紐西蘭當選。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十二日電〕大會開幕前，美代表團提議巴西·加拿大·及荷蘭各任非常任理事兩年，波蘭·埃及·及墨西哥各任一年，但蘇聯對於墨西哥及荷蘭表示疵議。</p>
<h3>蘇聯代表動議卒否決</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕聯合國大會中蘇聯代表，今日提出安全理事會非常任理事六席展綏選舉之動議，經唱名票決後否決，計反對者三十四票，贊成者九票，缺席者入票。此動議係蘇聯代表街頭巷尾長葛洛米柯於大會今日會議開始時提出者，美代表團長國務卿貝爾納斯加以反對，待英外相貝文起立欲為英國對　　選舉事發言，已所不許，蓋對於蘇聯動議，贊成或反對雙方均祇許有兩人發言也。貝文旋乃表示英國反對蘇方動議，准許就此動議發言之四國，計美國與哥斯太黎加反對，蘇聯與紐西蘭贊成。旋經票決，贊成功用方動議之國家計爲：蘇聯·烏克蘭·芬閘。捷克·白俄羅斯·紐西蘭·澳洲。丹麥與挪威，至於拉丁美利堅·中東各國·及西歐集團包括英國·法國·比利時·荷蘭均反對展綏選舉。據葛洛米柯解釋蘇方動議稱，安全理事會非常任理事之選舉，乃頗重要之問題無疑，若干位代表甫於三四天前抵倫敦，自無充份時間與其他代表國商討此問題，亦不及與其他多國政府商討此選舉問題，故蘇聯代表團決定選舉應展綏至下週杪舉行一。貝爾納斯發言時，音調高亢淸晰，間以手勢以助語氣，大廳中肅然無聲，一致靜聽。貝氏向各代表警吿切弗准許樹此「必將破壞大會將來工作之前例」。並謂，此非便利或不便利之事，但係應一個代表之請，而將阻綏已商定之工作。蘇維埃烏克蘭代表團長馬努爾斯基提議，安全理事曾非常任理事席之分配如下：拉丁美利堅各國兩席，渠提議由巴西與墨西哥承乏。南太平洋各國一席，渠提議由紐西蘭承乏。東歐一席，渠提議由波蘭　乏。中東各國一席，渠提議由埃及或沙地阿刺伯承乏。斯干迭那維亞一席，渠提詼由挪威承乏。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京十二日電〕據聞幣原內閣今日改組完成，辭職之閣員六人，已由新閣員五人塡補，俾政府維持其保守的及無黨派性質。新閣員定明農在皇宮內就職。但事先必須獲得聯合國統帥部之許可。新閣員將留任至選舉時爲止，其名單如下：</p>

<h3>廿二個侏儒　將攝制新片</h3>
<p>屋荒聲中發生趣聞</p>
<p>〔聯合社好萊塢十一日電〕米高梅影片公司雇用廿二個侏儒，扮演「三個聽明的笨人」一片中角色。不料洛杉磯房屋奇缺，徧覓不得。米高梅攝影塲祗得自動辦理，將七個演員化妝室各附加廚房一問，每室居住三人，但是還有一個侏儒無處容身。管理攝影塲動物園的愛默生，寫一個字條給主管人員道，「聽說你們有一個侏儒缺少住屋，不知道袋鼠可以帮助你們嗎？」這也是房屋荒中的一件趣聞。</p>
<h3>美經濟專家觀察　世界貿易趨勢</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕政府經濟專家頃提出一九四六年以後世界貿易趨勢之類二大問題，即（一）美國能否生產以供全世界需要之貨物（二）受戰爭　煙之外國，能否取得美匯以購留美國貨物。商務部經濟學專家克來利關於等待美闕出品之世界市塲發表意見稱：「國貨物可謂無一不可出售，外國所需貨物之種類及數量，幾乎包括一切食糧。原料。消耗品。及生產工具。此項需要之股切及廣泛，實難以想像，在若干國家，其人民已五年未曾添製新衣，其需求織物之迫切，可想而知。其他需要般迫切之物，如　劉。鐵路材聯。頗械工具，農具，木材等，不過織其　　大者而已」。克氏預　一九五〇年美國出口貿易讓償將爲一百萬美元，內包括對英全年　出量四十萬萬美元，及對拉了美洲全年織出量二十萬萬美元，其徐對墨西哥·古巴·巴西·阿根廷·澳洲·南非聯邦·比利時·荷蘭·瑞典及義大利之全年輸出量，在二萬萬與三萬萬美元之間。一九四四年之美國輸出總額計一百四十三萬萬美元，此數包括根據租借法案出口之物資一百十三萬萬美元，及商人輸出物資三十萬萬美元，一九四五年最初九個月之輸出總額，計入萬萬美元，內包括租借法案輸出物資五十二萬萬美元，及商人輸出物資二十八萬萬美元。</p>
<p>今假定美國能設法供應鉅大的世界市場之需要，但外　有無　付能力仍屬疑問，目前僅拉丁美洲着十國家擁有大量之餘　，但以之購買美貨，亦屬有限。無餘資之外國唯有（一）向美口吿貸，（二）出售貨物於美國，（三）供給游覽服務，美國欲賡續維持高度之輸出業，必須儘量輸入外國貨物，如此則外國方能獲得美匯以購覽美國貨物。故美國當前急務爲提高國內經濟水準，以俾能在國內造成龐大之輸入市塲。按一九四五年美國輸入總　爲三十五萬萬美元，據美商務部估計，一九四六年之輸入總額，將增至五十二萬萬美元。</p>

<h3>美全國電話職工前日開始總罷工　長程電話昨晨亦告中斷</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十二日電〕美國全國電話職工，於昨日上午七時（紐約時間，上海時間星期五下午入時）開始罷工，全國電話交通遂陷於停頓。勞工部發言人稱，如工潮繼續擴大，使全國電話完全停止活動，將由政府接收電話公司。交通配備工人協會人員，於昨日下午七時三十分（上海時問）開始封鎖紐約之美國電話電報公司，電話交通迅即受其影響，本社紐約分社以電打字機向電話公司詢問時答稱，目前僅能接受緊急電話，橫渡大西洋之電話服務亦受影響。接綫員解釋謂：「因勞工糾紛不能爲閣下接通」。除紐約外，華盛頓·芝加哥·第特律·費城等大城市，亦有工人實行封鎖。電話工會主席魏佛前曾宣布罷工將延至星期一發動，茲已將該項聲明撤回，係因工會未能撤銷封鎖之故。（又據紐約電台稱，最近消息，電話之停頓已不能免，長程電話亦於今晨起中斷）·</p>

<h3>愛因斯坦　談猶太問題</h3>
<p>指英對巴勒斯坦</p>
<p>採分化統治政策</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十二日電〕相對論之發明者猶太科學家愛因斯坦，今日吿英美巴勒斯坦調查委員會稱：余雖從未發表贊成建立猶太國家之言論，但余覺使無處容身之猶太人遷入巴勒斯坦，亦未見有背自然之理。猶太人在巴勒斯坦，當可如親友之共處，余相信阿刺伯族之反對，大部份係由英國製造所成。英美委員當詢愛因斯坦豈不知委治國之英國，如擬使猶太人遷入，當不得不使用武力。愛因斯坦乃謂，如阿刺伯族之反對，非係由於指使，當不致有此必要。愛因斯坦復謂，渠本人覺得英國在巴勒斯坦之殖民地政策，係由英國官僚與當地之「葵士林派」勾結而始得推行，其他證據亦有類此之指示。英國素以善於滋事著稱，渠本人感覺巴勒斯坦不啻爲一小型之印度</p>
<h3>數千哩外　奇葩異菓　可以鮮滴滴送到你的面前　利用空中運輸理想成事實</h3>
<p>〔聯合社甘薩斯城十一日電）星期一早晨，在埃及或印度才從田園裏採摘下來的奇葩異某，到星期三中午已經送到甘慶斯城佐餐。這是戰後商業航空的一個理想，或許在一年之內就會實現。假使眞的成功了，該是兩年來實駝高空飛行的結果。此項實駝始於一九四三年，美農業部以飛機一架，滿載鮮花，自洛杉磯飛往尼瓦達州勒諾城，機上除了幾家航空公司的職員外，還載有西海岸的一個蒔花專家。實騐目的係在決定高空和氣壓對於各種鮮花，如秋海棠·薔薇·梔子。蘭花等有何影響。當時這架飛機在二萬五千呎高空中飛行，外邊的溫度差不多到了零下四十八度，各種花的外面，都裏着一種有吸收性的濕紙，只有蘭花不用紙裏，却密不通風的封閉在玻璃管裏。機中乘客都載上氣氣面具。飛機到了勒諾，把花取出檢視，發現薔薇未到時候，竟已抽芽，所有的花除蘭花外，都枯萎了，密閉的玻璃管，好像是一座小型暖房，不受外邊氣壓的影響，所以裏面的蘭花仍舊十分新鮮，像陳設在花店櫥窗裏的一樣。嗣後研究家繼續實騐，終於有了結論，即任何鮮花可以在普通的高度，即一萬呎左右安全運送，不會凋謝。繼鮮花之後，又試騐水菓菜蔬。其第一次實騐，曾　甘薩城斯某雜貨商的資助，從加州田園裏採下的新鮮菠菜裝入飛機，朝東飛行了一夜，第二天早晨就陳列在雜貨商的架子上出售，接着試運印第安種的桃李和別的水菓。現在橫斷大陸和西方航空公司的恒脫氏，以及其他公司的代表，正在進行別種實駝。但是各人最大的理想，是從印度埃及和其他遙遠國家，空運田園裏的食物到美國去。究竟在什慶時候，理想可以成爲事實，據恒脫氏說：「請靜候六個月，等海外航空載客業務開始後，就可以把各國的食物送到你的廚房裏來」。</p>

<h3>交響着繁音與諧調！　協商會議前奏　……全體會員茶會素描……</h3>
<p>— 趙浩生寄自陪都</p>
<p>有如勝利後首度新歲中的一聲春雷蔣主席在元旦宣怖：一月十日召集政治協商會議，全國人民在滿懷熱望，注視着這會議的舉行。重慶的新聞記者們，半月來，以整個的精力，在面繞着這個事件旋轉。</p>
<p>七日下午三時，參加政治協商會議的全體代表，舉行茶會對一般有關問題交換意見，會塲在軍事委員會會報室。一閒長方形的大廳，四角爐火熊熊，透過綠色窗帘射進來的陽光，使人感到分外的和煦，對着前面一排長窗的牆壁上，縣有主席的大輻像片，和主席手書的「禮義廉恥，國之四維……」格言，在這莊嚴的環境中，舉行這具有歷史意義的集會，人們的心情，感到格外隆重。</p>
<p>代表中，除了莫德惠在東北，張君勱在美，黃炎培·張瀾因病沒有到會以外，出席的三十四位代表，國舊一個長長的桌子坐着，桌上兩個大古磁花瓶中，滿挿着臘梅和菊花，加上油印的文件，記錄的用紙，代表們的皮包，冠生園的紅茶和長箸，把一個長長的會議桌，點綴成一個五色雜陳的圖案。一羣新聞記者，環着在周圍的沙發裏，用攝影機和鋼筆尖給代表們的談話作着伴奏。　右邊的第一位是秘書長雷震，他面前堆的文件特別的多，他首先報吿：正式開會的日期是十日上午十時，決定請中外記者旁聽，中國記者二十三人，外籍記去十五人，秘書處備有出入證。談話開始。</p>
<p>莊嚴地擔任若臨時主席</p>
<p>孫　科先生</p>
<p>沈鈞儒提出席次問題，他認爲可以按政府所發表的名單每一黨派的代表坐在一起，穿着長袍的傅斯年先生站起來，以一口極濃重的山東口音說：按沈鈞儒先生的意見，各黨派坐在一起，那麼無黨派代表坐在最後一排亦無不可，因爲：「本來我們是來敬陪末座的。」於是，問題就照傅先生的意見決定了。民主同盟代表，事先擬好了各項要點，</p>
<p>由梁漱溟作報告梁先生穿灰色長袍，捧着一張記錄着談話要點的大紙片起立發言，他首先說希望大家要多自責，自勉，以造成諧和的空氣。接着他提出關於會議辦法中第四條及第六條之修改意見，以及政府與中共會談紀要中規定各事的實行問題。</p>
<p>永遠堆滿着一臉的笑容</p>
<p>邵力子先生</p>
<p>笑嘻嘻的邵力子這位老先生在梁先生談話結束後站起來，以眞摯而又親切的聲音說：爲了要使會議在和諧的空氣中進行，大家應該多矚望將來，政府這次決定召開協商會議，就是在事實上願與各黨派共商國是。關於梁先生所舉會談紀要中各事的實行問題，專責政府的意思，應該有所保留。其中梁先生所提的取消特務一項，邵先生特地背誦了一遍原文，說明梁先生引用的錯誤。最後，他說梁先生所述各點，是不應該在談話會中提，對這他表示遺憾。</p>
<p>梁先生以首先實行自責的態度說：「漱溟對邵先生的話，表示接受！」</p>
<p>傅斯年先生也覺得梁先生所提修改會議辦法，應該在會議程序問題中解決，關於在第六條中加上「負責」兩字，傅先生覺得政治協商會議本來就不是依法產生的機構，雖然沒有法的約束，但却具有道義的絕大力量，決議案不患政府不實行的。對於傳先生的意見，梁先生也站起來表示接受。</p>
<p>關於議程問題，會議舉行時間問題與表決權問題，曾琦先生，繆雲台先生，傅斯年先生，周恩來先生，都熱烈發言。大家都覺得應該把較容易解決的問題排在前面，較繁難的排在後面。</p>
<p>曾琦主張多辯論關於會議舉行時間問題，大家覺得應該半天開會，半天舉行會外協商，因爲許多位老先生恐怕精神來不及。</p>
<p>繆雲台用「數字」說明表決權問題的所在時，孫院長望着他，說：「畢竟是銀行家的看法！」</p>
<p>陳立夫兩鬢斑白但陳先生面孔上充滿着新鮮生命力的神采，他與鬢髮蒼蒼的王雲五先生坐在一起，時時接談。常要向坐在他一旁的周恩來先生，用耳語和紙片詢問。</p>
<p>三十四位代表，互相傳胞着知無不言，言無不盡的話語，互相傳送着端上來一盤盤熱騰騰的點心。全室充滿着溫暖與和譜。</p>
<p>孫院長再度起立</p>
<p>詞時，外面忽然傳進「立正」的號聲，遠遠的，軍委會降旗禮奏國歌的樂聲響了。於是，全場一致起立，這代表着無限崇高和光輝的聲音，沉重而莊嚴的振動着。「一心一德，貫澈始終。致」中父的遺訓將響澈千古與日月向輝，在這莊嚴的聲響中，今日共商國是的人，將會感到一種偉大的啓示。</p>
<p>孫曉長說明各代表所提的意見，沒有疑問的，秘書處可以照辦，有問題的將正式提出大會討論先生，同王世杰部長特別對新聞記者們提出一些珍貴的意見，邵力子先生最後申明，因爲是協商，所以人數不能太多，希望各方面要求參加的人原諒！</p>
<p>孫院長宣佈散會時，已經是五點一刻，大家分別趕赴中共在勝大厦中舉行鷄尾酒會。</p>
<p>邵從恩走出會塲時候，一位在等候着照扶他的小姐走上來給他繫圍巾，戴帽子，攙扶着他走下台階，王雲五先生的三公子常天上午結婚，他臉上還帶幾分喜氣。政治協商會議的前奏曲，在極融洽愉快的空氣中結束。一個好的開始，就等於成功了一半。（一月九日寄）</p>

<h3>新的景象·熱的氣氛　廣州一日</h3>
<p>— 本報廣州特派員　梁風</p>
<p>爆竹一聲除舊！</p>
<p>現在代之而興的，却是粵海關嘹喨而幽美的鐘聲，以及震人心魄的汽笛長鳴。在這寂靜的深夜，那鐘聲與汽笛合奏的韻調，迴蕩整個的五羊城。前者吿訴人們「勝利年」已降臨，後者雖是表示從那時起，車馬靠右行，但這聲鳴鳴長鳴，却似乎具有很深的含蓄，「解除警報」是顯示激烈，緊張，艱辛的抗戰時代已過去了，這是勝利的呼號，同時也是廣州迎接勝利年的第一聲。</p>
<p>鮮明的標幟　國旗在襟上飄揚</p>
<p>元旦日第一個使人注意的，便是國旗到處飄揚，它不單飄揚在天空，飄揚在中山紀念堂的頂端，飄揚在大街小巷，而且還飄揚在人們的衣襟上哩。它是一個鮮明的標幟，人們都爭着購買一面小　旗來掛在　上，也許你會間這究竟是什麼玩意兒？原來這是廣東各界慶祝三十五年元旦大會，擴大緊急救濟募　運動之其中一項售旗募捐，由全市各中學生組織售旗隊八十鰍在街上勸捐，取一枝旗隨你獻金多少，但人們嬝起確却是捐獻一百元。假如你樣上沒有那個「國旗通過證」，那就祇好請你留步，小朋友們會向你包圍。</p>
<p>吐八年鬱悶　六十萬人出街去</p>
<p>假如廣州有一百萬人的話，那末元旦至少有六十萬是在街上。八年了！他們不敢說想說的話，不敢做想做的事，到今天都可以大聲地笑，大聲的呌，難道逢到這樣的盛况，還不一洩八年所壓抑的鬱悶，還不盡情的舒展一下胸襟嗎？沒有一個人願意留在屋裏，大家都以異常興奮而歡快的心情，迎接這勝利後第一個元且佳日。人們擠呀，擠呀，街道上幾乎水洩不通，不時還有那些工會和國術館組織的舞獅隊，一隊一隊的經過，光怪陸離，五光十色，鑼鼓喧天，雄獅翻舞，吸引不少途人注目。獅子到處圍上了大堆人，途爲之塞，汽車的笛聲和手車伕們的么喝聲，他們都祗管看獅子而置之不理。這種喧鬧嘈雜的交響樂，襯托出街道上更形熱鬧。</p>
<p>車馬靠右行　童子軍全體動員</p>
<p>在這熙熙攘攘嘈雜的人羣裏，有時會有一小歐的童子軍走過，他（她）們眞使人喜愛，他們服裝整潔，精神充沛地用着輕快的步伐走着，他們不是閒逛，而是負責帮助維持交通的工作，因爲車馬靠右行開始的第一天，恐怕車馬行人們都未習慣，致紊亂了交通秩序，所以全市警察，靑年團團員，市黨部服務隊隊員和全市學生，都參加這督導工作，他們在細雨濛濛下，充份表現着他們的服務精神。</p>
<p>盛大展覽會　敵軍物品飽眼福</p>
<p>抗戰史蹟和戰利品展覽會也在元旦開幕，文德路的敎忠中學，比平時倍形熱鬧，它大量吞進好奇的人們。完全沒有經過砲火洗禮的人們，也可以去看看，使他們知道我國抗戰是何等的艱苦。會塲內分三部展覽，第一部門是繳獲敵軍的物品，有三十多種日本各式各類的步槍，輕重機槍也有十餘種之多，還有敵軍使用的通訊器材，大小無綫電機，電話　，　愛排，雙　搜搬蠶的會令　令教範日記文件，無一不是有價値的東西。敵軍的配當，也有條不紊的陳列着，如敵軍衣服，鞋，被褥，蚊帳，頭單，均甚齊備。還有手榴彈，工兵器材，砲兵觀測儀等，種類甚多，眞是琳瑯滿目，不一而足。</p>
<p>田中佩俘字　敵軍太表演技術</p>
<p>第二部門是重兵器和交通器材，凡日軍所用之各式大小砲流動發電機等，遍佈在廣場上，在禮堂的四週牆壁上，掛上四百餘幀極有價値的照片，其中最吸引人的，就是一張以前日本廿三軍司令官兼香港總督的田中久一的照片。照片上的田中久一是帽和徽軍，均已除下，繼了一條「俘」字的臂帶。這天　巧張司令官向華將軍也到場參觀，他看見了田中這張照片，他馬上命隨員將田中呈獻給他的佩劍也取了來，以增興味。第三部門是新一軍軍用動物崁演塲，裏面有軍犬，軍鰓，軍　等，這些本來是日軍所　練的，它們從前愛日語指揮，但為我軍俘獲之後再加酬練，現在已能聽　　語指揮了。當它們表演着各種技術時，在人羣裏可以聽到驚奇與飲佩的嘆息。</p>
<p>假若你不從任何熱閙地方去感覺今天是個佳日，那你可從報紙增刊上去看吧。一列列報紙擺在報攤上互相爭妍鬥麗，紅紅的封面，特大的紅字。大光報特別犧牲，一出五大張，仍賣五十元。「中山」及「中正」也不甘落後，都出了三張半，其餘也兩張半三張不等。而且在那條號稱「廣州望平街」的光復中路，中山日報社更紥上了彩，輝煌奪目，吸引了不少途人也抬頭望望。</p>
<p>提燈大巡行　鑼鼓喧天獅龍舞</p>
<p>在今天一天鰓　當中，表現將最有力，最精彩，最吸引人的，應該算提燈大巡行，巡行是下午六點鐘開始，參加的有黨政軍各機關，學校，民眾團體，和各商號，都派員紥作燈色，化裝，戲劇，舞龍，舞獅，人數達二萬人，長長的一行列，燈火輝煌，鑼鼓喧天。龐大的龍，與雄壯的獅子，各盡所能地飛舞，相映成趣。其中五十四軍參加的更別出心裁，他們以吉普軍紥成一條條巨大的活動魚，蟹，龜，和彩龍船，高蹺，化裝等，其餘各團體也有魚燈，油鷄燈之類，所經街道，萬頭攢動，情况之熱烈，眞是廣州八年來所僅見。</p>
<p>新的景象和喜悅沸騰的氣氛，充滿了整個新年，這昇平景象彷彿是一個戰勝國的國民應有的享受。不過從今日起，歷史的創造便開始了新的一頁，我們應該去創造前途燦斕光輝的奇蹟，使這昇平景象普遍到全世界每一個角落去吧。</p>
<h3>三千一百英里高空飛行　橫斷大西洋</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　朱家讓</p>
<p>由歐洲去美國，頂理想是坐到「皇后號」的大輪船，眞所謂物美價廉，穩快舒適，但適値戰後，美軍正在紛紛回鄕，艙位極有限，動輒要等二三月，而且我所持護照，據說很够坐飛機，因此英政府就把我列上飛的一起，並且關照我靜待佳音，說走就走，日子近得像在旦夕之間。可是事實上，我仍恭候了足足三個星期，才得從歐洲大陸脫身。</p>
<p>海空兩路　交通管制未撤廢</p>
<p>在這裏我想把英美最近交通情形略作叙述，或亦可供後來旅行者的一助。英美間目前海空兩路交通，大體還在政府管制下，但美國的汎美民航及美國海外航空公司，不久以前，已經自由載容，不受拘束。至於海運還須一律受英政府運輸部的統轄，沒有取得優先設，便買不到票，但取得了優先證，坐什麼船，亦只得碰運道。坐皇后船由美赴英易，由英赴美難。普通坐到小船亦就够苦，內部陳設不大堂皇，猶屬小事，而震盪緩慢，弄得坐立不安，而且一拖十來天，也眞是活受罪。尤其在冬季，北大西洋天氣惡劣，風浪過大，最近在聖誕節前，有幾艘輪船在大洋中猝遭風雪，幾乎險遇意外，有的折回修船，有一艘漂流了十八天才算安抵了美國。他們聖誕節的佳期，就這樣悻悻錯過了。空運方面，英美各有系統，英國主要爲海外航空公司，冬天通常走南路，係饒道葡萄牙，路綫長，日子久，價錢亦最貴，幾及美金八百元。北路由格拉斯哥直飛加拿大，路線較近，票價亦較便宜，然而講經濟，終猶不及美國民航機。美國的汎美客票，當我在倫敦時，赴紐約不過九十三鎊，合美金約三百七十二元，其中一度自動减價至六十五鎊，然因英國極力反對，仍回原數，惟因價廉，登記的人亦此英機爲擠。我此次曾向該公司特別商量，承允提前搭乘，但剛巧英政府的通知亦到了，爲了顧全「國際信義」，終於仍放棄了已到手的便宜貨。</p>
<p>飛蘇格蘭　當夜初渡大西洋</p>
<p>天是這樣陰沈沈，雨也在飄下來，我們一起三人，坐上一輛大客車，奔馳兩小時，才到機塲。地方是如此冷靜，除了壁爐的煤火還相當熊熊之外，加上心情上虛寂，我這叚旅行，要算最不自然。眼看雨越來越大，不知遙遠的前途何時始能到達。同行二人，一是英國科學研究的華盛頓分所主任，一是加拿大吐崙多的電影商，都還純正刻實，可以談談；而且這位電影商的太太，本是敎士之女，自幼生長在四川自流井，因此對中國亦有興趣，這樣就打發去了二個鐘頭，我們一起升上了空。</p>
<p>這叚航綫，先從倫敦飛往蘇格蘭的，格拉斯哥，這是英國第二大埠，與利物浦同爲重要港口，中華海員，亦多集中於此。在格拉斯哥，停留又二小時半，吃了頓蠻豐盛的夜飯，我們便要作橫越大西洋的壯舉了。</p>
<p>身心發抖　緊急時請君助我</p>
<p>細雨霏霏之下，戶外寒風澈骨，天氣不大好，地圖上顯示的默美兩洲，距離又是這麼長，一個無經騐的我，對於這回飛行，老貿說，有些擔心。加上啓程前半點鐘，照例要聽講，看演習，怎探帶養氣袋，怎樣着救生衣，更使我方寸不安，一似大禍將臨，我竟致跟那位英國博士本能地開了口：「如過緊急，請君助我！」事後思之，實覺可笑。</p>
<p>晚上九點鐘，自由式巨型機已　準備安當，我們一個個從　　壯子下鑽進坐位。依照那天氣候，必須　越雲層，在高空中飛行。果然不到一點鐘，　　　告：飛機已高達一萬七千尺，人人都須戴上養氣面具，以助呼吸了。氣溫最低時，至零下三十三度。雖然熱氣管齊放，身上再　三條絨毯，足登大棉鞋，還不藥軋軋發抖，摸摸身上的衣服，直如取自冰箱，大家的神情眞有些嚴肅，但是睡是睡不得，亦睡不着，機上的侍應生不時送咖啡，送蛋糕，只見大家儘在搖頭謝謝。</p>
<p>然而那天的飛行，確算成績很好的。事前，站上報吿，這位議師曾飛過百來次橫越大西洋的航程，看來經騐是相當老練，所以除了有一二叚短期的　　而外，竟都如履平地，比火車還穩。巨型機吼聲如雷，力大無比，在茫無邊際白浪滔天的大洋上，在風　險惡遙遠　渺的高空裏，始終健壯勇猛，一往無前，我以爲紐芬關總可歇歇脚了，那知轟隆轟隆，樂而不疲，結果，抵達蒙脫里爾（Ｍontrasal），才算降落。一查地圖計程三千一百四十一哩，竟然一氣呵成，我連大西洋一面未見，而今已登彼岸了。</p>
<p>節外生枝　巡視加拿大風光</p>
<p>加拿大與倫敦時間，約差五小時。我們飛越大西洋，不過十三飛行小時，應在翌日上午十時左右到達，但看看窗外，始終漆黑，原來還只五點鐘，旅行的鐘點，又多出來了。下得機來，大地已全被粉妝玉琢，雪還在不斷的加厚。初試北美寒風，多尖削而酷烈，耳朵馬上快要割下來，但一進室內，却是到處生春，和煦而可愛。</p>
<p>跑加拿大來，在我是節外生枝，原來並不想作什麼遊覽的。特別美洲比歐洲情形不同，歷史風物都說不上，却是市街齊整，建築亦學了美國的樣。摩天高樓，隨處皆是，這景象亦尙充滿新穎與進步。蒙脫里爾有一百多萬人口，是加拿大第一大城，屬魁北克省，爲一個富足而安靜的所在。那天，我們進市約在八點鐘，大雪下，郊外電車正在運軟乘客上辦公室，街上的人羣還是相當擁擠。由於歷史因緣，這裏的法國人要佔百分之六十左右，幾家大百貨公司，大商店，多由法商開設，商店都有法語店員，政府公文亦多英法語並用。以此不管程度怎樣，與歐洲相像，普通一個人都在說着兩種以上語言，以應付今日這個世界。</p>
<p>一般都說加拿大的生活，比美國低，因爲至少在貨幣上比較起來，就是一個九折。其他產品，也較相宜。經我試騐，確屬事實，但似亦未可一概而論。譬如皮鞋，還是美國廉，箭牌（Arrow）襯衫，紐約賣二元五，加拿大却値二元七。理一次髮，化去一元六。吃頓早飯，很容易超出一元。這標準，也不太公道了。加拿大與英國的關係，當然最密切，經濟自然，更通在一起，故這裏很多是英國貨，在英國本土無法買到，原來轍出到這裏來了。</p>
<h3>望家鄉淚沾裳</h3>
<p>記者因另有職務，留揚僅二日，曾偷閒前往「富春茶舖，」去一嘗名聞全國的維揚細點，千層油糕，翡翠燒賣，確有其特色。當地人民的「上午皮包水，下午水包皮」的優遊習慣，並不因警恐而改變，大約他們都覺到正氣能克邪焰，光明能驅黑暗吧？所惜時間忽促，不及放棹於瘦西湖：而今遙望平水堂及觀音山，爾增神往而已。記者特附錄蘇北流亡同鄕會的「流亡曲」於此：</p>
<p>「朔風起，寒霜降，黃葉　落，百草枯黃，忍饑耐寒，東飄西蕩，望家鄉，淚沾裳！」讀者乎！不知有何感慨耶？按上述一節乃全曲中之一段而已，觀此當可想像　揚各區苦難之深也。（之樑寄自揚州）</p>

<h3>科學進步對於戰爭觀念之改變</h3>
<p>— 趙曾玨</p>
<p>原子彈不斷在進步中，原子能</p>
<p>可以爲禍可以爲福</p>
<p>一九四五年不但是勝利年，抑且開闢了科學界新紀元的一年。美陸長史汀生於同年八月六日宣佈：『一九四五年七月十六日，新原子彈首次在美國新墨西哥試騐，並在雨中進行。炸彈在鋼塔中迅速氣化，濃烟衝入同溫層引起暴風，使二百五十空中里程的鬥窗震動，三英里外可以顯著的看見火光，在鋼塔一萬碼外竟有兩人被一種重力撞倒，俄頃有各色雲烟，直冲高空，達四萬英尺。……』從這一列的數目字，可以看出這種宇宙間基本力量的新武器，——原子的能——發揮這樣無上的威力。這樁事實，不但說明一種空前新武器的產生，抑且開了人類科學的新紀元。又美國陸軍戰略航空隊總部，八日發表：『超級堡壘一架。於八月五日至廣島投擲一枚原子彈結果，該城百分之六十被燬。』史巴茲將軍八月十日宜佈：『超級堡壘今日中午向長崎投下第二顆原子彈，此彈係屬改進式，易於製造，幷能產生更大之爆炸威力。此彈投於長崎工業中心，當原子彈投下十二小時內，長崎全市陷于火窟，烟霧蔽天，即在二百英里外之駕駛員，猶能見之。投彈之飛機師報吿，地下黑烟如噴泉之湧現，成爲傘狀之霧罩，達二萬英尺高度。幷據物理學者判斷，認爲此種黑烟，乃地下之日本三菱鋼鐵及兵工廠炸片所凝成。同時科學家根據此項觀察，聲明此第二原子彈出世後，第一種原子彈——投於廣島者——已成古董。」在這短短的幾句括，可以說明原子彈在不斷的演進之中。人類控制原子能的本領，在進步之中。今日較昨日爲精進。明日又較今日更爲精進。這種進步，較諸其他科學的進步爲速！爲禍爲福，就在看吾人對於運用原子能之不同。這是人類史的新階段。</p>
<p>二　攻重於守，工業重於軍隊</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰史中，英國的軍事史家傳勒將軍（Ｍajor　gen　Ｊ.Ｆ.Ｃ　Ｆiller）曾寫過：『上帝歸勝於量大的工業，不歸勝於最大的軍隊』。在這次第二次世界大戰，更證實了這句話。聯合國的勝利，不得不歸功於物質的優越，及美國加速度的大量生產。不但「質優」，並須「量多」。戰敗的德國，經聯合國家派專家前往考察，製造兵器，不是不優，奈產量不够。可知國防的先次條件，不但要有優越的科學研究本領，更要具備優越的大量生產條件，換言之，要有『質與量並重』的工業生產。在此次大戰中，最後的一幕，果然原子彈佔了上風，可是德國的飛彈，（火箭）亦是有威力的新武器。這兩種新兵器明白的指示我們，『攻重於守』。假使吾們能用原子彈先打擊敵人，同時大量毀滅其城池，吾人或即在數十小時，或數十分鐘內戰勝了敵人。吾人現在所知之火箭，不過最初步的，瞄準旣不正確，距程亦不够遠。但是科學很可能增進其準確性，與飛行距程，或可使火箭達到超越海軍。同時原子彈亦正在努力不斷的改進之中，可能改進到爆發時間的精確。更進一步的火箭上裝置原子彈很可能的對準敵人的重要城市萬弩前發，先下手爲强，在極短促的時間內，將敵人消滅，獲到勝利。美國的軍事研究家鮑爾溫（ＷansonBaldwin）曾想像將來如有大戰，恐怕要變成高度機械化的撳鈕戰爭，（Push　Button　War）即在千里之外，可以利用撳鈕放射火箭與原子彈，殺敵致果</p>
<p>三　飛機傳眞與雷達的地位，飛行員</p>
<p>與軍隊的地位</p>
<p>有人說，這次乃是最後一次用飛機駕駛員作戰。美國空軍總司令安諾德（Ｈ.Ｈ.Ａrnold）亦嘗有此言。蓋科學進步巳可使無綫電代替駕駛員而駕駛飛機，並得以傳眞電報，及電視，以及雷達，代替吾人之耳目。第二次大戰時飛機之偵察敵人陣地，係利用攝影，並可將機上所攝之影，在飛行空隙時，以傳眞方式傳達至後方。而雷達之運用，得完成超視棧之偵察，在數百里外之敵機，爲吾人目力所不及者，得投影於偵察器陰極綫管之幕上。如置雷達於飛機之上，則於飛越大洋之際，因雷達上超短波之放射與反射，得偵察數百里外海洋上之敵艦，而施以轟炸，眞所謂魑魅無所逃形，好像我國封神榜所說的「照妖鏡」！在此後戰爭中，飛機師雖可減少，以無綫電代替駕駛員，或利用遠距火箭，以代替飛機空襲，但飛行人員仍屬需要，以完成其他特殊之任務。優良的駕駛員，仍有其地位，因吾人尙未發明完全可以代替人類頭腦之機械！此外，地上軍隊之地位，亦値得吾人之注意。由於上述機械尙不能代替人類頭腦，及任何轟炸尙有其缺點，故地面上之軍隊，仍有其任務。因爲火箭，自動飛機，及原子彈，可以屠殺，消毀，及破壞地上任何事物，但消極性而非積極性的，能破壞而不能佔據，能威脅而不能組織。故將來空運部隊及傘兵仍屬需要。不過將來軍隊之訓練，恐須訓練地底作戰之特殊技能，此後吾人之防禦工作必在地下底層，孫子所謂「善戰者藏于九地之下」。但是在地底之下，能否確保安全，還是一個問題。</p>
<p>四　結論</p>
<p>綜上所述，科學的猛進，不但改變了此後的戰術，抑且改變了戰略。高山大河及地理上的陣碍，已失去軍事上的重大意義，海陸空軍隊已列爲第二層武力。同時亦改變了吾們建設都市的觀念。工業的建設必趨於疎散或深藏於地下。社會與經濟生活必有同樣的改革。凡此都因爲原子彈無上威力所迭成的新因素。但是也許因爲原子彈的威猛，而使世界得以維持和平，不致輕易發生反人道主義的戰爭。換言之，戰爭的威猛，或能促進人類道德的提高，科學殺人的慘烈，或能改進整個世界政治外交，使之漸入軌道，以避免人類自行燬滅的慘禍。同時科學家道德上的責任，要使偉大的原子能不但不爲害人類，且使能應用于工業爲人類造福！</p>

<h3>謠傳未見證實　金鈔均已回好　新港票買氣稍談</h3>
<p>烚赤昨由疲漸穩，證券方面獲利後之淤資，以及實力派稍有吸收，空方雖尙掙扎，中途頗爲恍惚，但午後仍吿向上，晨開本前日餘勢，自八二萬五後退至八一萬八，美鈔謠言未見證實，廠方吸納下，金市遂引起套買之流，漸漸拉上，證券帮游資稍來點綴，大勢乃告穩定，午刻在八三萬五左右盤旋，午後大戶補空，市况在平和狀能中趨榮，最後升至八五萬以上，結果較前收回好二二萬五，銀樓飾金掛九萬，紋銀七百元，銀元因國共停戰，江北帮銷路轉淡，退至四四五元左右，賭拆約七分至一角。缺乏變化。</p>
<p>美鈔以前日所傳謠言未能證實，但人心　感乏味，是以上塲時尚在前收低價盤旋，後以廠方略來吸納，漸漸回好至一四〇〇元外，金市漸形活躍，美鈔亦因套買關係，遙為呼應，午後更穩，結果較前收回好五十元，港票老貨呆滯若定，無人過問，結果雖較前日略好五元，但屬賣價，新貨上塲一度抬高至九〇元，然以廣帮供給三七年，傳明日有船來滬，買氣稍淡，降至八五以下，結果平平。</p>
<h3>公債熱跌冷漲　華股先疲後俏　游資又羣趨外股</h3>
<p>公債初時尙穩，惟業中人存多有限，對拉抬終嫌乏勁，是以丙種見一三五〇元高價後，卽吿下游，獲利之多頭亦乘勢出籠，另　雜牌，博取差額凈利，市况遂形熱門跌冷門漲之象，丙種最後在一三〇〇元關盤旋，而丁種反盤昇至一千元大關外，超過平時認　　門之戊種十餘元，午收給果較之前收計甲乙漲起一百元，丁種一百二十元，戊種七十五元，丙種獨無進展。</p>
<p>華股市况仍極混亂，散戶不乏乘機放空者，間有少數空額過多，臨收被迫軋空，以是中途雖疲，永紗跌至一一八〇元，美亞八六五元，新光七〇元內，景福五八元勤興五六元，惟是時外股形勢奇挺，華股受其影響，一般脫手洋股，覆進之下，疲後步穩，午刻空方亟補下，買氣死灰復燃，又告熾烈，午收遂都以高價收市，結果較前收計永紗漲起一百八十元，美亞七十五元，三小熱各漲七元至八元半不等，午後喊價續在扳高。</p>
<p>外股受銀錢業餘資及紗證兩帮獲利之盈餘所搜羅，一半有哄抬作用，散戶紛紛跟進，洋股凍結已久，籌碼本少，各股遂都扳高，會德豐一度站住萬元大關外殊久，鋼業在復工聲中以價小最受擁戴，結果再漲一成至二成不等，小型股及冷門更多買戶。</p>
<h3>米糧漲後回疲　油豆依然活躍</h3>
<p>米情北化轉懈，再居疲境，南粳早薄稻回跌五六百元，北粳亦小二百餘元，客秈杜秈均小二三百元，白元小二三百元，惟羊秈陰元貨稀尙挺，麵粉胃呆，價小二三百元，油市甬帮裝出，本街零化亦股，再漲二千元，黃豆亦然活躍，續升一二百元，豆餅續跌百元，酒價相仿，生仁依然牢立。</p>
<h3>人造絲續漲　綢廠前途黯淡</h3>
<p>人造絲週日漲風甚熾，昨市二〇號天橋開盤九十一萬元，收盤九十六萬元，下午續做九十六萬五千元，較上日又高六萬元，實銷需要甚股，無貨可供，以致蒸蒸日上，一百五十號已冲出百萬元大關，棧單希望渺茫，價與現貨距離日遠，同行互做七十三萬五千至七十四萬元，廠經榮辱互見，交易甚稀，綢市略高，美亞被而五十九萬五千元，大誠格子縐一千七百七十元，民生織錦緞九千五百元，據業中人云，綢市核計成本，不敷甚鉅，原料高漲無已，小型綢廠恐將不支，此後生產勢必減少。</p>
<h3>綠茶供不應求</h3>
<p>本市茶葉存底，目前均吿薄弱，尤以品質優良之炒靑及烘靑綠茶，幾有吿罄之勢，而邇來去化方面，天津帮殊呈活躍，因此咸以供不應求為憾，市勢遂益爲鋒利，行情昨又吿晋級，大有與日同增之概，其他花色，亦在實銷買戶納胃蟬聯下，市氣跟蹤稱堅，價格雖未吿扶搖直上，然一致隨市帶穩。</p>
<h3>紗市穩健如故</h3>
<p>昨紗市內地帮稍有採辦，棉織廠吸胃亦頗不弱，故廿支普通牌子及十六支紗價又升二萬之譜，特雙馬價殊平庸，仍做七十四五萬之間，細紗及雙綫因紡建公司源源供售，價較上日低三四萬，人心踟躕，頗有居高思危之概，蓋以物價指數而論，紗綫倍數較別種物價爲高也。</p>
<h3>煤塊平穩　小子煤銷路暢</h3>
<p>白煤篩塊仍在平穩中，白煤小子則銷路暢達，蓋白煤小子市價與篩塊相比，似較廉也，烟煤塊承前鋒芒，續呈堅俏，烟煤屑曾度喊高，但因廠銷呆平，受主見缺，終又回平。</p>
<h3>厚白鐵暢銷　水泥現貨甚俏</h3>
<p>平白鐵銷路又廣，尤以二十四號二十六號厚貨爲甚，蓋客帮採購，納胃極健，捆載而去者，不下千餘担，刻同業拆貨，每祖開八萬元許。</p>
<p>日來水泥廠家因燃料未有大量供給，出貨甚少，定貨百袋以上，便遲遲不能交貨，故現貨行情較前爲悄，現每袋沾四千五百元云。</p>
<h3>粤商要求修改　華僑匯率</h3>
<p>〔合眾社廣州十一日電〕此間商人要求修正華僑匯款至華之匯率，戰前匯款數字，年達數百萬美元之巨，目下所定匯率爲美金一元合法幣五百元，致使許多華僑反願匯款至香港，套換法幣，藉以避免照官價折算，蓋經香港一轉，即可多得法幣八百元，設由黑市套換，則可多得法幣一千三百元之多，廣州商人認爲設政府維持舊匯率，則失却獲得美金準備之大好機會云。</p>

<p>今日足球聯賽　猶太英海軍對壘　青白隊二度出師　相逢蘇聯於膠州公園</p>
<p>今日足球聯賽，計甲乙丙三組共有九塲角逐，均在膠園及虹口公國比賽，其中上午十時膠州公園之猶太對英海軍，猶太上週勝靑白，聲勢甚壯，英海軍爲集合各艦之精銳，實力自屬不差，故變方必有一番惡鬥。下午二時半青白二度出師，逢蘇聯隊，靑白上週第一戰不幸敗於猶太，蘇聯則亦已失敗一次，以情理言，靑白當可獲勝，且聞靑白高保正。費春華。李義臣三劍客決意助陣，陣容較上週爲整齊，勝蘇聯應無問題。茲錄今日秩序如下：猶太——英海軍（甲組）十時正膠園靑白——蘇聯（甲組）二時半膠園聯星——徐匯（丙二）十時正虹一茂雄——聖華（丙二）十時正虹二永安——蘇聯（乙駔）十時正虹三華光——博隊（丙二）一時半虹一萬國——廷光（丙一）一時半虹二龍傑——華安（乙組）三時正虹一永安——聶中丞（丙一）三時正虹二</p>

<h3>韓僑奮力作戰　昨竟和義僑隊　比數為一對一</h3>
<p>昨午足球聯賽，下午二時半在膠園有一塲甲組賽，義僑初次出馬，極受觀衆注意，以故球塲頗形熱鬧，比賽結果爲一對一，殊出人意料之外，上半時一比一，下半時未開紀錄，蓋韓僑之奮勇及拚力亦有足多者，義僑實因久疏練習之故，乃顯然有格格不入之勢，否則當可必勝韓僑也。</p>
<p>開賽後，韓僑奮勇作戰，義僑倉卒間有招架維艱之勢，十三分鐘時，韓僑得角球機會，由右翼洪聖郁主踢，落點甚好，宋興燮躍起一頂，麥尼蒂遲一步躍起，球乃應聲入網。義僑失球後，不能不加倍努力，未二分鐘，維拉右角打門，碰木柱彈回，泰克尼乘勢一脚，直竄網底，上半時一對一，未分勝負。下半時義僑進攻潮烈，無奈時運不濟，韓僑亦不放鬆，直至終塲，各無所得，一對一終局。</p>

<h3>八年來的唐山工學院</h3>
<p>— 瀟金</p>
<p>唐山工程學院是交通大學的一部門，戰前在北寧路上的唐山，開　煤礦的所在地，或許它只辦土木和礦冶二系的緣故，社會上一般的人對它很是陌生，可是在我國的鐵路公路以及其他國防工程的部門裏，却很出名。它創於前淸光緒卅一年，到今天已有四十一年了。在這悠長的歲月中，在忽視工程敎育的環境下，唐山工學院，始終含辛茹苦地造就了成千的人才，給古老的中國，新生了無數動脈！</p>
<p>這裏，僅是戰後八年來唐院經歷的報導，至於戰前的情形，為了篇幅的關係，而省略了。</p>
<p>開始內遷由滬轉湘</p>
<p>當抗戰的號角，從董溝橋響出後，唐山工學院便首先遇難，倉卒中什麼都沒有搶出，至上海，和總校相處了幾個月。然而抗戰的偉業，是長期的，在領袖的號召下，唐院便不顧一切地內遷。南京失守後一星期，經校友們的協助後，在湖南湘潭〔長沙南九十華里的小城〕，復了課。那時敎育部不發給經費，敎授全是義務，同學們亦忍受一切的困難和學校和衷共濟地渡着艱苦的難關。在茅以昇院長的領導下，在每月僅由校友捐贈六百元的情形下，唐山工學院於再生，終於又負起了抗戰所賦與的新使命，造育大量的工程人才，給祖國効勞，給抗戰開關活動的源泉。</p>
<p>長沙大火奔楊家灘</p>
<p>長沙大火，把唐院趕到了楊家灘。那是一個小村，這只是權宜的辦法。同時敵人的魔手緊逼着我們，因之，在廿七年冬，決定了西遷的計劃，目的地是昆明。全院師生，組了十多個單位，分批的跨上了西遷的征途，在桂林，又遭遇了敵機的狂炸，同學的行李，學校的儀器圖書，亦都損失，然而西遷的計劃，仍舊沒有放棄，師生們一步步的向昆明前進着　那時正是在實行「開發大西南的計劃，而貴州更成了大西南的中心，唐院在這時，正碰上了這千載難逢的機會，榮獲了貴州高等敎育引導者的任務，在貴陽東百餘公里的平越縣，停了下來。</p>
<p>開發西南進入平越</p>
<p>平越，是一個荒凉的山城，人口只有百來戶，而食物全賴外面的接濟，在這種環境下，唐院的師生，便默默地辛勤地開拓這原始的山城。經過六年多的耕耘，山城的面目改變了，初中高中相繼地成立起來，人民文化的水準提高了許多，一條小型的公路，曲折地在山叢中伸到了馬場坪〔貴陽東一百公里的大站〕和西南公路銜接起來。</p>
<p>在平越，唐院仍維持着二系的制度，這時在北平的交通大學鐵道管理學院，（和唐院共同自楊家難遷來），亦在平越，唐平二院成了一體，而敎育部亦把二院合併起來，改稱爲「交通大學貴州分校」，第一任校長是胡博淵先生。</p>
<p>儀器和圖書，是學校的第二生命，尤其是工程的，唐院赤手空拳的內遷，中途又受敵機的轟炸，可以說沒有一架儀器，沒有一本書，在抗戰的局面下，又不易向外面購取，於是發起了捐募運動，在校友的愛護下，獲得了很好的結果，同時學校亦設法購買了一部份，因之雖不及戰前的那麼完獎，但亦足够給學習上應用了。</p>
<p>卅三年十一月中旬，「湘桂」的保衛戰閃電般的結束，當敵人的鐵蹄已到了獨山時，唐院才倉忙停課。全體師生，只有丟行李驚惶失措地逃亡，在戰事節節失利，前後方亂成一片的局面下，唐院的師生把行李一丟再丟地跨上了五百公里的川黔路，從風雪的威脅下，校友的熱護中，到了重慶，五百多顆流離失所的心，暫時的安定下來。「一切爲抗戰」，「一切爲祖國」，這些苦痛，這些受難，算得甚麼呢！</p>
<p>在丁家坳找到校舍</p>
<p>當執敎三十多年的羅老敎授，自平越脫險抵達重慶後，校友會便開了一個歡迎會，同時亦商討復課的問題。經過一個多月的奔洽，校友們多方的協助，在重慶西一百公里成渝公路上的丁家坳鎭，找到了校舍。那是交通部交通技術人員訓練所的舊址，雖然沒有平越的校舍寬大，但亦勉强可用。然而八年來在平越的一切經營，却付之東流了，雖是後來運出了一部份儀器和圖書，可是總醫不了這巨大的創傷。</p>
<p>今日的唐院，仍是戰前的水準，敎授全是老的，三十年的二十年的多如牛毛，敎學的標準，仍是戰前的辦法。然而學生的人數，却增多了二倍，現在有四百多人。和它共患難的北平鐵道管理學院，亦同樣的維持着戰前的標準，在「交通大學貴州分校」的名稱下，本着四十年的傳統精神，給國家造育建國的人才。</p>
<p>末了，引用茅以昇博士在去年十二月十五日慶祝湘潭復校紀念會上的話，作本文的給束：</p>
<p>「我們唐院八年來的命運，是循環的。八年前，我們從山上（唐山）跌入潭裏（湘潭），又自潭裏爬到灘邊（楊家灘），從灘邊走上平地（平越），現在又走入了無水的坳（丁家坳）中，可是明年五月，我們又可回到我們的老家了。」</p>
<p>的確，唐山工學院亦係祖國一樣的復興了，今後唐院的發展，據顧宜孫校長說，是成爲一個完美的獨立學院，同時添一機電系，俾適合新生中國建設的需要。</p>

<h3>善後救濟署　拋售麵粉</h3>
<p>善後救濟總署，昨日忽採緊急步驟，以平抑本市麵粉市價，於上午由該署財務應派員至本市糧食公會，公開向市塲拋售美麥麵粉一萬包，標便每包三千七百元，並張有公吿一紙，原文曰：「本署現有二號美麥麵粉一萬包出售，每包價三千七百元，願購者請於本日下午二時前至仁記路阜豐福新兩廠辦事處，辦理手續，此佈。」據悉，該署自十一日開始辦理第四期發售麵粉，申請登記通續四日，廣泛配給大餅美餅攤之後，迄至昨日止，發出之申請書已達一萬五千份之多，一面辦理申請手續，一面開始調查，凡有營業執照，並具備担保者，立即由調查員當塲發給購粉證，名申請人即憑證於十七日發售時，付款出貨，因此本市市塲內之麵粉銷路，漸吿呆滯，市價原應暫時穩定，不致立即高漲，但此際青島·台灣·福州·漢口各外埠客帮，進胃轉濃，市價不但未見低落，反而較上星期高漲五六百元之譜，一號粉價竟超出四千元之關，故該署爲平抑粉價，遂於昨日斷然公開拋售。又悉？承購者必須於昨日下午二時以前辦理承購手續，過時則該公吿不受標價之約束，此種拋售，係無定期性。</p>
<h3>農次嚴愼予　赴錫視察</h3>
<p>農林部爲督促京滬一帶接收敵僞機權，迅速復業起見，派政務次長嚴愼予，來滬督導。嚴氏於四日由渝飛滬，連日視察農塲。牧塲。水產。蠶絲各機關，甚爲忙碌。並於九日召集漁業水產負責人座談會，十日舉行中國蠶絲公司董監事談話會，各項問題均已獲得吳體解決。聞該部在滬接收之農塲，已改組爲農林部上海實騐經濟農塲，並任張彬忱爲塲長，張繼志爲副塲長，上海魚市塲不日即可正式復業，選出總副經理，中華水產公司亦即依據行政院通過之章程，產生　監事，正式進行業務。中央病虫業械廠亦準備移滬，至該部與經濟部合辦之中國蠶絲公司，接收已畢，業由周董事長先聘葛敬中爲代理總經理，開始辦事，進行購崠蟲種，補充桑苗。嚴氏公畢後，昨晨偕皮特派員作瓊赴無錫，視察該部在錫之農具製造廠。不日赴京，轉道返渝。</p>

<p>繼由劉毓桂庭長審訊北京路豐泰銅錫號主張秉衡及夥友張益之兩人，張秉衡南京人，三十二歲，於黑階期內，藉收置銅元五金材料供給敵方而致當，遂納妾並於去年以二十根金條購進房產，度其優裕生活。勝利後，由警局檢舉，將張逮捕，移解法院，該案昨日並由黃浦分局司法股員到庭報吿承辦經過，但張辯稱並無與日商有往來。庭上即欲審查該店賬册，張諉稱，賬册由賬房保管，而賬房已往南京，地址不明，至此，庭長即諭候期再詢，被吿還押。</p>
<p>又訊，今日無審，明日又將有大批漢奸案開審，計上午九時審理凌光炎及薛有文等，下午二時宣判徐行及審理顧友棠，三時審理江友根左明等。</p>

<h3>淪陷期內不在業主　房地產請求發還</h3>
<p>本市前在淪陷偽組織時期，有偽上海市業主不在土地房屋管理會之組織，凡市民所有之土地房屋，未往該會登記者，概以不在業主論，均由偽會代管出租，當時一般隨政府內遷及若干思想純正之人民，不願前往登記，或因產證寄存在外，無從登記，致被其任意處分者，爲數頗夥，其間倚仗敵僞勢力，勾串佔用者，亦屬不少。據悉本市地政局接管是項案件，爲保障業主合法權益起見，已着手加以淸理，其辦法要點：（一）凡僞會代管出租之土地房屋，其原所有權人尙未收回產權者，應向地政局提出確切管業證件，聲請發還。（二）凡向僞會所租土地房屋之契約一律無效，原承租人應於一個月內提出憑證，向地政局申請辦理租賃手續，逾限即由局將該項租賃物收回，另行公吿召租。（三）承租契約，如原所有權人聲請發還，經核准後，即行撤銷，承租人應於兩個月內返還該項租賃物。事關各業主及賃租人切身權益，應分別聲請，以免延誤。</p>

<h3>北票棧盜竊存煤　內容複雜</h3>

<h3>運輸繁忙　兩路車輛缺乏</h3>
<p>京滬。滬杭兩路，自接收以來，客運十分擁擠，最近雖較改善，但行旅仍多向隅。記者特往調查，以現有車輛較戰前减少，而乘客反較戰前增多，戰前乘客每月約計一百三十餘萬人，現時約計一百九十餘萬人，較戰煎增百分之三十八强，而車輛戰前計有三百五十八輛，現僅有二百輛，較前减少百分之四十，即現有車輛需容納約較戰前一倍之旅客，其擁擠情形，可想而知。最近又因緊急運輸繁忙，車輛更不敷用，例如即日行駛京滬路之二三·二四次三等客車，及滬杭路之六一·六二次之三·四等車，因緊急運輸關係，不得不暫時停駛。各方咸望政府從速添備車輛，如向救濟總署請撥等，以利客運。</p>
<p>增設售票處</p>
<p>京滬·滬杭兩路，前因售蔡處設置太少，乘客購票未免擁擠，現該路局已在北站內，新增建售票房一處，該售票房，計有京滬線頭等售票窗口三處，二。三等各五處，滬杭線頭等一處，二·三等各二處。現北站與中國旅行社，共有售票窗口廿五處之多，各票窗一律於開車前三小時售票，旅客可不必心急購票。該站最近又將二等售票窗之設置數量，與三等售票窗相等，實因最近二等乘客日見增多，其人數不下於三等。</p>
<p>京滬車出軌</p>
<p>十一日上午十時，京滬鐵路貨車一列，於鎮江丹陽間之新豐站附近，因鐵軌縲旋釘被拆去而致出軌，機車並未損壞，損失輕微，旋經該路當局之搶修，於當日下午九時半，即恢復通車，現正多方偵查被拆原因。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕長江綫船舶，因差役關係，貨運阻滯，旅客尙能搭載，惟船隻殊感缺乏。至南北洋航綫，更覺無船。近有機帆船行駛，均由臨時船行代理，運量頗小，最大者僅二百噸。該項船隻，前係日海軍遝輸艦燬滅後，以此輔助運輸，今由招商局接收，共約二十餘艘，已分別出租，行駛福州泉州閩省沿海口岸及合灣靑島等處，營業甚佳。長江綫招商局下星期內，已定江華。江亞·國泰三輪駛漢，江渝輪駛宜昌，永和公司經理之風茂輪，定十五日直放漢口，大達公司大達輪，約今日自漢返滬，定下星期三四駛漢應差。該公司儲元輪，前在宜昌附近擱淺，已出險下水，亦將於今日到滬，入塢修理。三北公司永康輪修理工竣，定十五日開往漢口。靑島綫招商局現派海福機輪，定十六日駛靑，能否准期出口，尙難預料。滬港綫英輪，已有三艘行駛，岳州輪昨午起椗駛港，永生輪乘客有三百餘人之多，遲至下午三時出口，貴陽輪昨由港到滬，定下星期二駛港，聞預定客位已有四百位以上，定明日正式售粟。</p>
<p>民裕夫事原因</p>
<p>民生公司民裕輪，於煎日夜間撈出水面後，經查出沉沒原因，係由於船尾廚房前黑桿下約五英吋地方，有漏洞三個，三洞大小，一為二吋直徑，其他二個較小，為半吋直徑，船空時露出水面，不過六吋左右，貨一裝進，則即迫近水面，極易發生危險。至於責任方面，正由公司方面交涉中。</p>

<h3>訪問李石曾</h3>

<p>最後飛機離港出國</p>
<p>李先生是在七七盧溝橋三淞滬血戰時出國，環遊歐美兩大洲，首在法國巴黎出席國際文化合作大會，後又飛回當時中國作戰中心的武漢三　，太平洋戰爭爆發，李先生　居香港，日寇侵佔的兇燄，蔓延到天南，不得不脫離孤島，記得還是坐最後一架飛機，送往檀香山，在紐約勾留數月，與駐美大使胡適博士，宣傳中國種聖抗戰重大任務，乃爲維持世界和平而戰，爲主張國際公這而戰，頗得彼邦人士同情，先後以人力物力積極援助中國。因太平洋戰事關係世界整個戰局，覺有赴歐宣傳之必要，不辭跋，，自紐約出發到英國倫敦，鼓吹發動滇緬夾攻。</p>
<p>舊地重遊觀光巴黎</p>
<p>自聯合國開關第二戰綫，在法國諾曼第登路作戰，希特勒政權大受打擊，歐局形勢急轉直下，久戰沙塲勤勞復國的戴高樂將軍，終於凱旋重返法國的首都——巴黎。李先生這時正自倫敦飛向戰後復興的法國去觀光，這是他老先生舊遊之地，舊雨新知，歡然聚目，當然有說不出的愉快。據說自貝當放逐，賴伐爾處死，全國一致展開肅奸運動，惟戰後法國財政困難，需要美國協助甚多，法國人民對戴高樂印象極佳，認爲中與功臣。</p>
<p>刊行钜製世界學典</p>
<p>茲者世界兩大頑寇旣殲，反侵略工作已告一段落，李先生亦自歐美倦遊歸國，於上星期翩然蒞滬，繼續努力於文化事業之建設，第一件最大工作，莫過於刊行一部傑作「世界學典」，工程相當浩大，非一期一夕得覩厥成，他老先生具有堅强不拔的毅力，已計劃準備一切。</p>
<p>稚暉大學事業不朽</p>
<p>第二件工作，是發揚稚暉大學的不朽事業，敬老今年八十大慶，他的言論，他的人格，値得吾人欽佩，稚暉大學的細胞，不但分佈全國，世界各大都市如倫敦·紐約·巴黎·日內瓦布魯賽爾等處，所在都有。我國如國立北平研究院與本市著名的世界學院，都是敬老手創，目的是將以世界爲大學，以宇宙爲研究對象、萬派朝宗，而復歸於一。</p>

<h3>本市公用事業職工　紛起要求改善待遇　勞資雙方靜候各理調解</h3>

<h3>先檢查樹根</h3>
<p>— 史東山</p>
<p>常常看見有些戲劇界的老朋友在報端發表文章，說現在戲劇工作同志間的風氣如何如何不好，應該加以改善。文章並未舉出具體的事件來，驟然看起來，似乎也有道理。有一次，我偶然在一位朋友家裏碰到幾位劇團的負責人，也在談起這種所謂「風氣」問題，大家歷舉許多事件，互相訴說，都有悻悻之色，或作不勝浩歎之狀，一時話語相投，十分融洽，似乎找到了發洩的機會，不覺頓生相惜相憐之情。可是有人從旁把他們所舉的事件平心靜氣地加以分析，則又覺得其中固然有屬於個別同志的德性間題，但大都倒是由於領導人——他們自己——的德性與領導方法或者是社會環境所致。</p>
<p>任何事情，欲求改善，假如不從根本做起，偏在枝節上着眼，是不正確，也是不公允的，沒有用的。樹根敗壞，一定影響及於全身的枝葉，所以，假如發現有大多數枝葉發生病態的時候，我們最好先檢查一下樹根。羣衆是最好辦的，也是最難辦的。怎麼說呢？假如領導人能够嚴謹於自己德性與領導方法——誠懇坦白，大公無私，一切爲衆人着想，誠實爲衆人服務，說到做到，做不到的老實說明困難所在，不輕諾寡信，容忍別人的批評，虛心考慮別人的意見，不一意孤行，不稍使槍花，儘可能說服人，不强行命令，多探問人的痛苦困難，儘可能替他們解決……就憑這麼簡單的人人都會說的幾點，祇要你能做到，已經能够使衆人服你了。這樣，羣衆就可成爲最好辦的，否則。羣衆就可成爲最難辦的。同時，你必須有一個合理的制度來配合你那種好的德性，　就是說，不但要有好的「人」，還得要有好的「法」和「制度」才行。所謂好的法和制度，必定是能溝通縱橫，不是上下隔膜，不是左右各自爲政，而能互相關切，互相勉勵，互相督促，以收羣策羣力之功的。（不是我好學時髦，倒是必須民主的）這樣的團體沒有辦不好。團體之所以辦不好，依我們的經騐見聞所得，不外乎二端。一，卽所謂「上樑不正下樑歪」，羣衆見到事關根本，愛莫能助，又不好意思或無勇氣有組織的來一個「打倒」或「推翻」，於是起先不過在口頭上發發牢騷，而終於意志消沉，無形怠工，粗暴者不免意氣用事，以致於大家「橫竪橫，拆牛棚」。二，是由於縱橫不溝通，（做法不民主），以致引起很多誤會，發生許多糾紛，而至於亂，終至於垮。</p>
<p>我總覺得壞的份子是比較少的，所以一個團體，祇要領導人領導有方，同時制度定得合理，法立得切實精到，而又能作公正合理的活用，這樣的團體，沒有辦不好的。假如說壞的份子最足以影響團體，出寗說好的制度和好的法一定會使群眾趨向於好，祇要領導人有這種見地和氣度，敢於開放民主。</p>
<h3>孤島回春</h3>
<p>— 徐心芹</p>
<p>——為前後方藝人獻詞　辛苦八年餘傲骨，撐持孤島未窮途，國門今日春如海，多少藝人入幕無。</p>
<p>在後方欣賞抗戰期間藝人們的劇影工作，我的腦海裹雖然僅僅只記下了一些斷續的劇名片名。但我覺得意義非常深刻，比如我最初看見「中華兒女」，其次是「蛻變」，其次是參觀拍攝「長空萬里」，又見到舞台上的「塞上風　」，諷刺劇「羣魔亂舞」攝着是「鳳凰城」，「民族萬歲」，「國家至上」。「氣壯山河」，一直到「血濺櫻花」後又「還我故鄕」。而我對「孤島天堂」，前程萬里」，「白雲故鄉」，「刑」，「霧重慶」「妙峯山」更特別記得。至於「長夜行」，「離離草」，「一年間」，「風雪夜歸人」，一直到最近的「淸明前後」，「芳草天涯」。爲了這些作品，使我對藝人們是異常親切。那時從上海傳到後方去的劇影作品，我除欣賞以外也曾經把僅能得到的說明書劇評等前貼在一本「劇運集錦」大手册上，以備將來碰到這些友人時，　出來作爲談助。我記得在將要勝利時到昆明的劇人們似乎都曾看見過了。</p>
<p>年蟄處，今日又重到上海，戲影界的舊雨新知，大槪在一月以內都漸漸　逅不少了，可惜的是因爲工作和私事關係，還沒有一一暢談積愫。但我在這大地春回之際，是得到了天時和人爲的兩軍漚暖！</p>
<p>藝人們無　在後方或在孤島，人家彷彿都不犬得意吧？大家都喜歡說：「劇影界似乎沒有　暖？」　則以爲，可是工作者當常以　暖給了觀衆。如同工程師與土木工人並不都爲自已造住宅。所以「爲誰辛苦爲誰忙？」凡欣賞的觀衆們他們都會知道的！而且最直接給工作者的安慰的恐怕也是那熱烈而永恒記憶着　們的羣衆吧！</p>
<p>工作者不必悲哀，在這時候更要打起精神，為國家勝利的春，「來吾導乎先路」。因為劇影工作才是文化的急先鋒，尤其請您們面向欣賞的羣衆！羣衆們正在向您們歡呼！盼望您們再給他們大量的　暖！</p>
<h3>美國務院體聘　曹禺老舍講學</h3>
<p>據司靠消息，美國國務院近決定聘請中國戲劇界巨子，曹禺（萬家賣）與老舍（舒舍予）二氏赴美講學，聞二氏已接受聘約，將於最近期內準備出國云。（劇影社）</p>
<h3>「鷹獅」來滬　爭取英片市場</h3>
<p>自德國敗降，歐戰結束而後，英國方面，正和好萊塢相同，一般製片廠，對於攝製工作，積極進行。預料不久將有大量新片，運往海外公映，和美片爭一日之長、而對於上海的西片市場，亦很重視。</p>
<p>由渝來滬　鷹獅電影公司是英國各大製片廠的一個聯合組織，專司分配影片放映之職。最近該公司駐華代表湯姆倍克，已率同若千職員，由重慶來滬。並於黃浦灘畔租一大厦，正式辦公，開始與海上各電影院接洽英片放映問題。</p>
<p>與美合作　由英國各廠攝制的一九四六年新片，一部分早已運到中國，另一部分在首途中。鷹獅公司的組織，規模很大，除分配出品外，更代表英國各製片廠，對外協商一切。據云該公司所屬各廠，已和美國的米高梅，派拉蒙及其他各大製片廠訂有交換演員及導演的友好條件。在抗戰後期，鷹獅公司會將若干英片，介紹於重慶觀衆，獲得不少好評，而到了現在，目光將注視到上海了。</p>
<p>蕭翁名著　湯姆倍克曾向新聞界表示，渠相信今後英國片在滬公映，一定可獲得相當地位。因戰後英國各廠，所攝新片，類多偉鉅。如蕭伯納之名著「凱撒與克利奧伯拉」Ｃcesar　and　Ｃleopatra　一片，由克勞特雷恩及費文麗合演者，正在英國作世界初映。倫敦人士，譽爲佳作。實際上也的確是一九四五年度英國最偉大的鉅片。不久就可運往世界各地公映了。</p>
<p>攝製鉅片　同時，最近獲選爲好萊塢一九四五年度的最佳演員英格麗褒格曼已預定主演柴紐克監製，鷹獅公司發行的歷史鉅片「曼麗瑪格泰妮」Mary　Magdalene　　一切工作，都在積極進行。此片攝製成本，預定爲美金四百萬元，美國報紙，已在先爲介紹。將爲英國片中超特的出品。</p>
<p>映片計劃　倍克更表示在未來的一年——一九四六年——中，預定在上海至少公映英國各廠所製的新片二十四部，平均每月兩部。而所有放映的影片，無論本質，內容取材，演員陣容及導演人選等，都將擇其最佳者。這樣在上海一地，未來的英片市場，才可很有效的奠定一個基礎。</p>
<h3>英影業巨頭　赴影城選美女</h3>
<p>英國影業巨頭阿連氏，深感英國美女之不易覓得，本月初乃不能不光顧舉世聞名，美女衆多之荷萊塢，以選拔眞才。阿氏向劇影社記者謂：英國電影明星原非醜陋，但言動過於檢束，缺乏性美表現，與荷萊塢之佳麗相較，則十分遜色，阿氏此行，十分順利，已得茵格列，十曼女士及鍾芳亭女士之諾的，擔任兩片主角，同時且與美國製片商約定，隨時交換明星辦法。阿氏復稱：英國不止缺乏表演性美之影片，且此類之劇作家，亦殊罕少。此輩劇作家多長住鄕間，與城市少有往來，在象牙之塔寫作，不及美國劇作家之富有活力，故關於愛情及性美之作品，將來還須取材於美國云，〔劇影社美國通訊〕</p>

<h3>「夢想女郎」</h3>
<p>— 王申</p>
<p>「夢想女郎」一片，由愛爾受·拉埃斯自編自導，此外，他還賠出　的太太培丹·菲爾特來擔任女主角，結果攝成了一個輕鬢活潑的戲劇，出錢去看戲的影迷們，決不會呌寃枉。</p>
<p>幕啓時，芳齡廿三的喬奇娜·奧勒頓，佯裝一個老處女。她自以爲和她的舅兄相愛戀。喬奇娜開一爿書舖，她的尊兄也是印刷界中人。後來，她遇到了一個對她頗為垂靑的書報掮客，這位先生人倒很活潑，但是念頭不大光明。再後來又遇到了一位可以不讀書本原文，而會信口雌黃大寫其評論的文藝批評家。</p>

<h3>提倡兒童劇</h3>
<p>— 王槐德</p>
<p>在不久以前，當局曾有不准九歲以下的兒童進久戲塲或影院的某令，於是在一張日報上，我看見一篇文字，大意是說當局這種措置尙有商榷的餘地。對於這件事，我的見解與那篇文字的作者不同，我覺得上海目下的一般戲院所演的戲都是不適合兒童們看的，當局的辦法是因爲怕兒童幼穉的心靈，爲那些「成人戲」所影響，而造成未來的惡果，無疑地是具有很大的意義的。</p>
<p>我想，與其禁止兒童看「成人戲」，爲何不提倡專爲兒童而演出的戲，給他們觀賞？不消說，這在歐美各國早有極好的例子在。但國外的事太遼遠了，我不想一一說出，單盒現在上海俄僑總會中的兒童歌劇的演出來說，的確可爲我們效法。</p>
<p>筆者曾因友人之邀，到俄僑總會去觀光了一次兒童歌劇。所謂歌劇者，其中的演員全由小孩子祖任而成人只有幾個扮不關緊要的角色出現。所演的劇情，因爲筆者不諳俄語，常然不知道講的什麼，一點不了然；但據情節准測起來，大抵不外乎是含有敎育性的吧。許多天眞爛漫的俄國小孩，在台上有時舞蹈，有時唱歌，也有對話，也有表情；雖然不免幼稚，但好在對象都是孩子，如果一不小心鬧出笑話來了，也不打緊，項多惹個滿堂大笑，一般小觀衆看得更加有趣。他們——小觀衆都是隨同父母前來，不時要向父母問東問西，而父母也不厭其詳爲他們解釋：這種情形求諸於中國的父母却是難得。</p>
<p>我們希望有專爲兒童設立的戲院，由兒童們自己演出的戲劇出現。使孩子們有自已的戲院，看自己的戲。</p>
<p>編者按：在抗戰期間，政治部曾將流離失所，無家可歸的孩子們，組織了一個孩子劇團，各戲劇家凌鶴先生曾一度祖任該團團長，一羣天眞爛漫的孩子，一面學習，一面演劇，頗爲社會人士所讚賞，現在，該團的小團員們，多半已經是少男少女了，有的繼續學習，有的參加了職業的或業餘的劇團。</p>
<h3>上海劇校解散</h3>
<p>創辦已有七年的上海戲劇學校，前數日正式宣吿解散，經濟困難是最大的原因，戲校造就的人材不少，以後將要以自立的姿態在舞台上與觀衆相見，尙有許多未到畢業時期的同學，只好中途退出，另謀造就。這是一個很不幸的消息。</p>

<h3>「龍子」</h3>
<p>— 萊明</p>
<p>這是美國賽珍珠女士，繼「大地」後之又一新傑作，當本書出版後；米高梅影片公司，立即選擇了絕技的導演，及適合演技的演員，來攝制該片；在本片中，描寫出在這次戰爭中，中國被淪陷區的人民，對日帝國主義的反抗史，及風俗·習慣·戲情極爲婉轉動人，可歌可泣。</p>
<p>此片由二大導演，賈克康韋與皮斯寇脫，並肩擔任，手法都畢竟不同凡響，至於演員，當然苜推凱塞林赫本，她是個東山再起的影人，在扮演玉的一角，充分發揮了她的演技，在本片中，她有唱中國小調的鏡頭，極有中國之風味，還有一幕玉在鄕村中，準備毒死許多日倭的一刹那，演得非常緊張，最後她同她的丈夫老二，領導一羣鄉民，燬滅園地時，烈熖衝天的火燒塲面，尤屬驚心動魄，非常偉大，此外，導演應用雄壯的歌曲，作爲音樂的背景，再加上了全部中文對白，更使我國觀衆，格外適合明瞭，所以這眞是一張道地的舶來中國片呢！</p>
<p>新進明星杜渶貝（阿利巴巴四十大盜主角之一）的扮演老二，影壇老手華爾德許士頓的林丹，及麥克墨洪的林妻，演出都具有珠聯璧合之佳，本片的哄動，駕於當年「大地」之前，故爲我國人士値得一看之影片。</p>

<h3>The Third Meeting of the Consultative Conference Presumes Eight Members of the Inspection Team; Wang Yunwu, et al., Form a Group of Five</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th] The Political Consultative Conference held its third meeting this morning in the National Government Auditorium. Thirty-five representatives attended, including Sun Ke, Chen Bufu, Wu Tiecheng, and Zhou Enlai. Zhang Lan requested leave due to illness, and Chairman Jiang designated Member Sun Ke as chairman. First, Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), reported on the consultations regarding the summary of the talks between the government and the CCP, stating that he believed the consultations on the summary had a fundamental success because the general policy of peaceful nation-building had been decided upon, and many agreements had been reached on specific issues. For example, the second item of the summary of the talks concerned the decision to convene a political consultative conference, as well as matters such as the fundamental freedoms and rights of the people, and local autonomy. The nationalization of the military was also [agreed upon]. Zhou reiterated several points: (1) The CCP's belief in implementing the Three Principles of the People continues to strive for its realization and has not been interrupted by conflict. (2) They acknowledge Chairman Jiang's leadership position and remain steadfast. (3) They respect the Kuomintang's position as the largest party. (4) Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, they have recognized the National Government and have never attempted to disobey or overthrow it. This can be seen from the fact that there is no central government in the CCP-controlled areas. Shao Lizi, representing the government, reported that both sides had been sincere in their consultations from beginning to end and had made mutual concessions, but there were also areas where concessions could not be made because the representatives of both sides had their own positions. For example, in item 9 of the summary, the provision for the CCP's army to be reorganized into twenty divisions involved significant concessions from both sides. Shao also mentioned the efforts of Minister Zhang Zhizhong and Ambassador Hurley in the talks, which should not be forgotten. After Shao's report, the entire body unanimously passed the reports of Members Zhang Qun and Zhou Enlai from yesterday. A recess was then called, and government representative Chen Lifu, CCP representative [Mao] Biwu, Democratic League representative Liang Shuming, Youth Party representative Chen Qitian, and independent representative Wang Yunwu negotiated during the recess to nominate candidates for the military inspection team. After the recess, a report was presented, nominating He Jihong, Li Dequan, Lin Keji, Zhou Binglin, Wu Baozhen, Du Bincheng, Zhang Yuanshan, and He Guanqi as members of the team. Leng Shi, Zhang Xizhu, Ren Hongjian, and Lin Hu were nominated as alternates. Shao Congen, Yu Jiaju, Deng Xianchao, Chuan Sinian, and others spoke on the reports of the government and CCP representatives, all hoping to establish a permanent foundation for peaceful nation-building. Ye Jianying bid farewell to the representatives, saying that he would be going to Peiping soon to participate in the work of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters and hoped to receive guidance. Lu Dingyi proposed the formation of a group of five, and this proposal was unanimously agreed upon, namely to elect representatives from the nominated inspection team to form the group, and to negotiate tomorrow morning. Tomorrow is Sunday, a recess. All parties can conduct off-site consultations. The fourth meeting will resume at 3:00 PM the day after tomorrow (the 14th). (The reports of Zhou Enlai and Shao Lizi will be continued in tomorrow's third edition.)</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th] The General Assembly will adjourn on the 13th and presume Wang Yunwu, Chen Qitian, [Mao] Biwu, Chen Lifu, and Liang Shuming. A group of five was formed to negotiate the agenda for the General Assembly on the afternoon of the 14th. The original budget for this General Assembly was 15 million yuan. It will probably not exceed that.</p>
<h3>The Government Will Accommodate All Parties; Military Conflict Will Cease Starting at Midnight Tonight; The Communist Army Will Be Reorganized and Reduced to Twenty Divisions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 12th] Private sources say that the most likely cause of difficulty for the Consultative Conference is the election of a National Assembly and the reorganization of the government according to the proposals of the various parties. These issues are currently being discussed behind the scenes. A third possible cause of difficulty is the nationalization of the army. Formal discussion on this issue has not yet begun. The Democratic League has put forward three suggestions, namely, the separation of the army from the National Government, the reduction of the number of troops, and the formation of a committee composed of military and civilian representatives and American personnel to draw up detailed measures for the first two tasks. After the Political Consultative Conference closes on January 23, the government authorities will immediately take steps to reorganize the government and allow leaders of all parties, especially the Communist Party, to join the National Government Committee. This is the country's highest policy, and a new institution will be established to replace the wartime institution of the Supreme National Defense Council. The government will quickly re-appoint ministers of various ministries, whose sole purpose is to accommodate leaders of all parties, especially the Communist Party. The vice-chairmen and vice-mayors of provincial and municipal governments will also be rapidly appointed by the government. These positions can be held by Communist Party members and democrats. In some areas, the provincial chairman and mayor can be appointed by the Communist Party so that the Communist Party can simultaneously occupy a position in the central and local governments.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Zhou Enlai revealed that the third meeting of the Political Consultative Conference agreed to form an inspection team composed of five political parties to investigate the truth in the conflict areas, so the two sides agreed to cease military conflict starting at midnight tomorrow. He went on to say that before the nationalization of the army is realized, the Communist army will begin to be reorganized and reduced to twenty divisions according to the plan of the Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] At the third meeting of the Political Consultative Conference on the 12th, the following resolution was made regarding the report of government representative Zhang Qun and CCP representative Zhou Enlai at the second meeting on the 11th regarding the negotiations on the cessation of military conflict and the resumption of transportation: "The members of this meeting, after listening to the report of Mr. Zhang Yuejun and Mr. Zhou Enlai on the negotiations on the cessation of military conflict and the resumption of transportation, are fully aware that both the government and the CCP are making the greatest determination to be patient and accommodating, so that military conflict will end and peace will be established. We are deeply gratified. We especially hope that following this agreement, measures to permanently eliminate military conflict will be implemented quickly. At the same time, we would like to express our deep admiration for General Marshall's enthusiastic support."</p>
<h3>Robinson Goes to Peiping to Establish Executive Headquarters</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 11th] According to reliable sources today, Robinson, the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in China, and two other members responsible for implementing the order to mediate the cessation of conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, flew to Peiping today to supervise the establishment of the Executive Headquarters and will begin work in Peiping. Zhou Enlai told reporters that each member has about 300 staff members. Colonel Barruder, Military Attaché of the U.S. Embassy in China, left Chongqing for Peiping today to prepare for the establishment of the basic affairs of the Executive Headquarters. Mr. Barruder may preside over the military command section of the headquarters. He came to Chongqing with Marshal Ma.</p>
<h3>The Peiping Pacification Headquarters' Organization May Expand</h3>
<p>Merchants Hoarding Goods in Peiping and Tianjin are Strictly Investigated</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 11th] Li Zongren, Director of the Pacification Headquarters, said: The list of Chinese traitors in North China will be announced as soon as the arrests are completed. After a thorough investigation and inspection, they will be transferred to the court for trial. Currently, prices in Peiping and Tianjin are rising daily. In terms of treating the symptoms, the government has strictly investigated merchants hoarding goods and speculation. In the future, it will also explain the sources of materials to fundamentally solve the problem. He did not explain the existence or abolition of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, but as reporters know, the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters in all war zones will be abolished in the short term. In the future, the Peiping Pacification Headquarters may be expanded, with Sun Lianzhong and Fu Zuoyi as deputy directors.</p>
<h3>Yu Hanmou Returns to Guangdong; Xue Yue Arrives in Chongqing to Report on His Work</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] Yu Hanmou, the newly appointed Director of the Quzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office, came to Chongqing on the 8th to report on his work. He visited Chairman Jiang on the 10th to ask for instructions. He will fly to Guangzhou and then Shaoguan within days to handle the closing work of the Seventh War Zone, which can be completed by the end of this month. All defenses will be taken over by the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters. Yu will take office in Quzhou in mid-February. It is reported that the Quzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office has jurisdiction over the two provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian, as well as parts of southern Anhui and eastern Jiangxi. There are one to four deputy directors. Those who have been appointed are Li Hanhun, Jiang Guangnai, and Li Da. It is also reported that Xue Yue, Deputy Director of the Wuhan Pacification Headquarters, arrived in Chongqing on the 11th to report on his work.</p>
<h3>Sun Yat-sen's Relics Found; Handed Over to Madam Sun for Safekeeping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The original manuscript of Sun Yat-sen's "Sun Wenxue Shuo" and other valuable relics that were stolen by the enemy puppets some time ago have recently been found in Nanjing by Mayor Ma Chaojun and have been returned to Madam Sun for safekeeping. Although the relics have been [gone] for many years, they are still in good condition.</p>
<h3>Kuala Lumpur Incident Resolved</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuala Lumpur, 11th] The unfortunate conflict between British police and our liaison officer on January 3 has been resolved a few days ago. According to official sources, the incident was due to the mistaken identity of the Chinese liaison officer as an officer of the Anti-Japanese Army. The British police officer believed that the Anti-Japanese Army had been disbanded, so they should no longer wear military uniforms or carry weapons, and they did not know that there were also Chinese officers in Malaya. For this reason, the military funeral of Colonel Lin Mousheng will be held in Singapore on the 13th, so they are eager to reconcile so that there will be no regrets. In order to avoid causing unnecessary stimulation to the general public, it has been agreed that the details of the resolution of this incident will not be published.</p>
<h3>Grain-Paying Farmers in Southern Anhui Petition to Shorten Delivery Route</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Due to the tight deadlines set by various counties for the allocation and purchase of military grain in southern Anhui, farmers are paying quickly, but the Ministry is unable to count it in time, resulting in mountains of rice piling up on the riverside in Wuhu. The farmers paying the grain are stranded on the Jianggan River, some waiting for as long as ten days, causing great suffering. Yesterday, representatives from Huaining and six other counties came to Nanjing again to request a reduction in the allocation and a shortening of the grain delivery route. It is reported that after receiving the report, the Executive Yuan has ordered the Ministry of Food to send capable personnel to Anhui to quickly count the grain in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<h3>Public Servants in Guangdong and Guangxi Forbidden to Give Gifts for Weddings and Funerals</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 11th] In order to change social extravagance and eradicate corruption, Director Zhang of the Pacification Headquarters has ordered all party, government, military, and public servants in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces under the jurisdiction of the Pacification Headquarters not to hold banquets in tea houses and restaurants, and to prohibit giving gifts to each other for weddings, funerals, and celebrations, effective immediately. In addition, dancing has been banned here a month ago. The College of Arts of Sun Yat-sen University is scheduled to resume classes on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Special Envoy Marshall Visited Chairman Jiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] Special Envoy Marshall went to the U.S. Embassy on Liangfuyun Road on the morning of the 12th for an informal meeting with some staff members. At 2:30 PM, Mr. Marshall visited Chairman Jiang.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Minister Zhang Zhizhong hosted a banquet for the representatives of the CCP attending the Political Consultative Conference at Guiguo Restaurant at 6:30 PM on the evening of the 12th. Seven CCP representatives attended, as well as government representatives Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, and Shao Lizi.</p>
<h3>A Large Area of Conflict; Zhou Enlai Reports at the Request of Zeng Qi</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 11th] (Delayed) The second meeting was held at 3:00 PM on the 11th. Zhang Qun and Zhou Enlai reported on the cessation of hostilities and the resumption of transportation. Zeng Qi asked Zhou Enlai to explain the current conflict areas in order to check the implementation of the ceasefire order. Zhou Enlai stood up and explained that, according to materials from three days ago, the conflict spread to thirteen provinces and regions: Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Zhejiang. The most intense conflicts are currently near Chaoyang in Rehe, north of Nankou, and near Gubeikou. In Shanxi Province, it is near Datong and in the southern section of the Tongpu Railway. In Shandong, it is in the suburbs of Jinan and on the Jiaoji Railway. Other areas include northern and eastern Henan, northern Jiangsu, eastern Zhejiang, the border between Hubei and Henan, the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, along the Yuehan and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railways, and Hainan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 11th] (Delayed) During the discussion of the agenda of the General Assembly, Liang Shuming proposed that it should include matters related to the ceasefire, how the summary of the talks between the two parties should be implemented, relief and rehabilitation, a common program of governance, open government, nationalization of the army, and the National Assembly of the Constitution, but it was not passed. The Secretariat also scheduled the origin of the summary of talks on the 12th and presumed the military inspection delegates.</p>
<h3>Six Hours After the Ceasefire Order Was Issued, There Was No Gunfire in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan; Bai Chongxi Left Bengbu for the Jinpu Railway to Inspect</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Deputy Chief of Staff Bai left Bengbu yesterday to inspect the Jinpu Railway line. Six hours after the General Headquarters of the Army issued the ceasefire order, no gunfire was heard in the positions of the National Army in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan. This is because the combat actions taken by the National Army in the past to complete the two major tasks of accepting surrender and protecting the return of refugees were mostly defensive, and their posture was defensive from beginning to end. In addition, the National Army has a more dense communication network, so once the ceasefire order is issued, it is implemented immediately. It is reported that the Communist Army southwest of Peiping was still taking action as of 10:00 PM today. The National Army is abiding by the order of the Commander-in-Chief with great patience. Also, at Dengjiatun, 50 li from Caozhou in western Shandong, a team of Communist troops surrendered to the National Army's Zhang Division with their weapons yesterday. The National Army had just received the ceasefire order and shook hands with the surrendered Communist officers and soldiers, posting a paper as a good news of the first handshake between the Kuomintang and Communist armies after the ceasefire order was announced.</p>
<p>Li Zongren's Speech</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 11th] Director Li Zongren met with reporters from this newspaper at 9:00 AM this morning and said: I read in the newspaper that the order to cease conflict has been issued, but the official order has not been received. I will obey the order and handle it. To be honest, China's own problems should be solved by ourselves. It is really embarrassing that the United States has to come out and mediate! The following are Director Li's answers to reporters' questions. Question: Where are the current conflicts? Answer: The National Army in North China is still deploying and has not moved. The current situation is that the Communist Army is destroying railways and the National Army is covering the repair of the road. Question: Where is the railway destruction the most severe? Answer: The Peiping-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, and Peiping-Suiyuan Railways are all severely damaged. Question: The ceasefire order does not seem to include Rehe and the nine northeastern provinces, does it? Answer: That's right! Rehe is not considered part of the nine northeastern provinces. Question: So, are General Du and Chairman Liu's military and political advances restricted by this order? Director Li did not explain this question because the military affairs of Rehe are now under the command of the Northeast Pacification Headquarters. Question: When can the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters be established in Peiping, and what are the candidates? Answer: I don't know.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tianjin, 12th] The order for the Kuomintang and Communist parties to cease conflict has been widely spread throughout North China today and is widely welcomed. It is generally believed that this is a turning point in the overall situation in China. However, some parties still have doubts and believe that the characteristics of the order will be seen when the National Army attempts to enter Zhangjiakou. According to the ceasefire agreement, the National Army can enter the Northeast to establish Chinese sovereignty. These troops can travel north of the Great Wall to Zhangjiakou. It is rumored that some troops are already on the way. It can be asserted that a large number of troops will travel to the Northeast in the future.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 12th] After the issuance of the ceasefire order between the Chinese government and the Communist Party, military affairs in North China have actually come to a standstill. The Communist army, which had been moving towards Zhangjiakou for the past few days, has recently turned back to Shandong, but it is said that the Communist army is intensifying its activities there.</p>
<h3>Chuan Sinian Shouts "Unacceptable"; Liang Shuming Storms Out</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 11th] (Delayed) (1) Lei Zhen reported that as of noon today, only two proposals have been received from the Youth Party. Chuan Sinian shouted, "This is too disappointing for journalists. The parties have plans, but they are not taking them out early, which is really unacceptable." (2) The demand for the audience is still endless. The person in charge said that today they realized that the reporters stationed in Chongqing from the newspapers outside the area also came flying from the sky and drilling from the ground. (3) At 5:30 PM, the national flag was lowered at the National Government, and when the national anthem was heard, the audience stood up, but unevenly. (4) Chuan Sinian said that discussing the agenda without seeing the proposal is like choosing a bride before having a son. (5) The Democratic League proposed eight agenda items, while Zhou Enlai still adhered to the two principles of the peaceful nation-building plan and matters related to the convening of the National Assembly. (6) Liang Shuming spoke the most times today and had a verbal battle with Zeng Qi. Zeng Qi was polite, but Liang was impulsive and stormed out of the venue many times. (7) When Zhang Yuejun and Zhou Enlai reported, the hall was filled with the sound of papers colliding. (8) Seeing that there was disagreement on the Yi Cheng, Wang Yunwu wrote to each party to inquire about their opinions, and then claimed to have a small consultation, advocating discussing military affairs, politics, the National Assembly [draft] constitution, and other five items, but there was no small result.

<h3>Zhou Enlai's Report at the Second Meeting: Lessons Learned from Experience - Three Principles for Unconditional, Swift, and Open Problem-Solving</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] At the second day of the Political Consultative Conference, Member Zhou Enlai, following Member Zhang Qun, reported on the negotiations to cease military conflict, as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman, esteemed colleagues, concerning the progress of negotiations on ceasing military conflict and restoring all transportation, Mr. Zhang Yuejun has just provided a concise summary. Now that the ceasefire order has been issued and the ceasefire issue has been resolved, it is no longer the main subject of current consultation. Therefore, there is no need for me to elaborate on the details. However, should any of you have any questions, I will answer them to the best of my knowledge. I would now like to briefly share some lessons learned from the negotiations as a reference for the Political Consultative Conference in resolving all issues. The first lesson is whether the ceasefire negotiations should be conditional or unconditional. Domestic warfare, regardless of its cause or origin, is considered unfortunate by all. Everyone agrees that there should be no internal conflict during the War of Resistance against Japan, and that after the victory, the nation should be built peacefully. This is not only the consensus of the people but also the hope of the Allied nations. To successfully negotiate a ceasefire, it must be done without conditions. If conditions are debated, a resolution will not be reached. In the initial negotiations, the other side focused on arguing about ceasefire conditions, ultimately delaying the resolution of the issue. On one occasion, friends from the Democratic League invited representatives from both the government and the Communist Party for discussions. Mr. Huang Renzhi said, "Negotiations to stop the civil war should involve an unconditional ceasefire." We were deeply moved and believed this was a good approach to addressing the problem. Inspired by this, upon returning to Yan'an and obtaining the consent of the Central Committee of our Party, the CCP delegation came to Chongqing and proposed an unconditional cessation of internal conflict. This led to a result in the Three-Man Committee negotiations, ultimately resulting in the issuance of the ceasefire order. There is an additional point to clarify: in the Three-Man Committee, I reserved all the demands that we originally intended and should have made. We accepted all reasonable conditions proposed by the government side and made as many concessions as possible regarding those that could be considered. The cessation of conflict should, of course, be unconditional. The conditions reported by Mr. Zhang Yuejun are not additional conditions for the cessation of conflict but additional conditions for the cessation of movement. The cessation of conflict should be comprehensive and unconditional. We agreed to exceptions for justifiable troop movements, such as the government's need to reorganize its army south of the Yangtze River, which would necessitate some troop movements, and the government's need to send troops to the Northeast to take over national sovereignty. Only the third point, regarding Yi County and Duolun, was unacceptable to us because the CCP-led troops were already there taking over and stationed there. Ultimately, the government dropped this demand, which pleased us greatly, and a resolution was finally reached.</p>
<p>The second lesson is that problems the entire nation urgently expects to be solved should be solved immediately rather than delayed. We believe that decisive action should be taken. For example, the issue of civil war is opposed by the whole country and disapproved of by the world. Since all parties recognize that it is unfortunate, it should be resolved quickly. Mr. Zhang Yuejun has already said that every day the war is prolonged, the people suffer for another day. Yesterday, Mr. Que Mingshu cried and spoke out for the people, demanding that we resolve the issue immediately. This kind of delay, regardless of its cause or origin, is a lesson in problem-solving. By yesterday morning, the problem was resolved, and everyone was very happy, but we, the parties involved, should recognize that this is a matter of regret.</p>
<p>The third lesson is whether the negotiation method should be open or secret. Since a matter concerns the entire nation, the lives and property of 450 million people, the fate of the country, and even the concerns of the entire world, why should it be kept secret? Moreover, this matter involves the bloodshed of millions, so why should it be kept secret? Therefore, to resolve this problem, efforts must be made among a small number of representatives, but the matter should be made public. The resolution of this ceasefire issue, although handled by representatives from both negotiating parties and ultimately facilitated by General Marshall's support, was truly driven by the people's demands and the urging of public opinion. Because of the people's demands and public opinion, the world paid attention, leading to announcements from U.S. President Truman and the Council of Foreign Ministers. All of this public pressure created the momentum for resolving the issue. Therefore, we believe that any matter concerning the nation, the people, and the people can be made public to obtain public opinion. Understanding public opinion can lead to a standard for resolving the issue. Therefore, in the agreement reached between the government representatives and the CCP representatives, it was unanimously agreed to include a third item: the National Political Consultative Council and the National Assembly would each appoint eight impartial individuals other than the parties involved from the KMT and the CCP to form a military inspection team that would visit various locations to investigate with representatives from both the KMT and the CCP. Some people think that now that the war has stopped, the role of the military inspection team has been completely lost. In fact, as many newspapers have said today, this is only the first step of the beginning. To truly stop all military conflicts without exception and to fully restore all transportation without exception is a difficult project. The ceasefire order has been issued, and the ceasefire will take effect on the 13th. Major conflicts will stop completely, but minor disputes in areas where the order has not yet reached and in many blockaded areas will need to be resolved. Therefore, the supervision of the cessation of all military conflicts and the restoration of all transportation depends on the investigation and supervision of the military inspection team and its ability to offer opinions. Therefore, from past experience, we have learned that matters concerning tens of thousands of people and the people should be made public, as this is beneficial. The above three points are the lessons we have learned from resolving these issues. In summary, if we can all recognize the three methods of unconditional ceasefire, rapid resolution, and public disclosure, we can seek a solution sooner, reduce public criticism, and reduce international condemnation. This is an unfortunate situation, and it is hoped that all future issues can consider these principles, especially the second and third principles, which should be taken as a lesson. This is the first part of my report. "To be continued"</p>

<h3>Non-Permanent Members of the Security Council: Five of Six Seats Elected - Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, Netherlands, and Poland Elected</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] Five of the six non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council have been elected. They are Brazil with 47 votes, Egypt with 45 votes, Mexico with 45 votes, Poland with 39 votes, and the Netherlands with 37 votes. All of the above were elected in the first round of voting. Canada received 33 votes in the first round of voting, with one vote abstaining, which was short of the required 34 votes. A second round of voting was held, resulting in Australia receiving 27 votes and Canada receiving 23 votes, both short of the required number. A third round of voting will be held after the resumption of the meeting this afternoon. The five elected members, as well as Canada, were on the list of candidates distributed by the U.S. delegation. Other votes received in the first round of voting were: Iran with 6 votes, Norway with 5 votes, Ukraine with 5 votes, and Denmark with 4 votes. It is reported that the Soviet Union originally supported Norway and Belgium to be elected, but at the last minute, the Ukrainian delegation supported Norway and New Zealand.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] Before the opening of the General Assembly, the U.S. delegation proposed that Brazil, Canada, and the Netherlands each serve as non-permanent members for two years, and Poland, Egypt, and Mexico each serve for one year, but the Soviet Union expressed disagreement with Mexico and the Netherlands.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative's Motion Ultimately Rejected</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] At the United Nations General Assembly today, the Soviet representative proposed a motion to postpone the election of the six non-permanent members of the Security Council, which was rejected after a roll-call vote, with 34 votes against, 9 votes in favor, and 8 abstentions. This motion was proposed by Soviet representative Andrei Gromyko at the beginning of the meeting today, opposed by U.S. delegation head Secretary of State Byrnes, and not allowed to wait for British Foreign Secretary Bevin to stand up to speak for Britain on the election matter, because only two people were allowed to speak for or against the Soviet motion. Bevin then indicated that Britain opposed the Soviet motion. The four countries allowed to speak on the motion were the United States and Costa Rica in opposition, and the Soviet Union and New Zealand in favor. After the vote, the countries that supported the Soviet motion were: the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Belarus, New Zealand, Australia, Denmark, and Norway. The countries in Latin America, the Middle East, and Western Europe, including Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, opposed the postponement of the election. Gromyko explained the Soviet motion, saying that the election of non-permanent members of the Security Council was undoubtedly a very important issue, and that some representatives had only arrived in London three or four days ago and had no sufficient time to discuss this issue with other representative countries, nor to discuss this election issue with other governments, so the Soviet delegation decided that the election should be postponed until the end of next week. When Byrnes spoke, his tone was high and clear, interspersed with gestures to assist his tone, and the hall was silent, listening attentively. Byrnes warned the representatives not to allow this "precedent that will undermine the future work of the General Assembly." He said that this was not a matter of convenience or inconvenience, but of preventing the delay of agreed-upon work at the request of one representative. Soviet Ukrainian delegation head Manuilsky proposed that the distribution of non-permanent seats on the Security Council be as follows: two seats for Latin American countries, which he proposed be filled by Brazil and Mexico; one seat for South Pacific countries, which he proposed be filled by New Zealand; one seat for Eastern Europe, which he proposed be filled by Poland; one seat for Middle Eastern countries, which he proposed be filled by Egypt or Saudi Arabia; and one seat for Scandinavia, which he proposed be filled by Norway.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Work of the General Assembly Completed: Important Stage - Committees Elect Chairmen</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The United Nations General Assembly elected the chairmen of the various committees yesterday afternoon, taking on the liaison work between the various councils of the General Assembly and the General Assembly, and the preliminary work of the United Nations organization has now completed another important stage. Reliable sources believe that the British representatives' tasks in the various committees of the General Assembly have been assigned as follows: "Political Security Committee" Foreign Secretary Bevin, Minister of State Noel-Baker; "Economic and Financial Committee" Noel-Baker, Deputy Secretary McNeil; "Social Welfare and Cultural Committee" Minister of Education Wilkinson, Deputy Undersecretary Henderson; "Trusteeship Committee" Deputy Undersecretary of the Colonial Office Jones; "Administrative Budget Committee" Financial Undersecretary Hall, Labour MP Young; "Legal Committee" Attorney General Shawcross, Henderson. As for the British candidate for judge of the International Court of Justice, it is believed to be Sir Michael Nayar, a prominent British international jurist. Soviet Ukrainian delegation head Manuilsky was unanimously elected as chairman of the Political Security Committee after being nominated by Chinese delegation member Gu Weijun. This is one of the most important committees, serving as a liaison between the General Assembly and the Security Council. Issues such as atomic energy and its control will be handled by the Security Council. The other committee chairmen are as follows: "Social Welfare and Cultural Committee" New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser; "Trusteeship Committee" Uruguayan delegation head and Uruguayan Ambassador to the UK Macegan; "Administrative Committee" Syrian delegation head Shuli; "Economic and Financial Committee" Iranian Foreign Minister Rimoski; "Legal Committee" Panamanian delegation head Geminis. The Legal Committee will serve as liaison between the General Assembly and the International Court of Justice.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Credentials Committee: Executive Secretary Position, Our Representative Elected as Committee Member</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 11th] At this morning's plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly, China, France, Belarus, Haiti, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Denmark were elected as members of the Credentials Committee, with Denmark serving as the chairman of the committee.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] The two hundred and fifty representatives of the United Nations General Assembly, who met all day yesterday, although tired, gained a great deal. The morning meeting passed the agenda of the General Assembly, appointed six committees to accept the reports of the Preparatory Committee, established the Credentials Committee, authorized the Executive Secretary to temporarily act as Secretary-General, and debated two issues. Fortunately, Chairman Spaak was capable and talented, so he was able to quickly complete various tasks. This agency's diplomatic reporter said that one of the issues debated yesterday morning was the Cuban representative's proposal to limit the powers of the Standing Committee. The Standing Committee is no less than the guiding committee of the General Assembly. During the San Francisco Conference, some people also tried to protect the sovereignty of the General Assembly with a jealous attitude. The amendment proposed by the Cuban representative refers to the Review and Reporting Committee. All American countries, except for greater Canada, supported the Cuban motion, advocating limiting the term of the committee to one week.</p>
<h3>Attending the United Nations General Assembly: Our Delegation's Lineup - A Total of Thirty-Six Representatives, Gu Weijun Concurrently Serving as Chief Representative</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 12th Special Dispatch] After Chuan Bingchang and Jin Wensi arrived here today, the members of our delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly, numbering thirty-six people, have been completed. All the representatives held their first meeting at the Chinese Embassy in the UK this afternoon. Our chief representative, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, was unable to come to England due to attending the domestic Political Consultative Conference, so Dr. Gu Weijun concurrently serves as acting chief representative. The other representatives are Fu Bingchang, Qian Tai, and Zhang Pengchun. Hu Shize, Jin Wensi, and Liang Long are deputy representatives. The delegation's advisors include Xu Shuxi, Sa Bendong, Guo Youshou, Liang Yunli, Ye Gongchao, Zhang Zhehang, Zhang Dechang, and Shi Siming, a total of eight people. The entourage includes Liu Xuancui, Ren Qishen, Zhai Fengyang, and Tao Yin, a total of four people. Our delegation's secretariat is headed by Minister Zhang Qian as Secretary-General, and Counselor Shi Zhao of the Embassy in the UK as Deputy Secretary-General. There is also one administrative secretary, seven secretaries, and seven assistant secretaries. Our delegation has established a press liaison office, with Ye Gongchao serving as the director.</p>
<h3>Six Subcommittees: Assignment of Attendees</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 11th] After two meetings, our delegation has assigned the following representatives to attend the six subcommittees established at today's General Assembly: "Political Security" Gu Weijun, Jin Wensi; "Economic and Financial" Chuan Bingchang, Hu Shize; "Social Charity and Culture" Zhang Pengchun, Hu Shize, Guo Youshou; "Trusteeship" Gu Weijun, Jin Wensi; "Administrative Budget" Hu Shize, Liang Long; "Legal" Qian Tai, Liang Yunli.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun: Most Reputable</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 11th] It is generally believed that our country's acting chief representative, Gu Weijun, is the most reputable representative at the United Nations General Assembly. Among the representatives of various countries, Gu is the only one who has served as the chief representative of the old League of Nations. Although some other representatives attended the League of Nations, they were generally only representatives or secretaries. William, the hall messenger of the General Assembly Hall, has served as the hall messenger of countless international conferences, and his knowledge of the representatives of various countries is greater than anyone else's. Yesterday, when the General Assembly opened, a reporter from the Daily Mail asked who was the most reputable among the representatives of various countries, and William replied without hesitation: "Dr. Gu Weijun of China." This William, who has served as a hall messenger for forty years, also said, "Chinese representatives are generally courteous."</p>
<h3>The Tatar Strait Issue: Will Be Submitted to the General Assembly for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] According to sources close to the State Department, Secretary of State Byrnes will raise the difficult issue of the Tatar Strait at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly. It is said that the United States' position on this issue has not changed, and it still maintains the views held in the document from the government to the Turkish government in November of last year. In this document, the U.S. government urged that this issue be resolved on an international basis. These people said that the United States supports resolving it through diplomatic negotiations within the framework of the Montreux Convention, with the participation of the United States, and then submitting it to the United Nations organization. They also said that Washington, in view of the recent territorial disputes between the Soviet Union and Turkey, clearly does not want to adopt an attitude that could be seen as favoring either country.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Has No Intention of Assuming the Post of Secretary-General of the United Nations</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, London, 11th] According to press reports last night, Secretary of State Byrnes announced that General Eisenhower had informed him that he had no intention of accepting the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations organization.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Ottawa, 11th] Eisenhower gave a speech at a luncheon in Ottawa yesterday, urging international cooperation, as exemplified by the U.S.-Canada relationship.</p>

<h3>Prime Minister Shidehara barely survives: Cabinet reshuffle completed, five new cabinet members scheduled to take office this morning</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 12th] It is reported that the Shidehara Cabinet has completed its reshuffle today. The six resigning cabinet members have been replaced by five new cabinet members, so that the government maintains its conservative and non-partisan nature. The new cabinet members are scheduled to take office in the Imperial Palace tomorrow, but they must first obtain permission from the United Nations Command. The new cabinet members will remain in office until the election. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Soejima, 64 years old, former Chairman of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and has held important positions in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. (2) Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of Transport and Communications Misa, 74 years old. (3) Minister of Education Abe, 65 years old. (4) Chief Cabinet Secretary Narahashi, transferred from Director of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau. (5) Director of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau Ishiguro, 42 years old, former Director of the Ministry of Home Affairs. (6) Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Tagiri, 49 years old, former Minister to the Philippines and Counselor of the Embassy in China. All other cabinet members, including Cabinet constitutional expert Dr. Matsumoto, have remained unchanged.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] Sources in political circles announced today that five cabinet members submitted their resignations at yesterday's cabinet meeting, and replacements are currently being sought, but MacArthur's approval must be sought before appointments are made. It is still unclear whether there are any other resignations. However, the cabinet reshuffle can be completed before the 15th, at which time Prime Minister Shidehara is expected to attend the regular cabinet meeting. It is said that Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Matsumura and Minister without Portfolio Tsuda strongly urged Shidehara to reshuffle the cabinet and not resign en masse. Both have submitted their resignations. It is said that the other three resignees are Minister of Home Affairs Horikiri, Minister of Education Maeda, and Minister of Transport Tanaka. All five resigned voluntarily, so that Shidehara would not be forced to resign due to the past activities of these people. Minister without Portfolio Matsumoto, former president of the South Manchurian Railway, was also affected by MacArthur's instructions, but since Matsudaira is currently the chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Constitutional Revision, he may be asked to remain temporarily.</p>
<h3>Japanese Unemployed Population: 3.25 Million</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] Diplomatic circles report that Liu Zenghua, our country's liaison commissioner to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Tokyo, Japan, is scheduled to leave Chongqing for Japan on the 13th.</p>

<h3>Reason for Delay in Delivery of Japan's Declaration of War to the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, December 12] Former Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Nomura, stated to a United Press reporter today: The coded telegram of Japan's declaration of war against the United States was received by the Japanese Embassy in Washington two and a half hours before the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, due to the embassy's inefficiency, it was delivered late. By the time Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu delivered the telegram to the State Department, it was about an hour after the Pearl Harbor attack. At that time, US Secretary of State Hull was greatly angered and, after reading the lengthy telegram, told the two of them, "It is incomprehensible that any country in the world could send such a nonsensical document."</p>
<h3>Twenty-Two Dwarfs to Film New Movie</h3>
<p>Amusing Incident Amidst a Housing Shortage</p>
<p>[United Press, Hollywood, December 11] Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) is hiring twenty-two dwarfs to play roles in the film "The Three Stooges." Unexpectedly, due to the severe housing shortage in Los Angeles, they could not find accommodation. MGM Studios had to take matters into their own hands and added a kitchen to each of the seven actors' dressing rooms, with three people living in each room. However, there was still one dwarf with no place to live. Emerson, the manager of the studio's zoo, wrote a note to the supervisors, saying, "I heard you have a dwarf lacking housing. I wonder if the kangaroos can help you?" This is also an amusing incident amidst the housing shortage.</p>
<h3>US Economic Experts Observe World Trade Trends</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, December 11] Government economic experts have recently raised two major issues regarding world trade trends after 1946: (1) Can the United States produce enough goods to meet the needs of the entire world? (2) Can foreign countries affected by the war obtain US currency to purchase American goods? Economic expert Kelly of the Department of Commerce commented on the world market awaiting US exports: "There is virtually no American product that cannot be sold. The types and quantities of goods needed by foreign countries include almost all food, raw materials, consumer goods, and production tools. The urgency and breadth of this demand are hard to imagine. In some countries, people have not added new clothes for five years, and the urgency of their need for textiles is conceivable. Other urgently needed items, such as [missing character], railway materials, machine tools, farm implements, lumber, etc., are merely a small part of the total." Kelly predicted that in 1950, US export trade would reach $10 billion, including $4 billion in exports to the United Kingdom annually, and $2 billion in exports to Latin America annually. The remaining exports to Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, the Union of South Africa, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Italy would be between $200 million and $300 million annually. The total US exports in 1944 amounted to $14.3 billion, including $11.3 billion in materials exported under the Lend-Lease Act, and $3 billion in commercial exports. The total exports in the first nine months of 1945 amounted to $8 billion, including $5.2 billion in Lend-Lease exports and $2.8 billion in commercial exports.</p>
<p>Assuming that the United States can manage to supply the needs of the huge world market, whether foreign countries have the ability to pay remains a question. Currently, only about ten countries in Latin America have a large surplus, but their purchases of American goods are also limited. Foreign countries without surplus funds have only three options: (1) Borrow from the United States, (2) Sell goods to the United States, (3) Provide tourism services. If the United States wants to continue to maintain a high level of exports, it must import as many foreign goods as possible. Only in this way can foreign countries obtain US currency to purchase American goods. Therefore, the urgent task for the United States is to raise the domestic economic level so as to create a large domestic import market. The total US imports in 1945 amounted to $3.5 billion. According to the US Department of Commerce, the total imports in 1946 will increase to $5.2 billion.</p>
<h3>Thirty-Five Thousand British Troops to be Stationed in Japan Shortly - Auchinleck to Inspect Troops in India</h3>

<h3>US National Telephone Workers Began General Strike the Day Before Yesterday - Long-Distance Calls Also Interrupted Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, December 12] US national telephone workers began their strike at 7:00 AM yesterday (New York time, 8:00 PM Friday Shanghai time), bringing national telephone traffic to a standstill. A Labor Department spokesman said that if the labor unrest continues to expand and completely shuts down the nation's telephones, the government will take over the telephone company. Members of the Traffic Communications Equipment Workers Association began blockading the New York office of American Telephone and Telegraph Company at 7:30 PM yesterday (Shanghai time), and telephone traffic was quickly affected. When this agency's New York bureau inquired with the telephone company via teletype, they were told that only emergency calls could be accepted at present, and transatlantic telephone service was also affected. The operator explained, "Due to a labor dispute, I cannot connect you." In addition to New York, large cities such as Washington, Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia also have workers implementing blockades. Telephone union president Weaver previously announced that the strike would be postponed until Monday, but has now withdrawn that statement due to the union's failure to lift the blockade. (According to a New York radio station, the latest news is that the telephone shutdown is unavoidable, and long-distance calls have also been interrupted this morning.)</p>
<h3>Severe Earthquake Recorded</h3>

<h3>Einstein Discusses the Jewish Question</h3>
<p>Points to Britain's Divide-and-Rule Policy in Palestine</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, December 12] Jewish scientist Albert Einstein, the inventor of the theory of relativity, told the British-American Palestine Investigation Committee today: Although I have never publicly advocated the establishment of a Jewish state, I feel that allowing Jews with nowhere to live to immigrate to Palestine is not against the laws of nature. Jews in Palestine can live together like relatives and friends. I believe that most of the Arab opposition is created by the British. When the British-American committee asked Einstein if he was unaware that Britain, as the mandatory power, would have to use force if it intended to allow Jews to immigrate, Einstein said that if the Arab opposition was not due to instigation, it would not be necessary. Einstein further said that he personally felt that Britain's colonial policy in Palestine was promoted by collusion between British officials and the local "Quisling faction," and other evidence also pointed to this. Britain is known for being good at creating trouble, and he personally felt that Palestine was no different from a small India.</p>
<h3>Rare and Exotic Fruits from Thousands of Miles Away Can Be Delivered Fresh to Your Doorstep - Air Transport Makes Ideal a Reality</h3>
<p>[United Press, Kansas City, December 11] Rare and exotic fruits picked from the fields of Egypt or India on Monday morning can be delivered to Kansas City for lunch on Wednesday. This is an ideal of post-war commercial aviation, and may be realized within a year. If it really succeeds, it will be the result of two years of high-altitude flight experimentation. This experimentation began in 1943, when the US Department of Agriculture used an airplane filled with flowers, flying from Los Angeles to Reno, Nevada. In addition to staff from several airlines, a West Coast floriculturist was also on board. The purpose of the experiment was to determine the effect of high altitude and air pressure on various flowers, such as begonias, roses, gardenias, and orchids. At the time, the plane was flying at an altitude of 25,000 feet, where the outside temperature was almost -48 degrees Celsius. All the flowers were wrapped in absorbent wet paper, except for the orchids, which were tightly sealed in glass tubes. The passengers in the plane were wearing gas masks. When the plane arrived in Reno and the flowers were taken out for inspection, it was found that the roses had sprouted prematurely, and all the flowers except the orchids had withered. The sealed glass tubes seemed like small greenhouses, unaffected by the outside air pressure, so the orchids inside were still very fresh, like those displayed in a florist's window. Subsequently, researchers continued to experiment and finally came to the conclusion that any flower could be safely transported at a normal altitude of about 10,000 feet without wilting. After the flowers, fruits and vegetables were also tested. The first experiment was funded by a Kansas City grocer. Fresh spinach picked from the fields of California was loaded into an airplane and flown eastward overnight, and was displayed on the grocer's shelves for sale the next morning. Next, Indian plums, peaches, and other fruits were tested. Now, Heng, of Transcontinental and Western Air, and representatives from other companies are conducting other experiments. However, everyone's biggest ideal is to airlift food from the fields of India, Egypt, and other remote countries to the United States. As for when the ideal can become a reality, according to Heng, "Please wait six months. Once overseas air passenger service begins, we can deliver food from various countries to your kitchen."</p>

<h3>Symphony of Bustling Sounds and Harmony! Prelude to the Consultative Conference... Sketches of the General Members' Tea Party...</h3>
<p>— Zhao Haosheng reporting from the wartime capital</p>
<p>Like a spring thunder in the first New Year after victory, Chairman Chiang announced on New Year's Day: The Political Consultative Conference will be convened on January 10. The people of the whole country are watching the holding of this conference with hope. For the past half-month, Chongqing's journalists have been revolving around this event with all their energy.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 7th, all the representatives attending the Political Consultative Conference held a tea party to exchange opinions on general issues. The venue was the conference room of the Military Affairs Commission. A long rectangular hall, with roaring fires in the four corners, and sunlight shining through the green curtains, made people feel exceptionally warm. On the wall facing a row of long windows hung a large photograph of the chairman, and the chairman's handwritten motto "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame, the Four Pillars of a Nation..." In this solemn environment, holding this historically significant gathering, people felt exceptionally solemn.</p>
<p>Among the representatives, apart from Mo Dehui in the Northeast, Zhang Junmai in the United States, and Huang Yanpei and Zhang Lan absent due to illness, the thirty-four representatives present sat around a long table. On the table, two large antique porcelain vases were filled with plum blossoms and chrysanthemums, plus mimeographed documents, recording paper, representatives' briefcases, Guan Shengyuan's black tea, and long chopsticks, decorated a long conference table into a colorful pattern. A group of news reporters surrounded the sofas around them, using cameras and pen tips to accompany the representatives' conversations. The first person on the right was Secretary-General Lei Zhen, with a particularly large pile of documents in front of him. He first reported: The official opening date is 10:00 AM on the 10th, and it has been decided to invite Chinese and foreign reporters to attend. Twenty-three Chinese reporters and fifteen foreign reporters. The secretariat has prepared entry and exit permits. The conversation began.</p>
<p>Solemnly Assuming the Role of Temporary Chairman</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Ke</p>
<p>Shen Junru raised the issue of seating arrangements, believing that the representatives of each party could sit together according to the list published by the government. Mr. Fu Sinian, wearing a long robe, stood up and said in a very strong Shandong accent: According to Mr. Shen Junru's opinion, if the various parties sit together, then the non-partisan representatives may as well sit in the last row, because: "Originally, we are here to respectfully take the last seat." Thus, the issue was decided according to Mr. Fu's opinion. The representatives of the Democratic League had prepared various key points in advance.</p>
<p>Liang Shuming Reported on the Key Points Mr. Liang, wearing a gray robe and holding a large piece of paper recording the key points of the conversation, stood up and spoke. He first said that he hoped everyone would be more self-critical and self-motivated in order to create a harmonious atmosphere. Then he raised the issue of amending Articles 4 and 6 of the conference rules, as well as the implementation of various matters stipulated in the government-CCP meeting minutes.</p>
<p>Always Piling His Face with Smiles</p>
<p>Mr. Shao Lizi</p>
<p>Mr. Shao Lizi, smiling, this old gentleman stood up after Mr. Liang finished speaking and said in a sincere and kind voice: In order to make the conference proceed in a harmonious atmosphere, everyone should look forward to the future. The government's decision to convene this consultative conference is, in fact, willing to discuss state affairs with all parties. Regarding the implementation of various matters in the meeting minutes mentioned by Mr. Liang, Mr. Shao specifically recited the original text, explaining Mr. Liang's error in quotation. Finally, he said that the points mentioned by Mr. Liang should not have been raised in the conversation, and he expressed his regret for this.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang, with an attitude of taking the lead in self-criticism, said: "Shuming accepts Mr. Shao's words!"</p>
<p>Mr. Fu Sinian also felt that the amendment to the conference rules proposed by Mr. Liang should be resolved in the conference procedure. Regarding adding the word "responsible" in Article 6, Mr. Fu felt that the Political Consultative Conference was not an institution legally produced, but although it does not have the restraint of law, it has the great power of morality, and there is no need to worry that the government will not implement the resolutions. Regarding Mr. Fu's opinion, Mr. Liang also stood up and expressed his acceptance.</p>
<p>Regarding the agenda, the time of the meeting, and the voting rights, Mr. Zeng Qi, Mr. Miao Yuntai, Mr. Fu Sinian, and Mr. Zhou Enlai all spoke enthusiastically. Everyone felt that the easier to solve problems should be arranged in front, and the more difficult ones in the back.</p>
<p>Zeng Qi advocated more debate. Regarding the issue of meeting time, everyone felt that meetings should be held for half a day, and off-site consultations should be held for half a day, because many old gentlemen were afraid that their energy would not be enough.</p>
<p>When Miao Yuntai used "numbers" to explain the issue of voting rights, President Sun looked at him and said, "After all, it's a banker's point of view!"</p>
<p>Chen Lifu's temples were graying, but Mr. Chen's face was full of fresh vitality. He sat with Mr. Wang Yunwu, whose hair was gray, and talked from time to time. He often had to ask Mr. Zhou Enlai, who was sitting beside him, with whispers and slips of paper.</p>
<p>The thirty-four representatives communicated with each other in words of knowing everything and saying everything, and passed around plates of hot snacks. The whole room was full of warmth and harmony.</p>
<p>President Sun Stood Up Again</p>
<p>At that time, the sound of "Attention" suddenly came from outside, and in the distance, the music of the Military Affairs Commission raising the flag and playing the national anthem sounded. Then, everyone in the hall stood up in unison. This sound, representing infinite nobility and brilliance, vibrated heavily and solemnly. "One heart, one virtue, consistently from beginning to end..." Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions will resonate for thousands of years and shine with the sun and moon. In this solemn sound, those who are discussing national affairs today will feel a great inspiration.</p>
<p>Sun Xiaochang explained that the secretariat could handle the opinions raised by the representatives without question, and that issues would be formally submitted to the conference for discussion, and Minister Wang Shijie made some valuable suggestions to the reporters. Mr. Shao Lizi finally stated that because it was a consultation, the number of people could not be too large, and he hoped that those who asked to participate would forgive him!</p>
<p>When President Sun announced the adjournment of the meeting, it was already 5:15. Everyone rushed to the cocktail party held by the CCP in Shengda Building.</p>
<p>When Shao Congen walked out of the venue, a young lady waiting to take care of him came up to put a scarf on him, put on a hat, and helped him down the steps. Mr. Wang Yunwu's third son, Changtian, got married in the morning, and he still had some joy on his face. The prelude to the Political Consultative Conference ended in an extremely harmonious and pleasant atmosphere. A good start is half the battle. (Posted January 9)</p>
<p>News Reporters Surrounded... Mr. Wang Shijie</p>
<h3>New Scenery, Hot Atmosphere: A Day in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>— By Our Guangzhou Special Correspondent, Liang Feng</p>
<p>One firecracker blast banishes the old!</p>
<p>What rises to take its place now is the clear and beautiful chime of the Yuehai Customs House clock, and the soul-stirring long blasts of steam whistles. In this quiet late night, the melody of the clock and the whistles resonates throughout the entire City of Five Rams. The former tells people that the "Victory Year" has arrived, and the latter, although signifying that from that moment on, vehicles and horses will keep to the right, this long, drawn-out鸣鸣 sound seems to possess a very deep meaning. The "all clear" signal shows that the intense, tense, and arduous era of the War of Resistance has passed. This is a victory cry, and also the first sound of Guangzhou welcoming the Victory Year.</p>
<p>Distinctive Symbol: National Flags Flutter on Lapels</p>
<p>The first thing that catches the eye on New Year's Day is the national flag flying everywhere. It flutters not only in the sky, atop the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, and in the streets and alleys, but also on people's lapels. It is a distinctive symbol. People are vying to buy a small national flag to wear on their chests. Perhaps you might ask, "What is this all about?" It turns out that this is part of a flag-selling fundraising campaign by the Guangdong community to celebrate the New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic and expand emergency relief efforts. Eighty teams of middle school students across the city are organized to solicit donations on the streets, offering a flag in exchange for any amount of money donated, but people usually donated one hundred yuan. If you don't have that "National Flag Pass," then you'll have to stop, and the children will surround you.</p>
<p>Releasing Eight Years of Depression: Six Hundred Thousand People Take to the Streets</p>
<p>If Guangzhou has a million people, then at least six hundred thousand were on the streets on New Year's Day. For eight years! They dared not say what they wanted to say, dared not do what they wanted to do. Today, they can laugh loudly and shout loudly. Faced with such a grand occasion, how could they not release the depression that has been suppressed for eight years, and not fully open their hearts? No one wants to stay at home. Everyone welcomes this first New Year's Day holiday after victory with exceptional excitement and joy. People are squeezing and squeezing, and the streets are almost impassable. From time to time, there are lion dance troupes organized by labor unions and martial arts associations passing by, one after another, bizarre and colorful, with gongs and drums filling the air, and the majestic lions dancing, attracting the attention of many passersby. The lions are surrounded by large crowds everywhere, causing traffic jams. The sounds of car horns and the shouts of rickshaw pullers are ignored as everyone watches the lions. This noisy and chaotic symphony highlights the even more lively atmosphere on the streets.</p>
<p>Vehicles and Horses Keep to the Right: Boy Scouts Fully Mobilized</p>
<p>In this bustling and noisy crowd, sometimes a small group of boy scouts walks by. They are truly lovable. They are neatly dressed and energetically walk with brisk steps. They are not idly strolling, but are responsible for helping to maintain traffic. Because it is the first day that vehicles and horses are keeping to the right, it is feared that drivers and pedestrians are not yet accustomed, causing traffic order to be disrupted. Therefore, police officers throughout the city, members of the Youth Corps, members of the city party department service team, and students throughout the city are participating in this supervisory work. In the light drizzle, they fully demonstrate their spirit of service.</p>
<p>Grand Exhibition: Satiating the Eyes with Enemy Military Items</p>
<p>The exhibition of historical relics of the War of Resistance and war trophies also opened on New Year's Day. Jiaozhong Middle School on Wende Road is more lively than usual, swallowing a large number of curious people. Those who have not experienced the baptism of gunfire can also go and see, so they can know how arduous our country's War of Resistance was. The venue is divided into three parts for the exhibition. The first part is items seized from the enemy military, including more than thirty kinds of various types of Japanese rifles, and more than a dozen types of light and heavy machine guns. There are also communication equipment used by the enemy military, large and small wireless radios, telephones, 愛排,雙　搜搬蠶的會令　令教範日記文件, all of which are valuable items. The enemy military's equipment is also neatly displayed, such as enemy military uniforms, shoes, bedding, mosquito nets, pillowcases, all of which are very complete. There are also hand grenades, engineering equipment, artillery observation instruments, and many other types, truly dazzling and inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Tanaka Wears a "Prisoner" Armband: Enemy Military Put on a Performance</p>
<p>The second part is heavy weapons and transportation equipment. All kinds of large and small artillery pieces and mobile generators used by the Japanese army are scattered on the square. On the walls around the auditorium, more than four hundred extremely valuable photographs are hung. The most attractive among them is a photo of Tanaka Hisaichi, the former commander of the Japanese 23rd Army and Governor of Hong Kong. In the photo, Tanaka Hisaichi's hat and military insignia have been removed, and he wears an armband with the word "Prisoner" on it. On this day, Commander Zhang Faqui also came to visit. When he saw Tanaka's photo, he immediately ordered his attendants to bring Tanaka's saber, which had been presented to him, to add to the interest. The third part is the New First Army's military animal performance ground. Inside, there are military dogs, military 鳃, military　, etc. These were originally trained by the Japanese army. They used to love being commanded in Japanese, but after being captured by our army and retrained, they can now listen to　　语 commands. When they perform various skills, gasps of surprise and admiration can be heard in the crowd.</p>
<p>If you don't feel that today is a holiday from any lively place, then you can look at the newspaper supplements. Rows of newspapers are displayed on the newsstands, vying for beauty. Red covers, extra-large red characters. Dagong Bao sacrifices especially, producing five large sheets, still selling for fifty yuan. "Zhongshan" and "Zhongzheng" are not willing to lag behind, both producing three and a half sheets, and the rest are two and a half to three sheets, and so on. Moreover, on Guangfu Middle Road, which is known as "Guangzhou Wangping Street," the Zhongshan Daily News Agency is decorated with colorful silk, dazzling and eye-catching, attracting many passersby to look up.</p>
<p>Lantern Parade: Gongs and Drums Fill the Air, Lion and Dragon Dance</p>
<p>Among all the events today, the most powerful, most exciting, and most attractive should be the lantern parade. The parade starts at six o'clock in the afternoon. Participating are party, government, and military agencies, schools, mass organizations, and various businesses, all sending personnel to make lanterns, costumes, dramas, dragon dances, and lion dances, with a total of 20,000 people. The long procession, brightly lit and filled with the sound of gongs and drums. The huge dragon and the majestic lions are doing their best to fly and dance, complementing each other. Among them, the 54th Army's participation is even more ingenious. They use jeeps to create huge moving fish, crabs, turtles, and彩龍船, stilts, costumes, etc. Other groups also have fish lanterns, oil chicken lanterns, etc. The streets they pass through are crowded with people, and the situation is so lively that it is truly unprecedented in Guangzhou in the past eight years.</p>
<p>The new scenery and the joyful, boiling atmosphere fill the entire New Year. This flourishing scene seems to be the enjoyment that a citizen of a victorious nation should have. However, from today onwards, the creation of history begins a new page. We should create miracles of a bright and glorious future, and spread this flourishing scene to every corner of the world.</p>
<h3>Three Thousand One Hundred Mile High Altitude Flight: Across the Atlantic</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent, Zhu Jiarang</p>
<p>The ideal way to go from Europe to the United States is to take a "Queen" class ocean liner. It's truly a case of good value for money, stable, fast, and comfortable. But in the aftermath of the war, American soldiers are returning home in droves, and cabin space is extremely limited, often requiring a wait of two or three months. Moreover, according to my passport, it's good enough to travel by plane, so the British government put me on a flight list and told me to wait for good news. The departure date was close, as if it were just around the corner. But in fact, I waited a full three weeks before I could escape from the European continent.</p>
<p>Sea and Air Routes: Traffic Control Not Yet Lifted</p>
<p>Here, I would like to briefly describe the recent traffic conditions between Britain and the United States, which may be of assistance to future travelers. At present, the sea and air traffic between Britain and the United States is still largely under government control. However, Pan American Airlines and American Overseas Airlines have recently been able to carry passengers freely, without restrictions. As for maritime transport, it is still under the jurisdiction of the British Ministry of Transport. Without obtaining a priority permit, you cannot buy a ticket. But even if you obtain a priority permit, you can only rely on luck to get on a particular ship. It is easier to travel from the United States to Britain on a "Queen" ship than from Britain to the United States. It's already quite miserable to travel on an ordinary small ship. The interior furnishings are not very grand, which is a small matter, but the shaking is slow and unsettling, making it difficult to sit or stand still. Moreover, it takes ten or more days, which is truly a living hell. Especially in winter, the weather in the North Atlantic is bad, and the wind and waves are too strong. Recently, before Christmas, several ships in the ocean were caught in snowstorms, almost encountering accidents. Some turned back to repair their ships, and one drifted for eighteen days before finally arriving safely in the United States. They missed their Christmas holidays in disappointment. In terms of air transport, Britain and the United States each have their own systems. The British system is mainly for Overseas Airways. In winter, they usually take the southern route, which detours through Portugal. The route is long, the journey is long, and the price is also the most expensive, almost 800 US dollars. The northern route flies directly from Glasgow to Canada. The route is shorter and the fare is also cheaper. However, in terms of economy, it is still not as good as American civil aviation. When I was in London, a Pan American ticket to New York was only 93 pounds, which is about 372 US dollars. At one point, the price was automatically reduced to 65 pounds, but because Britain strongly opposed it, it returned to the original amount. However, because the price was low, the number of people registering was more crowded than the British planes. I had a special discussion with the company this time, and they promised to let me board earlier, but the British government's notice also arrived just in time. In order to maintain "international credibility," I finally gave up the cheap goods that I had already obtained.</p>
<p>Flying to Scotland: Crossing the Atlantic That Night</p>
<p>The sky was so gloomy, and rain was falling. We, a group of three, got into a large bus and drove for two hours to reach the airport. The place was so quiet. Besides the coal fire in the fireplace, which was still burning quite strongly, coupled with the emptiness in my heart, this trip of mine was the most unnatural. Seeing the rain getting heavier and heavier, I didn't know when I would be able to reach the distant future. The two others with me, one was the director of the Washington branch of British scientific research, and the other was a film merchant from Toronto, Canada. They were both honest and straightforward, and we could talk. Moreover, the film merchant's wife was the daughter of a clergyman, and she grew up in Zigong, Sichuan. Therefore, she was also interested in China. In this way, two hours were passed, and we all took off into the air.</p>
<p>This route first flies from London to Glasgow, Scotland. This is the second largest city in Britain, and Liverpool is also an important port. Many Chinese seamen are also concentrated here. In Glasgow, we stayed for another two and a half hours, ate a fairly sumptuous dinner, and then we were about to make the feat of crossing the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Body and Mind Shaking: Please Help Me in an Emergency</p>
<p>Under the fine rain, the cold wind outdoors was piercing to the bone. The weather was not very good, and the distance between the two continents, America and Europe, shown on the map was so long. For an inexperienced person like me, to be honest, I was a little worried about this flight. Plus, half an hour before departure, as usual, we had to listen to lectures and watch exercises on how to carry an oxygen bag and how to put on a life jacket, which made me even more uneasy, as if a disaster was about to strike. I even instinctively opened my mouth to the British doctor and said, "If there is an emergency, please help me!" Thinking about it afterwards, I felt it was really ridiculous.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock in the evening, the Liberty-style giant plane was ready to take off. We each钻进 the seats from 下. According to the weather that day, we had to 越 the cloud layer and fly at high altitude. Sure enough, in less than an hour,　　　告：the plane had reached 17,000 feet, and everyone had to wear oxygen masks to help them breathe. The temperature reached a minimum of minus thirty-three degrees Celsius. Although the heating pipes were all turned on, and three woolen blankets were added to our bodies, and we were wearing large cotton shoes, we were still軋軋 shivering. Touching the clothes on our bodies, they felt like they had been taken out of the refrigerator. Everyone's expressions were a bit serious, but we couldn't sleep, nor could we fall asleep. The flight attendants kept bringing coffee and cake, but everyone just shook their heads and thanked them.</p>
<p>However, that day's flight was indeed a very good success. Beforehand, the station reported that this pilot had flown across the Atlantic a hundred times. It seemed that he was quite experienced, so except for one or two short periods of　　　而外, we were all like walking on flat ground, even more stable than a train. The giant plane roared like thunder, with immense power. On the boundless, white-capped ocean, in the treacherous, remote, and渺的 high sky, it was always strong, brave, and moving forward. I thought we could rest our feet in Newfoundland, but轰隆轰隆, happy and tireless. As a result, we only landed upon reaching Montreal (Montrasal). Checking the map, it was a total of 3,141 miles. I had completed it all in one go. I hadn't even seen the Atlantic Ocean, and now I had already landed on the other shore.</p>
<p>An Unexpected Detour: Touring the Scenery of Canada</p>
<p>Canada is about five hours behind London time. We flew across the Atlantic in just thirteen flying hours, so we should have arrived at about ten o'clock the next morning. But looking out the window, it was still pitch black. It turned out that it was only five o'clock, and the journey had more hours to it. Getting off the plane, the earth was completely covered in snow, and the snow was still falling continuously. Taking the first taste of the North American cold wind, it was so sharp and fierce that it felt like my ears were about to be cut off. But as soon as I entered the room, it was spring everywhere, warm and lovely.</p>
<p>Coming to Canada was an unexpected detour for me. I didn't originally plan to do any sightseeing. In particular, the situation in America is different from that in Europe. There is nothing to say about history and local customs, but the streets are neat and the architecture has also learned from the American style. Skyscrapers are everywhere, and this scene is still full of novelty and progress. Montreal has more than one million people and is the largest city in Canada, belonging to Quebec, a wealthy and quiet place. That day, we entered the city at about eight o'clock. Under the heavy snow, suburban trams were carrying passengers to the office, and the crowds on the street were still quite crowded. Due to historical reasons, the French people here account for about 60 percent. Several large department stores and shops are mostly opened by French merchants, and the shops all have French-speaking clerks. Government documents are also mostly written in both English and French. Therefore, regardless of the degree, similar to Europe, an average person is speaking more than two languages to cope with today's world.</p>
<p>It is generally said that the cost of living in Canada is lower than in the United States, because at least in terms of currency, it is a ten percent discount. Other products are also more affordable. After my trial, it is indeed true, but it seems that it cannot be generalized. For example, leather shoes are still cheaper in the United States. Arrow shirts sell for two dollars and fifty cents in New York, but cost two dollars and seventy cents in Canada. A haircut costs one dollar and sixty cents. Eating breakfast can easily exceed one dollar. This standard is not too fair either. Canada's relationship with Britain is, of course, the closest, and the economy is naturally more integrated, so there are many British goods here. What could not be bought in the British mainland has actually been transported here.</p>
<h3>Tears Stain My Clothes as I Gaze at My Hometown</h3>
<p>Because the reporter had other duties, he only stayed in Yangzhou for two days. He stole some time to go to "Fuchun Tea Shop" to taste the famous Yangzhou Dim Sum, Thousand-Layer Oil Cake, and Emerald Shaomai, which are indeed unique. The leisurely habit of the local people of "皮包水 in the morning and 水包皮 in the afternoon" has not changed due to the police and fear. Perhaps they all feel that righteousness can overcome evil flames, and light can drive away darkness? It is a pity that time was too short to 放棹 on Slender West Lake. Now, looking at Pingshuitang and Guanyin Mountain from afar, I am even more fascinated. The reporter has specially appended the "Song of the Refugees" of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Association here:</p>
<p>"The north wind rises, the cold frost descends, the yellow leaves fall, the grass withers, enduring hunger and cold, drifting east and west, gazing at my hometown, tears stain my clothes!" Readers! I wonder what your feelings are? Note: The above section is only one part of the whole song. From this, one can imagine the depth of suffering in various districts of Yangzhou.

<h3>The Impact of Scientific Progress on the Concept of War</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zengjue</p>
<p>Atomic bombs are constantly improving, and atomic energy</p>
<p>Can be a blessing or a curse.</p>
<p>The year 1945 was not only a year of victory but also a year that ushered in a new era for the scientific community. On August 6 of the same year, US Secretary of War Stimson announced: "On July 16, 1945, the new atomic bomb was first tested in New Mexico, USA, and conducted in the rain. The bomb rapidly vaporized in a steel tower, and the thick smoke rushed into the stratosphere, causing a storm that shook windows two hundred and fifty air miles away. The firelight was clearly visible three miles away. Two people were knocked down by a kind of gravity 10,000 yards from the steel tower. Instantly, clouds of various colors shot straight into the sky, reaching 40,000 feet..." From this series of figures, one can see the unparalleled power unleashed by this new weapon, the energy of the atom, which represents a fundamental force in the universe. This fact not only illustrates the emergence of an unprecedented new weapon but also opens a new era in human science. Furthermore, the headquarters of the U.S. Army Strategic Air Forces announced on the 8th: "A Superfortress dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 5, resulting in 60% of the city being destroyed." General Spaatz announced on August 10: "A second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki at noon today by a Superfortress. This bomb is an improved version, easier to manufacture, and can produce greater explosive power. This bomb was dropped on the industrial center of Nagasaki. Within twelve hours of the atomic bomb being dropped, the entire city of Nagasaki was engulfed in flames. The smoke obscured the sky, even visible to pilots two hundred miles away. The bomber pilots reported that black smoke rose from the ground like a fountain, forming an umbrella-shaped fog cover reaching 20,000 feet. Physicists believe this black smoke is condensed from fragments of the underground Mitsubishi Steel and Arms factories in Japan. At the same time, scientists, based on this observation, declared that with the advent of this second atomic bomb, the first atomic bomb – the one dropped on Hiroshima – had become an antique." In these few short paragraphs, it can be seen that the atomic bomb is constantly evolving. Mankind's ability to control atomic energy is progressing. Today is more advanced than yesterday. Tomorrow will be even more advanced than today. This progress is faster than the progress of other sciences! Whether it brings disaster or blessing depends on how we use atomic energy. This is a new stage in human history.</p>
<p>Two: Offense is More Important Than Defense, Industry is More Important Than the Military</p>
<p>In the history of World War I, British military historian Major General J.F.C. Fuller wrote: "God grants victory to the greater industry, not to the greatest military." This statement was further confirmed in World War II. The victory of the Allied Nations must be attributed to material superiority and the accelerated mass production of the United States. It is necessary to have not only "superior quality" but also "large quantity." After the defeated Germany was inspected by experts sent by the Allied nations, they found that its weapons were not lacking in quality, but its output was insufficient. Therefore, the primary condition for national defense is not only to have superior scientific research capabilities but also to have superior mass production conditions. In other words, it is necessary to have industrial production that emphasizes both "quality and quantity." In the final act of this war, the atomic bomb indeed prevailed, but the German missiles (rockets) were also powerful new weapons. These two new weapons clearly indicate to us that "offense is more important than defense." If we can use atomic bombs to strike the enemy first, while massively destroying their cities, we may defeat the enemy in a matter of tens of hours or even minutes. The rockets we know now are only in their initial stages, with inaccurate aiming and insufficient range. However, science is likely to improve their accuracy and range, or perhaps enable rockets to surpass the navy. At the same time, atomic bombs are also constantly being improved, possibly to the point of precise detonation timing. Furthermore, it is very likely that atomic bombs will be mounted on rockets, aimed at the enemy's important cities, and launched in unison as a preemptive strike, annihilating the enemy and achieving victory in an extremely short period. U.S. military researcher Wanson Baldwin has imagined that future wars may become highly mechanized "Push Button Wars," where rockets and atomic bombs can be launched with the push of a button from thousands of miles away, killing the enemy and achieving results.</p>
<p>Three: The Status of Facsimile Transmission and Radar, The Status of Pilots and Troops</p>
<p>Some say that this was the last time fighter pilots were used in combat. U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff H.H. Arnold has also made this statement. This is because scientific progress has made it possible for radio to replace pilots in piloting aircraft, and for facsimile telegraphs, televisions, and radar to replace our eyes and ears. During World War II, aircraft used photography to scout enemy positions, and images taken on board could be transmitted back to the rear by facsimile transmission during flight breaks. The use of radar allowed for super-visual reconnaissance. Enemy aircraft hundreds of miles away, beyond our visual range, could be projected onto the screen of a reconnaissance device's cathode ray tube. If radar were placed on an aircraft, it could detect enemy ships hundreds of miles away on the ocean by emitting and reflecting ultra-short waves, and then bomb them. Truly, no ghosts or monsters could escape detection, like the "demon-revealing mirror" described in our "Investiture of the Gods"! In future wars, although the number of pilots may be reduced, with radio replacing pilots or long-range rockets replacing air raids, air personnel will still be needed to complete other special missions. Excellent pilots still have their place because we have not yet invented machines that can completely replace the human brain! In addition, the position of ground troops is also worth our attention. Because the aforementioned machines cannot replace the human brain, and any bombing has its shortcomings, ground troops still have their mission. Rockets, automatic aircraft, and atomic bombs can slaughter, destroy, and devastate anything on the ground, but they are passive rather than active. They can destroy but cannot occupy, threaten but cannot organize. Therefore, airborne troops and paratroopers will still be needed in the future. However, the training of future troops may need to focus on special skills for underground warfare. Our defense work must be in the underground, as Sun Tzu said, "Those skilled in war conceal themselves under the ninefold earth." However, whether it is possible to ensure safety underground remains a question.</p>
<p>Four: Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, the rapid progress of science has not only changed future tactics but also changed strategy. High mountains, great rivers, and geographical obstacles have lost their significant military importance, and the army, navy, and air force have been relegated to the second tier of military power. At the same time, it has also changed our concept of building cities. Industrial construction must tend towards dispersal or concealment deep underground. Society and economic life will have similar reforms. All of this is due to the new factors created by the unparalleled power of the atomic bomb. However, perhaps the ferocity of the atomic bomb will enable the world to maintain peace and prevent the easy outbreak of inhumane wars. In other words, the ferocity of war may promote the improvement of human morality. The tragedy of scientific killing may improve the entire world's political diplomacy, gradually putting it on track to avoid the tragedy of human self-destruction. At the same time, the moral responsibility of scientists is to ensure that the great atomic energy not only does not harm humanity but also can be applied to industry to benefit humanity!</p>

<h3>Rumors Unconfirmed, Gold Notes All Recovered Well, Trading of New Hong Kong Dollars Slightly Reduced</h3>
<p>Shanghai Red (烚赤) gradually stabilized yesterday, after initial weakness. In the securities market, accumulated funds after profit-taking, and strong players absorbed slightly. Although short sellers were still struggling, they were quite erratic in the middle of the day, but still trended upward in the afternoon. Opening in the morning continued the momentum from the previous day, retreating from 8.25 million to 8.18 million after unconfirmed rumors about U.S. dollars. As factories absorbed, the gold market triggered a wave of arbitrage buying, gradually pulling up. Some speculative funds from the securities sector came to embellish, and the overall situation stabilized, hovering around 8.35 million at noon. In the afternoon, major players covered their short positions, and the market tended to prosper in a peaceful state, finally rising above 8.5 million, recovering 225,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments in silver shops were priced at 90,000, silver bullion at 700 yuan. Silver dollars, due to the ceasefire between the Nationalists and Communists, saw weakened sales from the Jiangbei (江北) region, retreating to around 445 yuan. Gambling spreads were about seven to ten cents. Lacking variation.</p>
<p>The rumors about U.S. dollars that circulated the previous day could not be confirmed, but people felt bored. Therefore, the market still hovered at a low price from the previous close at the opening. Later, with factories slightly absorbing, it gradually recovered well to above 1,400 yuan. The gold market gradually became active, and U.S. dollars also responded remotely due to arbitrage buying. It was even more stable in the afternoon, recovering 50 yuan compared to the previous close. Old Hong Kong dollars were stagnant, with no one paying attention. Although the final result was slightly better than the previous day by 5 yuan, it was at the selling price. New Hong Kong dollars were once raised to 90 yuan at the opening, but because the Guang (廣) region provided goods from 1937, and there were rumors that a ship would arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, the buying interest slightly faded, falling below 85. The final result was average.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Dropped in Popularity and Rose in Cold Markets, Chinese Stocks Weaker Initially and Stronger Later, Speculative Funds Again Massively Shifted to Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Public bonds were still stable initially, but the funds in the hands of those in the industry were limited, and they lacked the strength to pull up. Therefore, Grade C bonds saw a high price of 1,350 yuan before falling downstream. Many long holders also took advantage of the situation to sell. Other miscellaneous brands (另　雜牌) were used to make a net profit on the difference. The market showed a phenomenon of popular bonds dropping and unpopular bonds rising. Grade C finally hovered around the 1,300 yuan mark, while Grade D bonds rose to above the 1,000 yuan mark, exceeding the Grade E bonds, which were usually considered popular, by more than ten yuan. The afternoon close showed that Grades A and B rose by 100 yuan, Grade D by 120 yuan, Grade E by 75 yuan, and Grade C had no progress.</p>
<p>The Chinese stock market situation was still extremely chaotic. Many retail investors took the opportunity to sell short. Occasionally, a few short positions were excessive, and they were forced to cover their short positions at the close. Therefore, although it was weak in the middle of the day, with Yong Yarn (永紗) falling to 1,180 yuan, Mei Ya (美亞) to 865 yuan, Xin Guang (新光) within 70 yuan, Jing Fu (景福) to 58 yuan, and Qin Xing (勤興) to 56 yuan, the foreign stock market was surprisingly strong at this time. Influenced by this, many sold off foreign stocks and re-entered, stabilizing after the weakness. As short sellers eagerly covered their positions at noon, buying interest rekindled and became fierce again. The afternoon close was all at high prices. Compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn rose by 180 yuan, Mei Ya by 75 yuan, and the "Three Small Hot" stocks each rose by 7 yuan to 8.5 yuan. Bidding continued to rise in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were sought after by the remaining funds of the silver and money industry and the profits of the yarn and securities sectors. Half of it was hyped up. Retail investors followed suit. Foreign stocks had been frozen for a long time, and there were few chips. All stocks rose. Jardine Matheson (會德豐) once stood above the 10,000 yuan mark for a long time. Steel industry stocks were the most popular due to their small price and the sound of resumption of work, and they rose by another 10% to 20%. Small stocks and unpopular stocks had more buyers.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rose and Then Fell, Edible Oil and Soybeans Remained Active</h3>
<p>The rice situation in the northern market turned sluggish and returned to a weak state. Southern glutinous rice and early indica rice fell by 500 to 600 yuan. Northern glutinous rice also fell by over 200 yuan. Early season indica and Du indica both fell by 200 to 300 yuan. White rice fell by 200 to 300 yuan. Only Yang indica and Hidden Origin (陰元) goods were scarce and still strong. Flour was sluggish, with prices falling by 200 to 300 yuan. In the edible oil market, the Ningbo (甬) traders continued to ship out, and retail sales on the street were also active, rising by another 2,000 yuan. Soybeans were also active, continuing to rise by 100 to 200 yuan. Soybean cake continued to fall by 100 yuan. Wine prices were similar, and raw peanuts remained firm.</p>
<h3>Rayon Continues to Rise, The Future of Silk Factories is Dim</h3>
<p>The rally in rayon was very strong last Sunday. Yesterday, the price of 20-count rayon opened at 910,000 yuan at the Tianqiao (天橋) market and closed at 960,000 yuan. The price continued to trade at 965,000 yuan in the afternoon, which was 60,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Actual demand was very strong, and there was no supply available, resulting in a steady rise. The price of 150-count rayon has exceeded the million-yuan mark. The hope for warehouse receipts is slim, and the distance between the price and the spot price is increasing daily. The industry was trading among themselves at 735,000 to 740,000 yuan. The factories' situation was mixed, with very little trading. The silk market was slightly higher. Mei Ya fabric was 595,000 yuan, Dacheng (大誠) checkered crepe was 1,770 yuan, and Minsheng (民生) brocade was 9,500 yuan. According to those in the industry, the cost of silk was far exceeding the selling price. Raw material prices were rising without end. Small silk factories may not be able to sustain, and production is bound to decrease in the future.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Supply Cannot Meet Demand</h3>
<p>The inventory of tea leaves in this city is currently weak, especially for high-quality fried green and baked green tea, which are almost sold out. Recently, the Tianjin (天津) traders have been very active, so everyone is lamenting that supply cannot meet demand. The market is becoming more aggressive, and prices rose again yesterday, with a general increase day by day. Other varieties are also following the firm market under the continued absorption by actual buyers. Although prices have not soared, they are generally stable with the market.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market as Solid as Ever</h3>
<p>Yesterday, inland traders purchased cotton yarn. Cotton mills also absorbed well, so the price of 20-count ordinary brand and 16-count yarn rose by 20,000 yuan. The price of Special Double Horse brand was very ordinary, still trading between 740,000 and 750,000 yuan. The price of fine yarn and double-strand yarn was lower by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan compared to the previous day because the Textile Construction Company supplied them steadily. People were hesitant, and there was a sense of being wary of the high price. This is because, in terms of the price index, the yarn multiple is higher than other commodities.</p>
<h3>Coal Lumps Stable, Small Coal Sales are Strong</h3>
<p>White coal lumps remain stable, while white small coal sales are strong because the market price of white small coal is cheaper compared to coal lumps. Bituminous coal lumps continued their previous momentum and were still strong. Bituminous coal dust once shouted a high price, but because factory sales were sluggish, and there was a lack of opinion from the main buyers, it eventually returned to a stable price.</p>
<h3>Thick White Iron Sheet Sales are Strong, Cement Spot Goods are Very Popular</h3>
<p>The sales of flat white iron sheets have expanded again, especially for 24-gauge and 26-gauge thick sheets. Customer traders purchased and absorbed them very well, and more than a thousand loads were transported. Currently, traders who are dismantling goods charge about 80,000 yuan per group.</p>
<p>In recent days, cement factories have had very little output due to the lack of large quantities of fuel supply. Orders for more than a hundred bags have been delayed. Therefore, the spot market is more popular than before, with each bag costing 4,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Merchants Request Modification of Overseas Chinese Remittance Rate</h3>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, November 11] Merchants here are requesting to revise the remittance rate for overseas Chinese remittances to China. Before the war, the number of remittances reached millions of US dollars annually. The current remittance rate is US$1 for 500 legal currency, causing many overseas Chinese to prefer remitting to Hong Kong, converting to legal currency, in order to avoid calculating at the official price. After transferring through Hong Kong, they can get 800 more legal currency, and if they convert through the black market, they can get 1,300 more legal currency. Guangzhou merchants believe that if the government maintains the old exchange rate, it will lose a great opportunity to obtain US dollar reserves.</p>

<h3>Yi Chang &amp; Co. Opens Ordering for Arrow Shirts</h3>
<p>It is rumored that imported Arrow shirts will soon be available in Shanghai. Yi Chang &amp; Co. and others have now begun pre-sales. Many major companies and department stores are ordering. The price per dozen is 14.5, 16.5, and 18.5 yuan, plus 20% import and export tax, settled in U.S. dollars. The arrival of these goods will inevitably hit domestic shirts.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Guiyang Wheel Transports Large Quantities of Bananas and Oranges</h3>
<p>Freight transport on the Shanghai-Ningbo (滬甬) line has been sluggish recently. Yesterday, the Jiangfeng (江鳳) Wheel arrived in Shanghai from the rain, with only 300+ pieces of cargo, including 45 pieces of Yuyao (餘姚) flowers. The Taikoo Guiyang Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday, carrying 1,600+ pieces of bananas, 300+ pieces of oranges, and 400 pieces of sunflower fans. The Jianghan (江漢) Wheel will sail to Hankou (漢) today, towing an iron barge loaded with 600 tons of coal.</p>
<h3>Commercial Information Summary</h3>
<p>Dyes: It is heard that a major American trading company has shipped a large quantity of dyes, such as 400-pound drums of Fishing Brand, in very large quantities. Also, with the New Year approaching, the custom of customer traders seeking goods has subsided, and transactions are rare.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: Previously, due to customer traders buying goods, the Executive Yuan issued an order to the Jianghai (江海) Customs to prohibit exports, so they were transferred to ports such as Macau and Guangzhou Bay. Dyed goods from the Sichuan (川) traders and Bengbu (蚌埠) traders are in great demand, with blue cloth being the most popular, and the market is gradually rising again.</p>
<p>Sugar: The sugar market is increasingly tight. Customer traders' absorption remains hot, creating a situation where coarse sugar, military white, and rock candy are not available in the market.</p>
<p>Caustic Soda: Sales are very active, and the market continues to rise. Soda ash prices have fallen slightly because it is said that Customs has released some. Butter inventory is lacking, and the selling price is trending upward.</p>
<h3>Education and Sports: Abolishing Unequal Education System, Taiwan Province Sets New Curriculum, Provisional Textbooks for Elementary and Middle Schools throughout the Province Have Been Printed and Distributed to Schools for Trial Teaching</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, November 11] During the period of Japanese rule in the province, discriminatory education was implemented. National schools for Japanese children used the No. 1 curriculum, schools for Taiwanese children used the No. 2 curriculum, and schools where Taiwanese and Gaoshan (高砂) tribes studied together used the No. 3 curriculum. This unequal education system has been abolished by the authorities, and a new curriculum has been formulated in accordance with central regulations and taking into account the actual situation in the province, and printed and distributed to schools for trial implementation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hebei, November 11] At the beginning of the province's recovery, the situation was special. The Provincial Department of Education has specially compiled provisional Chinese language textbooks for national schools, with 50 lessons in Volume A for grades 1, 2, and 3, and 50 lessons in Volume B for grades 4, 5, and 6. A provisional history textbook with 50 lessons is provided for grades 4, 5, and 6. The above textbooks have been mimeographed and distributed to national schools throughout the province for trial teaching, before being formally printed and distributed. Provisional Chinese language and history textbooks for middle schools have all been compiled and will be printed and distributed to middle schools for trial teaching in the coming days.</p>

<p>Today's Football League: Jewish vs. British Navy, Qingbai Team Takes to the Field for the Second Time, Meeting the Soviet Team at Jiaozhou Park</p>
<p>Today's football league will have nine matches in three groups, A, B, and C, all played at Jiaozhou Park and Hongkou Public Garden. Among them, the Jewish team will play against the British Navy at Jiaozhou Park at 10:00 AM. The Jewish team defeated the Qingbai team last week and is in great momentum. The British Navy has assembled the elite from various ships, so their strength is undoubtedly not to be underestimated. Therefore, both sides will surely engage in a fierce battle. At 2:30 PM, the Qingbai team will take to the field for the second time, facing the Soviet team. The Qingbai team unfortunately lost to the Jewish team in their first match last week, while the Soviet team has also lost once. Logically speaking, the Qingbai team should be able to win. It is also rumored that the three musketeers of Qingbai, Gao Baozheng, Fei Chunhua, and Li Yichen, are determined to help out, and the lineup is more complete than last week, so winning against the Soviet team should not be a problem. The schedule for today is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jewish vs. British Navy (Group A) 10:00 AM Jiaozhou Park</p>
<p>Qingbai vs. Soviet (Group A) 2:30 PM Jiaozhou Park</p>

<h3>Korean僑 Fight Vigorously; Yesterday Drew with Italian僑 Team; Score was One to One</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon's football league, there was a Group A match at Jiaozhou Park at 2:30 PM. The Italian僑 team was making its first appearance, which attracted a lot of attention from the audience, making the stadium quite lively. The result of the match was a one-to-one draw, which was quite unexpected. The first half ended one-to-one, and no goals were scored in the second half. The Korean僑 team's bravery and effort were also significant. The Italian僑 team was clearly out of practice, and there was an obvious disconnect, otherwise, they should have been able to defeat the Korean僑 team.</p>
<p>After the start of the match, the Korean僑 team fought bravely, and the Italian僑 team seemed to have difficulty defending in a hurry. In the 13th minute, the Korean僑 team had a corner kick opportunity, which was taken by Hong Shengyu on the right wing. The landing point was very good, and Song Xingxie jumped up and headed the ball. McNitti jumped up a step late, and the ball went into the net. After the Italian僑 team conceded a goal, they had to put in more effort. Two minutes later, Villa shot from the right corner, hit the goalpost, and bounced back. Tekni took advantage of the situation and kicked the ball straight into the net. The first half ended one-to-one, with no winner decided. In the second half, the Italian僑 team launched a fierce offensive, but unfortunately, their luck was not good. The Korean僑 team also did not let up. Until the end of the match, neither side scored, and the game ended in a one-to-one draw.</p>

<h3>Tangshan Institute of Technology in the Past Eight Years</h3>
<p>—Xiao Jin</p>
<p>Tangshan Institute of Technology is a department of Jiaotong University, located in Tangshan on the Beining Railway before the war, where the coal mines are located. Perhaps because it only offers two departments, civil engineering and mining and metallurgy, the general public is very unfamiliar with it, but it is very famous in our country's railway, highway, and other national defense engineering departments. It was founded in the 31st year of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty and has been around for 41 years. In these long years, in an environment that neglected engineering education, Tangshan Institute of Technology has always painstakingly cultivated thousands of talents, giving new arteries to ancient China!</p>
<p>This is only a report on the experiences of Tangshan Institute of Technology in the past eight years since the war. As for the situation before the war, it has been omitted due to space constraints.</p>
<p>Beginning the Relocation from Shanghai to Hunan</p>
<p>When the bugle call of the War of Resistance against Japan sounded from Donggou Bridge, Tangshan Institute of Technology was the first to encounter disaster. In a hurry, nothing was rescued. They went to Shanghai and stayed with the main campus for a few months. However, the great cause of the War of Resistance against Japan was a long-term one. Under the call of the leader, Tangshan Institute of Technology relocated inland regardless of everything. A week after the fall of Nanjing, with the assistance of alumni, classes were resumed in Xiangtan, Hunan [a small town ninety li south of Changsha]. At that time, the Ministry of Education did not provide funding, and the professors were all voluntary. The students also endured all the difficulties and worked with the school in harmony to overcome the difficult times. Under the leadership of President Mao Yisheng, with only 600 yuan donated by alumni each month, Tangshan Institute of Technology was reborn and finally took on the new mission entrusted by the War of Resistance, cultivating a large number of engineering talents to serve the motherland and open up the source of activities for the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>The Great Fire of Changsha Forced the Move to Yangjiatan</p>
<p>The Great Fire of Changsha forced Tangshan Institute of Technology to move to Yangjiatan. That was a small village, and this was only a temporary solution. At the same time, the enemy's claws were pressing on us, so in the winter of the 27th year, the plan to move west to Kunming was decided. All the teachers and students of the institute formed more than a dozen units and embarked on the westward journey in batches. In Guilin, they encountered the enemy's bombing again, and the students' luggage and the school's instruments and books were all lost. However, the plan to move west was still not abandoned, and the teachers and students moved forward to Kunming step by step. At that time, the "Development of the Great Southwest" plan was being implemented, and Guizhou became the center of the Great Southwest. Tangshan Institute of Technology encountered this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and honorably took on the task of guiding higher education in Guizhou, stopping in Pingyue County, more than a hundred kilometers east of Guiyang.</p>
<p>Developing the Southwest and Entering Pingyue</p>
<p>Pingyue was a desolate mountain town with only a hundred households, and food depended entirely on external aid. In this environment, the teachers and students of Tangshan Institute of Technology silently and diligently developed this primitive mountain town. After more than six years of cultivation, the face of the mountain town changed. Junior high schools and high schools were established one after another, and the cultural level of the people improved a lot. A small highway stretched tortuously through the mountains to Machangping [a large station one hundred kilometers east of Guiyang] and connected to the Southwest Highway.</p>
<p>In Pingyue, Tangshan Institute of Technology still maintained the two-department system. At this time, the Railway Management College of Jiaotong University in Peiping (which had moved from Yangjiatan with Tangshan Institute of Technology) was also in Pingyue. The two institutes of Tangshan and Peiping became one, and the Ministry of Education also merged the two institutes and renamed them "Guizhou Branch of Jiaotong University." The first president was Mr. Hu Boyuan.</p>
<p>Instruments and books are the second life of a school, especially for engineering. Tangshan Institute of Technology moved inland empty-handed and was bombed by enemy planes on the way. It can be said that there was not a single instrument or a single book. Under the circumstances of the War of Resistance, it was not easy to purchase from the outside, so a donation campaign was launched. With the care of alumni, good results were obtained. At the same time, the school also tried to purchase some, so although it was not as complete as before the war, it was enough for learning purposes.</p>
<p>In mid-November of the 33rd year, the defense of "Hunan and Guangxi" ended like lightning. When the enemy's iron hooves reached Dushan, Tangshan Institute of Technology stopped classes in a hurry. All the teachers and students had no choice but to abandon their luggage and flee in panic. In a situation where the war was losing ground and the front and rear were in chaos, the teachers and students of Tangshan Institute of Technology threw away their luggage again and again and embarked on the 500-kilometer Sichuan-Guizhou Road. Under the threat of wind and snow and the warm care of alumni, they arrived in Chongqing, and more than 500 displaced hearts temporarily settled down. "Everything for the War of Resistance," "Everything for the Motherland," what do these sufferings and these tribulations count for!</p>
<p>Finding School Buildings in Dingjia'ao</p>
<p>When Professor Luo, who had been teaching for more than 30 years, escaped from Pingyue and arrived in Chongqing, the alumni association held a welcome party and discussed the issue of resuming classes. After more than a month of running around, with the help of alumni in various ways, school buildings were found in Dingjia'ao Town, on the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, one hundred kilometers west of Chongqing. It was the old site of the Transportation Technology Personnel Training Institute of the Ministry of Transportation. Although it was not as spacious as the school buildings in Pingyue, it was barely usable. However, everything that had been done in Pingyue for eight years was in vain. Although some instruments and books were shipped out later, it could not heal this huge wound.</p>
<p>Today's Tangshan Institute of Technology is still at the pre-war level. All the professors are old, and there are many who have been teaching for 30 or 20 years. The teaching standards are still the same as before the war. However, the number of students has doubled, and there are now more than 400 people. The Peiping Railway Management College, which shared hardships with it, also maintained the pre-war standards. Under the name of "Guizhou Branch of Jiaotong University," it is cultivating talents for national construction in the spirit of forty years of tradition.</p>
<p>Finally, to end this article, I will quote Dr. Mao Yisheng's words at the celebration of the resumption of school in Xiangtan on December 15 last year:</p>
<p>"The fate of our Tangshan Institute of Technology in the past eight years has been cyclical. Eight years ago, we fell from the mountain (Tangshan) into the pond (Xiangtan), and then climbed from the pond to the beach (Yangjiatan), and from the beach to the plain (Pingyue). Now we have entered the waterless gully (Dingjia'ao), but in May next year, we can return to our old home."</p>
<p>Indeed, Tangshan Institute of Technology, like the motherland, has also been revived. According to President Gu Yisun, the future development of Tangshan Institute of Technology is to become a perfect independent college, and to add a mechanical and electrical engineering department to meet the needs of the new Chinese construction.</p>

<h3>Stop Conflicts and Restore Transportation; Mayor Qian Ordered Obedience and Telegraphed Chairman to Report on Implementation</h3>
<p>Mayor Qian of this city recently received a telegram from Chairman Chiang stating, "Regarding the cessation of conflict and the restoration of traffic, an order has been issued (full text appears on the first page of this newspaper on the 11th). It is essential to comply strictly and not to deviate." Another telegram was received on the 11th stating, "Zizheng's telegram has been received, and it is hoped that you will report on the implementation." Mayor Qian immediately ordered his subordinates to comply strictly and replied to the Chairman with a telegram, the content of which stated, "Your telegram has been received with respect. Upon investigation, all garrison troops within this city and the garrison area are stationed at locations specified by the Garrison Headquarters, and the security is good, with no incidents of conflict. As for the traffic within the city, it has also returned to normal. In addition to ordering strict compliance by subordinates, this telegram is respectfully reported."</p>
<h3>Bao Jing'an Arrives in Shanghai to Welcome Patterson</h3>
<p>U.S. Secretary of War Patterson, who left the eastern United States at the end of last month, is currently in Tokyo. It is now heard that Mr. Patterson will arrive in Shanghai within days, and Bao Jing'an, the director of the Foreign Affairs Department of the Nanjing Army Headquarters, has been ordered to go to Shanghai on the 12th to welcome him.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to U.S. military sources: U.S. Secretary of War Patterson has rescheduled his arrival in Shanghai for next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Wei Daoming Returns Home to Report on His Duties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to authoritative American sources in this city, Wei Daoming, our ambassador to the United States, who will arrive in Shanghai next Monday, may be assigned to another position after returning home to report on his duties. It is said that Mr. Wei will not return to Washington, and there is no news of a successor.</p>
<h3>The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is Selling Flour</h3>
<p>The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration suddenly took emergency steps yesterday to stabilize the market price of flour in this city. In the morning, the Administration's finance department sent personnel to the Municipal Grain Association to publicly sell 10,000 bags of American wheat flour on the market. The bid was 3,700 yuan per bag, and a public notice was posted, which read: "This Administration currently has 10,000 bags of No. 2 American wheat flour for sale at a price of 3,700 yuan per bag. Those who wish to purchase are requested to go to the offices of the Renji Road Fufeng and Fuxin factories before 2:00 PM today to complete the procedures. This notice is hereby given." It is understood that the Administration began processing the fourth phase of flour sales from the 11th. After four days of applying for registration, and widely distributing to large flatbread and American bread stalls, as of yesterday, more than 15,000 application forms had been issued. While processing the application procedures, an investigation was also initiated. Anyone with a business license and a guarantor was immediately issued a purchase certificate by the investigator on the spot, and the applicant could use the certificate to pay for the goods when they were sold on the 17th. Therefore, the sales of flour in the market of this city gradually became sluggish, and the market price should have temporarily stabilized and would not rise immediately. However, at this time, the demand from out-of-town clients in Qingdao, Taiwan, Fuzhou, and Hankou became stronger, and the market price not only did not fall but rose by 500 to 600 yuan compared to last week. The price of No. 1 flour even exceeded 4,000 yuan. Therefore, in order to stabilize the price of flour, the Administration resolutely sold it publicly yesterday. It is also understood that purchasers must complete the purchase procedures before 2:00 PM yesterday, otherwise, the public notice will not be bound by the bid price. This type of sale is not periodic.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Vice Minister Yan Shenyu Goes to Wuxi to Inspect</h3>
<p>In order to urge the recovery of enemy and puppet organizations in the Beijing-Shanghai area, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry sent Administrative Vice Minister Yan Shenyu to Shanghai to supervise. Mr. Yan flew to Shanghai from Chongqing on the 4th and has been inspecting farms, pastures, aquatic products, and silk-related organizations for several days, and has been very busy. He also convened a symposium with fishery and aquatic product leaders on the 9th and held a talk with the directors and supervisors of the China Silk Company on the 10th. All issues have been resolved in an orderly manner. It is heard that the Ministry's farms in Shanghai that have been taken over have been reorganized into the Shanghai Experimental Economic Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Zhang Binchen has been appointed as the farm manager, and Zhang Jizhi as the deputy farm manager. The Shanghai Fish Market will be officially restored soon, and a general manager and deputy manager will be elected. The China Aquatic Products Company will also formally conduct business based on the regulations passed by the Executive Yuan and produce supervisors. The Central Plant Protection Machinery Factory is also preparing to move to Shanghai. As for the China Silk Company, which is jointly operated by the Ministry and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the takeover has been completed, and Chairman Zhou has first hired Ge Jingzhong as the acting general manager to begin operations, purchasing silkworm eggs and replenishing mulberry seedlings. After completing his official duties, Mr. Yan went to Wuxi with Special Envoy Peter Zuoqiong yesterday morning to inspect the Ministry's agricultural tool manufacturing plant in Wuxi. He will go to Beijing soon and return to Chongqing via that route.</p>
<h3>Accusations of Treason and Collaboration: Xue Jingdao and Others on Trial</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) This morning, the Special Criminal Court of the High Court continued to hear two cases of treason. First, Judge Zhu Zonghai ascended to the court. The defendant, Xue Jingdao, a native of Changzhou, 32 years old, once served as a company commander under Shi Yaoming, a puppet army officer in Yixing. Later, he joined the New Fourth Army and reported Zhang Tao, a member of our guerrilla team, and Ding Zixi, a member of the Kuomintang, and Zhang was arrested and died as a result. Therefore, Xue Jingdao's uncle, Jing Zhen, accused him of endangering the Republic of China. Xue was arrested in Shanghai, but Xue denied reporting Zhang and Ding in court, claiming that his uncle had falsely accused him out of personal revenge. Because the accuser Xue Zhen did not arrive, the court's discussion of the case is still under investigation, and the hearing will be rescheduled.</p>
<p>Next, Presiding Judge Liu Yugui interrogated Zhang Bingheng, the owner of Fengtai Copper and Tin Shop on Beijing Road, and his partner Zhang Yizhi. Zhang Bingheng, a native of Nanjing, 32 years old, seized the opportunity during the period of darkness to collect copper coins and hardware materials for the enemy, and then took a concubine and bought real estate with 20 gold bars last year, living a comfortable life. After the victory, the police station reported the case, and Zhang was arrested and transferred to the court. Yesterday, the judicial officer of the Huangpu Branch Bureau also came to the court to report on the handling process, but Zhang argued that he had no dealings with Japanese businessmen. The court immediately wanted to examine the store's account books, but Zhang claimed that the account books were kept by the accountant, who had gone to Nanjing and whose address was unknown. At this point, the presiding judge ordered a recess for further inquiry, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Also, there will be no hearing today. A large number of treason cases will be heard tomorrow. It is planned to hear Ling Guangyan and Xue Youwen and others at 9:00 AM, sentence Xu Xing and hear Gu You's case at 2:00 PM, and hear Jiang Yougen, Zuo Ming and others at 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>A Portion of the Air Force Arrives in Shanghai, Waiting for Ships to Go to the United States for Training</h3>
<p>[News] Jiang Yifu, commander of the Third Air Force District, arrived here from Hangzhou a few days ago. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from this newspaper visited him. According to him, there are currently 480 personnel from the Air Force combat unit here, who will soon be sent to various locations on the West Coast of the United States for training, studying bombing and other tactics. The Air Force personnel going abroad this time have all participated in air battles in various places and are currently undergoing physical examinations, injections, and other preparations. Once the U.S. military has completed the ship arrangements, they can depart. In addition, other technical personnel studying mechanics, radio, etc., will also arrive here one after another and transfer to the United States for training. According to Mr. Jiang, the Hangzhou Air Force Military Academy will be established soon.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Third District Command has been set up in Shanghai. The main task of the department is air transportation and the transportation of materials. In addition, it is also responsible for taking over enemy equipment and transporting surplus materials from U.S. military outposts. It is heard that the takeover of enemy equipment in Hangzhou has been completed and the takeover affairs in the six districts of the city are being handled.</p>
<h3>Koreans Forcibly Conscript Chinese Laborers, Detained by Military Police for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Li Guiyun, a Korean, in his thirties, once acted as a lackey for the Japanese under the iron heels of the Japanese, and forcibly conscripted Chinese people in Shanghai to work as coolies in Dinghai. More than two or three hundred people were deceived by him. Chen Jiafeng, an electrician, was also one of those forcibly conscripted. After arriving in Dinghai, he suffered all kinds of torture. After the victory, he came to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Chen was visiting a ball game in Jiaozhou Park when he suddenly saw Li in the stadium. He stepped forward and dragged him to the West Shanghai Military Police Branch, where he was detained to investigate his criminal evidence.</p>
<h3>Requests for Return of Real Estate for Those Who Were Not Owners During the Occupation Period</h3>
<p>During the period of the puppet organization in Shanghai during the occupation, there was an organization called the "Shanghai City Non-Resident Land and House Management Committee". All land and houses owned by citizens that were not registered with the committee were considered non-resident owners and were managed and leased by the puppet committee. At that time, the general public who followed the government inland and some people with pure thoughts were unwilling to register, or because their property certificates were deposited elsewhere and could not be registered, they were arbitrarily disposed of by the committee. Among them, there were also not a few people who relied on the power of the enemy and puppets to collude and occupy the properties. It is learned that the Municipal Land Administration Bureau is taking over these cases. In order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the owners, it has begun to clean them up. The main points of the approach are: (1) For land and houses that were managed and leased by the puppet committee, the original owners who have not yet recovered their property rights should submit accurate property documents to the Land Administration Bureau to apply for their return. (2) All contracts for land and houses leased from the puppet committee are invalid. The original lessees should submit evidence to the Land Administration Bureau to apply for leasing procedures within one month. If the deadline is exceeded, the Bureau will take back the leased property and issue another public notice to solicit leases. (3) If the original owner applies for the return of a lease contract and is approved, it will be revoked immediately, and the lessee should return the leased property within two months. This matter concerns the vital interests of each owner and lessee, and they should apply separately to avoid delays.</p>
<h3>Marshal Ma's Greatest Success in China: Achieving a Cessation of Conflict; General Wedemeyer Receives Reporters Yesterday; The New Sixth Army to Depart from Shanghai to the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] General Wedemeyer declared at a reception for reporters yesterday morning: "The 'Truce Agreement' established in Chongqing is the greatest achievement of Marshal Marshall's work in China after his arrival." Marshal Ma has handled various issues with impartiality and has gained the trust of people from all parties in Chongqing. Mr. Wei also stated: "The New Sixth Army will begin transporting from Shanghai to the Northeast on the 16th of this month. A total of 26,000 troops from the New Sixth Army will go north, equipped with winter gear. After the New Sixth Army leaves, the 207th Army will come here to take over the defense."</p>
<h3>Implementing Medical and Pharmaceutical Relief: Scheduled Flat-Rate Prescription</h3>
<p>In order to implement medical and pharmaceutical relief, the Municipal Health Bureau, in addition to establishing two pharmaceutical supply offices in this city to supply medicines at flat prices, yesterday also invited major pharmacies to discuss the issue of flat-rate prescriptions and night service. Director Yu Songyun of the Health Bureau reported that he hoped that the new pharmaceutical industry would cooperate and support the widespread establishment of flat-rate prescriptions. At the same time, the work of night service will be distributed to benefit citizens. After discussion, the principle was unanimously agreed upon, and it was decided to start processing flat-rate prescriptions from the 21st.</p>
<h3>Theft of Coal from the Beipiao Coal Stack: Complex Contents</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Beipiao Coal Stack, which was taken over by the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee, was stolen twice in the middle of last month and at the beginning of this month, with a total of more than 200 tons of coal stolen. After investigation by the audit team of the association and the police bureau, the case has been solved, and the thieves have been sent to the port waterway police station and the police station for interrogation. It is learned that the contents of the case are complex and have been reported to the relevant authorities for instruction.</p>
<h3>Busy Transportation - Lack of Vehicles on Both Lines</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines have been extremely crowded with passengers since their takeover. Although there have been some improvements recently, many travelers are still unable to secure passage. Our reporter made a special investigation and found that the existing number of vehicles is less than before the war, while the number of passengers has increased. Before the war, the monthly passenger count was approximately 1.3 million, but now it is approximately 1.9 million, an increase of over 38% compared to before the war. The number of vehicles before the war was 358, but now there are only 200, a decrease of 40%. This means that the existing vehicles need to accommodate about twice as many passengers as before the war, so you can imagine how crowded it is. Recently, due to busy emergency transportation, the vehicles are even more insufficient. For example, the 23rd and 24th train's third-class passenger cars on the Beijing-Shanghai line, and the 61st and 62nd train's third and fourth-class cars on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, had to be temporarily suspended due to emergency transportation. All parties hope that the government will quickly add vehicles, such as requesting allocation from the Relief Administration, to facilitate passenger transport.</p>
<p>Increasing Ticket Offices</p>
<p>Previously, due to the limited number of ticket offices on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, passengers had to crowd to buy tickets. Now, the railway bureau has added a new ticket office inside the North Station. The ticket office has three ticket windows for first-class on the Beijing-Shanghai line, five for second and third class each, and one for first-class on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, and two each for second and third class. Currently, the North Station and China Travel Service have more than 25 ticket windows. All ticket windows sell tickets three hours before departure, so passengers do not need to rush to buy tickets. The station has also recently made the number of second-class ticket windows equal to the number of third-class ticket windows, because the number of second-class passengers has been increasing recently, and their number is not less than that of third-class passengers.</p>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai Train Derailment</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the 11th, a Beijing-Shanghai railway freight train derailed near Xinfeng Station between Zhenjiang and Danyang because the screws on the rails were removed. The locomotive was not damaged, and the loss was minor. After emergency repairs by the railway authorities, traffic was restored at 9:30 PM that afternoon. The cause of the removal is currently being investigated.</p>
<h3>Careless Fire at Nanxu Apartment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Room 301 of the Nanxu Public Apartment at No. 1843 Linsen Middle Road caught fire at approximately 7:16 AM yesterday, accidentally affecting the front building of Room 401. The fire department dispatched vehicles to the scene to put out the fire, which was quickly extinguished. The cause of the fire is unknown.</p>
<h3>General Wedemeyer Issues a Message to American Troops</h3>
<p>The following is the message issued by General Wedemeyer, Commander of the US Forces in the China Theater, to his troops: "I am well aware that you have learned from the press and radio that American troops have held demonstrations in the Philippines, Japan, Honolulu, Paris, and the United States, all with the common goal of demanding to be discharged and returned home. They believe that the war is over and that their mission is complete. I am well aware that you also hope to return to your homeland as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I am also aware that you may hold similar demonstrations and gatherings. You have never initiated such behavior, which is comforting to me. You have followed my orders and have never violated them, even though it has been difficult. The US government's recently announced China policy shows that we have unfinished work. I have tried to clarify this point in the press and radio.</p>
<p>My staff will continue to study the current situation in the China Theater. Once our government's goals are achieved, I will request that Washington send you home. We are not here to perform tasks for China, but to work for our own country's policies. President Truman also made this clear in his speech, stating that our efforts today are to maintain peace and avoid another war. You believe that we will carry out this task. I have served in the military for twenty years, and I have always shared weal and woe with the soldiers. Your ability to obey orders will be a source of pride for other naval and army units and our people."</p>
<h3>Motorized Junks Operating on North-South Shipping Routes - The Chuyuan Steamer Escapes Danger and Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Due to official duties, cargo transportation on the Yangtze River line is obstructed, and passengers can still be transported, but ships are severely lacking. The North-South shipping routes are even more lacking in ships. Recently, motorized junks have been operating, all represented by temporary shipping companies, with small transportation capacity, the largest being only 200 tons. These ships were originally used as auxiliary transportation after the destruction of Japanese naval transport ships. Now they have been taken over by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, with a total of more than 20 ships, which have been leased out separately, operating in coastal ports in Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Fujian Province, as well as Taiwan and Qingdao, with very good business. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the Yangtze River line has scheduled the Jianghua, Jiangya, and Guotai steamers to sail to Hankou next week, and the Jiangyu steamer to sail to Yichang. The Fengmao steamer, managed by Yonghe Company, is scheduled to go directly to Hankou on the 15th. The Dada steamer of Dada Company is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Hankou today and will sail to Hankou next Wednesday or Thursday for official duties. The Chuyuan steamer of the company, which was previously stranded near Yichang, has escaped danger and been launched, and will also arrive in Shanghai today for repairs in the dock. The Yongkang steamer of Sanbei Company has completed repairs and is scheduled to sail to Hankou on the 15th. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has dispatched the Haifu motorized steamer to Qingdao, scheduled to sail on the 16th. It is difficult to predict whether it can be exported on schedule. Three British ships are already operating on the Shanghai-Hong Kong line. The Yuezhou steamer left port yesterday afternoon to sail to Hong Kong. The Yongsheng steamer had more than 300 passengers and left port late at 3 PM. The Guiyang steamer arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday and is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong next Tuesday. It is said that more than 400 seats have been booked, and ticket sales will officially begin tomorrow.</p>
<p>Cause of the Minyu Incident</p>
<p>After the Minyu steamer of Minsheng Company was salvaged from the water on the evening of the other day, the cause of the sinking was found to be three holes about five inches below the black bar in front of the stern kitchen. The sizes of the three holes were: one with a diameter of two inches, and the other two smaller, with a diameter of half an inch. When the ship is empty, it is only about six inches above the water, but when the cargo is loaded, it is very close to the water surface, which can easily cause danger. As for the responsibility, it is being negotiated by the company.</p>
<h3>Establishing an Examination Center to Inspect Prostitutes' Health</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Police Bureau has been implementing the registration of brothels since the 3rd of this month, in order to review and issue licenses after they are qualified. It is reported that 650 units have been registered so far, and then the registration of prostitutes will begin. The Municipal Police Bureau will also jointly run an inspection center with the Health Bureau to strictly inspect the health of prostitutes in order to prevent the spread of diseases.</p>
<p>The city's dance halls and dancers are also undergoing registration applications. It is reported that the police bureau attaches great importance to this and will conduct strict reviews. All employees of the dance hall must be thoroughly investigated, and the personal licenses of dancers must also be restricted.</p>
<h3>Visiting Li Shizeng</h3>
<p>— Liming</p>
<p>On a cloudy morning, the reporter braved the cold and headed towards a destination in western Shanghai. In a small bungalow with a rural flavor, surrounded by sparse trees, I met Mr. Li Shizeng, a veteran of the party-state who had just flown in from the wartime capital. Mr. Li is sixty-six years old this year. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he traveled internationally to promote culture. After presenting my card and briefly stating my intentions, we began our conversation.</p>
<p>The Last Plane Leaving the Port to Go Abroad</p>
<p>Mr. Li left the country during the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident and the fierce battle of Shanghai on August 13th. He traveled around the two continents of Europe and America, first attending the International Cultural Cooperation Conference in Paris, France, and then flew back to Wuhan, the center of China's war effort at the time. When the Pacific War broke out, Mr. Li lived in Hong Kong. The fierce flames of Japanese invasion spread to the south, and he had to leave the isolated island. I remember taking the last plane to Honolulu. After staying in New York for several months, he and Dr. Hu Shi, the ambassador to the United States, promoted China's important task of resisting the war, fighting for world peace, and fighting for international justice, which won the sympathy of the people there. They actively assisted China with manpower and material resources. Due to the Pacific War affecting the overall situation in the world, he felt the need to go to Europe to promote it. He did not hesitate to travel from New York to London, England, to promote and launch the滇缅 (Yunnan-Burma) joint offensive.</p>
<p>Visiting Paris Again</p>
<p>Since the United Nations opened the second front and landed in Normandy, France, the Hitler regime has been severely hit, and the European situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse. General de Gaulle, who had been fighting hard on the battlefield for a long time and worked hard to rebuild the country, finally triumphantly returned to the capital of France - Paris. At this time, Mr. Li was flying from London to France, which was recovering after the war, to visit. This was the old man's old place of travel, and old friends and new acquaintances gathered happily, which was of course unspeakably pleasant. It is said that since Pétain was exiled and Laval was executed, the country has unanimously launched a movement to eliminate traitors. However, France's finances are difficult after the war and it needs a lot of US assistance. The French people have a very good impression of de Gaulle and consider him a meritorious hero.</p>
<p>Publishing the Great Work "World Dictionary of Learning"</p>
<p>Now that the world's two major stubborn enemies have been wiped out and the anti-aggression work has come to an end, Mr. Li has also returned to China from his tired travels in Europe and the United States. He arrived in Shanghai last week and continues to work hard on the construction of cultural undertakings. The first and most important task is to publish a masterpiece, the "World Dictionary of Learning". The project is quite large and cannot be completed overnight. The old man has strong perseverance and has planned and prepared everything.</p>
<p>The Immortal Undertaking of Zhihui University</p>
<p>The second task is to promote the immortal undertaking of Zhihui University. Respecting the old (Cai Yuanpei) is eighty years old this year.

<h3>US Surplus Materials Should Be Sold to China - US Senator Donnell Advocates</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Members of the US Senate Committee on Military Affairs, Republican Nolan and Democrat Donnell, were sent to fly around the world to inspect US surplus materials and the repatriation of US troops. They arrived in Shanghai on the other day. At 8:30 AM yesterday, the two had a hearing at the former American Club to hear the appeals of more than 700 US troops in this city regarding their early repatriation.</p>
<p>Sino-US Trade Linked by This</p>
<p>In order to understand their views on the disposal of US surplus materials, the reporter paid a special visit to the two at their residence at the Cathay Hotel yesterday. According to Mr. Donnell, his personal opinion is that the surplus materials of the US military in the Philippines should be sold to China so that various materials and equipment can serve the welfare of mankind in a short period of time. Mr. Donnell believes that the sale of these surplus materials is actually the prelude to restoring the close ties of Sino-US trade, and looking forward to the future, our country will be the best customer of the United States. He also said that our country will have a "peculiar future".</p>
<p>Inspecting the Treatment of US Troops</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the repatriation of US troops, it is said to be a matter for the US Army and Navy Departments and Congress. His task is to inspect whether US troops in various places are receiving appropriate treatment, listen to the appeals of US troops, and convey recommendations to Congress. The reporter then visited Nolan. Mr. Nolan said that this trip was his first time, and before returning to the country to make a complete inspection report, it was not convenient to express sporadic opinions. However, he said that China's east coast is far away from his hometown of California across the Pacific Ocean. Based on the past friendship between China and the United States, the future friendship and connection between the two countries will continue to increase.</p>
<p>Leaving Shanghai for Singapore This Morning</p>
<p>The two, after a hurried journey, flew away from this city again at one o'clock this morning to Manila. It is said that they still have to travel to Singapore, Bangkok, Yangon, Calcutta, New Delhi, Bahrain, Cairo, Athens, Rome, Frankfurt, Paris, London and other places. If there are no climate changes along the way, they can be expected to return to Washington, DC in early February.</p>

<h3>Unlawful Police Extort Old Goods Stalls</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] There are many old goods stalls in the Jinjiafang area of Minguo Road in the south of the city, about 400 stalls.

<h3>Public Utility Workers in This City Are Rising Up to Demand Improved Treatment - Labor and Management Are Waiting for Mediation from All Parties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The six major public utilities in this city, after the government sent personnel to take over, were handed over to the original foreign merchants to operate. Because the treatment of Chinese and foreign employees is not the same, and the management cannot agree to the workers' proposed adjustments to wages and year-end bonuses, or they allow but cannot announce them, labor disputes have arisen one after another. The recent developments are as follows:</p>
<p>Electricity</p>
<p>The American-owned Power Company had a dispute because the workers demanded that the company fulfill the ten conditions agreed upon in September last year. Representatives from various party, government, and military agencies in the city convened four consultations between labor and management. Although some minor aspects such as improving welfare have been resolved satisfactorily, the most important aspects such as equal pay for equal work are not close to being resolved. Therefore, it was decided to submit the difficult-to-resolve issues to the Arbitration Committee for arbitration. Labor, management, and mediators will provide opinions separately. It is said that the three parties are actively collecting materials and evidence, and arbitration can begin in the short term.</p>
<p>Gas</p>
<p>More than 900 employees at the Yangshupu New Factory and the Xizang Road Old Factory of the British-owned Gas Company submitted a written request to the company on the 8th of this month, including a 19-point proposal including an eight-hour working day, annual bonuses, and retirement pay, limiting the reply to tomorrow [the 14th].</p>
<p>Telephone</p>
<p>Employees of the American-owned Telephone Company submitted a written request to the company authorities on October 30 last year, requesting multiple items such as salary adjustments. At that time, the company did not give a satisfactory answer. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, the employees requested the company to resolve the year-end bonus first on the 9th of this month and issue salaries in advance, limiting the company's reply to the 15th. It is said that the monthly salary of low-level employees of the company is about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. As for improving the treatment of Chinese workers and equal pay for equal work, etc., we should wait for the mediation of the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Tram</p>
<p>The British-owned Tram Company once had a strike. After the Social Affairs Bureau intervened, the workers' requests for increased wages and equal treatment with foreign employees were submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau and the company authorities in writing on the 7th of this month. Now more than 3,000 employees are waiting for mediation.</p>
<p>Seizing Guns While Attending a Wedding Feast</p>
<p>Director He of the Longhua Police Branch received a secret report yesterday that a large group of bandits were attending a wedding feast at Qian Meijia's house in Qianjiawan, Qibao Town, western Shanghai. He immediately sent Gao Rujun, the head of the judicial section, to lead the patrol police and the 88th Division soldiers. At about 6:00 PM yesterday, they arrived at Qianjiawan, first surrounding Qian's house and prohibiting entry and exit. Then they went inside to search. Except for those with gun licenses and supporting documents, they confiscated two pistols, three shotguns, and five suspects, including Xu Heshang, on the spot, and took them to the branch for interrogation along with Qian Mei.</p>
<h3>People's Livelihood Coal Management Office to Be Established Soon; Coal Briquette Factory Expected to Start Operations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee, in order to stabilize the city's fuel supply, has initiated the establishment of a "People's Livelihood Coal Management Office." This office will be jointly organized by the Coal Industry and Coal Briquette Industry Associations to take charge of coal matters. Concrete agreements have been made, and it is expected to be formally established in the near future. At that time, all coal chunks, coal dust, and coal briquettes will be sold at the lowest prices in various districts to ordinary citizens whose monthly electricity consumption is below 30 degrees.</p>
<p>Various mechanized coal briquette factories have now gradually completed the repair of their machinery. However, they are hampered by an insufficient stockpile of white coal dust. Furthermore, due to electricity restrictions, some speculative coal merchants are collecting large amounts of coal slag and using hand-cranked machines to manufacture and sell low-quality coal briquettes to seek extra profits. Once the allocation of people's livelihood coal begins, all coal briquette factories will be able to start operations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai French Concession Arrest Case: We Raise Three Demands</h3>

The French envoy in Chongqing believes that the conditions are favorable and verbally stated that there is no problem. However, there has been no formal response, and it is feared that a decision will have to wait for the outcome of negotiations in Paris.</p>

<h3>Check the Roots First</h3>
<p>— Shi Dongshan</p>
<p>I often see some old friends in the drama circle publishing articles in the newspapers, saying how bad the atmosphere among drama workers is now and that it should be improved. The articles do not cite specific events, and at first glance, they seem reasonable. Once, I happened to meet a few heads of theater troupes at a friend's house, and they were also talking about this so-called "atmosphere" problem. Everyone listed many events, complaining to each other, all with frustrated expressions or making regretful sighs. For a time, they found common ground in their conversation and felt very harmonious, as if they had found an opportunity to vent, and they suddenly felt a sense of mutual sympathy and pity. However, when someone calmly analyzed the events they mentioned from the side, it was felt that although there were indeed some issues related to the morality of individual comrades, most of them were due to the morality and leadership methods of the leaders—themselves—or the social environment.</p>
<p>If you want to improve anything, it is incorrect, unfair, and useless to focus on the branches instead of starting from the root. If the roots are bad, it will definitely affect the branches and leaves of the whole body. Therefore, if you find that most of the branches and leaves are diseased, it is best to check the roots first. The masses are the easiest to manage and the most difficult to manage. How do you say that? If the leaders can be strict with their own morality and leadership methods—sincere and honest, selfless, thinking of everyone, honestly serving everyone, doing what they say, honestly explaining the difficulties when they can't do it, not making promises lightly, being tolerant of others' criticism, humbly considering others' opinions, not acting unilaterally, not showing off, trying to persuade people as much as possible, not issuing orders forcibly, asking more about people's pain and difficulties, and trying to solve them for them... Just with these simple points that everyone can say, as long as you can do it, you can already make everyone服 you. In this way, the masses can become the easiest to manage; otherwise, the masses can become the most difficult to manage. At the same time, you must have a reasonable system to match your good morality, that is to say, you must not only have good "people" but also have good "laws" and "systems." The so-called good laws and systems must be able to communicate vertically and horizontally, not isolate superiors and subordinates, not allow each to act on their own, but be able to care for each other, encourage each other, and supervise each other to achieve the effect of collective wisdom and effort. (It's not that I'm being trendy, but it must be democratic.) Such a group cannot be run poorly. According to our experience and knowledge, there are only two reasons why a group is run poorly. First, is the so-called "if the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam will be crooked." The masses see that the matter is fundamental, but they can't help and are embarrassed or lack the courage to stage a "down with" or "overthrow," so at first they just complain verbally, and finally, they become depressed, passively resist work, and the rude ones inevitably act impulsively, so that everyone "橫竪橫, 拆牛棚". Second, is due to lack of vertical and horizontal communication (undemocratic practices), which leads to many misunderstandings, many disputes, and eventually chaos and collapse.</p>
<p>I always feel that there are relatively few bad elements, so in a group, as long as the leaders lead effectively, and the system is reasonably set, the law is established practically and precisely, and it can be used fairly and reasonably, such a group cannot be run poorly. If it is said that bad elements are most likely to affect the group, 出寧 say that good systems and good laws will definitely make the masses tend to be good, as long as the leaders have this vision and attitude and dare to open up democracy.</p>
<h3>Return of Spring to the Isolated Island</h3>
<p>— Xu Xinqin</p>
<p>——A Dedication to Artists in Front and Rear Lines Suffering Eight Years; Proud Backbone Supported the Isolated Island Without Running Out of Road; Today the Country's Doors are Like a Sea of Spring; How Many Artists are Entering the Final Act.</p>
<p>When I was in the rear, I appreciated the drama and film work of the artists during the Anti-Japanese War, and although I only remembered some discontinuous play and film titles in my mind, I felt that their meaning was very profound. For example, the first time I saw "Children of China," then "Metamorphosis," then I visited the filming of "Ten Thousand Miles of the Long Sky," and I saw on stage "The Wind on the Border," the satirical play "Demons Dancing Wildly," the filmed "Phoenix City," "Long Live the Nation," "Nation Above All Else," "Magnificent Mountains and Rivers," until "Blood Splattered on Cherry Blossoms" and then "Return My Homeland." And I especially remember "Paradise of the Isolated Island," "Boundless Future," "Hometown of White Clouds," "Punishment," "Fog Chongqing," and "Miaofeng Mountain." As for "Night Journey," "Lili Grass," "One Year," and "The Return of the Wanderer in the Snowy Night," all the way to the recent "Around the Qingming Festival" and "Fragrant Grass End of the World." Because of these works, I feel exceptionally close to the artists. At that time, the drama and film works that were transmitted from Shanghai to the rear, in addition to appreciating them, I also pasted the instructions and drama reviews that I could get on a large "Drama Movement Collection" booklet, in order to show them to these friends when I meet them in the future, as an aid to conversation. I remember that I seemed to have seen all the artists in Kunming when victory was about to come.</p>
<p>I was in for years, and today I have returned to Shanghai. Most of the old and new friends in the drama and film industry have gradually encountered each other within a month, but unfortunately, due to work and personal matters, I have not yet been able to chat about my accumulated feelings. But at this time of the return of spring to the earth, I have gained the two armies of heaven and human warming!</p>
<p>Whether the artists are in the rear or on the isolated island, people seem to be not犬得意吧? Everyone likes to say: "The drama and film industry does not seem to have 　暖?"　則 I think that the workers always give 　暖 to the audience. Just as engineers and civil construction workers do not all build houses for themselves. So "Who is working hard for whom?" All the admiring audience will know! And the most direct comfort to the workers is probably the enthusiastic and eternally remembering　們群衆吧!</p>
<p>Workers do not have to be sad, at this time they should cheer up and "lead the way" for the spring of national victory. Because drama and film work is the vanguard of culture, especially please face the admiring masses! The masses are cheering for you! I hope you will give them a lot of　暖!</p>
<h3>US State Department Hires Cao Yu and Lao She to Lecture</h3>
<p>According to a report from Si Kao, the US State Department recently decided to hire two giants of the Chinese drama circle, Cao Yu (Wan Jiabao) and Lao She (Shu Sheyu), to lecture in the United States. It is reported that the two have accepted the appointment and will prepare to go abroad in the near future. (Drama and Film Society)</p>
<h3>"Eagle-Lion" Comes to Shanghai to Compete for the British Film Market</h3>
<p>Since Germany's defeat and surrender and the end of the European War, the British side, like Hollywood, has been actively engaged in film production. It is expected that a large number of new films will soon be shipped overseas for public screening to compete with American films. They also attach great importance to the Western film market in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Eagle-Lion Film Company, which came to Shanghai from Chongqing, is a joint organization of major British film studios, specializing in the distribution and screening of films. Recently, the company's representative in China, Tom Baker, led several staff members from Chongqing to Shanghai. They have rented a large building on the Bund to formally conduct business and begin negotiating the screening of British films with various cinemas at sea.</p>
<p>Cooperation with the United States Some of the new films produced by British factories in 1946 have already been shipped to China, and others are on their way. The Eagle-Lion Company is a large-scale organization that not only distributes productions but also represents British film studios in negotiating everything externally. It is said that the company's affiliated factories have established friendly terms with MGM, Paramount, and other major American film studios for the exchange of actors and directors. In the later stages of the Anti-Japanese War, the Eagle-Lion Company introduced several British films to Chongqing audiences, which received much praise, and now their sights are on Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shaw's Masterpiece Tom Baker told the press that he believes that British films will definitely gain a considerable position in Shanghai in the future. Because after the war, the new films produced by British factories are mostly masterpieces. For example, Shaw's famous "Caesar and Cleopatra" (Cesar and Cleopatra), starring Claudette Colbert and Vivien Leigh, is having its world premiere in the United Kingdom. Londoners have praised it as a masterpiece. In fact, it is indeed the greatest British film of 1945. It will soon be shipped to all parts of the world for public screening.</p>
<p>Producing a Masterpiece At the same time, Ingrid Bergman, who was recently selected as the best actress of 1945 in Hollywood, has been scheduled to star in the historical masterpiece "Mary Magdalene" (Mary Magdalene), produced by Chadwick and distributed by Eagle-Lion Company. All work is in active progress. The production cost of this film is estimated to be US$4 million. American newspapers have already introduced it in advance. It will be an extraordinary production in British films.</p>
<p>Film Screening Plan Baker further stated that in the coming year—1946—he plans to publicly screen at least 24 new films produced by British factories in Shanghai, an average of two films per month. All the films screened, regardless of their nature, content, subject matter, cast, and directors, will be selected as the best. In this way, the future British film market in Shanghai can be effectively laid a foundation.</p>
<h3>British Film Industry Tycoons Go to Film City to Select Beauties</h3>
<p>British film industry tycoon Arren felt that it was not easy to find British beauties, so he had to visit Hollywood, which is world-renowned and has many beauties, at the beginning of this month to select real talents. Arren told a reporter from the Drama and Film Society: British film stars were not originally ugly, but their words and actions were too restrained, lacking the expression of sexual beauty, which is far inferior to the beauties of Hollywood. Arren's trip was very smooth, and he has obtained the consent of Ms. Ingrid, 十曼女士, and Ms. Zhong Fangting to play the leading roles in two films. At the same time, he agreed with American producers to exchange stars at any time. Arren also said: Britain not only lacks films that express sexual beauty, but also lacks such playwrights. Most of these playwrights live in the countryside and rarely interact with cities. They write in an ivory tower, and they are not as energetic as American playwrights. Therefore, works about love and sexual beauty will still have to be taken from American materials in the future, [American Correspondence from the Drama and Film Society]</p>
<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>"Dream Girl"</h3>
<p>— Wang Shen</p>
<p>"Dream Girl" is written and directed by 爱尔受·拉埃斯. In addition, he also赔出 的太太培丹·菲尔特 to play the leading role. As a result, a light-hearted and lively drama was made, and movie fans who paid to see the play would never complain冤枉.</p>
<p>When the curtain rises, Georgina Olerton, who is 23 years old, pretends to be an old maid. She thinks she is in love with her brother-in-law. Georgina runs a bookstore, and her brother is also in the printing industry. Later, she met a book and newspaper broker who was quite fond of her. This gentleman was very lively, but his thoughts were not very bright. Later, she met a literary critic who could write reviews without reading the original text.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned characters plus her parents are the most important roles around Georgina. Most of these people are dreamers in the air. This film is not only a comedy but simply a fantasy.</p>
<p>This Miss Georgina, who loves to fantasize, sometimes thinks of herself as Portia in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," singing of compassion and impartiality, and at another time, she is the mother of two 洋囡囡, suddenly she thinks of herself as the goddess who committed suicide by the roadside, and suddenly she fantasizes about messing around with a married man in Mexico. Finally, waking up from daydreaming, she only bought a toothbrush and a bag of snacks, and suddenly went to be a bride on her honeymoon. The double switch of the lens is very exciting, and it happens to keep up with Georgina's lively performance.</p>
<h3>Promote Children's Drama</h3>
<p>— Wang Huaide</p>
<p>Not long ago, the authorities issued an order prohibiting children under the age of nine from entering久 theaters or cinemas. So, in a daily newspaper, I saw an article saying that the authorities' measures were still open to discussion. My view on this matter is different from that of the author of that article. I think that the plays performed in Shanghai's current theaters are not suitable for children to watch. The authorities' method is because they are afraid that the young minds of children will be affected by those "adult plays" and create future bad consequences, which undoubtedly has great significance.</p>
<p>I think, instead of prohibiting children from watching "adult plays," why not promote plays specifically for children to watch? Needless to say, there are excellent examples of this in European and American countries. But things abroad are too far away, and I don't want to say them one by one. Just the performance of children's operas in the Russian Emigrant Association in Shanghai can indeed be followed by us.</p>
<p>The author was invited by a friend to visit a children's opera at the Russian Emigrant Association. The so-called opera is that the actors are all small children, and only a few adults appear in unimportant roles. As for the plot of the performance, because the author does not know Russian, I naturally don't know what it is talking about, and I don't understand it at all; but judging from the plot, it is probably nothing more than containing education. Many innocent Russian children sometimes dance, sometimes sing, sometimes have dialogues, and sometimes have expressions on the stage; although it is inevitable that they are childish, it is good that the targets are all children. If they accidentally make a joke, it does not matter. It attracts a lot of laughter in the hall, and the general audience of children finds it more interesting. They—the little audience—come with their parents, and they often ask their parents questions, and the parents explain them in detail: it is rare to find this situation among Chinese parents.</p>
<p>We hope that there will be theaters dedicated to children, and plays performed by children themselves will appear. So that children have their own theaters and watch their own plays.</p>
<p>Editor's note: During the Anti-Japanese War, the Political Department organized a children's theater troupe for children who were displaced and homeless. The playwright Ling He once served as the head of the troupe. A group of innocent children learned and performed plays at the same time, which was praised by the public. Now, most of the young members of the troupe are already young men and women. Some continue to study, and some have joined professional or amateur theater troupes.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Drama School Dissolves</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Drama School, which has been established for seven years, officially announced its dissolution a few days ago. Economic difficulties are the biggest reason. The drama school has cultivated many talents. In the future, they will meet the audience on the stage in an independent posture. There are still many students who have not graduated and have to drop out halfway and seek other achievements. This is very unfortunate news.</p>
<p>Weekly Film Review</p>
<h3>"Dragon Seed"</h3>
<p>— Lai Ming</p>
<p>This is another new masterpiece by the American Ms. Pearl S. Buck after "The Good Earth." When the book was published, MGM Film Company immediately selected the best director and actors with suitable acting skills to produce the film. In this film, it depicts the history of the resistance of the people in the occupied areas of China to Japanese imperialism during this war, and the customs, habits, and plot of the play are extremely tactful and moving and lamentable.</p>
<p>This film is directed by two major directors, Jacques Conway and 皮斯寇脱, and their techniques are ultimately extraordinary. As for the actors, of course, we should first recommend Katharine Hepburn. She is an actress who has made a comeback. In playing the role of Jade, she fully exerted her acting skills. In this film, she has a scene of singing Chinese ditties, which is very Chinese in flavor. There is also a moment when Jade is in the countryside, preparing to poison many Japanese thieves, which is very tense. Finally, she and her husband, Lao Er, lead a group of villagers to destroy the garden. The fiery scene of the burning yard is particularly thrilling and very great. In addition, the director used majestic songs as the musical background, coupled with all the Chinese dialogues, which made the audience of our country even more suitable for understanding. Therefore, this is really a genuine imported Chinese film!</p>
<p>The new star Du Yingbei (one of the protagonists of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves) plays Lao Er, the veteran film actor Walter Huston's Lin Dan, and Michael Murong's Lin's wife all perform with the beauty of珠聯璧合. The sensation of this film surpasses that of "The Good Earth" in the past, so it is a film that our people are值得 one to watch.</p>

<h3>New Widow Cries Injustice for Her Husband: Shot Dead by Police While Returning Home Late at Night</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: I am ashamed to live, unable to die. Now I have become the most unfortunate and pitiful new widow in the world. In my current living environment, I am indeed barely surviving, destined to become a starving corpse in the future. I believe that all compatriots with compassion will not remain indifferent. Therefore, I dare to appeal to all citizens here. The truth is this: How did I become a new widow? Alas! It is painful to say. On the evening of the 25th of last month, at about 10:00 PM, my son Gongxia (6 years old) woke up and cried incessantly, demanding snacks. My husband, Qian Chu, went out to buy something. When he returned to the alley entrance, two armed policemen were waiting there. Seeing my husband, they ordered him to stop. It was raining and dark, making it difficult to distinguish. This caused my husband to misunderstand. He panicked and fled towards Yuanfang Lane. Unfortunately, he was shot dead by Xu Xianzong, a member of the judicial section of the Changning District Police Bureau, without asking any questions. Not only did the section member not show remorse, but he also falsely accused my husband of being a gambler, attempting to evade his own legal sanctions. Heavens! My husband was not a notorious bandit. In fact, he had no weapons and could have been pursued. Instead, they could have fired a warning shot into the air. Now, after victory, is this how our people's safety is guaranteed?</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: Think about it for me. There is a 71-year-old mother-in-law at home, and five children, the oldest daughter being 21 years old, and the youngest only 2 years old. With my intelligence and ability, how can I maintain our daily food? On the other hand, I cannot seek justice for my husband. Ashamed to be Qian's wife, the bitterness in my heart is difficult to express. In a situation where "there is no door to heaven, no way to earth," the only thing I can do is appeal to society, asking all citizens to judge fairly with a spirit of justice. I believe that "people are not made of wood or stone, how can they bear to sit idly by." Therefore, I shout out as my last appeal, fathers and elders of the city, quickly come and rescue this most unfortunate and pitiful new widow in the world! This is my sincere hope. Qian Lumeiling, anxiously awaiting assistance in seeking justice for her husband.</p>
