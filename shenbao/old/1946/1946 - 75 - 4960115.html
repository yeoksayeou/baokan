<p>〔中央社重慶十五日電〕二中全會十五日上午第十七次大會中，通過軍事復員工作決議案如下軍事復員工作決議案</p>
<p>本會議聆取軍事復員工作報告及各委員提議，詳加審議，認爲軍政當局對於軍事復員之各項措施，均能本最高統帥之指示，確定計劃，認眞執行。而整軍一項，辦理尤著成效，吾全體將士亦能深明大義，服從命令，遵照實施。各委員提議多能切中肯綮，適合需要，足資採取，嘉慰良深。此次八年抗戰，使敵人無條件投降，而獲致最後勝利，實由我全體官兵之忠勇奮鬥，克盡天職，但値此世界永久和平，尚未確切建立之際，我民族生存，國家獨立之保障，尚有賴於充實之國防力量，而國際和平之保障，亦有賴於愛好和平國家之具有足以衛護和平之實力，故今後應特爲注意國防建設及優遇國家軍人。茲就現況，瞻望前途，提示應行注意之點如下：</p>
<p>（一）現代化國防之積極建設現代化國防，必須陸海空軍形成一體，統一其建設及指揮，乃能步驟一致，發揮整體之效能，且軍事基礎應建立於工業科學之上，尤宜着眼於空軍建設。至於徵兵制度與其組織，必須力求改進，臻於健全，俾在平時保留最小額常備軍，而於必要時得以迅速動員足够之兵員，以適應實際之需要。關於預備軍官之養成與儲備，亦須確立制度，妥為實施。</p>
<p>（二）官兵待遇之切實改善　官兵生活之困苦，達於極點，若不切實改善，不特降低士氣，影響紀律，抑且無法提高軍隊紫質，有礙建軍前途，政府有關各部，應本左列原則，於最短期內速求改善：（甲）官兵待遇，應比照文職，以求平允。（乙）主副食品及馬乾，應由公給，並貫澈實物補給之旣定計劃，如必須一部發給代金時，亦應比照市價發足。（丙）軍人服裝，官佐由公製，酌定價格分發，士兵全由公給。（丁）非正規軍（游擊隊挺進軍等），應速編遣，如因情形特殊，不能即行編遣者，應暫發維持費，使足維持生活。（戊）陸軍應逐漸設備固定營房，講求保育，藉與住民隔離，以便管敎。</p>
<p>（三）復員官兵之妥善安置對復員官兵，宜優予待遇，妥爲安置，政府應遵照總理兵工政策及屯墾授田轉業等辦法妥定（收敎養用）之計劃，使平時爲國家生產建設，各得其所，各安其生，而戰時則動員召集，仍爲捍衛疆土之忠勇戰士，使復員工作得以順利進行，地方秩序亦可藉以安定。</p>
<p>（四）切實辦理勛獎撫卹旌表與救濟事宜　抗期中作戰忠勇立有功勛之官兵，應予以勛獎，傷殘士兵應妥爲安置，對其家屬，應予救濟，至陣亡官兵及其遺孤，更應詳爲查明，分別旌表與撫卹，務使有功必獎，獎必有功，死者得安，生者得養，以符國家獎功勸忠之旨，在手續上並應力求簡化，俾得實惠。</p>

<h3>二中全會　人物素描</h3>
<p>— 本報重慶特約記者　趙浩生</p>
<p>蔣總裁在開幕禮及兩次紀念週均到會，着戎裝，每次均由會塲右側門步入，站立於主席台上，在水銀燈的照耀下，神釆益顯煥發，滿面慈悅，如在家人團坐中，致詞時，音調鏗鏘，字字如斬釘截鐵，抑揚頓挫，充滿無限力量和動人感情，在宣讀國父遺囑和黨員守則時，緩慢，淸晰，發人深省感情，充滿於語句中，每次禮成奏樂時，總裁咸肅立座前，最後向全體還禮，由台上右側門走出。</p>
<p>大會主席團的十一位中委，各有不同的風格，于院畏體格魁梧，精神健旺，銀髯飄飄，端坐在主席台正中的皮靠背椅上，被周圍五光十色的布置烘托着，成爲一輻瑰麗無比的畫面，于氏以低沉的陝西口音發言，通過擴音機傳出，特別顯得莊嚴。七日下午，于氏主持最熱烈的一次「政治協商會議檢討會」，指揮若定，始終一絲不亂。</p>
<p>居院長常着淺藍布長衫，久經水洗，似乎有點發白了，間或再加上一件黑坎肩或馬掛，一雙粉底圓口布鞋，一塵不染，滿身輕快，表現着無限飄逸瀟洒的風度，主持大會，緩慢，沉着，發音朗健。</p>
<p>戴院長的衣着，較居院長是雍容華貴，他經常是穿着寳藍色大團花的灰鼠皮袍，罩緞馬掛，中央委員的徽章，佩在右襟上，斑百的短髭，表現着蘊藏的決斷和力量。發言時，層次分明，以純粹緩慢的四川口音說出，字字淸晰，他常常自己走到主席台前遞送要求發言的條子，十一日上午，邊疆問題報告時，他和坐在後排的馮玉祥低聲交談甚久。</p>
<p>陳果夫先生是黨的老戰士，也是能以超人的生命力克服病魔的人，開會期間，他很少缺席或連到，他穿着長袍馬掛，不同的，是加了一個黑毛線的領圈，主席台上的擴音機很響，但整整三個鐘頭的開會，下面却從未聽見果老一聲咳嗽。</p>
<p>旁聽過政洽協商會議的人，都會知道孫院長主持會議的才能，他從來是平心靜氣，不慌不忙，他有一個習慣，就是在看文件的時候，總是把那架在鼻樑上的近視鏡，推到額頭上去</p>
<p>陳誠部長精幹有力的精神，可以在他那炯炯的目光中看出，他坐在主席座位上，主持大會，始終面露微笑，但陳部長碰的不巧，他所主持的第七次會，是善後救濟報告及檢討，正在外交檢討之後，暴風雨剛過，會塲空氣輕鬆中有點疲勞，檢討善後救濟，內容如談家常，又遇着一位談話常使人發笑的劉成燦委員冗長的發言，以致使他不能不一再催促：「簡短點」</p>
<p>何總長的威儀，在主席台上也購成了一幅光彩無比的畫面，紅潤飽滿的面孔，左胸前一排各種彩色的勳章，與上將金領章交相輝映，光華閃閃，一口純粹的貴州話，與四川話同樣的緩慢淸整。</p>
<p>鄒魯先生的衣着·舉動，都非常家常，說話聲音比較尖，比較快，他的：「第ＸＸ號ＸＸＸ同志發言」報告，常常敎人聽不淸楚，以致無法按圖索引，但發言人向他請求：「再延長一分鐘」時，他總是常常寬予允諾的。</p>
<p>陳立夫先生尚未主持大會，但他常是主席團的會外代表人，華北各省請願代表，是他與白副總長代表接見，旅渝安徽學生請願團，也是他與張道藩先生代表接見，在大會上，他尚未發言。</p>
<p>白崇禧將軍，是主席團中在大會上發言較多的一位，他的談話，有力量，有定見，常常贏得大鼓掌。</p>
<p>張道藩先生，是主席團中最辛苦的一位，他已經成爲主席團的發言人，許多文件，都由他向大會報告，他以一口純粹的國語，每段之前，常加上：「下面，請大家特別注意」！「這裏還有一個更重要的臨時動議」！休息的時候，常見他啣着一只燃着香烟的長烟嘴，與左右閒話，話語輕鬆，笑聲朗朗，開會時，則常見他戴起黃色化學鏡架的眼鏡，靜靜的在閱讀報告。</p>
<h3>發展西北交通　扶植民營航業</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十五日電〕二中全會十七次大會，通過交通問題決議案，大要如次：查交通問題包括運轍通訊，在抗戰期中，每爲軍事得失利鈍之所關，原極重要，今敵寇投降，則復員工作之完成，亦賴交通爲主要事項，如何奠定建國基礎，增强國防，亦莫不以交通爲首要之圖，今後允宜照旣定陝策，加强力量，努力以赴，茲綜合檢討諸端，臚陳左列各點：（一）交通員工，努力工作，殊堪嘉慰（二）交通部對人力，物力，財力之調配，爲事實所限，自難達到適合進度，更有中共部隊隨處阻撓破壞，而交通員工仍能堅毅進行，甚望於形勢可能時，迅速工作，以期配合需求。（三）戰時趕修與戰後修復鐵路，公路工程等，對於復員運輸，均有裨益，惟於實際需要，仍嫌不足。（四）關於交通制度之改革，仍望繼續硏討。（五）水陸空復員運輸計劃，以限於工具，未能達到需要，政府應將已接收之各種交通工具，儘量交由交通部管理利用，責成其統籌支配，管理機構，須力求集中簡化，同時注意掃除一切弊端，嚴厲取締黑票，至運送義民，難民還鄉，更不容緩。（六）西北交通有關國家大計，無論鐵路·公路·航空·郵電，均應積極開發，列爲最重要工作，計劃舉辦。現值整軍之際，編餘官兵當不在少，自應妥予安置。關於兵工築路辦法，極爲適宜，可即會同有關機關，切實商討，先就西北方面積極推行。（七）民營航業，有助于復員運輸，應速加扶植，促其積極發展。（八）鐵路材料應利用自製路軌配件。公路汽車亦應自行設廠製造。交通技術員工，務須積極訓練，大量培植，其薪給待遇，尤須予以合理調整，（九）電但事業，慶力謀改善，以達迅速確實。至中央與地方以及其他機構辦理通訊業務，應再明確規定範圍與限度，期能切合實際，各地臨時設置之軍用報話綫，並應切實調整。</p>

<h3>由南北開蘇軍列車　駛過哈爾濱東去　哈市附近蘇軍有蝋斷開模樣</h3>
<p>〔本報哈爾濱十四日電〕藩陽蘇軍撤退消息傳至此處後，人心振奮，極盼國軍能早日推進，軍事代表團團員楊作人今日到哈，或與蘇軍有所洽商。黑龍江，合江兩省府人員，定十九日離哈返長，對於東北整個接收問題，並無影響。哈市府經費萬分困難，但各項工作仍積極推行。</p>
<p>〔中央社哈爾濱十四日電〕十四日午曾有由南北來之蘇軍車十三列運哈，除一小部份在哈站下車外，餘均東去。哈市附近各地蘇軍，亦有向哈市集中，準備移動模樣。現每日均有滿載物品之長蛇列車，分向綏芬河及扎蘭屯方而開去。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十四日電〕據政府方面今日接得電訊，火車七列載瀋陽撤退蘇軍已駛過長春，當係開赴西伯利亞，其餘尚滯留長春之藩陽駐軍，亦即將隨後開拔。在瀋陽四郊活動之地下分子，前曾疑其將與中共合作，今則已投效國軍，同時據傳，共軍數萬人正自瀋陽北方一百三十餘里之法庫向撫順方面移動，另有共軍四萬人正向平泉進發，平泉在錦州西四百餘里。又據觀則想係中蘇友好協會會長李兆麟被暗殺之後果。</p>
<h3>瀋陽秩序甚佳　警備部今成立</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十五日電〕記者今日上午十時五十分以長途電話向瀋陽彭璧生主任，詢問瀋陽近況，據稱：市內秩序甚佳，惟自昨晚起全市水電皆停滯，當為東大營房嘴子發電所遭受破壞所致，該發電所係被共軍佔據者。目前渾河南岸之渾河堡，尚有一大規模發電所，亦於最近被共軍佔據，國軍今晨已派隊前往接收，不知是否將發生衝突。瀋陽警備司令部定十六日上午成立，由趙公武任司令彭璧生任副司令，俟該部成立後，前進指揮所即行結束。彭氏又稱，瀋陽飛機塲現在國軍防守中，本日可能有飛機首次降落該機塲。按自十三日晚九時以來，此爲記者首次與瀋陽通電話，長瀋間電話似不通暢，鐵嶺電話局，仍未恢復工作。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十五日電〕軍事代表團長董彥平，今午十二時自錦州飛返此問。又該團團員楊作仁，昨乘車赴哈，或將於日內偕滯留哈市之合江黑龍江兩省主席及接收人員返回長春。</p>

<h3>津浦路北段　修通至韓莊</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州十四日電〕津浦北段修復工作，進行順利，現已修通至韓莊。隴海東段大廟以東，開工情形亦尚良好，日昨交部凌次長鴻勛墍交通小組人員，前往兩路搶修地帶實地視察歸來，表示相當滿意。凌次長在徐公畢，已於今晨赴開封轉鄭州等地視察</p>
<h3>日關東軍殘部　潛伏東北各地</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕東北光復初期曾在哈爾濱參加中蘇文化協會工作之某君據談：哈市中蘇文協力會長李兆麟，四平街中蘇文協會長于樹中，先後被刺殞命，此兩大驚人血案，似與上週在東北蘇軍控制下破獲之日軍恐怖團體所謂「暴殺團」有微妙之關運。潛伏東北各地之日關東軍中陰險份子，過去曾於東北問題造成之多種錯綜複雜局勢下，遂行其親蘇諜華，揚共抑國之種種無定性陰謀。所謂「無定」者，即凡事只求於日本復興有利，不妨今日親之，明白殺之，藉以困惑東北土地上任何有力份子。聞曾予若輩生存便利，如蘇軍，如中共，亦不例外。渠深信若輩之勢力，且已隨數十萬日俘而共同工作於西伯利亞。敏感有爲之蘇聯特務，亦無如之何，非不知也，乃由估計太輕，利用心切，有以使之耳。現此類暴殺團已捕獲正兇九人，嫌疑犯十五名，然欲望一網打盡，亦非難事，祇須中蘇互信，蘇聯實踐諾言，從東北撤退，疑雲盡去，若輩即難在光天化日之下施其鬼蜮伎倆矣。</p>
<p>〔本報哈爾濱十四日電〕李兆麟案已有綫索，日內可破獲。</p>
<h3>增裕縣市收入　賦稅撥成增加</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶十五日專電〕中央以各縣市地方財源有限，支出浩繁，致有地方攤派之情形，有關當局為增裕各縣市行政經濟起見，聞自本年度起，將分配各縣市之田賦收入撥成數提高至百分之二十五歸地方收入，營業稅之撥成數提高至百分之五十。</p>

<h3>伊土明白表示　決心保衛國土　傳美已允助伊維護主權　蘇方否認在伊調動軍隊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十五日廣播：中東之火藥桶今日已更接近爆裂矣。伊朗陸長亞瑪第今告報界稱：蘇聯摩托化部隊，已自土耳其邊境向伊朗北部推進，但伊朗軍隊已準備抵抗至最後一人，保衛伊朗京城。</p>
<p>在過去數日中，蘇聯在伊朗各方面之軍隊，已增加三倍至四倍。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十五日廣播：據倫敦紀事報稱：美國已允援助伊朗政府，必要時，美國將助伊將蘇軍逐出境外。據謂：美駐伊大使莫里，曾訪伊朗實際統治者巴利維，保證美國決助伊維　其主權。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫效十五日廣播：伊朗駐美大使館今日證實：安全理事會二十五日開會時，伊朗將就應軍留駐伊朗問題，提出中訴。</p>
<p>又訊：距離伊朗京城西北二十三英里之卡拉基車站，每隔一夜，即有蘇軍車一列到達，內載坦克，大砲等。同時摩托卡車亦載有大批蘇步兵到達該處。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕據莫斯科電台今夜廣播塔斯社訊稱：「美國方面所傳蘇軍在伊朗調動之報告，並無事實根據。美國務院謂蘇軍經由大不列士南下開赴德黑蘭及伊朗西疆，本社茲受權發表聲明，絕對與事實不符」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社伊斯坦埠十四日電〕十耳其現仍全部動員，今日聞蘇聯戰鬥部隊在伊切向南移動，且沿土耳其伊拉克邊境直下，聞訊之餘，咸皆目瞪口呆，默不作聲。官塲方面並無直接反響，惟政府當局謂土耳其不容侵略，願出一戰。蘇軍移動目的所在，尚未能確定，但據外交界方面宣稱：此或爲對土施用壓力之一稱策略，意在取得蘇方於去年六月間所要求之卡爾斯及亞達亨兩省。土耳其軍隊現仍維持戰時兵力，約共一百萬人左右。據安加拉來電，該處聞蘇軍移動消息，較伊斯坦埠更形鎭靜，但與以深切注意。此次蘇聯陳兵土耳其柬南邊境，實際無異用兵包圍，蓋土耳其之東北境與喬其亞相對，東有亞眠尼亞與伊朗，北以黑海爲界，祗有南部伊拉克邊境並無蘇軍。</p>
<p>〔路通社德黑蘭十五日電〕倫敦官方所得蘇軍行動之消息，幷不詐盡，但有下述三點，當可加以證實：（一）自三月二日後蘇軍確向伊朗增兵，越境開入伊朗北部。（二）此項軍隊中有裝甲部隊在內。（三）伊朗沙姆那城，厦魯德城與梅希德城（皆在東北部），蘇聯駐軍則已撤退。</p>
<h3>杜魯們對記者談話　目前國際局勢　並不足以驚異　否認與國務卿發生異見　希望能參加安全理事會</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十五日電〕杜魯門總統昨於每週記者招待會上聲稱：目前之國際局勢，並未使其感覺驚異。渠對有關美蘇關係之問題避不作答，僅曰：「余不信局勢已如一般人所想像者之危險。」總統謂尚無舉行三巨頭會議之計劃，最近渠並未與史達林就國際問題有所接觸。總統聲明不能供給關於紅軍在伊朗移動事更多之消息，對於史達林之指責邱吉爾，亦拒不置評。記者又請總統對美國前任駐蘇大使哈立曼所稱之「蘇聯僅虛張聲勢耳」一語·發表意見，亦被拒絕，總統昨於召開記者招待會前曾召見哈立曼談約半小時。杜魯門總統謂聯合國安全理事會次如期於三月廿五日在紐約舉行，渠希望能參加首次會議，但最後決定，尚須視華盛頓之發展而定。總統重申渠信關於原子能之控制，應先徵求軍事領袖之意見，惟主要之控制權應賦予直接向總統負責之若干文官。</p>
<p>〔聯合社十四日華盛頓電〕杜書門總統在記者招待會稱：外傳渠與國務　貝爾納斯發生異見，　無根據。</p>

<h3>「安全」美名！</h3>
<p>蘇藉此所兼併之地　已達廿七萬餘方哩</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十五日專電〕紐約時報承認蘇聯有權要求安全，然同時指稱，蘇假安全之名，已在此次戰爭中併呑土地，廿七萬餘方英里，人口逾二千四百萬。吾人有理由詢問蘇聯謀求安全，將止於何處？其擴張又自何處開始？</p>
<h3>伊總理頒發　第一道命令</h3>
<p>〔聯合社德黑關十四日電〕伊朗總理沙丹納，今日頒發上月間就任後第一道命令，禁止公開政治性集會遊行。據稱：此舉動機係由於人民濫用政治自由之故。（按：據路透社倫敦電稱：伊總理已恢復人民之政治集會自由）</p>
<h3>邱吉爾　今日又要演說</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十四日電〕最近主張英美軍事同盟而引起莫斯科强烈反感之邱吉爾，將於星期五晚（上海時問星期六上午，十一時半）紐約歡迎實會中發表演說。</p>
<h3>蘇軍向土邊移動聲中　英美艦隊將訪土　主力艦及母艦均同行</h3>
<p>〔聯合社新澤西州大西洋城十五日電〕英國權威方面今日宣稱：英地中海艦隊之有力部隊，準備與美主力艦米蘇里號聯合訪問土耳其，送回土國駐美大使歐德根遺骸。歐氏係於一九四四年在華盛頓逝世。此項消息之來源方面不願宣布姓名，惟觀此足證英美兩國於保持對土友誼顯具決心。據國務院宣布：米蘇里號將僅率驅逐艦權威號一艘赴地中海，作爲護衛。英國方面則稱：英國地中海艦隊將有若干部隊與米蘇里號及權威號聯合，或並包含航空母艦數艘在內。英國最大主力艦一艘，或亦將加入同行。美國務院力言於此時派遣最大戰艦赴地中海，並無軍事關係。此次任務係有先例可援，惟觀於蘇軍在伊朗境內向土邊移動之報，此項消息，不免具有外交上之重要意義。</p>
<h3>羅斯福夫人語　一針見血</h3>
<p>若無非英語之人民　英語民族安能獨存</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十五日電〕參衆兩院女議員聯合委員會今日設宴招待故羅斯福總統之夫人，到千餘人。羅夫人即席致詞稱：邱吉爾領導英國作戰，功不可沒，惟「我人應當認淸，英語人民實力固然强盛，若無數目更應大之非英語人民，亦不能生存。」</p>
<h3>蘇土關係史的回溯</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕伊朗境內蘇軍調動頻繁，致蘇聯對土耳其之要求復引起世人密切注意。高加索邊境之卡爾斯及亞達亨兩省，係按照一九二一年條約讓與土耳其，蘇聯要求土耳其將兩省歸還，此外並要求在達達尼爾海峽獲得基地，惟據土耳其發言人稱，土國將拒絕此項要求，不惜一戰。蘇土兩國在歷史上夙不相睦，自前領土爭執不過其顯而易見者。蘇聯於去年三月間通告廢止一九二五年所訂蘇土友好條約，蘇聯報紙並指責土耳其與德國關係過於密切。自十八世紀開始以來，蘇土間從未保持長時間之眞正友好關係，兩國曾於一七三六，一七六八，一七九二，一八一二及一八五三年數次因領土問題而發生衝突。一八七七年蘇土又發生戰爭，結果將卡爾斯高原，劃為蘇聯所有。第九第十世紀時，阿門尼亞人曾在卡爾斯建立政府，此後即不斷發生爭執。第一次世界大戰時，土耳其雖爲戰敗國家，但於一九一二年卡爾斯及亞達亨兩省終以公民投票方式爲土耳其所有，土耳其亦因此面承認蘇聯政府。</p>
<h3>社論　邱吉爾的演說</h3>
<p>英國戰時政府首相邱吉爾最近在美國發表了兩篇演說，一篇是於三月五日在密蘇里州當爾頓地方的西寺學院講的，一篇則於三月八日發表於佛奇尼亞州議會。兩篇演說的辭句雖有不同，主旨却均在提高英美人士的警覺，主張英語民族須加緊國結，應付世變。在富爾頓西寺學院的那篇演說，邱氏曾率直地說：「英語民族倘不能如手足之情而聯絡一致，則仍難防止戰爭或促進世界機構之組織。英美兩國不但須以友好及互相諒解之精神，且需兩國軍事顧問保持密切關係。以硏究潛伏之危機</p>
<p>然後始可培植手足聯絡一致之情誼。更需聯合利用兩國在全世界各地所有之海空軍根據地，乃能互保安全。黑暗時代可以重臨，好景不常，盟國之勝利今已蒙受暗影，吾人應自警惕」、又謂：「余極景仰俄人及史太林同志之勇毅精神，英國今仍同情全俄羅斯民族而善意待之，並始終不變與之保持永久友誼。中歐與東歐古國今皆已在蘇聯勢力範圍之內。惟光榮之念典將在英美法視察之下作決定其將來之選舉：東歐各國之共產黨本屬少數，今之期露頭角，恐難勝任所負，竟欲爭取極權統治，現僅捷克斯洛伐克除外，餘皆無眞正之民主政治可言·蘇聯對土耳其所施之壓迫及德國境內俄人共產黨之情形，實皆非吾人於解放歐洲後進行建設所欲見者，亦非足以構成永久和平之要素」。</p>
<p>邱氏演說發表之後，本報始終不曾有所論列，這是因爲邱氏以下野之身，以一個平民的身份所發表的演說，本來不必重視；况邱氏演說的對象是美國的聽衆，所云英語民族需要加緊團結，應付世變等等，尤無席我們妄參末議。蘇聯對於邱氏的演說，本也保持緘　，到了十三日，莫斯科的「眞理報」，刋登了該報記者與史達林元帥的談話，史氏對邱氏所言，頗有抨擊。據聯合社倫敦十三日電：莫斯科電台廣播史達林元帥與眞理報記者談話，據史表示，邱氏之演說，其中涉及波蘭，南斯拉夫，羅馬尼亞及匃牙利之若干點，係屬撤謊。並稱：邱氏之演說甚爲危險。邱氏主張對蘇戰爭…彼不僅在英國有人與之聲應氣求，即在美國亦然。但有必須指出者，因邱氏及其友人。使人回想到希特勒及其友人。希特勒採用種族學說，以確立其戰爭主義，宣言祇有採日耳曼語者爲純粹之民族。邱吉爾亦以種族學說，鼓動戰爭；對於英語民族與以特權，並與以決定全世界命運之權利。…邱吉爾及其在英美兩國之友人，現正向非英語各國提出一種最後通牒曰：「你們若自動承認我們的優越權，則一切無事；否則不免戰爭。」</p>
<p>自史述林元帥發表此項談話後，邱氏本人，雖拒加評論，然英美輿論，却羣起抨擊，倫敦每日郵報謂：史達林元帥親自對邱吉爾濫施侮辱，實爲可鄙而遺憾之事，此非政治家應有之言。聞其言可以想見其爲人，渠之闡述目前之國際危機，僅能解釋世界之緊張局面，係因蘇聯之强權政治侵略隣邦而造成，但不能免除蘇聯之責任。紐約時報則謂：蘇聯如認美國國會對邱吉演說所表示之躊躇態度，乃分裂英美友好關係之機會，則屬錯誤。該報又謂，蘇聯如願予邱吉爾以有效之答復，莫斯科所需作者乃遵守其與其它國家所作之保說，協定及條約。</p>
<p>使我們感到驚異的是邱氏以平民身份所發表的演說，竟遭到蘇聯最高當局的抨擊。我們旣非所謂英語民族，而蘇聯又是我們偉大的盟邦，對於邱氏的演說及史達林的答辯，雅不欲有所論列。不過，正因爲我們不是所謂英語民族，如欲提出希特勒的種族學說用以還擊，則不難發見中國人民心理上同情的方向。希特勒及其朋友們是擊潰了，但希特勒主義的作風，如今究出現在世界的那一角落？</p>
<h3>英向蘇再提照會　質問在伊朗意嚮　貝文謂蘇現行政策無從索解</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十五日電〕英外交部發言人今日稱：英國已向蘇聯提出照會，質問在伊朗之意響如何，在未接覆文前，不能斷定蘇聯在中東政策，究屬侵略性質，抑係防衛性質。康培拉來訊，澳外長伊几特在澳國會所稱澳大利認爲蘇聯政策，旨在防衛一節，英國亦以爲然。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十四日電〕貝文外相今日在下院報告伊朗方面緊急局勢，謂蘇軍留駐伊朗期內，伊蘇兩國如有任何解決，顯係在威脅手段下强迫取得，英國對之勢將認爲憾事。蘇軍現仍留駐伊朗，惟英國是否將重派軍隊至伊朗紛擾區械，尚未決定，英政府亦未採取任何步驟，與伊政府談判英軍復回伊朗一事。蘇聯政府之現行政策殊使英政府無從索解，其所提供一切保證竟然並未履行，尤使人難以置信。</p>
<h3>上海飛紐約　廿八小時半可達</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社新　里十五日電〕據孟買消息，尼赫魯已擬就英印協定之大綱，其內容主張：（一）英國軍隊撤退，（二）印度獨立，（三）尊重各宗敎派別之權利，外國在印度之利益·以及各省實行自治之法理地位，英代表團定於本月廿四日抵此，此項草案當將交其研究，而成爲雙方進行之基礎。</p>
<p>〔路透社孟買十五日電〕甘地昨於民衆祈藉會中，囑印度人民保持忍耐，俾與英代表團以實現英政府諾言之機會。但甘地又日，如該一代表團又　來虛僞之諾言，則余當領導民衆，採取下一步應有之步驟。大會黨或將指定該黨主席阿柒特·甘地之左右手巴合爾·以及前主席尼赫魯等三人組織委員會，與英代表團談判，在談判期間，大會黨執委會當在德里繼續保持開會狀態，甘地亦當留守德里。</p>

<h3>中東各國軍力　以土耳其伊拉克素質最佳　英駐軍在五十萬員名以上</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕中東英軍實力，官方雖未完全宣布，但目前已不難予以估計。中東英軍之主要集中點，爲埃及·巴力斯坦與伊拉克三地。巴力斯坦爲中東英軍之吐納中心，該地除陸軍五師，計印度軍一師·步兵三師·傘兵一師外，尚有皇家空軍隊及工程隊共計約十萬人。此等雖爲摩托化之裝甲部隊，但並無一輛坦克車駐在巴力斯坦，該地營房早已住滿，故已無增兵之可能。伊拉克之英軍，以空軍爲主，輔以若干供應及警衛部隊，人數遠較在巴力斯坦者爲少。中東諸國之陸軍，以土耳其·伊拉克·外約但等軍素質最佳。土耳其陸軍共約五十萬名，伊拉克有受英國訓練英方發餉之機械化部隊約一萬六千名，此等軍隊係供自衛之用，亦從未參加近代化之戰爭。叙利亞陸軍約一萬名，黎巴嫩約五千名，亦均爲國內防軍性質。埃及陸軍人數，官方未有宣佈，估計約六萬名。艾德禮首相前宣布英國國內外武裝部隊共二百萬名，其中一百二十萬爲陸軍，海空軍各佔四十萬名，减去在德奧之英佔領軍數及遠東及印度之英軍數，則中東英軍總數，當較一般所估計之五十萬名至一百萬名間之數爲低。伊朗陸軍約九萬名，內已受訓者四萬五千名，餘均爲募兵，其配備陳舊不堪，官兵之間政治及社會成見殊深，僅事維持內部安全而已。</p>

<p>雲天福今年四十四歲，可是看去不過三十多歲，身材矮小，態度十分和善，說着一口流利的英語。他自一九三九年起即任暹羅政府國務卿。他的父親是中國人，可是他生長在曼谷，第一次來中國。談起暹羅華僑與暹羅人的衝突事件，雲氏說：「我可以保證，這事絕對沒有政治背景」也沒有反華德作用。中國和暹羅幾百年來　互相通婚中暹好像一家，暹羅人中許許多多是有中國血統的，我自己就是。幾百年來，中暹從未有不和睦的舉動發生，所以暹羅人絕對不會反華。這次事件發生於去年九月，原因都是爲了些極小的事情，如兩國風俗習慣上的小衝突等。一但最近此類衝突事件，已經平　，現　　共有中國僑民二百餘萬，曼谷則　千萬。屬於中暹通商問題，據雲氏稱，　　　運輸問題，暹羅無船隻運貨出口　如中國方面運輸便利，即可開始互相交易。目前暹羅方面最感缺乏的是紡織原料及房屋建築材料。現暹米出口，經英暹協定，槪由英國裝運，經華盛頓方面會商後，再行分配至其他各國。暹羅本國工商業並不發達，戰時進口貨物亦甚少。暹羅國內人民，敎育水準頗高，有半數以上人民均受過相當敎育。現曼谷有大學二所及其他專科學校及中學甚多，曼谷尙有一「婦女報」，內部除印刷工人外，一切職員均係女子。服裝方面，男女現大多採用歐洲式樣。暹王年僅二十，未婚，尙未加冕。前在瑞士大學攻讀政治。這次兩國，因為學未畢業，所以不久就要回到瑞士繼續求學。暹羅政體，大致按照英國，但國王必須是一個佛敎徒。暹羅執政的人多數是佛敎徒，雲氏和其他六團員也都是佛敎徒。曼谷在戰爭中損失也不補小，有房屋六千所被炸毀，所以極需建設起來。現有日軍約一萬三千人，日　二萬人，　英軍當局來協助。</p>
<p>遺送回國</p>
<p>訪華團自上月廿五日出發來華，到過重慶及北平。對於上海的印象很好，祗是覺得太冷，天天下雨，很不爽快。　平氣候更冷，難怪住慣熱帶的人受不了。雲氏等預備下星期三去南京佈置大使館，新任大使人選還未決定，可能由現任駐瑞士大使調任。到南京後再打算去重慶一行，勾留一星期左右南下經廣州後回國。</p>
<p>市商會茶會招待盼增進貿易關係</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會於昨日下午四時，在該會會議室舉行茶會，招待暹羅訪華代表團，到該團團長雲天福，團員拍披匿，拍那拉。市商會理事長王曉籟，秘書長嚴　聲，國民外交協會上海分會秘書長汪竹一，秘書廖烈進，外交部科長汪協熙，及工商各界領袖俞佐庭、胡西園、葛傑臣、王先青、陸英耕、金潤庠、葛凌白、張佩珍、邵啓羣等多人，首由王曉　致詞歡迎，由廖烈進譯成暹語。繼由雲團長用英語致答詞，略稱：對我國各界熱誠之歡迎，表示感謝，並稱在渝時據糧食部長徐堪氏告稱：已與英大使館洽妥，自递運米一萬五千噸來華。此次中國曾派訪問團至暹，故特組團來華答拜，深信兩國訂立中暹友好條約後，必能更增進友誼，加强合作。亟望兩國間之貿易，亦能日增月盛云。即席並出示暹羅商會理事長蘭森致本市市商會之函一通，大意謂希望兩國間之商會，能彼此合作，以促進中暹間之貿易關係，並望能予該團以研究我國貿易運輸金融商業等情況之便利，傳養疎通貿易路綫。又昨晚八時一刻由外交部邀請，在美琪大戲院觀電影，錢市長定今日中午，在私邸宴請各團員。</p>

<h3>德電台軍事評論員　彼得已遭逮捕　在寓內抄出重要文件　經偵訊後已解送法院</h3>
<p>納粹黨員，受德國第五縱隊直接指揮之德國電台軍事評論員彼得恩脫盤琪，頃已為我黨備總部稽查處捕獲。彼得俄人，生長於西伯利亞，在滬入德籍。原為建築工程師，俄國在遠東各地所建之要塞，渠知之頗詳，曾在滬發表城防要塞之論述頗多，故日方對其亦至重視。傳上海週圍之日方防禦工事，彼得亦有相當貢獻。滬德國電台成立，彼得即被聘為俄文軍事評論員，肆意攻擊盟國，其材料則由納粹及第五縱隊方面直接供給。迄至德國投降彼得發出「德國已投降，戰爭結束，此為普通的事而已。德國須鎮靜，並保持尊嚴」之最後廣播詞，乃始離開電台，匿居於靜安寺路西摩路口之寓所內。但與德國納粹人員，及日本海軍報導部，仍有密切往還。警備總部稽查處，經長時期之偵查，獲得彼得確實之戰爭罪證後，乃加以逮捕。聞並在渠寓所內，抄出高疊達一英尺半之重要文件，現正由當局加以整理調查中。至彼得經軍法處偵訊後，已解法院審訊矣。</p>

<h3>商會秘書長談　新公司法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者為外傳新公司法有於本年四月一日施行之說，特往訪市商會秘書長嚴　聲。據告：四月一日施行之說，係上海商社於上週舉行座談會時所傳，確否尙待證實。惟新公司法之修改與否，要須視中美商約如何訂定。現聞新公司法中，對外國公司在其本國應有「營業」二字之規定，國防最高委員會方面主張廢除，而立法院方面則主張保留。惟設以純粹學者與立法家之立場觀之，則似以保留為佳。將來如決定保留，則在華之許多外國公司，如本市之美商上海電力公司，英商上海自來水公司，上海煤氣公司等，將有所影響。</p>

<h3>工潮物價　互為因果　薪津調整未久　生活又成問題　社會局勞工處長發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局老概念股處李劍華處長，昨日對本報記者，發表關於工潮問題之談話稱：工潮之發生，乃由於物價之高漲，然物價之高漲，工潮亦為其原因之一。</p>
<p>蓋各業資方因職工薪津調整，開支增大，勢必將貨物售價提高，以資彌補。一業如此，各業皆然，於是職工調整後之薪津，勢又不夠維持生活，乃再度發生工潮。故工潮與物價已發生不可分離之關係，工潮周而復始。</p>
<p>循環不已</p>
<p>此種情形，最屬顯而易見，且十分嚴重，關於此點當局已密切注意，決將努力穩定金融，抑平物價，以求工潮之根本解決。惟戰時金融絮亂已極，欲恢復正常狀態，必須經過相當時期。在此苦難時期中，希望勞資雙方暫時忍耐，當不難渡過。現政府已作種種措施　如外匯之開放，俾海外物資源源流入；交通恢復，使運輸暢通；工廠復工，增加生產等，以期穩定金融。若物資一入常態，則工潮自可消弭。李處長之意料今年五月以後，本市工廠當可告平息，惟暫時或仍當綱續至若干時期也。</p>

<p>旅館工潮簽訂筆錄</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕旅館業工潮前日解決後，昨日下午在社　局簽訂和解筆錄，規定茶房工資照原薪加六成，資方房金照全市總數增加百分之六十。</p>
<p>太古碼頭工人罷工</p>
<p>太古碼頭工人千餘人，昨晨十時突全體罷工，致昨日到滬之太古船隻，均無法卸貨。其罷工原因，聞勞方以八九年來受生活壓迫，備極痛苦。三日前聞太古大班自英抵滬，乃聯合向大班請求對過去若干年來之損失，予以補助。公司當局未允所請，乃釀成罷工風潮。</p>
<p>影院司機</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各電影院司機，昨向資方提出加薪要求，頭輪三百三十元，二輪二百七十元，三輪二百四十元，四輪二百十元。以上底薪再乘以當月之生活指數。社會局已派朱圭林進行調解。</p>
<p>針織工人</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕天華、華勝、等十一家針織機器廠工友，要求日薪增加至每工三千至四千元，但資方僅允半數。勞資自行談判三次，不能解決，乃於前日晨起，工人一律怠工。昨日並赴社會局請求調解。</p>

<p>蛋業職工</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕蛋業同行一百餘家職工六百餘人，每月工資咸僅四五千元，不敷生活。已在上月八日向資方要求，增加工資為三萬至六萬元。迄未解決，全體職工乃於前日起實行怠工，然老閩自己仍可賣蛋，不受影響，故職工昨日向社會局請求調解。</p>
<p>電車工人</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕英商電車公司機務部老工人五十七人，勝利前被日人辭退，勝利後即向公司要求復工。遷延迄今無復工音訊。故昨日又至社會局要求調解。</p>
<p>水木工潮</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕水木業工潮，自前晚社會局採取臨時辦法後，已告一段落。昨日工人亦已復工，本約於昨日下午五時繼續商討，然資方未到，故改期再行調解。</p>

<p>昨日紗市尚稱平穩，客銷雖未十分暢達，然零星交易尚見源源而來，二十支中等牌子如大飛艇神虎等紗有人問津，十六支紗去化已不若前此之健俏，因毛中廠家取觀望態度也，二十支雙馬最後價在一百零四五萬之間，投機家似已不感興趣，頗有另求出路之趨向，紡建昨開售花色棉布十三種，並增開美布十二種，今日照例出售蔴毛呢製品云。</p>

<p>救濟署洋米到米價或可望小</p>
<p>昨日米市早疲午定，結果與昨彷彿，麵粉台灣去化已懈，市形站定，油價略見挺秀，價升五六百元至千元不等，豆餅閩帮動而不吒，價各回升一二百元，黃豆交易不多，市勢和平，麩皮亦少榮辱，生仁亦乏軒輊，苞米市化不振，芝蔴到消兩淡，形勢平庸，綿餅菜餅仍無呼吸，各糧暫趨盤旋之狀，倘天氣轉晴，米價或可回小，但救濟署洋米未抵申以前，亦不致過小也。</p>
<h3>煤斤源源而來</h3>
<p>煤斤來源暢通，英輪威林姆傑陀尼號，由秦皇島運來煤斤九千噸，在吳淞口外停泊三天，因碼頭缺乏，三十二·三十三號浮筒，原泊中山號，昨日駛秦島裝煤，該英輪始進口，停泊該浮筒卸煤，又聞燃料管理委員會，在越Portampha埠，採購大量白煤，開始起述來滬，第一艘，Mary　Lyon　號，由該埠運來白煤九千四百噸，約明日可到，又海爾特馬勒本星期二，自滬海防亦至該埠運煤，燃料委員會又在香港，租賃太古公司南昌輪，日內由港直駛該埠運煤來滬，不久有大批白煤到滬，即秦皇島基隆煤，亦源源而來，燃料日漸充足。</p>
<h3>桐油外銷未動　國內外價未接近</h3>
<p>白桐油自外匯規定後，出口交易本可活動，乃因與美國價格未能符合，致出口生意仍在若接若離之間，而產桐區域，近年來因外銷受阻，產量銳減，故到貨未見其旺，價格不能過低，據杭州來訊，在六萬六七千元光景，本市各家批發，雖訂七萬二三千元，但銷不甚暢，恐後市一時不易望好也，洪江桐油聞西副已有到滬。批售各牌價格，每桶在六萬元間。</p>

<p>（一）上海市農產市塲，與偽中央市塲，性質當然不同，農產市塲，爲調濟產銷，平衡供求之組織，冀以合理之制度，謀取抑平物似之正當途徑。</p>
<p>（二）前僞中央市塲所收塲佣，最高至百分之二十八，農產市塲則由監理委員會決定取成交數百分之一之管理費，是否係變相之抽稅，不辯自明。</p>
<p>（三）運由貨物，能入市塲，受統一管理，則可作正確統計，以便協助商民作統購統銷之準備。</p>
<p>（四）市塲爲集中交易之所，於供求兩方，均有絕大之便利，所稱來貨勢必改往外埠一節，顯有抹煞事實之處。</p>
<p>（五）市府佈告，暨本塲通告，係告知有關各業行號，幸勿放棄本身利益，從速參加營業，以期達成設立市塲之使命，原無强迫之處。</p>

<h3>籃球聯賽今晚決戰　華聯薩柯爭天下　七時三刻起在市體育館</h3>
<p>籃球聯賽，華聯與薩柯之決戰，已定於今日下午七時三刻在市體育館展開，此戰無異爲聯賽甲一部之決賽，預料今夜必有空前之盛况，凡我球迷，自應提早前往，俾免向隅。</p>
<p>按華聯在聯賽中，迄猶保持常勝，領導羣雄，薩柯亦迭摧强旅，惜棄權一次，故目下形勢，華聯較爲佔優，不幸而今日失敗，尚可有再戰之希望，薩柯今日如敗，則無復染指希望。按兩隊各有豐當之經騐，可謂棋逢敵手，勝利誰屬，實不易作賽前預言，唯觀乎薩柯前鋒之身材高大，以及其長力充沛，華聯自應覓取所以制止之道，而華聯射籃之順手與否，亦爲今日能否獲勝之大關鍵。兩隊名單如左：</p>
<p>〔華聯〕李震中·孔廣益·包松圓·吳成章·陳學祟·張良雄</p>
<p>〔薩柯〕安特遜·列捷·赫脫萊·當勒·派克·披特遜·康屈朗·高福脫。</p>

<h3>木馬政府是否將在中國出現？　鮑威爾·埃麥德二氏在中美關係座談會廣播詞</h3>
<p>各方面罷工風潮紛至沓來之際，至少有一點光明之屬，呈現於此等壞消息中，斯即中國之內戰聞已停止，長期盼望之國共國結行將告成是也。</p>
<p>果爾，此於絕大多數之美國民衆觀之，不失爲一佳訊。雖吾人不僅佩服中國人民在長期艱苦奮「中所表現之勇敢和耐心，而且多數美國人深悉：中國對吾人之共同敵人作戰，其時間較其他任何盟邦爲久，而從吾人租借法案中所得到之物資援助，則較其他任何盟邦爲少</p>
<p>中國大有進展</p>
<p>從一九二七至一九三七年，此十年間中國進步甚大，由此可見中國古代文化能使其自身適合於新時代條件。日本於一九三七年開始全面侵略戰，即由於長懼此進步所致。由是各種計劃，如全國工業化，爲統一面開闢交通，爲實行民主而推廣敎育等，皆告中輟。爲量甚微之工業與交通綫亦被破壞。雖中國在戰時猶訓練成千成萬之成年人讀書識字，但去實行民主之智識水準尚遠。</p>
<p>因充份民主，須以國家統一及敎育爲先次條件，故中華民國之創造者孫中山先生遂有由國民黨實施訓政直至民主基礎建立爲止之規定。後因戰爭發生，訓政措施因而延擱。</p>
<p>避免內戰恐嚇</p>
<p>當國民黨軍隊遭受日軍猛烈攻擊時，共產黨遂乘機　固其地位，和平之後，後以發動全面內戰相恐嚇，爲避免此種恐嚇之實現，美國用有增無已之壓力，促成妥協，此即今日馬歇爾將軍執行任務之目的也。</p>
<p>據悉團結統一之議將告成功，但相同之傳說，前此已聞之矣。而與以往相同幾至不可克服之困難，仍舊存在。在中國組織任何一個聯合政府，其助能如何·不僅在視其能否調協國共兩黨相互紛歧之處，而在視其能否集中力量，足以應付廣大無比之行政上臨時發生事件。茲將迫待解次諸問題，分述於次：</p>
<p>檢討還都問題</p>
<p>目前第一件事，即是將政府由戰時首都重慶遷回南京。距離一千五百英里，而唯一可用之交通工具，除數量有限之運輸機而外，只能乘船沿揚子江東下。同時，因還都而附帶發生甚爲嚴重之政治上考慮，即在重慶賴政府　給謀生之輩，爲數過鉅是也。</p>
<p>有人曾作此奇想，假使吾人須將首都由華盛頓遷至米蘇里，然後再遷回華盛頓，其唯一交通工具只能乘船下阿海阿，再溯密西西比與米蘇里河而止，則華盛頓之公務員，計將安出？</p>
<p>今將純粹內政事務，包括最嚴重之救濟間題，存而不論，並將蘇聯在滿洲所造成之困難局面亦暫時置之度外，則中國所遭遇之嚴重問題，即在根據抗戰期間所訂新約，重行調整與外國之關係，及考慮外國在華利益是。頃獲悉法國前欲放棄之領事裁判權，今已不願放棄，聲言條約尚未簽字，美英則已放棄領事裁判權矣。</p>
<p>外國商號，擬在嶄新情况之下再行開業，但據報告，現方感覺相富困難，中國堅持一切洋行必須根據中國法律之規定，重新註册，若干有關外國人則謂在此等法規下，洋行無法開辦。</p>
<p>上述不過爲政府所面臨各種問題之一部份，但一切問題與政治上之富有爆炸物一事相關聯。共產黨攻擊政府所用短棒之一，即謂中央政府過分爲外國人作工具，尤其是爲美國及不列顚人。中國紅軍於戰事發端之初，即抨擊重慶政府爲美英之傀儡政府。</p>
<p>在中國與共產黨謀團結一事，必須就需要一强有力政府解決特殊建設問題一點上加以考慮，蔣委員長究能放棄其控制權與其自孫中山先生所繼承之黨之控制權至何等地步，而行政系統不致發生較今日更大之破壞，誠爲疑問。因爲訓政時期尚未完成，必需之行政控制權能否與中共平安共享？此外，尚有民主同盟，不過此黨乃智識份子凑合而成，組織力量甚爲微弱，其眞有資格組織政府者，惟國民黨或共產黨，或國共兩黨聯合。</p>
<p>共黨加入政府</p>
<p>蔣委員長是否讓共產黨加入政府，此一問題，正與戴高樂在法國解決失敢之困難問題相同。二者對照，瞭解自易，雖法國爲一前進民主國家，而選民之智識程度亦高，然在戰前猶因行政機構權力太弱，而大受其害，此即被納粹擊潰原因之一。戰後戴高樂與其同志在第四共和國之下，草訂新憲法，增强行政機構之權力，使民主政府可以安定。節言之，戴高樂所草憲法，大體仿照美國總統制，將大權集中於總統之手，非常時期則授總統更大權力。</p>
<p>在新憲法實施以前，戴高樂復爲執行行政之總統，規定若干過渡時期之職權。戴高樂將軍願意讓共產黨黨員加入其內閣，並已令其加入。但渠拒絕共產黨員祖任與外交政策及國防有關之閣員。因共產黨效忠外國政府，不能信任故也。戴高樂出于此種態度，遂被共產黨迫令辭職。</p>
<p>假定戴高樂之立塲合乎邏輯，並能獲得法國及全世界民主主義者之贊助，則蔣委員長對共產黨態度之堅定，其理由將更充份正大乎？中國共產黨有軍隊，而法國共產黨無之，法俄邊疆相去百數十英哩，而中俄毗連之境界，則較全世界任何兩鄰國之邊境爲長。</p>
<p>平素專爲共產黨辯護者，謂中國共產黨非爲克思主義者，並與莫斯科方面毫無關係。又謂中國共產黨員只是純檏農民，僅對農民福利之改善感覺興趣，吾人於此其能置信乎？</p>
<p>最近當中國紅軍在內蒙古邊境，北平西北，奪得一軍略據點－張家口－時，彼等之行動表現另一種動機，此在前鋒論壇報，史迪爾先生已著妙文說明之矣。紅軍在張家口所用之方法，酷似一九二七年共產黨參加國民革命時所慣用之赤色恐怖主義。此種赤色恐怖主義，對於國民黨與當時領導中國共產黨之俄人托洛斯基終於破裂，實不能辭其咎。中國共產黨近來在張家口所行所爲，紐約時報曾著下列一段社評諷刺之：</p>
<p>「當中國共產黨奮得一所縣城時，彼等所作之第一件事，即逮捕其仇人，如認爲必要，並將其槍斃，其次則將土地分給人民，並宣佈增加工資百分之百，又其次則設立秘密警察及集中營，彼等僅允許刋印公報及官方文件，禁止一切反對集會。當君讀及此時，切勿將彼等誤認爲共產黨員，彼等乃中國之純樸農人。」</p>
<p>「彼等非共產黨而是改革家」，此種聲明，自吾人與中國社會接觸後，聞之熟矣。而法南國斯拉夫，墨西哥，美國巴西等處之共產黨，亦曷嘗不作此同一聲明，蓋今日之共產黨，無一墨守過去共產黨之陳法，彼等爲達成其策略起見，不惜與巴西之頑固獨裁者瓦爾迦斯，紐約之民主黨頑固份子（Tammary　elements），及南斯拉夫以前之法西斯蒂主義者合作。</p>
<p>故考察一現代共產黨，不在其對馬克思效忠，而在其對史太林效忠。此戴高樂將軍之所以拒絕予共產黨黨員以重要閣員位置也。</p>
<p>强迫蔣委員長如此作，豈于美國有利乎乎？</p>
<p>林語堂覆史諾</p>
<p>林語堂在一九四五年三月廿四日出版國家雜誌上，爲答覆史諾對其所著“Vigil　of　Nation”一書所作書評，曾就中國共黨所發表之會論，作如下之總結：</p>
<p>「假如有人以爲中國共產黨與其他各國共產黨有相類之處，乃爲希奇之事，則中共對莫斯科效忠之紀載，定能所認爲希奇者。將不爲希奇矣。當史太林與希特勒携手之際，中共嚴守孤立態度毛澤東（一九三五－四三年爲中共執行委員）極端排美排英，如有人將屯等事實忽略報告，吾決不能予以原諒。希特勒在與蘇聯訂立友好條約以前，被駡爲「瘋狗」，在條約存續期間內被尊爲國家元首，一九四一年六月廿二日以後復成爲可鄙視之畜生，吾能列舉重慶新華日報一打以上之社評及其日期，一九四一年五月廿一日之「不參加歐戰」，內容爲何？此文發表日期去六月廿二日僅四十日，亦云奇矣。一九四〇年四月廿五日之「某一條死路」內容爲何？此文即在呼籲參加歐戰。毛澤東要求絕對中立，並指摘羅斯福對英之租借法案爲假中立，企圖將美國牽入第二次帝國主義者戰爭。共產黨允許史太林承認日「滿」邊境毛澤東稱英美帝國主義者爲「淫婦之子」，在新民主主義論第四十五面上駡日本帝國主義者亦用此同一名調。凡謂英美究與日本帝國主義有別者，毛決厭惡之」</p>
<p>最近中國紅軍領袖毛澤東曾寫一小册子，題爲「論新民主主義。」在紐約出版之流行本，曾有美國已被開除之共黨領袖布勞特爾爲之作序。此書乃中國共產黨之最近言論，勉勵一切忠實共產黨努力自修，不論其國籍爲何。書中要義，被在美之中國紅軍發言人及演講者引用甚廣。簡言之，毛著是書之主旨，在闡明紅軍領袖對協商之意見及民主與共產主義之原則。</p>
<p>最近從美國人（其中有一位爲天主敎神父）所搜集之硏究資料中，獲得一本宣傳小册子，此書將使任何熟悉共產黨宣傳策略之人爲之驚奇。在美行銷之中文原本，於材料方面，與在華行銷之本稍異。</p>

<h3>中美友誼關係</h3>
<p>時間不允許對上列兩書作詳盡檢討，但毛澤東於指斥民主家國，包括中美英，爲資產階級血的軍事獨裁者時，常提及Original一字。</p>
<p>關於中美友誼，常然蘇聯在外，毛謂中國將處於傀儡地位，與汪精衛南京僞組織相同。毛於全書中表示極端痛恨民主國家，並謂中國加入民主國同盟，已入人彀中。彼謂在戰時與民主國合作，並不蛟「侍候上帝兼侍財神」爲更可能。</p>
<p>此書要義在回答「中國共產黨是否爲眞正共產黨」一問題，毛之答案爲，彼等是眞正共產黨，其痛恨美國民主政體與其所生之作用，可謂毫無問題矣。</p>
<p>吾人已知戴高樂之在上次大選中雖獲有大多數法國民衆支持－－相信蔣委員長亦能獲得大多數人民支持——仍無濟於事，戴以爲非法國議會授彼以大權，並在新憲內如此明文規定，彼將不能仗多數人民之擁護，反對組織嚴密，而又有外國援助之少數共產黨，以繼續統治法國。</p>
<p>由上所述，可見吾人勉强要蔣委員長給予中共以一部份政權，足以迫令中國投入蘇聯勢力圈，而永遠不再回頭。中美友誼·吾人素所倡導之門戶開放政策，將因是而犧牲。</p>
<p>中共對吾人之觀感，不僅用語言及印刷品，且在華北美軍地帶已用軍事行動表明之矣。中國共產黨不要吾人在亞洲方面之帮助，彼等只需蘇聯合作。故有一部份學生要求美軍退出中國，遣送美軍返國，其用意在此。今吾人復逢昔日共產黨孤立派同盟之再起，彼等於希特勒史太林携手期內曾儘量阻止美國援助中英。</p>
<p>美國在華駐軍曾被共軍奇襲，美國飛行員曾被紅軍射擊，美國飛行員曾被扣留於紅軍區內。凡此皆較一切事爲重要。按美國陸海軍被含有敵意之中國軍隊射擊，乃半世紀前拳匪作亂以後第一次。當吾人欲强迫在戰爭期間，與吾人作戰，而且爲吾人作戰之中國國民政府，容納共產黨時，則對是類事件不得不嚴重考慮。</p>
<p>較良之政策，（此政策行之猶未爲晚，）即是强迫共產黨讓步，而不用强迫蔣委員長，假使吾人支持蔣委員長所必需之基本權威與其合法政府，吾人將有更大力量，促成國民黨內部政治組織之改革—此政黨現包含腐化與頑固份子在內—共產然在中國之勢力愈加强，蔣委員長及排共自由主義者，愈將依賴頑固份子，以圖阻止共產黨之篡奪政權。多數中國人民，一如其他民族，寗願讓頑固或腐敗政治存在，而不願有「木馬政府」（即外國獨裁者指揮下之中國傀儡政府）之出現也。（唐昌晋譯）自由談滿好的」！</p>
<h3>隨馬帥視察散記（三）</h3>
<p>— 北平特派員張劍梅寄</p>
<p>毛夫人：延安之花</p>
<p>本報十二日航訊</p>
<p>毛夫人江靑，是延安的一朶鮮花，八年來塞上的風沙，不曾摧折了他的風韵，依然美麗動人，穿不扣扣的松黃色將校呢大衣。裏面是嶄新的灰呢西裝，像是剛燙過的，胸前露出的毛背心，像敷上一層雪。他告訴我們他是上月十九號同周恩來一道從重慶回延安的，比報上登的晚了兩天。「重慶有一個缺點」她頭髮輕輕一揚，伸出右手做手勢「就是陽光太少」！「那麽延安的氣候好嗎」？「還好，這裏氣候比較乾燥——可是我是一個生長在海洋氣候地帶的」，「那麼你希望不希望回到上海呢」，她有點忸怩了「我希望如此」，有位明友開玩笑的講「妳好好勸促勸促毛先生到南京，你就能回上海」，了牠不好意思的媽然一笑「如果有機會，你願意不願意再度出現於舞台銀幕」？她攷慮了一下說：「我們的組織要我作甚麼工作，我就作甚麼。」她看了看記者的名片是代表申報的，就問：「申報現在還是每天出一大疊子嗎」說時用大姆指和食指比劃了一下申報的張數之多之厚，「申報的</p>
<h3>蔡大姐　暢談婦運</h3>
<p>延安有名的「蔡大姐」（名蔡暢，李富春夫人）吃飯時和我們同桌，她是延安歸運領袖，去年全國代表大會時當選爲中共中央委員。她說中共目前婦女運動工作的重點，是指導鄉村婦女努力農業生產，讓他們知道助產和育嬰知識，（特別注意助產的改良，因爲邊區的人口死亡率尤其嬰兒婦女的死亡率很大）帮助家庭的穩定，並不鼓勵離婚。記者問「這不是回復到良妻賢母主義了嗎」？他的回答是：「那要看是在那一種意義之下」分明的，中共在貧瘡的農村的統治，也需要千千萬萬良妻賢母型的「農婦」做他的支柱的。</p>
<p>日本投降以後，延安的文化人紛紛東走張家口，差不多是只撇下艾思奇陳伯達張仲實等很少幾個人在看家了。艾思奇從他的公務員型的面孔和棉軍服上一點看不出哲學家的派頭，這些年他沒有出什麼大部頭書，只是努力於把一些適於中共需要的政策綱領，加以民族形式的泡製，灌輸到農民士兵羣衆裏去。陳伯達頸裏勒一條白毛巾，權代圍巾。張仲實同樣一身棉軍服，他說來到邊區幾年，自己可以專心寫作研究，不必躭心生活問題，困爲一切需用的東西都是發的。</p>
<h3>羅秘書　大談政情</h3>
<p>在這裏讓我寫一點陜甘寗邊區的政情吧。邊區政府秘書長羅邁說，陝甘寗邊區面積九萬方公里，現劃爲廿九縣一市，人口一百五十萬，軍隊三萬，行政人負在一萬五千至一萬八千間，全區每年產糧百六十萬石，人民負担公糧不到百分之十，——最早救國公糧每年二十萬石，後來因軍政人員的生產自給運動，卅二年减爲十八萬石，卅三年减爲十六萬石，去年减爲十二萬石。過去的食聖公營代金（過去人民須爲政府運鹽，自己不能爲政府運的出食鹽公營代金）今年已經免去。人民負担已漸减輕。農業方面，這些年來作到的只是鄉村的勞働條件組織一下（耕牛，勞力，耕具，種子），不使浪費。工業方面，政府竭力提倡種棉紡織，去干種卅萬畝綿花，收獲二十多萬担棉花，再有兩三年，邊區棉花可望自給。他不　言，邊幣的通貨膨脹已到了驚人的程度。目前　區小米一石的値價是邊幣四十萬元，一個中學敎員每月獲得糧食約爲一石二斗至一石五斗，若折算邊幣爲四十八萬至六十萬元，比着後方公務人員拿到法幣薪水的數目還要驚人，這種猛烈的通貨膨脹，使他們感覺印刷邊幣的不敷應用，所以又仿關金辦法，由貿易公司另外發行了一種同關金相仿的流通劵，一元流通劵等於廿元邊幣（陜甘寗邊區銀行發行的），目前流通劵的票面有十元，百元，二百元，二百五十元，一千元，以至二千元，（法幣用邊幣的比率目前是一比十，用流通劵的比率是〇，五比一元，你算算吧！）其通貨膨脹的程度較之法幣實有過之而無不及，邊區政府對此問題相當頭疼，羅秘書長志實的說：「這麽多的邊幣流通券我們實無力收回，將來希望中央護法收回」。</p>
<p>和平了，延安向何處去？前時報載，毛澤東已經在南京找房了。有人說，重慶十延安＝南京，似是也有糾正這個公式爲重慶十延安十華盛頓＝南京，</p>
<p>延安神秘的色彩將要在和平的洪流中冲淡了，明天此日也許再沒有新聞記者去延安了。</p>

<h3>讀者意見　處理戰前公債　應有優待辦法</h3>
<p>主筆先生：</p>
<p>國家補救財政困難之方法不外增加租稅，增發紙幣及發行公債。增加租稅則時間上太慢。增發紙幣則易引起通貨膨脹。發行公債則可收縮通貨，吸收遊資，使人民得到投資的途徑。故發行公債爲救濟財政困難之良好方法。</p>
<p>吾國於民國二十五年發行統一公債五種。總額爲七萬五千萬元。距今十年，通貨因戰事關係而膨脹。如果政府仍以原數償還本息。則無異國家向人民賴債。然而國家之賴去外債者在歷史上先例甚多，而賴去岡內公債者尚未前見·即第一次按界大戰後之德國，雖為戰敗國然在整理幣制時亦有優待辦法價付公債。而今我國爲勝利國對戰後整理幣制時之公債，豈有不加優待之理。蓋人民為國家之本，國家失去人民之信仰心，則以後如有財政困難之時發行公債將不易推銷矣。</p>
<p>發行孫票當局一再聲明全為謠傳。然整理幣制乃國家求取進步在通貨膨脹後不可不採取之步驟。宋院長在政治報告中亦曾說明在「物價平穩後，始可整理幣制」等語。所以取締投機是一回事，處理公債是一回事，二者不可混爲一談。希望賢明當局速籌妥善辦法處理戰前公價。勿再使全國人民失去愛國信仰之心。要知在戰前人民投資於公債者，很多作爲儲蓄金及養老金之用。在此抗戰期內非但利息分文未得，而今勝利後仍如取得貶値之法幣，豈非使對國家熱心投資者予以嚴重之打擊乎。（張培珩）</p>
<h3>罷工怠工何其愚笨</h3>
<p>攤開近幾月來的報紙，怠工罷工的消息幾於無日無之，員工爲了生活，出此下策，確是情非得已，不過牠的結果仍是得不償失因爲在過去國難時期，資本家們趁着交通阻塞，物資缺乏，投機囤積，操縱市面，他們利潤是以幾倍幾倍計的，現在雖勝利了，他們發財心理仍未稍變，我們做員工的要求改善待遇，等於挖他們肉，決不肯爽快答應的，即便允許了，也是羊毛出在羊身上，把貨價提高，利息增厚；甚至他們的加碼，超出他們付出的數字。在他們對外說起來是：「爲了維持員工生活，不得已而加價。」我們員工呢，工資是增加了幾許，而一切物價反加了幾倍，開支又大了，仍然活不落，所以爲了生活而罷工——爲了調整待遇而加價——爲了物價高漲生活不安而罷工——這樣一來，罷工怠工的事體成了週期性的險症，此伏彼起，彼伏此起，一時不易解決。</p>
<p>鄙意在這靑黃不接時期，我們要明瞭各個人的立塲，我們要吃苦耐勞，我們不必存什麽奢望，我們不必仰面去請求資方來改善待遇，我們可以在各個本位上來監視資方，不許他們借端加價，不許他們獲過份利潤。此如在工廠裏的，我們可以把原料進價，製造費用，以及一切開支等計算他的成本，再加上合法利潤，就作爲批發價，請求廠方賣出時勿超出這價値，在商店公司銀行裏的，也可照此辦法，除合法利潤外，不得招高售價，以及非法的高利貸。倘若資方不能接受我們的請求，就可把事實揭露出來，讓社會制裁。我認爲在這種辦法，祗要幾個大工廠，大商店，大公司，大銀行的員工們，上下一致去實行，不怕威脅，不被利誘，在短期內全市物價可能普遍下降。我們爲了社會安寗，爲了大衆生活，來執行這種工作，社會人士一定對我們表同情的。</p>

<h3>中國應該參加　國際版權公約</h3>
<p>— 袁達</p>
<p>這次抗戰勝利，中國成爲五强之一。我們爲適應這個新得的榮譽和地位起見，有許多方而實在應該急起直追，以免仍舊處於洛伍和落後的地位。</p>
<p>其中有一件和中國的作家和出版界有直接關係的，就是中國應該趕快參加國際版權公約。這對著作家和出版家有利害關係，對整個國家有地位和信譽的關係。</p>
<p>最近被美國政府禮聘出國講學的我國作家舒舍予（老舍）先生，有一本名呌『駱駝祥子』的小說被譯成英文，在美國出版，成爲暢銷書之一。這在中國和老舍先生個人，可以說是很光榮的事了。老舍先生的生活，幾十年來一直在艱窘中過去，甚至弄得患貧血和營養不良的病。這在堅貞卓絕的老舍先生也許無所謂，但是他的親友和愛好文學的讀者，實在看不過去。此次出國以前，筆者曾跟他談到『駱駝祥中』這譯本的版稅問題，他表示這件事他沒有發言的餘地，因爲中國根本沒有參加岡際版權公約，因此在法律上，我們是沒有地位可以向人家要版稅的。因此這本書原著者該得多少版稅，祗好隨譯者給。而現在老舍先生的家屬，止靠着那位譯者所給的一筆有限的版稅作生活費的一部。</p>
<p>中國應該參加國際版權公約的原因，並不單單爲了要使我國作家的版權得有保障，可以取得應得的版稅；更重要的，是要使中國和中國的著作家，翻譯家，和出版家，能够像樣地在國際上站立起來，待到國際的重視和信譽。</p>
<p>我們布望中國的文化界和出版界人士，會注意到這個問題。</p>
<h3>民主憲政論</h3>
<p>— 平凡</p>
<p>作者：陳啓天</p>
<p>出版：商務印書館</p>
<p>日期：三十三年重慶</p>
<p>三十四年十月上海增訂版</p>
<p>頁數：二百十九頁</p>
<p>民主政治是現代世界文化的主潮，這潮流在中國正澎湃之中。可惜一般人祗拿「民主」兩字　做一種政治活動的口號，而對於民主的眞諦認識淸楚，誠非國家之福，領導靑年活動的人和喜歡作政治社會活動的靑年們對於這一方面還有正確了解的必要。了解的方法是多研究這一類的書，不祗是把全副的精力花費在某一種政治的主義，或死釘住某幾個人跑，本人介紹這一本書就是想在這一方面眞正替中國的靑年做一點事。</p>
<p>全書分十三章，各章原係單獨發表者，故似缺乏體系性。但理論一貫，風趣相同。第七章是說明中國近五十年來致力於憲政述動的發展。第一章討論民主憲政與政治建設的關係。陳先生認爲政冶是全盤國是的總樞紐，而民主憲政是中國政治建設的總方針。他在初版自序中說：「要求建國成功，非實行民主憲政不可；要求人人能做人，非實行民主政憲不可；要求人人能救國，更菲實行民主憲政不可·」第二章　關於民主憲政的實施問題。主要的問題是戰時是否要實施，這已經不成問題了，所以不必再介　了。</p>
<p>第三章是說明民主憲二政的原則。（一）新政治是公人政治而不是私人政治。所謂公人是指一種有才學而確能公事公辦的人，不問其有與私人關係，也不隨私人關係而進退。（二）新政治是公法政治而不是私法政治，是運用「天下之法」，非「于家之法」。（三）新政治是公利政治而不是私利政治。（四）是公理政治而非强權政治。（五）是民治政治而非官治政治。（六）是實踐的政治而非虛僞政治。</p>
<p>第四章是討論何爲民生憲政的風度。作者以爲一個眞正從事於民主憲政的政治家一定要遵守的八個信條：（一）應不以外援做背景。「純粹的外國黨派固絕對不得在本國從事政治活動。即本國的黨派也不宜假借外援，從事內爭。……又黨派以外援爲背景，則必使國家陷於分裂，成爲一黨一國，爾死我活，各不相下，如何談得上民主憲政呢」？（二）應不以武力做後盾。眞正民主憲政的國家一切的軍隊必須一律是國防軍，祇可對外，不可對內。（三）應不以陰謀做手段，一切從事政治活動者都應以公開的態度相處·（四）應不以專利爲目的。任何黨派，其方法雖不同，但最後目標都應爲本國國民諜幸福·「分　政治尚且不可，專利政治尤英不可」。（五）一切政治活動者必須尊重民意。須允許人民對於政治有言論出版集會結新的自由。（六）必須尊重公道。「只許自己過問政治，不許他人渦問政治，便是不平等，也便是不公這」。所以一切政治活動者都應兼有公平競賽和相互寬容的兩種精神。（七）一切政治活動必須尊重法紀。法紀是民主憲政的公共軌道。法紀之內人人皆有自出。在法紀前人人必須平等而無特權階級。命令不得變更法律，法律不得變更憲法。（八）必須尊重責任。故在民主憲政之下必須設有法定的民意機關以課行政機關的責任。行政機關必須尊重民意機關，才是尊重責任。</p>
<p>第五章作者申述民主政治與非民主政治的分別。他說，第一民主政治要有一個全民共有的政府；第二，民主政治旣只要一個民有的政府則政府自須由人民治理，以建立一個民治的政府；第三，在民主政治中沒有統治階級與被統治階級的區別，而成爲一種民享的政府；第四，在民主政治下的政府，旣爲人民所有，所治，所享，則人民易與政府合為一體。從這些特點中我們發覺民主政治較一切非民主政治爲合理，諾和而穩固，實是一種長治久安的政體。</p>
<p>第六章講民主政治的哲學背　。這裏作者又分兩方面討論。一方而講民主政治的政治哲學，一方面講民主政治的人生哲學。在政治哲學中他說明幾個基本理論。（一）國家與政府應嚴格劃分；（二）應是人民自己統治自己，使統治與被治兩相交錯；（三）人民應有權力和自由，而分屬於全體；（四）法治與人治合而爲一；（五）在民主政治中一方而須建立一種秩序，另一方面須不斷改造以朮進步。至於民主政治的人生哲學應含有三大要義：（一）羣已相涵；（二）人我一體；（三）德智雙修。民主的人格要有五個要件：（一）獨立精神，（二）協作精神，（三）奮鬥精神，（四）正直精神，（五）實踐精神。</p>
<p>第九章說明怎樣才能完成一種民主的政治規模。這裏作者說，（一）公事與私事應明白分別。（二）政府與黨派應有分明。在多黨制度下政務官隨黨派進退而進退以明政治責任，這是可以的，甚至於是必要的。不過文官應超黨派性，（三）民意與官意不同。使民意與官意分明的方法，須許容並尊重反對黨在議會中的批評與監督。（四）政治應與軍事分明。若有人用秘密手段與暴力手段去解決政治問題，則政爭便成了內戰，不足以言政治。（五）司法與行政應分開。這要廢除司法行政不分的傳統，不能濫用軍法，不使黨派活動侵入法院，不得任意秘密逮捕，拘禁，並處罰人民的秘密機關。</p>
<p>晨後作者論及政治的成敗時，他以爲（一）態度開明與時俱進步的政治則易成功。（二）以天下爲公的政治則易成功，否則必失敗。（三）容許民意輿論與反對派批評監督的政治則易成功，否則必敗。（四）法律有威信的政治易成功。（五）善用權力的政治易成功；濫用權力的政治必敗。</p>
<p>民主不僅是一種新政治而且是一種新生活；不僅是一種新制度，而且是一種新風度；不僅是一種新知識，而且是一種新習慣。所以我們不僅注重在新政治，新制度，和新知識方面，我們更要注重新生活，新風度和新習慣。這需要我們一切去學習的。至於學習的方法應注意兩點：（一）須在爭取民主中學習民主；（二）須在實行民主中學習民主。</p>
<p>第八章介紹羅素的近著權力論，兼及民主政治與中國政治，似應列入附錄。其他任章多重覆處俱略而不論。欲窺全豹，請閱原書。</p>
<h3>讀「中學訓育」</h3>
<p>— 吳子嘉</p>
<p>最近我以幾個晚工的時間，讀完楊同芳先生所著的「中學訓育」，覺得確有獨到見解。該書係世界書局刊行，列爲新敎育叢書，出版已三年了，惟因當時被敵僞查封，勝利後才解封發售。</p>
<p>談到敎育改造，許多人都主張要從中學敎育下手，因爲這時期敎育的對象，是身心發展劇速的靑年，他們需要基本的學識和豐富的生活，前者屬於知能的灌輸，而後者則爲德育的陶冶。可知在中學校中，「敎」與「訓」應同樣重視，我國中學敎育的失敗，大抵由於「敎」與「訓」的分離，（要「教」「訓」合一自然不是單靠把「敎務處」和「訓育處」合併而爲「教導處」所可生效的。）和傳統的訓育方法不良。</p>
<p>本書强調「敎」「訓」兩者的關係，針對民族的弱點和社會的需要，提供出改進中學訓育的方法，使我們認淸訓育的目標和實施的步驟。著者硏究敎育有素，能够丟棄那些機械板滯的原則，以正確的理論爲根據，說出他對改進訓育的意見，雖全書章節分得很多，然而仍然可以讓我們尋出一個中心思想：訓育是生活的全部，牠不僅是消極的管理，必須啓迪學生的道德理想，謀健全人格的培養。訓育的過程，應山外部的，定律的，而到內部的，自律的。除非把訓育貫注到學生整個的生活中去，次不會受到眞正的效果。</p>
<p>中學訓育的範圍甚大，所涉學科有敎育，心理，倫理，社會，哲學，等門，凡足以影響學生行爲的諸因素，均不能不顧及，以前尚無此項有系統的專著出版，而英美出版的又不盡適合國情，所以這部研討中學訓育原理與實施的著作，在今日到是很需用的。關於中學生生理與心理的狀態，社會與倫理各方面的因素，以及中學訓育的哲學基礎，均有闡述。還有中學訓育和敎學的關聯，各學科的道德效用，課外活動與學生自治也都有詳盡的討論，且引誰不少實際的材料。靑年訓練問題，特列一章，述各國靑年訓練的現狀及今後中國靑年訓練應取的途徑。性敎育在中學訓育佔極重要的地位，也作了明確的叙說，並着重實施方法，可以打破一般中學敎師的傳統思想。書中對我國中學訓育的缺陷說得很透關，更將現行各種訓育制度的優劣加以比較，指出今後應如何確定訓育目標和方法。</p>
<p>我感到這本書最大的優點在滲透了新興的心理衛生的知識，說明了怎樣運用心理衛生的原則於訓育實施。關於這點，不但在第三章內叙說得很多，即其他各章亦能充分應用心理衛生的原理，材料堪稱新頴。雖如著者所說該書可作敎本之用，但我到認爲沒有一般「敎本」的枯燥，就是硏究靑年問題的人也應該看一下。</p>
<p>現在的中國，已經踏上建國的階段，我們首先必須培育那些未來担當建國重任的青年，特別是介於小學與大學之開的中學生，使他們都能成爲有健全人格，有高尚理想，肯進取肯犧牲的建國前衛。負訓導靑年之責者！應如何順遜青年心理，體察國家需要，以積極的合理的訓育方法去指導這般民族的新鮮細胞—靑年們，使成爲身心健全的公民，實爲當前最大的需要。讀了「中學訓育」，我想到這些問題。</p>
<h3>中華民國外交史（一）</h3>
<p>— 梅汝璈</p>
<p>張忠紱編著　正中書局出版大學用書</p>
<p>卅四年十一月滬一版　二十五開本四百三十頁</p>
<p>本文作者梅汝璈先生爲我國法學家權威，歷任中政中大敎授立法院立法委員等要職。近時麥帥在柬京成立遠東審理戰犯國際法庭，梅先生榮任我國首席審判官。最近來滬轉日，蒙百忙中撰此，以實本刋，無任感幸。</p>
<p>直至現在爲止，才發現比較好的中國外交史，這就是張忠紱先生所著的中華民國外交史。張先生歷任南開大學敎授，國立北京大學政治系主任多年，近任軍委會參事兼外交部美洲司司長，學識經騐，俱臻上乘，所著「英日同盟」一書，早已膾炙人口，傳誦一時，爲西洋硏究外交者所不可少的參考名著。本書係張先生多年研究和講學心得之結晶，其爲有價値之作品，不言可喩。可惜的是現在才出了上卷，下卷問世，尚屬有待。據作者在自序裏說：「論述所及，僅自一九一一年（辛亥革命）起，至一九二一年（華盛頓會議）止」。這短短的十年，是中國「多事之秋」。作者用此一時期的國內政治，國際局勢，歷史淵源，輿論向背，以及人物性格等等爲背景，以最穩妥最科學的「史的觀察」，客觀地正確描摩中國外交的波瀾起伏，深入淺出，引人人勝。本書取材極廣，例如列國承認問題，參戰問題等等，均曾言前人之所未言；旁徵博引，都　是出諸信史。至於文筆之謹嚴，附注之詳明，尤其餘事。如謂蔣廷黻先生爲硏究淸代外交之權威，則張忠紱先生應爲硏究民國以來外交史之權威。張先生這一本霄的問世，實爲我國戰時學術界出版界一件深可慶幸之事。我想凡是研究外交歷史或國際政治的學人，讀本書以後，必定會發生同樣的感覺。</p>
<h3>敎科書恐慌？</h3>
<p>— 本報記者</p>
<p>最近有許多中小學學生說跑遍了書店買不到敎枓書，買了國文，缺少歷史，有了算術，又沒有地理。爲了要明白其中的原因，兩天內遍訪了商務，中華，世界，正中，大東，開明，獨立七家書店，所謂「七家聯合供應處」便是。</p>
<p>收復區日漸擴大，敎科書的需要量當然日益增多，負責全國中小學敎科書供應的機關「七聯處」，在上海成立機構，供給東南三省兩市的需要。後來靑島聞封等地也向上海來配購，有一時期便感到支絀。但歸納各家的意見，一致認爲恐慌的情形並不如何嚴重。因爲這情形只是個別的，並不是普遍的。可能缺少某幾種，某幾册，或者某家缺少，另一家却有多。他們相信：只要能够充份配得白報紙，這一種情形次不至出現於下學期，</p>
<p>現在在敎有局策導之下，凡買不到書的學校可以向敎育局去登記，三月十五日截止，十六日開始發給，但是去登記的只有二十所學校，數量還不到一萬本，可見恐慌的情形已經過去。</p>
<p>希望當局在下學期有週密的統計及計劃，則這次敎科書缺乏的恐慌當不致重現。</p>

<h3>Resolution on Military Demobilization Work; Urging Attention to National Defense Construction; Improving the Treatment of Officers and Soldiers and Implementing Meritorious Awards</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] The resolution on military demobilization work passed at the 17th meeting of the Second Plenary Session on the morning of the 15th is as follows:</p>
<p>Resolution on Military Demobilization Work</p>
<p>The meeting listened to the report on military demobilization work and the proposals of the members, and after detailed deliberation, it was considered that the military and political authorities were able to determine the plan and earnestly implement it in accordance with the instructions of the Supreme Commander in all aspects of the military demobilization. In particular, the reorganization of the army has been carried out effectively, and all of our officers and soldiers have been able to deeply understand the meaning of justice, obey orders, and comply with the implementation. The proposals of the members are mostly pertinent and meet the needs, which is gratifying. This eight-year war of resistance against Japan enabled the enemy to surrender unconditionally and achieved the final victory, thanks to the loyalty, bravery, and struggle of all our officers and soldiers who fulfilled their duties. However, at a time when lasting world peace has not yet been firmly established, the survival of our nation and the guarantee of national independence still depend on a substantial national defense force, and the guarantee of international peace also depends on the strength of peace-loving countries to safeguard peace. Therefore, in the future, special attention should be paid to national defense construction and preferential treatment of national soldiers. In view of the current situation and looking forward to the future, the following points should be noted:</p>
<p>(1) Active Construction of Modern National Defense Modern national defense must integrate the army, navy, and air force to unify its construction and command in order to ensure consistent steps and exert overall effectiveness. The military foundation should be based on industry and science, especially focusing on air force construction. As for the conscription system and its organization, it must be vigorously improved to achieve soundness so that a minimum number of standing armies can be retained in peacetime, and sufficient troops can be rapidly mobilized when necessary to meet actual needs. The training and reserve of reserve officers must also be established and properly implemented.</p>
<p>(2) Substantial Improvement of the Treatment of Officers and Soldiers The hardship of the lives of officers and soldiers has reached its extreme. If it is not substantially improved, it will not only reduce morale and affect discipline, but also make it impossible to improve the quality of the army, which will hinder the future of army building. The relevant government departments should improve it as soon as possible in accordance with the following principles: (a) The treatment of officers and soldiers should be compared to that of civil servants in order to achieve fairness. (b) Staple and non-staple foods and horse feed should be provided publicly, and the established plan of in-kind subsidies should be implemented. If a part must be paid in cash, it should also be paid in full according to market prices. (c) Military uniforms should be made publicly for officers and distributed at a fixed price, and soldiers should be given full public provision. (d) Irregular forces (guerrilla forces, advancing armies, etc.) should be quickly reorganized. If they cannot be reorganized immediately due to special circumstances, they should be temporarily paid living expenses to maintain their lives. (e) The army should gradually equip fixed barracks and pay attention to conservation, thereby isolating them from residents in order to facilitate management and education.</p>
<p>(3) Proper Settlement of Demobilized Officers and Soldiers Demobilized officers and soldiers should be given preferential treatment and properly settled. The government should formulate a plan for (receiving, educating, nurturing, and using) in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's policy on military industry, land reclamation, and career change, so that they can engage in national production and construction during peacetime, each in their own place, and each living in peace, and that they can be mobilized and recalled during wartime to remain loyal and brave soldiers defending the territory, so that demobilization work can proceed smoothly, and local order can be stabilized.</p>
<p>(4) Earnestly Handle Meritorious Awards, Pensions, Commendations, and Relief Matters Officers and soldiers who have fought loyally and bravely during the war of resistance against Japan should be given meritorious awards. Wounded and disabled soldiers should be properly settled, and their families should be given relief. The officers and soldiers who died in battle and their orphans should be carefully investigated and commended and given pensions separately, so that meritorious deeds must be rewarded, awards must be given for meritorious deeds, the dead can rest in peace, and the living can be supported, so as to conform to the state's purpose of rewarding merit and encouraging loyalty. The procedures should also be simplified as much as possible in order to obtain practical benefits.</p>
<h3>Requesting the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to Increase the Amount of Food Allocated</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 15th] Today, the Second Plenary Session announced a resolution requesting the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to increase the amount of food allocated to China in order to relieve famine in various parts of the country. In addition, it also requested the administration to assist China in purchasing rice from various regions in Southeast Asia and wheat from the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] The Second Plenary Session today proposed that the government reduce the rations for Japanese prisoners of war and prohibit the use of rice, wheat, sorghum, and other grains for brewing alcohol in order to alleviate the shortage of food for the people.</p>
<h3>United States to Transfer Eight Warships; Sailing to China on April 1st</h3>

<h3>Character Sketches of the Second Plenary Session</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Chongqing Special Correspondent Zhao Haosheng</p>
<p>President Chiang attended the opening ceremony and the two memorial weeks, wearing military uniform. Each time, he entered from the right side door of the venue and stood on the rostrum. Under the illumination of the mercury lamps, his demeanor was particularly radiant, his face was full of benevolence, as if he was sitting in a family reunion. When delivering his speech, his tone was firm and forceful, every word was like cutting iron, with cadence and inflection, full of infinite power and moving emotion. When reading the will of the Founding Father and the party member code of conduct, he spoke slowly and clearly, which was thought-provoking, and his emotions were full in his words. Each time the ceremony was completed and the music was played, the President stood solemnly in front of the seat, and finally returned the salute to everyone, and walked out from the right side door of the rostrum.</p>
<p>The eleven members of the presidium of the congress have different styles. Yu Youren has a burly physique, is energetic, and has a flowing silver beard. He sits upright in the leather-backed chair in the center of the rostrum. Surrounded by the colorful decoration, he becomes an incomparably magnificent picture. Yu speaks in a low Shaanxi accent, which sounds particularly solemn through the loudspeaker. On the afternoon of the 7th, Yu presided over the most heated "Political Consultative Conference Review Meeting," and his command was well-defined and always orderly.</p>
<p>President Ju often wears a light blue cloth gown, which has been washed for a long time and seems to be a little white. Occasionally, he adds a black waistcoat or mandarin jacket, and a pair of white-soled round-toed cloth shoes, which are spotless. He is full of lightness and expresses an infinitely elegant demeanor. He presides over the congress slowly, calmly, and with clear pronunciation.</p>
<p>President Dai's clothing is more elegant and luxurious than President Ju's. He often wears a gray rat skin robe with a large dark blue flower pattern, covered with a satin mandarin jacket. The badge of the Central Committee member is worn on the right lapel. The mottled short mustache expresses hidden determination and strength. When speaking, the layers are clear, and he speaks in a purely slow Sichuan accent, with clear words. He often goes to the rostrum himself to hand in the slips requesting to speak. On the morning of the 11th, he had a long conversation in a low voice with Feng Yuxiang, who was sitting in the back row, during the border issue report.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Guofu is an old fighter of the party, and he is also a person who can overcome illness with superhuman vitality. During the meeting, he rarely missed or arrived late. He wears a long robe and mandarin jacket, but with a black woolen collar. The loudspeaker on the rostrum is very loud, but during the entire three hours of the meeting, the following never heard Mr. Guo cough.</p>
<p>Those who have attended the Political Consultative Conference will know President Sun's ability to preside over the meeting. He has always been calm and unhurried. He has a habit of always pushing the nearsighted glasses on the bridge of his nose to his forehead when reading documents.</p>
<p>Minister Chen Cheng's energetic and powerful spirit can be seen in his piercing eyes. He sits in the chairman's seat and presides over the congress, always with a smile on his face. However, Minister Chen was unlucky. The seventh meeting he presided over was the post-war relief report and review, which was right after the foreign affairs review. The storm had just passed, and the atmosphere in the venue was relaxed but a little tired. Reviewing post-war relief was like talking about family affairs, and he also encountered a lengthy speech by member Liu Chengcan, whose talks often made people laugh, so that he could not help but urge again and again: "Keep it brief."</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief He's majesty also constitutes an incomparably brilliant picture on the rostrum. His face is ruddy and full, and a row of colorful medals on the left chest reflects each other with the gold collar badges of the general, shining brightly. He speaks in a purely Guizhou dialect, which is as slow and clear as Sichuan dialect.</p>
<p>Mr. Zou Lu's clothing and actions are very casual, and his voice is relatively sharp and fast. His report of: "Comrade XXX of No. XX is speaking" often makes it difficult for people to hear clearly, so that it is impossible to index according to the map. However, when the speaker asks him to "extend it for one more minute," he always often generously agrees.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Lifu has not yet presided over the congress, but he is often the external representative of the presidium. The petition representatives of various provinces in North China are received by him and Vice President Bai on behalf of the presidium, and the petition delegation of Anhui students in Chongqing is also received by him and Mr. Zhang Daofan on behalf of the presidium. He has not yet spoken at the congress.</p>
<p>General Bai Chongxi is one of the members of the presidium who speaks more at the congress. His talks are powerful and decisive, and often win great applause.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Daofan is the most hardworking member of the presidium. He has become the spokesperson of the presidium, and many documents are reported by him to the congress. He speaks in a purely Mandarin Chinese, often adding "Next, please pay special attention" before each paragraph! "Here is an even more important motion!" During the break, he is often seen holding a long cigarette holder with a burning cigarette in his mouth, chatting with people around him, his words are relaxed and his laughter is loud. When the meeting is in session, he is often seen wearing yellow chemical glasses frames, quietly reading the report.</p>
<h3>Developing Transportation in the Northwest; Supporting Private Shipping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] The 17th meeting of the Second Plenary Session passed a resolution on transportation issues, the main points of which are as follows: It is noted that transportation issues, including transportation and communication, were extremely important during the War of Resistance against Japan because they were related to the gains and losses of military affairs. Now that the enemy has surrendered, the completion of demobilization work also relies on transportation as the main item. How to lay the foundation for national construction and strengthen national defense is also the top priority of transportation. In the future, the established policies should be followed, the strength should be strengthened, and efforts should be made to achieve the goal. Now, a comprehensive review of the various points is presented as follows: (1) Transportation employees have worked hard and are worthy of commendation. (2) The allocation of manpower, materials, and financial resources by the Ministry of Transportation is limited by the facts, and it is difficult to achieve the appropriate progress. In addition, the CCP troops obstruct and destroy everywhere, but the transportation employees can still persevere. It is hoped that when the situation permits, work will be carried out quickly in order to meet the needs. (3) The railway and highway construction projects that were rushed during the war and repaired after the war are beneficial to demobilization transportation, but they are still insufficient for actual needs. (4) The reform of the transportation system is still hoped to continue to be studied. (5) The water, land, and air demobilization transportation plan is limited by tools and has failed to meet the needs. The government should hand over the various transportation tools that have been received to the Ministry of Transportation for management and utilization as much as possible, and instruct it to plan and manage them in a unified manner. The management organization must strive to be centralized and simplified, and at the same time, pay attention to eliminating all malpractices and severely cracking down on black market tickets. The transportation of righteous people and refugees returning to their hometowns should not be delayed. (6) Northwest transportation is related to the national plan. Whether it is railway, highway, aviation, or postal and telecommunications, it should be actively developed and listed as the most important work, and planned for implementation. Now, at the time of army reorganization, there will be many surplus officers and soldiers, who should be properly settled. The method of using military engineering for road construction is very appropriate and can be discussed in detail with the relevant agencies and actively promoted in the Northwest. (7) Private shipping is helpful for demobilization transportation and should be quickly supported to promote its active development. (8) Railway materials should be manufactured using self-made rails and accessories. Highway vehicles should also be manufactured by setting up factories. Transportation technical employees must be actively trained and cultivated in large quantities, and their salaries and benefits must be reasonably adjusted. (9) The telecommunications business should be improved to achieve speed and accuracy. The scope and limits of the central and local governments and other institutions that handle communication business should be clearly defined in order to be practical. The military telegraph lines that have been temporarily set up in various places should be properly adjusted.</p>

<p>[United Press, Long Beach, California, 14th] President Truman's special envoy to China, Marshall, returned to the country to report on his duties. He arrived here by plane today and transferred to Washington. It is said that after meeting with President Truman, he will return to China, which may not take more than a few days.

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to ask Secretary of State Byrnes to report on the current international situation and to ask Marshal Marshall to report on Sino-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Yan'an, 14th] The CCP generally believes that President Truman's special envoy to China, Marshall, has "completely succeeded" in his mission in China. According to Communist Army Commander Zhu De, Marshall should still return to China. China still faces many difficulties in the future and needs his support.</p>
<h3>Soviet Trains from North and South Pass Through Harbin to the East; Soviet Troops Near Harbin Have a Look of Mold-Breaking</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Harbin, 14th] After the news of the Soviet troops withdrawing from Fanyang reached here, the people were excited and hoped that the national army could advance as soon as possible. Yang Zuoren, a member of the military representative delegation, arrived in Harbin today, perhaps to negotiate with the Soviet army. The personnel of the Heilongjiang and Hejiang provincial governments are scheduled to leave Harbin on the 19th and return to Changchun, which will not affect the overall takeover of the Northeast. The Harbin municipal government is facing extreme financial difficulties, but various tasks are still being actively promoted.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 14th] At noon on the 14th, thirteen Soviet military trains from the north and south arrived in Harbin. Except for a small number of them getting off at Harbin Station, the rest went east. Soviet troops in various places near Harbin are also concentrating in Harbin, preparing to move. Currently, every day there are long snake trains full of goods heading towards Suifenhe and Zhalantun.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] According to the government's telegram received today, seven trains carrying the withdrawing Soviet troops from Shenyang have passed through Changchun, and they should be heading to Siberia. The remaining Fanyang garrison troops stationed in Changchun will also depart soon. Underground elements active in the suburbs of Shenyang were previously suspected of cooperating with the CCP, but now they have joined the national army. At the same time, it is reported that tens of thousands of Communist troops are moving from Faku, more than 130 miles north of Shenyang, towards Fushun.

<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th dispatch] This morning at 10:50 AM, this reporter inquired about the situation in Shenyang via a long-distance call to Director Peng Bisheng in Shenyang. According to him, the city is in excellent order, but all water and electricity have been cut off since last night. This is likely due to the destruction of the power plant at Fangzizui in Dongdaying, which was occupied by the Communist forces. Currently, there is also a large-scale power plant in Hunhepu, on the south bank of the Hun River, which was recently occupied by the Communist forces. National troops have been dispatched this morning to take over. It is unknown whether there will be a conflict. The Shenyang Garrison Headquarters will be established on the morning of the 16th, with Zhao Gongwu as commander and Peng Bisheng as deputy commander. After the headquarters is established, the forward command post will be closed. Peng also said that the Shenyang airfield is currently defended by the National troops and there may be an aircraft landing at the airfield for the first time today.

<h3>Northern Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Reopened to Hanzhuang</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 14th dispatch] The repair work on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is progressing smoothly, and it has now been reopened to Hanzhuang.

<h3>Remnants of the Japanese Kwantung Army Lurking in Various Parts of the Northeast</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 15th dispatch] According to someone who participated in the work of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association in Harbin in the early days of the Northeast's recovery: Li Zhaolin, the head of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association in Harbin, and Yu Shuzhong, the head of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association in Sipingjie, were assassinated and killed successively. These two shocking bloody cases seem to be subtly related to the Japanese terrorist organization called the "Violent Killing Group," which was recently uncovered under the control of the Soviet army in the Northeast. Insidious elements of the Japanese Kwantung Army lurking in various parts of the Northeast have been carrying out their pro-Soviet espionage against China and promoting the Communists while suppressing the Nationalists under the various complex situations created by the Northeast issue in the past. The so-called "unpredictability" means that they only seek benefits for the restoration of Japan, and it does not hurt to be friendly today and kill tomorrow, so as to confuse any powerful figures on the land of the Northeast. It is heard that they have provided convenience for the survival of these people, such as the Soviet army and the Chinese Communists, without exception. They are deeply convinced of the strength of these people, and they have been working together in Siberia with hundreds of thousands of Japanese prisoners of war. Sensitive and capable Soviet intelligence agents are also helpless. It is not that they do not know, but because they underestimate the situation and are eager to use them, which has caused this to happen. Currently, nine principal culprits of this type of violent killing group have been arrested, and fifteen suspects have been identified, but it is not difficult to catch them all in one fell swoop. It only requires mutual trust between China and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union to fulfill its promises, withdraw from the Northeast, and remove the clouds of suspicion. These people will then find it difficult to carry out their deceitful tricks in broad daylight.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Harbin, 14th dispatch] There are clues to the Li Zhaolin case and it can be solved within days.</p>
<h3>Increasing Revenue for Counties and Cities; Increased Allocation of Taxes</h3>

<p>Also, a train of Soviet troops arrives at the Karaj station, 23 miles northwest of the Iranian capital, every other night, carrying tanks, artillery, etc. At the same time, motorized trucks also arrive there with a large number of Soviet infantry.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th dispatch] According to a TASS dispatch broadcast by Moscow Radio tonight: "The reports from the United States about Soviet troops moving in Iran have no factual basis. The US State Department said that Soviet troops are moving south through Tabriz towards Tehran and the western border of Iran. This news agency is authorized to issue a statement that this is absolutely untrue."</p>
<p>[United Press, Istanbul, 14th dispatch] Turkey is still fully mobilized. Today, it was heard that Soviet combat troops are moving south in Iran and going straight down along the Turkish-Iraqi border. Upon hearing the news, everyone was stunned and remained silent. There was no direct reaction from the government officials, but the government authorities said that Turkey would not tolerate aggression and is willing to fight. The purpose of the Soviet troop movement has not yet been determined, but diplomatic circles claim that this may be a strategy to exert pressure on Turkey, intending to obtain the provinces of Kars and Ardahan, which the Soviet Union demanded in June last year. The Turkish army is currently maintaining wartime strength, with approximately one million soldiers. According to a dispatch from Ankara, the news of the Soviet troop movement was received there with more composure than in Istanbul, but with close attention. This time, the Soviet Union's deployment of troops on the southeastern border of Turkey is actually equivalent to military encirclement, because the northeastern border of Turkey faces Georgia, the east has Armenia and Iran, and the north is bounded by the Black Sea. Only the southern border with Iraq has no Soviet troops.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 15th dispatch] The information about Soviet military actions received by London officials is not all-encompassing, but there are three points that can be confirmed: (1) Soviet troops have indeed been reinforced in Iran since March 2, crossing the border and entering northern Iran. (2) These troops include armored units. (3) Soviet troops have withdrawn from the cities of Shahmna, Sharud, and Meshed in northeastern Iran.</p>
<h3>Truman's Remarks to Reporters: Current International Situation Not Surprising; Denies Disagreements with Secretary of State; Hopes to Attend the Security Council Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th dispatch] President Truman stated at his weekly press conference yesterday that the current international situation did not surprise him. He avoided answering questions about US-Soviet relations, only saying: "I do not believe the situation is as dangerous as some people imagine." The President said there are no plans to hold a Big Three meeting, and he has not recently had any contact with Stalin on international issues. The President stated that he could not provide more information about the movement of the Red Army in Iran, and also declined to comment on Stalin's criticism of Churchill. A reporter also asked the President to comment on the statement made by the former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman, that "the Soviet Union is only bluffing," which was also rejected. Before holding the press conference yesterday, the President met with Harriman for about half an hour. President Truman said that the United Nations Security Council will hold its next meeting in New York on March 25 as scheduled, and he hopes to attend the first meeting, but the final decision will depend on developments in Washington. The President reiterated that he believes that military leaders should first be consulted on the control of atomic energy, but the main control power should be given to civilian officials directly responsible to the President.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th dispatch] President Truman said at a press conference that rumors of disagreements between him and Secretary of State Byrnes are unfounded.</p>
<p>[Also] The United Nations Security Council has scheduled a meeting in New York on March 25. If Iran does not raise the case of its complaint against the Soviet Union at the London meeting, the US government will ask the Council to discuss it again.</p>
<h3>Soviet Five-Year Plan to Develop Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 14th, Associated Press] Academician Vavilov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, wrote in Izvestia recently that the Soviet Union has formulated a five-year plan to develop atomic energy.</p>
<h3>US Congressman Demands Removal of Pro-Soviet Officials</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th dispatch] Congressman May, chairman of the House Military Subcommittee, announced today that the committee has requested the State Department to dismiss all officials in the department's intelligence division who have "strong pro-Soviet tendencies." Other committee members also said that they had submitted a "strong message" to Secretary of State Byrnes.</p>
<h3>"Security" - A Beautiful Name!</h3>
<p>The territory annexed by the Soviet Union under this pretext has reached more than 270,000 square miles</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 15th dispatch] The New York Times acknowledges the Soviet Union's right to demand security, but at the same time points out that the Soviet Union has annexed more than 270,000 square miles of land and more than 24 million people in this war under the name of security. We have reason to ask where the Soviet Union's pursuit of security will stop? Where does its expansion begin?</p>
<h3>Iranian Prime Minister Issues First Order</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 14th dispatch] Iranian Prime Minister Sadr, issued his first order today since taking office last month, banning public political gatherings and demonstrations. It is said that the motivation for this move is due to the people's abuse of political freedom. (Note: According to a Reuters dispatch from London, the Iranian Prime Minister has restored the people's freedom of political assembly)</p>
<h3>Churchill to Speak Again Today</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 14th dispatch] Churchill, who recently advocated a British-American military alliance and aroused strong resentment in Moscow, will deliver a speech at the New York welcome reception on Friday evening (Shanghai time Saturday morning, 11:30 AM).</p>
<h3>Amidst Reports of Soviet Troops Moving Towards the Turkish Border, British and American Fleets to Visit Turkey; Battleships and Aircraft Carriers to Accompany</h3>
<p>[United Press, Atlantic City, New Jersey, 15th dispatch] Authoritative British sources announced today that a powerful unit of the British Mediterranean Fleet is preparing to join the US battleship Missouri in visiting Turkey to return the remains of Turkish Ambassador to the United States Ertegun. Ertegun passed away in Washington in 1944. The source of this news did not want to be named, but it is sufficient to show that the United Kingdom and the United States are clearly determined to maintain their friendship with Turkey. According to the State Department, the Missouri will only lead the destroyer Power to the Mediterranean as an escort. The British side said that a number of units of the British Mediterranean Fleet will join the Missouri and Power, and may also include several aircraft carriers. One of Britain's largest battleships may also join the trip. The US State Department insisted that the dispatch of the largest warship to the Mediterranean at this time has no military relationship. This mission has a precedent to follow, but in view of the report of Soviet troops moving towards the Turkish border in Iran, this news is inevitably of diplomatic significance.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Roosevelt's Insightful Words</h3>
<p>The English-speaking nations cannot survive alone without non-English-speaking people.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th dispatch] The Joint Committee of Women Members of the Senate and House of Representatives hosted a banquet today for the late President Roosevelt's wife, with more than a thousand people attending. Mrs. Roosevelt said in her speech that Churchill led Britain in the war and made great contributions, but "We should recognize that although the English-speaking people are strong, they cannot survive without a larger number of non-English-speaking people."</p>
<h3>Retrospect of Soviet-Turkish Relations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th dispatch] The frequent movement of Soviet troops in Iran has caused the world to pay close attention to the Soviet Union's demands on Turkey again. The provinces of Kars and Ardahan on the Caucasian border were ceded to Turkey according to the 1921 treaty. The Soviet Union demanded that Turkey return the two provinces, and also demanded a base in the Dardanelles Strait. However, according to Turkish spokespersons, Turkey will reject this demand and will not hesitate to fight. The Soviet Union and Turkey have historically been incompatible, and the previous territorial disputes are only the obvious ones. The Soviet Union notified the termination of the 1925 Soviet-Turkish Friendship Treaty in March last year, and Soviet newspapers accused Turkey of having too close relations with Germany. Since the 18th century, the Soviet Union and Turkey have never maintained a long-term genuine friendly relationship. The two countries had several conflicts over territorial issues in 1736, 1768, 1792, 1812, and 1853. In 1877, the Soviet Union and Turkey went to war again, resulting in the Kars Plateau being incorporated into the Soviet Union. In the 9th and 10th centuries, Armenians established a government in Kars, and disputes have continued ever since. During the First World War, although Turkey was a defeated country, the two provinces of Kars and Ardahan finally belonged to Turkey by means of a referendum in 1912, and Turkey also recognized the Soviet government for this reason.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Churchill's Speech</h3>
<p>Churchill, the former Prime Minister of the British wartime government, recently delivered two speeches in the United States, one at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, on March 5, and the other at the Virginia State Legislature on March 8. Although the wording of the two speeches is different, the main points are to raise the vigilance of British and American people and advocate that English-speaking nations should strengthen their unity to cope with the changing world. In the speech at Westminster College in Fulton, Churchill frankly said: "Unless the English-speaking people are united as brothers, it will still be difficult to prevent war or promote the organization of world institutions. The United Kingdom and the United States must not only maintain a spirit of friendship and mutual understanding, but also need military advisers from both countries to maintain close relations to study potential crises, and then they can cultivate fraternal unity. It is also necessary to jointly use the naval and air force bases owned by the two countries around the world to ensure mutual security. The Dark Ages may return, and good times do not last long. The victory of the Allies has now been overshadowed, and we should be vigilant." He also said: "I greatly admire the courage and resilience of the Russian people and Comrade Stalin. The United Kingdom still sympathizes with and treats the entire Russian nation with goodwill, and will always maintain permanent friendship with it. The ancient countries of Central and Eastern Europe are now all within the Soviet sphere of influence. However, the concept of honor will be decided under the supervision of the British, American, and French inspectors in future elections. The Communist parties in Eastern European countries are originally in the minority. It is feared that it will be difficult for them to be competent for the responsibilities they bear now that they are emerging, and they even want to strive for totalitarian rule. Except for Czechoslovakia, there is no real democratic politics in the rest of the countries. The oppression exerted by the Soviet Union on Turkey and the situation of the Russian Communist Party in Germany are not what we want to see in the construction after the liberation of Europe, nor are they elements sufficient to constitute lasting peace."</p>
<p>Since Churchill's speech was published, this newspaper has never made any comments. This is because Churchill, in his capacity as a commoner after leaving office, gave the speech, so it was not necessary to pay attention to it. Moreover, the target audience of Churchill's speech was the American audience, and the need for English-speaking nations to strengthen their unity to cope with the changing world has nothing to do with our involvement. The Soviet Union also remained silent about Churchill's speech until March 13, when the Moscow "Pravda" published an interview between the newspaper's reporter and Marshal Stalin. Stalin criticized Churchill's remarks. According to a United Press dispatch from London on the 13th, Moscow Radio broadcast an interview between Marshal Stalin and a Pravda reporter. Stalin said that Churchill's speech, some of which involved Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Hungary, was a lie. He also said: Churchill's speech was very dangerous. Churchill advocated war against the Soviet Union... He not only has people in the United Kingdom who echo his demands, but also in the United States. But it must be pointed out that Churchill and his friends remind people of Hitler and his friends. Hitler adopted racial theories to establish his war doctrine, declaring that only those who speak Germanic languages are pure races. Churchill also used racial theories to incite war, conferring privileges on the English-speaking nations and giving them the right to determine the fate of the world. … Churchill and his friends in the United Kingdom and the United States are now issuing an ultimatum to non-English-speaking countries: "If you automatically acknowledge our superiority, everything will be fine; otherwise, war is inevitable."</p>
<p>After Marshal Stalin made this statement, Churchill himself refused to comment, but British and American public opinion criticized it. The London Daily Mail said: Marshal Stalin's personal abuse of Churchill is despicable and regrettable, and these are not words that a politician should have. Hearing his words can make one imagine his person. His interpretation of the current international crisis can only explain that the world's tension is caused by the Soviet Union's power politics and aggression against neighboring countries, but it cannot absolve the Soviet Union of its responsibility. The New York Times said: If the Soviet Union believes that the hesitation shown by the US Congress towards Churchill's speech is an opportunity to split the friendly relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States, it is a mistake. The newspaper also said that if the Soviet Union wants to give Churchill an effective answer, what Moscow needs to do is to abide by the guarantees, agreements, and treaties it has made with other countries.</p>
<p>What surprises us is that Churchill's speech, made in his capacity as a commoner, was criticized by the highest authorities in the Soviet Union. We are neither the so-called English-speaking nation, nor is the Soviet Union our great ally, so we do not want to comment on Churchill's speech and Stalin's reply. However, precisely because we are not the so-called English-speaking nation, if we want to use Hitler's racial theory to counterattack, it is not difficult to discover the direction of sympathy in the minds of the Chinese people. Hitler and his friends were defeated, but where exactly does Hitlerism now appear in the world?</p>
<h3>England Sends Another Note to the Soviet Union Questioning Intentions in Iran; Bevin Says Current Soviet Policy Inexplicable</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th] A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office stated today that Britain has sent a note to the Soviet Union questioning its intentions in Iran. Until a reply is received, it cannot be determined whether the Soviet Union's Middle East policy is aggressive or defensive in nature. News from Canberra indicates that Australian Foreign Minister Evatt stated in the Australian Parliament that Australia believes Soviet policy aims at defense, a view shared by Britain.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] Foreign Secretary Bevin reported to the House of Commons today on the urgent situation in Iran, stating that any settlement between Iran and the Soviet Union while Soviet troops remain in Iran would clearly be obtained under duress, which Britain would view with regret. Soviet troops are currently still stationed in Iran, but whether Britain will redeploy troops to the troubled areas of Iran has not yet been decided. The British government has also not taken any steps to negotiate with the Iranian government regarding the return of British troops to Iran. The current policy of the Soviet government is particularly inexplicable to the British government, and the fact that all the guarantees it has provided have not been fulfilled is especially unbelievable.</p>
<h3>Shanghai to New York: Reachable in 28 and a Half Hours</h3>

The Congress Party may appoint the party chairman Acharya, Gandhi's right-hand man Patel, and former chairman Nehru to form a committee to negotiate with the British delegation. During the negotiations, the Congress Party Executive Committee will continue to hold meetings in Delhi, and Gandhi will also remain in Delhi.</p>

Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir today lodged a strong protest with Allied Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch East Indies, Lieutenant General Stockwell, stating that the Dutch action was intended to indicate that they had regained control of the Dutch East Indies, while concealing "the fact that its sovereignty is still subject to rigorous testing."

<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Three Major Traitors to be Publicly Prosecuted</p>
<p>The three major traitors Chen Gongbo, Chu Minyi, and Chen Bijun were transferred from Nanjing to Suzhou on the 17th of last month and detained in the detention center. Chief Prosecutor Han of the Suzhou High Court Prosecutor's Office, in order to handle this case with caution, specially dispatched Prosecutor Wei and Secretary Gu to Nanjing and Shanghai to collect evidence. They have now returned to Suzhou with the evidence. On the afternoon of the 10th, Prosecutor Li, under the order of Chief Prosecutor Han, interrogated Chen Gongbo for about an hour, and Chen admitted that he was an undeniable culprit who harmed the country. On the afternoon of the 13th, Chief Prosecutor Han ordered Prosecutors Wei and Wang to summon Chen Bijun and Chu Minyi to court. The interrogation lasted for about an hour before it was completed. During the investigation, the High Court conducted the interrogation of this case very secretly. Because the evidence of the three traitors' crimes is undeniable, after one or two more interrogations, a public prosecution can be filed with the Criminal Division of the same court.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Leader of Water and Fire Gang Apprehended</p>
<p>Major robbery cases have occurred in various places in the county last year. Among the robbers, there are young robbers aged fourteen or fifteen, who are extremely vicious and severely beat the victims. The county newspapers have reported on these incidents. Recently, eight families, including Beimenwai, Beitangzhen, Duihe Huishanzhen, Ding Lane, and Yichang Oil Factory, were robbed in major cases. There were also young robbers involved, who hung and beat the victims, and used various cruel methods such as pouring cold water and burning their buttocks. The case is serious and sensational in the county.

<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>Former County Magistrate Publicly Prosecuted</p>
<p>Former Magistrate He Peixuan, after being transferred to the Suzhou High Court, was investigated by Prosecutor Wang Wenzun. It was determined that the crime he committed should constitute the crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. However, the defendant is 71 years old, and the crime was committed before June 1, 1944, so the sentence should be reduced according to law. During his time in the puppet government, he assisted in the anti-Japanese war and engaged in behaviors that benefited the people, so he may be given a lighter sentence. According to Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed.</p>

<h3>Military Strength of Middle Eastern Countries; Turkey and Iraq Have the Best Quality; British Troops Number Over 500,000</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Although the official strength of British troops in the Middle East has not been fully announced, it is not difficult to estimate at present. The main concentrations of British troops in the Middle East are in Egypt, Palestine, and Iraq. Palestine is the center of operations for British troops in the Middle East. In addition to five army divisions, including one Indian division, three infantry divisions, and one paratrooper division, there are also approximately 100,000 personnel from the Royal Air Force and engineering corps. Although these are motorized armored units, there are no tanks stationed in Palestine. The barracks are already full, so it is impossible to increase troops. The British troops in Iraq are mainly air force, supplemented by some supply and guard units, and the number is far less than those in Palestine. Among the armies of the Middle Eastern countries, the armies of Turkey, Iraq, and Transjordan have the best quality. The Turkish army has approximately 500,000 troops, Iraq has approximately 16,000 mechanized troops trained and paid by the British. These troops are for self-defense and have never participated in modern warfare. The Syrian army has approximately 10,000 troops, and Lebanon has approximately 5,000 troops, both of which are domestic defense forces. The official number of Egyptian army personnel has not been announced, but it is estimated to be approximately 60,000. Prime Minister Attlee announced that the total number of British armed forces at home and abroad is 2 million, of which 1.2 million are army, and the navy and air force each account for 400,000. Subtracting the number of British occupation troops in Germany and Austria and the number of British troops in the Far East and India, the total number of British troops in the Middle East should be lower than the generally estimated number of 500,000 to 1 million. The Iranian army has approximately 90,000 troops, of which 45,000 have been trained, and the rest are recruits. Their equipment is outdated and unbearable, and there are deep political and social prejudices between officers and soldiers, only maintaining internal security.</p>

<h3>Housing Cooperative's First Step Plan: Building 2,000 Houses</h3>
<p>The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Housing Cooperative held a standing committee meeting at the office of the special commissioner for cooperative affairs of the Ministry of Social Affairs on Daming Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from 15 agencies including the municipal government attended. Special Commissioner Chen Zhongming presided over the meeting. The draft articles of association were approved, and the name of the cooperative was changed to Shanghai First Housing Cooperative. The purpose of the cooperative is to build or rent houses collectively in the spirit of mutual assistance for the residence of its members. It will also provide various educational, health, transportation, and entertainment facilities to cultivate the collective life of its members. To solve the housing problem, three measures were decided: collectively building residential houses, with most of the construction costs being loaned from banks; ordering mobile homes from the United States, with the cooperative raising most of the refined flour; and negotiating with the Soviet-Jiangsu-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau to allocate enemy and puppet houses for the use of the cooperative. Representatives from relevant agencies have been appointed to carry out the above three measures separately. Wang Yuankang, a representative of the Public Works Bureau, was appointed to be responsible for construction design, Zhang Shengwu, a representative of the Land Administration Bureau, was appointed to be responsible for geological survey, and Chen Zhongming, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Shen Shanhong, a representative of the Enemy Property Administration Bureau, were appointed to be responsible for negotiating with the Enemy Property Administration Bureau to allocate enemy and puppet houses. The cooperative's initial plan is to build 1,000 detached houses and 1,000 apartment-style houses in Pudong, Caohejing, Jiangwan, and other places.</p>

<h3>Shen Xiaoxiang, a Robber Wounded and Arrested, Executed</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command executed a robber named Shen Xiaoxiang at Song Park in Jiangwan at 3:00 PM yesterday and also announced the criminal's crimes. The statement reads: It was found that Shen Xiaoxiang was surrendered to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for robbery and obstructing official duties. It has been determined through interrogation that the criminal, together with Wang Laisheng and others, broke into the home of Japanese national Furuya Toshihide at 214 Kunshan Road on September 29, 1945, and robbed jewelry and valuables worth approximately 200 million yuan in puppet currency, as well as four gold bars, one diamond ring, 20,000 yuan in legal currency, and 1 million yuan in puppet currency carried by guests Jing Juyuan and Xu Yuying.

<h3>The Siam Delegation's Visit to China: Promoting Further Cooperation Between the Two Countries... A Visit to Delegation Head Yun Tianfu at the Cathay Hotel</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter, Mai Tian</p>
<p>"Although our purpose in coming to Shanghai is sightseeing, our purpose in coming to China is to promote diplomatic relations between China and Siam. Not only between the two countries but also to enable the people of China and Siam to further understand each other." Siam delegation leader Yun Tianfu said yesterday afternoon when he received our newspaper reporter at the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<p>Yun Tianfu is forty-four years old this year, but he looks no more than thirty. He is short in stature, very amiable, and speaks fluent English. He has been the Secretary of State of the Siamese government since 1939. His father was Chinese, but he grew up in Bangkok and is visiting China for the first time. Speaking of the conflicts between overseas Chinese and Siamese people, Yun said: "I can guarantee that this matter has absolutely no political background," nor does it have any anti-China tendency. For hundreds of years, China and Siam have intermarried, and Siam is like one family. Many Siamese people have Chinese ancestry, including myself. For hundreds of years, there has never been any discord between China and Siam, so the Siamese people will never be anti-China. This incident occurred last September, and the reasons were all due to minor matters, such as small conflicts in customs and habits between the two countries. However, such conflicts have recently subsided. There are currently more than two million Chinese residents in Siam, and tens of thousands in Bangkok. Regarding the issue of trade between China and Siam, according to Yun, the transportation problem is that Siam has no ships to transport goods for export. If China can facilitate transportation, mutual trade can begin. Currently, what Siam lacks most are textile raw materials and building materials. At present, Siamese rice exports are shipped by the UK under the Anglo-Siamese agreement and then distributed to other countries after consultation with Washington. Siam's own industry and commerce are not developed, and very few goods were imported during the war. The educational level of the people in Siam is quite high, with more than half having received considerable education. There are currently two universities and many other specialized schools and middle schools in Bangkok. There is also a "Women's Newspaper" in Bangkok, where all the staff except the printing workers are women. In terms of clothing, men and women mostly adopt European styles. The King of Siam is only twenty years old, unmarried, and has not yet been crowned. He previously studied politics at a university in Switzerland. Because he has not yet graduated, he will soon return to Switzerland to continue his studies. The Siamese political system is roughly based on the British system, but the king must be a Buddhist. Most of the people in power in Siam are Buddhists, and Yun and the other six delegation members are also Buddhists. Bangkok also suffered significant losses in the war, with 6,000 houses destroyed by bombing, so there is a great need for reconstruction. There are currently about 13,000 Japanese soldiers, 20,000 Japanese, and the British military authorities are assisting in repatriation.</p>
<p>The delegation departed for China on the 25th of last month and has visited Chongqing and Beiping. They have a good impression of Shanghai, but feel it is too cold, and the constant rain is unpleasant. The climate in Beiping is even colder, so it is no wonder that people accustomed to the tropics cannot stand it. Yun and others plan to go to Nanjing next Wednesday to set up the embassy. The candidate for the new ambassador has not yet been decided and may be transferred from the current ambassador to Switzerland. After going to Nanjing, they plan to go to Chongqing for about a week before heading south through Guangzhou to return home.</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce Hosts a Tea Party, Hoping to Enhance Trade Relations</p>

First, Wang Xiaolai delivered a welcome speech, which was translated into Siamese by Liao Liejin. Then, Delegation Leader Yun delivered a reply speech in English, saying briefly: He expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome from all sectors of our country and said that when he was in Chongqing, the Minister of Food Xu Kan told him: he has consulted with the British Embassy on the transportation of 15,000 tons of rice to China. Since China sent a delegation to Siam, a delegation was specially formed to visit China to reciprocate. He firmly believes that after the two countries sign a Sino-Siamese friendship treaty, they will surely further enhance friendship and strengthen cooperation. He hoped that trade between the two countries can also increase day by day. He immediately presented a letter from the chairman of the Siam Chamber of Commerce, Lansen, to the City Chamber of Commerce, which mainly stated that he hoped that the chambers of commerce of the two countries can cooperate with each other to promote trade relations between China and Siam, and hoped to provide the delegation with the convenience of studying China's trade, transportation, finance, commerce and other conditions, and to cultivate and dredge trade routes. Also, at 8:15 last night, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs invited them to watch a movie at the Majestic Theatre. Mayor Qian has scheduled a banquet for all members of the delegation at his private residence at noon today.</p>

<h3>Secretary-General of the Chamber of Commerce Talks About the New Company Law</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] For the rumor that the new Company Law will be implemented on April 1st this year, the reporter specially visited Mr. Yan Jiusheng, Secretary-General of the City Chamber of Commerce. According to reports, the saying that it will be implemented on April 1st was spread at a symposium held by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce last week, and its accuracy remains to be confirmed. However, whether the new Company Law is revised or not depends on how the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce is signed.

However, from the standpoint of pure scholars and legislators, it seems better to retain it.

<h3>Labor Strikes and Prices: Cause and Effect - Salary Adjustments Barely Made Before Living Becomes a Problem Again - Social Bureau Labor Office Director Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Jianhua, Director of the Labor Office of the Social Bureau, gave a statement to our newspaper reporter yesterday regarding the issue of labor strikes, saying: "Labor strikes occur due to high prices, but high prices are also caused by labor strikes."</p>
<p>"Because employers in various industries increase expenses due to salary adjustments for employees, they will inevitably raise the prices of goods to compensate. If one industry does this, all industries will do the same. As a result, employees' adjusted salaries are not enough to maintain their livelihoods, leading to further labor strikes. Therefore, labor strikes and prices have become inextricably linked, and labor strikes continue in a cycle."</p>
<p>"Endless Cycle"</p>
<p>"This situation is most obvious and very serious. The authorities are paying close attention to this and are determined to work hard to stabilize the financial situation and suppress prices in order to fundamentally resolve labor strikes. However, the wartime financial chaos is extreme, and it will take a considerable period of time to return to normal. During this difficult period, we hope that both labor and management will be patient for the time being, and it will not be difficult to get through it. The government has already taken various measures, such as opening up foreign exchange, so that overseas materials can flow in continuously; restoring transportation to make it smooth; and resuming factory work to increase production, etc., in order to stabilize the financial situation. If supplies return to normal, labor strikes can naturally be eliminated." Director Li anticipates that factory strikes in this city will subside after May of this year, but temporarily, it may still continue for some time.</p>

<p>Taikoo Wharf Workers Strike</p>
<p>More than a thousand workers at Taikoo Wharf went on strike collectively at 10:00 AM yesterday, making it impossible to unload the Taikoo ships that arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The reason for the strike is said to be that the workers have suffered extreme hardship due to the pressure of living expenses since 1939. Three days ago, the Taikoo head manager was reported to have arrived in Shanghai from England, so they jointly requested the head manager to provide subsidies for the losses of the past few years. The company authorities did not grant the request, which led to the strike.</p>

As it has not been resolved, all employees began a slowdown strike from the day before yesterday. However, the older Minnan people can still sell eggs themselves and are not affected.

<h3>Gold Price Stabilizes Around 1,600,000 - U.S. Dollars Also Stable</h3>
<p>The Shanghai gold market initially showed weakness yesterday but then stabilized. The Central Bank allocated 153 bars, with the price remaining at 1,600,000. At this time, peers found the allocated price difficult to accept, but the Central Bank was unwilling to sell at a lower price. The morning struggled below 600,000 throughout. Sales improved near noon, with securities firms and general idle funds also absorbing. When the black market recovered, the authorities were unwilling to respond to the market at the 1,600,000 price. The afternoon turned stable, with limited transactions, and the overall trend remained sideways. It was observed that it opened at 1,560,000 with buyers, the situation was stable, and gradually improved. General predictions were lower than the previous day's market price, and the Central Bank was unwilling to supply, so around 10:00, it was approaching 1,600,000. When the Central Bank's allocation registration of 153 bars, priced at 1,600,000, was officially decided, it initially seemed difficult for the industry to accept, but buyers quickly became active. At noon, it had exceeded the 1,600,000 mark. The afternoon continued to stabilize, and the final price reached a high of 1,640,000, resulting in a recovery of about 60,000 compared to the previous close.

<h3>Stock Market Emerges as a Dark Horse - Idle Funds Favor Sino Land - Small-Cap Stocks Close at Their Peaks</h3>
<p>Government bonds continued to trade sideways yesterday, but the hot A-bonds were being taken off the market.  They failed to strengthen along with gold and stock prices. A-bonds initially opened struggling around 1,750 yuan. After reaching 1,780 yuan, they were contained by profit-taking from the bulls, retreating to around 1,580 yuan before recovering slightly and hovering around 1,650 yuan. The noon close was 100 yuan lower for both A and E bonds compared to the previous close. Miscellaneous bonds did not fall much. Shanghai stocks were thinking of risk at high levels, so large-cap stocks traded sideways after reaching highs, while small-cap stocks made vigorous progress. Jingfu and Xinguang advanced without retreating, and Qinheng's background was inferior. Although it was pulled up, there were many retracements. Yarn factories opened in the morning at 4,000 yuan, Meiya at 3,100 yuan, and Jingfu at 220 yuan. After opening, they were slightly lower, with yarn factories reaching 3,950 yuan, Meiya 3,000 yuan, and Jingfu 215 yuan, before starting to rebound.

<h3>Central Bank Prepares to Restore Tianjin and Beijing Exchange Markets</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Bank recently plans to open foreign exchange markets in both Tianjin and Beijing. Preparations are now actively underway. Once the personnel deployment is completed and contact is established with the local customs offices, it can begin to restore operations. The exchange rates for the British pound and other countries have not yet been announced. It is reported that the person in charge of the Central Bank had already instructed the heads of British banks to devise methods at the beginning of the opening of the foreign exchange market so that there would be a framework to follow for the settlement of trade between China and Britain after the exchange rates were announced. However, due to various issues, everything is still under discussion.</p>
<p>Another report: Since the Foreign Exchange Examination Office of the Central Bank began accepting applications for types A and B foreign exchange businesses, two weeks have passed quickly. To date, there are more than 130 applications for type A businesses and only two for type B. It is reported that the deadline for applications will be the 19th of this month.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Stable, Speculators Gradually Become Bored</h3>
<p>The yarn market was still relatively stable yesterday. Although sales to customers were not very smooth, sporadic transactions were still coming in steadily. Twenty-count medium-grade brands such as Da Feiting (Big Airship) and Shenhu (Magic Tiger) yarn were being inquired about. Sixteen-count yarn was not as popular as before, because cotton mills were taking a wait-and-see attitude. The Fang Jian company opened sales yesterday for thirteen kinds of printed cotton cloth and also added twelve kinds of American cloth. It is reported that hemp, wool, and woolen products will be sold as usual today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton prices fell by 8 to 20 points. The near-term price was US$26.95, the far-term price was 26.42, and the spot price for midlings was 27.23. Bombay Indian cotton prices fell by 23 Robbies. The price for Pingger was 46.5, for Amuera 47.75, for white cotton the near-term price was 48.25, and the far-term price was 48.6. The local cotton market continued to follow American and Indian cotton and was flat and weak. However, transactions were still strong due to the urgent need for fine-grade raw materials by Fang Jian company and Shenxin and other factories. In total, there were as many as 2,300 to 400 bales. Purchase prices were similar except for ginned cotton, which fell by 1,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Firm</h3>
<p>Prices of foreign rice from the Relief Administration may hopefully fall slightly</p>
<p>The rice market was weak in the morning and stabilized in the afternoon, with results similar to yesterday. The Taiwanese flour market had declined, and the market stabilized. Oil prices showed a slight upward trend, rising by 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Dou Bing was agitated but not strong. The price each rose by 100 yuan or 200 yuan. There were not many transactions of yellow soybeans, and the market was peaceful. Bran was also less affected by ups and downs, and raw peanuts also lacked fluctuations. The corn market was sluggish, and both sesame arrivals and consumption were weak, and the situation was mediocre. Cotton cakes and vegetable cakes still did not see breathing, and grain temporarily tended to trade sideways. If the weather turns sunny, rice prices may fall slightly, but it will not fall too much before the foreign rice of the Relief Administration arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Coal Arrives Steadily</h3>
<p>The source of coal is smooth. The British ship "William J. Thornycroft" brought 9,000 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao. It anchored outside Wusongkou for three days. Due to the lack of docks, the original "Zhongshan" ship was anchored on the 32nd and 33rd buoys and sailed to Qinhuangdao to load coal yesterday. The British ship entered the port and anchored on the buoy to unload coal. It was also reported that the Fuel Management Committee purchased a large amount of white coal in Viet Portampha and began to transport it to Shanghai. The first ship, the "Mary Lyon", brought 9,400 tons of white coal from the port and is expected to arrive tomorrow. Also, the "Halter Maller" will leave Shanghai Harbor on Tuesday to transport coal to that port. The Fuel Committee also leased the Taikoo Company's "Nanchang" ship in Hong Kong, which will sail directly from Hong Kong to that port to transport coal to Shanghai within days. A large number of white coal will soon arrive in Shanghai, and Qinhuangdao and Keelung coal will also arrive steadily. The supply of fuel is gradually becoming sufficient.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Exports Inactive, Domestic and Foreign Prices Not Close</h3>
<p>After the foreign exchange regulations were established, export transactions of white tung oil could have been active, but because they failed to meet American prices, export business was still touch-and-go. In recent years, the production of tung oil areas has sharply decreased due to blocked exports, so arrivals are not strong and prices cannot be too low. According to news from Hangzhou, the price is around 66,000 yuan or 67,000 yuan. Although the wholesale price of various companies in this city is set at 72,000 yuan or 73,000 yuan, sales are not very smooth, and it is feared that the future market will not be good for a while. It is reported that Hongjiang tung oil has arrived in Shanghai from Xifucheng. The wholesale price of each brand is between 60,000 yuan per barrel.</p>
<h3>American Businesses Peddling Large Quantities of Dyes - 4/5 Lower Than Shanghai Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai market for pigments and dyes has seen increased demand due to the successive resumption of work by various dye factories, and many customers are competing to purchase, so prices are gradually increasing. In the midst of this rising price and shortage, it is reported that the American Farak Dye Factory has entrusted a certain metal company in this city to sell a large quantity of dyes in China. Its price is about 4/5 lower than the current Shanghai price. It will open for business this week, and several dye factories have already pre-ordered. The ordering procedure is as follows: after the purchaser determines the products they need to order, they sign a contract with the distributor. The purchaser pays the full amount of the price converted into US dollars at the current official rate to any bank in Shanghai, such as Citibank or HSBC, which will be transferred to New York, and the receiving bank guarantees receipt of payment. It is reported that the goods will be delivered to Shanghai within two months from the date of payment. The purchaser is responsible for the shipping costs and insurance fees from New York to Shanghai, which amount to approximately US$4 per ton.</p>
<h3>Summary of Commercial Conditions</h3>
<p>Longans: Because of quiet sales, the prices of miscellaneous large-grain longans have fallen. 100 to 200 pieces were sold at 68,000 yuan. The market is still preventing them from falling further.</p>
<p>Industrial Raw Materials: The market continues to be weak, people are bearish, arrivals continue, and prices are falling across the board.</p>
<p>Silk: Because new factory silk has not yet been produced, there are only limited old goods traded on the market, and prices remain stable. 150-denier Tianqiao semi-luster artificial silk has buyers, and the price has risen. There is little movement in the rest of the products. Meiya bed sheets opened in the morning and remained at the original price. Later, because the Suzhou retailers had a slight interest, the price rose by 30,000 yuan compared to yesterday's market. Dacheng bed sheets also rose by 20,000 yuan. Dacheng blue crepe slightly rose by 157 yuan because it is the season. The rest was flat.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: There were slight differences in the opening prices in the morning. British and American cigarettes were traded more actively and showed a slight upward trend. Except for Beauty and Golden Mouse, the rest of the Chinese factory cigarettes fell slightly.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>A letter from the Shanghai Agricultural Products Market states that, having read the report "Questions Arise About the Organization of the Agricultural Products Market" published in your newspaper on March 14, we are providing point-by-point answers below to correct the record.</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai Agricultural Products Market is of course different in nature from the puppet Central Market. The Agricultural Products Market is an organization that regulates production and sales and balances supply and demand, with the aim of suppressing prices in a legitimate way through a rational system.</p>
<p>(2) The highest commission charged by the former puppet Central Market was 28%. The Agricultural Products Market's supervisory committee decided to charge a management fee of 1% of the transaction amount. It is self-evident whether this is a disguised form of taxation.</p>
<p>(3) If goods are transported to the market and managed in a unified manner, accurate statistics can be made to assist merchants in preparing for centralized procurement and sales.</p>
<p>(4) The market is a place for centralized trading, which is of great convenience to both supply and demand. The statement that incoming goods will inevitably be diverted to other ports is a blatant distortion of the facts.</p>
<p>(5) The municipal government's notice and the market's announcement inform the relevant industries and firms not to abandon their own interests and to quickly participate in business in order to achieve the mission of establishing the market. There is no coercion whatsoever.</p>

<h3>Professors at the Capital Provisional University Face Challenges - Deputy Minister Hang Promises to Forward Relief Request to the Executive Yuan - Will Also Come to Shanghai to Talk with University Professors</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] Professors Guo Shouchun, Shi Shiyuan, Ding Shan, and Pan Zunxing from the Capital Provisional University's Remedial Class, citing high living expenses and professor salaries that are lower than bank employees, telegraphed the Ministry of Education, appealing for relief. They also raised concerns about the future prospects of students in the remedial class after the completion of their studies. Deputy Minister Hang Liwu of the Ministry of Education scheduled a meeting with the professors at the Ministry of Education at around 4:00 PM on the 13th. The professors presented their opinions, and Deputy Minister Hang answered them one by one. Everyone deeply understood the Ministry of Education. Deputy Minister Hang stated that the high cost of living in Beijing and Shanghai is no less than that in Kunming. He promised to forward to the Executive Yuan the information on the meager salaries of the education sector, which are actually insufficient to cover living expenses, and request relief.</p>
<p>Planning for the Future Prospects of Students in Remedial Classes</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has a comprehensive plan for the future prospects of students in remedial classes. Students who pass the exam and meet the requirements will have a solution when the time comes.

Compared to the Preparatory Class, the treatment was too unequal. Deputy Minister Hang received them and promised to clear their salaries for February and March within a few days. It was also appropriately resolved that the starting salary would be calculated from the date of the appointment letter and that travel expenses would be subsidized. (Fool)</p>
<h3>Qingdao Municipal High School Changes to Full-Day Instruction System</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Qingdao] The original Dengzhou Road school building of Qingdao Municipal High School was used as barracks by the Japanese army during the Anti-Japanese War, and it was moved to Guizhou Road. Currently, the school has ten classes in the senior high school and twenty-four classes in the junior high school, for a total of thirty-four classes. The Guizhou Road school building has only fifteen classrooms, so teaching has always been carried out in a two-part system. The city's education authorities, fearing that the two-part teaching system would affect academic prospects, tried hard to change the two-part system to a full-day instruction system. Therefore, it has specially sought another school building for the ten classes of senior high school students to attend classes, so that the school building on Guizhou Road can be vacated for the use of the fifteen classes of junior high school students. The remaining nine classes will be transferred to CangKou Middle School and Rural Simple Normal School, with seven classes going to CangKou Middle School and two classes going to Rural Simple Normal School.</p>
<h3>Relief for Out-of-School Children in Hubei: Temporary Implementation of Half-Day, Two-Session System</h3>
<p>Mayor Xu's Statement</p>
<p>[New China News Agency, Hankou] Mayor Xu of Hankou, in order to alleviate the problem of primary school students in Hankou being out of school, recently issued the following statement: "Recently, the enrollment of students in various primary schools has felt crowded. The issue of school-age children being out of school has become a serious problem. The city government has been paying attention to this since receiving Hankou last year. After overcoming some difficulties, we managed to maintain the existing twenty-seven school buildings. Since January of this year, children who have come to Hankou from the rear have been accommodated by increasing classes and expanding enrollment in various schools. Currently, the capacity of each school building is full, and it is impossible to find new school buildings or add new schools. Therefore, children who have recently arrived in Hankou deeply feel the lack of places to study. As a last resort, we can only convert all school halls, libraries, and usable parts into classrooms, adding a total of sixty-one classes. Currently, funding and personnel are not a problem. As long as there are school buildings, the city government is still willing to continue to establish schools. In order to alleviate the current serious situation, we have ordered all schools to temporarily implement a half-day, two-session system, which can increase enrollment by 10,000 students. This is a temporary relief measure of last resort, and we hope that people from all walks of life can provide more assistance in terms of school buildings."</p>

<h3>Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Demand Improved Treatment, Host Politicians and Reporters</h3>
<p>[This city] Municipal primary and secondary schools and social education institutions in this city, because of high prices and difficult living conditions, previously elected representatives to demand improved treatment and increased educational expenses from the municipal authorities. Several petitions and talks have taken place, but there are still some gaps between the two sides. The most important issue is the number of months of emergency salary advances. The teachers and staff advocate that before the central government approves salaries based on the cost of living index, the bureau should approve an advance of 150,000 yuan per person per month, in addition to the original salary, limited to four months, with the funds being deducted from the education loan item. The bureau said that it is difficult to predict how much education loan funds can be raised, and only admits to temporarily approving advances of 50,000 to 80,000 yuan. The primary and secondary school teachers and staff believe that they must continue their efforts to achieve their goals. Yesterday noon, they specially hosted the city's politicians and newspaper reporters at the New Life Club. Politicians such as Tao Baichuan attended. On the newspaper side, representatives from the Central News Agency, New China News Agency, Zhengyan Daily, China-America Daily, and Xinwen Daily attended.

They reported in detail the purpose of requesting improved treatment and increased funding, as well as the process. Tao Baichuan then expressed his opinions, which were earnest and won applause from the entire audience. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Basketball League Finals Tonight: Hualian vs. Saco for Supremacy, Starting at 7:45 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium</h3>
<p>The final battle between Hualian and Saco in the basketball league is scheduled to take place at 7:45 PM this evening at the Municipal Gymnasium. This battle is tantamount to the final of the Group A division of the league. It is expected that there will be an unprecedented spectacle tonight. All of our basketball fans should arrive early to avoid disappointment.</p>
<p>Hualian has maintained its winning streak in the league, leading the pack. Saco has also repeatedly defeated strong teams, but unfortunately forfeited once. Therefore, Hualian is currently in a more advantageous position. If Hualian loses today, there is still hope for a rematch. If Saco loses today, there is no hope of winning the championship. Both teams have a wealth of experience and can be considered evenly matched. It is not easy to make a pre-match prediction about who will win. However, considering the height of Saco's forwards and their abundant stamina, Hualian should find a way to stop them. Whether Hualian can shoot accurately is also a major key to whether they can win today. The rosters of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>[Hualian] Li Zhenzhong, Kong Guangyi, Bao Songyuan, Wu Chengzhang, Chen Xuesong, Zhang Liangxiong</p>
<p>[Saco] Anderson, Liege, Hertolai, Dang Le, Parker, Peterson, Kang Qulang, Gao Futuo.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>In yesterday's three matches, Renyu easily defeated Liufenwei by a landslide. The first half was 30 to 9, and the final result was 68 to 21, with Renyu winning.

The first half was 30 to 26, and the final result was 70 to 60, with Xingzhong triumphing. In the final match, the Shan team defeated the Lan team. The first half was 24 to 20. The Lan team made extraordinary efforts, but the Shan team showed its power in the second half, finally defeating the Lan team 48 to 38.</p>
<h3>Important Basketball Programs Broadcast Starting Next Week</h3>
<p>In order to arouse the interest of all circles and facilitate basketball fans who cannot come to the venue, as well as allow basketball fans in other cities to hear the battle situation on the radio, the basketball league office has contacted the Shanghai Radio Station to broadcast live from the venue. It was originally scheduled to start today, but due to the connection relationship of the Telephone Bureau, it will have to wait until next week to install the equipment. Therefore, today's Hualian-Saco battle cannot be broadcast. The league office is very sorry, but it can be implemented from next week. This can be said to be one of the successes of the basketball league work.</p>

<h3>Will a Trojan Horse Government Appear in China? Broadcast Speech by Powell and Emmet at the Sino-American Relations Symposium</h3>
<p>Amidst the succession of strikes from various sectors, at least one glimmer of hope shines through these bad tidings, namely, the cessation of China's civil war and the imminent realization of the long-awaited national unity between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>If this is indeed the case, it would be welcome news to the vast majority of the American people. We not only admire the courage and patience displayed by the Chinese people during their long and arduous struggle, but also, most Americans are deeply aware that China has been fighting our common enemy for longer than any other allied nation, while receiving less material assistance from our Lend-Lease Act than any other allied nation.</p>
<p>China's Significant Progress</p>
<p>From 1927 to 1937, China made great strides in these ten years, demonstrating the ability of ancient Chinese culture to adapt to the conditions of a new era. Japan launched its full-scale war of aggression in 1937 precisely because it had long feared this progress. Consequently, various plans, such as national industrialization, opening up transportation for national unity, and promoting education for the implementation of democracy, were all interrupted. A very small amount of industry and transportation lines were also destroyed. Although China trained tens of thousands of adults to read and write during the war, it was still far from the level of intellectual development required for the implementation of democracy.</p>
<p>Since full democracy requires national unity and education as prerequisites, Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China, stipulated that the Kuomintang should implement tutelage until the foundations of democracy were established. However, due to the outbreak of war, the measures for tutelage were delayed.</p>
<p>Avoiding the Threat of Civil War</p>
<p>While the Kuomintang forces suffered fierce attacks from the Japanese army, the Communist Party took the opportunity to consolidate its position. After the peace, it threatened to launch a full-scale civil war. To avoid the realization of this threat, the United States used increasing pressure to promote compromise. This is the purpose of General Marshall's mission today.</p>
<p>It is reported that the negotiations for unity and unification will be successful, but the same rumors have been heard before. And the same, almost insurmountable difficulties, still exist. The key to the success of organizing any coalition government in China is not only whether it can reconcile the differences between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but also whether it can concentrate enough strength to cope with the vast and unpredictable administrative contingencies. The pressing issues that need to be resolved will be discussed below:</p>
<p>Reviewing the Issue of Returning the Capital</p>
<p>The first thing at hand is to move the government from the wartime capital, Chongqing, back to Nanjing. The distance is 1,500 miles, and the only available means of transportation, apart from a limited number of transport aircraft, is by boat down the Yangtze River. At the same time, the return to the capital brings with it a very serious political consideration, namely, the excessive number of people in Chongqing who rely on government subsidies for a living.</p>
<p>Someone once imagined this scenario: Suppose we had to move the capital from Washington to Missouri, and then back to Washington, with the only means of transportation being by boat down the Ohio, and then up the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, what would become of the civil servants in Washington?</p>
<p>Leaving aside purely domestic affairs, including the most serious relief issues, and temporarily setting aside the difficult situation created by the Soviet Union in Manchuria, the serious problems facing China lie in readjusting its relations with foreign countries and considering foreign interests in China, based on the new treaties signed during the war of resistance. It has recently been learned that France, which previously intended to abandon consular jurisdiction, is now unwilling to do so, claiming that the treaty has not yet been signed, while the United States and Britain have already abandoned consular jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Foreign firms intend to reopen under the new circumstances, but according to reports, they are currently finding it quite difficult. China insists that all foreign firms must re-register in accordance with the provisions of Chinese law, and some foreigners say that under these regulations, foreign firms cannot operate.</p>
<p>The above is just a part of the various problems facing the government, but all problems are related to politically explosive issues. One of the sticks used by the Communist Party to attack the government is that the central government is excessively serving as a tool for foreigners, especially for Americans and Britons. At the beginning of the war, the Chinese Red Army attacked the Chongqing government as a puppet government of the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>The matter of seeking unity between the Communist Party and the government in China must be considered in light of the need for a strong government to solve specific construction problems. It is doubtful to what extent Chairman Chiang can give up his control and the control of the party he inherited from Sun Yat-sen without causing even greater disruption to the administrative system than exists today. Because the period of tutelage has not been completed, can the necessary administrative control be safely shared with the CCP? In addition, there is the Democratic League, but this party is a collection of intellectuals, and its organizational strength is very weak. The only parties truly qualified to form a government are the Kuomintang or the Communist Party, or a coalition of the two.</p>
<p>The CCP Joins the Government</p>
<p>The question of whether Chairman Chiang will allow the Communist Party to join the government is the same as the difficult problem that de Gaulle faced in France after the war. The comparison between the two makes it easy to understand. Although France is an advanced democracy and the electorate is highly educated, it suffered greatly before the war because the power of the administrative institutions was too weak, which was one of the reasons why it was defeated by the Nazis. After the war, de Gaulle and his comrades drafted a new constitution under the Fourth Republic, strengthening the power of the administrative institutions so that the democratic government could be stable. In short, the constitution drafted by de Gaulle largely imitated the American presidential system, concentrating power in the hands of the president, and granting the president even greater powers in times of emergency.</p>
<p>Before the new constitution was implemented, de Gaulle was again the president in charge of administration, stipulating some transitional powers. General de Gaulle was willing to allow members of the Communist Party to join his cabinet, and he had already ordered them to join. However, he refused to allow Communist Party members to serve as cabinet members related to foreign policy and national defense, because he could not trust them due to the Communist Party's loyalty to foreign governments. Because of this attitude, de Gaulle was forced to resign by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Assuming that de Gaulle's position is logical and can gain the support of democrats in France and around the world, will Chairman Chiang's firm attitude towards the Communist Party be more justified? The Chinese Communist Party has an army, while the French Communist Party does not. The distance between the French and Russian borders is hundreds of miles, while the border between China and Russia is longer than the border between any two neighboring countries in the world.</p>
<p>Those who usually defend the Communist Party say that the Chinese Communist Party is not Marxist and has no connection with Moscow. They also say that the Chinese Communist Party members are just simple farmers who are only interested in improving the welfare of farmers. Can we believe this?</p>
<p>Recently, when the Chinese Red Army seized a strategic stronghold – Zhangjiakou – on the border of Inner Mongolia, northwest of Beiping, their actions showed another motive. Mr. Steele has written a brilliant article on this in the *Forward Forum*. The methods used by the Red Army in Zhangjiakou are very similar to the Red Terror that the Communist Party used to use when it participated in the National Revolution in 1927. This Red Terror was ultimately responsible for the break between the Kuomintang and the Russian Trotskyites who led the Chinese Communist Party at that time. The *New York Times* published the following editorial satirizing what the Chinese Communist Party has done in Zhangjiakou recently:</p>
<p>"When the Chinese Communist Party seizes a county seat, the first thing they do is arrest their enemies and shoot them if necessary. The second thing they do is divide the land among the people and announce a 100% increase in wages. The third thing they do is set up a secret police and concentration camps. They only allow the publication of official gazettes and official documents, and prohibit all opposition gatherings. When you read this, don't mistake them for communists. They are simple farmers in China."</p>
<p>"They are not communists but reformers," this statement has been heard often since we came into contact with Chinese society. And have not the Communist Parties in Southern France, Yugoslavia, Mexico, the United States, and Brazil made the same statement? None of today's Communist Parties adhere to the old methods of the past Communist Party. In order to achieve their strategies, they do not hesitate to cooperate with Vargas, the stubborn dictator of Brazil, the stubborn elements of the Democratic Party in New York (Tammary elements), and the former Fascists in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Therefore, the examination of a modern Communist Party lies not in its loyalty to Marx, but in its loyalty to Stalin. This is why General de Gaulle refused to give members of the Communist Party important cabinet positions.</p>
<p>Is it in the interest of the United States to force Chairman Chiang to do so?</p>
<p>Lin Yutang's Reply to Snow</p>
<p>In response to Snow's book review of his book "Vigil of a Nation," published in the *National* magazine on March 24, 1945, Lin Yutang made the following summary of the debate published by the Chinese Communist Party:</p>
<p>"If someone thinks that the Chinese Communist Party is similar to Communist Parties in other countries, it is a strange thing. Then the record of the CCP's loyalty to Moscow will certainly make those who think it is strange no longer think it is strange. When Stalin joined hands with Hitler, the CCP strictly maintained an isolated attitude. Mao Zedong (who was an executive member of the CCP from 1935 to 1943) was extremely anti-American and anti-British. I cannot forgive anyone who ignores and reports these facts. Hitler was scolded as a "mad dog" before concluding a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union, was respected as a head of state during the duration of the treaty, and became a despicable animal again after June 22, 1941. I can list more than a dozen editorials and their dates from Chongqing's *Xinhua Daily*. What is the content of "Not Participating in the European War" on May 21, 1941? It is also strange that this article was published only 40 days before June 22. What is the content of "A Dead End" on April 25, 1940? This article is calling for participation in the European War. Mao Zedong demanded absolute neutrality and accused Roosevelt's Lend-Lease Act to Britain of being false neutrality, attempting to drag the United States into the Second Imperialist War. The Communist Party allowed Stalin to recognize the Japanese "Manchukuo" border. Mao Zedong called the British and American imperialists "sons of bitches," and scolded the Japanese imperialists in the same tone on page 45 of *On New Democracy*. Mao hated anyone who said that the British and Americans were different from the Japanese imperialists."</p>
<p>Recently, Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Red Army, wrote a small book entitled "On New Democracy." The popular edition published in New York had a preface by Browder, a Communist leader in the United States who had been expelled. This book is the latest statement of the Chinese Communist Party, encouraging all loyal Communists to work hard to study it, regardless of their nationality. The main points of the book are widely quoted by spokespersons and speakers of the Chinese Red Army in the United States. In short, the purpose of Mao's book is to explain the Red Army leaders' views on negotiation and the principles of democracy and communism.</p>
<p>Recently, from research materials collected by Americans (one of whom is a Catholic priest), I obtained a propaganda booklet. This book will amaze anyone familiar with Communist propaganda tactics. The original Chinese version sold in the United States is slightly different from the version sold in China in terms of materials.</p>

<h3>Sino-American Friendship</h3>
<p>Time does not allow for a detailed review of the above two books, but when Mao Zedong denounces democratic countries, including China, the United States, and Britain, as bourgeois bloody military dictatorships, he often mentions the word Original.</p>
<p>Regarding Sino-American friendship, Mao said that China will be in a puppet position, just like the Wang Jingwei Nanjing puppet regime, naturally excluding the Soviet Union. Mao expressed extreme hatred for democratic countries throughout the book, saying that China's joining the democratic alliance has already fallen into a trap. He said that cooperating with democratic countries during the war is no more possible than "serving God and serving wealth."</p>
<p>The main point of this book is to answer the question of "Is the Chinese Communist Party a true Communist Party?" Mao's answer is that they are a true Communist Party, and their hatred of the American democratic system and its effects is unquestionable.</p>
<p>We already know that although de Gaulle won the support of a majority of the French people in the last election – I believe that Chairman Chiang can also win the support of a majority of the people – it is still useless. De Gaulle believed that unless the French Parliament authorized him to exercise great power and clearly stipulated this in the new constitution, he would not be able to rely on the support of the majority of the people to oppose the well-organized minority Communist Party that has foreign assistance, in order to continue to rule France.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that if we force Chairman Chiang to give the CCP a portion of political power, it will be enough to force China into the Soviet sphere of influence and never return. Sino-American friendship and the Open Door Policy that we have always advocated will be sacrificed because of this.</p>
<p>The CCP's view of us has been expressed not only in words and print, but also in military actions in the North China American military zone. The Chinese Communist Party does not want our help in Asia; they only need Soviet cooperation. Therefore, some students demand that the U.S. military withdraw from China and send the U.S. military back home. The intention is here. Today, we are once again encountering the resurgence of the Communist isolationist alliance, which did its best to prevent American aid to China and Britain during the period when Hitler and Stalin joined hands.</p>
<p>U.S. troops stationed in China have been ambushed by the Communist army, U.S. pilots have been shot at by the Red Army, and U.S. pilots have been detained in the Red Army area. All of this is more important than anything else. The fact that the American army and navy were shot at by hostile Chinese troops is the first time since the Boxer Rebellion half a century ago. When we want to force the Chinese Nationalist government, which fought with us and for us during the war, to accommodate the Communist Party, we must seriously consider such incidents.</p>
<p>A better policy (and it is not too late to implement this policy) is to force the Communist Party to make concessions, rather than forcing Chairman Chiang. If we support the basic authority that Chairman Chiang needs and his legitimate government, we will have more power to promote the reform of the Kuomintang's internal political organization – this party now contains corrupt and stubborn elements. The more the Communist Party's power in China is strengthened, the more Chairman Chiang and anti-Communist liberals will rely on stubborn elements to prevent the Communist Party from usurping power. Most Chinese people, like other nations, would rather have stubborn or corrupt politics exist than have a "Trojan Horse Government" (i.e., a Chinese puppet government under the command of foreign dictators) appear.

<h3>Random Notes from an Inspection with Marshal Marshall (3)</h3>
<p>— Sent by Special Correspondent Zhang Jianmei in Beiping</p>
<p>Mao's Wife: The Flower of Yan'an</p>
<p>(Dispatch from this newspaper, dated the 12th)</p>
<p>Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, is a flower of Yan'an. The wind and sand of the border region have not broken her charm in the past eight years. She is still beautiful and moving, wearing a tightly buttoned pine-yellow army呢 (n呢, a type of wool fabric) overcoat. Inside is a brand new gray wool suit, as if it had just been ironed. The wool vest showing at her chest seems to be covered with a layer of snow. She told us that she returned to Yan'an from Chongqing with Zhou Enlai on the 19th of last month, two days later than what was reported in the newspapers. "Chongqing has one drawback," she said, slightly lifting her head and gesturing with her right hand, "there is too little sunlight!" "So is the climate in Yan'an good?" "It's okay. The climate here is relatively dry – but I grew up in a marine climate," "So do you hope to return to Shanghai?" She was a little embarrassed, "I hope so." A friend jokingly said, "You should persuade Mr. Mao to go to Nanjing, and then you can return to Shanghai." She smiled shyly. "If there is a chance, would you be willing to appear on stage or on the silver screen again?" She considered for a moment and said, "Whatever work our organization wants me to do, I will do." She looked at the reporter's business card, which represented *Shen Bao*, and asked, "Does *Shen Bao* still publish a large stack of newspapers every day?" As she spoke, she used her thumb and index finger to gesture the thickness and number of pages of *Shen Bao*. "*Shen Bao*'s..."</p>
<h3>Sister Cai Chats About the Women's Movement</h3>
<p>The famous "Sister Cai" (named Cai Chang, wife of Li Fuchun) in Yan'an was at our table during dinner. She is a leader in the women's movement in Yan'an and was elected as a member of the CCP Central Committee at the National Congress last year. She said that the focus of the CCP's current women's movement work is to guide rural women to work hard in agricultural production, to let them know midwifery and infant care knowledge (especially to pay attention to the improvement of midwifery, because the population mortality rate in the border area, especially the infant and women's mortality rate, is very high), to help stabilize families, and not to encourage divorce. The reporter asked, "Isn't this reverting to the doctrine of a good wife and a wise mother?" Her answer was, "That depends on what kind of meaning it is under." Clearly, the CCP's rule in the poor rural areas also needs tens of thousands of "farm women" of the good wife and wise mother type to be its pillars.</p>
<p>After the Japanese surrendered, the intellectuals in Yan'an flocked east to Zhangjiakou. Almost all of them left, except for a few people like Ai Siqi, Chen Boda, and Zhang Zhongshi to look after the house. From Ai Siqi's civil servant-like face and cotton army uniform, you couldn't tell that he was a philosopher. In these years, he didn't publish any large books, but only worked hard to prepare some policies and outlines suitable for the CCP's needs in a national form and instill them into the farmers, soldiers, and masses. Chen Boda wore a white towel around his neck instead of a scarf. Zhang Zhongshi was also wearing a cotton army uniform. He said that since coming to the border area, he has been able to concentrate on writing and research without worrying about living problems, because everything he needs is issued to him.</p>
<h3>Secretary Luo Talks a Lot About the Political Situation</h3>
<p>Let me write a little about the political situation in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Luo Mai, Secretary-General of the Border Region Government, said that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region covers an area of 90,000 square kilometers and is currently divided into 29 counties and one city with a population of 1.5 million, an army of 30,000, and an administrative staff of between 15,000 and 18,000. The total grain production in the region is 1.6 million shi (石, a unit of dry measure) per year, and the people's burden of public grain is less than 10% – the earliest national salvation public grain was 200,000 shi per year, but later, due to the self-sufficiency movement of military and political personnel, it was reduced to 180,000 shi in the 32nd year, 160,000 shi in the 33rd year, and 120,000 shi last year. The past salt-grain public money (in the past, people had to transport salt for the government, and they could not transport salt produced by the government, so they paid salt-grain public money) has been exempted this year. The people's burden has been gradually reduced. In terms of agriculture, all that has been achieved in these years is to organize the labor conditions in the countryside (plowing cattle, labor, farming tools, seeds) to prevent waste. In terms of industry, the government has tried its best to promote cotton planting and spinning, planting 300,000 mu (畝, a unit of land measure) of cotton, and harvesting more than 200,000 dan (担, a unit of weight measure) of cotton. In two or three years, the border region is expected to be self-sufficient in cotton. He also said that the currency inflation in the border region has reached an alarming level. At present, the value of one *shi* of millet in the border region is 400,000 border dollars. A middle school teacher earns about 1.2 *shi* to 1.5 *shi* of grain per month, which translates to 480,000 to 600,000 border dollars. This is even more alarming than the amount of legal currency salary received by government employees in the rear. This kind of rapid inflation made them feel that the printing of border dollars was not enough, so they imitated the customs gold (關金) method and issued another kind of circulating note similar to customs gold through trading companies. One yuan of circulating note is equal to 20 yuan of border dollars (issued by the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Bank). Currently, the denominations of the circulating notes are 10 yuan, 100 yuan, 200 yuan, 250 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and even 2,000 yuan. (The ratio of legal currency to border dollars is currently one to ten, and the ratio to circulating notes is 0.5 to one yuan. You do the math!) The degree of currency inflation is actually even greater than that of legal currency. The border region government is quite troubled by this problem. Secretary-General Luo sincerely said, "We are really unable to recover so many border dollars circulating notes. We hope that the central government will protect the law and recover them in the future."</p>
<p>Now that there is peace, where will Yan'an go? The *Times* reported that Mao Zedong has already been looking for a house in Nanjing. Some people say that Chongqing + Yan'an = Nanjing. It seems that the formula can also be corrected to Chongqing + Yan'an + Washington = Nanjing.</p>
<p>The mysterious color of Yan'an will be diluted in the torrent of peace. Maybe there will be no more journalists going to Yan'an tomorrow.</p>
<p>Therefore, some Communist Party members have suggested building a historical museum in Yan'an. (March 11, in Beiping)</p>

<h3>Reader Opinions: Preferential Treatment Should Be Given in Handling Pre-War Public Bonds</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>The methods a nation uses to remedy financial difficulties are none other than increasing taxes, printing more money, and issuing public bonds. Increasing taxes is too slow timewise. Printing more money easily leads to inflation. Issuing public bonds can contract the currency, absorb idle funds, and provide investment avenues for the people. Therefore, issuing public bonds is a good way to relieve financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Our country issued five types of unified public bonds in the 25th year of the Republic [1936]. The total amount was 750 million yuan. Ten years have passed, and the currency has inflated due to the war. If the government still repays the principal and interest at the original amount, it would be tantamount to the nation defaulting on its debt to the people. However, there are many historical precedents of nations defaulting on foreign debt, but there has never been a case of defaulting on domestic public bonds. Even Germany, after the First World War, although a defeated nation, had preferential treatment measures when reorganizing its currency system to pay for public bonds. Now that our country is a victorious nation, is there any reason not to provide preferential treatment for public bonds when reorganizing the currency system after the war? The people are the foundation of the nation. If the nation loses the people's trust, it will be difficult to issue public bonds in the event of future financial difficulties.</p>
<p>The authorities issuing the Sun Yat-sen banknotes have repeatedly stated that all rumors are untrue. However, reorganizing the currency system is a step that the nation must take to seek progress after inflation. President Song [Ziwen] also stated in his political report that "the currency system can only be reorganized after prices stabilize." Therefore, cracking down on speculation is one thing, and handling public bonds is another; the two should not be confused. I hope the wise authorities will quickly devise appropriate measures to handle pre-war public bonds and prevent the people of the whole country from losing their patriotic faith again. It should be known that many people invested in public bonds before the war as savings and pensions. Not only have they not received a single cent of interest during this period of resistance against Japan, but now, after the victory, they are still receiving devalued legal tender, which is surely a serious blow to those who enthusiastically invested in the nation. (Zhang Peihang)</p>
<h3>How Foolish are Strikes and Work Slowdowns</h3>
<p>Opening the newspapers of the past few months, news of work slowdowns and strikes is almost a daily occurrence. Employees take this action out of desperation for a living, which is understandable, but the result is still a losing proposition. Because in the past, during the national crisis, capitalists took advantage of traffic jams and shortages of materials to speculate and hoard, manipulating the market. Their profits were calculated in multiples. Now, although victory has been achieved, their mindset of getting rich has not changed. Our employees' demands for improved treatment are like digging into their flesh, which they are unwilling to grant readily. Even if they allow it, the money will come out of the consumers’ pockets, raising prices and increasing interest rates; even their markups exceed what they pay out. They say to the outside world: "In order to maintain the livelihood of employees, we have no choice but to increase prices." We employees, however, have only had our wages increased by a small amount, while all prices have increased several times. Expenses are even higher, and we still cannot make ends meet. Therefore, striking for a living—raising prices to adjust treatment—striking because of high prices and insecure livelihoods—in this way, the matter of strikes and work slowdowns becomes a cyclical ailment, one rising as the other falls, and it is not easy to solve at once.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, during this transitional period, we must understand the position of each individual, we must be able to endure hardship, we do not need to harbor any extravagant hopes, and we do not need to look up and request that the capitalists improve our treatment. We can monitor the capitalists in our respective positions, not allowing them to increase prices on any pretext, and not allowing them to obtain excessive profits. For example, in factories, we can calculate the cost of raw material purchase prices, manufacturing costs, and all expenses to determine its cost, plus a legal profit, which can be used as the wholesale price, requesting that the factory not sell it above this value. In stores, companies, and banks, this method can also be used. In addition to legal profits, they must not raise selling prices or charge illegal high interest rates. If the capitalists cannot accept our request, we can expose the facts and let society punish them. I believe that with this method, as long as the employees of several large factories, large stores, large companies, and large banks implement it consistently, not fearing threats and not being tempted by benefits, city-wide prices may generally fall in the short term. We are performing this work for the sake of social stability and the livelihood of the masses, and the people will surely express their sympathy for us.</p>

<h3>China Should Join the International Copyright Convention</h3>
<p>— Yuan Da</p>
<p>Now that China has won the war and become one of the five great powers, we really should catch up quickly in many ways to adapt to this newly acquired honor and status, so as to avoid remaining in a backward and lagging position.</p>
<p>One of these things that has a direct relationship with Chinese writers and the publishing industry is that China should quickly join the International Copyright Convention. This is related to the interests of writers and publishers, and to the status and reputation of the entire nation.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Shu Sheyu (Lao She), a Chinese writer who was invited by the US government to lecture abroad, had a novel called "Rickshaw Boy" translated into English, published in the US, and became a bestseller. This can be said to be a very glorious thing for China and for Mr. Lao She personally. Mr. Lao She's life has been spent in hardship for decades, even to the point of suffering from anemia and malnutrition. This may not matter to the steadfast and outstanding Mr. Lao She, but his relatives and readers who love literature really cannot stand it. Before his trip abroad, I talked to him about the royalty issue of the translated version of "Rickshaw Boy." He said that he had no say in the matter because China has not joined the International Copyright Convention at all. Therefore, in law, we have no standing to ask for royalties from others. Therefore, how much royalty the original author should get can only depend on what the translator gives. And now, Mr. Lao She's family relies on a limited sum of royalties given by that translator as part of their living expenses.</p>
<p>The reason why China should join the International Copyright Convention is not only to ensure that the copyrights of our country's writers are protected so that they can obtain the royalties they deserve; more importantly, it is to enable China and Chinese writers, translators, and publishers to stand properly in the international community and receive international attention and reputation.</p>
<p>We hope that people in China's cultural and publishing circles will pay attention to this issue.</p>
<h3>On Democratic Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>— Ping Fan</p>
<p>Author: Chen Qitian</p>
<p>Publisher: Commercial Press</p>
<p>Date: Chongqing, 1944</p>
<p>Shanghai Revised Edition, October 1945</p>
<p>Pages: 219</p>
<p>Democratic politics is the main trend of modern world culture, and this trend is surging in China. Unfortunately, most people only use the word "democracy" as a slogan for political activities, and it is truly not a blessing for the nation if they do not have a clear understanding of the true meaning of democracy. Those who lead youth activities and the youths who like to engage in political and social activities still need to have a correct understanding of this aspect. The way to understand this is to study more books of this kind, rather than spending all of one's energy on a certain political ideology or blindly following a few people. I am introducing this book to truly do something for the youth of China in this area.</p>
<p>The book is divided into thirteen chapters. Each chapter was originally published separately, so it seems to lack systematism. However, the theory is consistent, and the style is the same. Chapter Seven explains the development of China's efforts in the constitutional movement in the past fifty years. Chapter One discusses the relationship between democratic constitutionalism and political construction. Mr. Chen believes that politics is the general pivot of the overall national situation, and democratic constitutionalism is the general policy of China's political construction. He said in the preface to the first edition: "To demand the success of nation-building, democratic constitutionalism must be implemented; to demand that everyone can be a human being, democratic constitutionalism must be implemented; to demand that everyone can save the country, democratic constitutionalism must be implemented." Chapter Two is about the implementation of democratic constitutionalism. The main question is whether it should be implemented during the war, which is no longer a question, so there is no need to introduce it further.</p>
<p>Chapter Three explains the principles of democratic constitutionalism: (1) New politics is public-spirited politics rather than private politics. Public-spirited people refer to those who are talented and can handle public affairs impartially, regardless of their personal relationships or their advancement and retreat based on personal relationships. (2) New politics is public law politics rather than private law politics; it uses "the law of the world" rather than "the law of the family." (3) New politics is public interest politics rather than private interest politics. (4) It is politics of principle rather than politics of power. (5) It is government by the people rather than government by officials. (6) It is practical politics rather than hypocritical politics.</p>
<p>Chapter Four discusses what the demeanor of people in democratic constitutionalism should be. The author believes that a true politician engaged in democratic constitutionalism must abide by eight tenets: (1) One should not use foreign aid as a background. "Purely foreign parties must absolutely not engage in political activities in this country. Even parties in this country should not borrow foreign aid to engage in internal strife... Moreover, if a party uses foreign aid as a background, it will inevitably cause the country to fall into division, becoming a one-party country, with each side fighting to the death, and how can we talk about democratic constitutionalism?" (2) One should not use force as a backing. In a truly democratic constitutionalist country, all military forces must be national defense forces, only for external purposes, not internal purposes. (3) One should not use conspiracy as a means. All those engaged in political activities should treat each other with an open attitude. (4) One should not take monopoly as an objective. Any party, although its methods may be different, its ultimate goal should be the happiness of the people of this country. "Factional politics is already unacceptable, and monopoly politics is even more unacceptable." (5) All political actors must respect public opinion. People must be allowed freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association regarding politics. (6) One must respect justice. "Allowing oneself to be involved in politics but not allowing others to be involved in politics is inequality and injustice." Therefore, all political actors should have both the spirit of fair competition and mutual tolerance. (7) All political activities must respect laws and disciplines. Laws and disciplines are the public track of democratic constitutionalism. Everyone has freedom within the laws and disciplines. Everyone must be equal before the laws and disciplines, and there should be no privileged classes. Orders must not change laws, and laws must not change the constitution. (8) One must respect responsibility. Therefore, under democratic constitutionalism, there must be statutory public opinion organs to hold administrative organs accountable. Administrative organs must respect public opinion organs in order to respect responsibility.</p>
<p>In Chapter Five, the author states the differences between democratic and non-democratic politics. He says that, firstly, democratic politics must have a government commonly owned by all the people; secondly, since democratic politics only needs a government owned by the people, the government must be governed by the people to establish a government of the people; thirdly, in democratic politics, there is no distinction between the ruling class and the ruled class, and it becomes a government enjoyed by the people; fourthly, under democratic politics, since the government is owned, governed, and enjoyed by the people, the people easily merge with the government into one. From these characteristics, we discover that democratic politics is more rational, harmonious, and stable than all non-democratic politics, and it is indeed a long-term and stable political system.</p>
<p>Chapter Six discusses the philosophical background of democratic politics. Here, the author again discusses it from two aspects. On one hand, he talks about the political philosophy of democratic politics, and on the other hand, he talks about the philosophy of life of democratic politics. In political philosophy, he explains several basic theories: (1) The state and the government should be strictly separated; (2) It should be that people rule themselves, so that ruling and being ruled are intertwined; (3) People should have rights and freedoms, which belong to the whole; (4) The rule of law and the rule of man are combined into one; (5) In democratic politics, on the one hand, an order must be established, and on the other hand, it must be constantly reformed to promote progress. As for the philosophy of life of democratic politics, it should contain three major meanings: (1) Group and self are mutually inclusive; (2) Self and others are one; (3) Morality and intelligence are cultivated together. A democratic personality should have five elements: (1) Independent spirit, (2) Cooperative spirit, (3) Fighting spirit, (4) Upright spirit, (5) Practical spirit.</p>
<p>Chapter Nine explains how to complete a democratic political structure. Here, the author says, (1) Public affairs and private affairs should be clearly distinguished. (2) Government and parties should be distinct. In a multi-party system, government officials should advance and retreat with the parties to clarify political responsibility, which is permissible, even necessary. However, civil servants should be non-partisan. (3) Public opinion and official opinion are different. The way to distinguish between public opinion and official opinion is to allow and respect the opposition party's criticism and supervision in parliament. (4) Politics should be distinct from military affairs. If someone uses secret means and violent means to solve political problems, then political disputes become civil wars, which are not enough to be called politics. (5) The judiciary should be separated from the administration. This requires abolishing the tradition of not separating judicial administration, not abusing military law, not allowing party activities to invade the courts, and not arbitrarily arresting, detaining, and punishing the secret organs of the people.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the author discusses the success or failure of politics, he believes that (1) Politics that is open-minded and progresses with the times is easy to succeed. (2) Politics that takes the world as its own is easy to succeed; otherwise, it will surely fail. (3) Politics that allows public opinion and criticism and supervision from the opposition is easy to succeed; otherwise, it will surely fail. (4) Politics in which the law has authority is easy to succeed. (5) Politics that makes good use of power is easy to succeed; politics that abuses power will surely fail.</p>
<p>Democracy is not only a new politics but also a new life; not only a new system but also a new demeanor; not only a new knowledge but also a new habit. Therefore, we not only focus on new politics, new systems, and new knowledge, but we also need to pay more attention to new life, new demeanor, and new habits. This requires us to learn everything. As for the method of learning, we should pay attention to two points: (1) We must learn democracy in the struggle for democracy; (2) We must learn democracy in the practice of democracy.</p>
<p>Chapter Eight introduces Russell's recent book "Power," and also discusses democratic politics and Chinese politics, which should be listed in the appendix. Other chapters with many repetitions are omitted. To get a glimpse of the whole picture, please read the original book.</p>
<h3>Reading "Secondary School Guidance"</h3>
<p>— Wu Zijia</p>
<p>Recently, I spent several evenings reading Mr. Yang Tongfang's "Secondary School Guidance," and I feel that it does have unique insights. The book is published by World Book Company and listed as a New Education Series. It has been published for three years, but it was sealed up by the enemy and puppets at the time, and only after the victory was it unsealed and sold.</p>
<p>Speaking of educational reform, many people advocate starting with secondary school education, because the objects of education during this period are young people whose bodies and minds are developing rapidly. They need basic knowledge and a rich life. The former belongs to the infusion of knowledge and ability, and the latter is the cultivation of moral education. It can be seen that in secondary schools, "teaching" and "guidance" should be equally emphasized. The failure of our country's secondary school education is largely due to the separation of "teaching" and "guidance" (of course, unifying "teaching" and "guidance" is not something that can be achieved simply by merging the "teaching affairs office" and the "guidance office" into a "teaching and guidance office.) and the poor traditional guidance methods.</p>
<p>This book emphasizes the relationship between "teaching" and "guidance," and provides methods for improving secondary school guidance in response to national weaknesses and social needs, so that we can recognize the goals of guidance and the steps of implementation. The author has a good understanding of education and is able to discard those mechanical and rigid principles, use correct theories as the basis, and express his opinions on improving guidance. Although the book is divided into many chapters, it still allows us to find a central idea: Guidance is the whole of life; it is not only passive management, but must enlighten students' moral ideals and seek the cultivation of sound personality. The process of guidance should be from external, prescriptive, to internal, self-disciplined. Unless guidance is infused into the entire life of students, it will not receive true effect.</p>
<p>The scope of secondary school guidance is very large, and the subjects involved include education, psychology, ethics, society, philosophy, and other fields. All factors that can affect students' behavior must be taken into account. In the past, there were no such systematic monographs published, and those published in Britain and the United States were not entirely suitable for national conditions. Therefore, this work that studies the principles and implementation of secondary school guidance is very much needed today. There are elaborations on the physiological and psychological state of secondary school students, social and ethical factors, and the philosophical foundation of secondary school guidance. There is also detailed discussion of the relationship between secondary school guidance and teaching, the moral effects of various subjects, extracurricular activities, and student autonomy, and many practical materials are cited. The issue of youth training is given a special chapter, which describes the current situation of youth training in various countries and the path that China's youth training should take in the future. Sex education occupies a very important position in secondary school guidance, and it is also clearly described, with emphasis on implementation methods, which can break the traditional thinking of general secondary school teachers. The book speaks very thoroughly about the defects of our country's secondary school guidance, and also compares the advantages and disadvantages of various existing guidance systems, pointing out how to determine the goals and methods of guidance in the future.</p>
<p>I feel that the greatest advantage of this book is that it permeates the knowledge of emerging mental hygiene and explains how to apply the principles of mental hygiene to the implementation of guidance. On this point, not only is there a lot of description in Chapter Three, but also the principles of mental hygiene can be fully applied in other chapters, and the materials can be called novel. Although, as the author said, this book can be used as a textbook, I think that it does not have the dryness of a general "textbook," and people who study youth issues should also take a look at it.</p>
<p>Today's China has already stepped onto the stage of nation-building, and we must first cultivate those young people who will shoulder the important task of nation-building in the future, especially those secondary school students who are between elementary school and university, so that they can all become vanguards of nation-building with sound personalities, noble ideals, and a willingness to advance and sacrifice. Those who are responsible for guiding young people! How should they follow young people's psychology, understand national needs, and use positive and rational guidance methods to guide these fresh cells of the nation—the youth—so that they become citizens with sound bodies and minds, which is the greatest need at present. After reading "Secondary School Guidance," I thought of these issues.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic History of the Republic of China (1)</h3>
<p>— Mei Ru'ao</p>
<p>Written by Zhang Zhongfu, published by Zhengzhong Book Company, textbook for universities</p>
<p>Shanghai First Edition, November 1945, 25mo, 430 pages</p>
<p>The author of this article, Mr. Mei Ru'ao, is a legal authority in our country, and has served as a professor at the Central Political Academy and Central University, and a member of the Legislative Yuan of the Legislative Yuan. Recently, General MacArthur established the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo to try war criminals, and Mr. Mei was honorably appointed as the chief judge of our country. He recently came to Shanghai on his way to Japan, and in the midst of his busy schedule, he wrote this to grace our publication, for which we are sincerely grateful.</p>
<p>Until now, I have only discovered a relatively good diplomatic history of China, which is Mr. Zhang Zhongfu's Diplomatic History of the Republic of China. Mr. Zhang has served as a professor at Nankai University and the head of the Department of Political Science at National Peking University for many years. Recently, he served as a counselor of the Military Affairs Commission and the director of the American Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His knowledge and experience are both first-rate. His book "The Anglo-Japanese Alliance" has long been widely known and praised for a time. It is an indispensable reference work for those who study diplomacy in the West. This book is the crystallization of Mr. Zhang's years of research and teaching experience. It goes without saying that it is a valuable work. Unfortunately, only the first volume has been published now, and the publication of the second volume is still awaited. According to the author in the preface: "The discussion only covers the period from 1911 (the Xinhai Revolution) to 1921 (the Washington Conference)." This short decade is China's "eventful autumn." The author uses the domestic politics, international situation, historical origins, public opinion, and personalities of this period as a background, using the most reliable and scientific "historical observation" to objectively and correctly depict the ups and downs of Chinese diplomacy, deeply and simply, and attract people to win. The book draws on a wide range of materials. For example, the issue of recognition by various countries and the issue of participating in the war have been said by predecessors who have not been said; the broad references are all based on reliable history. As for the rigor of the writing and the clarity of the footnotes, they are especially superfluous. If Mr. Jiang Tingfu is said to be the authority on the study of diplomacy in the Qing Dynasty, then Mr. Zhang Zhongfu should be the authority on the study of diplomatic history since the Republic of China. The publication of Mr. Zhang's book is indeed a deeply gratifying event for the academic community and the publishing community during the war in our country. I think that anyone who studies diplomatic history or international politics will have the same feeling after reading this book.</p>
<h3>Textbook Panic?</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter</p>
<p>Recently, many primary and secondary school students have said that they have searched all the bookstores but cannot buy textbooks. If they buy Chinese, they lack history; if they have arithmetic, they do not have geography. In order to understand the reasons for this, I visited seven bookstores, including Commercial Press, China, World, Zhengzhong, Datong, Kaiming, and Independent, in two days, which are the so-called "Seven Joint Supply Offices."</p>
<p>As the recovered areas gradually expand, the demand for textbooks is naturally increasing. The "Seven Joint Offices," the agency responsible for supplying textbooks for primary and secondary schools nationwide, has established an organization in Shanghai to supply the needs of the three provinces and two cities in the southeast. Later, Qingdao, Weifeng, and other places also came to Shanghai to purchase books, and for a time, it felt inadequate. However, summarizing the opinions of various companies, they all agreed that the panic situation was not very serious. Because this situation is only individual, not universal. It is possible that a few types or a few volumes are missing, or one company is missing, but another company has more. They believe that as long as they can be fully allocated newsprint, this situation will not occur in the next semester.</p>
<p>Now, under the guidance of the Bureau of Education, schools that cannot buy books can register with the Bureau of Education. The deadline is March 15, and distribution will begin on March 16. However, only 20 schools have registered, and the number is less than 10,000 books, which shows that the panic situation has passed.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the authorities will have thorough statistics and plans in the next semester, so that the textbook shortage panic will not recur this time.</p>
<h3>Books</h3>
<p>— Fei Wen</p>
<p>Bad books are like poisonous drinks; they can affect a person's body and spirit. — Edward</p>
<p>Good books are the guardians that protect humanity from doing bad things. The greatest danger in life is emptiness, which is like an empty house that can be invaded by bad things. If a person reads books, then their mind will never be empty. — Gelaotu (Likely a transliteration of a Western name)</p>
<p>The most beneficial books for us are not those that are most widely introduced, but rather those that are most suitable to our needs and that can quench our intellectual thirst. — Gan Ning</p>
<p>We should use books, not be used by them. We read books to understand life, not read books for the sake of life. — Bai Erfo (Likely a transliteration of a Western name)</p>
