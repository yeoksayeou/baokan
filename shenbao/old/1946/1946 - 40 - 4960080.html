<h3>魯省調處工作未竟濟南小組昨飛返平　共軍要求將在渝討論</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平八日電〕軍事調處執行部濟南小組，在魯調處工作吿一段落，今下午由濟飛返平，向執行部請示工作方針，週內將再赴濟南，繼續調處工作。</p>
<p>〔又電〕執行部濟南小組，於一月卅一日，二月二日兩度飛共黨魯省府所在地臨沂，與共黨（新四軍）陳參謀長士渠，軍長陳毅會談，陳士渠在會談時向雷克上校稱：接到停止作戰命令，自當堅次執行，惟尙未繳械之日僞軍，仍有進攻共軍之企圖，若依照和字第二號命令規定後退六十里，無異為日偽軍解圍，獎勵當漢奸，獎勵侵略者，此點希望執行部再加考慮。關於實行停戰命令，恢復交通問題，陳士渠又表示，自停戰命令發出後，魯省全境即入於停戰狀態，其未停者，乃為對日僞之衝突。自抗戰勝利後，僞軍已無存在之必要，故今日使僞軍放下武器，實為當前一切問題之先決條件，共軍有力解除日僞軍之武裝，亦有此種權利等語。於是日僞軍繳械問題，乃為臨沂會談之焦點，雷克上校在會談中，闡述本身立塲，非代表國民黨或共產黨任何一方，此行目的，唯在如何能使衝突停止，解除戰爭狀態。雷克並舉出法國。挪威等國家處理敵軍係在一切問題解次後辦理以為例證，希望國共雙方不咎旣往，相見以誠，各種問題自不難解次，第一次會談遂未得結論。二月六日在臨沂住一宿，會談結果，共黨方面提出六項要求，仍根據第一次會談之主張，小組認為無法解次，乃由陳士渠代表共軍來平，向北平執行部請示。總之，魯省共軍認為全省一零七縣，有十分之九在其攀握之中，政府僅保有濟南·靑烏兩地，形同孤島，故堅次主張魯省日軍應由彼繳械，以充實其兵刀。至於恢復交通問題，共黨則認為：魯省膠濟·津浦兩路在其掌握中，必須由彼擔任護衛管理之權，始准恢復。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶八日電〕據政府方面稱：中共新四軍已提出各項要求，使山東方面不能執行停戰協定要求中包括（一）取消濟南及徐州綏靖公署，（二）山東國軍重編，（三）當地日軍由共軍繳械，中共控制區械鐵路歸中共方面管理。北平軍事調處執行總部美國代表柏雷德少將現在此間，定今日與周恩來會晤，大抵將討論此項要求。</p>
<p>〔中央社鄭州八日電〕軍事調處執行部新鄉小組，七日舉行座談會，交換意見，共產黨代表要求，修武，獲嘉兩縣應劃歸共產軍，政府代表則提出，孟縣應由國軍進駐，成為爭執焦點。按修武，獲嘉兩縣係在停止衝突命令前為國軍所收復，孟縣係停止衝突命令後為共產軍所佔。</p>

<p>稍有能力逃奔避難</p>
<p>〔中央社北平八日電〕魯省共軍自停戰令下後，仍在其駐區內，實行其殘暴之行為，濟南靑島附近各縣，因不堪共軍之蹂躪摧殘，稍有逃走能力者，均逃奔濟靑避難，以日照一縣而論，逃往靑島者，即有二萬人。據張繼談，靑島登記之此等難民，已達廿萬人。據何思源談，濟南此等難民的十餘萬，各縣所謂土八路軍，其殘暴實難想像，且恐非共軍所能控制，各地公平人士，望協商會議後，共軍應與國軍合力剿匪之呼聲，實不失為一值得注意之問題。據一月廿七日靑島來人稱，共軍區城抽壯丁愈惡劣，改為由十三歲至四十五歲，而七十老嫗亦須站崗士紳孫聖與之家產及衣物器具，已被鬥爭乾淨，人仍覊押，其母年逾九旬，近亦已被游街坐台筐，亦為共軍酷刑之一，筐內置草荆，令坐其中，三步一頓，荆刺入股，痛不可忍，游行之後，令其上台自宣罪狀。楊漢臣戴白紙帽，綁背游街，孫樂昌曲禾生等千餘家，近均被鬥爭乾淨，被鬥爭之家門前掛燈，被拖去而死者時有所聞，近有水城村某處女被拖去，將兩乳磨掉。蓬萊城牆，近已拆完，城內劃為二十村，近命每村出秧歌一班，女踩高蹺，男打鑼鼓，</p>
<p>蓬萊古閣夷為平地</p>
<p>蓬萊閣為有宋以來之名勝，近亦拆平矣。又隨張宣慰使繼赴靑之崔唯吾秘書稱，其禹城家鄕，民不堪命，情形大致與蓬萊相同，彼之伯母年逾七旬，亦為共軍綁上疊桌，而置之高台，被迫宣佈其子經輩在外作事者之罪狀，家中食糧鬥爭乾凈，無以為生。</p>
<p>無家可歸良用浩歏</p>
<p>記者籍日照，家有薄田十餘畝，牲畜數頭，早被沒收，森林山場亦被鬥爭完了，抗戰勝利國土重光，而個人薄田亦被搶光，竟致無家可歸，言念及此，良用浩歎。據司鄉由靑來函所述家鄉共黨各種殘暴情形，與各地大同小異，其鬥爭方法，如勒令地主找補佃戶多年地租，迫業主尊稱傭人爲長輩，亦與冀魯等省無異，假使政府與共黨能照協商會議次議案切實施行，共軍整編軍隊成功，而其駐區內之社會秩序如何恢復，所謂土八路之殘忍行為如何糾正，實為當前亟應覓求解次之問題，吾則華北數省地方人士，將無噍類。</p>

<h3>國軍與分裂派不斷衝突　新疆局勢的輪廓　本報專稿　朱民威自新疆歸來後寄</h3>
<p>新疆省——這一個寒帶沙漠中豐饒而尙待開發的處女地——有四百萬人口，其中除漢族外，其他宗族如哈族，維族，蒙族等，紛然　處，數十年間並無顯著的衝突或鬥爭。最近一二年來，哈薩克族因刧奪的積習未除，再加上新的因素，曾一再掀動了沙漠中的戰亂，引起國內外人士一致的焦慮。但自我國民政府特派張治中將軍赴新談判以後，戰亂局面幸吿結束，此次哈薩克忽又藉口談判協定未獲我政府批准，向國軍重作挑　行為，此事頗堪注意。本文作者最近奉航空委員會政治部之會赴新公幹，甫於日前歸抵滬上，就共見聞所及，撰成專稿兩篇，陸續在本報發表，以饗讀者。（編者）</p>

<p>哈薩克騎兵隊掀動沙漠戰爭</p>
<p>這個戰爭是怎樣弄起來的？大家都說不出近因，若是一定要找出一點原因，那可以說是定住的經濟勢力與遊收的經濟勢力互相衝突的表現。到過西北的人，都知道大漠中有一支宗族，叫哈薩克，這是一種與蒙古族相近的遊收宗族，人數不多，根據地是外蒙古與新疆交界的阿爾泰山·在</p>
<p>哈薩克族過慣遊牧生活，居處時有不定，如蒙古人之居於「蒙古包」一樣，哈人則居於「哈薩克包」中。「包」之形式與構造均簡陋異常。泥土與草為其主要之材料。新疆提到阿山區的哈薩克，人人都知道，這名詞與刦奪擄掠的意義連在一起。這支以阿山為根據地的哈薩克宗族，有史以來一直在遊牧狀態裏漂流着，阿山區的一　山險境像是金城湯池似的保護着他們，阿山區以南準噶爾盆地以及天山以北的整個北疆，天然的就是他們的遊牧草原與擄掠區域。尤其是最近廿年來，阿山區的哈薩克北犯西侵不成。（西北均為蘇聯境界）只好永遠以兇眼對着南邊約定住宗族。以迪化為中心的北疆區城各宗族是以漢族與維吾兒族為主體的農耕商販地帶，於是哈族就以維漢兩族人做眼中釘。加以疆省軍政權幾十年來都一直在漢人手中，哈薩克作戰的第一個目標當然就成為「殺盡漢人」了。卅三年十月，正是新疆省政權發生替代的時期，統治新疆十五年的督辦盛世才剛剛於八月間調渝，素以深悉蒙藏邊情見稱的吳忠信氏來長省政，哈薩克感覺到這是一個機會，加以其他一些素，哈薩克騎兵隊就於卅三年十一月七日衝進了北疆西陲要鎭伊寗市區。</p>
<p>馬刀殺入伊寗守軍門志彌堅</p>
<p>伊寗是一個各族雜處的邊陲城市，人口超過八萬。維族與歸化一族（舊俄時代的俄人於蘇聯革命後進入新疆歸化我國者）最多。風習也就像哈爾濱新市區似的，有濃厚的俄國城市味兒。在這個地方，早於我國抗戰開始時，即由蘇聯於此協助我空軍從事訓練工作，故而有一座很大的空軍營房與幾座機場，在這次伊寗攻守戰中，這座位在阿林巴克（地名）的空軍軍營與耳　機場，就成了伊寗最激烈的作戰中心，戰鬥一直延綿了八十七天。這個新疆戰爭第一仗，打得眞是凶惡，雙方都是志在必勝，守軍失敗了，沒有活的理由，只有被哈薩克的馬刀砍掉。哈薩克是志在必得這個　饒的城，能不能把新疆的部份掌握在他們的手裏，這是一個關鍵。哈薩克由一萬增加到二萬，伊寗市區整個的逐漸落到他們手中，但是敎導隊軍營與機塲，始終在守軍手裏。</p>
<p>蘭州國軍西開風雪征程漫長</p>
<p>我政府當然不願讓這個要地失陷，但如果我們現在不健忘一年半以前的局勢，常然記起卅三年十一月正是桂柳失陷，日軍一日千里長驅直犯貴陽的時候。全中國的天地，像冬寒季節一般暗淡無光。朱紹良長官指揮了一支由蘭州開去的軍隊，日夜西行，但從星星峽到伊寗的風雪征途太漫長了，而空軍的空運機正在忙着由西安把湯恩伯部隊運到貴陽，去築一道緊急防綫，阻止日軍北犯陪都。。羅機空軍司令在拼命要到的幾架空運機里，親自去伊寗送械彈，送鹽已，送藥品，還送鍋魁（麵餅）。這種救援，無疑的支持了堅守部隊的心，可是力量都用盡了的時候，那些守軍，只有在死去時，還遺憾着失掉這顆縣在國門上的寶玉。從星星峽趕到迪化的李鐵軍部隊，只來得及在精河縣前面築一道防錢，防禦佔領伊寗的哈薩克騎兵東進。</p>
<p>可是由迪化經綏來烏蘇，去補給精河前綫，這一條相當於成都到萬縣的漫長道路，也確實够困難，這條補給綫，不僅是暴露在西北嚴冬的風雪裏，而且整個暴露在阿山區哈薩克騎兵隊的威脅下。因此，整個冬季，一直到卅四年五月，精河到迪化沿綫，不時有哈薩克騎兵隊小股的騷擾，而由蘭州來的陸軍官兵，由於補給困難，以及裝備不足以抵禦零下三十度的氷雪侵襲，不僅艱難的不能發動攻擊，而且僵死在戰壕裏或則凍斷手足。春天來了以後，由於太陽的活力，戰爭顯得活潑一點，但是由於力量對比的懸殊，哈薩克騎依然處處擊敗我方步兵。</p>
<p>由春天到現在，北疆半年來的軍事形勢，依然是不利的展現着，七月底，北疆另一邊陲要鎭塔城情况不明，塔城附近的額敏失守，苦守阿山區南麓承化城的宛師長，固然在死守着。但地面交通已斷，只有由天空運送彈藥等軍需品一條綫，而南疆一向是富庶太平的業園。八月十四日，南疆的拜城已失陷於渡過天山的哈薩克之手。（旋又於八月十九日由駐軍收復。）九月，迪化至精河綫上的要地烏蘇被阿山區街下來的哈薩克佔領，防禦的戰綫不能不重新佈置，以綏來為第一綫，形成了死守迪化的作戰姿態。這就是一年以來在新疆沙漠裏發生的戰爭之廓。</p>
<p>古典式當家人吳忠信的作風</p>
<p>六十二的老人吳忠信氏，一向是政府經常接觸邊政的人物，在中央更動新省政局時，這位老人被派來，他到新省之後有許多事在不聲不響中做了去，這是一個古典一點的當家人，他看，聰，本着他四十年來從政的原則與經騐處理新省政務。首先他釋放了關在省會迪化監獄中的幾千個政治犯，這些犯人有維族人，漢人，許多維族犯人都是在維族中居領導地位的，這一件事改善了政府與其治下各宗族之間的惡劣關係，一直到現在，新疆境內戰事僅只有遊收宗教哈薩克在閙，可以知道政治上的實施之重要，吳主席知道新疆過去都犯了人漢專權的毛病，所以有許多政府職位都儘量請各宗族中的幹才充任，如像省政府各應都設一個副　長，建設廳的副廳長是一位蒙古族人，迪化區行政專負是一位塔塔克族和德車留學生，很多縣的縣長是由維族人充任的。維族。塔旗·哈旗·在迪化合組了一個宣撫委員會，這個委員會經常在做對邊遠各族的宣慰工作。吳主席到省以後，有很多的宗族代表，紛紛由各地來迪化謁見，他覺得於少各宗族知道迪化新省政府可以親近，這就是能以與民更始的第一步已經做到。</p>
<p>各族的參議員羣集迪化談判</p>
<p>今年八月與九月，新省的臨時參議會召集了，我看到一汽車一汽車南疆維族參議員與新省其他各族參議員，紛紛集中迪化來。戰爭是一道鴻溝，把政府與哈薩克族的騎兵隊劃分在兩邊，但在整個省政推進上，吳主席處處地方顧慮到給各宗族以政治權力，給他們自由，給他們參與做新疆省主人。在八月間，甚至阿山區的哈薩克族四個首領中的一個自動來談判。政府的飛機飛到承化機塲降落，把他接到迪化來，澳主席這位老人是相信跟任何宗族可以把理性談得相通的，因此，在新疆的變亂中，他沒有宣傳什麼大道理，只是平庸的踏實的像理亂絲一般在心平氣和的整理着</p>
<p>一邊推行戰爭一邊推動建設</p>
<p>新疆雖然在戰爭中，但建設工作却緊緊的推行着，以應付政治的需要。毫無間題，新疆地表上的經齊現象，是遊牧與農業社會經濟並存着。新疆省政府的建設企圖是逐漸提高經濟結構與形態來達到新疆進步的目的。譬如由地面上的勞動到地層下的開發，由遊收發展到農耕，由農耕及小手工業到工業生產。計劃的政府建設，在新疆省確實比社會經濟自然發展，要有力量的多。</p>
<p>在目前新疆建設工作對於人民直接有利的，是水利，其次即為交通，倘若有一條鐵路，由蘭州通過來，新疆省內的交通連接了，人民移動以及貨物琉通，都可順利地解決，而目前除了不定期的航空以及汽車在聯繫內地與新疆之外，新疆事實上與內地等於隔絕了一樣，那情形，不比西藏外蒙古與內地之關係有什麼不同，因此余應長盼望隴海鐵路的西展終點，要越蘭州往西來，能接近新疆一點，總比距新疆遙遠一點的好。當然，由於資史的關係以及地理的接近，新疆在交通建設以及重要的礦產開發都需要取得蘇聯的協助，這是有待於外交方面打開的悶局。（二月五日）</p>

<h3>解決本市交通問題</h3>
<p>— 一民</p>
<p>改善行車規章　執行交通管制</p>
<p>抗戰勝利的前夕——民國三十三年至三十四年——在後方諸大城市中，如重慶昆明成都貴陽等地，因爲軍用汽車雲集，運輸量激增，均有行車秩序混亂的發生，及肇禍傷人的不幸事件。當時各地，以美軍車輛多，故運輸當局感覺美邦人士對於靠左行駛，或不習慣，擬改為靠右行駛，以謀矯正一切弱點。勝利之後，本市交通，亦發生同樣問題，於是在本年一月一日，當局乃毅然決然的，將全國各地行車，皆改為靠右行駛了。</p>
<p>現在實行這種制度，已有一個多朋的時間，在這一個月中，事實上得到了多少効果，改善了多少秩序，減少了多少死傷，想市政當局，必有調查與統計的數字是發生過多產次。一月卅一日報一載魏德邁將軍「因上海交通情形頗見紊亂擬往訪錢市畏商談補救辦法」，由此可見目前本市交通秩序，仍然未能充分的改進，致使友邦人士代我憂慮。所以我們自己似乎要來快快的解決自己的問題，要趕緊去作有效的處置。安定自己，便利他人。</p>
<p>交通之紊亂與減少肇禍傷人的辦法，可以大膽來說，不是靠右靠左所可解決的，基本的原則，是在乎行車之有規章，及行車之有管制。美邦人士在其本國駕駛車輛之時，對於美國的行車規章，是習知的，對於其行車管制，是遵守的。但到了中國各大城市，因為我們有的地方是沒有規章的，有的地方雖然有行車規章而沒有管制方法的。如此，因為我們自己根本沒有了秩序，所以他邦人士在這種環境之下，也就無所適從，也就會因此藐視的及大膽的橫衝直撞，引起了很多不幸的事件限購來，使我們無法加以製裁。不過我們應當附帶聲明的，是美邦人士，每每因酗酒之後，駕駛汽車而肇禍，這是要單獨的負其責任。所以本市要改善交通這兩方面去探討，才能解決整個的問題。要自究的，是先問：我們自己有沒有究善的行車規章？自已行車是不是依照了這規章去管制？再問：我們對於行車管制的各種設備及辦法，有沒有改良的需要？對於這些問題，可以大槪來講，是要從多方面去研究的。第一是我們的交通量，要能適合我們街道的寬度。第二是我們的街道，要有分類的性質，才能疏導我們行車之擁擠。第三是我們的紅綠燈，在功用上要能適合實際的需要，才能避免紊亂危險之發生。第四是我們的車輛，在無乘客之際，其停留的地方與時間，要不影響及阻碍行駛車輛之來往。第五是路上的行人，要利用人行道的功用，不能隨意的在街心來往，才能免少傷亡的危險。第六是我們如何去執行管制這些不遵規章的行動，俾慢慢能引導他們入於常規之中。第七是我們如何能蔣汽車三輪車黃包車及脚踏車，使之分道行駛，俾能互不相擾，而免互撞之機會。第八是我們如何去修改我們的行車規章，如何改良我們管制的設備，同時如何使本市數百萬人能明瞭此種規章而知遵守的義務這些問題，並不是一言兩語所能說完，這必須要就各方面去從長計議與計劃的</p>
<p>我覺得在整個計劃未決定之前，目前須要急於執行的，的有五種事項如下：</p>
<p>（一）全市街道，應根據其各自的行車數量及其行車的方向，從新　定有交通性的街道系統。例如重要的街道，應當規定為直通幹這（Thoroughfare），與其相接通的不重要街道，可以規定為單行街道（One　way　street）或停車街通（Stop　street）。在各種街道之上，應劃出一定之停車地位，所有各種車輛，不能隨意在街上停留。</p>
<p>（二）重要街道十字路口之紅綠燈，應改設定時號誌（Elxed-TimeSignal）。並須能顯示該處左轉右轉及倒轉之禁止或准許，俾可省去管制紅綠燈之警士，另為巡察及管制之工作，而增加紅綠燈之功用。不重要之十字路口，則可加設閃光號誌（FlashingSingnal），指揮行與行人。　（三）在警察方面，應添設交通警察之制度，並須訓練交通警士，授以近代交通管理之學識。必要時在警察局更可設立交通法處（Traffic　Court），以執行擾亂行車秩序者之處罰，並可分析行車肇禍之原因，而可證明肇禍之責任誰屬。</p>
<p>（四）行人要使其充分能利用人行道，不得在街心行走，更不准隨意在任何地方穿過馬路。行人欲穿過馬路者，必須在規定之地方穿過之，以免危險。關於此點不僅需要交通警士之指導，更須設法使民衆感覺此種行動之需要。</p>
<p>（五）多設標語，多事宣傳，俾使一般中外民衆，對於交通秩序，對於交通規章，能有深切之認識，才能有遵守一切的自動行為，然後可以减少不幸的事件。</p>
<p>上海是全國最大的城市，交通秩序的維持，是一個很要緊很需要的行政。大凡一個城市的市政好壞，就看他的行車秩序，也就可以看出一二了。交通規章與交通管制，是一個專門學術，上海要解決目前的交通問題，毫無疑問的要從這兩方面人手，決非僅恃執行靠右或靠左所可轉移的。可歎！全中國並無一個城市，有良善的交通秩序，走盡各城市中，其交通情形，全是紊亂的！所以希望上海市能奠定我國交通管理的基礎，能作為全國各城市交通管理事業的模範，更能因此而解決了目前盟邦人士與我國民衆因行車肇禍的誤會，而可合理的分析出來究竟此種肇禍的責任是誰屬了。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>光明氛圍中的烏雲</h3>
<p>本報昨日北平專電，謂東北局勢週來已益見複雜，據可靠方面消息，一名為「東蒙自治政府」之機構，已於一月十五日在前僞滿興安南省省會之王爺廟成立，並在其國民大會中宣布「東蒙共和國」之獨立。政府主席烏爾占，為一籍隸蘇聯之布里雅特蒙古將軍。此項消息，因交通遲滯，昨日始到達此間。據悉，所謂東蒙紫指卓累圖與哲里木兩盟，其地區包括東北之與安·遼北·與熱河三省之大部，新成立之「東蒙自治政府，」已定國旗為紅旗，上嵌黃色之鑛刀與收鞭各一，表示其為農牧國家。法國新聞社昨亦有類似報道。同日聯合社重慶電，據私人方面所接新疆消息，國軍與新疆分裂派又起衝突，衝突起因由於中央方面未批准蔣主席特使張治中與分裂派代表三人所簽訂之協定。分裂份子大抵為土爾基人，全境號稱「東土爾基斯坦共和邦，」首都設伊寗。上面這兩則消息，一則來自東北，一則來自西北，當舉國因政協會議圓滿閉幕而引起的一片祥和空氣中，此項消息的傳來，誠不免令人引為憾事。此項消息雖尙有待於證實及其後的發展，但大抵為一種有根據的報道。凡此所傳，在逐漸明朗化的政治睛空上，不免又見一朶朶的烏雲。</p>
<p>東北局勢自敵寇投降以來，在過去的五月中，時而明朗，時而陰暗，眞彷彿有點像週期性的瘧疾，此項局勢一直延展到今日，並未有大改進。據本報重慶七日電，蘇軍原定本月初可自東北撇退，今又延滯，現各主要接收人絡繹來渝請示，皆行動機密，守口如瓶。而他方面消息，亦說東北工礦接收暫停，各專家只好留在華北工作。我派往東北的接收人員，對東北局勢旣多守口如瓶，專家們對東北又可望而不可即。一般輿論，對東北局勢亦多未有所論列。，若干人士，特別是我們報人，對東北局勢，更只許從陰暗方面看到明朗的一面力加煊染，圖於煊染之中可以自我陶醉。凡此所為，眞有萬分說不出的苦衷。不過，在東北局勢僵持了逾五月之久的今日，而且在過去五月中又絡繹地展開着新局勢，我們如還不能於容忍緘默之中的略有所吐露，我們眞自慚再為報人，也實在太對不起國人了。</p>
<p>為什麼對東北局勢我們需要容忍緘默？這就是由於我們十分珍視中蘇間的睦誼。我們因為信任蘇聯必將實踐共諾言，並尊重中蘇間友好的條約關係，所以雖然在「言論自由」的基本權利下，我們總朝光明處看，寗願容忍緘默。然而這五個月來東北局勢的展開，却不能不令我們深深焦盧。接防東北的國軍，不能利用東北的海口，而須由秦皇島循鐵道錢推進，到今日還沒有進入那使中國人永遠不會遺忘的瀋陽城！自遼東半島經越東北偉大的平原以迄中蘇兩國的邊界，據說還有各該地的所謂「人民軍隊」！在這一串不愉快的消息之後，最近又傳來了所謂一東蒙自治政府」突吿出現的消息！</p>
<p>主持「東蒙自治政府」的首腦，傳係一籍隸蘇聯之布里雅特蒙古人，曾畢業蘇聯紅軍大學，在紅軍中得有將軍頭銜。查布里雅特蒙古人的居地在貝加爾湖一帶，與在東北的內蒙人雖同為蒙古人，但究非當地土著，且又為紅軍中得有將軍頭銜者，是此項所謂「自治」運動，眞相如何，大有疑問。而且關於東北地方之協定，係由中國國民政府與蘇聯政府所打立，在國民政府權力未曾到達東北以前，蘇聯當局負有將整個東北移交給國民政府接管之條約義務，則在其防區以內，產生及發展與中國國民政府利益牴觸的任何局勢，蘇聯理難放任不顧，故此種所謂「東蒙自治」運動，即使是當地人民的一種自發運動，我們相信負有維持秩序之責的蘇聯軍隊也會予以制止。吾則這分化中國邊疆的情態，豈不要使那一朶烏雲逐漸掩蔽了光明？</p>
<p>同樣的分化運動，又出現在與東北的「蒙疆」相距有遼遠路程的西北。在新疆的西陲，也出現了所謂「東土爾基斯坦共和國」。中央亞西亞的「突厥共和國」原為蘇聯的地部，今日在新疆出現的「東土爾基斯坦共和國」與「突厥共和國」有什麼關連，我們不知道，也不願有所推斷。蘇職在中央亞西亞還有「哈薩克共和國」，，「大食共和國」，而在我們的新疆也有哈薩克人，「大食」人，假如這樣的分裂原則可被承認，則我們將不復再有新疆的了！外蒙成立了「人民共和國」最近離開我們了，「唐努烏梁海人民共和國」，也早經離開我們而加人了蘇聯的版圖。今日在東北有「東蒙共和國」，在西北又有「東土爾基斯坦共和國」，它們將來怎麼樣呢，只有將來的歷史可以證明。眞湊巧，我們遙遠的看見伊朗的亞塞而拜然自治運動，伊拉克的寇迪許自治運動，異曲同工，可歎觀止。我們為了要保持我們領土的完整，主權的完整，不惜與日本作了長期的抗戰，今勝利在握，而呈現在我們眼前的局勢，是這麼一張蠶食開端的地圖，誠令我們愧為「大國」！</p>
<p>中蘇兩國壞地相接，自太平洋的西岸經烏蘇里河，黑龍江，越朔漠阿爾泰，以至帕米爾高原，其間國界的綿長，世無其匹。蘇聯酷望和平，中國人民尤愛和平。昨天蘇聯人民外交委員長莫洛托夫的演說，稱「蘇聯為全世界之和平計，永遠準備與愛好和平之大小國家，保持友善合作」。中國政府及人民，對此萬分同感。美國前副總統華萊士於年前來華時曾說，中蘇兩國邊界之長，惟美國與與加拿大之邊界堪與比擬，希望中蘇邊界與美加邊界一樣足以增進兩國間的了解和合作。我們也眞願這綿長的國界確能做到像美加間的國界一樣，永遠不必有戒備。出現在東北的「東蒙共和國」，與新疆的「東土爾基斯坦共和國」，我們固然相信其中不會有蘇聯的支持作用，然前者出現於蘇聯軍占領區內，後者出現於與蘇聯國境密邇相接的地區，終究不免為光明氛圍中的烏雲。中國需要和平，但亦需要安全。中國需要民主，但亦需要統一。和平安全，民主統一，却要有一個完整的中國。</p>

<h3>遣送東北日人返國　美軍同樣負責　魏德邁將軍答記者問</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美軍中國戰區總司令魏德邁將軍，昨日上午十一時，在建設大樓招待中外記者。對於東北各項問題，均有祥細答覆。魏氏並稱：預料中國軍隊進入東北約一月時間。</p>
<p>出席之記者問：東三省日軍是否亦由美方處置？魏將軍稱，美國在東北亦有遺送日人回國之責任，對於運輸工具等亦同樣供給。在緯度十六度以北，如海南島·台灣等·帶，均有美國之帮助。自日本投降，至美總統潑表對遠東政策期內，日軍民由美方遺送者共二萬五千人，現已進展至三十六萬人。同時美軍部以官方正當手續，調查在東北之日軍情形，以作執行任務之基礎。但在遺送方面，最主要者爲交通工具及糧食問題，此點須視中國方面是否有支配交通工具，及糧食之能力。並希望在一月內可獲解決。</p>
<p>蘇軍撤退未獲消息</p>
<p>關於新聞記者至東北工作一點，魏將軍本人認爲如每國記者均能在東北，將事實充分報道，乃一極佳之事。但目前渠尙未得任何答覆，同時亦不便推行此事。又蘇俄軍隊在東北撤退事，亦未獲消息。美軍部目前正忙於運輸新六軍，遺送日人等工作，無暇顧及其他次要各事。但關於日軍情形之官方情報，正在進行獲得中。外傳有東三省日本軍民撤至蘇聯境內事，毫無所悉。</p>
<p>竭力減少在華美軍</p>
<p>有詢以美軍在今後三月中接防人員來華人數與日期，及聞約有四千五百美軍回國事者，魏將軍對此類未經確定之報道，深感困難。略謂：余在過去曾報吿「或許」將有四千左右美軍返國，但並未稱「一定」。美軍家屬得不確定之報道後，時有來信探問者，致不但使余處事困難，且使華盛頓軍部不便。余現作一概括答覆，即余將竭力减少在華各方美軍，僅求一足够人數，以執行工作。凡得高積點之人員，自當按預定辦法回國。</p>
<p>美顧問團協助建軍</p>
<p>美在華軍事顧問團至今尙未成立，如成立，則其職務全在協助中國建立海陸空軍。但服務人負全係志願者，固然其中一小部份人，須有在此服務經騐者以作指導。若顧問團成立，則海軍與陸軍將分別組成，但兩方面主管人，同時與蔣委員長合作，以利工作之進行。</p>
<p>外傳美陸軍將全部撤退，由海軍執行一切任務，魏將軍稱並無此說。如軍事顧問團成立，則陸軍人員須較海軍更多，且更重要。此種傳說或係因柯克上將赴渝而引起。實則此次柯克上將謁見蔣委員長，純係拜訪性質，海陸兩軍次無妬忌之意。</p>
<p>戰事結束恢復官階</p>
<p>美軍長官現均有减低官階之舉，魏將軍稱多數長官均在戰時升級，現戰事結束，即回復以前階級。余接獲來自華府之名單，指明某人於某時應回復以前階級而執行之。但亦有若干長官，並不减級者。</p>
<p>有記者詢以此次在日本，捕獲有關殺害杜立德將軍所屬飛行員三人之日戰犯二人，一已解　，一仍留日本，何時亦可來華。魏將軍謂，不便答覆何以留其在日之原因。麥克阿瑟將軍與余合作甚力，如麥將軍以爲應留此另一戰犯在日，則必有其理由，余認爲此舉頗爲合理。</p>

<h3>訪問左舜生</h3>
<p>— 蒼龍</p>
<p>「我個人平素的主張是國家的利益第一，人民的利益第二，國際共同的利益第三，黨派的利益第四，不要過份强調黨派的利益，這是沒意義的事。……」</p>
<p>穿的是一襲藍布大掛，布質的暖鞋，頭髮上沒油蠟的滋潤，長而圓的臉龐，帶着七分嚴肅相的左舜生先生儀表上所給我的影像，是一個中國平民，記者伸過手去握了握手之後，說明了來意，劈頭就提出要他發抒些政見的話，他沉毅的臉上，泛現了幾絲笑痕，沉默了二陣子，終於說了。</p>
<p>「關於政治協商會，這次我並未參加，但對經過的情形很詳細，現在會議也已經有了結果，憲草審議會也已定本月十四日召開第一次會議」。</p>
<p>「今年五月五日召開國民大會，制憲和行憲的步驟將劃分開來，道次召開國民大會後，下次的國民大會如何召開，那要看這次的憲草怎樣規定」。</p>
<p>「照我所曉得的，這次憲草，各方面已經有長時間的研究和交換意見，以前有憲政協進會，憲政實施協進會，這兩個會都是由政府召集的，我都參加過，各方面也都交換過意見」。</p>
<p>「這次政治協商會又討論憲草，經交換意見後，已經通過了幾個原則，現在正待召開的憲草審議會，就是根據這些通過的原則，做進一步的商討，我想信這次的審議會，很快就會有結果的，所以就實現民主，實施憲政而講，我認爲相當的樂觀」。他燃上了一根紙烟，吸了兩口，充份顯露着確具把握的神情。</p>
<p>「大致從通過憲法到根據憲法誕生的政府組成爲止，這某聞的過渡時期，還不會太短，我想政府改組完成，如各方面都能精誠團結，同時對民主推進，能够表顯成績，那末和平統一，是很有希望的，不致再會有內戰」。</p>
<p>「我很承認，國民黨，共產黨，靑年黨，民主同盟各黨，都有共同的認識，那就是一定要團結，統一，民主，和平～各黨共同的認識旣是一樣，那末，政府改組後，各方面也有相當圓滿的結果。」他對這方面的意見，顯得已吿了一個小段落，他的話鋒旋即轉移到軍隊國家化一點上去。</p>
<p>「關於軍隊國家化的問題，各方面都很注意，國際的朋友，對此也很重視，並且很熱心地帮忙，對於這問題，中共跟其他黨的認識一樣，那就是說，中國須要大量的裁兵，因爲本年度國家的總預算，軍費的支出幾幾乎佔了一半，假使不是大規模的整編和减縮，則對國家的建設和財政，都將遭遇困難，所以對這個問題，希望中共能够實踐諾言，暫時將軍隊縮編爲二十個師，那末，不難初步解決達到軍隊國家化的目的」。</p>
<p>最後左先生以沉重而爽辣的口吻來結束他的一篇談話，他說：「這次政府改組，國民大會的召開，各方面名額怎樣分配，只要大家把國家的利益和人民的利益看得很重，國際的環境認識得很淸楚，那末，這些問題都不難迎刃而解……」。接着，他發表了他平素對國家人民黨派利益先後的主張。</p>
<p>臨別時，他吿訴我他正在籌備出一張中華時報，大的遲至三月後可以出版，他本人在一個月內，可能到南京。天津·北平等地方視察一次，預備把失了八年聯繫的各地靑年黨黨部，整頓聯絡一下。</p>

<h3>大戶軋空銀樓扒吸　金價扶搖直上　一度出十三萬大關</h3>
<p>烚赤昨初以陪都金鈔報低，初時見疲，惟樂中大戶重施軋空故按，北幫及銀樓業扒吸殊猛，浮空顯感恐慌，低後突起軋空風潮，買風在大戶領導下猛烈展開，晨開即退爲一一九萬，銀行方面繼續供售，盤跌至一一六萬以下，銀樓趁低吸納，得以維持，業中大戶見有機可乘，聯絡各方，趁勢哄抬，漲勢一起，一轉瞬間重又穿出一二〇萬大關，此後一度自一二三萬外退爲一一九萬七，無如軋空勢成，北幫力購下，午前再昇至一二七萬以上而後稍回，午收一二四萬六，較前收續升二萬六，午後現貨一度自一二六萬五稍挫至一二四萬左右，迨後隔日交割交易漸漸拉上，因蘇軍延緩退出東北，引起種種助買傳說，人心奇挺，業中人紛起爭購，自一二六萬五步挺至一三二二萬左右，最後在一三〇萬大關盤旋，飾金掛高至十四萬元，紋銀一千二，銀元七三〇元，暗拆因銀根緊而稍高，的一角二分至一角四分。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔初開一六八〇元，後隨金市而稍退至一六五〇元，迨金價重俏，套買紛起，升至一七六〇元，午刻在一七三〇元左右徘徊，午後升至一七八〇元，最後一七七〇元，套頭拔開至七三〇以上，此乃缺少投機活動，完全被動有以致之，港票平後稍堅，結果老貨回升十元，新貨二元。</p>
<h3>逢高雖有出籠　股票漲勢仍銳</h3>
<p>華股昨繼續邁步前進，氣勢浩大，永紗晨開二五五〇元，此後自二七三〇元盤小至二六六〇元，午前復步高至二八二〇元，終以高價引起出籠，午刻退爲二七三〇元，樹大招風，高價遂難持久，美亞自一八五〇元漲到二一七〇元，午收二一〇〇元，景福未能越過一四元關，結果較一收計永紗升一七〇元，美亞一五〇元，信和一二〇元，三小熟漲九元至十二元，惟冷門各股漲勢亦極犀利。</p>
<p>外股漲高後引起老多頭傾售，證券幫中大戶迫於銀根，自顧不暇，不得不停止拉抬，以致各股都自高價回小半成，怡紗最高六九〇〇元，會德豐一六五〇〇元，英聯九千元，紛紛回跌，午收較前日計怡紗會德怡啤英聯等熱門各漲達一成半至二成左右，但賣盤居多。</p>
<h3>債市平穩</h3>
<p>公債丙種初平後堅，但大戶漸漸顧而之他，過程不若金股之生色，丙種以外，雜牌高價更感難以持久，最高見二三七〇元，最低二一四〇元，午收二二七〇元，較前收計甲乙漲六〇元，丙五〇元，丁一〇〇元，戊三〇元，差價稍稍軋近。</p>
<h3>米價飛漲</h3>
<p>米情以赤金上升不已，售主甚堅，且內地步昻，價格續升，粳米再加六七百元，羊秈白元狂升千元，麵粉去化活潑，績漲四百元，油市則供不應求，飛騰四千餘元，黃豆亦加三五百元不一，惟生仁則尙少出入，豆餅帶堅二三百元，</p>
<h3>紗市求過於供　各牌俱創新價</h3>
<p>昨日紗市益見堅昂，因織廠陸續復工，原料需求孔亟，同行手貨堅執不放，蓋同業中人上二日在紡建公司所開進之貨，均不能饜足其吸胃，市上乃呈求過於供之現象，廿支中小型紗哄抬尤烈，如醒獅飛馬等牌俱已做到七十二萬，較上日漲六萬之巨，廿支藍鳳見交七十八萬，亦升四萬，其餘粗紗綫無不上騰，形勢異常緊急，各牌俱創新高價，紡建開價，廿支以下，與前日相仿，惟細紗又提高。</p>
<h3>現棉廠需仍暢</h3>
<p>昨日現棉交易仍暢，市况賡續堅挺，蓋以廠家需要殷切，仍推細絨花占多數，美棉米得林送廠做七萬八至八萬元，火機花棧交做五萬三至五萬五千，各較前升二三千元云。</p>
<h3>呢羢紅盤猛漲</h3>
<p>呢羢紅盤，昨日同業各號大半均相繼開出，因有種種環境關係，兼因去臘收盤價高俏，莫不全部猛漲，尤以夏令貨派立司·羽紗呢·萬列鼎·元藏嗶嘰·華達呢·淺灰薄花呢等爲最，其西服裏襯類之法西襯黑炭襯·花洋布袖裏綢·絲光羽紗軟襯等，紅盤開價亦較過去爲高，祗大衣呢馬褲呢，駝斯錦長毛羢等過時貨，喊開較爲便宜云，</p>
<h3>煙煤屑步升　傳到貨在車站被扣　平賣煤明日起開始</h3>
<p>烟煤屑初開，廠方進胃即漸漸開展，均感市上實貨不敷，故價格甚爲緊俏，後又聞同業前向蚌埠南京等地採購大宗煙煤屑約三四十車，現雖到滬，但在滬麥根路車站被暫扣，原因不詳，致市塲遂起騷動，喊價步漲，白煤屑。手搖煤球製造業搜羅仍殷，而市上貨缺，行情續挺，白煤塊頹勢難挽，白煤小子零銷尙健，售價穩定。</p>
<p>又訊，經濟部上海區燃料管理委員會，爲籌辦市民炊事用煤配給事宜，曾飭煤業與煤球兩業公會組織「民生煤管理處」，其首批平賣，定明（十日）起，以徐家匯區爲開始，規定每戶持有三十四年十二月份電燈賬單購取山西無烟中小塊煤五十斤，每市斤售四十元，平賣處：（一）拉都路四八九號，（二）台斯德朗路二二四號，（三）賈西義路一號三處云。</p>
<h3>棉布漲起三成　紡建出價亦增高</h3>
<p>民營染織廠於新春休假後，對於工廠設備大致悉已籌措就緒，唯以坯布市存異常薄弱，滿望中國紡織建設公司於已登記會員廠商有普遍開售棉布，俾費生產，但中國紡建公司邇來對棉布雖有少量漂布灰光斜元光斜等開售，其價較市爲高，因之連日市塲布價較舊歲已增三成之譜，故中國紡建公司於坏布若再遷延不開，不特刺激布價上升，影響廠商，抑且關於工人生活，據聞染織業公會擬向該公司申請迅予開售坯布云。</p>
<p>又訊，中國紡織建設公司昨開出光斜及漂布，茲探錄布價如下，元光斜三萬元，灰光斜二萬八千，駝灰斜二萬八千，漂布五萬一千，漂布開價較之市塲同等貨品約高一成有奇。</p>
<h3>五金交易漸活</h3>
<p>五金業自六日開市以來，本街廠家購買逐漸活潑，如黑鐵皮拉絲洋元等貨，皆有成交，行情較上月底好起二成左右，至於客路　　則尙有所待。</p>

<h3>首都校舍近訊　各級學校多未就原址復課</h3>
<p>〔本報南京專訊〕抗戰勝利後，敎育之建設復興，爲當務之急。首都教育，因抗戰損失，恢復固賴經費，而校舍亦爲先決問題。茲將各級學校校舍情形，略述於下：</p>
<p>高等教育</p>
<p>關於高等敎育之專科以上學校校舍：（一）南京冬瓜市之金陵女子文理學院，因在戰時，爲南京市民難民區，收容許多難民，尤其是女子，當敵寇入京暴行之際，賴該院留京西敎授之助，保護許多女子貞潔，雖住難民，事後房屋幸得保存，該校現辦附中，暑後大學可復。（二）鼓樓金陵大學校舍，現爲臨大補習班借用，暑期臨大補習屆滿歸還，暑後金大亦可復校。（三）成賢街四牌樓中央大學，已從軍政機關收回本部房屋之一部，對於三牌樓中大農學院之房舍，現正在接洽商讓中，不久即可收回，目前臨大先修班，借中大之體育館爲辦事上課少用，該班暑期完畢，中大亦在暑後復校。</p>
<p>中等教育</p>
<p>私立學校校舍，如鍾英，育羣，匯文，明德，冶城，金陵，中華女中，等校未毀。安豐，東方，毀其一部。鍾南，毀其大部。市立學校，如南門外粥廠之市立師範校舍全毀，紫竹林之二中校舍拆毀，因此各校有為臨時權宜之計，多借校舍上課者。如市立一中，改設在白下路，（原來府西街之房屋，接洽收回，不久可回原校，所有白下路房屋，為首都地方法院辦公），同時將分校設在前昇平橋小學內，（正始中學改併）。二中借用鼓樓小學。三中職校，借昇州路衛斯理堂上課。市女中，設在許家巷前督糧廳小學內。至於國立臨時中學三校，則分設於龍蟠里，三茅宮，竺橋；第二臨中分部，則設於戰前門帘橋南京中學之實騐小學內。又私立新設之石城中學，則設於估衣廊城中會堂中。</p>
<p>初等教育</p>
<p>市立小學校舍，如高井，漢西門，南昌路，崔八巷，倉頂，船板巷，安品街，馬路街，淮淸橋，遊府西街，香舖營，中央路，新菜市，裴家橋，興中路等小學校舍，或全部毀滅，或損其大部。逸仙橋小學，爲兒童救濟院應用。此外如燕子磯，孝陵衛，漢中路，姬家莊，滄波門，信府洱，太平鄉，八卦洲等小學，及馬羣仙鶴門兩分校之校舍，皆以廟宇善堂利用。又楊將軍巷，三條巷，慧圓街等小學校舍，係借其他機關或私人之房舍。其完全租民房老，有八府塘，顏料坊，馬道街，雨花路，玄武門，胭脂巷，二條巷，鳴羊街，義倉巷，鳳凰街，雙閘，二板橋，高崗里，七里洲，馬羣，仙鶴門，程善坊，邊營，船板巷，邁皋橋，荷花塘，莫愁湖等小學校舍。又鄧府巷，評事街，金彎巷，三牌樓等小學校舍，前爲其他機關借用，可陸續收回辦學。至市校借用敎會會堂辦學者，因敎會須收回自用，已商定期限，由市歸還。大致在暑假以前，所有校舍問題，可全體解決云。（愚）</p>
<h3>市教育局指示私校方針</h3>
<p>〔大公社訊〕市敎育局昨日下午召開私立小學校長談話，計到開明，正本，啓智等校長二十人，即席由該局朱處長指示私校方針，計十五要點：（一）未立案者應從速立案，（二）組織校董會，（三）校長敎職員必須專任，（四）注意師資，（五）提高敎職待遇，（六）經濟公開，應組經濟核算委員會，（七）淸寒學生免費，（八）校務會議隨時改進，（九）簿册須經整理，（十）課程照標準進行，（十一）改進敎學方法，（十二）灌輸民族意義，在紀念週及公民訓練時實行，（十三）特別注意體格訓練，（十四）必須研究學校環境好惡，（十五）舉辦體育器具。旋由各校長報吿各該校近况，大部限於經濟困難，均希望敎局予以補助。</p>

<p>〔中央社訊〕昨晨九時，本市小學敎師千餘人，由靈寳路磬石小學齊集出發，赴馬當路市敎育局請願，要求敎育當局勒令之江小學校長，立即將七位被解職敎師復職，並勒令申江小學校長戈友仁，立即復校。常由敎局朱處長接見，答以對申江小學復校問題，已予勒令照辦，惟對之江小學被解職敎師復職一節，僅允考慮後答復。該代表等以本學期開學在即，不容延宕，且之江小敎不能復職，即全市小敎職業無保障，乃加派代表三十人，要求先行復職，再予調查。當局以此事須經調處，乃允許於今日午後二時答覆，千餘小學敎師，始魚貫退出。</p>

<h3>教育領導政治</h3>
<p>— 楊同方</p>
<p>最近在「平論」上讀到林漢的敎育思想，政治走那條路呢？達先生的「敎育是不是政治的尾巴」，覺得所論中肯，是値得注意的一篇文章。教育和政治本來互相關驟，不熊把牠們分開。敎育的理想，惟有靠政治的力量才能實現出來；而政治的推進，也惟有靠教育的力量才能見到實效。柏拉國在他的「理想國」中强調敎育與政治兩者之間的關係，當時希臘的許多敎育家差不多都是實際從政的人，而政治上所表現的又吻合那時代的敎育思想。又有許多學者，把敎育包括到政治裏去，認為政治本身就是教育。政是人民的事，治是管理，管理人民的事便是政治。進步一點說，政治含有領導指示的意思，把敎育的意義　統於政治之下，並不是忽視了敎育，到是擴大了敎育的涵義。</p>
<p>但是有許多人對於這兩方面發生誤解，以爲敎育本來是毫無一力量的，政治決定了一切的敎育作用。他們的錯誤在忽視了敎育的意義，以致使人對敎育的信念根本發生動搖。他們覺得政治有無限的力量，又看到許多的國家，敎育早巳失去決定作用，簡直跟了政治走。像過去德日意三大侵略國的敎育，處處表現出極濃厚的法西斯政治色彩。他們的敎育如果離開法西斯統治的政治觀念，根本就沒有其他的意義可言。的確，敎育在某種情形之下，是常被野心的政治家所利用的，因爲在極卑劣的政治外面，加上一件迎人的敎育的外衣，便可以到處欺騙人家了。敎育爲一種文花形態，她常常被人視爲「政治的幌子」，明明是一種法西斯的侵略文化，一般野心的政治家可以加上「軍國民敎育」動聽的字樣。說政治決定一切敎育的作用，看來好像也有理由。</p>
<p>再從事實方面來說，政治的力量畢竟是超過教育的。有時缺少政治的力量，教育簡直成了一紙空文。近代歐美　先進國，他們的教育實施，就很靠政治的力量。他們的憲法中規定了教育實施的目標和理想，他們的政治也反映了他們敎育的目標和理想。即如這種情形，我們只能說敎育和政治有緊密的關聯，或者更澈底地說，他們的政治已經貫澈了他們的敎育思想；而絕對不能說他們的敎育跟着政治走。就拿美國國來說，他們的政治，是進步的「民有，民享，民治」的民主政治，而他們的這種民主思想却胚胎於敎育。誠如克柏屈敎授所言：「良好的政治，一定是正確的敎育思想實施的結果，沒有正確」驟然看來，這話好像是替敎育辯護的，其實並不盡然。敎育代表一種政治的中心思想。失去一種中心思想的領導，政治必然是盲目的。</p>
<p>現在侵略國已新被爲維護世界和舉而抗戰的聯合國擊敗了。在公理戰勝强權，正義戰勝覇道的今日，我們再不希望人們再誤解敎育的作用了，敎育應該以正確的中心思想，領導政治向前走，政治才有辦法，國家才有辦法。當然，在某種意義下，我們也不能不承認政洽有她的力量，然而，我們可以斷言：政治的與正一力量，一定要在能够反映敎育思想表現敎育思想的條件下才能發揮出來。</p>
<p>目前要求實施憲政，實施民主政治的呼聲，震撼了全國。我們首先望大家要認淸敎育的意義，把眞正的民主敎育的思想建立起來，把眞正的民主敎育的目的貫澈起來。民主政治決不利用敎育做牠的幌十，民主政治一定接受進步的敎育思想做牠理論的基礎。敎育上的民主思想應該是政治上的民主精神的最高領導，而政治上的民主精神又全是敎育上的民主思想的反映，這樣敎育和政治互爲關聯，民主國家的建造也可以奠定鞏固的基礎。</p>
<p>眞正的敎育家必定是有理智的思想家，頭腦清醒的實踐者，如果從事政治的人能夠把握其思想的核心，使之反映於政治，表現於政治，也就不啻給理論和實踐之間建築一座溝通的橋梁。</p>
<p>教育決不是政治的附庸，教育育不是政治的尾巴，敎育確具有領導政治的偉大作用。至於爲什麼敎育要靠政治的力量才能發生顯著的效果，那我們要認淸這全是一種手段，一種方法。敎育的目的，敎育的理想無疑地還在敎育的本身。無論怎樣，教育是應該領導政治的。</p>

<h3>工潮記趣</h3>
<p>— 毛樹奎</p>
<p>電力公司全體職工二千八百餘人，自開始怠工之日起，咸集居於楊樹浦發電廠。一月卅一日下午四時許，突發現「索夫團」百數十人，前往索取「丈夫」回家，內中婦女的占十分之一，問其所索「丈夫」的姓名，都瞠目不知所對，但說「要問組長」。</p>
<p>當本市理髮業工潮蔓延之始，西區茶理髮店仍照常營業，後被工會巡察隊偵悉，乃糾集工友數十人，衝入該店，邀其參加怠工，瞬時即將所有職工一哄擁走，其時正當賓客滿座，見來勢不妙，盡皆蓬首散髮，奪門而出，有一女郞，燙髮未畢，滿頭靑絲，猶吊於電機中，急切不能掙脫，又怕觸電，不敢胡亂卸動，一時又窘又急，竟大呼救命，迨店主回來放時，頭髮已　焦過半。</p>
<p>此次工潮之發生，類多勞方向資方要錢，唯獨粵菜業職工反要求資方不向勞方要錢。原因是酒菜　職工一向無甚薪津，單靠小賬及外賞，因小賬收入相當豐厚，資方亦要分一杯襲，甚至不予公開，或竟有私扣等情，所以職工羣起高呼「小賬是我們的」。</p>
<p>農曆除夕，被捕之電力公司職工代表十九名，經該廠全體工友請願後，當局特准保譯，深夜十時，社會局張振遠科長，於保單上塡寫具保之十臨時代表姓名，第一名丁步雲，末一名乃祁登高，因翌日即農曆元旦，實可稱爲佳兆，於是枵腹隨往採訪之新聞記者，莫不喜形於色，精神爲之一爽，都說「張科長勞苦功高，明年官運亨通，平步靑雲，步步登高」。</p>
<p>第四區機製業工會等六十二單位，失業工人四千餘向市政府請願時，總工會代表周學湘氏，及社會局失業工人救濟委員會越班斧氏曾同往工人休中之聖三一教堂廣場，向全體工人解釋，工人紛紛提出要求，請求解答，達二小時，後以留趙氏爲保證，周則往經濟請示，周一去不返，故趙氏又續被　一小時餘，始能脫身，氣喘喘吿記者日「周先生金蟬脫壳計，將我當抵押品」。</p>

<h3>把我們底文化介紹出去</h3>
<p>— 周天收</p>
<p>——給木刻同志</p>
<p>柴門霍夫瀝盡心血創　了世界語，算是採　了各國語言之共通點了，然而這所謂世界語只是一種新創的語言而已，卻不能令世人一目了然。否則，我雖不懂瑪耶珂未斯基俄文原版的「吶喊」，總也不必一味仰教於萬湜思從世界語轉譯的本子了。但同樣地，我不懂德文，刦能從凱綏。珂勒維支的版畫如「失業」「孩子們餓了」，「死亡與女人」中，領悟德國在法西斯獨裁制度的高壓下的勞働大衆的辛酸生涯。我唸不來比文，却也能從麥綏。萊勒底「我底懺悔」及「光明的追求中」，看到比利時小資產階級是如何生活在對美麗的理想的追求中，是怎樣地不安於現狀，而對冥想的　　作熱切的憶憬！</p>
<p>所以，我說這才是眞正的世界語。</p>
<p>西人之藐視我們，往往由於不認識我們以致曲解了我們。在他們凹凸不平的鏡片底下，我們底文化和生活以及思想的趨勢，是呈着何事怪異的物象啊！然而二十世紀的現在，再叫西人從馬可李羅的東方見聞錄中去推求東方的文明，以冀對我們了解嗎？</p>
<p>然而可讓直接推摩的書籍實在也太少了，當他們看了葛利布的「新中國」，一跑到中國知是受驅了，其他所謂中國通者作的報道，則又多半在隔膜情感下把事實扭曲了的。把我們底文化介紹出去，誰說不是當務之急？</p>
<p>如何介紹呢？介把國內各名著譯成西文，這當然是不可或缺的，但在忙於中著正譯時請別忘了版畫是一種有利的宣傳工具，它是沒有國界的，是一種真正使人一目了然的「世界語」，是以樸素的色彩，簡單的畫面，多樣的描繪，赤裸裸地，無吝嗇地，普遍地，把我們的一切訴說給一切不懂華文的人們聽。</p>
<p>所幸我們底木刻藝術已由草率幼稚而追上了國際水準，在同志辛勤的研習與熱切的批評中，民族形式之創造，也已有準確的定型。</p>
<p>努力吧，木刻同志們，以你們對祖國的熱愛而工作着，把我們的文化介紹出去。</p>

<h3>Unfinished Mediation Work in Shandong Province: Jinan Group Flew Back to Beiping Yesterday; Communist Army Requests Discussion in Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] The Jinan Group of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters has completed its mediation work in Shandong. This afternoon, they flew back to Beiping to seek instructions on their work direction from the Executive Headquarters. They will return to Jinan within the week to continue mediation work.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Jinan Group of the Executive Headquarters flew to Linyi, the location of the Shandong Provincial Government of the Communist Party, twice on January 31st and February 2nd, to meet with Chen Shiqu, Chief of Staff, and Chen Yi, Commander of the Communist Party (New Fourth Army). During the meetings, Chen Shiqu stated to Colonel Lake: Upon receiving the cease-fire order, they will certainly adhere to it. However, the Japanese and puppet troops who have not yet surrendered still have intentions to attack the Communist army. If they retreat sixty li according to Order No. 2 concerning Peace, it would be tantamount to relieving the siege of the Japanese and puppet troops, rewarding traitors, and rewarding aggressors. He hoped that the Executive Headquarters would reconsider this point. Regarding the implementation of the cease-fire order and the restoration of transportation, Chen Shiqu also stated that after the cease-fire order was issued, the entire Shandong Province entered a state of cease-fire. The only conflicts that remained were those against the Japanese and puppet troops. Since the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, there was no need for puppet troops to exist. Therefore, having the puppet troops lay down their arms today is a prerequisite for all current issues. The Communist army is capable of disarming the Japanese and puppet troops and has the right to do so. Therefore, the issue of the surrender of Japanese and puppet troops was the focus of the Linyi meeting. During the meeting, Colonel Lake elaborated on his position, stating that he did not represent either the Kuomintang or the Communist Party. The sole purpose of this trip was to find a way to stop the conflict and end the state of war. Lake cited the examples of France and Norway in dealing with enemy troops after all issues had been resolved. He hoped that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party would not dwell on the past, meet with sincerity, and that all issues would be easily resolved. The first meeting did not reach a conclusion. After staying overnight in Linyi on February 6th, the Communist side presented six demands as a result of the meeting, still based on the proposals from the first meeting. The group felt that they could not be resolved, so Chen Shiqu, representing the Communist army, came to Beiping to seek instructions from the Beiping Executive Headquarters. In short, the Communist army in Shandong believes that it controls nine-tenths of the 107 counties in the province, while the government only holds Jinan and Qingdao, which are like isolated islands. Therefore, they firmly advocate that the Japanese troops in Shandong should surrender to them to replenish their weapons. As for the restoration of transportation, the Communist Party believes that the Jiaoji and Jinpu Railways in Shandong are under their control and that they must have the right to guard and manage them before they can be restored.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] According to the government, the New Fourth Army of the Chinese Communist Party has put forward various demands, making it impossible to implement the cease-fire agreement in Shandong, including (1) the abolition of the Jinan and Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, (2) the reorganization of the National Army in Shandong, and (3) the surrender of the local Japanese troops to the Communist army, and the management of railways in the Communist-controlled area by the Communist side. Brigadier General Bird, the American representative of the Beiping Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, is here now and is scheduled to meet with Zhou Enlai today, mainly to discuss these demands.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th] The Xinxiang Group of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters held a symposium on the 7th to exchange views. The Communist Party representative requested that Xiuwu and Huojia counties should be assigned to the Communist army, while the government representative proposed that Meng County should be stationed by the National Army, which became the focus of the dispute. According to reports, Xiuwu and Huojia counties were recovered by the National Army before the cease-fire order, while Meng County was occupied by the Communist army after the cease-fire order.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 8th] The Shijiazhuang Group of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters held a three-person meeting on the 6th, both in the morning and afternoon. In addition to reiterating the No. 2 order of the Executive Headquarters and requiring both parties to strictly comply with it, they also studied the implementation methods of the work. At 7:00 a.m. on the 7th, government representative Hu Pinghan, American representative Greble, Communist Party representative Xu Decao, and others took a special train to the conflict site in Yuanshi to conduct an actual investigation.</p>
<h3>Restoring Rail Traffic in North China: Authorities Are Actively Preparing; Mediation Executive Headquarters Sends Planes to Inspect Various Lines</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 8th] It is reported that the transportation authorities have a preliminary draft and are fully prepared for all preparations for the current restoration of railways in North China, waiting for the notification from the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters. It is said that if there are no complications, the entire restoration work will be completed within two months. It is also learned that after the materials ordered in the United States are shipped to China, the Jingwu Railway will be relaid. The Jinghu Railway has recently added four passenger trains during the Spring Festival to facilitate passengers returning home. Currently, the Jinghu Railway has more vehicles operating than before the war.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] News from transportation circles: Although the issue of restoring railway traffic is still in a stalemate, the third batch of road repair personnel has been ordered to depart. Once an agreement is reached on the road recovery issue, the restoration project of the northern section of Jinpu and the Qianjin along the Jiaoji line will be started first. Today, informed sources said: If Zhang Zhizhong and Zhou Enlai can quickly fly from Chongqing to Shandong, this worrying situation can be opened up in three days.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Chongqing News: Colonel Lake, the American representative of the Jinan Executive Group of the Military Mediation Department, will cancel his resignation due to Marshal Marshall's possible visit to southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu with Zhang Zhizhong and Zhou Enlai to inspect.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] The Military Mediation Executive Headquarters dispatched several reconnaissance planes today to fly to various important locations to inspect traffic conditions, and all returned to Beiping on the same day. [United Press, Tianjin, 8th] Today's Chinese newspapers reported: Night trains will be running between Tianjin and Beiping in the near future. This shows that although the railway line is still guarded by the U.S. Marine Corps, the situation has improved.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Gold Price Stable; Tianjin Gold Price Rises</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 8th] Factory strip opened at 92,500 in the morning, closed at 920,000, opened at 924,000 in the afternoon, closed at 923,000.

<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 8th] The price of pure gold here rose sharply today, reaching a high price of 124,000 yuan per tael, which was entirely stimulated by the Shanghai market. The closing price was also at 118,000 yuan. Rice and flour were also affected by the gold price. The current price of flour is 230 yuan per jin, and rice is 240 yuan per jin, both of which are much higher than before the festival.</p>
<h3>Registration and Exchange of Large Denomination Rupees in Kunming</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Kunming, 7th] The Kunming Chamber of Commerce previously sent a letter to the British Consulate General in Yunnan, requesting the Indian government to find a way to redeem the large denomination rupees circulating in Kunming to avoid affecting Sino-Indian trade. On the 4th, the Acting Consul General of the Consulate, Gao Helu, replied and issued a notice stating: The Indian government has regulations regarding the exchange of large denomination Indian rupees of 500, 1,000, and 10,000 shields held in China for small denomination rupees, but this method only applies to those who obtained the rupees in good faith. The consulate may receive the required official application forms in a week (after February 10), and it is hoped that all interested parties will go to the consulate to register a week later. The Kunming Chamber of Commerce today announced to all sectors of Kunming that those who hold large denomination rupees must register with the provincial and municipal chambers of commerce within two days for submission to the British Consulate for forwarding to the Indian government for processing.</p>
<h3>Judges in Recovered Areas to Receive Higher Salaries</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Xie Guansheng, Minister of Judicial Administration, said that the salaries of judges in the recovered areas are very low because they were not included in last year's budget, and the temporary expenses given are very meager. In Jiangsu, the salaries of judges in various places are no more than 10,000 yuan in legal tender per month, and even one person's food is insufficient. Those with families are suffering unspeakably. It is reported that this year's budget has been approved, and the Ministry of Law must find ways to provide assistance to stabilize their minds and correct any injustices due to the sudden pressure of high prices.</p>

<h3>Starving People Trapped in Various Parts of Shandong Number More Than 500,000; The Tragedy Is Beyond Imagination</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] According to Shandong provincial government officials who came to Beijing from Tai'an, the number of starving people trapped in Tai'an, Yizhou, Lincheng, Zaozhuang, Yixian, and Jimo is more than 500,000. The number of refugees fleeing to Jinan and Xuzhou from various counties in southwestern Shandong is 600,000. Currently, at least 100 people die of starvation every day in Tai'an and Zaozhuang. The trapped people in various places not only need food and clothing relief but also spiritual comfort, because after being disappointed, some people are so angry that they automatically throw their children to death. The tragedy is beyond the imagination of those who live comfortably in cities, drink and chat, and talk about democracy. The Army Department has now requested the Relief Administration to allocate a large amount of flour for relief.</p>
<p>Slightly Capable of Escaping and Seeking Refuge</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] Since the cease-fire order was issued, the Communist army in Shandong Province has continued to carry out its brutal acts in its stationed areas. The counties near Jinan and Qingdao, unable to withstand the trampling and destruction of the Communist army, have all fled to Jinan and Qingdao for refuge. Taking Rizhao County as an example, 20,000 people have fled to Qingdao. According to Zhang Ji, the number of such refugees registered in Qingdao has reached 200,000. According to He Siyuan, there are more than 100,000 such refugees in Jinan. The so-called local Eighth Route Army in various counties is unimaginably brutal, and it is feared that it cannot be controlled by the Communist army. Fair-minded people in various places hope that after the consultative conference, the Communist army should join forces with the National Army to suppress bandits. This call is indeed a noteworthy issue. According to someone who came from Qingdao on January 27, the Communist army's conscription in the Communist-controlled areas is becoming more and more severe, changing the age range to 13 to 45 years old, and even 70-year-old women have to stand guard. Sun Sheng's family property, clothing, and utensils have been completely taken away, and he is still being held in custody. His mother, who is over 90 years old, has also recently been paraded through the streets and forced to sit in a stand-up bamboo basket, which is also one of the Communist army's cruel tortures. The basket is filled with thorny weeds, forcing her to sit in it, with a jolt every three steps, the thorns piercing into her thighs, causing unbearable pain. After the parade, she is ordered to go on stage to confess her crimes. Yang Hanchen wears a white paper hat and is paraded through the streets with his hands tied behind his back. More than a thousand families, including Sun Lechang and Qu Hesheng, have recently been completely taken away. Houses of those who have been struggled against are hung with lanterns, and deaths after being dragged away are common. Recently, a virgin in Shuicheng Village was dragged away, and her breasts were ground off. The walls of Penglai City have recently been completely demolished, and the city has been divided into twenty villages. Recently, each village was ordered to produce a Yangko team, with women stilt-walking and men playing gongs and drums.</p>
<p>Penglai Ancient Pavilion Leveled to the Ground</p>
<p>Penglai Pavilion, a famous scenic spot since the Song Dynasty, has recently been leveled. Cui Weiwu, secretary of Envoy Zhang Xuan, who went to Qingdao, said that the people in his hometown of Yucheng are living a miserable life, and the situation is roughly the same as in Penglai. His aunt, who is over 70 years old, was also tied to a stack of tables by the Communist army and placed on a high platform, forced to announce the crimes of her sons and grandsons who worked outside. The food at home was taken away, leaving them with nothing to live on.</p>
<p>Homeless and Grieving</p>
<p>The reporter is from Rizhao, and his family has more than ten mu of thin land and several heads of livestock, which were confiscated long ago. The forest mountains have also been taken away. After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan and the recovery of the territory, his personal thin land was also taken away, leaving him homeless. Thinking of this, he sighed deeply. The various brutal acts of the Communist Party in his hometown, as described in a letter from Si Xiang from Qingdao, are roughly the same as in other places. Their methods of struggle, such as ordering landlords to compensate tenants for many years of rent and forcing owners to address servants as elders, are also the same as in Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces. If the government and the Communist Party can faithfully implement the secondary proposal of the consultative conference, the reorganization of the Communist army will be successful, and how the social order in its stationed areas will be restored and how the brutal acts of the so-called local Eighth Route Army will be corrected are issues that urgently need to be resolved. Otherwise, the local people in several provinces in North China will have no survivors.</p>

Then, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zhou Yichun attended and reported on the recent agricultural and forestry facilities and the reception of agricultural and forestry enterprises in the recovered areas. Zhou first reviewed the main work of the department last year, which was to increase the production of grain and cotton. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective, but affairs such as reclamation, fishing, and forest protection have not been able to be promoted due to various reasons. He then reported on the situation of agricultural rehabilitation, the handling of post-disaster relief materials, and the reception of enemy and puppet agricultural and forestry enterprises, explaining them separately. Finally, Zhou Min described his work and feelings during his six months as the head of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and put forward discussions on issues such as the use of foreign technology and materials, the use of received enemy and puppet agricultural and forestry enterprises, the cultivation of technical talents, and the strengthening of local agricultural institutions. After the report, senators Qian Gonglai, Wang Puhan, Li Zhongxiang, and Kong Geng raised many inquiries, which Zhou answered separately. Then, the proposals were discussed. Those present at today's meeting were members of the presidium Mo Dehui, Jiang Yong, Wang Yunwu, senators Yin Shuxian, Fan Yushui, Wang Puhan, Qian Gonglai, Wu Zhaoxu, Luo Heng, Xu Deheng, Kong Geng, Li Zhongxiang, He Baoren, Chen Bosheng, Xu Xiaoyan, Hu Jianzhong, Chen Qitian, Department Secretary-General Lizi, and Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen, totaling nineteen people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] At the 15th meeting of the Senate on the 8th, two proposals and one inquiry were passed as follows: (1) Senator Wang (Puhan and three others) proposed that the national cotton price has fallen sharply, which has greatly affected the livelihood of farmers, and the purchase and transportation of foreign cotton may deepen this crisis. It is requested that the government give priority to purchasing and using domestic cotton stocks, promote cotton loans, and encourage cotton production to protect the interests of farmers and save the bankruptcy of rural areas. It was decided to send it to the government for practical handling. (2) Senator Yin Shuxian and three others proposed that the government increase the salaries of public servants and teachers promptly and practically based on the price index. It was decided to send it to the government for prompt handling. (3) Senator Qian Gonglai and three others proposed that they had recently read in the newspaper that Zhang Xinmin and eight others, members of the Fushun Coal Mine Reception Committee of the Northeast Camp, were killed on their way back to Shenyang. They do not know the truth and ask the government to investigate and reply. It was decided to send it to the government to investigate and reply.</p>

<h3>Situation in the Northeast Remains Chaotic; Rumored to Be Related to New Sino-Soviet Economic Negotiations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] The repeated delays in the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast are rumored to be related to new Sino-Soviet economic negotiations regarding the disposition of mining and industry in the Nine Eastern Provinces. Observers with informed sources here have gradually come to believe this rumor. After the Political Consultative Conference resolved various internal issues of China, at least in theory, the attention of the Chinese press has shifted back to the Nine Eastern Provinces. It is said that all heavy industry in the area is still in Soviet hands.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] Qualified sources here told a United Press reporter that the Northeast today is facing the darkest moment in its history. This powder keg of the Far East is already smoldering, brewing a future war in Asia. Informed sources revealed that, to date, there is no sign that the Northeast issue has been submitted to any United Nations agency, and it remains in a "ominous state." They pointed out that there are many reasons why the situation in the Northeast has become difficult, most of which are international in nature. They are listed as follows: (1) The Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference stipulated that Soviet troops should withdraw from the Northeast by February 3rd, but this has been delayed again. To date, neither Chongqing nor Moscow officials have provided any explanation for this extension. (2) The mysterious difficulties encountered by the Chinese government forces in taking over the garrison work in Jinzhou and Changchun. (3) There are Communist forces in the southern part of the Nine Eastern Provinces and a "Communist League" in the northern part, posing as resistance to the government forces. (4) The emergence of the newly independent "East Mongolian Autonomous Republic," with its capital located in Wangyemiao, 220 miles northwest of Changchun. (5) The mysterious Sino-Soviet negotiations on the joint management of Northeast mining areas, heavy industry, and transportation. Neither Chongqing nor Moscow officials have provided any information on this matter. (6) The Red Army has renewed contracts with local grain and coal merchants until the end of May. (7) The Communist Party is taking this opportunity to demand that the Central Government allow it to participate in the handover of Northeast sovereignty from the Red Army. (8) The increasingly imminent threat of civil war, as the Northeast is not included in the ceasefire agreement signed between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on January 20th. (9) There are still two million Japanese military and civilians in the Northeast waiting to be repatriated. (10) There is an unknown number of former Japanese mercenaries in the Northeast, who are now being used by various political groups. Some are affiliated with the Communist Party, some are affiliated with the "Communist League," and most are affiliated with the Mongolian cavalry of the new "East Mongolian Autonomous Republic."</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 7th] The "New York Herald Tribune" discussed the issue of the continued presence of Soviet troops in the Northeast today, stating that the United States' participation in the discussions between Chongqing and Moscow on this matter is based on the United States' "traditional desire to maintain China's territorial integrity." The newspaper believes that it is extremely important that the disagreements between the United States and the Soviet Union on this issue should be resolved in a friendly spirit. "But the independence and well-being of the Chinese and Korean people should be considered first." The "New York Times" commented on the Korean issue, stating that the occupation situation in Korea is far from satisfactory. [Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] February 23rd is Soviet Red Army Day. The Soviet troops here are preparing a grand celebration at that time.</p>

<h3>Constant Conflicts between National Army and Separatist Factions: An Outline of the Xinjiang Situation; Special Article from Our Newspaper; Sent by Zhu Minwei After Returning from Xinjiang</h3>
<p>Xinjiang Province—this fertile and still undeveloped virgin land in the cold desert—has a population of four million, among whom, besides the Han people, there are other ethnic groups such as the Kazakhs, Uyghurs, and Mongols. For decades, there have been no significant conflicts or struggles among these disparate groups. However, in the past year or two, the Kazakhs, because they have not shed the habit of robbery, and coupled with new factors, have repeatedly stirred up warfare in the desert, causing concern among people at home and abroad. Fortunately, after our National Government dispatched General Zhang Zhizhong to Xinjiang for negotiations, the situation of warfare came to an end. Now the Kazakhs are once again using the excuse that the negotiation agreement has not been approved by our government to provoke the National Army, which is noteworthy. The author of this article recently went to Xinjiang on official business for the Political Department of the Aviation Commission and has just returned to Shanghai a few days ago. Based on what he has seen and heard, he has written two special articles, which will be published in our newspaper in succession, to share with our readers. (Editor)</p>
<p>Starting from November 7th of the year before last (1944), the prelude to the war in the Xinjiang desert was opened by the battle for the defense of Yining city. Defending the Yining city area were the Seventh Reserve Division, the Air Force Training Corps, and the local troops of the Yining area. Attacking were the Kazakh cavalry.</p>
<p>Kazakh Cavalry Stir Up Desert War</p>
<p>How did this war start? No one can say for sure the immediate cause. If one must find some reason, it can be said to be the manifestation of the conflict between settled economic forces and nomadic economic forces. Those who have been to the Northwest know that there is a clan in the desert called the Kazakhs. This is a nomadic clan similar to the Mongols. The population is not large, and their base is in the Altai Mountains bordering Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The Kazakhs are accustomed to nomadic life, with no fixed residence. Like the Mongols living in "Mongolian yurts," the Kazakhs live in "Kazakh yurts." The form and structure of the "yurt" are extremely simple. Mud and grass are their main materials. In Xinjiang, when mentioning the Kazakhs in the Altay region, everyone knows that this term is linked to the meaning of robbery and plunder. This Kazakh clan, based in the Altay region, has been drifting in a nomadic state throughout history. The rugged terrain of the Altay region has protected them like an impregnable fortress. The Junggar Basin south of the Altay region and the entire northern Xinjiang north of the Tianshan Mountains are naturally their nomadic grasslands and plunder areas. Especially in the past twenty years, the Kazakhs in the Altay region have been unable to invade to the north and west (the Northwest is all Soviet territory). They have no choice but to forever direct their fierce gaze at the settled clans in the south. The urban areas of the northern Xinjiang region, centered on Dihua, are mainly Han and Uyghur agricultural and commercial areas. Therefore, the Kazakhs regard the Han and Uyghur people as thorns in their sides. In addition, the military and political power of Xinjiang Province has been in the hands of the Han people for decades. The first goal of the Kazakhs in battle is naturally to "kill all the Han people." In October 1944, it was precisely the period of transition in the Xinjiang provincial regime. Governor Sheng Shicai, who had ruled Xinjiang for fifteen years, had just been transferred to Chongqing in August. Wu Zhongxin, who was known for his deep understanding of Mongolian and Tibetan border affairs, came to lead the provincial administration. The Kazakhs felt that this was an opportunity, coupled with other factors. The Kazakh cavalry charged into the Yining city area, a vital town in the western frontier of northern Xinjiang, on November 7, 1944.</p>
<p>Sabers Enter Yining; Garrison Soldiers Determined and Firm</p>
<p>Yining is a border city where various ethnic groups live together, with a population of over 80,000. The Uyghurs and naturalized groups (Russians who entered Xinjiang during the old Russian era and were naturalized after the Soviet revolution) are the most numerous. The customs and habits are similar to those of the new urban areas of Harbin, with a strong Russian urban flavor. In this place, as early as the beginning of our country's war of resistance, the Soviet Union assisted our air force in training, so there was a large air force barracks and several airports. In this battle for the defense of Yining, the air force barracks and airfield located in Alinbagh (place name) became the most intense battle centers in Yining. The battle lasted for eighty-seven days. This first battle of the Xinjiang War was truly fierce. Both sides were determined to win. If the defending soldiers failed, there was no reason to live, only to be beheaded by the Kazakh sabers. The Kazakhs were determined to capture this rich city. Whether they could control part of Xinjiang in their hands was a key. The Kazakhs increased from 10,000 to 20,000. The entire Yining city area gradually fell into their hands, but the training corps barracks and airfield remained in the hands of the defending soldiers.</p>
<p>National Army from Lanzhou Advances Westward on a Long Snowy Journey</p>
<p>Of course, our government did not want this important place to fall. But if we do not forget the situation a year and a half ago, we naturally remember that November 1944 was precisely when Guilin and Liuzhou fell, and the Japanese army advanced rapidly toward Guiyang. The entire landscape of China was as dark as the winter season. Commander Zhu Shaoliang led a force from Lanzhou, traveling west day and night, but the snowy journey from Xingxingxia to Yining was too long. The air transport planes were busy transporting Tang Enbo's troops from Xi'an to Guiyang to build an emergency defense line to prevent the Japanese army from advancing north to Chongqing. Air Force Commander Luo Ji desperately requested several air transport planes to personally send weapons, ammunition, salt, and medicine, and also send Guokui (flatbread) to Yining. This kind of rescue undoubtedly supported the hearts of the defending troops, but when all their strength was exhausted, those defending soldiers could only regret losing this jewel on the national border when they died. The troops of Li Tiejun, who rushed to Dihua from Xingxingxia, only had time to build a defense line in front of Jinghe County to defend against the Kazakh cavalry occupying Yining from advancing eastward.</p>
<p>However, it was also quite difficult to supply the Jinghe front line from Dihua via Suilai Wusu, a long road equivalent to that from Chengdu to Wanxian. This supply line was not only exposed to the wind and snow of the severe winter in the Northwest but was also entirely exposed to the threat of the Kazakh cavalry in the Altay region. Therefore, throughout the winter, until May 1945, small groups of Kazakh cavalry harassed the line from Jinghe to Dihua from time to time. Due to the difficulty of supply and the lack of equipment to resist the freezing of thirty degrees below zero, the army officers and soldiers from Lanzhou not only had difficulty launching attacks but also stiffened in the trenches or had their hands and feet frozen off. After the arrival of spring, the war seemed a little more lively due to the vitality of the sun, but due to the disparity in strength, the Kazakh cavalry still defeated our infantry everywhere.</p>
<p>From spring to the present, the military situation in northern Xinjiang for the past six months has still been unfavorable. At the end of July, the situation in Tacheng, another border town in northern Xinjiang, was unclear. Emin, near Tacheng, was lost. Commander Wan, who was bitterly defending Chenghua City at the southern foot of the Altay Mountains, was certainly holding on to the death. However, ground transportation has been cut off, and there is only one line for transporting ammunition and other military supplies by air, while southern Xinjiang has always been a prosperous and peaceful industrial park. On August 14th, Baicheng in southern Xinjiang was lost to the Kazakhs who crossed the Tianshan Mountains. (It was then recaptured by the garrison on August 19th.) In September, Wusu, a vital place on the Dihua-Jinghe line, was occupied by the Kazakhs coming down from the Altay region. The defensive front had to be rearranged, with Suilai as the first line, forming a defensive posture to defend Dihua to the death. This is the outline of the war that has taken place in the Xinjiang desert in the past year.</p>
<p>Wu Zhongxin's Style as a Classical-Style Head of Household</p>
<p>The sixty-two-year-old Wu Zhongxin has always been a figure in the government who frequently comes into contact with border affairs. When the central government changed the new provincial government, this old man was sent here. After arriving in Xinjiang Province, he did many things quietly. This is a more classical-style head of household. He observed and listened, handling the affairs of the new province based on his forty years of political principles and experience. First, he released the thousands of political prisoners held in the Dihua prison in the provincial capital. These prisoners included Uyghurs and Han people. Many of the Uyghur prisoners were leaders in the Uyghur community. This matter improved the poor relationship between the government and the various ethnic groups under its rule. It is known that Wu Chairman knew that Xinjiang had made the mistake of Han chauvinism in the past, so he tried his best to appoint talented people from various ethnic groups to many government positions. For example, each department of the provincial government set up a deputy director. The deputy director of the Construction Department was a Mongolian, and the administrative commissioner of the Dihua region was a Tatar student who had studied in Germany. Many county magistrates were Uyghurs. The Uyghurs, Tachs, and Kazakhs jointly formed a Comfort Commission in Dihua. This commission regularly carries out comfort work for remote ethnic groups. After Wu Chairman arrived in the province, many ethnic representatives came to Dihua from all over the province to see him. He felt that at least all ethnic groups knew that the new provincial government in Dihua was approachable, which meant that the first step towards a new beginning with the people had been taken.</p>
<p>Senators from Various Ethnic Groups Gather in Dihua for Negotiations</p>
<p>In August and September of this year, the temporary Senate of Xinjiang Province was convened. I saw cars after cars of Uyghur senators from southern Xinjiang and senators from other ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province gathering in Dihua. War is a chasm that divides the government and the Kazakh cavalry on both sides, but in the promotion of the entire provincial administration, Chairman Wu took into account giving political power to various ethnic groups, giving them freedom, and giving them the opportunity to participate in being masters of Xinjiang Province. In August, even one of the four leaders of the Kazakhs in the Altay region voluntarily came to negotiate. The government plane flew to the Chenghua airfield and landed, taking him to Dihua. Chairman Wu, this old man, believes that reason can be communicated with any ethnic group. Therefore, in the turmoil in Xinjiang, he did not publicize any great principles but simply and practically sorted things out peacefully, like untangling a tangled thread.</p>
<p>Promoting War and Construction Simultaneously</p>
<p>Although Xinjiang is at war, construction work is being carried out closely to meet political needs. Without a doubt, the economic phenomena on the surface of Xinjiang consist of the coexistence of nomadic and agricultural societies. The construction effort of the Xinjiang provincial government is to gradually improve the economic structure and form to achieve the purpose of Xinjiang's progress. For example, from labor on the ground to development underground, from nomadism to agriculture, from agriculture and small handicrafts to industrial production. Planned government construction is indeed more powerful in Xinjiang Province than the natural development of the social economy.</p>
<p>At present, the construction work in Xinjiang that directly benefits the people is water conservancy, followed by transportation. If there is a railway from Lanzhou, connecting the transportation within Xinjiang Province, the movement of people and the circulation of goods can be smoothly resolved. At present, apart from irregular aviation and automobiles connecting the inland and Xinjiang, Xinjiang is in fact isolated from the inland. The situation is no different from the relationship between Tibet, Outer Mongolia, and the inland. Therefore, I hope that the western extension of the Longhai Railway will end west of Lanzhou and be closer to Xinjiang than being far away from Xinjiang. Of course, due to resource constraints and geographical proximity, Xinjiang needs to obtain the assistance of the Soviet Union in transportation construction and the development of important mineral resources, which requires breaking the diplomatic deadlock.

<h3>Solving the City's Traffic Problem</h3>
<p>— A Commoner</p>
<p>Improving Traffic Regulations; Enforcing Traffic Control</p>
<p>On the eve of the victory of the War of Resistance—from 1944 to 1945—in major cities in the rear such as Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, and Guiyang, due to the concentration of military vehicles and the surge in transportation volume, traffic order was chaotic, leading to unfortunate accidents that caused injuries and deaths. At that time, there were many American military vehicles in various places, so the transportation authorities felt that Americans were not accustomed to driving on the left. They planned to switch to driving on the right to correct all weaknesses. After the victory, Shanghai's traffic also encountered the same problem. Therefore, on January 1st of this year, the authorities resolutely decided to switch all traffic nationwide to driving on the right.</p>
<p>Now, this system has been in place for over a month. During this month, how much effect has it actually had? How much has order improved? How many deaths and injuries have been reduced? The municipal authorities must have investigated and compiled statistics on the number of incidents that have occurred. The January 31st newspaper reported that General Wedemeyer "intends to visit Mayor Qian Shiwei to discuss remedies because Shanghai's traffic situation is quite chaotic," which shows that the current traffic order in Shanghai has still not been sufficiently improved, causing concern for our allies. Therefore, we ourselves must quickly solve our own problems and take effective measures as soon as possible. Stabilize ourselves and facilitate others.</p>
<p>The way to solve traffic chaos and reduce accidents causing injuries and deaths, to put it boldly, cannot be solved by simply driving on the right or left. The basic principles lie in having regulations for driving and having control over driving. When Americans drive in their own country, they are familiar with American traffic regulations and abide by their traffic controls. However, when they arrive in major Chinese cities, some places have no regulations, and some places have traffic regulations but no control methods. As such, because we ourselves fundamentally lack order, foreigners are at a loss in this environment, and they will therefore disregard and boldly rush around, causing many unfortunate incidents, making it impossible for us to sanction them. However, we should also state that Americans often cause accidents while driving after drinking alcohol, for which they alone must bear responsibility. Therefore, Shanghai needs to explore these two aspects to improve traffic in order to solve the entire problem. The self-examination should start with asking: Do we ourselves have comprehensive traffic regulations? Do we ourselves enforce traffic according to these regulations? Then ask: Do we need to improve our various traffic control equipment and methods? Generally speaking, these issues need to be studied from multiple perspectives. First, our traffic volume must be suitable for the width of our streets. Second, our streets must have classified properties in order to channel our traffic congestion. Third, our traffic lights must be functional in order to meet actual needs, so as to avoid chaos and danger. Fourth, when our vehicles have no passengers, the place and time of their stop must not affect or obstruct the movement of traffic. Fifth, pedestrians on the road must use the functions of the sidewalk and must not walk randomly in the middle of the street in order to avoid the risk of injury or death. Sixth, how do we enforce control over these actions that do not comply with regulations, so that we can gradually guide them into normal behavior? Seventh, how can we make cars, pedicabs, rickshaws, and bicycles travel in separate lanes, so that they do not interfere with each other and avoid the chance of collision? Eighth, how do we revise our traffic regulations, how do we improve our control equipment, and at the same time, how can we make millions of people in the city understand these regulations and know their obligation to comply? These issues cannot be fully explained in a few words; we must discuss and plan each aspect in detail.</p>
<p>I believe that before the entire plan is decided, there are five urgent matters that need to be implemented immediately:</p>
<p>(1) The streets of the entire city should be re-designated with a traffic-oriented street system based on the number of vehicles and the direction of travel on each street. For example, important streets should be designated as thoroughfares, and connecting non-important streets can be designated as one-way streets or stop streets. Definite parking spaces should be marked on various streets, and all kinds of vehicles should not be allowed to stop on the street at will.</p>
<p>(2) The traffic lights at important street intersections should be changed to fixed-time signals. It must be able to display the prohibition or permission of turning left, turning right, and reversing at that location, so as to save the traffic police who control the traffic lights and instead use them for patrol and control work, and to increase the function of the traffic lights. Unimportant intersections can be equipped with flashing signals to guide traffic and pedestrians.</p>
<p>(3) The police force should add a traffic police system and train traffic police officers, teaching them modern traffic management knowledge. If necessary, a traffic court can be established in the police station to execute punishments for those who disrupt traffic order, and to analyze the causes of traffic accidents to prove who is responsible for the accident.</p>
<p>(4) Pedestrians must be able to fully utilize the sidewalk and must not walk in the middle of the street, and they must not cross the road at will in any place. Pedestrians who want to cross the road must cross it in the designated place to avoid danger. In this regard, not only is the guidance of traffic police needed, but also efforts must be made to make the public feel the need for this action.</p>
<p>(5) Set up more slogans and promote more publicity, so that the general Chinese and foreign public can have a deep understanding of traffic order and traffic regulations, so as to have an automatic behavior of complying with everything, and then reduce unfortunate incidents.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest city in the country, and maintaining traffic order is a very important and necessary administration. In general, the quality of a city's municipal administration can be seen from its traffic order. Traffic regulations and traffic control are specialized disciplines. Shanghai must solve the current traffic problem, and there is no doubt that it must start from these two aspects, and it cannot be shifted by simply implementing driving on the right or left. Alas! No city in China has good traffic order. Walking through each city, the traffic situation is completely chaotic! Therefore, I hope that Shanghai can lay the foundation for traffic management in our country, serve as a model for traffic management in cities across the country, and thereby resolve the current misunderstandings between allied personnel and our Chinese people caused by traffic accidents, and reasonably analyze who is ultimately responsible for such accidents.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Dark Clouds in a Bright Atmosphere</h3>
<p>According to a special dispatch from Beiping in our newspaper yesterday, the situation in the Northeast has become increasingly complex in the past week. According to reliable sources, an organization called the "East Mongolia Autonomous Government" was established on January 15th in Wangye Temple, the capital of the former puppet Manchukuo Xing'an South Province, and announced the independence of the "East Mongolia Republic" in its National Congress. The chairman of the government, Wu'erzhan, is a Buryat Mongolian general affiliated with the Soviet Union. This news only reached here yesterday due to transportation delays. It is understood that the so-called East Mongolia refers to the Zhuolei Tu and Zhelimu leagues, and its area includes most of the three northeastern provinces of Xing'an, Liaobei, and Rehe. The newly established "East Mongolia Autonomous Government" has determined its national flag to be a red flag with a yellow miner's knife and whip inlaid on it, indicating that it is an agricultural and pastoral country. Agence France-Presse also had similar reports yesterday. On the same day, a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, citing private sources, said that the National Army and Xinjiang separatists had clashed again. The conflict was caused by the central government's failure to approve the agreement signed by Chiang Kai-shek's special envoy Zhang Zhizhong and three representatives of the separatists. The separatists are mostly Turks, and the entire territory is called the "East Turkestan Republic," with its capital in Yining. These two news items, one from the Northeast and one from the Northwest, are truly regrettable when the whole country is immersed in a peaceful atmosphere caused by the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference. Although this news still needs to be verified and further developed, it is generally a well-founded report. All this news inevitably shows a few more dark clouds in the gradually clearing political sky.</p>
<p>Since the surrender of the enemy, the situation in the Northeast has been clear and dark at times in the past five months, almost like periodic malaria. This situation has continued to this day and has not been greatly improved. According to a Chongqing dispatch in our newspaper on the 7th, the Soviet army was originally scheduled to withdraw from the Northeast at the beginning of this month, but it has been delayed again. Now, the main personnel who are to take over are coming to Chongqing one after another to ask for instructions, and their actions are confidential and tight-lipped. On the other hand, news also says that the takeover of factories and mines in the Northeast has been suspended, and experts have to stay in North China to work. The personnel we sent to the Northeast to take over are mostly tight-lipped about the situation in the Northeast, and the experts can see the Northeast but cannot reach it. General public opinion has not commented much on the situation in the Northeast. Some people, especially us reporters, only allow themselves to see the bright side of the dark side of the situation in the Northeast and try to exaggerate it, hoping to be self-indulgent in the exaggeration. All this is truly unspeakably difficult. However, today, when the situation in the Northeast has been deadlocked for more than five months, and new situations have been unfolding one after another in the past five months, if we still cannot reveal a little in our tolerance and silence, we are truly ashamed to be reporters again, and we are really too sorry for the people of the country.</p>
<p>Why do we need to tolerate and remain silent about the situation in the Northeast? This is because we deeply cherish the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. Because we believe that the Soviet Union will fulfill its commitments and respect the treaty of friendship between China and the Soviet Union, we always look on the bright side under the basic right of "freedom of speech" and would rather tolerate and remain silent. However, the development of the situation in the Northeast over the past five months cannot but make us deeply anxious. The National Army taking over the defense of the Northeast cannot use the seaports of the Northeast and must advance along the railway line from Qinhuangdao, and it has not yet entered the city of Shenyang that the Chinese people will never forget! From the Liaodong Peninsula across the great plains of the Northeast to the border between China and the Soviet Union, it is said that there are still so-called "people's armies" in each of these places! After this series of unpleasant news, the news of the sudden emergence of a so-called "East Mongolia Autonomous Government" has recently come!</p>
<p>The leader of the "East Mongolia Autonomous Government" is said to be a Buryat Mongolian affiliated with the Soviet Union, who graduated from the Soviet Red Army University and received the title of General in the Red Army. The Buryat Mongolians live around Lake Baikal. Although they are Mongolians like the Inner Mongolians in the Northeast, they are not indigenous to the local area, and they are also generals in the Red Army. The truth of this so-called "autonomous" movement is highly questionable. Moreover, the agreement on the Northeast region was concluded by the Chinese National Government and the Soviet Government. Before the power of the National Government reached the Northeast, the Soviet authorities had the treaty obligation to transfer the entire Northeast to the National Government for takeover. Therefore, within its defense zone, any situation that arises and develops that conflicts with the interests of the Chinese National Government is difficult for the Soviet Union to ignore. Therefore, even if this so-called "East Mongolia Autonomous" movement is a spontaneous movement of the local people, we believe that the Soviet army, which is responsible for maintaining order, will also stop it. Otherwise, won't this situation of dividing China's borderlands gradually obscure the light?</p>
<p>The same divisive movement has also appeared in the Northwest, which is far away from the "Mengjiang" of the Northeast. In the western border of Xinjiang, the so-called "East Turkestan Republic" has also appeared. The "Turkestan Republic" in Central Asia was originally a part of the Soviet Union. What is the relationship between the "East Turkestan Republic" that has appeared in Xinjiang today and the "Turkestan Republic"? We don't know, and we don't want to speculate. The Soviet Union also has the "Kazakh Republic" and the "Tajik Republic" in Central Asia, and there are Kazakhs and "Tajiks" in our Xinjiang. If this principle of division can be recognized, then we will no longer have Xinjiang! Outer Mongolia established the "People's Republic" and recently left us. The "Tannu Uriankhai People's Republic" also left us long ago and joined the territory of the Soviet Union. Today, there is the "East Mongolia Republic" in the Northeast and the "East Turkestan Republic" in the Northwest. What will happen to them in the future? Only future history can prove it. Coincidentally, we see the Azerbaijan autonomous movement in Iran and the Kurdish autonomous movement in Iraq from afar, which are similar in different ways and are a sight to behold. In order to maintain the integrity of our territory and the integrity of our sovereignty, we did not hesitate to wage a long-term war of resistance against Japan. Now that victory is in sight, the situation before us is a map showing the beginning of piecemeal encroachment, which truly makes us ashamed to be a "great power"!</p>
<p>China and the Soviet Union are adjacent to each other, from the west coast of the Pacific Ocean through the Ussuri River, the Heilongjiang River, across the desert and the Altai Mountains, to the Pamir Plateau. The length of the border between them is unmatched in the world. The Soviet Union is eager for peace, and the Chinese people love peace even more. Yesterday, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov's speech stated that "for the sake of world peace, the Soviet Union is always prepared to maintain friendly cooperation with large and small countries that love peace." The Chinese government and people fully agree with this. Former US Vice President Wallace once said when he came to China years ago that the length of the border between China and the Soviet Union can only be compared to the border between the United States and Canada, and he hoped that the border between China and the Soviet Union would be as sufficient as the border between the United States and Canada to promote understanding and cooperation between the two countries. We also truly hope that this long border can be like the border between the United States and Canada, where there is never any need for defense. The "East Mongolia Republic" that has appeared in the Northeast and the "East Turkestan Republic" in Xinjiang, we certainly believe that there is no support from the Soviet Union in them, but the former appears in the Soviet military-occupied area, and the latter appears in an area closely adjacent to the Soviet border, which is ultimately unavoidable as a dark cloud in a bright atmosphere. China needs peace, but it also needs security. China needs democracy, but it also needs unity. Peace, security, democracy, and unity all require a complete China.</p>

<h3>US Military Also Responsible for Sending Japanese Nationals in Northeast Back to Their Country; General Wedemeyer Answers Reporters' Questions</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] At 11:00 AM yesterday, General Wedemeyer, Commander of the US Military China Theater, received Chinese and foreign reporters at the Construction Building. He gave detailed answers to various questions regarding the Northeast. Wedemeyer also stated that he expects the Chinese army to enter the Northeast in about a month.</p>
<p>A reporter present asked: Will the US also handle the Japanese army in the three northeastern provinces? General Wei said that the United States also has the responsibility of sending Japanese nationals back to their country in the Northeast and will provide the same transportation and other tools. The United States will provide assistance in areas north of 16 degrees latitude, such as Hainan Island and Taiwan. From the time of Japan's surrender to the period of US President Truman's statement on Far Eastern policy, the US has sent a total of 25,000 Japanese soldiers and civilians back by the US. It is now advancing to 360,000 people. At the same time, the US military is investigating the situation of the Japanese army in the Northeast through official and legitimate procedures to lay the foundation for carrying out the mission. However, the most important aspects of sending people back are the problems of transportation and food. This depends on whether the Chinese side has the ability to control transportation and food. And I hope that this can be resolved within a month.</p>
<p>No News of Soviet Withdrawal</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of journalists going to the Northeast to work, General Wei himself believes that if reporters from every country can be in the Northeast and report the facts fully, it would be an excellent thing. However, he has not received any response at the moment and is also inconvenient to promote this matter. He also has not received news about the withdrawal of Soviet troops in the Northeast. The US military is currently busy with transporting the New Sixth Army, sending Japanese nationals back, and has no time to take care of other less important matters. However, official information about the situation of the Japanese army is being obtained. He knows nothing about the rumors that Japanese soldiers and civilians in the three northeastern provinces have withdrawn to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Striving to Reduce US Military in China</p>
<p>When asked about the number and date of personnel coming to China to take over in the next three months, and the news that about 4,500 US troops will return home, General Wei felt difficult to answer this kind of unconfirmed report. He briefly said: I have previously reported that "perhaps" about 4,000 US troops will return home, but I did not say "definitely." After the families of US troops received unconfirmed reports, they often sent letters to inquire, which not only made it difficult for me to handle matters, but also made the US military department in Washington inconvenient. I will now give a general answer, that is, I will strive to reduce the US military in all parts of China, only seeking a sufficient number to carry out the work. Personnel who have achieved high scores will naturally return home according to the scheduled plan.</p>
<p>US Advisory Group Assists in Building the Military</p>
<p>The US Military Advisory Group in China has not yet been established. If it is established, its job will be entirely to assist China in building the navy, army, and air force. However, all service personnel are volunteers, and of course, a small number of them must have experience serving here to provide guidance. If the advisory group is established, the navy and army will be formed separately, but the heads of both sides will cooperate with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to facilitate the progress of the work.</p>
<p>General Wei said that there is no such thing as rumors that the US Army will withdraw completely and the Navy will carry out all tasks. If the Military Advisory Group is established, there will be more and more important army personnel than naval personnel. This rumor may have been caused by Admiral Cooke's visit to Chongqing. In fact, Admiral Cooke's visit to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was purely a courtesy visit, and there was no jealousy between the navy and army.</p>
<p>Restoring Official Ranks After the End of the War</p>
<p>General Wei said that US military officers are now being demoted, and that most officers were promoted during the war. Now that the war is over, they will return to their previous ranks. I received a list from Washington stating when a certain person should return to their previous rank and execute it. However, there are also some officers who will not be demoted.</p>
<p>A reporter asked that two Japanese war criminals who were captured in Japan this time in connection with the murder of three pilots under General Doolittle, one had been sent and one was still in Japan. When will he come to China? General Wei said that it was inconvenient to answer why he was left in Japan. General MacArthur and I cooperated very well. If General MacArthur thinks that this other war criminal should be left in Japan, there must be his reasons, and I think this move is quite reasonable.</p>
<h3>He Zhuguo Goes Blind, Will Go to the US for Treatment</h3>
<p>General He Zhuguo, the former commander of the 15th Army Corps, suddenly went blind. Medical treatment in Chongqing was ineffective. He took a flight from Chongqing to Shanghai a few days ago for diagnosis and treatment, waiting for a ship to go to the United States for medical treatment.</p>
<h3>Xue Yue and Chennault Visit President Song</h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, President Song received General Xue Yue, China Merchants Bureau President Xu Xueyu, and Liu Hongsheng at the Executive Yuan Office in the Bank of China Building. At around 4:00 PM, he received General Chennault and several people from foreign trade.</p>
<h3>UN Relief Supplies Shipped to China Reach More Than 160,000 Tons</h3>
<p>As of January 31, the UN supplies received by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration totaled 168,482.3 tons shipped to Shanghai, of which 55,718.225 tons were transferred from Shanghai to various parts of the country, leaving a total of 112,763,075 tons. Among them, 50,000 tons of wheat are being ground into flour, 30,000 tons of industrial equipment and 20,000 tons of automobiles are being assembled. A total of 24 ships arrived in Shanghai, carrying supplies including: (1) Food: a total of 143,757.9 tons, (2) Clothing: a total of 7,335.9 tons, (3) Agricultural equipment: a total of 2,042.7 tons, (4) Industrial equipment: a total of 14,566.3 tons, (5) Medical and health equipment: a total of 779.5 tons. General Strathmeyer will leave Shanghai for the United States on the 11th to take on important new responsibilities in Washington. The nature of his new mission has not been announced. General Strathmeyer is 54 years old this year and came to China in July last year to serve as the head of the Air Force. Before coming to China, he served concurrently as the commander of the US Air Force in the India-Burma Theater and the commander of the Far East Air Force. During the period when General Wedemeyer, the commander of the US military stationed in China, was away from China, General Shi acted as his agent to carry out all tasks to the best of his ability. The materials include shipments from Shanghai to (1) Kowloon to Guangzhou, (2) Kowloon to Guangxi, (3) Qinhuangdao to Tianjin, (4) Zhoushan, (5) Zhenjiang, (6) Changzhou, (7) Danyang, (8) Nanjing, (9) Hankou, (10) Hankou to Changsha and other parts of Hunan, (11) Hankou to Chongqing, (12) Jiujiang, (13) Wuhu, (14) Hangzhou, (15) Zhuji, (16) Kaifeng, (17) Qingdao, etc.</p>
<h3>Korean Soldiers and Civilians in China Actively Plan to Return Home</h3>
<p>Regarding the management and repatriation of unarmed Korean soldiers and Korean residents in China, in addition to establishing a management office for unarmed Korean soldiers to strictly manage and train them, Marshal MacArthur, the commander of the headquarters stationed in Japan, has dispatched Captain Taylor and two Koreans, Park Seon-bong and Park Chi-kyun, to Shanghai to work closely with the Shanghai Port Transportation Command to actively plan for the repatriation of Korean residents in China.</p>
<h3>Repatriation Figures for Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>According to a statement released by the Shanghai Port Transportation Command, as of yesterday, the number of Japanese residents repatriated from this city totaled 22,678, and the number of Japanese prisoners of war was 96,253, for a combined total of 118,931. In addition, 1,816 compatriots of Taiwanese origin have also been repatriated. At the same time, more than 2,000 Italian sailors and residents will also be repatriated in the near future.</p>
<h3>Labor and Management Approaching Agreement at the Electric Company</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Felice Lugan Dowling, the representative of the electric company's management, went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday at 2:00 PM upon request to report to Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan on the company's business situation and the measures taken regarding the current labor unrest. Section Chief Zhang presented the labor side's ten demands one by one for discussion and solicited the management's opinions. On the issue of year-end bonuses, the management agreed to abide by the city government's regulations, granting one month's salary to all employees who have worked for more than one year. They are also willing to consider improving the age restrictions for retirement benefits and will respond on Monday. As for the issue of salary increases, they will await arbitration by the city government. Through the dedicated persuasion of Section Chief Zhang and Li Kaidi of the Public Utilities Bureau, Mr. Feishi is willing to consider all conditions. Labor and management's opinions are gradually converging, and the next negotiation should proceed smoothly.</p>

<h3>Visiting Zuo Shunsheng</h3>
<p>— Cang Long</p>
<p>"My personal view has always been that the interests of the nation come first, the interests of the people second, the common interests of the international community third, and the interests of political parties fourth. There's no point in overemphasizing the interests of political parties..."</p>
<p>Wearing a blue cloth robe, cloth warm shoes, and hair without the nourishment of oil wax, Mr. Zuo Shunsheng, with his long, round face and seven-part seriousness, gave me the impression of a Chinese commoner. After the reporter extended his hand for a handshake and explained his purpose, he immediately asked him to express some political views. A few smiles appeared on his serious face. After a moment of silence, he finally said:</p>
<p>"I did not participate in the Political Consultative Conference this time, but I know the details of the process very well. Now the conference has already reached a conclusion, and the Constitutional Drafting Committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting on the 14th of this month."</p>
<p>"The National Assembly will be convened on May 5th of this year, and the steps for drafting and implementing the constitution will be separated. How the next National Assembly will be convened after this National Assembly is convened depends on how this constitutional draft is stipulated."</p>
<p>"As far as I know, all parties have conducted lengthy research and exchanged opinions on this constitutional draft. In the past, there were the Constitutional Government Promotion Association and the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association. Both of these associations were convened by the government, and I participated in them. All parties also exchanged opinions."</p>
<p>"This time, the Political Consultative Conference also discussed the constitutional draft. After exchanging opinions, several principles have been passed. The Constitutional Drafting Committee, which is about to be convened, will further discuss these passed principles. I believe that this review committee will have results quickly. Therefore, in terms of realizing democracy and implementing constitutional government, I think it is quite optimistic." He lit a cigarette, took two puffs, and fully revealed his confident expression.</p>
<p>"Generally speaking, from the passage of the constitution to the formation of a government based on the constitution, this so-called transitional period will not be too short. I think if the government reorganization is completed and all parties can unite sincerely and show results in promoting democracy, then peaceful unification is very hopeful, and there will be no more civil wars."</p>
<p>"I very much recognize that the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, the Youth Party, and the Democratic League all have a common understanding, that is, they must unite, unify, democratize, and achieve peace. Since the common understanding of all parties is the same, then after the government is reorganized, there will be relatively satisfactory results for all parties." His views on this aspect seemed to have come to a small conclusion, and his focus immediately shifted to the point of nationalizing the army.</p>
<p>"Regarding the issue of the nationalization of the army, all parties are very concerned, and international friends are also very concerned about this and are very enthusiastic in helping. On this issue, the CCP has the same understanding as other parties, that is to say, China needs a large-scale reduction in troops because the country's total budget for this year, the military expenditure accounts for almost half. If it is not a large-scale reorganization and reduction, then the country's construction and finance will encounter difficulties. Therefore, on this issue, I hope that the CCP can fulfill its promise to temporarily reduce the army to twenty divisions. Then, it will not be difficult to initially solve the problem and achieve the goal of nationalizing the army."</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Zuo ended his speech in a solemn and sharp tone. He said: "This time, the reorganization of the government, the convening of the National Assembly, and how the quotas of all parties will be allocated, as long as everyone attaches great importance to the interests of the country and the interests of the people, and clearly understands the international environment, then these problems will not be difficult to solve..." Then, he expressed his usual views on the order of importance of national, people's, and party interests.</p>
<p>At the time of departure, he told me that he was preparing to publish a "China Times," which could be published as early as March. He himself may visit Nanjing, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places within a month to consolidate and connect the youth party headquarters in various places that have lost contact for eight years.</p>
<h3>British Cruiser with Distinguished War Record Captain Warn Invites Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The British cruiser "Euryalus" sailed to Shanghai from Hong Kong ten days ago to replace the flagship "Belfast." Captain Warn specially invited Chinese and foreign reporters from this city to visit at 2:00 PM yesterday. The ship's name comes from three famous Euryalus figures in ancient times, all of whom were known for their heroic deeds. This ship bearing its name is the fifth. It went to sea for combat in June 1941 and is a Dido-class 5,500-ton light cruiser, equipped with eight 5.25-inch caliber cannons, twelve anti-aircraft guns, seventeen machine guns, and three torpedoes. Each torpedo weighs one and a half tons, and sailors specially opened the tubes and pulled them out for visitors to inspect. From September 1941 to March 1942, the ship performed great deeds in the Mediterranean. Under continuous bombing by German aircraft, it supplied Malta with food and ammunition. One battle with the powerful Italian fleet resulted in one of the most glorious battles in British naval history. In December 1944, it sailed to the Far East and joined the British Pacific Fleet for combat, becoming one of the first warships to attack the southern overseas islands of Japan, and then attacked the Japanese mainland.</p>
<p>The ship can carry more than 600 officers and soldiers. During wartime, there was no time to take care of the interior, so it is currently repairing and cleaning machinery and the hull. After several weeks, once the relief ship arrives, it will sail to Hong Kong or Japan.</p>

<h3>Major Speculators Squeeze the Market, Gold Shops Absorb Supply Gold Prices Soar, Once Exceeding 130,000 Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, gold prices initially appeared weak due to low quotations from the wartime capital, but major speculators re-engaged in a market squeeze, resulting in aggressive purchases by northern merchants and gold shops. Those short on contracts became visibly panicked. After initially falling, a sharp rebound occurred as a short squeeze took hold. Under the leadership of major speculators, buying momentum surged. The market opened lower at 1.19 million, but bank sales continued. The price fell below 1.16 million, which the gold shops took advantage of to absorb supply and maintain prices. Major speculators in the industry saw an opportunity and coordinated to push prices up, quickly breaking through the 1.2 million mark again. Later, the market briefly retreated from above 1.23 million to 1.197 million, but with the short squeeze in full swing, northern merchants aggressively bought, and the price rose again to above 1.27 million before slightly receding. The morning session closed at 1.246 million, up 26,000 from the previous close. In the afternoon, the spot price initially fell slightly from 1.265 million to around 1.24 million, but as next-day delivery transactions gradually increased, various buy rumors arose due to the Soviet army's delayed withdrawal from the Northeast. Sentiment was extraordinarily strong, and industry participants rushed to buy, pushing the price from 1.265 million to around 1.322 million. Finally, it hovered around the 1.3 million mark. Gold ornaments were priced as high as 140,000, silver 1,200, and silver coins 730 yuan. Illegal exchange rates were slightly higher due to tight money supply, ranging from 0.12 to 0.14.</p>
<p>The initial exchange rate for US dollars was 1,680 yuan, but it slightly declined to 1,650 yuan following the gold market. As gold prices rebounded, arbitrage buying surged, rising to 1,760 yuan. It hovered around 1,730 yuan at noon and rose to 1,780 yuan in the afternoon, eventually closing at 1,770 yuan. The difference was pulled to above 730, entirely passive due to a lack of speculative activity. Hong Kong dollars were slightly stronger after initially being flat. Old notes rose by 10 yuan, and new notes by 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Although There Was Some Profit-Taking, Stock Prices Continued to Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks continued to advance yesterday with great momentum. Yongsha opened at 2,550 yuan, then fluctuated from 2,730 yuan to 2,660 yuan, and then rose to 2,820 yuan in the morning. The high price led to profit-taking, and it fell back to 2,730 yuan at noon. A tall tree attracts the wind, and high prices were difficult to sustain. Maya rose from 1,850 yuan to 2,170 yuan, and closed at 2,100 yuan at noon. Jingfu failed to break through the 14 yuan mark. Overall, Yongsha rose by 170 yuan, Maya by 150 yuan, and Xinhuo by 120 yuan compared to the previous close. The "Three Small" rose by 9 to 12 yuan, while the rise of unpopular stocks was also extremely sharp.</p>
<p>After foreign stocks rose, old bulls sold off. Stock firms were unable to support further price increases due to tight money supply, causing prices to retreat slightly from their highs. Yisha reached a high of 6,900 yuan, Jardine Matheson 16,500 yuan, and British United 9,000 yuan, all falling back. At noon, Yisha, Jardine Matheson, Yinglian, and other popular stocks had risen by 15% to 20% compared to the previous day, but selling orders were more prevalent.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Stable</h3>
<p>Government bonds were initially flat but then strengthened, although major players gradually shifted their attention to other markets. The performance was not as eye-catching as gold and stocks. Apart from Class C bonds, high prices for miscellaneous brands proved unsustainable. The highest price was 2,370 yuan, and the lowest was 2,140 yuan. The afternoon close was 2,270 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Classes A and B rose by 60 yuan, Class C by 50 yuan, Class D by 100 yuan, and Class E by 30 yuan. The price differences slightly narrowed.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Rice prices are rising due to the continuous increase in gold prices, causing sellers to be very firm. Inland prices are also rising, leading to further increases. Japonica rice rose by another 600-700 yuan, and Xiangu Baiyuan skyrocketed by 1,000 yuan. Flour sales were active, rising by another 400 yuan. The oil market also experienced soaring prices due to demand exceeding supply, rising by over 4,000 yuan. Soybeans also increased by 300-500 yuan. However, raw peanuts saw little change. Soybean cake was slightly firm, rising by 200-300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Demand Exceeds Supply All Brands Set New Prices</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to see strong price increases yesterday. As weaving factories gradually resumed operations, the demand for raw materials was very strong. Dealers firmly held onto their stocks, as the purchases made by colleagues from the textile and construction company in the past two days were not enough to satisfy their appetite. This led to a situation where demand exceeded supply. Medium and small-sized 20-count yarns were particularly strong. Brands such as Xing Shi and Feima have reached 720,000, a huge increase of 60,000 from the previous day. The 20-count Lanfeng saw transactions at 780,000, also up 40,000. The prices of other coarse yarns and threads were also rising. The situation was extremely urgent, and all brands reached new highs. Textile and construction company prices for 20-count and below remained the same as the previous day, but fine yarns were raised again.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Demand Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading remained active yesterday. The market continued to be firm as factories had strong demand, mainly for fine-grade cotton. American cotton (Midelin) was delivered to factories for 78,000 to 80,000 yuan, and Huoji cotton was delivered to warehouses for 53,000 to 55,000 yuan, each rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Woollen Fabric Red List Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Woollen fabric red lists were mostly released by various firms yesterday. Due to various environmental factors and the high closing prices last December, all of them rose sharply. Summer goods such as Paristine, Feather Yarn Cloth, Wan Lieding, Yuancang Serge, Huar Dunn, and Light Gray Thin Flower Cloth were the most prominent. The red list prices for western suit linings such as French Xichen, Black Charcoal lining, Fancy Cloth Sleeve Lining Silk, and Mercerized Feather Yarn Soft lining were also higher than in the past. Only outdated goods such as overcoat cloth, riding breeches cloth, Tuosijin, and long-haired velvet were quoted at lower prices.</p>
<h3>Coal Dust Rises in Price: Rumor Spreads of Goods Confiscated at Station; Discount Coal Sales to Begin Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The initial opening of coal dust [market] saw factories gradually expand their intake. All felt that the actual goods on the market were insufficient, so prices were very tight. Later, it was heard that fellow businesses had purchased a large amount of coal dust, about thirty to forty cars, from Bengbu, Nanjing, and other places. Although they have now arrived in Shanghai, they were temporarily confiscated at the Shanghai Maigen Road Station for unknown reasons, causing a commotion in the market and rising prices. White coal dust and hand-operated coal ball manufacturers are still actively searching, but the market is short on goods, and the price continues to rise. The downward trend of white coal chunks is difficult to reverse, and the retail of white coal nuggets remains strong, with stable prices.</p>
<p>In other news, the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to prepare for the allocation of coal for citizens' cooking, ordered the coal and coal ball industry associations to organize a "People's Livelihood Coal Management Office." Its first batch of discount sales is scheduled to begin tomorrow (the 10th) in the Xujiahui district. It stipulates that each household holding a December 1945 electricity bill can purchase 50 jin of Shanxi anthracite small and medium-sized coal at 40 yuan per jin. The discount sales locations are: (1) 489 Ladu Road, (2) 224 Stesdelang Road, (3) 1 Jiaxiyi Road.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Rises by 30%: Textile Construction Company Also Increases Prices</h3>
<p>After the Spring Festival holiday, private dyeing and weaving factories had generally completed preparations for factory equipment. However, due to the extremely weak inventory of grey cloth, they fully expected the China Textile Construction Company to universally open sales of cotton cloth to registered member manufacturers in order to reduce production costs. However, the China Textile Construction Company has recently opened sales of a small amount of bleached cloth, grey light twill, yuan light twill, etc., at prices higher than the market. As a result, market cloth prices have increased by about 30% compared to the previous year. Therefore, if the China Textile Construction Company continues to delay opening sales of grey cloth, it will not only stimulate cloth price increases and affect manufacturers, but also affect the lives of workers. It is reported that the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association plans to apply to the company to quickly open sales of grey cloth.</p>
<p>In other news, the China Textile Construction Company yesterday announced prices for yuan light twill and bleached cloth. Here are the recorded cloth prices: yuan light twill 30,000 yuan, grey light twill 28,000 yuan, camel grey twill 28,000 yuan, bleached cloth 51,000 yuan. The opening price of bleached cloth is more than 10% higher than comparable products on the market.</p>
<h3>Hardware Transactions Gradually Become Active</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the hardware business on the 6th, purchases by factories on this street have gradually become active. Goods such as black iron sheet, drawn wire, foreign yuan, etc., have all been traded, and the market is about 20% better than at the end of last month. As for customer traffic, it still remains to be seen.</p>

<h3>Nanjing Municipal Government Rescues Out-of-School Children: Plans to Build Elementary School Buildings, Submitting a Request to the Executive Yuan for a Special Appropriation of 1.5 Billion</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 8th] Many elementary and middle school buildings in Nanjing were damaged during the war, and many that were not destroyed are currently occupied by military agencies. According to the current situation, school-age children cannot be accommodated. After the return to the capital, the number of school-age children will inevitably increase. In order to rescue out-of-school children and enable them to receive universal education, the municipal government has formulated a plan to submit a request to the Executive Yuan for a special appropriation of 1.5 billion to build elementary school buildings.</p>
<h3>Recent News on School Buildings in the Capital: Most Schools at All Levels Have Not Resumed Classes at Their Original Sites</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the construction and revitalization of education is an urgent matter. In the capital's education, recovery depends on funding, and school buildings are also a prerequisite. The situation of school buildings at all levels is briefly described below:</p>
<p>Higher Education</p>
<p>Regarding the school buildings of colleges and universities of higher education: (1) Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences in Donggua City, Nanjing, served as a refugee area for Nanjing citizens during the war, accommodating many refugees, especially women. During the atrocities committed by enemy troops entering Nanjing, the college relied on the assistance of Western professors staying in Nanjing to protect the chastity of many women. Although inhabited by refugees, the buildings were fortunately preserved after the war. The school is currently running a middle school, and the university can resume after the summer. (2) The Ginling University school building in Gulou is currently borrowed by the Temporary University Preparatory Class. It will be returned after the Temporary University Preparatory Class concludes in the summer, and Ginling University can also resume school after the summer. (3) Central University at Sipailou, Chengxian Street, has recovered a portion of the main building from military and political agencies. Negotiations are currently underway to transfer the buildings of the Agricultural College of Central University in Sanpailou, and they will be recovered soon. Currently, the Temporary University Preparatory Class is borrowing the gymnasium of Central University for office and classroom use on a limited basis. The class will end in the summer, and Central University will also resume school after the summer.</p>
<p>Secondary Education</p>
<p>The school buildings of private schools, such as Zhongying, Yuqun, Huiwen, Mingde, Yecheng, Ginling Girls' High School, and Zhonghua Girls' High School, were not destroyed. Anfeng and Dongfang were partially destroyed. Zhongnan was largely destroyed. Municipal schools, such as the Municipal Normal School building at the porridge factory outside the South Gate, were completely destroyed, and the Second Middle School building in Zizhu Forest was demolished. Therefore, as a temporary measure, many schools are borrowing school buildings to hold classes. For example, Municipal First Middle School has been relocated to Baixia Road (the original buildings on Fuxi Street are being negotiated for recovery and will soon be returned to the original school; all the buildings on Baixia Road are used as offices by the Capital District Court). At the same time, a branch school will be established in the former Shengping Bridge Elementary School (Zhengshi Middle School has been merged into it). Second Middle School is borrowing Gulou Elementary School. Third Middle School Vocational School is holding classes in the Wesley Church on Shengzhou Road. Municipal Girls' High School is located in the former Duliang Ting Elementary School in Xujia Lane. As for the three National Temporary Middle Schools, they are located in Longpanli, Sanmaogong, and Zhuqiao; the second branch of the Temporary Middle School is located in the Elementary School affiliated to Nanjing Middle School at the pre-war Menlian Bridge. In addition, the newly established private Shicheng Middle School is located in the Chengzhong Assembly Hall in Guyilang.</p>
<p>Elementary Education</p>
<p>Municipal elementary school buildings, such as those in Gaojing, Hanximen, Nanchang Road, Cuiba Lane, Cangding, Chuanban Lane, Anpin Street, Malu Street, Huaiqing Bridge, Youfuxi Street, Xiangpu Camp, Central Road, New Vegetable Market, Peijia Bridge, Xingzhong Road, etc., have been either completely destroyed or largely damaged. Yixian Bridge Elementary School is used by the Children's Relief Home. In addition, the school buildings of Yanzi Rock, Xiaolingwei, Hanzhong Road, Jijia Zhuang, Cangbomen, Xinfu Er, Taiping Township, Baguazhou Elementary School, and the Maqun Xianhemen branches are all utilized as temples and charitable halls. Furthermore, the school buildings of Yang General Lane, Santiao Lane, and Huiyuan Street Elementary Schools are borrowed from other agencies or private residences. Those that are completely rented from civilian houses include the school buildings of Bafutang, Yanliaofang, Madao Street, Yuhua Road, Xuanwu Gate, Yanzhi Lane, Ertiao Lane, Mingyang Street, Yicang Lane, Fenghuang Street, Shuangzha, Erbanqiao, Gaogangli, Qilizhou, Maqun, Xianhemen, Chengshanfang, Bianying, Chuanban Lane, Maigaoqiao, Lotus Pond, and Mochou Lake Elementary Schools. In addition, the school buildings of Dengfu Lane, Pingji Street, Jinwan Lane, and Sanpailou Elementary Schools were previously borrowed by other agencies and can be gradually recovered for school use. As for the municipal schools borrowing church halls to operate, the churches must take them back for their own use, and a deadline has been agreed upon for the city to return them. Generally speaking, all school building issues can be resolved entirely before the summer vacation. (Foolish)</p>

Director Zhu of the Education Bureau received them and replied that the issue of reopening Shenjiang Elementary School had been ordered to be handled accordingly, but regarding the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers of Zhijiang Elementary School, he only promised to consider it and respond later. The representatives felt that the new semester was about to begin and could not be delayed, and that if Zhijiang Elementary School could not be reinstated, the jobs of all elementary school teachers in the city would not be guaranteed.

<p>The Basketball Committee of the Shanghai Sports Association, in view of the fact that the old basketball rules (International Rules 1936 Edition) are too outdated and unsuitable for application, has decided to adopt the latest American rules. However, due to the urgent time, preparations are not enough, so players and referees have no basis for the game rules. Therefore, Zhou Jiaqi, the original translator of the basketball rules, was hired to re-translate them. The entire book is about to be completed and will be printed and published soon.</p>

<h3>Education Leads Politics</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Recently, I read Lin Han's educational thought, "Which Road Does Politics Take?" in "Ping Lun," and Mr. Da's "Is Education the Tail of Politics?" I feel that the arguments are pertinent and worthy of attention. Education and politics are inherently intertwined and cannot be separated. The ideals of education can only be realized through the power of politics; and the advancement of politics can only be effective through the power of education. Plato emphasized the relationship between education and politics in his "Republic." Many educators in Greece at that time were almost all practically engaged in politics, and the performance in politics coincided with the educational thought of that era. There were also many scholars who included education in politics, believing that politics itself is education. Politics is the affair of the people, and governance is management. Managing the affairs of the people is politics. To put it more progressively, politics contains the meaning of leadership and instruction. Subordinating the meaning of education to politics does not neglect education, but rather expands the connotation of education.</p>
<p>However, many people misunderstand these two aspects, believing that education inherently has no power, and politics determines all educational effects. Their mistake lies in neglecting the meaning of education, which has fundamentally shaken people's belief in education. They feel that politics has unlimited power, and they have seen that in many countries, education has long lost its decisive role and simply follows politics. Like the education of the three major aggressor countries in the past, Germany, Japan, and Italy, it showed a very strong fascist political color everywhere. If their education were to depart from the political concepts of fascist rule, it would have no other meaning at all. Indeed, education, under certain circumstances, is often used by ambitious politicians, because adding a pleasing educational coat to the outside of extremely despicable politics can deceive people everywhere. Education is a form of cultural flower, and it is often regarded as a "political cover." It is clearly a fascist culture of aggression, but ambitious politicians can add the appealing phrase "military national education." It seems that there is a reason to say that politics determines all the effects of education.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from a factual perspective, the power of politics is, after all, greater than that of education. Sometimes, without the power of politics, education simply becomes a piece of empty paper. In modern European and American advanced countries, the implementation of their education relies heavily on the power of politics. Their constitutions stipulate the goals and ideals of educational implementation, and their politics also reflect their educational goals and ideals. Even in this situation, we can only say that education and politics are closely related, or, to put it more thoroughly, their politics have implemented their educational thoughts; and we can never say that their education follows politics. Take the United States as an example. Their politics is a progressive democratic politics of "government of the people, by the people, and for the people," but their democratic thought was conceived in education. As Professor Kilpatrick said: "Good politics must be the result of the implementation of correct educational thought, without correctness." At first glance, this seems to be defending education, but it is not entirely true. Education represents a central idea of politics. Without the leadership of a central idea, politics is inevitably blind.</p>
<p>Now, the aggressor countries have been defeated by the United Nations, who fought to defend world peace. In today's world, where public reason triumphs over might and justice triumphs over hegemony, we no longer hope that people will misunderstand the role of education. Education should lead politics forward with correct central ideas, so that politics can have a way, and the country can have a way. Of course, in a certain sense, we cannot deny that politics has its power. However, we can assert that the power of politics must be exerted under the condition that it can reflect and express educational thought.</p>
<p>Currently, the call for implementing constitutional government and democratic politics is shaking the whole country. First of all, we hope that everyone will recognize the meaning of education, establish the thought of true democratic education, and implement the true purpose of democratic education. Democratic politics will never use education as a cover, and democratic politics must accept progressive educational thought as the foundation of its theory. Democratic thought in education should be the highest leadership of democratic spirit in politics, and the democratic spirit in politics is entirely a reflection of democratic thought in education. In this way, education and politics are interconnected, and the construction of democratic countries can lay a solid foundation.</p>
<p>A true educator must be a rational thinker and a clear-headed practitioner. If those engaged in politics can grasp the core of his thought and reflect it in politics and express it in politics, it is equivalent to building a bridge between theory and practice.</p>
<p>Education is by no means an appendage of politics, and education is not the tail of politics. Education truly has the great role of leading politics. As for why education needs the power of politics to have significant effects, we must recognize that this is all a means, a method. The purpose of education, the ideals of education, undoubtedly still lie in education itself. In any case, education should lead politics.</p>

<h3>Interesting Anecdotes of the Labor Movement</h3>
<p>— Mao Shukui</p>
<p>Over two thousand eight hundred employees of the electric company, since the beginning of their slowdown strike, have gathered at the Yangshupu Power Plant. On January 31st, around 4 p.m., a "Wife Retrieval Group" of over a hundred people suddenly appeared, seeking to take their "husbands" home. About one-tenth of them were women, but when asked for the names of the "husbands" they sought, they were all dumbfounded, only saying, "Ask the group leader."</p>
<p>When the labor strike in the city's barbering industry began to spread, the Western District's tea-barber shops continued to operate as usual. After being discovered by the union's patrol team, they gathered dozens of workers and stormed into the shop, inviting them to join the strike. Instantly, all the employees were rushed away. At that time, the shop was full of guests, who, seeing the bad situation, all rushed out with disheveled hair. One young woman, whose perm was not yet finished, had her hair still hanging from the machine. She couldn't break free urgently and was afraid of electric shock, so she dared not move haphazardly. She was in a state of embarrassment and anxiety, and she shouted for help. By the time the shop owner returned to release her, more than half of her hair was burnt.</p>
<p>Most of the labor disputes that occurred this time involved labor demanding money from capital. However, the Cantonese cuisine workers uniquely demanded that the capitalists not demand money from the labor. The reason is that the wine and food workers have never had much in the way of salary or stipend, relying solely on tips and gratuities. Because tip income is quite generous, the capitalists also want to take a share, even without transparency, or even with private deductions. Therefore, the workers collectively shouted, "The tips are ours!"</p>
<p>On Lunar New Year's Eve, the nineteen arrested representatives of the electric company workers were released on bail after a petition by all the workers of the factory. At 10 p.m., Zhang Zhenyuan, Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, filled in the names of ten temporary representatives on the bail bond. The first name was Ding Buyun, and the last name was Qi Denggao. Since the next day was the Lunar New Year's Day, it could truly be called an auspicious omen. Therefore, the news reporters who followed to interview on empty stomachs were all overjoyed and refreshed, and they all said, "Section Chief Zhang has worked hard and made great achievements. Next year, his career will be prosperous, and he will rise steadily, step by step, to higher positions."</p>
<p>When the Four Thousand Unemployed Workers of sixty-two units including the Fourth District Mechanical Industry Union, petitioned the Municipal Government, Zhou Xuexiang, the representative of the General Labor Union, and Yue Banfu of the Unemployed Workers Relief Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to the Holy Trinity Church Square in the workers' rest area to explain to all the workers. The workers raised various requests, asking for answers, for two hours. Later, Zhao was left as a guarantee, while Zhou went to the Economic Bureau to ask for instructions. Zhou left and never returned, so Zhao continued to be detained for more than an hour before he could escape. Gasping for breath, he told reporters, "Mr. Zhou used a golden cicada sloughing off its shell, using me as collateral."</p>

<h3>Introducing Our Culture to the Outside World</h3>
<p>— Zhou Tianshou</p>
<p>——To the Comrades of Woodcuts</p>
<p>Zamenhof exhausted his efforts to create Esperanto, considered to have adopted the common points of various national languages. However, this so-called Esperanto is only a newly created language, and cannot be understood at a glance by the world. Otherwise, even though I don't understand Mayakovsky's Russian original version of "Shout," I wouldn't have to rely solely on Wan Shisi's translation from Esperanto. But similarly, I don't understand German, but I can understand the bitterness of the working masses under the high pressure of the fascist dictatorship in Germany from Käthe Kollwitz's prints such as "Unemployment," "The Children are Hungry," and "Death and the Woman." I can't read Belgian, but I can also see from Masereel's "My Confession" and "The Pursuit of Light" how the Belgian petty bourgeoisie lives in the pursuit of beautiful ideals, how uneasy they are with the status quo, and how they yearn for contemplation!</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that this is the real world language.</p>
<p>Westerners often despise us because they don't understand us, which leads to misrepresentation. Under their uneven lenses, what strange images do our culture, life, and ideological trends present! However, in the 20th century, are we still asking Westerners to infer Oriental civilization from Marco Polo's Travels in the East, in the hope of understanding us?</p>
<p>However, there are too few books that can be directly studied. When they read Gleb's "New China," they run to China only to be driven away. Other reports made by so-called China experts mostly distort the facts under isolated emotions. Introducing our culture to the outside world, who says it's not an urgent task?</p>
<p>How to introduce it? Translating various domestic masterpieces into Western languages ​​is of course indispensable, but while busy with the translation of Chinese works, please don't forget that woodcuts are a useful propaganda tool. It has no national boundaries, is a real "world language" that makes people understand at a glance. It is with simple colors, simple pictures, diverse descriptions, nakedly, unreservedly, and universally telling everything about us to all people who do not understand Chinese.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our woodcut art has caught up with international standards from being hasty and childish. In the diligent study and ardent criticism of comrades, the creation of national forms has also had an accurate definition.</p>
<p>Work hard, comrades of woodcuts, work with your love for the motherland, and introduce our culture to the outside world.</p>

<h3>New Language for Rock-Paper-Scissors</h3>
<p>— Lu Shanxiong</p>
<p>(1) Unifying the country (6) The army rises up bravely</p>
<p>(2) Two-party belief (7) The July 7th Resistance</p>
<p>(3) The Three Principles of the People (8) Eight years of victory</p>
<p>(4) Exercising four powers (9) Saving our country</p>
<p>(5) The Five-Power Constitution (10) The whole country rejoices</p>
<p>The other day, I went to a friend's house for a New Year's dinner. When the wine was strong, there was rock-paper-scissors game. Seeing that the boxing terms used by several old people were all felt to be outdated, I wrote these new words for the first New Year's dinner after the victory, as a permanent memorial.</p>

<h3>The Sanjiang Public Association Serves Overseas Chinese: Voluntarily Forwarding Mail Between China and the United States</h3>
<p>The Sanjiang Public Association in New York, USA, is an organization jointly organized by overseas Chinese from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and the Yangtze River Basin. In the past, due to traffic congestion, it was inconvenient to communicate with each other. Overseas Chinese in the United States were deeply concerned about their families in China. In addition, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, fellow villagers had been away from their hometowns for many years, and their families moved, and their addresses often changed. Home letters sent from the United States could not be delivered and were returned, resulting in a break in contact. In order to facilitate mutual communication, the Association hereby announces that all fellow villagers in China who have relatives and friends in the United States should write to the following address, and the Chinese name of the recipient must be written on the envelope for voluntary delivery. If the letter cannot be delivered, the Association will also explain the reasons and reply, so as to avoid mutual distrust. This is specially announced.
