<h3>滬上會談空氣融洽　業已獲得初步諒解　中共聲明并不影響洽商</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府政協代表，昨與中共，民盟，青年黨，及社會賢達各代表首次交換意見，情緒極爲融洽，談判之門業已打開，各方均表示願意商量。延安之廣播發表後，各代表亦已加以檢討，僉認爲雙方均係要求停戰，恢復和平，精神上初無二致，即有距離，亦並非甚大。且延安係要求恢復一月十三日之駐軍狀態，則事實上殊未始不可視爲一種「還價」性質，因提出要求與所謂全面破裂，究亦有本質上之不同也。據記者所知，昨日之會談已得頗可告慰國人之成績，政府八項辦法中，已有三四項獲得初步之諒解。</p>
<p>昨日上午時，第三方面各代表張君勱，胡政之，曾琦，左舜生，陳啓天，羅隆基，黃炎培，章伯鈞，楊永浚，余家菊等，曾在海格路吳鐵城氏寓所與政府方面三代表交換意見，午間，第三方面代表宴政府及中共雙方代表於範園，周恩來偕李維漢陳家康出席。下午五時，政府代表與各黨各派及社會賢達代表皆至思南路周恩來寓所賡續會談，晚七時半，政府代表宴各代表，仍在吳公館。</p>
<p>昨日交換意見時，中共曾複述延安所廣播之意見。聞政府某代表因中共所要求者爲恢復一月十三日之軍事狀態，曾笑謂：「然則君等將退出東北地區乎？」然正如某一在座代表所言，闊別數月，一旦重見，逐陪見親密，故席上仍談笑風生，逸興遇飛。</p>
<p>中共方面繼提出關於商談方式之「意見」（中共代表聲明此僅「意見」而非「主張」），謂方式有三：（一）「停談」，即先停戰後判談；（二）「談停戰」，即先作初步商談，討論停戰辦法，然後停戰，停戰後再談其他問題；（三）「談停」，即先談妥後再停戰。當時各代表之意見，均以爲「停談」爲事實上所不能辦到；「談停」則所費時間太長；不如「談停談」是妥。而既採取此「談停談」方式，則第一個「談」字要談到比較簡單，時間務求其短，俾停戰能儘早實現，而其他細節，則在停戰後再談。</p>
<p>雷震今晚返京　報告會談情形</p>
<p>惟對此第一「談」之範圍，各方面之意見當略有出入，逐由羅隆基黃炎培二氏，先將此談內容加以研究。</p>
<p>至昨日會談時政府方面所表示之意見，則爲此來係專誠邀請中共及第三方面各代表赴京商談，在滬不妨先行交換意見，但並不作爲正式商談。</p>
<p>惟據記者獲悉「談停談」中之第一部份的「談」，可能在上海即行開始。</p>
<p>今日上午由各代表自由交換意見，並無集會，中午由青年黨宴各代表；下午四時，民主社會黨舉行招待茶會；五時在盧會談；晚由中共宴各代表。</p>
<p>據一般情形觀察，昨日會談時，各代表對延安所發廣播，似並未以極緊張之情緒視之，因中共前曾宣佈，若國軍進攻張垣，中共即認爲全面分裂，而昨日延安仍係提出要求，而並未宣佈全面破裂也。又雷震可能於今晚返京，報告此二日來會談情形。</p>
<p>據吳秘書長鐵城對記者談，目前各地仍有軍事衝突，要和平必須停戰，要停戰能獲得有效的保證，不重蹈以往覆轍，即必須商談有效的停戰辦法，而後始能實現全面永久和平。</p>
<p>銅嗣說明：第三方面昨午設宴範園，國共雙方代表叙首一堂，情緒融洽，圖示出席（政府代表）吳鐵城·邵力子·雷震，（青年黨代表）陳啓天·曾琦·左舜生·楊永浚·金家菊·李璜，（民主同盟代表）張君勱·黃炎培·羅隆基·沈鈞儒·章伯鈞·蔣勻田，（中共代表）周恩來·李維漢·陳家康·華岡，首次合影。（中國社攝）</p>
<h3>京中間人士希望　雙方不再提條件</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕政治重心日來已自京移滬，司徒大使又於今日離京，故此間活動除民盟與社會賢達數氏之活動外，接觸甚少，十八日上午十時，莫德惠·繆嘉銘·錢新之·偕訪梁漱溟，共產黨王炳南旋亦至，王向梁等報告共黨十七日發表聲明事。正談話間，中宣部彭部長亦至，王報告畢，即辭退。彭往晤梁係因以民盟前向中宣部所提對中央社消息提抗議事有所解釋，王去後，梁等五人即就共產黨聲明予以研究，梁等並提出意見，希望國共雙方最好不再提任何條件，並盼不以條件爲商談前提，彭氏亦贊同此意，惟彭認爲政府文告中之八項意見，並非條件而爲進行中之程序。彭旋先辭去，餘四人即於十一時至梅園新村訪董必武，對適所研究之意見，即希望雙方互不提條件，不堅持意見，請董將此意立即轉達延安及在滬之周恩來，談至十二時始出。下午四時梁·莫·錢·繆四人再聯袂赴孫科院長私邸傳達此意，並盼孫轉達最髙當局，孫亦表同意，至六時始出。旋梁氏返寓後，即將此項意見以長途電話通知上海第三方面人士。又孫科亦派其私人代表某氏，於十時乘夜車赴滬，代表孫向第三方面人士保持接觸的。</p>

<h3>共黨如希望統一　應接受主席提示</h3>
<p>紐約時報評中國時局</p>
<p>〔本報特派員紐約十八日電〕「紐約時報」今日撰文稱：蔣主席於張家口之捷後所提之和解辦法，可以試驗中國共產黨究竟共產黨之成份多於中國人之成份，抑係中國人之成份多於共產黨之成份。蔣主度所最企望者，無疑爲一統一之中國，但共產黨是否希望如此，不無若干疑問。中國共產黨領袖中，有人與蘇聯以外各國之共產黨相同，正在進行分裂國家之工作，但同時在共產黨統治下確有許多中國人具備政治民主份子之條件。「如共產黨所最關心者爲在華北與東北設立共產政體，則彼等將不注意蔣主席之八項建議。如彼等希望形成統一之中國而使民主邁進，則可能予以接受。問題乃在彼等究竟共產黨之成份多於中國人之成份，抑係中國人成份多於共產黨之成份」也。</p>

<h3>中共發展聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕據新華社延安十七日電，甲，中國共產黨中央委員會今日發表對時局聲明如下：「本黨於抗日戰爭結束以後，即從事與國民黨領袖蔣介石合作，以實現國內和平促進民主的艱巨努力，爲此，並曾不惜再三讓步。去年八月本黨主席毛澤東親赴重慶談判四十餘日，並實行自浙江，蘇南，皖南，湖南，鄂南，豫西撤退抗日有功之軍隊。以此第一次讓步獲得國共會談紀要的簽訂。不幸會談紀要公佈次日，蔣主席即因得美國軍事援助，發出所謂「剿匪」手令，致悲慘的內戰，仍蔓延全國達三月之久。蔣介石雖如此背信，美政府雖如此不義，本黨仍繼續和平努力，卒於本年一月十日由國共美三方共同簽署停戰命令，規定一月十三日後，全國停止一切軍事衝突與軍事調動，並允蔣介石在停戰前提下得派五個軍至東北，是爲本黨第二次之讓步。一月三十一日，中國各主要黨派與社會賢達代表所組成之政治協商會議，以全體一致通過五項決議，於此本黨又作了第三次讓步，尤以對所謂國大舊代表問題之讓步，爲最重要。此時國方在東北，熱河，湖北，廣東等地，已破壞停戰令，繼續軍事進攻，在重慶又發生破壞政協決議的較塲口慘案與新華日報慘案，但本黨又作第四次讓步，於二月二十五日與國美雙方簽署了絕端委曲求全之整軍方案，乃蔣方的軍事進攻，軍事調動，與政治反動竟變本加厲。國民黨二中全會公開要求推翻停戰令，政協決議，與整軍方案，而美國對蔣方的軍事援助，亦較赫爾利時期更甚。三月二十七日中共作第五次讓步，允許東北維持當時的，而已非一月十三日的狀况。但此項協定，雖亦由國共美三方正式簽字，國方却立即予以澈底破壞，在東北大舉進攻，而美方亦熱視無睹。六月間，中共在談判中，對各項問題，又作第六次讓步，乃蔣介石忽經過美旅游業提出五項無理要求，致一切商談，完全無效。此後，蔣軍在美方繼續大量援助之下，在全國各地恣意進攻，本黨爲表示第七次讓步，又允許在保證停戰條件下，參加關於改組政府的五人非正式會談，此種最低條件，竟亦爲蔣美兩方所拒絕。九月下旬，蔣軍開始攻擊張家口，本黨忍無可忍，乃正式通知此項進攻如不停止，即爲蔣方決心全面破裂的表示，而蔣美兩方的共同答覆，竟爲限期十日，接受蔣介石苛刻要求的最後通牃。本黨復作第八次讓步，僅要求蔣方取消進攻張家口，本黨即可參加三人軍事會談與五人政治會談。此項提議，終仍爲蔣美兩方拒絕，蔣軍並於本月十一日佔領張家口。上述一切事實，證明蔣美兩方所追求的只是中國民主運動的投降與消滅，只是蔣美兩方的軍事行動，固爲此目的，其一切所謂政治解決，和平調處，亦莫不爲此目的，不過以軍事行動相掩護，相調劑而已。只要他們不放棄此項目的，則本黨每一次仁至義盡的讓步，不但不能滿足他們的慾望，并且使他們認爲這是中國人民可欺的弱點，反而鼓動他們得寸進尺，非迫使本黨出場人民一切利益不止，非迫使本黨與中國民主運動完全消滅不止。因此蔣方現正在全國到處進攻，徵兵徵糧，摧殘民族民權民生並單獨下令如今所謂國民大會。美方亦堅不撤兵停援，在在表示他們毫無和平民主的意圖。在此種險惡局勢下，全國人民均望本黨堅持正義，力挽狂瀾，本黨亦誓爲人民的期望，竭智盡忠，奮鬥至底。近日若干第三方面人士正作挽救和平的最後努力，蔣介石爲了再一次矇蔽人民，以達到自己的野心，乃故意裝出和平姿態，於本月十六日宣佈其和平的八項條件。本黨認爲只要蔣介石在人民壓力之下，願意實行正式有效的和平，則本黨亦可不咎既往，重新協商。但在過去十四個月中，任何莊嚴的命令諾言和保證，既可任意撕毀，則今日的協議，明日又成廢紙；今日有五項八項要求，明日又可有五十項八十項的要求，本黨爲不忍再使我痛苦的人民，作接受此項可恥的欺騙，所以本黨沒有別的要求，衹要求首先恢復信義，今日信義的神聖標準爲何，這就是一月十日蔣介石，毛澤東，馬歇爾三人親自簽署的停戰令，與一月三十一日蔣介石和全體代表一致通過的政協決議。本黨爲表示最後最大讓步計，茲特鄭重聲明：今日一切會談，如欲期有真實結果，必須承認停戰政協兩協定的神聖效力；即承認恢復一月十三日國共雙方軍事位置爲一切軍事商談的準則；承認實行政協一切決議爲一切政治商談的準則。本黨認爲蔣介石與馬歇爾應該重視自己之信義和人格，沒有任何理由推翻自己所簽字的神聖協定。衹要他們有這種最低限度的誠意，本黨一定繼續與他們能力合作，以求和平的真正實現，民主的真正開始。本黨相信，正義終必戰勝一切，中國人民爭取和平民主的正義，無論將經何種艱難曲折，最後必能恢復停戰令與政協決議的全部效力。願與全國志士仁人共勉之。」</p>

下，倘「西方國家」的舉措，而不能得到當地人民的支持；則近東的動向實在是可慮的。　　伊朗問題又與近東問題結着深緣。阿塞而貝然人民的「自主」運動，其間關係的微妙，不言可知。在蘇聯高加索聯邦共和國下原有阿塞而貝然共和國的設置。伊朗北部阿塞而貝然人民的「自主」運動，不用說是受到蘇聯的支持的。由於此一運動的誕生，我們又看見有寇特許民族的自主運動出現在伊拉克。自從有了這些「自主」運動以來，伊朗與伊拉克便從此多事。今天伊朗北部的局勢依然如此，差幸出現在伊朗南部的叛亂，茲已宜告結束。據聯合社德黑蘭十七日電，伊朗政府曾發表官報稱：「伊朗南部土著反抗伊政府發生叛亂，己歷匝月，頃已同意停止叛亂。雙方已商妥增加國會法爾省議員人數，擴展鐵路綫至法爾省。赦免叛亂人民，及從法爾省居民挑選省府官負。」是則至少在伊朗南部，局勢似已趨於穩定。　　同時值得我們注意的是英外相貝文在國會所作有關伊朗局勢的聲明。他說：「英政府極願與伊政府樹立良好關係，英政府願見伊朗繁榮強盛獨立，不受外人干涉。蘇報紙及伊朗之廣播，嘗一再大事宣傳有關英官員之無稽謠言，英政府當設法將事實真相昭告伊期人民…英政府茲特聲明：在伊朗之英外交官或領事官，均奉令不得干涉該國內政，英政府對駐伊英官員並未違背此項訓令一點，深爲滿意。」其時有工黨議員雷特起立詢問貝文：是否能確定別個國家亦不曾干預伊朗內政，貝文笑而不答。可見關於伊朗局勢的關係複雜微妙。　　固然從一個較遠的角度來看，近東的激盪不安是世界激盪不安的一個縮影。然而近東從近代歷史開始以來，即爲列強角逐之戰。柏林報達鐵路的夢，促成了第一次世界大戰的爆發，「向東推進」的傳統政策又促起了第二次世界大戰。爲了世界的持久和平，近東的激盪不安不能讓它持續下去。</h3>

<p>耕者有其田　綏靖區域首先實行　農民地主均有利　蕭錚暢談土地改革前途　　〔本報南京十八日電〕中團土地制度之改革的時機業已成熟，記者爲明瞭此一重大改革的實情起見，特走訪中國地政學會理事長蕭鋒氏，承吿以土地改革實爲中國建立新農業制度之基礎，亦爲實行工業化之前提，本會歴年呼籲，頗得朝野有識人士之質許，國際學者亦共認中國必須改革封建的地主制度，使農民獲得生活上之改良，中國經濟方能趨於繁榮進步。復員後，本會鑒於種種經濟和政治的因素，認爲實行農地改革之時機已至，因此主張立即採取措施，實行耕者有其田，本黨最高領袖及政府當軸亦頗贊許，惟以茲事體大，一切準備工作未臻完善，故僅准予先在綏整靖區域實行，本人奉命參加起草，經多次審議，現經國防最高委員會核議通過，將土地改革各點，除訂人綏靖區城施政綱領外，並特訂綏靖區域土地處理辦法，以爲施行準則。記者詢以該項辦法何以在綏靖區域首先實行，蕭謂此確有其客觀環境及價値，因綏靖區域如蘇北皖北豫北以及河北山東與東北各省，爲吾國之州著名麥作區，本宜爲大規模之經營，此次重經變亂，人口减少，尤以壯丁犧牲甚大，勞動力不足，其先天的條件即不宜於佃耕制度，故依照本辦法，推行耕者有其田，常甚順利，惟農民取得土地後。首須勸導其爲合作經營，農政當局及農民銀行尤須立即爲之準備耕牛農具種籽肥料等，以爲明年春耕之準備，本人曾向農行當局建議，除應與善後救濟總署商洽，將曳引機迅速運至各該區域，設站分租予谷合作農塲外，並應向美國定購大量曳引機及其附屬農具。運供各該區合作農塲之用。此次土地改革，使地主土地移歸農民所有，並使農民所領土地合作經營，成爲現代化之新式農塲，則中國新晨業制度即可於此開端，良以久經破壞之區城，飽經憂患之各該區農民，政府實有使其首先獲得農業救濟，儘先獲致經濟繁榮之必要也。至各區域地主，因本辦法之實行，使其已被非法分配實際上已經喪失之地權重行獲得補償，由中國農民銀行給予信用極爲穩固之土地債券，可分年向銀行收回地價，而無須再行負担田賦，因爲依照該辦法，此次被征收土地稅轉移於領地之農民負担，使地主嗣後可藉收回地價，轉投資於實業，成爲現代經濟制度下之企業，而於地主實亦有利。蕭氏說明此種辦法對地卞與農民利益均能兼顧之後，並以愉快語調表示其誠摯的期望及理想，盼望負責推行之中央及地方機構，能善體中央通過本辦法之深意，妥籌進行而使之迅速奏效，則此後推廣此一辦法及於令國，使農地改革之偉業能全部實現，則更爲全國農民同胞所祈禱也。局勢開朗迅謀急賑　蘇北難民總登記　流亡鎮江請求還鄕者日眾　　〔本報鎭江訊〕蘇寗分署近以蘇北局勢日漸明朗，爲辦理急賑力求迅速確實，特訂定施賑査放工作須知，幷修正難民登記表及領粉證式樣，在蘇北收復各區定期舉辦難民總登記，中聯總行總派在各地工作隊站之人員爲一單位，社會處及蘇北難民救濟會議曁地方政府等爲一單位，難民協會等團體爲一單位，組織三人小組（則每一小組由上述三單位各派一人），視工作需要，分成若干小組，執行複査工作，幷將難民標準規定：（一）因戰事流離在外，生活貧苦現無職業者，（二）流亡難民已有職業而收入低微，其直系親屬在三人以上，必須由其供給生活費用者，經査實於該戶之人口總數除去三人外，餘均得予救濟，（三）公敎人貝不在救濟範圍之例，但其收入低微，家屬確係流亡，生活貧苦者，得比照第二項辦理。　　〔本報南通訊〕善後救濟總署蘇寗分署通屬區工作隊，曁本一縣善後救濟協會以奉蘇寗分署令飭辦理通屬區各縣難民總登記，俾便統計，遵於本月十四日起開始登記，至二十日止，逾期槪不補登。至登記後是否有物資發放，須視物資有無多寡而定。　　〔本報鎭江訊〕蘇北各縣流亡此間難胞，以蘇北各縣相繼收復，爲早日還鄕，重整田園，近日來向各該縣善後救濟協會請求登記還鄉者日衆，茲將最近各縣善後救濟協會登記請求還鄕難民數字錄後：高郵二四〇八名，實應六二八一名，興化一六八二名，泗陽二九九〇名，阜寗二三五二名，邳縣三五九名，潔雲一〇五三名，東台三五〇名，鹽城一六七九名，泰縣一五〇名，膲寗二六七名，贛楡六九名，述陽一七八二名，南通十五名，宿遷一一九八名，淮安一二〇〇〇名，淮陰六九二一名。　　〔本報徐州訊〕救濟總署頃函蘇北難民救濟會議徐州辦事處，將有廿四大箱華物，即將起運來徐，配發醫療難民。股匪蔡部蠢動　縣長出發兜剿　　〔本報蘇州十八日電〕盤踞於蘇屬第三區光福鎭附近之股匪蔡浩公所部約二百人左右。配有輕重機槍及長短槍枝甚夥，近忽潛樹民主同盟社偽幟，頗有擴張勢力之企圖，本月十三日下午七時，蔡親率部屬數十人，潛入三區濱湖之塘村鄉，邀集該鄕鄕保長極盡煽惑之能事，並在蘇錫公路之要衝地帶大池鄉及陽山鄕兩處，擅設流動稅卡，向經過之貨車勒收路費，每輛二萬元，美其名曰保護費，現淸剿區方面除令逯縣長就近率部兜剿外，並已籌有對策。嘉定開徵所得稅　縣府借賦未邀準　　〔本報嘉定訊〕本縣江蘇區直接稅局南通分局嘉定査征所，近奉層峯令飭開徵三十四年度第一類營營利事業所得稅，茲悉）該所主任王永正氏，已與縣商會數度商討，並由南通分局調派大批稅務人員來嘉，着手開徵。　　〔又訊〕本縣臨參會，因縣政經費困難，致礙縣政推行，曾經第二次大會議決，向大戶預借田賦二億元，並呈請省府核示，茲悉省方以縣政經費困難，自係實情，　田賦開徵日期，業經規定，應加緊徵收，以裕財源，預借一節，浪費公物，易滋弊端，電飭不准。趙逆昭班　押解吳興　　縣府佈吿徵詢罪行　　〔本報吳興訊〕軍事漢奸趙昭班，前充長與國民兵團中校國附一，民國三十二年間，敵寇竄擾，縣府被迫西遷，趙節附敵，充任僞鴻橋區區長，僞陸軍軍部中校參議等職，並誘惑自衛隊叛變，投敵附逆，勝利後該趙逆竟混入第十七軍官訓練總隊，担任中隊長，經人密報二區專署後，於專員呈准中央將該趙逆昭班提解來湖，發押聽候偵訊，專　已佈吿人民，如有遭受該逆蹂躪之被害人，均可檢證申訴，以憑究辦。蘇州遣散復員兵　發放旅費退伍金　　〔本報蘇州十八日電〕國防部陸軍士兵蘇州復員站，以近自江西湖南台灣各省送抵復員士兵五百餘名，已集中蘇頃待命遣散，特定十九日下午一時假中山堂再度舉行發放第三四五六各批復員士兵之餉薪退伍金旅費等，俾早日就業或歸農，該站爲示鄭重計，特函邀各機關首長及地方公正人士出席　放。蘇州地價風波　臨參會與地籍處反臉　　〔本報蘇州十八日電〕〃本縣土地價格自經地藉處草率評定後，全縣人士以其非惟超過時値，更較二月前省府核定之契稅價格高漲達十倍之鉅，將米地稅啓徵，勢必大量加重人民負担，刦後社會實不勝肩荷，故前會　前請縣臨參會於十五日邀請地籍處副處長章子燾專員吳中藩舉行檢討會議，惟結果雙方不歡而散，十六十七兩日縣臨參會特會同區公所，召集全體鄕鎭長，徵詢意見，咸表示估價太高，一致要求更爲公允之評定，乃於十八日晨十時再邀地籍處舉行第二次檢討會議，縣臨參會根擄民意，商請地籍處重新估價，地籍處章副處長則答稱：評定地價，政府授權地政機關全權辦理，與臨參會無涉，參議員等聞言認爲藐視民意，紛紛拂袖而起，會塲發生軒然大波，後經多方折衝，始決定由地籍處提供評定此項估價之證據，臨參會則收集罪近賣買契據，彼此參酌以最正確之時値，再行評定新地價，會議至下午二時許始吿散會。湘省待救濟復興　經建協會請增農工商各項貸款　組經濟請願團晉京呼籲　　〔本報長沙訊〕湖南各界人士以本省災情慘重，爲喚起全國人士注意，集中力量，復興建設起見，特發起組織湖南省經濟建設協會，於六日舉行成立大會，公推張烱等廿五人爲理事，彭國鈞等七人爲監事，決議（一）請中央發還糧食庫券，增加各項建設專款。（二）請四聯總處增加農田水利貸款，工商礦貸款，土地改良貸款，糧食貸款，合作貸款。（三）組織經濟請願團，晋京請願。（四）設立湖南經濟年鑑編輯委員會，編輯湖南經濟年鑑，預定民國卅六年六月完成。（五）舉辦技術人才之調査登記介紹。（六）建設省府及各機關，儘量採用合作方式，完成湖南經濟建設。（七）建議中央，擴充普通農貸，卅六年度湘省配額增爲一百五十億元，由省級洽定貸款用途及分配。　建議中央，於本省建立重工業區。（九）建議建設廳，於濱湖各縣建立農倉。崑山組織義警隊　　〔本報崑山訊〕警局爲強化據力，業已決定籥設義勇警察隊，縣成立一大隊，每區設立一中隊，大隊長由局長兼任，中隊長由警分所長兼任，所有長警即就壯丁中抽選，俟訓練三個月後，分派服務。白·茆·閘　開放有困難　　〔本報當熟訊〕縣農會電省請求開放白茆閘宣洩河水，已吿刻不容緩，但迄今半月，猶未見立實施，以致田中積水無從開出，春熟未能播種，來歲春荒堪虞，而東唐，白茆，任陽，罟里，藕渠，蘇哭等鄉農田四十五萬畝，因積水而遭荒蕪，以每畝三萬元計，其損害數字相當龐大，最低限度估算，的達一百三十五億元以上。同時並悉該閘內外拋石工程，已至相當階段，倘一旦啓閘時，則所有石包，勢將全部冲入長江，蕩焉無存，於此兩項問題，權衡輕重，各方對解決方法，殊感困難云。鎮記者公會發起　組蘇記者聯合會　　〔本報鎭江十八日電〕鎭江縣新聞記者公會於十七日舉行第三次理監聯席會議，由蔣嘯塵主席，決定會同蘇州無錫等十二縣記者公會，發起組織江蘇省記者公會聯合會，定於十一月五日在鎭召開第一次發起人會議。社會部籌設　徐州育幼所　　〔本報徐州訊〕社會部將於明年春，在本市雲龍山麓，建設大規模之徐州育幼所一處，開辦費訂十三億元，明年一月興工修建，問徐州雖童政容所，屆時將由育幼所接收合併。海寧塘突起裂痕　圯坍險象極嚴重　縣人請願迅予緊急搶救　　〔本報海寗訊〕錢塘江北岸寧杭段爵字號海塘，位於海寗縣城廂南門外，前十五日突然發現木椿與石塊裂痕，距離達一味　左右，危險程度據塘工局立即派員前來騐察結果，認爲較錢江北岸最危險地區之八堡段更爲嚴重，有圯坍危險者，的在一百五十公尺以上，致引起城廂居民惶惶不安，而連日潮汛又大，城廂各界特召開緊急代表大會，各代表　認爲若一旦坍圯，非傳全城盡成澤國，江洋一片，即對鄰縣及今後之海塘工程，均有極大影響常即集體羣赴塘工局請願，要求迅以槍修。記者頃往訪塘工局，承吿此事不容稍緩，塘工局頃已電水利局請示辦法，在水利局未復雹前，決動員沿塘塘工，立即迅速搶救，以免後患。京滬鐵路豈可落人後　粵漢鐵路力求現代化　平漢路重建黃河大鐵橋　　〔本市訊〕收國鐵路交通事業在抗戰期間損失基重，勝利以後交部積極恢復，茲據大公社記者向交通負責當局探悉，現除華北及東九省所有鐵路綫因受軍事影響，情形較爲特殊外，其他各綫經一年來整理與與修，均有長足之進展，其中尤以西南各省之鐵路綫爲最。茲將國內各重要鐵路綫之計劃增闢及與修工程摘錄於后：　　京滬　　鐵路，滬杭鐵路，在抗戰期間其受換程度尙不致如其他各綫之慘，惟戰前該路行車秩序及所有設備等，均爲國內各鐵路綫之冠，勝利後雖積極改進一，距離理想尙遠，現交部已限令該路管理局，於明年度恢復民國二十六年前之良好交通秩序及設備。　　成渝　　該路測量工程及一應準備工作，早已完成，惟因經費關係，迄未動工，現川省建設　當局向俞部長請領第一期政府輔助費八十億，已獲圓滿結果，政府並允撥給中央三十四年應歸還川省糧款六百八十萬石之一部價款，故該路已定期開工。　　粵漢　　該路爲貫通我國南北之唯一大動脈，勝利後搶修通車，該路現計劃改建現代化工程，美商決定投資六千一百萬美金，美方之新型機車，短期內可望運到，目前行駛之輕便快車頭亦進備改裝，以期增加行車效率及速度。　　廣三　　係粵漢鐵路支綫之一，前因戰事影響不克全綫通車，現由路局　修竣工，由廣州直達三水，全綫通車。　　平漢　　該路黃河鐵橋向爲我國最大工程之一，抗戰初起，經我軍自動炸燬，現經中美工程師數度勘察結果，決定以六百萬美金於三年內完成此一偉大工程，其橋基擬以六十公尺之鐵板埋於水底二十公尺，再以木椿水泥塡入，不日即將動工。　　湘桂　　桂林至柳州一段，前因桂省會戰澈底破壞，故全綫尙有一小部份無法通車，俟交通部撥給之鐵路器械抵達後，即動工與修，期於明年完成　　江南　　交部鑒於該路運輸功能影響首都民食供應至鉅，　於本年度開始重舖路軌，因該綫路而完好，橋樑亦無損壞，故工程常可順利展開。　　除上述各棧外，交部並計劃增闢二新路綫，一爲桂湛綫，由桂林直在薩江市（即廣州灣），沿廣西貴　銜接湘桂鐵路，經鬱林陸川廉　赤坎等地，該路完成後，將稱　湘桂黔四省交通。一

人之政策。此種新宣佈之對日聯繫，或僅艾其森私人之事務。茍事實確屬如此，則政府應通知一點，即美國對以前與美國共同作戰而獲勝之國家，較對吉田內閣與戰敗國其他任何領袖更爲重視。溫莎公夫人失竊　係國際賊黨行爲　一部份珍飾已發現　　〔法國新聞社巴黎十八日電〕溫莎公爵夫人在倫敦寓所失竊珠寶，殆爲國際著名賊黨所爲其計劃似在法國佈置，但法國偵緝　局對此絕對保守緘默。國際偵　機構現正在十七國境內查究各賊黨徒下落。　　〔聯合社電〕溫莎公夫人所藏值百萬美元珠寶之一大部份昨夜失竊，案發後，倫敦警探在各夜總會中抄查竊賊綫索。該項珠寶均經保險。探員報告：一部份珠寶巳在附近高爾夫球場發現，贓物藏於旅行袋中，另有數件珍寶則散落於草地上。竊賊查明係沿水管爬上，由窗口入室。貝爾福宣言日　阿族將總罷工　阿拉伯國王函杜魯門　　〔路透社耶路撒冷十七日電〕十一月二日乃貝爾福宣言廿九週年紀念，巴勒斯坦阿拉伯高級委員會通令全境，於是日發動總罷工，并請各阿拉伯鄰邦響應。　　〔聯合社倫敦十七日電〕阿拉伯國王沙特今日致函美總統杜魯門，責其最近聲明主張聽任大批猶人立即移殖巴勒斯坦，實屬遠反其以前之諾言。該函并謂杜魯門如能阻止猶太復國運動派之殘暴行爲，即足以改善阿拉伯與美國之關係。美國南方多教士（下）　一片辭行送別聲　紛紛候輪返中國  （本報特派員毛樹淸）　　於是我們把話題轉到了徐州，海侔登口口聲聲說：「徐州府」，也許是他多年的口頭語說慣了，他們把地圖打開，我扼要的把中國的大勢述說了一番，我吿訴位們說：「我已經離開了兩年，也許我所知道的也隔膜得很。」還是海侔登太太有風趣，她把話題轉到徐州的物產方面去，許多老太太們問：徐州有沒有桃子？徐州的梨有多大？徐州的母雞是不是跟田納西的一樣肥？大家垂涎三尺了，我們才結束了那次晚會。海侔登全家送我回旅館，在車中，海侔登說：「許多中國人祗知道來美國要物資，這是錯的。」中國人民要驅逐共產黨，不是靠槍砲炸彈，而是靠道德和精神生活。他還說：「美國共產黨不敢擾事，不是靠政府的軍隊，而是靠人民的道德訓練，精神生活，和宗教信仰。」我告訴他，同時因爲工作忙，也沒有時間來研究宗教上的問題。海侔登太太介紹我八月底參加一次「奮興大會」，那是由久居中國·頂頂大名的畢凡宇先生主持的，地點在北加羅里那州的避暑勝地蒙特里脫，阿希維爾大城東邊十八哩。海侔登太太說：「畢先生剛從中國回來不久，會中不僅討論宗教，還要作專題演講，介紹和分析中國的現況，你如果趕去，可以從紐約直接坐火車到黑山火車站下車。」臨到的時候，海侔登全家爲我做一個祝福的禱告，我說他們船上「一路順風！」　　畢凡宇先生的演講，我沒有去聽，離開田納西的前幾天，我倒去南北加羅里那兩州走了一趟。那次去，也是爲找一位傳教士，我的中學英文老師竇維思先生夫婦的。老師夫婦在檀香山，沒有遇著，但他全家的和藹的宗教氣味，卻使我回憶起不少的過去印象。我沒有在南方幾州作傳教士人數的統計，如果統計起來，一定大有可觀。就在南加羅里那州的葛林維爾一城說，就不曉得有多少中國通教士其中有兩位是葛林維爾城中眾望所歸的老傳教士，一位呌赫特遜博士，他在中國十多年，現在因爲老了，退休在家；另一位叫溫博士，新近從中國北方退休歸來，年紀也老了。他們講中國的情形，頭頭是道，至少，比那般莫名其妙的美國記者，在中國喫着嫖賭，亂發電報的傢伙們高明得多。當然，他們都敬佩司徒簡直是狂熱的崇拜。他們覺得中美關係透過司徒大使，一定會步入正軌，因爲他是真正的了解中國，熱愛中國的人。但當我回到紐約和芝加哥的時候，一般美國人對司徒大使這一使命的估價，就遠不如南方。這現象，可以說明美國南方社會和北方社會的不同，也可以說明南方的美國人是虔誠的　往着宗教生活。南方的旅館房間裏，都放置着巨冊聖經，南方的報紙上，有聖經上摘錄下來的嘉言；南方的電影牆壁廣吿上，都引用聖經上的話。南方人祟拜柯立芝總統，因爲柯立芝總絲演講國家大計的時候，喜歡夾雜着一點宗教上的哲理。有人說：林肯總統打敗了南方，不僅是利用北方的工業文明，而且他本身懂得宗教，在宗教哲理上，戰勝了南方的緣故。因此，南方的濃厚宗教社會，培育出了傳教土，傳教士成羣結隊的去中國，逐漸地溝通了中美之間的文化。儘管有人說：他們是「帝國主義」的先鋒，儘管有人侮蔑他們來作「文化侵略」；但無論如何，他們的本心是善良的。一百多年來，他們替中美國交奠立了橋樑，以後無窮年的歲月，他們仍然要爲中美之間的友誼努力。舊金山的朋友寫信來：有四百多名傳教士在那兒候船回中國，去吧！我爲他們祝福！</p>

<p>二次配紗完畢　三次計劃未定　吳市長談紡管方針　注重紗布之發展　配價必顧到廠方利潤　　〔本報訊〕紗廠聯合配銷委員會第二次集團配紗，昨爲最後一次。計民營各廠開售八百九十八件，紡建公司開售六百三十三件，售價照舊不變。紡建所開之紗，其對象爲染織業一至二六五號二十支寳光，又二六七至三一一號二十支陽絲，三一二至四三二號四二支水月，針織業爲一至一一〇號三二支陽鶴，一一一至一七一號三二支富女，又手帕業爲一至四三號四〇支寳光，四四至七三號四〇支雙鳥，會後據第六區機器紡織業公會理事長王啓宇語記者：第三次集團配紗計劃如何，現尚未定奪。一切須俟紡織事業管理委員會於下週間召開會議後，方能決定。　　記者旋訪新任紡管會主委吳市長，當承接見。記者詢以對紡管會之今後計劃及召開會議日期，渠謙稱：對紗布一業，係屬外行，甚恐初辦時，不盡滿意。惟如稍假時日，必全力消滅紗布黑市。關於將來紗布配銷價格之規定，除將考慮其成本及合法利潤外，確將再考慮其可以發展事業之利潤。渠稱：目前我國紡織業雖號稱五百萬錠，惟實際開工者，不及半數。以我國幅員之廣，人口之衆，至少需一千萬錠。故對紗布價格之決定，如不計及發展事業之利潤，則紡織業又何從發展。對於整個紗布問題，望能光從上海配銷公道做起，然後逐步推廣至全國各地。　　據吳市長透露：迄昨日爲止，市府所收到之統計資料，僅毛巾被毯業公會一起，渠表示：最近市府飭令若干公會呈報之統計資料，常有塡報不實之處。對需要量一點，十九皆屬溢報。市府決將切實澈查取締云。紗布銷路呆滯　本外埠市價倒懸　　昨日紗市因各地市價反成倒掛，銷路呆滯甚爲萎靡不振念支四百磅標準紗，去化歲末，致又落二三萬，然重磅貨有　幫吸納，特雙馬屹然未動，尚能衝出二百卅萬大關，細紗先疲後堅，最後做二百卅一萬，十六支去路極滯續降八萬之譜，雙綫與昨相仿，蓋紗市暫已轉入盤旋之局。　　布市連日價向下游，日昨雖略有吸戶，而價仍不起，因本市價格已超過外埠，各幫以無利可圖，均存觀望，烟台天津等幫，且乘貨未起運，乘機脫手，尚可獲利，紛紛吐出，致價格益疲，塲內交易，細布竟無人問津，四君子嗶嘰少有成交，計龍頭喊價八萬六千元，嗶嘰九萬三千元，照目前市况，一時尚難好轉。公債逐步盤高　　公債交易，昨五樓某大戶有進，七樓某戶有售，勢呈掙扎，統丙晨開二〇〇〇元有零，自二〇〇〇元起，逐步盤高，中途升至二三〇〇元，始遭供給，　小至二一五〇元以內掙扎，結果較前收園好二一〇元，甲乙微升二〇元，統丁好七十元，統戊亦漲一二〇元。金鈔堅定　　烚赤昨更爲平穩，起仆狹窄，晨開二二一萬五有售，切時極爲平靜，在二二一萬左右盤旋，十時後央行即以二二〇萬之價，配售一百條，亦乏多大影響，近午曾低至二一九萬五，但午刻仍站二二〇萬光景，午後更爲平穩，隔日交割者復盤升少許，升至二二一萬結束，結果較前收囤小五千，對美鈔之比價在五三九元左右對十兩，飾金紋銀銀元均與前日相同，暗拆初鬆繼緊，暗息仍在一角半至一角八不等。　　外幣甚爲平靜，美鈔門市以三五〇〇元爲買價，並無收進，交易仍難開做，暗盤中已退至四一〇〇元以下，午後平庸少變，結果較前收稍低，港票甚爲平穩，先低後高，結果與前收相彷彿，港匯仍站定於八九〇元左右，印匯一〇六〇元至一〇八〇元，紗花幫有納，英匯一四〇〇〇元至一四二〇〇元，成交不多，美匯牌價未更，對做仍寂。羽紗裏襯向榮　　呢絨市面，因到產及所存有限，兼冬銷緊接相連，致多供不應求，行情向上，西服裏襯，類如黑炭襯，法西襯，灰軟襯，花洋布，袖裏綢，馬棕緞，絲光羽紗，紗背緞，光明緞等，無不相繼吿升，甚至雖漲而乏現貨，蓋一般廠方，均受環境關係，織製數量較前爲寡云。生絲評價下週或將重議　　〔本報訊〕中央府託局中央銀行中絲公司經濟部商品檢騐局四機關代表，於昨日下午三時，假中央銀行開會，決定今後收購生絲之價格如下：（單位千元，以每担計算）　　AA級　五，〇〇〇　　A級　四，五五〇　　B級　四，一七五　　C級　三，九七五　　D級　三，八〇〇　　E級　三，六〇〇　　F級　三，四〇〇　　記者詢問有觀人士，對此規定價格之感想，答爲：春絲可有微盈，秋蘭則將略虧。昨日曾經兩小時之討論，聞下週二，可能再開會議重行商討云。　　金菜回緊　　金針菜近以來源不多，而冬銷不發動之象，行方漸有進胃，昨中　會有開出一批，價已升至十七萬元至十八萬元。工商督導處處長今來滬　　經濟部工商督導處，即將在滬成立，幷已選定江西路一一五號爲辦公地點，兼處長工商司司長歐陽命，定今日來滬，籌備成立，其日期當在下月初。據經濟部上海辦事處息，該處成立意義，在督導工商業循正軌發達，俾臻繁榮，該處所轄區域，除滬市外，京　　市，亦在其中。同康錢莊淸理　昨通知停止交換　　河南路濟陽里同康錢莊，頃以週轉失靈，已被停止交換，是項通知，票據交換所已於昨日淸晨九時前送出，該莊正着手淸理債務，辦理各種善後事宜，該莊停止交換之消息傳出後，外間傳說紛紜，甚有謂金鈔投機失敗而致此者，據該莊某職員談：全係週轉不靈關係，聞此次該莊所缺頭寸爲兩億元以上。船貨未能開斛　米市又吿挺秀　　米市到銷兩不見旺，客貨登記僅六千餘石，粳米形居堅挺之勢，惟下等貨不振，河下勞工尚未解決，致未能開斛，秞米店方繼胃活潑，杜秞羊秞埠秞均見挺秀，客秞高次頗爽，惟中關少裨，白元堅挺，陰元甚俏，黃豆存積尚可，仍難生色，不脫疲境，小麥到源依然淡泊，去化北洋轉懈，南洋亦淡，市勢和平，菉豆交易甚少，依然沉悶，紅糧消化亦淡，續小三五百元，芝蔴仍疲，生仁高貨平站，中下再跌一二千元，蟊豆連跌之後，零化轉勁，略見回升千元，莞豆最爲呆滯，步跌千元，苞米亦小三五百元，麩皮無出入，豆餅平甚，生油略有到貨，人心趨軟，固小千元，豆油菜油彷彿。黃荳外銷尚在初步硏究中　　〔本報訊〕中央信託局對我國東北大豆之外銷問題，已作初步之硏究，但有關人士表示，此事離實現之期尚遠。外銷最大之困難，爲缺乏運輸工具及成本太高，在海外不受歡迎。燒碱續漲四萬　　燒碱昨又起漲風，每桶約上漲四萬元，前傳某洋行有派貨說未能實現，本市用戶及客幫需求頗殷，據業中人云，燒碱國外市價，接連上升，致價格難望下瀉，近値旺銷時期，而存底不多，漲勢當難遏制，司的令澳洲進口貨，前曾聞有小量到埠，現尚無確期，漂粉精客幫搜求甚力，各方扳價不脫，價格當有上勝勢。靑糖續緊　　昨糖市趨勢平穩，靑糖以貨稀續緊，公會調盤現貨中砂白十三萬五千元至五千五百元，生砂赤十一萬四五千元，號貨有汕頭幫開高提靑十二萬元，升千元，冲提靑十一萬八千元，計百數包，廣幫開石門片靑九萬七千元，建幫刁靑十一萬元，升千元，與化幫高興赤十三萬元，中莊十二萬七千元至五千元，共二三百簍。美派專家助日　恢復紡織工業　　〔聯合社紐約十七日電〕紡織機器專家唐納爾生已起程赴日，協助日本復興紡織工業，唐氏將在麥帥總部棉紡經濟科學組服務，担任諮詢工作，預料唐氏之工作將使日本紡織業能適應日本人民及亞洲其他人民之需要。多頭逢高了結　華股升沉不一　　華股昨頗多變幻，中途仍有空方壓迫，不能振作，晨開時之些微穩勢，依然無法持久，十時後形勢漸疲，逢高有隔夜浮多了結，漸漸回小，中途交易忽吿减少，於是人心悲觀，空方得以逞威，一再盤低，美亞退至四千元關，永紗七三三元，景福二六三元，新光二六九元，勤振一八〇元，始吿平定，十一時半後稍稍改觀，銀行幫若中國通商等有買，於是補空漸起，得以盤上，近午奪利復起，軋空較盛，再吿回漲，但未越晨初高價，較前收計各熱股升降微，午後上塲即倘，急進過甚，引起逢高了結者，加之套利者紛有脫售，高後逐漸盤小，引起浮多恐慌，形勢又不甚倘利矣，結果較前收計熱股中美亞新光勤與微降，永紗稍升，景福平平，信和漲起百分之一強，冷股中中紡統益升起半成，榮豐火柴永公麗安五和華豐均稍提升，大通平而中絲全日無成交，新亞水泥內衣微降，景綸漲起半成強，前後市成交總計一一八一萬股，塲外各股除商務南洋微降外，餘者平平。　　外股初堅後疲，成交較多，形勢稍活，結果較前收計英聯怡啤升半成外，怡紗會德豐業廣鋼業航業平平，紙業微挫。中央銀行方針不變　不與普通商業銀行競爭　行務會議重在檢討業務　　中央銀行此次在京舉行之第三屆行務會議，本月十一日開幕，今日可全部審查竣事，二十日閉幕，目前各方對該行會議，極爲重視，據該行負責人談：本行業務，早本銀行之銀行使命努力推進（一）關於存款，本行爲確立中央銀行制度，不與普通商業銀行競爭，故所有存款，均以同業爲大宗。（二）關於放款，凡工商業及出口業有正常需要者，本行莫不貸放，最近舉辦之工商貸款，即其一例，亦即辦理所謂轉抵押重貼現，但爲防止投機或移用，　　不辦普通放款　不動產不抵押</p>
<p>暫不作普通放款，有人希望放款不需押品，或以不動產抵押，目前在法令之限制下，尚無可能（三）關於匯款，爲避免遊資集中上海，掀風作浪，故各地申滙，仍不能不予限制，但仍能顧及正當需要，每月申滙統計，總數極鉅，近爲便利商業銀行調撥起見，滙款滙率，擬照規定减爲七折取費。（四）關於出口業方面，本行極爲重視，爲扶持出口商發展國際貿易，力謀國際收支平衡，曾舉辦三種貸款，第一爲打包放款，出口商將出口物資運抵上海時辦理，第二爲收購貸款，出口商購進出口物資時辦理，第三爲出口押滙，出口商將出口物資運出國外時辦理，</p>

<p>本月配貨尚有餘數三百六十箱，仍可由絲織業於下星期一申請配給，（每週一四均可配購）至原定配予絲商之議，暫時取消，因市價已猛跌，每担僅爲三百二十萬元尚乏人問津，而廠家旣已足敷需要，已無需向市上購進云。</p>

<h3>火油柴油齊漲</h3>
<p>近以加油站汽油每介侖漲起一百五十元，五介侖裝之火油零售價，亦海一千元，柴油門售價格，頗不一致，每噸散裝價自三十二萬至三十六萬元，桶裝須視鐵桶之好歹而定，原裝新裝，每只照散裝加二萬六千元，較次者，則爲二萬元左右，據業中人云：門售商銷戶，多爲小量交易，如數量在二三十噸以上，則車運費用，比較低廉，因之單位價格，亦隨之減低，本市各加油站，零沽火油，價格尚未訂定，故暫時不出售。</p>

<h3>出租汽車並未考慮漲價</h3>
<p>連日傳汽油漲價，出租汽車亦將跟漲等情，關於汽油方面，祗有費用酌增，油價並未增漲，已見昨報，茲據本市出租汽車商業同業公會來涵，稱所傳出租汽車漲價一節，亦屬不確，原函略稱：報載「汽油昨晨突行漲價每介侖一百五十元，聞出租汽車，亦將繼此漲價，該公會已訂日內召開會議」等語，查敝會對於出租汽車調堅價格及召開會議等事，槪未考慮云。</p>

<h3>常勝紀錄繼續保持　羣聲初戰克華勝　五十二比四十一津隊受挫上半時失分太多無法補救</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕群聲籃球隊依舊保持其常勝不敗之紀錄，平津勁旅華勝隊，昨晚經四十分鐘劇戰，仍未能擊破其陳綫，而又五十二比四十一，爲羣聲所擊敗，上半時羣聲又三十六比十三，佔先二十三分之鉅。昨晚觀眾約計四千餘人，情況興壓力熱烈。</p>
<p>羣聲控制大局</p>
<p>大戰全局，始終爲羣聲所控制，初起尚稱接近，各四各五各七後羣聲逐脫頴而出，第一節十五比九，第二節華勝在羣聲猛攻下，全線奔潰，陷於混亂，上半時羣聲竟又三十六比十三佔先，相差逹二十三分。下半時華勝漸見改進，羣聲則不爲已甚，分數逐漸接近，第三節四十二經廿七，總結果爲五十二比四十一分。</p>
<p>攻守兩俱見差</p>
<p>羣聲晚晚仍表演其銳利敏捷之新頴戰法，華勝不能利用其身材高大，時見犯規，上聲在羣聲之閃電進攻下，全綫慌張混亂，其五人聯防，給予羣聲最佳之進攻機會，下半時改用人釘人，局勢漸見改善，是爲守不攻法者，在羣聲嚴守下，時有持球無法進入籃下之苦。其遠射如王鴻斌傳金聲，確有佳妙表演，但無施展其表汪機會。劉學錡之華北第一中鋒，昨晚竟一無表演，大失常態。</p>
<p>羣怕聲勢浩大</p>
<p>華勝又劉學錡·王鴻斌·傳金聲·王有才·王堪若出戰，羣聲則又陳金置·蔡文華·蔡文章·楊人揮臨陳。互贈錦旗後，下令接觸，陳金置連罰得四分，劉學錡王有才百步穿揚，雙雙建功，迫成各四，繼復成各五，各七平手，羣聲文華文章迭有所獲，分數遂扶搖而上。華勝藉口賴鴻斌投入一球，首節結束，十五對九，羣聲佔光。再戰聲裏，華勝又郭金銘入代五有才，羣聲科機而入，文昌左右逢源，隊又廿八比十二遙領，華勝又王有才替出王堪若，但已遠落羣聲之後。上半時結束，冊六對十三，羣聲遙佔先着。</p>
<p>華勝追趕不及</p>
<p>休息之後，重行交兵，華勝又尹煥文代出劉學錡，王鴻斌王有才孝順建一功，羣聲首次四停，華勝仍見活躍，金聲有才遠射迭破盬匯，第三節完了，十　對四十二，津隊追上幾球。末節華聲劉學錡重行入塲，調出尹煥文，接觸未久，傳金聲五次犯規畢業，王鴻兩建奇勛，羣聲又張毓義入替陳金德，金置籃下托下托入，鴻斌有才遠射命中，追至卅七對四十七，羣聲叫停，陳金德替出蔡文華，此時戰情緊張，因之楊人輝·王有才·蔡文章，均又五次犯規被黜，不久法定時間已屆，羣聲又五十二對四十一克服華勝。</p>

<h3>日少女嵯峨浩姬串演日僞通婚陰謀劇</h3>
<p>— 鄔伯翔</p>
<p>沒有櫻花的東北　揭開僞滿皇室秘幕</p>
<p>嵯峨造姬是僞滿皇帝溥儀之弟沌傑的日籍妻子，這次由東北押解到上海，已由中央社在上海各報紙上發表此項消息。筆者身經其事，願將所聞所知寫成此文，使一般讀者對僞滿皇室獲知簡明的榆麻。</p>
<p>民國二十六年的春天，日本種的櫻花在東北土地上萎縮着，開不出所謂日本之象徴的櫻花，一個大的政治性陰謀却在春寒的長春急速地推動了！三月一日頒佈了「滿洲帝國皇室承繼法」，四月三日在東京忽然發表了溥傑的結婚式，這二件事有着不可分離的政治性：第一，該承繼法中第五條曾規定：「皇帝死後，如無子孫，其皇位由其弟及其子孫承繼」，僞帝溥儀是不能生子的，已是盡人皆知的事實，那末溥儀死後，浦傑來承繼僞皇是必然無疑的事，而溥傑結婚對象偏偏是一個日本貴族女子，所以日本的政客把這幕政治性的結婚式儘管誇耀得眩人，說是加强日滿合作，實行日滿通婚，可是東北的同胞均因此盛大的結婚式而困惱了。四十餘年前，「日韓皇室通婚」的老戲，又將在東北重演。要是溥傑的日本妻子生了孩子，當了下一代的僞帝，那末與「日韓合併」一樣，日本可以名符其實的吞併東北。担任這大政治陰謀的女主角，日本政客及關東軍竟選定了嵯峨浩姬。二十四歲的她，在學習院畢業後，正跟岡田三郎學油畫，因爲她是騰原鎌足之後裔，她祖父嵯峨公勝侯爵，曾任過貴議院議長，在各方面說來，是一個理想的女主角，於是，由關東軍司令官本荘繁的撮合，她與溥傑結了婚。</p>
<p>她的命運注定是無福而該受苦的。結婚的翌年，盛傳着她懷孕將產，關東軍當局開始計劃未來的「滿洲帝國」的皇室問題。可是不幸她生下來的却是一個女孩子。過了一年，民國二十八年三月底第二次生產的時候，又是一個女孩子。關東軍對她懷疑而失望了。由獻殷懃的態度而予以冷淡。她還年青，她希望第三次生產個男孩子，以挽回她的命運。一直到日本投降前，她還如此希望着。</p>
<p>嵯峨浩姬　自述結婚真相</p>
<p>政策犧牲下的日本女子，她自己述說她與溥傑的結婚經過如下：</p>
<p>「親戚裏，有一位中山侯爵，到家裏來要我的照片，說是介紹一個相當人物與我作媒，家庭是絕對的舊式封建思想的老家庭，父母之命結婚，是天經地義的習慣，我沒有反對的餘地。</p>
<p>腸胃病院院長橙田的女兒與三格格是相好的朋友，我因爲認識蠻田小姐而認識了溥儀的妹妹三格格，於是我更知道溥傑的一切。父母親說他是良好的青年，即在日本青年中也難找到如此人物，財家之子，往往變成紈绔子弟，希望我對此婚事不要反對，同時學習院（日本貴族之子弟學校）男子部之鹽谷溫先生，也稱譽他是了不起的青年。我還記得，從那時候起，我們開始了交際，第一次見面在我家裏，父親（嵯峨實勝侯爵）非常高興。當時就命令我非嫁給他不可。因爲在日本留學的期間很長，他完全學會了日本的習慣，並且說在滿洲帝國中沒有皇族的法制，他不過像一個平民地生活着，所以我決心與他結婚，將來成爲一個普通滿洲人的妻子。</p>
<p>從那次見面後，溥傑已成爲我家族中的一員，我的三個妹妹和弟弟，對他好像是自己的大哥一樣。當他來的時候，一塊兒閑談，或一同出去散步。</p>
<p>昭和十二年（民國二十六年）四月三日，在東京九段之軍人會館舉行結婚式。我記得起初的媒妁是中山侯爵，可是儀式舉行的時候，却是本荘紫大將，（九一八事變時之關東軍司令官）出面爲介紹人，當時林內閣的閣僚，首相以下各部大臣都出席的。」</p>
<p>婚後生活　迭遭日人干涉</p>
<p>她又說：「結婚後，我的丈夫溥傑進了千葉之步兵學校唸書。在千葉附近的毛見川地方，我們有一所住宅，他是陸軍中尉階級。我們的生活一如一般中流資產者一樣，只雇用了一名女傭，做飯還是我自己動手的。他每日上學，也和普通學生一同搭電車去學校，現在回想起來，覺得那時的生活很幸福。我是舊式的日本貴族家庭出生，他也是舊式的皇族家庭中長大，所以在習慣上並沒有多大的區別，我也沒有覺得十分困難的地方。</p>
<p>到了十月，我們到滿洲來。在長春的軍人會館裏又補行了一次宴會，算是在滿的結婚式。那時，滿洲國的要人都出席觀禮。只是當時的關東軍司令官，（植田謙吉）似乎沒有看到。接着，我們去見溥儀皇帝，同時會見了宮裏的他的家族。</p>
<p>一到東北，就感到不自由，原來在東北的日本人與在日本本土的日本人，好像是二個人種。在態度上，在精神上，二者的不同，使我由驚訝而落膽了。譬如說：吉岡中佐（關東軍派往僞滿宮內之特務人員，其時尚爲中佐。）他連我們家庭裏所有瑣事，多要出來干涉。我又氣又惱，可是有什麼辦法呢？</p>
<p>長春西萬泰大街一一七號，八張蓆子大小的一間屋，是我們的住宅。那是關東軍的軍官住宅，與一般關東軍中佐階級的軍官一樣，我們分配了一幢。屋子實在太狹小了，連我丈夫的書室也不能劃分出來，又沒有私人汽車，只雇用了一個傭人過着清苦生活。</p>
<p>康德五年，（民國二十七年，）二月二十六日，長女慧生出世。做了母親，我忙於看顧小孩子，因爲小孩子是中國人，日本母親的我如何教育她，使我困惑而不易解決，憑着天性的母愛，我愛護我的孩子。十二月，我丈夫調任滿洲國駐日本大使館的武官，連家族全體搬到東京牛込區若松町居住，足足的過了一年自由生活。康德六年，（民國二十八年，）三月十八日，第二個女兒出生，在東京出世。二個月以前，丈夫奉命調任奉天訓練學校的副主任，所以產婦的我，在身體復元後，接着來到中國。</p>
<p>康德九年，（民國三十二年，）我丈夫進了日本陸大唸書。一家又遷到東京，住在麻布區狸穴町。（狸穴町係各國大使館所在地，）翌年，長女慧生巳七歲，進了女子學習院上學。</p>
<p>戰爭巳經到困難的高潮。戰時生活，我們祇靠配給品生活，總算比一般日本民家在質量雙方面都優待得多。</p>
<p>十二月，連陸大也停止了上課。除了長女慧生因爲學校裏功課關係，留在東京下谷區，交託她外祖父母照料外，我們決定離開危險的日本，再來滿洲。那時的交通情形，一切都在危險狀態下，只有冒險坐飛機動身。到東北後，喘出了一口氣。東京有可怕的空襲，在滿洲是安全多了。</p>
<p>實在說，我們是不願意來中國生活的。在日本，假如以平民身份，我們生活得很自由，可是一到滿洲，甚麼地方都得受氣。日本人對待我那中國丈夫，雖然他是皇帝的弟弟，也是一種傲慢態度。到了八月，日本投降了，丈夫離開了我直到今日。」</p>

<h3>「皇親國戚」逃難</h3>
<p>却還是落得個「難逃」</p>
<p>民國三十四年八月十日的夜半，僞滿皇宮裏起了空前的騷動與不安。關東軍來人說，蘇聯軍在國境綫發動戰爭，長春將成爲第一綫，於是嵯峨浩姬携了她七歲的女孩子彗生，隨了溥儀，鴻秋，（僞皇后）等皇族，及「宮內府」職員，共二百餘人，黑暗中錯進了火車向通化開始逃亡。吉岡中將等於這流亡隊伍的押解者，浩浩蕩蕩，大量僞宮裏的實物，行李，人馬在四平街換車後，直奔通化，因爲通化離輯安僅百餘公里火車路，預定的計劃是由輯安越鴨江上流鐵路，逃往朝鮮。他們想像事態不會這末嚴重，於是在大粟子下了車，徴用了大批民房，設立起臨時的「宮內府」。鐵路上職員都是日本人，八十萬關東軍還存在，日本人的警察仍舊是地方上的權威者。到了八月十五日，日皇裕仁的投降詔書，由無綫電的電波傳遞到大粟子，這流亡大隊着了慌，吉岡帶了日本憲兵和僞皇族男子伴着溥儀到長春去作個主意。想不到蘇聯的軍用機正在長春等候着，一綱打盡，全部載往蘇境。或許大粟子是太荒僻得不使紅軍發生興趣，嵯峨浩姬陪着溥儀的妻鴻秋，妾李某等，在日本警察保護下倒也相安無事。</p>
<p>十日，白雪已飄滿了東北各地。這一羣二百餘名落魄的「皇族」，離開大粟子，逃往通化，那時中共軍出現在臨江，如漏綱之魚，又投進了漁綱，財產，行李被清算後，她隨共軍在一起生活，半年間，共軍調換了幾次隊伍。他們逃亡的「皇族」隊伍已近瓦解了，太監，宮女，侍從，均各走各的生路。她携了孩子，隨共軍於四月二十四日來到長春，看看她的故居，打聽她丈夫溥傑的消息。溥儀的「李貴人」一到長春，立刻回到她煎餅店娘家去。嵯峨浩姬與鴻秋等一行，只剩六人了，共軍把她們帶到吉林，當國軍的飛機在吉林上空出現後一日，她又隨了共軍司令部逃往延吉，與鴻秋分了手。五月中旬，由延吉到牡丹江，而佳木斯。在那裏，她遇到不少共軍所執的戰犯，如僞興業銀行的總裁岡田，滿拓的總裁蕭藤，紅十字會的總裁三浦等。七月二日，她由佳木斯到達哈爾濱，似乎是脫離了「皇室」關係，而變成普通日僑了，因爲她已改名爲浜口幹子，而她七歲女兒慧生也改爲浜口朝子。</p>
<h3>女傭露馬腳　嵯峨成擒</h3>
<p>嵯峨浩姬到哈爾濱後，投宿在紅卐廟裏，由日橋自治會裏介紹一個女傭人熊本正君侍候她。當地的日本人想盡方法保護她，因爲在日本人的封建眼光看來，能夠向貴族獻殷懃，是光榮不過的事。八月二十五日，她由紅卐廟搬到哈爾濱道裏的木綿家隱居。</p>
<p>八月中旬，政府與中共協議遺送共軍區內日僑，北自松花江，南自拉法，成萬日橋源源向葫蘆島遺送，改名爲濱口的嵯峨，化裝成一個農婦，穿了破舊的日本軍服，一副黑眼睛，日本農家用的舊草帽一頂，遮到前額。九月五日，混在大批日僑之中，離開哈爾濱，渡過松花江，受國軍檢查後，搭上遣送日僑歸國的火車，通過了長春瀋陽。九月十日到達錦洲，收容在新民區集中營，聽候注射防疫針。</p>
<p>每天遺送萬餘名日僑中，要查捕一個日本女子，確不是容易的事。遣送名簿上，沒有嵯峨浩姬的姓名，即使以過去照片一一對照，誰多不會想到那可憐的中年農婦，就是過去負有大政治陰謀性的女主角。終於在錦州集中營五六萬日僑之下找到了她。原來，她那愚笨的女傭人熊本正君，是不會改名與改裝的，找到女傭人，自然也就找到了她。雖然日本人是千方百計想保護她，九月十六日，她帶了女兒慧生終於來到葫蘆島。</p>
<p>矮身材，三十四歲，腰背有些微傴，一雙大眼睛充滿着憂鬱，時常會神經質的笑起來。能說一口不十分正確的北平話，她說溥儀是怎樣可憐，他又猜想她丈夫縛傑已經死了。一個女孩子在東京，一個女孩子在身畔，日本的政謀家也許不再想利用她了吧？她那未來「皇太后」的迷夢打破了，何况與溥傑結婚，她已是姨太太的身份，（溥傑的前妻，是溥石唐椒，九一八事變後，捲大批財貨，私奔，與溥傑脫離關係。）</p>
<h3>僞滿皇族　硬拖着溥儀不放</h3>
<p>傀儡皇帝的全名，應該是愛新覺羅溥儀。根據滿文的意義，愛新是金，覺羅是姓，溥儀則是名，所以「金姓溥儀」，較妥當的稱呼僞金溥儀。他是光緒之二弟戰　的大兒子，此外，有比他小一歲的溥傑，他可以說弟妹成羣，從二格格（第二個女兒之意）開始，計有六個「皇妹」，二格格是嫁於鄭孝胥之孫鄉隤鼓，破格下嫁，因爲鄭是福建人，絕不是旗人，沾了「皇恩」，鄭在僞滿外交部供職。「三皇妹」三格格的丈夫，是僞皇后秋鴻的弟弟潤麟，有遺傳性的神經病。「四皇妹」的「皇婿」是趙國圻，與潤麟一樣，經過日本士官學校訓練後，担任了保護「皇室」的「禁衛隊」軍官。五格格嫁給旗人萬喜熙，也是與溥儀始終不離一步，負着保護僞帝的重責。當勝利時，溥儀逃亡通化，他們「侍從在側」。</p>
<p>給溥儀遺忘不顧的，是他後母所生的弟妹，今天二十九歲的溥任，及已出嫁的六格格，和待字「醇親王府」的七格格。他們沒有去東北受封，一直在北平過度着寓公生活。</p>
<h3>「僞滿皇后」秋鴻　庚死獄中的前前後後</h3>
<p>「據傳溥儀髮妻，已於八月下旬死於吉林敦化。按：秋鴻係與溥儀同於日本投降前逃往通化者，繼於溥儀被帶至蘇聯，後伊乃被共軍所捕。共軍入長春時，又曾將之帶至長春，復將移至永吉，更經敦化押赴延吉，監禁於此。秋鴻本係病弱之體，再加近侍四散，遂一病而死。」（東北社長春訊）</p>
<p>秋鴻是死了。當讀了上面的通訊後，使人想像起曾經三次被稱「皇后」的溥儀髮妻死得多麼慘。她是前清直隸北道台榮源的女兒，比溥儀小一歲，今年該是四十歲。民國十一年，溥儀十七歲的那年，北平的紫禁城裏，舉行了最後一次熱鬧。溥儀在英國教師荘士敦的教導下，處處地方想西洋化，剪去了滿清象徴的長髮辮，特地取了一個英文名字叫「亨利」，表示仰慕英國的國王亨利八世。於是，他的「皇后」不得不冠一個西洋名稱，叫做「伊利薩伯」。宮廷裏的規矩是一后一妃，與秋鴻同時結婚的壽妃是旗人厄爾德爾。民國十三年十一月溥儀被逐出紫禁城，遷往什剎海那邊他父親的醇親王府去。秋鴻永遠在他身邊。接着，溥儀由日本公使館芳澤公使設法護送到天津日本租界宮島街隱居生活後，秋鴻因病而吸了鴉片，同時發現了遺傳性的神經病，她與溥儀祇不過是名義上的「皇帝與帝后」吧了。民國二十一年十月溥儀由日本船比治山丸送到旅順後，肅親王女兒的川島芳子，首先就說服秋鴻，勸姬就僞滿皇后之榮位。民國二十三年三月一日，溥儀在長春登台爲傀儡皇帝，秋鴻是原配髪妻，也就有資格成爲皇后了。不過，溥儀並不喜歡她，她有異乎常人的神經病，同時，又是烟癮極深的吸毒婦。溥儀所喜歡的是一個名叫「他他拉」的滿人妃子。根據中央社東京八月十九日合眾社電：「溥儀峯擊證人之桌，並高聲怒叫稱：余之妻被日人毒斃，余日知誰人爲之，即吉岡中將是也。」溥儀在東京遠東國際軍事法庭上如此盛怒而發言的原因，就是他心愛的他他拉妃死了，可笑的日本軍閥，覺得溥儀不接受娶日本妻子，於是把他他拉妃毒死，同時又覺得非維持一后一妃制不可，在長春的女學生裏，吉岡中將選定了煎餅店的女兒爲溥儀的「新貴人」。</p>
<p>勝利打破了僞滿皇室的迷夢。二百餘名逃亡的「皇族」到了通化，溥儀及其「皇親」的男子被帶至蘇聯，未來的「皇太后」嵯峨浩姬解來了上海，僞后秋鴻在敦化被囚在鐵籠裏示眾後病死，只有那「新貴人」李某仍舊回到長春，在煎餅店的娘家生活着。</p>

<p>— 寶武</p>
<p>天高氣爽。談談風月豈不也甚好！</p>
<p>胖的，瘦的，村的，俏的——你看，皇后那麼多！人家的興致多高！這不是好萊塢的電影場面，簡直的都是實實在在的人與事。本來，大戰結束之後，人家有的忙於建設，有的忙於振興實業，自然也就是難免有人會忙選舉皇后！</p>
<p>我們忙些什麽呢？</p>
<p>至少，我們爲了要搶買電影票，排隊的時候，也曾多多少少忙過一陣。</p>
<p>漣歟盛哉！大家高呼風月萬歲罷。</p>
<p>不過，話又要說回來。選舉選舉皇后之類，其實也不一定完全沒有道理。譬如說，健美當然可以提倡；而一定要把女性的肉體作爲禁忌的那種觀念在今日也並無繼續存在的理由。</p>
<p>綜前所述，遂談風月如上。</p>

<h3>談小動作</h3>
<p>— 洪爲法</p>
<p>人們的小動作，有時會比瑰異之行還該重視。因爲從這小動作中，可以窺探到人們內心的打算，不致被烟幕的施放或者化裝的表演遮掩了原形。</p>
<p>筆者在賓退錄中讀到王艮等商量死節的故事：</p>
<p>『王艮·胡廣·李貫，皆建文二年第，並授修撰。初艮第一，以貌　，易之以胡靖，靖即廣也。艮爲第二，貫又次之。文皇師入金川門，解續吳溥與艮靖比舍居，咸至溥舍相與誓死。縉靖皆慷慨自明，艮獨哭不語，而溥忽笑。三人去溥子興弼，即康齋先生也，時尙幼，私語薄曰：胡叔能死，大是佳事！薄曰：不然。王叔死耳！語未畢，聞靖隔牆呼僕曰：外間兵亂，可謹視猪，勿使逸！溥顧曰：一猪不捨，况捨命乎！須臾聞艮哭飲酖死，而縉靖皆馳謁馬首矣。』</p>
<p>又在嘯亭雜錄中讀洪承疇死節未成的故事：</p>
<p>『文皇之收復洪文襄事，聞范家宰建豐言，洪被擒時，文皇命先文肅公往說。洪謾駡不已，文肅以善言撫之。因與談論今古事。時有梁間積　落洪襟袖間，洪屢拂拭之。文肅遽辭歸，奏文皇曰：承疇不死矣！其敝衣猶愛惜若此，况其身邪？後文囊果降，如公所料云。』</p>
<p>呼僕『可謹視豬，勿使逸，』和梁間積塵落襟袖間，『屢拂拭之，』這都是小動作。可是明眼人就可由此窺探到對方內心的打算。果然，胡廣和洪承疇都沒有能死節。因爲胡廣的『慷慨自明，』和洪承疇的『謾駡不已，』祗是一種烟幕的施放，也可說是一種化裝的表演。然而正在表演的時候，誰又不是好漢吧！</p>
<p>我們都看過演戲的。在表演悲劇時，觀衆必是爲了表演的十分逼眞，才能洒一掬同情之淚。如是動作上有些疎忽，怕非但賺不到人家的眼淚，還會惹得人家的齒冷。就因爲從那疏忽的動作上，已經分明的吿訴人這是假的了。所謂『假戲眞做，』該是連小動作都不可疏忽的。不過話也難說。要得小動作都不疏忽，這內心的打算，就得和行動能合拍。否則，在一些小動作方面，難保沒有身心不能相應之處。這麽，冷眼的旁觀者，就可從而窺探其內心，發現其原形，正不須等到卸妝以後了。</p>
<h3>文藝家生活與作品</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>文藝家與事業家不同，一個是現實世界，一個是想像世界，文藝家作品，纔是他的生活，事業家生活就是他的作品，也有文藝家同時兼有事業家的天才，事業家也有同時具有豐富的想象與創造，如亞歷山大與拿破崙，均是事業家而具有藝術的天才，如文西與哥德，均是文藝家而富有製造工業，襄理政事的能力！</p>
<p>文藝家的生活與作品，視乎各個的天才而異，單就純粹文藝而言，文藝家生活，愈貧寒愈痛苦者，每每其作品上愈豐富愈高超！有人說『天才就是瘋狂』，其實天才是否瘋狂，不能根據他生活爲憑，惟視乎他的作品內容，是否諧和而一致。須知文藝家生活，不見得個個與現實生活相和諧，眞能認識文藝家，須從他作品上認識之，生活每每在矛盾衝突之中，亞里斯多德說過：『偉大的人物，大都是痛苦的』，龍蒲肅說：『天才是有神經病的』，又如服爾泰喜飲咖啡，呂瑟喜飲酒，莫伯桑喜喝麻醉品，中國文人亦大都如中。文藝家多有怪癖，所以他們的生活，每每極不諧和，而與現實矛盾的利害！中國也有格言，詩因窮而後工，如同荷蘭畫聖倫伯朗晚年，窮苦潦倒，但作品愈見精彩！樂聖悲多芬耳聾後，在痛苦掙扎中，能創作第九合奏曲。俄國文豪杜斯妥益夫斯基，歷盡人間憂患，而有『罪與罰』出世。足見『痛苦是神聖的』，對於文藝家的痛苦，可說是天之賦與獨厚的地方，所以他們生活，也許不正常，也許有許多病態。但是他們的生命，完全放在作品中，只有作品纔能認識他們的眞人，認識他們的天才。若就文藝家生活而言，不一定個個是與他們作品諧和而一致的。因爲理想與現實的衝突，所以他們的生活，也就複雜艱苦得多了。</p>
<p>古今來許多的愛國詩人，不能死在故鄉，許多的救世憫人的作家，不能爲當時所諒解，許多的天才傑作，湮沒在亂世流離之中；許多的慷慨悲歌之士，爲無情冷酷的社會所陷害！所謂造物忌才，木秀於林，風必摧之，鶴立雞羣，衆必侮之。文藝家生活在這種社會中，富有智　與熱情的人，必不爲世人所贊同。換句話正如前所說，『痛苦對於文藝作家，正天之賦與獨厚，』一位眞正的文藝家，他赤心上沒有許多傷痕的，這種人也就平庸得很了。</p>
<p>痛苦非但凈化人生，且而創造人生，使他作品愈加豐富而崇高，常人被痛苦磨刦而毀滅，文藝家視爲盛譽的玫瑰花冠，上有許多的棘刺，花是血染成的，惟天才歡　而樂爲接受此特殊的榮寵！</p>
<h3>秋雲的蹤跡</h3>
<p>— 江達臣</p>
<p>世間還有比秋雲更飄忽無定的景象麽？它朗爽透明，輕如羅衣，舒卷自如而幻滅倐忽。人可以坐在窗前，抑或仰臥草地，吟味着白　蒼狗的哲理，吟哦着：「秋雲一去無蹤跡，何處是前期？狎興生疏，酒徒蕭索，不似少年時！」（柳永：少年遊）</p>
<p>秋天眞的是一個遐想的季節，她蕭疎而清秀，明媚而無華，她引逗人沉淪於回憶的網裏，她使人在愧悔交作與會心微笑的迸發裏，揉搓着自己的悲歡冷暖，甘古辛酸。秋不像春那樣當於生機，倒處桃紅柳綠，烏語花香，充滿了未來的希望。也比不上夏那般雄渾，熱力無窮，而絢爛得似一幅織錦的彩畫。秋天是生命力的低沉，是曲調高昂以後的哀鬱；是遠山如黛，高梧蕭疏，雨打芭蕉，蛋吟　際的好時光。假如說冬天是一個日薄崦嵫的垂暮老人，僵手僵脚而近於凝滯的話，那末，秋天便是少婦的風情，壯懷的遼闊，雖熟悉於世路之紛歧而又未能擺脫往昔豪華的追憶；幻夢雖然初醒。而實在有點徬徨失措。</p>
<p>人可以隨便想想那些像「沙寗」書上的理想主義者的朋友，如何在八年的烽火中洶着，鍛着。有的自然還能倔强地，像高山流水一樣地在浸潤着人的心，然而大多數的他們，又不得不像一個夏夜暴風雨前的電閃，不，最好還是說它像飄沒的秋雲，雖光芒四射，或者是條爛如錦，惟終久似泡影的幻滅。</p>
<p>在一個塔影山光的城邊，和他的摯友告別，可囑萬千的瑣碎；在零落的小村，在漆黑的階夜中進行。然而偉大的理想的熱戀者，他只能把生命看待如一苜詩，一首奔放的詩。他要生得像樣，死得痛快。他不願鈍刀割肉，他鄙棄那種卑微而謹愼的鄕愿。終於他的摯友，便在一個秋雲飄沒的季節，似秋雲一樣地嬝嬝無蹤。</p>
<p>人也可以想想，在什麼被飛機炸得像爛豆腐似的山城中，一個飄零的旅人，在患着寂寞的思鄕病，對着秋雲的幻滅，數不淸自己足跡的浪游，記不淸和那些知己，談過些什麼似是而非的眞情話。可曾墮落於功名的追求，可曾自甘於隨俗？這是唯一值得矜持的質地，除此而外，是否便賸下了空虛。</p>
<p>人更可以想想，在一個籠子裏被悶着，對着那個小窗戶，羨慕秋雲的矯捷和生動，而自已則在重陽前後的初　夜，嘗到了非人間應有的苛虐，在兒子的鐵靴，倭刀和木棍，冷水之下，掙扎了垂危的呼吸。</p>
<p>你飄忽無定，變幻倐忽的秋雲啊！你是生命的象　，宇宙的玄秘，你好像在笑我們傻，又或像在憐我們痴。我們心頭怔忡，我們噩夢重重，面對着一片連天的大火，而無法以智　的心胸來澆沒。我說：我們所缺少的：正是如你那樣的舒展自如而無牽無絆。</p>
<p>你飄忽無定，變幻倐忽的秋雲啊！我到那兒去追尋你過去所經行的蹤跡，我知道，在你美麗的羽毛之上停留着無數的回憶。</p>
<p>秋雲，秋雲，你給人以暖和的慰撫，你給人以凉爽的吹拂，你是生命之光，你是宇宙之魂。</p>
<h3>母與子（雕刻）</h3>
<p>— Royer　Bloche</p>
<h3>哀熊貓</h3>
<p>— 藍寗</p>
<p>九個月前，你來到人間，三個月前，跟人類的文明發生了接觸。剛在四天以前，來到這號稱國際都市的上海，你却再也耐不止再上紐約，回到你應該長住的天國去了。</p>
<p>傍晚，看見你的消息，我沒有話說，再也沒有話說——</p>
<p>可是腦中思潮却由不得我作主，兀自起伏翻騰不止：</p>
<p>小姐，你生而何幸，竟是道世界上稀有的種族！當你一下地的時候，種族決定了你的珍貴。多少人爲你騷動，爲你傾倒。爲了捕捉你，三個獵夫被土匪誤認爲圍剿者，開槍射擊送了命。大學裏的敎授與專家們爲你深入不毛嘗盡艱險。新聞記者更是到處追蹤着你的芳跡，報道你的起居。報章上面也天天刋載着你的特寫和玉照。你來的時候，乘坐着飛機，幾乎橫跨了大半個中國，還隨侍着兩位美國軍官。光是旅費便是六十九萬餘元，沿途還帶着你家鄕的美味。</p>
<p>然而，你又生何不幸，在這幾許　愛詔佞你的人類和你之間，畢竟隔着這麽隻木籠，這麽根鐵練子。他們眞的　愛你麼？他們真的如此愛護，唯恐你凍餒飢寒麽？</p>
<p>我從未到過汶川連綿不絕的祟山峻嶺中間，但我想像得到，當你和你母親一起在崖下溪畔徜徉，飢餓的時候剝食着鮮美肥嫩的竹尖，渴燥的時候吸飲着瀑布下的淸泉。平靜，安閒，那是多麼和平的生活。但是，不幸的是世界上還有人類。更不幸的是人類愛你，瘋狂一般的愛你。甚至殺死了你可憐的母親，以便將你帶到這所謂文明的世界裏來</p>
<p>很顯明的，從你離開你的家鄕的一日起，你便悒悒不歡。你吃得少，睡得少。你是在思念着你的家鄉吧？我猜想。——是在惦念着你的母親呢？</p>
<p>更何况一到了道文明世界，竟住宿在屠宰塲的頂層。深夜人靜，燈光幽幽。索然獨處在這寒風侵襲的木籠裏，你聽到的是下面牛羊臨刑前凄厲的哀鳴，你看到的是斑斑鮮紅的血跡……人，尙且有情，你是四腿的同類，又豈能遣此！</p>
<p>雖說牛羊是受着人類的宰割，你是受着人類的供奉，你們的命運，畢竟是相同的啊！</p>
<p>現在，你終於去了，那也好——一枝折斷了的花枝反正遲早要枯萎的。——願你　到你母親那裏，願你安息，願上帝保佑你路上平安。</p>
<h3>風雨行</h3>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　67</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>小所長窘住了。我瞧着這所長不算壞人，便呌他說明究竟怎麽一回事。他哦延了半晌，才嘆了一口氣，「呌您二位知道，我們這也是混一口飯吃，誰願意幹下去，眞不算人咧……您知車上有的是聽人使喚的探子，他們一天沒有報吿，一天少得二元五。這是實情實話。……三位弟兄，本是押車，您明見，一定看得淸楚。那吃探子飯的，後背皆有勢力，呌他們動，他們不能待着，只好動動。……」</p>
<p>「這下車來，又是怎麽一回事？」我問他。</p>
<p>「那探子第一想遮蓋車上的面子，第二還想打聽你究竟是那一路人，也許還想搜査您二位的行李，要不，他可沒的報吿的材料了。」</p>
<p>「那麽，他爲什麽不照辦呢？」</p>
<p>「這個，」小所長瞧了瞧虎弟，「他看見了這位小……小……小……」他「小」不下去了，稱「小弟弟」他不敢，「小少爺？」又不相稱，「小老爺？」也說不出口，「小祖宗，」倒是願意，又怕不肯接受，他期期艾艾了一下，忽然臉上一開期，「這位「小爺們』，『是！』」他好容易得了這們一個稱呼，不禁自己　美了一個「是！」才接着说，「看他手段高，活兒猛，定有來路。別瞧他吃這口探子飯，憑什麽？還不是靠的幾個江湖訣，一雙明事的眼睛。……」說着又嚥了一口唾沫</p>
<p>「說下去罷！」虎弟大槪又餓了，肝火很大。</p>
<p>「是是…」所長似乎要鞠躬了，「他自已一明白，所以把　子往三位押車身上一撩，各人自己溜了腿。」</p>
<p>「他大槪車上還有伴哪，不能祗他一人。那麽，他爲什麼不多招呼幾個來？」</p>
<p>「那不能……頭一，誰起的事，就是誰的飯，誰得二元五。再則，他旣然看出不好惹，別的伙伴，也有眼睛咧，誰肯自已拿腦瓜往釘子上碰？」</p>
<p>我看他話完了，也不想再追下去問了，便問他要汽車。他又放出那牙痛型的笑容，說只要肯等，他可以趕到雙橋鎭上去打電話，上城裏去呌車，也許待一個多鐘頭。說着又收起笑容，現出那副寒像。</p>
<p>「咱們上雙橋去溜溜？」我們離了那派出所，虎弟拎着包裏，走着間我。</p>
<p>我知道他在想吃點什麼了，便想了想說，「要是順順道，不妨溜溜，不然的話，咱們就順着公路走，碰見甚麽買什麽吃，好不好？」</p>
<p>虎弟冲着東方舉起手來，打了個眼　，「行。那前邊就有岔通，也有幾所屋子，想必有吃食賣。」</p>
<p>走了里多地，到了岔道口，果然有一間吃食店，只那些　　蒸食，看樣子很　，一片黑的都是蠅子。虎弟搶上前去問　裏邊有否座頭。那　　的夥計，搖了搖頭，又　注意的打量着我們。正在這時候，裏間屋子，帘子一開，出來了一位中年婦人，細皮白　，却又是鄕村打扮，外帶文靜得很。她對我們瞧了瞧，便走近我們跟前：</p>

<h3>男女</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>有一個罰誓不結婚的朋友，最近却請我吃喜酒了，有人在揣測新娘的魔力，有人說那是他到了年紀，我並不是個迷信的宿命論者，但我頗相信自然，男女之間，往往是不能跳出他們周圍環境那個圈圈的。</p>
<p>記得有這麼兩句名言：</p>
<p>「一個沒有女人的男人，如在黑暗中行走。」</p>
<p>「女人沒有男人，便憔悴了。」</p>
<p>誰願意一生在黑暗中走路呢？誰又願意憔悴一生呢？這裡有一個笑話，某男說我抱獨身主義；某女說我一生不嫁人；旁邊有人插嘴了，他說：你們二人志同道合，大可偕老。男女皆表贊成，就請這位第三者作證婚人了。</p>
<p>我前面所說的自然兩字，如果意象化，將它稱做月下老人亦無不可。不信，你可以隨便舉一對新婚夫婦爲例子，研究一下他或她的各種環境關係，不難尋出綫索。至於所謂天外飛來喜訊，幾乎是絕無僅見的事。</p>
<p>人，雖然號稱萬物之靈，其實渾渾噩噩，天地畢竟有限，終是可悲的。若干獨身朋友，似乎在反抗，不管成敗，其命運正復相同也。</p>
<h3>巴黎禁娼　聯合國婦委會　與娼妓制宣戰</h3>
<p>— 柴扉</p>
<p>巴黎要禁娼了。法國娼妓聯誼會的秘書長茄司東，柏習烏耸一肩說道：「新的禁令像美國一樣，用意很好，但沒有實效，娼妓像酒一樣，決非一紙命令所能禁絕的。女孩子流爲娼妓，出於自願，在巴黎她們做一夜生意，收入比女店員女僕做一個月還多。」他的唯一責任是從娼妓身上抽取捐稅繳呈政府，據他說一個娼妓收入十個法郎其中有七個是屬於政府的，那一項買賣，政府能課這樣重的稅？</p>
<p>他的死對頭利查夫人則宣稱娼妓經營的優厚利潤金爲妓院老板所榨取。她推翻柏習鳥賣淫出於自願的說法，「事實的真相是如此」，她說：「妓院老板僱用許多引誘女子爲娼的壞蛋，他們以巨賄買通醫生及科學家宣傳娼妓茍能統制，無害於一般社交生活。」她認識一個住在鄉間別墅裏的妓院老板，他從不到作爲他的搖錢樹的妓院去。其他許多手執妓院股票人士，也從不進窑門一步，但是星期日他們必照例上教堂去做禮拜。她說：「禁娼雖已由法律制定，但是妓院老板仍會大顯神通，繼續他們的神秘買賣。」</p>
<p>巴黎妓院內景　巴黎妓院普通分爲三等。在聖馬丁河畔者屬於第三等，一進門，如入五里霧中，等到你習慣這層煙霧以後，你便可見到幾個女子坐着吸烟，男子還飲着酒，顧客多半是黑人與阿拉伯人。鴇母接待客人十分和氣，她引你瞧酒巴間，大菜間以及檢驗室。據說妓女在室內每週檢驗一次，她說：「這裏真好比一個女子學院，我們的女孩子是禁止吃酒的，她們的生活極有規律。」這種妓院度夜資每晚美金六毛錢。</p>
<p>中等妓院的顧客多半是公務員及跑單幫的商人。設備相當美　顧客要是願意，可以通過一扇玻璃門檢查妓女的身體，檢查時顧客可以看到妓女，但妓女看不見顧客。房租每晚美金五毛，度夜金二元五角。</p>
<p>高等妓院的華貴，在世界上堪稱首屈一指。對於一個與妓院沒有實際利害關係的參觀者，鴇母的架子十分大，許多房間對你都關上門。酒吧間十分華麗，有地毯，有鋼琴，有足以容納一個管絃樂隊的音樂台。此外還有電梯，有電話接綫間。</p>
<p>二樓每個房間裝飾着各種不同迷人心竅的圖片，使一套井井有條的罪惡，暴露得一覽無遺。有個房間裝置得有如一座精美的轎車，壁上開窗，窗旁懸風景畫，房間轆轆作響，令人驟生置身行旅之念。有的房間有像愛斯基姆人以冰雪築的圓屋頂，有的像獵戶的棚帳，有的像海濱的廳堂</p>
<p>這兒房租每晚兩元美金，夜度資一百元美金。</p>
<p>可憐薄命紅顏　但是妓女不管她怎樣妖艷迷人，她的收入總少得可憐，他們簡直是妓院老板的奴隸而已，而妓院也不過是個人肉市場！</p>
<p>幸而聯合國有婦女委員會的組織，她在羅斯福夫人等領導下，已準備與娼妓制宣戰，她的許多任務當中的一個，就是協助婦女不再以娼妓營生，凡已操娼妓生涯者，應利用教育制度使擺脫不潔的羈絆，從事正當的職業。</p>
<p>巴黎現在雖已明令禁娼，但其危險則在日後私娼的流行，娼妓聯誼會一類組織也會借屍還魂。在這種情形下，有人問柏習鳥，他怎樣行使他的職權，他只好笑而不答了。</p>
<h3>姜太公不在此</h3>
<p>— W·W</p>
<p>槍斃刦收大員姜公美，真是貪污界一個浩刦！原判只是徒刑而已，只爲姜公不美，輿論制裁，皆曰可殺，終落得如此下場，年紀輕輕，甘冒大不逆，雖姜公在此，亦不能百無禁忌，一向效尤的或躍躍欲試的傻子們，其可再乎？殺一儆百，我們歌頌當局的果斷；進一步希望殺百而儆千萬，又何傷大雅？</p>
<h3>我是「馬克」</h3>
<p>— 志宏</p>
<p>我在都市最大的彈子房裏做了一年多的「馬克」了。</p>
<p>我相信，很少人關心或者知道我們的生活。因爲我們是上等先生們的Boy啊！我們每天要給那些豪客們做十四小時的工作，從早晨九時起到晚上十一時止。</p>
<p>客滿，客滿，別人休假的時候，最快樂的時候，我們却是最忙最不快樂的時候。整天，我們拿着一枝端上有銅架的棒——「來司」，是客人手不夠長時用的。全神貫注，熬着疲倦。客人正在打紅的？白的？紅的落袋了，白的落袋了。於是我們加着分數，三分，五分，七分，……客人先生在打三十元或者五十元的東道呢！不能加錯一分，不然是要吃耳光的。偶然一隻彈子落了袋沒有看見，客人有大喝一聲：「馬克！拾彈子！」把你嚇得魂飛魄散。</p>
<p>別人有班次的，我們却沒有。客滿的時候，大家挨餓，運氣好的，客不打下去了，你於是急忙去打開家裏送來的飯盒，已經冰冷了。</p>
<p>如果在你吃飯的時候彈盤開了，也只好把吃飯的工夫收起來，半飽半餓的去加分數。</p>
<p>每月的薪金是六千元，匯小帳有十萬。我們從來沒有嫌少過。因爲大家都是孩子。雖然每逢把它拿到家裏時，大人們總是說：「嘖，天天看不見太陽，一個月衹有六千元。」</p>
<p>是的，闆老只有給我們六千元，我們衹是拿了我們的力氣和精神變出來的小帳。還要當心飛來的橫禍。一個孩子摔了一顆彈子，賠了幾塊錢還要挨罵。一次還有一個同事在　　布的時候碰碎了一塊玻璃，賠了一個月小帳，他哭得眼睛又紅又腫，真可憐</p>
<h3>新唐詩</h3>

<p>兩路材料處案，糧貸案，迄未「破案」，而小如「碼頭竊風」，大如「監守自盜」，更愈演愈盛，可謂無日無之，調寄「春曉」，然亦「無病呻吟」耳。</p>
<h3>軍中佳話</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>陸軍軍官學校十八週年紀念，校長親臨主持，衛兵由學生担任。入晚，校長手諭：「九時以後，任何官兵不准入校，且要關到禁閉室去」，偏巧，教育長十一時返校，衛兵攔住汽車，不准進去，原因是奉校長命令；教育長無法入門。後來，還是到別處打了個電話報告請求校長，然後校長電諭衛兵司令，才予放行。這種認真守法，真值得大書特書。</p>
<p>據自東北歸來的國軍同志說：在東北前綫。有時候國共兩軍相距甚近，休戰時間，國軍士兵曾向共軍士兵招手並操着四川官話說：「過來吧！」共軍士兵低聲地答曰：「後面槍桿對着我們屁股啊！」</p>
<p>東北本溪河一役，林彪（黃埔一期）曾函告五十三軍趙公武軍長（黃埔三期），略謂：「公武老弟，本溪河一役若貴軍攻不下，則大哥及汝等小老弟在東北將無立足之地；反之，若於三日內攻下，余將率東北全部共軍投誠」。趙軍長將此函轉呈杜長官，杜即命新六軍採取行動，結果，兩天不到，本溪河已爲國軍攻克。杜長官因乃電詢林彪，諾言可否實行。林回電稱：「和你開玩笑的，何必如此認真！」想不到林彪牛吹破了！</p>

<p>「文化交流」</p>
<p>在教部考慮提高大學英文程度的時候，據說香港教育亦將決定改制，辦法是將一切英文學校，改爲小學，與初中同採中英文並重的教法；高中一年後，中英文分系，假使在高中中文系畢業後，可轉考國內各大學，英文系畢業的沒有提起，大約多半是要送往倫敦「深造」。這一個辦法是港府與教部「取得聯絡」後定出來的，目的當然是在「增加中英文化之密切聯繫」。其實呢？我們這一代的英文程度已經可以算得夠高的了，你不看見堂堂×××長的兒女們，都喊做「凱塞琳」「露意絲」嗎？現在教育當局要計劃再度提高，大概今後我們下一代都無暇認識「千字文」，「百家姓」上那許多數不清的中國字了。港政府雖自知爲蕞爾之區，但它對「增加文化聯繫」工作，不敢後人，深恐中國人英文程度太好，反把自己國文忘掉，所以特別加重中文教學，將來再派到國內來「留學」英文，這樣表示國際友誼，實漪歟盛哉。</p>
<p>羣眾心理</p>
<p>中國人讀「水滸傳」的，讀後的心理反應大概可能歸納成兩種：一種是在澄平時代，讀者的社會環境是國安民泰，家給戶足，各人經濟生活不感受嚴重威脅的時候，縱然當時出現幾個如蔡京高俅之流，跋扈營私，弄權竊柄，在政府裏胡攪，但大家總多少能夠默默地原諒他們，而認爲梁山泊那一夥子打家劫寨，殺人越貨的行動是多餘的，甚至是令人討厭的。另外一種則是在亂離時代，讀者的社會環境是政治失軌，貪　橫行，尤其在生活上覺得「奈何取之盡錙銖，用之如泥砂」的時候，他們就感到那些「黑旋風」「豹子頭」型的人物的親切可愛了；在某一些貪官墨吏無法無天向他們張牙舞爪地伸手的當兒，他們恨不得撲上去像李逵那樣「咬下你的　來」，但是呢？事實上的不可能結果　增加了他們對忠義堂的憧憬。「沙漠情歌」開映時，但尼斯摩根領導着數百壯士乘騎下山，刼殺勃哥，俘　達布洽的一幕，觀眾們都爲這般馬賊完成了除暴安良的任務興奮得呌起來，這不是一面明晃晃的最現實的施政　鏡嗎？</p>
<p>古今皆然</p>
<p>最近重讀三國志演義，發覺到諸葛亮很有許多小噱頭，和二三千後今日的應世技倆，居然不無相似。譬如他在劉備新野敗　之役，憑了一張翻雲覆雨的嘴吧，激惱了孫曹火併，兵不血刃，佔據荊州，結果把周瑜活生生地氣死；他竟還輕車簡從，趕到柴桑口弔孝，俯伏在地，哭得死去活來；那些江東俗貨，本來預備爲主人復仇的蠢才們，也被感動得把寶劍收進了鞘；嘆說：「孔明自是多情，公瑾實忒氣短耳。」誰知道一句話到今日就成爲一般以「高風亮節」自居，拚命要「法古今完人」的大人先生們的「酬世寶鑑」了。平時他們碰到有兩個境遇坎坷的朋友登門告貸，縱然有通家之好，也往往搬足了使人難堪的身分和架子，但是一等到這位朋友窮愁以死之後，便撰輓聯，送花圈，在追悼會上悲呼：「我們從前是　角之交，肝膽相照的朋友！」旁觀的人自然都不免要對他的熱情讚嘆幾聲；於是那些在生前以粗糲供養老娘，甚至以嬌妻而把親娘的死活丟在腦後的孝子賢孫們，也就特請名流撰就「不孝罪孽深重」的「顯此行狀」，在心安理得地等着爺娘跨鶴西歸了。歷史家曾經替諸葛亮的諸詐　謀大畫特畫，自然現在的社會就不能不容認這種歷史傳統的延續了。阿彌陀佛！</p>

<h3>Harmonious Atmosphere at Shanghai Talks; Preliminary Understanding Reached; CCP Statement Does Not Affect Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Government and Political Consultative Conference representatives yesterday exchanged opinions for the first time with representatives from the CCP, Democratic League, Youth Party, and various prominent figures. The atmosphere was extremely harmonious, and the door to negotiations has already been opened. All parties expressed a willingness to discuss matters. After the broadcast from Yan'an was released, the representatives also reviewed it. They all agreed that both sides were seeking a ceasefire and restoration of peace, with essentially no difference in spirit. Even if there are differences, they are not significant. Furthermore, Yan'an's request to restore the military deployment as of January 13th can, in fact, be seen as a form of "counter-offer." Making a request is fundamentally different from a complete breakdown. According to what this reporter knows, yesterday's meeting yielded results that are quite reassuring to the nation. Among the government's eight proposals, three or four have already achieved preliminary understanding.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, third-party representatives Zhang Junmai, Hu Zhengzhi, Zeng Qi, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Yang Yongjun, Yu Jiaju, and others exchanged opinions with the three government representatives at Wu Tiecheng's residence on Haige Road. At noon, the third-party representatives hosted a banquet for the government and CCP representatives at Fan Garden, with Zhou Enlai, Li Weihan, and Chen Jiakang attending. At 5:00 PM, government representatives, along with representatives from various parties and factions, and prominent figures, all went to Zhou Enlai's residence on Sinan Road to continue the talks. At 7:30 PM, the government representatives hosted a banquet for all the representatives, again at Wu's residence.</p>
<p>During the exchange of opinions yesterday, the CCP reiterated the views broadcast from Yan'an. It was heard that a certain government representative, because the CCP was requesting the restoration of the military situation as of January 13th, said with a smile, "Then will you withdraw from the Northeast region?" However, as one representative present said, after months of separation, once reunited, they felt very close. Thus, the atmosphere at the meeting was filled with laughter and lively interest.</p>
<p>The CCP then presented "suggestions" regarding the method of negotiation (the CCP representative stated that this was merely a "suggestion" and not a "demand"). The CCP stated that there were three methods: (1) "Stop talking," which means first a ceasefire, then negotiations; (2) "Negotiate a ceasefire," which means first conducting preliminary discussions to discuss ceasefire measures, then a ceasefire, and then discussing other issues after the ceasefire; (3) "Negotiate and cease," which means first reaching an agreement and then a ceasefire. At the time, the representatives all felt that "stop talking" was practically impossible. "Negotiate and cease" would take too long. Thus, "negotiate a ceasefire" was the most appropriate. And once this "negotiate a ceasefire" approach is adopted, the first "negotiate" word should be kept relatively simple, with the time required as short as possible, so that the ceasefire can be achieved as soon as possible, and other details can be discussed after the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Lei Zhen Returns to Nanjing Tonight to Report on the Talks</p>
<p>However, regarding the scope of this first "negotiate" part, the opinions of the various parties differed slightly. Therefore, Luo Longji and Huang Yanpei will first study the content of these negotiations.</p>
<p>As for the views expressed by the government during yesterday's meeting, the government said that they came to specially invite the CCP and third-party representatives to Nanjing for negotiations. It is okay to exchange opinions in Shanghai first, but not as formal negotiations.</p>
<p>However, according to this reporter, the first part of "negotiate a ceasefire," the "negotiate" part, may begin in Shanghai immediately.</p>
<p>This morning, the representatives exchanged opinions freely, without any meetings. At noon, the Youth Party will host a banquet for the representatives. At 4:00 PM, the Democratic Socialist Party will hold a reception tea. At 5:00 PM, there will be a meeting at Lu's residence. In the evening, the CCP will host a banquet for the representatives.</p>
<p>Based on general observations, during yesterday's meeting, the representatives did not seem to view the broadcast from Yan'an with extreme tension. This is because the CCP had previously announced that if the National Army attacked Zhangjiakou, the CCP would consider it a complete split. However, yesterday Yan'an still made demands and did not declare a complete breakdown. Also, Lei Zhen may return to Nanjing tonight to report on the talks of the past two days.</p>
<p>According to Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng, he said to the reporter that there are still military conflicts in various places. To have peace, there must be a ceasefire. To have a ceasefire with effective guarantees that it will not repeat past mistakes, there must be negotiations on effective ceasefire measures. Only then can comprehensive and lasting peace be achieved.</p>

Representatives from the Kuomintang and the Communist Party were present together, and the atmosphere was harmonious.

<h3>Intermediate Figures in Nanjing Hope Both Sides Will Stop Setting Conditions</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The political center of gravity has recently shifted from Nanjing to Shanghai. Ambassador Stuart has also left Nanjing today. Therefore, apart from the activities of a few members of the Democratic League and social figures, there has been very little contact here. At 10:00 AM on the 18th, Mo Dehui, Miao Jiaming, and Qian Xinzhi visited Liang Shuming together. Communist Party member Wang Bingnan also arrived shortly after. Wang reported to Liang and others on the CCP's statement issued on the 17th. While they were talking, Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department also arrived. Wang finished his report and then left. Peng visited Liang to explain the Democratic League's protest to the Central News Agency regarding its news reports, which it had previously submitted to the Central Propaganda Department. After Wang left, Liang and the other four immediately studied the Communist Party's statement. Liang and others also put forward their opinions, hoping that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party would no longer set any conditions and that conditions should not be the premise for negotiations. Peng also agreed with this view, but Peng believed that the eight opinions in the government's communiqué were not conditions but procedures in progress. Peng then took his leave first, and the remaining four went to Mei Yuan New Village at 11:00 AM to visit Dong Biwu. Regarding the opinions they had just studied, they hoped that both sides would not set conditions for each other, nor insist on their opinions, and asked Dong to immediately convey this idea to Yan'an and Zhou Enlai in Shanghai. They did not leave until 12:00 PM. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, Liang, Mo, Qian, and Miao went together again to President Sun Ke's private residence to convey this idea and hoped that Sun would convey it to the highest authorities. Sun also expressed his agreement, and they did not leave until 6:00 PM. Subsequently, after Liang returned to his residence, he notified people from the Third Force in Shanghai of this opinion via long-distance telephone. In addition, Sun Ke also sent a certain person as his personal representative, who took the night train to Shanghai at 10:00 PM, to maintain contact with people from the Third Force on behalf of Sun.</p>
<h3>Third Force Staying in Nanjing Proposes Compromise Suggestions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 18th] Liang Shuming told a United Press reporter that the Third Force leaders staying in Nanjing today proposed compromise suggestions to the government and the CCP in an attempt to resolve the difficult situation caused by the CCP's rejection of the government's new suggestions.</p>

<h3>If the Communist Party Hopes for Unification, It Should Accept the Chairman's Suggestions</h3>
<p>New York Times Comments on the Chinese Situation</p>
<p>[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, New York, 18th] The "New York Times" wrote today: "The reconciliation plan proposed by Chairman Chiang after the victory at Zhangjiakou can test whether the Chinese Communist Party is more Communist than Chinese, or more Chinese than Communist. What Chairman Chiang most desires is undoubtedly a unified China, but whether the Communist Party hopes for this is somewhat questionable. Some of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, like the Communists in countries outside the Soviet Union, are working to divide the country. But at the same time, there are many Chinese under Communist rule who possess the qualities of political democrats. If the Communist Party is most concerned with establishing a Communist regime in North China and the Northeast, then they will not pay attention to Chairman Chiang's eight suggestions. If they hope to form a unified China and advance democracy, then they may accept them. The question is whether they are more Communist than Chinese, or more Chinese than Communist."</p>
<h3>Elevation of Diplomatic Missions between China and India</h3>

<h3>CCP Statement on Development</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] According to a dispatch from the Xinhua News Agency in Yan'an on the 17th, A. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the following statement on the current situation today: "Since the end of the Anti-Japanese War, our party has been engaged in arduous efforts to cooperate with Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek to achieve domestic peace and promote democracy. To this end, we have repeatedly made concessions. In August of last year, our party's Chairman Mao Zedong personally went to Chongqing for negotiations for more than 40 days and implemented the withdrawal of troops who contributed to the Anti-Japanese War from Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, southern Hunan, southern Hubei, and western Henan. This first concession resulted in the signing of the Memorandum of Talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Unfortunately, the day after the Memorandum of Talks was released, Chairman Chiang, having obtained US military assistance, issued the so-called 'bandit suppression' order, causing the tragic civil war to continue to spread across the country for as long as three months. Despite Chiang Kai-shek's breach of faith and the US government's injustice, our party continued its peace efforts, and on January 10 of this year, the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the United States jointly signed a ceasefire order, stipulating that all military conflicts and military movements throughout the country would cease after January 13. Chiang Kai-shek was also allowed to send five armies to the Northeast on the premise of a ceasefire. This was our party's second concession. On January 31, the Political Consultative Conference, composed of representatives of all major parties and social figures in China, unanimously passed five resolutions. At this point, our party made a third concession, the most important of which was the concession on the so-called old representatives of the National Assembly. At this time, the Nationalists in the Northeast, Jehol, Hubei, Guangdong, and other places had violated the ceasefire order and continued their military offensives. In Chongqing, the Jiaochangkou Massacre and the Xinhua Daily Massacre, which undermined the PCC resolutions, occurred. However, our party made a fourth concession and signed the extremely humiliating and self-demeaning military reorganization plan with the Kuomintang and the United States on February 25. However, the Kuomintang's military offensives, military movements, and political reactions intensified. The Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang openly demanded the overturning of the ceasefire order, the PCC resolutions, and the military reorganization plan, and US military aid to the Kuomintang was even greater than during the Hurley era. On March 27, the CCP made its fifth concession, allowing the Northeast to maintain its then-current state, which was no longer the state of January 13. However, although this agreement was also formally signed by the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the United States, the Nationalists immediately and completely destroyed it and launched a large-scale offensive in the Northeast, and the United States turned a blind eye to it. In June, the CCP made its sixth concession on various issues in the negotiations, but Chiang Kai-shek suddenly went through a US tourism agency and put forward five unreasonable demands, rendering all discussions completely ineffective. Since then, the Chiang army, with the continued massive assistance of the United States, has arbitrarily launched offensives throughout the country. In order to express its seventh concession, our party allowed participation in the informal five-person talks on reorganizing the government under the condition of guaranteeing a ceasefire. This minimum condition was also rejected by both the Chiang and US sides. In late September, the Chiang army began attacking Zhangjiakou. Our party, having reached the limit of its endurance, formally notified that if this offensive was not stopped, it would be a sign that the Chiang side was determined to break down completely. The joint reply from the Chiang and US sides was a final ultimatum with a ten-day deadline to accept Chiang Kai-shek's harsh demands. Our party made its eighth concession, only requesting that the Chiang side cancel the offensive against Zhangjiakou, and our party could participate in the three-person military talks and the five-person political talks. This proposal was ultimately rejected by both the Chiang and US sides, and the Chiang army occupied Zhangjiakou on the 11th of this month. All the above facts prove that what the Chiang and US sides are pursuing is only the surrender and elimination of the Chinese democratic movement, and that their military actions are固[certainly] for this purpose. All their so-called political solutions and peaceful mediation are also for this purpose, but to cover up and adjust military actions. As long as they do not abandon this goal, then every concession that our party makes with utmost sincerity and righteousness will not only fail to satisfy their desires but also make them think that this is a weakness that can be exploited in the Chinese people, which will instead encourage them to take every inch and force our party to leave the interests of the people and to completely eliminate our party and the Chinese democratic movement. Therefore, the Chiang side is now launching offensives everywhere throughout the country, conscripting soldiers and collecting grain, destroying national rights, civil rights, and people's livelihoods, and unilaterally issuing orders for the so-called National Assembly. The US side also firmly refuses to withdraw its troops and stop providing aid, indicating that they have no intention of peace and democracy. Under this dangerous situation, the people throughout the country hope that our party will uphold justice and turn the tide. Our party also vows to live up to the expectations of the people, to exhaust our wisdom and loyalty, and to fight to the end. Recently, some third-party figures have been making final efforts to save peace. Chiang Kai-shek, in order to deceive the people once again and achieve his own ambitions, deliberately puts on a peaceful posture and announced his eight conditions for peace on the 16th of this month. Our party believes that as long as Chiang Kai-shek is willing to implement a formal and effective peace under the pressure of the people, then our party can also forgive the past and renegotiate. However, in the past fourteen months, any solemn orders, promises, and guarantees could be arbitrarily torn up. Today's agreement will become waste paper tomorrow; today there are five or eight demands, and tomorrow there can be fifty or eighty demands. Our party, in order not to bear to make our suffering people accept this shameful deception again, has no other demands but only asks to restore faith first. What is the sacred standard of faith today? This is the ceasefire order personally signed by Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong, and Marshall on January 10, and the PCC resolution unanimously passed by Chiang Kai-shek and all representatives on January 31. In order to express our final and greatest concession, our party solemnly declares that if all talks today are to have real results, the sacred validity of the ceasefire and PCC agreements must be recognized; that is, the restoration of the military positions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on January 13 must be recognized as the准[criterion] for all military negotiations; and the implementation of all PCC resolutions must be recognized as the准[criterion] for all political negotiations. Our party believes that Chiang Kai-shek and Marshall should value their own faith and personality, and there is no reason to overturn the sacred agreements they signed. As long as they have this minimum sincerity, our party will certainly continue to cooperate with them to the best of our ability in order to seek the real realization of peace and the real start of democracy. Our party believes that justice will ultimately prevail over everything. The Chinese people's struggle for peace and democracy will, no matter what difficulties and setbacks it goes through, eventually be able to restore the full validity of the ceasefire order and the PCC resolution. We are willing to encourage each other with all patriots and people of insight throughout the country."</p>

<p>Messenger of Peace Comes from Heaven A Record of Ambassador Stuart's Visit to Hangzhou Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng "Stuart" is a name that Chinese people have been familiar with for nearly fifty years, and the people of Hangzhou, China, are especially fond of this name. Because Stuart's parents came to Hangzhou, China, as missionaries, and Stuart was born in Hangzhou. Near the Jesus Church on Tianhanzhou Bridge now, there are still some elderly people who can clearly recall the kindness of the elder Stuart couple and how much the younger Stuart loved sports. And this younger Stuart has become a scholar, an educator, the American ambassador, and a messenger of peace for mankind.</p>
<p>Someone familiar with the Stuart family told me: "They moved from England to the United States and became American citizens, and then came to China. Mr. Stuart has the demeanor of a British gentleman, the vitality of an American, and the gentleness of a Chinese. But he does not have the false fatigue of the British, the impetuousness of the Americans, or the pedantry of the Chinese." Indeed, Mr. Stuart not only has the strengths of the Chinese, but he also deeply studies Chinese philosophy and loves China. In some ways, he has been influenced by thousands of years of Chinese culture. For example, when his mother passed away in Beiping, he insisted on accompanying the coffin to Hangzhou to be buried with his deceased father, and he would be sure to come and pay his respects every year.</p>
<p>Honorary Citizen of Hangzhou Mr. Stuart, when he was the president of Yenching University, students organized the Zhejiang Alumni Association. He would always attend their meetings and express many opinions. He called himself a "Hangzhou native," speaking a very good Hangzhou dialect. When he met Chinese people, he liked to talk in Chinese, and sometimes when he talked to Americans, he would also insert a few Chinese words. He can... read profound classical Chinese and write very good Chinese articles. If the American authorities could agree, we would warmly welcome Mr. Stuart to become a Chinese citizen, and a citizen of Hangzhou, China, because he especially understands Hangzhou deeply. He can memorize every street and every bridge. His childhood was almost entirely in Hangzhou. Now, although he has become the American ambassador, we should also invite him to be an honorary citizen of Hangzhou.</p>
<p>This Mr. Stuart, who himself admits to being a Hangzhou native, has been away from Hangzhou for more than a dozen years. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he always wanted to return to Hangzhou once. His second hometown, Hangzhou, is also eagerly awaiting his return. Every Hangzhou person also wants to see if Mr. Stuart has become thinner or fatter in recent years.</p>
<p>On this... October 18th, he really flew from Nanjing to Hangzhou. The officials and people of Hangzhou are preparing a warm welcome for this honorary citizen of Hangzhou. The purpose of his trip is purely to visit his parents' graves and to meet with his relatives and old friends to see if the beautiful lakes and mountains that he has been separated from for more than ten years are still well.</p>
<p>Rewarding the Pain of Longing This was a clear morning, and the morning glow formed a beautiful pattern. Many people were excitedly bathed in the morning light to welcome Ambassador Stuart, who grew up in Hangzhou. On the road from the Paizhipu Bridge Air Force Military Academy, cars followed one another, including the latest models of cars and the oldest types of trucks. The people on both sides of the road all knew that an important person was coming to Hangzhou. At 9:20, six or seven training planes flew back and forth in the sky. Their... were bathed in sunlight and sparkling. Many people waiting to welcome Ambassador Stuart were attracted by the flying planes.</p>
<p>At about 10 o'clock, the Ambassador's plane appeared, moving from far to near, from high to low, and gradually glided onto the runway. The propellers stopped moving, and the door of the plane opened. Ambassador Stuart appeared at the door of the plane. He was wearing a blue-gray suit and had a tall figure. Although he was a bit thinner, he was in good spirits. He slowly stepped down the stairs. After being introduced by Mr. Wang Kuaisheng, he shook hands with Chairman Shen Honglie, Secretary-General Lei Fazhang, Director Ruan Yicheng, Mayor Zhou Xiangxian, Director of Education Hu Weike, reporters from our newspaper, and others who welcomed him. "Are you tired?" Almost everyone asked this question. "It's okay," "It's nothing!" This was Mr. Stuart's answer. Then, Miss Hu Rongshang, the daughter of Director of Education Hu, presented flowers. At this time, the Air Force Military Academy band played the national anthems of China and the United States, and more than 800 people stood in solemn silence. After the anthem was played, there were three more fanfare sounds, welcoming Mr. Stuart to inspect the honor guard of the Air Force Military Academy and the students of the military academy.</p>
<p>Those rows of heroic and high-spirited youth made Mr. Stuart have countless thoughts. Based on his memory and the current facts, China is finally on the road to progress. Although the speed of "walking" is relatively slow, it has not fallen back!</p>
<p>He nodded in salute to these many young air force officers. He stepped onto the prepared car and drove to the guest room on the left side of the Air Force School Auditorium for some breakfast, and then drove to the city of Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Directly... galloping, the people on both sides now knew that Mr. Stuart had arrived, so they really lined the streets to welcome him, and everyone... waved their hands to express their high respect. Mr. Stuart in the car nodded from time to time to the outside of the window, indicating that his pain of longing for many years had finally been rewarded.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Mr. Stuart went to Jiulisong to sweep the graves. The Hangzhou Municipal Government had already prepared a garden for him, and Mr. Stuart prayed silently with great piety.</p>
<p>Three-Day Schedule in Hangzhou On the morning of the 19th, he will give a lecture at Zhijiang University and linger at Tianhanzhou Bridge, the place where he was born. At that time, I believe that many childhood shadows will be repeatedly shown in Mr. Stuart's mind. He will recall the children who played with him before and every plant and tree in his home. In the afternoon, he will attend the revival ceremony of the YMCA, which is presided over by Wang Kuaisheng, a student who has lived with him for more than 20 years. The 20th is Sunday. He will worship in the Lushantang of his father's memorial hall. In the afternoon, he will visit the famous scenic spots of Hangzhou. At four o'clock, a tea party will be held to welcome people from all walks of life to participate. On the morning of the 21st, he will go to... give a speech at the Qiaokongjun Military Academy, and then fly back to Nanjing by plane.</p>
<p>When Ambassador Stuart returns to his second hometown, we would certainly like to know the results of his recent efforts for peace in China, but he told reporters that he always maintained an optimistic view and was not at all pessimistic. We are really excited that a man of 72 years of age is still working tirelessly for peace in China. This makes us even more ashamed after our own gratitude.</p>
<p>We can tell Mr. Stuart that although the Northeast, North China, and Northern Jiangsu are full of smoke, Zhejiang is peaceful. (Sent from Hangzhou on the evening of the 18th)</p>

<p>Editorial Turmoil and Unrest in the Near East Since the request for joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the Dardanelles Straits was put forward, the sense of unease from Turkey to the Near East has been growing. Although the revision of the status of the Dardanelles Straits is still subject to international consultation, the proposal of this request has made the situation in the Near East tense. Reuters' correspondent in Turkey reported that the Soviet Union had taken large-scale military measures along the Turkish border, and Turkish Interior Minister Sukman, while inspecting the eastern provinces, said: "If we are attacked, all freedom-loving nations in the world will turn to our side, and the aggressive countries that dare to do what is wrong will suffer the same fate as Germany and Italy." It can be seen that the dynamics in the Near East are really worthy of the world's attention.</p>
<p>Another complex international issue in the Near East is Palestine. Since President Truman issued his statement supporting Jewish refugees returning to their homeland, it has aroused strong opposition from the local indigenous Arabs. President Truman's statement, even if its purpose was, as most observers say, to attract the votes of American Jews domestically, has stirred up anti-British and anti-American sentiment among Arabs abroad. According to a Reuters Damascus telegram on the 17th, Syrian Arabs are once again calling on Arab youth to arm themselves to defend the "Holy Land" because of the Palestinian issue, which shows that the emotions of the local people are already very激昂. How to resolve the Palestinian issue is less about the Jewish resettlement movement and more about the movement of the entire Arab nation in the Near East. The oil fields in the Near East are certainly worthy of the world's attention, but the importance of the Near East's strategic position in the world should not be ignored. It is a key area between "East" and "West," and controlling the Near East means controlling a major strategic stronghold in the world. Although the Near East is currently under the control of the so-called "Western countries," if the actions of the "Western countries" do not receive the support of the local people, the trends in the Near East are really worrying.</p>
<p>The Iranian issue is also deeply connected to the Near East issue. The subtle relationship between the "autonomous" movement of the people of Azerbaijan is self-evident. Under the Soviet Caucasian Federal Republic, there was originally the establishment of the Azerbaijani Republic. The "autonomous" movement of the people of Azerbaijan in northern Iran is undoubtedly supported by the Soviet Union. With the birth of this movement, we saw the emergence of a Kurdish ethnic autonomous movement in Iraq. Since the emergence of these "autonomous" movements, Iran and Iraq have had more troubles. Today, the situation in northern Iran remains the same, fortunately, the rebellion that appeared in southern Iran has now ended. According to a United Press International Tehran telegram on the 17th, the Iranian government published an official report stating: "The rebellion in southern Iran by indigenous people against the Iranian government has lasted for months and has now agreed to stop the rebellion. Both sides have agreed to increase the number of parliamentarians from Fars Province and extend the railway line to Fars Province. Amnesty the rebels and select provincial officials from residents of Fars Province." So, at least in southern Iran, the situation seems to have stabilized.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is worth noting British Foreign Secretary Bevin's statement in Congress regarding the situation in Iran. He said: "The British government is very willing to establish good relations with the Iranian government. The British government wants to see Iran prosper, be strong, independent, and not be interfered with by outsiders. Soviet newspapers and Iranian broadcasts have repeatedly made major propaganda about unfounded rumors about British officials. The British government will try to inform the Iranian people of the truth... The British government hereby declares: British diplomats or consular officials in Iran have been ordered not to interfere in Iran's internal affairs, and the British government is very satisfied that British officials in Iran have not violated this instruction." At that time, Labour Party member Leiter stood up and asked Bevin: Can he be sure that other countries have not interfered in Iran's internal affairs? Bevin smiled and did not answer. It can be seen that the relationship regarding the situation in Iran is complex and subtle.</p>
<p>Of course, from a more distant perspective, the turmoil and unrest in the Near East is a microcosm of the turmoil and unrest in the world. However, since the beginning of modern history, the Near East has been a battleground for the great powers. The dream of the Berlin-Baghdad Railway promoted the outbreak of the First World War, and the traditional policy of "pushing eastward" promoted the Second World War. For the sake of lasting world peace, the turmoil and unrest in the Near East cannot be allowed to continue.</p>

<p>Land to the Tiller First Implemented in Pacification Zones Beneficial to Both Farmers and Landlords Xiao Zheng Talks About the Future of Land Reform [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The time for the reform of China's land system has matured. In order to understand the truth of this major reform, the reporter specially visited Xiao Feng, the chairman of the Chinese Land Administration Society, who told us that land reform is the foundation for establishing a new agricultural system in China and a prerequisite for industrialization. The association has appealed for years and has been praised by enlightened people from all walks of life. International scholars also agree that China must reform the feudal landlord system so that farmers can improve their lives, and China's economy can move towards prosperity and progress. After the restoration, the association, in view of various economic and political factors, believes that the time for implementing land reform has come, so it advocates taking immediate measures to implement land to the tiller. The highest leader of our party and the government have also praised this, but because the matter is of great importance and all preparations have not been perfected, it is only approved to be implemented first in the pacification zone. I was ordered to participate in drafting, and after multiple reviews, it has now been reviewed and approved by the National Defense Supreme Committee. In addition to setting out the land reform points in the administrative program of the pacification zone, a method for land disposal in the pacification zone has been specifically formulated as a guideline for implementation. When asked why this method was first implemented in the pacification zone, Xiao said that this does have its objective environment and value. Because the pacification zones, such as northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, northern Henan, and Hebei, Shandong, and the northeastern provinces, are the most famous wheat-growing areas in our country. It is best to operate on a large scale. This time, after the war, the population has decreased, especially the number of strong men who have sacrificed is very large, and the labor force is insufficient. Its innate conditions are not suitable for the tenant farming system. Therefore, according to this method, the promotion of land to the tiller is often very smooth. However, after farmers acquire land, they must first be persuaded to cooperate in management. Agricultural authorities and Farmers Bank must immediately prepare for ploughing cattle, agricultural tools, seeds, and fertilizers for the spring ploughing next year. I have suggested to the Farmers Bank authorities that in addition to consulting with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to quickly transport tractors to each area and set up stations to rent them to cooperative farms, they should also order a large number of tractors and their ancillary agricultural implements from the United States for use by cooperative farms in each area. This land reform will transfer the land of landlords to farmers and enable farmers to operate the land they receive in cooperation, becoming modern new-style farms. Then China's new morning industry system can be started here. Because the areas that have been destroyed for a long time and the farmers in each area who have suffered a lot, the government really needs to make them get agricultural relief first and achieve economic prosperity as soon as possible. As for the landlords in each area, because of the implementation of this method, their land rights, which have been illegally distributed and have actually been lost, will be compensated again. The China Farmers Bank will provide land bonds with extremely solid credit. The land price can be recovered from the bank in installments every year, and there is no need to bear the burden of land tax again. Because according to this method, the land tax collected this time is transferred to the farmers who receive the land, so that landlords can invest in industries by recovering the land price in the future, becoming enterprises under the modern economic system, which is also beneficial to landlords. After Xiao explained that this method can take into account the interests of both the landlords and the farmers, he expressed his sincere expectations and ideals in a pleasant tone, hoping that the central and local agencies responsible for the promotion can understand the deep meaning of the central government's passage of this method, make proper plans for implementation, and make it effective quickly. Then, the promotion of this method to the country, so that the great cause of land reform can be fully realized, is what the national farmers pray for.</p>
<p>The Situation is Bright Urgent Relief is Planned Total Registration of Refugees in Northern Jiangsu More and More Refugees in Zhenjiang Request to Return Home [Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang News] The Su-Ning Branch recently determined that the situation in Northern Jiangsu is becoming clearer day by day. In order to carry out urgent relief quickly and accurately, it has specially formulated the "Guidelines for Relief and Inspection Work" and revised the "Refugee Registration Form" and "Flour Collection Certificate" styles. A general refugee registration will be held in various recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu on a regular basis. The personnel of the work team stations in various places sent by the headquarters of the China Federation of Trade Unions (CFTU) will form one unit, the Social Affairs Office, the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference, and the local government will form one unit, and the Refugee Association and other groups will form one unit to organize a three-person group (that is, each group will send one person from the above three units) and divide them into several groups according to work needs to carry out the review work. The refugee standards are stipulated as follows: (1) Those who are displaced due to war, have a poor life, and have no job. (2) Those who are refugees with jobs but low income and whose direct relatives are three or more, and must be supplied with living expenses by them. After investigation, it is found that the total number of people in the household minus three, the rest can be given relief. (3) Public educators are not within the scope of relief, but if their income is low and their families are indeed refugees with a poor life, they can be handled in accordance with Item 2.</p>

<p>Bandit Cai's Troops Stirring County Magistrate Sets Out to Suppress [Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th] The bandit Cai Haogong's troops, stationed near Guangfu Town in the third district of Suzhou, number about 200 people. They are equipped with a large number of light and heavy machine guns and rifles. Recently, they suddenly hoisted the false banner of the Democratic League, with the intention of expanding their power. At 7:00 PM on the 13th of this month, Cai personally led dozens of his troops to sneak into Tangcun Township in the Binhu area of the third district, inviting the township chiefs and Baozhang to do their best to incite them. They also set up mobile tax checkpoints at the important transportation hubs of Dachixiang and Yangshan Township on the Su-Xi Highway, levying tolls on passing trucks at 20,000 yuan per vehicle, euphemistically calling it a protection fee. In addition to ordering County Magistrate Lu to lead troops to suppress them nearby, the Clearing and Suppression District has also planned countermeasures.</p>
<p>Jiading Imposes Income Tax County Government Borrows Taxes Without Approval [Our Newspaper, Jiading News] The Jiading Inspection and Tax Collection Office of the Nantong Branch of the Jiangsu District Direct Tax Bureau recently received an order from the higher authorities to impose the first category of business income tax for the 34th year. It is learned that Wang Yongzheng, the director of the office, has discussed it with the county chamber of commerce several times and has dispatched a large number of tax officials from the Nantong branch to Jiading to start the tax collection.</p>
<p>[Another News] The Interim County Council of this county, because of the difficulty in county government funding, which hinders the implementation of county administration, once decided at the second general meeting to pre-borrow 200 million yuan of field taxes from large households and submitted it to the provincial government for review and approval. It is learned that the provincial government believes that the difficulty in county government funding is indeed the case. The date of the field tax collection has been stipulated, and it should be expedited to collect and enrich the financial resources. The pre-borrowing section wastes public property and easily breeds malpractices. It sent an electric instruction not to allow it.</p>
<p>Traitor Zhao Zhaoban Escorted to Wuxing County Government Issues Announcement Soliciting Crimes [Our Newspaper, Wuxing News] Military traitor Zhao Zhaoban, who formerly served as a lieutenant colonel of the National Soldiers Regiment attached to the Changyu, defected to the enemy during the enemy's intrusion in the 32nd year of the Republic of China and served as the district chief of the false Hongqiao district, lieutenant colonel counselor of the false Army Headquarters, and other positions. He also induced the self-defense team to rebel and defect to the enemy. After the victory, the traitor Zhao actually mixed into the 17th Army Officer Training Corps and served as the captain of the squadron. After someone secretly reported it to the Second District Special Commissioner's Office, the special commissioner approved the central government to bring the traitor Zhao Zhaoban to the lake for detention and interrogation. The special commissioner has issued an announcement to the people that if there are victims who have been ravaged by the traitor, they can submit evidence and appeal to be investigated and dealt with.</p>

<p>Suzhou Land Price Storm Interim County Council and Land Registration Office Turn Against Each Other [Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th] Since the land prices in this county were hastily assessed by the Land Registration Office, people throughout the county believe that not only does it exceed the current value, but it is also ten times higher than the contract tax price approved by the provincial government two months ago. The levy of the rice land tax will inevitably greatly increase the burden on the people, and the post-robbery society cannot bear the burden. Therefore, the County Interim Council was previously requested to invite Zhang Zidao, Deputy Director of the Land Registration Office, and Special Commissioner Wu Zhongfan to hold a review meeting on the 15th, but the result was that the two sides broke up unhappily. On the 16th and 17th, the County Interim Council specially convened a meeting with the district office to solicit the opinions of all the township chiefs. All expressed that the valuation was too high and unanimously requested a more fair assessment. Therefore, on the morning of the 18th, it again invited the Land Registration Office to hold the second review meeting. The County Interim Council, based on public opinion, requested the Land Registration Office to re-evaluate the price. Deputy Director Zhang of the Land Registration Office replied: "The government authorizes the land administration agency to handle the valuation of land prices in full authority, which has nothing to do with the Interim County Council." The councilors, upon hearing this, believed that it was a disregard for public opinion and walked away in anger. A huge uproar occurred at the meeting. After much negotiation, it was finally decided that the Land Registration Office would provide evidence for the assessment of this valuation, and the Interim County Council would collect recent sales contracts, referring to each other to re-evaluate the new land price with the most accurate current value. The meeting ended at around 2:00 PM.</p>

<p>The Mayor Denies Postponing Conscription; Shanghai Will Implement Step-by-Step Once Central Government Issues Clear Orders; The Current Problem of Electricity Conservation Cannot Be Delayed</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] This reporter interviewed Mayor Wu at 5:00 PM on the 18th to inquire about various issues such as conscription and electricity shortages in the city. Mayor Wu replied as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the conscription issue, it is a decision made by the central government. Since Shanghai has been designated as a pilot area for implementing military service, it must be carried out. As for the rumors circulating that the city is postponing conscription, there is absolutely no basis for them. Shanghai is an integral part of the country, and it should take the lead in implementing government orders. Mayor Wu believes that implementing military service is a duty that all citizens should fulfill. Democratic countries such as the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have already implemented it. Therefore, after the city's civil affairs department receives instructions from the central government on implementing military service in Shanghai, preparations will be made step by step.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the city's electricity shortage, Mayor Wu said that he felt extremely pained and disgusted by the waste of electricity. Many shops in the city keep their lights on at night, wasting a great deal of electricity. Mayor Wu must control this and use the electricity for factory production. Regarding how to conserve electricity, Mayor Wu offered principles: shops should aim to save 20%, and households 10%, while those using electricity within reasonable limits will not be restricted. Mayor Wu is very eager to realize any plan, and he hopes that the electricity conservation measures can be implemented starting from the first of next month. However, this plan still needs to be studied in detail by the Municipal Public Works Bureau before a final decision is made. Yesterday, Mayor Wu only stated: To increase production, electricity conservation measures must be implemented.</p>
<p>Census</p>
<p>(3) Mayor Wu has decided to personally investigate the city's household registration situation next month, accompanied by the Civil Affairs Department. He will conduct spot checks on household registrations in special districts, with the focus on household registration work and the cleanliness of each district, as Mayor Wu believes that to put the city's public security on track, household registration work must be done well first.</p>
<p>Streamlining Staff</p>
<p>(4) Regarding streamlining staff and implementing layoffs, Mayor Wu believes that it must be based on the decision of the Municipal Council, and the original staffing will be reduced by 15%. However, it is necessary to consider the current number of employees as the standard. If it is found that some staff members have not exceeded the staffing number and are extremely busy with their work, then there will be no possibility of further layoffs. If the number of people in various affiliated agencies exceeds the staffing number, then layoffs must be implemented to save expenses. The Personnel Department is currently investigating this.</p>
<p>Anhui Disaster Relief Association Formally Established</p>

<p>Tuberculosis Prevention Committee Expands Organization</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] In order to utilize the medical equipment that the American Red Cross is about to donate to the Shanghai Tuberculosis Prevention Committee to promote tuberculosis prevention work, it has been decided to invite relevant organizations in the city and the Department of Health to jointly expand the organization into the Shanghai Tuberculosis Prevention United Committee. The association held its inaugural meeting at the YMCA the day before yesterday, publicly electing Mayor Wu as the honorary president of the association, Yan Huiqing as the president, Zhang Wei and Ding Guitang as the vice presidents, Wu Shaoqing as the executive secretary, and Xu Zhendong as the accountant.

<p>Film Actor Suspected of Collaboration; Zhou Qi Still Not Summoned</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Film actor Zhou Qi was previously accused by the city's Dazhong Evening News of having collaborated with the enemy. He filed a complaint with the local court accusing the newspaper of defamation. After the court's trial, the Dazhong Evening News was declared not guilty. On the other hand, the newspaper formally reported Zhou to the High Procuratorate, accusing him of being a traitor. Zhou failed to appear at the first inquiry and investigation. Zhou still did not appear at the second hearing and investigation yesterday morning. Only Hu Hanjun, the editor-in-chief of the Dazhong Evening News, appeared in court to provide evidence. The case was adjourned for further review.</p>
<p>Electricity Consumption in Zhabei Increasing Endlessly; Reasonable Restriction Measures Will Be Established; More Than 1,000 Electricity Meters Stolen</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] As winter approaches, electricity consumption is bound to increase, and the problem of electricity shortage in the city is becoming increasingly serious. This reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company yesterday. According to the conversation: After the victory, the Zhabei urban area has developed the fastest, and the amount of electricity consumption has increased endlessly, especially the increase in the past month is the highest. It is also said that the restriction measure of 90% or 80% of the electricity consumption in the previous month is not very fair, because users who waste electricity, even if they are 90% or 80%, still do not meet the original purpose of saving electricity, while users who have always been extremely economical with electricity will be greatly affected after 90% or 80%. Therefore, the company authorities are now planning to establish a fair and reasonable restriction measure based on the size of the user's electricity meter amperage. It is also learned that the trend of stealing electricity meters in the Zhabei urban area is very rampant. Since the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company took over, more than 1,000 large and small electricity meters have been stolen, resulting in considerable losses, and our country cannot manufacture them ourselves, so it is extremely difficult to replenish them. Therefore, the company authorities are feeling troubled by this.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Various Industries Crowded Together to Convene the National Assembly; Unanimous Approval of the Chairman's Eight Principles</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the industry associations of various industrial and commercial sectors in the city yesterday telegraphed Chairman Chiang to express their unanimous support for the government's promulgation of the National Assembly convocation order and the eight principles for handling the current situation: "To Chairman Chiang, Nanjing National Government: Recently, we read the government's promulgation of the National Assembly convocation order, adhering to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's testament of 'the world belongs to all,' in line with the republican system of government with sovereignty residing in the people. From this point on, more than ten years of arduous nurturing of political tutelage comes to an end. The government strives for the country, embodying the spirit of what the ancients called 'if the world belongs to all, there will be no uprisings.' This can clearly show the consensus and stabilize the inclination of both domestic and foreign political psychology. The factions of dissenting opinions lose their foundation, and the boundless future of China is truly built upon this. The associations hereby represent the city's industry and commerce in firmly supporting. Looking around the country, for the past year, wars have not ceased, and the people's livelihood has been withering. To have good politics, we must first seek lasting peace. Recently, we learned that Your Excellency announced eight principles for handling the current situation on the 16th of this month, using the spirit of moderation as the ultimate plan to end disputes. All descendants of the Yellow Emperor share the same sentiment and reason. We especially hope that benevolent words will be widely spread and bring about harmony. With the sincerity of seeking good governance, we express our unanimous approval and humbly request your consideration. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and all industrial and commercial associations respectfully submit."</p>
<p>Amidst Severe Housing Shortage, A Tragedy in Zhabei</p>
<p>Dai Jinji Copper and Tin Shop, No. 537, Datong Road, Zhabei, near the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, under the jurisdiction of the 14th District, belongs to Dai Fugeng from Taizhou, who borrowed capital of about 5 million yuan at high interest rates from relatives and friends to open a small shop, relying on it to maintain the lives of his family. On the 12th of this month, two former railway police officers from the Shanghai Railway Bureau went to warn him that the location belonged to the Railway Bureau. When Dai Baogen heard this, he thought that the housing shortage in Zhabei was severe, there was nowhere to move, the business would be forced to stop, the debts to relatives and friends could not be repaid, and the family's livelihood was on the verge of collapse, so he suddenly had thoughts of ending his life. He secretly prepared sleeping pills at around 9:00 PM, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately, his family discovered it early and quickly sent him to Tongren Hospital for emergency treatment. It is said that he is out of danger.</p>
<p>Accused of Abusing Adopted Daughter; Court Hears Old Case</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Xu Nigun, the former head of the puppet Economic Bureau, originally lived at No. 9, Daxing Lane, Julaiyuan Road. Before the victory, he relied on his power to try to buy the house at No. 8 next door but failed, thus forming a feud with Ms. Shi Yunfen, the owner of No. 8. In July of last year, after hearing tragic cries from the neighboring wall, he suspected that Shi Yunfen was abusing her 14-year-old adopted daughter, Ge Lian. Xu reported this to the puppet police station at the time, who transferred the case to the puppet procuratorate. Before this case could be concluded, the Japanese army surrendered, and Xu was arrested for treason. Later, the procuratorate investigated and prosecuted Shi after reviewing the case. The Eighth Criminal Court of the local court heard the case yesterday. Shi Yunfen and her adopted daughter, Ge Lian, appeared in court. Shi Yunfen testified that Ge Lian went to the noodle shop at No. 648, Changle Road, to work. She was accidentally scalded by a hot water bottle by the noodle shop owner, and she received daily medical treatment. Ge Lian yelled when the dressing was changed, which was not abuse. Ge Lian also testified that she had not been abused and wanted to return to her adoptive mother's home. The court ordered a retrial on the 25th.</p>

<p>Model Panda Dies in Regret, Unable to Enjoy the Beauty's Favor</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The panda is dead.</p>
<p>She died in the middle of the night the day before yesterday. No one knows the exact time. The first person to discover that "Miss" had died was a worker named Chen Asi at the slaughterhouse. He had prepared bran and bean flour brought from Sichuan yesterday morning, wanting to ask the panda team to give "Miss" some breakfast. But "Miss" had already left this prosperous world and no longer needed to enjoy the earthly pleasures.</p>
<p>Director Wei Jingmeng of the International Propaganda Office and Captain Ke Ninghan, who escorted "Miss" to Shanghai, rushed to the slaughterhouse upon hearing the bad news. Their feelings were like a father mourning his beloved daughter, and the other was like a bridesmaid mourning the bride who died before her wedding. The sense of responsibility was mixed with the affection for a beautiful woman. Was it sadness? Was it sighing? Or was it annoyance?</p>
<p>The remains of "Miss" are temporarily stored in the cold storage room of the slaughterhouse. Going through two heavy iron doors, the reporters paid their last respects to "Miss." She lay quietly in a rectangular lead box, placed in a small room separated by wire mesh. The bloody carcasses of slaughtered pigs and cattle were her neighbors. Her limbs were stiff, her eyelids were not closed, and her eyes were still so black and so clear. Was she still thinking about her distant hometown, looking for the deep mountains and wilderness with lush bamboo? Was she trying to protest: She should not have died in such a cold guest room, she should not have been lying next to the corpses of pigs and cattle under the butcher's knife! The light was dim, and the cold air was piercing. Some of the warmth that we, the kind-hearted reporters, brought in caused the icicles on the ceiling to melt, and water dripped down, as if weeping sadly at the tragic fate of "Miss"!</p>
<p>How did the panda die? Was it because the wounds on her body when she was captured recurred? Was it because of the hardships and fatigue of the journey and the acclimatization? Or was it because the medicine for the wounds and the stench of the slaughterhouse damaged her spleen and stomach? In fact, no matter what, the fate of "Miss" had long been decided. Wasn't the experience of her predecessor "Miss United" enough to explain everything? Readers! It's like a person who loves freedom being imprisoned in a copper wall and iron wall. It's either madness or death, the only difference is sooner or later. "Miss"! Some people envied you for taking a plane and appearing on camera, and some people regretted that you didn't have time to cross the Pacific Ocean and go to the gold and dollar kingdom; but I say, you are blessed! You have escaped the torment, you have been freed from the pain, rest in peace!</p>
<p>The urgent telegram reporting the death has been sent to Mr. Peeval of the New York Zoo. The disposal of the panda's remains should be decided in a day or two.</p>
<p>Social Service Answers Readers' Legal Questions</p>
<p>Yi Jing, Tong Guojun asks: My friend, Mr. Mou, moved to the mainland with his service organization during the Anti-Japanese War. His family property in his hometown was sold by his second brother. His elder brother was kind and honest and did not dare to stop him. After the victory, Mr. Mou returned to his hometown and naturally could not recognize this illegal transaction. There are three questions, please answer.</p>
<p>(1) During the enemy-puppet period, contracts signed without a licensed person were illegal, and this contract has expired. Mr. Mou has also published a statement in the newspaper declaring it null and void, and the contracting party has never contacted Mr. Mou. Is this contract no longer in effect?</p>
<p>(2) The name of the contracting party of this contract was asked of the local enlightened town chief, but he did not recognize the person. The rent collector is the remnant of a famous traitor in the village during the enemy-puppet period. After checking the contract, it is found to be harsh and benefits him greatly. Therefore, before the expiration date, (Mr. Mou's sixth brother) repeatedly negotiated to recover it, but was rejected. Can we, in accordance with the rice price at the time, settle the losses of rent grain over the years based on the unreasonable contract? (Note: If there are any gains from this loss, they will be donated in full to the local primary school education fund).</p>
<p>(3) What procedures should be followed to settle the rent grain over the years?</p>
<p>(Lawyer Qin Liankui Answers) Regarding your friend's case, if the field sold by his second brother belongs to your friend, then the second brother's sale is legally invalid and does not affect your friend's property rights. The rent grain lost as a result can also be claimed for compensation. However, since your second brother is deceased and has no spouse or children, his brothers and sisters should be the heirs according to law. The other party also has the possibility of claiming compensation for the debts incurred by the second brother due to the sale. This is mentioned for your reference. As for how to settle the commemorative meeting, it should be fairly decided by the court. The relevant legal provisions of the precedent are as follows:</p>

<p>(Summary) The debt originally agreed upon by the parties in the occupied area to be paid in puppet currency should be settled in legal currency according to the ratio of puppet currency to legal currency stipulated by the government, but it does not hinder the application of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Lawsuits after Recovery.</p>
<p>Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Lawsuits after Recovery (promulgated by the National Government on December 18, 34th year)</p>
<p>(Article 12) After the establishment of a legal act, if the circumstances change so greatly due to reasons not attributable to the parties that it could not have been foreseen, and it is obviously unfair to maintain its original effect, the court should fairly decide to increase or decrease the commemorative meeting, or change other original effects.</p>

<p>Second Allocation of Yarn Completed; Third Plan Undecided; Mayor Wu Talks About Textile Management Policy; Focusing on the Development of Yarn and Cloth; Allocation Price Must Take into Account Factory Profits</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The second group allocation of yarn by the Yarn Factory Joint Sales Committee was the last time yesterday. A total of 898 pieces were sold by private factories, and 633 pieces were sold by the Textile Construction Company. The selling price remained unchanged. The yarn sold by the Textile Construction Company is targeted at the dyeing and weaving industry, No. 1 to 265, 20-count Baoguang, and No. 267 to 311, 20-count Yangsi, No. 312 to 432, 42-count Shuiyue; the knitting industry, No. 1 to 110, 32-count Yanghe, No. 111 to 171, 32-count Funv; and the handkerchief industry, No. 1 to 43, 40-count Baoguang, and No. 44 to 73, 40-count Shuangniao. After the meeting, Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Sixth District Machinery Textile Industry Association, told reporters: The plan for the third group allocation of yarn has not yet been decided. Everything must wait until the Textile Industry Management Committee convenes a meeting next week before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>This reporter then visited the newly appointed director of the Textile Management Committee, Mayor Wu, who agreed to meet. When the reporter asked about the future plans of the Textile Management Committee and the date of the meeting, he humbly said: He is an amateur in the yarn and cloth industry and is very afraid that he will not be completely satisfied when he first takes office. However, if he is given a little time, he will do his best to eliminate the black market for yarn and cloth. Regarding the future regulations on the allocation price of yarn and cloth, in addition to considering its cost and legal profits, he will definitely consider the profits that can develop the industry. He said: Although my country's textile industry is said to have 5 million spindles, less than half of them are actually operating. Given the vastness of my country's territory and the size of its population, at least 10 million spindles are needed. Therefore, if the profit for developing the industry is not taken into account when determining the price of yarn and cloth, how can the textile industry develop? Regarding the entire yarn and cloth problem, he hopes to start with fair allocation in Shanghai and then gradually promote it to all parts of the country.</p>
<p>According to Mayor Wu, as of yesterday, the municipal government has only received one statistical report from the Towel and Blanket Industry Association. He said that the statistical data reported by several associations recently ordered by the municipal government often contain false information. For the amount of demand, most of the reports are exaggerated. The municipal government is determined to thoroughly investigate and crack down on this.</p>
<p>Sluggish Sales of Yarn and Cloth; Local and Foreign Market Prices Inverted</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was sluggish and very depressed because the market prices in various places turned upside down. The price of 400-pound standard 20-count yarn fell by 230,000 yuan again due to the end of the year. However, heavy-weight goods were absorbed by some gangs, and the special Double Horse brand remained stable and still managed to break through the 2.3 million yuan mark. Fine yarn was weak at first and then firm, finally trading at 2.31 million yuan. 16-count yarn was extremely sluggish and continued to fall by about 80,000 yuan. The double yarn was similar to yesterday. The yarn market has temporarily entered a volatile phase.</p>
<p>The cloth market has been declining in price for several days. Although there were slightly more buyers yesterday, the price still did not rise. Because the price in this city has exceeded the price in foreign cities, all gangs are holding a wait-and-see attitude because there is no profit to be made. Gangs in Yantai, Tianjin, and other places took the opportunity to sell off their goods before they were shipped, which could still make a profit. As a result, the price became even weaker. In the market, no one was interested in fine cloth, and there were few transactions for Four Gentlemen Serge. It is estimated that the asking price for Dragon Head brand is 86,000 yuan, and for Serge, 93,000 yuan. Given the current market situation, it will be difficult to improve for a while.</p>
<p>Government Bonds Gradually Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday's government bond trading saw some large players buying on the fifth floor and some selling on the seventh floor, showing a struggle. The Tong Bing bonds opened in the morning at slightly above 2,000 yuan and gradually rose from 2,000 yuan, reaching 2,300 yuan midway before encountering supply. They struggled within 2,150 yuan, and the result was 210 yuan better than the previous closing. A and B bonds rose slightly by 20 yuan, Tong Ding rose by 70 yuan, and Tong Wu also rose by 120 yuan.</p>
<p>Gold and Paper Money Firm</p>
<p>The black market price of gold yesterday was even more stable, with a narrow fluctuation. It opened in the morning at 2.215 million yuan, but it was very quiet, hovering around 2.21 million yuan. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank sold 100 taels at a price of 2.2 million yuan, which also had little impact. It once fell to 2.195 million yuan near noon, but still stood at about 2.2 million yuan at noon. The afternoon was even more stable. The next-day delivery price rose slightly, ending at 2.21 million yuan. The result was 5,000 yuan less than the previous closing. The exchange rate against the US dollar was about 539 yuan per ten taels. The price of gold ornaments, silver ingots, and silver dollars was the same as the previous day. The underground interest rate first loosened and then tightened, still ranging from 1.5 to 1.8 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign currency was very quiet. The buying price of US dollars in the retail market was 3,500 yuan, but there were no purchases, and transactions were still difficult to start. The black market price has retreated to below 4,100 yuan. The afternoon was mediocre with little change, and the result was slightly lower than the previous closing. Hong Kong dollars were very stable, first low and then high, and the result was similar to the previous closing. The Hong Kong exchange rate was still fixed at around 890 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 1,060 yuan to 1,080 yuan, and yarn and flower gangs made purchases. The British exchange rate was 14,000 yuan to 14,200 yuan, but there were not many transactions. The official exchange rate of the US dollar was not changed, and the transaction was still silent.</p>
<p>Lining Flourishing</p>
<p>Due to the limited production and inventory of woolen fabrics and the approaching winter sales season, supply is often unable to meet demand, and the market is trending upwards. Western suit linings, such as black carbon linings, French-style linings, gray soft linings, printed cotton cloth, sleeve linings, horsehair interlinings, silk-glossed feather yarn, satin backings, and bright satin, have all risen in price. In fact, even though the price has risen, there is a lack of spot goods, because the weaving volume of general factories is less than before due to environmental factors.</p>
<p>Reassessment of Raw Silk Prices May Be Held Next Week</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Representatives from the Central Trust Bureau, the Central Bank of China Silk Corporation, the Ministry of Economic Affairs Commodity Inspection Bureau, and four other agencies held a meeting at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM and decided on the following prices for purchasing raw silk in the future: (Unit: 1,000 yuan, calculated per dan)</p>

<p>A Grade 4,550</p>
<p>B Grade 4,175</p>
<p>C Grade 3,975</p>
<p>D Grade 3,800</p>
<p>E Grade 3,600</p>
<p>F Grade 3,400</p>
<p>When reporters asked relevant people about their thoughts on this stipulated price, they replied: Spring silk may have a slight profit, while autumn silk will have a slight loss. It was said that there were two hours of discussion yesterday, and it is possible that a meeting will be held again next Tuesday to discuss it again.</p>
<p>Golden Needles Tighten</p>
<p>Recently, due to the small amount of golden needle vegetable available and the lack of activity in winter sales, dealers have gradually increased their purchases. Yesterday, some goods were released in the market, and the price has risen to 170,000 to 180,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Tongkang Money Shop Liquidation; Exchange Stopped Yesterday</p>
<p>Tongkang Money Shop in Jiyang Lane, Henan Road, has been stopped from exchanging due to a recent liquidity failure. The bill exchange has been sent out by the clearing house before 9:00 AM yesterday. The shop is proceeding with clearing debts and handling various follow-up matters. After the news of the shop's suspension of exchange spread, there were various rumors outside, some saying that it was caused by a failure in gold speculation. According to an employee of the shop: it was entirely due to liquidity issues. It is said that the shop is short of more than 200 million yuan this time.</p>
<p>Ship Goods Failed to Open; Rice Market Shows Strength Again</p>
<p>The rice market did not see a boom in both arrivals and sales. Registered orders amounted to only more than 6,000 piculs. Indica rice is in a firm position, but lower-grade goods are weak. The issue of laborers at Hexia has not yet been resolved, resulting in a failure to open the boats. Glutinous rice shops continued to be active. Du glutinous rice, sheep glutinous rice, and port glutinous rice all showed strength. High-grade customers were happy with the price of glutinous rice, but the price of medium-grade glutinous rice was low. White yuan glutinous rice was firm, and black yuan glutinous rice was very popular. The inventory of soybeans was still available, but it was still difficult to add color and break away from the sluggish situation. The arrival of wheat was still bleak. Sales of northern wheat declined, and southern wheat was also weak. The market was peaceful. There were very few transactions of mung beans, which were still depressed. Sales of red sorghum were also weak, falling by 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame was still weak. The price of high-grade raw peanuts was stable, while the price of medium and lower-grade peanuts fell again by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. After continuous declines, the retail sales of moths turned strong and slightly rebounded by 1,000 yuan. Cowpeas were the most sluggish, falling by 1,000 yuan. Corn also fell slightly by 300 to 500 yuan. There was no change in bran. Bean cakes were stable. Slightly more raw oil arrived, and people's hearts were turning soft, so it fell by 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil were about the same.</p>
<p>Export of Soybeans Still Under Preliminary Study</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Central Trust Bureau has made a preliminary study on the export of soybeans from Northeast China, but relevant people said that the matter is still far from being realized. The biggest difficulties for export are the lack of transportation tools and the high cost, which makes them unpopular overseas.</p>
<p>Caustic Soda Continues to Rise by 40,000</p>
<p>The price of caustic soda rose again yesterday, increasing by about 40,000 yuan per barrel. The previous rumor that a foreign company was distributing goods failed to materialize. The demand from local users and merchants was quite strong. According to people in the industry, the market price of caustic soda overseas has been rising continuously, making it difficult to expect the price to fall. It is currently the peak sales season, and the inventory is not large, so it is difficult to contain the rising trend. Siling's Australian imports were previously said to have arrived in small quantities, but there is no definite date yet. Merchants are vigorously seeking bleaching powder, and prices from all sides are not falling, so the price is bound to rise.</p>
<p>Brown Sugar Continues to Tighten</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was stable. Brown sugar continued to be tight due to scarce goods. The association adjusted the spot price of medium-grade white sand to 135,000 yuan to 5,500 yuan, raw sand to 114,500 yuan, high-grade Shantou gang raised the price of green-infused sugar by 120,000 yuan, up 1,000 yuan, Chong-infused green sugar by 118,000 yuan, totaling hundreds of packages. The Guangdong gang raised the price of green sugar slices from Shimen by 97,000 yuan, the Jian gang raised the price of Diaoqing by 110,000 yuan, up 1,000 yuan, and the Yu gang raised the price of Gaoxing red sugar by 130,000 yuan, Zhongzhuang sugar by 127,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan, totaling 200 to 300 baskets.</p>

<p>Longs Close High; Hua Shares Rise and Fall Unevenly</p>
<p>Hua shares fluctuated quite a bit yesterday. There was still pressure from shorts in the middle, making it impossible to rally. The slight stability at the opening in the morning still could not last. The situation gradually weakened after 10:00 AM. Some overnight longs closed high, gradually falling back. The volume suddenly decreased in the middle of trading, so people's hearts were pessimistic, and the shorts were able to show their power, repeatedly lowering the price. Maya retreated to the 4,000 yuan mark, Yongsha to 733 yuan, Jingfu to 263 yuan, Xinguang to 269 yuan, and Qinzhen to 180 yuan before stabilizing. The situation slightly improved after 11:30 AM. Banks such as China General Commerce bought, so short covering gradually rose, allowing the price to rise. Near noon, the price rose again as people scrambled for profits, but it did not exceed the initial high price in the morning. Compared to the previous closing, the gains and losses of the hot shares were small. In the afternoon, the market immediately collapsed, and the rapid advance caused those who closed high to make a profit, and the profit-takers sold off one after another. After the high, the market gradually narrowed, causing panic among floating longs, and the situation was not very favorable. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the hot shares, Maya, Xinguang, and Qin, fell slightly, Yongsha rose slightly, Jingfu was flat, and Xinhe rose by slightly more than 1%. Among the cold stocks, Zhongfang and Tongyi rose by half a percent, and Rongfeng Matches, Yonggong, Lianan, Wuhe, and Huafeng all rose slightly. Datong was flat, and there were no transactions for Zhongsi throughout the day. Xin Ya Cement and underwear fell slightly, and Jinglun rose by slightly more than half a percent. The total turnover in the front and rear markets was 1.181 million shares. Among the shares outside the market, except for slight declines in Commercial Press and Nanyang, the rest were flat.</p>
<p>Foreign shares were firm at first and then weak, with more transactions and a slightly more active situation. As a result, compared to the previous closing, United British Brewers rose by half a percent, while Yisha, Jardine Matheson, Wharf, Steel Industry, and Shipping were flat, and the paper industry fell slightly.</p>
<p>Central Bank's Policy Remains Unchanged; Does Not Compete with Ordinary Commercial Banks; The Focus of the Bank Affairs Meeting is on Reviewing Business</p>
<p>The third Bank Affairs Meeting held by the Central Bank in Nanjing opened on the 11th of this month and will be fully reviewed by today. It will close on the 20th. Currently, all parties attach great importance to the bank's meeting. According to the person in charge of the bank: The bank's business has been striving to advance the mission of the bank. (1) Regarding deposits, the bank does not compete with ordinary commercial banks in order to establish the central banking system, so all deposits are mainly from the industry. (2) Regarding loans, the bank provides loans to all industries and export industries that have normal needs. The recent industrial and commercial loans are one example, which is to handle so-called re-mortgage and rediscount, but in order to prevent speculation or misappropriation, ordinary loans are not handled.</p>
<p>Real Estate Is Not Mortgaged for the Time Being, Ordinary Loans Are Not Made</p>
<p>For the time being, ordinary loans are not made. Some people hope that loans do not require collateral or mortgage of real estate, but this is not possible under the current legal restrictions. (3) Regarding remittances, in order to avoid the concentration of floating capital in Shanghai, causing trouble, restrictions still have to be imposed on remittances from various places, but legitimate needs can still be taken care of. The total amount of monthly remittances is huge. Recently, in order to facilitate the allocation of commercial banks, the remittance rate is planned to be reduced to 70% as prescribed. (4) Regarding the export industry, the bank attaches great importance to it. In order to support exporters in developing international trade and strive for balance in international payments, three types of loans have been organized: the first is packing loans, which are handled when exporters transport export materials to Shanghai;</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 18th] The various circles of Hangzhou City knew as early as ten days ago that Ambassador Stuart would return to his second hometown (Hangzhou) on the 18th of this month, so all preparations were made early. Yesterday morning, the weather was clear and warm as spring. At 7:00 AM, a special car to welcome the ambassador went to the Qiaotou Air Force Officer School airport to await his arrival. When our reporter's special car arrived at the Qiaotou Aviation School at 9:00 AM, the school's Education Director, Hu Weike, first explained all the preparations made for the ambassador's special plane to arrive at the airport. Then, Education Director Hu first invited Chairman Shen of the Zhejiang Provincial Government to walk to the airport to pre-inspect the school's officers and students and honor guard, totaling more than four thousand people.

After the photo was taken, the C47 aircraft of the Development Center arrived over Hangzhou City. When the door opened, Ambassador Stuart took his hat and cane, and after getting off the plane, Hu's daughter, Hu Chang, presented flowers, and people's organizations presented welcome letters. Mr. Stuart repeatedly said, "Thank you." Then, after the band played the American and Chinese national anthems, Chairman Shen accompanied him to inspect the military appearance standing on the left side of the road. He then went to the lounge for breakfast. General Director Wang Kuisheng of the Youth Association specially introduced our reporter to Ambassador Stuart. Mr. Stuart, speaking fluent Hangzhou dialect, smiled and said to the reporter, "Today is truly clear and refreshing, but you will have to work hard again." He then told the reporter, "It was very comfortable in the plane. Besides reading the newspaper, I looked down on the beautiful lakes and mountains of my former birthplace." Ambassador Stuart then had breakfast on the sofa and talked with Chairman Shen for ten minutes.

Then, he drove into Hangzhou City. At twelve o'clock, he attended a banquet at the Foreign Affairs Reception Center hosted by the Municipal Government. In the afternoon, he drove to the tomb of Jiulimiao. Those who came to Hangzhou on the same plane this time included Colonel Weideman, American News Service photographer Li De, and Nanjing Central Daily News reporter Zhu Xiuyu.

<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 18th] After Ambassador Stuart arrived in Hangzhou, he took a short rest at the Foreign Guest Reception Center.

After the meal, Stuart met with our reporter alone and said: He has not returned to Hangzhou for ten years. Today, it is like meeting old acquaintances, the rivers and mountains are still the same, and the scenery is as beautiful as before, which is very comforting. The purpose of this visit is to worship the graves of my parents and brothers in Jiulimiao and take a short rest so that I can work hard for China's future again. The reporter then asked about the current state of the country. He replied: I intend to remain silent for the time being and will proceed after Shao Lizi and Wu Tiecheng return to Beijing. He personally remains optimistic about China's future. As for the matter of Ambassador Stuart becoming an honorary citizen of Hangzhou City, he said he felt very honored. Finally, he told the reporter that he had decided to fly to Beijing on the 21st to work hard for peace talks again.

<h3>Colbert Will Come East</h3>
<p>Still Believes in a Secret Potsdam Agreement</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 17th] Colbert of the American China Policy Association still believes that there is indeed a secret Potsdam agreement regarding China. Mr. Colbert will set off for the Far East in an attempt to obtain the truth about the terms of the agreement from the Chinese government.

<h3>Black Market Price of Rayon Drops to 6-7 Million, But No Transactions Result</h3>
<p>The price of rayon fell sharply yesterday. The morning market was quite chaotic, and prices varied. The price of 120 Tianqiao Bright Rayon in the afternoon was announced to be 3.45 million yuan, but no transactions were made at this price. It was 600,000 yuan lower than the previous day, and the semi-gloss and other types were more than 700,000 yuan lower. The price of 75 semi-gloss was originally short, but now it has been raised to be on par with 120 semi-gloss. Factory transactions were quite deserted. However, the price of CD grade was 100,000 yuan higher yesterday. The price of 44/42 D grade orders was 3.95 million yuan, and the price of 30 dry warp 5 dan was 2.85 million yuan, which was 50,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The sale of silk goods was very popular. The price of rayon goods fell due to the drop in raw material prices. The price of Minsheng Xinyan brocade was slightly lower by 2,000 yuan per piece, the price of Hua Jin crepe was slightly lower by 100 yuan per yard, and the rest were flat.</p>
<p>China Trust now sets to allocate 2,000 boxes to the silk weaving industry every month. 1,000 boxes will be allocated and sold this month. The first batch of allocated goods totaled 640 boxes and 08 packages the day before yesterday. The allocation and purchase orders have been sent to the Silk Weaving Association for distribution yesterday, and payment and delivery are limited to this morning.</p>
<p>There are still 360 boxes left for allocation this month, which can still be applied for by the silk weaving industry next Monday (purchase is available every Monday and Thursday). The original proposal to allocate to silk merchants has been temporarily cancelled because the market price has fallen sharply. The price per dan is only 3.2 million yuan and there are few inquiries, and the factories already have enough supply, so there is no need to purchase from the market.</p>
<p>In addition, there are requests for allocation and sale from other places besides Hangzhou, such as Shengze. The Bureau is currently conducting an investigation, and a decision may be made next week.</p>
<h3>Exchanging Textile Information, Sending Experts to Visit British Representatives, China Hopes for Three Things from Britain</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs dispatched experts Zhang Sili and Zhang Diaogong to Beijing by night train on the 16th to discuss with the textile industry representatives of the British Business Delegation. This trip also brought a memorandum, which described in detail the situation of China's textile equipment production and future needs, which will be handed over to the British representatives, and they will be asked to provide general information on the British textile industry. Official sources said: China needs Britain's assistance in three areas: (1) In terms of tools, emerging countries are competing and are actively replacing new machines, and plan to obtain a part from Japan; therefore, what China hopes from Britain is only the supply of various parts for textile machines. (2) In terms of raw materials, the quality of Indian cotton is not good, and China does not hope for it. What it currently expects to supply is Australian wool. (3) China is very willing to draw on the excellent technology and long-term accumulated experience of the British textile industry.</p>
<h3>Food and Transportation Industries Must Pay Business Tax</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, 17th] The Ministry of Finance previously issued an order to exempt the transportation industry from business tax for one year. According to reliable information, the Ministry of Finance recently believed that the scope of food production areas in various places has expanded, and the recovery transportation has also reached the expected plan, and the exemption of the tax has expired. It ordered the local direct tax bureaus to collect business tax from this October for the manufacturing and sales of wheat, bean flour, sorghum flour, corn flour, and other food industries, as well as the transportation industry.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Plummets, Bulls Close Positions and Short Selling</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 17th] Cotton futures fell sharply today due to strong selling pressure, closing down $8.80 to $10 per bale.</p>
<p>[Also, New Orleans, 17th] Cotton futures closed down $2.50 to $10 per bale today.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, New York, part of the reason for the price drop was that bulls closed their positions to prevent losses, and another reason was that there was a lot of short selling in the market to seek to buy back at lower prices.</p>
<h3>Locally Made Imitation of Taiwan Red Tea, Yulong and Ruichang Both Buy In</h3>
<p>Since the supply of B.O.P. marked Taiwan fine red tea has stopped, there is a strong demand for Indian tea. Local tea factories are putting imitations on the market. Currently, Chunyuan and other tea shops are packaging about 800 boxes for Yulong and Ruichang Foreign Firms. The price is 140,000 to 150,000 yuan per dan.

<h3>Notice for Importing Radios, The Customs Clearance Procedures are Extremely Complicated</h3>
<p>Recently, some passengers have been importing radios. Due to a lack of understanding of customs clearance procedures, the customs have often discovered and detained them. According to customs information, regarding passengers importing radios, they should first fill out an import declaration form (one white, one green, and one red verification form), then go to the Import Supervisor's Office on the second floor of this Customs House to submit the declaration form, and then go to the Valuation Department, Group 3 for valuation. After the valuation is completed, after obtaining the tax payment certificate, apply to the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation at 872 Yokohama Bridge for a passport. After obtaining the passport, go to the tax collection office on the ground floor of this Customs House and pay the tax with the tax payment certificate. After paying the tax, hand over the first and second copies of the tax payment receipt and the passport to the Deputy General Affairs Counter of this Customs House to cancel the passport. After the cancellation is completed, the Deputy General Affairs Counter will send someone to the Import Release Office on the second floor of this Customs House to collect the release receipt before going to the Daguan Wharf to retrieve the radio.</p>
<h3>Kerosene and Diesel Rise Together</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of gasoline at gas stations has increased by 150 yuan per gallon, and the retail price of five-gallon kerosene has also increased by 1,000 yuan. The retail price of diesel varies greatly, ranging from 320,000 to 360,000 yuan per ton in bulk. The price of barrelled diesel depends on the quality of the iron barrel. The price of the original new barrel is 26,000 yuan higher than the bulk price, and the price of the second-rate barrel is about 20,000 yuan. According to people in the industry, most of the sales to retail merchants are in small quantities. If the quantity is more than 20 or 30 tons, the transportation cost is relatively low, so the unit price is also reduced accordingly. The prices of retail kerosene at gas stations in this city have not yet been determined, so they are not sold temporarily.</p>

<h3>Winning Streak Continues: Qunsheng Defeats Huasheng in First Battle; Tianjin Team Suffers a Setback with 52-41 Score; Too Many Points Lost in First Half, Impossible to Recover</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Qunsheng Basketball Team continues to maintain its winning streak. The strong Tianjin team, Huasheng, failed to break their line after a fierce battle of forty minutes last night and were defeated by Qunsheng with a score of 52-41. In the first half, Qunsheng took a significant lead of 36-13. There were approximately over four thousand spectators last night, and the atmosphere was lively and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Qunsheng Controls the Game</p>
<p>Throughout the entire game, Qunsheng maintained control. Initially, it was close, with scores tied at 4-4, 5-5, and 7-7, but Qunsheng gradually pulled ahead. In the first quarter, the score was 15-9. In the second quarter, under Qunsheng's fierce attack, Huasheng's entire line collapsed and fell into chaos. Qunsheng took a lead of 36-13 in the first half, a difference of 23 points. In the second half, Huasheng gradually improved, while Qunsheng did not press too hard, and the score gradually narrowed. The third quarter ended with a score of 42-27, and the final result was 52-41.</p>
<p>Offense and Defense Both Show Differences</p>
<p>Qunsheng once again demonstrated their sharp and agile novel tactics last night. Huasheng failed to utilize their height advantage and frequently committed fouls. Under Qunsheng's lightning-fast attacks, Huasheng's entire line was flustered and chaotic. Their five-man zone defense provided Qunsheng with the best offensive opportunities. In the second half, they switched to man-to-man marking, and the situation gradually improved. However, they were on the defensive, and under Qunsheng's strict defense, they often struggled to get the ball into the basket. Their long shots, such as Wang Hongbin passing to Chuan Jinsheng, were indeed excellent performances, but they lacked opportunities to showcase their skills. Liu Xueqi, the top center in North China, failed to perform at all last night and was far below his usual standard.</p>
<p>Qunsheng Afraid of the Huge Momentum</p>
<p>Huasheng fielded Liu Xueqi, Wang Hongbin, Chuan Jinsheng, Wang Youcai, and Wang Kanruo, while Qunsheng fielded Chen Jinde, Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, and Yang Renhui. After exchanging pennants, the game began. Chen Jinde scored four points with consecutive free throws, while Liu Xueqi and Wang Youcai showed excellent marksmanship, tying the score at 4-4. The score then became 5-5 and 7-7. Qunsheng's Wenhua and Wenzhang scored repeatedly, and the score steadily increased. Huasheng relied on Lai Hongbin scoring a goal, and the first quarter ended with Qunsheng leading 15-9. In the second quarter, Huasheng replaced Wang Youcai with Guo Jinming. Qunsheng seized the opportunity and scored, with Wenchang excelling on both sides, leading the team to 28-12. Huasheng replaced Wang Kanruo with Wang Youcai, but they were already far behind Qunsheng. The first half ended with 36-13, with Qunsheng taking a significant lead.</p>
<p>Huasheng Unable to Catch Up</p>
<p>After the break, the game resumed. Huasheng replaced Liu Xueqi with Yin Huanwen. Wang Hongbin and Wang Youcai each scored a point. Qunsheng called their first timeout. Huasheng was still active, and Jinsheng and Youcai scored repeatedly with long shots. The third quarter ended with 27-42, with the Tianjin team catching up by a few points. In the final quarter, Huasheng brought Liu Xueqi back into the game, replacing Yin Huanwen. Before long, Chuan Jinsheng fouled out with five fouls. Wang Hongbin scored two more impressive points. Qunsheng replaced Chen Jinde with Zhang Yuyi. Jinde scored under the basket, and Hongbin and Youcai scored with long shots, narrowing the score to 37-47. Qunsheng called a timeout. Chen Jinde replaced Cai Wenhua. At this point, the game was intense, and Yang Renhui, Wang Youcai, and Cai Wenzhang were all dismissed with five fouls. Soon, the regulation time expired, and Qunsheng defeated Huasheng with a score of 52-41.</p>

<h3>Japanese Girl Saga Hiroko in a Conspiracy Drama of Japanese-Puppet Intermarriage</h3>
<p>— Wu Boxiang</p>
<p>The Northeast Without Cherry Blossoms Unveils the Secrets of the Puppet Manchu Imperial Family</p>
<p>Saga Hiroko is the Japanese wife of Pujie, the younger brother of Puyi, the puppet Manchu emperor. The news of her being escorted from the Northeast to Shanghai has been published by the Central News Agency in various Shanghai newspapers. Having personally experienced this matter, I would like to write down what I have heard and known, so that the general readers can have a clear understanding of the puppet Manchu imperial family.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1937, the Japanese cherry blossoms were withering on the land of Northeast China, unable to bloom the so-called symbol of Japan. However, a major political conspiracy was rapidly being pushed forward in the cold spring of Changchun! On March 1st, the "Succession Law of the Manchu Empire Imperial Family" was promulgated, and on April 3rd, Pujie's wedding ceremony was suddenly announced in Tokyo. These two events were inextricably linked politically: First, Article 5 of the Succession Law stipulated that "If the emperor dies without descendants, his throne shall be succeeded by his younger brother and his descendants." It was well known that the puppet emperor Puyi could not have children. Therefore, it was undoubtedly certain that Pujie would succeed the puppet emperor after Puyi's death. However, Pujie's marriage partner happened to be a Japanese noblewoman. Therefore, Japanese politicians boasted about this political wedding ceremony as a way to strengthen Japanese-Manchu cooperation and implement Japanese-Manchu intermarriage. However, the compatriots in the Northeast were troubled by this grand wedding ceremony. More than forty years ago, the old drama of "Japanese-Korean Imperial Intermarriage" was about to be replayed in the Northeast. If Pujie's Japanese wife gave birth to a child who became the next generation of puppet emperor, then, just like the "Japanese-Korean Merger," Japan could legitimately annex the Northeast. The Japanese politicians and the Kwantung Army even selected Saga Hiroko as the female protagonist in this major political conspiracy. At the age of twenty-four, after graduating from Gakushuin, she was studying oil painting with Okada Saburo. Because she was a descendant of Fujiwara Kamatari, and her grandfather, Marquis Saga Kinkatsu, had served as the president of the House of Peers, she was an ideal female protagonist in all aspects. Therefore, through the matchmaking of Honjo Shigeru, the commander of the Kwantung Army, she married Pujie.</p>
<p>Her fate was destined to be unhappy and to suffer. The year after the wedding, rumors spread that she was pregnant and about to give birth. The Kwantung Army authorities began planning the future imperial family of the "Manchu Empire." Unfortunately, she gave birth to a girl. A year later, at the end of March 1939, she gave birth for the second time, and it was another girl. The Kwantung Army was suspicious and disappointed in her. Their solicitous attitude turned cold. She was still young, and she hoped to give birth to a boy for the third time to reverse her fate. She continued to hope so until Japan surrendered.</p>
<p>Saga Hiroko Recounts the Truth of the Marriage</p>
<p>A Japanese woman sacrificed by policy, she herself recounts the circumstances of her marriage to Pujie as follows:</p>
<p>"Among my relatives, there was a Marquis Nakayama who came to my house to ask for my photo, saying that he was introducing me to a suitable person to be my matchmaker. My family was an absolutely old-fashioned feudal family. Marriage arranged by parents was a matter of course. I had no room to object.</p>
<p>The daughter of Mr. Okata, the director of the gastroenterology hospital, was a good friend of the Third Princess. Because I knew Miss Okata, I got to know Puyi's younger sister, the Third Princess, and I learned more about Pujie. My parents said that he was a good young man, and it was difficult to find such a person even among Japanese young men. The sons of wealthy families often become纨绔子弟, and they hoped that I would not object to this marriage. At the same time, Mr. Shioya Atsushi of the Gakushuin (school for children of Japanese nobles) boys' department also praised him as an outstanding young man. I still remember that from that time on, we began to socialize. The first time we met was at my house, and my father (Marquis Saga Sanekatsu) was very happy. At that time, he ordered me to marry him. Because he had studied in Japan for a long time, he had completely learned Japanese customs, and he said that there was no imperial law in the Manchu Empire, and that he lived like an ordinary commoner, so I decided to marry him and become an ordinary Manchu wife in the future.</p>
<p>After that meeting, Pujie became a member of my family. My three younger sisters and brother treated him like their own elder brother. When he came, we would chat together or go for a walk together.</p>
<p>On April 3, 1937, the wedding ceremony was held at the Military Hall in Kudan, Tokyo. I remember that the initial matchmaker was Marquis Nakayama, but during the ceremony, General Honjo Shigeru (Commander of the Kwantung Army during the September 18 Incident) came forward as the introducer. At that time, the cabinet ministers of the Hayashi Cabinet, including the Prime Minister and all ministers, attended."</p>
<p>Post-Marriage Life Repeatedly Interfered with by the Japanese</p>
<p>She also said: "After the wedding, my husband Pujie went to the Chiba Infantry School to study. We had a residence in Momi River, near Chiba. He was a lieutenant in the army. Our life was like that of an ordinary middle-class person. We only hired one maid, and I still did the cooking myself. He went to school every day and took the train to school with ordinary students. Looking back now, I feel that life was very happy at that time. I was born in an old-fashioned Japanese noble family, and he grew up in an old-fashioned imperial family, so there was not much difference in customs, and I did not feel that there was much difficulty.</p>
<p>In October, we came to Manchuria. We held another banquet at the military hall in Changchun, which was considered a wedding ceremony in Manchuria. At that time, all the important figures of the Manchu State attended the ceremony. However, the Commander of the Kwantung Army at the time (Ueda Kenkichi) did not seem to be present. Then, we went to meet Emperor Puyi and also met his family in the palace.</p>
<p>Once I arrived in Northeast China, I felt that I was not free. It turned out that the Japanese in Northeast China and the Japanese in mainland Japan seemed to be two different races. The difference in attitude and spirit surprised and discouraged me. For example, Lieutenant Colonel Yoshioka (a special agent sent by the Kwantung Army to the puppet Manchu palace, then still a lieutenant colonel) interfered with every trivial matter in our family. I was angry and annoyed, but what could I do?</p>
<p>No. 117 Xiwantai Street in Changchun, a room the size of eight mats, was our residence. It was a military officer's residence of the Kwantung Army. Like the general Kwantung Army lieutenant colonels, we were assigned one building. The house was too small. Even my husband's study could not be separated. Without a private car, we hired only one servant and lived a hard life.</p>
<p>On February 26th, the fifth year of Kangde (1937), my eldest daughter Huie was born. As a mother, I was busy taking care of my child. Because the child was Chinese, I, as a Japanese mother, was confused about how to educate her and it was not easy to solve. Relying on my natural maternal love, I loved my child. In December, my husband was transferred to be the military attaché of the Manchu State Embassy in Japan. My family and I moved to Wakamatsu-cho, Ushigome-ku, Tokyo, and lived a free life for a whole year. On March 18, the sixth year of Kangde (1938), my second daughter was born in Tokyo. Two months before, my husband was ordered to be transferred to be the deputy director of the Fengtian Training School, so I, the parturient, came to China after recovering.</p>
<p>In the ninth year of Kangde (1941), my husband went to the Japanese Army War College to study. The family moved to Tokyo again and lived in Tanuki-ana-cho, Azabu-ku. (Tanuki-ana-cho is the location of embassies of various countries.) The following year, my eldest daughter Huie was seven years old and went to the Women's Gakushuin.</p>
<p>The war had reached a difficult climax. During the wartime life, we relied on rations, which were better than the average Japanese household in both quality and quantity.</p>
<p>In December, even the Army War College stopped classes. Except for my eldest daughter Huie, who stayed in Tokyo's Shitaya-ku due to schoolwork, entrusted to her maternal grandparents, we decided to leave dangerous Japan and come to Manchuria again. At that time, the traffic situation was all in a dangerous state, and we had to risk taking a plane. After arriving in Northeast China, I breathed a sigh of relief. Tokyo had terrible air raids, and it was much safer in Manchuria.</p>
<p>In fact, we were unwilling to live in China. In Japan, if we were commoners, we would live very freely, but once we arrived in Manchuria, we would be treated badly everywhere. The Japanese treated my Chinese husband, even though he was the emperor's brother, with arrogance. In August, Japan surrendered, and my husband left me until today."</p>

<h3>"Imperial Relatives and Nobility" Fleeing</h3>
<p>Yet Still Ended Up "Unable to Escape"</p>
<p>On the night of August 10, 1945, the puppet Manchu palace was filled with unprecedented commotion and unease. People from the Kwantung Army came to say that the Soviet army had launched a war on the border, and Changchun would become the front line. So Saga Hiro, with her seven-year-old daughter Huisheng, followed Puyi, Hongqiu (the puppet empress), other imperial relatives, and "Palace Affairs Department" officials, a total of more than 200 people, and in the darkness mistakenly boarded a train to start fleeing to Tonghua. Lieutenant General Yoshioka and others were the escorts of this fleeing group, a mighty procession. A large number of real objects, luggage, and personnel from the puppet palace transferred trains at Siping Street and went straight to Tonghua because Tonghua was only over a hundred kilometers by train from Ji'an. The planned route was to escape to Korea via the upper reaches of the Yalu River railway at Ji'an. They imagined that the situation would not be so serious, so they got off the train at Dazhuzi, requisitioned a large number of civilian houses, and set up a temporary "Palace Affairs Department." The railway staff were all Japanese, the 800,000 Kwantung Army still existed, and the Japanese police were still the local authorities. On August 15, Emperor Hirohito's surrender edict was transmitted to Dazhuzi by radio waves. This fleeing group panicked. Yoshioka took Japanese military police and male members of the puppet imperial family with Puyi to Changchun to make a decision. Unexpectedly, Soviet military aircraft were waiting in Changchun, catching them all in one fell swoop and transporting them all to Soviet territory. Perhaps Dazhuzi was too remote to interest the Red Army. Saga Hiro, accompanied by Puyi's wife Hongqiu, concubine Li, and others, was safe and sound under the protection of the Japanese police.</p>
<p>On the 10th, snow had covered the northeast. This group of more than 200 despondent "imperial relatives" left Dazhuzi and fled to Tonghua. At that time, the CCP army appeared in Linjiang. Like fish escaping the net, they entered another net. After their property and luggage were inventoried, she lived with the Communist army. In half a year, the Communist army changed teams several times. Their fleeing "imperial relative" group had almost disintegrated. Eunuchs, maids, and attendants all went their separate ways. She took her child and came to Changchun with the Communist army on April 24 to see her former residence and inquire about her husband Pujie's news. As soon as Puyi's "Noble Consort Li" arrived in Changchun, she immediately returned to her family's pancake shop. Only six people were left in Saga Hiro's group, including Hongqiu. The Communist army took them to Jilin. The day after the Kuomintang planes appeared over Jilin, she fled to Yanji with the Communist army headquarters, separating from Hongqiu. In mid-May, they went from Yanji to Mudanjiang, and then to Jiamusi. There, she met many war criminals held by the Communist army, such as Okada, president of the puppet Xingye Bank, Xiao Teng, president of Mantuo, and Miura, president of the Red Cross. On July 2, she arrived in Harbin from Jiamusi, seemingly breaking away from her "imperial" connections and becoming an ordinary Japanese overseas resident, because she had changed her name to Hamaguchi Mikiko, and her seven-year-old daughter Huisheng had also changed her name to Hamaguchi Asako.</p>
<h3>Maid Betrays Her: Saga Captured</h3>
<p>After Saga Hiro arrived in Harbin, she stayed at the Red Swastika Temple, where a maid, Kumamoto Masakimi, was introduced by the Japanese Overseas Residents Association to serve her. The local Japanese tried every means to protect her, because in the feudal eyes of the Japanese, it was a great honor to be able to show courtesy to a noble. On August 25, she moved from the Red Swastika Temple to the Mian's house in Daoli, Harbin, to live in seclusion.</p>
<p>In mid-August, the government and the CCP agreed to repatriate Japanese overseas residents in the Communist army area. From the Songhua River in the north to Lafa in the south, tens of thousands of Japanese were sent to Huludao in an endless stream. Saga, who had changed her name to Hamaguchi, disguised herself as a peasant woman, wearing old Japanese military uniforms, black glasses, and an old straw hat used by Japanese farmers, covering her forehead. On September 5, she mingled with a large group of Japanese overseas residents, left Harbin, crossed the Songhua River, was inspected by the Kuomintang army, and boarded a train to repatriate Japanese overseas residents back to their country, passing through Changchun and Shenyang. On September 10, she arrived in Jinzhou and was accommodated in the Xinmin District concentration camp, waiting for vaccinations.</p>
<p>It was not easy to arrest a Japanese woman among the tens of thousands of Japanese overseas residents being repatriated every day. Saga Hiro's name was not on the repatriation roster. Even if they compared each photo with the past, no one would have thought that the pitiful middle-aged peasant woman was the female protagonist who had once been responsible for great political conspiracies. Finally, she was found among the 50,000 to 60,000 Japanese overseas residents in the Jinzhou concentration camp. It turned out that her foolish maid, Kumamoto Masakimi, could not change her name or disguise herself. Finding the maid naturally meant finding her. Although the Japanese tried every means to protect her, on September 16, she finally arrived in Huludao with her daughter Huisheng.</p>
<p>Short in stature, 34 years old, with a slight hunchback, a pair of large eyes filled with melancholy, and often a nervous laugh. She could speak a not-very-accurate Beijing dialect. She said how pitiful Puyi was, and she also guessed that her husband Pujie was already dead. One daughter was in Tokyo, and one daughter was by her side. Perhaps the Japanese political schemers no longer wanted to use her? Her dream of becoming a future "Empress Dowager" was shattered. Moreover, marrying Pujie meant she was only a concubine (Pujie's former wife was Pu Shi Tang Jiao. After the September 18 Incident, she eloped with a large amount of wealth and broke off relations with Pujie.)</p>
<h3>The Puppet Manchu Imperial Family Tenaciously Clung to Puyi</h3>
<p>The puppet emperor's full name should be Aisin Gioro Puyi. According to the meaning of the Manchu language, Aisin is gold, Gioro is the surname, and Puyi is the name, so "Gold Surname Puyi" is a more appropriate way to call the puppet Jin Puyi. He was the eldest son of Zai Feng, the second younger brother of Guangxu. In addition, there was Pujie, who was one year younger than him. It can be said that he had a group of siblings. Starting from the second princess (meaning the second daughter), there were six "imperial sisters." The second princess was married to Xiang Duigu, the grandson of Zheng Xiaoxu, a marriage that broke the rules because Zheng was from Fujian and was definitely not a Qiren (Bannerman). Because of the "imperial grace," Zheng worked in the puppet Manchu Foreign Ministry. The husband of the "third imperial sister," the third princess, was Runlin, the younger brother of the puppet empress Qiu Hong, who had hereditary mental illness. The "imperial son-in-law" of the "fourth imperial sister" was Zhao Guoqi. Like Runlin, after training at a Japanese military academy, he served as a military officer in the "Imperial Guard" protecting the "imperial family." The fifth princess married the Qiren Wan Xixi, who also never left Puyi's side and was responsible for protecting the puppet emperor. When victory came, Puyi fled to Tonghua, and they "attended by his side."</p>
<p>Forgotten and neglected by Puyi were his half-siblings born to his stepmother: Puyi Ren, who is now 29 years old, and the married sixth princess, and the seventh princess waiting to be married at the "Prince Chun's Mansion." They did not go to the Northeast to be ennobled and had been living a life of seclusion in Beiping.</p>
<h3>"Puppet Manchu Empress" Qiu Hong: The Before and After of Her Death in Prison</h3>
<p>"It is reported that Puyi's first wife died in late August in Dunhua, Jilin. Note: Qiu Hong fled to Tonghua with Puyi before Japan's surrender. Later, after Puyi was taken to the Soviet Union, she was captured by the Communist army. When the Communist army entered Changchun, they also brought her to Changchun, then moved her to Yongji, and then escorted her to Yanji, where she was imprisoned. Qiu Hong was originally in poor health. Coupled with the dispersal of her attendants, she died of illness." (Northeast Press, Changchun News)</p>
<p>Qiu Hong is dead. After reading the above news, one can imagine how miserably Puyi's first wife, who had been called "empress" three times, died. She was the daughter of Rongyuan, the former Qing Zhili Northern Circuit Intendant, one year younger than Puyi, and would have been 40 years old this year. In 1922, when Puyi was 17 years old, the Forbidden City in Beiping held its last lively event. Under the guidance of his English teacher Reginald Johnston, Puyi wanted to Westernize everywhere, cutting off the long braid that symbolized the Qing Dynasty and specially taking an English name called "Henry," expressing his admiration for the English King Henry VIII. Therefore, his "empress" had to be given a Western name, called "Elizabeth." The rules of the court were one empress and one consort. At the same time as Qiu Hong, the Noble Consort Shou was married. She was a Qiren from the Erdet family. In November 1924, Puyi was expelled from the Forbidden City and moved to his father's Prince Chun's Mansion by Shicha Lake. Qiu Hong was always by his side. Then, after Puyi was escorted to Tianjin by Japanese Minister Yoshizawa and lived in seclusion on Miyajima Street in the Japanese concession, Qiu Hong became addicted to opium due to illness and also discovered hereditary mental illness. She and Puyi were only nominally "emperor and empress." In October 1932, after Puyi was sent to Lushun by the Japanese ship Bijisan Maru, Kawashima Yoshiko, the daughter of Prince Su, first persuaded Qiu Hong to accept the glory of being the puppet Manchu empress. On March 1, 1934, Puyi ascended the throne as a puppet emperor in Changchun. As Puyi's first wife, Qiu Hong was also qualified to become the empress. However, Puyi did not like her. She had an unusual mental illness and was also a heavily addicted opium smoker. Puyi preferred a Manchu consort named "Tatara." According to a United Press report from Tokyo on August 19 by Central News Agency: "Puyi pounded the witness table and shouted loudly: 'My wife was poisoned to death by the Japanese. I know who did it, it was Lieutenant General Yoshioka.'" The reason for Puyi's outrage at the Tokyo Far East International Military Tribunal was the death of his beloved Tatara consort. The ridiculous Japanese warlords felt that Puyi did not accept marrying a Japanese wife, so they poisoned his Tatara consort. At the same time, they felt that it was necessary to maintain a one-empress, one-consort system. Lieutenant General Yoshioka selected the daughter of a pancake shop in Changchun as Puyi's "new consort."</p>
<p>Victory shattered the dream of the puppet Manchu imperial family. More than 200 fleeing "imperial relatives" arrived in Tonghua. Puyi and his male "imperial relatives" were taken to the Soviet Union. The future "Empress Dowager" Saga Hiro was brought to Shanghai. The puppet empress Qiu Hong was imprisoned in an iron cage in Dunhua and died of illness after being paraded. Only the "new consort" Li returned to Changchun and lived in her family's pancake shop.</p>

<h3>Let's Talk About Romance!</h3>
<p>— Bao Wu</p>
<p>The sky is high and the air is crisp. Wouldn't it be nice to talk about romance!</p>
<p>Fat, thin, rustic, pretty—look, there are so many empresses! People's enthusiasm is so high! This is not a Hollywood movie scene; these are real people and events. Originally, after the end of the war, some people were busy with construction, and some people were busy with revitalizing industry. Naturally, some people would inevitably be busy electing empresses!</p>
<p>What are we busy with?</p>
<p>At least, we have been somewhat busy when queuing to buy movie tickets.</p>
<p>What a glorious sight! Let everyone shout long live romance.</p>
<p>However, let's get back to the point. Electing empresses and the like may not be entirely without reason. For example, fitness can certainly be promoted; and the idea that female bodies must be treated as taboo has no reason to continue to exist today.</p>
<p>In summary, I talked about romance as above.</p>

<h3>Talking About Small Actions</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>People's small actions are sometimes more worthy of attention than strange behaviors. Because from these small actions, we can glimpse people's inner intentions, so as not to be obscured by the release of smokescreens or the performances of disguises.</p>
<p>I read in the "Bin Tui Lu" the story of Wang Gen and others discussing dying for their principles:</p>
<p>"Wang Gen, Hu Guang, and Li Guan were all Jinshi in the second year of Jianwen and were awarded the title of compiler. Initially, Wang Gen was first, but because of his appearance, he was replaced by Hu Jing, who was Hu Guang. Wang Gen was second, and Guan was next. When Emperor Wen's army entered Jinchuan Gate, Xie Xu, Wu Pu, and Gen Jing lived together in the same house and all went to Pu's house to swear to die. Jin and Jing were both generous and clear about their intentions, but Gen cried silently, and Pu suddenly laughed. The three left. Pu's son, Xingbi, who was Kangzhai Xiansheng, was still young at the time and whispered: 'It would be a great thing if Uncle Hu could die!' Bo said: 'No, Uncle Wang will die!' Before he finished speaking, Jing was heard calling his servant through the wall: 'The outside is in chaos, be careful of the pigs, don't let them escape!' Pu looked at him and said: 'You can't bear to lose a pig, let alone your life!' A moment later, Gen was heard crying and drinking poison to death, while Jin and Jing both rushed to greet the emperor's horse."</p>
<p>I also read the story of Hong Chengchou's unfulfilled death for his principles in the "Xiao Ting Za Lu":</p>
<p>"When Emperor Wen recovered Hong Wenxiang, it was said that Fan Jianfeng, the magistrate of Fan, said that when Hong was captured, Emperor Wen ordered the late Wen Su Gong to persuade him. Hong scolded him endlessly, and Wen Su pacified him with good words. He then talked with him about ancient and modern events. At that time, there was dust accumulated in the beams falling on Hong's sleeves, and Hong repeatedly brushed it off. Wen Su hurriedly resigned and reported to Emperor Wen: 'Chengchou will not die! He still cherishes his worn clothes so much, let alone his body?' Later, Wen Nang indeed surrendered, as Gong had expected."</p>
<p>Calling the servant "be careful of the pigs, don't let them escape," and "repeatedly brushing off" the dust accumulated in the beams falling on his sleeves, these are all small actions. But discerning people can glimpse the other party's inner intentions from this. Sure enough, neither Hu Guang nor Hong Chengchou were able to die for their principles. Because Hu Guang's "generous and clear about their intentions" and Hong Chengchou's "scolding him endlessly" were just the release of smokescreens, or it could be said to be a performance of disguise. But even while they are performing, who is not a hero!</p>
<p>We have all seen plays. When performing a tragedy, the audience must be moved by the performance's realism to shed tears of sympathy. If there are some oversights in the actions, I am afraid that not only will they not earn people's tears, but they will also provoke people's contempt. Because from those negligent actions, it has already been clearly told that this is fake. The so-called "playing a fake role for real" means that even small actions cannot be overlooked. But it is difficult to say. To avoid neglecting even small actions, the inner intentions must be in sync with the actions. Otherwise, in some small actions, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be a discrepancy between body and mind. In this way, cold-eyed observers can glimpse their inner intentions and discover their true form, without having to wait until after the makeup is removed.</p>
<h3>The Life and Works of Literary Artists</h3>
<p>— Hua Lin</p>
<p>Literary artists are different from entrepreneurs. One is the real world, and the other is the imaginary world. The works of literary artists are their lives, and the lives of entrepreneurs are their works. There are also literary artists who have the genius of entrepreneurs, and there are also entrepreneurs who have rich imagination and creativity, such as Alexander and Napoleon, who are both entrepreneurs and have artistic genius, such as Da Vinci and Goethe, who are both literary artists and have the ability to manufacture industry and manage government affairs!</p>
<p>The life and works of literary artists vary depending on each individual's genius. In terms of pure literature, the poorer and more painful the life of a literary artist, the richer and more outstanding their works often are! Some people say that "genius is madness." In fact, whether genius is madness cannot be based on his life, but only on whether the content of his works is harmonious and consistent. It should be known that the lives of literary artists are not necessarily harmonious with real life. To truly understand literary artists, one must understand them from their works. Life is often in contradiction and conflict. Aristotle said: "Great people are mostly in pain." Longbuso said: "Genius is mentally ill." Voltaire liked to drink coffee, Lyser liked to drink wine, and Maupassant liked to drink anesthetics. Chinese literati are also mostly like this. Literary artists often have quirks, so their lives are often extremely unharmonious and in conflict with reality! There is also a Chinese saying that poetry becomes more accomplished through poverty, just like the Dutch painting saint Rembrandt in his later years, who was poor and destitute, but his works became more brilliant! After Beethoven went deaf, he was able to compose the Ninth Symphony in his painful struggle. The Russian writer Dostoevsky experienced all the sufferings of the world and had "Crime and Punishment" published. It can be seen that "pain is sacred." For literary artists, pain can be said to be a place that Heaven uniquely bestows. Therefore, their lives may not be normal, and they may have many pathologies. But their lives are completely placed in their works. Only their works can recognize their true selves and recognize their genius. If we talk about the lives of literary artists, not everyone is necessarily harmonious and consistent with their works. Because of the conflict between ideal and reality, their lives are also much more complex and difficult.</p>
<p>Throughout history, many patriotic poets could not die in their hometowns, many writers who saved the world and pitied people could not be understood by their contemporaries, many geniuses and masterpieces were buried in the chaos of war, and many generous and tragic figures were victimized by a ruthless and cold society! The so-called creator is jealous of talent, and the tree that stands out in the forest will be destroyed by the wind, and the crane that stands out among the chickens will be insulted by the crowd. Literary artists living in this kind of society, people with wisdom and passion, will not be approved by the world. In other words, as I said before, "pain is precisely the place that Heaven uniquely bestows on literary writers." A true literary artist who does not have many scars on his red heart is very mediocre.</p>
<p>Pain not only purifies life, but also creates life, making his works richer and more sublime. Ordinary people are destroyed by the grinding of pain, while literary artists regard it as a rose crown of great reputation, with many thorns on it. The flower is dyed with blood, and only genius is happy to accept this special honor!</p>
<h3>Traces of Autumn Clouds</h3>
<p>— Jiang Dachen</p>
<p>Is there any scene in the world more fleeting and uncertain than autumn clouds? They are bright and transparent, light as silk, and roll and disappear freely and suddenly. People can sit in front of a window, or lie on the grass, savoring the philosophy of white clouds and gray dogs, chanting: "Autumn clouds go without a trace, where is the previous period? Playful desires are unfamiliar, wine companions are desolate, not like when I was young!" (Liu Yong: Boyhood Travels)</p>
<p>Autumn is truly a season of reverie. It is sparse and delicate, bright and unadorned. It lures people to sink into the net of memories. It makes people rub their own joys, sorrows, warmth, coldness, sweetness, bitterness, and辛酸 in the burst of mixed feelings of regret and knowing smiles. Autumn is not like spring, which is full of vitality, with peach blossoms and green willows everywhere, and the sound of birds and the fragrance of flowers, full of hope for the future. It is not as magnificent as summer, with endless heat and brilliance like a tapestry painting. Autumn is the low point of vitality, the melancholy after the high-pitched melody; it is a good time for distant mountains like黛, tall wutong trees sparse, rain hitting plantain leaves, and the sound of crickets and birds on the horizon. If winter is an old man in his twilight years, with stiff hands and feet and approaching stagnation, then autumn is the charm of a young woman, the vastness of a strong heart, familiar with the divergence of the world's paths but unable to shake off the memories of past luxury; although the illusions are just beginning to wake up, it is really a bit at a loss.</p>
<p>People can think about how those friends of the idealists in "沙宁" (novel title) were surging and forging in the eight years of war. Some can naturally still stubbornly infiltrate people's hearts like high mountains and flowing water, but most of them have to be like a flash of lightning before a summer thunderstorm, no, it is better to say that they are like disappearing autumn clouds, although they are radiant, or brilliant as brocade, but ultimately they are like the illusion of a bubble.</p>
<p>Beside a city with pagoda shadows and mountain lights, he said goodbye to his close friend, entrusting thousands of trivialities; proceeding in a desolate village, in a pitch-black night. However, the lover of great ideals can only regard life as a poem, a passionate poem. He wants to live decently and die happily. He does not want to be cut with a dull knife, he despises that kind of humble and cautious hypocrite. Finally, in a season of disappearing autumn clouds, his close friend disappeared like autumn clouds.</p>
<p>People can also think about what it was like to be a wandering traveler in a mountain city bombed like rotten tofu, suffering from lonely homesickness, facing the illusion of autumn clouds, counting the wanderings of their own footsteps, and not remembering what true feelings they had spoken to those confidants that seemed true and false. Had they fallen into the pursuit of fame and fortune? Had they resigned themselves to following the crowd? This is the only quality worth upholding, and other than this, is there only emptiness left?</p>
<p>People can even more think about being trapped in a cage, facing that small window, envying the agility and vividness of autumn clouds, while they themselves tasted the cruelty that should not exist in the world on a night before and after the Double Ninth Festival, struggling with a dying breath under the iron boots, Japanese swords, wooden sticks, and cold water of their children.</p>
<p>Oh, you fleeting, uncertain, and suddenly changing autumn clouds! You are the symbol of life, the mystery of the universe. You seem to be laughing at our foolishness, or you seem to be pitying our infatuation. Our hearts are dazed, our nightmares are heavy, facing a vast fire, and unable to extinguish it with a wise heart. I say: what we lack: is precisely the freedom to stretch out like you, without being bound.</p>
<p>Oh, you fleeting, uncertain, and suddenly changing autumn clouds! Where shall I go to seek the traces of your past travels? I know that countless memories linger on your beautiful feathers.</p>
<p>Autumn clouds, autumn clouds, you give people warm comfort, you give people a cool breeze, you are the light of life, you are the soul of the universe.</p>
<h3>Mother and Child (Sculpture)</h3>
<p>— Royer Bloche</p>
<h3>A Lament for the Panda</h3>
<p>— Lan Ning</p>
<p>Nine months ago, you came into this world. Three months ago, you came into contact with human civilization. Just four days ago, you arrived in Shanghai, a so-called international city, but you couldn't endure it any longer and returned to your heavenly home, where you should have lived.</p>
<p>In the evening, seeing the news of your death, I was speechless, utterly speechless—</p>
<p>But the thoughts in my mind could not be controlled, rising and falling incessantly:</p>
<p>Miss, how fortunate were you to be born a rare species in the world! The moment you were born, your species determined your preciousness. Countless people were stirred by you, captivated by you. To capture you, three hunters were mistaken for besiegers by bandits, shot, and killed. University professors and experts ventured deep into barren lands for you, enduring hardship. News reporters tirelessly pursued your whereabouts, reporting on your daily life. Newspapers daily published special features and beautiful photographs of you. When you came, you traveled by plane, almost across most of China, accompanied by two American military officers. The travel expenses alone amounted to more than 690,000 yuan, and along the way, you were supplied with delicacies from your hometown.</p>
<p>However, how unfortunate were you that between you and the many people who loved and fawned over you, there was always this wooden cage, this iron chain. Did they really love you? Did they really care for you so much, fearing that you might be cold, hungry, or starving?</p>
<p>I have never been to the continuous, towering mountains of Wenchuan, but I can imagine you strolling with your mother along the streamside, peeling and eating the delicious, tender bamboo shoots when hungry, and drinking the clear spring water under the waterfall when thirsty. Peaceful, leisurely, it was such a harmonious life. But unfortunately, there are humans in the world. Even more unfortunately, humans love you, love you madly. Even to the point of killing your poor mother, in order to bring you to this so-called civilized world.</p>
<p>Clearly, from the day you left your hometown, you were listless and unhappy. You ate less and slept less. Were you missing your hometown? I imagine. —Were you missing your mother?</p>
<p>Moreover, upon arriving in this civilized world, you were housed on the top floor of a slaughterhouse. In the quiet of the night, the lights flickered. Alone in this wooden cage exposed to the cold wind, you heard the tragic cries of cattle and sheep before their execution below, you saw the patches of fresh red blood... Even humans have feelings, and you are a fellow creature with four legs, how could you not be affected!</p>
<p>Although cattle and sheep are subject to human slaughter, and you are subject to human adoration, your fates are ultimately the same!</p>
<p>Now, you have finally gone, and that's good too—a broken flower branch will wither sooner or later anyway. —May you return to your mother, may you rest in peace, may God bless your journey.</p>

<p>How many times the wind and rain,</p>
<p>Have blown down leaf after leaf of yellow...</p>
<p>The first sigh,</p>
<p>Like the vast west wind,</p>
<p>Towards the distant</p>
<p>Cloudy sky...</p>
<p>Only remains,</p>
<p>A lonely heart,</p>
<p>Still like a bright red maple leaf,</p>
<p>Swaying in the wind and rain!</p>

<p>Don't ask me where I come from,</p>
<p>Or where I am going,</p>
<p>Look at my body covered in mottled mud,</p>
<p>And you will know that I am a traveler in the wind and rain.</p>
<p>The cold raindrops,</p>
<p>From my disheveled hair,</p>
<p>Flow over my burning chest,</p>
<p>Mixed with sweat, mixed with tears,</p>
<p>Nourishing the suffering land of my motherland that I have walked through!</p>
<p>I don't want to grab an umbrella,</p>
<p>Or borrow a nice raincoat,</p>
<p>I just want to leave my hard-working footprints,</p>
<p>On this muddy road!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 67</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>The small chief was embarrassed. I thought this chief was not a bad person, so I asked him to explain what was going on. He hesitated for a long time before sighing, "To tell you two, we're just trying to make a living here, who wants to do this, it's really not human... You know there are spies on the train who take orders from others, if they don't report anything for a day, they lose two yuan and five. That's the truth. ...The three brothers were originally guards on the train, you saw it clearly. Those who make a living as spies all have powerful backers, if they are told to move, they can't just sit still, they have to move. ...”</p>
<p>"So, what's going on with getting off the train?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"The spy first wanted to cover up the train's reputation, and second, he wanted to find out what kind of people you are, maybe he even wanted to search your luggage, otherwise, he wouldn't have any material to report."</p>
<p>"So, why didn't he do it?"</p>
<p>"This," the small chief looked at Tiger Brother, "He saw that this little... little... little..." He couldn't say "little" anymore, calling him "little brother" he didn't dare, "little young master?" it wasn't appropriate, "little old master?" he couldn't say it either, "little ancestor," he was willing, but he was afraid he wouldn't accept it, he stammered for a moment, then suddenly his face lit up, "This 'little master,' 'yes!'" He finally got such an address, and couldn't help but praise himself with a "yes!" before continuing, "Seeing his high skills, fierce work, he must have come from somewhere. Don't look down on him for making a living as a spy, what does he rely on? It's still a few Jianghu secrets, a pair of eyes that see things clearly. ..." As he spoke, he swallowed another mouthful of saliva.</p>
<p>"Keep talking!" Tiger Brother was probably hungry again, his liver fire was very high.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes..." The chief seemed to want to bow, "He understood himself, so he threw the blame on the three guards, and each of them ran away."</p>
<p>"He probably has companions on the train, it can't be just him alone. So, why didn't he call a few more?"</p>
<p>"That's impossible... First, whoever starts the matter, gets the job, and earns two yuan and five. Secondly, since he saw that it was not easy to provoke, the other partners also have eyes, who would be willing to bump their heads against a nail?"</p>
<p>I saw that he was finished talking, and I didn't want to ask any further, so I asked him for a car. He put on that toothache-like smile again, saying that as long as we were willing to wait, he could rush to Shuangqiao Town to make a phone call and call a car from the city, maybe after waiting for more than an hour. As he spoke, he put away his smile and showed that cold look again.</p>
<p>"Shall we go for a stroll in Shuangqiao?" We left the police station, and Tiger Brother, carrying the bag, asked me as we walked.</p>
<p>I knew he wanted to eat something, so I thought for a moment and said, "If it's on the way, we might as well stroll around, otherwise, let's just walk along the highway, buy whatever we see to eat, okay?"</p>
<p>Tiger Brother raised his hand towards the east, winked, "Okay. There's a fork in the road ahead, and there are also a few houses, there must be food to sell."</p>
<p>After walking for more than a mile, we arrived at the fork in the road, and sure enough, there was a food shop, but those steamed buns looked very dirty, covered in flies. Tiger Brother rushed forward to ask the waiter inside if there were any seats. The waiter shook his head and stared at us attentively. Just then, the curtain in the inner room opened, and a middle-aged woman came out, with fair skin and a white complexion, but dressed like a villager, and very gentle. She looked at us, then walked up to us:</p>

<h3>Men and Women</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>A friend who swore never to marry, recently invited me to his wedding. Some people are speculating about the bride's magic, others say it's because he's reached that age. I am not a superstitious fatalist, but I quite believe in nature, between men and women, it is often impossible to jump out of the circle of their surrounding environment.</p>
<p>I remember these two famous sayings:</p>
<p>"A man without a woman is like walking in the dark."</p>
<p>"A woman without a man withers."</p>
<p>Who wants to walk in the dark for a lifetime? Who wants to wither for a lifetime? Here's a joke, a man said I embrace bachelorhood; a woman said I will never marry; someone interrupted and said: You two are like-minded, you can grow old together. Both men and women expressed their agreement, and asked this third party to be their wedding witness.</p>
<p>The word nature I mentioned earlier, if visualized, can also be called the Old Man Under the Moon. If you don't believe me, you can take any newly married couple as an example and study their various environmental relationships, and it will not be difficult to find clues. As for so-called unexpected good news, it is almost a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>Humans, although called the spirit of all things, are actually muddleheaded, and heaven and earth are ultimately limited, which is sad. Several single friends seem to be rebelling, regardless of success or failure, their fates are quite the same.</p>
<h3>Paris Bans Prostitution The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women Declares War on Prostitution</h3>
<p>— Chai Fei</p>
<p>Paris is banning prostitution. Gaston, secretary-general of the French Prostitutes' Association, shrugged his shoulders and said, "The new ban is like the American one, well-intentioned, but ineffective. Prostitution is like wine, it can never be banned by a piece of paper. Girls become prostitutes voluntarily. In Paris, they earn more in one night than female shop assistants and maids earn in a month." His only responsibility is to collect taxes from prostitutes and submit them to the government. According to him, seven out of ten francs earned by a prostitute belong to the government. What kind of business can the government levy such a heavy tax on?</p>
<p>His arch-rival, Madame Richard, claims that the generous profits from prostitution are extracted by brothel owners. She refutes Gaston's claim that prostitution is voluntary, "The truth is this," she said, "Brothel owners employ many villains who entice women into prostitution. They use huge bribes to buy off doctors and scientists to publicize that prostitution is harmless to general social life if it can be controlled." She knows a brothel owner who lives in a country villa and never goes to the brothel that is his cash cow. Many other people who hold brothel stocks never set foot in the brothel, but on Sundays, they always go to church as usual to attend mass. She said, "Although the ban on prostitution has been enacted by law, brothel owners will still show their magic powers and continue their mysterious business."</p>
<p>Inside a Paris Brothel Paris brothels are generally divided into three classes. Those on the banks of the Saint-Martin Canal belong to the third class. Upon entering, it is like entering a maze. Once you get used to the smoke, you can see several women sitting and smoking, and men drinking. The customers are mostly black people and Arabs. The madam greets guests very kindly. She leads you to see the bar, the dining room, and the examination room. It is said that prostitutes are examined in the room once a week. She says, "This is really like a women's college. Our girls are forbidden to drink, and their lives are very disciplined." The overnight fee for this type of brothel is six dimes per night.</p>
<p>The customers of mid-range brothels are mostly civil servants and peddlers. The facilities are quite beautiful. If customers are willing, they can check the prostitute's body through a glass door. When checking, customers can see the prostitute, but the prostitute cannot see the customer. The room rent is five dimes per night, and the overnight fee is two dollars and fifty cents.</p>
<p>The luxury of high-end brothels is second to none in the world. For a visitor who has no actual interest in the brothel, the madam's attitude is very arrogant. Many rooms are closed to you. The bar is very luxurious, with carpets, a piano, and a music stage large enough to accommodate an orchestra. In addition, there are elevators and telephone switchboards.</p>
<p>Each room on the second floor is decorated with various bewitching pictures, exposing an orderly set of sins at a glance. One room is decorated like a fine sedan, with windows in the walls, landscape paintings hanging next to the windows, and the room rattling, giving people the sudden feeling of being on a journey. Some rooms have domes built of ice and snow like those of the Eskimos, some are like hunter's tents, and some are like seaside halls.</p>
<p>Here, the room rent is two US dollars per night, and the overnight fee is one hundred US dollars.</p>
<p>Pitiable Ill-Fated Beauties But no matter how enchanting and charming a prostitute is, her income is always pitiful. They are simply slaves of the brothel owners, and brothels are just human flesh markets!</p>
<p>Fortunately, the United Nations has a Commission on the Status of Women, which, under the leadership of Mrs. Roosevelt, is preparing to declare war on prostitution. One of her many tasks is to help women no longer make a living as prostitutes. Those who have already engaged in prostitution should use the education system to break free from the shackles of impurity and engage in legitimate occupations.</p>
<p>Although Paris has now explicitly banned prostitution, the danger lies in the future prevalence of private prostitution, and organizations such as the Prostitutes' Association will also come back to life. In this situation, someone asked Gaston how he would exercise his powers, and he could only smile and not answer.</p>
<h3>Jiang Taigong Is Not Here</h3>
<p>— W·W</p>
<p>The execution of Jiang Gongmei, the corrupt official who robbed and embezzled, is truly a catastrophe for the corruption world! The original sentence was only imprisonment, but because Jiang Gongmei was not beautiful, public opinion demanded punishment, all saying he should be killed, and he ended up in such a fate. Young as he was, he dared to commit such a great transgression. Even if Jiang Taigong were here, he could not be reckless in everything. Those fools who have been following his example or are eager to try, can they still dare? Killing one to warn a hundred, we praise the authorities' decisiveness; further, we hope to kill a hundred to warn ten thousand, what harm would that do?</p>
<h3>I Am a "Marker"</h3>
<p>— Zhi Hong</p>
<p>I have been a "marker" in the biggest billiard room in the city for more than a year.</p>
<p>I believe that few people care about or know about our lives. Because we are the Boy of upper-class gentlemen! We have to do fourteen hours of work for those wealthy customers every day, from nine in the morning to eleven at night.</p>
<p>Full, full, when others are on vacation, at their happiest time, we are the busiest and least happy. All day long, we hold a stick with a copper frame on the end—a "rest," used when the guest's hand is not long enough. Focused, enduring fatigue. Is the guest hitting red? White? Red goes into the pocket, white goes into the pocket. So we add the scores, three points, five points, seven points, ... The guest is playing a thirty-yuan or fifty-yuan game! We can't add a single point wrong, or we'll get slapped. Occasionally a billiard ball falls into the pocket without being seen, and the guest shouts loudly, "Marker! Pick up the ball!" Scaring you out of your wits.</p>
<p>Others have shifts, but we don't. When it's busy, everyone goes hungry. If you're lucky, the guest doesn't continue playing, and you rush to open the lunch box sent from home, already ice-cold.</p>
<p>If the billiard table opens up while you're eating, you have to put away your eating and add the scores, half-full and half-hungry.</p>
<p>The monthly salary is six thousand yuan, and we remit small accounts of ten thousand. We have never complained that it is too little. Because everyone is a child. Although whenever we take it home, the adults always say, "Tsk, you can't see the sun every day, and you only get six thousand yuan a month."</p>
<p>Yes, the boss only gives us six thousand yuan, we just take our strength and spirit and turn them into small accounts. We also have to be careful of unexpected disasters. One child dropped a billiard ball and had to pay several yuan and was also scolded. Once, a colleague accidentally broke a piece of glass while arranging the cloth, and had to pay for a month of small accounts. He cried until his eyes were red and swollen, so pitiful.</p>
<h3>New Tang Poetry</h3>
<p>— Li Xun</p>
<p>Autumn sleep, unaware of dawn, everywhere I hear "theft," a sound of "corruption," how many "cases" have been "solved"?</p>
<p>The two-pronged material case, the grain loan case, have not yet been "solved," and small things like "wharf theft," and big things like "embezzlement by those in charge," are becoming more and more rampant, it can be said that there is no day without them, in the tune of "Spring Dawn," but also "whining without illness."</p>
<h3>A Fine Tale from the Military</h3>
<p>— Holy</p>
<p>The 18th anniversary of the Army Military Academy, the principal presided over the ceremony in person, and the guards were students. In the evening, the principal issued a handwritten order: "After 9:00 PM, no officers or soldiers are allowed to enter the school, and they must be locked up in the detention room." Coincidentally, the director of education returned to school at 11:00 PM. The guards stopped the car and did not allow it to enter, because it was an order from the principal. The director of education could not enter. Later, he had to make a phone call elsewhere to report to the principal, and then the principal sent a telegram to the guard commander before he was allowed to pass. This kind of earnest law-abiding is truly worthy of special mention.</p>
<p>According to a National Army comrade who returned from the Northeast, on the front lines in the Northeast, sometimes the National and Communist armies were very close. During ceasefires, National Army soldiers would wave to Communist Army soldiers and say in Sichuan dialect, "Come over here!" Communist Army soldiers would answer in a low voice, "There are guns pointed at our asses behind us!"</p>
<p>During the Battle of Benxi River in the Northeast, Lin Biao (first class of Whampoa) sent a letter to Zhao Gongwu, the commander of the 53rd Army (third class of Whampoa), roughly saying: "Brother Gongwu, if your army cannot capture the Benxi River, then your elder brother and your little brothers will have no foothold in the Northeast; conversely, if you capture it within three days, I will lead all the Communist forces in the Northeast to surrender." Commander Zhao forwarded this letter to Commander Du, who immediately ordered the New Sixth Army to take action. As a result, in less than two days, the Benxi River was captured by the National Army. Commander Du then telegraphed Lin Biao to ask if his promise could be fulfilled. Lin replied in a telegram: "I was just joking with you, why take it so seriously!" Unexpectedly, Lin Biao's bragging was exposed!</p>
<h3>This giraffe in a circus is sticking out her long tongue and joking with the female actress in the circus.</h3>
<h3>Weekend Chat</h3>
<p>— S·S</p>
<p>"Cultural Exchange"</p>
<p>While the Ministry of Education is considering raising the level of English in universities, it is said that Hong Kong's education will also be reformed, the method is to convert all English schools into primary schools, and use Chinese and English equally in junior high schools; after one year of high school, Chinese and English will be divided into departments, if after graduating from the Chinese department in high school, you can transfer to universities in China, the English department has not been mentioned, probably most of them will be sent to London for "further study." This method was decided after the Hong Kong government and the Ministry of Education "established contact." The purpose is of course to "increase the close connection between Chinese and English culture." In fact? Our generation's English level can already be considered high enough, don't you see that the daughters of the dignified Director ××× are called "Catherine" and "Louise"? Now that the education authorities are planning to raise it again, probably our next generation will have no time to learn the countless Chinese characters in the "Thousand Character Classic" and "Hundred Family Surnames." Although the Hong Kong government knows that it is a small area, it does not want to lag behind others in "increasing cultural connections," fearing that Chinese people's English level will be too good and forget their own Chinese, so it particularly emphasizes Chinese teaching, and then sends them to China to "study" English, this shows international friendship, really great.</p>
<p>Crowd Psychology</p>
<p>Chinese people who read "Water Margin" will probably have two kinds of psychological reactions after reading it: one is that in a peaceful era, the reader's social environment is national security, people are prosperous, and each person's economic life does not feel a serious threat, even if some people like Cai Jing and Gao Qiu appear at that time, domineering and selfish, manipulating power and stealing power, messing around in the government, everyone can more or less silently forgive them, and think that the actions of the Liangshan rebels who rob homes and kill people are superfluous, and even annoying. The other is that in a chaotic era, the reader's social environment is political derailment, greed and corruption are rampant, especially when they feel in life that "why take everything as much as possible, and use it like mud and sand," they feel that those "Black Whirlwind" and "Leopard Head" figures are kind and lovable; at the moment when some corrupt officials and bureaucrats unscrupulously reach out to them, they can't wait to pounce on them like Li Kui and "bite off your flesh," but? The impossible result in fact increases their longing for the Hall of Loyalty and Righteousness. When "Desert Serenade" was screened, the scene where Dennis Morgan led hundreds of warriors on horseback down the mountain, robbing and killing the Burger and capturing Dabucha, the audience cheered for the bandits for completing the task of eliminating violence and bringing peace, isn't this a bright and shining mirror of the most realistic administration?</p>
<p>The Same Throughout History</p>
<p>Recently, rereading Romance of the Three Kingdoms, I found that Zhuge Liang has many small gimmicks, and the skills of coping with the world today, two or three thousand years later, are actually not without similarities. For example, in the Battle of Xinye, where Liu Bei was defeated, he relied on a mouth that could turn clouds and rain, inciting Sun Cao to fight each other, occupying Jingzhou without bloodshed, and as a result, he angered Zhou Yu to death; he even went to Caisang Port in a light carriage, prostrated himself on the ground, crying to death; those Jiangdong yokels, the idiots who were originally prepared to avenge their master, were also moved to put their swords back into their sheaths, and sighed: "Kong Ming is affectionate, Gong Jin is too short-tempered." Who knew that a sentence would become the "Treasure Mirror for Serving the World" for those adults and gentlemen who regard themselves as "noble and upright" and desperately want to "perfect the ancients and moderns." Usually, when they encounter two friends in difficult circumstances who come to them for help, even if they have a good relationship with the family, they often move enough to embarrass them with their status and airs, but once this friend dies in poverty and sorrow, they write elegiac couplets, send wreaths, and cry sadly at the memorial service: "We used to be friends who were like horns, sharing our liver and gallbladder!" People on the sidelines will naturally praise his enthusiasm a few times; so those filial sons and virtuous grandsons who feed their old mothers with coarse food and even abandon the lives of their dear mothers for the sake of their pampered wives, will specially invite celebrities to write "unfilial sins are profound" "showing this behavior," and wait with peace of mind for their parents to cross the crane to the west. Historians have painted a big picture of Zhuge Liang's various deceptions and schemes, so naturally today's society cannot but recognize the continuation of this historical tradition. Amitabha!</p>
