<h3>馬歇爾特使總部宣布　國共協定卽可成立　已指派小組整裝赴長春</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京五日電﹞今日此間晚報曾謂，政府方面對解決東北問題基本態度，約有五點：（一）以實施一月十日之停戰協定爲凖則。（二）整軍方案應切實實施，且在東北首先實施。（三）恢復交通應有具體辦法，切實實施，並須有所保證。（四）加重馬歇爾之仲　裁權（最後決定權）。（五）此次談商後，雙方應切實保證實施，並須於十天內確獲結果，政府絕無非俟哈爾濱收復再事談商之意。晚報另稱：中共對解決東北問題基本態度，亦有下列各點：（一）一月十日停戰協定，固應切實旅行，但三月廿七日之東北停戰協定，亦應切實施行（按此協定內容不明）。（二）整軍方案切實實施後，中共軍隊亦獲得切實保證。（三）恢復交通應全面恢復，包括（甲），鐵路以外之水陸郵電各項交通，（乙），拆除交通綫爾堡，（丙），廢除交通檢查等。（四）一切簽訂之協定，應保證切實實現。京中人士閱後，認爲政府所持態度其聲明（必須於十日內確獲對照）一點，足以充分表示不再因循拖延，重苦民衆，對共黨所持態度，如全面恢復交通各點，僉信此乃政府求之不得者，因凡目前收復區水陸郵電交通之殘破狀態，均爲共黨一手造成，撃鈴解鈴，仍望諸共黨。凖此以觀，共黨對內戰復路二事，尚在故意拖延中，局勢尚待澄清。</p>
<p>﹝合衆社南京五日電﹞今日午後，馬歇爾特使總部宣布：國共協定不久即可成立。並透露謂：該部憶指派前進執行小組整裝赴長春，「凖備實行任何可能獲致之停戰協定」。白魯德准將担任該組之美方高級人員，此點表示，可能在京成立停戰協定之後，在其複雜而微妙之執行工作中，執行總部行將佔有極端重大之職責。</p>
<p>﹝又電﹞今晚周恩來將軍稱：渠希望今晚或明日可將停戰協定簽成。頃自極可靠方面獲悉，停戰期將擴展至十五天，並稱：蔣主席允予七日期之停戰，而共方堅持三十天，經過冗長之折衝談判後，雙方乃互讓至十五天。在此十五日之停戰期內，國共雙方將解消彼此之異見。</p>
<p>﹝聯合社南京五日電﹞軍事三人小組委員會將於明日中午簽訂協定，由馬歇爾，周恩來及徐永昌三委員簽字，簽後立即生效。</p>
<h3>重要問題如獲解決　三人會隨時可開　彭部長答覆外記者詢問</h3>
<p>﹝中央社南京五日電﹞外記者執行會，五日下午四時舉行，由彭部長學沛，劉次長鍩主持，茲錄主要問答如次：</p>
<p>問，現在蔣主席已經回京，三人會議是否可能於數日內重開？</p>
<p>答，（彭部長）重要問題，如目前時局所包含者，通常不能於正式會議中解決，非正式商談，未曾間斷，如能　得解決，三人會議隨時均可開會，四個月前本已成立協議，祇因執行時枝節橫生，以致嚝日廢時，徒增人民痛苦，吾人希望此次之協議，必須附有具體之實施計劃及期限，停止衝突，整編軍隊，恢復交通，不應祇爲原則或口號，尤以恢復交通，最爲迫切，鐵路公路之破壞，致使物資不能流通，難民不能返鄉因此而物價飛漲，社會不安，爲拯救民衆出此水深火熱之苦境，最重要之事項，卽爲恢復交通，政府在東北之軍事，實屬迫不得已，動機不在於攻撃共軍，而在於在中國領土上恢復實權，何況中蘇協定，亦有規定。共黨策略，爲拖延時間，但政府不能任令再在局面無限制拖延下去，因困苦之民衆，渴望迅速之解決也。鑒諸共黨過去之行爲，今後協議，必須具體而附時限，例如恢復交通，必須規定何等路段，即須修復，並規定修復期間，使大家明悉，何日確可通車。吾人確信並強調各協定之迅速實施，並防止對技術或理論問題爭論不已。嚝廢時日，最可靠之辦法，爲加強美方代表仲裁之權力與責任，接受此種仲裁，乃誠意之最好表示與拖延之最好防劑，如共方有更好辦法，政府亦願考慮，倘共黨能同意切實訂立並遵守此種計劃，則主席可發佈命令，停止全國一切之軍事行動。至東蒙自治政府之消息，彭部長稱並不確實。</p>

<h3>調整公務員待遇案　主席核定後施行　國防委會通過中丹條約</h3>

<h3>某權威人士接見記者　論解決大局關鍵　吳鐵城談國民黨渴望和平</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京五日電﹞據某權威人士告本報記者云：今日京滬有少數報紙揭載昨日馬歇爾特使先後與蔣主席，周恩來有關停戰復路之談話經過，並謂蔣主席業面允罵使停止軍事行動七日，以便談判，當經馬使折衷再商，定爲十日。且謂當馬使於昨日下午續與周恩來會談時，周對十日之期尚嫌短促，所談遂未獲結論，如是云云，經上所述，可見中共對停戰一事尚鮮誠意，因今日解決大局　結之處，不在停戰時日之久暫與夫停戰範圍之廣狹，而在中共能否放棄其以暴力奪取政權之顯武觀念，能否自動糾正其陳腐的落伍的反民主的擴張地盤之封建思想，能否放棄利用時機，割據稱雄，規避整軍，保存實力等一切不合時宜之謬見。中共如確信渠等所具備之自卑狂與虐民狂，幾使中華民族陷於萬刦不復之苦境，理宜洗心革面，自動向民衆謝罪，接受馬使之善意，遵守一月十日之停戰協定及整軍方案，尋事停止其在關內外之一切妨害政府接收主權，破路·毀礦·誤國害民之狂妄行動，信守政協決議，提出國大代表及參加政府工作之人員名單，以便尋事改組政府，與國民黨共同負起救國建國之天職，仍有光明之前途，設執迷不悟，縱政府能一忍再忍，曲予寬容，亦恐賊民過甚，衆怒難犯，民衆亦將自動奮起，大張　伐矣。</p>
<p>﹝合衆社南京五日電﹞今日據在和平會談中接近蔣主席之某政府要員聲稱：國共停戰協定，可望於今日或明日簽字，但須視共方對政府所提馬歇爾將軍應在協定之最高仲裁人一項建議是否同意而定。該某官員宣稱：如共方拒絕此項建議，則主席已決定不再談判。渠謂：周恩來將軍強烈反對建議內之主要數點，彼之反對建議內之主要數點，彼之反對，實乃使停戰令遲不發出之惟一原因。</p>
<p>﹝中央社南京五日電﹞吳秘書長鐵城，四日接見合衆社記者，談及民盟代表羅隆基最近發表之意見，吳氏鄭重聲言，國民黨渴望和平，絕不亞於任何派，至羅氏謂美國助長中國之法西斯主義，實屬可笑，此誠侮辱倡導民主之偉大盟邦，羅氏應知美軍在華任務，乃僅爲協助我國接收東北主權及遣送日俘返國，然渠竟發表此種淆亂視聽之意見，殊爲遺憾。吳氏繼稱：我國人士莫不瞭解美國在華使命之崇高及任務之正確，又當長春國軍被圖攻時，並未見羅氏公開勸阻　共軍停攻，乃待國軍逼近四平街，公主內嶺，始倡言停戰，國軍收復長春後，又復欲阻國軍向哈爾濱，齊齊哈爾推進，總之，羅氏之言論，似非出諸中立派人士之口，如以此種態度呼籲和平，恐和平難以實現，無怪外間有人指其爲中共義務發言。吳氏末謂：今後商談之成敗，全視共黨是否在東北停止製撃國軍及是否將放棄協商，而不與國民黨解決問題之拖延策略爲斷。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>勝利後的工程師節</h3>
<p>今天是勝利以後的首次工程師節，也是自有工程師節以來的第六屆工程師節。工程師節乃民國二十九年中國工程師學會在成都舉行年會時所決定的，三十年的六六曾在陪都首次舉行盛大的慶祝。六月六日原爲大禹的誕辰，我們拿紀念這位歷史上刻苦砥礪治水救民的民放救星的日期，作爲工程師節，可見工程師之自勉如何深刻，一般人民對於工程師之斯望又如何殷切。</p>
<p>今天在中國工業都市首屈一指的上海，而又在勝利以後理應加倍致力工業建設的上海，中國工程師學會上海分會來舉行工程師節的紀念，眞當有說不出的興奮。可是迎這抗戰勝利後首屆工程師節的，竟不是新冒烟的烟突，不是偉大工程的興建，而是本市滿街的洋貨，如「玻璃皮夾」，「玻璃絲襪」之類，這對於工程師節是何等的諷剌，何等的痛心！中國自有近代的工程師以來，爲期已不能算是太短，然而面對着工程師的民族經濟危機，其嚴重程度却朱有甚於今日者。此種局勢的造成，原非工程師本身所能負責，但因這種局勢的江河日下，而使工程師未能多所貢獻，我們祇有慚愧，祇有痛恨！</p>
<p>我們對於工程師節？無論慶祝也好，紀念也好，第一要使我們現有的工程師能各在他們本身的崗位上替國家民族多多盡力，多多有工作的機會和塲所。這就是說，我們要儘速先使停工的工廠復工，要儘速實行我們民族的工業計劃，興建工程，廣設工廠。可是在現階段「買辦政策」之下，只知道鼓勵太家競銷洋貨，扼殺國產，不獨已停工廠不能期其復工，即現在冒烟的工廠亦會停爐，至於廣設工廠，興建工程，更將如痴人說夢。面臨着工程師節的來到，我們又得不避厭煩，重新提起應該從速改變目前滿腦子「買辦」思想的經濟政策。</p>
<p>保護我們基礎未固的民族工業，不容再緩了！國民政府早經決定戰後第一期經濟建設的原則，工業的國營與民營，兼籌並顧，集中民間資本與吸收外資，也雙管齊下。但是現在怎樣呢？廉價洋貨的輸入，不特使民族工業的生存感受威脅，且將使我們民族經濟的血液枯竭，將來縱欲投資，亦感無資可投。我們應該趕快制止這種血液外放的逆勢。大家歸咎物價騰貴的原因屬於游資爲祟，然而以中國民間這些微弱的資本，又當工業幾乎毫無基礎之時，竟會市塲上有「游資」，這罪責次不能由握有資本者來負，而應推究爲什麽不讓他們投資於工業的原因，諸如民營工業所遭遇的困難如何？打擊如何？政府予以什麽獎助和鼓勵？必須我們民族工業基礎逐漸穩固，這時我們的工程師纔不患無用武之地。我們重視大規模工業的國營，我們贊成重工業的國營，可是同時我們不能不鼓勵一般輕工業亦即民生日用品工業的民營。</p>
<p>今天我們來慶祝工程師節，允不可忘記那些失業或轉業的工程師。中國的工業化，遲上了人家五十年。我們必須迎頭趕上去。一個工程師的造成，非短期所能立就。今後我們的建國，允需用大批工程人材。蔣主席在其所著的「中國之命運」一書中，經已提及。爲了這個需要，我們固然須要培植新的人材，担負這種新的工作使命，但在過去三十年內，我國所造成的近代工程人材，爲數必相當可觀，而學成以後，每因奔投無路，或工作環境不佳，轉就別業。這在個人是一種浪費，在國家是一種無可補償的損失。而其間抑鬱得志，輾轉於貧病饑餓錢上者，也似乎頗有其人。我們要爲國家愛惜這些人材。吾則一面慶祝工程師節，說些點綴應景的好話，一面却有眞正的工程師冷落得沒有人加以理會，這未免說不過去罷！</p>

<h3>邱吉爾在下院演說稱　世界大戰在醞釀中　痛斥蘇聯散播惡毒宣傳</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦五日廣播。邱吉爾今日在下院發表演說，痛駡蘇聯，並謂：世界大戰已在　　中。邱氏首謂蘇聯與西方民主之關係，已每况愈下，蘇聯之惡互宣傳已予英人以極壞之印象，在過去一年中，蘇聯之間諜及其他種種活動，已引起歐洲三分之一人民的反對。大戰在聲釀中，德國現在兩種不同方式下發展，其一係蘇聯化，其一則遵照西歐民主方式長成。</p>
<p>繼邱氏之後，艾德禮首相亦發表演說，第一句卽述及對蘇關係，在發電時，尙未議舉。</p>
<h3>時乎時乎不再來　蘇若重視和平　四國應締公約　貝文在下院演說全文</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦四日電〕下議院今日對外交政策開始作兩日辯論，貝文外相以九千字之長文，宣布英國對外政策。據構：（昨日本報收音，已將大要刋出）蘇聯應接受美國務卿貝爾納斯之提議，訂立四國公約，監視德國解除武裝，期限二十五年。予今敢吿蘇聯，若重視和平，高過一切，應勿失去此機會，以免時不再來。予思四國公約如能忠實努力履行，則可造成一種局勢，其安全將遠過於扶掖少數附庸國，以爲侵略之緩衝。六月十七日巴黎會議開會時，四國外長對於和的若不能獲致同意，予將力主以和約問題提交關係各國全體和平大會。局勢已至不能容忍之地步，我人將不得不向積極參戰之二十一國聲明日，祇因四國外長不能同意，各國將永遠處於戰爭狀態之中。貝爾納斯之計劃雖遭蘇聯拒絕，美國應無所畏懼，至少尙有歐洲其他各國不獨歡迎此提議，且認爲對於解除誤會與恢復信任，可與人以最大希望。</p>
<p>法國</p>
<p>對薩爾流域之要求，非俟硏究德國邊境之全部問題後，不能將其任何部份遽行割棄。惟英政府在最後解決辦法中，於顯及賠償及共他工廠等問題外，確贊成以薩爾移交法國，但寗願於採取最後步驟之前，就整個德國問題加以考慮。</p>
<p>蘇聯</p>
<p>宣言英美若由義大利撤退軍隊，義政府即可出蘇聯索取之賠償，此言予未能同意，蘇聯要求以特里埃斯特割與南斯拉夫，亦爲予所反對。予確信下次巴黎會議能使我人對於和平其有更大之信心者，無過於蘇聯準備及願意將奧地利問題與義大利問題及多腦河流域問題一幷解決。中東方面，蘇聯與美國均承認維持英國在中東之地位，對於世界和平有重大關係，惟最後應發展一種區域組織，適合於聯合國穖構之安全制度。</p>
<p>對於</p>
<p>蘇聯，予敢代表英國及其自治領之工人發言，不信蘇聯制度可代表工人利益，一如英國之民主議會制度。惟有許多問題與蘇聯對英態度有關，至少可以顯示一種現實主義思想。英政府之基本目的，在使聯會國機構能進行有效之工作。</p>
<p>多瑙</p>
<p>河航行權與特里埃斯特主權問題，在最近巴黎外長會議中，均爲和平之重大障碍，予對此中歐重要問題不能代表政府讓步。蘇聯提議之義大利南斯拉夫邊界綫，包括特里埃斯特在內，將使義大利境內無一操斯拉夫語之人民，而南斯拉夫境內則有義大利人五十萬以上。對於此一問題，祇有英美兩國曾企圖提出折衷辦法，蘇聯方面則絕無舉動，予不能將特里埃斯特割讓南斯拉夫。特里埃斯特必須爲一國際港，而非國際政局中之賭具。</p>
<p>英國</p>
<p>謀與羅馬尼亞，匈牙利及其他國家訂立商的，曾到處碰壁。英國將不准其代表有何舉動，妨碍蘇聯與各該國之正當關係，但請蘇聯與以同樣之回報。關於韃靻尼爾海峽，予並未知有何種基本爭執。蒙德婁公約准許土耳其重整海峽軍備，英國願意考慮修改此的，但對於妨害土耳其眞正獨立，或使之變爲一附庸國家之任何途徑，則為英國所亟欲避免云。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯定期赴法　外長會議不延期　多瑙河航行問題蘇堅持成見</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓四日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯今日在新聞記者招待會中宣稱：渠定六月十三日首途赴巴黎參加外長會議，隨行者與上次陪同赴巴黎之人員一無二致，其中包括參議員康納利及范登堡二人。在答復記者詢問時，貝氏認爲定期六月十五日召開之巴黎會議殊無延期之理由。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎四日電〕四國外長代表頃賡續開會，討論蘇軍自保加利亞撤退問題，未能商獲成議。蘇代表蓋塞夫發言稱：蘇外長莫洛托夫曾要求蘇軍自保加利亞撒退應與盟軍自義大利撤退同時行之。關於多瑙河航行問題，蘇聯代表堅持成見，謂非沿岸各國不得參加此與莫洛托夫外長在四國外長會議中所採態度前後一致，但關於設立多瑙河航行委員會一項計劃，各代表意見較接近。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盔頓四日合衆電〕貝爾納斯在記者招待會上宣稱：渠已將對奧和的草案送交蘇法英三國，俾在下届外長會議以前加以研究。</p>

<p>〔路透社伍柏達爾五日電〕此間英軍事當局昨透露稱：德國英佔領區內訓練中之半秘密南斯拉夫王家軍隊已奉命解散，事因該軍人員阻撓遣送南斯拉夫人回國之計劃，幷經英情報人員査明其私售軍器之證據後，故決定加以解散。按該軍有將領四十五人，官長一千五百人及士兵一萬五千人，由前南斯拉夫閣員齊夫霍夫斯克將軍指揮，當初均爲被德國所拘獲之戰俘，百分之九十皆擁護國王彼得。</p>

<h3>美國發明飛翼速度近似光速　飛行空中幾不可見</h3>
<p>〔中央社加利福尼亞州霍桑城四日合衆電〕美陸軍部今發表由兩架噴氣引擎所發動之小型諾斯陸浦式飛翼之構造，諾氏設計該機可以近似光速之速度，穿過敵人之飛機機翼，鑄成一堅固之翼片，且全用鎂造成者。此翼之妙用，在攻擊敵機，切斷其機翼或機尾。該機飛行空中，幾不可見，蓋並無機身，吾人僅能見一酷似刀口之機翼，叫嘯越過高空，使駕駛員操縱該機之方式，乃在其他各式飛機中，所不可想像者，機翼僅長卅八英尺，頭尾共畏十四英尺，機上裝機槍四挺，又最近諾氏發明之飛翼轟炸機，刻準備試飛。</p>
<h3>義國公民投票決定　採取共和政制　薩伏伊王室告頌覆</h3>

<h3>蘇勢力深入中歐　斯拉夫民族各國均已依附　是否將適可而止猶未可知</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕據捷克京城消息：中歐及東歐一帶之斯拉夫民族國家，現在結成集團，依附蘇蘇聯，此足證明蘇聯已於戰後短期內將各該國加以組織，並使之傾向蘇聯。其成功如此之速，無怪西方民主國家對之表示關切，尤以蘇聯究擬將其勢力範圈向西擴張至如何程度，更爲憂慮。無論斯拉夫民族國家結成集團與否，但蘇聯勢力之已深入東歐及中歐國家，則　毫無疑間。捷克總統貝奈斯積極支持組織集團，尤值注意。以前斯拉人族之團結，大部份係理論的，但據貝氏宣稱：將來在政治及文化上可成爲事實。此中有一頗爲複雜之關鍵，即斯拉夫國家大部份適在蘇聯久欲建立之勢力範圍以內，即北起德國港口斯丹丁，南至新波蘭，捷克，奧地利，以迄亞德里亞海一帶，同時匃牙利及巴爾幹諸國亦在其內，惟希臘與土耳其除外。斯拉夫人大部份係在子午綫十五度以東各地，除俄羅斯人外，計有波蘭人捷克人，斯洛伐克人，哥羅地亞人，塞爾維亞人及保加利亞人等。試閱地圖，子午綫十五度以東地帶與斯丹丁至亞德里亞海之蘇聯勢力圈相符合。此種情形是否偶然，抑含有更重大之意義，則除非蘇聯表明其是否擬將其勢力範圍擴張至英吉利海峽外，吾人殆無從得知。蘇聯將欲控制奧國，大的並無疑問，但於控制奧國後是否將適而止，則殊難逆料。蘇聯野心有否止境，或將繼續向前擴張，不得而知。吾人須知蘇聯擴張其勢力之方法固不止一端，其中之一，即爲向各國宣傳共產主義，以建立蘇維埃政府，此亦爲西方民主國家憂慮原因之。蘇聯仍思插足於地中海一帶，遠東亦有數大問題亟待解決，除非蘇聯企圖，一無限止，吾則在歐洲獲得滿足之期常在不遠。</p>

<p>改用國旗</p>
<p>法官問：「你何時開始與誰討論組織僞政權？」答：「廿七年春和陳錦濤陳羣等。」問：「是否和松澤孝良，南本四雄接洽？」答：「想不起來，是由陳羣向日本軍部參謀長接洽的。」問；「和重光葵談過嗎？」答：「沒有，日本大使館曾派淸水書記官來接洽的。」問：「偽維新政府之二院入部是誰負責？」答：「除我長行政院外，溫宗堯長立法院，財政部陳錦濤，綏靖部任援道，司法部胡成泰，內政部陳羣，外交部陳籙，實業部黃子輝，敎育部陳則民，鐵道部蔣紹梅。」問：「你改甩五色旗？」答：「因爲日軍侮辱國人縣國旗，乃改用五色旗。」問：「綏靖部人員有多少？」答：「大的有四師，軍長任緩道，號稱二萬，其實受審時之梁鴻志（兪創碩攝）不到此數。」問：「稅收如何？」答：「由邵式軍之蘇浙皖稅局征收之，每月的有八九百萬。」問」：日僞合辦之華中各公司，日方資金多少？」答：「不知，我們合作，不過爭回主權。」</p>

<h3>康樂酒樓盛會　報人歡迎老報人　于院長暢論報事　勗記者加緊努力</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午，本報社長潘公展，新聞報社長程滄波，假座康樂酒樓，舉行茶會，歡迎最近自京來滬之監察院于院長，被邀作陪者，有王芸生·胡樸安。徐寄廎。王曉籟·査良鑑·胡健中·周謙冲等五十餘人。于院長銀髯飄拂，藍布單袍，精神瞿鑠，藹然可親。昨日天氣奇熱，揮扇不止，而演說時辭氣激越，語語有力，令人想見其民初鼓吹革命，凌厲無前之風度。</p>
<p>首由程滄波氏致詞，譽于院長爲「報界之老祖宗」，並謂在重慶大轟炸時，于氏仍不改其愛護新聞界之熱誠，各報負責人聚商出聯合版時，即在于氏私邸也。</p>
<p>于院長即於熱烈掌聲中起立致辭，略謂上海爲全國新聞最多之地，全國報館，亦以上海爲最多，數十年來，上海始終爲許多重大事件關鍵之所在，故上海實新聞記者之上海。凡爲新聞記者，應知以前專制，眾閥，抗日各時代之情形，體察當前新時代之意義。此次來滬，得見上海新聞事業之發達，與新聞記者之活潑。均逾往昔，令人興奮。上海之新聞價値愈高，即上海之地位愈高，中國地位之所繫，亦在於此。抗戰期間，重慶報界苦幹之精神，實即承繼戰前上海報界之精神也，抗戰現已成功，全國各界仍注目於上海報紙，蓋上海一切機器印刷等條件，均較他處爲優，望各同志認淸此點，切勿輕易放棄，須知此一地位，關係國家及全世界者甚大。</p>
<h3>得人心則興失人心則亡</h3>
<p>報紙即人民之軍隊，報紙佔領地方，與軍隊佔領地方同，敵人侵略之初，先至上海，極力蹂躪上海各報館及文化機關，即因彼等深知此爲一極大之力量。然新聞記者實不祗爲報館服務，而係爲人類服役，如報館故意作不正當之主張，即不爲人民所歡迎，其力量頓失，故報紙之力量固大，人民之權威更大，千百年來，得人心則典，失人心則亡，同仁應本斯旨，邁開大步，向前猛進。民元本人辦報時，報館上下職員，皆往從軍，報紙幾不能出版，余乃吿彼等曰：「一枝筆較多少槍更寳貴，真要做革命黨，一枝筆此多少槍更有力量」。時至今日，記者之責任愈重，深望努力。</p>
<p>旋由地方法院院長查良鑑稱。新聞界與司法界關係極深，故太平洋戰爭發生前，惟法院人員與新聞記者所受威迫利誘甚至暗殺者最多。在此新時代，新世界，新中國中，領事裁判權已吿取消，法院益感責任重大，望新聞界能與法院合作，共奠法治基礎。徐寄廎氏稱：彼當年亦係時事新報記者，深佩于院長辦報之精神，至今彼仍無一張報不看，無一條新聞不讀。王曉籟謂：新聞記者可爲「監察委員之委員」，協助糾舉，事半功倍。王芸生謂；上海新聞界應繼承抗戰時期之精神，爲建國而努力。彼億及于院長昔年曾與梁任公筆戰，因梁氏過譽珠江流域人才之盛，遂爲由黃河流域來之于氏所駁，今日局面，萬一發生分裂，則必有南北之爭存在，于院長應爲北方多多主張，因政府實不能不保有北方也。（時于院長答謂此次筆戰已在四十二年之前。）胡健中稱：新聞界如能配合監察司法二院工作，收效必宏。又謂今日辦報，已成一種企業，文人辦報或政論界辦報之時代，實已過去。至於黃色新聞，則新聞界無論爲國家，爲社會，爲報格，均應加以警覺，予以抵制。</p>
<h3>糧貸舞弊決不客氣</h3>
<p>于院長答記者</p>
<p>于院長於答本報記者問：（一）關於糧貸金舞弊案，正在嚴査中，如果屬實，則「對他們決不客氣」！（二）關於公務員待遇事，自應以生活指數爲標準，但國庫之負担未免太大。此事不久當可確定，即將發表。（三）淸査各地接收事宜，監院將派出七個調査團，分往各地調査，惟人選尙未決定。</p>
<p>自左至右程滄波，錢新之，于院長，潘公展，周謙冲（本報兪創碩攝）</p>
<h3>歡迎田主教</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國首任繼機田耕莘主教，日前由美抵滬，昨日下午七時，吳市長特假新生活俱樂部設宴歡迎。</p>
<p>天主敎醫師公會，慈善事業協助會等八十四公團，今日下午五至七時，假震且大學舉行酒會，歡迎田耕莘大主敎。</p>
<h3>殺人魔王吳世保之妻　敵偽時期隻手遮天的「紅人」　提審富孀佘愛珍　對所控各點非言不知即稱無此事　豈怕丟醜？　不讓記者攝影以手亂揮　說道：「有啥拍頭」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在敵僞時期與李逆士羣之妻進吉卿並稱爲上海兩大富　之僞特工惡魔吳世保之妻佘愛珍，昨日下午在提監橋高院特二刑庭，由楊鼎推事曁李書記官錦章審訊，被吿延兪鍾駱律師辯護。</p>
<p>佘衣黑綢團花旗袍，梳髻，足登尖口黑布鞋淡黃紗襪，手握白紗手絹，面色白晰淸　。由楊推事一一質詢，被吿從容回答，對於所控各節，非言「不知」，即稱「無此事」。攝影記者爲之照相時，或轉頭他顧，或以手絹掩面，頗露窘態。於審訊終結，押回監途中時，攝影記者又包圍之，佘一面以手帕亂揮，一面奔跑，咕嚕說「有啥拍頭」，「討厭來」，引起旁觀者哈哈大笑。</p>
<p>佘於庭上操純粹上海話，供稱：四中六歲，廣東人，住愚園路七四九弄四十九號，在待工總部警衛隊當會計，家有一子一女，財產則已全部呈報軍統局，所稱財產價値五萬萬元事，佘稱沒有。又說或係現在物價漲了所致。於三十歲時嫁與吳世保，當時吳在賭台任事。廿八年加入僞組織，担任七十六號之警衛隊隊長，由李士羣管轄，丈夫進去後不能回來，我亦就在是年五月住進担任會計之職，但此僅係「由相相」性質，掛名而　吳世保識字，但並不通順，與李士羣之認識，係由朋友之介紹。加人動機，則係由李士羣吿稱「在先生」將來滬，保護淪陷區老百姓，故需組織警衛隊保護「汪先生」。當時並不知即爲調査統計局，至本人與陳璧君僅見過一面，與周佛海李士羣丁默邨妻等則相識，但並未有結拜姊妹等事。我沒有進任何帮，亦沒有收什麽徒弟，對於帮會輩份等事全係外行。至控我曾任七十六號之參謀及副官主任等職，根本無此事，我祇是一個普通女人而已。至說我訓練特工人員，我自己沒有思想，怎可來訓練別人的思想。至說逮捕殺害政治犯等，即我不懂什麽政治，沒有什麽主張，吳世保在時亦從未開過一槍，槍斃過一個人。綁票勒索包辦賭博運土等事，或係常時混亂局面下，別人幹後，將責任都推在七十六號身上。而吳世保行事，亦全聽命於李士羣，部內組織複雜，我並不顧問，所以說不淸楚。吳世保祇是一個隊長而已。吳做了一年後，即辭去不幹，李士羣疑其有叛變之心，故加以拘禁五十多天。釋出後之第三天，隨李士羣至蘇州，即爲日人害死。時爲民國三十年陰歷十二月十九日。</p>
<p>方液仙夫人請伸冤</p>
<p>法官詢問七士六號大舉殺害中國銀行職員等事，佘皆梅不知。至此庭上傳詢證人方戴氏，方鳴咽供稱：現年五十五歲，寗波人，丈夫方液仙，前爲中國化學工業社經理，於廿九年七月廿五日爲七十六號部下持槍綁架而去，至今生死不明，遞狀要求伸寃。庭上以之質問被吿，余稱不知。並言：吳世保在時非法事未曾做。當時犯法，上面亦要管，一切事情並不如此簡單，一切可請詳細調査。</p>
<p>庭上繼以七十六號第四處處長沈鳳崗在軍統局所供，指吳世保行事皆有其妻參與之語質之佘愛珍，佘稱究竟是沈所幹事多，還是吳所幹事多，要求庭上提沈鳳崗對質。</p>
<p>至檢察官問陷害中央人員事，佘稱：根本沒有害過一人。當時「李士羣李太太」，「丁默邨丁太太」等皆住七十六號內，我有何大權可管。</p>
<p>至吳世保收徒弟事，佘含湖其詞，供稱：係李士羣所招收，警衛隊員共祇五十多人，其中張國震，後亦爲日人所害，潘達夏仲明等，則亦爲特工總部人物。</p>
<p>昨日爲調査庭，審訊至此，庭諭改期再訊。辯護律師要求准予被吿與家屬見面，庭諭允准，佘即與其女當庭耳語數分鐘後，仍由法警還押。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕江陰大屠殺案主犯「江陰之虎」下田次郎，昨午由第一綏靖軍事法庭再度提審。下田於上次公審時承認去年中秋節夜間，江陰憲兵隊內確有我方地下工作人員被殺，惟否認其本人曾參與其事，並提出前隊內兵長尾茂田青義，尾崎福造崛田國雄，尾崎賢一等四人可證明其於出事時間，業已酒醉睡熟，請庭上調査等情。昨午開庭時，首提被吿下田次郞，下甲衣草綠色軍服，持軍帽，足登長統黃色皮靴，狀頗鎭靜。庭長詳訊。當時喝酒淸形後，即提第一證人尾茂田青義訊問。尾茂對下田吃酒答稱不知追。遂提第二證人尾崎福造，據稱下田是否喝醉，不知道。不過聽說許多人醉了。至是再訊第三證人崛田國雄，則謂當夜　到下田等醉了，因爲看到他跟　　吵架。庭長遂間要不要再傳第四證人尾崎賢一，下田說不必了，他們都年輕，到庭上來害怕，不敢說。再傳目睹血案：證人江陰中學校長章郁仁，章年的五十餘，蒼白瘦削，戴眼鏡，確言是夜被殺之第十一人第十二人，係下田動手，彼爲第十三人，因平時表面上任敵人特務，實為地下工作，與下田素善，故爲下田救下，藏於厠所內。下田實爲其救命恩人，惟因下田往時殺人太多，故決不顧私恩，來此作證。林檢察官提出結論稱：被吿所提證人，對於被吿是否酒醉一節，均無確證，且言辭矛盾，反之目睹血案之證人章郁仁，確曾被捕，且性命爲被吿所救，當不致誣證。請庭上依法判刑，義務律師錢乃文起立吿辯護，大意謂被吿以往殺人一簡，不涉本案，現所應硏討者，爲八月十五日之事，査當日係中秋節，且係於聞悉投降之後，被吿可能以酒澆愁而飲醉。至於章郁仁所言當時情形，似過於詳細，反令人生疑。最後，庭長宣稱木案辯論終結，定本月八日下午二時宣判。</p>

<h3>京滬浙六千大學生　教部正籌劃分發　國立大學多感校舍不敷</h3>
<p>〔本報南京專訊〕在抗戰期間，智識青年從軍，包括公敎人員及學生，爲數約十萬人，其中大學生與高中畢業或相當程度者約一萬人，至五月底退伍，須由教部分發至國立各大學復學。重慶方面有此項學生八千餘人，由敎部在渝留守人員，秉承部長意旨，就近爲謀分發及安插。浙江方面，有此項學生一千八百五十四人，已由該管當局函敎育部，陳報學生須復學名額，請教部爲之分發，連南京上海兩地臨時大學補習班與先修班學生合計，爲數約六千人，須分發各大學。南京中央大學方面負責人表示：該校有學生四千一百人，現在校舍僅可勉容學生四千人，再加署後招生數百人，校舍實有不敷容納之苦。上海方面，雖有交通，曁南，同濟，上海醫學院與商學院，及復旦等國立學校，然因從前原來學生不多，故校舍不寬，此時學生比戰前加多，又有校舍燬於抗戰過程中者，對收容新生，亦感校舍不敷，故各校皆以校舍爲當前最大問題。敎部對六千大學生之分發，正竭力籌劃分配，總期各校多所收容，因分發多係公費，勢須國立學校，如分發私立學校，則公費較難担負云。（壹）</p>

<h3>英學生普遍募款　救濟中國難童</h3>

<h3>普魯望斯的荷馬</h3>
<p>— 錫壽</p>
<p>普魯望斯（Provence）是法國南部的省份，陽光和煦，土地乾沃，風景佳麗，以產橄欖、葡萄、桑、橘等著名。該地言語響朗，和諧，而且富於詞謀，非特能表現具體而動目的東西，且可傳達最敏銳的思想與最高雅的情操。風俗迥異，頗具希臘情調。</p>
<p>法朗沙·米司脫雷（Frangois　Mistral）是一個樂天的忠厚的農夫，在他五十六歲時，續娶了少女阿黛拉嬝德（Adelakle）或作Delaide）妻，生下這位普魯望斯的荷馬。</p>
<p>一八三〇年九月八日，在馬伕阿納的敍善農舍（Mas　de　Juge）裏產下這位未來的大詩人，取名弗萊特呂（Frederic）。他的童稚時代在田野間度過，從小就感受了南方田野的美，聽了普魯望斯所有的諺語，歌謠，吸收了同省人的智慧。弗萊特呂·米司脫雷長大時，戀戀不捨地離開了家鄕，往阿維濃去念書，稍遲轉到愛克斯去讀法科。法科畢業，在八月裏的一夜，要緊趕回家鄕。父親任他自由選擇職業。數月後，他說道：</p>
<p>「充滿着這種樣子的激浪，這種普魯望斯的膨脹的力塡滿了我底心，不由自主地傾向於整個文藝感應或治理上。獨立不覊的精神保護着我，什麽都不能來擾亂我。一晚，正在播種的時候，我看見那些農夫在田溝裏一邊歌唱，一邊跟着犂兒前進，就在這時，我開始着手米賴嬝（Mireille）的第一首詩。」</p>
<p>他旣從事文學，即以普魯望斯語文應用於文學爲職志，所有著作均以土語寫成。並且在一八五四年五月二十一日，聯合其他六位南方詩人羅麥尼（Joscph　Roumanille），渥罷奈（Theodore　Aubanel，馬發安（Anselme　Mathieu），塔望（Alphonse.Tavan），徐愛拉（Paul　Giera）和勃呂納（Jean　Brunet）在阿維濃附近的風珊居岸古堡裏創立番立勃爾社（Felibres。Felibres這字是借自一首民間的占讚美歌PO-rison　de　SaintoAnselme。在這首歌中表現耶穌在廟裏與七智（Sept　felibres）討論。該社的宗旨是「保存普魯望斯語文，氣質，自由的步法，國家的榮譽以及卓絕的智慧。」他們底著作發表於一八五五年創辦的L'Almanach　provencal該社的主腦就是米司脫雷，羅麥尼和渥罷奈三人。一八五九年自米氏的詩集米賴嬝刋出後，即受各社員贊賞，一躍而爲領袖，他憑了無可相比的才能，不倦的精神與無私的態度，把一生全放在番立勃爾運動上。</p>
<p>米司脫雷的詩從來不是坐在書房裏作成的，而是處身在曠野裏，一邊踱着，把自己與大自然呼成一氣，一邊念出他的詩歌。他難得站停了記錄在手册上，因爲記憶力很强。在他底名著米賴嬝和加朗達（Calendal　1867）裏，其有普魯望斯的壯健的呼吸，肌肉發達的動作，自由淳樸的性格，　腸，肥沃的平原，南方的北風，山和海的野性，以及普魯望斯的風俗，聖傳，風景等。</p>
<p>在行吟時代，雄龍（Villon）時代，文藝復興時代，古典主義時代以及浪漫主義時代，那班詩人也算探求着希臘占風,一味歌詠些沙龍婦人，宮女，少婦為情人窺伺或窺伺着情人，大抵出乎一個模型。很少見過像米氏那樣的歌詠女人。他的米組嬝裏的主角文生和米賴嬝，好比羅蜜歐和朱麗葉。少女米賴　現出文雅，害羞，戀情和恭敬等狀。在整首詩裏耀出她底奕奕的神采以及純美。</p>
<p>『米賴嬝，在她十五芳齡…………愉快的　陽把她開放了，她底臉又鮮監又天眞，如花的頰上有兩個笑渦。她底注視就是一滴消散哀痛的甘露……聳起的胸脯是一只碩大的桃子，還不十分成熟。她極愛嬸戲，十分活潑，可是稍爲有點　野！…………呵！見了這種秀美，竟會把一杯水一口氣吞下……』</p>
<p>音樂家古諾（Gounod）曾將米賴嬝譜曲，以爲歌劇，廣行於世。</p>
<p>一八五五年乃父逝世，米氏就親自管理這所叙善農舍。一八五八年春天，他初次旅行巴黎，在那裏被阿道夫。巨馬（Adolphe　Dumas）介紹給馬丁。拉氏讀了他的詩，讚賞不止。</p>
<p>米氏從事加朗達有七年之久，最末一節詩寫了將近六個月；但是他還不敢輕易放手，因爲他要仔仔細細地琢磨辭句，尋找更響亮的韻調……他眞是一位勇敢的詩人。詩中主角是一個加西少年——一個捕　白魚的小漁夫，他爲了戀愛一位名呌愛司旦蘭的女子，使他成爲一個英雄，做了許多非常的事。有一次，他想做富人，發明了一種捕魚器，可以把海裏的魚都趕近碼頭來。又一次，是一個亞拉烏勒山谷的强盜，被加朗達追進賊巢裏去……加朗達眞是一個可畏的孩子！在呂　石岩中，有一個高得達不到的柏林，從來沒有一個　夫敢上去過。加朗達竟敢上去，他獨自在那裏住了一個月，在這一個月裏，人家只聽見砍樹的斧聲。那些巨大的老　，一根一根倒在滐淵裏。當加朗達下來時，沒有一根栢樹在山上了。……後來，因了這許多功績，這個小漁夫終於得到了愛司且蘭的愛情。</p>
<p>米氏曾把自己底大部份著作譯成法文，法國文壇上認爲大作家之一·一八六一年他得學士院獎金，一一八六三年得名譽十字章。米氏的著作，除了上述種種優點外，還有語文與民族學的價値。自一八七八至一八八六年，他還出版了二册普—法字典，書名呌番社的寳典（Lou　Tresordoufelibrige），那是普魯望斯語的最良的字典，曾經再版過。自一八九九年起，他就開始組織一個阿爾博物館（Musee　arlesien），直至一九〇九年在阿爾城的拉凡爾古邸中成立。一九〇五年米氏獲得半個諾貝爾文學獎金。其他主要著作還有小說奈脫（Nerte　1884），悲劇藏納后（La　Reine　JEeanne1890）回憶錄　Mesorigines,memoires　et　recis　1906，詩歌金島（Lis　Isclo　Dor　1876）詠羅納河（Le　pOEME　duRh　one　1897），聖人的領聖體（Communion　des　Saints　1859與橄欖園（Les　Olivades　1912）等。</p>
<p>米司脫雷也一九一四年二月二十三日逝世，享壽八十四歲。</p>
<p>米氏的詩可說是無法翻譯的，現在姑且把傑作米賴嬝裹的一首譯意如後，以爲本文的結束。譯文僅能傳達原意，不能表現原文之美，自在意中。麥茄麗（Magali）吓，我的愛，麥茄麗，請你把頭　着窗，聽一聽這個晨樂。大鼓和提琴合奏。天邊邊蒲佈繁星，可是風已經靜默，星星看見我的愛，立刻漸漸地變淡。『不過是樹枝在喃語，我眞掛慮你的晨樂！我要投入栗色的海，做一條體石裏的鰻。』「吓，麥茄麗，如果你做波浪中的魚兒，那麽我，我是漁夫，我將一繼把你撈起！』『哦！假使你做漁夫，當你投下魚　，我便變爲飛鳥，飛到荒野裏去。』「吓！麥茄麗，如果你做了空中的烏，那麽我是獵人，一鎗把你打下。「吓！麥茄麗，如果你成爲可憐的死屍，那麽我變爲土地，好好地懷抱着你！」『現在我方始相信你不是把我戲弄，這是我的玻璃指環，美少年，給你做紀念！」「吓，麥茄麗，你加惠我！它們一經見到你，吓，麥茄麗，瞧那些星，它們已經熄滅乾凈。』</p>
<h3>綠榕紅荔之鄉</h3>
<p>— 克諦</p>
<p>生活在戰爭的氣氛裏，我常常不能自主地被驅上夢想不到的旅程，記得是一九四二年的初夏，我吿別了山城，循着崎嶇險峻的西南公路奔向東南，爲了調劑旅途的辛苦與勞頓，沿途得以小駐，領略一些値得追憶的風土人情，點綴這疲困的旅程：在貴陽，幽美秀麗的花溪；在桂林，險峻奇特的山峯和烟雨迷漫的灕江；在衡陽，混濁急流的湘江和隱約的南嶽的峯影，……曾經一駐遊踨，而各地風俗習慣和語言的迥然不同，更　趣味。</p>
<p>因為是時敵憲在浙　路一帶底瘋狂的侵擾，不但阻止了我底前進，更增加了突然來的生命底危險，於是又被打入難民羣裏開始作第三次的逃難了，從上饒連夜出發，爬過閩贛交界的分水關，　着艱辛與危險，走進了緣榕紅茘之鄕——福建。</p>
<p>初人這樣一個參想不到的境界，一切都引起我底新奇特別的感覺，向來在我底腦海裏，猜想她一定是一個氣候非常惡劣多瘴氣疫癘的地方，而且一切都比較落後，然而我的理想，被面對着的事實矯正了許多，漸漸由探奇而生出了愛戀之情了。</p>
<p>我愛看那龐大陰醫的常總的榕樹，在她底繁蔭裏，我常常約着友伴們作愉快的野餐；我愛聽那閩江上船夫們趕灘時與激流搏鬥的雄渾的歌聲，使人聰了油然而生世途艱辛之感；而最吸引人的郤是特產的楊梅和茘校，以極廉的代價可以換來鮮美無此的東西，誰都會貪而無饜的。</p>
<p>由於工作的覊絆，我在這綠榕紅茘之鄕一住半年多，由新奇的試探心理漸漸變成愛戀的熱情了，我學習複雜的閩語，我愛聽奇異的福州地方戰，我愛永安底燕水之濱，我貪浴着有名的福州底溫泉，無形中我底生活習慣和嗜好也被我底環境而同化了。</p>
<p>現在，在破碎支離的追憶中，偶然擷取一些寗　的夢影，然而，它畢竟是永遠値得回味的。</p>
<h3>建設與美術</h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>在過去八年中上海美術家們，供獻到國家者，比較最少，但是，我們並沒有放棄本位上的工作。也敢說：從本位上都有相當的努力。</p>
<p>從今日起，都要向着建設的路上前進，要建設現代的國家，物質與精神，應該同時並進；兩者如左右手，不可或缺，因此，在發動物質建設的新興國家，便不該忘記促成精神的建設。在積極需要提倡科學的中國，對於美術，也應該有積極推動的必要。</p>
<p>八年以前，理，農，醫，工，者得最重要，太把藝術漠視，這次經過抗戰期種種測騐，便不該忘記心理上的一個基礎，我們更知道民族生命的向上發展，有一半是站在文化上面。</p>
<p>美術的振興，一方面要靠政府與社會，一面是靠作家，政府來策劃與提倡以及獎勵，作家來研究和製作乃至創造，要有這樣的配合，必能發見效果。而同時社會上每一個人，都應負連帶提携的責任。</p>
<p>上海已有美術協會的組織，經過愼重和完密的籌備，先在本市舉行盛大的作品展覽。至於會中要做的工作。如美術館的籌設，美術刊物的發行，各地巡迥展覽，以及對國際上的美術宜傳等等；都希望每一位作家發出自身的熱力，期以羣策羣力來輔助我們國家的建設！</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛　（四六）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>轉眼冬至，北京的天氣比荆州冷得多，屋子裏都結了冰。置華有些受不住這嚴寒的襲擊，對於功課，便不免懈怠起來。</p>
<p>有一天，張弦要敎麗華練身段工夫。麗華這時正學着「貴妃醉酒」一齣戲，張弦呌她脫去棉衣，只穿一件單衫，讓她表演幾個折腰的姿勢。麗華不肯，張弦便强迫她。麗華終於學了半截，支持不住，昏倒地上了！當她醒來的時候，發覺自己被緊摟在張弦的懷裏，而且依然只穿着一件單衫。於是數月前的記憶，立刻又浮漾到腦海裏，她怒不可遏地推開張弦，拿起棉衣就往外走。但是張弦也變了臉，厲聲地叱止：</p>
<p>「練下去！不許走。」</p>
<p>麗華不聽，倔强地回答他：</p>
<p>「偏走！看你能把我怎麽樣？你這個壞人，你不配作我的師父！」</p>
<p>這些話激得張弦羞惱成怒。不由分說，一手拉住麗華，一手便揮動戲台上用的馬鞭子，狠狠地打在她的週身。可憐那已經凍餒的皮肉，被打得血跡斑斑，遍體鱗傷！</p>
<p>麗華在地上滾着，劇痛之下，不禁高聲哭喊救命，然而竟沒有一點反應。因爲這也是張弦事先向墨太太講好的條件，他聲明有權利責打徒弟，不許別人干涉。因此，儘管墨太太聽見麗華的呼號，可也不便過來制止，或勸解。、</p>
<p>「聽不聽話？」張弦故意停了停，大聲「名正言順」地問麗華。「現在好好地再從頭給我練一遍！」</p>
<p>麗華不敢遠扭，只得爬了起來，可是站立不住！四體疼得發抖。張弦以爲是反抗他，便氣冲冲又用力地在她的屁股上打了一鞭子。這時，麗華大呌一聲，眼前一黑，驀地跌下去，魂魄像飛絮一般　！出了軀売！</p>
<p>張弦睹狀，恐怕鬧出人命禍來，只好住了手，把麗華抱起，替她穿上了綿衣。用冷水把她噴醒。然後，裝作氣咻咻的樣子，喊了墨太太來。</p>
<p>「你這位小姐的脾氣眞大，打兩下就氣得死去活來，以後我是不敢再敎下去了，您另請高明吧！」張弦說着，拿起胡琴就要走。　墨太太看見麗華那種奄奄一息的樣子，雖然有些心疼女兒，可是爲了要實現自己的虛榮夢幻，又不能不忍痛讓女兒把這個學習的難關渡過去，加上，　並不懷疑是張弦虐待麗華。她完全相信張弦的話，她知道麗華的性情確是不好。所以她不但沒有怪罪張弦，反而向張弦道歉，再三請他原諒麗華，請他仍舊敎下去。而且自動地願意從明年起，每月增加學費爲四十吊錢。</p>

<h3>白桐油出口稍活　成本太高交通不便　外銷前途困難尙多</h3>
<p>白桐油出口貿易，自戰後間斷八年，一時不易恢復，戰前每月平均總在五六千噸左右，自上年滬埠收復後，迄前月止，僅三數千噸出口，乃上月份因漢桐稍廉，滬上到貨絡繹不絕，出口亦漸趨熱鬧，共約一千五六百噸，較戰前不可同日而語，惟環顧世界物價，我國獨高，所以對外貿易非經過調整，難期發展，近日漢桐到源仍有相當數量，行家開進六萬四五千元，批售六萬六七千元，洪江桐油依然如故，去盈豐正洪十萬〇五千元，大昌豐西副八萬元，蕭恒慶七萬八千元，大有豐七萬六千元，徐榮昌劉慶元豐七萬三四千元銷塲未勤，市少上落。</p>
<p>又記，中國植物油料廠，在重慶·萬縣·漢口·長沙·香港·九龍·梧州·及上海等地，均設有煉製桐油廠，其規模較大者，為萬縣廠，產量每月可達兩千噸左右，其他各廠，亦可達五百至一千餘噸，除一部份供應內銷外，其餘均銷往歐美各國，以香港上海爲分別集中轉口地，上月份在上海輸出者，的一千噸，每噸計二千市担，每担計價六萬七千元，本月份業已在上海輸出一千噸，共計五千六百桶，據該廠負責人聲稱，近因內地物價不能減低，交通工具缺乏，時間浪費，以及裝備材料困難之種種牽制，故成本與外銷價格，不能取得平衡，欲謀打開僵局則全恃成本減低，交通暢連，最重要者，若輪船業能恢復散倉駁船輸送，則大量桐油，可源源而來，非但不致凍結，且可增加外洋銷路，爭取外匯，鞏固國際貿易市塲云。</p>

<p>工程師節特刊</p>
<h3>今年工程師節　當前之若干問題</h3>
<p>— 趙祖康</p>
<p>今年六月六日爲第六届工程師節，適値抗戰勝利之第一年，吾工程界同人紀念斯節，似有兩種特殊意義：第一爲吾人貢獻抗戰之檢討，第二爲吾人負責建國之策勵。我國經八年艱苦抗戰過程之中，我工程界同人苦心孤詣，不斷努力。對於工業，則設立工廠，兵工廠等，創造機械與製品，以滅少物質與軍需品缺乏之困難；對於交通，則興築重要鐵路；公路飛機塲等以流通軍品物資之運輸。此種貢獻，原屬我全體工程界不磨之功績，然以較之盟邦工程界之貢獻，則相形之下，未免見細。今者抗戰勝利，吾人應如何繼續努力，爭取世界第一流之技術水準，與吾國之一等强國地位相稱，此爲吾人檢討抗戰貢獻應有之認識。建國之意義甚廣，經濟建設如開闢資源，發展交通，增加生產，繁榮都市與農村均係吾工程界之任務，且較之抗戰工作尤爲艱巨；蓋現時我國交通阻礙，生產萎縮，物價高翔，工潮澎湃，欲談經濟建設，誠非易事，惟有利用最新科學技術，開發蘊藏，同時納勞力之正軌，發揮其效能俾地盡其利，人盡其力，庶可使國家進於富强康樂之境，此吾人對於負責建國應有之策勵也。茲就一時感想所及，略舉吾人努力之幾條特殊的途徑如次：</p>
<p>（一）硏究原子力之利用一切工程技術隨科學發明而進展，如蒸汽發明，而工程機械以利用蒸汽爲主：電學昌明，而工程機械以利用電力爲主。在此次大戰過程中，已利用原子爲破壞之工具，勝利之後，歐美各國對於原子能乏研究，不遺餘力除軍事需要而外，並硏究如何應用於一般機械，在美國且已有駛行原子火車之議，依此趨勢，將來當不難有普遍利用原子發動力之一日。吾工程界同人處此原子時代，似應急起直追，特加注意，由政府與工業界及工科大學合作，設立原子硏究機構，以從事研究原子科學與工程應用之配合。</p>
<p>（二）參加開發東北資源之工作我東北資源，極爲鹽富，日人銳意經營，具有成績。此次大戰，敵人即利用之以爲侵略我之基地之一。東北磷產，以煤鐵爲主；農產則以米·麥·高梁·黃豆爲大宗；廣大之森林，可供木材之用；鐵路網遠較關內爲密，重工業如鋼鐵·軍火·機器·紡織廠等，的佔全國百分之七十。是以東北一地，久爲列强所注意。現聞重工業之機器，有百分之八十已遭拆運，夫東北人口，以平均一般而論，並不稠密，總數祇有三千萬人，如以長城以南爲比例，當可增加三倍，故我工程界同人之志在四方者，似可相率前往，參加積極開發工作，爲其他從業人員之倡。</p>
<p>（三）領導工人訓練保持紀律——紀律訓練與技術訓練同等重要，無技術，工程難臻完善；無紀律，則工作效率不能增高。勝利以後。就上海一地而論，因生活費高漲之故，各業工人，相繼罷工，要求增加工資，其中有因工資提高而生產反見低落，於是資方無法維持，停閉工廠，或減少工作時間者；其未復業之工廠，則深具戒心，閉歇如故。此種情况，卒至兩敗俱傷，殊爲民族工業前途懼。吾人應知生活艱苦，爲大戰後普遍之現象，工人待遇，固應隨時爲必要之調整，而工作允須親吾工程界同人領導羣衆，，善爲指導，以期激發愛國情緒，轉移風氣，共同向建設之途邁進，是則國家之大幸也。</p>
<h3>港口與吾國建設</h3>
<p>— 施孔懷</p>
<p>一國之民生經濟文化，咸賴交通而進展。近世交通工具之發達，日異而月新，陸上則有鐵路與公路，空中則有航運。但截至最近，尤其是目今中國交通之重點，仍在於水道。而水道之運輸則自以港口爲其樞紐。凡國際貿易之出入，以及大宗貨物之集散均於此吞吐。抗戰勝利迄今已逾九月，工業生產依然停頓，物價仍難低落，民生之痛苦猶未解除者，其最重大之原因，即亦於交通之未能恢復，運輸之未能暢通。然則此後之一切建設，首應注重交通，已爲極明顯之事實。以目下我國物力財力之貧乏，言航空則製造大量飛機，談何容易，言鐵路公路，以目前材料之昂貴，修理尙艱，遑論興建。即如平漢路津浦路北寗路等，至今尙未能暢通無阻。各公路亦以汽車缺乏，載運量小，未能各盡其用。惟水道港口，則恢復最易。長江之航運，已日見其增加。上海港口雖遭砲火洗禮，而繁榮之恢復，迅速異常。蓋港口不易破壞，而永道多成於天然，不需要多量之人力興築。且中國水道港口又多；此正天賦之利。是以儘量利用水道港口，發展交通，以爲一切建設之先導，實於我國國情及目下之經濟財政狀况，最爲適當。</p>
<p>我國港口規模之比較完備者，有上海廣州靑島等處。但國際貿易之盛，首推上海。故目前之急應致力者，爲（一）浚疏航道，以暢航運。査抗戰期間，港口航道碼頭，均失疏浚，河床淤淺，勢所必至。不特此也，用以疏浚之船隻設備，又都被日軍移用失散。現以殘缺不全之設備，從事於八年來未浚之工程，其艱苦可知。必也補充設備，努力工作，俾能完成任務。（二）修建碼頭倉庫，以容船舶與貨物。考之歷史，大戰之後，海運頻繁，理有固然。戰前平時所用之倉庫碼頭，戰後頓感不敷。必也酌量添建，俾船有碼頭可並，貨有倉庫可堆。（三）添置大小輪船，以便客貨運輸。査戰前吾國船舶總噸位，本不甚大，戰時復大遭破壞加之，不平等條約取消後，外國船隻不能行駛揚子江及沿海一帶，船荒之感，自在意中。必也積極添建以應需要。（四）改進起卸設備，以求敏捷經濟。我國各港口所有起卸設備，異常簡陋，全賴人工搬移。目前工資如是之高，而工作效能又如是之低，欲求貨價下降，誠非易事。且戰後碼頭起卸貨物，其速率不及戰前遠甚。往往起卸一千噸之貨物，須費一呈期之久，非但加重無謂之費用，且物資流通，亦因起卸之遲鈍而受影響。必也積極裝置機械起卸設備，俾船舶得能早日啓椗離港，物資得能迅速流通，無形中减低貨物起卸費用，轉而降平物價。凡此更仰仗於良好之港口管理；非獨上海爲然，各處港口所應致力者。亦皆不外此數端。若能毅力猛進，對外可以振興國際貿易，對內則各地農產品工業品皆可暢流無阻。蓋船隻之載運量，遠勝於飛機火車汽車之屬，而其費用又較低廉，故爲適合目前國情而言，建設之首要宜重視港口水道。我國自經兵變，一切事業均待復興。復興之道，首在建設。建設之物料，如振興工業所需之機器，改良交通所需之車輪，各項建築所需之材料，現在幾無一不來自外洋，而來自外洋之貨物，又無一不先到達港口，然後再由港口向內陸起運。故港口所負之責任巨大，實爲國家復興所繫。此其一。港口爲貨物出入之咽喉，不僅海運水道須求其暢通，同時與內地之交通，如鐵路，如內河航運，均須求其若百脈之融質，故須有充分之鐵路；充分之內河水道，互相連繫。如是則貨運愈暢，港口愈繁，而鐵道等交通之需求亦愈股。所以港口爲各項交通之總樞，亦爲其他一切交通建設之主腦。此其二。再以言及國內外文化之溝通，經濟之復興。物資之交流，商務之促進，關稅收入之增加等等，莫不首賴港口之發達。故港口在國家之建設上，實處於最重要之地位。如謂建國大計，當自建設港口始，誰曰不宜。</p>
<h3>黃浦江隧道問題</h3>
<p>——鄭華博士在青年會議</p>
<p>昨日（五日）下午二時，之江大學工學院敦請交通部顧問鄭華博士在四川路靑年會演講「黃浦江隧道計劃，」到該校學生工程界來賓五百餘人。鄭博士歷任鐵道部設計科長，首都鐵路輪渡工程處長，對於橋樑隧道輪渡工程，均有極精湛之硏究，於此本市積極推進貫通浦東浦西計劃聲中，鄭博士之意見允値得吾人之珍親。鄭博士認爲建造橋樑，無論高層平層，在現時存在之情形，均難以適合，高層橋樣，其引橋太長，勢將發生不便，而平層橋樑，因浦江中舟楫交通甚繁，更難實現。至建築隧道，如建低層隧道，則施工困難，費用浩大，引道亦長，鄭博士建議建高層隧道，其法用鋼板及鋼筋水泥在岸上製就隧道多節，用挖泥機將河底挖深後，將預製之隧這運至施工地點，逐節沉下啣節，宛成溝通浦東之隧道，隧道之項頂恰在河底，以不阻礙航行爲限。隧道建在中正路附近，進口設在南京路外灘附近，向南下坡降低六十英尺，至中正路附近轉九十度灣道過江。此項建築鄭博士估計所需僅六百萬美金，費時約十八個月，工程不難，建築費不大，技術資本材料二匠，不必仰賴外人，洵爲極良妥之辦法。鄭博士並認爲此項隧道工程，以上地質而論，不必基礎工程，手續至簡便。鄭博士講畢，各界紛紛提出意見硏討，至三時許始散會云。</p>

<h3>DDT</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>天氣炎熱，臭虫蚊蚋，大隊出動，夏夜無眠，日中氏沉，一大苦事。</p>
<p>苦干朋友以爲我們做內勤記者的人，可以免去如此浩劫，實屬謬誤，因爲我們清晨四時　筆歸家正，是筋疲力盡，虫蚋肆虐，真是性命交關。</p>
<p>DDT之風魔一時，良以有也。</p>
<p>到底哪一種牌子有效呢，說來傷心，此項支出，截至現在止，鄙人已在兩萬元以上，結果每晚仍然輾轉反側滴滴涕！滴滴涕！</p>
<p>我知道上當者不止鄙人一名，衛生局局長大人呀，你能不能對那些滑頭貨色取締一下，對那些有真效力的證明一下哩！</p>
<h3>趕出房客外國方法</h3>
<p>— 友琴</p>
<p>紐約城有大地主三人，現已鎯鐺入獄，犯罪的經過是這樣的：</p>
<p>第一個——把兩個小孩裝成魔鬼模樣，身穿金屬碎片拼成的怪報，鐵索琅璫，呌他們躲在擱樓裏咿鳴的，裝着悽凉萬分的幽怨哭聲。</p>
<p>第二個——在房客的浴室　上，挖一小孔，免費請人參觀「西洋鏡」。</p>
<p>第三個——把炸藥埋在房屋底下，再使它爆發，去「嚇走趕不出的房客」。</p>
<p>中國——上海——南京——，都鬧着屋荒，外國何　不是如此？中國的房主二房東們，開口便是「條子」外國房東何　不要錢？觀乎上面這三位大地主，豈非中西一轍？他們的目的，無非想趕走他們屋內的趕不出的房客，趕走房客的目的，無非想把房子出售，或另　他人，結果還不是錢在作崇？</p>
<p>不過，第一個用的方法近乎幼稚兒戲；第二個用的方法太覺「惡形」；第三個用的方法已太　　一些。所以結果還是提將官裏去！終究不及咱們貴國人借用權勢壓迫房客的神通來得廣大啊！</p>
<h3>黃魚市</h3>
<p>— 冰石</p>
<p>暮春之時，長江下流的港口，有一個很大的集期，——這是魚汛的時節。我國一般內河的人，用守舊的捕魚術，大概很盼望知道這大衆化食品集散地的熱鬧罷。</p>
<p>季令隨着人們的計劃到臨，堤岸上含有麈垢味的窒息。房屋却煥然一新，鮮明的紅底黑字：××魚行的字樣，號招了一批「幫洋汛」者；茶　變成了交易所。進出的人眼見在還率增加，臉上都樹着緊張和喜悅。坐下來泡一　，就會有人湊上來，一　話匣，就談得那麼有力。平日說笑話的毛　小夥子，也　着桌子，正經的聽談　水，氣候，風向……等，都是談話的資料。人聲鼎沸裏，　雜着濃馥的酒味。運往內河的小漿船，停泊在內港，　列得整整齊齊。相　着濁黃的江水和堤岸上的緣　，可說一幅美責的鏡頭。</p>
<p>港口泊着小艇型的舢板，隨着白浪顛沛，上下起伏，潮水退去就擱在沙難上。船尾　着××魚行的標旗。這些舢板稱爲「接鮮船」。江邊的土城上，時時有人探望，在那汹湧的江水裏尋覓。風一陣陣送來了寒意人們毫無畏縮，江水撃起了鱗片，向沙灘猛撞。水天相運的交界處，若是現出桅機梢，土城上的人就發狂了。再也不肯鬆他們的目的，直到黑點辦得明白，是捕魚的「飄洋船」，土城上就發出了噪咶。懶懶地橫着的「接鮮船，」像衡鋒似拼力迎着「捕魚船」，浪花四處高飛，活現出划船競賽。</p>
<p>入港的魚船是天大的幸運。魚行家大起騷動，來一個你爭我鬥。魚船主人有了整艙的惹人心愛的魚，大擺其架子。他們那種捉到的魚，都是他們的福份，要不是那能滿　而歸？魚行家爲了抽佣金，少不掉摔拍，結果面情是裁判人和勝利者。通過了守軍和負責機關檢查，該是魚船上的一夥兒享樂日子。魚行替他接風特設大宴——「上岸酒」。咪花眼笑的魚行主人，與高彩烈地陪他的生財之首。</p>
<p>滿　而歸的魚船。靠着風帆推進的力量，塞滿了港內，接頭連尾的櫻花臥着，矗立的檣桿，多得像工廠區的烟囱，濕透了的大魚綱，高高扯起，彷彿戰區的鐵綱。暴雨後放晴，打濕了的風帆，掛在桅桿上。他們上下身黏着魚鱗。魚腥的人一羣一羣開始活動了，購貨物，吃酒，賭博，宿妓。……造成了汽油燈下的晚市。</p>
<p>距離着很遠從魚市散發出的一股濃烈的魚腥，愈衡進人的鼻子。　唷！　唷！之聲沒有間斷，挑的背的成羣結隊趕來趕去。空的筐子籃子都　進了黃的魚。窄狹的街道二旁設立了各色各樣的攤子，通道更加窄狹擠篩選人裏足不產。稍有一塊瓦礫堆，或小空塲也不會冷落它的，賣膏藥啦小熱錯啦！……自然還有，變相的財博攤，應時而生。「一本萬利」，「一二三」等等，東一堆西一堆的人牆。要是你想比一個上下，保證拍空袋底。</p>
<p>本地的旅館，商店，刷新裝璜。妓女歌女……也趕來做好賣買。</p>
<p>捕魚人的體魄，健全結實。二隻凸出的眼睛炯炯　射。他們很健談，捕魚的風味常常在他們口裏說出。汛期前些日子，他們到了茫茫的海洋裏。汛期日子黃花魚都浮在海面上，結成龐大的魚羣。唼喋的聲音老遠就可以聽見。領頭的是「魚王」，發見魚羣的捕魚船，讓魚王游過，然後下綱。「魚王」是惹不得的。</p>
<p>捕魚的命運寄托在神佛身上。整船的命運也寄托神佛身上。茫茫一色的水天沒有依靠，沒有連絡，汛期過了，魚就深沉，再也不給人吃了。一年的幸福就靠這一個汛期決定。</p>
<h3>奇異行列</h3>
<p>— 司馬還</p>
<p>馬路上現在時時發現這樣一個行列，前面一面白布三角旗，上書「巡邏隊」三字，以後是海軍陸戰隊，憲兵，警察，警備部的士兵，制服各有不同，顏色也不一致。</p>
<p>這是爲了維持治安的一個糾察隊伍，但有一個缺點，沒有空軍。</p>
<p>依例推演，老百姓中有士農工商，似首也得各推代表一人參加。</p>
<h3>鏡子</h3>
<p>— 變山</p>
<p>在一家小理髮店裏，我忽然看到了自己的一副奇特的臉。我心裏想，在理髮店裏不會有一面哈哈鏡吧！事實上也的確不像哈哈鏡，因爲立在哈哈鏡前面，第一就會使我有一陣頭暈的感覺，這兒　個影響是沒有。而且鏡子中所反映出來的，的確也並不是長的臉或矮胖的身子，這就造成我更疑惑的念頭：我的臉竟是這末出奇的難看嗎？——是的，我並沒有很好看的臉蛋，但我很知道我的五官總是端正的。然而這裏所告訴我的，我的臉竟是這末一副怪歪曲的樣子。說有什麼殘缺嗎？倒沒有。但是好像把我的臉浮化了！我的臉決不是這樣子的！</p>
<p>我籎惑，也許到了一個人要理髮的時候是有一番落拓難看的神氣的。但是我看看旁人的臉，看看理髮師等的臉，再望望鏡子；我知道這是一面多麼不誠實的鏡子！</p>
<p>因此到我理完了髮，理髮師再拿了另一面小鏡子放在我的後面着意要叫我看一看鏡子的時候。我立刻就搖了搖手；我何必要再多受一次欺騙呢？</p>
<p>回到家裏，抽履內有一面殘缺的鏡子，我拿出來照了照，我知道這才是我原來的臉。雖然它是這末瘦小，殘破不全，以至不能照到我整個全身，然而這是明朗的正確的鏡子呀！</p>
<p>這面被丟棄在抽屜角裏的可憐的鏡子，今日才開始重獲得主人的愛。它給我一個新的啓示：模糊或歪曲的全貌，不及一部分正確的觀念來得好！因爲後者可以照清了半面再照別個半面；而前者始終是模糊而不正確的。</p>

<h3>法院旁聽證　黑市一千元</h3>
<p>— 武陵人</p>
<p>南京警察廳拘獲君白戲者，以卡車送至湯山道旁，令其步行回城，以示薄懲。湯山距離南京三十里，徒步　八小時始達，辦法是好的；可是原住在湯山的朋友，倒是一個機會，如果要免費搭車回家，不妨先去免費看一段白戲。</p>
<p>首都高院旁聽證已發現黑市，欲得一張旁聽證，須化法幣一千元。因此軍政部兵役處向高院建議旁聽者須憑各機關證章，以免黑市。如果實行此辦法，黑市是可以消滅了，但是否相信，決不會就此減少旁聽的擁擠，因爲證章是不會開口的。</p>
<p>戲劇電影協會爲檢舉附逆份子，特在四川路郵政總局設一專備檢舉的木箱，該會已定六日下午啓箱，對所檢舉者一經查實，當呈請當局嚴急。當然有一部份人對此不免擔憂，我認爲大可不必，好在還有「查實」的一個階段。</p>
<p>勝利後十個月來，本市查獲的毒物和用具，六三節在外灘公園當衆焚燬，中有烟　四塊，烟泡若干包，價值百餘萬元，翡翠烟槍一枝，真牙象者數枝。　君子財此，當大爲鴉片大可移用於醫藥方面，旣非廢物，似更可以利用，付之一炬，未免可惜，所幸僅僅是「四塊」和「若干包」之數而已。</p>

<h3>我的外子</h3>
<p>— 利芬</p>
<p>我家裏，大小一共五個人。外子經商，早出晚歸。二叔步參銀行當出納。行中有俱樂部，叔父時常哼兩名崑曲。聽他唱販馬計的李奇，自己很得得意，又敎我學唱桂枝。外子回來也唱了趙寵。大女兒歡喜吹笛，請敎師指導了兩個月；脚本讓熟，已能上板。學會一　哭監，一趟寫狀。逢到夜膳後，或星期日，大家叙在一起，引吭高歌。有時請姊妹們欣賞，極能引興。好在不耗費金錢，比打牌跳舞高尚得多。</p>
<p>販馬計不能算純粹的崑腔。正式崑腔，都出在綴白裘。詞句講究文采；音調注重四聲。如果有一個字唱得不對，就認爲大錯。糾正音律，敎師特別注重；學得真好，須下一番工夫。</p>
<p>不過我自己覺得最難得者外子本來生性急躁，奔走碌碌，態度怱忙，平日對於室家兒女，常抱慍色。自從崑曲娛樂後，由絢料歸到平淡。有時對我說：「從前喜歡打牌，輸的更不必說，贏了錢要請客，再貼一倍。吃酒尋花，甚覺糊塗。況且物價貴，賺錢不易，但能得過且過，精神安樂，於願　足。」所以今年又請了笛師來，專敎「正義和順」之曲。已經學會醉妃·折柳·楊關·喬醋。有一次到松韻別爭孔家開曲會，居然大胆地高歌　一曲，博得衆人拍手。</p>
<p>次兒成　，今年十六，嗓子清這。他喜學唱官生，就拍一餉八陽。起首「大地山河一担裝」他將末一字唱作挑，大家笑起來。他說「一　擔放在肩上，怎麼不要挑起來？」我對他講，這是建文遇難，在路上歡息，不過他年輕，也許在音律上將來能學的很好哩。</p>

<h3>Marshall Envoy Headquarters Announces National-Communist Agreement Imminent; Task Force Assigned and Preparing to Depart for Changchun</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] This evening, local newspapers stated that the government's basic stance on resolving the Northeast issue consists of approximately five points: (1) Adherence to the ceasefire agreement of January 10th as the standard. (2) The troop reorganization plan should be thoroughly implemented, beginning in the Northeast. (3) Concrete measures should be implemented to restore transportation, and guarantees must be provided. (4) Increase Marshall's arbitration power (final decision-making power). (5) Following this negotiation, both sides should earnestly guarantee implementation, and concrete results must be achieved within ten days. The government has no intention of delaying negotiations until after the recovery of Harbin. The evening newspapers also stated: The CCP's basic attitude toward resolving the Northeast issue also includes the following points: (1) While the January 10th ceasefire agreement should be earnestly implemented, the March 27th Northeast ceasefire agreement should also be earnestly implemented (the contents of this agreement are unclear). (2) After the troop reorganization plan is earnestly implemented, the CCP forces should also receive earnest guarantees. (3) The restoration of transportation should be comprehensive, including (a) all forms of transportation beyond railways, such as waterways, post and telegraph; (b) dismantling fortifications along transportation lines; and (c) abolishing transportation inspections. (4) All signed agreements should be guaranteed for earnest implementation. After reading this, individuals in the capital believe that the government's stated attitude (that a concrete result must be achieved within ten days) is sufficient to fully express that there will be no further delays to alleviate the suffering of the people. Regarding the attitude held by the Communist Party, such as the comprehensive restoration of transportation, it is generally believed that this is something the government desires but has been unable to obtain, because the current state of disrepair of waterway, postal, and telegraphic communication in the recovered areas has been caused by the Communist Party. Therefore, it is still hoped that the Communist Party can provide a resolution. From this perspective, the Communist Party is still intentionally delaying the issues of internal conflict and restoring routes, and the situation remains to be clarified.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] This afternoon, Marshall's envoy headquarters announced: a National-Communist agreement is imminent. It also revealed: the headquarters has assigned an advanced executive task force, which is preparing to depart for Changchun, "ready to implement any possible ceasefire agreement." Brigadier General Byroade will serve as the senior American official in the group, which indicates that after a ceasefire agreement is reached in the capital, the Executive Headquarters will assume an extremely important responsibility in its complex and subtle execution.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Tonight, General Zhou Enlai stated: He hopes that a ceasefire agreement can be signed tonight or tomorrow. It was learned from a very reliable source that the ceasefire period will be extended to fifteen days. It was also mentioned that Chairman Chiang agreed to a seven-day ceasefire, while the Communist side insisted on thirty days. After lengthy negotiations, both sides compromised on fifteen days. During this fifteen-day ceasefire period, the Nationalists and Communists will resolve their differences.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Military Three-Person Committee will sign an agreement at noon tomorrow. It will be signed by the three committee members: Marshall, Zhou Enlai, and Xu Yongchang, and will take effect immediately after signing.</p>
<h3>Important Issues Resolved, Three-Person Meeting Can Be Convened Anytime: Minister Peng Answers Foreign Correspondents' Inquiries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Foreign Correspondents' Executive Committee held a meeting at 4:00 PM on the 5th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Nuo. The following is a record of the main questions and answers:</p>
<p>Question: Now that Chairman Chiang has returned to the capital, is it possible that the Three-Person Meeting will reconvene within a few days?</p>
<p>Answer (Minister Peng): Important issues, such as those currently contained in the situation, typically cannot be resolved in formal meetings. Informal consultations have not ceased. If they can be resolved, the Three-Person Meeting can be convened at any time. An agreement had already been reached four months ago, but complications arose during implementation, leading to wasted time and increased suffering for the people. We hope that this agreement must include concrete implementation plans and deadlines to cease conflict, reorganize troops, and restore transportation. These should not be merely principles or slogans. In particular, the restoration of transportation is most urgent. The destruction of railways and highways prevents the circulation of goods, prevents refugees from returning home, and consequently leads to soaring prices and social unrest. The most important thing to save the people from this dire situation is to restore transportation. The government's military actions in the Northeast are truly a last resort. The motive is not to attack the Communist forces, but to restore effective control over Chinese territory. Moreover, the Sino-Soviet Treaty also contains provisions regarding this. The Communist Party's strategy is to delay, but the government cannot allow the situation to be delayed indefinitely because the suffering people are eager for a quick resolution. Given the Communist Party's past behavior, future agreements must be concrete and include deadlines. For example, the restoration of transportation must specify which sections of road must be repaired, and it must specify the repair period so that everyone knows for sure when traffic will resume. We firmly believe in and emphasize the rapid implementation of all agreements and prevent endless disputes over technical or theoretical issues. The most reliable way to prevent wasting time is to strengthen the arbitration power and responsibility of the American representative. Accepting this kind of arbitration is the best expression of sincerity and the best prevention against delays. If the Communist side has a better solution, the government is also willing to consider it. If the Communist Party can agree to earnestly establish and abide by this plan, then the Chairman can issue an order to cease all military action nationwide. Regarding the news of the East Mongolian Autonomous Government, Minister Peng stated that it is not confirmed.</p>
<h3>Nanjing City Actively Preparing to Receive Demobilized Youth Army Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Nanjing Youth Army Demobilization Committee stated that approximately 5,800 Youth Army soldiers demobilized from areas near Hangzhou, Wuhu, and Anqing will pass through Nanjing in three batches on the 14th, 15th, and 16th of this month. In addition to the Comfort Team already actively raising comfort supplies to show their condolences, a plenary meeting was also held. The following tasks were decided: (1) Arrange for the Youth Army camp. (2) Affix banners and slogans, publish special editions, and conduct comfort activities such as citizen greetings, greetings from heads of organizations, gifting of comfort supplies, and entertainment for guests. (3) Handle supplies such as food, water, transportation, sanitation, and entertainment. (4) Handle services such as stabilizing prices, answering questions, and guiding tours. (5) Conduct investigations into interests, registration, introductions to transfers to schools or jobs, and provide supplementary education. (6) Launch social activities. (7) Communicate and liaise. It is also understood that the association will also establish a service center in Xiaguan to handle reception work. At that time, it is planned to select 200 students from various schools each day to undertake reception duties. As for the accommodation for the Youth Army soldiers arriving in the capital, it is tentatively planned to temporarily use the coal port of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. in Xiaguan.</p>
<h3>Central Government Allocates 1 Billion Yuan to Relief Efforts for Northern Jiangsu Refugees</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 5th] The central government's efforts to provide relief to Northern Jiangsu refugees have gradually entered the concrete stage. Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs, who is fully responsible for overseeing the relief work for Northern Jiangsu refugees, telegraphed Chairman Wang Maogong of Jiangsu Province on the morning of the 5th, stating that the central government has agreed to allocate the first 1 billion yuan of the 2 billion yuan in special funds requested by Jiangsu Province for refugee relief. Relief supplies have been arranged through the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, with a large quantity of medical supplies allocated by the Ministry of Health. He also instructed Wang to quickly and thoroughly investigate the number of refugees to prepare for long-term relief measures. After receiving the telegram, Wang convened representatives of the relief associations from various counties in Northern Jiangsu at 3:00 PM to discuss all matters related to the implementation. Minister Gu is scheduled to come to Zhenjiang within days to personally preside over the work and establish an office in Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3>Eradication of Opium in the Ya'an-Pingbian Area of Sichuan Province Concluded</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 4th] Liu Ren'an, the administrative commissioner of the 5th Administrative District of Sichuan Province, recently personally led the security team, along with the local garrison force of the division headquarters, deep into the Ya'an-Pingbian area to forcibly eradicate opium. After a month of intense fighting with the local indigenous opium farmers, it has now come to an end. Liu went to Chengdu yesterday to report the process to the provincial government and the pacification headquarters. According to him, a total of 500,000 acres of opium were eradicated this time. With each acre producing 50 taels of opium, the amount is truly astonishing. All eighteen reclamation farms where opium was planted, except for two that were retained to resettle law-abiding citizens, have been abolished. New Baojia units have been established to plan for the aftermath. Liu also has a plan for governing the border area, stating that future work in the border area should focus on prohibition of opium, indigenous affairs, and transportation, advancing in parallel.</p>
<h3>Central Women's Movement Committee Executes Work Among Beijing Women's Circles</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Central Women's Movement Committee held a tea party at the Central Party Headquarters at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, inviting women from the capital. Over eighty people attended. Liu Hengjing, the chairman of the committee, presided over the meeting, and the discussions were very enthusiastic. Earnest studies were done regarding issues such as strengthening the ties between women's organizations, eliminating illiteracy among women, organizing savings for disaster relief, child welfare, post-war marital disputes, and assisting families of soldiers.</p>
<h3>Chairman Sends Condolences for Kalinin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Mikhail Kalinin, the former Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, passed away on the 3rd. Chairman Chiang was deeply saddened upon hearing the news and sent a telegram of condolence on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Nanjing to Erect a Bronze Statue of Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>In Commemoration of Leadership and Contributions to the War of Resistance</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Nanjing municipal authorities plan to demolish the tower built by the enemy and puppet regime in Drum Tower Square and erect a bronze statue of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in that location to commemorate his leadership in the War of Resistance, which ultimately led to the surrender of the Japanese invaders and achieved final victory.</p>
<h3>Plan to Adjust Civil Servants' Salaries to be Implemented After Chairman's Approval; National Defense Committee Approves Sino-Danish Treaty</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The National Defense Committee's routine meeting on the 5th did not discuss the issue of adjusting civil servants' salaries. It is said that at the previous meeting, the committee had decided to authorize the Executive Yuan to organize the measures proposed by the Executive Yuan and the measures proposed by Committee Member Chen Lifu, which would increase salaries based on the cost of living index, etc., and submit them to Chairman Chiang for final approval. Therefore, it is not planned to have the committee discuss and approve this case again. It is understood that the two plans organized by the Executive Yuan have been submitted to the Chairman and should be decided and implemented in the near future.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Supreme National Defense Council held a meeting on the morning of the 5th, personally presiding over it. Attendees included Zou Lu, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, He Yingqin, Song Ziwen, Bai Chongxi, Chen Guofu, Wang Chonghui, Chen Yi, Shao Lizi, Wu Dingchang, Wang Shijie, Jiang Menglin, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Lisheng, Li Wenfan, Chen Lifu, Liang Hancao, and over forty others. The following major resolutions were passed: (1) The Sino-Danish Treaty was approved and submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. (2) The resolutions and recommendations of the Fourth National Political Council, Second Session, were distributed to the relevant authorities for handling. (3) The key points for the management of housing rentals and purchases in Nanjing were approved.</p>
<h3>An Authoritative Source Meets with Reporters to Discuss the Key to Resolving the Overall Situation; Wu Tiecheng Speaks of the Kuomintang's Eagerness for Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] According to an authoritative source who told our reporter: Today, a small number of newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai revealed the details of the talks between Marshall's envoy and Chairman Chiang and Zhou Enlai yesterday regarding the ceasefire and restoration of transportation. It was stated that Chairman Chiang had agreed to a seven-day cessation of military operations to facilitate negotiations, which was then mediated by Marshall and finalized at ten days. It was also stated that when Marshall continued to meet with Zhou Enlai yesterday afternoon, Zhou felt that the ten-day period was still too short, and the talks did not reach a conclusion. From the above, it can be seen that the CCP still lacks sincerity regarding the ceasefire issue. Because the key to resolving the overall situation today lies not in the length of the ceasefire period or the scope of the ceasefire, but in whether the CCP can abandon its martial concept of seizing power by force, whether it can automatically correct its decadent, backward, anti-democratic, and expansionist feudal ideology, and whether it can abandon its erroneous views of taking advantage of opportunities to carve out territories, avoid troop reorganization, and preserve its strength. If the CCP truly believes that its own inferiority complex and cruelty to the people have placed the Chinese nation in an irrecoverable situation, it should turn over a new leaf, automatically apologize to the people, accept Marshall's goodwill, abide by the January 10th ceasefire agreement and troop reorganization plan, and cease all its reckless actions inside and outside the Guanzhong region that obstruct the government from taking over sovereignty, destroying roads, destroying mines, harming the country, and harming the people. By honoring the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and submitting a list of National Assembly representatives and personnel participating in government work in order to promptly reorganize the government and jointly shoulder the heavenly responsibility of saving and building the country with the Kuomintang, it still has a bright future. If it persists in its errors, even if the government can endure and tolerate it again and again, I fear that the people's anger will be too great and difficult to quell, and the people will automatically rise up in a great campaign of condemnation.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Today, a government official close to Chairman Chiang in the peace talks stated that a Nationalist-Communist ceasefire agreement is expected to be signed today or tomorrow, but it depends on whether the Communist side agrees to the government's proposal that General Marshall be the supreme arbitrator of the agreement. The official declared that if the Communist side rejects this proposal, the Chairman has decided not to negotiate further. He said: General Zhou Enlai strongly opposes several key points within the proposal. His opposition is the only reason why the ceasefire order has been delayed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng met with a United Press reporter on the 4th and discussed the views recently expressed by Luo Longji, a representative of the Democratic League. Wu solemnly stated that the Kuomintang's desire for peace is no less than that of any faction. Luo's statement that the United States is promoting fascism in China is laughable. This is truly an insult to the great ally that advocates democracy. Luo should know that the mission of the US military in China is only to assist our country in taking over sovereignty in the Northeast and sending Japanese prisoners of war back to their country. However, he made such confusing remarks, which is very regrettable. Wu continued: All of our countrymen understand the nobility of the United States' mission in China and the correctness of its tasks. Also, when the National Army in Changchun was under attack, Luo did not publicly dissuade the Communist army from attacking. Only after the National Army approached Sipingjie, Gongzhuling, and Inner Mongolia did he advocate a ceasefire. After the National Army recovered Changchun, he wanted to prevent the National Army from advancing towards Harbin and Qiqihar. In short, Luo's remarks do not seem to come from the mouth of a neutral party. It is feared that peace will be difficult to achieve if he appeals for peace with this attitude. It is no wonder that outsiders refer to him as a voluntary spokesperson for the CCP. Wu finally stated: The success or failure of future negotiations depends entirely on whether the Communist Party ceases attacking the National Army in the Northeast and whether it will abandon its delaying tactics of negotiating and not resolving issues with the Kuomintang.</p>
<h3>General Commander Chen Reports at the National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>(3) Sending Enemy Prisoners Back to Their Country: The total number of Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese residents within China (excluding Northeast China, including Northern Vietnam) is over 1.9 million. On October 25th of last year, a joint Sino-US meeting was convened in Shanghai to determine the plan for sending them back to their country. US Navy landing craft and requisitioned Japanese ships would be used for transportation, and eleven ports would be used: Tanggu, Guangzhou, Haikou, Shantou, Xiamen, Haiphong, Keelung, and Kaohsiung. The General Logistics Headquarters is responsible for handling Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese residents in the interior.</p>
<p>The inspection and command of Japanese prisoners of war and residents when boarding ships, as well as other related matters. Japanese prisoners of war and residents who are being repatriated are allowed to carry 1,000 Japanese yen for civilians, 500 yen for officers, and 200 yen for soldiers, as well as their clothing and personal belongings. If they exceed this amount or have prohibited items, they will be confiscated by the Chinese government and kept as part of the war reparations in the future. All prisoners of war and residents from various locations are required to be completely repatriated by the end of June. As of the end of May, it is estimated that over 1.6 million people have been repatriated.</p>
<p>(4) Collection and Handling of Enemy and Puppet Military Supplies: The country is divided into ten collection zones (Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, Jinan, Vietnam, Guangzhou, Kaifeng, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), and a special commissioner is assigned to each zone to handle the matter. Each zone completed the takeover by the end of March of this year, and three acceptance committees were separately dispatched to conduct acceptance inspections in each zone, which is still in progress. As for the use of enemy and puppet military supplies, plans have been formulated and are being implemented step by step. Those of a supply nature, such as grain, ammunition, and fuel, are used to supply troops nearby according to regulations. Those of a supplementary nature, such as weapons, clothing, and various equipment, are allocated to supplement the needs of the troops. Those of an enrichment allocation nature, such as tanks, vehicles, and horses, are used to enrich the troops. For raw materials in military factories, the factories are started up in advance to engage in production, and the raw materials are uniformly cast, allocated, and utilized. (Continued from yesterday)</p>
<h3>Nanjing Freedom Protection Association Holds Plenary Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Since its establishment, the Nanjing People's Freedom Protection Committee has received many cases from citizens requesting protection. The association has scheduled a plenary meeting for the 6th to discuss how to handle each case and refer them to the relevant agencies for review in order to protect the people's freedom.</p>
<h3>Two Chinese Armies Meet in Huadian and Advance Towards Andong Province; Main Force of Communist Army Concentrating on Sino-Korean Border</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] After the official Changchun National Army's left wing moved towards Yongji, it advanced to Lafa, which has the Lanbin Railway and is extremely important as it connects to Harbin in the northwest. The central route has crossed the Songhua River and arrived near Shuangdabei Mountain. Today's Xinmin Daily reports that the National Army had entered Harbin at noon on the 3rd and was advancing towards Liu Liu Haar, but this news has been denied by the official authorities here. The National Army's left wing is currently stalled on the front line of Nong'an, and the National Army south of Changchun is using Sipingjie as its center to clear the surrounding transportation lines. The western route has extended to Liaoyuan, and after conquering Huadian, the eastern route is turning south and advancing towards Andong Province. In the central and southern regions, the situation is quite chaotic. After Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Yingkou fell, the sound of artillery can be heard in Liaoyang.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] According to official sources, the main force of the Communist Army in the Northeast is concentrating in the mountainous area of Andong on the Sino-Korean border, intending to hold the area for a long time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 4th] The National Army moving south met with the National Army moving north from Hailong in Huadian on the 3rd. After the National Army occupied Huadian, the protection of traffic on the Jihai Road (Jilin to Hailong) is of great value. The National Army advancing towards Lafa Station is advancing eastward.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department declared on the 5th: The Communist Party's claim that Anshan and Yingkou have been occupied by Communist forces is completely inaccurate. Yingkou has always been in the hands of the government army. Anshan was briefly lost but was quickly recovered within five days (May 31st). The 184th Division is still guarding Anshan.</p>
<h3>Revised Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Conference Scheduled to Open Today in Nanjing; Yu Hongjun Convened Meeting of Provincial Finance Directors Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The meeting on implementing the revised fiscal revenue and expenditure system, convened by the Ministries of Finance and Food, is scheduled to open at 9:00 AM on the 6th at the Lizhi Society. A total of 55 proposals have been received, and 85 members had registered by this evening. It is not yet known whether Premier Song will attend, but Premier Song will host all members at the Lizhi Society at 5:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. Also, Minister of Finance Yu of the Ministry of Finance convened a meeting of the finance directors of various provinces who came to the capital to attend the meeting at the Ministry of Finance at 3:00 PM this afternoon. After the attendees reported on their work, Minister Yu gave many instructions, and the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] Luo Zhuoying, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, received reporters yesterday, the 3rd, and reported on four tasks: food, security, transportation, and relief. Chairman Luo said regarding the food problem: The period of food shortages in Guangdong has not yet passed. The counties suffered severe droughts a month ago, and the food shortage was serious.

<h3>Prelude to Execution of Traitor Chu Minyi: A Visit to the Suzhou Third Prison</h3>
<p>— Our Suzhou Quick Report, 5th Wu Shouren</p>
<p>After the High Court issued the ruling upholding the original sentence of traitor Chu Minyi, it was widely rumored in the area that the execution would take place on the morning of the 5th. Around 7:00 a.m., about twenty reporters from various newspapers, including those stationed in Suzhou from other cities, gathered at the Third Prison at Shizikou, eager to witness the state of this last remaining major traitor before his execution. Warden Chen Songnian was immediately surrounded by reporters, who pressed him to confirm the news. Chen expressed surprise and firmly denied having any prior knowledge of the execution. The reporters, looking anxious, waited outside the prison for three hours without anyone leaving, while the execution order for Chu Minyi was correspondingly delayed in the Ministry of Justice or the Jiangsu High Court. Therefore, the reporters collectively requested Warden Chen to allow them to tour the inside of the prison. This was originally strictly forbidden by the judicial authorities in the midst of the crackdown on traitors, but Chen reluctantly agreed to the request due to popular demand. However, he laid down three rules: (1) Reporters must remove their press badges during the tour and must not talk or laugh loudly. (2) They must not converse with the prisoners. (3) They must surrender their cameras when visiting the Li and Women's Prisons to prevent the surreptitious photographing of Chen and Chu. All agreed. Under the guidance of Chen, the guard chief Ye Ruiting, and the security chief Yao Qiwen, they entered the prison, which was divided into six sections: Li (rites), Yi (righteousness), Lian (integrity), Chi (shame), the Sick Ward, and the Women's Prison. There were also solitary confinement cells to punish prisoners who violated the rules, a lecture hall for daily ideological training of the prisoners, and a medical room for treating sick prisoners, with Dr. Wu Baogu as the attending physician and Miss Shen Xinnan as the pharmacist. The first section visited was the Yi Prison, with eighteen cells holding about 150 prisoners, all accused of being traitors awaiting review or final judgment. The reporters took a quick look and saw various kinds of traitors, large and small, mostly lying down and reading novels. Their beds were all small two-tiered iron beds. They then moved to the adjacent First Workshop, where sixty-seven prisoners were engaged in making toothbrushes, straw sandals, and clothing. According to Chen, a printing workshop was also being prepared. They then went to the Lian Prison, which had twelve cells and held more than five hundred ordinary criminal offenders, all of whom were working in the workshops. Climbing the stairs, they reached the Chi Prison, which also had twelve cells, but was currently empty. The executed traitor Miao Bin had been imprisoned in cell number twelve during his lifetime. Leaving the Chi Prison, they were led to the newly built washrooms and storage rooms, and then to the Sick Ward. The first thing that caught the reporters' attention was the exquisitely clean medical office. The pharmacist, Miss Shen, was at her desk recording medications. The photographers with cameras scrambled to find suitable angles to take pictures. The Sick Ward had twelve cells and housed more than ten sick prisoners. According to Chen, the current mortality rate among the prisoners was extremely low, but the source of medications was difficult and he hoped that enthusiastic people in society would donate and that charitable organizations would pay attention to this. Finally, they arrived in front of the Li Prison, where the reporters' interest suddenly increased, especially the photographers who were eager to try out their cameras. Chen reiterated his warning, but after repeated requests, he agreed to allow them to photograph the exterior, with them squatting or leaning down, vying to capture the best angle. After about a quarter of an hour, they regretfully put away their cameras. At the first and second cells in front of the responsible officer's prison, they peeked through the small window and saw traitor Chu Minyi reclining against the corner of the right wall, reading a book. He was wearing a yellowish-brown short gown and trousers, with light blue socks and short hair about three or four inches long. His face was pale and frightening. Next to his bed was a small half-table, with a white paper covering the surface, and a complete set of inkstone and writing brush, as well as a small mirror and several books. Qian Yu, the former Chief Prosecutor of the puppet Anhui High Court, and Zheng Bin, the Director of the puppet Taixian Consolidated Tax Bureau, were also imprisoned in the same cell. Cell number one, where the major traitor Chen Gongbo had been imprisoned, was now empty, with only two empty iron beds remaining inside. The Li Prison had a total of thirteen cells, and those imprisoned were all once prominent major traitors, including Chen Zemin, the puppet governor of Jiangsu Province, Chen Fumin, the puppet president of the Jiangsu High Court, and Chen Zhanru, the last puppet county magistrate of Wuxian, father, son, uncle, and nephew all imprisoned together in cell number ten. After about twenty minutes of viewing, they withdrew. Arriving at the Women's Prison, which was connected by a corridor, there were two cells, one large and one small. The large cell housed more than ten female criminal offenders, and the small cell was the solitary residence of Chen Bijun, the traitor. The furnishings were quite neat, with a circular wicker chair, a table with drawers, and other daily necessities, all complete. The cell was unlocked, which was a unique phenomenon in the entire prison. The reporters saw this once red-hot female traitor of the "public residence" faction lying on a rattan couch reading a book, wearing a light gray cloth shirt. She never looked back at the twenty or so uninvited guests. According to the guards, Chen had a volatile temper and would scold at the slightest dissatisfaction, and it was necessary to address her as "Madame Wang" for her to respond, another sign of the traitor's last desperate tricks.</p>
<p>After the prison tour, they were led by Chen to visit the bathroom and kitchen. They were informed that the current standard of food for the prisoners was twenty ounces of rice and four ounces of vegetables per person per day. Collective exercise was permitted for thirty minutes each at 9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Haircuts were given every fifteen days and bathing every ten days. During the two hours of the tour, the reporters had a deep impression, which can be summed up in the four words: neat and clean. It is said that the Third Prison was known as a model prison even before the war. Today, it is even more in line with modern requirements. It is now known that the prison's personnel organization consists of the warden, followed by three sections, each with a section chief, a head guard, and a security chief, followed by a dozen or so guards. There are also accounting, personnel, and military training instructors, medical clinics, and educational offices, each responsible for their respective tasks. Around 12:00 noon, the reporters still had not seen any sign of the execution, so they took a group photo with the warden and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Capital Police Department Issues Order Prohibiting the Sale of Heretical Books by Traitors</h3>
<p>(This newspaper, Nanjing, 5th) The Capital Police Department recently issued an order to all its bureaus, strictly prohibiting the sale of traitor autobiographies and prison diaries in the city. Anyone who violates this order will be punished according to law. This matter was suggested to the relevant authorities by our newspaper's president, Pan Gongzhan, during his previous visit to Nanjing. This matter has now attracted the attention of all parties, who agree that it should be strictly prohibited in order to curb heresy.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Plans to Convene Meeting to Discuss Solutions to the Economic Crisis, Shanghai to Hold Separate Production Meeting</h3>
<p>(This newspaper, Nanjing, 5th) In order to alleviate the current economic crisis, the Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to convene an economic conference in the near future, inviting well-known figures from the industrial and commercial sectors and experts and scholars. Shanghai will hold a separate production meeting, inviting representatives from various factories to participate and discuss ways to promote production and resolve labor disputes. Regarding the foreign exchange issue, Vice Minister Pan Xulun said that the Ministry does not advocate changing the exchange rate, which would affect prices, as raising the exchange rate would cause complaints from merchants, while lowering the exchange rate would lead to the closure of factories. Therefore, it is advocated that the import tariff rate be revised to solve the difficulties in foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Major Traitors in North China, Including Wang Yintai, Will Soon Be Indicted, Wife of Traitor Chu Minyi Requests Retrial Again</h3>
<p>(This newspaper, Suzhou, 5th) Traitor Chu Minyi has been sentenced to death, and although the Supreme Court has approved the retrial and the ruling has been delivered, his wife, Chu Chen Shunzhen, has expressed her dissatisfaction. At about 11:00 a.m. on the 5th, she submitted a document to the Jiangsu High Court requesting another retrial. The news has caused widespread consternation in all circles, as according to the Special Criminal Procedure Law, no objections can be raised to criminal liabilities ruled by the three-trial court. Even if the extraordinary appeal regulations were used, they could not be utilized by direct relatives but only by the prosecuting attorney or the chief prosecutor of the three-trial court. In order to understand the Jiangsu High Court's attitude towards the case, the reporter specially requested to see President Sun, but he was attending a provincial government meeting in Zhenjiang and was not available. The request will be left to Sun to decide how to handle after returning to Suzhou. However, according to opinions obtained by the reporter from all aspects of the judicial community, it is believed that the possibility of rejection and non-acceptance is greater.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th) Wang Yintai and fourteen other major traitors who were escorted from Beiping to Nanjing are currently being interrogated separately by the military and the Capital High Court. They will soon be indicted one after another, and a public trial will be held before the 700,000 citizens of the capital.

<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Various Circumstances Before and After the Execution of Traitor Chen</p>
<p>Major traitor Chen Gongbo, along with traitor Chen Bijun, and traitor Chu Minyi, were escorted from Nanjing to the Jiangsu High Court on February 17th. On June 2nd, they were transferred to the Third Prison, and on the morning of the 3rd, Chen Gongbo was executed, totaling one hundred and five days. When traitor Chen was brought to court for interrogation, after the prosecutor carried out the execution, he requested to return to the prison cell to change clothes, wearing shoes and socks and a blue cloth long gown. He then said goodbye to traitor Chen Bijun and traitor Chu Minyi. At that time, traitor Chen's face had changed, but he still pretended to be arrogant. After the sound of gunfire, traitor Chu silently sat cross-legged in the prison cell, frequently reciting Buddhist scriptures in a hoarse and trembling voice, with his hands clasped together and his eyes closed. Traitor Chen Bijun initially cried after the farewell, but after the sound of gunfire, she burst into tears, speaking entirely in Cantonese, crying, "Mr. Wang" has harmed you. My crime is greater than yours (referring to traitor Chen Gongbo), why not sentence me to death? I would rather die together, etc. Later, the female guards ordered her to stop. After the major traitor was executed, the corpse was placed on a wooden board (approximately four feet wide and two and a half feet long), and blood flowed like a torrent. Even in the afternoon, blood continued to seep from the bullet wounds. The face was purplish-white. The corpse was moved from the prison, and the peace was restored. His son, Chen Gan, came to Suzhou on the 4th to purchase a coffin and collect the body. On the day of traitor Chen's execution, his daughter-in-law, Mo Guokang, was publicly tried in Nanjing. It is heard that the execution order for traitor Chu Minyi will also arrive at the High Procuratorate in the near future. Recently, a relative, "the owner of the Caizhi Zhai candied fruit shop," Mr. Jin, hurried to make a shroud for traitor Chu, and specially prepared a genuine "Wuyuan" coffin and a certain cemetery for the burial of traitor Chu.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Resolutions of the Food Conference on Important Cases</p>

<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Police Trouble Case Resolved</p>
<p>The traffic police of Xinan Town in the southern countryside of this county, treating the people as enemies and abusing their power of arrest, used torture, which caused a town-wide shop strike. Representatives were elected to petition various agencies. It is learned that Magistrate Xu sent Li, the military section chief, to the countryside on the 3rd, leading a team to investigate the truth, and all traffic police squad leaders and policemen were detained and transferred to the First Pacification District Headquarters for strict handling according to law.

<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>True Cholera Discovered in the City</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been unstable and epidemics are rampant. A few days ago, tiger plague was discovered in the eastern suburbs, with three deaths in one village. It has now spread to the city. On the night of the 2nd, the daughter of Han Azeng, a resident of Lujiayuan in Chunhui Town, Ah Xiu, only seven years old, suddenly vomited and had diarrhea. She died on the morning of the 3rd. Ah Xiu's grandmother and aunt were both infected. It was only in the afternoon that a doctor was called for treatment, who diagnosed it as true cholera. Cheng's health facilities are lacking, and there is no complete hospital. The spread of the epidemic is worrying. Even preventive needles and medicines are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Hefei</p>
<p>Start Inspecting Innovation Efficiency</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly assess the efficiency of the innovation movement and determine rewards and punishments, Chairman Li stipulated that from the 31st to June 6th, the heads of the Party, government, military, police, and educational institutions should appoint senior personnel to inspect the provincial capital and all institutions in Hefei County in groups. It has been previously reported that on the 31st, three groups inspected the provincial capital and six groups inspected the county simultaneously. The targets of the work were (1) implementation of laws and regulations, (2) work efficiency, (3) punctuality, (4) morning meetings, (5) cleanliness, (6) thrift. On the first day, the provincial group inspected the Secretariat, the four departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction, the five offices of Society, Accounting, Health, and Water Conservancy Engineering, and the Provincial Social Service and other five offices, as well as the Provincial Library and various primary and secondary schools. The group inspected the Security and Military Control District Headquarters and other places on the first day. The county groups went to Shushan, Guanting, Sanhe, Wangzicheng, Buli, Changlinhe, and other six districts to inspect. Before leaving, Chairman Li instructed that if any cases of corruption, fraud, or illegal activity were found, they must be reported immediately for strict handling.</p>
<h3>Developing Southwest Economic Industry, Design of the Eastern Sichuan Power Grid Completed, 17 Large and Small Power Plants to Be Constructed</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th) In order to develop the southwest economic industry, the National Hydropower Engineering Office of the Resources Committee has recently formulated a plan to weave the eastern Sichuan power grid. This plan, following the great projects of the Grand Coulee Dam in the United States, the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station in the Soviet Union, and the Yangtze River Hydropower Plan in China, is another great and amazing plan, and has now begun to be implemented. The Jialing River near Chongqing, the Longxi River near Changshou, the Dadu River, Qingjiang, and the Min River near Chengdu are rich in water resources and have steep riverbeds, all of which have value to be developed and utilized urgently. In addition to the Dujiangyan Power Plant on the Min River, which is already in the planning stage and will begin construction in the near future, and the power generation plans for the Huodu River and Qingyi River, which are incorporated into the western Sichuan power generation plan, the Longxi River Hydropower Plant in Changshou is the hub of the eastern Sichuan power grid. If the eastern Sichuan power grid can be successfully woven, there can be a total of fifteen large and small hydropower plants and two thermal power plants, with high-voltage transmission lines connecting all plants. The total power generation will not be less than 300,000 kilowatts, which is more than enough to supply the industry and daily electricity needs of various places in eastern Sichuan.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Engineer's Day After Victory</h3>
<p>Today marks the first Engineer's Day after victory, and the sixth Engineer's Day since its inception. Engineer's Day was decided upon during the annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers in Chengdu in the 29th year of the Republic (1940), and a grand celebration was first held in the wartime capital in the 30th year of the Republic (1941) on June 6th. June 6th was originally the birthday of Yu the Great. We take the date commemorating this historical figure who tirelessly controlled floods and saved the people, a paragon of the people, as Engineer's Day, demonstrating the profound self-encouragement of engineers and the ardent hope of the general public for them.</p>
<p>Today, in Shanghai, a leading industrial city in China, and a city that should redouble its efforts in industrial construction after victory, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers holds a commemoration for Engineer's Day, filled with indescribable excitement. However, what greets this first Engineer's Day after the victory of the War of Resistance is not newly smoking chimneys, not the construction of great projects, but the streets of the city filled with foreign goods, such as "glass wallets" and "nylon stockings." What a mockery this is to Engineer's Day, what heartbreak! Since China has had modern engineers, the period cannot be considered too short, but facing the national economic crisis of engineers, its severity is even greater than today. The formation of this situation is not the responsibility of the engineers themselves, but because of the decline of this situation, engineers have been unable to contribute much, and we can only feel ashamed, only hate!</p>
<p>What do we want for Engineer's Day? Whether it's a celebration or a commemoration, the first thing is to enable our existing engineers to do their best for the country and the nation in their respective positions, and to have more work opportunities and places. That is to say, we must quickly restore the factories that have stopped work, implement our national industrial plan as soon as possible, build projects, and establish factories extensively. However, under the current "comprador policy," which only knows to encourage everyone to compete in selling foreign goods and stifle domestic products, not only can we not expect the factories that have stopped work to resume work, but even the factories that are currently smoking will shut down. As for the extensive establishment of factories and the construction of projects, it will be like a fool's dream. Faced with the arrival of Engineer's Day, we must once again, without avoiding annoyance, reiterate that we should quickly change the current economic policy filled with "comprador" thinking.</p>
<p>The protection of our national industry, which is not yet solid, cannot be delayed any longer! The National Government has long decided on the principles of the first phase of economic construction after the war: state-owned and private industrial enterprises will be planned and taken care of concurrently, and private capital will be concentrated and foreign investment will be absorbed through dual channels. But what is happening now? The import of cheap foreign goods not only threatens the survival of national industries, but also dries up the lifeblood of our national economy. In the future, even if we want to invest, we will feel that there is no capital to invest. We should quickly stop this trend of blood flowing outwards. Everyone attributes the reason for rising prices to the rampant speculative capital, but with these weak capitals of the Chinese people, and at a time when industry is almost without foundation, there will be "speculative capital" in the market. This fault cannot be borne by those who hold capital, but should be investigated for the reasons why they are not allowed to invest in industry, such as the difficulties encountered by private industrial enterprises? How is it suppressed? What rewards and encouragement does the government give? Only when the foundation of our national industry is gradually solid can our engineers not worry about not having a place to use their talents. We value the state-owned large-scale industries, and we agree with the state-owned heavy industries, but at the same time, we cannot fail to encourage the private operation of general light industries, that is, industries of daily necessities for the people.</p>
<p>Today, when we celebrate Engineer's Day, we must not forget those engineers who are unemployed or have changed careers. China's industrialization is fifty years behind others. We must catch up. The creation of an engineer cannot be achieved in a short period of time. In the future, our nation-building will require a large number of engineering talents. Chairman Chiang has already mentioned this in his book "China's Destiny." For this need, we certainly need to cultivate new talents to shoulder this new mission, but in the past thirty years, the number of modern engineering talents created in our country must be considerable, but after graduation, they often have no way to go, or the working environment is not good, and they turn to other industries. This is a waste for the individual and an irreparable loss for the country. And there seem to be quite a few who are depressed and frustrated, struggling with poverty, illness, hunger, and money. We must cherish these talents for the country. Otherwise, while we celebrate Engineer's Day and say some good words to embellish the occasion, there are truly overlooked engineers who are not paid attention to, which is a bit unreasonable!</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 4th dispatch] The House of Commons began a two-day debate on foreign policy today. Foreign Secretary Bevin announced Britain's foreign policy in a long article of 9,000 words. According to the draft: (Our newspaper received the broadcast yesterday and has published the main points) The Soviet Union should accept the proposal of U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes to conclude a four-nation convention to monitor Germany's disarmament for a period of twenty-five years. I dare to tell the Soviet Union now that if you value peace above all else, you should not miss this opportunity, lest time never comes again. I think that if the four-nation convention can be implemented faithfully and diligently, it can create a situation where the security will be far greater than supporting a small number of vassal states as a buffer against aggression. At the Paris Conference on June 17, if the four foreign ministers fail to reach an agreement on the peace, I will strongly advocate submitting the peace treaty issue to a full peace conference of all relevant countries. The situation has reached an intolerable point, and we will have to declare to the twenty-one countries that actively participated in the war that because the four foreign ministers cannot agree, the countries will be in a state of war forever. Although Byrnes' plan was rejected by the Soviet Union, the United States should not be afraid. At least there are other countries in Europe that not only welcome this proposal, but also believe that it can give people the greatest hope for resolving misunderstandings and restoring trust.</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>The request for the Saar region cannot be hastily abandoned until after studying the entire issue of the German border. However, the British government, in the final solution, definitely supports the transfer of the Saar to France in addition to the issues of reparations and other factories, etc., but would rather consider the entire German issue before taking the final step.</p>
<p>Soviet Union</p>
<p>The declaration that if the United States and Britain withdraw their troops from Italy, the Italian government can seek compensation from the Soviet Union is something I cannot agree to. I also oppose the Soviet Union's request to cede Trieste to Yugoslavia. I am convinced that nothing could give us greater confidence in peace at the next Paris Conference than the Soviet Union's preparation and willingness to resolve the issues of Austria, Italy, and the Danube River basin together. In the Middle East, both the Soviet Union and the United States recognize that maintaining Britain's position in the Middle East is of great importance to world peace, but ultimately a regional organization suitable for the UN security system should be developed.</p>
<p>Regarding</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, I dare to speak on behalf of the workers of Britain and its dominions. I do not believe that the Soviet system can represent the interests of workers, just like the democratic parliamentary system of Britain. However, there are many issues related to the Soviet Union's attitude towards Britain, which can at least show a kind of realistic thinking. The basic goal of the British government is to enable the League of Nations to carry out effective work.</p>
<p>Danube</p>
<p>The issues of navigation rights on the river and sovereignty over Trieste were major obstacles to peace at the recent Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. I cannot represent the government in making concessions on these important Central European issues. The Soviet Union's proposed border line between Italy and Yugoslavia, including Trieste, would leave no Slavic-speaking people in Italy, while Yugoslavia would have more than 500,000 Italians. On this issue, only the United States and Britain have attempted to propose a compromise, while the Soviet Union has taken no action. I cannot cede Trieste to Yugoslavia. Trieste must be an international port, not a gambling tool in international politics.</p>
<p>Britain</p>
<p>Tried to conclude commercial agreements with Romania, Hungary, and other countries, and was met with obstacles everywhere. Britain will not allow its representatives to take any action that would hinder the Soviet Union's legitimate relations with these countries, but please the Soviet Union reciprocate in the same way. Regarding the Dardanelles Strait, I am not aware of any fundamental dispute. The Montreux Convention allows Turkey to reorganize the military equipment of the strait. Britain is willing to consider amending it, but Britain is eager to avoid any way that would harm Turkey's true independence or turn it into a vassal state.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Scheduled to Go to France, Foreign Ministers' Conference Not Postponed, Soviet Union Insists on its Own Views on Danube River Navigation Issues</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Agency, Washington, 4th dispatch] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes declared at a press conference today that he is scheduled to depart for Paris on June 13 to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The people accompanying him are the same as those who accompanied him to Paris last time, including Senators Connally and Vandenberg. In answering reporters' questions, Mr. Byrnes believed that there was no reason to postpone the Paris Conference scheduled for June 15.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 4th dispatch] The representatives of the four foreign ministers recently continued to meet to discuss the issue of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Bulgaria, but failed to reach an agreement. Soviet representative Gusev said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had requested that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Bulgaria should be carried out at the same time as the withdrawal of Allied troops from Italy. Regarding the issue of navigation on the Danube River, the Soviet representative insisted on his own views, saying that only the coastal countries could participate. This was consistent with the attitude adopted by Foreign Minister Molotov at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, but the representatives had closer opinions on the plan to establish a Danube River Navigation Commission.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th dispatch, United Press] Byrnes declared at a press conference that he had submitted the draft peace treaty with Austria to the Soviet Union, France, and Britain so that they could study it before the next Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<h3>UN Social and Economic Committee, Our Representative Zhang Pengchun Proposes to Improve World Living Standards</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, New York, 4th dispatch] When the UN Economic and Social Council held a plenary meeting today, Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun proposed to establish small committees in each region where the standard of living has not reached the ordinary standard to be responsible for designing several methods to reduce the results of the instability caused by non-industrialized areas in the world. The significance of these regions supplying industrialized countries with a large number of raw materials and markets is self-evident. Various future developments that could endanger international peace may be seen in these regions.</p>

<p>The Security Council Meets Today [Our Newspaper News] New York, 5th broadcast: The UN Security Council will reopen tomorrow. U.S. Representative Stettinius will be temporarily replaced by Johnson after resigning. The issue to be discussed at tomorrow's meeting is the Franco-Spanish issue.

<h3>Saying Yugoslavia is Generally Mobilizing, British Foreign Office Unable to Confirm, Secret Troops in Germany Dissolved</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 4th dispatch] A Foreign Office spokesman declared today: London newspapers headlined that Yugoslavia has generally mobilized, but the Trieste report is not enough to confirm this statement. The situation in that area is expected to be tense, but there is no need to worry.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Wuppertal, 5th dispatch] British military authorities here revealed yesterday that the semi-secret Yugoslav Royal Army, which was training in the British occupation zone of Germany, has been ordered to disband. This is because the personnel of the army obstructed the plan to send Yugoslavs back to their country, and after British intelligence personnel found evidence that they were privately selling military equipment, it was decided to disband them. According to reports, the army has 45 generals, 1,500 officers, and 15,000 soldiers, commanded by former Yugoslav cabinet member General Zivkovic. They were originally prisoners of war captured by Germany, and 90% of them supported King Peter.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th dispatch] Angora Radio broadcast today that a reporter from the Anatolian News Agency in Athens said that activities have recently increased on the Greek-Yugoslav border.

<h3>To Maintain the Dignity of the Monarch, Britain Opposes the Trial of the Japanese Emperor, the Soviet Union Opposes Maintaining the Japanese Emperor's Face</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th dispatch] Authoritative sources here say that the British side is currently exerting extremely strong pressure through senior diplomats to prevent the Japanese Emperor from suffering insults that are inconsistent with his imperial status. Ever since rumors spread that the Japanese Emperor would be regarded as a war criminal and tried, British representatives in Japan and other local diplomats have fought hard against this view. Britain believes that any plan to put the Japanese Emperor in a state that is undignified or embarrassing is a direct attack on the monarchical system. However, the Soviet side has indirectly expressed that it does not want to maintain the face of the Japanese Emperor.</p>
<h3>President of the International Bank, U.S. Journalist Elected</h3>

<h3>The American Invention of Flying Wing is Approaching the Speed of Light, Almost Invisible in the Air</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hawthorne City, California, 4th dispatch, United Press] The U.S. Army Department today released the structure of a small Northrop flying wing powered by two jet engines. Mr. Northrop designed the aircraft to be able to pass through the enemy's aircraft wings at a speed approaching the speed of light, cast into a solid wing piece, and made entirely of magnesium. The beauty of this wing lies in attacking enemy aircraft, cutting off their wings or tails. When the aircraft is flying in the air, it is almost invisible, because there is no fuselage. We can only see a wing that looks like a knife edge whistling across the high sky. The way the pilot controls the aircraft is unimaginable in other types of aircraft. The wings are only 38 feet long, and the head and tail are a total of 14 feet. The aircraft is equipped with four machine guns. The flying wing bomber recently invented by Mr. Northrop is now preparing for a test flight.</p>
<h3>Italian Citizens Vote to Decide to Adopt a Republican System, Savoy Royal Family Announces Its Submission</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 5th dispatch] It was officially announced today that the Italian citizens' vote has decided to adopt a republican system, and King Umberto II of Italy and the Savoy royal family have therefore lost power. The Ministers of the Army and Air Force jointly issued a public announcement saying that the nationwide citizens' vote in favor of the republic has been more than the royalist party. The number of votes that have not yet been counted is insignificant. The number of votes in favor of the republic is more than 1.8 million votes higher.</p>
<h3>Soviet Influence Deepens in Central Europe: All Slavic Nations Have Become Dependent; Whether This Will Stop is Still Unknown</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 4th] According to sources in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia: Slavic nations in Central and Eastern Europe have now formed a bloc and become dependent on the Soviet Union. This proves that the Soviet Union has, in a short period after the war, organized these countries and made them lean towards the Soviet Union. The speed of its success has understandably concerned Western democratic nations, especially regarding how far the Soviet Union intends to expand its sphere of influence westward. Regardless of whether the Slavic nations form a bloc or not, there is no doubt that Soviet influence has deeply penetrated Eastern and Central European countries. The active support of Czech President Edvard Beneš in organizing the bloc is particularly noteworthy. In the past, the unity of the Slavic people was mostly theoretical, but according to Beneš, it will become a reality in politics and culture in the future. A rather complex key issue is that most Slavic countries fall within the sphere of influence that the Soviet Union has long wanted to establish, that is, from the German port of Stettin in the north to New Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and the Adriatic Sea in the south. Hungary and the Balkan countries are also within this sphere, except for Greece and Turkey. Most Slavic people are located east of the 15th meridian, including Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Croatians, Serbians, and Bulgarians, in addition to Russians. Looking at a map, the area east of the 15th meridian corresponds to the Soviet sphere of influence from Stettin to the Adriatic Sea. Whether this situation is accidental or has greater significance is something we cannot know unless the Soviet Union indicates whether it intends to extend its sphere of influence to the English Channel. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union wants to control Austria, but whether it will stop there after controlling Austria is difficult to predict. Whether the Soviet Union's ambitions have limits or will continue to expand is unknown. We must know that the Soviet Union has more than one way to expand its influence. One of them is to promote communism in various countries to establish Soviet governments, which is also a reason for the concern of Western democratic nations. The Soviet Union is still thinking about gaining a foothold in the Mediterranean, and there are also several major issues in the Far East that need to be resolved urgently. Unless the Soviet Union's ambitions are unlimited, we believe that the time when it will be satisfied in Europe is not far off.</p>

<h3>The Chief of Reform, The Number One Chinese Traitor, Liang Hongzhi is Interrogated, His Confessions are Mostly Absurd and He Uses Fallacious Arguments</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Liang Hongzhi, the leader of the puppet "Reformed Government" and the number one Chinese traitor who first colluded with the enemy and betrayed the country in the Hua Zhong area, was interrogated for the first time yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m. by Judge Liu Yugui of the Special Criminal Court of the High Court, along with Prosecutor Dai and Assessors Qiu and Cao. The court ordered a postponement of the trial.</p>
<p>Liang Hongzhi, whose courtesy name is Zhongyi, is 64 years old and from Changle, Fujian. When he was brought to trial yesterday morning, he was wearing a blue Indian silk long gown, yellow socks, black cloth shoes, and had a shaved head with white hair. His face was fleshy, and he was hard of hearing in both ears. When he entered the court, he carried a Japanese-made notebook, which contained many pages of defense information. He also brought a black leather eyeglass case, and he put on old glasses when reading the documents, looking like a Confucian scholar. After reading, he carefully put them away and constantly straightened his collar with his right hand. According to his confession, he has four or five family members, and all his property has been reported to the Military Statistics Bureau. He said that he organized the "Reformed Government" because the central government could not recover the occupied areas or move people inland, nor did it implement a scorched earth policy. The Japanese invaders looted, robbed, burned, killed, and raped with impunity. The land of three provinces and two cities in central China, which accounts for a quarter of the country's population, is the essence of the country. In order to preserve the country's vitality and alleviate the suffering of the people, he entered "hell" and willingly did so. Then, he answered the charges listed in the indictment one by one, using fallacious arguments and making broad statements about merit and demerit, which were rebuked by the judge. He then said: "I have no military force to take over the customs." Subsequently, his lawyers, Zhu Hongru and Li Guozhen (Zhang Shizhao did not arrive), submitted four documents from the Military Statistics Bureau and other organizations, and applied to summon Xue Dake as a witness.</p>
<p>Change to the National Flag</p>
<p>The judge asked: "When did you start discussing the organization of the puppet regime and with whom?" He answered: "In the spring of the 27th year with Chen Jintao, Chen Qun, and others." Asked: "Did you contact Tadayoshi Matsuzawa and Shiyuu Minamoto?" He answered: "I don't remember. Chen Qun contacted the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Military Headquarters." Asked: "Did you talk to Mamoru Shigemitsu?" He answered: "No, the Japanese Embassy sent a Secretary Shimizu to contact us." Asked: "Who was responsible for the two departments of the puppet Reformed Government?" He answered: "In addition to me being the head of the Executive Yuan, Wen Zongyao was the head of the Legislative Yuan, Chen Jintao was in charge of the Ministry of Finance, Ren Yuandao was in charge of the Ministry of Pacification, Hu Chengtai was in charge of the Ministry of Justice, Chen Qun was in charge of the Ministry of Interior, Chen Lu was in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Huang Zihui was in charge of the Ministry of Industry, Chen Zemin was in charge of the Ministry of Education, and Jiang Shaomei was in charge of the Ministry of Railways." Asked: "Did you change to the Five-Color Flag?" He answered: "Because the Japanese army insulted the Chinese people and the national flag, I changed to the Five-Color Flag." Asked: "How many people were in the Ministry of Pacification?" He answered: "There were four divisions, and the commander was Ren Yuandao, with a nominal strength of 20,000, but in reality, Liang Hongzhi during the trial (photographed by Yu Chuangshuo) was not up to this number." Asked: "How was the tax collected?" He answered: "It was collected by Shao Shijun's Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Tax Bureau, with a monthly income of eight or nine million." Asked: "How much capital did the Japanese side have in the joint Japanese-puppet Hua Zhong companies?" He answered: "I don't know. We cooperated to regain sovereignty."</p>
<p>Indiscriminate Issuance of Counterfeit Money</p>
<p>Asked: "What about the Hua Xing Bank?" He answered: "It had a total of 50 million, with the Japanese contributing half." Asked: "How much Hua Xing currency was issued?" He answered: "We requested 20 million, and 6 million was approved. In reality, only 3.07 million yuan was issued." Asked: "How were the Hua Tie and Telecommunications companies distributed?" He answered: "They were jointly used by China and Japan." Asked: "What about the Salt Affairs Agreement?" He answered: "Initially, the salt production was completely monopolized by the Japanese Navy, and the people suffered greatly. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance negotiated and established a joint venture." Asked: "What was the work of the puppet Anti-Smoking Bureau?" He answered: "It was run by Zhu Yao. The Japanese sold alcohol, and we banned it." Asked: "Was the tobacco tax 20 to 30 million?" He answered: "Only 1 to 2 million." Asked: "What did Wang Jingwei come to Shanghai on April 5th of the 28th year to talk about?" He answered: "We didn't talk about politics, just went through the motions for an hour." Asked: "On April 6th of the 27th year, you went to Ping to meet Wang Kemin, and Wang came to see you again on the 27th of the same month. In September, both parties sent representatives to Dalian to organize the Joint Committee of the Puppet Chinese Government?" He answered: "Yes, the purpose was to (1) implement the exchange of goods (coal, rice) between the north and south; (2) jointly deal with the harsh demands of the Japanese army." Asked: "Did you and Wang Jingwei meet in Nanjing on the third day of the 28th year to jointly prepare the puppet national government?" He answered: "No, we only discussed this on March 2nd of the 29th year." Asked: "What impeachments did you make during your tenure in the puppet Control Yuan?" He answered: "The biggest one was the rice case of Zhou Naiwen and others." Asked: "What was the result?" He answered: "Nothing." Asked: "What did you do as the head of the puppet Legislative Yuan on November 20th of the 33rd year?" He answered: "Only revised one or two regulations and detailed rules of various departments."</p>
<p>Husband and Wife Console Each Other</p>
<p>Asked: "When did you turn yourself in?" He answered: "On July 15th of last year, I entrusted a friend to deliver a letter of surrender to Director Dai of Chun'an, Zhejiang. A month later, I received an order from Chairman Chiang to go to Nanjing to handle the handover and work in the advance headquarters until October 20th, when I surrendered to the Military Statistics Bureau." The interrogation ended at 5:40 p.m. After being received, his wife comforted him. Liang's attitude remained optimistic.</p>
<h3>Initial Meeting of the Bureau After the Supplementary Registration of Grain Decides to Conduct Another Inspection</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] I recently interviewed Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Wu Kaixian, to inquire about the exact amount of grain registered in the city. According to reports: The total amount of grain registered for the first time was about 440,000 dan. The supplementary registration, which was carried out for the second time, was just completed the day before yesterday. Because the various trade associations had to submit the figures for the supplementary registration to the bureau yesterday, the exact amount is still unknown. However, the Bureau of Social Affairs has decided to send personnel to conduct a supplementary inspection to prevent private accumulation or deception. As for Rong Yongming, the owner of Wu Chang Rice Store, who was detained again for price gouging, he is still being held at the police station. The method of disposal has not yet been decided.</p>

<h3>Grand Gathering at Kang Le Restaurant; Journalists Welcome Veteran Journalist; Dean Yu Discusses Newspaper Affairs and Encourages Reporters to Work Harder</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, Pan Gongzhan, president of this newspaper, and Cheng Cangbo, president of Xinwen Bao, held a tea party at Kang Le Restaurant to welcome Dean Yu of the Control Yuan, who recently came to Shanghai from Nanjing. Those invited to accompany them included Wang Yunsheng, Hu Pu'an, Xu Jilun, Wang Xiaolai, Zha Liangjian, Hu Jianzhong, Zhou Qianchong, and more than fifty others. Dean Yu, with his flowing silver beard and simple blue cloth gown, was energetic and approachable. Yesterday's weather was extremely hot, and he fanned himself non-stop, but his speech was passionate and powerful, reminding people of his fierce and unparalleled style when he advocated revolution in the early Republic.</p>
<p>First, Cheng Cangbo gave a speech, praising Dean Yu as "the ancestor of the press," and said that during the Chongqing bombings, Yu did not change his enthusiasm for protecting the press. When the heads of various newspapers gathered to discuss publishing a joint edition, it was at Yu's private residence.</p>
<p>Dean Yu then stood up and gave a speech amidst warm applause, briefly stating that Shanghai has the most newspapers in the country. For decades, Shanghai has always been the key to many major events, so Shanghai is really Shanghai for newspaper reporters. All newspaper reporters should know the situation of the past eras of autocracy, warlordism, and the Anti-Japanese War and understand the meaning of the current new era. This time in Shanghai, he was excited to see the development of Shanghai's newspaper industry and the vitality of newspaper reporters, which have exceeded the past. The higher the news value of Shanghai, the higher the status of Shanghai. The fate of China also lies here. During the Anti-Japanese War, the spirit of hard work in the Chongqing press was inherited from the spirit of the Shanghai press before the war. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been successful, all sectors of the country are still paying attention to Shanghai newspapers, because Shanghai has better conditions for machinery, printing, etc. than other places. I hope all comrades will recognize this point and not give up easily. We must know that this position is of great importance to the country and the world.</p>
<h3>Those Who Win the Hearts of the People Prosper, Those Who Lose the Hearts of the People Perish</h3>
<p>Newspapers are the army of the people. Newspapers occupying a place is the same as the army occupying a place. At the beginning of the enemy's invasion, they came to Shanghai first and tried their best to trample on Shanghai's newspapers and cultural institutions because they knew that this was a great force. However, newspaper reporters do not just serve newspapers, but serve humanity. If a newspaper deliberately makes improper claims, it will not be welcomed by the people, and its power will be lost. Therefore, the power of newspapers is great, but the authority of the people is even greater. For thousands of years, those who win the hearts of the people prosper, and those who lose the hearts of the people perish. Colleagues should follow this principle, take big steps, and move forward bravely. When I ran a newspaper in the early years of the Republic, all the staff members went to the army, and the newspaper could hardly be published. I told them: "A pen is more precious than many guns. If you really want to be a revolutionary, a pen is more powerful than many guns." Today, the responsibilities of reporters are even heavier. I deeply hope that they will work hard.</p>
<p>Then, Zha Liangjian, the president of the local court, said that the relationship between the press and the judiciary is very deep. Before the Pacific War, court personnel and newspaper reporters suffered the most coercion, inducement, and even assassination. In this new era, new world, and new China, consular jurisdiction has been abolished, and the court feels that its responsibilities are even greater. I hope that the press can cooperate with the court to lay the foundation for the rule of law. Xu Jilun said: He was also a reporter for the Shishi Xinbao back then and deeply admired Dean Yu's spirit of running a newspaper. To this day, he still does not miss a newspaper and does not miss a news item. Wang Xiaolai said: Newspaper reporters can be "members of the supervisory committee," assisting in correcting mistakes, which is twice as effective. Wang Yunsheng said: The Shanghai press should inherit the spirit of the Anti-Japanese War and work hard for national construction. He recalled that Dean Yu once had a debate with Liang Qichao because Liang praised the abundance of talent in the Pearl River basin, which was refuted by Yu, who came from the Yellow River basin. If a split occurs today, there will inevitably be a north-south dispute. Dean Yu should advocate more for the north, because the government must not abandon the north. (At that time, Dean Yu replied that this debate was forty-two years ago.) Hu Jianzhong said: If the press can cooperate with the work of the supervisory and judicial branches, the results will be great. He also said that running a newspaper today has become a kind of enterprise. The era of writers and political commentators running newspapers has really passed. As for yellow journalism, the press should be vigilant and resist it for the sake of the country, society, and the integrity of the newspaper.</p>
<h3>No Politeness for Grain Loan Fraud</h3>
<p>Dean Yu Answers Reporters</p>
<p>Dean Yu answered this newspaper's questions: (1) Regarding the grain loan fraud case, it is under strict investigation. If it is true, then "we will not be polite to them!" (2) Regarding the treatment of civil servants, it should be based on the cost of living index, but the burden on the national treasury is too great. This matter will be determined soon and will be announced soon. (3) To investigate the takeover matters in various places, the Control Yuan will send seven investigation teams to investigate in various places, but the candidates have not yet been decided.</p>

<h3>The Wife of Murderous Demon King Wu Shiba o, A "Red Person" Who Covered the Skies with One Hand During the Enemy-Puppet Period: Interrogating the Wealthy Widow She Aizhen; Denying All Accusations with Claims of "I Don't Know" or "It Didn't Happen"; Afraid of Losing Face? Frantically Waving Hands to Prevent Reporters from Taking Pictures, Saying, "What's There to Photograph?"</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] She Aizhen, the wife of the puppet special agent and demon Wu Shiba o, who, along with Jin Jiqing, the wife of the traitor Li Shiqun, was known as one of the two great rich women of Shanghai during the enemy-puppet period, was interrogated yesterday afternoon at the Special Criminal Court No. 2 of the High Court in Ti Jian Bridge by Judge Yang Ding and Clerk Li Jinzhang, with defense provided by lawyers Yu Zhongluo.</p>
<p>She wore a black silk patterned cheongsam, her hair in a bun, with pointed-toe black cloth shoes and light yellow gauze stockings, a white gauze handkerchief in her hand, and a fair and clear complexion. During Judge Yang's questioning, she calmly replied, denying each accusation with either "I don't know" or "It didn't happen." When photographers tried to take pictures, she either turned her head away or covered her face with her handkerchief, revealing her embarrassment. As she was being escorted back to prison after the interrogation, photographers surrounded her again. She waved her handkerchief frantically, running and muttering, "What's there to photograph," and "How annoying," causing the onlookers to burst into laughter.</p>
<p>In court, She spoke pure Shanghainese, stating: I am forty-six years old, from Guangdong, and live at No. 49, Lane 749, Yuyuan Road. I worked as an accountant in the security guard team of the Waiting for Work Headquarters. I have one son and one daughter. All my assets have been reported to the Military Intelligence Bureau. Regarding the reported value of my assets being 500 million yuan, She claimed this was not true. She added that it might be due to the current price increases. I married Wu Shiba o when I was thirty years old, at which time Wu was working in a gambling house. In the 28th year of the Republic [1939], I joined the puppet organization and became the captain of the 76th Headquarters' security guard team, under the jurisdiction of Li Shiqun. After my husband went in, he couldn't come back, and in May of that year, I moved in to work as an accountant, but this was merely a "showing face" position, in name only. Wu Shiba o knew how to read, but not fluently. His acquaintance with Li Shiqun was through a friend's introduction. My motive for joining was because Li Shiqun told me that "Mr. Wang" would be coming to Shanghai to protect the people of the occupied areas, so it was necessary to organize a security guard team to protect "Mr. Wang." At the time, I didn't know it was the Investigation and Statistics Bureau. I only met Chen Bijun once. I knew Zhou Fohai, Li Shiqun, and the wives of Ding Mocun, etc., but there were no sworn sisterhoods. I didn't join any gangs and didn't take any apprentices. I am completely ignorant of gang hierarchies. As for the accusations that I served as a staff officer and deputy director of the 76th Headquarters, there is absolutely no such thing. I am just an ordinary woman. As for training special agents, I have no ideas myself, so how could I train other people's ideas? As for arresting and killing political prisoners, I don't understand politics, I have no opinions. Wu Shiba o never fired a gun or executed anyone when he was around. As for the kidnapping, extortion, gambling monopolization, and earthmoving, these things were likely done by others during the chaotic situation, and the responsibility was placed on the 76th Headquarters. Wu Shiba o's actions were all under the orders of Li Shiqun. The internal organization was complex, and I didn't advise, so I don't know clearly. Wu Shiba o was just a captain. He resigned after a year, and Li Shiqun suspected him of wanting to betray him, so he detained him for over fifty days. On the third day after his release, he went with Li Shiqun to Suzhou and was killed by the Japanese. This was on the nineteenth day of the twelfth lunar month in the 30th year of the Republic [1941].</p>
<p>Madam Fang Yexian Asks for Justice</p>
<p>When the judge asked about the 76th Headquarters' mass killing of Bank of China employees, She said she didn't know. At this point, Fang Dai, a witness, was called to the stand. Fang sobbed as she testified: I am fifty-five years old, from Ningbo. My husband, Fang Yexian, was the manager of the China Chemical Industry Society. On July 25th of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], he was kidnapped by men from the 76th Headquarters and his whereabouts are still unknown. I am submitting a statement asking for justice. The defendant was questioned about this, and She claimed she didn't know. She also said: Wu Shiba o didn't do illegal things when he was around. At that time, if someone committed a crime, the superiors would also take care of it, and everything wasn't that simple. Please investigate in detail.</p>
<p>The court then confronted She Aizhen with the statement given to the Military Intelligence Bureau by Shen Fenggang, the director of the 4th Division of the 76th Headquarters, which stated that Wu Shiba o's actions were all participated in by his wife. She Aizhen responded by asking whether Shen did more things or Wu did more things, and requested that Shen Fenggang be brought in for confrontation.</p>
<p>When the prosecutor asked about harming Central Government personnel, She said: I have never harmed anyone. At that time, "Li Shiqun, Mrs. Li," "Ding Mocun, Mrs. Ding," etc., all lived inside the 76th Headquarters. What great power did I have to manage anything?</p>
<p>Regarding Wu Shiba o taking apprentices, She equivocated, saying: They were recruited by Li Shiqun. There were only fifty security guards, including Zhang Guozhen, who was later killed by the Japanese, and Pan Da and Xia Zhongming, who were also figures in the Special Agent Headquarters.</p>
<p>Yesterday was an investigative hearing. At this point in the interrogation, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning. The defense lawyer requested permission for the defendant to meet with her family, which the court granted. She then whispered with her daughter for several minutes before being escorted back by the bailiffs.</p>

<h3>One-Armed Thief Arrested: Involved in Major Cases in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The famous bandit Hu Zhenmin (see photo), twenty-two years old, from Jiangbei, has been active in Shanghai for many years. His left arm was severed by a machine many years ago. He commands his gang, relying solely on his right hand in battle. Therefore, he is known in the underworld as the "One-Armed Hero." He has led more than a dozen major cases, including the robbery of forty-nine pieces of woolen fabric from the Zhicheng Western Clothing Store on Beijing West Road, the robbery of fifteen overcoats from a Western tailor shop on Kaina Road, and a large amount of gold jewelry from the Laotianbao Silver Shop in Dapu Bridge.

<h3>"The Tiger of Jiangyin," Truly or Falsely Drunk? Zhang, the School Principal Who Survived the Tiger's Mouth, Resolves Not to Consider Private Favors; Shimoda Jiro to Be Sentenced on the 8th</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Shimoda Jiro, the principal culprit in the Jiangyin Massacre, "The Tiger of Jiangyin," was brought in for interrogation again yesterday afternoon by the First Pacification Military Court. At the previous public trial, Shimoda admitted that there were indeed underground workers killed in the Jiangyin Gendarmerie on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival last year, but denied that he had participated in the matter himself, and presented former squad leader Oimota Seigi, Ozaki Fukuzo, Horita Kunio, and Ozaki Kenichi as four people who could prove that he was drunk and asleep at the time of the incident, and asked the court to investigate. When the court opened yesterday afternoon, defendant Shimoda Jiro was brought in first. Shimoda was wearing a grass-green military uniform, holding a military cap, and wearing long yellow leather boots, appearing quite calm. The presiding judge questioned him in detail. After questioning about the drinking situation at the time, the first witness, Oimota Seigi, was brought in for questioning. Oimota replied that he did not know whether Shimoda was drinking. Then the second witness, Ozaki Fukuzo, was brought in, who claimed that he did not know whether Shimoda was drunk. However, he heard that many people were drunk. Then the third witness, Horita Kunio, was questioned, who said that he saw Shimoda and others drunk that night, because he saw him arguing with [name unclear]. The presiding judge then asked whether the fourth witness, Ozaki Kenichi, should be summoned again. Shimoda said it was not necessary, they were all young and afraid to speak in court. Then Zhang Yuren, the principal of Jiangyin Middle School, who witnessed the massacre, was called as a witness. Zhang was over fifty years old, pale and thin, wearing glasses. He stated definitively that the eleventh and twelfth people killed that night were killed by Shimoda. He was the thirteenth person. Because he served as an enemy agent on the surface but was actually an underground worker, he was on good terms with Shimoda, so Shimoda saved him and hid him in the toilet. Shimoda was indeed his lifesaver, but because Shimoda killed too many people in the past, he resolved not to consider private favors and came here to testify. Prosecutor Lin presented a conclusion stating that the witnesses presented by the defendant had no definite proof on whether the defendant was drunk, and their words were contradictory. On the other hand, witness Zhang Yuren, who witnessed the massacre, was indeed arrested and his life was saved by the defendant, so he would not make false accusations. Please sentence the defendant according to law. Obligatory lawyer Qian Naiwen stood up to defend, saying that the defendant's past killings were not involved in this case. What should be discussed now is the incident of August 15th. It was the Mid-Autumn Festival that day, and it was after hearing the news of surrender. The defendant may have been drinking to relieve his sorrow. As for Zhang Yuren's statement about the situation at the time, it seemed too detailed, which aroused suspicion. Finally, the presiding judge announced the end of the debate in this case and scheduled the sentencing for 2 PM on the 8th of this month.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Is Planning to Distribute 6,000 University Students from Nanjing, Shanghai, and Zhejiang; Many National Universities Feel That School Buildings Are Insufficient</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Nanjing] During the War of Resistance, about 100,000 patriotic youth joined the army, including public officials and students. Among them, about 10,000 were university students and high school graduates or those with equivalent education. By the end of May, they will be discharged from the army and need to be distributed to various national universities for further study by the Ministry of Education. There are more than 8,000 such students in Chongqing. The staff of the Ministry of Education stationed in Chongqing is handling the distribution and placement of these students near Chongqing, following the Minister's instructions. In Zhejiang, there are 1,854 such students. The local authorities have sent a letter to the Ministry of Education, reporting the number of students who need to resume their studies and requesting the Ministry to distribute them. Including the students from the temporary university preparatory classes and preparatory classes in Nanjing and Shanghai, the total number is about 6,000, who need to be distributed to various universities. The person in charge of Nanjing Central University stated that the university has 4,100 students, and the current school buildings can only勉容容容容容容 accommodate 4,000 students. With the addition of hundreds of students to be enrolled after the summer vacation, the school buildings are really not enough. Although there are national schools in Shanghai, such as Jiaotong, Jinan, Tongji, Shanghai Medical College and Business College, and Fudan, because there were not many original students before, the school buildings are not spacious. At this time, there are more students than before the war, and some school buildings were destroyed during the War of Resistance. They also feel that the school buildings are not enough to accommodate new students, so each school considers the school buildings to be the biggest problem at present. The Ministry of Education is making every effort to plan and allocate the distribution of 6,000 university students, hoping that each school will accommodate more. Because the distribution is mostly at public expense, it must be a national school. If distributed to private schools, the public expense will be more difficult to bear. (壹)</p>

<h3>Homer of Provence</h3>
<p>— Xi Shou</p>
<p>Provence is a province in southern France, with a sunny climate, dry land, and beautiful scenery, famous for producing olives, grapes, mulberries, and oranges. The local language is resonant, harmonious, and rich in vocabulary, capable not only of expressing concrete and moving objects, but also of conveying the most subtle thoughts and the most elegant sentiments. The customs are quite different and possess a Greek flavor.</p>
<p>Frangois Mistral was an optimistic and honest farmer who, at the age of fifty-six, remarried a young girl named Adelakle (or Delaide) as his wife, and she gave birth to this Homer of Provence.</p>
<p>On September 8, 1830, this future great poet was born at the Mas de Juge in Maillane and named Frederic. He spent his childhood in the fields, feeling the beauty of the southern countryside from a young age, listening to all the proverbs and songs of Provence, and absorbing the wisdom of his fellow provincials. Frederic Mistral reluctantly left his hometown to study in Avignon, and later transferred to Aix to study law. After graduating from law school, he hurried home one night in August. His father allowed him to choose his own career. Several months later, he said:</p>
<p>"Filled with this kind of surging wave, this force of Provence fills my heart, and I instinctively incline towards all literary inspiration or governance. An independent and unrestrained spirit protects me, and nothing can disturb me. One evening, while sowing seeds, I saw the farmers singing in the furrows as they followed the plow, and it was then that I began to write the first poem of Mireille."</p>
<p>Since he engaged in literature, he made it his vocation to apply the Provençal language to literature, and all his works were written in the local dialect. Furthermore, on May 21, 1854, he joined with six other southern poets, Joseph Roumanille, Theodore Aubanel, Anselme Mathieu, Alphonse Tavan, Paul Giera, and Jean Brunet, to found the Felibres Association at the Chateau de Fontsegugne near Avignon. The word "Felibres" is borrowed from a popular hymn, PO-rison de Sainto Anselme. This song depicts Jesus in the temple discussing with the seven wise men (Sept felibres). The purpose of the association is "to preserve the Provençal language, spirit, free pace, national honor, and outstanding wisdom." Their writings were published in L'Almanach provencal, founded in 1855. The leaders of the association were Mistral, Roumanille, and Aubanel. After the publication of Mistral's collection of poems, Mireille, in 1859, it was praised by all members, and he rose to become the leader. He devoted his life entirely to the Felibres movement with his unparalleled talent, tireless spirit, and selfless attitude.</p>
<p>Mistral's poems were never written sitting in a study, but rather in the wilderness, pacing and breathing in harmony with nature, while reciting his poems. He rarely stopped to record them in a notebook because he had a strong memory. In his masterpieces Mireille and Calendal (1867), there is the robust breath of Provence, the muscular movements, the free and simple character, the large intestines, the fertile plains, the northern wind of the south, the wildness of the mountains and the sea, as well as the customs, traditions, and scenery of Provence.</p>
<p>In the era of wandering bards, the era of Villon, the Renaissance era, the classical era, and the romantic era, those poets also explored the Greek customs, and only sang about salon women, palace maids, and young women being spied on or spying on their lovers, mostly following a single model. It is rare to see someone like Mistral singing about women. The protagonists Vincent and Mireille in his Mireille are like Romeo and Juliet. The young girl Mireille shows elegance, shyness, love, and respect. Her radiant spirit and pure beauty shine throughout the poem.</p>
<p>"Mireille, in her fifteenth spring… the pleasant sunshine opened her up, her face was fresh and innocent, with two dimples on her flower-like cheeks. Her gaze is like a drop of nectar that dispels sorrow… her rising breasts are like a large peach, not yet fully ripe. She loves to play, she is very lively, but a little bit wild! … Ah! Seeing such beauty, one can swallow a cup of water in one breath…"</p>
<p>The musician Gounod set Mireille to music as an opera, which spread widely throughout the world.</p>
<p>In 1855, his father passed away, and Mistral personally managed the Mas de Juge. In the spring of 1858, he traveled to Paris for the first time, where he was introduced to Martin by Adolphe Dumas. Martin read his poems and praised them endlessly.</p>
<p>Mistral worked on Calendal for seven years, and the final section of the poem took almost six months to write; but he still dared not let go easily, because he wanted to carefully polish the words and find a more resonant rhyme… He was truly a brave poet. The protagonist of the poem is a boy from Cassis – a young fisherman who catches whitebait. Because he loves a woman named Estérelle, he becomes a hero and does many extraordinary things. Once, he wanted to become rich and invented a fishing device that could drive all the fish in the sea near the dock. Another time, a robber in the Araules valley was chased into his den by Calendal… Calendal was truly a formidable child! In the limestone cliffs of Lu, there is a cypress that is so high that it is unattainable, and no logger has ever dared to go up there. Calendal dared to go up, and he lived there alone for a month. During this month, people only heard the sound of axes chopping trees. Those huge old trees fell one by one into the abyss. When Calendal came down, there was not a single cypress tree left on the mountain… Later, because of these many merits, this little fisherman finally won the love of Estérelle.</p>
<p>Mistral translated most of his works into French himself, and the French literary world considered him one of the great writers. In 1861, he received the Academic Prize, and in 1863, he received the Legion of Honor. In addition to the above-mentioned advantages, Mistral's works also have linguistic and ethnological value. From 1878 to 1886, he also published two volumes of the Provençal-French dictionary, entitled Lou Tresordoufelibrige, which is the best dictionary of the Provençal language and has been reprinted. From 1899, he began to organize the Arles Museum (Musee arlesien), which was established in 1909 in the Laval-Farré mansion in Arles. In 1905, Mistral received half of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Other major works include the novel Nerte (1884), the tragedy La Reine Jeanne (1890), the memoirs Mes origines, memoires et recis 1906, the poems Lis Isclo Dor (1876), Le POEME du Rh one (1897), Communion des Saints (1859), and Les Olivades (1912).</p>
<p>Mistral passed away on February 23, 1914, at the age of eighty-four.</p>
<p>Mistral's poems can be said to be untranslatable. Now, let us tentatively translate a poem from his masterpiece Mireille as follows, to conclude this article. The translation can only convey the original meaning, but cannot express the beauty of the original text, which is naturally expected. Magali, ah, my love, Magali, please lean your head against the window and listen to this morning music. The drums and violins play together. The sky is full of stars, but the wind is already silent. The stars saw my love and immediately gradually faded. "It's just the branches murmuring, I'm really worried about your morning music! I want to throw myself into the chestnut sea and become an eel in the rocks." "Ah, Magali, if you become a fish in the waves, then I am the fisherman, and I will catch you again!" "Oh! If you become a fisherman, when you cast your net, I will become a bird and fly to the wilderness." "Ah! Magali, if you become a bird in the sky, then I am the hunter, and I will shoot you down." "Ah! Magali, if I become a poor corpse, then I will become the earth and embrace you well!" "Now I finally believe that you are not teasing me. This is my glass ring, beautiful youth, for you as a souvenir!" "Ah, Magali, you bless me! Once they see you, ah, Magali, look at those stars, they have all been extinguished."</p>
<h3>The Land of Banyan Trees and Red Lychees</h3>
<p>— Ke Di</p>
<p>Living in the atmosphere of war, I am often involuntarily driven on unexpected journeys. I remember it was the early summer of 1942 when I bid farewell to the mountain city and headed southeast along the rugged and dangerous southwest highway. In order to adjust the hardship and fatigue of the journey, I was able to stay briefly along the way, appreciate some memorable customs and local conditions, and embellish this tired journey: in Guiyang, the secluded and beautiful Huaxi; in Guilin, the dangerous and unique peaks and the misty Li River; in Hengyang, the turbid and rapid Xiang River and the faint shadows of the peaks of Mount Heng... I once stayed and traveled, and the differences in customs and languages in various places added more interest.</p>
<p>Because at that time the enemy's constitution was frantically harassing the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway area, not only did it prevent my progress, but it also increased the sudden danger to life, so I was once again thrust into the refugee group and began my third escape. Starting from Shangrao overnight, climbing over the Fen Shui Pass at the junction of Fujian and Jiangxi, bearing hardship and danger, I walked into the land of banyan trees and red lychees - Fujian.</p>
<p>Initially entering such an unimaginable realm, everything aroused my new and special feelings. In my mind, I always imagined that it must be a place with a very harsh climate, with many miasmas and epidemics, and that everything was relatively backward. However, my ideal was corrected by the facts I faced, and gradually curiosity gave rise to love.</p>
<p>I love to look at the huge, shady, evergreen banyan trees. In their shade, I often invite my friends to have pleasant picnics. I love to listen to the powerful songs of the boatmen on the Min River fighting the rapids when they are beaching their boats, which makes people feel the hardship of life. And the most attractive things are the specialty waxberries and lychees, which can be exchanged for incredibly cheap prices for things that are unparalleled in freshness, which everyone will greedily indulge in.</p>
<p>Due to the constraints of work, I lived in this land of banyan trees and red lychees for more than half a year. My psychological state gradually changed from novel exploration to passionate love. I learned the complex Min language, I loved to listen to the strange Fuzhou local dramas, I loved the Yan River by Yong'an, I greedily bathed in the famous hot springs of Fuzhou, and imperceptibly my living habits and hobbies were assimilated by my environment.</p>
<p>Now, in the fragmented memories, I occasionally extract some quiet dream shadows, but after all, it is always worth savoring.</p>
<h3>Construction and Art</h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>In the past eight years, Shanghai artists have contributed the least to the country, but we have not given up on our work at the base. We also dare to say that we have made considerable efforts at the base.</p>
<p>From today onwards, we must move forward on the road of construction. To build a modern country, material and spiritual aspects should advance simultaneously. The two are like the left and right hands, indispensable. Therefore, in emerging countries that are launching material construction, they should not forget to promote spiritual construction. In China, where it is urgently necessary to promote science, art should also be actively promoted.</p>
<p>Before the past eight years, science, agriculture, medicine, and engineering were the most important, and art was too neglected. After various tests during the Anti-Japanese War, we should not forget a psychological foundation. We know even more that the upward development of national life is half based on culture.</p>
<p>The revitalization of art depends on the government and society on one hand, and on the artists on the other. The government should plan, promote, and reward, while the artists should research, produce, and even create. With such cooperation, results can definitely be achieved. At the same time, everyone in society should bear the joint responsibility of promoting it.</p>
<p>Shanghai already has an art association organization. After careful and thorough preparations, a grand exhibition of works will be held first in this city. As for the work to be done in the association, such as the preparation of art museums, the publication of art periodicals, the roving exhibitions in various places, and the art propaganda to the international community, etc., we hope that every artist will exert their own enthusiasm in order to assist our national construction with collective efforts!</p>
<p>Long Continuous Serial</p>
<h3>Double Swallows Flying Together (46)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, it was the winter solstice. The weather in Beijing was much colder than in Jingzhou, and the houses were all iced up. Zhihua was somewhat unable to withstand the onslaught of the severe cold, and inevitably became lazy in her studies.</p>
<p>One day, Zhang Xian wanted to teach Lihua how to practice her stage movements. Lihua was learning the play "The Drunken Concubine" at this time, and Zhang Xian asked her to take off her cotton clothes and wear only a single shirt, and then have her perform a few waist-bending postures. Lihua refused, so Zhang Xian forced her. Lihua finally learned half of it, but couldn't hold on and fainted to the ground! When she woke up, she found herself being held tightly in Zhang Xian's arms, and still only wearing a single shirt. So the memory of a few months ago immediately floated into her mind again. She pushed Zhang Xian away in uncontrollable rage, picked up her cotton clothes, and walked out. But Zhang Xian also changed his face and shouted sternly:</p>
<p>"Keep practicing! You're not allowed to leave."</p>
<p>Lihua didn't listen, stubbornly answering him:</p>
<p>"I will leave! See what you can do to me? You bad person, you don't deserve to be my teacher!"</p>
<p>These words angered Zhang Xian. Without saying anything, he grabbed Lihua with one hand and whipped her body hard with the horse whip used on the stage with the other. Pitifully, that already frozen and hungry flesh was beaten with bloodstains, covered in cuts and bruises!</p>
<p>Lihua rolled on the ground. In extreme pain, she couldn't help shouting loudly for help, but there was no response at all. Because this was also a condition that Zhang Xian had agreed upon with Mrs. Mo in advance. He stated that he had the right to beat his apprentice and that no one else was allowed to interfere. Therefore, even though Mrs. Mo heard Lihua's cries, she couldn't come over to stop or persuade her.</p>
<p>"Will you listen or not?" Zhang Xian deliberately stopped and loudly "justified" his question to Lihua. "Now give me practice again from the beginning!"</p>
<p>Lihua didn't dare to disobey, so she had to crawl up, but couldn't stand up! Her limbs trembled with pain. Zhang Xian thought she was resisting him, so he angrily and forcefully whipped her buttocks again. At this time, Lihua shouted loudly, her eyes went black, and she fell down suddenly, her soul floating out of her body like catkins!</p>
<p>Seeing this, Zhang Xian was afraid that he would cause a life-threatening disaster, so he had to stop, pick up Lihua, and put on her cotton clothes for her. He sprayed her awake with cold water. Then, pretending to be panting, he called Mrs. Mo over.</p>
<p>"This young lady of yours has a really big temper. After being beaten a couple of times, she gets so angry that she almost dies. I won't dare to teach her anymore in the future. Please hire someone else!" Zhang Xian said, picking up his huqin and preparing to leave. Seeing Lihua's dying look, Mrs. Mo, although feeling sorry for her daughter, couldn't help but endure the pain and let her daughter overcome this learning difficulty in order to realize her own vain dreams. In addition, she didn't suspect that Zhang Xian had abused Lihua. She completely believed Zhang Xian's words, and she knew that Lihua's temperament was indeed not good. So not only did she not blame Zhang Xian, but she apologized to Zhang Xian and repeatedly asked him to forgive Lihua and continue teaching her. Moreover, she voluntarily offered to increase the tuition fee to forty hanging coins per month starting next year.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Trading is Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was weak. Initially, "Double Horse" brand yarn was quoted at 1.3 million yuan, but there were no actual sales, only a small number of transactions among dealers. The price gradually dropped to 1.28 million yuan. Other 20-count medium and small yarns also fell by 10,000 yuan. Due to the lack of buyers for 42-count two-ply yarn, holders were determined to sell at a lower price. Although the price was 100,000 yuan lower than before the holiday, only three to five bales were sold. At noon, Fangjian Textile Mill, as usual, opened yarn sales, with prices for 10-count to 40-count single yarn reduced by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and prices for 32-count two-ply and finer yarns reduced by 100,000 to 300,000 yuan.

<h3>Tea Market Sales are Strong</h3>
<p>May and June are the months when new teas from various producing areas enter the market one after another, so customers are vying to purchase them. Tunxi and Suian are also green tea production areas in China. This year's new "fried green" tea has arrived in Shanghai in recent days. Dealers are negotiating with holders, but holders' attitudes are bullish. As a result, Tunxi tea is difficult to agree on for the time being, but the new Suian "fried green" tea has been agreed on, with an opening price of 130,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Market sentiment is firm. As for other varieties, shops and stores in this street and in Suzhou and Wuxi still have a strong appetite. At the same time, Tianjin and other areas, due to excellent sales, also plan to purchase actively. In the foreign tea market, Jardine Matheson is also continuing to inquire about Fine Eyebrow green tea.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Shows Slight Loosening</h3>
<p>The market for bituminous coal has been strong for days. The large holders who were previously suppressed have all taken advantage of the high prices to sell, and new entrants are also limiting their purchases to actual sales volumes due to various rumors, so the market has slightly loosened. Bituminous coal blocks have immediately returned to equilibrium. The sales of various grades of anthracite coal are still brisk, especially Yangquan anthracite coal, where the holders are all small players with insufficient capital. The market price continues to fall as these holders are forced to sell at a loss.</p>
<h3>Rayon Declines, Silk Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Although there has been some attempts to boost rayon prices in recent days, they have often risen only to fall again.

<h3>Sugar Market Prices Increase Slightly</h3>

<h3>Pig Sties Reduce Commission - 3.5% of Value</h3>
<p>(Our report) Since the livestock market was ordered to close, the original pig sties have been preparing to resume business, as reported in the previous issue. It is now learned that the business they operate is largely the same as the market, but to reduce costs and suppress meat prices, it has been agreed that the commission charged will be uniformly 3.5% of the value, including all tying, trimming, weighing, and lifting fees, with no additional charges. It is said that the livestock market's commission was 3% of the value, but it was also necessary to charge 3% for tying and other fees, for a total of 6%.</p>
<h3>Encouraging Trading with Floating Capital - Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks Perform Well</h3>
<p>Initially, popular Chinese stocks were sluggish. At the low prices, Yong Yarn was 5,600 yuan, Meiya 4,100 yuan, Jingfu 288 yuan, Xinguang 267 yuan, and Qinxing 210 yuan. However, after floating capital generally activated small, less popular stocks, they soared and were not easily bought. Some of the floating capital had to return to the popular stocks, so they recovered from weakness and closed at high prices. As a result, Yong Yarn and Meiya rose slightly, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by more than half a percent. The less popular, small stocks varied depending on their assets and age, with investors making different choices, rising by 10% to 20%. After the market closed, the buying price for old, less popular stocks such as Xinho (Xinho has a 1-for-4 bonus share announcement) was raised even higher. After noon, there were even higher bids outside the stock exchanges for various stocks. Foreign stocks also performed well after initially being flat. The activity of securities firms increased, which contributed to this. Yi Yarn, which had retreated from around 11,500 yuan to 11,000 yuan, was finally pulled up to over 12,000 yuan. British-American Tobacco rose from 10,100 yuan to slightly below 11,100 yuan. Other stocks were also slightly brought up to close. As a result, Yi Yarn and British-American Tobacco rose by about 10% compared to the previous day's close, and the rest by about half a percent.</p>

<h3>White Tung Oil Exports are Slightly More Active - High Costs and Inconvenient Transportation - Difficulties Ahead for Export</h3>
<p>White tung oil export trade has been interrupted for eight years since the war, and it is not easy to recover. Before the war, the average monthly total was around 5,000 to 6,000 tons. Since Shanghai was recovered last year, only a few thousand tons have been exported up to the previous month. Last month, due to the slightly lower price of Hankou tung oil, goods arrived in Shanghai one after another, and exports gradually became more active, totaling about 1,500 to 1,600 tons, which is incomparable to pre-war levels. However, looking at world prices, China's prices are uniquely high, so foreign trade cannot be developed without adjustment. Recently, a considerable amount of Hankou tung oil is still arriving. Dealers are opening at 64,000 to 65,000 yuan and selling at 66,000 to 67,000 yuan. Hongjiang tung oil remains the same. Qufeng Zheng Hong is at 100,500 yuan, Dachang Fengxi Deputy is at 80,000 yuan, Xiao Hengqing is at 78,000 yuan, Dayou Feng is at 76,000 yuan, and Xu Rongchang Liu Qingyuan Feng is at 73,000 to 74,000 yuan. The sales market is not active, and the market has little fluctuation.</p>
<p>It is also noted that the China Vegetable Oil Factory has tung oil refineries in Chongqing, Wanxian, Hankou, Changsha, Hong Kong, Kowloon, Wuzhou, and Shanghai. The largest of these is the Wanxian factory, which has a monthly production capacity of about 2,000 tons. The other factories can also produce 500 to 1,000 tons. In addition to supplying some for domestic sales, the rest is sold to Europe and the United States, with Hong Kong and Shanghai serving as separate transshipment centers. One thousand tons were exported from Shanghai last month, with each ton calculated as 2,000 city dan, and each dan priced at 67,000 yuan. One thousand tons have already been exported from Shanghai this month, totaling 5,600 barrels. According to the person in charge of the factory, the cost and export price cannot be balanced due to the inability to reduce domestic prices, the lack of transportation, the waste of time, and various restrictions on equipment and materials. To break the deadlock, it depends entirely on reducing costs and connecting transportation. Most importantly, if the shipping industry can restore bulk cargo barge transportation, a large amount of tung oil can flow in, not only preventing it from being frozen but also increasing overseas sales, earning foreign exchange, and consolidating the international trade market.</p>
<h3>Chinese Tea Sales to Britain</h3>
<p>British Information Service London, 5th The London Daily Herald reports that Chinese tea will be sold in Britain this autumn. The Food Department has approved an import of 2.5 million pounds for this year, which is equivalent to 30% of the level from 1936 to 1938.</p>
<h3>Commercial Summary</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Due to tight credit and sluggish sales, the market transactions are very rare. Fine cloth is brought down by 500 to 1,000 yuan, but white cloth and linen yarn are slightly stronger by 1,000 yuan because the summer season is approaching. According to previous reports</p>
<p>Lychee Seedlings A letter from Longxi said that a bumper harvest was expected, but according to recent follow-up news, the situation has changed suddenly, with only about 30% to 40% of the harvest, so the new market is expected to be not too small.</p>
<p>Hardware Large hardware black and white iron pipes have arrived in the first batch, and each store has a large amount of goods. Promoters are holding them as scarce goods, and the market has not seen a decline. Small hardware is in short supply, and door locks and drawer locks are constantly setting new prices.</p>
<p>Seafood Sea salted products, fennel, fragrant vegetables, and Ningzi are rarely inquired about, and the trend is stagnant. Sago, tapioca, seaweed, laver, and agar-agar are oversupplied, so they have declined. Coix seed, black moss, Ge Xian rice, and Qian Yuan fish skin have sporadic sales, and it is feared that it will be difficult to establish a foothold. Xianglian, wood ear, dried shrimp, and pickled mustard are actively traded. However, Longkou vermicelli stands out, with scarce arrivals and high heat, so the trend is quite firm.</p>
<p>Wood After the holiday, transactions are still rare and the market is soft. However, sellers are still waiting and watching, and prices are still holding. It is also heard that several tens of thousands of feet of Lauan wood will arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>Cigarettes It is rumored that the import of tobacco raw materials is prohibited. British and American cigarettes are selling well, and prices have risen. Old Knife Yunlie and Chinese cigarettes are also showing strength because British and American cigarettes are firm.</p>
<p>Chemical Raw Materials The prices of various goods are flat. Only caustic soda is in high demand and the price is rising daily because it cannot be imported. Insurance powder and bleaching powder are declining daily.</p>
<p>Correction The promoter of the Fair Dyeing and Weaving Factory listed in this newspaper's New Enterprise Survey was Tian Fengfeng. It is now learned that Mr. Tian's name is Fengqi, and he is the general manager of the factory. This is especially corrected.</p>

<p>Engineer's Day Special Issue</p>
<h3>Some Current Problems for This Year's Engineer's Day</h3>
<p>-- Zhao Zukang</p>
<p>This year's June 6th is the Sixth Engineer's Day, coinciding with the first year of victory in the War of Resistance. It seems that we engineers have two special meanings in commemorating this festival: first, a review of our contributions to the War of Resistance, and second, an encouragement for us to take responsibility for national construction. During the eight years of arduous War of Resistance in China, our engineers worked tirelessly and made continuous efforts. In terms of industry, factories, ordnance factories, etc., were established to create machinery and products to reduce the difficulties of material and military supply shortages; in terms of transportation, important railways were built; Highways and airports were built to facilitate the transportation of military supplies. This kind of contribution originally belongs to the immortal achievements of our entire engineering community, but compared with the contributions of the engineering community of the Allied countries, it seems inevitably insignificant. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, how should we continue our efforts to strive for the world's first-class technical level, which is commensurate with our country's first-class power status? This is the understanding we should have in reviewing the contribution of the War of Resistance. The meaning of national construction is very broad. Economic construction, such as developing resources, developing transportation, increasing production, and prospering cities and rural areas, are all the tasks of our engineering community, and are even more arduous than the work of the War of Resistance; It is not easy to talk about economic construction because of the current transportation difficulties in China, production stagnation, high prices, and surging labor disputes. However, we must use the latest scientific and technological technologies to develop reserves, while putting labor on the right track and giving full play to its effectiveness, so that the land can be used to its fullest extent and people can do their best, so that the country can move towards prosperity and happiness. This is our inspiration for taking responsibility for national construction. Now, based on my thoughts at the moment, I will briefly list some special ways in which we can work hard as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Study the use of atomic energy All engineering technologies develop with scientific inventions. For example, with the invention of steam, engineering machinery mainly uses steam; with the development of electricity, engineering machinery mainly uses electricity. During this war, atoms have been used as a tool of destruction. After the victory, European and American countries have spared no effort in studying the lack of atomic energy. In addition to military needs, they are also studying how to apply it to general machinery. In the United States, there is already a proposal to drive an atomic train. According to this trend, it will not be difficult to have one day when the use of atomic power is universal. We engineers are in this atomic age, and it seems that we should catch up, pay special attention, and cooperate with the government, industry, and engineering colleges to establish atomic research institutions to study the combination of atomic science and engineering applications.</p>
<p>(2) Participate in the work of developing Northeast resources The resources in Northeast China are extremely rich in salt, and the Japanese have devoted themselves to operating them and achieved success. During this war, the enemy used it as one of the bases for invading us. The northeast is rich in phosphorus, mainly coal and iron; agricultural products are mainly rice, wheat, sorghum, and soybeans; the vast forests can be used for timber; the railway network is far denser than in the interior. Heavy industries such as steel, munitions, machinery, and textile mills account for 70% of the country. Therefore, the Northeast has long been noted by the great powers. It is now heard that 80% of the machinery in heavy industry has been dismantled and transported. The population of the Northeast, on average, is not dense, with a total of only 30 million people. If it is proportional to the south of the Great Wall, it can be increased three times. Therefore, those of our engineers who have ambitions should go together and participate in the active development work, and be advocates for other employees.</p>
<p>(3) Leading worker training to maintain discipline - Discipline training is as important as technical training. Without technology, the project is difficult to be perfect; without discipline, the efficiency of work cannot be increased. After the victory. Taking Shanghai as an example, due to the high cost of living, workers in various industries have successively gone on strike to demand increased wages. Some of them have seen a decline in production due to increased wages, so the capital side is unable to maintain it, closing factories or reducing working hours; those factories that have not resumed business are deeply wary and remain closed. This situation has ultimately led to both sides being injured, which is really worrying for the future of national industry. We should know that the hardships of life are a common phenomenon after the war. Workers' treatment should be adjusted as necessary at any time, and the work must be done by our engineers to lead the masses, guide them well, in order to stimulate patriotic sentiments, change the atmosphere, and move together towards the road of construction. It is the great fortune of the country.</p>
<h3>Ports and Our National Construction</h3>
<p>— Shi Konghuai</p>
<p>A nation's people's livelihood, economy, and culture all depend on transportation for progress. The development of modern transportation is changing daily and improving monthly. On land, there are railways and highways; in the air, there is air transport. However, up to recently, especially at this moment, the focus of China's transportation is still on waterways. And the hub of waterway transportation is naturally the port. All international trade inflows and outflows, as well as the collection and distribution of large quantities of goods, are handled here. More than nine months have passed since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, but industrial production remains stagnant, prices are still difficult to lower, and the suffering of the people's livelihood has not been alleviated. The most significant reason for this is the failure to restore transportation and the inability to ensure smooth transportation. Therefore, it is an obvious fact that all future construction should focus on transportation first. Given the current poverty of our country's material and financial resources, discussing aviation and manufacturing a large number of airplanes is simply unrealistic. When it comes to railways and highways, with the current high cost of materials, even repairs are difficult, let alone construction. Even railways such as the Pinghan Railway, Jinpu Railway, and Beining Railway have not yet been fully unblocked. Various highways are also underutilized due to a lack of vehicles and small carrying capacity. However, waterways and ports are the easiest to restore. The shipping of the Yangtze River has seen a daily increase. Although the port of Shanghai was devastated by artillery fire, the recovery of prosperity has been rapid. This is because ports are not easily damaged, and waterways are mostly formed naturally, not requiring a large amount of human labor to build. Moreover, China has many waterways and ports; this is a natural advantage. Therefore, fully utilizing waterways and ports, developing transportation, and using it as a precursor to all construction is most appropriate given our country's national conditions and current economic and financial situation.</p>
<p>The more complete ports in our country are Shanghai, Guangzhou, Qingdao, etc. However, Shanghai is the most prominent in international trade. Therefore, the urgent tasks at present are: (1) Dredging waterways to facilitate shipping. During the Anti-Japanese War, the ports, waterways, and docks were not dredged, and the riverbed has inevitably silted up. Not only that, but the ships and equipment used for dredging were also transferred and lost by the Japanese army. It is easy to imagine the difficulty of undertaking eight years of undredged projects with incomplete equipment. It is necessary to replenish equipment and work hard to complete the mission. (2) Repairing docks and warehouses to accommodate ships and goods. Historically, it is only natural that maritime transport is frequent after wars. The warehouses and docks used in peacetime before the war are now insufficient after the war. It is necessary to add more docks and warehouses so that ships have docks to berth at and goods have warehouses to store. (3) Adding large and small ships to facilitate passenger and cargo transportation. The total tonnage of our country's ships before the war was not very large, and it was greatly damaged during the war. In addition, after the abolition of unequal treaties, foreign ships cannot travel on the Yangtze River and along the coast. The feeling of a ship shortage is inevitable. It is necessary to actively add ships to meet the needs. (4) Improving loading and unloading equipment to seek agility and economy. The loading and unloading equipment in our country's ports is very simple, relying entirely on manual handling. Currently, wages are so high, and work efficiency is so low, making it difficult to lower commodity prices. Moreover, the rate of loading and unloading goods at the docks after the war is much slower than before the war. It often takes a long time to load and unload 1,000 tons of goods, not only increasing unnecessary expenses but also affecting the flow of materials due to the slowness of loading and unloading. It is necessary to actively install mechanical loading and unloading equipment to allow ships to depart from the port earlier and materials to circulate quickly, thereby reducing the cost of loading and unloading goods invisibly and turning to lower prices. All of this relies on good port management; not only Shanghai but also ports everywhere should strive to achieve these goals. If we can persevere and forge ahead, we can revitalize international trade externally, and internally, agricultural and industrial products from all over the country can flow freely. The carrying capacity of ships is far greater than that of airplanes, trains, and cars, and their cost is lower. Therefore, considering the current national conditions, the primary focus of construction should be on ports and waterways. Our country has undergone military upheavals, and all undertakings need to be revived. The way to revive is to construct. The materials for construction, such as the machinery needed to revitalize industry, the wheels needed to improve transportation, and the materials needed for various construction projects, almost all now come from abroad. And the goods that come from abroad must first arrive at the port and then be transported inland from the port. Therefore, the port bears a huge responsibility and is the key to the country's revival. This is one reason. The port is the throat for the entry and exit of goods. Not only must maritime and waterway transport be smooth, but also inland transportation, such as railways and inland waterway transport, must be as integrated as all the blood vessels. Therefore, there must be sufficient railways and sufficient inland waterways to connect with each other. In this way, the smoother the cargo transportation, the more prosperous the port, and the greater the demand for railway and other transportation. Therefore, the port is the central hub of all transportation and the mastermind of all other transportation construction. This is the second reason. Furthermore, it concerns the communication of domestic and foreign cultures, the revival of the economy, the exchange of materials, the promotion of commerce, and the increase in tariff revenue, all of which depend on the development of the port. Therefore, the port is in the most important position in the country's construction. If we say that the grand plan for building the country should begin with the construction of ports, who would say it is inappropriate?</p>
<h3>Huangpu River Tunnel Problem</h3>
<p>—— Dr. Zheng Hua at a Youth Conference</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th) at 2 PM, the Engineering College of Zhejiang University invited Dr. Zheng Hua, a consultant of the Ministry of Transportation, to give a lecture at the Shanghai Youth Association on Sichuan Road on "The Huangpu River Tunnel Project." More than 500 students, engineers, and guests from the school attended. Dr. Zheng has served as the chief of the Design Section of the Ministry of Railways and the director of the Capital Railway Ferry Project Office. He has very profound research on bridge, tunnel, and ferry engineering. In light of the city's active promotion of the plan to connect Pudong and Puxi, Dr. Zheng's opinions are worth our careful consideration. Dr. Zheng believes that building bridges, whether high-level or flat-level, are difficult to be suitable given the existing circumstances. High-level bridges have too long approach bridges, which will inevitably cause inconvenience, while flat-level bridges are even more difficult to realize due to the heavy boat traffic in the Huangpu River. As for building tunnels, low-level tunnels are difficult to construct, costly, and have long approach roads. Dr. Zheng suggests building high-level tunnels. The method is to make multiple sections of the tunnel on the shore using steel plates and reinforced concrete. After dredging the riverbed with a dredger, the prefabricated tunnel sections are transported to the construction site and sunk section by section to form a tunnel connecting Pudong. The top of the tunnel is just at the bottom of the river to avoid obstructing navigation. The tunnel is built near Zhongzheng Road, with the entrance located near the Bund of Nanjing Road, sloping downwards 60 feet to Zhongzheng Road and then turning 90 degrees to cross the river. Dr. Zheng estimates that this project will cost only 6 million US dollars and take about 18 months. The project is not difficult, the construction cost is not high, and there is no need to rely on foreigners for technology, capital, materials, and craftsmen. It is a very good and appropriate solution. Dr. Zheng also believes that this tunnel project does not require foundation work in terms of geological conditions, and the procedures are very simple. After Dr. Zheng finished speaking, people from all walks of life put forward opinions for discussion, and the meeting adjourned at around 3 PM.</p>

<h3>DDT</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The weather is hot, bedbugs and mosquitoes are out in force, sleepless nights, and listless days are a great suffering.</p>
<p>Friends mistakenly believe that those of us who are internal affairs reporters can avoid such a disaster, which is a fallacy, because when we finish writing at 4 AM and return home, we are exhausted, and the bugs and mosquitoes wreak havoc. It's truly a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>The craze for DDT is justified.</p>
<p>Which brand is effective? It's sad to say that this expense, up to now, has cost me more than 20,000 yuan. As a result, every night I still toss and turn, dripping with DDT! Dripping with DDT!</p>
<p>I know that I am not the only one who has been cheated. Mr. Director of the Health Bureau, can you crack down on those slippery goods and prove the effectiveness of those that actually work!</p>
<h3>Foreign Methods of Evicting Tenants</h3>
<p>— Youqin</p>
<p>Three landlords in New York City have been imprisoned for the following crimes:</p>
<p>The first one - dressed two children as demons, wearing strange robes made of metal fragments, clanging chains, and told them to hide in the attic and make mournful, ghostly crying sounds.</p>
<p>The second one - dug a small hole in the tenant's bathroom wall and offered people free "peep shows".</p>
<p>The third one - buried explosives under the house and detonated them to "scare away tenants they couldn't evict".</p>
<p>China - Shanghai - Nanjing - are all experiencing housing shortages. Isn't it the same abroad? Chinese landlords and sub-landlords always talk about "connections" (條子). Don't foreign landlords want money? Looking at the three landlords above, aren't they the same in the East and West? Their purpose is nothing more than to evict the tenants they can't evict, and the purpose of evicting tenants is nothing more than to sell the house or rent it to someone else. In the end, isn't money the root of it all?</p>
<p>However, the first method is almost childish and playful; the second method is too "ugly"; the third method is a bit too extreme. So, the result is that they are taken to the authorities! After all, it's not as effective as our noble countrymen borrowing the power of authority to oppress tenants!</p>
<h3>Yellow Croaker Market</h3>
<p>— Bing Shi</p>
<p>In late spring, there is a large gathering period in the ports of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River - this is the season for fish spawning. The general people of our country's inland rivers, using conservative fishing techniques, probably want to know the excitement of this popular food distribution center.</p>
<p>The season comes as people plan, and the embankment is filled with dust and a suffocating smell. The houses, however, are brand new, with bright red backgrounds and black characters: ×× Fish Company, attracting a group of "helping ocean spawning" people; teahouses have become exchanges. The number of people coming in and out is visibly increasing, and their faces are filled with tension and joy. Sit down and have a cup of tea, and someone will come up and chat with you. Once they start talking, they talk so forcefully. Usually, the cheeky young men who tell jokes are also leaning against the table, seriously listening to the discussion about water, climate, wind direction...all of which are talking points. In the din of voices, there is a rich aroma of wine. Small punts carrying cargo to the inland rivers are parked in the inner harbor, neatly arranged. Contrasted with the turbid yellow river water and the green edge of the embankment, it can be said to be a beautiful scene.</p>
<p>The harbor is docked with small sampan-shaped boats, pitching up and down with the white waves. When the tide recedes, they are stranded on the sand. The flags of ×× Fish Company are hung at the stern of the boats. These sampans are called "fresh-catching boats". On the earthen city wall by the river, people are always looking out, searching in the surging river water. The wind sends chills from time to time. People do not flinch. The river water hits the scales and slams into the beach. If the masts of the masts appear at the intersection of water and sky, the people on the earthen city wall go crazy. They will never relax their goal until the black spot is clearly identified as a fishing "ocean-going boat". The "fresh-catching boat", which is lazily lying across, welcomes the "fishing boat" with all its strength like a scale bar. Waves fly everywhere, vividly showing a rowing competition.</p>
<p>A fishing boat entering the port is a great fortune. The fishmongers are agitated, vying for each other. The owner of the fishing boat, having a whole hold full of lovable fish, puts on airs. They are very proud. The fish they catch are their fortune. Otherwise, how can they return with a full load? The fishmongers, in order to collect commissions, inevitably slap the table, and in the end, their face is the referee and the winner. After passing the inspection of the garrison and responsible authorities, it is time for the crew on the fishing boat to enjoy themselves. The fishmongers set up a special banquet to welcome him - the "shore-landing wine". The squinting, smiling fishmonger accompanies his wealth creator with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The fishing boats return with a full load. Relying on the power of the wind-driven sails, they are packed inside the port, head to tail like cherry blossoms lying down, and the upright masts are as numerous as the chimneys in the factory area. The soaked fish nets are hoisted high, like iron nets in the war zone. After the rain clears, the wet sails hang on the masts. Groups of people with fish scales all over their bodies began to move around, buying goods, drinking, gambling, and prostituting themselves... creating a night market under the petrol lamps.</p>
<p>From a distance, a strong fishy smell emanating from the fish market becomes more and more intense. The sounds of "Yo! Yo!" never stop, and groups of people carrying and backing rush back and forth. Empty baskets and baskets are all filled with yellow fish. All kinds of stalls are set up on both sides of the narrow streets, making the passage even narrower. If there is a pile of rubble or a small open field, it will not be deserted. Selling plaster, small snacks!... Naturally, there are also disguised gambling stalls, emerging at the right time. "One for ten thousand profit", "One Two Three", etc., piles of people here and there. If you want to gamble up and down, you are guaranteed to lose all your money.</p>
<p>Local hotels and shops are renovated. Prostitutes and singers... also rushed to do business.</p>
<p>The physique of the fishermen is healthy and strong. The two protruding eyes are bright and piercing. They are very talkative, and the flavor of fishing is often expressed in their mouths. Before the spawning season, they went to the vast ocean. During the spawning season, yellow croakers float on the surface of the sea, forming a huge school of fish. The sound of splashing can be heard from a long distance. The leader is the "fish king". The fishing boat that discovers the school of fish lets the fish king swim past before lowering the net. The "fish king" must not be offended.</p>
<p>The fate of fishing is entrusted to gods and Buddhas. The fate of the whole boat is also entrusted to gods and Buddhas. There is no reliance in the vast water and sky, no connection. After the spawning season, the fish sink deep and will never be eaten again. The happiness of a year depends on this one spawning season.</p>
<h3>Strange Procession</h3>
<p>— Sima Huan</p>
<p>Nowadays, such a procession is often found on the street. In front is a white triangular flag with the words "Patrol Team" written on it. Behind are marines, military police, police, and soldiers of the garrison headquarters. The uniforms are different, and the colors are not consistent.</p>
<p>This is a security force to maintain public order, but it has a shortcoming: no air force.</p>
<p>Following the example, it seems that each of the four classes of people - scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants - should also send a representative to participate.</p>
<h3>Mirror</h3>
<p>— Bian Shan</p>
<p>In a small barbershop, I suddenly saw a strange face of myself. I thought to myself, there couldn't be a funhouse mirror in a barbershop, right? In fact, it didn't seem like a funhouse mirror, because standing in front of a funhouse mirror would first make me feel dizzy, and there was no such effect here. Moreover, what was reflected in the mirror was indeed not a long face or a short, fat body, which made me even more suspicious: Is my face so unusually ugly? - Yes, I don't have a very handsome face, but I know that my facial features are always regular. However, what I am being told here is that my face is so strangely distorted. Is there anything missing? No. But it seems to have liquefied my face! My face is definitely not like this!</p>
<p>I was suspicious, perhaps when a person needs a haircut, there is a sense of slovenliness and ugliness. But I looked at the faces of others, the faces of the barbers, etc., and then looked in the mirror; I knew that this was a very dishonest mirror!</p>
<p>Therefore, when the barber finished my haircut and then took another small mirror and put it behind me, deliberately wanting me to take a look in the mirror, I immediately shook my hand; why should I be deceived again?</p>
<p>Back home, there was a broken mirror in the drawer. I took it out and looked at it, and I knew that this was my original face. Although it is so small, broken, and incomplete that it cannot show my whole body, this is a clear and correct mirror!</p>
<p>This poor mirror that was discarded in the corner of the drawer has now begun to regain its owner's love. It gives me a new revelation: A blurred or distorted full picture is not as good as a partially correct view! Because the latter can illuminate half of the face and then the other half; while the former is always blurred and incorrect.</p>
<p>Brief Collection of Three or Two Sentences</p>
<h3>Court Hearing Pass Costs 1,000 Yuan on the Black Market</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>The Nanjing Police Department arrested a magician and sent him to Tangshan Road by truck, ordering him to walk back to the city to show a slight punishment. Tangshan is 30 miles from Nanjing, and it takes eight hours to walk back. The method is good; but for friends who originally lived in Tangshan, it is an opportunity. If you want to get a free ride home, you might as well go and see a free performance by the magician.</p>
<p>Black market for hearing passes at the Capital High Court has been discovered. To get a hearing pass, you need to spend 1,000 yuan. Therefore, the conscription office of the Ministry of Military Affairs suggested to the High Court that attendees should present their organization's badges to avoid the black market. If this method is implemented, the black market can be eliminated, but whether they believe it will reduce the congestion of attendees, because badges will not speak.</p>
<p>The Drama and Film Association has set up a wooden box in the Sichuan Road Post Office specifically for reporting those who have defected to the enemy. The association has scheduled to open the box on the afternoon of the 6th. Once the reported persons are verified, they will be reported to the authorities for strict punishment. Of course, some people are inevitably worried about this. I think there is no need to worry, fortunately there is still a stage of "verification".</p>
<p>In the ten months after the victory, the poisons and utensils seized in the city were burned in public in the Bund Park on the 63rd Festival, including four opium beds, several packets of opium bubbles, worth more than one million yuan, a jade opium pipe, and several ivory tobacco holders. A gentleman takes money in a proper manner, so this should be used for medicine. Since it is not waste, it should be used. It is a pity to set it on fire. Fortunately, it is only "four pieces" and "several packs".</p>
<p>Shen Guiqin, the wife of Ren Shuidao, a member of the Propaganda Committee of the puppet Propaganda Department, filed a lawsuit with the court for divorce because she deeply hated her husband's deeds. Among the families of traitors, she seems to be the first to resolutely demand a divorce because she disapproved of her husband's actions.</p>

<h3>Gold Bars for Houses, Spring Breeze Delight Tower</h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>Recently, a child was bitten by a mouse at No. 21 Shou'an Lane, Maigao Bao Road, Baxianqiao. After being discovered, he was sent to the hospital, where he was dying and in danger due to excessive poisoning. Rats eating people seem to be no longer a strange talk, but rats in Shanghai biting people to death is still news.</p>
<p>It is said that the children of Chairman Yang, known as the King of Many Children, all use number plates as identification. Every time they go to school, they must be sent by two large trucks, which shows the large number of them.</p>
<p>It is well known that the Xinya Hotel on the Great World Road has become a cultural market for tabloid news. However, coincidentally, the Chunfeng Delight Tower in the southern city has become an economic market for gold bars for houses. It is divided into categories, bungalows and apartments. All good and bad conditions are based on the amount of gold bars as the standard. Every day, those who manage and run between them are bustling with activity, and the strange phenomenon of the Shanghai Bund also takes shape.</p>
<p>According to small merchants who "sell mobile glass": American cigarettes are made by the ubiquitous Jews, and many Jews come to major model offices to sell Western clothing materials, claiming to be British and American goods, but in fact, they are mostly Dongyang brand goods from the enemy-occupied era.</p>
<p>According to people from Chongqing: At present, during the repatriation, most people are still staying in Chongqing because it is difficult to return the coffins. They are all very anxious. Therefore, there are recent rumors in the market that someone is using "driving corpses to return home" as a slogan to solicit business. Some people even claim to have witnessed it with their own eyes, saying it is very convincing. Whether it is true or false, let's not talk about it for the time being, but it also shows the feelings of Jiang Laos in Chongqing.</p>
<h3>My Husband</h3>
<p>— Li Fen</p>
<p>In my house, there are five people in total, including myself. My husband is a businessman, leaving early and returning late. My second uncle works as a cashier at the bank. The bank has a club, and my uncle often hums a couple of Kunqu Opera pieces. Listening to him sing Li Qi from "Selling the Horse," he becomes quite proud, and also teaches me to sing "Cassia Branch." When my husband comes home, he also sings Zhao Chong. My eldest daughter likes to play the flute and has been taking lessons from a teacher for two months; she has memorized the score and can already play it on stage. She has learned "Crying in Prison" and "Writing a Petition." When it comes to after-dinner evenings or Sundays, everyone gathers together and sings at the top of their lungs. Sometimes we invite our sisters to enjoy it, which is very enjoyable. Fortunately, it doesn't cost much money and is much more refined than playing cards or dancing.</p>
<p>"Selling the Horse" cannot be considered pure Kunqu. True Kunqu comes from the "Zhui Bai Qiu" anthology. The lyrics are particular about literary elegance; the melody emphasizes the four tones. If even one word is sung incorrectly, it is considered a big mistake. The teacher pays special attention to correcting the pronunciation; learning it well requires a lot of effort.</p>
<p>However, what I personally find most valuable is that my husband was originally naturally impatient, always rushing around busily, and had a hurried demeanor. He often had a displeased look towards his family members. Since engaging in Kunqu entertainment, he has returned from extravagance to simplicity. He sometimes says to me, "In the past, I liked playing cards. Needless to say, I lost, and even when I won, I had to treat guests, costing double. Eating, drinking, and seeking pleasure seemed very foolish. Moreover, prices are high, and it's not easy to earn money. If I can just get by and have peace of mind, that's enough." So this year, we hired a flute teacher again, specifically to teach tunes of "Righteousness, Harmony, and Obedience." He has already learned "Drunken Beauty," "Breaking the Willow," "Yang Pass," and "Jealous Qiao." Once, at a Kunqu gathering hosted by the Kong family at Songyun Villa, he boldly sang a piece, earning applause from everyone.</p>
<p>My second son, Cheng, is sixteen years old this year, and his voice is clear. He likes to sing the role of a young official, so he is learning the tune "One String of Eight Yang." At the beginning, when he sings "Carrying the whole world of mountains and rivers on one shoulder," he sings the last word as "picking up" [挑, tiāo], and everyone laughs. He says, "If the load is placed on the shoulder, shouldn't you pick it up?" I told him that this is when Emperor Jianwen was in distress, sighing on the road. But he is young, and perhaps in the future, he will be able to learn the melodies very well.</p>
