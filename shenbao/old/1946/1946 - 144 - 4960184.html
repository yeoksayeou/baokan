<h3>堵塞開封附近缺口　聯總計劃黃河復道　復堤工程限于六月底完成</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕聯合國善後救濟總署署長賴加狄亞昨晚宣布：聯總各工程師現正領導一種戲劇性的企圖，欲將黃河堤岸一哩缺口，於七月一日以前堵塞完成，俾使中國二百萬畝肥沃田地，恢復出產。聯總工程隊現正集中工人十萬名，由中國政府付給工資，並由聯總供給飯食，俾使此一大河回至故道。河堤係於一九三八年用兵時決裂，以阻遇日軍前進。潮汛將屆，當務之急，乃在與時間競走，俾在七月一日以前，堵塞主要缺口，七月一日以後，河水即吿泛溢，非至潮汛過後，工程不能進行，此爲聯總最大規模之善後計劃。該項工程首席顧問工程師都德，在其致賴加狄亞電內稱：「自工程師立塲言，除去其他因素，此項工程可及時完成。如果徼倖，則潮汛在七月中旬以至下旬或不致來到，但吾人不能計及此層，完成工程，應以七月一日爲期。」聯總依照預定計劃與中國行政院救濟總署及中國政府其他機關合作，於今年初，進行復堤計劃，進行巨大堵口工程之工人，時時增加，現達一萬名。此輩堆築土堤，另有一部份在離鄭州不遠之山中鑿石。至七月一日，自開封至入海處四百哩堤岸，將有十六萬人作工，十五萬人在開封附近主要缺口作工，另有二千人在石山中作工，最後之堵口將爲岩石塡成之堤岸，由木樁架築成，每一木樁打入河床六十呎，巨型打樁機兩架，係聯總自美國運到。然後沿主要裂口建築闊約五六十呎之巨大堤岸，足有一哩之長。堤岸將用數千噸岩石及擔鐵絲網增强，以防水衝擊。據賴加狄亞稱：運輸與供應問題之困難，不下於實際工程，數千噸之材料必須由單軌鐵路運至鄭閘與開封間施工地點，主要材料必須來自五百哩以外之上海，目下日夜運輸，以加速供應品之運入該區。堵口復堤計劃中又包括大批人口問題，黃河故道內五百村莊中已有居民二十五萬人左右移殖，均在中共控制區域內，堵口寒沒黃河流入故道以前，此輩必須遷移。中國政府水利委員會黃河修堤工程，將歷十年之久。聯總正在技術上及物質上作緊急援助，重建並修復自鄭州至入海處四百哩長之河堤，以防止繼續泛濫。</p>
<h3>基薩向聯總提出報告　我糧荒形勢嚴重　三千三百萬人食不得飽</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕聯總上海分署前任總幹事基薩亦提出報吿，宣布中國糧食形勢，每况愈下。根據聯總最近調查，已有三千三百萬人食不得飽，其中七百萬人瀕於餓斃。聯總上次自中國接到報吿，食不得飽者爲三千萬人，目下飢荒最甚區域，或爲河南省，此外如湖南，廣西，湖北，江西與南方廣東人烟稠密區域，糧食亦多不足。各該省農作物，非再俟六十日，不能收獲，縱至彼時，收成亦遠不及平時。湖南爲飢荒地帶之核心，亦爲日軍侵略最後大戰之戰塲，農民男女現正親自拖犁，耕牛早已在戰時屠殺殆蓋。聯總在該省設立六大施粥所，每日賑濟飢民一萬七千名，並在偏僻區域設立小規模施粥所多處，供養飢民數千人，此輩過於孱弱，不能跋涉至較大之城市領粥，衡陽設有施粥站。飢荒迫使多數人行竊，被貧困父母所棄之嬰兒，堆如山積。安徽，江西·福建·山西·察哈爾及山東各省亦有飢荒，程度各異。聯總各工程師與時間競走如吿勝利，則黃河河床空出之地面，可於今年冬季以前出產小麥二千萬蒲塞爾。</p>
<h3>我國代表　請籲救濟</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿二日電〕我國代表今日於聯合國糧食農業機構第三次會議中，要求公允之食糧分配，運往中國。彼稱：中國所獲得者，尙不及四萬噸而所需則達一百萬噸，除非在今後數月內，自國外獲得大量接濟，則數百萬生命，無從獲救。法國提議由經濟社會理事會成立國際貿易局，以與聯合國糧食農業機構合作，達成供應之公平分配，捷克提議成立世界糧食會議，或聯合國糧食農業機構負責，並利用聯合國糧食農業機構秘書處及情報處，專司分配之估計，同時美國務院發言人證實杜魯門已函史達林，請求蘇聯合作，共同解決世界糧荒，白宮不久將發表關於社史協商之聲明說。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿二日電〕某高級中國糧食官員今日吿介衆社謂：事實上，迄今所採救濟中國糧荒之有效措施，均係中國自己努力之結果。中國將國內一部份剩餘之微小米糧，移往災荒最見嚴重之區域。澳洲運往中國之小麥，雖「勉符定量」，然所派食米，截至目前，經已收到者，尙離目標甚遠。渠繼稱：聯合糧食局所派食米十一萬五千噸，在一九四六年之第二季內，幾乎粒米未見運華，所經收訖之米，尙係一九四五年末季及一九四六年第一季內所應交者。田丕久一提起公訴</p>

<h3>女奸莫國康三項罪狀　京高院提起公訴　溫逆宗堯等已開始偵查</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿三日電〕邇來外界盛傳，陳逆公博死刑執行期，將於最近實現，記者今特往謁高院孫院長探詢，承吿尙未接奉任何消息，殊難有所　揣。記者綱詢以陳逆臨刑地點，是否將移第三監獄執行，孫院長面露微笑面答曰：二高院執行漢奸死刑，毋庸固定地點，况看守所內部已闢有新刑塲，惟中國司法係以密訊爲原則，故不能表示任何意見。依此推測，陳逆執行處，將以看守所內新刑塲爲較大可能也。</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿三日電〕女奸莫國康，係陳逆公博之外室，曾任僞立法院編修，立法委員，政治保衛局參事兼機要室主任等職，勝利後畏罪隨陳逆逃往日本，經中央電令拘送回國押解首都高檢處偵査，現已於廿二日提起公訴，起訴書數其罪狀，約可分三點：（一）歷任僞府簡任要職，（二）修正議制僞法，同意通過中日基本關係條約，中日滿共同宜言，中日同盟條約曁對英美宣戰宣言。（三）主管最高特務機關，刺探中央軍情，破壞抗戰機構，搜捕地下工作人員，殘害志士；實觸犯懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款之罪。按該案承辦檢察官，係原任蘇高檢處之檢察官王文俊，副本於廿三日由京送達此間蘇高院·</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>蔣主席飛抵瀋陽</h3>
<p>昨晚電訊；蔣主席昨日下午偕夫人飛抵瀋陽，國軍並已於昨晨卞一時進駐長春。共軍非法侵擾長春一個多月，長春市民昨晨又得夾道歡迎入駐的國軍。而飽嘗淪陷痛苦十四年約束北同胞，昨日得賭主席威儀，又値長春新遭兵燹之後，諒必有悲喜交集之感。</p>
<p>人民是希望和平的，政府是蘄求利平的，友邦人士也力助我們達到和平的。尤其是　主席的仁慈寬大，素信止戈爲武，年來一向主張對共黨問題用政治方式和平解決的。中央大員分頭努力，政協代表各方奔走，無非盼望化干戈爲玉帛，而今長春收復，中央接收東北人員可以重往工作，我們相信，只要共黨不再用它的部隊到處擾亂，在東北則讓中央接收哈爾濱市以及其他各省的行政，則和平談判在主席飛抵東北巡視撫慰以後，一定馬上即可重開。政局陰霾，自可一旦豁然開朗。故今後國內和平的關鍵，依然繫於中共黨員之是否眞有覺悟。</p>
<p>話又說回來，我們同時也切盼中央政府始終寬容，縱然共黨常常食言失信，仍然給他們以自新報國之路。只要中共恪守政協約協議，確實奉行停戰命令，中央還是應該不究旣往，迅速重啓協商之門。爲人民，爲國家，和平究竟比打仗好。</p>
<p>可是我們以爲協商應該有一堅定共守的原則，就是「合理·」協商是要根據「理」來協商，而決不是講敷衍求苟安的。故自命爲調人者，應該守着這公正的理，然後可以求得眞正的和平。</p>
<p>蔣主席抵瀋，長春收復，東北眞正歸到祖國的懷抱，國內應該有重見和平的曙光！</p>
<h3>集中精力解決大事</h3>
<p>— 謝雲翼</p>
<p>昨天本報接到許多讀者來函，其中討論物價－尤其是米價的，和公敎人員與軍隊官兵待遇的，不下八九封之多，眞是刋不勝刋；由此可以反映這些事已經形成政府當前所急應解決的大事，萬不能再等閒視之，用「等因奉此」的方法來兜圈子的拖下去了。國防最高委員會和行政院的一再討論公務員加薪案，上海市政府新市長視事後立即召集糧食會議，都表現着中樞和地方當局也的確重視這些大事了。然而可望有什麽成就呢？公務員還在那裏乾着急，米價則大漲小回，昨天却又白粳突跳三千，米蠶還在躍躍蠢動。假使物價漲勢一天不停，小民生活一天不安，而公教人員的待遇便沒有追得上物價的一天，工作效率更何從談起？</p>
<p>國府舉行還都大典之日，本報早就說過，政府當局必須痛下決心，與民更始。我們曾大聲疾呼：「寗可擱置一切的新政，而先集中其力量於穩定物價；寗可節省其他的政費，而儘先盡量設法提高軍隊官兵與公敎人員的薪餉待遇。」我們認爲：今天政府犬員如果還見不及此，那是不智；如果見到而沒有辦法去切實解決這些大事，那是無能；如果確已定有辦法，而瞻顧因循，畏首畏尾，不肯大刀闊斧痛痛快快的幹，那是沒有担當大任的勇氣。須知今天在政治上負責任，本應抱着「我不入地獄誰入地以」的大勇精神，故有辦法，趕緊幹，沒辦法放下担。國家大局，拖到今天，不許誰再來用「拖」字訣混日子了！</p>
<p>我們現且先來檢討公敎人員待遇的調整問題罷。物價高漲，公敎人員淸苦，甚至在儀餓綫上掙扎，這是誰都知道的事實。後方來的公務員，加上房荒的壓迫，連晚上舖位都成問題，更不必說。立法院會議公務員薪給提高一千倍的建議，報上一登，公務員還沒有得到實惠，物價倒反漲了起來，這種宣傳，愛之適足以害之。就算眞的要加到一千倍，姑無論國庫是否眞能負担，即使能够，則通貨膨脹，物價還不是更形上漲，公務員受益能有多少？可見調整公敎人員待遇，不是一個簡單問題。然而問題儘管繁複，我們以爲解鈴繫鈴，當局應該有一種以簡御繁的方法。昨天讀者來函中，顧仰平君的意見就値得提請當局重視。</p>
<p>顧君以爲：公務員的生活不能不救，然而在國庫空虛的今日，又那裏來這許多錢？試看怠工罷工，呼援加薪，一波未平，一波又起，剛剛妥協，物價又漲，又要調整待遇了。其實調整待遇的第一步，還不是在加薪而是在求公平。目前我們無可瞭解的，便是公務員待遇的不合理和不平等。同一地域或同一部屬的公務員，待遇的厚薄，竟判若書壞。我們單就上海來說，同一地，某些行局的公務員待遇，便比其他同在上海的國家機關要好；同一部屬如交通部的中航公司，國營招商局，郵局，鐵路公路局，電信局，又各有各的待遇，五色繽紛，雜亂無章。國家對公務員的待遇，旣有明確統一的規定，何以還要弄得如此紊亂？假如依工作的輕重和責任的大小來規定待遇的罷，恰又相反，聽說工作最艱苦，責任最重大的電信局公務員，所得待遇，未必高於他人，或且反而較低。這便呌你絕不會相信有政治常識的大官說的，他表示收入多的機關，待遇可以厚些，入不敷出的機關，待遇無法提高。照這樣說來，上自五院下至各地各級的政務機關的公務員，非但不能支薪，而且要帶些錢來津貼機關哩！國家不是一個營業的機構，怎可以把收人的多少來自行分配呢？讓這些關起門來打算盤的人來幹政治，如何會弄得好？一個待遇問題不能做到平等統一，還能望其他的統一嗎？現在各機關都可援待遇較高機關的例，要求提高待遇，呌各機關的主管人無辭可拒，循環往復，弄得沒有一個肯安心工作的公務員，又何况物價暴漲不已，風起雲湧的加薪要求，又何能二應付？這是當局處置不公，自食其（果。</p>
<p>上面引顧君來函中所述的事實，大員們實在不能再裝痴　。我們應該喚起手秉國鈞的大人先生的警覺：實際上在推動國家一切政務的，實際上在發揮政治效能的，不是單靠幾位權要，而是這成千成萬的公務員啊！公務員不能生活，何能推行政治？國家一切事業，所以陷於萎頓麻痹的狀態，公務員生活不能安定，實是一個大原因。濫發紙幣，無限制加蓋，不是辦法。利用高壓手段，一味拒絕要求，不是辦法。虛與委蛇，得過且過，混下去，更不是辦法。這些非但不是解決的方法，簡直無異政府的自殺。我們的確知道，正有許多公務員，死心塌地願為國家服務，願為國家受苦，他們更懂得和國家搗亂，便是和自已搗亂，決不會無理取鬧的。而目前之所以波蘭層出，糾紛不息的緣故，「不平」兩字爲之也！抑平物價，今天姑且暫勿討論，我們以爲政府大員，此時應首先集中精力，辦到公敎人員待遇合理平等這一件大事，庶幾可以洗刷去「無能」兩字的恥辱。曾憶本年三月中旬二中全會時，行政院提出「經濟緊急措施案」，確也規定了調整公敎人員軍隊官兵及國營產業員工待遇，務期公平合理的原則，並且指出了辦法。然而，時過兩月，調整如何？公平在那裏？合理在那裏？一個提案，決而不行，要它何用！「不患寡而息不均！」政府大員如果拖到今天，連這個待遇「不均」的病根還不能用快刀割治，連這個公敎人員的待遇還不能辦到合理公平的「統一」，我們眞不知該負責的大員們，精力集中到什麼大事上去了！</p>
<h3>余漢謀過滬晉京　在杭晤沈鴻烈等商浙治安計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿三日電〕衢州綏署主任余漢謀，廿三日晨來杭，即訪沈鴻烈，竺鳴濤等，商討浙治安計劃，本報記者即往訪晤，承吿現人民亟須休養生息，故治安必須維持，一切零星散匪，當在嚴剿之列。綏署所轄部隊，槪遵中央法令整編，編餘官兵亦經妥爲安置，現可於本月底全部完成。交通方面已派專員赴各重要地點視察，並商之地方政府，即予修通，靑年軍復員後，自有其他部隊接防。在漸日本戰犯極少，故不擬另設軍事法庭，逕解上海審訊。軍糧問題，由署內供應辦理。余氏午應沈主席歡宴，下午三時專車去滬，自留一日後，晉京謁蔣主席述職，並有所請示。</p>
<p>沈鴻烈談話</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿三日電〕浙主席沈鴻烈，廿三日召集浙蠶絲負責人商談，不使抑低繭價。又接見記者，發表東巡觀感稱；費時十日，視察十五縣，在衢開軍事會議，與綏署余主任商治安，交通，軍糧問題，承余主任多方協助，已獲得協議。區行政會議雖時間甚短，惟各縣事前準備相當充足，討論時亦多能開誠相見，縣政經費爲難，公務員警察均不能飽，人民於浩刦之餘，復以微糧等事相煩，益形困苦，所經各縣，除淳安，繭溪兩縣房屋較爲完整外，餘均瘡　滿目，今後惟有從建設着手。浙東今年雨水調勻，農作可望豐收，黨政民意機關聯擊甚好，實堪吿慰。</p>
<h3>建設南京</h3>
<p>— 本報駐京記者　毛樹奎</p>
<p>因爲東北的不能順利接收，和華北政局的不能安定，於是有人懷疑　都南京太偏於東南，恐對於遼闊的北方不能顧到，提義把首都遷到北平，或者可以把華北及東北動　不寗的局勢鎭壓一下，還搬出了歷史的引證說：建都南京是一時偏安之局，北平繼是萬年基業，一時在重慶閙得涵城風雨，第四届的參政會上也通過了一個遷都的建議，但不久事實證明我們的政府擯棄了一切異議，毅然決然還都南京了，遷都問題的爭辯聲，也就隨着山城的朝　消除了。</p>
<p>南京旣爲我國首都所在地，以一地方性的城市，而演進爲全國的政治中心，國際性的都市，中外觀瞻所繁，一切市政和建設，當然不能因　就簡。主席最注意的是首都的建設，六萬萬元的鉅款，一次撥給市工務局修建道路，主席於還都後更差不多每日出來巡視，市工務局在一星期中就奉到了二十條主席的手諭，那一處的路面要修，那一條馬路太窄，那一塊空地要造房屋，那一所房屋要拆除，那怕是最微小的事，主席都法意到了。南京是在主席的督導和市府與全市民的努力下，朝着一個目標前進，我相信不難在最　期　成功一個偉大的完美的現代化都市。</p>
<p>五五還都以後，南京整個城市都在蓬勃的生氣中，到處呈現着新的活力，沒有人再能記得起一個月前有人要把她遺棄。戰爭的遺跡，漸漸地被這種新的活力所冲淡了，現在南京你跑到任何一條馬路上，你總可以嗅到一陣一陣的汕漆氣和磚石泥土味。到處可以看到一車一車的磚石，木料·從你面前拖過，營造商一家一家的多起來，還是接應不暇。水木工人。油漆匠·電燈裝修工人從各地滙集到來，一天多似一天，還是忙不過來，南京正在建築狂中。</p>
<p>聰明的商人不肯輕於放過運個機會，他們很淸楚的看到未來南京的商業價値，他們很明白這龐大數量的中上級公務人員及他們的家屬，各地機關商行的駐京代表們，外國的使節貴賓，以及川流不息由各處來京接洽要公的各界人物，這些人都俱有强大的購買力，是他們的基本主顧，同時白下城郊媚美的玄武　，　靜的鷄鳴寺，清麗的燕子磯和莊嚴偉大的中山陵等名勝，將吸引千萬游衆，　齊廣闊的道路和路旁衆多的曠地，都是商業發展的優越條件，假使一旦京滬路舖設雙軔完成，每二小時有一班火車從上海到站，同時也有一班火車開出，那時南京的商業更要無限量的發展哩。</p>
<p>在戰後物資極度的缺乏下，政府對首都的建設，還是照預定計劃，按步就班的進行着，戰前會劃定下關中山北路以南，惠民河以西，揚子江以東，三汶河以北的地區，作爲第一工業區，並且已將通路隄防等都規劃就緒，但因戰爭的關係沒有實施，不過這一區域三面環水，幅員有限得很，總面積不過九百餘畝，實不足以適應今後的需要，所以最近的市政會議又通過，勘定揚子江草鞋峽·金陵鄉·老虎山·象山一帶地區闢作第二工業區，以便建立紡織·化學·食品等輕工業，因爲面臨長江，輪船可以直達，鐵路支綫亦可展築至區內，市府還準備將區內的幹路與市區內的幹路相啣接如　則水陸交通，無一不便。當這個計劃發表以後，工商界紛紛向市府詢問承租工業區土地的手續，和市府對該區工廠管理法則，負責工業區設計和建築的市府工務局張劍鳴局長和載中潞科長吿訴我，工業區的道路，下水這·抽水站·隄防·閘　等工程，一俟行政院核後即可動工，不出二年當可完成。</p>
<p>地理的形勢給予南京商業條件太優越了，假使漢口成爲我國重工業中心的話，那末南京無疑便是上海和漢口二大經濟貿易的中心站，假使京杭國道舖設鐵路成功，那末南京又成爲蘇浙皖三雀貨物的集散地，這些都是短期內必能實現的預言，南京將漸漸地因政治中心而進展到工業，商業中心</p>
<p>南京雖然自從還都以後人口激增，消費量增高，面出現了許多新商店，但整個金融界還是滯留在幼稚的階段中。如果要發展商業還需要外來的人力的援助，更希望上海過剩的游資，過剩的人才快退出「英雄末路」的投機市塲，共同來開發這塊荒凉的沃土，南京是在股切的期望着你們。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社西姆拉廿二日電〕印度回敎聯盟主席眞納，頃在此間發表談話，對於英內閣訪印團拒不接受回敎聯盟所主張之「巴基斯坦制」，表示失望。略謂巴基斯坦實乃解決印度憲法問題之唯一條件。英閣訪印團爲滿足國大會黨起見，竟至拒絕本黨要求，吾人當警吿英國政府，印度回敎徒在有其必要時，當以武力從事抵抗。茲特提出最低限度，要求三項如次：（一）將印度各省分爲兩個獨立集團，一爲同敎六有集團，一爲印度集團。（二）由印回兩集團組成聯邦，其權力以外交國防及交通爲限。（三）聯邦制以十年爲「啓蒙」，印回兩集團均保有退出之權利。</p>

<h3>吳市長痛下次心　懲治奸商第一聲！　米市場逮捕一人交五千萬舖保嚴加查究　治滬成績期以半載　甯得罪極多數人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長昨晚偕夫人出席清華同學會歡迎會，即席並發表重要演說，就食糧·工潮及市政三方面，作堅決而坦白之說明，茲將演詞大意誌次：</p>
<p>上海　地方情形，向極　複，本人出　重任，實應才識不足，因之對于施政方針，亦不欲多所說明，蓋惟恐異日不能兌現，徒令市民失望。然今日得與母校同學，歡聚一堂，實有不能已于言者，深知將來諸同學必能隨時隨地，賜予珍貴之建議也。</p>
<p>市政　最要之圖，為求內部組織之健全，然上海目前迫切問題，亟待解決者太多，本人遂不得不權衡輕重，捨彼就此。上海今日最重要之問題，為米糧，工潮，及市政效率，上海米價，于十日內自四萬餘飛漲出七萬大關，全奸商投機囤積所致。故本人于接事之前一日，即已對此考慮，星期一于九時接事，本人于八時半即已通知米商，召開緊急會議，上海米商存米有五十萬担，民間存米有三十萬担，即此總數十萬担，即足可敷全市三月之需，所謂青黃不接時期，本祇六七八三月，茍能渡過此三月，新榖登塲，米糧來源已無問題。在南京時，糧食部徐部長即告謂已向巴西定米九萬噸，且已在起運中，即使米源發生問題，祇須將此五十萬担拋售，至少巴西米即可到達上海，故上海食米萬無中斷之虞。本人深知雖已嚴令取締投機，而事實上奸商必仍于暗中活躍，故除令社會局派員于市塲監視外，市府亦密派幹員，切實注意，今日東即發現有人故意抬高市價，賣戶於五萬一千即肯脫售，而彼竟故意高呼願以五萬三千收進。當于下午三時，將此人逮捕，交五千萬元舖保，並調查其全部賬冊，如此人果係投機奸商者，當即藉此人以證明本人嚴懲操縱居奇之決心。彼等或仍視本人為老官僚作風，然本人旣受清華之敎育，復蒙國家派至外國讀書上，若再不拿出良心辦事，是對不起國家，對不起清華。</p>
<p>至于　工潮問題，情形實極嚴重。以前上海工廠之所以發達，實因工資奇廠之故，但目前工資之高，竟已超過美國。工人之福利固必須加以考慮，但決不能不秉同舟共濟之義，讀一　單而有效之辦法。詳細對策，現尙在考慮之中，然欲食鷄蛋者，當不能先將孵蛋之鷄殺死。工廠若皆不能生產，工人之福利便談不到矣。</p>
<p>其他　一般市政方面，本人深僱工部局辦事效率之高，我國於旣獲勝利之後，不特不應較彼等遜色，且應較彼等更見進步。惟上海情形複雜如此，欲求略有成績，至少需時半年，且非得罪多數人不可，然本人身受清華敎育，即拚命也要作去「得罪人我也不怕。」同學如手足，惟望每一同學，對市政若有意見，隨時見示，實所企望，</p>
<p>宴會日程　各界宴請市長表示歡迎者，每日皆有數起，現　排定日程如下：今日中午應徐士造律師之宴。二十五日下午五時半，將應阿根廷公使喬司阿斯之鷄尾酒會。二十六日上午十時參加戰笠將軍追悼會，七時半應澳洲公使之晚宴。二十七日六時出席美第七艦隊總司令柯克上將之鷄尾酒會。二十九日下午七時半，美駐華陸軍總司令吉倫中將於美軍官員俱樂部為吳市長設鷄尾酒會，以作洗塵。</p>
<h3>上海市黨部　增派四委員　毛子佩仍返原任</h3>
<p>中央當局，為加強滬市黨務，幸工作效能起見，擴充名額，加委毛子佩·陳寶驊·周學湘·酈奎等四人　為黨委，日內即將就職，毛民原屬黨委去歲因充任社會局第四處處長，無暇兼顧，故將黨委　云，茲因當局　　頗深，令其仍返舊任，以收駕　就黨之效。</p>
<h3>顧全平民區陸生　供應零售自來水</h3>
<p>公用局為顧全平民區人民健康起見，特訂定本市代理零售自來水辦法一種，凡本市各水廠管綫能到達之平民區域，民間如無自來水設備者，均可遴派代表，向該局索取辦法及申請書，申請裝置零售自來水龍頭，一經查實，當即裝接，由正當商民，依照定價代為經售，以利飲用而重公眾衛生。</p>
<h3>「背信」消費合作社　控訴行總</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據上海市消費合作社息：該社社息：前曾向「行總」申請購買平價麵粉五千包，每包六千元，當由「行總」財務廳函該社，向指定銀行付款領購。該社接到此項文件後，即認為「買賣契約成立，持款向銀行支付，依照定章換取棧單。詎「行總」催告，「行總」均置之不理。最近「行總」以三月廿一日奉諭停售為理由，不允履行交貨。該社認為「行總」事前旣延宕交貨，事後竟藉口奉諭停售，因此將以背信　約，控訴「行總」。</p>
<p>記者旋以此事聞諸「行總」某負責人，據稱：該社前曾向「行總」申請購粉，「行總」當函覆　照當時報紙所公布購粉辦法，至指定銀行繳款領購。該社並未於規定時間內繳款，迨繳款時，該項大量購買麵粉之辦法業已中止，「行總」當未便例外撥售。「行總」除覆函該社，通知購粉辦法外，並未與該社訂有任何買賣契約云。</p>

<h3>DDT　謹防假冒　拆穿西洋鏡　市上多假貨　號稱美裝害人不淺　化驗結果火油一瓶</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在鴿籠式房子裏生活着的上海人，一向吃夠了蚊子臭蟲跳蟲的虧，而今一旦聽到了具有殺蟲威力的DDT自美來華後，正是「搔　　處」，故立刻就受到大眾的歡迎。</p>
<p>金黃色美式啤酒瓶裝，黏貼着設計精美的商標，註明是美國某某藥廠的出品，又說含DDT的成份都在百分之十以上，一瓶瓶，一排排，光潔整齊，晶瑩奪目的堆滿了四川路，外灘，中正路，勞合路，亞爾培路，林森路，各處專賣「美式配備」的小攤上。烟紙店和小藥房，也未日落後的湊着熱鬧。價錢每寔自一千八百元到二千五百元，更有加送噴射器的。上海人殺蟲心切，又酷嗜噱頭，少不了人手一瓶，DDT於是利市百倍，風行一時。</p>
<p>可是，聰明的上海人，你到底是受騙了！因為記者曾在各處選購了十種DDT的樣品，送　專家化騐結果，發覺這批自命是美貨的DDT，十瓶倒有九瓶是鼎貴。有的簡直是清火油，偶有一二瓶含有DDT的，其成份也不過在百分之三左右。至於那些美國廠名，更多是杜撰的，有的簡直　拚法和文法也錯了。而眞正美貨DDT的粉　　劑，供應市面的還不多，甚至官方機關還感　乏，談何普遍市銷售！</p>
<p>詰又得說回來，上海人聽多了關於DDT的宣傳，只知道它殺蟲的能力是如何大，却還不知它的底細怎樣，難怪要一窩蜂的大上其當。記者在這裏要提供幾點關於DDT的常識，給讀者參考。</p>
<p>DDT常識誌</p>
<p>第一純粹的DDT粉，是很難溶解的。就是在火油中，充其量也只能溶解百分之五。一般假貨自稱含量百分之十，都是虛偽的宣傳。</p>
<p>第二，DDT本身無色無味，所以它的溶解液，單憑眼鼻是無法鑑別的，除非送請專家化騐。</p>
<p>第三，DDT不能即刻致昆虫於死命，但是昆虫一經與DDT接觸，就會中毒，然後麻痹致死。蒼蠅和蚊子，大約半小時內斃命。臭虫大约要数小时才死，蟑螂大约要一星期才會死。</p>
<p>但是，DDT最大功效，就是它殺虫的駐在力是很長久。最好的DDT，殺虫力可維延到六個月左右，DDT對人類雖無害，但食物和菜疏，最好初以DDT噴射。特別是液劑的DDT，千萬不能在火爐灶頭附近噴射，以免引起炎災。</p>
<p>那末，眞正的DDT，本市果然會沒有麼？那也不盡然。好在有幾家國人自辦的聞名新藥廠，也在仿製。根據化騐結果，效騐也很不錯。聰明的上海人，請不必過份迷信那批自命是美貨的DDT，倒是這批國產的DDT，多少還有些DDT的效騐和成份。你要不上當，那末贖買時請認明商標吧。（圖示街攤和烟兌店販賣DDT情形，本報俞創碩攝）</p>
<h3>僞造者　將予嚴懲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來市上發現有假冒DDT之藥品出售，據衛生局食物藥品檢騐所負責人語記者稱：新出藥品，不論任何各類，均應向衛生局登記，現充斥市上之DDT，有百餘種之多，均未正式登記，根本違反規例，至假冒及渝工減料以欺騙市民者，更將予以嚴格取締。DDT係外用藥，危險性尙較小，至市上有若干假冒內服藥出售者，其貽害市民，實匪淺鮮，一方面固將取締一方面亦望市民注意。</p>
<p>現該所已由衛生局醫藥行政處交來在市上商店及小攤上購得之DDT十種，予以化騐，俟一星期後檢騐完畢即將報告當局，如屬假冒將正式向法庭起訴或會同警察局究辦。其他各種DDT均將一一抽查檢騐，以免不正當商人危害民眾。</p>
<h3>美海軍登陸艇一批　奉命移交招商局　昨今兩天共計接收四艘　將行駛沿海及長江各綫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美海軍有登陸艇一批，計LSM十五艘，LST十艘，奉命移交與招商局，該局昨已奉令行將LSM一一二及二四八號兩艘接收。事先船務處通告，規定接收程序。（一）午後（昨日）半點鐘，各船長在本局（即招商局）五〇三號餐室午膳。（二）一時半出發，一一二號之船員，集中飛滬小輪。二四八號之船員，集中國本小輪。（三）先接收一一二號，後接收二四八號。（四）一點五十五分美軍在一一二號船上，宣讀移交命令，二點本局代表宣讀接收命令，同時更調國旗。（五）接收完畢後，再接收二四八號，同樣辦理。（六）明日（即今日）接收LST。亦係同樣程序。計八〇四·九二九號兩駿，均由船務處長黃慕宗親自主持。一一二號現改名華一〇一號，船長沈驥春，大副呂升奮，二副黃震春，二四八號改名華一〇二號，船長襲丕勳，大副張燕鐸，二副黃朝佑。九二九號船陸孝敏。大副施廷槐。二副薩師洪。該項登陸艇計LSM十五艘，均係一千餘噸。派駛長江綫。LST十艘。約三餘噸。派駛沿海綫。該局前奉令察者在小呂宋之美登陸艇。曾派嚴洪福前往，現有來電報告詳情未悉，據聞各艇散泊各埠，察看頗費時日，短期內尙不能返滬。</p>
<h3>非常時期所訂稅則　胡西園談應予廢止　稅收標準尤須注意公允</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者為本市工商界請求政府廢止非常時期所訂各項稅則，又豁免卅四年度各項非常稅收事，昨特趨訪本市工商界領袖亞浦耳電氣廠總經胡西園，叩詢對此事之意見。承告非常時期所訂各項稅由，原為增加戰時性質之法令，自本年度起，當應隨以廢止。至卅四年度各項非常稅收之豁免事宜，胡氏自　來滬僅二月，對光復區之財政情形，未盡明瞭，惟以後方工商界而言，則去年度對政府各項非常時期之稅收，一部份均已繳付，且去年度戰事延至八月間，始告平息，大部份仍屬非常時期，故對政府開征去年度之各項非常稅收，原則上無可非議。至光　區或因情形複雜，而請求豁免，則係特殊例外，胡氏對此未獲發表意見。至於簡化稽征問題，胡氏主張盡力求無聲。例如　陪都期間，當局常以上年度之　虧，以為估計本年度稅收之標準，似欠公允，又佔價時應有同業公會多數代表參加，多多提供意見，俾使估價公允。對直接稅局出　調查員之操守，更應切實注意廉潔。　發現有舞弊情事，應予　嚴處置，同時應儘量接受被害人據實密報，而不公布被害人之姓名。</p>

<p>廣東開平人，卅七歲，曾留學日本，畢業於東京帝國大學經濟系。車與巨奸陳君　相識，乃於民國廿九年參加僞組織，先後充任僞經濟委員會秘書及駐滬辦事處主任，僞建設部駐滬辦事處主任，僞實業部物價鑒定長及僞上海商品檢騐局局長，迄勝利為止。據其供稱：「我說來眞慚愧，當初一時不愼，被人拉下水，雖則不是為了升官發財，祇是為了生活，但自己總覺得對不住良心，所以自願受法律制裁」。法官即斥道：「你以公費留學多年，歸國後參加僞政府，於心何忍！」勞即供稱：「留日歸國後，即赴香港開書店，營業不佳，蝕本關門，乃來上海。」嗣經法官詢問其廠工作，一一回供不誤，乃諭改期再訊。</p>

<p>王根元</p>
<p>戚墅堰機工廠之貨車小工，曾於卅三年七月充任僞戚墅堰車站管路警，勒索員工行旅，惡劣萬分，勝利後為該處員工聯合檢舉，然被告對其所犯罪行，拒不承認。以上三案，亦經詳詢一過，改期再訊，被告還押．</p>

<h3>全市學生定期發動　尊師勸募運動　私校敎師請發尊師金</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕市敎育局，前曾聯絡各界領袖，發起尊師運動，逾月以來，雖有相當成績，惟距目標尙遠，爰再發動本市大中學生勸募運動。茲定本月廿七，廿八兩日，自上午八時，至下午六時，由學生勸募隊向各商店勸募。其辦法，每校至少一隊，每隊四組，每組四人，分任捐册捐款收據等職。捐款彙集後，由敎育局償還銀行借款，及撥助市校敎師，與若干極困苦之私校敎師。並聞本市私校師生，亦熱忱參加，以發揚親愛互助之精神。各校長定於今明二日內，親赴敎育局領取捐冊收據等件云。</p>
<p>〔另訊〕本市小學敎師聯合進條會等三團體全體會員，近見報載市校敎師每人先支尊師助金四萬元，對於私校敎師，並未提及，與前次局長所云：「市校發給第二次補助金或尊師金時，私校敎師得有同等待遇」之諾言，未相符合，請求該團體等推派代表葛志成，王魯之等，携帶呈文，晋謁局長，有所詢問。適局長公出，由朱處長代爲接見。當代表提出詢問時，朱處長即答以此次市校先支尊師金，係根據各該校自外捐得之尊師金多寡爲標準，其數量最多者爲四萬元，最少亦有五千元者。至於外間普通募得之尊師金，並未動用，且以後尊師運動結束時，該項尊師金，均須平均分配，給公私校敎師，而且前市校所發之數亦當扣除云。</p>

<h3>美國新發明盲人寫字機</h3>
<p>每分鐘可寫一百四十字</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處波士頓廿二日電〕基督敎科學箴言報最近戰稱。加州聖狄埃哥之彭十克斯博士已發明一種袖珍型之盲人寫字機，盲人經過訓練後，用此寫字機，每分鐘能筆錄一百四十字。箴言報稱：此種盲人寫字機準備大量製造，每一架之重量僅十八盎斯，可藏在男子之大衣袋內，或婦女之皮夾內，並配有狹帶，足敷數小時筆錄之用，彭克斯博士稱：美國國內最少有盲人七萬二千名，渠估計其中有六萬人能學習使用此種盲人寫字機。渠並報吿：此項新發明雖未大事宣傳，但已收到來自英國與南美洲各界之書信一千封以上，準備訂購此項寫字機。</p>
<h3>國立臺灣大學</h3>
<p>— 楊乃藩</p>
<p>國立台灣大學的前身，是日本統治台灣時代的台北帝國大學。成立迄今，已有四十餘年的歷史，因爲日本把台灣視作南進的根據地，而台大又是硏究南進政策的大本營，所以日人對於合大的經營，不遺餘力，其敎授都是日本國內第一流的專家，其校舍有規模偉大的洋房二十餘座，其圖書館有藏書五十餘萬册，其他機械設備標本儀器等，也是內容充實，爲我國各大學所遠不及。而所屬之南方資源硏究所，熱帶科學研究所，南方語文硏究所等機關，在配合日人南進政策的立塲看來，尤爲該校的特色。</p>
<p>該校共分文·法·理·農·工·醫六學院，除了醫學院在合北中心區的東門町外，其餘各部門都在近郊的水道町。在過去，學生總數一千二百餘人，台灣籍的學生不到二百人，而且這二百人中，一百五十人以上是醫學院生，只有少數分配在農工各學院，因爲日本人是不許台灣人研究高深的學術的。現在，日本籍的學生都已遣送回去，所留下來的學生，除了醫學院外，其他各院合計不過二十九名，敎授們因爲國內來的人很少，不能不把日人留下來。這樣一個設備完整，規模宏大的學校，却沒有學生，沒有敎員，眞是奇蹟。</p>
<p>台灣大學在戰事的未期，也曾遭遇嚴重的轟炸，全部校會的玻璃窗已經全毁，房屋洞穿的也有，破漏的也有。加以日人投降以後，我政府接收以前所產生的混亂現象，校具，儀器，標本等的損失是相當大的。而宵小的偸竊，也頗爲嚴重，我們看到有幾個大櫉，陳列着動物骨骼的標本，都是異常珍貴的，管理的日籍人員因爲無怯照顧，在櫉旁貼了一張紙條，大意是：樹內物件在市塌上不能賣錢，務請諸君不必携去。這又該是奇蹟了。</p>
<p>台灣過去的學制，中學只有四年，要升入大學，尙須補讀兩年，所以台大成立了一個先修班，現在有學生四百九十二人。</p>
<p>台灣的風物美麗，生活安定，台灣大學又有很好的設備，同時，光復後的台灣，正需要大量的人才來建設。上海的許多有志靑年，如果有志向外發展的話，那末在暑假中，設法投考台灣大學，倒是一條很好的出路呢。</p>

<p>對尊師運動建議</p>
<p>編輯先生：本市熱心人士，以近來生活艱困，各校敎師待遇菲薄，爰有敬師尊師運動等組織，向各界募集款項，以謀敎師生活之改善，俾執敎者能安於職位，學生得受優良敎導，際茲國家財政支絀期間，我輩份屬國民，自當樂於捐助，以觀其成。有兩茲點意見：一爲募款單位似太複雜，昨日部人約友在某茶室遇有某私立女校學生前來募款，所掣收據，印刷模糊，塡數草率，（鉛筆書寫根不留底）明知來者皆熱心學子，但總覺手續過嫌簡單，難免使人懷疑。一爲各私立學校正在徵收第二期學雜等費，昨據小兒女報告，全校中竟有百分之七八小朋友以家境淸貧，無法籌　，以致半途輟學。對於第一點　人事問題，但結果至少有礙募款成績，影響敎師收益，第二點誠爲社會問題，竊思上海一隅，私立學校甚多，如小兒輩就讀同樣情形之學校，必不在少，學齡兒童而逍中途失學，豈不太覺可憐，素仰先生服務社會，熱心公益，對於此點務望登高一呼，請本市敎育當局或各界樂善好施之人士，作切實有效之援助，至少限度應請各私立學校當局對於此等無力繳付第二期學費之學生，予以特別通融，繼續入學，學生幸甚，社會幸甚。此請撰安　來鼎銓手上</p>

<p>外幣美鈔形勢平庸，開後金市回落，遂目二四二〇元逐漸微挫至二三八〇元左右，入後進退於二三九〇元至二四〇〇元間，局勢極形穩定，午後被金市帶小少許，結果較前日下跌五十元，港票亦下降五元，港電四三五元，羅比五三五元，均有供給，美滙掛牌仍平，指定銀行賣價二千一，結者亦不多。</p>
<h3>空領陸續補進公債局勢復堅</h3>

<h3>人造絲價提高</h3>
<p>廠經綢貨又轉跌</p>
<p>昨日人造絲市上午堅穩，下午又吿上騰，一二〇號天橋首先開盤一百四十三萬元，迄收盤無甚變化，下週因上週六中紡公司所開之貨，大都無箱非原包貨，以是市價一致提高，天橋喊價一百四十七八萬元，較上日漲起七八萬元，其餘各號貨亦均帶起，只一五〇雜牌有光價不振，上午做廿三萬元，下午做廿五萬元，廠絲八十三分高勻度喊價二百六十萬元，七十八分高勻度二百四十萬元有成交，其餘各檔用戶絲及干經俱短十萬元左右，綢貨市價亦短，美亞被面每百條小二萬元，大誠格子璧縐上午每碼做四千〇五十元，下午做價三千九百六十元，較隔日小一百四五十元。</p>
<h3>婺源抽貢居奇</h3>
<p>婺源陳抽貢，印度孟買對於品質高尙者，頗有需要，故連日本市各白頭行家均有進意，但執貨者以市存將罄，莫不居爲奇貨，以致供應漸趨減落，交易難成，形勢甚俏，至於內銷花色，天津帮活動寥寥，然本街店莊及蘇錫等地之去化，迄未趨餒，情况因進出雙方頗爲平和，是以尙能保持穩定。</p>
<h3>現貨供不敷求　紗綫一致上漲</h3>
<p>昨日紗市頗爲挺秀，緣津帮去胃轉暢，本街門銷亦旺，故各支紗的漲一二萬之譜，四十二支雙綫因上日紡建公司只賣廠家，對紗業同行絲毫未予供給，致綫價又高三五萬，按目下紗市雖無大宗客銷，然現貨供應仍屬不敷，在各路陸續小額採辦下，廿支現貨常吿缺乏，故業中人預料將來如遇各路航運暢通時，紗價恐有驚人之發展。</p>
<p>花市紐約美棉大漲廿二至廿九磅音，計近期美金二七·六〇，遠期二八·二四，米特林現貨二八·二一，本埠現棉市况尙堅，惟交易稍减色，計申新六廠進巴西花及烏拉圭花，大生廠進彭家坡花蘇綸進白洛去等花云。</p>
<h3>糖價繼續回小</h3>

<p>進出口銀行大批工貸</p>
<p>戰後美國工商界對我國市塲，均予深切注意，並擬來華投資，設規模較大之工廠。聞將與我方訂立合同者，計有電器工廠，石油公司，化學品製造業，輪船製造公司等，並由美國進出口貸易銀行貸予工業貸款五億六千六百萬美元爲資金，其中一部份貸款並由美方代購各種器材，聞今後美國尙有大公司三百餘家，來華集體投資。</p>
<h3>游資傾向大熱　華洋股漲多跌少</h3>
<p>華股有金融界向大熱落手，業中空頭被迫抵補，永紗最高價五三五〇元，美亞四二五〇元，而後稍回，小股因游資傾向大熱，情形反吿冷淡，景福最爲遜色，新光勤興高價雖難支持，但以套買有人，形勢較景福爲佳，午收較前收計永紗美亞各漲半成，景福微跌，新光勤興前者漲半成，後者微升，中型各股亦回升少許，元老股仍乏生氣，外股有債市大戶移師而來，突呈爭買，怡紗晨開即躍升爲三五〇〇元左右，中途喊高百餘元而後稍稍回落，結果二大熱怡紗美聯各升一成，小股除紙業業廣亦漲一成外，餘均漲起有限。</p>

<h3>甘肅汽油增產</h3>
<p>半年內達二百萬加侖</p>
<p>甘肅油礦爲國內經營最佳者，據統計共有鑽井六十一口，其中正在產油者十三口，原油生產能力頗高，惟汽油產魚仍受運翰限制，鐵上存油甚豐，　器有限，不能充分發揮，品質方面，則有顯著　步，辛　值已提高至二十五度，行車效率遠較酒精為高，而價格則低於酒精，據統計半年內可產汽油二百萬加侖，至於新疆烏蘇油礦，亦積極進行生產云</p>
<h3>中美合作　東成辦汽車廠</h3>

<h3>地方銀行不准在滬設分支行</h3>
<p>關於各省省銀行或地方銀行，不准在京滬設立分支行或辦事處事，聞因各省地方銀行，事實上無在滬設立之必要，且爲各該省金融業務前途計，各省地方銀行應在本省謀發展，故浙江地方銀行上海分行已遵令結束，至於江蘇及蘇省農民兩行，因京滬兩地原屬江蘇，故可在京滬設立，聞京滬兩地已開業之各省地方銀行，均已奉令結束，或改爲通訊處，唯台灣銀行上海分行，係由財部特准設立。</p>
<h3>棉布市況已好轉</h3>
<p>棉布因閩粤蜀漢等處對於嗶嘰漂布直貢呢皆有採買，津帮在最近期間，坯布納胃頗强，對於十二磅三A彩球布搜羅尤力，次之則十二磅五福藍鷄，細布銷路殊夥，所以坯布情况愈形挺秀，據市塲云，軍裝需布尤旺，已向大公司訂購坯布數量相當可觀，中紡公司今日掛牌十二磅細布僅藍雞藍V字紅V字三牌，龍頭彩球陽鶴未見掛牌應市，且購買分配之數量大都減少，十二磅藍鷄均照墊單數量對折分配，頭馬漂布登記號家僅一百二十號至一百七十號可得，其他均無分配，所以午後市塲續挺，因紡建公司配貨稀少，坯布市象更昻云。</p>
<h3>英國猪鬃不敷應用　供應部削減用量天津出口貨略動</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕英國鬃刷製造業公會，最近召開年會，曾論及猪鬃之供應問題，該年曾稱：各鬃刷製造商對近頃供應部採取之猪鬃用量削减措施，咸感過於嚴峻，又去歲供應部會冀將存於重慶之一批貨色極佳之猪鬃，空運印度，惟以該時空運停止，未克實現，目下若改用航輪運至長江下游，又以安全爲慮，迄未獲得結果。</p>
<p>該公會復一致通過，促請供應部公佈所有猪鬃之存量，期能獲得有關價格等問題之寳貴資料，現該公會已成立諮詢委員會，俾與供運部取得充分聯絡，又聞該部曾以一磅又八分之五售價，拋售南美猪鬃，供予製造鞋刷爐灶刷之用，惟猪鬃鑑別委員會，對此並不重視。</p>

<p>〔南昌通信〕中央於去年規定，在贛採購餘糧二百萬擔，濟運長江下游，惟因本省在八年抗戰之後，農村殘破，生產銳減，食糧亦感恐慌，而採購價與市面價格，又相差太遠，故各縣採購迄無成數，後經請准減爲五十萬擔，限五月底交齊，王主席此次晋京，蔣主席以軍精俘糧，關係重要，面諭如限交足，王氏於十六日由廬山返省，對於此事，極爲重視，除電承辦之豐城等四十餘縣，如限購足外，並將加强運輸機構，集中九江交貨，聞刻已購到十七萬擔，其餘則因木省各地穀價，均在五千元到九千元之間，而且正値春荒嚴重之時，故採辦仍極艱困，聞中央爲體恤民艱起見，有提高採價之意。</p>
<p>與本省毘連之湘粤兩省，糧荒均極嚴重，本省田糧處，曾奉令撥濟湘省食米廿萬擔，粤省十萬擔，聞省處已指定湘在德興蓮花安福等縣購十萬擔，粤在黎川等地購五萬擔，以資救濟。</p>

<h3>世界第二次　大戰損失　最近凖確　統計　死傷率：蘇聯最慘重·中国佔第五位</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特稿</p>
<p>人類愈進步，互相殘殺的本領愈高强。在第二次世界大戰中，各交戰國勾心鬥角，新式殺人武器層出不窮，於是人類遭到了歷史上空前的浩刦。在疆塲上陣亡的將士，被轟炸傷亡的軍民，這匪軍屠殺的老百姓，被敵人迫害的愛國志士，以及流亡離散，凍餒貧病的人們……無論東西南北，大國小邦，都不免遭遇到同樣的命運。戰火所至，廬舍爲墟，屍骨遍野，血流成渠，生命財產，人力物力的損失，不可勝數。這眞是人類的莫大損失。</p>
<h3>人口損失總額超出五千萬人</h3>
<p>據美國「紐約世界電訊」報最近出版的「一九四六年世界年鑑」所發表的統計數字，第二次世界大戰各國死亡，受傷，失踪，被俘的軍民，總計在五千萬人以上。這是就各國政府公報，情報局的記錄，半官性質的出版物，戰時救濟機關和報紙的記載加以編造的，此外沒有記錄的死亡人數，當亦不在少數。茲將各國死亡，失踪，及被俘人數，列成「第一表」。</p>
<p>我們可以從「第一表」看出：死傷人數最多的是蘇聯，死於對德戰爭的人數，估計在一千二百萬至一千五百萬之間，軍民各佔半數，該表所列數字是折中數。其次是波蘭，共計一〇，〇四五，〇〇〇人，其中一百零四萬五十是軍人，九百萬是平民，其中五百萬人（內三萬人是猶太人）是在佔領時期被殺害的。再其次是德國，計九百九十萬人。我們由此可以想見德蘇戰事的慘烈，尤其是希魔治下德國人殺人不眨眼的殘暴性格。</p>
<p>死傷率第四位輪到日本，海陸軍死傷總數共計五，〇八六，二七八人，平民尙不計在內。日本軍隊中因醫藥缺乏及營養不足，致士兵多患疾病，總計在四百四十七萬人以上，其中至少四萬餘人因病死亡。據一九四五年八月二十三日東京當局發表公報：日本四十四個城市，幾乎完全毁滅，死傷及無家可歸的平民，的計一千萬人，其中死亡人數計二十六萬，內九萬人死於廣島及長崎的原子炸彈。受傷人數計四十一萬二千人，內受傷於原子炸彈者計十八萬人。全部毁壞的房屋，計二百二十一萬幢，局部被毁壞的房屋計九萬幢，無家可歸的人民計九百二十萬人。</p>
<p>中國的死傷率列於第五位。據一九四五年九月二十八日中國陸軍總司令何應欽將軍報吿：中國抗戰八年，官兵死亡的在一百八十萬人以上，其餘受傷及失踪的計一百七十萬人。</p>
<h3>船艦全部損失四千七百餘艘</h3>
<p>根據美國海軍部及英國海軍部於一九四五年六月十三日公佈的數字：第二次世界大戰中，聯合國和中立國所損失的船艦，共計四千七百七十艘，噸位總計二一，一四〇，〇〇〇噸。美國在海戰中直接損失的船艦，計五百七十艘，因海上意外損失的船艦，計九百八十四艘，美國商船船員死亡，失踪及被俘的計六千零六十六人。在一九三九年九月三日至一九四五年五月八日止之期間，英國喪失船艦二千五百七十艘，（計一一，三八〇，〇〇〇噸）。美國喪失五百三十八艘，（計三，三一〇，〇〇〇噸）。其他聯合國喪失一千一百七十二艘，（計五，〇三〇，〇〇〇噸）。中立國喪失四百九十艘，（計一，四二〇，〇〇〇噸）。</p>
<p>芬蘭。匈牙利·義大利及日本損失的船艦，包括於各該國與英美交戰以前的中立國總數內，但交戰以後受敵國控制的船艦並不列入。實際上的損失數目，並不祗此，因德國在佔領國內奪佔的船艦並未列入，此外陸軍或海軍現充軍役的補助艦亦未列入。</p>
<p>茲將美國海軍部及英國海軍部所公佈的聯合國及中立國船艦損失統計數字，列成「第二表」。</p>
<p>又據另一統計：第二次世界大戰中，美國共損失船艦六百九十六艘，英國共損失七百三十艘，英國自治領共損失四十六艘，日本共損失六百八十四艘。在戰事結束時，日本尙存戰艦五百三十三艘。據一九四五年六月十日英美共同發的報吿，在火西洋　役，聯合國共擊毁德國潛水艇七百十三艘。</p>
<p>日本在二次大戰中損失的商船，總計六百十三萬噸，列成「第三表」。</p>
<p>（第三表　日本損失商船統計</p>
<h3>英美擲彈噸數二百七十萬噸</h3>
<p>第二次世界大戰中美國及英國空軍活動及損失實情列成「第四表」。</p>
<p>據美國空軍報吿：太平洋戰爭中所投擲之炸彈，總計五〇二，七八一噸，擊毀敵機七，三六二架，損失飛機四，五三〇架。</p>
<p>據一九四五年九月五日日本政府發言人發表談話稱：太平洋戰爭中日本損失飛機五一，一〇九架。日本陸軍共建築飛機三二，五〇〇架，在戰爭中損失二五，五〇〇架。日本海軍共建築飛機三〇，二九五架，在戰爭中損失二五，六〇九架。換習之，日本所有飛機六二，七九五架中損失五一，一〇九架。</p>

<h3>長春廿九天</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者邵愼之</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>是否突圍之議未決，一部共軍已經由中央銀行西北方摸進，憑着一帶起伏地，衝進後門來。這是下午五時，守軍的陣地已轉到了中央銀行後門口，機關槍對外射擊，那聲音彷彿就在房門外面。副司令劉德溥率領了一百多人衝出去，把返近的共軍消滅了。只聽槍聲越打越遠。由於劉德溥的攻擊順利，於是最後作突圍的決定。</p>
<p>但戰事還在進行，這時在東拓附近有共軍一個連舉槍投降，因爲子彈打完了，報吿過來問如何辦理。後來不知如何辦理了。</p>
<p>突圍開始，可是共軍已用火網封鎖住，首先衝出去的幾個都倒在地上，愼之就進入更下一層的保險庫房，預計突圍的可能已經很小。這塲慘劃他居然看到最後。</p>
<p>一部份打開了正門出去，可是正門是轉門，非常狹小，於是打碎玻璃一個一個跳出去，後面排着隊，把營業部擠滿了，費很多時候，四五百人一下子怎麼跑得完。</p>
<p>陳家珍和代吉林省政府主席王寗華以及許多文職人員都打東側門出去的。愼之坐在保險庫房裏睡覺，他自信安全。同處還有三位中長鐵路的職員，他們昨天到中行來辦事，結果亦只好躱在這裏，聽候作「俘虜」，連呼倒霉不止。</p>
<p>六次搜查「俘虜」</p>
<p>四個人坐在保險庫房的通道中間，聽到外面槍聲逐漸稀落。到九點多鐘，一陣脚步聲，跑進庫房來，到庫房去的路是一條很彎曲的路，搞得不好還會迷路。一位中長職員上前招呼，看見果是共軍，而且兇狠，一臉油光，他一看四人都是便衣，問你們是那裏的？回答說是中長公司職員。於是混身一摸，檢査有沒有武器。這是第一次搜査。</p>
<p>幾個共軍以爲是俘虜，要愼之等四人跟着他們走，自然只好跟着他們走，因爲他們有槍，他的理就比你强。</p>
<p>臨走時又檢査，不過換了一個，看有無武器。這是第二次。</p>
<p>走出大門，只見市政府一片大火，火舌燎天，地上死屍橫陳，這時無暇細顧，共軍俘虜了的百來個保安隊已站好了隊，要我們站在一起，然後開步走。郊區的槍砲聲還是很密集，可能是突圍的一部份已打出去了。四個人跟着跑，到警察廳後面空地上集合，不知是什麼把戲了。等了一四，只見一個共軍手持手槍，跑過來說道：「把你們的手錶拿出來」。</p>
<p>愼之試着同他講道理，但沒有用，那位共軍說道：「你已經是俘虜，你們知道不知道？」不知道又怎樣呢？槍已對準胸口。反正是從手上拉下來。這是第三次搜査。</p>
<p>下一個節目又是跟着走，經過白山公園，經過鐵網，屍體和沙包的障碍，到同治路，再轉興仁大街，到滿淡門口馬路上站住。滿炭門口馬路上早坐着一大堆人，都是便衣，在月光底下，一個個都是蓬頭跣足，面目浮腫蒼白，四面圍着刺刀。四個人這時又和保安隊分開，也四面圍以刺刀。一個安徽口音的脚色，正嘶破了喉嚨，正在向坐着的一大堆穿便衣的致訓道：「……國民黨丢了東北不犯罪，你們四百個東北同胞倒犯罪？」原來坐在地上聽訓的是監獄裏放出來的罪犯。那安徽口音縱續說：「趙君邁丢了衡陽，國民黨不辦他，他不犯罪，現在又派到長春來做市長，你們答應不答應？現在你們解放了，願意回家的回家，願意留在這裏作事的就留在這裏。」</p>
<p>這位先生從九一八事變一直扯到民選政府，足足扯了一個半小時，這些犯人們在刺刀護衛下大拍其掌，自然是讚成佩服之至的意思，不佩服會拍手嗎？</p>
<p>另外較遠處的一堆是對俘虜致訓，也只聽見拍手，但是說了些什麽高明的意思却無從知悉。月亮在南方昇起，又大又圓。雖然是四月，晚風仍森冷刺骨。四人都失去了錶，不知什麼時候，大約是深夜十二時。</p>
<p>忽然又叫四個人跟着走，這時俘虜犯人攪成一團，一起趕進滿炭大樓旁邊的紅卍字會，在人羣裏，愼之又被一位共軍搜査武器，這下子把照相機拿去了，一面還說：「這東西放在你身邊還不方便。」這是第四次搜査。</p>
<p>五六百人一湧而進，一律上樓，混亂極了，一個共軍吹叫了命令大家休息，愼之等四人拖到幾把椅子，就坐下來打磕睡，大家十分疲倦，坐下來就睡着，睡到半路裏就被一位共軍叫醒，說有事情，睜眼一看，一屋子地板桌子窗檻上都睡滿了人，像蛆虫一樣，簡直連插脚的地方也沒有。四個人總算費盡九牛二虎之力跑到樓梯旁，一個一個噢進房間去檢査。問名字，三個中長公司的職員，各人拿出服務證件，雙手恭呈「人民的軍隊」之後，一對照片，完全不錯，但還要搜査，翻開所有的口袋三位朋友失去的東西大致相同：鋼筆，錢，刀，剪指甲刀，襯衣，短褲之類。愼之則在此一役中，從衣袋裏掏去鋼筆一枝，襯衣一件，短褲一條，襪子兩雙，剃刀一柄，還有流通券五千元也頗有拿去之意，這時慎之向「人民的軍隊」民主起來了，發表意見，說道：</p>
<p>「聽說你們八路軍是不要錢的，是嗎？」</p>
<p>「放心，不要拿你的，你拿回去。」</p>
<p>可是搜査究畢，走出門來，就尾來一位共軍，伸過手來說：</p>
<p>「你把錢拿給我。」</p>
<p>怎麽樣？自然拿給他，但問了他一句：「你能讓我離開這裏嗎？」回答說：「看吧。」民主的手是向上舉，他這一隻手是向下伸。他是八路軍，愼之並沒有說他是中央日報記者，只說是申報記者，並且拿出證件來給他們看。這是第五次搜査。</p>
<p>四個人回來仍坐在椅子上，胡亂磕睡下來，睡不多久，天色已曙，共軍就絡繹不絕而來，看俘虜身上有什麽合　的東西，大半是取鞋子皮帶。因此有許多俘虜光着脚板走路，但天氣太冷，熬受不住，用綁腿來裹脚，這事輪到愼之身上來了，在他磕睡中，一位共軍拿起他的脚來審視，愼之說：「除非用槍打死我，吾則你不能拿去。」這位共軍頗覺難爲情，不做一聲就溜掉了。這是第六次搜查。</p>
<p>愼之等四人寫了一個條子，交給共軍，要見他們的司令員。答應轉去，但是五個鐘頭後沒有答覆。中午的時候，犯人。俘虜，分批的走了。一座樓走空，只剩愼之等四人。半小時，那位拿去五千元的脚色走過來說：「你們還不走嗎？」另一個共軍說：「你們爲什麼和剛才走的人一起跑。」那一位糾正他：「他們四個不是俘虜。」</p>
<p>這不知是什麼意恩。四個人站起來就跑，也沒有人攔阻，跑出紅卍字會大門，向興仁大路西邊走去。</p>
<p>愼之不立刻走回寓所，仍走同治街，繞到中央銀行去看看，路上只有日本人，自由自在的走着，市政府的火還沒有熄，中央銀行後面還在冒烟。街上共軍不多，愼之獨自走回寓所，門口有一個共軍在守門，並不攔阻，洗過一個臉，立刻脫下衣服睡覺，週身疲乏，彷彿做了一塲特別打武做工戲。</p>
<h3>龍井訪茶</h3>
<p>龍井茶最昂貴的一種，稱爲「明前」。在杭州茶葉舖子，賣價是三千元一兩，四萬八千元一斤。據杭州北高峯山眞正出產龍井茶的獅半脚下聖壽寺務本法師見吿，這還）跟不上米價。戰前龍井「明前」茶價是十六元一斤，合米價兩擔，目前杭州米價五萬，等於茶價跌落一半。</p>
<p>聖壽寺內有一塊老龍井碑，刻在池岩上。廟前一塊矮茶林，務本和尙說：「這就是有名的「龍井古茶十八株」。南宋開山皇帝康王時代所植」，（我不大相信這麽久遠的光陰還能留下南宋的植物），務本和尙在老龍井池岩前一小亭中向我談茶二小時。杭郊龍虎獅雲四峯所出之茶均稱龍井茶，四峯中以獅峯茶最好，之江大學法籍敎授硏究原因是獅峯土質含鐵錳質多，爲白沙土·餘峯爲黃沙土·故差於獅峯，日前獅峯茶之大半　中國銀行投資經辦的獅峯茶葉公　　　摘焙，出品均爲銀行自己同仁分　大半，小數應市。他的聖壽寺種了小半，每年淸明節前，即雇用蕭山茶女茶童，　後即在山間摘葉，在廟內焙葉。市上所售「明前」　他認爲是不可能，原因是淸明前茶剛吐芽，芽嫩且濕度大，不能製成，一般號稱「叫前」，實在是「明後」摘下製成，亦可謂「雨前」茶。</p>
<p>這位老和尙在八年離亂中始終未走出過龍井茶區，守養這所廟，目擊山中滄桑，他說八年中茶山摘葉則年年有人手，除草驅蟲則無人下手，以致今日山徑兩旁茶樹與蔓草昆蟲互結姻緣，茶葉已不如八年前鮮嫩。</p>
<p>我由雲林寺經三天竺，爬至北高峯過山的缺嶺下至龍井谷底，一談快至日西斜，才由龍井谷底由務本派一茶童引我出山奔九溪十八澗源頭，沿路採茶女頭戴斗笠，身穿破藍布衫，腰繫漁郞裝魚式的茶簍，坐於自帶小木凳上在綠茶樹叢裏一片一片摘葉，我曾累次停脚詢以工價，她們說：「二十元一兩，三百二十元一斤」。</p>
<p>「一天可摘幾斤？」</p>
<p>「一天摘得四五斤鮮葉。」</p>
<p>他們大多是蕭山縣人，到茶季渡錢江北來，做山中摘茶季工，每月收人不過三四萬元，過此茶季依然回至蕭山家中，仍作村姑務農，在這日晒雨淋的摘茶工作上，他們自己容或有桑間陌上浪漫傳奇演出，但工作辛苦與收入菲薄鼓不起山中茶歌的歌喉，所以遊客想聽一曲茶歌而不得。</p>
<p>九溪茶塲的龍井茶配上溪水，吃來如同浴脚於溪澗冷水一般滋味，這裏的蘆蓬下茶座與舛女茶客，叫人忘了身在亂世不定中，我與我的遊　沫弟出九溪茶塲即在石塊公路上步至錢塘江邊，雇了一隻小船順流向杭州市，在船上看錢地江水奔向東海，流靜面寬闊，無聲似有聲，只覺一會兒之江大學紅瓦洋房與綠樹過去了，一會兒六和塔的高影過去了，一會兒秘們流過錢江鐵路大橋，我們於杭市郊外登岸再雇車經公路湖濱入市、看南湖水面已是荷葉初浮水，盛夏的夜晚，睡運不久即將飄香湖上，就　這湖，蓮，艇，西湖的夏夜就够引人了，我們刦後的生涯，眞想做一個職業舟子爲有情人操獎，把一身征塵在晚風裏吹盡。</p>
<p>可是據船去說，目下一隻白木船要二十萬才打造得成，若果一應齊備，如各種設備如沙發坐墊，布蓬等，需四十五萬元，我們到底是在現社會安排中的一顆螺絲釘，這湖上生涯是命定輪不到了，我們恐怕盛夏無機會來遊西湖，先狂吸幾口夜晚湖上鮮氣吧。</p>
<p>在最後一次遊湖中，船夫又說西湖所以永遠好，永遠淸鮮，就因爲她的永是南西北三面高山流下的不絕泉水，由東而平地暗閘流入錢塘江去，白天裏遊艇弄亂了水質，到夜晚，淸新泉水東流至湖，濁汚了的湖水暗流入江，淸晨湖上水裏又淸鮮如新，所以湖濱居民都在一早用木桶汲水存蓄，作一日飲用。杭州人是幸福的。水質好，湖山美麓，令人萬分傾慕。</p>
<p>杭州十五日通訊澍林寄</p>
<h3>理想新企業試驗示範區　雲南蠺業新村</h3>
<p>— 昆明十七日通訊　波瀅</p>
<p>四月十六日，記者搭滇越鐵路特快車，由昆明至開遠，車於早晨七時開，下午六時到，整日悶居車廂中，備極疲累。幸有同行同學楊君，相與談笑，以消永畫。楊君專攻蠶桑，這番係赴草壩蠶業新村實習。記者則係觀光性質，着重於調査新村的組織和一般的概况，兩人目的雖殊，興趣則同。次日因雨滯留開遠。十八日復由開遠搭火車南下，在碧色寨前一站下車，即到草壩。（滇俗稱四山環繞中之高原日壩）。</p>
<p>草壩位於雲南蒙自縣境，貼近開遠縣，是四面環山的一塊平地，總面積約有八萬五千畝。雲南蠶業新村即設於斯。草壩於雲南省政府未設開蒙墾殖局以前，水利失修，土地荒蕪，人口稀少，極目蕭凉。待開蒙墾殖局成立，開始先將全壩地權，逐漸備價收回。二年之間，濬通溝渠，劃分田疇，氣象爲之一新。</p>
<p>設立蠶業新村發生示範作用</p>
<p>雲南蠶業新村成立於民國二十八年，佔地的一萬畝，係向墾殖局長期租賃來的。蠶業新村的設立，係一種理想新事業的實騐，目的在建設示範的新農村，以爲改造我國農村，改進我國農業的準備。創辦者實驗性的科學精神和示範性質，對於我國今後農業的前途，自仍有其功績和價値。</p>
<p>民國二十八年四月，在昆明開過了雲南蠶業新村股份有限公司成立會以後，便孕育了這個雲南蠶業新村。原來公司的名稱，蠶業兩字，表示範圍，新村兩字，表示制度。公司雖按照有限公司組織法成立，但是構成這公司的股東，並非個人，而是中央與地方政府所屬下之銀行，當初的資本總額爲國幣一千萬元，至三十年增爲二千五百萬元，以迄於今。由實業鉅子繆雲台氏任公司董事長，我國農業專家葛敬中氏任總經理。</p>
<p>新村佔地萬畝綠桑一望無際</p>
<p>關於公司的組織，在總經理之下，有總技師負技術方面責任，並分設下列各處：總務處，總攬一切事務。財務處，總管公司收支。桑務處，負責栽桑。蠶務處，負責育蠶。絲務處，負責　絲。教育處係與墾殖局合辦，負責敎育農民子弟。另設有絲廠及酒精廠各一所，酒精廠除提煉酒精外，兼以桑子製造菜濟，近年來暢銷昆明爲盟軍所樂飲之桑子酒（Mulberry　Wine），多由此間供給。另外，在昆明還設有駐昆辦事處及冷庫一所。</p>
<p>新村占地約一萬畝，其中桑園占七千餘畝。因爲富初計劃很宏大，準備逐步擴展，把整個草壩都包括在新村範圍以內，所以有許多設備都是整個性的。新村築有十字形的二大幹道，各寬七公尺。自東至西，銜接草壩車站，而達西山麓，自南至北由南山麓而達北山麓。當筆者在草壩軍站下車，漫步於東西幹道上，但見兩旁錄桑成林，越阡連陌，展望前路，以碎石舖成的幹這，筆直向西，一望無際，胸襟爲之一暢</p>
<p>東西幹道東段劃成新村範圍</p>
<p>傍滇越鐵道草壩車站南端，劃爲工業區，絲廠及酒精廠均設於此。在東西幹道靠草壩早姑一端，則爲十六村。按公司原來計劃係分設許多小村，每村五十聯，每聯兩單位村屋，每單位村屋計工作室深七·二五公尺，寬四·五〇公尺者兩間，住室深四·二五公尺，寬三·三五公尺者兩間，廚房，厠所各一。每聯前後距離十五公尺，左右各距六公尺。但十六，十三兩村，剛經建立，越南即淪敵手，於是滇越鐵路中斷，材料來源缺乏，建築工程陷於停頓。後來墾殖局利用熟手匠工（起先新村所有水，木，竹，石諸項工匠皆係下江雇來，人數達千餘人）就地取材，又築成許多小村，如現在分佈草壩之第一村，第二村，第五村，第六村，十七村，十九村，二十村等，由墾殖局供給耕種本局土地之佃農居住。由十六村沿幹這而西，步行的二十分鐘，即爲十三村，兩村之間，並設有招待所及醫院。再西至十字形的幹道交叉口，此處爲新村的理想中心，原定在此設立總村，爲全村之總樞紐，但未成事實。嚴格說來，現在的新村範圍僅限於東西幹道東段。</p>
<p>主業分成三項栽桑育蠶繅絲</p>
<p>蠶業新村，顧名思義，是以蠶業爲主業的，蠶業裏面包括：栽桑，育蠶，繅絲三項。栽桑與繅絲兩項，歸蠶業公司經辦。因爲大規模的栽桑，統籌辦理，比較容易得到平勻而良好的桑葉。至於繅絲，因爲要製成勻凈的高級生絲，需要良好的機械設備，又須尋求良好的市塲，所以公司在營業時期之內，自不能不有這樣的權利和義務。因此只有第二項育蠶，才是村戶的眞正主業，村戶係招致附近農民及外界人士的參加，由公司予以相當的技術訓練，這裏稱爲村友。村友由公司供給住屋，蠶種蠶室，蠶具等，並且爲了顧全一般農民的經濟情形，還設有預支繭款的辦法，以資救濟。因爲我們知道通常的蠶繭成本，包括：蠶種，桑葉，蠶室，蠶具，人工及伙食，消耗諸項，除了前四項由公司供給外，人工及伙食，消耗等，還是需要現款的支出。所謂「預支繭款」辦法，就是按照你起初育蠶時的蠶蟻兩數，預計你將來可收的繭子擔數，然後折合市價數目，除去蠶種，桑葉等費用，公司可以讓你預先分期支用，而不必待至交繭之時。</p>
<p>合盛時期消逝新村景象荒涼</p>
<p>通常養育蠶蟻一兩，可生產繭子兩擔。當新村全盛時代，每期可產繭子約九百擔，一年春秋兩期，可收一千八百擔。當時草壩頗爲繁盛。但後來通貨膨脹，日呈惡化，生產事業，趨向衰落，而政府復推行統購統銷政策，蠶絲亦列人統購統銷之中，於是成本逐日高漲，而價格無法提高，蠶絲生產，陷於絕境，新村盛况亦不復見。去年八月以後，全國經濟不景氣，竟隨抗戰勝利以俱來，不得已，於九月底再度緊縮，這次雖名曰緊縮，實係結束，各部門除留極少數善後人員外，全部遣散。所以記者這番抵達草壩，景况頗爲荒凉。去年公司結束後，房屋爲軍險所佔用，且均遭破壞。絲廠及酒精廠亦闃無人聲，荒寂得可怕。現在只有十三村，還在育蠶，此係今春開始恢復者，蓋葛敬中氏去滬後鑒於江浙一帶蠶業在抗戰時期破壞殆盡。今年江浙能製蠶種，最多不過四十萬張，而全國需要達一百二十萬張。除可由日本輸入一部外，尙屬不敷。乃主張恢復蠶業新村，但爲保證不蝕本起見，工作範圍限於製種。現在這一期（春季）預料可製種十八萬張，秋季亦可的略等於此數，則今年草壩可產蠶種約三十五萬張之譜。</p>
<p>雲南氣候高燥宜於蠶業製種</p>
<p>我們展望我國蠶業前途，是頗抱樂觀的，因爲下列三個原因造成我們樂觀的因素：（一）國外市塲的恢復，特別是美國的大量需要。根據中央社五月十二日紐約電：美國需要我特產，蠶絲亦在其列。（二）因淪陷區的收復，用絲區域隨之擴展。（三）政府統購統銷政策的廢止。自然，困難並不是沒有，諸如：（一）淪陷區蠶業的慘遭破壞，我國蠶業範圍最大之太湖區，破壞在百分之七十以上，他如廣東區。山東區。東北區等，亦均破壞甚巨。欲圖恢復，恐非三五年不爲功。（二）日本的競爭，日本蠶業的根基原較我國爲佳，恢復自較簡易。且日木自戰敗以後，重工業在盟國管制之下，無法復興，唯就蠶絲等輕工業方面謀求發展。（三）美國工業產品，尼隆（Nylon）的應用普遍化。不過這些困難是可以用人力克服的，常然這有待於蠶業人士的努力及政府良好蠶業政策的制定。至於雲南蠶業，雖然與江浙廣東相較，自屬遜色，但雲南氣候高燥，特宜於製種，如能在這一方面努力，自亦有其可喜的前途。末了，記者要向現在草壩負責製稱之蠶業專家胡鴻鈞敎授致謝，因爲他詳盡的指示，使記者能順利地作成這篇通訊。</p>

<h3>漫談喜劇的形態</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>近來有人在喊：我們需要發抒深沈的悲哀，更需要在爽朗的歡笑中獲得生活的力。在悲劇的另一面，更需要喜劇。喜劇是通過藝術的手法而供給人們「笑」的資料。不過　憂所說的「笑」，應該是充滿着藝術的后氣氛的，是蘊藏於人們靈魂深處，足以喚發人類最高和生活理想，給予人類最高精神安慰的一種笑，不是由低級趣味所引起的笑和庸俗觀念所引起的笑。</p>
<p>喜劇正和悲劇一樣，有牠社會的意義，當然牠也是剖析社會的真相給人看，寫善良的人，也寫醜惡的人，歌頌人生理想的偉大，也暴露社會的陰暗，有溫暖，也有冷酷。在陽光的後面揭露黑暗，在莊嚴的後面是荒淫。實際上，照高爾斯華綏的看法，悲劇和喜劇並沒有絕對截然的分別，更不能從字面上去分辨。誠然，悲劇滲透了悲哀的成分，把人間的辛酸悲愁給和　托出，使觀眾也感受到一種深沈的悲哀，而喜劇則是對於個人或社會中的某些缺點，以嬉笑怒罵的態度，來使觀眾感受到一種內在的笑。但是你不能說在喜劇裏面就埃塞俄比亞沒有悲哀。而且有些偉大的喜劇，像果戈里的「巡按」，從嚴厲刻骨的議刺中，會使人感到一種欲哭不能欲笑不能的隱衷。</p>
<p>從到西洋文字史上，我們可以追尋喜劇的特徵。在喜劇整個發義展的過程中，有各種不同的形態。大約羅馬的那種以巧計或情勞為主的喜劇屬於一類，伊利莎白時代的那種以見有浪漫主義色彩與精神的喜劇又是一類。與充滿着幻想的浪漫的喜劇，同時代的還有另一種　刺的現實的喜劇。法國的莫利哀的性格喜劇也產生於同時。此外，英國復辟時代的幽　的喜劇又是一種形態，十八世紀到十九世紀初的感傷的喜劇應該屬於另一類。</p>
<p>到蝗害代，喜劇似乎並未產生新的物質，也可以說，近代的喜劇並未創造出超越於過去的形態。古代喜劇的特質和效果，分別存生於近代的喜劇中。誠如戲劇理論家章泯說：「好些喜劇在本質上具有舊形態，不過因為近代的舞台和社會的特別條件，而略有變化。有的喜劇是混雜着兩個以上的舊形態的。」所以要明瞭近代喜劇的特性，不得不認清古代各種不同的喜劇的形態。</p>
<p>格　果雷夫人的「海辛司·哈爾維」和　克瓦德的「手中島」二劇，在可笑的對話之中，襯托出典型的性格，並不像「趣劇」那樣旦有誇大的特性，這是羅馬時代那種以情勢或巧計為主的喜劇的代表。在約翰·辛格的「西方健兒」和蕭伯納的「醫生的狼狽」二劇中，就揭露當時社會上的人們的愚行，並加以諷刺一點來說，很像伊利莎白時代蔣森之流的喜劇家所寫的諷刺現實的作品·伊利莎白時代浪漫喜劇的特性在巴克和赫斯曼的作品中有時也可以發現。至於莎士比亞的那種浪漫喜劇的精神，則充分表現於近代的音樂喜劇中。</p>
<p>法國莫里哀的喜劇自成一派，他是以人們的各種對立觀念的衝突為基礎，用詼諧而帶嚴肅的態度表現人與人之間，人與社會之間的關係。這稱為性格的喜劇，是喜劇最完美最高的一種形態，要寫成這類成功的作品比其他特性的喜劇要難得多，因為不易處理人物，尤其是人物的性格。歐文的「富拉稄續弦夫人」柏曼的「第二人」和蕭伯納的「坎第·達」一　而知是屬於性格的喜劇。</p>
<p>此外說到以機智和幽默的氣氛為基調，而從對話中流露出趣味的那種喜劇，在近代似乎很少見，雖然牠在近代的各種喜劇的特性中佔有很重要的地位。王爾德的「少奶奶的扇子」和莫痕的「圓圈」可說是幽默的喜劇的成功作品。</p>
<p>最少引人注意的要算是十八世紀和十九世紀初的那種感傷的喜劇。大約由於這類喜劇的形態是否有牠的藝術價值，還是一個疑問。照近代喜劇家的研究，認為感傷的喜劇不能算是成功，因為他竭力欲排除的一種　　的氣氛，已公認為是喜劇的主要特性，同時近代喜劇多滲透了幻想的成份，而感傷的喜劇並不重幻想，甚至排除幻想。在近代比較接近感傷的喜劇的要推巴蕾，分析他的作品，確係感傷成份居，多過去的喜劇的形態，給近代的喜劇家的影響很大，有的作家把握着一種過去的喜劇形態，有的作家兼　兩種過去的喜劇形態，克萊的「炬手」雜有羅馬喜劇和英國稪辟時代的喜劇兩種特性。有人說近代的喜劇是模仿過去的舊形式，未能創造出新的東西來。這說法是不對的，原來喜劇的發展在無形中也有一定的必然的趨向，牠經過歷史的演進，至近代的達到牠發展的頂點了。我們自然不能希望再有新形態創造出來，因為喜劇的基本特性限制了牠。過去的喜劇的形態存在於現代的喜劇中，只可說是必然的結果，不能說是純粹的模仿。</p>
<p>總之，近代的喜劇是把握着過去的喜劇家所提供出來的各種喜劇特性，通過近代的社會和舞台的條件而形成的。近代的喜劇也可說是喜劇的整個發展中的最高的最完美的階段，而近代的喜劇家採取了過去的喜劇的理論與實踐，以擴充近代喜劇的藝術價值，發揚近代喜劇的藝術功能，使之形成一種最完美的喜劇形態。</p>
<h3>生活和藝術</h3>
<p>— 宋壽昌</p>
<p>生活兩個字一般人常常把它誤解，以為生活即是生存；可是照兩者底含義說起來，生存不過是生活的條件之一，却不是生活的全部。所謂生活，可分做兩方面：（一）生存——是物質的生活；（二）生趣——是精神的生活。</p>
<p>譬如：一個生物要想圖生命底存在，竭力地為飢，寒，住而掙扎着，這呌做生存，生活除掉圖生存之外，更需要豐富的趣味。換句話說：生活是愉快的，是向上的。生活中的趣味——生趣，是社會進化底原動力，設使生活沒有興趣，那末無論什麼事，都沒有進化的希望；這樣的生活，變幫了疆死的生活。由具有這種生活底人類來組織社會，社會也一定是疆死的，永沒有進化的一天。所以我說生活不單單為着生存而生活，生活要有意義，要有趣味；現社會進化途程上的大組礙，自然容易解決了。</p>
<p>以人的生活和禽獸的生活而論：禽獸的生活簡單，祇可以說是生存；人類不僅僅乎需要生存，還有禽獸生活沒有的生活，即所謂精神的生活。人與禽獸的差異，便在乎這一點上。所以「人」稱做「有理性的動物」。人類底生活中有一種精神活動，即思想，感情，意志是。這種精神活動能夠發生多方面的效果，由思想的活動，發現科學上及哲學上的一切真理，它是知識和哲理產出的源泉。出感情的活動，啓發大自然所蘊藏着的美，創造出多樣形式不同趣味的藝術品，使人類底生活感受了美的陶冶，美的享樂。生活的趣味，即建築在這個感情活動的基礎上。由意志的活動，表現行為和道德。這三者惟理性動物所獨有。禽獸雖則具有一個腦袋，却不曾運用思想。禽獸也許有感情作用，而缺乏高尙而優美的情操，善通就所謂美感，所以沒有科學上知識的發見也沒有一種趣味的生活和美的生活。</p>
<p>為應付環境起見，人類與禽獸原來都有一種圖生存的能力。如人類的生活方面需要衣啦，住啦，食啦，禽獸也曉得去找尋食物以免飢餓，住到山穴裏去避風雨和防它物的侵害，身上生了長長的毛以禦寒暑。凶猛的瓜牙，巨大的筋力，它的　侮外敵的力量，比人類利害到幾倍，何以禽獸不但不能爭勝人類，而外被人類所馴服？人類天天向進化的軌道上前進，而禽獸祗是擾慢地走到那退化的境界裏去，這個原因，便是由於它底生活，祗是生存的生活緣故。</p>
<p>我們既號華為有理性的動物，那末都應該生活在人類的生活中，凡是禽獸沒有的生活，人類獨有；禽獸做不到的生活，人類做到，而這種禽獸所沒有的生活，做不到的生活，要全靠着我們精神活動中美的感情來創造的。因為感情是創造一切的引擎，惟感情的生活，才是有趣味的生活。我們別要一味在物質的生活上去打量計算，同時還需要精神生活的調劑，使生活有豐富的趣味，求得精神上的快慰。譬如剛　前面所述過的，禽獸何嘗沒有服飾，飲餐，居室？然而終不及人類服飾的講究——冬暖夏涼，頗能適合我們底體溫，飲餐的鮮美而有味，居室的宏敝而精美，這種生活，它們那裏有享受的資格。</p>
<p>再如陶冶性情，愉快生活音樂，繪畫，等等用音底結合表現出美麗的典調，用彩色的拼合，成功美麗的天然風景，這種欣耳悅目的東西，禽獸能作麼？即使能夠，在精神上究竟同人類兩樣的。總之這種美底表演，是人底生活所獨有的。人類要求正當的生活，享受愉快的生活，第一要義成有趣味的人生。做人沒有生活底趣味，使不是人底生活，無異於禽獸的生活！</p>
<p>正當趣味底人生，要怎樣養成呢？那必須有賴於藝術的功用，用藝術品的欣賞，來訓練美的感情，像音樂，跳舞，戲劇，電影，繪畫……等等，多是很有趣味的藝術它不但能夠陶冶吾人底性情，且可以調劑吾人底生活，於不知不覺中被藝術所融合，把齷齪的思想，墮落的意志漸漸地消滅，而走向有趣味的生活之路！</p>
<h3>凄涼的夢</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>昨夜，在月暗風冷的死寂中，我忽然做了一個夢。</p>
<p>我夢見自己穿着一件黑色的衣服，披着一塊黑色的長紗，揑着一朶黑色的小花，我似乎迷失在一片荒涼的山野裏，垂着頭，在低低的哀哭。</p>
<p>我忘記哭　掉了多少時候，驀地，我聽到一個奇怪的聲音。</p>
<p>我感到驚喜起來，因為那聲音似乎非常熟悉，我驚喜起來，因為那聲音似乎就在我的上面。於是我仰起頭來向上面尋找，突然，我的血肉一齊沸騰了！</p>
<p>原來是他！他竟坐在高高的雲端，在輕輕呼着我的名字！</p>
<p>一剎時我把什麼都忘記了，只是睜大眼睛凝注着他！我看見他在向我流淚，他在向我招手。我又看見雲端有一根細細的繩子，在垂下來，可是並不垂到我的　邊，却掛在我的手夠不到的遠處。於是我急了，大喊一聲：「為了你，我就是粉身碎骨，我也願意的呀！」就蹤上身去抓住了那根繩子。然而正當那時候，霹　一響，我醒來了！</p>
<p>我醒來了！我摸摸自己的眼睛是濕的。我的心在砰砰的跳。我沒有爬上雲端，我也沒有粉身碎骨。我孤零零地吊縣在空之中，我的夢就完了！</p>
<p>啊！我惆賬！為什麼在月暗風冷的死寂中，我還要做這麼一個凄涼的夢</p>
<h3>薄暮</h3>
<p>— 蘇丹</p>
<p>燕子尚未來時，這三月的薄暮，黃錯的風呵！輕輕的。</p>
<p>輕輕的冷啦，已是三月的末尾了，為什麼春寒依舊這樣料哨，我呵！需要一些溫暖的火滔，像那桃花開的，什麼的顏色，你能告訴我嗎？桃花什麼時候會時候？</p>
<p>當燕子飛來的時候，桃花就會開啦！</p>
<p>是嗎？那我要趁這時候，趕到江南去，等着燕子飛不，守候到江南去，等着燕子飛來，守候那綻開的桃花，溫暖的火熖。</p>
<p>唔。那裏會有一個蒼翠的春天，且莫說旅路之遼長，但是，你不怕有那難苦的行程嗎？真的，你不怕？</p>
<p>啊！是輕鬆的搖頭，這是一種力，還是一個祈望。</p>
<p>我不想多說話了，應該珍惜自己的語言，我有如許的沉思與默想，讓我學習一個朋友一樣，學習他深深的沉默吧！他說這是金。</p>
<p>我是在憶着，夢着，漠漠的懷想着春天，是過去的，也是未來的，那末遼遠的天涯的夢，我也愛春天。</p>
<p>似遠遠的江南草場上，窈窕的牧女的鈴聲，輕盈的。</p>
<p>輕盈的響着，你說：告訴你，明朝，也許就是明朝，在黎明昇起之前就得啓程啦　！</p>
<p>去吧！去趕上黎明，去追着春天，摛住那溫暖與歡笑。</p>
<p>夕陽歸去也，晚霞正濃，想給你一朶雲霞，或是給你一怎黃昏的風。</p>
<p>燕子尚未來時，這三月的薄暮，黃昏的風呵！輕輕的。</p>
<h3>十字街</h3>
<p>— 楊企光</p>
<p>你曾在十字街頭眺望過嗎？你曾在人的潮，人的海中，找出了東西南北的方向嗎？你看，有多少人徘徊在這中間啊！疲乏無力的眼神，尋覓着路，可是往那兒走呢？</p>
<p>現在，十字街頭沒有霧，一絲霧都沒有，就有那是烟囪冒出來的塵埃，是被汽車翻滾飛騰的泥土，是人們的太息，……但是你儘可撥開絆腳石，去尋求你的路呀！</p>
<p>那是十分清晰的，當你的眼睛沒有被酒酗得紅爛，沒有為都市繁華所陶醉，你會張開你的　利如鷹隼的眼睛，在人羣中去尋覓一條路。</p>
<p>這裏往東邊走，是華貴的街，有士　土的大廈，有紅色的宮墻在等待你；往西邊走有累困的，流着熱汗的勞動者羣；往南邊走，有海風，有堤岸的明月，有詩篇，有黃金的夢；北方，那是有刮人的風沙，凜冽的寒風，廣闊的原野，那兒的人有寬大的心，和顔悅色……。</p>
<p>你怎樣選擇你的路呢？</p>
<p>十字街是流水的漩渦，被捲到水底，又被沖到水面……。</p>
<p>我呢？是有一定路向的人，每天我走一定方向的路，我曉得什麼地方是我的家，什麼地方，有我的伴侶；什麼地方，有我的　友；什麼地方會通達到我的希望和企求彼岸呀！</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛　（三八）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>真的，翁二太太這一年來，憔悴得變了形，這也是讓她悲哀的一點！為了心緒不佳，為了操勞，當然比往常顯的蒼老，而且又沒有了往常那一身的　裝麗服。因此更加上一層狼狽。</p>
<p>兩個小女孩瞪着眼睛瞅翁二太太，像瞅一個陌生的人。</p>
<p>小雲！怎麼不呌媽呀？不認得媽了麼？翁二太太拉過小雲顫聲地說。</p>
<p>小雲沒言語，在小雲的記憶裏，翁二太太這麼溫柔慈愛地呌她，撫她，還是第一次。她的小心坎裏在忖度着，她小能相信這就是那個曾經遺棄她的母親！她楞了半響，才扭妮不自然地呌了聲『媽』，可是一點熱烈的表示也沒有。</p>
<p>翁二太太又拉過麗華來，親切地親了親麗華的額說：</p>
<p>『這孩子變得越發俊了！　在念書沒有？』</p>
<p>麗華微笑地搖搖頭。</p>
<p>「怎麼不言語呀，快呌乾爸爸！」墨太太推着麗華說。</p>
<p>「乾爸爸！」麗華也極不自然地呌了一聲。她不再微笑了，她這時心裏　　過，因為「爸爸」這名詞她已經很久沒有呌過了，如今，撩起了她的思念，她對墨老爺的思念！她又想墨老爺了！想那埋葬　墨老爺的荊州，想留有無限墨老爺足跡的家！</p>
<p>由於「乾爸爸」三個字，翁二太太立刻記起那個永遠不呌她乾爸爸的寶玲，於是問墨太太：</p>
<p>「寶鈴呢？你怎麼沒帶他來呢？」</p>
<p>「唉！」墨太太未說話先嘆氣。「妹妹別提他了！這孩子越發變壞了，簡直和他老子年輕時候的脾氣一一模一樣，他要往東，你絕不能讓他往西。這是命！我算白生了這個兒子！」墨太太說到最後，眼圈兒有些紅。</p>
<p>「可是，墨大哥後來就變隨和了，寶鈴將來也會變隨和的，年青人總是愛任性。」翁二太太安慰墨太太。她說這話有着雙關的意思，因為她的石王樓也是個「任性」的。</p>
<p>寒暄了一陣子，翁二太太才把墨太太母女們招待到屋裏坐。墨太太稍稍掃視了一下這個家的環境，直覺地使她立刻關心到翁二太太的生活。</p>
<p>「石老板還好吧？這程子境況怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「一言難盡！一言難盡！」翁二太太恰恰當地用着習慣的京戲台词回答墨太太。在這句話裏，包含着萬千的衷曲！</p>
<p>翁二太太拿了些糖果，把麗華麗雲兩個小姊妹，安排到外間屋裏去。自己便和墨太太兩個老姊妹，習在裏間屋裏談心。</p>
<p>這一年多以來的委屈，一年多以來的　煎，　一道決了口的河渠，翁二太太毫無掩飾地滔滔不絕向墨太太傾訴着。自然，在辛酸裏面，也有過甜蜜；在悲哀裏面也有過快樂；但究竟甜蜜和快樂，沒有辛酸和悲哀多，特別是近來。從前翁二太太的一些幸福的憧憬如今幾乎完全破滅了！她不再企圖什麼，她只希望能這樣寗地伴着石玉樓一輩子就夠了。她遺棄翁老爺，那是因為她恨翁老爺，她可經不起石玉樓遺棄她，因為她愛石玉樓。她固然理解石玉樓近來的脾氣壞，是由於境況不佳，但她又怕石玉樓是變了心！因此，她常常為了自己的日形蒼老感到憂懼。</p>
<p>「想不到，想不到如今我依然受着那麼多的折磨！但是我忍了！因為我覺得有他在我身邊，我就滿足。能這樣下去倒也罷了，只要不再出別的岔兒。」翁二太太說着眼眶又有些濕。</p>
<p>「你的話不錯，這是命！咱們只好聽天由命。我睢石老板不是個狡猾人，你這樣奉承他，他不會辜負你的。」墨太太同情地勸慰着墨太太。語氣裏，有着不　感慨的心情。」</p>
<h3>口笛</h3>
<p>— 陳淦</p>
<p>皎潔的明月漸漸上升了。村裏的小娃兒，齊集在大樹下，合唱簡單調的，漫散的俚歌後，又在傾　聽着那悠悠的口笛聲了。蕭條約悽涼的聲浪，飄浮在漫無邊際的太空中，益便得烔着鬼眼的星兒　了。</p>

        <h1>1946 - n144</h1>
<h3>Blocking the Breach Near Kaifeng: The UNRRA Plans to Restore the Yellow River's Course; Dyke Restoration Project Limited to Completion by the End of June</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] UNRRA Director La Guardia announced last night that UNRRA engineers are currently leading a dramatic effort to complete the closure of a one-mile breach in the Yellow River dike by July 1st, enabling the restoration of production on two million acres of fertile Chinese land. The UNRRA engineering teams are concentrating 100,000 workers, paid by the Chinese government and supplied with food by UNRRA, to return this major river to its original course. The dike was breached in 1938 during wartime to impede the advance of Japanese forces. With the flood season approaching, the urgent task is a race against time to close the main breach before July 1st. After July 1st, the river will overflow, and the project cannot proceed until after the flood season. This is UNRRA's largest-scale post-disaster relief plan. The project's chief consultant engineer, Dodd, stated in his telegram to La Guardia: "From an engineering standpoint, excluding other factors, this project can be completed in time. If we are fortunate, the flood season may not arrive until mid- to late July, but we cannot rely on this. We should aim to complete the project by July 1st." In accordance with the planned schedule and in cooperation with the Chinese Executive Yuan Relief Administration and other Chinese government agencies, UNRRA initiated the dike restoration project at the beginning of this year. The number of workers engaged in the massive breach closure project is steadily increasing, currently reaching 10,000. These workers are building earthen dikes, while another group is quarrying stone in the mountains not far from Zhengzhou. By July 1st, 160,000 people will be working on the 400-mile dike from Kaifeng to the sea, with 150,000 working near the main breach near Kaifeng, and another 2,000 working in the stone quarries. The final closure will be a rock-filled dike, reinforced with wooden piles. Each wooden pile will be driven 60 feet into the riverbed. Two giant pile drivers have been shipped by UNRRA from the United States. Then, a massive dike, approximately 50-60 feet wide and a mile long, will be built along the main breach. The dike will be reinforced with thousands of tons of rock and barbed wire to resist water impact. According to La Guardia, the difficulty of transportation and supply is no less than the actual engineering work. Thousands of tons of materials must be transported by narrow-gauge railway to the construction sites between Zhengzha and Kaifeng. The main materials must come from Shanghai, over 500 miles away. Currently, transportation is underway day and night to accelerate the delivery of supplies to the area. The breach closure and dike restoration project also includes the problem of large populations. Approximately 250,000 residents from 500 villages within the old course of the Yellow River have already been relocated, all within areas controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. These people must be moved before the breach is closed and the Yellow River flows into its old course. The Yellow River dike repair project by the Chinese government's Water Conservancy Commission will last for ten years. UNRRA is providing emergency technical and material assistance to rebuild and repair the 400-mile-long river dike from Zhengzhou to the sea to prevent continued flooding.</p>
<h3>Kizer Submits Report to UNRRA: Our Country's Famine Situation is Severe; 33 Million People Cannot Get Enough to Eat</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] Kizer, the former Director-General of UNRRA's Shanghai branch, also submitted a report, announcing that China's food situation is deteriorating rapidly. According to UNRRA's latest survey, 33 million people are not getting enough to eat, of whom 7 million are on the verge of starvation. The last report UNRRA received from China stated that 30 million people were not getting enough to eat. Currently, the worst famine areas may be Henan Province. In addition, food is also insufficient in densely populated areas such as Hunan, Guangxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, and southern Guangdong. The crops in these provinces cannot be harvested for another 60 days, and even then, the harvest will be far below normal. Hunan is at the core of the famine zone and was the battlefield of the last major war against the Japanese army. Farmers, both men and women, are now personally dragging plows, as oxen were slaughtered almost entirely during the war. UNRRA has established six major porridge kitchens in the province, providing relief to 17,000 starving people daily, and has also established numerous small-scale porridge kitchens in remote areas, providing for several thousand starving people. These people are too weak to trek to larger cities to receive porridge. There is a porridge station in Hengyang. Famine has forced many people to steal. Infants abandoned by impoverished parents are piled up like mountains. Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Shanxi, Chahar, and Shandong provinces also have varying degrees of famine. If UNRRA's engineers win the race against time, the land freed up by the Yellow River bed can produce 20 million bushels of wheat before this winter.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Representative Pleads for Relief</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] Today, at the Third Conference of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, our country's representative requested a fair distribution of food supplies to China. He stated that China has received less than 40,000 tons while requiring one million tons. Unless a large amount of assistance is obtained from abroad in the coming months, millions of lives cannot be saved. France proposed that the Economic and Social Council establish an International Trade Bureau to cooperate with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization to achieve a fair distribution of supplies. Czechoslovakia proposed establishing a World Food Conference, or that the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization be responsible, and utilize the secretariat and intelligence office of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization to specialize in the estimation of distribution. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department confirmed that Truman had sent a letter to Stalin, requesting Soviet cooperation to jointly solve the world famine. The White House will soon issue a statement regarding the Social and Economic Council consultations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] A senior Chinese food official told the Associated Press today that, in fact, the effective measures taken so far to relieve the Chinese famine are the result of China's own efforts. China is transferring a portion of its domestic surplus of small rice grains to the areas most severely affected by the disaster. Although the wheat shipped from Australia is "barely sufficient," the rice allocated has fallen far short of the target so far. He continued that of the 115,000 tons of rice allocated by the United Grain Bureau, almost no grain was shipped to China in the second quarter of 1946. The rice received is still what should have been delivered in the last quarter of 1945 and the first quarter of 1946. Tian Pijiu's indictment was mentioned.</p>

<h3>Garrison in Taiwan Begins Reorganization; New Organization to be Implemented Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 23rd] The garrison in Taiwan is beginning to reorganize. The new organization will be implemented on the first day of next month. The garrison, originally consisting of two divisions, will be reorganized into one division, designated as the 23rd Army of the Army, with Li Liangrong as the army commander and Ke Yuanfen as the deputy army commander.

Attention will also be paid to the surplus officers and soldiers, ensuring that no one is unemployed, and they will be allowed to return to their hometowns to farm or change careers according to their wishes.</p>
<h3>Three Charges Against Female Traitor Mo Guokang; Nanjing High Court Files Indictment; Investigation of Traitor Wen Zongyao and Others Has Begun</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 23rd] Recently, there have been widespread rumors that the execution date of traitor Chen Gongbo will be realized soon. Our reporter visited the president of the High Court, Sun, to inquire about this matter. He said that he had not received any news and that it was difficult to speculate. The reporter then asked if the execution site of traitor Chen would be moved to the Third Prison. President Sun replied with a smile: "The Second High Court does not have a fixed location for executing traitors. Moreover, a new execution ground has been opened inside the detention center. However, Chinese judicial proceedings are based on the principle of confidential interrogation, so I cannot express any opinion." Based on this speculation, it is more likely that Chen's execution site will be the new execution ground inside the detention center.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 23rd] Female traitor Mo Guokang, the concubine of traitor Chen Gongbo, served as an editor in the puppet Legislative Yuan, a member of the Legislative Committee, and a counselor and director of the confidential office of the Political Security Bureau. After the victory, fearing punishment, she fled to Japan with traitor Chen. Upon central government order, she was detained and sent back to the country and escorted to the High Procuratorate of the capital for investigation. She was indicted on the 22nd. The indictment listed her crimes, which can be roughly divided into three points: (1) Serving in important positions in the puppet government's senior positions. (2) Revising the puppet law and agreeing to pass the Basic Treaty between China and Japan, the Joint Declaration between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan, and the Declaration of War against Britain and the United States. (3) Being in charge of the highest special service agency, spying on the Central Army's military intelligence, destroying anti-Japanese organizations, searching and arresting underground workers, and persecuting patriots. She violated Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The prosecutor in charge of the case is Wang Wenjun, the former prosecutor of the Suzhou High Procuratorate. A copy was sent to the Suzhou High Court here from Beijing on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Mo Guokang, a concubine of Chen Gongbo from Panyu, Guangdong, is 37 years old this year. The High Court of the capital indicted her yesterday, and a public trial will be held at the beginning of next month. In addition, 28 traitors, including Wen Zongyao, the president of the puppet High Court, and Yang Choumei, the chairman of the puppet Water Conservancy Commission, have recently been transferred to the High Court by the military and have begun to be investigated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 22nd] The Shanxi High Court again sentenced three traitors on the 22nd. Traitor Wang Yin and Traitor Tian Yuzhi were each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for three years. Traitor Sun Honglie was sentenced to five years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for five years.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Flies to Shenyang</h3>
<p>According to last night's telegram, Chairman Chiang and his wife flew to Shenyang yesterday afternoon, and the National Army entered Changchun at 11:00 AM yesterday morning. The Communist Army illegally disturbed Changchun for more than a month, and the citizens of Changchun welcomed the National Army entering the city again yesterday morning. Our northern compatriots, who have endured the pain of being occupied for fourteen years, were able to witness the Chairman's majesty yesterday. Moreover, Changchun has just suffered from the ravages of war, so they must have mixed feelings of sorrow and joy.</p>
<p>The people hope for peace, the government seeks peace, and friendly countries are also helping us to achieve peace. In particular, Chairman Chiang's benevolence and magnanimity have always believed in stopping war for the sake of peace. In recent years, he has consistently advocated resolving the Communist Party issue peacefully through political means. Central officials have been working diligently, and representatives of the Political Consultative Conference have been traveling around, all hoping to turn hostility into friendship. Now that Changchun has been recovered, the central government's personnel in charge of receiving the Northeast can return to work. We believe that as long as the Communist Party no longer uses its troops to disturb the region, and allows the central government to take over Harbin and the administration of other provinces in the Northeast, peace negotiations can be reopened immediately after the Chairman flies to the Northeast to inspect and comfort the people. The political situation can be cleared up once and for all. Therefore, the key to domestic peace in the future still lies in whether the members of the Chinese Communist Party are truly enlightened.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we also sincerely hope that the central government will always be tolerant and continue to give them a chance to reform and serve the country, even if the Communist Party often breaks its promises. As long as the Communist Party adheres to the agreements of the Political Consultative Conference and faithfully implements the ceasefire order, the central government should not hold the past against them and should quickly reopen the door to consultation. For the sake of the people and the country, peace is ultimately better than war.</p>
<p>However, we believe that consultations should have a firm and mutually agreed principle, which is "reasonableness." Consultations should be based on "reason," and should not be about perfunctoriness and seeking temporary security. Therefore, those who call themselves mediators should adhere to this principle of fairness, and then they can seek true peace.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's arrival in Shenyang, the recovery of Changchun, and the return of the Northeast to the embrace of the motherland should bring a ray of hope for the return of peace to the country!</p>
<h3>Concentrating Efforts to Solve Major Problems</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunyi</p>
<p>Yesterday, our newspaper received many letters from readers, among which no fewer than eight or nine discussed prices—especially rice prices—and the treatment of public school teachers and military officers and soldiers. It is really impossible to publish them all. This reflects that these issues have already formed major problems that the government urgently needs to solve. It is impossible to continue to ignore them and drag them on with "due process." The repeated discussions of the salary increase for civil servants by the Supreme National Defense Council and the Executive Yuan, and the convening of a food conference by the new mayor of Shanghai immediately after taking office, all show that the central and local authorities do attach importance to these major problems. However, what achievements can be expected? Civil servants are still anxiously waiting, and rice prices are rising sharply and falling slightly. Yesterday, white rice suddenly jumped 3,000, and rice speculators are still eager to move. If the rise in prices does not stop for a day, the lives of the common people will be uneasy for a day. The treatment of public school teachers will not be able to keep up with the rising prices, and there is no way to talk about work efficiency.</p>
<p>On the day of the government's return to the capital, this newspaper had already said that the government must resolutely reform and start anew with the people. We once loudly called out: "It is better to put aside all new policies and first concentrate its efforts on stabilizing prices; it is better to save other government expenses and try to increase the salaries and benefits of military officers, soldiers and public school teachers as much as possible." We believe that if the government officials today still cannot see this, it is unwise; if they see it but have no way to solve these major problems effectively, it is incompetent; if they have indeed decided on a solution, but hesitate and procrastinate, and are unwilling to act boldly and decisively, it is a lack of courage to take on great responsibilities. It is necessary to know that today, those who are politically responsible should embrace the great courage of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" Therefore, if there is a solution, act quickly; if there is no solution, step down. The overall situation of the country has been dragged on to this day, and no one is allowed to use the "dragging" tactic to muddle through anymore!</p>
<p>Let us first examine the adjustment of the treatment of public school teachers and staff. The high prices and the poverty of public school teachers and staff, who are even struggling on the verge of starvation, is a fact that everyone knows. The public servants from the rear, coupled with the oppression of the housing shortage, even have problems with their sleeping arrangements at night, not to mention anything else. When the legislative Yuan's proposal to increase the salaries of civil servants by a thousand times was published in the newspaper, the prices went up instead of the civil servants receiving any benefits. This kind of publicity is harmful to them. Even if it is really going to be increased by a thousand times, regardless of whether the national treasury can really bear it, even if it can, then wouldn't the inflation and prices rise even more, and how much benefit can the civil servants receive? It can be seen that adjusting the treatment of public school teachers and staff is not a simple problem. However, no matter how complicated the problem is, we believe that the authorities should have a method of managing complexity with simplicity. Yesterday, the opinion of Mr. Gu Yangping in the letters from readers is worth paying attention to by the authorities.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu believes that the lives of civil servants must be saved, but where will so much money come from in today's empty treasury? Looking at the strikes and calls for salary increases, one wave has not subsided, and another wave has risen. Just as a compromise has been reached, prices have risen again, and the treatment needs to be adjusted again. In fact, the first step in adjusting the treatment is not in raising salaries but in seeking fairness. What we cannot understand at present is the unreasonableness and inequality of the treatment of civil servants. Civil servants in the same region or the same subordinate department have vastly different treatment. Just taking Shanghai as an example, civil servants in certain banks and bureaus have better treatment than other national agencies in Shanghai; the same subordinate departments, such as the China National Aviation Corporation, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Post Office, Railway and Highway Bureau, and Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, each have their own treatment, which is colorful and chaotic. Since the state has clear and unified regulations on the treatment of civil servants, why should it be so chaotic? If the treatment is determined according to the importance of the work and the size of the responsibility, it is exactly the opposite. It is said that the civil servants of the Telecommunications Bureau, which has the most difficult work and the greatest responsibility, do not necessarily receive higher treatment than others, or may even be lower. This makes you never believe what a high official with political common sense said, that agencies with more income can have better treatment, and agencies with insufficient income cannot improve treatment. According to this, civil servants from the five Yuans to the political agencies at all levels in various places cannot only not be paid, but also have to bring some money to subsidize the agencies! The country is not a business organization, so how can the amount of income be used for self-distribution? How can those who close the door to calculate their own gains do politics well? If a treatment problem cannot be achieved in equality and unity, can we expect other unity? Now all agencies can use the example of agencies with higher treatment to demand higher treatment, so that the heads of all agencies have no excuse to refuse. The cycle goes on and on, so that no civil servant is willing to work with peace of mind. Moreover, with the soaring prices and the rising demands for salary increases, how can we respond? This is the authorities' unfair treatment, and they are suffering the consequences themselves.</p>
<p>The facts mentioned in Mr. Gu's letter above should not be ignored by the high officials. We should awaken the vigilance of the great men who hold the national authority: in reality, it is not only a few powerful people who are promoting all the government affairs of the country and exerting political effectiveness, but these thousands of civil servants! If civil servants cannot live, how can they carry out politics? The fact that all the undertakings of the country are in a state of atrophy and paralysis, and that civil servants cannot have a stable life, is a major reason. Issuing banknotes indiscriminately and increasing the printing without limit is not a solution. Using high-pressure tactics and simply rejecting demands is not a solution. Dealing with things in a perfunctory manner, muddling through, and muddling through is even less of a solution. These are not only not solutions, but simply tantamount to government suicide. We do know that there are many civil servants who are wholeheartedly willing to serve the country and are willing to suffer for the country. They also understand that messing with the country is messing with themselves, and they will never make trouble without reason. The reason why there are so many problems and disputes now is because of the word "unequal"! Putting down prices, let's not discuss it for the time being today. We believe that the government officials should first concentrate their efforts at this time to handle the major problem of reasonable and equal treatment of public school teachers and staff, so that they can wash away the shame of the word "incompetence." It is also remembered that at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee in mid-March of this year, the Executive Yuan proposed the "Economic Emergency Measures Act," which did stipulate the principles of adjusting the treatment of public school teachers, military officers and soldiers, and employees of state-owned industries, so as to achieve fairness and rationality, and also pointed out the methods. However, two months have passed, how is the adjustment going? Where is the fairness? Where is the rationality? What is the use of a proposal that is decided but not implemented! "I am not afraid of scarcity, but of unevenness!" If the government officials drag on to this day and cannot even use a sharp knife to cure the root cause of the "unequal" treatment, and cannot even achieve "unity" in the reasonable and fair treatment of public school teachers and staff, we really do not know what great things the responsible officials have concentrated their efforts on!</p>
<h3>Yu Hanmou Passes Through Shanghai and Goes to Beijing, Meets with Shen Honglie in Hangzhou to Discuss Zhejiang Security Plan</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Hangzhou, 23rd Telegram] Quzhou Pacification Commissioner Yu Hanmou arrived in Hangzhou on the morning of the 23rd and immediately visited Shen Honglie, Zhu Mingtao, and others to discuss the Zhejiang security plan. This newspaper's reporter immediately went to interview him. He informed us that the people urgently need to recuperate and rebuild, so security must be maintained. All scattered bandits will be strictly suppressed. All troops under the jurisdiction of the Pacification Commission will be reorganized in accordance with central government laws and regulations. Surplus officers and soldiers have also been properly resettled, and the entire process is expected to be completed by the end of this month. In terms of transportation, special commissioners have been dispatched to inspect various important locations and consult with local governments to repair them immediately. After the demobilization of the Youth Army, other troops will take over the defense. There are very few Japanese war criminals remaining in Zhejiang, so it is not planned to set up a separate military tribunal; they will be directly transferred to Shanghai for trial. The issue of military rations will be handled by the Pacification Commission itself. Mr. Yu attended a banquet hosted by Chairman Shen at noon, and at 3 PM, he took a special train to Shanghai. After staying for one day, he will go to Beijing to report to Chairman Jiang and make some requests.</p>
<p>Shen Honglie Speaks</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Hangzhou, 23rd Telegram] Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie convened a meeting of Zhejiang silk industry leaders on the 23rd to discuss preventing the suppression of cocoon prices. He also met with reporters and shared his observations from his inspection tour of eastern Zhejiang, saying: "It took ten days to inspect fifteen counties. A military conference was held in Quzhou to discuss security, transportation, and military ration issues with Pacification Commissioner Yu. Commissioner Yu provided a lot of assistance, and an agreement has been reached. Although the district administrative conference was very short, the counties had prepared quite thoroughly in advance, and the discussions were mostly frank and open. County finances are difficult, and civil servants and police cannot be adequately paid. After the people have suffered so much, they are further burdened with trivial matters such as grain levies, which makes them even more impoverished. In the counties I visited, except for Chun'an and Jianxi counties, which had relatively intact houses, the rest were scarred. In the future, we can only start with reconstruction. This year, the rainfall in eastern Zhejiang has been evenly distributed, and a good harvest is expected. The cooperation between the party, government, and public opinion organs is very good, which is very gratifying."</p>
<h3>Building Nanjing</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper Beijing Correspondent Mao Shukai</p>
<p>Because the Northeast could not be smoothly received, and the political situation in North China could not be stabilized, some people suspected that Nanjing, as the capital, was too far to the southeast, and feared that it could not take care of the vast north. They suggested moving the capital to Beiping, hoping to suppress the restless situation in North China and the Northeast. They even cited historical evidence, saying that establishing the capital in Nanjing was a temporary measure of parochial peace, while Beiping was a foundation for ten thousand years. For a time, there was turmoil in Chongqing, and the Fourth National Political Council even passed a proposal to move the capital. However, soon the facts proved that our government rejected all dissenting opinions and resolutely returned the capital to Nanjing. The debate over the issue of moving the capital also disappeared with the mountain city's tides.</p>
<p>Now that Nanjing is the location of our national capital, it is evolving from a local city into the nation's political center and an international metropolis. It is the focus of Chinese and foreign attention, so all municipal administration and construction must not be simplified. The Chairman pays the most attention to the construction of the capital. A huge sum of 600 million yuan was allocated at once to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to repair roads. After returning to the capital, the Chairman came out to inspect almost every day. In one week, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works received twenty handwritten instructions from the Chairman, specifying which road surfaces to repair, which roads were too narrow, which vacant lots to build houses on, and which houses to demolish. Even the smallest things were noticed by the Chairman. Nanjing is moving towards a goal under the Chairman's supervision and the efforts of the municipal government and all citizens. I believe it will not be difficult to successfully build a great and perfect modern city in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>After returning the capital on May 5th, the entire city of Nanjing was full of vitality, showing a new vigor everywhere. No one can remember that someone wanted to abandon her a month ago. The traces of war are gradually being diluted by this new vitality. Now, in Nanjing, wherever you go on the road, you can always smell the scent of paint and bricks and earth. Everywhere you can see carts of bricks and wood being hauled in front of you. The number of construction companies is increasing one by one, and they are still overwhelmed. Carpenters, painters, and electricians are gathering from all over, more and more every day, and they are still too busy. Nanjing is in a construction frenzy.</p>
<p>Smart businessmen are not willing to easily let go of this opportunity. They clearly see the future commercial value of Nanjing. They understand that the large number of middle and high-ranking civil servants and their families, the resident representatives of various agencies and commercial firms in Beijing, foreign envoys and dignitaries, as well as people from all walks of life who come to Beijing to handle official business, all have strong purchasing power and are their basic customers. At the same time, the beautiful Xuanwu Lake in the suburbs of Bai Xia, the quiet Jiming Temple, the clear and beautiful Yanziji, and the solemn and magnificent Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum will attract millions of tourists. The wide roads and numerous open spaces along the roads are superior conditions for commercial development. If the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is laid with double tracks, with a train arriving and departing from Shanghai every two hours, then Nanjing's commerce will develop immeasurably.</p>
<p>Even with the extreme shortage of materials after the war, the government is still proceeding with the construction of the capital according to plan, step by step. Before the war, the area south of Zhongshan North Road in Xiaguan, west of Huimin River, east of the Yangtze River, and north of Sanwu River was designated as the first industrial zone, and roads, embankments, and other infrastructure were planned. However, due to the war, it was not implemented. However, this area is surrounded by water on three sides, and the area is very limited, with a total area of only over 900 acres, which is not enough to meet future needs. Therefore, the recent municipal meeting also approved the designation of the area around Caoxie Gorge, Jinling Township, Tiger Mountain, and Elephant Mountain along the Yangtze River as the second industrial zone, in order to establish light industries such as textiles, chemicals, and food. Because it faces the Yangtze River, ships can reach it directly, and railway branch lines can also be extended into the area. The municipal government also plans to connect the main roads in the area with the main roads in the urban area, so that land and water transportation will be convenient. After this plan was announced, businesses and industries inquired with the municipal government about the procedures for leasing land in the industrial zone and the municipal government's management regulations for factories in the zone. Zhang Jianming, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, and Zai Zhonglu, Chief of the Department, who are responsible for the design and construction of the industrial zone, told me that the construction of roads, sewers, pumping stations, embankments, dams, and other projects in the industrial zone can begin as soon as the Executive Yuan approves it, and it should be completed within two years.</p>
<p>The geographical situation gives Nanjing too many superior commercial conditions. If Hankou becomes the center of heavy industry in our country, then Nanjing will undoubtedly be the central station of economic and trade between Shanghai and Hankou. If the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway is successfully laid with railways, then Nanjing will become the distribution center for goods from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. These are all predictions that can be realized in the short term. Nanjing will gradually develop from a political center to an industrial and commercial center.</p>
<p>Although the population of Nanjing has surged and consumption has increased since the return of the capital, and many new shops have appeared, the entire financial sector is still stuck in a primitive stage. If we want to develop commerce, we still need the assistance of outside manpower. We also hope that the surplus speculative capital and talent in Shanghai will quickly withdraw from the "end of the road for heroes" speculative market and jointly develop this barren land. Nanjing is eagerly expecting you.</p>

<p>Songjiang Quan Jie Tang Will Not Be Dissolved</p>
<p>The directors of the Songjiang San Shan Tang had a resolution to dissolve the Quan Jie Tang [Widow's Refuge]. The widows, due to livelihood problems, sought help from all circles in Songjiang. Elders such as Shen Lichu, Lu Guiliang, and Yang Yunquan, on their behalf, appealed to the Shan Dong [Charity Directors] requesting that the proposal to dissolve the widows' refuge be postponed. It is now supported by various Yi Dong [Benevolent Directors]. It is heard that the gentry in Songjiang generally advocate that the original funds and property of the hall should still be used to carry out the original charitable事業 [business/project] at the original address, and that the widows staying in the hall should work diligently to generate profits. The Shan Dong and Shen Lu and other elders are cooperating to plan reform matters.</p>

<p>Rice Prices Skyrocket, Organize Rice Relief</p>
<p>The rice price in Hangzhou City has been greatly impacted by Shanghai and has risen sharply in the black market, selling for more than 60,000 yuan. The people's food adjustment committee stipulates that the selling price of each rice store is only 47,500 yuan, and each person is limited to two dou [a unit of volume, about 2 gallons]. However, there are many people who carry and transport rice on a small scale, and people are panicked. The city government and all sectors of society held a meeting to discuss and decide to organize a cheap rice sale, with a price of 36,000 yuan. Each extremely poor household can buy two sheng [a unit of volume, 1/10 of a dou] per day, limited to 200 shi [a unit of volume, about 133 pounds] per day. Rice purchase certificates are printed and distributed to poor households by the district offices. Starting from the 23rd, fifteen rice stores in the urban area will be designated to sell rice, and bank groups will provide loans to rice merchants to continue purchasing rice from various production areas to adjust the people's food supply.</p>

<p>Secret Organization of Communist Army Cracked</p>
<p>The Communist Army is now establishing a secret organization in Jingjiang City, east of the county government, specializing in investigating the actions of the National Army and reporting them at any time. On the 18th, a piece of intelligence on white paper with a signature was picked up by a platoon leader of the National Army. Based on the clues, the person in charge, Chen Zhongqi, was arrested, and a list of accomplices, totaling ninety-six people, was seized. Seventeen or eight people have now been arrested. In addition, a small team of the Communist Army planned to invade the Hongqiao defense line outside the east of Yue, but was discovered by the National Army and immediately opened fire, killing one person.</p>

<p>Huinan Road, Shui-Beng Section Opens to Traffic</p>
<p>The Huainan Railway was built to transport coal produced by the Huainan Datong mines. After its construction in the 22nd year, passenger and freight transportation developed rapidly. Unfortunately, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and it fell into enemy hands. By the winter of the previous year, the entire road from Jiulonggang to Yuxikou was dismantled and rebuilt from Shuijiahu to Bengbu Railway. After the victory was achieved, the enemy wantonly destroyed the mining area, and many bridges along the road were also destroyed by the Communist Army. After the mining area was taken over by the central government, coal production only reached one-third of what it used to be. The Shuibeng Road was also closed again. It is heard from the road personnel that the monthly deficit is 2 billion yuan. Recently, the mines have been repaired and the bridges and roadbeds along the line have been rebuilt. The project has now been completed, and after a smooth test run, passenger tickets will be sold on the 20th, and traffic will begin.</p>

<h3>MacArthur's Headquarters Orders Deprivation of Japanese Imperial Family Privileges; Cessation of Stipends; Most Basic Income Completely Cut Off; Imperial Relatives Will Also Have to Find Jobs in the Future</h3>
<p>[Reconstruction Society Tokyo 23rd Telegram] MacArthur's Headquarters today ordered the deprivation of privileges and exemption from obligations for the fourteen major imperial family members of the Xian Yuan, Zhi Fu, Gao Song, San Li, Li Ben, Zhu Tian, Zhao Xiang, Fu Jian, Dong Fu Jian, Shan Jie, Jiu Yun, Dong Jiu Qian, Bei Bai Chuan, and He Yang families. All securities deposited by princes, kings, and queens with the Ministry of the Imperial Household will be returned to the depositors immediately and taxed in accordance with regulations. The Ministry of the Imperial Household is also restricted from providing princes, kings, and queens with funds or property or lending funds to them. The Ministry of the Imperial Household is prohibited from employing people to serve them. At the same time, their rights and interests to all property of the Ministry of the Imperial Household are also deprived. The assets of these imperial families are estimated to be over 50 million Japanese yen. At the time of the armistice, 8 million yen in securities were deposited in the Ministry of the Imperial Household's treasury. According to today's order, although the funds can be reclaimed and used, all other stipends received from the Ministry of the Imperial Household are prohibited. With the exception of specific imperial family members of the Japanese Emperor who are not restricted by MacArthur's order this time, the basic income of most imperial relatives and nobles has been completely cut off. In addition, the imperial family's property has always been exempt from taxation, but now this privilege has been abolished, and the imperial family's property has also become subject to taxation, which will greatly affect their future lives. In the future, they will have to go to the streets, join the common people, and find a job. Some imperial family members may be demoted to subjects.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Tokyo 23rd Telegram] Marshal MacArthur ordered today to prohibit Japanese Emperor Hirohito from subsidizing his brothers, uncles, nephews, and other imperial family members of fourteen households with 2 million Japanese yen annually. The Japanese imperial relatives and nobles will no longer burden the national treasury. However, the various imperial families will not be impoverished, because they still have more than 50 million Japanese yen in private property.</p>
<p>Hirohito Scheduled to Broadcast to the Japanese Today</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 23rd Telegram] Japanese Emperor Hirohito will broadcast to the national public three times tomorrow at noon, 7:00 PM, and 9:00 PM, perhaps because a large number of hungry people recently gathered in front of the Imperial Palace, asking him to distribute food. The Ministry of the Imperial Household is unwilling to announce in advance what Hirohito will say, but it can be predicted that the content must be very important. We have reason to believe that Emperor Hirohito will probably ask the Japanese people to tighten their belts, abandon the party struggles that have become public disputes, and cooperate to seek national revival.

<h3>Britain's Harsh Terms for Egypt; Treaty Revision Negotiations Stalled; Egypt Determined Not to Accept Incomplete Independence; British Delegation to Return Home for Instructions</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] London, 23rd Broadcast: The British delegation to Cairo for negotiations will return to England tomorrow. The delegation denied that the negotiations had failed. It is said that the return to England is to ask Bevin for instructions and report to the House of Commons.</p>
<p>[United Press Cairo 22nd Telegram] The Egyptian delegation held a meeting for three hours tonight. Representative Markley told reporters that the Anglo-Egyptian treaty revision negotiations have almost stalled. We cannot accept incomplete independence.</p>
<p>[United Press Cairo 23rd Telegram] A senior Egyptian official said today that the proposed new Anglo-Egyptian treaty proposed by Britain contains several military clauses that make it difficult for Egypt to accept. The treaty revision negotiations have been temporarily suspended because the British representatives still need to ask the government for instructions on the disputed points in the treaty. It is heard that the British representatives have asked Egypt for various guarantees, which, from a certain point of view, are actually more harmful than occupying Egypt. Britain has recently allowed the withdrawal of all troops stationed in Egypt, but the issue of the withdrawal date is still under discussion.</p>
<p>[Reuters London 23rd Telegram] The British government has made it clear that the Egyptian government should be held responsible for the assassination of two British soldiers by Egyptian mobs on March 4th. Foreign Minister Bevin replied to inquiries from Conservative MPs yesterday that the information obtained by the British military authorities has been forwarded to the Egyptian government, urging it to take action, but the Egyptian government has not yet initiated any expression of respect.</p>

<p>[United Press Hiroshima 23rd Telegram] After Hiroshima was destroyed by the atomic bomb and became a ruin, grass has now sprouted and houses are being rebuilt.

<h3>Indian Muslim League Leader</h3>
<h3>Raises Three Minimum Demands</h3>
<h3>Warns Britain to Use Force if Necessary for Resistance</h3>
<h3>British Side Clarifies the Status of Various States Before Indian Independence</h3>
<p>[Our News] London, 23rd (Radio): Although Jinnah has already issued a declaration criticizing the British proposal, the Standing Committee of the Muslim League did not issue a statement as generally expected after its meeting today, and will discuss it again tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Simla, 22nd] Jinnah, Chairman of the Indian Muslim League, recently gave a speech here expressing disappointment that the British Cabinet Mission to India refused to accept the "Pakistan Plan" advocated by the Muslim League. He stated that Pakistan is the only condition for resolving India's constitutional problem. The British Cabinet Mission to India, in order to satisfy the Congress Party, even rejected our party's demands. We must warn the British government that Indian Muslims, when necessary, will resort to armed resistance. We hereby put forward the following three minimum demands: (1) Divide the provinces of India into two independent groups, one being the six-province Muslim group and the other being the Indian group. (2) A federation consisting of the Indian and Muslim groups, with its powers limited to foreign affairs, national defense, and transportation. (3) The federal system will have a "probationary" period of ten years, during which both the Indian and Muslim groups will retain the right to secede.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] The British Cabinet Delegation yesterday sent a memorandum to the President of the Chamber of Princes of India, clarifying that before India's complete independence, the original relationship between Britain and the various states of India will be maintained, that is, Britain will still be the supreme authority of the more than 570 states of India. This relationship is stipulated by treaties previously signed by the British King and the various princes. According to these treaties, the various states have no right to foreign relations, and their internal affairs are also restricted depending on the extent to which they have ceded power to the supreme authority. People from the various states are under the protection and control of the United States when they leave the country. The laws of the British Indian government are not effective in the various states. The area of the various Indian states is 700,000 square miles, accounting for two-fifths of the Indian peninsula, with a total population of over 90 million.</p>
<p>Soviet Commentary: The British Plan's Check Has Not Been Cashed</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Moscow yesterday issued its first commentary on the British Cabinet India Plan. Commentator Yakov, in English, broadcast on Moscow Radio yesterday that although the British government declared its willingness to grant India independence, this plan does not even grant India the status of a dominion. At the same time, it is known that India's police force has been strengthened, prisons have been expanded, and British troops are still maintaining their original strength. From this, it can be seen that the Indian Provisional Government will definitely not have true sovereignty. The plan announced by Britain this time is the same plan that was rejected by the Muslim League and the Congress Party at the Simla Conference. If we only examine it on the surface, we can know the unreasonableness of the plan. Although Lord Lawrence said, "India is willing to be independent, we should grant it independence," this check has not been cashed.</p>

<h3>Iranian Government and Azerbaijan</h3>
<h3>Negotiations to Resume</h3>
<h3>Security Council Decides to Keep Iranian Issue on Agenda</h3>
<p>[Our News] London, 23rd (Radio): Iranian Azerbaijani newspapers are fiercely criticizing Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Ala, calling him an "Iranian traitor" and saying that Ala is engaging in anti-Soviet propaganda under the instigation of "imperialist reactionary masters." The newspapers demanded that the Iranian government immediately recall Ala and punish him.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 22nd] The United Nations Security Council today re-discussed the Iranian issue. After Iranian Ambassador to the United States Ala expressed doubt as to whether Soviet troops had completely withdrawn, the Council decided to refuse to withdraw the case and keep it on the agenda indefinitely, to be discussed again at any time if any national representative requests it. The Polish representative proposed sending a telegram to Sadana, asking him to reply with a simple "yes" or "no" regarding whether he was personally satisfied with the Soviet withdrawal situation. The Council also rejected this proposal by a vote of eight to two.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 22nd] According to well-informed sources: the U.S. State Department has received reports confirming that all Soviet troops have withdrawn from Iran.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] A large-scale Russian-language broadcast last night stated: A delegation of "important cabinet members of the Azerbaijani Republic," at the invitation of the Iranian Prime Minister, has departed for Tehran.

The Azerbaijani-Iranian joint investigation team has arrived at the site of the previous conflict and reported to Tehran that all hostilities have ceased.</p>
<h3>A Third World War Is Not Inevitable</h3>
<p>Stettinius Delivers Speech</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 23rd] US Representative to the United Nations Security Council Edward Stettinius today delivered a speech at the National Academy of Social Sciences, saying that the idea that a third world war is unavoidable is ridiculous. The achievements of the past two years have proven that effective cooperation between large and small countries for the cause of freedom and peace is possible and necessary, and there is no doubt about this. Effective cooperation does not necessarily require complete agreement and absence of disputes. In fact, agreement, which is essential to every human endeavor, requires both of these qualities.</p>

<p>[Our News] San Francisco, 23rd (Radio): US Army Air Forces Commander General Spaatz today declared to reserve personnel that the new B-36 bomber can carry atomic bombs for a distance of 10,000 miles. The US Air Force will maintain a force of 500,000 regular personnel. This will determine the security of the United States. After the war, US bomber speeds will be 600 miles per hour. In this atomic age, the United States cannot defend its homeland without a strong air force. Starting in July, the United States will actively train the air force at forty bases. One year later, the number of training bases can be increased to ninety.</p>

A State Department spokesperson announced today that the Soviet Union has expressed acceptance of the US proposal to revise the armistice treaty with Italy, but requested that the armistice treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary be similarly revised.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] British officials recently announced that when the four foreign ministers met in Paris, the Soviet Union suggested abolishing the control commissions established by the Allied countries in Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary.

Connally also asked, "Who gave the four powers this power?" Connally continued, "The power to conclude peace treaties lies with all the countries that fought against the enemy. I oppose the four foreign ministers drafting peace treaties and then submitting them to the peace conference, and I oppose any foreign minister being able to exercise a veto when the treaties are returned to the four foreign ministers for review."</p>

<h3>Mrs. Luce Says: Communism and Democracy Are Incompatible</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] US Communist Party Chairman Foster today declared that Communism is a "profound democratic movement." Republican congresswoman Mrs. Luce (i.e., the wife of Luce, publisher of Fortune Magazine, Time Magazine, and Life Magazine) replied, "Communism and Democracy are truly incompatible."</p>
<p>The dialogue between the two took place at a broadcast radio exchange. Foster also said that reactionaries gloat and are happy to see atomic bombs dropped around the world.</p>
<p>Mrs. Luce replied, "Why not ask Uncle Joe to drop the Iron Curtain and let us go in and see what is happening. What in Russia is he afraid freedom of the press will expose?"</p>
<p>Foster replied, "The exclusivist power of the United States is the reason for the current tensions in the United Nations."</p>
<p>Mrs. Luce asked Foster if he had ever criticized any of Stalin's actions since 1939.</p>
<p>Foster replied: Soviet policy has always been consistent.</p>
<p>Mrs. Luce said: It is completely meaningless to accuse the United States of imperialism. The Soviet Union's participation in the war was only because it had been attacked by Germany. But before that, Germany and the Soviet Union had sworn an oath of alliance. Mrs. Luce also accused Foster of being disloyal to the United States and loyal to an anti-religious system. She would rather die than live under this system.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Resolutely Vows to Punish Corrupt Merchants!</h3>
<h3>First Action Against Rice Market: One Person Arrested, Fifty Million Dollar Bail Demanded, Strict Investigation Conducted</h3>
<h3>Aims to Achieve Results in Shanghai in Six Months</h3>
<h3>"宁得罪极多数人" (Would Rather Offend the Vast Majority of People)</h3>
<p>[Our News] Mayor Wu, accompanied by his wife, attended a welcome reception hosted by the Tsinghua Alumni Association last night and delivered an important speech, providing a resolute and frank explanation on food, labor unrest, and municipal administration. The gist of the speech is as follows:</p>
<p>The situation in Shanghai has always been extremely complex. I am taking on a heavy responsibility, but I am truly lacking in talent and knowledge. Therefore, I do not want to say much about policy guidelines, because I am afraid that I will not be able to deliver on my promises in the future, only to disappoint the citizens. However, today I am happy to gather with alumni from my alma mater, and I cannot help but speak. I know that in the future, my fellow alumni will be able to provide valuable suggestions at any time and in any place.</p>
<p>The most important thing in municipal administration is to seek the soundness of the internal organization. However, there are too many pressing problems in Shanghai that need to be solved. Therefore, I had to weigh the importance and give up one in favor of the other. The most important issues in Shanghai today are rice and grain, labor unrest, and municipal efficiency. The price of rice in Shanghai has soared from over 40,000 to over 70,000 in ten days, entirely due to speculation and hoarding by corrupt merchants. Therefore, I considered this issue even before taking office. On Monday, I took office at 9:00 AM, and I notified the rice merchants at 8:30 AM, summoning an emergency meeting. Shanghai rice merchants have 500,000 dan of rice in storage, and the public has 300,000 dan in storage. This total of 800,000 dan is enough to meet the city's needs for three months. The so-called lean months are only June, July, and August. If we can get through these three months, the new rice harvest will come in, and there will be no problem with the source of rice. When I was in Nanjing, Minister Xu of the Ministry of Food told me that he had ordered 90,000 tons of rice from Brazil, and it was already on its way. Even if there is a problem with the source of rice, we only need to sell these 500,000 dan, and at least the Brazilian rice can reach Shanghai. Therefore, there is no risk of interruption of rice supply in Shanghai. I know that even though I have strictly ordered the suppression of speculation, corrupt merchants will inevitably remain active in the dark. Therefore, in addition to ordering the Social Affairs Bureau to send personnel to monitor the markets, the municipal government is also secretly dispatching officers to pay close attention. Today, we discovered someone deliberately raising market prices. Sellers were willing to sell at 51,000, but they deliberately shouted that they were willing to buy at 53,000. At 3:00 PM, this person was arrested, required to pay a 50 million dollar bail, and had their entire accounting books investigated. If this person is indeed a speculative corrupt merchant, then this person will be used to prove my determination to severely punish those who manipulate and hoard goods. They may still see me as an old bureaucrat, but I have received education from Tsinghua and have been sent abroad by the country to study. If I do not act with conscience, I will be letting down the country and Tsinghua.</p>
<p>As for the labor unrest problem, the situation is indeed very serious. The reason why Shanghai factories prospered in the past was because of the extremely low wages. But currently, wages are so high that they have even exceeded those in the United States. The welfare of workers must be considered, but we must adhere to the principle of sharing the same boat in times of adversity and find a simple and effective solution. Detailed countermeasures are still under consideration, but those who want to eat eggs cannot kill the hen that lays them first. If all the factories cannot produce, the welfare of the workers cannot be discussed.</p>
<p>In terms of other general municipal aspects, I deeply admire the high efficiency of the Shanghai Municipal Council. After our country has achieved victory, we should not only not be inferior to them, but we should also make even greater progress. However, the situation in Shanghai is so complex that it will take at least six months to achieve some results, and it is impossible to avoid offending many people. But I have received education from Tsinghua, and I will work hard even if it means "offending people, I am not afraid." Alumni are like brothers, and I hope that every alumnus will show me their opinions on municipal administration at any time. This is what I hope for.</p>
<p>Banquet Schedule: There are several invitations every day from various circles to the mayor expressing their welcome. The current schedule is as follows: This afternoon, attend the banquet hosted by lawyer Xu Shizao. At 5:30 PM on the 25th, attend the cocktail party hosted by Argentine Minister George Asis. At 10:00 AM on the 26th, attend the memorial service for General Zhan Lili, and at 7:30 PM, attend the dinner hosted by the Australian Minister. At 6:00 PM on the 27th, attend the cocktail party hosted by Admiral Kirk, Commander of the US Seventh Fleet. At 7:30 PM on the 29th, Lieutenant General Gillen, Commander of the US Army in China, will host a cocktail party for Mayor Wu at the US Officers' Club as a welcoming event.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters</h3>
<h3>Four Additional Committee Members Appointed</h3>
<h3>Mao Zipei Returns to His Original Position</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the party affairs in Shanghai and improve work efficiency, the central authorities have expanded the number of members and appointed Mao Zipei, Chen Baohua, Zhou Xuexiang, and Li Kui as party committee members. They will take office soon. Mao Zipei was originally a member of the party committee, but last year, because he served as the director of the Fourth Bureau of the Social Affairs Bureau, he had no time to take care of it, so he resigned from the party committee. Because the authorities deeply trust him, they have ordered him to return to his old position in order to achieve the effect of strengthening the party's management.</p>
<h3>Caring for the Livelihood of Residents in Impoverished Areas: Supplying Retail Tap Water</h3>
<p>For the sake of the health of people in impoverished areas, the Public Utilities Bureau has specially formulated a method for the city to provide retail tap water. In impoverished areas within the reach of the city's water plant pipelines, residents who do not have tap water facilities can appoint representatives to obtain the method and application form from the bureau, and apply for the installation of retail tap water faucets. Once verified, the installation will be carried out immediately, and legitimate merchants will be entrusted to sell the water at a fixed price, to facilitate drinking and emphasize public hygiene.</p>
<h3>"Breach of Faith" Consumer Cooperative Accuses the "Administrative Relief Committee"</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to information from the Shanghai Consumer Cooperative: The cooperative previously applied to the "Administrative Relief Committee" for the purchase of 5,000 bags of affordable flour, priced at 6,000 yuan per bag. The Finance Department of the "Administrative Relief Committee" sent a letter to the cooperative, instructing them to pay and collect the goods at the designated bank. Upon receiving this document, the cooperative believed that a "sales contract had been established" and proceeded to pay the bank and obtain the warehouse receipt according to the regulations. However, the "Administrative Relief Committee" repeatedly delayed delivery and ignored the requests. Recently, the "Administrative Relief Committee" refused to fulfill the delivery obligation, citing an order issued on March 21st to suspend sales as the reason. The cooperative believes that the "Administrative Relief Committee" initially delayed delivery and then used the excuse of an order to suspend sales, and will therefore accuse the "Administrative Relief Committee" of breach of contract.</p>
<p>The reporter then inquired about this matter with a person in charge of the "Administrative Relief Committee," who stated: The cooperative had previously applied to the "Administrative Relief Committee" for the purchase of flour, and the "Administrative Relief Committee" responded by referring to the flour purchase method published in the newspapers at that time, instructing them to pay and collect the goods at the designated bank. The cooperative failed to make the payment within the stipulated time. By the time the payment was made, the method for bulk purchase of flour had already been suspended, and the "Administrative Relief Committee" was unable to make an exception to sell the flour. The "Administrative Relief Committee" only sent a letter to the cooperative informing them of the flour purchase method, and did not enter into any sales contract with the cooperative.</p>

<h3>Parricidal Son Kills His Mother During a Mental Episode</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In the Taoyuanfang lane, 150 North Jiangxi Road, an elderly Cantonese woman, Tan Feng, over seventy years old, had a son named Xi Li, forty years old, who suffered from a mental illness. Sometimes he would have episodes, cursing and hitting people arbitrarily. At 1:30 PM yesterday, he used an iron rod to injure his mother's head, causing her to faint and fall to the ground. The neighbors reported to the Hongkou Police Station. Criminal Investigator Yan Chang and an officer went to investigate and took the parricidal son back to the branch for questioning.

<h3>Overdue Registration Fees Temporarily Waived, Director of the Land Administration Bureau Zhu Ping Implements New Policies</h3>
<p>The offices and departments of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau and the Land Registration Offices simultaneously conducted handovers yesterday. Applications for registration from property owners were still accepted as usual and were not affected by the handover. In order to reduce the burden on property owners and accelerate the completion of land registration, Director Zhu will reduce or waive various administrative fees. For example, the fee for land title deeds was originally set at a minimum of 100 yuan and a maximum of 10,000 yuan per document. This has now been changed to a minimum of 2 yuan and a maximum of only 100 yuan per document. Furthermore, the Bureau began charging a 10% overdue registration fee starting on March 19th of this year, and an additional 20% starting on May 19th, totaling 30%. Director Zhu believes that while it is regrettable that property owners have failed to apply for registration within the time limit, it is also due to unavoidable circumstances, as transportation has not yet returned to normal since the victory of the War of Resistance. Therefore, in order to encourage property owners to quickly complete registration, the originally scheduled overdue registration fees will be temporarily waived to alleviate the hardships of the people.</p>
<h3>Three Thieves Rob a Household, Losses Amount to Tens of Millions</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] At 376 Yongjia Road, the homeowner, Mr. Wang, was visited by three thieves at around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday. The thieves used a sand-filled fire extinguisher to force open the back door, entered the house, and two of them brandished handguns, herding the men and women in the house into one room, where one of the thieves guarded them. The remaining thief forced Mr. Wang to hand over the key to the safe, and proceeded to loot the house, stealing approximately fifteen taels of gold, a small diamond ring, and US$5,000 in bills, for a total loss of approximately 40 to 50 million yuan. The three thieves then fled. The homeowner reported the crime to the police station and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>Labor Disputes Rise and Fall, Labor-Management Negotiations Break Down Repeatedly, Candle Shop is Destroyed, There are Still Problems with the Tramway, Aviation and Electricity Industries Request Adjustments</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A labor dispute has also arisen in the city's candle industry. Mediation was attempted at the Social Affairs Bureau at 2:00 PM yesterday, but no result was achieved. At around 7:30 PM, workers suddenly stormed into the Renchangzhai Candle Shop (established by Huang Yong-chuan, executive director of the Candle Industry Association) at 498 Nanjing Road, next to the Hong Miao Temple, destroying display windows, candles, light bulbs, and other items, causing significant losses. At 5:00 PM, the Xinyuanfeng Candle Shop (established by Tong Yuan-xiao, chairman of the Candle Industry Association) at 588 Zhongzheng East Road was also stormed and destroyed by workers. Upon receiving the report, the Lao Zha Branch Bureau dispatched a large number of police officers and patrol teams, led by Branch Director Shi, to suppress the unrest. More than a dozen workers involved in the incident were arrested on the spot and taken back to the bureau.</p>
<p>Tramway: The British-owned tramway has now fully resumed operations, and tramcars on all routes have resumed service. Regarding the workers' request for a loan of 100,000 yuan, Mr. Wu Kai-xian and Mr. Zhu Xue-fan will be responsible for handling it within the next few days. The cancellation of the increase in employees' base salaries and the restoration of the annual seniority-based salary increase method are still subject to negotiation with the employer. However, a new difficulty has now emerged, namely, the workers' demand that all wages be paid in full for the period of the strike, which has not been agreed to by the employer, and the General Labor Union believes that there is no precedent for this. How this issue will be resolved remains unknown.</p>
<p>Aviation: Ground personnel and mechanics of the China National Aviation Corporation, with monthly incomes of only 110,000 to 120,000 yuan, which is insufficient to cover their expenses, have requested the authorities to adjust their compensation. Office workers of the company also share the same sentiment. However, the company has stated that its current fare revenue is limited, and its current expenses already result in monthly losses, so it is unable to further adjust compensation. It is heard that if the Chinese employees of the company do not receive a response regarding the adjustment of compensation today, they are likely to take action.</p>
<p>Telecommunications: All employees of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and the International Radio Station, under pressure from their living conditions, jointly petitioned the authorities yesterday to promptly improve their compensation. The bureau's employees, considering the importance of the telecommunications industry, are maintaining operations while simultaneously petitioning, and are not resorting to strike action. It is heard that the bureau's director, Bing Jian, and the station's chief engineer, Lu Yucheng, traveled to Nanjing last night to request instructions from the transportation authorities.</p>
<p>Tailoring: The labor dispute in the tailoring industry has been resolved through the mediation of Mr. Zhu Xue-fan, and the workers have decided to resume work today and await a reasonable resolution.</p>

According to the Customs Administration Office of the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River, the Navy's Second Fleet Command announced that the mine had been removed on the 15th of this month, and all shipping companies have been notified.</p>
<h3>DDT: Beware of Counterfeits, Exposing the "Foreign Mirror," Many Fake Products on the Market, Labeled as "American-Made" Cause Great Harm, Chemical Analysis Reveals it is just a Bottle of Kerosene</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The people of Shanghai, living in pigeon-hole-like houses, have long suffered from mosquitoes, bedbugs, and fleas. Now, upon hearing that DDT, with its insecticidal power, has arrived in China from the United States, it is like "scratching an itch," and it has been immediately welcomed by the masses.</p>
<p>Bottled in golden-yellow American-style beer bottles, with exquisitely designed labels stating that they are products of a certain American pharmaceutical factory, and claiming that the DDT content is above 10%, the bottles are neatly and brightly stacked on the stalls selling "American-made equipment" on Sichuan Road, the Bund, Zhongzheng Road, Lloyd Road, Albert Road, and Linsen Road. Tobacco shops and small pharmacies have also joined the bandwagon. The price ranges from 1,800 yuan to 2,500 yuan per bottle, and some even offer a free sprayer. The people of Shanghai are eager to kill insects and also love novelties, so everyone buys a bottle, and DDT has become extremely profitable and popular.</p>
<p>However, clever Shanghainese, you have been deceived! The reporter purchased ten samples of DDT from various places and sent them to experts for chemical analysis. The results showed that nine out of ten of these self-proclaimed American products are fake. Some are simply kerosene, and only one or two bottles contain DDT, with a content of only about 3%. As for the American factory names, most of them are fabricated, and some even have spelling and grammatical errors. The genuine American DDT powder is not yet widely available in the market, and even official institutions are experiencing shortages, so how can it be widely sold in the market!</p>
<p>It must be said again that the people of Shanghai have heard too much about the promotion of DDT, and only know how great its ability to kill insects is, but do not know its details, so it is no wonder that they are being deceived en masse. The reporter is here to provide some common sense about DDT for readers' reference.</p>
<p>DDT Common Sense</p>
<p>First, pure DDT powder is very difficult to dissolve. Even in kerosene, it can only dissolve up to 5%. The common fakes that claim to contain 10% are false advertisements.</p>
<p>Second, DDT itself is colorless and odorless, so its solution cannot be distinguished by sight or smell alone, unless it is sent to an expert for chemical analysis.</p>
<p>Third, DDT does not kill insects instantly, but once insects come into contact with DDT, they will be poisoned, then paralyzed and die. Flies and mosquitoes die within about half an hour. Bedbugs take several hours to die, and cockroaches take about a week to die.</p>
<p>However, the greatest benefit of DDT is that its insecticidal persistence is very long. The best DDT can maintain its insecticidal power for about six months. Although DDT is harmless to humans, food and vegetables are best not sprayed with DDT. In particular, liquid DDT should never be sprayed near stoves or kitchen ranges to avoid causing fires.</p>
<p>So, is there no real DDT in this city? That is not entirely true. Fortunately, several well-known Chinese-owned pharmaceutical factories are also imitating it. According to chemical analysis results, the effectiveness is also very good. Clever Shanghainese, please do not blindly believe in those self-proclaimed American DDT products, as these domestic DDT products have some effectiveness and composition of DDT. If you don't want to be fooled, please look for the trademark when you buy it. (Photo shows the sale of DDT on street stalls and in tobacco shops, taken by Yu Chuangshuo of this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Counterfeiters Will Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Recently, it has been discovered that counterfeit DDT drugs are being sold on the market. According to the person in charge of the Food and Drug Testing Institute of the Health Bureau, all new drugs, regardless of type, must be registered with the Health Bureau. There are over a hundred types of DDT currently flooding the market, none of which have been formally registered, which is a fundamental violation of regulations. Those who counterfeit and reduce the quality of materials to deceive citizens will be strictly investigated and punished. DDT is an external medicine, and its danger is relatively small. However, the harm to citizens caused by the sale of counterfeit internal medicines on the market is not insignificant. On the one hand, we will crack down on them, and on the other hand, we hope that citizens will pay attention.</p>
<p>The institute has received ten types of DDT purchased from stores and stalls on the market by the Medical and Pharmaceutical Administration of the Health Bureau for chemical analysis. After the testing is completed in a week, the results will be reported to the authorities. If counterfeiting is found, a formal lawsuit will be filed in court or investigated jointly with the police station. All other types of DDT will be sampled and tested one by one to prevent unscrupulous merchants from harming the public.</p>
<h3>A Batch of US Navy Landing Craft are Ordered to be Transferred to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, A Total of Four Vessels Were Received Yesterday and Today, Will Operate on Coastal and Yangtze River Routes</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A batch of landing craft from the US Navy, including 15 LSMs and 10 LSTs, have been ordered to be transferred to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The company was ordered to receive LSM 112 and 248 yesterday. The Shipping Department notified in advance the receiving procedures: (1) All captains will have lunch at the Bureau (i.e., the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company) Room 503 at 1:30 PM (yesterday). (2) Depart at 1:30 PM, the crew of 112 will gather on the Flying Shanghai Ferry. The crew of 248 will gather on the National Capital Ferry. (3) Receive 112 first, then receive 248. (4) At 1:55 PM, the US military will read the handover order on 112, and the Bureau's representative will read the receiving order, and the national flag will be changed at the same time. (5) After the receiving is completed, receive 248, and the same procedure will be followed. (6) Receive the LST tomorrow (i.e., today). The same procedure will be followed. Numbers 804 and 929 will be presided over by Huang Muzong, Director of the Shipping Department, in person. 112 has been renamed Hua 101, with Captain Shen Jichun, First Mate Lu Shengfen, and Second Mate Huang Zhenchun. 248 has been renamed Hua 102, with Captain Xi Pixun, First Mate Zhang Yanduo, and Second Mate Huang Chaoyou. Vessel 929 is Captained by Lu Xiaomin, First Mate Shi Tinghuai, and Second Mate Sa Shihong. The landing craft, including 15 LSMs, each displacing over 1,000 tons, will be dispatched to the Yangtze River route. The 10 LSTs, each displacing approximately 3,000 tons, will be dispatched to the coastal routes. The Bureau was previously ordered to inspect the US landing craft in Little Luzon. Yan Hongfu was sent to investigate. A telegram has now been received with details, but it is heard that the ships are scattered in various ports, and it will take a long time to inspect them. They will not be able to return to Shanghai in the short term.</p>
<h3>Hu Xiyuan Discusses that Tax Regulations Enacted During the Emergency Period Should Be Abolished, and Attention Should Be Paid to Fair Tax Standards</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A reporter specially visited Mr. Hu Xiyuan, a leader in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles and general manager of the Asia Electric Factory, yesterday to inquire about his opinions on the matter of Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles requesting the government to abolish various tax regulations enacted during the emergency period and to exempt various emergency tax revenues for the 34th year of the Republic. He stated that various tax revenues enacted during the emergency period were originally laws to increase revenue during wartime, and should be abolished from this year onwards. As for the exemption of various emergency tax revenues for the 34th year of the Republic, Mr. Hu stated that he had only been in Shanghai for two months and was not fully aware of the financial situation in the recovered areas. However, for industrial and commercial circles in the rear areas, a portion of the various emergency period tax revenues for the government in the past year have already been paid, and the war lasted until August of the past year, so most of it still belonged to the emergency period. Therefore, there is no fundamental objection to the government collecting various emergency tax revenues for the past year. As for the Guangfu area requesting exemption due to complex circumstances, it is a special exception, and Mr. Hu did not express an opinion on this. As for simplifying the tax collection issue, Mr. Hu advocated striving for silence as much as possible. For example, during the period when the capital was in Chongqing, the authorities often used the previous year's losses as the standard for estimating the tax revenue for the current year, which seems unfair. Furthermore, representatives from the majority of industry associations should participate in the valuation and provide more opinions to make the valuation fair. The integrity of the investigators sent out by the direct tax bureau should be strictly monitored. If corruption is discovered, it should be severely punished, and the victims should be allowed to report the facts confidentially without disclosing their names.</p>
<h3>The House of the Industrial and Commercial News Agency Was Forcibly Occupied, Requesting a Stop to the Occupation</h3>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial News Agency is preparing to resume publication in Shanghai and rented 320 Albert Road as its office address.

They also brought a mortar and several suitcases and luggage and lived inside, forcing the news agency to move elsewhere. In order to protect its legitimate right to residence and for safety, the news agency has submitted a request to the garrison commander to effectively stop the occupation.</p>

<h3>Chen Guoquan, Head of the Puppet Rice and Grain Control Association, Tried; Greasy-Haired and Not Admitting Guilt; Discovery of Conscience: Lao Yinyu Expresses Shame</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Guoquan, the head of the puppet Rice and Grain Control Association, used the name of "control" to carry out monopolistic practices during his tenure. He bought rice and grain at low prices, causing the bankruptcy of rural areas in the occupied territories and making it difficult for the people to eat. Therefore, the High Prosecutor's Office charged him with conspiring with the enemy, supplying and selling, and purchasing, handling, and transporting rice grains. Chen, a traitor from Zhongshan County, Guangdong, is 57 years old, but he is neatly dressed in a Western suit with shiny hair, still resembling a bank manager. According to his confession, he joined the puppet regime entirely because of the invitation from the traitor Tang 潄民, and he was forced to take office. It was an unavoidable situation. During his tenure in the puppet position, he did his best to fight for rice and grain for the citizens of Shanghai and did not commit treason. After a detailed inquiry in court, the judge adjourned the hearing for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Lao Yinyu</p>
<p>From Kaiping, Guangdong, 37 years old, studied in Japan and graduated from the Economics Department of Tokyo Imperial University. He knew the great traitor Chen 君　. He joined the puppet organization in 1940 and successively served as the secretary of the puppet Economic Committee, the director of the Shanghai Office, the director of the Shanghai Office of the puppet Construction Department, the price appraisal chief of the puppet Industry Department, and the director of the puppet Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau until the victory. According to his confession: "I am truly ashamed to say that I was careless for a moment and was pulled into the water by others. Although it was not for promotion or wealth, but just for survival, I always felt sorry for my conscience, so I voluntarily accept legal sanctions." The judge rebuked, "You studied abroad at public expense for many years. How could you bear to join the puppet government after returning to China!" Lao confessed, "After returning from Japan, I went to Hong Kong to open a bookstore, but the business was bad and I closed it down at a loss, so I came to Shanghai." After the judge asked about his factory work, he answered each question accurately, and the judge adjourned the hearing for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Sun Yunzhang</p>
<p>From Hangzhou, 47 years old, served as a civil servant for many years before the war. During the Anti-Japanese War, he came to the furnace and was instructed by Fu Shishuo. In the spring of 1940, when the traitor Wang Jingwei organized the puppet government, 潄逆 was the head of the puppet Ministry of Railways, and Sun served as the secretary of the ministry. When Fu was transferred to be the chairman of the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Government, Sun was transferred to be the secretary-general. The following year, when the organization was reorganized, Sun became the director of the puppet Department of Political Affairs. In the spring and summer of the following year, he also served as a member of the puppet Central Economic Committee, loyally promoting the credit orders of the puppet regime until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Sun stubbornly denied the crime when the trial began.</p>
<p>Ma Suiliang</p>
<p>From Jiangyin, 34 years old, after the Anti-Japanese War, he served as a staff member of the Third Hall of the puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, managing the registration of personnel organization for two years. Later, he served as the leader and deputy leader of the investigation team in Kunshan, Changshu, and other places. Under the command of the puppet agent Wang Lishi Qun, he specialized in killing, sabotage, and arresting patriotic people. After the victory, he was arrested by the military authorities and sent to the High Court for legal proceedings. According to his statement, the department had four halls: General Affairs, Intelligence, Organization, and Supervision. The special agent affairs were handled by the Special Agent Headquarters, so he cunningly argued that he was only a clerical staff member and was not responsible for the crimes he was accused of.</p>
<p>Wang Genyuan</p>
<p>A freight car worker at the Qishuyan Machine Factory, he served as a road management policeman at the puppet Qishuyan Station in July 1944, extorting employees and travelers, which was extremely bad. After the victory, he was jointly reported by the employees there. However, the defendant refused to admit the crimes he committed. The above three cases were also inquired in detail, and the hearing was adjourned for further interrogation. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders This Year's Graduates to Continue to Temporarily Suspend Joint Examinations</h3>
<p>[Xinhua News Agency Kunming Report] Due to various restrictions during the Anti-Japanese War, it was difficult to organize joint graduation examinations for middle school students in various provinces and cities, so they were temporarily suspended. As for the issue of joint examinations for this year's graduates, the Ministry of Education has wired various provinces and cities to temporarily suspend them again, given the transportation difficulties during the current period of recovery. The Yunnan Provincial Department of Education has already received the order and immediately notified various schools. This year's graduates will still conduct strict examinations within the school, and the Department of Education will send personnel to supervise the examinations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Specialized College Association Declares Improvement of University Professor Treatment</h3>
<p>[Local News] The Shanghai Specialized College and University Association issued a declaration for the movement to improve the treatment of professors at national universities in Shanghai, stating that: University professors are different from ordinary civil servants. Professors are dedicated to research and cultivating specialized talents. Their mission is sacred. The government should allow them to work in peace and be willing to make education a lifelong career. Therefore, they cannot be equated with general civil servants. For education, for the country, and for the nation, we must first seek to improve the treatment of professors.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Ordered to Recover Primary School Buildings</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau recently received an order from the Ministry of Education: If local primary school buildings are borrowed by military and government agencies, they should negotiate with the borrowing agency to recover the school buildings as soon as possible to restore schools and help out-of-school children.</p>
<h3>Citywide Students Launch Teacher Respect Fundraising Movement on a Regular Basis; Private School Teachers Request Issuance of Teacher Respect Money</h3>
<p>[Local News] The Municipal Education Bureau previously contacted leaders from all walks of life to launch a teacher respect movement. Although there has been considerable progress in the past month, it is still far from the goal. Therefore, the fundraising movement of middle and high school students in the city is launched again. It is now scheduled for the 27th and 28th of this month, from 8 AM to 6 PM, when student fundraising teams will solicit donations from various stores. The method is that each school has at least one team, each team has four groups, each group has four people, responsible for donation books, donation receipts, and other duties. After the donations are collected, the Education Bureau will repay bank loans and allocate funds to municipal school teachers and some extremely poor private school teachers. It is also reported that private school teachers and students in the city are also enthusiastically participating to promote the spirit of love and mutual assistance. The principals of each school are scheduled to go to the Education Bureau in the next two days to collect donation books, receipts, and other items.</p>
<p>[Additional News] All members of the Shanghai Primary School Teachers' Union and other three groups recently saw in the newspapers that municipal school teachers will receive 40,000 yuan in teacher respect subsidies, but private school teachers were not mentioned. This is inconsistent with what the Director said last time: "When municipal schools issue the second subsidy or teacher respect money, private school teachers will receive the same treatment." The group and others requested to send representatives Ge Zhicheng, Wang Luzhi, etc., to bring a petition to visit the Director for inquiries. The Director was away on official business, and Director Zhu received them on his behalf. When the representatives asked, Director Zhu replied that the municipal schools' current teacher respect money is based on the amount of teacher respect money donated by each school. The largest amount is 40,000 yuan, and the smallest amount is 5,000 yuan. As for the teacher respect money raised from outside, it has not been used, and after the teacher respect movement ends, the teacher respect money must be distributed equally to public and private school teachers, and the amount issued by the municipal schools will also be deducted.</p>

<h3>The Second Act of the Big Four Basketball Tournament: Xi Qing Defeated by Signal; Lianghua Defeats Shantou Team Last Night; Lingjie Tongfa Team Defeats Reporters; Tan Jing Generously Donates 500,000 Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>The second act of the Big Four Championship Basketball Tournament continued at the City Stadium last night. Before the game, there was a subplot of reporters against the Lingjie (Performing Arts) organization's Tongfa team. The total audience was more than 2,000 people, and the situation was still enthusiastic.</p>
<p>At 6 o'clock sharp, the reporters and Tongfa first took the stage. Tongfa's Zhang Chunfu opened the scoring with a free throw. Reporters Zhang Guochun and Cao Zhengwei made two shots and led 4-1. Li Zongyi and Zhao Zongzheng repeatedly made great contributions. In the first quarter, Tongfa came from behind with 11 to 8. In the second quarter, Wang Weijun and Qian Xuchang of the reporter's team were very active, but at the end of the first half, the reporters were still behind with 19 to 22. After switching sides, reporter Zhou Jun showed his skills and scored repeatedly. At the end of the third quarter, the reporters exceeded with 35 to 33. In the last quarter, the competition became more intense, resulting in three ties. As a result, each team got 40 points and shook hands and made peace.</p>
<p>Following that, in the championship game, Signal vs. Xi Qing, Xi Qing led by two points with 20 to 18 at the end of the first half. Signal reversed the defeat with 39 to 33 at the end of the game.</p>
<p>In the final showdown, Lianghua vs. Shantou team, Lianghua's Shen Yukong showed his power from the start, scoring twice. Li Zhenzhong scored two consecutive goals. Lianghua's momentum was very strong. Tang Baokun was fouled five times and was eliminated when the score was 18 to 10. Liu Fushan replaced him. Shen Yukong was still comfortable and broke through the basket again and again. Shantou team's Lin Weicong and He Lide also gained something. At the end of the first half, Lianghua took the lead with 25 to 17.</p>
<p>During the break, Liu Hesheng reported that Mr. Tan Jing, director of Donghua Association, had generously donated 500,000 yuan. In addition, the organizer announced that 56 honorary seats were sold for 10,000 yuan per ticket, 761 tickets were sold for 2,000 yuan, and 462 tickets were sold for 1,000 yuan, for a total income of 2,544,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The two teams fought hard and made progress and retreated from each other. Soon Lianghua's Ge Ke also fouled out and graduated. Wu Bixian entered the arena. Lianghua adopted a slow tactic. Chen Qingjiang of the Shantou team gradually entered a good state, 23 to 29, only six points apart. The performance after entering became more tense. In the last minute, the Oil Team chased to 37 to 39. At this time, the battle situation had become fierce. Lianghua Geng Zhong skillfully passed to Bixian, who happened to be under the basket and scored a reverse hit, thus establishing the victory. Lianghua won two games and two victories with 41 to 37.</p>

<h3>American New Invention: Braille Typewriter</h3>
<p>Can Write 140 Words Per Minute</p>
<p>[US Information Office Boston Report, 22nd] The Christian Science Monitor recently stated that Dr. Peng Tenkeks of San Diego, California, has invented a pocket-sized Braille typewriter. After training, blind people can use this typewriter to record 140 words per minute. The Monitor stated that this Braille typewriter is being prepared for mass production. Each typewriter weighs only 18 ounces and can be hidden in a man's overcoat pocket or a woman's purse. It is also equipped with a narrow tape, which is sufficient for several hours of recording. Dr. Penkes said that there are at least 72,000 blind people in the United States, and he estimates that 60,000 of them can learn to use this Braille typewriter. He also reported that although this new invention has not been heavily publicized, he has received more than 1,000 letters from all walks of life in the United Kingdom and South America, preparing to order this typewriter.</p>
<h3>National Taiwan University</h3>
<p>— Yang Naifan</p>
<p>The predecessor of National Taiwan University was Taipei Imperial University during the Japanese colonial period in Taiwan. It has a history of more than forty years since its establishment. Because Japan regarded Taiwan as a base for its southward advance, and NTU was the main camp for researching the southward policy, the Japanese spared no effort in operating the university. Its professors were all top-notch experts from Japan. The campus has more than twenty grand Western-style buildings, and the library has more than 500,000 books. Other mechanical equipment, specimens, and instruments are also substantial in content, far surpassing those of other universities in our country. The affiliated Southern Resources Research Institute, Tropical Science Research Institute, Southern Language Research Institute, and other institutions, from the standpoint of supporting Japan's southward policy, are particularly characteristic of the school.</p>
<p>The school is divided into six colleges: Liberal Arts, Law, Science, Agriculture, Engineering, and Medicine. Except for the College of Medicine, which is located in Dongmen Town in the central area of Taipei, all other departments are in Shuidao Town in the suburbs. In the past, the total number of students was more than 1,200, with less than 200 Taiwanese students. Moreover, more than 150 of these 200 were medical students, with only a few distributed in the Colleges of Agriculture and Engineering because the Japanese did not allow Taiwanese to study advanced academics. Now, the Japanese students have all been sent back. The remaining students, excluding the College of Medicine, total only 29 in all other colleges. Because very few people have come from within the country, the professors have no choice but to keep the Japanese professors. It is truly a miracle that such a well-equipped, large-scale school has neither students nor faculty.</p>
<p>In the final stages of the war, Taiwan University also suffered severe bombing. All the glass windows of the entire school building were destroyed, and some houses were pierced or had leaks. In addition, due to the chaos that occurred after the Japanese surrender and before our government took over, the loss of school equipment, instruments, specimens, and the like was quite significant. Theft by petty thieves was also quite serious. We saw several large cabinets displaying animal skeletal specimens, all of which were extremely valuable. The Japanese staff in charge, unable to care for them, posted a note next to the cabinets, which roughly said: "The items in the cabinet cannot be sold for money on the market. Please do not take them away." This is another miracle.</p>
<p>In the past, Taiwan's education system only had four years of middle school. To enter university, one had to take two years of preparatory courses. Therefore, NTU established a preparatory class, which now has 492 students.</p>
<p>Taiwan's scenery is beautiful, life is stable, and Taiwan University has excellent facilities. At the same time, post-recovery Taiwan needs a large number of talents for construction. If many ambitious young people in Shanghai are interested in developing abroad, then trying to apply to Taiwan University during the summer vacation is a very good option.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers: Medicine and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Yang Yitao asks: I have long admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for public welfare and benefiting the people. I am deeply grateful. My younger brother has become acquainted with a girlfriend and their feelings are very strong. However, she suffered from lymphatic tuberculosis (commonly known as scrofula) on her neck four or five years ago. Initially, she mistakenly trusted a village doctor to perform surgery, which was ineffective. Later, she was cured by exposure to sunlight. Now she is healthy as ever, and her lungs have also been X-rayed with no problems. I implore you to answer: (1) Can it recur in the future? (2) If they marry, will it be hereditary to their offspring? (3) Is it still contagious? (4) What methods of recuperation should be taken in the future to completely eradicate the root cause?</p>
<p>(Answer by Dr. Yu Xinen): (1) If you take good care of yourself, it should not recur. (2) There is no direct heredity. (3) If the X-ray of the lungs is clear, then it is not contagious. (4) Do not work too hard, pay attention to nutrition, and live a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>(2) Zhang Meiying asks: I am seventeen years old. Hard nodules have been growing on my neck since two years ago, i.e. scrofula. I have six or seven nodules now, and repeated diagnoses have been ineffective. I am suffering greatly. I have long admired that your newspaper is sold all over the world. I do not know if there is any fundamental cure in the world. Because I am a girl, my family is poor and I have no father. I rely on my mother to make ends meet. I hope that wise people will tell me. I am extremely grateful.</p>
<p>(Answer by Dr. Yu Xinen): You need to be irradiated with deep X-rays. The Municipal Fourth Hospital (No. 142 North Sichuan Road) in this city has this equipment. We can introduce you to go there for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>(3) Liu Zhe asks: (1) My mother is fifty-one years old, and her head often shakes involuntarily (commonly known as shaking head madness). (2) Her hands, face, and arms often develop red, extremely itchy patches when exposed to wind or cold water. What diseases are these two symptoms? Are there any special needles and medications? Please advise.</p>
<p>(Answer by Dr. Yu Xinen): (1) The disease is called convulsions. You need to find the source of the disease. If it is in the central nervous system, you can try taking brain-calming agents or performing spinal nerve transection surgery, which is sometimes effective. (2) The disease is called urticaria, which is caused by stimulation. You need to avoid cold wind and cold water stimulation.</p>
<p>(4) Qiu Zhenzhi asks: My younger brother is 26 years old, married, and studying in the interior. For the past six months, his eyes have often had many blood streaks in the whites of his eyes. If he works a little longer, they turn red and feel dry. He also sees black shadows from time to time. Also, on both sides of the black pupils of his left eye, there are pterygia. Please provide details on the name of the disease, the treatment method, and the consequences of delayed treatment.</p>
<p>(Answer by Dr. Yu Xinen): A detailed examination by an ophthalmologist is required. If it is a pterygium, it can be surgically removed.</p>
<p>Suggestions for the Respect Teachers Movement</p>
<p>Editor: Enthusiastic people in this city, considering the recent difficult living conditions and the meager salaries of teachers in various schools, have established organizations such as the Respect Teachers Movement to raise funds from all walks of life to improve the lives of teachers, so that educators can be content in their positions and students can receive excellent teaching. During this period of national financial strain, we, as citizens, should be happy to donate to see it succeed. I have two points to make: First, the fundraising units seem too complicated. Yesterday, a friend and I met a student from a private girls' school in a teahouse who came to raise funds. The receipt they issued was printed vaguely and the amount was filled in carelessly (written in pencil without leaving a copy). Knowing that the visitors were all enthusiastic students, I still felt that the procedures were too simple, which inevitably made people suspicious. Second, various private schools are collecting the second installment of tuition and miscellaneous fees. According to my children's report yesterday, 70-80% of the children in the whole school have had to drop out of school because they cannot afford the fees due to their poor families. The first point involves personnel matters, but the result at least hinders fundraising success and affects teachers' income. The second point is indeed a social problem. I think that there are many private schools in Shanghai, and there must be many schools with the same situation as my children's school. Isn't it too pitiful that school-age children drop out of school halfway through? I have long admired Mr. Editor's service to the community and enthusiasm for public welfare. For this point, I hope you will speak out and ask the local education authorities or philanthropists to provide effective assistance, at least to request the private school authorities to make special accommodations for these students who cannot afford the second installment of tuition fees, and allow them to continue their studies. The students would be very fortunate, and society would be very fortunate. I wish you good health. From Lai Dingquan.</p>

<h3>Tight Money Loosens, Pressure Increases, Gold Market Price Hike Hindered, US Dollars and Hong Kong Notes Both Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the renewed pressure from the Bank of China, the market atmosphere was hindered and a slight reaction was seen. It showed a slight setback as soon as it opened in the morning. However, buyers were still trying to nibble. After the Bank of China released chips, it gradually fell from 1.94 million. Around 10 o'clock, it retreated to 1.89 million. The Bank of China allocated to over 110 gold businesses at a price of 1.885 million, which was slightly lower than the market price, the only time in recent days. The multiple sides felt oppressed and once fell to around 1.88 million. With the loose money, there was still some support at low prices, and it rose slightly to 1.9 million. At noon, it was still hovering around the allocated price. In the afternoon, the spot delivery once rose to 1.9 million and a few odd figures. The result was a drop of 55,000 compared to the previous closing. After 2 o'clock, the next-day delivery was again pressed down to 1.88 million. Gold ornaments are listed at 10,000, silver is flat, and silver coins are rising again. The underground interest rate is even looser, with interest rates at around 15%.</p>
<p>The foreign currency US dollar situation was mediocre. After opening, the gold market fell back, and it gradually declined from 2420 yuan to around 2380 yuan. After entering, it advanced and retreated between 2390 yuan and 2400 yuan. The situation was extremely stable. In the afternoon, it was slightly dragged down by the gold market. The result was a drop of 50 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes also fell 5 yuan, Hong Kong telegraph at 435 yuan, rupees at 535 yuan, both with supply. The US exchange rate remained flat, with the designated bank selling price at 2100. There were not many settlements either.</p>
<h3>Short Covering Continues, Government Bond Situation Becomes Firmer</h3>
<p>The government bond situation remains stable. Short positions are continuously covering. The general psychology follows the big players and tends to be optimistic. Tong Bing opened at 6750 yuan in the morning. Demand and supply were relatively balanced. It once retreated from 6850 yuan to 6650 yuan. Short positions covered, and the situation became firmer. At noon, all were at high prices (more than 100 yuan higher than the closing price). The result was another rise of 300 yuan compared to the previous closing. Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu also improved slightly.</p>
<h3>Rayon Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Mill-made Silk Fabrics Fall Again</p>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market was firm in the morning and rose again in the afternoon. 120號 Tianqiao first opened at 1.43 million yuan. Until closing, there was not much change. This week, because the goods opened by China Textile Company last Saturday were mostly without boxes and not original packages, the market price uniformly increased. Tianqiao quoted 1.478 million yuan, an increase of 780,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other brands also rose. Only 150 miscellaneous brands had poor price. It was sold at 230,000 yuan in the morning and 250,000 yuan in the afternoon. Mill silk 83 points high evenness was quoted at 2.6 million yuan, 78 points high evenness at 2.4 million yuan. There were transactions. Other grades of user silk and經俱 were short of about 100,000 yuan. Silk fabric market prices also fell. American-made bedspreads were short 20,000 yuan per hundred. Dacheng checkered crepe was sold at 4,050 yuan per yard in the morning and 3,960 yuan in the afternoon, a decrease of 140-150 yuan compared to the day before.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Refined Tribute Tea Hoards Goods</h3>
<p>Wuyuan refined tribute tea, Indian Mumbai has considerable demand for high-quality teas. Therefore, even Japanese 白頭行家 have intentions to import. However, holders of the goods are hoarding them because they believe the market stock is running out, resulting in a gradual decrease in supply and difficult transactions. The situation is quite good. As for domestic sales of various designs, Tianjin merchants are not very active. However, the distribution from shops and merchants in this street and places like Suzhou and Wuxi has not weakened yet. Because the situation is quite peaceful for both buyers and sellers, it is still able to maintain stability.</p>
<h3>Spot Supply Falls Short of Demand, Yarn and Thread Rise Uniformly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market was quite outstanding. The volume from Tianjin merchants has improved. Domestic sales on this street are also strong. Therefore, the price of each type of yarn rose by 120,000 or so. Because the Fangjian Company only sold to manufacturers on the previous day for 42-count double-ply yarn, without supplying any to yarn merchants, the thread price rose by 350,000. Although there are no large transactions in the current yarn market, the spot supply is still insufficient. With small purchases being made gradually from all sides, 20-count spot yarn is often out of stock. Therefore, people in the industry predict that the yarn price may have a surprising development when shipping routes are clear on all sides in the future.</p>
<p>The cotton market: New York American cotton rose sharply by 22-29 points. Nearby US dollars were at 27.60, forward at 28.24, and middling spot at 28.21. The local spot cotton market is still firm, but transactions have decreased slightly. Shenxin No. 6 Factory imported Brazilian cotton and Uruguayan cotton, Dasheng Factory imported Pengjiapo cotton, and Sulun imported 白洛去 cotton.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Continue to Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>New Company's Goods Can Be Opened Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, with the auction of enemy-produced goods and the Taiwan New Company scheduled to open sugar goods today, the market trend softened. The Association's initial划盤 price for medium-grain white sugar was 72,000 yuan, dropping to a minimum of 69,000 yuan, then rising back to 72,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it hovered around 71,000 yuan, later at 71,500 yuan, a decrease of 34,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The auctioned goods included 840 bags of raw sugar, at 58,000 yuan,兌通. Four and a half cars of white sugar, over 900 bags, at 88,000 yuan, 327 bags plus 66 sacks, all at full price兌通. The sellers offered Shanmian赤高 goods at 72,000 yuan, followed by 67-8,000 yuan, Shang Diaoqing at 51,000 yuan to 50,500 yuan, followed by 50,000 to 49,500 yuan, and No. 3 yellow ice at 86,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold and Diamonds: South Africa's Rich Treasures</h3>
<p>Reuter's Dispatch from Cape Town, 22nd: South Africa's Minister of Mines Mr.斯特森 stated yesterday in the Senate that the future of the gold mining business in the Orange Free State is limitless. Its ore deposits are the richest of all the gold mines in South Africa. It is expected that nine new mines will be established in the province in the near future, or perhaps thirteen. Mr. 華氏 also stated that the future of South Africa's gold and diamond business is also very bright. The diamonds worth £14,000,000 that were in stock before the war, and those mined during the war, have all been sold. The world market seems likely to buy all of South Africa's diamonds in a considerable period of time.</p>

<h3>Speculative Funds Tend Towards Popular Stocks, More Chinese and Foreign Stocks Rise Than Fall</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks: The financial community made a move on popular stocks, and short sellers in the industry were forced to cover. Yongsha's highest price was 5350 yuan, and Meiya's was 4250 yuan, and then slightly fell. Small stocks were unpopular because speculative funds tended towards popular stocks. Jingfu was the most inferior. Although the high prices of Xinguang and Qinxing were difficult to maintain, their situation was better than Jingfu because there were buyers. At noon, compared to the previous closing, Yongsha and Meiya each rose by half a cent, Jingfu fell slightly, and Xinguang and Qinxing rose by half a cent and slightly, respectively. Medium-sized stocks also recovered slightly, and veteran stocks still lacked vitality. Foreign stocks: Big players from the bond market moved over and suddenly competed to buy. Yisha opened in the morning and jumped to around 3500 yuan. It rose by more than 100 yuan in the middle and then fell slightly. The result was that the two popular stocks Yisha and American-Chinese each rose by one cent. Except for Paper Industry, Yeguang also rose by one cent. The rise of the remaining stocks was limited.</p>
<h3>Timber Transactions Are Sluggish</h3>
<p>Over 800,000 Feet of Foreign Pine Arrives</p>

<p>Reuter's Dispatch from Argentina's capital, 23rd: Argentina's Ministry of Agricultural Production Regulation reported yesterday that the previous sale of 50,000 tons of wheat to China at a price of 35 pesos per 100 kilograms has now been decided to be approved.</p>
<h3>Gansu Gasoline Production Increases</h3>
<p>Reaches 2 Million Gallons Within Half a Year</p>
<p>Gansu Oilfield is the best-managed in the country. According to statistics, there are a total of 61 wells, of which 13 are currently producing oil. The crude oil production capacity is quite high, but gasoline production is still limited by transportation. There is a large stock of oil on the iron road. The processing power is limited and cannot be fully utilized. In terms of quality, there has been significant progress. The辛數 has been increased to 25 degrees, and the driving efficiency is much higher than that of alcohol, while the price is lower than alcohol. According to statistics, 2 million gallons of gasoline can be produced within half a year. As for the Usu Oilfield in Xinjiang, production is also being actively carried out.</p>
<h3>Sino-US Cooperation, Dongcheng Establishes Automobile Factory</h3>
<p>Dongcheng Enterprise Company in this city plans to establish an automobile manufacturing factory. The technical part will be undertaken by experts selected by a major American automobile manufacturer. This plan is currently under discussion with the United States. In addition to the engineering technology being fully responsible by the American side, the funds and management will still be managed by the company. If there are no special events, the manufacturing factory is expected to be established this year. It is heard that it is estimated that 15 cars can be produced per day when the factory opens.</p>
<h3>Local Banks Are Not Allowed to Establish Branches in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Regarding the prohibition of provincial banks or local banks from establishing branches or offices in Nanjing and Shanghai, it is heard that in fact, there is no need for provincial local banks to establish in Shanghai. For the sake of the future of the financial business of each province, the local banks of each province should seek development in this province. Therefore, the Shanghai branch of Zhejiang Local Bank has closed in compliance with the order. As for Jiangsu Bank and Jiangsu Farmers' Bank, because Nanjing and Shanghai originally belonged to Jiangsu, they can be established in Nanjing and Shanghai. It is heard that all provincial local banks that have opened in Nanjing and Shanghai have been ordered to close or changed to liaison offices. However, the Shanghai branch of Bank of Taiwan was specially approved by the Ministry of Finance to be established.</p>
<h3>Cotton Fabric Market Situation Improved</h3>
<p>Due to purchases of serge, bleached cloth, and Tibetan broadcloth from Fujian, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Hubei provinces, Tianjin merchants have recently seen strong demand for grey cloth. They are particularly keen on acquiring 12-pound Three-A Color Ball cloth, followed by 12-pound Five Blessings Blue Chicken cloth. Fine cloth sales are also considerable, which has led to an increasingly robust grey cloth market. According to market sources, there is strong demand for military uniforms, and large companies have placed substantial orders for grey cloth. Today, the China Textile Company listed only three types of 12-pound fine cloth: Blue Chicken, Blue V-Character, and Red V-Character. Dragon Head Color Ball and Yang He brands were not listed, and the quantity allocated for purchase has generally been reduced. Twelve-pound Blue Chicken cloth is allocated at half the quantity specified on the deposit slip. Only registration numbers 120 to 170 for Touma Bleached Cloth are available; the rest are not allocated. Consequently, the market continued to rise in the afternoon, as the supply from the Textile Construction Company was scarce, pushing grey cloth prices even higher.</p>
<h3>British Bristles Insufficient for Demand; Supply Department Reduces Usage; Tianjin Export Goods Slightly Move</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The British Brush Manufacturers' Association recently held its annual meeting, where the supply of pig bristles was discussed. The Association stated that its members felt the Supply Department's recent reduction in the amount of bristles allocated to brush manufacturers was excessively severe. Last year, the Supply Department had hoped to airlift a batch of high-quality bristles stored in Chongqing to India, but this was not possible due to the suspension of air transport at the time. Currently, the Department is hesitant to transport the bristles via ship to the lower Yangtze River due to safety concerns, and no decision has been reached.</p>
<p>The Association unanimously passed a motion urging the Supply Department to publish the total stock of bristles to obtain valuable information on pricing and other related issues. An advisory committee has now been established to maintain close communication with the Supply Department. It is also reported that the Department sold South American bristles at a price of one pound and five-eighths for use in making shoe brushes and stove brushes, but the Bristle Identification Committee did not consider this significant.</p>
<p>[Tianjin News] Exports of fur and pig bristles from this city were very active in April, with most being shipped to the United States, and some to the United Kingdom, Australia, and Hong Kong. However, some of these goods did not meet the required standards, leading the New York Brush Manufacturers Association to send a letter to the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce specifying the required sizes. Subsequent shipments have adhered to these standards, making the outlook more optimistic. According to the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau, the export statistics for April are as follows: Furs: a total of 392 bales and 204 boxes, valued at $1,070,156.107; Bristles: a total of 707 boxes, with 658 boxes failing to meet standards, 303.041 metric tons, with 32.783 metric tons failing to meet standards, valued at $4,050,960.856.</p>
<h3>Hunan and Guangdong Procure Rice in Jiangxi; Chairman Orders Ban on Hoarding</h3>
<p>[Nanchang Dispatch] Last year, the Central Government stipulated the purchase of 2 million dan of surplus grain in Jiangxi to be transported to the lower Yangtze River. However, due to the devastation of the rural areas after eight years of war and a sharp decline in production, there is a fear that local grain will be impacted. The procurement price is far below the market price, so the purchase in each county has not been fulfilled. It was later approved to reduce the amount to 500,000 dan, to be delivered by the end of May. Chairman Wang recently went to Nanjing, where Chairman Chiang emphasized the importance of supplying the troops and prisoners of war, and instructed him to ensure the amount was delivered on time. Wang returned to the province from Lushan on the 16th and attached great importance to this matter. In addition to ordering the more than forty counties responsible for the procurement, such as Fengcheng, to ensure the quantity was purchased on time, he will also strengthen the transportation organization to concentrate the delivery in Jiujiang. It is reported that 170,000 dan have been purchased so far. The remaining amount is difficult to procure as the grain prices in various parts of the province are between $5,000 and $9,000, and it is currently the peak of the spring famine. It is rumored that the Central Government, to alleviate the suffering of the people, intends to increase the procurement price.</p>
<p>The neighboring provinces of Hunan and Guangdong are also facing severe grain shortages. The Jiangxi Provincial Land and Grain Bureau was ordered to allocate 200,000 dan of rice to Hunan and 100,000 dan to Guangdong. It is reported that the Provincial Bureau has designated the purchase of 100,000 dan in counties such as Dexing, Lianhua, and Anfu for Hunan, and 50,000 dan in areas such as Lichuan for Guangdong, to provide relief.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Chairman Chiang has personally ordered all party branches and senates in the southeastern provinces not to prohibit grain exports or obstruct the flow of grain under the pretext of insufficient food supply, so that areas with surplus grain can help those in need. (May 16th)</p>
<h3>Business Registration Fees Reduced to 1/2000th</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Since the implementation of industrial and commercial registration in this city, the high registration fees have been met with complaints from the local business community, who have repeatedly appealed through letters and telegrams. It has been learned that the Social Affairs Bureau, in response to public opinion, has drafted an alternative plan and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval. In accordance with the new Company Law, the registration fee will be set at 1/2000th of the capital, and will be announced and implemented soon.</p>
<h3>After Three Days of Declines, the Rice Market Rebounded Yesterday; Coarse Grains and Oil Cakes Follow Suit</h3>
<p>After several days of sharp declines in the rice market, merchants took advantage of the situation to stock up, and public sentiment improved. Indica rice rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and Xian rice also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Flour also rose by 400 to 500 yuan. Soybeans also edged higher, increasing by 500 to 600 yuan. Bean cakes followed suit, rising by 200 to 300 yuan, and bran slightly increased by 100 to 200 yuan. Qingdao corn has become more popular and also rose by 1,000 yuan. The oil market has various sources of supply, but sales are sluggish, causing prices to increase by 1,000 yuan. All grains are following the rice price trend. According to rice market sources, a total of over 5,000 shih of rice arrived in the city yesterday. The types and quantities are as follows: White Geng 2,451 shih, Thin Rice 847 shih, Early Rice 718 shih, Yang Xian 233 shih, Du Xian 512 shih, Wu Xian 38 shih, and White Yuan 300 shih.</p>
<p>Wu Chang Rice Shop's Price Hike Investigated by the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Since the Municipal Government took emergency measures to strictly prohibit speculation and manipulation, and investigated rice inventories in various warehouses, speculators have disappeared and stockpiled rice is gradually being released. The rice price has steadily returned to normal in recent days. When the market opened yesterday, it was calm and stable. At a price of $48,500, someone offered to sell over one hundred bags (Du Xian Ying Bag). Unexpectedly, Wu Chang Rice Shop deliberately raised the price of early thin rice to $55,000, and the market atmosphere immediately became tense. Most sellers held back, citing rising production costs and competing to raise prices, resulting in an increase of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The authorities were enraged upon hearing of this, and it was reported that the shop had raised prices to profiteer on more than ten occasions. The high prices seen in the rice market last week were all caused by the shop's actions, clearly demonstrating manipulative speculation and disrupting the rice market. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately dispatched a special investigator to the shop to review its accounting books, shareholder names, rice inventory, and transaction quantities for investigation. At the same time, the shop's manager, Rong Yongming, was summoned to the Bureau for questioning. If the above-mentioned misconduct is confirmed, he will be severely punished to serve as a warning to others.</p>
<p>Today is the Last Day for Business Registration for Rice and Grain Merchants</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] To understand the rice and grain registration situation, the reporter visited the Bean and Rice Merchants Association and Rice Shop Association yesterday. It was learned that about 120 rice shops belonging to the Bean and Rice Merchants Association, holding rice in storage, have completed registration, with a total registered inventory of 35,900 shih. Over 1,000 rice shops belonging to the Rice Shop Association have completed registration, with an average inventory of about 50 shih per shop, totaling no more than 100,000 shih. In addition, the registered inventory for dealers is approximately 40,000 shih. Today is the last day for registration, and it is hoped that rice shops in the suburban areas will promptly register according to the situation, so that the associations can report the total registered amount to the Social Affairs Bureau tomorrow. According to general observations, the total registered rice inventory in the city is approximately 300,000 shih.</p>
<p>It is reported that the total amount of foreign rice recently ordered by the China Grain Corporation is 213,000 tons. It is rumored that a portion will be allocated to various rice shops and merchants for sale, in order to make it widely available on the market. The first batch of 6,000 tons of Annam rice is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early June. The Grain Administration Bureau explained that the rice merchants in the city have been greatly weakened by enemy and puppet exploitation over the years, and their purchasing power is much lower than before the war. In terms of current transportation capacity, they can barely supply the consumption needs of the Shanghai market. However, if citizens rush to buy and stockpile, the rice merchants will not be able to cope. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will remain calm and stable during this lean period. When the foreign rice arrives in a steady stream, the food supply situation will surely improve.</p>

<h3>Losses of World War II: Most Accurate Statistics; Fatality Rate: Soviet Union Heaviest; China Ranks Fifth</h3>
<p>— Special Article by This Newspaper Translation Office</p>
<p>The more advanced humanity becomes, the more proficient it is in mutual slaughter. During World War II, the warring nations engaged in fierce competition, and new types of killing weapons emerged one after another, causing unprecedented catastrophe in human history. Soldiers who died on the battlefield, civilians killed or injured in bombings, innocent people massacred by bandits, patriotic men and women persecuted by the enemy, and those displaced, starving, and impoverished... Whether in the East or West, in large or small countries, they all encountered the same fate. Wherever the flames of war spread, homes were reduced to ruins, corpses littered the fields, blood flowed in rivers, and the loss of life, property, manpower, and material resources was countless. This is truly a great loss for humanity.</p>
<h3>Total Population Loss Exceeds 50 Million</h3>
<p>According to statistics published in the "1946 World Almanac" recently published by the American "New York World-Telegram," the total number of soldiers and civilians killed, injured, missing, and captured in World War II exceeded 50 million. These figures were compiled based on government communiqués, intelligence bureau records, quasi-official publications, wartime relief organizations, and newspaper accounts. The actual number of deaths is likely to be higher, as many went unrecorded. The number of deaths, missing, and captured in each country is listed in "Table 1."</p>
<p>We can see from "Table 1" that the Soviet Union suffered the most casualties. The number of people who died in the war against Germany is estimated at between 12 million and 15 million, with soldiers and civilians accounting for half each. The number listed in the table is the median. The second most affected country is Poland, with a total of 10,045,000 people, of whom 1,045,000 were soldiers and 9 million were civilians, including 5 million people (3 million of whom were Jewish) who were killed during the occupation. The third most affected country is Germany, with 9.9 million people. From this, we can imagine the devastation of the German-Soviet war, especially the inhuman brutality of the Germans under Hitler.</p>
<p>The fourth-highest fatality rate was Japan, with a total of 5,086,278 military casualties, not including civilians. Due to lack of medicine and malnutrition in the Japanese army, many soldiers suffered from diseases, totaling over 4.47 million, of whom at least 40,000 died from illness. According to a communiqué issued by the Tokyo authorities on August 23, 1945, 44 Japanese cities were almost completely destroyed, with a total of 10 million civilians killed, injured, and homeless. Among them, 260,000 people died, including 90,000 in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The number of injured was 412,000, including 180,000 injured in the atomic bombings. The total number of destroyed houses was 2.21 million, the number of partially destroyed houses was 90,000, and the number of homeless people was 9.2 million.</p>
<p>China ranks fifth in terms of fatality rate. According to a report by General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, on September 28, 1945, more than 1.8 million officers and soldiers died in China's eight-year war of resistance, with an additional 1.7 million injured and missing.</p>
<h3>Total Ship Losses Exceed 4,700 Vessels</h3>
<p>According to figures released by the U.S. Navy and the British Admiralty on June 13, 1945, the total number of ships lost by the Allies and neutral countries in World War II was 4,770, with a total tonnage of 21,140,000 tons. The United States directly lost 570 ships in naval warfare and 984 ships due to accidents at sea. The number of U.S. merchant mariners killed, missing, and captured was 6,066. During the period from September 3, 1939, to May 8, 1945, the United Kingdom lost 2,570 ships (totaling 11,380,000 tons), the United States lost 538 ships (totaling 3,310,000 tons), other Allied nations lost 1,172 ships (totaling 5,030,000 tons), and neutral countries lost 490 ships (totaling 1,420,000 tons).</p>
<p>The ships lost by Finland, Hungary, Italy, and Japan are included in the total number of neutral countries before those countries entered into conflict with Britain and the United States, but ships controlled by enemy countries after the outbreak of war are not included. The actual number of losses is higher than this, as the ships seized by Germany in occupied countries are not included, nor are auxiliary ships currently serving in the army or navy.</p>
<p>The statistics of ship losses of the Allied and neutral countries published by the U.S. Navy and the British Admiralty are listed in "Table 2."</p>
<p>According to another statistic, the United States lost a total of 696 ships in World War II, the United Kingdom lost 730 ships, the British Dominions lost 46 ships, and Japan lost 684 ships. At the end of the war, Japan still had 533 warships. According to a joint British-American report issued on June 10, 1945, the Allies destroyed a total of 713 German submarines in the Atlantic campaign.</p>
<p>The total tonnage of merchant ships lost by Japan in World War II was 6.13 million tons, as listed in "Table 3."</p>
<p>(Table 3: Statistics of Merchant Ships Lost by Japan)</p>
<h3>British and American Bombs Dropped Totaled 2.7 Million Tons</h3>
<p>The actual situation of air force activities and losses of the United States and Britain in World War II is listed in "Table 4."</p>
<p>According to a report by the U.S. Air Force, a total of 502,781 tons of bombs were dropped in the Pacific War, destroying 7,362 enemy aircraft and losing 4,530 aircraft.</p>
<p>According to a statement made by a Japanese government spokesman on September 5, 1945, Japan lost 51,109 aircraft in the Pacific War. The Japanese Army built a total of 32,500 aircraft and lost 25,500 in the war. The Japanese Navy built a total of 30,295 aircraft and lost 25,609 in the war. In other words, Japan lost 51,109 of its 62,795 aircraft.</p>

<h3>Changchun, the 29th Day</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>While the debate on whether to break through was undecided, a unit of the Communist army had already crept in from the northwest of the Central Bank. Using the undulating terrain, they charged in through the back door. This was at 5 PM. The defending troops' positions had shifted to the rear entrance of the Central Bank. Machine guns fired outwards, the sound seeming to be just outside the door. Deputy Commander Liu Depu led over a hundred men in a charge, annihilating the approaching Communist soldiers. Only the sound of gunfire grew more distant. Due to Liu Depu's successful attack, the final decision to break out was made.</p>
<p>However, the battle continued. At this time, near Dongtuo, a company of Communist soldiers surrendered with their guns raised, because they had run out of ammunition. They reported and asked how to handle the situation. It was later unknown how it was handled.</p>
<p>The breakout began, but the Communist army had sealed it off with a wall of fire. The first few to rush out all fell to the ground. Shenzhi entered the next lower level of the vault, anticipating that the possibility of a breakout was already very small. He actually witnessed the final moments of this tragic disaster.</p>
<p>A portion opened the main gate and went out, but the main gate was a revolving door, extremely narrow. So they smashed the glass and jumped out one by one. A line formed behind, filling the business department to capacity. It took a long time; how could four or five hundred people run out all at once?</p>
<p>Chen Jiazhen and Wang Ninghua, the acting chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government, as well as many civil servants, all went out through the east side door. Shenzhi sat in the vault and slept, confident in his safety. Also there were three employees of the China Changchun Railway (CCR), who had come to the Central Bank yesterday on business, and could only hide here, awaiting being taken as "prisoners," constantly lamenting their bad luck.</p>
<p>Six Searches for "Prisoners"</p>
<p>The four people sat in the middle of the vault's corridor, hearing the sound of gunfire gradually diminish outside. At around 9 o'clock, a flurry of footsteps rushed into the vault. The road to the vault was a very winding one, making it easy to get lost. A CCR employee stepped forward to greet them, seeing that it was indeed Communist soldiers, fierce and with oily faces. He saw that all four were in plain clothes and asked, "Where are you from?" They replied that they were employees of the CCR company. Thereupon, he felt them all over, checking for weapons. This was the first search.</p>
<p>Several Communist soldiers thought they were prisoners and told Shenzhi and the others to follow them. Naturally, they had no choice but to follow, because they had guns, and their logic was stronger than yours.</p>
<p>Before leaving, they checked again, but a different soldier this time, to see if they had any weapons. This was the second time.</p>
<p>Stepping out the door, all that could be seen was the city hall engulfed in flames, fire tongues licking the sky, dead bodies strewn on the ground. There was no time to pay close attention. The hundred or so security team members who had been captured by the Communist soldiers were already lined up, and we were told to stand with them, and then start walking. The sound of guns and cannons in the suburbs was still dense, possibly from a portion that had broken through. The four people followed and ran, gathering in the open space behind the police station, unsure of what was going on. After waiting for a while, a Communist soldier, handgun in hand, ran over and said: "Take out your watches."</p>
<p>Shenzhi tried to reason with him, but it was no use. The Communist soldier said: "You are already prisoners, don't you know?" What if they didn't know? The gun was already pointed at his chest. Anyway, it was pulled off his wrist. This was the third search.</p>
<p>The next item on the agenda was walking again. Passing through Baishan Park, through iron netting, the obstacles of corpses and sandbags, to Tongzhi Road, then turning onto Xingren Street, stopping on the road at the Mantan Gate. A large group of people was already sitting on the road at the Mantan Gate, all in plain clothes. Under the moonlight, they all looked disheveled and swollen-faced, surrounded by bayonets on all sides. The four people were separated from the security team again, also surrounded by bayonets on all sides. An Anhui-accented character was hoarsely addressing the large group of people sitting down: "...The Kuomintang is not guilty for losing the Northeast, but you four hundred Northeast compatriots are guilty?" It turned out that those sitting on the ground listening to the lecture were criminals released from prison. The Anhui-accented voice continued: "Zhao Junmai lost Hengyang, but the Kuomintang didn't punish him. He's not guilty. Now he's been sent to Changchun as mayor. Do you agree or disagree? Now you're liberated. Those who want to go home can go home. Those who want to stay here and work can stay here."</p>
<p>This gentleman rambled from the September 18th Incident all the way to the elected government, for a full hour and a half. These criminals, guarded by bayonets, applauded wildly, naturally signifying their agreement and admiration. Who would clap if they didn't admire him?</p>
<p>A separate, more distant group was being lectured to as prisoners. Only applause could be heard, but what brilliant ideas were being said was unknown. The moon rose in the south, large and round. Although it was April, the evening wind was still cold and biting. All four had lost their watches. They didn't know the time, but it was probably midnight.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the four were told to follow again. At this time, prisoners and criminals were mixed together, rushed into the Red Swastika Society next to the Mantan Building. In the crowd, Shenzhi was searched for weapons again by a Communist soldier. This time, the camera was taken away. He said: "It's not convenient to keep this thing on you." This was the fourth search.</p>
<p>Five or six hundred people surged in, all going upstairs, extremely chaotic. A Communist soldier shouted an order for everyone to rest. Shenzhi and the others dragged a few chairs over and sat down to doze off. Everyone was extremely tired and fell asleep as soon as they sat down. Halfway through his sleep, he was awakened by a Communist soldier, saying there was something to do. Opening his eyes, he saw the floor, tables, and window sills were covered with sleeping people, like maggots, barely any room to put his foot. The four managed to struggle to the stairs, one by one being led into rooms to be checked. They asked for their names. The three CCR employees each took out their service certificates, respectfully presenting them to the "People's Army." The photos matched, completely accurate, but they were still searched, turning over all the pockets. The items the three friends lost were generally the same: pens, money, knives, nail clippers, shirts, shorts, etc. In this battle, Shenzhi had a pen, a shirt, shorts, two pairs of socks, a razor, and 5,000 yuan in circulation notes taken from his pockets. At this point, Shenzhi became democratic with the "People's Army," expressing his opinion, saying:</p>
<p>"I heard that your Eighth Route Army doesn't take money, is that right?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I won't take yours. Take it back."</p>
<p>But after the search was completed, as they walked out the door, a Communist soldier came up from behind, reaching out his hand and saying:</p>
<p>"Give me the money."</p>
<p>What to do? Naturally, he gave it to him, but asked him a question: "Can you let me leave here?" He replied: "We'll see." The hand of democracy was raised upwards, but this hand was reaching downwards. He was from the Eighth Route Army. Shenzhi did not say that he was a reporter for the Central Daily News, only that he was a reporter for Shenbao, and showed them his credentials. This was the fifth search.</p>
<p>The four returned and sat on their chairs, dozing off haphazardly. Not long after, dawn was breaking. Communist soldiers came one after another, looking at the prisoners to see if there was anything they could use, mostly taking shoes and belts. As a result, many prisoners were walking barefoot, but the weather was too cold to bear, so they wrapped their leggings around their feet. This happened to Shenzhi. While he was dozing, a Communist soldier picked up his foot to examine it. Shenzhi said: "Unless you shoot me dead, you can't take it." This Communist soldier felt embarrassed and slipped away without a word. This was the sixth search.</p>
<p>Shenzhi and the others wrote a note and gave it to the Communist soldiers, asking to see their commander. They promised to pass it on, but there was no reply after five hours. At noon, the criminals and prisoners were taken away in batches. The building emptied, leaving only Shenzhi and the others. Half an hour later, the guy who took the 5,000 yuan walked over and said: "Aren't you leaving yet?" Another Communist soldier said: "Why didn't you run with the people who left just now?" The first one corrected him: "Those four are not prisoners."</p>
<p>What did this mean? The four stood up and ran, and no one stopped them. Running out of the Red Swastika Society gate, they walked west along Xingren Avenue.</p>
<p>Shenzhi did not immediately return to his residence, but walked along Tongzhi Street, circling around to the Central Bank to take a look. Only Japanese were walking freely on the road. The fire at the City Hall had not been extinguished, and smoke was still rising behind the Central Bank. There were not many Communist soldiers on the street. Shenzhi walked alone back to his residence. A Communist soldier was guarding the door, but did not stop him. After washing his face, he immediately took off his clothes and went to sleep, exhausted all over, as if he had performed a special martial arts play.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Dragon Well Tea</h3>
<p>The most expensive kind of Longjing tea is called "Mingqian" (pre-Qingming). In Hangzhou tea shops, the selling price is 3,000 yuan per ounce, 48,000 yuan per catty (pound). According to Master Wuben of Shengsou Temple at the foot of Shizi Peak on North Gao Peak in Hangzhou, the true origin of Longjing tea, this is not keeping up with the price of rice. Before the war, the price of Longjing "Mingqian" tea was sixteen yuan per catty, equivalent to two loads of rice. Currently, the price of rice in Hangzhou is 50,000 yuan, meaning the price of tea has fallen by half.</p>
<p>There is an old Longjing stele inside Shengsou Temple, carved on the pool rock. In front of the temple is a short tea grove. Master Wuben said: "This is the famous 'Eighteen Ancient Dragon Well Tea Plants,' planted during the reign of Emperor Kang of the Southern Song Dynasty." (I don't quite believe that plants from the Southern Song Dynasty could still remain after so long.) Master Wuben talked to me about tea for two hours in a small pavilion in front of the Longjing pool rock. The tea produced on the four peaks of Long, Hu, Shi, and Yun in the suburbs of Hangzhou are all called Longjing tea. Among the four peaks, Shizi Peak tea is the best. A French professor at Zhejiang University believes that the reason is that the soil of Shizi Peak contains more iron and manganese, and is white sandy soil, while the other peaks are yellow sandy soil, so they are inferior to Shizi Peak. Currently, most of the Shizi Peak tea is picked and roasted by the Shizi Peak Tea Company, invested and managed by the Bank of China. The products are mostly distributed among the bank's own colleagues, with only a small amount sold on the market. His Shengsou Temple planted a small amount. Every year before Qingming Festival, he hires Xiaoshan tea girls and tea boys to pick leaves in the mountains and roast them in the temple. He believes that the "Mingqian" tea sold on the market is impossible, because before Qingming, the tea just sprouts, the buds are tender and very moist, and cannot be processed. Generally, it is called "Jiaoqian" (before-bud), but is actually picked and processed "Minghou" (after-Qingming), and can also be called "Yuqian" (before-rain) tea.</p>
<p>This old monk has never left the Longjing tea area during the eight years of turmoil, guarding this temple, and witnessing the vicissitudes of the mountains. He said that in the eight years, there were always people picking leaves from the tea mountains every year, but no one weeded or controlled pests, so that today, tea trees and vines and insects are intertwined on both sides of the mountain paths, and the tea leaves are no longer as fresh and tender as they were eight years ago.</p>
<p>From Yunlin Temple, I passed through the Three Heavenly Sanctuaries, climbed to the Que Ridge on North Gao Peak, and down to the Longjing valley. By the time we had finished our conversation, the sun was setting in the west. Master Wuben sent a tea boy to lead me out of the mountains to the source of the Nine Creeks and Eighteen Streams. Along the way, tea-picking women wore bamboo hats and torn blue cloth shirts, and wore tea baskets like fishermen's gear around their waists. Sitting on their own small wooden stools, they picked leaves one by one in the green tea bushes. I stopped many times to inquire about their wages. They said: "Twenty yuan per ounce, three hundred and twenty yuan per catty."</p>
<p>"How many catties can you pick in a day?"</p>
<p>"We can pick four or five catties of fresh leaves in a day."</p>
<p>Most of them are from Xiaoshan County. They cross the Qiantang River north during the tea season to work as seasonal tea pickers in the mountains. Their monthly income is only thirty or forty thousand yuan. After the tea season, they still return to their homes in Xiaoshan and work as farmers. In this tea-picking work under the sun and rain, they may have their own pastoral romances, but the hard work and meager income do not inspire the tea songs in the mountains, so tourists want to hear a tea song but cannot.</p>
<p>Longjing tea from the Jiuxi tea farm, paired with creek water, tastes like bathing your feet in cold stream water. The tea seats under the reed sheds here and the female tea guests make people forget that they are in a chaotic world. My fellow traveler and I left the Jiuxi tea farm and walked on the stone road to the Qiantang River, hired a small boat and sailed downstream towards Hangzhou. On the boat, we watched the Qiantang River flow towards the East China Sea, the current calm and the surface wide, silent yet seemingly with sound. In a moment, the red-tiled buildings and green trees of Zhejiang University passed by. In a moment, the tall shadow of the Six Harmonies Pagoda passed by. In a moment, we secretly floated past the Qiantang River Railway Bridge. We landed outside the city of Hangzhou and hired a car again to enter the city via the highway and the lakeside. We saw that lotus leaves had just begun to float on the surface of the South Lake. The summer nights are soon to be fragrant on the lake. Just the lake, the lotus, and the boats are enough to attract people to the summer nights of West Lake. After our ordeal, we really want to be professional boatmen, rowing for lovers, blowing away all the dust of our travels in the evening breeze.</p>
<p>However, according to the boatman, a white wooden boat currently costs 200,000 yuan to build. If it is fully equipped, with various facilities such as sofa cushions and awnings, it costs 450,000 yuan. We are, after all, a cog in the current social arrangement. This lakeside life is destined not to be our fate. We are afraid we won't have the opportunity to visit West Lake in the hot summer, so let's take a few deep breaths of the fresh air on the lake at night.</p>
<p>In our last lake tour, the boatman said again that the reason why West Lake is always beautiful and always fresh is because its perpetual flow of spring water from the high mountains on the north, south, and west sides flows into the Qiantang River through a hidden sluice gate on the east side. During the day, the tour boats disturb the water quality, but at night, fresh spring water flows east to the lake, and the turbid and polluted lake water secretly flows into the river. In the morning, the water on the lake is as fresh as new again. Therefore, the residents by the lake store water in wooden buckets early in the morning for drinking throughout the day. The people of Hangzhou are happy. The water quality is good, and the lake and mountains are beautiful, making them infinitely admired.</p>

<h3>Ideal New Enterprise Experimental Demonstration Zone: Yunnan Sericulture New Village</h3>
<p>— Kunming, 17th Dispatch, Bo Ying</p>
<p>On April 16th, I took the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway express train from Kunming to Kaiyuan. The train departed at 7:00 AM and arrived at 6:00 PM. I spent the entire day cooped up in the carriage, feeling extremely tired. Fortunately, I had a classmate, Mr. Yang, traveling with me, and we chatted and laughed to pass the long hours. Mr. Yang is specializing in sericulture, and this time he is going to the Caoba Sericulture New Village for an internship. As for me, I am there for sightseeing, focusing on investigating the organization and general overview of the new village. Although our purposes are different, our interests are the same. The next day, we were delayed in Kaiyuan due to rain. On the 18th, we took the train south from Kaiyuan again, and got off at the station before Bisezhai, and arrived at Caoba. (In the Yunnan dialect, a plateau surrounded by mountains is called a "ba").</p>
<p>Caoba is located in the Mengzi County of Yunnan, close to Kaiyuan County. It is a flat area surrounded by mountains on all sides, with a total area of approximately 85,000 mu. The Yunnan Sericulture New Village is located there. Before the establishment of the Kaimeng Reclamation Bureau by the Yunnan Provincial Government, Caoba suffered from neglected water conservancy, barren land, sparse population, and a generally desolate appearance. After the Kaimeng Reclamation Bureau was established, it began to gradually buy back all land rights at market prices. Within two years, ditches were dredged, fields were divided, and the atmosphere was completely renewed.</p>
<p>Establishing a Sericulture New Village Creates a Demonstrative Effect</p>
<p>The Yunnan Sericulture New Village was established in the 28th year of the Republic (1939), occupying 10,000 mu of land, leased from the Reclamation Bureau for a long term. The establishment of the Sericulture New Village is an experiment of an ideal new enterprise. The purpose is to build a model new rural area, as preparation for the transformation of our country's rural areas and the improvement of our country's agriculture. The experimental scientific spirit and demonstrative nature of the founders will undoubtedly have merit and value for the future of our country's agriculture.</p>
<p>In April of the 28th year of the Republic, after the establishment meeting of the Yunnan Sericulture New Village Co., Ltd. was held in Kunming, this Yunnan Sericulture New Village was conceived. Originally, the name of the company, the words "Sericulture" indicated the scope, and the words "New Village" indicated the system. Although the company was established in accordance with the Limited Company Organization Law, the shareholders who make up this company are not individuals, but banks affiliated with the central and local governments. The initial total capital was 10 million national currency, which increased to 25 million in the 30th year (1941), and remains so to this day. The industrial magnate Mr. Miao Yuntai serves as the chairman of the company, and the agricultural expert Mr. Ge Jingzhong serves as the general manager.</p>
<p>The New Village Occupies Ten Thousand Mu of Green Mulberry Trees Stretching Endlessly</p>
<p>Regarding the organization of the company, under the general manager, there is a chief technician responsible for technical aspects, and the following departments are also established: General Affairs Department, overseeing all affairs; Finance Department, managing the company's income and expenditure; Mulberry Affairs Department, responsible for mulberry planting; Sericulture Affairs Department, responsible for silkworm rearing; Silk Affairs Department, responsible for reeling silk; Education Department, jointly operated with the Reclamation Bureau, responsible for educating farmers' children. There are also a silk factory and an alcohol factory. In addition to refining alcohol, the alcohol factory also uses mulberries to produce juice. In recent years, Mulberry Wine, which is popular in Kunming and enjoyed by the Allied forces, is mostly supplied from here. In addition, there is also an office and a cold storage facility in Kunming.</p>
<p>The new village occupies approximately 10,000 mu, of which more than 7,000 mu are mulberry orchards. Because the initial plan was very ambitious, preparing to gradually expand and include the entire Caoba area within the scope of the new village, many facilities are comprehensive. The new village has two major roads in a cross shape, each seven meters wide. From east to west, it connects Caoba Station and reaches the foot of West Mountain. From south to north, it reaches the foot of North Mountain from the foot of South Mountain. When I got off the train at Caoba Station and strolled along the east-west main road, I saw green mulberry trees on both sides, stretching across fields and ridges. Looking ahead, the main road paved with gravel stretched straight west, endlessly. My heart was refreshed.</p>
<p>The Eastern Section of the East-West Main Road is Designated as the New Village Area</p>
<p>The southern end of Caoba Station, next to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, is designated as an industrial zone, where the silk factory and alcohol factory are located. On the Caoba early-stage side of the east-west main road is the Sixteenth Village. According to the company's original plan, many small villages would be established, each with fifty "lian" (units), and each "lian" with two unit village houses. Each unit village house would have two rooms with a depth of 7.25 meters and a width of 4.50 meters for work, and two rooms with a depth of 4.25 meters and a width of 3.35 meters for living, plus a kitchen and a toilet. The distance between each "lian" is 15 meters from front to back, and 6 meters from left to right. However, just after the Sixteenth and Thirteenth Villages were built, Vietnam fell into enemy hands, and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was interrupted, the source of materials was lacking, and the construction project came to a standstill. Later, the Reclamation Bureau used skilled craftsmen (initially, all the carpenters, masons, bamboo workers, and stone workers in the new village were hired from the lower Yangtze River region, numbering thousands) to build many small villages using local materials, such as the First Village, Second Village, Fifth Village, Sixth Village, Seventeenth Village, and Nineteenth Village, and Twentieth Village, etc., which are now distributed in Caoba, for tenants who cultivate the land of the Bureau. Walking west along this main road from the Sixteenth Village for twenty minutes, one reaches the Thirteenth Village. A reception center and a hospital are located between the two villages. Further west to the intersection of the cross-shaped main road, this place was originally planned to be the ideal center of the new village, the central hub of the entire village, but it did not materialize. Strictly speaking, the current scope of the new village is limited to the eastern section of the east-west main road.</p>
<p>The Main Business is Divided into Three Items: Mulberry Planting, Silkworm Rearing, and Silk Reeling</p>
<p>The Sericulture New Village, as its name suggests, is mainly engaged in sericulture. Sericulture includes three items: mulberry planting, silkworm rearing, and silk reeling. Mulberry planting and silk reeling are handled by the Sericulture Company. Because large-scale mulberry planting, managed in a unified way, is easier to obtain uniform and good mulberry leaves. As for silk reeling, because it is necessary to produce uniform and high-grade raw silk, good machinery and equipment are needed, and a good market must be sought, so the company must have this right and obligation during its business period. Therefore, only the second item, silkworm rearing, is the true main business of the villagers. Villagers are recruited from nearby farmers and people from outside, and the company provides them with considerable technical training. These people are called "village friends" here. The company provides village friends with housing, silkworm seeds, silkworm rooms, and silkworm tools. In order to take care of the economic situation of ordinary farmers, a method of pre-paying cocoon money is also provided for relief. Because we know that the usual cost of silkworm cocoons includes: silkworm seeds, mulberry leaves, silkworm rooms, silkworm tools, labor, and food. In addition to the first four items provided by the company, labor, food, and other expenses still require cash expenditure. The so-called "pre-paying cocoon money" method is to estimate the number of cocoons you will receive in the future based on the number of silkworm eggs you initially raised, and then convert it into a market price. After deducting the cost of silkworm seeds, mulberry leaves, etc., the company can allow you to use it in advance in installments, without having to wait until the time of handing over the cocoons.</p>
<p>The Prosperous Period Has Passed, and the New Village Scene is Desolate</p>
<p>Normally, rearing one "liang" (a unit of weight) of silkworm eggs can produce two "dan" (another unit of weight) of cocoons. During the heyday of the new village, about 900 "dan" of cocoons could be produced each season. There are two seasons a year, spring and autumn, so 1,800 "dan" could be harvested. Caoba was quite prosperous at that time. However, later, inflation deteriorated daily, the production business trended downward, and the government promoted a policy of unified purchase and sale. Silk was also included in the unified purchase and sale, so costs rose daily, but prices could not be raised, and silk production fell into a desperate situation. The prosperity of the new village was no longer seen. After August of last year, the national economy was depressed, which came along with the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. In late September, it was necessary to tighten the belt again. Although this was called tightening, it was actually an ending. All departments, except for a very small number of people left behind for aftercare, were all laid off. Therefore, when I arrived at Caoba this time, the scene was quite desolate. After the company closed last year, the houses were occupied by the military and all were damaged. The silk factory and alcohol factory were also silent, frighteningly desolate. Now only the Thirteenth Village is still raising silkworms. This is what was restored this spring, because after Mr. Ge Jingzhong went to Shanghai, he saw that the sericulture industry in the Jiangzhe area was almost completely destroyed during the Anti-Japanese War. This year, Jiangzhe can produce at most 400,000 sheets of silkworm seeds, while the national demand is 1.2 million sheets. Except for a portion that can be imported from Japan, it is still insufficient. Therefore, he advocated the restoration of the Sericulture New Village, but to ensure that it would not lose money, the scope of work was limited to seed production. It is now estimated that 180,000 sheets of seeds can be produced this season (spring), and roughly the same number can be produced in the autumn, so Caoba can produce about 350,000 sheets of silkworm seeds this year.</p>
<p>Yunnan's Dry Climate is Suitable for Silkworm Seed Production</p>
<p>We look forward to the future of our country's sericulture industry with optimism, because the following three reasons create our optimistic factors: (1) The recovery of foreign markets, especially the large demand from the United States. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from New York on May 12, the United States needs our special products, and silk is among them. (2) Due to the recovery of the occupied areas, the area using silk is expanding accordingly. (3) The abolition of the government's unified purchase and sale policy. Naturally, there are difficulties, such as: (1) The devastating destruction of the sericulture industry in the occupied areas. The Taihu area, the largest sericulture area in our country, has been destroyed by more than 70 percent. Other areas, such as Guangdong, Shandong, and the Northeast, have also been severely damaged. It will take more than three to five years to restore them. (2) Competition from Japan. The foundation of the Japanese sericulture industry is better than ours, so recovery is easier. Moreover, since Japan's defeat in the war, heavy industry is under the control of the Allied powers and cannot be revived. They can only seek development in light industries such as silk. (3) The widespread application of the American industrial product, Nylon. However, these difficulties can be overcome by human effort. Of course, this depends on the efforts of sericulture professionals and the formulation of good sericulture policies by the government. As for Yunnan sericulture, although it is inferior to Jiangzhe and Guangdong, Yunnan's climate is high and dry, especially suitable for seed production. If efforts can be made in this area, there will be promising opportunities. Finally, I would like to thank Professor Hu Hongjun, a sericulture expert currently in charge of seed production in Caoba, because his detailed instructions enabled me to successfully complete this dispatch.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on the Forms of Comedy</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Recently, some people have been shouting: We need to express deep sorrow, and we need more to gain the power of life in hearty laughter. On the other side of tragedy, comedy is even more needed. Comedy is the art of providing people with materials for "laughter." However, the "laughter" referred to by the ancients should be full of artistic atmosphere, hidden deep in people's souls, enough to evoke humanity's highest and ideal life, and give humanity the highest spiritual comfort. It is not laughter caused by low-level interests or laughter caused by vulgar ideas.</p>
<p>Comedy, just like tragedy, has its social significance. Of course, it also analyzes the truth of society for people to see, writing about good people and ugly people, praising the greatness of life's ideals and exposing the darkness of society, with warmth and coldness. It reveals the darkness behind the sunshine, and the lewdness behind the solemnity. In fact, according to Galsworthy, tragedy and comedy do not have absolute and distinct differences, and cannot even be distinguished literally. Indeed, tragedy permeates the element of sorrow, expressing the hardships and sorrows of the world, making the audience also feel a deep sorrow. Comedy, on the other hand, treats certain shortcomings in individuals or society with an attitude of joking and scolding, allowing the audience to feel an inner laugh. But you cannot say that there is no sorrow in comedy. Moreover, some great comedies, such as Gogol's "The Inspector General," from the severe and penetrating satire, will make people feel a sense of unspeakable and unlaughable distress.</p>
<p>From the history of Western literature, we can trace the characteristics of comedy. In the entire development of comedy, there are various forms. Roughly, the kind of comedy in Rome that is based on tricks or romance belongs to one category, and the kind of comedy in the Elizabethan era that has romanticism color and spirit is another category. Contemporary with the romantic comedy full of fantasy, there is another kind of satirical realistic comedy. Molière's comedy of manners in France also emerged at the same time. In addition, the comedy of wit in the English Restoration era is another form, and the sentimental comedy from the eighteenth century to the beginning of the nineteenth century should belong to another category.</p>
<p>In the modern era, comedy does not seem to have produced new material. It can also be said that modern comedy has not created forms that transcend the past. The characteristics and effects of ancient comedy exist separately in modern comedy. As the drama theorist Zhang Min said: "Many comedies have the old form in their essence, but have changed slightly due to the special conditions of the modern stage and society. Some comedies are mixed with two or more old forms." Therefore, to understand the characteristics of modern comedy, we must recognize the various forms of ancient comedy.</p>
<p>Greene's "Haysm Hallway" and Crothers's "The Held Island" are like typical characters, set off in ridiculous dialogues, and do not have exaggerated characteristics like "farces." This is a representative of Roman comedy based on situations or tricks. In John Millington Synge's "The Playboy of the Western World" and George Bernard Shaw's "The Doctor's Dilemma," the foolishness of people in society at that time is revealed and satirized. To put it mildly, it is very similar to the satirical realistic works written by comedians like Jonson in the Elizabethan era. The characteristics of the romantic comedy of the Elizabethan era can sometimes be found in the works of Barker and Housman. As for the spirit of Shakespeare's romantic comedy, it is fully expressed in modern musical comedy.</p>
<p>Molière's comedy in France is a school of its own. It is based on the conflict of various opposing ideas of people, expressing the relationship between people and people, and people and society, with a humorous but serious attitude. This is called the comedy of manners, and it is the most perfect and highest form of comedy. It is much more difficult to write successful works of this kind than other types of comedy, because it is not easy to handle characters, especially the characters' personalities. Pinero's "The Second Mrs. Tanqueray," Berman's "The Second Man," and Shaw's "Candida" are known to belong to the comedy of manners.</p>
<p>In addition, speaking of comedies that are based on wit and humor, and reveal fun from dialogues, they seem to be rare in modern times, although they occupy a very important position in the characteristics of various modern comedies. Oscar Wilde's "Lady Windermere's Fan" and Maugham's "The Circle" can be said to be successful works of humorous comedy.</p>
<p>The least noticeable is the sentimental comedy of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century. It is still a question whether this type of comedy has its artistic value. According to modern comedians, sentimental comedy cannot be regarded as a success, because it tries its best to eliminate an atmosphere of X, which is recognized as the main characteristic of comedy. At the same time, modern comedies are mostly permeated with the elements of fantasy, while sentimental comedies do not focus on fantasy, and even exclude fantasy. In modern times, Barre is relatively close to sentimental comedy. Analyzing his works, the sentimental elements are indeed dominant.</p>
<p>The past forms of comedy have had a great influence on modern comedians. Some writers grasp one past form of comedy, and some writers combine two past forms of comedy. Kelly's "The Torch-Bearers" mixes the characteristics of Roman comedy and English Restoration comedy. Some people say that modern comedy imitates old forms of the past and fails to create new things. This statement is incorrect. Originally, the development of comedy also has a certain inevitable trend in the invisible. After historical evolution, it has reached the peak of its development in modern times. We naturally cannot hope that new forms will be created, because the basic characteristics of comedy limit it. The existence of past comedy forms in modern comedy can only be said to be an inevitable result, and cannot be said to be purely imitation.</p>
<p>In short, modern comedy is formed by grasping the various comedic characteristics provided by past comedians, through the conditions of modern society and the stage. Modern comedy can also be said to be the highest and most perfect stage in the entire development of comedy. Modern comedians have adopted the theories and practices of past comedy to expand the artistic value of modern comedy and promote the artistic function of modern comedy, making it form a most perfect form of comedy.</p>
<h3>Life and Art</h3>
<p>— Song Shouchang</p>
<p>People often misunderstand the two words "life," thinking that life is simply survival. However, according to the meanings of both, survival is merely one of the conditions of life, but not the entirety of it. What is called life can be divided into two aspects: (1) Survival – the material life; (2) Liveliness/Interest – the spiritual life.</p>
<p>For example, if a creature wants to ensure its existence, struggling to satisfy hunger, cold, and housing, this is called survival. Life, in addition to striving for survival, also requires a rich sense of interest. In other words, life is joyful and upward-moving. The interest in life—liveliness—is the driving force behind social evolution. If life has no interest, then nothing has the hope of evolving; such a life becomes a stagnant life. A society organized by humans with this kind of life is also bound to be stagnant and will never evolve. Therefore, I say that life is not just about living for survival; life must have meaning and interest. The major obstacles on the path of social evolution will naturally be easier to resolve.</p>
<p>Taking human life and animal life as an example: animal life is simple and can only be described as survival. Humans not only need to survive, but also have lives that animals do not possess, namely, the so-called spiritual life. The difference between humans and animals lies in this point. Therefore, humans are called "rational animals." There is a kind of spiritual activity in human life, which is thought, emotion, and will. This kind of spiritual activity can produce multifaceted effects. Through the activity of thought, all truths in science and philosophy are discovered; it is the source of knowledge and philosophy. From the activity of emotion, the beauty hidden in nature is inspired, and art with diverse forms and different interests is created, allowing human life to experience the edification and enjoyment of beauty. The interest of life is built on the foundation of this emotional activity. Through the activity of will, behavior and morality are expressed. These three are unique to rational animals. Although animals have a brain, they do not use thought. Animals may have emotional functions, but they lack noble and beautiful sentiments, and they generally lack what is called aesthetic sense. Therefore, there is no discovery of scientific knowledge, nor a life of interest or a life of beauty.</p>
<p>In order to cope with the environment, both humans and animals originally have a kind of ability to survive. For example, human life needs clothing, housing, and food; animals also know to find food to avoid hunger, to live in mountain caves to avoid wind and rain and to defend against other creatures. They grow long fur on their bodies to protect themselves from the heat and cold. Fierce claws and teeth, and great strength, their power to resist external enemies is several times stronger than that of humans, but why can't animals not only win against humans, but are instead subdued by humans? Humans are advancing on the track of evolution every day, while animals are only slowly moving towards the realm of degeneration. The reason is that their lives are only about survival.</p>
<p>Since we are called rational animals, then we should all live in human life. Whatever life animals do not have, humans uniquely have; whatever life animals cannot do, humans can do. This kind of life that animals do not have and cannot do depends entirely on the beautiful emotions in our spiritual activities to create. Because emotion is the engine for creating everything, only a life of emotion is an interesting life. We must not only focus on measuring and calculating material life, but also need the adjustment of spiritual life, so that life has a rich interest and seeks spiritual pleasure. For example, as mentioned earlier, don't animals also have clothing, food, and shelter? However, they are ultimately inferior to human clothing, which is particular about being warm in winter and cool in summer, and able to suit our body temperature; food that is fresh and delicious; and housing that is grand and exquisite. Where do they have the qualification to enjoy this kind of life?</p>
<p>Furthermore, like cultivating temperament and enjoying life through music, painting, etc., using the combination of sounds to express beautiful melodies, using the combination of colors to create beautiful natural scenery, can animals create these pleasing things? Even if they can, they are ultimately different from humans in spirit. In short, this kind of beautiful performance is unique to human life. Humans demand a proper life and enjoy a pleasant life; the most important thing is to have an interesting life. To be a person without the interest of life is not human life, no different from animal life!</p>
<p>How can we cultivate a proper and interesting life? That must rely on the function of art, using the appreciation of artworks to train beautiful emotions, such as music, dance, drama, film, painting...etc., which are all very interesting arts. They can not only cultivate our temperament, but also adjust our lives, and be unknowingly integrated by art, gradually eliminating dirty thoughts and degenerate will, and moving towards the road of interesting life!</p>
<h3>Desolate Dream</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>Last night, in the deathly silence of a dark moon and cold wind, I suddenly had a dream.</p>
<p>I dreamed that I was wearing a black dress, draped in a long black veil, holding a small black flower, and I seemed to be lost in a desolate wilderness, hanging my head, and crying softly.</p>
<p>I forgot how long I cried, when suddenly, I heard a strange sound.</p>
<p>I felt surprised and delighted, because the sound seemed very familiar, and I felt surprised and delighted, because the sound seemed to be right above me. So I looked up and searched, and suddenly, my flesh and blood all boiled!</p>
<p>It was him! He was sitting on a high cloud, gently calling my name!</p>
<p>In an instant, I forgot everything, just staring at him! I saw him shedding tears for me, and he was waving to me. I also saw a thin rope hanging down from the cloud, but it did not hang down to my side, but hung in the distance where my hand could not reach. So I became anxious and shouted: "For you, even if I am crushed to pieces, I am willing!" and jumped up to grab the rope. However, just at that moment, with a bang, I woke up!</p>
<p>I woke up! I touched my eyes, and they were wet. My heart was pounding. I did not climb up to the cloud, nor was I crushed to pieces. I was hanging alone in the air, and my dream was over!</p>
<p>Ah! I am melancholy! Why did I have such a desolate dream in the deathly silence of a dark moon and cold wind?</p>
<h3>Twilight</h3>
<p>— Sudan</p>
<p>The swallows have not yet come, this March twilight, the yellow and confused wind! Gently.</p>
<p>Gently cold, it is already the end of March, why is the spring cold still so bleak? I need some warm flames, like the color of peach blossoms blooming, can you tell me? When will the peach blossoms bloom?</p>
<p>When the swallows fly here, the peach blossoms will bloom!</p>
<p>Is that so? Then I must take this opportunity to rush to Jiangnan, waiting for the swallows to fly, waiting in Jiangnan, waiting for the swallows to fly, waiting for the blooming peach blossoms, warm flames.</p>
<p>Well. There will be a lush spring there, let alone the length of the journey, but are you not afraid of the difficult journey? Really, are you not afraid?</p>
<p>Ah! It is a light shake of the head, is this a strength, or an expectation?</p>
<p>I don't want to talk anymore, I should cherish my words, I have so much contemplation and meditation, let me learn from a friend, and learn his deep silence! He said this is gold.</p>
<p>I am remembering, dreaming, vaguely thinking about spring, it is the past, and it is also the future, that distant dream of the horizon, I also love spring.</p>
<p>Like the distant sound of bells from the graceful shepherdesses on the Jiangnan meadow, light.</p>
<p>Lightly ringing, you say: I tell you, tomorrow, maybe it's tomorrow, we have to set off before dawn!</p>
<p>Go! Go to catch up with the dawn, to chase after spring, and grasp the warmth and laughter.</p>
<p>The setting sun is going home, the sunset is thick, I want to give you a cloud of sunset, or give you a gust of twilight wind.</p>
<p>The swallows have not yet come, this March twilight, the twilight wind! Gently.</p>
<h3>Crossroads</h3>
<p>— Yang Qiguang</p>
<p>Have you ever looked out at the crossroads? Have you ever found the directions of east, west, north, and south in the tide of people, the sea of people? Look, how many people are wandering in the middle! Tired and weak eyes, searching for a path, but where to go?</p>
<p>Now, there is no fog at the crossroads, not a trace of fog, only the dust from the chimneys, the mud stirred up by the rolling cars, the sighs of people… but you can push aside the stumbling blocks and seek your way!</p>
<p>It is very clear, when your eyes are not red and rotten from alcohol, and not intoxicated by the prosperity of the city, you will open your sharp eyes like a hawk, and seek a way in the crowd.</p>
<p>Going east from here is the noble street, with majestic buildings of gentry and landlords, and red palace walls waiting for you; going west, there are tired, sweating laborers; going south, there is sea breeze, the bright moon on the embankment, poems, and dreams of gold; north, there is biting sand, a bitter cold wind, a vast wilderness, and the people there have broad hearts, and kind faces...</p>
<p>How will you choose your path?</p>
<p>The crossroads are a whirlpool of flowing water, being rolled to the bottom, and then washed to the surface…</p>
<p>As for me? I am a person with a fixed direction, every day I walk in a certain direction, I know where my home is, where my companion is; where my friends are; where it will lead to my hopes and the other shore of my desires!</p>
<h3>Flying Together (March 8th)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Truly, Mrs. Weng the Second has become haggard and out of shape this year, which is also something that saddens her! Because of her bad mood and hard work, she naturally looks older than usual, and she no longer wears her usual fancy clothes. Therefore, she looks even more disheveled.</p>
<p>The two little girls stared at Mrs. Weng the Second, as if looking at a stranger.</p>
<p>"Xiaoyun! Why don't you call me Mom? Don't you recognize Mom?" Mrs. Weng the Second pulled Xiaoyun over and said in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>Xiaoyun didn't say anything. In Xiaoyun's memory, this was the first time Mrs. Weng the Second had called her so gently and lovingly, and caressed her. In her little heart, she was wondering if she could believe that this was the mother who had abandoned her! She was stunned for a while before twisting and calling out "Mom" unnaturally, but there was no enthusiastic expression.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weng the Second then pulled Lihua over and kissed Lihua's forehead affectionately, saying:</p>
<p>"This child is getting more and more beautiful! Are you studying?"</p>
<p>Lihua shook her head with a smile.</p>
<p>"Why don't you say anything, quickly call her Godfather!" Mrs. Mo pushed Lihua and said.</p>
<p>"Godfather!" Lihua also called out unnaturally. She no longer smiled, she felt sad in her heart at this moment, because she had not called "Dad" for a long time, and now, it stirred up her memories, her memories of Mr. Mo! She missed Mr. Mo again! She thought of Jingzhou, where Mr. Mo was buried, and the home that held countless memories of Mr. Mo!</p>
<p>Because of the words "Godfather," Mrs. Weng the Second immediately remembered Baoling, who would never call her Godfather, so she asked Mrs. Mo:</p>
<p>"Where's Baoling? Why didn't you bring him?"</p>
<p>"Sigh!" Mrs. Mo sighed before speaking. "Sister, don't mention him! This child is getting worse and worse, just like his father's temper when he was young, if he wants to go east, you must never let him go west. This is fate! I feel like I gave birth to this son for nothing!" Mrs. Mo's eyes were a little red when she said the last sentence.</p>
<p>"But Brother Mo became amiable later, Baoling will also become amiable in the future, young people always like to be willful," Mrs. Weng the Second comforted Mrs. Mo. There was a double meaning in what she said, because her Shi Wang Lou was also "willful."</p>
<p>After exchanging pleasantries for a while, Mrs. Weng the Second invited Mrs. Mo and her daughters to sit in the house. Mrs. Mo glanced around the environment of this house, and instinctively made her immediately concerned about Mrs. Weng the Second's life.</p>
<p>"How is Boss Shi? How are things going lately?"</p>
<p>"Hard to say! Hard to say!" Mrs. Weng the Second answered Mrs. Mo appropriately using a familiar Peking opera line. This sentence contained thousands of inner feelings!</p>
<p>Mrs. Weng the Second took some candy and arranged for the two little sisters, Lihua and Xiaoyun, to go to the outer room. She and Mrs. Mo, the two old sisters, sat in the inner room to talk.</p>
<p>The grievances of the past year and more, the torment of the past year and more, burst out like a river that had broken its banks, and Mrs. Weng the Second poured out her heart to Mrs. Mo without any concealment. Naturally, there was also sweetness in the bitterness; there was also happiness in the sorrow; but ultimately, the sweetness and happiness were less than the bitterness and sorrow, especially recently. Some of Mrs. Weng the Second's happy expectations had now almost completely shattered! She no longer tried for anything, she just hoped to quietly accompany Shi Yulou for the rest of her life. She abandoned Mr. Weng because she hated Mr. Weng, but she couldn't bear Shi Yulou abandoning her, because she loved Shi Yulou. She certainly understood that Shi Yulou's recent bad temper was due to his poor situation, but she was also afraid that Shi Yulou had changed his mind! Therefore, she often felt worried about her own aging appearance.</p>
<p>"I never thought that I would still be suffering so much torment now! But I endured it! Because I feel satisfied as long as he is by my side. It would be fine if it could continue like this, as long as no other problems arise," Mrs. Weng the Second said, her eyes becoming a little wet again.</p>
<p>"What you said is true, this is fate! We can only resign ourselves to fate. I think Boss Shi is not a cunning person, if you are so devoted to him, he will not let you down," Mrs. Mo comforted Mrs. Mo with sympathy. There was a feeling of infinite emotion in her tone.</p>
<h3>Mouth Flute</h3>
<p>— Chen Gan</p>
<p>The bright moon is gradually rising. The little children in the village gathered under the big tree, and after singing simple, rambling folk songs in unison, they were listening to the melodious sound of the mouth flute. The desolate and mournful sound waves, floating in the boundless space, made the stars with their ghostly eyes even brighter.</p>
