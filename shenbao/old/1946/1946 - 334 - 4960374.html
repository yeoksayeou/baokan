<h3>多數代表意見反對政協憲草　未宣誓代表今補行宣誓</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕國民大會廿九日舉行第四次會議，開始對憲法草案作廣泛之討論，晨九時四十分洪秘書長報吿，報到一六二七人，出席一四三三人，已足法定人數，旋由左舜生主席領導行禮開會，首由報吿負宣續第三次會議紀錄，繼由洪秘書長報吿祝賀大會開會文片及代表請假函片（從略）。左主席報吿主席團決定事項：（一）依照議事規則第五條之規定，大會席次由主席團定之，經主席團第五次會議決議，就代表產生單位分別區劃，抽籤排定，至各單位代表之座次，則依國民政府公布名單之次序編列之，並續經主席團第六次會議分別抽定各代表會塲席次。（二）依照國民大會組織法第九條及各審査委員會組織通則第二條之規定，組織代表資格審査委員會，由主席團推定委員及召集人。左氏報吿畢，遴選代表薛篤弼，提出公文一件聲稱，其父薛士選年事過高，請自代表資格審委會之名單中取銷，另補他人。九時五十分左主席宣吿，請各代表就憲草廣泛發表意見，但不成立任何結論，而使各種意見分別送達各審査小組，以供參攷旋即依廿八日聲請發言之次序開始討論，洪秘書長首宣讀自由職業代表朱經農之書面意見，建議各代表在大會中提出大問題討論，小問題則留諸審査小組，以經濟時間。其次，豫職業代表陳繼先提出兩項意見，其一爲憲草修正案第一條中「美國式之民有民治民享與國父主張不同，請大家注意」。其二爲「代表宣誓極爲重要，未曾宣誓之代表，應先補行手續，始能討論憲法」。陳氏第二點意見提出後，會塲頓吿緊張，會衆拒絕主席團決定之分別簽名宣誓辦法，堅主應公開補行宣誓禮，旋又有代表提出代表資格尙未審定，不能討論憲法，而代表資格審委會之組織人數人選依法應由大會決定。當由遴選代表張厲生以國大代表選舉事務所主委身份加以解釋稱：國府所公布之代表，均經該所依選舉法第四條之規定嚴格審査，發給代表資格證書，現大會已開至第四次會議，尙進行資格之審査，仍係恐代表資格證書有僞造情事，以使代表之資格更加確定，純爲表示愼重與大會之進行無妨，然會衆仍主旣審査即應澈底審査，對曾爲漢奸之代表加以檢舉，以正視聽。同時並根據審委會通則之第二條規定，指責主席團及秘書處，謂是項名單之通過本無問題，唯僅將是項先決之人數及人選名單報吿大會，並於事先由中央社率然發布之行爲，乃違法凟權之舉，一時全塲紛紛發言，攻擊斥責如怒漸洶湧，而法定人數之計算方式之解釋問題更推波助瀾，至十時五十分秩序大亂，左主席乃急接受會衆建議，將名單付諸表決，結果多數贊成通過，宣吿休息。至十一時廿分繼續開會，洪秘書長報吿，適纔主席團集會，決議三事：（一）尙未宣誓之代表，於三十日上午第五次會議中公開補行宣誓禮。（二）主席團依議事規則第六十一條對法定人數之計算，以國府公布者爲標準。（三）發言請至台前正中擴音器前，以求淸晰，而維秩序。於是一塲風暴乃吿結束，開始對憲草之討論。</p>
<h3>白崇禧昨召集九次綏靖會議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕白崇禧廿九日下午六時，在國防部會議室，宴請政院綏靖區政委會委員張厲生，兪鴻鈞等，及察，魯，熱，豫，蘇等省主席，宴後舉行第九次綏靖會議。</p>
<h3>國大代表資格決定分組審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕國大代表資格審査委員會，廿九日上午八時在大會堂二樓代表休息室舉行首次會議，由張厲生主席，決定審査方法：（一）分若千組進行審査。（二）通知大會秘書處請各代表送繳當選證書以便審査。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕粵職代表陳若勤稱，憲草修正案中，立法院之權限較英美議會之權限猶大，國大之權限盡被剝削，僅餘對總統之選舉權與罷免權及對憲法之創制權與複決權，主張恢復國大應有之四種政權。以全責在代表人民監督政府之國大，徒有其名，而無實照。</p>
<p>川區代表吳階平稱：國大作爲討論根據之憲草修正案，在立院完成立法程序，僅費數小時之工夫，此種事實實爲千古奇聞，其用權之草率，亦屬違反民主者。修正案中，立院權限太大，渠本人反對集權，亦反對制衡。總統制及內閣制均爲國父所不取，大會應依權能劃分之遺敎，對此點詳硏愼訂。又對選舉事務之管理，主張在憲法中，規定由民意機關負責，以杜流弊。</p>
<p>華僑表劉如心稱，全世界各地華僑，均一致願爲祖國之建設努力，要求以明確之保僑政策，列入憲法。</p>
<p>湘職代表陳詠弦，主張三事：（一）國大代表選舉，應兼採職業選舉制。（二）婦女代表之名額，應予規定。（三）憲草修正案竊五權之名，行三權之實，似美憲又似渦去之聯省自治法，値得研究，更訂爲一適合國情符合時代之國家根本大法，否則縱制憲亦如未制。</p>
<p>浙職代表吳望伋，亦主張兼採職業選舉，以匡區域選舉之不逮。並謂，憲草修正案中之立院，除不能將男變女外，無事不能爲中央治權機關。行政院受其牽制，司法院成爲附庸，監察院不能監察，考試院不能考銓，中央政權機關國大對其亦不能控制，一般人民將其選出後，更屬遙不可即，如是之立院，勢必無法無天。主張大會對其職權地位，應有所調整。至此已十二時正，洪秘書長代左主席宣佈，三時繼續開會。</p>
<h3>國大商界代表</h3>
<p>要求恢復國民經濟章</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕國大商界代表，廿九日晚應全國商聯會之邀，共商（一）職業代表制及，（二）國民經濟一章應予恢復兩問題，到陳勤士，韓光琦，朱惠淸等五十餘人，首由商聯會理事長王曉籟致詞，說明憲法中關於選舉國大代表及主委，監委等條款，僅有區域代表，而忽略職業代表，此點實與總理遺敎遠背，其次，原五五憲草記有國民經濟一章，內共十四條，而目前之修正案，將該章删去，僅於　　國策中，有五條涉及國民經濟，而　　人最有關係之商人保障及捐稅等條款，則予删去，忽視工商利益，莫此爲甚。農工商爲立國根本，若僅注意治國之黨政車，而置農工商於不顧，無異捨本逐末，欲求建國，勢不可能，建議商界與農工等聯合，共同力爭。當經決議用集體力量，向國大憲草審査會分章提出提案。</p>
<h3>戰略顧問委會組織條例公布　該會直屬於國府主席</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕國府明令公布戰略顧間委員會組織條例，原文如下：</p>

<p>第五條，本條例自公布日施行</p>
<h3>國大四次會議側寫</h3>
<p>— 本報記者濮德玠　張明</p>
<p>二十八日鎭日大雪後，二十九日之國民大會堂，猶御銀裝，牌樓上，會堂頂，方漸溶於初　陽光下之白雪，眩目奇麗，與建築上之朱漆金描，及仍未枯盡之靑草綠樹，蔚爲大觀。</p>
<p>四次會議主席由左舜生担任，左氏雍容大方，鎭定有餘，但說話時，總距擴音器過遠，會衆多不能盡聆其語意，也是秩序欠佳的一個原因。</p>
<p>國大代表二十九日開始依新席次入座，許多代表都找不到號頭，有人笑着對一位蒙古代表說：「我們在前面，邊疆作領導了」。某代表說：「哈！熟人都坐到一塊兒來了」，某代表說：「限制交際，有點封建味道」</p>
<p>馬星野吿訴記者說：「我和黄少谷先生都在人民權　審査組，我們要提出憲法中應明列新聞自由，聯合國憲章中都列了專條呢」！</p>
<p>開會前白宗禧和陳誠遇到一起，耳語片刻。鄭彥棻從自己的新位子出發，向左前方轉了一小圈，打着廣東國語交際一番。</p>
<p>孫科是主席團第四組的首席主席，曾兩次升降主席台，第一次是當一部分代表應公開補行宣誓問題提出後，第二次是在十時五十五分，秩序亂到不能維持時，他上台邊走邊向左主席和洪秘書長說一句話後，左主席就在混亂中宣佈「休息」，結束了這一塲爭鬧。</p>
<p>補行宣誓問題提出後，洪秘書長報吿說：「主席團已決定將誓詞發交各未及參加開幕式行宣誓禮的代表，請他們塡印簽章後交還」，豫職代表陳繼先說：「不對，宣誓是堂堂正正的事，爲何要偷偸摸摸？應公開補行。」洪又說：「如對補行宣誓之方式有異議，可請主席團另商辦法」。結果定在三十日大會公開補行宣誓。</p>
<p>關於代表資格審查委員會之名單，和曾經附逆代表之檢舉問題，引起軒然大波，對前者之僅對大會作報吿未徴求同意一點，羣　爲違反審委會組織通則第十一條「代表資格審查委員會之人數及人選，由主席團提請大會決定之」之規定。陳繼先說：「這張名單還沒經過大會決定，就由中央社作了官方發佈，請問秘書處是故意違法，還是昏憒，請失職的秘書長辭職」。另一豫職代表王叔惠也作同樣質詢，並要求洪秘書長解釋，洪立起來想說話，王又說：「我的話還沒完，請秘書長坐下。」洪只好坐下，王乃再就次一問題加以責難：「對代表附逆之檢舉，洪秘書長先前以『司法問題』輕輕帶過，等張代表厲生以選舉總事務所主委資格發言後，却又無法解釋，試問如果代表僅僅保全了當選證書，而沒有保全人格，秘書長是否可以負責？我們要求嚴格審查，不能讓漢奸加入神聖的制憲工作。」</p>
<p>爲了一張名單提出公佈的手續不合，代表們大興問罪之師，有的說：「主席團是爲了大會人太多，替大會服務的，不是代表大會決定一切。」有的說：「主席團的權限太大了，秘書長的權也不小，還要我們代表作什麼？」有的說：「只須主席不要怕麻煩，自然不會有麻煩，這是法的問題，不是故意找麻煩。」有的說：「這張名單大家不會有問題的，如果主席團在報吿後就徴求大家的同意，一定通過，我們是要提醒主席團注意法律規定，尊重大會的地位。」</p>
<p>休息前，發言者如雨後春筍，秩序大亂，能力排衆人奪得發言權的人，講時也吃排頭。國大開會以來，第三個發言的女代表郭昌鶴，在那時提出了主席團女主席吳貽芳辭職的事，說應該由次數多的女代表遞補，可惜她的話無人注意，朱經農說：「請各位同仁注意，依戚事規則，我們發言須先得主席的同意。」「你呢？」「噓噓！」</p>
<p>在混亂中，左主席宣佈表決那張名單，電燈明了一大半。休息時間一位代表說：「還是沒照法的規定人數和人選應分開依次表決。」另一位代表說：「馬馬虎虎算了，左舜生還是第一次作主席，饒了他吧。」</p>
<p>馬沈慧運在休息時間才到會，她說：「我到下關給難童發衣服去了，一直到現在才發完，凍壞我了。」記者說：「他們可煖和了不少。」她笑了。一位曾在南京紅十字會裏工作過的大會職員說：「我們會長人好極了，又能幹又熱心。」</p>
<p>第四次會議代表們佔了上風，前半秩序雖然亂，但法治與民主的精神貫注全塲。當休息後問題解決了時，展開對憲章的討論，一帆風順地直到散會。大家都認爲如果代表們能對議事規則上關於討論的部份再加注意一點，主席團和秘書處能對他們和大會的關係釐訂得再分明一點，國大的會議必能變得完美無疪。有人說：「現在的大會本身，是在訓政時期。」</p>
<p>包德明女代表的發言中，曾大大的捧了新聞記者的塲。她說：記者先生們，是人民的喉舌，也是尊重女權的，所以如果輿論能帮助，一定可以達到目的。</p>
<p>某代表認爲總統章應增預備總統時，全塲啞然。但某代表很鎭靜的說：「你們不要奇怪、本來是應該奇怪，但是渦後就不奇怪了。世界各國均係三權制度，唯我總理創五權憲法，當初我國很奇怪，後來就不奇怪了。</p>
<p>蒙古代表劉踪萍發言慷慨激昂，連說：「我們走過千山萬水，吃盡千辛萬苦，到這裏來是做什麼的，我們要做中華民國的國民。」熱情充沛，獲得全塲同悄。</p>
<p>某代表發言，聲浪做作，言之無物，並且隨時說：「你們」，大有退出代表立塲說話之槪，全塲立即報以嗤嗤之聲，並喝倒彩。到最後一位先生發言時，更列舉數點，希望大家注意，什麽要尊嚴，要鄭重的能度，全塲代表如在聽訓，頗不以爲然。</p>

<h3>法越衝突迄未停止　僑胞損失數千萬　我向雙方提出嚴重交涉</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕法越軍隊在海防發生衝突，我國駐河內總領事袁子健，已奉外交部電訟，向法越雙方嚴重交涉，要求將華僑區劃出作戰區域以外，以免損害華僑。</p>
<p>〔中央社海防廿七日電〕（遲到）中央社記者隨法越混合委員人員來此調停法越衝突，廿一日雙方舉行數次會議後，以雙方意見未能一致，戰事於廿二日繼續進行，十九日衝突中，我駐海防領館廿二日被越武裝份子射擊，謝領事辦公室亦被擊中，廿二日以後運日戰鬥中，法軍均使用重武器，向越人集中區攻擊，華僑區域亦被波及，經五日之戰鬥，法軍逐漸推進，已控太部區城，越人則以華僑區爲掩護抵杭，市內多處大火，據稱：華僑區內數處被燬，此問中文剛島日報人員，均在越人區域，消息不明，該報已一週未出版。此次衝突中，華僑損失恐將達越幣數千萬元以上。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿八日電〕據悉：法國政府對於越南衝突事件，正考慮趕派援軍前往該處，協助維持秩序。西貫最近來電稱二法國軍隊已將越南共和軍隊逐出海防華僑區，該處及諒山兩地，戰事仍在進行中。海防飛機塲已被法軍所派遺之傘兵于五百名奪回。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社河內廿八日電〕法越兩國軍隊在海防　諒山之間，發生衝突之後，頃悉衝突業已停止，海防且已恢復常態，一切安謐，電台公司亦已復工。中國領事已向越南當局交涉，要求開釋無故被捕之華僑二名。此外，中國駐在越南之團體，已將法越衝突經過，電吿蔣主席。法方死傷甚少，據諒山華僑協會主席談稱，華僑無死傷。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社河內廿九日電〕頃悉：北圻　卡巴　越軍海岸砲台，今日向法國巡洋艦「蘇弗倫」號及護衛艦一艘轟擊，但未釀成何項損失。法國駐北圻及中圻專員　里埃已向越盟共和國總統胡志明提出抗議，謂渠將被迫採取一切適當措置，避免此類絕對的敵視行動再現。</p>
<h3>善救物資秉公分配　絕無裝備軍隊事　行總發言人駁覆董必武</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本月廿七日中共代表董必武氏曾發表聲明，對於行總分配善救物資事宜有所指陳。記者爲明瞭眞相起見，特走訪行總發言人，承吿如下：聯總物資之處理問題、依照國民政府與聯總間之基本協定，凡善救物資之分配，儲運，發放，均須與聯總人員咨商辦理，尤以物資之發放，聯總在各省分署均駐有區域代表，觀察物資之　放。董必武先生謂：「當局曾直接或間接使用聯總物資器材與交通工具以裝備軍隊」，顯無事實根據。聯總在華工作人員包括世界各國國民，均可證明董先生此言缺乏事實根據。</p>
<p>共區交通阻隔</p>
<p>本署爲基本協定之執行機構，自成立以來，即根據聯總議決案第二條，一視同仁之原則（Non-Iscrmi-nation　Principle），不斷努力，向中共要求准許本署物資及人員進入中共控制區救濟該區之災民，並予本署人員以工作上便利。一年以來，本署不斷向中共區域運輸救濟物資，奈大部中共控制區始終在軍事狀態下，戰鬥頻仍，交通阻隔，物資運輸時遭阻碍，人員工作無安全保障，此爲客觀環境之困難，非本署單獨努力所能解除老。</p>
<p>忽略重要事實</p>
<p>董先生謂：「在聯總抵華物資一·一三〇三·三四九噸中，中共區迄今祇收到九·八二〇噸，其比例僅及千分之七點五」。電先生所求得之比例，僅係抽象之計算，而忽略重要之事實。按全國各地並非每省均有中共控制區，漢東北，冀，　，魯，豫，鄂，皖，蘇等省有中共控制區之存在。上達各地，本署設有八個分署，如計算中共控制區收到物資之百分比，應以上列八個分署所得物資之　和爲　數，不應以本　所發各分署物資之總和爲標準。截至本年十月底，上列八個分署共收到物資二二四·二〇七噸，發往中共控制區之物資爲二萬二千餘噸，其比率應爲百分之十，而非千分之七·五。且聯　物資並非全部業已發放，一部物資正在加工裝配，一部尙在運輸途中，且若干重型器材並非中共控制區所需要，如鐵路器材，共方並無鐵路機構，倘予分配，無異浪費。董氏謂「醫藥器材共區僅收到五十餘噸」。此係六月以前之數字，目前中共控制區已收到醫藥三百餘噸矣。</p>
<p>推翻聯總議決</p>
<p>董氏　請聯　在中共控制區直接進行物資之分配與發放，並謂「中共解放區善後救濟總會　給予最有效之州助」。余可答覆董先生，聯　理事會議決案巳有規定，接受救濟之國家之救濟事宜均由各該國政府自行辦理聯總不得直接辦理，　本協定亦有同樣之規定。董氏聲明係要求維　聯總　決案及　本協定，今作此種　詛無異推翻聯總議決案及基本協定矣。總之，本署對於物資之分配一向根據聯總議決案之原則，無任何歧視，今後亦將　一貫精神，加强各地之救濟，以人民之需要爲重，而無任何歧視，耿耿初衷，必爲各方所諒解也。</p>
<h3>訪問國大代表　胡定安博士談衛生行政</h3>
<p>記者爲了關心「民族健康」的大問題，特走訪醫藥師代表胡定安博士，胡氏現任國立江蘇醫學院院長兼中國公共衛生學社常務理事，他對公共衛生提倡夙且熱忱，曾於前天大會中散發了一本「憲法中爲何不列人衛生行政」的小册子於全體代表，詳細闡述「衛生行政」與「憲政」關係之密切，憲章中應以國民健康爲　國之基本。記者叩詢胡氏對此次提出憲法有無修正的具體意見？胡氏解答這個詢問，便臚舉蘇聯憲法一百廿條與一百廿二條都是保障國民健康，有積極貫澈的政策，二次世界大戰後，美英法等國更認爲國民健康僞國家之資源，尤以英國本年三月問公布之衛生法案「全國人民，享受免費治療」，　國之新人權宣言廿一條「國民健康與孕婦之保護公共衛生以及由科學而來之各種措施國家保證全民皆能享受」最爲顯著</p>
<p>我國人民壽命之短促與疾病率之高，嬰兒死亡率之驚人，提高健康水準，實爲時代上迫切要求，所以本人極願約醫界同仁提出對於憲法中必須有明確規定保健與預防更進而增進國民健康之條文，才能適合建國的需要，還很希望新聞界同仁更予以與論上助力爲之宣傳「健康的重要意義」，這份健康權利，文明國家人民必須爭取的；年來我們大家提倡民族健康及衛生敎育，也就本着提高健康水準而努力推進的。</p>
<p>大雪紛飛，客窗下談話了十餘分鐘，我們對於「健康問題」，談得很熱烈，也不覺其寒冷而就結束了。我們在記者立塲，也寄以共同倡導的同情。</p>
<h3>全國鐵路海港視察工作完成　損毀鐵路修復至戰前程度　預計需費美金三億八千萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院工程計劃團視察關內各鐵路及海港工作，已吿完成，現正整理總報吿書，以備呈交政院。報吿書內，包括視察經過，損毁程度，修復所需之材料，經費，時間等。關內原有鐵路一萬二千公里左右，目前損毁者達三千餘公里，其中一牛以上係遭共軍所破壞。將全部損毁之鐵路，修復至戰前程度，約需經費三億八千萬元美金，已超過當初關內全部鐵路之鋪築費　即使國內局勢穩定，經費材料皆無問題，最少亦需費時二年半，始克完成此項修復工作。</p>
<p>交通部定於明年加緊修復浙贛路，强化粤漢路。成渝路現已復工。明年尙擬鋪築天水闌州段，及廣州　柳州段。以期完成理想中之西北西南兩大幹綫。</p>
<p>至於　港，自葫蘆島至海南島，損毁狀况不如鐵路之甚。據該團估計，修復至戰前狀况，並略加改善，約需八千萬元美金。</p>

<h3>蘇北五里莊等處收復　淮陰情形已穩定　膠東共軍增兵局勢又緊</h3>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>我們所主張的地方制度</h3>
<p>中華民國的憲法要制定了，我們覺得五五憲草的「地方制度」一章，以及憲草修正案關於「地方制度」一款，均有檢討的必要，我們就把我們自己幾十年來研究的心得，貢獻出來，作一個參考。</p>
<p>我們也是主張中國應有一種均權的地方制度的。要得均權，我們以爲先要實行一個「分」字，中央與地方之間，近自民國成立，更是含混不淸，於是中央總說地方割據，不能奉行國家法令；而各級地方政府以及一般人民，又以中央趨於極端的中央集權，動轍干涉，無從談到自治。矯正這種積弊，我們以爲最好一切分開來，分開以後，各人辦各人的事，各人保持各人的立塲，互不干涉。</p>
<p>怎採分呢？第一：我們主張省縣市鄕鎭均分列爲地方單位，什麽是地方單位？（一）必有一定區域；　必有居民，（三）必有組織，這種組織，必爲法人，因爲是法人，所以可爲法律上的被吿與原吿，可有財產，並有財產處分權，可訂合法契的，可以徵收捐稅；（四）必有預算；其上只有監督機關並無指揮機關。地方單位旣然是這樣的解釋，中國的地方單位，顯然應該是：（一）省（二）市（院屬市或省屬市）；（三）縣；（四）鄉；（五）鎭。</p>
<p>市鄉鎭是最基本的地方單位，因爲市鄉鎭以下，再無地方單位，市鄕鎭在法國爲Commune，在德國爲Gemeinde，俱是認爲最　本的。鄕鎭如果不與市站在一條綫上，問不合理，鄉鎭也永無建立起來的希望，歐美的小型都市與一般鄕村爲什麽達到那樣現代化？就是因爲他有一個自治的政府。</p>
<p>第二：我們主張國家行政與自治行政明白劃分。劃分方式有三：（一）國家行政與自治行政列舉；（二）國家行政列舉，其未列　者即爲自治行政；（三）自治行政列舉，其未列舉者即爲國家行政。我們主張川第三種方式。</p>
<p>劃分程序，我們主張國家先與省市（院屬市）劃分，然後省與縣市（省屬市）再作合理的分配，最後縣自治行政，再轉而分配與鄕鎭單位。市鄕鎭爲最接近居民的地方單位，我們主張市鄕鎭所分配到的自治行政事項宜多。舉一個例：下列十七項應　列爲自治行政的一部份，並且應　分配與市鄕鎭單位：（一）消防；（二）社會敎育：（三）道路橋樑，（四）公園區塲；（五）水利；（六）交通（電車·公共汽車等）；（七）電燈；（八）煤氣；（九）公共飲水；（十）陌生、（十一）食料管理；（十二）輕濟事業；（十三）地方銀行；（十四）合作事業；（十五）救濟；（十六）房屋管理；（十七）公營事業。自治的目的，在居民自謀福利，　十七項自治行政，如山中央代謀，必然不關痛　；若謂居民把　了　十七項，就可反抗中央，宣佈獨立，誰也不會相信；相反的。中央政府把握了軍事。外交·警察·貨幣·關稅·國防工業·幹錢交通，敎育政策，以及制度等等，誰有反抗中央宣佈獨立的能力？</p>
<p>第三：我們主張國家稅源與自治稅源明白劃分：這也可用國家行政與自治行政劃分的原則與分配方式，這就是說：自治稅源列舉，其未列舉者，即爲國家稅源。國家稅源與省市（院屬市）劃分以後，省與縣市（省屬市）再作合理的分配，縣更轉而分配之於鄉鎭。惟有一點必須注意：實行自治的國家，士地稅（田賦）多列在自治稅源以內。因此，中國的自治稅源，最緊要的還是田賦一項。</p>
<p>第四：我們主張谷地方單位首長提名選舉。地方單位首長有兩種身份，一是中央政府的代表，在地方上承中央政府（或其代表人）之命，辦理國家行政事項，另一是地方自浩團體的首長，遵照自治的立法機構決議，辦理自治行政事項，他旣然代表兩方，爲什麽由一方選定？因此，我們認爲民選省長縣長，並不是公允的辦法，大陸國家的縣長，多由中央任命，舉一個例，法國的縣長；並不由人民選舉。中國封建思想，未盡淸除，凡有割據的可能，務必要根除凈盡。省長縣長民選，誰能保證他在地方上忠實的執行中央政令？一轉變間，而稱雄一方，都是意中之事。有人說，英美的地方單位首長，都由民選，爲什麽民主的中國不由民選？這有兩個答案，一是英美乃極端地方分權的國家，二是英美在地方上應辦的國家行政事項，多另設分支機構，直接指揮辦理，此其原因，就是因爲地方自治政府，都由民選，不能有效的奉行中央命令，折衷於大陸制度與英美制度之間，我們主張各地方單位首長，由中央政府提名若干，交由地方居民選舉，或由地方居民選舉若干，報請中央擇一任命。</p>
<p>第五：我們主張各單位首長下分列中央機構與自治機構，各單位首長旣有兩方面的事要辦，與其混在一起辦不淸楚，何不把辦事機構明明白白的分開兩起？一爲中央機構，而另一爲自治機構。但首長只是相同的一個人，中央機構，一唯中央政府（成其代表人）的命令是從，辦理國家行政事項，其預算是國家預算的一部份，臨時委辦事項，如建築，飛機塲等等，也由中央另撥專款，下動地方分文，自治機構，辦理自治行政，以地方立法機構的決議爲從違，依照自治預算。只對地方負責、中央機構與自治機構發生行政糾紛，由行政法院裁決，中央政府（或共代表人），不能以訓令解決兩方面的糾紛。劃分中央機構與自治機構的辦法，並不是我們發明的普魯士的制度，就是這樣，並且行之有效，行政法院解決中央與地方糾紛的辦法，法國行之最早。世界上實行自治的國家，除了英美而外，幾乎都是這樣的。</p>
<p>第六：我們主張各地方單位，同時開始自治，但自治範圍儘可不同，經濟條件不够而實行自治，無異紙上談兵，智識條件不够而實行自治，簡直是盲人騎着瞎馬。中山先生看到這一點，所以有訓政時期的規定。我們主張確定自治條件，條件够的地方，自治行政全部事項，交由自治機構去辦；自治條件不够的地方，以立法程序，提出若干事項，委託同級中央機構代辦。一俟條件許可，再行歸還自治機稱，邊疆地方，文化經濟落後，在條件上講，自然談不到自治，然也不妨開始一項兩項。舉一個例，救濟消防，似乎總是辦得了的。這種方式，也不是我們所發明，英國各級地方政府所辦的自治行政事項，就各不相同，英國的自治行政，是點點滴滴的從國會法案爭取得來的。</p>
<p>上面六項，是我們的綜合主張，我們覺得惟有這樣，才能得至一部均權的憲法。這部均權憲法我們試在執政黨方面講實在可以收到意想不到的功效。第一，可以疏通全國人才，免以中樞爲鬥爭奪取的對象；第二，上自中央政府，下至市鄉鎭單位，俱有中央機構，一貫的奉行中央政令，而所謂自治，亦僅與居民生活有關的若干事項，不足據以爲反抗中央宜佈獨立的基礎。但如省長縣長無條件的民選，那就不能保險了。再站在在野黨講，也可解決若干問題，幷寄有無窮的希望。例如已經得到的地盤，若不還之中央，誰總說你是割據，如有這部均權憲法，則還之中央的，只是國家行政，而自治行政顯然仍奮可以控制。這豈不是又解決了當前所謂地方政權問題？第二，各級自治機構，除中央政府依法監督而外，幷不受上組機關的指揮各黨各派以及無黨無派，果然得到了一個地方單位的自治政構，也可施展抱負。但如國家行政與自治行政不分，或者國家稅源奧自治稅源不分，或者中央機構與自治機構不分，則執政黨的中央政府，難免不運用其混而不分的權能，干涉地方自治。</p>
<p>事到最後關頭，我們希望執政黨在野黨曁全國人士，考慮這一問題。也就是「我們所主張的地方制度」。</p>

<h3>對號車票價格失當</h3>
<p>勝利以後，兩路當局，對於交通方面，力圖整頓，殊可欽佩。自實行對號車後，秩序井然，旅客稱便，惟路局對於對號車票價，尤其金陵號錢塘號，二班對號京　聯　車，實欠公平。例如滬杭綫，全程計一百九十九公里，二等票價售八千五百元，但該二班列車，自上海至蘇州，或蘇州至上海，祗有路程入十六公里，較滬杭錢全程二分之一不到，然滬蘇間，所售二等車票，竟須一萬二千元，於情於理，確爲非宜。對號車固整　舒服，車行迅速，售價較貴於普通特別快車，亦無不可，惟萬不能將欲漲票價，全加於短程旅客，使短程旅客，吃虧太大。倘路局恐對號車旅客衆多，稍欲限止，則不妨依照特別快車票價，增收百分之若干對號費，亦爲適當辦法。</p>
<p>又京滬蘇州站，旅客素稱擁擠，筆者數次自蘇赴滬，一俟列車進站，車內早已滿坑滿谷，再加上蘇站大批旅客，有時車廂　板，亦無立足之地，年輕者尙可應付，而一般婦孺則苦矣。還望鐵路當局，添設蘇滬區間車，以利客遝，以上二項建議，盼路局即爲改善。（編者按）李榮華君對蘇州與常州凱旋號票價　亦來函聲述未妥，一併刊登。（陳學仁）</p>

<h3>國大三次會</h3>
<p>— 本報記者張明</p>
<p>—完成了還政於民的初步手續—</p>
<p>南京天氣急轉直下，今天雪花飛滿城，朱紅畫棟白，國大脾坊在風雪裏豎立着，赴會的代表，還是個個準時到達，九時前都已到齊。</p>
<p>蔣主席今天以國府主席的身份，把這一份中華民國憲法草案，隆重的在全國國民代表的面前，提交給大會主席胡適，在這授受的刹那，是給中華民國的歷史，劃上了分野的鴻滿，這個時間，是卅五年十一月廿八日上午九時四十五分。</p>
<p>國府主席和大會主席授受憲草時，國府主席是站在主席台前面的，首先把憲草遞上去，臨時主席則就主席位接受，這個鏡頭，是史無前例的。很多人說：「蔣主席以這樣姿態出現，是第一次。」</p>
<p>蔣主席的報吿，獲得了十餘次的滿堂彩，第一次鼓掌，是在主席說到：「國府今天提出此憲草，是開始將此責任交給全國國民，全國國民也就要從今天起，負起這個責任了　的時候。</p>
<p>對於五五憲草，蔣主席曾說到：「我站在人民代表的立塲，認爲已不適用，我是絕對擁護國府今日提出的憲草的。」全塲報以更熱烈的掌聲。</p>
<p>今日大會的程序，僅是提交憲草和報吿，沒有討論，所以會塲空氣始終是很調和，尤其因爲外面大雪紛飛，寒氣逼人，塲內的空氣，就顯得更溫暖。胡適以外交家·敎育家·老敎授的姿態，擔任主席，才有餘裕，可惜節且簡單，眞是英雄無用武之地。</p>

<p>余家菊有一個很好的插曲，也是使大會更生色的節目，就是在主席報吿以及洪氏官讀憲草全文後，所提出的書面意見，這是國民黨外，對憲草提出擁護之第一聲，也是開幕以來，各黨派中發表意見之第一砲，這一砲響得皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>休息時間內，代表們都到休息室內用點，窗外雪飛正酣，大家縮頸啜茗，有人說：「好像聖誕節，」聖誕老人，今天帶來的禮物，是一部憲草。宣讀　草時，女代表莊靜。嚴正的對記者說。「在立法一章裏，立委的名額，規定爲各省市人口未滿三百萬人者，每省市五人，如不規定女子的比數，則將來決不會有女的立委，我們打破頭也得爭，最低限度五比一。」</p>
<p>孫科解釋　草時，頻頻咳嗽。</p>
<p>雷震辭副秘長未准，今天首先還是在台下轉，到　近十二點的時候，才跑到台上坐在主席一旁　翻閱文件</p>
<p>水銀燈今天幾次開放攝影，記者受惠不淺。</p>
<p>宣讀憲草的時候，會塲中大部份是靜聽，小部份是左右張望，偶然有幾位則閱讀其他報紙雜誌，台上的陳果夫·胡庶華·都執筆作記，白崇禧以手支光頭。</p>
<p>十一時四十分，孔庚老人拿了一封信走上主席台，直交洪秘書長，而且一再說明似乎很重要，但是事後記者去問，却不得要領。</p>
<p>當針指到十二時處，主席胡適起立詢問代表，以大會延長一刻鐘的意見，語尾是「好不好？」極合對學生說話的語調。</p>
<p>休息室中，有人希望憲草無異議一氣通過，好早日回家。</p>
<p>民社黨蔣匀田今天出席了，因爲他是爲憲法而出席國大的。</p>

<h3>印政府改組經過（中）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐印記者周祥光</p>
<p>此乃印回兩敎對回盟參政的看法，我等第三者之意見，恐目前尙不能確定論斷，應看其來日發展，方知其眞意所在。嗣於本月二十日，各方咸盼眞納究舉何人入閣？但眞納將回盟參政人員五名公布後，又使印度敎徒大吃一驚，即五個回盟代表中，却有一位屬於賤民階級之印度敎徒孟德爾，現任孟加拉省府財政廳長，與　盟素有聯絡。</p>
<p>按印度賤民階級中，向有兩個組織：一屬於國大黨者，由羅摩所領導；此外爲賤民聯盟，即由孟德爾所領導，但二十年來，始終未經國大黨承認，而與回盟結不解緣。故此次眞納將此人舉出入閣，以未對抗國大黨之用　人（此即阿塞夫阿里）出席新政府也。當時，甘地老翁亦發了脾氣，謂賤民階級旣由國大黨舉出，何以自稱爲代表回敎之回盟要將印度教賤民代表選出，頗屬怪事。但眞納此舉殊屬聰明，博得外人拍手呌好。當時，德里「印度斯坦時報」繪有漫畫一幅，諷刺回敎，頗屬有趣。岡中畫一大母鷄，（即眞納）帶出四個小鷄，（即指回盟入閣代表）但在最後，却有一小鴨，（指賤民代表）使旁邊的老太婆（指總督）大吃一驚！賤民聯盟領袖孟德爾由回盟保薦人閣後，德里賤民千餘人齊集眞納公館，敬致謝意。眞納幷即席演說，謂我不但是你們的朋友，且永遠是你們的好朋友，我對於賤民利益無不設法相助等語。最後，千餘賤民呼口號「巴基斯坦！靜達巴！」即「回敎聖地萬步」之意，使印度敎徒見之亦怒亦笑。</p>
<p>回敎徒旣然參政，新政府各部位置分配問題遂爲國回兩黨及總督討論之中心。原來新政府中之兩回敎徒，一爲郵電航空部長柴希爾，文敎衛生部長可汗，以及工鑛部長鮑斯同時辭職，讓回盟代表入位。事先據聞：眞納要求總督給予回盟之各部爲外交或內政，供應或商業，國防或財政，而將工鑛部給予賤民代表孟德爾。但國防部長屬於錫克敎的包德申，商業部長屬於拜火敎的鮑甫氏，財政部長又屬於印度基督敎徒的梅德氏。此三部長均屬少數民族，不易讓出，而外部非屬於尼赫魯不可，內長一席國大黨又不願給回盟，因此部長分配問題即成爲印度臨時政府改組中最不易解決之問題。</p>

<h3>寒流襲上海路有凍死骨　普善山荘連日掩埋繁忙　救濟工作刻不容緩</h3>

<p>冬令嚴寒下貧民輩均深感嚴重威脅，尤以躑躅街頭無家可歸之難民乞丐，衣不蔽體，飢寒交迫，路斃者爲數日多。據普善山莊消息：前日該所收埋之街頭露屍計六十五具，其中五十四具係童屍。昨日更達七十餘其之多，大部份亦係童屍。速日掩埋工作極爲繁忙。</p>
<p>時僅初冬，路斃者之多已超過往年紀錄，將來嚴寒更甚，一冬貧民受凍餒而死之情形當不堪想像，故冬令救濟工作已急不容緩。據社會局方面消息：該局已於虹口通州路　扯建　，設立冬令庇寒所，現正趕裝水電設備，預期下月中可以開始收容難胞四千凡。行總已允撥首批棉被八百條，棉衣八百套，及每月每人麵粉一袋。經費方面市參議會曾通過撥發冬令難胞救濟費九億元，但社會局已收到者僅五千萬元，據聞市府不日可續撥三億五千萬元，中央允撥之二億元亦在呈請核發中，此外並望各界捐募，以加强救濟云。</p>

<h3>新稅法實施困難　商談後可望改善　谷局長返滬談話</h3>
<p>因立法院通過新稅法而引起之本市稅收問題，財政局長谷春帆前特晋京，向中央有關當局解釋，請重予考慮，以合地方情形，茲已返滬。記者前往叩詢，晋京商談經過，承吿稱：此次新稅法在本市實施上確有困難，故晋京與多方面商談，均稱可予設法改善，惟因此事涉及立法行政兩院及財政內政等部，非一人一語可決定，而宋院長又因公忙，兪部長又抱恙，均未能暢談，故無具體之答覆。最後谷氏並對外傳此次晋京與市預算有關事，表示實屬不確，因市府對市預算僅祇須向市參議會陳述，無須向中央請示，况所傳不敷之數達二千億之鉅，更不可靠。</p>
<h3>卅四年所利得稅　工商業不勝負担</h3>
<p>潘士浩表示應補救</p>
<p>本市直接稅局催征之三十四年度營利事業所利得，工商業中之不勝負担者，頗有煩言。聞商社當局以殭局總須打開，已定於星期日下午四時召開座談會，據潘士浩談稱：三十四年度營利事業所利得稅之簡化稽征，以部定預算不允再减，致有按申報盈餘課百分之一百五十之說。就常情而論，工商業之負担確已甚重，尤其是各業榮枯不同，去年年底之有盈餘者，今或已去失負担能力。而所謂照盈餘課百分之一百五十也者，實際之負担又或未能一律。一部份工商業之有責言，自屬難怪。惟商會當初之意，係爲請求免征旣屬不得，而調査稽征，各業更屬不願，乃於不得已之中，爲减少預算，照帳攤派之舉。今旣發現一部份工商業因申報額本已甚巨，加征非所能勝，自應設法補救。據潘氏表示：工商業日益困難，各種捐稅，應酌景變通。薪給及存息二稅，尤應顧全民力，停止征收。潘氏並稱此事如不獲圓滿解決，將晋京面見主管長官，務求轉　云。</p>

<h3>人力車改裝三輪　明日起檢騐發照</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕淘汰本市人力車，依照中央之命令，限於兩年內完成。至遲在三十七年秋季以前，本市人力車即須全部淘汰。故公用局鼓勵人力車及早改裝成單人後座三輪車，並擬具發照徴稅辦法，擬於明日起開始檢騐發照。其應收費用，牌照稅部分凡已經繳納人力車十二月份份車稅者，將於改領三輪車牌照後，免納車稅。其未經缴納人力車十二月份車稅者，准於改領三輪車牌照後，繳納三輪車下半年車稅六分之一，即十二月份一個月共計三千三百三十三元，（作三千四百元計算）。至登記檢騐發照部份。牌照有關成本，且須費種種行政手續，擬定徴收牌照費七千五百元，登記費一千五百元，檢騐費一千五百元，共一萬另五百元。至核發車主憑證及收取保證金，以辦理不及，將延至二十六年四月一日起，在該項車輛換照時，一併辦理，藉减少此次征費數額。</p>
<p>此次淘汰之人力車？除車主僅有一輛者暫不淘汰外，共有一九四四輛。前往公用局申請改裝爲三輪車者，已有一九五五輛。足證車商對於人力車之必需淘汰，已有　遍之認識。</p>
<h3>徐學禹返滬談　台省航務　推進順利　台灣航業公司明正成立</h3>
<p>國營招商局總經理徐學禹爲視察該局台省業務情形，與參加台灣航業公司成立事，於上週六由滬赴台，業於前日午後公畢返滬。據談稱：本局爲發展航務，對於台灣日人所遺留而屬招商局名份下應得之倉庫，大都破壞不堪，且亦不適應用。故此行主要任務爲視察本局所有之倉庫，並設計予以改造，俾資應用。招商局除在台北設有分局外，於基隆等地，均設有辦事處，故對台省方面航務之推進，頗爲順利。至於合灣航業公司係合省行政長官公署所主持，已正式成立。現有船隻僅台北號與台南號兩艘，經常航行於合省各口岸。台航公司以招商同爲國營機構，特邀請合作。故招商局現爲台航公司股東之一。此外徐總經理曾與台省當局磋商關於增運煤斤及裝運台米等事。現台煤來滬者每月已有六萬噸，如運輸能暢通，則台煤運滬數量尙能繼續增加。又招商局爲節省開支，調整航運次序，已於最近擬定各綫班輪，下月起即可實施。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕台灣航業公司，昨已召開創立會，定於明年元旦正式成立，資本總額國幣一百億元，台省公署六成，招商局四成，由徐學禹擔任董事長，台署交通處長任顯羣兼任總經理，聞將開　台灣至上海·福州·厦門·汕頭·廣州·靑岛等地之定期航綫，幷將加强高雄至上海間之運輸，增加高雄倉庫及裝卸設備期，使高雄恢復繁榮。</p>

<p>岡部現年六十歲，日本廣島縣人，二十六年抗戰初起時任敵華北派遣軍參謀長，駐於天津。二十八年調爲駐蒙軍司令官，負責進攻張家口·山西，綏遠等地。二十九年回國任技術部長。卅三年調任華北方面司令官，去年日本投降時尙任第六方面軍司令官，坐鎭武漢，常年之長沙會戰，鄂北鄂南會戰，皆由該犯担任主要指揮，勝利後由我政府逮捕，於本年八月六日押進上海戰犯拘留所。</p>

<p>審訊將達三月之　粹戰犯案，日來進行至爲積極，雙方舌戰激烈，出庭作證之證人，已近二十餘人，現尙有十五日證人繼續出庭，爲廿一個希特勒信徒作有利之證人，此案之審訊期，約尙有兩星期，審畢，雙方律師辯論後，法庭即可宣判，無論渠等有罪與否審訊完畢後，如英方與我方不予審訊，或可由美軍解押回德國處理。記者昨走訪歐哈德案之檢査官杜亞爾少校，據稱：此二十七名納粹戰犯中，雖有六名被判無罪，但仍被關禁提籃獄內，其餘二十一名，仍在審訊中，美軍方面，希望能儘早完成此案，無論如何，聖誕節前可以結束，盟軍此次審訊戰犯，在法律上言，乃是予犯罪者以懲戒，但最主要之一點，乃使侵略者有所憬悟，並爲國際間樹立一種新法則，使後人有所準繩此可稱爲歷史上之第一次嘗試，　武主義者，應有所戒，杜亞爾少校審畢此案後，即赴東京，受麥克亞瑟元帥之聘，任麥帥之法律顧問，約在十二月底起程。鄂閩三省。至浙皖報中在手箱茶的八萬五千箱，平水佔四萬箱，屯綠兩萬箱，祁門則爲一萬餘箱。又悉：政府常局對茶　問題，頗爲關懷，上次經濟部部長不雲五來滬，曾與央行林局長籌擬收購今年度茶葉辦法，平水區綠茶，經央行中農之折衝，由中信局收購，雙方洽價亦已接近，惜一度中止談判，由此可見中樞對於本年度外銷茶葉，已一致認爲應由政府收購，及時輸出，爭取海外市塲。惟各雀茶商，因所墊資金，多須負担黑市利息，遷延愈久，成本愈高，亟盼當局能於陽曆年底，實施旣定政策，收購各地箱茶，至評級評價等技術問題，自常由茶葉公會及各地代表協助辦理。</p>
<h3>年終賞金問題　勞資需要諒解</h3>
<p>近米有少數工廠職工，以年關將屆，多向資方請求發給年終賞金，記者特走訪社會局勞工處趙班斧處長，據稱：關於年終賞金乙節，係出於情，並不適於法，法規並無規定，但是項年終賞金，如廠方能發給，可便勞資協調，惟本年工商業大不景氣，亦屬事實，總之，是項年終賞金問題，需要勞資雙方諒解。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　醫藥衛生</h3>
<p>（一）血吸蟲症</p>
<p>浦德間友人某君騐血發現嗜酸性細胞增加，據云此恐是日本住血吸蟲寄生身體所致，茲有疑問數則，希於貴報醫藥顧問欄內答覆爲感：（一）嗜酸性細胞增加能否斷定確有住血吸蟲在體內寄生？其他病症亦能使　酸性細胞增加否？（二）用何法能斷定確係患血吸蟲病？（三）此症之潛伏期有多少時候？潛伏期內有何現象？（四）此症如不醫治將生何種後果？（五）血吸蟲如何能進入人體？（六）如確知患有此症，信誼　廠」　　賜銻新有效否？無此病之人，可否注射？</p>
<p>〔醫藥博士顧毓琦答〕（一）嗜酸性細胞增加，於白血球分類中不一定即是有日本住血吸蟲在體內，根據病理學，凡嗜酸性細胞增加者，有下列疾病之可能：如腸中有各種寄生蟲，（蛔蟲等）氣管支氣喘症，瘧疾，及日本住血吸蟲等，（二）用檢騐大便及詳問病歷，再詳細檢査全身；（三）此症之潛伏期甚、長。人體感染本蟲二三星期後，即覺倦怠，食慾異常，微熱，有時即可發見肝臟，脾臟之腫太。感染後第四五星期母蟲開始產卵之時，初微熱而忽以惡寒而高熱，或弛張性，或間歇性，偶有稽留數日乃至十數日者。如此經過數日乃發生特異之裏急後重及粘液便，便中含有多數卵子，故檢　　便即可見許多蟲卵；（四）此症如不醫治則肝臟發生硬變症，腸粘膜陷於萎縮及壞死，且門脈系有鬱血，消化障礙，並起腹水及鬱血性之脾腫，終以營養不良或腹水過甚，旋至全身衰弱而死；（五）血吸蟲之傳染係由經皮膚，毫不經口，如人體或哺乳動物之皮膚，與血吸蟲之中間宿主，（係一種小螺）發育爲Cercaria接觸稍久即爲所侵入，而致感染；（六）如確知患有此症，可用Neostibosau，無此病之人則不應注射。</p>
<p>（二）鼻腔出血</p>
<p>黄雄問　鄙人自幼即患鼻出血症，時發時愈，有待出血甚多，經寒住後，復從口中吐出，日前經Ｘ光透視，云肺部正常，僅氣管稍有病狀，請問（一）此病起因何在？如何治療？（二）肺部正常，但有少量之痰（不咳），何故？何法診治？（三）鄙人患有砂眼，宜用何法診治？（四）包皮過長，有何害處？應如何治療？</p>
<p>〔醫學博士顧毓琦答〕（一）左鼻出血恐係慢性鼻膜炎或維太命西缺乏，宜詳細檢査後，方可決定，（二）肺部是否有病，可用Ｘ光拍照診斷之，茍無肺病而有痰恐係慢性氣管支炎症，（三）有無砂眼，宜請眼科專家診斷之；（四）包皮過長，易於遺精，施行手術各市立醫院均可治療。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕食油連日下跌，昨日囤戶更大批出舱，拋出生，菜，蔴各檔食油，共約二千担之譜，市價遂吿一蹶不振。生油爲十三萬五千元，豆油十三萬元，跌人議價甚鉅。聯配處之食油，竟之人問津。各榨油廠以生產量日有進境，而去路日　，存貨日多，不唯呆擱資金，且耗費折息。當於昨日下午二時，在油廠公會召開會議，共商應付辦法。常推大有餘謝裕祥，爲民薛成章，聯配處張超三人，赴社會局進　糧食科長吉明齊，提供意見：望社局准各油廠在議價之下，隨市伸縮配價。俾免市價較議價低廉時，議價配油即無去路。社局對各廠自願按市價貶低食油配價一事，殊表欣慰，常予批准。該項辦法，今日起即可實行。故預料今日食油配價，當可較　價减低。</p>
<p>又聯配處登記之一千四百餘家零售商，昨已全部發配齊全。今起第二次開始發配。自下週一起，該處將按各零售店之門市實銷額配售，以符實際情形。又聞吳市長日前出巡江　時，曾抽査食油零售店數家。對若輩平配食汕之來源，價格，及門售價格，査詢備詳。結果認爲該處辦理配油手續，悉能按照規定辦理，頗著成績云。</p>
<h3>美鈔又到四千九　黃金穿出二七〇萬</h3>
<p>烚赤昨仍有回升，蓋由供源不暢，而實銷仍殷有以致之，晨開爲二六五萬八，迫有銀根者有售出，買氣較衰，價步降。十時後央行以二六四萬之價，配給五〇條，此後逢低需求增加，自二六四萬內逐步回升，買風又起，供給見滅，近午曾回升至二六八萬五左右，始稍見平，午刻在二六八萬光景盤旋，午後隔日交割者有買無賣，穿出二七〇萬大關，而以高價結束，較前收漲四萬八，飾金掛高至念八萬四，紋銀銀元均平，暗拆仍在一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣昨稍形活躍，美鈔門市仍以三五〇〇元至三五三〇元爲賣買價，暗市中晨開爲四七五〇元至四八〇〇元，中途回升至四八五〇元以上，午刻微回，午後經金市哄高後，亦被動扳高至四九〇〇元結束，較前收漲起百餘元，港票以成交有限，尙形平穩，港匯自九三〇元升至九四〇元有買，印匯一一四〇元左右，英滙一五一〇〇元有供，成交有限，美滙仍無變動。</p>
<h3>米價微漲　豆油回小一二千</h3>
<p>昨南北米市到源共一萬餘石，店方零星去路較殷，南粳軋升千餘元，北粳亦漲千元，秈米頗俏俐，白陰元到消兩淡，仍少軒　，黄豆去路淸懈，仍在疲中盤旋，續見回小三五百元，豆餅客消平常，價格平庸，麵粉暫定。麵粉消路呆滯，缸豆如前，芝蔴廣帮續進，市面頗香，生仁本街揀巧拾取，高定次呆，蠶豆略升二三百元，菉豆南洋續辦，市勢平正，苞米穩定，油市供求尙穩，豆油回小一二千元，生油平平，淸油亦　，菜蔴油平平，漢口蚌埠東北續有來貨，油價暫趨和平之勢。</p>
<h3>北非需要華茶　匯率未定頗受阻碍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」茲據茶葉界對記者談稱，歐美人士，對於日常生活必需品之茶葉，頗爲重視，而尤以法屬菲洲一帶，其重要性，幾若我人之於米糧，且歷年均仗我國供給，但戰事結束後，在種種原因下，交易未能復活，其最主要原因，厥爲匯率尙未正式規定，例如最近彼地擬以鉅額法郞電匯太市各行，惟受上述關係，一時竟無受主，依現狀觀察，際此華茶危機日趨深刻之時，甚盼政府予以及時之解決也。</p>
<p>洋莊茶市，昨賣戶吐售仍殷，而目前國外對於華茶雖尙需求，惜給價苛刻，因此出口商無意暢收，交易仍任弱，紅綠茶內銷更無起色，過程靜中帶秋。</p>
<h3>日印紗到港　價較滬市爲廉</h3>
<p>〔香港廿九日電〕日本麥帥總部核准輸出之日紗五百萬磅，昨已有一部份運抵港，印度棉紗亦有大批運到。據悉：印棉紗，將向華南傾銷定價遠較滬市爲廉，並有輸往南洋各埠趨勢。</p>
<h3>存棉不足三月者　將准予結匯購買　明年全國廠用棉達九百萬担</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據紡織專家估計：我國紗錠之運轉數。目前約僅二百五十萬錠，明年度起以東北紗錠。漸可修復開工，可望陸續增加至三百萬或三百五十萬錠。普通紡製粗紗，每錠年須原棉三担至三担半，細紗錠約須二担半。以平均每錠三担計，以全國紗錠三百萬枚爲標準，估計明年我國紡紗所需之原棉約爲九百萬担。然實際上各廠紗錠不能終年終日運轉，且各廠常有停工，或缺少動力之事發生，故該項用棉量，尙須打以相當折扣。現聞當局，對各廠存棉量不敷三月之需者，將准予結匯購買美棉。同時，須按一定比例，搭　國棉，以資提倡。惟六區紗廠公會自辦理會員各廠存棉登記以來，迄僅七十餘家報到，尙望未報到各廠，從速塡報，以利進行云。</p>
<h3>龍頭布近十萬</h3>
<p>布市各地客銷仍旺，蓋以紡建開售有限，塲上籌碼緊縮，各檔布疋復創高價，龍頭細布將叩十萬大關。以染織廠對深色各布，咸望俏挺，不願脫手，深色士林再升三千元，細布及四君子嗶嘰亦漲二千元至二千五百元，金鎊樂安安藍布突漲一萬有奇，現貨枯涸，各貨一致挺進。</p>
<h3>英國紡紗業　現在之產量</h3>
<p>路透社倫敦廿八日電〕蘭開夏州每年須產紗十八億二千萬磅，方能配合全國經濟計劃，並達到一九三于八年輸出額增加百分之七十五之目標。自本年四月至八月之五個月時期中，生產量爲每年七萬三千萬磅，除國內需要七萬萬磅外，尙餘三千萬磅，供出口之需。該業自信能彌補此項不足之數，惟各種阻碍，如年代久遠之機器，不經濟之工作，原料缺乏等，必須設法克復。</p>
<h3>對蘇貿易難發展　由蘇方出價太低</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中蘇貿易：刻尙在逐步推展中。聞最大之困難，厥唯蘇聯出價太低。例如我國之茶磚，蘇聯駐華商務代表，曾數度接洽裝運。終以開價太低，而無法成交。至年來我國輸出於　聯之桐油，生絲，猪鬃等貨物，　係爲抵償我國過去對蘇聯之負債。該項工作，本係復興公司承辦。民廿八年起，改由中央信託局承辦。每年陸續以價値約美金一千一百除萬元之貴物運蘇，以　　欠。預計至民國四十一年，始可全部拔淸云。</p>
<h3>茶葉五千箱　昨日裝往歐洲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大批茶葉運歐，法國郵船公司第一艘復航來滬之松旦號。昨日離滬返法，運歐茶葉有五千餘箱，爲勝利後中歐綫輸出茶葉數量新紀錄，惟較戰前尚屬微乎其微。又海甬輪作駛津，有棉花二千一百五十包，運往天津，係中紡公司報裝，另有藥品一百噸，係北平協和醫院之貨，運津轉平。</p>
<h3>麵粉生產過剩　配售量銷不足數　廠商申請收買或准出口</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市阜豐，福新，華鷹，裕通，茂新等五大麵粉廠，自恢復開車產粉以來，每日經常提供麵粉一萬二千袋，依照議價配售。惟近來以粉價平疲，配售之麵粉，日僅領去數千袋。然五廠之正常生產量，每日約爲八萬袋。如專爲生產配售之粉，每月開車五日，即足敷全市配售一月之需。然按目前情勢言，僅此五日之產量，尙且無法配盡。故額外之生產量，遂更無去路。各廠咸感　資金呆擱，折息徒耗。結果，只得出於停工之一途。然工人之薪津，仍係按月計算。現聞各廠正向市府申請，將各廠　餘之麵粉，設法交由糧部收買，或則轉口，以及其他合理辦法處置之，以蘇粉廠之困苦云。</p>
<h3>本外埠申請人絲　中信一律照配</h3>

<h3>四二支紗到五百廿萬　下月配紗期已經排定　繳款期限由各廠與複配會決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市益見高漲，內地客帮，在渴求現貨中，不惜重價搜買，執貨者不肯貿然賣出，必須待價血沾，是以廿支紗續升四五萬，細紗尤爲挺秀，卅二支銀月雖出三百零五萬，藍鳳曾高至三百廿五萬，亦不易多得，四十二支警綫又昂至五百念萬，然已成强弩之末，買戶稀少，頗有知難而退之　矣。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市國民營各廠十二月份聯合配銷之棉紗，自經決定仍分四次配售後，茲悉：四次之日期，已定爲二日，九日，十七日，廿五日。至每次繳款之期限，將由配銷棉紗各廠與複配會合紐之擴大配銷會決定。複配會各廠爲繳款後仍未能領到配紗，則可按日扣息。又另售商之配紗一千五百件，亦將照上述日期，分四次配售云。</p>
<h3>囤戶抬高絲價　中蠶拋出七十担</h3>
<p>沉寂已久之絲市，本週間忽突飛孟晋，自週一起廿分二條紋Ｄ級生絲，每担由三百四十萬元，繳升至四百萬元關外，但國外市况，則頻趨下跌，如此畸形市勢，顯係執戶故意高抬，緣絲織業貸款，正値開始貸放之際，而各絲織廠所存原料不充，故各廠商請得貸款後，必須大事吸收供用，致一般生絲執戶，認爲有機可乘，籍以抬高售價，前日由蠶公司代中信局收購，Ｄ級廿分廿二條紋生絲。轉售各綢廠七十担，價爲國幣三百九十五萬元，自此批拋售後，一般執戶漸見歛跡。昨日已漸回平，Ｄ級生絲每担開價三百八十萬元。本市誠豐絲織廠向永泰絲廠訂購特種粗條紋生絲四十分四十二條紋Ｄ級生絲十五担，價爲國幣四百〇五萬元。</p>
<h3>卅餘件貸款　經四聯核准</h3>

<h3>工業原料　須防到貨湧至</h3>
<p>原料市塲，恍同投機景象，存底較薄之原料，一遇有人問津，即　起扒吸，三酸（硫酸，鹽酸，硝酸）價漲二三倍，小蘇打，純碱亦漲勢頗勁，石炭酸，一月以前價爲每磅三百餘元，後雖漸漸上漲，至多亦不過五六百元，現突漲至四千四百元一磅，鋅粉前以市貨充斥，貶價銷售，近日亦貨缺價昂。凡上漲之貨，雖出高價，無處搜購，因之頻於垂危之原料行商，頓呈活潑，但據業中人云：本年三月間，美貨原料，大批進口後，原料價格，已呆定迄今。預計十二月份外輪到齊，進口原料，較三月間爲多，故原料商之厚利，未必可持久云。</p>
<h3>銀行帮套息　證劵呈盤旋之狀</h3>
<p>公價昨略回降，統丙晨開一四二〇元。業中大戶若誠德等鑒於證券帮環境不利，有所拋售而跌至一三一○元以下，始轉平穩，最後在一三五〇元以上掙扎，良以雜牌仍由六〇四室收買，尙現平定也，紡果較前收計甲乙丙各跌八十元，統丁小七十元，統戊挫五十元，成交約五百萬元。</p>
<p>華股昨低後回升，銀行帮實行套利，現交方面之供給。有大量銀行資金吸收，空方無法活動，近午爭補有以致之，晨開平穩，開後空方尙圖一逞，先向現交施壓，八九號三六號有售，而見新低價，經二〇七號從事套利，始獲維持，四號一七六號二三一號一四二號三八號等陸續抵補，逐步拉高，十時半左右，現貨方面不斷力壓，二二九號一五二號一六九號有售，復現怯疲：此際現　相差達十元，新業交通實行低利套息。是以現貨壓力，有人掃數吸收，人心漸穩，盤旋而升，二三二號一七七號一〇九號等買進，一八〇號八九號一四九號補空步殷，盤旋而升，近午更爲堅定，結果較前收熱股永紗信和新光各升半成，景福勤興華豐微升，美亞漲一成光景，冷股中紡榮　統益中絲五和均跌落少許，餘者升起半成光景，遞交永紗美亞勤興各升半成，信和好半成强，景福平，新光華豐微升，午後新買忽寂，一起　風，維持吿乏，賣戶雖少，人心尙惑不定，廣帮若一八四號有售，易於下瀉，但低價時經一七三號等略納，尙易支持，臨收稍問，結果較前收計永紗新光微升，美亞信和華豐各升半成弱，景福平，勤與微挫，冷股永公升一成弱，水泥跌一成，餘者升降互見，遞交永紗美亞信和華豐微升，景福平，新光勤興微降。塲外各股稍有　升。</p>

<h3>記聯合國大會代表廿餘人演講風度</h3>
<p>— 卅一日紐約航訊　本報駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>二十年前，一位政治學者曾經說過：外交是一種藝術，不是科學。一個成功的外交官，並非靠書本上的公式，而是憑一時的機智，以及對應的天才。在這次聯合國大會中，我聽了二十多位首席代表的演說。最成功的，我認爲是印度代表潘笛德夫人</p>
<p>潘笛德夫人　講詞最成功</p>
<p>舊金山會議的時候。潘笛德夫人還沒有當代表的資格，她是以印度人民身份，在美國上下作政治活動，以爭取印度的自由與獨立。如今印度自治初步吿成了，這位尼赫魯主席的妹妹，穿着水紅色的印度女裝，受着聯合國一致的擁戴。</p>
<p>潘笛德夫人有着一副「飽經風霜』的臉相，花白的頭髮，中等身段。她的英文，每一個音節都非常淸楚，雖然有一點印度土音夾雜其間，但是並不令人聽了厭試。她照着預備好的演說稿念下去，每一段的最後一句，收音非常輕鬆而短促。這和美國代表奧斯汀的正完全相反。奧斯汀講話像演戲，聲音很鏗鏘，每一段的結語，聲音很宏亮，常常以宏亮的口音，博得會塲的掌聲。</p>
<p>奧斯汀演說　似風捲落葉</p>
<p>據說，杜魯門總統所以選奧斯汀出任首席代表，原因就在於他能『說話』，他是國會上院中最有煽動性的一個。他講話的抑揚頓挫，非常分明。他念演說稿，有時候像風捲落葉，一口氣念上十多句。有時候，一個字，一個字，要相隔十多秒鐘，他的聲音有如洪鐘，不像員爾納斯那樣滿口『沙聲』，也不像社魯門那樣聲調軟弱。許多美國聽衆，對奧斯汀的過份『戲劇性』，引起反感，但是，大部份的美國人，還是覺得他的演講够『過癮』。</p>
<p>倍格爾爵士　具紳士風度</p>
<p>十足紳士風度的英國代表，也有令人可愛之處，他們開會認眞每會必到。每到必從頭到尾傾耳細聽。首席代表貝文外相沒有來，代表英國演話的，仍然是倍格爾爵士，他的風度，和一月間在倫敦開會時一樣。他念演講稿，內容指責蘇聯，但是，他的臉孔，老不向蘇聯這邊看。這次大會的席次。英美蘇都在第一排，英美在左邊比鄰而座。蘇聯在第一排的中間靠右，蘇聯席次的左側是烏拉圭，右側是委內瑞拉。</p>
<p>每一代表講完話下台的時候，都要從英美代表席面前走過。倍格爾爵士，向例都站起來熱忱的握手，以慶祝對方演講成功的意思，（祗有莫洛托夫除外）。倍格爾和潘笛德夫人熱烈握手，和顧維鈞博士拉手的時候，有難於形容的親切之感。</p>
<p>顧維鈞博士　言動均得體</p>
<p>就演講的技巧與風度而言：我覺得顧少川博士這一次（十月二十八日）的演講，眞是百分之百的成功。他腰幹挺直，走路，動作，兩隻手的支配，都非常得體。英文發音，婉轉而淸晰，每一句，每一個字，都能够達意。尤其可取的是：別國代表都從頭到尾按着稿子念讀，臉孔都不向着聽衆。顧少川雖也看稿子讀，但他却背熟了第一段和最後一段，開頭和結尾，是演講成功的關鍵，這無論如何，是幾十年來經騐的結晶。</p>
<p>但是，中國代表的演講，在這次整個大會中，我們是沒有地位的。爲什麼？我們講的沒有內容。除了歌誦一篇『和平八股』以外，中國今天的內外情勢，簡直無從講一句具體的話。記得今年一月間，倫敦舉行第一次聯合國大會的時候，倫敦泰晤士報的記者描寫說：「顧維鈞博士口才玲琍，但內容言之無物」。道一次，我們仍然是犯着同一毛病。莫洛託夫的演講，奧斯汀的演講，紐約時報，和先鋒論壇報，都用整頁篇幅刋載全文，白俄羅斯，墨西哥的演講，也刊載了相當詳細的綱要，但是，顧少川的演講，紐約時報只用兩句話，把它輕輕描寫了過去。紐約前鋒論壇報：『接着，中國代表演講，內容無特殊可記，惟有一點倒十分有趣，那便是顧維鈞博士重申國際管制尼古丁』。（按即鴉片紅丸中之尼古丁，麻醉品之一種）。</p>
<p>南代表發言　聽衆打瞌盹</p>
<p>和顧維鈞的格調正相反的是：南斯拉夫首席代表薛密樞，這位老態龍鍾的老頭子，穿一身黑禮服，站在合上念讀他的法文稿子，足足一點多鐘。樓上棋下的代表，記者與聽衆，都幾乎打了瞌睡。南美洲的許多小國家，像危地馬拉，尼阿瓜拉等等，一向對開會不感興趣，這時候早已溜之大吉。像羅斯福夫人之流，拿着報紙看報，（顧維鈞演講的時候，羅斯福夫人兩手翻閱紐約郵報）。許多記者老爺們，對南斯拉夫這位老頭子不感興趣，談天的也有，下棋的也有，畫井字的也有，我因爲和一位美國記者畫并字，打翻了記者席上的椅子，全塲爲之注目。</p>
<p>然而，這樣一個老頭子，道樣像和尙唸經一樣的演講，它的內容，正是非常尖銳與刻薄，他的聯合國大會記者更幽默，他說痛斥英國在希臘的行爲，主張保留否決權，還章涉到美軍駐留中國的話，這些，都等到翻譯官用英文傳譯的時候，大家方深深領悟到。</p>
<p>紐西蘭代表　貌似胡適之</p>
<p>比南斯拉夫代表更長的演講，是紐西蘭的老外交家白蘭德聖，講了十九頁的演說稿，他講話充份的一副學者風度，樣子也有些像胡適之。這位紐西蘭的代表，從盤古氏開天闢地講起，一樁椿，一件件，然後分析到和平的重要，以及五强『否泱權』之不合理。他是主張廢除『否決權』的。</p>
<p>否決權問題，想不到這次竟成了大會的中心題材。再其次，是外國軍隊居留非敵國領土問題，再其次是猶太和巴勒斯坦問題。這三大問題之中，前兩個是赤裸裸的，後一個則是若隱若現的。前兩個問題，可以大聲咆哮，漲紅了臉駡人。後一個問題，大家都不願明提，都用『絃外之音』來表達。前兩個問題，陣綫的對立，形勢簡單。後一個問題，不但關係複雜，而且馬上會影響十一月五日美國的選舉。</p>
<p>首先揭發猶太問題的，是杜魯門的開幕致詞。他說到不論任何種族，凡無家可歸者，聯合國應遣送其返回家園。他還說：『余將盡力使國會通過法案，以准許此種人移入美國』。這是杜魯門爲十一月五日民主黨爭取選舉票的話，對內的作用，重於對外，後來，埃及，伊朗，黎巴嫩的回敎國家代表講話，都一再提到關於遣送『無家可歸』人士回籍的問題。埃及代表講得很明顯，他說：「遣送無家可歸者回籍，應以不引起糾紛爲原則，尤其不該損害原來居住人民的利益」。彼此都沒有提到『猶太人』一字，但肚子裏早就『心照不宣』。</p>
<p>埃及兩人材　不提猶太事</p>
<p>埃及出席大會的首席代表，是海蓋爵士，埃及上議院的議長，秃頂，帶闊邊玳　眼鏡，他說一　　好的法國話，他和埃及駐美大使海森爵士是埃及兩大人材，海森爵士說的一口流利的英語，是出席安全理事會的埃及代表。據埃及代表團的內部人員說，他們不希望大會討論猶太問題，如果萬一有人提出，埃及將拚死力爭，反對分化巴勒士坦，尤其反對杜魯門的片面支持猶太人政策。</p>
<p>三十年來的美國大總統，沒有一個不向猶太人送媚眼的。猶太人控制了美國的商業，尤其控制了美國的宣傳機構。希特勒尙且終於給猶太人絞殺了，更何况一個民主國家的行政首長？</p>

<h3>東台　范公堤上一古城　重投入政府懷抱</h3>
<p>— 十三日東台訊　本報泰縣記者凌松壽</p>
<p>東台收復了，這范公堤上的古城的重新投入政府懷抱，帶給人們無限的興奮，但也帶給人們無限的感慨！</p>
<p>記者在蘇北每天　電稿，寫文章；從勝利到現在一年多了，差不多總是一些「戰爭」，「傷亡」…等等可怕的字眼；或者是：「還鄉」，「救濟」…等等可憐的呼聲！</p>
<p>廿五日，國軍開始準備對東台作戰的部署，五十六團搜索前進，在冲家舍李家舍一帶遭遇共軍的蘇中軍區特務團和蘇二分區第五團的堅强抵抗，戰事斷續起伏。五十七團由胡家墩前進，在東台外圍的量後一個據點！五神廟附近，因共軍工事堅固，激戰竟日。</p>
<p>廿六日，戰事繼續進行黄昏後，一八九團攻克三灶，進迫東台東門，五十六團又將柬台東南方各據點共軍肅淸，距城不足二華里。五神廟方面，則仍在膠着中</p>
<p>廿七日，這收復東台的偉大塲面於清晨幾個鐘點內急轉直下。五十七團正面與五神廟共軍對峙，另以一部是迴攻克西溪—五神廟後路。五神廟的共軍後方截　，紛紛潰退，五十七團乃續向東台城郊突擊。沿城西南方之丁公橋海道橋突入市區，與由城南民生工廠突入之五十六團會師，時爲淸晨八時。過了一刻，一八九團也由西門進城，並向四郊戰塲的殘餘共軍展開肅淸工作。</p>
<p>至是，十三日到廿七日，整半個月的軍事行動，圓滿而迅速地完成任務。</p>
<p>這一戰事，在國軍方面，是帶着一點「賭氣性」的。七月中旬，十九旅在泰興，宣家堡受共軍偷襲，經數晝夜之苦戰，國軍始終沒有放棄據點，在很短的時間內予以還擊；而其戰果，共軍的棄屍比國軍的傷亡要多出五倍以上。就戰事本身說，國軍可算是完全發揮了軍人的精神而獲致勝利。可是共軍爲了掩護他們的敗績起見，竟大言不慚的在新華日報上發表：十九旅傷亡的兩萬人以上，已經全部殲滅。其實，國軍的損失不過三千多人。</p>
<p>「國軍是不善說話的！虛偽的宣傳，自有事實來戮穿牠。我們總得有這樣的一個機會，吿訴共產黨：十九旅是不是眞的打垮了？」記者很淸楚地記得這是李師長和十九旅楊旅長緊張地揮着拳頭，對記者說的一段話。</p>
<h3>大時代的小波瀾　給予共軍以巨大的教訓</h3>
<p>這一個機會終於來到了。李師長把進駐東台的住務，差不多全都交給十九旅的兩個團—就是以前防守泰興的五十六團和防守宣家堡的五十七團。</p>
<p>他又繼續吿訴記者關於他們部隊作戰的作風：</p>
<p>我們作戰的作風，純粹是一種競賽式的，當十月十四日，本旅由陸路北上的五十六團收復實家集後，由水路推進的五十七團的弟兄們，便磨拳擦掌地要有所表現。所以廿一日關始行動後，廿二日便一鼓攻克時埝。攻時埝是用的第一二兩營，第三營當時埝收復後，便爭着向東北追擊，一口氣進抵伍家埠。我們不但團與團，營與營是如此，就是連與連，排與排也都是這樣地存着競賽的心。十九旅每一個士兵的心裏，都這樣地想着：如何地才能保持我們抗戰期閒的榮譽，而不辱沒了那全國部隊中以我們得到最多的三張「武功狀』。</p>
<p>最後，他又對記者說：「東台的收復與其說是軍事上的勝利，毋寗說是政治上的成功，這有兩點可以證明：第一，國軍到處，當地民衆，常常在運輸上，情報上，或其他方面予以許多的協助。尤其有一次，河中横豆一條土壩，我們的汽艇不能通過。鄉村中人，不分老少，自動地集合了數十人，不顧天氣冷和衣服濕，跳下河去，幫着我們挖壩，使汽艇很快地通過。第二是共軍內部的不安。這次携械投誠的共軍比我們俘獲的共軍要多。他們一見了國軍就哭了，他們反戰的情緒很高，而所供給我們的共方情報也很確實。」楊旅長光着頭，架着一副眼鏡，很像一位學者（其實他的確是一位能詩善寫的戎馬書生），他愈說愈高興。</p>
<p>東台收復，在一個大時代的狂濤洶湧中，是一個微小的波瀾，或許不會留一個太深的痕跡於歷史巨輪的行程中；可是在目前，他將給予共軍很大的敎訓—</p>
<p>第一，國軍是打不敗的，虛僞的宣傳，徒然引起明眼者的冷笑</p>
<p>第二，民衆的力量是無窮的。誰使他們家破人亡，流離失所，誰就是他們的敵人，他們爲了生存，爲了安居樂業，他們將自動地發揮出力量來，不惜任何犧牲，奮鬥到底。</p>
<p>第三，共軍的「幹部」現在已逐漸地覺悟，一個人總有良心。欺騙的技倆，祇能蒙蔽於一時，有這一天，他們的天良發現的時候，他們將要想：「我們爲什麼要自相殘殺，引起戰爭；我們爲什麽要屠殺百姓，喪盡天良？』到這時，恐怕也就是共軍瓦解的時睽了。</p>

<h3>山與水——「西部傳奇」外編之一——</h3>
<p>— 楊邨人</p>
<p>語云「桂林山水甲天下」，實則桂林之山。如獨秀峯僅以秀勝，而「陽朔山水甲桂林」云云，則以奇勝而已。十九年冬入蜀，由水道，船經巫峽，仰望神女諸峯，浮於雲端。鞏嵐如畫，亦得秀名。去年秋入處川邊，沿泯江上游行，過龍溪，便見高峯立，如V字形，行二日，山又如W字形，峯迴路轉，形勢萬變，而疊溪沉後，觀音岩一帶羊腸小道，峻峭壁立，空氣頹薄，沙石時飛，得險名。今年春出松潘，過大雪嶺，風冷如刺，雪下如霰，如入北極地界，右山勢平易，積雪經年不消，左山麟麟，岩峯嵩立，雖不能積雪，而色如銀，雪花飄飛中，陽光照岩石上，時呈五彩色，峯已奇，色更奇，宇宙秘密，漢觀止了。</p>
<p>海水鹽，河水黃，多見不異，疊溪海子的水碧緣如油，從海底流，水面靜止無波紋，一奇；兩河口山上俯視三江，一流黃色，一流緣色，一流黑色如墨，二奇；輕鎭江關値天雨，泯江流急，其混濁如奈何橋下的惡水，聲勢顏色，足以奪魄，三奇。</p>
<h3>草地　——「西部傳奇」外編之二——</h3>
<p>— 楊邨人</p>
<p>相傳當年某黨「二萬八千里長征」，奔走西南各省，經川邊草地才到陕西，對於川邊草地形容得險如地獄，十分動人。我到松潘以後，對於草地這地方憧憬着懷念着，决心是走一趙。調查的結果，草地並非水澤池沼，而是川邊的大高原，河流雖然交錯，邱陵却到處密佈，藏民以草地爲游牧地帶，馬牛羊爲他們的財產，帳蓬爲他們的屋子，有喇嘛廟的地方才有房舍，而房舍亦是和尙的廟宇。從松潘黃勝關出草地，經包座，上俄羅，而入青海，共三十個馬站，馬行一月才出四川境。</p>
<p>黃河發源於街海，流入四川境後再至靑海。四川面積之大已可驚人，黄河流入四川境爲地理敎科書所未載，又奇。黄河結冰，以牛毛口袋盛河冰，行一日如不易兩口袋即漲破口袋，這河冰運至松潘稱爲靑鹽，黄河的水是鹹的可變成食鹽更奇。今年春，我策馬馳出黃勝關，仍沿泯江上游行，至三里　國立松潘職業學校講演，問草地還有多少遠，說是過去的地方就率稱草地了，流水，邱陵，樹林，草壩子，都和三里壩一樣，無須去君，使我掃了興。</p>
<h3>關於音樂用語的翻譯</h3>
<p>— 李馳</p>
<p>沒有動筆寫關於音樂的文章，怕有四五年了吧！一切音樂書籍，樂譜唱片都在戰爭中散失光，一切音樂書籍，樂譜唱片都在戰爭中散失光，經過這幾次流亡逃難，也沒有昔日那種心情了。三年前在桂林，看到一冊「新出版」的「音樂辭典」，而材料卻是十五至二十年前「良友」版的改竄入，我隨手一翻，不禁驚異那位編者有「起死回生」的「法力」，把四分之一世紀以來逝世了的音樂家全體「還魂」而且健在人間，但我當時也沒有勁來執筆。「有」不是總比「沒有」好嗎？那是戰時。</p>
<p>最近在「春秋」上先後看到朱理惺，張寗約瑟諸無生討論關於音樂家譯名的文章，不知怎的卻想搖搖筆桿了。但我先聲明：第一，我對音樂是我門外漢，「弄斧」無力，何況「班門」？我所希望倒不如說拋出破瓦，引回金剛鑽。第二，執筆時沒有任何參考材料在手，所以全篇都在「假如我記慰問電沒有鏎的話」這前提下寫出。我只希望提出問題；而問題的解決和定論，則企望於諸專家先進。</p>
<p>一·譯甚麼？</p>
<p>朱先生提出西洋音樂家人名的音譯，應該設法統一。這誰亦抱有同感。不過應厘訂應統一的似乎並不限於「樂藝上的譯音問題」（朱先生原題如此），作曲家名字的漢譯，不公平其中一項而已。</p>
<p>是「小提琴」抑「四絋琴」還是「懷娥鈐」呢？這不是和Beethoven的漢譯名同樣要弄個標準麼？</p>
<p>太平洋戰前在香港，我曾「不量力」的寫下個計劃，希望在若干年內把音樂用語和人名，按如下次序弄一個自己應用的漢譯表。但這工作「淺當即止」，因爲它超出了我的力量。</p>
<p>（一）音樂會節目單和名曲唱片上最常見的題名，作者名，曲式用語。</p>
<p>（二）管絃樂隊，軍樂隊中樂器名：和獨戰獨奏，合昌合奏中最常見的音樂用語。</p>
<p>（三）著名的演奏家，指揮者，樂隊，……的名字。</p>
<p>以上似乎是最急需的。第二　　了將以上擴充以外，起碼還想包括：</p>
<p>（四）音樂理論和音樂史上的特殊用語和「私有名詞」。</p>
<p>（五）管絋樂「總譜」（Score）上各種樂器的演奏特有記號和用語。</p>
<p>（六）「爵士」（Jazz）和「搖曳看樂」（Swing）用語。（我並沒有偈「學院派」那末歧視它。理由暫從略。）</p>
<p>（七）諸民樂音樂的音樂用語與「私有名詞」。</p>
<p>（八）其他……（如著名的音樂敎育家，考據家，評論家，著作家，樂器製作者，……等等）作曲者的人名如何漢譯，似乎僅佔不很大的比重。</p>
<p>二·難譯麼？</p>
<p>以上開列的名詞和名字，驃譯麼？難！一百個難！第一，難在原文的搜集選擇和厘訂，「字形」上發音上海個詞兒應以什麼爲基準。</p>
<p>第二，如何決定音譯抑意譯。</p>
<p>第三，尊重原有的漢譯抑或重新再譯。</p>
<p>第四，要絕對準確抑遷就簡便。其界經濟綫應若何。……還有其他。</p>
<p>難！試看看那些專家以畢生精力去考據一個作曲家的作品目錄的吧，再看日本「放送協會」以五年時間三十幾位（？）專家才厘訂了一冊不滿百頁的暫作標準的音樂語彙吧，這都可作爲旁證，我想，這種工作最好讓「國立編譯館」一類機關來做，一個人，充其量只能做極小部份。</p>
<p>外國語自然是一道障礙物。粗粗的數一下，恐怕光是做到上段第（一）項就要碰到十種以上的語文，甚至希伯來文，拉丁文，印度文，都用得着。談到曲名，那還遇到許多典故，傳說神話，私人掌故，……所以說，一百個難！但難也得做。</p>
<p>三·方塊字？</p>
<p>除了意譯以外，作爲音譯工具的方塊漢字該是個大問題。固然它有時可以帮助譯者取七偷賴，但更多的塲合，卻有如一把稱煤的老秤給化學家去當做定量分析天秤用！標準的方塊字讀音是北平語，但北平語的子音母音及其配搭，是中國現存諸種方言中最單純的一種。淸末的「詩韻」比起唐，宋的韻書，其韻目已大爲減少，而以北平語爲標準的「國音新詩韻」，刪去了「入聲」，韻目更爲拼減。（這似乎是語音歷史發展上一般的傾向。）以這一輛獨輪子「啦啦車」怎麼可以裝備成爲萬國水陸通用的交通工具呢？</p>
<p>我們只要在那一份以「聲」爲緯，以「韻」爲經的「國音常用字一覽表」上數一數，就曉得多少方格子空無一字，而剩下來有字的讀音，又少得如何可憐了。</p>
<p>少得不夠用是一個人問題，還有一點困難在於方塊字旣不是「拼音文字」，而且每字兼有字義。即使譯音是對了，「悲多憤」這種譯名，一千個用不得！</p>
<p>四·羅馬字？</p>
<p>所以我認爲，方塊字字比不上注音符號，而國語羅馬字又比注音符號用得清爽靈活。目前或許難以普遍應用，我仍然希望在音衆詞典或語彙這一類書刊中，對音譯的詞兒，附以國語羅馬字來做音標。最好再註以「國際音標」，不過這樣，已超出「音譯」的範團了。</p>
<p>相信「英語萬能」的人或許以爲只用廿六個字母就夠用了，其實，英語和方塊字之閩過是「五十步與百步」之差吧了！即使用那一套「人爲的」專門供給標音用的「國際音標」也吧，除了幾個寥寥可數的大民族語以外，記錄其他小民族語和地方語，也得補充五花八門林林總總的補助記號，才能交代。休說「英語萬痛能」！結果，這問題歸結到音譯的精密度上業。</p>
<p>五·原音麼？</p>
<p>譯音的「工具」（如方塊字或注意符號）解決了，考究原文的讀音也並不見得是件容易的事。在較大的民族語尙可翻查各該語音的詞典，再根擾他們本來的標準，像「官定外匯率」般來「換算」，但在弱小民族音樂，就者原文摻有「廢語」「僻語」……，就常常遇到困難了。又比方曲名或主歌詞中引用一個古代希臘福州的神名吧，那應該怎樣處置？照作曲所用的原文麼還是進一步追索「原如」的原音原文？</p>
<p>有許多人認唸的口音紀錄下來就成啦。不知道這是件天大的危險。每個美國人之並不見得都可以唸正Bach或Chopin的發音，是週知的事實。即使朱先生提起的Mozort這一個譯名吧，有敎養的奧國人在談話中唸起來，想也有不少的差別。因爲字典上「單字」標準音和在「句」中旣有不同，而且「語爲情變」更是不破的通則，這一點下文再說明。</p>
<p>總之，我以爲音衆用語，及與音樂有關的私有名詞的漢譯，厘訂而成標準，是件難卻急切需要的事，但「急」也得「準確」，「難」也得「幹」。不過說到「準確」，是有限度的，而用方塊字作音譯工具時其程度便低。正如上例提及，任何化學家也不能依靠一把老大秤而量出千分之一公分的微量來的。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　108</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>鶴見就着舞塲那種幽柔的燈光，向紙上一看，一邊也仲出一隻手來，把那不平的紙角壓住；只見那張像普通信封大小的一方紙，很淸晰的印着三張照片；一張是鶴見下飛機時的攝影，穿着行裝；一張就是鶴見這天晚上的紳士打扮；再有一張，就是一個近寫，單單只有面部的一部分，端底眉目如盡，神彩度奕奕，照片下面，排着四個大字，「問題人物」！別外幾行小字，註明鶴見的生辰年月·出身·資歷·現任·等等。</p>
<p>「大哥這可知道我並沒有亂造謠言！像這樣的字張，大概每個關係團體，關係人物手中，大概都有一張·大哥，你成了一個重要人物了；可也是衆矢之的哩！」萍了一邊說，一邊頑皮的笑着；一邊卻像表演魔術手法似的，絲毫不着痕跡，繳指一搖晃，依原樣把紙片折收起來；桌上單單勝下那張食品目錄，經她議手一再晃動，字片早已失蹤；萍子還故意淘氣地，把那紅潤如玉的手掌，向鶴見一撩，一翻動，一放；完全慕倣魔術家玩弄紙牌的動作</p>
<p>「承小姐這樣的關顧，感激是不用說的了……」鶴見也很湊趣，很敏捷地，把那張飲品目錄片，拈了起來，正巧湊着萍子還沒有收國手掌的一剎，端端正正的放在她攤開的手掌上。卻沒料到，萍子手掌一翻，把那張卡片，讓牠滑下，掉在桌上，一縮玉臂，合身向椅背一靠。那標準型的小嘴唇，早撅了起來：</p>
<p>「我呌萍子，姓中村，二十四歲，生在福島，難道還沒有調查清楚嗎？縱然不呌我萍妹——那是我最心契的支那詩意稱呼——也可以喊一聲萍子，或是柳詩……」她這時的神情，卻也眞有幾分詩意，也可入畫，畫題就是「如怨如慕」。</p>
<p>「她的，萍子，算我鳳降了！」鶴見滿臉生痛的笑了一笑。</p>
<p>萍子微微漢了一口氣，「大哥，你是不會投降的。投降的是我…不過我還有一句體已的話，你不討厭，我也午說，討厭，我他得說。我要奉勸；這次大哥回東京來，參加了這們可怕的一個秘密團體，不問不哥你的動機如何，最好早早離開東京，回部去工作也好，就是到支那內地去也好，因爲那都是比較一方面的事，不像這裏，是多方面的，而且一方面都難得討好。這是我內裏的一點小貢獻。」萍子簡直說明了東京地方的危險性，和她受命來監視的理由。</p>
<p>鶴見聽了這話，吸燃了那隻雪茄，稍稍出了一回神，沒有回答萍子的話；卻突地一伸手，把遠遠站着的一個招待員，損毀了來，在他耳邊輕輕說了兩句話，招待應聲去了。鶴見這才瞧着萍子說，「等音樂奏起『鹽色的多瑙』來，我要求你跳一次舞，不會遭到你的拒絕嗎？」</p>
<p>「我想沒有女子可以拒絕和你跳舞，我當然也不能例外。」萍子有些眉飛色舞起來，立刻吸了一口「勝利飯」。</p>

<h3>貧兒</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>一個人如果受過某種痛苦,等到他一旦有辦法時，立刻便盡力爲別人解除此種痛苦，這樣的人，在現社會裏實在難能可賣，値得讀頌的。</p>
<p>我知道上海有這麽一個人，他幼年貧苦，靠他母親替人家洗衣服來過活，他有志上進，在貧兒院裏苦讀，後來又進一　工廠半工半讀，從他的家到這　工廠有五里路，他每天早去晚歸，每親爲他所做的布鞋，他不忍穿着，走出家門，便脫掉了拿在手裏，赤脚往來跑十里路。當時，他立下一個志願，將來有能力時，一定多創辦貧兒小學，來救濟和自己有同樣遭遇這失學的痛苦的人。滿師畢業以後，他離開家鄉到上海來謀生，刻苦耐勞，從巡捕做起，後來又經營商業，不數年已很富裕，有財力可以實現他當時的志願了，於是他立刻便創辦了一所貧兒小學，不收取學生任何費用，獨力支持，最初他和他的太太還担任教職，數年來培養了不少年幼兒童，現在，在校兒童有兩百餘人。絃歌不輟，極著聲譽。</p>
<p>我其所以在這裏叙述這個故事者，固然是被感動，而覺得當前社會若能進步，像這一類的好人應該多起來、，越多越好。</p>
<p>受過飢餓痛苦的人，能盡他的力量使別人免於飢餓，受過寒冷痛苦的入，能盡力使他人免於寒冷，這個社會焉得不進步？自然，我們更願沒有苦痛經歷的人，也能這樣做；可是，「丟却敎化棒，志去討乞時」，這類人豈不正多？這類人如果讀到上面的故事，不該慚愧嗎？</p>
<p>二次大戰秘聞</p>
<h3>原子炸彈　險被納綷利用　２</h3>
<p>— 藍寗譯自十一月份「讀者文摘」</p>
<p>其時，諾斯克哈德羅廠爲了增產重水，正進行建築一座新水閘。愛諾由於他兄弟的介紹，在其中獲得了工作。用了無限的小心，他將最信任得過的朋友，組織了個可靠的小團體，由此探得了有關這工廠的種種情報。這些情報便拍發到倫敦的情報樞紐去。</p>
<p>據愛諾報吿，重水的產量在激增中；產品按月被運往德國。英國戰時內閣命令聯合作戰處，組織一個突擊隊，立時進襲諾斯克哈德羅。</p>
<p>聯合作戰處用了以往各戰役的全付經騐，担負起這最艱難的任務。克萊格山脈上空，變幻莫測地怒吼着狂暴的氣流，使挪威成爲歐洲方面降落傘或滑翔機最難侵襲的地區。但是靠着特朗斯達博士的帮助（他指導建造了那目標的正確模型並解釋它內部的情形），以及愛諾的確切的報吿，燕雀部隊（這是此次他們的秘密番號）終於紙織完成。</p>
<p>四個審愼拱選的挪威人，全是稱於滑雪的該處居民，將於事先降落到愛諾那裏去，準備在英國空運部隊進侵時接應。兩次，轟炸機帶着突擊隊到挪威上空，預備跳傘了，因雲層濃厚被迫退回。最後在一九四二年十月的一側晚上，他們終於川動了；幾小時後，　個人相繼躍入了沉沉夜色中。翌晨，他們發見身在羣山之間，離活動地點逾百哩。他們費了兩天時日方找到散落各處的配備。</p>
<p>燕雀</p>
<p>以後十五天中，「燕雀」隊作了次典型的雪地行軍。在四千呎高度，氣溫長期的在零下的情形下，一個人至多只能負荷六十磅的物件。這是說，要運載他的一百二十磅重的器具，每一個人得在同一條路上走三次。他們每天每人所得的配給，只有一小塊乳酪，一小捧麪粉和四塊餅乾。</p>
<p>十一月九日，聯合作戰處焦心等待着的長官收聽到了「燕雀」的密電碼。他們已到達諾斯克海德羅附近的地點，並已與愛諾接觸，準備就緒，擬用無綫電與燈號引導乘滑翔機去的破壞隊。</p>
<p>十一月十九日，兩架哈立法克斯式轟炸機從英倫出發，每架拖曳一架滿戰空運部隊的滑翔機。幾小時後，挪威的一個特務工作人員拍發無綫電報吿，竟說轟炸機與曳引機俱已失　撞毁，所有機中人員或死或被俘。</p>
<p>更糟的消息接菸到來。一個德國軍事情報員，搜索飛機殘骸時，找到一張地圖，見上面重水工廠所在地的佛莫克鎭，劃有紅綫爲記號。德國駐挪威的最高行政長官杜浦文和總司令法肯霍急忙親往佛莫克視察設防情形。納粹衝鋒隊在鄰近區域內搜査，逮捕了每一個稍有親英嫌疑的人。但他們並未捉到任何一個「燕雀」隊員。</p>
<p>艱苦</p>
<p>在倫敦，辛勤的聯合作戰處只有完全從頭開始。利用滑翔機進攻的計劃被放棄了。特種部隊的六個挪威隊員將用降落傘降落到那裏。特朋斯德應用地圖與模型訓練他們。時間愈來愈短。「燕雀」隊員少量的食物與無綫電機所用的電池俱將吿竭，勉强躱在四千呎高的山頂上一個白雪掩蔽的小屋裏，艱苦支持着。他們除了隊長，全都受着病痛的磨折。相隔若干哩的愛諾，正在躱避納粹特務的搜捕，然而每隔數天，他總還是在暮靄中滑雪而行，潛往佛莫克四近，與那些忠實的情報員會晤。</p>
<p>不久，愛諾無綫電報吿了倫敦一個幾乎不能置信的訊息，德國人由於某些原因，相信突擊隊員的目標不在諾斯克海德羅廠，而在於附近構築中的新水閘。一百個新衛兵已派往水閘，廠裏却只留下了十二名。</p>
<p>到十二月梢，「射擊手」部隊（這又是個秘密番號）準備出發。這六個挪威人在一個夜晚，降落於離「燕雀」隊員隱藏處之北面卅哩，遍蓋白雪的斯克萊根湖冰上。若十年間所未來的最狂暴的風雪掃過山野，使他們不能啓步，這些挪威人在一所荒屋裏旣凍且餓掙過了五天。等風雪已過，他們便繼續前進。當接近集合地時，他們突然見遠處有兩個滑雪者。假使這時碰到德國巡邏隊，事情就糟了。「射擊手」隊員中的一個，穿上了僞裝，戴上個平民的便帽，迎前去見那陌生人。假如是德國人，他便裝作是獵鹿者。其餘的人伏倒在雪中，手中緊握着槍。但是，接着，衝破緊密的風聲而來的，是三個大喜若狂的歡呼聲。「射擊手」與「燕雀」畢竟會合了。</p>
<p>原來如此</p>
<p>在芝加哥的一部電車中，我看見一個賣票員對乘客非常的客氣，這是少見的事，當乘客羣下去後，我就和他攀談了。</p>
<p>『啊，』他解釋着說，「在五年前，我在報紙上看到一個人在遺囑上把一筆款項贈送給一個他根本不甚熟悉的人，爲的是他的謙虛。「這也可能的，」我想，「這也許會發生到我頭上來，於是，我開始把乘客們像朋友般的對待着。後來，我覺得這樣的待人，於人於己，都很好，現在，我再也不去管是否人家會送給一百萬元錢，我還是繼續這樣的做下去！」</p>
<p>值多少錢</p>
<p>當我的妻子遺失了皮包的時候，我們不得不從火車上依舊跳下來。這時，一個脚夫氣也透不轉的奔過來，歸還那皮包。他拒絕了我們的謝金『假使你不嫌我冒昧的話，太太，我想知道你皮包中共有多少錢。』</p>
<p>我的妻吿訴了他，他拿出一本小簿子來，把數目加在一堆數字的下面。『我把數目記錄下來，預備將來計算，寳貴的誠實，究竟對我値多少錢。』他跡樣的解釋着。</p>

<h3>叫化子的組織　２</h3>
<p>— 黄家謨</p>
<p>丐幫之形成</p>
<p>老弟兄丐帮是無數小集團的個別組織，每個小集團須有一個「兜得轉」的「爺叔班子」爲首領，下面領率着「　三」七八人至二十餘人不等。其最主要的條件便需預先佔有一個大本營式的地點。然後可以在附近的地盤內培植勢力。因此這時食住問題已經解決，自然可以向外作「扒錢」的活動了。</p>
<p>「爺叔」輩所收領的童丐稱爲「小鬼」，此輩都是流落在街頭的貧兒浪意，多半是無家可歸者。一經收領，得到食宿的供應之後，便須一切唯命是聽，就連所扒到的錢也都得全數交帳。等到年事已長，能够自立時方始呌開。那時也可以自領小鬼，擠身於「爺叔班子」之列了。若是生性笨拙，年雖長而無獨當一面之才，未能取得爺叔地位者，其資格介於爺叔與小鬼之間，稱爲「連黨碼子」。此外還有一種中年落魄的無賴，在淪入丐流之先，未曾經過「小鬼」的階段者，此輩雖由爺叔勉予收容，可是在帮中究竟上下無依，帮中人稱爲「洋槍碼子」。「爺叔」與「爺叔」之間以「共扒弟兄」互稱。因爲同病相憐，平時頗注重於「放交情」。如有衝突事件發生，彼此間無法取得協調時，便須請出各地段有面子的「白相人」出來評理解決。再解決不了時，只好出於武力之一途了。</p>
<p>他們的大本營</p>
<p>每個丐帮小集團之成立，其先決間題，乃在是否擁有一個地盤。沒有地盤的老弟兄，有如衝上海魂一般，無安身之處，根本談不到爲小集團。在前淸，外帮丐流都有丐廠可住。惟老弟兄在他們眼中看來，還是一些不入流的丐流，殊無插足丐廠的權利。於是老弟兄不得不靠着自力向外發展了。</p>
<p>上海人烟稠密，里弄鱗比相接。每一里弄之中，前後總有空隙多餘之地，這是老弟兄們的新大陸。他們便呼朋引類，盤據爲歸宿地了。這種被佔據的地方，個中人統稱爲「桶子」。但因係屬露天的地盤，每値隆冬天雨，便須臨時搬家暫避。所以最理想的「桶子」，乃是在里弄內外的過街樓下的地方。因爲可以支架爲床，堆置棉被雜物。雖雨雪驟降，亦不足爲患。因此過街樓下實爲「桶子」中的金城玉闕，爲帮中弟兄必爭之地。</p>

<p>美人鈔票</p>
<p>報載昔日蜚聲國內的游泳健將美人魚楊秀瓊，近已下嫁川省聞人×××，聞條件爲結婚保證金二億元，另外新居設備費五億元。英雄美人，二難皆幷，洵令人艷羨不已，不渦這當中多標明了一筆七億元的「條件」，未免使佳話有點减色而已。據說此公在滬一夕豪賭，曾贏得七十億，所以用十分之一的博資，置得美人心，實在輕而易舉。寫到這裏，又聯想到福州最近曾有這麽一件事：福州市嚴市長，以明年度預算收支不敷六億元，建議抽收娼奴管理費來挹注，已爲市參議會通過，但被婦女團體得悉，大爲震怒，召開座談會，竭力反對，理由是：「女人不能當做商品」區區六億元之數，竟鬧得天翻地覆，什麼「人道主義」「婦女運動」等等大題目都搬出來了，其實眞是少見多怪。君不見這　廂連婚姻也講條件的，而且一講就是七億元，我們歌功頌德，心儀神往還來不及呢！更遑言「反對」　？美人萬歲！鈔票萬歲！</p>
<p>羊毛毯羊毛毯</p>
<p>據傳聞消息，早已登記竣事的公敎人員配售美軍毛毯一事，恐將成爲畫餅。因爲物資供應局方面已在宣稱「無貨」。旣然無貨也就罷了，但據某通訊社消息：「前數日有美籍猶太商人，曾以迦陵洋行各義，向該局一次購得羊毛毯五千條。在此商人接獲貨單數小時後，四川路中央弄及其他美貨物資之黑市交易處，即有大批毛毯出現。」這分明是確確實實的「有貨」，而是被一些利令智昏的高級華人，壟斷了「出貨」。我們看到馬路邊的「黑貨」，實在懷念那般掌握配售大權的「寳貨」不置。「寳貨」們這種「寗贈外商，不與家人」的心理，也許僅僅爲了想藉此撈一筆鈔票，但你們應該再想想：「物資供應局」是中國政府的機關，中國「義利之辨」的古訓難道就可悍然不顧嗎？配售的毛毯是盟邦善意交付給我們的，難道我們就健忘了大美晚報上人家指摘過的「人獸之分」即在於此嗎？鈔票有時而盡，但我們的怒火是不會就此吿戢的！</p>
<p>糞便黑市</p>
<p>在米貴如珠的季節裏，農民對於作爲肥料主要成份的糞便，垃圾之類是視若瓖寳的。在都市中，我們常厭惡那些破曉時分　車聲音的滋擾，其實從這些人們辛勞的收集搬運工作裏，都市的整潔市容賴以維持，我們的生活也間接受其培育和滋養。在目前中國化學肥料事業還未充分發展以前，糞便仍佔據着農民生產費用的重要部份，所以麥季剛要開始，這兩天糞便的黑市行情便激漲起來了。上海商人的聰明至於無孔不入，我們除了表示敬佩之外，實在也需要向當局提出一份備忘錄來：現在上海市能够日產垃圾二千餘噸，糞便三千噸，這是再適當沒有的堆肥原料，爲什麼不能統盤計劃，加以製造，直接配售給農民？「貨惡其棄於地也，不必藏於已」，在抑平糧價聲中，對這些被人們棄若敝屣的廢物，我們深盼常局注意到牠的利用，有效的利用，科學化的利用！</p>
<p>讚揚以外</p>
<p>上月間杭州曾發生過一件人力車夫參議員趙廷秀，被警察毆辱，結果經當局查明懲兇道歉的趣聞。據說這件「代表中國民主精神」的事實已經「震動世界」，因爲美國的各大報紙，非常重視，均以顯著地位譯載。他所刊登出來的消息甚至於較之杭州當地報紙所揭載的還要詳盡切實。佳話遠傳，原屬盛事，很多敏感的人於是對付事都引爲殊榮。不過人家所以特別宣揚我們的民主精神，也正因爲我們被不民主精神，所掩蔽的地方太多了；珍聞適足聳聽，所以纔有這樣一番熱鬧的演出。如果此事發生之初，趙廷秀僅係一人力車夫而非參議員，則一頓毆辱，幾天枸禁，實在太稀鬆平常，以警士之威決不會容忍一個執賤業如拉車的人，在他面前有所置隊爭辯的。參議員是官，人力車夫是民，官民之間所受到的待遇在目前畢竟還有很大的差別。我們在美報讚揚着的「代表中國民主精神的事件」之前，應該覺到無限惶悚和慚愧的。</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Held its Fourth Meeting Yesterday: Representatives Spoke on the Draft Constitution; Discussion of Group Review Methods Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The fifth National Assembly meeting is scheduled for the 30th, from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 1:00 to 6:00. Yu Bin and Wu Tiecheng will serve as chairpersons for the morning and afternoon sessions, respectively. The rotating presidium consists of Wu Tiecheng, Li Huang, Cheng Qian, Zhu Jiahua, Lin Qingnian, Zeng Kuoqing, Liu Hengjing, Yu Yunwu, and Zhou Yongneng from the fifth group. The agenda for the 30th is: A, Representatives who have not yet been sworn in will take the oath of office. B, Reading of the minutes of the fourth meeting and congratulatory messages, etc. C, Matters for discussion: (1) The presidium proposes methods for group review of the draft constitution; (2) Broad expression of opinions on the draft constitution.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The National Assembly Presidium held its eighth meeting at 6:00 PM on the 29th, presided over by Yu Bin. The following matters were decided: (1) Regarding the methods for group review of the draft constitution of the Republic of China, it was decided in principle to establish eight review committees. For the first seven committees, representatives can freely choose to join one or two groups. The eighth group is a comprehensive review committee. Fifteen people will be designated by the presidium from the conveners of the first seven committees, and one person will be nominated by each electoral unit. (2) Each assembly meeting is planned to be held for half a day. Both of the above items will be submitted to the assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] At 3:00 PM on the 29th, the National Assembly continued its fourth meeting. 1,147 representatives were present. Left Shunsheng chaired the meeting, and representatives continued to express their opinions freely. The speakers in order were Liu Wendao, Wang Youqiao, Bao Deming, He Foqing, Ding Ren, Jiang Gongliang, Peng Gechen, Zhu Huiqing, Liu Guanxun, Kong Geng, Kang Zhaogeng, Zhao Shu, Liu Zongping, Zhao Chunxiao, Yin Shuxian, Huang Shaomei, etc. Each expressed their opinions on the draft constitution with great enthusiasm. Many more continued to request to speak. At 6:00 PM, the chairman announced the adjournment. The fifth meeting will be held all day on the 30th, continuing with representatives expressing their opinions on the draft constitution. The following is a summary of the representatives' speeches: Liu Wendao's opinions: (1) In Chapter 1, Article 2, "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire people," the term "people" should be changed to "nationals." (2) The powers of the Legislative Yuan are very large, as stated in Article 58. If the Legislative Yuan continues to maintain its original resolution during reconsideration, it will cause too much difficulty for the President of the Executive Yuan. (3) If a dispute arises between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, the President can convene a temporary meeting to discuss a resolution. Bao Deming's opinions on the draft constitution are (1) suitable for the national conditions, (2) suitable for the needs of the people, (3) considering the evolution after the implementation of the constitution, and (4) in line with the spirit of the founding of the nation. She has the following opinions on women's issues: (1) The National Assembly charter should stipulate that women representatives account for 20% of the total number of representatives. (2) The election charter should stipulate that women account for 20% of the number of members in the various levels of parliament, the Control Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan. (3) The chapter on basic national policies should stipulate a clause on equal employment for women. (4) Women should participate in the Judicial Yuan, the Examination Yuan, and the Executive Yuan. He Foqing's opinions: (1) The National Assembly charter is too far from the spirit of the Prime Minister's legacy. (2) A reserve president should be added to the presidency charter in addition to the vice president. Jiang Gongliang's opinions: (1) China's territory should be explicitly listed in the constitution. (2) Reducing the size of provinces will facilitate the connection between provinces and counties. Peng Gechen's opinions: (1) Article 4 should add the sentence "after being passed by the National Assembly, it will be implemented." (2) The clauses listed in Article 112 are related to the development of provincial administration and should be noted. Zhu Huiqing's opinions: (1) Chapter 3, the National Assembly charter, was revised in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but the principles of the original draft have not been changed. Therefore, it forms an indirectly elected assembly, rather than a national assembly exercising the four powers, which is contrary to the Prime Minister's legacy and the outline of national construction. (2) The National Assembly should focus on occupational elections. Liu Guanxun's opinions: A constitution that is suitable for China's national conditions and meets the current needs is needed. Therefore, it should be carefully formulated and not simply copied from others, resulting in an incomplete constitution. First, a proposal review committee should be formed, and representatives should submit opinions on the constitution, which will be reviewed by the committee and then discussed by chapter. Kong Geng's opinions: In view of the Youth Party representative Yu Jiaju's statement that the constitution should be discussed with an open mind, it is believed that it must be properly discussed. First, each unit should elect representatives to form a draft constitution review committee, propose key points, then conduct group reviews, and then proceed with discussions to formulate a constitution that is suitable for the trends of the times. Chen Shaoxian believes that the Legislative Yuan has too much power, and its governing power should be restricted. Liu Zongping's opinions: (1) It is hoped that a clause guaranteeing the democratic autonomy of the frontier regions can be added to the general principles chapter. (2) The provincial and county system should be changed to a local system, and the "league" should be defined as equal to "province," and "banner" equal to "county" in the local system. Yin Shuxian said that the draft constitution has three advantages: (1) It establishes the status of each party. (2) Broad freedom of the people is guaranteed. (3) The Legislative Yuan becomes a political power institution, but Article 4, the territory of the Republic of China, should be listed.</p>
<h3>Majority of Representatives Oppose the Political Consultative Conference's Draft Constitution; Representatives Who Have Not Been Sworn in Will Take the Oath Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The National Assembly held its fourth meeting on the 29th and began a broad discussion on the draft constitution. At 9:40 AM, Secretary-General Hong reported that 1,627 people had registered, and 1,433 were present, which was sufficient for a quorum. Chairman Zuo Shunsheng then led the meeting to begin with formalities. First, the minutes of the third meeting were reported, followed by Secretary-General Hong reporting on congratulatory messages and letters of leave from representatives (omitted). Chairman Zuo reported on the presidium's decisions: (1) In accordance with Article 5 of the Rules of Procedure, the seats of the Assembly are determined by the presidium. After the fifth meeting of the presidium, the seats were divided according to the electoral units of the representatives and arranged by drawing lots. The seating arrangement for the representatives of each unit was based on the order of the list published by the National Government. The seating arrangements for each representative at the meeting were then determined separately through drawing lots at the sixth meeting of the presidium. (2) In accordance with Article 9 of the National Assembly Organization Law and Article 2 of the General Rules for the Organization of Various Review Committees, a representative qualification review committee was organized. The members and convener were nominated by the presidium. After Zuo's report, representative Xue Dubi was selected and presented a document stating that his father, Xue Shixuan, was too old and requested that he be removed from the list of members of the Representative Qualification Review Committee and replaced with another person. At 9:50 AM, Chairman Zuo announced that representatives should express their opinions on the draft constitution broadly, but no conclusions should be drawn. Instead, various opinions should be sent to the review sub-committees for reference. The discussion then began in the order of requests to speak on the 28th. Secretary-General Hong first read the written opinion of Zhu Jingnong, a representative of the liberal professions, suggesting that representatives raise major issues for discussion in the Assembly, while leaving minor issues to the review sub-committees to save time. Next, Chen Jixian, a representative of the Henan professions, raised two points. The first was that "the American-style government of the people, by the people, for the people in Article 1 of the draft constitution amendment is different from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposal, please pay attention to this." The second was that "the oath of representatives is extremely important. Representatives who have not been sworn in should first complete the procedures before discussing the constitution." After Chen's second point was raised, the atmosphere at the meeting suddenly became tense. The attendees rejected the presidium's decision to sign the oath separately and insisted that the oath-taking ceremony be conducted publicly. Some representatives then raised that the qualifications of representatives had not yet been reviewed, and the constitution could not be discussed. The number of people and candidates for the organization of the Representative Qualification Review Committee should be decided by the Assembly in accordance with the law. Zhang Lisheng, who was selected as a representative, then explained as the chairman of the National Assembly Representative Election Office, saying that the representatives announced by the National Government had been strictly reviewed by the office in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Election Law and issued with representative qualification certificates. The Assembly has now been opened to the fourth meeting, and the review of qualifications is still being carried out, because it is feared that the representative qualification certificates are forged, so that the qualifications of the representatives can be more determined, which is purely to express caution and does not hinder the progress of the Assembly. However, the attendees still insisted that the review should be thorough, and the representatives who had been traitors should be reported to correct the situation. At the same time, in accordance with Article 2 of the General Rules of the Review Committee, the presidium and the secretariat were criticized, saying that the passage of this list was not a problem, but only reporting the number of people and candidates for this prerequisite to the Assembly, and the Central News Agency hastily released the action, which was an illegal act of power. For a time, the whole scene was full of speeches, attacks and rebukes, like a raging surge, and the interpretation of the calculation method of the quorum further fueled the flames. At 10:50, the order was in great chaos, and Chairman Zuo quickly accepted the suggestion of the attendees to put the list to a vote. As a result, the majority voted in favor of the passage, and the recess was announced. At 11:20, the meeting continued. Secretary-General Hong reported that the presidium had gathered and resolved three things: (1) Representatives who have not yet been sworn in will publicly take the oath of office at the fifth meeting on the morning of the 30th. (2) In accordance with Article 61 of the Rules of Procedure, the presidium will use the number announced by the National Government as the standard for calculating the quorum. (3) Please speak in front of the central microphone on the stage to seek clarity and maintain order. As a result, a storm came to an end, and the discussion of the constitution began.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Convened the Ninth Pacification Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] Bai Chongxi hosted a banquet in the Ministry of National Defense conference room at 6:00 PM on the 29th for members of the Executive Yuan Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee, Zhang Lisheng, Yu Hongjun, etc., and the chairmen of the provinces of Chahar, Shandong, Jehol, Henan, and Jiangsu. After the banquet, the ninth pacification meeting was held.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representative Qualifications Determined for Group Review</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The National Assembly Representative Qualification Review Committee held its first meeting at 8:00 AM on the 29th in the representative lounge on the second floor of the Assembly Hall. Chairman Zhang Lisheng decided on the review methods: (1) Review will be carried out in several groups. (2) The Assembly Secretariat will be notified to request that representatives submit their certificates of election for review.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] Chen Ruoqin, a representative of Guangdong professions, said that in the draft constitution amendment, the powers of the Legislative Yuan are even greater than those of the British and American parliaments. The powers of the National Assembly have been stripped away, leaving only the right to elect and impeach the president and the right to initiate and veto the constitution. He advocated restoring the four political powers that the National Assembly should have, so that the National Assembly, which is fully responsible for supervising the government on behalf of the people, is only in name and has no reality.</p>
<p>Wu Jieping, a representative of the Sichuan region, said that the draft constitution amendment, which the National Assembly is discussing as a basis, only took a few hours to complete the legislative process in the Legislative Yuan. This kind of fact is a rare occurrence in history. The perfunctory use of power is also against democracy. In the amendment, the powers of the Legislative Yuan are too large. He himself opposes centralization of power and also opposes checks and balances. The presidential system and the cabinet system were not adopted by the founding father. The Assembly should carefully study and revise this point in accordance with the legacy of the division of powers and functions. Regarding the management of election affairs, he advocated that the constitution should stipulate that it should be the responsibility of public opinion organs to eliminate abuses.</p>
<p>Liu Ruxin, a representative of overseas Chinese, said that overseas Chinese all over the world are unanimously willing to work hard for the construction of the motherland and requested that a clear policy of protecting overseas Chinese be included in the constitution.</p>
<p>Chen Yongxuan, a representative of Hunan professions, advocated three things: (1) The election of National Assembly representatives should also adopt a professional election system. (2) The number of women representatives should be stipulated. (3) The draft constitution amendment steals the name of the five powers and implements the reality of the three powers. It is similar to the American constitution and the past federal provincial autonomy law, which is worth studying and revising into a fundamental national law that is suitable for national conditions and in line with the times. Otherwise, even if the constitution is made, it is as if it has not been made.</p>
<p>Wu Wangji, a representative of Zhejiang professions, also advocated adopting professional elections to make up for the shortcomings of regional elections. He also said that the Legislative Yuan in the draft constitution amendment, except that it cannot turn men into women, can do everything as the central governing authority. The Executive Yuan is restrained by it, the Judicial Yuan becomes a vassal, the Control Yuan cannot supervise, the Examination Yuan cannot conduct examinations, and the National Assembly, the central political authority, cannot control it. After the general public elects it, it is even more out of reach. Such a Legislative Yuan will inevitably be lawless. He advocated that the Assembly should adjust its powers and status. By this time it was 12:00 noon, and Secretary-General Hong announced on behalf of Chairman Zuo that the meeting would continue at 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Business Representatives</h3>
<p>Request the Restoration of the Chapter on National Economy</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The National Assembly business representatives, at the invitation of the National Federation of Commerce on the 29th evening, jointly discussed (1) the professional representative system and (2) the restoration of the chapter on the national economy. More than 50 people, including Chen Qinshi, Han Guangqi, and Zhu Huiqing, attended. First, Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, gave a speech, explaining that the clauses in the constitution regarding the election of National Assembly representatives and chairmen and supervisors only have regional representatives and ignore professional representatives. This point is far from the Prime Minister's legacy. Secondly, the original May Fifth Draft Constitution recorded a chapter on the national economy, with a total of 14 articles, but the current amendment deleted the chapter, and only 5 articles in the national policy involved the national economy. The merchants and guarantees of the people who are most concerned, and the clauses such as donations and taxes, are deleted, ignoring the interests of industry and commerce, and nothing is more serious than this. Agriculture, industry, and commerce are the foundation of the nation. If only the party politics vehicle of governing the country is paid attention to, and agriculture, industry, and commerce are ignored, it is tantamount to abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the secondary. It is impossible to seek nation-building. It is recommended that the business community unite with agriculture, industry, and other sectors to jointly fight for it. It was then decided to use collective strength to submit proposals to the National Assembly Draft Constitution Review Committee in chapters.</p>
<h3>Regulations on the Organization of the Strategic Advisory Committee Promulgated: The Committee is Directly Under the Chairman of the National Government</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The National Government officially promulgated the regulations on the organization of the Strategic Advisory Committee. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The Strategic Advisory Committee is the highest military advisory and wartime senior commander reserve organization, subordinate to the Chairman of the National Government. Article 2: The members of the Strategic Advisory Committee are active generals of the army, navy, and air force who have held important military positions and have outstanding reputation, and are specially appointed by the National Government. The number of members is limited to 19, and one person is designated as the chairman.</p>
<p>Article 3: The Strategic Advisory Committee, in order to study or review military, political, economic, diplomatic, educational, and transportation issues related to strategy, may request the Ministry of National Defense to provide information, and the Ministry of National Defense may send personnel to attend the meeting to report.</p>
<p>Article 4: The Strategic Advisory Committee shall establish a secretariat to manage general affairs, documents, books, materials, and various meeting affairs. Its staffing shall be determined in accordance with the attached table.</p>
<p>Article 5: These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Fourth National Assembly Meeting</h3>
<p>— Our Reporters Pu Dejie and Zhang Ming</p>
<p>After a day of heavy snow on the 28th, the National Assembly Hall on the 29th was still adorned in silver. The white snow on the archway and the top of the hall was gradually melting under the early morning sunlight, dazzlingly beautiful. Together with the vermilion lacquer and gold painting on the buildings and the still unfaded green grass and trees, it was a magnificent sight.</p>
<p>The fourth meeting was chaired by Zuo Shunsheng. Zuo was graceful, calm and composed, but when speaking, he was always too far from the microphone, and many attendees could not fully understand his meaning, which was also a reason for the poor order.</p>
<p>National Assembly representatives took their seats according to the new seating arrangement on the 29th. Many representatives could not find their numbers. Someone said to a Mongolian representative with a smile, "We are in the front, the frontier is leading." A representative said, "Ha! Acquaintances are all sitting together." A representative said, "Limiting socializing has a bit of a feudal flavor."</p>
<p>Ma Xingye told reporters, "Mr. Huang Shaogu and I are both in the People's Rights Review Group. We want to propose that freedom of the press should be clearly listed in the constitution. The United Nations Charter even lists a special clause for it!"</p>
<p>Before the meeting, Bai Chongxi and Chen Cheng met and whispered for a moment. Zheng Yanfen started from his new seat and made a small circle to the left front, socializing in Cantonese Mandarin.</p>
<p>Sun Ke, the chief chairman of the fourth group of the presidium, went up and down the rostrum twice. The first time was when some representatives raised the issue of publicly taking the oath, and the second time was at 10:55, when the order was so chaotic that it could not be maintained. He went on stage and said a word to Chairman Zuo and Secretary-General Hong as he walked, and Chairman Zuo announced "recess" in the chaos, ending the dispute.</p>
<p>After the issue of taking the oath was raised, Secretary-General Hong reported, "The presidium has decided to send the oath to the representatives who did not attend the opening ceremony to take the oath, and ask them to fill in, sign and return it." Chen Jixian, a representative of the Henan professions, said, "No, taking the oath is a dignified matter. Why do it secretly? It should be taken publicly." Hong said again, "If you have any objection to the way the oath is taken, you can ask the presidium to discuss another method." As a result, it was decided to publicly take the oath at the Assembly on the 30th.</p>
<p>The list of members of the Representative Qualification Review Committee and the reporting of representatives who had been traitors caused a great uproar. The former was only reported to the Assembly without seeking consent, which violated Article 11 of the General Rules for the Organization of the Review Committee, "The number of people and candidates for the Representative Qualification Review Committee shall be proposed by the presidium to the Assembly for decision." Chen Jixian said, "This list has not been decided by the Assembly, and the Central News Agency has made an official announcement. May I ask if the Secretariat is deliberately violating the law or is confused? Please ask the derelict Secretary-General to resign." Wang Shuhui, another representative of the Henan professions, also asked the same question and asked Secretary-General Hong to explain. Hong stood up and wanted to speak, but Wang said, "I haven't finished speaking yet, please sit down, Secretary-General." Hong had to sit down, and Wang then criticized the next question: "Secretary-General Hong lightly dismissed the report of representatives who had been traitors as a 'judicial issue'. However, after Representative Zhang Lisheng spoke as the chairman of the Election Office, he could not explain it. May I ask if the representative only preserved the certificate of election without preserving their integrity, can the Secretary-General be responsible? We demand strict review and cannot let traitors join the sacred work of constitution-making."</p>
<p>For the sake of a list of procedures that were not in compliance with the announcement, the representatives launched a massive campaign to hold people accountable. Some said, "The presidium is serving the Assembly because there are too many people in the Assembly, not representing the Assembly to decide everything." Some said, "The powers of the presidium are too great, and the powers of the secretary-general are also not small. What do we representatives need to do?" Some said, "Just the chairman doesn't have to be afraid of trouble, and naturally there will be no trouble. This is a matter of law, not deliberately looking for trouble." Some said, "Everyone will have no problem with this list. If the presidium seeks everyone's consent after the report, it will definitely pass. We are reminding the presidium to pay attention to the legal regulations and respect the status of the Assembly."</p>
<p>Before the recess, speakers sprang up like mushrooms after the rain, and the order was in great chaos. People who were able to push through the crowd to win the right to speak also had to eat a mouthful. Guo Changhe, the third female representative to speak since the opening of the National Assembly, raised the matter of the resignation of Wu Yifang, the female chairman of the presidium, at that time, saying that it should be filled by the female representative with the most votes. Unfortunately, no one paid attention to her words. Zhu Jingnong said, "Please pay attention, colleagues, according to the rules of procedure, we must first obtain the chairman's consent to speak." "What about you?" "Shhh!"</p>
<p>In the chaos, Chairman Zuo announced the vote on that list, and most of the lights were turned on. During the recess, a representative said, "It still doesn't follow the regulations. The number of people and candidates should be voted on separately in order." Another representative said, "Just muddle through, Zuo Shunsheng is the chairman for the first time, forgive him."</p>
<p>Ma Shen Huiyun only arrived at the meeting during the recess. She said, "I went to Xiaguan to distribute clothes to the refugee children. I didn't finish until now. I'm frozen." The reporter said, "They are much warmer." She laughed. A National Assembly staff member who had worked in the Nanjing Red Cross said, "Our chairman is very good, both capable and enthusiastic."</p>
<p>At the fourth meeting, the representatives gained the upper hand. Although the order in the first half was chaotic, the spirit of the rule of law and democracy permeated the entire scene. When the problem was solved after the recess, the discussion of the constitution began, and it went smoothly until the adjournment. Everyone believes that if the representatives can pay more attention to the discussion part of the rules of procedure, and the presidium and the secretariat can clarify their relationship with them and the Assembly more clearly, the National Assembly meeting will definitely become perfect. Someone said, "The current Assembly itself is in a period of political tutelage."</p>
<p>In the speech of the female representative Bao Deming, she greatly praised the reporters. She said: Reporters, you are the mouthpiece of the people and also respect women's rights, so if public opinion can help, the goal can definitely be achieved.</p>
<p>A representative believed that a reserve president should be added to the presidential chapter, and the whole audience was silent. But a representative said calmly, "Don't be surprised, it should be strange at first, but it won't be strange later. All countries in the world have a three-power system, but our Prime Minister created a five-power constitution. At first, our country was very strange, but later it wasn't strange."</p>
<p>The Mongolian representative Liu Zongping spoke with passion, saying repeatedly, "We have traveled thousands of mountains and rivers and suffered all kinds of hardships. What are we here for? We want to be citizens of the Republic of China." His enthusiasm was full and won the applause of the entire audience.</p>
<p>A representative's speech was pretentious, empty, and said "you" at any time, with the intention of speaking outside of the representative's position. The whole audience immediately responded with hisses and jeers. When the last gentleman spoke, he even listed several points, hoping that everyone would pay attention, what to respect dignity, and what to be serious, and the whole audience was not impressed, as if they were listening to instructions.</p>

<h3>法越衝突迄未停止　僑胞損失數千萬　我向雙方提出嚴重交涉</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The conflict between French and Vietnamese troops occurred in Haiphong. Our Consul-General in Hanoi, Yuan Zijian, has been instructed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make serious representations to both the French and Vietnamese sides, requesting that the Chinese quarter be excluded from the combat zone to avoid harming overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Haiphong, 27th] (Delayed) A Central News Agency reporter accompanied French-Vietnamese mixed committee members here to mediate the French-Vietnamese conflict. After several meetings between the two sides on the 21st, the war continued on the 22nd due to disagreements. During the conflict on the 19th, our consulate in Haiphong was shot at by Vietnamese armed elements on the 22nd, and Consul Xie's office was also hit. After the 22nd, in the battle to suppress the Vietnamese, the French army used heavy weapons to attack Vietnamese concentrated areas, and the Chinese quarter was also affected. After five days of battle, the French army gradually advanced and controlled most of the urban area. The Vietnamese used the Chinese quarter as a cover to resist. Many fires broke out in the city. It is said that several places in the Chinese quarter were destroyed. Staff of the Chinese-language "Gang Dao Daily" are all in the Vietnamese area, and news is unknown. The newspaper has not been published for a week. In this conflict, the losses of overseas Chinese are feared to exceed tens of millions of Vietnamese currency.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 28th] It is reported that the French government is considering sending reinforcements to Vietnam to help maintain order in response to the conflict. A recent telegram from Saigon stated that French troops had driven the Vietnamese Republican Army out of the Chinese quarter of Haiphong, and fighting is still ongoing in Haiphong and Lang Son. The Haiphong airfield has been retaken by 500 paratroopers sent by the French army.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 28th] After the conflict between French and Vietnamese troops in Haiphong and Lang Son, it has been learned that the conflict has stopped, and Haiphong has returned to normal and is peaceful. Radio companies have also resumed work. The Chinese consul has approached the Vietnamese authorities, requesting the release of two overseas Chinese who were arrested without cause. In addition, Chinese groups stationed in Vietnam have telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek about the French-Vietnamese conflict. French casualties are few. According to the chairman of the Lang Son Overseas Chinese Association, there were no casualties among overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 29th] It has been learned that today, Vietnamese army coastal batteries in Capa, North Vietnam, fired on the French cruiser "Suffren" and a destroyer, but no damage was caused. The French commissioner for Tonkin and Annam, Mr. Lie, has protested to President Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh Republic, saying that he will be forced to take all appropriate measures to prevent the recurrence of such absolutely hostile acts.</p>
<h3>善救物資秉公分配　絕無裝備軍隊事　行總發言人駁覆董必武</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] On the 27th of this month, Mr. Dong Biwu, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, issued a statement pointing out some matters regarding the distribution of relief supplies by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA). In order to understand the truth, our reporter visited the CRRRA spokesman, who told us the following: The handling of UNRRA materials, in accordance with the basic agreement between the National Government and UNRRA, all matters concerning the distribution, storage, transportation, and issuance of relief supplies must be discussed and handled in consultation with UNRRA personnel. Especially for the issuance of supplies, UNRRA has regional representatives stationed in branch offices in each province to observe the distribution of materials. Mr. Dong Biwu said: "The authorities have directly or indirectly used UNRRA materials, equipment, and transportation to equip the army," which is obviously not based on facts. UNRRA staff in China, including citizens of various countries around the world, can all prove that Mr. Dong's statement lacks factual basis.</p>
<p>Communist Areas' Transportation is Blocked</p>
<p>Our office is the implementing agency for the basic agreement. Since its establishment, it has been continuously striving to request the CCP to allow our office's materials and personnel to enter CCP-controlled areas to provide relief to the disaster victims in those areas, and to provide our personnel with operational convenience, based on Article 2 of the UNRRA resolution, the principle of non-discrimination. For a year, our office has continuously transported relief supplies to CCP areas, but most CCP-controlled areas have always been under military conditions, with frequent battles, and transportation hindered. Material transportation is obstructed, and personnel have no safety guarantee in their work. This is a difficulty of the objective environment that cannot be resolved by the sole efforts of our office.</p>
<p>Ignoring Important Facts</p>
<p>Mr. Dong said: "Of the 1,130,349 tons of UNRRA materials arriving in China, the CCP areas have received only 9,820 tons to date, a proportion of only 7.5 per thousand." The proportion sought by Mr. Dong is only an abstract calculation, ignoring important facts. According to the situation, not every province in the country has a CCP-controlled area. Hubei, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have the existence of CCP-controlled areas. Our office has eight branch offices in the above-mentioned areas. If the percentage of materials received by the CCP-controlled area is calculated, the sum of the materials obtained by the above-mentioned eight branch offices should be used as the denominator, and the sum of the materials distributed by this office to various branch offices should not be used as the standard. As of the end of October this year, the above-mentioned eight branch offices received a total of 224,207 tons of materials, and more than 22,000 tons of materials were sent to the CCP-controlled area, the ratio should be 10%, not 7.5 per thousand. Moreover, not all UNRRA materials have been distributed, some materials are being processed and assembled, some are still in transit, and some heavy equipment is not needed by the CCP-controlled area, such as railway equipment, the CCP does not have a railway organization, if it is allocated, it is tantamount to waste. Mr. Dong said, "The Communist area has only received more than 50 tons of medical equipment." This is the figure before June. At present, the CCP-controlled area has received more than 300 tons of medicine.</p>
<p>Overturning the UNRRA Resolution</p>
<p>Mr. Dong requested UNRRA to directly carry out the distribution and issuance of materials in the CCP-controlled areas, and said that "the CCP Liberated Area Relief and Rehabilitation Association provides the most effective assistance." I can answer Mr. Dong that the UNRRA Board of Directors has already stipulated in its resolution that the relief affairs of the countries accepting relief shall be handled by the governments of those countries themselves, and UNRRA shall not directly handle them. This agreement also has the same provisions. Mr. Dong's statement requires maintaining the UNRRA resolution and this agreement, but making this kind of accusation is tantamount to overturning the UNRRA resolution and the basic agreement. In short, our office has always based the distribution of materials on the principles of the UNRRA resolution, without any discrimination. In the future, we will also strengthen the relief work in various places with a consistent spirit, focusing on the needs of the people, without any discrimination. This original intention will surely be understood by all parties.</p>
<h3>訪問國大代表　胡定安博士談衛生行政</h3>
<p>In order to be concerned about the major issue of "national health", the reporter made a special visit to Dr. Hu Ding'an, representative of medical doctors and pharmacists. Dr. Hu is currently the president of National Jiangsu Medical College and the executive director of the Chinese Public Health Society. He has long advocated and been enthusiastic about public health. He distributed a booklet entitled "Why is Health Administration Not Included in the Constitution" to all the representatives at the conference the day before yesterday, elaborating in detail the close relationship between "health administration" and "constitutional government," and emphasizing that national health should be regarded as the foundation of the country in the Constitution. When the reporter asked Dr. Hu for his specific opinions on amending the constitution this time, Dr. Hu answered this question by listing Articles 120 and 122 of the Soviet Constitution, which both guarantee national health and have active implementation policies. After World War II, countries such as the United States, Britain, and France further regarded national health as a national resource. In particular, the British Health Act announced in March of this year, "All people enjoy free treatment," and Article 21 of the UN's New Bill of Rights, "The state guarantees that all people can enjoy national health and the protection of pregnant women, public health, and various measures derived from science," are the most prominent.</p>
<p>The short lifespan of our people, the high disease rate, and the alarming infant mortality rate make raising health standards an urgent requirement of the times. Therefore, I am very willing to invite colleagues in the medical field to propose that there must be clear provisions in the Constitution for healthcare and prevention, and further to increase the health of the people, in order to meet the needs of national construction. I also hope that colleagues in the press will give more publicity to "the importance of health" in terms of public opinion. This health right must be fought for by the people of civilized countries. In recent years, we have advocated national health and health education, and we have worked hard to promote it based on raising health standards.</p>
<p>Snowflakes were flying, and we talked for more than ten minutes under the window. We talked very enthusiastically about "health issues" and did not feel the cold before ending. We, from the standpoint of reporters, also expressed our sympathy for the common advocacy.</p>
<h3>全國鐵路海港視察工作完成　損毀鐵路修復至戰前程度　預計需費美金三億八千萬</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The inspection of railways and seaports in mainland China by the Executive Yuan's Engineering Planning Group has been completed, and the final report is now being compiled for submission to the Executive Yuan. The report includes the inspection process, the extent of damage, the materials, funds, and time required for repair. There were about 12,000 kilometers of railways in mainland China, and currently more than 3,000 kilometers have been damaged, more than half of which were destroyed by the Communist army. To repair all the damaged railways to the pre-war level would require an estimated US$380 million, which exceeds the original cost of constructing all the railways in mainland China. Even if the domestic situation stabilizes and there are no problems with funds and materials, it will take at least two and a half years to complete this repair work.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications plans to accelerate the repair of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and strengthen the Guangdong-Hankou Railway next year. Work on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has now resumed. It is also planned to lay the Tianshui-Lanzhou section and the Guangzhou-Liuzhou section next year in order to complete the ideal northwest and southwest trunk lines.</p>
<p>As for seaports, from Huludao to Hainan Island, the damage is not as severe as that of the railways. According to the group's estimate, to repair it to the pre-war condition and make some improvements, it will cost about US$80 million.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the communications authorities plan to merge the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway (from Jiujiang to Nanchang) and the Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway (from Hangzhou to Ningbo) into the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for ease of management.</p>
<h3>蘇北五里莊等處收復淮陰情形已穩定　膠東共軍增兵局勢又緊</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Zhenjiang, 29th] The National Army has recovered Wulizhuang today, and the situation in Huaiyin is becoming more stable. It is also reported that Shi Tang, Ma Dian, Mao Qiao, and Wei Dian outside Huai'an were also entered by the National Army at the same time today. The Huaiyin-Zhenjiang long-distance bus service also resumed operations on the 29th.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Taixian, 29th] Mr. Li Mo'an was originally scheduled to come to Dongtai for inspection on the 29th, but due to rain, he may come here on the 30th. According to sources from Guan Xiang, Mr. Li may be stationed in Dongtai permanently in the future to command and deal with the current situation nearby.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Taixian, 29th] The Communists concentrated a regiment or more of troops and attacked the National Army's position at Jiulidian yesterday. The defending National Army counterattacked, and the two sides are currently facing each other near Xiaxi. It rained and snowed in Dongtai on the 29th, and there was no progress in the war.</p>
<h3>軍校畢業學生附逆者除學籍</h3>
<p>蔣生席通令各機關</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Chairman Chiang recently issued a circular to all agencies nationwide, stating that any military academy graduates who have participated in puppet organizations and have been convicted according to law should be expelled from their studies.</p>
<h3>蘇北五里莊等處收復　淮陰情形已穩定　膠東共軍增兵局勢又緊</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Zhenjiang, 29th] Confirmed news: The situation in northern Jiangsu is not as serious as rumored. The elite troops of the National Army who rushed to Huaiyin from Xuzhou have crossed Suqian and Suining, and defeated the Zhang Aiping troops of the Communist Army who invaded the territory of Suining County, and are marching towards Siyang. People who know the geography of northern Jiangsu and the current military strength of the National and Communist armies told this newspaper's reporter that the Communist army's previous retreat from Gaoyou, Baoying, and Xinghua was originally a plan to preserve its strength, and it never made main contact with the National Army advancing on northern Jiangsu. Now it is moving after being extremely still. While the National Army is strictly abiding by the ceasefire order, it took the opportunity to launch an offensive. Whether from a military point of view or political influence, it is unwise. Because the National Army in northern Jiangsu is forced to fight on the plains, victory can be assured. He believes that once the National and Communist armies in northern Jiangsu enter a decisive battle, Lianshui, Shuyang, Yanfu can be recovered, and the problem of northern Jiangsu can be completely resolved at that time. The focus of the war in northern Jiangsu seems to be in the territory of Suqian, Suining, and Siyang, because the Communist army is trying to cut off the Xuzhou-Huaiyin communication line and put more pressure on the National Army in Huaian.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Jinan, 28th] The Communist army has greatly increased its troops and is actively deploying an offensive. The situation in Jiaodong has become tense again. The Communist army along the Jiaoji Railway has increased to 200,000, most of which are concentrated in Jiaodong. 50,000 of the New Fourth Army are in the Nanwangzhu area south of Gaomi, and 20,000 are near Lanzhuang north of Gaomi. The Communist army surrounding Yexian has also increased to 40,000. The Communist army disrupting the southern countryside of Jinan retreated to the south, and the air in Jinan was relieved. There was infighting among the Communist army in Taian. Anti-war slogans such as "Why are we still fighting after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War? We want to return to our hometown!" have been found in the city.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Local System We Advocate</h3>
<p>As the Constitution of the Republic of China is about to be drafted, we feel that the "Local System" chapter of the "Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution" and the "Local System" clause of the Draft Constitution Amendment both need to be reviewed. Therefore, we offer our decades of research experience as a reference.</p>
<p>We also advocate that China should have a balanced local system. To achieve balance, we believe that the first step is to implement a "division." The relationship between the central and local governments has been ambiguous since the establishment of the Republic of China. As a result, the central government always claims that local authorities are separatist and fail to implement national laws, while local governments at all levels and the general public believe that the central government is moving towards extreme centralization, interfering at every turn, making it impossible to talk about autonomy. To correct this long-standing problem, we believe that it is best to separate everything. After separation, everyone handles their own affairs, maintains their own position, and does not interfere with each other.</p>
<p>How to divide? First: We advocate that provinces, counties, cities, townships, and towns should all be listed as local units. What is a local unit? (1) It must have a definite area; (2) It must have residents; (3) It must have an organization. This organization must be a legal person. Because it is a legal person, it can be a defendant and plaintiff in law, can have property, and has the right to dispose of property, can enter into legal contracts, and can levy taxes; (4) It must have a budget; above it, there is only a supervisory agency, not a command agency. Since the local unit is interpreted in this way, the local units of China should obviously be: (1) Province; (2) City (city under the Executive Yuan or city under the province); (3) County; (4) Township; (5) Town.</p>
<p>Cities, townships, and towns are the most basic local units because there are no local units below them. In France, cities, townships, and towns are called "Commune," and in Germany, they are called "Gemeinde," both of which are considered the most basic. If townships and towns are not on the same line as cities, it is unreasonable, and townships and towns will never have the hope of being established. Why have small cities and general villages in Europe and the United States reached such a level of modernization? It is because they have an autonomous government.</p>
<p>Second: We advocate a clear division between national administration and autonomous administration. There are three ways to divide: (1) List national administration and autonomous administration; (2) List national administration, and what is not listed is autonomous administration; (3) List autonomous administration, and what is not listed is national administration. We advocate the third method.</p>
<p>For the division process, we advocate that the state first divide with provinces and cities (cities under the Executive Yuan), and then the provinces divide reasonably with counties and cities (cities under the province). Finally, the county autonomous administration is then transferred and distributed to township and town units. Cities, townships, and towns are the local units closest to the residents, and we advocate that cities, townships, and towns should be allocated more autonomous administrative matters. For example: the following seventeen items should be listed as part of the autonomous administration, and should be allocated to city, township, and town units: (1) Fire protection; (2) Social education; (3) Roads and bridges; (4) Parks and fields; (5) Water conservancy; (6) Transportation (trams, buses, etc.); (7) Electricity; (8) Gas; (9) Public drinking water; (10) Cemeteries; (11) Food management; (12) Economic undertakings; (13) Local banks; (14) Cooperative undertakings; (15) Relief; (16) Housing management; (17) Public utilities. The purpose of autonomy is for residents to seek their own welfare. If the central government seeks these seventeen autonomous administrative matters on behalf of the residents, it will inevitably be irrelevant. If it is said that residents can use these seventeen items to resist the central government and declare independence, no one will believe it. On the contrary, the central government controls military affairs, diplomacy, police, currency, tariffs, national defense industry, trunk line transportation, education policy, and systems, etc. Who has the ability to resist the central government and declare independence?</p>
<p>Third: We advocate a clear division between national tax sources and autonomous tax sources. This can also be done using the principles and allocation methods of dividing national administration and autonomous administration. That is to say: autonomous tax sources are listed, and those not listed are national tax sources. After the national tax sources are divided with provinces and cities (cities under the Executive Yuan), the provinces and counties (cities under the province) will make a reasonable allocation, and the counties will further allocate them to the townships and towns. However, one point must be noted: in countries that practice autonomy, land tax (field tax) is mostly listed within the autonomous tax sources. Therefore, the most important item of China's autonomous tax sources is still the field tax.</p>
<p>Fourth: We advocate the nomination and election of heads of local units. The heads of local units have two identities. One is the representative of the central government, who, in the locality, accepts the orders of the central government (or its representative) to handle national administrative matters. The other is the head of the local autonomous group, who, in accordance with the resolutions of the autonomous legislative body, handles autonomous administrative matters. Since he represents both parties, why should he be selected by one party? Therefore, we believe that the election of provincial governors and county magistrates is not a fair method. In continental countries, county magistrates are mostly appointed by the central government. For example, the county magistrate in France is not elected by the people. China's feudal ideology has not been completely eliminated, and it is necessary to eradicate any possibility of separatism. If provincial governors and county magistrates are elected by the people, who can guarantee that they will faithfully implement the central government's decrees in the locality? It is possible for them to become regional strongmen in a moment's change. Some people say that the heads of local units in Britain and the United States are all elected by the people. Why is it that democratic China is not elected by the people? There are two answers to this question. One is that Britain and the United States are countries with extreme local decentralization. The second is that the national administrative matters that should be handled locally in Britain and the United States mostly have separate branches that directly command and handle them. The reason for this is that local autonomous governments are all elected by the people and cannot effectively implement central orders. As a compromise between the continental system and the British and American systems, we advocate that the central government nominate several candidates for the heads of local units and hand them over to the local residents for election, or that the local residents elect several candidates and report them to the central government for selection and appointment.</p>
<p>Fifth: We advocate that each unit head should have separate central and autonomous institutions. Since each unit head has two aspects of affairs to handle, why not clearly separate the handling institutions instead of mixing them together? One is a central institution, and the other is an autonomous institution. However, the head is just the same person. The central institution only follows the orders of the central government (or its representative), handles national administrative matters, its budget is part of the national budget, and temporary entrusted matters, such as construction, airport, etc., are also allocated special funds by the central government, without affecting local funds. The autonomous institution handles autonomous administration, and follows the resolutions of the local legislative body, in accordance with the autonomous budget, only responsible to the local area. If administrative disputes occur between the central institution and the autonomous institution, the administrative court will make a ruling, and the central government (or its representative) cannot resolve the disputes between the two parties with instructions. The method of dividing the central institution and the autonomous institution is not our invention. The Prussian system is like this, and it is effective. France was the first country to implement the method of administrative courts resolving disputes between the central and local governments. Except for Britain and the United States, almost all countries in the world that practice autonomy are like this.</p>
<p>Sixth: We advocate that local units should start autonomy at the same time, but the scope of autonomy can be different. Practicing autonomy without sufficient economic conditions is tantamount to idle talk. Practicing autonomy without sufficient intellectual conditions is simply like a blind man riding a blind horse. Mr. Sun Yat-sen saw this point, so there were regulations during the period of political tutelage. We advocate determining the conditions for autonomy. Where the conditions are sufficient, all autonomous administrative matters are handed over to the autonomous institutions for handling; where the conditions for autonomy are insufficient, a number of matters are proposed through legislative procedures and entrusted to the central institutions at the same level for handling on their behalf. Once the conditions are permitted, they will be returned to the autonomous institutions. Border areas, with backward culture and economy, naturally cannot talk about autonomy in terms of conditions, but it is also possible to start with one or two items. For example, relief and fire protection always seem to be manageable. This method is not our invention either. The autonomous administrative matters handled by local governments at all levels in the United Kingdom are different, and the autonomous administration in the United Kingdom is obtained bit by bit from parliamentary bills.</p>
<p>The above six items are our comprehensive propositions. We believe that only in this way can we obtain a constitution of balanced power. We have tried to talk about this constitution of balanced power with the ruling party, and we can actually receive unexpected effects. First, it can dredge the talents of the whole country and avoid the central government becoming the object of struggle. Second, from the central government to the city, township, and town units, there are central institutions that consistently implement the central government's decrees, and the so-called autonomy is only a few matters related to the lives of the residents, which is not enough to be the basis for resisting the central government and declaring independence. However, if the provincial governors and county magistrates are unconditionally elected by the people, then there is no guarantee. Standing on the side of the opposition party, it can also solve some problems and entrust infinite hope. For example, if the territory that has been obtained is not returned to the central government, everyone will say that you are separatist. If there is this constitution of balanced power, then what is returned to the central government is only national administration, and autonomous administration can obviously still be controlled. Isn't this solving the current so-called local regime problem again? Second, each level of autonomous institution, in addition to the central government's legal supervision, is not subject to the command of higher-level institutions. If each party, faction, and non-party faction can obtain the autonomous political structure of a local unit, they can also display their ambitions. However, if national administration and autonomous administration are not separated, or if national tax sources and autonomous tax sources are not separated, or if central institutions and autonomous institutions are not separated, then the central government of the ruling party will inevitably use its mixed powers to interfere with local autonomy.</p>
<p>At the final moment, we hope that the ruling party, the opposition party, and people across the country will consider this issue. That is, "The Local System We Advocate."</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan's Zhejiang Office Allocates Funds to Build Straw Houses to Shelter Poor Farmers; 100 Houses to be Built in Each of Wukang and Several Other Counties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th] Zhejiang is experiencing a severe housing shortage, especially in the counties of Wukang, Fuyang, Changxing, Hangzhou, and Xiaoshan, where the losses are extremely large. The Zhejiang Office of the Executive Yuan originally planned to build straw houses universally in rural areas to provide emergency relief, which would require 1.5 billion yuan. When Director Huo came to Hangzhou, he indicated that the work could be carried out first in areas with the greatest losses. Director Sun went to negotiate, but without success. Therefore, it was decided to allocate 100 million yuan from the Office's own funds to build 100 houses in rural areas of each county first. Families with three or more direct blood relatives will be provided with these houses free of charge.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th] The Zhejiang Construction Department is stepping up construction. It has been holding symposiums on agriculture, transportation, water conservancy, and cooperation for several days to review work and study problems. It has also invited Yang Jiandong, Director of the Provincial Department of Transportation, to go to Beijing to exchange views with the directors of the transportation departments of other provinces and discuss national and provincial highway issues.</p>
<h3>Demolishing Dikes and Abandoning Fields in Yinshan Lake Affects the Livelihood of Thousands of Migrant Farmers; Joint Petition to Retract the Order</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 29th] During the period of enemy occupation, migrant vagrants in Yinshan Lake of this county had reclaimed a large number of lake fields along the coast. After the victory, local gentry, in view of the increasing occupation of lake fields, which hindered water conservancy and transportation, had requested that the fields be returned to the lake. However, the migrant farmers, relying on the fields for their livelihoods, expressed their opposition. At that time, the two sides argued fiercely. As a result, the authorities formulated a compromise plan to maintain the original state of the lake fields temporarily, while actively launching dredging and reclamation projects, which were handled by the Taihu Lake Basin Engineering Office, so as to avoid hindering water conservancy and transportation and seek a win-win situation. However, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee recently received a telegram from the National Water Conservancy Committee, ordering it to immediately stop the dredging and reclamation project and to promptly demolish the dikes and open the dams in order to completely abandon the fields and turn them back into the lake, so as to maintain water conservancy and transportation. After the Lake Basin Engineering Office, after forwarding the order to the public, the migrant farmers along the lake caused an uproar. Everyone was terrified, because the reclaimed lake fields had reached more than 8,000 mu, which was the basis for the lives of thousands of migrant farmers. Once they were returned to the lake, the consequences would be worrying. They recently jointly submitted a petition to the county government and other relevant agencies, appealing to retract the order.</p>
<h3>The Suzhou National Goods Company Allowed to be Returned by the Enemy Property Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou] The Beiju National Goods Company, the largest commercial center in Suzhou, was founded in 1933 by industrial and commercial magnates and gentry. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was occupied by the enemy and renamed "Daimaru Company," operating department stores and extracting the blood and sweat of the people. After the victory, it was taken over by the Party and Government Reception Committee as enemy property and transferred to the Suzhou Office of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau for disposal. The Board of Directors of the National Goods Company repeatedly requested its return. The Enemy Property Bureau has now approved the following three principles in principle: (1) The building structure will be temporarily allowed to be kept under guarantee after personnel verify it; (2) The furniture must be verified within five days with evidence; (3) Rebellious shares will be automatically reported and frozen. The Board of Directors of the National Goods Company has submitted a guarantee and is scheduled to take over the custody, so as to start restoration immediately.</p>
<h3>A New Highway to be Built from Yangzhou to Guazhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Yangzhou] The transportation between here and Zhenjiang, the provincial capital, is by steamboat on the waterway. The only highway is the "Jiewei Highway" (from Yangzhou to Liuweizhen). In recent years, the pier at Liuweizhen on the riverbank has collapsed due to river erosion, and the safety of travelers has become a problem. In view of this, the Jiangsu Construction Department recently plans to build a new highway between Yangzhou and Zhenjiang. The starting and ending points of the new highway are from Xinqiao outside the South Gate of Yangzhou to Guazhou. On the 26th, Technician Zhou Yushan arrived in Yangzhou to survey the route of the new highway. It is estimated that the entire construction project will be reported to the Jiangdu County Government for construction, bidding, and commencement of work as soon as the survey is completed. It is expected to be completed within this year and open to traffic on New Year's Day in 1947.</p>
<h3>Cabbage in Chongming is Mostly Hollow This Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongming] In the third and fourth districts of this county, a large amount of cabbage is planted. It is white in color, delicious in taste, and sold to Shanghai, where it is famous far and wide. It is now the harvest season, but since the beginning of autumn this year, there has been very little rainfall, so the cabbage hearts are dry and hollow, and the harvest has been greatly reduced. The price of cabbage has been falling in recent days, and sales have been sluggish, while various costs are extremely high, resulting in not a small loss for the general farmers.</p>
<h3>A Strange Thief in a Girls' School at Midnight; A Janitor Beats Him to Death; Four Assailants Sentenced to Seven Years Each</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an] The case of the janitor of the Provincial Girls' Normal School beating a person to death, which caused a sensation, was only given a single public trial by the Chang'an District Court on the 11th of this month and was sentenced on the 19th: the four janitors, who used weapons to beat to death a man disguised as a woman who sneaked into the girls' dormitory late at night on September 29, were all sentenced to seven years in prison. During the public trial last week, the principal of the school was not prosecuted, but only appeared in court as a body (because he was staying at the school that night when the incident occurred). He and the defense lawyers for the defendants all emphasized that the case was purely a theft by a villain and had no "romantic" element.</p>
<h3>The Kunshan Strike</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunshan] At about 8:00 a.m. on the 27th, Zhang Wujun, a graduate of the second phase of the Police Training Institute, went to the Fuxing Rice Store on Xiaoximen Street in the county in plain clothes to borrow a carrying pole for use. At that time, because the policeman's attitude was not good, a misunderstanding occurred between the two sides. Fang Liansheng, a member of the local Self-Defense Corps, went to mediate, but because the two sides' opinions differed, he angered the policeman, who beat the corps member. The situation was serious for a time, and the shops went on strike, demanding punishment for the perpetrator. It is reported that after this case occurred, it has been handled by County Magistrate Shen, and a complete solution has been reached.</p>
<h3>Winter Defense in Yangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Yangzhou] As the winter season is approaching, the military, political, and police authorities of this county, in order to prevent scattered bandits from entering the country, to prevent bandits from harassing, and to ensure security, have recently jointly organized a "Jiangdu County Military and Police Team Winter Defense Joint Command." A chief commander has been appointed, and Deputy Chief of Staff Chen Zhizhong of the Fourth Division of the stationed army has been designated to serve as the commander. Two deputy commanders have been appointed, namely Chief of Staff Liu of the Corps Management Zone and County Magistrate Zhang. Three groups, namely, General Affairs, Supervision, and Trial Training, have also been appointed. The headquarters is located in the county police station, and offices are set up in each district. The implementation time of the defense is from December 1 to the end of March next year in the urban and suburban areas, and from December 10 in the rural areas.</p>
<h3>A Bizarre Murder Case Occurs in Hushuguan; An Officer is Found Dead in a Barren Hill After Disappearing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou] Sun Yuncheng, a student of the 52nd Company of the 7th Brigade of the 17th Officer Corps of the Central Training Corps stationed in Hushuguan, 27 years old, from Wuhu, was suddenly visited by a middle-aged man wearing a gray cloth shirt and pants who spoke with a northern accent on the morning of the 15th of this month. He visited Sun Yuncheng at the brigade headquarters, and his expression was very hurried. At that time, Sun had gone out on official business, and the man waited near the brigade headquarters for a long time until he left at about 5:00 p.m. Unexpectedly, Sun did not return to the team that day and was reported missing. People were sent to search everywhere, but there was still no news. The person in charge of the team thought that Sun worked in the department and usually did not leave his footprints. He was very disciplined. Now that he did not return, it was feared that there would be an accident. He immediately reported the information to the brigade headquarters and wrote to the Hushuguan Police Station and the town office, asking them to investigate strictly. According to the Hushuguan Police Station, a military corpse was found in the barren hills of the 13th Bao on the 18th and 19th, and it disappeared on the 20th. The team inquired about the corpse's height, appearance, and clothing, and they were very similar to the missing Sun Yuncheng. According to the situation, it was sufficient to prove that a bizarre murder case had occurred. In addition to sending personnel to strictly investigate and arrest the murderer, the brigade headquarters has sent a letter to the county police局, ordering them to assist in the investigation.</p>
<h3>Tang Enbo to Inspect the Border Areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; To Depart Soon; To Instruct on Suppression and Pacification</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 29th] Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, in order to understand the real situation of the Suppression Zone in the border areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, is scheduled to go to the important areas of the three provinces for inspection in the coming days, and to instruct on the policy of suppression and pacification, so as to consolidate the security of Jiangnan. It is reported that after completing the inspection task in the border areas, Tang will go to Shanghai to report to the press.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Haining] Bandits in various parts of this county are as rampant as ever. On the 27th, the Wu-Xia express boat was sailing from Tudian to Xia. When passing Shenchating on the way, four bandits suddenly came out and ordered the boat to stop. They searched and robbed for half an hour. Later, the Tu-Xia express boat was robbed again when passing the area. In order to prevent bandits, the county government has decided to divide the entire county into nine routes, with the cooperation of the police, security team, and security police team, to patrol day and night, in order to eliminate them.</p>
<h3>The Fengdong to Liuhegou Railway Will Soon Open to Traffic</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinxiang] After the National Army recovered Liuhegou, the Zhang-Luo Railway Engineering Team was ordered to go north to rush to repair the railway. Now the train between Anyang and Tangyin is unobstructed. It has now crossed the Zhang River Bridge north. As for the Feng-Liu branch line, two-thirds of it has been completed and is scheduled to be completed by the end of the month. The coal reserves in the Liuhegou Coal Mine are about 5,000 tons. Some of the machinery that was dismantled by the Communist Army has now been found in villages about 20 kilometers away from the mine. The workers of the mine are trying to transport them back for installation and resume production as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Central Government Will Send Personnel to Zhejiang to Investigate the Qilong Hydropower Project</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th] The Qilong Hydropower Project on the Qiantang River is being planned and built by the provincial government. It is now requesting the central government to allocate funds for joint construction. The central government has agreed in principle and may send personnel to Zhejiang to investigate the design work, which may be completed in half a year or a year.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou] The Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan recently responded to the province's request for funds for various water conservancy projects as follows: (1) It is considered important to allocate 2.30494 billion yuan for the Cao'e River Flood Control Project, and 230 million yuan will be allocated from the Post-War Relief Fund of the Executive Yuan Water Conservancy Association, and the rest will be raised by the local government. However, it is found that the benefited land is only 32,400 mu, and each mu requires 72,400 yuan, which seems too large. It is necessary to re-study, distinguish between urgent and non-urgent, and consider saving measures. This allocation will be made after the local government has a way to raise funds. (2) The Executive Yuan believes that the request for 1.68716 billion yuan for the Xiaoshan Nansha Dike Project is related to the dike project on the opposite bank and should be handled in a coordinated manner. (3) It is approved to allocate an additional 50 million yuan for the Puyang River Flood Control Project, and the funds will also be allocated after the local government has a way to raise funds. (4) The request to increase the allocation for the Fuyang Chengnan River Dike Project is not approved.</p>
<h3>A Boat Capsizes in Huangtian Port</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin] Zhang Xilong, a resident of Jingjiang Xinport, bought 31 piglets and sailed from Baji Port to Cheng on the morning of the 27th, transporting them to Wuxi. When the boat arrived at Huangtian Port, a northwest wind suddenly rose, and the pig boat was overturned by huge waves. Piglets flowed into the river. They were rescued by the Yidu boat. There was also a small boat of Lu Yonggen, carrying 18 passengers, which was also overturned by the wind and waves. A pregnant woman drowned. The rest were rescued by a red boat and temporarily housed in the Yidu Bureau for accommodation and sent back to their ancestral homes.</p>
<h3>Wanted Xia Zhen, a Traitor; Former Puppet County Magistrate of Rugao</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 29th] Xia Zhen, the puppet county magistrate of Rugao and the puppet director of the Ruan Special District Office, abused and killed many underground workers when he was a puppet official. After the victory, Wang Xuewen and others, victims, applied to the Capital High Court for a bill of indictment, which was transferred to the Suzhou High Procuratorate for investigation. However, Xia Zhen had already escaped. The Suzhou High Court issued an arrest warrant on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Changshu Organizes a Visiting Delegation to Inquire About the Suffering of the People</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changshu] In order to investigate the suffering of the people, the County Council organized a visiting delegation. Zhao Jin and two councilors from the Meili District went to Fushan Town for inspection on the 27th. In addition to meeting with local people to listen to their opinions, they also convened self-defense team members to speak and console the veterans. They returned to the city on the same day.</p>
<h3>Reader Opinions Regulations</h3>
<p>(1) This column is absolutely open, and the author is responsible for the content. But avoid being verbose. (2) Do not attack private individuals, and do not submit one manuscript to two places. (3) Contributors must specify "Reader Opinions Manuscript" and must provide their real name and address, but they may use a pen name when publishing. (4) No payment will be made for manuscripts in this column. (5) The newspaper has the right to abridge manuscripts. (6) Whether or not a manuscript is adopted will not be notified by letter. (7) The newspaper may, if necessary, forward the manuscript to relevant agencies for reference.</p>
<h3>Improper Pricing of Reserved Seat Tickets</h3>
<p>Since the victory, the two railway authorities have strived to rectify the transportation system, which is commendable. Since the implementation of reserved seating, order has been maintained and passengers find it convenient. However, the Railway Bureau's pricing for reserved seat tickets, especially for the "Jinling" and "Qiantang" express trains, two Beijing-Shanghai through trains with reserved seats, is genuinely unfair. For example, on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, the entire journey is 199 kilometers, and a second-class ticket costs 8,500 yuan. However, for these two trains, from Shanghai to Suzhou, or Suzhou to Shanghai, the distance is only 76 kilometers, less than half of the entire Shanghai-Hangzhou journey, yet the second-class ticket between Shanghai and Suzhou costs as much as 12,000 yuan. This is simply inappropriate in terms of both reason and fairness. Reserved seating is indeed well-organized and comfortable, and it is understandable that the ticket price is higher than ordinary special express trains, but it is unacceptable to place the entire price increase on short-distance passengers, causing them to suffer too much. If the Railway Bureau is concerned about the large number of reserved seat passengers and wants to limit it slightly, it could consider increasing the special express ticket price by a certain percentage as a reserved seat fee, which would be a more appropriate solution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Suzhou Station on the Beijing-Shanghai line is known for its passenger congestion. I have traveled from Suzhou to Shanghai several times, and as soon as the train arrives at the station, it is already completely full. Adding a large number of passengers from Suzhou Station, there is sometimes no standing room on the carriage floor. Young people can manage, but women and children suffer. I hope the railway authorities will add Shanghai-Suzhou interval trains to benefit passengers. I hope the Railway Bureau will improve the above two suggestions immediately. (Editor's Note) Mr. Li Ronghua also sent a letter stating that the "Kaixuan" (Victory) train ticket prices between Suzhou and Changzhou were also inappropriate, which is published together.

<p>Reply to Mr. Li Shangwen: Regarding your letter mentioning that the Zhushe (Bamboo House) cannot receive electricity, we have received a reply from the Shanghai Chinese Business Electric Company stating: "Upon investigation, Mr. Li's is a bamboo house. In the past, applying for electric lights was not subject to building permit restrictions. However, on August 1st, we received a letter from the Public Works Bureau through the Public Utilities Bureau, stating that electricity supply should be delayed for those who do not have a temporary shed permit from the Public Works Bureau. Mr. Li applied under the name of Shangwen Store on September 28th, so it was accepted, and the fee was collected first for the convenience of the user to avoid multiple trips. Later, after sending personnel to inspect, it was found that it was a bamboo house, which belongs to the scope of temporary sheds and has not obtained a building permit. According to the bureau's order, the power supply can only be temporarily suspended. If Mr. Li does not intend to obtain a permit, the original payment can be refunded in full upon presentation of the receipt to the company to conclude the matter." Please coordinate.</p>
<h3>The Third National Assembly</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Zhang Ming</p>
<p>— The Preliminary Procedures for Returning Power to the People Have Been Completed —</p>
<p>The weather in Nanjing has taken a sharp turn for the worse. Today, snowflakes filled the city, painting the red buildings with white. The National Assembly archway stood erect in the wind and snow. The delegates attending the meeting still arrived on time, all arriving before nine o'clock.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Government, solemnly submitted this draft Constitution of the Republic of China to the Chairman of the Assembly, Hu Shi, in front of the National Representatives. At this moment of handover, a distinct line was drawn in the history of the Republic of China. This time was 9:45 AM on November 28th, 35th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>When the Chairman of the National Government handed over the draft Constitution to the Chairman of the Assembly, the Chairman of the National Government stood in front of the podium and first handed over the draft Constitution. The temporary Chairman then accepted it from the Chairman's seat. This scene was unprecedented. Many people said, "This is the first time Chairman Chiang has appeared in this posture."</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's report was met with applause more than ten times. The first applause came when the Chairman said, "The National Government is submitting this draft Constitution today, beginning to hand over this responsibility to the people of the whole country, and the people of the whole country will also assume this responsibility from today."</p>
<p>Regarding the May 5th Constitution Draft, Chairman Chiang said, "Standing in the position of the people's representatives, I believe it is no longer applicable. I absolutely support the Constitution Draft submitted by the National Government today." The whole audience responded with even warmer applause.</p>
<p>Today's assembly procedure was only for submitting the draft Constitution and reporting, without discussion, so the atmosphere in the meeting hall was always harmonious. Especially because it was snowing heavily outside and the cold was biting, the air inside the hall seemed warmer. Hu Shi, in the guise of a diplomat, educator, and old professor, served as chairman, allowing him to be more than adequate. It was a pity that the program was simple, and it was truly a case of a hero having no place to use his skills.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Hong's recitation of the draft Constitution was clear and well-prepared in advance. The entire text was read in one breath, with appropriate intonation. The full text was 151 articles, starting at 10:20 and ending at 10:52, taking 32 minutes.</p>
<p>Yu Jiaju had a good interlude, which was also a program that made the conference more colorful. It was the written opinion put forward after the Chairman's report and Hong's official reading of the full text of the Constitution Draft. This was the first voice outside the Kuomintang to express support for the Constitution Draft, and it was also the first cannon fired by various parties since the opening, and this cannon was fired to everyone's delight.</p>
<p>During the break, the delegates went to the lounge for refreshments. Snow was falling heavily outside the window, and everyone shrank their necks and sipped tea. Someone said, "It's like Christmas." The Santa Claus of today brought a gift, a draft Constitution. When the draft was being read, female representative Zhuang Jing solemnly said to reporters, "In the chapter on legislation, the number of legislators is stipulated as five for each province or city with a population of less than three million. If the proportion of women is not specified, there will definitely be no female legislators in the future. We have to fight tooth and nail, at least five to one."</p>
<p>Sun Ke coughed frequently when explaining the draft Constitution.</p>
<p>Lei Zhen resigned from the post of Deputy Secretary-General but was not approved. Today, he was still turning around in the audience. It was not until nearly twelve o'clock that he ran to the stage and sat next to the chairman, flipping through documents.</p>
<p>The mercury lamps were turned on several times today for photography, and the reporters benefited a lot.</p>
<p>When the draft Constitution was being read, most of the audience listened quietly, a small number looked around, and occasionally a few read other newspapers and magazines. Chen Guofu and Hu Shuhua on the stage took notes, while Bai Chongxi supported his bald head with his hand.</p>
<p>At 11:40, the old man Kong Geng walked to the podium with a letter and handed it directly to Secretary-General Hong, repeatedly explaining that it seemed very important. However, reporters were unable to find out the details afterward.</p>
<p>When the hand pointed to twelve o'clock, Chairman Hu Shi stood up and asked the delegates for their opinions on extending the meeting by a quarter of an hour, ending his words with "Okay?" which was very much in the tone of speaking to students.</p>
<p>In the lounge, some hoped that the draft Constitution would be passed unanimously in one go, so they could go home early.</p>
<p>Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party attended today because he was attending the National Assembly for the Constitution.</p>

<h3>Outer Jordan Supported by Britain Attempts to Build a Greater Syria Nation A Struggle Among Arab Nationalities Has Been Aroused Turkey Seeks to Promote Close Ties with Near East Countries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 28th] International disputes, internal hatred, and the ambitions of heroic figures have created various conflicts in the mysterious Arab lands. The ambitious King Abdullah of the independent state of Outer Jordan, supported by Britain, recently ascended the throne. His ambition to connect Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq, and to obtain access to the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian oil fields to create a "Greater Syria Empire" with vast borders, has been reignited. The fierce Saudi Arabia is said to have not hesitated to use force to crush this ambition, and minor battles have reportedly occurred with troops opening into Outer Jordan. The Secretary-General of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs traveled to Ankara today to Outer Jordan to congratulate Abdullah on his accession to the throne, demonstrating spiritual support for the Greater Syria ambition.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 29th] Turkish Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Erkin traveled to Outer Jordan last night to meet with the King of that country, and then went to Beirut to sign several agreements with the Lebanese government. People here are trying to keep this trip of the Foreign Minister secret. Political observers pointed out that after Turkey was forced away from the Balkans by Soviet forces, it is now seeking to promote ties with Near East countries. It is difficult to know whether there has been progress in the establishment of the "Eastern Bloc" sponsored by Britain, but the countries that Turkey wants to approach are all countries with the strongest British influence, namely Iraq, Outer Jordan, and Lebanon, which is also a fact.</p>
<h3>Montgomery Arrives in Palestine This Trip is Purely Military in Nature Internal War in Iran is Imminent</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Jerusalem, 28th] Field Marshal Montgomery, Chief of the British Army General Staff, is inspecting the Mediterranean region and recently arrived here from Cairo. It is reported that Montgomery's trip is purely military in nature.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 29th] Iranian government troops have recently advanced north from Tehran, and it is widely believed that a major offensive against Azerbaijan Province is imminent. Armed farmers and villagers in Azerbaijan Province have already had minor contacts in two locations near the southern Kurdistan border. According to the current situation, it seems impossible for Prime Minister Sultanah's troops to monitor the elections scheduled for December 7th without entering Azerbaijan Province.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 28th] Well-informed sources recently announced that the Iranian government will transfer oil rights to the United States to store kerosene in southern Iran. Storage locations include Baluchistan, Kerman, and part of the Fars region. It is said that American companies have been wanting to obtain this transfer right for many years.</p>
<h3>The Four Foreign Ministers Conference is Full of Compromising Atmosphere</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in New York, 29th] The Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference has reached a definite agreement today on the issues of Trieste and the Danube River. The focus of the discussion will then shift to the issue of $350 million in reparations for the five former enemy countries. If this issue is resolved, the peace treaty with the five countries will surely be resolved smoothly. There are still many difficulties at present, but it is widely believed that the peace treaty with the five countries may be signed before Christmas, and the 14 months of hard work of the four foreign ministers will be successfully concluded.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 29th] The four foreign ministers are excited that the peace treaty may be completed within a week and are working at the highest speed. Today, a showdown has been reached on the issue of the Soviet Union's request for reparations from Italy and Bulgaria, and that Yugoslavia should receive more than Greece.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 28th] After resolving 27 minor disputes and ending the discussion on the treaties with Italy and the Balkans, the four foreign ministers turned to the issue of Danube River navigation in a friendly atmosphere tonight. The Soviet representative agreed with Britain and the United States in principle on the Danube River issue, but requested the insertion of a clause. The United States explained that this clause was intended to prohibit warships from navigating on the river. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin's proposal to invite Greece to participate in the Danube River navigation country conference was also opposed by Molotov.</p>
<h3>Five Countries' Membership Applications The Security Council Reconsiders</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 28th] The Security Council is scheduled to meet on the afternoon of the 29th to discuss the various recommendations made by the UN General Assembly and its various subcommittees. In addition, it will reconsider the membership applications of Albania, Outer Mongolia, Outer Jordan, Portugal, and Ireland. At the same time, Greek representative to the UN General Assembly Dendrimis stated that the Greek government has not yet filed a complaint with the UN Secretary-General regarding the border conflict in northern Greece.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Changes Its Position on Disarmament Case Agrees to International Supervision System But Still Wants to Use the Veto Power as a Talisman</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 28th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov suddenly agreed to implement an international management and supervision system for verifying the reduction of armaments and banning atomic bombs in the UN General Assembly Political Committee today on the most controversial issue of disarmament, which was unexpected. The Soviet Union's original position was to oppose universal inspections. Now Molotov has changed his policy and stipulated that this international management agency should carry out its work under the Security Council because it has the veto power in the Security Council. In his supplementary proposal, Molotov stipulated that in order to ensure the adoption of disarmament and the prohibition of the use of atomic energy for military purposes, the following two committees should be established in the Security Council as special supervisory bodies: (1) managing the implementation of disarmament resolutions, and (2) managing the implementation of resolutions prohibiting the use of atomic energy for military purposes. American representative Connally did not immediately comment on this. British representative Sharkcross explained the British position, stating that the proposed supervisory system must not be affected by the veto power.</p>
<h3>The Ukrainian Representative Was Shot at But There Was No Political Effect</h3>
<p>Bequin replied to Manuisky</p>

<h3>The UN General Assembly Discusses India's Complaint Gu Weijun Delivers a Speech Disapproves of Submitting to the International Court of Justice Advocates for Direct Negotiations Between the Parties</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in New York, 29th] Regarding India's request for the United Nations to take action to stop racial discrimination in South Africa, it is now being studied by the Political Security and Legal Committees. Our representative Gu Weijun spoke in the committee and opposed the proposal that the United Nations agency should send the case to the World Court for legal adjudication as to whether the United Nations has the right to interfere. Gu said that South Africa's discrimination against all Asians concerns the face of the entire Asia and the rights of half of humanity. Therefore, he agrees that the United Nations should decide, and does not agree that the International Court of Justice should adjudicate. It would be even more appropriate if India and South Africa could resume negotiations and seek a solution themselves. Soon, Gu formally proposed a motion requesting that a subcommittee be organized with representatives from India, South Africa, and other countries to study the issue and propose a draft resolution as a basis for the two countries to resume negotiations. The Czech representative expressed full support for this proposal.</p>
<p>Indian representative Mrs. Pandit still requested that the case be decided at the United Nations. She also stated that India's submission of the case was entirely based on a friendly spirit and had no provocative intention. The purpose was to make the world understand that India faithfully believes in the Charter and is willing to implement all the provisions of the Charter as soon as possible so that the future of mankind can be guaranteed.</p>

Torres' nomination as a presidential candidate has been opposed by the People's Republican Party led by Pidou and the Radical Socialist Party led by Heriot, as well as various right-wing parties.</p>

<h3>If the Japanese Reparations Issue is Further Delayed The United States Will Be Forced to Take Unilateral Action The Paulley Report is Distributed to the House of Representatives and the Senate for Reference</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 28th] President Truman distributed the 100 books of the reparations plan proposed by Reparations Commissioner Paulley to the members of the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Foreign Affairs Committee for reference today. The report calls for a severe reduction in Japan's heavy industry to eliminate its military and economic potential. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan's pig iron production will be reduced to 500,000 tons per year, which is about one-fifth of the 1937 level; steel production will be reduced to 2.5 million tons per year.

(3) The manufacture of machine tools will be reduced to 10,000 units per year, but the automotive, leather, textile, and silk industries will remain unchanged.

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] According to this issue of "World Report" weekly, the US government will be forced to take unilateral action on the Japanese reparations issue, directly ordering MacArthur to immediately distribute 20% of the materials allocated by Japan as reparations to the countries requesting reparations. Before the issuance of this order, consultations will still be held with representatives of the countries concerned, but regardless of whether a final agreement can be reached, the United States will insist on immediate distribution. The recommendations made by MacArthur on the distribution situation will be reviewed by the Far Eastern Commission. Even if the Soviet Union objects, MacArthur will still implement it in his capacity as the representative of the main occupying country.</p>

<h3>The Reorganization of the Indian Government (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xiangguang, Special Correspondent in India for This Newspaper</p>
<p>This is the view of both Hindus and Muslims towards the Muslim League's participation in the government. The opinions of us, the third party, may not be definitively determined at this time. We should observe its future developments to understand its true meaning. Later, on the 20th of this month, all parties were eagerly awaiting to see who Jinnah would recommend for cabinet positions. However, after Jinnah announced the five Muslim League members participating in the government, it greatly surprised the Hindus. Among the five Muslim League representatives, one, Jogendra Nath Mandal, belonged to the "Untouchable" class of Hindus. He is currently the Finance Minister of the Bengal Provincial Government and has long had connections with the Muslim League.</p>
<p>It is said that among the "Untouchable" class in India, there have always been two organizations: one belonging to the Congress Party, led by Ram; the other is the Scheduled Castes Federation, led by Mandal. However, for the past twenty years, it has never been recognized by the Congress Party, but has formed an indissoluble bond with the Muslim League. Therefore, Jinnah's recommendation of this person for a cabinet position is to use him to counter the Congress Party's use of Asef Ali (Asaf Ali) to attend the new government. At that time, old man Gandhi also lost his temper, saying that since the "Untouchable" class was recommended by the Congress Party, why would the Muslim League, claiming to represent Muslims, choose a Hindu "Untouchable" representative? It was quite strange. However, Jinnah's move was very clever, winning applause from outsiders. At that time, the Delhi "Hindustan Times" published a cartoon satirizing Islam, which was quite interesting. The cartoon depicted a large hen (i.e., Jinnah) leading out four chicks (i.e., the Muslim League's cabinet representatives), but at the end, there was a duckling (i.e., the "Untouchable" representative), causing the old woman (i.e., the Governor-General) on the side to be greatly surprised! After Mandal, the leader of the Scheduled Castes Federation, was recommended by the Muslim League for a cabinet position, more than a thousand "Untouchables" in Delhi gathered at Jinnah's residence to express their gratitude. Jinnah then gave an impromptu speech, saying, "I am not only your friend, but I will always be your good friend. I will do everything possible to help with the interests of the 'Untouchables'," and so on. Finally, more than a thousand "Untouchables" shouted the slogan "Pakistan! Zindabad!" which means "Long live the Muslim holy land," making the Hindus who saw it both angry and amused.</p>
<p>Now that Muslims are participating in the government, the issue of the allocation of positions in the new government has become the focus of discussion among the Congress Party, the Muslim League, and the Governor-General. Originally, the two Muslims in the new government, one, Zahir, the Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Aviation, and Khan, the Minister of Education and Health, as well as Bose, the Minister of Industry and Mines, resigned at the same time to allow the Muslim League representatives to take their positions. It was previously reported that Jinnah had requested the Governor-General to give the Muslim League the ministries of Foreign Affairs or Interior, Supply or Commerce, Defense or Finance, while giving the Ministry of Industry and Mines to the "Untouchable" representative, Mandal. However, the Minister of Defense belongs to the Sikh religion, Bauder Shen; the Minister of Commerce belongs to the Parsi religion, Bafu; and the Minister of Finance belongs to the Indian Christian religion, Mede. These three ministers all belong to minority ethnic groups and are not easily given up, while the Ministry of External Affairs must belong to Nehru, and the Congress Party is unwilling to give the position of Minister of Interior to the Muslim League. Therefore, the issue of ministerial allocation has become the most difficult problem to solve in the reorganization of the Indian interim government.</p>

<h3>Cold Wave Hits Shanghai, Frozen Corpses on the Streets, Busy Burials at Pushen Cemetery, Relief Work Cannot Be Delayed</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, the climate in this city became even colder, with the minimum temperature dropping to 37.2 degrees. The maximum was only 44.7 degrees. However, the sky cleared up from the afternoon. According to the meteorological station report: the center of the cold wave has reached the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. This morning and evening will still be cold, and the temperature at noon may increase slightly. It is expected that the cold trend will subside after tomorrow. However, another cold wave is predicted to follow soon, around mid-December, and its coldness will set a new record for this year.</p>
<p>Under the severe cold of winter, the poor people feel a serious threat, especially the refugees and beggars who wander the streets without a home. They are scantily clad, starving, and freezing. The number of people who die on the streets is increasing daily. According to news from Pushen Cemetery: the cemetery collected a total of 65 corpses of people who died on the streets the day before yesterday, of which 54 were children's corpses. Yesterday, the number reached more than 70, and most of them were also children's corpses. The burial work these days is extremely busy.</p>
<p>It is only early winter, and the number of people who die on the streets has already exceeded the previous year's record. In the future, when the severe cold is even worse, the situation of the poor freezing and starving to death throughout the winter will be unimaginable. Therefore, winter relief work cannot be delayed. According to news from the Social Affairs Bureau: the bureau has built a winter shelter in Tongzhou Road, Hongkou. It is currently rushing to install water and electricity equipment, and is expected to start accommodating 4,000 refugees by the middle of next month. The Executive Yuan has agreed to allocate the first batch of 800 quilts, 800 sets of cotton clothes, and one bag of flour per person per month. In terms of funding, the Municipal Council has approved the allocation of 900 million yuan for winter refugee relief, but the Social Affairs Bureau has only received 50 million yuan. It is reported that the municipal government will continue to allocate 350 million yuan soon, and the 200 million yuan promised by the central government is also in the process of being approved. In addition, donations from all walks of life are hoped to strengthen the relief efforts.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Meteorological Joint Report is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Siberian anticyclone center is in Northwest and Central China, covering the whole country, Korea, Japan, the East China Sea, the Ryukyu Islands, and the northern part of the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Weather forecast: Yellow Sea, cloudy, clear, cold, with frost, strong northwesterly winds, huge waves. Central China, cloudy, clear, cold, morning fog, moderate northerly winds.</p>
<p>Shanghai, cloudy, cold, with frost, clear, light haze, morning fog, moderate northwesterly to northeasterly winds. East China Sea, overcast, turning cloudy, cold, strong northerly to northeasterly winds, huge waves. Temperature on the 29th: maximum 44.7 degrees, minimum 37.2 degrees.</p>
<h3>Difficult Implementation of New Tax Law, Improvement Expected After Consultation, Director Gu Returns to Shanghai to Talk</h3>
<p>Due to the tax revenue issue in this city caused by the new tax law passed by the Legislative Yuan, Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, went to Beijing to explain to the relevant central authorities and requested reconsideration to suit the local situation. He has now returned to Shanghai. When the reporter went to ask about the consultation process in Beijing, he said: The implementation of the new tax law in this city does have difficulties. Therefore, he went to Beijing to consult with various parties, who all said that methods could be found to improve it. However, because this matter involves the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Interior, it cannot be decided by one person's words. Moreover, Premier Song was busy with official duties and Minister Yu was ill, so they could not have a thorough discussion, so there was no concrete reply. Finally, Gu also denied external rumors that this trip to Beijing was related to the municipal budget, saying that it was not true because the municipal government only needs to report the municipal budget to the Municipal Council and does not need to ask the central government for instructions. Moreover, the rumored shortfall of 200 billion is even more unreliable.</p>
<h3>The Profit Tax of the 34th Year is Too Burdensome for Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>Pan Shihao Says Remedial Measures Should Be Taken</p>
<p>Among the industrial and commercial enterprises in this city that are overwhelmed by the profit tax of the 34th year collected by the Direct Taxation Bureau, there is much complaining. It is heard that the Chamber of Commerce authorities, believing that the deadlock must be broken, have scheduled a symposium to be held at 4:00 p.m. on Sunday. According to Pan Shihao, the simplification of the audit and collection of the profit tax of the 34th year is due to the fact that the budget set by the Ministry does not allow for further reductions, resulting in the saying that 150% of the declared surplus will be taxed. Judging from common sense, the burden on industry and commerce is indeed very heavy, especially since the prosperity of various industries varies. Those who had a surplus at the end of last year may have lost their ability to bear the burden now. Moreover, the so-called tax of 150% of the surplus may not be uniformly applied in practice. It is not surprising that some industrial and commercial enterprises are complaining. However, the Chamber of Commerce's original intention was that since the request for exemption was impossible and the investigation and audit were even more undesirable for all industries, it was a measure to reduce the budget and allocate the tax according to the accounts in the face of necessity. Now that it has been discovered that some industrial and commercial enterprises cannot bear the additional tax because their declared amount was already very large, remedial measures should be taken. According to Pan, industry and commerce are facing increasing difficulties, and various donations and taxes should be changed according to the situation. The two taxes on salaries and interest, in particular, should take into account the strength of the entire people and stop collecting them. Pan also said that if this matter is not resolved satisfactorily, he will go to Beijing to meet with the responsible officials and strive for a solution.</p>
<h3>Ship Leasing Income Tax, The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Request for Exemption</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications, requesting exemption from the ship leasing income tax on the grounds that shipping companies have already paid the first-class profit tax for leasing ships. The cable stated: Leasing ships is one of the shipping companies' own businesses, and if there is a surplus, it has already been included in the first-class profit tax. We implore your ministry to review and approve this matter, and instruct the tax bureau to consult the Ministry of Finance to exempt them from the ship leasing income tax, so that the shipping industry can be at peace.</p>

<h3>Improve Interbank Lending, Promote Lending Bills</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Banking Association invited representatives from national banks and commercial banks to hold a meeting to discuss the following important cases: (1) In order to improve the interbank lending method, the association has repeatedly promoted lending bills. Recently, it intends to add a promissory note from the borrower to the fixed-term loan, and use the drawer's correspondent bank as the payer of the promissory note, which is convenient for exchange and also beneficial for interbank rediscounting. However, a contract must still be signed with the lending bank. It is currently under research. (2) If the draft stub has not arrived, the check cannot be returned according to law. For prudent consideration, the bank may issue a fixed-term draft or a sight draft followed by a fixed-term payment after obtaining the consent of the remitter. This suggestion has been communicated to the industry by the Banking Association in Circular No. 162, and should be followed uniformly.</p>
<h3>Human-Powered Vehicles Converted to Three-Wheelers, Inspection and Licensing to Start Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] In order to eliminate human-powered vehicles in this city, according to the central government's order, it must be completed within two years. At the latest, by the autumn of the 37th year, all human-powered vehicles in this city must be eliminated. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau encourages human-powered vehicle owners to convert them into single-seat three-wheeled vehicles as soon as possible, and has drafted a licensing and taxation method, which is planned to start inspection and licensing from tomorrow. The fees to be collected, in terms of license tax, those who have already paid the human-powered vehicle tax for December will be exempt from vehicle tax after changing to a three-wheeled vehicle license. Those who have not paid the human-powered vehicle tax for December will be allowed to pay one-sixth of the three-wheeled vehicle tax for the second half of the year after changing to a three-wheeled vehicle license, that is, a total of 3,333 yuan for one month in December (calculated as 3,400 yuan). As for the registration, inspection, and licensing part, the cost of the license and various administrative procedures are required. It is proposed to collect a license fee of 7,500 yuan, a registration fee of 1,500 yuan, and an inspection fee of 1,500 yuan, for a total of 10,500 yuan. As for the issuance of vehicle owner certificates and the collection of security deposits, due to insufficient time to handle them, they will be postponed until April 1st of the 26th year, and will be handled together when the vehicles are relicensed, in order to reduce the amount of fees collected this time.</p>
<p>The human-powered vehicles to be eliminated this time, except for those whose owners have only one vehicle, which will not be eliminated for the time being, total 1,944 vehicles. There are already 1,955 vehicles that have applied to the Public Works Bureau to be converted into three-wheeled vehicles. This shows that vehicle dealers have a general understanding of the need to eliminate human-powered vehicles.</p>
<h3>Xu Xueyu Returns to Shanghai to Talk About the Smooth Promotion of Shipping Affairs in Taiwan Province, The Taiwan Shipping Company Will Be Formally Established Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, went to Taiwan last Saturday to inspect the company's business in Taiwan Province and to attend the establishment of the Taiwan Shipping Company. He returned to Shanghai from public affairs on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. He said: In order to develop shipping affairs, the company found that most of the warehouses left by the Japanese in Taiwan that should have belonged to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were badly damaged and unsuitable for use. Therefore, the main task of this trip was to inspect the company's warehouses and design their renovation for application. In addition to setting up a branch office in Taipei, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has also set up offices in Keelung and other places, so the promotion of shipping affairs in Taiwan Province is quite smooth. As for the Taiwan Shipping Company, it is hosted by the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office and has been formally established. Currently, there are only two ships, the Taipei and the Tainan, which regularly sail to various ports in Taiwan Province. Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Taiwan Shipping Company are both state-run institutions, they are specially invited to cooperate. Therefore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is now one of the shareholders of the Taiwan Shipping Company. In addition, General Manager Xu had discussions with the Taiwan Provincial authorities on increasing the transportation of coal and the shipment of Taiwan rice. Currently, 60,000 tons of Taiwan coal come to Shanghai every month. If transportation can be smooth, the amount of Taiwan coal shipped to Shanghai can continue to increase. In addition, in order to save expenses and adjust the order of shipping, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has recently formulated liner schedules for various routes, which will be implemented from next month.</p>
<p>[Another News] The Taiwan Shipping Company held an establishment meeting yesterday and is scheduled to be formally established on New Year's Day next year. The total capital is 10 billion yuan in national currency, 60% from the Taiwan Provincial Office and 40% from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Xu Xueyu will serve as chairman of the board, and Ren Xianqun, director of the Taiwan Provincial Transportation Office, will concurrently serve as general manager. It is reported that regular shipping routes will be opened from Taiwan to Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Qingdao and other places, and transportation between Kaohsiung and Shanghai will be strengthened, and warehouses and loading and unloading facilities in Kaohsiung will be increased to restore Kaohsiung's prosperity.</p>

<h3>Clearing Bayer Factory Inventory, Two-Thirds Completed to Date, Value Exceeds 5 Billion</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The reporter recently visited a person in charge of the Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory Clearance Office and asked about the progress of the office's clearance work. He said that the office received the Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory from the Municipal Health Bureau on November 24th last year. Upon immediate inspection, the inventory was roughly worth more than 2 billion yuan at the time. Two-thirds of the inventory has been cleared over the past year. The proceeds from the clearance have exceeded 5 billion yuan. It is claimed that the office's initial regulations for allocation and distribution did not restrict the sale of medicines with large inventories. Rare medicines were allocated and distributed in combinations, with each combination tentatively priced at 100,000 yuan. The targets for allocation and distribution were divided into two types: (1) Pharmacies in this city that sell Western medicines and apply for allocation and distribution were allocated and distributed according to their business conditions, with first-class pharmacies receiving three combinations, second-class pharmacies receiving two combinations, and third-class pharmacies receiving one combination. (2) Public hospitals in this city with dispensing departments, and hospitals of a charitable nature. Hospitals in other cities must have proof from the local government. The allocation and distribution price was based on the principle of being slightly lower than the market price. On January 13th of this year, the scope of allocation and distribution was expanded, and each combination was increased to 500,000 yuan. The targets for allocation and distribution were expanded to include government agencies and public affairs medical rooms in this city, and registered doctors in this city. At the same time, pharmacies were divided into five levels, from Grade A receiving eight combinations to Grade E receiving one combination. On April 7th, sales venues in other counties were also added. From July 1st, because the quantity of each type of inventory varied, the previously approved allocation and distribution targets were no longer allocated and distributed uniformly, and a bidding method was adopted. At the same time, at the request of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association of this city, the allocation and distribution to pharmacies was still maintained. However, it has been reduced by level, from Grade A receiving five combinations to Grade E receiving one combination. In addition, a special grade was added, giving eight combinations to maintain the actual needs of each pharmacy. In addition, Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory agents in other cities who have had business relations in the past were also given allocation and distribution at the discretion of their business needs.</p>
<h3>Zhoushan Ship Loaded with Smuggled Goods, Rumors Inconsistent with Facts</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Zhoushan ship of the Zhoushan Shipping Company returned to Shanghai from Fuzhou the afternoon before yesterday. There were rumors that the ship was detained for loading a huge amount of smuggled goods. Yesterday, the company claimed that this was inconsistent with the facts. It also said that when the Zhoushan ship was about to leave Fuzhou to return to Shanghai this time, three small wooden boats suddenly approached. An armed person immediately loaded the boats onto the ship. After being rejected by the crew, the armed person said that he had other official business and would arrive soon. The crew believed it to be true and immediately started loading. Later, after being discovered by customs officers, the customs officers did not allow the goods to be shipped because there were no customs procedures, and a dispute arose with the customs officers. As a result, only one small boat was loaded, with only more than twenty wooden boards. The remaining two boats were sent away. The customs officer immediately reported to the Fuzhou Headquarters, and the Headquarters telegraphed Shanghai to inquire. The rumor that the Zhoushan ship was detained was actually inaccurate. As for the wooden boards, they were temporarily unloaded in Shanghai and are being kept by the company. The ship is scheduled to leave for Fuzhou at 4:00 p.m. today.</p>

<h3>Stepmother Abuses Stepdaughter: Father Asks Judge for Leniency</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Guo Yongju, 39 years old from Pinghu, lost his wife five years ago, leaving behind two daughters, the elder named Wu Ying, 14 years old, and the younger named Pin Ying, 12 years old. In 1942, Guo met Lou Qiulan, a hostess, and brought her home as his second wife. Unexpectedly, Lou was naturally violent and often abused the two young girls. Unable to endure the abuse, the two girls requested assistance from the police station on September 30th. The case was subsequently investigated by the District Attorney's Office, which ordered Lou Qiulan to be brought to court on charges of abuse. Yesterday morning, the court session was held, but the stepdaughter did not appear.

<h3>Fire Prevention Propaganda Day Five: Fire Safety Seminar Held</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fifth day of Fire Prevention Propaganda Week. At 3:00 PM, the Fire Department held a fire safety seminar at its headquarters. Deputy Director Yu Shuping, city councilors, and representatives from various district offices attended. Director Yu began by speaking about the significance of fire losses in modern cities, which are dozens of times greater than theft. He hoped for everyone’s assistance in ensuring that fire prevention work achieves its intended goals. Regarding the current difficulties in fire prevention work, there are four reasons: (1) outdated fire equipment, (2) large fire areas and few firefighters, (3) low firefighter salaries, and (4) lack of fire prevention knowledge among citizens. Subsequently, city councilors Fei Shusheng, Wang Jian'e, and others expressed their opinions. The Director of the Fire Department responded, stating that the City Council had approved a budget of one billion yuan for fire prevention, of which 500 million yuan has been approved by the Mayor and is expected to be available by the end of the year, while the remaining 500 million yuan is still pending approval. Regarding fire department discipline, citizens are encouraged to report any violations at any time, and if the evidence is conclusive, severe punishment will be imposed. Regarding the management of street vendors in alleys, the relaxation of alley area restrictions, and the insufficient water supply in Nanshi, the department will gradually improve these issues.</p>

<h3>Jing'an Temple Police Chief Discusses the General Situation of Dividing Police Precincts</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Following the Changshu Road Police Station, the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau in this city has also implemented a police precinct system. A reporter visited Zhou Weiting, the sub-bureau chief, yesterday and obtained a detailed explanation. According to Zhou, the police precinct system is based on Article 11 of the "Outline of Organization for Police Agencies at All Levels," promulgated by the Executive Yuan on July 25, 1936. The police duty of each level of bureau and office should adopt the patrol system in principle and may divide the area into several police precincts as the basic units for police officers to perform their duties. The division of police precincts is based entirely on population density, the prosperity of industry and commerce, traffic conditions, and the cooperation of the Baojia organization. The Jing'an Temple Sub-bureau jurisdiction has a total of 31,651 households, 164,608 people, 35 Bao, and 955 Jia. It has been divided into 217 police precincts. For the sake of implementing duties conveniently, seven police precincts are combined into one joint precinct, for a total of 31 joint precincts. The duty system of the joint precinct is a seven-person, three-shift system, adopting a 4-hour patrol and mutual watch system. The seven police officers are divided into three shifts, with two officers per shift, each shift working for four hours. During the four-hour duty, each police officer patrols for two hours and stands guard for two hours. Every hour, the patrol officers switch positions to alleviate mental strain. Two officers rest, and three shifts take turns. The other police officer rests for the whole day and has one day off every seven days. After the implementation of the police precinct system in the sub-bureau, the following work goals are scheduled within three months: (1) Prevent theft cases from occurring. If they occur, they should be solved as quickly as possible. (2) Clean up the city's appearance. (3) Street vendors should be absolutely prohibited except for designated streets and alleys. (4) Parking areas should be orderly. (6) The household registration should be clear.</p>
<h3>Warner Brothers Smuggling Case: US Navy Concludes Interrogation</h3>
<p>The large-scale smuggling case of American brothers Warner recently involved the US Navy holding a court hearing in Shanghai to interrogate David Warner, one of the suspects, accusing him of using his position at UNRRA during his leave to smuggle large quantities of contraband, including over a thousand pairs of nylon stockings, and conspiring with his father and brothers who run a liquor business in New York, his brother serving in the US Air Force in Berlin, and his brother serving in the US Army in Paris to engage in tax-evading smuggling operations spanning Europe, Asia, and America. David Warner retained US Army Major Shea Er as his defense attorney.

<h3>Korean "Goddess" Dies of Syphilis: Corpse Abandoned on Roadside Due to Lack of Funds for Coffin</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] On the east side of the railway at Songhu Road and Xibaoxing Road, around 6:00 PM on the 24th, a female corpse wrapped in a torn mat was discovered. The deceased was over twenty years old, wearing a printed calico cheongsam, a light green zip-up shirt, white cloth shorts, and tan canvas shoes with brown socks. After being reported to the local police station, the judicial authorities were notified to send personnel to examine the body. It was learned that the female corpse had died of illness. It was also found that the deceased had syphilis and appeared to have been a "goddess" before her death, in a pathetic state. After an investigation by the police authorities, it was learned that the deceased was a prostitute from 46 Zhengxing Lane, Guangdong Street. Wang Debiao, the owner of the brothel, was summoned and stated that there were three Korean prostitutes in the brothel. The deceased was also Korean, known as "Old Drunkard" because of her love of alcohol. Her real name was unknown. The woman had been working as a "goddess" and had only been at the brothel for over ten days, splitting the earnings. She had been infected with syphilis and suffered from severe stomach problems. Her body was weak. She did not receive any customers on the night of the 22nd and went to sleep alone in her room. The next morning at 7:00 AM, Wang Debiao's daughter (named Dongbao, 11 years old) entered the room to sweep and found her lying stiff on the bed, lifeless. Afterwards, due to financial constraints, Wang was unable to afford a coffin and hired two beggars to wrap the deceased in a single quilt, cover her with a torn mat, and instructed them to send her to Pushan Villa, giving them 30,000 yuan as payment. However, they abandoned the corpse on the roadside, and he was unaware of this. The police station, believing that Wang, although unable to afford a coffin due to poverty, abandoned the corpse on the road, which was inhumane, charged him with the crime of abandoning a corpse and submitted the case to the judicial authorities for review.</p>

<h3>The Downfall of Warmongers: Enemy General Okabe Dies of Illness; Commanded Several Major Battles in Changsha and Northern Hubei During the Invasion of China; Suddenly Suffered a Cerebral Hemorrhage and Died the Same Evening</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Japanese General Okabe Naozaburo, an unconvicted prisoner held at the Shanghai War Criminal Detention Center of the First Pacification Area Command in Shanghai Prison, died of cerebral hemorrhage at the prison hospital at 7:15 PM the night before (the 28th). The military court was preparing to bring this major invader of China to trial and impose the punishment he deserved, but he suddenly died of an acute illness. He was fortunate.</p>
<p>Okabe was 60 years old, a native of Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, he served as the Chief of Staff of the North China Expeditionary Army, stationed in Tianjin. In 1939, he was transferred to be the Commander of the Garrison Army in Mongolia, responsible for attacking Zhangjiakou, Shanxi, Suiyuan, and other places. In 1940, he returned to Japan as the Minister of Technology. In 1944, he was transferred to be the Commander of the North China Area Army. When Japan surrendered last year, he was still the Commander of the Sixth Area Army, stationed in Wuhan. The Changsha Campaign and the Hubei-North Hubei-South campaigns, which lasted for years, were all under his main command. After the victory, he was arrested by our government and transferred to the Shanghai War Criminal Detention Center on August 6 this year.</p>
<p>According to the warden of the detention center, Bai Jiaqi, at 2:30 PM on the 28th, the prisoner was still sitting in his room eating, and a guard spoke with him. Unexpectedly, five minutes later, he suddenly fainted. The guard immediately called the doctor to treat him. After examination by Director Chen of Shanghai Prison Hospital, it was diagnosed as a cerebral hemorrhage. An injection was given immediately, and the Japanese Liaison Department was notified to send Dr. Nakayama, a Japanese doctor from the Jinghu Hospital, to assist. After drawing blood and giving injections, his condition stabilized slightly, and he was moved to the ward on the second floor of the prison hospital. Fearing inadequate care, his subordinates Guan Xiansilang, Shibahara Heizaburo, and Nagamura Mitsugu were assigned to accompany and care for him. Dr. Nakayama said that because of excessive bleeding, it would be difficult to save his life, but he would do his best. At 6:50 PM, his condition worsened, and he began to gasp for breath, finally dying at 7:15 PM. He died lying on his back, dressed in military uniform, with his hands crossed on his chest, covered with a floral blanket. This general, who was once powerful and imposing, has now died miserably in prison, which is something that warmongers could not have anticipated.</p>
<p>[Another report] Yesterday afternoon, the District Attorney's Office sent Prosecutor Cao Hong to examine the body.</p>
<h3>Hiding the Assets of Traitor Liang Hongzhi: An Antique Fan from the Qianlong Era; A Leader of the Zhongjiu Army, Chen Mo, Involved in Embezzlement During the Takeover; High Court Prosecutor's Office Initiates Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] After the victory, the takeover work across the country was filled with corruption and irregularities. Although there was an organization for cleaning up takeover teams, they were often powerless due to various reasons and had little effect. Unexpectedly, Chen Mo, the former leader of the Vanguard Corps of the Zhongyi Salvation Army, occupied an antique fan from the Qianlong era belonging to the traitor Liang Hongzhi. He was reported by the Shanghai Office of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization of the Military Commission. After the investigation by the High Court Prosecutor's Office of this city was concluded, he was prosecuted for the crime of hiding traitorous assets. The High Court will hold a trial in the coming days. This is also a "wonderful story" in the history of the takeover.</p>
<p>Chen is 33 years old, from Fengxian County. He was ordered to come to Shanghai after the victory and was also a prominent figure for a time. According to the prosecutor's indictment, on August 20 last year, when Liang Hongzhi went to Beijing to handle the handover, Chen took and hid an antique fan from the Qianlong era, occupying it for himself. He was reported by the Shanghai Office of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization of the Military Commission, and the fan was found in the defendant Chen Mo's home. Liang Hongzhi also testified to this fact on file. Chen claimed that the fan was purchased in Chengdu, which was obviously a deceptive excuse and should not be believed. His actions constitute the crime under Article 12 of the "Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors and Collaborators," and a public prosecution is specially initiated.</p>
<h3>A White Russian Accused of Collaborating with the Enemy to be Sentenced on the 6th of Next Month</h3>
<p>The case of White Russian Shakosky Palkov, accused of collaborating with the enemy by his brother, was heard by the High Court yesterday. The defendant is 47 years old and has lived in this city for many years. During the occupation of Shanghai, he rented the house at 135 Yanqing Road to the enemy to open the Shanghai Chemical and Mineralogical Experiment Institute, which manufactured cobalt oxide for the enemy army. During the trial yesterday, the defendant argued that renting the house to the enemy was unavoidable under the circumstances at the time and that the house was only used as a business office. After the lawyer's defense, the court declared the case closed and set the sentencing date for December 6. The case of Bai Guozhen, the chief of the former Nanqu Police Sub-bureau, was also concluded at the same time, and the sentencing date was also set for December 6.</p>
<h3>Zongyi and Others Interrogated Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Another report] Long Zongyi, who served as the captain of the former Pudong Self-Defense Corps and the adjutant of the former Police Brigade, was initially tried by the High Court yesterday. The defendant was charged with colluding with the deceased former commander of the corps, Xu Hongfa, to persecute patriotic comrades and extort villagers during his term in the former position. During the trial yesterday, the defendant admitted that he held the former position but vehemently denied that he had persecuted comrades or extorted money. In addition, Dong Zhongming, the former head of Ziteng Township in Minhang Town, was previously sentenced to two and a half years in prison by the High Court. The defendant was dissatisfied and, with the approval of the Supreme Court, the case was sent back for retrial. During the retrial by the High Court yesterday, the defendant explained the situation and the forced circumstances when he served as the former head of the township. The hearing was adjourned for further questioning.</p>

In addition to the enemy property portion of the factory being confiscated, the traitorous portion should also be taken into custody, and Chuan Jinkui's crimes will be transferred to the Shanghai High Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3>"To Take Something, You Must First Give Something": A Well-Dressed Young Man Cheats in a City Councilor's Home</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Recently, a new type of fraud has been discovered in this city. On the morning of the day before yesterday, at around 10:00 AM, a young man in a Western suit came to 4 Lane 326 Fudian Middle Road and claimed that he had borrowed 200,000 yuan from the owner of the house, Gao Shu'an (the current city councilor), and had come to repay it. The family members informed him that the owner was out. The young man immediately made a phone call in the house, indicating that he had contacted Gao. He then took out a check for 250,000 yuan from the Nanjing Commercial Bank Shanghai Branch and asked for 50,000 yuan in cash as change. Seeing that he was well-dressed and dignified, the family members did not suspect anything else and paid him the money. It was not until Mr. Gao returned home that he realized he had been cheated.</p>
<h3>Seeking to Resolve Current Difficulties: Tea Merchants Discuss Redeeming Pledged Tea Leaves; Tea Merchant Representatives Visited Lin Fengbao Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shou Jingwei, Sun Xiaocun, and Tang Jisan, prominent tea merchants in this city, and Chen Shoubai, Huang Yantang, Hong Chunzhi, and other representatives from tea-producing areas in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces in Shanghai, visited Lin Fengbao, the Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, at 11:00 AM yesterday to seek ways to resolve the current difficulties in the tea industry and conduct preliminary discussions. The conversation lasted for about an hour. They first discussed the principles of redeeming pledged tea leaves and then the methods of the procurement principles, which were very satisfactory. It is expected that the decision on the redemption method will be made before the procurement is implemented. This issue will be raised at the meeting of the Lending Subcommittee of the Four-Bank Joint Office at 3:00 PM this afternoon, presided over by Director Lin. If a resolution is passed, it will be submitted to the Joint Office for review. It is learned that the procurement of tea leaves nationwide this year is estimated to be about 30 billion yuan, with the output of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces accounting for one-third, and the rest from Hunan, Hubei and Fujian provinces. As for the 85,000 cases of hand-packaged tea leaves in Zhejiang and Anhui, Pinghui tea accounts for 40,000 cases, Tunlu tea for 20,000 cases, and Qimen tea for over 10,000 cases. It is also learned that the government is very concerned about the tea issue. When Minister of Economic Affairs Bu Yunwu came to Shanghai last time, he discussed with Director Lin of the Central Bank the method of procuring this year's tea leaves. After negotiations between the Central Bank and the China Agricultural Corporation, the China Trust Bureau was to purchase Pinghui green tea, and the agreed price was close, but the negotiations were once suspended. From this, it can be seen that the central government has unanimously agreed that this year's export tea leaves should be purchased by the government and exported in a timely manner to compete for overseas markets. However, various tea merchants need to bear black market interest on the funds they have advanced, and the longer it is delayed, the higher the cost. They urgently hope that the authorities can implement the established policy by the end of the Gregorian calendar and purchase box tea from various places. Technical issues such as grading and evaluation will naturally be handled with the assistance of the Tea Trade Association and local representatives.</p>
<h3>Year-End Bonus Issue: Labor and Management Need Understanding</h3>
<p>Recently, a few factory workers have requested year-end bonuses from their employers as the end of the year approaches. This reporter specially visited Zhao Banfu, the Director of the Labor Affairs Department of the Social Affairs Bureau. According to Zhao, the issue of year-end bonuses is a matter of sentiment and not suitable for law. There are no regulations regarding this. However, if the factory can provide year-end bonuses, it can facilitate labor-management coordination. However, the current industrial and commercial downturn this year is also a fact. In short, the issue of year-end bonuses requires understanding between labor and management.</p>
<h3>Lihua Workers Petition for Resumption of Work</h3>
<p>Another report: Over eighty workers from the Lihua Knitting Factory on Yuanle Road marched in a line with small flags in hand to the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday to petition, requesting the factory to resume work. According to the workers' representative, the factory's electricity was suddenly cut off on the 27th. On the 28th, the factory dismissed all workers due to the lack of electricity supply. Therefore, they are requesting the authorities to order the factory to resume work in order to sustain their livelihood. The Social Affairs Bureau instructed Wu to submit a written statement so that mediation could be carried out.</p>
<h3>Nazi War Crimes Trial: to Conclude Before Christmas</h3>
<p>The trial of Nazi war criminals, which will last for three months, has been progressing very actively in recent days. The verbal battles between the two sides are fierce. Nearly twenty witnesses have testified, and there are still fifteen witnesses scheduled to appear to give favorable testimony for the twenty-one Hitler followers. The trial period is expected to last for another two weeks. After the trial is over and the lawyers on both sides have argued, the court can pronounce the verdict. Regardless of whether they are guilty or not, after the trial is completed, if the British and Chinese sides do not conduct trials, the US military may deport them back to Germany for disposal. The reporter visited Major Duar, the prosecutor in the Oertle case, yesterday. According to him, although six of the twenty-seven Nazi war criminals were acquitted, they are still detained in Tilanqiao Prison. The remaining twenty-one are still on trial. The US military hopes to complete the case as soon as possible. In any case, it can be concluded before Christmas. Legally speaking, the Allied forces are punishing criminals in this war crimes trial, but one of the most important points is to make the aggressors aware of their mistakes and to establish a new set of rules for the international community to provide a standard for future generations. This can be called the first attempt in history, and militarists should take heed. After completing this case, Major Duar will go to Tokyo to serve as General MacArthur's legal advisor, appointed by General MacArthur, and is expected to depart at the end of December.</p>
<h3>The China Tobacco Factory: Work Stoppage This Morning</h3>
<p>All employees of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' China Tobacco Factory suddenly went on strike this morning. Upon receiving the news, the Social Affairs Bureau summoned all directors and supervisors of the factory's labor union for discussions. It is reported that the factory workers have raised three demands: (1) Year-end bonuses for male workers should be five months' salary plus one month's double pay; female workers should receive one month's salary based on a base salary of 200 yuan, plus one month's double pay. (2) Change from a daily wage system to a monthly salary system. (3) Future new hires should require the consent of the labor union. The Social Affairs Bureau has stated that the unauthorized strike is not in accordance with legal procedures and instructed the directors and supervisors to persuade workers to resume work within 24 hours. Any requests must be made in accordance with legal procedures.</p>

Participants in these two exhibitions were all first-class painters from Europe or residing in Europe, both living and deceased. Sha Jun had masterpieces included in both, which received favorable comments.</p>
<p>Sha Jun is full of patriotism. After the fall of Brussels, the German propaganda only knew about "Manchukuo," hardly knowing about China. After the restoration, when the art world in Belgium held an exhibition to celebrate, the flags of the victorious nations were hung, but there was no Chinese flag. Sha Jun immediately painted one and sent it to the Brussels Evening News for publication. Last year, the Chinese Embassy in Belgium and overseas Chinese presented President Chiang [Kai-shek] with a [portrait], also by Sha Jun.</p>
<p>Sha Jun has stayed in Belgium for ten years and has recently returned to Shanghai. It is reported that he has been hired by the National Beiping Art School as a professor. (The picture is a recent photo of Sha.)</p>
<h3>Children's Health and Welfare Institute Offers Free Medical Care to Sick Children</h3>
<p>The Taicang Municipal Children's Health and Welfare Institute, in order to promote children's health and widely benefit the children of Taicang, has established a joint free day and night clinic at its main hospital at No. 10, Lane 173, East Baoxing Road, North Sichuan Road, in accordance with the provisions of its organizational regulations. Chairman Pan has sent letters to prominent pediatricians in the city, inviting them to take turns providing voluntary consultations on a daily basis. Huang [omitted], Director of the Health Bureau, Zhang Wei, and prominent pediatricians Su Zufai, Su Zengxiang, and Song Mingtong will preside over and promote the clinic. It is scheduled to open on December 5th, with consultations held daily from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, including Sundays. Children under the age of twelve can receive completely free medical care.</p>
<p>The institute's fundraising campaign has been extended to December 5th.</p>
<h3>Reader Consultation: Medicine and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Schistosomiasis</p>
<p>A friend from Pudong, Mr. [omitted], had a blood test that showed an increase in eosinophils. It is said that this may be caused by Japanese schistosomiasis parasites in the body. I have several questions and would appreciate it if you could answer them in the medical consultant column of your newspaper: (1) Can an increase in eosinophils determine that there is indeed schistosomiasis parasitism in the body? Can other diseases also cause an increase in eosinophils? (2) What method can be used to determine that one is indeed suffering from schistosomiasis? (3) How long is the incubation period for this disease? What are the symptoms during the incubation period? (4) What are the consequences if this disease is not treated? (5) How does schistosomiasis enter the human body? (6) If one is sure that one has this disease, is "Shiniyi [omitted] Antimony" effective? Can people without the disease be injected with it?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Gu Yuqi, Doctor of Medicine] (1) An increase in eosinophils in the white blood cell classification does not necessarily mean that there are Japanese schistosomiasis parasites in the body. According to pathology, there are the following possible diseases that can cause an increase in eosinophils: various parasites in the intestines (such as roundworms), bronchial asthma, malaria, and Japanese schistosomiasis, etc. (2) Examination of stool and detailed medical history, followed by a detailed examination of the whole body. (3) The incubation period of this disease is very long. Two to three weeks after the human body is infected with this parasite, one feels tired, has an abnormal appetite, and a slight fever. Sometimes, swelling of the liver and spleen can be found. Four to five weeks after infection, when the female worms begin to lay eggs, there is initially a slight fever, followed by chills and high fever, either remittent or intermittent, sometimes lasting for several days or even ten days. After several days, there is a specific tenesmus and mucus in the stool, which contains a large number of eggs. Therefore, many eggs can be seen by examining the stool. (4) If this disease is not treated, the liver will develop cirrhosis, the intestinal mucosa will atrophy and necrose, and the portal system will have congestion, digestive disorders, ascites, and congestive splenomegaly, eventually leading to malnutrition or excessive ascites, and then to systemic weakness and death. (5) Schistosomiasis is transmitted through the skin, not through the mouth. If the skin of humans or mammals comes into contact with the intermediate host of schistosomiasis (a small snail) and the developing Cercaria for a period of time, it will be invaded and infected. (6) If one is sure that one has this disease, Neostibosau can be used. People without the disease should not be injected with it.</p>
<p>(2) Nosebleeds</p>
<p>Huang Xiong asks: I have had nosebleeds since I was a child. They come and go. Sometimes there is a lot of bleeding. After stopping the bleeding, it comes out of my mouth again. I recently had an X-ray, which said that my lungs were normal, but my trachea had a slight problem. I would like to ask: (1) What is the cause of this disease? How should it be treated? (2) My lungs are normal, but I have a small amount of phlegm (without coughing). Why? What is the treatment? (3) I have trachoma. What is the best treatment? (4) What are the harms of having a long foreskin? How should it be treated?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Gu Yuqi, Doctor of Medicine] (1) The nosebleeds are probably caused by chronic rhinitis or vitamin C deficiency. A detailed examination is needed to determine the cause. (2) Whether there is a problem with the lungs can be diagnosed with an X-ray. If there is no lung disease but there is phlegm, it is probably chronic tracheobronchitis. (3) Whether you have trachoma should be diagnosed by an ophthalmologist. (4) A long foreskin can easily lead to nocturnal emission. Surgery can be performed at any municipal hospital.</p>

<h3>Cooking Oil Prices Fall into Negotiated Pricing; Manufacturers Willing to Sell at Lower Prices; Mayor Satisfied with the Distribution Situation in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Cooking oil prices have been falling for days. Yesterday, hoarders released even larger quantities from their warehouses, offering rapeseed and sesame cooking oils, totaling about 2,000 dan [unit of weight]. The market price subsequently collapsed. Rapeseed oil was 135,000 yuan, and soybean oil was 130,000 yuan, falling greatly into negotiated pricing. Cooking oil allocated by the Joint Distribution Office was rarely inquired about. Oil pressing factories believe that production is increasing daily, but sales channels are narrowing daily, resulting in increasing inventory that not only ties up capital but also incurs interest expenses. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a meeting was convened at the Oil Factory Association to discuss coping measures. Xie Yuxiang of Dayouyu, Xue Chengzhang of Weimin, and Zhang Chao of the Joint Distribution Office were selected to meet with Section Chief Ji Mingqi of the Food Department of the Social Affairs Bureau to provide input: It is hoped that the Social Affairs Bureau will allow the oil factories to adjust allocation prices according to the market within negotiated pricing, so that the negotiated price allocation will not be unsalable when the market price is lower than the negotiated price. The Social Affairs Bureau expressed great satisfaction with the factories' voluntary offer to lower cooking oil allocation prices according to market prices and readily approved it. This measure can be implemented starting today. Therefore, it is expected that today's cooking oil allocation price will be lower than the negotiated price.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all of the more than 1,400 registered retailers at the Joint Distribution Office have been fully allocated. The second allocation will begin today. Starting next week, the office will allocate based on the actual retail sales volume of each retail store to reflect the actual situation. It is also reported that Mayor Wu inspected several cooking oil retail stores in Jiangwan a few days ago. He inquired in detail about the source, price, and retail price of the allocated cooking oil. As a result, he believed that the office's handling of the oil allocation procedures was in accordance with regulations and achieved remarkable results.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Reaches 4,900; Gold Breaks Through 2.7 Million</h3>
<p>Gold prices still rebounded yesterday, mainly due to tight supply and strong actual sales. The opening price in the morning was 2,658,000. Sellers with financial needs sold, and buying interest was weaker, causing prices to fall. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 50 bars at a price of 2,640,000. Afterwards, demand increased on dips, and prices gradually rebounded from within 2,640,000. Buying interest rose again, and supply decreased. Near noon, prices rebounded to around 2,685,000 before leveling off slightly. At noon, prices hovered around 2,680,000. In the afternoon, those with next-day settlement bought without selling, breaking through the 2.7 million mark and closing at a high price, up 48,000 from the previous close. Gold ornaments were priced as high as 288,400. Silver ingots and silver dollars were flat, and the black market discount remained at around 15%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were slightly more active yesterday. The retail market price for the US dollar was still 3,500 yuan to 3,530 yuan. The black market opening price in the morning was 4,750 yuan to 4,800 yuan, rebounding to above 4,850 yuan mid-day, slightly falling back at noon. After being driven up by the gold market in the afternoon, it also passively rose to close at 4,900 yuan, up more than 100 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars had limited transactions and remained relatively stable. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose from 930 yuan to 940 yuan with buying interest. The Indian exchange rate was around 1,140 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 15,100 yuan with supply, but transactions were limited. The US exchange rate remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Slightly Rise; Soybean Oil Recovers Slightly by 1,000-2,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total rice supply to the northern and southern rice markets was more than 10,000 shi [unit of volume]. Retail sales by shops were relatively strong. Southern japonica rice rose by more than 1,000 yuan, and northern japonica rice also rose by 1,000 yuan. Indica rice was quite popular. White glutinous rice arrivals and sales were both sluggish and still scarce [omitted]. Soybean sales were sluggish, still hovering weakly, and continued to recover slightly by 300-500 yuan. Soybean cake sales were average, and prices were mediocre. Flour prices were temporarily fixed. Flour sales were stagnant. Broad beans were as before. Sesame from Guangdong continued to arrive, and the market was quite strong. Raw peanuts were selectively purchased on the street, with high prices for good quality and stagnant prices for poor quality. Fava beans rose slightly by 200-300 yuan. Mung beans continued to be handled in Southeast Asia, and the market trend was stable. Corn was stable. The supply and demand of the oil market remained stable. Soybean oil recovered slightly by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil was flat, and vegetable oil was also [omitted]. Rapeseed and sesame oil were flat. Goods from Hankou, Bengbu, and Northeast China continued to arrive, and oil prices were temporarily trending towards stability.</p>
<h3>North Africa Needs Chinese Tea; Obstructed by Undetermined Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to tea industry representatives, Europeans and Americans place great importance on tea, a daily necessity, especially in French Africa, where its importance is almost like rice for us. They have relied on China for supply for years. However, after the end of the war, transactions have failed to revive for various reasons. The main reason is that the exchange rate has not been officially determined. For example, recently, they planned to telegraphically transfer a huge sum of francs to various banks in Shanghai, but due to the aforementioned reasons, there was no recipient for a while. Observing the current situation, at a time when the Chinese tea crisis is becoming increasingly serious, it is hoped that the government will provide timely solutions.</p>
<p>In the foreign tea market, sellers continued to actively sell. Although there is still demand for Chinese tea abroad, the prices offered are harsh. Therefore, exporters are unwilling to actively purchase, and transactions remain weak. Domestic sales of red and green tea show no signs of improvement, and the process is quiet and bleak.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Indian Yarn Arrive in Hong Kong; Prices Cheaper Than Shanghai Market</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong, 29th] Five million pounds of Japanese yarn, approved for export by the General Headquarters of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan, have arrived in Hong Kong. A large quantity of Indian cotton yarn has also arrived. It is reported that Indian cotton yarn will be dumped in South China at prices far cheaper than those in the Shanghai market and is also trending towards export to various ports in Southeast Asia.</p>
<h3>Factories with Less Than Three Months of Cotton Inventory Will Be Approved for Foreign Exchange Purchases; National Factory Cotton Consumption Will Reach 9 Million Dan Next Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to textile experts, the number of spindles in operation in our country is currently only about 2.5 million. Starting next year, as the spindles in Northeast China are gradually repaired and put into operation, it is expected that this number will gradually increase to 3 million or 3.5 million spindles. Ordinary coarse yarn spinning requires 3 dan to 3.5 dan of raw cotton per spindle per year, while fine yarn spindles require about 2.5 dan. Assuming an average of 3 dan per spindle, and with 3 million spindles as the national standard, it is estimated that the raw cotton required for spinning in our country next year will be about 9 million dan. However, in reality, the spindles in each factory cannot operate all year round, and there are often shutdowns or lack of power in each factory. Therefore, this amount of cotton consumption still needs to be discounted accordingly. It is now heard that the authorities will approve foreign exchange purchases of American cotton for factories with less than three months' worth of cotton inventory. At the same time, they must purchase domestic cotton in a certain proportion to promote it. However, since the Sixth District Yarn Factory Association began registering the cotton inventory of its member factories, only more than 70 have reported so far. It is hoped that those factories that have not yet reported will fill out the forms as soon as possible to facilitate the process.</p>
<h3>Dragon Head Cloth Nears 100,000</h3>
<p>Cloth sales in various places are still strong, mainly because the number of Textile Reconstruction [cloths] for sale is limited, resulting in a tightening of [available cloths] on the market. The prices of various cloths have reached new highs. Dragon Head fine cloth is about to break the 100,000 mark. Because dyeing and weaving factories expect strong sales of dark-colored cloths and are unwilling to sell, dark-colored Shilin [cloth] has risen by another 3,000 yuan. Fine cloth and Four Gentlemen drill [cloths] have also risen by 2,000 yuan to 2,500 yuan. Jinbang Le'an an blue cloth has suddenly risen by more than 10,000. Inventory is depleted, and the prices of all cloths are rising.</p>
<h3>Current Production of the British Spinning Industry</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Lancashire needs to produce 1.82 billion pounds of yarn annually to meet the national economic plan and achieve the goal of increasing exports by 75% compared to 1938. In the five-month period from April to August of this year, production was 730 million pounds per year. After meeting domestic demand of 700 million pounds, there is a surplus of 30 million pounds for export. The industry is confident that it can make up for this shortfall, but various obstacles, such as outdated machinery, uneconomical operations, and lack of raw materials, must be overcome.</p>
<h3>Trade with the Soviet Union Difficult to Develop; Due to Low Prices Offered by the Soviet Side</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Sino-Soviet trade is currently being promoted gradually. It is heard that the biggest difficulty is that the Soviet Union is offering too low prices. For example, the Soviet Commercial Representative in China has contacted several times to ship our country's brick tea. In the end, the deal could not be concluded because the price offered was too low. As for goods such as tung oil, raw silk, and hog bristles exported to the Soviet Union in recent years, they are used to offset our country's past debts to the Soviet Union. This work was originally undertaken by the Fuxing Company. Since 1939, it has been undertaken by the Central Trust Bureau. Each year, valuables worth approximately US$11 million are shipped to the Soviet Union to pay off the debt. It is estimated that it will not be fully paid off until 1952.</p>
<h3>5,000 Boxes of Tea Shipped to Europe Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] A large shipment of tea was sent to Europe. The Songdan, the first French postal ship to return to Shanghai, left Shanghai yesterday for France, carrying more than 5,000 boxes of tea. This is a new record for the amount of tea exported from the Sino-European route after the victory, but it is still very small compared to before the war. In addition, the Haiyong ship sailed to Tianjin with 2,150 bales of cotton, which were reported by the China Textile Corporation. There were also 100 tons of medicines, which were the goods of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, transported to Tianjin for transshipment to Peking.</p>
<h3>Overproduction of Flour; Allotment Sales Insufficient; Manufacturers Apply for Purchases or Export Permits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Since resuming production, the five major flour mills in this city, including Fufeng, Fuxin, Huaying, Yutong, and Maoxin, have been providing 12,000 bags of flour daily for allocation and sale at negotiated prices. However, recently, due to sluggish flour prices, only a few thousand bags of allocated flour are picked up each day. However, the normal production volume of the five factories is about 80,000 bags per day. If they only produce flour for allocation and sale, operating for five days a month is enough to meet the city's allocation needs for one month. However, under the current circumstances, even the production volume for these five days cannot be fully allocated. Therefore, there is no way to sell the extra production volume. The factories are all feeling the burden of tied-up capital and wasted interest expenses. As a result, they have no choice but to stop production. However, the workers' wages are still calculated on a monthly basis. It is now heard that the factories are applying to the municipal government to have the surplus flour purchased by the Food Department, or to allow them to export it, or to dispose of it in other reasonable ways, in order to alleviate the flour factories' difficulties.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Allocates Artificial Silk to Both Local and Out-of-Town Applicants</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau allocated artificial silk for the thirteenth time on the 28th. The prices remained unchanged. The ribbon weaving industry has already allocated this month's allocation in the twelfth [round]. In addition, the amounts for the dyeing and weaving, knitting, and electrical machinery industries for this month were also allocated yesterday. A total of 88 dyeing and weaving companies applied and were allocated 135 and a half cases. 80 knitting companies were allocated 50 and a quarter cases. 119 electrical machinery silk weaving companies were allocated 237 and a quarter cases. A total of 423 cases were allocated. The artificial silk allocated yesterday was of the Early Japan and Toyo types. The Early Japan price was 2.75 million per case, and the Toyo price was 2.77 million per case. In addition, for the next month's needs, the ribbon weaving industry requires a total of 76 companies, requesting 431 cases. Hangzhou needs 400 cases next month, and Shengze needs 120 cases. The Central Trust Bureau will allocate all of these.</p>
<h3>Import Applications Extended; The Import Association Issued a Notice Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Management Committee recently issued a notice yesterday in response to repeated requests from importers to extend the registration dates for various applications: (1) The registration date for import applications has been extended to December 9th of this year. (2) Regarding Appendix 1 type imports that have not yet been imported before November 17, 1946, and whose value exceeds US$2,000 (or equivalent currency value), the application registration procedures for their purchase contracts have also been extended to December 9th of this year. (3) Before new measures are formulated, the import of domestic goods is not limited to registered importers.</p>
<h3>42-Count Yarn Reaches 5.2 Million; Next Month's Yarn Allocation Schedule Has Been Set; Payment Deadline to Be Determined by Each Factory and the Re-Allocation Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, the yarn market saw a further surge. Inland buyers, eager for spot goods, were willing to pay high prices to purchase. Sellers were unwilling to sell rashly and insisted on a high price. As a result, 20-count yarn continued to rise by 40,000-50,000. Fine yarn was particularly outstanding. Although Silver Moon 32-count was priced at 3.05 million, Blue Phoenix once rose as high as 3.25 million, but it was not easy to obtain. 42-count Police Line rose again to 5.2 million, but it was already at the end of its run. Buyers were scarce, and many were retreating in the face of difficulties.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The dates for the four allocations of cotton yarn jointly distributed by national and private factories in this city for December have been set as the 2nd, 9th, 17th, and 25th. The payment deadline for each allocation will be determined by the factories distributing cotton yarn and the expanded distribution meeting of the Re-Allocation Committee. Factories in the Re-Allocation Committee that are unable to receive the allocated yarn after payment can deduct interest on a daily basis. In addition, the allocation of 1,500 pieces of yarn for other retailers will also be distributed in four allocations according to the above dates.</p>
<h3>Hoarders Drive Up Silk Prices; China Silk Corporation Releases 70 Dan</h3>
<p>The silk market, which had been quiet for a long time, suddenly surged this week. Since the beginning of the week, 20/22 denier Grade D raw silk has risen from 3.4 million yuan per dan to beyond the 4 million yuan mark. However, market conditions abroad have been trending downwards. This abnormal market trend is clearly due to hoarders deliberately driving up prices. Just as silk weaving industry loans were about to be disbursed, the raw materials stored by the silk weaving factories were insufficient. Therefore, after obtaining the loans, the factories had to absorb as much as possible for use. This led to general raw silk hoarders believing that there was an opportunity to take advantage of and raise prices. On the previous day, the China Silk Corporation purchased and transferred 70 dan of D-grade 20/22 denier raw silk, which it had acquired on behalf of the Central Trust Bureau, to various silk factories for a price of 3.95 million yuan in national currency. Since this batch was released for sale, general hoarders have gradually become less conspicuous. Yesterday, prices gradually returned to normal, with D-grade raw silk opening at 3.8 million yuan per dan. Chengfeng Silk Weaving Factory in this city ordered 15 dan of special coarse 40/42 denier Grade D raw silk from Yongtai Silk Factory for a price of 4.05 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>More Than 30 Loans Approved by the Four Joint Banks</h3>
<p>The Four Joint Banks held a board meeting on the afternoon of the 28th and approved more than 30 cases, including the national banks undertaking rediscounting or re-mortgaging for legally reorganized provincial banks, and loans for the Zibo area industrial and mining industry in Shandong Province and the cotton import financing for the Yunnan Textile Factory. It also approved the establishment of the Guangdong-Guangxi Region [omitted] Loan Consortium. The committee approved 2.7 billion yuan in production loans and 6.3 billion yuan in transportation and sales loans, totaling 9 billion yuan. These would be handled in accordance with the precedent set by the Shanghai and Chongqing Region Banking Consortiums.</p>
<h3>Licenses of Enemy and Puppet Companies Must Be Reissued by the End of the Year</h3>
<p>Regulations were previously issued for the registration of various companies in the recovered areas. Companies that had a business license during the period of enemy and puppet occupation, and whose licenses were stamped or marked with other characters by the enemy or puppet regime, could have their licenses reissued by the competent local authorities after submitting them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. The original deadline for this reissue procedure was the end of June of this year, but it has now been extended to the end of this year. It has been decided that there will be no further extensions after this.</p>
<h3>Industrial Raw Materials Must Be Protected from a Flood of Arrivals</h3>
<p>The raw material market is like a speculative scene. Once someone inquires about raw materials with thin inventories, prices immediately rise sharply. The prices of three acids (sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and nitric acid) have risen two to three times. Baking soda and soda ash have also risen sharply. The price of carbolic acid was more than 300 yuan per pound a month ago. Although it gradually increased afterwards, it was at most 500-600 yuan. Now it has suddenly risen to 4,400 yuan per pound. Zinc powder was previously sold at low prices due to the abundance of goods on the market, but recently it has also become scarce and expensive. Although high prices are offered for goods that have risen, it is impossible to find them anywhere. As a result, raw material merchants who were on the verge of collapse have suddenly become active. However, according to industry insiders, after a large number of American raw materials were imported in March of this year, raw material prices have remained stagnant until now. It is expected that more foreign ships will arrive in December, and the imported raw materials will be more than in March. Therefore, the high profits of raw material merchants may not be sustainable.</p>
<h3>Bank Lending for Arbitrage; Securities in a State of Flux</h3>
<p>The official rate declined slightly yesterday. The consolidated "C" (統丙) opened in the morning at $1420. Major players in the industry, such as Chen Teh (誠德), recognizing unfavorable conditions in the securities lending market, sold off shares, causing the price to fall below $1310 before stabilizing. It struggled to stay above $1350 at the close, mainly because miscellaneous brands were still being bought up by Room 604, maintaining a sense of stability. Cotton futures (紡果) closed down by $80 for each of Grades A, B, and C compared to the previous close. The consolidated "D" (統丁) dropped a small $70, and the consolidated "E" (統戊) fell by $50. The total transaction volume was approximately $5 million.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks initially fell but then recovered yesterday, with banks engaging in arbitrage activities, providing supply in the spot market. There was a large influx of bank funds for absorption, making it impossible for short sellers to operate. Around noon, there was a scramble to cover positions, causing the price to rise. The morning opened steady, and short sellers attempted to exert pressure, selling Nos. 89 and 36, which led to new lows. However, arbitrage activities by No. 207 helped maintain the price. Nos. 4, 176, 231, 142, and 38 successively covered their positions, gradually pushing the price higher. Around 10:30 AM, persistent pressure in the spot market, with Nos. 229, 152, and 169 selling, revealed weakness. At this point, the spot and futures prices differed by as much as $10, and New Asia Transportation (新業交通) engaged in low-interest arbitrage. As a result, the pressure in the spot market was absorbed, and confidence gradually stabilized, leading to a gradual rise. Nos. 232, 177, and 109 bought in, while Nos. 180, 89, and 149 cautiously covered their short positions, further driving the price upward. The market became more firm near noon. As a result, popular stocks like Wing On Spinning (永紗), Sincere Co. (信和), and New Kwong (新光) each rose by half a percent compared to the previous close. King Fook (景福), China United (勤興), and Wah Fung (華豐) saw slight gains, while Mayer &amp; Co. (美亞) increased by about ten percent. Among the less popular stocks, China Textile (中紡), Rong (榮), Tung Yih (統益), China Silk (中絲), and Five Harmony (五和) all experienced slight declines. The rest rose by about half a percent. In deferred delivery, Wing On Spinning, Mayer &amp; Co., and China United each rose by half a percent, Sincere Co. was slightly stronger by half a percent, King Fook remained flat, and New Kwong and Wah Fung saw slight gains. In the afternoon, new buying suddenly quieted down, creating a wavering situation with inadequate support. Although sellers were few, sentiment remained uncertain. Canton brokers, such as No. 184, sold, which easily caused declines, but No. 173 and others absorbed at lower prices, providing support. There was a slight upward movement near the close. As a result, Wing On Spinning and New Kwong rose slightly compared to the previous close, Mayer &amp; Co., Sincere Co., and Wah Fung each rose by slightly less than half a percent, King Fook remained flat, and China United declined slightly. Among the less popular stocks, Wing On Public (永公) rose by slightly less than ten percent, cement fell by ten percent, and the rest saw mixed ups and downs. Outside the market, various stocks saw slight increases.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks saw stability in Ewo Brewery (怡啤), Jardine Matheson (業廣), and Shanghai Land Investment (尙形), while the rest were unable to sustain due to excessive sales after being held for a long time. As a result, Jardine Matheson remained flat compared to the previous close, Ewo Brewery rose slightly, Shanghai Cotton fell by half a percent, and the rest saw slight declines.</p>

<h3>Schools in This City Affected by the War Petition for Loans to Rebuild</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Sixty-six private primary and secondary schools in this city were destroyed or suffered losses during the War of Resistance. Sun Yuan, principal of Patriotic Girls' Middle School (愛國女中), Yu Yu of Southeast Women's Physical Education Teachers College (東南女體師), and representatives from 16 other schools petitioned the Executive Yuan, the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Bureau of Education to allocate enemy and puppet properties to be used as school buildings, but none of these petitions were granted.

Now, each school is petitioning the Municipal Bureau of Education to forward their request to the Executive Yuan, requesting loans from the National Bank to restore their schools or rebuild school buildings. The loan requests are divided into three categories: (1) Those partially destroyed request loans of 200 to 300 million yuan, (2) Those completely destroyed request loans of 400 to 500 million yuan, (3) Those completely destroyed and not yet restored request loans of 500 to 600 million yuan.

<h3>A Record of the Demeanor of Over Twenty Representatives at the United Nations General Assembly</h3>
<p>— New York Air Mail Dispatch, October 31st, Our Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, a political scientist once said: Diplomacy is an art, not a science. A successful diplomat does not rely on formulas in books, but on momentary wit and natural talent. At this United Nations General Assembly, I listened to speeches by more than twenty chief representatives. The most successful, in my opinion, was the Indian representative, Mrs. Pandit.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pandit's Speech Was the Most Successful</p>
<p>At the San Francisco Conference, Mrs. Pandit was not yet qualified to be a representative. She was an Indian citizen engaged in political activities throughout the United States to fight for India's freedom and independence. Now that India's autonomy has been initially achieved, this sister of Chairman Nehru, wearing a water-red Indian dress, is receiving unanimous support from the United Nations.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pandit has a "weather-beaten" face, graying hair, and a medium build. Her English is very clear in every syllable, although there is a bit of an Indian accent mixed in, it is not annoying to listen to. She reads from her prepared speech, and the ending of each paragraph is very light and concise. This is completely opposite to the American representative, Austin. Austin speaks like an actor, his voice is very sonorous, and the conclusion of each paragraph is very loud, often winning applause from the audience with his loud tone.</p>
<p>Austin's Speech Is Like Wind Sweeping Fallen Leaves</p>
<p>It is said that President Truman chose Austin to be the chief representative because he can "speak." He is one of the most inflammatory speakers in the Senate. His intonation is very distinct. When he reads his speech, sometimes it is like the wind sweeping fallen leaves, reading more than ten sentences in one breath. Sometimes, he pauses for more than ten seconds between each word. His voice is like a booming bell, unlike Varnas, whose voice is full of "sand," nor is it like Truman's, whose tone is weak. Many American listeners are disgusted by Austin's excessive "dramatics," but most Americans still find his speeches "enjoyable."</p>
<p>Sir Baggall Possesses a Gentlemanly Demeanor</p>
<p>The British representatives, who are the epitome of gentlemanly demeanor, also have their lovable aspects. They attend meetings diligently, never missing a session. When they attend, they listen attentively from beginning to end. Foreign Minister Bevin did not come, and Sir Baggall still represented the United Kingdom, and his demeanor was the same as it was during the London conference in January. When he read his speech, the content criticized the Soviet Union, but his face never looked towards the Soviet side. At this General Assembly, the seats of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union were all in the first row. The United Kingdom and the United States sat side by side on the left. The Soviet Union was in the middle of the first row, on the right. To the left of the Soviet seat was Uruguay, and to the right was Venezuela.</p>
<p>Every representative who finished speaking and left the stage had to pass in front of the seats of the United Kingdom and the United States. Sir Baggall would always stand up and shake hands warmly, to celebrate the success of the other party's speech (except for Molotov). Baggall shook hands warmly with Mrs. Pandit, and when he shook hands with Dr. Gu Weijun, there was an indescribable feeling of cordiality.</p>
<p>Dr. Gu Weijun's Words and Actions Are All Appropriate</p>
<p>In terms of speaking skills and demeanor, I think Dr. Gu Shaochuan's speech this time (October 28) was 100% successful. He stood up straight, and his walking, movements, and the use of his hands were all very appropriate. His English pronunciation was melodious and clear, and every sentence and every word was able to convey its meaning. What is especially commendable is that other representatives read their scripts from beginning to end, their faces not facing the audience. Although Gu Shaochuan also looked at the script, he memorized the first and last paragraphs. The beginning and the end are the keys to a successful speech. This is, in any case, the crystallization of decades of experience.</p>
<p>However, the speech of the Chinese representatives has no status in this entire conference. Why? Because what we say has no content. Apart from singing praises of "peace clichés," it is simply impossible to say a concrete word about China's internal and external situation today. I remember that in January of this year, when the first United Nations General Assembly was held in London, a reporter from The Times of London wrote: "Dr. Gu Weijun is eloquent, but his content is empty." This time, we are still making the same mistake. The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune published the full text of Molotov's speech and Austin's speech in full pages. The speeches of Belarus and Mexico were also published in considerable detail. However, The New York Times used only two sentences to describe Gu Shaochuan's speech lightly. The New York Herald Tribune: "Next, the Chinese representative spoke, and there was nothing special to record in the content, but one thing was quite interesting, and that was that Dr. Gu Weijun reiterated the international control of nicotine" (note: nicotine in opium red pills, a kind of narcotic).</p>
<p>The South Representative's Speech Causes the Audience to Doze Off</p>
<p>What is the exact opposite of Gu Weijun's style is the South Slav chief representative Xue Mishu, this old man with a hunchback, wearing a black dress, standing and reading his French script for a full hour. The representatives, reporters, and audiences upstairs who were playing chess almost fell asleep. Many small countries in South America, such as Guatemala, Nicaragua, etc., have always been uninterested in meetings, and they have long since slipped away. People like Mrs. Roosevelt were reading newspapers (Mrs. Roosevelt flipped through the New York Post while Gu Weijun was speaking). Many reporter old masters were not interested in this old man from Yugoslavia. Some were chatting, some were playing chess, and some were drawing tic-tac-toe. Because I was drawing tic-tac-toe with an American reporter, I knocked over a chair in the reporter's seat, and the whole audience paid attention to it.</p>
<p>However, such an old man, such a lecture like a monk chanting scriptures, its content is very sharp and mean. His United Nations General Assembly reporter was more humorous. He said that he condemned Britain's behavior in Greece, advocated reserving the veto power, and also involved the issue of the US military stationing in China. Everyone realized this deeply when the translator translated it into English.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Representative Looks Like Hu Shi</p>
<p>A longer speech than the South Slav representative's was given by the old New Zealand diplomat, Brand St., who gave a speech of nineteen pages. His speech was full of scholarly demeanor, and he also looked somewhat like Hu Shi. This New Zealand representative started from the creation of the world, one thing at a time, and then analyzed the importance of peace and the unreasonableness of the "veto power" of the five major powers. He advocated abolishing the "veto power."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the veto power issue became the central theme of this conference. Secondly, it is the issue of foreign troops residing in the territory of non-enemy countries, and thirdly, it is the issue of Jews and Palestine. Among these three major issues, the first two are naked, and the last one is looming. The first two issues can be roared loudly, and people can be scolded with a flushed face. Everyone is unwilling to mention the latter issue clearly, and they all use "overtones" to express it. The opposition of the front two issues is simple. The latter issue is not only complicated, but will also immediately affect the US election on November 5.</p>
<p>The first person to expose the Jewish issue was Truman's opening remarks. He said that regardless of race, the United Nations should send anyone who is homeless back to their homeland. He also said: "I will do my best to get Congress to pass a bill to allow such people to immigrate to the United States." These were Truman's words to win votes for the Democratic Party on November 5th. Its effect on the internal affairs is greater than on the external affairs. Later, the representatives of the Islamic countries of Egypt, Iran, and Lebanon repeatedly mentioned the issue of sending "homeless" people back to their country. The Egyptian representative spoke very clearly. He said: "The repatriation of the homeless should be based on the principle of not causing disputes, especially not harming the interests of the original residents." Neither mentioned the word "Jew," but they had already "tacitly understood" in their hearts.</p>
<p>Two Talents in Egypt Do Not Mention Jewish Matters</p>
<p>The chief representative of Egypt at the General Assembly is Sir Haig, the Speaker of the Egyptian Senate, bald, wearing wide-rimmed tortoiseshell glasses. He speaks fluent French. He and Egyptian Ambassador to the United States, Sir Haisen, are the two major talents in Egypt. Sir Haisen speaks fluent English and is the Egyptian representative to the Security Council. According to internal staff of the Egyptian delegation, they do not want the General Assembly to discuss the Jewish issue. If someone raises it, Egypt will fight desperately to oppose the division of Palestine, especially to oppose Truman's unilateral pro-Jewish policy.</p>
<p>For the past thirty years, no US president has failed to show favoritism to the Jews. The Jews control American commerce, especially the American propaganda apparatus. Even Hitler was finally strangled by the Jews, let alone the head of government of a democratic country?</p>

<h3>Dongtai, An Ancient City on the Fan Gong Embankment, Returns to the Embrace of the Government</h3>
<p>— Dongtai Dispatch, October 13th, Our Reporter in Taixian, Ling Songshou</p>
<p>Dongtai has been recovered. This ancient city on the Fan Gong Embankment has returned to the embrace of the government, bringing people infinite excitement, but also infinite emotion!</p>
<p>As a reporter in northern Jiangsu, every day I write drafts and articles; from the victory until now, for more than a year, it has almost always been terrible words such as "war," "casualties," etc.; or pitiful cries such as "returning home," "relief," etc.!</p>
<p>On the 25th, the National Army began to prepare for the deployment of operations against Dongtai. The 56th Regiment searched and advanced, encountering the strong resistance of the Communist Army's Special Service Regiment of the Central Jiangsu Military Region and the 5th Regiment of the Second Sub-district in the Chongjia She Lijia She area. The battle fluctuated intermittently. The 57th Regiment advanced from Hujia Dun, the last stronghold on the periphery of Dongtai! Near the Five Gods Temple, due to the solid fortifications of the Communist Army, there was fierce fighting all day long.</p>
<p>On the 26th, the battle continued. After dusk, the 189th Regiment captured Sanzao, approaching the east gate of Dongtai. The 56th Regiment also cleared all the Communist Army strongholds in the southeast of Dongtai, less than two Chinese miles from the city. The Five Gods Temple was still in a stalemate.</p>
<p>On the 27th, the great scene of recovering Dongtai took a sharp turn for the worse within a few hours in the morning. The 57th Regiment faced the Communist Army in the Five Gods Temple head-on, and another part of it counterattacked and captured the rear route of Xixi - Five Gods Temple. The Communist Army in the Five Gods Temple was intercepted in the rear and collapsed. The 57th Regiment then continued to assault the suburbs of Dongtai City, breaking into the urban area along the Dinggong Bridge Haidao Bridge southwest of the city, and joining forces with the 56th Regiment that broke in from the Minsheng Factory south of the city at 8:00 AM. A moment later, the 189th Regiment also entered the city from the west gate and launched a mopping-up operation against the remaining Communist Army in the battlefield on the outskirts of the city.</p>
<p>By this point, the military operation of the entire half month from the 13th to the 27th had been completed successfully and quickly.</p>
<p>This battle had a bit of a "resentful" nature on the National Army's side. In mid-July, the 19th Brigade was ambushed by the Communist Army in Taixing and Xuanjiabao. After several days and nights of hard fighting, the National Army never gave up its strongholds and counterattacked in a very short time. As a result, the number of Communist Army corpses abandoned was more than five times the number of National Army casualties. In terms of the battle itself, the National Army can be said to have fully demonstrated the spirit of a soldier and achieved victory. However, in order to cover up their defeat, the Communist Army shamelessly published in the Xinhua Daily: more than 20,000 casualties of the 19th Brigade have all been wiped out. In fact, the National Army's losses were only more than 3,000 people.</p>
<p>"The National Army is not good at speaking! Hypocritical propaganda will naturally be pierced by the facts. We must have such an opportunity to tell the Communist Party: Is the 19th Brigade really defeated?" The reporter clearly remembers that this was a paragraph that Commander Li and Commander Yang of the 19th Brigade said to the reporter, waving their fists nervously.</p>
<h3>Small Waves in a Great Era Give the Communist Army a Huge Lesson</h3>
<p>This opportunity finally came. Commander Li handed over almost all of the garrison duties in Dongtai to the two regiments of the 19th Brigade - the 56th Regiment that had previously defended Taixing and the 57th Regiment that had defended Xuanjiabao.</p>
<p>He continued to tell the reporter about their troop's operational style:</p>
<p>Our operational style is purely competitive. After the 56th Regiment of our brigade, which went north by land on October 14, recovered Shijiaji, the brothers of the 57th Regiment, who were advancing by water, rubbed their fists and palms to show something. Therefore, after the operation started on the 21st, they captured Shinian in one fell swoop on the 22nd. The capture of Shinian was done by the first and second battalions. After the third battalion recovered Shinian, they rushed to pursue northeast, reaching Wujiapu in one breath. Not only are the regiments and battalions like this, but even the companies and platoons have this competitive spirit. Every soldier of the 19th Brigade thinks like this in their heart: how can we maintain the honor of our Anti-Japanese War and not tarnish the three "military medals" that we received the most among the national troops.</p>
<p>Finally, he said to the reporter: "The recovery of Dongtai is more of a political success than a military victory. There are two points that can prove this: First, wherever the National Army goes, the local people often provide a lot of assistance in transportation, intelligence, or other aspects. In particular, once, there was an earthen dam across the river, and our motorboats could not pass. Dozens of people from the countryside, regardless of age, automatically gathered, regardless of the cold weather and wet clothes, jumped into the river to help us dig the dam, so that the motorboats could pass quickly. The second is the unrest within the Communist Army. This time, the number of Communist Army soldiers who surrendered with weapons was more than the number of Communist Army soldiers we captured. They cried when they saw the National Army. Their anti-war sentiment is very high, and the information they provided about the Communist Party was also very accurate." Commander Yang, with his head shaved and wearing a pair of glasses, looked like a scholar (in fact, he is indeed a military scholar who can write poetry and prose). The more he spoke, the happier he became.</p>
<p>The recovery of Dongtai, in the turbulent waves of a great era, is a small ripple, and may not leave too deep a mark on the course of the wheel of history; but at present, it will give the Communist Army a great lesson—</p>
<p>First, the National Army cannot be defeated. Hypocritical propaganda only arouses the sneer of discerning people.</p>
<p>Second, the power of the people is infinite. Whoever causes them to lose their families and be displaced is their enemy. For the sake of survival, for the sake of living and working in peace and contentment, they will automatically exert their power, and fight to the end at any cost.</p>
<p>Third, the "cadres" of the Communist Army are now gradually becoming aware that everyone has a conscience. Deceptive tricks can only deceive for a while. When their conscience is discovered, they will want to ask: "Why should we kill each other and cause war; why should we slaughter the people and lose all conscience?" At that time, I am afraid it will also be when the Communist Army collapses.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Mountains and Water - One of the "Legends of the West" side stories -</h3>
<p>— Yang Cunren</p>
<p>The saying goes, "Guilin's mountains and waters are the best in the world," but in reality, Guilin's mountains, such as Duxiu Peak, are only beautiful, and the saying "Yangshuo's mountains and waters are the best in Guilin" is only because they are strangely beautiful. In the winter of the 19th year, I entered Sichuan by waterway, and when the boat passed through the Wu Gorge, I looked up at the Goddess Peak and other peaks floating in the clouds. The mountain scenery was like a painting, and it was also named for its beauty. Last autumn, I entered the edge of the Sichuan River and traveled along the upper reaches of the Minjiang River. After passing Longxi, I saw high peaks standing, shaped like a V. After traveling for two days, the mountain was shaped like a W, with the peaks turning and the road turning, the shape changing in myriad ways. After Diexi sank, the trails near Guanyin Cliff were steep and precipitous, the air was thin, and sand and rocks flew from time to time, earning it a reputation for danger. This spring, I left Songpan and passed the Great Snow Mountain. The wind was as cold as thorns, and the snow fell like sleet, as if entering the Arctic region. The mountains on the right were gentle, with snow that did not melt for years. The mountains on the left were rocky, with towering rock peaks. Although they could not accumulate snow, their color was like silver. In the snow, the sunlight shone on the rocks, sometimes presenting five colors. The peaks were already strange, but the colors were even stranger. The secrets of the universe were completely revealed to the Chinese.</p>
<p>Seawater is salty, and river water is yellow. Seeing more of them is not strange. The water in Diexi Lake is as blue as oil, flowing from the bottom of the sea. The surface of the water is still and has no ripples, which is strange; overlooking the three rivers from the mountains of Lianghekou, one stream is yellow, one stream is green, and one stream is black as ink, which is stranger; when it rained in Qingzhen Jiangkou, the Minjiang River flowed rapidly, and its turbidity was like the evil water under the Naihe Bridge. The momentum and color were enough to steal one's soul, which is the third strange thing.</p>
<h3>Grassland —— "Legends of the West" side story - Second -</h3>
<p>— Yang Cunren</p>
<p>According to legend, a certain party's "28,000-mile Long March" ran through the southwestern provinces and arrived in Shaanxi after passing through the grasslands of Sichuan. The grasslands of Sichuan were described as dangerous as hell, which was very touching. After I arrived in Songpan, I yearned for and missed the grasslands, and I was determined to take a trip. According to the investigation, the grasslands are not swamps and ponds, but the large plateau on the edge of Sichuan. Although the rivers are crisscrossed, the hills are densely distributed everywhere. The Tibetan people use the grasslands as grazing areas, and cattle, horses, and sheep are their property. Tents are their houses, and there are houses only where there are Lama temples, and the houses are also temples of monks. Leaving the Songpan Huangsheng Pass and entering the grasslands, passing Baozuo and Shang'e Luo, and entering Qinghai, there are a total of thirty horse stations, and it takes a month for a horse to travel out of Sichuan.</p>
<p>The Yellow River originates in Jiehai and flows into Sichuan before reaching Qinghai. The large area of Sichuan is already alarming, and the Yellow River flowing into Sichuan is not recorded in geography textbooks, which is even stranger. When the Yellow River freezes, river ice is put into cattle hair bags, and if two bags are not changed in a day, the bags will burst. This river ice is transported to Songpan and called Qing salt. The water of the Yellow River is salty and can be turned into edible salt, which is even stranger. This spring, I rode out of Huangsheng Pass and continued to travel along the upper reaches of the Minjiang River. When I lectured at the Sanliba National Songpan Vocational School, I asked how far the grasslands were. They said that the places they had passed were generally called grasslands. The flowing water, hills, woods, and grass dams were all the same as Sanliba, so there was no need to go. This made me disappointed.</p>
<h3>Concerning the Translation of Musical Terminology</h3>
<p>— Li Chi</p>
<p>It's been perhaps four or five years since I last put pen to paper to write about music! All my music books, scores, and records were lost in the war. After these several exiles and escapes, I no longer have the same state of mind as before. Three years ago in Guilin, I saw a "newly published" "Music Dictionary," but the material was a revised and altered version of the "Liangyou" edition from fifteen to twenty years ago. I casually flipped through it and couldn't help but be amazed at the editor's "miraculous power" to "resurrect" all the musicians who had died in the past quarter-century and make them alive and well. But at the time, I didn't have the energy to write about it. Isn't "having" always better than "not having"? That was wartime.</p>
<p>Recently, in "Chunqiu," I saw articles by Zhu Lixing, Zhang Ning, Joseph Zhu Wusheng, and others discussing the translation of musician names. I don't know why, but I wanted to try my hand at writing. But let me state upfront: first, I am a layman when it comes to music. I am incapable of "showing off my skills," let alone in front of an expert. I hope to simply throw out a broken tile and attract back a diamond. Second, I have no reference materials at hand while writing, so this entire piece is written under the premise of "if my memory doesn't deceive me." I only hope to raise questions; the solutions and conclusions, I hope, will come from experts and pioneers.</p>
<p>1. What to Translate?</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu proposed that the transliteration of Western musician names should be standardized. Everyone agrees with this sentiment. However, it seems that what should be reviewed and standardized is not limited to "the issue of transliteration in musical arts" (as Mr. Zhu originally titled it). The Chinese translation of composer names is only one aspect of unfairness.</p>
<p>Is it "小提琴" (xiǎo tí qín - violin), "四絋琴" (sì xián qín - four-stringed instrument), or "懷娥鈐" (huái é qián - a completely phonetic transcription)? Shouldn't this be standardized just like the Chinese translation of Beethoven's name?</p>
<p>Before the Pacific War in Hong Kong, I "overestimated my abilities" and wrote down a plan, hoping to create a Chinese translation table for musical terms and names within a few years, to be used for my own purposes. But this work "stopped shortly after starting" because it exceeded my capabilities.</p>
<p>(1) The most common titles, author names, and terms for musical forms on concert programs and famous records.</p>
<p>(2) Instrument names in orchestras and military bands: and the most common musical terms in solo performances and ensemble performances.</p>
<p>(3) The names of famous performers, conductors, orchestras, etc.</p>
<p>The above seems to be the most urgently needed. In addition to expanding on the above, I would at least like to include:</p>
<p>(4) Special terms and "proper nouns" in music theory and music history.</p>
<p>(5) Unique symbols and terms for the performance of various instruments on orchestral "scores."</p>
<p>(6) Terms for "Jazz" and "Swing." (I don't discriminate against them as much as the "academic school." I will omit the reason for now.)</p>
<p>(7) Musical terms and "proper nouns" in various folk music traditions.</p>
<p>(8) Others... (such as famous music educators, researchers, critics, authors, instrument makers, etc.) The question of how to translate composer names into Chinese seems to occupy only a relatively small proportion.</p>
<p>2. Difficult to Translate?</p>
<p>Are the nouns and names listed above difficult to translate? Yes! Extremely difficult! First, the difficulty lies in the collection, selection, and review of the original text. What should be the basis for pronunciation and the Shanghai dialect?</p>
<p>Second, how to decide whether to transliterate or translate by meaning.</p>
<p>Third, should existing Chinese translations be respected, or should they be re-translated?</p>
<p>Fourth, should absolute accuracy be prioritized, or should convenience be accommodated? What should be the dividing line? ...And others.</p>
<p>Difficult! Just look at those experts who spend their entire lives researching the catalog of a composer's works, and look at the Japanese "Broadcasting Corporation" which took five years and more than thirty experts to compile a provisional standard music vocabulary of less than a hundred pages. These can all serve as supporting evidence. I think this kind of work is best left to institutions like the "National Institute for Compilation and Translation." One person can only do a very small part at most.</p>
<p>Foreign languages are naturally an obstacle. Roughly counting, I'm afraid that just to achieve the first item in the above section would require encountering more than ten languages, even Hebrew, Latin, and Indian languages would be needed. When it comes to song titles, there are many allusions, legends, myths, personal anecdotes, etc... That's why I say it's extremely difficult! But difficult as it is, it must be done.</p>
<p>3. Square Characters?</p>
<p>Aside from translation by meaning, the square Chinese characters used as a tool for transliteration are a big problem. While they can sometimes help the translator cut corners, in more cases, they are like an old scale for weighing coal being used by a chemist as an analytical balance! The standard pronunciation of square characters is Beijing Mandarin, but the consonants, vowels, and their combinations in Beijing Mandarin are among the simplest of all existing Chinese dialects. Compared to the rhyme books of the Tang and Song dynasties, the "Poetry Rhymes" of the late Qing Dynasty had greatly reduced rhyme categories, and the "National Phonetic New Poetry Rhymes," based on Beijing Mandarin, further reduced the rhyme categories by removing the "entering tone." (This seems to be a general trend in the historical development of phonetics.) How can this one-wheeled "rickshaw" be equipped to become a universal transportation tool for land and sea?</p>
<p>We only need to count the number of empty squares on that "National Phonetic Commonly Used Characters List" which uses "sounds" as the latitude and "rhymes" as the longitude, and we will know how many squares are empty, and how pitifully few the pronunciations of the remaining characters are.</p>
<p>Not having enough is one problem, but another difficulty lies in the fact that square characters are not "phonetic alphabets," and each character also has a meaning. Even if the transliteration is correct, a transliteration like "悲多憤" (bēi duō fèn - a phonetic transliteration of Beethoven), can't be used in a thousand years!</p>
<p>4. Romanization?</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that square characters are not as good as phonetic symbols, and the National Romanization system is more refreshing and flexible than phonetic symbols. It may be difficult to apply it universally at present, but I still hope that in dictionaries or vocabularies, words that are transliterated should be accompanied by the National Romanization system as phonetic symbols. It would be best to also note the "International Phonetic Alphabet," but this would go beyond the scope of "transliteration."</p>
<p>People who believe in "English omnipotence" may think that just using twenty-six letters is enough, but in fact, the difference between English and square characters is only "fifty steps versus a hundred steps"! Even using that "artificial" "International Phonetic Alphabet" specifically for phonetic transcription, recording other small ethnic languages and local languages, you have to add all sorts of auxiliary symbols to explain things, except for a few large ethnic languages. Stop saying "English is omnipotent"! In the end, this question boils down to the precision of transliteration.</p>
<p>5. Original Pronunciation?</p>
<p>Even if the "tools" of transliteration (such as square characters or phonetic symbols) are solved, studying the pronunciation of the original text is not necessarily an easy task. In larger ethnic languages, you can consult dictionaries of each language and then "convert" them like "official exchange rates" based on their original standards, but in the music of smaller ethnic groups, if the original text contains "obsolete words" and "rare words"..., you often encounter difficulties. For example, if a song title or main lyrics quote an ancient Greek or Fuzhou deity's name, how should it be handled? Should it be based on the original text used by the composer, or should one further trace the "original" pronunciation of the original text?</p>
<p>Many people think that the accents that people are familiar with can be recorded. I don't know that this is a huge danger. It is well known that not every American can pronounce Bach or Chopin correctly. Even with the transliteration of Mozart that Mr. Zhu mentioned, there would likely be many differences in how educated Austrians pronounce it in conversation. Because the standard pronunciation of "single words" in the dictionary is different from that in a "sentence," and "language changes with emotion" is an unbreakable rule, which I will explain later.</p>
<p>In short, I believe that establishing a standard for the Chinese translation of music terminology and proper nouns related to music is a difficult but urgently needed task. But "urgency" must also be "accurate," and "difficulty" must be "done." However, when it comes to "accuracy," there are limits, and the degree is lower when using square characters as a tool for transliteration. As mentioned in the example above, no chemist can rely on an old scale to measure a tiny amount of one-thousandth of a gram.</p>
<h3>Still Life</h3>

<h3>Fragments on Poetry</h3>
<p>— by Lin Feng</p>
<p>It's not just what is expressed in the form of poetry that is poetry. Novels, essays, dramas—anything that contains poetic elements can be called poetry. Shakespeare's "Hamlet" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream," Turgenev's "A House of Gentlefolk" and "Smoke," and Gogol's "Dead Souls" are all beautiful poems edited and published by humanity.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 108</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Tsurumi, under the soft light of the dance hall, looked at the paper, holding down the uneven corner with one hand. On the paper, about the size of an ordinary envelope, were clearly printed three photos: one of Tsurumi getting off the plane, dressed in travel attire; one of Tsurumi in his gentlemanly attire that evening; and another a close-up, showing only a portion of his face, but with every detail of his features clear and his spirit radiant. Below the photos were arranged four large characters: "Person of Interest"! Several other lines of smaller text noted Tsurumi's date of birth, background, qualifications, current position, etc.</p>
<p>"Big Brother, now you know I wasn't making up rumors! Like this piece of paper, probably every related organization, every related person, has one in their hands. Big Brother, you've become an important person; but also a target of public criticism!" Ping said, smiling mischievously. At the same time, like performing a magic trick, without leaving a trace, she flicked her fingers and folded the paper back as it was. On the table, only the food menu remained. After she waved her hand over it repeatedly, the paper had disappeared. Pingzi even playfully flicked her rosy jade-like hand at Tsurumi, turning it over and letting it go, completely imitating the movements of a magician manipulating playing cards.</p>
<p>"I am grateful for Miss's consideration, needless to say..." Tsurumi also chimed in, quickly picking up the drink menu card, just in time to place it squarely on her outstretched palm as Pingzi had not yet withdrawn her hand. Unexpectedly, Pingzi flipped her palm, letting the card slide off and fall on the table, and leaned back into the chair, folding her jade arm. Her perfectly shaped small lips pouted up:</p>
<p>"My name is Pingzi, my surname is Nakamura, I'm twenty-four years old, born in Fukushima. Haven't you investigated that clearly yet? Even if you don't call me Pingmei—that's my most intimate Chinese poetic name—you can call me Pingzi, or Willow Poetry..." Her expression at this time really had a bit of poetic meaning, and could be painted, the title of the painting being "Like Resentment, Like Longing."</p>
<p>"Alright, Pingzi, I admit defeat!" Tsurumi smiled with a pained expression.</p>
<p>Pingzi sighed slightly, "Big Brother, you won't surrender. I'm the one surrendering... but I have one more heartfelt thing to say. If you don't mind, I'll say it; if you do mind, I'll still say it. I want to advise you: this time, Big Brother, you came back to Tokyo and joined such a terrifying secret organization. No matter what your motives are, it's best to leave Tokyo as soon as possible, whether you go back to work in your department or go to the Chinese mainland, because those are relatively one-sided matters, unlike here, which is multifaceted, and it's difficult to please any one side. This is my little contribution from the bottom of my heart." Pingzi simply explained the danger of Tokyo and the reason why she was ordered to monitor him.</p>
<p>After hearing these words, Tsurumi lit his cigar and paused for a moment, without answering Pingzi's words. Instead, he suddenly reached out and beckoned a waiter standing far away, whispering two words in his ear. The waiter responded and left. Only then did Tsurumi look at Pingzi and say, "When the music plays 'The Blue Danube,' I want to ask you to dance once. Won't I be refused?"</p>
<p>"I don't think any woman can refuse to dance with you, and of course I can't be an exception either." Pingzi became a little animated, immediately taking a sip of "Victory Rice."</p>

<h3>Poor Child</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>A person who has suffered a certain kind of pain and, once they have the means, immediately tries their best to relieve others of this pain is truly rare in today's society and worthy of praise.</p>
<p>I know of such a person in Shanghai. In his childhood, he was poor and relied on his mother to wash clothes for others to make a living. He was determined to make progress and studied hard in a poor children's home. Later, he went to a factory to work and study part-time. It was five miles from his home to the factory. He went early and returned late every day. He couldn't bear to wear the cloth shoes his mother made for him, so he took them off as he left the house and ran barefoot for ten miles back and forth. At that time, he made a wish that when he had the ability in the future, he would definitely establish more elementary schools for poor children to help those who had the same painful experience of being out of school as he did. After graduating, he left his hometown and came to Shanghai to make a living. He was hardworking and patient, starting as a police officer and later engaging in business. In a few years, he became very wealthy and had the financial resources to realize his dream. So he immediately founded an elementary school for poor children, charging students no fees and supporting it independently. Initially, he and his wife also served as teachers. Over the years, they have cultivated many young children. Currently, there are more than two hundred children in the school. The sound of music never ceases, and it has gained great reputation.</p>
<p>The reason why I am telling this story here is, of course, because I am touched and feel that if today's society is to progress, there should be more and more good people like this.</p>
<p>A person who has experienced the pain of hunger can do their best to prevent others from being hungry. A person who has experienced the pain of cold can do their best to prevent others from being cold. How can this society not progress? Of course, we would prefer that people who have not experienced suffering could also do this. However, "throwing away the teaching stick and going to beg," aren't there too many people like this? Shouldn't these people be ashamed if they read the story above?</p>
<p>Secret History of World War II</p>
<h3>Atomic Bomb Nearly Used by the Nazis 2</h3>
<p>— Translated by Lan Ning from the November issue of "Reader's Digest"</p>
<p>At that time, the Norsk Hydro plant was building a new sluice gate to increase the production of heavy water. Einar obtained a job there through the introduction of his brother. With infinite care, he organized a reliable group of his most trusted friends, from which he obtained all kinds of information about the factory. This information was telegraphed to the intelligence hub in London.</p>
<p>According to Einar's report, the production of heavy water was increasing rapidly; the products were shipped to Germany every month. The British War Cabinet ordered the Combined Operations Headquarters to organize a commando team to immediately attack Norsk Hydro.</p>
<p>The Combined Operations Headquarters used all the experience of previous battles to undertake this most difficult task. The unpredictable roaring of violent air currents over the Klegge Mountains made Norway the most difficult area in Europe for parachutes or gliders to invade. But with the help of Dr. Tronstad (who directed the construction of the correct model of the target and explained its internal situation), and Einar's accurate reports, the Grouse team (which was their secret code name this time) was finally completed on paper.</p>
<p>Four carefully selected Norwegians, all residents of the area who were skilled at skiing, would parachute in advance to Einar to prepare to meet the invading British airborne troops. Twice, bombers took the commando team to the skies over Norway, ready to parachute, but were forced to retreat due to thick clouds. Finally, on a certain evening in October 1942, they finally moved; a few hours later, all five people jumped into the dark night one after another. The next morning, they found themselves in the mountains, more than a hundred miles away from the activity site. They spent two days finding the equipment scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>Grouse</p>
<p>For the next fifteen days, the "Grouse" team made a typical snow march. At an altitude of four thousand feet, with temperatures consistently below zero, one person could carry at most sixty pounds of equipment. This meant that to carry his one hundred and twenty pounds of equipment, each person had to walk the same road three times. Each person's daily ration was only a small piece of cheese, a small handful of flour, and four biscuits.</p>
<p>On November 9th, the commander anxiously waiting at the Combined Operations Headquarters heard the "Grouse" team's secret code. They had arrived at a location near Norsk Heide Rotho and had contacted Einar, ready to use radio and lights to guide the destruction team going by glider.</p>
<p>On November 19th, two Halifax bombers departed from England, each towing a glider full of airborne troops. A few hours later, a special operations officer in Norway telegraphed that the bomber and glider had been lost and crashed, and all the personnel in the aircraft were either dead or captured.</p>
<p>Even worse news followed. A German military intelligence officer, searching the wreckage of the plane, found a map with the town of Vermok, where the heavy water plant was located, marked with a red line. The highest administrative officer in Norway, Dupven, and the commander-in-chief, Falkenhorst, hurriedly went to Vermok to inspect the defenses. Nazi stormtroopers searched the surrounding area and arrested everyone suspected of being pro-British. But they did not catch any members of the "Grouse" team.</p>
<p>Hardship</p>
<p>In London, the hardworking Combined Operations Headquarters could only start all over again. The plan to attack using gliders was abandoned. Six Norwegian members of the Special Forces would parachute in. Treponse used maps and models to train them. Time was running out. The "Grouse" team's limited food and batteries for the wireless were running out, struggling to survive in a snow-covered cabin on a mountain top four thousand feet high. Except for the team leader, they were all suffering from illness. Miles away, Einar was hiding from the Nazi agents' search, but every few days, he still skied in the twilight, sneaking to the vicinity of Vermok to meet with those loyal informants.</p>
<p>Soon, Einar radioed London an almost unbelievable message: for some reason, the Germans believed that the commandos' target was not the Norsk Heide Rotho plant, but the new sluice gate being built nearby. A hundred new guards had been sent to the sluice gate, while only twelve were left at the factory.</p>
<p>By the end of December, the "Gunnerside" team (this was another secret code name) was ready to depart. One night, these six Norwegians parachuted onto the frozen Skrykken Lake, thirty miles north of where the "Grouse" team was hiding. The most violent snowstorm in decades swept across the mountains, preventing them from setting off. These Norwegians struggled through five days, freezing and starving, in a deserted house. When the snowstorm had passed, they continued their journey. As they approached the meeting place, they suddenly saw two skiers in the distance. If they encountered a German patrol at this time, things would be bad. One of the "Gunnerside" team members put on a disguise, put on a civilian hat, and went to meet the stranger. If it was a German, he would pretend to be a deer hunter. The rest lay down in the snow, holding their guns tightly in their hands. But then, breaking through the tight wind, came three ecstatic cheers. The "Gunnerside" and "Grouse" had finally met.</p>
<p>That's How It Was</p>
<p>In a streetcar in Chicago, I saw a ticket seller being very polite to the passengers. This was a rare thing. After the passengers got off, I chatted with him.</p>
<p>"Ah," he explained, "Five years ago, I saw in the newspaper that a person had given a sum of money in his will to someone he didn't really know, because of his modesty. "That's possible," I thought, "This might happen to me." So, I started treating the passengers like friends. Later, I felt that treating people this way was good for both them and me. Now, I no longer care whether someone will give me a million dollars. I still continue to do this!"</p>
<p>How Much is it Worth?</p>
<p>When my wife lost her purse, we had to jump off the train again. At this time, a porter ran over breathlessly and returned the purse. He refused our thank-you money. "If you don't mind my being presumptuous, ma'am, I'd like to know how much money is in your purse in total."</p>
<p>My wife told him. He took out a small notebook and added the number to a pile of numbers below. "I'm recording the numbers to calculate how much valuable honesty is worth to me in the future," he explained.</p>

<p>A Cross-Section of Shanghai</p>
<h3>The Organization of Beggars 2</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>The Formation of the Beggar Gang</p>
<p>The beggar gangs are individual organizations composed of countless small groups. Each small group must have a "reliable" "Uncle Group" as its leader, leading from seven or eight to more than twenty people. The most important condition is to pre-occupy a base-like location. Then, they can cultivate power in the nearby territory. Therefore, at this time, the problem of food and lodging has been solved, and they can naturally carry out "mooching" activities.</p>
<p>The child beggars taken in by the "Uncles" are called "Little Ghosts." These people are mostly poor children wandering the streets, most of whom are homeless. Once taken in and provided with food and accommodation, they must obey orders completely, and all the money they mooch must be handed over in full. Only when they are old enough to be self-sufficient can they leave. At that time, they can also lead their own "Little Ghosts" and join the ranks of the "Uncle Group." If they are naturally clumsy and lack the ability to stand alone even when they are older, and fail to obtain the position of "Uncle," their status is between the "Uncle" and the "Little Ghost," and they are called "Party Members." In addition, there is a kind of middle-aged down-and-out rogue who has not gone through the "Little Ghost" stage before falling into beggary. Although they are reluctantly taken in by the "Uncles," they are ultimately without support in the gang, and the gang members call them "Foreign Gun Members." The "Uncles" refer to each other as "Brothers in Mooching." Because they are in the same boat, they usually pay attention to "building relationships." If a conflict occurs and they cannot coordinate with each other, they must invite "white-collar workers" with face from various sections to come out to evaluate and resolve the situation. If it still cannot be resolved, they have no choice but to resort to force.</p>
<p>Their Headquarters</p>
<p>The primary question for the establishment of each beggar gang subgroup is whether it possesses a territory. Beggar brothers without a territory are like stray souls in Shanghai, with no place to settle down, and it is impossible to talk about forming a small group. In the former Qing Dynasty, beggars from outside gangs had beggar factories to live in. However, in their eyes, the Old Brothers were still some non-mainstream beggars, and they had no right to set foot in beggar factories. Therefore, the Old Brothers had to rely on their own strength to develop outwards.</p>
<p>Shanghai is densely populated, and the alleys are closely connected. In each alley, there are always empty spaces at the front and back, which is the New World for the Old Brothers. They called on friends and relatives and occupied these places as their residence. These occupied places are collectively called "Buckets" by the people in the know. However, because it is an open-air territory, they have to temporarily move to avoid the severe winter and rain. Therefore, the most ideal "Bucket" is the place under the overpass buildings inside and outside the alleys. Because it can be supported as a bed to store quilts and sundries. Even if rain and snow fall suddenly, it is not enough to worry about. Therefore, the place under the overpass building is indeed the Golden City Jade Palace in the "Bucket," and it is a place that the brothers in the gang must compete for.</p>
<h3>Too Late</h3>
<p>— Yu Feng</p>
<p>A gentleman went to a restaurant to eat. When he saw the dishes served, he sighed regretfully.</p>
<p>"Ah! If I had known there were such dishes, I should have come a few days earlier."</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir, for thinking highly of us, it's really..." The waiter hurried to be polite.</p>
<p>"Don't get me wrong, what I mean is that if I had eaten such a good dish a few days earlier, it would have been fresh."</p>
<p>"……!"</p>

<p>Beauty and Banknotes</p>
<p>According to the newspaper, Yang Xiuqiong, the mermaid swimmer who was once famous in China, has recently married a celebrity from Sichuan Province, ×××. It is said that the condition is a marriage guarantee of 200 million yuan, plus 500 million yuan for new home equipment. Hero and beauty, both are rare, which is really enviable. However, the fact that this includes a "condition" of 700 million yuan is a bit of a drawback to the good story. It is said that this gentleman won 7 billion in a night of gambling in Shanghai, so it is really easy to use one-tenth of the gambling money to win the heart of a beauty. Writing here, I also thought of such a thing that recently happened in Fuzhou: Mayor Yan of Fuzhou suggested that the budget revenue and expenditure for next year are insufficient by 600 million yuan, so he proposed collecting a fee for the management of prostitutes to make up for it. This has been approved by the Municipal Council, but when women's groups learned of it, they were greatly angered and held a symposium to strongly oppose it. The reason is: "Women cannot be treated as commodities." The mere amount of 600 million yuan has caused an uproar, and big topics such as "humanitarianism" and "women's movement" have been brought out. In fact, it is really rare to see and strange to hear. Don't you see that even marriage is conditional here, and it's 700 million yuan? We are singing praises and admiring it, it's too late to do that! How can we talk about "opposition"? Long live the beauty! Long live the banknotes!</p>
<p>Wool Blanket Wool Blanket</p>
<p>According to rumors, the allocation of American military blankets to public school personnel, which has already been registered, may become a pie in the sky. This is because the Bureau of Materials Supply is already declaring "no goods." It would be fine if there were no goods, but according to a news agency: "A few days ago, an American Jewish businessman, using the name of Jialing Foreign Company, purchased 5,000 wool blankets from the bureau at one time. A few hours after this businessman received the delivery note, a large number of blankets appeared in the black market trading places for American goods and materials in Central Lane of Sichuan Road and other places." This is clearly and truly "there are goods," but they are monopolized for "delivery" by some high-ranking Chinese who are blinded by profit. When we see the "black goods" on the roadside, we really miss those "precious goods" who control the power of allocation. The "precious goods" may only want to make a fortune by giving "Ning to foreign businessmen, not to their families," but you should think again: The "Bureau of Materials Supply" is an organ of the Chinese government. Can the ancient Chinese training of "the distinction between righteousness and profit" be disregarded so blatantly? The allocated blankets were delivered to us in good faith by allied countries. Have we forgotten the "distinction between humans and beasts" that people pointed out in the American Evening News? Banknotes will eventually run out, but our anger will not end there!</p>
<p>Black Market for Feces</p>
<p>In the season when rice is as expensive as pearls, farmers regard feces and garbage, which are the main components of fertilizer, as treasures. In the city, we often dislike the noise of the dung carts at dawn. In fact, from the hard work of these people collecting and transporting, the cleanliness of the city is maintained, and our lives are also indirectly cultivated and nourished. Before China's chemical fertilizer industry is fully developed, feces still occupy an important part of farmers' production costs, so the black market price of feces has soared in the past two days as the wheat season is about to begin. Shanghai businessmen are so smart that they are omnipresent. In addition to expressing our admiration, we really need to submit a memorandum to the authorities: Shanghai City can now produce more than 2,000 tons of garbage and 3,000 tons of feces per day. These are the most suitable raw materials for compost. Why can't we make an overall plan to manufacture and directly distribute them to farmers? "It is hateful to discard goods on the ground, and it is not necessary to store them for oneself." In the midst of suppressing grain prices, we deeply hope that the bureau will pay attention to the utilization of these wastes that people discard like worn-out shoes, effective utilization, and scientific utilization!</p>
<p>Beyond Praise</p>
<p>Last month, a funny story happened in Hangzhou: Rickshaw puller and city council member Zhao Tingxiu was beaten and humiliated by the police. As a result, the authorities investigated and punished the murderer and apologized. It is said that this fact that "represents the spirit of Chinese democracy" has "shocked the world" because major American newspapers attached great importance to it and translated and published it in a prominent position. The news published by them was even more detailed and accurate than the news published by local newspapers in Hangzhou. The good news spread far and wide, which was originally a grand event, and many sensitive people took it as an honor to deal with things. However, the reason why people especially publicize our democratic spirit is precisely because there are too many places where we are obscured by the undemocratic spirit; rare news is enough to arouse interest, so there is such a lively performance. If this matter had happened in the beginning, and Zhao Tingxiu was only a rickshaw puller and not a city council member, then a beating and a few days of detention would have been too commonplace. With the power of the police, he would never have tolerated a person engaged in a lowly occupation such as rickshaw pulling arguing with him in front of him. City council members are officials, and rickshaw pullers are civilians. After all, there is still a big difference in the treatment received by officials and civilians. Before the "event representing the spirit of Chinese democracy" praised by the American newspapers, we should feel infinite panic and shame.</p>
