<p>〔本報牯嶺四日電〕馬歇爾特使四日晚八時半晋謁蔣主席，聞談話達兩小時許，其內容未發表，但據可靠方面訊，雙方曾就「安平事件」之報吿，略有商談。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺四日電〕馬歇爾元帥四日晚八時半赴行轅晋謁蔣主席，宋院長子文亦在座，聞所談內容曾涉及安平事件，直至十時蔣主席與馬·宋兩氏方步出行轅，由蔣夫人·馬帥夫人相陪，沿小溪散步十分鐘而別。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺四日電〕馬歇爾特使四日晨九時訪司徒大使，長談達一小時之久，聞馬帥表示在美軍被襲擊事件未解決以前，和平談判萬難進行。關於在華美軍撤退一事，司徒大使認爲尚不至於實行。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺四日電〕司徒大使·馬帥夫婦暨蔣夫人，四日午十一時均到敎堂做禮拜。下午五時司徒大使答訪馬歇爾特使，談半小時，聞大使五日將再謁主席，並定六日返京。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺四日電〕據司徒大使告本報記者云：渠及中國政府均己接獲「安平事件」之報吿，渠現惟靜待華盛頓之命令，以憑處理。渠甚望不致因此反常之不幸事件而影響常態，大使語此時，正倚窗觀書，態度鎭靜自若，並露慈祥之笑容。此可顯示大使對中國友誼之溫和熱情而富有耐心。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京四日電〕傳杜魯門總統已授權馬歇爾特使自行判斷，以便逐步撤退在華美軍，避免意外事件如安平事件之再度發生。此說頃由馬帥行館否認，謂絕無所聞。</p>

<p>〔中央社牯嶺四日電〕宋院長抵牯，備受各界熱烈歡迎，當宋院長進入牯嶺市街前，曾下轎與記者且行且談，據稱：違別廬山幾逾十年。</p>
<h3>柯克昨自牯抵滬　謁主席曾商訓練我海軍　與馬帥等會談內容守密</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺四日電〕美駐華艦隊總司令柯克上將四日晨九時偕夫人及男女公子離牯轉京赴滬，由皮參軍宗敢陪送下山。柯克上將在下山前，曾接見本報記者，據稱：此次來山，蒙蔣主席夫婦熱誠招待，深以爲感，並閒遊數日，很爲愉快，對於平津公路美軍被襲擊事，柯克上將曾將詳細經過吿稱：據報吿所得，此事爲共軍第五三團所爲，美軍死三人傷十人，該美軍中包括執行總部軍官，係自天津運送供應品至北平執行總部，中有一部份行總物資，運輸隊經常自津至平，每週兩次，此次經過時，確有多人預先埋伏，彼等未及抵抗，即遭襲擊，但對於柯克上將與馬帥，司徒大使所談內容，均不願表示。同時對於美政府態度及其個人意見，亦云不便表示。柯克上將繼稱：來山後，曾與主席談及協同訓練中國海軍問題，美方贈給我國之艦艇，共有十六艘。</p>
<p>〔合衆社牯嶺四日電〕柯克海軍上將今日對記者談稱：渠曾向蔣主席報吿中國海軍訓練計劃之進行情形，並討論安平事件。柯克斷然否認共產黨所稱美陸戰隊攻擊共軍之說，謂美護送隊携帶行總物品前往北平執行總部交與美軍官員，途中遭埋伏共軍之襲擊。記者詢以美國政府將採取何種步驟時，柯克答稱不知。</p>

<p>〔本埠訊〕柯克上將昨由牯返京路華懋飯店五樓，招待中外記者，有所報告。</p>
<p>十一戰區發表安平案件經過</p>
<p>〔中央社北平三日電〕十一戰區發言人，發表美軍在香河附近被共軍襲擊經過稱：七月廿九日，美海軍陸戰隊官兵四十一名，在安平鎭附近突遭共軍襲擊事件，孫長官極爲重視，當令戰區高副參謀長松元率同第五區專員黃任材，香河縣長班長會儒等前往肇事地點，實地調查，高副參謀長松元等，於二日晨六時到達馬頭鎭，詢問駐軍後，即赴安平鎭，會同該鎭士紳赴肇事地點實地詳查。美軍被襲地點，在安平鎭東南約八華里之大沙河村附近，該地爲通縣·武情·香河三縣交界處，公路兩側，均掘有深溝，溝旁且植有叢密之玉蜀黍，藉於隱蔽。據鄉民稱：此處大路，常見美軍車輛通過，從未發生事故，，最近有共軍第五三團（第十四軍分區）李敏溪部約四五百人，多穿着灰軍服及便衣，出沒附近各村落，強派食糧，截掠行人。七月廿五日曾召集鄉民開反美運動大會，七月廿七·八日兩日，在安平鎭東南附近地區，封鎖交通，封鎖消息，截刦行人，擬於該地有所準備，經鄕民等跪求，請免戰禍，未允，至廿九日上午七時，即分別埋伏於大沙河公路兩側之深溝及附近各村各樹林中，並强抓百姓牛車，橫塞公路之上，十二時廿分，有美軍卡車通過該地，突遭伏兵襲擊，詢問當時戰鬥情形，據云：吾等老百姓也不敢去看，僅知道美軍被打死三個人，受傷十幾個人，共軍也傷亡數十人，當天黃昏，就向東北方向走了，到那裏去，吾等亦不敢問，臨行並將本鎭一個老頭帶走，聽說因爲他會打槍，下午四時，高副參謀長以眞像已白，逐率調處人員返平。按安平鎭大小沙河，原於六月二日以前爲我香河縣警一中隊駐守，嗣因調整防務關係，故將該中隊調駐石槽（馬頭鎭西南二華里），該地以後即未駐有國軍。</p>
<h3>美軍之被襲擊　係出共黨預謀</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺四日電〕據某權威人士稱：「安平事件」共產黨已公開承認，據謂美軍往來於平津路之上輸送北平軍調部所屬美軍人員之給養，每星期必有兩次，其任務至爲明顯，北平軍調部爲國共美三方所有之機構，共產黨所稱美軍與國軍進攻「解放區」，實乃誣蔑之詞，足見此事之發生顯係出於預謀，吾人應注意共產黨此種「可疑」之宣傳。</p>
<h3>重傷美兵三名送往靑島治療</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平四日電〕七月廿九日在大小沙河村被襲負傷之十二美兵，其中三名因傷勢較重，於二日晨專機運往靑島，交美海軍醫院船瑞彼斯號治療。又留平負傷美兵，傷勢較輕者，已有數名出院，其尚未出院者，經過亦均良好，連日我官方及民間代表前往慰問者極衆。</p>

<h3>政府飛機執行任務時　並未經延安上空　國防部發言人斥中共借端尋釁</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕國防部發言人四日發表談話稱：國軍飛機一架，曾於六月廿六日迷失方向，被迫降落延安北郊，後因無法飛回，本月二日空軍當局乃派機前往將該機銷毀。査該機係停落於延安郊外飛機塲附近山內，所派飛機於執行此任務時，並未經過延安上空，近日延安廣播宣傳國軍飛機轟炸延安各節，純屬共方借端虛構，聳人聽聞。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕延安被炸一事，已引起共產黨代表團莫須有之慌張情緒，唯頃據國防部發言人稱：係因索回前被迫降落延安飛機一架未果，乃前往轟炸者，故其目標顯不在其「總司令部」，而爲此飛機也。共方所稱延安被炸乃係政府發動「全面內戰的信號」，足見其極盡挑釁之能事，軍方某氏謂：「我們自然只炸那一架飛機，如果我們想炸延安，又何必要到今天呢？」共產黨發言人所稱之「空前嚴重」一節，不知其有何根據。</p>
<h3>中共捕風捉影</h3>
<p>國軍已無九二師番號</p>
<p>何來正副師長被俘事</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕記者就新華社八月二日所稱「國軍第九十二師正副師長被俘」事，走訪國防部發言人，叩詢眞相，發言人稱：國軍於整編後根本即無第九十二師番號之存在，駐防徐州東南魚溝一帶之國軍第九十二旅之一部，七月廿八日被共軍襲擊，曾略向後撤，九十二旅旅長艾　，副旅長沈盛楷，即親率部增援，將共軍擊退，新華社首先揑稱艾旅長被俘，三日延安廣播又托詞誤傳，自行否認，可見共方一向宣傳均係捕風捉影，亳無事實根據。</p>
<h3>陳總長抵牯　過潯檢閱駐軍</h3>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺四日電〕參謀總長陳誠，四日下午五時由京抵牯，過潯時曾檢閱駐軍梁勃所部，並接見砲艇總隊長張日章少將，垂詢長江防務，抵牯後逕赴中路一〇六號私邸休息，總長夫人及其六位男女公子同來。中央社記者往迎於半山亭小天池之間，總長談稱：胃病已愈三週，今日經五小時之長空旅行，身體無疲乏感覺，詢及軍事政治問題，總長允明日詳談。</p>
<h3>魯共軍指導員在濟反正投誠</h3>
<p>〔中央社濟南四日電〕共軍魯西渭河支隊政治指導員李國衛因目睹共軍禍國殃民，罪行明彰，不甘爲騙使，乃於三日利用被派到濟，擔任暗殺工作之機會，逕向第二綏靖區司令部投誠，並親寫自傳一篇，宣佈永遠脫離共產黨籍。</p>
<h3>夏令營紀念週　主席決親主持</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺四日電〕廬山夏令營明晨舉行之紀念週蔣主席將親臨主持，在廬之最高政工人員亦均將全體參加。紀念週後，主席將召見夏令營大隊長以上人員，有所指示。又八月七日上午九時，主席將至夏令營召見全體官員點名訓話。</p>
<h3>美既定對華政策　決不致有所更張</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京四日電〕蔣主席現在牯嶺，正與馬歇爾及司徒雷登會商，各方皆認爲局勢「極嚴」重。中國官員指稱：美國對華政策業經國務卿貝爾納斯闡明，由杜魯門總統核准，當不致即在此時改變，在事態廓淸之前，決不致有所更張，即使加以廓淸之後，將否影響美國業已明定之對華方針，亦尚屬疑問。共黨方面現續在對美軍當局施以「退出中國」之壓力，共黨報章之言論有謂：「吾人重申吾人之要求，美國陸海空軍完全退出中國乃一永久辦法」。南京報章引美軍某發言人之談話稱：美國對此事件極引爲遺憾，但所有美軍不致立即退出中國，蓋此乃徇蔣主席之要求而留駐中國。有詢以對安平事件作何感想？答曰：聞馬歇爾已吿「中央日報」，謂「極爲惡劣」云。</p>
<h3>美對陸戰隊被襲事件　已向延安提警告　吉倫稱軍事團工作加緊</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕駐華美軍司令吉倫將軍，昨接見記者，據稱：中美兩國始終爲良好之友人，在戰時駢肩作戰，打退敵人，此爲有目共睹，無可否認之事實。而今日世界大戰結束，吾人爲全世界之安全及今後人類之和平而努力，此種任務，當更爲重大，需要吾人更多之努力與奮鬥。美國始終希望與中國合作，爲人類之安全而努力，安平事件發生後，美軍已向延安方面提出警吿，吉倫將軍不願再有何表示。記者復詢以最近美國輿論方面對中國事件有不同之批評，不久以前且有一部份人士撰文，主張停運軍火來華之事，將軍對此事拒絕批評，但表示中美是友好的，美方甚願協助中國解決困難。渠並表示，從事新聞事業者，對世界安全亦負重大之責任，今日世界人類當全為此目標而努力。吉倫將軍從軍卅餘年，參加第一·二次世界大戰，鄭重表示，維護世界和平，非但爲軍人天職，亦爲全球人類所共負之責任。記者詢及上海美軍撤退之確定日期，渠不願發表，僅稱，即在最近期間。吉倫本人在司令部結束後再任何職，亦暫緩發表，上海美軍司令部之結束，乃因渠等之任務已完成，南京之軍事顧問團及北平之軍調部，仍繼續其任務。談及軍事顧問團事，吉倫將軍稱。此機構正在加緊工作，若中國和平早日實現，訓練中國海陸空軍之工作，即能積極展開，中國方面已遣派敎官百餘人赴美深造，回國後亦參加顧問團之工作，顧問團現正計劃選擇適中地點，爲訓練軍隊之營地，該團美方之專門軍事人材，極爲衆多。最後，記者又叩詢對中國之印象，將軍笑曰：「甚好」並為記者詳述其日常生活，將軍於公餘之暇，喜作棒球之戲，每逢週末，常組棒球隊在其私邸作棒球友誼賽。</p>
<h3>約商調處中原衝突　李先念迄無答復　程潛報告共軍進攻經過</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢口三日電〕武漢黨政軍團首長，今聯合招待記者，由程主任潛，萬主席耀煌主持，程主任即席報吿稱：「共軍李先念部自六月廿六日違反羅山協定，發動大規模攻勢，率部由平漢鐵路東方，越平漢路向西猛犯，沿途襲擊國軍，殘殺民衆，燒焚房屋，其主力攻陷新野及荆紫關等地，現仍據山陽以西地區，積極備戰中。另一部攻陷宜城·南漳·保康·竹山等縣，我政府仍本和平宗旨，立派第九小組飛往老河口，以飛機送達通知，邀請李先念派代表前來，再作和平談判，一再敦促，均遭拒絕，截至目前爲止，以一股千餘，竄至竹山以西之珠玉河，其先頭竄至百忍溝（竹谿鑪坪兩縣交界處），另一股約千人由石花街西竄至武富山以南地區，企圖深人川鄂邊區，以遂其割據自雄之野心。時至今日，李先念之兇暴成性，已屬不可理喻，而政府仍抱和平未至絕望，決不放棄和平之初衷，於上月二十八日由三人小組，訂一臨時協議規定雙方暫停衝突，再邀李先念於八月五日前赴西安商談和平，此次協議之成不成，在李先念之去不去，如屆時不去，或又不派代表去，是甘心破壞和平，自絕於國人，則協議當屬無效」。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢口三日電〕駐老河口逾半月調處中原衝突之第九小組，於上月四次函邀李先念派代表赴龍駒寨與卅二小組商談，迄不獲答覆，該小組準備飛西安轉平請示前，與共方代表在老河口會談，商得一項臨時協議，暫定自二日上午四時起至廿日，爲停戰期間，協議定廿五日在西安簽字，九小紅於一日飛返漢口，三日晨上午九時由漢飛西安，無論李先念是否踐約，均將飛往北平一行。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>伊朗問題死灰復燃</h3>
<p>當印度代表薩繆爾爵士向巴黎和會發表演說，表示關心中東和平的時候，英軍突自印度開往伊拉克巴斯拉港增援，以保護英國在伊朗南部的權益。伊朗政府認爲英國此舉不啻干涉該國的內政，已向倫敦當局提出抗議。杌隉不安的中東局勢，方經數個月的平定，因此復趨於緊張。</p>
<p>在大戰勝利結束的中東，因爲伊朗內政與外交的錯綜複雜，幾度引起國際上的軒然大波，幾乎要闖出大禍，幸賴有關各國尤其是英美蘇三國，均能互相忍讓，伊朗政府也苦心孤詣的消除國內異見，始獲得暫時的安寗。但是伊期的國際環境，依然如故，不過將「明爭」改爲「暗鬥」而已。換言之，伊朗問題表面上雖獲得妥協，而英蘇在伊期的「鬥爭」實際並未停止，反且愈演愈烈。從最近幾個月來伊朗的政情看來，伊期的政治確有更加傾向蘇聯的趨勢，伊期總理塞爾泰納雖極力設法，欲處於超然地位，並領導國人組織民主黨，以與親蘇的杜德黨相抗衡，但其勢力仍不足以抵當杜德黨的深入民間，到處煽動伊朗人民的反英情緒，卒於上月十五日在伊朗南部的油田區，釀成了大規模的罷工風潮，不但英伊合辦的煤汕公司的生產，陷於停頓狀態，抑且英國在伊朗南部的權益也感受到嚴重威脅。地方當局因爲參加罷工的工人達十萬人之衆，爲維持治安計，乃宣佈緊急狀態，以爲戒備；罷工工人反而以「英國人之工具」的罪名，要求法特米省長辭職。於此，足見油鑛工潮已非尋常罷工可比，顯有其國際背境；而伊朗政府爲息事寗人起見，仍訓令法特米省長，避免與罷工工人發生衝突，這種一味姑息的態度，自亦有其不可吿人的隱痛。英國當局眼見到本國權益的漫無保障，除向伊朗政府交涉，要求其立即採取緊急措置，以保衛南部英印人民之生命財產而外，並派海軍三艘駛入波斯灣，停泊於亞巴當港外，藉以表示英國在伊期南部的利益如遭受威脅，則隨時即可有所舉動。同時，英國外相貝文也在下議院聲明，伊朗對於其境內英人之安全；應負全責。當時局勢，確曾一度緊張；可是巴勒斯坦的事件忽於此時發生，使英國視錢不得不轉移到巴勒斯坦問題上，於是伊期問題就形成外弛內張的局面。</p>
<p>在這表面沉默的兩個星期之中，伊朗的政局却急轉直下，總理塞爾泰納所領導的民主黨和親蘇的杜德黨，獲得了暫時的默契，伊朗內閣乃於上月杪總辭職，俾使塞爾泰納總埋得以另行組織新內閣，乃於本月一日吿成，左派親蘇的杜德黨有三人參加新閣，而內閣便爲「親蘇派」與「親英派」兩種勢力所平均支配了。伊朗內閣的改組，對於英國而言，顯然不利，自不待言，抑且使英國政府益感英人在伊朗南部的安全亳無保障，乃不得不採取軍事行動，保障其自身的權益。</p>
<p>英軍在伊拉克境內集中，伊期已向英國政府提出抗議，如果此事純屬於英伊兩國間的爭議，自可不必危言聳聽，而謂中東局勢又趨緊張。但在英伊衝突的幕後，還有一個强大的國家在，這就是北方毗鄰的蘇聯。她對於伊朗，决不放鬆一步，而且時局發展到目前，蘇聯在伊朗的勢力已經根深蒂固，英國將不是她的勁敵了。最近在蘇聯外交家的手中，還操有三張勝牌：（一）伊朗國王之令妹巴麗維郡主，最近訪問莫斯科，蘇聯政府曾大獻慇懃，竭盡聯絡之能事；（二）伊朗內閣總理塞爾泰納之政治顧問，也就是伊朗政府的發言人費洛慈親王，爲伊朗內閣中親蘇派代表，曾親自前往伊朗南部，將被捕的工人開釋，（三）親蘇的杜德黨，最近也加强宣傳攻勢，在新內閣中又佔有三席，其地位益見鞏固，和半年以前，不可同日而語了。</p>
<p>此在英國方面，則在伊朗的勢力，日見削弱，所可憑藉的工具，也相形見絀。再加以巴勒斯坦問題的困擾，使英國在伊朗處於進退兩難的窘境。英國如不欲保持伊朗的油權則已，否則非採取嚴峻的措置不可。英國工黨政府對於巴勒斯坦，戀戀不捨，其所持的理由，也就在此。邱吉爾攻擊工黨政府的巴勒斯坦政策，謂其舍象取鼠，固極中肯；但在目前的國際環境下，英國欲鞏固其在中東的地位，則象雖舍了，鼠還是不得不爭。</p>
<p>要之，英蘇兩國在中東的「外交戰」，已到了白熱化的階段。伊朗素有中東火藥庫之稱。英軍旣已開往伊拉克與伊朗邊界最近的地方集中，同時伊朗軍隊也有南開之說，再加以蘇聯又在幕後牽綫，大家這樣在火藥庫旁玩火，誰能保證不會燎原呢？和平的鐘聲已在巴黎不斷的響起來了，廿一國的政治外交家現都衆集在巴黎，爲防制戰禍的再起計，應先撲滅中東的這一把「星星之火」！</p>

<h3>巴黎和會昨休會一天　各代表作會外活動　表决制問題英提出折衷案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎四日廣播：今日為星期日，和會休會一天，但各代表場外之接觸頻繁，尤以表決問題最受各方注意。聞英方已提出折衷方案，內容未詳，該問題大致將於下週初決定。據一般意見，大國將以十一對十之多數佔有優勢。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎三日電〕關於和會規程委員會所當討論各事，其重要性之大，可於全體大會業已展期舉行，以待該委會完成工作一舉見之。該委會茲定於本月五日午前午後重行開會，就關係重要之投票表決所需多數一項問題，加以討論。關於此事，四強意見仍係關於程序問題，全體大會得以普通多數表決通過，其他各項問題與夫建議案，則須有三分之二多數乃得予以通過，巴西代表會經提出一切議案主張只需普通多數，即得表決通過，紐西蘭代表亦有類似之提案。英代表提出折衷方案，擬將一切建議案分為兩類，其中若干得以普通多數表決通過，其他各項則須三分二之多數乃得予以通過。凡此均當由規程委員會提付討論。此外，該委會尚當討論各種小組委員會之表決程序。關於此層，紐西蘭代表亦已提出修正案，主張各項建議案凡由小組委員會以普通多數通過者，必須提付全體大會考慮。以上各項問題，此間政治觀察家均認為極關重要，可能引起長時間之辯論。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎三日電〕今日會議之重大事件如下：（一）英代表宣稱，四強對於五國和約草案中商定之一切事件，可望成立聯合陣綫。南斯拉夫代表雖猛烈抨擊，但特里埃斯特港爭執，不致舊事重提。（二）加拿大代表團宣布，該團對於十萬萬美元之對蘇賠償一事，將提出質問，並當要求對局勢澈底檢討。澳洲亦會表示該國將採取同樣行動。</p>
<h3>和會主席問題解決　由五強輪流擔任　荷蘭提修正案被否決</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎三日電〕和會規程委員會今日下午經四小時半之討論，未經投票，即同意四強外長之建議，决定大會之主席，由中美英蘇法五強輪流担任。其先荷蘭代表建議，大會自由推選主席，當以十二票對八票被否决。美國務卿貝爾納斯在今日之辯論中曾稱，渠覺討論和約建議，較何人任大會主席尤為重要。規程委員會中投票贊成荷蘭之修正案者，有巴西，澳大利亞，比利時，希臘，印度，紐西蘭，南非及荷蘭。反對者有美國，英國，挪威，波蘭，捷克，烏克蘭，蘇聯，及南斯拉夫，棄權者阿比西尼亞。</p>
<h3>和會揷曲　電影攝影機傾倒　王外長險被擊傷</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎三日專電〕我國首席代表王世杰，本日上午險而受傷，蓋其旁有一架極鉅之電影攝影機傾跌，擊及坐於王氏後面列席規程委員會觀察員林咸讓，其左耳後受輕傷，然該攝影師因無意闖禍，已受驚不小矣。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎三日專電〕和會規程委會，今開會討論大會主席問題時，中國支持四強建議之規則，即由外長會議之五會員國輪流担任主席。王世杰於解釋中國支持此規則之理由時謂，係基於事實上之原因，在原則上中國贊成荷蘭修正案，即會議有權選出本身主席，但就實際情形加以考慮，修正若獲通過，勢將引起新的複雜問題，而不能使會議工作順利進行。該修正案仍在考慮中，俟最後決定，中國代表團基於此實際理由，亦僅由於此項理由而支持外長會議關於此事所提之建議。王氏最後稱，外長會議準備此建議時，中國並未參加。</p>
<h3>中文理應列為　和會官方語文　我代表郭泰祺提出</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎三日專電〕本日上午規程委員會開會，我國代表團為巴黎和會採用官方語文之規則問題，提出一項保留條件。四國上月所擬定之程序規則第四款內稱，「全會及委員會會議中，均以英法俄三國語文為官方及應用語文」。本日討論時，我國代表郭泰祺稱，根據聯合國憲章，中文乃五種官方語文之一，去年九月在倫敦舉行之外長會議中，亦商定重要決議及文件，應譯成中文散發各代表團，是項辦法並不額外花費會議之時間。鑒於技術上之種種困難，中國代表團並不要求巴黎和會遵照上述辦法，然希望將此事付諸紀錄，即中國確期望在未來之會議，尤其處理有關日本之遠東和平會議中，列中文為官文語文之一。</p>
<h3>盧森堡宮四週　戒備森嚴　法軍攀登屋頂日夜守望　代表所進食物均經檢查</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎三日電〕巴黎和會每次開會前，均有法軍突擊隊攀登盧森堡宮之屋頂，嚴密戒備，如發現形跡可疑份子，得光開槍，然後再向其發問。各和會代表所進食物，事前均經檢查，代表所居之二十座旅舍內，均有安全警察三名，專司檢查遞交各代表之物，以防夾帶爆炸物等。大會會場僱員及旅舍職員，均曾經警察嚴密調查，納粹份子在和會開會期間均予停職，與和會有關之人均發給特種有色派司，顏色每日不同，以防他人假借。關於和會戒備事宜，悉由法國安全警察秘書長安特雷負責人。</p>
<h3>英在伊拉克集結軍隊　伊朗政府提抗議</h3>
<p>指摘英國干涉其內政</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里三日電〕此間今日宣傳：伊朗政府維持英伊油區法律與秩序之勢力，顯已失敗，該處印度與英人生命財產及以汽油供應印度等事，皆已受其威脅，故現已有軍隊自印度開往伊拉克之巴斯拉。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社德黑蘭三日電〕官方頃宣傳：伊朗政府對於英國在伊拉克集中軍隊，本日提出抗議。據宣傳部發表公告稱，伊朗政府依照聯合國憲章暨英·伊·蘇三國條約之規定，對英軍集中巴斯拉提出抗議。據新德里發表公報稱，此次英軍集中·乃欲維持伊朗南部之治安，伊朗政府對於此種干涉伊朗內政之行為，當再度提出抗議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社德黑蘭三日電〕此間消息靈通人士頃談稱：英軍集中伊拉克之巴斯拉港一項消息傳來後，伊朗與情大為震動。外交觀察家相信伊朗組織新內閣，容納親蘇派之工黨（即杜德黨），實為英政府採取急劇措置之原因，其目的在防止伊朗南部亦即英國經濟利益所在地發生反英宣傳運動。此間左派某報稱，英軍此舉干涉伊朗內政，威脅伊朗主權，伊朗政府將向聯合國提出申訴云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦三日電〕外務部發言人向法國新聞社記者談稱，此間人士對於中東局勢之發展，並不引為驚詫。印度英軍開往伊拉克，因半月以前伊朗南部發生爭端，不得不預為之計，以免再度發生同樣事件。此項軍隊調動，乃於亞巴當城工潮發生後一日所決定，此項決定因軍略關係，保守秘書。總之，倫敦對此局勢頗為鎮靜。此外每日　報載有外交記者來電稱，英　　　伊拉克，已使局勢十分緊張，有關各方均極焦慮。</p>
<h3>義大利艦隊　甯願鑿沉　英美代表團接警告　義外長赴巴黎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦四日廣播：義大利外長今日離羅馬赴巴黎。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬四日電〕本日晨間若干報紙均以「義大利艦隊將鑿沉」為第一條新聞。據各該報稱，巴黎和會英美代表團已接到警告，謂義大利水手甯願將本國艦隊鑿沉，而不願移交其他國家。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎三日電〕義內閣副總理南尼，已在此間與法國暨其他各國政治家商談完畢，當於本月五日遄返羅馬。關於此事，消息靈通人士頃談稱，南尼並會與南斯拉夫內閣副總理，即該國代表圖團長卡台爾斯基會晤，惟未經官方加以證實。其會談詳情，雖非外間所知，據聞當係互相交換意見，並強調雙方若干政治家雖望敦睦邦交，但因雙方一般人由于疆界爭執均表反對，在目下未能予以實現。</p>
<h3>土耳其內閣　突總辭職</h3>
<p>國防部長奉命組閣</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山四日廣播，國防部長受命另組新閣</p>
<h3>英蘇在中東角逐　外交戰展開新頁</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦三日電〕英國官方已宣佈派遣軍隊前往伊拉克，英蘇兩國刻在德黑蘭所從事之外交戰，又展開一新頁。倫敦與莫斯科對於雙方在中東競爭，均不欲妥協。英外相貝文於七月十七日在下院報告，並未公開言及伊朗南部親蘇份子，舉行示威運動，以反對英伊兩國煤油公司，即以此故。莫斯科亦避不正式贊助杜德黨，亦以此故。其實雙方均在暗中向伊朗政府施行壓力，迫令其宣佈，旣不親英，亦不親蘇。英蘇兩國外交人員，與伊朗總理沙丹納交涉，勾心鬥角，均欲大顯其身手。在蘇聯方面，操有三張勝牌，（一）伊朗國王之令妹，巴麗維郡主，最近訪問莫斯科，蘇聯政府曾殷懇招待；（二）沙丹納總理之政治顧問及發言人費洛樂親王，係伊朗內閣中之親蘇代表，曾親自前往亞巴達城，將被捕工人開釋；（二）杜德黨加強其宣傳工作，其在內閣中之地位，亦益見鞏固。此在英國亦有三事可言，（一）員文外相宣佈伊朗政府對於其境內英國人民之安全，應負全責；（二）英國巡洋艦「諾爾福克」號駛往波斯灣；（三）派兵前往伊拉克與伊朗邊界接近之地區增援。</p>
<h3>蘇聯又向美國　發動宣傳攻勢</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦三日合衆電〕蘇聯與西方國家之關係，今日似又臨近一新危機，蓋蘇聯又向美國發動宣傳攻擊。克姆林宮官方抨擊美國稱，「美國正式成立新軍人階級，以控制原子彈，並建立強大武裝部隊，供採取攻勢之用。」並稱，「西方諸反動政府之詭計」，已威脅巴黎和會，而按照波茨坦協定，應用以賠償蘇聯之德境美佔領區全部工業機械，已悉被美方破壞。蘇聯名廣播評論家藍氏宣傳，吾人應牢記美國今為有史以來之第一次在和平時期，保持大量陸海空軍及原子彈，以供發動攻勢之用，美國製造原子彈之目的，當然非為自衛。</p>
<h3>和會經濟方面　美極為重視</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎四日廣播：美主力國務卿克雷頓今日發表廣播演說，內稱，自戰爭結束以來，美國曾費去二百萬萬美元，以協助國外經濟生活之復蘇，由此可見美國人對於和約經濟方面之重視。凡遭受侵略之國家固有權向侵略者要求賠償，但侵略者之賠償能力亦應考慮及之。總之，吾人不能重蹈凡爾賽和約之覆轍。</p>
<h3>美邀十一國代表　討論日賠償問題</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京四日電〕據華府息：美政府當局為討論日本賠償問題，決自十五日起召集遠東委員會參加國十一國代表，開會討論。邀請書聞已發出，美政府邀請書中，強調日投降已近一年，而賠償問題之研究工作毫未進展，又謂因不知各國究准日本保留何種工業，致令撤卸日本經濟設備之工作大為延遲云。遠東委員會十一國代表對美國此次提案在決定實施以前，均應秘而不宣。推測美政府用意，第一欲聯合國承認日本軍事工廠之分配，第二欲早日解決蘇聯對東北賠償問題之轇轕。聞美國致十一國之通牒中，提議決定賠償方式，蘇聯拆運東北工業設施一事，應加以考慮，若依據美國提案，決定各國應受賠償額之後，則蘇聯拆卸之東北工業設施之價值，恐將由蘇聯應受賠償額中扣除。又據美外交界消息靈通方面稱：蘇聯對此將猛力反對，蓋莫斯科方面始終一貫主張該項工業設備不應作一般賠償之用，而係其「戰利品」也。美賠償使節鮑萊前估測蘇聯拆運之東北工業設施，價值約達美金二十億元，又對日賠償會議將在美國舉行，將來賠償會議所有議決案，尚須交遠東委員會附議。</p>

<h3>美大文豪馬克吐溫故居（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員毛樹清寄自諾城</p>
<p>〔七月十二日航訊〕在肯薩斯停留的第四天早上，我接到國務員新聞部恩特赫先生的電報，大意說：田納西水利局方面，已經接洽妥當，叫我立即前去。原先想繼續西進到落磯山的計劃，不能不暫時放棄，因此，當天下午，我便轉道東行了。東返途中，我在漢泥畈停留了　一夜，那是一座一萬人居住的小城，濱密西西比河邊上，城的對岸是伊利諾羅州，漢泥畈本身是屬於密蘇里州的。城內有許多家大旅店，專門用於招待遊客用的，遊客爲什麽來？因為它是美國十九世紀大文豪馬克吐溫的故鄉。吐溫（馬克是名字）於一把三五年生於漢泥畈那時候，美國的文明，還在草創時代。十九世紀中，美國走在工業化的途程中，產生了不少有名的科學家和科學發明家，但在文學上，美國一向是接受着歐洲的衣缽，很少有異軍突起的人才，馬克吐溫是一個幾乎「唯一」的產品在漢泥畈，我憑吊了吐溫的木板小屋，在這座小屋裏，吐溫曾經享受過他的童年和晚年，小屋用簡陋的木板搭成，至今仍保有當年的真蹟。屋的左旁，是一塊臨街的花園，園內有草坪，有石膏像，據說是當年吐溫「構思」的地方。小屋是兩層樓的建築，樓下有客室和廚房，陳列有當年的美孚煤油燈，有蠟燭，有吐溫寫文章時飲的茶壺，廚房中有極古老式的煤爐，有很多很多中西磁器，樓上是臥室，有古色古香的沙發，還有衣架上掛着的衣服。吐溫於一九〇五年十二月五日，在漢泥畈舉行七十大壽，那是一個有名的盛會。一九一〇年，吐溫便死了。後來，這座小屋，被喬治麥罕買去，到一九一二年五月，麥罕夫婦決定贈送給漢泥畈的市政府，作紀念一代文豪之用。小屋的右側是漢泥畈的市立博物館，裏面大部份的陳列品，都是吐翁的作品，原稿，和書札。</p>
<p>吐翁有名的劇作「聖女貞德」，是在距離家不遠的一家雜貨舖樓上寫的，這家雜貨舖當年做什麽用？門前立有吐翁創作的紀念碑。馬克吐溫最著名的作品「湯姆少年」，寫一個天真的兒童故事，及其羅曼史。書中提到的湯姆的第一個愛人柏基，塞勒，便是指的吐翁家對面的一個女孩子，這位一百年以前的妙齡少女，並沒有在歷史上留有任何痕跡，如今，塞勒家的木板房子依然存在，聰明的商人把那幢房子闢為：「旅客寄宿舍」，專門吸引一般好古癖的美國人，在這兒懷古一夜·在中國，馬克吐溫的作品，也許介紹得不多。但在歐洲和美國，有人把他稱作美國的莎士比亞·吐翁死後十六年，美國的無綫電開始廣播他的作品，吐翁的戲劇在紐約上演，紐約時報用整版篇幅為之介紹。漢泥畈博物館裏，陳列着每一件有關馬克吐溫的出版和遺墨。有一本書記叙吐溫的生平，呌做「米蘇里之子—馬克吐溫」。還有一本是法國人維托寫的，書名呌做「馬克吐溫的美國」。漢泥畈是一個小城，商店，旅館，餐廳，戲院，都用馬克吐溫的名字來吸引遊客。城內有公園，夏夜有音樂演奏。</p>
<p>美國小城市居民的生活，是非常又風趣的，他們懂得怎樣安排一個「人」的生活。我在大街上徜徉，很多人用注意的眼光望着我，我知道：很多小城市的美國人，從來就沒有看見過黃種人的。離開漢泥畈的那天清早，我到密西西比河畔的「望江公園」散步，那兒有馬克吐溫的銅像，像一個巨人，雄踞在密西西比的洪流之上。從漢泥畈渡河向北走二十哩，那兒有一個伊利諾亞的中等城市，叫做「昆舍」。我在昆舍街上，匆匆巡禮一週，沒有時間停留。沈作乾領事，告訴我一段昆舍的故事：那兒有一名華僑，叫做黃三美，很早以前，在美國經商，頗積了一點財產，這位先生喜出大言，對國家大事，意見很多。抗戰開始以後，他曾經懸賞三千美金，給第一位轟炸東京的英雄。後來，美國杜立特將軍轟炸東京，他果然匯了三千元給杜夫人。</p>
<p>杜立特夫人</p>
<p>把它原璧奉還，並且說：「軍人為國家盡職，不能接受任何私人的獎勵。」黃三美弄得騎虎難下，最後想了辦法，買一具中國古董的大花瓶，送到了杜立特家中，這是一件。第二件故事是：某一次，黃三美忽然「心血來潮」，又寫信給中國政府，建議速即派遣學生，來美學習某項科學，全部留學費用，由他負担。據說：教育當局居然相信這事，特地考選了四名學生，來到美國，學生一到，黃三美忽然變卦了，聲言：「不願出此費用」，弄得使領館非常為難。計算四名學生，求學三年，全部用費約一萬多美金。大使館託人多方面問他緣由，他避不理睬，却轉託一位外國人，向使領館答覆，說中國政府「不民主，」他不願意負担這筆款子。使領館曾經要他答覆，當初爲什麽不負責任的隨便寫信？後來，其他的華僑，出來勸阻，他們說：「黃某根本是一個瘋子，何必再追究下去呢？」這件怪案子，發展到怎樣一個結果？現在尚不知道。錢有了著落沒有？我也無暇深究。我路過昆舍的日子。因為怨促，沒有去拜會這位怪華僑黃三美先生。到芝加哥是午夜，我沒有耽擱，第二天，便搭火車南下了。火車經過印第安那州的大城　變德，經過印第安那的省會「印第安那波里。」這一路，盡是一望無際的大平原，地質學家稱美國中西部的伊利諾亞，印第安那，渥亥渥幾州，稱為「黑土區」，意思即是說，那幾州最富庶，最適宜於農作。我在三州交界的大城辛辛那蒂換車，從辛辛那蒂以南，便是美國人口中的「南方」了。鐵路的公司，也叫「南方鐵道公司。」南方鐵道公司的火車和北方一樣，唯一的大區別是黑人和白人分座，進驛台的時候，站警騐票，手一揮，說「左邊門」或「右邊門」，這裏面便是一個蹊蹺。我是被派在右邊門進去的，但我並沒有想到黑白之分，看見後面的列車擁擠，便拼命往前面奔，將跨上前面的列車之際，睜眼一看盡是黑人，知道不妙，才又回奔過來，上後面的列車，車上的白人「車　」望著我微笑。記得在紐約的時候聽一位在路易西安那（南方）住得很久的朋友講故事，他剛去南方的第二天，看見廁所都分黑白，他心想中國是黃人，應該進那邊？沉思良久，上前問警察，警察把警棍向白人廁所一指，說「當然在這邊！」芝加哥三民晨報的主筆王文珏兄，他告訴我另一段相仿的故事。有一次他上南方去，火車經過某站以後，看見白人都紛紛離座，他以為他們到了目的地，下車去了。因之並不介意，隔了不久，白人都離光了。黑人男男女女，扶老携幼，越來越多。車上有一位隨車職員，走到他旁邊，輕聲附耳說：「請先生搬到後面列車。」王兄因為行李多，搬動麻煩，又因為中國人並不慣那些種族偏見，仍然坐著原位。這樣隔了很久，全車左右盡是黑人了，黑人的小孩子叫鬧聲漸漸煩囂，甚至拉屎拉尿，都在車廂坐位上行之，才覺得腥臭不堪，不是人的世界，不得已，祗好搬到後邊列車，車上的職員，笑著告訴他：「我老早對你說過的，何如？」</p>

<h3>楊文道案　辯護律師表示　前途樂觀　吳鐵城近曾函楊慰藉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據楊文道之辯護律師唐懷　稱，此次楊文道案發回更審，彼以為前　極可樂觀，深信必可平反冤獄，甚或一庭即可審結。彼於上月二十三日曾撰辯訴狀投遞高院，略謂：（一）本案重要證物「物理學教科書」一本，原係英文，後忽變為中文，而此書挖空後，即藏手槍，故「該書所以證明槍之由來，書旣不符，槍即失所附麗」。（二）原判決所採之同案嫌疑犯葉海生之自由與表演，不符事實真相，「其自白係出於刑求，其表演實憲警所導演」。未並強調稱，「回憶當時，中日關係，岌岌可危，租界當局精神上已感高度不安，以是捕房偵查，益變本而加厲，不惜造成冤獄。十載以還，精神身體，兩受痛苦，物質上之損失，尤不堪計算」云云。</p>
<p>至最近法院票傳到案詢問之證人十一人，係（一）郭啟明，十年前上海廣東同鄉會代楊所請之律師；（二）張志讓，當時法院指定為楊義務辯護之律師；（三）張師竹，當年之捕房律師；（四）魏立功，法醫；（五）李暮，昔年將自衛手槍借與楊文道者；（六）楊建中，係楊文道之族姪，曾向日探長首告楊文道為本案凶犯；（七）張琛，係對楊文道有利之證人，惟聞已於上海淪陷期中為日憲兵捕殺；（八）曾元，又名曾元佳，與楊建中同向日方首告者；（九）鄭偉民，此人自稱為日人平山元一，係堅持楊為凶手之證人，惟聞已於數年前在廣州將淪陷時因充當漢奸為當局槍決；（十）克勞索，西探；（十一）陳榮生，楊文道之僕，現不在滬。據楊之家屬稱，當年尚有率領便衣日警拘捕楊文道之指證人譚振，高院以次未加票傳，想係遺漏，聞吳鐵城氏近曾致函楊文道，頗表慰藉之意，因昔年案發之時，吳氏任上海市長，日人欲造成事件，曾刑逼楊文道誣攀吳氏主使，而楊始終不為所屈也。</p>

<h3>刦除紗布發還問題　公會向清查團呼籲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪染織，棉紗，棉布三業公會負責人，探詢關於刦餘紗布發還問題。據談：此次接收工作清查團來滬之初，三公會即聯名呈文要求清查及發還敵偽強迫收賣紗布之剩餘額，上週清查團邀　各業談話時，三業又推派代表當面陳述，並再備文提供資料，建議請清查團查閱敵產處理審議委員會歷次會議記錄，及詳查刦餘紗布之處理情形，共被出售多少，續向被害廠號提取多少，（因偽商統不及提取寄存於原廠號）。四千五百家被害廠號勝利後委託公會向政府力爭發還者，已在十分之八以上，各被害商現執有偽商統會強迫收賣後發給之偽中儲行定期存單在手，迄勝利止，尚有四分之一價款未發給，據公會調查刦餘紗布額，為布二百萬匹，紗一萬餘件，亦恰為總收賣數之四分之一，若照時值估價，當在一千六百萬萬元以上。若照敵偽產業處理局之處理辦法，每匹布僅需發給法幣四角六分八厘，蓋其根據當時敵偽強迫收賣時所定之貨價，以二百比一之比率，由偽幣折合，若照此數發給，則近乎滑稽矣。故同業對此辦法，皆抵死反對。清查團到申後，各該委託人極力敦促公會據理力爭，以求發還，但聞公會方面對一千六百億之估價，並不堅持云。又悉本市商會，工業協會及各業代表將組織之晋京請願團，三公會亦擬推派代表隨同晋京，向最高當局呼籲。</p>

<h3>投考難　難於上青天　名額有限擁擠空前　學生充滿失學恐慌</h3>
<p>投考難，難於上青天！</p>
<p>幾許暑假中，稱羣的學生，自中學畢業，一批批的考進大學。雖然說考大學不太簡易，但是凡屬水準以上的學生，「打回票」的機會，畢竟是少數中的少數！然而今年不同了，學校鬧着普遍的恐慌，每個學校都有人滿之患，尤其是那些來滬招生的國立大學，它們名額有限，而報名投考的學生，往往超過了千百倍，這種空前擁擠的現象，讓斷學生吃驚，恐慌！他們都在喊：投考難，難於上青天！</p>
<p>地板踏穿門窗破　報名蠭擁如衝鋒</p>
<p>今年來滬招生的國立大學，有燕京，聯大，（清華，南開，北大。）廈門，及國立社會教育學院等。而報名者的踴躍，是出乎任何人意料之外的。其中最早招考的是燕京，報名的地點在中西女中。中西女中向以建築雄偉專名海上的，但是在燕京開始報名的第一天，便把辦公室裏的地板踏穿！而聯大的情形更見緊張，報名的第一天，拂曉六時，就有學生佇候在山海關路育才中學的校門口，大門一開，蜂擁而前，門窗都為之擠倒。辦事人措手不及，無法應付，所以臨時變通辦法，先發編號的報名證，依着號碼的先後，分期憑證再報名。同時為維持當天的秩序起見，依次排隊，領證，那天有似長蛇陣的隊列，比之往昔的爭買配給米絕對沒有兩樣。學生們站上好半天，拿到的僅是張報名證，等到指定的日子，再前往報名，但是考試的日期和地點還須靜待校方的通知書，因為報名的人實在太多了。「聯大」除決定分為三次舉行外，還得尋覓可以容納這些學生的考場，但是直到今日為止，還沒有找到。而學生們的心情是矛盾的，他們焦待着考試日期的到來，而又恐懼着考與不考沒有多大的分別，因為錄取的希望是太微小了。「聯大」本學期新生的最大容量是二千人，但報名投考的已達二萬人，用比例來計算一下，難怪學生們要着慌了。</p>
<p>學費低廉推國大　清寒學子稱救星</p>
<p>這種擁擠現象，在國立大學更形顯著，原是意中的事，因為國立大學的聲譽好，而學費低廉，如復旦大學等，學費僅收五百元，加上一切雜費，不過二千元，對於一般清寒的學生，視為唯一的救星。同時國立大學都各有所專，所以更是一些潛心求學的學生所嚮往，通常如念新聞系的爭着考燕京，念工科的爭考清華，念法科的爭考北大。…但是問題在於上海一般私立大學，也未能例外，這學期各校的報名人數，平均都在以往的三倍以上。如滬江大學第一次投考人數約一千二百人，錄取二百名。聖約翰大學也因為投考學生衆多，所以錄取的標準非常嚴格，聽說素來幾隻出名的中學，這次投考的學生，什九都被淘汰了。</p>
<p>粥少僧多莫奈何　試場處處熟面孔</p>
<p>造成這種不合理現象的主要原因，自然是由於復員聲中，學生　集京滬綫上所致。但是另外有個最大的原因，是學生重複的向各校投考。因為看到報名者這樣踴躍，所以學生大起恐慌，於是只得存着僥倖的心理，到各校去試試運氣。據記者所知，正有大批學生準備趕往南京考中央大學及金陵大學。所以結果碰來碰去，都是這幾只熟面孔！這種事實的後果，必然使各校錄取的學生也是重複的，因為成績優越的學生，被錄取的機會究竟多些，那麼餘下的那些成績較差的大多數學生，將往那裏去呢？</p>
<p>現在，各校的招生，都還正是開始的時期，駐滬招生的某校，除燕京已考試外，其他各校連考試的日期及地點都尚未決定，而考過之後，將這偌大數量的考卷，運往原校地，由各教授分別批閱，其揭曉的日子，真是遙遙無期了！這些彷徨在歧途上的學子，何處是他們的歸宿呢？</p>
<p>招生考試在今年，是「空前」的，但願，它也是「絕後」的！</p>

<h3>建屋萬幢　需經費一千億</h3>

<p>〔本報鎭江訊〕勝利後，各地小學敎科用書，因供不應求，在寒假開學時，曾一度成爲嚴重之問題。江蘇敎育廳深恐此種嚴重現象，於暑假後重演，特與國定本敎科書七家聯合供應處，訂定供應辦法，使全省各地，不致再發生書荒。至初中以上無國定本之各科敎本仍暫准各校自由採用各書局之審定本。茲探誌該廳國定本敎科書供應辦法，大要如下：（一）本年度秋季國定本敎科書，除省立中學樣自行洽　外，所有縣（市）公私立中等學校國定教科書四種（公民·國文·歷史·地理），及小學國定敎科書全部，由教育廳通令各縣（市）政府，嚴密調査統計各校各年級用書數量。（二）各縣市政府或敎育局，奉令後應即與當地書局接洽，指定一書局或各書局機構，承辦供應敎科書事宜。（三）承辦書局，應開貝本縣（市）所需教科書種穎，及數量總　，送由縣（市）政府加　縣（市）印，件為向指定之供應站定書之憑證。</p>
<p>兩期付款</p>
<p>（四）各種國定本敎科書價照敎育部核定價格百分之八十五計算，由承辦書局向國定中小學敎科書七家聯合供應處定購，預繳實價總額百分之二十，此款交由所在地江蘇銀行或江蘇農民銀行，收存七聯處上海供應委員會戶（無銀行之縣（市），應向後開供應站所在地之江蘇銀行，或江蘇農民銀行繳款。）以銀行收據及縣（市）政府蓋印之　單，向指定供應站換取定書單。（五）七聯供應處應將各縣（市）承辦書局所定之敎科書，於八月二十。以前運至各供應站。各縣市承辦書局，應於九月一日以憑定書單繳款，將敎科書運至本縣（市）。再由各校向學生收集書款，據蓋有校鈐之書單，向承辦書局購領分發。</p>

<h3>油風潮之前因後果　無特殊刺激供求無問題　油行請求改善配售辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食油爲主要日用品之一。近來亦因供求失調，引起軒然大波。幸賴各關係方面處理得法，形勢漸緩和，茲據記者査訪所及。此後本市之食油問題，將日趨明朗化。其價格或因供給之增加，可望益趨合理化。</p>
<p>識者均謂此次食油風波之來，並非偶然。蓋：（一）存底日枯。緣自本年三月以來，油價始終平穩。一般囤戶，以不堪喑息之負担，已陸續拋售予各食油零售店。（二）交通阻隔。靑島大連蘇北各地，原均有大宗食油供給本市。現因地方不靖，影響正常供應量，來源時斷時續。（三）實銷仍暢。本市各散戶搜購頗殷，加以廣甬各帮，亦時來採辦。（四）本街各廠產量，未復常軌。統計民營油廠七家之總產量，已較戰前减低半數。（五）近因係上月杪油價方步步高漲時，中國植物油廠於市塲配售食油，但數量有限，而申請配售者則紛至沓來，在此僧多粥少之情形下，原定配售辦法曾一度臨時取銷。</p>
<p>不意上月杪之市塲，竟承此近因之刺激，而使食油積漸之疾，乘此併發。影響所及，油市因格於當局抑價規定，竟吿無市，停業達三日之久。黑市遂應運而起。計各檔食油黑市之最高價，生油每担叩九萬元大關，豆油每担達八萬元，菜油每祖亦達七萬元。</p>
<p>官商兩方面共同平市價</p>
<p>本市社會局以　此事關係民生，曾於七月廿九日，由該局吉科長召見油糧商代表楊鳴周等，囑以顧全民食，迅速恢復營業。同時油糧公會各負責人，亦會同榨油業方面，召開聯席會議，決議於七月卅一日起，市塲恢復正常營業。一方面復根據產地成本，審議生油市價，每祖不得超過八萬五千元，豆油市價，每担不得超過八萬元。菜油市價，每担不得超過七萬三千元。該項審議價格，當經社會局予以批准，同時，復訓令油糧公會，着對市塲上所有業已成交之油糧棧單，一律限於一星期內辦理出貨手績。嗣後棧單交易，不得超過十天。藉以防止不正常及踢皮球之交易。</p>
<p>直接配售者　國營兩油廠</p>
<p>經濟部中國植物油廠，亦積極將食油配售予各零售店。此項零售店，計共六百家。分爲甲乙丙三組，已迭誌本報，此外，糧食部中國食油公司，亦直接以生油，配售予各零售商；每週一次，每次每家少則四桶左右，多則十桶左右，並非一成不變，配售價大致較市略低數千元。</p>
<p>七廠日產量供本埠有餘</p>
<p>食油風波因此項措置，漸趨平靜。油價亦不抑自平，據熟悉油業者談：本市每日對食油之耗費量，約爲一千担。茲査本市民營之榨油廠，共有大有餘·大昌新·大生·大德新·長德·爲民·及順餘等七家。該七廠戰前之生產總量，每日約可出油兩千担。近來之生產總量，約减低一半，惟每日仍可出油一千餘担。此項產品中，生油約佔三成，菜油約佔七成。故單以此七廠之生產量總量而言，供應全市食油需用，已綽有餘裕。此外中國植物油廠方面，按目前之供電量計，仍可日產食油七百餘担。一旦電力恢復全面供應，產量更屬有增無减。中國食油公司方面，目前存油亦達三四千桶之多。故就本市自身生產食油之能力而立，本市食油之源源無限制供給，可謂絕無問題。</p>
<p>青運等來貨靠物物交換</p>
<p>次會外埠對本市食油之供應情形，可分遠道近道而言。遠道來源，以大連靑島兩地居大宗。惟該兩地近因地方不靖，交通阻隔，致來源日吿呆滯。加以運轍工具，均假手於風帆船，船期不能確定。交易對象，十九均採物物交換制。例如大連一地，須以苞米小麥等物資交換。靑島各小口岸，則須以日用品·花衣·棉布等物資交換。最近二週來，自大連一地運抵本市之豆油，不過五六百桶，約合二千餘担。靑島方面，近日因該地生油行市，每担須七萬六千元。運滬時再加桶費，耗漏，拆息什費等，每祖約二萬元，估計除桶後每担之凈成本，已達九萬元。而日來滬地生油市價，每担不過八萬元，故無法運滬銷售。最近且因各運輸帆船，例須於此時修繕刷新，故運油之船隻，亦趨减少，此亦不無影響食油之來源。</p>
<p>常錫等來貨隨市價轉移</p>
<p>近道來源如無錫常州一帶，戰前向仰本市供給食油。戰後曾囚本市食油飛漲，而錫常一帶，頗多舊式油坊，自榨食油，市價一有時較滬反廉。故有時亦有一部份食油裝運來滬。惟近來該兩地豆油行市，每担約須七萬六千元。再加什費七八千元，運滬後成本每祖已達八萬二三千元，致亦無法運滬銷售。故錫常一帶與滬市盒油供需之關係，純視兩地油價之高低而定。至蘇州松江一帶，目前尚談不到以食油供應本市。</p>
<p>據上以觀，本市仰給於外埠食油之途，目前仍未能存奢望之心。惟果能恢復地方秩序，疏暢交通，則增加外埠來源後，於本市食汕問題，亦將多一重安定之因素。</p>
<p>直接配售後油和感苦悶</p>
<p>本市食油問題現雖吿一段落。惟油糧公會方面所屬之油行七八十家，又以訴苦之聲聞矣。綠此項油行，平日向在市塲居間代各買賣，藉以博取佣金。茲以中國植物油廠及中國食油公司配售食油，均未假油行之手，直接配售予各零售商·此舉在中國植物油廠及中國食油公司之立塲書，係爲簡化配售手續，並使價格單純而低廉，使一般市民，能普遍受事。惟影響所及，此七八十家油行之生計，因無業務經當，而感威脅。加以青島各地之食油，依目前本市食油之市價計，實無法採辦運銷，故油商咸感苦悶。聞現已呈請社會局，要求改善中國植物油廠等之配售辦法。同時設法鼓勵各行商赴各產區購辦食油，來滬運銷，以維油商生計云</p>
<h3>華達呢　銷路發動</h3>
<p>華達呢近來漸當銷令，遠路諸客幫慶續問訊採辦，因係繁銷之大路貨，故其通常行情，遠較其他呢羢花色貨類扎硬，寅體財神虎牌子占最重要地位，華輪交通　第二，其他什牌各檔華達呢漲跌，大半均視此二牌爲轉移，蓋內地遠近各路客幫採辦，莫不均以此二牌爲準也，顏色方面，仍以草綠爲最暢銷，藏靑殿二，元色爲次，售價方面，廠方與號方鋻於行銷之暢滯關係，同牌一號質地之貨品，每碼貴賤相差數千元，現寅豐草綠華達呢公茶會上喊沽七萬元，藏靑色六萬二千五百元，元靑色爲五萬五六千元，又古舊之靑灰及藍灰華達呢，近來亦此嗶嘰，復又翻新盛行矣。</p>
<h3>桐油自渝至滬運費　十倍於由滬運美國</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕據購買中國桐油之美國商人指稱：桐油在美國供應不暢，其主要原因，係因中國產地至出口地點運輸遲緩及運費高昂之故。桐油之市價並無漲落，仍爲散裝每磅美金三十八3/8分，桶裝每磅三十九至四十一分。由於物價統制恢復之故，商人對於訂購桐油均抱觀望態度。據最近中國方面消息，漢口及其他內地桐油已吿漲價。自重慶運貨至滬約需兩個月時間，運費爲華幣三萬元（約合美金十五元），較之自滬至美國之海運率高約十借之鉅。此間商人希望美國最近以適於內河航行之船隻撥給中國以後，則長江貨運當可加速。刻在中國之美國農業使節團正設法增加桐油生產量，擬自目前之四萬噸增至戰前生產量七萬五千噸以上，俾中國及購買國均蒙其利。</p>

<h3>染織業瀕危之因素　近切救濟兩項辦法　該業分呈財經兩部之內容</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕目前工業惟紡織業可支持，尤以紡紗一項，較爲優裕，但染織業並無紡紗設備，其紗廠之兼營織布者，亦不入該業範圍，緣該業係單純染廠，單純織廠，及染色織布工廠之總稱，其情形與紗廠業不同，自敵偽強迫收買紗布，受害最重者，即爲染織及棉布棉紗之販賣商業，而染織業因高利壓迫，更屬不支，近以危機迫切，分呈經濟及財政二部，請求救濟，茲節錄其內容如左。</p>
<p>査機器染織工業，創始迄今，已歷四十餘年，爲輕工業中歷史最久基礎較具之工業，在戰前上海一區，計有廠數一。二〇〇家，染機一·六〇對，織機三〇·〇〇〇台，工人一二〇·〇〇〇人，日產量織布六〇·〇〇〇，染布一六〇。〇〇〇，爲國內輕工業之重心，但自勝利以還，染織工業復工各廠，困難叢生，同陷絕境，未開工者，更一籌莫展，坐而待斃，按照現有生產量，僅及戰前半數，考其所遭遇危機之因素，厥爲</p>
<p>（一）抗戰特別損失</p>
<p>三十二年八月敵偽强迫征購紗布，染織工廠首當其衝、訐被強刦紗三·四〇〇件，布九九九。四〇七匹，計損失二九·一二七·二六七·一〇〇元，合運用資本比率，達百分之七六。</p>
<p>（二）資金枯乏　利息過高</p>
<p>按工業生產過程，需時較緩，資金周轉亦迂，不若商業之迅捷，機器染織工業照目前運用，即最小工廠，每月亦需流動資金五千萬元，設以二角利息計算，每月已達一千萬元之鉅，今開工廠共計四五三家，平均月供流動金一萬萬元，計共需四百五十三萬萬元，利息支出需九十萬萬六千萬元，設以坯布每匹成本五萬元計，可織成布十八萬一千二百匹，高利貸壓迫旣重，售價亦貴，五六月份上海市府公佈之生活指數中，亦以衣着一項數字最高，即爲明證。</p>
<p>（三）原料昂貴　困難加工</p>
<p>按勝利之初，二十支紗每件僅十二萬左右，六月份平均扯價則爲百二十萬元，高至十倍以上，癥結所在，無非紗價漫無管制，國營紡建公司囊括潤利之所致而棉製品工業如紗一件可織布三十四匹，以每件二十支紗價一百二十萬元計算，則原料一項已需三萬五千餘元，他如動力工資捐稅高利等一應廠繳，在在促使成本提高，而布匹僅售五萬左右，是以不僅無利可獲，甚至蝕虧血本。</p>
<p>綜上三點，吾機器染織工業之危機，實由於被敵偽强刦，資金短細，高利壓迫，原料昂貴之所致，急救之方，則唯有</p>
<p>（一）迅予發選　刦餘紗布</p>
<p>此項剩餘紗布原爲被害廠商之所有，絕非敵偽物資，曾經同業公會，一再呈請處理當局請求發還，迄今未蒙照准，要知發還紗布，即所以昭蘇染織工業之元氣，充實生產之資力，亦即爲挽救危機之要着，是以應請轉飭迅予發還。</p>
<p>（二）急辦染織　工業貸欵</p>
<p>四聯總處所舉辦之工業貸欵，染織同業雖亦曾向請求，類多並無答復，即有三數家蒙邀核准者，亦迄未發欵，催請發欵，亦未奉復，邇且有以工貸足以助長通貨膨脹，予以停辦之議，詎知工廠停頓，工業危機，全係資金缺乏，獲得貸欵，自必先將高利貸歸遝，通貨正可因此收縮，絕無助長膨脹之可言，染織工業貸欸所需，則爲添置設備，採購原料，而大宗原料即爲中紡公司之紗布，德孚洋行之染料，一爲國營，一爲敵產，是以貸欵用途，旣屬概歸正軌，又爲國營收益，更無膨脹可慮。</p>
<p>爲此將染織工業危機，曁挽救之方，陳祈鑒賜轉飭四聯總處，迅予舉辦染織工業貸欵，幷簡化貸欵手續，俾資急救，而利生產。</p>

<h3>精神病院內幕</h3>
<p>— 本報記者索貝撰文　廷鵬創碩攝影</p>
<p>鄕村人很少患精神病。他們過着淸淡的生活，勞力多，勞心少，旣不常胡思亂想，也沒有過高的慾望，所以有許多醫生對記者說，精神病其實是一種文明病。同樣理由，精神病者在美國，也在逐年增加中。據七月號「雜誌文摘」，社魯門最近在國會宜稱：「美國至少有二百萬人患精神病。至少有一千萬人，在他們一生中，有一個時期，需要住入精神病院」。</p>
<p>全美各醫院病床半數是精神病人</p>
<p>「全美國醫院病床，有百分之四十七，被精神病者所佔用；在麻省與紐約，每一百五十人中有一人患精神病，又在每一百個成人中，至少有一個人，他的一生中，有一個時期罹患精神病」。</p>
<p>這是中華紅十字會精神病科主任醫師張沅昌先生最近所接獲的美國醫界方面的報吿。</p>
<p>上海，極度畸形繁榮的都市，在今日，精神病患者，也已比戰前增多了。但社會上對此很少認識，有許多輕微的神經病，輕性躁狂症，（包括目中無人，盛氣凌人的自大者），都被認爲性情孤僻，不認爲是病態。前些日子，有一個靑年舞客，在某舞場中强佔人家的位子，與其他舞客發生衝突，結果被打得頭破血流，依然倔强不服，捉到警局去，也還不「賣賬」，結果，警局把他送到紅十字會去醫傷，後經紅十字會交精神病科醫治。這一病人，就是一個極度自大的精神病者。</p>
<p>上海的精神病院陸伯鴻先生手創</p>
<p>上海有一家規模極大的精神病院，病人近三百，包括各個國籍人士，院內設備極好，但却很少人知道它。這醫院就是普慈療養院，位於滬閔長途汽車路北橋汽車站北首離閔行不遠。它是已故陸伯鴻先生在十一年前創立的，天主敎慈愛會及天主敎福利事業委員會爲背景，陸先生被暗殺後，由其公子英耕先生繼辦。它雖名爲療養院，實際上却是精神病院。爲何不叫精神病院，其用心良苦：因爲有的病人家屬，認爲把家人送到精神病院或瘋人院，是不名譽的。</p>
<p>普慈療養院建築及環境，雄偉淸幽，即使暴躁頑强的病人，一走進院門，我想也要心曠神怡。</p>
<p>這里面，五六幢病房，分設四等，頭等收費，每日不到二萬元，（包括每日三餐一點心以及雜費），二等一萬元，三等七千元，四等免費。</p>
<p>說起免費，其實不只四等爲然，目前已有一百五十個病人分文不付；這之中，包括從前由工部局送來的馬路瘋子，還有，與醫院歷史同其悠久的病人。他們沒地方去，病也沒有好，當然只好由醫院收容了。</p>
<p>有三十餘位病人，因治療過晚，（約在病發後二三年始送院，）已無治愈之望。這些失望之羣，納於另外一座樓房的病室中。這些人雖仍患精神病，但已不暴躁，思想大概已陷於胡亂的靜止狀態，不大發言，也不大走動。有一個女的修道士，發病後住院療養無效，現在，終日拱手呆立，口中唸唸有詞，但不出聲，對人常作微笑，床上經常放置着許多本子，本子上寫着不可思議的文字，間有「我是聖王」一類的一字樣。</p>
<p>患神經病者見醫師檢査病房時，叨擾在談。醫師在其言無倫次中，亦可探得其病源之一部。</p>
<p>精神病科病者在玩骨牌</p>
<p>中外精神病患者　形形色色令人笑</p>
<p>全部病人，共二百八十六名，其中外籍人士計五十六人，包括英，葡，俄，希臘，猶太等國籍，猶太人居多。有一個希臘病人，自小患精神病，恐爲先天性。此人無牙齒，身體外表頗壯大，始終未發一語，終日不斷以右手擊拍左拳，因而左拳皮膚都起了變化。記者要拍他的照，他很快地逃走了。據說，這一個希臘人，父經商，頗富有。他是「獨生子，」自小極爲父母溺愛，但他的母親却已被他　死。</p>
<p>走進病房，奇奇怪怪的形形色色，不會使你發笑，卻令人想着：人間為何偏多悲劇？這些病人，幸福圈外的苦惱者，也許當年都有過一番美滿的際遇，而今却都是悲劇的主角。「是投機失敗而致發瘋的多，還是情塲失意而致發瘋的多？」我這樣地問劉貽德醫師（精神病專家）。「最近，有許多都是投機失敗而得病的。」他的答案如比。</p>
<p>接着，有一個病人對記者說：「上海方面請他結賬！結賬！！…」據說這病人逢人便要結賬。</p>
<p>病房設備並無很大特點與異樣，因爲不能增加病人神經上的刺激。明知玻璃窓常會犧牲於病人手中，但你不能加上鐵絲網，使病家覺得坐監獄一樣。在這里，病房窗門僅僅加上了美麗岡案的鐵條，目的在防護玻璃，而不着痕跡。在美國，他們用的是不碎玻璃。這里，病人的餐室也佈置得極美麗，白罩桌布，花瓶，圖畫，非常藝術化。</p>
<p>病人分文武兩類：文的是「思想家」，「藝術家」，自我發瘋，不管別人，弄音樂，畫圖畫。病房的牆上被點綴以很好的作品。武的則反是，他們動手動脚澴動口。大概剛進院的病人，比較武一點，動手打人的不在少數，醫院方面，除了由護士陪伴他們外，十分暴躁的，暫時給帶上兩手串在一起的皮手套，使無法動手。</p>
<p>他們日常生活，很有規律，每天都有室外活動。喜歡宗敎的或本爲敎徒的，禮拜天就在院內做禮拜。外來信件均經院方檢査，認爲對病人精神有刺激的，加以檢扣。</p>
<p>普慈神經病院病房外景</p>
<p>（上）患神經病者，在病房中以其所寫作品及收　之　　，鋪置床上，靜坐朗讀之時　（下）終日睡臥床上，口中念念不休之患神經病者。</p>
<p>院方經費不寬裕　靠教會紅會資助</p>
<p>醫院雖然規模大，但因非營業性質，幾乎半數的病人，無力付費，即付費病人，為數亦甚有限，病人破壞物件又在所難免，所以院方經費亦不太寬裕，全靠敎會及院長設法。因此，英國紅十字會，美軍方面，對該院都有捐助，美軍方面並送了許多英文雜誌，供病人閱讀。院方希望能獲到中文報章的贈閱，以供華籍病家之用。</p>
<p>由於經費困難，院方正與市衛生局商量那些無力付費而治療無望的長期收留問題。誠然，那些失望之羣，對社會已無貢獻，但於人道立塲，政府對於殘廢者應富有所救濟。</p>
<p>普慈療養院，成立於民國二十四年六月，係已故陸伯鴻所創辦，在閔行北橋鎭附近。</p>
<p>收復地區土地權利清理辦法</p>
<p>收復區土地權利，由於淪陷時期敵偽之擾亂與變更，至勝利後，時起糾紛，政府爲保護原有土地所有權人之合法權利，已制定收復地區土地權利淸理辦法公佈，以爲辦理收復地區土地權利淸理之依據。該辦法規定：土地權利所執產權憑證，限於下列四條款：即（一）依法辦理土地登記所發之土地權利書狀，（二）依法辦理土地陳報所發之土地營業執照，（三）依其他法令整理地籍所頒發之土地權利證件，及（四）未經依法令整理地籍之地方，人民土地權利原有之證件。至敵偽組織對於公司於土地爲之處分，及其所發給土地權利證件，一律無效。土地權利人所有之證件，經加蓋敵偽組織印信者，於淸理時，在原敵偽印信上，加蓋「無效」戳記，對於放領之公有土地，亦一律無效。但其受領人，爲自耕農，而繼續耕作者，可限期重辦承領手績，並免予繳價，對於沒收或强佔之私有土地，由所有權人提出產權憑證發還，所有權人不能提出產權憑證時，得取縣鄕鎭保甲長，或四鄰之證明書爲之，對於給價征收之私有土地，由政府保管淸理，得准所有權人提出確切證據，以徵收時所領金額，按月發物價指數繳價領回，對於敵國人民或漢奸强佔之私有土地，原土地所有人權，提出產權證據時，得予以發還，而在戰事期間，市縣政府不能行使政權之地方，土地權利之轉移，應由土地權利承受人，於地方收復政府公開施行政權六個月內，依法向該管市縣政府補行登記，在尚未辦理土地登記之地方，應補行稅契，至執行土地權利淸理機關，由縣市政府爲之，但其由敵偽產業處理局接收之土地，由該局會同縣市政府共同淸理。〔中央社〕</p>
<p>紅十字會精神病平主任醫師張沅昌</p>
<p>護士們任勞任怨　不辭病人的打罵</p>
<p>最令人感動的是三個醫生和護士們。（護士二十餘位，十二位是修道士），他們靜靜地在城市的圈外，犧牲自己的享受，醫療發瘋的病人。護士們不辭病人的打駡，時時刻刻注意着病人的行動，任勞任怨，難能可貴。病人撕毀了被單，打碎了窗子，發足了脾氣，也只得好好地爲他收拾。</p>
<p>慈愛會院畏董先生，法國籍，負着院內的實際責任。他已六十歲，但看樣子只有四十歲。日人侵佔上海時期，曾一度被捕，且遭吊起來打，釋放後，頸間長一瘤，現已痊愈。他說這醫院於淪陷時期選能存在的主要原因，是有許多日本精神病人也在院內。</p>
<p>病理病源及療法　日新月異進步中</p>
<p>關於精神病的原因，有先天的，後天的，及生理的心理的三種分別。主要的是自已控制力太差，不能應付意外打擊所使然。因其他高熱疾病使腦神經受傷而致病的，因梅毒而致病的也有。其治療方法，有醫藥治療與工作治療兩種。醫藥注射用的，有三種藥：（一）因蘇林，（二）虐疾血，（三）加的索爾。第一種藥係採用人身胰素所製，注射後使病人發高熱而至於昏迷，安靜。暴躁，病人初入醫院，多用此藥。第二種用於因花柳病菌侵入腦部的病人，此所謂以毒攻毒。第三種藥之注射，使病人發生病　，然後思想可以淸醒、但反應强，病人甚苦。</p>
<p>精神病治療的學說，近年來以心理分析家福萊埃特的說法，最受重視，他的觀點是「性」。他說，由於性方面的過分壓制，使他潛伏於下意識裏的某種慾聖，換了一偭方式發洩出來，因此成了瘋子。有一個例子可以說明：曾經有一個病人，一天到晚，把脚用力地在地上踏，時刻不斷，病者自已亦不知所以然。後來，一個醫生在他夢裏分析出來，他愛上了嫂子，無法如願。醫生把這一心底的謎拆穿了病人即復原。福氏這一學說全以性爲出發點，他認爲女子擇偶，常以自已父親爲標準，男子擇偶，常以自己母親爲標準。據普慈療養院醫生說，這一學說，數年前曾引起他們的注意和研究，現在，大家認爲這學說太偏袒了。</p>
<p>患神經病者，終日呆坐，不發一言。見有人至，即起立鞠躬後呆坐。</p>
<p>病人心理納正軌是最有效的療法</p>
<p>最新的治療法，據說注重在分析病人的心理。（如果屬於後天性的精神病。）許多病者，因爲想得到的東西沒有得到，而致患精神病，那麽醫療方法，應當對準病的根源。最新的治法，固不單靠藥物，把病人心理引入正軌，該是最有效的辦法。比如工作治療，用類似中國七巧板之類的器具，測騐病人心理，感導病人思想等，都是較進步的方法。在美國，國家每年以七萬萬三千八百五十萬美元的經費用在精神病者身上，足見政府之重視，他們的治療法，當然是日新月異的。</p>
<p>以上報導，着重於普慈療養院，因爲它是遠東唯一完備精神病院。而許多家庭裏有人患精神病，都不知送往何處。</p>
<p>紅會的神經病科設有三十個病床</p>
<p>在上海市區，還有中華紅十字會的神經病科，也有三十個病床。至於「上海瘋人病院」，因係私人所辦，經費極困難，雖有廿餘年歷史，而現在情况極差，記者曾訪該院，但幾乎無可資報導者。</p>
<p>「精神病，文明病。文明社會里的人們，應當注意心理健康。」這是精神病專科醫生劉貽德的話。「能够控制自己，適應環境，合於大多數人的標準，這種人沒有精神病！能够享受，但也能吃苦，不因外來的刺激而自己不能主宰自己！這種人，我們認爲他身心最健全，人格最高！精神病的發生，主要的還是自己健全與否，外來刺激，不過是導火錢！」這是另一精神病科醫生張沅昌的話。這些話，似亦足供參考</p>

<h3>花柳醫院</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　鼎山</p>
<p>正像賭塲附近圍繞着設有無數當舖和押店一樣，西蔽路二馬路三馬路所謂「風化區」一帶，便多的是花柳病院。</p>
<p>一個輸了的賭徒跨出賭塲門口，便可脫下手錠，金戒，長衫，向當舖換作賭本，以備再接再厲，在他認爲無論如何，是一個方便。對於高利剝削，是置之不問的。</p>
<p>同樣的，對於一些愛好尋花問柳者，在事前先至附近醫院打上一針預防針，萬一事後毒發，而打六〇六，這些價廉而又「保治斷根」的醫院，就是他們的絕好去處。</p>
<p>然而，恕我對某些「留學德國」或「留學美國」的「醫學博士」說一句不敬的話，花柳和肺癆一樣，是他們唯一糊口發財的捷徑。多多少少的博士就依賴着妓女，舞女等，皮肉出賣者作爲一條活路。</p>
<p>在「風化區」內，你隨時隨地會看到一間小小的門面，白漆的玻窗寫着「包治白濁，梅毒」等字樣。假定你是一個病人，跑進那白色的骯髒的門檻，你會發現道是一間雜亂的小會客室，在這時，你把「醫院」的感覺失去了。聰明的醫生用板壁把一個小室分成二間，里面的一間是診室，道大概是世界上最小最擁擠的醫院了。雜亂的傢具和醫具，擠得連二三人容身的可能也沒有。道時你如果向醫生說，我患的是白濁，他會馬上叫你脫下褲子來。（這時你已經付過一千元掛號費。）其次，他要你騐血，他把你的血抽去很多，你要付的騐血費大概是四五千元。他把血拿到專門的化騐所去，從那邊他可以得到騐血費的回佣。</p>
<p>第三步，他就要恐嚇你了，他說你患的是相當重的梅毒，不過經他醫後；馬上會好，他的話說得很圓滑。你患下疳，他會說，軟性三天保愈，而硬性，也收口極易。你患白濁，他會說，急性一針就見效，慢性也能迅速斷根。他要你打針，針藥費是隨他開的。如果你實在沒有病，他會用葡萄糖來代替。梅毒的針藥各有成份，看人的體格分〇·四，〇·四五，〇·六等，多種，他們也會在針藥上面取巧，驅你金錢。因爲你在外賣藥，他們是不歡迎的。</p>
<p>有些廣吿醫生，以廉價號召。如果照他們所說，那運成本亦不够。欲求其貨眞而斷根，又如何可能？在過去，醫師公會曾有限制會負刋登長期廣吿的規定，然而如今，這規定已無形取消，而這些醫生大多沒有加入公會，所以亦不需受這規定的限制了。</p>
<p>上海的花枊醫生，大約楞分四種：（一）是　中國固有買賣藥式的醫生，他們出賣班能補得腎丸，龍虎丹一類的藥，靠銷藥賺錢，主顧大多是鄉下人。他們也打針，不過打的是中國針灸，（二）西藏路一帶的半中半西四間門面的花柳病醫生，佔上海花柳醫之大部分，形容大致如上述，其中也不之有經騐有效力的醫生。（三）確有本領的花柳醫生，他們的主顧大多是大家閨秀，良家婦人，姨太太之流，因為面子有關，不便往外面宣揚。像這幾位醫生，一年有三數個主顧，收入就足够開銷了。此外他們並靠囤積着的西洋春藥。（四）公立醫院的正式花柳科醫生。</p>
<p>如今，一方面衛生局下在辦理醫生登記，不合格的將被取締，另一方面，警察局又在開始禁舞，禁娼，則這些醫師和「博士」的營業將大受影響，或甚至全部被淘汰，那是勢所必然的了。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾夫人　廬山生活</h3>
<p>— 本報一日牯嶺航訉　特派記者謝寶珠</p>
<p>五星上將來到山上以後，無疑的，廬山的政治烟雲就開始彌漫起來了。</p>
<p>記者們在這彌漫的烟霧中，竭力想找出這五顆星的。一閃一動——馬歇爾將軍的生活。</p>
<p>當然，馬歇爾夫人的動態，也是一般人所喜歡知道的。這裏，就記下一些關於馬帥夫人動態的片斷。</p>
<p>如果你要知道馬夫人每日幾點鐘起身的話，這裏就可以吿訴你：她是一個早起者。晨七時半，是她的標準起床時間。在她下床以前，一個必有的節目，就是要喝完一杯淸咖啡。兩枚鹹湯水泡蛋，三片土司，一坏咖啡，幾件水菓，這就是馬夫人的早餐，進早點的時間普通都在九時半。</p>
<p>午餐以後，馬夫人照例是需要午睡的。她的午餐是相當簡單：二塊雞排或牛排，幾色冷菜—紅蘿卜，洋山芋，四季豆—然後一杯西瓜水或其他菓汁，就算完事。馬夫人是不想變成胖太太的。在最多兩小時的午睡後，茶點時間到來，就用一杯可可和很少的餅干。晚飯經常是在七點半吃得比中飯更少。馬夫人在這淸靜幽閒的環境中，雖然應該有充分的時間可以休養身心，但她晚上還是要到十一點左右才安寢。這也許是她關心丈夫，協助丈夫工作的緣故。</p>
<p>馬帥夫婦之間，伉儷情篤，相敬如賓，始終如新婚燕爾時一樣，這早爲一般讀者所熟知。</p>
<p>馬夫人對馬帥的一舉一動，時在念中，照料無微不至。她總感覺到自馬帥來華以後，不時在緊張的空氣中工作，爲著中國和平的實現而奔走，幹著一件非常偉大的事業。因此，她亟欲爲他分担一部分的辛勞，而使馬帥的生活能略爲輕鬆一些。這次上山來時，她特地爲他帶來一套靑灰色的西服給他換上，然後跟他說：「現在，你總可把那套五星上將衣服卸去了，免得整天拘束着自己。」</p>
<p>馬帥呢？也時時刻刻想到夫人在山上無聊寂寞，覺得很是抱歉，所以也特地帶了一付跳棋，給妙解悶，每當稍暇的時候，就陪着夫人下棋，如果她輸了的話，一定非再來一盤不可。</p>
<p>在馬帥離牯時期內，她每天至少要打電話二次到南京去問丈夫的好。尤其當她知道馬帥要上山的那天，她一面早就關照廚子預備丈夫所愛吃的菜，一面不斷地差人向電台探聽上山的時間，然後親自乘轎在山頭上仰首迎候。</p>
<p>除了有時邀請　蔣主席夫婦過去聚餐外，馬夫人來山後還沒正式約過什麽客人宴會。在午飯前或茶點後，常常和　主席夫婦在附近一帶散步，或同去野餐，或和　蔣夫人聊天，賞花，下棋，上街逛逛。有時則一人帶了老媽子去散步，或到街上看看景色，買些小玩意兒。</p>
<p>馬夫人不但是一個賢內助，而且是一位多才多能的作家。她間來時常寫作，閱讀，並幫助丈夫整理文件。</p>
<p>和藹，親切，民主，寬大，都是使許多人對馬夫人表示愛戴敬重的一個原因。凡是替她做過事的人，都會異口同聲地稱頌她待人的好處。她對待上中下三等人，是不分階級，完全一視同仁。如果左右侍從做錯了事，她非但不加以斥責，而且給予規勉安慰。難怪她左右的人都說：「即使一個很壞很壤的人，到她身邊做事，也會變成好人」。你知道她關心屬下的人到什麽程度？要是問起他們早點祗吃兩片土司時，她馬上就把自己吃的早點全數强迫你吃掉，自己則等着廚子再做一份。</p>
<p>對待她身邊的老媽子，馬夫人是格外的愛護，把她當作自己的朋友一般，常常和她談談說說，給她講自己從小到大的一段段故事，甚至把她和馬帥怎樣聯姻，新婚時快活的種種情形都吿訴她。提起這個老媽子，她是一個三十多歲的樸實女子，說一口上海話，還能說比洋涇浜更好些的英語。老媽子羨慕馬夫人得到這末個好丈夫，人家羨慕老媽子有那末個好主人。</p>
<p>我們不能不承認，丈夫的得失成敗，往往受到妻子的影響很大。馬帥的肩上，所以有五顆明星在不時閃現，夫人的功勞是不可抹煞的。</p>
<h3>還都後第一次首都盛大音樂會　馬帥美使等蒞會大為激賞</h3>
<p>— 本報七月廿五日南京航訉　記者濮德玠</p>
<p>七月二十四日晚間，冷落寂寥的國民大會堂門前，驀地又形熱鬧。大汽車小汽車，吉普，三輪車，密密軋軋排滿在寬敞的馬路兩旁，會堂門廳內外，燈火輝煌，仕女如雲。許多衣冠楚楚的紳士淑女，笑着，說着；有的佩了橘紅絹條兒，是主人；有的拿着大雅的請柬，是客人；從八點鐘開始，把這幾個月來轉着這瑰偉宏大的建築的晦氣，冲的無影無踪。</p>
<p>（一）喜氣洋溢</p>
<p>這是還都後南京第一次盛大音樂會，這是勝利後國民大會堂第一次洋溢着喜氣。表演的是高級的大典音樂，邀請的是南京的要人雅士，一切是紳士的浪頭，大家的作風。</p>
<p>會塲里的空氣是　美的，紳士淑女們坐在舒適的彈簧座椅上，很禮貌地和熟人打招呼，女主人們招呼着來賓按號坐下，大家輕輕地談，輕輕地走，輕輕地指點着舞台上簡潔而堂皇的裝飾與陳設。大幅的紫紅絲絨幕從高高的台口垂下來，閃着亮光，上面兩排白紙剪的字「中央宣傳部中央文化運動委員會主辦」「音樂演奏會」，再一排兩個主辦機關底英文名字，正中是耀眼而神秘的淡淡銀紫色的一架豎琴，和兩枝分列兩邊的水仙花，底下是一排「音樂訪問團」底英文名字。台前正中攏着一座黑色大鋼琴，兩把深黃色絨墊椅子，台口上勻稱地陳設着六個滿裝康乃馨和月季的花籃。一句話，是一個美麗的台面，當音樂開始時，人們將忘掉了這大厦外面的任何麻煩。</p>
<p>（二）主任致詞</p>
<p>首席貴賓是馬歇爾元帥，他在八時四十分到達會塲，馬上被主人邀上了樓廳，這時會塲里的座位已滿了大半，黨國底元老和政府底官員大都坐在右手，靑年黨共產黨和民盟底人物多在左手，友邦底使節來了不少，文化界底人士也來了很多，記者羣相當活躍，但是誰都明白，在這個塲合里，還是不提那些難題目好，因爲每個人都在望着舞台，等着聽美妙的音樂。</p>
<p>八時五十分，文運會底張主任委員道藩，代表主人致詞，他很誠擊地謝了地主和演奏者底厚誼，又謝來賓底光臨。他說希望訪問團這次出國，能把中國新音樂底成就顯示給友邦人士和海外僑胞，同時更可以把西洋音樂底技巧帶回來，使中國底音樂美化凈化。最後他又客氣地向大家道歉會堂的冷氣設備尚沒裝好，使大家受熱。但是事實上這是一個非常凉爽宜人的夜晚呢！</p>
<p>（三）音樂開始</p>
<p>八時五十五分堂燈暗了，會堂在一個短時期間是黑漆漆的，同時連輕微的脚步聲和談話聲都沒有了，右手的照明燈先亮，左下方的跟着亮，左邊的也亮了，千萬條視綫集中在台上，馬思宏先生從左邊幕縫中走了出來，白襯衣，白花領結，白西服上衣，墨綠色下裝，白皮鞋，手里拿着精緻的小提琴，年靑光亮的眸子，彬彬的禮貌贏得了鼓掌。跟着出來的是鋼琴伴奏馬思蓀小姐和另一位照料歌譜的小姐，同樣的綠地白花旗袍和白鞋子，音樂開始了，是馬思聰先生的兩支提琴曲，「思鄉曲」是委婉而綿惻的，許多人低下頭閉了眼；「旋轉曲」是愉快的輕捷的，使人想起那著名的「匈牙利舞曲」，在掌聲裏第一個節目束。</p>
<p>（四）高音獨唱</p>
<p>第二個節目是黃源尹先生的男高音獨唱，除了打一朵黑領花外，裝束和馬先生一樣，短短的身材，寬厚的胸膛，一眼看過去就是一個歌手。一連唱了三支，個個博得掌聲。他音色十分美，音域也廣，情緒表現功夫老到，尤其是第三支「托斯卡！咏歎詞（Tosca－Aria）」，令人相信如果這曲的作者蒲契尼（Puccini），那意大利十七世紀的古曲音樂家能復活，來聽他這一曲，也一定會和他握手的。</p>
<p>第三個節目是吳樂懿小姐底鋼琴獨奏。她穿一襲淺玫紅色地大的白和深紫色花的綢旗袍，白鞋子，一露面就引起了掌聲，她微笑着坐在已張開了琴蓋的鋼琴面前，試了幾個音，就開始演奏。十個手指輕巧熟練地跳躍在琴鍵上，彈了三支名曲：是拉克馬尼諾夫（Rachmaninoff）底「G短調序曲（Prelude　in　G　Mlinor）」阿貝尼茲（Alceniz）底「柯渡伐（Cordova）」，和拉柯納（Lecuona）底「瑪勒管納（Malaguena）」，隨着鏗錚的琴聲而起的是熱烈的鼓掌，一個小女孩獻上了一束鮮花，在掌聲裏，吳小姐笑着接受了它，並一再地謝各位來賓。這是九時三十五分鐘，前半節目完畢，休息時間到來。</p>
<p>（五）馬帥趣味</p>
<p>正在這個時候，司徒大使和傅涇波先生來了，他們上了樓，大使和特使握了手以後就坐在左面第二排，馬歇爾特使對音樂很有興趣，每一個節目完畢他都鼓掌稱議，座位從第一排換到第四排，第五排，可始終在右邊。此外樓上還有彼得羅夫大使，邵力子先生夫婦龍雲院長與幾位主人，再有就是些名媛小姐——她們大多拿了紈扇請特使簽字，特使直在愉快的微笑和靜聽。</p>
<p>十分鐘休息時間過去了，節目從新開始，黃源尹先生又唱了三支中國曲：趙元任先生底「敎我如何不想他」，夏之秋先生底「思鄉由」，和黃自先生底遺作「天倫」。這三支情緒顯著的抒情曲，又是大家都懂得的，受到了熱烈的歡迎。尤其是「思鄕曲」，它使許多聽衆低下了頭，在這堂皇與華美的塲裏，挑起了一縷思緒，使多少人想起歸不得的故鄉；不用說，這支歌引起了大鼓掌。第五個節目是鋼琴獨奏，吳小姐以妙嫻熟的技巧先奏出蕭邦（Chopin）底「搖籃曲（Beceuse）」，這位偉大的波蘭音樂家，如同莫札特（Mozart）一般，在他短短的天才煥發的歲月里，吃遍了各種各樣的苦痛，却盡寫出些美麗，愉快的歌篇。這是一個幸福，安謐的曲子，使人感到天使的降臨，沉緬在無音的祥和中，以至在曲終時大家竟忘記了鼓掌。其次她又奏出了法國鋼琴之王理茲德（Liszt）底「弄臣（Rigoletto－Paraphrase）」，在風暴般的掌聲裏她結束了她底節目。</p>
<p>（六）提琴獨奏</p>
<p>第六個節目，也是最後一個節目，又是馬思宏先生的小提琴獨奏。一支修貝特（Shubert）底「聖母頌（Ave　Maria）」，一支克雷斯勒（Kreisler）底「中國花鼓（Tambourin　Chinois）」，這兩歌使琴手充分表現了他底技巧，後者底流利和前者底悠遠恰恰是一個對比，馬先生很輕鬆地分別把它們刻劃了出來，尤其是「聖母頌」後半的雙弦足够利馬思骢先生相比擬。「中國花鼓」是由民歌美化與淨化了的提琴曲，但是祗　了很少成分的中國民間風味，似乎這種從民間藝術擷英複製的工作還得由我們自己來作方對。</p>
<p>十時二十分節目完畢，嘉賓紛紛離去，每個人嘴角上都掛着滿意的微笑。誠然這是一個相當成功的演奏會，幾位年靑的藝術家將有着燦爛無比的前途。</p>
<p>國民大會堂門前的車水馬龍漸漸流散開去了，一切歸於恬靜，但是在今夜，一直有幾個不同情緒的聲音迴旋在我耳邊：「思鄕曲」底婉惻，幽怨，「聖母頌」底虔誠，祈求，「採篮曲」底安謐，幸福……，我眼前顯露出一幅幅的圖畫，從苦難到安樂，希望這是在堂皇歡樂的會塲里一時被忘記的受着折磨的同胞底幸運寫照。</p>
<h3>倫敦點滴</h3>
<p>— 七月廿一日倫敦航訊　本報特約記者雪岩</p>
<p>從今日起，全英國的麵包，不能再自由購買，每人祇能在其所分配到的限量內購買。大約每人每日可得六片，其餘麵粉麵條的分配量，也各有定額，與此相配。據英國一部分報紙說，現在英國的糧食，是白人世界中最苦的了。在戰時可免於分配的麵包，想不到在戰事停止一年後的今日，反要嚴格限制，實在是意外的。因爲這新制度影響到全國的每一個人，所以興趣非常普遍，家家戶戶，引爲談資，報紙更是天天大字標題。反對黨議員，更以此爲黨爭的好題材，遇有機會，即引以證明工黨的無能，總是暗示，你瞧罷，保守黨在戰時都能解決的問題，到了工黨手裏，平時都沒法辦了。保守黨的報紙，自然也推波助瀾，隨時提醒人民，這是政府的弱點。麵包決定實行分配的消息，傳出以後，最着荒的，是烤麵包的麵包師，紛紛組成團體，要求見糧食部長，嚴重抗議，但部長所能做到的，衹有態懃解釋，坦白的指出糧食儲藏量的貧乏，和全世界災荒的普遍，正是所謂巧婦難爲無米之炊，政府決定實行分配制，也是不得已之舉，一旦形勢轉好，自當早日取消。其他另一批人不安的，便是主持中饋的太太小姐們，所謂主婦也者，他們也組織了英國主婦聯盟（British　Housewives’Leagne），常去和糧食部爭鬧。本來英國糧食的貯藏量究竟有多少，始終是個秘密，一部分人猜測，至少够一年之需。但最近因事實逼迫，不得不發表眞相，據說祇有八個星期的存糧了，八個星期以後，將指望何處供給，現在還渺無把握，所以實行分配，實在是必不得之舉。</p>
<p>借款成功</p>
<p>在實行麵包分配制前夕，予人在生活舒展方面一點新希望的，是向美國近四十億美元借款的成功，在衆議院中順利通過，現在已經美總統簽署，成爲正式法案，即日可以動用了。利用這筆款項的步　計劃，政府早有縝密籌算，據　大部分將用於購買機械，零件配備之數，藉以加速生產，其中一小部分，才用於改善生活，糧食及印刷品，紙張之類，居於首位：財政大臣說得好，這筆借款，至是給英國人一個喘息的時間，紙能視爲恢復繁榮的跳板，不能用爲安坐享福的沙發。這裏，我們有一點應該注意，即英國的恢復繁榮問題，是戰後諸強中最上軌道最迅速的國家，決不能以我國國內標準來衡量，即如美國那樣物資豐厚的國家，亦因工潮連綿，工業復員之速，不如英國。根據海外貿易部的報吿，英國的出口貿易，非但已超過預計，且已超過戰前。目前英國的情形，是國內較苦，生產品極力向國外推銷，以爭取戰後還擺動不定的世界市塲。美國這筆借款，更是加速它擴展海外貿易的一部分資產。然而不巧得很，這筆債借到之日，也正是美國物價高漲的時候，據說從談妥借款之日起，到美國衆院核准這日止，美國物價，已約略漲上百分之三十左右，也即是借款的眞正價值，跌落了百分之三十左右。如果將來還債之日，適當物價下跌之時，則英國的無形損失甚大，所以英國政府，不準備在這物價大漲之日，動用這筆借款的大部分，本年度內，擬先用去四分之一，即十億美元左右，其餘等待異日，這筆借款目前雖已到手，但交涉的經過，却也是曲折困難的，美國雖知英國需要帮助，而美國也願意貸款，但美國把這貸款，顯然看爲發展世界商業政策的一部分，針對英國的帝國優先，英鎊集團等壁壘進攻，作爲借款的條件，所以交涉廳時甚久，中間曾有幾度有決絕的危險。英國經濟學界的天才凱恩斯（Kegnes）勳爵，據說就是因交涉這筆借款而積勞致死的。就在與美國行政當局談妥後，在通過立法手續的過程中，也有好幾次有被否決的危險，美政府差不多以全力來支持它的平安通過。所以英國政府雖滿懷指望這筆借款，稍稍蘇解目前的窘迫，但也不完全依賴它。據說英財政部於談妥借款後，即從事準備借款成功或失敗二種互相平行的計劃，後者直到美國衆院核准借款後才放棄的。</p>
<p>開明措置</p>
<p>英國本土雖小，但爲全世界最老牌，最碩大的帝國。殖民地遍及世界，整個非洲，大半是它的所有物。但這帝國之所以能屹立，確也有它的長處，即是常能識時代之趨向，防隱患於未然。譬如這次工黨上台以來，在本國以內，實行社會主義，消溟貧富間的差殊。同時對於殖民地，也自有一套開明措置。例如最近擬允印度獨立，助其組成自主政府，即是一個最顯著的例子。其他如允許撤退在埃及的駐軍，准許外約但獨立等，都是這種開明趨向的表現。雖然，我們也知道英國所給予的獨立，實際上與殖民地的地位，相差無幾，但究竟前進了一步。最近因工黨秉政已滿一年，議會內特舉行一次關於殖民地政策的辯論。道是工黨執政以來的第一次，反對黨和政府黨都很踴躍，除了戰後殖民地兵役復員，戰後建設等一套戰後政策八股外，雙方都注意到殖民地人民的生活改善問題。因爲殖民地生活的艱苦，與歐洲人不能相比，截然成為二個世界，且已到這不能藉其自力發展的程度。這日議會中所述及的改進措置甚多，但在其殖民大臣霍爾（Hall）所發表的演說中，有二件事最值得注意：（一）是去年已經通過的一個名爲殖民地福利改進法案（Colonial　and　WelfareDevelopment　Act），即在十年之間撥款二億一千萬鎊，專用於改良殖民地人民的福利。且規定其中二億三千萬鎊專用於改善高等教育。英國殖民部所轄的人口，約共五千萬（印度不屬殖民部），平均每人得於十年之內，沾光四鎊餘，雖爲數甚微，但到底也聊勝於無，相信這筆錢必能使殖民地人民，得到實惠，必無問題。（二）想把職工同盟的組織，推行到殖民地去。本來殖民地人民生活艱苦的主要原因，是勞力代價低廉，終年辛勤，尚不够飽暖，其勞力的收穫，全爲旁人攘奪而去。所以組織勞工，使其爲自己的生活改善而奮鬥，這本是最基本的辦法。工黨藉此起家，自然不忘起這套法實，現在聽說已派最有經騐的人，到殖民地去開始組織了，希望將來可有成績。其他政治上建設上雖都有新默，但並無多大特色了。</p>
<p>政治宣傳</p>
<p>從政的人，沒有不注意宣傳的。宣傳的力量和實效，究竟怎樣，是很難估計，但宣傳之刺眼，却絕無問題。英國工黨，自執政以後，許多黨內分子，總想利用其現在當權的機會，改善其在國內的宣傳地位。大英廣播公司章程的修改問題，鬧了差不多一年了，至今還沒有最後的結論，據最近英國樞密大臣摩理遜的表示，大致要指派包括各主要黨派的委員會，從事調査公司章程應修改之處，但調查的結果，要待下次章程期滿時再考慮，目前則仍准許原章程延長五年（今年十二月底滿期。）大英廣播公司是政府特許獨家經營的廣播公司，其章程由政府頒給，始於一九二六年，至今已二十年了，公司業務，今昔雖已大有不同，但章程條文，大致依舊。</p>
<p>最近工黨中一部分人士，又注意到報紙問題了，認爲目前報紙的股分，落於少數人之手，有包攬偏頗之嫌，有失輿論公正之本意，政府應該從事調查改善。目前英國報紙，力量最大者，自推泰晤士報，此報標準極高，但銷數並不大，持論也較公正。銷路最廣者爲每日快報（日銷三百七十餘萬分），每日郵報，俱爲保守黨所辦之報紙，但注重社會新聞，在政治上的影響力並不大。左派報紙，有每日前鋒報，爲工黨黨報，每日工人報（Daily　Worker），爲共產黨黨報，新聞記事報，雖爲自由黨報紙，但亦稍偏左。據中立人士的統計，目前左派報紙的總銷數，雖趕不上右派，但兩者總和的相距，並不太大。且即在右派報紙銷路估優勢的時候，選舉結果，未受影響，足見宣傳的效力，並不如想像之大。問題是在敵派報紙施行攻擊時，使當政者感覺不舒服而已。據說以前麥克唐納及邱吉爾任首相的時期，都曾有過同樣的感覺和計劃，但經鄭重考慮後，都未實行。所以工黨當政後，希望仍能保持這個傳統。蓋民主政治的主要條件，是在當政者忍得住批評，且能接受批評。因此這問題現在雖已經工黨一部分議員提出，但恐不能得到政府的支持，難望通過。不過顯示工黨中有許多議員，有這傾向罷了。</p>
<h3>瀋陽三件事　馬糞·垃圾·水電</h3>
<p>— 本報七月廿六日航訊　東北特派員韓淸濤</p>
<p>瀋陽電不足，電車開不出來，汽油缺乏，汽車也很有限，所以盛行了馬車，架子車，三輪車。通衢大馬路上，每天從早到晚「得得」的馬蹄聲，使人不能安靜下來，此外更造成了一個「馬糞遍大街，糞臭隨風起」的現象。</p>
<p>馬糞遍大街</p>
<p>從內地來的記者先生們，時常把這件事報導到各地去，到瀋陽來的人，第一個印象，也是關於馬車和馬糞的事，急壞了市長董文琦，也忙煞了市府衛生人員，有人想出辦法來，責令軍主把每匹馬屁股後，掛一個鐵兜子，可是馬糞照舊多，原因是馬糞不能完全落到兜子裏，落在兜子裏的馬糞，又時常被馬車伕偸偷的倒在了街頭。</p>
<p>一萬一千多架馬車和鐵架子車，在街頭跑，市府七百多個掃街伕，天天在街上掃。不但馬糞的問題，始終不能得到合理的解決，同時和馬蹄以及馬車輪有連帶關係的馬路，有些也變成了「路不平」的現象。</p>
<p>汽車及電車</p>
<p>這件惱人的事體，經過了幾個月的工夫，到了目前，纔稍稍有些眉目，那就是市府修好了汽車六輛，在東關到中長路車站的路上跑，八月內可能把郊外的破碎汽車，蒐集修理好廿五輛至卅輛，乘人就可多了。</p>
<p>瀋陽的電車，共計有六路，全長是卅五公里，共有電車卅餘輛，現已修好十七輛，決定在八月一日，先開出十二輛，所用電力，係由兵工廠供給，那裏可有七八百基羅瓦特的電力送出來，白天開動電車，晚間供給主要街道照明。</p>
<p>這樣來，市內居民，對於行的問題，大部分得到了解決，馬車和大車，要被取締在城區內載客了，市府的計劃，決定叫他們向鄉區發展，如此不但便利了城區和鄉村的交通，同時亦正解決了大部份馬糞問題，在另一方面，則將鼓勵他們去撫順拉運煤觔，以解決冬天的煤荒。</p>
<p>垃圾三萬噸</p>
<p>同着馬糞有同樣令人感覺不舒服的是「垃圾問題」，這件事情，不但破壞了環境衛生，影響到了市民健康，同時更沾污了市容，據衛生局調查垃圾現有一百零九大堆，約有四萬萬立方尺，重量在三萬噸以上。</p>
<p>董市長說：這是他肩頭上的重担子，除了治本的辦法外，他决定從七月廿九日起，舉行瀋市大掃除三天，發動全體市民，參加這個活動，另外商准長官部撥卡車廿輛，開始自人口密集的地方，向外拉運垃圾，逐次擴展淸除工作。</p>
<p>在治本方面，决定修復已被破壞之煤氣工廠，現正在整修機械，預計到九月底，可修復三處，約供給一萬戶居民做炊事之用，如此可减少一部份垃圾之逐漸加多，據聞在淸除垃圾及修復煤氣廠上，善後救濟總署，用「以工代賑」方式，撥發麵粉和欵項等，約計六百九十萬元，解救了市府許多經濟上的困難。</p>
<p>淸水流不出</p>
<p>都市主要的飲料和淸潔上所需用的「水」，也有問題，城區方面，多用普通所謂「洋井」者取水，有些地方則在舊式大井裏汲水，所以問題尚小，所成問題的則在和平區，因為自來水的設備，多成了裝飾品，好多的水管，已經好久流不出水來。</p>
<p>住在樓上的人，得用水桶把水一桶一桶的提到樓上去，抽水馬桶裏的大小便，也要提水沖下去，有好多地方的廁所，弄得臭地薰天，記者住過一個醫院，就有這般情景，一切衛生設備，因為沒有水，都失掉了效用。</p>
<p>瀋陽市的水源地，到了目前，纔得修復完整，不過因為電力不足，衹有北陵，萬泉，砂山，三個水源地，每日供電五六小時，合計供水量不足一萬噸，尙不及以前供水量七分之一，塔灣水源地，近期也可開放，此外幷擬於「鐵西」另建水源地一處，以增水量，幷擬和長春鐵路局商談，將其所轄各水源地撥歸瀋陽市使用，以俟電力充足的時候，大家就可有「如魚得水」的享受了。</p>
<p>電力總關鍵</p>
<p>水，糞，垃圾，都在直接或間接的需要電，電關係着整個瀋陽市的恢復健康，以及將來的發展和繁榮，撫順和瀋陽部份的火力電機，僅能解決小部份的供給量，市府現打算到日本買三百馬力以上的電動機數台，以資救急。</p>
<p>瀋陽的電源，鴨綠江方面，沒有希望輸送過來，吉林「小豐滿」的電廠，雖然在國軍手裏，但在輸送綫路的中途，經過一小部份共軍的區域，像梅河口以北—從朝陽鎭至磐石之綫路，以及梅河口以南—山城鎭至淸源等地，都是這樣的情形，據長官部電源搶修隊長王玉信說：梅河口以南，線路鐵塔多遭共軍破壞，同時他還親眼看見他們做有計劃的破壞行動，小豐滿電源無法南送，造成了四平街以北電源過剩的現象</p>
<p>林彪代表李立三到瀋陽時，記者們間到他從「小豐滿」輸電至藩陽的事情，他說：「是一個小問題」，不過大家都殷切希望這個小問題能早日解決，以使工廠復生，人民得到好的生活。</p>
<h3>廬山小新聞</h3>
<p>— 本報牯嶺航訊　特派記者謝寶珠</p>
<p>馬歇爾元帥第二次　上山之日，蔣主席夫婦特親自上街購買一寸餘長綠色磁鴨兩隻贈送馬帥夫婦淸玩。此鴨小巧玲瓏，馬帥夫婦得之高興異常，聞兩鴨共價三千元。</p>
<p>二十八日晚　主席略感不適，稍有寒熱，但次日仍抱病出席主持夏令營紀念週及江西暑期學術講習會開學典禮。返邸後遵醫囑仍需休息，是日夫人隨時侍喚，整日未出門，連花園亦未踏進。</p>
<p>各報記者在廬，除整日爲採訪新聞而緊張外，並對攝影發生極大興趣。有自備相機者，有借用者，一等冲洗後成績表現，咸爭相參觀高呼「好極，好極，」或「可惜，可惜。」</p>
<p>胡金芳旅社內住了一位洋人，不　華語，每次吃飯前必埋頭，苦翻其英華語對照小字典，可是摸索半天，還是叫不出他要吃的東西，就是叫出來了，江西茶房也依舊莫明其妙，而肚子郤已餓得差不多了，不得已，茶房祗能請敎記者們當臨時譯員。幸虧此君候船，不日即下山，轉潯赴滬，否則天天大傷腦筋，眞有辜負上山休養的意味了。</p>
<p>此間警察頗具「悠哉遊哉」之風，蓋街上行人不多，打架情事絕少，旣無洋車照會可撬，又無癱販可趕，祇是在有要人的上山時站崗起來作的姿勢立正。</p>
<p>梁寒操詩興頗濃，登山日即向友人背詩一首，乃九年前舊作。詩云：「又溯長江探五老，依然多難作登臨，沉舟東海當年恨，擊楫中流此際深。綠樹沿江成鬱勃，浮雲遮日幻晴陰，風雷且待明朝起，不耐長嘆萬馬瘄。」（卅日）</p>

<h3>為救濟難胞進一解</h3>
<p>— 誠正</p>
<p>邇來政府當局，社會賢達，對於蘇北流亡難胞，奔走呼籲，施款賑糧，極盡救濟能事，受惠者自應歌功頌德，銜感無涯，爲什麽仍復怨聲載道，甚且有時日曷喪之咒詛？</p>
<p>余乃一究其實際情形，蓋流亡難胞中，或個人逃亡，或盡室以行，衣食住所，在在困難，救濟者雖盡九牛二虎之力，身受者仍有杯水車薪之感，且蘇北近半年來，暴民專政，倡言翻身，藉口淸算，挑動鬥爭，人民生命財產，亳無保障，言論集會，全失自由，其淪陷未獲逃出之父老兄弟諸姑姊妹，聞有以細故而身　囹圄者，有無辜而加反動頭銜者，藉結算十年念年無根之老賬，以破其人之家者，號召佃農倒租退榖，以冲沒地主產權，如仍有不够，則拆分其房屋，搬走其傢具，務使地主家產蕩盡而後快者，在民國二十九年前充任鄕鎭保甲長之人員，拘押刑罰，無一倖免，中農富農，中商富商，以及知識靑年，地方先進，非其黨羽者，百計陷害，一網打盡，而於靑年婦女，號召參加婦聯，强迫慰勞士兵，其不甘受辱失節致身死非命者，日有所聞，他如戴高帽，披狗皮，駝龜壳，拖尾把，舐屁股，綑綁沿等之慘劇，花樣層出不窮，事件成千累萬，凡此種種，聞者酸鼻，見者傷心，黃巢之亂，闖獻之暴，無斯慘也，救濟團體，對於難胞衣食住問題完全解決，固力有不逮，即曰能之，而於其有家歸不得，曁其妻離子散與天仍在家鄕度其泥犂地獄生活者之內心痛苦，仍不能减其亳厘，則其怨其詛，以及前此下關之毆案，義憤所激，似亦情有可原，而難怪其然！</p>
<p>政府停戰再停戰，議和復議和，徒耗時日，收效有幾，而流亡難胞，已急煞氣煞。且大軍久頓，給養維艱，進進退退，尤足沮喪士氣。今蘇北共軍，叛國進攻泰泰靖如，已受挫折，周恩來氏又將奔走言和，重彈舊調，政府如以保民養民爲責任，應執行國家綱紀，責令久經撒消番號之叛軍，—新四軍退出蘇北，移駐指定地區，改革暴民專政作風，靜候政府整編，俾政令軍令統一，內亂消除，共同建國，否則彼新四軍擾亂地方，殘民以逞，叛跡昭著，政府應即聲罪勘亂，毋使滋蔓，此則軍令軍紀攸關，而非政黨政策之爭矣。</p>
<h3>軍車傷人逸去</h3>
<p>敝人今日上午八時半由北四川路寓所僱人力車到外攤央行辦公，路經東寶興路，突被由後而來之軍車撞倒。當時人與車夫均遭暈厥，經路人扶起，軍車早已飛馳而去。後經檢視敝人衣服全被扯毀，約值念萬元，皮肉受傷頗重。車夫同受重傷，人力車全毀。駕車司機喪盡天良公德，闖禍而逃。敝人受傷，並損失衣服當係小事，車夫受傷，並欲償車行損失，其慘可知。査近來市區人口衆多，交通秩序日見紊亂，肇禍之事日必數起，倘當局不加重視而挽救以後情形必不堪設想矣。（俞公約）</p>
<h3>朽腐變神奇辨</h3>
<p>閱貴欄所刊「化朽腐爲神奇」一文後，竊有管見奉吿。吾人不能徒知垃圾中多有用之物而嘆爲暴殄天物，須知欲加整理而使「朽腐」變爲「神奇」，結果恐得不償失。</p>
<p>試以兩千噸垃圾集中一處，其所需運輸費用必極可觀，再倘以人力整理揀選，每人每日最多半噸，兩千噸即需四千人，每人每日給以工資兩千元（似太非薄），則一日須耗八百萬元，而其他打包運輸之費尚不在內，以百分之五十爲煤灰塵埃，百分之二十為瓜皮果殼之垃圾，而欲仗之每日「出產」數百萬元，恐非易事。况上海的垃圾在桶中時已被小乞精選一二次，稍能變錢之物，俱已分別化爲「神奇，」焉待集中後始被發現。</p>
<p>際此物價騰貴，物力維艱之年，垃圾中「神奇」之物恐不多見，且一旦實施大規模之揀選工作時，除非遠離滬市十公里，否則必致臭氣薰蒸，蠅蚋叢生。DDT雖能殺虫，但恐開支愈大矣。（王兆培）</p>

<h3>復興廣東蠶絲業</h3>
<p>— 何志端</p>
<p>一　緒論</p>
<p>農業爲本省經濟之主要基石，農業投資中，以蠶絲業之資本回轉爲最速：每單位重量之農產品價格中，以同單位重量之生絲價格爲最高，在蠶絲業最盛時期，人民賴以爲生者，三百餘萬佔本省人口十分之一强。本省輸出特產雖多，然其經濟總值，猶未及生絲輸出額最高時期之收入，大部入超漏巵，賴生絲輸出以彌補，綜計民元年至二十一年，本省輸出生絲，共一百零五萬二千包，平均每年約五萬零七十包，每包凈重八十斤，民十一年佔六萬六千九百餘包，佔最高紀錄；民二十年佔三萬四千三百二十餘包，為最低紀錄。民廿二年至抗戰開始期間，每年輸出僅約二萬包，且價格大降，每况愈下！主要蠶區陷敵後，日敵盡其統制掠奪之暴行，復在順德設「東亞平面繭公司」，及平面繭廠，幷强制蠶農，製平面繭，其成品由該公司統制收購，供軍需品製造。當地蠶農絲廠，多改本業，從事於種蔗製糖。本省蠶絲業，日益不振，「順德爲廣東之銀行」已成歷史之陳言矣！</p>
<p>二　復興基金之籌措</p>
<p>一，公辦蠶絲業機構之經費來源：</p>
<p>甲、農林當局本身方面，農林各部門，均具重要性，惟對於國計民生之利益，自有程度之差別，因此農林建設工作之實行，亦宜分別緩急，較次要農林部門之設施經費，自可節減至最小限，以適應較重要農林部門設施經費最大限之需要。蠶絲業爲本省之重要農林部鬥，建設上所預算之經費，亦應較多，否則農林建設，千頭萬緒，百端並舉，反易致徒有皮毛，難補實際。</p>
<p>乙、中央當局方面：現在農林部及經濟部有中國蠶絲公司之設立，具見當局復興蠶絲業之决心。惟該公司工作重點。似在華中一帶，對本省恐或鞭長莫及，故似有另行撥欵補助本省蠶絲業發展之必要。</p>
<p>丙、教濟總署廣東分署方面：凌署長道揚爲農業專家，在署內負重責之廖崇眞先生，爲本省前蠶絲局長，對於本省蠶絲業，待救孔急之情狀，自不言而喻！惟須商酌者，關於救濟蠶絲業欵項，以交由農林當局，統籌運用，較能節省人力財力，提高工作效率，免駢枝重複之弊。</p>
<p>丁、逆產管理局方面：敵偽逆產，散佈本省各地者甚多，實爲龐大財源，對此，當局必已具統籌利用之成策，取之於奸僞，用之於復員建國，頗爲恰當，未審賢達以爲如何？</p>
<p>二，民營蠶絲企業之資本來源：</p>
<p>甲、外商投資，外國因工資過高，蠶業發展不易，例如美國爲生絲銷費國家，其地理在氣候上，頗可栽桑育蠶，惟爲高值之工資所限，勢難發展，彼邦人士之倡導蠶絲業者雖繁，且有提出賤值勞工可由墨西哥方面獲得之解决辦法，然究不若移轉其資本，投於蠶絲業已略具基礎，且有大量低值勞工之本省發展較易。</p>
<p>乙、華僑投資　本省繁榮有賴僑匯者甚多，惟近來僑胞受外地之嚴格匯款限制，故大量資金之匯回國內，尚能待於我外交當局之努力。</p>
<p>丙、廣東實業公司之投資戰時廣東企業公司之投資地域，僅限於粵北一隅，所投資之企業種類，農塲爲類頗多，當時限於環境，對蠶絲業經營，未能顧及，茲國土重光，今後本省輸出，當以蠶絲佔大宗，故投資於蠶絲業，至爲有利，倘以資本短紬，未能創辦較大規模之蠶絲企業，則可設法發行公司股票，以爲資金籌集之法。</p>
<p>丁、銀行投資　抗戰期間，廣東銀行投資於農林業，如耕牛繁殖塲及林塲等，散處粤北各地者甚多，今後相信具有遠見之銀行家，當必競相投資於資金回轉速之蠶絲業。</p>
<p>戊、鼓勵都市遊離資金之投資，城市資金，若任其遊離則易變形爲影響民生之囤積資本，蠶絲業爲永久企業，一業舉而農工商各業隨之具興，遊離資金，不論若何龐大，若善爲鼓勵，可俱收並蓄於此企業中。</p>
<p>己，農民銀行貸款　在本省原有蠶區及擴展蠶區之交通便利市鎭，廣設農民銀行分行，以貸款於蠶農，惟貸借手續及辦事法規，必簡必明，並防私人之投機舞弊，待濟蠶農，多屬貧苦，智識拙劣故於事前須配合農林指導人員，普遍宣傳，使家喻戶曉，妥爲設法，始能惠及貧苦蠶農，否則此種貸款，每易爲地主土豪所利用，於貧農無所裨益。</p>
<p>復興蠶絲業，固須有龐大財力，尤要者，爲財力之運用問題，換言之，爲如何以最小資金，收最大效果以達經濟最良之問題，愚意以為有三點運用原則：（一）集中運用，分兩點言之；一，機構集中，凡應用於復興蠶絲之財力，須集中於少數機構內，統籌分配；二、部門集中，農林建設部門甚廣，財力有限，與其將財力無分軒輊分配於各部門之建設，不如專注於較重要之數部門，先謀復興發展。（二）迅速運用，目前物價飛漲，有增無已，籥得資金後，須即運用，以减少物價之影響；（三）物力運用，吾人於蠶絲塲所之建築物，可利用鄉村之祠堂廟宇；各種冷藏庫，可利用風穴山洞；製絲機械之原動力，可利用東江北江之急流水力；試騐研究之機械儀器圖書，可從最近日本對我損失賠償中設法獲取。</p>
<p>三　增設蠶絲場所</p>
<p>溯戰時負責改進本省蠶絲業者，僅有農林局之蠶絲課，外設塲所有三：（一）樂昌蠶桑改良塲，（二）西江蠶桑改良塲，（三）天蠶試騐塲。光復後至現在除原有塲所外，首要增設塲所爲苗圃及蠶種塲，此兩類塲所，因應蠶業之地理分佈，而酌量設置，負繁殖推廣之任務。</p>
<p>（一）苗圃，戰時各區桑農，改種什糧甘蔗，目前較敏感先覺之農民，已知着手於恢復蠶桑故業，惟多苦於桑苗缺乏，故欲恢復及擴張桑田面積，必先大量育苗，本省桑苗有鶴山種及大同種，後者性不耐旱，宜低濕地，前者性耐旱宜高地旱作，爲迅赴事功計，不妨權宜選擇較少變異之種苗，大量繁殖，至於其他良種，如市平早生九紋龍十文字，鼠返等桑，俟次一步土宜適性試騐後，始可繁殖推廣。</p>
<p>（二）製種塲，目前因桑田面積减少桑葉缺乏頗難大舉育蠶，惟可擇桑量較豐地帶，設塲製成良種，大量推廣，本省蠶種多化性，耐高溫多濕，生育期短，絲質光澤特强，品系不純，質弱多病，繭薄而小，浮絲較多，繅解較難，太省蠶種爲輪月大造，每張蠶種紙（五〇〇蛾），約得鮮繭一五〇—二〇〇斤，江浙每張蠶種紙（二八蛾），可得鮮繭三十斤，本省蠶種之繭產量，不及江浙之半數，故本省亟需產量豐絲質良無毒統一之蠶種，前蠶絲局有碧交種之推廣，西江蠶桑改良塲有二五八種塲設於順德容奇，第二蠶種塲設於南海九江，今已破壞甚大，西江蠶桑改良塲，有僅存之冷藏庫設備。（未完）</p>
<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>三·各方面良好的友誼：對於往來的行家，應該有極密切的聯絡，那末當他們有什麽消息或相巧的原料的時候，就會來通知，有許多人以為購買別人的貨品是佔居上峯地位的，一定要使人得不到利益，或得到極微細的利益，方才稱心。其實他們因此損壊了彼此的友誼，等到有重要的消息或相巧的貨品的時候，別去不會吿訴他們，因此很容易失人良好的機會。</p>
<p>四，準確的記錄：關於各種需要的原料，牠們的來源所需要的數量等，都要有準確的記錄，憑着這些記錄，就可以有很實用的參考，尤其是對於原料的需要量，應該有統計，可以知道每年的消耗量，同時市價的上落，也要有正確的記錄，使他可以參考以往，展望未來。</p>
<p>在進行購料的工作的時候，應該由幾方面開列價格，送閱樣品，中國有句話，叫做「貨比三家不吃虧」，意思就是貨價要經過比較。通常情形是訊問價格，其有保守秘密的必要時，那末應該用投標的方法，由有意供給的幾家商行，估價以後，嚴密封好，送到公司，定一個日期，當衆拆開（稱爲開標）誰開得價廉，就由誰承辦或供應所需的原料（稱爲得標）。</p>

<h3>國畫的臨摹與創作</h3>
<p>— 應野苹</p>
<p>從石濤論畫說起</p>
<p>「不學古法，不成我法，不變古法，終非我法，此之謂石濤家法。」這是我數年前題石濤畫册的幾句跋語，現在拿來作本文的開端，也可說是畫家成功的關鍵。</p>
<p>石濤是歷代中國畫家中最富創作精神的一個畫家，在他的畫諭中可以舉出數點代表他的思想。他在畫語錄變化章第三，這樣說：「至人無法，非無法也，無法而法，乃爲至法。……動則曰某家皴點可以立脚，非似某家山水不能傳久，某家淸澹可以立品，非似某家工巧不足娛人，是我爲某家役，非某家爲我用也。縱逼似某家，亦食某家殘羹矣。於我何有哉？」又在畫語錄絪縕章第七，這樣說：「……畫於山則靈之，畫於水則動之，畫於林則生之，畫於人則逸之。得筆墨之會，解絪縕之分，作闢混沌乎，傳諸古今，自成一家，是皆智得之也。不可雕　，不可板腐，不可沈泥，不可牽連，不可脫節，不可無理。在於墨海中立定精神，筆鋒下決出生活，尺幅上換去毛骨，混沌裏放出光明。縱使筆不筆，墨不墨，畫不畫，自有我在。」又在畫語錄山川章第八，這樣說：「測山川之形勢，度地土之廣遠，審峯嶂之疎密，識烟雲之蒙眛，正踞千里，邪睨萬重，統歸於天之權地之衡也。天有是權，能變山川之精靈，地有是衡，能運山川之氣脈，我有是一畫，能貫山川之形神，此余五十年來未脫胎於山川也，亦非糟粕其山川，而使山川自私也，山川使余代山川而言也。山川脫胎於余耶？余脫胎於山川耶？搜盡奇峯打草稿也，山川與余神遇而跡化也。所以終歸於大滌也。」又在畫語錄尊受章第四，道樣說：「夫一畫含萬物於中，畫受墨，墨受筆，筆受腕，腕受心，如天之造生，地之造成，此其所以受也。「又在石濤的畫題裏有這樣的話：「此道見地透脫，則須放筆直掃，千巒萬壑，縱目一覽，望之若驚電奔雲，屯屯自起，荆關耶？董巨耶？倪黃耶？沈趙耶？誰與安名。余嘗見諸名家，動輒日倣某家？法某派？書與畫天生，自有一人執掌一代之事。」</p>
<p>上面這些論調，可以看出石濤是如何充滿着獨造的精神。摹倣追隨是石濤最排斥的。他是絕頂聰明的人，所以他誇張着自己的創作理論，而遮掩了模倣的事實。他不承認他的畫從某處倣來，他的筆法從某處學來。惟其這樣，才顯出他的天才和創造能力。其實石濤並不是天生的畫家，他的成就，何常不是古人處學來的，我們研究他的畫，應當把他的來歷弄明白，不能看他的理論，不經過理智的分析和事實的根據，就受他的欺騙和矇蔽。何况在他的理論中，也不是絕對的不接受古人的遺法。現在讓我先把他的來歷找出來。不能瞎說，還要舉出證據來。這樣，才不是盲從，才能爲學畫者找出眞的出路。他的畫是學黃鶴山樵的，（即王叔明）他的筆法，是筆筆從山樵得來的。</p>
<p>前年冬天，我在王季遷家裏見到黃鶴山樵的林麓幽居圖，　法有牛毛豆瓣，點苔有遊苔劈面，凡是石濤自詡創作，以爲獨得天地造化之秘的，都在這張畫裏找到。還有山樵的惠麓小隱圖及煎茶圖的筆法，石濤模仿的地方也不少，這樣說來，畫家要不經過臨摹的階段，是不能成功的，石濤就是最能模仿古人的畫家。</p>
<p>譬如做一個電燈泡，最初發明的五支光燈泡，怎樣構造的原理還不懂，要想改進做一百支光電燈泡，是事實上所不可能的。所以要改進，先要明瞭過去成功的原理，然後有更大的成功。畫的模仿，也同樣的要徹底明瞭古人精神命脈之所在，不是看看珂　版，臨些贗本，得其形似，就算了事的，再打一個粗淺的譬喻：</p>
<p>一口泥封的酒罐，貼着紅紙黑字的標籤，大書特書曰「遠年花雕」，下面又是一大套形容色香味的廣吿，及至打開酒樓，却是一泓淸水，叫　涎欲滴的酒徒，只好對着標籲出神，這樣大家能承認他是一　美酒嗎？</p>
<p>所以臨摹不是容易的事，創作更是難極了。王麓臺對於臨摹有這樣的說法，「文沈唐仇以及董文敏，雖用筆各殊，皆刻意師古，實同鼻孔出氣，邇來畫道　僭，古法漸湮，人多自出新意，謬種流傳，遂至邪詭，不可挽救。」麓臺所舉出的文徵明，沈石田，唐六如，仇十洲，以及董其昌，都是代表時代的大作家，我們能够說他沒有創作能力嗎？然而他們的創作，都是從臨古蛻變出來的，所以古人說：「學不師古，似夜行無火。」這話是不差的。</p>
<p>我的結論臨摹乃學習之基礎，創作是成功的表現。臨摹是接受古人用筆，用墨，設色，構圖……的方法，不是抄襲古人的章法。這接受是要經過作者的意識經騐而接受的，我想這一種的「臨摹」，是不會造成湮沒個性而爲古人所囿的結果的吧。</p>
<h3>論近百年來的歐洲繪畫</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>歐洲有獨立的繪畫，是始於十三世紀初頭意大利的喬多（Giotto），一般地說，他是文藝復興先導的畫家。</p>
<p>到最近爲止，歐洲繪畫的歷史，僅僅只有五百多年的時間，他們的發達情形，要與我們中國繪畫來比，自然躍進的程度，遠勝於我們的。</p>
<p>歐洲繪畫爲什麼如此發達，尤其是近百年來的情形，眞是飛黃騰達，我們看了，不勝艷羨，往往自愧不如，或者會怪作家的不努力，這其實是多餘的事。</p>
<p>繪畫的發達，決不是繪畫與其作者自身的事，應該要承認它是一個社會的事。我們拿近百年的歐洲繪畫的發展情形來看，更其可以相信這種看法是合理的，決不是因爲繪畫與政治或宗敎之類絕緣之後的結果，根本應該承認政治或宗敎與藝術的關係是有其必然性的。</p>
<p>一七六四年英國的工業革命，是改變歐洲社會生產方法的開端，在這樣的生產方法之下，形成了新的生產力與生產關係，在繪畫上，古典主義，僅是封建政治的迴光返照，終於敵不過資產階級革命的高潮，大衛（David）便隨着拿破侖政權而歸於消滅，所謂學院派，也不過是古典主義的餘波，被人唾棄是當然的事。</p>
<p>描着「一八三〇年」，「但丁的小船」等大作的特拉克亞（Delacroix），是充滿革命的熱情的畫家，因之，他便享着浪漫主義大師的盛名，他的成就，是反映了法蘭西大革命的成功。</p>
<p>米勒（Millet）與珂爾培（Courbet）是被稱爲現實主義的畫家，他們，一方面想躲避現實，一方面又要暴露現實，這是資產階級社會中藝術家的必然苦悶。這時代，還產生了許多風景畫家，很多人在歌頌他們，因爲他們是把繪畫純粹化了，其實這是錯誤的看法。</p>
<p>成熟期資本主義社會是必然會使科學高度發達的，印象主義新印象主義的繪畫，謳歌日光，重視色彩，不能看作畫家的爲藝術而藝術，它是反映科學發達的藝術。</p>
<p>第一次歐洲大戰前後到第二次世界大戰，資本主義得到高度的發展，充分表現自由競爭，出奇制勝的社會特徵，於是後期印象主義，野獸主義，立體主義，未來主義，超現實主義……五花八門的繪畫又產生了，大家認作純粹繪畫的發達，因爲，這些藝術，不講內容，只求表現。我們中國人，還大聲疾呼地喊着「東方藝術的光榮！」因爲，歐洲畫家也在那兒講究綫條，研究筆法，明明是在學東方藝術，尤其是學中國畫。其實，閉起眼睛來想一想，中國畫是產生於農業生產的封建社會之中，二十世紀的歐洲社會，並不等於中國社會，作爲社會上層建築的繪畫藝術，怎樣會一樣，表面上是光榮，本質上是怎樣呢？</p>
<p>當前是原子時代了，歐洲的繪畫，必然會有一種新的發展的。</p>

<h3>兩個現代彫刻家　彫刻室隨筆</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>現代彫刻的革命先驅者羅丹（A．Rodin　1840－1917）與繪畫界的塞尚（Paul　Cezanne　1839－1906）可稱之爲現代藝術革命家大的兩個功臣。並且他給彫刻建立了「純粹的鑑賞的藝術」的獨立地位。</p>
<p>羅丹生於巴黎，意志極强，富熱情，其作受印象主義影響甚大，特具寫實風格。善於捉摸人們剎那間的感情與動態。故作品極其生動。「接吻」，「思想者」，「卡來之市民」，巴爾札克」，「黃銅時代」都是他平生之代表佳作。</p>
<p>裸女彫刻家馬育</p>
<p>馬育（A．Mailol　1861）雖爲羅丹的後輩，但，他在現代法蘭西藝壇的地位與成就却並不弱於羅丹。不愧被譽為現代彫刻的巨匠。他現在還活着，作品具古典的良好傳統，凡希臘，埃及乃至東方藝術的美的優點與情緒，都被他提煉出來，再以新的技巧新的姿態表現在自己的作品上，如“Harmonie”，“Statuetteen　Bois”“Pomone”，等作都是足以代表的精心傑構，馬氏少時曾追隨過印象派裸女畫家雷諾阿（Auguste　Renoir　1841－1919），受其影響甚大，所作繪畫素描畢肖雷氏作風。曾於一九〇九年時爲雷氏塑造一個肖像，雷氏大爲讚賞，拍案大呼道：「這簡直是我的自畫像呀！」由此可以證明馬雷二氏之作風了。他們兩個，一畫一彫，均爲現代裸女作，可稱爲雙傑。</p>

<h3>山水畫的布置法　（續自七月廿九日稿）</h3>
<p>— 承名世</p>
<p>除了「人字排列法」以外，還有縱橫，虛實的道理：何謂縱橫？就是直的布景，與橫的布景相間。原來一幅畫裏，應該有聳直的處所，同時也應該有橫列的處所，才能顯出有變化，有層次。譬如樹是聳直的，下面的坡石便應橫舖；主峯是聳直的，遠處的山巒便應橫列。又一幅畫裏的主要部份是聳直的，配襯的部份便應橫列；主要部份是橫陳的，配襯的部份便應直聳。古畫的布景，所以易見深遠，便是應用這個道理。</p>
<p>何謂虛實？實是有筆墨的部份，虛是空白的部份。一張畫裏必須有虛有實，或實多虛少，或虛多實少，應隨地斟酌，務期穩妥。近人論畫，以爲與其實多虛少，毋寧虛多實少，這話也不盡然。古畫往往千山萬樹，塡塞滿紙，然而並不見得就不空靈；而近人的畫，雖然一丘一壑，滿紙空白，有時反覺實結；這是古人布置得宜，近人不善章法的緣故。譬如祟山峻嶺之中，在最適宜的處所，露出一段雲烟的空白，便覺得無限空靈，滿紙空白，轉無虛靈之趣了。昔賢說：「古人位置緊而筆墨鬆，今人位置懈而筆墨結」，這兩句話，也很有道理。</p>
<p>山水畫以樹石爲主（石，包括山），一幅畫裏必有主樹主山：就全幅說，幾叢樹裏，必有一叢主樹；（往往是較近的一叢），幾重山裏，必有一重主山；就一層說，幾株樹裏，必有一株主樹；（往往是最前面的一株），幾座山裏必有一座主山。主樹主山，描寫應該特別着力，主樹主山一好，全幅便得勢了。（主樹主山應在比較當中的處所，不可太偏於一面。）</p>
<p>有樹有山是山水畫的正格，有樹無山，或有山無樹，是山水畫的變格。變格祗可偶一爲之，多作了便乏意趣。變格的布景，宜於奇特，使人看了不嫌單調，最要緊的是在變化一點。</p>
<p>統一，均勻，變化三原則，雖然畫中無處不要應用，但在布局方而，尤應特別注意。一幅畫裏所以要有主樹主山，便是應用統一的原則用主樹主山統領聯絡一切，使觀者的注意力集中起來。一幅畫的布局不可太偏重一面，須要各處勻稱，便是應用均勻的原則。組一幅畫的布局，又不可各處太勻稱，須要或偏左，或偏右，或偏上，或偏下，疎處見密，密處見疎，一起一伏，一實一虛，這便是應用變化的原則。而全幅之中，各處須相呼應，不可使氣脈間斷，這也是最要緊的一點。（這也就是統一的原則。）</p>
<p>普通的山水畫，上下須留「天地頭」（天地頭便是上下的空白處），大致「天地頭」約當錢畫的四五分之一，不宜過多過少；「地頭」約當「天頭」的三分之一，不過並不固定，是應隨處斟酌的。有的畫不露「天頭」或不露「地頭」，也有「天地頭」都不露的，這也是一種變格。大致高遠的畫，往往不露「天頭」，以見其高；深遠的畫，往往不露「地頭」，以見其深，（有的在上面露出一段雲氣，有的在下面露出一段雲氣，更見深邃）；至於平遠的畫，則多留「天地頭」，以見平曠。所以平遠的布局，是山水畫中的一稱最普通的章法。</p>
<h3>梅景書屋　讀三王畫</h3>
<p>— 金啓靜</p>
<p>在　暑長夏的傍晚，到嵩山路去訪梅景書屋生人。嵩山路那邊有兩位當代第一流畫家的畫室，一是嵩山草堂，一便是梅景醫廬。</p>
<p>梅景畫屋主人，富於收藏，他擁着歷代的名畫有數百件之多，精於鑒別，所以一般收藏古畫的人們，都要讀他題識鑒別。他有天下第一名作，元人黃子久富春山圖，雖然燼餘一角，而偉績流傳，值得稱爲國賓無雙。</p>
<p>主人藏有四張三尺大小一律的四王山水，這四張山水，年代雖然不同，而紙本整潔無暇，却一點沒有分別，其中石谷麓台兩幅，掛在主人的床舖邊壁上，眞所謂「臥遊」山水了！石谷是墨色，仿着黃鶴山樵的筆法，可是流利輕鬆，和石谷其他的作風不同，尤其是　法絹秀，簡直和南田山水分不出來！有人說：南田和石谷友善，南田不甘第二席，改學花卉以避石谷，但是南田山水，別饒幽逸絹秀的風格，未必一定「第二席」吧！這張石谷山水，畫得非常充實，可是充實之山帶有空虛。一般畫家，只想草草數筆，以空虛自負，如果看過這張石谷山水，不免有新的發現了。</p>
<p>麓台本來長於淺　，這地是用雲林　撓，而寫一峯筆法的淺絳山水，麓台曾經批評過石谷山水「太熟」，並且自　「不生不熟」的，在這幅淺絳山水，便可以證明他的話沒有太誇張。筆力遒勁，似乎也比右邊的石谷山水不同。至於刷色更是到家，梅景書屋主人和我帶笑地指着說：麓台的用色，實在有說不出的微妙呵！</p>
<p>看過石谷麓台之後，便展着烟客的山水，墨色，也是用雲林的意境，而用筆也不是純粹的雲林，上端題着　香光的跋，書屋主人曾經老據這張烟客是四十一歲的壯年作品，香光那時已是近八老翁了，跋語多恭維獎掖的話，這地，書屋主人的意見和我完全一樣，他說：烟客明明是明朝畫家，而史家爲了凑「四王」的名，硬把他拉做淸朝畫家！彷彿現代的蕭屋老，也是八十以外的老前輩畫家，享大名已五六十年了！將來史家，當他淸朝畫家呢？還是民國畫家呢？</p>
<p>最後，我還要看廉州的畫，可是那位書屋主人說；不知藏在何處，一時找不着了！可知梅景畫屋收藏的名畫實在太多了。我也只好讀三王，而凑不成四王。</p>

<h3>上海小姐</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>上海小姐的選舉事，頓挫甚多，影星組中曾說有白楊，周璇，胡楓，秦怡等參加，現在白楊滯平拍片不擬來滬，周璇日前已拒絕參加，胡楓亦正式否認，秦怡是否應允尚不可知，眞令人爲之焦灼，爲這盛舉而悶損。</p>
<p>畢竟也還有令人興奮的事，據說有一位民立女中的學生高淸漪，自動前往蘇北難民救濟協會籌募會報名，參加應選。高女士說她此次參加選舉，係本乎人類互助精神，和救災恤鄰之古訓，其動機全爲救災，並不希望當選。這一風度，十七歲的一個高中學生，豈不值得敬佩？而蘇北三百五十萬流亡同胞更將馨香祝福這一位率先爲侶的具仁俠精神的高女士。</p>
<p>對於選舉上海小姐這回事，我希望無論主持其事者，或其他方而，都不可存有一種玩玩的念頭，大家態度應嚴肅認眞，老實說，主持者如果當作「噱頭」，隨隨便便不將它當作一件極正經的事辦，那麼旁觀者中的空氣一定也輕浮佻橽，參加者自然怕招物談，不願拋頭露面了。今日社會的壞風氣中，「對任何一件事都從壞處看」是最流行的了，沒有信心，不信任人，不與人爲善，實在是我們這個國家的致命傷，我們要糾止這種現象，就得凡事認眞，做一件事像一件事，態度嚴肅，一切公開淸白。</p>
<p>上海小姐的選舉，影星組中這幾位縮身，我不知道是什麽原因，但我相信一定與上述情形有關。其實這個年頭，確需要有勇氣做傻子的人，假使我們存心爲了救濟蘇北難民，還有什麼值得顧忌的呢？別太把自己的身份看得太重，社會並非瞎眼者，評價某人某人是很公平的。因之，爲這一義舉着想，影星組這幾位小姐未能參加，實屬遺憾！而高淸漪女士就更值得我們擁戴的了。</p>
<h3>談怪胎</h3>
<p>— 忠祈</p>
<p>中國人素來認爲生　生兒是吉利的事，是富貴的象徵。如果一胎生三兒或四兒的話，那末，更會當做大大的喜事，而把它當做新聞一樣的傳佈開去。反過來說，如果生了一個怪胎，不消說得，都認爲這是不祥之兆，家屬或族人必定加以活埋溺斃等種種殘忍的殺害，做母親的毫無權力加以保護，只好暗自傷心了。</p>
<p>其實，按照科學的原理，上面的觀念是完全謬誤的。現在我把　生與怪胎的關係來作一個比較淺近的說明。</p>
<p>生的機會，根據科學家格羅立區氏調査的結果：大約雙生是八十五個產婦中可能產生一個；三生的比例是七千比一；四生約六十七萬五千比一；當然，五生的機會更少。</p>
<p>至於發生　生的原因，大別有二種可能性：第一種是卵巢中有兩個卵子同時發育，各自受精而產生兩個個體，這種　生兒可能是同性的，也可能是異性的。第二種是一個受精卵受刺激而起平均分裂，各自發育成個體，因爲這類　生是從一個身體分裂出來的。所以，他們的性別，容貌，和性情往往完全相同，有的時候，連他們的父母都不能把他們辨別出來。譬知，數年前在好萊塢主演「乞丐皇帝」影片的那對　生兄弟，就非一般觀衆所能辨別。</p>
<p>像上面這種　生在胚胎的初期不曾完全分離，後來就演發成一頭二身，或者二頭一身的各種怪胎了。另外一種情形，就是母體內的溫度，養料，空氣等，因環境不正常，受精卵受到局部的障礙，可能產生缺少某部分肢體的怪胎。</p>
<p>譬如，胚胎學家魯克斯氏曾做過這樣的實騐：他將尚未完全分離的受精卵，用紅熱的針刺死其中一個，結果，長成的個體殘缺不全。又如德生物學家史配門氏將蠑螈的胚胎，用幼童的頭髮四周繞縛，局部發育受到阻礙，結果，也發生二頭或二尾等怪胎。</p>
<p>所以，怪胎並不像普通那種迷信的解釋，不必將他當毒蛇一般的可怕，更不慼對產婦加以挪揄和蔑視，以免產生種種的悲劇！</p>
<h3>誤人子弟</h3>
<p>— 李錦祥</p>
<p>無容異議，教育是神聖的，但，神聖並不能當飯吃，當衣穿，　了敎書，　了粉筆灰生涯而度靑春，他們爲的是什麽呢？為國家培養人材，爲敎育神聖？抑是爲生活？各人的解答不同。</p>
<p>在今日的教育界，敎師們每月拿了一筆餓不死的薪金，刻板式地，月月如此，學期結束，暑期開始……他們自己也弄不情寒署的交替，日月的飛駛，他們依稀地記得有許多從前在自己那兒受訓過的學生，現在已成了聞人，富商，社會上的大亨，但回顧自己，依然故我，只不過身上的粗布衫又多上幾個破洞吧了！</p>
<p>敎育是神聖的，但總不能爲了敎育而餓肚子呀！</p>
<p>老敎師大都拋棄了書本子，離開了敎育界去幹不神聖的工作去了，空下的位子自有一批初出茅廬的學子去塡補，他們根本就沒有過敎學經騐，學生的問題常會使他們張口結舌，不能應對，於是爲了面子關係，辭職不幹，因此，敎師三日一掉，五日一換，一學期下來，書本沒敎到一半，敎師倒換了半打以上，此種風氣，以中小學校爲最。</p>
<p>敎育界之不景氣，這也是原因之一，在今日各校整頓學風聲中，希望各校對於校內敎師的學問程度敎學經騐應特別注意。</p>
<h3>市體育館收費問題</h3>
<p>— 宋蓮</p>
<p>昨天，陪朋友上陝西南路市體育館（舊回力球塲）去瞧排球，聽見該館姚先生（專門管理出借塲地的）說：「現在，因爲地板新鋪的，每天得上蠟，耗費甚大，以後借爲子將以每小時（日間）四千元計，而夜間練球得加電燈費四千元（即夜間每小時八千元），每球隊還要付保證金二萬元云」。</p>
<p>我聽了這話很覺奇怪。「市體育館又不是私人的，一切開支當由政府撥給。無論如何不能在「球隊」頭上來轉念頭！</p>
<p>我更奇怪；所收的費用居然會比私人的塲費還要來得貴。八仙橋靑年會球場每小時祇收一千元！</p>
<p>我覺得：每隊二萬元的保證金是應當繳付的，等到借期滿了，如果沒有什麽意外事件發生，自當退還！</p>
<p>如果，市體育館一定要納費的話，亦必需較私人的塲費要來得便宜才對！</p>
<p>最後，希望市體育館諸執事先生，對於這尚未公佈的消息做再三的考慮。</p>
<h3>美國兵</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>自從勝利以來，美國兵常就成了大家的話柄。仔細研究起來，毀譽是參半的，一方面，他們駕着風馳電掣的吉普車，擁着吉普女郎過市的時候，人家都側目以視，但他們的坦白爽直，也很能博人的同情。下文是美國人眼中的美國兵，原文載軍人文摘，茲將其侈譯，亦可稍窺他們自我批判吧。</p>
<p>深愛家園譏嘲任何外國事物：感情激動的美國兵，常自信他自己，他的家鄕高于一切，而對外國的一切加以譏嘲。</p>
<p>坦白誠懇但爲商人所欺：美國兵皆極誠懇，坦白，友誼，對任何人，他深信皆爲無辜：除非業經證實。但是，因爲他的正眞，自傲，就常會被商人所欺！</p>
<p>容忍外國哲學但容易在驢車後發怒：美國是一個年輕的國家，因此國民性偏于樂觀，當見外國人的躊躇遲疑時，雖是迷惑，但都極度容忍。在狹路上，前面爲驢車攔路時，却要大喊：「這是他們自己不好弄得這樣窮，他們仍舊是遲慢的，驢拖的文化。我們克服困難都是從來不要人家帮助的」？</p>
<p>尊敬本國女郎，但將外國婦人看作淫婦：美國兵的友誼眞而深；他對本國女郎都七分尊重，除非證實她們幷不高貴，但是，在國外，他把一切外國的婦女，都看作淫婦妓女。</p>
<p>能受艱苦，但思家時大發稚氣：美國兵遭遇任何傷害，他都能忍受。他不需要同情，右手失了，他就利用左手，但是當他們患思家病時，他們就大發稚氣，爭嚷回家。</p>
<p>自尊權利但接受上級命令時有憤色：雖然四年的軍訓，他對自己權利的自尊幷未减削，他是自尊者，也是民主時代中最大的希望者。但是他幷未明白頒發命令者常負較重的責任，他妒忌上級的軍曾上尉，但同時他希望容易的升遷。</p>

<h3>緬甸叢林間</h3>

<h3>啼笑皆非</h3>
<p>— 芷芬</p>
<p>善鐘路某中學，生物敎師在考試時，非但學生做弊不管，而每一個學生考好時，他還要替學生開門，學生都發笑，他說：「這有什麽希奇，先生是學生的公僕，學生是先生的衣食父母。」</p>
<p>又有某歷史敎師考試時，學生都翻書，有兩個學生居然尋不着，於是對先生說：「先生，你這題目恐怕出錯了，怎麽書上尋不着？」先生說：「你們這班學生眞笨，怎麽書都不會翻！」於是先生就代他們翻了出來。</p>
<p>靜安寺路某中學，因爲房東要收回校舍，並且沒有和校董會講好，就要將傢具搬進來，就有數十個學生自動住到學校裏來，於是白天是敎室，晚上却做了宿舍。</p>
<p>某著名大學，一年級國文敎師是寗波人，這位先生對學生說：「你們在英國讀書要說英語，在法國讀書要說法語，現在你們在我寗波先生這裏讀畫，所以你們一律要說寗波話。</p>
<h3>老人之心（上）</h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>江蘇敎育界老前輩袁希洛先生忽然大發慈悲，發出一道絕食的通電，要奉勸延安的朱毛二公莫忘記同爲炎黃的子孫，救救蘇北三百萬難民，雖不會有什麽效果，但至少也是時代的呼聲。儘管「人道主義」這思想，已被倡行「獸道」者公認爲落伍；然總不能否定自己是能說漂亮的話，能談戀愛，能兩脚直立，用手爭取物品，或發表高見，而與獸類有着顯著差異的人類。當以三百多萬人這一個龐大的數目字，來記載一筆將要絕命的難民，袁老先生偶然發出一聲同情的呼籲，在任何方面說，總不算是不道德。前幾天，度九十生日的英國大文豪蕭伯納先生曾經說過幾句老實話：「現在，共產主義變成最時髦的化裝品了，年靑人不信奉共產主義，就找不到愛人，一事無成的中年人，祇要信奉共產主義，就能一舉而名聞世界，老年人更要信奉共產主義，否則就永遠落後，永遠不會前進了。「現在，這位袁老先生却不願前進，反自甘落後，竟有胆量冒『天下之大不　？』同情於蘇北三百萬難民之流亡，可憐無數無依無靠的孩子們將要餓死，慘死，眞是其志可　，其愚不可及也！</p>
<p>中國人最聰明，最現實，又最愛面子，如果看看自己已什麽都要不得，將變成「朽木不可雕」的廢料時，他們馬上就會靈機一動，像押寶似的，看中了「名利雙輝」的一門，孤注一擲，以便輕而易舉地滿足自己的願望。在這裏，我又記起葉楚傖老先生的話來，他說：『革民黨這塊招牌，在辛亥年最走運，最行時，當　國父在南京就任臨時總統時，大江南北，全國各地，到處充滿着革命黨，你去問問在茶館裏喝老茶的鄕下佬，是不是革民黨，一定不加思索地回答：「是的！」問問蹬在毛坑上出恭的，問問拆字，算命，卜課，做文明戲的，以及在澡堂裏擦背，修脚的，以及在理髮室剃頭，划耳朶的，都能一流如水地回答：「是的！是的！」至於那些號稱士大夫的先生們，更不必說了。到第二年袁世凱要做皇帝，大量捕殺革命黨，宋敎仁，陳英士蒙難的消息，在民權報民立報大書特書時，一個緊急的風聲，傳遍全國，奇怪倒是那些士大夫階級——所謂社會的知識份子，嚇得屁滾屎流，連夜焚燒革命的小册子，以及民權報，民立報，燒到隻字不留，他們縱不一定是袁世凱的順民，但至少誰也不承認是革民黨了。而那些做文明戲的，倒還是在上海宣傳革命，那些擦背，修脚的，還在澡堂裏和浴客們大談革命黨怎樣從雨花台神策門攻破南京城，自以爲他們也是革命黨，引以自豪呢！」業老先生也是說的老實話。</p>

<h3>褚逆難逃死罪</h3>

<h3>Chairman Ma and Marshal Held a Long Talk Yesterday; President Song Arrived at Kuling to Participate in Consultations; U.S. Troops in China Not Considering Withdrawal for the Time Being</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kuling Dispatch, 4th] Marshal Special Envoy Marshall paid a visit to Chairman Chiang at 8:30 PM on the 4th. It is said that the conversation lasted for about two hours, and the content was not released. However, according to reliable sources, the two sides briefly discussed the report on the "Anping Incident."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Kuling Dispatch, 4th] Marshal Marshall went to the headquarters to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang at 8:30 PM on the evening of the 4th. President Song Ziwen was also present. It is reported that the content of the talk involved the Anping Incident. It was not until 10:00 PM that Chairman Chiang and Marshall and Song walked out of the headquarters, accompanied by Madam Chiang and Marshal's wife, and strolled along a stream for ten minutes before parting.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kuling Dispatch, 4th] Special Envoy Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 4th and had a long talk lasting for an hour. It is reported that Marshal Marshall stated that peace talks would be very difficult to proceed with until the U.S. military attack incident was resolved. Regarding the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China, Ambassador Stuart believes that it is not yet likely to be implemented.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kuling Dispatch, 4th] Ambassador Stuart, Marshal's wife, and Madam Chiang all went to church for service at 11:00 AM on the 4th. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, Ambassador Stuart responded to a visit from Special Envoy Marshall, talking for half an hour. It is reported that the Ambassador will pay another visit to the Chairman on the 5th and is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 6th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kuling Dispatch, 4th] According to Ambassador Stuart, he told our newspaper reporter that he and the Chinese government had both received a report on the "Anping Incident" and that he was now awaiting orders from Washington to handle the matter. He hopes that this unusual and unfortunate incident will not affect normalcy. As the Ambassador said this, he was leaning against the window reading a book, with a calm and composed demeanor and a kind smile, which shows the Ambassador's warm friendship towards China, enthusiasm, and patience.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] It is rumored that President Truman has authorized Special Envoy Marshall to make his own judgments in order to gradually withdraw U.S. troops from China to avoid unexpected events such as the Anping Incident from happening again. This statement was denied by Marshal Marshall's office, which stated that they had never heard of it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kuling Dispatch, 4th] President Song arrived in Kuling from Shanghai at 7:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. Without going to the Sun-illuminated Peak mansion to rest, he went directly to the headquarters to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang, reporting on administrative affairs and making requests. He left after about an hour. President Song said: (1) He intends to discuss the Anping Incident with Minister Peng before reporting it further. (2) Regarding the bombing incident in Yan'an, because he only saw it in the newspapers, he did not know the details. (3) He (Song referring to himself) has decided to rush back to Nanjing on the 5th to attend the regular meeting of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Kuling Dispatch, 4th] President Song's arrival in Kuling was warmly welcomed by all circles. When President Song entered the streets of Kuling, he got out of the sedan chair and talked to reporters while walking, saying that he had been away from Lushan for more than ten years.</p>
<h3>Kirk Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Kuling; Visited the Chairman and Discussed Training Our Navy; Kept the Contents of Talks with Marshal and Others Confidential</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kuling Dispatch, 4th] U.S. Commander of the Fleet in China, Admiral Kirk, left Kuling at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 4th with his wife, son, and daughter to go to Nanjing via Shanghai, escorted down the mountain by Staff Officer Pi Zonggan. Before descending the mountain, Admiral Kirk met with our newspaper reporter. He said that he was deeply grateful for the warm hospitality of Chairman Chiang and his wife during this trip to the mountain and had a pleasant few days of leisure. Regarding the U.S. military attack incident on the Pingjin Highway, Admiral Kirk gave a detailed account of the incident, saying that according to reports, the incident was perpetrated by the 53rd Regiment of the Communist Army. Three U.S. soldiers were killed and ten were injured. The U.S. military included officers from the Executive Headquarters, who were transporting supplies from Tianjin to the Executive Headquarters in Peiping, including some Executive Headquarters materials. The transport team regularly traveled from Tianjin to Peiping twice a week. This time, there were indeed many people lying in ambush in advance. They were attacked before they could resist. However, Admiral Kirk declined to comment on the content of his talks with Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart. At the same time, he also said that he was not in a position to express the attitude of the U.S. government and his personal opinions. Admiral Kirk went on to say that after arriving on the mountain, he had discussed with the Chairman the issue of jointly training the Chinese Navy, and the U.S. had donated a total of sixteen ships to our country.</p>
<p>[United Press Kuling Dispatch, 4th] Admiral Kirk told reporters today that he had reported to Chairman Chiang on the progress of the Chinese Navy training program and discussed the Anping Incident. Kirk flatly denied the communist claim that U.S. Marines attacked the communist army, saying that a U.S. convoy carrying Executive Headquarters items to the Executive Headquarters in Peiping to be handed over to U.S. officers was ambushed by the communist army en route. When asked what steps the U.S. government would take, Kirk replied that he did not know.</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Admiral Kirk recently denied rumors that U.S. Marines would soon withdraw from North China. Kirk returned to Shanghai from Kuling and stopped here briefly. It is reported that Kirk had discussed various outstanding issues with Marshal Marshall in Kuling last night, so Kirk did not need to participate in the two's talks again this morning.</p>
<p>[Our City News] Admiral Kirk returned to the Hua Mao Hotel on the fifth floor yesterday from Kuling and hosted Chinese and foreign reporters to report on something.</p>
<p>The Eleventh War Zone Announced the Details of the Anping Case</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Peiping Dispatch, 3rd] A spokesman for the Eleventh War Zone announced the details of the attack on the U.S. military by the communist army near Xianghe, stating: On July 29, when 41 U.S. Marine Corps officers and soldiers were suddenly attacked by the communist army near Anping Town, Commander Sun attached great importance to it and immediately ordered Deputy Chief of Staff Song Yuan of the war zone, along with Commissioner Huang Rencai of the Fifth District, County Magistrate Ban Changhui Ru of Xianghe, and others, to go to the scene of the incident to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Deputy Chief of Staff Song Yuan and others arrived at Matou Town at 6:00 AM on the 2nd. After inquiring with the garrison, they went to Anping Town to conduct a detailed on-the-spot investigation with the local gentry. The location of the U.S. military attack was near the Dasha River Village, about eight li southeast of Anping Town. This area is the junction of Tong County, Wuqing, and Xianghe counties. Deep ditches have been dug on both sides of the road, and dense corn has been planted next to the ditches for concealment. According to the villagers, U.S. military vehicles are often seen passing through this road, and no accidents have occurred. Recently, about 400 to 500 members of the 53rd Regiment (14th Military Sub-district) of the Communist Army, led by Li Minxi, often appear in nearby villages, wearing mostly gray military uniforms and civilian clothes, forcibly distributing food and intercepting pedestrians. On July 25, they convened an anti-American movement meeting for the villagers. On July 27 and 28, they blockaded traffic in the area southeast of Anping Town, blocked news, and intercepted pedestrians, intending to make preparations in that area. After the villagers knelt down and begged to avoid the scourge of war, they refused. At 12:20 PM on the 29th, they ambushed in the deep ditches on both sides of the Dasha River road and in nearby villages and woods, and forcibly grabbed the people's ox carts to block the road. When U.S. military trucks passed through the area, they were suddenly attacked by the ambush. When asked about the battle at the time, they said: "We, the common people, dare not go to see it. We only know that three U.S. soldiers were killed and more than a dozen were injured. The communist army also suffered dozens of casualties. That evening, they left in a northeast direction. We dare not ask where they went. Before leaving, they took away an old man from the town because he knew how to shoot. At 4:00 PM, Deputy Chief of Staff Gao returned to Peiping with the mediation personnel after the truth had been revealed. According to the Anping Town Xiaosha River, the first squadron of the Xianghe County Police was stationed there before June 2. Later, due to the adjustment of defense affairs, the squadron was transferred to Shicao (two li southwest of Matou Town), and no national army has been stationed there since.</p>
<h3>The Attack on the U.S. Military Was a Premeditated Communist Conspiracy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kuling Dispatch, 4th] According to a certain authoritative source, "The Communist Party has publicly admitted the 'Anping Incident.' It is said that the U.S. military travels back and forth on the Pingjin Road to transport supplies to the U.S. military personnel belonging to the Peiping Military Mediation Department twice a week. Its mission is very clear. The Peiping Military Mediation Department is an organization shared by the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the United States. The Communist Party's claim that the U.S. military and the National Army attacked the 'Liberated Areas' is a slanderous statement. It is evident that the occurrence of this incident was a premeditated act. We should pay attention to this kind of 'suspicious' propaganda by the Communist Party."</p>
<h3>Three Seriously Wounded U.S. Soldiers Sent to Qingdao for Treatment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Peiping Dispatch, 4th] Of the twelve U.S. soldiers who were wounded in the attack in Dasha River Village on July 29, three were seriously wounded and were transported by special plane to Qingdao on the morning of the 2nd and handed over to the U.S. Naval Hospital Ship Repose for treatment. In addition, several of the wounded U.S. soldiers who remained in Peiping with minor injuries have been discharged from the hospital, and those who have not yet been discharged are all in good condition. In recent days, many official and civilian representatives have gone to express their condolences.</p>

<h3>Government Aircraft Did Not Pass Over Yan'an While Performing Missions; Spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense Refutes the Communist Party's Attempt to Stir Up Trouble</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] A spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense made a statement on the 4th, stating: A National Army aircraft lost its way on June 26 and was forced to land in the northern suburbs of Yan'an. Later, because it was unable to fly back, the Air Force authorities dispatched a plane to destroy the aircraft on the 2nd of this month. It was found that the aircraft was parked in the mountains near the Yan'an suburbs airport, and the dispatched aircraft did not pass over Yan'an while performing this mission. Recently, Yan'an Radio has been publicizing that National Army aircraft bombed Yan'an, which is purely a fictitious story fabricated by the Communist Party to sensationalize.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The bombing of Yan'an has caused an unwarranted panic among the Communist Party delegation. However, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, the bombing was carried out because the aircraft that was previously forced to land in Yan'an could not be retrieved, so the target was clearly not their "headquarters," but the aircraft. The Communist Party's claim that the bombing of Yan'an was a "signal of the launch of a full-scale civil war" shows that they are doing their utmost to provoke. A certain military official said: "We naturally only bombed that one aircraft. If we wanted to bomb Yan'an, why would we wait until today?" The Communist Party spokesman's claim of "unprecedented seriousness" is of unknown basis.</p>
<h3>The Communist Party is Making Unfounded Accusations</h3>
<p>The National Army No Longer Has the 92nd Division</p>
<p>How Can There Be a Matter of the Capture of the Commander and Deputy Commander?</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Regarding the "capture of the commander and deputy commander of the 92nd Division of the National Army" mentioned by Xinhua News Agency on August 2, the reporter visited a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense to inquire about the truth. The spokesman said that the National Army no longer has the 92nd Division after the reorganization. Part of the 92nd Brigade of the National Army stationed in the Yugou area southeast of Xuzhou was attacked by the Communist Army on July 28 and retreated slightly. Ai, the commander of the 92nd Brigade, and Shen Shengkai, the deputy commander, personally led their troops to reinforce them and repelled the Communist Army. Xinhua News Agency first fabricated the story that Commander Ai had been captured. On the 3rd, Yan'an Radio used the excuse of a misreport and denied it itself. It can be seen that the Communist Party's propaganda has always been unfounded and has no factual basis.</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff Chen Arrived in Kuling; Inspected the Garrison While Passing Through Xunyang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Kuling Dispatch, 4th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng arrived in Kuling from Nanjing at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. While passing through Xunyang, he inspected the troops led by Liang Bo and met with Major General Zhang Rizhang, the commander of the gunboat flotilla, to inquire about the Yangtze River defense. After arriving in Kuling, he went directly to his private residence at No. 106 Zhonglu to rest. The Chief of Staff's wife and his six children, both male and female, came with him. The Central News Agency reporter went to welcome him between Banshanting and Xiaotianchi. The Chief of Staff said that his stomach ailment had healed for three weeks and that he did not feel tired after a five-hour long air journey today. When asked about military and political issues, the Chief of Staff promised to talk about them in detail tomorrow.</p>
<h3>A Communist Army Instructor in Shandong Abandoned Darkness and Defected in Jinan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Jinan Dispatch, 4th] Li Guowei, the political instructor of the Communist Army's Weihe Detachment in Western Shandong, witnessed the Communist Army's harming the country and the people and its obvious crimes. Unwilling to be deceived and used, he took advantage of the opportunity of being sent to Jinan to carry out assassination work on the 3rd and defected to the Second Pacification Zone Command, and personally wrote an autobiography, announcing his permanent withdrawal from the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Chairman Decided to Personally Preside Over Summer Camp Commemorative Week</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kuling Dispatch, 4th] Chairman Chiang will personally preside over the commemorative week of the Lushan Summer Camp tomorrow morning, and all the highest political workers in Lushan will also participate. After the commemorative week, the Chairman will summon the leaders of the summer camp above the battalion level for instructions. Also, at 9:00 AM on August 7, the Chairman will go to the summer camp to summon all the officials for a roll call and speech.</p>
<h3>The U.S.'s Established China Policy Will Definitely Not Be Changed</h3>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Chairman Chiang is now in Kuling, consulting with Marshall and Stuart, and all parties believe that the situation is "extremely serious." Chinese officials pointed out that the U.S.'s China policy has been clarified by Secretary of State Burns and approved by President Truman, and is unlikely to be changed at this time. It is uncertain whether it will affect the U.S.'s already established China policy even after the situation is clarified. The Communist Party is now continuing to exert pressure on the U.S. military authorities to "withdraw from China." The Communist Party's newspapers have stated: "We reiterate our demand that the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force completely withdraw from China as a permanent solution." Nanjing newspapers quoted a U.S. military spokesman as saying that the United States deeply regrets this incident, but all U.S. troops will not immediately withdraw from China because they are staying in China at the request of Chairman Chiang. When asked for his thoughts on the Anping Incident, he replied: "I heard that Marshall told the 'Central Daily News' that it was 'extremely bad.'"</p>
<h3>The U.S. Has Issued a Warning to Yan'an Regarding the Marine Corps Attack Incident; Gillem Says the Work of the Military Advisory Group is Intensifying</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency This City Dispatch] U.S. Commander in China General Gillem met with reporters yesterday and said that the United States and China have always been good friends and fought side by side during the war to defeat the enemy. This is an undeniable fact that is obvious to all. Today, with the end of World War II, we are working for the safety of the world and the future peace of mankind. This task is even more important and requires more effort and struggle from us. The United States has always hoped to cooperate with China and work for the safety of mankind. After the Anping Incident, the U.S. military has issued a warning to Yan'an. General Gillem did not want to make any further comments. The reporter then asked that the U.S. public opinion has different criticisms on the Chinese incident recently, and some people have written articles not long ago, advocating stopping the transportation of military supplies to China. The general refused to criticize this matter, but expressed that China and the United States are friendly, and the US is willing to help China solve its difficulties. He also stated that people engaged in journalism also bear a major responsibility for world security, and the world's people today should all strive for this goal. General Gillem has been in the military for more than 30 years and participated in the First and Second World Wars. He solemnly stated that maintaining world peace is not only the duty of soldiers, but also the responsibility of all mankind. When the reporter inquired about the exact date of the U.S. military's withdrawal from Shanghai, he was unwilling to announce it and only said that it was in the near future. Gillem himself will postpone the announcement of any position after the end of the command. The closure of the U.S. military command in Shanghai is because their mission has been completed, and the military advisory group in Nanjing and the military mediation department in Peiping will continue their tasks. When talking about the military advisory group, General Gillem said that the agency is intensifying its work. If peace in China is achieved soon, the work of training the Chinese army, navy, and air force can be actively carried out. The Chinese side has sent more than 100 instructors to the United States for advanced studies, and they will also participate in the work of the advisory group after returning to China. The advisory group is currently planning to select a suitable location for the training camp for the army. The group has a large number of specialized military personnel from the United States. Finally, the reporter asked about his impression of China. The general smiled and said, "Very good," and detailed his daily life for the reporter. In his spare time, the general likes to play baseball. Every weekend, he often organizes baseball teams to play friendly baseball games at his private residence.</p>
<h3>Negotiating to Mediate the Conflict in the Central Plains; Li Xiannian Has Not Yet Responded; Cheng Qian Reports on the Communist Army's Attack</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Hankou Dispatch, 3rd] The heads of the Party, government, military, and groups in Wuhan jointly hosted reporters today, presided over by Director Cheng Qian and Chairman Wan Yaohuang. Director Cheng reported on the spot, saying: "Since June 26, Li Xiannian's Communist Army has violated the Luoshan Agreement and launched a large-scale offensive, leading his troops from the east of the Pinghan Railway, crossing the Pinghan Road to the west, and attacking the National Army along the way, killing civilians, and burning houses. Its main force has captured Xinye and Jingziguan and is still occupying the area west of Shanyang, actively preparing for war. Another part has captured Yicheng, Nanzhang, Baokang, Zhushan, and other counties. Our government still adheres to the principle of peace and has sent the Ninth Group to Laohekou by plane, sending a notice by plane, inviting Li Xiannian to send representatives to conduct peace talks again. Despite repeated urgings, they have all been rejected. As of now, a force of more than a thousand has sneaked to Zhuyuhe in the west of Zhushan, and its vanguard has sneaked to Bainenggou (at the junction of Zhu Xi and Luoping counties). Another force of about a thousand has sneaked west from Shihua Street to the area south of Wufushan, attempting to penetrate the border area between Sichuan and Hubei in order to achieve their ambition of separating and dominating. Today, Li Xiannian's ferocity is unreasonable, but the government still hopes that peace is not hopeless and will not abandon its original intention of peace. On the 28th of last month, the three-person group made a temporary agreement stipulating that both sides would temporarily cease the conflict and invited Li Xiannian to go to Xi'an for peace talks before August 5. Whether this agreement will be successful depends on whether Li Xiannian goes or not. If he does not go at that time, or does not send representatives, it is willing to destroy peace and abandon the people of the country, then the agreement will be invalid."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Hankou Dispatch, 3rd] The Ninth Group, stationed in Laohekou for more than half a month to mediate the conflict in the Central Plains, sent four letters to Li Xiannian last month, inviting him to send representatives to Longjuzhai to negotiate with the 32nd Group, but received no response. Before the group prepared to fly to Xi'an and then to Peiping for instructions, they met with the Communist representatives in Laohekou and reached a temporary agreement that a ceasefire period would be provisionally set from 4:00 AM on the 2nd to the 20th. The agreement stipulated that the agreement would be signed in Xi'an on the 25th. The Ninth Group flew back to Hankou on the 1st and flew to Xi'an from Hankou at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd. Regardless of whether Li Xiannian fulfills the agreement, they will fly to Peiping.</p>
<h3>Cars Between Tianjin and Yangcun Were Twice Robbed by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tianjin Dispatch, 4th] In addition to destroying railways, the Communist Army has recently been obstructing highway traffic. Cars traveling between Tianjin and Yangcun were robbed twice on the 18th and 29th of last month. Now the drivers and station staff have returned to Tianjin, proving that it was done by the Communist Army. It is reported that seven trucks were also robbed in Beicang, 20 li north of Tianjin. The Communist Army told commercial vehicles that anyone carrying more than 100,000 yuan in cash or transporting food would be detained.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces in Northern Jiangsu Retreat Towards Gaoyou; National Army Recovers Dayiji; Military and Political Personnel Stationed in Three Counties of Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>[Our Yangzhou Dispatch, 4th] The Yang-Tian Highway was cleared on the 4th. National Army forces have joined at Dayiji. Communist forces are retreating towards Gaoyou. Remaining communist elements southwest of Gaoyou Lake are awaiting complete suppression. As a result, the communication line from Tianchang in Anhui, through Yangzhou and Taixian in Jiangsu, to Haian Town has been completely recovered. Full traffic on the road is expected imminently. This is a significant gain since the National Army's counteroffensive in Jiangsu and Anhui.</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Dispatch, 4th] (1) Our army advancing from Tangdong, after joining forces with troops stationed in Haian, is currently pursuing and suppressing communist forces gathered at Fuanji and Yijiaji. The communist 7th Column, originally stationed in Haian, is still stubbornly resisting after hastily constructing fortifications there.

(3) Approximately one regiment of communist forces still occupies Jingjia Village, and is reinforcing its defenses. (4) A small number of militia are harassing the vicinity of Dabaimi. They retreated after the defending National Army counterattacked. (5) On the Tianchang front, our army recovered Dayiji at 9:00 AM today.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] (1) The bulk of communist forces in Taixian have been suppressed. However, remnant communist elements in the Mojiazhuang area, north of Dabaimi Town, still attempt to cause trouble. (2) On the Yang-Tai Highway, the remaining communist 82nd Division is stationed at Qilidian, and the 88th Division is stationed at Yiling, both with the intention of disrupting and attempting to cut off the Yang-Tai Highway. (3) New Fourth Army elements were discovered in Yangshu Town, southwest of Jingjiang. They were repelled by the National Army today. (4) After the National Army joined forces and recovered Haian, the communist forces in the Dongtai area have no defensible positions. However, as of today, there has been no significant progress in the fighting.</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Dispatch, 4th] (1) The National Army advancing north in the Rugao area, proceeding from Faqiao, recovered Haian yesterday morning. A large number of spoils were seized. The three regiments of the communist 7th Column stationed in the town retreated towards Dongtai. The National Army is pursuing and suppressing them, and is currently confronting them a few li north of the town. (2) After the National Army recovered Haian, advancing troops from the Qutang area eliminated all resistance, advanced eastward, and officially joined forces with friendly forces in Haian. It is reported that the communist forces in northern Jiangsu, attempting to threaten Nanjing and Shanghai and create a separatist regime, launched an offensive against Liangtai and Tongyang areas starting on the 13th of last month. The National Army, responsible for defending the territory, was forced to fight back and, in order to protect the capital and relieve the people's suffering, successively advanced into Gongqiao, Meiyan, Qutang, Baimi, Rugao, Haian, and other places. Now, the three strongholds of northern Jiangsu, Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Nantong, have been unified. The situation in northern Jiangsu will enter a new phase. (3) According to informed sources, the Tong-Tai Highway will be officially opened to traffic within a few days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hefei Dispatch, 4th] It is reported that the communist forces in Sixian, Wuhe, and Xuyi counties have all retreated. Our military and political personnel have entered the cities to handle pacification and post-disaster affairs.</p>

<h3>How Cruel are the Communists! The Grand Canal Embankment in Shandong is Breached Again; Water in Liaocheng is Several Feet Deep; Tens of Thousands of Lives Will Be Buried in the Belly of Fish</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan Dispatch, 4th] It is heard from informed sources: On the night of July 31st, communist forces breached the Grand Canal embankment, causing water to flow into Liaocheng. Tens of thousands of lives in the city are in danger of being buried in the belly of fish. Liaocheng has been besieged by communist forces for seven months. Commissioner Wang Jinxiang led the military and civilians in a firm defense. The communist forces have repeatedly attacked without success. Recently, they dug up the embankment, and the water flowed directly into the city gates. The water outside the east gate is several feet deep and still rising. Residents downstream are the first to bear the brunt and have been submerged. Commissioner Wang has telegraphed the Jinan Party, government, and military authorities for emergency assistance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou Dispatch, 4th] The communist forces in northern Jiangsu have used every possible inhuman act. In addition to large-scale destruction of the embankments of the Yun and Mu rivers, making the southeastern areas of Xuzhou a watery expanse, their political workers have recently taken away more than 30,000 young women from northern Jiangsu to transport supplies in the mountains of southern Shandong, such as Fengshan and Mengshan. It is heard that they have already passed Muyang and are heading north.</p>
<h3>Wang Maogong Cables Li Moan Requesting the Suppression of Bandits in the Taihu Lake Area; New Fourth Army Worker Liu Pingzhi Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 4th] Wang Maogong, concurrently Commander of the Jiangsu Province Security Forces, believes that with the urgent military situation in northern Jiangsu, the security of the rear is extremely important. He discovered that the bandits in the Taihu Lake area are gathering in increasing numbers and even raising the false flag of the "Jiangnan Democratic Allied Army." This clearly indicates a significant political background and cannot be regarded as a minor ailment. Moreover, the lakeside area is frequently harassed, and the people are suffering. In terms of water transportation, Taihu Lake is an important artery for three provinces, with frequent traffic. Now, due to the rampant banditry, water transportation has disappeared, which has a profound and significant impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. If a fundamental solution is not promptly devised, it will inevitably lead to future troubles and endless harm. Therefore, he specifically telegraphed General Li Moan, Commander of the First Pacification Zone, to preside over the suppression operation and ordered the heads of the lakeside districts and counties to lead their local armed forces to cooperate with the garrison troops and form a strong force. They are to be concentrated in lakeside strongholds within a specified time limit, awaiting orders to move out. He also ordered the Second Water Police Corps to deploy ships and implement a planned mobile patrol to undertake the task of searching and arresting on the lake. He also stated that this suppression operation will be coordinated simultaneously with the Zhejiang Province authorities to prevent the bandits from fleeing and achieve a thorough eradication effect.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 4th] The military authorities stationed in Suzhou arrested a New Fourth Army worker named Liu Pingzhi at noon on the 3rd. Liu was found at No. 32, Qian Fan Village, Suzhou. A large amount of military radio equipment was confiscated. According to his confession, he served as a staff officer of the puppet 10th Division and had a very close personal relationship with Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Army. However, he vehemently denied participating in the work. All witnesses and evidence have now been transferred to the headquarters of the First Pacification Zone for verification.</p>
<h3>Two Daytime Robberies in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 4th] Banditry in Zhejiang Province is quite rampant, and public security is a significant problem. The Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, in order to ensure public safety, has strengthened its security forces and implemented armed patrols starting this month, which has been somewhat effective. However, two daytime robberies occurred again yesterday. One was at the Zonghui Pai Xiangyan Company near the City Station, where more than 4 million in cash and watches were stolen. The other was when a traveler outside Fengshan Gate was robbed of a large guard bag and a diamond ring.</p>
<h3>Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association Resolves on Three Important Cases</h3>

<h3>Sichuan Provincial Assembly Closes; Agreement Reached on Matters Related to Chairman's Telegram Regarding Actual Levy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu Dispatch, 3rd] The Sichuan Provincial Assembly held a temporary meeting on the 31st of last month to discuss the issue of the actual levy, which was successfully resolved. It closed on the morning of the 2nd. Before closing, it passed a reply to Chairman Chiang's telegram, roughly stating: "It is determined that this year's levy and loan of actual goods is necessary for the country and for the essential expenses of provincial and county governments. This assembly should obey your orders, share the difficulties together, and support the established national policy. Therefore, a temporary meeting was convened on July 31 to discuss the issue of the actual levy and loan of goods in Sichuan Province this year. It was unanimously agreed to approve the levy and loan of 4.5 million shi (unit of dry volume) in the city of Sichuan Province this year and resolved to fully assist in promoting it to ensure its smooth completion. However, with regard to the more than 2.3 million shi of market stone owed by the central government in treasury bills and interest, the Executive Yuan has clearly ordered its return to the people. Since this year's levy and loan has been promulgated, it should be allowed to be deducted from the levy amount by the people, as an expression of good faith, in accordance with the Yuan's order. Also, the 1.35 million shi of public grain in the province and counties should be properly allocated by the provincial government from the levy and loan amount, and past debts should be effectively recovered to make up for shortfalls and achieve a balance of income and expenditure. The additional levy should be waived to lay the foundation for provincial and county finances, the levy and loan amount should be verified and allocated, no additional share should be made, and long-standing malpractices should be eliminated to improve grain administration and be transferred for implementation."</p>

<h3>Xuzhou City Old Yellow River Silting Up, City Government Asks for Funds for Dredging</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Report] The old Yellow River in this city has been silted up for a long time. A few days ago, there was heavy rain, and the mountain torrents upstream burst, causing the river to rise suddenly. Fortunately, the military and civilians worked hard to block the floods, which stabilized. Now, in order to prevent problems, the city government decided to thoroughly dredge the river. It has ordered the responsible department of the Public Works Bureau to investigate and estimate the amount of dredging needed, which is 1,520,000 cubic meters of earthwork, 2,625 cubic meters of revetment stone, and 1,000 revetment wooden piles, with a total cost of 3,100,162,500 yuan.

<h3>Communist Male and Female Spies Infiltrate the Southern Section of the Jinpu Railway</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondence from this Newspaper in Bengbu] Since the Communist army launched an offensive toward northern Jiangsu, Communist spies lurking in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway have seized the opportunity to become active, attempting to sabotage transportation and carry out assassination plots. It is learned that the 5th Division of the New Fourth Army recently dispatched more than 40 male and female spies from eastern Hubei. The male spies disguise themselves as cobblers, while the female spies disguise themselves as prostitutes, and are active in the area from southern Henan to northern Anhui. The action team members dispatched by Chen Yusheng of the Communist army's independent brigade mostly disguise themselves as bricklayers and peddlers, lurking along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line. The Communist army in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, using the name of the Lifeng Company, has dispatched many secret agents disguised as pig traders to purchase military supplies.</p>

<p>A New Twist in the Lixin Labor Strike</p>
<p>At the Lixin Textile Factory under Wuqiao in this city, all the workers, in order to demand higher wages, profit sharing, and shorter working hours, and dissatisfied with the factory's welfare facilities, started a work slowdown on the 30th of last month. Representatives were repeatedly dispatched to make demands to the management, and relevant authorities mediated, but because the opinions of the two sides differed too greatly, the issue has not yet been resolved. On the 2nd, personnel from a certain agency went to the Lixin Factory to investigate, and because they were carrying foreign handcuffs, the workers, seeing this, suspected that they were going to use force to arrest workers, which caused a misunderstanding and another disturbance. More than 600 female workers gathered and went in a group to the Shigu River Cotton Textile Industry Workers' Union to report. The union sent personnel to the county government to inquire about the truth, saying that there was no such thing. After repeated explanations, they returned in a group. Although the Qingfeng Yarn Factory labor strike was resumed on the 29th of last month, the agreement reached by labor and management has not yet been fully implemented.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Iran Issue Resurfaces</h3>
<p>When Sir Samuel, the Indian representative, delivered a speech at the Paris Peace Conference, expressing concern about peace in the Middle East, British troops suddenly sailed from India to Basra, Iraq, to reinforce and protect British interests in southern Iran. The Iranian government believes that this move by Britain is tantamount to interfering in the country's internal affairs and has protested to the London authorities. The precarious situation in the Middle East, which had been stabilized for several months, has therefore become tense again.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, after the end of the victorious war, the intricate internal and foreign affairs of Iran have repeatedly caused international uproar and almost led to disaster. Fortunately, the countries concerned, especially the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were able to tolerate each other, and the Iranian government painstakingly eliminated domestic differences, which resulted in temporary tranquility. However, the international environment of Iran remains the same, but "open struggles" have been replaced by "covert struggles." In other words, although the Iranian issue has ostensibly been compromised, the "struggle" between Britain and the Soviet Union in Iran has not actually stopped, but has intensified. Judging from the political situation in Iran in recent months, Iran's politics do have a tendency to lean more toward the Soviet Union. Iranian Prime Minister Saed, though trying his best to remain detached and lead the people in organizing the Democratic Party to compete with the pro-Soviet Tudeh Party, his power is still insufficient to resist the Tudeh Party's deep penetration into the people, everywhere inciting anti-British sentiments among the Iranian people. As a result, a large-scale strike broke out in the oil field area of southern Iran on the 15th of last month, not only paralyzing the production of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, but also seriously threatening British interests in southern Iran. Because the local authorities had to maintain order among the 100,000 striking workers, they declared a state of emergency as a precaution; the striking workers, on the contrary, demanded the resignation of Governor Fatemi on the charge of being a "tool of the British." From this, it can be seen that the oil strike is by no means a simple strike, and it has an international background. For the sake of settling the situation, the Iranian government instructed Governor Fatemi to avoid conflicts with the striking workers, and this conciliatory attitude naturally had its unspeakable pain. The British authorities, seeing that the country's interests were not guaranteed, in addition to negotiating with the Iranian government, requesting it to immediately take emergency measures to protect the lives and property of British and Indian people in the south, also sent three naval vessels into the Persian Gulf, anchored outside the port of Abadan, to indicate that if British interests in southern Iran were threatened, they could take action at any time. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin also stated in the House of Commons that Iran should be fully responsible for the safety of British citizens within its borders. At that time, the situation was indeed tense for a time; but the events in Palestine suddenly occurred at this time, forcing Britain to shift its attention to the Palestinian issue, and the Iranian issue formed a situation of outward relaxation and inward tension.</p>
<p>During these two weeks of surface silence, the Iranian political situation took a sharp turn for the worse. The Democratic Party led by Prime Minister Saed and the pro-Soviet Tudeh Party reached a temporary understanding. The Iranian cabinet resigned en masse at the end of last month, so that Prime Minister Saed could reorganize a new cabinet, which was completed on the 1st of this month. Three members of the left-wing pro-Soviet Tudeh Party joined the new cabinet, and the cabinet was evenly divided between the "pro-Soviet faction" and the "pro-British faction." The reorganization of the Iranian cabinet is obviously unfavorable to Britain, and it goes without saying that the British government feels that the safety of British people in southern Iran is not guaranteed, and they have no choice but to take military action to protect their own interests.</p>
<p>Iran has protested to the British government over the concentration of British troops in Iraq. If this matter were purely a dispute between Britain and Iran, there would be no need to be alarmist and say that the situation in the Middle East is becoming tense again. But behind the British-Iranian conflict, there is also a powerful country, which is the neighboring Soviet Union in the north. It will never let go of Iran, and as the situation develops to the present, the Soviet Union's power in Iran has taken deep root, and Britain will not be its strong enemy. Recently, the Soviet diplomats also held three winning cards in their hands: (1) Princess Pari of Iran, the younger sister of the Iranian King, recently visited Moscow, and the Soviet government showed great hospitality and did everything possible to make contact; (2) The political advisor to Iranian Prime Minister Saed, who is also the spokesman for the Iranian government, Prince Firouz, as a representative of the pro-Soviet faction in the Iranian cabinet, personally went to southern Iran and released the arrested workers; (3) The pro-Soviet Tudeh Party has recently strengthened its propaganda offensive and also occupies three seats in the new cabinet, its position is becoming more and more consolidated, which is completely different from half a year ago.</p>
<p>On the British side, its influence in Iran is weakening day by day, and the tools it can rely on are also becoming less and less. Coupled with the troubles of the Palestinian issue, Britain is in a dilemma in Iran. Britain has already decided not to maintain its oil rights in Iran, otherwise it has no choice but to take severe measures. The British Labor government is reluctant to give up Palestine, and that is why. Churchill criticized the Labor government's Palestine policy, saying that it was abandoning the elephant to take the rat, which is very pertinent; but in the current international environment, if Britain wants to consolidate its position in the Middle East, even if the elephant is abandoned, the rat must still be contested.</p>
<p>In short, the "diplomatic war" between Britain and the Soviet Union in the Middle East has reached a fever pitch. Iran has a reputation as the powder keg of the Middle East. Since British troops have been concentrated in the area closest to the Iraqi-Iranian border, and there are also rumors that Iranian troops are moving south, coupled with the Soviet Union pulling the strings behind the scenes, with everyone playing with fire next to the powder keg, who can guarantee that it will not start a prairie fire? The bells of peace have been ringing constantly in Paris, and the political diplomats of 21 countries are now gathered in Paris. To prevent the recurrence of war, they should first put out this "spark" in the Middle East!</p>

<h3>The Paris Peace Conference Adjourned for One Day Yesterday; Representatives Engaged in Extracurricular Activities; Britain Proposed a Compromise on the Voting System Issue</h3>
<p>[News from this Newspaper] Paris, 4th Broadcast: Today is Sunday, and the Peace Conference is adjourned for one day, but the contact between the representatives outside the conference is frequent, and the voting issue is receiving the most attention from all parties. It is heard that the British side has proposed a compromise plan, the details of which are unknown, and the issue will likely be decided in the beginning of next week. According to general opinion, the major powers will have an advantage with a majority of eleven to ten.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] The importance of the matters to be discussed by the Rules Committee of the Peace Conference can be seen from the fact that the plenary session has been postponed to wait for the committee to complete its work. The committee is scheduled to reconvene on the morning and afternoon of the 5th of this month to discuss the issue of the majority required for voting on important matters. Regarding this matter, the four powers still believe that procedural matters can be passed by a simple majority vote of the plenary session, while other matters and suggestions must be passed by a two-thirds majority. The Brazilian representative once proposed that all motions and proposals should be passed by a simple majority vote, and the New Zealand representative also made a similar proposal. The British representative proposed a compromise plan to divide all proposals into two categories, some of which can be passed by a simple majority vote, while others must be passed by a two-thirds majority. All of these should be submitted to the Rules Committee for discussion. In addition, the committee should also discuss the voting procedures of various subcommittees. Regarding this level, the New Zealand representative has also submitted an amendment, arguing that all proposals passed by a simple majority of the subcommittee must be submitted to the plenary session for consideration. Political observers here believe that the above issues are extremely important and may cause lengthy debates.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] The major events of today's meeting are as follows: (1) The British representative declared that the four powers are expected to form a united front on all matters agreed upon in the draft peace treaty with the five countries. Although the Yugoslav representative fiercely criticized, the dispute over the port of Trieste will not be reopened. (2) The Canadian delegation announced that it will raise questions about the $10 billion reparations to the Soviet Union and will demand a thorough review of the situation. Australia also indicated that it will take the same action.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Issue of the Chairman of the Peace Conference; Five Powers to Rotate the Chairmanship; Dutch Amendment Rejected</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] The Rules Committee of the Peace Conference, after four and a half hours of discussion this afternoon, without a vote, agreed to the proposal of the foreign ministers of the four powers, and decided that the chairman of the conference would be rotated by the five powers: China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. Earlier, the Dutch representative suggested that the conference should freely elect the chairman, which was rejected by a vote of twelve to eight. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said in today's debate that he felt that discussing the peace treaty proposals was more important than who chaired the conference. The Rules Committee voted in favor of the Dutch amendment by Brazil, Australia, Belgium, Greece, India, New Zealand, South Africa, and the Netherlands. Those who opposed were the United States, Britain, Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia. Abyssinia abstained.</p>
<h3>Interlude at the Peace Conference; Movie Camera Tumbles; Foreign Minister Wang Nearly Injured</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd Special Dispatch] My country's chief representative Wang Shijie was nearly injured today, because a huge movie camera next to him fell and hit Lin Xianrang, an observer sitting behind Wang on the Rules Committee, and his left ear was slightly injured. However, the photographer was unintentional and was quite shocked.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd Special Dispatch] When the Rules Committee of the Peace Conference met today to discuss the issue of the Chairman of the Conference, China supported the rules proposed by the four powers, that is, the five member states of the Council of Foreign Ministers would take turns as Chairman. When Wang Shijie explained the reason for China's support for this rule, he said that it was based on factual reasons. In principle, China supported the Dutch amendment, that is, the conference had the right to elect its own Chairman. However, considering the actual situation, if the amendment was passed, it would cause new and complex problems and would not allow the work of the conference to proceed smoothly. The amendment is still under consideration, and after the final decision, the Chinese delegation will support the proposal made by the Council of Foreign Ministers on this matter based on this practical reason, and only for this reason. Wang said finally that China did not participate in the preparation of this proposal by the Council of Foreign Ministers.</p>
<h3>Chinese Should Be Listed as an Official Language of the Peace Conference; My Representative Guo Taiqi Proposed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 3rd Special Dispatch] At the meeting of the Rules Committee this morning, my country's delegation submitted a reservation on the issue of the rules for the adoption of official languages by the Paris Peace Conference. Article 4 of the procedural rules drafted by the four countries last month stated that "English, French, and Russian are the official and applicable languages in all plenary and committee meetings." During the discussion today, Guo Taiqi, a representative of my country, said that according to the United Nations Charter, Chinese is one of the five official languages. In the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting held in London last September, it was also agreed that important resolutions and documents should be translated into Chinese and distributed to various delegations. This method does not cost the conference extra time. In view of various technical difficulties, the Chinese delegation does not require the Paris Peace Conference to follow the above methods, but hopes to put this matter on record, that is, China does expect that in future meetings, especially the Far East Peace Conference dealing with Japan, Chinese will be listed as one of the official languages.</p>
<h3>Strict Security Around the Luxembourg Palace; French Soldiers Climb to the Rooftop for Day and Night Watch; Food Eaten by Representatives Is Inspected</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] Before each meeting of the Paris Peace Conference, French assault troops climb to the roof of the Luxembourg Palace for strict security. If they find suspicious persons, they are allowed to shoot before questioning them. The food eaten by the delegates to the conference is inspected in advance. There are three security police in each of the twenty hotels where the delegates reside, whose special duty is to check the items delivered to the delegates to prevent explosive devices, etc. Employees of the conference venue and hotel staff have been closely investigated by the police. Nazis are suspended from their duties during the conference. Special colored passes are issued to those related to the conference, with different colors every day, to prevent others from impersonating them. The security matters of the conference are the responsibility of Andre, the Secretary General of the French Security Police.</p>
<h3>British Troops Gather in Iraq; Iranian Government Protests</h3>
<p>Accusing Britain of Interfering in Its Internal Affairs</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 3rd Dispatch] It is announced here today: The Iranian government has obviously failed to maintain the law and order in the Anglo-Iranian oil region. The lives and properties of Indians and British, and the supply of gasoline to India are all threatened. Therefore, troops have been transferred from India to Basra, Iraq.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 3rd Dispatch] The government has just announced: The Iranian government protested today against the British concentration of troops in Iraq. According to a bulletin issued by the propaganda department, the Iranian government protested against the British troop concentration in Basra in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the Anglo-Iranian-Soviet tripartite treaty. According to a communique issued in New Delhi, the British troop concentration is intended to maintain security in southern Iran. The Iranian government will reiterate its protest against this interference in Iranian internal affairs.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 3rd Dispatch] Well-informed sources here recently said: News of the British troop concentration in the port of Basra in Iraq has greatly shocked Iran. Diplomatic observers believe that the organization of a new cabinet in Iran, which includes the pro-Soviet Labor Party (i.e., the Tudeh Party), is the reason for the British government's drastic measures, which aims to prevent anti-British propaganda movements in southern Iran, which is also the location of British economic interests. A certain left-wing newspaper here said that the British action interfered in Iranian internal affairs and threatened Iranian sovereignty. The Iranian government will appeal to the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd Dispatch] A spokesperson for the Foreign Office told a reporter from Agence France-Presse that people here are not surprised by the development of the situation in the Middle East. British troops from India are heading to Iraq because disputes broke out in southern Iran half a month ago, and precautionary measures had to be taken to avoid the recurrence of similar events. This troop movement was decided one day after the Abadan city strike. This decision was kept secret for military reasons. In short, London is quite calm about the situation. In addition, a diplomatic reporter for the Daily 　　reported that the British 　　　Iraq has made the situation very tense, and all parties concerned are extremely anxious.</p>
<h3>Italian Fleet: Rather Scuttled; British and American Delegations Receive Warning; Italian Foreign Minister Goes to Paris</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 4th Broadcast: The Italian Foreign Minister departed Rome for Paris today.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 4th Dispatch] Several newspapers this morning carried "Italian Fleet to Be Scuttled" as their top headline. According to these newspapers, the British and American delegations to the Paris Peace Conference have received a warning that Italian sailors would rather scuttle their own fleet than hand it over to other countries.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] Italian Deputy Prime Minister Nenni has completed discussions with French and other countries' politicians and will return to Rome on the 5th of this month. Regarding this matter, well-informed sources recently stated that Nenni will also meet with the Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister, who is the head of that country's delegation, Mr. Kardelj, although this has not been officially confirmed. Although the details of their meeting are not known to outsiders, it is said that they exchanged opinions and emphasized that although some politicians on both sides hope to foster friendly relations, due to border disputes, the general public on both sides are opposed, making it impossible to achieve at present.</p>
<h3>Turkish Cabinet Resigns En Masse</h3>
<p>Defense Minister Ordered to Form a Cabinet</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 4th Broadcast: The Defense Minister has been ordered to form a new cabinet.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Contest in the Middle East: A New Page Unfolds in Diplomatic Warfare</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd Dispatch] The British government has announced the dispatch of troops to Iraq, and the diplomatic war being waged by Britain and the Soviet Union in Tehran has opened a new chapter. London and Moscow are unwilling to compromise on the competition between the two countries in the Middle East. British Foreign Secretary Bevin, in his report to the House of Commons on July 17, did not publicly mention the pro-Soviet elements in southern Iran holding demonstrations to oppose the Anglo-Iranian oil companies, and for this reason. Moscow also avoids formally supporting the Tudeh Party, also for this reason. In fact, both sides are secretly putting pressure on the Iranian government, forcing it to declare that it is neither pro-British nor pro-Soviet. British and Soviet diplomats are engaged in a battle of wits with Iranian Prime Minister Sa'ed, each wanting to show their skills. On the Soviet side, they hold three winning cards: (1) Princess Pari-Visha, the Iranian King's younger sister, recently visited Moscow, and the Soviet government gave her a warm reception; (2) Prince Firouz, the political advisor and spokesman for Prime Minister Sa'ed, is a pro-Soviet representative in the Iranian cabinet and personally went to Abadan to release the arrested workers; (3) The Tudeh Party is strengthening its propaganda work, and its position in the cabinet is becoming more consolidated. On the British side, there are also three things to say: (1) Foreign Secretary Bevin declared that the Iranian government is fully responsible for the safety of British citizens within its borders; (2) The British cruiser "Norfolk" sailed to the Persian Gulf; (3) Troops were sent to reinforce areas near the border between Iraq and Iran.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Launches Another Propaganda Offensive Against the United States</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 3rd, United Press] Relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries seem to be approaching a new crisis today, as the Soviet Union has launched another propaganda attack against the United States. The Kremlin officially criticized the United States, saying, "The United States has formally established a new military class to control the atomic bomb and build a powerful armed force for offensive purposes." It also said, "The schemes of the reactionary governments of the West" have threatened the Paris Peace Conference, and all the industrial machinery in the American-occupied zone of Germany, which should have been used to compensate the Soviet Union according to the Potsdam Agreement, has been destroyed by the American side. The famous Soviet radio commentator, Lanski, promoted, "We should remember that the United States is now, for the first time in history, maintaining a large army, navy, air force, and atomic bombs in peacetime for offensive purposes. The purpose of the United States in manufacturing atomic bombs is certainly not for self-defense."</p>
<h3>The United States Attaches Great Importance to the Economic Aspects of the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Paris, 4th Broadcast: US Undersecretary of State Clayton delivered a radio address today, stating that since the end of the war, the United States has spent $200 billion to help revive foreign economies, which shows how much Americans value the economic aspects of the peace treaty. Countries that have suffered aggression have the inherent right to demand compensation from the aggressors, but the aggressors' ability to compensate should also be taken into account. In short, we cannot repeat the mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<h3>The United States Invites Representatives from Eleven Countries to Discuss the Issue of Japanese Reparations</h3>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 4th Dispatch] According to Washington, the US government has decided to convene a meeting of representatives from the eleven countries participating in the Far Eastern Commission, starting on the 15th, to discuss the issue of Japanese reparations. It is said that the invitations have been sent out. In the invitation, the US government emphasized that Japan's surrender is approaching its first anniversary, but the research work on the reparations issue has made no progress. It also stated that because it is not known what industries each country will allow Japan to retain, the work of dismantling Japanese economic equipment has been greatly delayed. The representatives of the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission should keep this proposal of the United States confidential before deciding on its implementation. It is speculated that the intention of the US government is, first, to have the United Nations recognize the distribution of Japanese military factories, and second, to resolve the entanglement of the Soviet Union's reparations issues in the Northeast as soon as possible. It is said that the American note to the eleven countries proposes that the method of determining reparations should take into account the Soviet Union's dismantling of industrial facilities in the Northeast. If the amount of compensation to be received by each country is determined according to the US proposal, the value of the Northeastern industrial facilities dismantled by the Soviet Union may be deducted from the amount of compensation to be received by the Soviet Union. According to well-informed sources in American diplomatic circles, the Soviet Union will vehemently oppose this, because Moscow has consistently insisted that these industrial facilities should not be used for general compensation, but are their "war trophies." Former US reparations envoy Pauley estimated that the Northeastern industrial facilities dismantled by the Soviet Union were worth approximately US$2 billion. Furthermore, the reparations conference for Japan will be held in the United States, and all resolutions of the reparations conference in the future will still need to be endorsed by the Far Eastern Commission.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Issues Report Describing Korean Developments</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd Dispatch] General MacArthur recently issued a report on the developments of the US military government in Korea, stating that as a result of the breakdown of US-Soviet negotiations, "the continued existence of the US military government is increasingly needed." Since the breakdown of negotiations, there has been public discussion among civilians about the possibility of forming a separate provisional government in South Korea. Later, this discussion gradually subsided. The report continued, "The people of South Korea are very disappointed with the changes in the political situation, but they express gratitude for the United States' support for Korean independence." Subsequently, it listed the important developments in May: (1) The establishment of several new political groups. (2) The promulgation of a law prohibiting the sale of women. (3) The holding of the May Day celebration ceremony. (4) The continued improvement of police administration.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Paris, 4th Broadcast: According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Sobolov telephoned the Albanian government to notify it of the country's accession to the United Nations organization. It is reported that Albania has selected Chekov as its representative to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 3rd Dispatch] The Greek Ambassador to the United States and Representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Dytramis, recently met with a reporter from the New York Times and stated that the Greek government believes that Albania has no right to claim that it is a friendly and peaceful country, and therefore objects to Albania's request to join the United Nations organization.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] Portuguese Ambassador to the United States Bissi-Cherchi stated here today that Portugal's formal application to join the United Nations organization as a member state has been submitted to the acting Secretary-General of the United Nations organization, and Portugal is prepared to accept all the obligations of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<h3>United Nations General Assembly</h3>

<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 3rd Dispatch] It is expected that if the UNRRA decides to cease its activities in Europe by the end of this year, Poland in Europe will receive the most UNRRA supplies. UNRRA personnel stated that if Director LaGuardia insists that Europe should continue to receive relief next year, he will recommend that the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development lend money to the governments of various countries in lieu of in-kind relief. What should be studied here is whether the beneficiary countries should repay in cash or export goods.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 3rd Dispatch] UNRRA Director LaGuardia will arrive here by special plane with his wife, expected to arrive tomorrow morning. The Swiss government is prepared to welcome them.</p>
<h3>The United States Plans to Form a National Defense Guard Corps to Deal with Atomic Age Tactics; Atomic Warhead Rockets Are Already Being Manufactured</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] The US Army is currently planning the largest national defense guard corps in history to be ready at any time to deal with enemy airborne troops in the atomic age. Major General Mildenburg, Director of the National Defense Guard Bureau, recently revealed that this guard corps will include 682,114 officers and soldiers, which is 60,000 more than the originally announced figure. The Army Ordnance Department announced that it is manufacturing a type of rocket equipped with atomic warheads that can intercept enemy bomber formations.</p>
<h3>Anniversary of Victory Over Japan: The United States to Commemorate Solemnly</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] Americans will commemorate the first anniversary of Japan's surrender on August 14. That day has been declared by President Truman as Victory Remembrance Day, and the entire country should hold solemn commemorative ceremonies to commemorate the great sacrifices made by men and women across the country to achieve victory, so as not to forget. Truman implored all Americans to pray earnestly on this day, and with the inspiration of the heroic soldiers of the armed forces, to continue to strive to complete the mission of justice, freedom, peace, and international goodwill.</p>

He believes that by 1950, atomic-powered warships may appear in the world.</p>
<h3>US Federal Reserve Discusses Inflation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] The Federal Reserve Board discussed the issue of inflation in a special publication, acknowledging that the rise in prices in the United States is a clear sign of inflation, but denying that the "astronomical" inflation that occurred in continental Europe is likely to occur in the United States. The report stated: "We have no reason to fear that such inflation will occur in the United States, because this type of inflation is caused by excessive issuance of currency leading to budget deficits. "The sharp reduction in office expenses, the maintenance of high wartime tax rates, and the maintenance of low income tax deduction methods prove that the government has not lost the ability to control the financial situation, and there is absolutely no danger of having to increase currency."</p>
<h3>Paris Telegraph Workers: Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] The National Strike Committee announced tonight that after consultation with the Minister of Finance, the workers of the National Central Telephone and Telegraph Bureau have scheduled to resume work tomorrow, and the workers' demands have been accepted by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>In the Midst of a Long Congressional Recess in the United States: A Review of General Political Achievements; Wide Rifts with the President on Domestic Affairs</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd Special Dispatch] The 79th US Congress ended its session yesterday, and all members of Congress are resting today. Many government-deemed "necessary bills" remain to be resolved by the next Congress, such as the unification of the armed forces, compulsory military training, and labor control bills, which must be re-submitted in January next year and go through troublesome procedures such as committee review and debate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd Special Dispatch] Unless the President calls a special session, the 79th US Congress has become a historical relic. That Congress has a record of cooperating with two presidents (Roosevelt and Truman) on wartime issues, and of fierce conflicts with two presidents on major domestic issues. The New York Times summarized the achievements of that Congress, believing that it was very successful in dealing with the war and its international consequences, but after the end of the war, it seemed to lack a definite sense of purpose. From an international perspective, the newspaper believes that the most regrettable thing is that Congress failed to stipulate peacetime military training and the urgently needed unification of the armed forces, thereby weakening the military position of the United States. Political observers are equally disappointed that Congress failed to pass three administrative bills that would increase America's position in world power politics and maintain US defense. One of the three bills is to authorize the President to assist in training and equipping one million Chinese troops.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] The 79th US Congress, known as the "Victory Congress" of World War II, after experiencing 20 months of war and peace, finally announced its adjournment tonight, and spent its longest congressional recess in eight years. Before the new Congress reconvenes in January next year, members of Congress hope that the results of the November elections can indicate whether a majority of American voters agree with the achievements they have made in the past two years. During its session, Congress supported the government's international cooperation plan in the following areas: (1) Ratification of the 1944 Bretton Woods monetary agreement. (2) Approval of a loan of US$3.75 billion to Britain. (3) Allocating huge sums of money to UNRRA. (4) Implementing the United Nations Charter and cooperating with various countries to exchange agricultural, educational, and scientific information.</p>
<h3>An Assassin Who Planned to Murder Truman Was Apprehended</h3>
<p>He Is a Mental Patient</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 4th Broadcast: The US Secret Service revealed today that a person who claimed to want to assassinate President Truman has been apprehended and will be tried soon. There have been many such cases. The above-mentioned person is the most recently arrested. These people are all mentally disturbed. Officials were unable to state who this suspect was, and the report did not mention where the incident occurred. It is only known that this suspect has committed many crimes and has been treated in a mental hospital three times.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Restaurants Close: Overseas Chinese Restaurants Are Full</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd Special Dispatch] 16,000 Japanese restaurants have closed in opposition to price controls, so the business of approximately 3,000 restaurants opened by overseas Chinese here has doubled in the past three days. The closure of the cafeterias set up by the Japanese is obviously intended to force the Japanese government to reconsider its decision. A large number of people and urban workers in Tokyo rely on these cafeterias for their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Corpse: Still Missing</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 4th Dispatch] According to the Italian Ansa news agency, the Milan Police Department issued a communiqué stating that four perpetrators who recently stole Mussolini's body from a public cemetery have been arrested and confessed to the theft. However, others have moved the body to another unknown location. The leader of the corpse thieves, named Nahas, is a neo-fascist who has been apprehended for a long time. The remaining three perpetrators were arrested in the past few days.</p>
<h3>Southern Traitors Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, 3rd Dispatch] Cardinal Rabi, Cardinal Stoja, and Cardinal Kovacevic, who held important positions in the Serbian puppet government, have been sentenced to death by the military court here.</p>
<h3>Muslim Spiritual Leader Delivers Speech: Advocates Organizing a Central Common Peace Mechanism; Views Us as an Honorary Partner of the Anglo-American Federation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, 3rd Dispatch] The Muslim spiritual leader, Aga Khan, gave a speech here tonight, advocating that Britain and its dominions unite with the United States as a central mechanism for leading human cooperation. The people of Britain, the United States, and the dominions should not be regarded as foreigners, but as siblings. The paper guarantees of the United Nations organization, no matter how perfect, are like fortresses built on sand if there is no common peace policy, how can one expect them to last? If the world federation of Britain, America, Ireland, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand has a permanent common peace policy and is determined to stop aggression, other peaceful countries in the world will naturally flock to this powerful central organization. Muslim countries need not have any other foreign policy or ambition, but only need to join this central peace mechanism. France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Scandinavian countries will never be creators of aggression. China will be an honorary partner of the Anglo-American Federation. Germany, Italy, and Japan have learned their lesson and will be happy to participate. Furthermore, if India and the colonies of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal are merely plantations for so-called protectorates, they will eventually become a source of trouble or lead to misunderstandings between Britain and the United States. One-quarter of the world's population, occupying one-third of the world's richest land, cannot be permanently subjected to control, no matter how much sugar-coated lotus root slices are given. Political knowledge must be given to them so that they can become pillars of peace, not places of bloodshed. The first step is to establish a government that the people are satisfied with, and the profitable plantation-owning countries must also share their monopolistic commercial interests with the world. In such a world, surrounded by truly peace-loving countries, the Soviet Union must also feel satisfied. After World War I, countries recognized the many drawbacks of the lack of organization in the world, and the League of Nations was established. I represented India at the disarmament conference from 1931 to 1938. I personally had great hopes for the League of Nations, but the League of Nations was merely a name for maintaining peace, and had no power to maintain peace, so the Second World War occurred. All these things are in the past, but if we do not mend the fold after losing the sheep, history will surely repeat itself.</p>
<h3>The Former Residence of the Great American Writer Mark Twain (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— A dispatch from our special correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing, from Norcheng</p>
<p>[Airmail dispatch dated July 12th] On the morning of my fourth day in Kansas, I received a telegram from Mr. Entehe of the State Department's News Bureau, essentially saying that the Tennessee Valley Authority had been contacted and I should proceed there immediately. My original plan to continue westward to the Rocky Mountains had to be temporarily abandoned, so that afternoon, I turned eastward. On the way back east, I stopped for a night in Hanniba, a small city of 10,000 people on the banks of the Mississippi River. Across the river is Illinois, while Hanniba itself belongs to Missouri. The city has many large hotels, specifically for accommodating tourists. Why do tourists come? Because it is the hometown of the great 19th-century American writer Mark Twain. Twain (Mark is his first name) was born in Hanniba in 1835. At that time, American civilization was still in its early stages. In the mid-19th century, the United States was on the path of industrialization, producing many famous scientists and inventors. However, in literature, the United States had always been dependent on Europe, with few outstanding talents. Mark Twain was almost a "unique" product. In Hanniba, I paid my respects to Twain's wooden cottage, where he had enjoyed his childhood and later years. The cottage is made of simple wooden planks and still retains its original appearance. To the left of the house is a garden facing the street, with lawns and plaster statues, said to be the place where Twain "conceived" his ideas. The cottage is a two-story building. Downstairs are the guest room and kitchen, displaying old-fashioned Mobil kerosene lamps, candles, and the teapot Twain used when writing. The kitchen has a very old-fashioned coal stove, and many Chinese and Western porcelain items. Upstairs is the bedroom, with antique sofas and clothes hanging on the clothes rack. Twain celebrated his 70th birthday in Hanniba on December 5, 1905, a famous event. He died in 1910. Later, the cottage was bought by George Mahan. In May 1912, the Mahans decided to donate it to the city government of Hanniba to commemorate the great writer. To the right of the cottage is the Hanniba Municipal Museum, which mostly displays Twain's works, manuscripts, and letters.</p>
<p>Twain's famous play "Joan of Arc" was written upstairs in a grocery store not far from his home. What was this grocery store used for in those days? A monument to Twain's creative work stands in front of the store. Mark Twain's most famous work, "Tom Sawyer," tells a story of an innocent childhood and its romance. Becky Thatcher, Tom's first love in the book, refers to a girl who lived across from Twain's house. This charming young girl from a century ago did not leave any traces in history. Today, the Thatcher family's wooden house still exists. Smart businessmen have converted it into a "Traveler's Lodge," specifically to attract Americans with a fondness for antiquity to spend a nostalgic night there. In China, Mark Twain's works may not be widely introduced. However, in Europe and the United States, some people call him the American Shakespeare. Sixteen years after Twain's death, American radio began broadcasting his works. Twain's plays were staged in New York, and The New York Times devoted an entire page to introduce them. The Hanniba Museum displays every publication and manuscript related to Mark Twain. There is a book chronicling Twain's life called "Son of Missouri—Mark Twain." There is also a book written by the Frenchman Wito, titled "Mark Twain's America." Hanniba is a small city, and shops, hotels, restaurants, and theaters all use Mark Twain's name to attract tourists. The city has parks, and there are musical performances on summer nights.</p>
<p>The life of residents in small American cities is very interesting. They know how to arrange a "human" life. As I strolled down the street, many people looked at me with curiosity. I knew that many Americans in small cities had never seen a person of color before. On the morning of my departure from Hanniba, I took a walk in "Wangjiang Park" by the Mississippi River. There is a bronze statue of Mark Twain there, like a giant, towering above the torrents of the Mississippi. Twenty miles north across the river from Hanniba is a medium-sized city in Illinois called "Quincy." I quickly toured the streets of Quincy for a week, but I didn't have time to stay. Consul Shen Zuogan told me a story about Quincy: There was a overseas Chinese man named Huang Sanmei who had been doing business in the United States for a long time and had accumulated some wealth. This gentleman liked to express his opinions on national affairs. After the start of the War of Resistance, he offered a reward of three thousand US dollars to the first hero to bomb Tokyo. Later, when General Doolittle bombed Tokyo, he indeed wired three thousand dollars to Mrs. Doolittle.</p>
<p>Mrs. Doolittle</p>
<p>returned it intact, saying, "Soldiers are performing their duties for the country and cannot accept any private rewards." Huang Sanmei was in a dilemma, and finally came up with a solution: he bought a Chinese antique vase and sent it to the Doolittle's home. That was one incident. The second story is: On one occasion, Huang Sanmei suddenly had a "whim" and wrote to the Chinese government, suggesting that students be sent to the United States to study a certain science, with all tuition fees borne by him. It is said that the education authorities actually believed this and specially selected four students to come to the United States. As soon as the students arrived, Huang Sanmei suddenly changed his mind, claiming that he was "unwilling to pay this expense," causing the embassy and consulates great difficulty. The total cost of the four students studying for three years was about ten thousand US dollars. The embassy asked people in many ways for the reason, but he ignored it and instead asked a foreigner to reply to the embassy, saying that the Chinese government was "undemocratic" and that he was unwilling to bear the cost. The embassy had asked him to respond to why he wrote letters irresponsibly in the first place? Later, other overseas Chinese came out to dissuade them, saying, "Huang is simply a madman, why pursue it any further?" What was the outcome of this strange case? It is not yet known. Has the money been settled? I also don't have time to investigate. I passed through Quincy that day. Because of the urgency, I did not visit this strange overseas Chinese man, Mr. Huang Sanmei. It was midnight when I arrived in Chicago. I did not delay and took the train south the next day. The train passed through the large city of Bender in Indiana and the capital of Indiana, "Indianapolis." This road is all an endless plain. Geologists call the states of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio in the Midwestern United States the "Black Soil Region," meaning that those states are the most affluent and suitable for farming. I changed trains in Cincinnati, a large city at the junction of the three states. South of Cincinnati is what Americans call the "South." The railway company is also called the "Southern Railway Company." The trains of the Southern Railway Company are the same as those in the North. The only big difference is that blacks and whites are seated separately. When entering the station, the station police check tickets and wave their hands, saying "left door" or "right door." This is where the oddity lies. I was assigned to enter through the right door, but I didn't think about the black and white distinction. Seeing that the train behind was crowded, I tried to run to the front. Just as I was about to step onto the train in front, I opened my eyes and saw that it was full of blacks. Knowing it was not good, I ran back to board the train behind. The white "conductor" on the train smiled at me. I remember listening to a friend who had lived in Louisiana (the South) for a long time telling a story in New York. The second day he went to the South, he saw that the toilets were divided into black and white. He thought that the Chinese were yellow, which side should he go into? After thinking for a long time, he stepped forward and asked a policeman. The policeman pointed his baton at the white toilet and said, "Of course, here!" Wang Wenjue, the chief writer of the Chicago Sanmin Morning Post, told me another similar story. Once, he went to the South. After the train passed a certain station, he saw that the whites were all leaving their seats. He thought they had reached their destination and got off the train. Therefore, he didn't mind. After a while, all the whites had left. Black men and women, supporting the old and leading the young, were getting more and more crowded. A train staff member walked up to him, leaned in and whispered, "Please move to the rear train." Because Wang had a lot of luggage, moving was troublesome, and because the Chinese were not used to those racial prejudices, he remained in his original seat. After a long time, the entire train was full of blacks. The shouting of black children gradually became noisy, and they even defecated and urinated on the seats in the car. Only then did he feel the stench and filth unbearable, not a human world, and he had no choice but to move to the rear train. The staff member on the train smiled and told him, "I told you a long time ago, didn't I?"</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At 3 PM on the 31st of last month, a woman named Zhu Zhou reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station that her husband, Zhu Zhendao, had been tricked out by bandits posing as painters at 8:30 AM the previous day, never to return (on the previous day, Zhu received a phone call from an unknown person, saying that there was a house that needed painting, and they would come to discuss it on the morning of the 30th. When the time came, someone did come and he was tricked and kidnapped). At dusk, a person named Bao Shangqian came to Mrs. Zhu, claiming that Zhu Zhendao had been kidnapped by bandits, and a ransom of 20 million yuan was required, otherwise he would be killed. He hoped that she would find a way, and agreed to come again the next afternoon to discuss it. Mrs. Zhu asked Yu Fengxiang to negotiate a reduction in the ransom with the bandits, while Su led police officer Zhu Jian and police chief Huang Yulin and others to disguise themselves and wait near Zhu Zhendao's home (No. 1, Lane 1703, Beijing West Road). At about 9:40 PM that night, Bao Shangqian did come to negotiate, and he was arrested and taken to the station for interrogation. According to his confession, the case was orchestrated by Ren Qilang (the kidnapped person's apprentice, who had left the shop several years ago), who colluded with other bandits to kidnap him. Ren Qilang has now reduced the ransom to 6 million yuan, and agreed to meet at 5 AM on August 1 at the Jingxiu Nunnery in Yangjing, Pudong, to deliver the ransom. At midnight that night, the police disguised themselves and crossed the river to Pudong, waiting near the port. At about 6 AM the next morning, Ren Qilang did arrive as agreed, and he was captured and taken back to the branch office. According to his confession, the kidnapped person was tricked into going to Dashengchang Wharf in Yangshupu by his accomplices on the 30th under the pretext of painting the house, and hired a small boat to Chongming Xianghua Township Liuyi to hide him, but the exact address was unknown. It was agreed that after obtaining the ransom, they would go there to find him. Another accomplice, Yang Longqi, agreed to meet at the Bund Park at 12 noon on the 1st, and then go to Chongming together. The police officers took the arrested Ren to the Bund Park to wait at the appointed time. Before long, Yang Longqi came slowly and was immediately arrested. After individual interrogation, it was learned that the hostage was indeed hidden in Liuyi, Chongming. In order to quickly rescue the hostage, the police bureau immediately dispatched plainclothes police officer Zhu Jian overnight, leading police chief Huang Yulin and plainclothes police officers Zhao Yiqian, Zhao Jiren, Liu Shiyang, Yang Zhongmin, and Wang Huimin, along with an arrested bandit, to hire a boat to Baocheng Town, Chongming. Chen Hongxiang, who was watching the ticket on the boat, was arrested in the town. According to his confession, the hostage was hidden in Liuyi, but he did not know which house. They then hired a car to rush to Liuyi, which was a very remote place, bordering the Yangtze River to the south, with many diverging ports. The police officers and the local Baojia chiefs searched door to door. At 3 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, they searched a thatched cottage in the west beach of Liuyi and rescued the hostage. The bandit Chen Hongxiang and the hostage Zhu Zhendao were taken back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yang Wendao Case: Defense Lawyer Expresses Optimism; Wu Tiecheng Recently Sent a Letter of Comfort to Yang</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to Tang Huai, Yang Wendao's defense lawyer, he believes that the outcome of Yang Wendao's case being remanded for retrial is extremely promising, and he firmly believes that the miscarriage of justice can be redressed, or even concluded in one court session. On the 23rd of last month, he submitted a defense petition to the High Court, stating: (1) A key piece of evidence in the case, a "physics textbook," was originally in English, but suddenly became Chinese. The book was hollowed out and used to hide a handgun. Therefore, "the book is used to prove the origin of the gun, but since the book does not match, the gun loses its attachment." (2) The original judgment's adoption of the confessions and performances of the co-defendant Ye Haisheng did not correspond to the true facts. "His confession was obtained through torture, and his performance was directed by the police." He also emphasized, "Recalling the time, the relationship between China and Japan was precarious, and the authorities in the concession felt a high degree of unease in spirit. Therefore, the police investigation became even more intensified, not hesitating to create a miscarriage of justice. For ten years, both spirit and body have suffered, and the material losses are incalculable."</p>
<p>Recently, the court subpoenaed eleven witnesses to be questioned, including: (1) Guo Qiming, the lawyer hired by the Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Association on behalf of Yang ten years ago; (2) Zhang Zhirang, the lawyer appointed by the court as Yang's pro bono defense lawyer at the time; (3) Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer at the time; (4) Wei Ligong, the forensic doctor; (5) Li Mu, who lent the self-defense handgun to Yang Wendao; (6) Yang Jianzhong, Yang Wendao's cousin, who first reported Yang Wendao to the Japanese investigator as the perpetrator of the case; (7) Zhang Chen, a witness favorable to Yang Wendao, but it is said that he was arrested and killed by the Japanese military police during the Shanghai occupation; (8) Zeng Yuan, also known as Zeng Yuanjia, who reported to the Japanese with Yang Jianzhong; (9) Zheng Weimin, who claimed to be a Japanese named Hirayama Genichi, who insisted that Yang was the murderer, but it is said that he was shot by the authorities in Guangzhou when it was about to fall several years ago for acting as a traitor; (10) Clauso, a Western detective; (11) Chen Rongsheng, Yang Wendao's servant, who is not currently in Shanghai. According to Yang's family, Tan Zhen, who led the plainclothes Japanese police to arrest Yang Wendao, was not subpoenaed by the High Court, presumably an oversight. It is said that Wu Tiecheng recently sent a letter to Yang Wendao, expressing his comfort, because when the case occurred, Wu was the mayor of Shanghai. The Japanese wanted to create an incident and tortured Yang Wendao to falsely accuse Wu of masterminding it, but Yang never yielded.</p>

<h3>Personnel Administration Society, Shanghai Branch Recruiting Members</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Personnel Administration Society, after active preparations by the Personnel Department of the Municipal Government and the Personnel Offices of various agencies such as the Works Bureau of the Municipal Party Headquarters, is about to be formally established. The second preparatory meeting of the association was held at the Personnel Department of the Municipal Government at 4 PM on the 3rd, and it was decided to begin recruiting members immediately, and then formally establish the association on a fixed date.

<h3>Issue of Returning Captured Yarn and Cloth: Trade Associations Appeal to Investigation Team</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] This reporter recently interviewed the persons in charge of the Dyeing and Weaving, Cotton Yarn, and Cotton Cloth Trade Associations to inquire about the issue of returning captured yarn and cloth. According to them, when the investigation team for the takeover work first came to Shanghai, the three associations jointly submitted a document requesting the investigation and return of the surplus amount of yarn and cloth forcibly bought and sold by the enemy and puppets. When the investigation team invited the various industries for talks last week, the three industries again sent representatives to make statements in person, and prepared a document to provide information, suggesting that the investigation team review the minutes of previous meetings of the Enemy Property Handling Review Committee and investigate the handling of the captured yarn and cloth in detail, including how much was sold and how much was extracted from the victimized factories (because the puppet Merchant's Association did not extract and deposit it in the original factories). More than eight out of ten of the 4,500 victimized factories entrusted the associations to strive for the return of the yarn and cloth from the government after the victory. The victimized businesses now hold fixed-term deposit certificates from the puppet Central Reserve Bank issued after the forced purchase and sale by the puppet Merchant's Association. Until the victory, one-quarter of the price had not yet been paid. According to the association's investigation, the amount of captured yarn and cloth is 2 million bolts of cloth and more than 10,000 bales of yarn, which happens to be one-quarter of the total amount purchased and sold. If valued at the current market price, it should be more than 160 trillion yuan. If handled according to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau's method, each bolt of cloth would only need to be issued 4 jiao 6 fen 8 li in legal currency, because it is based on the price set by the enemy and puppets at the time of the forced purchase and sale, converted from puppet currency at a ratio of 200 to 1. If issued according to this number, it would be almost ridiculous. Therefore, businesses are vehemently opposed to this method. After the investigation team arrived in Shanghai, the principals who entrusted the associations urged the associations to argue their case according to reason in order to obtain the return of the yarn and cloth, but it is said that the associations do not insist on the estimated value of 160 billion yuan. It is also understood that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, and representatives from various industries will organize a petitioning delegation to Nanjing. The three associations also plan to send representatives to Nanjing to appeal to the highest authorities.</p>
<h3>Charity Sale at Bathhouses Raises Nearly 20 Million</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Subei Refugee Relief Association held its second preparatory meeting at the association yesterday afternoon at 4 PM to elect "Miss Shanghai" and the "Queens" of each group to help disaster relief. (1) The association's Chairman Du and Vice Chairman Wu will personally participate in the garden party to elect "Miss Shanghai," and Dr. Mei Lanfang will be invited to present the awards. (2) The number of admission tickets is limited to one thousand. In the past few days, they were entrusted to major companies, dance halls, and theaters for sale. Award winners and persons in charge of various associations and reporters will be admitted with invitations, and the military and police will be asked to send personnel to assist. (4) The date of the election and garden party was decided to be postponed for five days to the 20th of this month at the New Xianlin. In addition, the chairman of the Dance Hall Industry Association, Sun Hongyuan, has strictly investigated the incident of Fei Yueshi, the dance hall manager, embezzling the 80,000 yuan earned by the dancer Li Zhenzhen, and found that it was not true. The manager also stated that if it is found to be true, he is willing to be subject to criminal punishment. The fundraising committee has sent members to conduct a new and thorough investigation, and the truth will be revealed soon. As of last night, the association had received a total of more than 19.9 million yuan in donations from the city-wide charity sale at bathhouses.</p>

<h3>Industrial and Commercial Leaders Save the Crisis·First Establish a Group Meeting·Responsible for Organizing Proposals·Today's Decision to go to Nanjing for Petition</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] During the occupation, Shanghai's industry and commerce suffered various forms of exploitation from the enemy and puppets, resulting in significant losses. After the victory, labor strikes arose one after another. Recently, the unrestricted import of American goods has dealt a fatal blow to domestic manufacturers, creating a serious crisis. To save this crisis, industry and commerce leaders in the city, initiated by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, and various trade associations, have formed a Nanjing petition delegation. After repeated meetings, yesterday at 4:00 PM, the directors and supervisors of the Industrial Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Wu Yun-chu, [blank] Yi-cheng, and Jin Run-xiang served as the presidium. To gather collective wisdom, it was decided to first organize a subcommittee to be responsible for organizing proposals and scheduling the petition. Wu Yun-chu, Xu Ji-[blank], Luo Qing-hua, Jin Run-xiang, Shou Jing-wei, Tao Gui-lin, Yang Guan-bei, Pan Shi-hao, Xu Xue-yu, Yu Ming-yu, Ge Jie-cheng, Tian He-qing, Cai Xin-tao, Xu Xiao-chu, Zhu Shang-yi, and Hu Bo-xiang were appointed as members of the committee, with the secretaries of the Industrial Association and the Chamber of Commerce assisting in the work.

(2) Expedite production loans to rescue the financial crisis. (3) Implement an import and export marketing system and subsidize exports, or implement high-priced purchases, to adjust foreign trade. (4) Organize a revival of industrial investment companies, etc., to promote international economic cooperation.

<h3>Taking the Exam is Difficult·More Difficult than Ascending to Heaven·Limited Quota, Unprecedented Crowd·Students Full of Schooling Panic</h3>
<p>Taking the exam is difficult, more difficult than ascending to heaven!</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, swarms of students graduate from middle school and enter universities batch by batch. Although taking the university entrance exam is not easy, the chance of being "rejected" is, after all, a minority for students who are above the standard! However, this year is different. Schools are experiencing a general panic, and every school has the problem of being overcrowded. Especially those national universities that are recruiting in Shanghai, they have limited quotas, and the number of students who register for the exam often exceeds a thousand or a hundred times. This unprecedented congestion has made students shocked and panicked! They are all shouting: Taking the exam is difficult, more difficult than ascending to heaven!</p>
<p>The Floor is Trampled Through, the Doors and Windows are Broken·Registration is Swarming Like an Assault</p>
<p>The national universities recruiting in Shanghai this year include Yenching University, the Associated Universities (Tsinghua, Nankai, Peking University), Xiamen University, and the National College of Social Education. The enthusiasm of the applicants exceeded everyone's expectations. Among them, the earliest to recruit was Yenching University, and the registration location was at McTyeire School. McTyeire School has always been famous for its magnificent architecture on the sea, but on the first day of Yenching University's registration, the floor of the office was trampled through! The situation at the Associated Universities was even more tense. On the first day of registration, students were waiting at the gate of Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road as early as 6:00 AM. As soon as the gate opened, they swarmed forward, and the doors and windows were knocked down. The organizers were caught off guard and unable to cope, so they temporarily changed the method and first issued numbered registration certificates. Registration was then carried out in stages based on the order of the numbers on the certificates. At the same time, in order to maintain order on that day, they queued up in order to receive the certificates. That day, there was a line like a long snake formation, which was absolutely no different from the past when competing to buy rationed rice. Students stood for a long time, only to get a registration certificate. They had to wait until the designated day to register again, but the date and location of the exam still had to wait for the school's notification, because there were too many people registering. In addition to deciding to hold the "Associated Universities" in three sessions, it was also necessary to find examination rooms that could accommodate these students, but it has not been found to this day. The students' mood is contradictory. They are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the exam date, but they are also afraid that there is not much difference between taking the exam and not taking it, because the hope of being admitted is too small. The maximum capacity for new students at "Associated Universities" this semester is 2,000, but the number of people who have registered for the exam has reached 20,000. Calculating the ratio, it is no wonder that the students are panicking.</p>
<p>Low Tuition Fees Promote National Universities·Impoverished Students Call it a Savior</p>
<p>This crowded phenomenon is even more pronounced in national universities, which was expected, because national universities have a good reputation and low tuition fees. For example, Fudan University, etc., only charges 500 yuan for tuition, plus all kinds of miscellaneous fees, which is only 2,000 yuan. For general impoverished students, it is regarded as the only savior. At the same time, national universities all have their own specialties, so they are even more desired by students who are devoted to learning. Usually, those who study journalism compete to take the Yenching University exam, those who study engineering compete to take the Tsinghua University exam, and those who study law compete to take the Peking University exam... But the problem is that general private universities in Shanghai are no exception. This semester, the average number of applicants for each school has tripled compared to the past. For example, about 1,200 people took the first entrance exam for Shanghai University, and 200 were admitted. Because there were many students taking the exam for St. John's University, the admission standards were very strict. It is said that the students who took the exam from several famous middle schools were almost all eliminated this time.</p>
<p>There is More Gruel Than Monks, What Can We Do·Familiar Faces Everywhere in the Exam Room</p>
<p>The main reason for this unreasonable phenomenon is naturally due to the fact that students are concentrated on the Beijing-Shanghai line amidst the restoration. But another major reason is that students repeatedly apply to various schools. Because they saw that there were so many applicants, the students were greatly panicked, so they had to try their luck at various schools with a fluke mentality. According to reporters, a large number of students are preparing to rush to Nanjing to take the Central University and Jinling University exams. So the result is that they keep bumping into each other, and they are all these familiar faces! The consequence of this fact is that the students admitted to each school are also duplicates, because students with excellent grades have more opportunities to be admitted. So where will the remaining majority of students with relatively poor grades go?</p>
<p>Now, the enrollment of various schools is still just the beginning. Except for Yenching University, which has already taken the exam, the other schools recruiting in Shanghai have not yet decided on the date and location of the exam. After the exam, this huge number of exam papers will be transported to the original school site, and the professors will grade them separately. The day of the announcement is really far away! Where is the destination of these students wandering on the crossroads?</p>
<p>The enrollment exam this year is "unprecedented", but I hope it is also "unmatched"!</p>

<h3>Building 10,000 Houses·Needs 100 Billion in Funding</h3>
<p>In order to solve the housing shortage in the city, the Municipal Housing Rental Management Committee has recently prepared huge sums of money from the city's banking sector to build new houses. According to the person in charge of the association, in an interview with a reporter from China News Agency: According to the city's population, in order to thoroughly solve the housing shortage, it is necessary to add 100,000 buildings. However, due to the limited funds, it is impossible to build in large quantities. The association currently plans to build 10,000 houses on vacant land or public land in the city. If each building is calculated at 10 million yuan, a total of 100 billion yuan is needed. It is not yet known whether the city's banking sector can undertake this amount. They are currently continuing to discuss loans, and the situation is quite optimistic. As for renting out the houses to citizens after they are built, whether to adopt installment payments or a one-time payment is under study.</p>
<h3>Repatriated Laborers·Merged for Relief</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Repatriated Laborers Takeover Committee was approved by General Commander He last year upon the suggestion of General MacArthur to transport 30,000 Chinese laborers repatriated within two months, 10,000 of whom landed in Shanghai. Therefore, the organization for accommodation and management could not be too small. In addition to the relevant authorities jointly organizing the committee, it established four groups: General Affairs, Control, Supply, and Hygiene. All personnel, in addition to those who were transferred, currently have more than 40 full-time employees. However, the number of repatriated laborers accommodated since its establishment has never exceeded 240 at most. The number of those still staying in the association, together with the recently newly received laborers, totals less than 80. In comparison, it is obvious that the organization needs to be streamlined. The Social Affairs Bureau originally had a Unemployed Workers Relief Committee, with a new address near the Dagong Yarn Factory on Pingliang Road, which is not far from the current address of the association and can be merged. This proposal has been passed by the last municipal meeting and will be handed over starting today.</p>
<h3>Xieqiao Plague Hospital·Invite Visits from All Walks of Life</h3>

After half a month of active preparations, it has been completed. It started admitting patients on the 1st of this month. There is no charge for outpatient and inpatient services, so the number of patients seeking treatment is quite crowded. The hospital also invited people from all walks of life in the city to visit yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Medical Association Established·Electing Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Medical Association, prepared and organized by Tu Qihua and others, has been completed and filed with the relevant authorities. Yesterday, it held its inaugural meeting at the New Life Club, attended by more than 100 famous local doctors. The meeting was first opened by Tu Qihua, the temporary chairman elected by the association, who delivered an opening speech. Then, representatives from the competent authorities and the Physicians Association of the Chinese Medical Association delivered speeches separately. The meeting approved the association's charter and temporary proposals. Song Daren and others proposed holding academic lectures and symposiums to facilitate research, communicate opinions, report on association affairs, and publish association journals, among other proposals. It was resolved that the directors and supervisors of the association would prepare to hold these events. Tu Qihua, Feng Zhiyin, Zhan Keming, Yao Juyan, Zhang Boren, Ni [blank] Hua, Yang Lianghong, Sun Jianmin, and Hu Zhitong were elected as directors. Wang Yanzhi, Shi Liangyuan, Jin Baiping, and Huang Kefang were elected as alternate directors. Zhu Shanji, Diao Bingchu, and Ye [blank] Bo were elected as supervisors.

<h3>Banning Rickshaws and Tricycles·Considering the Problem of Drivers Changing Careers</h3>
<p>The city is crowded with vehicles and horses, and the streets are blocked, making transportation extremely difficult. In order to improve transportation, the municipal authorities have planned to widen the area of ​​main streets and demolish protruding houses that hinder traffic. They also plan to ban rickshaws and tricycles, which are the most difficult to manage and have the largest number. However, because this matter is of great importance, once implemented, tens of thousands of drivers will suffer unemployment. To take care of this situation, the authorities have postponed the implementation period of the ban and are discussing it at length, considering issues such as drivers changing careers or being granted other job skills, in order to reduce the important post-disaster problems such as unemployment panic. According to Director Zhao of the Bureau of Public Utilities, the authorities strive for perfection in every policy they implement. The proposal to ban rickshaws and tricycles is still under precise study and will not be implemented in a short period of time.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Migration to Hong Kong·Chinese Businessmen Not Likely to Make Such Plans·Interview with Ouyang Lun, Director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs</h3>
<p>Ouyang Lun, Director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. Yesterday, a reporter asked him how to solve the current difficulties in the industrial sector. He said: The Ministry has held a meeting to discuss this matter and has decided on several important principles, which are currently being consulted with relevant authorities for reference and implementation. Regarding the import and export trade, the Ministry is currently discussing improvements with the Ministry of Finance. Regarding the rumors that Shanghai's industry and commerce are trending towards migration to Hong Kong, the reporter asked if the Ministry of Economic Affairs has made appropriate considerations. He said: Minister Wang is also paying close attention to this matter. However, based on my observation, foreign-funded enterprises may have this change, but because it is not easy for domestic industrial circles to migrate funds and equipment, they are unlikely to make such plans in fact. The reporter then asked if there are preferential measures for private factories in the rear when bidding for enemy and puppet factories. He said: The bidding for enemy and puppet factories is handled by the Enemy and Puppet Property Bureau. As for whether there are preferential measures for private factories in the rear, I have not heard of them yet because I have been busy these days. Finally, the reporter asked whether the government will continue to handle industrial loans and orders for private factories and mines. He said: The Ministry of Economic Affairs is discussing with the Joint Office on how to continue to organize industrial loans. As for ordering from private factories and mines, it was organized in the rear during the war. After Japan surrendered, it was impossible to continue due to the lack of government budget and limited financial resources.</p>

<h3>Teacher's Desperate Suicide; Hongshun Mutual Aid Society Re-established; Tangkou Decorated with Red Silk and Lion Dance Celebrations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Hongshun Mutual Aid Society of this city was established in April of the 19th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1930]. It is one of the charitable welfare organizations of the Hongmen, founded by Yang Wendao. In those years, it enjoyed considerable prestige and attracted the attention of the Japanese invaders. The Yang Wendao case was implicated; it was not unrelated to his chairmanship of this society. During the war, the society suffered from military disturbances, and its headquarters were completely destroyed. Furthermore, due to Yang's arrest, the society's affairs were suspended. Yesterday afternoon, a re-establishment meeting was specifically held at the Guangzhao Public School on North Sichuan Road. Approximately a thousand people attended, including Yang Wendao, Liao Zengxun, Situ Meitang, Zhu Jiazhao, and both old and new members, most of whom were Cantonese. The entrance hall of the meeting place was decorated with red silk, and it was filled with gifts such as flower baskets, silver tripods, horizontal scrolls, and vertical banners donated by various Hongmen groups. Outside the entrance, lion dances and martial arts were performed under the scorching sun to express celebration. The atmosphere was particularly enthusiastic. The Bureau of Social Affairs sent Jin Dongli to the site for guidance. Mr. Jin mentioned that he was also a member of the society and delivered a speech in which he praised the Hongmen spirit. Subsequently, Situ Meitang, Feng Shaoshan, and others gave speeches. Tea and refreshments were served after the meeting, and entertainment was provided. Although there were many people, the order was quite good.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a young man committed suicide at the Xin Hengchang Hotel, No. 661 Zhejiang Road. The incident occurred on the 3rd at 4:00 PM when a young man wearing Hong Kong-style shirt and trousers checked into Room 10. He left the name Hang Jianqiu, from Yixing, 28 years old, a police academy graduate visiting friends in Shanghai, etc., in the hotel register. Shortly thereafter, he closed the door and went to sleep. Until 11:30 AM yesterday, a tea server, Ni Dahe, noticed that the guest had not yet gotten up. He opened the door and entered, finding Hang Jianqiu lying on his side on the bed, unconscious and unresponsive. There was a bottle of sedative pills on the table, indicating that the guest had taken poison. He urgently summoned an ambulance, which rushed the man to the Gongji Hospital. Due to severe poisoning, he remained unconscious last night. Upon further investigation of Room 10, which Hang had opened, there was a letter of appointment from the National School of Yixing County, two pawn tickets, and over 50 legal tender. It is believed that the cause of his suicide was likely that he was unable to find his friends, had reached a dead end, and resorted to this desperate measure.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hefei dispatch] A few days before the semester exams at the Anhui Provincial Bengbu Vocational School of Technology, students stirred up unrest by claiming to be auditing the school's accounts and uncovering embezzlement by the president.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang dispatch] After the victory, the textbooks used in primary schools in various places were in short supply, which became a serious problem during the winter vacation. The Jiangsu Department of Education is deeply concerned that this serious phenomenon will repeat itself after the summer vacation.

As for the textbooks for subjects above junior high school that do not have national versions, schools are temporarily allowed to freely adopt the approved versions of various bookstores. The main points of the department's national textbook supply measures are listed below: (1) For the national textbooks for the autumn semester of this year, except for provincial high schools that can negotiate their own purchases, all national textbooks for the four subjects (civics, Chinese, history, and geography) of public and private secondary schools in each county (city), as well as all national textbooks for primary schools, will be strictly surveyed and statistically accounted for by the education department of each county (city) government, and the quantity of textbooks used by each grade in each school.

<h3>Spectators Disrupt Jiaozhou Park; Mini-Soccer Game Ends in Disappointment; Han Longhai Misunderstands with Soviet Player</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper dispatch] The mini-soccer first-division league held games at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon. In the first game of the first group, Soviet A defeated the Lei team with a score of 2-0. In the second game of the second group, Soviet B played against the Railway A team. When the Railway team was ahead with a score of 1-0, Han Longhai suddenly had a misunderstanding with the Soviet B team's Brown. First, he struck Brown in the face with his hand. The Soviet B team's goalkeeper, Usvatov, also stepped forward to help retaliate, causing a portion of the audience to pour into the field and surround the Soviet players. As a result, the game could not continue. It is estimated that four or five Soviet players were injured, making it the second unfortunate incident in the mini-soccer world this season. (The first was the game between Xingdong and Xilian). The cause of the misunderstanding was the referee's weakness. When both sides were 0-0, both were eager to win, and both sides took rude actions. However, the referee turned a blind eye, resulting in an increasingly rude performance. Han Longhai made the first mistake, and the referee remained completely still, causing the audience to riot unreasonably. Fortunately, the mini-soccer association and the Jiaozhou Park management were effective in managing the situation, and the situation was quelled.</p>

<p>Civil Administration Briefs</p>
<h3>Government and Education Personnel Purchasing Goods Should Obtain Stamp Tax Receipts; The Municipal Government, After Receiving Orders, Relayed Them to Various Agencies for Compliance</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government recently received an order from the Executive Yuan, citing a report from the Ministry of Finance stating that commercial invoices, receipts for money and goods, and bills are the main sources of stamp tax revenue. All manufacturers should issue invoices for sold goods and affix stamp tax stamps in accordance with the law. However, in reality, many manufacturers evade taxes by not issuing receipts for goods sold, money received, or services provided by hotels and restaurants, and those who receive receipts also do not have the habit of requesting receipts to urge stamping. This has resulted in significant losses in stamp tax revenue. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan issue separate orders to all military, government, and educational personnel nationwide to take the lead in advocating and establishing a trend. When purchasing goods or paying money, they must request invoices, receipts, and bills, and supervise the person issuing the document to affix stamps, in order to prevent tax evasion, etc. Based on this, it should be approved and implemented. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government relayed it to all subordinate agencies for compliance yesterday.</p>
<h3>Concentrated Efforts to Eliminate Opium and Other Drugs</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Interior yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Government, stating briefly that the Executive Yuan's post-cleanup measures for eliminating opium and other drugs list the elimination of opium and other drugs as an important central task for governments at all levels. The following key points are specifically listed: (1) The work of eliminating opium and other drugs should be raised to a higher level compared to other central tasks, and a percentage should be clearly defined. (2) Personnel and expenses should be appropriately allocated to the competent and assisting anti-drug agencies, and efforts should be made to concentrate their use. (3) Various administrative meetings and administrative inspections should focus on anti-drug efforts. (4) Administrative procedures should prioritize anti-drug efforts and strive to simplify them.</p>
<h3>Welfare for Military Dependents in the Fourteenth District</h3>
<p>Wang Yichi, the surviving family member of Wang Puzhen, a pilot in the Second Squadron of the First Wing of the Air Force, is from Funing, Jiangsu Province. Due to the banditry in northern Jiangsu, he fled to this city with his family of six and resided in a thatched house at No. 224 Old Civilian Village on Pu Pu Road in Zhabei. Living in a foreign land, they faced difficult circumstances and petitioned the Municipal Government for relief. The Municipal Government previously ordered the Fourteenth District Office to send personnel to express condolences and register them. It is now known that Xiao Zhenpei, the head of the thirteenth Bao, was dispatched by the district to investigate and register the address and provide preliminary condolences. Yesterday, he presented the difficult living situation of the surviving family member Wang Yichi to the Municipal Government, requesting that relief be provided in advance.</p>
<h3>Demobilized Military Party Workers</h3>
<p>The Provincial and Municipal Governments Should Give Priority to Hiring</p>
<p>The Municipal Government received an order from the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating that a letter from the Central Organization Department on June 17, 1946 (Jing Jing Jun No. 1379) stated that after the military party departments were abolished according to the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session, regarding the case of providing relief to demobilized military party workers, the third item of the implementation measures requests that the Executive Yuan instruct the provincial and municipal governments to give priority to finding ways to hire demobilized military party workers, and also instruct the political departments of the provincial security command headquarters to provide a list of names to be sent to the provincial and municipal governments for verification. In addition to sending separate letters from this association, we are hereby writing again to request verification and instruct the provincial and municipal governments to comply, and we hope to receive a reply. Based on this, it should be separately instructed to comply and instruct all subordinates to comply accordingly.</p>
<h3>Questions and Answers on Household Registration Laws and Regulations (Continued)</h3>
<p>(23) Question: If a son who remarries with his mother still uses his biological father's surname and returns to his original family after reaching adulthood, can he be listed as a family member?</p>
<p>Answer: Article 1078 of the Civil Code stipulates that "adopted children take the surname of the adopter," and the first paragraph of Article 1078 of the same law stipulates that "the adoption of children shall be in writing."

<h3>Reply to Mr. Guo Xiushi</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department recently replied to Mr. Guo Xiushi, saying: Regarding the inquiry as to whether a district chief can concurrently serve as a municipal councilor, Article 2 of the Municipal Councilor Election Regulations restricts elected civil servants to a narrow definition of civil servants. District chiefs are personnel who handle local self-government and are currently referred to as public officials, not civil servants, so there are no restrictions during elections. After being elected, it does not hinder the exercise of their original powers, and the Executive Yuan's interpretation allows them to hold concurrent positions.</p>
<h3>40,000 Children in Tianjin Out of School; 3,800 Middle School Students Out of School</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Tianjin on the 4th] The problem of children out of school in Tianjin is serious. During the summer vacation, more than 100 elementary schools enrolled students, with each school enrolling only 50 to 100 students, while each had about 500 applicants. As a result, 40,000 children will have no school to attend. The admission rate for middle schools is even lower. Tianjin Provincial Middle School alone had 4,000 applicants, and only 200 were admitted. The remaining 3,800 were rejected and left without direction.</p>

<h3>Causes and Consequences of the Oil Crisis: No Special Stimulus, No Supply and Demand Problems; Oil Merchants Request Improvement in Allocation Methods</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Edible oil is one of the main daily necessities. Recently, the imbalance between supply and demand has caused quite a stir. Fortunately, with the proper handling by all parties concerned, the situation is gradually easing. According to the reporter's investigation, the edible oil problem in this city will become clearer in the future. Its price may become more reasonable with the increase in supply.</p>
<p>Those in the know believe that the recent edible oil crisis was not accidental. The reasons are: (1) Depleted inventory: Since March of this year, oil prices have remained stable. General囤戶 (people who hoard goods) have been gradually selling to edible oil retail stores due to the unbearable burden of暗息 (interest on underground loans). (2) Traffic obstruction: Qingdao, Dalian, and northern Jiangsu were originally major suppliers of edible oil to this city. Now, due to local unrest, the normal supply volume has been affected, and the sources are intermittent. (3) Actual sales are still brisk: Retail customers in this city are buying actively, and gangs from Guangdong and Yong also come to purchase from time to time. (4) The output of various factories in this city has not returned to normal. Statistics show that the total output of seven private oil factories has been reduced by half compared to before the war. (5) The immediate cause was that when oil prices were gradually rising at the end of last month, the China Vegetable Oil Factory allocated edible oil to the market, but the quantity was limited, and those applying for allocation came in droves. In this situation of too many monks and too little porridge, the original allocation method was temporarily canceled once.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the market at the end of last month was stimulated by this immediate cause, which caused the accumulated problems of edible oil to erupt. As a result, the oil market was unable to trade because of the authorities' price suppression regulations, and it was closed for three days. The black market then emerged. The highest black market prices for various grades of edible oil were 90,000 yuan per担 (approximately 100 lbs) for raw oil, 80,000 yuan per担 for soybean oil, and 70,000 yuan per担 for rapeseed oil.</p>
<p>Official and Business Sectors Jointly Stabilize Market Prices</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, believing that this matter was related to people's livelihood, summoned oil and grain merchant representatives such as Yang Mingzhou on July 29, instructing them to consider the people's food supply and quickly resume business. At the same time, the responsible persons of the Oil and Grain Guild also convened a joint meeting with the oil extraction industry, resolving to resume normal business in the market from July 31. On the one hand, the market price of raw oil was reviewed based on the cost of the producing area, and it was decided that it should not exceed 85,000 yuan per担, the market price of soybean oil should not exceed 80,000 yuan per担, and the market price of rapeseed oil should not exceed 73,000 yuan per担. The reviewed prices were approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. At the same time, the Oil and Grain Guild was instructed to process the shipment of all oil and grain warehouse receipts that had already been traded on the market within one week. Subsequently, warehouse receipt transactions should not exceed ten days, in order to prevent abnormal and "kick the ball" transactions.</p>
<p>Direct Allocation by Two State-Run Oil Factories</p>
<p>The China Vegetable Oil Factory of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is also actively allocating edible oil to retail stores. There are a total of 600 retail stores, divided into three groups: A, B, and C, which have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. In addition, the China Edible Oil Company of the Ministry of Food also directly allocates raw oil to retail merchants, once a week, with each store receiving at least four barrels or so and up to ten barrels or so. It is not a fixed amount, and the allocation price is generally a few thousand yuan lower than the market price.</p>
<p>Daily Output of Seven Factories is More Than Enough for This City</p>
<p>The edible oil crisis has gradually calmed down due to these measures. Oil prices have also stabilized without suppression. According to oil industry insiders, the daily consumption of edible oil in this city is about 1,000担. It has been found that there are seven private oil extraction factories in this city: Dayouyu, Dachangxin, Dasheng, Dadexin, Changde, Weimin, and Shunyu. The total pre-war output of these seven factories was about 2,000担 per day. The recent total output has been reduced by about half, but it can still produce more than 1,000担 per day. Among these products, raw oil accounts for about 30%, and rapeseed oil accounts for about 70%. Therefore, in terms of the total output of these seven factories alone, the supply of edible oil for the entire city is more than sufficient. In addition, the China Vegetable Oil Factory can still produce more than 700担 of edible oil per day based on the current power supply. Once the power supply is fully restored, the output will increase even more. The China Edible Oil Company currently has as many as 3,000 to 4,000 barrels of oil in stock. Therefore, judging from the city's own ability to produce edible oil, there is absolutely no problem with the city's continuous and unlimited supply of edible oil.</p>
<p>Goods from Qingyun and Other Places Rely on Barter</p>
<p>Next, the supply of edible oil to this city from other places can be divided into long-distance and short-distance. Long-distance sources are mainly Dalian and Qingdao. However, due to recent local unrest and traffic obstruction in these two places, the sources have become increasingly sluggish. In addition, transportation tools rely on sailboats, and the shipping schedule cannot be determined. Nineteen out of ten transactions are based on barter. For example, in Dalian, it is necessary to exchange corn and wheat for goods. In Qingdao's small ports, it is necessary to exchange daily necessities, fancy clothes, and cotton cloth for goods. In the past two weeks, only 500 to 600 barrels of soybean oil, equivalent to more than 2,000担, have been shipped to this city from Dalian. In Qingdao, the market price of raw oil is 76,000 yuan per担. Adding barrel fees, leakage, discount, and miscellaneous expenses when shipping to Shanghai, it costs about 20,000 yuan per担. It is estimated that the net cost per担 after deducting the barrel is 90,000 yuan. However, the current market price of raw oil in Shanghai is only 80,000 yuan per担, so it is impossible to ship it to Shanghai for sale. Recently, the number of ships transporting oil has also decreased because all transport sailboats must be repaired and renovated at this time, which also affects the source of edible oil.</p>
<p>Goods from Changzhou and Wuxi Change with Market Prices</p>
<p>Short-distance sources such as Wuxi and Changzhou relied on this city for the supply of edible oil before the war. After the war, due to the soaring price of edible oil in this city, and there being many old-fashioned oil mills in Wuxi and Changzhou, which self-extracted edible oil, the market price was sometimes cheaper than that in Shanghai. Therefore, some edible oil was sometimes shipped to Shanghai. However, recently, the market price of soybean oil in these two places is about 76,000 yuan per担. Adding miscellaneous expenses of 7,000 to 8,000 yuan, the cost per担 after shipping to Shanghai has reached 82,000 to 83,000 yuan, so it is also impossible to ship it to Shanghai for sale. Therefore, the relationship between supply and demand of edible oil between Wuxi, Changzhou, and Shanghai depends purely on the level of oil prices in the two places. As for Suzhou and Songjiang, it is currently impossible to talk about supplying edible oil to this city.</p>
<p>Based on the above, this city cannot yet have high hopes for the supply of edible oil from other places. However, if it can restore local order and facilitate traffic, the addition of external sources will be another factor for stabilizing the edible oil problem in this city.</p>
<p>Oil Merchants Feel Depressed After Direct Allocation</p>
<p>Although the edible oil problem in this city has now come to an end, the 70 to 80 oil firms under the Oil and Grain Guild have complained. These oil firms usually act as intermediaries in the market, earning commissions. Now, the China Vegetable Oil Factory and the China Edible Oil Company allocate edible oil directly to retail merchants without the help of oil firms. From the perspective of the China Vegetable Oil Factory and the China Edible Oil Company, this move is to simplify allocation procedures and make prices simple and low, so that the general public can benefit. However, as a result, the livelihoods of these 70 to 80 oil firms are threatened because they have no business to operate. In addition, based on the current market price of edible oil in this city, it is impossible to purchase and transport edible oil from Qingdao and other places, so oil merchants feel depressed. It is said that they have now petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting improvement in the allocation methods of the China Vegetable Oil Factory and other factories. At the same time, they are trying to encourage various merchants to purchase edible oil in various producing areas and transport it to Shanghai for sale, in order to maintain the livelihoods of oil merchants.</p>
<h3>Worsted Wool Fabric Sales Launch</h3>
<p>Worsted wool fabric has recently become popular, and customers from distant places continue to inquire about purchases. Because it is a popular commodity, its usual market price is much higher than other types of wool fabric. The "Tiger" brand is the most important, followed by "Hualun Jiaotong." The price fluctuations of other brands of worsted wool fabric largely depend on these two brands, because customers from all over the interior provinces and regions base their purchases on these two brands. In terms of color, grass green is still the most popular, followed by navy blue and then primary color. In terms of price, the factories and retailers have different prices based on the sales conditions. Goods of the same quality can differ by several thousand yuan per yard. Currently, the asking price for Yinfeng grass green worsted wool fabric at the public tea party is 70,000 yuan, navy blue is 62,500 yuan, and primary green is 55,000 to 60,000 yuan. In addition, old-fashioned cyan-gray and blue-gray worsted wool fabric have recently become fashionable again.</p>
<h3>Freight for Tung Oil from Chongqing to Shanghai is Ten Times Higher than from Shanghai to the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 3rd] American merchants purchasing Chinese tung oil claim that the sluggish supply of tung oil in the United States is mainly due to the slow transportation and high freight costs from the Chinese production area to the export location. The market price of tung oil has not fluctuated and remains at 38 3/8 cents per pound for bulk and 39 to 41 cents per pound for barreled. Due to the restoration of price controls, merchants are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards ordering tung oil. According to recent news from China, tung oil in Hankou and other inland areas has risen in price. It takes about two months to transport goods from Chongqing to Shanghai, and the freight cost is 30,000 Chinese yuan (approximately 15 US dollars), which is about ten times higher than the ocean freight rate from Shanghai to the United States. Merchants here hope that the recent allocation of inland river-suitable vessels to China by the United States will accelerate cargo transportation on the Yangtze River. The American agricultural mission currently in China is working to increase tung oil production from the current 40,000 tons to more than the pre-war production of 75,000 tons, so that both China and purchasing countries can benefit.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea in Hangzhou are Both on the Brink of Collapse; 61 Silk Stores Have Closed; Tea Warehouses are Also Overwhelmed by Usury</h3>
<p>[Hangzhou News] The silk industry in Hangzhou is facing difficulties in both export and domestic sales, and wages are extremely high, making costs very heavy. So far, it has been difficult to develop. In addition, their own financial resources are weak, and they have to rely on usury to turn around. Therefore, according to the guild's statistics, 61 silk stores have closed due to the difficulty of operation, accounting for one-fifth of the total number of silk stores in this city. Yesterday, Hengfu Silk Store declared bankruptcy due to a shortage of funds and the inability to turn around, with losses estimated at around 50 to 60 million yuan. It is reported that this has shaken more than seven or eight stores, and the market is panicked and feels uneasy.</p>
<p>In addition, Zhejiang tea, except for Longjing produced specifically for sale in this province and Shanghai, is completely exported from Ping Shui and Wenzhou. In addition, tea produced in Anhui and Jiangxi is concentrated in Hangzhou. Therefore, there are many tea warehouses in Hangzhou. Recently, due to the lack of export channels and the pressure of usury, the number of those who have been forced to close down is increasing day by day. Gongyi Xiang has gone bankrupt, and Ruihe and Xie Xingyong have negotiated with creditors to repay debts by stopping interest. The remaining tea firms are uneasy due to this impact.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Seafood Market</h3>
<p>The seafood market is experiencing quiet supply and sales, with all goods trending towards stagnation. Due to the excessive arrival of Yichang fungus, the export of tree ears is not moving, and street sales are also dull, leading to a significant decline. There are few newly arrived Xiang lotus seeds, and sales are slow. It is said that goods are arriving continuously by land, and the market will likely be cheaper in the future. About one hundred and ten boxes of Hong Kong shrimp tails are about to arrive in Shanghai. However, the quality is poor and the quantity is insufficient. At this time of sluggish trading, it will be difficult to establish a foothold. High-quality Haiwei dried scallops have a thin stock but sell well, and the arrival of goods is extremely scarce, causing prices to rise. The momentum of other goods is stagnant and dull, and prices are also mediocre.</p>
<p>High Price of Glutinous Rice Branches</p>
<p>Glutinous rice branches are priced higher than old stock due to low production. Recently, the arrival of sources is scarce, and the market stock is also in short supply, so the price has risen again, increasing by about 20% overall. The market price is around 700,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Kerosene Overwhelms Coal Balls; Hongji Coal Dust Still Out of Stock</h3>
<p>Since the resumption of production by various coal ball factories in this city, sales have been unusually sluggish. According to statistics, the total sales volume is less than a quarter of what it was before the war. The industry has reduced the selling price from 10,000 yuan to 8,000 yuan, but the result has not improved. It is said that there are three reasons for this: (1) Kerosene is being sold in large quantities, and citizens find it more cost-effective, so they are happy to use it; (2) In the two or three decades after the surrender, many citizens have switched to burning firewood because the factories did not supply coal balls; (3) Hongyi coal dust is not flowing smoothly due to maritime transportation relations, and the cost is high, so there is no way to reduce the price further.</p>
<h3>Czech Finance Minister Says Exchange Will Never Reopen</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 4th] Czech Finance Minister Dr. Ďuriš told Reuters yesterday that the Prague Stock Exchange would never reopen because under the planned economy system, there is no place for its existence. Mr. Ďuriš is the first Communist to serve as Minister of Finance.</p>

<h3>Factors Endangering the Dyeing and Weaving Industry; Two Immediate Relief Measures; The Content of the Industry's Submissions to the Ministry of Finance and Economics</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Currently, the textile industry is the only industry that can be supported, especially the spinning industry, which is relatively prosperous. However, the dyeing and weaving industry does not have spinning equipment, and the yarn factories that also operate weaving are not included in the scope of the industry. This industry is a general term for pure dyeing factories, pure weaving factories, and dyeing and weaving factories. Its situation is different from that of the yarn factory industry. Since the enemy puppets forcibly purchased yarn and cloth, the dyeing and weaving industry and the sales business of cotton cloth and cotton yarn were the most severely damaged. The dyeing and weaving industry is even more unsustainable due to the pressure of high interest rates. Recently, due to the imminent crisis, it has submitted reports to the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Finance, requesting relief. The following is an excerpt of its content:</p>
<p>The machine dyeing and weaving industry has a history of more than 40 years since its inception. It is the oldest and most established industry in the light industry. Before the war, there were 1,200 factories in the Shanghai area, with 160 dyeing machines and 30,000 weaving machines. There were 120,000 workers, with a daily output of 60,000 woven cloths and 160,000 dyed cloths, making it the center of the domestic light industry. However, since the victory, the resumption of work in the dyeing and weaving industry has been fraught with difficulties, and all factories have fallen into despair. Those who have not started work are even more at a loss and are sitting and waiting to die. According to the current production volume, it is only half of what it was before the war. The factors that have caused the crisis are:</p>
<p>(1) Special Losses During the War of Resistance</p>
<p>In August of the 32nd year, the enemy puppets forcibly requisitioned yarn and cloth, and the dyeing and weaving factories bore the brunt. A total of 3,400 pieces of yarn and 999,407 pieces of cloth were seized, resulting in a loss of 29,127,267,100 yuan, accounting for 76% of the working capital.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of Funds and High Interest Rates</p>
<p>According to the industrial production process, it takes a relatively long time, and the capital turnover is also slow, which is not as fast as that of commerce. According to the current operation of the machine dyeing and weaving industry, even the smallest factory needs a working capital of 50 million yuan per month. Calculated at an interest rate of 20%, the monthly amount is as high as 10 million yuan. Now, a total of 453 factories are in operation, with an average monthly supply of working capital of 100 million yuan, totaling 45.3 billion yuan. The interest expenditure requires 9.06 billion yuan. Calculated at a cost of 50,000 yuan per piece of gray cloth, 181,200 pieces of cloth can be woven. The pressure of high interest rates is heavy, and the selling price is also expensive. In the cost of living index published by the Shanghai Municipal Government in May and June, the item of clothing has the highest number, which is clear evidence.</p>
<p>(3) Expensive Raw Materials and Difficult Processing</p>
<p>At the beginning of the victory, 20-count yarn was only about 120,000 yuan per piece. The average price in June was 1.2 million yuan, which is more than 10 times higher. The crux of the problem is that yarn prices are not regulated, and the state-owned textile construction company is making a profit. For the cotton products industry, such as yarn, one piece can weave 34 pieces of cloth. Calculated at a price of 1.2 million yuan per piece of 20-count yarn, the raw material alone requires more than 35,000 yuan. Other factory payments such as power, wages, donations, taxes, and high interest rates all contribute to the increase in costs, while cloth is only sold for about 50,000 yuan, so there is not only no profit to be made, but even losses.</p>
<p>To sum up the above three points, the crisis of our machine dyeing and weaving industry is actually due to the seizure by the enemy puppets, the shortage of funds, the pressure of high interest rates, and the expensive raw materials. The only way to remedy the situation is to:</p>
<p>(1) Quickly Issue and Select the Remaining Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>This remaining yarn and cloth originally belonged to the victimized manufacturers, and is by no means enemy puppet property. The industry association has repeatedly submitted reports to the handling authorities requesting its return, but it has not been approved to date. It is important to know that returning the yarn and cloth is to revive the vitality of the dyeing and weaving industry, replenish the resources for production, and is also the key to reversing the crisis. Therefore, we should request that the authorities be ordered to quickly issue and return it.</p>
<p>(2) Urgently Handle Dyeing and Weaving Industrial Loans</p>
<p>The dyeing and weaving industry has also requested industrial loans from the Four Joint Offices, but most have not received a response. Even the three or four companies that have been invited to be approved have not yet received the funds. The request to issue funds has not been answered, and there is even a proposal to stop industrial loans because they are enough to fuel inflation. How can it be known that the factory shutdown and the industrial crisis are all due to a lack of funds? Obtaining loans will inevitably first reduce high-interest debt, and the currency can therefore be contracted, and there is absolutely no possibility of fueling inflation. The needs of the dyeing and weaving industry for loans are to add equipment and purchase raw materials, and the bulk of raw materials are the yarn and cloth of the China Textile Company and the dyes of the Defu Foreign Company. One is state-owned and the other is enemy property. Therefore, the use of loans is generally on the right track and is also a state-owned income, and there is no concern about inflation.</p>
<p>For this reason, the crisis of the dyeing and weaving industry and the way to save it are presented, and we pray that you will order the Four Joint Offices to quickly organize dyeing and weaving industrial loans, and simplify the loan procedures so as to facilitate emergency relief and benefit production.</p>

<h3>Inside a Mental Hospital</h3>
<p>— Written by Our Reporter So Bei, Photography by Ting Peng Chuang Shuo</p>
<p>Villagers rarely suffer from mental illness. They lead simple lives, engaging in more physical labor and less mental exertion, neither constantly indulging in wild thoughts nor harboring excessive desires. Consequently, many doctors have told reporters that mental illness is, in fact, a disease of civilization. For the same reason, the number of mentally ill individuals in the United States is also increasing year by year. According to the July issue of "Reader's Digest," President Truman recently declared to Congress: "At least two million people in the United States suffer from mental illness. At least ten million people, at some point in their lives, will need to be admitted to a mental hospital."</p>
<p>Half of All Hospital Beds in the U.S. Occupied by Mental Patients</p>
<p>"Forty-seven percent of all hospital beds in the United States are occupied by mental patients; in Massachusetts and New York, one in every one hundred and fifty people suffers from mental illness, and in every one hundred adults, at least one will suffer from mental illness at some point in their lives."</p>
<p>This is a report from the American medical community recently received by Mr. Zhang Yuanchang, Director of the Department of Mental Diseases at the Chinese Red Cross.</p>
<p>Shanghai, a city of extreme and distorted prosperity, now has more mental patients than before the war. However, society has little awareness of this. Many minor nerve disorders and mild manic disorders (including those who are arrogant and consider themselves superior) are considered simply eccentric personalities, not recognized as pathological conditions. Some time ago, a young dancer forcibly occupied someone's seat in a dance hall, leading to a conflict with other dancers. As a result, he was beaten bloody, yet remained stubborn and defiant. When taken to the police station, he still refused to "cooperate." Consequently, the police sent him to the Red Cross for treatment, who then transferred him to the Department of Mental Diseases. This patient was an extremely arrogant mentally ill individual.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Mental Hospital Founded by Mr. Lu Bohong</p>
<p>Shanghai has a very large mental hospital with nearly three hundred patients, including people of various nationalities. The facilities are excellent, but few people know about it. This hospital is the Puchi Sanatorium, located not far from Minhang, just north of the North Bridge Bus Station on the Shanghai-Minhang Highway. It was founded eleven years ago by the late Mr. Lu Bohong, with the background of the Catholic Charity Association and the Catholic Welfare Committee. After Mr. Lu's assassination, his son, Mr. Lu Yinggeng, took over. Although it is called a sanatorium, it is actually a mental hospital. The reason it is not called a mental hospital is due to careful consideration: some patients' families consider it a disgrace to send family members to a mental hospital or madhouse.</p>
<p>The architecture and environment of the Puchi Sanatorium are magnificent and serene. Even the most volatile and stubborn patients, upon entering the hospital gates, I believe, would feel refreshed and uplifted.</p>
<p>Inside, there are five or six ward buildings, divided into four classes. The first-class fee is less than 20,000 yuan per day (including three meals, snacks, and miscellaneous expenses), the second-class fee is 10,000 yuan, the third-class fee is 7,000 yuan, and the fourth-class fee is free.</p>
<p>Speaking of free, it's not just the fourth class. Currently, there are one hundred and fifty patients who pay nothing at all. Among them are the "street lunatics" sent by the former Shanghai Municipal Council, as well as patients whose history is as long as the hospital's. They have nowhere to go, and their illnesses have not improved, so the hospital has no choice but to accommodate them.</p>
<p>More than thirty patients, due to treatment being sought too late (approximately two or three years after the onset of the illness), have no hope of recovery. These groups of despair are housed in the wards of another building. Although these people still suffer from mental illness, they are no longer violent. Their thoughts are probably trapped in a state of chaotic stillness, rarely speaking or moving. There is a female nun who, after becoming ill, was hospitalized for treatment but to no effect. Now, she stands all day with her hands clasped, muttering to herself, but without sound, often smiling at people. Her bed is often covered with many books, on which are written incomprehensible words, occasionally including phrases like "I am the Holy King."</p>
<p>Mental patients interrupt when doctors inspect the wards and talk. Doctors can glean part of the source of their illness from their incoherent words.</p>
<p>Mental patients playing dominoes.</p>
<p>Various Types of Chinese and Foreign Mental Patients Are Amusing</p>
<p>In total, there are two hundred and eighty-six patients, including fifty-six foreigners, comprising British, Portuguese, Russian, Greek, Jewish, and other nationalities, with Jews being the most numerous. There is a Greek patient who has suffered from mental illness since childhood, likely congenital. This person has no teeth, and his physical appearance is quite robust. He has never spoken a word, constantly tapping his left fist with his right hand, causing changes to the skin on his left fist. When the reporter tried to take his picture, he quickly ran away. It is said that this Greek man's father is a wealthy businessman. He is an "only child" and was extremely spoiled by his parents, but his mother was killed by him.</p>
<p>Walking into the wards, the strange and varied sights do not make you laugh, but rather make you think: why are there so many tragedies in the world? These patients, the sufferers outside the circle of happiness, may have once had beautiful encounters, but now they are all protagonists of tragedy. "Are more people driven mad by failed speculation or by disappointment in love?" I asked Dr. Liu Yide (a mental health expert). "Recently, many have become ill due to failed speculation," he replied.</p>
<p>Then, a patient said to the reporter, "Shanghai is asking him to settle the accounts! Settle the accounts!!" It is said that this patient asks everyone to settle the accounts.</p>
<p>The ward facilities have no significant or unusual features because one cannot increase the stimulation to the patients' nerves. Knowing that the glass windows are often sacrificed by patients, you cannot add wire mesh, making the patients feel like they are in prison. Here, the ward windows only have beautiful iron bars for protection, aiming to protect the glass without leaving a mark. In the United States, they use shatterproof glass. Here, the patients' dining room is also beautifully decorated, with white tablecloths, vases, and paintings, very artistic.</p>
<p>Patients are divided into two categories: civil and military. The civil ones are "thinkers" and "artists" who go crazy on their own, not bothering others, making music, and drawing pictures. The walls of the wards are adorned with excellent works. The military ones are the opposite, using their hands and feet and talking. Probably the patients who have just entered the hospital are more military, with not a few who hit people. The hospital, in addition to nurses accompanying them, temporarily puts leather gloves on those who are very violent, tying their hands together, making it impossible for them to act.</p>
<p>Their daily life is very regulated, with outdoor activities every day. Those who like religion or are originally religious attend church in the hospital on Sundays. Incoming mail is inspected by the hospital, and anything considered to stimulate the patient's mind is withheld.</p>

<p>(Above) A mental patient, in the ward, spreads out their written works and items on the bed, sitting quietly and reading aloud. (Below) A mental patient who lies in bed all day, constantly muttering.</p>
<p>Hospital Finances Are Tight, Relying on Church and Red Cross Support</p>
<p>Although the hospital is large, because it is non-profit, almost half of the patients cannot afford to pay, and even those who pay are very limited. Damage to property by patients is also unavoidable, so the hospital's finances are not very comfortable. It relies entirely on the church and the hospital director to find ways to manage. Therefore, the British Red Cross and the U.S. military have donated to the hospital. The U.S. military has also sent many English magazines for patients to read. The hospital hopes to receive donated Chinese newspapers for use by Chinese patients.</p>
<p>Due to financial difficulties, the hospital is discussing with the Municipal Health Bureau the long-term accommodation of those who cannot afford to pay and have no hope of recovery. Indeed, those groups of despair no longer contribute to society, but from a humanitarian standpoint, the government should provide relief to the disabled.</p>
<p>The Puchi Sanatorium was established in June of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935) and was founded by the late Lu Bohong, near the North Bridge Town of Minhang.</p>
<p>Measures for Clearing Land Rights in Recovered Areas</p>
<p>Land rights in recovered areas, due to the disturbance and changes caused by the enemy and puppet regimes during the occupation period, have frequently led to disputes since the victory. The government has formulated and promulgated measures for clearing land rights in recovered areas to protect the legitimate rights of the original landowners and to serve as the basis for handling the clearing of land rights in recovered areas. The measures stipulate that the property certificates held for land rights are limited to the following four clauses: (1) land title deeds issued by legally registered land; (2) land business licenses issued by legally filed land reports; (3) land right certificates issued by other laws and regulations for sorting out land registration; and (4) original land right certificates held by the people in areas where land registration has not been sorted out in accordance with laws and regulations. Any disposal of the company's land by the enemy and puppet organizations and the land right certificates issued by them are invalid. If the documents held by the landowner are stamped with the seals of enemy and puppet organizations, the original enemy and puppet seals shall be stamped with the "invalid" mark during the clearing. The public land released for farming is also invalid. However, if the recipient is a self-cultivating farmer and continues to cultivate, he may be given a time limit to reapply for the contract procedures and be exempted from payment. For private land that has been confiscated or forcibly occupied, the landowner shall be issued a property certificate for return. If the landowner cannot produce a property certificate, he may obtain a certificate from the county, township, town, and village heads, or from the four neighbors. For private land that has been levied with payment, it shall be kept in government custody for clearing. The landowner may be allowed to submit conclusive evidence to pay back the amount received at the time of levy according to the monthly issue of the price index. For private land forcibly occupied by the people of enemy countries or traitors, the original landowner's rights may be returned if they present property evidence. In areas where the municipal and county governments could not exercise political power during the war, the transfer of land rights shall be registered by the land rights transferee with the municipal and county government within six months of the local recovery of government power. In areas where land registration has not yet been carried out, tax deeds shall be supplemented. The land rights clearing agency shall be the county and municipal government. However, the land received by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau shall be jointly cleared by the Bureau and the county and municipal governments. [Central News Agency]</p>

<p>Nurses Work Hard and Endure the Patients' Beatings and Scoldings</p>
<p>What is most touching are the three doctors and nurses (more than twenty nurses, twelve of whom are nuns). They quietly sacrifice their own enjoyment outside the circle of the city to treat the insane. The nurses endure the patients' beatings and scoldings, constantly paying attention to the patients' actions, working hard and bearing grievances, which is commendable. When patients tear up the sheets, break the windows, and lose their temper, they can only clean up for them properly.</p>
<p>Mr. Dong, a director of the Charity Association, a French national, is responsible for the actual affairs of the hospital. He is sixty years old, but looks only forty. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, he was once arrested and beaten while hung up. After his release, a tumor grew on his neck, which has now healed. He said that the main reason why this hospital was able to exist during the occupation period was that there were many Japanese mental patients in the hospital.</p>
<p>The Pathology, Causes, and Treatment of Mental Illness Are Progressing Rapidly</p>
<p>Regarding the causes of mental illness, there are three distinctions: congenital, acquired, and physiological and psychological. The main reason is that self-control is too poor, and one cannot cope with unexpected blows. Diseases caused by other high-fever illnesses that injure the brain nerves, and diseases caused by syphilis also exist. There are two methods of treatment: drug treatment and work treatment. There are three drugs used for medicinal injections: (1) insulin, (2) malaria blood, and (3) Gardesol. The first drug is made from human insulin. After injection, it causes the patient to develop a high fever and become comatose and quiet. This drug is mostly used when violent patients first enter the hospital. The second type is used for patients whose brains are invaded by venereal disease bacteria, which is called "fighting poison with poison." The injection of the third drug causes the patient to develop a disease, after which the mind can be clear, but the reaction is strong, and the patient suffers greatly.</p>
<p>In recent years, the theory of psychoanalyst Freud has been the most valued in the study of mental illness treatment. His view is "sex." He said that due to excessive suppression of sexual aspects, a certain desire lurking in the subconscious is vented in a different way, thus becoming a madman. An example can illustrate this: there was once a patient who stomped his feet hard on the ground all day long, constantly, and the patient himself did not know why. Later, a doctor analyzed it in his dream and discovered that he had fallen in love with his sister-in-law but could not fulfill his wish. When the doctor revealed this mystery in his heart, the patient recovered. Freud's theory is based entirely on sex. He believes that women often use their own father as the standard for choosing a spouse, and men often use their own mother as the standard for choosing a spouse. According to doctors at Puchi Sanatorium, this theory attracted their attention and research several years ago. Now, everyone believes that this theory is too biased.</p>
<p>A mental patient sits blankly all day without saying a word. When someone arrives, they stand up, bow, and then sit blankly.</p>
<p>Putting Patients' Psychology on the Right Track Is the Most Effective Treatment</p>
<p>The latest treatment method, it is said, focuses on analyzing the patient's psychology (if it is an acquired mental illness). Many patients suffer from mental illness because they do not get what they want. Then, the treatment method should be aimed at the root of the disease. The latest treatment method does not rely solely on drugs, but putting the patient's psychology on the right track is the most effective method. For example, work therapy, using tools similar to Chinese tangrams to test the patient's psychology and guide the patient's thinking, are all more advanced methods. In the United States, the country spends 738.5 million US dollars on mental patients every year, which shows the government's attention. Their treatment methods are, of course, changing with each passing day.</p>
<p>The above report focuses on the Puchi Sanatorium because it is the only complete mental hospital in the Far East. And many families have members who suffer from mental illness, but they do not know where to send them.</p>
<p>The Red Cross's Department of Mental Diseases Has Thirty Beds</p>
<p>In the urban area of Shanghai, there is also the Department of Mental Diseases of the Chinese Red Cross, which also has thirty beds. As for the "Shanghai Mental Hospital," because it is privately run, funding is extremely difficult. Although it has a history of more than twenty years, the current situation is extremely poor. The reporter visited the hospital, but there was almost nothing worth reporting.</p>
<p>"Mental illness, a disease of civilization. People in civilized societies should pay attention to their mental health." This is what Dr. Liu Yide, a specialist in mental illness, said. "People who can control themselves, adapt to the environment, and meet the standards of most people do not have mental illness! People who can enjoy but also endure hardship, and who are not dominated by external stimuli! We believe that such people are the most physically and mentally healthy, and have the highest character! The occurrence of mental illness is mainly due to whether one is healthy or not, and external stimuli are only the fuse!" This is what another mental health specialist, Zhang Yuanchang, said. These words seem to be worthy of reference.</p>

<h3>Venereal Disease Hospital</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Dingshan</p>
<p>Just as gambling dens are surrounded by countless pawnshops and pledge shops, the so-called "red-light district" of Xizang Road, 2nd and 3rd Mafu Road is full of venereal disease hospitals.</p>
<p>A losing gambler who walks out of a gambling den can take off his handcuffs, gold ring, and gown and exchange them at a pawnshop for gambling money, in preparation for another round. He considers it a convenience no matter what. He doesn't care about the high-interest exploitation.</p>
<p>Similarly, for those who like to indulge in prostitution, they first go to a nearby hospital for a preventative shot before anything happens. If they contract a disease afterward, they get a "606" injection. These cheap hospitals that "guarantee a cure and complete eradication" are their perfect destination.</p>
<p>However, please forgive me for saying something disrespectful to certain "Doctors of Medicine" who have "studied in Germany" or "studied in the United States." Venereal disease and tuberculosis are their only shortcuts to making a living and getting rich. Many doctors rely on prostitutes, dancers, and other people who sell their bodies as a way to make a living.</p>
<p>In the "red-light district," you can see small storefronts with white-painted glass windows that say "Guaranteed Cure for Gonorrhea, Syphilis," etc. at any time and anywhere. Suppose you are a patient and you run into that white and dirty threshold. You will find that it is a messy little reception room. At this time, you lose the feeling of being in a "hospital." Smart doctors use partitions to divide a small room into two rooms. The inner room is the consulting room, which is probably the smallest and most crowded hospital in the world. The messy furniture and medical equipment are so crowded that there is not even room for two or three people to stand. At that time, if you tell the doctor that you have gonorrhea, he will immediately ask you to take off your pants. (At this time, you have already paid the 1,000 yuan registration fee.) Second, he will ask you to take a blood test. He will draw a lot of your blood, and the blood test fee you have to pay is probably four or five thousand yuan. He takes the blood to a specialized testing laboratory, from which he can get a commission on the blood test fee.</p>
<p>The third step is that he will scare you. He says that you have a fairly severe case of syphilis, but it will be fine after he treats it. He speaks very smoothly. If you have chancroid, he will say that soft chancre is guaranteed to heal in three days, and hard chancre is also very easy to heal. If you have gonorrhea, he will say that acute gonorrhea will be effective with one injection, and chronic gonorrhea can also be quickly eradicated. He wants you to get an injection, and the injection fee is up to him. If you really don't have a disease, he will use glucose to replace it. There are different ingredients for syphilis injections, depending on the person's physique, such as 0.4, 0.45, 0.6, etc. They will also trick you with the injections to get your money. Because they don't welcome you buying medicine outside.</p>
<p>Some advertising doctors call for cheap prices. If it were as they said, the transportation cost would not be enough. How is it possible to ask for genuine goods and complete eradication? In the past, the Medical Association had restrictions on members from publishing long-term advertisements, but now, this regulation has been virtually eliminated, and most of these doctors have not joined the association, so they do not need to be restricted by this regulation.</p>
<p>Shanghai's venereal disease doctors can be roughly divided into four types: (1) doctors who sell Chinese patent medicines, who sell medicines such as kidney-tonifying pills and Longhu Dan, and earn money by selling medicines. Their customers are mostly from the countryside. They also give injections, but they are Chinese acupuncture injections. (2) Venereal disease doctors with semi-Chinese and semi-Western four-room storefronts along Xizang Road account for most of Shanghai's venereal disease doctors. The descriptions are roughly as above, and there are also some experienced and effective doctors among them. (3) Venereal disease doctors with real skills. Their customers are mostly ladies from well-known families, good women, and concubines, because they are concerned about their face and it is inconvenient to publicize it. Like these doctors, three or four customers a year are enough to cover their expenses. In addition, they rely on stockpiles of Western aphrodisiacs. (4) Formal venereal disease doctors in public hospitals.</p>
<p>Now, on the one hand, the Health Bureau is registering doctors, and those who are unqualified will be banned. On the other hand, the police are also starting to ban dancing and prostitution. The business of these doctors and "doctors" will be greatly affected, or even completely eliminated. This is inevitable.</p>

<h3>Reader Q&amp;A: Legal Queries</h3>
<p>(1) Mr. Xian Zhijie asks: My late father ran a rice shop. A certain Mr. Jia operated a restaurant, and through business dealings, accumulated a debt of 542 silver dollars for rice. At the time, a receipt from the Jiangtan area was used as collateral. Later, Mr. Jia intentionally delayed payment. My mother then filed a lawsuit with the authorities. Because the defendant avoided appearing in court, the receipt and silver money ledger were submitted to the Baoshan County authorities for investigation. Subsequently, the Baoshan County government ruled that Mr. Jia should pay the debt in full at once, with the litigation costs borne by the defendant. However, the defendant avoids meeting, making enforcement impossible. Now, Mr. Jia wants to ask someone to mediate. How should we proceed? Please answer: (1) The debt was incurred in 1924. Because the defendant avoided meeting, enforcement was impossible. At that time, I was still an infant, so it was never handled. Will the debt become invalid due to the lapse of time? (2) The original debt was 542 silver dollars. Currently, repayment cannot be based on the rice price and silver dollars. However, according to legal regulations, what is the total amount of principal and interest? (3) If converted to legal tender for repayment, it would be very advantageous to the defendant, but I would suffer a great loss. Is there any legal remedy? (4) The collateral receipt was lost when submitted to the Baoshan County government. Can I apply for a replacement and take possession of the property? (5) Can I hire a lawyer to handle it?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers:] (1) It will not become invalid due to the lapse of time. (2) (3) Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Restoration, which governs cases with a final verdict, appears difficult to invoke. (4) If the collateral is not redeemed according to the judgment, you can petition for compulsory execution to auction the collateral. If the practicing certificate is lost, it can be requested. (5) You may hire a lawyer to handle it.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Wang Xiren from Wuxi asks: When a certain Mr. (omitted) was dying, he wrote three copies of his will. The first and last copies were lost, leaving only the middle page. It was written in pencil and unsigned. Of the two brothers, one acknowledges the will, while the other denies it. Does this will have any validity? Please answer in the Social Services section.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers:] A handwritten will that does not meet the signature requirements is not valid according to Article 1190 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Chen Zhongxing asks: In the first half of 1944, due to urgent needs, I borrowed 100,000 yuan of counterfeit currency from a friend. There was no written agreement. Now my friend is demanding repayment. I don't know how to handle it or what the repayment method should be. Here are three points, please answer. I would be extremely grateful. (1) Is it reasonable to repay 100,000 yuan of national currency for the 100,000 yuan of counterfeit currency I borrowed? (2) If my friend wants to settle the debt based on the price of goods in 1944, is that legal? What can I do to deal with it? (3) If my friend sues me, how should I respond?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers:] It is best to resolve it through mutual agreement. Otherwise, it should be fairly assessed by the court in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Restoration, increasing the payment.</p>
<h3>Service Briefs</h3>
<p>Motorized Vehicle for Newspaper Delivery: To improve delivery efficiency, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau will use motorized bicycles for newspaper delivery, but due to the limited number of vehicles, it will only be used for important and express telegrams. This method is being used for the first time in our country.</p>
<p>Lost and Found: I found a service card of Navy Wang Yixi of the Chu Guan warship at the Dashijie tram station at around 11 PM on the 26th of last month. It has been handed over to ticket seller number 31 of the French Tramway Company for safekeeping. The owner is requested to go there to inquire and claim it.</p>
<p>Huguo Free Clinic and Pharmacy: Abbot Langting of the Huguo Chan Monastery (i.e., Laoximen Guandi Temple) on Fuxing East Road, along with local gentry Huang Jinrong, Fan Kaitai, Chen Qiguang, and colleagues from the National Medicine Industry Association and the Herbal Medicine Industry Association, have established the "Huguo Free Clinic and Pharmacy," which opened at the beginning of this month. The clinic is open from 9 AM to 12 PM and 2 PM to 5 PM daily, and all medical and pharmaceutical expenses are waived.</p>
<p>Free Clinic and Pharmacy: Traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Cao Xiwan has established a clinic at No. 8 Changqing Lane, Datong Road, and is now offering free medical services and medication, from 8 AM to 11 AM daily.</p>
<p>Free Furuncle Medicine: Jicangzhai's family-secret, special-effect furuncle medicine can stop pain and promote healing with just one application for all kinds of furuncles. This medicine is not for sale, but exclusively for free distribution, which has been the practice for many years. Recently, life has become more difficult, and medicine prices have increased significantly. Patients often suffer from a lack of appropriate free treatment. In view of this, I am still offering free distribution as usual. Patients can go to Lu Daren Hall at No. 21 Yongnian Lane, Baike Road, for treatment, and no consultation fee will be charged.</p>
<p>Xu Xiangren Offers "Treatise on Cholera"</p>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read in your column that cholera is severe in various places this year, and hospitals are suffering from overcrowding! I intend to donate my humble work, "Treatise on Cholera," to all sectors, but only a limited number will be available. It might be helpful. However, for Western medicine treatment, proper equipment is essential. For Chinese medicine treatment, preparing medicine is paramount. Medicines must be prepared early so that they can be used when needed. I specifically request your column to disclose this. Respectfully, Xu Xiangren of the Shanghai Daily Social Services Column (Address: No. 17, Lane 796, Beijing Road)</p>
<h3>Direct Tax Bureau Messengers Must Not Collect Taxes on Behalf of Taxpayers</h3>
<p>Violators Will Be Severely Punished: It has been reported that some merchants in this city, after receiving tax payment notices from this Bureau, have entrusted the Bureau's messengers to submit tax payments to the national treasury. This practice easily leads to abuses. To prevent this, this Bureau has strictly instructed its messengers to absolutely not accept tax payments on behalf of taxpayers, otherwise they will be severely punished. It is hoped that when businesses in this city receive tax payment notices, they will submit the tax payments to the national treasury themselves, and not entrust the Bureau's messengers to pay on their behalf, to avoid abuses. Please disclose this in your column. Respectfully, Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance to the Shanghai Daily Social Services Department</p>

<h3>Mrs. Marshall's Life in Lushan</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu, Dispatch from Kuling, Day One</p>
<p>Since the Five-Star General arrived on the mountain, undoubtedly, the political atmosphere of Lushan has begun to pervade.</p>
<p>Amidst this pervading atmosphere, reporters are striving to discern the movements of these five stars – General Marshall’s life.</p>
<p>Of course, the activities of Mrs. Marshall are also something the general public is keen to know about. Here, we record some snippets about Mrs. Marshall's movements.</p>
<p>If you want to know what time Mrs. Marshall gets up every day, we can tell you here: she is an early riser. Half past seven in the morning is her standard wake-up time. Before she gets out of bed, one essential routine is to drink a cup of black coffee. Two lightly boiled eggs, three slices of toast, a cup of coffee, and some fruit – that’s Mrs. Marshall’s breakfast, usually taken around half past nine.</p>
<p>After lunch, Mrs. Marshall invariably takes a nap. Her lunch is quite simple: two pieces of chicken or steak, some cold vegetables – carrots, potatoes, green beans – and then a glass of watermelon juice or other fruit juice, and that’s it. Mrs. Marshall doesn’t want to become a plump lady. After a nap of no more than two hours, it’s tea time, which consists of a cup of cocoa and a few biscuits. Dinner is usually eaten at half past seven, and it's even lighter than lunch. Although she should have ample time to rest and recuperate in this quiet and leisurely environment, Mrs. Marshall still doesn’t go to bed until around eleven o’clock. Perhaps this is because she cares about her husband and helps him with his work.</p>
<p>The deep affection and mutual respect between the Marshalls are as strong as during their honeymoon period, as has long been known to the general readership.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marshall is constantly mindful of Mr. Marshall's every move, taking care of him meticulously. She always feels that since Mr. Marshall came to China, he has been working in a tense atmosphere, striving for the realization of Chinese peace, and doing a very great work. Therefore, she is eager to share some of his hardships and make his life a little easier. When she came up the mountain this time, she specially brought him a set of grayish-blue western-style clothes to change into, and then told him: "Now, you can finally take off that five-star general's uniform and avoid restricting yourself all day long."</p>
<p>And Mr. Marshall? He also thinks of his wife’s boredom and loneliness on the mountain at all times and feels very sorry, so he specially brought a set of checkers to relieve her boredom. Whenever he has a little time, he plays checkers with his wife. If she loses, she always insists on playing another game.</p>
<p>During the period when Mr. Marshall was away from Kuling, she would call Nanjing at least twice a day to ask about her husband's well-being. Especially when she knew that Mr. Marshall was coming up the mountain that day, she had already instructed the cook to prepare her husband's favorite dishes, and kept sending people to the radio station to inquire about the time of his arrival on the mountain, and then personally rode a sedan chair to the top of the mountain, looking up and waiting for him.</p>
<p>Besides sometimes inviting Chairman Chiang and his wife over for dinner, Mrs. Marshall hasn’t formally invited any guests for a banquet since coming to the mountain. Before lunch or after tea, she often strolls around the vicinity with Chairman Chiang and his wife, or goes on picnics with them, or chats with Mrs. Chiang, appreciating flowers, playing checkers, and strolling down the street. Sometimes she goes for a walk alone with her maid, or goes to the street to see the scenery and buy some small trinkets.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marshall is not only a capable wife, but also a talented and versatile writer. She often writes and reads in her spare time, and helps her husband organize documents.</p>
<p>Kindness, friendliness, democracy, and generosity are all reasons why many people admire and respect Mrs. Marshall. Everyone who has worked for her praises her for her good treatment of people. She treats people of all classes – upper, middle, and lower – equally. If the attendants around her make a mistake, she not only doesn’t scold them, but also gives them encouragement and comfort. No wonder the people around her say: "Even a very bad person will become a good person if they work by her side." Do you know to what extent she cares about her subordinates? If she asks them why they only ate two slices of toast for breakfast, she will immediately force them to eat all the breakfast she is eating, and wait for the cook to make another portion for herself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marshall treats her maid with extra care, treating her like a friend, often talking and chatting with her, telling her stories from her childhood, and even telling her how she and Mr. Marshall got married, and all the happy circumstances of their honeymoon. Speaking of this maid, she is a simple woman in her thirties, who speaks Shanghai dialect and can also speak better English than pidgin English. The maid envies Mrs. Marshall for having such a good husband, and people envy the maid for having such a good mistress.</p>
<p>We cannot deny that a husband's gains, losses, success, and failure are often greatly influenced by his wife. The reason why Mr. Marshall has five stars shining on his shoulders is that his wife's contribution cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>The First Grand Concert in the Capital After the Return to Nanjing: General Marshall and the U.S. Ambassador Attended and Were Greatly Appreciative</h3>
<p>— Reporter Pu Dejie, Dispatch from Nanjing, July 25th</p>
<p>On the evening of July 24th, the desolate and deserted gate of the National Assembly Hall suddenly became lively again. Large cars, small cars, jeeps, and pedicabs were densely packed on both sides of the wide road. Inside and outside the hall's lobby, the lights were bright, and ladies were as numerous as clouds. Many well-dressed gentlemen and ladies were smiling and talking; some wore orange silk ribbons, indicating they were hosts; some held elegant invitation cards, indicating they were guests. Starting from eight o'clock, they swept away the bad luck that had surrounded this magnificent building for the past few months.</p>
<p>(1) Overflowing with Joy</p>
<p>This was the first grand concert in Nanjing after the return to the capital, and the first time the National Assembly Hall had been filled with joy after the victory. The performance featured high-class classical music, and the guests invited were important figures and cultured individuals from Nanjing. Everything was high society and everyone displayed elegant manners.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the hall was beautiful. Gentlemen and ladies sat in comfortable spring seats, greeting acquaintances politely. Hostesses greeted guests and directed them to their assigned seats. Everyone spoke softly, walked softly, and gently pointed out the simple yet grand decorations and furnishings on the stage. A large purple-red velvet curtain hung down from the high stage opening, shimmering with light. On it were two rows of words cut from white paper: "Organized by the Central Propaganda Department of the Central Cultural Movement Committee" and "Musical Performance." Another row had the English names of the two organizing bodies. In the center was a dazzling and mysterious, faintly silvery-purple harp, and two narcissus flowers were arranged on either side. At the bottom was a row of English names: "Musical Visiting Group." In the center of the stage was a black grand piano, and two deep yellow velvet-cushioned chairs. On the stage opening were six flower baskets full of carnations and roses, arranged symmetrically. In a word, it was a beautiful stage setting. When the music began, people would forget all the troubles outside this building.</p>
<p>(2) Director's Speech</p>
<p>The chief guest was Marshal Marshall, who arrived at the venue at 8:40 PM. He was immediately invited to the upstairs lounge by the host. By this time, most of the seats in the venue were occupied. The old guard of the party and the officials of the government mostly sat on the right, while the figures of the Youth Party, the Communist Party, and the Democratic League were mostly on the left. Many envoys from friendly countries came, and many people from the cultural world also came. The reporters were quite active, but everyone understood that in this situation, it was best not to mention those difficult topics, because everyone was looking at the stage, waiting to hear beautiful music.</p>
<p>At 8:50 PM, Chairman Zhang Daofan of the Cultural Movement Committee, delivered a speech on behalf of the hosts. He sincerely thanked the landlords and performers for their kindness, and also thanked the guests for their presence. He said that he hoped that this visit abroad by the visiting group would show the achievements of China's new music to friendly countries and overseas Chinese, and at the same time, it could bring back the techniques of Western music to beautify and purify China's music. Finally, he politely apologized to everyone that the air-conditioning equipment of the hall was not yet installed, causing everyone to feel hot. But in fact, it was a very cool and pleasant evening!</p>
<p>(3) Music Begins</p>
<p>At 8:55 PM, the lights in the hall dimmed. The hall was pitch black for a short period of time. At the same time, there was not even a slight sound of footsteps or conversation. The lighting lamp on the right lit up first, followed by the one on the lower left, and then the one on the left. Millions of lines of sight were focused on the stage. Mr. Ma Sicong walked out of the curtain seam on the left, wearing a white shirt, a white flower bow tie, a white suit jacket, dark green trousers, and white leather shoes. His youthful, bright eyes and polite demeanor earned him applause. Following him were pianist Ms. Ma Sisun and another lady to take care of the sheet music, wearing the same green floral cheongsam and white shoes. The music began with two violin pieces by Mr. Ma Sicong. "Nostalgia" was gentle and tender, causing many people to lower their heads and close their eyes; "Spinning Tune" was joyful and lively, reminding people of the famous "Hungarian Dance." The first program ended with applause.</p>
<p>(4) Soprano Solo</p>
<p>The second program was tenor solo by Mr. Huang Yuanyin. In addition to wearing a black bow tie, his attire was the same as Mr. Ma's. With a short stature and a broad chest, he looked like a singer at first glance. He sang three songs in a row, each earning applause. His tone was very beautiful, his range was wide, and his emotional expression was well-honed. Especially the third song, "Tosca! Aria," made people believe that if the composer Puccini, the ancient Italian composer of the seventeenth century, could be resurrected to listen to this song, he would definitely shake hands with him.</p>
<p>The third program was a piano solo by Ms. Wu Leyi. She wore a light rose-red silk cheongsam with large white and dark purple flowers and white shoes. Her appearance aroused applause. She smiled and sat in front of the piano with the lid already open, tried a few notes, and then began to play. Her ten fingers jumped lightly and skillfully on the keys, playing three famous pieces: Rachmaninoff's "Prelude in G Minor," Albeniz's "Cordova," and Lecuona's "Malaguena." Accompanying the sonorous piano sounds was enthusiastic applause. A little girl presented a bouquet of flowers. In the applause, Ms. Wu smiled and accepted it, and repeatedly thanked the guests. This was at 9:35 PM. The first half of the program was over, and it was intermission time.</p>
<p>(5) Marshal's Interest</p>
<p>At this moment, Ambassador Stuart and Mr. Fu Jingbo arrived. They went upstairs. After the ambassador shook hands with the special envoy, he sat in the second row on the left. Special Envoy Marshall was very interested in music. He applauded and praised after each program. His seat changed from the first row to the fourth row and the fifth row, but always on the right side. In addition, upstairs were Ambassador Petrov, Mr. and Mrs. Shao Lizi, President Long Yun, and several hosts, as well as some socialite ladies – most of them took silk fans and asked the special envoy to sign his name. The special envoy smiled and listened quietly.</p>
<p>The ten-minute intermission passed, and the program started again. Mr. Huang Yuanyin sang three more Chinese songs: Mr. Zhao Yuanren's "How Can I Not Think of Her," Mr. Xia Zhiqiu's "Nostalgia," and Mr. Huang Zi's posthumous work "Family Ethics." These three lyrical songs with distinct emotions, which everyone knew, were warmly welcomed. Especially "Nostalgia," it made many listeners lower their heads. In this magnificent and splendid place, it aroused a trace of thoughts, making many people think of their hometowns that they could not return to; needless to say, this song caused a great applause. The fifth program was a piano solo. Ms. Wu used her exquisite and skilled technique to first play Chopin's "Berceuse." This great Polish musician, like Mozart, had experienced all kinds of suffering in his short, genius-filled years, but wrote only beautiful and joyful songs. This was a happy and peaceful song, making people feel the coming of angels, indulging in silent peace, so that everyone forgot to applaud at the end of the song. Next, she played Liszt's "Rigoletto-Paraphrase," and she ended her program in a storm of applause.</p>
<p>(6) Violin Solo</p>
<p>The sixth program, and also the last program, was another violin solo by Mr. Ma Sicong. Schubert's "Ave Maria" and Kreisler's "Tambourin Chinois." These two songs allowed the violinist to fully express his skills. The fluency of the latter and the distantness of the former were precisely a contrast. Mr. Ma easily portrayed them separately. Especially the double strings in the second half of "Ave Maria" were enough to be compared with Ma Sicong. "Chinese Flower Drum" is a violin piece that has been beautified and purified from folk songs, but it only retains a small amount of Chinese folk flavor. It seems that this kind of work of extracting the essence of folk art and reproducing it still needs to be done by ourselves.</p>
<p>At 10:20 PM, the program ended, and the guests left one after another, each with a satisfied smile on their lips. Indeed, it was a quite successful concert. Several young artists will have a bright future.</p>
<p>The traffic in front of the National Assembly Hall gradually dispersed, and everything returned to tranquility, but on this night, several sounds of different emotions were echoing in my ears: the gentleness and resentment of "Nostalgia," the piety and prayer of "Ave Maria," the peace and happiness of "Berceuse"..., I saw pictures emerging in front of my eyes, from suffering to happiness. I hope this is a lucky portrayal of the tortured compatriots who were temporarily forgotten in the magnificent and joyful venue.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of London</h3>
<p>— London Airmail of July 21st, Special Correspondent Xueyan for This Newspaper</p>
<p>From today onwards, bread in the entire United Kingdom can no longer be freely purchased. Each person can only buy within their allocated ration. Approximately six slices per person per day will be allowed, with corresponding fixed amounts for other flour-based products like noodles. According to some British newspapers, Britain's food situation is now the most difficult in the white world. It's unexpected that bread, which was exempt from rationing during the war, is now subject to strict restrictions a year after the war ended. Because this new system affects everyone in the country, interest is very widespread. Every household discusses it, and newspapers feature it with large headlines every day. Opposition party members are using this as good material for party strife, taking every opportunity to prove the Labor Party's incompetence. They always imply, "Look, the Conservative Party could solve the problem during wartime, but the Labor Party can't even handle it during peacetime." The Conservative Party newspapers naturally add fuel to the fire, constantly reminding the people of the government's weakness. After the news of the decision to implement bread rationing spread, the most flustered were the bakers. They formed groups and requested to see the Minister of Food to lodge a serious protest. However, all the minister could do was politely explain and frankly point out the scarcity of food reserves and the global prevalence of famine, saying that it was like "a clever housewife cannot cook without rice." The government's decision to implement rationing was a last resort, and it would be canceled as soon as the situation improved. Another group of people who are uneasy are the ladies and housewives who manage the household affairs. They have also formed the British Housewives' League and often go to argue with the Ministry of Food. The actual amount of food reserves in Britain has always been a secret. Some people speculate that it is enough for at least a year. However, recent circumstances have forced the truth to be revealed. It is said that there are only eight weeks of food reserves left. It is still uncertain where the supply will come from after eight weeks, so implementing rationing is truly a necessary measure.</p>
<p>Successful Loan</p>
<p>On the eve of implementing bread rationing, the successful acquisition of a nearly four billion US dollar loan from the United States gave people a glimmer of hope for improving living conditions. It passed smoothly in the House of Commons and has now been signed by the US President, becoming a formal law that can be implemented immediately. The government has already carefully planned the steps for utilizing this loan. It is said that most of it will be used to purchase machinery and parts to accelerate production, while only a small portion will be used to improve living conditions, with food and printed materials like paper being prioritized. The Chancellor of the Exchequer put it well, "This loan gives the British people a chance to breathe. It should be seen as a springboard for restoring prosperity, not a sofa for comfortably enjoying the fruits of labor." Here, we should note that Britain is the most on track and fastest-recovering country among the major powers after the war. It cannot be measured by our country's domestic standards. Even the United States, a country with abundant resources, is experiencing continuous labor strikes, making its industrial recovery slower than Britain's. According to the Overseas Trade Department's report, Britain's export trade has not only exceeded expectations but also surpassed pre-war levels. Currently, Britain's situation is that life is relatively difficult domestically, and it is vigorously promoting its products abroad to compete for the still unstable post-war world market. This loan from the United States further accelerates its expansion of overseas trade. However, unfortunately, the day the loan was obtained also coincided with a surge in US prices. It is said that from the day the loan was agreed upon until the day it was approved by the US House of Representatives, US prices have risen by approximately 30%, which means that the real value of the loan has fallen by approximately 30%. If the prices are low on the day the debt is repaid, then Britain's intangible losses will be significant. Therefore, the British government is not planning to use most of this loan during this period of high prices. It plans to use only a quarter of it, about one billion US dollars, this year, and wait for a better time for the rest. Although this loan is now in hand, the negotiation process was tortuous and difficult. While the United States knew that Britain needed help and was willing to lend, it clearly saw this loan as part of a policy to develop world trade, attacking Britain's imperial preference and the sterling bloc as conditions for the loan. Therefore, the negotiations took a long time, and there were several times when there was a danger of breakdown. Lord Keynes, the genius of British economics, is said to have died from overwork while negotiating this loan. Even after reaching an agreement with the US administrative authorities, there were several times when there was a danger of being rejected during the legislative process. The US government almost used all its strength to support its safe passage. Therefore, while the British government is full of hope for this loan to alleviate its current predicament, it is not entirely dependent on it. It is said that after agreeing to the loan, the British Treasury immediately began preparing two parallel plans for either success or failure of the loan, the latter of which was abandoned only after the US House of Representatives approved the loan.</p>
<p>Enlightened Measures</p>
<p>Although the British mainland is small, it is the oldest and largest empire in the world. Its colonies are all over the world, and most of Africa is its property. However, this empire has been able to stand firm because it has its strengths, namely, it can often recognize the trends of the times and prevent hidden dangers before they occur. For example, since the Labor Party came to power this time, it has implemented socialism within the country to eliminate the differences between the rich and the poor. At the same time, it also has a set of enlightened measures for the colonies. For example, the recent plan to allow India to become independent and help it form an autonomous government is the most obvious example. Other examples include allowing the withdrawal of troops stationed in Egypt and granting independence to Transjordan, all of which are manifestations of this enlightened trend. Although we also know that the independence granted by Britain is practically no different from the status of a colony, it is still a step forward. Recently, because the Labor Party has been in power for a full year, a debate on colonial policy was specially held in Parliament. This was the first time since the Labor Party came to power, and both the opposition party and the government party were very enthusiastic. In addition to the post-war colonial military service demobilization, post-war construction, and a set of post-war policy clichés, both sides paid attention to the issue of improving the lives of the people in the colonies. Because the lives of the people in the colonies are difficult and cannot be compared with Europeans, they have become two completely different worlds, and they have reached a point where they cannot develop on their own. There were many improvement measures mentioned in Parliament that day, but two things were most noteworthy in the speech delivered by its Colonial Secretary Hall: (1) A bill called the Colonial and Welfare Development Act, which had already been passed last year, allocated 210 million pounds over ten years specifically for improving the welfare of the people in the colonies. It stipulated that 230 million pounds would be used specifically for improving higher education. The British Colonial Department governs a population of approximately 50 million (India does not belong to the Colonial Department). On average, each person will benefit by more than four pounds within ten years. Although the amount is very small, it is better than nothing, and it is believed that this money will definitely benefit the people in the colonies without any problems. (2) To promote the organization of trade unions in the colonies. The main reason why the people in the colonies live in hardship is that the cost of labor is low. They work hard all year round but still do not have enough to eat and keep warm. All the gains from their labor are plundered by others. Therefore, organizing labor and making them strive to improve their lives is the most fundamental way. The Labor Party started by this, so it naturally did not forget to use this set of methods. It is now said that it has sent the most experienced people to the colonies to start organizing. It is hoped that there will be achievements in the future. Although there are new ideas in other political and construction aspects, there are no major characteristics.</p>
<p>Political Propaganda</p>
<p>People in politics pay attention to propaganda. How the power and effectiveness of propaganda actually are is difficult to estimate, but there is absolutely no question about how glaring propaganda can be. Since the British Labor Party has been in power, many party members have always wanted to use the opportunity of their current power to improve their propaganda position within the country. The issue of amending the charter of the British Broadcasting Corporation has been going on for almost a year, and there is still no final conclusion. According to a recent statement by the British Lord President of the Council, Morrison, the intention is to appoint a committee including all the major parties to investigate where the company's charter should be amended, but the results of the investigation will be considered when the charter expires next time. For the time being, the original charter will be allowed to be extended for five years (expiring at the end of December this year.) The British Broadcasting Corporation is a government-licensed monopoly broadcasting company. Its charter was issued by the government and began in 1926. It has been twenty years since then. Although the company's business has changed greatly now and in the past, the charter provisions are generally the same.</p>
<p>Recently, some people in the Labor Party have also paid attention to the newspaper issue, believing that the shares of current newspapers are in the hands of a few people, which is suspected of monopolizing and being biased, and losing the original intention of public opinion fairness. The government should conduct investigations and improvements. Currently, the newspaper with the most power in Britain is the Times. This newspaper has extremely high standards, but its circulation is not large, and its arguments are relatively fair. The newspapers with the widest circulation are the Daily Express (daily circulation of more than 3.7 million copies) and the Daily Mail, both of which are run by the Conservative Party, but they focus on social news, and their political influence is not great. The left-wing newspapers are the Daily Herald, which is the Labor Party's party newspaper, the Daily Worker, which is the Communist Party's party newspaper, and the News Chronicle, which, although a Liberal Party newspaper, is also slightly left-leaning. According to neutral statistics, although the total circulation of left-wing newspapers currently does not catch up with the right-wing, the difference between the two totals is not too large. Moreover, even when right-wing newspapers have a sales advantage, the election results are not affected, which shows that the effectiveness of propaganda is not as great as imagined. The problem is that the ruling party feels uncomfortable when enemy newspapers launch attacks. It is said that in the past, when MacDonald and Churchill were prime ministers, they both had the same feelings and plans, but after careful consideration, they were not implemented. Therefore, it is hoped that the Labor Party can maintain this tradition after taking power. The main condition of democratic politics is that the ruling party can tolerate criticism and accept criticism. Therefore, although this issue has now been raised by some members of the Labor Party, it is feared that it will not be supported by the government and is unlikely to pass. However, it shows that many members of the Labor Party have this tendency.</p>
<h3>Three Things in Shenyang: Horse Manure, Garbage, and Water and Electricity</h3>
<p>— Airmail of July 26th from This Newspaper, Special Correspondent Han Qingtao for the Northeast</p>
<p>Shenyang lacks electricity, so trams cannot run. Gasoline is scarce, and automobiles are also limited, so horse-drawn carts, handcarts, and tricycles are popular. On the main roads, the "clippety-clop" of horses' hooves can be heard every day from morning to night, making it impossible to relax. In addition, it has created a phenomenon of "horse manure all over the streets, and the stench of manure rising with the wind."</p>
<p>Horse Manure All Over the Streets</p>
<p>Reporters from the inland areas often report this matter to various places. The first impression people have when they come to Shenyang is also about horse-drawn carts and horse manure, which makes Mayor Dong Wenqi anxious and the municipal health personnel busy. Someone came up with a solution to order the cart owners to hang an iron bucket behind each horse's buttocks, but there was still a lot of horse manure because the manure could not completely fall into the bucket, and the cart drivers often secretly dumped the manure that fell into the bucket on the street.</p>
<p>More than 11,000 horse-drawn carts and iron handcarts run on the streets, and more than 700 street sweepers from the city government sweep the streets every day. Not only has the problem of horse manure not been rationally resolved, but also the roads, which are related to horses' hooves and cart wheels, have also become "uneven."</p>
<p>Automobiles and Trams</p>
<p>After several months of effort, this annoying matter has finally made some progress. That is, the city government has repaired six automobiles, which run on the road from Dongguan to the Zhongchang Road Station. It is possible to collect and repair 25 to 30 broken automobiles from the suburbs by August, and there will be more passengers.</p>
<p>Shenyang has a total of six tram lines, with a total length of 35 kilometers and more than 30 trams. 17 of them have now been repaired. It has been decided to start 12 of them on August 1st. The electricity used is supplied by the Ordnance Factory, where 700 to 800 kilowatts of electricity can be sent out. Trams will run during the day and provide lighting for the main streets at night.</p>
<p>In this way, the problem of transportation for most of the residents in the city has been largely solved. Horse-drawn carts and large carts will be banned from carrying passengers in the urban area. The city government's plan is to call on them to develop in the rural areas. This will not only facilitate the transportation between the urban and rural areas, but also solve most of the horse manure problem. On the other hand, it will encourage them to go to Fushun to transport coal, in order to solve the coal shortage in winter.</p>
<p>30,000 Tons of Garbage</p>
<p>Along with horse manure, the "garbage problem" is also uncomfortable. This matter not only damages environmental hygiene and affects the health of citizens, but also pollutes the city's appearance. According to the Health Bureau's investigation, there are currently 109 large piles of garbage, with a volume of about 40,000 cubic feet and a weight of more than 30,000 tons.</p>
<p>Mayor Dong said: This is a heavy burden on his shoulders. In addition to the fundamental solution, he decided to hold a three-day city-wide clean-up in Shenyang from July 29th, mobilizing all citizens to participate in this activity. In addition, he has agreed with the Commander-in-Chief's Office to allocate 20 trucks to start transporting garbage outwards from densely populated areas and gradually expand the clean-up work.</p>
<p>In terms of the fundamental solution, it has been decided to repair the damaged gas factory. The machinery is currently being repaired, and it is expected that three plants will be repaired by the end of September, which can supply about 10,000 households for cooking. This can reduce the gradual increase of garbage. It is heard that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is using the "work-for-food" method to allocate flour and funds, totaling about 6.9 million yuan, to solve many of the city government's economic difficulties in cleaning up garbage and repairing the gas factory.</p>
<p>Clean Water Does Not Flow Out</p>
<p>The "water" needed for the city's main drinking and cleaning purposes is also a problem. In the urban area, most people use the so-called "foreign wells" to fetch water, and some places draw water from old-fashioned large wells, so the problem is small. The problem lies in the Heping District, because the tap water facilities have mostly become decorations, and many water pipes have not flowed water for a long time.</p>
<p>People living upstairs have to carry water up to the upper floors bucket by bucket, and the excrement in the flush toilets also has to be flushed with water. In many places, the toilets are stinking. The reporter stayed in a hospital that had such a situation. All hygiene facilities have lost their effectiveness because there is no water.</p>
<p>The water source for Shenyang has only been completely restored at the moment, but because of insufficient electricity, only the Beiling, Wanquan, and Shasan water sources can supply electricity for five or six hours a day, and the total water supply is less than 10,000 tons, which is less than one-seventh of the previous water supply. The Tawan water source will also be opened in the near future. In addition, it is planned to build another water source in Tiexi to increase the water supply. It is also planned to discuss with the Changchun Railway Bureau to allocate its water sources to Shenyang for use, so that everyone can enjoy "like a fish in water" when the electricity is sufficient.</p>
<p>Electricity Is the Key</p>
<p>Water, manure, and garbage all directly or indirectly require electricity. Electricity is related to the entire Shenyang's recovery of health, as well as its future development and prosperity. The thermal power plants in Fushun and parts of Shenyang can only solve a small part of the supply. The city government is currently planning to buy several electric motors of more than 300 horsepower from Japan to help with the emergency.</p>
<p>The power source for Shenyang from the Yalu River has no hope of being transmitted. Although the Xiaofengman power plant in Jilin is in the hands of the National Army, the transmission line passes through a small part of the Communist Army's area, such as the line north of Meihekou—from Chaoyang Town to Panshi—and the south of Meihekou—Shancheng Town to Qingyuan. According to Wang Yuxin, the leader of the Commander-in-Chief's Power Supply Repair Team, many power transmission line towers south of Meihekou have been destroyed by the Communist Army. At the same time, he also personally saw them carrying out planned destruction operations. The Xiaofengman power source cannot be sent south, which has caused a surplus of power north of Siping Street.</p>
<p>When Lin Biao, representing Li Lisan, arrived in Shenyang, reporters asked him about the transmission of electricity from Xiaofengman to Shenyang. He said, "It is a small problem," but everyone earnestly hopes that this small problem can be resolved as soon as possible so that factories can be revived and people can have a good life.</p>
<h3>Small News from Lushan</h3>
<p>— Airmail from Guling for This Newspaper, Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu</p>
<p>On the day Marshal Marshall went up the mountain for the second time, Chairman Chiang and his wife personally went to the street to buy two green porcelain ducks, each more than an inch long, to give to Marshal and Mrs. Marshall for their enjoyment. These ducks are small and exquisite, and Marshal and Mrs. Marshall were extremely happy to receive them. It is said that the two ducks cost a total of 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 28th, Chairman Chiang felt slightly unwell, with a slight fever and chills, but he still attended the Summer Camp Commemorative Week and the opening ceremony of the Jiangxi Summer Academic Lecture Series the next day despite his illness. After returning to his residence, he followed his doctor's orders and needed to rest. On this day, his wife was always at his service and did not go out all day, not even into the garden.</p>
<p>Reporters from various newspapers in Lushan, in addition to being nervous about reporting news all day, have also developed a great interest in photography. Some bring their own cameras, while others borrow them. Once the results are developed, everyone competes to visit and exclaim "Excellent, excellent!" or "What a pity, what a pity."</p>
<p>A foreigner lives in the Hujin Fang Hotel who does not speak Chinese. Before every meal, he buries himself and laboriously flips through his English-Chinese bilingual dictionary. However, after fumbling for a long time, he still cannot say what he wants to eat. Even if he says it, the Jiangxi waiters still do not understand. But he is almost starving. As a last resort, the waiters can only ask the reporters to be temporary interpreters. Fortunately, this gentleman is waiting for a boat and will go down the mountain to Xunyang and then to Shanghai soon. Otherwise, he would be racking his brains every day, which would really defeat the purpose of going up the mountain for rest.</p>
<p>The police here have a very "leisurely" style. There are not many pedestrians on the street, and there are very few fights. There are no rickshaw licenses to pry and no paralyzed vendors to drive away. They only stand guard and stand at attention when important people go up the mountain.</p>
<p>Liang Hancao is very interested in poetry. On the day he climbed the mountain, he recited a poem to a friend, which was written nine years ago. The poem says: "Exploring the Five Elders up the Yangtze River again, still difficult when climbing, the sinking boat in the East China Sea, a past regret, rowing in the middle stream, profound at this moment. Green trees along the river grow lush, floating clouds cover the sun, illusory and sunny, thunder and lightning wait for tomorrow, impatience, sigh ten thousand horses of disease." (30th)</p>

<h3>Another Step Towards Relief for Refugees</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zheng</p>
<p>Recently, government authorities and social elites have been tirelessly appealing for and providing funds and food to the refugees from Northern Jiangsu, doing their utmost to provide relief. Those who benefit should naturally sing praises and be eternally grateful. Why, then, do complaints persist, even to the point of wishing for the demise of the current situation?</p>
<p>I have investigated the actual situation. Among the refugees, some have fled individually, while others have left with their entire families. Food, clothing, and shelter are consistently scarce. While those providing relief exert immense effort, those receiving it still feel like they are only getting a drop in the bucket. Moreover, in Northern Jiangsu in the past six months, violent mobs have seized power, advocating for the overturning of the existing order, using liquidation as a pretext, and instigating struggles. The lives and property of the people are completely unprotected, and freedom of speech and assembly is entirely lost. Those elders, siblings, and relatives who remain trapped in the fallen territory are reportedly being imprisoned for minor offenses and unjustly labeled as counter-revolutionaries. They are using old, unfounded grudges from ten or twenty years ago to ruin families, calling on tenant farmers to refuse rent and return grain, thereby seizing landlords' property. If that is not enough, they dismantle their houses and carry away their furniture, determined to strip landlords of all their possessions before they are satisfied. Those who served as heads of townships or Baojia (self-governing units) before 1940 are being detained and punished without exception. Middle peasants, wealthy peasants, middle merchants, wealthy merchants, as well as educated youths and local leaders who are not part of their faction are being framed and eliminated en masse. They are calling on young women to join the Women's Federation and forcibly comfort soldiers. Reports of those who would rather die than suffer humiliation and lose their honor are heard daily. Other tragic events, such as wearing tall hats, donning dog skins, carrying turtle shells, dragging tails, licking buttocks, and being tied up for public display, are constantly emerging in countless variations. All these things are heart-wrenching to hear and heartbreaking to see. The chaos of Huang Chao's rebellion and the brutality of Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong were not this cruel. Relief organizations cannot fully solve the refugees' problems of food, clothing, and shelter, and even if they could, they still cannot alleviate the inner suffering of those who cannot return home, whose families are scattered, and who still endure the hellish existence in their villages. Therefore, their complaints and curses, as well as the previous assault in Xiaguan, driven by righteous indignation, seem understandable and not surprising.</p>
<p>The government halts fighting and then halts it again, negotiates for peace and then negotiates again, merely wasting time with little effect, while the refugees are becoming increasingly anxious and furious. Moreover, the prolonged stationing of troops is difficult to sustain, and the constant advances and retreats only demoralize the soldiers. Now, the Communist troops in Northern Jiangsu, in their treasonous attack on Taizhou, Taixing, and Jingjiang, have suffered setbacks. Zhou Enlai is about to travel and advocate for peace again, rehashing old tunes. If the government considers protecting and nurturing the people its responsibility, it should enforce national discipline and order the rebel troops of the New Fourth Army, whose designation was revoked long ago, to withdraw from Northern Jiangsu and relocate to designated areas, reform the style of violent mob rule, and await government reorganization, so that political and military orders are unified, internal strife is eliminated, and the nation is built together. Otherwise, if the New Fourth Army continues to disrupt the region, harming the people at will, their rebellious actions are evident, and the government should immediately condemn and suppress the rebellion, preventing it from spreading. This is a matter of military order and discipline, not a political party dispute.</p>
<h3>Military Vehicle Injures Someone and Flees</h3>
<p>This morning at 8:30 AM, I hired a rickshaw from my residence on North Sichuan Road to go to the Central Bank on the Bund. While passing East Baoxing Road, I was suddenly knocked down by a military vehicle coming from behind. Both I and the rickshaw puller were knocked unconscious. By the time passersby helped us up, the military vehicle had already sped away. Upon inspection, my clothes were completely torn, worth about 100,000 yuan, and my flesh was severely injured. The rickshaw puller also suffered serious injuries, and the rickshaw was completely destroyed. The driver of the vehicle was devoid of conscience and public morality, fleeing the scene after causing the accident. My injuries and the loss of my clothes are minor matters, but the rickshaw puller's injuries and the need to compensate the rickshaw company for the loss are tragic. Recently, the city has become increasingly crowded, and traffic order is becoming more and more chaotic. Accidents are bound to occur several times a day. If the authorities do not pay attention and remedy the situation, the consequences will be unimaginable. (Yu Gongyue)</p>
<h3>Distinguishing Rottenness and Magic</h3>
<p>After reading the article "Transforming Rottenness into Magic" published in your column, I have some humble opinions to offer. We cannot simply lament the waste of valuable materials in garbage without considering that the cost of sorting and transforming "rottenness" into "magic" might outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>Consider concentrating two thousand tons of garbage in one place. The transportation costs alone would be considerable. Furthermore, if sorted and selected manually, each person could handle, at most, half a ton per day. Two thousand tons would require four thousand people. If each person is paid 2,000 yuan per day (which seems quite meager), then it would cost 8 million yuan per day, and this does not include the cost of packaging and transportation. With 50% of the garbage being coal ash and dust, and 20% being melon rinds and fruit peels, it is unlikely that one could "produce" several million yuan per day. Moreover, Shanghai's garbage has already been sorted once or twice by small beggars while still in the bins, and anything that can be turned into money has already been transformed into "magic," so there is no need to wait until it is concentrated to be discovered.</p>
<p>In these years of soaring prices and scarce resources, "magical" things in garbage are likely rare. And once large-scale sorting begins, unless it is done ten kilometers away from Shanghai, it will inevitably lead to a stench and a swarm of flies. While DDT can kill insects, the expenses will likely increase. (Wang Zhaopei)</p>

<h3>Reviving Guangdong's Sericulture Industry</h3>
<p>— He Zhiduan</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Agriculture is the main cornerstone of the province's economy. Among agricultural investments, the capital turnover of the sericulture industry is the fastest. Among agricultural products of the same unit weight, the price of raw silk is the highest. During the peak period of the sericulture industry, over three million people, accounting for more than one-tenth of the province's population, relied on it for their livelihood. Although the province exports many special products, their total economic value is still less than the income from raw silk exports during their peak. Most of the time, there is an import surplus, which relies on raw silk exports to make up the difference. In total, from 1912 to 1932, the province exported 1,052,000 bales of raw silk, averaging about 50,070 bales per year, with each bale weighing 80 catties net. 1922 saw 66,900 bales, the highest record. 1931 saw 34,320 bales, the lowest record. From 1933 to the start of the War of Resistance, annual exports were only about 20,000 bales, and the price dropped sharply, becoming worse and worse! After the main silk-producing areas fell to the enemy, the Japanese invaders exhausted their brutal control and plundering. They also established the "East Asia Flat Cocoon Company" and flat cocoon factories in Shunde, forcing silkworm farmers to produce flat cocoons. The finished products were controlled and purchased by the company for the manufacturing of military supplies. Many local silkworm farmers and silk factories changed their professions to growing sugarcane and producing sugar. The province's sericulture industry has become increasingly depressed. "Shunde as Guangdong's bank" has become a historical cliché!</p>
<p>II. Raising Reconstruction Funds</p>
<p>1. Sources of funding for publicly run sericulture organizations:</p>
<p>A. From the agricultural and forestry authorities themselves: Each department of agriculture and forestry is important, but there are varying degrees of benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the implementation of agricultural and forestry construction work should also be prioritized. The funding for less important agricultural and forestry departments can be reduced to the minimum to meet the maximum funding needs of more important agricultural and forestry departments. Sericulture is an important agricultural and forestry sector in this province, and the budget allocated for its construction should be larger. Otherwise, agricultural and forestry construction will be scattered and superficial, difficult to provide practical benefit.</p>
<p>B. From the central authorities: The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have established the China Sericulture Company, demonstrating the authorities' determination to revive the sericulture industry. However, the company's focus seems to be in the Central China region, and it may not be able to reach this province. Therefore, it seems necessary to allocate additional funds to subsidize the development of the sericulture industry in this province.</p>
<p>C. From the Guangdong branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (RRA): Director Ling Daoyang is an agricultural expert, and Mr. Liao Chongzhen, who holds important responsibilities in the administration, is the former director of the Sericulture Bureau of this province. The urgent need to rescue the sericulture industry in this province is self-evident! However, it should be discussed that the funds for rescuing the sericulture industry should be handed over to the agricultural and forestry authorities for unified management and utilization, which can save manpower and financial resources, improve work efficiency, and avoid redundant overlap.</p>
<p>D. From the Bureau of Requisitioned Enemy Assets: Enemy and puppet assets are scattered throughout the province and are a huge source of wealth. The authorities must have a comprehensive plan for their utilization. It is appropriate to take them from traitors and use them for recovery and national reconstruction. What do you think, wise gentlemen?</p>
<p>2. Sources of capital for privately run sericulture enterprises:</p>
<p>A. Foreign investment: Foreign countries find it difficult to develop the sericulture industry due to excessively high wages. For example, the United States is a silk-consuming country, and its geography and climate are quite suitable for planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms. However, it is limited by high wages and cannot develop. Although many people in that country advocate for the sericulture industry and have proposed solutions such as obtaining cheap labor from Mexico, it would be easier to transfer capital and invest in this province, where the sericulture industry already has some foundation and a large supply of low-wage labor.</p>
<p>B. Overseas Chinese investment: The prosperity of this province relies heavily on remittances from overseas Chinese. However, recently, overseas Chinese have been subject to strict remittance restrictions in foreign countries. Therefore, the return of large amounts of capital to the country still depends on the efforts of our diplomatic authorities.</p>
<p>C. Investment from the Guangdong Industrial Company: During the war, the investment area of the Guangdong Industrial Company was limited to the remote area of northern Guangdong. The types of enterprises invested in were mostly farms. At that time, due to environmental limitations, it was unable to consider operating the sericulture industry. Now that the homeland has been recovered, silk should account for a large proportion of the province's exports. Therefore, investing in the sericulture industry is very beneficial. If there is a shortage of capital and it is not possible to establish a larger-scale sericulture enterprise, then ways can be found to issue company shares as a method of raising funds.</p>
<p>D. Bank investment: During the War of Resistance, Guangdong banks invested in agriculture and forestry, such as cattle breeding farms and forest farms, scattered throughout northern Guangdong. In the future, it is believed that farsighted bankers will compete to invest in the sericulture industry, which has a fast capital turnover.</p>
<p>E. Encourage investment from urban floating capital: If urban capital is allowed to float freely, it can easily be transformed into speculative capital that affects people's livelihood. The sericulture industry is a permanent enterprise. Once this industry is promoted, agriculture, industry, and commerce will flourish. No matter how large the floating capital is, if it is properly encouraged, it can be absorbed into this enterprise.</p>
<p>F. Agricultural bank loans: Establish branches of the agricultural bank in towns and cities with convenient transportation in the original and expanded sericulture areas to provide loans to silkworm farmers. However, the loan procedures and operating regulations must be simple and clear, and prevent private speculation and fraud. Most of the silkworm farmers who need assistance are poor and ignorant. Therefore, agricultural and forestry guidance personnel must cooperate in advance to promote the information so that everyone knows. Thorough measures must be taken to benefit poor silkworm farmers. Otherwise, this type of loan is often used by landlords and local tyrants and does not benefit poor farmers.</p>
<p>To revive the sericulture industry, a large amount of financial resources is necessary, but the most important thing is the issue of how to use the financial resources. In other words, how to achieve the greatest effect with the least amount of capital to achieve the best economic results. I believe that there are three principles of operation: (1) Concentrated use, in two points: one, concentration of institutions. All financial resources used for reviving sericulture must be concentrated in a small number of institutions for unified distribution; second, concentration of departments. The agricultural and forestry construction departments are very broad and the financial resources are limited. Instead of distributing the financial resources equally among the construction of each department, it is better to focus on a few more important departments and seek to revive and develop them first. (2) Rapid use. Currently, prices are soaring and increasing. After obtaining funds, they must be used immediately to reduce the impact of price increases. (3) Material resource utilization. We can use ancestral halls and temples in the countryside for sericulture sites; we can use wind caves and mountain caves for various cold storage; we can use the rapid water power of the East River and North River as the original power of silk-making machinery; we can try to obtain machinery, instruments, and books for testing and research from Japan's compensation for our losses.</p>
<p>III. Establishing More Sericulture Sites</p>
<p>Looking back, during the war, the only organization responsible for improving the province's sericulture industry was the Sericulture Section of the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, with three external sites: (1) Lechang Mulberry and Silkworm Improvement Site, (2) Xijiang Mulberry and Silkworm Improvement Site, (3) Tiancan Test Site. After the restoration and up to the present, in addition to the original sites, the most important sites to be added are nurseries and silkworm seed farms. These two types of sites should be established according to the geographical distribution of the sericulture industry and be responsible for reproduction and promotion.</p>
<p>(1) Nursery: During the war, mulberry farmers in various regions switched to planting miscellaneous grains and sugarcane. Currently, more sensitive and prescient farmers already know how to start restoring their sericulture business, but many suffer from a lack of mulberry seedlings. Therefore, to restore and expand the area of mulberry fields, it is necessary to breed a large number of seedlings first. There are two types of mulberry seedlings in this province: Heshan variety and Datong variety. The latter is not drought-resistant and is suitable for low-lying, humid land. The former is drought-resistant and is suitable for dry farming in high-lying areas. For the sake of quickly achieving success, it may be expedient to choose varieties with less variation for mass propagation. As for other good varieties, such as Shi Ping Early-bearing, Jiuwenlong, Shizimonji, and Shufan, they can be propagated and promoted only after trial experiments of soil suitability and adaptability are carried out in the next step.</p>
<p>(2) Seed-producing farm: Currently, due to the reduced area of mulberry fields and the lack of mulberry leaves, it is difficult to raise silkworms on a large scale. However, good varieties can be selected and produced in areas with more abundant mulberry quantities, and promoted on a large scale. Silkworm seeds in this province are mostly multi-voltine, resistant to high temperatures and high humidity, have a short growth period, and the silk has a particularly strong luster. However, the breeds are impure, the quality is weak and prone to disease, the cocoons are thin and small, there is more floss silk, and reeling is more difficult. The silkworm seeds in Taizhou Province are used for the round month large production, and each silkworm seed paper (500 moths) yields about 150-200 catties of fresh cocoons. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, each silkworm seed paper (28 moths) can yield 30 catties of fresh cocoons. The cocoon yield of silkworm seeds in this province is less than half of that in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Therefore, this province urgently needs unified silkworm seeds that are high-yielding, have good silk quality, and are disease-free. The former Sericulture Bureau promoted the Bijiao variety, and the Xijiang Mulberry and Silkworm Improvement Site had the No. 258 variety. The No. 1 seed-producing farm was located in Rongqi, Shunde, and the No. 2 silkworm seed farm was located in Jiujiang, Nanhai. Now they have been greatly damaged. The Xijiang Mulberry and Silkworm Improvement Site has only the cold storage equipment remaining. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>An Overview of Industrial and Commercial Management</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>3. Good Friendship in All Aspects: There should be close contact with merchants who frequently do business. That way, when they have any news or suitable raw materials, they will let you know. Many people think that buying other people's goods is a superior position, and they must ensure that others do not get any profit, or get only a very small profit, to be satisfied. In fact, they damage each other's friendship because of this. When there is important news or suitable goods, others will not tell them, so it is easy to miss good opportunities.</p>
<p>4. Accurate Records: There should be accurate records of the various raw materials needed, their sources, and the required quantities. With these records, you can have very practical reference. In particular, there should be statistics on the amount of raw materials needed, so you can know the annual consumption. At the same time, there should also be accurate records of market price fluctuations so that you can refer to the past and look to the future.</p>
<p>When carrying out purchasing work, prices should be quoted by several parties and samples should be submitted for review. There is a Chinese saying, "Compare prices with three companies and you won't suffer a loss." It means that the price must be compared. The usual situation is to inquire about prices. If it is necessary to keep secrets, then the bidding method should be used. Several merchants who are willing to supply the goods should estimate the price, seal it tightly, and send it to the company. A date is set, and it is opened in public (called "opening bids"). Whoever offers the lowest price is awarded the contract or supplies the required raw materials (called "winning the bid").</p>

<h3>Imitation and Creation in Traditional Chinese Painting</h3>
<p>— Ying Yeping</p>
<p>Starting with Shi Tao's Treatise on Painting</p>
<p>"If you do not learn the ancient methods, you cannot establish your own; if you do not transform the ancient methods, you will never have your own. This is what is meant by the Shi Tao family style." These are a few lines from my colophon to Shi Tao's painting album several years ago, which I now use as the opening of this article. It can also be said to be the key to a painter's success.</p>
<p>Shi Tao was the most creative painter in the history of Chinese painting. In his painting precepts, we can cite several points that represent his thoughts. In the third chapter of his "Hua Yu Lu" (Painting Discourses), titled "Change," he says: "The ultimate man has no method; not that he has no method, but that having no method is the ultimate method… People say, 'So-and-so's texturing technique can be relied upon,' or 'Without resembling so-and-so's landscapes, one cannot be passed down for long,' or 'So-and-so's purity can establish one's character,' or 'Without resembling so-and-so's meticulousness, one is not enough to please people.' This is me being employed by so-and-so's family, not so-and-so's family being used by me. Even if I force myself to resemble so-and-so's family, I am only eating their leftovers. What is left for me?" In the seventh chapter, "Yin Yun" (Primordial Chaos), he says: "...When painting mountains, make them spirited; when painting water, make it dynamic; when painting forests, make them vibrant; when painting people, make them refined. Understand the harmony of brush and ink, comprehend the distinctions of yin and yang, create a new world from chaos, transmit it to future generations, and establish your own school. All of this is achieved through wisdom. Do not carve mechanically, do not become rigid and stale, do not sink into the mud, do not be entangled, do not be disjointed, do not be without reason. Establish your spirit in the sea of ink, determine life from the tip of your brush, exchange the rough form on the small canvas, and release light from the chaos. Even if the brush is not like a brush, the ink is not like ink, and the painting is not like a painting, I am still present." In the eighth chapter, "Mountains and Rivers," he says: "Measure the forms and shapes of mountains and rivers, gauge the vastness of the land, examine the density of peaks and ranges, and discern the obscurity of mist and clouds. Occupy a thousand miles upright, cast a sidelong glance at ten thousand layers, and unify them under the authority of Heaven and the balance of Earth. Heaven has this authority, capable of transforming the essence of mountains and rivers; Earth has this balance, capable of moving the vital energy of mountains and rivers; I have this single stroke, capable of penetrating the forms and spirits of mountains and rivers. This is why I have not broken away from mountains and rivers for fifty years, nor have I treated them as dregs, causing them to be selfish; mountains and rivers have made me speak on their behalf. Did mountains and rivers break away from me, or did I break away from mountains and rivers? Exhaustively search for strange peaks to make drafts, and mountains and rivers and I meet in spirit and transform in trace. Therefore, it ultimately returns to Great Purification." In the fourth chapter, "Reverence and Acceptance," he says: "A single stroke contains all things within it; painting receives ink, ink receives brush, brush receives wrist, and wrist receives heart, like the creation of Heaven and the formation of Earth. This is why it is received." In Shi Tao's painting inscriptions, there are words like these: "If one sees this path clearly, then one must release the brush and sweep directly, surveying thousands of peaks and ten thousand valleys in a single glance. It looks like startling lightning and rushing clouds, rising in masses. Is it Jing Guan? Is it Dong Ju? Is it Ni Huang? Is it Shen Zhao? Who can give it a name? I have often seen various famous artists who, at every turn, say they imitate so-and-so's style or follow so-and-so's school. Writing and painting are born of Heaven, and each person is in charge of the affairs of their own generation."</p>
<p>From the above arguments, it can be seen how Shi Tao was filled with a spirit of originality. Imitation and following are what Shi Tao most rejected. He was an extremely intelligent person, so he exaggerated his own creative theories and concealed the facts of imitation. He did not admit that his paintings were imitated from somewhere or that his brushwork was learned from somewhere. Only in this way could he show his genius and creativity. In fact, Shi Tao was not a born painter. His achievements were undoubtedly learned from the ancients. When we study his paintings, we should understand his origins and not be deceived and blinded by his theories without rational analysis and factual basis. Moreover, in his theories, it is not that he absolutely does not accept the legacy of the ancients. Now let me first find out his origins. I cannot speak blindly; I must also cite evidence. Only in this way can we avoid blindly following and find a real way out for those who study painting. His paintings are learned from Huang He Shan Qiao (i.e., Wang Shuming), and his brushwork is obtained from Shan Qiao in every stroke.</p>
<p>The winter before last, I saw Huang He Shan Qiao's "Secluded Residence in the Forest" at Wang Jiqian's house. The techniques include ox-hair and bean-like texture strokes, and moss dots have flying mosses in the face. Everything that Shi Tao boasted as creation and thought was the secret of Heaven and Earth's creation can be found in this painting. There are also many places where Shi Tao imitated Shan Qiao's "Hui Lu's Small Hermitage" and "Tea Brewing Picture". From this, it can be said that a painter cannot succeed without going through the stage of imitation. Shi Tao is the painter who is most able to imitate the ancients.</p>
<p>For example, when making a light bulb, if you do not understand the principle of how the initially invented five-candlepower bulb is constructed, it is practically impossible to improve it and make a one-hundred-candlepower bulb. Therefore, to improve, you must first understand the principles of past successes, and then you can have greater success. The imitation of painting is also the same: one must thoroughly understand the essence of the ancient masters. It is not enough to just look at collotype editions, copy some fake copies, and obtain their superficial resemblance. To give another shallow analogy:</p>
<p>A jar of mud-sealed wine, with a red paper label written in black characters, loudly proclaims "Vintage Hua Diao," followed by a large set of advertisements describing its color, aroma, and taste. But when the jar is opened, it is just a pool of clear water, leaving the saliva-dripping drinkers to only stare at the label in a daze. Can everyone admit that this is a jar of fine wine?</p>
<p>Therefore, imitation is not an easy task, and creation is even more difficult. Wang Lutai has the following saying about imitation: "Wen Zhengming, Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, Qiu Ying, and Dong Qichang, although they each use different brushstrokes, they all deliberately learn from the ancients, and they are actually breathing through the same nostrils. In recent times, the way of painting has been usurped, the ancient methods have gradually disappeared, and many people create their own new ideas. False seeds are spread, and they become evil and strange, beyond salvation." Wen Zhengming, Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, Qiu Ying, and Dong Qichang, who were cited by Lutai, are all great writers representing their times. Can we say that they have no creative ability? However, their creations all evolved from imitating the ancients. Therefore, the ancients said: "To study without learning from the ancients is like walking in the night without a fire." This is not wrong.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that imitation is the foundation of learning, and creation is the expression of success. Imitation is accepting the ancient masters' methods of using brush, ink, color, composition... It is not copying the ancient masters' compositions. This acceptance must be accepted through the author's consciousness and experience. I think this kind of "imitation" will not lead to the result of submerging one's personality and being confined by the ancients.</p>
<h3>On European Painting in the Last Hundred Years</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Independent European painting began with Giotto in Italy in the early 13th century. Generally speaking, he was a painter who was a precursor to the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Until recently, the history of European painting has only been over five hundred years. Compared with our Chinese painting, their development is naturally far more advanced than ours.</p>
<p>Why is European painting so developed, especially in the last hundred years? It is truly a meteoric rise. When we look at it, we cannot help but envy it. We often feel inferior or blame the artists for not working hard enough. This is actually unnecessary.</p>
<p>The development of painting is by no means a matter of painting and its artists alone. It should be recognized as a social matter. If we look at the development of European painting in the last hundred years, we can be even more convinced that this view is reasonable. It is by no means the result of painting being isolated from politics or religion. It should be recognized that the relationship between politics or religion and art has its inevitability.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution in England in 1764 was the beginning of changing the method of social production in Europe. Under this method of production, a new productive force and productive relations were formed. In painting, classicism was merely a dying echo of feudal politics. It was finally unable to resist the high tide of the bourgeois revolution. David followed the Napoleonic regime and disappeared. The so-called academic school was just the aftermath of classicism, and it was only natural that it was rejected.</p>
<p>Delacroix, who painted masterpieces such as "1830" and "Dante's Boat," was a painter full of revolutionary enthusiasm. Therefore, he enjoyed the reputation of a master of Romanticism. His achievements reflected the success of the French Revolution.</p>
<p>Millet and Courbet are painters who are called Realists. On the one hand, they wanted to escape reality, and on the other hand, they wanted to expose reality. This is the inevitable dilemma of artists in bourgeois society. This era also produced many landscape painters, and many people praised them because they purified painting. In fact, this is a wrong view.</p>
<p>Mature capitalist society will inevitably make science highly developed. The paintings of Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism, which praised sunlight and valued color, cannot be regarded as artists working for art's sake. It is an art that reflects the development of science.</p>
<p>From around the First European War to the Second World War, capitalism was highly developed, fully expressing the social characteristics of free competition and winning by surprise. Therefore, Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism... all kinds of paintings emerged. Everyone thinks that this is the development of pure painting because these arts do not talk about content, but only seek expression. We Chinese are still loudly shouting "The glory of Eastern art!" because European painters are also paying attention to lines and studying brushwork, clearly learning Eastern art, especially Chinese painting. In fact, if you close your eyes and think about it, Chinese painting was produced in a feudal society of agricultural production. The European society of the 20th century is not equal to Chinese society. How can the art of painting, as the superstructure of society, be the same? On the surface, it is glory, but what is the essence?</p>
<p>Now is the atomic age, and European painting will inevitably have a new development.</p>

<h3>Two Modern Sculptors - Sculpting Studio Notes</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>Rodin (A. Rodin 1840-1917), the revolutionary pioneer of modern sculpture, and Cézanne (Paul Cezanne 1839-1906) in the painting world, can be called the two great contributors to the modern art revolution. Moreover, he established the independent status of sculpture as "pure appreciative art."</p>
<p>Rodin was born in Paris, with a strong will and enthusiasm. His works were greatly influenced by Impressionism and had a particularly realistic style. He was good at capturing people's momentary emotions and dynamics. Therefore, his works are extremely vivid. "The Kiss," "The Thinker," "The Burghers of Calais," "Balzac," and "The Bronze Age" are all representative masterpieces of his life.</p>
<p>Nude Sculptor Mayol</p>
<p>Although Maillol (A. Maillol 1861) was Rodin's junior, his status and achievements in the modern French art world are not weaker than Rodin's. He deserves to be praised as a master of modern sculpture. He is still alive. His works have the good traditions of classicism. All the beautiful advantages and emotions of Greek, Egyptian, and even Eastern art are extracted by him and expressed in his own works with new techniques and new postures, such as "Harmonie," "Statuetteen Bois," "Pomone," etc. These are all carefully crafted masterpieces that are sufficient to represent him. Maillol followed the Impressionist nude painter Renoir (Auguste Renoir 1841-1919) in his youth and was greatly influenced by him. His paintings and sketches are in the style of Bi Shaw Lei. In 1909, he created a portrait for Renoir, which Renoir greatly appreciated and exclaimed, "This is simply my self-portrait!" This proves the style of Maillol and Renoir. They both paint and sculpt, and are both modern nude works, which can be called double heroes.</p>

<h3>The Arrangement Method of Landscape Painting (Continued from the manuscript of July 29)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Mingshi</p>
<p>In addition to the "person-shaped arrangement method," there are also the principles of vertical and horizontal, and emptiness and fullness. What is meant by vertical and horizontal? It is the interspersion of vertical scenery and horizontal scenery. Originally, a painting should have towering places and also horizontal places in order to show changes and levels. For example, trees are towering, and the slopes and rocks below should be spread horizontally; the main peak is towering, and the distant mountains should be arranged horizontally. Also, the main part of a painting is towering, and the supporting part should be arranged horizontally; the main part is horizontal, and the supporting part should be straight and towering. The scenery of ancient paintings is so easy to see as far away because this principle is applied.</p>
<p>What is meant by emptiness and fullness? Fullness is the part with brush and ink, and emptiness is the blank part. A painting must have emptiness and fullness, or more fullness and less emptiness, or more emptiness and less fullness. It should be considered at any time to ensure stability. Recent commentators on painting believe that it is better to have more emptiness and less fullness than more fullness and less emptiness, but this is not entirely true. Ancient paintings often have thousands of mountains and trees, filling the paper, but they do not necessarily look not ethereal; while recent paintings, although they have only a hill and a gully, with a full paper of blank space, sometimes feel solid; this is because the ancients arranged them properly, while recent people are not good at composition. For example, in the midst of towering mountains and ridges, revealing a section of clouds and smoke in the most suitable place feels infinitely ethereal, while a full paper of blank space turns out to have no ethereal interest. The ancients said, "The ancients' positions are tight but the brush and ink are loose, and the modern people's positions are relaxed but the brush and ink are solid," these two sentences are also very reasonable.</p>
<p>Landscape painting is mainly based on trees and rocks (rocks include mountains). A painting must have main trees and main mountains: in the whole picture, among several clusters of trees, there must be a cluster of main trees (often the closest cluster), and among several layers of mountains, there must be a layer of main mountains; in one layer, among several trees, there must be a main tree (often the frontmost one), and among several mountains, there must be a main mountain. The main trees and main mountains should be described with special effort. Once the main trees and main mountains are good, the whole picture will gain momentum. (The main trees and main mountains should be in a relatively central position, not too biased to one side.)</p>
<p>Having trees and mountains is the formal style of landscape painting; having trees without mountains, or having mountains without trees, is the variant style of landscape painting. Variant styles can only be done occasionally, and doing too much will lack interest. The composition of the variant style should be peculiar, so that people will not feel monotonous when they look at it. The most important thing is to change it a little.</p>
<p>Although the three principles of unity, evenness, and change must be applied everywhere in the painting, special attention should be paid to the layout aspect. The reason why a painting must have main trees and main mountains is to apply the principle of unity, using the main trees and main mountains to command and connect everything, so that the viewer's attention is concentrated. The layout of a painting should not be too biased to one side, and it must be symmetrical everywhere, which is applying the principle of evenness. The layout of a group of paintings should not be too symmetrical everywhere. It must be either biased to the left, or biased to the right, or biased to the top, or biased to the bottom, sparse where there should be density, dense where there should be sparseness, rising and falling, one real and one empty. This is applying the principle of change. And in the whole picture, all parts must echo each other, and the energy should not be interrupted, which is also the most important point. (This is also the principle of unity.)</p>
<p>Ordinary landscape paintings must leave "heaven and earth heads" up and down (heaven and earth heads are the blank spaces above and below). Generally, "heaven and earth heads" should be about one-fourth or one-fifth of the painting, not too much or too little; "earth head" should be about one-third of "heaven head," but it is not fixed, and should be considered at any time. Some paintings do not reveal the "heaven head" or do not reveal the "earth head," and some do not reveal the "heaven and earth heads." This is also a kind of variant style. Generally, high and distant paintings often do not reveal the "heaven head" to show their height; deep and distant paintings often do not reveal the "earth head" to show their depth (some reveal a section of clouds above, and some reveal a section of clouds below, which is even more profound); as for flat and distant paintings, they leave more "heaven and earth heads" to show the openness. Therefore, the layout of flat and distant paintings is the most common compositional method in landscape painting.</p>
<h3>Reading the Paintings of the Three Wangs at Mei Jing Shu Wu</h3>
<p>— Jin Qijing</p>
<p>On a long summer evening, I went to Songshan Road to visit the Mei Jing Shu Wu owner. There are studios of two contemporary first-class painters on Songshan Road, one is Songshan Caotang, and the other is Mei Jing Yi Lu.</p>
<p>The owner of Mei Jing Hua Wu is rich in collection. He has hundreds of famous paintings from past dynasties, and he is proficient in identification. Therefore, people who collect ancient paintings must read his inscriptions and identifications. He has the first masterpiece in the world, the "Fuchun Mountain Dwelling" by Huang Zijiu of the Yuan Dynasty. Although it is only a corner of the ruins, its great achievements have been passed down and it is worth being called a national treasure.</p>
<p>The owner has four three-foot-sized landscape paintings of the Four Wangs, all of which are the same size. Although the ages of these four landscape paintings are different, the paper is clean and flawless, and there is no difference at all. Among them, the two paintings by Shi Gu and Lu Tai are hung on the walls next to the owner's bed, which is truly "lying down and traveling" in the landscape! Shi Gu is in ink and wash, imitating Huang He Shan Qiao's brushwork, but it is smooth and easy, which is different from Shi Gu's other styles. Especially his brushwork is delicate and elegant, which is simply indistinguishable from Nantian's landscape! Some people say that Nantian and Shi Gu were friendly, and Nantian was unwilling to be in second place, so he changed to learning flowers and plants to avoid Shi Gu, but Nantian's landscape has a unique secluded and delicate style, and it is not necessarily "second place"! This Shi Gu landscape is painted very richly, but the richness of the mountains has emptiness in it. Most painters only want to draw a few strokes casually to boast of emptiness. If you have seen this Shi Gu landscape, you will inevitably have new discoveries.</p>
<p>Lu Tai is originally good at light ochre. This one uses Yunlin's brushwork and writes a light ochre landscape in Yifeng's brushwork. Lu Tai once criticized Shi Gu's landscape for being "too ripe" and self-declared it as "not raw and not ripe". In this light ochre landscape, it can prove that his words are not too exaggerated. The brushwork is strong and powerful, and it seems to be different from the Shi Gu landscape on the right. As for the brushing of color, it is even more skillful. The owner of Mei Jing Shu Wu and I pointed to it with a smile and said: Lu Tai's use of color is really indescribably subtle!</p>
<p>After seeing Shi Gu and Lu Tai, I unfolded Yan Ke's landscape. It is also in ink and wash, and it also uses Yunlin's artistic conception, and the brushwork is not purely Yunlin. At the top is an inscription by Zhao Xiangguang. The owner of the Shu Wu once said that this Yan Ke is a work of his prime at the age of forty-one. Zhao Xiangguang was already an old man of nearly eighty at that time, and the inscription is full of flattering and encouraging words. On this point, the opinion of the owner of the Shu Wu is completely the same as mine. He said: Yan Ke is clearly a painter of the Ming Dynasty, but the historians forcibly pulled him to be a painter of the Qing Dynasty in order to put together the name of the "Four Wangs"! It seems that the modern Xiao Wu Lao is also an old senior painter over eighty years old, who has enjoyed great fame for fifty or sixty years! Will the historians in the future consider him a painter of the Qing Dynasty? Or a painter of the Republic of China?</p>
<p>Finally, I wanted to see Lianzhou's painting, but the owner of the Shu Wu said: I don't know where it is hidden, and I can't find it for a while! It can be seen that there are really too many famous paintings in the collection of Mei Jing Hua Wu. I can only read the Three Wangs and cannot make up the Four Wangs.</p>

<h3>Miss Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The election of Miss Shanghai has encountered many setbacks. It was once said that Bai Yang, Zhou Xuan, Hu Feng, Qin Yi, and others from the film star group would participate. However, Bai Yang is currently filming in Beiping and does not plan to come to Shanghai. Zhou Xuan recently declined to participate, and Hu Feng has also formally denied it. It is still unknown whether Qin Yi will agree, which is truly worrying and disappointing for this grand event.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there are still exciting things. It is said that a student from the Minli Girls' Middle School, Gao Qingyi, voluntarily signed up with the North Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association fundraising meeting to participate in the election. Miss Gao said that her participation in the election is based on the spirit of human mutual assistance and the ancient teaching of disaster relief and neighborly compassion. Her motivation is entirely for disaster relief and she does not hope to be elected. This demeanor of a seventeen-year-old high school student is worthy of admiration. Moreover, the 3.5 million displaced compatriots in North Jiangsu will sincerely bless Miss Gao, who is leading the way with her benevolent and chivalrous spirit.</p>
<p>Regarding the election of Miss Shanghai, I hope that whether those in charge or other parties do not harbor a playful attitude. Everyone's attitude should be serious and earnest. To be honest, if the organizers treat it as a "gimmick" and do not handle it as a very serious matter, then the atmosphere among the onlookers will definitely be frivolous, and participants will naturally fear attracting gossip and be unwilling to show their faces. In today's bad social atmosphere, "looking at everything from the worst perspective" is the most popular. Lack of confidence, distrust of others, and unwillingness to be kind to others are truly the fatal wounds of our country. We must correct this phenomenon by being serious in everything, doing one thing like one thing, with a serious attitude, and with everything open and honest.</p>
<p>I don't know the reason why these few film stars in the Miss Shanghai election group are shrinking back, but I believe it must be related to the above situation. In fact, this year truly requires people with the courage to be fools. If we are determined to relieve the North Jiangsu refugees, what is there to worry about? Don't take your own identity too seriously. Society is not blind, and its evaluation of someone is very fair. Therefore, for the sake of this righteous cause, it is a pity that these few ladies in the film star group could not participate! Miss Gao Qingyi is even more worthy of our support.</p>
<h3>Talking About Freaks</h3>
<p>— Zhong Qi</p>
<p>Chinese people have always regarded giving birth to multiple children as an auspicious thing, a symbol of wealth. If a woman gives birth to triplets or quadruplets, then it is considered a great joyous event and spread as news. Conversely, if a freak is born, needless to say, it is considered an ominous omen. The family or clan members will definitely carry out various cruel acts of killing such as burying or drowning, and the mother has no right to protect the child, and can only grieve in secret.</p>
<p>In fact, according to scientific principles, the above concepts are completely wrong. Now I will give a relatively simple explanation of the relationship between multiple births and freaks.</p>
<p>According to the research results of scientist Grollo Liex, the chance of multiple births is: approximately one out of eighty-five mothers may produce twins; the ratio of triplets is seven thousand to one; quadruplets are about six hundred seventy-five thousand to one; of course, the chance of quintuplets is even less.</p>
<p>As for the reasons for multiple births, there are two main possibilities: the first is that there are two eggs in the ovary that develop simultaneously, each fertilized to produce two individuals. These twins may be of the same sex or of different sexes. The second is that a fertilized egg is stimulated and undergoes equal division, each developing into an individual. Because these twins are divided from one body, their sex, appearance, and temperament are often completely identical. Sometimes, even their parents cannot tell them apart. For example, the twin brothers who starred in the movie "The Beggar Emperor" in Hollywood a few years ago cannot be distinguished by the average audience.</p>
<p>Twins like the above may not have completely separated in the early stages of embryonic development, and later evolve into various freaks with one head and two bodies, or two heads and one body. Another situation is that the temperature, nutrients, air, etc. in the mother's body are abnormal, and the fertilized egg is locally obstructed, which may produce freaks missing certain limbs.</p>
<p>For example, embryologist Roux has done such experiments: he used a red-hot needle to kill one of the not-yet-completely-separated fertilized eggs. As a result, the grown individual was incomplete. Another example is that German biologist Spemann wrapped the embryos of salamanders with young children's hair, and local development was hindered. As a result, freaks such as two heads or two tails also occurred.</p>
<p>Therefore, freaks are not like those superstitious explanations. There is no need to treat them as terribly as poisonous snakes, and even less to ridicule and despise the pregnant woman, so as to avoid various tragedies!</p>
<h3>Misleading the Youth</h3>
<p>— Li Jinxiang</p>
<p>Undeniably, education is sacred, but sacredness cannot be eaten or worn. Those who teach and spend their youth covered in chalk dust, what are they doing it for? Cultivating talents for the country, for the sacredness of education? Or for a living? The answers vary from person to person.</p>
<p>In today's education field, teachers receive a meager salary every month that keeps them from starving to death, and it's the same monotonous routine, month after month. The semester ends, summer vacation begins... They themselves can't quite figure out the transition between winter and summer, the passage of days and months. They vaguely remember that many students who were trained by them in the past have now become celebrities, wealthy businessmen, and tycoons in society, but looking back at themselves, they remain the same, except that there are a few more holes in their coarse cloth shirts!</p>
<p>Education is sacred, but you can't starve to death for the sake of education!</p>
<p>Most of the older teachers have abandoned their books and left the education field to do non-sacred work. The vacant positions are naturally filled by a batch of newly graduated students who have no teaching experience at all. Students' questions often leave them speechless and unable to answer. Therefore, for the sake of face, they resign. As a result, teachers are replaced every three or five days. In a semester, the textbooks haven't been taught halfway through, and the teachers have been replaced more than half a dozen times. This trend is most prevalent in primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>The downturn in the education sector is one of the reasons for this. Amidst the current rectification of academic standards in various schools, it is hoped that each school will pay special attention to the teachers' academic level and teaching experience.</p>
<h3>Fee Issues at the Municipal Gymnasium</h3>
<p>— Song Lian</p>
<p>Yesterday, I accompanied a friend to the Municipal Gymnasium (old Jai Alai Court) on South Shaanxi Road to watch volleyball. I heard Mr. Yao (who specializes in managing the rental of the venue) from the gymnasium say, "Now, because the floor is newly laid and needs to be waxed every day, the cost is very high. In the future, renting the venue will cost 4,000 yuan per hour (daytime), and practicing at night will require an additional 4,000 yuan for electricity (i.e., 8,000 yuan per hour at night). Each team also has to pay a deposit of 20,000 yuan."</p>
<p>I found this very strange. "The Municipal Gymnasium is not a private one, and all expenses should be allocated by the government. In any case, you cannot turn the idea on the teams!"</p>
<p>What I found even stranger was that the fees charged were actually more expensive than the fees for private venues. The YMCA court in Eight Immortals Bridge only charges 1,000 yuan per hour!</p>
<p>I feel that the deposit of 20,000 yuan per team should be paid. When the lease expires, if there are no unexpected events, it should be refunded!</p>
<p>If the Municipal Gymnasium must charge fees, it must be cheaper than private venue fees!</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the executives of the Municipal Gymnasium will give further consideration to this yet-to-be-announced news.</p>
<h3>American Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Since the victory, American soldiers have often become a topic of discussion. Upon closer examination, opinions are divided. On the one hand, when they drive their lightning-fast jeeps and flaunt jeep girls through the streets, people look on with disapproval. However, their frankness and straightforwardness can also win people's sympathy. The following is what Americans think of American soldiers. The original article is published in the "Military Digest." I am now giving a free translation, so that we can also get a glimpse of their self-criticism.</p>
<p>Deeply Loves His Homeland and Ridicules All Foreign Things: Emotionally agitated, the American soldier is often confident that he himself and his hometown are superior to everything, and ridicules everything foreign.</p>
<p>Frank and Sincere, But Easily Deceived by Merchants: American soldiers are all extremely sincere, frank, and friendly. They believe that everyone is innocent unless proven otherwise. However, because of their integrity and pride, they are often deceived by merchants!</p>
<p>Tolerates Foreign Philosophy, But Easily Angered Behind a Donkey Cart: The United States is a young country, so its national character tends to be optimistic. When seeing the hesitation and indecision of foreigners, although they are confused, they are extremely tolerant. But on a narrow road, when a donkey cart is blocking the way in front, they will shout: "It's their own fault for being so poor, they are still slow, a donkey-drawn culture. We overcome difficulties and have never needed anyone's help"?</p>
<p>Respects Native Girls, But Treats Foreign Women as Prostitutes: The American soldier's friendship is genuine and deep; he respects his native girls sevenfold unless they are proven to be ignoble. However, abroad, he treats all foreign women as prostitutes.</p>
<p>Can Endure Hardships, But Becomes Childish When Homesick: American soldiers can endure any harm they encounter. He doesn't need sympathy. If he loses his right hand, he will use his left hand. But when they suffer from homesickness, they become very childish and clamor to go home.</p>
<p>Respects His Rights, But Accepts Orders from Superiors with Resentment: Although he has undergone four years of military training, his respect for his rights has not diminished. He is a self-respecting person and the greatest hope in the age of democracy. But he does not understand that those who issue orders often bear heavier responsibilities. He envies the lieutenant or captain above him, but at the same time, he hopes for easy promotion.</p>

<h3>Both Crying and Laughing</h3>
<p>— Zhi Fen</p>
<p>At a certain middle school on Shanzhong Road, the biology teacher not only does not care when students cheat during exams, but also opens the door for each student when they finish well. The students all laugh, and he says, "What's so strange about that? The teacher is the servant of the students, and the students are the teacher's providers."</p>
<p>There is also a history teacher who, during exams, allows students to flip through their books. Two students could not find the answer, so they said to the teacher, "Teacher, I'm afraid you've made a mistake in this question. Why can't we find it in the book?" The teacher said, "You students are really stupid. How can you not know how to flip through the book!" So the teacher flipped it out for them.</p>
<p>At a certain middle school on Jing'an Temple Road, because the landlord wanted to take back the school building and did not discuss it with the school board, he was about to move the furniture in. Dozens of students voluntarily stayed in the school, so that the classroom was the classroom during the day, but it became a dormitory at night.</p>
<p>At a certain famous university, the first-year Chinese teacher was from Ningbo. This teacher said to the students: "When you study in England, you have to speak English. When you study in France, you have to speak French. Now that you are studying painting with me, Mr. Ningbo, you must all speak Ningbo dialect."</p>
<h3>An Old Man's Heart (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Xiluo, a senior figure in the Jiangsu education circle, suddenly took pity and sent out a telegram of hunger strike, advising Zhu De and Mao Zedong of Yan'an not to forget that they are both descendants of the Yellow Emperor and to save the three million refugees in northern Jiangsu. Although it may not have any effect, it is at least a call of the times. Although the idea of "humanitarianism" has been recognized as outdated by those who advocate "animalism," one cannot deny that one is a human being who can speak beautiful words, fall in love, stand upright on two feet, use hands to obtain things, or express brilliant opinions, and has significant differences from animals. When a huge number of more than three million people are recorded as refugees who are about to die, Mr. Yuan's occasional call for sympathy is, in any respect, not immoral. A few days ago, the great British writer George Bernard Shaw, who celebrated his ninetieth birthday, once said some honest words: "Now, communism has become the most fashionable cosmetic. Young people can't find a lover if they don't believe in communism. Middle-aged people who have achieved nothing can become famous all over the world by believing in communism. Older people should believe in communism even more, otherwise they will always be backward and never move forward." Now, this Mr. Yuan is unwilling to move forward but is willing to fall behind. He even has the courage to risk 'the world's great disapproval?' and sympathize with the three million refugees in northern Jiangsu who are displaced. It is pitiful that countless helpless children are about to starve to death or die tragically. His ambition is commendable, but his foolishness is inexcusable!</p>
<p>Chinese people are the smartest, most realistic, and most concerned about face. If they see that they have nothing to lose and will become unusable "rotten wood," they will immediately have a flash of inspiration and, like betting on a treasure, pick a path of "both fame and fortune" and go all out in order to easily satisfy their desires. Here, I also recall the words of the old Mr. Ye Chucang. He said: "The signboard of the Revolutionary Party was most lucky and popular in the year of Xinhai. When the Founding Father took office as the interim president in Nanjing, the north and south of the Yangtze River and all parts of the country were full of Revolutionary Party members. If you ask the villagers drinking old tea in the teahouse if they are Revolutionary Party members, they will definitely answer without thinking: 'Yes!' Ask those squatting on the latrine, ask those who analyze characters, tell fortunes, divination, and perform civilized dramas, as well as those who scrub backs, trim feet in bathhouses, and those who shave heads and clean ears in barbershops, and they can all answer fluently: 'Yes! Yes!' As for those gentlemen who call themselves scholar-officials, needless to say. By the second year, when Yuan Shikai wanted to become emperor and massively arrested and killed Revolutionary Party members, when the news of the suffering of Song Jiaoren and Chen Yingshi was written in large letters in the Minquan Bao and Minli Bao, an emergency rumor spread throughout the country. Strangely, those members of the scholar-official class—the so-called intellectuals of society—were so frightened that they burned the Revolutionary Party pamphlets and the Minquan Bao and Minli Bao overnight, burning them until not a single word was left. Even if they were not necessarily Yuan Shikai's loyal subjects, at least no one admitted to being a Revolutionary Party member. And those who performed civilized dramas were still propagating revolution in Shanghai, and those who scrubbed backs and trimmed feet were still talking to the bathers in the bathhouse about how the Revolutionary Party broke through Nanjing City from Yuhuatai and Shencemen, taking pride in thinking that they were also Revolutionary Party members!" The old Mr. Ye was also telling the truth.</p>
<p>Three or Two Words Collection</p>
<h3>Traitor Chu Can't Escape the Death Penalty</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>In order to promote thrift and eliminate superstition, the municipal government has ordered the police department to ban the Hungry Ghost Festival. The first to be hit, of course, are the monks and Taoists. A large income in the budget will be lost. But assuming that social celebrities launch a large-scale Taoist ceremony to "deliver the deceased generals and martyrs and ask about the compatriots in distress", can it be exempt from the ban?</p>
<p>The Supreme Court rejected Chu Minyi's appeal for retrial, which means that Chu Minyi should still be executed and cannot be reversed. In these many days, Chu Minyi thought he had hope and had been having a "sweet dream." But a bolt from the blue confirmed that he would eventually not escape death. So his short-term "sweet dream" was just like the "sweet dream" he had after collaborating with the enemy until the victory, and it was shattered again.</p>
<p>The loss of the old Public Works Bureau archives caused by the report on the He De案 case made me think of the legend of the "Yu Tang Chun" story; according to friends who love Peking opera, "the files of this case are still well hidden in a certain county in Shanxi Province" and have not been "lost". The indeed, it seems like a person only finds himself in a considerably difficult environment". Indeed, it can be confirmed from a portion of friends returning from the rear that their words are not false.</p>
<p>Non-Shanghainese who have lived in Shanghai for two or three generations then call themselves Shanghainese. In fact, according to the law, it seems that a person from place A can be considered a person from place B as long as they have lived in place B for three years. But many "Shanghainese" look down on newcomers from other places. They often scold them as "country bumpkins," which is simply scolding themselves and their ancestors.</p>
