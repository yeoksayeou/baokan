<p>社評</p>
<h3>從速建立民意機關</h3>
<p>政府為尊重民意，應即建立民意機關，無論在中央方面或地方方面，都有從速實現的需要。這是本報一貫主張。過去對於理論上實施上，，已經屢次中述及建議。於此，我們時加複引如次：</p>
<p>去年一月九日國民政府對英美宜戰，本報社評以「論參戰」為題，認為人民所最關切的問題是參戰以後怎樣？我們貢獻當局兩點：第一就是尊重民意。參戰既已確定為國策，則有關國家民族前途和人民大衆生活的，都必須博採人民的公意，都必須取得人民充分的了解。人民是最重耍最是最後的决定力量。國策的貫澈，政令的實施，如果得不到人民自動的積極的參加和擁護，决不會順利推行，決不會順利完成。如果不願意國策自國策，人民自人民，兩者不協同，則今後一切就必須廣徵民意，博採懷精，尤其是要充分發揚人民的力量。也只有這樣尊重民意，才能實現國策，才能爭取勝利。</p>
<p>去年九月九日，為參戰後八個月，本報社評以「參戰八個月的反省」為題，對於過去作客觀分板四點，其中第三點指出，戰時政治迄未見有效率的表現，政治體制雖有調整，惟實質效率，終未獲得，其主因當在與人民利益尙有隔閡，故人民一日無參政機會，即民意一日不能有效表達，政府措施與人民公意之間，尚有鴻溝存在。</p>
<p>去年七月六日，將次接收租界之前，本報社評以「新生上海之建設與民意機關」為題，認為建設新生上海，特別重要而且必須早作準備，俾能迅速實現的，就是樹立新生上海的眞正民意機關。以便協助政府，這個民意機關，一定具備幾個基本條件，第一，在職權方面必須明確規定，對於一切巿政設施，具有協助政府調査設計，向政府提供意見，以及對於特殊有關民生事業與設施之監督的權力。我們認為只有建立賦與此種權力的民意機關，才能為政府的耳目，為民衆的喉舌，使政府的施策為民衆所擁護，使民衆的疾苦與要求為政府所了解，因此才能切實集中官民一切力量，共同担負新生上海的建設事業，否則，政府與民衆脫節，任何建設就無從談起。第二，在組織方面，必須嚴密而靈活，不一定要有龐大的形式與機構，但是必須要便於執行其工作及發揮其效能。同時，為了實現這種要求，這個民意機關的本身組織也必須力避官僚主義與衙門化，在人選方面，尤須慎重，一定要從眞正的市民中推選出可以代表民衆，而且為民衆所信任敬愛的領袖與專門人才。</p>
<p>上面引述的話，都是我們過去對於建立民意機關的主張。我們再觀察大東亞各國，都有同性質的民意機關，如盟邦日本，有議會，大政翼贊會等。新興的菲律賓，緬甸，有國會等。馬來，爪哇等地原住民也有參議院等。即重慶方面雖由國民黨包辦，但也有「參政會」的設立。我們認為凡是賢明的政府當局，一定是重視民意，有議會，大政翼贊會等。新興的菲律賓，緬甸，有國會等。馬來，爪哇等地原住，是最好的推動政令的方法。况且，在此戰爭時期，尤其需要人民澈底協力，才能確保勝利。</p>
<p>其次，就上海市而言，其地位之重要巳不待言，過去市政府有參議會，租界有董事會公董局納稅會等，也是民意表達的機構。自從去年八月租界接收以後，陳市長也會表示，民意機關的建立自有必要，半年以後決可成立，不必再加考慮。可是時光易逝，迄今尙未見有民意機關之建立，為了上海市的前途，為克盡戰時重要後方基地的任務，民意機關遲遲成立，不能不引為遺憾。我們理想中的民意機關，已經數數建言，於此，略為複叙及補充意見如次：</p>
<p>代表人選，自以孚人望者為唯一條件。目前限於環境未能由人民公選，則由市府指定延聘，惟須打破黨籍，同鄉，地域等觀念。</p>
<p>上海是經濟的中心，應以民間經濟界人士為中心。其餘除國民黨以外，如靑年黨國社黨等優秀分子，也當羅致。</p>
<p>民意機關之內，應設立各種專門委員會，討論建議各種專門問題，如財務，經濟，公用，治安，文化，敎育，社會福利，衛生等等委員會，延聘各部門專家及富有經騐人士担任。</p>
<p>以往二三年間，市府當局與民間人士，極少聯繫，這是很大的缺憾。如果建立了民意機關，則當局與民間人士有了經常接觸機會，自會發生密切聯繫，從而消除官民間的隔閡。此外，盟邦日本留滬僑民為數頗多，為進一步取得密切協調建設大上海，盟邦僑民的意見，也有盡量溝通之必要。應與盟邦僑民領袖經常接觸，組織並舉行懇談性質的定期集會，一面聽取意見，一面闡釋政令，使雙方絕無隔閡。</p>
<p>最後，我們主張欲求政洽修明，以革新為首要。就上海而言，第一是政治革新，第二是經濟革新，第三是建立民意機關，然後才可確保治安，逐漸達成理想中的大上海市。同時，也惟有如此步驟，才能發揮經濟力量，克盡後方重要基地的使命，而貢獻於大東亞戰爭的勝利！</p>
<h3>日軍遮斷敵連擊遙向吉大港猛進　頓札恩附近英軍萬人被圍</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　緬甸前綫某基地電：日軍某部隊於琴丘陵頓札恩附近之擊滅戰時，達成側面掩護之使命後，今主力已自哈加方面開始行動，刻正遙向吉大港猛進中。同時追擊敗敵，自加拉頓河谷北上之日軍某部隊與之相呼應，冒敵熾烈之退却掩護砲火，並在自該河右岸側面遮斷攻勞之另一部隊緊密遝繫下，繼續急進，已行過肯姜，刻正向某耍衝進擊中。又於此河右岸之該方面日軍亦開始行動，自民當，印貝猶北方進擊，故今於加拉頓河谷蠢動，欲挽回阿拉坎頹勢之敵西非軍八十一師團，及向阿拉坎出擊之敵三師團，巳遭逢被殲滅之命運。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　緬甸前綫日軍某基地訊：頓扎恩附近之英印軍第十七師團主力釣一萬人，頃已為日軍包圍，日軍空陸一體展開猛攻，即日軍各部隊於頓扎恩東方擊潰敵軍之頑強抵抗，並予殲滅打擊。十四日晨九時，日軍更在該地北方以肉搏戰而佔領該地，將梯迭姆，頓扎恩方面敵軍退路完全切斷，而展開苛烈之殲滅戰，使頓扎恩之敵軍軍事設施發生大火災。又其他一部隊，則於十四日晨在頓扎恩西北方三公里附近之辛肯地區，對擁有戰車自動砲等之敵有力部隊加以猛攻，更於要路某某附近襲擊北上之敵軍，使其陷於大混亂，鹵獲其載重汽車百數十輛，敵軍於日軍包圍圈中，雖左衝右突，但其被殲滅僅時間間題。</p>
<p>里期本十六日中央社電　據新德里來電，東南亞組亞軍司令部十五日發表戰况公報稱：日軍與反軸心間，已於布其頓北方地區展開熾烈白刃戰。</p>
<h3>安達曼等兩島防禦極堅固</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　據印度洋上最前綫安達曼·尼科巴爾列島，隨緬印國境戰局之進展，其重耍性頓形增大，東南亞洲反軸心軍司令官蒙特巴頓仍掩飾陸戰之失敗，企圖挽回頹勢，似擬以海上迂迴作戰，在該兩列島取得根據地，並大事宣傳緬甸反攻作戰，若將大規模以海軍轉用於孟加拉灣方面，則可突破阿拉坎山脈。按該兩列島乃粉碎敵方防衛大東亞資源地帶之戰略綫，亦為掌握孟加拉灣制海，制空權之一大要塞，故有孟加拉灣要塞綫之稱。昭和十七年三月，日軍進駐該兩列島，迄今二年，防衛工事已極堅固，主要島嶺計安達曼島有南北中小四安達曼島，尼科巴島，則為加尼科巴，南科里及大尼科三島，以上均為不足一千平方公里之小島，首府布熏爾港開發最善，除加尼科巴島外，其他各鳥多為森林地帶，不能即刻成為陸上航空基地，因受此種地理環境限制，故具有特殊要塞綫之性格。縱敵軍於其中一烏登陸成功，亦難構築飛行基地，徒成為日海空軍之餌食，現於孟加拉灣對而，日·英兩空軍之轟炸戰及偵察戰方酣，一俟印度洋上戰機成熟，此海上之近代要塞綫，可證為决對難攻不落，若蒙特巴頓企圖自海上實行反攻，料必被日軍粉碎，反使日軍攻略印度有利。</p>
<h3>襲雷州島敵機被擊落四架</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　據華南某日軍基地訊：日海軍航空部隊，富本月十三日有P40　B25型敵機編隊來襲海口機塲時，曾與敵機八架交綏。又於雷州半島上空與另批B25型敵機五架遭遇，發生激戰，結果擊落B25型敵機一架，P40型三架，並擊毀B25型P40型敵機數架，日方損失極微。</p>
<p>霍魏島西岸登陸敵殲滅　波島日軍進攻敵陣地</p>
<p>拉巴爾十五日中央社電　十一日晟曾有敵魚雷艇及登陸用舟艇各一艘，在霍魏島（阿得米拉的羣島馬化斯島東端羅連高北方約一公里）西岸實行登陸，該方面日海軍部隊即與之交戰，已將登陸敵軍殲滅。</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　據中太平洋日軍某其地電，敵B25型機三架，十四日晨曾來襲馬紹爾羣島雅爾特島。又敵B25型機三架同日下午曾來襲米勒島，但均被日軍守備隊擊退，日方無損害。</p>

<h3>后大椿胡政犯贓案判决書原文</h3>
<p>（續昨）又同年二月二十日，后大椿眞榮第（二六二九）部隊隊長，成立購買米糧一萬噸合同，在吳縣吳江無錫三縣征辦，共用收買資金總額三千二百三十九萬六千一百二十七元，榮部隊僅交給金額二千七百三十八萬一千八十四元，損失五百零一萬五千四十三元；又利息七五七一六七元，兩共損失，五七七二二一零元，榮部隊曾允以購米價款　額六分之一，配給洋火肥皂洋臘香烟糖棉布等物資，詎后大椿接受該項物資後，僅以十分之三之物資配給於六米之農民，其餘十分之七，即從事販買圖十分之七，即從事販買岡利，共獲純利七七八九五零一元，除補償前項損失外，實得不法利益二七七四四五八元五角三分八厘。又同年五月上旬，后大椿受崑山麺粉廠業公會主任朱子誠之慫恿，在糧食部米糧收買資金四千五百萬元內，提出三五零萬元收買麵粉一二九零十袋，于同年八月中，由其自已所設之萬豐雜糧行經理唐鍊侯搬出南翅地區，買與商人張芻生，獲得純利約一百四十萬元，以致前項麵粉非法流入上海地區。又同年三月間，后大椿經耿嘉　介紹，得鐵米商沈霖卿，同年四月即于糧食部寄來收買米糧之資金中先後付與六零零萬元（江蘇地方銀行支票）吃其在蘇州徵辦米糧一五零零零石，同月中旬採銷辦事處長胡政就任，后大椿又代為介紹該沈霖卿，以廉價收買多量米糧，待至市價高漲，再行繳入糧食局及採銷辦事處。計在靑浦收買約一七八〇石在嘉善收買三〇〇〇石轉賣，嗣由沈霖卿於同年六月讓送后大椿胡政各五十四萬元並另赠后大椿汽車一輛，同月之末，復由胡政轉交后大椿八七五〇〇〇元，除其中之五〇萬元，轉交他人外，餘款由后大椿自得。（未完）</p>
<h3>閑話時局</h3>
<p>— 德富蘇峰</p>
<p>人為萬物之靈，支配和運用萬物，這是不待言的，就是人對於我們日本軍國大計來說，往往也必須認為是物。關於數量問題，自從孫子以來，業已成為兵家最重要者。所以人口的坩加，就是治國平天下的最高任務。換言之，像我們日本這樣國家，雖然在戰時，或者說，正因為在戰時，人口增加率的反而增加，竟每年有二百萬人口的增加，這實在不能不使我們謝天謝地。</p>
<p>然而，無論人力資源怎樣重要，都不能使懷抱嬰兒抬大砲，我們在此所要提倡者是年齡獻公的一點。但年齡獻公，决不是無限度的，。至少三十歲以上的男女，都各自獻納十歲，其所獻納的年齡，就是奉獻國家。獻納十歲，則三十歲者成為廿歲，四十歲者成為三十歲，以下如法遞減，而五成為四十，六十成為五十，七十成為六十，像我這樣八十二歲老人，自然也就成為七十二歲老人了。九十歲以上則為例外。如這樣年齡滅少，而過去的停年制度也全準此而加以改正，則前此的退伍者，也就得再回到隊伍裏去，就是正將退隱者，於是也可以延長服役年限、這樣的結果，全都是為了國家，自然人力資源就多起來了。</p>
<p>過去停兵制度之所以設立，是對於後進開關進路的意恩。然而像今天這樣工作山積，甚至猫狗都要被驅使服務塲合，現在自然已經談不到為後　開闢道路了。對於後進，應該有很多前進的機會。年靑人必須勞動，所以老人就不要勞動了，說　樣話者，正好像限制生育一樣可以說是消極論的極端。本來筋骨尙未衰弱，能力依然健在，且經騐與然練與年俱增者，而毫不吝惜地加以放棄，使之退隱，反而支付多餘的恩俸，使乏遊手好閑，這實在是人力經濟上極不合理的現象。甚至在承平時代，不得已而出此，這已經像最不合理的節制生育論風靡一時一樣的謬誤了，那末在今天這樣緊急關頭，而有如此謬論，慼當儘速一廓而淸。</p>
<p>或許有人說，這對於老人誠然非常合適，然而對於壯丁，却不妥當。如果說筆者本身是老人，而為了站在擁護老人的立塲上，說幾句老人保護論，那末這就是天大的冤枉，我們處在今天道樣緊急關頭，絕對不需要有階級，男女，老少等區別。因為是老人，就不能作這件事，或者因為是壯了，就必須作這件事，婦女不許作戶外的事等，這終究是承平時代的話。今日不要再重視年齡，這看看所謂少年空軍，就可以瞭然於胸的。試觀中學尙未畢業的幼年學子，源源不斷地化為少年空軍，而在最前錢上殺敵致果，就可以知道必要時，年齡等是不成問題的。反過來可以說，越年靑越有用。年靑者旣如此，年老者當然也這樣。年靑者既有用，年老者當然也有用。</p>
<p>戰爭决不簡單。進行一個戰爭，如估計一下前綫和後方的工作，則大車小車，大輪小輪等一切繁雜工作，藝術地，綜合地配合起來，才能進行。所以處於今天這樣時代，年齡等絕不應當成為是否服務的標準。必須看是否適合於工作，這就是標準。然而某種工作，特別需要英氣蓬勃的人，而有的工作却不一定非限於某種年齡者不可。對於工作本身，應當物色能担任者就够了。所以我們始終主張採用新人，然而這决不是說，應當放棄舊人。現在蘇聯和英國，業巳擴張黴用年齡至六十歲，這樣看來，我們何妨實行年齡獻分論呢？凡担心老人搶奪年靑者的工作，或婦女搶奪男人的工作，於是主張担當現役任務者，縮減至最低限度者，即不僅是極端狹義地瞭解了國家總力戰的意義，而且是阻撓和破壞總力戰的最高目的。在非當時期，就必須按非常時期的方式工作。（魯譯自二月九日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>日為協力建設新中國不惜任何支援　谷大使蒞滬談話</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日駐華大使谷正之氏，前曾赴華南華北蒙疆漢口等地，作日本對華新政策實施以來之自次巡視，茲已事畢，於昨（十六）日下午二時半，乘車抵滬，豫定勾留二三日後，即返京歸任。茲誌昨日會見記者團時所發表談話如次：</p>
<p>國府已正式開始實施戰時物價對策，此觀於此次之處罰貪官事件，即可明瞭，此舉可證明國府之政治力，已上軌道，而民衆對於國府之信賴，亦因之加強，實不勝慶賀之至。日本之對華新政策，赖全體中日官民之深切瞭解，正逐一實現，但其普及程度，因地域關係，有所差別，誠非得巳，或因民族及社會情形，而有差異，成某一部份地域，另具有其特色，故各地域之普及程度，並不一致，然今後深信日本對華新政策之眞意，必可日益發協，在不遠之將來，必可為民衆所徹底理解。因之如全面和平問題，全為國府之內政問題，日本僅取旁觀態度，吾人决以誠意為實現新政策而努力，渝方統治下之民衆，得能瞭解此項誠意，尙須相當時日，至少在大東亞戰爭期內，恐難有希望，然　人在其未瞭解以前，决示以誠意，以資開導，深信其瞭解之日，始眞正為全中國民衆自覺為大東亞民族之一日。渝方目下惟英美馬首是瞻，將來必能覺悟，惟有英美始為東亞之仇敵，為復興中國起見，日本所予中國之一切經濟上支援，尙須更積極的推進，無論在物價對策方面，成華中經工業振興對策方面，在其具體實現之前，豫料尙有相當困難，在此種情形之下，日本絕不袖手旁觀，為協力建設新中國起見，决不惜加以任何支援。</p>

<h3>南太平洋第一綫　密林從軍記</h3>
<p>被密林圍繞的友軍第一機塲內，寫着這　通訊。敵軍的第一綫，在越過眼前的森林約一百米突的地方。我們所處的壕內，因為每日下了大雨，雨水流入壕中，我們的下半身即浸在泥水裏。像這樣的壕，在這特洛基那　畔，千古朱經斧　的森林，到處都可以看到。在這練內，有鬥爭精神，如鐵一般</p>
<p>密林從軍記的堅定，為世界最精强的日軍將兵。敵軍犧牲航空母艦二十數艘，於去年十一月一日佔得特洛基那蟬的一角，自此巳閱四個多月，在這長久的期間，日軍第一綫的將兵·不　敵空軍的猛烈攻擊，仍死守着這第一綫，他們等待着在這森林中開闢一條着路，由後方運到大批大砲及子彈，就可以殲滅敵軍了。</p>
<p>敵軍自登陸以來，已　一自多日，遭受盲炸的森林，至現在仍在燃燒，常我寫着這　通訊的時候，也可聽到敵機的轟炸，把大樹木砍裂，而搖動着地軸。每有轟炸，壕內的泥水打得旋渦，泥土和水打上到兵士的肩上來。假使有飛機的話，有火砲，有子彈，那麼决不使敵軍獨自跳梁。在薩隆發響的敵機矗炸下，有一個　在泥水中的兵士，呌一句一來了」，瞬間左手拿着閃耀的銃劍，由壕內向外面跳出去了。</p>
<p>閃電光下黑夜行軍</p>
<p>特洛基那岬的血戰，是飛機與小槍，統劍的戰門。為什麼要這種的戰鬥呢？因為這個島噢，拒絕了陸上幾千年的交通，任其千古的密林　生的原故。我們很知道密林中的機動，是怎麼的困難，因為我們曾經潛行過波恩至特洛基那凡一百二十多公里，這中間全是黑暗的森林，白晝和夜裏一般的，經過十天以上的工夫，才到達目的地，我們的手和脚，發荆棘刺得流血。還耍嘗試密林戰的艱苦。我們在十多日以節，由靠近波恩的邁加啓程。因為白天有數機的炸學，不能行動。所以行動只在夜間。在夜間的森林中，我們兩個人手携着手行走，但也辦不出對方的臉孔呢。不過到了晚上，幸而每天一定下了兩三個鐘頭的大雨，所以我們可以趁着閃電　耀的瞬間行動，這是唯一的一路輩」呵。有時候在閃電中發見了友軍的電話綫，便憑着　綫行走。動身的時侯帶來的乾麺包，已被雨打濕，把它打成電子一樣吃下去。我們一想到從軍瓜達喀納島時候。會吃了螞蟻的窠和樹根，這次有麵包可以吃，覺得很幸福了。</p>
<p>陣地周圍種菜自給</p>
<p>過了四五天，我們居然覺得接近第一錢來了。然而愈接近第一棧，我們進行的速度愈快。待到森林着火，敵軍的砲炸愈形猛烈的時侯，火焰和炸雷的光錢。可以做了我們的目標，不必依賴閃　了。不過不知道其麼時候，會碰到敵軍，而且敵機與森林飛得一樣的高。它看到一個人也要實行槍舉。我們剝下芭蕉葉儒裝而進。接近前織的地方有着友軍的陣地，其陣地的周圍，有着僞裝的菜圃，種下白菜，蘿萄等等。我們由瓜島血戰的經騐，需要在懷烈的血戰塲實行自給自足。在戰鬥的餘暇相菜，眞是値得飲佩的。</p>
<p>過了七大，這森林變成濕地，雖然有小河，但是橋樑均被破壞。濕地淺即沒滕，深即沒腰。我們進軍的速度又樣密林地帶一樣弛緩了。更其覺得困難的是拍照，我們想把將兵的艱苦情形拍照傳到後方。但這地方濕度濃厚。要拍一張照片，耗去四五張的膠片。森林的上國有着張烈的太陽，我們是怎樣在渴望着太陽呀。我們要太陽，這是唯一的希望。但是我們若一看到太陽，那瞬間便不能生存，因為敵機不使我們行動。</p>
<p>利用小槍衝擊戰車</p>
<p>我們拿　筆桿和照相機自波恩到特洛基那的第一綫，尙口覺得這麼困難，至於軍隊的　動，已可推想而知。我們來到特洛基那第一綫，聽到隊長說着這參話：「當敵軍在特浴基那岬登陸的時侯，調動山砲部隊赴援·山砲　在步兵之後出發，觀過一兩天之後，山砲趕不上了。步兵　負小槍，兩手舉着蔓草前進，山砲的兵士即把山砲分當砲身，砲架·砲車三部份，追隨步兵而進。因為在這密林中不能與步兵同一行動，首先拋棄砲車，其次拋棄砲架，最後只留砲身，然而只有砲身却不能打砲，結果這批部隊，只以小槍應付運到陸上的敵軍戰車。任憑日本軍怎樣的強，小槍總敵不過戰車。所以若要勝利，在第一綫開勢路綫，然後，非由後方繼續還到國民以血汗結成的兵器，子彈不可。這時候不久就可來臨了。第一綫的將兵無論如何的樣牲，决意　　地鬥爭，所以不足　慮，請後方更須鞏固决意，這就是在南方波　　兩第一緩挺戰的兵士的呼聲了·一（弘曆自二月十二日　賣報知）</p>
<h3>義南前綫巡禮</h3>
<p>南部義大利戰綫，自反軸心軍在那茲諸登陸以來，更見緊張，亞平　山岳一帶隨處展開血戰。　賣新聞山時特派員，曾憤在賽凜冽的亞平　山岳一帶，從軍十日，以下為其觀察紀錄：</p>
<p>義南戰綫特徵</p>
<p>這一帶海岸起伏，山　錯綜，地形複雜，不，像東部戰綫一般可以展開大規模的戰載，勢非陣地戰不可，實具有沿岸防備戰和山岳戰並行的特性。因此降落傘部隊和砲兵隊的協力，山岳部隊和工兵部隊的協力，靈種配合成為必要，不特此也，更需要特織部隊的活躍。以　　降落傘師團之母聞名的許爾茲聯隊，及在高加爾　綫活躍的阿爾卑斯部記者從環戰綫最高　馬埃拉頂上眺望，只見自北而價山同時又有許多的峰和谷，由中世紀的領主的居城發展而成的義大利南部各都市，都矗立在這山頂上，一城和另一城之間。只有穿過溪谷的一條道路可通，故每一城市各自成為天然的要塞。</p>
<p>德軍在數量的方面，　不能與英美相比，但在質的方面，却有顯著的差別。利用加菜派藥山險，樣　　應地勢的各種陣地，用岩石草木覆掩，住房也有機的結合，構成火綫。一月十九日東部地區的德軍前綫基地綿延二公里的地方，敵軍發砲六百發之多，却不能前進一步，德軍陣地的巧妙可見。沿岸的防備亦然，記者曾訪問降落傘部隊許爾茲聯隊長，詢問一切，承答如下：</p>
<p>「此際德軍的沿岸防備，含有持久的守備性質的是機雷，水中障礙物，種堡之類；含有移動的攻擊性質的是飛機，潛水艇和各種砲火，並極度利用綫和大西洋沿岸的作戰，有幾分不同，因兵力和機動力的關係，在前者，必須將敵深深誘入內地，予以殲滅；在後者即在靠近永邊，予以反攻。而我軍十氣的軒昻，出乎預期以上，穗軍尙未有臨危之感。」</p>
<p>成為戰塲上的城市，破襲得亳無踪影，倍斯加拉為亞德里亞海沿岸美的城市之一，也不能例外，轟炸使四萬五千人口的　市淪為廢墟。記者入械　察，南方的太陽光明的輝　着，然而市街寂無人影利愛國詩人鄧南遮的奘生所，他　生的家裏，收　着他的圖書和作品，成為國寶。他的侄子和女傭住在那裏，這一家也不能免於轟炸之殃。在他屋子的一隔散　的紙屑中，記者發現了一對他母親署名的信，這是一八九九年七月二十六年日從佛羅倫斯發的，信上寫着：「我道幾天在瑪爾諾河口。母字」幾個字，使記者發生無限的感慨，但處處傳來響亮的大砲的響，忽又把記者引到現實的境界。</p>
<p>在某一戰區與德軍協力的新生義大利國防軍「　索里尼軍團」，表現着活躍的姿態，舊義大利國防軍潰滅後，在　索里尼新的理念和組織下，產生了新的國防軍，趕速前往第一綫執戈捍術。反軸心方面雖有巴特里奧叛軍參，事實上不過聊資點壕加，同胞分裂，手足相殘，演成了世紀的悲劇。（譯自二月三日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>南洋的心臟——特魯克羣島</h3>
<p>上月十七日晨，敵以有力機動部隊，反復前來空襲特魯克羣島，該方面日本陸海革部隊，會加以　擊。</p>
<p>自上月底敵美國在日本領士馬紹爾羣島展開侵攻戰以來，不出一旬，終以有力機動部隊出　內南洋中樞特魯克島，自十七日晨迄十八日晨，以艦載機數百架，編成大隊，開始眞正的大攻勢。特魯克羣島為日軍南方作戰綫的最　要堪點，敵的正面進攻，預料極為有力，戰綫巳更進一步迫近本士了。日軍陸海軍守備部隊士氣愈益激昻，邀擊　　，負起死守防衛祖國第一綫的重責，戰局即將突人晨重大的時機。</p>
<p>美國太平洋艦隊司令部十七日夜發表公報稱：特魯克島攻擊開始於十六日上午，參加者有美空軍機數百架。又美聯社電報稱：</p>
<p>據太平洋艦隊司令部報告，作戰或尙在繼續中，際此海軍最大攻擊作戰時，因實施無綫電統制，故不能從艦隊獲得詳報。（譯自二月十九日西部每日新　）</p>
<p>按「特魯克」一字，土語意即「聾人高空的山」，望文生義，可知該羣島的各島是　形的。周圍百五十哩的環礁中，散佈着四季島，木櫂島等許多島嶼，其中以羣島，永曜島最大，周圍達三十公里。島上多丘陵，雜木業生，出產乾木魚，高　貝等。住民是米克洛奈西亞系的加那加族，敵約一萬人的漁民，在陸上種植芋類和椰十。踏上特魯克一步，就覺得此處並無南洋的風味，一切情形和日本的漁村沒有兩樣，島民穿着日本製的夏衫和夏褲，從早上的「早安」到晚上的「　安」和日本人。同樣的語言，絕無　之感。夏島，水眼島上，有四年制的公立學校，島民的子弟在其中受敎育，與日本人絕無差異。要之，特魯克羣島，局內南洋的心臟，也是全整方南方的心臟，英勇的日軍為守護南海的生命綫努力擊退敵人。（節譯二月二十日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>海的夢</h3>
<p>— 英才</p>
<p>我幫着一顆彷徨無依的心靈，孤獨又寂寞的流蕩在上海，足足的四個年頭了，生命的苦杯中，連餘瀝也是痛苦的，　着生命的苦杯，度着殘餘的歲月，使我不敢有一分一秒的空想，使我不敢有半時半刻的淸醒，空想，淸醒，他們會無情的刺痛你千創百孔的心！我自己知道，所以我只讓我自己在醉鄉中度日月，無日無夜不斷的喝酒，醉吧！醉到我的末日，微風習習的深夜，我帶着顚倒的脚步跨出了小酒店，在歸途！那新月鈎在柳梢上，小星神秘的靈眼，那不是在提配我以往的歲月，很淸楚的使我憶起熟悉的，可紀念的畫面，畫面在黑夜裏像　食似的展開了，噬着甜蜜的回憶，讓心靈上有片刻的慰藉，她那一頭長長的，波浪似的好頭髮披在肩上，兩顆如海般深的瞳子嵌在眼眶裏，還有哪！泛着粉紅色的面頰，當她低頭含笑面帶羞向人的時候，好迷人的姿態，這一切都進一步的包圍我了，啊！更飄起了昔日我敎她的歌！海的夢，這是夢幻吧！</p>
<p>我靜下來再細細的聽，的確那　緩的歌聲，仍　在耳際，柳蔭下，佇立着一個滿手　着花的姑娘，我如同竟着了進失多年的　物，忘情的用熟悉的呼聲去招呼她，更帶着飄　然的身體走近她，可是她不睬我，翻難眼睛翹翹嘴的罵我醉漢！啊，好個莫測的女人心呀！她竟頭也不回的奔向街尾，無影無蹤的消失了，微風仍習習的吹着，吹散了醉意，我後悔不會追那消火了的姑娘，在街頭呆立了一會兒，舉起無力的脚步，萎靡的走進亭子間，凝望着床前的鏡框！</p>
<p>……十六年前的秋天，我和她相議在某個鄕村的溪邊，她佇立在溪邊擬奔，電光閃閃，雷聲陸隆，那兒來得及逃躲，四週盡是樹、轉了一個灣，我的住處到了，回頭看了看她，長髮浴着雨水，滿身沒有一小方的乾處，就憐惜的邀了她、在我處暫避她也毫無顧忌的坐着談着，雨愈下愈烈，我們的談話也愈談愈多，她爸爸是個隱居的詩人，她的名字呌淡烟，啊！在詩般的境地裹認識了詩般的姑娘，以後。淸晨，野草帶露時，一直到傍晚，夕陽沉沒時，她常常在溪邊，她自然的姿態，望着自然的原野，她深深的眸子，測着深深的天空，有時侯她傍倚着樹猝，有時侯她枕靠着大石，小溪是牠唯一的良伴，在樹畔溪邊，她跟我學唱，一春樹暮　是我你的相望，落月停　是我你的相思！海的夢，專屬我你！心頭是這樣的難　，身世是這樣的浮沉！欲留不得，欲去不能，苦海風波！流浪……飄泊：…」這是她以後每天哼着的歌，在一個多爾的黃昏。始凄慘的吿訴我，她爸爸去世了，更被逼着嫁給了不務正業的表哥，從此，溪邊不復有她的倩影，我只渺渺的聽見，她有了孩子，　頻頻的傳說，他們感情很好·我這東　西泊的人，又流浪到別處去了，她的消息也從此斷絕，我只在世界的一角，默　着她永遠幸福……在一個淸晨我接到一封由其鄕轉來的信！寫着：</p>
<p>我敬愛的先生！昔</p>
<p>日溪畔的朋友，一切的</p>
<p>不幸都未出乎意外，前年冬天我和表哥結了婚，他很好，竟馬上改變了昔日的浪蕩，我們有了個女孩子—小烟，很幸福，但木性難改，日久之後，小烟的爸爸終又每夜不歸，整日以嫖賭為業，如今，他愛上了交際名花，同去上海度蜜月了，而忍心的拋我不顧，這還不算，竟不先吿訴我，將我住的房子也出售了，直等今天買主夾催我搬冢才弄得，我母女沒路可走，我本想來找先生設法，但實在沒有顏面，如若先生肯為我設法救濟，請於三日內來我舊寓一次，三日後我即淪為飄泊為生的人了，斷　的浮萍將審生於何處也不得而知，再談吧！等着你的來臨！順祝近佳淡烟謹上</p>
<p>天呀！這信東轉西轉巳越過了兩星期，我仍不死心的跑到某鄉，那兒還有她的蹤跡，可是今天！我曾看見她！她！仍是那麼年輕，那麼天眞，但為什麼竟不理我！啊！酒醉誤了事，不然該追上她！問個究竟！</p>
<p>次日，我又在昨天遇見她的地方等她，但她宋一來，一日一日，希望漸漸的消滅了，茫茫天涯，竟斷了我倆的重逢嗎，於是我又狂飲那烈性的酒，讓生活更醉。更麻木！更無知！我自己也不知道，怎麼會醉倒在路畔，一覺醒來，　打　　，突然的眼前一亮。那海般深的　十，在我身邊閃動，那低低的聲普在我耳際飛機，「先生！醒過來了嗎？眞　死我了！」我定神再看，這年輕的生命，這天眞的姑娘，不是她是誰。牢牢的抓住她，　意散了，遮似　相　　臉，却覺得很生疏了！這是個陌牛的小姑娘，好奇的問了她，知這原來是們賣花的姑娘，她說她沒有姓，更不肯吿訴我呌什麼名字，我便成了她的老顧齊，有一天她把花送來了，很急的就想回去，我也不知道她有什麼事，故意留難她，請她把瓶裏的水換換，她也順從着去換了再走，以後每天如此，我問她的話也無暇回答我，有一天她不來了，我一直等到中午，却來了一個別人，從來未曾見過，她自已吿訴我，她是小烟的朋友小姻的母親病得很重，走不開，所以她代替送花來了，我瘋狂似的要她帶我局去小烟家，今天我才知道這賣花的姑娘就是小烟，我與這另外的小姑娘飛奔至一個里弄中，在低低的小屋中進去了，妙說這就是小烟的家，她自己却捧了花奔向別處去了，這小屋黑得瞧不見方向，半響我才看見東邊角上有黑影在蠕動，我忙呌小烟，這姑娘吿訴我，她母親的病危，那悽慘的聲音，使我回憶到這是殘冬時候，淡烟在訴說，馬上這姑娘拉我進另外一個小房中，綠陰陰的豆油燈下，聽見了病危的人，隊了海般深的眸子是熱悉的，什麼也不像了，我呆了，小烟在旁邊設：「媽！這就是每天買我花的先生！」那無力的病人微微的點頭感謝，突然支持了坐起來，拉着我的手，吃力的說：「你不是……不是…英…英先生嗎？你，你……忘了我了吧！…「我連忙止住她臥下，可是他還在說：「我…我永遠，永遠要休息了！讓稅把……把小烟托…托給你吧：求求尓…求你答應…答應我：我這……這最…後的哀求吧……」我暗然的揚着她那枯乾的手，傷心的點着頭，突然那乾枯的手一鬆，啊！淡烟！她！永遠休息了…。綠陰陰的豆油燈更加綠得可而了！啊！淡烟！我找尋了你十多年，今天總算找到了！重逢了！可是！烟，你眞和烟一樣溜散了，我這顆徬徨無依的心靈，將更孤獨和寂寞了，苦杯中餘瀝的苦味更濃了，生命的苦杯，殘餘的歲月，呌我怎敢再想，猛然的狂奔至附近的小酒店，坐下來，習慣的用烈性的酒，把自己埋在醉鄉，正舉起那自色的液，往口中直濯時，一個氣喘喘的聲音，微微而急促的說：「先生！幫助我以後的生活吧！」依在脚前的是小烟，我便茫然的付了酒錢，攙了小烟，飄飄然踏回黑黑的里弄中，低低的小屋顯在眼前，綠陰陰的油燈，在搖曳，突然息滅了，一切都在黑暗中……。</p>
<p>新月鈎在柳梢上，小星神秘的　眼，小烟凄凉的唱起：春樹暮雲是我你的相望，落月停雲是我你的相思！海的夢。專屬我</p>
<p>（春）（）（望）　·水漪·梅花在夜中啓示：道春已起程，寒風冷冷，寒水粉紛，難著春間光懼？×××梅花又在夜中啟示：道春已來臨，碧大靑，水仙盈盈，畢竟春光多勇勁。</p>

<h3>五路娘子軍參加公開籃球賽大華將為綠隊之勁敵華僑與三省實力相埒</h3>
<p>全滬公開藍球賽，於本月五日在八仙橋靑年會健身房展幕。各路雄師，各爭身手，球迷濟濟一室，盛况空前，尤以女子組大華康愛之戰，為觀衆極矚目之一幕。綠女子籃球，沉寂已久，有此盛况，良有意也。筆者為鼓勵提倡起見，特追評該賽簡情，並介紹三省華僑綠隊實力（加入者計五隊，大華康愛本刋已介紹）。先評述大華康愛之役：</p>
<p>評大華與康愛之戰</p>
<p>大華隊在會長楊叔鼎策劃下，一切均在軌道上前進，是日全部新裝，鮮艷奪目，精神煥發。康愛有李名煬指導，為聖約翰體育班同學所組織，雖屬本行，但習練時期尙短，稍見遜色耳。</p>
<p>該賽，大華恃其練習純熱之三角派司，不斷進攻。前鋒黃美娟黃鳳貞活躍非凡。康愛雖竭力抵禦，終以實力不逮，分數一落千丈。最後大華以情屬姊妹，當不能相煎太急，於是頻頻換人。一方面不事多求，一方面新人亦可藉此多得比賽經騐。自此大華得分當漸減少，然康愛仍不易入手。蓋能力相差仍遠，結果大華獲三十八分康愛僅得三分，亦云慘哉！</p>
<p>觀大華戰術確為有訓練之球隊。其攻多利用三角傳遞及擋人進攻頗見頭頭是道。其守衛用人釘人，十分緊凑。敵似難覓隙，故大華如能加緊努力，再接再萬，則本屆錦標當可與稱霸一時之綠隊互爭短長也。其個人技藝，前鋒黃美娟為最佳，非獨射籃準確，抑且姿勞美妙，其出手之快，更為其他女將所難望其項背。黃鳳貞地位跑得殊好，射籃亦具把握。沈淑維力道甚足，唯其功夫，似未見爐火純靑。守衛薛德音薛嫩音一對姊妹花，固守後方，如銅牆鐵壁，籃下截球，俱見有獨到之處。程慕蘭奔跑有餘，亦為守衛之良將。餘如黃美玉劉兆蘭鄧琪揺周芝芬，均為後起之秀，誠濟濟多士，康愛以王隱德之勇，稱絕全隊，而守衛王淡雲應為智勇兼全之上將·惜好花無綠葉相扶，徒見其空勞一番，然王小姐在籃球界之地位，我敢斷其必有成就也。</p>
<p>茲再介紹綠隊華僑三省三女子隊如後，俾球迷得窺女子組各隊實力。</p>
<p>三省——隸屬於三省體育會，歷史並不悠久，然隊員頗多體育學校出身，故能竿頭日進。自成立以來，每星期至少有兩次練習，自其演出，另當刮目相視，非復當年初成立時之一盤散沙矣。隊員史瑞娟係排球名將，自榮任三省女籃球隊隊長以後，即一心一意，注力於此，一日千里。其籃下托進之一記，十拿九穩，且彈性極佳，更能指揮為全隊靈魂。前鋒王福芝前山東市代表，可見其球藝之精湛，投籃之神速，有男子風。與綠隊黃明媛容淑儉及息影已久之　動，作風有異曲同工之妙。陳惠迪係東南體師高材生，自屬個中老手，運球最出色，與史隊長聯絡有素。故該隊前鋒相當強硬，後衛陸翠芳趙季臣身體魁捂，佔得搶球阻攔之便利。陳澤莊阻球運球另有一弓，然能在驚險中顯拿手好戲，史隊長譽之為標準後衛，信不誣也。餘如胡梅仙陳梅貞，俱屬排球界第一流好手，籃球塲上，尙少見芳蹤，以理度之，演出常能與排球一樣鋒茫畢露。練觀該隊實力，較大華綠隊稍弱，雖必有一番作為，在聯賽中可望克華僑而　　三席。</p>
<p>華僑——為華僑體育會軍旗幟下之新組織，會長黃生昌提倡有心，特邀籃球名將卓國榮為敎練。其隊員練習往常與男子隊同練，故長力頗堪驚人，在聯賽中雖不能出人頭地，然必能有相當成績。記者會觀該隊隊員作戰，頗覺全隊俱為後起之士。假以時日，必可成勁旅。勉之，其隊長謝麗健，顧其名可知其為健碩之輩，球　頗臻上乘，餘二鋒為張奇鳳胡秀波，極能射籃，後衛方面有吳愛蓮之把守，吳小姐身段修長，躍起接球　收事半功倍之效。黃　珍避人傳遞，亦有幾分顏色。林向志能衝前搶球，在守衝上為成功之途。　蘭珍為工女中之運動健將，對於羽毛球最具心得　得　球時間甚短，然以其天材，不致令人失望。全隊頗能上進，在聯賽中可力爭季軍地位。</p>
<p>綠隊——隊員均係球壇名將，在女子籃球壇上素有名望，本屆東山再起，並延錢旭滄為指導，謝益欽為管理，如魚得水，更見聲勞赫赫。論其陣容，鋒有容淑儉為體育界老將，短小精悍。左手投籃，有沈聿恭作風，守之殊艱。嚴蔚雯為前啓秀健將，衷氣極足，傳遞投籃，純熟之至，丈以態度和　，允為運動員中之模範。黃明媛身任隊長，身手矯健，有丈失風，能遠射，不可多得之人材。李離芝資格老練，衛有劉珍　為全滬投　比賽第一名，可見其程度，然本屆將退司　　　一以該隊前鋒人材特多。二則以珍寶之竄出搶球，妙到絲毫，必有優良表演，全材也。王維珍前為愛國隊隊柱，看人之緊，常者披靡，其作戰時英氣勃勃，决不肯羅人一步，然塲後頗見彬彬然也，注印蘭竺承然張　知，均為守衛之上好人材，汪擅截球·竺人長佔先，而張則勇敢善戰，本屆當能發揮其實力，保持過去令　。其唯一心腹之患，　唯大華耳。</p>
<p>總之，本屈聯賽中有上列五路娘子軍參加，自可添增不少盛况。在久已沉寂之女子運動，當以此為提倡之洗禮，至窺實力推測冠軍，必為　　　　之爭。華僑與三省實力相埓，常有發展。康愛技術稱差，或將屈居人後。然以其體格之佳，經相當時期，或有非我人臆料之成續。然則每星期日（必有一塲）之騖騖燕燕，競爭必烈，故不憚其煩，介紹如上，想為球迷所樂讀歟？（梅潔）</p>
<h3>觀上週足球賽</h3>
<p>上週足球賽有聯賽第二循環之二幕，華人兩巨頭東華聯誼均出兵，結果東華雖兵張馬壯僅小勝雛鳳三省一球，聯誼曾以三對二勝僑聯，最後連失三關慘敗，自有其理焉。記者不避私見，書述於后。</p>
<p>東華先現鬆懈繼則心切驚慌</p>
<p>東華逢三省，上週六下午在膠園舉行，事前皆以為賽必一面倒。蓋東華為常勝軍，三省則屢戰屢北，事實上冠殿軍之分，勝負之判，不言可喻。然結果相反，東華僅以一球險勝，其理無他，緣是戰東華先存穩勝輕敵之心，油然而生，戰來不免鬆懈。如韓能海不用其全力以竄，李堯更有氣無力，不若遇強敵時之努力，致前鋒綫上，徒見枉費心血。反之，三省在王神父指導之下，用新戰術，出奇制勝，以麥爾森死釘韓龍海，徐國福趨緊孫錦順。蓋自知技術不如人，而球員年事正輕，長力充沛，故如此阻其前路，確有見地，以此上半時中，東華竟一無所獲。下半時中，東華因孫錦順受舊離塲，戴麟經不得不戎裝助陣，全隊始用全副精神，唯鑒於上半時之驚險，乃有獲球心切而現慌亂之象。最後僅以二對一倖勝。夫東華如能上半時中不鬆懈於先，下半時不須有驚慌之現象，當可多獲幾球，唯三省之臨大敵而不怠戰，值得稱頌，再東華於聯賽錦標，已有八分把握，所望者，毋驕毋餒，能保持資勝威銜，造成一頁更可常之球史，則大佳事。</p>
<p>聯誼先勝後敗未能鎭靜所致</p>
<p>聯誼僑聯之戰，上週星期日上午在逸園交鋒，觀衆極為擁擠，兩隊俱為強隊，尤以僑聯用淸一色義將，故吸引力殊大。此戰演出而論，戰局始終在攻守俱佳之過程中，聯誼宋靈聖僑聯鮑傑為兩隊攻守之魂，戰來有聲有色，觀衆讃嘆不已。下半時聯誼以三對二領先時，如能以守為本，以攻為輔，或能保持勝局。乃該隊味取攻，致為僑聯扳成和局，嗣後更以少數健兒，心理上突起變化，乃有犯規行動。吳祺祥更以重傷出塲，此皆頭腦不能冷靜所致，而僑聯則乘機大事進襲，再奪二城，聯誼以三對五敗績矣。</p>
<p>塲外人多事幾釀全武行</p>
<p>聯僑一役，最可憾者，場外有一種人亦附合亂吵，致與球員間大起衝突，最後更以武力威脅，大不足取，因此幾　事件，幸各主持人竭力排解，乃吿平息。猶憶前年膠園逸　事件，尙熒迥腦際，今日，重演此項事件，不勝感慨係之。記者深願球員方面，知所自勉，不良行動，有則改之，無則加勉，更切盼塲外看客，莫作莫須有之吵鬧，蓋球賽一切自有裁判及當局負責也。（瘦記者）</p>

<h3>Promptly Establish Organs of Public Opinion</h3>
<p>The government, in order to respect public opinion, should promptly establish organs of public opinion, both at the central and local levels. This is a consistent stance of this newspaper. In the past, we have repeatedly discussed and suggested this in terms of both theory and implementation. Here, we will quote ourselves again as follows:</p>
<p>On January 9th of last year, when the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, our newspaper's editorial, titled "On Entering the War," argued that the issue of greatest concern to the people was: What will happen after entering the war? We offered the authorities two points: First, respect public opinion. Now that entering the war has been determined as a national policy, everything related to the future of the nation and the lives of the people must widely solicit public opinion and obtain the full understanding of the people. The people are the most important and ultimate deciding force. The thorough implementation of national policies and the execution of government orders will never proceed smoothly or be successfully completed without the active and voluntary participation and support of the people. If we do not want national policies to be separate from the people, with the two not in harmony, then everything in the future must widely solicit public opinion, gather the essence, and especially give full play to the power of the people. Only by respecting public opinion in this way can we realize national policies and strive for victory.</p>
<p>On September 9th of last year, eight months after entering the war, our newspaper's editorial, titled "Reflections on Eight Months of War," objectively analyzed the past in four points. The third point pointed out that wartime politics had not yet shown effective performance. Although there had been adjustments to the political system, real efficiency had not been achieved. The main reason for this was the continued separation from the interests of the people. Therefore, as long as the people do not have the opportunity to participate in politics, public opinion cannot be effectively expressed, and a gap still exists between government measures and public opinion.</p>
<p>On July 6th of last year, before the imminent takeover of the concessions, our newspaper's editorial, titled "The Construction of a New Shanghai and Organs of Public Opinion," argued that establishing a genuine organ of public opinion in a new Shanghai was particularly important and must be prepared early so that it could be quickly realized. This would assist the government. This organ of public opinion must possess several basic conditions. First, its powers must be clearly defined. It must have the power to assist the government in investigating and designing all municipal facilities, provide opinions to the government, and supervise special public welfare undertakings and facilities. We believe that only by establishing an organ of public opinion endowed with such powers can it be the eyes and ears of the government and the voice of the people, enabling the government's policies to be supported by the people and the people's hardships and demands to be understood by the government. Only in this way can we effectively concentrate the power of officials and the people and jointly shoulder the construction of a new Shanghai. Otherwise, if the government is detached from the people, any construction is out of the question. Second, in terms of organization, it must be rigorous and flexible. It does not necessarily have to have a large form and structure, but it must be convenient for performing its work and exerting its effectiveness. At the same time, in order to realize this requirement, the organizational structure of this organ of public opinion must also avoid bureaucratism and officialdom. In terms of personnel selection, it must be especially cautious. It must elect leaders and specialists who can represent the people and are trusted and respected by the people from among the genuine citizens.</p>
<p>The above-quoted words are all our past arguments for establishing organs of public opinion. We further observe that all countries in Greater East Asia have organs of public opinion of a similar nature, such as our ally Japan, which has the Diet and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. The newly emerging Philippines and Burma have Congress. The natives of Malaya, Java, and other places also have senates. Even in Chongqing, although the Kuomintang monopolizes power, there is also the establishment of a "Political Council." We believe that all wise governments must value public opinion and have a diet, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, etc. The newly emerging Philippines and Burma have congresses, etc. Indigenous people in Malaya, Java and other places have senates, etc. This is the best way to promote government orders. Moreover, during this wartime, it is especially necessary for the people to cooperate thoroughly in order to ensure victory.</p>
<p>Secondly, as far as Shanghai is concerned, its importance goes without saying. In the past, the municipal government had a council, and the concessions had a board of directors, a public works bureau, a tax-payers association, etc., which were also institutions for expressing public opinion. Since the takeover of the concessions in August of last year, Mayor Chen has also stated that the establishment of an organ of public opinion is necessary and can be established in six months without further consideration. However, time has passed, and we have not yet seen the establishment of an organ of public opinion. For the sake of Shanghai's future and to fulfill the task of an important rear base during the war, the delayed establishment of an organ of public opinion cannot but be a regrettable matter. We have repeatedly offered suggestions for the ideal organ of public opinion. Here, we will briefly reiterate and supplement our opinions as follows:</p>
<p>The selection of representatives should be based solely on the condition that they are trusted by the people. Currently, due to environmental constraints, it is not possible to have a public election, so the municipal government should designate and invite them, but it must break with the concepts of party affiliation, hometown, and region.</p>
<p>Shanghai is an economic center, and it should be centered on people from the private economic sector. In addition to the Kuomintang, outstanding elements from other parties such as the Youth Party and the National Socialist Party should also be recruited.</p>
<p>Various specialized committees should be established within the organ of public opinion to discuss and suggest various specialized issues, such as finance, economy, public utilities, public security, culture, education, social welfare, health, etc. Experts from various departments and experienced people should be invited to serve.</p>
<p>In the past two or three years, there has been very little contact between the municipal government and the people, which is a great regret. If an organ of public opinion is established, the authorities and the people will have regular opportunities for contact, which will naturally lead to close ties and eliminate the gap between officials and the people. In addition, there are quite a few Japanese expatriates living in Shanghai, and in order to further achieve close coordination in building a Greater Shanghai, it is also necessary to communicate as much as possible with the opinions of Allied expatriates. We should have regular contact with Allied expatriate leaders and organize and hold regular gatherings of a consultative nature, listening to opinions on the one hand and explaining government orders on the other, so that there is absolutely no gap between the two sides.</p>
<p>Finally, we advocate that in order to achieve a clear political situation, innovation is the most important thing. As far as Shanghai is concerned, the first is political innovation, the second is economic innovation, and the third is the establishment of an organ of public opinion, so that we can ensure public security and gradually achieve the ideal Greater Shanghai. At the same time, only with such steps can we unleash economic power, fulfill the mission of an important rear base, and contribute to the victory of the Greater East Asia War!</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Intercept Enemy Reinforcements and Advance Fiercely Towards Chittagong; 10,000 British Troops Surrounded Near Taung Bazaar</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain base on the Burmese front: After completing its mission of providing flank cover during the battle near Taung Bazaar in the Chin Hills, a certain Japanese unit is now advancing fiercely towards Chittagong from the Hakha area. At the same time, a certain Japanese unit pursuing the defeated enemy and advancing north from the Kaladan River Valley, in response to the former, is continuing its rapid advance under the enemy's intense retreat-covering fire and with close coordination from another unit that is intercepting attacks from the side on the right bank of the river. It has passed Kengin and is currently attacking a certain strategic location. Moreover, the Japanese troops in this area on the right bank of the river have also begun operations, advancing from the north of Minbya and Inbauk. Therefore, the enemy's 81st West African Division, which is stirring in the Kaladan River Valley in an attempt to reverse the decline in Arakan, and the enemy's 3rd Division, which is launching an offensive towards Arakan, are facing annihilation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain Japanese base on the Burmese front: Approximately 10,000 troops of the main force of the British Indian 17th Division near Taung Bazaar have recently been surrounded by Japanese troops. The Japanese army is launching a fierce offensive by air and land. That is, the Japanese army units defeated the stubborn resistance of the enemy army to the east of Taung Bazaar and inflicted annihilation blows. On the morning of the 14th, at 9:00 a.m., the Japanese army further occupied the area north of the area in a melee, completely cutting off the retreat route of the enemy army in the Tiddim and Taung Bazaar areas, and launched a severe annihilation battle, causing a major fire in the enemy army's military facilities in Taung Bazaar. Another unit fiercely attacked a powerful enemy unit possessing tanks and self-propelled artillery near Sinkin, 3 kilometers northwest of Taung Bazaar on the morning of the 14th. It attacked the enemy army advancing north near a certain key road, causing it to fall into great chaos, capturing hundreds of its trucks. Although the enemy army is rushing left and right in the Japanese army's encirclement, its annihilation is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Southeast Asia Allied Forces Command announced in a battle situation communique on the 15th that a fierce bayonet fight has broken out between the Japanese army and the anti-Axis forces in the northern area of Buthidaung.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the frontline in the Indian Ocean, their importance has greatly increased with the progress of the war situation on the Burmese-Indian border. The Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Commander, Mountbatten, is still trying to cover up the failure of the land war in an attempt to reverse the decline. It seems that he intends to carry out a maritime roundabout operation to acquire a base on the two archipelagos and to heavily publicize the Burmese counter-offensive operation. If a large-scale naval force is used in the Bay of Bengal, it can break through the Arakan Mountains. These two archipelagos are the strategic line for crushing the enemy's defense of the Greater East Asia resource zone and are also a major fortress for controlling the sea and air power in the Bay of Bengal. Therefore, they are called the Bay of Bengal Fortress Line. In March of Showa 17 (1942), the Japanese army advanced into the two archipelagos. For two years since then, the defense works have been extremely strong. The main islands include North, South, Small, and Middle Andaman Islands, and Car Nicobar, South Kori, and Great Nicobar Islands. All of these are small islands of less than 1,000 square kilometers. Port Blair, the capital, is the best developed. Except for Car Nicobar Island, other birds are mostly forested and cannot immediately become land-based air bases. Due to this geographical environment, they have the characteristics of a special fortress line. Even if the enemy successfully landed on one of them, it would be difficult to build a flying base and would only become the bait of the Japanese navy and air force. Currently, the bombing and reconnaissance battles between the Japanese and British air forces are in full swing in the Bay of Bengal. Once the war situation in the Indian Ocean matures, this modern maritime fortress line can be proven to be absolutely impregnable. If Mountbatten attempts to launch a counter-offensive from the sea, it is expected to be crushed by the Japanese army, which will instead facilitate the Japanese army's capture of India.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese troops on Bougainville Island have been attacking the main positions of the enemy troops around Torokina since last Sunday. After occupying a certain height of 600 meters above sea level on the 10th, they continued to attack the enemy's main positions on a certain height. On the 13th, they launched a night attack, breaking through the enemy's positions west of the height, and are continuing to attack their main positions from behind. Since the enemy has been attacked by the Japanese army, it has been quite embarrassed. It began on the 11th to cooperate with naval artillery in land operations and attempted to reinforce its forces. However, these enemy boats reinforcing from the sea are simply good targets for the Japanese artillery. Moreover, when the Japanese army occupied a certain height of 600 meters above sea level on the 10th, the enemy army abandoned more than 300 corpses. The Japanese army also captured six mortars, four machine guns, one hundred automatic rifles, and a large number of other weapons and ammunition. The Japanese army suffered only sixty-odd casualties. Also, when attacking a certain height on the 11th, the enemy army abandoned more than one hundred corpses. In total, since the start of the operation on the 8th, the enemy army has suffered approximately eight or nine hundred casualties.</p>

<h3>Original Text of the Judgment in the Case of Corruption by Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) Also, on February 20 of the same year, Hou Dachun, the commander of the Zhenrong No. 2629 unit, established a contract to purchase 10,000 tons of rice, requisitioned in the three counties of Wuxian, Wujiang, and Wuxi, using a total purchase fund of 32,396,127 yuan. The Rong unit only handed over 27,381,084 yuan, resulting in a loss of 5,015,43 yuan. In addition, the interest was 757,167 yuan, for a total loss of 5,772,210 yuan. The Rong unit had promised to allocate materials such as matches, soap, wax, cigarettes, sugar, and cotton cloth, equivalent to one-sixth of the rice purchase price, to the rice farmers. However, after Hou Dachun accepted the materials, he only allocated 30% of them to the rice farmers, and the remaining 70% was used for trafficking and profiteering, gaining a net profit of 7,789,501 yuan. After compensating for the previous loss, he actually obtained an illegal profit of 2,774,458 yuan, 5 jiao, 3 fen, and 8 li. Also, in early May of the same year, Hou Dachun, at the instigation of Zhu Zicheng, the director of the Kunshan Flour Mill Industry Association, withdrew 3,500,000 yuan from the 45,000,000 yuan of the Ministry of Food's rice purchase fund to purchase 12,910 bags of flour. In mid-August of the same year, Tang Lianhou, the manager of the Wanfeng Grain Store that he set up himself, moved the flour out of the South Wing area and sold it to the merchant Zhang Chusheng, gaining a net profit of approximately 1,400,000 yuan, which caused the aforementioned flour to illegally flow into the Shanghai area. Also, in March of the same year, Hou Dachun was introduced by Geng Jia to the iron rice merchant Shen Linqing. In April of the same year, he paid him 6,000,000 yuan (Jiangsu Local Bank checks) from the rice purchase fund sent by the Ministry of Food to allow him to requisition 15,000 shi of rice in Suzhou. Hu Zheng took office as the head of the Sales Office in the same month. Hou Dachun also introduced Shen Linqing to him to purchase a large amount of rice at a low price and then turn it over to the Food Bureau and the Sales Office when the market price rose. It is estimated that approximately 1,780 shi were purchased in Qingpu and 3,000 shi were purchased and resold in Jiashan. Subsequently, Shen Linqing gave Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng 540,000 yuan each in June of the same year and also gave Hou Dachun a car. At the end of the same month, Hu Zheng transferred another 875,000 yuan to Hou Dachun. After transferring 500,000 yuan to others, Hou Dachun obtained the remaining amount for himself.

<h3>Random Talk on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>— Tokutomi Sohō</p>
<p>Humans are the most intelligent of all beings, controlling and utilizing all things. This goes without saying. However, when it comes to the grand plan of our Japanese military state, people must often be regarded as things. Regarding the issue of quantity, since Sun Tzu, it has become the most important thing for military strategists. Therefore, the increase in population is the highest task for governing the country and bringing peace to the world. In other words, for a country like Japan, even during wartime, or rather, precisely because it is wartime, the population growth rate has actually increased, with an increase of two million people every year. This truly cannot but make us thank heaven and earth.</p>
<p>However, no matter how important human resources are, we cannot expect someone holding a baby to carry a large cannon. What we want to advocate here is a point about age dedication. However, age dedication is by no means unlimited. At least men and women over the age of thirty should each dedicate ten years of their lives, and the age they dedicate is a contribution to the nation. Dedicating ten years means that someone who is thirty years old becomes twenty, someone who is forty becomes thirty, and so on, decreasing in the same way. Someone who is fifty becomes forty, sixty becomes fifty, and seventy becomes sixty. An old man like me, who is eighty-two years old, naturally becomes a seventy-two-year-old man. Those over ninety years old are an exception. If age is reduced in this way, and the past retirement system is completely revised accordingly, then those who have previously retired will have to return to the ranks. Even those who are about to retire can extend their term of service. All these results are for the sake of the country, and naturally human resources will increase.</p>
<p>The reason why the past retirement system was established was to provide an opportunity for newcomers to enter the workforce. However, in today's situation where work is piled up like mountains, and even cats and dogs are being driven to serve, it is naturally impossible to talk about paving the way for newcomers. There should be many opportunities for newcomers to advance. Young people must work, so old people should not work. Saying such things is like limiting childbirth, which can be said to be the extreme of pessimism. Originally, those whose muscles and bones have not yet weakened, whose abilities are still intact, and whose experience and skill increase with age, are abandoned without hesitation and allowed to retire, while paying extra pensions and allowing them to be idle. This is truly an extremely irrational phenomenon in terms of human resource economics. Even in peacetime, it is unavoidable to do this, which is already as erroneous as the most unreasonable theory of birth control that once swept the world. Then, in today's emergency, such fallacies should be quickly swept away and cleared up.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people say that this is indeed very suitable for the elderly, but it is not appropriate for the strong. If I, the author, am an old man, and I am saying a few words in support of the elderly from the standpoint of protecting the elderly, then this is a great injustice. We are in such an emergency today and absolutely do not need to have distinctions between classes, men and women, old and young, etc. Just because someone is old, they cannot do this, or because someone is strong, they must do this, or women are not allowed to do outdoor work, etc. These are ultimately things of peacetime. Today, we should no longer value age. This can be clearly understood by looking at the so-called juvenile air force. Look at the young students who have not yet graduated from middle school, constantly transforming into juvenile air force, and killing enemies and achieving results on the front lines. You can know that when necessary, age is not a problem. Conversely, it can be said that the younger the person, the more useful they are. If young people are like this, then old people are naturally like this too. If young people are useful, then old people are naturally also useful.</p>
<p>War is by no means simple. To conduct a war, if you estimate the work of the front and the rear, then all the complex work, such as large and small vehicles, large and small wheels, must be artistically and comprehensively coordinated to proceed. Therefore, in today's era, age should never be the standard for whether to serve. We must see whether it is suitable for the work, that is the standard. However, some jobs especially require energetic people, while other jobs are not necessarily limited to people of a certain age. For the job itself, it is enough to find someone who can take on the responsibility. Therefore, we have always advocated the adoption of new people, but this does not mean that we should abandon old people. Now the Soviet Union and Britain have expanded the age of employment to sixty years old. Looking at it this way, why don't we implement the theory of age dedication? Those who worry that old people will steal the jobs of young people, or that women will steal the jobs of men, and therefore advocate that those who undertake current duties should be reduced to the minimum, not only narrowly understand the meaning of the national total war, but also hinder and destroy the highest purpose of the total war. In extraordinary times, we must work in the way of extraordinary times. (Translated by Lu from the February 9th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Ambassador Tani states that Japan spares no support for collaborative construction of new China</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, previously toured Southern China, Northern China, Mengjiang, Hankou, and other places following the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China. This tour has now concluded, and he arrived in Shanghai by car at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 16th). He plans to stay for two or three days before returning to his post in Beijing. The following is a record of his remarks made to the press corps yesterday:</p>
<p>The National Government has formally begun implementing wartime price control measures, as evidenced by the recent punishment of corrupt officials. This shows that the National Government's political power is on track, and the people's trust in the National Government has been strengthened as a result, which is cause for great celebration. Japan's new policy towards China is being implemented one by one with the deep understanding of all Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians. However, the degree of its prevalence varies due to regional relations, which is unavoidable, or due to differences in national and social conditions. Some regions have their own characteristics, so the degree of prevalence in each region is not consistent. However, in the future, I firmly believe that the true meaning of Japan's new policy towards China will become increasingly clear, and in the near future, it will be thoroughly understood by the people. Therefore, issues such as overall peace are all internal affairs of the National Government, and Japan only takes a bystander attitude. We are determined to work sincerely to realize the new policy. It will still take some time for the people under the rule of the Chongqing side to understand this sincerity. At least during the Greater East Asia War, there is little hope. However, before people understand it, they will be shown sincerity to guide them. I firmly believe that the day they understand it will be the day that all Chinese people truly realize that they are one of the peoples of Greater East Asia. The Chongqing side is currently only following the lead of the United Kingdom and the United States. In the future, they will surely realize that only the United Kingdom and the United States are the enemies of East Asia. For the sake of the revival of China, all economic support that Japan gives to China must be promoted more actively. Before its specific realization, whether it is in terms of price control measures or industrial revitalization measures in Central China, it is expected that there will still be considerable difficulties. Under these circumstances, Japan will never stand idly by and watch. In order to cooperate in the construction of a new China, it is determined to spare no support.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Control Committee Rewards Purchase of Rice Grain, Incentive Money Paid in Three Installments</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the purchasing mechanism, complete the purchasing work, and maintain the food supply for civilians and the military, the Rice and Grain Control Committee, in addition to implementing the exchange of daily necessities for the purchase of rice grain, has specially formulated the "Measures for Handling Incentive Money for the Purchase of Rice Grain:" The Rice and Grain Control Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Rice Control Committee) maintains close contact with the Rural Clearing Affairs Bureau and relevant military departments. In the rural clearing areas of Area A, each county is designated as a unit, and the quantity of rice grain that should be distributed is determined. The quantity to be undertaken by each county stipulated in the above regulations is instructed by the Rice Control Committee to the purchasing merchants in each locality, and the military department and the relevant government offices of the rural clearing area separately notify the liaison department and the county government. The trade association is responsible for purchasing rice grain in accordance with various regulations, and the relevant administrative officials only provide goodwill assistance in persuading farmers to provide rice grain, so as to achieve the expected purchasing target. The rice grain management and payment of funds should not be interfered with in any way, but the township and town chiefs and below should be responsible for guaranteeing the quantity distributed in their respective jurisdictions. In order to implement the above methods and make them have close contact with each other, the Rice Control Committee should promptly send a copy of the rice grain purchasing permit and rice grain transportation passport to the relevant government authorities for reference. When the administrative officials exceed the designated distribution quantity due to their strict and appropriate handling of the tasks described in the lower section of the third item, the Rice Control Committee shall give incentive money. The incentive money allocated to the counties that meet the qualifications in the preceding paragraph shall be 15/1000 or more of the purchase price, up to 20/1000. When deciding on the award-winning county, in addition to the reports of the military department and government officials, the reports of the purchasing merchants should also be used as information. The incentive money is divided into three installments: before the end of December, before the end of the lunar New Year, and before the end of the rice killing year. The money will be allocated to the award winners after review and decision based on the distribution quantity in each period. The payment of the bonus will be decided and implemented by a committee composed of the chairman of the deliberation committee, the chairman of the Rice Control Committee, the director of the Rice Control Committee, the general army, and the representative of the embassy.</p>
<h3>Reissuing of Residence Certificates Has Begun</h3>
<p>It is reported that the reissuing of residence certificates in District 1 has already begun. The authorities of each Baojia district have separately issued new certificate application forms to each Lianbao and Baojia chief, who will forward them to each household to fill out. After filling them out and submitting them, the Baojia section of the police station will specify a date and order people to collect the new certificates, and at the same time return the old citizen certificates. Furthermore, it is understood that the Xinza District and other Baojia districts have formally issued new-style residence certificates to some citizens who have moved in from other districts. In addition to the authorities of each district issuing them, their style is similar to the old citizen certificates, but their paper and color are slightly different, and they have been changed to yellow.</p>
<h3>Replacement of Street Signs Can Be Completed by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>According to a Times reporter, the dismantling of British and American street signs in District 1 and the former eight districts is expected to yield 16 tons of iron material. Before the end of this month, 1,800 street signs in this city can be reinstalled. At that time, the sign frames and sign faces will be replaced. The former will be replaced with wood, and the latter will be changed to cement. The Public Works Department is actively engaged in dismantling. It is said that a total of 250 roads will have their names changed. Each road has multiple street signs. District 1 has 800, and the former eight districts have 1,000. These street signs only have the Chinese road names filled in.</p>
<h3>The District 1 Public Office Revises the Price of Bread</h3>
<p>The District 1 Public Office has revised the price of bread and flour sold within the district from March 18 of this year as follows:</p>
<p>White bread: Wholesale price is 13.20 yuan per pound in national currency, and the retail price is 14 yuan per pound in national currency, both without packaging. If packaging is required, an additional 1 yuan per pound in national currency will be charged. The weight of the bread should be calculated proportionally to the pound, whether it is less than or more than one pound. The rationed flour received by each bakery company is only allowed to be used to bake white bread of eight ounces, twelve ounces, and six ounces, twenty-four ounces, and thirty-two ounces.</p>
<p>First-class flour: One jin per ticket is sold for 11 yuan in national currency, without packaging, based on the flour coupon attached to the bread purchase certificate. According to the office, the reason for approving the revised price of bread this time is the increase in the price of flour, yeast, and fuel.</p>
<h3>The First Police Bureau Prepares to Establish a Consumer Cooperative, Held a Forum Yesterday to Invite Representatives from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: The consumer cooperative of the First Police Bureau of this city held a forum at the Police Club at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 16th) to invite leaders from the financial, commercial, and news sectors of this city. More than 100 people attended, including Kai Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Li Sihao, Guo Shun, Chen Binhe, Xiong Bai, and Xu Liqiu. The vice chairman of the cooperative, Du Zhengjian Su Chengde, and all directors and supervisors warmly welcomed them.</p>
<p>Du Zhengjian delivered a speech</p>
<p>Briefly stated that the establishment of the consumer cooperative was due to the recent soaring prices, which threatened the general public, and the lives of the police and their families were also greatly affected. However, the police bear the heavy responsibility of maintaining law and order, so it is necessary to stabilize their lives and improve police administration, eliminate the past bad impressions, and then ensure local law and order. At the same time, it is hoped that major manufacturers will provide more assistance to the establishment of the cooperative.</p>
<p>Su Chengde delivered a speech</p>
<p>Stating briefly (omitted above) that since the takeover of the concessions, the police administration of the 18th and Western Shanghai districts has been unified, reducing the suffering of the citizens from the inconsistency of police administration in the past. The improvement of police administration must first focus on the police system and police education, but the current life of the police has become a major problem. In recent months, I have been urging my subordinates at all times to seek benefits for the 5 million citizens and to obey police ethics and serve the society. However, their lives must also be taken care of. The daily increase in the cost of living is self-evident. The current salary of the police is more than 1,200 yuan per month per person, which is not a small amount, but compared with the current cost of living index, it is shocking. Under such a life, the situation of the police officers is naturally difficult. On the one hand, the government's funds are limited and there is no way to increase them, so there is the organization of a consumer cooperative, which strives to distribute daily necessities such as rice and coal at parity prices in order to stabilize the lives of the police and ensure the security of Greater Shanghai. Regarding the raising of large capital and the distribution of daily necessities to more than 10,000 police officers, please assist.</p>
<h3>Special Consumption Tax in Various Districts of Three Provinces Is Planned to Be Levied Next Month, It Has Been Submitted to the Ministry of Finance for Approval</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance was ordered to handle the special consumption tax at the time. From January 16 of this year, it was levied in advance in 15 important cities in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Bengbu, on retail goods and banquet hotels. Since then, it has been two months, and the implementation of the tax administration has been quite smooth, and the tax revenue has been very good. It is now understood that the department plans to universally levy the special consumption tax in other counties and towns in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui from next month, and has now submitted it to the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<h3>Recommend Design Committee Members</h3>
<p>Following that, Wen Lanting, Li Sihao, and Lin Kanghou delivered speeches, briefly stating that the police protect local law and order, and if the lives of the police cannot be stabilized, it will inevitably affect law and order, so the citizens should provide assistance and are happy to provide assistance. Finally, Chen Binhe proposed that everyone present be supporting members, and that a design committee be organized among the supporting members to be responsible for assisting the establishment of the consumer cooperative of the First Bureau. As a result, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Lvdeng, Tang Shoumin, Chen Binhe, and other eighteen people were appointed as design committee members. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Murderer in the Yamazaki Hotel Case is Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Wu Wen, the former Dean of Academic Affairs of the Central Police Academy, designed and lured Chen Wantong, an employee of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, to Shanghai in early October of last year, and murdered him in the Yamazaki Hotel, a Japanese business on Wujin Road. After the incident, the Judicial Section of the Hongkou Police Department of this city sent personnel to Beijing to find a way to arrest Wu and transfer him to Shanghai. The local procuratorate found the facts to be true after investigation, and filed a public prosecution with the local court for three crimes: premeditated murder and theft. Judge Chuan Lan conducted a trial and concluded the case, and the sentence was determined at a fixed time. This morning was the date of the judgment. The presiding judge read out the main text of the judgment. The defendant, Wu Wen, was sentenced to death for the crime of murder, and sentenced to two months of imprisonment for the crime of theft, to be executed concurrently with the death penalty, and deprived of political rights for life.</p>
<h3>The Old Eight Districts Improve Air Defense Street Lights, Most of Them Have Been Reinstalled</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Since the long-term lighting control began in this city on the 3rd of this month, the city has fallen into darkness every evening. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters of the City, together with the police sub-bureaus, sent personnel to patrol at any time, and the situation was quite good. However, the air defense street lights in the old eight districts used the method of forced light, and only a line of light remained, and the surrounding area was still extremely dark, which was extremely inconvenient for pedestrians. Therefore, the Civil Air Defense Headquarters of the City summoned the street light management authorities of the district to discuss the method, and changed to the District 1 air defense light method for improvement. Most of them have been completed, and the Japanese Army authorities, together with the Air Defense Headquarters and the police bureau in charge, inspected the district for a week last night and were satisfied.</p>
<h3>The Security Office Cracks Down on a Drug Production Organization</h3>

After several hours of strict search, the medicine dealer began to transport all the machines, chemical raw materials, etc., and the engineer Jiang Henian, the accountant Luo Quanzhi, and the suspects Xu Weiqing, Luo Bingchu, Zhu Hao, Luo Fengshi, and other six prisoners were completely detained by the team. On the 9th of this month, they went to Song Park Road to arrest Jianhua Xieji, and when they arrived, the toxic atmosphere outside the house overflowed, causing people to cover their noses. Knowing that the factory was manufacturing drugs, they did not allow a moment's delay, and the officers rushed into the fence and took the staff working at the organization Wang Shaoxing, Zhang Zhiqian, Shi Zhiqing, Yin Yinru, Wang Dingzhang, Xu Hekun, Mei Haida, Wang Zhangdong, Lu Zhang, Li Fusheng, Kang Chuanxi, Wu Jiefu and other twelve people, and 338 taels of manufactured heroin, plus the machines and raw materials, were taken to the team. According to the confession, the main criminal engineer and others were at large, and their whereabouts were usually secretive and they did not often go to the factory. They hired ignorant coolies to manufacture harmful drugs, which was a heinous crime that could not be tolerated by the law. The team is still continuing to order officers to go out and conduct strict investigations. It is reported that all the seized evidence and prisoners have been sent to the procuratorate of this city to await legal punishment.</p>

<h3>Major Commodities May Not Be Applied for Loan Collateral</h3>
<p>In order to suppress commodity prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the government's rich bureaus have decided to thoroughly investigate hoarding and crack down on speculation as the main goals. Since the Central Reserve Bank implemented tight lending and inspected the financial affairs offices to restrict financial institutions from lending business and not to undertake major commodity mortgage loans, not only has the trend of hoarding and speculation been curbed slightly, but also the major commodity mortgage loans that have already been undertaken have been urgently recovered. Therefore, in recent days, some people who have used the funds of the silver money industry to hoard goods have reduced prices and sold them, and market prices have continued to fall as a result. Therefore, the measures to contract floating capital and suppress commodity prices have achieved great results. It is heard that the Central Reserve Bank has decided to strictly review the purpose of the merchants applying for interbank lending and the types of collateral before approving the lending of interbank lending and post-loan business of financial institutions. If there are those who apply for mortgage loans with major commodities or are suspected of hoarding and speculating, they will be strictly rejected.</p>
<h3>Each Guild Strictly Prohibits Illegal Transactions</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that the establishment of markets by various trade guilds was originally intended to facilitate the centralized buying and selling by members of the same trade, all sales to merchants or by merchants to shops must be transacted in accordance with the established rules, and all transactions are limited to spot goods. It is absolutely forbidden to exceed the officially set price limit. Recently, it has been discovered that people outside the trade are selling in the market without authorization, which is highly inappropriate. However, such incidents have always been prohibited. Therefore, all member businesses must not trade with people outside the trade; violators will be punished.</p>
<h3>Firewood Factories' Monthly Production Only Reaches 30%</h3>
<p>There are currently twelve match factories in this city (excluding the Meiguang Factory). Among them, the four newly established factories, Swiss Ruiming Hongji Fuxin, are relatively small in scale, and their business scope is limited to the city. They only produce 500 cases per day. The other factories, namely Zhonghua (125 cases per day), Daming (155 cases), Guanghua (150 cases), Hongsheng (100 cases), Tongsui (85 cases), Zhongguo (60 cases), Dahua (45 cases), and Zhongnan (15 cases), produce a total of 735 cases. However, recently, due to difficulties in obtaining raw materials, daily production has only reached 30%, or just over 5,000 cases.</p>

<h3>First Line in the South Pacific: A Jungle Military Journal</h3>
<p>"Inside the first airfield of the allied forces surrounded by dense forests," this dispatch writes. "The enemy's first line is about 100 meters away, crossing the forest in front of us. The trenches where we are located are filled with rainwater due to heavy rains every day, and our lower bodies are soaked in mud. Such trenches can be seen everywhere in this forest of Torokina, where ancient axes have passed." In this camp, there is a fighting spirit as firm as iron.</p>
<p>The steadfastness of the soldiers in the jungle is for the world's strongest Japanese soldiers. The enemy sacrificed more than twenty aircraft carriers and occupied a corner of Torokina on November 1st of last year. It has been more than four months since then. During this long period, the soldiers on the Japanese first line, despite the fierce attacks of the enemy air force, are still defending this first line. They are waiting to open a path in this forest, so that a large number of artillery and bullets can be transported from the rear to annihilate the enemy.</p>
<p>Since the enemy landed, the forest has been bombed blindly for many days and is still burning. Even as I write this dispatch, I can hear the enemy planes bombing, splitting large trees and shaking the earth. Each bombing causes whirlpools in the mud of the trenches, and mud and water splash onto the soldiers' shoulders. If we had airplanes, artillery, and bullets, we would never allow the enemy to run wild. Under the enemy planes' bombs, which are roaring over Savo, a soldier in the mud shouted, "They're coming!" In an instant, he grabbed his shining bayonet with his left hand and jumped out of the trench.</p>
<p>Night Marching Under Lightning</p>
<p>The bloody battle of Torokina is a battle of airplanes, rifles, and bayonets. Why is there such a battle? Because this island refuses land transportation for thousands of years, and lets ancient forests grow freely. We know very well how difficult it is to maneuver in the dense forest, because we have sneaked through more than 120 kilometers from Buen to Torokina. The entire way is a dark forest, like daytime and nighttime. It took more than ten days to reach our destination. Our hands and feet were bleeding from thorns. We also had to experience the hardships of jungle warfare. We set off from Maiga, near Buen, more than ten days ago. Because there are several enemy planes bombing during the day, we cannot move. So, we only move at night. In the forest at night, we walked hand in hand, but we could not make out each other's faces. Fortunately, it rained heavily for two or three hours every day at night, so we could move in the instant of lightning. This is the only "road sign." Sometimes, we found the phone line of the allied forces in the lightning and walked along the line. The dried bread we brought when we set off was soaked by the rain, and we ate it like glutinous rice cakes. When we thought about the time we served in Guadalcanal, we ate ants' nests and tree roots. This time, we can eat bread, so we feel very happy.</p>
<p>Self-Sufficiency by Growing Vegetables Around the Position</p>
<p>After four or five days, we actually felt that we were approaching the front line. However, the closer we got to the front line, the faster we moved. When the forest caught fire and the enemy's artillery fire became more intense, the light of the flames and explosions could be used as our target, and we no longer had to rely on lightning. However, we did not know when we would encounter the enemy, and the enemy planes flew as high as the forest. They would fire their guns even if they saw only one person. We peeled off banana leaves and used them as camouflage to advance. Near the front line, there were allied positions, and around the positions, there were camouflaged vegetable gardens, planted with cabbage, radishes, etc. From our experience in the bloody battle of Guadalcanal, we need to implement self-sufficiency in the fierce battlefields. It is admirable to grow vegetables in the spare time of battle.</p>
<p>After seven days, the forest became a wetland. Although there were small rivers, all the bridges had been destroyed. The shallow wetlands reached the knees, and the deep ones reached the waist. Our speed of advance was as slow as in the dense forest area. What was even more difficult was taking pictures. We wanted to take pictures of the soldiers' hardships and send them to the rear. But the humidity was high in this place. It took four or five rolls of film to take a picture. The sun was scorching above the forest. How we longed for the sun! We needed the sun. It was our only hope. But if we saw the sun, we could not survive for a moment, because the enemy planes would not let us move.</p>
<p>Using Rifles to Assault Tanks</p>
<p>We, who carried pens and cameras from Buen to the front line of Torokina, still felt it was so difficult. As for the movement of the army, it can be imagined. When we came to the front line of Torokina, we heard the captain say this: "When the enemy landed on Cape Torokina, we mobilized the mountain artillery unit to aid. The mountain artillery departed after the infantry. After a day or two, the mountain artillery could not catch up. The infantry carried rifles and advanced, holding vines in both hands. The soldiers of the mountain artillery divided the mountain artillery into three parts: the barrel, the mount, and the carriage, and followed the infantry. Because it was impossible to act together with the infantry in this dense forest, they first abandoned the carriage, then the mount, and finally only the barrel. However, the barrel alone could not fire the artillery. As a result, this unit only used rifles to deal with the enemy tanks that were transported to the land. No matter how strong the Japanese army is, rifles cannot defeat tanks. Therefore, if we want to win, we must open routes in the front line, and then we must continue to transport the weapons and bullets made by the people's blood and sweat from the rear. This time will come soon. The soldiers on the front line are determined to fight resolutely, no matter what the sacrifice, so there is nothing to worry about. Please, the rear must be more consolidated. This is the call of the soldiers fighting on the front lines of the South Pacific." (Hiroshi, from the February 12th Yomiuri Hochi)</p>
<h3>A Pilgrimage to the Southern Italian Front</h3>
<p>The Southern Italian front has become increasingly tense since the anti-Axis forces landed in Anzio. Bloody battles are unfolding everywhere in the Apennine Mountains. The Yomiuri Shimbun special correspondent, who once served as a soldier in the freezing Apennine Mountains for ten days, presents the following observations:</p>
<p>Characteristics of the Southern Italian Front</p>
<p>The coastline in this area is undulating, the mountains are intricately intertwined, and the terrain is complex. Unlike the Eastern Front, large-scale combat cannot be carried out, and trench warfare is inevitable. It has the characteristics of both coastal defense warfare and mountain warfare. Therefore, the cooperation of paratrooper units and artillery units, the cooperation of mountain units and engineer units, and flexible coordination are necessary. Not only that, but the active role of specially organized units is also needed. The Schultz regiment, known as the "Mother of Paratrooper Divisions," and the Alpine units that were active on the Caucasus line. The reporter looked out from the highest point of the front, Mount Maiella, and saw that from north to south, there were many peaks and valleys. The southern Italian cities, which developed from the castles of medieval lords, stood on these mountaintops. Only a road through the valleys connected one city to another, so each city became a natural fortress.</p>
<p>The German army is numerically inferior to the British and American forces, but there is a significant difference in quality. Using the rugged terrain of the Apennine Mountains, various positions are adapted to the terrain, covered with rocks and vegetation, and houses are organically combined to form a fire line. On January 19th, the enemy fired as many as 600 shells at the German front-line base in the eastern area, which stretched for two kilometers, but could not advance a single step. The ingenuity of the German positions is evident. The same is true for coastal defenses. The reporter visited Schultz, the commander of the paratrooper regiment, and asked him everything. He replied as follows:</p>
<p>"At this moment, the German coastal defenses include mines, underwater obstacles, pillboxes, etc., which have a sustained defensive nature; and aircraft, submarines, and various artillery fires, which have a mobile attack nature. The operation on the Atlantic coast is very different because of the relationship between troops and mobility. In the former, the enemy must be deeply lured inland and annihilated; in the latter, a counterattack is launched near the coast. And the morale of our army is higher than expected. The Allied forces have not yet had a sense of impending danger."</p>
<p>Cities on the battlefield have been razed to the ground. Pescara, one of the most beautiful cities on the Adriatic coast, is no exception. Bombing has reduced the city of 45,000 people to ruins. The reporter entered the city and observed. The bright sunlight of the south shone, but there were no people in the streets. The birthplace of the Italian patriotic poet D'Annunzio, the house where he was born, which houses his books and works, has become a national treasure. His nephew and a maid lived there, and even this family could not escape the bombing. Among the scattered scraps of paper in his house, the reporter found a pair of letters signed by his mother, dated July 26, 1899, from Florence. The letter read: "I will be at the mouth of the Arno River for a few days. Mother." These words aroused infinite emotion in the reporter, but the loud sound of artillery fire came from everywhere, and suddenly brought the reporter back to reality.</p>
<p>In one war zone, the "Mussolini Legion" of the new Italian National Defense Army, which cooperated with the German army, showed an active posture. After the collapse of the old Italian National Defense Army, a new National Defense Army was created under Mussolini's new ideas and organization, and rushed to the front line to defend the country. Although there are Patrio rebels on the anti-Axis side, in fact, it is only a slight addition. The tragedy of the century has been staged with the division of compatriots and the killing of siblings. (Translated from the February 3rd Yomiuri Hochi)</p>
<h3>The Heart of the South Seas - The Truk Islands</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 17th of last month, the enemy repeatedly launched air raids on the Truk Islands with powerful mobile units. The Japanese army and navy units in that area retaliated.</p>
<p>Since the end of last month, when the enemy, the United States, launched an invasion of the Marshall Islands, a Japanese territory, it finally launched a powerful mobile unit to attack Truk Island, the central hub of the inner South Seas, in less than ten days. From the morning of the 17th to the morning of the 18th, hundreds of carrier-based aircraft formed a large formation and began a real major offensive. The Truk Islands are the most important stronghold on the Japanese southern operation line, and the enemy's frontal attack is expected to be extremely powerful. The front line has further approached the mainland. The morale of the Japanese army and navy garrison troops is becoming more and more激昂, they are inviting to resist and are taking on the important responsibility of defending the motherland's first line. The battle situation is about to enter a major opportunity.</p>
<p>The US Pacific Fleet Command issued a public statement on the night of the 17th, stating that the attack on Truk Island began on the morning of the 16th, and hundreds of US Air Force planes participated. Also, the Associated Press reported:</p>
<p>According to the Pacific Fleet Command, the operation may still be in progress. Due to the implementation of radio control during the largest naval attack operation, detailed reports cannot be obtained from the fleet. (Translated from the February 19th Western Mainichi Shinbun)</p>
<p>The word "Truk" means "deaf man's high mountain" in the local language. As the name suggests, it can be seen that the islands of the archipelago are 　shaped. Scattered among the 150-mile-circumference atoll are many islands such as Shiki Island and Mokuyo Island, of which the largest are the Archipelago and Yongyao Island, which are 30 kilometers in circumference. The island is mostly hilly, with miscellaneous trees growing, and produces dried bonito and high-class shells. The residents are the Kanaka people of the Micronesian system, about 10,000 fishermen, who grow taro and coconuts on land. Stepping on Truk, one feels that there is no South Seas flavor here. Everything is just like a Japanese fishing village. The islanders wear Japanese-made summer shirts and summer pants, and say "Good morning" in the morning and "Good night" in the evening, just like the Japanese. The same language, without any strangeness. On Xia Island and Mizume Island, there are four-year public schools, where the children of the islanders are educated, with no difference from the Japanese. In short, the Truk Islands, the heart of the inner South Seas, is also the heart of the entire South. The heroic Japanese army is working hard to repel the enemy in order to protect the lifeline of the South China Sea. (Abridged translation from the February 20th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Dreams of the Sea</h3>
<p>— Yingcai</p>
<p>I helped a wandering and helpless heart, drifting alone and lonely in Shanghai, for a full four years. In the bitter cup of life, even the dregs are painful. I endure the bitter cup of life, spending my remaining years, not daring to have even a second of fantasy, not daring to have even a moment of clarity. Fantasy and clarity will ruthlessly sting your heart, which is riddled with wounds! I know this myself, so I only allow myself to spend my days and nights in a drunken stupor, constantly drinking. Get drunk! Get drunk until my end. In the gently breezy late night, I staggered out of the small bar, on my way home! The crescent moon hung on the willow tips, the little stars like mysterious, spiritual eyes, weren't they reminding me of my past years? They clearly brought back familiar, memorable scenes. The scenes unfolded like a lunar eclipse in the darkness, devouring sweet memories, allowing a moment of comfort to my heart. Her long, wavy hair fell over her shoulders, two pupils as deep as the sea were set in her eye sockets, and then there were her pink cheeks. When she lowered her head, smiling shyly at people, what a charming posture. All of this further enveloped me. Ah! The song I used to teach her floated up again! Dreams of the Sea, is this a dream?</p>
<p>I calmed down and listened carefully again. Indeed, that slow singing was still lingering in my ears. Under the willow shade, stood a girl with her hands full of flowers. I seemed to have found something I had lost for many years, and I called out to her with a familiar voice, and walked closer to her with a floating body. But she ignored me, rolled her eyes, pursed her lips, and called me a drunkard! Ah, what an unpredictable woman's heart! She ran towards the end of the street without looking back, disappearing without a trace. The breeze still blew gently, dispersing my drunkenness. I regretted not chasing after the vanished girl. I stood dumbfounded on the street for a while, then raised my powerless feet and walked weakly into the small room, staring at the framed picture in front of my bed!</p>
<p>...Sixteen years ago in the autumn, she and I agreed to meet by a stream in a certain village. She stood by the stream, about to run away. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled. There was no time to escape. All around were trees. After turning a bend, I arrived at my residence. Looking back at her, her long hair was soaked with rain, and there wasn't a single dry spot on her body, so I invited her in with pity to take shelter at my place. She sat and talked without any hesitation. The rain fell harder and harder, and our conversation became more and more extensive. Her father was a reclusive poet, and her name was Danyan (Light Smoke). Ah! I met a girl as poetic as the scenery in a poetic place. Afterwards, in the early mornings when the wild grass was covered with dew, and until the evenings when the setting sun sank, she often stayed by the stream. She naturally gazed at the natural fields, her deep eyes measuring the deep sky. Sometimes she leaned against a tree, sometimes she rested against a large rock. The stream was her only companion. By the trees and the stream, she learned to sing with me, "The spring trees and evening clouds are how you and I gaze at each other, the setting moon and lingering clouds are how you and I long for each other! Dreams of the Sea, exclusively for you and me! The heart is so difficult, the life is so floating! Wanting to stay but unable to, wanting to leave but unable to, the storms of the bitter sea! Wandering... drifting..." This was the song she hummed every day afterwards. One dreary dusk, she sadly told me that her father had passed away and that she was being forced to marry her cousin, who was a wastrel. From then on, her lovely figure was no longer seen by the stream. I only faintly heard that she had a child, and there were frequent rumors that they were very happy together. I, this person drifting from east to west, wandered to another place, and her news was cut off from then on. I only silently hoped in a corner of the world that she would be happy forever... One morning I received a letter forwarded from her village! It read:</p>
<p>My respected sir!</p>
<p>Friend of the past by the stream, all</p>
<p>the misfortunes were not unexpected. Last</p>
<p>winter, I married my cousin. He was very good.</p>
<p>He immediately changed his former dissipated ways.</p>
<p>We had a daughter—Xiaoyan (Little Smoke), very happy,</p>
<p>but inherent nature is hard to change. After a long time,</p>
<p>Xiaoyan's father eventually didn't come home every night,</p>
<p>and spent all day gambling and whoring. Now,</p>
<p>he has fallen in love with a socialite,</p>
<p>and has gone to Shanghai for a honeymoon,</p>
<p>abandoning me heartlessly. This is not all,</p>
<p>he didn't even tell me in advance,</p>
<p>and sold the house I lived in.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the buyer pressed me to move</p>
<p>today that I found out.</p>
<p>My daughter and I have nowhere to go.</p>
<p>I originally wanted to ask sir for help,</p>
<p>but I really don't have the face.</p>
<p>If sir is willing to help me find a way to relieve my hardship,</p>
<p>please come to my old residence once within three days.</p>
<p>After three days, I will become a drifter for life,</p>
<p>and where the broken duckweed will grow</p>
<p>is also unknown.</p>
<p>Goodbye! Waiting for your arrival!</p>
<p>Sincerely, Danyan</p>
<p>Oh Heavens! This letter, after being transferred from east to west, had already passed two weeks. I still didn't give up and ran to that village, but there was no trace of her there. But today! I saw her! She! Was still so young, so innocent, but why did she ignore me! Ah! Drunkenness ruined things. Otherwise, I should have caught up with her! And asked for an explanation!</p>
<p>The next day, I waited for her again at the place where I had met her yesterday, but she never came. Day after day, hope gradually disappeared. In the vast world, had our reunion been cut off? So I drank that strong wine again, letting life become more drunk, more numb! More ignorant! I myself didn't know how I ended up drunk on the roadside. I woke up with a start, and suddenly my eyes lit up. Those sea-like pupils flickered beside me, and that low voice flew into my ears, "Sir! Are you awake? You really scared me to death!" I focused my mind and looked again. This young life, this innocent girl, who else could she be but her? I grabbed her tightly, the drunkenness dissipated, but her face seemed strangely unfamiliar! This was a young stranger. I curiously asked her, and learned that this was the flower-selling girl. She said she had no surname, and refused to tell me her name. I became her regular customer. One day she brought the flowers and wanted to go back very quickly. I didn't know what was wrong with her, so I deliberately made things difficult for her and asked her to change the water in the bottle. She obediently went to change it and then left. This happened every day afterwards. She had no time to answer my questions. One day she didn't come, and I waited until noon, but someone else came, someone I had never seen before. She told me herself that she was Xiaoyan's friend and that Xiaoyan's mother was very ill and couldn't leave, so she was substituting for her to deliver flowers. I frantically wanted her to take me to Xiaoyan's house. Today I learned that this flower-selling girl was Xiaoyan. I and this other girl rushed to a lane and entered a low little house. It was said that this was Xiaoyan's home, but she herself ran away with the flowers. This small house was so dark that I couldn't see the direction. After a long time, I saw a dark shadow wriggling in the eastern corner. I hurriedly called Xiaoyan. The girl told me that her mother was critically ill. That miserable voice reminded me of when Danyan was telling me about it in the late winter. Immediately, the girl pulled me into another small room. Under the greenish dim light of the bean oil lamp, I heard that the critically ill person, with her sea-like pupils, was familiar, but nothing else was. I was stunned. Xiaoyan said beside me, "Mom! This is the gentleman who buys my flowers every day!" The weak patient nodded slightly in thanks, suddenly supported herself to sit up, took my hand, and said laboriously, "Aren't you...aren't you...Mr. Ying...Ying? You, you...have forgotten me, haven't you!" I hurriedly stopped her and told her to lie down, but she was still saying, "I...I will forever, forever rest! Let me...let me entrust...entrust Xiaoyan to you! Please...please promise...promise me! This...this last...last request..." I silently held her dry hand, sadly nodding my head. Suddenly that dry hand loosened. Ah! Danyan! She! Rested forever... The greenish dim light of the bean oil lamp became even greener! Ah! Danyan! I searched for you for more than ten years, and today I finally found you! Reunited! But! Smoke, you really dissipated like smoke. My wandering and helpless heart will become even more lonely and desolate. The bitterness of the dregs in the bitter cup is even stronger. The bitter cup of life, the remaining years, how dare I think about it again. Suddenly, I frantically ran to the small bar nearby, sat down, and habitually used strong wine to bury myself in a drunken stupor. As I was raising that white liquid straight to my mouth, a panting voice, softly and urgently, said, "Sir! Help me with my future life!" Xiaoyan was leaning at my feet. I blankly paid for the wine, helped Xiaoyan, and drifted back to the dark lane. The low little house appeared before my eyes. The greenish dim oil lamp flickered, and suddenly went out. Everything was in darkness...</p>
<p>The crescent moon hung on the willow tips, the little stars had mysterious eyes, and Xiaoyan mournfully sang: "The spring trees and evening clouds are how you and I gaze at each other, the setting moon and lingering clouds are how you and I long for each other! Dreams of the Sea, exclusively for you and me!"</p>

<h3>Bitter Cup</h3>
<p>— Jiagan</p>
<p>I, cup by cup,</p>
<p>drain the bitter cup.</p>
<p>A blush flies onto my emaciated face,</p>
<p>but I never think of furrowing my brow.</p>
<p>The world is like strangely arranged bizarre stones,</p>
<p>breaking my steps;</p>
<p>fresh red blood flows out,</p>
<p>step by step leaving behind my past heavy memories.</p>
<p>Human relationships are like fire in a furnace,</p>
<p>beautiful, pretty, but fierce,</p>
<p>they can make you feel warm,</p>
<p>but,</p>
<p>when it abruptly says goodbye to you,</p>
<p>light and heat both scatter in the wind.</p>
<p>Will you then quietly sob to yourself</p>
<p>for the quietly arriving cold loneliness?</p>
<p>The white hairs on father's head,</p>
<p>star by star,</p>
<p>are more numerous day by day,</p>
<p>appearing even older than before;</p>
<p>mother's back is bent even more severely,</p>
<p>and those pair of rough hands—</p>
<p>this haggard image</p>
<p>will give me iron-like spurring,</p>
<p>and a fountain of tears!</p>
<p>I will be on the platform,</p>
<p>hoarsely shouting,</p>
<p>they quietly listen, listening.</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>who can hear my inner secrets?</p>
<p>Who can understand the music of my heart's vibrating strings?</p>
<p>I only wish—</p>
<p>to let them be buried in the depths of my heart,</p>
<p>forever becoming my unmentionable secret! I, cup by cup,</p>
<p>drain the bitter cup;</p>
<p>my cheeks are stained with evening dew,</p>
<p>but I never think of furrowing my brow.</p>

<p>Spring grass sprouts and grows day by day, the Eight Lives career is like the morning sun, the broad road is diligently attained, and you should strengthen yourself at the top of the hundred-foot pole.

<h3>Five Women's Teams Participate in the Open Basketball Tournament, Dahua Will Be Green Team's Strongest Opponent, Overseas Chinese and Three Provinces Teams Have Similar Strengths</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament kicked off on the 5th of this month at the YMCA gymnasium in Baixianqiao. All the heroic teams are showing their skills, and the stadium is packed with fans, creating an unprecedented scene. In particular, the Dahua-Kang'ai match in the women's division was one of the most highly anticipated scenes for the audience. The women's basketball team of Green has been silent for a long time, so this grand occasion is very meaningful. For the sake of encouragement and promotion, the author specially reviews the simple situation of the competition, and introduces the strength of the San Sheng Overseas Chinese team (a total of five teams participated, and the Dahua Kang'ai team have already been introduced in this publication). First, let's review the Dahua-Kang'ai battle:</p>
<p>Review of the Dahua vs. Kang'ai Battle</p>
<p>Under the planning of Chairman Yang Shuding, everything in the Dahua team is proceeding on track. On this day, they were all in new uniforms, bright and dazzling, and full of energy. Kang'ai is guided by Li Mingyang and organized by students from the St. John's Sports Class. Although they belong to this field, the training period is still short, so they are slightly inferior.</p>
<p>In this competition, Dahua relied on its well-trained triangular passing, constantly attacking. Forwards Huang Meijuan and Huang Fengzhen were exceptionally active. Although Kang'ai tried their best to resist, they eventually lost ground due to their insufficient strength, and their scores plummeted. In the end, Dahua, out of sisterly affection, felt that they should not push each other too hard, so they frequently substituted players. On the one hand, they didn't seek too much, and on the other hand, the newcomers could also gain more competition experience. From then on, Dahua's score gradually decreased, but Kang'ai still couldn't easily get started. Because the difference in ability was still far away, the result was that Dahua scored thirty-eight points and Kang'ai only scored three points, which was also very miserable!</p>
<p>Watching Dahua's tactics, it is indeed a well-trained team. Its offense mostly uses triangular passing and pick-and-roll offense, which is quite methodical. Its defense uses man-to-man marking, which is very tight. It is difficult for the enemy to find gaps, so if Dahua can intensify its efforts and continue its efforts, then this year's championship can compete with the once dominating Green team. Among the individual skills, forward Huang Meijuan is the best. Not only is her shooting accurate, but her posture is also beautiful and graceful. Her speed of shooting is beyond the reach of other female players. Huang Fengzhen runs in a very good position and shoots with confidence. Shen Shuwei has sufficient strength, but her skills do not seem to be fully refined. Guards Xue Deyin and Xue Nenyin are a pair of sister flowers, firmly guarding the rear, like a copper wall and iron wall, intercepting the ball under the basket, and have unique skills. Cheng Mulan has plenty of running ability and is also a good general for defense. The rest, such as Huang Meiyu, Liu Zhaolan, Deng Qiyao, and Zhou Zhifen, are all rising stars. They are truly a multitude of talents. Kang'ai is known as the best in the team for Wang Yinde's bravery, and guard Wang Danyu should be a top general with both wisdom and courage. It is a pity that good flowers have no green leaves to support them, only seeing her hard work in vain, but I dare to say that Miss Wang's position in the basketball world will surely achieve something.</p>
<p>Now, let's introduce the three women's teams of the Green team, Overseas Chinese, and San Sheng, so that fans can get a glimpse of the strength of each team in the women's division.</p>
<p>San Sheng - affiliated with the San Sheng Sports Association, its history is not long, but many of its members are from sports schools, so they can make progress day by day. Since its establishment, there have been at least two practices every week. When they perform, they should be treated with a new perspective. It is no longer the scattered sand of the early days of its establishment. Team member Shi Ruijuan is a famous volleyball player. Since taking over as captain of the San Sheng women's basketball team, she has been wholeheartedly focusing on this, making rapid progress. Her one-handed basket shot under the basket is very reliable, and she has excellent elasticity. She can also command the whole team's soul. Forward Wang Fuzhi was a representative of Shandong City, which shows her exquisite ball skills, and her rapid shooting has a masculine style. It is similar to the style of the Green team's Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shujian, and the retired Xiao Dong. Chen Huidi is a top student of Southeast Teacher's College and is naturally an expert in the field. She is most outstanding at dribbling and has a good relationship with Captain Shi. Therefore, the forward of this team is quite tough. Guards Lu Cuifang and Zhao Jichen have strong bodies and have the advantage of grabbing and blocking the ball. Chen Zezhuang has a different bow for blocking and dribbling, but can show his skills in danger. Captain Shi praised him as a standard guard, which is not false. The rest, such as Hu Meixian and Chen Meizhen, are all first-class players in the volleyball world. They are rarely seen in the basketball arena. In theory, their performances can often be as sharp as in volleyball. Observing the strength of this team, it is slightly weaker than Dahua Green team. Although they will definitely make a difference, they can be expected to defeat Overseas Chinese in the league and win the third place.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese - is a new organization under the banner of the Overseas Chinese Sports Association. Chairman Huang Shengchang is passionate about promoting it, and specially invited basketball star Zhuo Guorong as the coach. The members of this team usually practice with the men's team, so their endurance is quite amazing. Although they cannot stand out in the league, they will definitely achieve considerable results. The reporter watched the team members fight and felt that the whole team was made up of rising stars. Given time, they will surely become a strong team. Encourage them, their captain Xie Lijian, judging from the name, it can be known that she is a strong person, and her ball skills are quite superior. The other two forwards are Zhang Qifeng and Hu Xiubo, who are extremely good at shooting. On the guard side, there is Wu Ailian in charge. Miss Wu has a slender figure, and jumping up to catch the ball has a multiplier effect. Huang Yuzhen's passing is also quite good. Lin Xiangzhi can rush forward to grab the ball, and success lies in the guard's rush. Su Lanzhen is a sports star among female workers and has the best understanding of badminton. She has been getting the ball for a short time, but her talent will not disappoint. The whole team is quite motivated and can strive for the third place in the league.</p>
<p>Green Team - the members are all famous players in the basketball world, with a long-standing reputation in the women's basketball world. This year, they have risen again, and have extended the invitation to Qian Xucang as the guide and Xie Yiqin as the manager. Like a fish in water, their reputation is even more outstanding. In terms of its lineup, there is Rong Shujian as the forward, a veteran in the sports world, short and capable. Her left-handed shooting style is similar to that of Shen Yugong, which is difficult to defend. Yan Weiwen is a former Qixiu strong general, with extremely sufficient energy. Her passing and shooting are very skilled. Coupled with her kind attitude, she is a model among athletes. Huang Mingyuan is the captain, agile and has the style of a general. She can shoot from a long distance and is a rare talent. Li Lizhi is experienced. The guard Liu Zhengbao is the first place in Shanghai's shooting competition, which shows her level. However, this year she will retire. First, the team has many forward talents. Second, Zhenbao's sneaking out to grab the ball is wonderful to the slightest detail, and she will definitely have an excellent performance. She is a versatile talent. Wang Weizhen was a team pillar of the Patriotic team, and her tight guarding of people often makes them collapse. Her bravery when fighting never allows anyone to get ahead of her, but she is quite polite after the game. Zhu Yilan, Zhu Chengjan, and Zhang Zhiru are all top-notch talents in guarding. Wang is good at intercepting the ball, Zhu Yilan is good at taking the lead, and Zhang is brave and good at fighting. This year, they will be able to exert their strength and maintain the past glory. The only concern is Dahua.</p>
<p>In short, the participation of the above-mentioned five women's teams in this league will naturally add a lot of grand occasions. In the long-silent women's sports, this should be regarded as a baptism of promotion. As for peeking at the strength and predicting the championship, it must be the contention between Dahua and the Green team. Overseas Chinese and San Sheng have similar strengths and often have development. Kang'ai's technology is relatively poor and may be inferior to others. However, with their good physique, after a considerable period of time, they may have unexpected achievements. Then, every Sunday (there must be one game) the competition will be fierce, so I do not hesitate to introduce it in detail above, I think it will be a pleasure for the fans to read it? (Meijie)</p>
<h3>Watching Last Week's Football Match</h3>
<p>Last week's football match had two scenes in the second round of the league. The two giants of the Chinese team, Donghua and Lianyi, both sent troops. As a result, although Donghua had a strong army, it only narrowly defeated the rookie team, San Sheng, by one goal. Lianyi once won Qiaolian by three to two, but finally lost three goals in a row and was defeated miserably. There is a reason for this. The reporter does not avoid his own opinions and writes them below.</p>
<p>Donghua first showed laxity, then anxiety and panic</p>
<p>Donghua met San Sheng at Jiaoyuan last Saturday afternoon. Before the game, everyone thought that the game would be one-sided. Because Donghua is a winning team, while San Sheng has been defeated repeatedly. In fact, the difference between the champion and the runner-up, and the judgment of victory or defeat, is self-evident. However, the result was the opposite. Donghua only won by one goal narrowly. The reason is that Donghua had a confident and underestimating mind before the war, which arose spontaneously, and the battle inevitably became lax. For example, Han Nenghai did not use his full strength to scurry, and Li Yao was even more weak, not as hard as when he encountered a strong enemy, which led to the front line seeing wasted efforts. On the contrary, under the guidance of Father Wang, San Sheng used new tactics to win by surprise, with Mairson tightly marking Han Longhai, and Xu Guofu keeping a close eye on Sun Jinshun. Because they knew that their skills were not as good as others, and the players were young and had plenty of endurance, they blocked their way, which was indeed insightful. Because of this, Donghua gained nothing in the first half. In the second half, Donghua had to call up Dai Linjing to help out because Sun Jinshun was injured and left the field. The whole team began to use its full strength, but in view of the danger in the first half, there was a phenomenon of anxiety due to the eagerness to win the ball. In the end, they only won by two to one. If Donghua had not been lax in the first half and did not need to have a phenomenon of panic in the second half, they should have scored more goals. However, San Sheng's undaunted battle against a powerful enemy is commendable. Furthermore, Donghua already has an 80% grasp of the league championship. It is hoped that they will not be proud or discouraged and can maintain their winning prestige and create a more remarkable history, which would be great.</p>
<p>Lianyi lost after winning, due to lack of composure</p>
<p>The battle between Lianyi and Qiaolian took place at Yiyuan last Sunday morning. The audience was extremely crowded. Both teams were strong teams, especially Qiaolian, which used all-Italian generals, so its appeal was very great. From the point of view of this war performance, the battle situation was always in the process of both offense and defense being excellent. Song Lingsheng of Lianyi and Bao Jie of Qiaolian were the souls of the two teams' offense and defense. The battle was colorful, and the audience praised it. When Lianyi was leading by three to two in the second half, if they could focus on defense and use offense as a supplement, they might be able to maintain the victory. However, the team was focused on offense, which caused Qiaolian to tie the game. Afterwards, a few strong players suddenly changed psychologically, which led to foul actions. Wu Qixiang was even injured and left the field. All of this was caused by the inability to calm down, while Qiaolian took the opportunity to launch a major attack and took two more cities. Lianyi lost by three to five.</p>
<p>Many outsiders were meddling, almost causing a full-scale fight</p>
<p>The most regrettable thing about the Lianqiao battle was that there were also people outside the stadium who echoed the chaos, which led to a major conflict with the players. In the end, they threatened with force, which was very undesirable. Therefore, there were several incidents, fortunately, the organizers tried their best to resolve them, and then they were calmed down. I still remember the Jiaoyuan Yiyi incident two years ago, which is still fresh in my mind. Today, this incident is repeated, and I cannot help but feel emotional. The reporter deeply hopes that the players will know how to encourage themselves, and correct any bad actions if they have them, and strive to do better if they don't. It is even more hoped that the spectators outside the stadium will not make unnecessary noises, because everything in the game is the responsibility of the referees and the authorities.

<h3>Simple Exercise Methods for Physical Fitness (10)(4)</h3>
<p>— Written by Tom, translated by I.</p>
<p>Stand straight. Slightly bend both knees, lift heels off the ground, and quickly squat down, with the center of gravity of the whole body on the balls of the feet. The upper body should be straight, even when in a seated position. Quickly stand up. Once able to maintain body balance in the seated position, jump several times without standing up.</p>
<p>There is no better method for stretching and developing the muscles of the thighs.</p>
<p>Thigh muscles squat, stand up (five times each initially).</p>
<p>Note: Special exercises should not be less than twenty-five times.</p>
<p>Exercise 1</p>
<p>There are four special exercises for developing shoulder and chest muscles. Three of them can be done with or without equipment.</p>
<p>Stand straight, arms hanging down. Clench both fists tightly, as if holding a dumbbell, turn the arms to the right, palms facing outward, backs of hands touching the thighs. Extend both arms outward and upward, until both hands pass each other above the head, lifting as high as possible. Return both hands to the sides of the body, keeping the arms straight.</p>
<p>Imagine lifting a heavy dumbbell, so the movement should be slow and powerful. When lowering, act as if it is very heavy and requires effort to resist.</p>
<p>Shoulders and chest arms hanging by the sides: turn outward, up, down (ten times each).</p>
<p>Note: Special exercises should not be less than twenty-five times.</p>
<p>Exercise 2</p>
<p>Stand straight, arms hanging down. Raise both arms to the sides, keeping the arms straight, until the hands, arms, and shoulders are roughly level. Both hands should be as if holding dumbbells, and holding them vertically (like a circle). Bring both hands forward, keeping the arms straight, until both fists touch, then slowly return to the original position, bending backward as much as possible, keeping the hands level with the shoulders. The body should sway from the ankle joints, but the waist should not bend. Obviously, do not make a forward movement, that is, protrude beyond the front of the body.</p>
<p>Shoulders and chest arms hanging by the sides: forward: backward, each (ten times)</p>
<p>Note: Special exercises should not be less than twenty times.</p>
