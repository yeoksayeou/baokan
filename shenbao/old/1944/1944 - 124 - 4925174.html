<h3>星期評論吉田東佑言論集　第二集序</h3>
<p>— 吉田東佑</p>
<p>拙著言論集第二集，與「日本的反省與中國的革新」的日文版，同時出版了。本書裹也收集着日文版言論集的序，讀者只要一閱，就可以明瞭我發行該書的意向，所以本書就無需專門的序言。然而在此，我對於中國讀者，有進一言的必要。我相信，在現階段上最能理解我言論的讀者，並不是我最希望讀這本書的日本人，而是中國人。我認為日本讀者，尤其是速離中國而不懂現地實情的日本本國讀者，尚未能充分瞭解我的言論。我堅決相信，不久的將來，日本讀者一定也和中國讀者一樣，會理解我的意向，然而目前，痛詆我的言論為邪說異端的人們，仍如過江之響。且我認為，或許因這本著作，而將受到我所敬愛的祖國人民之擯棄。縱令在那種不幸的情形下，我仍然始終相信自己的中國觀點，是日本應走的正確方向。同時我還相信，那種情形下的中國讀者，更會支持我的正確言論。這因為關於中國問題的文章，中國讀者是最够資格的評判員。</p>
<p>然而一部份讀者，或許因這本言論集的作者是日本人，而就不大舒服。於是便下一結論，凡是日本人的言論，縱令乍見是正確的，而骨子曩定別有所圖。我很明瞭此種讀者的心情，我對於他們是想回答的。無論站在甚麼立塲說，我總歸是日本人，旣是日本人，就愛日本，就希望日本發展。所以為了日本的發展，假如中犧牲國是必要的，那末或許為了這種目的，而就藉文化工作來欺騙或麻醉中國人。現在退一萬步說，姑且假定我是這樣人，姑且假定為了這樣目的而發表言論集。</p>
<p>試看日本一個故事。某一壞人想欺騙慈悲的藩主，而使藩主藵獎自己，於是這位平常並不孝順的他，在藩王的眼光所能達到的地方，背負着隆鐘老母，無微不至地佯作孝子。藩主看見，便非常欽佩他的孝道，立刻賜與一封賞金。然而後來，明白了他是著名的惡棍，是為了欺騙藩主而得賞，才假裝孝順老母的。藩主的家人，非常憤慨，而想捉住這個惡徒，處以刑罰。但藩主不許，說：我老早就知道這個傢伙是一個壞蛋，然而縱令是一個壞蛋，如裝出孝子的樣子來，就可獲得獎賞，如瞭解這一點，一般人就會倣傚這個壞蛋，而假作孝道；假如全體社會都假裝孝道，那末對於壞人社會，是有造成良風美俗的希望的。</p>
<p>正如該藩主所正確指出，不管行為者的動機如何，而行為旣經表現於外部，則行為本身就與行為者的動機脫難，而是具有獨自客觀性的。例如不善於畫圖的人，主觀上想盡虎時，大筆一揮，所畫的並不像虎，而像貓，那末客觀上這就是一幅貓圖。現在縱或我主觀上定為了欺騙和麻醉中國人而寫文章，然而文章本身，假如在客觀上是眞理，那末當然也有其文化上的價值。我在此願意鄭重指出者，就是文化作品本身與作者的人格，並非一件東西，而是具有獨自客觀性的。我希望讀者，要客觀地批判這一言論集中所收羅的文章，正確者就說正確，錯誤者就說錯誤。至於說同一作品，如日本所寫者就，錯誤，中國人所寫者就正確，這種民族主羲態度，早已是時代的落伍者了。日木人和巾國人，本來全都是感情易受衝動的國民，強烈的感情，如由好的理性引導的話，就可以作好事，然而如受外部壞人所利用時，就能作出大錯而特錯的事來。兩大民族的感情，當激烈的時候，如使冷靜下來，固然困難，然而目前的時代，却在非常迫切地要求，兩大民族平心靜氣地聽取理性。總之，這木言論集，不應當看作者是日木人，抑是霍屯督（Hottentots）人而加論斷，凡客觀上正碗的言論，就應當頌揚為正確，也不能按作者是中國人，抑是挨期基摩（Esldmo）人，而加論斷，凡錯誤者，就應常痛詆為錯誤。何况現在這一時代，我堅信日木的發展，如中國不發展，則為不可能，同時，眞正的亞洲解放，如中日兩大民族不眞正團結起來，則是不可能的。我盼望中國讀者，不要根據我是日本人來批評我的文章，而要用理性，就文章論文章。假如我有錯誤，就請以同志的態度來糾正我，這就是我對於中國讀者的懇切請求。（魯譯）</p>
<h3>日古賀元帥殉國　我朝野同伸哀悼　任海長林部長等發表感想</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　盟邦大本營昨發表，聯合艦隊司令長官古賀峯一大將，已於本年三月在前錢乘機指揮作戰時，壯烈殉職，遣缺已任命豐田副武大將繼任。自是項消息披露後，此間朝野各界，靡不表示深切之悼惜。蓋古賀大將自客歲四月，繼任聯合艦隊司令長官以來，不避艱難，立於陣頭指揮若定，建樹赫赫殊勳，發揮日海軍之傳統精神，予敵以極大挫折。其不畏犧牲，忠勇報國之赤忱，與夫為東亞解放戰爭之奮鬥精神，胥使東亞十億民族，於哀悼之餘　益堅擊滅宿敵，完遂戰爭之意志也。</p>
<p>中央社訊　明邦日本古賀聯合艦隊司令長實，於前綫指揮作戰，不宰壯烈殉國。記者昨特走訪任海長，及中央海軍學校姜校長，當承發表感想如下：</p>
<p>任海長</p>
<p>古賀大將對吾國海軍　建設頗多協助，與本人公誼私交均極深厚。此次繼山本元帥之後，以身殉國·兩國人士同伸哀悼。但「戰死」為軍人無上之光榮，由於古賀大將之壯列犧牲，將使兩國國民益增敵愾同仇之心，而更形振奮。如是則古賀大將之英靈可慰，而戰爭勝利要亦可由此表現，蓋軍隊之作戰全賴士氣激昂也。觀諸山本元帥殉國後，盟邦海軍之屢戰屢勝，則擊滅英美，自可指日而待。</p>
<p>姜校長</p>
<p>古賀司令長官閣下，在上海任內時，余得親近之機會甚多，對其祟高之人格，敬佩已久。嗣當榮轉聯合艦隊司令長官時，余覺其過人之心勇，實堪為得人賀。近頃驚聞戰死之訊，余深感過去之仰慕為不虛。就大東亞戰爭而論，吾人謹致其至誠之感謝，惟以曩日仰慕之情，衷心實不勝痛切之至。自余置身新海軍與盟邦海軍將士合作以來，對其學養鍛鍊方面，至為欽佩，而其將官修養之精嚴忠純，尤為吾人所莫能望其項背。古賀大將凜烈不死之精神，不第為吾新海軍精神之舞模，幷為大東亞戰爭勝利之保證云。</p>
<p>林部長</p>
<p>南京六日中央社電　盟邦海軍聯合艦隊司令長官古賀元帥此次殉職，我國朝野同聲悲悼。宣傳部林部長，昨特發表談話如次：盟邦海軍聯合艦隊司令長官古賀元帥，此次不避艱險，親臨前綫指揮作戰，因而殉職，國民政府同人，於悲悼之餘，更深佩盟邦海軍傳統精神之偉大。盟邦海軍持此精神，全軍將士志切報國，勇於于犧牲，忠於職守，故自戰事發生以來，戰無不勝，攻無不克。當戰局日趨激烈之時，更能嚴陣待敵，使敵方任何反攻之陰謀，無所施其技，此種精神，實為大東亞戰爭海戰決勝最大之把握，亦爲東亞萬利長城最堅實之基石。豐田大將繼任司令長官，盟邦海軍同具決心，繼承山本古賀兩元帥之精神，賡續奮鬥。以報團家，以保東亞。山本·古賀。兩元帥雖不獲目覩最後戰果，然大東亞決戰之光榮的勝利，必有以慰兩元帥在天之靈，可以預下</p>
<p>日皇賜稱元帥</p>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日情報局五日發表稱：日皇陛下以聯合艦隊司令長官海軍大將古賀峯一之攻動，至堪嘉尙，特賜以元帥稱號，列名元帥府，叙一等攻，授與　動章，旭日桐花大綬章，敘爲正三位。</p>
<h3>豫平漢路西　日軍迭獲勝利　佔領頰縣禹縣臨汝</h3>

<p>東京五日中央社電　河南前綫六日訊，日軍己於三日將渝第廿二師死守之郊縣（許昌西方七十公里）完全佔領。</p>
<h3>渝美企圖悉遭際破</h3>
<p>漢口六日中央社電　子蔣鼎文麾下擁有四十師兵力，達四十萬衆之敵第一戰區軍，自三十年之中原大會戰以來，已喪失華北唯一據點，同時戰力低下，三年來唯有隱伏于黃河南岸京漢沿綫伏牛山系一帶。待至敵美軍對日反攻開始後，該軍復奉「抗戰勝利」之重慶命令，企岡對日總反攻，以期奪還華北·並開始準備，於去年五月一日，第一戰區司令蔣鼎文已開始擬定辦法。第一係加強軍師辦法，實行建軍，及充實裝備，編成機械化部隊。第二於戰區內修築格納庫，以備對日空製，或轟炸滿洲之用。第三為改進此等戰力之增強，置重點於戰意之昂揚，並動員全戰區之民力。敵戰區防衛中心，係以氾水為主之黃河西方山岳地帶，及京漢沿綫之河南大平原。主要戰地為汜水及登封臨汝，於伏牛山脈間之戰綫，全長達二百公里，寬達數十公里，以戰軍重砲等為多。更於新黃河一帶掘有散岳壕，掩蓋壕各陣地，以阻日軍戰車之進擎。尤其於重慶將領中，以最得蔣介石信任之湯恩伯，調任爲副官，掌握該方面戰區防衛之實權。所屬兵力計四集國軍，逹二十五萬，努力於培養戰力，並於去秋變更各軍之配置，以期增強黃河之防衛力。同時蔣鼎文於一月二十日，於洛陽召開軍事會，協議對華北總反攻計劃。一方面美國在重慶之將校，云洛陽葉城等各地戰區視察軍事狀况，美國在重慶空軍更於河南之南陽葉城等十餘處，擴張及整備空軍基地，俾重矗炸機能自由起落，於空陸兩方面對日總反攻，莫不積極準備中。不料此次河南作戰，竟遭日軍先發制人之攻擊，於各地相繼展開殲滅作戰，重慶軍不但反攻未成，結果竟遭此重創。</p>
<h3>日機炸廣西</h3>

<h3>印戰線雨季臨　日空軍龍敵機塲　大輸型陣地敵軍心以動搖</h3>
<p>仰光六日中央社電　敵空軍挺身部隊，經日軍空陸攻擊，結果已陷於被封鎖狀態，現美空軍似又開始蠢動，日空軍有鑒及此，於四日以急降下航空隊奇襲敵力納密喚養機塲。該機塲停有陶格拉斯三號飛機六架，大型滑翔機十一架，由遠處飛來，而敵航空將兵亦正行走於機塲中，儼然不知日空軍之來襲，日空軍由雲霧中飛抵該機塲上空後，立由隊長率領實施越低空轟炸，投下巨彈多枚，當將陶格拉斯機六架及滑翔機十一架完全炸毀，敵將兵百餘名倉皇不及躱避，亦全做炸斃，日機全數歸還。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　印緬前錢日軍某基地訊，日印同盟軍迫近伊姆法爾之消息傳至阿薩密地方後，該地居民莫不極感衝動，伊姆法爾居民集結於市內各地，尤其馬尼普爾人及印度人等，乘英人彈壓不及之際，密集於伊姆法爾市郊外，協議日印軍開抵後之方策。</p>

<h3>甘地翁氣衰弱　昨恢復自由　親信多人亦同日開釋</h3>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據新德里消息，印度政府今日宣佈釋放甘地翁。據公報稱，此次無條件釋放，係完全基於甘地翁之健康設想。甘氏獲釋後，即由監獄總監巴恩達里上校送至巴爾納古地方加好爾賽夫人家中，夫人爲甘氏之老友，一九三四年五月甘氏曾在夫人家中絕食十日。</p>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　據浦那電傳，甘地於六日出阿卡汗宮殿後，經兩主治醫師署名發表其症狀如次；甘地於四月十日以來，身體即不佳，迨十四日症狀轉惡，十六日以來體溫增高，呈瘧疾症態，血壓低下，渠雖衰弱已甚，精神依然爽朗，友人知己均望渠能充分調養。</p>

<h3>英國政策狡譎毒辣</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　此間深悉印度情勢者頃批評英國釋放甘地翁之狡猾政策如次：暴英之官憲，六日業將地翁釋放就，關於釋放甘地翁理由有二：　日本之印度進攻作戰成功以來，境內之民心頓時動搖，英國不得不與印人妥協，此乃由彈壓政策轉爲表面民主主義政治，亦象徵其欺滿民衆之作風，今昔實無異。　甘地翁近因瘧疾發作，瀕於死境，英國恐甘翁病死獄中，爲迴避其責任，乃行釋放者也。由印督府之發表，可知第一種理由頗足信任，自甘地翁及尼赫魯等呻吟於獄中之消息傳出後印度民衆一致要求釋放會議派之巨頭，然印督府始終拒絕，今特將甘翁地釋放，實因甘翁釋放，實因甘翁病入膏盲所致也。老獪之英國見甘地將死，爲迴避目身責任，同時又以此舉而懐柔印度民衆，其毒辣狡猾已達極點，英國何故只釋放甘地，而不將同一呻吟於獄中之尼赫魯等釋放，由此點觀之，英國之企圖，究在何處至爲明顯。</p>
<h3>拉巴爾附近敵機艇自鬥</h3>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　據新金山來電，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部，四日發表戰况公報稱：拉巴爾附近美戰鬥機與快速艇因演「不幸之戰鬥」，致喪失戰二機二架，死傷人員多名。又據新幾內亞基地之特拉斯之廣播亦報稱：三十日美戰鬥機將其友軍之快速艇誤認爲類似日本舟艇，乃加以攻擊，使其觸礁，快速艇亦將戰鬥機擊落一架，前來解救觸礁之艇及其他快速艇，亦受戰鬥機之攻擊，但該機不久復被擊落一架，二架均受重創。</p>
<h3>各國駐日武　參觀鹵獲兵器</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　中·德·義·羅·法·一滿·菲等駐日軸心武官，組成參觀團，於五日下午二時赴多摩川圖展覽會塲參觀。因皆爲軍事尃家，故於觀察敵軍兵器之際，均極熱心，一行對於昭南所鹵獲之戰利品極爲注目，是時參謀本部朝久野中佐及陸軍報道部澤田中佐，並詳細解說一切。參觀一小時後並舉行懇談會，羅馬尼亞拉多列斯少將曾表謝意調：自賭表徵日軍勝利之許多鹵獲兵器，惟有感激並祝日軍武運長久。</p>
<h3>朝鮮米糓雜糧　正積極增產　靑年是訓練成績良好</h3>

<h3>英美對西班牙　取消運油禁令</h3>
<p>畢爾巴鄂六日中央社電　海通社訊：西班牙油船「索台羅「號，咋由此間開往阿盧巴運油一萬噸返西班牙。另在馬拉加·塞維爾·巴塞羅納皮瓦移西亞之油船五艘，不久亦將開往中美運油三萬八千噸，因此西英美間新近所成立之條約規定每月供油四萬入千噸，五月份供給量即可安全抵西。</p>
<h3>歐洲大陸　空襲無虛日　襲羅賣美機落多架</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，軍息：美轟炸機大編隊日昨午後襲羅京，至少被擊落五十二架。德羅兩國空軍於敵機尙未飛抵羅境前，即在多瑙河上空擊落敵機十餘架，羅京以集中之高射砲火迎擊敵機，敵四引擎機數架於空中被命中後炸毀，衆料敵機除上述五十二架外，尙有多架因負創而不能飛返根據地。</p>
<h3>羅馬市區再度被炸</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　海通社訊：昨日美轟炸擊羣猛炸羅馬城東部人烟稠密之區，此爲愛爾蘭總理凡勒拉請求交戰國保全羅馬及德國保證羅馬不設防城市後之初次大規模轟炸。最近二十四小時內，歐洲空戰無重大之發展，反軸心空軍繼續致力轟炸西歐德軍佔領區內及德西部之交通綫。昨夜敵機數架以法國爲主要目標，曾至科隆及曼海姆區投彈，美機被擊落十一架。</p>
<h3>土耳其舉行　防空演習</h3>
<p>斯丹埠六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：此間於五日晚發出試騐空襲警報，民衆保持鎭靜如恒。按此間於一九四〇年後絕未曾舉行燈火管制或空襲演習。</p>
<h3>英美將舉行　侵歐祈禱日</h3>
<p>瑞典京城六日中央社電　海通社訊：今日倫敦消息，英敎會當局擬於侵歐開始時，舉行全國祈禱一日，美國亦有同樣建議，紐約州州長杜威已下令紐約州各敎堂須於侵歐開始之日舉行祈禱。</p>
<h3>東綫戰訊</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　海通社軍事訪員賽托　斯，評述歐戰現况稱，英美軍進攻西歐之可能性日見顯著。東綫蘇軍於本週二在雅賽西北舉行之進攻，可認爲預料之大攻勢前一大戰役，此次蘇軍大舉進攻之前，祗有局部戰事，雙方咸趨於大戰展開前改善其攻守之陣地。</p>

<p>— 樊仲雲</p>
<p>敎員不及車夫</p>
<p>在這年頭，對於敎育文化的事情，一般人是認爲無足重輕，加以蔑視的。因爲在戰爭時期是「勝利第一」——於第二，當然不是「失敗」，可也決不是敎育。因此之故，敎育文化事業的經費，在國家預算中是比例最少的，從事敎育文化的人們，他們的報酬是比任何事業都爲微薄，他們今日是名副其實的呌（敎）化人。或者也許以爲我未免言之過甚，那末請看一般社會認爲最低等的人力車去的報酬，就遠過於今日堂堂國立學校的大學敎授，至於中小學敎員，那更不必說起了。於是有人以爲上海俗語的所謂「痛三」，其文字應當是「華衫」，即執筆而衣長衫之人，或者「筆三」二字。因爲執筆的長衫人物很多，不一定爲學校敎員，但是敎員的筆却比他人爲多，他在平時用　筆，改卷用硃筆，上課用粉筆，他一身而兼用三筆，故其淪落而爲「筆三」，這當中是大有理由的。</p>
<p>因此之故，敎員是今日一般社會最看不起的人類，簡直等於賤民，一般的見解，好像敎員便是最沒出息的人幹的勾當。從前雖曾有過「萬般皆下品，惟有讀書高」的話，可蛋一羣眼而成爲百萬富翁。他們有錢，錢就代表了一切。根據英美拜金主義的見解，大洋錢的意義，就是所謂「成功」，英文Sucess一字，從頭到尾都是　（大洋綫）。所以富有大洋錢的商人，他們是今日的或功人物，反之，像渝落而爲「筆三」「呌化人」的敎員們，那不消說是生存競爭的失敗者，其爲人所盛棄是應當的。</p>
<p>但是話得說回來，大中小學校的敎員們雖爲一股人所輕視，可是大家對於大中小學校的學生却長非常重視的。他們知道靑年學生是最有用的最可寶貴的。所以一般力求上進的政治家不惜把辛苦得來的金錢，用來津貼學生，收買學生。他們需要能够捧塲的羣衆，學生便是數量最多的。他們需要能够盲從的徒黨，學生便是最有利用價值的。於是歡迎與接送，需耍學生，開會與講演也需要學生。在游行慶祝的時候，行列最整齊的是學生，又如毀烟館，打賭塲，那末最能幹的打手，更非學生莫屬。不過現今這裏是和平區域，所以像事變以前那一套　慨激昂的救國把戲，已不再需要了。</p>
<p>讀者的商業化</p>
<p>原來學生的意義，由字面來說，是學得人生的一切。人生一世最爲重耍的，無疑的是如何生活與求得富裕的生活。而在今日，讀書的結果是愈讀愈一無辦法。試看得了金元國家博士頭銜的大學敎授，現在不是連一日三餐都感到困難嗎？在學校中用功最動成績最好的學生，畢業以後，不多是沈淪下位嗎？反之，那些整日開會，專事活動的學生，不是在校時有豐富的津貼，出校後有優越的位置嗎？所以現在，讀書不僅無用，抑且有害。從前以爲「書中自有黃金屋，書中自有顏如玉」，可是這樣「死讀書」的結果，在今日必是「讀書死」。現在所需要的是「讀活書」。子路在論語中，也曾說過」何必讀書，然後爲學？」離開講堂到社會去，乃是正經。然則又何必有學校呢？那末我可以回答說，爲了將來的生活，賢格與文憑是不能不耍的啊。應而言之，今日的學校只是一個製造資格與文憑以出賣的工廠或商舖而已。而我國的所謂大學，尤十足的表示了道種商業賣買的性質。</p>
<p>大學生的作風</p>
<p>因爲如此，所以就中國的敎育來說，成緩最糟的是大學，次之是中學，比較好的是小學。但是就國家所化費於敎育的經費來講，比率最大的是大學，次之是中學，數目最小的是小學。（事變前的國聯考察團報告，舊明白的指出這一點。爲什麼小學的經費要比大中學少呢？這理由很簡單，因爲小學生沒有什麼利用價値，至多可以在什麼耍人面前作爲搖旗吶喊及送往迎來的羣衆而已。然則經費最少的小學，又爲什麼成績倒反最好呢？那末一句話可以回答說，就因爲經費過少，所以比較的少有人去尋事生風，學校比較安定，辦學的雖在艱難困苦之中，也可有若干計畫，逐漸求其實現了。反之，大學因爲經費較多，並且所謂大學生者又是最具有利用價値的徒衆，故在那些圖謀發展出路的政客，大學遂成爲必須爭奪的對象。教育機關常隨着政潮的起伏而變化，當然不會有好的成績。而這情形，我們可說在事變前如此，在事變以後也還此風未變，同時，在抗戰區與在和平區的，也是伯仲之間，並無二致。</p>
<p>至於說大中小學成績的優劣，究竟何在，則我可以根據平時觀察所得，例舉一二以爲說明。我們知道敎育的一個重要目的，在養成兒童對人的一種親切的態度。所以孔門六藝，禮居基首。而今日靑少年中，最無禮貌者則爲受着高等敎育的大學生。我們看到小學生對於師長照例是立定鞠躬，中學生就不然了，他們對於先生，終算還知敬禮，大抵是點頭了事，至於大學生，那就氣燄萬丈，根本目中無人，視而無見，好像於相干的路人。小學生對敎師是視爲尊長，中學生則以平輩友朋相視，而大學生那就無異傭人。本來，師道之不尊，由來巳久，韓文公曾深致其慨嘆，不過無論如何，沒有墮落到今日中國的大學生——尤其是上海的大學生那樣罷。學生平時對於師長尙是如此，對於其他人們，更可想見。因此，一般公司商號的用人，往往不要學生，而寗用舊式徒弟制度出身的人物。</p>
<p>缺乏求知精神</p>
<p>又敎育上還有一件重大的事情，是對於讀書求學的態度。那末今日的大學生便是最缺乏求知的精神的。小學生對於一件事情，有不理會處，往往會執而不捨的問師長，問父母，中學生就不十分發問了，到了大學生則以問人爲可恥，於是就率性不理會是怎麼一回事。例如上課，小學生是眞正上課聽講，中學生多是心不在焉，身在課堂，心在校外，至於大學生則痛快不上課，在大學生的課堂中，全體出席，無一缺課，那簡直是破大荒的奇事，照例是七零八落，遲到早退的。所以有人說小學生是眞謂書，中學生是假讀書，大學生則不讀書。其實，大學生關心的事情也太多了，旣耍參加政治組織，又要從事社會運動，此外則戀愛，看戲，跳舞，也是日常生活中重耍的節目，呌他們一身怎麼能忙得過來呢？因此之故，今日的學生靑年，若間他們以中國歷史上的著名事件或人物，往往會莫明其妙，答非所問，但若說起電影與明星，則對其故事人物，莫不滾瓜爛熟、把出名的男女明星，作爲崇拜信仰的對象。墻上貼的，桌上放的、書中夾的，都是明星的相片。明星一到，萬人空巷、其中是多的是男女學生。我眞不知道這是呌作什麼敎育！然而今則上以是倡，下以是從·要人們捧明星，專車迎送，躬自招待，於是影響所及，舉國從風，流風餘沫，方興未文矣。</p>

<h3>參加茶會的感想</h3>
<p>— 楊錦兆</p>
<p>陳市長丁部長舉行茶會，商討提高中小學敎職員待遇。我以一市立小學校長的資格參加茶會。聽了各位的宏論，發生了不少感想，</p>
<p>第一，市校敎員待遇·比較私校苦·這是不容否認的事實。在待遇沒有增加以前·發生下列三種現象：優秀師資的棄職改行，留職者是不安於位，一而所謂「潰竿」者，也以屬身敎界，爲迸渡時代的稿樣，一有他職，棄之而去。高級級任老師的聘請難於上靑天。現在不是師資低劣，兒童程度差等等，而是好敎師走完了怎麼辦的問題？敎育界的危機，由於待遇低微，穩伏已久，於今更甚。目前自五月起，至暑假前止，補助敎職員生活費，原則總算確定。但我們不能遺忘，除了敎職員外，還有校工，他們也是敎育界的苦力。市校工役待遇，按月薪矛祗四百二十六元，距離遍飽·坦差遠甚。</p>
<p>其次，市校各校長聯名，員市府，員工待遇，每人增加至每月四千五百元，市庫文絀，徒屬奢望，有待下半年度市財政的調整，敎育經費合，理增加。假定員薪每月增加二千元，由家長體忘敎師淸苦，本學期按月捐輸。以本校營之，共計十二學級，二十敎員，五校工。因校址位居滬四，學生家境，大多淸寒。六百餘學生，通扯每名每月三十元，約二萬左右，尙少三萬元之多。經濟情形，比本校不如的還有。依據林局長茶會上報吿：「市校敎員·一千五百名」。應增三百萬元·不敷至少一百五十萬。併計私校在內，至七月底止·超出五百萬以上。勢非學生家長及社會各界的熟烈資助，是無法解決的。</p>
<p>吳秘書長說：「事情要辦得好，是製度，人車，經費的總和」·而三者的重心還是經費。譬如敎育經費吧：戰前上海公立學校，待遇較內地爲優。近年敎育界，尤其是市校，江河日下，經費少，待過差，是主要的原因。一二年前，有筵席捐擴大開徵消費特稅了。在未爲消費特稅前，所收捐稅，如何開支，希望財政當局公布。如果沒有移用，我們期待充作這次改善中小學臨時經費的用途。</p>
<p>我自己承認，教育界固然有不少人士，抱定「我不入地獄，誰入地獄」的精神，而苦幹。但也有多少同志，受了生活的打擊，是頹唐了。陷入半怠工狀能，遺下不良的影響。然而錯了！這次參加茶會後，我感覺社會期待我們的殷切，對於敎育界入士生活的痛苦，無不抱有極大的同情，各報將設立的館榖助金，對於我們精神的影響，格外重大。我是一個主持校政者，代表一單位，表示向關切各方的感謝，並願以心力盡瘁敎育事業。敎育界同志，奮起邁進，作本位的努力·預祝上海敎育光明的前途！</p>

<h3>推進科學研究工作之建議</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>傳其釗</p>
<p>我國政治之最大悲劇爲浪費過甚，行政攘籌龐大，駢枝太多，乃至無統一之目標，無統一之步驟，結果是政出多門，毫無成績可言；且凡事但知荀且，不求澈底。若欲提倡科學之研究，政府必需有確切之目標，通盤之計劃，嚴整之標準，必成之信念。必需不惜任何代價，督促科學之進步，其收效最宏且速者，依筆者之愚見，約有下列數點：</p>
<p>敎育制度之改良吾國敎育制度之不良，爲盡人皆知之事實。我國急體改良敎育制度，傚日德諸國，普遍設立高等技術工業學校，使一般智力較差之學生能獲得一專門技術，爲國服務；智力較優之學生則昇入大學，作更高深之研究·此種制度能養成科學界之技術人員學指導人負，積極的發展工業。又國家必需予高等學校畢業生以便利之出路，如農業瓷業等，使人不畏而却步。</p>
<p>嚴格規定大學之課程　中國一大學生所負之責任實較英國一議員之責任爲更大，故大學生必需經最嚴格之訓練，設立切合實際之工業大學，如美國之麻省工專。大學之中，力求敎授生活之安定，便能專心研究，而濫芋充數之輩則急需淘汰·多方面予學生研究上之便利。各國立大學更以專長之課程向號召，使學生得知選擇，不致浪費。</p>
<p>擴充學校之實騐工作　實騐爲科學之母。今日中國之大學有一最可憐之現象即實騐之缺乏，自然科學若無實騐，則等於不讀。雖然，現在物資缺乏，而化學藥品更有充爲軍用者，但無論如何，政府對於各學校之實騐工作必需維持·滬上之大學，（皆陷入於實騐停頓之慘狀之中，政府應極力設法救濟。</p>
<p>普遍提倡人民對於科學之興趣　多設公開講座，公開實騐，使人民對於科學發生興趣，而求實際之應用</p>
<p>設立國立研究院、爲中央研究院等，廣集圖書，編印雜誌，收集材料，定標準度量街，廣攬高深研究人員·同時對於有成績之私人研究，應作種種經濟上學術上之帮助。設立國家性之年獎，鼓勵研究者之發現，並獎勵社會有力團體及工商組織設立小規模之實騐室，維持從業員之研究工作。</p>
<p>國家者建設工程，飭令研究員致力研究，或聘外人爲顧問，唯不能請外人代營</p>
<p>嚴格檢查化學工廠，藥廠、儀器廠之出品，務需切合標準，不可使國人對本顧獲缺乏信仰。</p>
<p>派尃家出國留學務需有一定之目標，壽國後必能有所建樹，否則即爲浪費。</p>
<p>釐定計劃，如蘇聯之五年計劃然，在一定期限之內，必需成立若干工廠及研究院，如硫酸廠，顏料廠，金錠研究院等。</p>
<p>重金品全給你外人爲指導，對於最基本之襪械如火車之正氣機極汽車之內燃機等必需刻能自己製造</p>
<p>政府必須提出「人才至上，生產至上」之中心思想，在此思想之下，學生，研究人員敎授等理投前進。對於外國之進步固宜介紹。對於本國之進步更宜宣傳，使圖人有充分之自信。</p>
<p>對於科學化之新與工業應竭力保護，對於舊式之手工業則令其逐漸改善使合乎科學化。</p>

<h3>海軍　岩田豐雄善洪</h3>
<p>— 洋譯</p>
<p>到東京去，也爲了不要萬一與回校去的眞人坐了一個車，所以特別繞道，而坐日豐線的火車。隆夫從別府坐船到了大阪，然後第一次坐上了寫着「往東京」的火車。</p>
<p>到達東京車站時，他的腰中還剩三百多元。他住的旅館，是在旅行指南的廣吿欄內，用頭號字登載着一宿一元五的本鄕區的旅館。而第二天，跑到上野地方的美術學校去，請求入學，然而因並非是招生期，且困中學未畢業，於是遭受到了閑門　。</p>
<p>（他媽的！）</p>
<p>隆夫認爲不入官立美術學校，也算不了什麼事。他認爲，東京是大的·與官立美術學校並駕齊驅的私立學校，一定是數不勝數的。結果，在報紙廣吿欄內，發見了「東京美術大學院」的好聽校名。</p>
<p>東京美術大學院，是在谷中區的偏僻陋巷寺町街裏。是旣無校門，而又無校舍的一個學校。當然，也不做松下村熟那樣一無所有，所以並不能過於輕視。是兩層建築的長方形的大房，在方格門的裏圖，有嬰兒啼哭的聲，，這眞是別有　味的一個學校</p>
<p>「對不起，可以進去麼？」</p>
<p>隆夫儘量說著標準的國語。</p>
<p>最初，抱着着嬰兒的一位夫人出來了，然後又出來了一位長着鬍鬚，而穿着寬外衣的主人。</p>
<p>「我們並不直接敎授的。」</p>
<p>他詳詳細細地注視着麼夫的樣子，而這樣說「那末，廣吿上爲什麼有……」</p>
<p>「吿上雖有，但人數够足數時，才開始上課的。同時，受特別直接敎授的人，按我們的章程·是先要讀講義而取得基本知識的……」</p>
<p>東京美術大學院，原來是發行畫圖講義的地方。最後，隆夫只好買了一年的講義，用粗繩子捆着，帶回本鄕的旅館去。購買講義，自然也要像別人一樣，花了二十多元錢。然而一看講義的內容，原來全是糊裏糊塗的活字羅列，其實這也是意中事。</p>
<p>然而隆夫並未因此而氣餒。</p>
<p>（他媽的！）</p>
<p>在第二天，又信步游蕩，去找新的美術學校。東京的名勝·電影·茶館等，都引不起他的注意。他只是一心一意想當畫家。在心坎裏，如不早一天開始學習當畫家，是總不能安定的。</p>
<p>不幾天後，他逐漸認識了所謂東京這樣寬大而且神秘的都會眞面目。</p>

<h3>Weekly Review: Collection of Essays by Tosuke Yoshida, Volume 2 - Preface</h3>
<p>— Tosuke Yoshida</p>
<p>The second volume of my essay collection and the Japanese version of "Japan's Reflection and China's Innovation" have been published simultaneously. This book also includes the preface to the Japanese version of the essay collection. Readers only need to read it once to understand my intention in publishing this book, so this volume does not require a dedicated preface. However, here, I need to say a few more words to Chinese readers. I believe that the readers who can best understand my words at this stage are not the Japanese people I most want to read this book, but the Chinese people. I believe that Japanese readers, especially those who quickly left China and do not understand the actual situation on the ground, have not yet fully understood my words. I firmly believe that in the near future, Japanese readers will understand my intentions as well as Chinese readers. However, at present, those who fiercely criticize my words as heresy still echo across the river. Furthermore, I believe that perhaps because of this book, I will be rejected by the people of my beloved motherland. Even in that unfortunate situation, I still firmly believe that my view of China is the correct direction for Japan to take. At the same time, I also believe that Chinese readers in that situation will support my correct words even more. This is because Chinese readers are the most qualified judges of articles about China.</p>
<p>However, some readers may feel uncomfortable because the author of this essay collection is Japanese. Therefore, they conclude that all Japanese words, even if they seem correct at first glance, definitely have ulterior motives at heart. I understand the feelings of these readers very well, and I want to answer them. No matter what position I take, I am still Japanese. Being Japanese, I love Japan and hope for Japan's development. So, for the sake of Japan's development, if sacrificing China is necessary, then perhaps I would use cultural work to deceive or anesthetize the Chinese people for this purpose. Now, let's take ten thousand steps back and assume that I am such a person, and assume that I am publishing this essay collection for such a purpose.</p>
<p>Consider a Japanese story. A certain villain wanted to deceive a compassionate feudal lord in order to get the lord to reward him. So, this person, who was usually not filial, carried his elderly mother on his back in a place where the lord could see him, feigning filial piety in every possible way. The lord saw this and greatly admired his filial piety, immediately bestowing a sum of money upon him. However, later, it became clear that he was a notorious rogue who was pretending to be filial to his mother in order to deceive the lord and get the reward. The lord's family members were very angry and wanted to catch the villain and punish him. But the lord did not allow it, saying: I knew long ago that this fellow was a bad egg. However, even if he is a bad egg, if he pretends to be a filial son, he can get a reward. If people understand this point, they will imitate this bad egg and pretend to be filial. If the whole society pretends to be filial, then there is hope for creating good customs and beautiful traditions in a society of bad people.</p>
<p>Just as that feudal lord correctly pointed out, no matter what the actor's motivation is, once the behavior is expressed externally, the behavior itself is divorced from the actor's motivation and has its own objectivity. For example, a person who is not good at drawing wants to draw a tiger subjectively. With a stroke of the brush, what is drawn does not look like a tiger, but like a cat. Then, objectively, this is a cat picture. Now, even if I subjectively intend to deceive and anesthetize the Chinese people by writing articles, if the articles themselves are objectively truth, then they naturally have cultural value. What I want to solemnly point out here is that the cultural work itself and the author's personality are not the same thing, but have their own objectivity. I hope that readers will objectively criticize the articles collected in this essay collection, saying that what is correct is correct, and saying that what is wrong is wrong. As for saying that the same work is wrong if written by a Japanese person, and correct if written by a Chinese person, this kind of nationalistic attitude is already outdated. Japanese and Chinese people are originally all nations whose emotions are easily aroused. If strong emotions are guided by good reason, they can do good things. However, if they are used by external bad people, they can make big and terrible mistakes. When the emotions of the two major nations are intense, it is difficult to calm them down. However, the current era is very urgently demanding that the two major nations calmly listen to reason. In short, this essay collection should not be judged based on whether the author is Japanese or a Hottentot. All objectively correct statements should be praised as correct, and no judgments should be made based on whether the author is Chinese or an Eskimo, and all errors should be severely criticized as errors. Moreover, in this era, I firmly believe that Japan's development is impossible if China does not develop. At the same time, true Asian liberation is impossible if the two major nations of China and Japan do not truly unite. I hope that Chinese readers will not criticize my articles based on the fact that I am Japanese, but will use reason and discuss the articles themselves. If I am wrong, please correct me with a comrade's attitude. This is my earnest request to Chinese readers. (Translated by Lu)</p>
<h3>Marshal Koga's Honorable Death in Battle: Our Government and Public Extend Condolences; Minister Ren Hai Chang and Minister Lin, Among Others, Express Their Thoughts</h3>
<p>Nanjing, June 6th, Central News Agency report: The Allied General Headquarters announced yesterday that Admiral Mineichi Koga, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, honorably died in battle this March while commanding operations on the front lines. Vice Admiral Soemu Toyoda has been appointed to succeed him. After the news was released, all sectors here, from the government to the public, expressed deep condolences. Since taking over as Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet last April, Admiral Koga had overcome difficulties, stood at the forefront, commanded calmly, established brilliant achievements, demonstrated the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy, and inflicted great setbacks on the enemy. His spirit of not fearing sacrifice, of being loyal and brave in serving the country, and of fighting for the liberation of East Asia, strengthens the determination of the one billion people of East Asia, amidst mourning, to destroy the old enemy and complete the war.</p>
<p>Central News Agency report: Marshal Koga of the Ming Union Japanese Joint Fleet, commanded the battle on the front lines and honorably sacrificed his life. Yesterday, the reporter especially visited Ren Hai Chang, and Principal Jiang of the Central Naval Academy, and the following are their expressed thoughts:</p>
<p>Ren Hai Chang:</p>
<p>Admiral Koga has assisted our country's navy construction very much, and my personal friendship with him is very deep. This time, following Marshal Yamamoto, he gave his life for his country, and the people of both countries extend their condolences. But "death in battle" is the supreme glory for a soldier. Because of Admiral Koga's grand sacrifice, the people of both countries will increase their hatred for the enemy and their determination to work together, and become even more invigorated. If so, then Admiral Koga's spirit can be comforted, and victory in the war can also be demonstrated as a result, because the operation of the army depends entirely on the morale of the soldiers. Looking at the repeated victories of the Allied Navy after Marshal Yamamoto's death in battle, the destruction of Britain and the United States can be expected in the near future.</p>
<p>Principal Jiang:</p>
<p>I had many opportunities to get close to Commander Koga when he was in Shanghai, and I have long admired his high personality. Later, when he was honorably transferred to the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, I felt that his extraordinary courage was worthy of congratulations. Recently, I was shocked to hear the news of his death in battle, and I deeply feel that my past admiration was not in vain. In terms of the Greater East Asia War, we extend our sincere gratitude to him, but with the admiration of the past, my heart is truly overwhelmed with sorrow. Since I placed myself in the New Navy and cooperated with the Allied Navy officers and soldiers, I have greatly admired their learning and training, and their officers' strict and pure cultivation, especially, is beyond our reach. Admiral Koga's awe-inspiring and immortal spirit is not only a model for the spirit of our New Navy, but also a guarantee for the victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Minister Lin:</p>
<p>Nanjing, June 6th, Central News Agency report: Marshal Koga, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Navy, was honorably killed in action. Our government and people are in mourning. Propaganda Minister Lin, especially expressed his remarks yesterday, The Allied Navy Combined Fleet Commander-in-Chief Marshal Koga, did not avoid danger this time, personally went to the front lines to command operations, and therefore died in battle. The people of the National Government, in addition to their grief, deeply admire the greatness of the traditional spirit of the Allied Navy. The Allied Navy held this spirit, all officers and soldiers were determined to serve the country, bravely made sacrifices, and were loyal to their duties. Therefore, since the outbreak of the war, they have been victorious in every battle and invincible in every attack. When the war situation becomes more intense, they can be more strictly prepared to meet the enemy, so that any conspiracy of the enemy's counterattack has nowhere to use its skills. This spirit is the greatest grasp of decisive victory in the naval battle of the Greater East Asia War, and also the most solid cornerstone of the Great Wall of Ten Thousand Miles in East Asia. General Toyota took over as Commander-in-Chief. The Allied Navy is determined to inherit the spirit of Marshals Yamamoto and Koga and continue to struggle. To repay the family, to protect East Asia. Although Marshals Yamamoto and Koga did not see the final battle results, the glorious victory of the Greater East Asia decisive battle will surely comfort the spirits of the two marshals in heaven, and can be predicted.</p>
<p>The Emperor Bestowed the Title of Marshal</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 5th, Central News Agency report: The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 5th: His Majesty the Emperor, in recognition of Admiral Mineichi Koga, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, for his offensive actions, especially bestowed the title of Marshal, listed him in the Marshal's Office, awarded him the First Class Order of Merit, the Order of the Rising Sun Paulownia Flowers Grand Cordon, and was awarded the third rank.</p>
<h3>In the West of Yu-Ping-Han Railway in Henan, the Japanese Army Repeatedly Won Victories, Occupying Jia County, Yu County, and Linru.</h3>
<p>Henan Frontline, June 6th, Central News Agency report: Yu Army and the 91st Division Commander Jin Yingbai, 93rd Division Commander Yang Wei, and the 21st Division Commander Liu Chen, directly under the 31st Army Group, all under Ma Liwu's command, totaling more than 10,000 men, attempted to go north from Yu County. The elite Japanese troops divided into multiple task forces and launched a surprise attack. The Japanese army went straight to Yu County (70 kilometers southwest of Zhengzhou,) and surrounded it from three sides, further cutting off its route to the north. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack on the city on the 3rd. The Yu garrison of more than 8,000 men engaged in a fierce bayonet battle. In the evening, they broke into a corner of Yu County. On the morning of the 4th, they completely occupied the area and are still advancing.</p>
<p>Henan Frontline, June 6th, Central News Agency report: After occupying Jia County, the Japanese army's vanguard forces successively and rapidly defeated the enemy, advancing bravely along the highway from Linru to Jia County. Furthermore, they launched a fierce attack on the 117th Division Commander Liu Mantian, under the command of the Chiang Kai-shek's 13th Army, with approximately 8,000 men, entrenched in Linru, at dawn on the 3rd. Afterwards, the main force of the Japanese infantry launched a frontal assault from the east, with a portion also advancing from north to south. That evening, the enemy finally could not withstand it, and the Japanese army completely captured Linru, breaking into the enemy's deep defense line. Linru is Tang Enbo's second line of defense, with a dangerous terrain, built with cement fortifications, and equipped with a training institute for Yu special agents. It occupies an important position both geographically and politically.</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 5th, Central News Agency report: Henan Frontline report on the 6th, the Japanese army completely occupied Jiao County (70 kilometers west of Xuchang), which was defended to the death by the Yu 22nd Division, on the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Yu and the US Attempts Were All Foiled</h3>
<p>Hankou, June 6th, Central News Agency report: The First War Zone Army under Jiang Dingwen, possessing 40 divisions, totaling 400,000 men, lost its only stronghold in North China since the Central Plains Battle in the 30th year. At the same time, its combat power declined. For three years, it could only lie dormant along the Jinghan line on the south bank of the Yellow River and the Funiu Mountains. After the enemy and the US forces began their counter-offensive against Japan, the army received the Chongqing order of "victory in the war", attempting to launch a general counter-offensive against Japan, hoping to recapture North China, and began preparations. On May 1st of last year, Jiang Dingwen, commander of the First War Zone, began to formulate methods. The first was to strengthen the army's divisions, implement military construction, replenish equipment, and form mechanized units. The second was to build storage depots in the war zone to prepare for air control against Japan, or to bomb Manchuria. The third was to improve the increase in combat power, focusing on the increase of morale, and mobilizing the people's power of the entire war zone. The center of the enemy's war zone defense is the mountainous area west of the Yellow River, mainly in Fanshui, and the large plain of Henan along the Jinghan line. The main battlefields were Fanshui and Dengfeng Linru, on the battle line between the Funiu Mountains, with a total length of 200 kilometers and a width of tens of kilometers, with many war-army heavy artillery. Furthermore, trenches were dug in the Xin Yellow River area, covering trenches and various positions to prevent the Japanese army's tank offensive. In particular, Tang Enbo, the most trusted by Chiang Kai-shek among the Chongqing generals, was transferred as an adjutant to grasp the actual power of defense in that war zone. The affiliated troops totaled 4 army groups, reaching 250,000, working hard to cultivate combat power, and changing the deployment of various armies last fall, in order to enhance the defense of the Yellow River. At the same time, Jiang Dingwen held a military conference in Luoyang on January 20 to discuss the plan for a general counter-offensive against North China. On the one hand, US generals and officers in Chongqing inspected the military situation in war zones such as Luoyang Yecheng and other places. US Air Force in Chongqing expanded and prepared air force bases in more than a dozen places such as Nanyang and Yecheng in Henan, so that the heavy bomber force could take off and land freely. They were actively preparing for a general counter-offensive against Japan on both land and air. Unexpectedly, in this Henan operation, they were attacked by the preemptive attack of the Japanese army, and annihilation operations were launched one after another in various places. The Chongqing army not only failed to launch a counter-offensive, but instead suffered this heavy blow.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Guangxi</h3>
<p>A certain base, June 6th, Central News Agency report: A Japanese army dive bomber squadron raided the US Air Force forward base in Danzhu Airport, Guilin Province, on May 5th, and the attached military facilities were severely damaged. On that day, the Yu aircraft did not intercept, nor did anti-aircraft fire retaliate. All Japanese aircraft have safely returned to base.</p>
<h3>Gu and Zhou Grain Administration Embezzlement Case: Sentence Reduced to Ten Years; Other Accomplices Still Handed Over to the Original Court for Trial.</h3>
<p>Nanjing, June 6th, Central News Agency report: The case of the former Minister of Food Gu Heng and Vice Minister Zhou Naiwen, handling grain administration embezzlement, has been legally concluded by a special court, and each was sentenced to death. After submitting to the Chairman of the National Government for review, the Chairman, considering that Gu and Zhou stepped forward to take on difficult tasks during the food panic of the past two years and were quite laborious, and to show fairness in both emotion and law, specially reduced their sentences to ten years of imprisonment each. As for other accomplices, they were still handed over to the court for trial and review. The National Government has instructed the special court on the 6th to comply. The judgment and government order are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"National Government Special Court Judgment, Special Character No. 2 of the 33rd Year.</p>
<p>Gu Heng, male, 42 years old, from Nantong County, Jiangsu Province. Resident of No. 10, Gulou Fourth Alley, Nanjing City, former Minister of Food.</p>
<p>Zhou Naiwen, male, 57 years old, from Yixing, Jiangsu. Resident of No. 4, Cibei Society, Nanjing, former Vice Minister of Food. The right defendant is hereby sentenced by this court for the crime of accepting bribes and other crimes, as follows.</p>
<p>Main Text: Gu Heng and Zhou Naiwen, jointly and continuously, during wartime, with the intention of profiting, speculated and manipulated daily necessities, sufficient to hinder the relationship between supply and demand, and were each sentenced to death, and each was deprived of civil rights for life, and encroached upon public property held in official capacity, and were each sentenced to life imprisonment, and each was deprived of civil rights for life, and shall each be executed, and each shall be deprived of civil rights for life. The illegal profits obtained by Gu Heng, totaling 11.2 million yuan, and the illegal profits obtained by Zhou Naiwen, totaling 800,000 yuan, shall be recovered and confiscated.</p>
<p>National Government Directive May 6th, 33rd Year Order to the National Government Special Court</p>
<p>Submitted on May 5th of the 33rd year, being the case of Gu Heng and Zhou Naiwen, handling grain administration embezzlement, together with the case file, requesting review and instruction for compliance.</p>
<p>The submission and case file have been reviewed. Gu Heng and Zhou Naiwen are clearly proven to have amassed wealth for personal gain and encroached upon public funds, and they are fully deserving of their punishment. However, it is found that in January of the 31st year, when food was scarce and military and civilian food were both difficult, Gu Heng and Zhou Naiwen stepped forward to take on difficult tasks, and for two years, their measures and planning were quite laborious. Although they were severely punished because of their lack of self-discipline, considering their past labor, their sentences are especially reduced at the end to show fairness in both emotion and law. Gu Heng and Zhou Naiwen are each reduced to ten years of imprisonment. The rest shall be executed as originally sentenced. As for other accomplices, they shall be handed over to the court for trial and review. The judgment shall be kept, and the original case file shall be returned. This order. It is calculated that four original case files shall be returned. Chairman Wang Zhaoming."</p>

<h3>Rainy Season Approaches in India Front; Japanese Air Force Bomb Enemy Airfield; Enemy Troops' Morale Shaken by Large-Scale Formation</h3>
<p>Rangoon, June 6th, Central News Agency report: The enemy air force dare-to-die team has been trapped in a state of blockade as a result of the Japanese air and land attack. Now that the US Air Force seems to be starting to stir again, the Japanese Air Force, in view of this, raided the enemy's Linamitham Calling Airfield with a low-altitude bombing squadron on the 4th. The airfield was parked with six Douglas No. 3 aircraft and eleven large gliders. Flying in from a distance, the enemy aviation soldiers were walking on the airfield, seemingly unaware of the Japanese Air Force's attack. After the Japanese Air Force flew from the clouds to the airspace above the airfield, the squadron leader immediately led the implementation of ultra-low-altitude bombing, dropping many giant bombs, completely destroying six Douglas aircraft and eleven gliders. More than a hundred enemy soldiers were caught off guard and were all killed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 6th, Central News Agency report: A Japanese army base on the India-Burma front reports that after the news of the approach of the Japanese-Indian allied forces to Imphal reached the Assam region, the residents of the area were extremely excited. Residents of Imphal gathered in various parts of the city, especially the Manipuris and Indians. Taking advantage of the fact that the British were unable to suppress them, they densely gathered on the outskirts of Imphal and discussed the strategy after the arrival of the Japanese and Indian armies.</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 5th, Central News Agency report: According to a dispatch from a certain place on the India-Burma border front, the India-Burma front will enter the rainy season. After the enemy troops were lured into the Imphal basin, they are now deploying a large rotating formation, receiving food and ammunition from the air, and desperately resisting the fierce attack of the Japanese army, waiting for the arrival of the rainy season. Now, the enemy troops in this large rotating formation are extremely demoralized due to repeated failures.</p>
<h3>Gandhi's Health Weakens; Regains Freedom Yesterday; Many Confidants Also Released on the Same Day</h3>
<p>Lisbon, June 6th, Central News Agency report: German News Agency reports: According to New Delhi sources, the Indian government announced today the release of Gandhi. According to the announcement, this unconditional release is based entirely on Gandhi's health considerations. After his release, Mr. Gandhi was sent by Prison Inspector Colonel Barndari to the home of Mrs. Kalhor Saif in Balnagar, a close friend of Mr. Gandhi. In May 1934, Mr. Gandhi fasted for ten days in Mrs. Kalhor Saif's home.</p>
<p>Lisbon, June 6th, Central News Agency report: According to a telegram from Pune, after Gandhi left the Aga Khan Palace on the 6th, his symptoms were published by two attending physicians as follows: Gandhi has been in poor health since April 10, and his symptoms worsened on the 14th. Since the 16th, his body temperature has increased, showing malaria-like symptoms, and his blood pressure is low. Although he is very weak, his spirit is still cheerful. Friends and acquaintances hope that he can fully recuperate.</p>
<p>Amsterdam, June 6th, Central News Agency report: German News Agency reports: According to reports from Pune, in addition to Gandhi himself, the British-Indian authorities have also released Miss Miraben, the daughter of a certain British navy lieutenant general, as well as Dr. Kilde Mayer (a former member of the Bombay government) and Gandhi's female secretary.</p>
<h3>England's Cunning and Vicious Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – An individual deeply familiar with the situation in India recently criticized England's cunning policy of releasing Gandhi as follows: The authorities of violent England released Gandhi on the 6th. There are two reasons for releasing Gandhi: Since Japan's successful invasion of India, the morale of the people within the country has been shaken. England has had no choice but to compromise with the Indian people. This is a shift from a policy of suppression to a superficial democracy, and it symbolizes their deceptive tactics towards the masses, which have remained consistent from the past to the present. Gandhi recently suffered from malaria and was on the verge of death. England feared that Gandhi would die in prison and, to avoid responsibility, released him. Judging from the announcement by the Governor-General of India, the first reason is quite believable. After news of Gandhi and Nehru suffering in prison spread, the Indian people unanimously demanded the release of the leaders of the Congress Party, but the Governor-General of India consistently refused. The fact that Gandhi is now being released is due to his advanced stage of illness. The shrewd English, seeing that Gandhi is about to die, aim to avoid responsibility and, at the same time, appease the Indian people with this move. Their vicious cunning has reached its peak. Why does England only release Gandhi and not Nehru and others who are suffering in prison? From this perspective, England's true intentions are very clear.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft and Boats Clash Near Rabaul</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from San Francisco, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Headquarters announced on the 4th that during an "unfortunate battle" near Rabaul, American fighter planes and fast boats lost two aircraft and suffered multiple casualties. A broadcast from the Tras base in New Guinea also reported that on the 30th, American fighter planes mistook friendly fast boats for Japanese boats and attacked them, causing them to run aground. The fast boats also shot down one of the fighter planes. Other fast boats that came to rescue the grounded boat were also attacked by fighter planes, but one of the attacking planes was soon shot down. Both aircraft sustained heavy damage.</p>
<h3>Military Attachés from Various Countries Stationed in Japan Inspect Captured Weapons</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Military attachés from Japan's Axis allies, including China, Germany, Italy, Romania, France, Manchuria, and the Philippines, formed a tour group and visited the Tama River Exhibition Hall at 2 PM on the 5th. As they were all military experts, they were very enthusiastic when observing the enemy's weapons. The group paid particular attention to the spoils of war captured in Singapore. At that time, Lieutenant Colonel Asakuno of the General Staff Headquarters and Lieutenant Colonel Sawada of the Army Press Department provided detailed explanations of everything. After an hour-long tour, a discussion meeting was held. Romanian Major General Radolescu expressed his gratitude, saying: "Seeing so many captured weapons symbolizing the Japanese army's victory, I can only express my gratitude and wish the Japanese army continued success."</p>
<h3>Korea Actively Increases Rice and Grain Production; Youth Training Achieves Excellent Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – The recent situation in the Korean peninsula is as follows: Since the Governor-General of Korea announced the implementation of the conscription system on August 1st of last year, the 25 million compatriots on the peninsula have been filled with joy and gratitude. A total of 220,000 people are eligible for conscription, of which 110,000 have not yet received education. As a result of special youth training since Showa 17 (1942), excellent results have been achieved. In the past, when the volunteer system was implemented in Showa 13 (1938), there were already two who served as second lieutenants, more than one hundred non-commissioned officers, and dozens who died in battle. It is believed that the conscripts this time will definitely inherit this aspiration and become outstanding members of the Imperial Army. Regarding the public sentiment within Korea, it has gradually become solid, and there is no cause for concern. However, the ideological trends of the masses on the peninsula, who lack education, cannot be said to require no attention. To address this, education must be continued, and loyal elements must be thoroughly valued to prevent them from being taken advantage of by unstable elements. Regarding rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, harvests in the 17th and 18th years were not as good as in previous years due to natural disasters. However, a production responsibility system has been established for this year. The production target is 26 million koku of rice (the average annual production is 23.3 million koku), and 20 million koku of wheat and miscellaneous grains (the average annual production is 16 million koku). The production responsibility has been shared between landowners and producers. Furthermore, due to favorable weather this year, it is expected that the honor of Korea as a granary can be restored without any problems. Since free maritime transport between the mainland and Korea has been changed to land transport, the transport bridge between the mainland and Korea and the Korean transport business are becoming increasingly strengthened. The previous transport rate for passengers and goods has now changed, with passengers accounting for only 16%. In addition, both the Gyeongui and Gyeongbu lines are being urgently rebuilt as double tracks, but there are some difficulties in terms of transporting materials.</p>
<h3>England and America Lift Oil Embargo on Spain</h3>
<p>Bilbao, 6th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: The Spanish oil tanker "Sotelo" departed from here yesterday for Aruba to transport 10,000 tons of oil back to Spain. In addition, five oil tankers in Malaga, Seville, Barcelona, and Piva-Ixia will soon depart for Central America to transport 38,000 tons of oil. Therefore, according to the treaty recently established between Spain, England, and America, 41,000 tons of oil will be supplied each month, and the amount supplied in May will safely reach Spain.</p>
<h3>Air Raids on the European Continent Every Day; Many American Planes Shot Down Attacking Romania</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports, military news: A large formation of American bombers attacked the Romanian capital yesterday afternoon, and at least 52 were shot down. Before the enemy planes even reached Romanian territory, the German and Romanian air forces shot down more than ten of them over the Danube River. The Romanian capital used concentrated anti-aircraft fire to repel the enemy planes. Several enemy four-engine planes were hit in the air and destroyed. It is believed that in addition to the above-mentioned 52 planes, many more were damaged and unable to return to their bases.</p>
<h3>Roman City Area Bombed Again</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: Yesterday, American bomber groups heavily bombed the densely populated eastern area of Rome. This was the first large-scale bombing after Irish Prime Minister Eamon de Valera requested the belligerent nations to protect Rome and Germany guaranteed that Rome was a demilitarized city. In the past 24 hours, there have been no major developments in the air war in Europe. The anti-Axis air force continues to focus on bombing transportation lines in German-occupied areas of Western Europe and Western Germany. Several enemy planes targeted France last night and dropped bombs in the Cologne and Mannheim areas. Eleven American planes were shot down.</p>
<h3>Turkey Holds Air Defense Drill</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 6th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: A test air raid alarm was issued here on the evening of the 5th, and the public remained calm as usual. It is reported that there had been no blackout or air raid drills since 1940.</p>
<h3>England and America to Hold Invasion of Europe Prayer Day</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: According to a message from London today, the Church of England authorities plan to hold a national prayer day when the invasion of Europe begins. The United States also has a similar proposal, and New York Governor Dewey has ordered that all churches in New York State must hold prayers on the day the invasion of Europe begins.</p>
<h3>War News from the Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency military reporter Saito commented on the current situation of the European war, stating that the possibility of an Anglo-American attack on Western Europe is becoming increasingly apparent. The Soviet army's offensive northwest of Iasi on Tuesday can be regarded as a major battle preceding the expected large-scale offensive. Before this large-scale Soviet offensive, there were only local battles, and both sides were generally improving their offensive and defensive positions before the outbreak of a major battle.</p>
<h3>Today's Education in China</h3>
<p>— Fan Zhongyun</p>
<p>Educators Inferior to Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>In this day and age, most people consider matters of education and culture to be insignificant and despise them. Because in times of war, "victory is first"—and second, of course, is not "failure," but it is certainly not education. As a result, the funding for education and culture is the smallest proportion of the national budget, and the rewards for those engaged in education and culture are meager compared to any other profession. They are truly "beggars" (educators) today. Or perhaps you think I'm exaggerating, then look at the compensation of rickshaw pullers, generally considered the lowest class of society, which far exceeds that of university professors at prestigious national universities. As for primary and secondary school teachers, that goes without saying. So some people think that the Shanghai slang "pain three," should be written as "hua shan," meaning someone who holds a pen and wears a long gown, or "pen three." Because there are many long-gowned figures who hold pens, not necessarily school teachers, but teachers use pens more than others. They use pens in peacetime, red pens to correct papers, and chalk in class. They use three pens in one body, so there is good reason for them to be reduced to "pen three."</p>
<p>Therefore, teachers are the most looked down upon people in today's society, practically equivalent to outcasts. The general view seems to be that teaching is what the most unsuccessful people do. Although there used to be the saying, "All occupations are lowly, only studying is noble," a group of ignorant people can become millionaires overnight. They have money, and money represents everything. According to the Anglo-American view of materialism, money is the meaning of so-called "success." The English word "Success" is all about 洋 (dollars). So wealthy businessmen are today's successful figures. On the other hand, teachers who have fallen to "pen three" or "beggars" are undoubtedly losers in the struggle for survival and deserve to be abandoned.</p>
<p>But having said that, although teachers in primary, secondary, and universities are despised by some people, everyone attaches great importance to the students in these schools. They know that young students are the most useful and precious. Therefore, politicians who strive for advancement are willing to use the money they have worked hard to obtain to subsidize and buy off students. They need a crowd that can cheer them on, and students are the most numerous. They need followers who can blindly obey, and students are the most valuable to exploit. So they need students for welcomes and farewells, and they also need students for meetings and speeches. During parades and celebrations, the most organized ranks are students. And when it comes to destroying opium dens and gambling houses, the most capable thugs are none other than students. However, this is a peaceful area now, so the passionate patriotic stunts from before the incident are no longer needed.</p>
<p>The Commercialization of Students</p>
<p>Originally, the meaning of being a student, literally, is to learn everything in life. The most important thing in life is undoubtedly how to live and seek a prosperous life. But today, the result of studying is that the more you study, the more helpless you become. Look at the university professors with PhDs from gold-standard countries, aren't they having trouble with even three meals a day? Aren't the students who study hardest and get the best grades in school mostly relegated to lower positions after graduation? On the other hand, aren't those students who spend their days in meetings and engaged in activities, receiving generous subsidies while in school and enjoying superior positions after leaving school? So now, studying is not only useless but also harmful. It used to be thought that "there are golden houses in books, there are beautiful women in books," but the result of "studying to death" today is bound to be "reading to death." What is needed now is "reading living books." Zilu in the Analects also said, "Why must one read books before learning?" Leaving the classroom and going into society is the right thing to do. Then why have schools at all? Then I can answer that for the sake of future life, qualifications and diplomas are essential. In other words, today's schools are just factories or shops that produce qualifications and diplomas for sale. And our so-called universities especially show the nature of this kind of commercial buying and selling.</p>
<p>The Style of University Students</p>
<p>Because of this, as far as Chinese education is concerned, the worst is the university, followed by the middle school, and the comparatively better is the primary school. But in terms of the national funds spent on education, the largest proportion is for universities, followed by middle schools, and the smallest amount is for primary schools. (The League of Nations inspection team before the incident clearly pointed this out.) Why is the funding for primary schools less than that for middle schools and universities? The reason is very simple, because primary school students have little utility value, at most they can be used as crowds to wave flags and shout slogans in front of some important people. Then why are the results of primary schools, which receive the least funding, the best? Then one sentence can answer: because there is too little funding, relatively few people try to stir up trouble, the school is relatively stable, and although those running the school are in hardship, they can have some plans and gradually seek to realize them. On the other hand, because universities have more funding, and the so-called university students are the most exploitable followers, universities have become objects that politicians trying to develop their careers must compete for. Educational institutions often change with the rise and fall of political tides, so of course they will not have good results. And we can say that this situation was the case before the incident, and this trend has not changed after the incident. At the same time, there is no difference between the war zone and the peaceful zone.</p>
<p>As for the quality of the results of primary, secondary, and universities, I can cite one or two examples based on my usual observations to illustrate. We know that one important purpose of education is to cultivate a kind attitude towards others in children. Therefore, in the Six Arts of the Confucian school, etiquette is the most important. And today, the most impolite among young people are university students who have received higher education. We see that primary school students as a rule stand and bow to teachers, middle school students are not so. They still know how to show respect to teachers, mostly nodding their heads. As for university students, they are arrogant, with no one in their eyes, seeing but not seeing, like strangers on the road. Primary school students regard teachers as elders, middle school students regard them as peers and friends, and university students regard them as no different from servants. Originally, the disrespect for teachers has been around for a long time. Han Yu deeply lamented it, but in any case, it has not degenerated to the level of today's Chinese university students—especially Shanghai university students. If students usually treat teachers like this, one can imagine how they treat other people. Therefore, general companies and businesses often do not want students, and prefer to use people who come from the old-fashioned apprenticeship system.</p>
<p>Lack of a Spirit of Inquiry</p>
<p>Another important thing in education is the attitude towards reading and studying. Then today's university students lack the spirit of inquiry the most. If primary school students don't understand something, they will often persistently ask teachers and parents. Middle school students don't ask so much. As for university students, they consider it shameful to ask others, so they simply ignore what is going on. For example, in class, primary school students are truly in class listening to lectures, middle school students are mostly absent-minded, their bodies are in the classroom, but their minds are outside the school. As for university students, they simply don't go to class. If all the university students are present in class, with no one absent, that would be a complete novelty. As a rule, they are scattered, late and leaving early. So some people say that primary school students truly read books, middle school students pretend to read books, and university students don't read books. In fact, university students have too many things to care about. They have to participate in political organizations, engage in social movements, and in addition, love, watching dramas, and dancing are also important programs in daily life. How can they manage to be so busy? Therefore, if you ask today's students and young people about famous events or figures in Chinese history, they will often be confused and give irrelevant answers, but if you talk about movies and stars, they will be familiar with their stories and characters, and regard famous male and female stars as objects of worship and faith. The pictures pasted on the walls, placed on the desks, and clipped in the books are all pictures of stars. When stars arrive, the city is empty, and most of them are male and female students. I really don't know what kind of education this is! But now those above are advocating it, and those below are following it. Important people support stars, using special cars for welcome and farewell, and personally hosting them. As a result, the whole country follows the trend, and the remaining influence is just beginning.</p>

<h3>Fifth Air Defense Day Conducts Evacuation Training; Air Defense Headquarters Announces Matters of Citizen Responsibility</h3>
<p>The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters authorities issued the following statement on the fifth Air Defense Day on the 9th of this month:</p>
<p>The air defense training planned for the fifth Air Defense Day will focus on evacuation and seeking shelter. These two aspects are considered passive air defense measures. Citizens often consider them unimportant and neglect them. They know to work hard on fire prevention and rescue, and the results are obvious. As a result, the training in evacuation and seeking shelter is far behind what is expected. They don't know that during an air raid, if evacuation and seeking shelter can be planned perfectly and carried out thoroughly, it can reduce the workload of firefighters and rescue personnel and make it easier for them to cope. Therefore, each protection group should consider the scope of danger in a time of crisis, open as many air raid shelters as possible, set up as many evacuation and seeking shelter places as possible, and practice diligently at all times so that when an incident occurs, they are already skilled and can cope easily. The selection of instructors should be given special attention, as these supervisors must be able to lead the masses so that they can maintain order and not do whatever they want, even when they are afraid and disoriented. We sincerely hope that citizens will plan in advance and implement the three training items of "pre-evacuation," "emergency evacuation," and "preparing to hide" on the fifth Air Defense Day.</p>
<p>On-site Observation</p>
<p>Secondly, in order to give each protection group the opportunity to learn from each other, on-site inspections of the training exercises will be conducted on the fifth Air Defense Day. The number of participants in the exercises should be in accordance with the pre-arranged plan, and they should deal with everything in the spirit of encountering an air raid, so that they are skilled, courageous, and agile, and the observers can know it at a glance. Those watching the exercises should also pay attention to the movements of the performers with a learning attitude, so as to learn from them and help improve themselves. After the meeting, the learners will propose the material studied as information for research and improvement. Therefore, when conducting on-site inspections, it is imperative to refrain from smoking, talking and laughing loudly, or standing by with folded arms.</p>
<p>On the fifth Air Defense Day, evacuation and rescue exercises will be conducted in schools of China and Japan. Instructors and rescue personnel have already started training classes, and it is hoped that within a reasonable amount of time, the trainees will take on the role of instructors for evacuation and rescue.</p>
<p>Regarding strengthening the organization of special protection groups, this headquarters has repeatedly mentioned it. On the fifth Air Defense Day, in addition to the training of ordinary protection groups, personnel from the Army and Navy Air Defense Command Headquarters, bookstores, and the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters will go to various high-rise buildings and factories for inspections in order to conduct exercises. All those within the scope of the group should strive to arrange everything so that there is no regret.</p>
<p>Blackout</p>
<p>A blackout will also be implemented on this day. Those responsible for directing and controlling the lights must be able to shorten the time from issuing the order to completing the task. It would be even better to record and save the time taken to complete the blackout for future reference.</p>
<p>The inspection of air defense equipment is also very important. It is regrettable that some citizens have been injured while participating in air defense exercises recently. Those who are in charge of guiding the training must inspect all necessary equipment one by one before the exercise is held, so that the participants will not be injured due to oversight. Special attention is requested for this pre-inspection.</p>
<h3>Central Naval Academy Holds Third Graduation Ceremony: Naval Minister Speaks on Behalf of Chairman</h3>
<p>The Central Naval Academy held its third officer student graduation ceremony at the academy on Lunghua Road on the 6th. High-ranking officials and guests gathered together for a solemn ceremony. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>High-Ranking Officials and Guests</p>
<p>Attendees included: Rear Admiral Chikazane, Naval Attaché from allied Japan; Rear Admiral Maeda, Chief Naval Advisor; Rear Admiral Mori, Chief Instructor; Major Teshima; Instructor Kida; Minister Saemi; from the Chinese side, in addition to President Jiang of the academy and all faculty members, high-ranking officials and guests present included: Naval Minister Ren Yuan, representing Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek; Director Wu, representing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Zhao Zhengping, Xiong Lian Dong, Huang Jingzhai, Xu Liqiu, Chen Bin He, and over 300 others.</p>
<p>Grand Ceremony</p>
<p>At exactly 10:00 AM, after the ceremony began, President Jiang first reported on the issuing of graduation diplomas and awards from the Chairman. After the awards and certificates from Naval Minister Ren, Army Minister Ye, and the President were given, Naval Minister Ren, representing the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, gave a speech. Chief Advisor Maeda, President Jiang, and Chief Instructor Mori followed with speeches. Subsequently, guest Zhao Zhengping delivered a speech, followed by the reading of congratulatory telegrams from various parties. Finally, Ma Qingpo, a graduate of the academy, delivered a response on behalf of all students. The ceremony concluded with the entire assembly singing the Naval Anthem and the Academy Anthem.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>China's revival depends on nurturing naval talent. The Central Naval Academy was established with this intention, as the Navy Department's sole school for nurturing naval talent. Students, with your outstanding qualifications, were selected to enter the school. After three years of rigorous training, you hold your graduation ceremony today, dignified and full of spirit, which is truly gratifying. However, the training of naval commanders requires stringent conditions. After graduation, practical training on warships is a necessary process. During the internship, students should draw upon school discussions and personally experience practical work. The most important point remains adhering to military discipline. Military discipline encompasses a wide range of cultivation. If students can practice it diligently, then no matter how important, how trivial, or how difficult the work, they will be able to handle it with ease. In peacetime, you will be able to lead subordinates, and in wartime, you will be able to defeat the enemy. Even in academic research, if you can embody the essence of discipline, you will be diligent in your studies. In short, naval officers must possess profound knowledge and, more importantly, a rigorous spirit. Having undergone training at the academy and practical training on warships to nurture profound knowledge, I further hope that you can understand military discipline to cultivate a rigorous spirit. I, as Chairman, have high expectations of you.</p>
<p>Advisor Maeda's Address</p>
<p>Today, as the Central Naval Academy holds its third student graduation ceremony, it is my honor to participate, and I am truly delighted. Recalling your time as naval students at this academy, it has been three years since you entered. Under the tutelage and education of the President and instructors, you have dedicated yourselves to learning and constantly striving forward. To have achieved the honor of graduating today is truly cause for celebration. The rise and fall of the navy directly affects the strength of a nation. To make a country strong and equal to the world powers, the navy must be strengthened first, and control of the sea must be secured. The nascent Chinese navy has laid the foundation for a unified national navy through the extraordinary efforts of your predecessors and is advancing rapidly. Its further development and ultimate success rests on your shoulders. Now, as we face extraordinary times of war, your paths are numerous and far-reaching, immeasurable. Therefore, your responsibilities can be said to be heavy and great. Therefore, you must apply the military spirit and academic skills cultivated during your studies to practical work, striving diligently to complete your duties. At the same time, you must constantly refine and study, using your personal achievements to contribute to the navy's success, and only then can you become pillars of the nation. Now, as the war situation expands, military personnel, in particular, must not be constrained by their own interests or seek momentary comfort. You must thoroughly understand the situation, be cautious in peacetime, and fight bravely on the battlefield. You must pursue your mission with the ambition to sacrifice the individual for the greater good, fulfilling the duties of a soldier and achieving the great task of defending the nation. As you embark on your journey to the front lines, I wish you all the best and encourage you to constantly strive forward. This is my simple congratulatory message.</p>
<p>President's Remarks</p>
<p>At a time when the flames of the Pacific War are raging, our third class of twenty-five students from the Central Naval Academy, under the banner of the new navy, have completed three years of continuous, intensive training as planned. Today, we hold this graduation ceremony, and we are deeply grateful and honored to have so many high-ranking officials and guests present to give us guidance. As these third-class students prepare to join the ranks of the new navy, we feel joy on the one hand, and on the other hand, we feel that this is a major turning point. Therefore, at this critical juncture, we cannot help but offer a few more words of caution, focusing on what is needed: Learning has no end. The third-class students must redouble their efforts and be more vigilant to avoid the shortcomings caused by complacency. Skill comes from practice. As the saying goes, "Accumulating good deeds creates good fortune; do not neglect small good deeds. Accumulating evil deeds brings disaster; do not commit small evils." "Unripe grains are worse than weeds; imperfect benevolence is worse than recklessness." Only with well-honed skills can you apply them; only with practiced application can you achieve victory. The way to mastery is to exert a hundred times more effort than others or a thousand times more effort than others. "Thinking, thinking, the ghosts and spirits will assist you" is the key to solving all difficult problems. Command ability is built upon obedience experience. Serving as a bridge between superiors and subordinates should be your primary task in the future. The strength of a group lies in organization, coordination, and unity, as well as the strength and vigor of each individual unit. Promote the effectiveness of the academy. Those who take the initiative must have self-control; those who are self-confident must have self-knowledge. The lotus flower grows from the mud, and the beautiful jade is formed through polishing. The more difficult the environment, the more passionate the ambition. As the saying goes, "Stir the heart, temper the nature, and increase what one is capable of." By establishing precedents, they can then serve as examples. Warming up the past with new knowledge can be an instructive teacher. The third-class students who have completed their final lesson and graduation ceremony today are our academy's guarantee for the future of the new navy. Therefore the subsequent classes should not complain about their surroundings but take responsibility for them. Everything that goes wrong should be appreciated, and should be energized to pioneer the new environment and the new world of the emerging career field, with a consistent spirit of aspiration and physical constitution. After training the emerging cadre qualifications, the third-class students should also pay their respects to the supreme leader, pay respects to the Naval Minister and other officials, pay respects to the academy's guidance department and all officers and officials with true career sincerity. At the same time, the country, the nation, and the future of East Asia place boundless expectations on this group of young and bright thirty-five future star officers.</p>
<p>Student Response</p>
<p>Today is the graduation ceremony of the third class of the Central Naval Academy. Naval Minister Ren, representing the Chairman, as well as Chief Advisor Maeda and all the officials and guests, have graced us with their presence and given us guidance. This is the supreme honor for all of us in the third class. We students pay our respects to the guests and vow that we will all work hard together, never giving up due to difficulties or becoming complacent due to minor achievements. We are determined to follow the teachings, muster great courage, make great resolutions, and strive for self-improvement and excellence, in order to contribute everything to the new development of the Navy and the victory of the Greater East Asia War. We are filled with gratitude and await our orders.</p>
<h3>Measures for Fundraising to Subsidize Living Expenses of Elementary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>The salaries of teachers and staff in municipal elementary and secondary schools in this city are meager and insufficient to sustain their livelihoods. Yesterday, Mayor Chen and Minister Ding Canghui invited representatives from all sectors of society to discuss subsidy measures and decided on several principles. The methods for donating to subsidize the living expenses of teachers and staff in public and private elementary and secondary schools in this city are as follows:</p>
<p>Donation Methods</p>
<p>Measures for Donating to Subsidize Living Expenses of Teachers and Staff in Public and Private Elementary and Secondary Schools in Shanghai:</p>
<p>The various sectors of Shanghai, in order to help teachers and staff in Shanghai's public and private elementary and secondary schools, improve their treatment, and improve their lives, have jointly decided on these measures.</p>
<p>All public and private elementary schools in Shanghai with tuition fees of less than one thousand yuan per semester, and secondary schools with tuition fees of less than one thousand five hundred yuan per semester, may collect donations from students' parents according to these measures.</p>
<p>The aforementioned donations will be collected monthly in four amounts: twenty yuan, thirty yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan. Students' parents may choose the amount according to their financial situation. Those who can donate more are welcome.</p>
<p>The aforementioned donations will be collected starting in May of the 33rd year, but to save on procedures, donations for three months may be collected at once. The first collection, for the months of May, June, and July, is scheduled for May.</p>
<p>All donations will be submitted by students' parents to the school their children attend. Each school should deposit the funds in a bank (designated by the Municipal Bureau of Education). The funds may not be withdrawn without the approval of the Municipal Bureau of Education.</p>
<p>All donation receipts will be printed by the Municipal Bureau of Education with serialized numbers and affixed with the bureau's seal. The receipts will be distributed to the schools. When collecting donations, the principal and the person collecting the donations should sign and affix their seals.</p>
<p>After each round of donations, each school should post a list of donors within the school and prepare a clear list, along with the receipt stubs, to be submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Education. ○ The donations collected by each school according to these methods should be used to subsidize the living expenses of the school's teachers and staff in principle. However, schools with higher donation revenues may use part of their excess funds to help schools with lower donation revenues. The method of allocating these funds will be separately determined by the Bureau of Education.</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education should prepare a report on the donations received by each school in each round and the allocation of funds, and make it public.</p>
<p>Students' parents who donate more than the amount stipulated by these methods will have their donations reported by the school principals to the Municipal Bureau of Education for commendation. Those whose monthly donations exceed ten thousand yuan should be reported to the Municipal Government for public praise.</p>
<p>School principals or teachers and staff who perform outstandingly in handling donation matters will be rewarded by the Municipal Bureau of Education.</p>
<p>Parents who are not students of elementary or secondary schools but are concerned about education and frequently provide subsidies to teachers and staff in elementary and secondary schools are encouraged to submit their donations to the major [unclear characters] in this city. The major newspapers should announce these donations promptly and submit them to the Municipal Bureau of Education monthly for unified allocation. The methods for rewarding and praising these donors will be implemented in accordance with the provisions of item ten.</p>
<p>The major newspapers in this city should collect donations for the living expenses of teachers and staff in elementary and secondary schools on behalf of the public, announce them promptly, and submit them to the Municipal Bureau of Education monthly for unified allocation.</p>
<p>Teachers and staff in elementary and secondary schools in this city may, with the approval of the Municipal Bureau of Education and the Bureau of Social Welfare, jointly organize a welfare association to improve their living conditions through their own efforts and promote continued support from all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Our Newspaper's Collection</p>
<p>Based on our compassionate heart, this newspaper is willing to do its utmost to appeal to all sectors of society, with a goal of one million yuan. The reports of collections will be published once every other day and will conclude within two weeks. In addition to the 50,000 yuan donated by this newspaper, yesterday we also received a generous donation of 50,000 yuan from Mr. Luo Hongyi, and 20,000 yuan each from Mr. Ding Boxiong, Zheng Fangxi, Xu Changchun, and Zhang Ruitang, and 10,000 yuan each from Mr. Gu Nanqun, Chen Riping, Xiang Kangyuan, and Chen Bin Chi.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>A Plea for Elementary and Secondary School Teachers</h3>
<p>In the editorial on the fourth day of this month, our newspaper discussed "Improving the Treatment of Elementary and Secondary School Teachers." We believe that education is a fundamental plan for cultivating talents for a hundred years, and teachers are the driving force for advancing education. Whether teachers' treatment is appropriate is directly proportional to the quality of educational effectiveness. Therefore, we advocate for a thorough improvement of teachers' lives, striving to ensure a minimum level of stability. In particular, the number of elementary and secondary school teachers is more widespread, and the government should find ways to provide subsidies. On the afternoon of the fifth, Mayor Chen and Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare held a tea party to invite representatives from all sectors of society to discuss this matter and decided on several measures.</p>
<p>Our newspaper is making every effort to support this matter and intends to raise donations from all sectors of society. It is assumed that one hundred groups are targeted, with each person taking on one or more groups, and each group donating 2,000 yuan per month. Those who pay in full for six months at once will be accepted. After six months, the Municipal Government will have a solution for education funding. During this transition period, we sincerely hope that warm-hearted people will jointly support us. Yesterday, Mr. Luo Hongyi and others took the lead in advocating for donations, and in one day, over 220,000 yuan was raised. Their enthusiasm is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Recently, our newspaper has been making every effort to promote social welfare undertakings, hoping to follow in the footsteps of people from all sectors of society and promote them together. However, anything related to public welfare must involve donations. Donors may not mind, but those soliciting donations feel uneasy. Considering the social situation, there are too many gaps that need to be gradually filled. Therefore, we do not hesitate to be tedious, disregard public praise, and do what we believe is right. However, our role is to emphasize promotion, and after receiving social donations, how to make good use of them and live up to social expectations is a matter that we hope those involved in various public welfare undertakings will take seriously. At the same time, we will also fulfill our responsibility to supervise from the sidelines. Briefly touching on what we feel, we also discuss it here.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Attending the Tea Party</h3>
<p>— Yang Jinzhao</p>
<p>Mayor Chen and Minister Ding held a tea party to discuss raising the salaries of elementary and secondary school teachers and staff. As the principal of a municipal elementary school, I attended the tea party and had many thoughts after listening to everyone's insightful remarks.</p>
<p>First, the treatment of teachers in municipal schools is worse than that in private schools. This is an undeniable fact. Before the salary increase, the following three phenomena occurred: Excellent teachers abandoned their profession and changed careers. Those who remained were not content with their positions. Those who are known to slack off are also in the teaching profession as samples of the [unclear] transition era. As soon as there is another job, they abandon it. The hiring of senior class teachers is more difficult than ascending to heaven. Now it is not about poor teachers, low student levels, etc., but what to do when good teachers leave? The crisis in the education sector has long been lurking due to low salaries, and it is even worse now. At present, the principle of subsidizing the living expenses of teachers and staff from May to the summer vacation has finally been determined. But we must not forget that in addition to teachers and staff, there are also school workers, who are also laborers in the education sector. The monthly salary of municipal school workers is only 426 yuan, which is far from enough to make them feel full and satisfied.</p>
<p>Secondly, the principals of municipal schools jointly requested that the municipal government increase the salaries of employees to 4,500 yuan per month per person. The municipal treasury is struggling, and this is just wishful thinking. It remains to be seen whether the municipal finance can be adjusted in the second half of the year and education funding can be reasonably increased. Assuming that salaries are increased by 2,000 yuan per month, parents should empathize with the plight of teachers and make monthly donations this semester. Taking our school as an example, there are a total of twelve grades, twenty teachers, and five school workers. Because the school is located in Shanghai Fourth District, most of the students' families are poor. More than 600 students donating 30 yuan per month each would raise about 20,000 yuan, which is still 30,000 yuan short. There are others whose economic situation is worse than ours. According to Director Lin's report at the tea party, there are 1,500 municipal school teachers, so 3 million yuan would be needed, but at least 1.5 million yuan would be missing. Including private schools, the shortfall will exceed 5 million yuan by the end of July. It is impossible to solve the problem without the warm-hearted assistance of students' parents and all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu said: "To do things well, you need a combination of system, personnel, and funding," and the focus of these three is still funding. For example, education funding: Before the war, public schools in Shanghai had better treatment than those in the interior. In recent years, the education sector, especially municipal schools, has been declining. Lack of funding and poor treatment are the main reasons. A year or two ago, a banquet donation expanded the collection of special consumption taxes. Before the special consumption tax, how the collected donations were spent is something we hope the financial authorities will announce. If it has not been diverted, we expect it to be used for the temporary improvement of elementary and secondary schools this time.</p>
<p>I myself admit that there are indeed many people in the education sector who are determined to work hard with the spirit of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" However, many comrades have been devastated by life and have become depressed. They are in a semi-idle state, leaving a bad influence. However, that is wrong! After attending this tea party, I felt the keen expectations of society for us. Everyone has great sympathy for the painful lives of the educators. The establishment of scholarship funds by various newspapers has had a particularly significant impact on our morale. As someone in charge of school administration, representing a unit, I express my gratitude to all concerned parties and am willing to dedicate myself to the education cause. Educators, rise up and move forward, and make efforts in your own positions! I wish a bright future for Shanghai education!</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Promoting Scientific Research</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Chuan Qizhao</p>
<p>The greatest tragedy of our nation's politics is excessive wastefulness. The administrative structure is vast and cumbersome, with too many superfluous branches, leading to a lack of unified goals and steps. The result is fragmented governance and no tangible achievements. Moreover, everything is done perfunctorily without seeking thoroughness. If we want to promote scientific research, the government must have clear goals, comprehensive plans, rigorous standards, and unwavering commitment. It must spare no expense to promote scientific progress. In my humble opinion, the most effective and rapid ways to achieve this are as follows:</p>
<p>Improving the Education System: The deficiencies of our country's education system are well-known. We must urgently improve our education system, emulating countries like Japan and Germany, and establish comprehensive higher technical and industrial schools. This will enable students with lower aptitude to acquire specialized skills and serve the country, while those with higher aptitude can advance to universities for more in-depth research. This system can cultivate technical personnel and leaders in the scientific community, and actively develop industry. The state must also provide graduates of higher education institutions with convenient career paths, such as in agriculture and ceramics, so that people are not deterred from pursuing them.</p>
<p>Strictly Regulating University Curricula: The responsibilities of a Chinese university student are actually greater than those of a British Member of Parliament. Therefore, university students must undergo the most rigorous training. Establish practical industrial universities, like MIT in the United States. Within universities, strive to ensure the stability of professors' lives, so they can concentrate on research, and urgently eliminate those who are merely filling positions. Provide students with ample facilities for research. Each national university should specialize in specific courses to attract students, allowing them to choose and avoid wasting time.</p>
<p>Expanding School Experimentation: Experimentation is the mother of science. A most pitiful phenomenon in today's Chinese universities is the lack of experimentation. Natural sciences without experimentation are equivalent to not studying at all. Although there is a shortage of materials, and chemical reagents are often used for military purposes, the government must maintain experimental work in all schools, no matter what. Universities in Shanghai are all mired in the tragic state of suspended experimentation, and the government should make every effort to provide relief.</p>
<p>Promoting Public Interest in Science: Establish more public lectures and open experiments to generate public interest in science and encourage practical applications.</p>
<p>Establish National Research Institutes: Such as the Academia Sinica, to amass books, publish journals, collect materials, establish standardized measurements, and recruit advanced researchers. At the same time, provide various economic and academic assistance to private research with achievements. Establish national annual awards to encourage researchers' discoveries, and reward powerful social organizations and industrial and commercial organizations for establishing small-scale laboratories to support the research work of their employees.</p>
<p>National Construction Projects: Instruct researchers to focus on research or hire foreign consultants, but do not allow foreigners to operate projects on their behalf.</p>
<p>Strictly Inspect the Products of Chemical Factories, Pharmaceutical Factories, and Instrument Factories: Ensure that they meet standards, and prevent the public from losing faith in domestic goods.</p>
<p>Sending Experts to Study Abroad: Must have specific objectives, and be able to make contributions after returning to the country, otherwise it is a waste of resources.</p>
<p>Formulate Plans: Like the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, a certain number of factories and research institutes must be established within a specified period, such as sulfuric acid plants, pigment factories, and gold ingot research institutes.</p>
<p>Pay Handsomely to Hire Foreigners as Instructors: For the most basic machinery, such as steam engines for trains and internal combustion engines for automobiles, we must strive to manufacture them ourselves.</p>
<p>The government must put forward the central ideology of "talent supremacy, production supremacy." Under this ideology, students, researchers, and professors should move forward courageously. While the progress of foreign countries should be introduced, the progress of our own country should be even more publicized to give people full confidence.</p>
<p>Make every effort to protect new industries that are scientific and industrialized, and gradually improve old-fashioned handicrafts to make them scientific.</p>

<h3>Navy Iwata Toyoo Zen Hong</h3>
<p>— Ocean Translation</p>
<p>To go to Tokyo, I deliberately took a detour on the Nippon Main Line train to avoid, in any case, sitting on the same train as Masato, who was returning to school. Takao took a boat from Beppu to Osaka, and then boarded a train marked "To Tokyo" for the first time.</p>
<p>When he arrived at Tokyo Station, he had a little more than three hundred yuan left in his pocket. He stayed at a hotel in the Hongo district, advertised in the travel guide with one-and-a-half yuan per night in the largest font. The next day, he ran to an art school in the Ueno area to request admission, but was turned away because it was not the enrollment period and because he had not graduated from middle school.</p>
<p>(Damn it!)</p>
<p>Takao thought that not entering a national art school was not a big deal. He believed that Tokyo was big. There must be countless private schools on par with national art schools. As a result, he found the attractive name of "Tokyo Fine Arts Graduate School" in the newspaper advertisement column.</p>
<p>Tokyo Fine Arts Graduate School was located in a remote alley, Teramachi Street, in the Yanaka district. It was a school with neither a school gate nor a school building. Of course, it was not completely devoid of everything like the Shoka Sonjuku, so it should not be underestimated. It was a two-story rectangular building, and there was the sound of a baby crying behind the lattice door, which was a truly unique school.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, may I come in?"</p>
<p>Takao tried to speak standard Mandarin.</p>
<p>First, a lady holding a baby came out, and then a master with a beard and wearing a wide coat came out.</p>
<p>"We don't teach directly."</p>
<p>He looked at Takao carefully and said, "Then why is it in the advertisement..."</p>
<p>"Although it is in the advertisement, classes will only start when there are enough students. At the same time, people who receive special direct teaching, according to our regulations, must first read the lectures and acquire basic knowledge..."</p>
<p>It turned out that Tokyo Fine Arts Graduate School was a place that published picture lectures. In the end, Takao had no choice but to buy a year's worth of lectures, tied them with thick rope, and took them back to the hotel in Hongo. Buying lectures, of course, cost him more than twenty yuan, just like everyone else. However, when he looked at the content of the lectures, it turned out that it was all gibberish arranged in type, which was actually to be expected.</p>
<p>However, Takao was not discouraged by this.</p>
<p>(Damn it!)</p>
<p>The next day, he strolled around again to find a new art school. Tokyo's famous scenic spots, movies, tea houses, etc., did not attract his attention. He was single-mindedly thinking about becoming a painter. Deep in his heart, he could not settle down unless he started learning to become a painter as soon as possible.</p>
<p>A few days later, he gradually realized the true face of Tokyo, such a vast and mysterious metropolis.</p>

<h3>Using Nature to Restore Children's Health: Reading and Resting</h3>
<p>The problem of child rearing in our country is not given enough attention. Most families do not understand the personality and physical condition of their children in detail. Furthermore, due to the differences in environment and habits, school education is unable to provide differentiated facilities. As a result, the physical and mental health of children is greatly affected. If there are weak lungs, tuberculosis, adenoiditis (pulmonary hilar lymphadenitis or cervical lymphadenitis), bone tuberculosis, anemia, rickets, paralysis, and nervous abnormalities, and if the treatment is not proper, it is very dangerous! If the physical and mental conditions are not considered, and they still enter ordinary primary and secondary schools, then irregular living and heavy schoolwork will lead to aggravation of the disease and damage their lives. If they drop out of school and go to an ordinary hospital for treatment, they will be confined to bed for a long time, wasting their time and missing the opportunity to learn. In all developed countries in the world, there are facilities for open-air schools and forest schools, so that weak children can receive special education in a natural environment. They can cultivate their bodies, increase their knowledge, and take care of both rest and learning. This is a good method to learn from. Therefore, if we can imitate the methods of open-air schools and forest schools in places with elegant scenery, lush trees, fresh air, and plenty of sunshine, and have medical facilities, so that they can rest and study at the same time, and take extra care, it is hoped that weak children can turn from weak to strong, and from ignorant to wise, and gradually restore their physical and mental health through the cultivation of nature. Today, if we have a healthy child, we will have a healthy adult in the future, which is not only about the welfare of a small number of children, but also about the welfare of the entire nation. I hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will come together to support it. (Yang Wenguo)</p>
<h3>Gathering of Elders Initiates Retirement Home</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the fifth of this month, the elders of the Qiying Association gathered at the Foguang Nursing Home on Lantian Road and initiated the organization of a retirement home in a secluded place with beautiful scenery as a place for rest. The public opinion was the same. Preparations are now underway.</p>
<h3>Stolen Sewing Machines: School Unable to Continue Opening</h3>
<p>The original purpose of establishing our school was to cultivate women who love to learn sewing and to provide them with practical opportunities. Unexpectedly, after only two terms, the three sewing machine heads that were placed were stolen in the middle of last month, so that we could not continue to enroll students this year, which is a pity. Although we have been investigating in all directions, there is no clue, and we are extremely anxious. I thought that this was just a rumour, probably because we are investigating, so it has not been sold yet. Now I will let you know that I am not willing to accept it, and I will move it to the scholarship fund to benefit the people. Sincerely, Weijia Stocking Sewing School, No. 638, Alley 4, Changle Road. (Phone 78834)</p>
