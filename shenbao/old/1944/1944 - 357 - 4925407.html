<h3>八十六屆議會席上日陸海相報告戰況</h3>
<p>陸相報吿</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日杉山陸相於議會報吿戰况要旨如次，茲報吿上次議會以後之陸軍戰况如次：</p>
<p>培摩兩島</p>
<p>第一，就太平洋方面敵軍以「馬里亞納」爲對日進攻前進基地，九月十五日，於「培里琉」島及「摩羅泰」島强行登陸，當地日陸海軍勇躍逖擊，摩羅泰方面之勇士，在敵登陸以來，約三月餘，利用困難之地形與叢林，活躍肉搏，展開突擊血戰。同時，日陸軍機隊亦對之連續猛襲，敵登陸軍的一師受重創，敵苦心建設之機塲八處，大半皆被毀壞。培里琉鳥之日軍，以寡兵堅忍不撓的情神，對敵的三師作長期之反復肉搏，迄今敵已損傷二萬以上，依此可防害敵利用該基地，此兩方面之勇鬥，對於菲律賓作戰貢獻皆大。</p>
<p>緬印方面</p>
<p>第二，「緬甸」方面日軍，自五月中旬以來之數月間，使數十倍之敵軍遭受大打擊後，自九月全員壯烈陣亡，其勇戰力鬥之情形，徵諸斃敵約三萬五千人之大戰果，當可愈像。龍陵附近之日軍，九月下旬以來，展開新攻勢，急於打開未多公路之敵軍，受甚大之妨碍，「北緬」戰綫，日軍對怒江西方地區之渝雲南遠征軍相互呼應而企圖南下之渝美軍，發動先發攻擊，屢次整理陣勢，猛勇前進中。又日陸軍機隊與陸地部隊，邀擊來襲之敵機，十月一日至十二月十五日，擊落擊毀其一百八十八架。又印度洋海面，亦有英艦隊蠢動之兆，十月二十日敵機動部隊蠢動於尼科巴島，然遭日軍機隊勇敢之拼撞攻擊，立即遁走。</p>
<p>本土防禦</p>
<p>第三。滿洲及北方方面，滿洲及本土北邊之陸軍，於酷寒下一心一意履行任務，所防衛安如磐石。又滿洲之重工業地帶，時有渝美空軍之空襲，而日軍則隨時與滿洲國軍緊密協助而邀擊。第四·關於本土防禦方面，以中國大睦及馬里亞納爲基地之美空軍，屢决來襲，多以日本本土之東京·北九州·名古屋方面爲主，其目的在謀後方生產之破壞，或以無差別的轟炸，期後方民心之動搖，今後其來襲必更激烈，日本睦海軍航空部隊及陸地部隊，每遇敵機來襲，立即果敢邀擊，至今已予相當創傷。同時，更進而長驅空襲成都，馬里亞納等敵基地，予以重創。</p>
<p>大陸戰綫</p>
<p>第五·「中國戰綫」方面，自本年四月二十日開始以來，至今已歷八閱月，冒盛暑越艱險進攻，相繼攻略洛陽·衡陽·桂林·南寗等要衝，踏破路程達一千六百公里，至此，敵軍歷兩年在中國西南所建主要空軍基地，幾全覆減。本月十日，這大陸縱斷路之大陸方面之有利態勢，更加强化，其間敵方損失，除空軍基地之崩潰外，並收容屍體及俘虜約二十五萬，砲約一千二百門，尤其空戰極爲激烈，自本年四月至十二月十日，在大陸擊落敵機的近四百架，擊毀已逾一千四百架，而獲得此大戰果，日軍航空部隊之辛苦，實有筆紙難罄之處。此次作戰所與渝方及渝美空軍之打擊極大，蔣介石與英美之焦慮，實難遮蓋。</p>
<p>菲島方面</p>
<p>第六，菲律賓方面，自十月十二日以來，美軍機動部隊雖在台灣及菲律賓之海面空戰，遭遇痛烈大打擊，但於十月十七日，復以大運輸船團侵入菲律賓雷伊泰灣而登陸，目下戰况推移，敵以佔據雷伊泰島東岸平地爲主，日軍確保西方高聳之脊梁，山脈，以寡兵到處攻擊敵七師之衆，戰况一進一退，極爲錯綜。繼壯烈之「黨」空挺滕之突擊，於十二月夜，又高千穗降落傘部隊，在敵機塲作降落攻擊，同時，陸地部隊亦行突入，另佔領升北布羅音機堪，聖巴布羅機塲，予敵空軍基地重大打擎，敵更增加兵力，强在雷伊泰西岸阿爾別拉附近登陸，本月二日遂突入奧爾莫克市，十五日更在明多羅一角登陸。</p>
<p>空軍戰果</p>
<p>目下菲律賓戰局已自雷伊泰島擴大至比塞亞兩區，展開最激烈之戰鬥，尤其空戰，乃日軍有史以來之激戰，或進攻，或邀擊，或轟擊敵艦船，其激烈程度，難以言語形容，尤其日陸軍特別攻擊隊各隊之忠烈，與海軍神風特別攻擊隊共同實行衝撞，使敵心膽寒，搜索此等敵艦船，期必死必中。從事拚撞者，全爲二十歲前後之靑年軍人，其盡忠報國之至誠，不禁令人感激。此等陸軍特攻隊，在十一月十二日至十二月二十二日之間，所獲戰果，僅經確認者，即轟沉擊沉敵艦船四十九艘，內有戰艦五艘，運輸船三十二艘。又擊毀或起火三十八艘，內有大型空母一艘，運輸船二十七艘及其他，總計八十七艘之多。今敵機動部隊及運輸船團已受重創。又我陸軍航空部隊攻擊雷伊泰灣內及其他菲律賓近海之敵艦船，所收戰果，除前述特攻隊者外，於十月十八日至十二月二十二日之間，計轟沉擊沉敵艦船三十二艘，擊毀幷起火焚燒者九十一艘，總計一百二十三艘，此外，擊落敵機僅陸軍方面者，達六百六十二架。</p>
<p>渾然一體</p>
<p>敵美當局雖依恃物量，然尤督促國民奮起，謂以今之消耗狀態觀之，美，超人之努力，則前綫補給况進一言，即敵美內心頗亞戰爭者，即達五十萬零，美軍當局對人力損失之發表，完全矛盾，可知實際死傷數額極大，然敵美軍雖蒙以上重創，而其戰意更不可轉侮，且極欲冒一切困難，爭取此次菲律賓決戰之勝利，戰局前途固屬重大，而我陸軍亦正攻擊來犯之敵軍，以完遂該方面之作戰。此時惟特攻隊之拚撞精神，方能擊滅宿敵使失戰意，我特攻隊之拚撞，實爲我國體三千年來之精華，亦即一億國民憤激之凝結與皇軍精強無比之表現，我陸軍上下一致團結，與海軍渾然一體，不問前綫或後方，全國將兵悉以特攻隊與挺身隊之精神爲精神，誓滅宿敵，以安聖慮。</p>
<p>海相報告</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日米內海相，二十七日於日本議會席上報吿戰况如次：茲就前議會以後帝國海軍戰况之槪要加以說明，並披瀝所信之端，關於戰况，每次均已由大本營發表，</p>
<p>主要戰鬥集中菲島</p>
<p>前議會以來，迄今約三個半月間，戰鬥主要集中於菲律賓方面，敵軍强擬奪回，日方則力加保衛，刻正繼續激戰中。由七月至九月，奪取馬里亞納方面基地之尼米資艦隊及由新幾內亞方面北進之麥克沃塞部隊，兩相呼應，而露呈積極侵寇菲律賓之企圖，敵軍由九月上旬至中旬，首以飛機屢决來襲菲律賓，企圖消耗該地日方航空兵力，作爲奪回菲律賓之基地，而於培里琉，安格維爾及摩羅泰各島登陸。繼之敵軍更攻擊菲律賓方面日軍補給路之西南羣島及合灣，因而鍬起台灣海面空戰，繼之敵機動部隊以其有力空軍來襲台灣，因此日陸海軍航空部隊由十月十二日至十六日，晝夜連續果敢反覆攻擊敵機動部隊，擊沉其航空母艦十一艘，戰艦二艘，將之擊退。繼此機動部隊行動之後，集結於新幾內亞方面之麥克沃塞部隊，十月十七日終行侵入菲律賓雷伊泰灣，十九日於雷伊泰島登陸，敵軍於此登陸作戰，雖受重創，却得遂决擴大其地盤，於殘有機動部隊掩護之下，增强登陸兵力。</p>
<p>海軍全力澈底擊敵</p>
<p>日聯合艦隊爲追擊此等敵機動部隊，集中航空兵力，水上部隊及潛艇之全力，予敵全軍以澈底之攻擊，特別於十月二十四日至二十六日之間，菲律賓海面海戰時，收獲擊沉敵航空母艦八艘，巡洋艦四艘之戰果，此間日方亦有若干損失。台灣海面空戰，菲律賓海面海戰等，由於日軍之相繼攻擊，竟獲覆滅敵軍對日反攻作戰主力之航空母艦大半之戰果。其後以雷伊泰鳥爲中心之菲律賓作戰，逐次激烈，第一線之飛機消耗戰允甚，故演成可能以補給我多寡，左右戰局之勝負。當此時期，神風特別攻擊隊體盡忠報國之大義，發揚必死攻擊精神，鼓舞前綫日軍士氣，敵軍爲阻止日軍前綫飛機之補給，遂擾亂攻擊日軍後方，進而更加緊空襲本土之飛機生產地帶。於前議會時，曾強調日言之現代作戰，不問海陸之別，獲得制空權，乃爲現代作戰上之最要者，故切望國民協力，以期多向前綫增援飛機。</p>
<p>飛機增產日益加緊</p>
<p>現在日方飛機增產之經過，由於各方面關係者之協力扶助，爲應嚴重戰局之要求，日益加緊，故日軍得以確保菲律賓方面之制空權，有時更且有與敵成伯仲之勢，最近或有陷於敵手之情狀，如敵軍進入蘇魯海，卒於十二月二十五日，於明多羅島登陸，此乃憾事。菲律賓於日軍作戰上所居地位，諒各位均所熟悉，務必死守到底，自不待言，此時吾人不宜拘泥於局部職况之消長，當於不移之信念下，急迅打開現下之局面，爲今之計，惟望能藉神機之力，轉成攻勢，最終以菲律賓方面爲決戰塲，乘該方日軍戰略上之利點，衝破敵軍最感痛苦之弱點，用以獲得最後勝利。因此，一億國民均應以特別攻擊之精神，不屈不撓，克服所有困難，舉國力之一切，急速使之戰力化，將之投於決戰場中，確信此乃必勝之方策。今帝國海軍以航空部隊爲先員，共赴國難，擊滅　敵英美，誓期克盡護國大任</p>
<p>台灣菲島海空戰果</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日米內海相，二十七日在議會席上，曾作戰况報吿演說，其中關於台灣海面空戰及菲律賓海面海戰之戰果如次：台灣海面空戰，擊沉航空母艦十一艘，戰艦二艘，巡洋艦三艘。菲律賓海面空戰，擊沉航空母艦八艘，巡洋艦四艘，此數字僅爲主要擊沉之戰果，此外更有如大本營所發表者，於台灣海面空戰時，擊沉敵巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘，擊毀敵航空母艦八艘，戰艦二艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘及艦種不詳者十三艘。於菲律賓海面海戰，擊沉敵驅逐艦四艘以上，擊毀敵航空母艦九艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦三艘，並擊落敵機的五百架，總計台灣海面空戰，已擊沉擊毀敵航空母艦十九艘，戰艦四艘，巡洋艦七艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦二艘，艦種不詳者十三艘。於菲律賓海面海戰，擊沉擊毀敵航空母艦十一七艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋六艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦三艘，驅逐艦四艘，輸送船四艘以上，擊落敵機約五百架以上。</p>
<h3>敵機昨襲東京擊落十四架　予以損害者二十七架</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日大本營二十七日下午七時發表：二十七日下午敵B29型機約五十架，自馬里亞納來襲東京，嗣後至下午五時，判明邀擊戰果，擊落十四架，（內不確實者五架），予以損害者二十七架，擊落敵機中之一架，係由於拼撞擊落，日方損害自炸及拼撞未歸還者，共計四架。</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　馬里亞納基地之敵B29型機約五十架，二十七日午十二時三十分左右，至下午二時，以一架或八架爲一編隊，七次侵入東京，中途於靜岡縣，曾投彈若干，幾無損傷。侵入東京後，主要在對工業地帶投彈，由於日制空部隊之勇敢迎擊，與官民防空陣之迅敏活動，損害極爲輕微。是役所予敵方之架之八成，計四十一架，於此空前戰果不中，有敵機二架係由拼撞而擊落，日方損害加算拼撞之二架，計犧牲四架，市民眼見於東京上空之激烈空戰中敵機噴火墜落之醜態。</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　馬利亞納方面敵B29型機數隊，二十七日十二時餘，侵入日本本土，以關東地區及東京四周爲主，投下燒夷彈及炸彈，經日方防空部隊猛烈反擊，遭受相當損失，戰果詳情，目下在調查中，日方損害輕微。</p>
<h3>爪哇青年編成拚撞攻擊隊</h3>
<p>爪哇二十七日中央社電　大東亞戰爭已突入決戰階段，在此現狀下之爪哇靑年，經過去三年來精神與肉體之訓練，現已收得極大之效果。此等爪哇靑年，不僅祖當民族進軍之前衛，且獻身援助日軍作戰。以求將來光榮之獨立早日實現，其信念愈形堅定。全島靑年團，防衛義勇軍，爪哇奉公會等靑年團之猛進，均爲愛國熱誠之表現，荷蘭統制時代之頹廢，已行脫掉，而入於精神肉體之體格訓練戰。目下自表面觀，爪哇以及其他受有相當訓練之以軍事訓練及勤勞奉爲出前進之方向，彼等聞神風特攻隊之活躍，莫不感激，於是自動編成拚撞攻擊隊，假若敵人迫近爪哇，誓願化本身爲魚雷，而發揮報國精神。中央參議院議長史加爾諾，於該隊，謂爪哇青年現今積極步入新世界，年長者若遲怠，則自己不免落於此等之青年之後。</p>
<h3>日機夜襲昆明機場</h3>
<p>遂贛機塲亦被炸</p>
<p>大陸基地二十七日中央社電　日轟炸機隊近來屢襲渝美空軍基地昆明機塲，二十一日夜擊毀停留地上之大型機六架，二十四日復於月夜空襲該地，排除其防空砲火，作低空轟炸，毀大型機十六架，兩日計擊毀二十二架之多，其他重要設施亦受損甚大，日機均無事歸還。</p>
<p>大陸前綫日軍某基地二十六日中央社電　日轟炸機隊二十六日利用月色，空襲敵殘存之遂川贛州兩基地，並於敵機停留處投下巨彈，擊毀敵機三架，日機全隊安然歸返。按遂川贛州兩地，爲敵軍向中南部和平地區及南海方面之反攻據點，目下以湖南芷江作基地，集中戰爆機百架以上，藉謀空中補給，然屢遭日空軍夜間轟炸，輸送力日趨弱化云</p>
<h3>日海空部隊轟擊桑霍塞</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日軍海上部隊，二十六日傍晚出動於明多羅島桑霍塞海面，對敵機基地加以猛烈砲擊，日航空部隊亦與此呼應，轟炸敵飛機塲，炸毀陸上設施及物資積集所數處。下午九時十五分，日艦復突入曼林灣，攻擊敵運輸船團，施以雷擊砲擊，擊沉擊毀滿載兵員軍需物資之敵運輸船四艘及魚雷艇二艘，舟艇二艘，日艦安全退出。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍某基地二十六日中央社電　日航空部隊連夜空襲明多羅島趕造中之桑霍塞機塲，蒦得重大戰果，於二十五日夜猛襲該地南部機塲之滑走道中央北側，命中巨彈，使三處起火燃燒，機塲北部亦發生火災，日機全部安全歸返。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>期待於新任市當局者</h3>
<p>昨天國府明令發表，本市市長由周佛海先生兼任，並由安徽省長羅君强先生轉任本市市府秘書長。我們在本月二十五日社評中，亟盼中樞從速決定市長人選，並提出市長理想人選若干點。現在中樞決定以周氏兼任，並以羅氏輔弼，我們對此人選表示欣幸。</p>
<p>上海的地位旣極重要，而上海的一般問題又極複雜與嚴重，一般民生的艱苦，達於極點，而少數的暴利主義，却囂張跋扈。這種現象，我們在過去已經數四指陳，茲不贅述。總而言之，目前上海需要解決的實際問題，旣多又急，而在客觀情勢上，更不得不以快刀斬亂麻的嚴峻手段，才能達到根治病根的目的。現在新任人選已定，就是醫治上海病的醫生已經聘到了。上海市的病因病狀狠爲顯著，不待多加診斷已經瞭然，惟一的需要就是怎樣治療的方案，怎樣決定入手的方法而已。我們站在人民的立塲，站在病家的立場，應該陳述的話很多。於此，先就最主要的幾點，加以申述，以供新任當局的參攷：</p>
<p>第一，用人唯才主義。用人唯才，本來是政治革新的必要原則，人才的消長，必然是政洽良窳的騐證。客觀上很完善的制度，很周密的法令，沒有人才就不能運用，不能推動。所謂徒法不能自行。上海市的各級行政機構，都因爲人才太少，所以，機構不靈，進行迂緩，或者彼此牽制，效率不彰。今後希望一方面實踐用人唯才主義，選用專家，提高待遇。一方面淘汰冗員，節約經費。如果發覺某部分機構人事不相稱，甚或有作弊行爲，就須以最大的勇氣與決心加以改革刷新。</p>
<p>第二，剷除官僚作風。市民需要的是做事的官，而不是做官的官。只會做官而不會做事的官，一定是官僚作風，一事無成、在做官者本身固然一官在身，名利雙收，而在治下的市民，却奄無益處，甚且受盡痛苦。所以，在市民心目中，對於做事的官，一定擁護，一定合作。對於官僚的官，一定鄙棄，一定淘汰。</p>
<p>第三，重視市民利益。市民要求當局重視全體利益，發爲表示的就是民意。所以，希望常局重視市民利益，就須重視民意。同時，在市民方面爲要求實現全體利益，必須積極的協力政府。一般惟以私利爲重的暴利主義者，惟以取巧的等待主翁者，都是不能協力者，也應排除制裁。目前上海需要解決的問題，急迫嚴重，政府單獨的力量，不够解決，必須市民協力。所以，政府重視民意與市民積極協力，處於同樣的重要地位。</p>
<p>過去上海需要的工作，是側重於接收租界，統一行政。今後上海需要的工作，是側重於解決實際問題，如何制裁暴利主義者？如何剷除貪汚份子？如何穩定物價？如何確立治安？是實際問題中應該最先解決的課題。周佛海先生具有豐富的政治經騐，素主人才主義，衆望所歸。羅君强先生是久著聲譽的實幹主義力行者，故司法行政部長張雲搏氏曾盛讚羅氏强毅果敢的作爲。解決當前課題，最需要大刀闊斧，風行草偃的膽識，周羅兩氏實爲理想的執行者，不勝翹企引望。</p>
<p>陳前市長就任四年，屢在艱難環境中，辛苦領導，尤於接收租界，統一行政致力獨多。吳前秘書長協助接收租界，厥功尤允偉，由第一區公署主任秘書昇調，具見襄贊輔弼之功，我們更不勝表示惜別之意。</p>

<h3>日島田中佐談　最近大陸戰況　敵美計劃徒見心勞日拙</h3>
<p>南京廿七日中央社電　盟邦派遣軍總司令部報道部島田中佐，本日四時在日本記者俱樂部接見中國記者，就最近之大陸戰綫及駐渝美空軍現況加以說明，略謂：</p>
<p>退出獨山基於戰略</p>
<p>「此次完全佔領桂林柳州後，即分其一部兵力繼續進攻，終於最近佔領獨山，因此引起渝軍之極度不安，蓋渝軍深恐日軍或將因此繼續進攻貴陽以至重慶。此次日軍在西南方面作戰之主要目的，乃在根本擊滅駐渝美空軍之基地，故自佔領桂林柳州後，一部即繼續向前進攻，一部積極從事警備佔領地。而日軍自佔領獨山而又自動退出時，渝方即誇大宣傳謂日軍敗退等語，其實日軍此種舉動，全爲基於上述旨趣。</p>
<p>渝軍損失異常重大</p>
<p>至此次河南湖南作戰中，渝軍損失綜合如下：此次戰役中實際參加之軍隊的在一百個師左右，其中損失者的在五十個師以上，至士兵之死傷，連北緬方面在內，總在七十萬以上，又物資方面損失，亦比往年多出二倍以上。蓋河南方而爲八個軍之人的給養基地，而湘桂地區爲十個軍之人的給養基地，今盡行喪失，此影響於渝軍前途關係，不可謂不大。尤因桂林柳州之多數兵工廠及湖南廣西之龐大農產等重要資源之喪失，對今後之兵器及軍需方面之補完，更屬不堪設想。</p>
<p>敵美基地致命打擊</p>
<p>至駐渝美空軍之現况，自桂林柳州等基地相繼喪失後，其實力由於日軍不斷轟炸，日趨低弱，現成都基地以轟炸日本本土爲對象，昆明基地以肓炸漢口以下長江地區爲目標，而遂川贛州等地，因僅能容納小型飛機，故專任擾亂和平地區之用，其轟炸目標初尙爲各軍事設施，在最近如漢口等地之迭次肓炸而觀，除軍事設施外，一般民衆區域亦不顧一切加以盲炸，此蓋因其最近在非島方面作戰失利，於是爲呼應起見，乃有此不斷盲目轟炸後方之蠢舉。</p>
<p>登陸作戰終屬夢</p>
<p>又關於渝方最近竭力希望美軍能在中國大陸沿海登陸進攻日軍，從而迫使日軍退出中國大陸，期能幫助渝方收復失地，至少亦可藉此切斷日本本國與南方日軍之補給路綫，以削日軍力量，然此種希望終屬夢想而已。蓋自渝方迭受不斷打擊後，美軍之補給路綫盡行遮斷，現僅剩官染已久之萊多公路，萊多公路能否成功，即成功後能發揮多大補給效能，在在都成問題。故渝方希望美軍從速在中國大陸登陸，終屬不可能之事，而徒見其心勞日拙而已。</p>
<h3>德軍渡薩爾河設立橋頭堡　比境德軍佔領兩要衝</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電海通社訊：最近二十四小時內，德軍在突破區內之戰事極爲激烈，美軍襲擊德軍側翼，幷未獲逞，德軍司令部早料其有此舉動，故能予以有組織之抵抗。美軍壓迫德軍攻勢陣綫之側翼，係在南側巴斯托尼（Bostogne）兵力的有數師之衆，均這擊退。而前日德軍攻勢向西面與西南，則仍有進展，德軍方面雖未宣佈該處之進展情形，反軸心軍方面己承認德軍已進抵巴斯托尼西南三十公里之里勃拉蒙（Libremont）德軍現正擇反軸心軍陣綫之弱點進攻，如在薩爾格米納斯附近，今已渡過薩爾河設立橋頭堡多處.</p>
<p>里期本二十七日中央社電　據前綫消息：德軍已佔領瑪希西南要衝羅煦佛爾，（Rochefort）又於比利時南部戰綫進攻中之德軍，亦佔領里勃拉蒙要衝。</p>
<p>攻守兩軍兵力比較</p>
<p>沮里希二十七日中央社電　此間那黑里希頓報著論稱：西綫德軍以七十五師兵力，與反軸心軍九十師相對峙，自二十六日之攻勢開始後，以上兵力差額已起甚大變化，現似爲八十五師對九十師，尤以德軍每師兵力最大爲八千名，英美軍一師則爲一萬五千名左右，大體反軸心軍方面的爲百三十五萬，而德軍僅爲六十四萬，但兩軍所有之飛機戰車似屬相等，故戰鬥不可僅以表面數字妄加評斷</p>
<h3>雅典會議　內容守秘密</h3>
<p>邱吉爾或將訪蘇</p>
<p>日內瓦二十七日中央社電　德國社訊，日內瓦消息靈通人士稱，英首相邱吉爾與外相艾登於訪問雅典之餘，或將更進一步而訪問莫斯科，此等人士之意見認爲希臘問題解決之希望，繫於斯達林之態度。</p>
<p>葡京二十七日中央社電　海通社訊，倫敦政界人士紛紛揣測邱吉爾艾登訪問雅典之情况，且有認爲此行或爲英美蘇三國政治領袖會議之先聲者，雅典之外交頓見活動，但英首相之行蹤至爲秘密，昨日午後邱吉爾與希臘政黨會議之地點，英美記者尙不知云。</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　據雅典電，英首相邱吉爾鑑於希臘內亂，影響英國內政外交，極爲焦慮，乃於廿五日偕外相艾登及地中海方面軍司令亞歷山大，乘機飛抵雅典，親自參與和平交涉。抵雅典後，立即召集英軍司令斯科比少將，駐西亞專員麥克米蘭，及駐希大使等聽取現地情勢報吿。嗣與希臘大主敎師達瑪斯基赭斯及首相巴班特魯會見，結果決定與左翼黨團舉行休戰會議，在大主敎斡旋之下，於二十六日下午四時在雅典市英軍司令部舉行。由大主敎主席，首由英首相邱吉爾闡述舉行會議之旨趣，復由希臘各派代表協議，會議內容極守秘密。據所發表公報稱，爲使希臘國之兄弟相戰熄止，期其恢復聯合各國內之地位。會塲地帶戒備森嚴，然會塲前陰溝中，竟發見四分之三噸高性炸彈</p>
<h3>四國在美談判新租軍協定</h3>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　據華盛頓電：美國務卿斯蒂丁紐斯昨接見新聞記者稱，英美蘇渝四者對於武器租借新協定，目下正在交涉中。美國某報紙最近載稱，美對蘇武器租借案現行協定已告滿期，所傳停止之說純屬無稽。</p>
<h3>湖南廣西從軍記</h3>
<p>日軍以奇襲或强進的戰術，突入廣西，終於像秋風捲落葉似地佔領了美國駐華空軍的前衛據點桂林。冒着炎暑，爬山越嶺，由湖南一直衝向廣西，其間都龐嶺吹來的風，寒冷刺骨。經過半年的艱苦作戰，軍服破碎，皮革底瀾，縱一日兩餐而實行艱苦的急行軍，也成爲習慣，快步如飛而不停地前進着。這全都是手胼足胝，忍飢受寒的勇士。北自漢口，南至桂林，一千公里的長征，始終記者像在旋風中步行着一樣，而寫出這樣一　從軍記。</p>
<p>從武富車站出發時，年靑的運輸指揮官，向全體隊員發令「裝彈！」於是立刻感覺到，戰火將燃燒到自己的身旁。這是準備應付襲擊軍用列車的渝方飛機的。指揮官天聲發着「打下來，一定要打下來」的命令，而兵士把步槍搭在窗口上。美國空軍探知日本發動大攻勢，於是舉全力來攻。美國飛機上的白星標識，令人感覺到特別的憤慨，從岳州到洞庭湖的進攻，接着展開了長沙的攻防戰。田園裏因連日的傾盆大雨，全成爲泥海，這種行軍眞是困難萬分。但頑强阻撓前進的，是無數地雷陳地。</p>
<p>前此都認爲牢不可破的「薛岳防綫」，而現在已土崩瓦解，甚至岳麓山上的砲兵陣，也掩旗息鼓，鴉雀無聲，終於長沙不保了。並不因此而停息，立刻又向衡陽進攻了。美國飛機的出動，愈益加多，美國戰鬥機P五一和P四〇的引擎聲，始終不離衡陽的市空。馬路兩旁柳樹，都因轟炸和砲擊，完全剝去了樹皮，而嶄新地刻鏤着彈痕。十五公尺寬的馬路，完全成了修羅塲。星星點點冒着黑燜的，是肓炸民宅美國飛機的成績。夜間的衡陽街道，只充滿着冗長的兵士隊伍。無燈的汽車忽忽前進着，巨砲也默默無聲地前進着，坦克車也轟轟地後面追隨着。由長沙至衡陽這一百二十公里的中間，宛延不絕地機械部隊在流着。日本包圍衡陽，開始總攻擊時，渝方爲營救城內駐軍，曾以十數師團發動反包圍。向衡陽攻擊的日本隊伍，對於背後的敵人也不能放鬆。所以前面街陽市內的第一錢，與後面渝軍的第一綫距離，只不過數公里。腹背受敵，使我們毫不敢鬆懈。在夜間，只好忱戈待旦。忍受着這樣痛苦，仍然繼續不斷地向衡陽進攻。</p>
<p>渝方的自供是：「我們的失敗並不是由於日本軍的砲擊，也不是由於日本的空中轟炸。而是敗於專能忍受困苦貧乏的日本精神力」。</p>
<p>九月秋天一到，日本精銳部隊突然開始向桂林進攻了。在連結衡陽和桂林的湘桂公路上，每天前進二十公里的速度，一舉而陷零陵，直接深入廣西省境，目約　取桂林。日軍前進的迅速，渝軍竟無暇破壞二十公尺寬的湘桂公路。在湖南省看慣的平頂山胡，現在已經沒有了，眼前所有者，全是聳立入雲的峻嶮山峯。山峯頂上，到處都有瞭望哨。或許這就是防備空襲的桂林瞭望哨。當我們日本飛機襲擊時，則一個轉一個地燃起狼烟來，眞是一種原始時代的監祖綱。人家雖少，但古色古香的二層建築，却很多。在中國的窗　格上都糊着紙。穿越山岩之間的湘江流水，非常淸晰。日軍佔領全縣和興安後，十日上旬就開始向桂林開火了。長沙和銜陽如果說是激烈的要塞攻擊，那末桂林就是岩石攻擊。渝方飛機的出動，自從桂林攻防戰以來，突然減少了。有一天，從岩多的後面突然出現了許山渝方飛機，瞬息間撒下無數傳單來。但這已經無能爲力了，桂林的守軍，早已知道大勢已去了。日本機械化部隊前方引導的桂林進攻，終於勢如破竹，完成了歷史任務。（靖譯自十二月八日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>地院昨審訊　居奇操縱米商　交保不准改期再訊</h3>
<p>本市警察局經濟保安處，于上月十四日在滬西長甯路一帶拘獲米蠹李福根等十七名之多，經偵查訊得該輩米蠹專事在滬西周家橋地方設立米店，操縱黑市米價，乘機居奇猛抬，以致黑市價格暴漲，漫無止境，彼輩專向從南翔北新涇七實等地走販收買，以賤價收取囤積，重價販出，輾轉手間，每石至少可盈利二三千元，尤其雨天，機會最好，因各地走販較少，彼輩藉詞貨缺，猛加暴利，因此彼輩以五萬十萬資金，至今均已身價百倍以上，實屬不法已極。經濟保安處查明盤實，幷搜出囤米，確有操縱米價囤積居奇，經解送上海地方檢察署偵查終結，實逢反戰時刑事特別法第十七條第一項之罪嫌，合依刑事訴訟法第一三〇條第一項向本市地方法院提起公訴。昨（廿七）日下午二時地院特開刑二庭審理，除泰公米店孫傳民氏因病交保外，其餘被告李福根（立大），陸實根（福大大興），朱慶隆（長豐），趙鴻仁（恒盛新），狄耀宗（福順），金振亞（豐來），呂雲鶴（源豐），談煥文（天民），張文開（裕記），戴世元（復生），沈祖勳（合盛），李展（同昌），蔡企華（協豐），朱寶興（永興），夏長生（德盛），楊長生（同盛）等，均解庭受　，由推事趙冠駿訊問，被告延周文斌陳榮發等律師辯護，各被告供詞支吾，頗爲狡猾，冀　卸罪，經庭上再三審訊，始瞠目無言，後各被告均託詞要求交保，趙推事以案情重大，諭知不准，着看管羈押。至患病之孫傳氏下次庭訊，必須投案，如抗違即飭票拘提，幷諭改期再訊。按戰事特別刑法第十七條規定，戰時意圖營利，對軍需或生活必需品投機操縱或囤積居奇，足以妨害供求關係或未受允准設立市塲，爲類似交易所之買賣者處死刑，或無期徒刑，得倂科十萬元以下罰金。</p>

<p>上海瓦斯公司，以時入冬令，用戶之消費量激增，有違戰時節約原則，頃決定對違反戰時節約原則之用戶，停止供給煤氣，截至目前爲止，已有數十家用戶因過份浪費，而遭停止供給，預定在正月以前，將超過規定用量之用戶，全部剪斷。過去該公司於執行剪斷煤氣時，事前曾有警告函件分別發送，今後則不問有否接得是項警告，決採取斷然措置。聞用戶中有向抄表員賄賂，使超過量算入次月，此種惡劣用戶，今後一旦發現，決予以永遠停止供給處分，該公司希望各用戶能購備柴炭等燃料，傳節約煤氣用量。</p>

<p>讀者助學消息</p>
<h3>積財莫如積德　請富有之家輸財助學</h3>
<p>本報爲助學金而發動的「特別勸募」，自本月一日開始，作緊急呼籲，於今將近一月，依當初我們的計劃，想儘這一個月中，組成一千隊，達到二千萬元目標，固然這一月來，得到工商各界的後援，尤其各校學生熱烈響應，奔走勸募，然其成績，以隊伍而言，只有計劃中的十分之一强，以捐款而言，僅及總數五分之一强，這在助學的立塲上說，的確我們感到很失望！雖說目前市面不景氣，工商都蕭條，內在的困難也很多，然而就我們平日見聞所得，上海一般商人，連年獲得意外暴利的人，多如過江之　，就像本報主辦的助學金，其意義可謂深長，其性質也可謂積極；然而真正有錢的人，從來就很少捐款，而捐款的人，到還是清苦的人，並非言之過甚，在每日發表的助學消息裏，就找得出真憑實據來。平日爲生活壓迫的人，當然心餘力薄，無法解囊，我們不希望他們出錢，甚望積財千萬，甚至萬萬以上的人，都能澈底瞭解人生觀念，「積財莫如積德」，而多多捐助，功德眞是無量！照我們的理想：倘使大財主每人捐助一二百萬，也不算稀罕，那末這二千萬元，一二十個人，便可凑集，敬代五千清寒子弟，九頓首以叩！</p>

<p>昨由楊光政君經募中華電影公司捐助「義丐」第一隊，楊君並以「義丐」身份，發起組織義丐隊，緣起見本版，我們希望本此精神，效法武訓精神。滬新中學理一各級同學，繼工三之後，成立第二隊，諸君發揮學生自助的力量，成此義舉，殊堪嘉許。張純青小姐勸募張王表兄弟隊，崔泉聲經募匯利服裝號隊，盧志學經募固本隊，至深感佩。又樂助隊，邢志剛，馮幼偉，孫瑞璜，諸君均認一隊，倂誌謝忱。（昨報所刋贊同隊，係大新公司及先施公司合組，永安隊係永安公司捐認，特爲補正。）</p>

<h3>組織「義丐隊」緣起</h3>
<p>— 楊光政</p>
<p>在遜清道光時，有義丐武訓，平日雖破衣惡食，但却以行乞所得，涓滴節儲，先後在柳林·館陶·臨清等地創設義學，得使清寒子弟，有受教育的機會。這種行乞興學，捨身爲衆的精神和行爲，眞可動天地而感鬼神！倘若人人能夠如此，則吾國家非但不至如此破碎，而且早已强盛起來了！</p>
<p>吾國教育，向稱落後，而至今日，物價高漲，何止千倍，教員生活不堪維持，學生求學無錢入校。長此下去，受教育的優秀份子日少，將來如何還能在世界上競爭生存呢？申新兩報創辦助學貸學，實爲補救之一法。筆者向藉筆桿謀生，本是一個文丐，雖無義丐的精神，實具義丐之心腸，惟因平時入不敷出，本人捐欵極微，因特發起組織「義丐隊」，以文丐的身份，謹向各界公開求乞。已先向攝製「義丐」鉅片的中華電影公司捐得二萬元，作爲「義丐第一隊」。茲特撰此緣起，敬祈全國同胞，聞風響應，不論貧富，量力捐助，捐欵多少不拘，滿二萬元即組一隊，使此「義丐隊」由第一隊而第二隊而至第百千萬隊！</p>
<p>義丐武訓，精神卓絕，其身世行爲，應爲全國所效法。中華電影公司以此題材，攝成影片，又在大光明，美琪與南京三大戲院放映。此片不特深具意義，而且藝術技巧與佈景配音等亦極高明。凡吾同胞，應去一看，看了以後，應知我人雖不必盡作「義丐」，但不可不爲教育文化與民族命脈，而搶救失學，而慷慨與學！何况在今日之下，享的樂未必快活，發的財未必可靠，若再不爲國家前途着想，那末人人都有淪爲乞丐的可能了！</p>
<p>各界同胞，筆者今日以文丐的身份，拜懇諸位乘此民族國家尚可有救的時候，先盡一點力量，捐幾筆款子，帮助失學的青年兒童，使他們受到教育，成爲優秀的國民，好到將來爲大衆多出一點力量，多有一點貢獻！</p>
<p>諸位捐欵，請賜交「申報助學金辦事處」「義丐隊」收，本隊收到後即奉給收據，滿二萬元後即成隊公佈。並先祝諸位仁人君子爲子孫造福，功德無量！（稿酬助學）</p>

<h3>記慈幼教養院　聖誕節游藝會</h3>
<p>— 小祝</p>
<p>十二月廿五日，這在國際和中國都有重大寓義的紀念日的下午，大興路慈幼教養院舉行慶祝聖誕遊藝會，一方面固然給該院教養中的百數十名無告的羔羊以一年一度的歡樂，另一方面更乘機招待一般以偉大的人類之愛心而慷慨捐助的仕女們，讓大家看到自己的愛心捐助，正在爲國家社會培養出一批批健康有爲的新幹部來！</p>
<p>遊藝會由該院的「小樂隊」奏樂開始，那些孩子們齊整鮮豔的服裝和活潑飽滿的精神，與純熟的奏樂技術，首先就給來賓以非常深刻的印象。接着就由該院傑出的天才女生張月華致開會詞，用清脆而正確的國語，傳達出這批憂患餘生的孩子們的心聲：</p>
<p>「我們雖然不都是信仰宗教的孩子，但耶穌救世救人的精神，值得我們感謝學習和發揚。耶穌有一顆熱烈的愛心，他熱愛全人類，特別是貧病的人們。他的愛心，感化了所有的信徒和非信徒，我們也就在社會廣大的愛心之下獲救了。」</p>
<p>她特別有力地宣言：「現在我們年齡很小，而且還在被救濟的狀况下生活，但等到我們有一天能自立了，必須將所有的力量，去帮助許多的我們同命運的兄弟姊妹。」</p>
<p>最令人感動的是她强調地呼喊：「今天，我們接受了社會的愛心而成長，明天，我們要用兩倍的愛心，去報答社會！」</p>
<p>於是，在安慰和滿意的情緒下，開始了游藝的演出。首先是差不多全體院生參加的歌詠「天使報信」接着是該院低年級院生的唱歌表演「小矮人」，慈幼歌詠隊演唱「霓裳羽衣曲」，接着看到該隊另一節目二部合唱的「和平」和全體演出的「青年進行曲」，在各方面都顯出該院音樂教員達思甘女士的教導能力，但更令人驚奇這些苦兒們的音樂天才和苦學的成績。尤其能博得掌聲的是中年級的唱歌表情「誰和我玩」和「金絲鳥」及低年級的唱歌表情「月兒圓」，「金絲鳥」及「誰和我玩」都由中年級女生謝素青主演，已是相當可觀的「歌劇」。接着又有兩支土風舞。</p>
<p>對於該院體育教員趙禄卿的苦心指導和院生的健美表現，勢將同樣令人銘感。</p>
<p>慈幼體育部那一幕博得熱烈掌聲的「疊羅漢」表現後，不斷在來賓座中爆發炸彈一樣的掌聲者，要算是慈幼話劇社的話劇表現「被迫害者」了，該劇表演大時代下苦難之一羣，因飢寒交迫而分化，貧病的父親不得已作賊而終至被捕，母親不得已跟着流氓和走狗的暴發戶，甚至爲「不忍愛女挨苦」而誘逼其女當幫導，特別强調表現有志氣的工人阿毛及其情人翠花在飢寒暴力四面楚歌中，竟能認清是非順逆，不作小偷，不作走狗，不作賣淫婦，不作寄生虫，女的在最後不惜自殺，男的認清大敵而冒險踏上新生的戰鬥之路。這劇本給人以最鼎盛的滿意，雖然該院的「大導演」張心怡小姐還是那麼謙遜地說愧慚愧慚。</p>
<p>游藝會以聖誕老人對苦難兒童們分贈各方捐贈的禮物而告結束，一百數十個男女院生，各人都分得一大袋果物　，新的鞋襪，新的衣衫，小心嵌裏的狂歡，這才是莊嚴的狂歡啊！人人競向勞苦功高的姚主任道謝，姚主任更　嘻開了嘴，笑得合不攏來的忙着招呼，她的內心也許更加歡樂，歡樂平日艱苦支持的慈幼教養院的事業，從今天起將獲得社會上熱心人士更廣泛的認識。就是主辦慈幼教養院的中華慈幼恊會，今天也有汪主任殷勤招待來賓，他也滿臉笑容地向人訴說該會這次勸募成績雖好，尚待各界仁人志士更熱烈的贊助呢！</p>
<p>辭出慈幼教養院，由充滿着基督愛心的熱情與狂歡之「家」，踏進這嚴冬酷寒而近黃昏的冷街，不由的想起該院天才女生張月華的一句話：</p>
<p>「今天，我們接受社會的愛心而成長，</p>
<p>明天，我們要用兩倍的愛心，去報答社會　！」</p>
<p>社會服務</p>

<h3>Both Houses of the Japanese Diet Hold Plenary Sessions, Passing Resolutions of Gratitude and Condolence; Army and Navy Ministers Express Resolve and Deliver Thank-You Speeches</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese House of Peers held a plenary session at 10:06 AM on the 27th. After various reports were made, the session moved to the agenda. As a result of the elections, Duke Tadashige Shimazu was elected Chairman of the Whole Committee. Subsequently, standing committee members were elected, and the session recessed at 10:20 AM. It reconvened at 10:52 AM. After reporting the results of the standing committee elections, Army Minister Sugiyama and Navy Minister Yonai separately reported on the war situation since the previous session. They then proposed a resolution of gratitude and condolence for the fallen soldiers of the Army and Navy, which was unanimously passed. The Army and Navy Ministers stood up and expressed their resolve to fight, stating that the significance of the resolution would be quickly conveyed to all officers and soldiers, inspiring the entire army to display special attack spirit and sacrifice together with the hundreds of millions of citizens to defeat the arrogant enemy. With this, all agenda items for the year were completed, and the meeting adjourned at 11:57 AM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The plenary session of the Japanese House of Representatives convened at 2:50 PM.

With this, all agenda items for the year were completed, and the meeting was adjourned at 4:37 PM.</p>
<h3>Army and Navy Ministers Report on War Situation at the 86th Session of the Diet</h3>
<p>Army Minister's Report</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Army Minister Sugiyama's report on the main points of the war situation at the Diet is as follows: I will now report on the Army's war situation since the last Diet session:</p>
<p>Peleliu and Morotai Islands</p>
<p>First, regarding the Pacific front, the enemy forces used the "Mariana" Islands as a forward base for the invasion of Japan. On September 15th, they forcibly landed on Peleliu Island and Morotai Island. The local Japanese Army and Navy bravely resisted. The brave soldiers on Morotai Island, for over three months since the enemy landing, utilized the difficult terrain and jungles, actively engaging in close combat and launching daring attacks. At the same time, the Japanese Army Air Force continuously launched fierce attacks, inflicting heavy damage on one division of the enemy landing force. Most of the eight airfields painstakingly constructed by the enemy were destroyed. The Japanese forces on Peleliu Island, with a small number of soldiers and unwavering spirit, engaged in long-term, repeated close combat against the enemy's three divisions. To date, the enemy has suffered over 20,000 casualties, which has prevented the enemy from utilizing the base. The courageous battles on both fronts have made a significant contribution to the Philippine operations.</p>
<p>Burma-India Front</p>
<p>Second, on the "Burma" front, the Japanese forces, over several months since mid-May, inflicted heavy blows on enemy forces that were dozens of times larger. Since September, all of our soldiers have died gloriously in battle. Their valiant fighting can be seen in the great achievement of killing approximately 35,000 enemy soldiers. Since late September, the Japanese forces near Longling have launched a new offensive, greatly hindering the enemy forces, who were eager to open up the Ledo Road. On the "Northern Burma" front, the Japanese forces launched preemptive attacks against the American forces of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, which was attempting to advance south in coordination with the Chongqing troops west of the Nu River, repeatedly reorganizing their positions and advancing courageously. Furthermore, the Japanese Army Air Force and ground troops intercepted and shot down 188 enemy aircraft between October 1st and December 15th. In addition, there were signs of activity by the British fleet in the Indian Ocean. On October 20th, enemy mobile forces were active in the Nicobar Islands, but were immediately driven away by the brave ramming attacks of the Japanese Air Force.</p>
<p>Homeland Defense</p>
<p>Third, in Manchuria and the northern regions, the Army in Manchuria and the northern borders of the homeland are wholeheartedly fulfilling their missions in the severe cold, and the defenses are as solid as a rock. In addition, the heavy industrial zone of Manchuria is sometimes subjected to air raids by the Chongqing-American Air Force, and the Japanese forces are always closely cooperating with the Manchurian Army to intercept them. Fourth, regarding homeland defense, the American Air Force, based in mainland China and the Mariana Islands, has repeatedly launched attacks, mainly targeting the Tokyo, Northern Kyushu, and Nagoya areas of the Japanese homeland. Their purpose is to destroy rear production or to shake the morale of the people in the rear through indiscriminate bombing. In the future, their attacks will inevitably become more intense. The Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces and ground troops immediately and resolutely intercept enemy aircraft whenever they attack, and have inflicted considerable damage to date. At the same time, they have further launched long-range air raids on enemy bases such as Chengdu and the Mariana Islands, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<p>China Front</p>
<p>Fifth, on the "China Front," since April 20th of this year, it has been eight months. Braving the intense heat and overcoming hardships, we have launched attacks and successively captured strategic points such as Luoyang, Hengyang, Guilin, and Nanning, covering a distance of 1,600 kilometers. As a result, most of the main air bases that the enemy had built in southwestern China over the past two years have been destroyed. On the 10th of this month, the advantageous situation on the mainland side of this cross-continental road was further strengthened. During this period, the enemy's losses, in addition to the collapse of the air bases, included the recovery of approximately 250,000 bodies and prisoners, and approximately 1,200 artillery pieces. In particular, the air combat was extremely fierce. From April to December 10th of this year, nearly 400 enemy aircraft were shot down over the mainland, and over 1,400 were destroyed. The efforts of the Japanese Air Force in achieving this great victory cannot be fully described in words. The damage inflicted on the Chongqing forces and the Chongqing-American Air Force in this operation was enormous, and it is difficult to conceal the anxiety of Chiang Kai-shek and the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>Philippine Front</p>
<p>Sixth, in the Philippines, since October 12th, the American mobile forces, despite encountering fierce and heavy blows in the naval and air battles off the coast of Taiwan and the Philippines, again invaded Leyte Gulf in the Philippines with a large transport fleet on October 17th and landed. Currently, the war situation is evolving with the enemy mainly occupying the plains on the east coast of Leyte Island. The Japanese forces are securing the towering ridges and mountain ranges to the west, and with a small number of soldiers, are attacking the enemy's seven divisions everywhere. The war situation is advancing and retreating, and is extremely complex. Following the heroic "Takachiho" airborne corps' attack, in December night, the Takachiho parachute unit also conducted a landing attack on the enemy airfield. At the same time, the ground troops also made a breakthrough and occupied the Shengbalong and Saint Paul Airfields, inflicting major damage on the enemy air bases. The enemy further increased their forces and forcibly landed near Albuera on the west coast of Leyte. On the 2nd of this month, they broke into Ormoc City, and on the 15th, they landed in one corner of Mindoro.</p>
<p>Air Force Achievements</p>
<p>Currently, the Philippine war situation has expanded from Leyte Island to the Visayan region, and the most intense battles are unfolding. Especially the air battles are the fiercest battles in the history of the Japanese military. Whether attacking, intercepting, or bombing enemy warships, the intensity is difficult to describe in words. In particular, the loyalty of the Japanese Army Special Attack Squads and the cooperation with the Navy's Kamikaze Special Attack Force in carrying out ramming attacks have chilled the enemy's hearts. We are searching for these enemy warships with the aim of certain death and certain hit. Those engaged in ramming attacks are all young soldiers around the age of twenty. Their sincerity in devoting themselves to the country cannot help but be admired. The achievements of these Army Special Attack Squads between November 12th and December 22nd, only those that have been confirmed, are the sinking or damaging of 49 enemy warships, including 5 battleships and 32 transport ships. In addition, 38 were damaged or set on fire, including one large aircraft carrier, 27 transport ships, and others, totaling 87 ships. Now, the enemy mobile forces and transport convoys have been severely damaged. In addition, the Japanese Army Air Force's attacks on enemy warships in Leyte Gulf and other Philippine coastal waters have resulted in the sinking or damaging of 32 enemy warships and the destroying and setting on fire of 91 ships, totaling 123 ships, in addition to those of the aforementioned Special Attack Squads, between October 18th and December 22nd. In addition, the number of enemy aircraft shot down by the Army alone has reached 662.</p>
<p>Perfect Unity</p>
<p>Although the enemy authorities rely on material resources, they are urging their citizens to rise up, saying that judging from the current state of consumption, with the super-human efforts of the United States, the frontline supply situation will improve. That is to say, the number of American casualties in the war has reached 500,000. The American military authorities' announcements regarding human losses are completely contradictory, which shows that the actual number of deaths and injuries is extremely high. However, even though the American military has suffered the above heavy blows, their will to fight cannot be violated, and they are extremely eager to overcome all difficulties and win this decisive battle in the Philippines. The future of the war situation is undoubtedly significant, and our Army is also attacking the invading enemy forces in order to complete the operations in that area. At this time, only the ramming spirit of the Special Attack Squads can defeat the enemy and make them lose their will to fight. The ramming of our Special Attack Squads is truly the essence of our national polity for three thousand years, and is also the condensation of the indignation of one hundred million citizens and the unparalleled strength of the Imperial Army. Our Army is united from top to bottom, and is one with the Navy. Whether on the front lines or in the rear, all soldiers and officers will adopt the spirit of the Special Attack Squads and the Suicide Squads, vowing to destroy the enemy and reassure the Emperor.</p>
<p>Navy Minister's Report</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Navy Minister Yonai reported on the war situation at the Japanese Diet on the 27th as follows: I will now explain the general overview of the Imperial Navy's war situation since the previous Diet session, and express my beliefs. Regarding the war situation, the General Headquarters has made announcements each time.</p>
<p>Major Battles Concentrated in the Philippines</p>
<p>In the approximately three and a half months since the previous Diet session, the battles have been mainly concentrated in the Philippines. The enemy forces are strongly attempting to recapture it, while the Japanese side is exerting efforts to defend it, and fierce battles are continuing. From July to September, the Nimitz fleet, which captured the bases in the Mariana Islands, and the MacArthur forces, which advanced north from New Guinea, coordinated with each other and revealed their intention to aggressively invade the Philippines. From early to mid-September, the enemy forces first launched repeated air raids on the Philippines, attempting to deplete the Japanese air power in the area, in order to use it as a base for recapturing the Philippines, and landed on Peleliu, Angaur, and Morotai Islands. Subsequently, the enemy forces further attacked the Southwest Islands and Taiwan, which are the supply routes for the Japanese forces in the Philippines, thus igniting the air battle over the Taiwan Strait. Subsequently, the enemy mobile forces attacked Taiwan with their powerful air force. Therefore, the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces launched continuous, courageous, and repeated attacks on the enemy mobile forces day and night from October 12th to 16th, sinking 11 aircraft carriers and 2 battleships, and repelling them. Following the actions of this mobile force, the MacArthur forces, which had gathered in the New Guinea area, finally invaded Leyte Gulf in the Philippines on October 17th, and landed on Leyte Island on the 19th. Although the enemy forces suffered heavy damage in this landing operation, they were able to expand their territory, and under the cover of the remaining mobile forces, they increased their landing forces.</p>
<p>Navy to Thoroughly Destroy the Enemy with All its Might</p>
<p>The Japanese Combined Fleet, in order to pursue these enemy mobile forces, concentrated its air power, surface forces, and submarines, and launched a thorough attack on the entire enemy force. In particular, during the naval battle off the coast of the Philippines from October 24th to 26th, the Japanese forces achieved the sinking of 8 enemy aircraft carriers and 4 cruisers. During this period, the Japanese side also suffered some losses. The air battle over the Taiwan Strait and the naval battle off the coast of the Philippines resulted in the destruction of most of the enemy's main aircraft carriers for the counteroffensive operations against Japan due to the successive attacks by the Japanese forces. After that, the Philippine operations centered on Leyte Island gradually intensified, and the attrition warfare of the frontline aircraft became very intense, so the outcome of the war depended on the amount of supplies. During this period, the Kamikaze Special Attack Force exemplified the great righteousness of loyalty and devotion to the country, and promoted the spirit of certain-death attack, which boosted the morale of the Japanese frontline soldiers. The enemy forces, in order to prevent the supply of Japanese frontline aircraft, disrupted and attacked the Japanese rear, and further intensified the air raids on the aircraft production areas in the homeland. At the previous Diet session, it was emphasized that in modern warfare, regardless of the Army or Navy, gaining air supremacy is the most important thing in modern warfare. Therefore, we earnestly hope that the citizens will cooperate in order to increase the number of aircraft to be sent to the front lines.</p>
<p>Aircraft Production Being Intensified Day by Day</p>
<p>Currently, the progress of Japanese aircraft production is being intensified day by day due to the cooperation and assistance of those involved in various fields, in order to meet the demands of the severe war situation. Therefore, the Japanese forces were able to secure air supremacy in the Philippines, and at times even achieved a position of parity with the enemy. Recently, there have been situations where we have fallen into the hands of the enemy. As the enemy forces entered the Sulu Sea, they finally landed on Mindoro Island on December 25th, which is regrettable. The position of the Philippines in the Japanese war operations is familiar to everyone, and it goes without saying that we must defend it to the end. At this time, we should not be constrained by the gains and losses of the local war situation, but should rapidly open up the current situation with unwavering faith. The only way to do this is to use the power of the divine spirit to turn the tide into an offensive, and ultimately use the Philippines as the decisive battleground, take advantage of the strategic advantages of the Japanese forces in that area, break through the enemy's most painful weaknesses, and use this to achieve final victory. Therefore, 100 million citizens should overcome all difficulties with the spirit of special attack, and rapidly convert all of the nation's strength into combat power and invest it in the decisive battlefield, believing that this is the winning strategy. Now, the Imperial Navy, with the Air Force as the vanguard, is going to face the national crisis, destroy the enemy, the United States and Britain, and vows to fulfill its great mission of protecting the country.</p>
<p>Air and Sea Battle Results in Taiwan and the Philippines</p>

They dropped some bombs in Shizuoka Prefecture along the way, causing almost no damage. After invading Tokyo, they mainly dropped bombs on industrial areas. Due to the courageous interception of the Japanese air defense forces and the rapid activities of the government and civilian air defense systems, the damage was extremely minor. In this battle, 80% of the enemy aircraft were damaged, totaling 41 aircraft. In addition to this unprecedented achievement, two enemy aircraft were shot down by ramming.

<h3>Javanese Youth Form Ramming Attack Squad</h3>
<p>Java, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage. Under these circumstances, the Javanese youth, after three years of mental and physical training, have achieved great results. These Javanese youth are not only the vanguard of the national advance, but also dedicate themselves to assisting the Japanese military in its operations. Their belief in achieving glorious independence in the near future is becoming increasingly firm. The rapid advancement of youth groups such as the island-wide Youth Corps, the Defense Volunteer Army, and the Javanese Public Service Association is a manifestation of patriotic fervor. The decadence of the Dutch rule era has been shed, and they have entered an era of mental and physical fitness training. Currently, from the surface, Java and other areas that have received considerable training are using military training and diligence as the direction of their advancement. They are all grateful when they hear of the activities of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force. Therefore, they have automatically formed a ramming attack squad, vowing to turn themselves into torpedoes and display the spirit of serving the country if the enemy approaches Java. Speaker Sukarno of the Central Advisory Council said to the squad that Javanese youth are now actively entering a new world, and if the elderly are lagging behind, they will inevitably fall behind these youth.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations of the New Municipal Authorities</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the National Government issued an official decree, appointing Mr. Zhou Fohai concurrently as the Mayor of this city, and Mr. Luo Junqiang, the Governor of Anhui Province, as the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government. In our editorial on the 25th of this month, we earnestly hoped that the central authorities would promptly decide on the candidate for mayor and put forward several points regarding the ideal candidate. Now that the central authorities have decided to appoint Mr. Zhou concurrently and Mr. Luo as his assistant, we express our delight at this selection.</p>
<p>Shanghai's position is extremely important, and Shanghai's general problems are extremely complex and serious. The hardship of the general populace has reached its limit, while the profiteering of a few is rampant and overbearing. We have repeatedly pointed out this phenomenon in the past, and we will not repeat it here. In short, there are many and urgent practical problems that need to be solved in Shanghai at present, and in terms of the objective situation, it is necessary to use resolute measures to cut through the tangled mess quickly in order to achieve the goal of eradicating the root of the problem. Now that the new candidate has been appointed, the doctor to treat Shanghai's illness has been hired. The causes and symptoms of Shanghai's illness are very obvious, and there is no need for much diagnosis to understand them. The only need is for a treatment plan and a decision on how to start. Standing on the position of the people, standing on the position of the patient's family, there are many things we should say. Here, we will first elaborate on the most important points for the reference of the new authorities:</p>
<p>First, adopt a meritocratic approach to employing people. Employing people based on talent is a necessary principle of political reform. The rise and fall of talent is inevitably a test of good or bad governance. Objectively perfect systems and meticulous laws cannot be used or promoted without talent. As the saying goes, laws cannot enforce themselves. All levels of administrative agencies in Shanghai suffer from a lack of talent. Therefore, the agencies are not responsive, the progress is slow, or they check each other, and the efficiency is not obvious. In the future, it is hoped that, on the one hand, the principle of employing people based on talent will be practiced, experts will be selected, and salaries will be increased. On the other hand, redundant staff will be eliminated, and expenses will be saved. If it is discovered that the personnel of a certain institution are not commensurate with their positions, or even engage in fraudulent behavior, it is necessary to reform and refresh them with the greatest courage and determination.</p>
<p>Second, eradicate bureaucratic practices. What the citizens need are officials who do things, not officials who are just officials. Officials who only know how to be officials but do not know how to do things are bound to be bureaucratic, and they will accomplish nothing. While the officials themselves hold office, reap fame and fortune, the citizens under their rule receive no benefit and even suffer. Therefore, in the eyes of the citizens, they will definitely support and cooperate with officials who do things. They will definitely despise and eliminate bureaucratic officials.</p>
<p>Third, value the interests of citizens. What the citizens require from the authorities is to value the interests of the whole, and what they express is public opinion. Therefore, if the authorities want to value the interests of the citizens, they must value public opinion. At the same time, in order to realize the interests of the whole, the citizens must actively cooperate with the government. Those profiteers who only value private interests and those who only wait for opportunities to be clever are all those who cannot cooperate and should be excluded and sanctioned. The problems that need to be solved in Shanghai at present are urgent and serious. The government's sole power is not enough to solve them, and citizens must cooperate. Therefore, the government's emphasis on public opinion and the citizens' active cooperation are of equal importance.</p>
<p>In the past, the work needed in Shanghai focused on taking over the concessions and unifying administration. In the future, the work needed in Shanghai will focus on solving practical problems. How to sanction profiteers? How to eradicate corrupt elements? How to stabilize prices? How to establish public security? These are the issues that should be resolved first among the practical problems. Mr. Zhou Fohai has rich political experience and has always advocated talent. He is widely expected to succeed. Mr. Luo Junqiang is a well-known pragmatist and practitioner. Therefore, Mr. Zhang Yunbo, the Minister of Judicial Administration, once praised Mr. Luo's strong and decisive actions. Solving the current problems requires decisiveness and the courage to act swiftly and decisively. Mr. Zhou and Mr. Luo are ideal executors, and we are extremely hopeful.</p>
<p>Mayor Chen, who has been in office for four years, has worked hard to lead in difficult circumstances, especially in taking over the concessions and unifying administration. Former Secretary-General Wu assisted in taking over the concessions, and his contribution was particularly great. He was promoted from the director and secretary of the First District Office, which shows his merit in assisting and supporting. We can't help but express our regret at his departure.</p>

The funds have been distributed to the affected households by the Provincial Police Department.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka of the Japanese Army Discusses Recent Situation on the Mainland Battlefield The Enemy's American Plans are Futile and Backfiring</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka of the Allied Forces General Headquarters Press Department met with Chinese reporters at the Japanese Press Club at 4:00 p.m. today, explaining the recent situation on the mainland front and the current situation of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. In brief:</p>
<p>Withdrawal from Dushan Based on Strategy</p>
<p>"After completely occupying Guilin and Liuzhou this time, a part of the troops continued to advance and finally occupied Dushan recently, which caused extreme anxiety to the Chongqing army, because the Chongqing army was deeply afraid that the Japanese army might continue to attack Guiyang and even Chongqing. The main purpose of the Japanese army's operations in the southwest this time was to fundamentally destroy the bases of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. Therefore, after occupying Guilin and Liuzhou, a part continued to advance, and a part actively engaged in guarding the occupied areas. When the Japanese army occupied Dushan and then voluntarily withdrew, the Chongqing side exaggerated and claimed that the Japanese army was defeated, etc. In fact, this action of the Japanese army was entirely based on the above-mentioned purpose.</p>
<p>Chongqing Army Suffered Extremely Heavy Losses</p>
<p>As for the losses of the Chongqing army in the Henan and Hunan operations this time, the comprehensive losses are as follows: The actual number of troops participating in this battle was about 100 divisions, of which more than 50 divisions were lost. As for the casualties of soldiers, including the North Burma area, the total was more than 700,000. In terms of material losses, it was more than twice as much as in previous years. Because Henan was the supply base for the people of eight armies, and the Xiang-Gui area was the supply base for the people of ten armies, they have now been completely lost. This impact on the future of the Chongqing army cannot be said to be small. Especially because of the loss of most of the military factories in Guilin and Liuzhou and the huge agricultural production in Hunan and Guangxi and other important resources, it is even more unimaginable for the replenishment of weapons and military supplies in the future.</p>
<p>Fatal Blow to Enemy American Bases</p>
<p>As for the current situation of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, after the successive loss of bases such as Guilin and Liuzhou, its strength has gradually weakened due to the continuous bombing by the Japanese army. At present, the Chengdu base is aimed at bombing the Japanese mainland, and the Kunming base is aimed at indiscriminate bombing of the Yangtze River area below Hankou. Because SuiChuan, Ganzhou and other places can only accommodate small aircraft, they are dedicated to disrupting peaceful areas. The bombing targets were initially military facilities. Judging from the repeated indiscriminate bombings of places such as Hankou recently, in addition to military facilities, civilian areas are also indiscriminately bombed regardless of everything. This is because of its recent defeat in the operations in the non-island area, so in order to respond, there is this constant indiscriminate bombing of the rear.</p>
<p>Landing Operations Ultimately a Dream</p>
<p>Also, regarding the Chongqing side's recent efforts to hope that the US military can land on the coast of mainland China to attack the Japanese army, thereby forcing the Japanese army to withdraw from mainland China, hoping to help the Chongqing side recover the lost land, at least to cut off the supply line between Japan and the Japanese army in the south to weaken the Japanese army, but this hope is ultimately a dream. Since the Chongqing side has suffered repeated blows, the US military's supply lines have been completely cut off, and now only the long-standing Ledo Road remains. Whether the Ledo Road can succeed, and how much supply capacity it can exert after success, are all questions. Therefore, the Chongqing side's hope that the US military will land on mainland China as soon as possible is ultimately impossible, and only shows that their efforts are futile and backfiring.</p>
<h3>German Troops Cross the Saar River and Establish Bridgehead German Troops Occupy Two Important Points in Belgium</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency dispatch): In the past 24 hours, the fighting in the breakthrough area was extremely fierce. The US military's attack on the German flank was unsuccessful. The German command had anticipated this move and was able to resist it in an organized manner. The US military's pressure on the flank of the German offensive front was in the south of Bostogne, with a force of several divisions, all of which were repelled. The German offensive to the west and southwest continued to make progress the day before yesterday. Although the German side did not announce the progress there, the anti-axis forces have admitted that the German troops have advanced to Libremont, 30 kilometers southwest of Bastogne. The German troops are now choosing the weak points of the anti-axis forces' line to attack. For example, near Saargeminas, they have now crossed the Saar River and established many bridgeheads.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to front-line news: German troops have occupied Rochefort, an important point southwest of Marche. German troops attacking on the southern Belgian front have also occupied Libremont, an important point.</p>
<p>Comparison of Military Strength Between Attacking and Defending Forces</p>
<p>Zurich, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Neue Zürcher Zeitung here commented that the German army on the Western Front is confronting the anti-axis forces with 75 divisions against 90 divisions. Since the offensive began on the 26th, the above-mentioned difference in strength has changed greatly. It now seems to be 85 divisions against 90 divisions. Especially since the maximum strength of each German division is 8,000, while an Anglo-American division is about 15,000. Overall, the anti-axis forces have 1.35 million troops, while the German army has only 640,000. However, the number of aircraft and tanks owned by the two armies seems to be equal. Therefore, battles cannot be judged by superficial figures.</p>
<h3>Athens Conference Contents Kept Secret</h3>
<p>Churchill May Visit the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Geneva, 27th (German News Agency dispatch) Sources in Geneva said that British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden may visit Moscow in addition to visiting Athens. These people believe that the hope for a solution to the Greek problem depends on Stalin's attitude.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) Political figures in London are speculating about Churchill and Eden's visit to Athens, and some believe that this trip may be a prelude to a meeting of political leaders from Britain, the the United States, and the Soviet Union and Chongqing. Diplomatic activity in Athens has suddenly increased, but the British Prime Minister's whereabouts are very secret. Yesterday afternoon, British and American reporters did not know the location of Churchill's meeting with Greek political parties.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a dispatch from Athens, British Prime Minister Churchill is extremely anxious about the Greek civil strife, which affects British domestic and foreign policy. On the 25th, he flew to Athens with Foreign Secretary Eden and General Alexander, commander of the Mediterranean Army, to personally participate in peace negotiations. After arriving in Athens, he immediately summoned Major General Scobie, commander of the British army, McMillan, commissioner to West Asia, and the British ambassador to Greece to listen to a report on the local situation. Subsequently, he met with the Greek Archbishop Damaskinos and Prime Minister Papandreou, and decided to hold a truce conference with the left-wing party groups. Under the mediation of the Archbishop, it was held at the British military headquarters in Athens at 4:00 p.m. on the 26th. The conference was chaired by the Archbishop. First, British Prime Minister Churchill elaborated on the purpose of holding the conference, and then representatives from all parties in Greece discussed it. The content of the conference was kept extremely secret. According to the published communiqué, it was to put out the fratricidal war in Greece and restore its position among the united countries. The conference area was heavily guarded, but 750 kilograms of high-explosive bombs were found in the drain in front of the conference venue.</p>
<h3>Four Countries Negotiating New Lend-Lease Agreement in the US</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a dispatch from Washington: US Secretary of State Stettinius told reporters yesterday that Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing are currently negotiating a new lend-lease agreement for weapons. An American newspaper recently stated that the current agreement on the US lend-lease program to the Soviet Union has expired, and the rumor that it has been stopped is purely nonsense.</p>
<h3>A Record of Joining the Army in Hunan and Guangxi</h3>
<p>The Japanese army broke into Guangxi with tactics of surprise attacks or forced advances, and finally occupied Guilin, the forward base of the US Air Force stationed in China, like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. Braving the scorching heat, climbing mountains and crossing ridges, marching from Hunan to Guangxi, the wind blowing from the Dupang Mountains was bitterly cold. After half a year of hard fighting, military uniforms were torn, leather soles were worn out, and even eating two meals a day and carrying out arduous rapid marches became a habit, and they moved forward quickly and non-stop. These were all brave men who worked hard with their hands and feet, endured hunger and cold. From Hankou in the north to Guilin in the south, the reporter felt like he was walking in a whirlwind throughout the 1,000-kilometer long march, and he wrote such a record of joining the army.</p>
<p>When departing from Wufu Station, the young transportation commander issued an order to all members: "Load your guns!" Then I immediately felt that the flames of war would burn beside me. This was to prepare for the Chongqing army's planes that attacked the military train. The commander issued an order in a loud voice: "Shoot them down, be sure to shoot them down!" And the soldiers put their rifles on the windows. The US Air Force learned that Japan had launched a major offensive, so it launched a full-scale attack. The white star markings on the American planes made people feel particularly angry. The attack from Yuezhou to Dongting Lake was followed by the battle of Changsha. The fields were all muddy seas due to days of torrential rain, and marching in such conditions was extremely difficult. But what stubbornly hindered the advance was the countless landmines laid.</p>
<p>The "Xue Yue Defense Line", which was previously considered unbreakable, has now collapsed, and even the artillery positions on Yuelu Mountain have lowered their flags and stopped their guns, and there is silence. Finally, Changsha was lost. But it did not stop there, and immediately attacked Hengyang. The number of American planes dispatched increased even more. The sound of the engines of the American fighter planes P-51 and P-40 was always present in the airspace over Hengyang. The willow trees on both sides of the road were completely stripped of their bark due to bombing and shelling, and new bullet marks were carved. The 15-meter wide road was completely turned into a slaughterhouse. The black smoke rising in dots was the result of the indiscriminate bombing of civilian houses by American planes. The streets of Hengyang at night were filled with long lines of soldiers. Cars without lights moved forward suddenly, giant cannons also moved forward silently, and tanks followed closely behind with a roar. In the 120 kilometers between Changsha and Hengyang, the endless mechanical units were flowing. When Japan surrounded Hengyang and launched a general attack, the Chongqing side launched a counter-encirclement with dozens of divisions in order to rescue the troops stationed in the city. The Japanese troops attacking Hengyang could not relax their guard against the enemy behind them. Therefore, the distance between the front line in Hengyang City and the first line of the Chongqing army behind was only a few kilometers. Being attacked from both sides made us not dare to relax at all. At night, we had to sleep with our spears as pillows. Enduring such pain, we continued to attack Hengyang.</p>
<p>The Chongqing side confessed: "Our failure was not due to the Japanese army's artillery fire, nor was it due to the Japanese aerial bombardment. But it was defeated by the Japanese spirit that could endure hardship and poverty."</p>
<p>As soon as autumn arrived in September, the elite Japanese troops suddenly began to attack Guilin. On the Xiang-Gui Highway connecting Hengyang and Guilin, they advanced at a speed of 20 kilometers per day, captured Lingling in one fell swoop, and went directly into the territory of Guangxi Province, aiming to take Guilin. The Japanese army's advance was so rapid that the Chongqing army had no time to destroy the 20-meter wide Xiang-Gui Highway. The flat-topped mountains that were common in Hunan Province are now gone, and all that is in front of us are towering and steep peaks. There were lookout posts everywhere on the tops of the peaks. Perhaps these were the Guilin lookout posts to prevent air raids. When our Japanese planes attacked, they would light beacon fires one after another, which was truly a relic of primitive times. Although there were few people, there were many quaint two-story buildings. The window panes in China were all covered with paper. The Xiang River flowing between the mountains and rocks was very clear. After the Japanese army occupied Quanxian and Xing'an, they began shelling Guilin in early October. If Changsha and Hengyang were fierce fortress attacks, then Guilin was a rock attack. The number of Chongqing planes dispatched suddenly decreased since the battle of Guilin. One day, many Chongqing planes suddenly appeared from behind the rocks and dropped countless leaflets in an instant. But this was already powerless, and the defenders of Guilin already knew that the situation was gone. The Japanese mechanized unit leading the attack on Guilin finally completed its historical mission with irresistible force. (Translated by Jing from the December 8th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Household Registration Changes Issuance Methods Determined Adjustment of Commodity Rationing Office System Procedures</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the system of rationing of major food items in the city according to the number of people, the Municipal Commodity Rationing Office, in order to complete the issuance system and procedures for the entire city, specially established various issuance offices to complete the centralization of issuance. The personnel of each issuance office have been re-adjusted, and the issuance methods for handling changes in citizen household registrations have been carefully stipulated by the third section of the office. The details are specially reported below:</p>
<p>Old Certificates Need Not Be Returned</p>
<p>Regarding changes in citizen household registrations, in the past, rationing certificates often could not be issued quickly. The reasons for this were not entirely due to delays in issuing certificates by the various issuance offices, which caused citizens to feel deeply inconvenienced. In order to thoroughly adjust this situation, rationing certificates obtained for changes in citizen household registrations do not need to be returned in any case, in order to eliminate the accumulation of malpractices from the middle.</p>
<p>Re-exchange for New Certificates</p>
<p>After citizens move to a new address, they can send the household registration change certificate, together with the municipal general donation receipt, and the remaining rationing certificates, to the issuance office where they previously received the rationing certificate. The office will stamp the rationing certificate with a "void" seal, and add the words "This certificate can be exchanged for a rationing certificate of the same period at a certain issuance office" on the back, and then take it back to the designated issuance office to go through the procedures for exchanging for a new rationing certificate, in order to be fast. Each issuance office should paste the recovered and exchanged discarded certificates into whole sheets and report them to the third section of the office daily for verification and to prevent fraud.</p>
<p>Citizens Die or Return to Their Hometown</p>
<p>If citizens die or return to their hometown, the rationing certificates they have received should be returned to the original issuance office. The issuance office will stamp the certificates with a death or return to hometown stamp, and cancel them in the register. Then the citizens should submit the certificates along with other documents such as movement certificates to the Baojia section of the police station in charge to complete the registration of death or return to hometown. However, each issuance office should make a list of the number of discarded certificates recovered each month for future reference and must not delay, otherwise they will be punished.</p>
<p>Citizens from Other Places Move In</p>
<p>If citizens from other places move into the city to live, each issuance office should first submit the application for moving in and the house donation receipt to the third section of the office. After approval, they can issue rationing certificates. The rationing certificates that have been used should be stamped with the word "void". The whole sheet should be issued and should not be cut, in order to prevent fraud.</p>
<h3>District Court Yesterday Hearing: Rice Merchants Who Hoarded and Manipulated Prices; Bail Denied, Rescheduled for Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>The Economic Security Division of the Municipal Police Bureau arrested as many as seventeen rice weevils, including Li Fugeng, in the Changning Road area of ​​West Shanghai on the 14th of last month. After investigation and interrogation, it was found that these rice weevils specialized in setting up rice shops in the Zhoujiaqiao area of ​​West Shanghai, manipulating black market rice prices, taking the opportunity to hoard and drastically raise prices, resulting in soaring black market prices with no end in sight. They specialized in purchasing from peddlers traveling from Nanxiang, Beixinjing, Qishi, and other places, collecting at low prices for hoarding, and selling at high prices. In the process, they could earn at least two or three thousand yuan per stone. Especially on rainy days, the opportunities were best because there were fewer peddlers from various places. They used the excuse of a shortage of goods to drastically increase profits. Therefore, with capital of fifty thousand or one hundred thousand yuan, their net worth has now increased more than a hundredfold, which is extremely illegal. The Economic Security Division investigated and verified the facts, and also seized the hoarded rice, confirming that they had manipulated rice prices and hoarded for profit. After the Shanghai Local Procuratorate concluded its investigation, they were found to have violated Article 17, Paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Law Against Wartime Offenses and, in accordance with Article 130, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, filed a public prosecution with the Municipal District Court. Yesterday (27th) at 2:00 PM, the District Court specially convened the Second Criminal Court to hear the case. Except for Sun Chuanmin of Taigong Rice Shop, who was released on bail due to illness, the other defendants, Li Fugeng (Lida), Lu Shigen (Fudadaxing), Zhu Qinglong (Changfeng), Zhao Hongren (Hengshengxin), Di Yaozong (Fushun), Jin Zhenya (Fenglai), Lü Yunhe (Yuanfeng), Tan Huanwen (Tianmin), Zhang Wenkai (Yuji), Dai Shiyuan (Fusheng), Shen Zuxun (Hesheng), Li Zhan (Tongchang), Cai Qihua (Xiefeng), Zhu Baoxing (Yongxing), Xia Changsheng (Desheng), Yang Changsheng (Tongsheng), etc., were all brought to court. Judge Zhao Guanjun questioned them, and lawyers Yan Zhouwenbin, Chen Rongfa, and others defended the defendants. The defendants' testimonies were vague and quite cunning, hoping to escape punishment. After repeated interrogations in court, they were speechless. Later, the defendants all requested bail, but Judge Zhao ruled that the case was serious and denied bail, ordering them to be detained. As for Sun Chuanmin, who was ill, he must surrender to the court at the next hearing, or he will be arrested. He also ordered a rescheduled hearing. According to Article 17 of the Special Criminal Law for Wartime Offenses, anyone who, during wartime, intends to profit by speculating, manipulating, or hoarding military supplies or necessities of life, thereby undermining supply and demand or establishing a market similar to an exchange without permission, shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment, and may also be fined up to 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gas Exceeds Limit; Supply Stopped</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Gas Company, in light of the winter season and the surge in consumer consumption, which violates wartime conservation principles, has decided to stop supplying gas to users who violate wartime conservation principles. To date, dozens of users have had their gas supply stopped due to excessive waste. It is expected that before the first month of the new year, all users exceeding the prescribed consumption will have their gas cut off. In the past, the company issued warning letters before cutting off gas, but in the future, it will take decisive action regardless of whether a warning has been received. It is rumored that some users are bribing meter readers to have excess consumption counted in the next month. If such unscrupulous users are discovered in the future, they will be permanently cut off from the gas supply. The company hopes that all users will purchase firewood, charcoal, and other fuels to conserve gas consumption.</p>
<h3>Measures to Facilitate Accommodation for Out-of-Town Travelers; Police Bureau Orders Hotels to Comply</h3>
<p>In this city, large and small hotels often have local residents renting rooms for entertainment. This trend is prevalent today, to the point where almost all hotels are occupied. The tea servers, greedy for generous tips, will not lend rooms unless it is for this purpose, and refuse outright. Legitimate travelers from out of town find it difficult to find lodging, which encourages extravagance and increases travel difficulties. In order to correct this phenomenon, the Police Bureau has formulated a "Provisional Method for Shanghai Special Municipality Hotels (Restaurants) to Provide Accommodation for Travelers from Outside Shanghai," which stipulates that each hotel, depending on its size, must reserve a portion of rooms each day, with the number of rooms and their numbers clearly indicated on a sign posted in a prominent location for out-of-town travelers to rent at any time. This will initially be implemented in dozens of first-class hotels, including the International Hotel, Yangtze Hotel, Wu Palace Hotel, Dajiangnan Hotel, Andong Hostel, Huizhong Hostel, Oriental Hostel, Oriental Hotel, New World Hotel, Nanjing Hotel, Zhongzhou Hostel, Cangzhou Hotel, New New Inn, Jue Lu Hotel, Continental Hotel, Shanghai New Hostel, Jinshan Hotel, Great Shanghai Hotel, Meng Jian Hostel, Jiangsu Hostel, Great China Hotel, Central Hostel, Jinmen Grand Hotel, Far East Hotel, China Hotel, Yipinxian Hostel, Shenzhou Hostel, Xinzha Hostel, Tongshang Hostel, Zhenhua Hostel, Natural Hotel, Zhongnan Hotel, Imperial Palace Hotel, Kang Le Hotel, Da Hu Hotel, Da Zhong Hotel, Asia Hotel, Dafang Hotel, Weida Hotel, Da Dong Hostel, Le Yi Hotel, East Asia Inn, and Paramount Hotel. If there is any deliberate violation, upon investigation by the Administrative Department of the Police Bureau or a branch bureau, or upon complaint by a traveler, penalties will be imposed. The aforementioned Provisional Method for Shanghai Hotels to Provide Accommodation for Travelers from Outside Shanghai is detailed below:</p>
<p>Provisional Method for Shanghai Special Municipality Hotels (Restaurants) to Provide Accommodation for Travelers from Outside Shanghai</p>
<p>(1) Each hotel (restaurant) in this city must reserve a portion of its rooms each day for travelers from outside Shanghai to rent and use at any time. The number of rooms reserved in the preceding paragraph shall be based on the following proportions: 1. For those with 200 or more rooms, 20% of all rooms must be reserved each day. 2. For those with 150 or more rooms, 14% of all rooms must be reserved each day. 3. For those with 100 or more rooms, 10% of all rooms must be reserved each day. 4. For those with 50 or more rooms, 8% of all rooms must be reserved each day.</p>
<p>(2) The grades of rooms reserved by each hotel (restaurant) for travelers from outside Shanghai should be allocated evenly.</p>
<p>(3) If the rooms reserved by each hotel (restaurant) for travelers from outside Shanghai have not been fully rented by 6:00 PM, they may be rented to local customers at their discretion, but 50% of the originally prescribed number of rooms must be reserved. If there are still rooms available after 9:00 PM, they may be rented to local customers, but the residence time of these local customers shall not exceed one day.</p>
<p>(4) The number of rooms reserved by each hotel (restaurant) for travelers from outside Shanghai shall be calculated in accordance with the proportion prescribed in paragraph 1 of this method and reported to this Bureau and the branch bureau in charge for record.</p>
<p>(5) Each hotel (restaurant) shall, before 11:00 AM each day, designate the numbers of the reserved rooms in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this method and record them in detail in the "Room Reservation Book for Travelers from Outside Shanghai."</p>
<p>(6) Each hotel (restaurant) shall set up a notice board in a prominent place, displaying the reserved room numbers each day and recording whether there are any guests, for investigation purposes.</p>
<p>(7) When travelers from outside Shanghai rent rooms in each hotel (restaurant), the reception staff of the hotel (restaurant) may request to see their residence permit and other documents for identification purposes.</p>
<p>(8) If each hotel (restaurant) is found by this Bureau's investigation or a traveler's complaint to have deliberately violated the provisions of this method, it may be fined up to ten times the rent of the room, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Banking Industry Can Safely Pass the End of the Year</h3>
<p>The annual business settlements of various banks and firms in this city, in terms of external affairs, have already completed the settlement of interest with commercial and savings departments. Regarding internal matters, the accounting aspects are being rushed to complete the annual business closure. The deadline can be extended to the 31st of this month. Since the 31st falls on a weekly holiday, business will continue as usual. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of January next year will be closed for three days as usual. All exchange-related matters of the various banks and firms, if they cannot be completed before 1:00 PM on the 30th (Saturday), can be handled according to regulations and on time when business resumes on the 4th. As for the funds of the various banks and firms during the settlement period, the Central Reserve Bank and the banking industry's reserve treasury will do their best to handle interbank lending, so the national and lunar New Year can be safely and steadily passed, it is said.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Implements Year-End Security</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau recently noted that the national lunar New Year is approaching in an instant, and remittances from various industries are frequent, which can easily attract the covetousness of petty criminals and disrupt social tranquility. Although it is during the winter prevention period, in order to consolidate the city's public security, it has specially ordered its subordinate police sub-bureaus to implement strict security measures as usual, thoroughly and carefully check residence permits at any time, and pay attention to passengers traveling to and from stations and ports, to prevent spies from infiltrating the urban area.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Adjusts Salaries</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau, in view of the rising cost of living in this city, believes that the salaries of police officers should also be improved. After careful discussion, it was decided that starting from October of this year, salaries and allowances will be increased by 100% of the original amount to stabilize the lives of police officers and improve the efficiency of police work. The salary increases for October and November are now being disbursed.</p>

<p>Readers' Aid to Education News</p>
<h3>Accumulating Virtue is Better Than Accumulating Wealth; Please Ask Wealthy Families to Donate to Help Education</h3>
<p>The "Special Solicitation" launched by this newspaper for the Educational Aid Fund, which began on the 1st of this month, made an emergency appeal. Now, nearly a month has passed. According to our original plan, we wanted to form 1,000 teams in this month and reach a goal of 20 million yuan. Although we have received the support of the industrial and commercial sectors this month, especially the enthusiastic response of students from various schools who have been soliciting donations, the results, in terms of teams, are only slightly more than one-tenth of the plan, and in terms of donations, they only reach slightly more than one-fifth of the total. From the standpoint of educational aid, we are indeed very disappointed! Although the market is currently depressed, business is sluggish, and there are many internal difficulties, based on what we usually hear and see, there are many Shanghai businessmen who have made unexpected and huge profits year after year, like the Educational Aid Fund sponsored by this newspaper, its significance can be said to be profound, and its nature can be said to be active; however, the truly wealthy have rarely donated, and the donors are still the poor. This is not an exaggeration. In the daily published educational aid news, you can find the real evidence. Of course, those who are oppressed by life on a daily basis are powerless and cannot afford to donate. We do not expect them to donate money, but we hope that those who accumulate wealth of millions, or even tens of millions, can thoroughly understand the concept of life, "Accumulating virtue is better than accumulating wealth," and donate more. The merit is truly immeasurable! According to our ideal: If each wealthy person donates one or two million yuan, it would not be uncommon. Then, 20 million yuan can be raised by ten to twenty people. On behalf of five thousand poor students, we bow nine times to thank you!</p>
<p>Grand View Garden Donates Gift Money to Help Education</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongyuan, General Manager of Grand View Garden, wrote in a letter: "Respected Sir, our company held its opening ceremony on the 24th of this month. After deducting the expenses, we received a total of 134,040 yuan in congratulatory gifts from all sectors. We are now donating half of that amount, 67,020 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, to your newspaper's Educational Aid Fund. This is just a drop in the ocean, but it is a small contribution. Please accept it."</p>
<p>Yantai Money Shop Donates Congratulatory Gifts to Help Education</p>
<p>Huang Yantang, Chairman of Hangzhou Yantai Money Shop, wrote in a letter: "Respected Sir, Hangzhou Yantai Money Shop has received its license from the Ministry of Finance and will open on January 5th, 34th year of the Republic. We declined congratulatory gifts from colleagues and friends. However, due to customs, some may send gifts, so we have stated in the invitations that they should be converted into cash and sent to the Shen Xin newspapers' student aid funds and the Zhejiang Shaoxing Hospital and Shanghai Leshan Society for charity purposes, so as to do good deeds on their behalf. We have sent this letter to inform you. Once we have collected the above-mentioned gifts, we will send another letter to remit the payment."</p>

<p>Yesterday's Newspaper Published at 6:50 PM</p>
<h3>Origin of Organizing the "Beggar of Justice Team"</h3>
<p>— Yang Guangzheng</p>
<p>During the Daoguang period of the late Qing Dynasty, there was the Beggar of Justice, Wu Xun. Although he wore ragged clothes and ate poorly, he saved every penny earned from begging and established charity schools in Liulin, Guantao, Linqing, and other places, giving poor children the opportunity to receive education. This spirit and behavior of begging to start schools and sacrificing oneself for the public can truly move heaven and earth and touch the gods! If everyone could do this, then our country would not only not be so fragmented, but would have long been strong!</p>
<p>Our country's education has always been considered backward, and today, prices have soared more than a thousand times. Teachers' lives are unsustainable, and students have no money to enter school. If this continues, the number of educated outstanding people will decrease every day. How will we be able to compete and survive in the world in the future? The Shen Xin newspapers' establishment of educational aid loans is a way to remedy this. I have always made a living by writing and am a literary beggar. Although I do not have the spirit of the Beggar of Justice, I have the heart of the Beggar of Justice. However, because I usually cannot make ends meet, my personal donations are very small. Therefore, I specially initiated the organization of the "Beggar of Justice Team" and, in the identity of a literary beggar, I respectfully beg the public. I have already obtained 20,000 yuan from the China Film Company, which produced the "Beggar of Justice" film, to be used as "Beggar of Justice Team 1." I have specially written this origin to respectfully ask all compatriots in the country to respond to the news and donate as much as they can, regardless of poverty or wealth. A team will be formed for every 20,000 yuan, so that this "Beggar of Justice Team" will grow from the first team to the second team to the hundredth or millionth team!</p>
<p>The Beggar of Justice, Wu Xun, had an extraordinary spirit. His life and actions should be emulated by the whole country. The China Film Company has made this theme into a film, which is being shown in the three major theaters of Da Guangming, Meiqi, and Nanjing. This film is not only deeply meaningful, but also extremely brilliant in artistic technique and set dubbing. All of our compatriots should go and see it. After seeing it, they should know that although we do not all have to be "Beggars of Justice," we must rescue those out of school and donate generously to education, culture, and the national lifeline! Moreover, under today's circumstances, the pleasures enjoyed may not be happy, and the wealth made may not be reliable. If we do not think about the future of the country, then everyone may become beggars!</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, today, in the identity of a literary beggar, I beg you to take advantage of the fact that this nation and country can still be saved, and first do a little bit of your part, donating some money to help out-of-school young children, so that they can receive education and become outstanding citizens, so that they can contribute more to the public and make more contributions in the future!</p>
<p>Please send your donations to the "Shen Bao Educational Aid Fund Office," "Beggar of Justice Team" for receipt. After the team receives it, it will issue a receipt. A team will be formed and announced after it reaches 20,000 yuan. And I first wish all of you benevolent gentlemen to create blessings for your children and grandchildren, and your merits will be immeasurable! (Payment for this article is for educational aid)</p>

<h3>Report on the Christmas Carnival at the Ciyou Orphanage</h3>
<p>— A Small Blessing</p>
<p>On the afternoon of December 25th, a day of great significance both internationally and in China, the Ciyou Orphanage on Daxing Road held a Christmas carnival. On the one hand, it was to provide the hundred-odd helpless lambs being cared for in the orphanage with an annual joy. On the other hand, it was to take the opportunity to entertain the ladies and gentlemen who generously donated with great humanitarian love, allowing everyone to see that their loving donations are cultivating batches of healthy and promising new talents for the nation and society!</p>
<p>The carnival began with a performance by the orphanage's "Little Orchestra." The children's neat and bright clothing, lively and full spirits, and skilled musical techniques immediately impressed the guests. Then, Zhang Yuehua, an outstanding and talented girl from the orphanage, delivered an opening speech, conveying the voices of these children who had survived hardships in clear and accurate Mandarin:</p>
<p>"Although not all of us are children of religious faith, the spirit of Jesus saving the world and people is worthy of our gratitude, learning, and promotion. Jesus had a passionate heart, loving all humanity, especially the poor and sick. His love touched all believers and non-believers alike, and we were rescued under the widespread love of society."</p>
<p>She emphatically declared, "Now we are very young and still living under rescued circumstances, but when we can be independent one day, we must use all our strength to help many of our brothers and sisters who share the same fate."</p>
<p>Most touching was her emphatic call, "Today, we accept the love of society and grow up; tomorrow, we will repay society with twice the love!"</p>
<p>Thus, in an atmosphere of comfort and satisfaction, the variety show began. First was the singing of "Angels We Have Heard on High" by almost all the orphanage students. Then there was a singing performance by the orphanage's lower grades, "Little Dwarfs"; the Ciyou Choir sang "Song of Rainbow Skirt and Feather Jacket." Following that, the team performed another piece, the two-part harmony "Peace," and the entire ensemble performed "Youth March." All aspects showed the teaching abilities of Ms. Dasgan, the orphanage's music teacher, but even more surprising were the musical talents and diligent learning of these unfortunate children. What particularly won applause were the middle-grade singing expressions "Who Will Play with Me" and "Goldfinch," and the lower-grade singing expressions "Round Moon," "Goldfinch," and "Who Will Play with Me," all starring Xie Suqing, a middle-grade girl, were already quite remarkable "operas." Then there were two folk dances.</p>
<p>The dedicated guidance of the orphanage's physical education teacher, Zhao Luqing, and the healthy performances of the students will surely leave a lasting impression.</p>
<p>After the Ciyou Sports Department's performance of "Human Pyramid," which won enthusiastic applause, what continued to erupt in the guests' seats like bomb explosions was the Ciyou Drama Club's drama performance "The Persecuted." The drama portrayed a group suffering in the great era, divided by hunger and cold. A poor and sick father was forced to become a thief and was eventually arrested. The mother was forced to follow thugs and the nouveau riche, even coercing her daughter to become a prostitute "to prevent her beloved daughter from suffering." It particularly emphasized how the aspiring worker Amao and his lover Cuihua, surrounded by hunger, cold, and violence, were able to distinguish right from wrong, refusing to become thieves, lackeys, prostitutes, or parasites. In the end, the girl committed suicide, and the boy recognized the great enemy and bravely embarked on the path of a new battle. This play gave the audience the greatest satisfaction, although the orphanage's "great director," Miss Zhang Xinyi, was still so modestly saying "I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed."</p>
<p>The carnival ended with Santa Claus distributing gifts donated from all sides to the suffering children. Hundreds of male and female orphanage students each received a large bag of fruits, new shoes and socks, and new clothes, carefulyl holding their joy - this is the solemn joy! Everyone rushed to thank Director Yao for her hard work. Director Yao smiled so widely that she could not close her mouth, busy greeting everyone. Her heart was perhaps even more joyful, rejoicing that the Ciyou Orphanage's cause, which she had been supporting arduously on weekdays, would receive a wider recognition from enthusiastic people in society from this day on. Even the China Ciyou Association, which sponsors the Ciyou Orphanage, had Director Wang cordially entertaining guests today. He also told people with a smiling face that although the association's fundraising efforts this time had been successful, it still needed more enthusiastic support from philanthropists from all walks of life!</p>
<p>Leaving the Ciyou Orphanage, stepping from the "home" filled with Christian love, enthusiasm, and carnival into the cold streets of late winter and approaching dusk, I could not help but think of the words of Zhang Yuehua, the talented girl from the orphanage:</p>
<p>"Today, we accept the love of society and grow up,</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we will repay society with twice the love!"</p>

<h3>Mr. Wang Shenglan Donates Funds to Benefit Impoverished Mothers, Designated for Free Delivery at Huisheng Hospital</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Shenglan wrote, "Respectfully, I have always been physically weak and have repeatedly benefited from the treatment of Dr. Shi Ruxiong, the founder of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital. I have witnessed the hospital's enthusiastic service, and I have learned that it has previously held free delivery services for commoners and refugees, provided medical treatment and medicine, and given away children's clothing, etc., which has been praised by all sectors for many years. I believe that free delivery is even more necessary in the current environment, so I have spent 50,000 yuan to donate to the hospital, designated for the relief of impoverished mothers. In order to facilitate management and seek universal benefit, I hereby send the funds to your hospital, to be used as the Huisheng Maternity Assistance Fund, distributed to impoverished mothers. As for how to distribute it, please plan properly. I am extremely grateful for your trouble. Attached is a check for 50,000 yuan, please check and receive it." Mr. Wang's enthusiasm for assisting childbirth and benefiting impoverished women is admirable. After consultation with the Huisheng Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, the following measures have been formulated:</p>
<p>(1) Pregnant women can register first according to the original method of this office, be investigated and qualified, issued an approval certificate, and introduced to the following Huisheng Hospitals to register nearby and receive prenatal checkups: (1) General Hospital at 313 Connaught Road (West) (Gordon Road West) (telephone 37133). (2) Nanshi Branch Hospital at 78 Xiaojiuhua Street, Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen. (3) Central Clinic at the west end of Aiwenyi Road (Changsha Road), next to Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Shop (telephone 91749 transfer).

<h3>Diagnostic Fee Commission for Charity</h3>
<p>Dr. Gu Naigang wrote, "Respectfully, the diagnostic fee commission that I proposed to allocate to your office's medical assistance fund has been in place for three months. Doctors inherently harbor the purpose of universal relief, so there should be a spirit of mutual assistance for this initiative. At this time of expensive rice and firewood, the prices of Chinese and Western medicines have repeatedly increased, and it is difficult for ordinary people to afford their daily lives. Once they are afflicted with illness, the cost of medical treatment and medicine is even more unaffordable. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all doctors will respond in droves, making commissions for assistance, in order to fulfill the human obligation of mutual assistance. Then the merit of benefiting the poor will be no small matter. I am submitting 650 yuan, which is 10% of the diagnostic fee income for November, and I hope that it will be allocated to the medical assistance fund. This small amount is only to fulfill my professional duty."</p>

<h3>Fundraising by the China Ciyou Association Will End at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>The China Ciyou Association, like other Ciyou organizations, pays great attention to the education and care of refugee children, but it pays even more attention to the issue of refugee children's future. The association's older refugee children receive vocational and craft training, and when the time is right, the association introduces them to apprenticeships and various production jobs. In addition, the association also carefully handles adoption matters. Many good families, in compliance with regulations, have received the association's assistance, taking many young and intelligent refugee children as adopted children, allowing these children to enjoy a happy family life again. For older girls, the association also properly handles the issue of female marriages, hoping that every adult girl can have a normal family life and serve society. Before handling child placement, the association's Child Protection Section assists in dispatching personnel for thorough investigation, and after placement, it often sends personnel to visit in order to ensure perfection. According to the above situation, the association's support for orphaned children is not only active relief work, but also a constructive and educational social undertaking, which urgently needs the support and maintenance of all sectors to cultivate good citizens for the next generation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this year's fundraising campaign of the association is scheduled to end on the 31st of this month. With only four days left until the end of the fundraising period, the secretariat is stepping up its work, actively promoting to all sectors, and hoping that philanthropists from all walks of life will continue to generously assist, in order to do as much as possible to benefit the refugee children.</p>
