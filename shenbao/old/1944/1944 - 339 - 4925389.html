<h3>日首相演詞</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日小磯首相，八日出席假帝國飯店舉行之駐日各國使節招待宴，即席發表演說，力言日本作戰之目的，並將敵英美制覇世界之野心與日本解放東亞之作戰目的互相對比，詳爲說明，　旨如次：</p>
<p>侵略勢力一掃無餘　值茲決定世界新運命之當前重大決戰之際，將此次戰爭之本質以及吾人作戰之旨的，特向世界詳爲關明。此次作戰，在求東亞民族之鄕土解脫英美人之壓迫，强制實行排除英美侵略者，保衛東亞之戰爭。大東亞戰爭爆發以來，日軍請銳勇戰奮鬥，自東亞境內驅逐敵人侵略勢力，　成復興東亞及興隆東亞　　礎。諸位祖國之中，亦有不少憂國之士，與日本同心協力，響應日軍作戰，，陸續奮起，共同獻身於復興東亞之聖戰。茲英美在中國勢力一掃無餘，緬甸，菲律賓均達到多年之希望，究成獨立，又收圖租界，撤廢治外法權之中華民國，現已究全成爲自主獨立之大國，正與日本協力向樹立東亞永次和平之途邁進。基於道義之新東亞建設，更與日俱進，强力進展，於是東亞各國各民族共同之建設理想結晶而爲大束亞宣言，即我東亞各國將東亞自英美之侵略榨取下解放，以求其復興。</p>
<p>經濟互惠開放資源　同時與世界只國在政治方面之相互平等，不咸脅，不侵略爲原則，進而求協力親善和平秩序之實現。於經濟方面，基於互惠之原則，求確保道義自由及開一天巿塲資源理想之實現。反之，英美馬俊企圖將全世界永遠隸弄堂口於彼等全權之下，襲斷世界資源，又飽其掠取之　，舞弄其謀略攻勢，擾亂軸心各國之結合，壓迫中立國謀誘入自已之勢力範圍，更妄信必獲勝利，高談戰後經營，對國際和平假裝誠意，然彼等之所謂世界和平，不外由英美兩國制覇世界，置亞細亞於其管理之下而已。軍事，經濟，政治以及文化一切的一切，均舞弄其惡辣手段，以圖維持，並强化自已之榨取侵略機構，其意在使世界屈服於自己勢力之下。更毫無疑義其不逞不遜之野心，已由大西洋憲章之宣布。</p>
<p>與歐盟邦共同奮鬥　對此制覇世界之野心，東亞各國，愈益憤激，誓死保衛東亞，並與歐洲盟邦互相提携，擊滅兇敵，以建立世界恒久之和平。於茲正踴躍參加決戰，吾人彼此之團結，愈益緊密，吾人之決意，愈益鞏固，戰局今已緊迫，大東亞與歐洲運命之重大決戰，倍加苛烈，敵方雖有豐富之物量，然爲掩飾其曖味之戰爭目的，保持其易亂之團結，正急於短期罷戰，故戰勢轉變之神機，實潛在此激烈之決戰階段中。眼前吾人實當以不退轉之精神力與强烈之勇猛心，把握戰機，果敢奮鬥，正義所趨，最後勝利必歸我，已毫無疑義也。</p>
<h3>日井口部長談　現階段戰局</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日情報局第三部長井口氏，於大東亞戰爭第三週年紀念日發表談話，說明現階段之戰局，日本戰爭目的及敵人之侵略政策，痛斥敵方英美爲戰爭責任者，原文如次：歷史上之空前大戰，目下依然繼續推進，因此人類文明爲之停止，甚至爲之逆行，不獨諸大貴重之文化事蹟因兵　化歸灰燼，即他日担當世界運命之有爲靑年，亦多喪失生命，然思此人類慘劇發生之根本原因，則應歸於妨害和平，欲制覇世界政治，經濟，只圖自國利益之英美兩國侵略政策，由開戰之經過觀之，益加明瞭。日本與大東亞各國團結，一意爲達成共同戰爭目的，破除彼等戰力，在彼等戰意未喪失前，決繼續作果敢之鬥爭。第一次世界大戰時，英美頻頻呼爲根絕戰爭之戰爭，然第一次戰爭之結果，反成更大戰爭之誘發原因，其責任最重者，當歸於當時戰勝者英美之制覇世界獨佔繁榮，追隨强權及排他利己之政策所致。尤其在東亞，英美不僅對殖民地强化榨取，更嗾使重慶政權對日作戰，以期中國分裂，東亞相尅，英美之大戰指導者，以此種政策復使世界陷於戰禍中，同時，使國國子弟作與自已生活毫無關係之戰急犧牲者，致仍陸續犧牲。相反者，日本之戰爭目的，已終去年大東亞宣言中具體表明，且最近重光外相之說明亦甚明顯，仍發於東亞民族之自衛與解放而起者，欲以各國之主權平等，經濟互惠，文化交流，而奠定世界和平之新基礎，因之，英美專制之機構及行使武力的理念，根本與日方不同。戰爭至現階段，雙方戰爭目的之本質對立已極明義，世界無論何人，均能認識此次戰爭責任者，當此之時，大東亞戰爭益趨有利於日方，在支持戰爭之各重要地械，漸趨制壓敵人，日本前綫與後方之士氣益趨昂揚，益能把握正義之戰爭信念，直向勝利之途邁進。</p>
<h3>正義之師　終必能獲勝</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　中國派遣軍報道部三品部長，於大東亞戰爭三週年紀念日之晚，特以「在中國大陸進行大東亞戰爭之中國派遣軍」爲題，由東京中央廣播電台作錄音廣播，茲誌大意如决：</p>
<p>英首相邱吉爾前曾放厥詞，公然謂在任何之世界中，正義未必能獲勝，此言之意味，即謂大義名分無諭如何顯明，戰爭未必誠能獲勝，且亦有戰敗之時。然則戰事之大義名分，果能彼此力量哲學所能簡單相撲乎。誠然以東西古今歷史而觀，正者未必獲勝，亦有失敗之時，惟此種塲合，正者曾似失敗，但實際並未被粉碎，質言之，即此種塲合敗北，僅爲現象方面的，在本質上固決不受其影響。茲試以世界歷史之變遷而觀，正義厥爲最後之勝利者，且此已成爲人類社會發展之原動力，是以絕對決定戰爭勝利者，實爲正義爲名分，其他可謂悉爲相對的。故如無大義名分，則戰爭絕難獲勝，縱獲勝利亦不過爲暫時之現象。歷史之鐵則已昭告我人，不正者終必失敗，毫無疑問，觀乎拿破崙曾稱覇全歐，恣意績行，然曾幾何時，終困死於聖赫那島。此次大東亞戰爭，乃爲古今罕見的大義名分之戰爭，其目的在打倒百年來壓迫東亞之盎格羅薩克遜帝國主義，謹在大東亞地域造成一純粹之東亞大同社會，以謀貢獻於世界和平之確立，此種偉大理想，實爲通古今行中外而不移之大義名分。茲大東亞戰爭已屆三周年，其間雖有許多現象的轉變，但日本每一國人之必勝信念更趨堅强者，實因國民全體已把握「正義不敗」之歷史的鐵則，而作爲民族的信仰也。</p>
<p>中日兩國，若不能永遠提携，則大東亞戰爭之名義，即始終爲空言。余現在所謂之中日提携，爲基於大東亞戰爭之大義名分者，此點絕非以覇道成權道，亦即謀略或小手段所能獲得者，乃爲基於王道行正道踏人大道，始能確保者。茲當大東亞戰爭三週年紀念日，謹表示駐華派遺軍將士堅持仁者無敵道義不滅之大道，鞏固必勝信念，與在太平洋與東南亞方面奮鬥之友軍，並肩向勝利之途邁進。</p>
<h3>大東亞戰爭　三年業狀況　岸情報部長廣播詞</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　（續昨）現在我們唯一應當知道的，是美人對他們自身的命運，未必俱有確信。美國商報雜誌六月號上，曾刋出一篇論文，指掛「日本在政治戰上已獲得勝利了」，在大東亞戰爭開始時，他們曾經自詡「將於三月以內獲得勝利」，可是在三年後的今日，却陷入了危境。他們又誇羅物資豐富，可是在北九洲被擊落的B29型機橡皮部分，乃是粗橡皮所製。澈底的說，如果我們苦，他們亦必同樣的苦，時至今日，實在是我們澈底擊滅驕敵英美，爭取勝利的唯一良機。因爲敵方愈接近日本本土，他們的補給綫愈延長，日方即愈得地利。現在日本的戰備，已經有備無患了，然而政忽者易籌大錯，敵方的物資我們也未能輕視，祇是戰爭之中戰意一點，又實在是勝敗的關鍵。日本神風特別攻擊隊的精神，的確不是英美的物質力量所能匹敵的。（完）</p>
<h3>對美機轟炸　日必施報復　小磯首相昨闡明決意</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　八日大東亞戰爭三周年紀念日之淸晨，日小磯首相於廣播演說中，關於美機轟炸東京事，曾披瀝一億國民之決意如决：抱有作戰到底之決心與必勝信念之我等日本國民，對敵美之此種轟炸，並無一人恐懼。敵人愈炸，吾人亦隨其炸彈之增加愈益堅定不屈不撓之決意，如果今後敵美敢將吾人尊崇之中心地域加以換害，則日本國民誓必對美國民施以辛辣之報復手段。</p>
<p>代論</p>
<h3>我們對於大東亞戰爭應有進一步的認識在上海「市民慶祝大會」　及「上海電台廣播」詞</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>我們來紀念大東亞戰爭，今天是第三次了。可是，這一次的紀念，正在決戰的時候，所以意義特別深長。過去三年間，盟邦日本軍民在大東亞戰爭中的功績，寄予萬分的敬佩。中國是大東亞戰爭中重要一員，我們對於戰爭所負的責任，以及如何協力究遂戰爭，已經講了很多，今天要講一講和平區內人民和重慶統治內人民應有的進一步認識。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，在太平洋上，敵美迭受巨創，最近侵菲的敵美海空軍，在盟邦英勇的陸海空部隊迎擊之下，已成了强努之末。印緬國境的敵英，則始終受着盟軍的克制。至於中國大陸，盟軍節節進展，現在突入貴州省境，重慶的處境益窘。這些光榮的戰績，有利的情勢，完全是獨擔大東亞戰爭中重任的盟邦軍民一致艱苦奮鬥所換來的代價。三年來我們在人力上和資源上貢獻於大東亞戰爭者，雖也不在少數，然而與盟邦的軍民相較，實在非常慚愧！大東亞戰爭的勝利，我們有充分的信心，但是，我們應該明白，敵人英美並不如此脆弱，還能作最後掙扎；同時，更加挾制重慶，驅策重慶，與我們爲敵，供其犧牲，這就增加了我們更多的困難，我們所負的責任也愈重。和平區內的同胞，大部分能認識到這種前途而致力於民族解放事業，然而也有一部分同胞忽略了如何做一個盡職的國民的意識，有在這方面喚醒的必要。</p>
<p>道個戰爭，是東亞民族求解放的戰爭，是決定中華民族爲主人爲奴隸的戰爭，凡是中國人不能置身於戰爭生活之外，必須生活在戰爭中。固然政府在這方面應亟謀努力之道。但是，我們每一個國民應進一步認織，民族的解放，必須全體民族都有獨立的自尊心，獨立的要求，然後才能有全體民族的解放。歷史的發展，是不斷的鬥爭，鬥爭不能脫離了現實，或者休息一會兒，等到合於自已興趣的時候再來努力。要知道，歷史的演進，不是直綫的，是曲綫式的，我們在任何一個時候採取了「明哲保身」的態度，或者「混水撈魚」的心理。在個人方面講，固然逃避了一時的艱難，或者一步登了天，瓦片翻了身，可是，直接間接削弱了或　喪了民族的元氣。如果不先求得民族的獨立自由，則個人一時的安逸和富貴，不僅是沙上高樓，相反的，由於我們對於民族的不忠實，不努力，增加了下一代的責任和艱難。戰爭到於艱苦決戰的時候，全民族一致奮起的時候，希望和平區內各階層的同胞以民族的利益爲利益，致力於民族解放的大事業，也即協力大東亞戰爭完遂勝利。</p>
<p>全中國人民應該站在一起努力的，對於和平區內同胞如此希望；但是，對於重慶統治下的同胞，我現在有着更大的期待。我很同情你們不能自由發展抱負的苦衷，我們相信你們中必有不少人已經能了解全面和平的眞義，而願意跑向我們這邊來，現在祗是受着環境的限制，不能表現出來。但是，這種苦悶，我相信終有一天會替你們解除的，祇要你們能够堅定，多抱你們求全面和平的願望設法影響到別人，一致督促重慶當局覺悟，完成和平，建立眞正獨立的國家。</p>
<p>不過，了解全面和平的眞義的人固然一定不少，可是目前還是受着重慶妄目拖戰所迷惑的人，恐怕還很多，對於這些人，我要誠懇地要求你們快些覺悟。日本早已和中國訂立平等的條約，並早已實際放棄了在華由英美所遺下來的各種特權，並已交還租界，和平區內除作戰部隊外，我們已獲得完全的自主。反之，重慶現在則明顯的是爲英美尤其美國所控制，拖戰徒然替英美做工具，拖戰徒然替共黨擴張勢力，而老百姓則愈拖愈苦，國家則愈拖戰元氣愈喪失。同時事實又很明白的擺在眼前，渝軍節節敗退，日軍現在進達貴州省境，你們八年多來所希望於重慶爲民族獨立解放的「抗戰」，現在可以證明完全失敗了，把你們拖到比以前更不如的殖民地的地位上去了。日末方面聲明不以重慶人民爲敵，在湖南，廣西，以及現在的貴州，日本方面的誠意，你們比我在上海更淸楚了吧？重慶能否獲得勝利，在這次的敗退中，你們比我在上海更了解了吧？這許多事實放在你們面前，你們應該正視現實，不要爲英美片面宣傳所蒙蔽。你們應該快些覺悟，跟巳經覺悟了的人携起手來督促重慶當局速下決心，停止拖戰，助成全面和平。重慶是靠你們老百姓做支柱才能存在的，只要你們都能够覺悟，那末，支柱失去了，拖戰分子也必無能爲力。和平區內和重慶治下的人民，請大聯合起來吧。</p>

<h3>朂勉全東亞民族繼續推進總力戰　國府陳代主席昨廣播演講</h3>
<p>南京八日中央社電　國府陳代主席爲大東亞戰爭三週紀念，於八日晚九時二十分，假中央電台，向全國國民及全東亞同志廣播，勗勉努力前進，原詞如决：</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的爆發，到現在已經是整整的三年了。在過去三年當中，東亞各國家民族一致奮起，結集總力，前綫後方，凝成一體，在保衛東亞建設東亞的共同目標之下，積極邁進，這是亞洲自有歷史以來，亞洲民族爲共同的生存與發展而發動的最大鬥爭。</p>
<p>百餘年來，亞洲各國曾經發生過無數的戰爭，那些戰爭不是帝國主義者分別的，或聯合的向我們進攻，亞洲民族不過零零碎碎的起而反抗，終致爲所欺凌，受其蹂躪，便是爲帝國主義者所挑撥離間，釀成自相殘殺之慘局。使帝國主義者更得以乘間伺隙，　食我土地，掠奪我資源，奴役我同胞。祇有這一次，全亞洲國家民族，以共同的目標，爲共同的行動，一致奮起，爲排除侵略主義而戰，爲共同防衛而戰，爲共同生存而戰．</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭從消極方面說，是驅逐亞洲百餘年來的共同宿敵英美侵略主義者，以爭取全東亞民族的解放。從績極方面說，也以東亞民族本然的道義結合，以建設東亞永久共存共榮的新天地。所以這一次大規模的空前決鬥，意義是非常重大的。</p>
<p>建設獨立自主國家　中國自鴉片戰爭以來，即日漸的淪爲茼美侵路主義者的次殖民地，沿海港口，幾乎完全爲所覇佔，成爲英美侵略主義經濟侵略的橋頭堡。其他許多都巿，也一一開關租界，建築其政治文化侵略的基地。物力的資源也多所奴役剝削。全國同胞一直忍辱含垢，在不平等條約的束縛之下，過着奴隸牛馬的非人生活，直至國父孫先生倡導國民革命，才展開綿綿不絕的反侵略的民族獨立鬥爭，國民革命之目的求中國的自由平等，同時求亞洲各國之獨立解放，欲达到此目的，必須喚起民衆及聯合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奮鬥，祇有這样，才能够對內打倒封建殘餘勢力，對外打倒帝國主義者的侵略勢力。才能够發揮舉國的民力國力，聯結同利害共生死的與國爭回主人的地位，以建立一個獨立自主的現代國家。並以建立一個相倚相扶的國家集團。全國同胞爲此而犧牲的血汗，不可謂不多，爲此而從事的鬥爭，不可謂不烈。五六十年來，國家民族所以能够不陷入瓜分共管的厄運，所以能够在萬般困苦中，爭取國際地位之增進，都是由於全國同胞在這不斷的鬥爭中，不斷的犧牲，不斷的流血，而換取得來。然而一國團結的力量，不够强大，對內統一未臻鞏固時，爲帝國主義者挑撥操縱，以至意見紛岐內鬥時起。再因外交的方針舉棋不定，對外結盟無從樹立，支離混雜，外患煎迫，遂使狡獪的英美帝國主義者，得以施展威迫利誘，桃撥離間的種種陰謀。國民革命一起一伏，橫受挫折，而不幸的中日事變，亦由於這內在的，以及外來的矛盾所激成而起。道是在大東亞戰爭發展到了今天，我們所不由得不回想起來的前鏖舊事。</p>
<p>東亞一家同生共死　帝國者厲行侵略的手段，一是武力的壓迫，使人不敢反抗，一是陰險的播弄，使人不能反抗。對印度如此，對緬甸如此，對南洋各地如此，對中國如此，對整個東亞亦復如此。因此反侵略的戰略，不僅在於防禦侵略者的武力，而尤在於杜絕侵略者陰險狡詐的毒計，必如是乃能厚集所有必要的和可能的力量，以從事於必勝不敗的鬥爭，這個原則，就中國來說，必須做到黨不可分，國必統一，而後中國之自由平等，可以確保。就東亞來說，也必須做到東亞一家，同生共死，而後決戰之勝利可期，共榮之建設可成。</p>
<p>六年以來，我們在汪主席領導之下，致力於私平建國運動，其基本理念，即在於統一之黨，統一之國，謀統一之和平，亦即在於先恢復中日邦交，進而緊密協力，共應世變。由安定東亞而貢獻於世界的和平，雖然歲月蹉跎，統一未成，和平未立，而我們的願望，始終如一。我們的努力，曾不稍懈。到了大東亞戰爭，由於盟邦日本挺身而起，一方面祖任保衛東亞的前鋒，一方面薪致東亞民族的團結，中日事變旣一變而爲保衛東亞的戰爭，國民革命的本來面目，由此可以完成，和平遝動的基本理念，由此愈見光明。我們的願望因此有了實現的機會，我們的努力，也因此更得到了着手之所在，所以在大東亞戰爭爆發後不久，國民政府就毅然決然的宣戰。我們深知欲求中國的自由平等，這是千載一時的關鍵，奮發爲雄，不能後人。我們更知東亞的安定，東亞民族各自的生存，和共同的生存，都繫此一戰。良機不能坐失，所以義無反顧，沒有一人躊躇。這三年間，盟邦日本以其全部的精兵實力，担任鬥爭的前鋒，與敵在彊塲週旋，業已獲得赫赫的戰果。東亞其他各友邦，也無不相　奮起，舉其所有的人力與物力，或則前仆後繼，與暴敵短兵接戰，或則協力盟邦，克盡後方的重責，因此大東亞戰爭進展到最高潮的現階段，全東亞民族的鬥志，是日益蓬勃昂揚起來，保衛東亞的軸心，也日益擴大，日益堅强起來了。</p>
<p>最後勝利必屬於我　大東亞戰爭旣爲全東亞民族解放的戰爭，我們就祇有下革命的決心，配合緊密的行動，以全般的總力，生產不息，作誓死的決鬥。唯有革命的決心，才能够堅定必勝的信念，唯有緊密的行動，才能够排除一切的困難。全東亞有十億的戰鬥隊伍，有無比的龐大物力，有鞏固的海洋要塞，有廣大的大陸基地，運之於革命的決心與行動，則最後的勝利必屬於我，毫無疑義。現在戰局也許還要一起一伏的延展下去，然而戰局愈延展，我們的鬥爭態劇烈，因之我們的勝利也就愈接近，愈確實，而愈有把握。</p>
<p>在這樣的情勢之下，中國的前途究竟怎樣呢？我曾經說過，「無論任何國家，要想圖存，要想復興，最靠得住的辦法，是靠自己。自己努力之途徑甚多，而最要之點則旣爲參戰的國家，即有參戰國的責任，同時即應盡參戰國之義務。我們能否從大東亞戰爭中求得自由平等，確保自由平等，首先要看我們對於大東亞戰爭負起多少責任，盡了多少義務。</p>
<p>促進和平搶救重慶　以現局面論，鞏固後方，供應前方，粉碎敵人之殘餘勢力，使之放棄其再侵略東亞之野心爲第一要着。促進和平統一，搶救重慶，使之擺脫英美的覇絆爲又一要着。怎樣才能鞏固後方呢？汪主席訓示過：（一）要肅正思想，（二）要確立治安，（三）要安定民生。怎樣才能够供應前方呢？（一）要增加生產，（二）要節約消費。我們於此，過去曾有過不斷的努力，今後更當加倍的努力。至於和平統一，搶救重慶，和平的障碍何在，統一的困難何在，重慶的苦悶何在，這又都是我們所當深思熟慮，共謀衝破的。</p>
<p>在大東亞戰爭第四年度開始的今天，我們瞻望着前途的光明，不禁想起汪主席在生之日，不斷給予我們的訓。遺我們深信汪主席先知先覺的指示，及其偉大人格的感召，必能使我全國同胞永矢不忘。我們誓必繼承遺志，以貫澈和平運動的初衷，而完成大東亞戰爭，興華保亞之使命。全中國的同胞們，全亞洲的同志們，光明在我們的面前，我們前進吧。</p>

<h3>日軍攻陷龍州　打通桂越國境　縱貫大陸動脈即將完成</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日軍於十一月二十四日攻陷南寗後，更繼續進繫，頃已迫近越南國境。又另一方面越南日軍亦於十一月末開始向廣西省內進攻，其右翼部隊三十日已攻陷明江，左翼部隊十二月三日已攻陷龍州（南寗與越南國境間之要塞），因之渝軍國境防衛態勢全面紊亂。當日軍進攻桂柳地區時，重慶軍當局曾謂調遣國境守備軍至桂柳戰域應戰，故該方面則陷空虛，因之日軍遂乘虛而入，於突破國境綫後，更深入廣西省內，以與南下之日軍會師。重慶陣營對此次攻勢，於前次衡陽作戰方酣之際，曾謂「日軍作戰意岡，在　北京經漢口至廣東，達成其蜿蜒兩千公里縱斷大陸之長城綫」，但此次由於日華南軍與越南方面軍將行會師，則日軍北自釜山·奉天·北京·漢口·長沙·衡陽·桂林·南寗，更進而達河內，經盤谷至昭南，全長五千公里之日軍戰略大動脈即將完成在即。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　縱貫中國大陸作戰中之華南日軍及越南方面日軍，觀其進展，兩軍於最近將可會師，大陸縱斷鐵道亦逐漸達實現之期。爲大陸縱貫鐵道之打通，日議會業於去年在八田鐵相之計劃案內說明，至實現問題尚須相當時日。然經調查後，知其於極短期間內亦可實現。蓋日軍一旦打通大陸後，工事即可着手，因大陸縱貫鐵道幹綫，係以東京爲起點，經過釜山·奉天·北京，復由京漢綫到達漢口，下接粵漢綫，經株州·衡陽·至柳州·南寗，並自鎭南關而入越南通河內，復經塔那浦·撃谷，而達終點昭南。其第二綫係由東京至長崎，經海路而達上海，通金華·南昌·株州，與第一綫連接。第一綫東京至昭南間之距離爲一萬八百七十公里，須時九日十三時，第二綫上海至昭南間之距離爲五千二百公里，須四日廿三小時，自東京起則須六日廿三小時。現尚未完成部份，爲中國境內之柳州至鎭南關間之六百四十公里，及越南境內塔那浦。臺塔凱克間之二百公里，合計僅八百四十公里。中國方面就地形而觀，建設工程上可無問題，越南國境內雖有安南山脈橫阻，然無困難，隧道工程倘若着手建設，最遲一年內亦可吿成。此路完成後，敵航空遊擊則喪其威力，而日本土與南方諸地域之交通亦可暢通，運輸當可增强，故實爲完成大東亞戰爭上之一大業也</p>

<h3>蘇崑虞產米區視察記（三）</h3>
<p>二田賦實物徵收</p>
<p>中國的田賦自古至明朝，是實施實物徵收，像漢代以農民所得十五分之一作爲稅則，到唐朝實行租庸調制，徵收米（租）絹·綾·繪（調）力役或折漢絹（庸）直到明英宗三年（離今五〇七年）始令折徽金花銀，以後就改成金·銀·法幣等通貨交付田賦。</p>
<p>江蘇省政府，本年度花物價變動非常劇烈時，改田賦爲實物徵收，一，以維持省政府財政開支，二，維持省方軍警用米，本年度田賦微收額預定爲六十六萬石，是根據昨年度現金繳納田賦折合實物徵收，其預定額，的達江蘇省耕地全面積算出田賦總額的四成。徵取後預定以三分之一作爲省軍警用米，由省府討論支配，其他三分之二，原則上售於米統會，希望以安定省內四大城市之民生作配給米之用。</p>
<p>徵收田賦數量，平均在常熟每畝一斗；農民替代田主繳交手續，農民田賦交米於分徵收處領臨時收據。由地租扣除與繳納田賦用當的金額，然後將臨時收據與地租金額同時捐出，掉換正式收據。</p>
<p>在常熟方面，便實施田賦，田租，收買食米三位統一性措置，其辦法業呈財政應備案，其要綱及步驟爲，一，農民平均每畝四斗作爲收買量，二，農民以每畝一斗繳田賦，三，以收據及租金額（扣取田賦米價）交田主。所收的田賦折價出售米統會，以一半歸縣府支配，一半解省。</p>
<p>大關田賦實物徵收最大關鍵，是否於農民交付省府之間，有吾浮收，滯納，中飽，侵蝕等弊病，記者團曾以此問題，詢問省府，據省府代表稱：「當局自當儘可能防止之，並以聯單「一份四聯」爲憑，由各縣縣府直接負責。同時嚴密監督，不使滋生流弊」，</p>
<p>據視察所得歸納以下三點，以吿當局：</p>
<p>一，據開賦稅分徵收處於實物徵收時，有用大枰（二十四兩秤），以致農民交納田賦一斗，實際交出需一斗五升，農民損失太大。</p>
<p>二，江蘇當局所規定的罰款，如「滯納金」即田賦征收，農民於規定時間後交納，即需罰款，數目達田賦十分之一，農民對此頗爲苦痛，希望廢除「滞納金」辦法，代以獎勵方法，使農民早日完糧</p>
<p>三，常熟產棉區地帶，所交繳田賦，亦以米一斗計算，或以一斗米之黑市價格交付田賦分征所，由彼等代爲購米完糧，（記者因曾以此問題詢問常熟王縣長，彼否認此事，然據梅李鎮田賦分征所副主任，確稱，業已實行）農民所收穫之棉花以公定價售出，然而，交繳田賦，需依黑巿米價購買或依此代價交出，未免稍欠公平。</p>
<p>關係當局旣　稱，米糧已非商品，列爲戰爭中後方重要資源，那麽農民就是從事生產的戰士，農民一面交出收買米糧，供軍需和民需之用，一面交納田賦，維持軍警官吏的配給米，依理，對農民應加以敬愛之心，實際上，農民所負苛雜捐稅之重，令人吐舌，希望當局今後多多爲農民着想，別以田賦取之於農民，而對於農民生活處境則漠不關心，同時對目前地方政治的下層機構，以及接觸農民層之保甲行政負責者，應加以剔除工作，重加高度革新，以不負農民之殷切期待。</p>
<p>三　田租問題</p>
<p>蘇州地區，據當局報告，田主佔擁田總額百分之七十，自耕農僅佔百分之三〇，由此而觀，田租有關民生，並不比買米爲次要。</p>
<p>常熟方面農民與田主所訂租金，依向來習慣，爲每畝八斗至一石間，本年度因收成稍差，以對折合黑市米價而定，在當時折算約每畝自三千元至四千元之間，至於原田地原田主交付，現因實物徽收，由農民替代交納，例如農民與田主訂的每畝四千元租金，農民歲繳田賦一斗，依黑市價計算，倘黑市米價爲一萬元一石，一斗爲一千元，則農民以田賦臨時收據述三千元租金，交付地主。</p>
<p>地主方面，以前治安尚無確立時，壓根兒無田租可收，這次有相當田租收入，常甚滿意。</p>
<p>常熟擁有田之業王，組織田業公會，和採辦商站在同一陣綫，協助收買米糧工作，在原則上固然很好，可是暗中難免或有榨取農民之危險。</p>
<p>過去，農民所負擔的，單純祗有田賦和田租，目前且直待負起戰時體制下軍需民需的重任，因此，對依賴田地的寄生者－－田主的權利，應嚴格的加以限止，倘有必要時，規定田租數額，或因歉收關係，免去農民所負之田租負擔。</p>
<p>四　本年度米糧收穫</p>
<p>本年度米糧收穫，據江蘇辦事處調查發表：「本年夏季估計蘇州地區收檴甚豐，惟自五月起，陰雨連綿，於秋季又遭螟蟲侵蝕，收成略有損失，但以全盤而論，尚比去年爲佳。」</p>
<p>以蘇，崑，虞而論，蘇州尚佳，常熟不免受螟蟲所累，略有影響，崑山一二區收成不良，三，八，十，十一區，較可，江蘇地區早稻晚稻收穫尚佳，中稻不免有相當損害。</p>
<p>至於螟蟲之害全由於昨年冬季尚未大寒，農民又未將泥土翻動，以致蟲仔未被撲滅，於秋季滋畏成蟲，潛伏於稻基內，吸收營養成份，使稻不易結實。</p>
<p>因爲本年米糧收成，各地並不一致，因此有三點值得注意者：</p>
<p>一，目前收買米糧，依每畝計算，有一定數額，但亦有幾處歉收，對於歉收區域的收買量，應加以考慮，予以折扣，否則，這一視同仁的分擔制，於實施時，不大合適。、</p>
<p>二，本年爲　汪故主席所領導的增產年，可是眞能實踐這增產運動，祗有合作社在努力外，其他機構，並不如此，甚至對農村的生產，緘默而　視，這是很遺憾的，本年度有幾處是歉收，其中天災蟲害，固難避免，但有的所在，因爲地方政治情况不良，以致影響生產，這是當局應該警惕的。</p>
<p>三，崑山自本年九月一日起，爲鄕村建設實施委員會指定的鄕村建設實騐區之一，適是時螟蟲飛境，在朝高談建設鄉村之袞袞諸公，高唱建設口號，紙上計劃增產例件之時期中，農民恰與螟蟲搏鬥於田野，僅合作社人員予以領導，未能普遍防止，效果減少以致崑山受害較重，此點在朝諸公，何以對待經歷苦戰而歸失敗之農民，而能問心無愧　？</p>

<p>市民慶祝大會吉田東祐演辭</p>
<p>紀念大東亞戰爭三周年市民慶祝大會中，吉田東祐演辭全文如下：</p>
<p>爲什么要慶祝</p>
<p>今天是大東亞戰爭第三週年紀念日，我很榮幸參加在這里開的上海市民慶祝大會。但是，我很冒昧的問問各位，爲什么時候麼我們今天要慶祝大東亞戰爭呢？在這樣的機會，我提起這麼不成問題的問題，當然自己知道太失了禮貌了，但我有我的理由。因爲我猜想在座的各位當中，一定有這樣想法的人，就是說，我們中國人想　不要慶祝大東亞戰爭。大東亞戰爭三年來，我們得到的是什麼？大東亞戰爭開始以前，上海的米價一像不過一千塊錢，但是到了今天，米價漲到三萬塊錢了，三年以前的今日貪官汚吏有是有的，但沒有今天這樣利害，現在大規模的貪官汚吏不必談，上海馬路上，我們隨時隨地到處看得到小規模的貪官汚吏。三年以前的今天，物價的「黑市」有是有的，但是根本沒有現在這樣普遍，現在看電影響有黑市票，坐火車有黑市票，坐飛機也有黑市，米當然有黑市米。老實說，現在無論什麼不拿黑市的現價錢，就根本什麼東西了。「黑市」是現在我們可以買東西的唯一的市塲了，這樣的現象，都是大東亞戰爭開始以來的結果，實在現在的上海特別市本身成爲一個「大黑市了」。</p>
<p>德國的某戰爭理論家說過一句話：「戰爭是政治的延長。」假使這一句話是對的，大東亞戰爭打勝利的時候，目前這樣的政治要延長的話，那麼我們更不得了啊！是不是我們還是要慶祝大東亞戰爭呢？這樣想法是相當有道理的，很有理由的。但是我說我們還是要慶祝大東亞戰爭，這個說法怎麼行呢？根據甚麼理由，請各位讓我說明一下。</p>
<p>日本人的覺悟</p>
<p>有人說虎爭本來是特質的消化，戰爭時期，社會上發生經濟問題，是免不了的。所以單純的經濟的困難不要說，我也承認這個說法，但是因爲政治不上執道而發生的經濟上的混亂，是大有問題了。戰爭時期民衆應該吃苦的，吃苦不吃苦是不成問題。大部份的民衆在饑餓綫上的進候，一部分的少數人們生活闊的了不得，不做甚麼工作出入有汽車，天天吃大菜。這樣的現象，是不應該的。假使國家裏有這矛盾很利害的話，國民不能打得一片，結果那個國家當然不能打勝仗的。那麼大東亞戰爭開始以來，中日兩國有沒有這種現象呢？有的，的確是有的，一批中國的壞蛋，同日本無朝份子勾結起來，很密切的中日含作之下，發國難財的是不少了。這樣事情我不必多談，固爲大家沒有人不知道的。但是在座的各位，這裏有大家不知道的或者很少知道的，大東亞戰爭的另一方面的發展，另外一個新的發展，就是什麼東西？大東亞戰爭開始以來，很多日本人已經覺悟到「假如我們要打倒英美的話，我們非要消滅這種現象不可」我們　這種現象馬馬虎虎過去的話，大東亞戰爭的勝利絕對談不到，什麼政治革新不想倣造，也可以得到勝利，大東亞戰爭並不　　容易的戰爭。日本的自覺份子，和中國的自覺份子團結起來，解決社會上　　的矛盾現象，打倒壞的中日合作，大東亞戰爭才有辦法，才有勝利的。</p>
<p>中日真誠合作</p>
<p>可能這樣想法的日本人，一天比一天多起來了。大東亞戰爭開始以來，日本人的想法，的確有這樣的改變，所以日本人對中國的根本想法，也完全不比從前了。從前大多數的日本人差不多都看不見中國人，但是現在很多的日本人已經覺悟到，沒有中國人的衷心的協力，大東亞戰爭決不會有好結果，假如要得到中國人的衷心的動務，日本人應該實實在在尊重中國的獨立自由。在日本人方面的事種覺悟，當然在中國人心裏頭不會沒有反着的了。從前對於中日合作的問題，一點沒有與趣的中國人，現在對於中日合作，對於全面和平，表示相當的熱情。他們想假如大東亞戰爭開始以來，日本人當中實在有這樣的想法的人一天比一多天起，中日合作是有希望的，我們中國人對日本人的看法，應該要改一改的。最近我看到中日丙國人士的心裏上的確有這樣新的發展，這個新的發展是很寶貴的，因爲我相信這個新的精神上的發展，是將來的中日真誠合作的基確。大東亞戰爭的進行中，我相信日本人這樣的覺悟，一天比一天要深刻了。那麼中國人對日本人的了解，更加進步，更加改變，兩國的見解一步一步接近起一。這樣下去，這個戰爭的最後一天，我相信中日的真誠合作。可以達到了，中日的真誠合作成功的話，打倒英美帝國主義，是毫無問題的，假使英美帝國主義打倒的話，全大東亞民族的解放是毫無問題的，中國的獨立自由也毫無問題的，所以大東亞爭的開始的那一天，就是世界史上這樣的大變動開始的那一天。因之，我們的目前困難不論怎樣大，我不能不主張我們仍應該慶祝。</p>

<p>中國代表致詞</p>
<p>「今天是十二月八日，在三年前的今日，就是日本斷然向英美宣戰發動大東亞戰爭的時候，大東亞民族的解放運動，從此進入一個劃時代的新時期，大東亞各民族亦從此逐一奮起，而排除英美女的壓迫，到了今日，大東亞每一個民族，都已負起了戰爭的使命，以求最後決勝。最近台灣與菲律賓的大海空戰，以及在雷伊泰島的登陸作戰，敵美不知犧牲了多少海軍空軍將士，其所得的唯一代價，不過是換得了羅斯福的第四屆當選。可是菲律賓的面積旣大，防衛森嚴，敵美冒險作此嘗試，也就是造成本身覆滅的機會。敵人雖頑強，當亦難逃這個已定的惡運。我們今天在這兒召開大東亞民族聯合戰綫總動員運動，在求大東亞戰爭的勝利，凡是大東亞各民族，以及各個人各團體，都應該用最大的力量來推進。東亞民族的存亡是在今日的一戰，不能再容我們有偷生畏死的今頭，希望東亞同胞，共同努力邁進。」</p>
<p>日本代表致詞</p>
<p>「解放東亞的聖戰，已經過了三年了，這大東亞戰爭跟歐洲大戰，而波及全球，也就是把世界的公敵英美消滅的聖戰，是把東亞從英美的魔手中求解放的烽火，深遠的天意和歷史的必然性，正在幫助着我們擊滅英美解放東亞的偉業。回想大東亞戰爭以來三年間的情勢變化，突在有滄海桑田之感，不但已搶回了英美的領土殖民地，在這些地域中，待望了三百年的獨立國家繼續的建立，在大東亞戰爭發生當時，只有中日滿泰獨立國，而到了三年後的今天呢！先有菲律賓和緬甸，更加上印度獨立臨時政府的成立，荷印也快獨立了，這些偉大的成就，在三年前的今天，有誰能豫想得到呢？大東亞戰爭的爆發，日本從頭到尾是站在被動的地位的，是不得已的，可以說是賭國家於興亡的奮戰，所以過去三年戰爭可謂相當波瀾曲折的苦戰，現今正是和西歐大戰並肩擊滅英美的時候了。在太平洋方面，日本軍隊屢建奇功，士氣益盛，生產方面亦漸次增高，可胃物心兩面，完全是決戰體制，這一點由於最近臺灣海空戰和雷伊泰島的大戰果，已足够證明了，同時歐洲方面的戰局，亦轉有利於德國，換一句話說，東亞的勝利，就在一步的跟前了，東亞必勝體制已成功了，諸位爲了勝利，爲了道義世界的建設，一同奮起吧！現在正是東亞十萬萬蹶起的時候，起來吧。」</p>
<p>滿洲代表致詞</p>
<p>「大東亞戰爭，不是親邦日本一國對英美的戰爭，是大東亞各民族聯合奮起共同殲滅宿敵美英的戰爭，新邦日本的陸海空軍，不分晝夜在前綫上奮鬥，最近雷伊泰灣的海虎特攻隊的白刃戰，英勇神武，以體當先，實使槍後的東亞各民族不勝感銘之至。最後勝利的基礎，已經奠定了，東亞各憶族愈應緊密聯合，大同團結起來，鞏固槍後的總力，供給官民協力堅強必勝信念，確保戰爭資源。東亞全面和平和大東亞共存共榮，安居樂業的日子，在最近的將來就可以實現了。」</p>

<h3>大東亞戰爭第二年記</h3>
<p>— 晚子（昨續）</p>
<p>波根維爾島六次大戰</p>
<p>波島是所羅門羣島中最大的島嶼，它是日本南方海軍根據地拉巴爾的屏障。自十月下旬起至十二月初在該島方面的六次海空戰，誠爲本年度最酷烈的戰事。美方對於該役戰事，確有充份準備，曾把地中海方面的海軍調至該區，形勢浩大，十月二十日美軍首先是空襲，繼在摩諾島登陸，波島南端要塞受到絕大威脅。日方自十月底起，即全力以赴，施以強烈轟炸。</p>
<p>俾斯麥島戰事</p>
<p>俾斯麥羣島在所羅門的西北，中有兩個大島：　新不列顛島，　新愛爾蘭島。美軍初於十月後不斷空襲新不列島西北角的拉巴爾；十二月十五日在馬加斯岬登陸；更於二十五日進擊新愛爾蘭島。</p>
<p>新幾內亞戰事</p>
<p>六月三十日，美軍那索灣登陸，日方以寡兵抗戰，美兵死傷在五千六百以上。九月四日美軍復在霍當即協力出動攻擊，機動戰術，予以重創。雙方復在新幾內亞上空展開熾烈空戰。</p>
<p>（二）中太平洋方面</p>
<p>吉爾貝特羣島海空虞</p>
<p>十一月下旬，美軍大舉往該羣島方面進襲，連續發生四次海空戰。美方以空母集團爲中心，該役犧牲重大，美軍計傷亡三千七百餘名，空母被沉七艘，驅逐艦一，巡洋艦二。日在該羣島中的瑪金，與泰拉瓦兩島的守軍及軍屬計四千五百名，全部殉國。</p>
<p>馬紹爾島海面空戰</p>
<p>十二月五日美機動部隊艦上飛機來襲該羣島日軍陣地，被擊落二十架，是日晚，日將該機動部隊包圍，予以殲滅，二十一日美機又來空襲，捐失退去。</p>
<p>（三）北太平洋方面</p>
<p>美國對於北太平洋的侵進路綫極爲重視。在一九四二年中，已完成阿拉斯加公路和橫斷加拿大公路，目增強北太平洋如荷蘭港，西特加等各基地，圖謀由此進窺日本本土，日軍不甘落後，於是年六月中攻佔基斯加及阿圖島以謀牽制。</p>
<p>一九四三年美在阿拉斯加，阿留申羣島積極增兵，並數度發動海空軍，削斷日方補給綫。日方在基。阿兩島固守陣地。</p>
<p>五月十二日，美在阿圖島登陸，日守軍予以重創後，孤軍苦戰凡三十日，山崎部隊遂全體殉國。</p>
<p>美復於六月中竭力轟炸基斯加島。七月七旬，日軍以千島羣島等北區工事業已完成，遂在該島安全撤退。美於八月中往日本最北端的北千島空襲，殊無成就，十月十四日，日則奇襲阿圖島，破壞其軍事設施。</p>
<p>（四）緬甸方面</p>
<p>緬甸是中國西南的屏障，亦爲印度的緩衡地帶，實爲英美所必爭。否則緬甸失去，印度洞開，援助重慶的力量就不充分。日本在一九四二年給予英印軍反攻打擊極大，復向　爾溫江猛進，建立強固陣地；繼而在八月一日實行解放緬甸，使之獨立建國。</p>
<p>五月十三日，日軍於印緬過境擊退，二萬英軍確保陣地；更越過險峻高山，在中國雲南邊境佔據騰越，拉孟等處。英軍不獲已，乃一味致力於防衛印度；重慶軍隊則艱苦地從事亽爭奪滇緬路綫。</p>
<p>十二月下旬，英印軍曾以優勢啊隊，不斷向阿恰布竺地攻擊，日軍予以擊潰，日軍且繞至阿拉坎山奇襲，英印軍退躚疲截，捐失不貲；日陸軍航空隊更出動猛炸印度東部以相呼應。阿拉坎一役英印軍捐失四千二百人。</p>
<p>在印緬邊境日軍擊潰英印軍主力之後，即進佔布共頓及孟多。</p>
<p>八月羅邱奎北克會談後，頗有「奪回緬甸」的呼聲，日軍爲先發制人計，乃於十月十五日直入冷水溝，十七日對鎖薩爾溫（怒）江橋頭堡，完成大包聞戰。重慶增派遠征軍三十五萬至雲南，另外空中輸運精銳五萬至印度東部，加強英美防綫，日軍則自寗芝那出發，運用機動戰，進攻英渝軍正面並側面，形成大包圍的形勢。</p>
<p>至一九四三年終，英印軍在布其頓方面亦有所行動，都被擊潰。</p>
<p>（五）中國方面</p>
<p>英美在大東亞戰爭中敗北後，亟思利用中國大陸以牽制日軍，作爲總反攻的基地。幾次在中國大陸上重要的戰事列下：</p>
<p>一，日軍於二月十六日晨，在雷州半島雷洲　實行登陸。</p>
<p>二，二月下旬，日軍在海南島方面作戰。</p>
<p>三，二月三月間在湖北洞庭湖之北及江蘇蘇淮地區作戰。</p>
<p>四，四月以後在營，察，冀三省作戰。重慶第二十四集團軍長龐炳勛及孫殿英等參加和運。</p>
<p>五，三月至五月下旬爲發展宜昌長江航路作戰</p>
<p>六，五月上旬以後在洞庭湖西方地區等作戰。</p>
<p>七，七月上旬起在山西省太行山作戰：九月後在華北各地剿共作戰。</p>
<p>八，十月至十二月佔據常德作戰。（完）</p>
<p>前方浴血奮戰，　後方節衣縮食。　許壽光</p>
<p>誓以鐵，誓以血，　誓以鐵血滅英美！　周淑眞</p>

<h3>大東亞戰爭三周年紀念歌以致祝</h3>
<p>— 東光甲</p>
<p>漢擊匈奴漢始強。晋容五胡晋遂亡。武侯若不平南蠻。五師焉能出祁山。自古安內先攘外。異族終爲民族害。清季孱王昧時局。碧眼黃鬚恣所欲。百餘年來跋扈久。昔爲罪魁今戎首。太平洋上戰船開。驚濤駭浪逼人來。自恃強權操勝算。豈知好戰有奇災。東鄰盟邦仗義。誓與吾族同生死。聯印制英菲制美。三年血虎摧敵壘。支持文化五千年。凈掃腥羶四萬里。保全東亞實賴此。嗟乎。完遂戰爭非偶然。惟恃吾族信念堅。但使組織能健全。巍巍勝利在眼前。十億民筆劉動員。誓與頑敵相財旋。左執鞭　右棄鍵。突破彈雨與硝烟。寶刀閃灼戰血鮮。安內攘外嗣前賢。亞東重見光明天。自由花好加萬萬年。</p>

<h3>大東亞戰爭第三年</h3>
<p>— 鄭傳年</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭發動以來，已經歷整整三個年頭。日本在以往的戰歷，爲夏威夷珍珠港奇襲戰，馬來亞海戰，佔領香港戰，菲律賓海戰，婆辦洲海戰，新加坡攻略虎，印緬戰役，所羅門三次海戰，珊瑚海戰，強襲中途島，波根維爾六次海空戰，吉爾貝特四次海空戰，……每次呀役，無不戰果赫赫，確立了不敗的態勢，給予英美以迎痛擊。英美在過去也曾避重就細穩紥穩打的戰略，然而到了現在，因他們在軍事上政治上各方面的要不得，已經表露了最焦急的形態，美國在政略上的「東亞超過歐洲海」在目前已急遽抬頭，正怱忙於太平洋上的總反攻，他們每每宣傳「到東京之路不止一條，」日本却好整以順，各方面予以邀擊。</p>
<p>他們總反攻之路：第一條是由阿留申羣島方面的北方路綫。由於地勢氣候關係，此路不通；第二條是由蘇聯進攻日本之路。日本與蘇聯一逕保持友好關係，外交形勢不變，那是他們的單想思；第三條是向蘇門答臘，馬來亞一直到越南的反攻路綫，遙長迂迴，殊屬不利‘　第四條是由印緬發動，無異是孤軍衝出重圍，事與願違。第五條是向爪哇婆羅洲的反攻綫，第六條是澳洲新幾內亞而至菲律賓台灣直登中國南方大陸之路，另外則是由馬紹爾羣島而指馬利亞納與菲律賓台灣呼應的第攻條攻略綫。後二條最爲適合，由麥克沃塞及尼米資麾下領導之下，正作劇烈的主力艦隊接觸的戰鬥，一方面並空襲日本本土，加強效果。</p>
<p>近一年來，美方驅慢真不可一世，六月中粗魯地運用其機動部隊，在塞班島大宮島和迭尼安島帛流島登陸作戰，雖僥倖獲得成功，却犧牲重大，但有得不償失之槪。該數役美國前後捐失人員計有六萬之多。日軍奮勇搞戰，給予重大攻擊，塞班作戰，亘四十日之久，大宮及迭尼安則延長爲七十日，終以全體殉國，給予大東亞各國以極大的感動興奪。日本主力爲戰略關係，以極穩重的態度，侍機而動，未有輕舉之意，乃美國低估日本之軍力，竟得寸進尺，在西太平洋中節節蠢動。在十月初旬以後美竟集結了太平洋全力計哈爾賽的第三艦隊，史波羅盎斯的第五艦隊，全凱特的第七艦隊及其他麥克活塞部隊等，竟覬覦台灣菲律賓。日本冷不防的給予二次在台灣及菲東海面強大的殲滅戰，使美艦隊主力，幾全部潰滅。菲律賓羣島的雷伊泰島上美雖登陸已有十師團之多，但經日軍奮勇戰鬥，美防綫更被切斷，已有日暮窮途之槪。</p>
<p>茲將一九四四年歷次大東亞戰爭戰役擇要分列於下：</p>
<p>太平洋方面</p>
<p>一九四三年下半年，美國樹立其體制後，即積極準備反攻，自所羅門羣島瓜達康納爾開始。其後並向吉爾貝特羣島進襲；更致力於馬紹爾羣島鏖戰。太平洋決戰的局面，出此益臻明朗化。</p>
<p>庫魯兩島日軍殉職</p>
<p>一月　日晨起，美軍有力機動部隊，連續進攻庫埃茲林，魯奧特，及其他馬紹爾羣島全域，乃於二月一日在庫。魯兩島登陸。日海陸軍守備隊協力邀　，予敵莫大捐害，以寡兵力職，於二月六日，兩島陸海軍部隊及軍屬共六千五百人壯烈殉職，日島田海相對之發激昻談話。</p>
<p>波根維爾戰事</p>
<p>波根維爾島日軍，自三月上旬起對據守物羅基納附近防線之敵軍加以進襲，敵棄屍四千具，鹵獲大砲卅七尊，其他軍火不等。日軍陣亡約卅名。守備部隊堅守該島，自七月下旬以來，戰事漸趨激烈。八月十日日軍在加巴河地域邀擊登陸之敵。</p>
<p>馬利亞納之海空戰</p>
<p>六月中旬，敵美太平洋艦隊大部出現馬島附近，日航空部隊予以攻擊，至二十日止計擊沉敵戰艦及驅逐艦各一，巡洋艦二；炸毀空母四艘以上，戰艦二，巡洋艦四，擊落飛機三百餘架。爲呼應塞班島守備軍奮戰，連續奮擊，至三十日，戰果甚大，除炸沉敵戰艦一，巡洋艦驅逐艦各二，炸毀空母驅逐艦各二艘外，並擊落敵機二百十一架。日聯合艦隊之一部爲先發制人計，十九日在馬利亞納之另一面包圍敵機動部隊，至二十日晚擊沉空母五艘，（內有新銳班卡霍爾號）戰艦一艘，擊落敵機百架以上。</p>
<p>塞班島之戰役</p>
<p>六月上旬美機動部出現於馬利亞納諸島東方，以艦載機百九十架轟炸寒班島，十二日再襲該島，十四日美以空母十餘艘，戰艦八艘，輸送船七十餘艘，裝載士兵，實行登陸，　日守備隊，猛烈邀　　退，十五日午後，美軍一部佔據斯斯別　附近地區，逐潘擴大，日軍與之肉捕，破壤戰車十餘輛。十七日　，日軍因遭猛然烈砲擊，再度撤退。二十三日該島水源地全毀。二十五日日軍抱砲彈衝陣，敵美瞻戰。次日晚該島最高地塔保喬山被攻陷，日軍形勢驟然不利。二十八日日軍砲火，全毀。至七月七日晨日軍海陸空渾然一體，作最後慘烈之攻擊，終於全軍戰死。此役敵美軍自認爲太平洋作戰中最爲困難之戰。美軍損害達一萬五千餘名。惟以後該島仍有殘存日軍於困苦中作游擊戰而壯列戰死。其後日軍連續轟炸該島敵軍機塲。</p>
<p>大宮迭尼安島激戰</p>
<p>六月中，塞班島周圍如大宮島，迭尼安島，羅特島雙方海陸空戰鬥亦漸趨激烈。日軍以寡兵關係，最後甩被告敵軍登陸：七月中，大宮島之敵軍自登陸後，於明石街及昭和街之中心地區受重大損害；迭尼發島北區，自敵軍登陸後，日軍奮力阻止強大之敵軍南下，予以重創，至七月中，敵傷亡四千九百名。至七月底敵軍突入該島南部日軍之最後防綫，戰綫呈錯綜狀態。該島自七月二十一日至九月二十七日止，凡七十天，日軍孤軍奮鬥，忍受苦難，處境外之厄，無以復加，最後全體守軍，全部壯烈陣亡。</p>
<p>帛　羣島戰役</p>
<p>敵艦戰機群曾數度來壤加羅林羣島，七月中曾有七百五十架飛機到達，被擊落擊毀共百十架。九月初來襲帛琉，雅浦兩島，敵陸飛機百餘架。九月十五日敵麥克沃塞於帛琉羣島之帛里琉島登陸，日軍相繼向敵猛攻，雙方砲戰，激烈非常。十七日晨，敵機動部隊誶砲火掩護下，又開始登陸。帛島日守軍　兵奮戰，殲敵甚多，確守該島中央高地及北角，敵傷亡約五知被告，擊沉艦艇六十餘艘。十八日日軍作巧妙夜襲，又沉艦艇五十餘艘，戰車十五輛。以後敵增加傷亡計二萬餘，日軍寡兵負隅，不屈不撓，繼續猛烈肉搏，使美軍大生恐感。該島登陸爭奪戰誠能打破以前太平洋方面戰鬥之紀綠。</p>
<p>安格維爾登陸後，美捐失嚴重，日則縮短戰綫，以資却敵，美迭次被猛烈擊退，九月稍日軍更用肉膊攻擊，使敵捐傷驚退</p>
<p>新幾內亞戰事</p>
<p>四月下旬，日軍自馬當地區轉進，擊退優勢之敵；其後與敵登陸之約一師圍大戰，敵損失甚大。日對威瓦克與阿伊答伯間已克服障碍。七月十三日，日軍即開始攻擊新幾內亞方面拉普河畔敵陣地。薩爾密附近敵軍，八月中在瓦庫迭島附近佈陣；四朋至八月之日方戰果爲：敵棄屍二〇七九具，傷亡二六五〇名，墮落飛機四十八架，毀四十五架，其他軍需呂頗多。</p>
<p>必阿克島方面</p>
<p>五月下旬，美軍機動部隊，來襲新幾內亞西北方必阿克島，先以大砲猛轟，繼以一師團之衆登陸，日軍晝夜邀擊，予以擊潰。後敵兵增強至二師團，於獲得馬加撒，荷花蘭地亞等基地後，和於有利地位，然日軍頻頻巧妙轟炸，使敵損失不貲。惟終以寡兵禦敵，至七月二日必阿克方面日軍乃完成任務。</p>
<p>馬鹿加島戰事</p>
<p>馬島之摩羅泰島方面，敵軍約一師團於九月中旬登陸後，該島日陸上部隊，當即邀擊，以肉搏挺身戰法，抑制敵軍擴大，至十月底殺傷敵軍一千餘人。日空軍自十一月起更猛襲該島敵陣，獲得傳大戰果。</p>
<p>台灣東方海面戰役</p>
<p>敵美不知　晦，每思得寸進尺，以爲越島作戰，節節可得勝，低估日本實力，進迫到日本防衛內綫，簡直不可一世。到了十月初旬，竟覬覦台灣，以千餘架飛機百日轟炸。敵美艦隊係哈爾塞統率之太平洋第三艦隊，爲最精銳之機動部隊。十二日夜起發生激動啊隊。十二日夜起發生激烈海戰日軍部隊速戰皆捷。日大本營於十六日發表戰果如下：擊沈空母十艘，戰艦二艘，巡洋艦三艘，驅逐艦一艘；擊毀空母三艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦四艘，艦型不明者十一艘數，誠爲空前之戰績，直可媲美日俄戰爭。敵美經此慘敗後，尼米資爲收拾殘局，在十五日轟炸馬尼剌，以圖掩護安全撤退；但日軍繼續與之邀擊，在馬尼剌東海面擊沈空母一艘；擊落飛機三十架。</p>
<p>菲律賓登陸戰</p>
<p>敵美在台灣雖遭慘入，猶逞兇未已，不惜採用「逆戰法」，於十月十八日以殘餘敵空軍之艦隊輔以輸送船團，侵入菲律賓南方之雷伊泰島。</p>
<p>他們所派的軍力，有哈爾賽所率的第三艦隊殘餘，及史波盎斯的第五艦隊，金凱特的第七艦隊，和澳洲的艦集合而成，原擬一舉上陸，佔領菲島。那知却在雷伊泰灣遭到了日本海軍猛烈攻襲，敵登陸軍和艦隊却屢戰屢敗，至十月廿七日止所判明的戰果計擊沉敵艦一百卅餘艘，內包含空母卅九艘，戰艦十艘，巡洋艦十七艘。</p>
<p>雷伊泰島登陸情形：十八日美方以飛機空襲比薩牙地區及呂宋島等，下午開始艦砲射擊。十九日美一部於雷伊泰島南部之卡巴亮登陸，更於砲火掩護下，擬於塔克羅班附近，被日軍擊退。二十日敵軍復行登陸成功，惟大部份舟艇則被擊沉於海中。廿一日以後，敵軍雷伊泰之橋頭堡極爲狹小，其已登陸之三師團兵力負隅奮戰，傷亡慘重。其後增兵五師團至十師團，補給極感困難。日神風機隊以「搶撞戰術」攻擊該島　敵船團，戰果赫赫。該島要地爲瓦蓄，有兩道陣綫圍護，一日奧洋莫克至比那莫波安，一自卡里加拉至寗羅英，環繞高地一帶，雙方正展開激烈之白刃戰</p>
<p>十一月稍日飛機神風攻擊隊，在菲北呂宋島東海面猛襲敵部隊，敵艦五艘擊沈，由日潛艦呼應作戰，命中空母三艘，驅逐艦一艘。日八紱飛行隊於二十七日猛攻雷灣，擊沈，擊毀敵艦船十艘以上。</p>
<p>緬甸方面</p>
<p>緬甸方面日軍，先發制人，自進攻以來，戰無不勝更有印度國民軍協力喊出了進軍祖國，驅逐英美的口號，爲大東亞戰爭放一異彩。本年一月八日，自由印度政府自昭南遷至緬甸。其使命自能剋期完成。茲將印緬戰局，述要如下：</p>
<p>推進印度</p>
<p>據日本大本營發表：三月八日緬甸方面日有力部隊與印度國民軍協力，對琴丘陵附近之英印軍攻擊，另一部隊與印度國民軍同於三月十五日在霍馬林附近渡過更的宛河。三月二十三日，日軍在頓扎恩附近攻襲英印第十七師團，並支援印度國民軍，在三月中旬，進入印度國內；敵曾以空輸部隊侵入北緬，日軍即予追剿。在密芝那西北，則邀擊上富貢侵入之渝軍及英美聯軍。日軍八月中自密芝那方面撤退。自十一月上旬更在密芝那方發動反攻，予以重創。伊洛瓦底河水盡赤。</p>
<p>伊姆法爾戰事</p>
<p>印緬中部國境之日軍，於三月下旬，以主力向伊姆法爾平原進攻，至其北約四十公里之地點，已將敵重要補給綫如法爾哥希馬路。四月六日晨佔領伊姆法爾至達馬普爾公路要衝哥希馬。五月十一日，日空軍大編隊炸毀伊姆法爾飛機塲及市街。同時聯軍爲打通該地之輸血路計，在哥希馬周圍演大血戰，並在吉大港及西龍連續調　軍隊。於雨季後復思活動遭受重創，死四萬，負傷二十三萬餘名。</p>
<p>滇邊日守備隊殉國</p>
<p>滇事戰過極趨激烈，其原因有二：一爲反軸心軍艦於印工東境日亟，由此以牽制日軍；二，企圖打通來多公路，重開滇緬公路。日軍在拉孟騰越之守備部隊　予雲南方面渝軍以重創，於戰略上貢獻滋我。該兩守備隊盡其使命後，終於全體壯烈殉國，其偉勳九月二十由際軍省發表。</p>
<p>怒江方面戰事</p>
<p>渝軍自七月中渡過怒江以來，堅欲奪回要衝，捐失浩大，兵站補給極爲困難。渝軍至八月上旬止棄屍二一四八具</p>
<p>龍陵戰事</p>
<p>渝軍在雨季中以十師以上猛攻騰越，拉孟龍陵等，予以擊退。十月中渝軍調遺最精銳部隊第五軍第二百師，至龍陵附近反攻，經日軍擊退；又第二百師攻馬背　時，由日軍十六名邀擊並夜襲，戰果收穫頗多。</p>
<p>中國方面</p>
<p>英美在大東亞戰爭中聲嘶力竟，惴惴地從事於反攻，爲圖牽制日軍計，在中國大陸方面利用重慶的力量，與日軍抗戰，好使他們透過一口氣來。日軍在大東亞的戰略下，不得不節節進攻，以破英美的侵略勢力。</p>
<p>日軍移交廣州灣</p>
<p>去年二月十六日，華南方在日軍精銳部隊，以奇襲在雷州半島登陸，二十一日進駐廣州灣，締結日。越防衛協定，順利推行該區之軍政，治安於焉確定。本年三月一日華南日軍當憶宣告撤除廣州灣地域之軍政，將其劃入廣東省政府治下，正式作爲和平區。由廣東省畏陳耀祖與日軍司令官會南簽約，移歸國府管轄，日軍今臨終的專負作戰驚備使命。</p>
<p>日打通平漢路</p>
<p>日軍四月十八日渡過黃河進攻，於三星期內攻下鄭州，許昌，郾城，遂平，確山，平漢路得南北通達。日軍復指軍向西攻下　陽，襄城，　縣，登封，榮陽，值師等地，從南北兩路，進攻洛陽。渝美空軍逐漸活躍，經日軍擊落P49型機數架。</p>
<p>豫湘戰事</p>
<p>五月二十四日日軍總攻洛陽，次日佔領。湖南方面之日軍於十八日攻陷長沙醴陵，是乃第三次陷落。旋南向進攻衡陽，至七月二十六日，雙方激戰，歷二十九日，重慶當局二十四日發表日軍已進入衡陽市內；該市北部地區展開新激戰。日本大營發表，八月八日完全佔據該市。渝軍第十軍軍長方先覺等投向和平。</p>
<p>廣西戰事</p>
<p>日軍陷衡陽後，沿湘桂鐵路西南進展，十月九日入廣西省境，十三日佔道縣，次日佔全縣。二十四日抵達桂林東北八十公里之灌陽，由此遙向西南進攻。十一月十日攻陷桂林，復進入柳州。西南地區航空要塞，遂被告摧毀無餘。東南半壁，西南數省，乃與重慶隔離。十一月二十二日佔有懷遠；二十四日南略南寗。</p>
<p>日本沿黔桂鐵路十一月二十攻各金城江及灑池，二十八日攻下南丹，與突破黎明關，進入貴州省之部隊，共同繼續進攻中。十二月二日中央社電：駐渝美空窮第十四航空隊司令部認爲日軍有進攻省會貴陽之勢。</p>
<p>茲重慶當局因黔省已告危急，爲積極拯援計，特將七十六軍之二師及七十九軍之二師，配置於省境一帶，將七十六軍第一百九十六師，及九十軍之一部，配置於南宗附近，據有險要之山脈，在強烈艱辛抵坑中。</p>

<h3>Prime Minister's Address</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) Japanese Prime Minister Koiso delivered a speech at a reception held at the Imperial Hotel for envoys from various countries stationed in Japan on the 8th, forcefully stating the purpose of Japan's war and comparing and contrasting the enemy's (British and American) ambition to dominate the world with Japan's war aim of liberating East Asia. The gist is as follows:</p>
<p>Eliminating Aggressive Forces Completely At this crucial moment when the world's new destiny is being decided, I would like to explain in detail to the world the nature of this war and the purpose of our operations. This operation seeks to liberate the homelands of the East Asian peoples from the oppression of the British and Americans, to forcefully eliminate the British and American aggressors, and to defend East Asia. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese military has fought bravely, expelling the enemy's aggressive forces from East Asia, laying the foundation for the restoration and prosperity of East Asia. Among your home countries, there are also many patriots who are cooperating with Japan, responding to the Japanese military's operations, and rising up one after another, jointly dedicating themselves to the holy war to restore East Asia. Now that British and American forces in China have been completely swept away, Burma and the Philippines have achieved their long-held aspirations and achieved independence, and the Republic of China, which has reclaimed concessions and abolished extraterritoriality, has now become a completely autonomous and independent great power, and is cooperating with Japan to move towards establishing lasting peace in East Asia. The construction of a new East Asia based on morality is progressing vigorously day by day. Thus, the collective ideal of the construction of East Asia by various countries and nations crystallized into the Greater East Asia Declaration, that is, our East Asian countries will liberate East Asia from British and American aggression and exploitation in order to seek its restoration.</p>
<p>Economic Reciprocity and Open Resources At the same time, it seeks to realize cooperation, friendship, and a peaceful order with all countries in the world on the principle of mutual equality in the political sphere, without coercion or aggression. In the economic sphere, it seeks to ensure morality, freedom, and the realization of the ideal of opening up a common market for resources based on the principle of reciprocity. Conversely, the British and Americans are stubbornly attempting to permanently place the entire world under their absolute authority, to monopolize world resources, and to satisfy their plundering desires. They are manipulating their strategic offensives, disrupting the alliance of the Axis powers, and oppressing neutral countries, attempting to lure them into their sphere of influence. They are even deludedly believing that they will win, and are talking grandly about post-war management, feigning sincerity towards international peace. However, their so-called world peace is nothing more than the domination of the world by Britain and the United States, placing Asia under their control. They are manipulating their cruel means in everything, including military, economic, political, and cultural matters, in order to maintain and strengthen their exploitative and aggressive mechanisms, with the intention of making the world submit to their own power. There is no doubt that their unbridled ambition has been revealed by the announcement of the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>Fighting Together with European Allies In response to this ambition to dominate the world, the countries of East Asia are becoming increasingly indignant, vowing to defend East Asia to the death, and are cooperating with European allies to destroy the fierce enemy in order to establish lasting peace in the world. We are now enthusiastically participating in the decisive battle. Our unity is becoming ever closer, and our determination is becoming ever more firm. The war situation is now urgent. The decisive battle for the fate of Greater East Asia and Europe is becoming increasingly severe. Although the enemy has abundant material resources, in order to conceal their ambiguous war aims and maintain their easily disrupted unity, they are eager for a short-term ceasefire. Therefore, the key to turning the tide of the war lies in this intense stage of decisive battle. At present, we must seize the opportunity with an unyielding spirit and a strong sense of courage, fight resolutely, and without a doubt, final victory will belong to us because we are on the side of justice.</p>
<h3>Mr. Iguchi, Director of the Information Bureau, Discusses the Current Stage of the War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) Mr. Iguchi, Director of the Third Department of the Information Bureau, gave a speech on the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, explaining the current stage of the war, Japan's war aims, and the enemy's aggressive policies, and denouncing the enemy, Britain and the United States, as those responsible for the war. The original text is as follows: This unprecedented war in history is still continuing, causing human civilization to stagnate or even regress. Not only are countless precious cultural achievements reduced to ashes by war, but also many promising young people who will bear the fate of the world in the future are losing their lives. However, if we consider the root cause of this human tragedy, we should attribute it to the aggressive policies of Britain and the United States, which hinder peace, seek to dominate the world politically and economically, and only pursue their own national interests. This becomes even clearer when we look at the course of the outbreak of the war. Japan and the countries of Greater East Asia are united, single-mindedly pursuing their common war aims, and will continue to wage a brave struggle to destroy their war potential until they lose their will to fight. During the First World War, Britain and the United States repeatedly called for a war to end all wars, but the result of the First World War became the cause of even greater wars. The greatest responsibility for this lies with the victorious powers of the time, Britain and the United States, who pursued a policy of dominating the world, monopolizing prosperity, following the strong, and being exclusivist and selfish. Especially in East Asia, Britain and the United States not only strengthened their exploitation of the colonies, but also incited the Chongqing regime to wage war against Japan, in order to divide China and pit East Asia against each other. The leaders of the great war in Britain and the United States, by employing this kind of policy, caused the world to fall into the scourge of war again, and at the same time, caused the sons and daughters of their countries to sacrifice themselves in wars that had nothing to do with their own lives, and to continue to sacrifice themselves. On the contrary, Japan's war aims have been specifically stated in the Greater East Asia Declaration last year, and the explanation given by Foreign Minister Shigemitsu recently is also very clear. They originate from the self-defense and liberation of the East Asian peoples, and aim to lay a new foundation for world peace through the sovereignty and equality of all countries, economic reciprocity, and cultural exchange. Therefore, the organization of British and American despotism and the ideology of exercising military force are fundamentally different from those of Japan. At the current stage of the war, the fundamental opposition between the war aims of the two sides has become extremely clear, and everyone in the world can recognize those responsible for this war. At this time, the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly favorable to Japan. In the important areas supporting the war, the enemy is gradually being suppressed. The morale of the Japanese front and rear is becoming increasingly high, and they are increasingly able to grasp the belief in a just war and march straight towards victory.</p>
<h3>A Righteous Army Will Surely Prevail in the End</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) Mr. Mishina, Director of the Press Department of the China Expeditionary Army, gave a recorded broadcast from the Tokyo Central Broadcasting Station on the evening of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, entitled "The China Expeditionary Army Conducting the Greater East Asia War on the Chinese Mainland." The gist is as follows:</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Churchill once made the preposterous statement that justice does not necessarily prevail in any world, meaning that no matter how clear the cause, war does not necessarily lead to victory, and there may even be times when one is defeated. Can the great cause of war be simply a matter of wrestling between philosophical forces? Indeed, if we look at history, both East and West, ancient and modern, the righteous do not necessarily win, and there are times when they fail. However, in such situations, the righteous may appear to have failed, but they have not actually been crushed. In other words, in such situations, defeat is only a superficial phenomenon, and is not affected in essence. If we look at the changes in world history, justice is the ultimate victor, and this has become the driving force for the development of human society. Therefore, that which absolutely determines victory in war is the cause of righteousness. All other factors can be said to be relative. Therefore, without a great cause, it is extremely difficult to win a war. Even if victory is achieved, it is only a temporary phenomenon. The iron law of history has proclaimed to us that the unrighteous will surely fail, without a doubt. Consider Napoleon, who once dominated all of Europe and acted as he pleased. But how long did it last before he died a prisoner on St. Helena? This Greater East Asia War is a war of great cause, unprecedented in history. Its purpose is to overthrow the Anglo-Saxon imperialism that has oppressed East Asia for centuries, and to create a purely East Asian Pan-Asian society in the Greater East Asia region in order to contribute to the establishment of world peace. This great ideal is a great cause that is unchanging throughout ancient and modern times, and throughout the world. Now that the Greater East Asia War has reached its third anniversary, although there have been many superficial changes, the belief in certain victory among every Japanese citizen is becoming stronger. This is because the entire nation has grasped the historical iron law that "justice never fails" and has made it a national faith.</p>
<p>If China and Japan cannot cooperate forever, then the name of the Greater East Asia War will always be an empty word. The cooperation between China and Japan that I am talking about now is based on the great cause of the Greater East Asia War. This is not something that can be achieved through hegemony or cunning tactics, but can only be ensured by walking the path of benevolence, righteousness, and the right way. On this third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I hereby express that the soldiers of the China Expeditionary Army will uphold the great way that the benevolent are invincible and righteousness will never perish, strengthen their belief in certain victory, and advance shoulder to shoulder with our comrades fighting in the Pacific and Southeast Asia towards the path of victory.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Greater East Asia War after Three Years: Broadcast Address by Director of Information Kishi</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) (Continued from yesterday) What we should know is the Americans are uncertain about their own destiny. An article published in the magazine *American Business* in June pointed out that "Japan has won in the political war." At the start of the Greater East Asia War, they boasted that "victory will be achieved within three months," but three years later, they have fallen into a crisis. They boast about abundant resources, but the rubber parts of the B-29 aircraft shot down in Northern Kyushu were made of crude rubber. To put it plainly, if we suffer, they will suffer too. Today is the opportune moment to thoroughly crush the arrogant enemy, Britain and the United States, and strive for victory. Because the closer the enemy gets to the Japanese mainland, the longer their supply lines become, and the more advantageous the terrain becomes for Japan. Japan's war preparations are now foolproof. However, those who are careless can make great mistakes. We cannot underestimate the enemy's resources, but war intention is the key to victory or defeat. The spirit of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force is unmatched by the material power of Britain and the United States. (End)</p>
<h3>Japan Will Surely Retaliate Against American Aircraft Bombing: Prime Minister Koiso Explains Determination Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) On the morning of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War on the 8th, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, in a broadcast speech, expressed the determination of 100 million people regarding the bombing of Tokyo by American aircraft as follows: We, the Japanese people, who have a firm resolution to fight to the end and a belief in certain victory, are not afraid of this bombing by the enemy Americans. The more the enemy bombs, the more we will strengthen our unwavering determination with the increase in their bombs. If the enemy Americans dare to harm the central region we revere in the future, the Japanese people vow to inflict harsh retaliatory measures on the American people.</p>

<h3>Further Understanding of the Greater East Asia War: Speeches at the "Citizens' Celebration Rally" and "Shanghai Radio Broadcast" in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Today marks the third anniversary of our commemoration of the Greater East Asia War. However, this commemoration is particularly significant as it falls during a decisive moment in the war. Over the past three years, we have held the Allied Japanese military and civilians in the Greater East Asia War in utmost respect for their achievements. China is an important member of the Greater East Asia War. We have spoken extensively about our responsibilities in the war and how to cooperate to ultimately achieve victory. Today, I want to discuss the further understanding that people within the peace zone and those under the rule of Chongqing should have.</p>
<p>In the Pacific, the enemy Americans have repeatedly suffered heavy blows. Recently, the enemy American naval and air forces invading the Philippines, under the heroic counterattack of the Allied forces, have reached the end of their strength. The enemy British on the borders of India and Burma have consistently been restrained by the Allied forces. As for mainland China, the Allied forces are making steady progress and have now broken into Guizhou Province, further exacerbating Chongqing's predicament. These glorious victories and favorable situations are entirely the price paid by the Allied military and civilians, who have shouldered the heavy burden of the Greater East Asia War, through their united and arduous struggle. Although our contributions to the Greater East Asia War in terms of manpower and resources over the past three years have not been insignificant, we are truly ashamed when compared to the Allied military and civilians! We have full confidence in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. However, we should understand that our enemies, Britain and America, are not so fragile and can still make a final struggle; at the same time, they are further coercing and driving Chongqing to be our enemy and sacrifice itself for them. This increases our difficulties and makes our responsibilities heavier. Most compatriots within the peace zone can recognize this future and devote themselves to the cause of national liberation, but there are also some compatriots who neglect the awareness of how to be a dutiful citizen, and there is a need to awaken them in this regard.</p>
<p>This war is a war for the liberation of the East Asian nations, a war that will determine whether the Chinese nation will be masters or slaves. All Chinese people cannot stand outside the war; they must live in the war. Of course, the government should urgently seek ways to strive in this regard. However, each of our citizens should further recognize that national liberation requires the entire nation to have an independent sense of self-respect and an independent demand. Only then can there be the liberation of the entire nation. Historical development is a continuous struggle. Struggle cannot be separated from reality or take a break, waiting until it suits one's own interests to work hard again. Know that the evolution of history is not linear but curved. If we adopt an attitude of "prudent self-preservation" or a mentality of "fishing in troubled waters" at any time, then, from an individual perspective, we may escape temporary difficulties or ascend to heaven in one step, but directly or indirectly, we weaken or lose the vitality of the nation. If we do not first seek national independence and freedom, then individual temporary comfort and wealth are not only castles in the sand, but conversely, due to our disloyalty and lack of effort to the nation, we increase the responsibilities and difficulties of the next generation. When the war reaches a difficult and decisive moment, when the entire nation rises up together, I hope that compatriots from all walks of life in the peace zone will take the interests of the nation as their own and devote themselves to the great cause of national liberation, that is, to cooperate in the successful completion and victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>All Chinese people should stand together and strive. This is the hope for the compatriots in the peace zone; however, for the compatriots under the rule of Chongqing, I now have even greater expectations. I sympathize with your distress of not being able to freely develop your ambitions. We believe that many of you must have understood the true meaning of comprehensive peace and are willing to run to our side. Now you are only restricted by the environment and cannot express it. However, I believe that this distress will eventually be relieved for you, as long as you can be firm, hold more of your desire for comprehensive peace, find ways to influence others, and jointly urge the Chongqing authorities to become aware, complete peace, and establish a truly independent country.</p>
<p>However, although there must be many people who understand the true meaning of comprehensive peace, I am afraid that there are still many people who are currently confused by Chongqing's reckless dragging on the war. For these people, I sincerely ask you to wake up soon. Japan has long signed equal treaties with China and has already practically abandoned the various privileges left in China by Britain and America, and has returned the concessions. Within the peace zone, except for the combat troops, we have gained complete autonomy. Conversely, Chongqing is now clearly controlled by Britain and America, especially the United States. Dragging on the war only serves as a tool for Britain and America, dragging on the war only expands the power of the Communist Party, and the common people suffer more and more, and the more the country drags on the more its vitality is lost. At the same time, the facts are very clearly in front of our eyes. The Chongqing army is retreating steadily, and the Japanese army has now reached the border of Guizhou Province. The "War of Resistance" that you have hoped for from Chongqing for more than eight years for national independence and liberation can now prove to be a complete failure, dragging you into a colonial position that is even worse than before. The Japanese side has stated that it does not consider the people of Chongqing as enemies. In Hunan, Guangxi, and now Guizhou, the sincerity of the Japanese side is clearer to you than to me in Shanghai, right? Whether Chongqing can achieve victory, in this defeat, you understand it better than me in Shanghai, right? With these many facts placed before you, you should face reality and not be blinded by the one-sided propaganda of Britain and America. You should wake up soon, join hands with those who have already awakened, and urge the Chongqing authorities to make a decision quickly, stop dragging on the war, and help achieve comprehensive peace. Chongqing relies on you, the common people, to be its pillar for it to exist. As long as you can all wake up, then, if the pillar is lost, the elements dragging on the war will inevitably be powerless. People in the peace zone and under the rule of Chongqing, please unite together!</p>

<h3>Encouraging All East Asian Nations to Continue Advancing the Total War: Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government Delivered a Broadcast Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - For the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government, at 9:20 PM on the 8th, gave a broadcast speech to the national citizens and all East Asian comrades via the Central Radio Station, encouraging them to strive forward. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War has now been exactly three years. In the past three years, the nations and peoples of East Asia have risen up together, gathered their total strength, and formed a unified front and rear. Under the common goal of defending and building East Asia, they have actively advanced. This is the greatest struggle launched by the Asian nations for common survival and development since Asia has had history.</p>
<p>For over a century, countless wars have occurred in Asian countries. Those wars were either the imperialists attacking us separately or jointly, and the Asian nations only rose up to resist in a piecemeal fashion, eventually being bullied and trampled upon, or they were provoked and alienated by the imperialists, leading to the tragedy of mutual slaughter. This allowed the imperialists to take advantage of the situation, seize our land, plunder our resources, and enslave our compatriots. Only this time, all Asian nations and peoples, with a common goal and for a common action, have risen up together to fight to eliminate aggression, for common defense, and for common survival.</p>
<p>From a passive perspective, the Greater East Asia War is to expel the common enemy of East Asia for over a century, the Anglo-American aggressors, to strive for the liberation of all East Asian nations. From a positive perspective, it is also to combine the inherent moral righteousness of the East Asian nations to build a new world where East Asia can permanently coexist and prosper. Therefore, this large-scale unprecedented decisive battle is of great significance.</p>
<p>Building an Independent and Autonomous Nation - Since the Opium War, China has gradually become a semi-colony of Anglo-American aggressors. Coastal ports were almost completely occupied by them, becoming bridgeheads for Anglo-American economic aggression. Many other cities were also opened up as concessions, building bases for their political and cultural aggression. Material resources were also mostly enslaved and exploited. Compatriots throughout the country have endured humiliation and carried grievances, living a subhuman life of slavery under the shackles of unequal treaties. It was not until Sun Yat-sen advocated the National Revolution that the continuous struggle for national independence against aggression began. The purpose of the National Revolution was to seek freedom and equality for China, and at the same time to seek independence and liberation for Asian countries. To achieve this goal, it was necessary to awaken the masses and unite with the nations in the world that treat us equally, and to struggle together. Only in this way can we overthrow the remaining feudal forces internally and overthrow the aggressive forces of the imperialists externally. Only in this way can we develop the national strength and link up with friendly countries with shared interests and common destiny to win back the position of master and establish an independent and autonomous modern nation, and establish a group of nations that support each other. The blood and sweat sacrificed by compatriots throughout the country for this purpose cannot be said to be few, and the struggles engaged in for this purpose cannot be said to be not fierce. In the past fifty or sixty years, the reason why the nation has been able to avoid the misfortune of being partitioned and jointly administered, and the reason why it has been able to strive for increased international status amid all kinds of difficulties, is all due to the continuous struggles, continuous sacrifices, and continuous bloodshed of compatriots throughout the country. However, the strength of a united country is not strong enough, and when internal unity is not yet consolidated, the imperialists will instigate and manipulate, leading to differences of opinion and internal strife. Furthermore, because the diplomatic policy is indecisive and it is impossible to establish alliances with other countries, causing fragmentation and confusion, and with foreign troubles pressing, the cunning Anglo-American imperialists are able to exert various conspiracies of coercion, temptation, and division. The National Revolution has risen and fallen, suffering setbacks, and the unfortunate Sino-Japanese Incident was also triggered by these internal and external contradictions. This is the old story that we cannot help but recall today as the Greater East Asia War has developed to this point.</p>
<p>East Asia is One Family, Sharing Life and Death - The means by which imperialists practice aggression are: first, the oppression of force, making people afraid to resist; and second, insidious manipulation, making people unable to resist. This is true for India, for Burma, for various parts of Southeast Asia, for China, and for the entire East Asia. Therefore, the strategy of anti-aggression lies not only in defending against the aggressor's force, but especially in preventing the aggressor's insidious and cunning tactics. Only in this way can we amass all the necessary and possible forces to engage in a struggle that is bound to win and not lose. As far as China is concerned, this principle must be achieved by ensuring that the Party cannot be divided and the country must be unified, and then China's freedom and equality can be ensured. As far as East Asia is concerned, it must also be ensured that East Asia is one family, sharing life and death, and then the victory of the decisive battle can be expected, and the construction of common prosperity can be achieved.</p>
<p>For six years, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, we have been committed to the movement of establishing a nation with peace and harmony. Its basic concept lies in a unified party, a unified country, seeking unified peace, that is, in first restoring Sino-Japanese relations, and then closely cooperating to jointly respond to world changes, contributing to world peace by stabilizing East Asia. Although time has passed and unification has not been achieved, and peace has not been established, our wishes have remained the same. Our efforts have not been relaxed in the slightest. When the Greater East Asia War came, thanks to the Allied Japan rising up, on the one hand, taking on the role of the vanguard in defending East Asia, and on the other hand, igniting the unity of the East Asian nations, the Sino-Japanese Incident was transformed into a war to defend East Asia, and the original face of the National Revolution could be completed, and the basic concept of the peace movement became even clearer. Our wishes therefore had the opportunity to be realized, and our efforts were therefore able to get started. Therefore, shortly after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government resolutely declared war. We deeply knew that seeking China's freedom and equality was a once-in-a-millennium key, and we had to strive to be strong and not lag behind others. We also knew that the stability of East Asia, the survival of each East Asian nation, and their common survival were all tied to this battle. A good opportunity could not be missed, so there was no hesitation, and no one hesitated. In these three years, the Allied Japan, with all its elite troops and strength, took on the role of the vanguard of the struggle, engaging the enemy on the battlefield, and has already achieved brilliant results. Other friendly nations in East Asia have also risen up to fight without fail, offering all their manpower and material resources, either advancing wave upon wave, engaging the brutal enemy in close combat, or cooperating with the Allies, fulfilling the heavy responsibilities of the rear. Therefore, as the Greater East Asia War progresses to the current stage of its climax, the fighting spirit of all East Asian nations is becoming more and more vigorous, and the axis of defending East Asia is also expanding and strengthening day by day.</p>
<p>Final Victory Will Surely Belong to Us - Since the Greater East Asia War is a war for the liberation of all East Asian nations, we can only make the determination of a revolution, coordinate with close actions, and use all our total strength, producing non-stop, to make a vow-to-die decisive battle. Only with the determination of a revolution can we strengthen the belief of certain victory, and only with close actions can we eliminate all difficulties. All of East Asia has a billion-strong fighting force, with unparalleled huge material resources, solid maritime fortresses, and vast continental bases. Applying them to the determination and action of revolution, then the final victory will surely belong to us, without a doubt. The war situation may still extend with ups and downs, but the more the war situation extends, the more intense our struggle will be, and therefore our victory will be closer, more certain, and more assured.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, what is the future of China? I once said, "No matter what country, if it wants to survive and wants to revive, the most reliable way is to rely on itself. There are many ways to work hard by oneself, and the most important point is that as a participating country, it has the responsibilities of a participating country, and at the same time, it should fulfill the obligations of a participating country. Whether we can seek freedom and equality from the Greater East Asia War and ensure freedom and equality depends first on how much responsibility we bear for the Greater East Asia War and how many obligations we fulfill."</p>
<p>Promoting Peace and Rescuing Chongqing - In terms of the current situation, consolidating the rear, supplying the front, and crushing the enemy's remaining forces, so that they abandon their ambition to re-invade East Asia, is the first important task. Promoting peaceful unification and rescuing Chongqing, so that it gets rid of the shackles of Britain and America, is another important task. How can we consolidate the rear? Chairman Wang instructed: (1) To rectify thought, (2) To establish security, (3) To stabilize people's livelihood. How can we supply the front? (1) To increase production, (2) To conserve consumption. We have made continuous efforts in this regard in the past, and we should make even greater efforts in the future. As for peaceful unification and rescuing Chongqing, what are the obstacles to peace, what are the difficulties in unification, and what is the distress of Chongqing? These are all things that we should deeply consider and jointly seek to break through.</p>
<p>On the day when the fourth year of the Greater East Asia War begins, as we look forward to the brightness of the future, we cannot help but think of the constant teachings that Chairman Wang gave us during his lifetime. We firmly believe that Chairman Wang's prescient instructions and the appeal of his great personality will surely make all our compatriots never forget. We vow to inherit his legacy, to implement the original intention of the peace movement, and to complete the Greater East Asia War and the mission of revitalizing China and protecting Asia. Compatriots throughout China, comrades throughout Asia, the light is before us, let us move forward!</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Departs from Nanjing for Japan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to China Gu, in order to consult with his home government on important matters, departed from Nanjing for Japan by plane on the morning of the 8th, accompanied by military attaches Imai and Maeda, and Secretary Qingshui.</p>
<h3>Enhebatu Dies, National Government Issues Order of Commendation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - After Enhebatu, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee of the National Government, passed away at his residence in Nanjing on the 6th due to illness, the National Government issued an order of commendation on the 8th, and granted 100,000 yuan for funeral expenses.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Captures Longzhou, Opens Up Border Between Guangxi and Vietnam, Main Artery Across the Continent to be Completed Soon</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - After capturing Nanning on November 24, the Japanese army continued to advance and has now approached the border of Vietnam. On the other hand, the Japanese army in Vietnam also began to attack within Guangxi Province at the end of November. Its right-wing troops captured Mingjiang on the 30th, and its left-wing troops captured Longzhou (a key fortress between Nanning and the Vietnamese border) on December 3rd. As a result, the Chongqing army's border defense posture was completely disrupted. When the Japanese army attacked the Guilin-Liuzhou area, the Chongqing military authorities stated that they would dispatch the border garrison to the Guilin-Liuzhou battlefield to fight, so the area was left empty. As a result, the Japanese army took advantage of the emptiness and entered after breaking through the border line, further penetrating into Guangxi Province to meet up with the Japanese army moving south. The Chongqing camp, regarding this offensive, while the Battle of Hengyang was in full swing, once said that "the Japanese army's operational intention is to connect Beijing to Guangzhou via Hankou, achieving its 2,000-kilometer-long Great Wall line that bisects the continent," but this time, due to the imminent meeting of the Japanese Southern Army and the Japanese Army in Vietnam, the Japanese strategic artery, which runs from Busan, Fengtian, Beijing, Hankou, Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin, Nanning, and then to Hanoi, through Bangkok to Syonan, a total length of 5,000 kilometers, is about to be completed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the progress of the Japanese Southern Army and the Japanese Army in Vietnam in the operation to bisect the Chinese mainland, it is expected that the two armies will be able to meet in the near future, and the continental bisecting railway will also gradually reach the stage of realization. For the opening of the continental bisecting railway, the Japanese Diet explained it last year in Railway Minister Hatta's plan, and the realization problem still requires considerable time. However, after investigation, it is known that it can also be realized in a very short period. Once the Japanese army opens up the mainland, construction can begin. The main line of the continental bisecting railway starts from Tokyo, passes through Busan, Fengtian, Beijing, and then reaches Hankou via the Beijing-Hankou Line, connects to the Guangdong-Hankou Line, passes through Zhuzhou, Hengyang, to Liuzhou, Nanning, and enters Vietnam from Zhennanguan to Hanoi, and then passes through Tanap and Bangkok, to reach the terminal Syonan. The second line is from Tokyo to Nagasaki, reaching Shanghai by sea, passing through Jinhua, Nanchang, Zhuzhou, and connecting with the first line. The distance between Tokyo and Syonan on the first line is 10,870 kilometers, requiring 9 days and 13 hours. The distance between Shanghai and Syonan on the second line is 5,200 kilometers, requiring 4 days and 23 hours, and 6 days and 23 hours from Tokyo. The parts that have not yet been completed are 640 kilometers between Liuzhou and Zhennanguan in China, and 200 kilometers between Tanap and Tatakek in Vietnam, totaling only 840 kilometers. From a topographical point of view, there are no problems in construction on the Chinese side. Although the Annam Mountains obstruct the Vietnamese border, there are no difficulties. If tunnel construction begins, it can be completed at the latest within a year. After this road is completed, the enemy's air guerrilla warfare will lose its power, and the transportation between Japan and the southern regions will be smooth, and transportation can be strengthened, so it is indeed a great undertaking to complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Aizawa Returns Home, Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Former Japanese Special Envoy to Vietnam Aizawa, having completed his three-year term, returned home on the 5th. On the 7th, he met with reporters at the Greater East Asia Ministry and issued the following statement: French Vietnam is a region with differences in rulers and the ruled, and in race. The 23 million residents there are placed under the rule of white people, so Japan adopts an extremely solemn attitude in this state. The Vietnamese Governor-General's Office also cooperates with Japan in a difficult and complex environment. In the past, during economic warfare negotiations, there were some frictions, but after General Governor Decoux made a thorough judgment on the overall situation, he was able to accept Japan's opinions. In addition, I further expect that it will continue to proceed smoothly in the future according to the previous policy. Furthermore, the U.S. military has begun to attack the Philippines and has publicly stated that it will establish air bases on the Chinese mainland, but the facts show us that the victory of the Battle of Leyte Island will undoubtedly belong to Japan. At the same time, the large-scale operations of the Japanese army on the Chinese mainland have resulted in the longitudinal railway from Peiping to Guangzhou falling into the hands of the Japanese army, so the U.S. military's wild hopes have failed.</p>
<h3>Soviet Tank Brigade 30 Miles from Hongdu, Establishes Bridgehead on the Danube</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports that a German military spokesman pointed out that the Soviet tank brigade that broke through the German-Hungarian defense line east of Hatvan and penetrated deeply has now reached 30 kilometers north of Hongdu. The army initially advanced northwest towards the Danube bend north of Hongdu, but when it reached 30 kilometers from the river bend, it suddenly turned south. Currently, the German army is fiercely fighting the Soviet tank force. South of Hongdu, the German defense line extends eastward from the northern end of Lake Platten to the Danube. On the 5th, the Soviet army established six bridgeheads on this front line. On the 6th, the German army counterattacked and destroyed four of them, and the remaining two were merged into one bridgehead, with the widest point being two kilometers.</p>
<h3>Japan's Asian Cooperation Council Holds Second Day of Meetings</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The second day of the Asian Cooperation Movement Coordination Committee, hosted by the Asian Cooperation Headquarters of Japan, was held at the Greater East Asia Hall here on the morning of the 7th at 9:00 a.m., and Mr. Takagi, Director-General of the Asian Cooperation Headquarters of Japan, was elected as chairman. In the morning, the current situation of the national movements in China, Japan, and Manchuria was explained separately, and in the afternoon, the essential points of the Asian cooperation movement and its specific movement policies were discussed, as well as the promotion policies for the total strength posture of Asian cooperation in various countries and regions, and the promotion of the youth group movement in various countries, and various discussions were held. Finally, it was decided to make November 6, the anniversary of the announcement of the Greater East Asia Declaration, as Greater East Asia Memorial Day. At 4:30 p.m., the association and the Greater Japan Political Association's Asian Cooperation Headquarters hosted a dinner party at the Greater East Asia Hall to commemorate the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. The participants included the Ambassador of Manchuria, Counselor Wang of the Republic of China, Ambassador Vargas of the Philippines, Ambassador Zan Mon of Burma, Ambassador Ukit of Thailand, and related personnel. Prime Minister Matsui and related personnel attended on the host side. They had dinner together and held various discussions, and the meeting ended at 7:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>The Loqius Conference will be brought forward. Kerr returns home to report.</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) - A German news agency reports, citing news from New York: Informed sources in New York believe that the Loqius Conference may be brought forward.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) - A German news agency reports, citing news from London: British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kerr left Moscow on the 7th to return home to report on his duties.</p>
<h3>There is a saying that the Soviet Union and France have made an alliance.</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - A German news agency reports, citing Paris Broadcasting: After Teger returned to France from the Soviet Union, it is feared that a Soviet military mission will arrive in France soon as a prelude to the signing of an alliance between the Soviet Union and France.</p>
<h3>Teger inspects the Eastern Prussian front line.</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - A German news agency reports, citing news from Paris: General Teger has left Moscow for the Eastern Prussian front line and will inspect the "Normandy" formation there.</p>
<h3>The crisis of the Bonomi government has been eliminated.</h3>
<p>Milan, 8th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports, citing news from Rome: Bonomi told the press last night that we have reached the end of the road, and I will now take over as the head of the government. This statement proves that the crisis of the government has been temporarily eliminated. Fammostai will serve as Foreign Minister, and Communist Togliatti and Christian Democratic leader Gasparri will be appointed as Deputy Prime Ministers.</p>
<h3>Record of Su Kunyu's Inspection of Rice Producing Areas (3)</h3>
<p>Two, Collection of Land Tax in Kind</p>
<p>Since ancient times until the Ming Dynasty, China's land tax was collected in kind. For example, during the Han Dynasty, one-fifteenth of farmers' income was taken as tax. During the Tang Dynasty, the Zuyongdiao system was implemented, which collected rice (Zu), silk, damask, paintings (Diao), and corvée labor, or the commutation of Han silk (Yong). It was not until the third year of Ming Yingzong (507 years ago) that an order was given to commute the tax to silver, and later it was changed to gold, silver, legal tender, and other currencies for the payment of land tax.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, due to the extremely drastic changes in commodity prices this year, changed the land tax to collection in kind for two reasons: First, to maintain the financial expenditure of the provincial government. Second, to maintain the rice supply for the provincial military and police. The planned amount of land tax to be collected this year is 660,000 shi (unit of dry volume, approx. 100 liters), which is based on the conversion of last year's cash payment of land tax into in-kind collection. This planned amount accounts for 40% of the total land tax calculated based on the total cultivated area of Jiangsu Province. It is planned that one-third of the collected rice will be used for the provincial military and police, to be distributed by the provincial government. The other two-thirds will in principle be sold to the Rice Control Association, hoping to stabilize the livelihood of the people in the four major cities in the province through rice rationing.</p>
<p>The amount of land tax collected averages one dou (unit of dry volume, approx. 10 liters) per mu (unit of area, approx. 0.16 acres) in Changshu. For farmers paying on behalf of landowners, farmers pay rice for land tax at the sub-collection office and receive a temporary receipt. The amount corresponding to the land rent is deducted from the amount used to pay the land tax, and then the temporary receipt and the land rent amount are handed over together to exchange for an official receipt.</p>
<p>In Changshu, a unified measure of land tax, land rent, and rice purchase is implemented. The method has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for filing. The main points and steps are: First, the average purchase quantity for farmers is four dou per mu. Second, farmers pay one dou per mu for land tax. Third, the receipt and rent amount (deducting the price of land tax rice) are handed over to the landowner. The collected land tax is sold to the Rice Control Association, with half going to the county government for disposal and the other half remitted to the province.</p>
<p>The biggest key to the in-kind collection of land tax is whether there are malpractices such as excessive collection, delayed payment, embezzlement, and corruption between the farmers' delivery to the provincial government. The journalist group asked the provincial government about this issue. According to the representative of the provincial government, "The authorities will do their best to prevent it, and use a joint form 'one original and three copies' as proof, with the county governments directly responsible. At the same time, strict supervision will be exercised to prevent the generation of malpractices."</p>
<p>Based on the inspection, the following three points are summarized to inform the authorities:</p>
<p>First, it is said that the sub-collection office of land tax uses large scales (24-liang scale) during in-kind collection, so that farmers actually need to pay one dou and five sheng (unit of dry volume, approx. 1 liter) to pay one dou of land tax, resulting in a large loss for farmers.</p>
<p>Second, the fines stipulated by the Jiangsu authorities, such as "late payment fees," mean that farmers who pay land tax after the specified time are required to pay fines, with the amount reaching one-tenth of the land tax. Farmers are quite distressed about this. It is hoped that the "late payment fee" method will be abolished and replaced with an incentive method to encourage farmers to complete grain payment as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Third, in the cotton-producing areas of Changshu, the land tax paid is also calculated at one dou of rice, or the black market price of one dou of rice is paid to the land tax sub-collection office, which then purchases rice on their behalf to pay the grain tax. (The reporter asked County Chief Wang of Changshu about this issue, and he denied it, but according to the deputy director of the land tax sub-collection office in Meili Town, it has indeed been implemented.) The cotton harvested by farmers is sold at the official price, but to pay the land tax, they need to purchase rice at the black market price or pay according to this price, which is somewhat unfair.</p>
<p>Since the relevant authorities claim that rice and grain are no longer commodities and are listed as important resources in the rear during the war, then farmers are soldiers engaged in production. Farmers hand over purchased rice for military and civilian needs on the one hand, and pay land tax to maintain the rationed rice for military, police, and officials on the other hand. In principle, farmers should be treated with respect and love. In reality, the heavy burden of miscellaneous taxes and levies borne by farmers is shocking. It is hoped that the authorities will think more about farmers in the future and not just take land tax from farmers while being indifferent to the living conditions of farmers. At the same time, the lower-level institutions of the current local politics, as well as the Baojia administrative officials who come into contact with farmers, should be eliminated and thoroughly reformed, so as not to betray the farmers' earnest expectations.</p>
<p>Three, Land Rent Issues</p>
<p>According to the authorities' report, landlords in the Suzhou area own 70% of the total land, while self-cultivating farmers only account for 30%. From this, it can be seen that land rent is no less important than buying rice in terms of people's livelihood.</p>
<p>In Changshu, the rent agreed upon by farmers and landlords is usually between eight dou and one shi per mu. This year, due to the slightly poorer harvest, it is determined by converting it to the black market price of rice. At that time, the conversion was about 3,000 to 4,000 yuan per mu. As for the original land and original landlord payment, it is now paid by the farmer on behalf due to the in-kind collection. For example, if the rent agreed upon by the farmer and the landlord is 4,000 yuan per mu, and the farmer pays one dou of land tax per year, calculated at the black market price, if the black market price of rice is 10,000 yuan per shi, and one dou is 1,000 yuan, then the farmer pays the landlord 3,000 yuan in rent with the temporary receipt for land tax.</p>
<p>On the landlord's side, when public security was not yet established in the past, there was no land rent to collect at all. This time, they have considerable land rent income, and they are very satisfied.</p>
<p>The landowners in Changshu have organized the Landowners' Association, which is on the same front as the purchasing merchants, assisting in the work of purchasing rice. In principle, this is very good, but secretly there may inevitably be a danger of exploiting farmers.</p>
<p>In the past, the burdens borne by farmers were simply land tax and land rent. At present, they are also directly shouldering the heavy responsibility of military and civilian needs under the wartime system. Therefore, the rights of the landowners, who depend on the land as parasites, should be strictly limited. If necessary, the amount of land rent should be stipulated, or the land rent burden borne by farmers should be waived due to poor harvests.</p>
<p>Four, This Year's Rice Harvest</p>
<p>According to the Jiangsu Office's investigation and publication, this year's rice harvest: "The summer harvest in the Suzhou area this year is estimated to be very abundant, but since May, there has been continuous rain, and in autumn, there has been damage from rice stem borers, resulting in a slight loss in the harvest, but overall, it is still better than last year."</p>
<p>In terms of Suzhou, Kunshan, and Yushan, Suzhou is still good, Changshu is inevitably affected by rice stem borers, causing a slight impact, the harvest in the first and second districts of Kunshan is poor, while the third, eighth, tenth, and eleventh districts are better. The harvest of early and late rice in the Jiangsu area is still good, while the middle rice inevitably suffers considerable damage.</p>
<p>As for the harm of rice stem borers, it is entirely due to the fact that last winter was not cold enough, and farmers did not turn over the soil, so the larvae were not exterminated, and in the autumn, they bred into adults, lurking in the base of the rice plants, absorbing nutrients, making it difficult for the rice to bear fruit.</p>
<p>Because this year's rice harvest is not consistent in various places, there are three points worth noting:</p>
<p>First, the current purchase of rice is calculated per mu, with a fixed amount, but there are also several places with poor harvests. The purchase quantity in areas with poor harvests should be considered and discounted, otherwise, this one-size-fits-all apportionment system is not very suitable in practice.</p>
<p>Second, this year is the year of increased production led by the late Chairman Wang, but the only ones who can truly practice this increased production movement are the cooperatives. Other institutions are not doing so, and even remain silent and indifferent to rural production, which is very regrettable. There are several places with poor harvests this year. Natural disasters and insect pests are certainly unavoidable, but in some places, the poor local political situation affects production, which should be a cause for alarm for the authorities.</p>
<p>Third, Kunshan has been designated as one of the rural construction experimental zones by the Rural Construction Implementation Committee since September 1 this year. It happened that rice stem borers were flying in the sky. While the officials in the court were talking about building the countryside and singing the slogan of construction, during the period of planning increased production on paper, the farmers were fighting with the rice stem borers in the fields. Only the cooperative personnel provided leadership, but it failed to prevent it universally, and the effect was reduced, causing Kunshan to suffer more severely. How can the officials in the court treat the farmers who returned defeated after a bitter battle, and be able to ask themselves without shame?</p>

<h3>Various Groups Held a Citizens' Celebration Meeting Yesterday to Celebrate the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>The City News Federation, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the China Film Company, six major civil groups, held a citizens' celebration meeting at the Grand Theater at 5:30 pm yesterday (8th) to celebrate the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. The Propaganda Department of this city and the three authorities of the Allied Powers in Shanghai, the Army, Navy, and Air Force, provided support. Chen Binsu, a member of the Municipal Government Advisory Committee, and Japanese political commentator Yosida Toyu were invited to give speeches. The attendees included Uchibuchi, the director of the Public Relations Department of the Japanese Army, Matsudaira, the director of the Information Department of the Embassy, Lieutenant Commander Shioda of the Fleet Public Relations Department, and the presidium: Tatsichiro Funatsu, Nagamasa Kawakita, Yoichi Osaka, Takashi Moriyama, Lantong Wen, Lvdeng Yuan, Kanghou Lin, Jiebai Jin, Jie Feng, Liqiu Xu, Riping Chen, Jingsu Huang, Feng Lu, Secretary-General Yunpeng Ren, and no less than several thousand people from all walks of life in this city. The ceremony began on time. The entire audience paid the highest respect to the flags of China and Japan. Then, Takashi Moriyama of the Continental News, the monthly director of the association, gave a closing speech. Following this, Yosida Toyu and Chen Binhe gave speeches one after another (Chen's speech is on the first page). Finally, "Spring River Regret" was screened, and the meeting adjourned at about 8 o'clock.</p>
<p>Yosida Toyu's Speech at the Citizens' Celebration Meeting</p>
<p>The full text of Yosida Toyu's speech at the Citizens' Celebration Meeting Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War is as follows:</p>
<p>Why Celebrate?</p>
<p>Today is the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, and I am honored to participate in the Shanghai citizens' celebration meeting held here. However, I would like to venture to ask everyone, why are we celebrating the Greater East Asia War today? On such an occasion, I raise such a seemingly inappropriate question, and of course I know that it is very impolite, but I have my reasons. Because I guess that among those present, there must be people who think, do we Chinese want to celebrate the Greater East Asia War? What have we gained in the three years of the Greater East Asia War? Before the start of the Greater East Asia War, the price of rice in Shanghai was only about 1,000 yuan, but today, the price of rice has risen to 30,000 yuan. Three years ago, there were corrupt officials, but they were not as rampant as they are today. Now, let alone large-scale corrupt officials, we can see small-scale corrupt officials everywhere on the streets of Shanghai. Three years ago, there was a "black market" for prices, but it was not as common as it is now. Now there are black market tickets for watching movies, black market tickets for taking the train, and black market tickets for taking the plane. Of course, there is black market rice. To be honest, now you can't buy anything at all without paying the black market price. The "black market" is now the only market where we can buy things. Such phenomena are all the result of the Greater East Asia War. In fact, the Shanghai Special Municipality itself has become a "big black market."</p>
<p>A certain German war theorist said, "War is the continuation of politics." If this sentence is correct, and if the current politics are to be extended when the Greater East Asia War is won, then we will be in even more trouble! Should we still celebrate the Greater East Asia War? This kind of thinking is quite reasonable and very justified. But I say that we still have to celebrate the Greater East Asia War, how can this be? On what grounds? Please allow me to explain.</p>
<p>Japanese Awareness</p>
<p>Some people say that war is inherently a special kind of digestion, and economic problems in society during wartime are unavoidable. So don't talk about simple economic difficulties, I also admit this statement, but the economic chaos caused by political incompetence is a big problem. During wartime, the people should suffer hardship, whether they suffer hardship or not is not a problem. When the majority of the people are on the verge of starvation, a small number of people are living an extremely lavish life, not doing any work, going in and out in cars, and eating fancy food every day. This kind of phenomenon is not right. If there is a very serious contradiction in the country, the people cannot fight as one, and as a result, that country will certainly not be able to win the war. So since the start of the Greater East Asia War, has there been such a phenomenon in China and Japan? Yes, there definitely is. A group of Chinese scoundrels colluded with rogue elements in Japan. Under very close Sino-Japanese collaboration, quite a few people have made a fortune from the national crisis. I don't need to talk much about this, because everyone knows it. But for those of you here, there is something you may not know or rarely know, and that is another aspect of the development of the Greater East Asia War, another new development. What is it? Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, many Japanese have realized that "if we want to defeat the British and Americans, we must eliminate this phenomenon." If we let this phenomenon slide, there is absolutely no talk of victory in the Greater East Asia War. We can't win the Greater East Asia War, which is by no means an easy war, if we don't want to imitate political reform. Japanese conscious elements and Chinese conscious elements must unite to solve the contradictory phenomena in society, and defeat the bad Sino-Japanese cooperation, then there is a way to win the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Sincere Sino-Japanese Cooperation</p>
<p>Perhaps the number of Japanese who think this way is increasing day by day. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese way of thinking has indeed changed in this way. Therefore, the fundamental Japanese way of thinking about China is completely different from before. In the past, most Japanese people almost couldn't see the Chinese, but now many Japanese have realized that without the sincere cooperation of the Chinese people, the Greater East Asia War will never have a good result. If we want to get the sincere cooperation of the Chinese people, the Japanese should truly respect China's independence and freedom. This kind of awareness on the Japanese side will certainly have a reaction in the minds of the Chinese. In the past, Chinese people who had no interest in the issue of Sino-Japanese cooperation are now showing considerable enthusiasm for Sino-Japanese cooperation and for overall peace. They think that if there are indeed more and more Japanese people who think this way since the start of the Greater East Asia War, then Sino-Japanese cooperation is hopeful, and we Chinese should change our view of the Japanese. Recently, I have seen a new development in the minds of both Chinese and Japanese people, and this new development is very valuable, because I believe that this new spiritual development is the basis for sincere Sino-Japanese cooperation in the future. I believe that in the course of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese awareness of this will become more and more profound. Then the Chinese understanding of the Japanese will become more progressive and more changed, and the views of the two countries will gradually converge. If this continues, on the last day of this war, I believe that sincere Sino-Japanese cooperation can be achieved. If sincere Sino-Japanese cooperation is successful, then defeating British and American imperialism is no problem at all. If British and American imperialism are defeated, then the liberation of all the peoples of Greater East Asia is no problem at all, and China's independence and freedom are also no problem at all. Therefore, the day the Greater East Asia War began was the day that such a major change in world history began. Therefore, no matter how great our current difficulties are, I cannot but advocate that we should still celebrate.</p>

<p>Dao Yi Bao Charity Exhibition Helps Students</p>
<p>The owner of Xu's Dao Yi Studio has been fond of collecting classics and newspapers since childhood. After adulthood, he became even more fond of famous calligraphy, inscriptions, and cultural relics. He aspired to be ancient and did not indulge in vulgarity. In his collections, he only sought the old without flaws, and only liked the charm without disliking the cold. He is different from other enthusiasts. Over the years, twenty years have passed. During this period, he has experienced many times of chaos, and in recent years, he has experienced world changes. The studio owner has been frugal and frugal, not commenting, but he is deeply concerned about the suffering and has the heart to help disaster relief, but he lacks the power to contribute. Therefore, he has decided to take out a part of his cherished collections, leaving some for his own enjoyment, and publicly auctioning the rest. After deducting the necessary expenses, he will donate the money to the scholarship funds of Shen Xin Liang Bao (two newspapers) and various public welfare charities they run. He also hopes that the great collectors will promote kindness, and be inspired by the news.</p>

<h3>The Greater East Asia General Mobilization Rally Solemnly Held Yesterday; Representatives From Various Countries Attended and Delivered Speeches</h3>

More than two thousand people attended. The rally began with an opening address by Chairman Li Fang, followed by Zhu reading the rally declaration. Subsequently, representatives from China, Liu Yangshan; Japan, Takenouchi Fumio; Manchukuo, Liu Gui; India, Nanak Jiangte; and the Philippines, Casiano, delivered speeches.

<p>Speech by the Chinese Representative</p>
<p>"Today is December 8th. On this day three years ago, Japan resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, launching the Greater East Asia War. The liberation movement of the Greater East Asian nations entered a new era. From then on, the nations of Greater East Asia rose up one by one to eliminate the oppression of Britain and the United States. Today, every nation in Greater East Asia has taken on the mission of war to achieve final victory. In the recent great naval and air battles in Taiwan and the Philippines, and the landing operation on Leyte Island, the enemy Americans sacrificed countless naval and air force soldiers and generals. The only price they obtained was Roosevelt's fourth election. However, the Philippines has a large area and is heavily defended. The enemy Americans are taking a risk in making this attempt, which creates an opportunity for their own destruction. Although the enemy is stubborn, they will hardly escape this predetermined doom. Today, we are holding this Greater East Asia Ethnic United Front General Mobilization Movement to seek victory in the Greater East Asia War. All ethnic groups, individuals, and organizations in Greater East Asia should use their utmost strength to promote it. The survival of the East Asian nations depends on this battle today. We cannot allow ourselves to steal life or fear death. We hope that our East Asian compatriots will work together and move forward."</p>
<p>Speech by the Japanese Representative</p>
<p>"Three years have passed since the holy war to liberate East Asia began. This Greater East Asia War, along with the European War, has spread to the entire world. It is a holy war to eliminate the common enemies of the world, Britain and the United States, and to liberate East Asia from their clutches. The profound will of heaven and the inevitability of history are helping us to defeat Britain and the United States and liberate East Asia. Looking back at the changes in the situation in the three years since the Greater East Asia War began, we have a sense of immense change. Not only have we recovered the territories and colonies of Britain and the United States, but independent countries that have been waiting for three hundred years have continued to be established in these regions. At the time when the Greater East Asia War broke out, there were only the independent countries of China, Japan, Manchukuo, and Thailand. But today, three years later, we have the Philippines and Burma, as well as the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, and the Dutch East Indies will soon be independent. Who could have foreseen these great achievements three years ago today? The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was a passive move for Japan from beginning to end. It was a last resort, a desperate struggle for the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, the past three years of war can be described as a considerable and tortuous hard fight. Now is the time to join forces with the Western European War to destroy Britain and the United States. In the Pacific, the Japanese army has repeatedly achieved great feats, and morale is increasing. Production is also gradually increasing. We can say that both the material and spiritual aspects are completely in a state of decisive battle. This point has been sufficiently proven by the recent naval and air battle in Taiwan and the great results on Leyte Island. At the same time, the war situation in Europe is also turning in favor of Germany. In other words, the victory of East Asia is just around the corner. The system for East Asian victory has been successfully established. For the sake of victory and the construction of a moral world, let us all rise up together! Now is the time for the one hundred million people of East Asia to rise up. Let us rise up!"</p>
<p>Speech by the Manchukuo Representative</p>
<p>"The Greater East Asia War is not just a war between our ally Japan and Britain and the United States. It is a war in which all the nations of Greater East Asia rise up together to annihilate our long-time enemies, the United States and Britain. The army, navy, and air force of our new ally Japan are fighting day and night on the front lines. Recently, the white-blade battle of the Sea Tiger Special Attack Force in Leyte Gulf was brave and divine, leading by example, which is truly touching to the East Asian nations behind the guns. The foundation for the final victory has been laid. The East Asian peoples should unite more closely, unite together, consolidate the total strength behind the guns, supply the government and people to cooperate with a strong belief in victory, and ensure war resources. The day when comprehensive peace in East Asia and the co-existence and co-prosperity and peaceful life in Greater East Asia can be realized is in the near future."</p>

<p>The celebratory football match commemorating the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, sponsored by the Shanghai News Zheng Quanhui, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens Welfare Association, the Industry and Commerce Friendship Association, and the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and supported by the Shanghai Football Association, was held yesterday at 3:00 PM at the Yiyi Stadium on Xianyang Road. Jilin played against the Three Provinces Jifeng team. As tickets were not sold, the audience was quite crowded. In order to strengthen their strength, the Jilin team temporarily invited Japanese players who had recently come to Shanghai from North China to help. Yesterday's performance was more delicate and exciting than before. Although the Three Provinces team was brave, they could not avoid defeat. The match was kicked off by Chen Riping, a member of the Municipal Advisory Committee. The Three Provinces team launched the first attack, with Xiao Ziwen dribbling the ball and attacking vigorously. Jilin's Songgang waited patiently and cleared the ball with one kick. Afterwards, the offensive was controlled by Jilin. After about 30 minutes, Ye Jingqi of the Three Provinces team was replaced by Zhang Fenggang. Jilin became even more rampant. Songgang Wuichi made a successful attack on the sideline, and Jinjing scored in the middle, giving Jilin a one-goal lead in the first half. After the change of sides, the Three Provinces team tried to counterattack and made some progress. Jin Lusheng made several wonderful constructions, but they were all blocked. Before long, the Three Provinces team came back again, with Meng Yiliang passing to the front. Jin Shengsheng passed to Gu Dirong, and Jilin was unable to defend. Gu made a clever sweep, and Jilin's center forward Fukui passed to Yamamoto. The Three Provinces team rushed to save the situation, but Jilin's Tokuyama slipped through an opening. Huang Renjie was caught off guard, and the ball went into the net. Shortly after, time ran out, and the Three Provinces team lost to Jilin by one to two.</p>

<p>Greater East Asia War Third Anniversary Special Issue No. 2</p>
<h3>A Record of the Second Year of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>— Wanzi (Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>Six Major Battles on Bougainville Island</p>
<p>Bougainville Island is the largest island in the Solomon Islands and serves as a barrier to Japan's southern naval base in Rabaul. The six naval and air battles that took place in the area from late October to early December were truly the fiercest battles of the year. The Americans were well-prepared for this battle, having transferred their Mediterranean fleet to the area, creating a massive force. On October 20th, the Americans first launched an air raid, followed by a landing on Mono Island, posing a significant threat to the fortress at the southern end of Bougainville Island. From the end of October, the Japanese side made every effort to respond with strong bombing.</p>
<p>Battles in the Bismarck Archipelago</p>
<p>The Bismarck Archipelago is located northwest of the Solomon Islands and contains two large islands: New Britain and New Ireland. The Americans initially launched continuous air raids on Rabaul, in the northwest corner of New Britain, after October. On December 15th, they landed at Cape Gloucester, and on the 25th, they attacked New Ireland.</p>
<p>Battles in New Guinea</p>
<p>On June 30th, American troops landed at Nassau Bay. The Japanese fought back with a small force, and the Americans suffered more than 5,600 casualties. On September 4th, American troops again attacked with the cooperation of the Australian army at Hollandia, employing mobile tactics and inflicting heavy damage. The two sides also engaged in fierce air battles over New Guinea.</p>
<p>(II) The Central Pacific Front</p>
<p>Naval and Air Warfare in the Gilbert Islands</p>
<p>In late November, American troops launched a large-scale offensive against the Gilbert Islands, resulting in four consecutive naval and air battles. The American force was centered around an aircraft carrier group. The American side suffered heavy casualties, with more than 3,700 killed and wounded, and seven aircraft carriers, one destroyer, and two cruisers sunk. The Japanese garrison and military personnel on Makin and Tarawa islands in the Gilbert Islands, totaling 4,500, all died in action.</p>
<p>Air Battles Over the Marshall Islands</p>
<p>On December 5th, aircraft from an American mobile force attacked Japanese positions in the Marshall Islands, and twenty aircraft were shot down. That evening, the Japanese surrounded and annihilated the mobile force. On the 21st, American aircraft attacked again and retreated after suffering losses.</p>
<p>(III) The North Pacific Front</p>
<p>The United States attached great importance to the invasion route in the North Pacific. In 1942, they completed the Alaska Highway and the Trans-Canada Highway, and increased the strength of various bases in the North Pacific, such as Dutch Harbor and Sitka, in an attempt to advance on the Japanese mainland from there. The Japanese military was unwilling to lag behind, so they occupied Kiska and Attu Island in mid-June of that year in order to contain the United States.</p>
<p>In 1943, the United States actively increased its troops in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands and repeatedly launched naval and air attacks to cut off the Japanese supply line. The Japanese forces held their positions on Kiska and Attu islands.</p>
<p>On May 12th, the United States landed on Attu Island. After inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese garrison, the isolated troops fought bitterly for thirty days. The Yamazaki unit then all died in action.</p>
<p>The United States then exerted great effort to bomb Kiska Island in mid-June. In early July, the Japanese military completed the construction projects in the northern region, such as the Kuril Islands, and safely withdrew from the island. In mid-August, the United States launched an air raid on the northernmost part of the Kuril Islands, with little success. On October 14th, the Japanese launched a surprise attack on Attu Island, destroying its military facilities.</p>
<p>(IV) The Burma Front</p>
<p>Burma is the barrier to Southwest China and the buffer zone to India. It is essential to the British and Americans, otherwise, losing Burma would open up India, and the aid to Chongqing would be insufficient. In 1942, the Japanese gave the British-Indian army a great counter-attack, and then advanced to the Salween River, establishing strong positions. Then on August 1st, the liberation of Burma was carried out, making it an independent country.</p>
<p>On May 13th, the Japanese army repelled 20,000 British troops at the border between India and Burma and secured their positions. They also crossed steep mountains and occupied Tengyue and Lameng on the border of Yunnan, China. The British army had no choice but to focus on defending India, while the Chongqing army arduously engaged in the struggle for the Yunnan-Burma Road.</p>
<p>In late December, the British-Indian army repeatedly attacked Akyab with superior forces, but the Japanese army defeated them. The Japanese army also circled around the Arakan Mountains for a surprise attack. The British-Indian army retreated, exhausted, and suffered heavy losses. The Japanese army air force also launched fierce bombing raids on eastern India in response. In the Battle of Arakan, the British-Indian army suffered 4,200 casualties.</p>
<p>After the Japanese army defeated the main force of the British-Indian army on the India-Burma border, they occupied Buthidaung and Maungdaw.</p>
<p>After the Quebec Conference in August, there was a strong call to "recover Burma." In order to strike first, the Japanese army entered the Ledge Water Gorge on October 15th and completed a large encirclement battle against the Salween (Nu) River bridgehead on the 17th. Chongqing sent 350,000 expeditionary troops to Yunnan and airlifted 50,000 elite troops to eastern India to strengthen the British-American defense line. The Japanese army started from Myitkyina, used mobile warfare to attack the front and flanks of the British-Chongqing army, forming a large encirclement.</p>
<p>By the end of 1943, the British-Indian army had also taken some action in the Buthidaung area, but they were all defeated.</p>
<p>(V) The China Front</p>
<p>After suffering defeats in the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States were eager to use the Chinese mainland to contain the Japanese army and serve as a base for a general counter-offensive. The following are some of the important battles on the Chinese mainland:</p>
<p>1. On the morning of February 16th, the Japanese army landed on the Leizhou Peninsula, Leizhou.</p>
<p>2. In late February, the Japanese army fought on Hainan Island.</p>
<p>3. In February and March, battles were fought north of Dongting Lake in Hubei and in the Su-Huai region of Jiangsu.</p>
<p>4. From April onwards, battles were fought in the three provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Hebei. Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying, commanders of the 24th Group Army of Chongqing, participated in the movement.</p>
<p>5. From March to late May, battles were fought to develop the Yichang Yangtze River route.</p>
<p>6. After early May, battles were fought in the western area of Dongting Lake.</p>
<p>7. From early July, battles were fought in the Taihang Mountains of Shanxi Province: after September, communist suppression operations were carried out throughout North China.</p>
<p>8. From October to December, battles were fought to occupy Changde. (The End)</p>

<h3>Written for the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>— Wang Shengjian</p>
<p>The history of the Yan and Huang peoples has seen many dangers. The nation is in trouble. The enemy's anger is shared by all people. The two words "peace" are known to all. Every commoner has a responsibility. All members of the same race must not doubt. Strengthen our borders with firm walls. Success is assured in no time.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>— Zheng Lansun</p>
<p>The righteous army deserves its name. The yellow race within the world forms a strong city. Early on, the retreat of three houses was taught. The accomplishment of great feats will be seen in the Eight Bǎs. The Milky Way will not tolerate the sound of cranes chirping. Let the sea try to expose running whales. The divine wind sweeps away leaves. It is easy to capture the Silver River before arming.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War with a Song of Congratulations</h3>
<p>— Dongguang Jia</p>
<p>The Han Dynasty became strong after defeating the Xiongnu. The Jin Dynasty perished after accepting the Five Barbarians. If Zhuge Liang had not pacified the southern barbarians, how could the five armies have emerged from Qishan? Since ancient times, internal stability has come before external resistance. Foreign races will ultimately harm the nation. The late Qing emperors were ignorant of the situation. The blue-eyed and yellow-bearded barbarians acted as they pleased. They have been tyrannical for over a hundred years. They were the culprits in the past and are the leaders of the invaders today. Warships open fire on the Pacific Ocean. Surging waves of terror approach. Relying on their power, they hoped to win. How could they know that warmongering would lead to disaster? Our East Asian allied nations stand for justice. Vowing to live and die with our race. Alliance with India to resist England, alliance with the Philippines to resist America. Three years of bloody fighting have destroyed the enemy's fortresses. Supporting the culture of five thousand years. Sweeping away the stench for forty thousand miles. Preserving East Asia relies on this. Alas. Completing the war is not accidental. It depends on the firm belief of our race. As long as the organization is sound. Grand victory is within sight. A billion people are mobilized. Vowing to face the stubborn enemy. Left hand holding a whip, right hand discarding a key. Breaking through the rain of bullets and smoke. The precious sword shines with fresh blood. Stabilizing the interior and resisting the exterior, following the example of our predecessors. East Asia will see the light again. May the flowers of freedom be good for ten thousand years.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>— Dong Weijian</p>
<p>The power of European winds and American rains is overwhelming. Trampling on China for over a hundred years. How much hatred for ceding land and paying indemnities. The blood debt is still fresh today.</p>
<p>It is not just China that has been robbed. The weak in Asia have been abused. The people of India, Burma, and Siam are all remnants after the scourge.</p>
<p>The combined strength of a billion hearts is not to be deceived. Our allied nations stand for justice and take the lead. We must firmly believe in the idea of living and dying together. This is the time to avenge our shame and seek survival.</p>
<p>Three sweeps are nearing completion. The annihilation of the enemy is now within your grasp. The army, navy, and air force all report victory. Asia will be returned to its masters.</p>
<h3>Encouraging the Generals and Soldiers on the Front Lines and Pre-Wishing Victory on the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhibin</p>
<p>The blade has not been idle for many years. Hundreds of tigers crossed the ocean, their fur stained with blood. The head does not betray the ambition of a man. The heart always holds heaven and earth. The strength of the masses can solidify new walls. Who does not love a good country? Surely, the day when divine martial arts will achieve success will come. Everywhere, a victory song will be played.</p>
<h3>The Third Year of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>— Zheng Chuan Nian</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a full three years have passed. Japan's past war records include the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the naval battle of Malaya, the capture of Hong Kong, the naval battle of the Philippines, the naval battle of Borneo, the capture of Singapore, the India-Burma campaign, the three naval battles of the Solomon Islands, the Battle of the Coral Sea, the raid on Midway Island, the six air and sea battles of Bougainville, and the four air and sea battles of the Gilbert Islands... Each campaign has been crowned with glorious victories, establishing an invincible position and dealing heavy blows to Britain and the United States. In the past, Britain and the United States also adopted a strategy of avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, advancing steadily. However, now, due to their shortcomings in military, political, and other aspects, they have revealed the most anxious state. The United States' strategic emphasis on "East Asia surpassing Europe" has risen sharply, and they are hastily preparing for a total counter-offensive in the Pacific. They often proclaim that "there is more than one road to Tokyo," but Japan is well-prepared and ready to strike back in all areas.</p>
<p>Their roads to total counter-offensive: the first is the northern route from the Aleutian Islands. Due to terrain and climate, this route is impassable. The second is the route of the Soviet Union attacking Japan. Japan and the Soviet Union have maintained friendly relations all along, and the diplomatic situation remains unchanged, so this is merely wishful thinking. The third is the counter-offensive route to Sumatra, Malaya, and all the way to Vietnam, which is long and circuitous, and thus very unfavorable. The fourth is launching from India and Burma, which is tantamount to an isolated army breaking through encirclement, contrary to their wishes. The fifth is the counter-offensive line towards Java and Borneo. The sixth is the route from Australia, New Guinea, and on to the Philippines and Taiwan, directly landing on the southern mainland of China. Another is the seventh offensive line from the Marshall Islands, echoing the Mariana Islands and the Philippines and Taiwan. The latter two are the most suitable. Under the leadership of MacArthur and Nimitz, fierce battles involving the main fleet are underway, while also bombing the Japanese mainland to enhance the effect.</p>
<p>In the past year, the United States has been driving forward recklessly. In mid-June, they crudely used their mobile units to land and fight on Saipan, Guam, Tinian, and Palau Islands. Although they were fortunate enough to succeed, they suffered heavy casualties, incurring a loss outweighs the gain. In these campaigns, the United States suffered a total loss of more than 60,000 personnel. The Japanese army fought bravely, inflicting heavy attacks. The Saipan operation lasted for forty days, while Guam and Tinian were extended to seventy days, eventually resulting in the complete sacrifice of all personnel, giving the Greater East Asian countries great inspiration and admiration. For strategic reasons, the Japanese main force maintained a very prudent attitude, waiting for an opportunity to act and not acting rashly. However, the United States underestimated Japan's military strength, and became increasingly aggressive, acting foolishly in the western Pacific. After the beginning of October, the United States even assembled all its forces in the Pacific, including Halsey's Third Fleet, Spruance's Fifth Fleet, Kinkaid's Seventh Fleet, and other MacArthur units, all coveting Taiwan and the Philippines. Japan suddenly launched two powerful annihilation battles in the waters off Taiwan and the eastern Philippines, almost completely destroying the main force of the American fleet. Although the Americans have landed more than ten divisions on Leyte Island in the Philippines, the American defense lines have been cut off due to the brave fighting of the Japanese army, and the situation is becoming increasingly hopeless.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the major battles of the Greater East Asia War in 1944:</p>
<p>Pacific Theater</p>
<p>In the second half of 1943, after the United States established its system, it actively prepared for a counter-offensive, starting from Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. Afterwards, it advanced towards the Gilbert Islands, and devoted itself to the fierce battles in the Marshall Islands. The situation of a decisive battle in the Pacific became increasingly clear.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers on Kwajalein and Roi Islands Sacrificed Their Lives</p>
<p>In January, starting in the morning, powerful American mobile units continuously attacked Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, and the entire Marshall Islands. On February 1, they landed on Kwajalein and Roi. The Japanese naval and land forces jointly defended, inflicting great damage on the enemy. With a small force, they faithfully performed their duties. On February 6, a total of 6,500 army and navy troops and military personnel on the two islands heroically sacrificed their lives. The fiery speech of Japanese Navy Minister Shimada resonated deeply.</p>
<p>Bougainville Campaign</p>
<p>The Japanese army on Bougainville Island launched attacks on the enemy forces holding the defensive line near Torokina from the beginning of March. The enemy abandoned 4,000 bodies, and 37 cannons and other military supplies were captured. The Japanese army suffered about 30 casualties. The garrison forces defended the island tenaciously, and the fighting gradually intensified since the end of July. On August 10, the Japanese army ambushed the landing enemy in the Kapo River area.</p>
<p>Air and Sea Battle of the Mariana Islands</p>
<p>In mid-June, most of the enemy American Pacific Fleet appeared near the Mariana Islands. The Japanese air force attacked them, and by the 20th, they had sunk one enemy battleship and one destroyer, two cruisers; destroyed more than four aircraft carriers, two battleships, four cruisers, and shot down more than 300 aircraft. To support the fierce fighting of the Saipan garrison, they continued to fight bravely. By the 30th, the results were significant. In addition to sinking one enemy battleship, two cruisers and destroyers, and destroying two aircraft carriers and destroyers, they also shot down 211 enemy aircraft. A part of the Japanese Combined Fleet, in order to preemptively strike, surrounded the enemy mobile unit on the other side of the Mariana Islands on the 19th. By the evening of the 20th, they had sunk five aircraft carriers (including the new Bunker Hill), one battleship, and shot down more than 100 enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Battle of Saipan</p>
<p>In early June, the American mobile force appeared east of the Mariana Islands. 190 carrier-based aircraft bombed Saipan. On the 12th, the island was attacked again. On the 14th, the Americans, with more than ten aircraft carriers, eight battleships, and more than seventy transport ships, loaded with soldiers, carried out a landing. The Japanese garrison fought fiercely to repel the invaders. On the afternoon of the 15th, a part of the American army occupied the area near Aslito airfield, gradually expanding the area. The Japanese army engaged in close combat, destroying more than ten tanks. On the 17th, the Japanese army retreated again due to intense artillery fire. On the 23rd, the island's water source was completely destroyed. On the 25th, the Japanese army charged into the enemy lines with artillery shells, stunning the Americans. The next night, the island's highest point, Mount Tapochau, was captured, and the situation became unfavorable for the Japanese army. On the 28th, the Japanese artillery fire was completely destroyed. On the morning of July 7, the Japanese army, with naval, land, and air forces united as one, launched a final, fierce attack, and finally the entire army was killed in battle. The enemy American forces considered this battle the most difficult in the Pacific campaign. The American army suffered more than 15,000 casualties. However, after that, there were still surviving Japanese soldiers on the island who carried out guerrilla warfare in difficult circumstances and died heroically. Afterwards, the Japanese army continuously bombed the enemy airfield on the island.</p>
<p>Fierce Battles on Guam and Tinian Islands</p>
<p>In mid-June, naval, land, and air battles between the two sides around Saipan, such as Guam, Tinian, and Rota, also gradually intensified. Due to the small number of Japanese troops, they were finally forced to allow the enemy to land. In mid-July, the enemy forces on Guam suffered heavy damage in the central area of Akashi Street and Showa Street after landing. In the northern district of Tinian, since the enemy landed, the Japanese army fought bravely to prevent the powerful enemy forces from advancing southward, inflicting heavy losses on them. By mid-July, the enemy had suffered 4,900 casualties. By the end of July, the enemy forces broke into the last defensive line of the Japanese army in the southern part of the island, and the battle lines became intricate. From July 21 to September 27, for a total of seventy days, the Japanese army fought alone, endured hardships, and faced extreme adversity. In the end, all the garrison forces heroically died in battle.</p>
<p>Battle of the Palau Islands</p>
<p>Enemy fleets and aircraft groups had repeatedly raided the Caroline Islands. In mid-July, 750 aircraft arrived, and a total of 110 were shot down or destroyed. In early September, more than 100 enemy land-based aircraft raided Palau and Yap Islands. On September 15, the enemy MacArthur landed on Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands. The Japanese army successively launched fierce attacks on the enemy, and the artillery battles between the two sides were extremely fierce. On the morning of the 17th, under the cover of artillery fire from the enemy mobile force, they began to land again. The Japanese garrison on Palau fought bravely, annihilating many enemies, and firmly defended the central highlands and the northern cape. The enemy suffered about 50,000 casualties, and more than 60 ships were sunk. On the 18th, the Japanese army launched a clever night attack, sinking more than 50 ships and 15 tanks. Afterwards, the enemy suffered additional casualties of more than 20,000. The Japanese army, with a small number of troops, stubbornly resisted, continuing to engage in fierce close combat, causing great fear to the American army. The landing and seizure battle on this island truly broke the previous records of battles in the Pacific.</p>
<p>After landing on Angaur, the Americans suffered heavy losses, while the Japanese shortened the battle line to repel the enemy. The Americans were repeatedly repulsed fiercely. In early September, the Japanese army even used close combat attacks, causing the enemy to suffer heavy casualties and retreat in shock.</p>
<p>New Guinea Campaign</p>
<p>In late April, the Japanese army withdrew from the Madang area, defeating the superior enemy. Afterwards, they fought a major battle with about one division of the enemy that had landed, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. The Japanese had overcome obstacles between Wewak and Aitape. On July 13, the Japanese army began attacking the enemy positions on the banks of the Lupu River in New Guinea. The enemy forces near Sarmi were deployed near Wakde Island in mid-August. From April to August, the Japanese battle results were: 2,079 enemy bodies abandoned, 2,650 casualties, 48 aircraft shot down, 45 destroyed, and a large number of other military supplies captured.</p>
<p>Biak Island Area</p>
<p>In late May, the American mobile force raided Biak Island, northwest of New Guinea. First, they bombarded it with heavy artillery, and then landed with a division of troops. The Japanese army launched fierce counter-attacks day and night, defeating them. Later, the enemy's troops were reinforced to two divisions. After acquiring bases such as Makassar and Hollandia, they were in an advantageous position, but the Japanese army frequently and cleverly bombed them, causing the enemy to suffer considerable losses. However, the Japanese army ultimately defended against the enemy with a small number of troops, and the Japanese army completed its mission in the Biak area by July 2.</p>
<p>Halmahera Island Campaign</p>
<p>Regarding Morotai Island in the Moluccas, after about one division of enemy troops landed in mid-September, the Japanese ground forces on the island immediately counter-attacked. Using close combat and self-sacrificing tactics, they suppressed the expansion of the enemy forces, killing and wounding more than 1,000 enemy troops by the end of October. Starting in November, the Japanese air force launched a more fierce attack on the enemy positions on the island, achieving great results.</p>
<p>Naval Battle East of Taiwan</p>
<p>The enemy Americans were ignorant of current events, and kept thinking that they could win inch by inch in island hopping operations. Underestimating Japan's strength, they pressed close to Japan's inner defense line, simply being arrogant and unbridled. In early October, they even coveted Taiwan, bombing it with more than a thousand aircraft for a hundred days. The enemy American fleet was the Third Fleet of the Pacific, commanded by Halsey, the most elite mobile unit. A fierce naval battle broke out on the night of the 12th. The Japanese army quickly won victories in all battles. The Japanese General Headquarters announced the battle results on the 16th as follows: ten aircraft carriers, two battleships, three cruisers, and one destroyer sunk; three aircraft carriers, one battleship, four cruisers, and eleven unidentified ships damaged. This was truly an unprecedented achievement, comparable to the Russo-Japanese War. After this crushing defeat, Nimitz bombed Manila on the 15th in order to salvage the situation and cover the safe retreat, but the Japanese army continued to attack them, sinking one aircraft carrier in the waters east of Manila, and shooting down 30 aircraft.</p>
<p>Landing Battle of the Philippines</p>
<p>Although the enemy Americans suffered a miserable defeat in Taiwan, they were still ferocious and unyielding. Not hesitating to adopt the "reverse warfare method", on October 18, they used the remaining enemy air force's fleet supplemented by transport convoys to invade Leyte Island in the southern Philippines.</p>
<p>The military force they sent consisted of the remnants of the Third Fleet led by Halsey, the Fifth Fleet led by Spruance, the Seventh Fleet led by Kinkaid, and the Australian fleet combined. They originally planned to land and occupy the Philippine Islands in one fell swoop. Little did they know that they would encounter fierce attacks by the Japanese navy in Leyte Gulf. The enemy landing forces and fleet were repeatedly defeated. As of October 27, the battle results that had been determined included the sinking of more than 130 enemy ships, including 39 aircraft carriers, 10 battleships, and 17 cruisers.</p>
<p>Leyte Island Landing Situation: On the 18th, the American side carried out air raids on the Visayas region and Luzon Island, etc., and began naval gun bombardment in the afternoon. On the 19th, a part of the American army landed on Cabalian in the southern part of Leyte Island, and under the cover of artillery fire, they planned to land near Tacloban, but were repelled by the Japanese army. On the 20th, the enemy army landed again successfully, but most of the boats and ships were sunk in the sea. After the 21st, the American bridgehead on Leyte was extremely small, and the three divisions of troops that had landed fought desperately, suffering heavy casualties. Afterwards, the force increased to five divisions to ten divisions, and the supply was extremely difficult. The Japanese Kamikaze Corps attacked the enemy convoys on the island with "crashing tactics", achieving remarkable results. The key areas of the island were protected by two lines of defense: one from Alangalang to Binolhoan, and one from Carigara to Nuro, surrounding the highlands. The two sides are engaged in fierce bayonet fighting.</p>
<p>In early November, the Japanese Kamikaze attack force fiercely attacked the enemy forces on the sea east of northern Luzon Island in the Philippines, sinking five enemy ships. The Japanese submarines responded by sinking three aircraft carriers and one destroyer. The Japanese Eighth Flying Group launched a fierce attack on Leyte Gulf on the 27th, sinking and destroying more than ten enemy ships.</p>
<p>Burma Theater</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Burma took the initiative, and since the invasion, has been victorious in every battle. Moreover, the Indian National Army cooperated and shouted the slogan of marching into the motherland and driving out Britain and the United States, adding a unique color to the Greater East Asia War. On January 8 of this year, the Free India Government moved from Singapore to Burma. Its mission will surely be completed on schedule. The following is a description of the India-Burma war situation:</p>
<p>Advancing into India</p>
<p>According to the announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters: On March 8, the Japanese powerful forces in Burma, together with the Indian National Army, attacked the British Indian army near the Chin Hills. Another unit, together with the Indian National Army, crossed the Chindwin River near Homalin on March 15. On March 23, the Japanese army attacked the British Indian 17th Division near Tonzang, and supported the Indian National Army. In mid-March, they entered India. The enemy had invaded northern Burma with airborne troops, and the Japanese army pursued and suppressed them. In the northwest of Myitkyina, they ambushed the Chinese army and the British and American allied forces that had invaded Shangfukung. The Japanese army retreated from the Myitkyina area in mid-August. Starting in early November, they launched a counter-offensive in the Myitkyina area, inflicting heavy losses. The water of the Irrawaddy River turned completely red.</p>
<p>Imphal Campaign</p>
<p>The Japanese army on the central India-Burma border launched an offensive towards the Imphal Plain with its main force in late March. At a point about 40 kilometers north of the plain, they had cut off the enemy's important supply line, the Palel-Kohima road. On the morning of April 6, they occupied Kohima, a key point on the Imphal-Dimapur road. On May 11, the Japanese air force's large formations destroyed the Imphal airfield and city streets. At the same time, in order to open up the supply route to the area, the Allied forces fought a major bloody battle around Kohima, and continuously transferred troops in Chittagong and Shillong. After the rainy season, their renewed activities suffered heavy losses, with 40,000 dead and more than 230,000 wounded.</p>
<p>Japanese Garrison on the Yunnan Border Sacrificed Their Lives</p>
<p>The battle in Yunnan became extremely fierce, for two reasons: First, the anti-Axis forces were urgently carrying out construction in the eastern border of India, thereby containing the Japanese army. Second, they attempted to open up the Ledo Road and reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road. The Japanese garrison forces in Ramu and Tengyue inflicted heavy losses on the Chinese army in Yunnan, making a significant strategic contribution. After completing their mission, the two garrisons finally heroically sacrificed their lives, and their great deeds were announced by the Ministry of the Army on September 20.</p>
<p>Battle on the Nu River Front</p>
<p>Since the Chinese army crossed the Nu River in mid-July, it has been determined to recapture the key points, suffering huge losses, and the supply of supplies has been extremely difficult. By early August, the Chinese army had abandoned 2,148 bodies.</p>
<p>Battle of Longling</p>
<p>The Chinese army launched fierce attacks on Tengyue, Ramu, and Longling with more than ten divisions in the rainy season, but were repelled. In mid-October, the Chinese army transferred its most elite unit, the 200th Division of the Fifth Army, to the vicinity of Longling to launch a counter-offensive, but was repelled by the Japanese army. Also, when the 200th Division attacked Mabai, it was ambushed and raided by 16 Japanese soldiers, and achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>China Theater</p>
<p>Britain and the United States are shouting themselves hoarse in the Greater East Asia War, engaging in a counter-offensive with trepidation. In order to contain the Japanese army, they are using the power of Chongqing on the Chinese mainland to fight against the Japanese army, so that they can catch a breath. Under the strategy of the Greater East Asia, the Japanese army had no choice but to advance step by step in order to destroy the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Hands Over Guangzhou Bay</p>
<p>On February 16 of last year, the elite forces of the Japanese army in southern China landed on the Leizhou Peninsula in a surprise attack. On the 21st, they entered Guangzhou Bay, concluded a Japan-Vietnam defense agreement, and smoothly promoted the military and political affairs in the area, thereby ensuring security. On March 1 of this year, the Japanese army in southern China declared the removal of military and political affairs in the Guangzhou Bay area, incorporating it under the jurisdiction of the Guangdong Provincial Government, officially making it a peace zone. Chen Yaozu, the head of Guangdong Province, signed an agreement with the commander of the Japanese army, Huisinan, transferring it to the jurisdiction of the National Government. The Japanese army now only bears the mission of preparing for combat.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Opens Up the Pinghan Railway</p>
<p>The Japanese army crossed the Yellow River and launched an offensive on April 18. Within three weeks, they captured Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Yancheng, Suiping, Queshan, and the Pinghan Railway was connected from north to south. The Japanese army then pointed its troops westward, capturing Yiyang, Xiangcheng, Yuxian, Dengfeng, Rongyang, Zhishi and other places, and attacked Luoyang from the north and south. The Chinese and American air forces gradually became active, and the Japanese army shot down several P-40 type aircraft.</p>
<p>Henan-Hunan-Guangxi Campaign</p>
<p>On May 24, the Japanese army launched a general offensive on Luoyang and occupied it the next day. The Japanese army in Hunan captured Changsha and Liling on the 18th, which was the third time they had fallen. Then they advanced southward and attacked Hengyang. By July 26, the two sides had fought fiercely for 29 days. The Chongqing authorities announced on the 24th that the Japanese army had entered Hengyang city; a new fierce battle was launched in the northern part of the city. The Japanese headquarters announced that it had completely occupied the city on August 8. Fang Xianjue, the commander of the 10th Army of the Chinese army, and others surrendered to peace.</p>
<p>Guangxi Campaign</p>
<p>After the Japanese army captured Hengyang, they advanced southwest along the Xiang-Gui Railway. On October 9, they entered Guangxi Province, occupied Daoxian on the 13th, and Quanzhou the next day. On the 24th, they reached Guanyang, eighty kilometers northeast of Guilin, and from there launched an offensive to the southwest. They captured Guilin on November 10 and then entered Liuzhou. The aviation fortress in the southwest was thus completely destroyed. The southeast half and several southwestern provinces were isolated from Chongqing. They occupied Huaiyuan on November 22; and Nanning on the 24th.</p>
<p>The Japanese army, along the Qian-Gui Railway, attacked Jinchengjiang and Sachih on November 20, and captured Nandan on the 28th. Together with the troops that broke through Liming Pass and entered Guizhou Province, they continued to advance. On December 2, the Central News Agency reported: The headquarters of the 14th Air Force stationed in Chongqing believed that the Japanese army had the potential to attack Guiyang, the provincial capital.</p>
<p>Currently, the Chongqing authorities, because Guizhou Province has reported a critical situation, in order to actively rescue it, have specially deployed two divisions of the 76th Army and two divisions of the 79th Army in the provincial border area, and deployed the 196th Division of the 76th Army and a part of the 90th Army near Nanzong, occupying the dangerous mountains and resisting fiercely and arduously.</p>
<p>Southern Zhejiang Campaign</p>
<p>On August 27, the elite Japanese army stormed into Lishui County. Lishui is a transportation hub and the forefront of the supply route for air raids on Japan. The Japanese army occupied Wenzhou's important military base along the line and attempted to use it as a base for obstructing the route. Unexpectedly, the American side planned to...</p>
<p>Fuzhou Landing Campaign</p>
<p>On September 27, the Japanese army and navy cooperated with each other and launched the Fuzhou campaign again, carrying out a landing. This important coastal hub in the southeast fell into the hands of the Japanese army again. It is recorded that Fuzhou was once captured in April 1941.</p>
