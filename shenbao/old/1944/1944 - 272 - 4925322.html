<h3>太平洋戰局的展望</h3>
<p>問：太平洋方面的戰事，近日來已漸趨白熱化，美國以海軍機動部隊，不惜任何犧牲，進攻太平洋上的蕞爾小島，敢問美國何以作如此冒險的行動？　　答：美國向來是一個自由主義的國家，此次參戰以後，國內也已漸趨戰時體制。在參戰初期，戰爭氣氛濃厚，可是戰爭一旦延長，國內因戰爭所受到的影響，亦漸漸暴露，人民經過數年來戰事的影響，大有壓戰的傾向。所以此次美國軍隊在太平洋的新作戰，毌寗說是對於國內人民的一針強心劑。此其一。今年美國舉行大總統選舉，羅斯福已經打破往例開始競爭其四選運動。此次不但共和黨的杜威是他有力的對手，並且民主黨內部也有反對羅斯福的團體存在，所以四選的前途是滿佈暗礁的。此次所以發動太平洋方面的[新攻勢]，其最大原因還是在藉此以有利於他的四選。此其二。因此，美國乃不惜巨大犧牲，來作一次冒險的舉動。　　問：那末，美國這種的冒險舉動，是否對於美國作戰的前途有利呢？　　答：此次美國在菲律賓東南方的培里琉島登陸，雖然一小部份登陸成功，但是依舊不能有補戰局。現在美國在太平洋上最大的海空軍根據地，當然是夏威夷羣島；今夏威夷離培里琉島有四千餘海里，其海軍補給綫是成爲極嚴重的問題。現在假定美國有一師團兵力，則接濟此一師團的武器和物質，至少須要三十萬噸的船舶；按照軍事上的常識說，攻守之間的比率是三與一之比，則假定日本軍隊的兵力是一百師的話，則美國軍隊若欲與日本軍隊決戰，則至少非有三百師不可，此時所需要的船舶運輸，將增加到九千萬噸之多，美國雖爲物資豐富的國家，但是否有此能力來供給如此龐大的船團，則成絕大疑問。所以，海面戰綫趨是延長，對於美國越是不利。　　問：目前美國在太平洋的戰略趨勢，似乎分爲三方面：第一，進攻菲律賓，截斷日本與南洋羣島之間的聯絡路；第二，進攻小笠原羣島，圖窺日本本土；第三，施行空襲戰術，以圖消耗日本生產能力。未知尊意以爲何如？　　答：關於第一點，剛才已經講過，美國戰綫越長，前途越是不利。譬如美國佔領大宮迭尼安兩島，在兵力上雖佔絕對優勢，但仍須費六十餘日的激戰後，方纔得逞；如此廣大的菲律賓羣島，將來作戰的困難，更可想見。關於第二個戰略，那更含有無窮的危險性。美國海軍艦隊越是接近日本本土，則離開日本的航空圈越近，也就是美國艦隊全軍覆滅的機會愈多。海軍的作戰方式與陸上戰鬬絕對不同，海軍的主體是艦隊，而艦隊的得失，就可以決定整個的戰局。日俄戰爭的時候，誰也意料不到帝俄會大敗的，可是波羅的海艦隊在對馬海峽的全軍覆滅，就是整個帝俄的致命傷，也就是日本戰勝的最大關鍵。現在美國要進攻小笠原羣島，甚至企圖進窺日本本土，勢非派遣有力的海軍機動部隊游弋於日本近海不可，這就是日本擊滅敵人的絕好機會。加以美國艦隊駛近日本本土附近時，更進入了日本的強力航空圈，無論以量來說，無論以質來說，再無論以航空的速率·時間·距離來說，對於日本是絕對有利的。試問單恃航空母艦或中國大陸上的少數飛機，怎麼與日本本土內的飛機相對抗？美國的艦隊若失去制空權，海軍是絲毫無力的。等到美國艦隊全軍覆沒的一天，就是日本得到勝利的一天。　　問：那末，美國若利用空襲的戰術，專事轟炸日本的本土，則戰局又怎樣呢？　　答：美國縱然可轟炸日本本土，但此種轟炸方式決不能與英美大規模轟炸柏林漢堡時所可比擬。第一，英倫本土離德國僅一小時的距離，第二，英美在英國有強大的空軍，強大的根據地，所以轟炸德國並不十分困難。但是，美國假如要對日本施行空襲戰術，試問美國那裹來的多數飛機？那裹來的強大根據地？還有那裹來的餘裕時間？結果，美國倘若以空襲來作爲部份的游擊戰則可，若欲大規模的來轟炸日本，事實上是絕對不可能。　　問：如此說來，美國進攻菲律賓已是不利，圖窺日本本土是絕對危險。施行空襲戰術又未能得逞，結果戰事的主動權是被日本把握，前途當然對美國不利了。　　答：不錯。目前的戰局趨勢是對美國不利，這不但我們如此主張，美國當局亦不得不承認戰局前途的困難。不但戰局的前途對日有利，日本國內的戰時體制，亦日益健全。如企業的完全軍需化，國民的總動員，防空態勢的確立，都足以證明國內戰時體制之日益強化。加以小磯內閣成立以來，日本國內已上下打成一片，人民團結一致，無論在物資上，精神上，確已向必勝之途邁進，太平洋戰局的明朗化，爲期不遠了。</p>
<h3>襲太平洋各島敵空軍蒙重創</h3>
<p>兩月中擊落百七十餘架　　中部太平洋基地一日中央社電　小笠原君島父島二十八日敵機二十架來襲，被擊落一架。是日下午特魯克島敵機十餘架來襲，被擊落三架。帛琉羣島哥羅爾島有二十架來襲，南鳥島二十九日敵機數架來襲，被擊落一架。　　西南太平洋基地一日中央社電　哈爾馬黑拉方面日守軍邀擊來襲之敵機，戰鬥日益激烈，自七月二十七日至九月二十五日邀擊敵機之綜合戰果如次：○擊落B24型機三十七架，B25型機十三架，P38型機二架，P47型機四架，F4F型機三十架，共計八十六架。○擊毀Ｂ２４型機六十七架，B25型機二架，P38型機五架，P47型機二架，F4F型機六架，共八十二架以上，共計擊落擊毀敵機百六十八架。</p>
<h3>培里琉等島日軍奮戰中</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電茲分誌日軍最近在南方之戰況如次：○培里琉島方面，敵軍一部於二十六日在培里琉島北端及格里特布斯島登陸後，該島日守軍當即予以邀擊，刻仍在激戰中。但敵對該島仍連日發砲轟擊，極其熾烈。二十六日培里琉島日守軍，當敵因日機隊轟炸而呈混亂之時，會發動肉搏攻擊，敢行衝殺，予敵以重創，使敵陣營深爲震憾。二十七日復發動衝擊，收獲極大之成果，但其詳情仍未判明，惟僅就該挺進隊一部所獲戰果而觀，即已鹵獲迫擊砲二門·重機槍二挺·破壞重機槍一挺，殺傷敵兵甚衆。并於是日對水府山觀測山施以猛烈砲擊，但優勢之敵仍來攻水府山，統因受重創而完全潰退。此外敵更以戰車二十輛·野砲四門·侵入該山之北方地區，日守軍當即予以邀擊，刻仍在激戰中。惟截至二十日止，敵戰車在該島已被擊毀甚多（計十八日被擊毀四輛，十九日被擊毀五輛）。又於二十七日培里琉島安格維爾島之敵空軍，亦會以飛機九十架來襲帛琉島及克羅米，惟經日守軍邀擊後，即被擊落二架，重毀六架。日軍在安格維爾島方面仍扼守該島西北部高地之要點，與敵進行激鬥中。摩羅泰方面日軍仍繼續展開肉搏戰，使敵陣營深爲震驚，同時日機隊更呼應陸上部隊，不分晝夜轟炸敵登陸地點附近，炸毀敵中型運輸船一艘　收獲相當戰果。并於二十六日傍晚二十七日拂曉及二十七日夜，連續轟擊敵登陸地點附近，予敵以重創。</p>
<h3>長生氏談戰局持必勝信念</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　日本郵船上海支店長生駒寔氏，前會屢次視察中部太平洋各地，頃聞大宮島及迭尼安島日軍民全體壯烈成仁，經大本營于三十日發表，爰對今後戰局之動向發表觀感如次：[余與大宮迭尼安兩島守備部隊中人素極相　，今聞全體壯烈犧牲之訊，不勝扼腕，然此事絕不動搖日本之決戰態勢。吾人對于過去塞班島之役，在局部之作戰中，雖不能忽視敵人之優勢，但戰鬥與戰局之歸趨，決不能渾爲一談。此次敵美固持其優勢之物量來犯，然因補給路綫之延長，食糧彈藥補充之困難，其犧牲數目與日俱增。查美軍在塞班島之役，平均每一方公里損失五十六名，而今日在培里琉島所受之損失，激增至四百十二名，美軍不惜慘重犧牲，傾師繼續來犯，純爲羅斯福企求達到四屆競選總統狂妄野心之具體表現，尤以大宮島原爲美國所屬之關島，故[收復失地]自爲最有効之宣傳工具。然美軍以數十倍之兵力與大批之兵艦飛機，克此蕞爾小島，費時竟達七十餘日之久，則如何能進攻路途遙遠防務堅固之日本，其重重困難，美國當不難體騐而知。在另一方面，敵美一想情願之中國大陸作戰，亦因日軍先發制人在湖南獲得空前之成功，其迷夢已澈底粉碎，故羅斯福爲求收之桑榆，乃企圖奪回大宮島及迭尼安島，以作誇張之朦蔽宣傳，另一方面仍不放棄攻日之希望。總之，自經小磯內閣成立以來，設立戰爭指導會議，積極推行飛機增產，各方面成績斐然，全國上下對于最後勝利，均有堅定之信念。吾人際此對戰局重要階段，必須一致奮起擊滅驕敵，以慰英靈，行見美國之焦慮將隨對日作戰愈演愈深，而日本必勝之信念反愈形堅定也。]</p>
<h3>兩島軍民殺廠成仁顯示日本傳統精神</h3>
<p>緒方總裁發表談話　　東京一日中央社電日情報局總裁諸方氏，三十日發表談話，其大意謂：關於大宮島及迭尼安島日本居民之消息，大本營已有所發表，茲再綜合當地之來電，略述其　　。該兩島日本住民，即　日軍共同致力防衛，當七月敵軍開始攻擊時，更不分老幼，凡能作戰者悉協力日軍攻擊優勢之敵軍，從事奮戰。迭尼安日本居民約一萬五千人，其中十六歲至四十五歲之壯男，約三千五百人，組成數隊義勇軍，與軍士通力合作，堅持助戰，作壯烈陣亡。至於老弱婦孺等，則爲避戰火，羣集於該島之加羅里納斯地區，援助日軍作戰，當敵軍迫進將及後防綫時，不願陷敵受辱，悉行自決。大宮島日本居民約五百人，亦與迭尼安島相同，協力軍隊迎擊強敵，與全體將士同具守護皇土不屈不撓之氣魄，因此完全顯示吾人誓必殺滅宿敵，以遂殉職將領未竟之素志。</p>
<h3>晉省日軍九月份戰果</h3>
<p>太原一日中央社電晉省日軍，九月中旬討伐戰，收容渝軍棄屍九九一名，俘虜二五五名，鹵獲手槍二四六支，地雷一四四發，手溜彈八一個，輕機槍十六架，迫擊砲三尊，洋砲五三尊。毀滅渝軍防衛局一，兵營二，被服庫四，合作社三，糧秣庫三，物資供給所三，碉堡三，被服廠一，兵器修理廠一，及區分署一。</p>
<h3>日轟炸機隊襲柳州南寗</h3>
<p>炸毀渝機三十六架　　中國大陸日軍某基地一日中央社電　日轟炸機隊，二十九日以其主力，再攻擊柳州，另一隊急襲南寗，總共炸毀渝機三十六架，設使二處，茲分誌詳情如次：○襲柳州中之當先一架日機，利用月光，略事偵察，當即對滑行路東南角之掩蓋壕，加以轟炸，命中壕內四發動機之飛機兩架，使其起火。日機隨之更以此炎燄爲目標，集中轟炸，是役共損害渝機十三架，計炸燬渝大型機五架，內四發動機者二架，小型機三架，設施二處，（一爲燃料庫，一似爲飛機庫），炸毀大型機二架，小型機三架。○另一隊日機，在飛襲南寗途中，排除駐渝美戰門機之妨害，及渝方高射砲火之射擊，轟炸飛機停留地區，當即收獲戰果如次：○渝機被擊毀而致起炎焚燒者，計有四發動機大型機四架。○被炸毀者，計有大型機一架，小型機十架，共計十三架。是役日機亦有一架被渝方擊中要害，惟仍能克服困難，飛返基地。</p>
<h3>日軍攻佔泗綸</h3>
<p>日軍前綫一日中央社電日軍二十三日由羅定繼續猛烈進攻，二十七日下午，攻擊渝軍第三十五集團軍司令部，遁入泗綸，排除渝第百五十八師之一部，及泗綸國民兵團之抵抗，同一時廿分將之完全佔領，刻正西進中。他方廣平之日軍，另一有力部隊，於二十七日下午七時突入梧州西南五十公里之回龍，刻正追擊渝軍，向廣西省內地進攻中。他方沿西江南岸前進中之日軍部隊，攻陷鬰南後，突破廣東省境，二十八日已前進至梧州西南十五公里。</p>
<h3>東綫戰事發展威脅巴爾幹</h3>
<p>蘇軍猛攻洪國東南部　　柏林一日中央社電海通社訊：反軸心軍在東綫及西綫之活動，均着重兩翼，中部則較爲沉寂。西綫之兩翼，在荷蘭區域及布根台區域，反軸心軍企圖在北面進入德西北部工業區，在南面侵入德南部。東綫之兩翼與政治發生聯繫，北面與芬蘭政局有關，南面與羅保兩國有關，廣大之地域落入蘇軍手中。蘇軍在波羅的海區域，以控制波羅的海之舊夢爲推動力，羅保兩國不戰而落入蘇軍手中，但蘇軍向薩諾克·克羅斯諾·契羅區域進攻，遭德洪聯軍堅強抵抗。蘇軍在羅洪邊境鐵門等處，亦猛烈進攻，蘇軍在鐵門方面進攻，殆欲避免正面山區之進攻。蘇軍進攻洪國東南部，向齊傑特·（Szeged）格拉（Gyula）及格羅斯華頓(Grosswardein）展開扇形攻勢，德洪聯軍進行流動戰頗爲得手，齊克勒（Szekler）業已放棄，蘇軍與羅軍在格羅斯華頓與克勞森（Klausen）間各山隘取得聯絡。</p>
<h3>第四戰綫將成事實</h3>
<p>蘇軍在紐克瑪(Neumark）以南作戰，蘇軍企圖切斷希腦與受琴海區域之德軍，囊括整個巴爾幹。第四戰綫即巴爾幹戰綫，或將於最近期間變成事實。巴爾幹戰綫將威脅歐洲南部，並與義戰綫聯結，蘇軍顯欲在以通過塞爾維亞區域之直綫，切斷巴爾幹與歐洲之聯繫。</p>
<h3>德海軍陸軍會師鐵門</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　海通社訊：德船一大隊，包括曳船渡船小掃雷船及河中砲艦約百隻，由薛浦少將率領，沿多瑙河戰至鐵門城，與德陸軍會師，薛少將爲加拉資船廠廠長。</p>
<h3>美生產局長納爾遜辭職</h3>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電　德國社訊，據華盛頓消息：美戰時生產局局長納爾遜，業憶辭職，遺缺已委由克魯格繼任，羅斯福總統主張納爾孫依然留任政府要職。</p>
<h3>蘇蘇間問題暴露不協調</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電海通社訊：德外交部發言人稱，艾登與邱吉爾之演說，有不同之處，邱吉爾謂要點在戰勝，而艾登則認國際政治問題困難益見增多，故艾登似較邱吉爾爲示弱，南斯拉夫問題乃此等困難之一。英方前稱，反軸心軍已在阿爾巴尼亞登陸，卒未見諸實現，蘇聯於此項報告發表後之次日，即稱蒂托已允蘇軍開入南境，而蒂托於翌日又謂所獲美國軍炎猶嫌未足，由此可見英蘇間之不協調。</p>
<h3>丹陽一瞥</h3>
<p>— 閔賢</p>
<p>記者在火車上遠眺丹陽城垣，頗饒古色古香風味，出車站以復，所接觸之車夫以及旅館接待人等，似均較京滬綫上他埠爲樸實，足爲丹陽的特色。</p>
<h3>商業與物價情形</h3>
<p>丹陽受兵變燬損，較鎭江蘇州等地爲甚，幾乎把丹陽所有的精華市街付之一炬，現在碩果僅存的中市大街，已算商業中心區域了，但規模較大之店舖仍不多見，不過五洋店亦不少，此蓋各地皆然，各小街巷擺設之五洋及毛巾等地攤，似較鎭江爲多，亦因陋就簡之辦法也。所有物價，固距鎭江甚近，除米價每石較鎭江約少一二百元外，其他一切幾與鎭江無多大出入，惟旅館設備遜於鎭江，不過房價較便宜耳。事變以前，丹陽的牛隻運銷外埠爲數頗多，固爲丹陽糯稻田不少，而牛隻即以糯稻剷下之桿爲主要食物，以是牛隻體格特別結實，並特別肥腴，但現在因爲車輛缺乏，並有許多人事困難，八月份僅運出七百餘頭，較往年差多矣，至於丹陽土產絲綢以及酒醋等商品，亦因裝運不易，尤以人事困難，營業均見衰退。</p>
<h3>農村與教育狀況</h3>
<p>丹陽大部分農村因年來收成均佳，農家有織土布機者亦不少，其一般經濟情形，尚屬良佳，因之高利貸並不多見，惟聞鄉間賭風較事變前爲甚，一擲千金無吝色者頗不乏人，似有待於當局之匡正。丹陽稻田每畝平均約收稻四石左右，聞有某數鄉村，治安不能確保，時有盜匪出沒，農民備受其殃，並受他種剝削云。丹陽教育不甚發達，學校較少，縣府雖亦有民衆教育館及公共體育塲等設備，無非應景而已，因該縣距鎭江甚近，學生多往鎭江就學。</p>
<h3>美國國內的危機</h3>
<p>人間地獄　　他們似陷在十八層深獄中的人們，愈陷愈深，他們拼命設法抑低衣食住費。且又因實際收入的減低，他們不能彌補債務的累積。軍務關係的人亦包抱在這範疇內，他們的家族，亦受生活費昂騰的影響。軍人的家族，大部份是收入所得者，與一般人同時減低生活水準。約一千五百萬的薪水階級，是依賴月俸者，沒有他，不能戰爭。第一，學校，教會，醫院，聯邦，州，市各政廳，商店，事務所，旅館，食堂，先就不能幹下去了，雜誌，報紙，書藉也不能出版了。郵件的送達，銀行兌換支票，長途電話都不能辦了。　　公務員與教員　　這些薪水階級中，有九十萬人是學校教員。他們靠平均每年一·五五○元以下的收入過活·這中間有廿五萬人以上加入軍隊，有的則改行了。據美國教育協會會長端納·笛勛博士之說，至少有百分之三十的美國兒童，受未經訓練的臨時教員們的訓導。這就是說有七百萬學童沒有受種種必要的訓育。此外有四百五十萬以上的公務員。從無名的小村以至於首都華盛頓，在各官廳工作的他們，據統計自一九四一年一月至四三年七月，平均增收十四%。羅森塞爾法院某書記這樣寫着：　　[我祗要能夠與他人一樣，願意犧牲。但我的生活支出增四○%，收入稅增四○○%，而我的收一%也不增。可是我隣舍十九歲的姑娘，初次做事就比我拿得多，每月二百五十元。]　　受學校教育的人們，大多吃完了他們的貯金，借債購買生活必需品。他們中間有圖書館員，法律家，社會事業家，建築家，大學教授，科學者等。但據美國科學關係勞働者協會的報告，[大多數科學者每週的收入爲三十五元至五十元。]牧師十三萬六千人，其大部分不能過最低以上的生活。　　負荷過重的戰爭負擔的大多數人們，爲寫字間職員，批發及另售商，及行販。美國商工會議所去年調查美國二十一都市三百五十一家公司的雇用者三萬五千六百人的平均週給，辦公文的書記二十二元，速記者三十元，電氣匠二十五元，機匠二十五元，打字員二十三元。以上是待遇頗優的大公司職員。小公司的薪給更少。美國女子在許多都市中週薪三十元以下不能生活。紐約百貨商店店員的平均俸給每週二十三元。俸給與[實際收入]的差額太大了，某事務員這樣說：　　[我領了薪俸後，二十%完稅，十%購戰時債劵，一%爲團體保險，五%爲公司的退職金，合計須扣去三六%。而妻與我的衣食至少須三○%，此外還得購買戰時債劵。我又未會加薪，而工廠勞働者則已加薪二三次，一切都扣去了以後，比過去生活苦得多了。]　　爲改善起見，規定低收入階級增薪十五%。但有些政治家說，這樣一來，要造成惡性通貨膨脹，但通貸膨脹到底沒有因此造成。每週二十五元的書記決不會浪費。無限制的浪費者招致通貨膨脹。可以無限制消費的幾千實業家，他們着高價洋服，消費莫大金錢飲食。他們所使用的錢，大部分是政府由契約所規定而支付者，在國內無謂浪費，成爲通貸膨脹的原因。（完）（翔：譯自九月二日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>舊工部局華童學校之教育性格</h3>
<p>— 上野太忠</p>
<p>○書記職務的煩重　　書記抄寫中英文外，兼理學校一切會計庶務事宜。他們對內幾負全校事務上的責任。可是決沒有普通學校事務主任或總務主任那種地位。至於待遇，則雖最高級的一等書記，還抵不上一個二三等的教師，實可謂職責不稱。而這些書記中，卻儘有辦事能力極強，或英文根基極好的人才。　　○學費的低廉　　工部局立各學校之學費，事變前略相當於市立學校。事變後，則較任何學校爲低廉。因爲學校的經費，僅一小部分取之於學費。民國三十二年春季時，中學僅收費一百數十元，小學不過三十餘元。雖係戔戔之數，還有下列的規定，即：　　一，學費並不各校一律，事變前，會有詳細調查各校學生家長每月收入之舉，並製有統計。凡平均該校學生家境清苦者，則學費較廉，反之則較昂。大抵處於工商區之學校，學費較少，住宅區之學校，學費較多。　　二，免費額的設置　　中學除由小學生中考取獎學金的學生，得享受免費待遇外，凡有弟兄兩人入學或二人以上入學者，經申請後，得享受[比例免費待遇]。家境特別清寒者，亦可援例申請。至於小學校，則規定各校學生總數之十分之一，得全免學費及書籍用品費。總數二十分之一，得半免各費，以示優待清寒子弟之意，這學費的低廉，及免費的規定，也許是招致多數學童投考華童學校理由之一。　　三，廉費學校的增設　　民國二十五年春，工部局爲求多收失學兒童起見，於工商區貧民稠密之處，（蓬路）特設半日工部制小學，所招收學生，達一千六百名之譜，學費約當其他各校五分之一。書籍用品完全免費供給，而學校設備教師質素，一切與其他全日小學無異，事變後，該校校舍雖幾經遷移，而此種廉費制度，依然保存。　　○學校對於局內　　處有密切的聯絡　　在工部局系統中，各處似均有關聯，學校自不居例外，特分術如次。　　一·與財務處的聯絡華童學校雖有充分的經費，但是學校當局，絕無流通經濟之權，除教師薪金每月由財務處支付外，每月手頭現金祗有數十元購買物件，均憑一紙定單，向各大公司商店定貨，不付現款，而由校長將發票送財務處報賬，經財務處核准後，始得由商店直接向財務處收賬，學校全不顧問。如此，則可以免去流弊。所困難者，有時欲購之必需物品，財務處不予通過，則將發生絕大問題。　　二·與衛生處的聯絡衛生處設有學校視察員及學校醫務課，前者專司視察學校環境飲水設備厠所塲地之整潔。教室人數之是否過於擁擠，以及校舍構造採光通風等情形。後者每日於一定時間，檢查學生身體狀況，惟其中值得注意者，乃醫生發現兒童患有疾病時，立即通知學校當局，予以隔離。有傳染病者，施行嚴格消毒。病孩非得醫生[准許上課證]，不得到校上課。病假不到校之兒童，亦必有看護訪問其家庭，或指導其攝養延醫及其他處理疾病之辦法。至於每年定期爲學生注射傷寒針防疫針或種痘等，尤爲餘事　　三·與工程處的聯絡學校校舍一切修理添置，均由工程處負責辦理。對於校舍的保持，塲地的經營，以及一般校舍設備的處置，工程處常派員視擦，予以協助或注意。此外學校一切經常工程上之維持，如屋漏門窗破，地板裂墻壁毀，桌椅壞等，祗須開具一紙修添請求單，工程處便立刻飭工修理，其費用就學校規定預算，由財務處轉賬支付。　　四·與火政處的聯絡火政處隨時派員來校指導員工學生施用防火設備，及講授各種防火辦法，同時每年在適當時期，必將各項防火設備嚴加校騐　　○設備的特徵　　華童學校，在事變的前後，設備上有顯著的不同。約有半數的學校，不能回到原校校舍去，而不得不租賃臨時校舍上課。至於校具及一切設備，也多受損失，雖有一部分學校，竭力維持原有設備，但瘡痍之後，畢竟難復舊觀。茲僅述一般學校之設備情形如下：　　○校舍　　華童學校校舍，有由上海中西紳商耆宿捐贈校基或經費，由工部局籌建校舍者，（如華童公學，聶中丞公學，格致公學）有將自建之校舍，獻諸工部局（育才公學）者。其他校舍，大部由工部局獨力經營建築，或出資購買，作爲局產。因當時經費充足，設計優良，故校舍大部美奐美輪，雄踞滬上。尤以女子中學，新閘路小學，荊州路小學，建築經費各達二三十萬元之譜。若以當時物價與目前相比，則僅一校之校舍，所需即在萬萬元以上。工程之偉大，建築之堅固，自不待言，會見事變時荊州路小學，會中巨砲砲彈，玻璃全被震碎，而校舍僅洞一孔，矻然無其他損失　　○基地之寬大　　上海寸土千金之地，而華童學校，大都擁有寬大之基地，平均總在十畝以上，且多廣植樹木，平鋪草地，操塲校園，景趣幽然。在車廣馬足之都市中心，別有天地，實可稱爲環境優良之學府。　　○校舍之一般設備　　較新建之校舍內，大都有寬大宏敞可容全校學童之大禮堂，健身房。至於影戲間，理化室，自然室，木工室，音樂室等，殆無所不備。厠所之整潔，尤堪注意。此外適合兒童身材之課桌椅，（小學會由華人教育處設計定製，高中低級課桌椅千餘套，輕便堅固，桌椅分開，可以自由移動）。不反光的轉動黑板，無礙視覺的彈簧窗簾，可供多人飲用的清潔沙濾水，防止學童出入擁擠擊撞危險的門停……等等，都是特殊的設備。惟以上各種設備，均須隨時由工程處視察裝修，以維持其效率。否則一經損壞，不僅修理困難，抑且有礙學校管理。　　○圖書館的設備　　圖書一項，各校極不完備。每年僅有少數圖書館費，僅能維持消耗，不足以言添置新書。即有若千書籍。亦不過供少數人閱覽範圍狹窄之書類。一切未可稱道。因此多數學校，不得不採用流通圖書館辦法，或互相輪流借閱，以補不足。</p>

<h3>Outlook on the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>Q: The war situation in the Pacific has recently become increasingly intense. The United States is using its naval mobile forces to attack small islands in the Pacific at any cost. May I ask why the United States is taking such a risky action?</p>
<p>A: The United States has always been a liberal country. Since joining the war, it has gradually moved towards a wartime system domestically. In the early stages of the war, the atmosphere of war was strong, but as the war prolonged, the impact of the war on the country gradually became apparent. After several years of war, the people have a strong tendency to oppose the war. Therefore, the new operations of the US military in the Pacific can be described as a shot in the arm for the people at home. This is the first reason. This year, the United States is holding presidential elections, and Roosevelt has broken precedent to compete for a fourth term. Not only is the Republican Dewey a strong opponent, but there are also groups within the Democratic Party that oppose Roosevelt. Therefore, the future of the fourth election is full of hidden reefs. The biggest reason for launching the [new offensive] in the Pacific this time is to benefit his fourth election. This is the second reason. Therefore, the United States is taking a risky action at a huge sacrifice.</p>
<p>Q: So, is this kind of adventurous move by the United States beneficial to the future of the US war effort?</p>
<p>A: Although the United States landed on Peleliu Island in the southeast of the Philippines, and a small part of the landing was successful, it still cannot help the war situation. Now the largest naval and air base for the United States in the Pacific is of course the Hawaiian Islands. Now that Hawaii is more than 4,000 nautical miles away from Peleliu Island, its naval supply line has become an extremely serious problem. Now, assuming that the United States has a division of troops, it will take at least 300,000 tons of ships to supply this division with weapons and materials. According to military common sense, the ratio between offense and defense is three to one. Then, assuming that the Japanese army has a force of 100 divisions, the US military must have at least 300 divisions if it wants to fight a decisive battle with the Japanese army. At this time, the required ship transportation will increase to as much as 90 million tons. Although the United States is a country rich in resources, it is a huge question whether it has the ability to supply such a huge fleet. Therefore, the longer the naval front is extended, the more unfavorable it is for the United States.</p>
<p>Q: At present, the strategic trend of the United States in the Pacific seems to be divided into three aspects: first, attacking the Philippines to cut off the connection between Japan and the South Sea Islands; second, attacking the Ogasawara Islands to try to spy on the Japanese mainland; and third, implementing air strike tactics in an attempt to consume Japan's production capacity. I wonder what your opinion is?</p>
<p>A: Regarding the first point, I have just said that the longer the US front is, the more unfavorable the future will be. For example, although the United States has an absolute advantage in troops when it occupies the two islands of Saipan and Tinian, it still takes more than 60 days of fierce fighting to succeed; the difficulties of future operations in such a vast archipelago of the Philippines can be imagined. Regarding the second strategy, it contains endless dangers. The closer the US Navy fleet gets to the Japanese mainland, the closer it is to the Japanese aviation circle, which means more opportunities for the US fleet to be completely destroyed. The mode of naval warfare is absolutely different from land warfare. The main body of the navy is the fleet, and the gains and losses of the fleet can determine the entire war situation. During the Russo-Japanese War, no one expected that Imperial Russia would be defeated, but the complete annihilation of the Baltic Fleet in the Tsushima Strait was the fatal wound of the entire Imperial Russia and the biggest key to Japan's victory. Now, if the United States wants to attack the Ogasawara Islands, or even try to spy on the Japanese mainland, it must send a powerful naval mobile force to cruise in the waters near Japan, which is an excellent opportunity for Japan to destroy the enemy. In addition, when the US fleet sails close to the Japanese mainland, it enters Japan's powerful aviation circle. No matter in terms of quantity, quality, aviation speed, time, or distance, it is absolutely beneficial to Japan. May I ask how to confront the planes inside the Japanese mainland by relying solely on aircraft carriers or a few planes on the Chinese mainland? If the US fleet loses air supremacy, the navy is powerless. The day when the US fleet is completely destroyed will be the day when Japan wins.</p>
<p>Q: Then, what if the United States uses air strike tactics to bomb the Japanese mainland?</p>
<p>A: Even if the United States can bomb the Japanese mainland, this bombing method is by no means comparable to the large-scale bombing of Berlin and Hamburg by Britain and the United States. First, the British mainland is only one hour away from Germany; second, Britain and the United States have a strong air force and strong bases in Britain, so bombing Germany is not very difficult. However, if the United States wants to carry out air strike tactics against Japan, may I ask where the United States will get a large number of planes? Where will it get a strong base? And where will it get the spare time? As a result, if the United States uses air strikes as part of guerrilla warfare, it is possible, but if it wants to bomb Japan on a large scale, it is absolutely impossible in reality.</p>
<p>Q: In this case, it is unfavorable for the United States to attack the Philippines, and it is absolutely dangerous to try to spy on the Japanese mainland. It is impossible to succeed in implementing air strike tactics. As a result, Japan is in control of the initiative of the war, and the future is of course unfavorable to the United States.</p>
<p>A: That's right. The current trend of the war is unfavorable to the United States. This is not only our opinion, but the US authorities have to admit the difficulty of the future of the war. Not only is the future of the war beneficial to Japan, but Japan's domestic wartime system is also becoming increasingly sound. The complete militarization of enterprises, the general mobilization of the people, and the establishment of an air defense posture are all sufficient to prove the increasing strengthening of the domestic wartime system. In addition, since the establishment of the Koiso Cabinet, Japan has been united from top to bottom, and the people are united. In terms of both material and spirit, it has indeed moved towards the path of certain victory. The clarification of the Pacific war situation is not far away.</p>
<h3>Enemy Air Force Attacking Pacific Islands Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>More than 170 aircraft shot down in mid-February. Central News Agency, Central Pacific Base, 1st. Twenty enemy aircraft attacked Chichijima and Hahajima in the Ogasawara Islands on the 28th, and one was shot down. More than ten enemy aircraft attacked Truk Island in the afternoon, and three were shot down. Twenty enemy aircraft attacked Koror Island in the Palau Islands, and several enemy aircraft attacked Minami-Tori Shima on the 29th, and one was shot down. Central News Agency, Southwest Pacific Base, 1st. The Japanese garrison in the Halmahera area countered the attacking enemy aircraft, and the battle became increasingly fierce. The comprehensive results of countering the enemy aircraft from July 27 to September 25 are as follows: ○ 37 B24 aircraft, 13 B25 aircraft, 2 P38 aircraft, 4 P47 aircraft, and 30 F4F aircraft were shot down, for a total of 86 aircraft. ○ 67 B24 aircraft, 2 B25 aircraft, 5 P38 aircraft, 2 P47 aircraft, and 6 F4F aircraft were destroyed, for a total of more than 82 aircraft, for a total of 168 enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Fight Fiercely on Peleliu and Other Islands</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st, Central News Agency, the following is a separate report on the recent war situation of the Japanese army in the south: ○ In the Peleliu Island area, after a part of the enemy troops landed on the northern end of Peleliu Island and Gritbus Island on the 26th, the Japanese garrison on the island immediately countered them, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. However, the enemy continued to bombard the island with artillery fire for days, which was extremely fierce. On the 26th, when the enemy was in chaos due to the bombing of the Japanese aircraft fleet, the Japanese garrison on Peleliu Island launched a bayonet attack, daring to charge and kill, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, which deeply shocked the enemy camp. On the 27th, another attack was launched, and great results were achieved, but the details are still unclear. However, judging from the results of the battle of a part of the advance team alone, two mortars, two heavy machine guns, and one heavy machine gun for destruction were captured, and many enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. On the same day, a fierce artillery bombardment was carried out on the Suifu Mountain observation mountain, but the superior enemy still attacked Suifu Mountain, and all of them were completely defeated after suffering heavy damage. In addition, the enemy invaded the northern area of the mountain with 20 tanks and 4 field guns. The Japanese garrison immediately countered them, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. However, as of the 20th, many enemy tanks on the island have been destroyed (4 were destroyed on the 18th and 5 were destroyed on the 19th). On the 27th, the enemy air force on Angaur Island, Peleliu Island, also attacked Palau Island and Koromi with 90 aircraft, but after being countered by the Japanese garrison, 2 aircraft were shot down and 6 were severely damaged. The Japanese army in the Angaur Island area is still guarding the key points of the highlands in the northwest of the island, and is engaged in fierce battles with the enemy. On the Morotai side, the Japanese army continued to launch bayonet charges, which deeply shocked the enemy camp. At the same time, the Japanese aircraft fleet responded to the land troops and bombed the area near the enemy landing point day and night, destroying one medium-sized enemy transport ship and achieving considerable results. On the evening of the 26th, at dawn on the 27th, and on the night of the 27th, continuous bombardments were carried out near the enemy landing point, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.</p>
<h3>Mr. Nagao Talks About the War Situation, Holding a Belief in Certain Victory</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai. Mr. Iwao Nagao, the Shanghai branch manager of Nippon Yusen, has repeatedly inspected various parts of the Central Pacific. He recently heard that the entire Japanese military and civilians on Saipan Island and Tinian Island had died heroically. The Imperial Headquarters announced on the 30th, and he expressed his views on the future trend of the war situation as follows: [I have always been very close to the people in the garrison forces on Saipan and Tinian Islands. Now I am overwhelmed with regret to hear the news of the heroic sacrifice of the entire army, but this will never shake Japan's decisive battle posture. In the past battle of Saipan, although we cannot ignore the enemy's superiority in local operations, we must not confuse the trend of the battle with the trend of the war situation. This time, the enemy US is stubbornly holding on to its superior material strength to attack, but due to the extension of the supply line and the difficulty of replenishing food and ammunition, the number of sacrifices is increasing day by day. According to the investigation, the US military lost an average of 56 people per square kilometer in the battle of Saipan, and the losses suffered today on Peleliu Island have increased sharply to 412 people. The US military's continued attacks at the cost of heavy sacrifices are purely a concrete manifestation of Roosevelt's arrogant ambition to achieve a fourth term as president. In particular, Saipan Island was originally Guam, which belonged to the United States, so [recovering lost territory] is the most effective propaganda tool. However, the US military used dozens of times the troops and a large number of warships and aircraft to conquer this small island, which took as long as 70 days. How can it attack Japan, which is far away and has strong defenses? The United States will not find it difficult to understand the many difficulties. On the other hand, the enemy US's wishful thinking of operating on the Chinese mainland has also been completely shattered because the Japanese army took the lead and achieved unprecedented success in Hunan. Therefore, in order to recover the situation, Roosevelt attempted to recapture Saipan Island and Tinian Island as exaggerated and obfuscating propaganda. On the other hand, he still did not give up the hope of attacking Japan. In short, since the establishment of the Koiso Cabinet, the establishment of the War Guidance Council has actively promoted the increase in aircraft production, and remarkable achievements have been made in all aspects. The whole country has a firm belief in the final victory. At this important stage of the war, we must rise up together to destroy the arrogant enemy, so as to comfort the heroic spirits. We will see that the United States' anxiety will become deeper and deeper with the intensification of the war against Japan, and Japan's belief in certain victory will become more and more firm.]</p>
<h3>Military and Civilians on Both Islands Sacrificing Their Lives Shows the Traditional Japanese Spirit</h3>
<p>President Ogata's Speech. Tokyo, 1st, Central News Agency. Mr. Ogata, President of the Japanese Information Bureau, gave a speech on the 30th, the gist of which is: Regarding the news of the Japanese residents on Saipan Island and Tinian Island, the Imperial Headquarters has made an announcement. Now, I will summarize the telegrams from the local area and briefly describe the . The Japanese residents on the two islands worked together with the Japanese army to defend the islands. When the enemy army began to attack in July, regardless of age, all those who could fight cooperated with the Japanese army to attack the superior enemy army and engaged in fierce battles. There were about 15,000 Japanese residents on Tinian Island, of which about 3,500 young men aged 16 to 45 formed several teams of volunteer soldiers, worked closely with the soldiers, insisted on assisting in the war, and died heroically in battle. As for the old, weak, women and children, they gathered in the Carolinas area of the island to avoid the war and assisted the Japanese army in the war. When the enemy army approached and reached the rear defense line, they were unwilling to be humiliated by the enemy and all committed suicide. There were about 500 Japanese residents on Saipan Island, and they cooperated with the army to fight against the strong enemy in the same way as on Tinian Island. All the officers and men had the indomitable spirit of guarding the imperial land. Therefore, it fully showed our determination to kill the archenemy and fulfill the unfulfilled ambition of the martyred generals.</p>
<h3>War Results of the Japanese Army in Shanxi Province in September</h3>
<p>Taiyuan, 1st, Central News Agency. In the punitive war in mid-September, the Japanese army in Shanxi Province collected 991 corpses of the Chongqing army, captured 255 people, seized 246 pistols, 144 landmines, 81 hand grenades, 16 light machine guns, 3 mortars, and 53 foreign guns. Destroyed 1 defense bureau, 2 barracks, 4 clothing depots, 3 cooperatives, 3 food depots, 3 material supply stations, 3 bunkers, 1 clothing factory, 1 weapon repair factory, and 1 district office of the Chongqing army.</p>
<h3>Japanese Bomber Fleet Attacks Liuzhou and Nanning</h3>
<p>36 Chongqing aircraft destroyed. A certain base of the Japanese army on the Chinese mainland, 1st, Central News Agency. The Japanese bomber fleet attacked Liuzhou again with its main force on the 29th, and another team raided Nanning, destroying a total of 36 Chongqing aircraft and setting up two locations. The details are recorded as follows: ○ The leading Japanese aircraft in the attack on Liuzhou used moonlight to conduct a brief reconnaissance, and immediately bombed the covered trenches in the southeast corner of the taxiway, hitting two aircraft with four engines in the trenches and causing them to catch fire. The Japanese aircraft then concentrated their bombing on this flame as the target. A total of 13 Chongqing aircraft were damaged in this battle, including 5 Chongqing large aircraft, 2 with four engines, 3 small aircraft, and 2 facilities (1 was a fuel depot and 1 seemed to be an aircraft hangar). Destroyed 2 large aircraft and 3 small aircraft. ○ Another team of Japanese aircraft, while flying to raid Nanning, eliminated the interference of the US fighter aircraft stationed in Chongqing and the shooting of the Chongqing anti-aircraft artillery fire, and bombed the aircraft parking area, and immediately achieved the following results: ○ The Chongqing aircraft that were destroyed and burned due to the attack included 4 large aircraft with four engines. ○ The aircraft that were destroyed included 1 large aircraft and 10 small aircraft, for a total of 13 aircraft. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft was also hit in a vital area by the Chongqing side, but it was still able to overcome the difficulties and fly back to the base.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Occupies Silong</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Frontline, 1st, Central News Agency. The Japanese army continued to attack fiercely from Luoding on the 23rd. On the afternoon of the 27th, it attacked the headquarters of the 35th Army Group of the Chongqing army, which escaped into Silong, and eliminated the resistance of a part of the 158th Division of Chongqing and the Silong National Corps. It was completely occupied at 20 minutes at the same time, and it is currently advancing westward. On the other hand, another powerful force of the Japanese army in Guangping broke into Huilong, 50 kilometers southwest of Wuzhou, at 7 pm on the 27th, and is currently pursuing the Chongqing army and attacking the interior of Guangxi Province. On the other hand, the Japanese army unit advancing along the south bank of the West River occupied Yulin and broke through the border of Guangdong Province, and had advanced to 15 kilometers southwest of Wuzhou on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Development of the Eastern Front Threatens the Balkans</h3>
<p>Soviet Army Fiercely Attacks Southeastern Hungary. Berlin, 1st, Central News Agency. Havas reported: The activities of the anti-Axis forces on the Eastern Front and the Western Front are focused on the flanks, while the center is relatively calm. On the flanks of the Western Front, in the Netherlands area and the Burgundy area, the anti-Axis forces are attempting to enter the northwestern industrial area of Germany in the north and invade southern Germany in the south. The flanks of the Eastern Front are related to politics. The north is related to the Finnish political situation, and the south is related to the situation in Romania and Bulgaria. A vast area has fallen into the hands of the Soviet army. In the Baltic Sea area, the Soviet army is driven by the old dream of controlling the Baltic Sea. Romania and Bulgaria fell into the hands of the Soviet army without a fight, but the Soviet army was met with strong resistance from the German-Hungarian coalition forces when it attacked the Sanok, Krosno, and Czło areas. The Soviet army is also fiercely attacking at the Iron Gate and other places on the Romanian-Hungarian border. The Soviet army's attack on the Iron Gate is probably to avoid attacking the mountainous areas head-on. The Soviet army attacked southeastern Hungary, launching a fan-shaped offensive towards Szeged, Gyula, and Grosswardein. The German-Hungarian coalition forces are conducting mobile warfare successfully. Szekler has been abandoned, and the Soviet army and the Romanian army have established contact in various mountain passes between Grosswardein and Klausen.</p>
<h3>Fourth Front Will Become a Reality</h3>
<p>The Soviet army is operating south of Neumark, and the Soviet army is attempting to cut off the German army in the Hiiu and Saaremaa areas and encompass the entire Balkans. The Fourth Front, the Balkan Front, may become a reality in the near future. The Balkan Front will threaten southern Europe and connect with the Italian Front. The Soviet army is clearly attempting to cut off the connection between the Balkans and Europe in a straight line through the Serbian area.</p>
<h3>German Navy and Army Meet at the Iron Gate</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st, Central News Agency. Havas reported: A large German fleet, including about 100 tugboats, ferries, small minesweepers, and river gunboats, led by Major General Scherf, fought along the Danube River to the Iron Gate City and met with the German army. Major General Scherf is the director of the Galaţi Shipyard.</p>
<h3>US Production Bureau Director Nelson Resigns</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency. According to a German agency report from Washington: Nelson, the director of the US Wartime Production Bureau, has resigned, and his vacancy has been filled by Krug. President Roosevelt advocates that Nelson should still hold an important position in the government.</p>
<h3>Inconsistencies Exposed in Soviet-Soviet Issues</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st, Central News Agency. Havas reported: The spokesman of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that there were differences between Eden's and Churchill's speeches. Churchill said that the key point was to win the war, while Eden believed that international political problems were becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, Eden seemed to be weaker than Churchill, and the Yugoslav issue was one of these difficulties. The British side previously stated that the anti-Axis forces had landed in Albania, but this was not realized in the end. The Soviet Union stated the day after this report was released that Tito had allowed the Soviet army to enter southern Yugoslavia, and Tito said the next day that the US military aid he had received was still not enough. From this, it can be seen that there is inconsistency between Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Danyang</h3>
<p>— Min Xian</p>
<p>The reporter looked at the city wall of Danyang from afar on the train, which was quite ancient and fragrant. After getting out of the station, the rickshaw pullers and hotel receptionists seemed to be more simple and honest than those in other cities on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, which is a characteristic of Danyang.</p>
<h3>Commercial and Price Situation</h3>
<p>Danyang was more severely damaged by the mutiny than Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and other places. Almost all the essence of Danyang's streets was reduced to ashes. The Zhongshi Street, which is now the only remaining street, is already considered the commercial center area, but there are still not many large-scale shops. However, there are many Wu Yang stores, which is true everywhere. There seem to be more Wu Yang and towel stalls in the small streets and alleys than in Zhenjiang, which is also a simple way. All the prices are very close to Zhenjiang. Except that the price of rice is about 100 to 200 yuan less per stone than in Zhenjiang, everything else is almost the same as in Zhenjiang. However, the hotel facilities are inferior to Zhenjiang, but the room rates are cheaper. Before the mutiny, Danyang's cattle were sold to other places in large numbers. This is because Danyang has many glutinous rice fields, and cattle mainly feed on the stalks left over from glutinous rice, so the cattle are particularly strong and fat. However, now, due to the lack of vehicles and many personnel difficulties, only more than 700 heads were shipped out in August, which is much worse than in previous years. As for Danyang's local silk and wine vinegar products, they are also declining due to the difficulty of loading and transporting, especially the personnel difficulties.</p>
<h3>Rural and Educational Conditions</h3>
<p>Most of the rural areas in Danyang have good harvests in recent years, and many farmers have earth cloth weaving machines. Their general economic situation is still good, so high interest loans are not common. However, it is heard that the gambling style in the countryside is worse than before the mutiny, and there are quite a few people who are willing to spend a lot of money, which seems to need to be corrected by the authorities. Danyang's rice fields yield an average of about 4 stone of rice per mu. It is heard that the security in some villages cannot be guaranteed, and bandits often appear, and the farmers are suffering from it and are subjected to other kinds of exploitation. Education in Danyang is not very developed, and there are fewer schools. Although the county government also has facilities such as a mass education center and a public sports field, they are only for show. Because the county is very close to Zhenjiang, many students go to school in Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3>The Crisis Within the United States</h3>
<p>A Living Hell: They are like people trapped in the deepest depths of the eighteenth level of hell, sinking deeper and deeper. They are desperately trying to reduce their expenses on clothing, food, and housing. Moreover, due to the decrease in actual income, they cannot make up for the accumulation of debt. Those involved in military affairs are also included in this category. Their families are also affected by the soaring cost of living. Most military families rely on their income, and like ordinary people, they are forced to reduce their standard of living. Approximately 15 million salaried workers rely on their monthly income; without them, there can be no war. Firstly, schools, churches, hospitals, federal, state, and municipal governments, stores, offices, hotels, and restaurants would be unable to function. Magazines, newspapers, and books could not be published. Mail delivery, bank check cashing, and long-distance telephone calls would all be impossible.</p>
<p>Civil Servants and Teachers: Among these salaried workers, 900,000 are school teachers. They live on an average annual income of less than $1,550. More than 250,000 of them have joined the military, while others have changed careers. According to Dr. Duana Deshun, president of the American Education Association, at least 30% of American children are being taught by untrained temporary teachers. This means that 7 million students are not receiving the necessary education. In addition, there are more than 4.5 million civil servants. Working in government offices from nameless villages to the capital, Washington, D.C., their average income has increased by 14% from January 1941 to July 1943, according to statistics. A clerk in the Rosenthal Court wrote:</p>
<p>[I am willing to sacrifice, as others are. However, my living expenses have increased by 40%, my income tax has increased by 400%, and my income has not increased by even 1%. But my nineteen-year-old neighbor girl earns more than I do in her first job, $250 a month.]</p>
<p>Most educated people have exhausted their savings and borrowed money to buy necessities. Among them are librarians, lawyers, social workers, architects, university professors, and scientists. However, according to a report from the American Association of Scientific Workers, [most scientists earn between $35 and $50 a week.] Of the 136,000 pastors, most cannot afford even a minimum standard of living.</p>
<p>The majority of people burdened by the heavy war burden are office workers, wholesalers, retailers, and peddlers. The American Chamber of Commerce surveyed 35,600 employees in 351 companies in 21 American cities last year and found that the average weekly wage was $22 for office clerks, $30 for stenographers, $25 for electricians, $25 for mechanics, and $23 for typists. These are the employees of relatively well-paid large companies. Small companies pay even less. In many cities, American women cannot live on less than $30 a week. The average salary for department store clerks in New York is $23 per week. The difference between salary and [actual income] is too great, as one office worker said:</p>
<p>[After receiving my salary, 20% goes to taxes, 10% to war bonds, 1% to group insurance, and 5% to the company's retirement fund, totaling 36%. At least 30% is needed for my wife and my food and clothing, and I still have to buy war bonds. I haven't had a raise, but factory workers have had two or three raises. After everything is deducted, life is much harder than it used to be.]</p>
<p>To improve the situation, a 15% wage increase was stipulated for the low-income class. However, some politicians said that this would create malignant inflation, but inflation did not occur as a result. A clerk earning $25 a week would never waste money. Unrestricted spenders cause inflation. The thousands of industrialists who can spend without restriction wear expensive foreign suits and spend huge amounts of money on food and drink. Most of the money they use is paid by the government under contract, which is wasted domestically and causes inflation. (End) (翔: Translated from the September 2nd issue of Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Strengthening Surveillance and Establishing Air Defense Watchtowers: Police Defense Department Formulates Various Establishment Rules</h3>
<p>The Police Defense Department of this city's Police Bureau, recognizing the paramount importance of aerial surveillance in air defense matters, a task previously undertaken solely by the military, now deems it inappropriate given the recent situation. Hence, it is imperative for both officials and civilians to promptly prepare and enhance surveillance efforts. Therefore, each branch bureau is directed to expedite the establishment of air defense watchtowers in accordance with the attached provisional guidelines. This is to achieve the purpose of monitoring and preventing various disruptive acts from continuously occurring, while also serving as a precursor to local air defense work. The relevant agencies must submit reports on the location and other essential details of the established facilities within the day to ensure flawless operation in the future.</p>
<h3>Establishment Guidelines</h3>
<p>(A) Purpose of Establishing Watchtowers: Watchtowers serve as the eyes and ears of citizens for air defense. They monitor the lighting control situation within their respective areas, quickly detect and identify approaching aircraft, and promptly report their movements and the resulting damage to the Air Defense Headquarters, enabling appropriate air defense countermeasures. Additionally, they monitor ground defense strategies and communication activities, ensuring the smooth implementation of all air defense measures.</p>
<p>(B) Establishment Requirements: Air defense watchtowers are divided into the following two types: ○ Special Air Defense Watchtowers. Each General Joint Protection Area should have one specially established air defense watchtower, located at the most suitable point within the area for observation and communication, and directly commanded by the head of the responsible police branch bureau. ○ Protection and Defense Watchtowers. In principle, protection and defense watchtowers should be staffed by personnel from the baojia self-defense corps. One watchtower should be established per bao as a standard. However, when special air defense needs arise, one bao can be divided into several units, or several baos can be combined into one unit, to establish a corresponding number of watchtowers. ○ The location of the watchtower should be selected based on aerial and terrestrial observation and communication considerations, and should be located on the most suitable high-rise building. ○ Air defense watchtower personnel should be on duty during alert periods. ○ The number of watchtower personnel should be determined as needed (approximately four to ten people). Selected personnel should be physically strong, have good eyesight and hearing, be able to comprehensively assess local conditions, and be resolute, calm, and well-educated to be able to fulfill their surveillance duties. ○ Each watchtower should have one watchtower chief responsible for overall command and control. ○ Watchtower personnel should adopt a shift system with appropriate hours and be instructed to provide diligent and constant service. ○ Each watchtower should use the funds of the local baojia to establish defense facilities (against shrapnel and the shock of our own anti-aircraft shells, etc.) and complete lighting control equipment. ○ The results of surveillance should be communicated to the police branch bureau as soon as possible and accurately reported. The police branch bureau should implement various countermeasures based on the reports and as the situation warrants. ○ The police branch bureau should assess the reports from each watchtower and report necessary matters to the Air Defense Section of Headquarters at any time.</p>
<h3>Important Matters</h3>
<p>The watchtower post should be equipped with an accurate map, a direction finder, and important communication items. ○ The time of enemy aircraft detection should be recorded using a 24-hour system, without distinguishing between a.m. and p.m., and the clock should be accurately set. ○ The direction of enemy aircraft detection should be distinguished by the eight directions of east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, north, and northeast, and should be noted with landmarks such as buildings, roads, and other features for reference. ○ Identify enemy or friendly aircraft, or aircraft of unknown origin. ○ Identify the type of aircraft (large, medium, or small). ○ Note the number of aircraft. ○ Note the altitude. ○ Note the direction of flight. ○ Note the wind direction. ○ Note the damage caused by the attack.</p>
<p>To avoid cumbersome and repetitive reports from each bao watchtower, the police branch bureau will designate the most suitable bao watchtowers, approximately one in each joint protection area, as Class A Protection Air Defense Watchtowers to be responsible for the aforementioned reporting tasks. Other watchtowers will communicate exclusively with the baos in their respective areas to maximize their functionality (referred to as Class B Protection Air Defense Watchtowers).</p>
<p>(C) Establishment Scope: ○ Watchtowers should be established urgently in the area under the jurisdiction of the former First Police Bureau in the city center. ○ The branch bureaus of the former Second Police Bureau in the city center should establish watchtowers as soon as possible within their capabilities. ○ Police branch bureaus in the suburbs should establish watchtowers within their capabilities in accordance with the provisions of these provisional guidelines. ○ The date for implementation in the Navy baojia area will be determined separately.</p>
<h3>Commodity Distribution Office Revises Bread Ration Prices</h3>
<p>Retail Price: 57 Yuan per Pound</p>
<p>The City Commodity Distribution Office, due to the adjustment of the rationed flour price by the Flour and Wheat Committee from yesterday (1st), and the changes in the price of leavening powder sold on the market, has revised the retail and wholesale prices of bread at the request of the bread manufacturers. The announcement is as follows:</p>
<p>From October 1st until further notice, the wholesale price of plain white bread manufactured by registered bakeries in the city is revised to 50 yuan national currency per pound, and the retail price is revised to 57 yuan per pound (the price for less than or more than one pound is calculated proportionally). Packaging will incur additional packaging fees. Furthermore, the rationed flour received by each registered bakery is limited to the production of five types of price-controlled bread weighing 8 liang, 12 liang, 16 liang, 24 liang, and 32 liang. From the same date, the ration amount of No. 1 flour for bread coupon holders is also limited to one jin per coupon, costing 50 yuan national currency (without packaging).</p>
<h3>Unregistered Industrial and Commercial Enterprises Will Be Punished</h3>
<p>The City Economic Bureau, in order to understand the operational status of factories and various commercial enterprises throughout the city, has been conducting industrial and commercial registrations, which have been repeatedly extended. It is now learned that the process officially concluded at the end of last month. It is also reported that the Bureau will dispatch personnel from the Economic Security Office to conduct investigations. Any factories or newly established businesses found to be unregistered in accordance with the law will be severely punished. According to regulations, all registered factories must apply for registration within three months after the implementation of these measures. Those who fail to register within the deadline, even after being notified by the Economic Bureau, will be punished in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 2 of the Administrative Execution Law, and may also be subject to a suspension of business for three to seven days. The same applies to newly established factories that fail to apply for registration within two months.</p>
<p>Any newly established commercial enterprises that fail to register, and commercial enterprises that have been given a deadline by the Economic Bureau to register but fail to do so within the deadline, will be fined between 100 and 1,000 yuan and may be subject to a suspension of business for three to seven days.</p>
<h3>Streetcars and Buses Sell Tickets at New Prices</h3>
<p>Streetcars and buses in this city have been selling tickets at the newly revised prices since yesterday, with increases of 1.5 to 2 times the original prices.</p>
<h3>Central Insurance Company Opens Tomorrow</h3>
<p>To expand its insurance business, Central Trust Co., Ltd. will separate its insurance department into an independent operation and establish Central Insurance Co., Ltd. with a portion of capital allocated by the Central Reserve Bank. The capital amount is set at 10 million yuan. The opening ceremony will be held tomorrow (3rd), presided over by Chairman Zhou Fohai.</p>
<h3>Banks and Financial Institutions to Handle Loans Cautiously After the Holiday</h3>
<p>Assisting the Government in Suppressing Commodity Prices</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival's financial year-end hurdle was safely navigated, with the banking and financial industries receiving financial adjustments from the Central Reserve Bank, preventing unexpected bankruptcies. Banks, financial institutions, and securities markets in this city are taking a compensatory holiday today (1st) and will resume business as usual tomorrow (3rd). According to a Central News Agency reporter, banks and financial institutions in this city, mindful of the recent potential for speculators to hoard commodities by utilizing funds, are determined to assist the government in curbing speculation and suppressing commodity prices. After resuming business following the holiday, they will handle mortgage loan applications with caution. If items related to people's livelihoods are used as collateral or if the funds are for improper purposes, loan applications will be rejected. The banks also plan to report applicants to the authorities for punishment.</p>
<h3>Weekly Market Review</h3>
<p>The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai last week showed a steady upward trend. The financial market was slightly tight due to the Mid-Autumn Festival financial year-end, with a slight increase after the shadow market stabilized. Although Chinese stocks were weak, the stock market fluctuated, with industrial stocks trending upwards. Other cultural and real estate stocks declined. The trading volume was less than usual. The industrial market faced limited electricity and raw material supplies, making it difficult to see optimism in production. Investors continued to buy up goods, leading to frequent price increases, especially for essential food items such as rice, oil, and fuel. This phenomenon has a significant impact on people's livelihoods. Therefore, the authorities have been secretly investigating business transactions and strictly punishing hoarding and speculation as a measure to suppress rising prices. Overall, the largest price increases last week reached 20%, followed by increases of around 10%.</p>
<h3>Sino-Western Music Concert Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Sino-Western Music Concert for the benefit of scholarship funds will be grandly opened at the Lyceum Theatre at 5:00 PM today.

<h3>Donghua Defeats German Merchants in Layered Wood Partition Curtain Football Match</h3>
<p>The opening match of the football season, a friendly match between Donghua and German Merchants, was held at Yiyuan at 10:00 AM yesterday. Coinciding with the Mid-Autumn Festival, the audience reached five to six thousand people, and the atmosphere along Xianyang Road was enthusiastic. The referee was Chen Jixiang. Less than three minutes after the start of the match, Li Yao made a clever pass, and Han Longhai scored with a header, taking the lead. Eight minutes later, W. Pantuson scored with a long shot, tying the score at 1-1. After a long stalemate, Han Longhai scored again. Shortly after, Li Yao pushed the ball into the empty net. At the end of the first half, Donghua led 3-1. After the change of sides, German Merchant Fu Enlili shot and broke the net, making it 2-3. After that, Donghua's momentum suddenly increased, and German Merchants was at a loss. The Donghua team rampaged through the German Merchants' formation. Sun Tieleg scored twice, Han Longhai scored three times, and Li Yao was not to be outdone, sweeping the ball into the net. Finally, A Sun scored another goal, and the match ended hastily. Donghua ultimately won 8-2, achieving a successful start. After the match, the Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory Manager presented the award and the event concluded.</p>
<p>(Another report) The first charity match organized by the City Football Association is scheduled to be held at the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse at 5:00 PM on the 4th of this month. Donghua will play against Overseas Chinese Federation. All proceeds from this event will go to the Guangdong Native Place Association to support welfare projects.</p>

<h3>The Educational Character of Former Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Schools</h3>
<p>— Ueno Taichu</p>
<p>○ The Cumbersome Nature of the Clerk's Duties: Besides copying documents in Chinese and English, the clerk also handles all accounting and general affairs of the school. Internally, they bear almost full responsibility for school affairs. However, they do not have the status of a general affairs director or head of general affairs in ordinary schools. As for compensation, even the highest-ranking first-class clerk does not earn as much as a second or third-class teacher, which is a mismatch between responsibility and pay. Among these clerks, there are many highly capable individuals or those with excellent English foundations.</p>
<p>○ Low Tuition Fees: The tuition fees of schools established by the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) were roughly equivalent to those of municipal schools before the Incident (referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War). After the Incident, they were lower than those of any other school. This is because tuition fees only covered a small portion of the school's expenses. In the spring of 1943, secondary schools only charged a little over one hundred yuan, and primary schools charged just over thirty yuan. Although these were meager sums, the following regulations were also in place:</p>
<p>One: Tuition fees were not uniform across all schools. Before the Incident, there was a detailed investigation into the monthly income of the parents of students at each school, and statistics were compiled. Schools where the average student's family was in difficult financial circumstances had lower tuition fees, while those where families were better off had higher fees. Generally, schools located in industrial and commercial areas had lower tuition fees, while those in residential areas had higher fees.</p>
<p>Two: Establishment of Free Places: In addition to students from primary schools who obtained scholarships and were entitled to free tuition, any secondary school student with two or more siblings enrolled could apply for [proportional free tuition]. Families in particularly dire financial straits could also apply for exemptions based on precedent. As for primary schools, it was stipulated that one-tenth of the total number of students at each school should be granted full exemption from tuition and the cost of books and supplies. One-twentieth of the total number of students should be granted half exemption from all fees, in order to show preferential treatment to poor students. This low tuition fee and free tuition policy may be one of the reasons why many students applied to SMC Chinese schools.</p>
<p>Three: Increase in the Number of Low-Fee Schools: In the spring of 1936, in order to enroll more out-of-school children, the SMC specially established half-day SMC primary schools in densely populated poor areas of industrial and commercial districts (Peng Road). These schools enrolled as many as 1,600 students, and the tuition fee was about one-fifth of that of other schools. Books and supplies were provided completely free of charge, while school facilities and teacher quality were no different from those of other full-day primary schools. After the Incident, although the school buildings were moved several times, this low-fee system was preserved.</p>
<p>○ Close Liaison Between Schools and the Various Departments Within the SMC:</p>
<p>In the SMC system, various departments seemed to be connected, and schools were no exception. Specific aspects are detailed below:</p>
<p>One: Liaison with the Finance Department: Although Chinese schools under the SMC had sufficient funding, school authorities had no power over circulating funds. Apart from teachers' salaries, which were paid monthly by the Finance Department, they only had a few dozen yuan in cash each month for purchasing items. All purchases were made by placing orders with major companies and stores using a purchase order, without paying cash. The principal would then send the invoices to the Finance Department for reimbursement. After the Finance Department approved the invoices, the stores could collect payment directly from the Finance Department, without the school's involvement. This was intended to prevent corruption. The difficulty was that if the Finance Department did not approve the purchase of necessary items, it would cause a major problem.</p>
<p>Two: Liaison with the Health Department: The Health Department had school inspectors and a school medical section. The former was responsible for inspecting the cleanliness of the school environment, drinking water facilities, toilets, and grounds; whether the number of students in the classrooms was too crowded; and the construction, lighting, and ventilation of school buildings. The latter checked the students' physical condition at a specific time each day. What is particularly noteworthy is that when doctors discovered that children were suffering from illnesses, they immediately notified the school authorities for isolation. Strict disinfection was carried out in cases of infectious diseases. Sick children were not allowed to attend school without a doctor's [certificate allowing them to attend class]. Children who were absent from school due to illness were also visited by nurses who would visit their homes to provide guidance on care, seeking medical attention, and other methods of dealing with illnesses. Moreover, the annual regular injections of typhoid fever vaccines, and vaccinations for disease prevention or smallpox, were routine matters.</p>
<p>Three: Liaison with the Engineering Department: All repairs and additions to school buildings were the responsibility of the Engineering Department. The Engineering Department regularly sent personnel to inspect and assist or supervise the maintenance of school buildings, the management of grounds, and the handling of general school facilities. In addition, all routine engineering maintenance of the school, such as roof leaks, broken doors and windows, cracked floors, damaged walls, and broken desks and chairs, only required a request for repairs to be submitted to the Engineering Department, which would immediately instruct workers to carry out the repairs. The expenses were paid from the school's budget, which was transferred by the Finance Department.</p>
<p>Four: Liaison with the Fire Department: The Fire Department regularly sent personnel to the school to guide staff and students in the use of fire-fighting equipment and to teach various fire prevention methods. At the same time, it rigorously inspected all fire-fighting equipment at appropriate times each year.</p>
<p>○ Characteristics of the Facilities:</p>
<p>Chinese schools under the SMC had significant differences in facilities before and after the Incident. About half of the schools could not return to their original school buildings and had to rent temporary school buildings for classes. As for school equipment and all facilities, much was lost. Although some schools made every effort to maintain the original facilities, it was difficult to restore the old appearance after the devastation. The following describes the general state of the facilities of typical schools:</p>
<p>○ School Buildings:</p>
<p>Some Chinese schools under the SMC had school foundations or funding donated by Chinese and foreign gentry and merchants, with the SMC constructing the school buildings (such as the Hua Tong Public School, Nie Zhongcheng Public School, and Ge Zhi Public School). Some donated self-built school buildings to the SMC (Yu Cai Public School). Other school buildings were mostly built or purchased by the SMC alone, as SMC property. Because funding was sufficient at the time, and the designs were excellent, most of the school buildings were magnificent and imposing in Shanghai. In particular, the construction expenses for the Girls' Middle School, Xinzha Road Primary School, and Jingzhou Road Primary School each reached 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. If the prices at that time were compared with the current prices, the cost of just one school building would be more than ten million yuan. The greatness of the engineering and the solidity of the construction go without saying. It was seen during the Incident that the Jingzhou Road Primary School was hit by a shell from a large cannon, and all the glass was shattered, but the school building only had one hole and no other damage.</p>
<p>○ Spacious Grounds:</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where land is worth its weight in gold, but Chinese schools under the SMC mostly had spacious grounds, averaging more than ten mu. Moreover, many trees were planted, and lawns were laid, creating a peaceful and secluded atmosphere in the playgrounds and campuses. In the heart of a bustling metropolis, it was a world apart, truly a school with an excellent environment.</p>
<p>○ General Equipment of School Buildings:</p>
<p>Newer school buildings mostly had spacious and grand auditoriums that could accommodate all the school's students, and gyms. There were also cinema rooms, physics and chemistry laboratories, natural science rooms, woodworking rooms, music rooms, and so on, almost without exception. The cleanliness of the toilets was particularly noteworthy. In addition, there were desks and chairs suitable for children's height (primary schools would have the Chinese Education Department design and manufacture over a thousand sets of high, medium, and low-grade desks and chairs that were lightweight and sturdy, with separate desks and chairs that could be moved freely), non-reflective rotating blackboards, spring curtains that did not obstruct vision, clean sand-filtered water for multiple people to drink, door stops to prevent students from crowding and colliding when entering and exiting, etc. These were all special facilities. However, all of the above facilities had to be inspected and repaired by the Engineering Department at any time to maintain their efficiency. Otherwise, once damaged, not only would repairs be difficult, but they would also hinder school management.</p>
<p>○ Library Facilities:</p>
<p>The library resources of each school were not complete. There was only a small library fee each year, which was only enough to cover consumption and not enough to add new books. Even the existing books were only suitable for a small number of people to read, and the scope was narrow. All of this was not commendable. Therefore, most schools had to adopt a circulating library system or borrow books from each other in rotation to make up for the deficiency.</p>
