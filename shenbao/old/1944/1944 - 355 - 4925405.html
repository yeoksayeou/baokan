<h3>菲島陸軍最高指揮官　山下大將訪問記</h3>
<p>在不滿四十里平方的雷伊泰島狹隘的天地中，現正繼續着一賭日美國運的血戰。就是在這一瞬間，也不知道有多少忠勇的將士，揮着白刃，突擊敵陣哩，在這力與力的相角之間，決定了一切的一切。十二月六日，記者訪菲島方面陸軍最高指揮官山下奉文大將於軍司令部，得聆山下大將充滿自信的言談，甚爲欣慰。司令部是面對一排高機的簡陋小屋。在大的紗窗下，山下大將凭桌而坐，正在批閱公文。訪問的對手旣是這位威風凜凜的將軍，自然呌人不得不感到相當緊張。山下大半似乎已看出記者的心事，含笑道：</p>
<p>「不抽烟嗎？」他的桌上，堆滿了雷伊春的地圖。望着這些地面，山下將軍或許正在思考如何殲滅美軍哩。</p>
<p>「雷伊泰總是一個島呀！」他好像不頂喜歡抽煙，祇勸記者扣，自己卻碰也不碰，滿意似地望着記者吸煙，忽然說出這句話來、他的意思，可以猜到是說：「補給非常重要哪！」接着，他怕人問詢似地繼續接下去說：</p>
<p>「可是，譬如你到九州去，乘了火車之後，還得趁輪船。到馬賽去，也是同樣。總之，距離縱有長短，手續總是一樣的。就是這個原故。」</p>
<p>「敵方正在大事宣傳，不僅在雷伊泰，還要在呂宋島的拉蒙灣上陸哩」</p>
<p>「如果眞到拉蒙灣來，那眞要謝天謝地了，因爲那樣的話，我們不必渡海就可戰爭啦！哈，哈，哈……」</p>
<p>三架戰鬥機很整齊地列隊飛過樹梢。山下大將似乎看出記者神經上的這種小小衝動。</p>
<p>「那是友軍飛機呀！貴鄉是何處哪？什麼，是福岡？福岡很多豪傑呀？」</p>
<p>接着，記者洗耳恭聽將軍發揮不要爲了平常事情膽怯的宏論。</p>
<p>「將軍是那裏人？」</p>
<p>「我嗎？我是京都的花花公子呀！看不出來嗎？哈哈，哈……」</p>
<p>說是貴公子，倒眞是貴公子，他還是土佐出身呢。</p>
<p>不過，現在算是東京人了。美國鬼子來轟炸東京，眞呌人憤恨。一定要在雷伊泰報仇！」</p>
<p>「祗要補給良好，穩操勝勢。」</p>
<p>不過，這邊說好時，對方也很不錯，這點必須知道。自今以後，雷伊泰方面是多雨了，士兵們可眞勞苦，但願不是徒然</p>
<p>山下大將這一年來已一比從前胖了。肚子挺得更出了。身體很健，精神甚佳。記者訪晤的目的已經達到，當即吿辭，並祝他珍重。</p>
<p>「你的臉色不很好，什麼地方不舒服嗎？」大將很親切地問道。</p>
<p>的確，記者在數日以前曾患鄧克熟病，熟度高到三十九度，今天也是爲了可和大將晤面才扶病出來的。</p>
<p>「噢，是頭痛還是胃痛？」</p>
<p>「唔，原來如此！胃口不開嗎？那末，吃這個馬上會好。」他從內室拿了一瓶健胃錠出來說。</p>
<p>他如此誠摯對待記者，呌人感激不已。記者便將健胃錠小心放在袋裏，走出司令部。</p>

<h3>雷伊泰日軍猛攻　兩岸地區激戰中　日有力空軍急襲敵機場</h3>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍某基地二十五日中央社電　日軍航空部隊，二十三日夜以有力部隊急襲雷伊泰島塔克羅班，塔拉克兩機塲，予敵軍相當損害後，安返基地。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍某基地二十五日中央社電　日軍刻在雷伊泰東海岸奪取布羅音，桑巴布羅兩機場，並猛攻塔拉克敵機塲，阻礙敵軍使用。近數日在持羅薩（塔拉克北方）正不分晝夜展開熾烈之突入戰，一部日軍突入敵新建之塔諾曼機塲，似使敵物資倉庫受創甚重，敵方情報亦承認此等事實。又日軍在奧爾莫克北方構築堅陣，連日猛攻雷鳥兩岸地區敵軍，刻仍在激戰中。敵一部隊曾於十八日被日軍右翼迂迴，圖侵入巴北曼，亦遭日軍猛攻而被擊退。至十九日敵戰意愈低下，現已退向奧爾草克西北方。</p>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　雷伊泰島美陸海軍傷亡甚眾，而輸血用血液之需要亦急激增加，據珍珠灣合衆社二十三日電報傳，移自美太平洋岸向菲律賓所運送之第一回輸血用血液，由空路經數日後始達奧爾莫克後防醫院，然負傷兵士充滿醫院，所送血液僅七日即完全用盡，更要求急速遝送三倍量之血液，故太平洋岸之紅十字會當局，須向從來提供血液之舊金山，俄克蘭，洛衫磯及波特蘭，聖地亞哥兩市要求援助供血液。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>上海人口疏散問題</h3>
<p>上海的人口，雖未正確統計過，約計總在五百萬左右。這樣龐大的人口，對於今天上海的繁榮，不能否認由這些人來支持。然而，我們細加分析，又不能不承認這繁榮的後面，隱伏着可怕的危機，我們稍會淸醒的去想一想，就不難會「如臨深淵，如履薄冰」起來。最近上海物價，受米價暴漲的領導，波動劇烈，可謂空前，使上海市民十分之七八都受到嚴重威脅。市政府當局及有關方面，咸視爲非常嚴重的問題，採取有效的對策，在法律方面，宜佈適用戰時刑事特別法，以保障人民的安全；在食糧方面，考慮米糧配給重點主義，都以上海市民中十分之七八的貧困階層爲設想，調整目前不合理的現象。我們是不是有了足量準期的配給，就可以無所顧慮呢？不能的，我們中國是大東亞戰爭中參戰國之一，一切在軍事第一的戰時現象下，民衆有犧牲小我成全大我以促進大東亞戰爭必勝的義務，我們不能因民需而影饗到軍需的重要。而且，戰爭愈趨入決戰階段，一切物資以供軍需的要求更殷，運輸物資的工具也以軍需爲急。我們必須設法把消耗量儘量減少，這是今天有遠見的上海人應有的義務。</p>
<p>儘量減少消耗量，可以求之於統制和節約。如果全上海五百萬市民，個個能够做到理想的節約，但是，五百萬市民的消耗，還須從上海以外的地區運來。物資的缺乏，運轍的不暢，固然造成了今日物價的嚴重，威脅到生活，這種嚴重，這種威脅，何嘗不是上海市民消耗量太大的綠故。所以眞正的抑平物價，足量準期的配給，減少消耗量，還須疏散上海人口，較能澈底。</p>
<p>其次，南部住宅區，再度被敵美機肓炸後，無辜市民，不幸被累死傷。，此後，慘無人道的敵美機可能繼續殘酷的盲炸。盟邦駐軍的防空力量足以壓制敵美機的蠢動，市民已作萬全的準備。但是我們不能恃此無患。敵美機的轟炸，破壞生產外，主要的作用在神經戰，想以慘無人道的濫炸，擾亂和平地區的人心，作爲戰術之一。戰爭勝利的條件，是物力和人力，戰勝之後，人力尤見重要，我們爲了戰爭勝利，須保全人力，須運用人力於增產方面，爲了戰後建設新中國，亦須保全人力。我們不能把人力作無謂的犧牲，必須疏散。盟邦日本大都市早已疏散人口，上海人口如此稠密，實有疏散必要。</p>
<p>我們相信許多市民中有考慮回鄕的問題，主要的困難在交通不便，使他們躊躇不能決。疏散人口問題，客觀上的需要，已經成熟，須要市府當局週密妥善計劃，動員起來。但是我們覺得疏散人口必須顧到：</p>
<p>第一，動員保甲人民團體，同鄉會等組織人口疏散委員會。採取自動疏散和强逼疏散兩種。同時沿途各站設招待處，優待歸鄕者。</p>
<p>第二，交通上絕對的給予便利或免費，指定陸海上交通工具專爲疏散人口用。行李携帶，限量不應太少，訂明携帶行李範圍，檢查手續須求簡便，嚴禁留難勒索等貪汚。</p>
<p>第三，老弱婦孺先行疏散。貽害治安的地痞流氓，擾亂社會的淘金分子，以及徒增物資消耗的寓公等都在疏散之列。</p>
<h3>冬季治螟各項工作要點　各地當局應切實推行</h3>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　凡在稻作曾受螟蟲之害的地方，每畝之稻作作，列舉要點於後，以便施行：</p>
<p>（甲）掘毀或拾毀稻糧之未化螟蟲之幼蟲，恒在稻核內，故在已經冬耕而種作冬作的田裏，應將稻根拾取集合，其在未予冬耕及休閒的田裏，應將稻根拾取，集合上項稻根，可依照左列各法處理之：（一）將稻根單獨堆積，使螟蟲受天乾及寒冬之影響，致腐杌斃死，或將稻根與河泥放在田旁，層壘成堆，以致可充肥料。（二將）稻根與　乾的柴草混合堆稻根積田旁，用火焚燒，俾作肥料之用。（三）在人口充足之農家，可掘深坑，將稻根埋藏其內，待腐爛，充作肥料。（四）或將稻根曬乾後，以充作家庭用柴薪。</p>
<p>（乙）實行冬耕，休閒地應以犂施行冬耕，使稻根翻起後，受天寒之侵襲，自能使幼蟲死亡。</p>
<p>（丙）休閒地灌水，凡在螟蟲被較劇之稻田，而爲休閒之地，如灌溉便利，宜於冬季灌水入田，灌水之深度，以掩沒稻根爲限，經五十日後，凡稻根內之幼蟲，自然爛死。</p>
<p>（丁）開做草堆，在發見二化螟蟲之地方，如農家有剩餘之稻草，擬留存明春使用者應將其稻根部向內，尖端向外，堆積四草薦叵蘆葦包圍，用繩上縛緊，以囚禁孵化螟。蛾之飛出產卵，而絕其繁殖。日本海軍「雷電」式新銳飛機出發索敵</p>

<h3>耶誕節教皇廣播　希望永久和平　戰後須有合理組織產生</h3>
<p>梵蒂岡二十五日中央社電　海通社訊：敎皇庇護士十二世今年之聖誕演說，對世界之遍地烽火，深表悲痛。關於國家之關係，則希望能於戰後有足以保障戰勝者與戰敗者合理和平之組織產出。敎皇謂，戰爭期內作聖誕演說，此已爲第六次，自黑暗之中發生一種希望，盼此次戰爭可爲另一新時代之起點。敎會並不預聞國家之形式，但對於政府之是吾關懷公衆福利，則至爲重視。例如民生政體雖爲共和國家之原則，但君主國家內亦未始不可存在。敎皇繼謂，人民與民衆有所不同，民衆乃政府之工具，而人民則有其地位，並明瞭其責任。敎皇於最後主張永遠消滅一切侵略之戰事，如果有維持和平之組織產出，則必須能一視同仁，無分戰勝者與戰敗者，切不可對任何國給與特殊之優待。</p>
<h3>德國民族前程　充滿無限光輝　耶誕前夕郭培爾廣播</h3>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　德宣傳部長郭培爾在聖誕節前夕對國民廣播如次：過去一年間乃德國史上空前之一年，德國民衆向未曾逢如此命運，然德國民在此一年中，曾發揮英雄的抗戰態度，德國民若無如此堅韌之精神力，則德國民恐不能居有今日之地步。余確信德國民之前程，充滿無限光輝，戰局之現狀及將來，即可證明金余之信念異常正確，德國民之抗戰力及攻擊力，使敵驚駭而羨慕，德國民不惟如敵之預言而結束其命運，反而使之洞悉德國民仍有偉大之將來。在一星期前，西綫德軍轉守爲攻，其精神力旺盛與戰力之大，業使世界讚譽不已，德軍將兵此次之壯舉，無人不表欽佩之意。德國民誓於希特勒元首身邊，祈禱元首萬福，同時余向德國民傳達元首於聖誕節與民衆共同忍耐戰爭之艱苦。元首縝日終夜思慮國事，敵方曾傳元首患病，然元首始終健康，精神旺盛非常，元首所欲向世界宣吿，在適當之時期將使聞聽元首以不動之信念與決意？觀今後之戰局進展，德軍將利用所有良機，予敵以大打擊，過去數星期敵方曾圖離間元首與國民之策，然在此次西綫新攻勢展開前數星期，元首曾畫夜爲德國民之前途苦心劃策，一俟時機來臨，戰局將有適當之解答</p>
<h3>皖淮兩省重劃新界址</h3>
<p>蚌埠二十五日中央社電　關於皖省淮海省奉令重劃省界一事，業由皖淮兩省當局遴派大員，於本月十三日前往劃定，於新馬橋與曹老集間，劃定自津浦綫磨盤張以南三百公尺處作爲新界址，連日已繪就圖樣，將呈行政院備案。</p>

<h3>渝方拒絕延安提案</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十五日中央社電　據倫敦電：記事報二十四日曾揭載加爾各答訊稱，中共代表周恩來帶到重慶之延安提案，即要求樹立聯合政府及一元統帥之提議，全被渝方拒絕。此外尙謂華南之戰局雖極緊急，然蔣氏使延安代表之周恩來於重慶等候一星期餘，始與之會見，會談大的三十分，蔣氏態度異常傲慢，周恩來目下已歸返延安。</p>
<h3>希境戰事　擴至西北部</h3>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　據雅典電：愛拉斯團的兩萬，頃向希臘西北部右翼遊擊隊愛迭斯團之根據地亞尼那地方突入中，自此希臘內亂終於普及全國。英軍司令斯柯比二十三日發表公報謂，愛拉斯攻擊愛迭斯團，實爲侵犯公約之挑戰行爲，觀此可知愛拉斯團對解決方案之回答，並未能使英軍滿足。所謂前者之協定，乃孫英軍於希臘登陸之前，愛拉斯與愛迭斯左右兩戰之協定。</p>
<p>左派軍答覆英勸降要求</p>
<p>瑞典京十五日中央社電　海通社訊：倫敦昨公布希臘叛軍對英軍司令斯柯比將軍勸降之答覆，內稱，希京及比拉斯之愛拉斯軍準備與對方同時交出武器，或撤退或自願繳械，惟要求最近自中東調來之希臘軍須撤離雅典，愛拉斯方面復要求解散憲兵，並解除前安全部隊及警察之武裝，同時並謂英軍之活動亦與卡塞太協定不甚符合。</p>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　傳希臘英駐軍司令斯柯比對愛拉斯團之回答，且下正起草復答案，此次回答中，因愛拉斯團排斥英政府之干涉希臘內政，英軍絕難承認。據路透社雅典訊，聖誕休戰之希望完全消滅，因之雅典市內之戰鬥依然繼續。英空軍已佔據阿克羅波利士兩側，傳已奪取雅典市之瓦斯公司，但雅典市內之中央發電廠仍在愛拉斯織手中。</p>

<p>敎育事業爲民族命脈所寄，極爲重要要　關於和平區域內中小學敎育情况，記者以前數决旅行通訊中曾經提及，大槪情形，不外實心從事於中小學敎育之人，無不感覺生活清苦，大有朝不保夕之勢，尤以師資極感缺乏，難免濫竽充數，每决不厭繁瑣，重複提到，無非欲促當局之注意。現在就實地觀察所得，再來談談首都之大學敎育，想亦關心敎育者所樂聞。最高學府之中央大學槪况，日前本報所載京行瑣記中業已提到，無庸再贅。現在所說的孫南京僅有的三個私立大學——中國公學，建村農學院，南方大學—但是嚴格的說，除中國公學設有文法商三個學院，具備大學形態外。其他二校，僅有二學院或竟一學院，不過所敎授者，全係大學踝程，謂之爲大學中之獨立學院未爲不可，故統稱之爲大學敎育。且這三個學校，各有各的特色，各有各的精神，實屬値得爲文介紹。茲分述如下：</p>
<p>自治的中國公學</p>
<p>先有學生，後有學校，中國公學創辦之由來，在吾國敎育史上開一新紀元，復有許多可歌可泣之事蹟留於人間，如創辦人姚宏業先生竟以自殺以促學校之成立，其遺書迄今猶保存，視作校訓，以資紀念。其後人材輩出，在學術界及其他各方面貢獻甚多，如胡適之任鴻　以及黃花崗烈士數人，皆出身於該校，慘淡經營，規模漸具。事變以前，在吳淞已有宏大校舍，並有一切學術上之設備。惜完全燬於兵燹，實學術界之一大損失。國府還都以後，該校畢業生許遜公龍英傑鄭雅秋諸氏，適均在南京，本學生自治的一貫精神，主張復校，三十一年夏即吿成立。現時校長爲翦建午氏，副校長爲龍英傑氏，校舍係前立法院原址，內部在軍變前頗有亭台樓閣之盛，附會者並謂大觀園即係該處，在廿六年大部均燬於砲火，現經修葺，勉作課堂之用，設有文法商三系，共有學生三百餘人，課程相當認眞，學生程度水準亦尙不差，每星期日上午有師生談話會，由龍副校長主持，對於學校任何問題，學生皆可建議與批評，始終不背該校創辦時之光榮精神。至校款來源的，除一部分捐款外，每學期所收學生學費，實屬不足維持，龍英傑君坦白說明，他們幾個敎職員另作他種商業以養學校，絕對不要學校養他們，熱心敎育，令人起敬。</p>
<p>實幹的建村農學院</p>
<p>建村農學院係中國工讀團事業之一部，院長爲農學博士鐵明君，其經費來源大多由董事長丁默邨君支持。該校現分三系—農業敎育系，農藝系，園藝系—共有學生一百餘名，內有女生九人，課程絕對認眞，尤注重實地騐習，並取銷寒暑放假之慣例，以免荒廢時日，敎授則有童玉民顧心梅沈紱王歷農湯銘新諸氏，皆國內農學界有地位之士。學生膳宿完全免費，師生職員制服式樣一律，食則同桌，宿則同舍，並無任何軒輊，好像一農村的大家庭。記者前往參觀時，見正在該校附近標本區內及蔬菜繁殖區內田間工作之男女學生，荷鋤挑糞，整地澆水，精神飽滿，態度和靄，令人不勝敬愛。且學生莫不體格堅强，面色紅潤，足見當時有規則之工作運動，於身體大有益處。聞該校炊事以及灑掃等事，均由學生自行管理，全校僅僱用司閣一人，此種上下實幹精神，實爲該校一大特色。在復興農村及增加生產上，該校學生不失爲可靠之基本幹部。惜爲經費所限，一切設備及訓練方面，尙不能完全合乎理想，亟望政府與社會極力支持。</p>
<p>方便的南方大學</p>
<p>江亢虎先生創設之南方大學，由北京而上海，由上海而南京，成績如何，自有社會定評，無庸記者嘵舌。惟江先生辦學之一貫精神，良堪敬佩。南大移京以後，設有文法兩學院，男女學生共的三百人，文學院長係蔡鼎成氏，法學院長係陳彥通氏。該校爲適應一般職業男女，上課全在晚間，名之曰夜間大學亦無不可。學生中除男女公務員及各種從業員外，並有幾個六根淸凈之和尙在內。據說課程好，精神亦好，謂爲方便，誰日不宜。（寄自南京）</p>

<h3>本市金融機構　財部決謀穩定　不健全金融機關有相當措置</h3>
<p>本市整個金融事業，自經財政部頒布綱要，實施強化以來，日漸穩定，其資力雄厚歷史悠久之金融機關。業務亦益形堅固，共實力薄弱，過去專營投機囤積事業，或濫行放欵之金融機關，均受嚴重打擊，並且逐漸淘汰。最近因年關在即，各方紛紛辦理決算，而當局强化金融機關之限期日迫，間有數家行莊，無力强化業務機構者，發生動搖或有準備辦理淸理情事。一般不明事實者，造成誤傳流言，對於商民資產保障，影響匪淺。中央社記者爲明瞭眞相起見，特走助金融機關權威方面，據稱財政部當局，鑒於過去二年來，上海金融機關業務畸形繁榮，新創設之銀行錢莊，如雨後春筍，但中央儲備銀行檢查金融事務處年來嚴密檢查，其間遵守政府方面所頌佈之管理余融機關暫行辦法規定，經營正當業務者，固屬甚多，但其中資產負債不符法定條文，而利用吸引存欵之資金，暗中經營投機事業，或囤積物資及濫泛放欵業務者，亦不在少數。此種情形不獨擾亂金融之安定，且足激刺物價之高漲，如遇物價之反動或投機之失敗，則妨害商民資產之保陣，故財政部爲安定滬市金融抑平物價，保護商民資產安全計，不得不强化金融機關，穩固業務基礎，施行增强資本金額，檢查資產負債及存放限制之嚴峻措置。自此次强化政策進行實施以來，各金融機關均已遵奉法合履行，其中因吸收存欵不能滿足限制總額，而增資無力之金融機關，勢必自動停閉，或將合併改組，繼續維持業務。現聞財政部當局對於此種不健全之金融機關，已有相當之措置，決以妥善方法解決，一方面體恤金融機關業務之艱苦，同時絕對維護商民資金之保陣，而不受絲毫之影響，使上海路個金融機構，在此過程中，得以堅持穩定。</p>
<h3>警局對社團登記　展至年底截止　不登記者將嚴令解散</h3>
<p>本市警察局前奉市政再有一部份子誤解當局意旨，以爲此次登記，爲對於該團體有令其改組或施以不必要干涉等情，故有躊躇遲延之傾向，該局向以維特治安爲主要目標而實施登記，如職員中有藉登記加以不正當之干涉或要求金錢者，將斷乎加以處罰。此次登記無論舊租界時代之已登記團體，戚向國府及市政府等其他機關登記者，並市政府所支援者，或半官半私等一切團體，均有登記之必要，望勿誤爲盼，如前記期間中仍有不行登記者，將照章嚴令解散，特此喚起各團體注意。</p>
<h3>地檢署改善　幼年犯處分</h3>
<p>上海地方檢察署，爲改善處分幼年人犯，以期迅連結案起見，爰特訂定改善辦法，凡各該幼年犯有家屬者，則隨時賀付其家屬，嚴予管敎外，無家屬者之幼年人狐媚，則送至上海地方法院予以質付保安處分，聞已分飭該署各檢察官等，一體切實遵行</p>
<h3>保甲處催繳保甲費</h3>
<p>本市警察局保甲處，自統一所屬各區保甲經費，業於本年七月份起，開始統一征收，茲以本年九十月份併征保甲經費，各區猶有未繳解者，保甲處當局將令知各區總聯保即向處會計室繳解。再該處爲調整征收保甲經費，特於明年三十四年度一月份起，有所調整，刻正擬訂方案。</p>
<h3>經濟局調查耕牛數量</h3>
<p>本市經濟局增產科，以本年農村生產力，較往年減少，據該科派員調查，實因四鄉農村經濟破產之唯一原因，主要農具墨守舊法，技術無法改進。耕牛缺乏，人力物力，進行迂緩，故推行增產工作，成效有限。且本年中央規定爲增產年，推行冬耕，爲整備來年增產主要工作之一，該局有鑒於斯，特着手訂定調查各縣耕牛數量，以期設法協助農民，俾增產工作，得以順利推進。</p>
<h3>昨雲南起義日　市府舉行紀念儀式</h3>
<p>昨（二十五）日爲雲南起義紀念日，市府於是日上午十時，在江西路市府大禮堂舉行絕念儀式，計到本市各局處長及高級人員，由孫主任秘書理甫代表吳秘書長出席，報吿雲南起義之意義，迄十時半，始吿禮成。</p>
<p>昨（二十五）已爲雲南起義紀念日，本市保安司令部除特派余參謀處長世傑，張總務處長應奎，吳主任秘書農，及淸鄕事務局第二科長沈志才，封鎖管理處長　處長碩等，專赴市府參加紀念大會外，並於九時在該部大禮堂召集全體官佐舉行紀念儀式，由熊參謀長劍東主席，除將當日先烈之革命精神與事迹，加以闡述外，並諄諄訓勉所屬，在此大市亞決戰期內，務須繼武光烈，共同努力，俾此艱鉅之使命，早底於成。</p>
<h3>各區保甲應增設　防空工作團　協助空襲災區救護</h3>
<p>據市民防空本部發言人語中央社記者云：「遲來渝美敵機爲企圖擾亂後方人心及破壞治安，已一再來滬侵襲，向平民住區，濫施轟炸，以致無辜民衆，慘遭非殃，殊爲憤懣，當局除對遭殃之災民表示萬分同情，並設法予以救濟外，希望市民對防空設備，加緊充實各項防空措置，俾防空陣營，得以强化。同時各區保甲防空團體，應增設工作團，挑選優良團員，以誠懇之精神服務，一旦發生不幸之空襲事件後，全體即須出動協助。查過去教次被襲災區之實地工作人員，甚感缺乏，致使受傷難民，不能一一即速救議，是以增設防空團員，愈感必要</p>
<h3>水兵訓練所　定期開學</h3>
<p>中央水兵訓練所第十二期練兵及中央商船普通船員養成所第二期船員學生，均已分別招攷就緒，定於本月二十九日上午十時在南市半淞園路該校舉行開學典禮，屆時海軍部長，亦將蒞臨主持。</p>
<h3>香燭稅總局長　發表施政方針</h3>
<p>國府財政部香燭稅總局長一職，業經令派蘇浙滬箔類稅總局局長張浩然調充，張氏業於日昨到局接篆視事，並就今後推行香燭稅政，發表抱負如後：「香燭稅政乃政府新頒稅收之一，皆在管理一般香燭銷售稅務，進而充裕國庫，本人當秉承當局宗旨，努力奉行，查過去香米稅政，一般商人未能按照當局旨意，致碍稅收進行，此點本人當極力設法改正，深盼商民予以協力，俾得圓滑推動」。</p>

<h3>效法「武訓」行乞興精神　輸財尙義不容或緩</h3>
<p>近幾天上海有三家電影院映「義丐」，此片是描寫古時山東「武訓」行乞興學的故事，看過的人，一定很多，不知看了作何感想？「武訓」是個乞丐，乞丐是三十六行中最苦而最使人討厭的行業，但何以他能留芳百世呢？簡單的說，便是他向人求乞，得來的錢，辦學校，便地方貧苦子弟都龍求學，所謂「十年生聚，十年教訓」，別的人不做，而「武訓」却有一貫的精神，始終如一的做着，非但如此，他，還有一種獨特的作風，便是人家不給他錢，他就長跪不去，在校不用功讀書的學生，也對他長脆不去，因此人家總有錢給他，校裏經費有他感人之深，可說功夫獨到。像「武訓」這樣的人，犧牲了畢生的光陰和精力，專爲貧苦兒童謀福利，眞是千古奇蹟！本報歷屆辦理助學金，一面向各界呼籲，捐助金錢；一面輔導學生，使其學有精進，這心念簡直有幾分與「武訓」相像；我們也願意效「武訓」精神，每天向各方奔走呼籲，務望助學運動能够成功，則，應知奮起助學，爲當前急務，請人家來贊助我們的「武訓精神」！</p>
<p>約翰學生集體助學</p>
<p>本報前幾天曾主張助學須發揮「集體」的力量，並望初中以止各校，都來至少認助一隊，意思是有錢的學生，幫助無力的學生，正如義兄難弟，唇齒相輔，乃是有意義的任務。果然聞風而起的學校很多，昨天又有聖的翰大學敎育系及土木學院的同學，合作七隊之多，並承楊寬麟，傳統先兩敎授首先發起，各同學一致贊成，於是七隊助金，立刻凑齊，諸位的熱情，使人非常感動。據說其他各系同學，也有繼起募集的動機，大約的還有好幾隊可以認定。本來能升大學的學生，其家境雖有不少是淸寒的，赤貧的，而中產以上殷富鉅商的子弟，也不在少數，只要要發一念之善，大家來幫忙淸寒同學，凑集起來，成績也很可觀。一個大學數百或千餘學生，「集體」認他十隊二十隊，也很容易，事在人爲，何難之有？願的大學生，領導於前，各校繼起於後，幸甚盼甚。</p>
<p>董筱鼎君攝影義展</p>
<p>君筱鼎，自幼則醉心藝術，數年以來，在上海美專專攻圖案及西洋畫，頗有心得，成績優良，課餘之暇，更悉心研究攝影術，今擬將所攝作品，擇其精美而富有藝術性者，凡七十餘幅，分別放大，配以美麗鏡框，將於新春一月一日起至四日止，在八仙橋靑年會圖書館舉行攝影義展，即將售得之款，除去成本，一槪捐助申新兩報助貸學金，熱忱可佩，屆時當有一番盛况。</p>
<p>昨收助金　汪可三四千元，孫毓記二千元，張錦興八百元，吳翠珍，韋劍英各五百元，浦緝庭一百元，共收儲券七千九百元，結存七百〇三萬五千〇二十三元</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>爲四千餘學子請命</h3>
<p>本報在讀者諸君熱忱指導和鼓勵之下，辦理助學金事宜已歷七屆。學生人數和助學金額都是一屆比一屆增加，這一方面表示靑年學子需要救助之殷切，一方面表示讀者諸君之愛護靑年熱心敎育。</p>
<p>本報根據上屆受助學生人數及預測，下學期學費之增加額，規定本屆勸募目標爲二千萬元，這實在是一個最低限度的數目。最近數週來物價的上漲，使我們深深感覺到這二千萬元實在是不够的。照目前社會經濟的狀况，下屈請求助金學生人數或者要倍於上屆，而學校學費之增加，說不定要三倍四倍，對於受本報助金的四千餘莘莘學子，如何使他們學業不輟，這件事眞使本報同人焦慮萬狀，眠食不安，無時去　的。</p>
<p>但是我們每每回想到以前數屆讀者諸君對於助學運動之熟忱贊助和慷慨輸將，又使我們得到無限的勇氣和信心，相信以助學運動之重要，祗要大家分頭努力，不難達到預期的目標，相信以讀者諸君對於靑年學子已往的關切，決不忍坐視他們學業荒廢，使四年來親手所栽培灌溉的花木，萎縮枯槁，使大家功虧一簣，前功盡棄。</p>
<p>本屆勸募辦法早已在報端露布，希望在本月之內完成這二千萬元勸募的目標。現在　　民國三十三年亦就是我們預定勸募期最後一星期，謹以滿腔的血忱爲四千餘可愛的年向讀者諸君請命。我們深信在這堅要關頭，大家必能盡最大的努力來促成這件社會上最關重要最有意義的工作。</p>

<h3>昨慈善足球賽　東華和聯誼　二比二不分勝負</h3>
<p>一年一度慈善足球賽，由東華出戰聯誼，昨上午十時，在逸園舉行，觀衆人山人海，擠得水洩不通，不下萬餘人，然昨賽演出，大失球迷所望，二隊在不努力之表演下，以二比二和局，勝負不分，似早在球迷預料中也。兩陣旣圓，東華先攻，幼良派司龍海、小韓馬到成功，聯誼旣失一球，再行反攻？東華守衛將士，竟以禮讓姿態，不加阻止，義臣跌腿起處，球入網嘆，一比一距開賽時，不過十分鐘。此後雙方演出，客氣萬分，始終發揮球員之運動精神道德，直至二十七鐘時，李垚橫射命中，二比一結束上半時，東華領先。再戰聲中，聯誼攻勢猖獗，鄭英權於約二十八分鐘時建功，二比二扳成和局。迨法定時間吿終，雙方各二言和，皆大歡喜。</p>

<h3>介紹一個　免費閱覽室</h3>
<p>在這飢寒交迫的時候，一般人正爲着米珠薪桂而勞碌奔波，這固然是身當大時代的人們應該經歷的苦難，然而人爲萬物之靈，維持生命的，除了柴米油鹽之外，還需相當的精神食糧，尤其是青年人，求智慾正旺，沒有書報閱讀，定必感覺苦悶不堪言狀。然而書報閱讀談何容易，學校裏匪但參考書缺乏，即使是敎科書也不易置備完全，定期刊物更不必說了。巧得很，有一次在北風凜冽的氣候中，我在泰山路（舊　飛路）踱着，忽然給我發現了一個極好的去處，當時眞使我驚喜欲狂。原來在南重慶路口泰山路上新開一家大豐紙號，寬大的二樓　有免費閱覽室，陳列各種最新出版的書報雜誌及萬有文摩等參考書，公開任人閱讀，並備有無綫電，時而放送一陣輕悠的音樂，調節讀者的身心，倦勞的人們，渴求精神食糧的青年們大可到那裏去安閑片刻。我覺得那裏眞是悲惡濁的都市裏一個清靜的角落，現在特地把他寫出來，一以感謝大豐的賢明局能有這種新設施，一以介紹給諸位讀者共同去享受片刻。（奚誠）</p>

<h3>A Visit with General Yamashita, Supreme Commander of the Army on Leyte Island</h3>
<p>On the narrow ground of Leyte Island, which is less than forty square miles, a bloody battle for the fate of Japan and the United States is continuing. Even at this moment, who knows how many loyal soldiers are waving their bayonets, assaulting enemy positions? Everything is determined between the clash of force and force. On December 6th, the reporter visited General Yamashita Tomoyuki, Supreme Commander of the Army on Leyte Island, at the military headquarters, and was very pleased to hear General Yamashita's confident remarks. The headquarters was a simple hut facing a row of high-powered machines. Under a large screen window, General Yamashita sat at his desk, reviewing official documents. Naturally, it was impossible not to feel quite nervous when visiting this imposing general. General Yamashita seemed to have seen the reporter's thoughts and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Don't you smoke?" His desk was piled with maps of Leyte. Looking at these grounds, General Yamashita was perhaps thinking about how to annihilate the American troops.</p>
<p>"Leyte is always an island!" He didn't seem to like smoking very much, he only urged the reporter to smoke, but he didn't touch it himself, watching the reporter smoke with satisfaction, and suddenly said this sentence. His meaning can be guessed as saying, "Supply is very important!" Then, he continued, as if afraid of being questioned:</p>
<p>"But, for example, when you go to Kyushu, you have to take a ship after taking the train. It's the same when you go to Marseille. In short, the distance may be long or short, but the procedures are always the same. That's the reason."</p>
<p>"The enemy is publicizing a lot, not only in Leyte, but also landing on Ramon Bay in Luzon Island."</p>
<p>"If they really come to Ramon Bay, then we should thank God, because in that case, we can fight without crossing the sea! Ha, ha, ha..."</p>
<p>Three fighter planes flew neatly in formation over the treetops. General Yamashita seemed to see the reporter's little nervous reaction.</p>
<p>"Those are friendly planes! Where is your hometown? What, Fukuoka? Fukuoka has many heroes?"</p>
<p>Then, the reporter listened attentively to the general expounding on the grand theory of not being timid about ordinary things.</p>
<p>"Where is the general from?"</p>
<p>"Me? I'm a playboy from Kyoto! Can't you tell? Haha, ha..."</p>
<p>Speaking of being a nobleman, he really is a nobleman, and he is also from Tosa.</p>
<p>"However, I am now considered a Tokyoite. The American devils come to bomb Tokyo, which is really hateful. We must take revenge on Leyte!"</p>
<p>"As long as the supply is good, we can be sure of victory."</p>
<p>"However, while we say it's good, the other side is also very good, and this must be known. From now on, Leyte will be rainy, and the soldiers will really suffer, but I hope it won't be in vain."</p>
<p>General Yamashita has become fatter this year than before. His belly is sticking out even more. He is very healthy and in good spirits. The reporter's purpose of visiting had been achieved, so he said goodbye immediately and wished him well.</p>
<p>"Your complexion is not very good, are you not feeling well somewhere?" the general asked kindly.</p>
<p>Indeed, the reporter had suffered from dengue fever a few days ago, with a fever as high as 39 degrees, and today he had come out despite his illness in order to meet the general.</p>
<p>"Oh, is it a headache or a stomachache?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, I see! Is your appetite not good? Then, eat this and you'll be fine immediately." He took out a bottle of stomach medicine from the inner room and said.</p>
<p>He treated the reporter so sincerely that he was extremely grateful. The reporter carefully put the stomach medicine in his bag and walked out of the headquarters.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops on Leyte Launch Fierce Attacks: Fierce Fighting in Coastal Areas: Powerful Japanese Air Force Launches Surprise Attacks on Enemy Airfields</h3>
<p>Philippines Front Line, Japanese Military Base, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Air Force launched a surprise attack on the Tacloban and Tolak airfields on Leyte Island with powerful forces on the night of the 23rd, inflicting considerable damage on the enemy and returning safely to base.</p>
<p>Philippines Front Line, Japanese Military Base, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese troops are currently seizing the Burauen and San Pablo airfields on the east coast of Leyte and fiercely attacking the Tolak enemy airfield, hindering the enemy's use. Fierce intrusion battles have been unfolding day and night in Chirosa (north of Tolak) in recent days. A unit of Japanese troops intruded into the enemy's newly built Tanoman airfield, seemingly causing heavy damage to the enemy's material warehouses. Enemy intelligence has also acknowledged these facts. Furthermore, Japanese troops have constructed strong defenses north of Ormoc and have been fiercely attacking enemy troops in the Leyte and Lobero coastal areas for days, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. An enemy unit was outflanked by the Japanese right wing on the 18th and attempted to intrude into Babatngon, but was also attacked fiercely by Japanese troops and repulsed. By the 19th, the enemy's will to fight had become increasingly low, and they have now retreated to the northwest of Ormoc.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The casualties among the US Army and Navy on Leyte Island are very high, and the need for blood for transfusions has also increased sharply. According to a United Press report from Pearl Harbor on the 23rd, the first shipment of blood for transfusions transported from the US Pacific coast to the Philippines by air route arrived at the rear hospital in Ormoc after several days. However, the hospital was filled with wounded soldiers, and the blood sent was completely used up in just seven days, and a request was made for three times the amount of blood to be sent quickly. Therefore, the Red Cross authorities on the Pacific coast must request assistance in supplying blood from San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Portland, and San Diego, which have traditionally provided blood.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee: Committee Chairman Determined</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Problem of Evacuating the Population of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Although the population of Shanghai has not been accurately counted, it is estimated to be around five million. It cannot be denied that such a large population supports the prosperity of Shanghai today. However, upon closer analysis, we cannot help but recognize that a terrible crisis lies hidden behind this prosperity. If we think about it a little more soberly, it is not difficult to feel like we are "walking on thin ice, as if facing a deep abyss." Recently, Shanghai's prices have fluctuated violently, led by the soaring price of rice, which can be described as unprecedented, seriously threatening seven or eight tenths of Shanghai's citizens. The municipal government authorities and relevant parties all regard this as a very serious problem and are taking effective countermeasures. In terms of law, it is appropriate to announce the application of the Special Criminal Law in Wartime to protect the safety of the people. In terms of food supply, considering the principle of prioritizing rice rationing, all of these are based on the impoverished strata, which account for seven or eight tenths of Shanghai's citizens, in order to adjust the current unreasonable phenomena. Can we be free from worry if we have an adequate and timely supply? No, we Chinese are one of the participating countries in the Greater East Asia War. Under the wartime phenomenon of prioritizing everything for military purposes, the people have an obligation to sacrifice the individual self to achieve the greater self in order to promote the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War. We cannot allow civilian needs to affect the importance of military needs. Moreover, as the war moves closer to the decisive stage, the demand for all materials to supply military needs is even more pressing, and the means of transporting materials are also prioritized for military needs. We must find ways to reduce consumption as much as possible, which is the duty of far-sighted Shanghai people today.</p>
<p>Reducing consumption as much as possible can be achieved through control and conservation. If all five million citizens of Shanghai can achieve ideal conservation, the consumption of five million citizens still needs to be transported from areas outside of Shanghai. The lack of materials and the difficulty of transportation have certainly caused the serious price increases of today, threatening livelihoods. Is this seriousness, this threat, not caused by the excessively large consumption of Shanghai's citizens? Therefore, truly suppressing prices, ensuring an adequate and timely supply, and reducing consumption still require evacuating the population of Shanghai, which is more thorough.</p>
<p>Secondly, after the southern residential area was bombed again by enemy American planes, innocent citizens were unfortunately killed and injured. From then on, the inhumane enemy American planes may continue to carry out cruel indiscriminate bombing. The air defense forces of the Allied garrisons are sufficient to suppress the enemy American planes' misguided actions, and the citizens have made all necessary preparations. However, we cannot be complacent. The enemy American planes' bombing, in addition to destroying production, mainly serves as a psychological warfare tactic, attempting to disrupt the morale of peaceful areas through inhumane indiscriminate bombing, as one of their tactics. The conditions for winning the war are material resources and manpower. After the victory, manpower will be especially important. For the sake of winning the war, we must preserve manpower and use it to increase production. For the sake of building a new China after the war, we must also preserve manpower. We cannot make manpower a meaningless sacrifice and must evacuate. The Allied powers' major cities in Japan have already evacuated their populations. Shanghai's population is so dense that evacuation is truly necessary.</p>
<p>We believe that many citizens are considering the issue of returning to their hometowns. The main difficulty lies in the inconvenience of transportation, which makes them hesitate and unable to decide. The objective need for evacuating the population has matured. The municipal government authorities need to plan thoroughly and properly and mobilize. However, we feel that evacuating the population must take into account:</p>
<p>First, mobilize the baojia people's organizations, hometown associations, and other organizations to form population evacuation committees. Adopt both voluntary evacuation and compulsory evacuation. At the same time, set up reception centers at each station along the way to give preferential treatment to those returning to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Second, provide absolute convenience or free travel in terms of transportation. Designate land and sea transportation vehicles specifically for evacuating the population. The limit on the amount of luggage allowed should not be too small. Specify the scope of luggage allowed. Inspection procedures must be simple, and extortion and other corruption must be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Third, evacuate the elderly, the weak, women, and children first. Hooligans who endanger public security, gold-diggers who disrupt society, and rentiers who only increase material consumption are all included in the evacuation.</p>
<h3>Key Points of Winter Rice Stem Borer Control: Local Authorities Should Implement Them Earnestly</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – In areas where rice crops have suffered from rice stem borer damage, list the key points for each mu of rice crop below for implementation:</p>
<p>(A) Dig up or pick up the larvae of the rice stem borer that have not yet pupated. The larvae are always inside the rice stalks. Therefore, in fields that have already been winter-tilled and planted with winter crops, the rice roots should be picked up and collected. In fields that have not been winter-tilled or are fallow, the rice roots should be picked up and collected. The rice roots collected above can be treated according to the following methods: (1) Pile the rice roots separately, allowing the rice stem borer to be affected by the dry weather and cold winter, causing them to rot and die. Or, pile the rice roots and river mud next to the field in layers to be used as fertilizer. (2) Mix the rice roots with dry firewood and pile them next to the field, burning them to be used as fertilizer. (3) In farm families with sufficient manpower, dig deep pits to bury the rice roots inside, waiting for them to rot and be used as fertilizer. (4) Or dry the rice roots in the sun to be used as firewood for the family.</p>
<p>(B) Implement winter tillage. Fallow land should be winter-tilled with a plow. After the rice roots are turned over, the cold weather will attack them, which will naturally kill the larvae.</p>
<p>(C) Irrigate fallow land. In rice paddies where rice stem borers are more severe and which are fallow, if irrigation is convenient, it is advisable to irrigate the fields in winter. The depth of the irrigation should be limited to submerging the rice roots. After fifty days, the larvae inside the rice roots will naturally rot and die.</p>
<p>(D) Build grass stacks. In areas where the two-brooded rice stem borer is found, if farm families have surplus rice straw that they plan to keep for use next spring, they should stack the rice roots inward, with the tips outward, surrounded by straw mats and reeds, and tie them tightly with ropes to confine the hatching rice stem borer moths from flying out to lay eggs, thereby cutting off their reproduction.</p>

<h3>Pope's Christmas Broadcast: Hopes for Lasting Peace: A Reasonable Organization Must Emerge After the War</h3>
<p>Vatican City, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - Pope Pius XII, in his Christmas address this year, expressed deep sorrow for the fires of war raging around the world. Regarding the relations between countries, he hoped that an organization would emerge after the war that would be sufficient to guarantee a reasonable peace for both the victors and the vanquished. The Pope said that this was the sixth time he had given a Christmas address during the war, and that hope arose from the darkness, hoping that this war could be the starting point for another new era. The Church does not participate in the forms of government, but it attaches great importance to whether the government cares about the public welfare. For example, although a civil political system is the principle of a republic, it is not impossible for it to exist in a monarchical country. The Pope continued, saying that the people and the masses are different. The masses are the tools of the government, while the people have their own position and understand their responsibilities. The Pope finally advocated for the permanent elimination of all wars of aggression. If an organization to maintain peace emerges, it must be able to treat everyone equally, without distinguishing between the victors and the vanquished, and must not give special privileges to any country.</p>
<h3>The Future of the German Nation: Filled with Infinite Glory: Goebbels Broadcast on Christmas Eve</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels broadcast the following to the nation on Christmas Eve: The past year has been an unprecedented year in German history. The German people have never faced such a fate. However, the German people have demonstrated a heroic attitude of resistance during this year. If the German people did not have such a tenacious spiritual strength, they would not be in the position they are today. I firmly believe that the future of the German people is filled with infinite glory. The current state and future of the war can prove that my beliefs are exceptionally correct. The German people's resistance and offensive capabilities have shocked and envied the enemy. The German people not only did not end their fate as the enemy predicted, but instead made them realize that the German people still have a great future. A week ago, the German army on the Western Front switched from defense to offense. Its vigorous spiritual strength and great combat power have been praised by the world. Everyone expresses admiration for this feat of the German soldiers. The German people vow to be by the side of Führer Hitler, praying for the Führer's well-being. At the same time, I convey to the German people that the Führer is enduring the hardships of war together with the people during Christmas. The Führer thinks about national affairs day and night. The enemy has spread rumors that the Führer is ill, but the Führer has always been healthy and in exceptionally good spirits. What the Führer wants to announce to the world is that at the appropriate time, he will let people hear the Führer's unwavering faith and determination. Looking at the future development of the war, the German army will use all good opportunities to give the enemy a big blow. In the past few weeks, the enemy has tried to alienate the Führer and the people. However, in the weeks before the launch of this new offensive on the Western Front, the Führer had been painstakingly planning for the future of the German people day and night. As soon as the opportunity arises, the war will have an appropriate answer.</p>

The meeting lasted only thirty minutes, and Chiang's attitude was extremely arrogant. Zhou Enlai has now returned to Yan'an.</p>
<h3>Greek Situation War Expands to the Northwest</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to an Athens dispatch: 20,000 troops of the ELAS (National Popular Liberation Army) recently broke into the base of the EDES (National Republican Greek League) guerrilla group in Ioannina, northwestern Greece. Since then, the Greek civil strife has finally spread throughout the country. British Commander Scobie issued a public statement on the 23rd, stating that ELAS's attack on EDES was a challenging act of violating the convention. From this, it can be seen that ELAS's response to the solution has not satisfied the British military. The aforementioned agreement refers to the agreement between ELAS and EDES before the British army landed in Greece.</p>
<p>Leftist Army Responds to British Surrender Request</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Reuter's News Agency reports: London yesterday announced the Greek rebel army's response to the British Commander General Scobie's request for surrender.

However, they request that the Greek troops recently transferred from the Middle East be withdrawn from Athens.

<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - It is reported that the British Commander in Greece, Scobie, responded to the ELAS group and is drafting a reply. In this reply, because the ELAS group rejects the British government's interference in Greek internal affairs, the British army will never recognize it. According to a Reuters dispatch from Athens, the hope of a Christmas truce has completely disappeared, and therefore the fighting in the city of Athens continues. The British Air Force has occupied both sides of the Acropolis and is said to have seized the gas company in Athens, but the central power plant in Athens is still in the hands of the ELAS organization.</p>

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Overview of Higher Education in the Capital</h3>
<p>— Min Xian</p>
<p>Education is the foundation of the nation's life and is extremely important. Regarding the situation of primary and secondary education in the peaceful areas, I have mentioned it in several previous travel correspondences. The general situation is that people who are wholeheartedly engaged in primary and secondary education feel that life is difficult and that there is a constant threat. In particular, there is an extreme lack of teachers, and it is inevitable that unqualified people are filling the positions. I repeatedly mention this, no matter how tedious, in the hope of attracting the attention of the authorities. Now, based on what I have observed on the ground, I will talk about higher education in the capital, which I think those who care about education will also be happy to hear about. The general situation of the Central University, the highest institution of learning, has already been mentioned in the "Petty Notes from Nanjing" published in this newspaper the other day, so there is no need to repeat it. What I am talking about now are the only three private universities in Nanjing - China Public School, Jiancun Agricultural College, and Southern University - but strictly speaking, apart from China Public School, which has three colleges of liberal arts, law, and commerce and has the form of a university, the other two schools only have two colleges or even one college, but what is taught are all university courses, and it can be said that they are independent colleges within the university. Therefore, they are collectively referred to as higher education. Moreover, these three schools each have their own characteristics and their own spirit, and they are worth introducing in an article. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Autonomous China Public School</p>
<p>First there were students, then there was a school. The founding of China Public School opened a new era in the history of education in our country. There are many inspiring deeds left in the world, such as the founder, Mr. Yao Hongye, who even committed suicide to promote the establishment of the school. His will is still preserved and regarded as the school motto for commemoration. Later, talented people emerged in large numbers and made many contributions in academic circles and other fields. For example, Hu Shih and Ren Hongjun, as well as several martyrs of the Huanghuagang Uprising, all came from this school. After arduous management, the scale gradually took shape. Before the incident, there was a large campus in Wusong with all academic equipment. Unfortunately, it was completely destroyed by the war, which was a great loss to the academic community. After the national government returned to Nanjing, graduates of the school, Xu Xun, Gong Longyingjie, Zheng Yaqiu, and others, happened to be in Nanjing. Based on the consistent spirit of student autonomy, they advocated the restoration of the school, which was announced in the summer of the 31st year. The current principal is Jian Jianwu, and the vice-principal is Long Yingjie. The school building is the former site of the Legislative Yuan. Before the military coup, the interior was quite prosperous with pavilions and buildings. Sympathizers even said that the Grand View Garden was there. Most of it was destroyed by artillery fire in the 26th year. Now it has been repaired and barely serves as a classroom. There are three departments of liberal arts, law, and commerce, with more than 300 students. The curriculum is quite serious, and the academic level of the students is not bad. Every Sunday morning, there is a teacher-student discussion meeting, which is hosted by Vice President Long. Students can make suggestions and criticisms on any school issues, and they never betray the glorious spirit of the school's founding. As for the source of funds, in addition to a part of donations, the tuition fees collected from students each semester are really not enough to maintain the school. Long Yingjie frankly stated that several faculty members do other kinds of business to support the school, and absolutely do not want the school to support them. Their enthusiasm for education is admirable.</p>
<p>Practical Jiancun Agricultural College</p>
<p>Jiancun Agricultural College is a part of the China Work-Study Corps. The president is Dr. of Agriculture Tie Mingjun, and most of its funds are supported by Chairman Ding Mocun. The school is currently divided into three departments - Agricultural Education Department, Agronomy Department, and Horticulture Department - with a total of more than 100 students, including 9 female students. The curriculum is absolutely serious, with particular emphasis on on-site verification. The usual practice of winter and summer vacations is canceled to avoid wasting time. The professors include Tong Yumin, Gu Xinmei, Shen Fu, Wang Linong, Tang Mingxin, and others, all of whom are prominent figures in the agricultural field in China. Students' food and lodging are completely free. The uniforms of teachers, students, and staff are all the same style. They eat at the same table and live in the same dormitory, without any distinction. It is like a large family in a rural village. When the reporter visited, he saw male and female students working in the fields in the specimen area and vegetable breeding area near the school, hoeing, carrying dung, leveling the ground, and watering, with full spirits and amiable attitudes, which was admirable. Moreover, the students are all physically strong and have rosy complexions, which shows that regular work and exercise are very beneficial to the body. It is said that the cooking and cleaning in the school are all managed by the students themselves, and the school only hires one gatekeeper. This kind of practical spirit from top to bottom is a major feature of the school. In the revitalization of rural areas and the increase of production, the students of this school are reliable basic cadres. It is a pity that due to limited funds, all equipment and training cannot fully meet the ideal, and it is hoped that the government and society will strongly support it.</p>
<p>Convenient Southern University</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Kanghu founded Southern University, from Beijing to Shanghai, and from Shanghai to Nanjing. What are the results? The society has its own evaluation, and there is no need for reporters to say anything more. However, Mr. Jiang's consistent spirit of running the school is admirable. After Southern University moved to Nanjing, it set up two colleges of liberal arts and law, with a total of 300 male and female students. The Dean of the College of Liberal Arts is Cai Dingcheng, and the Dean of the College of Law is Chen Yantong. In order to accommodate general working men and women, classes are all held in the evening, so it may as well be called a night university. In addition to male and female civil servants and various employees, there are also several monks who are free from earthly desires. It is said that the curriculum is good and the spirit is also good, and it is convenient for everyone. (Sent from Nanjing)</p>

<h3>City Financial Institutions Finance Department Decides to Stabilize Unsound Financial Institutions Will Have Appropriate Measures</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai financial industry as a whole was strengthened after the Ministry of Finance issued its guidelines, it has gradually become stable. The financial institutions with strong capital and a long history have become increasingly solid in their operations. Financial institutions with weak capital, which in the past specialized in speculative hoarding or indiscriminately making loans, have been severely hit and are gradually being eliminated. Recently, as the end of the year is approaching, various parties are handling final accounts, and the deadline for the authorities to strengthen financial institutions is approaching. Occasionally, several banks and firms that are unable to strengthen their business institutions are shaken or preparing to handle liquidation matters. The general public who do not understand the facts have created misinformation and rumors, which have a significant impact on the protection of the assets of merchants and people. In order to understand the truth, the Central News Agency reporter went to the authoritative source of financial institutions. According to reports, the Ministry of Finance authorities, in view of the abnormal prosperity of Shanghai's financial institutions in the past two years, and the emergence of newly established banks and money houses like bamboo shoots after rain, the Central Reserve Bank's Financial Affairs Inspection Office has been conducting strict inspections in recent years. Among them, there are many who abide by the provisions of the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions promulgated by the government and engage in legitimate business operations. However, there are also not a few who do not meet the statutory provisions on assets and liabilities, and use the funds attracted by deposits to secretly engage in speculative business, or hoard materials and indiscriminately make loans. This situation not only disrupts the stability of finance, but also stimulates the rise in prices. If there is a reaction in prices or a failure in speculation, it will hinder the protection of the assets of merchants and people. Therefore, in order to stabilize Shanghai's finance, suppress prices, and protect the safety of the assets of merchants and people, the Ministry of Finance has to strengthen financial institutions, consolidate the business foundation, and implement strict measures to increase capital amounts, inspect assets and liabilities, and restrict deposits and loans. Since the implementation of this strengthening policy, all financial institutions have complied with the law and fulfilled their obligations. Among them, financial institutions that cannot meet the total limit of deposits absorbed and are unable to increase their capital will inevitably shut down automatically, or will be merged and reorganized to continue to maintain their business. It is now heard that the Ministry of Finance authorities have taken appropriate measures for these unsound financial institutions and decided to resolve them in a proper way. On the one hand, they will be considerate of the difficult business of financial institutions, and at the same time, they will absolutely safeguard the assets of merchants and people without being affected in the slightest, so that financial institutions in Shanghai can maintain stability during this process.</p>
<h3>Police Department Extends Registration of Social Organizations to the End of the Year Those Who Do Not Register Will Be Strictly Ordered to Disband</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Department previously received another part of the misunderstanding of the authorities' intentions, thinking that this registration was to reorganize the group or impose unnecessary interference, so there was a tendency to hesitate and delay. The bureau has always implemented registration with the main goal of maintaining security. If any staff member uses registration to add improper interference or demand money, they will be severely punished. This registration is necessary for all groups, whether they are registered groups in the old concession era, those who are registered with other agencies such as the National Government and the Municipal Government, those supported by the Municipal Government, or semi-official and semi-private groups. Please do not misunderstand. If there are still those who do not register within the aforementioned period, they will be strictly ordered to disband in accordance with the regulations. This is to remind all groups to pay attention.</p>
<h3>District Procuratorate Improves Treatment of Juvenile Offenders</h3>
<p>In order to improve the treatment of juvenile offenders and expedite the conclusion of cases, the Shanghai District Procuratorate has specially formulated improvement measures. If the juvenile offender has family members, they will be sent to their family members at any time for strict supervision and education. Juvenile offenders without family members will be sent to the Shanghai District Court for quality security measures. It is heard that the procuratorate has instructed all its procurators to earnestly comply with it.</p>
<h3>Baojia Office Urges Payment of Baojia Fees</h3>
<p>The Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Department has been collecting Baojia funds uniformly since July of this year. Now, for the combined collection of Baojia funds for September and October of this year, some districts have not yet paid them. The Baojia Office authorities will inform the chief Lianbao of each district to pay them to the office's accounting office. In addition, in order to adjust the collection of Baojia funds, the office will make adjustments starting from January of the 34th year of the Republic of China and is currently drafting a plan.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Investigates Number of Draft Cattle</h3>
<p>The Economic Bureau's Production Increase Section believes that the productivity of rural areas this year is less than in previous years. According to an investigation by the section, the sole reason for the economic bankruptcy of rural areas in the four townships is that the main farm tools are adhering to old methods and technology cannot be improved. The lack of draft cattle, manpower, and material resources makes progress slow, so the promotion of production increase work has limited results. Moreover, this year the central government has designated it as a year of production increase, and promoting winter plowing is one of the main tasks for preparing for next year's production increase. In view of this, the bureau has begun to formulate an investigation into the number of draft cattle in each county in order to find ways to assist farmers, so that the production increase work can be smoothly promoted.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Was the Yunnan Uprising Day Municipal Government Held Commemorative Ceremony</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 25th) was the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. The Municipal Government held a memorial ceremony in the Municipal Government Auditorium on Jiangxi Road at 10:00 am. The chiefs and senior officials of various bureaus and offices in the city attended. Chief Secretary Sun Lifu represented Secretary-General Wu to report on the significance of the Yunnan Uprising. The ceremony ended at 10:30 am.</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 25th) was the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. In addition to specially sending Chief of Staff Yu Shijie, Chief of General Affairs Zhang Yingkui, Chief Secretary Wu Nong, Section Chief of the Rural Pacification Affairs Bureau Shen Zhicai, and Chief of the Blockade Management Office Suo, and others to the Municipal Government to participate in the commemorative meeting, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters also convened all officers in the headquarters auditorium at 9:00 am to hold a commemorative ceremony. Chief of Staff Xiong Jiandong presided over the meeting. In addition to explaining the revolutionary spirit and deeds of the martyrs of that day, he earnestly exhorted his subordinates that during the decisive battle in this big city, they must continue the martial spirit of the martyrs and work together to bring this arduous mission to fruition.</p>
<h3>Each District Baojia Should Establish Air Defense Work Teams To Assist in the Rescue of Air Raid Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>According to a spokesman for the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, the "Belated Chongqing-bound US enemy planes are attempting to disturb the people's hearts in the rear and disrupt public order. They have repeatedly invaded Shanghai and indiscriminately bombed civilian residential areas, causing innocent people to suffer tragically. This is extremely infuriating. In addition to expressing our deep sympathy to the victims of the disaster and trying to provide relief, the authorities hope that the citizens will intensify their air defense equipment and various air defense measures so that the air defense camp can be strengthened. At the same time, each district Baojia air defense organization should establish work teams, select excellent members, and serve with a sincere spirit. Once an unfortunate air raid occurs, all must be dispatched to assist. The actual workers in the disaster areas attacked in the past were very lacking, which made it impossible to quickly rescue all the injured refugees. Therefore, it is increasingly necessary to increase the number of air defense team members."</p>
<h3>Seaman Training Center Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>The 12th term of recruits from the Central Seaman Training Center and the 2nd term of student seamen from the Central Merchant Ship Ordinary Seaman Training Center have all been recruited and are scheduled to hold an opening ceremony at the school on Bansongyuan Road in Nanshi at 10:00 am on the 29th of this month.

<h3>Director-General of Incense and Candle Tax Bureau Announces Administrative Policy</h3>
<p>The post of Director-General of the Incense and Candle Tax Bureau of the National Government Ministry of Finance has been filled by Zhang Haoran, the Director-General of the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Shanghai Foil Tax Bureau. Zhang arrived at the bureau yesterday to take office and announced his aspirations for promoting incense and candle tax administration in the future: "The incense and candle tax policy is one of the new taxes promulgated by the government, and all of them are to manage general incense and candle sales tax affairs, so as to enrich the national treasury. I will uphold the principles of the authorities and strive to implement them. In the past, in the incense and rice tax policy, the general merchants failed to follow the intentions of the authorities, which hindered the progress of tax collection. I will try my best to correct this point and hope that the merchants and people will cooperate so that it can be promoted smoothly."</p>

<h3>Emulating "Wu Xun" in Begging and Promoting Education: Donating Wealth and Upholding Righteousness brook No Delay</h3>
<p>In recent days, three cinemas in Shanghai have been showing "The Righteous Beggar." This film depicts the story of "Wu Xun" from Shandong in ancient times, who begged to establish schools. Many people must have seen it. I wonder what their thoughts were after watching it? "Wu Xun" was a beggar. Begging is the most difficult and detestable profession among the thirty-six trades. But how could he leave a fragrant legacy for generations to come? In simple terms, it was because he begged for money to set up schools, so that poor children in the locality could all seek knowledge. As the saying goes, "Ten years of growth, ten years of education." Others did not do it, but "Wu Xun" had a consistent spirit and did it consistently. Not only that, but he also had a unique style, which was that if people didn't give him money, he would kneel and refuse to leave. Students who didn't study hard in school would also kneel and refuse to leave. Therefore, people always gave him money. The school's funding was deeply affected by him. It can be said that his efforts were unique. A person like "Wu Xun" sacrificed his entire life's time and energy to seek welfare for poor children. It is truly a miracle of the ages! This newspaper has always appealed to all sectors to donate money when handling scholarships, and at the same time, guide students to make progress in their studies. This idea is somewhat similar to "Wu Xun." We are also willing to emulate the spirit of "Wu Xun," running around and appealing to all parties every day, hoping that the scholarship movement can be successful. Then, we should know to rise up and help students, which is the urgent task at hand. Please ask people to support our "Wu Xun spirit"!</p>
<p>John's Students Collectively Help Students</p>
<p>This newspaper advocated a few days ago that helping students must exert the power of "collectivity," and hoped that all schools, from junior high school onwards, would at least recognize and assist one team, meaning that students with money should help students without resources, just like righteous brothers in distress, helping each other like lips and teeth. This is a meaningful task. Sure enough, many schools have responded to the call. Yesterday, students from the Education Department and the Civil Engineering College of St. John's University cooperated to form as many as seven teams, and Professors Yang Kuanlin and Chuan Tongxian took the lead in initiating the movement. All the students unanimously agreed, and the funding for the seven teams was immediately raised. Everyone's enthusiasm is very touching. It is said that students from other departments also have the motivation to continue raising funds, and there are probably several more teams that can be recognized. Originally, among the students who can enter university, although many of their families are poor and impoverished, there are also not a few children from middle-class or wealthy merchants. As long as they have a kind thought and everyone helps poor students, the accumulated results will be very impressive. A university with hundreds or thousands of students can easily recognize ten or twenty teams "collectively." It depends on human effort. What is so difficult about it? May the university students take the lead, and may all schools follow suit. How fortunate, how hopeful.</p>
<p>Dong Xiaoding's Charity Photography Exhibition</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao Ding has been fascinated by art since childhood. For several years, he has specialized in patterns and Western painting at the Shanghai Art College, and has gained considerable experience and excellent results. In his spare time, he has also devoted himself to the study of photography. Now he plans to select more than 70 of his best and most artistic works, enlarge them separately, and match them with beautiful frames. The photography charity exhibition will be held at the YMCA Library in Ba Xian Qiao from January 1st to 4th of the New Year. All the proceeds from the sale, after deducting the cost, will be donated to the scholarship funds of the Shen Bao and Xin Shen Bao. His enthusiasm is commendable, and there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Scholarship Receipts: Wang Kesan 4,000 yuan, Sun Yuji 2,000 yuan, Zhang Jinxing 800 yuan, Wu Cuizhen and Wei Jianying 500 yuan each, Pu Jiting 100 yuan, totaling 7,900 yuan in savings certificates, with a balance of 7,035,023 yuan.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Petitioning on Behalf of More Than 4,000 Students</h3>
<p>Under the enthusiastic guidance and encouragement of our readers, this newspaper has been handling scholarship matters for seven sessions. The number of students and the amount of scholarships have been increasing session by session. On the one hand, this shows the urgent need for assistance among young students, and on the other hand, it shows the love of our readers for young people and their enthusiasm for education.</p>
<p>Based on the number of students who received assistance in the previous session and the forecast of the increase in tuition fees for the next semester, this newspaper has set the fundraising target for this session at 20 million yuan, which is really a minimum number. The recent rise in prices has made us deeply feel that this 20 million yuan is really not enough. According to the current social and economic situation, the number of students requesting scholarships next semester may be twice that of the previous session, and the increase in school tuition fees may be three or four times. How to ensure that the more than 4,000 students who receive scholarships from this newspaper can continue their studies is a matter that really makes our colleagues anxious, unable to sleep or eat, and constantly worried about.</p>
<p>However, every time we think back to the enthusiasm of our readers for supporting and generously donating to the scholarship movement in previous sessions, we gain unlimited courage and confidence. We believe that due to the importance of the scholarship movement, as long as everyone works hard separately, it will not be difficult to achieve the expected goal. We believe that due to the past concern of our readers for young students, they will never bear to sit idly by and watch their studies be wasted, causing the flowers and trees that they have personally cultivated and irrigated for four years to wither and decay, and causing everyone to fall short of success and abandon all previous efforts.</p>
<p>The fundraising methods for this session have long been published in the newspaper, and we hope to complete the fundraising target of 20 million yuan within this month. Now, in the last week of the fundraising period we have set for the 33rd year of the Republic of China, we respectfully petition our readers with full enthusiasm for more than 4,000 lovely young people. We firmly believe that at this critical juncture, everyone will be able to make their greatest efforts to promote this most important and meaningful work in society.</p>

<p>The Salvation Army soup kitchen, under special contract with this office, began distributing soup at the original site at No. 180 Xiamen Road in the upper ten days of this month. Those who eat the soup can enter the factory to receive it at 9:00 a.m. every day with the soup voucher they receive. Also, in view of the fact that the price of rice has been increasing day by day, yellow millet produced in North China is immediately used to cook the soup. According to experts, this millet contains a lot of vitamins and is beneficial to those suffering from dampness and diabetes. In terms of nutrition, it is no less than eating rice. Since the beginning, a total of 2,498 servings of soup have been distributed.</p>
<p>The Zhong Jiao Daoyi Association on Nantong Road also started distributing soup on the 10th of this month, benefiting more than 500 poor people. Distribution is made at 4:00 p.m. every day, with each person receiving two cups of red bean porridge. The Bailinan Road and Dongchang Road branches are also distributing at the same time, and the staff are all volunteers. In addition, the Yangshupu Hudong Commune and the Ximen Buddhist Soup Kitchen have also been actively distributing soup as agreed upon by this office.</p>
<h3>Mingde Jiyi Association Distributes Wheat Cake Vouchers</h3>
<p>A letter from the Mingde Jiyi Association states: "Our association has started distributing wheat cakes from the 15th of this month. We are hereby sending 1,000 cake vouchers to be distributed to the poor people in succession. We plan to continue to send them in the future, to express our intention to relieve famine. We hereby send this letter accordingly, hoping that you will check and take care of it." (Note: It has been forwarded to various charities for distribution, and this office will not distribute it separately.)</p>
<h3>Donating to Childbirth Funds is of Great Virtue</h3>
<p>The childbirth assistance movement is the second service of this office. Pregnant women can apply for registration with this office one month before delivery.</p>
<p>For normal deliveries, midwives will be sent to deliver the baby at the time of labor. If there are difficult labor conditions, hospitalization will be allowed, and all expenses will be borne by this office.</p>
<p>The greatest virtue of heaven and earth is life. Donating to childbirth funds has the ultimate intention of protecting the mother and the child. It is hoped that all sectors will respond enthusiastically, and the virtue will be great.</p>
<h3>Benefiting the Poor and Sick</h3>
<p>Free Injury Clinic Vouchers: Mr. Tong Zongyi is skilled in injury medicine and is famous in the field. Jing Linzhendang has printed free injury clinic vouchers to be distributed to the poor and sick, and Mr. Tong enthusiastically undertakes the medical work. Previously, we received 50 copies from you, which have already been sent out. Now, we have received another 50 copies from you, which we will distribute on your behalf. Patients can obtain them from this office and be introduced to the clinic. After diagnosis, wound medicine and ointment can be given free of charge, but because medicinal materials are expensive, it must be limited to those who are truly poor and sick. Location: Lane 23, No. 124, south end of Tongfu Road, Weihaiwei Road. Time: 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., serious illnesses will be treated immediately.</p>
<p>Continuing to Send Cold Relief Ointment: The Shanghai Zhe Shao Hospital produces its own special cold relief ointment, which is applied to the throat and the two acupoints on the second spinal bone of the back, and is exceptionally effective in treating chronic coughs and whooping cough in children. Previously, we received 200 pieces from you, which have already been sent out. Now, we have received another 200 pieces from you, which we will distribute on your behalf.</p>
<p>Relieving Poverty by Giving Clothes: Mr. Pu Ting is always enthusiastic about public welfare and spares no effort. Previously, he donated a camel wool cotton robe to this office, which has been sold for charity, and the proceeds have been used for the poor. Another jacket, also donated by Mr. Pu, was given to the hidden poor, Mr. Sha. Mr. Pu is already hungry and drowning, and he relieves poverty by giving clothes, which is commendable.</p>
<h3>Introducing a Free Reading Room</h3>
<p>In these times of hunger and cold, most people are busy working for the high cost of rice and firewood. This is certainly the suffering that people living in a great era should experience. However, human beings are the spirit of all things. In addition to firewood, rice, oil, and salt, they also need considerable spiritual food. Especially young people, who have a strong desire for knowledge. Without books and newspapers to read, they will definitely feel extremely depressed. However, reading books and newspapers is not easy. Schools not only lack reference books, but even textbooks are not easy to prepare completely, not to mention periodicals. Fortunately, one time in the bleak and windy weather, I was pacing on Taishan Road (formerly Route Ghisi). Suddenly, I discovered an extremely good place, which really made me ecstatic at the time. It turned out that a Da Feng paper shop had just opened on Taishan Road at the intersection of South Chongqing Road. The spacious second floor has a free reading room, displaying all kinds of newly published books, newspapers, magazines, and Wanyou Wenmo and other reference books, which are open for anyone to read. It is also equipped with wireless electricity, which broadcasts a burst of light and leisurely music from time to time to adjust the readers' body and mind. Tired people and young people who are eager for spiritual food can go there to rest for a while. I feel that it is really a quiet corner in the tragic and turbid city. Now, I specifically write it out, first to thank Da Feng's wise bureau for having this new facility, and second to introduce it to all readers to enjoy a moment together. (Xi Cheng)</p>
<p>Introduction to New Book: Mr. Yang Zhongyi has been studying Zhuangzi with considerable experience. Now he is publishing his legacy, broadly collecting the legacy of the pre-Qin period, and writing the book "Xue Zhuang," which contains six chapters: Analysis of Zhuangzi's Views, Zhuangzi's Doctrines, Main Points of Zhuangxue, Evaluations of Various Schools, and Chapters of the Book. The whole book is printed on Lian Shi paper, totaling one hundred and several pages, priced at 300 yuan per volume, with proceeds donated to poverty relief. This office is selling it on consignment.</p>

<h3>Children's Welfare Association's Educational Work: Appealing to All Sectors to Cooperate in Promoting It</h3>
<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare Association currently maintains two educational institutions, which house more than 300 orphaned children. In terms of education, the association adopts the ordinary elementary school system. All courses strictly follow the standards promulgated by the Ministry, and actively promotes strict national education. In addition, in order to cultivate children's life skills, older children must participate in various labor training (such as shoe making, toothbrushes, gloves, sewing, laundry, planting, etc.) so that children can have a preliminary training opportunity before formally joining the vocational world. Education is mainly based on collective training, supplemented by individual training. Because the association accommodates children from all walks of life, with complex personalities and different backgrounds, in order to train these children to become healthy citizens, great efforts are devoted to guidance. In addition, the association also guides children to form self-governing groups, in order to cultivate children's self-governing ability and give play to children's self-governing spirit. In addition, in terms of care, attention is paid to children's clothing, food, and housing. Now, because material resources are difficult and food supply is lacking, each of the three meals a day consists of half white rice and half miscellaneous grains, supplemented with vegetables. Children's clothing also makes as much use as possible of old clothes, and in order to save money, all kinds of miscellaneous tasks such as cooking, washing, sweeping, hairdressing, and repairs are handled by teachers and staff supervising the children to take care of themselves, in order to cultivate children's habits of diligence and hard work. At the same time, children are encouraged to engage in appropriate sports and various competitions are promoted, in order to achieve the effect of exercise and reverse the drain of nutrition. In addition, the association also pays great attention to children's individual hygiene and public hygiene. Doctors and nurses are hired to regularly conduct physical examinations, vaccinate against smallpox, and inject cholera and typhoid fever prevention needles, in order to prevent problems before they occur.</p>
<p>The above briefly describes the association's educational work. In view of the fact that the times are becoming more difficult and material resources are scarce, it is truly difficult to maintain the minimum education of these orphaned children, and we rely on enthusiastic gentlemen and ladies from all walks of life to generously donate and contribute, so that the hundreds of helpless children of the association can continue their studies and regain their vitality. How fortunate, how fortunate!</p>
