<h3>人事健全和職權統一　米統會成功的先決條件</h3>
<p>這次米糧統制委員會召開幹部聯席會議，分發出席會員，我們隨手檢閱，認為帙，分發出席會員，我們隨手檢閱，認為提案偏於枝節瑣事；報吿無非努力之成就與困難之克服。昨天社評，我們特別提出「說老實話」，貢獻與會諸君，可是，閱了提案與報告，一方而感覺與會諸君在短短的三數大內，僅僅詳謮此十數萬言的報吿提案，事實上已恐難盡，　論研究提案與檢討報吿了。一方面對於提案和報吿仍有表面文章之感。其結果則提案通過表決報告束之行篋而已，與尋常會議，初無不同之處。由此以觀，憑藉這種報告和建議，而產生的今後業務方針，其明朗程度，能不令人憂疑？</p>
<p>然而，米糧統制間題畢竟是最主要的民生問題。米糧統制事業，辦理成功和失敗，在目前旣是民生改善的關鍵，又與戰爭勝利有唇齒密切的關係。所以，在米統會當局以至全體工作人員，都負有直接責任，而社會公衆也負有督策　贊的義務。我們與論界的建言督勵，更屬責無旁貸。對於過去該會工作，雖未饜人民期望，而對於未來，我們誠心誠意求其切實改善，因期望之殷，不覺言之率眞。常然，我們絕無成見，有之，也不過希望切切實實的改善。茲更重複提出我們前所主張的人事健全與職權統一兩點，以為米糧統制能否改善的先決條件：</p>
<p>第一，人事必須健全。嚴格　飭人事，仍為該會首要之急務。該會一切業務，動輒與「利」字有莫大因緣。過去聽到的作弊和巧取消息，令人氣沮。譬如採辦商人繳付保證金取得採辦資格後，即可向銀行借貸鉅數採辦資金，待米糧採辦以後，並不直接解繳米統會，而問接以黑市脫售，以圖獲取採辦官價與黑市之差額，厚肥私囊。一面將銀行貸款歸還，而以無從採辦託詞搪塞。至此，採辦商人私囊已肥，米統會則無米運用，而受黑市剝削者唯有人民大衆。又如米統會裝米所需蔴袋數量極鉅，開有一部分蔴袋購進後因破爛而無法使用，經手人中飽，而米統會則損失不貲，也就是人民大衆的損失不貲。諸如此類的弊竇，都是米統會人事不健全的表微，人事健全，是推進事業正常發展的動力。欲期事業發展，必以人事是否健全為前提。而人事健全的內容，就是用人唯才，注意甄別，如有舞弊，不徇私情，嚴加懲處。賞罰如不嚴明，則人事制度永速不會鍵全。</p>
<p>第二，職權必須統一。米糧統制委員會旣係担負整僩統制使命，則採辦儲運興配給應當都由該會統籌辦理，以一事權，以專責成。不但如此，間時，對於增加米糧生產，也應協同促成。聞某某產米區等因收買價格低於成本，並對農民施以種種强制手段，使農民視種米為畏途，非但不增產，反而抑低生產。同時，農民為防止低價收買，寗將產米暗中釀酒或製糖，而逃避收買。此種事實，更不容忽視。</p>
<p>人事健全與職權統一，實是一而二，二而一的。惟有人事健全了，才能取得各方而的信任，而促成職權統一。也惟有人事健全了，則職權統一，才可以充分運用。否則徒有統一的職權，益見案亂而已。</p>
<h3>緬邊境戰事順利　日軍緊縮包圍陣　英第七軍主力退路被遮斷</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電據緬甸前綫日軍某基地電，央第七師主力數千名自其退路全被遮斷，而竄人馬猶山脈東側某地後，刻仍以中口徑大砲及野砲，裝甲車數百輛，職重汽車數百輛，作最後頑抗。然日軍各精說部隊，已完成東西約四公里，南北約一公里之包　網，並自十二日以來，空陸相呼應，展開壯烈之殲減戰，刻正近迫拼命反擊之敵，故敵被全滅抑係投降，已成時間間題。又幸免被包圍之敵一部，已紛紛潰散徘徊於馬猶河至馬猶山麓之間，然刻亦因日軍掃蕩隊之追擎，已逃亡無路，多陸續投降。同時，佔領某地後之日軍某部隊，與突破馬猶山險進抵某國區之日軍某部隊呼應，已開始向某方進擎。又佔領頓古巴扎之日軍某部隊之一部，已開始向某方進擎，戰况正順利進展中。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電據南部印緬國境前綫日軍某基地電，數千英印將士，自被日軍於其背後切斷退路後，即極力利用所有之數百戰車，數百載重汽車迅帶轉向馬猶山　移動，且作猛烈之掩護射擊，企圖向納蓋德庫方面（該地位於唯一橫斷馬猶山險之公路上）逃脫，但日軍早料及此乃派清銳部隊於該方等待，及敵至時，即迎頭痛擊，使其陷於大混亂。十二日晨，日軍包　陣更極度壓縮，蒙特巴　將軍誇稱裝備最優之英第七師，刻已被迫緊處於東西四公里，南北一公里之袋中，奔走無路，徒自左右盤旋，料不出數日即當遭逢殲減之命運。又近與日軍協刀作戰之印國民軍甚為活躍，已予敵方印軍以莫大反響，故前來投效之印兵，日達數百，英印軍中之動搖，已如火燎原，行見阿拉坎將成為印度總倔起之發火點。</p>
<h3>日軍先發制人　意義實重大　已佔領要衝頓古巴扎</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電據緬甸前綫日軍某基地電，印緬邊境日軍，發動先發制人之攻勢後，瞬即佔領要衝頓古巴扎。按該地為自罵猶河上流沿那金河岸之敵軍重鎭，為橫斷馬猶山脈，通過那北安央及古巴扎路綫之軍需集積地，且復為空軍基地，故亦為攪亂日軍之據點。又那基安央爲由孟多經波利巴扎至印度之交通要道，又自孟多至布其頓之輸血路，亦以此地為中心，是故該地於奪回緬甸作戰上賞屬重要地位，敵人狂呼已久，擬俟一切準備完畢，即開始進攻。及至雨季過後，更於各基地集結兵力，以那基安央及古巴扎為前進據點，以那夫河至那金河為補給綫，而展開由一基地至另一基地之侵略戰，圖奪回孟多及布其頓地區後，再漸次壓迫阿恰布。然日軍開始攻擊後僅三十小時，即佔領那基安央，六日間又佔領頓古巴扎，同時將堆積於該兩地之大批軍需悉數鹵獲，致進出於孟多布其頓方面敵軍之北方退路及補給綫即形喪失，布其頓前方之英軍第七師，遂於某地區為日軍包圍，而遭被殲減之命運，由是敵軍之作戰計劃，乃由根本崩潰。按是役之初，倘日軍由正面攻擊該兩地，則收效必輕微，是故日軍改變戰術，出以奇襲，而將該兩地佔有，故此項作戰實具重大意義。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電緬句某基地電，緬甸方而日陸軍轟炸機隊，十四日夜半利用月夜進襲孟多，對準敵軍密集部隊，投下大量炸彈，予以重創。敵軍集合之車輛及數所軍需集結地，均被炸成為大火，日機全部返防。繼又派遺戰鬥機隊編隊進攻辛澤瓦，與挑戰之敵噴火式戰鬥機二十架展開猛烈空戰，瞬即擊落噴火敵機九架，此役日軍亦犧牲一架。</p>
<h3>印度國民軍　士氣旺盛</h3>
<p>仰光十六日中央社電緬甸前綫基地電自由印度國民軍此次活躍於戰綫上，具深長意義，屯駐於布其頓北方正面由蒙特巴頓所指揮之印兵一部刻已投降，是故印度國民軍士氣極為旺盛。現正緊迫由馬猶山脈向西潰退之敵，為爭取祖國之獨立，而英勇奮鬥，因之鮑斯氏以武力完成印度獨立之理想，在罵猶半島之殲減戰中，已充分表現其實現之端倪，敵人之勢窮力空，亦於此畢露矣。</p>
<h3>法院對民刑案件　不得積壓延擱　張司法部長誥誡所屬</h3>
<p>中央社訊司法行政部長張一鵬氏，自長部政以來對於我國司法，華劃不遺餘力更諄諄誡僚屬。近又為刑事案件偵查審判期限，及考核勤惰防止積案，特頒發手令，向僚屬指示，茲將原文分誌如下：「查刑事案件偵查審判期限，刑事訴訟審限規則，規定綦嚴，原所以考核勤情，防止積案，歷經通令飭運花案。乃查近來各級院署辦案人員，間有視為具文，致發生久屬不予審結，或受理延不傳訊情事。遂至弊竇叢生，人言嘖嘖，殊屬不成事體。要知訟累旣足以病民，抑　有損司法威信。為此令仰轉飭所屬遵照，嗣後配受案件，務須隨時傅訊。其有人犯　押者，尤應速辦速結，毋得稍有延擱。各該主管長官，均應深體斯旨，加以注意，從嚴督促。如再發現有上述情事，定即分別情飾，依法懲處，仰各凜遵毋遠」。</p>
<p>民事部份此外對民事案件，亦關懷殷切，並特頒發手令，誥誠僚屬，茲將原文錄下：一查民事案件，頭緒紛繁，審理固貴精詳，斷結尤須敏捷。法院多一日之稽延。即人民多一日之拖累。是以本部前以高地各院辦案　滯，未結之件，延擱至年餘之久，傳訊至七八次之多，猶未予終結者考之表冊，為數不少。會於上年一月二十三日，以民訓癸字第九七號，通令對於該積壓之民事案件，統限於三個月內妥速辦結，飾遵有案。乃近閱上年各法院呈報表冊，僅武昌地院三十二年底全數淸結，一無積壓。又湖北高院年終未結案件，只有八件外，其餘各高地院積案不多者，實居少數。尤其上海地院，據報至上年八月止，積案有一千一百七十三件；浙江高院，據報至上年十月止，積案有二百零三件，江蘇高院，據報至十一月止，積案有一百五十六件。此外各地院分庭，以及兼理司法之縣政府，接月案件。多不能收結相抵，一年或半年以上未結之案，數見不鮮。查民事通常案件，自受理之翌日起，已逾三個月，尙未辦結者，依照月報表填載辦法，即為遲延案件。就職責言之，實所不應，縱使在前或因人員更調而輒生缺額，或國機關改併而多所更張，遂致積案繁多，因而擱置。而在人民方面，久稽不决，責屬痛苦切膚。本部長為淸訟便民起見，用特重申前令，凡有積壓之件，務宜從速設法淸釐，萬勿長此因循，致招閭閭之怨對。各該高院長負有監督之責，應予隨時督促，俾從前積擱之習，一掃而空。如其承辦人員，仍有任意延誤情事，不妨據實揭參，以便移付懲戒。本部將以此為黜陟之淮繩，絕不稍予寬假，其各慎之。合行令仰遵照，並轉飭所屬，一體遵照辦理，此令。」</p>
<h3>日滿互派　興亞使節</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電滿洲協和會將於三月一日滿洲建國十二週年紀念日，前後派遺興農大臣黃富俄氏為訪日興亞使節，幷决在日本各地召開講演會。頃日大政翼贊會興亞總本部為答禮計，决派遺該會顧問永井柳太郎為答禮興亞使節，刻正進行一切準備。當今太平洋戰局益趨重大之際，日滿兩國興亞運動將因之飛躍進展，兩國之連緊亦將急速强化，故此舉之意義洵屬重大。</p>
<h3>谷大使返京</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電日駐華谷大使，自十四日以來，曾偕中村海軍武官，小川調查官石黑書記官等，前赴漢口方面視察，茲已於十六日返抵南京。日大使館情報部，並於是日下午三時，發表稱，谷大使為視察漢口方面情形，於十四日出發。在該地與中日軍政官民首腦部懇談，並赴現地視察實况後，十六日歸返。</p>
<h3>泰政府機關　決定疏散</h3>
<p>盤谷十六日中央社電泰國政府十五日夜以無綫當發表：謂鑒於决戰下現狀，决疏散政府機關。頃已選定伐琴布里縣及皮鼓遜卡姆縣附近希麓科拉克山脈中之某處，為設置政府中樞機關之所在，並命安東警察總監督工。</p>

<h3>妄自抬高物價者　政府決嚴厲制裁　實業部負責人昨發表談話</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電邇來各地物價暴漲，超逾限價數倍以上，以致人心杌隍不安，若長此以往，實有礙民生安定，與夫社會秩序之安謐。記者為欲明瞭當局對此嚴重問題，措置對策，特趨訪實業部負責人員，叩詢將以何種對策，以謀合理解决，而安定民生，維護戰時經濟體制。據談：該部早鑒於此，刻正在積極籌劃，以謀合理解决。除即派員分赴各省市調查實地狀况，並令飭各省市當局，嚴厲切實遵行物價管理暫行條例外，同時對來源方面，竭力疎暢，且使配給辦法，更求其進一步之合理圖滑，而對囤積居奇者，亦决不予以姑容忽視。妄自抬高價格者，亦將予以嚴厲制裁，務使物價平衡，民生安定。</p>
<h3>海關燈船流星號　遭美飛機盲炸　日記者追述經過情形</h3>
<p>中央社訊日駐華艦隊報這部派遺記者大塲氏，曾搭乘日海軍軍艦〇〇號，與日海軍將士同活躍於中國南海方面。據大塲氏由該方面來電，述及上月二十四日，美機盲目轟炸毫無武裝配備之中國海關燈　船流星號，並以機槍掃射，致使飄浮於海面之中國人二十餘人不救，以及日軍義使營救等情形。</p>
<p>大意謂：一月二十四日，美駐淪美空軍北B52式飛機，曾出現於南海，對中國海關燈　船加以盲目轟炸，因而遭難之中國人甚多，皆實為我人所不能忘煮。二十三日，南海風速為三十米左右，巨浪滔天，五口人所乘之軍艦〇〇號，亦於二十三日長由〇〇港出發，向某地北上。約航駛〇時間，僅前進〇公里，當時航行情形殊多危險。後奉艦長命令，遂回〇〇港。翌晨風浪稍緩，繼續北上，遂於二十四日中午，在〇〇灣附近停船。當拋鎭未久，忽接敵機襲擊流星號之電報。吾人聞此，不禁呆然。瞬即吾人均燃起討伐美空軍，及為該船復仇之戰　心。本艦同時即準備戰鬭，雖俟甚久，當日亦未發見其踪跡。</p>
<p>入夜後，春　滿繞，〇〇灣內成乳白色。當日敵空軍曾以飛機五架之編隊，襲整全無防備之漁村〇〇島，低空飛行達五十米左右，以機槍掃射。繼又沿烏北上遇流星號南下，供給〇〇島燈台物資。船身漆白色，且毫無一武裝，當不堪敵機一擊。該船中彈，瞬即傾覆冒烟，營救乏術。華人船員對美空軍此等暴虐不法行爲，無不痛恨人骨，咬牙切齒。當時南海風浪極大，船員跳入水後。浮於海面。然美機仍不肯飛去，待船沉後，於上空仍以機槍掃射飄浮海面之華籍船員。</p>
<p>本艦當夜奉命救助乘帆船抵達〇〇島之遭難者。當本艦抵〇〇島時，已將近天明，僅見里色島影。本艦以探海燈照射該鳥，艦上陸戰隊員改乘小船赴該島。當時寒風刺骨，登陸後遭難者各持一燈，各人之顏面表情均極緊張，口口聲聲述及美空軍暴虐行為。英美不僅虛構日軍虐待其俘虜，而本身則不法轟作日紅十字船，及中國海關燈台船。如重慶地方中國人目見同胞受美人之暴虐，果將作如何感想。</p>
<h3>日機爭襲　丹竹機塲</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　據日軍某基地十六日電，日軍機隊十三日下午五時半，會以戰鬥轟炸機聯合大編隊，急襲廣西省丹竹機塲，破壤其滑走路及軍事設施之一部。按該機塲最近敵曾計劃利用其為前進基地，想此次由於日機先發制人之轟炸，所受損失極大云。</p>
<h3>西南太平洋　戰鬥益激烈</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地訊：西南太平洋之戰鬥，連日極為激烈，日陸空部隊以旺盛之士氣邀擊敵軍，或進攻敵陣地予以重創。日海軍機隊，曾於十三日晨兩次轟炸波根維爾島塔羅基那敵飛機塲。投彈均命中敵軍事設施，確見黑烟冲天，火勢甚為猛烈，日機已全部安返基地。其他上隊，曾於是日　炸新幾內亞島孟達機塲，使敵軍事設施兩處發生大爆炸，對碼頭方面則施以集中轟炸，使蒙重創日機亦已全部飛返基地。日海軍機隊復於十四日轟炸新不列顚島次爾布及新幾內亞島布那方而敵運輸船，同日轟炸比萊島敵軍陣地，使一處起火，日機亦全部安返基地。又十五日敵機累計二百架曾三次來　加比恩，日陸十部隊當即邀擊，計擊落敵機十二架，日方被害輕微。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地電，新幾內亞方面戰事益趨熾烈，日陸軍守備隊及航空部隊，連日來積極向敵陣進攻，予以重創，日機十三日攻擊瓦比角及馬查布之敵機塲，而予以重大損害。十四日又邀擊來襲威瓦克及布茲之敵機，擊落其下十二架。是役日機損失戰鬭機二架，地上則幾無損失。</p>
<h3>告日本僑胞</h3>
<p>— 辻政信大佐</p>
<p>日本駐華派遺軍總司令部辻政信大佐，於本月入日，在上海國際劇塲，向日本僑民發表演講，中央社曾紀錄大意，在十日本報拐載。旋因讀者紛紛來函要求閱讀全文。爰特迻譯全文補刋於此，以供參考。</p>
<p>對大東亞戰爭之我見</p>
<p>諸君，自上海事變及大東亞戰爭發生以來，諸君官際上站在第一綫，直接間接為遂行戰事而活動，我們做軍人的目睹這許多事實，實不勝感謝。前年的今天，我參加馬來軍，渡過柔佛海映，迫近英國的老窠星加坡。去年的今日，是由瓜達爾客內爾鳥徹退成功之日。迨至令天，在馬紹爾羣島。方面正度開劇戰。這戰局如伺推移，將來如何演變，我從過去的經騐。略述所感，並想再談談在華的日本軍官民，在這時候，應怎樣為國盡職。我會於十二年前，第一次上海事變時，任中隊長，在江灣鎭喪失寶貴的部下十二人，中日事變中，曾參加太原的攻略戰，後來轉任關東軍，參加張鼓峯，諾蒙亭的戰事、再叵到漠口，立刻從事第一次長沙作戰，繼而進入南京。前年起由臺灣至西貢，大東亞職爭一發生，就從事攻陷星加坡，攻陷八打半島之後，返圈中國大陸參加浙報作戰，後來又參加瓜達爾喀納爾的劇戰。去年八月折返大陸，可說是有不可思議的緣分，或是有着武運吧。大東亞戰爭，發　於中日事變，而亦將結束於中日事變，我正與國家的運命，同一行動，實在覺得無上的光榮。</p>
<p>此次大東亞戰爭，究其遠因，乃發源於滿洲事變，而在中日事變中，逐漸釀成道種空氣，我相信由於中日事變的解決，可使戰事結束，現在先把前年所羅門方面的决戰實感向諸位報吿。第一綫的將士，在目前艱苦的職場，怎樣　戰，我且替許多的英魂，代為傳達。</p>
<p>瓜達爾喀納爾島的登陸戰</p>
<p>大家都知道，南太平洋的作戰，由我們看來，是追擊的延長，在敵方反攻的準備。日軍攻克新加坡，奪取爪哇，蘇門答臘，截斷緬甸，席捲新幾內亞，宛如風行草偃一般望着澳洲進攻。達到進攻的限度的時候，在最前綫與學備反攻的敵軍衝突了。我們的腦筋中還留着那開戰時的閃電戰果，在所羅門初次遭遇準備反攻的敵軍，元來並不輕視敵軍：不過有許多人想，　減敵眾，易如反掌。前年七月中旬，我到拉巴爾，那時候拉巴爾時時遺受轟炸。一方面在新幾內亞方面有勇敢聞名的工兵某隊長挺戰着。我為要和他見面，於七月二十六日托海軍提供驅逐艦。這是海軍參謀說：「唯，這並不是尋常的事呀！驅逐艦也不容易去，要覺悟决死。」我說。。「元來情形這麼嚴重嗎？不管它諸借一借，要去看一看。」於是由拉巴爾啓行，接近最劇戰的海岸的時候，海軍的將士，非常緊張，只注視着空中。敵機會飛來不：精神緊張着，但漸漸地黑雲多起來，一見天氣惡劣，海軍的將兵便喜歡說：今天很好。二十七日下午三點半鐘左右，敵四引擊大型飛機，飛在高空，偵察我們的軍艦而去。海軍的人說，不一會將有貴客光臨，果然不出三十分鐘，帶來四引擎的飛機二架，便開始轟炸。我是陸軍，不大明瞭海軍的大砲怎樣打法。我為要參觀，正要下甲板去的時候，左後方聽到炸聲，同時回頭一看，瞬間右邊的頭覺得彼痛打，就此倒下去了。摸一摸頭的前後，有兩個空洞，因為切斷小的動脈，流出很多的血。覺得地球在大廻轉似的。連這次在內，我已受傷五次，我忍耐着從甲板爬起，寫了報告，「應相當注意道次作戰，如現在敵軍掌握制空權之下，登陸作戰非展期不可。充分增加飛機，奪回制空權，然後才實施吧。」我這樣通　司令部。</p>
<p>二十八日黃昏，回到拉巴爾，呌我參加陸海軍的作戰會議，我也滿身染着血出席。我想，美國已恢復元氣，非相富留心不可。八月一日我由拉巴爾遄返大本營，把我的感想報告上司。入號我在軍醫學校的床上，聽到收音機，報告數軍在瓜達爾喀納爾島登陸的消息，並我海軍的偉大戰果。至九月中旬病愈，為要報復仇敵美軍，即赴瓜達爾喀納爾島。因為耍克服瓜島，便帶了最精說的某某兵團去。那時候的情形，因為敵機跳梁，自天絕對不能接近瓜烏。利用夜間使驅逐艦上的睦兵登陸，在天還未明的中間登陸，而要遠離島嶼。因為只在夜間行動，所以取名「老鼠輸運」。這樣而且危險，所以用小船沿着島嶼運去。這是好像螞蟻一般，所以取名「螞蟻輸運」。那末人雖可登陸但是不能把子彈與糧食搬到陸上，子彈和糧食如果不能搬到陸上，那麼甚難克服，所以非以運輸船强行輸運不可？於是　乘機到聯合艦隊，向山本司令長官閣下懇請，山本司令長官答應道：「可以，我親自出去，如果有必要的話。把軍艦駛到瓜達爾喀納爾島吧」。我非常感激，於是運輸船滿戰十彈和糧食，於十月七號登陸瓜達爾喀納爾島的加民普。</p>
<p>瓜島悽烈死決鬬情况</p>
<p>瓜島整個被密密的森林遮蔽着，海岸有些椰子樹。向着那椰子樹中，第一綫前進。恰巧在這海岸第一錢，有我士官學校時代的同期某某任部隊長，我為要和他見面，帶一個傳令兵一塊兒去。在第一綫會晤某部隊長，他的眼睛凹下去，鬍子很長，軍衣破裂，看不到這是一個月前，登陸哥利岬，躍入敵方飛機塲的部隊長之面影。我每次出戰的時候，都帶務這個天杯，把由拉巴爾帶來的威士忌酒，倒一些在這天杯，勸他喝說：「勞駕，喝吧」。部隊長某，流着眼淚，命令部下齊集，四十人左右的瘦削將校和卞士官，聞聞酒氣喝了道一點威士忌。我換一摸袋　。拿出由東京出發時帶着的蒜頭糖給他們吃，四十幾人伸出手來攤分吃。我問他戰事如何，部隊長始作笑容說，並不怎麼大的事情，美軍比中國兵士還要弱。不過沒有飯，如果有飯吃，光有銃劍便可勝利。入月十五號躍入敵機塲的時候，一個部下殺掉七個敵兵，對伏在壕內的敵兵，由背面加以刺殺，最少結果了三千人，雖然奪取了飛機塲，但沒有東西吃，怎麼辦呢？一個粢飯，可以抵住三天，但這也無濟於事，如果再給我二個粢飯，可以確保了飛機塲吧。眞是可惜，因為後方的接濟不能繼續，遂出莫大的犧牲。根本間題是飛機，是在乎制空權。那時候彼我的戰力比較起來，在地上敵勝我二倍，砲十倍，飛機二十倍。後來敵機又空襲司令部，遂央定以某某兵團的主力，開始總攻擊。然而因為大砲小，由正面不能收到相當的效果，決定在森林中，迂回至敵軍的後方，實施夜襲，於是由十月二十四日凡五天實行大夜襲職。敵軍有三百尊的大砲，一齊開砲，某某　下，不顧四十度以上的發熱，在散兵壕內指揮戰事，一方面給軍醫打針，一方面舊戰。吃的東西仍不能入手，吃了呌做男椰子的小椰十樹的芽，但苦得像吃筍子一般。不過這是唯一的糧食，十月三十號，由第一綫傳來消息說，敵軍將實施大反攻戰事。海岸方面的指揮官某上校，下了决心打電話來說：「將率領殊兵一百五十名，　軍旗作最後的突擊。」當即加以制止，並集了殘留着當值的兵士三五人，派去增援。這中間離司令部約有一百五十米突的地方，小槍迫近來，軍司令官以下覺悟决死了。好在十一月七日得到新銳兵團的援助，予敵軍以重大打擊，阻礙其反攻。在這中間，由海軍山本司令長官的智謀，在瓜島北方海上，擊沉敵航空母艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦多數，代替我們報仇了。（轉入第四版）</p>
<h3>土以國族為重　決不畏懼戰爭　中立政策仍保持不變</h3>
<p>斯丹埠十六日中央社電　土議員沙達克在亞聖報發表社論，以「士一耳其幷不畏懼戰爭」為題，內容係討論英土談判之關係者。謂土國已準備作一次國族之戰爭，沙氏稱，彼不信該項談判已陷僵局，如倫敦泰晤士報所傳。士國現面臨極端重要之問題，但不適宜於作公開討論。彼對不以欺騙及利用為基礎之英土友誼，相信必能征服一切之困難，而將自目前所傳之定着狀態獲一出路，但倘以土耳其人民如何聽從他人之所欲而驅使者，則實局謬誤。復對泰晤士報之申述，謂土耳其人民及土政府所遵行之政策之間，有極大之差異之論調，加以駁斥。泰晤士報所傳之英土談判之事件。土人幷無所知，但封土玫府之遠大目光之政治家之决定有所期待，士政府及人民對土參戰問題，均能當機立斷，倘有放棄中立之必要，土人亦將擁護政府。</p>

<h3>日陸軍報道部　發表緬甸戰況　並分析美渝空軍狀況</h3>
<p>中央社訊　本市日本陸軍報道部，昨日午後三時，假華　飯店八樓，循例會見本市中國新聞記者團，首由坂本中尉對緬甸戰况發表談話，嗣由赤星囑託對美渝空軍狀况加以分析，至四時餘始行散會，茲　其談話內容如次：</p>
<p>緬邊敵軍陷入重圍</p>
<p>最近企圖　向緬甸之英印軍，為推進其航空根據地日溪，及確保其攻擊據點起見。曾於一月初開始反攻，於一月十三日已進軍布其頓及蒙多，蓋敵軍欲獲空軍根據地日溪，必先取得布其頓蒙多二據點，方能開始反攻，日軍方面因蒙多方面，在作職上己無價値而予放棄，同時進軍南下，對蒙多布其頓諸點，加以載繫，以阻敵軍反攻，日軍主力沿馬猶河南下挺進，於二月四日獎精說步隊於頓勃柴，復於入日調主力向敵背突繫，將敵軍緊密包圍，向　集於此之敵第五師第七師展開激烈之殲減戰，敵軍不支敗退，企圖於馬猶山脈及納夫河之左右岸，向北還逃，嗣經日軍空陸呼應，刻敵軍正陷於絕境，衆料第二次之阿拉坎慘敗，又將實演。</p>
<p>美渝空軍情況一般</p>
<p>美在渝空軍之實力，據估計約爲戰鬥機及轟炸機二百餘架，自去歲十月迄今，吾方所獲戰果，則敵方蒙受之損失）渝美空軍被擊落及擊毀者數達二四〇架，至於目前渝方所以有二百餘架，乃最近由印度及其地方面愉送來者，敵方雖損失綦重，但我人對前途亦未可過分樂觀。按渝美職機種類計有轟炸機B24型（四發動），B25型（中型僅二發動），戰鬥機P40型P38型，及最近接濟淪方者。是項戰鬥機，係由美建造，續航力一四〇〇公里，速度一小時六〇〇公里，高度二四〇〇公尺，具有口徑十七米幣之機槍六架，上述情形為美在淪空軍之槪况。其餘美渝混台部隊，但數僅十架而已。至於整個敵美空軍，現共有十五師團，其中第一至四師團駐於本土，第五師團在新幾內亞方面，第六師國在巴拿馬方面，第七師團在夏威夷一帶，第八師團則駐英本土，第九師團在歐洲中東部，第十師團還駐印度，第十一師團在北端阿留幾亞方面，第十三師　在沙羅門方面。其餘第二二·第十五·二師　在北非方面，在淪之美空軍第十四航空部隊，並非全部，僅屬其中抽出之一部份而已。</p>
<p>美方企圖不易實現</p>
<p>美太平洋艦隊總司令尼米么會謂：除以中國大陸作根據地，來攻擊日本本土外，別無他策，故日軍對美在渝空軍之活　極為注意，在思實上美日以跳島作戰，企圖進攻日本土，而於種種情形，其不易實現、巳夢露無潰，深望中國人民也能注意此種重大的事連著。</p>
<p>最摟據禾經完全證官之情報稱：一美在渝　軍，　　　三十師，以美將校為幹部，渝軍為部下」，其實際如何雖未經完全證實，但觀諸美以渝作根據地以襲日本之企圖言之，或許有些事實。最近復聞美在渝空軍司令部，已由昆明推進至桂林，但於他們有種種企圖之前，日本在華精銳之航空部隊，即加以襲擊，毀其一切設施。</p>
<p>本月十三日敵方以江西作為空軍根據地，正建築機塲之際，已這日軍航空部隊之猛烈轟炸。最近在華日空軍逐漸堅强，軍慶亦予承認，最近在一月廿九日美紐約泰晤士報重慶通訊員曾電其本國　：在淪美空軍對日本最新式之精銳航空部隊上有一東條」二字者異常畏懼，蓋日機之性能器機與戰拔進步極快」云。同時美上議員布理哥土他亦會說明「美在渝空軍與日最新式航空部隊遭遇時，美力　機七架中，至少有五架為日機繫落」，除此而外。其他類似記載甚多。</p>
<p>紐約泰晤士報曾載反軸心航空部隊見日空軍時，均光貝戒心，故　戰屢北」云云。</p>

<h3>游資何處去了？</h3>
<p>戰時的經濟上海·有一個最矛盾的形態，就是什麼方案，什麼對策，一經施諸上海，其結果總是適當其反，祇要看棉紗的黑市價格，視收買以前高出幾何，米糧的黑市價格，視統制以前高出幾何，油，糖，火柴，肥皂以至一切其他日常用品的黑市價格，視配給以前高出幾何，就可以知這上海市塲上的畸形狀態了：尤其是農曆新年以來的囤貨風氣，早也不曾猖厥如此，遲也不至猖獗如此，而獨猖獗於去年大結束期間，周財長訓戒金融緊縮放款以防春夾囤貨之後，由此看來，益令人感覺「為政不在多言」，因為利慾之所薰，巳令一般暴利主義者完全失其聽覺了。</p>
<p>我們對於游資之歸宿一個問題，言之屢矣，竟想不到「增產年」的開塲白便是「囤貨」！游資流入股票投機路上而為我們所詬病的言論，尙覺　墨未乾，竟會來了一個比股票投機還要嚴東的普遍囤貨，難怪在最近一個期間股票市况不振的情態下，人人都會知道游資何處去了。須知股票的投機，其結果固然是等於自殺，可是，假定為正當的生產證券而投資，則其結果到底，尙不為無利於生產，至於囤積投機，則非但等於自殺，並且是自殺而無生還之路，因為投資於囤積，不管怎樣去解釋，總是無補於生產的，充其量不過為個人生財之道，可是，一人肥而衆人瘦了，其結果必然弄成物價漲無止境，民不職生，挺而走險，非但要成為最嚴重的生活問題，並且要成為最嚴重的治安問題，有關當局亟宜未雨綢繆，當機立斷，萬勿令其成為肺病第三期，以至於不治之症！</p>
<h3>一區經濟處　加強調查工作　取締違反規章情事</h3>

<h3>告日本僑胞　至妙的作戰</h3>
<p>於是我奉了命令歸還本國，到海岸的途中，在一個河中有一個兵士傘着空的飯食，他喝了一口河水，看看我的險說，「參謀閣下，我的背獲中有一本儲金簿，我願意把這儲金簿獻上，請去造飛機吧，』說完倒下去了。大約這個兵士的家庭貧窮，有着年老的父母，他把擺金簿很寶責地裝在背袋裹。他臨到耍死的關頭，並不是不平或不滿意，還要把這些錢損作飛機之用呢。前來增援的某某兵團，巷着某兵團與敵掙職。新來的旣是精銳又多少帶有糧食，自此凡兩個月半，雖然後方的迎絡被敵軍載斷，但這某某兵團怎樣奮戰，且舉證來說，集了所剩無幾的戰友之糧食，匯做一週間左右分的米，編成三，五人的决戰隊，秘密潛人森林中，炸碎敵軍的飛機塲和重砲陣地，或跳入敵軍司令部刺殺敵人，不分盡夜，三人五人的决死隊，衛破森林刺殺敵軍。我回到大本營把這個狀况報告了。這中間瓜烏的兵團來電報說：「吃的東西已盡，沒有苔草，椰十樹的果實和軍芽都沒有了。不過有的是槍劍，自軍司令官以下，至最後的一卒决意奮戰，精放心。』電報中沒有一次說起要子彈或米糧。日本的兵隊出發斥　，常常在密林中與美兵碰到，他們有十個人，這邊只有二個，他們十個人却拋棄槍桿逃亡，他們决不實行夜襲，就是突擊而來，也不敢進入這邊的陣地。不過以轟炸砲擊機關槍施以搽射，絕對不敢露出頭面，這與中國的兵隊大不相同，重慶的兵隊是以將校為先鋒前來攻打，我也曾經會渦幾次。美兵恃其物力，只施以砲炸　與艦砲射擊，絕對不敢用槍劍而來，這是他們的真正姿態了。關於瓜島的作戰，因為地基不大好，而日在這裹要出多大犠牲，並不是得策，决定重建基地了，由常識想來，在這裘的軍隊，不能逃脫蔽機的轟炸，但去年二月一日，〇〇以上的軍隊，一個也沒有損失，能够完全轉進了。轉進後過了三天，美國電台廣播說：「日本兵有退却之模樣，由現在起美軍將實施追擊。」這時候日本兵連一人也不存在該島，誠是死孔明嚇走活仲達之計呢。</p>
<p>精强無比的日軍精神：在這半年的惡戰苦鬥中，沒有一個兵士對軍司令官或上級長官，發出不平。這是因為軍司令官，幕僚，兵隊同在一個條件之下，耐得住第一綫飛機的轟炸，糧食的缺乏。後來的作戰經過，大家所知道，瓜島我軍撤艮前後，新幾內亞，听羅門方面，敵軍以多過我軍十倍的兵力，繼續反攻而來。對於吉爾貝特島及馬紹爾羣島亦然。然而我們觀察起來，他們在這兩年中，到底前進了多少呢？最近敵軍對那微少的馬紹爾烏嶼加以攻盤。但這當中，敵軍最少已喪失二十師的兵力，並損失戰艦，航空母艦及太平洋艦隊的半數以上了。　種重大的犧牲，不過換來幾個無人居住的島嶼而已。反之，日軍的戰績，自開戰以來，半年的中間，攻陷星加坡，爪哇，蘇門答臘，進而截斷緬甸，控制新幾內亞。一方面在中國依然箝制美空軍的蠢動，這半年間的戰績與他們兩年間的戰績與消耗相比較起來，戰局的前途將如何展開，是極明　的，在約這個戰爭，亦將與這方向同樣地進展下去。美兵耐不住四個月在戰塲，使要求代替。日本兵士就是二年，三年；至最後的一卒，亦莞爾從事挺　，沒有一個人會不平的，由這人點看來。這次戰事越延長下去，美軍勢將屈膝，即在精神上亦已輸了。這種可怕的日本兵的勇敢和不敗的精神，到底出什麼地力來的，終結說來，這並不是日本人個人的力量，其根源在乎國體。道天杯（這時大佐把天杯示衆）在此十年間每下個戰塲，都裝在我的衣袋裏，戰　碰到艱困的時候，緊要的時候，或是對　終的兵士，我曾川這天杯加以激勵安慰，這不知有多少次。上自軍司令官，下至二等兵士，用着這御杯奮起，這是沒有什麽理由，惟有我們生在這國體之中，欣然死於天子的命令之下而已了。（未完）（弘翔：譯自二月九日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　羊譯</p>
<p>（四）龜海</p>
<p>於是這「海龜」的綽號，不知不覺地，在分隊的中間，擴展起來了。「海龜」是稱呼初期時代潛水艇的海軍隱　，一個單毅式卑陋的小型船艦，燃着萬式的汽油引擎，拼力地向水中潛沉着，好像眞人練習游泳時的情形彷彿。然而，這綽號被一般同學們都認定了的，是在奪槓子的時候</p>
<p>奪槓子是江田島盛事之一。在每星期六要舉行一次，四號學生最初不過在旁邊參觀着。眞人認定　奪構子，就是故鄉那「搶將官」，不過把將官變作槓子而已。尤其是這不但是互相比較力量，同時運用所謂團體競爭的神謀奇略，是有進步性的·總而言之，在鹿兒島時對技量是有自信力的，所以靜符着出陣的機會，而這時機，終於來臨了。</p>
<p>但是，開始的喇叭響了的時候，感到全身戰慄起來，剛從廁所回來的，而又想去小便了。因為奪槓子是在兵學校各種競技之中，是極微烈的，好像是必勝精神的顯聖似的，這是一向時常見着過的。要是敵方的時候，即使是上級學生，也可以隨使毆打，衝撞，脚踢的，簡捷地說起來，就是一種團體打架。要說起打架，眞人是有生以來也沒有過經騐的，所以雖然希望參加這競技，同時胸中感到志忑不安。</p>
<p>不久，將所有的分隊，分作奇偶二組，以掛　紅白旗的長　子為中心，六尺高的大漢們，組成本陣，守護內圈，在那周圍，　眞人等的小卒們，結成隊伍，守護外圈，進擊隊則在中途阻止敵人的進攻。這是防衛部隊，我方的攻擎部隊，都是劍術柔術的高級者，勇敢地殺進敵人的本陣，或攀登敵人身上奪取槓子，或潛人下方，拔引槓子根的·敵我雙方，俱都穿着厚蓬布的奪橫子服，是沒帽子赤着脚的勇敢的扮裝。</p>
<p>一奪取開始！手持着軍扇的運動長這樣下着命令，同時喇叭也響了，我方的攻擊隊，像脫重似的飛跑着，而到在相等距離的地點，便要逢到敵人的攻擊隊來襲，所以我方的遊擎隊，便要開始猛烈地防害。</p>
<p>（眞幹哪眞幹哪！）眞人這樣地看呆了，那時候有一個人向他頭　碰地一聲打下去。</p>
<p>「幹甚麼！一很溫順的他，不由地也怒上心頭，轉過頭來一看，己經有一個帶着敵方胸章的跑近邊來了。眞人深想對他復　，將挽着的手抽出來回擎他，但是，忽然地停止。恐怕倘若因此而外圈陣地之一角崩壞了呢——有一個人開始大聲一笑，忽然問又卷入笑的過中去了。</p>
<p>「谷這個家伙，到底是海龜。今天又潛下去，立了大功……一</p>

<h3>The Preconditions for the Success of the Rice Control Committee: Sound Personnel and Unified Authority</h3>
<p>At the recent joint meeting of cadres of the Rice Control Committee, we casually reviewed the proposals distributed to the attendees and found them to be focused on minor details. The reports were nothing more than achievements and the overcoming of difficulties. Yesterday's editorial specifically put forward "telling the truth" as a contribution to the participants. However, after reading the proposals and reports, one feels that the attendees would find it difficult to thoroughly read these tens of thousands of words of reports and proposals within the short span of three or four days, let alone study the proposals and review the reports. On the other hand, there is still a sense of superficiality in the proposals and reports. As a result, the proposals are passed by vote, and the reports are simply filed away, no different from ordinary meetings. From this perspective, can the clarity of the future business guidelines produced based on such reports and suggestions not cause concern?</p>
<p>However, the issue of rice control is, after all, the most important livelihood issue. The success or failure of the rice control undertaking is currently the key to improving people's livelihoods and is closely related to the victory of the war. Therefore, the Rice Control Committee authorities and all staff bear direct responsibility, and the public also has the duty to supervise and assist. Our suggestions and encouragement from the journalistic community are even more unavoidable. Although the work of the committee in the past has not satisfied the expectations of the people, we sincerely hope for its practical improvement in the future. Because of the earnestness of our expectations, we cannot help but speak frankly. Of course, we have absolutely no preconceived notions; if we do, it is only the hope for a thorough and practical improvement. Now, we reiterate the two points we previously advocated, namely, sound personnel and unified authority, as the preconditions for whether rice control can be improved:</p>
<p>First, personnel must be sound. Strict rectification of personnel is still the top priority for the committee. All the committee's business is inextricably linked to the word "profit." The past news of malfeasance and exploitation is disheartening. For example, after procurement merchants pay a deposit to obtain procurement qualifications, they can borrow huge amounts of procurement funds from banks. After the rice is procured, it is not directly handed over to the Rice Control Committee but is indirectly sold on the black market to obtain the difference between the official procurement price and the black market price, enriching their own pockets. On the one hand, they repay the bank loan, and on the other hand, they make excuses for not being able to procure. By this point, the procurement merchants' pockets are full, the Rice Control Committee has no rice to use, and it is only the public who suffers from black market exploitation. Another example is that the Rice Control Committee requires a huge number of burlap sacks for packing rice. After a portion of the burlap sacks are purchased, they cannot be used due to being damaged. The people involved enrich themselves, and the Rice Control Committee suffers a great loss, which is also a great loss for the public. Such loopholes are all manifestations of unsound personnel in the Rice Control Committee. Sound personnel is the driving force for promoting the normal development of the enterprise. To achieve enterprise development, it is necessary to take whether the personnel are sound as a prerequisite. And the content of sound personnel is to employ people based on their talents, pay attention to screening, and severely punish any malfeasance without favoritism. If rewards and punishments are not clear, the personnel system will never be sound.</p>
<p>Second, authority must be unified. Since the Rice Control Committee is responsible for the entire control mission, the procurement, storage, transportation, and distribution should all be handled by the committee in a unified manner, with unified authority and dedicated responsibility. Not only that, but at the same time, it should also jointly promote increased rice production. It is heard that in certain rice-producing areas, the purchase price is lower than the cost, and various compulsory measures are imposed on farmers, making farmers regard rice cultivation as a daunting task, which not only does not increase production but also lowers production. At the same time, to prevent low-price purchases, farmers would rather secretly brew wine or make sugar with the rice they produce to avoid being purchased. Such facts cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Sound personnel and unified authority are actually one and two, two and one. Only with sound personnel can we gain the trust of all parties and promote unified authority. Only with sound personnel can unified authority be fully utilized. Otherwise, merely having unified authority will only lead to more chaos.</p>
<h3>Smooth Progress of the Battle on the Burmese Border; Japanese Forces Tighten the Encirclement; The Main Force of the British Seventh Division's Retreat is Cut Off</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base on the Burmese front, the main force of the British Seventh Division, numbering several thousand, had its retreat completely cut off. After fleeing into a certain area on the eastern side of the Mayu Mountains, they are still putting up a last-ditch resistance with medium-caliber artillery, field guns, hundreds of armored vehicles, and hundreds of heavy-duty trucks. However, various elite units of the Japanese army have completed an encirclement net of approximately four kilometers from east to west and approximately one kilometer from north to south. Since the 12th, they have coordinated air and ground forces to launch a heroic annihilation battle, pressing closer to the desperately resisting enemy. Therefore, whether the enemy will be completely annihilated or surrender is only a matter of time. Furthermore, a portion of the enemy that escaped encirclement has been scattered and wandering between the Mayu River and the foothills of the Mayu Mountains. However, they are now being pursued by Japanese army mopping-up teams and have no way to escape, and many are surrendering one after another. At the same time, a certain unit of the Japanese army that occupied a certain place is coordinating with a certain unit of the Japanese army that broke through the Mayu Mountain pass and advanced into a certain country's territory, and has begun to advance in a certain direction. Furthermore, a part of a certain unit of the Japanese army that occupied Dongu Bazar has begun to advance in a certain direction. The war situation is progressing smoothly.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base on the Indo-Burmese border in the south, after several thousand British and Indian soldiers had their retreat cut off by the Japanese army from behind, they made every effort to use all of their hundreds of tanks and hundreds of heavy-duty trucks to quickly turn towards the Mayu Mountains and moved while providing fierce covering fire, attempting to escape towards Noga Yedok (this place is located on the only road that traverses the Mayu Mountain pass). However, the Japanese army had anticipated this and sent elite troops to wait in that direction. When the enemy arrived, they were immediately hit head-on, causing them to fall into great chaos. On the morning of the 12th, the Japanese encirclement net was compressed even further. The British Seventh Division, whose equipment General Montbatten boasted as being the best, has now been forced into a bag only four kilometers from east to west and one kilometer from north to south, with nowhere to run, aimlessly circling around. It is expected that they will soon face the fate of being annihilated. Furthermore, the Indian National Army, which is closely cooperating with the Japanese army in the fighting, is very active and has given the Indian troops on the enemy side a great shock. Therefore, hundreds of Indian soldiers are coming to defect every day. The wavering within the British and Indian armies is like a prairie fire. It is expected that Arakan will become the starting point for a total uprising in India.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army's Preemptive Strike is of Great Significance; The Important Point of Dongu Bazar Has Been Occupied</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base on the Burmese front, after launching a preemptive offensive, the Japanese army on the Indo-Burmese border quickly occupied the important point of Dongu Bazar. This place is an important town of the enemy along the upper reaches of the Mayu River and the banks of the Na Kin River. It is a military supply accumulation point for traversing the Mayu Mountains and passing through the North Akian and Guba Bazar routes, and it is also an air force base, so it is also a stronghold for disrupting the Japanese army. Furthermore, Nakin Akian is an important transportation route from Mengduo through Poli Bazar to India, and the blood transfusion route from Mengduo to Buki Dun is also centered on this place. Therefore, this place is of important strategic significance in the operation to retake Burma. The enemy has been clamoring for a long time, planning to launch an offensive as soon as all preparations are completed. After the rainy season, they will gather troops at various bases, take Nakin Akian and Guba Bazar as forward strongholds, and use the Naf River to the Na Kin River as a supply line, and launch an invasion war from one base to another, attempting to retake the Mengduo and Buki Dun areas, and then gradually pressure Akab. However, the Japanese army occupied Nakin Akian only thirty hours after the start of the attack, and occupied Dongu Bazar in six days. At the same time, they seized all the large quantities of military supplies accumulated in these two places, causing the northern retreat and supply line of the enemy troops advancing into the Mengduo and Buki Dun area to be lost. The British Seventh Division in front of Buki Dun was then surrounded by the Japanese army in a certain area and suffered the fate of being annihilated. As a result, the enemy's operational plan collapsed fundamentally. According to the initial stage of this battle, if the Japanese army attacked these two places from the front, the results would be minimal. Therefore, the Japanese army changed its tactics and launched a surprise attack, occupying these two places. Therefore, this operation is of great significance.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) A dispatch from a certain Japanese base in Burma states that the Burmese army's bomber squadron, taking advantage of the moonlit night on the 14th, attacked Mengduo and dropped a large number of bombs on the enemy's concentrated troops, inflicting heavy damage. The enemy's assembled vehicles and several military supply accumulation points were bombed into a large fire. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. Subsequently, a squadron of fighter planes was dispatched to attack Xinze Wa, and a fierce air battle was launched with twenty enemy Spitfire fighters. In an instant, nine Spitfire enemy planes were shot down. In this battle, the Japanese army also sacrificed one plane.</p>
<h3>The Morale of the Indian National Army is High</h3>
<p>Yangon, 16th (Central News Agency) A dispatch from a Burmese front base states that the activity of the Free Indian National Army on the front line this time is of profound significance. A part of the Indian troops commanded by Montbatten stationed on the northern front of Buki Dun has now surrendered. Therefore, the morale of the Indian National Army is extremely high. They are now pressing closely on the enemy retreating westward from the Mayu Mountains, fighting bravely to win the independence of their motherland. Therefore, Bose's ideal of completing India's independence by force has been fully demonstrated in the annihilation battle on the Mayu Peninsula, and the enemy's exhaustion has been fully revealed here.</p>
<h3>Courts Must Not Accumulate or Delay Civil and Criminal Cases; Minister of Justice Zhang Admonishes His Subordinates</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Since taking office as Minister of Justice, Zhang Yipeng has spared no effort in planning for China's judiciary and has repeatedly admonished his subordinates. Recently, in order to ensure the time limit for investigation and trial of criminal cases, and to assess diligence and prevent accumulated cases, he issued a special order to instruct his subordinates. The original text is recorded as follows: "The rules on the time limit for investigation and trial of criminal cases stipulate very strict requirements. The original purpose was to assess diligence and prevent accumulated cases, and orders have been issued to comply with the rules. However, in recent times, some case-handling personnel in courts at all levels have regarded the rules as mere formalities, resulting in cases that have long been pending or summonses being delayed after acceptance. As a result, many malpractices have arisen, and people are complaining, which is very inappropriate. It should be known that litigation is enough to harm the people, and it also damages the credibility of the judiciary. Therefore, I order you to instruct your subordinates to comply with the rules. In the future, when receiving cases, you must summon people at any time. For those with criminals in custody, you should handle the cases quickly and not delay in the slightest. All relevant responsible officials should deeply understand this and pay attention to it, and strictly supervise it. If the above-mentioned situation is discovered again, it will be dealt with separately according to the circumstances and punished according to the law. You must all abide by this."</p>
<p>Civil Affairs: In addition to this, he is also very concerned about civil cases and has issued a special order to sincerely admonish his subordinates. The original text is recorded below: "Civil cases are complicated, and careful examination is certainly important, but prompt resolution is even more necessary. Every day of delay in the court means another day of burden on the people. Therefore, the Ministry previously found that some courts at higher and local levels were sluggish in handling cases, with pending cases delayed for more than a year and summonses issued as many as seven or eight times, yet still not resolved. According to the registers, there were quite a few such cases. On January 23 of last year, the Ministry issued General Order No. 97, instructing that all such accumulated civil cases be properly resolved within three months, which was duly complied with. However, after reviewing the registers submitted by the courts last year, only the Wuchang District Court had completely cleared all cases by the end of the 32nd year of the Republic, with no accumulated cases. In addition, the Hubei High Court had only eight pending cases at the end of the year, while the number of accumulated cases in other high and local courts was actually small. In particular, according to reports, the Shanghai District Court had 1,173 accumulated cases as of August last year; the Zhejiang High Court had 203 accumulated cases as of October last year; and the Jiangsu High Court had 156 accumulated cases as of November. In addition, the cases received by the court branches in various places and the county governments concurrently handling judicial affairs often could not be offset by the cases closed each month, and there were many cases that had been pending for more than a year or half a year. Civil cases usually take more than three months to resolve from the day after acceptance, and according to the monthly reporting method, they are considered delayed cases. From the perspective of duty, this is not appropriate. Even if there were vacancies due to personnel changes in the past, or there were many changes due to the reorganization of national institutions, resulting in a large number of accumulated cases, the cases were shelved. On the people's side, long-term delays are a source of great pain. For the sake of resolving lawsuits and facilitating the people, the Minister hereby reiterates the previous order that all accumulated cases should be resolved as quickly as possible, and should not be allowed to continue indefinitely, causing resentment among the people. The presidents of the high courts have the responsibility of supervision and should urge their subordinates at any time to sweep away the habit of accumulating cases in the past. If the case-handling personnel still arbitrarily delay matters, they may be reported truthfully for disciplinary action. The Ministry will take this as the standard for promotion and demotion and will not show any leniency. You must all be careful. This order is hereby issued for compliance, and you are instructed to instruct your subordinates to comply with and implement it together."</p>
<h3>Exchange of Asian Envoys between Japan and Manchukuo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) The Manchukuo Cooperative Association will send Minister of Agriculture Huang Fuo as an Asian envoy to Japan around the 12th anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo on March 1, and will also hold lectures in various parts of Japan. Recently, the Asian Headquarters of the Great Japan Political Assistance Association decided to send Nagai Ryutaro, an advisor to the association, as a repayment Asian envoy in return, and is currently making all preparations. At a time when the Pacific war situation is becoming increasingly important, the Asian movement between Japan and Manchukuo will advance by leaps and bounds, and the connection between the two countries will be rapidly strengthened. Therefore, this move is of great significance.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) Japanese Ambassador to China Gu, since the 14th, had gone to Wuhan to inspect, accompanied by Navy Attache Nakamura, Investigator Ogawa, and Secretary Ishiguro. He returned to Nanjing on the 16th. The Information Department of the Japanese Embassy also announced at 3 p.m. that Ambassador Gu had departed on the 14th to inspect the situation in Wuhan. He had cordial talks with the heads of the Chinese and Japanese military and government officials in the area and visited the actual situation before returning on the 16th.</p>
<h3>The Thai Government Decides to Evacuate Government Agencies</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 16th (Central News Agency) The Thai government announced on wireless radio on the night of the 15th that in view of the current situation under decisive battle, it has decided to evacuate government agencies. It has now been selected to set up the central government agency in a certain place in the Silo Korak Mountains near Fakimburi County and Pikhun Sakham County, and has ordered the Chief of Police of Anton to work on it.</p>

<h3>The Government Will Severely Sanction Those Who Raise Prices Arbitrarily; A Person in Charge of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Made a Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) Recently, prices in various places have soared, exceeding the price limit by several times, causing unease and anxiety among the people. If this continues, it will hinder the stability of people's lives and the tranquility of social order. In order to understand the authorities' countermeasures to this serious problem, the reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to inquire about what countermeasures will be taken to reasonably solve the problem, stabilize people's lives, and maintain the wartime economic system. According to the discussion, the Ministry has long been aware of this and is now actively planning to find a reasonable solution. In addition to immediately sending personnel to various provinces and cities to investigate the actual situation, and ordering the authorities of various provinces and cities to strictly and conscientiously comply with the Provisional Regulations on Price Management, at the same time, they will make every effort to dredge the sources and further rationalize the allocation methods, and will never tolerate or ignore those who hoard and speculate. Those who arbitrarily raise prices will also be severely sanctioned to balance prices and stabilize people's lives.</p>
<h3>The Customs Lighthouse Ship "Liuxing" Was Blindly Bombed by American Aircraft; A Japanese Reporter Recalls the Incident</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Japanese reporter Ooba, dispatched by the Japanese fleet's reporting department, boarded the Japanese Navy warship 〇〇 and worked with the Japanese Navy soldiers in the South China Sea area of China. According to a telegram from Ooba from that area, on the 24th of last month, American aircraft blindly bombed the unarmed Chinese Customs lighthouse ship "Liuxing" and strafed it with machine guns, causing more than 20 Chinese people floating on the sea surface to die. The Japanese army then rendered assistance.</p>
<p>The gist of it is: On January 24, American B52-type aircraft of the US Air Force stationed in the United States appeared in the South China Sea and blindly bombed Chinese Customs lighthouse ships. Many Chinese people suffered as a result, which is something we cannot forget. On the 23rd, the wind speed in the South China Sea was about 30 meters per second, and the waves were huge. The warship 〇〇, on which five people were riding, also departed from 〇〇 port on the 23rd and headed north towards a certain place. After sailing for about 〇 hours, it only advanced 〇 kilometers. The sailing situation at that time was very dangerous. Later, following the captain's order, it returned to 〇〇 port. The next morning, the wind and waves subsided slightly, and it continued north, and on the afternoon of the 24th, it stopped near 〇〇 Bay. Not long after anchoring, it received a telegram that the enemy aircraft had attacked the "Liuxing." We were stunned when we heard this. In an instant, we were all ignited with the battle to punish the US Air Force and avenge the ship. The ship was also preparing for battle at the same time. Although we waited for a long time, we did not find any trace of it that day.</p>
<p>After nightfall, spring was full, and 〇〇 Bay was milky white. On that day, the enemy Air Force attacked the completely unprepared fishing village 〇〇 Island in a formation of five aircraft, flying at a low altitude of about 50 meters and strafing with machine guns. It then went north along Wu and encountered the "Liuxing" heading south to supply materials to the 〇〇 Island lighthouse. The ship's body was painted white and had no weapons. It could not withstand a single blow from the enemy aircraft. The ship was hit and immediately capsized and smoked. There was no way to rescue it. The Chinese crew members all hated the US Air Force's tyrannical and illegal behavior to the bone. At that time, the wind and waves in the South China Sea were extremely strong. After the crew members jumped into the water, they floated on the sea surface. However, the American aircraft still refused to fly away and, after the ship sank, continued to strafe the Chinese crew members floating on the sea surface with machine guns from the air.</p>
<p>That night, the ship was ordered to rescue the victims who had arrived on 〇〇 Island on sailboats. By the time the ship arrived at 〇〇 Island, it was almost dawn, and only the shadows of the colored islands were visible. The ship illuminated the bird with a searchlight, and the ship's marines changed to small boats and went to the island. At that time, the cold wind was biting, and after landing, the victims each held a lamp, and each person's face was extremely nervous, and they all talked about the US Air Force's tyrannical behavior. The British and Americans not only fabricated the Japanese army's maltreatment of their prisoners but also illegally bombed the Japanese Red Cross ships and the Chinese Customs lighthouse ships. If the Chinese people in Chongqing saw their compatriots being abused by Americans, what would they think?</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb the Danzhu Airfield</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from a Japanese military base on the 16th, the Japanese air force, at 5:30 p.m. on the 13th, launched a joint large-formation raid on the Danzhu Airfield in Guangxi Province with fighter-bombers, destroying part of its runway and military facilities. This airfield was recently planned to be used by the enemy as a forward base, and it is said that the damage caused by the Japanese aircraft's preemptive bombing was extremely large.</p>
<h3>Battles in the Southwest Pacific Become More Intense</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific, the battles in the Southwest Pacific have been extremely intense in recent days. The Japanese army and air force have been inviting the enemy to attack with strong morale, or attacking the enemy's positions and inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese naval air force bombed the enemy's airfield in Tarokina, Bougainville Island, twice on the morning of the 13th. The bombs all hit the enemy's military facilities, and black smoke was seen soaring into the sky, and the fire was very fierce. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base. Other upper units bombed the enemy's airfield in Munda, New Guinea, on the same day, causing two major explosions at the enemy's military facilities. They concentrated bombing on the wharf, causing heavy damage. All Japanese aircraft also flew back to base. The Japanese naval air force bombed the enemy's transport ships in Czirubu, New Britain, and the enemy's positions in Buna, New Guinea, on the 14th, setting one place on fire. All Japanese aircraft also returned safely to base. In addition, on the 15th, a total of 200 enemy aircraft attacked Gabian three times. The Japanese army and the Tenth Division immediately invited them to attack, shooting down 12 enemy aircraft. The Japanese side suffered minor damage.</p>

<h3>To Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>— Colonel Masanobu Tsuji</p>
<p>Colonel Masanobu Tsuji of the Japanese Expeditionary Army Headquarters in China, after entering Japan this month, gave a speech to Japanese residents at the Shanghai International Theater. The Central News Agency recorded the gist of it, which was reprinted in this newspaper on the tenth. Due to numerous letters from readers requesting to read the full text, we have translated and published the full text here for reference.</p>
<p>My Views on the Greater East Asia War</p>
<p>Gentlemen, since the Shanghai Incident and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, you have stood on the front lines in official and private capacities, engaging in activities directly and indirectly to advance the war effort. We, as soldiers, have witnessed these many facts and are deeply grateful. This day last year, I joined the Malaya Army, crossed the Johor Strait, and approached the old nest of the British, Singapore. This day last year was the day of the successful withdrawal from Guadalcanal Island. And today, fierce battles are unfolding in the Marshall Islands. How this war situation will shift and evolve in the future, I will briefly describe my feelings based on past experience, and I would also like to talk about how Japanese military officers and civilians in China should fulfill their duties to the country at this time. Twelve years ago, during the first Shanghai Incident, I served as a company commander and lost twelve valuable subordinates in Jiangwan Town. During the Sino-Japanese War, I participated in the capture of Taiyuan, later transferred to the Kwantung Army, and participated in the battles of Zhanggufeng and Nomonhan. After returning to Mokou, I immediately engaged in the first Changsha campaign, and then entered Nanjing. From Taiwan to Saigon since the year before last, as soon as the Greater East Asia War broke out, I was involved in the capture of Singapore, the capture of the Malay Peninsula, and then returned to mainland China to participate in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, and later participated in the fierce battle of Guadalcanal. Returning to the mainland last August, it can be said that there is an incredible fate or good fortune in battle. The Greater East Asia War originated from the Sino-Japanese Incident and will also end with the Sino-Japanese Incident. I feel truly honored to be acting in concert with the destiny of the country.</p>
<p>The underlying cause of this Greater East Asia War originated in the Manchurian Incident, and gradually brewed into this atmosphere during the Sino-Japanese Incident. I believe that the resolution of the Sino-Japanese Incident can end the war. Now, I will first report to you my real feelings about the decisive battle in the Solomon Islands the year before last. How the soldiers on the front lines are fighting in the current difficult workplace, and I will convey this on behalf of many heroic souls.</p>
<p>The Landing Operation on Guadalcanal Island</p>
<p>As everyone knows, from our perspective, the South Pacific operations were an extension of the pursuit and the enemy's preparation for a counteroffensive. The Japanese army captured Singapore, seized Java and Sumatra, cut off Burma, and swept through New Guinea, advancing toward Australia like wind sweeping through grass. When the limit of advance was reached, the front lines clashed with the enemy forces preparing to counterattack. Our minds still retained the blitzkrieg results at the start of the war. When we first encountered the enemy preparing to counterattack in the Solomon Islands, we did not originally underestimate the enemy. However, many people thought that reducing the enemy's numbers was as easy as turning one's hand. In mid-July of the year before last, I arrived in Rabaul. At that time, Rabaul was constantly being bombed. On the other hand, a certain captain of the engineering corps, known for his courage, was fighting hard in New Guinea. In order to meet him, I requested a destroyer from the Navy on July 26. The naval staff officer said, "Well, this is not an ordinary matter! It's not easy to get a destroyer. Be prepared for a death wish." I said, "Is the situation really that serious? I don't care, just lend me one, I want to go take a look." So I departed from Rabaul. As we approached the coast of the fiercest battle, the naval officers and soldiers were very nervous, only watching the sky. They were tense, fearing enemy planes would come, but gradually the black clouds increased. Seeing the bad weather, the naval soldiers happily said: Today is good. Around 3:30 PM on July 27, two enemy four-engine large aircraft flew at high altitude to reconnoiter our warship. The naval personnel said that guests would be visiting soon. Sure enough, within thirty minutes, two four-engine aircraft came and started bombing. I am an army man and don't quite understand how the navy's cannons work. I was about to go down to the deck to observe when I heard an explosion to my left rear. At the same time, I turned my head and instantly felt a sharp blow to the right side of my head and fell down. I touched the front and back of my head and there were two holes. Because small arteries had been cut, a lot of blood was flowing out. I felt like the earth was spinning around. Including this time, I had been wounded five times. I endured and crawled up from the deck and wrote a report: "Considerable attention should be paid to this operation. If the enemy forces now control the air, the landing operation must be postponed. Sufficiently increase the number of aircraft, regain air control, and then implement it." I thus communicated with the headquarters.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 28th, I returned to Rabaul and was called to participate in the army-navy operations meeting. I attended with my body covered in blood. I thought that the United States had recovered its energy and should be paid close attention to. On August 1, I hurriedly returned from Rabaul to the General Headquarters and reported my feelings to my superiors. On the number I was in bed at the military medical school, I heard on the radio the news of the landing of our troops on Guadalcanal Island and the great battle results of our navy. By mid-September, I had recovered from my illness and went to Guadalcanal Island to avenge the enemy American forces. Because I was determined to overcome Guadalcanal Island, I took the most elite XX Brigade. The situation at that time was such that, due to enemy aircraft activity, it was absolutely impossible to approach Guadalcanal from the sky. We used destroyers to land soldiers at night, landing while it was still dark and moving away from the island. Because we only operated at night, it was called "Rat Transport." This was also dangerous, so we used small boats to transport along the island. This was like ants, so it was called "Ant Transport." So, although people could land, they could not transport bullets and food to the land. If bullets and food could not be transported to the land, it would be difficult to overcome the island. Therefore, we had to forcibly transport by transport ship? So, I took the opportunity to go to the Combined Fleet and earnestly pleaded with Commander-in-Chief Yamamoto. Commander Yamamoto replied: "Yes, I will go out personally. If necessary, I will steer the warship to Guadalcanal Island." I was very grateful. So, the transport ship, full of bullets and food, landed at Kamimpu on Guadalcanal Island on October 7.</p>
<p>The Tragic and Decisive Battle Situation on Guadalcanal Island</p>
<p>Guadalcanal Island was entirely covered by dense forests, with some coconut trees along the coast. We advanced towards the coconut trees on the front line. It so happened that a certain classmate from my officer candidate school was serving as a unit commander on the front line. I brought an orderly to meet him. When I met the unit commander on the front line, his eyes were sunken, his beard was long, and his military uniform was torn. I could not see the image of the unit commander who had landed on Corley Point and plunged into the enemy's airfield a month ago. Every time I went to battle, I carried this goblet. I poured some of the whiskey I brought from Rabaul into this goblet and urged him to drink, saying, "Excuse me, have a drink." Unit commander so-and-so, with tears in his eyes, ordered his subordinates to gather. About forty emaciated officers and non-commissioned officers smelled the aroma of the whiskey and drank a little. I reached into my pocket and took out the garlic candy I had brought from Tokyo and gave it to them to eat. The forty-odd people stretched out their hands to share it. I asked him how the battle was going. The unit commander smiled and said it was not a big deal. The American army was weaker than the Chinese soldiers. But there was no food. If there was food to eat, we could win with bayonets alone. When we plunged into the enemy airfield on the 15th of the month, one subordinate killed seven enemy soldiers, and stabbed enemy soldiers lying in the trenches from behind, resulting in at least three thousand. Although we seized the airfield, what could we do without anything to eat? One rice ball could last for three days, but that was not enough. If I had two more rice balls, I could secure the airfield. It was a pity that the support from the rear could not continue, resulting in great sacrifice. The fundamental problem was the airplanes, it was about air supremacy. At that time, compared to our combat power on the ground, the enemy was twice as strong as us, with ten times the artillery and twenty times the aircraft. Later, enemy aircraft bombed the headquarters, so it was decided to begin the general attack with the main force of XX Brigade. However, because the artillery was small, we could not achieve a significant effect from the front. It was decided to detour through the forest to the rear of the enemy army and carry out a night raid. So, from October 24 for five days, a great night raid was carried out. The enemy army had three hundred cannons, all firing at once. So-and-so, regardless of a fever above forty degrees, directed the battle in the trenches, while being injected by the military doctor and fighting. We still could not get food. We ate small coconut shoots called male coconuts, but they were as bitter as eating bamboo shoots. However, this was the only food. On October 30, news came from the front line that the enemy army would launch a major counterattack. The commander of the coastal area, Colonel So-and-so, resolved to call and say, "I will lead the remaining 150 soldiers and make a final attack on the army flag." I immediately stopped him and gathered the remaining three or five soldiers on duty and sent them to reinforce. In the meantime, about one hundred and fifty meters away from the headquarters, small guns approached, and the military commander and others were prepared to die. Fortunately, on November 7, we received the assistance of the new sharp brigade, which dealt a heavy blow to the enemy army and hindered its counterattack. In the meantime, due to the strategy of Navy Commander-in-Chief Yamamoto, we sank many enemy aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers in the sea north of Guadalcanal, avenging us.

<h3>Turkey Prioritizes National Interests, Will Not Fear War, Neutral Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 16th (Central News Agency) - Turkish parliamentarian Sadak published an editorial in the Yashengbao, entitled "Turkey Does Not Fear War," discussing the relationship of Anglo-Turkish negotiations. He stated that Turkey is prepared for a national war. Sadak said he does not believe that the negotiations have reached a deadlock, as reported by The Times of London. Turkey is currently facing extremely important issues, but it is not appropriate to discuss them publicly. He believes that Anglo-Turkish friendship, which is not based on deception and exploitation, will overcome all difficulties and find a way out of the current rumored state of stagnation. However, it is a complete fallacy to consider that the Turkish people can be driven by how others want them to obey. He refuted the statement by The Times that there is a great difference between the policies followed by the Turkish people and the Turkish government. The Turkish people do not know about the Anglo-Turkish negotiations as reported by The Times, but they expect the Turkish government to make decisions with broad vision. The Turkish government and people can make decisive decisions on the issue of Turkey's participation in the war, and if it is necessary to abandon neutrality, the Turkish people will support the government.</p>
<h3>US Air Force Destroys Ancient Monastery of Cassino</h3>
<p>Rome, 16th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: Yesterday, the aircraft of the US Fifth Army completely destroyed the monastery church on Mount Cassino.

The German authorities informed the agency that the destruction of the historical building would not affect the German army's determination to defend the city of Cassino.</p>
<h3>German Army on Eastern Front Repels Soviet Offensive</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced: (Northern Front) The main force of the Soviet offensive is concentrated on Narva.

The German army is firmly defending the line and has repelled the Soviet offensive. (Southern Front) The Soviet army gathered large forces in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River and launched an offensive southeast of Krivoy Rog, which failed. The Soviet army stubbornly attacked the German positions west of Cherkasy and east of Khershchkov, and fierce bayonet fighting broke out. The German army has repelled the Soviet forces. (Central Front) The Vitebsk area has once again become a battlefield of fierce fighting. The Soviet army is still attempting to break through the German positions southeast and northwest of the city, launching a large-scale mechanized battle. The German army's defense is solid and has repelled the Soviet forces.</p>

Minister Matsudaira previously served in Nanjing and provided many conveniences to the news community there. This time, he has come to Shanghai, is even more familiar with the situation in Shanghai, and will directly provide conveniences to our news community in the future. At the same time, the minister has always been deeply sympathetic to China and is also proficient in Chinese. We will not only have convenience in our work, but also have easier understanding in our opinions. In the future, he will guide our work even more conveniently. At this time, when the news community in this city is in a very difficult period, we always adhere to our beliefs, overcome difficulties, and hope that the relevant authorities will provide assistance in all aspects, such as the enthusiastic assistance of Minister Matsudaira.

<h3>Japanese Army Press Department Announces Burma War Situation and Analyzes US-Chongqing Air Force Situation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - The Shanghai Japanese Army Press Department held a routine meeting with the Shanghai Chinese News Reporters Corps at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Hua Hotel on the eighth floor. Lieutenant Sakamoto first gave a speech on the Burma war situation, followed by Mr. Akahoshi, Trustee, analyzing the US-Chongqing Air Force situation. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM. The content of their speeches is as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy Troops in Burma Encircled</p>
<p>Recently, British-Indian troops attempting to advance into Burma, in order to advance their aviation base in Htichauk and secure their attack base, launched a counteroffensive at the beginning of January. On January 13, they advanced into Buthidaung and Maungdaw. The enemy troops wanted to obtain the air force base in Htichauk, and they had to obtain the two bases of Buthidaung and Maungdaw before they could begin a counteroffensive. The Japanese army abandoned the Maungdaw area because it had no value in operations, and at the same time advanced south, loading defenses on Buthidaung and Maungdaw, to block the enemy's counteroffensive. The main force of the Japanese army advanced south along the Mayu River. On February 4, elite troops were positioned in Donbaik, and on the 8th, the main force was mobilized to break through the enemy's rear, tightly encircling the enemy troops. A fierce annihilation battle was launched against the 5th and 7th divisions of the enemy army gathered here. The enemy army was defeated and retreated, attempting to flee north on the left and right banks of the Mayu Mountains and the Naf River. After the Japanese army responded with air and land forces, the enemy troops were now in a desperate situation, and it was expected that the second Arakan disaster would be repeated.</p>
<p>General Situation of US-Chongqing Air Force</p>
<p>It is estimated that the strength of the US Air Force in Chongqing is about 200 fighters and bombers. From October of last year to the present, our side's war results (losses suffered by the enemy) have reached 240 US-Chongqing Air Force aircraft shot down and destroyed. As for why Chongqing currently has more than 200 aircraft, it is because they were recently transported from India and other places. Although the enemy's losses are heavy, we cannot be too optimistic about the future. The types of aircraft used by the US-Chongqing mixed unit include B24 bombers (four-engine), B25 bombers (medium, only two-engine), P40 fighters, P38 fighters, and those recently supplied to the coalition. These fighters are built by the US, have a range of 1,400 kilometers, a speed of 600 kilometers per hour, a height of 2,400 meters, and six 17mm machine guns. The above is a general overview of the US Air Force in Chongqing. As for the entire enemy US Air Force, there are currently fifteen divisions, of which the 1st to 4th divisions are stationed in the home country, the 5th division is in New Guinea, the 6th division is in Panama, the 7th division is around Hawaii, the 8th division is stationed in the British home country, the 9th division is in central and eastern Europe, the 10th division is still stationed in India, the 11th division is in the northern Aleutians, and the 13th division is in the Solomon Islands. The remaining 22nd, 15th, and 2nd divisions are in North Africa. The US Air Force 14th Air Force in Chongqing is not the entire force, but only a part extracted from it.</p>
<p>US Attempts Not Easy to Realize</p>
<p>US Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz once said: "Apart from using the Chinese mainland as a base to attack the Japanese home country, there is no other way." Therefore, the Japanese army is paying close attention to the activities of the US Air Force in Chongqing. In reality, the US is using island hopping operations to attempt to attack the Japanese home country, but in various situations, its unrealizability has already been revealed. I hope that the Chinese people can also pay attention to this major event.</p>
<p>According to completely verified intelligence: "The US in Chongqing has organized a 30th division, with US officers as the core and Chongqing troops as subordinates." Although its reality has not been fully verified, judging from the US's attempt to use Chongqing as a base to attack Japan, there may be some truth to it. Recently, it was also heard that the US Air Force Headquarters in Chongqing has advanced from Kunming to Guilin. But before they have any attempts, the elite Japanese air force in China will attack them and destroy all their facilities.</p>
<p>On the 13th of this month, when the enemy was using Jiangxi as an air force base and building an airfield, it had already been subjected to fierce bombing by the Japanese air force. Recently, the Japanese air force in China has gradually become stronger, and the military authorities have also acknowledged it. Recently, on January 29, the Chongqing correspondent for the New York Times cabled his home country: "The US Air Force in Chongqing is extremely fearful of the latest elite Japanese air force aircraft with the two characters 'Tojo' on them, because the performance of Japanese aircraft is extremely fast and the machines and combat are advanced." At the same time, US Senator Brewster also explained that "When the US Air Force in Chongqing encounters the latest Japanese air force aircraft, at least five out of seven US aircraft are shot down by Japanese aircraft." Apart from this, there are many other similar records.</p>
<p>The New York Times once载反轴心航空部队见日空军时，均光贝戒心，故　战屡北"云云。</p>
<p>The New York Times once reported that when the anti-Axis air force sees the Japanese air force, they are all wary, so the battles are often lost.</p>
<h3>Various People's Organizations Hold Informal Discussions</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - Various people's organizations in the city held an informal tea party to connect emotionally.

<h3>Tien Shang Tang's Cherished Collection: Charity Exhibition for Education Assistance: Opened Yesterday at the Chinese Painting Gallery</h3>
<p>The owner of Tien Shang Tang, Ke Tien-kuang-sheng, designated fourteen items from his collection, including jade artifacts from three dynasties, a bronze seal of Han Hsin, and paintings from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, to be used for educational assistance. This had been published in the "Education Assistance" column of the Shen Bao, seeking enthusiastic individuals to be the first to come forward to contribute to this good cause. The exhibition opened on the 15th at the Chinese Painting Gallery. The paintings, calligraphy, and antiques on display are mostly rare treasures. The items specifically for educational assistance are even more precious and difficult to acquire. For example, the excavated jade artifacts from three dynasties are dazzlingly brilliant. The handle bears the two characters "Nai Sun Zhi Ding Wen," and not only is the craftsmanship of the characters exquisite and pleasing to the eye, making viewers linger and reluctant to leave, but it is also a mixture of bone white, mercury, lime, mottled and colorful, shining brightly. Onlookers were amazed. Furthermore, there is a bronze seal of the Han Three Kings, Han Hsin, in the shape of an inverted dou, with Han dynasty patterns on the top of the seal. The bronze has rusted, turning into red spots, and the character "Hsin" also has traces of soil erosion, undoubtedly proving that it is Han Hsin's private seal. Three or five guests in the gallery chatted and praised it as a spectacle. In addition, there are ancient paintings such as Yu Kuang-yin's Flowers and Birds from the Tang dynasty, Shi Hsien-tsu's Beauty and Jade Rabbit from the Song dynasty (inscribed by Yi Ping-shou), Chao Qian-li's Afang Palace Map from the Song dynasty (bearing the seal of the Song Longtu Pavilion), Chao Zi-ang's Yuan Ming Story Album from the Yuan dynasty (treasured by Qian Shu-shi and Xiang Zi-jing), a Yuan dynasty imitation of Song dynasty monk Fa-chang's Cypress Ape Painting (paper-based, treasured by Huang Pang-da), Chu Te-jun's landscape from the Yuan dynasty (dated as being made during the Shun Emperor's Jun Ping Yuan era), and Xia Di's Hidden Residence in Huayang from the Yuan dynasty. The ink has blossomed, and the upper end has a Yuan official's jade seal. The cursive signature is also unique, very similar to the Yuan dynasty Bao seal style. Others include Shi Tao's rough mountains and fine people, colored bamboo, Shi Xi's landscape, Wang Lianzhou's landscape (titled by Lu Lian-qu-jian), and a pair of mirror frames depicting the German Qing dynasty official Tang Rou-wang's Feeding Birds and Washing Dogs, which are even rarer and more widely taught in China than those of Giuseppe Castiglione. Furthermore, there are two albums of Shen Quan, also known as Qing Lai, depicting the entire view of Huangshan and the full view of famous scenic spots. According to history, Shen Quan, who came from Tianjin during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, only created the entire view of Huangshan, which he made with Mo Kui-zhai while traveling in his old age. Now, looking at the full album and the inscription on the first page, it confirms the origin and is consistent with history, making it truly a unique copy. It is said that the exhibition will end on the 21st and will not be extended. Those who are interested in education assistance and antiquities can achieve both in one fell swoop. Please do not miss this opportunity.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Special Municipality First District Public Office Proclamation No. 191</h3>
<p>(Regarding the Quality Standards for Egg Powder and Egg Flakes)</p>
<p>Proclamation: Regarding all egg powder and egg flake products, it is now stipulated that the free fatty acid (oleic acid) content within the oil must not exceed 7%.

Proclaimed on February 17, 33rd year of the Republic of China, concurrently by Director Chen Kung-po.</p>
<h3>Where Has the Floating Capital Gone?</h3>
<p>The wartime economy of Shanghai presents a most contradictory picture. Any plan or countermeasure, once applied to Shanghai, invariably produces the opposite result. One need only look at how much higher the black market price of cotton yarn is than before the acquisition, how much higher the black market price of rice is than before the control, and how much higher the black market prices of oil, sugar, matches, soap, and all other daily necessities are than before rationing to understand the abnormal state of the Shanghai market. In particular, the hoarding trend since the Lunar New Year has never been so rampant before or so late, yet it is rampant during the last period of the year. After Finance Minister Zhou instructed to tighten financial lending to prevent spring hoarding, it makes one feel that "governing is not about talking too much," because the lure of profit has completely deafened the general profiteers.</p>
<p>We have spoken repeatedly about the destination of floating capital, but it is unthinkable that the opening of the "Year of Increased Production" is "hoarding"! Our criticism of floating capital flowing into stock speculation is still fresh, yet there is now a more severe and widespread hoarding than stock speculation. No wonder everyone knows where the floating capital has gone in the recent period of sluggish stock market conditions. It should be known that stock speculation, while suicidal in its result, still benefits production to some extent if it is invested in legitimate production securities. As for hoarding speculation, it is not only suicidal, but also suicidal with no way back to life, because investing in hoarding, no matter how it is explained, does not contribute to production. At most, it is a way for individuals to make money, but when one person gets rich while everyone else gets poor, the result will inevitably be endless price increases, people unable to make a living, and resorting to desperate measures. This will not only become the most serious problem of livelihood, but also the most serious problem of public order. The relevant authorities should take precautions and act decisively, lest it become a stage III lung disease that is incurable!</p>
<h3>First District Economic Office Strengthens Investigative Work: Cracking Down on Violations of Regulations</h3>
<p>Since the spring, prices in the city have fluctuated sharply, causing unrest among the people. The reporter made a special visit to the person in charge of the Economic Office of the First District Public Office, who revealed the inside story of the recent price fluctuations. Although it is complex and confusing, the profiteering of unscrupulous merchants is indeed a major cause. Since the investigation and enforcement section of this office was ordered to be abolished, there have been rumors that this office will temporarily suspend the crackdown on prices, which is a misunderstanding. In order to strengthen the investigation mechanism, this office has decided to hand over the investigation work directly to the responsible departments in order to expedite matters. This measure has already been investigated and is now being implemented. Starting today, investigations of companies and shops will commence, and if any violations of economic regulations are found, they will be severely punished without leniency.</p>
<h3>National Policy Companies Continue to Adjust</h3>
<p>The various national policy companies under the China Central Reconstruction Corporation system, with the exception of the Silk Company, which has been dissolved, and the Jianye Company, whose Japanese shares have been completely transferred to the Chinese side, the remaining twelve companies (China Central Mining, China Central Hydropower, Inland River Shipping, Wireless Communications, China Central Public Bus, China Central Aquatic Products, Greater Shanghai Gas, Huainan Coal Mine, China Central Railway, China Shipyard, China Central Transportation, and China Central Match) will all be adjusted in line with the needs of the new Sino-Japanese economic strategy. The principles followed are roughly as follows: Those related to military operations will continue to adopt the previous method. Those related to the livelihood of the Chinese people will be handled by the Chinese side, and to the extent that their efficiency can be expected to increase, they will be managed by the Chinese as much as possible. Regarding other aspects, efforts will be made to strengthen national capital and cooperation from the Chinese side to promote smooth economic operation and increased productivity. The specific methods of adjustment are roughly divided into five points: Dissolution, Transfer, Revision of Capital Structure, Revision of Personnel Structure, and Revision of Preferential Treatment for National Policy Companies.</p>

<h3>Message to Japanese Nationals: The Most Brilliant Military Operations</h3>
<p>I returned to Japan under orders. En route to the coast, on a certain river bank a soldier, his mess kit empty, drank from the water, looked at me fearfully, and said, "Staff Officer, in my pack I have a savings account book, which I offer to the government, so airplanes may be built." And with that he died. Probably that soldier was from a family of poor circumstances, and was survived by elderly parents. He clutched this passbook tightly in his pack. Nearing death, he expressed no bitterness or dissatisfaction, but instead offered his savings to make airplanes. The reinforcement unit that had come to our aid had been fighting with our army in a town that was under attack. The new arrivals were battle-hardened, and had brought with them some rations. For a period of two-and-a-half months, although our supply routes had been cut off by the enemy, this unit fought to the death. For example, gathering up the few rations that were available amongst surviving comrades, and apportioning it as one week's worth of rice, they formed squads of three or five soldiers to conduct operations in secret, sneaking into the forests and blowing up the enemy airfield, or heavy gun emplacements, or diving into the enemy headquarters to assassinate their commander. Day and night, groups of three or five soldiers snuck into the forests to assault the enemy. Returning to the main force, I reported to headquarters on this matter. While this was happening, the command unit on Guadalcanal sent a telegram, saying, "Supplies of food have been exhausted. There is no more moss, and the coconuts and sprouts on the palms have all been consumed. However, we still have bayonets and guns. The commander has ordered all remaining troops to fight to the death. Do not concern yourself." Nowhere in the telegram did they request bullets or rice. When Japanese troops depart to clear and secure, they often encounter American soldiers in the dense jungle. While the Americans may have ten men, and the Japanese have only two, the American soldiers will throw down their rifles and run. They will never conduct a night attack, and will never enter the Japanese positions, but will shell us from a distance with bombs and machine guns, never showing their faces. The troops of Chongqing are very different, as they send their officers out in front when they attack. I have personally experienced this on several occasions. American soldiers rely on their superior equipment, and will only shell us with artillery, naval guns, and bombs, but they will never resort to the bayonet. That is their true disposition. Regarding the military operations on Guadalcanal, because the terrain was so bad, and heavy losses were being incurred, it was determined that rebuilding the base there was unwise, and the decision was made to reestablish the base elsewhere. Thinking logically, no soldiers caught on this island could escape the bombs of the airplanes, but on February 1st of last year, no soldiers were lost, and they were able to redeploy. Three days after the redeployment, an American broadcast announced that "The Japanese are showing signs of retreat, and the American army will now begin to pursue them." At that time, not a single Japanese soldier remained on the island. It was truly like the dead Zhuge Liang scaring away the living Sima Yi.</p>
<p>The Incomparable Fighting Spirit of the Japanese Army: During those six months of fighting and hardship, not one soldier complained to the commander, or to any of his superior officers. This is because the commander, the staff, and the troops were all in the same situation, and endured the airplane attacks and lack of rations together. As everyone knows, after the military operations on Guadalcanal had concluded, in New Guinea and in the Solomon Islands, the enemy was attacking with ten times our numbers. The same was true on the Gilbert and Marshall Islands. But taking a closer look, how far have they actually progressed in these two years? Recently, the enemy launched a coordinated attack on the tiny islet of Udot in the Marshalls. But in the meantime, the enemy had lost at least twenty divisions of soldiers, and the loss of battleships, aircraft carriers, and at least half of the Pacific Fleet. They had made such heavy sacrifices, but had only managed to seize a few uninhabited islands. Conversely, the battle record of the Japanese army since the beginning of the war has been to seize Singapore, Java, Sumatra, sever Burma, and control New Guinea. Simultaneously, in China, they are restricting the activities of the American air force. Comparing the military records and losses of the first six months of the war with the records and losses of the last two years, it is very clear how the war will unfold. This war will progress in the same fashion. An American soldier cannot withstand more than four months on the battlefield, and must ask to be replaced. The Japanese soldier, whether it is two years, or three years, or until the very last soldier, will continue without complaint, and without bitterness. From this point of view, as this war drags on, the American army will be forced to surrender, and has already been defeated in spirit. What is the source of the Japanese soldier's terrifying bravery and indomitable spirit? Ultimately, it is not due to the power of individual Japanese, but is rooted in the national polity. The Tenno Cup (at this moment, the Colonel showed the audience the Tenno Cup) has been kept in my pocket during every one of the last ten battles. During difficult or critical moments, or when facing exhausted soldiers, I have often comforted and encouraged with this Tenno Cup. I cannot count how many times this has been. From the commander to the lowest private, we are all inspired by this Imperial Cup. There is no other reason, but only that we were born into this national polity, and we gladly die in service of the Emperor.

<h3>Cold Clothing Production Will Be Completed Soon: Scheduled to End This Month</h3>
<p>This office cooperated with the Buddhist Congee Kitchen last winter to organize the production of cold clothing. It is admirable that kind-hearted people from all walks of life actively ordered clothes to benefit the poor. Due to the large number of items and insufficient materials, the distribution has been delayed repeatedly. The production of cold clothing is scheduled to be completed on the 20th of this month. In order to complete the closing procedures, please collect them from this office within this month.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Yang</p>
<p>(4) Turtle Sea</p>
<p>Thus, the nickname "Sea Turtle" unknowingly spread among the platoons. "Sea Turtle" was the naval epithet for early submarines—a simple, crude, small vessel with a crude gasoline engine, struggling to submerge into the water, reminiscent of a person learning to swim. However, this nickname became widely recognized among the students during the pole-grabbing event.</p>
<p>Pole-grabbing was one of Etajima's major events. It was held every Saturday, and fourth-grade students initially only watched from the sidelines. Jinren believed that pole-grabbing was like the "general-snatching" games in his hometown, but with the general replaced by a pole. In particular, it not only compared strength but also utilized so-called strategic and ingenious teamwork, which was progressive. In short, he had confidence in his skills from his time in Kagoshima, so he quietly awaited the opportunity to participate, and that moment finally arrived.</p>
<p>However, when the starting trumpet sounded, he felt a tremor through his entire body. He had just returned from the restroom and already felt the urge to urinate again. Because pole-grabbing was the most intense of all the competitions at the naval academy, it seemed like a manifestation of the spirit of absolute victory, which he had often witnessed. In the case of the opposing side, even upperclassmen could be beaten, rammed, and kicked at will. In short, it was a kind of group fight. Speaking of fighting, Jinren had never experienced it in his life, so while he hoped to participate in this competition, he also felt uneasy in his heart.</p>
<p>Soon, all the platoons were divided into odd and even groups, centered around tall poles bearing red and white flags. Six-foot-tall men formed a main formation to guard the inner circle. Around them, small soldiers like Jinren formed a team to guard the outer circle, and the attack team would block the enemy's advance along the way. This was the defense force. Our attacking force consisted of advanced swordsmen and jujutsu practitioners, bravely charging into the enemy's main formation, climbing on enemies to seize the pole, or diving underneath to pull up the pole's roots. Both sides wore thick canvas pole-grabbing uniforms, a brave attire with bare feet and no hats.</p>
<p>"Start pole-grabbing!" The physical education director, holding a military fan, gave this order, and at the same time, the trumpet sounded. Our attack team ran like released birds, and at a certain distance, they encountered the enemy's attack team, so our roving team began to fiercely defend.</p>
<p>"(Go for it! Go for it!)" Jinren was stunned as he watched. At that moment, someone struck him on the head with a thud.</p>
<p>"What are you doing!" The usually mild-mannered Jinren couldn't help but become angry. He turned around and saw that someone with the enemy's badge had run up to him. Jinren thought deeply about retaliating, pulling back his hand to strike him in return, but he suddenly stopped. Perhaps if he did, a corner of the outer circle's defenses would collapse – someone started laughing loudly, and suddenly, he was drawn back into the laughter.</p>
<p>"That guy, after all, is a sea turtle. He's diving down again today and has made a great contribution..."</p>
