<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論糧食問題</h3>
<p>我們感於近日米價黑市的跳躍不已，認爲糧食問題的嚴重危機正方興未艾，如不切實檢討過去失敗癥結，針對現實環境，亟謀治標治本兼施方策，則民生用厄將更甚於今日，實未可等閑視之。</p>
<p>本月二日社評，我們會以「請求政府獎勵農業生產」爲題，指出農民對於種植食糧，抱具猶豫態度，交織着舉棋不定的選擇心理，可能發生兩種結果，第一是减少種稻面積，逃避低價收買的虧蝕。第二是縱然種稱，也是消極，不肯勤於耕耘。這兩種結果，都造成糧食減產的局面。因此，我們主張：　禁止軍隊直接向農民收買米糧，軍需用米由統一機關以合理價格統收統給。減少農民心理上的恐慌。　收買米糧，必須計算農民成本，酌加合理利潤，减少農民心理上低價的刺激。　軍米以外之民食米親，鑒於過去的痛苦經騐，值得重加檢討與考慮。</p>
<p>又本月九日社評，再以「糧食問題的考慮時機」爲題，檢討過去糧政的失敗，考慮今後應趨的方向。我們所以一再提出糧食問題者，嚴重的說，民生問題中以糧食為首要，糧食問題不能解決，民生安定無從談起，民生不能安定達到某種程度時，農邨固然紊亂，都市益見枕隍，勢將形成一幅人爲饑荒的大流民圖。試瞑目一想，這是何等可怕的</p>
<p>我們並無新異的見解，祇就過去所主張的複述如次：</p>
<p>目前最迫切的，希望當局從速頒布獎勵農民種植米糧辦法。程極的使農民種植米糧有利可圖，自動增加耕種面積與產量。消極的不再以一成不變的價格，強制收買。同時。利用荒地，移流民從事墾植。</p>
<p>在此戰時，軍米第一，自無疑義，但應由中央政府負全責供應，資成地方（縣）政府會同當地米商擔任收買工作，顧到農民成本與合理利潤，並隨物價情形變動收買價格。二方面農民納賦，可試辦征收實物。地方政府如辦理著有成績，予以獎勵；辦理不力或作弊者，予以嚴懲。</p>
<p>上海市食米問題，據日前市政諮詢委員會招待新聞界消息中，已經擬成解決方案待呈市長核定。我們盼望市當局暨該會從速實現切實易行的措施。同時，盟邦當局的協力，尤感必要。相信盟邦當局對於糧食問題的重要性，早巳深切瞭解，而不致輕視。此外，米商的放棄私利，從旁協力，也極重要。羣策羣力，共挽狂瀾，此其時矣。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>獻穀報獎金制度</h3>
<p>現在米田每段（三百方步，每步六平方尺）的收入，全國平均每段收　量以二石計，爲百廿五圓。而種植果樹蔬菜，一段的收入往往達數百圓以上。所以米作的收入比較利少。政府雖在二三年前即已獎勸改變作物，可是，旅行者每處可見平地的中央部分依然栽植蜿蜒不絕的果樹國。農家的所以不肯變換作物，地方當局的所以不能使令農家變換作物，實因有米作利少的經濟因素在。栽植不急要的作物，不僅土地被佔，而且吸收了貴重的肥料與勞力。由於此次的供出報獎金及獎勵金制度之實施，供出米可能增加若干？農民願否減少種植果樹，而改種稻作，雖尚未可知，但能因此而多少見之實施，已是幸事了。</p>
<p>况且全國各地農村，本有採代用食糧的習慣。由於此次制度的實施，因須儘量供出米糧，而能遂漸恢復這舊習慣，亦是可喜的傾向。所以，此次報獎金每石規定付給七十五圓至百圓，不可　為過多。</p>
<p>然而，引起了許多杞憂，以爲或將發生農村通貨膨脹。但這是不足爲憂的，農村中雖有了錢，但可買的物資則較少。所以餘剩的資金幾完全貯蓄起來。事實上，以貯蓋報國者，沒有更甚於農村了。假使爲了防止戰時通貨膨脹，而要求協力，應住意於支出經費最多的財政方面，和繁榮的產業關係。在該方面力謀節約，勿使輕視金錢，濫耗經費。不過此次供出來的事先規定定額的方法，根據過去的成績與統計而決定，漠視最近的傾向，定出與現實收穫大不相符的數字，那是很感困難的。</p>
<p>其次，怎樣使支配食糧生產的有力材料如耕地之增加，肥料與勞力的滅少，在規定定額時預爲打算，亦爲問題，而最重大的則爲氣候與災害。關於這幾點，在採用實際的定額方法時，排除地方上有力人士的惡意破壞運動，削除農村中不平的因素，同為當局最須注意之點。農　省在過去的成績上考慮現在的情形，而規定各府縣的定額，自極妥善。但担任實際工作者則爲府縣當局。所以這制度的效能如何，全視府縣當局的努力為衡，地方長官的任務可說愈趨重大。我們不禁盼望地方當局的自重與努力。（翔：譯自五月一日日本　　報知）</p>
<h3>日首相披瀝決意　完遂大東亞戰爭　國民總崛起大會盛况空前</h3>

<h3>東條首相演辭要旨</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　東條首相演說要旨如次：綜觀現時戰局　　太平洋緬甸中國方面各戰綫，由於日軍英勇善戰，東亞戰局實正突入決戰時期。日本對處此嚴里之戰局，自開戰以來二年有半時期中，得以利用中日滿以及南方各地資源，使軍需物資澈底自足自給，使飛經生產儀於戰前未曾想到之數量。此外食糧之自給。人力之動員。精神之上下一心。實力之優越，皆足以當擊滅英美之大任。於茲國家緊急之今日，已痛感一億國民之崛起團結之必要，以期集總力於戰勝一途。國民運動之要締，爲期喚發國民之忠誠心，而將此推展發楊之。本乎此，故凡當局者，務須中於職守，同時立於指導國民之立塲者，必須將此大義滲入人心，以期國民之真聲，於施政上有所反映，務必深體國家之信義，忍受一切艱苦，爲我大東亞十億民族奮鬥。我等一億國民欲建此大業，唯有潵底國結，始能將大東亞之總力發揮無餘。所謂最後隊利，乃視我國民之戰鬥意志如何而定，如能克服一切艱苦，必可操致勝敗之關鍵。於今日絕不在物質，唯有賴最堅絕之精神力，方能決定。</p>
<h3>豫日軍對洛陽　取包圍形勢　打通平漢綫告成</h3>
<p>蘇黎世十四日中央社電路透社重慶電，河南戰棧日軍，正由四面向洛陽猛進中。該市之陷落，已成時問問題。日軍一前進部隊，已進迫洛陽八公里之地點云。</p>
<p>中央社滬訊渝軍事委員會發言人，十二日會見記者團稱：「日軍此次在河南作戰，已將平漢綫打通成功，故日軍已達成將該路綫一帶渝軍遠驅往西方山岳地帶之目的。」又關於平漢綫打通後之戰局，駐渝外國記者觀測，日軍刻將該戰綫中心移至洛陽方面，該地現已全爲日軍包圍，其陷落僅爲時間問題。</p>
<p>洛陽附近敵機受挫</p>
<p>新鄭十四日中央社電隧着河南南作戰之進展，美駐渝空軍及渝方空軍，亦漸次活躍。尤以日軍攻略許昌後，其來襲更形頻仍。但此項敵機迭經日機邀擊，已蒙重創。如十二日上午，日軍某部隊在洛陽附近，以機槍擊落其P49型機三架，十二日上午十時四十五分，又在洛陽附近邀擊來襲之敵P49型機五架，當即擊落其中一架。又是日下午又有敵P40型機十餘榮來襲洛陽附近，但經日軍邀擊即擊落其二架，其餘敵機見勢不佳，即行遁走。</p>
<h3>日機襲韶州</h3>
<p>廣州十四日中央社電　日機會於十二日上午入時五十分，轟炸廣東省北部要衝韶州，於韶州東站附近投下巨彈，並使其軍事　施及軍需倉庫二處起火。嗣後日機全部安返基地。</p>
<p>美機襲漢</p>
<p>英口十四日中央社電駐渝美空軍爲掩飾敗戰，會於十三日下午三時十五分，以中型機榮來襲漢口，盲投彈數枚，即行遁走。所投燒夷彈當即熄滅，陸上未受何等損失云。</p>
<h3>實部發還鎭句　民營蠶種塲</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　實業部爲發還前華中蠶絲公司交還之江蘇省丹徒縣四擺渡·高資鎮·及句容縣·橋頭鎮·各民營蠶種製造造塲，特訂定暫行辦法，業經部令公布施行。據悉：於各原業主或委託代理人申請發還時，應擬具復業計劃及所有權契據，蠶種製造塲許可證，股更名冊等證明文件。檢同呈部查核，倘如遣失後取具地方主管機關，或同業公會之證明書，呈送實業部查核，經該部審查認爲合格後，原業主或代理人，須分登南京·上海·蘇州·三地日報各三天，聲明產權，如無人提出異議，始得潑還。且發還以後，應由業主呈報所在地縣政府，層轉行政院備案，而在該部代爲保管期內所發生之一切費用，則由原業主。或委託代理人，按照行政院核定之數額償還。至申請發還日期。自登報公告日起三個月爲限，該項民營蠶種製造塲全部交還後，對於我國蠶絲事業前途，深信定有更進一步之發展。</p>
<h3>實部農林署　推廣植蔴</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　實業部農林署，自成立以來，對於各項增產事業，積極推進，不遣餘力。茲復以蔴類作物，用途日廣，而極易生殖，尤適於新墾肥沃之土地。爰於本年度起，在江寗縣屬大勝關，設置蔴作試騐塲，闢地二百畝，事作試騐工作，以為增產之本。復繁殖優良蔴種，就現在試騐具有成效之黃蔴洋蔴，積極加以繁殖。指定農林署堯化門，秣陸關，江浦各，第七，第十二各林懇示範塲，及第二育苗塲，每處劃定三十至五十畝，專作試騐之用。至於蔴作之推廣工作，則於蘇浙皖二省及京滬兩特別市，分別</p>
<h3>汪委長派代表　致祭樺島顧問　追悼儀式簡單肅穆</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　全國經濟委員會顧問樺島千春，受聘來華，已歷三年。對於我國經濟建設，卓著勳勤。不幸於本月十日下午七時，積勞病故，我國朝野上下，皆深悼惜。茲悉國府主席兼全國經濟委員會汪委員長，特派該會　秘書長敬芳，於十四日上午十一時致祭，儀式簡單肅穆。</p>
<h3>日興亞使節　訪滿要人</h3>
<p>新京十四日中央社電　日訪滿興亞使節伍堂氏一行，昨晨九時參拜新京神社忠靈塔後，即訪問　津關東軍司令官·張國務總理，武部總務長官等，並參拜建國神社忠靈塔，十一時五十入分訪問協和會三宅中央本部部長，就興亞運動事有所懇談，嗣即訪簡市公署，下午六時並出席小日山滿鐵總裁之招待宴。</p>
<h3>比先波爾南方　正展開激戰　襲緬敵機被擊落六架</h3>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　加爾各答來電：日軍與英印軍會在此先波爾南方加鮑特桑加姆之小村中，激戰達十二次。</p>
<p>仰光十四日中央社電　日機於十一日上午會與侵人某地區之美火箭式，P38型戰鬥機北美式P51型戰鬥機及超高速度戰鬥機共十二架，展開激烈之空戰，結果共擊落其六架。</p>
<h3>北千島列島　防務堅強無比　敵妄圖侵犯必遭不幸</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　美國在西南太平洋及中部太平洋如瘋如狂，一再反攻，但迄今仍僅佔得日本外廓防衛一端之三數小島而已，其反攻作戰之目的，當然係在攻至日本內廓防衛綫，甚至日本本土，在此種意義上，當前美國對日本北千島所作之侵略作戰，實應汪目。按自日軍於基斯加島撤退以來，迄今已入閱月，雙方對峙，遲遲不進，美國何以竟如此沉悶，此不可不謂爲北千島列島防衛堅固之功。蓋北千島列島防務有四種偉大要塞，其一，爲得狂風厲雪天時之冰雪要塞，其二，爲得險礁奴流地利之水際要塞，其三，爲以機械化陸地機動部隊形成之機械化要塞，其四，爲設備完全勢力雄厚之空軍要塞。有此四種要塞，敵軍之所以於將近一年中，只能從事偵察工作，自亦屬情理。就該方面之防衛言，美軍實應及早斷絕妄念，如果再逞其意氣企圖侵攻，則將遭遇影饗全面反攻而一蹶不振之重大打擊也。</p>
<h3>甘地夫人　慰靈祭</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電日國民同志會生辦之甘地夫人慰靈祭，今日下午一時半於此間西本願寺內舉行，出席者除在東京之印度人及回敎協會會昌數百人，日情報局天羽總裁。本莊繁陸軍大將。及各界人士約一千五百人均行參加。</p>
<h3>外部招待外賓　遊覽玄武湖</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電日來天郎氣淸，惠風和暢，最宜郊遊。外交部特於今日下午三時，在玄武湖招待在京各國外賓遊春，怡情于山光水色之中。計到有日本谷大使，淸水書記官，松村參事官，太田參事官夫婦，石黑秘書官夫人。德國韋爾曼大使，博凌秘書，艾樂文秘書，北京中德學會霍福民博士。滿大使館張參事官，丁秘書官，劉秘書官，西村輔佐管，法國領事館薩查德總領事夫婦。由我外交部褚部長大婦，陳駐滿大使，張公使，張參事，范司長，徐司長等殷勤招待。各部院長官亦多蒞臨作陪。三時正，各外賓絡繹抵達湖演，乘興遊覽湖景，旋赴迎紫堂休息，並觀覽我國術表演。一時佳賓雲集，情緒熱烈異常，誠極一時之盛。</p>
<h3>義南採取攻勢　歐陸大戰先聲　雙方增援戰事益激烈</h3>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　海通社訊：義前綫英美軍開始大規模進攻，似爲歐陸大戰之先聲。德軍司令部昨日宣稱，「此項進攻具有牽製及　優敵軍之目的，」蓋並不視爲單獨之軍事行動也。義國戰事應視爲關係反軸心軍進攻歐陸之計劃，德軍司令部以爲英美空軍加緊空襲西歐德佔領區，爲「進攻歐陸之準備」。反軸心軍進攻義南，顯欲分散德軍司令部對海峽及大西洋岸之注意，抽調該處德軍赴義南，而反軸心飛機加緊空襲法南岸，亦頗堪注意。義國戰事尚無明顯之作戰中心，反軸心軍或擬在卞西諾南北兩面，採取鉗形戰略，亦未可知。敵方已增派生力軍，德軍亦增加預備隊，戰事益趨劇烈</p>
<p>賴比特河殺氣甚濃</p>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　據德方推測反軸心軍在此次攻勢中所使用之兵力，約有四師乃至五師，全員約爲六革乃至七萬五千人。綜合前錢報告，戰鬥係在卡西諾至第勒尼安海約三十里之地帶展開。反軸心軍利用舟艇及浮橋，渡過賴比特河後，復由格斯塔夫綫之外廓綫，追迫德軍。</p>
<h3>西歐各地　連日遭空襲</h3>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　德元首行營公報稱：美轟炸機大編隊於十二日白晝轟炸德東部，雖蒙若干損害，但來襲之敵機中，有九十一架被擊落。其中五十入架爲四引擎轟炸機。十二日夜英空軍曾以小隊來襲德北部海岸及比利時數地區，德夜間戰鬥隊當擊落某四引鑿機十三架。最近反軸心軍速續空襲西歐佔領地區顯爲登陸作戰之前奏。</p>
<h3>華萊士　將啟程訪渝</h3>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　據華農頓電：美副總統華萊士，最近即將啟程訪渝，傳渠於訪渝後，更擬訪問印度與蘇聯。</p>
<h3>華中一帶船舶　航行規程修正　雙方當局發表談話</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電欲使物資來源得以暢通無阻，其先決條件，乃爲遝輸問題須有合理解决。查華中一帶水路交通向稱便利，故一般物資之運職，其仰賴於船舶者正多。事變以後，盟邦陸海軍當局，對我華中方面之船舶航行，會訂立管理規程，加以管理。實施以來，於整個之航運運營，收效殊宏。茲者我國府當局，爲求進一步確立戰時運輸體制，乃迭與盟邦陸海軍當局協商，擬將上述船舶航行規程，酌予修改，以適應實際情勢。乃承盟邦當局誠意援助，磋商結果，決自本月十五日起，正式改正施行。即將以前所　限制輸送物資，及輸送人員之規程，槪予撤廢。指定三十噸以下之民舶，可自由航行揚子江及內河，無須請領航行許可證。至三十噸以上之航船，並已加入華中航船（戎克）協會，或華中內河民船公會爲會員者，則在揚子江及內河內，原則上亦無須領證。如航行沿海岸一帶，則須向海軍方面請領許可證。又今後即對於其他船舶，請領許可證之手續，亦較前更形簡單。如有不合法令規定之各種私運，以及防碍治安之各種航行，則仍隨時竭力防止。深信經此次修正後，今後之船舶航行，完能因限制放寬，而其數量必能增多。因此航運問題，自當更趨於合理圓滑，其裨益於國計民生者，至鉅且大。進而因航運之圓滑，當更可促使物資交流之暢通。故此項航行規程之修正，直接固可改善航運，間接更有助於物資交流，安定民生之大業。我人於熱烈期待之餘，尤對盟邦陸海軍當局真摯協助之誠意，深表感佩。行政院周副院長及日大使館當局，昨特分別發表重要談話，關述此舉之意義。並深盼全應船民，共體斯旨，協力完遂當局改善航運之意旨。</p>
<p>周副院長談話</p>
<p>華中一帶水路交通向稱便利，故物資運輸，多賴船舶。此次經與盟邦陸海軍當局協商，多蒙竭力誠意援助，央定將華中方面一般船舶航行統制規程，加以修正。自五月十五日起施行，此後船舶旣可增多，轍送自更圓滑，裨益民生良非淺鮮，其修正要點如下。　凡以前所訂限制轍送物資及輸送人員之規程撤發之，改依一般規則辦理。　暫行對於三十噸以下之民船，毋須請領許可體，得自由航行揚子江及內河。　對於三十噸以上之航船，其已加入華中我克（航船）協會，或華中內河民船總會者，航行揚子江及內河時，原則上得免領航行許可蹬。如以會員船航行沿海岸一帶，則應向海軍方面請領許可證。　對於其他船舶，發給航行許可證，將更形簡單化，俾增進航運之效率。</p>
<p>國民府對於邦陸海軍當局此項援助之賢明措置，至表欽佩。此後因航運之圓滑，當更努力促使物資流通，民生安定　凡足以妨得航運之各種措置。未經呈准之各種捐稅等，均將通飭取消，並嚴予取締。</p>
<p>同時對於不合法令規定之各種私運，以及妨碍治安之各種航行，則仍竭力防止。一經查出，當一律從嚴處罰。</p>
<p>日大使館談話</p>
<p>日駐華陸海軍當局，於昨發表改訂「統制華中方面一般船舶航行規程」對一般船舶之航行統制，天加緩和。其改訂要點有四：（已見周副院長談話規程，此固爲日軍當局體恤民情，另一方面則係一般人民努力維特治安所致。深願一般船戶今後爲酬謝日軍當局此種厚意，深體改訂本規程之趣旨，實獻增强運輸並協力確保治安，勿輸送利敵物資或走私，以完成大東亞戰爭。</p>
<p>民船總會負責人談</p>
<p>我國當局此次與盟邦常局議定改訂「華中方面一般船舶航行統制規程」後，裨益於物資之輸送及民生之安定殊多。記者頃時訪華中內河民船總命負責人，承就此事談稱：「我國與盟邦當局，此次商訂修正一般船舶統制，實爲極賢明之措置，根擄最近調查，華中一帶之民船總計入萬八千八百九十五隻，共五十四萬二千三百六十噸，以經營此項船舶爲生之男女達三十二萬六千人之多，過去因統制甚嚴，航業不能充分發展，今後得自由航行。則此數十萬人之生活，可告安定，而貢獻於物資之流通及國家經濟之建設，以　於大東亞戰爭之完遂尤多，誠不勝欣慰期待也。</p>

<h3>當局積極增強　物資統治機構將設物價管理對策委員會</h3>
<p>國府當局自實實戰時經濟政策，成立物資統制審議委員會，責成全國商業統制總會實行全國物資統制任務以來，已週一戲，經過成績，尙朱能達到理想目的。故爲完成統治任務，以期物資供需平衡計，對於統制機構，積極從事加强，其各種與民生有關主要物賢統制澈底調整，現正與有關方而研究澈底調整物資統制收配整個方策，一面準備組設物價管理對策委員會，公平協定物價統一營運，同時注目於緊急增加生產云</p>
<h3>四屆中小學運動會　昨舉行揭幕禮　參加者八十餘校盛極一時</h3>
<p>本市之第四屆全市中小學聯合運動大會，於昨（十四）日上午十時，在虹口北四川路底虹口公園，舉行揭籲典禮。到有敎育部趙次長，大會副會長市敎育局長林烱庵，市府參事潘達，全國體育協會沈嗣良，及奚培文等，均蒞臨指導。大會全體職員及各校運動員八千人。十時正，揭幕典禮開始。會塲佈置至爲整齊，開會奏樂後，升旗，全體運動員在軍樂洋溢聲中，繞塲一週，各學校均以旗幟前導，隨風飄揚，燦爛奪目，至司令台前。全體肅立，行禮如儀，全體向東遙向　汪主席致敬。大會副會長林主席，報吿開會意義，敎育部趙次長·潘達·沈嗣良等相繼致訓，全體唱運動會歌，各校聯合大會操，並由社會福利部人口署第二處長　舜華領導表演簡易體操，旋即運動開始：</p>
<p>主席報告</p>
<p>略謂：「今天舉行全市第四屆中小學運動大會會長陳市長，因公不克蒞臨訓導，由本人代表。上海市舉行運動大會自事變後，成績都慢慢一步步的進展，上海可說全國運動最進步的「個地方，所以今天舉行這運動會，相信成績一定很好，因場地關係故延至今日舉行。今日舉行這運動會的意義，爲全國民衆要達到民族國家的發達，要創造我們國民的健全體格。各位都知道，國民精神薄弱這國家也要薄弱，反之則强。我國在運動方面一向比別國落後，所以極應提倡運動，尤應注重平時的訓練，今天只不過合起來總訓練而已。今年這會較之去年更爲偉大，自從租界收回後，全市中小學八十餘校均參加，更帶有統一的意義。現承各位長官　臨，及各界援助捐贈獎品及獎金，特表謝意」云，旋由敎部代表趙次長訓話：</p>
<h3>南市區舞校　限六月底禁絕</h3>
<p>南市全區，爲大賭場一致奉令停業外，市第二警察局遵奉市府指令，分飭所管轄境內，所有舞校一律限於六月底悉數停閉，不得遠延，致</p>
<p>敎次訓詞</p>
<p>略謂：「教育部長派本人代表參加，覺得非常愉快，本部爲提倡敎育，陳市長及林局長領導下，成續非常明顯，提倡體育不是只開幾次運動會便算了事，要積極提倡，第一要普遍化，第二要永久化，不但靑年男女要注重體格健康，就是每一個國民也應鍛煉體格，開運動會僅是提倡之道。其重要性在於參加的人互相比賽，互相觀摩，如此運動會才能促進體育。在上海這地方提倡體育有種種困難，第一點人烟稠密，學校林立，每校是否能獲得一廣大運動場，這是很大缺點。第二點上海市引人到不大高尚娛樂的地方較多，所以上海市一切的人都要振作去克服這種困難，要每個人都有銅筋鐵骨的體魄，才能擔負起興複中華，保衛東亞的責任。」</p>
<p>團體操演</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on the Grain Problem</h3>
<p>We feel that the recent soaring black market rice prices indicate the severity of the food crisis is just beginning. If we do not earnestly examine the causes of past failures, and address the current environment with measures that tackle both the symptoms and the root causes, the people's suffering will be even worse than it is today, and this cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p>In our editorial on the 2nd of this month, titled "Requesting the Government to Encourage Agricultural Production," we pointed out that farmers have a hesitant attitude towards planting food crops, interwoven with indecisive choices, which may lead to two possible outcomes. First, a reduction in rice planting area to avoid losses from low-price purchases. Second, even if they plant, they may be passive and unwilling to work diligently. Both of these outcomes result in reduced food production. Therefore, we advocate: 1. Prohibiting the military from directly purchasing rice from farmers. Military rice needs should be collected and distributed by a unified agency at reasonable prices, to reduce farmers' psychological panic. 2. Rice purchase prices must take into account farmers' costs, plus a reasonable profit, to reduce the psychological impact of low prices on farmers. 3. With regard to civilian rice consumption outside of military rice needs, given the painful past experiences, it is worth re-examining and considering.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in our editorial on the 9th of this month, titled "The Timing for Considering the Grain Problem," we reviewed the past failures of grain policy and considered the direction to take in the future. The reason why we repeatedly raise the issue of grain is that, seriously speaking, food is the top priority among people's livelihood issues. Without solving the grain problem, there is no basis for social stability. When people's livelihood cannot be stabilized to a certain extent, not only will the rural areas be chaotic, but the cities will also be increasingly vulnerable, which will inevitably form a large-scale refugee situation caused by artificial famine. Try to imagine this with your eyes closed, how terrifying it is!</p>
<p>We have no new or different insights, only a reiteration of what we have advocated in the past:</p>
<p>The most urgent matter at present is to hope that the authorities will promptly issue measures to encourage farmers to plant rice. The goal is to make rice planting profitable for farmers, so they will automatically increase the planting area and output. Passively, we should no longer forcibly purchase rice at a fixed price. At the same time, we should utilize wasteland and relocate displaced people to engage in cultivation.</p>
<p>During this wartime, military rice is undoubtedly the top priority, but the central government should be fully responsible for its supply. Local (county) governments should cooperate with local rice merchants to undertake the purchasing work, taking into account the farmers' costs and reasonable profits, and adjusting the purchase price according to the price situation. On the other hand, for farmers paying taxes, we can try to collect taxes in kind. Local governments should be rewarded for handling the work well, and severely punished for poor management or fraud.</p>
<p>Regarding the rice supply issue in Shanghai, according to news from the Municipal Advisory Committee a few days ago, a solution has been drafted and is awaiting approval from the Mayor. We hope that the municipal authorities and the committee will quickly implement practical and easy-to-implement measures. At the same time, the cooperation of the Allied authorities is particularly necessary. We believe that the Allied authorities have long deeply understood the importance of the food issue and will not underestimate it. In addition, it is also extremely important for rice merchants to abandon their self-interest and cooperate from the sidelines. It is time for everyone to work together to save the situation.</p>
<p>Translated Commentary</p>
<h3>The Grain Contribution Reward System</h3>
<p>Currently, the average yield per "duan" (300 square steps, each step 6 square feet) of rice paddy nationwide is two "shi," valued at 125 yuan. Meanwhile, the income from planting fruit trees and vegetables on a "duan" of land often reaches hundreds of yuan. Therefore, the income from rice crops is relatively low. Although the government has been encouraging changes in crops for the past two or three years, travelers can see everywhere that the central parts of the plains are still planted with endless rows of fruit trees. The reason why farmers are unwilling to change crops, and why local authorities cannot make farmers change crops, is due to the economic factor of low profits from rice cultivation. Planting non-essential crops not only occupies land, but also absorbs valuable fertilizer and labor. How much can the grain contribution increase due to the implementation of this contribution reward and incentive system? It is not yet known whether farmers will be willing to reduce planting fruit trees and switch to rice cultivation, but it is fortunate that we can see some progress in implementation.</p>
<p>Moreover, rural areas throughout the country have a habit of using substitute food. Due to the implementation of this system, since it is necessary to contribute as much rice as possible, the gradual recovery of this old habit is also a welcome trend. Therefore, it is not excessive for the bonus reward to be set at 75 to 100 yuan per "shi."</p>
<p>However, many worries have been raised, believing that rural inflation may occur. But this is not a cause for concern. Although there is more money in the countryside, there are fewer materials to buy. Therefore, the remaining funds are almost entirely saved. In fact, there is nothing better than the countryside when it comes to saving to serve the country. If cooperation is required to prevent wartime inflation, attention should be paid to the financial aspects with the largest expenditures and the prosperous industrial relations. Efforts should be made to save money in this regard, so as not to despise money and waste expenses. However, it would be difficult to pre-determine the quota for this contribution affair, based on past performance and statistics, ignoring recent trends, and setting figures that are not in line with actual harvests.</p>
<p>Secondly, how to plan in advance when stipulating the quota for the decisive materials that govern food production, such as the increase in cultivated land and the reduction of fertilizer and labor, is also a question, and the most important thing is the climate and disasters. Regarding these points, when adopting practical quota methods, eliminating malicious sabotage movements by powerful people in the locality, and eliminating unequal factors in rural areas, are also points that the authorities must pay the most attention to. It is of course very appropriate for the Ministry of Agriculture to consider the current situation based on past performance and set quotas for various prefectures and counties. But those who are in charge of the actual work are the prefectural and county authorities. Therefore, the effectiveness of this system depends entirely on the efforts of the prefectural and county authorities, and the task of local officials can be said to be becoming increasingly important. We cannot help but hope for the self-respect and efforts of the local authorities. (Xiang: Translated from the May 1st issue of Japan's "Hochi Shimbun")</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Expresses Determination to Complete the Greater East Asia War; Unprecedented Grand Gathering of National Total Uprising</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Central General Assembly of the National Total Uprising Movement, jointly organized by the Japan Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association, was held this morning from 8:00 AM at the Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo. Present were advisors to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, general affairs councilors, executive members and staff of organizations affiliated with councilors from the Tokyo Cooperation Conference, executive members and chiefs of the Asia Development Headquarters, the Japan Women's Association, the Greater Japan Youth Corps, the Commercial Patriotic Association, the Imperial Rule Assistance Senior Corps, all members in Tokyo from the Political Support Association, and from the government side, Prime Minister Tojo and other cabinet ministers, vice-ministers of various ministries, Governor of Tokyo Prefecture Tatsuta, and Director-General of Medical Affairs Usuta, totaling approximately 3,500 people. The assembly began with the reading of the Imperial Rescript, followed by the Vice-President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association reading an oath, then a speech by Abe, President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association, and a speech by Kobayashi, Chairman of the Central Cooperation Conference. Afterwards, Prime Minister Tojo gave a speech, earnestly expressing his determination to complete the Greater East Asia War, moving the entire audience. Later, the assembly elected representatives to visit the Ise Grand Shrine, the Meiji Shrine, and the Yasukuni Shrine for prayers of victory. At the same time, to express gratitude to the frontline soldiers, the assembly drafted a telegram to the frontline soldiers, which was handed over to the Army and Navy authorities for transmission. Finally, the assembly closed in a solemn atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Main Points of Prime Minister Tojo's Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The main points of Prime Minister Tojo's speech are as follows: Overview of the Current War Situation - On the Pacific, Burmese, and Chinese fronts, due to the bravery and skill of the Japanese army, the East Asian war situation is truly entering a decisive phase. In dealing with this severe war situation, Japan has been able to utilize resources from China, Manchuria, and various parts of the South over the two and a half years since the start of the war, achieving complete self-sufficiency in military supplies and producing aircraft at quantities never imagined before the war. In addition, self-sufficiency in food, mobilization of manpower, and unity of spirit from top to bottom, along with superior strength, are all sufficient to take on the great task of defeating Britain and the United States. On this day of national emergency, we deeply feel the necessity of the uprising and unity of 100 million citizens in order to focus all our strength on the path to victory. The key to the national movement is to awaken the loyalty of the people and promote and develop it. Based on this, all those in authority must be loyal to their duties. At the same time, those in a position to guide the people must instill this great cause into people's hearts so that the true voices of the people are reflected in policy. We must deeply understand the nation's integrity, endure all hardships, and fight for the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia. To build this great cause, we, the 100 million citizens, must thoroughly unite in order to unleash the full power of Greater East Asia. The so-called final victory depends on the fighting will of our people. If we can overcome all hardships, we will surely be able to seize the key to victory or defeat. Today, it is definitely not about material resources, but only by relying on the most resolute spiritual strength can we decide the outcome.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Henan Adopts Encirclement Tactics Against Luoyang; Completion of the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>Zurich, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch, Reuters from Chongqing) - The Japanese army in the Henan war zone is advancing fiercely towards Luoyang from all directions. The fall of the city is only a matter of time. An advance unit of the Japanese army has already approached Luoyang to within eight kilometers.</p>
<p>Shanghai, Central News Agency News - A spokesman for the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission told reporters on the 12th: "The Japanese army has successfully opened up the Pinghan Railway in this operation in Henan. Therefore, the Japanese army has achieved its goal of driving the Chongqing army along the railway line far into the western mountainous areas." Regarding the war situation after the opening of the Pinghan Railway, foreign journalists stationed in Chongqing observed that the Japanese army is currently shifting the center of the battle line to the Luoyang area, which is now completely surrounded by the Japanese army, and its fall is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Near Luoyang Thwarted</p>
<p>Xinzheng, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Following the progress of the war in southern Henan, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing Air Force are also gradually becoming active. Especially after the Japanese army captured Xuchang, the frequency of their attacks has increased. However, these enemy aircraft have been repeatedly intercepted by Japanese aircraft and have suffered heavy damage. For example, on the morning of the 12th, a Japanese army unit shot down three P49-type aircraft near Luoyang with machine guns. At 10:45 AM on the 12th, they also intercepted five enemy P49-type aircraft attacking near Luoyang, immediately shooting down one of them. In the afternoon of the same day, more than ten enemy P40-type aircraft attacked near Luoyang, but after being intercepted by the Japanese army, two of them were shot down. The remaining enemy aircraft, seeing the situation was not good, immediately fled.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Shaozhou</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese aircraft bombed Shaozhou, a key point in northern Guangdong Province, at 10:50 AM on the 12th. They dropped heavy bombs near the East Station of Shaozhou, causing a fire in the city's military facilities and two military supply warehouses. Subsequently, all Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.</p>
<p>US Aircraft Attack Hankou</p>
<p>Yingkou, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - To cover up their defeat, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing used medium-sized aircraft to attack Hankou at 3:15 PM on the 13th, blindly dropping several bombs and then fleeing. The incendiary bombs dropped were immediately extinguished, and there was no damage to the land.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Returns Private Silkworm Seed Farms in Zhenjiang and Jurong</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - In order to return the private silkworm seed manufacturing farms in Sibaidu, Gaozi Town, Dantu County, Jiangsu Province, and Qiaotou Town, Jurong County, which were handed over by the former China Central Silk Company, the Ministry of Industry has specially formulated provisional measures, which have been promulgated and implemented by ministerial order. It is reported that when the original owners or entrusted agents apply for the return, they should submit a recovery plan and documentary evidence such as ownership deeds, silkworm seed manufacturing farm permits, and shareholder rosters for verification. If they are lost, they should obtain a certificate from the local competent authority or the trade association and submit it to the Ministry of Industry for verification. After the Ministry's review deems it qualified, the original owners or agents must publish a statement of property rights in the Nanjing, Shanghai, and Suzhou newspapers for three consecutive days. If no objection is raised, it can be returned. After the return, the owners should report to the county government where the farm is located and forward it to the Executive Yuan for filing. All expenses incurred during the period when the Ministry acted as custodian will be reimbursed by the original owners or entrusted agents in accordance with the amount approved by the Executive Yuan. The deadline for applying for the return is three months from the date of the newspaper announcement. It is deeply believed that after all the aforementioned private silkworm seed manufacturing farms are returned, there will be further development in the future of China's silk industry.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry's Department of Agriculture and Forestry Promotes Hemp Planting</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since its establishment, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Ministry of Industry has been actively promoting various increase production projects, sparing no effort.

Furthermore, it will propagate superior hemp seeds. The existing effective yellow hemp and foreign hemp in the trials will be actively propagated. It will designate the Yaohuamen, Moluguan, and Jiangpu demonstration farms and the seventh and twelfth afforestation demonstration farms of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, with each site demarcated from 30 to 50 mu, specifically for trial use. As for the promotion of hemp cultivation, it will be carried out separately in the two provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang Sends Representatives to Pay Tribute to Advisor Kabashima; Simple and Solemn Memorial Ceremony</h3>

<h3>Japanese Envoy to Asia Visits Manchurian Dignitaries</h3>

<h3>Fierce Battles Unfolding South of Bishenpur; Enemy Aircraft Attacking Burma Shot Down Six</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Calcutta dispatch: Japanese and British-Indian forces have engaged in 12 fierce battles in the small village of Kabosangam, south of Bishenpur.</p>
<p>Yangon, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - On the morning of the 11th, Japanese aircraft engaged in fierce aerial combat with a total of 12 US rocket-powered P38 fighter planes, North American P51 fighter planes, and ultra-high-speed fighter planes that invaded a certain area. As a result, six of them were shot down.</p>
<h3>Northern Kuril Islands Defenses Impregnable; Enemy Attempts to Invade Will Inevitably Meet with Misfortune</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The United States is counterattacking like mad in the southwestern Pacific and central Pacific, but so far has only occupied a few small islands on one end of Japan's outer defense perimeter. The purpose of their counteroffensive operations is, of course, to attack Japan's inner defense line and even the Japanese mainland. In this sense, the current US invasion operations against Japan's northern Kuril Islands should be paid attention to. Since the Japanese army withdrew from Kiska Island, it has been a month, and both sides are facing off, with little progress. Why is the United States so silent? This must be said to be the credit of the solid defense of the northern Kuril Islands. The northern Kuril Islands' defenses have four great fortresses: First, the icy and snowy fortress that benefits from the windy and snowy weather; second, the water's edge fortress that benefits from the treacherous reefs and currents; third, the mechanized fortress formed by mechanized land mobile units; and fourth, the air force fortress with complete equipment and powerful strength. With these four fortresses, it is only natural that the enemy army has only been able to engage in reconnaissance work for almost a year. In terms of defense in that area, the US military should dispel its delusions as soon as possible. If they continue to indulge their emotions and attempt an invasion, they will suffer a major blow that will affect their overall counteroffensive and leave them unable to recover.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Gandhi Memorial Service</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Treats Foreign Guests to a Tour of Xuanwu Lake</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The weather has been clear and the breeze gentle in recent days, perfect for outings. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially hosted foreign guests in Nanjing for a spring outing at Xuanwu Lake at 3:00 PM this afternoon, enjoying the beautiful scenery of mountains and water. Those who attended included Japanese Ambassador Tani, Secretary Shimizu, Councilor Matsumura, Councilor Ota and his wife, and Secretary Ishikawa's wife; German Ambassador Wellmann, Secretary Boling, Secretary Erlewin, and Dr. Huo Fumin of the Sino-German Society of Beijing; Manchurian Embassy Councilor Zhang, Secretary Ding, Secretary Liu, and Assistant Officer Nishimura; and French Consulate General Satchard and his wife. The guests were warmly received by Minister Chu and his wife of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Chen stationed in Manchuria, Minister Zhang, Councilor Zhang, Director Fan, and Director Xu. Many ministers and officials also attended to accompany them. At 3:00 PM, the foreign guests arrived at the lake one after another, enjoying the lake view. They then went to Yingzi Hall to rest and watch a performance of Chinese arts. For a time, distinguished guests gathered and the atmosphere was unusually enthusiastic. It was truly a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Southern Italy Adopts Offensive Stance; Prelude to the European Land War; Both Sides Reinforce, Intensifying the War</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News Agency reports: The British and American forces on the Italian front have launched a large-scale offensive, which seems to be the prelude to the European land war. The German High Command announced yesterday that "this offensive is intended to contain and distract the enemy forces," and should not be seen as a single military operation. The Italian war should be seen in connection with the anti-Axis forces' plan to invade Europe. The German High Command believes that the intensified air raids by the British and American air forces on German-occupied areas in Western Europe are "preparations for the invasion of Europe." The anti-Axis forces' offensive in southern Italy is clearly intended to divert the German High Command's attention from the English Channel and the Atlantic coast, drawing German troops from that area to southern Italy. The intensified air raids by anti-Axis aircraft on the southern coast of France are also noteworthy. There is no clear center of operations in the Italian war. It is also possible that the anti-Axis forces intend to adopt a pincer strategy on both the north and south sides of Pescara. The enemy has dispatched reinforcements, and the German army has also increased its reserves, making the war increasingly fierce.</p>
<p>Heavy Atmosphere of Murder on the Rapido River</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to German estimates, the anti-Axis forces are using approximately four to five divisions in this offensive, totaling approximately 60,000 to 75,000 men. Combining previous reports, the battle is unfolding in a zone of approximately 30 miles from Cassino to the Tyrrhenian Sea. The anti-Axis forces used boats and pontoon bridges to cross the Rapido River, and then pursued the German army from the outer perimeter of the Gustav Line.</p>
<h3>Western Europe Suffers Continuous Air Raids</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - A communique from the German Fuehrer's Headquarters stated that a large formation of US bombers bombed eastern Germany on the 12th during the day. Although some damage was sustained, 91 of the attacking enemy aircraft were shot down. Among them, 50 were four-engine bombers. On the night of the 12th, the British Air Force attacked the northern coast of Germany and several areas of Belgium in small formations. The German night fighter squadron shot down 13 four-engine bombers. The recent continuous air raids by the anti-Axis forces on occupied areas in Western Europe are clearly a prelude to landing operations.</p>
<h3>Wallace to Depart for Chongqing</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a report from Washington, US Vice President Wallace will depart for Chongqing soon. It is rumored that after visiting Chongqing, he also intends to visit India and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Amended Regulations for Ship Navigation in the Central China Area: Statements from Both Authorities</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency): To ensure the unimpeded flow of materials, a rational solution to the transportation problem is a prerequisite. Water transport in the Central China area has always been convenient, so the transportation of general materials relies heavily on ships. After the Incident, the Allied land and naval authorities formulated management regulations for ship navigation in our Central China area, which were implemented. Since implementation, they have had a significant impact on the overall shipping operations. Now, our national government authorities, in order to further establish a wartime transportation system, have repeatedly consulted with the Allied land and naval authorities to propose amending the above-mentioned ship navigation regulations to adapt to the actual situation. We are grateful for the sincere assistance of the Allied authorities. As a result of consultations, it was decided to formally amend and implement the regulations from the 15th of this month. The previous regulations restricting the transportation of materials and personnel will be completely abolished. Civilian ships under 30 tons are allowed to freely navigate the Yangtze River and inland waterways without applying for navigation permits. Ships over 30 tons that have joined the Central China Ships (Junk) Association or the Central China Inland River Civilian Ship Association as members generally do not need to obtain permits when navigating the Yangtze River and inland waterways. However, if navigating along the coast, a permit must be obtained from the naval authorities. Furthermore, the procedures for other ships to apply for permits will be simplified. We will continue to make every effort to prevent all kinds of illegal private transportation and navigation that obstructs public order. It is firmly believed that after this amendment, the number of ships navigating will certainly increase due to the relaxation of restrictions. Therefore, the shipping problem will naturally become more rational and smooth, which will greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. Furthermore, the smooth flow of shipping will further promote the smooth exchange of materials. Therefore, the amendment of these navigation regulations can directly improve shipping and indirectly contribute to the great cause of material exchange and stabilizing people's livelihoods. While we eagerly anticipate this, we deeply appreciate the sincere assistance of the Allied land and naval authorities. Vice Premier Zhou of the Executive Yuan and the authorities of the Japanese Embassy yesterday issued important statements respectively, concerning the significance of this move. They also deeply hope that all ship owners and sailors will understand the purpose and cooperate to accomplish the authorities' intention to improve shipping.</p>
<p>Statement by Vice Premier Zhou</p>
<p>Water transport in the Central China area has always been convenient, so material transportation relies heavily on ships. This time, after consultations with the Allied land and naval authorities, and thanks to their utmost sincere assistance, it was decided to amend the regulations governing the general ship navigation control in the Central China area. It will be implemented from May 15th. In the future, the number of ships can be increased, and transportation will be smoother, which will greatly benefit people's livelihoods. The main points of the amendment are as follows: All previously established regulations restricting the transportation of materials and personnel will be abolished and handled in accordance with general rules. Provisionally, civilian ships under 30 tons are not required to apply for permits and can freely navigate the Yangtze River and inland waterways. For ships over 30 tons that have joined the Central China Junk (Ship) Association or the Central China Inland River Civilian Ship General Association, they may be exempted from obtaining navigation permits when navigating the Yangtze River and inland waterways in principle. If member ships navigate along the coast, they should apply for permits from the naval authorities. The issuance of navigation permits for other ships will be further simplified to improve shipping efficiency.</p>
<p>The National Government expresses its utmost admiration for this wise measure of assistance from the Allied land and naval authorities. In the future, with the smooth flow of shipping, we will work harder to promote the circulation of materials and stabilize people's livelihoods. All measures that hinder shipping, various donations and taxes that have not been approved will be abolished and strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>At the same time, we will continue to make every effort to prevent all kinds of illegal private transportation and navigation that obstructs public order. Once discovered, they will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Statement by the Japanese Embassy</p>
<p>The Japanese land and naval authorities stationed in China yesterday announced the revision of the "Regulations for Controlling General Ship Navigation in the Central China Area," easing control over general ship navigation. There are four main points of the revision: (Already seen in Vice Premier Zhou's statement on the regulations.) This is because the Japanese military authorities are considerate of the people's feelings, and on the other hand, it is due to the general public's efforts to maintain security. It is sincerely hoped that ship owners will, in the future, thank the Japanese military authorities for their kindness, deeply understand the purpose of this revision of the regulations, truly dedicate themselves to increasing transportation and cooperating to ensure security, and not transport materials beneficial to the enemy or engage in smuggling, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Statement by the Person in Charge of the Civilian Ship General Association</p>
<p>After our country's authorities agreed with the Allied authorities to revise the "Regulations for Controlling General Ship Navigation in the Central China Area," it will greatly benefit the transportation of materials and the stabilization of people's livelihoods. The reporter recently interviewed the person in charge of the Central China Inland River Civilian Ship General Association, who said on this matter: "Our country and the Allied authorities' decision to revise the general ship control regulations is a very wise measure. According to recent surveys, there are a total of 18,895 civilian ships in the Central China area, totaling 542,360 tons, with 326,000 men and women making a living by operating these ships. In the past, due to strict controls, the shipping industry could not fully develop. In the future, with freedom of navigation, the lives of these hundreds of thousands of people can be stabilized, and they can contribute to the circulation of materials and the construction of the national economy, especially to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. We are sincerely pleased and look forward to it."</p>

<h3>Authorities Actively Strengthen Material Control: Price Management Countermeasures Committee to be Established</h3>
<p>Since the National Government implemented wartime economic policies, established the Materials Control Deliberation Committee, and charged the National Commercial Control General Association with implementing the national materials control task, it has been a week, and the results have not yet reached the ideal goal. Therefore, in order to complete the control task and balance the supply and demand of materials, the control mechanism is being actively strengthened. Various major materials related to people's livelihoods are being thoroughly adjusted. The authorities are currently studying a thorough adjustment of the overall policy of material control and distribution. At the same time, preparations are being made to establish a price management countermeasures committee to fairly coordinate prices and unify operations, while focusing on urgently increasing production.</p>
<h3>4th Middle and Elementary School Games: Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday, Over 80 Participating Schools, Extremely Grand</h3>
<p>The 4th Shanghai Municipal Joint Middle and Elementary School Sports Meeting was held yesterday (14th) morning at 10:00 AM in Hongkou Park at the end of North Sichuan Road in Hongkou. Deputy Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Education, Vice President of the Conference and Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Lin Jiong'an, Municipal Government Advisor Pan Da, National Sports Association Shen Siliang, and Xi Peiwen, among others, attended to provide guidance. Eight thousand people, including all staff members of the conference and athletes from various schools, were present. At 10:00 AM sharp, the opening ceremony began. The venue was arranged in an orderly manner. After the opening music was played, the flag was raised. All the athletes circled the field in the midst of military music. Each school was led by its flag, fluttering in the wind, brilliant and dazzling. At the front of the platform, everyone stood at attention and saluted. The entire assembly faced east and paid their respects to Chairman Wang. Vice President of the Conference, Chairman Lin, reported on the significance of the opening. Deputy Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Education, Pan Da, Shen Siliang, and others successively gave speeches. The entire assembly sang the Sports Meeting Song. The schools jointly performed a grand exercise, and Shunhua, Director of the Second Department of the Population Department of the Ministry of Social Welfare, led a demonstration of simple exercises. The sports activities then began.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>He briefly stated: "Mayor Chen, the president of the Municipal Sports Meeting, is unable to attend and give instructions today due to official business, so I will represent him. Since the Incident, the Shanghai Municipal Sports Meeting has been progressing slowly but steadily. Shanghai can be said to be the most progressive place for sports in the country. Therefore, I believe that the results of today's sports meeting will be very good. Due to venue issues, it has been postponed until today. The significance of today's sports meeting is that the people of the whole country must achieve the development of the nation and the state, and create a sound physique for our people. As you all know, if the national spirit is weak, the country will also be weak, and vice versa. Our country has always lagged behind other countries in sports, so we should vigorously promote sports, and especially pay attention to regular training. Today is just a joint training. This year's conference is even more grand than last year's. Since the recovery of the concessions, more than 80 middle and elementary schools in the city have participated, which has a more unified meaning. We are grateful to the officials present and the assistance of all sectors of society in donating prizes and bonuses." Then, Deputy Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Education gave a speech.</p>
<h3>Dance Schools in the Nanshi District to be Banned by the End of June</h3>
<p>In addition to all large casinos being ordered to close in the Nanshi District, the Second Police Bureau of the city, following the instructions of the municipal government, ordered all dance schools within its jurisdiction to be closed by the end of June without delay.</p>
<p>Speech by Deputy Minister Zhao</p>
<p>He briefly stated: "The Minister of Education sent me as a representative to participate, and I feel very happy. Under the leadership of Mayor Chen and Director Lin, the Ministry has made very obvious progress in promoting education. Promoting sports is not just a matter of holding a few sports meetings and then letting it go. We must actively promote it. First, it must be universalized. Second, it must be permanent. Not only young men and women should pay attention to their physical health, but every citizen should also exercise their bodies. Holding sports meetings is just a way to promote it. Its importance lies in the participants competing with each other and learning from each other. In this way, the sports meeting can promote sports. There are various difficulties in promoting sports in Shanghai. The first point is that the population is dense and there are many schools. Whether each school can obtain a large sports field is a major shortcoming. The second point is that Shanghai attracts people to places of less noble entertainment. Therefore, everyone in Shanghai must work hard to overcome these difficulties. Everyone must have a physique of copper tendons and iron bones in order to shoulder the responsibility of revitalizing China and defending East Asia."</p>
<p>Group Exercises</p>
<p>More than ten middle and elementary schools participated in the group exercise performance. Those who performed in the morning included Gezhi Middle School's Human Pyramid, the Second Normal School's Fitness Exercise, Hanbi Li Western Children's Middle School's "Human Pyramid" and "Human Horse," and group exercises from Yinghua Elementary School, He'an Elementary School, Tongcheng Elementary School, Feihong Elementary School, Tianzhu Elementary School, Nancang Elementary School, Hanbi Li Elementary School, and Huxi Elementary School. In the afternoon, there were the Second Middle School's "First Aid," Peixing Middle School's "Arhat Boxing," and Zhongshi Elementary School's group exercises.</p>
<p>Today's Schedule</p>
<p>The semi-finals and finals of the 50-meter race for middle school girls' groups A and B and elementary school boys' groups A and B, which were held yesterday (14th), were not awakened. They will be held this morning (15th). Athletes participating in the competition should pay attention. Other programs will still follow the order of the items.</p>
<h3>Civil Defense Headquarters Organizes an Inspection Team</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters recently selected four people from each of the Police, Fire, Rescue, and General Affairs departments to form an inspection team in order to strengthen the local civil defense mechanism. They are scheduled to visit Tokyo, Hankou, and Guangzhou on the 20th of this month to inspect the civil defense situation and learn from their experiences.</p>
<h3>Guo Xiufeng Returns to Shanghai After Completing Visit to Japan</h3>
<p>Guo Xiufeng, Vice Minister of the Propaganda Department of the National Government and President of the Central News Agency, and Hu Yingzhou, Vice President of the agency, were invited by President Kuno of the Allied Domei News Agency to visit Japan on the 4th of this month.

<h3>Saving 20% of Electricity: Saving 2,000 Tons of Coal per Month: Water and Electricity Company Encourages People to Cooperate</h3>
<p>According to a new report from the mainland, in order to solve the coal shortage, the China Water and Electricity Shanghai Electric Power Company has decided to implement an intensified electricity saving period for three months starting from May 21. The amount of electricity saved will be reduced by 20% from the original limit. If the results are satisfactory, the entire Central China area can save 1.3 million kilowatts of electricity per month, which translates to at least 2,000 tons of coal, which can be avoided. It is reported that the Central China Water and Electricity Authority hopes that residents will reduce the use of non-essential items such as electric fans this summer and practice a "one-light" movement. (Another news) The China Water and Electricity Company, together with the authorities, will organize a savings award committee to encourage residents to cooperate in saving electricity consumption.</p>
<h3>Cotton Production General Association Promotes Association Affairs</h3>
<p>Since the Cotton Production Agreement General Association was established in Shanghai last month, the association has conducted detailed discussions on this year's cotton production and procurement plans and determined the plan. It is learned that the association believes that the construction of cotton producing areas and the repair of river embankments, as well as the improvement of cotton fields, urgently need to be carried out actively. The association plans to allocate 60 million yuan from the remaining funds for cotton production as special funds for the above needs.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Market Conditions for Finance, Industry, and Commerce Last Week</h3>
<p>The market conditions for finance and various industries in Shanghai last week were stable as usual. Because the authorities are strictly cracking down on speculation, investors in general are unable to act, so there are very few changes in financial dynamics. However, due to strong selling pressure and an abundance of chips on the market, Huagu stocks were unable to absorb market transactions and were swayed by rumors, causing the market to fall. The silver market became tighter again last week, but fortunately, the silver and money industries raised funds to adjust, so legitimate industries and businesses were not affected in any way. The market prices of major goods remained stable, but rice prices soared in the black market due to the delay in household rice distribution and the private increases by rice merchants, and the panic over food for the people is becoming increasingly serious. It is reported that the authorities are actively adjusting the rice distribution, and it is expected that the food problem will be solved soon, and rice prices may fall back. The authorities will severely punish those who hoard rice privately if they are found out.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Local Court Adjusts Fees for Official Documents and Transportation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Court has adjusted the standards for vehicle expenses for delivering official documents due to rising prices since the relocation, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval and implementation. The regulations stipulate that 4 yuan will be charged for within 10 li, 6 yuan for outside, 8 yuan for outside 15 li, 10 yuan for 30 li, 15 yuan for 40 li, 20 yuan for 50 li, plus 10 yuan for food expenses, 25 yuan for 60 li, 10 yuan for food expenses, and 30 yuan for 70 li, 20 yuan for food expenses, and 10 yuan for lodging expenses. If the same case occurs within the same address, it will be shared proportionally.</p>
<h3>Black Market Coal Briquettes: Quality Needs to be Corrected</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of coal briquette distribution by household, it has been three months, but because the quantity distributed each period is insufficient for residents' use, they have been adding other fuels to replace it. General speculative coal merchants are using mixed coal layers and a large amount of yellow mud to make coal briquettes and sell them to users at high black market prices, with prices starting at 500 yuan per load. However, the manufacturing quality and selling price of these coal briquettes need to be effectively corrected, otherwise, it will cause considerable harm to people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Fisheries Administration Bureau Plans to Organize Fishery Protection Police</h3>
<p>In order to effectively revitalize our country's fishing industry and enrich wartime materials, the protection of fishermen and the police urgently need to be organized and trained. It is learned that the bureau is currently looking for suitable housing in the Nanshi area to start training.</p>

At the beginning of the match, Donghua took advantage of the wind, and the whole team advanced. Fu Kezhen passed the ball to Dai Linjing, who made an overhead bicycle kick. Li Yao passed in from the sideline, and the angle was accurate, with a good wind blowing into the bottom of the net. Donghua's center forward received the ball again and again, cleverly positioning himself. Unbeknownst to Qiaolian's forward, he lost his movement under Donghua's heavy encirclement. Qiaolian's McNitty was injured and left the field, replaced by Roddy. Sixteen minutes later, General Han descended from the sky and scored again, making it three to zero. Qiaolian worked hard, and Siratti passed to Kapaivei. Zhang Banglun pounced and ran far away, and Kapaivei shot into the empty net, pulling back a goal. Donghua was unwilling to be outdone. Han Longhai rode deeply into the enemy camp, calmly completing a goal. At the end of the first half, Donghua had an absolute advantage with a score of four to one. In the second half, Di Panna rested and Teknik replaced him. Donghua's original army remained unchanged. Qiaolian took the offensive first.
