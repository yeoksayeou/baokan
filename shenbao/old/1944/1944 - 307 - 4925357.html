<h3>日小首相　電各國致賀</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　今（六日）爲大東亞共同宣言屬年紀念日，日小　首相特電吾國周代行政院長表示互相祝賀，同時分電滿·泰·緬·菲各國當局表示賀意。</p>
<h3>爲整個大東亞　爭取自由與獨立　—陳代主席廣播演說詞</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　陳代主席以月之六日，爲大東亞共同宣言一週紀念日，特於是日晚廣播，茲錄原詞於后：</p>
<p>去年十一月六日，跟着在中日同盟條約簽訂之後，大東亞各國爲協議完遂大東亞戰爭，建設東亞新秩序，以共同奮鬥，完成共同目的，在東京舉行大東亞會議，與會者有中·日·滿·泰·菲·緬六國代表，印度臨時政府主席亦列席參加，代表大東亞十萬萬民眾，展開東亞自有歷史以來的空前監會。第一日，各國代表分別表明各國對於完遂大東亞戰爭建設大東亞的決意，第二日，以一致之決議，發表會議精華的大東亞共同宣言。道篇宣言，是大東亞各民族對世界和平，所寄予最高信念的大典章，也是大東亞各民族信守不渝的誓約。</p>
<p>自從大東亞戰爭爆發以後，積年以來根深蒂固的英美侵略主義惡勢力，漸次被驅逐於東亞領域以外，大東亞之本來面目得以恢復，而東亞各國已往相互間的一切誤解與隔閡，亦以對外的利害一致而排除無餘，英美侵略主義的挑撥離間，原爲東亞各民族間種種芥蒂的主要因素，一旦排除淨盡，東亞各民族間，由於歷史地理種種關係，而天然潛在的友好精誠，立即復現，大東亞共同宣言，即爲此友好精誠的總結晶。</p>
<p>宣言內容一斑</p>
<p>大東亞宣言的內容，第一段指出確立世界和平之根本要義，第二段指出大東亞戰爭之原因，第三段指出完遂戰爭與完成建設之決意，第四段指出大東亞建設之綱領。綱領第一條，確立共存共榮之共同目的。第二條，確立自主獨立，互助敦睦之政治原則。第三條，確立互尊傳統發展民族創造性之交化原則。第四條，確立互惠提攜，共圖樂榮之經濟原則。第五條，確立萬邦協和，撤廢人種差別，普行溝通文化，開放資源之世界理念。歷年以來，吾人所揭築政治獨立，軍事同盟，經濟合作，文化溝通之四大綱領，至此遂以盟邦日本之引導與大東亞各國之全體支持而更具體的確立。而國父所倡導之大亞洲主義，亦由此得到了實現的機運。由於宣言的內容，我們可以瞭然於盟邦日本之目的，其所以全力擔任大東亞戰爭的前鋒，驅逐英美侵略的勢力，乃在求得東亞的整個解放，使一向被英美侵略的各國，皆能獨立自主，並且相互協力，相互提携，這種偉大的道義精神，本屬東方所固有，往日因英美侵略主義的作崇，而不克表現者，至此乃得伸其本然的自由意志，充分表現。</p>
<p>在大東亞戰爭爆發之後，大東亞共同宣言發表以前，其間盟邦日本，對於致力協助東亞各民族的獨立與自主，曾先後以事實證明，例如中國的收回租界與撤廢治外法權，緬甸的獨立，菲律賓的獨立，此皆舉世人士之所共見，大東亞共同宣言發表以後，盟邦日本對於此種努力，更見積極，例如援助印度國民軍，以實行共復國的鬥爭，援助菲律賓，緬甸以抵禦侵略者之進迫，就是最顯著的明證。</p>
<p>由於宣言之內容，我們更要瞭然於東亞各國對世界和平之正義的要求與期待，我們之所以從事戰爭，乃爲生存而戰，爲自衛而戰，我們的終極目的在和平，戰爭之主要任務，亦在和平，爲保障和平，乃不得不掃除和平之障碍。我們所要求的和平，有僅是爲東亞的，並且是爲世界的，人種差別是民族仇怨的原因，必須加以撤廢，資源獨佔，爲生存競爭的引綫，亦爲我們所不取。大東亞共同宣言議決發表的當時，汪主席曾經說過：「此宣言之特色，在昭示東方之道義精神，一掃西方功利主義之見解。詳細些說，即是將英美刦略榨取之，傳統政策，根本的予以肅清，而重新聞　　共存共榮之東亞新天地…這樣東亞各國必然日趨於精誠團結，使國利民福日益增進，同時世界和平，亦必然於此發端」。又說：「大東亞戰爭，乃共榮主義對殖民主義之戰爭…消極方面之掃蕩英美之侵略勢力，積極方面，在確立大東亞共榮主義。爲達到此目的，東亞民族必須以誠意一致團結，互助互惠，由共苦以求同甘，以共死而求同生，大東亞會議之目的，即基於此，充分發揮東方道義精神，使東亞各團結成一團同心戮心，以打破英美殖民主義之壓迫與榨取政策，使東亞各國國民，充實其獨立自主之愛國心，同時組織共存共榮之必要，東亞各國各以此根本精神爲基礎，一致協力，則大東亞戰爭必勝，大東亞共榮圈之建設必成。</p>
<p>自大東亞共同宣言發表到現在，已經一年，戰爭還一直繼續着，破壞中的建設，固然已在不斷中的努力，但就破壞而言，戰爭的劇烈有加無已，目前正是面臨着最緊急關頭，也就是東亞全民族生死存亡總力決戰的最後關頭，從最近英美積極在太平洋所進行反攻作戰的情勢看來，大東亞戰爭，最後決勝的序幕，顯見已經熱烈地揭開，一些淺見者流也許會以爲這不過是英美對日本的戰爭，敵人一直在採取「跳島作戰」的戰略，以期截斷聯絡包圍日本，並且運用其所謂「疲勞轟炸」「絨毯轟炸」的方式，妄冀騷擾後方威脅日本，同時更高唱其所謂「東亞第二戰綫」假藉中國領土爲其焦土作戰的基地，其目的衹在打擊日本而已。其實英美的企圖打擊日本，就是要宰制東亞奴隸東亞，也就是要焦土中國，犧牲中國，試問我們今日除了日本担任着保衛東亞的前鋒外，還有什麼可以抵抗英美侵略主義的肆處，我們焦土，我們犧牲，我們所得到的究竟是什麼？本來日本在太平洋上海陸空的實力，這幾年間正在加速地强大起來，構成了一個堅不可拔的鐵陳，英美宣傳了兩年多的反攻，其所以遲遲又久不敢大事發動，正是一種惶慮的躊躇，然而他們眼看日本實力雄厚了，大東亞各國的總覺悟甦醒了，他們在東亞的據點失掉了，挑撥離間的毒計也失效了，一切憑藉統統的動搖起來了，這樣不得不孤注一擲的蠢動起來，不惜勞師遠裂，冒險一試，他們以爲日本是東亞唯一的勁敵，擊破日本，即可以宰割整個東亞，奴隸整個東亞民族，一手掌握東亞的天下，而爲所欲爲，然而他們的冒險，他們的夢想，終竟要失敗，終竟要幻減的。我們衹要看最近中國大陸，以及台灣菲律賓各處的陸海戰爭，敵人是怎樣窮蹙，就可以瞭然一切了。中國大陸之戰，各要衝陷落以後，敵方重要航空基地，幾於全部毀減，台灣菲律賓海空戰，敵方艦隊幾於潰不成軍，道是事實給英美侵略主義者的答覆，在這種情勢中，敵美之最後掙扎，將是怎樣的焦躁，怎樣的拋窮，不難想像得之。此後戰爭之劇勢，必有加未已。</p>
<p>堅定必勝信念</p>
<p>爲着东亞的生死存亡，我們的努力是不能一絲松懈的，今日之事，必須竭大東亞整個的總力，以爭取最後之勝利，我們對於盟邦日本朝野上下萬眾一心，艱苦奮斗英勇果毅，一往無前，深致最大的敬意，也深感最大的興奮。切信盟邦日本朝野人士，必能一本大東亞共同宣言之精神，盡力援助東亞各國，俾能自動的運用其各自本身的力量，一涓一滴，以貫獻於大東亞戰爭。同時深信其他各友邦，亦必能堅定必勝之信念，與盟邦日本共同協力戰爭的完遂，各自以其本身的力量，毫無遺漏的貫獻於大東亞戰爭，爲各自的國家，爲整個的東亞，爭取自主與獨立。最後希望在英美侵略主義操縱壓制的地區以內的中國同胞，不要再受英美侵略主義的欺騙，而爲其所蒙蔽。我們起來，實現中日全面和平，我們起來，爭取東亞全體的解放，爭取中國的獨立自主，我們要生存要獨立自主，除了以總力赴敵，完遂大東亞戰爭，粉碎英美侵略主義決無其他的途徑。</p>
<p>我們更相信侵略主義者，如果一天不放棄其再侵略的野心，一天不停止其再侵略的冒險行動，東亞民族自由解放的怒潮，必定一天一天的高漲和澎湃起來，我們自由解放的意志，是任何勢力所不能阻撓的，我們奮戰的決心，是任何巧計所不能動搖的。</p>
<p>中國的同胞們！日本的盟友們！全東亞的同志們！我們大東亞十萬民眾，在今天惟有遵守我們共同的血誓，朝着面前勝利之光，竭盡總力，齊一步伐循着共同宣言的坦途，向前勇進！</p>

<p>代論</p>
<h3>大東亞共同宣言與大西洋憲章的比較</h3>
<p>— 李權時</p>
<p>昨日大東亞共同宣言周年紀念，本市新聞聯合會等五團體舉行紀念演講會，置請各國民間代表演講，中國代表爲李權時先生，茲將李先生講詞移載於此。—編者注</p>
<p>以本人的資格，代表我國民間發表大東亞共同宣言的感言，實不敢當。但正在大東亞戰爭決戰之際，欣逢此含有深長意義之紀念日，能與諸位一堂談話，亦爲欣幸之事。大東亞共同宣言，是東亞各國協力建設共同榮圈的精神表現，也是盟邦日本協助各國的表現。試以大東亞共同宣言之要義，與英美所謂之大西洋憲章，兩相比較，即可明白。</p>
<p>第一，大西洋憲章宣佈在一九四一年八月。依照進步原則，大東亞宣言自然優勝於大西洋憲章，這是就時間講，大東亞宣言比大西洋憲章爲光明。</p>
<p>第二，大西洋憲章發起國，衹有英美兩帝國主義，大東亞宣言發起國有東亞七國。這是就國數講，大東亞宣言比大西洋憲章爲光明。</p>
<p>第三，大西洋憲章雖然號稱有原則八條，但都是雞零狗碎的。大東亞宣言雖然衹有五個綱領，但條條都很重要，這是就內容講，大東亞宣言比大西洋憲章爲光明。</p>
<p>第四，大西洋憲章保證小國（如波籣等）的領土完整，但目前大勢所趨，恐怕波蘭的東南半壁勢將不保，所以憲章的精神已經破壞。大東亞宣言七國共同確保東亞的安定，相互尊重自主獨立及民族的傳統，是東亞道義的表現，這就實踐宣言的精神講，大東亞宣言比大西洋憲章爲光明。</p>
<p>第五，大西洋憲章八條原則中，列有兩條（即第四條與第五條）注意戰後國際經濟合作。大東亞宣言五個綱領中，也有兩個綱領（即第四個與第五個）注意戰後國際經濟合作。但是如果戰後英國不放棄其帝國特惠關稅，美國不放棄其國內極端保護關稅，那末所謂國際經濟合作，不過是騙騙人罷了。這是就將來宣言的全部實行的可能性講，大東亞宣言比大西洋憲章爲光明。</p>
<p>第六，大西洋憲章第六條宣稱，要打倒納粹主義，同時對於人種平等問題隻字不提。大東亞宣言第一條講共存共榮，第五條講萬邦親善，人種一律平等。這是就宣言的精神與含義講，大東亞宣言比大西洋憲章爲偉大。</p>
<p>我們就上面的幾個比較來觀察，就可以知道大東亞共同宣言，與英美的所謂大西洋憲章，根本不可同日而語。在今天紀念大東亞共同宣言之際，我們更應努力貫澈宣言的精神，俾從速實現大東亞各國家各民族的自主獨立，共存共榮。</p>
<h3>大東亞萬眾一心　共同建設新秩序　日首相闡明此次戰爭真意</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日小磯首相以六日爲大東亞共同宣言周年紀念日，特于六日下午七時三十分向大東亞各地作廣播演說，闡明此次戰爭從英美立場言，實係出師無名，其在日本則係自存自衛解放大東亞之戰爭。進一步來說，即一以重新建立世界秩序爲理想之聖戰，故最後勝利當屬於大東亞。其大意謂：×××</p>
<p>戰爭目的彼此不同</p>
<p>在此次大戰中，日本帝國與境遇立場相同之東亞各國，將其共同之戰爭目的，宣示世界後，迄今已歷週年。當此之時，東亞戰局顯已踏入決戰階段，時至今日，英美大發其達到制覇世界野心之夢想，對軸心國民則以永久征服及奴化以臨之，對東亞各民族則更强化其殖民地壓迫與榨取之行爲，且驅其本國軍隊犧牲於瘴癘之山野，或渺茫之海洋，甚至以人道上不容之罪惡，加諸本國民眾身上。此實爲日本帝國及大東亞各國之共同戰爭目的，與敵英美之戰爭目的，在根本上逈乎不同。此種不同之原因，將可證諸全世界之前，不寗惟是，英美國民對其本國有害無益之戰爭行爲，亦必將憬然覺悟，甚至反抗其本國之執政者，因之吾人相倍戰局之決定階段，將可踏入新的歷史過程，而其原因當係由於彼我戰爭目的逈乎不同之結果，與敵國官民行將對立有以致之。</p>
<p>宣言原則必使實現</p>
<p>蓋日本帝國所衷心希望者，係在排除世界上之政治專制與經濟獨佔，進而相互理解各自民族之意向，尊重各自國家之主權，藉此以實現互助互惠之國際關係，大東亞共同宣言，即是明示東亞具體原則之表現，而當東亞各國從其關係地域驅逐英美軍事勢力以後，東亞各國之所以得進而與日本帝國協力結成同盟關係，而站於對抗英美之共同戰綫上，此實由於東亞各國確信惟有排除英美壓制侵略，始得開拓自身自由解放之途有以使然。殆東亞各國脫離英美軍事勢力之桎梏後，今已展開新的國　民鬥爭，對抗英美再度侵略東亞，此實爲一堅守旣經確立之國家主權，與民族獨立之神聖戰爭。此次戰我叟旣以日本帝國自存自衛爲出發點，則其本看當能推展至所謂全東亞民族共同防衛更廣汎之目的爲止。</p>
<p>勝利信念堅定不移</p>
<p>日本帝國固不必論，即東亞各國實不僅爲各自擁護其獨立主權而戰，同時亦係爲重相互的獨立與主權而戰，故日本與東亞各國，其目的亦係在形成維持强力之共同戰綫，以對抗共同敵人英美。故日本帝國所擬樹立之和平基礎，並不僅限於東亞地域，且在使過去在世界上被壓迫被屈服之東亞，恢復其正常地位，以期使此種基礎，成爲世界和平之根基，故英美荀仍固執其奴化東亞民族，吞併東亞各國之博濵戰爭目的時，則日本帝國將必決心與之戰至最後。換言之，此即爲與日本國同其歷史運命之東亞各國所堅持之確同不移信念。在此生死存亡之鬥爭，吾人則深信東亞各國必能獲得光榮之最後勝利。</p>
<h3>印鮑斯主席　晋宮參竭</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　訪日之自由印度臨時政府主席鮑斯氏，爲對日本皇室表示敬意，六日上午一時半晋宮參謁於鳳凰間，謹述日本之仗義支援，恭致謝意，旋即惶恐辭出</p>
<h3>國民大會席上　重光演辭要旨　依基本國策運用外交</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日本大政翼贊會興亞總本部主辦之大東亞共同宣言周年紀念國民大會，六日下午在日比谷公會堂舉行，出席者計小磯首相以下各大臣·天東亞共榮圈各國大使·膠滯留東京之自由印度臨時政府主席鮑斯氏等。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　國民大會席上，日重光外相兼大東亞相演說要旨如次：英美兩國爲隱瞞國內矛盾，充實國防，送大兵於遠隔重洋之地，以遂其野心，作無謀之戰，但由於日軍之勇敢善戰，或在台灣海面或在菲律賓海面，予以慘重之打擊，其貴重之艦船與無數之生命，均等太平洋作戰之意圖，在永遠侵略亞洲，從事無限度之榨取，期使東亞自黎明之自覺，轉入黑暗之鬥爭。彼等對重慶許以戰，其實則在使中國軍事政治及經濟逐步遭受侵蝕，彼等謀使東亞人兩敗俱傷，以達成其野性，彼等違反正義，企圖獨佔制霸，永遠壓迫軸心各國，强令他國隨從自已之組織，各小國之利害，彼等略不顧盼。故吾同盟國爲與東亞相提携。粉碎敵人野心，實現正義之世界，乃從事聖戰。大東亞共同宣言簡潔而有力，乃明示大東亞戰爭之所由，解釋確立世界和平根本要意，以表明吾人決意，日本帝國策，運用外交，現東亞各國正依此共同宣言之精神努力奮鬥。大陸方面之滿洲國，首先以其工業設備及其天然豐富之資源貢獻東亞。爲復興大東亞基石之中化民國各要人，亦協助主席領導四億民眾，於東亞人之覺醒下，與各同盟國站於共同戰綫上，以同生共死之精神努力奮鬥，唯爲英美驅使利用之重慶政權，甘供敵人驅使，最近更頻受英美之唾罵，實爲近代一大奇觀。泰國方面於新進之阿巴溫首相領導下，新內閣已組織健全，更協力日本站於新生亞洲解放陳綫之最先頭。緬甸於巴莫國家代表指導下，於解放亞細亞陳綫之先頭，協力日軍作戰。至於菲律賓雖於敵美侵攻之下，仍毅然與日本於同一戰綫，於洛勒爾總統指揮下，協力日軍從事決戰，尤爲全世界所注目。此外印臨時政府鮑斯主席，以及今日出席本大會之印臨時政府諸君，亦率領多數印國民軍，爲達成解放印度之大業而奮戰，現以上均爲協力日本完遂戰爭，邁進實現大東亞共同宣言之亞細亞陳容。現敵英美正興其戰力，自東亞兩綫展開侵攻作戰，戰局日甚一日，即將突入決戰階段，東亞現已到達重大時機，幸日軍所獲赫赫戰果，正逐次擴大，故大東亞陳營必獲勝利之信念愈堅，吾人誓守鄉土，更以貫澈正義之主張，爲貢獻世界之永久和平，非達到此次作戰最後勝利不可，於此吾人決意與同盟之各國共同協力，獲得最後勝利。</p>
<h3>滿國務總理談話</h3>
<p>新京六日中央社電　滿洲張國務總經五晶發表談話如次：大東亞宣言崇高遠大，敵方宣傳之戰後和平機構，乃以欺瞞與謀略，攫取世界樹權，將各民族隷屬於其支配之下，以滿私慾之政策。戰爭之最後勝利，必降於正義人道者之頭上，此乃天意，且爲吾人堅固之信念。</p>
<h3>泰溫華親王談話</h3>
<p>盤谷六日中央社電　泰國溫華肯達亞親王，曾去年代表前首相畢本出席大東亞會議，四日上午十一時，於外部接見記者團發表談話。其大意謂：大東亞共同宣言闡明之五大原則，不僅爲鼓舞大東亞各民族之崇高理想，且爲規定共榮圈各國國際關係之大原則。泰國政府關於實現五大原則。泰國政府關於實現五大原則，始終適應現實，加强與日本協力，決以全力完成聖戰。</p>
<h3>菲大總統廣播詞</h3>
<p>馬尼刺六日中央社電　菲律賓洛勒爾大總統於六日大東亞共同宣言周年紀念日，下午八時舉行廣播，其大意如次：本人確信大東亞宣言，實爲人類進步之歷史的指路牌，大東亞共同宣言，乃全東亞民族史上最崇高之一章，吾等東亞民族，當於命運相同利害相關之認識下，振起團結精神。</p>
<h3>緬巴莫代表聲明</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　緬甸巴莫國家代表，當六日大東亞宣言周年紀念日之際，發表聲明如次：今日實爲東亞全體之「大東亞日」今後吾等必須推行共同宣言之一切任務，即第一，防衛敵方破壞吾人之東亞人應本諸自由平等公正及互惠之諸原則，建設生活安樂之東亞新世界。</p>

<p>馬尼刺六日中央社電　此次敵美在菲島作戰，陷於徬徨焦灼不安之途，其空母勢力，由於後方前進空軍基地之弱化及台灣海面機動部隊勢力之潰減，已隨之損失殆盡，同時最重要之制空權，亦不能據爲已有，目下正謀由新幾內亞增援中。據敵方向雷伊泰大藩市以無綫電台解說者文　於三十一日廣播稱：此次菲島作戰困難重重，理由有三，（一）菲島日軍兵力至爲强大，（二）日空軍反擊力之熾烈，實出意料，（三）日軍各據點防備堅固。</p>

<p>旅行通信</p>
<h3>大團一日遊</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>由南匯城前往大團鎮，路綫計三：蓋陸行除乘沿公路駛行之卡車外，可抄近道　，步行前去。水路則可在東門外雇民船順河而下。記者爲時間經濟起見，於十月二十八日下午一時半出南門搭卡車，車由周浦鎮開來，至此乘客一忝半下車，故車內不若來時擁擠，但公路則較前段更形傾斜，致順簸之程度，較前爲甚。從此車向東直駛，旋折入護海塘，改向南行，兩旁屋宇，類皆茅舍，瓦房較少，間有一二宛如鶴立雞羣之高大瓦房，築有堡壘，頗引人觸目。經詢諸同行者，始悉此乃該地大地主之居處，而茅草小屋，則爲一般貧農與佃農之安身處也。此輩即記者初次通信中提及之崇明啓東餘姚一帶鄉民移墾至此者。田中農民男女雜陳，頗行忙碌，蓋時屆麥子下種期，此間農婦有一特色，即皆腦後拖有三千類惱絲，而若城中婦女秀髪付諸並州一剪者，未之見也。車過時，皆不加注意，耕作如故，其安閒之態度，與古樸之服裝，大有不知有漢無論魏晋之槪。約有一句鍾，車抵大團鎮。</p>
<p>（市廛一瞥）</p>
<p>大團爲南匯縣之第二大鎮，其商業狀况僅次於周浦，街市成一字形，南北長約四里，街道雖狹，但較縣城整潔，兩旁商肆櫛比，行人熙攘，營業大都以日用品爲主，當地之土布，遐邇皆知，花色繁多，質地堅固，案負盛名，皆本鎮婦女，自紡自織者，亦爲主要之農家副業，其對調濟農村經濟上之貢獻殊大。除此，尚有一土法造紙廠，出品推銷各鄉，衹惜以墨守陳法，兼以資本欠足，不易發展耳，出口貨，以棉花爲大宗，其中花行以祥盛花行爲巨擘。推銷地以海爲首。</p>
<p>（社會風光）</p>
<p>大國社會情形，與男女在社會上地位論，頗與他處不同。蓋女子十九身體壯健，吃苦耐勞，工作至爲繁重，不愧爲巾幗英雄，農村生產者之健將，與一般都市女子。整天「飽食終日，無所用心」，專在抹粉塗脂美容方面下工夫，閒來衛生麻雀八圈，不事生產，甘作寄生是者，所右擬比。男子則至爲閒散，頗有過去北京八旗子弟之作風，坆此間茶樓酒館，經常客滿，營業至爲鼎盛。</p>
<p>（賭煙熱鬧）</p>
<p>大團賭風之盛，冠於全縣，其輸嬴籌碼之大，實屬駭人聽聞，一局之數，非記者過甚其辭，數十萬元，司空見慣，不足爲奇。即滬上流行之所謂新法麻將，種種花　色，亦皆發明於大團鎮。記者住於道派，與店主談及木地賭風，得悉參加之賭徒，十九爲各鄉農民，每於四五月間將收獲之農作物出售後所得之款，充作賭本，大賭一陳，決不顧惜血汗易來之金錢。平日勝負，皆用籌碼計數，終局後，則由負者簽出一張支票作爲信證。故每有農家衹有薄田三五畝，致負款竟達百萬元者，屆時無法等款抵付，衹得逃亡，傾家敗產，數見不鮮。此單大規模豪賭窟，泰半皆在冷落鄉村中，每晚流動遷移，且有特殊勢力爲之撐腰，故縣府雖在申五令嚴禁，結果不易肅清。</p>
<p>煙毒與嗎啡，本處沿海各鄉，其勢至爲猖獗，雖婦人孺子染有嗜好者比比皆是。煙毒與豪賭兩項，其爲害農村之生產，及鄉村治安方面之大，實應加以重視。深望當局。能具最大之決心，着手掃蕩，庶幾始能談復興農村，確立治安。</p>
<p>（金融治安）</p>
<p>當地金融界衹有啓昌與浦東兩銀號，資本皆三百萬元，主要業務，爲貼現與滙劃，規模不大，對農村之貢獻，實至微也。</p>
<p>治安方面，鎮上軍力雄厚，除友軍外，保安第四中隊及警察特務隊，現任入區長顧明氏即爲警察特務隊大隊附，此公並兼縣立一中校長，可稱軍敎一元化政也。</p>
<p>（敎育槪況）</p>
<p>大團鎮有初級中學二所，區長顧明兼第一中學校長，因其身兼多職，忙碌異常，故不常駐校，但平素對敎育至爲熱心。該校敎師待遇，較其他公立學校爲優，校中支出，除公款外，不足之數皆由其私人籌措，故敎師等不虞三餐之不繼，頗能安心服務，成績斐然。另一爲私立東海中學，經費四百萬，其來源爲該鄉旅滬紳商所捐募，記者參觀時，見該校學生一律皆衣土產布制服，頗爲壯觀。兩校共計一百餘人，以記者之私見，兩校似宜合而爲一，經費旣可節省，而效率亦可增加。小學共有三處，爲大團，荻生，東海三校，共計學生七百餘人，記者按此問學校密度，較他區爲稀，似覺美中不足，頗有發展之必要次日記者雇小舟返城。（舟返南城）（因卡車衹上午七時一班），兩地相隔，僅念四里，舟子竟索價四百金。記者以其價過高，有難意，而舟子尚喃喃不休，據云四百金，衹能購米四斤，僅足兩口一日之飽。嗟乎！物價不設法抑平，空談安定民生，豈非背道而馳。以時近黃昏，故聽之，舟身大僅容身，側身其間，不敢彈動，衹聞槳櫓撥水之聲，仰望天際，長空如洗，兩岸蘆葦迎風瀟瀟，不覺令人陶醉於大自然之懷抱中矣。以奔走竟日，疲倦不堪，終至昏昏而睡，一覺醒來，已抵南城之東關外，捨舟登岸，入城時，已萬家燈火矣。</p>

<h3>松平部長談　渝美關侮惡化　親美派態度頗堪注意</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使記上海惡化極點。</p>
<p>事務所報這常會，昨（六）日下午三時假華懋飯店舉行，由松平情報部長就渝蔣與天史蒂威爾發生意見事發表談話如次：（十月二十三日本人指出美國內興論對渝方深感不滿，情勢惡化，且猛烈攻訐重慶政治不良，而駐渝大使高斯竟又提出强硬要求，干涉渝內政，於此可見美對渝政權之壓迫愈見益甚。十月二十八日美白宮發表史蒂威爾之調回狀况越日，又頻傅高斯大使辭職，如此情形，渝美關係已</p>
<p>量美裏次動搖原因，據羅斯福總裁自稱，說問題實爲蔣史兩人之個人關係，惟英美及中立國報章通訊莫不重視異常，不但認爲個人問題，實乃嚴重之政治原因。尤其據三十一日美聯社紐的電稱：當初史蒂威爾向蔣介石之要求，有問題三個；（一）任命史爲渝聯合軍最高指揮官，並給與史武器分配權。（二）渝軍內部徹底底改組。（三）渝國民黨與中共應予協調並調整單事統一，查此項要求並非史高二人所欲提出者，其問　即爲羅斯福總統所指仗，易言之，即美國乃欲將渝軍政作　一步之控制，其起因實庄於日軍攻擊豫湘桂之後而起，引起美國之不滿，乃求達到共野心，蔣介石因此關中國之命運，對本身之標榜獨立自主有整個之崩潰趨勢，乃嚴加拒絕，結果高史兩人引退，渝方目前仍暫時維持原來之意見，遐免本身不利，但頑强之美國，仍以硬軟手段，始終企圖實現其目的，吾人故須嚴密注意親美派孔詳熈宋子文宋子良宋美齡魏　明董照光等之態度」</p>

<h3>中央市塲　自行撤消定價　物價評議會議決</h3>
<p>本市物假評議委員會於本月四日下午三時在市經濟局會護室召開第十二次委員會議，出席委員袁　昌，馮攸，羅訥齋，孫仲立，徐天深，戴藹盧，劉煒俊，潘達，陳國權，陳彬龢，或代表等十餘人，並由中央市場代表安齋金治，劉覺真，會子仁列席參加，首由主席徐主任委員天深報吿抑平物價經過情形，繼即開始討論，茲將重要議決案探錄如次：</p>
<p>（一）本會對於各統制機關各市場及軍管理物品之評定價格應如何取得密切聯絡俾統一本市物價管理請公泱案。議決，由各生管機關指派負責人員與本會秘書隨時聯絡。</p>
<p>（二）關於中央市場地貨蔬菜等評價物品均屬不能久置易於腐爛之鮮貨，前經本會第四次會議議泱授權主任委員先予核定公布，於每次會議時彙提本會追任在卷，茲查公定價格品目表內尚有魚類肉類蛋類等物品，均屬鮮貨，性質相同，擬援照中央市場前案同樣辦理，當衆請公決案，議決通過，關於魚類肉類蛋類等易於腐爛之物依照第四次會議議決案辦理。</p>
<p>（本）准經濟局轉本市油糧統制委員會函，以本會評定油糧價格內有按照配給價核定者，與普通市售價格相相差甚遠，在未經該會核定以前，請暫緩執行等由，經函復請其迅速百行調整見復在案，惟查除油糧以外，類似此項情形者尚多，應否一律請各王管機關迅速核定合理價格，以便評定公布，請公決案。議決兩請各主管機關自行調整送由本會評定公布。</p>
<p>（四）本會第十一次會議議泱評定之公定價格公布後，各種商品價格，尚維特原定價格，惟中央市場又於十一月一日在報紙發表蔬菜地貨南北貨等物品價格，核與本會第四次會議議決案不合，頗引起人民誤會，本會對此應如何辦理之處，請公決案。議決，除由該市場自行登報撤銷外，嗣後評價須經本會通過或主任委員核定，始能公布。</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>整稅之這</h3>
<p>我們竭力張革新市政，提高公務人員待遇，增進行政效率。當然，不能提高公務人員待遇，則什麼增進行政效率，什麼革新市政，都昌空談。而提高待遇，自不能憑空做到，嚴要者當然是充實經費。現在市府組織的市稅整理委員會，已經數四时論整稅問題，聞已漸有成　，願拭目以觀其成就。在這裏我們先真瞅若干意見如次：</p>
<p>（一）微收回力球及園拘塲的門券稅，自從南市的賭博塲所取締以後，對於回力球與胞狗兩種外國式賭博　應同時取締，但因稅收及其特殊購潔仍復存在，這巳長遷就環境了，但對讓兩塲僅客進場收取門券，酌徵捐稅自屬無妨，聰說訽狗場負責的法藉人士反對此事，以爲足以減少營業，道是完全站在法　少數人利益的立場而忽視中國政府與人民的公利。那末，政府緃或爲了特殊約定而遷就事實，可是‘我們市民却有共同制裁的權能。難道根本無顧客進場以後，營業又怎能維持呢？所以，我們要促起跑狗場法藉人士的警覺，不能過於重視私利，忽略了中國人的全利，引起追悔不及的後果。</p>
<p>（二）開徵特種娛樂稅，如旅館，書寓，俱樂部等處之打麻將，規定每局微稅若干。其他一切有關奢侈的消耗，均應酌予徵稅，取之貸不傷廠。</p>
<p>體系</p>
<h3>三冷飲福利足球賽　劃聯戰滬警</h3>

<p>英美勢力　侵略東亞　中日兩國，不論從歷史上看，從地理上看，從人種上看，　從文化上看，都有密切不分的關係，這是各位已經十分知道的。然則中日兩民族近年來何故會彼此衝突，而從事互相流血的戰爭呢？想起來實在令人遺憾萬分！不但可憾，並且從大的方面看，也可以說是東亞的悲劇。這募東亞的悲劇爲何發生的呢？原因有許多，眞是一言難盡，其中有幾分是日本人的責任，也有幾分是中國人的責任。爲欲避免這幕東亞的悲劇，而努力改善中日兩國的關係，希望確立理想的善鄰友好關係的人士，確然爲數不多，但是在中國和日本都是有的。例如貴國的張之洞先生，劉坤一先生，及孫文先生，便是其中的代表人物，而日本方面的荒尾精先生，根津一先生及不久以前過世的頭山滿先生，也是其代表者。可是中日兩國的道些偉人們，雖然努力，結果仍吿失敗而發生了東亞的悲劇。這是什麼道理呢？其原因何在？據鄙人想來，當時中日兩方，在賢人士中，固然有上面所講的偉大人物和先覺者，但在朝的，就是在政府辦事的，却沒有大政治家，而圍民又未會充分明白世界的大勢。不過，這在比率上還是很小的原因，大的原因還在別處呷。諸君，它是什麼呢？你們一定知道。那就是英美侵略東亞的勢力龐大。這一點，想必今日已無須在各位而前詳述了，爲什麼呢？因爲諸君已經很明白了，各位知道鴉片戰爭是怎樣一回事嗎？英國的茶大政治家曾經說過：「沒有別的戰爭再比鴉片戰爭更露骨地暴露英國的不道德了」。自己犯了罪惡的英國人，也親口說出那是極不道德的戰爭。就算不是林則徐先生，換了別人也會不勝其痛憤的吧。要之，英國是在政治上領土上，着着從事侵略中國，侵略東亞，日本看到這種情形，對內則斷然實行明治維新，整頓國事，對外則與中國協力，努力爲了保衛東亞而打算掃淸敵人英美勢力。爲什麼要這樣呢？因爲中國第一被英美侵略，其决輪到受地們侵略的，將是日本呀。所以在明治四年七月，就是一八七一年，中國和日本之間訂下了修好條約及通商協定，這是中日兩國完全站在平等立場上　結的條約。</p>
<p>陰謀離間　中日提携　這時，英美正對中國伸出魔掌，着着侵略，不但訂立不平等條約，擴充租界勢力，甚而至於還計劃瓜分中國。同時在他方面，爲了阻撓日本與中國提携，以防反抗他們起見，巧妙施行離間日本和中國的政策。不幸得很，他們的陰謀竟吿成功，日本和淸朝的戰爭，也就是中了他們詭計的緣故。此戰的結果，訂立了下關條約，在這條約中，開始有最專團的條款，中日兩國間於是也有了不平等倏約，可是，這和英美與淸廷締結好苛酷的不平等條約比較，選算是輕的。自此以後，英美對中國的侵略，越加厲害，日本也不得不和英美對抗，於是在形式上，造成了日本也和英美一樣壓迫中國的結果。這真是遺憾之至的事！這樣，中日兩國的關係，越來越壞，再加英美又從中煽動，挑撥中日兩國，結局釀成了今日這種東亞的悲劇。總而言之，中日兩國的互相敵視，可說完全是英美侵略東亞的結果。</p>
<p>東亞黎明終於來臨　但是，東亞的黎明終於來了，這便是大東亞戰爭的揭幕。諸君，在這大東亞戰爭中，日本已將大東亞圈內的英美侵略勢力一掃而空，同時日本對華交還租界，撤慶活外法權，最近締結中日同盟，來代替中日基本條約，同時放棄各種附屬文雷，假使日本另有作用，決不肯放棄治外法權及一切利益，於此也可證明日本的道義精神了。一方面孫中山先生提倡的大亞洲主義，也已大部成就。中日兩大民族的提携，是英美最頭痛的事情，最反對的事情。現在，不但中日兩國的關係已經如此，而且日本還承認菲律賓，緬甸獨立，盡力援助努力解放印度的江時拉鮑斯氏，組成印度臨時政府，允許東印度羣鳥在將來也可獨立。大東亞宣言是這樣着着實行了，這是什麼緣故呢？因爲英美的勢力，已彼掃除了。</p>
<p>最後勝利奠定基礎　可是，要想破壞這種大東亞和平建設的英美，現在正用全力攻擊着。不過，各位，日本正和中國以下大東亞各盟邦及滿洲的盟邦共同盡力擊碎英美，而最後勝利的基礎，也已奠定了。不問英美如何强大，我們爲了達到我們的理想，爲了實踐我們解放東亞的信念，我們一定要戰下去，有了理想和信念的戰爭，一定會打勝的，事實勝於雄辯，台灣東方海面的大戰果，菲律賓東方海面及雷伊泰凝的大戰果，不是很好的證據嗎？當此大東亞宣言發表一周年紀念日，在下與各位一同衷心慶祝這個紀念日，並且祈望完成東亞解放之日早早來臨。</p>
<p>滿州國代表劉桂演詞</p>
<p>親邦日本領導大東亞戰爭，業已突入決戰階級，陸海空軍俱獲赫赫戰果，今天舉行大東亞共同宣售一周年紀念祝賀會之際，本人得以參加盛典，並能聊申所懷，實深榮幸。回想，英美敵人，機械革命之發展，在世界史五千年中，其爲期僅爲最近之一百五十年來，過去在大東亞民族中，如匈奴，蒙古，土耳其，印度等等，亦曾有踏入歌洲大睦的史實，故事實上決非如歐美人所自負自大者，以爲白種人乃世界之指導者，可恣意闖踏大東亞各地，實行彼等調責，繪圖，片面交易，或種種非人道不平等之侵略手段，以對待我們大東亞民族。敵人美英且美其名爲「保護」我等，爲我等開拓所謂「幸福」，彼等所謂「保護」，實則乃將我等之大東亞土地，化爲彼等之殖民地。或變爲彼等决殖民地而已。敵人美英殘踏我大東亞土地，敢於我東亞民族之前，以驕狂無恥之言辭，侮辱我東亞民族，實爲我人所深痛之恥恨。故大東亞聖戰之責任，應由大東亞的各個國家，各個民族，一致奮起，駢肩作戰，和親邦日本帝國打或一片，拘決死必勝之信念，周廿共苦，爭取最後勝利。本人代表滿洲國國民披　億萬一心之決意，蓄向完在大東亞共同宣言之本旨，動力適進。</p>
<p>菲律賓代表魏賢演詞</p>
<p>諸位同胞，一年前的今天，大東亞共榮圈七國最高領袖，締結隆重盟約，宣誓永久合作與協力，以建立東亞的新秩序，新秩序根據五大原則，就是共存共榮，獨立親睦，闡揚文化，發展經濟繁榮，及貢獻於世界的和平。</p>
<p>一年前的今天，這些自由獨立的國家，在日本勇敢的領導下，太東亞人的眞心誠意，舉行會議，剔除相互間少數的歧異，一掃過去西方帝國主義者所搬弄的是非。</p>
<p>一年以前，我們這些被壓迫的東亞大國，從昏睡中醒來，而發現共同的靈魂，這個靈魂，經幾百年來，被貪得無嬮之英美所分化和破壞，幾已完全消失。</p>
<p>一年前的今天，幾憶萬的亞洲人，自英美財閥手中解放出來，以前所未有之歡欣，迎接日本東京方面傳來歷史性的大東亞宣言，並矢願赤心忠膽保衛他們神聖的土地，防止英美帝國主義之侵害，在必要時，我們不惜犧牲性命，免使日本給予我們新近成立親陸和諒解的約束，受到妨害。</p>
<p>共同宣言意義深遠　共同宣言，對於日本人民，是日本努力於團結亞洲各國的適當表現。對於中國人民，是一掃從前半殖民地的地位，但是對於菲律賓人民，意義更爲深長遠大。這是眞正的大憲章，使菲律律賓終於脫離奴役，回復到舊時東亞的懷抱。東方本是我們生長之地，四百年來·菲律賓人民，爲爭取自由，不斷戰爭，先向西班牙戰爭，後又和美國戰爭，數百年來，菲律賓人民以高貴的傳統，都被美國亳無憐惜地糟塌了，文化方面旣擋不住侵略，經濟方面情形更壞，在美國政權壓迫下，菲律賓的經濟完全擊於紐約華爾街的投機家之手中，美國從未想到改善菲律賓的工業，因爲恐怕它將來要和美國的工業競爭，美國的金元，是校死菲律資人民獨立的十字架。</p>
<p>自由獨立今已實現　但是到今天，菲律賓人民吸到新時代的會勇氣息，充滿新鮮的理想，想到他們現在是一個獨立國，能够支配其自身的命運，實踐整個大東亞共榮圈共同目標的神聖原則，實是引爲榮耀的了。過去，菲律賓是沒有自由和獨立，現在他們有自由和獨立了，過去菲律賓完全處於被動地位，它的文化被美國民族所支配，現在正從破碎片中，綴起固有優美的文化，過去，在經濟上不能獨立，現在它雖然還脆弱，但是却能努力倚賴自身，與亞洲兄弟們人口作，創造它自身的命運。因爲菲律賓人民深切明瞭大東亞共同宣言所包含的敎義，菲律賓國是與它天然的，居兄弟國家，敦睦和洽共同努力，所以一年前發表這個偉大的文件，今日正被全東亞人民紀念着，將當作聖經看待。我們在向英美帝國主義進軍的時候，將共同從其中取得敎訓和靈魂，它必須和全東亞靑少年的政治敎育制度，密切結合着，它必須作爲闡掦文化的基礎，以便全亞洲人民間流行的種種思潮，沿此正確的方向進行，正和我們菲律賓的傳統相符合。這重意義必須向工業界領袖宣揚，作爲其管理企業的工具。從演說臺上，舞臺上，戲院裏，</p>
<p>學校裏，對於大東亞宣言的意義，必須鼓吹，如是則在若干年後，亞洲人的心裏上，灌注着一種廣大的愛國主義思想，貢獻於整個共榮圈福利的建設。</p>
<p>保衛組國神聖領土　現在日本友人正進行戰爭，將美國侵略者驅逐出菲律賓海岸的時候，菲律賓逢到一次嚴格試騐，菲律賓政府在賢明强幹的領袖洛勒爾大總統領導下，深得人民的尊敬和信仰，政府和人民間合作，爲了國家的體面，爲了共榮圈的主張，誓死保衛祖宗傳下來的神聖領土，這塊土地上，曾洒過英雄和烈士們的鮮血，我們將更有一代的烈士，但不單爲了菲律賓，本身的主張，同時並爲了共榮圈的主張。</p>

<h3>五團體紀念演講會　（自第三版轉來）</h3>
<p>現在美國要想回到菲律賓，踐踏菲律賓領土，美國軍隊企國重行征服菲律賓，雷伊泰方面正展開壯烈戰爭，但因爲美國師出無名，所以不會得到到勝利。四十年來，美國不能給菲律賓獨立，這次他們藉口替菲人，解脫日本的統治，而再度侵入菲律賓一海岸，美國政府與人民如慷慨爲懷，給我們獨立，我們將永久做他們的負責人，另一方面，日本政府不待我們申請，毫無的束的給菲律賓以自由獨立，菲律賓人民，因此感激非常，菲律賓領導者因懷有這種情緒，決定和美國斷絕一切關係，菲律賓人極願和日本中國印度泰國馬來，及共榮圈其他各民族，敦睦邦交，但我所要問的是，我們對於樹立密切的交誼或是享受共同的繁榮，或是普及東方固有文化，或是宣揚自由與敎睦有吾成就，如果沒有，我們就應該從今天起，從新獻身於這個亞洲民族共同的主張，不要私自感情衝動，要互相援助，我們要死一起死，活一起活。</p>
<h3>印代表那合克江特詞</h3>
<p>今天是大東亞共同宣言一周年紀念日，兄弟得能向諸君說話，眞是榮幸</p>
<p>一年前的今天，由日本東京，傅來共同宣言的消息，給予大東亞各國樹立永久繁榮與和平的努力目標。這個宣言，是日本前首相東條將軍發起的，東條前首相對於東亞各國過去和現在的發展，必然經過精密之考慮，則推測到各國未來的命運，得到了這正確的努力目標。</p>
<p>英帝國主義的摧殘　印度受到英國的摧殘，約有兩百年之久。英國資意搜括，以飽私囊，消減印度文化，而推行英國式的所謂「文明」，甚至對於印度偉大的歷史，也想一槪採殺。他們使印度人民陷於貧苦，這樣他們就能得到廉價的工人，供他利用，英國爲保持其在全世界的優秀地位，發行軍事公債，把印度的資源吸收殆盡，結果印度成爲一個苦力國家，只爲替英國主人掙錢，同時也成爲英帝國的雇工和工役。</p>
<p>緬甸於過去六十年來，在英國統治下，受到奇恥大辱。它的森林和礦產等等，都流到英國市場去，緬甸人民也像印度人一樣，成爲懇地的農夫，替它的英國主人發財，　了我們有力盟邦日本，緬甸才僥倖重得生存的權利。</p>
<p>再說菲列濱，當初西班牙人藉口宣揚基督敎，其實際行動，都在强搶掠奪，後來美國人來了，自稱是菲列濱的救星，赶跑了西班牙人，而開始有　　的掠奪資源，無形中枝縱了菲列濱人的生命線，一現在菲列濱人已享受到完全的自由和獨立，對於日本政府的善意，和崇高的犧牲，眞是感激。</p>
<p>被通知國家的痛苦　其他被統治的國家，也遭肥受到同樣痛苦，譬如說中國，英國人知道中國土地廣大不易吞咽，於是就像惡魔一般兇狠，肆其破壞和毒化的工作，用武力輸入鴉片烟，並實施恥辱的條的，以營私利，使中國在財政上和政治上，都處於奴化的地位，後來美國人出現了，和中央國人勾結一起，共同剝削中國豐富的資源，現在害蟲已被　除，中國在國民政府領導之下，正向復與之途邁進。</p>
<p>至於日三，則和其他國家不同，日本有深謀遠慮，阻止魔鬼在其土地散佈南種，得到非常成功，故近百年來，日本成爲世界一大强國，享受和平繁榮和敦睦。</p>
<p>大東亞各國現已展開一新時代，英美勢力驅逐後，和平與繁榮有望，日本居於領導地位，使那些從前遭受掠奪的國家恢復和平。</p>
<p>十億民族從此解放　日本不單顧到大東亞的和平，同時它的主要目標，是在切實樹立世界和平，日本檢討被統治各國過去和現在的不幸，得到一個結論，就是大東亞各國間，必須有一種團結，而互相協力。</p>
<p>十萬的東亞民族過王一曾經受到束縛，現在已從英美的銷　中解放。現在澄次遍及全世界的戰爭，眞是歷史上從來未有，所以大東亞戰爭，實在是解放整個亞洲大陸的戰爭。現在時機已近，東亞全民族運動，有努力必有成就，東亞的新秩序和世界的新秩序，是一而二，二而一的，日本皇軍所給予敵人致命的打擊，日本陸海空軍的勳績，是全東亞民族所稱頌的，也是全世界大陸所贊嘆的。</p>
<p>最後，我想爲印度說幾句話，印度愛國志士，人人知道這是脫離央國壓迫最好的時機，大東亞好比是一個大家庭，家庭中的各人和衷共濟，所以大東亞各國，都要以同樣家庭爲念，我們必須交換思想和意見，相互維持熱烈的友誼，而帮助別人，是爲各自的義務。</p>

<h3>National Government Acting Chairman Chen Hosts Diplomatic Envoys Yesterday, Expounding on the Important Mission of the Greater East Asia Declaration</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – The 6th marked the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Chen, the acting chairman of the National Government, hosted a banquet at the International Club at 7 PM to entertain diplomatic envoys from various countries to China. Those in attendance included Ambassador Tani, Minister Horiuchi, Lieutenant General Maeda, Major General Konoe, Mr. Matsumura, Mr. Ota, Mr. Kishi, Secretary Shimizu, Secretary Ishiguro, Councilor Zhang from the Manchurian Embassy, Councilor Ito, Military Attaché Tong, Secretary Ding, Ambassador of the Grand Alliance Wellman Gingery, Consul Bockim, Secretary Ling, Military Attaché Reilly, Italian Chargé d'Affaires Spinelli, Military Attaché Baikgaifu, as well as President Zhou, Foreign Minister Chu, Propaganda Minister Lin, Chief Secretary Xu, Deputy Secretary-General Xue of the Executive Yuan, President Chen of National Central University, Secretary Fan of the Legislative Yuan, Director Zhu of the Military Affairs Bureau, Director Ma of the Central Reserve Bank, and from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister Zhang, Director Chen, Director Fan, Director Xu, etc. During the banquet, Acting Chairman Chen delivered a speech, after which he raised a toast. Ambassador Tani then delivered a response on behalf of the guests. Finally, everyone raised their glasses to wish for the complete victory of the Greater East Asia War, the realization of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and to congratulate the development of the Chinese National Government. The guests and hosts enjoyed a very pleasant atmosphere until around 8 PM.</p>
<p>Acting Chairman Chen’s Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – Ambassador Tani, esteemed guests, today is the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. I am delighted by your presence. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is an unprecedented and epoch-making great undertaking in the history of Greater East Asia, the foundation for overall peace in Greater East Asia, and the foundation for the overall liberation of Greater East Asia. This is what we should express our respect and gratitude to Japan for today. As for China itself, since participating in the Greater East Asia War on January 9th last year, following Chairman Wang's instructions, we have been unswerving in our determination to share hardships and seek common prosperity, to share death and seek common life. No matter how difficult the war or how urgent the situation, we stand firm, cooperating with Japan to achieve victory. What China believes in is righteousness, and what it seeks is liberation. Apart from these, success or failure, profit or loss, are not considered. This we can be confident in, and hope that it is what all the peoples of Greater East Asia believe in. Recently, Japan has achieved unprecedented victories in land, sea, and air battles, which has brought boundless joy to all the peoples of Greater East Asia. We believe that with hundreds of millions of people united as one, we can overcome all enemies and break through all defenses. In the future, we will not only drive Anglo-American imperialism out of Greater East Asia, but also prevent any imperialism from reviving. This is the important meaning of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and the important mission of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Today, on this important anniversary, is not only a day of joy for the Chinese people, but also for all the hundreds of millions of people in Greater East Asia. The complete victory of the Greater East Asia War is imminent. I raise my glass to wish you all good health, and to celebrate the victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Ambassador Tani's Response</p>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – Ambassador Tani, in his reply at the banquet hosted by Acting Chairman Chen, stated the following: The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has announced the significance of the Greater East Asia War to the world, and the noble mission of the Greater East Asia War is fully demonstrated in this declaration. The Greater East Asia Declaration is a charter for the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia to develop individually and then seek common development and common liberation. In contrast, the Anglo-American conferences have always aimed to exclude dissidents, which is vastly different from the Greater East Asia Declaration. Moreover, this war is a war for the survival of all the peoples of the world. In the various battles, the Japanese army has achieved great victories. The recent victories of the Japanese army in the Taiwan and Philippine seas further prove that the Japanese army has secured the victory. Japan is currently cooperating with various countries to complete the war based on the five principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration, which is truly admirable. Here, I would like to borrow the host's wine to wish for the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the development of your government.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Koiso of Japan Sends Congratulatory Telegrams to Various Countries</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Today (the 6th) marks the anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Prime Minister Koiso of Japan sent a telegram to Premier Zhou of our country's Executive Yuan to express mutual congratulations, and also sent telegrams to the authorities of Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, and the Philippines to express his congratulations.</p>
<h3>Strive for Freedom and Independence for the Entire Greater East Asia – Broadcast Speech by Acting Chairman Chen</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – On the 6th, the anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, Acting Chairman Chen delivered a broadcast speech in the evening. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>On November 6th last year, following the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the countries of Greater East Asia, in order to coordinate the completion of the Greater East Asia War and build a new order in East Asia, held the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo to jointly strive and achieve common goals. The attendees included representatives from China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, the Philippines, and Burma, as well as the Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, representing the hundreds of millions of people in Greater East Asia, and commencing an unprecedented meeting in the history of East Asia. On the first day, the representatives of the countries respectively stated their determination to complete the Greater East Asia War and build Greater East Asia. On the second day, with a unanimous resolution, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the essence of the conference, was issued. This declaration is a great charter in which the peoples of Greater East Asia place their highest belief in world peace, and also a vow that the peoples of Greater East Asia will abide by unswervingly.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the deeply rooted evil forces of Anglo-American aggression have gradually been driven out of the East Asian region, the original appearance of Greater East Asia has been restored, and all past misunderstandings and estrangements between East Asian countries have been eliminated due to the alignment of external interests. The instigation and discord sown by Anglo-American aggression were the main factors in the various grievances between East Asian peoples. Once they are completely eliminated, the natural and potential friendship and sincerity among East Asian peoples, due to historical and geographical relations, immediately reappear. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is the total crystallization of this friendly sincerity.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Declaration's Contents</p>
<p>The content of the Greater East Asia Declaration, the first paragraph points out the fundamental meaning of establishing world peace, the second paragraph points out the cause of the Greater East Asia War, the third paragraph points out the determination to complete the war and complete construction, and the fourth paragraph points out the program for the construction of Greater East Asia. The first article of the program is to establish the common goal of coexistence and co-prosperity. The second article is to establish the political principle of independent autonomy, mutual assistance and amity. The third article is to establish the cultural principle of respecting tradition, developing national creativity. The fourth article is to establish the economic principle of mutual benefit and cooperation, and common prosperity. The fifth article is to establish the world ideal of harmony among all nations, abolishing racial discrimination, promoting communication of culture, and opening up resources. Over the years, the four major programs of political independence, military alliance, economic cooperation, and cultural communication that we have put forward have now been more concretely established with the guidance of our ally Japan and the overall support of the countries of Greater East Asia. And the Pan-Asianism advocated by the Founding Father has also obtained the opportunity for realization. From the content of the declaration, we can clearly understand the purpose of our ally Japan, which is to fully assume the vanguard of the Greater East Asia War, drive out the forces of Anglo-American aggression, and seek the overall liberation of East Asia, so that all countries that have been invaded by Anglo-American countries can be independent and autonomous, and cooperate with each other. This great spirit of righteousness is inherent in the East, but in the past, it was not able to express itself due to the machinations of Anglo-American aggression. Now it can extend its inherent free will and express itself fully.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, before the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, our ally Japan had proven with facts that it was committed to assisting the independence and autonomy of the peoples of East Asia. For example, China's recovery of concessions and abolition of extraterritorial rights, Burma's independence, and the Philippines' independence are all seen by people around the world. After the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, our ally Japan has been even more active in this effort. For example, assisting the Indian National Army to carry out the struggle for national revival, and assisting the Philippines and Burma to resist the invasion of aggressors, are the most prominent examples.</p>
<p>From the content of the declaration, we must also be clear about the just demands and expectations of the countries of East Asia for world peace. We are fighting for survival and for self-defense. Our ultimate goal is peace, and the main task of war is also peace. In order to guarantee peace, we have no choice but to eliminate the obstacles to peace. The peace we demand is not only for East Asia, but also for the world. Racial discrimination is the cause of national hatred and must be abolished. Resource monopolies are the fuse for the struggle for survival and are also unacceptable to us. At the time when the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was discussed and issued, Chairman Wang said: "The characteristic of this declaration lies in revealing the Eastern spirit of righteousness and sweeping away the utilitarian views of the West. In more detail, it is to fundamentally eliminate the traditional policy of Anglo-American plunder and exploitation, and to reopen up a new world of coexistence and co-prosperity in East Asia... In this way, the countries of East Asia will inevitably move towards sincere unity, so that national interests and people's welfare will increase day by day, and at the same time, world peace will inevitably originate from this." He also said: "The Greater East Asia War is a war of co-prosperity against colonialism... The passive aspect is to sweep away the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, and the active aspect is to establish Greater East Asian co-prosperity. In order to achieve this goal, the peoples of East Asia must be united in sincerity, mutual assistance and mutual benefit, from sharing hardships to seeking common prosperity, and from sharing death to seeking common life. The purpose of the Greater East Asia Conference is based on this, to fully display the Eastern spirit of righteousness, so that all of East Asia can be united as one to break the oppression and exploitation policies of Anglo-American colonialism, so that the people of all East Asian countries can enrich their independent and autonomous patriotism, and at the same time organize the necessity of coexistence and co-prosperity. All countries in East Asia should cooperate on this fundamental spirit, and then the Greater East Asia War will be won, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere will be completed.</p>
<p>It has been a year since the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was published. The war is still continuing, and the construction in destruction is of course constantly striving, but in terms of destruction, the intensity of the war has increased. Currently, we are facing the most urgent moment, which is also the final moment of the total decisive battle for the survival of the entire East Asian nation. Judging from the recent situation of the Anglo-American actively launching counter-offensive operations in the Pacific, the prelude to the final victory of the Greater East Asia War has clearly begun to be unveiled enthusiastically. Some superficial observers may think that this is just a war between Britain and the United States and Japan. The enemy has been adopting a "island hopping" strategy, in order to cut off the connection and encircle Japan, and use its so-called "fatigue bombing" and "carpet bombing" methods, vainly attempting to harass the rear and threaten Japan, and at the same time high-sounding its so-called "second East Asia front," using Chinese territory as its scorched earth warfare base, its purpose is only to attack Japan. In fact, the Anglo-American attempt to attack Japan is to dominate East Asia and enslave East Asia, which is to scorch China and sacrifice China. May I ask what we have today, besides Japan serving as the vanguard to defend East Asia, what else can resist the rampant of Anglo-American aggression? What exactly did we get from scorched earth and sacrifice? Originally, Japan's strength at sea, land, and air in the Pacific has been accelerating and strengthening in recent years, forming an unbreakable iron formation. The counter-offensive that the British and the United States have been promoting for more than two years has been delayed for a long time and has not dared to launch a major attack, which is a kind of worried hesitation. However, they saw that Japan's strength was strong, the overall awakening of the countries of Greater East Asia was awakened, their strongholds in East Asia were lost, and the poisonous schemes of instigation and discord also failed, and all the bases were shaking together, so they had to bet everything on a foolish move, not hesitating to work hard and try it at risk. They believe that Japan is the only strong enemy in East Asia. By defeating Japan, they can slaughter the entire East Asia, enslave the entire East Asian nation, and control the world of East Asia and do whatever they want. However, their adventure and their dreams will eventually fail and will eventually be reduced. We only need to look at the recent land and sea battles in mainland China, Taiwan, and the Philippines to see how poor the enemy is, and we can understand everything. After the fall of important locations in the battle on the mainland of China, almost all the enemy's important air bases were destroyed. In the air and sea battles in Taiwan and the Philippines, the enemy's fleet was almost defeated. This is the fact that gives the response to Anglo-American aggressors. In this situation, it is not difficult to imagine how anxious and impoverished the enemy's final struggle will be. After that, the intensity of the war will inevitably increase.</p>
<p>Firmly Believe in Victory</p>
<p>For the survival of East Asia, our efforts cannot be relaxed in the slightest. Today, we must exert the entire strength of Greater East Asia to strive for final victory. We deeply express our greatest respect and excitement for the ally Japan, who, up and down, are united, fighting hard, brave, resolute, and marching forward without hesitation. We sincerely believe that the ally Japan will be able to uphold the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and do its best to assist the countries of East Asia, so that they can automatically use their own strength, drop by drop, to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, we firmly believe that other friendly countries will also be able to firmly believe in victory, and jointly cooperate with the ally Japan to complete the war, and contribute to the Greater East Asia War with their own strength, without any omission, for their respective countries, for the entire East Asia, to strive for autonomy and independence. Finally, I hope that Chinese compatriots in the areas controlled and suppressed by Anglo-American aggression will no longer be deceived by Anglo-American aggression and be blinded by it. Let us rise up, realize comprehensive peace between China and Japan, let us rise up, strive for the liberation of the entire East Asia, and strive for China's independent autonomy. We want to survive and want independent autonomy. Apart from going to the enemy with all our strength, completing the Greater East Asia War, and crushing Anglo-American aggression, there is absolutely no other way.</p>
<p>We further believe that if the aggressors do not give up their ambition to re-invade one day, and do not stop their adventurous actions to re-invade one day, the angry tide of freedom and liberation of the East Asian nation will surely rise and surge day by day. Our will for freedom and liberation cannot be hindered by any force, and our determination to fight cannot be shaken by any trick.</p>
<p>Chinese compatriots! Japanese allies! Comrades of all East Asia! We, the tens of thousands of people in Greater East Asia, on this day can only abide by our common blood oath, face the light of victory ahead, exhaust our total strength, take the same steps, follow the open path of the common declaration, and advance bravely forward!</p>

<h3>Comparison of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Atlantic Charter</h3>
<p>— Li Quanshi</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The City News Association and other five groups held a commemorative speech meeting, inviting folk representatives from various countries to speak. The Chinese representative was Mr. Li Quanshi. Mr. Li's speech is moved and recorded here. —Editor's Note</p>
<p>It is truly an overestimation to have me, in my capacity, represent our people in expressing my feelings about the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. However, at the moment of the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War, I am delighted to be able to talk with you all on this commemorative day with profound meaning. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is the spiritual manifestation of the cooperative construction of the common prosperity sphere by the countries of East Asia, and also the manifestation of the assistance of our ally Japan to various countries. By comparing the essence of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration with the so-called Atlantic Charter of Britain and the United States, it can be clearly understood.</p>
<p>First, the Atlantic Charter was announced in August 1941. According to progressive principles, the Greater East Asia Declaration is naturally superior to the Atlantic Charter. This is in terms of time. The Greater East Asia Declaration is brighter than the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>Second, the founding countries of the Atlantic Charter are only two imperialist countries, Britain and the United States, while the founding countries of the Greater East Asia Declaration are seven East Asian countries. This is in terms of the number of countries. The Greater East Asia Declaration is brighter than the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>Third, although the Atlantic Charter is said to have eight principles, they are all fragmented. Although the Greater East Asia Declaration only has five programs, each one is very important. This is in terms of content. The Greater East Asia Declaration is brighter than the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Atlantic Charter guarantees the territorial integrity of small countries (such as Poland), but the current trend is that the southeastern half of Poland will probably not be guaranteed, so the spirit of the charter has been destroyed. The seven countries of the Greater East Asia Declaration jointly ensure the stability of East Asia, and mutually respect autonomy, independence, and the traditions of nations, which is the manifestation of East Asian morality. This is in terms of practicing the spirit of the declaration. The Greater East Asia Declaration is brighter than the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>Fifth, of the eight principles of the Atlantic Charter, there are two (namely the fourth and fifth) that pay attention to post-war international economic cooperation. Of the five programs of the Greater East Asia Declaration, there are also two programs (namely the fourth and fifth) that pay attention to post-war international economic cooperation. However, if Britain does not abandon its imperial preferential tariffs after the war, and the United States does not abandon its domestic extreme protection tariffs, then the so-called international economic cooperation is just a deception. This is in terms of the possibility of implementing the entire declaration in the future. The Greater East Asia Declaration is brighter than the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>Sixth, the sixth article of the Atlantic Charter declares that it is necessary to defeat Nazism, but it does not mention a word about racial equality. The first article of the Greater East Asia Declaration speaks of coexistence and co-prosperity, and the fifth article speaks of harmony among all nations and equality among all races. This is in terms of the spirit and meaning of the declaration. The Greater East Asia Declaration is greater than the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>By observing the above comparisons, we can know that the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the so-called Atlantic Charter of Britain and the United States cannot be mentioned in the same breath at all. On the occasion of commemorating the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration today, we should work harder to implement the spirit of the declaration, so as to realize the autonomy, independence, coexistence, and co-prosperity of the countries and nations of Greater East Asia as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Greater East Asia United as One, Jointly Build a New Order – Japanese Prime Minister Clarifies the True Meaning of this War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – On the 6th, the anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso delivered a radio speech to various parts of Greater East Asia at 7:30 PM, clarifying that from the perspective of Britain and the United States, this war is actually launched without a name, while in Japan, it is a war of self-preservation, self-defense, and liberation of Greater East Asia. Furthermore, it is a holy war with the ideal of re-establishing the world order, so the final victory should belong to Greater East Asia. The general idea is: ×××</p>
<p>Different War Aims</p>
<p>In this Great War, the Japanese Empire and the countries of East Asia, whose circumstances and positions are the same, have proclaimed their common war aims to the world, and a year has passed since then. At this time, the East Asian war situation has obviously entered the decisive stage. Today, Britain and the United States are developing their dreams of achieving world domination, and are permanently conquering and enslaving the Axis nations. They are further strengthening their colonial oppression and exploitation of the East Asian nations, and are driving their own troops to sacrifice themselves in the malaria-infested mountains and wild lands, or the vast ocean, and even inflicting sins on their own people that are intolerable in terms of humanity. This is the common war aim of the Japanese Empire and the countries of Greater East Asia, and the war aim of the enemy Britain and the United States is fundamentally different. The reason for this difference will be proved to the whole world. Not only that, the British and American people will also be aware of the harmful and unprofitable war actions of their own country, and even resist the rulers of their own country. Therefore, we believe that the decisive stage of the war situation will enter a new historical process, and the reason for this is due to the completely different war aims between us and the enemy, and the fact that the officials and people of the enemy country are about to stand in opposition to each other.</p>
<p>Declaration Principles Must Be Realized</p>
<p>What the Japanese Empire sincerely hopes for is to eliminate political autocracy and economic monopoly in the world, and then to mutually understand the intentions of each nation, respect the sovereignty of each country, and thereby realize mutually beneficial international relations. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is a manifestation of the specific principles of East Asia, and after the countries of East Asia have driven out the British and American military forces from their related regions, the countries of East Asia have been able to cooperate with the Japanese Empire to form an alliance and stand on the common front against Britain and the United States. This is because the countries of East Asia firmly believe that only by eliminating British and American oppression and aggression can they open up the path to their own freedom and liberation. After the countries of East Asia have broken away from the shackles of British and American military forces, they have now launched a new national struggle to resist the re-aggression of Britain and the United States in East Asia. This is a sacred war to firmly defend the already established national sovereignty and national independence. The war I fought was launched with the self-preservation and self-defense of the Japanese Empire as a starting point, and its essence can be extended to the broader purpose of the so-called common defense of all East Asian nations.</p>
<p>Unwavering Belief in Victory</p>
<p>The Japanese Empire need not be mentioned, that is, the countries of East Asia are not only fighting to defend their own independence and sovereignty, but also to re-mutual their independence and sovereignty. Therefore, the purpose of Japan and the countries of East Asia is also to form and maintain a strong common front to resist the common enemies, Britain and the United States. Therefore, the foundation of peace that the Japanese Empire intends to establish is not limited to the East Asian region, but also to restore the normal status of East Asia, which has been oppressed and subdued in the world in the past, so as to make this foundation the foundation of world peace. Therefore, if Britain and the United States are still obsessed with their war aims of enslaving the East Asian nations and annexing the countries of East Asia, the Japanese Empire will be determined to fight to the end. In other words, this is the unwavering belief held by the countries of East Asia, which share the same historical destiny as Japan. In this struggle for survival, we firmly believe that the countries of East Asia will surely achieve a glorious final victory.</p>
<h3>Chairman Bose of India Pays Respects at the Imperial Palace</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India, who is visiting Japan, paid respects at the Imperial Palace at 1:30 AM on the 6th to express his respect to the Japanese Imperial Family. He respectfully expressed his gratitude for Japan's righteous support, and then left in fear and trepidation.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Session: Highlights of Shigemitsu's Address: Utilizing Diplomacy Based on Fundamental National Policies</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Grand East Asia Joint Declaration Anniversary National Assembly, sponsored by the Greater Japan Political Association's Asia Development Headquarters, was held at the Hibiya Public Hall on the afternoon of the 6th. Attendees included Prime Minister Koiso and other ministers, ambassadors from various countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and Mr. Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, who is staying in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - At the National Assembly session, Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu's speech highlights were as follows: To conceal domestic contradictions and strengthen national defense, Britain and the United States sent large forces to lands far across the ocean to fulfill their ambitions and wage reckless wars. However, due to the bravery and skill of the Japanese army, they were dealt severe blows in the waters off Taiwan and the Philippines. Their valuable warships and countless lives have all been devoted to their Pacific war plans, with the intention of perpetually invading Asia and engaging in limitless exploitation, hoping to turn East Asia from a state of awakening to a dark struggle. They promised war to Chongqing, but in reality, they aimed to gradually erode China's military, political, and economic strength. They plotted to make East Asians suffer mutual destruction to achieve their savage desires. They violated justice, attempting to monopolize hegemony, permanently oppress the Axis powers, and forcibly make other countries follow their own organization, disregarding the interests of small countries. Therefore, our allied countries are cooperating with East Asia to shatter the enemy's ambitions and realize a just world, engaging in a holy war. The Grand East Asia Joint Declaration, concise and powerful, clearly demonstrates the cause of the Greater East Asia War, explains the fundamental meaning of establishing world peace, and expresses our determination. The Japanese Empire is formulating policies and utilizing diplomacy. Currently, various East Asian countries are striving to realize the spirit of this joint declaration. In the mainland, the State of Manchuria is first contributing its industrial equipment and abundant natural resources to East Asia. Key figures of the Republic of China, a cornerstone for the revitalization of Greater East Asia, are also assisting the chairman in leading 400 million people, awakening as East Asians, and standing on a common front with the allied countries, striving with a spirit of shared life and death. Only the Chongqing regime, driven and utilized by Britain and the United States, willingly serves as the enemy's tool and has recently been frequently scolded by Britain and the United States, which is truly a great spectacle of modern times. In Thailand, under the leadership of the newly appointed Prime Minister Apaiwong, the new cabinet has been well-organized and is cooperating with Japan at the forefront of the liberation of a new Asia. In Burma, under the guidance of State Representative Ba Maw, they are cooperating with the Japanese army in the vanguard of the liberation of Asia. As for the Philippines, despite the enemy's American invasion, they resolutely stand with Japan on the same front, cooperating with the Japanese army in decisive battles under the command of President Laurel, which is particularly noteworthy to the whole world. In addition, Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of India, as well as the gentlemen of the Provisional Government of India present at this conference today, are also leading many Indian National Army soldiers, fighting to achieve the great cause of liberating India. All of the above are cooperating with Japan to complete the war and advance the Asian structure for realizing the Grand East Asia Joint Declaration. Now the enemy Britain and the United States are building up their war power, launching an invasion from the two lines of East Asia. The war situation is intensifying day by day and is about to enter a decisive stage. East Asia has now reached a critical moment. Fortunately, the remarkable war results achieved by the Japanese army are gradually expanding, so the belief that the Greater East Asia camp will win is becoming stronger. We vow to defend our homeland and further contribute to the lasting peace of the world with the principle of justice, and we must not stop until we achieve the final victory of this operation. Here, we are determined to cooperate with our allied countries to achieve the final victory.</p>

<p>Xinjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - Zhang Jinghui, Prime Minister of Manchukuo, issued the following statement: The Grand East Asia Declaration is noble and far-reaching.

<h3>Kamikaze Squadrons and Submarines Sink Four Enemy Aircraft Carriers: Japanese General Headquarters Continues to Announce War Results East of the Philippines</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:30 p.m. on the 6th: (1) The Kamikaze Special Attack Squadrons attacked the enemy mobile units east of the Philippines on the 5th, sinking and destroying one enemy aircraft carrier each. (2) On November 5th, Japanese air units attacked the enemy mobile units east of the Philippines, destroying one enemy aircraft carrier. (3) On the night of November 3rd, Japanese submarines ambushed the enemy mobile units east of the Philippines, sinking one Albemarle-class aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>Manila, 6th (Central News Agency) - This time, the enemy Americans are fighting in the Philippines, finding themselves in a state of bewilderment, anxiety, and unease. Their aircraft carrier forces have suffered almost complete losses due to the weakening of the rear forward airbases and the defeat of the mobile unit forces in the waters off Taiwan. At the same time, they cannot secure the most important air supremacy. They are now planning to reinforce from New Guinea. According to an enemy commentator who used a radio station to explain the situation to the large city of Leyte, broadcasting on the 31st, "The fighting in the Philippines this time is fraught with difficulties for three reasons: (1) The Japanese forces in the Philippines are extremely strong. (2) The ferocity of the Japanese air force's counterattack was unexpected. (3) The Japanese strongholds are heavily fortified."</p>
<p>(Continued Fierce Fighting in the Philippines)</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The war situation on various fronts today is as follows: In the Philippines, the two armies continue to engage in fierce fighting day and night. The Japanese ground forces are fighting bravely, expanding their war results. At the same time, the Japanese air squadrons are responding and launching strong attacks on enemy airfields in Leyte Bay, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. When enemy planes attacked the Japanese base on the 4th, the Japanese air force immediately intercepted them, shooting down seven enemy P-38s and forcing them to flee. The Japanese air force also continued to attack Tacloban on the night of the 3rd, burning more than ten enemy planes. There was an explosion in one location in Tacloban, and an enemy ship was burned in Leyte Bay. In addition, on Peleliu Island, enemy troops have been landing, and the defending troops are continuing to fight fiercely, launching fierce attacks on a portion of the enemy troops who have invaded Observation Hill and the southern end of Mount Amiangal. The enemy troops have suffered extremely heavy damage. Currently, the enemy troops fear Japanese surprise attacks and have prepared earthbags and barbed wire to build strong defenses. On Angaur Island, they are also responding to Peleliu, engaging in fierce and bloody battles with the enemy troops day after day.</p>
<p>(Japanese Planes Bomb Tacloban Fiercely)</p>
<p>Manila, 6th (Central News Agency) - From the night of the 2nd to the morning of the 3rd, the Japanese air force raided the enemy airfield in Tacloban, destroying more than 100 enemy planes. They continued to attack on the 3rd, destroying three enemy facilities, one of which caught fire. The streets of Tacloban were also ablaze with light. Two military supply warehouses on the coast of Talac were burned. The Japanese side lost two planes in this battle. Another team of Japanese planes also attacked the Tacloban airfield fiercely that night, destroying ten enemy planes on the north side of the airfield, destroying one airfield, and destroying one ship on the sea, setting it on fire. One Japanese plane did not return in this battle.</p>
<p>Manila, 6th (Central News Agency) - Approximately 300 planes from enemy mobile units in the waters east of Luzon Island attacked Manila, Clark, Fields, Legaspi, and other places between 7:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. on the morning of the 5th.

After arriving in Japan, I immediately inquired after the Chairman, whose health is gradually recovering and will soon be completely healed. In addition, during my visit to Japan, I exchanged opinions with various parties in the allied country and had very pleasant conversations. What is most admirable about the allied country is the high morale and the abundance of material resources and war power. Therefore, the victory of the Greater East Asia War is within our grasp.</p>
<p>Travel Communication</p>
<h3>A Day Trip to Datuan</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>There are three routes from Nanhui City to Datuan Town: For land travel, in addition to taking trucks that run along the highway, one can take a shortcut and walk there. For water travel, one can hire a private boat outside the East Gate and go down the river. For the sake of time and economy, the reporter took a truck out of the South Gate at 1:30 p.m. on October 28th. The truck came from Zhoupu Town, and more than half of the passengers got off here, so the truck was not as crowded as when it came, but the highway was steeper than the previous section, so the degree of bumping was worse than before. From there, the truck drove straight east, then turned into the sea dyke and headed south. The houses on both sides were mostly thatched cottages, with fewer tile houses. Occasionally, one or two tall tile houses, like cranes standing among chickens, were built with fortifications, which were quite eye-catching. Upon inquiring with the fellow travelers, I learned that this was the residence of the local landlord, while the thatched cottages were the shelter of ordinary poor peasants and tenant farmers. These people were the villagers from Chongming, Qidong, and Yuyao mentioned in the reporter's first communication who had migrated to this place. The farmers in the fields, men and women mixed together, were quite busy, as it was the time to sow wheat. One characteristic of the women here is that they all have three thousand strands of hair behind their heads, and there are no women like those in the city who have their beautiful hair cut off. When the truck passed by, they did not pay attention and continued to farm as usual. Their leisurely attitude and simple clothes gave the impression that they did not know there was a Han Dynasty, let alone the Wei and Jin Dynasties. After about an hour, the truck arrived at Datuan Town.</p>
<p>(A Glimpse of the Market)</p>
<p>Datuan is the second largest town in Nanhui County, and its commercial situation is second only to Zhoupu. The market town is in the shape of a line, about four li long from north to south. Although the streets are narrow, they are cleaner than the county seat. The shops on both sides are lined up densely, and pedestrians are bustling. The business is mostly based on daily necessities. The local native cloth is known far and wide. The colors are diverse, the texture is firm, and it is well-known. It is woven by the women of the town themselves and is also a major sideline of the farmers. Its contribution to regulating the rural economy is significant. In addition, there is a native paper mill, whose products are sold in various villages. It is a pity that it is difficult to develop due to adherence to outdated methods and insufficient capital. Cotton is the main export commodity, and Xiang Sheng Cotton Firm is the leader among the cotton firms. The main sales area is Shanghai.</p>
<p>(Social Customs)</p>
<p>The social situation in Datuan and the status of men and women in society are quite different from other places. The women are strong, able to endure hardship, and work very hard. They are worthy of being heroines and strong producers in the countryside, unlike the women in general cities, who "eat their fill all day long and do nothing," specializing in applying powder and rouge to beautify themselves, and playing mahjong for eight rounds in their spare time, not engaging in production and willingly being parasites. The men are very idle, with the style of the Eight Banner children of old Beijing. Therefore, the teahouses and taverns here are always full, and business is very prosperous.</p>
<p>(Gambling and Smoking are Lively)</p>
<p>The prevalence of gambling in Datuan is the highest in the county. The size of the chips won and lost is truly shocking. The number in one game is not an exaggeration by the reporter, but tens of thousands of yuan is common and not surprising. Even the so-called new-style mahjong, which is popular in Shanghai, and various patterns were invented in Datuan Town. The reporter lived in the Daopai and talked to the shopkeeper about the local gambling trend. He learned that 19 out of 10 gamblers are farmers from various villages who use the money they get from selling the harvested crops in April and May as gambling capital and gamble heavily, not caring about the money that is easily earned with blood and sweat. Usually, the wins and losses are counted with chips. At the end of the game, the loser writes a check as proof of credit. Therefore, it is not uncommon for a farmer with only three to five acres of thin land to owe millions of yuan. When the time comes, they cannot pay the money, so they have to flee, causing their families to be ruined. These large-scale gambling dens are mostly located in deserted villages and move around every night. They also have special forces to support them, so although the county government has repeatedly issued strict prohibitions, it is not easy to eliminate them.</p>
<p>The prevalence of opium and morphine is rampant in the coastal villages here, and it is common for even women and children to be addicted. The harm caused by opium and heavy gambling to rural production and rural security should be taken seriously. I hope that the authorities can have the greatest determination to start cleaning up, so that we can talk about revitalizing the countryside and establishing security.</p>
<p>(Finance and Security)</p>
<p>There are only two banks in the local financial community, Qichang and Pudong, with a capital of 3 million yuan each. The main business is discounting and remittances, and the scale is not large, so the contribution to the countryside is really minimal.</p>
<p>In terms of security, the town has a strong military force. In addition to friendly forces, there is also the Fourth Security Company and the police special team. The current district chief, Gu Ming, is the commander of the police special team. This person also serves as the principal of the county-run No. 1 Middle School, which can be called a military-educational integration policy.</p>
<p>(Educational Situation)</p>
<p>There are two junior high schools in Datuan Town. District Chief Gu Ming also serves as the principal of the No. 1 Middle School. Because he holds many positions and is very busy, he does not often stay at the school, but he is usually very enthusiastic about education. The teachers at the school receive better treatment than those at other public schools. In addition to public funds, he personally raises the amount needed for the school's expenses, so the teachers do not have to worry about their meals and can serve with peace of mind, achieving remarkable results. The other is the private Donghai Middle School, with a budget of 4 million, which comes from donations from gentry and merchants from the town who live in Shanghai. When the reporter visited, he saw that all the students at the school wore uniforms made of local cloth, which was quite spectacular. There are more than 100 students in the two schools. In the reporter's opinion, the two schools should be merged, which would save expenses and increase efficiency. There are a total of three elementary schools, Datuan, Disheng, and Donghai, with a total of more than 700 students. According to the reporter's inquiries, the density of schools here is lower than in other districts, which seems to be a shortcoming and needs to be developed. The next day, the reporter hired a small boat to return to the city (the truck only runs once at 7:00 a.m.), and the two places are only four li apart, but the boatman asked for 400 yuan. The reporter thought the price was too high and showed reluctance, but the boatman kept muttering, saying that 400 yuan could only buy four catties of rice, which was only enough for two people to eat for a day. Alas! If the price of goods is not suppressed, talking about stabilizing people's livelihoods is simply going against the grain. As it was getting late, I let it go. The boat was so small that it could barely accommodate a person. I was squeezed in and dared not move. I only heard the sound of the oars splashing water and looked up at the sky. The long sky was as clean as if it had been washed, and the reeds on both sides rustled in the wind, making me intoxicated by the embrace of nature. Because I had been running around all day, I was exhausted, and eventually fell asleep. When I woke up, I had already arrived outside the East Gate of Nancheng. I left the boat and went ashore, and it was already dark when I entered the city.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the 6th, marked the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The city fervently celebrated. Despite the overcast and rainy weather, the entire city's districts uniformly hoisted the national flags. At key street intersections, long banners of red cloth with characters were hung across the streets. The New Citizens Movement Branch, Youth Corps, and the Fourth Model Youth Brigade affixed colorful celebratory slogans throughout the city, creating a solemn atmosphere. The entire day was filled with uplifting excitement. At 1:30 PM, the Youth Corps' city headquarters and various district youth groups conducted a large parade in the Central District, Hongkou, Nanshi, West Shanghai, and Pudong districts, creating an invigorating and enthusiastic atmosphere. Mayor Chen of the City Government, Minister Usami of the Japanese Embassy, and the Consul General of Manchukuo jointly held a tea reception at the Hua Mao Hotel at 3:00 PM. At 5:00 PM, the News Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, the Chinese National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association, and the Citizens Welfare Association jointly held a celebratory speech and singing gathering at the Grand Theater.</p>
<p>Tea Party of China, Japan, and Manchukuo</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Government, the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, and the Manchukuo Consulate General in Shanghai jointly held a tea party of China, Japan, and Manchukuo at 3:30 PM at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund. Among the leaders of the three parties of China, Japan, and Manchukuo in Shanghai were Secretary-General Wu representing Mayor Chen, Minister Usami, the plenipotentiary envoy to Shanghai of the allied nation, and Ye Yaogong, the Consul-General of Manchukuo stationed in Shanghai. Guests included directors of various bureaus and chiefs of various sections under the City Government, as well as prominent figures from all walks of life in the city, including Chen Shao, Chen Bin Su, Xu Liqiu, and Chen Ri Ping. Guests from the allied nations included Naval Attaché Kondo Kaishige, Army Chief Kawamoto, Information Chief Matsudaira, and Vice Consul Fukuma, as well as Police Chief Shiho from the Consulate General, prominent figures Hibino and Kurimoto Inkyou, and heads of the Axis powers stationed in Shanghai: German Consul General Fischer, Italian Consul General Stefanini, Minister Butte of the Indian Independence League, and Philippine representative Wei Xian, numbering several hundred. Secretary-General Wu representing Mayor Chen, Minister Usami, and Consul General Ye Yaogong raised their glasses to mutually congratulate the alliance between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, and then raised their glasses to jointly toast all the guests. For a moment, the champagne overflowed with fragrance, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. The gathering dispersed joyfully amidst shouts of "Long live Greater East Asia."</p>
<h3>Minister Matsudaira Discusses: The Worsening Relationship Between Chongqing and the United States; The Attitude of Pro-American Faction is Worthy of Attention</h3>
<p>The situation between the allied nation, Japan, and the United States in Shanghai has reached an extreme point.</p>
<p>The office of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai held a regular meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Hua Mao Hotel. Information Chief Matsudaira made the following remarks regarding the dispute between Yu (Chongqing) Chiang (Kai-shek) and Stilwell: "On October 23, it was pointed out that public opinion in the United States was deeply dissatisfied with Yu, the situation was worsening, and Chongqing's poor politics were fiercely attacked. Moreover, Ambassador Gauss stationed in Yu made harsh demands, interfering in Yu's internal affairs. From this, it can be seen that the pressure from the United States on the Yu regime is increasing. On October 28, the White House announced Stilwell's recall. The next day, there were frequent reports of Ambassador Gauss's resignation. In this situation, the relationship between Yu and the United States has already</p>
<p>As for the reason for the recent upheaval in the United States, President Roosevelt himself claimed that the problem was actually a personal relationship between Chiang and Stilwell. However, British, American, and neutral newspapers and communications all paid extraordinary attention to it, believing that it was not just a personal problem but a serious political cause. In particular, according to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 31st, Stilwell initially made three demands to Chiang Kai-shek: (1) Appoint Stilwell as the supreme commander of the Yu joint forces and grant Stilwell the authority to allocate weapons. (2) Thoroughly reorganize the Yu military. (3) The Yu Nationalist Party and the Communist Party of China should coordinate and adjust their affairs in a unified manner. It is found that these demands were not intended to be put forward by Stilwell and Gauss themselves; the issue was what President Roosevelt insisted on. In other words, the United States wanted to further control Yu's military and government. The cause of this was the Japanese army's attacks on Henan, Hunan, and Guangxi, which aroused American dissatisfaction. They then sought to achieve a common ambition. Chiang Kai-shek therefore, regarding China's fate, and the entire collapse of his own independent and autonomous label, strongly refused. As a result, Gauss and Stilwell resigned. Yu is currently maintaining its original views temporarily to avoid being unfavorable. However, the stubborn United States is still attempting to achieve its goal by both hard and soft means. We must therefore pay close attention to the attitude of the pro-American factions, such as Kong Xiangxi, Soong Ziwen, Soong Ziliang, Soong Meiling, Wei, Ming Dong Zhaoguang, etc."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chinese and Japanese Cultural Circles Hold a Cordial Discussion</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, scholars from Waseda, Imperial, and Keio Universities in Japan stationed in Shanghai, along with figures from the business community, invited members of the Chinese press to the China Club for a cordial discussion between China and Japan. In addition to Captain Ta of the Reporting Unit of the Japanese Fleet in China, and Lin Houfu and Wang Bingnan, participants included Otani Yukiteki, Ruzawa Junsuke, Akutsu Masami, Sugizaki Toshio, Moriwake Iwao, Dosen Kichinosuke, Oya Toshitsugiro, and Nagai Isamu, totaling over fifty people, gathered in a grand hall.</p>
<p>First, Captain Kenada reported on yesterday's announcement from the Allied Forces Headquarters and elaborated on the following points: (1) The Allied forces suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, as evidenced by the recent decrease in enemy aircraft attacking the Philippines, proving that the Japanese Air Force is more active than in the past. (2) The Japanese people are all accumulating materials to turn them into war power, creating great war results. (3) The sacred special attack team members are actively training, etc. He then analyzed the reasons for Stilwell's recall to the United States, followed by a cordial discussion on various issues.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Issues New Two Hundred Yuan Notes</h3>

<h3>Central Market Abolishes Fixed Pricing; Price Evaluation Committee Resolves</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Price Evaluation Committee convened its twelfth committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th of this month in the conference room of the Municipal Economic Bureau. Committee members Yuan Chang, Feng You, Luo Nezhai, Sun Zhongli, Xu Tianshen, Dai Ailu, Liu Weijun, Pan Da, Chen Guoquan, Chen Binhe, and representatives, totaling more than ten people, attended. Representatives from the Central Market, Anzai Kaneji, Liu Juezhen, and Hui Ziren, also attended. The meeting began with a report by Chairman Xu Tianshen on the progress of suppressing and stabilizing prices, followed by a discussion. The important resolutions are summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding how the committee should establish close contact with the price evaluations of various controlled organizations, markets, and military-managed goods to unify the city's price management, a public proposal was made. It was resolved that each production management organization should assign a responsible person to contact the committee's secretary at any time.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the evaluated items of local produce and vegetables at the Central Market, all of which are fresh goods that cannot be stored for long and are prone to spoilage. In the past, the fourth meeting of the committee authorized the chairman to approve and announce them in advance and then submit them to the committee for ratification at each meeting. It has now been found that there are still items such as fish, meat, and eggs in the publicly set price list, which are all fresh goods and have the same properties. It is proposed to handle them in the same way as the previous case of the Central Market. A public resolution was requested, and it was resolved that the perishable items such as fish, meat, and eggs should be handled in accordance with the resolution of the fourth meeting.</p>
<p>(3) The Economic Bureau forwarded a letter from the Municipal Oil and Grain Control Committee stating that some of the oil and grain prices evaluated by the committee were set according to the rationed price, which was very different from the ordinary market price. Before the committee's approval, please suspend execution, etc. A reply was sent requesting them to quickly adjust and reply. However, it was found that there were many similar situations other than oil and grain. Should all relevant management organizations be requested to quickly approve reasonable prices so that they can be evaluated and announced? A public resolution was requested. It was resolved that all relevant competent authorities should adjust themselves and send them to the committee for evaluation and announcement.</p>
<p>(4) After the public prices evaluated and resolved at the eleventh meeting of the committee were announced, the prices of various commodities still remained at the original prices. However, on November 1, the Central Market published the prices of vegetables, local produce, and north-south goods in the newspaper, which did not comply with the resolution of the fourth meeting of the committee and caused misunderstandings among the people. How should the committee handle this? A public resolution was requested. It was resolved that in addition to the market itself publishing a retraction in the newspaper, subsequent evaluations must be approved by the committee or the chairman before they can be announced.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>On Tax Adjustment</h3>
<p>We are striving to reform municipal administration, improve the treatment of public officials, and increase administrative efficiency. Of course, without improving the treatment of public officials, any talk of increasing administrative efficiency or reforming municipal administration is empty talk. Improving treatment cannot be done out of thin air. The most important thing is to replenish funds. The Municipal Tax Consolidation Committee organized by the city government has already discussed the issue of tax consolidation several times, and it is said that it is gradually achieving results. We are willing to wait and see its achievements. Here, we would like to offer some opinions in advance:</p>
<p>(1) Levy tax on the admission tickets of Jai Alai and dog racing stadiums. Since the gambling venues in Nanshi were banned, the two foreign-style gambling activities of Jai Alai and dog racing should also be banned. However, due to tax revenue and its special purchase, it still exists. This is already adapting to the environment. However, it is harmless to only charge admission tickets and collect donations for the two venues. It is said that the French responsible person of the dog racing stadium opposed this, believing that it would reduce business. This is completely standing on the position of the interests of a small number of French people and ignoring the public interest of the Chinese government and people. Then, even if the government tolerates the facts for special agreements, we citizens have the power to jointly sanction. How can business be maintained if there are no customers entering the venue at all? Therefore, we want to arouse the vigilance of the French responsible persons of the dog racing stadium, not to value private interests too much, neglect the overall interests of the Chinese people, and cause regrets.</p>
<p>(2) Levy special entertainment tax, such as for mahjong games in hotels, brothels, clubs, etc., stipulating a certain tax for each game. All other luxury consumption should also be taxed appropriately, taking from the wealthy without hurting the manufacturers.</p>
<h3>Three-Defense Welfare Football Match: Joint Battle Between Hualian and Shanghai Police</h3>
<p>In order to enhance air defense facilities, the Shanghai Special Municipal Citizens Air Defense Authority has specially scheduled a charity football match to be held today at 4:00 PM at the Shanghai Sports Association (Racecourse) on Huangpo Road. Hualian will face off against the Shanghai Police. Tickets are priced at 200 yuan for the grandstand, and honorary seats inside the field are priced at 20,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, and 5,000 yuan in four tiers. Secretary-General Wu will be invited to perform the opening kickoff ceremony, and Du Zhengjian will present awards to show grandness. In addition, the organizers announced that if the weather is overcast today, viewers can call 38683 for the Shanghai Football Association and 37437 for the Shanghai Sports Association to inquire whether the event will be held as scheduled. It has been found that the Hualian team, which will participate today, is composed of the elite forces of the two major Chinese giants, formed into an army, which can be called sharp and solid. As for the Police, it is the incarnation of the First Police Team of the previous session. The strength of this session is also very fierce. When the two heroes meet, a fierce battle is inevitable.</p>

<h3>Five Organizations Held a Commemorative Speech Meeting Yesterday for the Greater East Asia Declaration; Representatives from China, Japan, Manchukuo, the Philippines, and India Gave Speeches</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 6th, was the first anniversary of the joint declaration by the countries of Greater East Asia. The city's Press Association, Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Industry and Commerce, Civic Welfare Association, and National Diplomacy Promotion Association, recognizing that over the past year, the strength of the East Asian nations has grown stronger through united cooperation, and that the Allied Japanese forces have displayed their divine might, continuously achieving major victories in various frontlines, and that the Greater East Asia War has entered a stage of certain victory, and that the East Asian nations should uphold the spirit of the joint declaration and make further efforts, specifically held a "Anniversary Commemorative Speech Meeting for the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration" at the Great Light Theater at 5 PM yesterday, to awaken citizens' understanding of the progressive organization of the Greater East Asia Declaration. The presidium consisted of Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Tatsuichiro Funatsu, Yoichi Osaka, Xu Liqiu, Chen Binsu, Jin Xiongbo, Huang Jingzhai, Yuan Shu, Takashi Moriyama, and Wu Yunyi Zhai, with Ren Yunpeng as the Director-General. Guests included Chief of the Army Information Department Idebuchi, Chief of the Fleet Information Department Matsushima, Captain Kameda, Chief of the Information Department of the Embassy Office Matsudaira, Vice Consul Fukuma, and Director of Propaganda Liang. Entertainment included songs of famous Chinese and Japanese songs by Tomiko Hattori, Shen Ping, and Gu Ying, which were highly praised. Over three thousand Chinese and Japanese guests attended, the atmosphere was enthusiastic, and unprecedented. The conference proceeded in an orderly manner under the direction of Director-General Ren Yunpeng. At the beginning of the conference, Lu Feng, the monthly director of the Press Association, delivered an introductory speech, followed by speeches by representatives from various countries. The speeches are recorded below:</p>
<p>Speech by Lu Feng: Everyone, last year today, the countries of Greater East Asia, based on the spirit of East Asian morality, issued the Greater East Asia Declaration. In this year, the countries of Greater East Asia have worked together to strive for victory. This is gratifying. Especially for the compatriots in Shanghai, who have suffered under the oppression of the British and Americans in the past, they have been unable to bear the suffering. Whether or not there will be countless more instances of Anglo-American aggression depends on whether we win the Pacific War. Therefore, it is even more necessary for the East Asian nations to put into practice the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. On this anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the Press Association and other organizations, in order to strengthen public understanding of the Greater East Asia Declaration, are holding this speech meeting as a celebration. We have specially invited representatives from various countries to speak, starting with Mr. Li, the representative from China. (The structure of the speech can be found in today's newspaper dispatch).</p>
<p>Speech by Representative Yasui Gengo</p>
<p>The first anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has just passed, and now we are celebrating the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Declaration. I am truly honored to have the opportunity to say a few words of celebration in front of everyone, and I am personally very pleased.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Forces Invaded East Asia. China and Japan, whether viewed from a historical perspective, a geographical perspective, an ethnic perspective, or a cultural perspective, have a close and inseparable relationship. This is something that everyone already knows very well. However, why have the Chinese and Japanese peoples been in conflict with each other in recent years, engaging in wars that shed blood? Thinking about it is truly regrettable! Not only is it regrettable, but from a broader perspective, it can also be said to be a tragedy of East Asia. Why did this tragedy of East Asia occur? There are many reasons, and it is truly impossible to explain them all in a few words. Some of the responsibility lies with the Japanese, and some of the responsibility lies with the Chinese. Those who wished to avoid this tragedy of East Asia and strive to improve the relationship between China and Japan, hoping to establish an ideal good neighborly and friendly relationship, were indeed few in number, but they existed in both China and Japan. For example, your country's Mr. Zhang Zhidong, Mr. Liu Kunyi, and Mr. Sun Wen were representative figures, and Mr. Arao Sei, Mr. Nezu Hajime, and Mr. Toyama Mitsuru, who passed away not long ago, were also their representatives on the Japanese side. However, although these great figures in China and Japan made efforts, the result was still failure, and the tragedy of East Asia occurred. What is the reason for this? What is the cause? In my opinion, although there were indeed great figures and pioneers among the wise men of both China and Japan at that time, there were no great statesmen in the court, that is, those working in the government, and the people had not fully understood the major trends of the world. However, this is still a very small cause in proportion, and the greater cause lies elsewhere. Ladies and gentlemen, what is it? You must know. That is the enormous power of Anglo-American aggression in East Asia. This point, I am sure, need not be elaborated upon in front of you today. Why? Because you already understand it very well. Do you know what the Opium War was all about? A great British politician once said, "No other war has exposed Britain's immorality more nakedly than the Opium War." The British themselves, who had committed the crime, also said that it was an extremely immoral war. Even if it were not Mr. Lin Zexu, anyone else would have been filled with righteous indignation. In short, Britain was engaging in aggression against China and East Asia in terms of politics and territory. Seeing this situation, Japan resolutely implemented the Meiji Restoration domestically, reorganizing national affairs, and externally, it cooperated with China, striving to protect East Asia and planning to eliminate the enemy Anglo-American forces. Why was this? Because China was the first to be invaded by the Anglo-Americans, and the next to be invaded would be Japan. Therefore, in July of the 4th year of Meiji, which is 1871, China and Japan signed a treaty of friendship and a trade agreement. This was a treaty concluded by China and Japan on a completely equal footing.</p>
<p>Conspiracy to Separate Sino-Japanese Cooperation At this time, Britain and the United States were extending their clutches towards China, engaging in aggression. Not only did they conclude unequal treaties and expand the power of their concessions, but they even planned to partition China. At the same time, in order to obstruct cooperation between Japan and China and prevent them from resisting, they cleverly implemented a policy of separating Japan and China. Unfortunately, their conspiracy succeeded, and the war between Japan and the Qing Dynasty was due to their trickery. As a result of this war, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed. In this treaty, the most humiliating clauses began to appear, and there were also unequal treaties between China and Japan. However, compared with the harsh unequal treaties concluded between Britain and the United States and the Qing Dynasty, it can be considered light. Since then, Anglo-American aggression against China has become increasingly severe, and Japan has had no choice but to confront Britain and the United States. Thus, in form, Japan also oppressed China in the same way as Britain and the United States. This is a truly regrettable thing! In this way, the relationship between China and Japan became increasingly worse, and with the addition of Anglo-American incitement, the tragedy of East Asia that exists today was brewed. In short, the mutual hostility between China and Japan can be said to be entirely the result of Anglo-American aggression in East Asia.</p>
<p>The Dawn of East Asia Has Finally Arrived But the dawn of East Asia has finally arrived. This is the opening of the Greater East Asia War. Ladies and gentlemen, in this Greater East Asia War, Japan has swept away the Anglo-American aggressive forces within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the same time, Japan has returned the concessions to China, abolished extraterritoriality, and recently concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance to replace the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty. At the same time, it has abandoned various attached documents. If Japan had other intentions, it would never have abandoned extraterritoriality and all its interests. This also proves Japan's moral spirit. On the one hand, the Pan-Asianism advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen has also largely been achieved. Cooperation between the two major nations of China and Japan is the most troublesome and opposed thing for Britain and the United States. Now, not only is the relationship between China and Japan already like this, but Japan has also recognized the independence of the Philippines and Burma, and is making every effort to assist Mr. Jiang Shila Baus, who is striving to liberate India, to form a provisional Indian government, and has allowed the East Indian Islands to become independent in the future. The Greater East Asia Declaration is being implemented in this way. What is the reason for this? Because the power of Britain and the United States has been eliminated.</p>
<p>The Foundation for Final Victory Has Been Laid However, Britain and the United States, who want to destroy this Greater East Asia peace construction, are now attacking with all their strength. However, ladies and gentlemen, Japan, together with China and the other allies of Greater East Asia and the allied state of Manchukuo, is working together to crush Britain and the United States, and the foundation for final victory has already been laid. No matter how strong Britain and the United States are, in order to achieve our ideals and to put into practice our belief in liberating East Asia, we must fight on. A war with ideals and beliefs will surely be won. Facts speak louder than words. Are not the great achievements in the sea battle east of Taiwan and the great achievements in the sea battles east of the Philippines and in the Leyte Gulf good evidence? On this first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Declaration, I join with you in celebrating this anniversary from the bottom of my heart, and I pray that the day when East Asia is liberated will come soon.</p>
<p>Speech by Representative Liu Gui from Manchukuo</p>
<p>The allied nation of Japan is leading the Greater East Asia War, which has already entered the decisive stage. The army, navy, and air force have all achieved brilliant results. Today, as we hold the first anniversary celebration of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, I am deeply honored to be able to participate in this grand ceremony and express my thoughts. In retrospect, the development of the mechanical revolution by the enemies of Britain and America has only been in the last 150 years of the world's five thousand years of history. In the past, among the nations of Greater East Asia, such as the Huns, Mongols, Turks, and Indians, there have also been historical facts of entering Europe. Therefore, it is by no means as arrogant and conceited as the Europeans and Americans believe that the white race is the leader of the world and can arbitrarily trample on the various parts of Greater East Asia, implementing their so-called responsibilities, drawings, unilateral transactions, or various inhumane and unequal aggressive means to treat us, the nations of Greater East Asia. The enemies of America and Britain even call it "protection" for us, to develop so-called "happiness" for us. Their so-called "protection" is actually to turn our lands of Greater East Asia into their colonies or to become their de facto colonies. The enemies of America and Britain trample on our lands of Greater East Asia, dare to insult us, the nations of Greater East Asia, with arrogant and shameless words. This is a deep shame and hatred for us. Therefore, the responsibility for the Greater East Asia Holy War should be borne by all the countries and nations of Greater East Asia, rising up together, fighting shoulder to shoulder, uniting with the allied Japanese Empire as one, adhering to the belief that we will surely win, sharing weal and woe, and striving for final victory. On behalf of the people of Manchukuo, I express our determination to be of one mind and one heart, and to diligently advance toward the completion of the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration.</p>
<p>Speech by Representative Wei Xian from the Philippines</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, one year ago today, the supreme leaders of the seven countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere concluded a solemn alliance, vowing to cooperate and collaborate permanently in order to establish a new order in East Asia. This new order is based on five major principles: coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, promotion of culture, development of economic prosperity, and contribution to world peace.</p>
<p>One year ago today, these free and independent nations, under the brave leadership of Japan, held a meeting with the sincerity of the people of Greater East Asia, eliminating the minor differences between each other and sweeping away the rights and wrongs that Western imperialists had manipulated in the past.</p>
<p>One year ago, we, these oppressed East Asian powers, awoke from our slumber and discovered a common soul. This soul, after hundreds of years of being divided and destroyed by the insatiable British and Americans, had almost completely disappeared.</p>
<p>One year ago today, hundreds of millions of Asians were liberated from the hands of Anglo-American financial groups. With unprecedented joy, they welcomed the historic Greater East Asia Declaration from Tokyo, Japan, and vowed to defend their sacred land with unwavering loyalty, preventing the encroachment of Anglo-American imperialism. When necessary, we will not hesitate to sacrifice our lives to prevent Japan's newly established bonds of kinship and understanding with us from being harmed.</p>
<p>The Deep Significance of the Joint Declaration The Joint Declaration is a proper expression of Japan's efforts to unite the nations of Asia for the Japanese people. For the Chinese people, it is a sweeping away of their former semi-colonial status. But for the Filipino people, the meaning is even deeper and more far-reaching. This is the true Great Charter, which finally freed the Philippines from slavery and returned it to the embrace of East Asia. The East is originally the land where we grew up. For four hundred years, the Filipino people have been constantly fighting for freedom, first against Spain and then against the United States. For centuries, the noble traditions of the Filipino people have been mercilessly trampled on by the United States. Culturally, they could not resist the invasion, and economically, the situation was even worse. Under the oppression of the American regime, the Philippine economy was completely in the hands of speculators on Wall Street in New York. The United States never thought of improving Philippine industry, because it feared that it would compete with American industry in the future. American money is the cross that strangles the independence of the Filipino people.</p>
<p>Freedom and Independence Have Now Been Realized But today, the Filipino people are breathing the heroic spirit of a new era, filled with fresh ideals, thinking that they are now an independent nation, able to control their own destiny and put into practice the sacred principles of the common goals of the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It is truly an honor. In the past, the Philippines had no freedom or independence. Now they have freedom and independence. In the past, the Philippines was completely in a passive position, and its culture was dominated by the American nation. Now it is piecing together its inherent and beautiful culture from broken pieces. In the past, it could not be economically independent. Now, although it is still weak, it can strive to rely on itself and cooperate with its Asian brothers to create its own destiny. Because the Filipino people deeply understand the doctrines contained in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the Philippine nation is working with its natural brotherly countries in harmony and cooperation. Therefore, this great document, which was issued a year ago, is being commemorated by all the people of East Asia today and will be regarded as the Bible. When we march toward Anglo-American imperialism, we will jointly draw lessons and inspiration from it. It must be closely integrated with the political education system of all East Asian youths. It must serve as the foundation for promoting culture, so that the various trends of thought prevalent among all the people of Asia can proceed in this correct direction, which is in line with our Filipino traditions. This important meaning must be promoted to industrial leaders as a tool for managing their enterprises. From the stage, on the stage, in the theater,</p>
<p>In schools, the meaning of the Greater East Asia Declaration must be advocated. If so, in a few years, the minds of Asians will be filled with a broad sense of patriotism, contributing to the construction of the welfare of the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Defend the Sacred Territory of the Motherland Now, when Japanese friends are waging war to drive the American invaders out of the Philippine coast, the Philippines is facing a rigorous test. The Philippine government, under the wise and capable leadership of President Laurel, is deeply respected and trusted by the people. The cooperation between the government and the people, for the sake of the nation's dignity and for the sake of the Co-Prosperity Sphere's claims, is determined to defend the sacred territory inherited from our ancestors. This land has been sprinkled with the blood of heroes and martyrs. We will have even more generations of martyrs, but not only for the claims of the Philippines itself, but also for the claims of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>

<h3>Commemorative Speech Meeting by Five Organizations (Continued from page 3)</h3>
<p>Now, the United States wants to return to the Philippines and trample on Philippine territory. The American army is attempting to reconquer the Philippines. A fierce war is unfolding in the Leyte area, but because the United States has no just cause, it will not achieve victory. For forty years, the United States could not give the Philippines independence. This time, they are using the excuse of liberating the Filipinos from Japanese rule to invade the Philippine coast again. If the American government and people are generous and give us independence, we will be their responsible representatives forever. On the other hand, the Japanese government gave the Philippines freedom and independence without waiting for us to apply and without any restrictions. The Filipino people are therefore extremely grateful. The leaders of the Philippines, harboring this sentiment, decided to sever all relations with the United States. The Filipino people are very willing to maintain friendly relations with Japan, China, India, Thailand, Malaysia, and other nations in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. But what I want to ask is, what achievements have we made in establishing close friendship, enjoying common prosperity, spreading the inherent culture of the East, or promoting freedom and education? If not, we should rededicate ourselves from today onwards to this common claim of the Asian nations. Do not be impulsive with your own feelings. We must help each other. We must die together and live together.</p>
<h3>Speech by Indian Representative Naheke Jiangte</h3>
<p>Today is the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. It is a true honor for me to be able to speak to you.</p>
<p>One year ago today, the news of the Joint Declaration from Tokyo, Japan, gave the countries of Greater East Asia the goal of striving for permanent prosperity and peace. This declaration was initiated by the former Prime Minister of Japan, General Tojo. General Tojo must have carefully considered the past and present development of the East Asian countries, and then speculated on the future destiny of the countries, and obtained this correct goal of striving.</p>
<p>The devastation of British imperialism India has been devastated by Britain for about two hundred years. Britain willfully plundered to fill its own pockets, diminished Indian culture, and promoted British-style so-called "civilization," even trying to erase India's great history. They made the Indian people poor, so they could get cheap workers to use. In order to maintain its superior position in the world, Britain issued military bonds, absorbing all of India's resources. As a result, India became a coolie nation, only earning money for its British master, and also becoming an employee and servant of the British Empire.</p>
<p>Burma has suffered great humiliation under British rule for the past sixty years. Its forests and mineral resources have flowed to the British market. The Burmese people, like the Indians, have become farmers in despair, making money for their British masters. It was thanks to our powerful ally Japan that Burma was fortunate enough to regain its right to survival.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Philippines, initially the Spaniards used the excuse of promoting Christianity, but in fact, they were engaged in looting. Later, the Americans came, claiming to be the saviors of the Philippines, driving away the Spaniards, and starting an even more blatant plunder of resources, invisibly strangling the lifeline of the Filipinos. Now the Filipinos have enjoyed complete freedom and independence, and are truly grateful for the goodwill and lofty sacrifice of the Japanese government.</p>
<p>The pain of the governed countries Other governed countries have also suffered the same pain. For example, China, the British knew that China's land was vast and difficult to swallow, so they were as ferocious as demons, wantonly destroying and poisoning, using force to import opium and implementing humiliating treaties to seek private gains, making China financially and politically enslaved. Later, the Americans appeared and colluded with the Central Nationalists to jointly exploit China's rich resources. Now the pests have been eliminated, and China, under the leadership of the National Government, is moving towards the path of recovery.</p>
<p>As for Japan, it is different from other countries. Japan has far-sighted plans, preventing the devil from spreading poison on its land, and has been very successful. Therefore, in the past hundred years, Japan has become a great power in the world, enjoying peace, prosperity, and harmony.</p>
<p>The countries of Greater East Asia have now ushered in a new era. After the expulsion of British and American forces, there is hope for peace and prosperity. Japan is in a leading position, restoring peace to those countries that were previously plundered.</p>
<p>One billion people have been liberated from now on Japan is not only concerned about the peace of Greater East Asia, but also its main goal is to truly establish world peace. Japan has reviewed the past and present misfortunes of the governed countries and has come to the conclusion that there must be a kind of unity and mutual cooperation between the countries of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Tens of millions of East Asian people have been bound in the past and have now been liberated from the shackles of the British and Americans. Now the war is spreading all over the world, which is truly unprecedented in history. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War is actually a war to liberate the entire Asian continent. Now the time is near. The East Asian national movement will surely achieve success with effort. The new order of East Asia and the new order of the world are one and the same. The deadly blows given to the enemy by the Japanese Imperial Army, and the meritorious deeds of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force are praised by all the nations of East Asia, and are also admired by the continents of the world.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say a few words for India. Indian patriots know that this is the best time to break away from British oppression. Greater East Asia is like a big family, and everyone in the family works together harmoniously. Therefore, all the countries of Greater East Asia must regard the same family as their focus. We must exchange ideas and opinions, maintain warm friendship with each other, and helping others is our respective duty.</p>
<h3>Donations to the Child Welfare Association; Enthusiastic Pledges from All Circles</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Child Welfare Association, in order to raise funds for the education and upbringing of orphans, has launched a fundraising campaign with a target of five million yuan. It convened a full committee meeting the day before yesterday, attended by over fifty people including Lin Kanghou, Wu Yun Zhai, Chen Binhe, Xiang Kangyuan, Luo Hongyi, and Wang Zhenchuan. Chairman Lin Kanghou delivered the opening speech. Standing Committee members Zhao Jinqing and Sun Ruihuang reported on the association's affairs and financial situation. Ding Boxiong then reported that the association has now set a fundraising target of five million yuan, which can only cover half a year's expenses based on current prices. However, based on the association's past fundraising performance, it is believed that this fundraising campaign will definitely raise ten million yuan for the full year's expenses. After Chen Binhe proposed that the committee members present should make pledges first, Luo Hongyi and Ding Boji immediately pledged five hundred thousand yuan each, Chen Binhe, Wang Zhenchuan, and Xiang Kangyuan pledged two hundred thousand yuan each, Lin Kanghou, Wu Yun Zhai, Fang Zijun, Le Fucheng, Ding Huikang, Zhang Xiangwen, Xiong Mao Yanwen, and Hao Mingsan pledged one hundred thousand yuan each, Chen Xunxun, Sun Wenhao, Fang Yunxian, and Huang Jingwan pledged fifty thousand yuan each, and Wu Shenzhi and Xie Youting pledged twenty thousand yuan each. It can be seen that all circles are deeply concerned about children, and their sincerity is deeply admired.</p>
