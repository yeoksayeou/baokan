<h3>台灣東方　海軍大戰紀　日軍參謀作戰詳情</h3>
<p>某方面日軍基地二十日中央社電　日軍對圖犯西南羣島及台灣之敵機動部隊，自十月二十二日起的五日間，以猛攻擊及追擊於台灣</p>
<p>海面空戰</p>
<p>一役中，已將日軍航空部隊之威力顯示於內，並在此大規模之作戰，於敵新機動部隊敗退中而結束，以下爲從事空戰之日軍某參謀所談之作戰詳情：日軍索敵機，十二日上午三時即於台灣東方海面發現敵四羣機動部隊正在行動中，所待望之良機，終已到來，當即布置周密之攻擊計劃。斯時宮古島，皐垣島，奄美大島等西南羣島一帶，已發出空襲警報，作戰開始後，日軍基地頓呈緊張。十二日，機塲之出擊準備完全就緒，指揮官破例頒與訓示作壯行之辭，須能索敵機，守備</p>
<p>追擊敵機</p>
<p>動部隊，是時，索敵機已發現敵機動部隊四羣中之三羣，刻正盡力尋覩其中之一羣，接到攻擊部隊靠近敵方之電報，片刻我方對敵大型空母擊中之電報，繼而待望之捷報陸續飛來。十二日夜，無月黯黑，戰塲附近，因受季節風影響，陰雲垂布，視界不明，夜間攻擊條件實於日軍不利，日軍竟經克服一切於暗夜中海上追擊之困難，有某上士曾參加在馬來海面海戰時奇襲敵戰艦雷巴斯號之戰士，勇猛突擊，實進四次。上昇後即於白浪飛翻中見有巨物，此爲敵大型空母無疑，於是遂</p>
<p>放射魚雷</p>
<p>剎那間爆炸聲大作，繼而火柱上昇，濃烟衝天，魚雷已命中距艦三分之一之處，使之沉沒。又日軍某上尉機發見敵空母後，即發射魚雷，見獲效果後而避退，但被敵彈所中，機身吐出星火，但擊敵之目的已達，自身已無可惜，遂駕機向擊沉之敵空每衝出，如斯由於十二日夜間之勇猛攻擊，已獲轟沉擎沉敵空母四嫂，擊毀敵空母一艘，艦型不詳者十一艘之戰果。是夜日機亦有若干架未能飛還，迨十三日形勢有變化，據索敵機由十二日夜至十三日上午零時爲止所採知之詳情謂，敵</p>
<p>機動部隊</p>
<p>刻於台灣東方海面分成三羣乃至四羣行動中，敵艦隊十二日夜雖受相當打擊，然恃其數量復次後方派出巡洋艦，數艘商船改裝之空母，企圖奪回頹勢，斯日之攻擊，亦與前日相同，即實行集中轟炸敵空母。日軍接觸機與攻擊機，先後拍出我方認明敵影之電，堪料其作戰必定成功，長井海軍大尉之指揮機，首先突擊敵大型空母，投以互彈，勇猛衝去，而與敵空母同歸於盡，僚屬機亦繼指揮機之後，勇猛突進，斯日對敵大型空母投以巨彈，將之轟沉，</p>
<p>首建偉功</p>
<p>海軍中尉機轉變航路，勇猛突進後，即於眼下淸楚發見敵大型空母，其速力的爲二十五海里，於是中尉開始降下，放出大型炸彈，命中敵艦飛行甲板之上，巨彈落於火藥庫附近，當即發生大爆炸，料想即沉沒。十四日之戰非常成功，轟沉擊沉敵空母三艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘，炸毀敵空母一艘，戰艦一艘，此外，更判明尚有七處被炸，十四日晨以四羣所編成之敵艦隊，因於十二·十三兩日蒙受致命打擊，故縮小兵力，改爲三羣，且此三羣之編成均不完整。日軍於十四日</p>
<p>開始襲擊</p>
<p>其中三羣，此時日陸軍雷擊機隊等亦均參加該作戰，於是陸海軍完全一體，大舉襲擊逃走之敵機動部隊，斯日陸海軍渾然一體，實行夜間攻擊，轟沉擊沉敵空母三艘，戰艦二艘，巡洋艦三艘，炸毀敵空母二艘，巡洋艦二艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘及艦型不詳者二艘，並有五處起火，日機雖有若干未飛返者，此等皆爲只拍出我等雷擊敵空母之電報而無音訊，</p>
<p>據偵察機</p>
<p>之報告，亦確認未飛返機之戰果實甚偉大，至此敵機動部隊由於此三日間之猛攻，已受潰滅打擊，在十五·十六雨日之要擊戰中完全遁逃。</p>
<h3>重慶發表　更迭四部長</h3>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據重慶電，重慶政權二十日發表，特任陳誠爲軍政部長，王世杰爲宣傳部長，又原任軍政部長何應欽，宣傳部長梁寒操，均予免職，又渝內政部長周鐘獄已被免職，由張屬生繼任。</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　美國駐重慶各通信機關，關於渝方改組事件，作種種觀測，其主要者如次：反軸心國壓迫渝方，要求其改組，今終於將軍政部長財政部長等調換，故渝方已作大讓步。關於新軍政部長調派陳誠充任，乃蔣介石爲採用近代方式，訓練補備軍隊與美軍共同工作之意義，何應欽之罷免，或係因其爲國共政治和解上之障碍者所致。何應欽在邊區地帶封鎖共黨，共產軍雖向日軍作遊擊戰，然渝軍仍以數師精銳之一部攻擊共產軍，因而招致非難。何應欽對美國式之戰略及訓練方式及有限之補備，作遲疑態度，不予接受，亦遭非難。渝方此次之改組雖在斯蒂威爾召還之後，然此係華盛頓方面企圖解決國共問題及要求渝方改組所致，事實極爲明顯。前上海市長俞鴻鈞，已代巷目下留美中之孔祥　就任財長，孔祥　離任後，宋家勢力亦將隨之技退。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>上下恊力澄淸吏治</h3>
<p>繼承汪主席的陳代主席已於二十日的國府　大紀念週上舉行就職典禮，懇致訓詞，發表今後政府施政方針，都很扼要，也都是人民所希望政府從述實現的，更是人民對於政府值得擁護的施策。我們　道陳代主席向來是「爲政下在多言」的實踐者，所以、這次的就職訓詞，更可保護必能貫澈實現。不過，實際工作的幹部人員。也佔相當重要地位。行政院副院長　佛海先生，與陳氏共事商久，必能以輔佐汪主席者努力輔弼陳代主席，完成陳代主席訓詞中的各點。按訓詞分爲五　，五點中最重要的是「決意澄淸吏治，實施　政治」一點。因爲今後全國政治，走上正軌，全面和平實現，以及國家復歸於統一等等，都以這點能否澈底做到爲歸趨。所以我們特別重視這點，而加以論述。</p>
<p>代主席在訓詞中第三點上說：「國民政府還都以後，時局屢更，初因中日事變尚未完全解決，繼因大東亞戰爭終於展開，政府瘁力於百年大計，遂不免忽於地方吏治，檢討以往，無可諱言，負各方面之責者，或以官吏生活困苦，略迹瞻徇，或以僚屬過去勛勞，原情滅罪，循至吏治日壞，政務不修，吾人須知和平救國爲國人之天職，無功足言，信賞必罰，爲立國之大綱，不明則忘，現在人民痛苦深矣，匪共滋擾，荊棘載途，益以貪污，國將不國，自今以後，國民政府決意澄淸吏治，以副汪主席昭示廉潔政治之初衷，倘有茶毒人民，叨害國本者，無論何人，當認爲民賊，與衆共棄之。」</p>
<p>從這段訓詞中，我們可以明確的理解政府將堅決而嚴正的肅正國家綱紀，淸除一切假公濟私的犯法行爲，振作紀律，使我國政治，由「人情」的轉變爲「法治」的政治，全文的重心，就在這裏。然而，如何使「倘有茶毒人民，叨害國本者，無論何人，當認爲民賊，與衆共棄之」能見諸於事實，就必須有嚴明的賞罰制度，像韓非子所說：「法不阿貴，繩不撓曲，法之所加，智者弗能辭，勇者弗敢爭。刑不避大巨，賞善不遺匹夫。故矯上之失，詰下之邪，治亂決繆，絀羨齊非，一民之軌，莫如法。」我們目前需要這種法，同時又需要肯公正不阿執行法的人，維持法的神聖性。從今以後，希望每個從政者，不問職位大小高卑，厲行自肅，奉公守法，勿再觸犯法紀。但是，應要求政府目先能改善公務員待遇，便無後顧之憂，而能安於職守，這是必要的。</p>
<p>在積極方面的辦法，再重複我們過去一貫主張，革新政治，建立專家政治，所以，對於今後政府一切設施，務須適合這原則。第一，大公無私，放棄黨派觀念，因事擇人，務必才識相稱。第二，識拔在野公正廉明之士，進入重要行政機構中，倡導廉潔風氣。第三，設立全國性的民意機關，使人民有過問政治的機會，則可由於人民的監督與協力，「叨害國本者」，始能眞正得到「與衆共棄之」的懲罰，貪污之風才能撲滅，而政治始有躋上修明之道。</p>
<h3>昨襲九州敵機　墜毀廿五架　日海軍坂本中尉建功</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日大本營二十一日下午五時發表：本月二十一日下午三時，自中國方面有敵美B29型機七八十架來襲九州西部，自雲中盲目擲彈後即行遁去，經判明戰果如次：擊歴敵機十四架，擊損敵機十一架，此次空戰最有勳勞者，乃海軍中尉坂本幹彥氏。</p>

<h3>抑平物價與管理物資</h3>
<p>— 夢騶</p>
<p>物價問題，演變至今日，已經形成愈抑愈不平，愈管愈無理的現象了。同時，它已經不是單純經濟的問題，而包含政治，社會等等問題。更可以說，它足以使政治腐敗，社會混亂，治安不靖，甚至人心奸詐，道德淪亡。其嚴重性實不容忽視。時人對此問題，固已反覆申論，不厭求詳，仍未能使臺實好轉。茲由讚者夢騶君投到本文，其論點與一般容有不同，而側重於現實環境，極有研討價值，爰爲發表，尚祈讚者注意。——編者附言</p>
<p>中國和平區城內，原是固守低物價政策，數年以來，因種種窒礙，已經知道中國國情與日本不局，這種政策是不適用於中國了，但對於物價，此後應該採用何種政策，始終不曾有人談及，只聽見人民對於物價暴漲，發出嘆息之聲，全國上下，一籌莫展，爲民生計，眞正是萬分可悲。在此戰爭期內，因軍需緊急，物資缺乏，以致物價暴漲，固應設法抑平，但低物價政策，倘非國內治安良好，人好習慣守法，加以政府堅强有力，可以支出鉅款從中貼補，實在是不易辦到的。蓋物資缺乏，自然供不應求，而况現在人心浮動，那有物價不暴漲之理，要想抑平物價，必先管理物資。如果採用低物價政策，僅僅抑低物價，明定物價經評定後，即限止增漲，非再經評定不得變更，那末在定價未變更之間，私人儲藏貨物，不但無利可圖，且須賠貼利息保管费消耗等，自然無人甘願儲藏，而政府或統制機構又無巨大財力將全部貨物收買儲藏，勢必無從應付。所以，我主張中國應該採用物價漸漲政策以代替低物價政策。</p>
<p>現行有效之戰時物價管理暫行條例，就是根據低物價政策制定的。該條例規定應先評定民生日用必需品之價格，評價標準除該物資之成本運費事務費及捐稅等外，批發價格至多增加百分之十的利潤，零售價格至多增加百分之二十的利潤。如因成本及其他費用關係，有變更價格之必要者，得由物價評議委員會隨時酌核變更，倘不遵照評定價格買賣，即應處罰，凡此規定，均屬低物價政策的適用，而實則黑市價格在一年以來，增漲幾達十倍，與評定價格距離甚遠，評定價格早已成爲有名無實了。</p>
<p>或謂民生日用必需品經評價會評定價格後，如果有變更的必要，儘可隨時變更，並非一成不變。殊不知目前物價照自然的趨勢，必須逐月上漲，就是隨時評價，也是跟不上的。而况致府及統制機構的力量又不能賠貼巨款，收買儲藏全部物資，以固定物價，　與其逐月評價，造成貪官與奸商勾結圖利的機會，何如採用物價漸漲政策，參酌當時的正常市價及市拆利率，並各種物資的保管費自然消耗等，分前規定某種物資的基價，及每月漲價的百分率，容許其逐月漲價，如有特別情形必須變更其基價及漲價的百分率時，始開會評定。如此則旣可免逐月評價之煩，又足補救物價暴漲之弊。</p>
<p>或者又謂每月漲價的百分率，實際上頗難規定，如百分率規定過小，不足以抵補貨主利息保管費消耗等損失，如百分率規定過大，則無異政府公認物價的暴漲云云。殊不知每月漲價的百分率，首應參酌當時的市拆利率，大抵市拆利率比照當時囤貨利益的多少以決定其高低，如果政府能够嚴格取締囤貨，使利率隆低，即對於每月漲價就可以規定較小的百分率，使一般消費人受到實益。故爲民生計，先當嚴格取締囤貨，以壓低市拆利率。倘無法壓低市拆利率，那末每月漲價也就要規定與市拆利率相當的百分率，否則有錢人都願放款取息，就無人甘願儲藏貨物了。就照現在市拆月息甚高的情形而論，加算保管費消耗在內，假定每月漲價的百分率定爲百分之八，則全年所漲價格，也不過百分之二百，照平時的物價來說，固可認爲暴漲，但照最近一年內漲價十倍來說，就不能不算作已收到抑平物價的實效了。</p>
<p>抑平物價管理物資，首當勵行登記制度，以取締囤積。照現行有效之囤積主要商品治罪暫行條例來說，雖禁止業外人的　積圖利，及私相買賣，以暗示應即轉賣與業中人，但並未明定業中人之有收買義務及其收買之如何作價，致使業外的囤貨人，均懷疑慮，其懷刑守法者，大抵不得已而貶價求售致，受損失。其藐視法令者，或託庇外人，或行使賄賂以期避免檢查，而依然私行囤積，甚至利用機會廉價收買，反可獲得暴利了。所以，自該條例公布以來，迄未能收取締業外人囤積之實效。又該條例僅規定業中人違反命令及業規，匿不登記存貨者，應行處罰，而關於存貨登記後，如何保存，如何出賣，如何作價，如何配給，均無明確規定，致使守法的業中人，也都惶惑不安，旣疑將遭抑價收買的損失，又怕重受延不付價的暗虧，自然徘徊瞻顧，不敢登記。而狡獪者縱使在登記以後，也儘可虛偽轉讓，或設法隱匿，而仍事囤積居奇。所以始終不能達成抑平物價管理物資之目的。我以爲政府制定法規，應該使守法者不受損失。同時，對於犯法者嚴行處罰。所以制定登記存貨的法規，應該分別農產品及製造品兩類，規定某類內各種物資的收穫上市，當時或製造旺盛，當時的基價（應依當時的正常市價酌核決定）。及嗣後逐月　價的百分率，然後存貨人可有不受推失的保障。自然不懷疑懼，踴躍登記了。同時，又應規定存貨登記後，由一般囤戶或製造商，出售與採辦商批發商，再由採辦商批發商出售與零售商的順序，並其一次或分批出售的數量時期，零售商的一般配給或平價零售辦法，及各種罰則，倘能認眞執行，使登記後的存貨，無人敢於取巧舞弊，絕對不再有囤積居奇的情事，那末抑平物價管理物資的目的，就可以造成。乃現在各機關所公布的存貨登記辦法，都是僅僅規定登記的程序及罰則，雖附帶聲明絕不抑價收買，而究未定明登記後的管理辦法，以致一般人仍懷疑懼，照此情形恐怕登記決不踴躍，而難收實效罷？</p>
<p>以上是我所主張，取締囤積，管理物資，以達到抑平物價的拙見，自信尚非閉門造軍，一得之愚，尚希各方賢達有以敦正之，幸甚，幸甚。</p>

<h3>敵美機昨襲滬　被擊毀三架　盲目轟炸我方損害輕微</h3>
<p>昨日（二十一日一日）早晨八時，在華美空軍爲呼應侵襲日本本土，以求牽制及神經的效果起見，以相當機數之B29型機，向上海地區作波狀型之攻擊，經我方制空部隊之果敢反擊，敵機並無何等重大作爲，即告遁去。盟邦日本上海陸海軍報道部於下午二時發表如下：今日（二十一日）八時許，渝美空軍B29型數架，侵入上海方面，自高空投彈數處，毀民房若干，損害輕微。敵機經我制空部隊及地上部隊之砲擊，於下午二時許向西方遁走。</p>
<p>上海日陸海軍報道部於二十一日下午八時，逍加發表戰果：二十一日來滬侵襲之敵機，業經判明被我方擊毀三架。</p>
<p>陸海軍報道長談</p>
<p>日陸海軍報道部長昨發表談話如下：「近數日來駐渝敵美機，頗有妄動之勢，故我方時在警戒中，而今日敵機果又來襲滬矣。同日並有相常之機數，向日本本土襲擊，而敵方爲求牽制圖收神經的效果起見，故又襲滬。今日天氣非常晴朗，但地上有薄霧，視綫至爲不佳，故敵繼飛行極高，而作數度波狀形之侵入。經我方制空部隊及地上砲火之猛擊，敵機未能低飛，接近重要設施之上空，僅盲目擲彈而退散，結果，則重要軍事設施，並無何等損害，所受損害與死傷者，均爲中國民衆，實深堪激憤者也。查近來菲島雷伊泰灣方面之敵軍，作戰失利，而在中國大陸方面，又桂林柳州相繼陷落，敵方據點盡失，故敵美又派納爾遜再度來華，對英美在中國大陸作戰之失敗，頗多非雖，致敵美機乃窮兇極惡，輕舉妄動，盲目　作，目的顯欲掩避其戰敗之醜態耳。」</p>
<p>市民防空本部吿示</p>
<p>今日（二十一日）上午八時左右，美國駐渝空軍飛機數架來滬空製，盲目轟炸，至目前止損害極爲輕微，軍事設施，絲毫未損。惟今後諒必繼續來襲，敵人在太平洋戰綫處處失敗，乃以擾亂我方民心爲唯一之戰略，其目標在空襲日本本土，及以小隊飛機在大陸各地轟炸。本市市民不担任防空工作者，務須特別注意敏捷趨避。</p>
<p>敵機襲滬電綫受損</p>
<p>二十一日在華美空軍向上海地區盲目轟炸之結果，而使電綫受損，故上海之一部份地區，乃告斷電，而經電力公司之努力修理，即將復明，本市當局望市民予以協力，蓋際此戰時下，任何市民原均更有節減電力之必要也。</p>
<h3>改善電話服務　用戶須當協力　條原氏談一般用戶錯誤</h3>
<p>最近各方面對於改善電話服務，冀望甚股，今記者走訪上海電話總局　原氏，據稱局方當全力加以注意，尚望用戶，亦予協力，發表談話如下：</p>
<p>設備有限</p>
<p>近聞電話不易打通，如表軌聲久候無着等云，原因何在，第一因電話局內機械設備有限，有時用者過多，致應接不暇，蓋最近物價變動甚激，尤以各大小商行使用更繁，若問電話局增加設備，豈非善哉，但於決戰下之今日，關於電話等通信器材，不如我人想像之易於入手，局方當平均爲用戶供給服務，使局內機械得以平均運用。又須預防機械發生損壞等情，故當付以最大努力，如在使用者突然激增時，機械如噴火，然操作尚不及應接（事實上常有噴火等情）。</p>
<p>用戶疏忽</p>
<p>電話不易打通的第二個原因，也有不少出之用戶自身者，總之使用方法不澈底或不注意，不僅電話無法接通，且無故消耗局內設備，通話狀能自更惡化，此種情形常占百分之十。上海之電話所以不便，在一個都市內，分却〇二與舊租界等兩棧，此兩綫之使用法各異，故熟稔此中情形，乃各用戶最所必須者。</p>
<p>〇二電話</p>
<p>（一）關於〇二電話，打〇二電話時，若對方也同樣是〇二，則單撥號碼便得，但也有人多撥〇二，再撥對方號碼，例如撥〇二·一二三四五，則接至舊租界之二一二三四號矣。（二）關於舊租界之電話，凡雙方都係舊租界電話，則僅撥號碼便得，惟打〇二電話時，應先撥〇二，待得接綫員呼聲後，報告欲打之號碼，以上兩點，並無多大問題，是用户所盡知。</p>
<p>兩點錯誤</p>
<p>使用〇二電話時，有兩點頗易引起極大錯誤，是用戶必須牢記者，第一在取起聽簡後，並不是立刻能聽到表軌聲，時有待三分鐘或五分鐘而不得表軌聲者，但〇二電話並無此項情形，因接綫機動作與〇二根本不同，關於動作說明，事關專門，暫加省略，若遇此種塲合，因不聞表軌聲而掛斷再打，則仍再須待三分至五分鐘，又因表軌聲久待不得，而將聽筒取起離機，則其間表軌聲已過，即表軌聲僅三十秒問，若於其間使用者不轉撥號碼，則機械方面以爲各用戶已不須使用，即自動解去接錢準備，故於取起聽筒後，須時置耳畔候之。第二是號盤轉撥後，有時旣無振鈴聲，又無佔綫聲，此乃表示電話局內之機械客滿無空隙之處，正待空隙處接上，故請不必焦燥，應靜待之。</p>
<p>聽筒離架</p>
<p>（三）對方使用中應稍待後再打。（四）號盤於回轉時禁用指力以增其速度。（五）除使用時外，不應將總筒離聽簡架。但聽筒移離機外，不在少數，聽筒離架時，電話局內即有燈生光，離架過久，由局員分別加以警告，此等專司忠告之局員，目前自朝至晚，僅及九名，終因離架者過多，不及忠告。聽簡移離機外，大槪有兩種，一係電話使用中，一係使用完畢後，雖非出於故意，但多由於忽略所致，以上所稱之移離聽筒架，單獨電話用戶尚少此種情形，最多實係設有接綫機之用戶，因專接綫機之接綫員，爲早獲表軌聲，往往以數棧同時揷上，或於用畢後，仍不拔出，一窺局方小燈之明熄即知。設有接綫機者大部是官應·公司·大商店等，電話之使用次數也較普通用戶多出數倍，允於上午十時至下午三時辦公時間更爲繁忙，故設有接綫機者，其接綫員之良吾，實可左右一都市之電話服務成績。此外尚有人欲避免外來電話，故意將聽筒移離機外，尤實可惡。</p>
<p>人工接綫</p>
<p>（六）光應辯明對方號碼，然後再打。（七）不以手觸動聽筒架，聽筒取起後，除須重打外，不應以手觸動聽筒架。又人工接棧（上海有二萬架）之電話，與裝設接綫機之分機相同，凡取起聽筒，即有接棧員來應，在談話時不應以手敲聽筒架，因急促敲動聽筒架後，接錢員以爲使用已畢，於是雖在談話中，亦有中斷等情。（八）使用電話須有公德心。以上所述，雖非每人每日所犯，但根據局方之統計，此項不良用戶每日無慮數萬，機械因此蒙受影轎，表軌聲時時不發，或佔綫聲增多，影響全體通信，殊堪憂慮。</p>
<p>存道德心</p>
<p>上海今有數萬具電話，全部均使用電話局內機械，每日所接次數達一百數十萬次之多，若用戶來觀，白天的接綫情形，定能驚其壯觀，對如此廣大之公共通訊機關，用戶在使用電話時，應存道德心，如外來電話，雖鈐聲大作而無人出應，或如至遠處呼人來聽，皆應力加避免，可能範圍內務使講話簡單，允宜省去不必要之濫打電話，希望用戶盡力消滅以上所述之各種缺點，以求上海全體之電話，義於圓滑。</p>

<h3>盲目投彈</h3>
<p>最近敵美駐渝空軍不時來滬空襲，昨日復有敵機自晨間侵入直至午後始去。誠如陸海軍報道部長談話，敵機襲滬，不過企圖獲致神經戰的效果。盲目投彈的結果，軍事設施，並無何等損害，而所受損害與死傷者，均爲中國民衆。</p>

<h3>Eight Enemy Warships Sunk East of the Philippines' Omiya Island: Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces Air Force Battle Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on November 21st: Our air force, on the evening of November 19th, fiercely attacked enemy mobile units in the eastern sea off the Philippines, sinking two cruisers and destroying one aircraft carrier and one battleship. Eight of our aircraft failed to return after suicide attacks. Our air force also fiercely attacked an enemy transport convoy navigating the seas southeast of Omiya Island on the afternoon of November 20th, destroying four enemy transport ships (one of which was hit four times). A total of eight enemy warships have been destroyed in these attacks.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese air force units bombed enemy American landing forces and warships in the Leyte Gulf area.

<h3>Great Naval Battle East of Taiwan: Details of Japanese Military Staff's Operations</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Military Base, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese forces launched a fierce attack and pursuit against enemy mobile units intruding into the southwest islands and Taiwan, commencing on October 22nd and lasting for five days.</p>
<p>Aerial Battle Over the Taiwan Sea</p>
<p>This battle showcased the power of the Japanese air force. This large-scale operation concluded with the defeat of the enemy's new mobile units. The following is a detailed account of the operation from a certain staff officer involved in the aerial battle: On the morning of the 12th, at 3:00 AM, Japanese reconnaissance aircraft discovered four enemy mobile units operating in the sea east of Taiwan. The long-awaited opportunity had finally arrived, and a meticulous attack plan was immediately formulated. At this time, air raid alerts were issued in the southwestern island areas, including Miyako Island, Sakishima Islands, and Amami Oshima. After the operation commenced, tension gripped the Japanese base. On the 12th, preparations for sorties from the airfield were fully completed. The commander, exceptionally, delivered a motivational address, emphasizing the need to locate enemy aircraft and defend against</p>
<p>Pursuing Enemy Aircraft and Mobile Units</p>
<p>At this time, reconnaissance aircraft had discovered three of the four enemy mobile units and were making every effort to locate the remaining unit. Upon receiving a telegram indicating that the attack force was approaching the enemy, a telegram reporting the successful hit on a large enemy aircraft carrier arrived shortly after. Subsequently, a continuous stream of awaited good news poured in. The night of the 12th was dark and moonless. The battlefield was shrouded in dark clouds due to seasonal winds, and visibility was poor. The conditions for a night attack were unfavorable to the Japanese. However, the Japanese overcame all difficulties and pursued the enemy at sea in the dark. A certain sergeant, who had participated in the surprise attack on the enemy battleship Repulse during the naval battle in the Malay Sea, launched a courageous assault, advancing four times. After ascending, a large object was spotted amidst the white waves. This was undoubtedly a large enemy aircraft carrier. Thereupon, it was</p>
<p>Launched a Torpedo</p>
<p>In an instant, a massive explosion erupted, followed by a rising column of fire and thick smoke. The torpedo had struck one-third of the way down the ship, causing it to sink. Furthermore, a certain Japanese captain discovered an enemy aircraft carrier, launched a torpedo, observed the effect, and retreated. However, his aircraft was hit by enemy fire, emitting sparks. But the objective of striking the enemy had been achieved, and there was nothing to regret. The captain then piloted his aircraft towards the sinking enemy carrier, as a result of this brave attack on the night of the 12th, four enemy aircraft carriers were sunk, one enemy aircraft carrier was destroyed, and eleven ships of unknown type were destroyed. Several Japanese aircraft failed to return that night. By the 13th, the situation had changed. According to detailed information gathered by reconnaissance aircraft from the night of the 12th to 00:00 AM on the 13th, the enemy</p>
<p>Mobile Units</p>
<p>Were operating in three to four groups in the sea east of Taiwan. Although the enemy fleet had suffered considerable damage on the night of the 12th, they relied on their numbers and sent reinforcements, including several cruisers and aircraft carriers converted from merchant ships, in an attempt to regain their lost ground. The attack on this day, like the previous day, focused on concentrated bombing of enemy aircraft carriers. Japanese contact aircraft and attack aircraft successively transmitted telegrams confirming the enemy's presence, indicating that the operation was bound to succeed. Lieutenant Commander Nagai's command aircraft spearheaded the attack on a large enemy aircraft carrier, launching bombs and charging bravely, ultimately perishing along with the enemy aircraft carrier. The aircraft under his command also followed the commander's lead and advanced bravely. On this day, large bombs were dropped on a large enemy aircraft carrier, sinking it and</p>
<p>Establishing Great Merit</p>
<p>A navy lieutenant's aircraft changed course and bravely advanced, clearly sighting a large enemy aircraft carrier with a speed of 25 knots. The lieutenant then began to descend and released a large bomb, hitting the enemy ship's flight deck. The bomb landed near the ammunition depot, causing a massive explosion, presumed to have resulted in its sinking. The battle on the 14th was highly successful, sinking three enemy aircraft carriers, one cruiser or destroyer, and destroying one enemy aircraft carrier and one battleship. Furthermore, it was determined that there were seven other locations that had been bombed. On the morning of the 14th, the enemy fleet, which had been composed of four groups, reduced its strength to three groups due to the fatal blows suffered on the 12th and 13th, and even the composition of these three groups was incomplete. Japanese forces on the 14th</p>
<p>Began Attacking</p>
<p>These three groups, at this time, the Japanese army's torpedo bomber squadrons also participated in the operation. The army and navy were fully integrated, launching a large-scale attack on the fleeing enemy mobile units. On this day, the army and navy were fully integrated, carrying out a night attack, sinking three enemy aircraft carriers, two battleships, and three cruisers, destroying two enemy aircraft carriers, two cruisers, one cruiser or destroyer, and two ships of unknown type, and five locations were set ablaze. Although several Japanese aircraft failed to return, these all sent telegrams reporting torpedo attacks on enemy aircraft carriers but then fell silent.</p>
<p>According to Reconnaissance Aircraft</p>
<p>Reports, it was also confirmed that the battle results of the aircraft that did not return were indeed great. By this point, the enemy mobile units had suffered a devastating blow from these three days of intense attacks and completely fled during the interdiction battles of the 15th and 16th.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Announces Replacement of Four Ministers</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing regime announced on the 20th the special appointment of Chen Cheng as Minister of Military Affairs and Wang Shijie as Minister of Propaganda. The previous Minister of Military Affairs, He Yingqin, and Minister of Propaganda, Liang Han Cao, were both dismissed. Furthermore, Zhou Zhongyue, the Minister of Interior of Chongqing, has been dismissed and replaced by Zhang Shu-sheng.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) – American news agencies stationed in Chongqing are making various observations regarding the Chongqing reorganization incident. The main points are as follows: the Axis powers pressured Chongqing to reorganize, and now the Minister of Military Affairs and Minister of Finance have been replaced, indicating a major concession by Chongqing. The appointment of Chen Cheng as the new Minister of Military Affairs is seen as Chiang Kai-shek's adoption of modern methods to train reserve forces and work with the American military. The dismissal of He Yingqin may be due to his being an obstacle to political reconciliation between the Nationalists and Communists. He Yingqin blockaded the Communist Party in the border areas. Although the Communist army engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Japanese army, the Chongqing army still used a portion of its elite divisions to attack the Communist army, thereby inviting criticism. He Yingqin also hesitated to accept American-style strategies and training methods, as well as limited reserves, and was also criticized. Although this reorganization in Chongqing occurred after Stilwell's recall, it is clear that it was caused by Washington's attempt to resolve the Nationalist-Communist problem and demand Chongqing's reorganization. Former Mayor of Shanghai, Yu Hongjun, has replaced Kong Xiangxi, who is currently in the United States, as Minister of Finance. After Kong Xiangxi's departure, the Song family's influence will also decline.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Working Together to Purify Officialdom</h3>
<p>President Chen, who succeeded Chairman Wang, held an inauguration ceremony on the 20th's National Government Memorial Week, earnestly delivering a speech and announcing the government's future policy guidelines. These were all concise and what the people hope the government will implement, and they are also policies that are worthy of the people's support. We</p>
<p>Believe that President Chen has always been a practitioner of "achieving good governance through less talk." Therefore, this inaugural address will surely be thoroughly implemented. However, the cadres responsible for the actual work also occupy a very important position. Executive Yuan Vice President Zhou Fohai has worked with Chen for a long time and will surely strive to assist President Chen, just as he assisted Chairman Wang, in completing the points in President Chen's address. The address is divided into five points, and the most important of the five points is "determined to purify officialdom and implement a clean government." Because the future of national politics, the realization of overall peace, and the return of the country to unity all depend on whether this point can be thoroughly achieved. Therefore, we pay special attention to this point and discuss it further.</p>
<p>In the third point of the address, the Acting President said: "After the National Government returned to the capital, the situation changed repeatedly. Initially, it was because the Sino-Japanese War had not been completely resolved, and then the Greater East Asia War finally broke out. The government, exhausted in its efforts for long-term plans, inevitably neglected local officialdom. Looking back on the past, it cannot be denied that those responsible in various aspects either turned a blind eye and indulged others due to the difficult lives of officials or forgave crimes for the sake of past merits. This led to the deterioration of officialdom and the neglect of government affairs. We must understand that peace and national salvation are the duties of the people, and merit is not enough to be spoken of. Clear rewards and punishments are the fundamental principles of establishing a nation. If this is not understood, it will be forgotten. Now, the people's suffering is deep, with Communist disturbances and thorns along the way, coupled with corruption. The country will cease to be a country. From now on, the National Government is determined to purify officialdom to uphold Chairman Wang's original intention of demonstrating a clean government. Anyone who harms the people or damages the foundation of the country, no matter who they are, will be regarded as traitors and abandoned by all."</p>
<p>From this passage, we can clearly understand that the government will firmly and solemnly rectify the national code of conduct, eliminate all illegal acts of benefiting oneself at the expense of the public, and invigorate discipline, so that our country's politics will transform from "human sentiment" to "rule of law." The focus of the entire text is on this. However, in order to make "Anyone who harms the people or damages the foundation of the country, no matter who they are, will be regarded as traitors and abandoned by all" a reality, there must be a clear system of rewards and punishments, as Han Feizi said: "The law does not favor the noble, the rope does not bend. Those who are intelligent cannot refuse what the law applies to, and the brave dare not argue. Punishment does not spare the powerful, and rewards do not overlook the common man. Therefore, correcting the mistakes of superiors, questioning the evil of subordinates, resolving chaos and clarifying confusion, eliminating the excessive and aligning the incorrect, and unifying the people's path, nothing is better than the law." What we need now is this kind of law, and we also need people who are willing to execute the law impartially and uphold the sacredness of the law. From now on, we hope that every politician, regardless of their position, high or low, will practice self-discipline, abide by the law, and no longer violate the law. However, it is necessary to ask the government to improve the treatment of civil servants first, so that they have no worries about the future and can be secure in their positions. This is necessary.</p>
<p>In terms of proactive measures, we reiterate our consistent position of reforming politics and establishing expert governance. Therefore, all future government measures must be in accordance with this principle. First, be selfless and abandon factionalism, selecting people based on merit and ensuring that talent matches the task. Second, identify and recruit righteous and incorruptible individuals from outside the government to enter important administrative organs and promote a clean atmosphere. Third, establish a national people's representative body to give the people the opportunity to inquire about politics, so that through the supervision and cooperation of the people, "those who harm the foundation of the nation" can truly receive the punishment of being "abandoned by all," the wind of corruption can be extinguished, and politics can begin to embark on the path of improvement.</p>

<h3>Suppressing Prices and Managing Materials</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhou</p>
<p>The problem of prices, as it has evolved to this day, has already created a phenomenon where the more you try to suppress them, the more unstable they become, and the more you try to manage them, the more unreasonable it becomes. At the same time, it is no longer simply an economic problem, but involves political, social, and other issues. It can even be said that it is enough to corrupt politics, create social chaos, disturb public order, and even make people treacherous and undermine morality. Its seriousness should not be ignored. People of the time have repeatedly discussed this problem, seeking details tirelessly, but have still failed to improve the situation in a practical way. Now, Mr. Meng Zhou, a contributor, has submitted this article, whose arguments may differ from those of others in general, and which focuses on the real environment, making it extremely valuable for study. Therefore, we are publishing it, and we hope that the contributor will pay attention. ——Editor's Note</p>
<p>Within the Chinese-controlled area of the Shanghai Concession, a policy of maintaining low prices was originally adhered to. Over the past few years, due to various obstacles, it has become clear that China's national conditions differ from those of Japan, and this policy is not suitable for China. However, what kind of policy should be adopted for prices in the future has never been discussed. All that is heard is the sighing of the people about soaring prices. The whole country is at a loss. For the sake of the people's livelihood, it is truly extremely sad. During this wartime period, due to the urgency of military needs and the shortage of materials, prices have soared, and it is certainly necessary to find ways to suppress them. However, a low-price policy is difficult to implement unless domestic public order is good, people are accustomed to abiding by the law, and the government is strong and powerful enough to spend huge sums of money to subsidize it. After all, a shortage of materials naturally leads to supply falling short of demand, and given the current unrest, how can prices not skyrocket? To suppress prices, one must first manage materials. If a low-price policy is adopted, merely suppressing prices and stipulating that prices, once assessed, are limited from increasing unless reassessed, then during the period before the price is changed, private individuals who store goods will not only not be able to profit, but will also have to subsidize interest, storage fees, and wastage. Naturally, no one will be willing to store goods. And if the government or control agencies do not have the huge financial resources to buy up and store all the goods, they will inevitably be unable to cope. Therefore, I advocate that China should adopt a policy of gradually increasing prices to replace the low-price policy.</p>
<p>The current effective Wartime Price Management Provisional Regulations are based on a low-price policy. These regulations stipulate that the prices of daily necessities for the people's livelihood should be assessed first. The evaluation standard, in addition to the cost, freight, administrative expenses, and taxes of the materials, allows a maximum profit increase of 10% for wholesale prices and a maximum profit increase of 20% for retail prices. If it is necessary to change prices due to costs and other expenses, the Price Assessment Committee may adjust and change them at any time. If buying and selling do not comply with the assessed prices, penalties should be imposed. All these provisions are applicable to the low-price policy. In reality, however, black market prices have increased almost tenfold in the past year, far from the assessed prices, which have long become nominal.</p>
<p>Some say that after the Price Assessment Committee assesses the prices of daily necessities for the people's livelihood, changes can be made at any time if necessary, and they are not fixed. However, the current trend of prices is that they must rise month by month, and even if assessed at any time, it is still impossible to keep up. Moreover, the government and control agencies do not have the power to subsidize huge sums of money to buy up and store all materials to fix prices. Rather than assessing prices month by month, creating opportunities for corrupt officials and unscrupulous merchants to collude and profit, it would be better to adopt a policy of gradually increasing prices, taking into account the normal market prices and market discount rates at the time, as well as the storage fees and natural wastage of various materials. The base price of a certain material and the percentage of price increase per month should be stipulated in advance, allowing it to increase in price month by month. Only when there are special circumstances that require changing the base price and the percentage of price increase should a meeting be held for assessment. In this way, the trouble of monthly assessments can be avoided, and the drawbacks of soaring prices can be remedied.</p>
<p>Some may also say that the percentage of monthly price increases is actually quite difficult to stipulate. If the percentage is stipulated too small, it will not be enough to compensate for the losses of interest, storage fees, and wastage for the cargo owners. If the percentage is stipulated too large, it would be tantamount to the government publicly acknowledging the soaring of prices. However, the percentage of monthly price increases should first take into account the market discount rates at the time. Generally, the market discount rates are determined by the amount of profit from hoarding at that time. If the government can strictly crack down on hoarding and lower the interest rates, then a smaller percentage can be stipulated for the monthly price increase, so that general consumers can receive practical benefits. Therefore, for the sake of the people's livelihood, strict crackdown on hoarding should be done first to lower market discount rates. If it is impossible to lower market discount rates, then the monthly price increase should be stipulated at a percentage equivalent to the market discount rate. Otherwise, wealthy people would all be willing to lend money to earn interest, and no one would be willing to store goods. Even based on the current situation of very high monthly market interest rates, adding in storage fees and wastage, if we assume that the percentage of monthly price increase is set at 8%, then the price increase for the whole year would be no more than 200%. In terms of normal prices, it could certainly be considered a soaring price, but in terms of the tenfold price increase in the past year, it cannot but be considered that the practical effect of suppressing prices has been achieved.</p>
<p>To suppress prices and manage materials, the registration system should be vigorously implemented to crack down on hoarding. According to the current effective Provisional Regulations on Punishing the Crime of Hoarding Major Commodities, while it prohibits non-industry people from hoarding for profit and private buying and selling, implying that they should immediately resell to people in the industry, it does not explicitly stipulate the obligation of people in the industry to buy and how to price the purchase. This causes non-industry hoarders to be suspicious. Those who uphold the law are mostly forced to lower prices and sell, resulting in losses. Those who despise the law either seek shelter with foreigners or use bribes to avoid inspection, and still hoard privately, even taking the opportunity to buy cheaply and earn exorbitant profits. Therefore, since the promulgation of these regulations, it has not been able to achieve the practical effect of cracking down on hoarding by non-industry people. Moreover, the regulations only stipulate that people in the industry who violate orders and industry rules and conceal their inventory without registering it should be punished. However, there are no clear provisions on how to preserve, sell, price, and allocate the registered inventory, causing law-abiding people in the industry to be uneasy. They are both suspected of suffering losses from being bought at suppressed prices and afraid of suffering hidden losses from prolonged delays in payment. Naturally, they hesitate and dare not register. And cunning people, even after registering, can still make false transfers or find ways to conceal it, and still engage in hoarding for profit. Therefore, the purpose of suppressing prices and managing materials can never be achieved. I believe that the government should make laws and regulations that protect law-abiding people from losses. At the same time, it should severely punish those who violate the law. Therefore, the regulations for registering inventory should separately classify agricultural products and manufactured goods, stipulating the base price (which should be determined based on the normal market price at that time) at the time when various materials within a certain category are harvested and come onto the market, or when manufacturing is booming, and the percentage of price increase per month thereafter. Then, the inventory holder can have the guarantee of not suffering losses and will naturally not be suspicious and will actively register. At the same time, it should also stipulate the order in which the registered inventory is sold by general hoarders or manufacturers to purchasing agents and wholesalers, and then by purchasing agents and wholesalers to retailers, as well as the quantity and timing of the sale in one or multiple batches, the general allocation or low-priced retail methods of retailers, and various penalties. If these can be earnestly enforced, so that no one dares to take advantage of loopholes and commit fraud with the registered inventory, and there is absolutely no more hoarding for profit, then the purpose of suppressing prices and managing materials can be achieved. However, the inventory registration methods announced by various agencies now only stipulate the registration procedures and penalties. Although it is stated that there will be no price suppression and purchase, the management methods after registration are not clearly defined, causing people to still be suspicious. In this situation, I am afraid that registration will not be active and it will be difficult to achieve practical results.</p>
<p>The above is my humble opinion on cracking down on hoarding, managing materials, and achieving the suppression of prices. I am confident that it is not a foolish idea conceived in isolation. I hope that wise people from all sides can correct it. It would be fortunate, fortunate indeed.</p>

<h3>Enemy American Planes Attacked Shanghai Yesterday, Three Were Shot Down, Indiscriminate Bombing Caused Minor Damage to Our Side</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 21st), at 8 a.m., in order to respond to the attack on the Japanese mainland, with the aim of exerting restraint and creating a psychological effect, the US Air Force sent a considerable number of B-29 aircraft to attack the Shanghai area in waves. After a courageous counterattack by our air defense forces, the enemy aircraft did not achieve any significant results and fled. The Shanghai Naval Press Department of our ally, Japan, announced the following at 2 p.m.: Today (the 21st) at approximately 8 a.m., several B-29 aircraft of the Chongqing-American Air Force intruded into the Shanghai area and dropped bombs in several places from high altitude, destroying some civilian houses and causing minor damage. The enemy aircraft fled westward at approximately 2 p.m. after being shelled by our air defense forces and ground forces.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Naval Press Department of Japan further announced the battle results at 8 p.m. on the 21st: It has been determined that three of the enemy aircraft that attacked Shanghai on the 21st were shot down by our side.</p>
<p>Statement by the Head of the Naval Press Department</p>
<p>The Head of the Japanese Naval Press Department issued the following statement yesterday: "In recent days, the enemy American aircraft stationed in Chongqing have shown a tendency to act recklessly, so our side has been on alert. Today, the enemy aircraft indeed attacked Shanghai again. On the same day, a considerable number of aircraft also attacked the Japanese mainland. The enemy, in order to exert restraint and achieve a psychological effect, attacked Shanghai again. The weather today was very clear, but there was a thin fog on the ground, and visibility was very poor, so the enemy flew extremely high and intruded in several waves. After a fierce attack by our air defense forces and ground artillery fire, the enemy aircraft were unable to fly low and approach the airspace above important facilities, and only dropped bombs indiscriminately and scattered. As a result, important military facilities suffered no damage, and those who suffered damage and casualties were all Chinese civilians, which is deeply infuriating. It has been found that the enemy forces in the Leyte Gulf area of the Philippines have suffered operational setbacks, and in mainland China, Guilin and Liuzhou have fallen one after another, and the enemy's strongholds have been lost. Therefore, the enemy Americans have sent Nelson to China again, and there has been much criticism of the failure of the British and Americans to fight in mainland China, which has led the enemy American aircraft to become extremely vicious and act recklessly, bombing indiscriminately, with the obvious aim of concealing their defeat."</p>
<p>Notice from the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters</p>
<p>At approximately 8 a.m. today (the 21st), several aircraft of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing came to Shanghai to carry out air raids and indiscriminate bombing. So far, the damage has been extremely minor, and no military facilities have been damaged. However, it is expected that they will continue to attack in the future. The enemy is failing everywhere on the Pacific front and is using disturbing our people's morale as their only strategy. Their targets are to raid the Japanese mainland and bomb various places on the mainland with small teams of aircraft. Citizens of this city who are not responsible for air defense work must pay special attention to quick evacuation.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Attack Shanghai, Power Lines Damaged</p>
<p>As a result of the indiscriminate bombing of the Shanghai area by the US Air Force on the 21st, power lines were damaged, causing power outages in some parts of Shanghai. However, after the efforts of the power company to repair them, power will be restored soon. The municipal authorities hope that citizens will cooperate, as any citizen has an even greater need to conserve electricity during this wartime.</p>
<h3>Improving Telephone Service, Users Must Cooperate, Mr. Tiao Yuan Discusses Common User Mistakes</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been high hopes from all sides for improving telephone service. Today, a reporter visited Mr. Tiao Yuan of the Shanghai Telephone Administration. According to him, the Administration will do its best to pay attention to this matter and hopes that users will also cooperate. His statement is as follows:</p>
<p>Limited Equipment</p>
<p>Recently, it has been heard that it is not easy to get through on the phone, and that the dial tone is long in coming, etc. The reason for this is that the mechanical equipment inside the telephone exchange is limited. Sometimes there are too many users, causing it to be unable to cope. Recently, prices have changed drastically, especially for large and small businesses, which use the telephone even more frequently. If asked whether the telephone exchange should increase its equipment, it would be great, but in today's decisive battle, communication equipment such as telephones is not as easy to obtain as we imagine. The Administration will provide services to users on average, so that the equipment in the exchange can be used equally. It is also necessary to prevent mechanical damage, etc., so we must make the greatest effort. If the number of users suddenly increases sharply, the machine will seem to be spitting fire, and the operation will not be able to keep up (in fact, there are often situations where it spits fire).</p>
<p>User Neglect</p>
<p>The second reason why it is not easy to get through on the phone is that many users themselves are responsible. In short, if the method of use is not thorough or if users are not careful, not only will the phone not get through, but it will also consume the exchange's equipment for no reason, and the condition of the call will naturally worsen. This situation often accounts for 10%. The reason why telephones in Shanghai are inconvenient is that the city is divided into two sections, the 02 area and the Old Concession. The method of using these two lines is different, so familiarity with this situation is essential for all users.</p>
<p>02 Telephone</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the 02 telephone, when dialing an 02 telephone, if the other party is also an 02 telephone, then simply dialing the number will do. However, some people dial 02 and then dial the other party's number. For example, dialing 02.12345 will connect to No. 21234 of the Old Concession. (2) Regarding telephones in the Old Concession, if both parties are telephones in the Old Concession, then simply dialing the number will do. However, when dialing an 02 telephone, you should first dial 02, and after hearing the operator's voice, report the number you want to dial. The above two points are not a big problem, and users know them well.</p>
<p>Two Mistakes</p>
<p>When using the 02 telephone, there are two points that are quite easy to cause major mistakes, and users must remember them well. First, after picking up the receiver, you cannot immediately hear the dial tone. Sometimes you have to wait three or five minutes and still not hear the dial tone. However, the 02 telephone does not have this situation, because the operation of the switchboard is fundamentally different from 02. An explanation of the operation would involve technical details, so we will omit it for the time being. If you encounter this situation, if you hang up and dial again because you don't hear the dial tone, you will still have to wait three to five minutes. Also, because the dial tone takes a long time to come, if you take the receiver off the hook, the dial tone will have already passed. The dial tone only lasts for 30 seconds. If the user does not dial a number during that time, the machine will think that the user no longer needs to use it and will automatically disconnect the connection in preparation, so after picking up the receiver, you must put it next to your ear and wait. Second, after dialing the dial, sometimes there is neither a ringing tone nor a busy tone. This indicates that the machine in the telephone exchange is full and there is no space available, and it is waiting for an available space to connect. Therefore, please do not be anxious and wait quietly.</p>
<p>Receiver Off Hook</p>
<p>(3) If the other party is in use, wait a little longer and then dial again. (4) Do not use finger force to increase the speed of the dial when it is rotating back. (5) Except when in use, the receiver should not be removed from the hook. However, there are quite a few cases of the receiver being removed from the hook. When the receiver is off the hook, a light will light up in the telephone exchange. If the receiver is off the hook for too long, operators will warn separately. There are currently only nine operators who specialize in giving this advice from morning to night, and they are ultimately unable to advise because there are too many people leaving their receivers off the hook. There are generally two reasons for removing the receiver from the hook: one is during telephone use, and the other is after use. Although it is not intentional, it is mostly due to negligence. The above-mentioned removal of the receiver from the hook is less common among individual telephone users. It is most common among users with switchboards. In order to get a dial tone earlier, the switchboard operator often inserts several lines at the same time, or after use, they still do not unplug them. A glance at the small light of the Administration will reveal whether it is on or off. Most of those who have switchboards are government agencies, companies, and large stores, etc. The number of times they use the phone is several times higher than ordinary users, and it is even busier during office hours from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Therefore, the quality of the operator of those who have switchboards can affect the telephone service performance of an entire city. In addition, there are those who deliberately remove the receiver from the hook to avoid incoming calls, which is especially hateful.</p>
<p>Manual Connection</p>
<p>(6) Be sure to identify the other party's number before dialing. (7) Do not touch the receiver hook with your hand. After picking up the receiver, you should not touch the receiver hook with your hand unless you need to redial. Also, the telephone for manual connection (there are 20,000 in Shanghai) is the same as a branch with a switchboard. Whenever you pick up the receiver, an operator will respond. Do not knock on the receiver hook with your hand while talking, because after rapidly knocking on the receiver hook, the operator will think that you have finished using it, and there may be interruptions even while you are talking. (8) You must have public spirit when using the telephone. Although the above is not committed by everyone every day, according to the Administration's statistics, there are tens of thousands of these bad users every day. The machine suffers as a result, the dial tone does not come out from time to time, or the busy tone increases, affecting overall communication, which is extremely worrying.</p>
<p>Have a Moral Mind</p>
<p>Shanghai now has tens of thousands of telephones, all of which use the mechanical equipment inside the telephone exchange. The number of connections made every day reaches more than one million. If users come to see the connection situation during the day, they will definitely be amazed by its grandeur. For such a large public communication organization, users should have a moral mind when using the telephone. For example, incoming calls should be answered even if the bell is ringing loudly, and you should try to avoid calling someone from far away to listen. You should try to keep your conversation simple as much as possible and avoid unnecessary random calls. We hope that users will do their best to eliminate the various shortcomings mentioned above in order to make the telephone system in Shanghai operate smoothly.</p>
<h3>Celebration Meeting, Postponed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Association and the China Film Company jointly announced yesterday: The "Celebration Meeting for the Annihilation of American Forces in Chongqing Bases" originally scheduled by this Association, etc., to be held at the Grand Theater at 7 p.m. today (the 22nd) has been postponed due to insufficient preparation. All invitation cards and admission tickets issued will remain valid. Please keep them properly. Once the date of the event is decided, it will be announced in the newspaper. Please pay attention.</p>
<h3>Handling Seized Firearms and Items, Police Bureau Sets Measures, Orders Sub-bureaus to Send to General Bureau for Identification</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau's Judicial Department has stipulated measures for the prompt disposal of seized firearms, explosives, and related items and has ordered all sub-bureaus, especially the former Second Police Bureau and sub-bureaus and county police bureaus, to strictly comply with them in order to achieve uniformity. When firearms, explosives, and related items are seized, they should be sent to the Identification Section of the Judicial Department of the General Bureau as soon as possible for identification, so that they can be compared with the criminal record of the firearm and the identity of the perpetrator or owner can be known, which can serve as an important reference material for criminal investigation. Therefore, if each sub-bureau can recognize these situations and seize such items as evidence, they should be sent to the Identification Section to assist in criminal investigation. However, the former Second Police Bureau, its sub-bureaus, and the county police bureaus still follow established procedures. When encountering evidence items of this importance, do not delay and send them to the Identification Section of the Judicial Department of the General Bureau quickly for identification, so that they can be used as information for criminal investigation. At the same time, when an incident occurs, the following items should be collected and sent for identification: (1) For firearms and pistols used as murder weapons in riot activities, the firearms themselves must be collected, as well as the spent cartridges, bullets, and bullets removed from the body. (2) In the event of an explosive incident, even the smallest fragments after the explosion should be collected. (3) In the event of an unexploded incident, the Identification Section of the Judicial Department of the General Bureau should be contacted by telephone immediately and a request made to send experts to the scene for identification.</p>
<h3>Materials Movement Held, Liaison Meeting</h3>
<p>After the reorganization of the National General Chamber of Commerce, the authority to approve applications for the movement of major materials such as rice, wheat flour, cotton, cotton textiles, oils, grains, and daily necessities will be handled by the various control committees. In order to urge the various control committees to complete the movement of materials carefully and prevent the malpractices of smuggling and hoarding, the Chamber has specially stipulated that liaison meetings will be convened every Saturday and Sunday, gathering personnel in charge of material movement approval affairs from the various control committees to review and gradually improve matters related to movement applications.</p>
<h3>Municipal Industrial and Commercial Licenses, Deadline for Exchange</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau announced that since the Municipal Social Bureau and the Grain Bureau have been abolished one after another, all factories and businesses in the city that have applied for registration with the Social Bureau and the Grain Bureau and have received registration certificates must, from yesterday (the 21st) to December 20th, bring their original registration certificates to the Bureau on Taishan Road to re-register. They will be exempted from the registration fee and given a registration certificate from the Bureau in order to ensure uniformity. Those who delay registration beyond the deadline will be punished in accordance with Article 11 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of Factory Registration and Article 8 of the Commercial Registration Rules. The Bureau has already notified the relevant trade associations to inform their members to handle this matter promptly.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Indiscriminate Bombing</h3>
<p>Recently, enemy American air forces stationed in Chongqing have frequently raided Shanghai. Yesterday, enemy aircraft again intruded from morning until afternoon. As the head of the Navy Press Department said, the enemy aircraft's attack on Shanghai was merely an attempt to achieve a psychological warfare effect. As a result of indiscriminate bombing, military facilities suffered no damage, while the damage and casualties were all suffered by Chinese civilians.</p>
<p>Shanghai is originally a commercial city with no important military facilities, so the enemy aircraft's air raids have no target to speak of and are merely bombing indiscriminately to disturb people's hearts. At this tense stage of the decisive battle, we must avoid the enemy aircraft's indiscriminate attacks due to impatience. If there are unscrupulous elements who take the opportunity to spread rumors, raise prices, and attempt to pursue exorbitant profits to disturb the market, we hope that the authorities will strictly crack down on them and do their utmost to prevent it.</p>
<p>The enemy's indiscriminate air raids are intended to disturb the minds of the citizens, so in order to shatter the enemy's scheme, the citizens must remain calm, and the authorities must assume the responsibility of stabilizing people's hearts.</p>
<p>Secondly, in order to adapt to the environment of air raids, citizens should be particularly frugal with water and electricity and develop habits of thrift.</p>
<h3>Compendium of Various Trade Unions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Plumbing and Carpentry Trade Union recently reported that its members have unanimously requested an increase in wages due to the pressure of making a living. After repeated discussions with all parties and the relevant authorities, it was decided that the wages of general workers would be increased as requested as follows! Carpenters will receive a daily salary of 350 yuan, apprentices 100 yuan per day, plumbers 340 yuan per day, and apprentices 120 yuan. The above is for those who board and lodge outside. This measure has already been implemented.</p>
<p>The Construction Industry Association recently received a notice from the Plumbing and Carpentry Trade Union that the wages of all workers would be increased from today. After the Association approved it, it notified its members to comply with the implementation.</p>
<p>The Old Flower Industry Association recently received a notice from the Income Tax Bureau that this year's income tax is about to expire. As for the income tax that each industry should pay in the coming year, they should prepare payment methods in the near future. After receiving the order, the Association notified all its members to comply.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
