<h3>「活人流星彈」　德報論神風隊</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　日神風特別攻擊隊，於菲律賓海戰中大事活動，盟邦德國國民感銘極深，二日各報均評此爲活人流星彈，論述如次：日軍於菲律賓方面作戰，使用轟炸攻擊機，恰可滑作德軍之流星彈，而於活人操縱，該機搭載有足够攻擊時使用之汽油，不準備歸途下燃料，所有沐死之飛行員，均爲受有特別訓練之滑年，現在爲數何止千百之「活人炸彈」，爲爭取勝利正等待摩身之時機。</p>
<h3>菲律賓內地　無艦機蹤影</h3>
<p>馬尼剌三日中央社電　菲律賓內地，一日整日無敵艦上機隻影出現，此種現象，不外敵殘留之航空母艦彈藥將盡，正準備自菲律賓遁逸之先兆。自菲律賓海面侵入之敵航空部隊及海上部隊，因遭日機隊與海上部隊之猛攻，瀕於潰減之事實已甚明瞭，現敵極爲狼狽，正極謀動員後方基地陸上兵力，更企圖奪回雷伊泰方面制空機，然因日空軍連日連夜之猛襲，已完全不得活用。此外成爲進攻菲律賓最大基地之培里琉，摩羅泰島，亦因日軍將兵之果敢猛攻，無暇擴張或修理機場，而危機深伏，且以運輸船多被擊沉，運輸中之軍需物資大半沉入海底，更以無空母保護運輸船團，故今後之補給必益趨困難，雷伊泰島方面，亦將愈形惡化，勢成迷途之孤兒。</p>
<h3>日機隊偵察　阿得米拉的</h3>
<p>拉巴爾三日中央社電　日基地偵察機隊，刻正以菲律賓作戰中之敵重要中繼根據地阿得米拉的</p>

<p>東京三日中央社電　日大政翼贊會與亞總本部，歡迎印度臨時政府主席鮑斯氏，特於三日下午一時半在日比谷公會堂舉行大演講會，首由翼贊總本部顧問建川中將代表主辦者致辭，繼由印度留學生會唱自由印度國歌，旋鮑斯氏起立講演，題目爲「決戰階段下印度之使命」，演說日語，充滿必勝之信念與決意，聽眾報以如雷之掌聲，繼更舉行紀念品贈呈儀式，下午四時二十分散會。</p>
<h3>雷伊泰島日軍　作果敢攻擊　薩馬島敵軍一部蠢動</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日陸軍在雷伊泰羣島之作戰情况：雷伊泰島戰事日趨激烈化，該方面日海軍及陸上部隊，正連日連夜與敵展開激戰，情勢至爲壯烈，茲雷伊泰島敵登陸部隊已由南方向夫羅亭至塔克羅班戰綫逐次推進，擴大其立足點，同時更整備塔克羅班及塔拉克兩地之機場，力謀以此爲基地空軍之發動根據地，於是日機隊乃不斷日夜對之施以猛炸，着着搜索飛抵該兩機場之敵機，而予以痛擊，蓋足以決定該方面之戰爭情勢者，實在於制空權之有無，日機有鑑於此，乃不惜繼續作積極之活躍，以確保該方面之制空權。在陸戰中，日軍亦迫逼敵陳，而作果敢之攻擊，尤其在塔克羅班方面，日軍已組成肉搏挺進隊，俟機反攻。另一方面，敵亦曾經派遣兵力約一師，在雷伊泰島南方登陸，茲雷伊泰島之敵，若包括塔克羅班二師，塔拉克二師在內，則已增至五師之眾。此外，敵軍一部，在薩馬島登陸後，亦在蠢動中。塔克羅班方面，日機隊亦於三十一日强襲敵機場，使其設施五處起火，更於十一月一日，邀擊敵B24型機，卒收獲擊落敵機八架之戰果，而把握戰場上之制空權，敵軍雖遭日軍之果敢攻擊，但仍藉其物力，繼續强行發動登陸作戰，由是戰局日趨激烈。自敵軍利用塔克羅班，塔拉克兩機場以來，敵機之抵抗益形激烈。</p>
<p>馬尼刺三日中央社電　確保雷伊泰島溪谷要衝之日軍，對來襲塔加米方面之敵，連日加以猛攻，予以重創，損毀其戰車十數輛，同時並以肉搏攻擊，鹵獲戰車二輛，破壞十五生的迫擊砲二門，敵軍死傷甚眾，然仍不顧犧牲，頑强進攻。據美方消息，攻擊塔加米方面之美第七師，二十七·八兩日於泥水壕溝中陷於苦戰，第九十六師亦參加該攻擊戰。同方面之戰鬥，自登陸以來，極爲劇烈。又據三十日美方廣播，哈洛哥至雷伊泰谷溪間戰綫，二十九日美軍在機槍及砲火掩護下，沿山道前進，是時日軍忽自戰壕逃出敢行衝鋒，激戰六小時後，美軍迫自山腹地帶敗退。</p>
<p>摩培兩島日軍奮戰</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　摩鹿加羣島之摩羅泰島方面，敵軍約一師團登陸後，該島日陸上部隊，當即加以邀擊，五旬以來，神出鬼沒，以果敢之肉搏挺身戰法，抑制敵軍擴大地盤，並不斷妨碍敵軍之整備，機塲及敵機之葉結，連日績行積極奮勇之作戰，使敵不寒而憟，惟敵刻仍積極在摩羅泰·培里琉兩島設立前進基地，作爲進攻菲律賓之根據地，並推進其基地之航空部隊及機動隊之航空兵力，以謀掌握菲律賓戰域之制空權，但該兩島日守軍，刻正發揮其善謀敢鬥之精神，在該方面極力抑制敵軍之策動，對菲律賓作戰上，實頗多貢獻。敵登陸以來，直至十月二十五日，其間摩泰島日守軍所獲之絲合戰果，經判明者如次：（一）日軍殺傷敵兵員約一千五百人，（二）經日軍炸毀或收獲之敵方兵器，有十五生的砲二門，迫擊砲一門，機槍·砲車暨通信各種設施，彈藥，衛生材料等無數，此外，並毀減敵司令部幕舍十七所，掩蓋陳地數處。</p>
<h3>東亞東西兩綫　防衛力鞏固</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　大東亞戰局自敵美逐漸西侵以來，一時曾有頗呈嚴重之勢，但近三週來，盟邦日軍之台葬通捷，及廣西作戰之勢如破竹，不僅已使不安空氣，完全一掃，且因日軍所顯示之偉大威力，更使吾人之必勝信念，愈益堅定。蓋自上月敵美軍先後侵略台灣琉球菲律賓方面，企圖直接中國大陸沿岸，切斷日本與南方之連絡後，經日軍奮勇邀擊，已予敵軍以致命打擊。其第五十八機動部隊，殆已完全潰減，敵美之此種冒險西侵，其內面之另一原因，不外爲羅斯福欲以之爲競選工具，而日軍即按照誘敵深入計劃，作澈底殘減敵人之攻勢。菲島地形複雜，日軍防衛堅强，敵軍冒險深入日軍腹地，其爲自投羅網，不難想像。今後雖欲圖增援，以期解圍，但因補充困難，實已陷於進退維谷之勢。同時日本在大陸上作戰之順利，亦足與太平洋海戰互相呼應。蓋就大陸戰綫言，最近日軍席捲豫湘要地，更突入廣西，其要衝桂林，已陷於重圍，淪陷迫於眉睫。如此業已打通了平漢綫，已爲防衛大陸之長城。渝美在平粵漢以東之各基地，則完全無能爲力，如此，綜觀海陸雙方陳勢，大東亞之內綫防衛，已異常堅强，今日桂林一旦失陷，渝美空軍在中國大陸之勢力，即將完全崩潰，而最近駐渝美空軍司令斯蒂威爾因與渝蔣意見不合辭職，更可見敵美內心之焦躁。蓋美國因太平洋及大陸兩方失利，乃力圖使渝軍美國化，利用渝方人力物力，以期圖挽回頺局。其陰謀之毒辣，可想而知。吾人於此，應一面以沉着冷靜之頭腦，把握戰局現勢，一面以熱烈興奮之情緒，努力本位職責，以爭取戰爭之最後勝利。</p>
<h3>緬邊森林作戰　西非軍敗走　日機轟炸密芝那機塲</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫三日中央社電　阿拉坎方面及邦塞巴撒方面之敵西非軍八十一師，十六日突出現於加拉頓河及比河中間之孟多山采，企圖遮斷日軍後方，日軍則於二十二·三兩日，展開先發制人之攻擊，與數倍於日軍之敵軍展開森林戰，敵終於狼狽向緬印國境敗走，棄屍三百具，迫擊砲，自動步槍等無算。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據合眾社駐印渝軍司令部特派員二日報道稱，日機於數日前曾對北緬密芝那機場作夜間轟炸，擊毀美機數架，嗣後一連兩夜，均有日機數架來襲，由此美軍於夜間均藏避於防空壕屯中。</p>
<h3>以東亞民族總力　爭取最後勝利　周代院長林部長廣播</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　行政院周代院長，於昨日（二日）下午九點三十分，爲紀念中日同盟條約週年，廣播演講，大要如下：</p>
<p>中日兩國的親善關係，在過去四年中間，固然無時無刻不在增進之中，但是互相尊重，互相提携的堅固基礎，却是由於同盟條約的締結而益趨稱定。中日同盟條約的締結而益趨穩定。中日同盟條約乃是中日併肩作戰，聯合一致擊減英美的決心的具體化，同時也是中國得到獨立自由的保障。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭現在已進入了最後的決勝階段，中日兩國在同盟的立場上，自然應該有更進一步的提携，作更進一步的協力。在現實的國際情勢下，兩國同一利害，同一前途，同一命運的關係，是格外顯明了。一定要大東亞戰爭取得最後勝利，中國的復興，日本的繁榮，以及整個大東亞的解放，纔能達到。英美在目前還沒有放棄侵略東亞妄念，殘餘勢力還在謀掙扎，大東亞戰爭在短時期內，是不能解決的。我們當然還要繼續苦鬥，繼續努力，以東亞全民族的總力，去消減英美殘餘的力量。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭現在已揭開決戰的序幕，盟邦日本最近的赫赫戰果，已奠定了勝利的基礎。東亞解放的前途，已呈着燦爛光明的狀態，我們相信明年今日，大東亞戰爭的最後勝利，必能成功。</p>
<p>林部長廣播</p>
<p>南京三日中央社電　林宣傳部長，三日以紀念中日同盟條約，大東亞共同宣言，應有的努力爲題，廣播演講，大意爲目前戰爭所當努力的，自以完遂戰爭，確保勝利爲第一要義。去年元旦，主席所訓示的肅正思想，保障治安，增加生產三個重點，都是戰爭必勝的要素，也都是同盟參戰的中國所應盡的義務。中日同盟條約已經啓了平等自由約端，保持這個開端，使之日趨進步。目前就是要努力做到以上三點，以求大東亞戰爭的完遂。最後，我們爲生存獨立，展開殊死的鬥爭，第一，必須團結全國民眾，堅決反對英美侵略主義者，藉中國爲戰場而焦土中國。第二，我們必須團結全東亞民族，堅決反對英美侵略主義者，以東亞人殘殺東亞人。第三，我們必須喚起全世界被壓迫民族，堅決反對英美侵略主義者，再分割世界的分斷行爲。</p>
<h3>楠木中將　發表談話</h3>
<p>北平三日中央社電　日新任駐北平公使楠木寶隆中將，二日下午四時半於公使官邸，初次會見記者團，發表談話，要旨如次：刻日軍於中國及南太平洋上收獲擊減英美之偉大戰果，同時大東亞各盟邦，亦舉其總力真誠協力完遂戰爭。今中華民國舉國邁進，於戰力之增强有所帮助，日朝野對此甚爲感謝。此次本人奉令就任公使，深感使命之重大，決盡棉薄。同時並深信中國民眾必予以支援，以副對華北增强戰力之期待。無論戰局如何轉變，吾人決心決無變動，同時亦不容片刻懈怠。關於各種施策，當局已有周至計劃，徵諸現地朝野各方面意見，官民一體，完成華北所負至上重任，完遂大東亞戰爭云。</p>
<h3>皖省府更調　各縣區署長</h3>
<p>蚌埠三日中央社電　皖省政府於三日召開第四次省政府會議，由羅省長主席，決議要案多件。通過省銀行組織章程，并通過五河縣長李光源調定淮特區縣長，遺缺派關鐵桓接充。戎君石調定遠縣長，合肥縣長陳成辭職照准，調含山縣長夏敘堂代理。</p>
<h3>青少年總奮起　運動綱要頒佈</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　中國青少年團總團部，根據上月在我國首都召開之第二次大東亞青少年指導會議後，決於本年十二月八日至一月九日，全東亞青少年展開實踐興亞總奮起運動，特擬定「中國青少年實踐興亞總奮起運動計劃綱要」，頒佈全國各省市團部，遵照辦理。</p>
<h3>重慶內幕</h3>
<p>最近美國「生活」雜誌，曾發表了一篇最有興趣的重慶報告。作者是「生活」雜誌的特派員，過去曾担任遠東問題五年的塞羅德·槐特。我們（一）爲瞭解重慶的內幕，（二）爲認識敵美與重慶的勾結，節譯下來，以供讀者參考。近來美國內部，這類同工異曲，千篇一律的重慶批判文章，業已成爲一種風尚，但這是其中一篇最尖銳的文章。</p>
<p>地方雜牌軍閥，重慶政權內部的國粹派，以及中國共產黨，爲了共同目的而彼此相互結合，過去不能不說是失敗了。重慶「抗戰」陳營內部的不斷摩擦，美國也不能不負相當責任。美國對於重慶政權的許多諾言，全都未能十足兌現。今日重慶的一般情形，可以簡略地說，是封鎖，通貨膨脹，政治上無出路。</p>
<p>像重慶今日受到的封鎖，近代史上真不多見，自從一九四二年春，滇緬公路被日本封鎖以來，「抗戰區」的人民，完全靠自力更生的，自足自給的。滇緬公路封鎖前，中國擁有一萬五千多輛載重汽車，但目前只剩了五千輛，其餘則全都成爲無用的長物了。這兩種數字的不同，就是表示重慶的悲劇，河南省和廣東省的飢饉，因無載重汽車，而各地賑濟的食糧也無法運去。遍地哀鴻餓殍，任野狗吞食，而鄉下人不得不挺而走險。這樣一來，工場則無法取得原料，於是引起中央對各省統治力的衰弱，以及國內交易組織的逐漸麻痺。</p>
<p>渝軍面有菜色</p>
<p>重慶軍隊，只有靠徒步行軍。有時候，數師人馬，不能不浩浩蕩蕩步行二千五百公里。赤脚而面有菜色的士兵們，在岩石滿地的崎嶇道路上，圍繞山轉，看到這種現實，總會覺得悲慘。在前綫上，食糧的給養完全沒有，士兵們往往終日不得食。士兵們爲取得老百姓的食物，而賣掉軍毯，深夜在山中爲防衛寒氣的侵襲，而相互擁抱着睡。我知道，有一個隊伍在八百公里的行軍中，曾死去全部兵員的十分之三。其餘活着的兵士，經過美國醫生的診治，其中患肺病者是百分之十五。</p>
<p>此外經濟封鎖幾乎使重慶的軍需生產陷於不可能。即看一下微乎其微的子彈生產量，也會使英美軍事專家氣餒</p>
<p>紙幣價值毫無</p>
<p>重慶第二個重要問題，就是通貨膨脹，課稅業已達到了飽和點。充實國家財政的工業利潤，也沒有。所以重慶只有印刷紙幣來支持戰爭。去年重慶曾發行了四十億元紙幣。今年或許也要發行這樣多。這種無限制的通貨膨脹，影響了國民道德。重慶政權下的中國官民間的腐敗，隨處可以看到。紙幣幾乎完全失掉了價值，所以人民也就不重視錢了，也就不想存錢了。</p>
<p>向農民徵稅和徵募壯丁的工作，也是黑暗重重。如能買通有關當局，壯丁是可以避免的。由於這樣通貨膨脹的情形，交戰區內，的確呈現出一各奮妙的現象來。換言之，在交戰區比較安定的地方，在進行着奇奇怪怪的交易。這種交易就是向重慶方面輸入醫藥品，衣類及其他必要品，固然是一件好事，但重慶軍人中因有利可圖，便與奸商利徒勾結實行走私。</p>
<p>通貨膨脹與經濟封鎖，全是戰爭的產物。但重慶內部的最大政治暗礁，並非戰爭責任的問題。重慶打敗仗，一向是無人負責的，這實在是今古奇觀。重慶內部的國民黨，實行高壓手段，這也是沒到過重慶的人難於想像的。簡直一般人民對於國民黨，恨入骨髓。由於國民黨檢查制度的嚴酷，而雜誌報章上只能刊載一些茶餘飯後的閑話，和政府交下的「官樣文章」。飢饉，政治逮捕，通貨膨脹，經濟封鎖，外交，政府要人等重大問題，都不許人民置喙</p>
<p>民間怨聲載道</p>
<p>蔣介石的本人固然有很多缺點，但仍不失重慶政權的領袖，他依然被一羣拍馬奉迎之官僚所包圍。蔣介石指揮下的軍隊，常遭協約國（尤其英美）的斥責，以及國共摩擦問題，飢饉問題，這都是令人最痛心的事。蔣一個人所作的事情，非常多。就是這樣，人民對於他仍有無數怨言，他不得民心的原因，非常簡單，或由於現物徵稅問題，或由於農民徵發問題。但這種極端不滿與憤慨，是不敢表現於外的。因爲重慶政權並不是一個民主國家，所以只好敢怒而不敢言。（安譯自十月二日每日新聞）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>蘇浙省政的期待</h3>
<p>本月二日國府命令，江蘇省長陳羣氏調任考試院長，以任援道氏繼不久以前，浙江省長傅式說氏調長建部，而以項政荘氏繼任。中區對於江浙兩省省長的更迭，惟一的原因與目的，自然是期望兩省政治的刷新與進步，已無疑義了。</p>
<p>去年九月間，江蘇省長士羣氏逝世後，由陳羣氏繼任之時，我們曾於九月十一日十二日以及十月四日，迭論江蘇省政的重要，並貢獻管見，今日重加檢閱，深覺去年所言仍爲今日所需要，而檢討一年餘來蘇省政治的進退得失，實未敢率爾作讚頌之詞。</p>
<p>我們去年對於江蘇省政貢獻的意見，是（一）中央政治與地方政治同樣有革新的必要，地方政治的革新，應自江蘇爲始，因爲蘇省在全國各省中無論從地域，政治，經濟，敎育文化各方面以觀，莫不居於最重要地位。從地域而言，乃爲首都所在，以及東方著名商埠上海市亦位於本省。從經濟而言，江南向稱富庶之區。從敎育文化而言，本省乃人文最盛，敎育發達之區。因此，江蘇省之政治措施，在全國各省中實有模範作用，抑且對於中央政治發生唇齒相輔之關係。（二）今後蘇省政治，絕對需要專家政治，而淘汰官僚政治，現代政治內容，自決定以至執行過程中，隨時隨地需要科學頭腦運用處理，重視時間，爭取效率，絕非官僚主義，　預敷衍，所能應付。（三）從速開始地方自治工作，建立民意機構，提高人民參政意識，促成政府與人民打成一片。（四）廢除地方苛捐雜稅，減輕農民負担。</p>
<p>就政治現狀不進則退的原則而言，維持現狀，就是失敗。沒有成績，就是人民的苦痛未除。過去的省行政，至多不過維持現狀，談不到成績。現在省長旣經更迭，自當有一新面目的精神，我們除提供上述意見以外，對於人事問題，再陳所見如次：</p>
<p>（一）登用人員，絕對採取人才主義。我們認爲凡是不能任用人才者，則任用者本人定不是人才；凡是任用者本人是人才，則定能任用人才的。</p>
<p>（二）對於各方面的推荐請託，必須有勇氣排除情面，完全因事擇人，不能因人設事。</p>
<p>（三）縣爲地方政治的基層，縣長人選極爲重要，提高職權，提高待遇，慎重銓衡，慎重考績。</p>
<p>（四）地方軍隊，第一步必須做到不擾民，然後才能維護治安。擾民之兵，必不能保民；保民之兵，則決不會擾民，乃爲不易之理。</p>
<p>任援道氏爲蘇人，項致荘氏爲浙人，我們並不存有地域觀念而主張蘇人治蘇，浙人治浙，但從服務桑梓，地方情形比較熟悉而言，對於任項兩氏更致其殷切的期待。尤其在目前大東亞戰爭緊張的決戰階段，最需要我們貢獻戰力，同時，和平區內匪共潛伏，時圖發動之際，隨時隨地，是地方長官殫精竭慮爲國効命的最迫切時期，更希望身　軍政重寄的任項兩氏，把握此報國的良好時機。</p>

<h3>是軍以半圓形　包圍桂林市　南北兩車站正展開激戰中</h3>
<p>廣西前綫三日中央社電　日軍直迫桂林市，已於一日晚在市街西北岩山地帶至南將軍磯（桂林右岸）一帶地區，（該一帶地區距桂林三公里，）以半圓形包圍桂林市，刻該地積極緊縮包圍圈中，並以有力部隊開抵岩山圩。另一路日軍，亦於擊潰渝第三十八軍後，經恭城西北方開抵二塘圩，（渝二十六軍司令部所在地，平樂東方十八公里，）因之死守桂林之渝三十一軍一百三十一師，一百七十師，及七十九軍之一部，已勢如成袋中之鼠云。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍當局發表桂林之渝軍守備隊，於南北兩軍站正激戰中。便於西北郊外地區，已無法阻止日軍之前進云。</p>
<p>廣州日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍委會一日發表戰報，承認日軍已自東西及東北方進抵桂林，原電如次：一日軍已進抵桂林外廊之渝軍陳地，一部日軍三十日强行渡過桂江，三十一日到達桂林城北之北車站，現北站已展開激戰。又日軍另一隊自大圩鎮渡湘江進攻，目下激戰。又一部是靈水塘迫近桂林東側，抵達桂林郊外之圍背村附近，（桂林郊外一公里半，）至三十一日夜仍在激戰中。二日沿北方渡桂江南下之日軍，已佔領靈川城，目下戰事已移向靈川南方。又至龍虎鎮向西南進擊之日軍，三十日晨已抵達恭城（平樂東北三十五公里，）北方十公里之處，又自南方平南西進之日軍，繼向武宣進攻中。</p>

<h3>任援道長蘇　各方深致期待</h3>
<p>蘇州三日中央社電　此次中致會一四一次會議通過蘇省陳羣氏爲考試院長，省垣各界因陳省長治蘇年餘，頗著政聲，此次榮轉，一致深表惋惜。同時任援道氏網長江蘇，無不深爲歡迎。僉認任新省長久任第一方面軍總司令，其所屬各部隊又大部駐於蘇省各要地，担負保衛地方之責。此次任氏以省長而兼綏靖主任，今後對於軍政雙方之運營，當必能愈益發揮其效能。是以清鄉發祥地之蘇省，清鄉工作亦將更有飛躍之進展。且因治安之確保，增產工作亦可順利推進，故蘇省人士，對於任新省長藏任後軍政施策一元化的推進，無不深爲期待。</p>
<h3>納爾遜　將再度訪渝</h3>

<h3>渝蔣積極　準備對付共黨</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　史蒂威爾返國後，渝美間相剋，益形深刻化。英美兩國新聞機關乘機對渝方大加攻擊。合眾社新德里分社訪員卅一日訊，美政府對重慶之協力，不表滿足，故羅斯福乃特派納爾遜及哈雷赴渝，擬與重慶政府，商討關於渝方協力反軸心軍作戰之問題。蔣介石氏勉强容納美方要求，但爲體面計，乃要求羅斯福召還史蒂威爾大將，且舉出責難理由多點。美方則謂此次史蒂威爾之返國，與蔣氏所列之理由，因軍事機密關係，未能發表。然於事實視之，過去數年間之重慶政權，其內部分裂，危機至大。美國則不予發表，認其原因有二：首因重慶採取檢查制度，再則認爲重慶之混亂，不久即可恢復原狀。然此種混亂與日俱增，終至於史蒂威爾之召回。據於去春自重慶來新德里者談，謂自美國輸入重慶之武器貸與品，並未用於對日作戰方面，重慶爲備日從事內戰，故全部予以收藏。現在百萬渝軍配置中國北部，防備共產黨，故渝軍在各地戰場，對日軍僅不過爲名義上之抵抗，他方重慶政權之有力者則操縱金融外匯市場，中飽私囊云云。吾等記者深知此項事態，但過去對於此種消息，則不能隨意報告。至蔣氏領導之國民黨政權，認今後不可避免之內戰，較對日作戰，尤爲重要，時刻準備防止八十萬中國共產黨員，余在中緬印戰綫從軍約二年，深悉蔣氏當前要務，在與中國共產黨鬥爭，於重慶並無民主主義存在，且尚未有完壁之獨裁政權。若國民黨政權者，縱謂重慶無言論等自由，亦非過言云。</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統　競選演說</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　海通社迅，華盛頓息：羅斯福總統自白宮發表競選之廣播演說，其內容並不嚴覆杜威對渠之抨擊，專事述及軍事與政治之問題。渠稱關於戰事之動向與和平之組織，仍照原定途徑進行之，惟有如是，始能迅速結束戰爭，與減少人力與物力之犧牲。美國在和平之建設工作中，當取領導之地位。若吾人縱容共和黨，以和平轉變爲政黨間之紛爭，則無論大國或小國皆感失望。</p>

<p>希臘德軍　紛紛北撤</p>
<p>希臘德軍續退，已放棄薩隆尼加，以便至洪境助戰。克羅提亞境內之紅軍及游擊隊企圖阻撓，故德軍必須打通薩隆尼加至貝爾格勒之公路及鐵路綫，現東南歐各地之德軍紛紛集中，故其實力已益見堅强矣。</p>

<h3>繆斯河下遊　德軍力戰阻敵　華島孤軍仍繼續抵抗</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　海通社訊：布拉彭特西北反軸心軍，對德軍在荷闌許狄普以南及繆斯河下游之最後陳地，繼續施强大壓力，但蒙高茂萊將軍不能迅速佔領摩爾狄傑克，萊姆唐克維爾及凱士維爾之渡橋，且有能阻止德十五軍退至繆斯河與瓦爾河之間，故不得不集中大軍以渡河。但河南尚有德軍之橋頭在焉，繆斯河橋頭堡德軍之防守，頗見活躍，故英加軍向荷蘭許狄普及繆斯河下游之正面攻擊，前途尚不光明，因此蒙高茂萊將軍惟有由尼美根橋頭堡向西突破，或用大批空運軍在後方作戰，現雖比較不重要，但所牽製之反軸心軍爲數則甚多，現敵軍已入弗勒欣河及其港，無如該港業已完全被毀。華爾契倫島之德防軍，雖遭受優勢敵軍之壓迫，但仍步聖瑪羅·加萊等處德守軍作戰精神繼續抵抗。</p>
<h3>德勝利信念　絕不動搖</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　海通社訊，德宣傳部長郭培爾在最新出版之德意志週刊著文稱：迄今戰事尚無勝負可言，唯最後之一戰可決勝負。對布爾雪維克主義投降之各國領袖，均係來自資產階級，未得其人民之信任與擁護，故無力阻止其人民精神上之崩潰。最有決心之國家始能戰勝，因其願爲其作戰之主義犧牲一切，德國乃此種國家，因此勝利與失敗均握在其手中，一任其選擇耳。</p>

<h3>蘇指摘羅政府　違反停戰協定</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電　據莫斯科電，蘇政府頃由塔斯社發表聲明：痛資羅馬尼亞政府違背停戰條件行爲。其大意謂，羅軍於作戰期中，在島克蘭及貝薩拉比亞運去多數機器，停戰條件中規定須交還上項掠奪之機器，然羅政府竟隱患事實拒絕交還。停戰條件規定肅清國家機關，羅政府亦遲不實行，羅國雖已逮捕戰爭責任者五百名法西斯黨員，然鐵衛團一派，仍佔有國家機關之要職，從事反薩行動。</p>

<h3>警局取締引火性　爆發危險物　維持治安防止不幸事件</h3>
<p>關於實施取締引火性及爆發性危險物，警察當局發表談話如下：</p>
<p>如本日上海特別市警察局佈吿，自十一月六日（星期一）起，實施取締引火性及爆發性危險稱。關於危險性物品，於平時對於維持治安上實有嚴重取締之必要，尤於現今戰時下，更應徹底加以取締。爾今敵機屢犯上海地區，爲完備防空工作，防止由於爆發引火等之危險物，引出不幸事件計，決實施斯項取締措置，洵爲當然之對策。而於取締目的，如前所述，係爲確保本之治安，並非施行强制收買，但經調查之結果，依貯藏地位，及貯藏場所之構造，貯藏數量之如何，於非常時防止危險事件發生上，對危險得令遷移或分散之，此點尚希各界諒解。</p>
<p>再於佈吿中所指定之危險物，其所有或委託保管者，應不論其數量之多寡，及職業如何，應於指定期內，向經濟保安處所屬就近之經濟警察隊，領取由請用紙，完成登記，登記手績與往昔同。</p>
<p>此項取締與一般商品登記不同，其有朱登記者，按法除嚴重懲罰外，並將貯藏之危險品予以沒收，仰參照佈吿，勿爲遠反爲要。</p>
<h3>顧保甲處長談　改善保甲行政　昨日舉行記者例會</h3>
<p>本市警察局保甲處處長顧繼武，於昨（三）日上午十時，出席市府宣傳處第二十六次記者例會，會見本市各報社記者，宣傳處處長梁秀予亦准時偕同秘書潘比德蒞會，即席由梁處長致詞，繼由顧處長就記者所提出之問題，答覆　詳，至中午十二時始學。</p>
<p>索取表格毋須付費　（一）本市各分局保甲股，對於市民前往購買移動證時，亦有推稱上峯尚未發下，暫不出售，以致拖延數星期之久，保甲處對於此事，曾有所聞吾，如此後再有發現，有何補救辦法？（答）關於移動證申請需索問題，在本年六月以前，舉凡移動證申請盡及報吿青等，亦早經規定收費額，由各分局直接解繳保甲處，轉第一區公署會計處，自六月以後，全市警政合併後，各分局之各項表格收費，則交由總務處彙集後，轉繳市府總會計處，如前二星期缺乏申請需之情形，事已過去，當初因於預算關係，在印刷品上不無有遲滯之處，致引起頗多流言，後經本處即謀措補辦法，以應亟需，即先行籌款印刷，陸續撥發各區分局，應市民之需索，故在供給上言，當無問題。本來移動，出生，死亡等等之申請需之規定收費，須在居民將手績塡具完竣後，乃繳付規定之手績費並掣給手據，在索表格之初時可不必繳付，如各處有流弊情事，本處決予通令查究，務使絕跡。</p>
<p>計劃改善自警編製　（二）多令轉瞬即屆，今年冬防問題較前更爲重要，未知保田處對於保甲自警團如何協助冬防工作，已有預定計劃否？（答），值茲節近初冬，對於冬防上措施，至爲重要’太處曁自警團團本部亦深爲感到。查自警團團本部自本年九月九日成立後，積極調查服役免役之自警團員之工作，凡年在十八歲以上，四十五歲以下之男子，均須逐一調查，至今此項工作猶未完畢，俟待就緒後，即整理分別免役服役者。查過去之自警團，乃以各分爲單位，尚有缺乏聯防性質，爲確立人民之自警自衛具體方案起見，乃有普及調查之必要，以避免各項代一崗之流弊，及在觀瞻方面，亦可紏正。在各區自警團員調查完畢後，即由團本部予以具體編製，計有三種：（一）編制模範團員，以智識靑年爲對象，養成自警自衛及防空上指導者，公別在各本區服務，模範團員之選別，由各區智識靑年負擔之。（二）設置基本團員，企劃在本市各大商店，工廠，學校，及人口較多之家庭，選取身壯力健者加以訓練，以多服務爲原則，予以生活上之待遇，尚有失業炎青年及朱就業之靑年，亦當編制爲基本團員。總之，基本團員能粗具智識者，均可參與，以資加强基本陣容。（三）預備團員之設置，乃考慮一般各大公司銀行錢莊店主及經理之便利，蓋因地位上及事業上之關係，在事實上深感不便，予以內勤及經濟負責，以囊助效力地方爲原則，故在預備團員之編制，周密審核。一般普通團，員即在平時服役值崗之自警團員，今後對於團員之編制，及各項經費之支出，已較七八二月改善良多，可益感便利。</p>
<p>督促分局改善服務　（三）市民中請具領居住證，保甲當局雖三令五申，督飭警局辦事人員，設法予市民以種種便利，但事實上仍非常麻煩，尤以不識字民衆，每因托人塡寫姓名年齡繼貫等等，有所不合，常致往返再三，依然不得嬰領，最感痛古，希望保田處亟謀改善，或令警局辦事人員剴切指導。</p>
<p>（答），本處專事爲保甲工作，以服務人民爲原則，亦即民衆與警察間之工作，舉凡各級保甲之機構，乃即民間機構，而各分局之保甲股，向爲警局機構，本處在執行保甲行政時，由警局分令各該分局傳令各股，而在各股之人事方面，亦由警局總務處甄選，至於本流弊情事，則由督察處負責，而本處乃就主管事務上指示指揮，最近陳兼局長，對於各分局之各股，已規定由主管處在事務上加以密切連絡，故今後本處自當密切督促，各分局保甲股連絡指揮，其工作當爲改善，而本處所負責任，定能以孚諸君及所屬各區居民之一期望。</p>
<h3>中儲檢金開始　強化金融機關　增調審核放款</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行檢查金融業務處，奉委辦理强化上海特別市金融機關業務，已依遵財政部頒佈之强化綱要條文之規定，擬訂實施薪理，通兩各金融機關遵照辦理，其金融機關之每日存款額不足規定數額者，均須依法於三十四年三月二十一日以前限期內，辦理增資手績，或合併改組，否則逾限即依法勒令停業。至於放款業務，即日起須經申請核准後，方許承放，該處爲嚴密辦理金融機關申請放款之審核事宜，已在審查組下，增設審核科，專責辦理申請核准各金融機關放款業務，並愼密檢查百分之三十存款支付預備金。據中央社記者探悉，本市金融機關須辦理增資手績者，佔百分之七十以上，因財政部規定增資期限有五個月之限期，故各金融機關，可從事準備充實組織。</p>
<h3>逾時營業　永受停電處分　已有若幹干商店等被罰</h3>
<p>市政當局爲節制電力，限制各業營業時間，普通各業商店及各種攤版，須於下午七時打烊，娛樂場所每晚十時打烊，十一時關熄電燈，居戶於十二時後，均須將電燈一律關熄，惟查尚有藐視法令，不遵限定時間者，尤其黃浦老閘泰山各區，因娛樂場所薈萃，經各該分局嚴加督飭管理，着令各業商店及娛樂場所等特種營業，必須嚴格遵行，如違第一次予以警吿，再犯當照章停止供給電力，且永久不予恢復，現已有若干商店及娛樂場所，遭受是項停電處分。</p>

<h3>鑒田大尉年紀尖瀝　日軍必勝信念　力申擊滅英美艦隊決心</h3>
<p>盟邦陸海外三報道當局，於昨（三）日下午三時，假外灘匯中飯店，聯合接見本市中國新聞記者團，即席由艦隊報道部鹽田大尉，力申太平洋上日本艦隊擊滅英美之決心。茲誌其談話如次：</p>
<p>痛擊敵方殘餘艦隊　自從十月十二日起到十一月二日止，平均每日均有日本大本營戰報之發表，而每决發表，日軍均獲有重大戰果，是故敵方太平洋艦隊，幾已全部殲滅，然而吾人對此偉大戰果，仍未能滿足，吾人必須將敵方太平洋艦隊，與印度洋方面英國艦隊，予以完全擊滅，蓋彼等存在之日，實爲大東亞戰爭完成之障碍。目下聯合艦隊，正在待機而作，以期一舉而殲盡敵方，另有一部份聯合艦隊，正在向雷伊泰及菲島東方海面殘餘之敵方兵力追擊。此番第一次作戰，已經吿一　結束，吾人正在準備第二次作戰，敵美艦隊與英國艦隊殘餘茍能存在，將必延長大東亞戰局，目下吾人預測敵方殘留戰艦，尚有數艘，航空母艦三四艘</p>
<p>雷島敵軍四面楚歌　敵方擬在雷伊泰設立之航空基地，以新幾內亞夏威夷等地作補給航空力量，但目下所殘留一二艘航空母艦，在一二天內實可能遭遇殲滅之命運，敵方雖增加一師團兵力於雷伊泰，（現敵方在雷伊泰共有五師團兵力）然各方均遭阻碍，四面楚歌，備極不安之情狀，反之，現在制海制空之權，已操入日本之手，敵方已無法可以挽回頽勢。</p>
<p>加強團結共保東亞　目下中心，將從菲島而轉入摩洛泰與培利琉方面，蓋日本兵力己非單獨向菲岛進攻，乃向麼洛泰及培利琉分別攻擊，此點即可表示日本之攻擊，已轉變矣。現距美大總統選舉期已日近一日，羅斯福爲此焦急萬分，因此敵方必將以塞班方面及中國大陸方面之空軍，向日本果京實施空襲，此舉實在意料之中。值茲大東亞宣言週年紀念之日，吾人更應努力合作，允其加强大東亞各國之團結力，則任何困難，均可打破也。</p>
<h3>日基督教領袖賀川談話</h3>
<p>國騐着名之日本基督敎領袖賀川豐彥，昨日會見記者時宣稱：國際間惟有在經濟上，社會上，科學上，政治上，及敎育上合作，方能保持永久和平，日本在生活之各方面，皆有合作制度，故即使歷時三十世紀，美國亦不能征服日本，於此亦可證明世界之合作，可以維持、永久和平。美國欲於戰後恢復國際聯盟，實屬愚蠢，第一次國際聯盟因完全略經濟合作之因素，遂致失敗，第二次國聯，亦必因同一理由而失敗，實至爲明顯。日本之資源，不及美國，但因有經濟合作制度，故能作戰三年，使美國無從征服日本，在科學方面，美國以爲日本落後亦屬錯誤，日本在重工業方面極有成就。中日戰爭初起時，許多人不明日本爲解放東亞而戰之心，但大東亞戰爭自開始以來，即已演變爲解放東亞民族之戰，即使歐戰結束，日本仍將繼續作戰，以解放東亞，羅斯福與邱士口爾未能實踐基督教義，日基督教徒深以爲恥。</p>

<h3>整理四站弊的意見</h3>
<p>— 寒若</p>
<p>因爲火車班次與車輛減少，一般旅行者，視乘火車旅行爲荊棘之途，車票之不易購買，車站及車上職員之任意凌人，籍端勒索，爲戰時任何地方所未見者，過去事實，屢見不鮮。華鐵最高當局，整飭有心，一般人士股盼改革，但具體有效之整飭改革辦法，迄未獲得，而旅行者受魚肉如故，近且加厲變本，方興未艾；以一國之重要交通工具，竟受少數喪心病狂者之控制，以作個人謀利工具，而主管當局反無法整飭取締，任令惡跡蔓延，吾以爲華鐵及建設部常局殊難辭其咎也。</p>
<p>查目前旅客所感最麻煩者有三：（一）車衆難以購買，（二）有車票而進站上車不易，（三）能僥倖上車而須受車上車僮滋擾。吾人平心靜氣檢討旅行者所受之三項痛苦，除第一項鐵路當局處理較爲困難外，其他兩項，實爲鐵路局之人事管理問題，外界人士，殊難置錄。關於第一項，車票難買，實因目前爲戰時，鐵路實材來源減少，車皮機關車製造不易。同時軍運及物資遝輸較重要於旅客運送，於是車輛減少，班决減少，但旅客並未滅少，反而增加，遂呈供不應求狀態，需要者衆，供給者少，價値自然提高，實爲百顚不破之經濟原理，此可歸之環境時勢使然，旅客與鐵路當局，均無錯過。但第二三兩項，旅客所受之無理壓迫，鐵路局似應負完全責任。一旅客購得車票，是業已取得乘車權利，如　票非假造者，縱購之於黑市，亦應任其登車，如今　據於改扎口之軋票員任意留難旅客，扣票勒索；維持秩序之站員毆辱旅客，强行檢查身份證，藉端索詐，不一而足。在僥倖通過改一扎口一關之後，登車之時，又須受　於車僮之類，撞門不放入內，推阻辱駡，百計要挾需索，擇肥而噬，非遂其慾不能登車。</p>
<p>吾人以爲自改扎口登，車至目的地，其間一切滋擾，除警務方面者外，鐵路當局應負完全責任，此爲鐵路局之人事管理不善，服務敎育欠週，只有鐵路局自反自兩，加强人事管理，勵行服務敎育，旅客始能免受不必要之痛苦。因此吾人對鐵路當局願提出以下數點，藉供參考</p>
<p>（一）職工生活待遇合理化，職工生活費之支給，是否合理，當局首先應注意，鐵路局對員工之生活狀况應首先明瞭，而加以調整使之合理化。</p>
<p>（二）加强人事管理，人一事管理加强中特別注意：嚴行考績，實施獎懲。此外對於服務法規章則，縝密訂正，服務敎育，不斷推行，以期提高鐵路員工服務道德。</p>
<p>（三）督察制度，督察制度於警察行政中佔重要地位，監督員司，熱誠奉公，防止實聯，極著成一效，鐵道行政中如有此項組織，應予加強，如未設立則不妨愈立，厲行艦督檢察服務員工，俾凟職者有所顧忌。</p>
<p>（四）獎勵告發　職，路局於車站及車上明顯之處，多多張貼告白，除　單指示旅客應行之事件外，對於受滋擾者指明告訴處所，並予獎勵，俾旅客有受非法虐待時樂予吿訴。</p>
<p>上述四點，吾人以爲標本兼治，鐵路當局有自反自肅精神毅然實施，嗣後旅行者之受益，將非淺鮮焉。</p>

<h3>Enemy Air Force Sortied Yesterday Morning, Fiercely Bombing Saipan and Tinian, Fires Erupted After Giant Bombs Landed on Enemy Airfields</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 3rd: Japanese air force units fiercely bombed enemy airfields on Saipan and Tinian Island at dawn on the 3rd. Fifteen locations on the ground were shattered by bombs, and raging fires erupted. The entire airfield area turned into a sea of fire. Three Japanese planes did not return from this operation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – From 1:30 AM to 3:30 AM on the 3rd, Japanese air force units conducted a surprise attack on enemy airfields on Saipan and Tinian Island, launching a preemptive strike against enemy B-29 bombers that were beginning to become active. The enemy airfields were completely destroyed. In this operation, Japanese planes dropped huge bombs on an enemy airfield north of Tinian Island, causing its facilities to burst into flames. In addition, a large number of bombs were dropped, causing major fires at various facilities. Another air force unit simultaneously launched a rapid attack on Aslito Airfield on Saipan Island, dropping large bombs and causing fires at six locations. They also fiercely bombed Orah Airfield, turning it into a sea of fire. Furthermore, Japanese attack units also achieved some combat results, and the enemy suffered a very severe blow this time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Kamikaze Squadrons Attack Enemy Convoys in Leyte Gulf, Enemy Ships in Surigao Strait Also Bombed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 3rd: (1) Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack squadrons attacked enemy convoys intruding into Leyte on the 1st, sinking one cruiser, destroying one battleship, one battleship or cruiser, one cruiser, and one destroyer belonging to the escort force. (2) From the 1st to dawn on the 2nd, Japanese air force units fiercely attacked enemy convoys in Leyte Gulf and the Surigao Strait, sinking one transport ship, one cruiser, and three destroyers.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 3rd (Central News Agency) – On the night of the 1st, Japanese air force units attacked enemy warships in Leyte Gulf, sinking a total of one cruiser and three destroyers. Another team of Japanese planes sank an enemy transport ship in Leyte Gulf that same night.</p>
<p>Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) – At dawn on the 1st, Japanese air force units continued to attack enemy airfields on Leyte Island. Five locations at Zero Klusu Airfield, three locations at Tacloban Airfield, and multiple locations at Sababro Airfield were set on fire, and one ground anti-aircraft machine gun installation was destroyed. On the 1st, about forty enemy B-24 aircraft that attacked from the direction of Barrot Island on Leyte Island were engaged in aerial combat by Japanese forces, resulting in nine being shot down. About twenty P-38 aircraft were shot down three by ground fire, and five were destroyed.</p>
<p>Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Since the evening of the 1st, the Japanese Army Air Force in the Philippines has continuously attacked the Tacloban and Tarac Airfields of the U.S. military day and night, shattering runways and ground facilities. On the same day, twenty U.S. P-38 aircraft were intercepted over western Leyte Island, nine were shot down, and one was destroyed.</p>
<h3>Overall Combat Results of Japanese Army Air Force Units</h3>
<p>Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Since the U.S. military began its counteroffensive in the Philippines, the Japanese Army Air Force has launched daily attacks on enemy warships and attacking enemy aircraft, achieving remarkable combat results. According to a statement by the local Japanese military authorities: From October 25th to 31st, one hundred and twenty-three enemy warships were sunk or destroyed (not including unconfirmed combat results). The details are as follows: (1) Sunk: 1 seaplane tender, 1 cruiser, 1 destroyer, 1 cruiser or destroyer, 6 transport ships, 152 landing craft. Destroyed: 1 aircraft carrier, 3 battleships, 3 battleships or cruisers, 2 cruisers, 9 destroyers, 15 transport ships, several landing craft, 2 unidentified ship types. Burned: 52 transport ships, several landing craft, 1 unidentified ship type. Other: 1 battleship and 1 cruiser each sustained four bullet hits, and the confirmed number of enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed was 94 (mainly shot down over Lamon Bay), 69 unconfirmed, and 177 aircraft destroyed on the ground.</p>
<h3>"Living Meteor Bombs" German Newspaper Discusses Kamikaze Squadrons</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack squadrons' major operations in the Philippine naval battles have deeply impressed the people of allied Germany. On the 2nd, various newspapers commented on this as "living meteor bombs," with discussions as follows: The Japanese military's use of bomber attack aircraft in operations in the Philippines can be aptly compared to the German army's meteor bombs. The aircraft, piloted by living humans, carries enough gasoline for the attack, with no fuel allocated for the return journey. All the death-defying pilots are specially trained youth, and now countless "living bombs" are waiting for the opportunity to offer their lives for victory.</p>
<h3>No Warships or Aircraft in the Interior of the Philippines</h3>
<p>Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) – On the 1st, no enemy warships or aircraft appeared in the interior of the Philippines the entire day. This phenomenon is likely a sign that the enemy's remaining aircraft carriers are running out of ammunition and preparing to flee the Philippines. The fact that the enemy air force and naval forces invading from the Philippine Sea have been severely depleted due to the fierce attacks by Japanese aircraft and naval forces is very clear. The enemy is now extremely flustered, desperately seeking to mobilize land forces from rear bases and attempting to regain air control over Leyte. However, due to the continuous day and night attacks by the Japanese Air Force, they have been completely unable to use them effectively. In addition, Peleliu and Morotai Islands, which have become the largest bases for attacking the Philippines, are facing a crisis due to the Japanese soldiers' brave and fierce attacks, leaving them no time to expand or repair their airfields. Moreover, with many transport ships sunk, most of the military supplies being transported have sunk to the bottom of the sea. With no aircraft carriers to protect the convoys, future supplies will inevitably become increasingly difficult. The situation on Leyte Island will also continue to deteriorate, becoming like an abandoned orphan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Units Reconnoiter Admirality Islands</h3>
<p>Rabaul, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Japanese base reconnaissance aircraft units are currently focusing on the ports of Lorengau in the Admiralty Islands, which are a crucial intermediate base for the enemy in the Philippines operation, closely monitoring the movements of enemy warships. At 3:00 PM on the 1st, the enemy warships anchored in that port consisted of four battleships (one of which was heavily listing, with the stern deck submerged in the water), one destroyer, and approximately twenty transport ships. In addition, the enemy aircraft parked at the Manus Island airfield consisted of only about twenty medium-sized aircraft. The situation at this important enemy base in the Central Pacific is very relaxed, and the enemy's supply route for the war in the Philippines is gradually shrinking.</p>
<h3>Indian Chairman Bose Gave a Speech in Japan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Asia General Headquarters welcomed Mr. Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India. A large lecture meeting was held at Hibiya Public Hall at 1:30 PM on the 3rd. First, Lieutenant General Tatekawa, advisor to the Imperial Rule Assistance Headquarters, delivered a speech on behalf of the organizers. Then, the Indian student association sang the "Free India" national anthem. Afterwards, Mr. Bose stood up and gave a speech entitled "India's Mission in the Decisive Stage," speaking in Japanese and filled with a conviction of victory and determination. The audience responded with thunderous applause. Afterwards, a commemorative gift presentation ceremony was held, and the meeting adjourned at 4:20 PM.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces on Leyte Island Launch Courageous Attacks, Part of Enemy Force on Samar Island Makes Provocative Moves</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The operational situation of the Japanese Army on Leyte Island: The fighting on Leyte Island is becoming increasingly fierce. Japanese naval and ground forces in that area are engaged in fierce battles with the enemy day and night, and the situation is extremely heroic. The enemy landing forces on Leyte Island have gradually advanced from the south toward the Frontin to Tacloban line, expanding their foothold. At the same time, they are preparing the airfields in Tacloban and Tarac, attempting to use them as bases for launching air force operations. Therefore, Japanese aircraft units are constantly bombing them day and night, and are diligently searching for and attacking enemy aircraft arriving at those two airfields. The factor that will ultimately determine the war situation in that area is the presence or absence of air superiority. Recognizing this, Japanese aircraft are continuing to operate actively in order to secure air superiority in that area. In ground battles, Japanese forces are also pressing the enemy lines and launching courageous attacks. Especially in the Tacloban area, Japanese forces have formed commando units for hand-to-hand combat, waiting for opportunities to counterattack. On the other hand, the enemy has also dispatched a force of approximately one division, landing in the southern part of Leyte Island. Now the enemy on Leyte Island, including the two divisions at Tacloban and the two divisions at Tarac, has increased to a total of five divisions. In addition, part of the enemy force has landed on Samar Island and is also making provocative moves. In the Tacloban area, Japanese aircraft units also raided enemy airfields on the 31st, causing fires at five locations. On November 1st, they intercepted enemy B-24 aircraft, ultimately achieving the victory of shooting down eight enemy aircraft, thereby seizing air superiority on the battlefield. Although the enemy forces have suffered courageous attacks by Japanese forces, they are continuing to forcefully launch landing operations by virtue of their material strength, and the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce. Since the enemy forces have been using the Tacloban and Tarac airfields, the resistance of enemy aircraft has become increasingly fierce.</p>
<p>Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Japanese forces securing the strategic Leyte Island valley have been fiercely attacking enemy forces attacking from the Tagami area for days, inflicting heavy losses and destroying more than ten tanks. At the same time, they have captured two tanks in hand-to-hand combat and destroyed two 15cm mortars. The enemy forces have suffered heavy casualties but are still stubbornly attacking, disregarding their sacrifices. According to U.S. sources, the U.S. 7th Division attacking the Tagami area was trapped in a difficult battle in muddy trenches on the 27th and 28th, and the 96th Division also participated in the attack. The fighting in that area has been extremely intense since the landing. According to a U.S. broadcast on the 30th, the U.S. forces advanced along mountain roads under the cover of machine guns and artillery fire in the Harogato-Leyte Valley line on the 29th. At that time, Japanese forces suddenly emerged from the trenches and launched a daring charge. After six hours of fierce fighting, the U.S. forces were forced to retreat from the mountainous area.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Fight Bravely on Morotai and Peleliu Islands</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – In the Morotai Island area of the Moluccas Islands, after an enemy force of approximately one division landed, the Japanese ground forces on the island immediately launched an interception attack. For the past five weeks, they have been appearing and disappearing unpredictably, using courageous hand-to-hand combat tactics to contain the enemy forces from expanding their territory, and constantly hindering the enemy forces' preparations, airfields, and aircraft formations, engaging in active and brave operations every day, causing the enemy to shiver with fear. However, the enemy is still actively establishing forward bases on Morotai and Peleliu Islands, using them as bases for attacking the Philippines, and advancing the air force and mobile air power of their bases in an attempt to seize air superiority in the Philippine theater of operations. However, the Japanese garrisons on both islands are currently displaying their spirit of resourcefulness and daring to fight, making every effort to contain the enemy's plans in that area, making considerable contributions to the operations in the Philippines. From the time of the enemy's landing until October 25th, the verified total combat results achieved by the Japanese garrison on Morotai Island were as follows: (1) Japanese forces killed or wounded approximately 1,500 enemy soldiers. (2) Enemy weapons destroyed or captured by Japanese forces included two 15cm cannons, one mortar, countless machine guns, artillery vehicles, communication equipment, ammunition, and medical supplies. In addition, 17 enemy headquarters barracks and several concealed fortifications were destroyed.</p>
<h3>East and West Lines of the East Asia Defense are Consolidated</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy U.S. forces gradually invaded westward in the Greater East Asia War, a rather serious situation temporarily emerged, but in the past three weeks, the allied Japanese forces' victory on Taiwan and the sweeping operations in Guangxi have not only completely swept away the sense of unease, but also strengthened our conviction of victory due to the great power displayed by the Japanese forces. Since the enemy U.S. forces successively invaded Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands, and the Philippines last month, attempting to directly attack the coast of mainland China and sever the connection between Japan and the South, the enemy forces have been given a fatal blow through the brave interception by the Japanese forces. Their 58th Mobile Task Force has almost been completely wiped out. Another reason for this adventurous westward invasion by the enemy U.S. forces was that Roosevelt wanted to use it as an election tool, and the Japanese forces were following the plan of luring the enemy deep and launching an offensive to thoroughly destroy the enemy. The terrain of the Philippines is complex, and the Japanese defenses are strong. It is not difficult to imagine that the enemy forces are venturing deep into the Japanese forces' hinterland, throwing themselves into a trap. Although they may try to send reinforcements in the future to relieve the siege, they have fallen into a dilemma due to the difficulty of replenishment. At the same time, the smooth progress of the Japanese operations on the mainland is sufficient to echo the naval battles in the Pacific. As for the mainland front, the Japanese forces have recently swept through key areas in Henan and Hunan, and have even broken into Guangxi. Guilin, its key strategic point, has been heavily surrounded and its fall is imminent. In this way, the Pinghan Line has been opened up, becoming a Great Wall for the defense of the mainland. The U.S. and Chongqing forces are completely powerless in the bases east of the Pingyuehan Line. Thus, looking at the overall situation on both the sea and land fronts, the inner line of defense in Greater East Asia has become extremely strong. Once Guilin falls today, the U.S. air force's power in mainland China will completely collapse. The recent resignation of Stilwell, the U.S. air force commander stationed in Chongqing, due to disagreements with Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing, further shows the anxiety within the enemy. Because the U.S. has suffered losses in both the Pacific and the mainland, it is trying to Americanize the Chongqing army, using the manpower and material resources of the Chongqing side in an attempt to reverse the decline. The viciousness of its conspiracy can be imagined. At this point, we should both grasp the current situation of the war with a calm and collected mind and strive in our respective positions with enthusiastic and excited emotions to win the final victory of the war.</p>
<h3>West African Forces Flee in Burma Border Forest Operations, Japanese Planes Bomb Myitkyina Airfield</h3>
<p>Burma Front, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The enemy's 81st West African Division from the Arakan and Bonseba areas suddenly appeared on the 16th in the Mendo Mountain area between the Kaladan River and the Pi River, attempting to cut off the Japanese forces' rear. On the 22nd and 23rd, Japanese forces launched a preemptive attack, engaging in forest warfare with enemy forces several times their number. The enemy finally fled in disarray towards the Burma-India border, leaving behind 300 bodies and countless mortars and automatic rifles.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a United Press correspondent stationed at the U.S. military headquarters in Chongqing, India, on the 2nd, Japanese planes conducted a night bombing raid on the Myitkyina airfield in northern Burma a few days ago, destroying several U.S. aircraft. Subsequently, several Japanese planes attacked for two consecutive nights, causing U.S. forces to take shelter in air raid bunkers at night.</p>
<h3>Use the Total Strength of East Asian Nations to Win the Final Victory, Broadcast by President Zhou and Minister Lin</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Executive Yuan President Zhou gave a broadcast speech yesterday (the 2nd) at 9:30 PM to commemorate the anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>The friendly relations between China and Japan have indeed been improving at all times in the past four years, but the solid foundation of mutual respect and mutual cooperation has been strengthened by the conclusion of the alliance treaty. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is a concrete manifestation of the determination of China and Japan to fight side by side and unite to defeat Britain and the United States, and it is also a guarantee of China's independence and freedom.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has now entered the final decisive stage. China and Japan, in their allied position, should naturally have further cooperation and further assistance. In the current international situation, the two countries' relationship of shared interests, shared future, and shared destiny is particularly evident. Only by achieving the final victory in the Greater East Asia War can China's rejuvenation, Japan's prosperity, and the liberation of the entire Greater East Asia be achieved. Britain and the United States have not yet abandoned their aggressive designs on East Asia, and their remaining forces are still struggling. The Greater East Asia War cannot be resolved in the short term. We must, of course, continue to fight hard and continue to work hard, using the total strength of all East Asian nations to destroy the remaining power of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has now begun the prelude to the decisive battle. The recent brilliant victories of allied Japan have laid the foundation for victory. The future of East Asian liberation is shining brightly. We believe that by this time next year, the final victory of the Greater East Asia War will definitely be achieved.</p>
<p>Minister Lin Broadcasts</p>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Minister of Propaganda Lin gave a broadcast speech on the 3rd on the theme of the efforts that should be made to commemorate the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, saying that the most important thing to strive for in the current war is to complete the war and ensure victory. The three key points instructed by the Chairman on New Year's Day last year: rectifying thought, ensuring security, and increasing production, are all essential elements for winning the war, and are also the obligations that allied China should fulfill in participating in the war. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has already opened up an equal and free beginning, and we must maintain this beginning and make it progress day by day. Currently, we must strive to achieve the above three points in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. Finally, for the sake of survival and independence, we are engaged in a desperate struggle. First, we must unite the people of the whole country and resolutely oppose the British and American imperialists from using China as a battlefield and scorching China. Second, we must unite all East Asian nations and resolutely oppose the British and American imperialists from having East Asians kill each other. Third, we must awaken all oppressed nations in the world and resolutely oppose the British and American imperialists from dividing the world again.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant General Kusunoki Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Beiping, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to Beiping, Lieutenant General Kusunoki Takataka, met with the press corps for the first time at the ambassador's residence at 4:30 PM on the 2nd and issued a statement, the main points of which are as follows: Currently, the Japanese military has achieved great combat results in defeating Britain and the United States in China and the South Pacific. At the same time, all allied countries in Greater East Asia are contributing their total strength and sincerely cooperating to complete the war. Now, the entire Republic of China is making progress and helping to enhance its combat power, for which Japan is very grateful both officially and privately. This time, I am honored to be appointed as ambassador, and I deeply feel the importance of my mission and am determined to do my best. At the same time, I also firmly believe that the Chinese people will support me in order to meet the expectations of strengthening combat power in North China. No matter how the war situation changes, our determination will never change, and we will not allow any slackening for even a moment. Regarding various policies, the authorities have already made thorough plans, seeking opinions from all aspects in the locality, and officials and civilians will work together to complete the supreme mission entrusted to North China and complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Inside Story</h3>
<p>Recently, the American magazine "Life" published a most interesting report on Chongqing. The author was a special correspondent for "Life" magazine, Serode Whyte, who previously served for five years on Far Eastern issues. We are excerpting this below (1) to understand the inside story of Chongqing, and (2) to recognize the collusion between the enemy Americans and Chongqing, for our readers' reference. Recently, inside the United States, this type of Chongqing criticism, with different approaches but similar themes, has become a trend, but this is one of the most pointed articles.</p>
<p>Local miscellaneous warlords, the traditionalist faction within the Chongqing regime, and the Chinese Communist Party have combined with each other for a common purpose, which in the past must be said to have failed. The constant friction within the Chongqing "War of Resistance" camp also meant that the United States could not avoid a considerable degree of responsibility. Many of the promises made by the United States to the Chongqing regime were not fully realized. The general situation in Chongqing today can be briefly described as blockade, inflation, and political impasse.</p>
<p>The blockade that Chongqing is suffering today is truly rare in modern history. Since the滇緬 Burma Road was blocked by Japan in the spring of 1942, the people of the "War of Resistance Zone" have been completely reliant on their own efforts, self-sufficient and self-sustaining. Before the blockade of the滇緬 Burma Road, China had more than 15,000 trucks, but currently only 5,000 remain, the rest having all become useless objects. The difference between these two figures represents the tragedy of Chongqing. The famines in Henan and Guangdong provinces meant that, without trucks, food relief from various places could not be transported. Starving corpses are everywhere, left for wild dogs to devour, and villagers have no choice but to take risks. As a result, factories are unable to obtain raw materials, which leads to the weakening of the central government's control over the provinces, and the gradual paralysis of domestic trade organizations.</p>
<p>The Chongqing Army looks malnourished</p>
<p>The Chongqing army can only rely on marching on foot. Sometimes, several divisions of troops have to march 2,500 kilometers. Seeing barefooted and malnourished soldiers marching around mountains on rocky and rugged roads, one cannot help but feel miserable. On the front lines, food supplies are completely absent, and soldiers often go without food all day. To obtain food from the people, soldiers sell their military blankets and huddle together at night in the mountains to defend against the cold. I know that one unit lost three-tenths of its entire troop strength during an 800-kilometer march. Among the remaining living soldiers, after examination by American doctors, 15 percent were found to be suffering from lung disease.</p>
<p>In addition, the economic blockade has almost made military production in Chongqing impossible. Even a look at the meager production of bullets will discourage British and American military experts.</p>
<p>Paper Money is Worthless</p>
<p>Chongqing's second major problem is inflation, and taxation has reached saturation. There are no industrial profits to replenish the national treasury. Therefore, Chongqing can only print paper money to support the war. Last year, Chongqing issued four billion yuan in paper money. Perhaps the same amount will have to be issued this year. This unlimited inflation has affected national morality. Corruption among Chinese officials and civilians under the Chongqing regime can be seen everywhere. Paper money has almost completely lost its value, so people no longer value money, nor do they want to save it.</p>
<p>The work of collecting taxes and conscripting young men from farmers is also fraught with darkness. If the relevant authorities can be bribed, young men can avoid conscription. Due to this inflationary situation, a peculiar phenomenon is indeed emerging in the war zone. In other words, strange transactions are taking place in the relatively stable areas of the war zone. These transactions, which involve importing medicines, clothing, and other necessities to Chongqing, are certainly a good thing, but Chongqing soldiers collude with unscrupulous merchants and profiteers to engage in smuggling for profit.</p>
<p>Inflation and economic blockade are all products of war. But the biggest political obstacle within Chongqing is not the issue of war responsibility. It is a true marvel, both ancient and modern, that no one is ever held responsible for Chongqing's defeats. The Kuomintang's implementation of high-pressure tactics within Chongqing is also difficult for those who have not been to Chongqing to imagine. In short, the general public hates the Kuomintang to the bone. Due to the severity of the Kuomintang's censorship system, magazines and newspapers can only publish after-dinner chats and the "official articles" handed down by the government. Major issues such as famine, political arrests, inflation, economic blockade, diplomacy, and important government figures are not allowed to be discussed by the people.</p>
<p>Popular Grievances are Rampant</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek himself certainly has many shortcomings, but he is still the leader of the Chongqing regime, and he is still surrounded by a group of flattering officials. The armies under Chiang Kai-shek's command are often reprimanded by the Allied powers (especially Britain and the United States), and the problem of friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as the problem of famine, are all the most heartbreaking things. Chiang himself does a great deal. Even so, people still have countless grievances against him. The reason why he does not win the hearts of the people is very simple, whether it is due to the issue of in-kind taxation or the issue of farmer conscription. But this extreme dissatisfaction and anger is not dared to be expressed outwardly. Because the Chongqing regime is not a democratic country, they can only dare to be angry but not dare to speak.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations for the Politics of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces</h3>
<p>On the second of this month, the National Government ordered that Chen Qun, the governor of Jiangsu Province, be transferred to the position of President of the Examination Yuan, and that Ren Yuandao succeed him. Not long ago, Fu Shishuo, the governor of Zhejiang Province, was transferred to head the Ministry of Construction, and Xiang Zhengzhuang succeeded him. The sole reason and purpose for the changes of governors in the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the Central District is, naturally, the expectation of a renewal and progress in the politics of the two provinces, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>When Chen Qun succeeded the late Governor Shi Qun of Jiangsu Province in September of last year, we repeatedly discussed the importance of the politics of Jiangsu Province on September 11, 12, and October 4, and offered our humble opinions. Upon re-examining them today, we deeply feel that what we said last year is still needed today, and in reviewing the progress and losses of Jiangsu Province's politics over the past year, we dare not hastily offer words of praise.</p>
<p>The opinions we offered to Jiangsu Province's politics last year were: (1) Central politics and local politics both have a need for innovation. The innovation of local politics should begin with Jiangsu, because Jiangsu Province, in all aspects, whether from a regional, political, economic, educational, or cultural perspective, occupies the most important position among all provinces in the country. From a regional perspective, it is where the capital is located, and the famous Eastern commercial port of Shanghai is also located in this province. From an economic perspective, the Jiangnan region has always been known as a prosperous area. From an educational and cultural perspective, this province is the most culturally rich and educationally developed area. Therefore, the political measures of Jiangsu Province have a model role among all provinces in the country, and also have a mutually supportive relationship with the central government's politics. (2) From now on, Jiangsu Province's politics absolutely needs expert politics and the elimination of bureaucratic politics. The content of modern politics, from decision-making to the execution process, requires the use and handling of scientific thinking at all times and in all places, emphasizing time and striving for efficiency, which is by no means something that bureaucracy, perfunctory handling, can cope with. (3) Start local self-government work as soon as possible, establish public opinion organs, raise the people's awareness of participation in politics, and promote the integration of the government and the people. (4) Abolish local exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, and reduce the burden on farmers.</p>
<p>From the principle that political status quo either advances or retreats, maintaining the status quo is failure. The absence of achievements means that the people's suffering has not been eliminated. The past provincial administration, at most, merely maintained the status quo, and there was no talk of achievements. Now that the governor has been changed, there should naturally be a new spirit. In addition to providing the above opinions, we offer the following views on personnel issues:</p>
<p>(1) The employment of personnel must absolutely adopt the principle of talent. We believe that anyone who cannot employ talent is definitely not a talented person himself; anyone who is a talented person himself will definitely be able to employ talent.</p>
<p>(2) For recommendations and solicitations from all aspects, it is necessary to have the courage to eliminate personal feelings, and completely select people based on merit, not to establish positions based on people.</p>
<p>(3) The county is the basic level of local politics, and the selection of county heads is extremely important. Raise their authority, increase their treatment, and carefully weigh their qualifications and performance.</p>
<p>(4) The first step for local troops must be to avoid disturbing the people, and only then can they maintain law and order. Troops that disturb the people will definitely not be able to protect the people; troops that protect the people will definitely not disturb the people, which is an unchanging principle.</p>
<p>Ren Yuandao is a native of Jiangsu, and Xiang Zhizhuang is a native of Zhejiang. We do not hold regional views and advocate that Jiangsu people govern Jiangsu and Zhejiang people govern Zhejiang, but from the perspective of serving their hometowns and being more familiar with local conditions, we express our earnest expectations for Ren and Xiang. Especially in the current tense decisive battle stage of the Greater East Asia War, we most need to contribute our combat power. At the same time, with the Communist bandits lurking in the peaceful areas, plotting to launch attacks at any time and in any place, it is the most urgent time for local officials to exhaust their efforts and dedicate their lives to the country. We hope that Ren and Xiang, who bear the heavy responsibility of military and political affairs, will seize this good opportunity to serve the country.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army Encircles Guilin City in a Semi-Circle, Fierce Fighting Unfolds at Both North and South Railway Stations</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangxi Front, 3rd Dispatch: The Japanese army is pressing directly on Guilin City and, as of the evening of the 1st, has encircled Guilin City in a semi-circle from the rocky mountain area northwest of the city to the area of General Jiang's Islet (on the right bank of Guilin) (this area is 3 kilometers from Guilin). At this moment, they are actively tightening the encirclement, and have dispatched powerful units to Yanshan Market. Another contingent of the Japanese army, after defeating the 38th Army of the Chongqing forces, has arrived at Ertang Market via the northwest of Gongcheng (location of the 26th Army Headquarters of the Chongqing forces, 18 kilometers east of Pingle). Consequently, the 131st Division, the 170th Division, and a portion of the 79th Army of the 31st Army of the Chongqing forces, which are desperately defending Guilin, are now in a situation akin to being rats in a bag.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 3rd Dispatch: According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing military authorities announced that the Chongqing troops garrisoning Guilin are currently engaged in fierce fighting at both the north and south railway stations. In the northwestern suburbs, it has been impossible to stop the advance of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd Dispatch: According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission issued a war report on the 1st, acknowledging that the Japanese army has advanced on Guilin from the east, west, and northeast. The original dispatch is as follows: 1. The Japanese army has advanced to the Chongqing defensive positions on the outer edges of Guilin. A portion of the Japanese army forcibly crossed the Guijiang River on the 30th and arrived at the North Railway Station north of Guilin City on the 31st. Fierce fighting has now broken out at the North Railway Station. Another unit of the Japanese army crossed the Xiangjiang River at Daxu Town and launched an attack. Fierce fighting is currently underway. Yet another unit is approaching the eastern side of Guilin from Lingshuitang and has arrived near Weibei Village in the suburbs of Guilin (1.5 kilometers from the suburbs of Guilin). Fighting continued until the night of the 31st. 2. The Japanese army, which crossed the Guijiang River to the south from the north, has occupied Lingchuan City. The fighting has now shifted to the south of Lingchuan. Furthermore, the Japanese army, which advanced southwest from Longhu Town, arrived at Gongcheng (35 kilometers northeast of Pingle) at dawn on the 30th, 10 kilometers north of the city. In addition, the Japanese army, which advanced westward from Pingnan in the south, is continuing its attack on Wuxuan.</p>
<p>Encirclement of Pingle Threatens Liuzhou</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 3rd Dispatch: According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, the Japanese army in the Guilin area continues to forcefully attack the vicinity of the North Railway Station in the northwestern suburbs of the city, and fierce fighting is currently underway. The Japanese army has also launched strong attacks four times from the east. Furthermore, other units have launched an attack from a location 19 kilometers south of Guilin, cutting off the retreat route of the Chongqing forces in Guilin. To complete the encirclement of the city, they are also attacking from a location 69 kilometers south of Guilin, and fierce fighting has broken out. A separate unit of the Japanese army is attempting to reach the South Railway Station of the city, and the Chongqing forces are currently exerting all their efforts to resist. In addition, the Japanese army, which advanced from the northeast of Guilin, has encircled and is attacking Pingle, a vital transportation hub more than 80 kilometers southeast of the city. The Japanese army may threaten Liuzhou from this location. Furthermore, the Japanese army is now launching an attack southeastward from Fuchuan, 35 kilometers southeast of Guilin. This unit appears to be attempting to connect with the Japanese army on the Xijiang River front and has already advanced to a location 20 kilometers away.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry Plans to Establish a Liaison Office in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch: The Ministry of Industry, in the face of the current decisive battle system, is sparing no effort to increase production and assist the war effort. Therefore, this spring, it dispatched five members, including You Yizhao and Hu Aiqiao, to Shanghai to supervise and guide various factories, so as to dare to take the effect of liaison, and can also add to solve the problem of various factory master dynamic raw materials. Since the members have gone to Shanghai to supervise and guide since then, in a flash it has been six months, the achievement is quite good. In order to continue to maintain contact with and manage the various factories in Shanghai, the ministry plans to establish a liaison office of the ministry's Industrial Department in Shanghai this month. The organization of this institution is currently being actively organized, and once it is ready, it will officially begin work.</p>
<h3>Second Day of the Security Conference, Continues to Review Proposals, Telegram of Respect Sent to Chairman Wang</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch: The first National Security Conference was held for the second day on the 3rd, still continuing at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association. At 9:00 AM, the chairman of the conference, Li Xuanti, and two other representatives paid their respects to Chairman Wang of the National Government, the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, the President of the Executive Yuan, and various related agencies of allied nations. At 10:10 AM, Army Minister Ye Peng gave a business lecture, the topic of which was "Deliberations on Strengthening the Security Forces," lasting for more than an hour.

<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch: Yesterday (3rd), at the National Security Conference, a temporary motion was proposed by a representative of the Ministry of the Army to send a telegram of respect to Chairman Wang of the National Government, which was unanimously approved on the spot.</p>
<h3>Deep Expectations for Ren Yuandao as Governor of Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Suzhou, 3rd Dispatch: At the 141st meeting of the Central Consultative Council, Chen Qun of Jiangsu Province was approved as President of the Examination Yuan. All sectors of the province expressed deep regret because Governor Chen had been in charge of Jiangsu for more than a year and had achieved a good political reputation. At the same time, Ren Yuandao taking over as governor of Jiangsu was universally welcomed. It is generally believed that the new Governor Ren has long served as the Commander-in-Chief of the First Front Army, and the units under his command are mostly stationed in various key locations in Jiangsu Province, shouldering the responsibility of defending the local area. This time, Ren concurrently serves as the Pacification Commissioner while being the governor, so in the future, the operation of both the military and political sides will certainly be able to exert its effectiveness even more. Therefore, in Jiangsu Province, the birthplace of the countryside clearing, the countryside clearing work will also have a more rapid progress. Moreover, with the guarantee of security, the work of increasing production can also be smoothly promoted. Therefore, the people of Jiangsu Province have deep expectations for the promotion of the unification of military and political policies after the new Governor Ren takes office.</p>
<h3>Nelson to Visit Chongqing Again</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 3rd Dispatch: According to the German News Agency, Washington news: Former Director of the US War Production Board, Nelson, will return to Chongqing again to assist the Chongqing side in reorganizing its war efforts, and will assist the Chongqing side in establishing a wartime production board.</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Actively Prepares to Deal with the Communists</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 3rd Dispatch: Since Stilwell's return to the country, the conflict between Chongqing and the United States has intensified. British and American news agencies have seized the opportunity to launch a major attack on the Chongqing side. A Reuters New Delhi correspondent reported on the 31st that the US government is not satisfied with its cooperation with Chongqing. Therefore, Roosevelt has specially dispatched Nelson and Hurley to Chongqing to discuss the issue of Chongqing's cooperation in the fight against the Axis forces. Chiang Kai-shek reluctantly accepted the US demands, but for the sake of appearances, he asked Roosevelt to recall General Stilwell, and gave many reasons for the blame. The US side said that Stilwell's return to the country this time, and the reasons listed by Chiang, could not be announced due to military secrets. However, in view of the facts, the internal division of the Chongqing regime in the past few years has been very large. The United States did not announce it, believing that there were two reasons: first, Chongqing adopted a censorship system, and second, it believed that the chaos in Chongqing would soon return to its original state. However, this kind of chaos increased day by day, and finally led to Stilwell's recall. According to those who came to New Delhi from Chongqing last spring, the weapons and lend-lease goods imported from the United States to Chongqing were not used for the war against Japan. Chongqing prepared to engage in a civil war, so all of them were collected. Now, a million Chongqing troops are deployed in northern China to guard against the Communist Party. Therefore, the Chongqing army only nominally resists the Japanese army in various battlefields, while the powerful figures in the Chongqing regime manipulate the financial foreign exchange market and enrich their own pockets. We reporters know this situation very well, but in the past, we could not report this kind of news at will. As for the Kuomintang regime led by Chiang Kai-shek, it believes that the inevitable civil war in the future is more important than the war against Japan, and is always prepared to prevent 800,000 Chinese Communists. I have served in the China-Burma-India front for about two years, and I know very well that Chiang's current task is to fight against the Chinese Communist Party. There is no democracy in Chongqing, and there is still no perfect dictatorship. If the Kuomintang regime says that there is no freedom of speech in Chongqing, it is not an exaggeration.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt's Campaign Speech</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 3rd Dispatch: According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington: President Roosevelt delivered a campaign broadcast speech from the White House. The content did not strictly refute Dewey's attacks on him, but focused on military and political issues. He said that the progress of the war and the organization of peace are still proceeding along the original path. Only in this way can the war be ended quickly and the sacrifice of manpower and materials be reduced. The United States should take the leading position in the work of peace building. If we allow the Republican Party to turn peace into a partisan dispute, then both large and small countries will be disappointed.</p>
<h3>Battle for the Hungarian Capital Unfolds with Tank Warfare, Soviet Offensive Intensifies on the Slovak Border</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 3rd Dispatch: Between the rivers south of Budapest, the German and Soviet armies have concentrated their main forces in the 特勃萊森 Tebleissen area and are engaged in a major tank battle. Furthermore, the highway between the Nagykoros district Cegled and 開赤開美特 Kecskemet seems to have been cut off, and the battle to capture Budapest has entered a critical situation that is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 3rd Dispatch: According to a Reuters dispatch: The battle of 奥资 Aozi and 普莱斯柯林—伐诺特 Plesscolin-Fanot on the Eastern Front reached its peak on the 6th. The enemy's reinforcements in the entire area from 杜柯姆 Dukum to 里巴 Riba continued to attack fiercely, but they still failed to break through. The battle on the Slovak border revealed the enemy's ambition to seize eastern Slovakia. The enemy's flanking actions west of the Dukla Pass and around Ingvar have become increasingly apparent. The German army continued to disengage in the central part of the 蓝河 Blue River, unhindered by the enemy, and occupied favorable positions south of the Slovak border. There was fierce fighting between the Danube and the Tisa rivers. The enemy launched a fierce attack from the索尔诺克—巴雅 Solnok-Baja area, aiming at Budapest, which caused a tank war to break out.</p>
<p>German Troops in Greece Retreating North</p>
<p>German troops in Greece continued to retreat, abandoning Salonica in order to assist in the battle in Hungary. The Red Army and guerrillas in Croatia attempted to obstruct them. Therefore, the German army had to clear the highway and railway line from Salonica to Belgrade. At present, the German troops in various parts of Southeast Europe are concentrating, so their strength has become increasingly strong.</p>
<h3>Molotov Will Be Stalin's Successor</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 3rd Dispatch: According to the German News Agency, Moscow news from the Associated Press: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has recently undergone major changes. He used to dislike alcohol, but now he likes it. He is particularly cautious and respectful in front of Stalin. Whenever Stalin gives instructions, Molotov must rush to carry them out. Molotov's political position has recently become very stable. People in Moscow believe that if Stalin dies, the person appointed as leader will definitely be Molotov.</p>
<h3>German Troops Fight Hard to Block the Enemy in the Lower Reaches of the Meuse River, Isolated Troops on Walcheren Island Continue to Resist</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 3rd Dispatch: According to a Reuters dispatch: In northwestern Brabant, the anti-Axis forces continue to exert strong pressure on the last defensive positions of the German army south of 荷兰许狄普 Netherlands' Xidipp and in the lower reaches of the Meuse River. However, General Montgomery could not quickly occupy the bridges of 摩尔狄杰克 Moerdijk, 莱姆唐克维尔 Leim Tonkville and 凯士维尔 Kersville, and had the ability to prevent the German 15th Army from retreating between the Meuse and Waal rivers. Therefore, he had to concentrate his troops to cross the river. However, there is still a German bridgehead south of the river. The defense of the Meuse River bridgehead by the German army is quite active. Therefore, the future of the British and Canadian forces' frontal attack on 荷兰许狄普及 Netherlands' Xidipp and the lower reaches of the Meuse River is still not bright. Therefore, General Montgomery can only break through westward from the Nijmegen bridgehead, or use a large number of airborne troops to fight in the rear. Although the current situation is relatively unimportant, the number of anti-Axis forces restrained is very large. At present, the enemy army has entered the弗勒欣 Floshin River and its port, but the port has been completely destroyed. The German defenders of Walcheren Island, although subjected to the pressure of superior enemy forces, continue to resist with the fighting spirit of the German defenders in Saint-Malo, Calais, and other places.</p>
<h3>Germany's Belief in Victory Will Never Waver</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 3rd Dispatch: According to a Reuters dispatch, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in the latest issue of the German Weekly that so far, the war has not been won or lost. Only the last battle can determine the outcome. The leaders of the countries that surrendered to Bolshevism all came from the bourgeoisie and did not gain the trust and support of their people. Therefore, they were unable to stop the spiritual collapse of their people. The most determined country can win because it is willing to sacrifice everything for the doctrine it is fighting for. Germany is this kind of country. Therefore, victory and defeat are both in its hands, and it is free to choose.</p>
<h3>Churchill and Eden to Visit Paris, French General Denz is Arrested</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 3rd Dispatch: According to a Reuters dispatch, the Paris radio station said that the French Provisional Government announced last night that British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden will visit Paris soon. Subsequently, Reuters announced from London that Churchill has accepted de Gaulle's invitation to visit Paris. The date of Churchill's visit is still to be negotiated.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Basel, 3rd Dispatch: According to a Reuters dispatch, Catholic figures in Chiasso said that British Foreign Secretary Eden may have visited the Pope, but it is not yet known. Eden will report the results of the Moscow conference to the Pope and discuss the status of Catholicism in Poland and Hungary with the Pope. Eden may mention the issue of upgrading the British Embassy to the Holy See to an embassy, but he is currently keeping silent.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Madrid, 3rd Dispatch: According to the German News Agency, General Denz, who signed the Paris surrender agreement in June 1940, has been arrested by the de Gaulle authorities in Grenoble and will reportedly be tried in Paris.</p>
<h3>Negotiations to Unfreeze French Funds in the US</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Geneva, 3rd Dispatch: According to the German News Agency, the US and the French regime will soon negotiate the release of frozen French funds in the US. These funds are worth about 140 million yuan. After the de Gaulle Committee was recognized as the French Provisional Government, the funds should have been unfrozen. Now a special negotiation must be held to resolve this issue, indicating that the United States has other conditions to offer.</p>
<h3>Fascist Italian Troops Join the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency reports: The British Eighth Army has launched an offensive towards the northwest and west in the Adriatic Sea region. Anti-Axis forces have concentrated at Ronco, with the left wing preparing to attack Forli and the right wing aiming for Ravenna. The Anti-Axis forces are likely to focus on the left wing, launching a new offensive using the main roads of the Po River plain. It is particularly noteworthy that Italian Fascist troops have joined the battle in the Castelnuovo area (Castelnuovo, along the coast of De Guri An). The majority of these troops were trained in Germany and are equipped with the latest German weaponry.</p>
<h3>Former Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Bern, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Sofia news: Former Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov committed suicide in a hospital in Sofia. Prior to his death, a foreign diplomat had visited him. Popov served as Foreign Minister in the Filov Cabinet, which declared war on Britain and the United States in 1941.

<h3>Soviet Union Accuses Romanian Government of Violating Armistice Agreement</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a Moscow dispatch, the Soviet government issued a statement through TASS, strongly criticizing the Romanian government for violating the terms of the armistice agreement. The gist of the statement is that during the war, Romanian troops transported a large number of machines from Okerland and Bessarabia. The armistice conditions stipulated the return of these looted machines, but the Romanian government concealed the facts and refused to return them. The armistice conditions also stipulated the purging of state organs, which the Romanian government also delayed implementing. Although Romania has arrested 500 Fascist party members responsible for the war, members of the Iron Guard faction still occupy important positions in state organs, engaging in anti-Soviet activities.</p>
<h3>Pro-Soviet Elements in Finland Organize New Political Party</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency reports: The Finnish Radical Socialist Party was recently established in Helsinki. The initiator is Han Huineng, a newcomer in politics. The party sent a letter to the Finnish government, requesting the strengthening of Finnish-Soviet relations.</p>
<h3>De Valera Doubts World Security Plan</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency reports: Irish Free State Prime Minister De Valera, in a speech at Trinity College in Dublin yesterday, expressed doubts about the Allied nations' world security plan. It is said that the failure of the League of Nations was because the major powers, after the establishment of the League, acted independently and were unwilling to cooperate with other countries. It is expected that a truly peace-guaranteeing organization cannot be created in the foreseeable future.</p>

<h3>Police Bureau Cracks Down on Flammable and Explosive Hazardous Materials to Maintain Order and Prevent Unfortunate Incidents</h3>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the crackdown on flammable and explosive hazardous materials, the police authorities issued the following statement:</p>
<p>As per the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau's announcement today, starting from November 6th (Monday), a crackdown on flammable and explosive hazardous materials will be implemented. Regarding hazardous materials, it is normally necessary to seriously crack down on them to maintain public order, and especially during wartime, they should be thoroughly cracked down on. Now that enemy planes are repeatedly attacking the Shanghai area, in order to complete the air defense work and prevent unfortunate incidents caused by explosive and flammable hazardous materials, it is a natural countermeasure to implement this crackdown measure. The purpose of the crackdown, as mentioned earlier, is to ensure the security of the city, not to carry out compulsory purchase. However, based on the results of the investigation, depending on the storage location, the structure of the storage place, and the amount of storage, the dangerous items may be ordered to be moved or dispersed in order to prevent dangerous incidents from occurring in emergencies. We hope that all sectors will understand this point.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those who own or are entrusted with the care of the hazardous materials specified in the announcement should, regardless of the quantity or their occupation, obtain an application form from the nearest economic police team under the Economic Security Office within the specified period and complete the registration. The registration procedure is the same as in the past.</p>
<p>This crackdown is different from general commodity registration. Those who fail to register will be severely punished according to the law, and the stored hazardous materials will be confiscated. Please refer to the announcement and do not violate it.</p>
<h3>Director Gu of the Baojia Office Talks About Improving Baojia Administration at Yesterday's Regular Press Conference</h3>
<p>Gu Jiwu, director of the Baojia Office of the Shanghai Police Bureau, attended the 26th regular press conference of the Municipal Government Propaganda Office at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 3rd), met with reporters from various newspapers in the city. Liang Xiuyu, director of the Propaganda Office, also arrived on time with Secretary Pan Bide. Director Liang delivered a speech, followed by Director Gu answering the questions raised by reporters in detail until 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Obtaining Forms is Free (1) The Baojia shares of various branches in the city sometimes claim that the superiors have not yet issued them when citizens go to purchase movement certificates, and temporarily refuse to sell them, resulting in delays of several weeks. Has the Baojia Office heard anything about this matter, and what remedies are available if it is discovered again in the future? (Answer) Regarding the issue of requesting movement certificates, before June of this year, the request for movement certificates and reports had already been subject to a fee, which was directly submitted by the branches to the Baojia Office and then transferred to the Accounting Office of the First District Office. Since the merger of police administration in the city after June, the fee for various forms in the branches has been collected by the General Affairs Office and then transferred to the Municipal Government General Accounting Office. As for the situation of lack of application forms two weeks ago, the matter has passed. Initially, due to budget reasons, there were some delays in printing, which caused a lot of rumors. Later, this office immediately sought remedial measures to meet the urgent needs, and first raised funds for printing, which were successively allocated to various district branches to meet the needs of citizens. Therefore, in terms of supply, there should be no problems. Originally, the regulations for charging fees for applications for movement, birth, death, etc., require residents to pay the prescribed handling fee and issue a receipt after completing the procedures. It is not necessary to pay when requesting the form in the first place. If there are any corrupt practices in various places, this office will definitely issue a notice to investigate and ensure that they are eradicated.</p>
<p>Plans to Improve the Organization of Self-Defense (2) The Winter Defense issue is more important than before. Does the Baojia Office have any predetermined plans on how to assist the Baojia Self-Defense Corps in Winter Defense work? (Answer) As the beginning of winter approaches, measures for winter defense are extremely important. The Self-Defense Corps Headquarters also feels deeply about this. Since its establishment on September 9th of this year, the Self-Defense Corps Headquarters has been actively investigating the work of Self-Defense Corps members who are serving or exempt from service. All men aged 18 to 45 must be investigated one by one. This work has not yet been completed. After it is completed, those who are exempt from service will be sorted out separately. The past Self-Defense Corps was based on each branch as a unit, and there was a lack of joint defense. In order to establish a concrete plan for the people's self-defense, it is necessary to conduct a widespread investigation to avoid the drawbacks of each serving in the same post, and to correct the appearance. After the investigation of the Self-Defense Corps members in each district is completed, the Headquarters will give them a concrete organization, which includes three types: (1) Establishing model members, targeting knowledgeable youths, to cultivate self-defense and air defense instructors, and serving in each district. The selection of model members is borne by the knowledgeable youths in each district. (2) Establishing basic members, planning to select strong and healthy people for training in major stores, factories, schools, and families with large populations in the city, with the principle of more service, and providing them with living benefits. Unemployed youths and youths who have not yet been employed should also be organized into basic members. In short, basic members who have basic knowledge can participate to strengthen the basic lineup. (3) The establishment of reserve members is to consider the convenience of the general managers of major companies, banks, money shops, and shopkeepers. Because of their position and business, they feel inconvenienced in fact, and they are responsible for internal affairs and economics, with the principle of assisting the locality. Therefore, the organization of reserve members is carefully reviewed. The general ordinary corps members are the self-defense corps members who serve and patrol at ordinary times. In the future, the organization of members and the expenditure of various expenses have been greatly improved compared to July and August, which is more convenient.</p>
<p>Supervise Branches to Improve Services (3) Citizens apply for residence permits. Although the Baojia authorities have repeatedly ordered police station staff to provide citizens with various conveniences, in fact it is still very troublesome, especially for illiterate people. They often ask people to fill in their names, ages, and continuations, which are often inconsistent, and they often have to go back and forth again and again, and still cannot get them. It is hoped that the Baojia Office will seek to improve this as soon as possible, or order the police station staff to provide detailed guidance.</p>
<p>(Answer) This office specializes in Baojia work, with the principle of serving the people, which is the work between the people and the police. All levels of Baojia organizations are folk organizations, while the Baojia shares of various branches are police station organizations. When this office is implementing Baojia administration, the police station distributes orders to the various shares, and the personnel of the various shares are selected by the General Affairs Office of the police station. As for the corrupt practices, the Inspectorate is responsible for them, while this office provides instructions and commands on the matters in charge. Recently, Director Chen has stipulated that the various shares of the various branches should be closely linked in terms of affairs by the competent offices. Therefore, this office will closely supervise the contact and command of the Baojia shares of the various branches in the future, and its work will be improved, and the responsibility of this office will definitely be worthy of the expectations of you and the residents of the districts under your jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Inspection of Gold Begins to Strengthen Financial Institutions and Increase the Review of Loans</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank's Financial Business Inspection Office, entrusted with strengthening the business of financial institutions in Shanghai, has drafted implementation guidelines in accordance with the provisions of the strengthening outline promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and notified the various financial institutions to comply with them. Financial institutions whose daily deposit amount is less than the prescribed amount must go through the procedures for increasing capital or merging and reorganizing before March 21, 1945, otherwise they will be ordered to suspend business according to law if they exceed the time limit. As for loan business, it must be applied for and approved before it can be undertaken. In order to strictly handle the review of applications for loans from financial institutions, an audit section has been added under the review team, which is responsible for handling the application for approval of loan business from various financial institutions, and carefully inspecting the 30% deposit payment reserve. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry, more than 70% of the financial institutions in the city need to go through the procedures for increasing capital. Because the Ministry of Finance stipulates a five-month time limit for increasing capital, the various financial institutions can prepare to enrich their organization.</p>
<h3>Overtime Business Will Be Permanently Suspended from Electricity Supply and Several Stores Have Been Fined</h3>
<p>In order to control electricity consumption, the municipal authorities limit the business hours of various industries. Ordinary stores and various stalls must close at 7:00 PM, entertainment venues must close at 10:00 PM every night, and all lights must be turned off at 11:00 PM. Residents must turn off all lights after 12:00 PM. However, it has been found that there are still those who despise the law and do not comply with the specified time, especially in the Old Zhabei and Taishan districts of Huangpu, where entertainment venues are concentrated. The various branches have been strictly supervised and managed, ordering various stores and entertainment venues and other special businesses to strictly comply. Those who violate it for the first time will be warned, and those who violate it again will have their electricity supply suspended according to the regulations and will never be restored. A number of stores and entertainment venues have been subjected to this power outage penalty.</p>
<h3>Business Directory Extends Its Publication Announcement</h3>

<h3>Major Shioda Expresses the Japanese Army's Conviction of Victory and Determination to Annihilate the British and American Fleets</h3>
<p>The Allied land, sea, and air news authorities jointly met with the Shanghai Chinese Newspaper Reporters' Association at the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 3rd). Major Shioda of the Fleet News Department expressed the Japanese fleet's determination to annihilate the British and American fleets in the Pacific. The record of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Painfully Strike the Remaining Enemy Fleet Since October 12th to November 2nd, an average of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters war report has been released every day, and every time it is released, the Japanese army has achieved major war results. Therefore, the enemy's Pacific Fleet has been almost completely wiped out. However, we are still not satisfied with this great war result. We must completely destroy the enemy's Pacific Fleet and the British Fleet in the Indian Ocean, because their existence is an obstacle to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. The Combined Fleet is now waiting for an opportunity to wipe out the enemy in one fell swoop. Another part of the Combined Fleet is pursuing the remaining enemy forces in the seas east of Leyte and the Philippines. This first operation has ended, and we are preparing for the second operation. If the remaining enemy American and British fleets can exist, it will prolong the Greater East Asia War. At present, we predict that the enemy still has several battleships and three or four aircraft carriers remaining.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops on Leyte Are Besieged on All Sides The enemy intends to establish an air base on Leyte, using New Guinea, Hawaii, and other places as a supply of air power, but the remaining one or two aircraft carriers are likely to be annihilated in one or two days. Although the enemy has increased a division of troops on Leyte (the enemy now has five divisions of troops on Leyte), all sides are blocked and besieged on all sides, and they are extremely uneasy. On the contrary, the right to control the sea and the air is now in the hands of Japan, and the enemy has no way to reverse the decline.</p>
<p>Strengthen Unity and Protect East Asia Together At present, the center will shift from the Philippines to Morotai and Peleliu, because the Japanese forces are not attacking the Philippines alone, but attacking Morotai and Peleliu separately, which indicates that the Japanese offensive has changed. The US presidential election period is approaching day by day, and Roosevelt is extremely anxious about this. Therefore, the enemy will inevitably carry out air raids on Japan using the air force in the Saipan and mainland China areas, which is really expected. On the anniversary of the Greater East Asia Declaration, we should work harder together and allow to strengthen the unity of the countries of Greater East Asia, so that any difficulties can be overcome.</p>
<h3>Conversation with Japanese Christian Leader Kagawa</h3>
<p>Kagawa Toyohiko, a well-known national Japanese Christian leader, stated when he met with reporters yesterday: Only through international cooperation in the economic, social, scientific, political, and educational spheres can permanent peace be maintained. Japan has a cooperative system in all aspects of life, so even if it lasts for 30 centuries, the United States will not be able to conquer Japan. This also proves that world cooperation can maintain permanent peace. It is foolish for the United States to want to restore the League of Nations after the war. The first League of Nations failed because it completely omitted the factor of economic cooperation, and the second League of Nations will also fail for the same reason, which is very obvious. Japan's resources are not as good as those of the United States, but because of its economic cooperation system, it has been able to fight for three years, making it impossible for the United States to conquer Japan. It is also wrong for the United States to think that Japan is backward in science. Japan has made great achievements in heavy industry. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, many people did not understand Japan's heart to fight for the liberation of East Asia, but since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, it has evolved into a war to liberate the nations of East Asia. Even if the European War ends, Japan will continue to fight to liberate East Asia. Roosevelt and Churchill have failed to practice Christian doctrine, and Japanese Christians are deeply ashamed of this.</p>

<h3>Police Bureau Strictly Cracks Down on "Black Hat Racket" at Train Station, Sends Plainclothes Officers to Station for Investigation</h3>
<p>The Xihongkou Branch of the City Police Bureau, which is in charge of the police affairs of the North Railway Station, has recently received confidential reports that "black hats" often cause trouble for passengers, or fraudulently demand money under the pretext of checking whether tickets were purchased from the black market, or even refuse ticket-holding passengers to board the train under the pretext that the train is full. The police authorities are very indignant about this situation. Director Sun of the branch ordered his subordinates to go to the station in plain clothes to investigate. If there are any of the above-mentioned illegal acts, they will be cracked down on. If passengers encounter extortion or fraud, they can report to the patrolling police, or note the name on the left chest of the "black hat" and report it to the branch.</p>
<h3>Reply Again</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of the living subsidies for teachers and staff collected by this newspaper on behalf of Mr. Xu Chengqing and others on August 13, we have received another letter from Mr. Xu and others. We will reply again as follows: After the original collection of subsidies by this newspaper ended, we repeatedly requested that it be transferred to the authorities. The authorities then asked us to keep it temporarily. At that time, the Police Consumers' Cooperative went to Wuhu to buy rice, so we entrusted them to buy it. Later, because some people in the cooperative could not agree to it, the matter was abandoned. This newspaper then repeatedly sent letters to the Education Bureau to transfer the funds. On September 29, the Education Bureau sent someone to pick up the funds, totaling 1,032,500 yuan. After that, sporadic donations were transferred as soon as they arrived. Please supervise. - Shen Bao Newspaper Office</p>

<p>National Forum</p>
<h3>Opinions on Rectifying Abuses at Four Stations</h3>
<p>— Han Ruo</p>
<p>Because of the reduction in train schedules and carriages, the average traveler sees train travel as a path of thorns. The difficulty in purchasing tickets, the arbitrary and overbearing behavior of station and train staff, and extortion are unprecedented even during wartime. These past occurrences are frequently seen. The highest authorities of China Railway (Hua Tie) are determined to rectify the situation, and the general public eagerly awaits reforms. However, concrete and effective methods of rectification and reform have yet to be implemented, and travelers continue to be exploited as before. Indeed, this is intensifying. A crucial national transportation system is controlled by a few unscrupulous individuals who use it as a tool for personal gain, while the responsible authorities are unable to rectify or eliminate this, allowing these bad practices to spread. I believe China Railway and the Ministry of Construction are hardly blameless.</p>
<p>Currently, travelers find three issues most troublesome: (1) difficulty in purchasing tickets, (2) difficulty in entering the station and boarding the train even with a ticket, and (3) being harassed by train staff even if one manages to board. If we calmly examine the three sufferings endured by travelers, the railway authorities have more difficulty handling the first issue. The other two issues are personnel management problems for the railway bureau, and outsiders can hardly intervene. Regarding the first issue, the difficulty in buying tickets is due to the current wartime conditions, which has reduced the supply of railway materials and made the manufacture of carriages and locomotives difficult. Simultaneously, military transport and the shipment of goods take precedence over passenger transport. As a result, carriages and schedules have decreased, while the number of travelers has not decreased but increased. This leads to a state of supply falling short of demand. With many needing it and few supplying it, the value naturally increases. This is an irrefutable economic principle that can be attributed to environmental circumstances, and neither the travelers nor the railway authorities are at fault. However, for the second and third issues, the railway bureau seems to bear full responsibility for the unreasonable oppression suffered by travelers. A traveler who has purchased a ticket has already acquired the right to board the train. If the ticket is not a forgery, even if purchased on the black market, the passenger should be allowed to board. However, ticket examiners at the entrance deliberately make things difficult for passengers and extort money. Station staff maintaining order abuse passengers, forcibly check identification, and extort money on various pretexts, and so on. After managing to pass through the entrance, boarding the train also requires enduring abuse from train staff, who block the door, push, obstruct, scold, and demand bribes in every possible way, preying on the weak. One cannot board unless one satisfies their desires.</p>
<p>We believe that the railway authorities should bear full responsibility for all disturbances from the entrance to the destination, except for matters related to police affairs. This is due to the poor personnel management and inadequate service education of the railway bureau. Only by introspecting, restraining oneself, strengthening personnel management, and vigorously implementing service education can travelers be spared unnecessary suffering. Therefore, we would like to offer the following points to the railway authorities for reference:</p>
<p>(1) Rationalize the living conditions and treatment of employees: The authorities should first pay attention to whether the provision of living expenses for employees is reasonable. The railway bureau should first understand the living conditions of its employees and then adjust them to be rational.</p>
<p>(2) Strengthen personnel management: Pay special attention to strict performance evaluations and the implementation of rewards and punishments. In addition, revise and refine service regulations, and continuously promote service education to improve the service ethics of railway employees.</p>
<p>(3) Supervisory system: The supervisory system occupies an important position in police administration. Diligent and devoted supervisors who prevent collusion are very effective. If the railway administration has such an organization, it should be strengthened. If it has not been established, it may as well be established to rigorously supervise and inspect service employees so that those who neglect their duties have something to fear.</p>
<p>(4) Reward the reporting of misconduct: The railway bureau should post notices prominently in stations and on trains, indicating not only the procedures that passengers should follow, but also specifying where those who have been harassed can report and be rewarded so that passengers are happy to report any illegal mistreatment they receive.</p>
<p>We believe that the above four points address both the symptoms and the root causes. If the railway authorities resolutely implement them with a spirit of introspection and self-discipline, the benefits to travelers will be significant.</p>

<h3>Philanthropist Zhang Generously Donates to Aid the Old Age Home</h3>
<p>Target: 5,000,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Period: November 10th</p>
<p>Collection Point: Social Services Department of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Since this newspaper issued a call for help to the Shanghai Old Age Home, asking the public for relief, people from all walks of life have sympathized with the orphans and the needy, generously donating and resonating with compassion day after day. Yesterday, Mr. Chen Hongquan again solicited from philanthropist Zhang, who generously donated 162,777 yuan in response. This truly embodies the spirit of sharing their pain and regarding all as brothers.</p>
<p>Shouyi Transferred to Old Age Home Funding: Wang Huanzhao and Wang Huanwen write in a letter, "Dear Sirs, our mother's 70th birthday this year was initially celebrated only with a family celebration in the first month, as we were instructed not to be extravagant due to the extraordinary times. Subsequently, on October 10th, we stayed briefly in Xishan for a wedding banquet for our relatives. We were then showered with generous gifts from some local relatives and friends, who felt that our mother was reaching the age of seventy and could not go without a birthday celebration. We brothers reluctantly enjoyed the celebration for one day. Now, we are specially donating the 13,200 yuan of birthday money received that day, along with the gown fabrics and cake, peach, candle, and noodle gifts from relatives and friends, valued at 10,000 yuan, totaling 23,200 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, for the Shanghai Old Age Home's expenses, as a blessing from our relatives and friends."</p>
