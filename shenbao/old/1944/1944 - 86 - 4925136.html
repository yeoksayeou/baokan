<h3>慶祝國府還都紀念</h3>
<p>光陰易逝，國府還都迄今，巳歷四載。今天適逢紀念之日，飲水思源，回想國府還都以前，奔走和運，不避鋒鏑之士，表示無限敬意。汪至席暨一部分國民黨同志个辭艱危，倡導和運，締造今日局面，也極仰佩。今天已是第四度慶祝還都紀念了，我們閉目以思，感覺値得慶祝者，惟有和運政策的正確性，歷久愈眞。當四年以前，創導和運之始，暨還都以後之短時期內，大部分人對於和運政策，不僅未會瞭解，且視為異數。歷經艱辛奮　，逐漸樹立對外對內的基礎，向之未能瞭解和運政策者，逐漸移轉觀念。迨日木實踐對華新政策後，更逐漸認識而接受和平政策。有了和平運動的努力，才有日本對華新政策的實踐，才有大東亞民族共同抵禦外敵的齊一陣綫。</p>
<p>然而，國民政府還都之日，就是擔負重大使命的開始之時，以迄於今，使命一日未完成，責任一日未可卸。重大的使命是什麼呢？第一，是改善民生。本報三十二年一月二十七日社評中說：「凡重慶方面對於國家與人民之利益，所不能解決之問題，主要者，凡重慶方面所言所行而已經失敗者，國民自從去年春，日本宣布對華新政策後，逐漸實踐，顯著者如交還租界，撤廢治外法權，發還敵產，協助經濟統制，強化國民政府。日本雖能具體實踐，可是，能否取得中國人民的瞭解，以及瞭解的深刻至如何程度，還在於國民政府的政治能否配合為先決。如果國府政治未能配合日本實踐新政策的步驟，那末，人民因為不瞭解國府政治，而同時不瞭解日本對華新政策，不無關係。如今四年了，這兩個重大使命，究竟完成了沒有？或者完成到何種地步？今天我們一方面慶祝，一方面還應切切實實的加以反省！</p>
<p>什麼是國民政府的政治能否配合的先決呢？就是我們一貫主張的「革新政治」。而革新政治的前提，一是建立專家政治，二是建立民意機構。專家政治包括好人政府，廉潔政治。於是，一方面淘汰食汚，澄淸吏治，建設好人政府，樹立康潔政治；一方面厲行考試與銓叙制度，採取用人唯才主義，廻避用人唯親唯私觀念，建立專家政治。其次，國家政治上的不合理現象，在政府當政者，主觀上或許是「當局者混」，可是，人民在客觀上却是「旁觀者淸」。所以，建立了民意機關，人民可以就淸楚的客觀，指陳得失，矯正不合理現象。</p>
<p>今天欣逢國府還都四周紀念之日，我們謹以至誠，重復提出「革新政治」四字，以為慶祝的獻禮。到了明年今日，國府還都五周紀念的時候，希望能在事實上，完成革新政治，同時完成上述的兩個重大使命！</p>
<h3>密芝那西北地區日軍展開邀擊戰　中路向伊姆法爾平原進攻</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電日大本營二十入日下午五時二十分發表緬甸方面戰况如次：　細甸北部日軍，刻在密芝那西北方地區，邀擊由當貢地區侵人之渝軍新編第一軍兩師及英。美聯合軍約兩旅團，並對在加薩附近地區降落之敵空軍輸送部隊壓縮包圍圈中。　印細中部國境之日軍，刻在琴丘陸及加飽溪谷附近，繼續攻擊被包國之英印軍第四軍團主力，並以主力向伊姆法爾平原進攻中，　印緬國境之日軍，於殲滅英印軍第七師團主力以後，更對進抵該方面之英印軍第十五軍團主力，加以反擎。同時，並攻擊加拉頓河谷區西面之第八十一師團，戰事之進展，極為順利。</p>
<p>仰光二十九日中央社電日陸軍戰鬥機編隊，會於二十六日攻擊在摩尼伉路東方降下敵空輸挺進隊，敵部隊已為日陸上部隊包圍，日戰鬥機隊則對之猛烈射舉，並於同時空襲敵機塲，將正在着陸中之敵小型運輪機五十五架完全炸毀，日機刻已安返基地。</p>
<p>仰光二十九日中央社電緬甸方面日陸機隊精銳，呼應北部緬印國境之日軍，二十六日堂堂出動，對敗走頓扎恩北方為日印軍包圍正頑強抵抗之英第十七師團殘敵，反覆作超低空之掃射，及轟炸摧毀其汽車羣，擊潰其密集部隊，予以莫大打擊，全隊安返基地。</p>
<p>印光二十八日中央社電敵軍急欲重開渝印公路，本月五·六兩千人，企圖反攻北緬甸。該方面日軍，緬甸國軍及緬甸民衆，即將敵軍降落部隊包國，封鎖其行動，並廣續加以猛攻，業將其大部捕捉殲滅，刻正綱續掃蕩已潛入密林中之敵軍殘部。如敵軍欲挽回頹局之作戰企圖，現又成塵夢。</p>
<h3>加薩附近傘兵　已殲滅一部　南部敵亦遭重大打擊</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電日大本營二十入日發表，日軍在細甸北部富貢地區至孟加拉灣全長一千數百公里之細甸國境綫，對英美渝三軍展開激烈之學滅作戰，日軍在該地區作戰極為順利，敵軍刻已大部陷於混亂之狀態，四散潰逃，各地戰况情形如次：</p>
<h3>印緬北部</h3>
<p>印緬北部國境受美將斯蒂維爾指揮之渝美軍新編第一軍部下第三十入。第二十二兩師及英美編成之二旅，對打通里多公路事頗惑棘手，彼等雖於當貢地區反覆反擎，然巳被日軍運用巧妙戰術，將彼等誘至密芝那西北方之山　地帶，予以包園，故彼等受創甚重。該方面之渝車，雖係美式之優秀裝備及受美將校指揮之有力部隊，然因受地形之阻礙，難以活用其機械。同時，並受日軍巧妙之攻擊，致　重創，入日渝軍大批坦克車因受日軍戰擎及砲隊之猛繫，致被擎毀十數關，戰車掩獲之渝步兵部隊，大半被殲減，誠可謂慘敗。又敵滑翔機部隊約五千人，携帶輕重迫擊砲及機關槍等，於伊洛瓦底河上游之加薩附近降落，欲與富貢地區之敵軍相呼應，企圖擾亂日軍後方，然經日軍及細甸軍之包剿，已殲滅其一部，目前正續行掃蕩殘敵中。</p>
<h3>中部國境</h3>
<p>日軍在中部印細國境方面，包國猛攻琴丘陸及加飽溪谷口之英印第四軍團主力第十七，第二十兩師團，益增强甚殲減戰。同時，日軍及印度國民軍精鋭主力，以機械化部隊作先鋒，使用鹵獲之千餘輛汽車，繼續向伊姆法爾平原進擊，但在伊奶法爾平原大部日軍迫進之前，已呈混亂狀態。關於中部印細國境之戰况，據重慶電合播音稱：日軍在伊姆法爾平原推擊後，富賞地區之斯蒂威爾軍兵站綫，不僅已遭切斷，即駐渝美空軍之接濟，亦有中斷之慮，此已表明日軍破竹進攻前，敵軍陣營狼狽之一斑。</p>
<h3>南部地帶</h3>
<p>日軍在南部印緬國境地帶，於本年二月殲滅英印第七師之後，敵於第一次阿拉坎慘敗中蒙受重創，其後，使第二十六師進　布其頓，圖達正面日軍陣地，同時，強力之日軍增調戰車部隊重砲等，更調派新兵團往該戰綫等，敵在南部印緬國境，積極圖突破日軍陣地，但遭日軍之重大打擊，伊姆法爾方面戰局之進展，最近已呈動搖狀態。又日軍對於進攻加拉頓河谷之西非軍各一師團刻正展開殲滅戰，極為順手，北部國境一帶之殲減戰，現已成時間問題。</p>
<h3>砲轟達姆</h3>
<p>東京一十八日中央社電據緬印戰綫某基地電，日戰車部隊對於達姆週圍，鞏固要寒綫，作頑強抵抗之敵第二十師之殲滅戰，已益形激烈，至二十二日晨，已到達距達姆南方一點五公里之敵機塲，使敵機三架起火燃燒，並全部佔領之，同時，加鮑谷地敵空軍之蠶動，亦被完全控制。又達奶西北方日挺身隊，二十六日對自達姆方向西移動中之携有汽車一千　及戰車二十輛之敵軍展開猛攻，而予以重創。此外達姆市街已落於日軍激烈之砲火中，致數處均行起火燃燒，故敵軍二十師主力之命運，已日薄　　矣</p>
<h3>菲律賓服務團　改組為政黨</h3>
<p>馬尼刺二十九日中央社電新菲律賓服務團，於前年十二月八日成立，該團實為達成獨立目的咎發民衆之機關。邇後即行軍政並作種種活勸，及菲律賓實現獨立後，該服務團更成為菲政府與國民間唯一之連絡機關，而邁進於共和國之建設。頃該服務團本部為適應獨立後之新情勢，使形成一推進國策之織關起見，决自國民運動體改組而為菲律賓唯一公認之政黨。按該團於菲律賓獨立前後，會後事選舉獨立準備委員及國會議員等，故早經賦與政黨之任務，至菲律賓獨立後，國會議員之州知事及市長，復多兼任該團之地方行政部長，現團員已突破百零四萬人，故此次該團改組為單一政黨後，即與政府及國會確立三位一體之關係，更可盡力於共和國之建設事業。</p>
<h3>大東亞戰爭　與中日之使命　谷大使在黨訓團講演</h3>
<p>南京廿八日中央社電谷大使於廿二日下午三時，赴中央黨部中央黨務訓練團講演，題為「大東亞戰爭與中日之使命」歷一小時之久，申述大東亞戰爭之意義甚祥，茲錄原文如下：日本自華盛頓及倫敦軍縮會議以來，即努力維持世界和平，然英美夢想征服世界，每每壓迫日木，以圖達成其野心。然日木因祈求世界和平，力事容忍，從事對美折衝，但彼仍無任何反省。日本為打開民族之命運，遂毅然起而作戰。日軍將士勇敢善鬥，舉獲莫大戰果，至今依然繼續向達成解放東亞，建設新秩序之共同理想邁進。</p>
<p>又盟邦德義兩國，為打開民族之命運奮起，亦自開戰以來，獲大戰果，並與歐洲盟邦各國建設新秩序，獲得光輝成果，此乃周知之事實。目今德國現雖在東綫不得不作出血戰術，他方面撤北非職綫，縮短其不必要職錢，反能强化歐洲要塞，因此英美現在義大利戰綫，已遭困難。其所謂第二戰綫，頗難實現。英美在地中海獲　餘力後，即企圖在太平洋職綫作一大進攻，然在大局上，因細甸戰綫大敗之結果，已化為一片空夢，故其對日反抗，漸呈焦慮與　態。</p>
<h3>中國完成自主</h3>
<p>中日兩國有唇齒輪車之關係，且於民族，於歷史上，有種種交流，然近百年來英美之霸道主義，流人中國後，彼等之謀略，致使同文同種之中日兩國相鬥。然自大東亞戰爭勃發後，英美在中國之勢力已一掃凈盡，而能返還中國本來之姿態。於是日本政府去歲一月九日以來，在政治方面交還租界，及公使館區域，損廢治外法權之改善，其他一切旣存之不合理的措置，更進而實行基木條約之根本改革，中日兩國始克以本然之麥態，相互提携，而向大戰之途邁進。又經濟方面，移交新舊敵產，咸　整各種公司，並以其他經濟的協力，努力發展中國經濟，提高其自主性。又文化方面亦採同樣指置。如上所述之種種措置，均為日本希望中國完成自主獨立’而所實行之道義政策之表現也。</p>
<h3>實現眞正和平</h3>
<p>大東亞之和平，由大東亞各個國家發揮其特色而得，其所昂場其自主性，而能維持之各國鞏固互惠平等原則，以能完遂大戰，完成共榮圈，故日本對於中國所採道義政策，當然對於大東亞之其他國家，亦能採用，於是成立大束亞共同宣言，此為人人所共知者。日本政府所求於中國者，如同盟條約所昭示，爲建設大東亞所有之協力，此又為中國自身之復興與發展。當大東亞戰爭正値一進一退之際，前途明朗之希望，亦正深刻於腦海，故在此千戰難遇之時機，每一國民均須澈底認識車大時局，實行中日提携。根據大束亞宣言，向大東亞建設之途邁進，而須首先實行大東亞俱正之和平，期待東方之光明，早日實現。</p>
<h3>國府有功大員天皇贈予勳章</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電日大使館情報部，木日（二十九日）發表稱：日天皇陛下對致力於中日親善，及遂行大束亞戰爭之國府有功大員，　與勳章。該項勳章，已由日木政府交谷大使轉送。谷大使特於三十日上午十一時，派大野官房長，送至外交部大樓，轉與各受贈者。其在北平與張家口等地之中國大員，分由北平　澤公使，張家口岩崎公使，於同日同時贈送。</p>
<h3>印國民軍建功　鮑斯賜勳章</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電據緬甸某基地電印度國民軍最高司令部發表，自二月四日於南部印緬國境開始英印軍殲滅戰時，日軍協力之下，而參加作戰之印度國民軍前綫挺進部隊長米斯拉少校等十三勇士，會樹立赫赫武攻。鮑斯統帥為褒賞彼等之偉勳，特授予輝煌之動　，對米斯拉少校及梅哈里達斯少尉，更特授以國軍最高榮譽之印度之獅子勳章。</p>
<h3>敵機十六架　襲波那佩島</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電據中部太平洋日軍某基地電，敵B25型機八架，戰鬥機八架，曾於二十七日晨來襲日內南洋波那佩　。日軍戰鬥機及陸上砲火，當邀擊之，擊落其兩架，擊毀其一架，日機自炸兩架。</p>
<h3>澳軍將領更迭</h3>
<p>里斯本廿九日中央社電據康白拉來訊，澳洲陸軍部長胡爾德週二公布，任命莫斯赫中將為澳第二軍司令，並暫理新進內亞軍司令部事宜。前澳參謀長駐華盛頓軍事代表團首席代表凡爾莫中將，任澳第一軍司令，現服務於參謀處之貝利曼將，任澳軍第二隊指揮官，前在中東與新幾內亞等處服務之賽未基少將升中將，任澳軍第一隊指揮官。此外，尙有馬凱少將任駐印高級　員，賴弗克中將任澳駐華盛頓軍事團首席代表，赫林中將任維多利亞最高法院首席審判。</p>
<h3>後宮淳大將兼任日陸軍航空總監　陸省發表航空首腦部異動</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日陸軍為適應航空决戰之現戰局，乃斷行異動航空關係首腦部，並於二十八日正式發表如次：　參謀次長後宮淳大將兼任陸軍航空總帥之航空總監及航空本部長，　安田前航空總監任軍事參議官。　日陸軍航塵界宿答德川好敵中將，被任為陸軍航塵士官學校校長。　防衛總司令部織參謀長佐野忠義中將，已轉任某要職，遺缺由該總司令部創設常時之首屆　參謀長小林淺三郎中將織任。按後宮參謀次長之兼任航空總監，係將决定戰同歸趨之航空關係之最高指導置於該大將一元之統帥下，以期强力運營，此與海軍司令部次長塚原中將之兼任航空本部長具同樣之意義。又此次德川中將任航空士官學校校長，小林中將任防衛德參謀長，日陸軍航空關係首腦部可謂已構成最强之陣容。茲誌日陸軍省發表如次：　軍事參議官兼參謀次長陸軍大將後宮淳，兼任陸軍航塵總監，陸軍航空本部長。　陸軍中將安田武雄任軍事參議官。　陸軍中將德川好敏任陸軍航空士官學校長。　陸軍中將小林淺二郎任防衛總參謀長。</p>

<h3>國府還都紀念陳院長廣播詞</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　二十九日為宣傅部主辦之國府還都四週年紀念特別廣播演講第五日，是日下午九時至九時三十分，由立法院長陳公博氏担仟廣播，題為還都的意義和目前的工作，原文如下：</p>
<p>親愛的同胞們，明日是國民政府還都四週年紀念了，我很想把還都的意義和現在我們的工作，重新告訴親愛的同胞們。國民政府還都的最主要目的，和最重大意義，是在要求全面和平，所以當還都之始，提出和平反共建國，為國民政府的國策。我們戰求全面和平的懷抱，至今不懈，而薪求全面和平的努力，也至今不裘。但是我們所要求的和平，决不是苟且置安的和平。所以最初還都，就提出永久和平的口號。我們也决不是　求不平等和平，所以由二十九年底簽訂中日基本條約時，即提出日本應該不斷的自動的修正已定的關係，而中國也應該不斷的自動的增好未來的關係的希望。直至去年年底，和日本成立同盟條約，我們的志願於以完成，於此可見我們最初所抱負的永久和平，平等和平，我們無不悉力以赴，可以對關家，可以對國民，並且可以對自己，今日國民政府還都經已四年，全面和平還沒有實現，我們賣在覺得非常遣憾。然而我們的衷心未當一日改變，而我們的努力未嘗一日懈意。這是可以訴之於全國，不但要求中國的和平，要求中日的和平，還要求全束亞的眞正和平。因此於去年一月九日宣佈參加大東亞戰爭，這次參加　爭，完全本着孫先生大亞洲主義，和聯合世界上平等待我之民族，共同奮門的遺言，而且深覺我們亞洲之中有帝國主義的存在，必不能和平，有殖民地的存在，也不能和平。故在日木展開大東亞戰爭之俄頃，即决定參加，從一年間的準備，終於實現，足見我們所號召的和平意義，决不是茍且的，而是深遠的，並且不是局部的，而且是廣大的。所謂全面和平也不單指中國的，而是指全亞洲的。</p>
<h3>當前重要工作</h3>
<p>國民政府還都的意義，旣巳闡明，我可以進而述目前我們的工作了。今年元且，主席曾經詔示我們，今後的工作是肅正思想，保陣治安，增加生產，道三神都是一面樹立建國的基礎，而一面完成大東亞戰爭。所謂肅正思想。目前已加强新國民運動，務使每一個國民，都能蕩滌國敗思想，向前邁進，消滅個人主義，進而成為國家集體主義，排除自由主義，進而成為國家資本主義，擴大狹義的民族主義，進而成為國家集團主義。關於妨害身心的毒品，更不惜集國家人民之力，根本消滅關於妨書社會的陋俗，更以强調姿態，根本　除。</p>
<p>關於增加生產，我們承認不止是拔術上問題，而是國民一般的責任和組織問題。以後我們的努力，當朝着這一個新的方向邁進。政府在過去的一年，也會對抑平物價，和取締投機與囤積，盡極大的努力，但始終承認抑平物價，須着重於增加生產，今後當加强全國農業機關，和地方農村的機構，以國增加農產品。而且已由中　銀行準備十萬萬的資金，以入厘的低利率，貸與有關民生和軍需鈞各工廠，以圖增加工業品。現在由財政和實業兩部，研究具體貸借扶植的方案。過去也知物資移動的取締和限制，不免發生物資流通的障礙和因難，現正研究使其圓滑交流，凡屬障礙的，分別加以修正。這樣我深信關於增加生產，和抑平物價，當有很大的效果。</p>
<p>關於保障治安，目前建軍巳有相富基礎，今後當悉力訓總部隊，改良士兵生活，以迎合治安的耍求。過去淸鄉在地方上已有不少的成績，以後當更改革機稱，使各地的保安機構，成為一元有力的執行機關，務使人民能够安居，能雊樂業。一面樹立自治的規模。一面集其全力，以取得大束亞戰爭的勝利。</p>
<p>末了，我更惡鄭重吿諸親愛的同胞。提倡廉潔，肅淸盒汚，本為政府還都確定的方針。遺次嚴懲糧食舞弊，更予人民以政府决心澄淸吏治的深刻信念。我也知道人民對於政府這次决心，非常興奮。但我要吿訴諸君，還次政府不是當為一件興奮的事，而引為國家非常不幸的事。比年以來，政府以療漠不復，岌岌瘀其心力於流亡撫輯，對予官更不免有時寬予優待，以故每每疏於防止犯罪，而流於縱容犯罪，到了罪在不赦，綫緩然明正典刑。這班會汚之徒，因法在當誅，而政府也不能辭事前疏於防範，養成犯罪之答，這一點我們應該以罪己精神，來自責的。我深盼今後各當局，　於律已，直比牽人，不袛耍在事後嚴憊犯罪去着眼。尤應從事前防止犯罪去着眼。不要縱之在前，憊之在後。一人的犯罪懲罰，紙博稱快一時，而萬民之受書，早已滿苦無已。這樣一面所以保全國家和社會的元氣，一面可以使政治得到有大正的淸明，今日在與民更始之時，我不憚再三鄭重申明政府的本意。</p>
<h3>滿大使祝詞　徵文評閱完竣揭曉</h3>

<h3>黨訓團學員　首期畢業禮　陳院長代汪兼團長訓話</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電黨務工作人員訓綀團第一期學員，業已受訓期滿，昨二十九日上午十時，於中央黨部大禮堂，舉行畢業典禮。到中央執監委員林柏生·陳羣·彭年·徐蘇中·葉蓬·鮑文越（周正已代）·陳濟成·馬典如·李福一·陳昌祖·楊傑·汪曼雲。李文濱·李凱臣·程中匡等。暨中央黨部各部廳會秘書處長以次各工作同志，曁全體　員等百餘人，由該團陳敎育長戴副敎育長主持典禮。行禮如儀後，首由陳敎育長報吿，繼由汪之認識，今後工作任務等，　勉有加。全體學員聆後極為感奮。嗣由學員代表致　詞，末由陳敎育長頒發學業證書獎狀，攝影後，典禮始於軍樂鏗鏘聲中完成。</p>
<h3>團長訓詞</h3>
<p>今天為中央黨務工作人員訓　國第一期結業之期，本團長以抱病未痊，不能親臨訓話，特筆述數端，爲諸同志告：</p>
<p>本堂日六全大會以後，以和平反共建國相號召，是國民革命之過程，已趨人新階段。繼之大東亞戰爭爆發，繼之國府實行參戰，以救中日同盟之成立，不僅奠定大東亞各國永久友好之基礎，亦且奠定全世界永久和平之基礎。本黨為國民政府之母體，當國民政府負荷起劃時代的大任務之今日，木黨黨員，應如何加倍奮勉，加倍努力。本「先之勢之，為民前鋒」之旨，事亭為天之先。危險所在，以身先之，艱難所在，以身勢之。須知以一個黨員之個人身分，去策動民衆，去倡導風氣，其惑動之力量，較諸互相勸善爲大，較諸强迫命令篇更大。所以今後的黨員，不能自居在民衆之上，今後的黨都，不能比擬與政府租同，黨員應深入民間去活勸，黨部應協助政府。過去黨員為官僚，黨部為衙門，執政者旣有雙廥領導之嫌，而民衆則甚感無所適從之苦，此類積習非蕩滌净盡不可，在今日之新時代，非振刷起全黨同志之新精神，不足以突破新關　，而完成新使命。（未完）</p>

<p>柏林廿九日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍在南路中段之轟伯河與布格前綫之間。自特蘭斯尼斯特里亞（Transnistria）至茄里西亞（Galicia）續施重壓，卒因德國機羣之不斷轟炸，蘇軍攻勢始趨鬆弛，德羅聯軍現仍在巴爾帶—基希奈夫（Balti-Kishinev）區內堅守每一據點，同時該虎德軍後衛亦擔負掩護德軍自普魯斯退守新陣地之任務。蘇軍先鋒隊雖已獲進抵普魯斯（Pruth），但尙未獲渡過該河，德軍壓向蘇軍實施側擊，會在北茄重西亞。聶斯　。與普魯斯之間展開激戰。蘇軍在泰諾渡爾與波羅斯科洛夫間分兩路向南進攻，卡孟納資波杜爾斯克之部隊，現亦遭遇遏阻，波羅斯科洛夫守軍因恐受側面包國之危險，現已開始向東南撤退，後衛與之激戰甚烈。該處德軍現正遂漸退至聶斯特，以與鄰近友軍取得聯絡，尼柯拉耶夫。貝伏曼斯克南部之障礙陸地，情形良好，蘇軍亦已承認進攻失敗，幷已放棄渡過下布格河之企圖。慈軍擬自貝伏曼斯克—巴爾達向南推進，威脅德軍陳地之側　行動，亦已於日前遺遇搓敗。德在下布格河南部之守軍，現正嚴拒沿黑海推進之蘇軍，德軍在轟斯特河北面之反攻，已獲遇阻向動伏甫（即勒姆堡）推進之蘇軍部隊。蘇軍在杜勃諾與柯維爾間先鋒隊亦受過阻，幷已展開爭奪柯維爾之激戰。</p>

<h3>今日下午慶祝大會</h3>
<p>今日為國府還都四週年紀念日，値茲大東亞戰爭入於决戰階段之際，舉國上下，莫不振會，熱烈慶祝，上海市民福利協會，上海工商聯誼會，中國國民外交促進會，中華電影公司，上海新聞聯合會，愛特聯合舉行慶祝國府還都四週年紀念大會，今日下午一時假座靜安寺路大光明大戲院，市宣傳慮特予贊助。大會秩序：　全體肅立，　奏樂（第一警察局樂隊），　唱國歌，　向國旗及國父遺　行最敬禮，　致開會詞，　演講，（陳市長袁　登氏）　歌詠，　餘興，（放映華影名片，大富之家）　散會，屆時情况定必空前熱烈。</p>
<h3>國府還都四週年　陳市長談話　協力建設新上海</h3>
<p>國府還都條已四週年，當茲大東亞戰爭入於决戰階段之際，舉國上下莫不愈益奮發，中央社記者以滬市租界收回後紀念此含有歷史性之紀念日，憲藝尤為重大，特繼訪陳市長，承發表談話如左：</p>
<h3>中華民族必獲光明</h3>
<p>國府還都，　忽四載，回　四戴以來，東亞局勢之變動，至為急劇，幸賴中樞當局秉還都之初衷，排除萬難，悉力以赴，於調整邦交，刷新政治，保障治安，統一通貨，及强化經濟建設等施政方針，更復鄭重將事，逐步促其實現，此種收獲。信足告　於國民者，溯自大東亞戰爭進入第二年度，國府為協力盟邦，一掃英美之殘暴，以謀中國之復與，東亞之解放，愛於去年一月九日，毅然對敵國英美宣戰，至是中日之邦交益形增　，我國之戰時體制，漸臻確立，同年十一月六日大柬亞宣言之發表，更確保東亞民族之團結，而前綫盟軍，英勇奮發，迭予敵軍以打學。比者捷報頻傅，國人莫振不　，於遵奉國第，勵行增產，肅淸烟賭，及掃蕩會汚等工作，倍增努力，此不獨象微中華民族之必獲光明，亦證明東亞各國之必獲解放。</p>
<h3>市政進行至感順利</h3>
<p>以本市而言，自余奉命長滬，瞬逾三載，並無若何驚人建樹，然在此短促之時間中，於民食·治安·交通·敎育諸端，亦會鋭意改進，迨去年八月，荷盟邦之協力，無論公共與專管租界，全部先後收回，各國在華之治外法權，亦吿全部撤廢，百年來遭受不平等條約東縛之上海，於今幸獲解放，本年二月，且將原有之行政畛域，予以消滅，將畸形現狀，實行調整，至是本市之行政，遂歸統一。復承本市各界人士之協助，市政進行，至惑順利，近日最感棘手之抑平物價，亦獲良好之成效，然告人雖有些微收獲，仍未敢引以自滿，唯有繼績努力，薪施政方針早日按次實現，市政建設早日克底於成。</p>
<h3>努力增產肅淸食汚</h3>
<p>今日之上海施政，即羣承國府之指示，以努力增加生產，禁絕烟賭，及肅淸員汚爲急務。增加生產一項，在戰爭期問固多障碍，本市因原料缺乏，生產銳減，雖一再設法，迄木衝破難關，最近對原料已稍有解决辦法，而電力供給之增加與否銀行放款之減息。在在予增產以奧援，木市之增產問題或可望逐漸奏效，肅淸烟賭一項，自國府頒布蔡烟辦法大綱，及麻醉藥品管理條例，並定於本日實施，以必禁毒工作，自　積極推行，本市賭窟，本府已有禁令，於　日實行全部關閉，上海市民於烟賭禁絕之後，應覓正當娛樂，以健全身心，而致力本位工作。至於掃荡貪汚，亦即本人向所倡導之康潔政治，余於北伐前在　東時，已隨汪主席積　提倡，國府沒都後復會為文倡導，當時有謂廉潔政治不能樹立，和平建國之目的，不能建成，今日更可進一步言，康潔政治不能樹立，建設新上海與　中國之目的亦永不能實現。最近中央對貪汚官吏，嚴予究辦，特別法庭執法嚴正，顯見政府確具决心，木府常　中央意旨，切實勵行，期以康潔政治為出議點，產到建設新上海之目的。然政府任何施政，均須賴人民之協力，平日如此，戰時尤甚，今後尙冀與市民諸君，緊密合作，一心一德，以求新上海建設之實現，新中國復興之完成。</p>

<h3>日對印緬作戰　發展極有利　日陸軍報道部檢討戰况</h3>
<p>日駐華上海陸軍部報這部，於昨日午後三時，假座華懋飯店八樓，定例會見本市中國新聞記者團，由赤里　託即席對印緬戰况發表談話如下：</p>
<h3>一路猛進勢如破竹</h3>
<p>國府還都調屆四週我人於國府還都四週年之前夕，檢討緬印軍事發展之情形，自屬更有意義。大東亞戰爭之目的，在解放東亞民族，確立大東亞共榮圈，以促大亞洲主義之實現。這在大東亞共同實言中已充分表明，但此崇高之目的，吾人以何法得能達到，無疑地從戰爭中爭取。吾人巳目睹緬菲兩大民族之獨立解放，此外復有印度三萬萬民族之獨立解放，此種並非徒託空言，實為事實之表現。吾們見到昨日大木營發表，細甸少狀况，是在非常有利之中發展，其中特別是中部印細國境方面，對革印第四軍主力，正總績施以猛烈攻擎，日軍和印國民軍並肩作戰，以機械化部隊爲先鋒，沿塔　及伊竭法爾之道，猛烈前進，一路勢如破竹，去印緬國境僅入十公里，距以塔舉遺塲為根據地之敵陣僅九十餘公里之遙。印度國民軍之突破國境，實予其祖國以極大反響，因此在印度國民軍獨立二色旗之下，投順者日增，該單所到之處，即恢復而成為印度獨立政府之領土，此即證明印度民族之解放與光榮獨立，正現實地積極展開。</p>
<h3>驅逐英美侵略勢力</h3>
<p>換習之，印度國民軍之進展，則為英席國主義侵略勢力，自印度方而開始撤退之表現，　印度三萬　民衆所希　獨立之現實上來講，也可說是他自然的歸趨。　印度進攻，這好　是大東亞不幸的自相裝殺的職爭，可是事實上决不是以印度軍作對手，其目標乃爲驅逐英美之侵略勢力，印度國民軍向祖國進擊，吾人不能即認為他是從一條康莊大道上進行，因為那裹之作戰，與歐洲德國之戰爭，實有極大關係，在間接方面，也具有重大的意義，因為英國若失却印度，英國即不能在歐洲繼續作戰，所以英國不能忽視其在印度之危機，而於歐洲開關第二職綫。吾人同惑至少歐洲戰塲一旦道種危機到了非常　迫的時侯，對東方一定有相當的牽制，敵方曾構：伊姆帕術為尼布王爾國內之英軍根擴地」，所以日印兩軍之正面敵軍，即為英軍第十四師團。吾人試觀央美或渝方之反鬱，即可明暸敵方對日印兩軍之進攻為尼布爾時，驚惶失措之程良矣。</p>
<h3>日軍攻印敵方重視</h3>
<p>茲將列舉數例如后路透社二十四日紐約電「日軍進攻印度之消息，連日在紐約各報，刋於首版極　著之地位，尤以該地之郵局中，協約軍在印慘敗之消息。　乎戰　。所以紐約泰晤土報之軍事評論家電爾德威云：「日軍進攻印度，是把握着一絕好的機會，無論　路上，政治上，均有充分的確實性」所以紐約NBC廣播電合關於進攻印度一節，於二十七日曾發表廣播，謂協約軍現已遭遇第二次新加坡之局面，日軍對印度之進攻，較之一般所想像者，更為覆重，日軍一且到達伊姆怕爾，協約軍廣大之軍站棧，將遭全部切斷，而通達於重慶之新關公路，亦將失其價値奐，又據偷敦二十四日寒晤士報稱：日軍之作發，祗要局部成功，則舉丘嶺地帶之協約軍，除撤退以外，別無他法，再悉紐約時報　渝通訊員馬薩於二十五日對共木國發電種：「重慶一般民衆方面，他們都抱有非常深刻之憂慮及苦悶，他們認為不日將要把重慶方面頭果僅存之生命綫切斷，所以不能將這種目前的危機視同草芥」云。由於以上種　不安情緒，竟亦影響到印度貨幣之價値，使一向價値很高之盧比，因此而突然暴跌。</p>
<h3>布號業批發商　組織聯營處　資金總額定為一萬萬元</h3>
<p>關於棉布集中配給事宜，商統會督由上海特別市布號業同業公會，就批發商全體會員，組織聯合營業處，受商統會之指導，辦理零售商棉布之配給，及其他指定配給事宣。現該會將上海特別市布號業批發商聯合營業處章程擬就，呈准頗統會進行籌組中，並經商統會指定籌備員召集籌備會議，决定組織大　，辦理會員登記，凡在民國卅二年入月十日，政府公佈收買棉紗棉布暫行條例以前，加人布號業同業公會會員之批發商，申謂出賣棉布滿三十疋者，均可申請加入聯營處為會員。該處資金總額，定爲中戲券一萬萬元，分作一百萬股，每股一百元，由參加商號按其向商統會申請出賣布疋總數之此率認繳之，凡滿三十疋者，得認繳十股，不滿三十疋者不計，內部組織，設委員十五人，組織委員會主持一切事務，由十五委員中公推常務委員五人，再就常務委員中公推主任委員副主任委員各一人，主任委員綜理一切處務，副主任委員為對外代表人，常務委員輔佐主任委員處理日常事務，幷以上海特別市布號槳公會為常然之監察人，監察一切業務及資金之運用，該處委員以下，設總務·業務·財務·三科，辦理各項事務，聞該聯營處四月初旬即可正式成立。</p>

<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3>當務之急</h3>
<p>新任本市第一區公署吳署長於其日昨所發表之談話中　過：「區政之改善，自為當務之急，而民生問題之合理解决，與社會風氣之如何轉移，尤屬根本要國。」殊覺意前而言賅。</p>
<p>今日經濟上海的屬給所在，即在於民生問題之未能澈底調整，與社會風氣之未俳從根改革；萬於前者，什麼食糧不時匱乏了，燃料不時恐慌了，人民日常用品之不能維持當周限價了，　窮陸級之不能獲到救濟辦法了，行人財物之於夜間廣遭刦奪了，諸如此類，不一而足；屬於後者，什麼囤　投機一類的　利思想了，沉湎於烟·賭·舞的消沉氣態了，窮奢極欲，浪費金錢與物資的惡劣習慣了，諸如此類，又復不一而足。</p>
<p>誠然，我們知道當局對於設重的民生問題，與惡劣的社會風氣，是正在盡其最大的努力與决心，以謀解决，可是，解决之道，始終總是覺得未免屬於浮面的，限於局部的，其歷來　結所在，難道是在於心有餘而力不足麼？如果是不錯的話，那末，當務之急，便在於加强地方行政的力量；凡是與靜决民生問題，轉移肚會風氣有關的一切與一切，務須做到「令出必行」，並且行之澈底。這綫定挽救匕海經濟危機的終南捷徑。</p>

<p>敎育之爲用也大矣：識世界總勢。而生愛護國家心；明機械原理，而增工作効率性；知是非黑白而去愚魯；悉仁義道德而除欺詐；明德新民而止於至善，捨敎育何由哉！是以立國於犬地，欲　致富自强者，莫不以普及敎育，與革新敎育　要務也。</p>
<p>吾國敎育之不普及，著於世界，文盲者佔百分之八十有　，益以已存敎育之　敗，遂致敎育成果，蕩焉泯焉。處今之世，極目四顧，敗國病民，以圖自肥者；能力低下，濫竽充數者；乃至很混漢漢，投機取巧者；項背相望，比比皆是，數千載文化之邦，幾似深山澤國，徧地禽獸，茍猶不以敎育爲念，滅種亡國，不旋踵而至　論躋身强國之林哉？</p>
<p>論敎育之道有二：敎育失學國民與改善現行敎育制度是也。於列强各國，爲實行强迫敎育，故無有以失學國民爲問題者，吾國則不然，數十年惟以爭戰爲事，朝居高位，暮猶未定，五日京兆，誰復，敎育制度，類皆由三數留學生訂定。頗有不合國情，非如國之自然發展者可比，此要亦不容忽視者也。</p>
<h3>義務教育</h3>
<p>吾國素無義務敎育，貧苦之家，不知敎育之重要，加以負担奇重，七八齡之幼童，牽賴之工作，以謀稍補家用，豈有餘睱從事讀書者哉！爲今之計，誠宜廣設失學國民義務敎育學校，使其復有受敎育之機會，則愚者直而詐者智，非　望也。</p>
<p>事之長大者，莫過於經費，提倡者不可不顧及於此，愚以爲義務額學校之校址，即刻利用原有學校，蓋原有學校牽夜空關，無所事事，義務學校假其便，則無有間突，而卓椅教室不勢分心，即晚間求學，不與日間工作相背，此可省者一·教室之類，可由各級！範生充之，不足，則另募熱心人士，愚意當不成問題，此可省者而·至於書，　，用具，爲政府者，責無旁，當當任其半：爲人民者，當仁不讓，分捐其半；則經濟難關，其可稍舒乎？至於教育年限，愚意可暫定三年，泊後成　漸著國庫漸充，則延而畏之，固無不可也。其敎材更宜實用，簡單，可以國語，常識，算　，充之。</p>
<p>吾人更利用保甲制度，設立此等學校，凡聯保中文盲多者，設一聯保養務學校。少者聯合數保，設一聯保聯合學校，則效力更可增加矣。</p>
<h3>補習學校</h3>
<p>以上所論乃義務敎育，即不論何人，均須强迫受授，自此而上，即爲初級補習學校，凡畢業於義務校而有志於深造者均得升入·此時國家可視其財力，而決　其是否為　務教育：設經濟　竭，則初級補　學校得　收費用，以資補助。其課卓教室及教員，當儘景利用原有學校，俾節開支。而易設者，可進入高級補習學校，其性質猶今之補習學校，而經改善者也。</p>
<p>目前之補習學校，以商科系爲大多數，次之則爲外國文系，捨之兩者，即謂之　補　學校亦可。吾人莫不知振興　工業之重要，與夫有智　之「熟練農工人」之缺乏，足以影響農工業之改進，而竟無所以養存有能力最工人之機關，寗非怪事·故我國之所謂熟練工人，（意指有高度工作效率之工人（均於廠中服務有年，然後將其工作之經騐，與機械之運用之純熟者也。知其然而不知其所以然，保守之未遑，宏諭改進·且如是而成之人，安能應日增一日之需要哉。補救之道，未有勝於設立晨工業補習學校者。</p>
<h3>小學體育</h3>
<p>今之小學，（中學亦然）因環境特殊，其人數超過正常殊甚云·小學課　之複雜，亦有改善之必要：以高小二年級而論，其所讀書計國語，算術，英文，珠算，社會，自然，日文等，推考學者年齡，大抵自十一至十三歲，夭以如是幼之學童，能否負擔，甚爲疑問，學而是否了解，更成問題；至於影響健康，尤爲嚴重。予屢見幼童溫習，其書桌上嚴國文，英文，日文置焉，如專家狀，然叩其所學，鮮有能道之者，此固不足球也學學科之不合理，不僅外國語，即珠算亦然，所授者大部爲加，減法，至多不過乘法，自　業者而言，尙不失爲實用，而自多數之升學者觀之，不過許　之不如理想，不徒小學爲然，中學大學亦何嘗不如是。</p>
<p>敎材方面，亦有問題，如英文然，所敎皆屬古典，及文藝，實與需要背道而馳。又如國文等，社會上方鼓吹採用白話，廢除文言，而敎人者則正從事於舍白話而用文言，世界上方提倡發展個性，而學校當軸猶保守數世紀之舊法，使學生作八股文，凡此種種，皆必須修正老也。</p>
<h3>中學教育</h3>
<p>近年中學，頗有趨向於分科之勢然。最需要之晨科，尙無正式開辦者，此一大憾事也，案濺業人才，其需要視工業人才而過之，蓋吾華以農立國，農民幾過百份之八十，耕地之廣，著於世界。然囚昧於蟲，　之防，肥料之施，氣候之影響，土壤之專宜，故農作物之半，皆傷於是，所謂「收穫」直自然之殘肴耳！脫預爲之防，則以如斯之衆，如斯之土，富而强立待可至，謂農業，人才過於工人，」非故作驚人之書也。</p>
<p>分科而後，有一事不可不注意者，即各科之限制是也。敎有部於職業人員之多寡，所需人材之所在，與在學靑年之人數，當作　密之統計，視其所需，視其所少，然　規定某科若干人，某科若干人，則畢業而後，個人不致有無運地之歡，社會不致有用人無才之苦，然後業能進而功能著也。</p>
<p>限制之法，亦可用於大學，如敎育部鑒於文法科人才太多，而理工科人才不足，則可命令文法科停止招生一年，而增加理工學校，則供求相埒，畢業即失業之言，將成曆史陳蹟矣。</p>
<p>其次，吾人現行敎育，忽略德。體·羣。育殊甚，所謂敎育，似僅指智育而言，試　学校課程，十之九均屬智育，德·羣一之育，無有一焉。即有有一二節「體育」，亦莫不視若弁髦，敎師旣變爲無足輕重，學生亦一向隨意去留，體育早已名存實亡矣。夫十念歲之間，非人生决定健康之時乎！舍此時而不鍛鍊身體，豈將期來世乎！且病夫之體，代代相傳，於今已數千年矣。一代不强，後代之强也更難，數千年之惡習，茍不棄之，則人不滅吾，吾將自滅矣·而鍛鍊身體，非靑年之時，則勤苦而難成，學校之於學生體育，曷可不注意歟？</p>
<h3>女子教育</h3>
<p>再就女子敎育而　　，吾國與歐美皆同無分軒輊，　女子與男子之個性不同，不可掩也。溯自男女同學以來，女子受敎育　，不可枚舉也。然觀其後果，多爲主婦而已，授受敎育，無絲毫補益，日緣是而不能，亦不願作家務·進不能爲社會　務，退不能　家庭置；卽不如歐美女子之進出於社會；又不能如舊式女子之掃酒於家庭；十數年之敎育，徒爲社會。家庭。之審生蟲耳·凡此皆敎育者昧於國情，强欲以女子同於男子之故也。不觀於日本乎，其女子敎育即截然不同於男子，蓋深知强欲以女子與男子等，猶云智者必與愚者同其，敗也固宜。愚意女子敎育，權分二種，其一即同於男子，使可爲社會服務；其一即訓練處理家務，略似於日本，使可爲家庭置理·庶可免博而寡要，勞而少功之幣乎·</p>
<h3>其他</h3>
<p>最後有　於教者而不可不雷者，曰：「國音之運用」是也。夫言語之隔膜，足以使國家分裂，前國民政府有　於此，曾採用北平語爲國語，明令學校運用於敎授，頗著成效，　戰事一起，監督乏人，少數學校，遂公然干令，置之不顧，半途而廢，中道而劃，惜哉。雖然督促勸吿，輿論有力，實不可辭也。</p>
<p>關於敎者，亦有二者，須加注意者：其一，即敎員之生活問題，蓋生活不安定，枵腹從公，勢所難能，欲求心不外驚，非生活安定不可故也。愚以爲學校不論大小。統由敎員組織而管理之，因校長一之設，總不免剝削敎員之利權，如中問商人·如是則不致爲校長者面　　·而爲教者面菜色也。</p>
<p>敎師之資格，不可不嚴，濫竽充數，誤人非小。日本之小學敎師，其稈　不過我國高中一二，而其小學敎育成績，遠優於我，何則師嚴故也。案吾國執師敎者，一紙文憑足矣，是以舞弊頗多。愚意當亦如醫帥之須經考試，及格而谷方可從。卽其弊可稍殺歟</p>
<h3>戰時消費特稅　徵收辦法的商榷</h3>
<p>— 蔣駿</p>
<p>自小年一月十六日國民政府財政部公佈征收國民戰時消費特稅以還，瞬已二月，其征收品目稅　大略分爲物品零售，筵席旅館，娛樂三項。第一項物品零售特稅內規定金銀首飾，古玩皮貨，賭具樂器奢侈品征百分之十；其他普通物品征百分之四，第二項筵席旅館特稅包括公庽，茶室，咖啡館等一律征百分之十五，第二）項娛樂消費特稅分甲：電影賽馬音樂。乙：戲劇歌唱說書　技·丙：其他跳舞等奢侈娛樂三類；征百分之十至百分之四十。惟　項特稅迄今尙未開征，至其他米，煤，鹽等必需品則免征之，並規定爲國稅收入之一部，此項稅例，際此戰時，爲消極限制國民消費提倡節約，自無非　，且戰時各國早有類似先例，一般巾民富無拒繳之情事；况上海一隅，自三十一平六月起平有征收二厘零售捐及輾單捐之據　，故對一般國民與論自無苛稅印象，惟當時於征收辦法並無詳細確定，以致日久弊端百出，現姑勿論三省一市之如何征收？且就筆者所知上海區而言，該項稅款當局之眞實收入額，估計大約僅有二三成左右。內有七八成均已半途　入代收者私囊矣！</p>
<p>自二月一日一八二區實行合併，當局特於區公署財務處內設一特稅科，專司征收消費特稅事宜，惜其征收辦法一本前工部局先例，由各商店每月自　繳解，再由該科派遺檢查人員挨戶審　其是否附合逐日門市收入帳目之總數，如有虛報等情，則苛以嚴厲警罰，此項辦法；粗視之是無缺點，在一般究善會計制度之原則下，屬妥當，如一般正式合夥商店，公司等，確是涓滴呈報，並無虛繳等情，然在多數中國老式　記中·便有不少應為矣！茲就筆者見　所知，略如下述：</p>
<h3>作弊的由來</h3>
<p>第一：一般小型另售店，大率僅有夫妻二口，兼僱一二學徒，此種商店根本並無會計設備，每月所　完全可與原收不符，因其僅有極間單之收付體目，收入支出之多寡，可自行酌量而記入，如一般小烟店，炒貨店等，再進而爲一種較大之商店如　貨店，糖食店，百貨店一彼輩售出貨物，很少付給買客以發票，而其會計均爲舊式薄制，每日營業收入，可隨意提——若千記以其他帳目，則其攔稅情形，極爲明顯，又如般小型旅館及酒菜舖，其每日營業額亦大抵以多報少，因其雖付給帳單，而甚少有存根可撿。</p>
<p>第二：特稅科所派遺檢查人員，對於審稽方面是極感困難，因一部份商店幾有無從查起之感，而少數奢侈品店，酒樓等，內竟有二種帳簿設備，一眞一假，眞帳則在夜間私記，因調查員决無晚上往查也！例如石路某一衣莊，其每月所繳稅款僅有四五千元之譜，一家糖食店祗有三四千元然一查其總帳每月支出恒在一二十萬元，再加鉅額進貨款項，試問此相差之餘額，究竟自何而來？惟彼等類皆言作批發收入，而細核其批發回單店號而覆檢之，不難破綻立見！</p>
<p>對於上列兩極情形，稅收當局每被混漆，不若旁觀者之淸晰明瞭，揆如目前特稅收入每月約五千餘萬元，較諸過去工部局時期之數百萬元及去年度之一二千萬元以爲超出已多，成績斐然，殊不知稅牽之增加一倍難可估計，而物價直綫上升之迅速遠超於稅款收入之增加率，　自農歷年以還，物價指數，幾漲一倍，而此項稅收並未劇增，故筆者可得結論：除南京路幾家大公司及有完善忠實之會計制度之公司店肆外，均有或多或少之攔收稅款嫌疑，故極須從速改進征收辦法庶一般小民賴血汗所入兢兢繳納之稅款，不致半途夭失，務須涓滴歸公，使一般乘機攔稅之徒自行斂跡。無法施其技倆而後已！　慮見及經驗所得不外三端。</p>
<h3>改善的辦法</h3>
<p>第一：財政部可發行一種消費特稅稅票，其形式可同印花稅郵票等，由各商店分別按照其銷貨總額按月自行認購，而於售貨收捐稅時連同印花稅票一併貼於發票上，如小型另售店之無發票給與買客者，可逕貼於貨物之包皮紙上，再由商店蓋印或劃　以銷票，如香烟一項，即未有包皮紙者，也可貼於烟壳上，倘未貼稅票之發票或貨物，購買人得拒絕繳稅，至稅票票額可分：一百元，五十元，十元，五元，一元，五角六種，按其應納額分別貼於發票上戚帳單上。</p>
<p>第二：爲防止商店及購買人通同舞弊與鼓勵各店號踴躍承銷該項稅票起見，可由特稅征收　關規定給予代收店號百分之五之手續費，如代扣所得稅之手續費然，即該稅票可以九五折發售各代收店號也！此種辦法　有印刷賽用及九五佣金損失，然其所支兩共　佔稅額之總收入不足一成，而較諸現行損失達七八成之數相比，可爲完善多多。</p>
<p>第三：除以上二種辦法外，仍由調查員分赴各商店稽查營　收人總額之是否符合於承銷稅票額，及具存餘票數，是否尙有虛弊作為而加以檢舉·</p>
<p>設上述三端一經實行，商店人民二得其益，無不樂於遵行，而政府國稅收入也必劇增無已，　上海一區而言，每月估計可增至二萬萬元以上，　補稅政，實非淺鮮，是我國民所深切盼　也。</p>

<h3>Commemoration of the National Government's Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>Time flies, and it has been four years since the National Government returned to the capital. Today, on this commemorative day, we remember the source of the water we drink and express our boundless respect for those who, before the return of the National Government, traveled and campaigned without fear of danger. We also deeply admire Mr. Wang Jingwei and some Kuomintang comrades for overcoming difficulties, advocating peace, and creating today's situation. Today marks the fourth celebration of the return to the capital, and as we close our eyes and reflect, we feel that the only thing worth celebrating is the correctness of the peace policy, which becomes truer with time. Four years ago, at the beginning of advocating peace and in the short period after the return to the capital, most people not only did not understand the peace policy but also regarded it as unorthodox. After experiencing hardship and struggle, a foundation for both foreign and domestic affairs was gradually established, and those who previously did not understand the peace policy gradually shifted their views. After Japan implemented its new policy toward China, more and more people gradually recognized and accepted the peace policy. It was through the efforts of the peace movement that Japan implemented its new policy toward China and that a unified front of East Asian nations could jointly resist foreign enemies.</p>
<p>However, the day the National Government returned to the capital also marked the beginning of undertaking a major mission, and until today, the mission has not been completed, and the responsibility cannot be shirked for a single day. What is the major mission? First, it is to improve the people's livelihood. In our newspaper's editorial on January 27, 1943, it was said: "Any problems that the Chongqing side cannot solve for the benefit of the country and the people, especially those that the Chongqing side has said and done but have already failed, the people, since last spring when Japan announced its new policy toward China, have gradually implemented, and notable examples include the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the return of enemy property, assistance in economic control, and the strengthening of the National Government. Although Japan can concretely implement these, whether it can gain the understanding of the Chinese people and to what extent that understanding is profound still depends on whether the National Government's politics can cooperate as a prerequisite. If the National Government's politics fail to cooperate with Japan's steps in implementing the new policy, then it is related to the fact that the people do not understand the National Government's politics and, at the same time, do not understand Japan's new policy toward China." Now, four years have passed, have these two major missions been completed? Or to what extent have they been completed? Today, while we celebrate, we should also reflect on them in a practical way!</p>
<p>What is the prerequisite for the National Government's politics to cooperate? It is the "reform of politics" that we have consistently advocated. And the prerequisites for reforming politics are, first, to establish expert politics, and second, to establish popular representative institutions. Expert politics includes a government of good people and clean politics. Thus, on the one hand, we should eliminate corruption, purify officialdom, build a government of good people, and establish clean politics; on the other hand, we should rigorously implement the examination and selection system, adopt meritocracy, avoid nepotism and favoritism, and establish expert politics. Secondly, the unreasonable phenomena in national politics may be "a muddle to those in charge" subjectively, but the people are "clear observers" objectively. Therefore, by establishing popular representative institutions, the people can point out the gains and losses and correct unreasonable phenomena from a clear, objective perspective.</p>
<p>Today, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, we respectfully and sincerely reiterate the four words "reform politics" as a gift for the celebration. By this time next year, on the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, we hope to have completed the reform of politics in fact and at the same time completed the two major missions mentioned above!</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Launch Interception War in Northwestern Region of Myitkyina; Central Route Advances Toward Imphal Plain</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced the following war situation in Burma at 5:20 PM on the 28th: Japanese troops in northern Burma are currently intercepting two divisions of the reorganized First Army of the Chongqing Army and approximately two brigades of British and American Allied forces invading from the Tanggon area in the northwestern region of Myitkyina and are compressing the encirclement of enemy airborne supply units that landed near Gasa. Japanese troops on the central border of India and Burma are continuing to attack the main force of the British Indian 4th Corps, which is surrounded, near Chin Hills and the Kabaw Valley and are advancing toward the Imphal Plain with their main force. Japanese troops on the border of India and Burma, after annihilating the main force of the British Indian 7th Division, are countering the main force of the British Indian 15th Corps that has advanced to that area. At the same time, they are attacking the 81st Division in the western area of the Kaladan River Valley, and the progress of the war is extremely smooth.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 29th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese army fighter squadron attacked enemy airborne commando units that landed east of Mani Kano Road on the 26th. The enemy units have been surrounded by Japanese ground troops, and the Japanese fighter squadron is fiercely strafing them and, at the same time, raided enemy airfields, completely destroying 55 small enemy transport planes that were landing. The Japanese planes have safely returned to base.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 29th (Central News Agency) - Elite units of the Japanese army air force in Burma, responding to the Japanese troops on the northern Burmese-Indian border, boldly dispatched on the 26th, repeatedly strafed and bombed the remnants of the British 17th Division, which had been defeated north of Donzain and surrounded by Japanese and Indian troops, destroying their vehicle formations, and smashing their dense formations, inflicting a great blow. The entire squadron safely returned to base.</p>
<p>Imphal, 28th (Central News Agency) - The enemy army is eager to reopen the Chongqing-India Highway. On the 5th and 6th of this month, two thousand people attempted to counterattack northern Burma. The Japanese troops, Burmese National Army, and Burmese civilians in that area surrounded the enemy landing troops, blockaded their movements, and continued to fiercely attack them, having captured and annihilated most of them. The remnants of the enemy army that had infiltrated the dense forests are currently being mopped up. The enemy army's attempt to reverse the decline has now become a mere dream.</p>
<h3>Paratroopers Near Gasa Partially Annihilated; Enemy in the South Also Suffers Heavy Blows</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 28th that the Japanese army has launched a fierce annihilating operation against the British, American, and Chongqing armies on the 1,000-plus kilometer Burmese border line from the Fugong area in northern Burma to the Bay of Bengal. The Japanese army's operations in that area are proceeding extremely smoothly, and the enemy army has now largely fallen into a state of chaos, scattering and fleeing. The situation in various areas is as follows:</p>
<h3>Northern Burma and India</h3>
<p>The Chongqing-American army's New First Army under the command of American General Stilwell and the two brigades formed by the British and Americans on the northern border of India and Burma are quite perplexed by the task of opening the Ledo Road. Although they have repeatedly counterattacked in the Tanggon area, they have been lured by the Japanese army's skillful tactics to the mountainous areas northwest of Myitkyina and encircled, so they have suffered heavy losses. The Chongqing army in that area, although equipped with excellent American equipment and commanded by American officers, is difficult to utilize its machinery due to terrain obstacles. At the same time, it has been heavily damaged by the skillful attacks of the Japanese army. In recent days, a large number of Chongqing army tanks have been destroyed by the Japanese army's artillery and cannons, and the Chongqing infantry units that were covering the tanks have been mostly annihilated, which can be described as a crushing defeat. In addition, an enemy glider unit of about 5,000 people, carrying light and heavy mortars and machine guns, landed near Gasa in the upper reaches of the Irrawaddy River, intending to echo the enemy forces in the Fugong area and disrupt the Japanese army's rear, but after being encircled by the Japanese army and the Burmese army, a part of it has been annihilated, and the remnants are currently being mopped up.</p>
<h3>Central Border</h3>
<p>In the central India-Burma border area, the Japanese army is besieging and fiercely attacking the main forces of the British Indian 4th Corps, the 17th and 20th Divisions, at Chin Hills and the mouth of the Kabaw Valley, further intensifying the annihilating war. At the same time, the elite main force of the Japanese army and the Indian National Army, with mechanized units as the vanguard, using more than a thousand captured vehicles, continued to advance toward the Imphal Plain, but before the large Japanese army advanced into the Imphal Plain, it was already in a state of chaos. Regarding the war situation on the central India-Burma border, according to a Chongqing broadcast report, after the Japanese army pushed into the Imphal Plain, Stilwell's army's supply line in the Fugong area was not only cut off, but also the supply to the American air force stationed in Chongqing was also in danger of being interrupted. This has already shown a glimpse of the plight of the enemy camp before the Japanese army's crushing advance.</p>
<h3>Southern Area</h3>
<p>In the southern India-Burma border area, after the Japanese army annihilated the British Indian 7th Division in February of this year, the enemy suffered heavy losses in the first Arakan disaster. Afterwards, they sent the 26th Division to advance to Buthidaung, trying to break through the Japanese army's front. At the same time, the powerful Japanese army transferred tank units, heavy artillery, and other new troops to the front line. The enemy is actively trying to break through the Japanese army's defenses in the southern India-Burma border, but it has suffered a major blow from the Japanese army. The progress of the war situation in the Imphal area has recently become unstable. In addition, the Japanese army is currently launching an annihilating war against each division of the West African forces advancing into the Kaladan River Valley, which is proceeding extremely smoothly. The annihilating war in the northern border area is now only a matter of time.</p>
<h3>Bombing of Tiddim</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Burma-India front, the Japanese tank units are intensifying the annihilation war against the 20th Division of the enemy, which is stubbornly resisting on the solid cold defense line around Tiddim. By the morning of the 22nd, they had reached the enemy airfield 1.5 kilometers south of Tiddim, setting three enemy planes on fire and completely occupying it. At the same time, the activity of the enemy air force in the Kabaw Valley was also completely controlled. In addition, on the 26th, the Japanese assault troops northwest of Tiddim launched a fierce attack on the enemy army, which was moving west from the Tiddim direction with 1,000 vehicles and 20 tanks, inflicting heavy losses. In addition, the city of Tiddim has fallen under the fierce fire of the Japanese army, causing fires in several places, so the fate of the main force of the enemy's 20th Division is becoming increasingly bleak.</p>
<h3>Philippine Service Corps Reorganized into Political Party</h3>
<p>Manila, 29th (Central News Agency) - The New Philippine Service Corps was established on December 8th, 1941. The corps is an organization that encourages the people to achieve the goal of independence. Afterwards, it immediately engaged in both military and political activities, and after the Philippines achieved independence, the corps became the only liaison organization between the Philippine government and the people, and advanced towards the construction of the republic. Recently, in order to adapt to the new situation after independence, the headquarters of the corps decided to reorganize itself from a national movement body into the only officially recognized political party in the Philippines, so as to form an organization to promote national policy. Before and after the independence of the Philippines, the corps participated in the election of independent preparatory committee members and members of Congress, so it had already been assigned the task of a political party. After the independence of the Philippines, the governors and mayors of the states who were members of Congress also concurrently served as the local administrative heads of the corps. Currently, the number of members has exceeded 1.04 million, so after the corps is reorganized into a single political party this time, it will establish a tripartite relationship with the government and Congress, and can devote more effort to the construction of the republic.</p>
<h3>The Great East Asia War and the Mission of China and Japan - Ambassador Tani's Speech at the Party Training Corps</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - Ambassador Tani went to the Central Party Headquarters' Central Party Affairs Training Corps at 3:00 PM on the 22nd and gave a speech entitled "The Great East Asia War and the Mission of China and Japan" for an hour, explaining the significance of the Great East Asia War in great detail. The original text is recorded as follows: Since the Washington and London Naval Disarmament Conferences, Japan has been working hard to maintain world peace, but Britain and the United States have dreamed of conquering the world and have often oppressed Japan in order to achieve their ambitions. However, Japan, in order to seek world peace, has been tolerant and engaged in negotiations with the United States, but the United States still has no reflection. In order to open up the destiny of the nation, Japan resolutely rose up and fought. The Japanese soldiers bravely and skillfully fought and won great victories, and are still continuing to advance towards the common ideal of liberating East Asia and building a new order.</p>
<p>In addition, the allied countries of Germany and Italy have risen up to open up the destiny of the nation, and have also won great victories since the start of the war, and have built a new order with various European allied countries, achieving brilliant results. This is a well-known fact. Although Germany is currently forced to carry out a bloody attrition strategy on the Eastern Front, on the other hand, withdrawing the North African front and shortening its unnecessary fronts can strengthen the European fortress, so Britain and the United States are now facing difficulties on the Italian front. The so-called second front is quite difficult to achieve. After gaining some strength in the Mediterranean, Britain and the United States attempted to launch a major offensive on the Pacific front, but in the overall situation, as a result of the great defeat on the Burmese front, it has turned into an empty dream, so their resistance to Japan is gradually showing anxiety and panic.</p>
<h3>China Completes Autonomy</h3>
<p>China and Japan have a relationship like lips and teeth, and have various exchanges in terms of ethnicity and history, but in the past hundred years, after the hegemonic doctrine of Britain and the United States flowed into China, their schemes caused the two countries of China and Japan, who share the same culture and ethnicity, to fight each other. However, since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the power of Britain and the United States in China has been completely swept away, and China has been able to return to its original state. Therefore, since January 9th of last year, the Japanese government has handed over concessions and embassy areas in the political field, improved the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and further implemented the fundamental reform of the basic treaty, so that China and Japan can cooperate with each other in their original posture and move towards the path of war. In the economic field, the transfer of new and old enemy properties, the reorganization of various companies, and other economic cooperation are being used to develop the Chinese economy and improve its autonomy. The same measures are also being taken in the cultural field. The various measures mentioned above are all manifestations of the righteous policy of Japan hoping that China will complete its autonomy and independence.</p>
<h3>Realize True Peace</h3>
<p>The peace of Great East Asia is achieved by each country in Great East Asia bringing its own characteristics into play. It is maintained by the principle of consolidation, mutual benefit, and equality in each country that promotes its autonomy, so that the war can be completed and the co-prosperity sphere can be completed. Therefore, the righteous policy adopted by Japan towards China can naturally be adopted towards other countries in Great East Asia, so the Great East Asia Joint Declaration was established, which is known to everyone. What the Japanese government seeks from China, as shown in the Allied Treaty, is the cooperation of all Great East Asia for construction, which is also for China's own revival and development. When the Great East Asia War is at a time of advance and retreat, the hope for a bright future is also deeply in mind, so at this rare opportunity, every citizen must thoroughly understand the current situation and implement Sino-Japanese cooperation. Based on the Great East Asia Declaration, we must move towards the path of Great East Asia construction, and first implement the correct peace of Great East Asia, and look forward to the early realization of the light of the East.</p>

<h3>Memorial Broadcast Speech by Dean Chen on the National Government's Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – The 29th marked the fifth day of the special broadcast speeches commemorating the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, organized by the Propaganda Department. From 9:00 PM to 9:30 PM that evening, Legislative Yuan President Chen Gongbo delivered a broadcast speech titled "The Significance of Returning to the Capital and Current Work." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, tomorrow marks the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. I would like to reiterate the significance of returning to the capital and our current work to you, my dear compatriots. The primary goal and most significant meaning of the National Government's return to the capital lie in seeking comprehensive peace. Therefore, at the beginning of the return to the capital, "peace, anti-communism, and nation-building" were proposed as the National Government's national policy. Our desire for comprehensive peace remains unwavering, and our efforts to achieve comprehensive peace continue unabated. However, the peace we seek is by no means a peace of temporary ease and security. Therefore, at the initial return to the capital, the slogan of "permanent peace" was put forward. Nor do we seek unequal peace. Therefore, when the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty was signed at the end of the 29th year, it was proposed that Japan should continuously and voluntarily revise the established relations, and China should also continuously and voluntarily improve future relations. Until the establishment of the alliance treaty with Japan at the end of last year, our aspiration was fulfilled. From this, it can be seen that we have spared no effort to achieve the permanent peace and equal peace we initially envisioned, which we can say to the country, to the people, and to ourselves. Today, four years have passed since the National Government returned to the capital, and comprehensive peace has not yet been realized, which we deeply regret. However, our sincere heart has never changed for a single day, and our efforts have never slackened for a single day. This can be told to the whole country, not only seeking peace for China, seeking peace for China and Japan, but also seeking genuine peace for the entire East Asia. Therefore, on January 9th of last year, we announced our participation in the Greater East Asia War. This participation in the war was entirely based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism and his last words of uniting with the world's nations that treat us equally to jointly strive forward. Moreover, we deeply felt that the existence of imperialism in Asia would inevitably lead to a lack of peace, and the existence of colonies would also lead to a lack of peace. Therefore, at the moment Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, we immediately decided to participate. After a year of preparation, it was finally realized, which shows that the meaning of the peace we advocate is by no means temporary but far-reaching, and it is not local but vast. The so-called comprehensive peace does not only refer to China but to the entire Asia.</p>
<h3>Current Important Work</h3>
<p>Since the significance of the National Government's return to the capital has already been clarified, I can now proceed to describe our current work. At the beginning of this year, the Chairman instructed us that the work from now on is to rectify thinking, ensure security, and increase production. These three aspects are to establish the foundation for nation-building on the one hand and to complete the Greater East Asia War on the other. The so-called rectifying thinking currently strengthens the New National Movement, ensuring that every citizen can sweep away defeatist thoughts and move forward, eliminate individualism, and move towards national collectivism, eliminate liberalism, and move towards national capitalism, expand narrow nationalism, and move towards national groupism. Regarding drugs that harm the body and mind, we will spare no effort to eliminate them completely with the strength of the nation and the people. Regarding the bad customs that hinder society, we will emphasize them strongly and eliminate them completely.</p>
<p>Regarding increasing production, we acknowledge that it is not just a technical problem but a general responsibility and organizational problem for the people. In the future, our efforts should move towards this new direction. In the past year, the government has also made great efforts to suppress prices and crack down on speculation and hoarding, but it has always recognized that suppressing prices must focus on increasing production. In the future, we will strengthen the national agricultural agencies and local rural organizations to increase agricultural products. Moreover, the Central Reserve Bank has prepared 100 million yuan in funds to lend to factories related to people's livelihood and military needs at a low interest rate of 1%, in order to increase industrial products. Currently, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are studying specific lending and support plans. In the past, we also knew that the crackdown and restriction on the movement of goods inevitably caused obstacles and difficulties in the circulation of goods. We are now studying how to make it smooth and correct any obstacles separately. In this way, I firmly believe that there will be great effects on increasing production and suppressing prices.</p>
<p>Regarding ensuring security, there is already a considerable foundation for military construction. In the future, we should devote ourselves to training troops and improving the lives of soldiers to meet the requirements of security. In the past, the Clearing the Countryside movement has achieved considerable results in various places. In the future, we should further reform the agencies so that the security agencies in various places become a unified and effective enforcement agency, ensuring that people can live in peace and work happily. On the one hand, we establish the scale of autonomy. On the one hand, we concentrate all our efforts to achieve victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to solemnly tell you, dear compatriots. Advocating integrity and eliminating corruption have always been the National Government's established policy since returning to the capital. The severe punishment of food fraud has given the people a deep belief in the government's determination to purify officialdom. I also know that the people are very excited about the government's determination this time. But I want to tell you that this time, the government should not take it as an exciting thing but as a very unfortunate thing for the country. In recent years, the government has been exhausted in comforting and appeasing refugees. Therefore, it is inevitable that officials have been treated with leniency and preferential treatment, which often leads to a failure to prevent crimes and indulgence in crimes. When the crimes are unforgivable, the laws are clearly enforced. This group of corrupt officials deserves to be punished according to the law. The government cannot shirk its responsibility for failing to prevent and cultivate crime in advance. We should blame ourselves for this with a spirit of self-reproach. I deeply hope that all authorities in the future will be stricter with themselves and more lenient with others, and they should not only focus on severely punishing crimes after they occur. They should especially focus on preventing crimes before they occur. Do not indulge them first and punish them later. Punishing one person for a crime only brings temporary satisfaction, but the suffering of the people has long been unbearable. In this way, on the one hand, the vitality of the country and society can be preserved, and on the other hand, politics can achieve great justice and clarity. Today, at the time of starting anew with the people, I do not hesitate to solemnly reiterate the government's original intention.</p>
<h3>Congratulatory Message from the Ambassador of Manchukuo - Announcement of the Completion and Publication of Essay Competition Judging</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Today is the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. Manchukuo Ambassador Lü Ronghuan specially issued a congratulatory message, the main points of which are: The National Government's return to Nanjing has been four years in the blink of an eye. Thanks to the exemplary leadership and arduous efforts of the Supreme Leader Chairman Wang Jingwei, his indomitable spirit is truly admirable and touching. Last year, on October 30th, the alliance treaty was concluded with Japan, and on November 3rd, it participated in the Greater East Asia Conference and issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration in Tokyo, laying the foundation for eternal amity and unity in East Asia. Thus, China's position in the international community has become increasingly consolidated. Currently, the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage. The final victory will surely be in our hands, and the peace of the overall situation will surely be realized. On this memorial day, I not only congratulate the National Government but also congratulate the bright future of East Asia.</p>

<h3>Graduation Ceremony of the First Class of the Party Training Corps - President Chen Delivers a Speech on Behalf of Chairman Wang, Who is Concurrently the Head of the Corps</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – The first class of trainees of the Party Affairs Workers Training Corps has completed its training. At 10:00 AM yesterday (29th), a graduation ceremony was held in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters. Members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees Lin Baisheng, Chen Qun, Peng Nian, Xu Suzhou, Ye Peng, Bao Wenyue (represented by Zhou Zheng), Chen Jicheng, Ma Dianru, Li Fuyi, Chen Changzu, Yang Jie, Wang Manyun, Li Wenbin, Li Kaichen, and Cheng Zhongkuang, as well as various working comrades from the departments, offices, and secretariats of the Central Party Headquarters, and more than 100 trainees, attended the ceremony, which was presided over by Director Chen and Deputy Director Dai of the Corps' Education Department.

All the trainees were greatly encouraged after listening. Then, the trainee representative delivered a speech, and finally, Director Chen presented diplomas and certificates of merit. After taking photos, the ceremony was completed in the resounding sound of military music.</p>
<h3>Speech by the Head of the Corps</h3>
<p>Today is the graduation of the first class of trainees of the Central Party Affairs Workers Training Corps. The head of the corps is unable to attend the speech in person due to incomplete recovery from illness. I would like to write down a few points for the comrades:</p>
<p>Since the Sixth National Congress of the Party, the slogan of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building has been called, and the process of the National Revolution has entered a new stage. Following this, the Greater East Asia War broke out, followed by the National Government's implementation of participation in the war, to save the establishment of the Sino-Japanese alliance, which not only laid the foundation for the permanent friendship of the countries of the Greater East Asia but also laid the foundation for the permanent peace of the world. The Party is the mother body of the National Government. Today, when the National Government is shouldering epoch-making major tasks, how should the party members of the Party redouble their efforts? Uphold the spirit of "leading the people and being the vanguard of the people," and take things before the heavens. Be the first to take the risk, and be the first to take the difficult task. It must be known that the power of a party member's individual identity to mobilize the masses and advocate the atmosphere is greater than mutual persuasion and greater than coercive orders. Therefore, future party members cannot regard themselves as superior to the masses, and future party departments cannot be compared with the government. Party members should go deep into the people to persuade, and party departments should assist the government. In the past, party members were bureaucrats, and party departments were government offices. The rulers were suspected of having a dual leadership, and the masses felt at a loss as to what to do. Such accumulated habits must be completely eradicated. In today's new era, the new spirit of all party comrades must be revitalized in order to break through new obstacles and complete new missions. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Soviet Offensive on the Banks of the Prut River Obstructed - Germany Announces Withdrawal from Nikolaev</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Haitian News Agency reported that responsible officials here stated that German troops have withdrawn from Nikolaev (northeast of Medisa) and the bridgehead on the east bank of the Dnieper River. All military equipment was destroyed before the withdrawal, and all troops and materials were withdrawn.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Haitian News Agency reported that Soviet troops between the Homburg River and the Bug front in the central section of the southern route. From Transnistria to Galicia, heavy pressure continued, but due to the continuous bombing of German aircraft, the Soviet offensive began to slacken. The German-Romanian joint forces are still firmly defending every stronghold in the Balti-Kishinev area. At the same time, the rearguard of the German troops in the area is also responsible for covering the German troops' retreat from the Prut River to new positions. Although the vanguard of the Soviet army has reached the Prut River, it has not yet crossed the river. The German army launched a flanking attack on the Soviet army and engaged in fierce battles between northern Galicia, the Dniester, and the Prut River. Soviet troops launched a two-pronged attack southward between Ternopol and Boroskolov. The troops in Kamenets-Podolsk are also being contained. The defenders of Boroskolov, fearing the danger of being encircled, have begun to retreat to the southeast, and the rearguard is fighting fiercely with them. The German troops there are gradually retreating to the Dniester to make contact with neighboring friendly forces. The obstacle terrain south of Nikolaev and Berdyansk is in good condition, and the Soviet army has also admitted its offensive failure and has abandoned its attempt to cross the Lower Bug River. The Soviet army's attempt to advance southward from Berdyansk-Balta and threaten the flank of the German position has also been thwarted in recent days. The German troops defending the southern part of the Lower Bug River are strictly resisting the Soviet army advancing along the Black Sea. The German army's counterattack north of the Homburg River has been obstructed to advance towards Lvov (Lemberg). The vanguard of the Soviet army between Dubno and Kovel has also been obstructed and fierce fighting for Kovel has begun.</p>

<h3>Mayor Chen's Remarks on the Fourth Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital - Working Together to Build a New Shanghai</h3>
<p>Four years have passed since the National Government's return to the capital. As the Greater East Asia War enters a decisive stage, the whole country is becoming more and more motivated. A Central News Agency reporter believed that it was especially important to commemorate this historic anniversary after the recovery of the Shanghai concessions. He specially interviewed Mayor Chen, who gave the following remarks:</p>
<h3>The Chinese Nation Will Surely Obtain Light</h3>
<p>Four years have passed since the National Government's return to the capital. Looking back on the changes in the East Asian situation over the past four years, they have been extremely rapid. Fortunately, the central authorities have adhered to the original intention of returning to the capital, overcome all difficulties, and spared no effort. The policy guidelines of adjusting foreign relations, renewing politics, ensuring security, unifying currency, and strengthening economic construction have been reiterated and gradually implemented. Such gains are enough to tell the people. Since the Greater East Asia War entered its second year, the National Government, in cooperation with its allies, swept away the brutality of Britain and the United States in order to seek China's restoration and East Asia's liberation. On January 9th of last year, it resolutely declared war on the enemy countries Britain and the United States. At this point, the relationship between China and Japan has become increasingly harmonious, and China's wartime system has gradually been established. On November 6th of the same year, the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration further ensured the unity of the East Asian nations, and the heroic and vigorous efforts of the allied forces on the front line have repeatedly dealt blows to the enemy. In recent years, good news has been frequently reported, and the people are very excited, and they have redoubled their efforts in following the national policy, promoting increased production, eliminating opium and gambling, and eradicating corruption. This not only symbolizes that the Chinese nation will surely obtain light, but also proves that the East Asian countries will surely be liberated.</p>
<h3>Municipal Administration is Proceeding Smoothly</h3>
<p>As far as this city is concerned, since I was ordered to govern Shanghai, it has been more than three years in a blink of an eye. There have been no amazing achievements, but in this short period of time, I have also been determined to improve the people's food, security, transportation, and education. By August of last year, with the cooperation of the allies, all public and special concessions were recovered one after another, and the extraterritoriality of various countries in China was also completely abolished. Shanghai, which had suffered from the unequal treaties for a century, was fortunately liberated today. In February of this year, the original administrative boundaries were eliminated, and the deformed status quo was adjusted. At this point, the administration of this city was unified. With the assistance of people from all walks of life in this city, the municipal administration is proceeding smoothly. The most difficult task recently, suppressing prices, has also achieved good results. However, although I have achieved some gains, I still dare not be complacent. I can only continue to work hard and realize the policy guidelines as soon as possible, and complete the municipal construction as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Strive to Increase Production and Eliminate Corruption</h3>
<p>Today's Shanghai administration is following the instructions of the National Government, taking the efforts to increase production, ban opium and gambling, and eliminate corruption as urgent tasks. The increase in production is hindered during wartime. Due to the lack of raw materials, production in this city has decreased sharply. Although we have tried repeatedly, we have not been able to break through the difficulties. Recently, there have been some solutions to the raw materials problem, and whether the increase in power supply and the reduction of interest rates on bank loans will provide assistance to the increase in production, the production problem in this city may be expected to be effective gradually. Regarding the elimination of opium and gambling, since the National Government promulgated the outline of the opium ban measures and the regulations on the administration of narcotics, and decided to implement them today, the work of prohibiting drugs has been actively promoted. This government has already issued a ban on gambling dens in this city, and will close them all today. After the opium and gambling are banned, the people of Shanghai should find proper entertainment to strengthen their bodies and minds and devote themselves to their own work. As for eliminating corruption, it is the clean government that I have always advocated. Before the Northern Expedition, when I was in Guangdong, I had followed Chairman Wang to actively advocate it. After the National Government's return to the capital, I wrote articles to advocate it again. At that time, it was said that if clean government could not be established, the goal of peaceful nation-building could not be achieved. Today, we can further say that if clean government cannot be established, the goal of building a new Shanghai and reviving China can never be realized. Recently, the central government has severely investigated corrupt officials, and the special court has strictly enforced the law, which shows that the government is determined. This government often follows the intentions of the central government, earnestly implements them, and strives to take clean government as the starting point to achieve the goal of building a new Shanghai. However, any administration by the government must rely on the cooperation of the people. This is the case on weekdays, and it is even more so during wartime. In the future, I still hope to work closely with the citizens, work together, and strive for the realization of the construction of a new Shanghai and the completion of the revival of a new China.</p>

<h3>Japan's War Against India and Burma Making Extremely Favorable Progress; Japanese Army Press Department Reviews the War Situation</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army Press Department stationed in Shanghai held a routine meeting with the city's Chinese journalist group at the Hua Mao Hotel on the eighth floor yesterday at 3 p.m. Mr. Akari gave an impromptu speech on the war situation in India and Burma as follows:</p>
<h3>Vigorously Advancing, Like Splitting Bamboo</h3>
<p>It is even more meaningful for us to review the military development situation in Burma and India before the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to liberate the East Asian peoples and establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in order to promote the realization of Pan-Asianism. This has been fully stated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, but how can we achieve this noble goal? Undoubtedly, we must strive for it through war. We have already witnessed the independence and liberation of the two major ethnic groups of Burma and the Philippines, and furthermore, the independence and liberation of the 300 million people of India. This is not just empty talk, but a concrete expression of facts. We have seen the announcement by the Omori camp yesterday regarding the situation in Burma, which is developing in a very favorable manner. In particular, on the central Indian-Burmese border, the Japanese army and the Indian National Army are fighting side by side, with mechanized units as the vanguard, fiercely advancing along the Tagaung and Imphal roads, like splitting bamboo. They are only ten kilometers away from the Indian-Burmese border and only ninety kilometers away from the enemy's positions based in the Imphal ruins. The Indian National Army's breakthrough of the border has had a tremendous impact on its homeland. As a result, under the independent tricolor flag of the Indian National Army, the number of people surrendering is increasing daily. Wherever the unit goes, it is restored and becomes territory of the Indian Provisional Government, which proves that the liberation and glorious independence of the Indian nation is actively unfolding in reality.</p>
<h3>Driving Out the Aggressive Forces of Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>In other words, the advance of the Indian National Army is a manifestation of the withdrawal of the aggressive forces of British Imperialism, starting from the Indian side. From the perspective of the 300 million Indian people hoping for independence, it can also be said to be their natural inclination. The attack on India is, so to speak, an unfortunate fratricidal conflict in Greater East Asia, but in fact, it is not targeting the Indian army. Its goal is to drive out the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States. We cannot immediately assume that the Indian National Army's attack on its homeland is proceeding on a smooth road, because the war there is greatly related to the war in Europe with Germany. In an indirect way, it also has significant meaning, because if Britain loses India, it will not be able to continue fighting in Europe. Therefore, Britain cannot ignore the crisis in India and open a second front in Europe. We can also confidently say that once the crisis on the European battlefield becomes very pressing, it will certainly have a considerable restraint on the East. The enemy once constructed Imphal as a base for the British army in the "Kingdom of Manipur," so the front-line enemies of the Japanese and Indian armies are the British 14th Division. If we look at the reactions of the United States or Chongqing, we can understand how panicked the enemy was about the advance of the Japanese and Indian armies on Imphal.</p>
<h3>Enemy Emphasizes Japanese Army's Attack on India</h3>
<p>I will now list several examples below: Reuters, New York, 24th: "The news of the Japanese army's attack on India has been published on the front pages of New York newspapers for days, in a very prominent position. Especially in the post offices there, the news of the Allied forces' disastrous defeat in India is widely circulated. Therefore, the military commentator of the New York Times, Mr. Eldredge, said: "The Japanese army's attack on India is seizing a very good opportunity, and it has full certainty in terms of land and politics." Therefore, NBC Radio in New York broadcasted on the 27th regarding the attack on India, saying that the Allied forces have now encountered a second Singapore situation. The Japanese army's attack on India is more serious than generally imagined. Once the Japanese army reaches Imphal, the Allied forces' vast military supply stations will be completely cut off, and the New Guanshan Highway leading to Chongqing will also lose its value. Furthermore, according to the London Times on the 24th, if the Japanese army's operations are only partially successful, the Allied forces in the entire hilly area will have no choice but to withdraw. In addition, the New York Times correspondent in Chongqing, Mr. Mazar, cabled on the 25th: "The general public in Chongqing are deeply worried and distressed. They believe that the last lifeline of Chongqing will be cut off soon, so they cannot regard this current crisis as trivial." Due to the above-mentioned unrest, it has even affected the value of Indian currency, causing the rupee, which has always been of high value, to suddenly plummet.</p>
<h3>Cloth Merchants and Wholesalers Organize a Joint Operating Office with a Total Capital of 100 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Regarding the centralized allocation of cotton cloth, the Bureau of Commerce and Industry has instructed the Shanghai Special City Cloth Merchants Association to organize a joint operating office with all wholesale members, under the guidance of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, to handle the allocation of cotton cloth to retailers and other designated allocation matters. Currently, the association has drafted the articles of association for the Shanghai Special City Cloth Merchants and Wholesalers Joint Operating Office and submitted them to the Bureau of Commerce and Industry for approval and organization. The Bureau of Commerce and Industry has also appointed preparatory personnel to convene a preparatory meeting, deciding to organize a large-scale registration of members. All wholesalers who joined the Cloth Merchants Association before October of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, before the government announced the Provisional Regulations for the Purchase and Sale of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth, and who declared sales of cotton cloth exceeding 30 bolts, can apply to join the joint operating office as members. The total capital of the office is set at 100 million yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, divided into one million shares, each share worth one hundred yuan, to be subscribed by participating merchants in proportion to the total number of bolts of cloth they applied to sell to the Bureau of Commerce and Industry. Those who sell 30 bolts or more can subscribe to 10 shares, and those who sell less than 30 bolts will not be counted. The internal organization consists of 15 committee members, who form a committee to preside over all affairs. Five standing committee members are elected from the 15 committee members, and a chairman and vice-chairman are elected from the standing committee members. The chairman manages all affairs of the office, the vice-chairman is the external representative, and the standing committee members assist the chairman in handling daily affairs. The Shanghai Special City Cloth Merchants Association serves as the natural supervisor, supervising all business and capital operations. The office has three departments below the committee members: General Affairs, Business, and Finance, to handle various affairs. It is reported that the joint operating office will be officially established in early April.</p>

<p>News reported at 6:20 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>What Must Be Done Now</h3>
<p>The new director of the First District Public Office of this city, Director Wu, stated in his speech yesterday: "The improvement of district administration is certainly the most urgent task, and the rational solution of people's livelihood issues and how to transform social customs are even more fundamental priorities." This opinion is particularly pertinent and concise.</p>
<p>Today's economic predicament in Shanghai lies in the failure to thoroughly adjust people's livelihood issues and the failure to fundamentally reform social customs. Regarding the former, there is a constant shortage of food, constant panic over fuel, the inability to maintain the government price limits for people's daily necessities, and the inability to provide relief to the poor and needy. Robbery of pedestrians and property is widespread at night. Such problems abound. Regarding the latter, there are speculative thoughts such as hoarding and speculation, a decadent atmosphere of indulgence in smoking, gambling, and dancing, and bad habits of extravagance, waste of money, and materials. Such problems are also numerous.</p>
<p>Indeed, we know that the authorities are making their greatest efforts and determination to solve the serious issues of people's livelihood and the bad social customs, but the solutions always seem to be superficial and limited to certain areas. Could it be that the underlying problem has always been that they have the will but lack the power? If that is the case, then what must be done now is to strengthen the power of local administration. Everything related to solving people's livelihood issues and transforming social customs must be done so that "orders are strictly enforced" and thoroughly implemented. This is certainly the shortcut to saving Shanghai's economic crisis.</p>

<p>Special Edition Celebrating the Fourth Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital</p>
<h3>Foreword to the Special Edition</h3>
<p>Today is the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. We are issuing a special edition from a professional standpoint to express our congratulations. However, in order to thoroughly reflect and review the past, address shortcomings, offer suggestions for improvement, and promote reform, we believe that this is the most actively meaningful way to celebrate and commemorate. Based on this idea, we publicly solicited articles from readers earlier this month, with the scope of topics being reform suggestions. We received enthusiastic submissions from readers and selected ten articles. Due to space constraints, we are publishing the first two articles in this special edition. The remaining articles will be published in the April issue of the monthly magazine. We would like to inform you of this.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>— Guo Zhongren</p>
<p>The use of education is great: understanding the general trends of the world and developing a love for the country; understanding mechanical principles and increasing work efficiency; knowing right from wrong and eliminating ignorance; knowing benevolence, justice, morality, and eliminating fraud; enlightening virtue, renewing the people, and reaching the ultimate good—what can be achieved without education! Therefore, countries that stand on firm ground and want to become rich and strong all regard popularizing education and reforming education as the most important tasks.</p>
<p>The lack of popular education in our country is evident throughout the world, with illiterates accounting for more than 80%. Coupled with the corruption of existing education, the results of education are completely wiped out. Looking around today's world, those who ruin the country and harm the people in order to enrich themselves, those who are incompetent and fill positions without merit, and even those who are very muddled-headed and take advantage of opportunities are everywhere. A country with thousands of years of culture is almost like a deep mountain swamp, full of birds and beasts. If we still do not take education seriously, the extinction of the race and the demise of the country will come in the blink of an eye. How can we talk about joining the ranks of powerful countries?</p>
<p>There are two ways to discuss education: educating out-of-school citizens and improving the current education system. In various powerful countries, compulsory education is implemented, so there is no problem of out-of-school citizens. However, our country is different. For decades, we have only been engaged in war. Those in high positions in the morning may not be settled by evening. With five-day mayors, who will reform the education system? The education system is generally formulated by a few students who have studied abroad. Many of them do not conform to the national conditions and cannot be compared to the natural development of the country. This point cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>Our country has never had compulsory education. Poor families do not know the importance of education, and the burden is extremely heavy. Young children of seven or eight years old are relied upon to work to supplement the family's income. How can they have time to study? For the current plan, we should set up compulsory education schools for out-of-school citizens so that they can have the opportunity to receive education again. Then the foolish will become upright and the fraudulent will become wise. This is not an unrealistic hope.</p>
<p>The greatest matter is funding, and those who advocate it must take this into account. I believe that the site of the compulsory schools can immediately use existing schools, because existing schools are often empty at night and have nothing to do. Compulsory schools can take advantage of this, so there is no conflict. Desks and chairs in classrooms are not distracting. Studying at night does not conflict with working during the day. This can save money. Classrooms, etc., can be filled by students of various levels. If it is not enough, then recruit enthusiastic people. I think it should not be a problem. As for books, stationery, and utensils, it is the government's responsibility to bear half of the cost, and the people should not refuse to donate half. Then the economic difficulties can be slightly alleviated. As for the duration of education, I think it can be temporarily set at three years. After the success of the program and the gradual enrichment of the national treasury, it can be extended. This is certainly possible. The teaching materials should be practical and simple, and can be filled with the national language, common sense, and arithmetic.</p>
<p>We should also use the baojia system to establish these schools. If there are many illiterates in a joint bao, then set up a joint bao compulsory school. If there are fewer, then several bao can be combined to set up a joint bao school. Then the effectiveness can be further increased.</p>
<h3>Continuing Education Schools</h3>
<p>The above discussion is about compulsory education, that is, everyone must be forced to receive instruction. Above this is the primary continuing education school. Anyone who graduates from compulsory school and aspires to further study can enter. At this time, the country can decide whether it is compulsory education based on its financial resources. If the economy is exhausted, then primary continuing education schools can charge fees to help subsidize them. The classrooms and teachers should make the most of existing schools to save expenses. Those who are easier to set up can enter higher continuing education schools, whose nature is similar to today's continuing education schools, but improved.</p>
<p>Currently, continuing education schools are mostly business-related, followed by foreign language departments. Without these two, they can be called "continuing" schools. We all know the importance of revitalizing industry and the lack of intelligent and skilled agricultural workers, which is enough to affect the improvement of agriculture and industry, and there is no organization to support capable workers. Is this not strange? Therefore, the so-called skilled workers in our country (meaning workers with high work efficiency) have served in factories for many years, and then they are familiar with the work experience and the operation of machinery. They know what to do but do not know why, and they are conservative and unwilling to improve. How can such people meet the ever-increasing needs? The best way to remedy this is to set up morning industrial continuing education schools.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Physical Education</h3>
<p>Today's elementary schools (and middle schools as well) have a much larger number of students than normal due to the special environment. The complexity of the elementary school curriculum also needs to be improved. Taking the second grade of senior elementary school as an example, the books they read include national language, arithmetic, English, abacus, society, nature, and Japanese. Considering the age of the students, they are generally from eleven to thirteen years old. It is doubtful whether such young students can bear such a burden, and whether they understand what they learn is even more questionable. The impact on health is even more serious. I have often seen young children reviewing their lessons, with books on national language, English, and Japanese placed on their desks, like experts. However, when asked about what they have learned, few can answer. This is certainly not enough. The unreasonableness of the school subjects is not only in foreign languages, but also in abacus. What is taught is mostly addition and subtraction, and at most multiplication. From the perspective of self-employed people, it is still practical, but from the perspective of the majority of students who go on to higher education, it is nothing more than that their hopes are not as ideal as they had hoped. This is not only true of elementary schools, but also of middle schools and universities.</p>
<p>There are also problems with the teaching materials. For example, in English, what is taught is classical and literary, which is completely contrary to the needs. Also, in national language and other subjects, the society is advocating the use of vernacular and abolishing classical Chinese, but the teachers are doing the opposite, abandoning vernacular and using classical Chinese. The world is advocating the development of individuality, but the school authorities are still clinging to the old methods of centuries ago, making students write eight-legged essays. All of this must be corrected.</p>
<h3>Secondary Education</h3>
<p>In recent years, secondary schools have tended to specialize in different subjects. However, the most needed agricultural science has not yet been officially established. This is a great regret. The need for agricultural talents is greater than that for industrial talents, because China is an agricultural country, and farmers account for almost 80% of the population. The area of cultivated land is evident throughout the world. However, they are ignorant of insect prevention, fertilizer application, the influence of climate, and the suitability of soil. Therefore, half of the crops are damaged by these factors. The so-called "harvest" is just a remnant of nature! If we prepare for prevention in advance, then with such a large population and such a large land, wealth and strength can be expected. It is not deliberately sensational to say that agricultural talents are more important than workers.</p>
<p>After specialization, one thing must be paid attention to, that is, the restriction of each subject. The Ministry of Education should make a thorough count of the number of vocational personnel, the location of needed talents, and the number of young people in school. Based on the needs and the shortages, it should then stipulate how many people should be in a certain subject and how many people should be in a certain subject. Then, after graduation, individuals will not have the joy of having no place to use their talents, and the society will not have the pain of not having talents to use. Then the industry can progress and the function can be evident.</p>
<p>The method of restriction can also be used in universities. If the Ministry of Education sees that there are too many talents in liberal arts and too few talents in science and engineering, it can order the liberal arts departments to stop enrolling students for one year and increase the number of science and engineering schools. Then the supply and demand will be equal, and the saying that graduation means unemployment will become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Secondly, our current education neglects moral, physical, and social education. What is called education seems to only refer to intellectual education. If you look at the school curriculum, 90% of it is intellectual education, and there is none for moral and social education. Even the one or two physical education classes are regarded as unimportant. Teachers have become insignificant, and students leave and return at will. Physical education has long existed only in name. Is the age of ten not the time to determine health in life? If you do not exercise your body at this time, will you look forward to the next life? Moreover, the body of a sick person is passed down from generation to generation, and this has been the case for thousands of years. If one generation is not strong, it will be even more difficult for future generations to be strong. If we do not abandon the bad habits of thousands of years, then if people do not destroy us, we will destroy ourselves. And if you do not exercise your body when you are young, it will be difficult to succeed even if you work hard. Should schools not pay attention to students' physical education?</p>
<h3>Women's Education</h3>
<p>Looking at women's education, our country and Europe and the United States are equally divided, but the different personalities of women and men cannot be concealed. Since coeducation, the benefits of women receiving education are countless. However, looking at the consequences, most of them are housewives. Receiving education does not help in the slightest. They cannot do housework, nor do they want to do housework. They cannot serve the society, nor can they manage the family. They cannot be like European and American women who enter and leave society, nor can they be like old-fashioned women who sweep and serve the family. Decades of education are just parasites of society and family. All of this is because educators are ignorant of the national conditions and want to make women equal to men. Do you not look at Japan? Their women's education is very different from men's, because they know that wanting to make women equal to men is like saying that the wise must be the same as the foolish. The failure is certainly appropriate. I think women's education should be divided into two types. One is the same as men's, so that they can serve the society. The other is to train them to handle housework, similar to Japan, so that they can manage the family. In this way, they can avoid being broad but lacking essentials, and working hard but achieving little.</p>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p>Finally, there is something about education that must be loudly emphasized: "The Application of the National Language." The barriers of language are enough to divide a country. The previous National Government, aware of this, adopted the Beijing dialect as the national language, explicitly ordering schools to use it in teaching, which proved quite effective. However, with the outbreak of war, supervision was lacking, and a few schools openly defied the order, disregarding it and abandoning it halfway. What a pity! Although urging and advising, with the power of public opinion, is an undeniable duty.</p>
<p>Regarding educators, there are two points that require attention: First, the living conditions of teachers. Unstable living conditions and teaching on an empty stomach are inherently difficult. To achieve a mind free from external disturbances, stable living conditions are essential. I believe that schools, regardless of size, should be organized and managed by the teachers themselves. The sole establishment of a principal inevitably leads to the exploitation of teachers' rights, like a middleman merchant. Otherwise, those who are not principals will not have an advantage, and those who are teachers will face hardship.</p>
<p>The qualifications of teachers must be strict. Filling positions with unqualified individuals is a grave mistake. Japanese primary school teachers may only have the equivalent of a first or second-year high school education in our country, but their primary education results are far superior to ours. Why? Because teachers are highly respected. In our country, a mere diploma is sufficient to become a teacher, leading to many instances of malpractice. I suggest that, like doctors, teachers should be required to pass an examination before being allowed to practice. Perhaps this could slightly reduce the corruption.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Collection Methods of Wartime Consumption Special Tax</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jun</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance of the National Government announced the collection of the National Wartime Consumption Special Tax on January 16th, two months have passed in an instant. The taxable items and tax rates are roughly divided into three categories: retail of goods, banquets and hotels, and entertainment. The first category, retail special tax, stipulates a 10% tax on gold and silver jewelry, antiques, furs, and luxury goods; and a 4% tax on other ordinary goods. The second category, banquet and hotel special tax, includes public restaurants, teahouses, coffee shops, etc., all taxed at 15%. The third category, entertainment consumption special tax, is divided into three categories: A: movies, horse racing, music; B: drama, singing, storytelling, acrobatics; C: other luxury entertainment such as dancing, taxed at 10% to 40%. However, this tax has not yet been levied. Necessities such as rice, coal, and salt are exempt from the tax, and it is stipulated that it is part of the national tax revenue. This tax measure, during wartime, aims to passively restrict national consumption and promote frugality, which is undoubtedly appropriate. Moreover, other countries have similar precedents during wartime, and the general public has no objection to paying the tax. Furthermore, Shanghai has been collecting a 2% retail donation and a bill stamp donation since June of the 31st year of the Republic, so the general public does not perceive it as an excessive tax. However, the collection methods were not detailed and definitive at the time, leading to numerous malpractices over time. Now, without discussing how the three provinces and one city are collecting the tax, based on what the author knows about the Shanghai area, the actual revenue of the tax authority is estimated to be only about 20-30%. 70-80% has already been pocketed by the collectors along the way!</p>
<p>Since February 1st, when the 182 districts were merged, the authorities established a special tax section within the finance department of the district office to specifically collect the consumption special tax. Unfortunately, the collection method follows the precedent of the former Shanghai Municipal Council, where each store submits the tax on its own every month, and then the section sends inspectors to examine each household to see if it matches the total amount of daily retail income. If there is false reporting, strict penalties are imposed. This method seems flawless at first glance, and under the general principle of a sound accounting system, it is appropriate. Formal partnership stores and companies do report every detail without falsely paying the tax. However, in most old-fashioned Chinese ledgers, there are many loopholes! Based on what the author has seen and knows, the following is a brief description:</p>
<h3>The Origin of Cheating</h3>
<p>First: Most small retail stores only have a husband and wife, and hire one or two apprentices. These stores have no accounting equipment at all, and the monthly income can be completely different from the original revenue. Because they only have a very simple record of receipts and payments, the amount of income and expenditure can be entered at their own discretion. For example, small tobacco shops and fried food shops. Furthermore, for larger stores such as grocery stores, candy stores, and department stores, they rarely give customers invoices when they sell goods, and their accounting is in the old-fashioned ledger system. Every day they can casually deduct a certain amount of business income and record it in other accounts, so the tax evasion is extremely obvious. For example, small hotels and restaurants, their daily turnover is also mostly reported as less than the actual amount, because although they issue bills, they rarely have stubs to keep.</p>
<p>Second: The inspectors sent by the special tax section feel it is extremely difficult to audit, because it is almost impossible to investigate some stores, and a few luxury goods stores and restaurants even have two sets of accounting books, one real and one fake. The real account is secretly recorded at night, because the investigators will never come to check at night! For example, a certain clothing store on Shilu Road only pays about four or five thousand yuan in taxes every month, and a candy store only pays three or four thousand yuan. However, a check of their general ledger shows that the monthly expenditure is always between one and two hundred thousand yuan, plus a huge amount of purchase funds. Where does the difference come from? However, they all claim it is wholesale income, but if you carefully check the wholesale return orders and the store numbers and re-examine them, it is not difficult to find loopholes!</p>
<p>Regarding the above two extreme situations, the tax authorities are often confused, unlike the bystanders who are clear and understand. It is estimated that the current special tax revenue is about 50 million yuan per month, which is much higher than the millions of yuan in the past during the Shanghai Municipal Council period and the one or two million yuan last year, and the results are remarkable. However, the increase in tax evasion is difficult to estimate, and the rapid increase in prices far exceeds the increase rate of tax revenue. Since the Lunar New Year, the price index has almost doubled, but this tax revenue has not increased dramatically, so the author can conclude that: except for a few large companies on Nanjing Road and companies with a perfect and honest accounting system, all have more or less suspicion of intercepting tax revenue. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the collection methods as soon as possible so that the taxes paid by the common people with their hard-earned money will not be lost halfway. It is necessary to ensure that every penny goes to the public, so that those who take the opportunity to intercept taxes will restrain themselves and have no way to apply their tricks! The considerations and experiences gained are nothing more than three points.</p>
<h3>Improvement Measures</h3>
<p>First: The Ministry of Finance can issue a kind of consumption special tax ticket, the form of which can be the same as stamp tax stamps, etc., and each store can separately purchase it monthly according to its total sales amount, and when selling goods and collecting taxes, paste it on the invoice together with the stamp tax stamp. If a small retail store does not issue invoices to customers, it can be directly pasted on the wrapping paper of the goods. Then, the store stamps or marks it to cancel the ticket. If it is an item like cigarettes that does not have wrapping paper, it can also be pasted on the cigarette carton. If the invoice or goods do not have tax tickets pasted, the purchaser can refuse to pay the tax. The tax ticket amount can be divided into six types: one hundred yuan, fifty yuan, ten yuan, five yuan, one yuan, and five jiao, and pasted on the invoice or bill according to the amount due.</p>
<p>Second: In order to prevent collusion between stores and buyers to cheat and to encourage each store to actively sell the tax tickets, the special tax collection authority can stipulate that the collecting store will be given a handling fee of 5%, like the handling fee for withholding income tax! That is, the tax ticket can be sold to each collecting store at 95% of its face value! This method does have printing expenses and a 5% commission loss, but the total expenditure is less than 10% of the total tax revenue, which is much more perfect compared to the current loss of 70-80%.</p>
<p>Third: In addition to the above two methods, the investigators still go to each store to check whether the total amount of business revenue is consistent with the amount of tax tickets purchased, and whether there are still fraudulent acts in the existing number of remaining tickets, and report them.</p>
<p>If the above three points are implemented, both the stores and the people will benefit, and all will be happy to comply, and the government's national tax revenue will inevitably increase dramatically. For the Shanghai area alone, it is estimated that it can increase to more than 20 million yuan per month. To remedy the tax system is not a small thing, which is what our people deeply hope for.</p>
