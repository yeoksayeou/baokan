<h3>再爲助學金呼籲</h3>
<p>本報新舊助學生甄別試驗已於上月二十五六日及本月三日陸續完竣，應考的初中小學生五千餘人，高中大學二千餘人，總數共計八千餘人。我們看到這許多學生在考塲上應考，許多護送的家長們在門外等候着，他們拿自己本身的學問成績，公開地求社會上予以求學的機會，環境雖然是極可憐，而他們的志氣卻令人可敬，這個印象太深刻了。</p>
<p>我們常說，人類所以能夠，永久存在，完全靠人類的互助。中華民國所以能夠繼續光大，完全靠中華民國國民的相互掖助。互助心的最大表現，就在「救苦救難」四個字。我要同情人家的苦難，我要設法救濟人家的苦難，這是最偉大的「愛力」，這個「愛力」是凝結國家民族的中心，是中華民國復興的基本因素。</p>
<p>讀者諸君們！現在上海有成千成萬的優秀靑少年，他們己經處在最困苦，最艱難電環境裹，他們更在用自己一點點微小電力量來掙扎。這正是我們一般成年人發揮「愛立」的時候，我們要立刻設法解除他們電苦難，我們要保持下一代的命脈，我們要維護國家的元氣。</p>
<p>在報人的立塲上，我們始終抱定獨立自尊宗旨，我們從不向人求物質上的幫助，金錢的幫助更談不到。可是為了社會公益事業，特別是為了助學事業，至少在近年來巳　樹立了小小的基礎，造成了些微的成績，我們謹敢向讀者請求捐助，我們更願意向社會哀求捐助。從前有個義丐叫做武訓，他為了要使同胞子弟能夠讀書，甚至沿門托缽，向大家募化，三十餘年在山東堂邑，臨淸等鄉村，辦了許多的義塾，救了不少失學的兒童。現在，本報同人都願意做武訓，更希望大家個個都願意做武訓。安心地繳學費，等待入學，這八千多個淸寒究竟能否上學，他們的家長們更一心一意地希冀他們的兒女的被助學金甄別試驗的錄取成績來答報。現在優秀的學業成績已經由考試表現出來了，我們自應該趕快多多捐助，使他們繼續上去，有高深的造就。好花的種子，假如沒有雨露的浸潤，人力的灌溉，種子本身就沒法子生長。我們希望開好花，結佳菓，我們先得要努力灌溉。</p>
<p>在大時代裹，大家都在苦難中，不過大家心裹都存有一個光明的前途，這個前途至少大部份要寄託在下一代的同胞身上，因為我們大家的奮鬥，都要靠下一代的子弟們機續努力下去。我要教育我自己的子弟，使他們將來能夠繼續我的工作，我更要幫助別人去教育他們的子弟，使他們也能夠繼續他們的工作。社會要有互助，然後方有互利。讀者諸君們！道是最好的時機，起來，起來，讓我們攜着手共同完成這件偉大的工作。</p>
<h3>日陸海軍政令　再實行分立　最高陣營態勢已完成</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日本小磯新內閣之性格，爲一陸，海軍緊密連擊協力下，舉國邁向完隊戰爭之內閣，故雖極狹意之軍政，軍令分立，鑒於小磯內閣之木質，當然亦在必行之要政，並不僅此，自客觀立塲觀之，戰局日漸深刻，如更將軍政，軍令築中於一人負担，於處理事務方面，當然亦非事賞所許。東條前內閣時，即鑒於此客觀事實，故曾於總辭戰前之七月十八日深夜，將參謀總長一職，讓位於梅津美治郎大將，新內閣當然沿襲前內閣之軍政，軍令分立方針。小礎內閣之木質，自初即專任杉山元帥為陸相，並恢軍大將米內光政氏為海軍大臣，於陸軍方面由杉山元帥，梅津大將分任軍政軍令，海軍方面，則以米內，島田兩大將分別專責。島田大將自東條內閣成立二年九閱月以來，即身為大戰下之海相，且更於今年三月二十二日兼任軍令部總長，其赫赫之功績，時為朝野頌讃。值此陸海軍最高首腦刷新陣容之際，決意讓軍令部總長與前海相及川古志郎大將，島田大將今後則以軍事參議官姿態參與軍機，於此日木陸·海軍政·軍令同時實行再度分立，對處此決戰時局之日軍不動態勢，已行確立，今後對處理激烈繁忙之軍務，由於此次首腦之專任，將見其活躍。小磯內閣之國務新機能，以及日軍期侍之陸·海軍軍政。軍令最高陣營，已行布妥，舉國一致，集中戰力完遂決戰，斷乎粉碎敵人的鐵壁態勢，現已完成。此種鐵壁態勢之確立，殆已表明日本舉國一致之鬥志。</p>

<p>日空軍襲　桂林經過　　中地三日中央社電　淪美空軍前進基地，今己深受日軍不斷威脅，蓋日機述日轟炸其在中國西南之最後反攻據點桂林。柳州。及其機動基地芷江·丹竹·梧州·各地機塲，逐次增大繫滅淪美空軍之戰果。複於一日夜數度轟炸挂林，並出敵不意，實行奇襲，已獲得完全成功，一舉收獲莫大戰果。緣日轟炸機曾於一日下午十時十分，轟炸挂林西南機塲，美空軍於狼狽之餘，乃將停放於滑走路及誘導路上，點有前照燈及冀燈之渝機拖出，及至聞悉日空軍轟炸之前後，即有（P40）型機二架起飛迎戰，當時日機即以此混亂無序之渝機畢為目標，開始轟炸。首批日機炸毀渝大型機三架，小型機四架，使之起火燃燒，嗣更炸毀其大型機一架，小型架五架，繼之第二第三批機，乃以被炸起火焚燒之美機為目標，投彈使戰果益為擴大。此時渝方高射砲陣即開始亂射，但日機仍冒渝軍高射砲彈幕急降，由起低空投彈，卒擊毀美機合計四十四架，使所在之美空軍幾全部潰滅。另一隊日機會於同時奇襲挂林南方機塲，使美機三架起火燃燒，三架受創。計在桂林兩機塲共損害美機計五十架之多，另一隊日機冒渝軍熾烈之高射炮火，轟炸柳州，卒擎毀美機七架。此外另一隊日機會轟炸丹竹，對其偽裝地區作澈底之破壞，其時因天氣黯黑，戰果無從確認云。</p>

<h3>德土外交使節　已分別離任　日人士表明見解</h3>

<p>東京三日中央社電　消息靈通方面，頃對此次德·土絕交事，表明見欐如次：德。土兩國在經濟上，為有無相通之友好國家，於政治方面亦無何等衝突，故絕交一舉，實無合理原因，一言以蔽之，土國此舉，實受英美強壓所致。至於對德國作戰之影響，因過去早已實施對德禁輸軍需物資，故實質上無何變化。對巴爾榦方面，亦可謂無何影響，蓋德國對巴爾幹之軍事準備巳吿成功，即今後士國以國土供給英美使用，亦不至對巴爾幹戰局立刻發生伺種影響。至於今後士國之動態，須視蘇聯之熊度如何而定，土國處於英美蘇三國角逐之間，其困難當可想見。又此次德土絕交，在莊理上無何使日本與土國關係發生樊動之要素，土國亦為亞洲民族，與日本多年友善，今竟屈服於英美壓迫之下，日木對之不勝同情。</p>

<h3>本市戶口米　決定恢復配給　增加配量本月初可實行</h3>
<p>木市戶口米自兩月前停止配給以來，市府當局積極與各方磋商，力求恢復配給，以維民食。茲悉當局經數度磋商，盟邦軍部當局，己允將湘省等產米區米糧大量運滬，以為戶口米配給之用，是以木市戶口米約木月初當可恢復常態。詳細辦法，於日內由物品統配處決定之，本市米價當更趨下落。陳市長特於昨（三）日發表談話如次；</p>
<p>陳市長發表談話</p>
<p>自本市戶口米中止配給以來，已將兩月，行政院前爲調劑京滬兩市民食，曾於本年六月一日頒布京滬兩市民食米措置綱要公佈後，米價非徒不熊抑平，抑且變本加厲，匪狂上漲，一反政府抑平米價之初衷。幸經市府迅施各種緊急處置，米價始吿下游，但較之六月一日以前漲度仍在一倍以上，滬市民食問題之嚴重性，迄未解除。　米價為凡百物價之基本因素，民食如無合理解決辦法，物價問題自難望其解決。盟邦當局對此亦極注意，屢次表示願意協助我國，解決民食問題。經市府迭次磋商，盟邦軍部當局已允將湘省等區產米，大量運滬，以接濟民食之用。本市停止兩月之戶口米團給，於本月初起當可恢復常態，向例每一市民每十日配給食米兩升，此後食米配給，亦可依此辦理，詳細辦法，不日由市府物品配給處決定。當此戰事日益緊急，米糧靑黃不接之際，盟邦當局有此賢明之措置，深為感關。希望本市各界，能體諒當局籌劃民食配給之苦心，一致奮起實行節約增產，協助政府，以求大東亞之勝利·有厚望焉」。</p>
<p>日使館當局談話</p>
<p>盟邦大使館上海事務所當局，關於增加米糧配給事項，發表談話如次：本年六月以來，滬市米價激漲，各物價隨之暴滕，晉迫民衆生活，莫此為甚。木年之麥作豐收，為近年所稀見，禾稻亦因天氣良好，預期可得豐稔。此際日軍最近在湖南作戰，收穫赫赫勝利，其他豐稔之米產地區，已參加和平地區，因之滬市及各地米價，乃逐漸下降，殊可慶賀。關於新作戰地區之收購米糧一事，得日軍密切協力，業已着手工作，大量米糧已可繼續供給，故暫時停止之滬市地區食米配給，現在不僅即將恢復，同時對於小麥粉，雜糧之增加配給，亦可付之實施，想久苦於米價高昂之民衆生活，由此可得轉機。關於今年米統會之攻買米糧，日方一致協力，不惜予以一切援助，刻已着手軍備，期可圖滑敎買新米，而獲得充分之成果。又近來米價及百物暴漲，係受大規模囤積居奇所致，現將重新恢復配給制度，並對於新米樹立完着之收買對策，故此　對於物價高昂，殊有抑制之必耍。當局決定增強取締方針，切望各方積極協力，期可肅淸此種不穩狀態，而使民了生活　於安定。</p>

<p>局長訓詞　陳兼局長在招待各總聯保長各分局長席上訓詞云：我國創行保甲制度，　在數千年前，本「守望相助，疾病相扶持」的互襲保甲遣規，或捨本逐末，或得魚忘笙，北輒南轅，功效疏闊，上海自積極推行保甲制度，一切犯罪暴行，幾於絕迹，租界收回後，更從事保甲之強化，採取中國固有政治制度之優良，參酌時代環境之特點，因勢利導，因時制宜，既不固執成見，亦未隨俗依達，賣施以來，強化民了自衛力量，對於協助維持地方治安，確有</p>
<p>顯著成績　其特色即在於驚保之實行聯業，過去英美勢力籠罩之租界圈內，人民與捕房情既團圈，視同泰越，求其合作談何可能，去年八月為強化警保聯繫，特於本局內設立保甲處，以專責成，制定章則，辦理自瞥，調查戶口，肅淸不良份子，協助政府推行政令，不遺餘力。最近　自奮編組辦法，從事改訂，不久之將來，即成立　本部，即以警局中重要之人員，擔任團木部，各級層之指揮督導工作，如此則警警團團本部各級機構，與警察局各級機滑之運用。換言之，即團木部與總局配合一體，各</p>
<p>官民合作　官方警備力量，與民間自衛木能，沉　一氣，則過去官民隔閡，　視之弊，一切又消弭於無形。糧舊工部局之保甲指導委員會，舊法租界公董局之保甲委員會，依法已不存在，舊前工部局警察署之保甲指導委員會，亦早經停止活動，茲為各級對，溝通聲氣起見，爰於本局組織設保甲委員會各級保甲址諮詢機關，傳民淸得上達於官方，聲　氣求，以保委會爲過渡之橋樑，官方旨趣，與民間意見，乃得為融洽之交流，國立良好的保甲基礎為改進政制之先聲，今上海在警保聯繫原則之下，實施自警制，實為市民自治自衛，自力更生的絕好機會，吾人不能因循錯過。當此非常時期，全靠</p>
<p>大衆一心　，有犧牲小我，共謀羣衆福利的精神，則國家前途，庶未有豸。至於保甲經費之徽收，自未明定辦法，各自為政，各區負責人員，間有因籌墊而遭賠累者，亦有隨意徽收，致啓民了之疑賽者，是以訂定統一收辦法，實屬不容緩，此後凡徵收之經費，以百分之八十，作為各區各項經費之用，百分之二十，作為有全體性的設施之用。從此徽收辦法，既經統一，即可社絕浮收賠塾諸弊，取之於民，用之於民，澈底公開，人民自不致再發生若何疑慮。當此大時代轉變之秋，官民應有風雨同舟之感，協力合作，方能克服艱難，而大東亞於磐石之安。最近</p>
<p>收回廢金　屬運動，關於一般家庭廢金屬之徽集，尤賴保甲各級層協力推進，以盡大東亞戰爭後方貢獻之責任，以薪達民族自強，國家獨立之目電。今後一切大規模的民了運動，均將以保甲為運用的範曉，保田的重要作用，尤在能負書推進一切政令，層遞監督，層　指揮，快幹實幹，使中央省市縣政府的命令，偵正深人民間。蓋了擎易舉，了志成城，一方面可以摒除障碍，一方面可以自衛自治自養自教而外，還要能</p>
<p>順利推進　所以保甲的運用除夠自奮自強，適應時代需要。如物資的配給，增產的鼓勵封鎖限制等等，都須一致努力，一致動員使衰老的保甲制度，返老為童，面月煥然一新。更採取東西會國市政之特長，鎔　陶冶於一爐，日就月將，當可建設一種優良制度，為世界各國所取法，從此保甲更不會是制度上一個名詞，而成為嚴新的一種政治制度。從此保甲更不僅爲廉淸　匪，保障治安的單純作用，而是推行政令，組織民了訓練民衆，使上行下效，一呼百應的新型機構，能使中國民衆漸漸地有團結，有紀律，把愛小我，愛家鄕，愛地方的觀念，擴大而爲愛國，愛東亞的觀念。這種新型政治機構，才是我們理想中的政制，望諸位協力推進，把這理想中的政制實現起來。旋由顧保甲處長，平岡警防處長相繼報吿，對當局之指示，顧協力推進，以達成目的。</p>
<h3>警察總局　强化督察工作　將實施分區督察制</h3>

<h3>林宣傳部長　昨晚廣播</h3>
<p>宜傳部長林柏生氏，日前以要公來滬，於昨（三日）晨九時巡視中央社上海分社，新中國報，申報，新聞報，平報，　氏新聞，並分訪盟邦同盟社及大陸新報，新申報等，茲悉林氏復於昨（三日）晚九時在上海電台向全國靑年廣播，題為「靑年對復興節應有的認識」，對復興節之歷史根據及義意，闊述極為詳盡。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>恢復戶口米配給</h3>
<p>本市戶口來停止配給，已將兩月，現在當局正式表示，不日恢復配給，難特每人每旬兩升。市民對於這一消息，猶之大旱之望雲　，現在居然甘霖下降，自然是值得欣慰的事。</p>
<p>不過，米糧問題的整個獲得解決，是要治本治標兼施的，怎樣標本兼施？我們過去言之已達至矣盡矣的地步。復輿節日，陳市長發表的文意中稅：「南京和上海同是都會，相隔祇有六小時的火車，我偵不解何以南京今日米價在三千元左右，而上海會達至萬元，我想還不止是人謀之不戰，竟直是人謀故意使之不臧。」這對於上海米糧問題所以弄得一團糟糕的癥結，可請慨乎言之了。</p>
<p>所以，我們希望戶口米恢復配給以後，必須準期　是，進一步縮短配給期，增加配給量。同時，特別重視過去失敗的經驗，不蹈覆轍。而欲配給可以源源，絕對仰賴米源的不斷。因此，新殼怎樣收買？價格怎樣規定？都是極關重要的問題，當局雖已表示注意、但是尚夫聞有積極　議。總而言之，負有米糧統制的重大責任者，非加刷新健全，決不能獲得永久安定的。這是我們聽到戶口米恢復配給之後，會先發生的感觸。</p>
<h3>證交限經紀人　提前繳準備金</h3>

<h3>Further Appeal for Scholarships</h3>
<p>The new and returning scholarship student identification tests conducted by this newspaper were successively completed on the 25th and 26th of last month and the 3rd of this month. There were over 5,000 elementary and middle school students, and over 2,000 high school and university students, totaling more than 8,000 participants. We saw so many students taking the tests in the examination halls, and many parents waiting anxiously outside. They were using their own academic achievements to publicly seek opportunities for education from society. Although the circumstances were extremely pitiful, their aspirations were admirable. This impression was deeply etched in our minds.</p>
<p>We often say that humanity's ability to endure permanently relies entirely on mutual assistance. The Republic of China's ability to continue to flourish relies entirely on mutual support among its citizens. The greatest expression of mutual assistance lies in the four words "relieving suffering and rescuing from difficulties." I want to empathize with the suffering of others, and I want to find ways to alleviate their suffering. This is the greatest "power of love." This "power of love" is the center of national and ethnic cohesion and is a fundamental factor in the revival of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Esteemed readers! Currently, in Shanghai, there are tens of thousands of outstanding young people who are already in the most difficult and challenging circumstances. They are struggling with their own meager strength. This is precisely the time for us adults to demonstrate "the power of love." We must immediately find ways to relieve their suffering. We must preserve the lifeblood of the next generation, and we must safeguard the vitality of the nation.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of a newspaper, we have always adhered to the principles of independence and self-respect. We never ask anyone for material help, let alone financial assistance. However, for the sake of social welfare, especially for the cause of scholarships, we have at least established a small foundation and achieved some minor accomplishments in recent years. We dare to ask our readers for donations, and we are even more willing to implore society for donations. In the past, there was a beggar named Wu Xun who, in order to enable the children of his fellow countrymen to study, even went door-to-door begging for alms, raising money to establish many free schools in Tangyi and Linqing and other villages in Shandong for over thirty years, saving many out-of-school children. Now, all of us at this newspaper are willing to be Wu Xun, and we hope that everyone is willing to be Wu Xun. Will these more than 8,000 impoverished students be able to attend school with peace of mind and await enrollment? Their parents are even more wholeheartedly hoping that their children's results in the scholarship identification test will provide a positive answer. Now, excellent academic achievements have been demonstrated through the exams, and we should quickly donate more to enable them to continue their education and achieve higher levels of accomplishment. Good seeds of flowers, if not moistened by rain and dew and irrigated by human effort, cannot grow on their own. If we want to blossom good flowers and bear excellent fruit, we must first strive to irrigate them.</p>
<p>In this great era, everyone is suffering, but everyone holds a bright future in their hearts. At least a large part of this future must be entrusted to the next generation of compatriots, because our collective efforts must rely on the continued efforts of the next generation. I want to educate my own children so that they can continue my work in the future. I also want to help others educate their children so that they can also continue their work. Society must have mutual assistance in order to have mutual benefit. Esteemed readers! Now is the best time, rise up, rise up, let us join hands to accomplish this great task together.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Ordinances: Re-implementing Separation; The Supreme Command Structure Has Been Completed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The character of the new Koiso cabinet in Japan is that of a cabinet marching the entire nation towards a complete war with close and coordinated attacks by the army and navy. Therefore, even the highly subtle separation of military administration and military command, considering the nature of the Koiso cabinet, is naturally an essential policy. Furthermore, from an objective standpoint, as the war situation deepens, burdening one person with both military administration and military command is obviously not permissible for handling affairs efficiently. The previous Tojo cabinet, recognizing this objective fact, had already, on the late night of July 18th before the total resignation, relinquished the position of Chief of the General Staff to General Yoshijiro Umezu. The new cabinet naturally follows the previous cabinet's policy of separating military administration and military command. The Koiso cabinet, from its inception, specifically appointed Marshal Sugiyama as the Army Minister and reinstated Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai as the Navy Minister. In the army, Marshal Sugiyama and General Umezu are responsible for military administration and military command, respectively. In the navy, Admirals Yonai and Shimada are similarly responsible. Admiral Shimada, since the establishment of the Tojo cabinet two years and nine months ago, has served as the Navy Minister during the Great War, and furthermore, assumed the concurrent position of Chief of the Naval General Staff on March 22nd of this year, with his illustrious achievements being praised by both the government and the public. At this time, with the renewal of the highest leaders of the army and navy, the decision was made to transfer the position of Chief of the Naval General Staff to former Navy Minister Admiral Koshirō Oikawa, while Admiral Shimada will participate in military affairs as a military councilor. With this re-implementation of the separation of the army and navy's political and military commands, the unwavering posture of the Japanese army in dealing with this decisive phase has been established. In the future, the exclusive appointment of these leaders will lead to their active involvement in handling intense and busy military affairs. The new functional structure of the Koiso cabinet and the highest echelons of the army and navy's military administration and military command, as anticipated by the Japanese army, has been properly arranged. The entire nation, united in concentrating war efforts to complete the decisive battle and resolutely shatter the enemy's iron wall posture, has now been completed. The establishment of this iron wall posture almost certainly signifies the unified fighting spirit of the entire nation of Japan.</p>
<h3>Thai New Cabinet List</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The formation of the cabinet by the new Thai Prime Minister, Major Abhaiwongse, has been proceeding with great urgency, with most of it completed in just one day. On the afternoon of the 2nd, the list of the new cabinet was submitted to Regent Phrakiat and officially appointed by royal decree. The Thai Propaganda Bureau announced at 4:00 PM on the 2nd as follows: His Majesty the Regent, acting on behalf of His Majesty the King, hereby appoints the following by royal decree: Appointing Major Abhaiwongse as Prime Minister, concurrently holding the posts of Minister of Transportation and Minister of Finance; Appointing Vice Admiral Kamalanavin, Supreme Commander of the Navy, as Minister of Defense and Minister of Agriculture; Appointing Somhut Chulacharit (former ambassador to Japan) as Minister of Foreign Affairs; Appointing Boon Yakhai (Minister of State) as Minister of Education; Appointing Boonnak (retaining his post) as Deputy Minister of Education; Appointing Yit Thamothitebeti as Minister of Justice and Minister of Social Welfare.</p>
<h3>In Various Regions of New Guinea, Japanese Troops Continue to Fight Vigorously; Japanese Men on Tinian Island Cooperating in Combat</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Japanese troops in New Guinea are currently securing key points west of Hansa Bay, overcoming various difficulties with outnumbered forces, and continuing to fight vigorously. The battle conditions in various regions are described separately as follows: Near Aitape, Japanese troops are cooperating with Japanese units advancing westward from Dutch New Guinea. Since the 13th of last month, they have begun attacking enemy positions on the banks of the Lape River (30 kilometers east of Aitape), counterattacking the enemy division that landed near Aitape, and breaking through the enemy's shallow defenses on the coast, inflicting heavy damage. They are continuing their attacks. Near Sarmi, enemy troops are currently deployed on Wakde Island and near the west of Sarmi on the opposite shore of the island. The enemy's strength, including Wakde Island, is estimated to be about one and a half divisions. In mid-June, Japanese troops in that area launched an offensive against these enemy troops from the left bank of the Brug River, once dividing the enemy forces into eastern and western groups, inflicting heavy damage. Since then, the two sides have been in a state of stalemate and are continuing to engage in combat. Although the airfield east of Sarmi is in enemy hands, the enemy has been unable to use it due to the Japanese army's active destruction efforts. On Biak Island, the enemy's strength is about two divisions, with about 200 aircraft, forming the largest enemy base on the New Guinea front. Under the circumstances of great disparity in numbers, Japanese troops in that area still occupy the vicinity of the eastern cave north of Kongkumer and the northern town area of Zilit, to the area around Walimu Bay in the north of the island. They are using suicide squads to inflict heavy damage on the enemy, causing them to tremble with fear. The enemy who landed on Numfoor Island also has a force of one-half to one-third of a division, with 60 to 70 aircraft. However, the Japanese garrison on the island currently holds key points on the west coast, controlling the enemy's operations. On the night of the 30th, Japanese air units also raided enemy airfields on Biak and Numfoor Islands, inflicting heavy damage. On the same night, about three enemy battalions also landed on Amsterdam and Middleburg Islands, about 40 kilometers east of Soem Island, and the area opposite the islands. The area is a swampy jungle area, with no superior value in terms of combat. The enemy seems to be planning to build a torpedo boat base in that area.</p>
<p>Southern Pacific Base, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Japanese aircraft bombed Sorli Airfield on Biak Island at 8:30 AM on the 30th and bombed Owi Island Airfield across from Biak Island at 8:40 AM. They attacked Owi Island Airfield twice at 9:30 AM, conducting low-altitude strafing amidst heavy enemy fire, inflicting heavy damage. Another team of Japanese aircraft bombed the Karatanli Airfield on Numfoor Island twice at 9:00 PM on the same night, destroying five enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The news of the death of all Japanese soldiers on Saipan Island had just arrived, and now comes news of the struggles of the Japanese people on Tinian Island in the Mariana Islands. It is reported that when the enemy invaded the island, about 3,500 young men aged 16 to 45 formed several volunteer corps and fought alongside the Japanese army. The Japanese government, from mid-December of last year to June of this year, dispatched 37 ships to evacuate Japanese people from various southern regions. However, the local Japanese people regarded defending the Pacific as their responsibility. Only one-tenth of the total number was forcibly repatriated due to special circumstances, while the rest are fighting on various islands of the Mariana Islands.</p>
<h3>Japanese General Headquarters Announces Chongqing-U.S. Aircraft Losses: Recent Count is 113 Aircraft</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced on August 3rd that the army aviation units on the China front repeatedly and heavily bombed Guilin, Liuzhou, and Zhijiang on July 29th, 30th, 31st, and August 1st and 3rd, causing the U.S. Air Force gathered at the airfields to be on the verge of collapse. The combined results of this operation, as of now, are as follows: A total of 38 large aircraft and 74 small aircraft were destroyed or caught fire, and one aircraft was of unknown type, totaling 113 aircraft. More than 16 enemy airfield facilities were destroyed. Our losses were one aircraft that did not return.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Heavily Attacks Various Airfields</h3>
<p>China Mainland Base, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force is launching a vigorous campaign to reduce the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force on the China front. On the late night of August 1st, taking advantage of the moonlight, they launched a major attack on their forward bases at Guilin, Liuzhou Danzhu in Guangxi, and Zhijiang in Hunan. All of these airfields were hit by large bombs. A total of 33 aircraft on the ground were destroyed or set on fire. In addition, six other locations exploded and caught fire. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. The results obtained are as follows: At Guilin, 15 large aircraft and 13 small aircraft, plus one aircraft of unknown type, were set on fire by the bombing. One large aircraft and 20 small aircraft were destroyed by the bombing. In addition, nine small aircraft and four other locations exploded and caught fire. At Liuzhou, four small aircraft were set on fire by the bombing, three small aircraft were destroyed by the bombing, and two other locations were set on fire by the bombing. At Danzhu, the aircraft parking area was completely destroyed by the bombing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Raids on Guilin: Details</h3>
<p>Central China, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The forward bases of the U.S. Air Force are now under constant threat from the Japanese army, as Japanese aircraft have repeatedly bombed Guilin and Liuzhou, their last strongholds for counterattacks in southwestern China, and their mobile bases in Zhijiang, Danzhu, Wuzhou, and other airfields, gradually increasing the results of destroying the U.S. Air Force. They repeatedly bombed Guilin during the day and night, and launched a surprise attack, achieving complete success and a great victory in one fell swoop. At 10:10 PM on the 1st, Japanese bombers bombed the southwest airfield of Guilin. In the confusion, the U.S. Air Force towed out Chongqing aircraft with headlights and wing lights on the runway and taxiways. Upon learning of the approach of the Japanese air raid, two (P40) aircraft took off to intercept. At that time, Japanese aircraft targeted these chaotic and disordered Chongqing aircraft and began bombing. The first batch of Japanese aircraft destroyed three large and four small Chongqing aircraft, setting them on fire. Subsequently, they destroyed one large and five small aircraft. The second and third batches of aircraft then targeted the burning U.S. aircraft, expanding the results of the bombing. At this time, Chongqing's anti-aircraft artillery began firing wildly, but the Japanese aircraft still descended rapidly through the Chongqing army's anti-aircraft barrage, dropping bombs from low altitude, destroying a total of 44 U.S. aircraft and nearly annihilating the U.S. Air Force stationed there. Another team of Japanese aircraft simultaneously raided the southern airfield of Guilin, setting three U.S. aircraft on fire and damaging three. It is estimated that a total of 50 U.S. aircraft were damaged at the two airfields in Guilin. Another team of Japanese aircraft bombed Liuzhou amidst the Chongqing army's intense anti-aircraft fire, destroying seven U.S. aircraft. In addition, another team of Japanese aircraft bombed Danzhu, thoroughly destroying its camouflage area. However, due to the darkness of the weather, the results of the operation could not be confirmed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Night Raids on Liuzhou and Zhijiang</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Base, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese aircraft squadrons attacked the Chongqing-U.S. military bases of Liuzhou and Zhijiang on the night of the 27th of last month, suddenly launching a base annihilation operation. In just a few days, they have established the achievement of destroying over 200 Chongqing aircraft. Each time the Japanese aircraft take off, their goal is to annihilate the enemy, making them chaotic and disorganized before flying back. The Japanese aircraft's night bombing techniques are extremely sophisticated, and night air combat is their specialty. The performance of the aircraft is particularly excellent, and the recent Japanese new aircraft have special devices that cannot be detected by the Chongqing army at night, and their aviation skills are even more exquisite. Once they reach the target airspace, their unique excellence allows them to dive down in an instant and drop bombs from ultra-low altitude, leaving the Chongqing aircraft with no way to respond. The Chongqing-U.S. Air Force can only gradually collapse.</p>
<p>Former Base of Japanese Army Aircraft, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese aircraft bombed the An Kang (southeast Han River basin, Shaanxi Province) Chongqing airfield on the night of the 2nd, taking advantage of the moonlight. They destroyed one large and four small aircraft parked on the ground. The Japanese aircraft also lost one aircraft.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Attaché to Thailand Conferred with Order of the Sacred Treasure, Third Class</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, recognizing the great contributions of Colonel Mori Kaku Shuto, the naval attaché to the Japanese embassy in Thailand, in promoting friendly relations between the Japanese and Thai navies, conferred the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Third Class, on the 3rd.</p>
<h3>German New Weapon: Unmanned Tank—One-Man Torpedo</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters, a Canadian military correspondent reports that the German new revenge weapon Number Four has appeared on the Canadian front in the Normandy region. This Number Four is an unmanned tank, and compared to the "dwarf warfare army" that appeared on the Italian front, its difficulty is incomparable. It differs from the dwarf warfare unit in that it can be operated by a crew within a possible range, or it can be operated by radio. In addition, the unmanned tank can rotate internally, and when it is destroyed, it often has a violent storm.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German authorities announced that in July, the navy sank 22 anti-Axis transport ships, totaling 120,000 tons, and seven were torpedoed. These results were achieved using submarines and the German navy's new weapon, the "one-man torpedo."</p>
<h3>German-Italian Mixed New Army Deployed to the Italian Front for Combat; Marshal Graziani Appointed Commander-in-Chief</h3>
<p>Italian Army Headquarters, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German leader and the Italian Prime Minister have jointly appointed Marshal Graziani, Minister of Defense of the Italian Fascist Republic, as the Commander-in-Chief of the newly formed German-Italian mixed division. This army will soon be deployed to the Italian front for combat. After this new appointment, Graziani issued a proclamation to the soldiers, stating: "German and Italian soldiers, by order of the German leader and the Italian Prime Minister, you have been formed into a new mixed army and will fight the enemy together under the supreme command of Marshal Kesselring and my direct command." Marshal Kesselring also issued a statement to the new army, saying: "Welcome the Italian soldiers to return to the front line and fight alongside the German army to strive for the final victory for Italy, Germany, and Europe."</p>
<p>Venice, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Havas News Agency reports that the headquarters of the Italian Prime Minister issued an order yesterday that the Fascist Party be reorganized into a national defense organization, making the party an auxiliary corps to the active army and the Fascist legions. All party members between the ages of 18 and 60 are members of the party legion, and the term of military service is based on the training period set by the state. Female party members can join the women's auxiliary corps that has already been formed to serve.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German authorities announced that in Italy, the German army repelled the enemy's breakthrough offensive towards Florence on Wednesday, inflicting heavy damage. The German army is currently fighting hard west of the city and several kilometers south of it.</p>
<h3>Burma Alliance: Organizational Outline</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Burmese government announced the formation of the Burma Alliance, whose purpose is to seek the great unity and solidarity of various political parties in Burma, to replace the Ba Maw New Asia Party, to promote the national consciousness after one year of independence, and at the same time, to further unify the various ethnic groups in Burma through the great unity and solidarity of political parties, to create a great Burmese nation, and to establish an integrated relationship with the Burmese government.

<h3>German and Turkish Diplomatic Envoys Have Separately Departed; Japanese Persons Express Views</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Havas News Agency reports: The German Ambassador to Turkey, Ba Mu, flew out of Turkey yesterday afternoon by order of the government. The Turkish Chargé d'Affaires to Germany, at the request of the German Foreign Ministry, will also leave Germany this morning. Other diplomatic personnel from both countries will remain temporarily in Berlin and Ankara, respectively, pending simultaneous exchange with civilians. It is said that there are about 10,000 German civilians residing in Turkey, while the number of Turkish civilians residing in Germany is very small.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Havas News Agency reports that a German official statement last night stated: "The Turkish government today submitted a proposal to the Turkish National Assembly to sever diplomatic and economic relations with Germany. Members of the Turkish People's Party held a closed-door meeting to discuss it in detail. This proposal has been approved by the National Assembly. Thus, Turkey has broken the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty and abandoned its policy of friendship and neutrality with Germany. The Turkish government, under the coercion of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, ignoring the warnings of the German government, has abandoned its freedom and independence and entered a wrong path. The Director of the Department of Intercourse of the German Foreign Ministry told the Turkish Chargé d'Affaires in Germany this afternoon that his mission in Germany has now ended and asked him to leave Germany immediately."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Well-informed sources recently expressed their views on the German-Turkish severance of relations as follows: Germany and Turkey are economically friendly countries with mutually complementary needs, and there are no political conflicts. Therefore, the severance of relations has no reasonable cause. In a word, Turkey's move was forced by Britain and the United States. As for the impact on the war against Germany, because the embargo on war materials to Germany has already been implemented in the past, there is no substantive change. There is also little impact on the Balkans, as Germany's military preparations for the Balkans have been successful. Even if Turkey provides its territory for use by Britain and the United States in the future, it will not immediately affect the Balkan war situation. As for Turkey's future movements, it depends on the attitude of the Soviet Union. Turkey is caught between the competition of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and its difficulties can be imagined. Also, this German-Turkish severance of relations has no element in the legal sense that would cause changes in Japan's relationship with Turkey. Turkey is also an Asian nation and has been friendly with Japan for many years. Now it has succumbed to the oppression of Britain and the United States, and Japan has great sympathy for it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Fiercely Attack Chongqing Forces in South China</h3>
<p>A Japanese Army Base on the South China Front, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Since July, various units of the Japanese South China Army have launched an offensive to annihilate the enemy in the northeast and west of Guangzhou. At the same time, the Chongqing forces are actively defending Shaoguan and are successively dispatching the 16th Division to the southwest of the West River. The Chongqing forces now have a force of more than eight divisions deployed on the front line. If this is the case, Yu Hanmou will definitely defend the Seventh War Area to the death. The Japanese army is currently launching a fierce attack to annihilate them in one fell swoop.</p>
<h3>Rommel Injured in Car During Air Raid</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - A German military person said that Marshal Rommel was injured in a car during an air raid on July 17th and suffered a concussion. It is said that his condition is quite satisfactory, and his life is not in danger.</p>
<h3>Minister Chen Orders the Rectification of Discipline</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Minister of Judicial Administration, Chen Enpu, arrived at the ministry at 8:00 AM on August 1st to assume office. It is learned that Minister Chen, at the beginning of his tenure, specifically issued orders to his subordinates on the points of rectifying discipline, preventing abuse of power, rigorously implementing simplified procedures, and paying attention to prison security, for them to follow.</p>
<h3>Flour, Wheat and the Sino-Japanese Bank: Establishment of Wheat Loans Totalling 60 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Control Committee of the Commerce and Trade Commission, considering that wheat from various districts has already been purchased by designated buyers, and that the price of wheat has more than doubled this year, requiring significant funds, specially negotiated with the Sino-Japanese Bank for a wheat loan of 60 million yuan to meet the purchasing fund needs. After several consultations, an agreement was formally signed a few days ago. The loan amount will be equally shared by the Chinese and Japanese banks. The Japanese banks participating in the loan are Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Chosen, Bank of Taiwan, Mitsubishi Bank, Imperial Bank, and Sumitomo Bank, committing 30 million yuan. The Chinese banks participating in the loan are Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China-Hsing Bank, China Industrial Bank, Kuo Hua Commercial Bank, Sze Ming Bank, The National Commercial Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Kincheng Banking Corporation, The Continental Bank, Chekiang Industrial Bank, Chekiang Real Estate Bank, The Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, and The Development Bank of China, committing 30 million yuan. The Bank of China serves as the representative of the wheat loan syndicate. The loan will be implemented through acceptance drafts, with rediscounting handled by the Central Reserve Bank. The loan interest rate will remain the same as last year, at 8% per annum. Because this wheat loan concerns the people's livelihood, the banks will not increase the interest rate to ease the burden on the people. It is reported that the loan has been approved with a guarantee from the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Rice for Shanghai Residents: Resumption of Rationing Decided; Increased Ration Amount to be Implemented Early This Month</h3>
<p>Since the suspension of rice rationing for Shanghai residents two months ago, the Municipal Government has been actively consulting with various parties, striving to restore rationing to maintain the people's livelihood. It is learned that after several consultations, the Allied military authorities have agreed to transport large quantities of rice from rice-producing areas such as Hunan Province to Shanghai for use in the resident rice rationing program. Therefore, rice rationing in Shanghai is expected to return to normal around the beginning of this month. Detailed measures will be determined by the Goods Allocation Office within days, and rice prices in Shanghai are expected to decline further. Mayor Chen issued a statement yesterday (the 3rd) as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor Chen Issues Statement</p>
<p>It has been two months since the suspension of rice rationing in Shanghai. The Executive Yuan, in order to regulate the food supply for the residents of Nanjing and Shanghai, promulgated the "Outline for Measures on Rice for Residents of Nanjing and Shanghai" on June 1st of this year. However, rice prices not only failed to be suppressed, but also increased excessively, contrary to the government's original intention of suppressing rice prices. Fortunately, the Municipal Government quickly implemented various emergency measures, and rice prices began to decline, but the increase was still more than double that before June 1st. The seriousness of the food problem for Shanghai residents has not been alleviated. Rice prices are the basic factor for all commodity prices. If the food problem is not resolved reasonably, the price problem will be difficult to resolve. The Allied authorities also pay close attention to this and have repeatedly expressed their willingness to assist our country in solving the food problem. After repeated consultations with the Municipal Government, the Allied military authorities have agreed to transport large quantities of rice from rice-producing areas such as Hunan Province to Shanghai to supply food for the residents. The rice rationing for Shanghai residents, which was suspended for two months, can be restored to normal from the beginning of this month. As in the past, each citizen will be rationed two pints of rice every ten days. Hereafter rice rationing can also be handled accordingly. Detailed measures will be determined by the Municipal Goods Allocation Office in the coming days. At a time when the war is becoming increasingly urgent and there is a shortage of rice, the Allied authorities have taken this wise measure, which is deeply appreciated. It is hoped that all sectors of Shanghai can understand the Municipal Government's painstaking efforts in planning food rationing, and rise up together to practice thrift and increase production to assist the government in seeking victory in the Greater East Asia. There are high hopes."</p>
<p>Statement from the Japanese Embassy Authorities</p>
<p>The Allied Embassy's Shanghai Office authorities issued the following statement regarding the increase in rice rations: Since June of this year, rice prices in Shanghai have soared, and all commodity prices have risen sharply, severely impacting the lives of the people. This year's wheat harvest is the most abundant in recent years, and rice is also expected to be abundant due to favorable weather. At this time, the Japanese army has recently achieved great victories in Hunan, and other abundant rice-producing areas have joined the peace zone. As a result, rice prices in Shanghai and other places are gradually declining, which is highly commendable. Regarding the purchase of rice in newly operated areas, we are already working closely with the Japanese army to provide a continuous supply of large quantities of rice. Therefore, the temporary suspension of rice rationing in the Shanghai area is now not only about to be restored, but also the increased rationing of wheat flour and miscellaneous grains can also be implemented. It is hoped that the lives of the people, who have long suffered from high rice prices, can be turned around. Regarding the Rice Control Committee's purchase of rice this year, the Japanese side will fully cooperate and provide all assistance. We are now preparing military equipment to successfully purchase new rice and achieve full results. In addition, the recent surge in rice prices and all commodities is due to large-scale hoarding. Now, the rationing system will be restored and a comprehensive purchase strategy will be established for new rice. Therefore, it is essential to suppress high prices. The authorities have decided to strengthen the crackdown and hope that all parties will actively cooperate to eliminate this unstable situation and stabilize the lives of the people.</p>
<p>Organizing Rice Stock Registration</p>
<p>After the former Food Bureau was ordered to be abolished, Director Feng You was appointed by the Municipal Government as Director of the Municipal Goods Allocation Office, and took office on August 1st, with public announcement. In order to understand the actual amount of rice in Shanghai, the Office has launched a citywide rice stock registration. Regardless of japonica rice, indica rice, brown rice, white rice, or glutinous rice, registration should be applied for at Section 1 of the Office, Room 701, Shanghai Special Municipal Government, No. 201 Jiangxi Road, before noon on the 10th of this month. The authorities have absolutely no intention of purchasing or confiscating rice. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention and report truthfully, and assist the government in its original intention of suppressing rice prices. The Office's announcement is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Announcement: All rice stored within the city limits of this city up to August 5th, regardless of japonica rice, indica rice, brown rice, white rice, or glutinous rice, shall be registered with Section 1 of the Office, Room 701, Shanghai Special Municipal Government, No. 201 Jiangxi Road, before noon on August 10th.</p>
<p>Rice shops, businesses, factories, entertainment venues, and other organizations storing more than 12.5 piculs (1 ton) of rice; the limited amount of rice stored by citizens is calculated at 2 pints per person per month. Those exceeding the limit of 6 pints for three months.</p>
<p>Applicants for registration must sign and seal the application form and indicate the following:</p>
<p>Name of the business or individual name and address and occupation of the rice owner; type and quantity of rice; storage address of rice (if stored in a warehouse, the warehouse receipt number should be indicated); use of rice (but if the rice is intended for personal consumption, the number of consumers and their monthly consumption should be indicated); average purchase price per picul and purchase location.</p>
<p>Warehouse operators within this city must also register the amount of rice in their custody (excluding military use), regardless of the quantity, with the Office before the end of business on August 5th.</p>
<p>Name, address, telephone number, and name of the person in charge of the applicant's business; name and location of the warehouse; name of the business or individual entrusting the custody of rice; warehouse receipt number, type, quantity, and date of storage of the rice. If the registered rice is moved, the purchaser shall report it in writing to the Economic Security Office at No. 279 Datong Road within three days. This rice registration is aimed at clarifying the amount of rice in the city and there is absolutely no intention of confiscating or forcibly purchasing it. However, those who refuse to apply for registration or make false registrations within the specified period will be confiscated upon discovery without leniency. Please comply accordingly. This is a special announcement."</p>
<h3>Unifying Baojia Administration: Symposium Held; Director Chen Convenes to Give Instructions</h3>
<p>The Baojia system in the first district of Shanghai has been completely unified since the administrative and police changes. The unified area includes the former first district, the former eighth district, and the former southwest Shanghai area. Thus, the Baojia area under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Police Bureau's Baojia Office has significantly expanded. In order to promote future Baojia self-governance work, the Office specially convened a symposium at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 3rd) on the eighth floor of the Municipal Police Bureau, gathering branch bureau chiefs, chief Lianbao chiefs, and Baojia committee members to pool ideas and achieve police-Baojia cooperation to conform to the unification of Baojia. Director Chen personally attended the meeting to give instructions.</p>
<p>Director's Instructions: Director Chen gave instructions at the reception for the chief Lianbao chiefs and branch bureau chiefs, saying: "Our country created the Baojia system thousands of years ago, based on the 'mutual assistance and mutual support in times of illness' principle of mutual Baojia regulations. However, some have abandoned the fundamentals and pursued the trivial, or forgotten the source after achieving the goal, heading north when intending to go south, resulting in limited effectiveness. Since Shanghai actively promoted the Baojia system, all crimes and violence have almost disappeared. After the recovery of the concessions, we have further strengthened the Baojia, adopting the advantages of China's inherent political system, referring to the characteristics of the times, adapting to circumstances, neither adhering to preconceived ideas nor following the prevailing customs. Since its implementation, it has strengthened the people's self-defense forces and has indeed made significant achievements in assisting in maintaining local security. Its characteristic lies in the implementation of police-Baojia cooperation. In the concession area, which was previously dominated by British and American forces, the people and the police were alienated, making cooperation impossible. Last August, in order to strengthen the police-Baojia connection, a Baojia Office was specially established within the Bureau to take charge, formulate regulations, handle self-governance, investigate households, eliminate undesirable elements, and assist the government in promoting government orders without sparing any effort. Recently, the compilation method has been revised. In the near future, a headquarters will be established, with important personnel from the Police Bureau serving as the head of the corps and commanding and supervising at all levels. In this way, the agencies at all levels of the police corps headquarters will be coordinated with the agencies at all levels of the Police Bureau. In other words, the police corps will cooperate with the General Bureau as one.</p>
<p>Official and civil cooperation: The official police force and the civil self-defense forces are integrated into one, thus eliminating the past alienation between officials and civilians. The Baojia Guidance Committee of the former Public Works Department and the Baojia Committee of the former French Concession Public Board no longer exist according to law. The Baojia Guidance Committee of the former Public Works Department Police Station has also ceased its activities. Now, in order to communicate voices at all levels, a Baojia Committee is established in the Bureau as a consultative body for Baojia addresses at all levels. The voices of the people are communicated to the officials, using the Baojia Committee as a bridge to achieve a harmonious exchange of official intentions and popular opinions. A solid Baojia foundation is the precursor to improving the political system. Today, Shanghai is implementing a self-governance system under the principle of police-Baojia cooperation, which is an excellent opportunity for citizens to achieve self-governance, self-defense, self-reliance, and self-education. We must not procrastinate and miss it. At this extraordinary time, everything depends on the</p>
<p>Public consensus: With the spirit of sacrificing the individual for the benefit of the masses, the country's future may not be bleak. As for the collection of Baojia expenses, there has been no clear regulation, with each region acting on its own. Some responsible personnel in various districts have suffered losses due to advances, while others have arbitrarily collected expenses, causing suspicion among the people. Therefore, it is urgent to formulate a unified collection method. Hereafter, 80% of the collected expenses will be used for various expenses in each district, and 20% will be used for overall facilities. With the unified collection method, the malpractices of excessive collection and compensation will be eliminated, and the funds will be taken from the people and used for the people, with complete transparency, so that the people will no longer have any doubts. In this era of great change, officials and civilians should have a sense of unity in times of adversity and cooperate to overcome difficulties, so that Greater East Asia will be secure. Recently,</p>
<p>Recovering scrap metal: Regarding the movement to recover scrap metal, the Baojia at all levels is particularly relied upon to promote it, so as to fulfill the responsibility of contributing to the rear of the Greater East Asia War and to achieve the goal of strengthening the nation and achieving national independence. In the future, all large-scale public movements will use Baojia as the operating model. The important role of Baojia lies in being able to promote all government orders, supervise layer by layer, command layer by layer, work quickly and effectively, and make the orders of the central, provincial, and county governments penetrate deeply into the people. Gathering strength is easy, and unity of purpose achieves success. On the one hand, obstacles can be eliminated, and on the other hand, self-defense, self-governance, self-sufficiency, and self-education can be achieved. Moreover, it is necessary to</p>
<p>Promote smoothly: Therefore, the application of Baojia must be self-reliant and adapt to the needs of the times. Such as the allocation of materials, the encouragement of increased production, and restrictions on blockade, etc., all must be united in their efforts and mobilized to make the aging Baojia system rejuvenated and take on a completely new look. Furthermore, we will adopt the strengths of the municipal administration of countries in the East and West, and combine them into one. Day by day, a good system can be built for all countries in the world to learn from. From then on, Baojia will no longer be a mere term in the system, but a new political system. From then on, Baojia will not only have the simple function of combating corruption and banditry and ensuring security, but will also be a new type of agency for promoting government orders, organizing the people, and training the masses, so that the upper and lower levels will follow suit and respond to every call, enabling the Chinese people to gradually have unity and discipline, and expanding the concepts of loving the individual, loving the hometown, and loving the local area into loving the country and loving East Asia. This new type of political agency is the political system we idealize. We hope that you will work together to promote and realize this idealized political system." Subsequently, Director Gu of the Baojia Office and Director Hiraoka of the Police Defense Office successively reported, pledging to cooperate in promoting the instructions of the authorities in order to achieve the goal.</p>
<h3>Police Headquarters: Strengthening Supervision; Zonal Supervision System to be Implemented</h3>
<p>After the official establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Headquarters, the police administration in Shanghai has been unified. In order to establish strong security in Shanghai, in addition to adjusting the county police stations in detail, all police sub-bureaus in the urban area are now working with the Supervision Office of the Bureau to strengthen supervision and will implement a zonal supervision system in order to perfect the police administration of Greater Shanghai.</p>
<p>Announcement of Candidates for Five Sub-Bureau Chiefs: The Shanghai Police Bureau has made adjustments to the candidates for deputy and branch chiefs of each sub-bureau. Deputy Chief of Zhabei Sub-Bureau Kawate Yagoro, Deputy Chief of Yixian Sub-Bureau Nishimura Kiyotsugu, Deputy Chief of Xiejiao Sub-Bureau Ohashi Takeichi, Deputy Chief of Zhonghua Road Sub-Bureau Sato Takashi, and Deputy Chief of Dongchang Road Sub-Bureau Kato Seizo all reported to the Bureau yesterday for duty.</p>
<p>Regular Inspection of Vehicle Equipment: According to the person in charge of the Administrative Office of the Police Bureau, in order to adapt to the city's air defense lighting control and sound control, it has now been announced that from the 7th to the 18th of this month, vehicle lighting shielding equipment and alarm whistle sound control of vehicles such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles will be inspected at the Racecourse. Vehicles that pass the inspection in accordance with the specified date will be issued a special "Lighting Inspection and Sound Inspection Certificate of Qualification" by the Traffic Section of the Bureau on the spot. Those who fail to undergo inspection after the deadline will be fined and their driver's license will be revoked.</p>
<h3>Minister Lin of Propaganda: Broadcast Last Night</h3>
<p>Minister of Propaganda Lin Baisheng came to Shanghai on official business a few days ago. Yesterday (the 3rd) at 9:00 a.m., he inspected the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency, New China Daily, Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Ping Bao, and Min Shi News, and visited Allied News Agency and Continental Daily, New Shen Bao, etc. It is learned that Lin also broadcast to the youth of the country on Shanghai Radio last night (the 3rd) at 9:00 p.m., entitled "The Understanding that Youth Should Have of the Restoration Festival," and gave a very detailed account of the historical basis and significance of the Restoration Festival.</p>
<h3>Jiang Zhaohe's Painting Exhibition: Opens Today</h3>
<p>The charity exhibition of famous painter Jiang Zhaohe held a preview at the China Painting Academy on Jing'an Temple Road, Chengdu Road yesterday (the 3rd) and invited the city's news media to visit. In addition to Jiang's painstaking work "Refugee Map," there are other fine works on display, and the official exhibition will open today.</p>
<p>Short Comment</p>
<h3>Resuming Resident Rice Rationing</h3>
<p>Resident rice rationing in this city has been suspended for two months. Now the authorities have officially stated that rationing will be resumed in the coming days, with each person receiving two pints every ten days. For the citizens, this news is like waiting for clouds during a severe drought. Now that the sweet rain has fallen, it is naturally something to be gratified about.</p>
<p>However, the entire solution to the rice problem requires both fundamental and symptomatic treatment. How to treat both the symptoms and the root cause? We have already expressed our views to the fullest extent in the past. In Mayor Chen's statement during the Restoration Festival, he said: "Nanjing and Shanghai are both metropolises, only six hours apart by train. I really don't understand why the price of rice in Nanjing is around 3,000 yuan today, while the price in Shanghai has reached 10,000 yuan. I think it's not just a failure of human planning, but a deliberate attempt to make it bad." This can be said to have keenly pointed out the crux of why the rice problem in Shanghai has become a mess.</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope that after the resumption of resident rice rationing, it must be on time and, further, the rationing period must be shortened and the rationing amount increased. At the same time, special attention must be paid to the lessons of past failures so as not to repeat the mistakes. The uninterrupted flow of rice absolutely depends on the continuous supply of rice. Therefore, how will new rice be purchased? How will prices be set? These are extremely important issues. Although the authorities have stated that they are paying attention, there has been no active discussion of this issue. In short, those who bear the major responsibility for rice control must be reformed and strengthened, and a permanent and stable result cannot be achieved without it. This is the feeling that arises first when we hear that resident rice rationing will be restored.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Limits Brokers: Advance Payment of Reserve Funds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, in order to prevent malpractices by brokers due to the recent sharp fluctuations in the stock market, has stipulated that brokers shall pay settlement reserve funds in accordance with the regulations. Now, it has been found that some brokers have not fully paid the settlement reserve funds that they should have paid, which is really inappropriate. Now, according to the request of broker representative Kang Xueyuan, etc., because this procedure is being handled for the first time, some brokers may not be familiar with it. Please allow them to start doing business. Therefore, it is specially notified that if another stop-loss occurs today, all evidence that should be paid or advance payment must be paid in full before 5:00 p.m., otherwise no more compensation will be provided.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit Cafes, etc.: Operating Overtime</h3>
<p>The Administrative Office of the Police Bureau of this city recently discovered that the Queen's Cafe on Xizang Road was operating overtime and imposed penalties. It is learned that among the cafes investigated by the Office, there are also several, including the Xizang Road Shi Li Hotel, Jin Gu Cafe, Ye Hua Yuan, and the Qichongtian Cafe on Nanjing Road, which are all operating overtime and have been given written warnings. Furthermore, the Xin Xianlin Garden Restaurant on Jiangning Road was found to be selling wine and dishes exceeding the savings limit price and was reported by the Jing'an Temple Sub-Bureau and given a written warning. It is heard that the Office, in order to thoroughly promote energy conservation, will have stricter regulations on the time limits for entertainment venues such as dance halls, taverns, and cafes. It is currently being drafted and will be implemented as soon as it is decided.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Orders Energy Conservation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau strictly ordered the Zengye Trade Association to order all members to strictly abide by the regulations of the Municipal Government and absolutely stop using electricity, and even the necessary and proper use of electricity should be conserved as much as possible without any waste, in order to achieve the goal of energy conservation and increased production.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Press Release Time: 6:20 p.m.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Special Municipal Government Proclamation: Hu Shi Er Zi No. 7907</h3>
<p>This city has recently experienced transportation difficulties and various forms of transportation have been obstructed, especially the source of coal is not easy, and the consumption of electricity has to be restricted as much as possible. It is now stipulated that from August 5th of this year, the following uses are strictly prohibited (except for those deemed necessary). Violators will have their electricity supply cut off. This proclamation is hereby issued to all users in this city for compliance. Failure to comply will be punished. Details are as follows: Electric fans, elevators (except for those above the fourth floor), air-conditioning equipment, machinery and equipment used for entertainment and games, non-public private swimming pools (including tap water), display window and advertising lights, electric heating appliances used in barber shops, light bulbs with more than 100 candle power (except for promotional movies, dramas, and other special relations), and electricity selling lights connected from inside the house.</p>
