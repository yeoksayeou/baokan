<p>社評</p>
<h3>戰時必須增產</h3>
<p>日本飛機生產，自側重於超重點生產以來，業經年餘，成績卓著，飛機工業已由幼年期一躍而至壯年期，其進步和發展之速，殊足欽佩（見十八日本報）。綜其原因，約有兩點：一爲工作人員的效率增高，一爲工作人員的數量增多。這是增產運動中的唯一法門，要想增產的國家必須效法。</p>
<p>中國是參戰國家的一份子，可是對於武器的製造，中國在重工業方面的基本鋼鐵事業根本沒有發達，因此對於這一方面的工作，也就無從幫助。中國在現環境中所能做的，只有農業和輕工業，而農業和輕工業在戰爭時期就可以幫助國家解決食和衣的問題，我們要使每畝田的米，麥和棉花的產量增加，我們要使從事農業的人數增加，我們要使每個紗廠裏的紗的產量增加，我們更要使從事紗廠的人數增加。這些都是我們中國唯一所能努力的，努力的結果，可以安定民生，可以增加戰力。</p>
<p>中國在這一方面增產的需要，十分殷切，但是觀察目前的生產情況，不能不使我們自覺慚愧。就把農業來說，種田的人數不但不能够維持原狀，反而有逐漸減少的趨勢。至於紗廠有的是已經停頓了，有的是一天一天地減工。我們的目的在增產，可是我們天天往減產的路上走。這些都是事實，我們無容諱言，我們也不能否認。這個情勢，假如任他延長下去，且不談能否協力戰爭，中國人民的衣食就立刻要發生問題。怎樣打破難關？這是政府和全國有心人士目前所最應注重的課題，更希望盟邦上下竭力的協助。</p>
<p>第一，統制方法必須改良，統制的目的在乎獎勵生產，便利分配，而現在統制的結果有時可使生產者消極，因此可使生產者不願生產，生產量旣然減少，分配問題當然更不容易解決，米糧統制是一個最好的實例。經過一番失敗，我們就得想法改良。戰時國家實施統制政策是無可疑問的，所以問題並不在於制度本身，而在於統制方法及人事問題。我們對於米糧統制已經說了許多的話，這些話不僅是對於米糧統制的希望，其他的統制事業鑒於米糧統制的失敗，當然亦須改進。</p>
<p>第二，扶植農工業的整個計劃，必須決定。就以紗廠而言，假如要繼續大量生產，必得定整個計劃，合乎開工條件的要使他開工，要供給原料，要供給電力。不合乎開工條件的就該明明白白地囑其停工。政府要取主動地位，要扶助並獎勵能够增加生產的人員，自然就可取得生產物的支配權。從農業上原料的生產，到工業上成品的製造，再到製成品的分配，這三步是聯結的，是整個的，需要全部的計劃，枝節的應付是不能解決的。目前雖不能做到全部農工業的扶植，至少先要樹立幾個模範，以便逐漸推進。</p>
<p>戰時增產固然是件困難的事，但是戰時而不生產或減產，則有促成整個不利的危險，所以在任何艱苦的環境中，我們必得想法促成增產的實現。</p>
<h3>日軍進擊巴列爾　奪獲敵堡壘七處　哥希馬周圍戰況日趨激烈</h3>
<p>仰光二十五日中央社電　緬甸戰綫日軍精銳，十七日再度進擊死守巴拉爾之敵軍，步工砲各隊，於緊密協力下，漸次推進攻擊據點。十八日下午十一時，日步兵敢死隊携地雷，於黑夜中接近敵陣，實施爆炸破壞工作，並以新銳兵器射擊敵軍，迄天明止，共奪獲敵軍堡壘七處，完成進攻路綫。</p>
<p>仰光二十五日中央社電　敵軍對哥希馬周圍日軍陣地之反攻已日益激烈，並自北方增强大批兵力，以期打通哥希馬至伊姆法爾之公路。爲進攻哥希馬東北五一二〇高地之敵軍，自十九日之攻擊失敗後，二十一日下午五時四十分，敵軍二百名又以坦克車，大砲進擊該高地最高地點，然經激戰後，卒被日軍擊退。此歷時二日之激戰，敵軍棄屍一百十五具，日軍並擊毀其迫擊砲四門。此外，敵軍又向哥希馬南方阿拉茲方面增加兵力，向一四〇〇高地附近前進，同時，並將携有迫擊砲之精銳部隊，調遺至哥希馬東方三十公里之龍盤茲密附近。</p>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　據康台來電，東南亞洲反軸心軍司令部發表稱：伊姆法爾戰綫，比先波爾地區之日軍，最近增强實力，十二日於砲火之掩護下，實行進攻。</p>
<h3>完成包圍三面總攻　日軍昨晨佔領洛陽　正繼續追擊殘敵擴大戰果中</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日大本營發表（五月二十五日下午六時三十分）：　被包圍監視中之渝第一戰區軍之根據地洛陽，日軍部隊，於五月二十四日午後，開始對之攻擊，今（二十五日）最完全佔領該地。　是役日軍所獲戰果，迄今判明主要者如下：日方收容渝軍屍體二千具以上，俘虜四千名以上，（鹵獲品）大砲十五門，槍械八百挺。</p>
<p>新鄭二十五日中央社電　於河南日軍以一部兵力，包圍渝軍第一戰區根據地洛陽，同時以主力追擊湯恩伯·蔣鼎文·胡宗南·等渝野戰軍主力，二十四日對洛陽開始總攻，二十五日上午八時三十分將之全部佔領。日軍以洛陽係文化地區，多名勝史蹟，故不忍加以破壞。且此次作戰之主旨，係爲擊滅渝野戰軍，故對洛陽之攻擊，破壞極微。爰日軍有力部隊，於五月十日起，即相繼到達洛陽近郊，完成包圍形勢，然並未急於進攻。是時即以一部兵力包圍洛陽，以主力從事掃蕩渝野戰軍，斯時渝軍因如喪失洛陽，則於政治及軍事上均有重大影響，遂對洛陽城內約三師之渝軍，嚴命死守。當時日軍以城內守軍不接受日軍勸吿，遂不得已，即於廿四日下午三時，開始總攻，自東北西三方面，向城內迫進。結果卒於廿五日八時三十分悉予佔領。是役渝軍棄屍二千具以上，被俘四千餘，日軍並鹵獲大砲十五門，槍械約八百挺，獲得偉大之戰果。</p>
<p>澈底擊滅一八區軍</p>
<p>新鄭廿五日中央社電　日軍於今次河南作戰，曾澈底擊滅敵第一戰區軍，及第八戰區軍，共計七軍廿八師，於全作戰期間中，日軍曾以迅雷不及掩耳之神速戰勢，獲此偉大戰果。此固爲日軍作戰之指導有方，亦全體將士勇敢奮鬥所致。即湯恩伯自大東亞戰爭發動以來，極力避免與日軍衝突，而一面積養兵力，最近麾下軍隊之抗戰力量，已見充實，預測已足可應付日軍之進攻。且在本年二月前後以來，推測日軍必將發動進攻作戰，故極力進行抗戰準備，因此日軍今次作戰開始，渝軍即取積極戰法，反成爲日軍之好餌。彼於第一期殲滅作戰時，雖於京漢沿綫及伏牛山脈喪失其麾軍之大半，然仍以其敗殘軍，及蔣鼎文指揮之殘軍，第一戰區軍，及第八戰區軍胡宗南軍等，集結於洛陽西方之新安。迨第十期殲滅戰後，日軍當即向洛陽直進，並判知彼等於該地實行攻略作戰，於日軍背後方開始大反攻。然日軍引至此等敵軍北後，自山西省垣曲附近，以新銳部隊突行渡過黃河，遮斷隴海綫，遮斷其與第八戰區間之連絡。日軍主力迫至洛陽後，更引反轉接近集結於宜陽濟寗附近之敵軍主力，將其追至洛河及伊河河谷地帶，以戰車部隊及騎兵部隊之大集團，長驅殺至盧氏，封鎖敵軍退路，由三方突進河谷地帶之敵陣，而獲一舉殲滅之戰略。日軍刻正繼續搖蕩敵軍敗殘部隊，擴大戰果中。於河南省一帶自中日事變以來，於日軍進攻作戰上，此次實爲一罕見之現象。即於今次日軍開始進攻以前，河南住民均協力日軍，陸續奮起，實行解除敵軍敗殘軍之武裝等工作。素稱中國中原沃部之河南，亦因多年抵戰，人民負閑不堪，同時一般民衆反抗湯恩伯苛征暴歛，乃聞日軍進攻之良機而奮起。現今日軍新佔領地區居民之面上，皆呈快樂之色，物價已見減低一成矣。又據渝美空軍，當今次作戰初時取傍觀態度，並無積極之戰意。然至作戰後期，由於蔣介石之泣訴，乃以成都·梁山·漢中·興安·等作爲基地，以戰鬥轟炸聯合編隊約二百架，自西南地區飛來。十二日因日軍機隊急襲遂川機塲，一舉炸毀其四十五架，于狼狽之餘，其協力渝軍之態度，實極冷淡云。</p>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　據重慶來電稱，渝軍司令部發表，二十二日日軍已佔領盧氏。</p>
<p>新鄭二十五日中央社電　進攻嵩縣之日軍挺進隊，對洛陽平原向西南方潰走中之蔣　文所部，隨處加以襲擊。並一路向嵩縣盧氏之山道前進，茲已進抵美軍在渝前進基地之盧氏地區，十九日至廿日晨，業將該城附近之渝軍約千人擊退，將之佔領。</p>
<p>日擊落敵機十一架</p>

<h3>海軍紀念節特輯之六</h3>
<p>日俄之役的特別攻擊隊</p>
<p>…珍珠港之役，及一九四二年五月的息尼，南非的第埃哥，沙勒士之役，日本特別攻擊隊立下了不朽的傳勳，使我們不禁想起三十九年前日俄戰爭時抱着魚雷的五勇士奇襲旅順港之壯舉。惜當時此舉終歸失敗。五勇士之一的退役海軍特務大尉井上未吉氏（六〇歲），今尙健在，茲據該氏所談當時情形如下：</p>
<p>…日俄開戰時，余爲三等兵會，服務於戰艦富士號。從明治三十七年二月到八月，封鎖並攻擊旅順港，全艦隊將士辛勞非常，且亦有不少犧牲。敵人怕我從海上攻擊，在港口佈下了堅固的防禦設備。而我們則計劃突破這防綫而奇襲港內。</p>
<p>…於是服務戰艦富士號之余，及錨屋凡平，蘆內槌松五人，商量抱着魚雷泳入港內炸壞敵艦，向長官申請，獲得許可，開始訓練。這是用二根杆子，上面載了魚雷，四人各支杆子的一端，一人爲魚雷的射手，接近敵艦時放射。當時的魚雷，重量大約齊巧浮在海上。</p>
<p>…準備完畢了，訓練也純熟了，乃於明治三十七年七月三十日夜，從乘艦富士換乘水雷艇進向旅順港附近，我們五人更換乘舢板帶着魚雷划向港口。回顧黯淡，風狂浪高，舢板幾遭顚覆。到了港口，五人赤裸着全身，僅穿一條褲，載着消防夫般的頭巾帽了，跳入海中。</p>
<p>…但風浪愈加洶湧，敵砲台的探照燈，照耀如同白晝，防得水洩不通。固然，我們誰也不想生還，但可惜終於無術可以突入，祗能絕念退回。可是亦竟獲得了感狀。（翔：譯自每日新聞）</p>
<h3>東鄉元帥  金言集</h3>
<p>最良之補短術即勇氣也</p>
<p>敵之砲力强而我之砲之力弱，未必可畏。我刀雖短，突進則可斬。因敵彈及我，我彈不達彼而避敵，是爲無勇，是爲無智。以此而期制勝，難矣哉，我彈若不及敵，進至能及處猛射可也。</p>
<p>戰士之精神更甚於兵器之精銳</p>
<p>觀明治三十七，八年戰役中之俄國軍人外表，與其謂之爲弱，毋寗稱之爲强兵。然與日軍接仗後，連戰連北，此何故歟？蓋彼等多數相信交戰之事爲軍隊或軍艦之任務也。從而勝負之決定亦以軍隊或軍艦之存在爲限，茍破之，則彼等即思自身爲軍人之任務業已吿終，頗少更繼續作個人之奮鬥者。余意此爲不敵日軍之大原因。至於日本軍人，非僅一艦一隊，縱戰至一兵一卒，亦必盡忠殉職，以成本分。此種覺悟，堅勝鐵石。唯此始爲護國之寶。今後隨兵器等進步，非更涵養此種精神不可。</p>
<p>名譽與降服決不兩立</p>
<p>彼等固有名譽之降服一詞，然在日本軍人，無論何時，名譽與降服絕對不得兩立。</p>
<p>不勝則死，此爲我軍人應守之第一義，戰時而另有穿　，皆屬辭費。</p>
<p>武士道之覺悟</p>
<p>我國中古水軍之意外進步，非僅在於戰術技術，尤在武士道之覺悟，其精神若應用於今日之海戰，則歐美戰術家將見其意想不到之事。例如丁字戰法乙字戰法，無非是由此而暗示之創見。</p>
<p>本武士道之見解而惋惜敵將</p>
<p>羅塞斯托文斯基提督洵爲非常人物。　若是之大艦隊而航行一萬五千浬之長途，其拔倆苦心，不難省察。惟彼未嘗勇往邁進以圖早日抵達目的地海參　，而於途中狐疑逡巡，此點難表同意。然彼我之道德根本相異，以我之是而一概望之於彼，或爲無理亦不可知，惟若率直陳述對彼之希望，則望其於日本海海戰之際依然繼續奮鬥，以身殉國是也。茍活貪生，甘爲俘虜，在彼實爲不堪惋惜之事也。</p>

<h3>戰局之推移與我等之覺悟　大陸新報理事長對日僑廣播</h3>
<p>大陸新　社尾坂理事長，於前天（二十四日）下午七時二十分起，約達二十分鍾以「戰局之推移與我等之覺悟』為題，假大亞放送局，向華中播　要旨如下之演購，解釋現階段決戰日迫之大東亞戰爭，同時並述處於現時局下對於六十萬日僑的希望，給與多大的銘感。</p>
<p>昭和十六年十二月八日這一天，不但對於日本民族，即對大東亞十億民族，是永久不能忘却的光榮的大柬亞戰爭開始的一天。自這値得紀念之日以來，迄今已達二年五月餘，以日數計，　續作戰已達八百七十四天。關於其間的戰局，一如衆所周知，或謂為　壯，或謂為激烈，敵我兩方均傾竭全國之力，展開在世界戰史上得未曾覩的殊死戰。就全般地，或就全局觀之，眞是日日連續着決戰，便說是雙方未有一天鬆弛作戰精神，也非過甚其辭。</p>
<p>在這壯烈的彼我決戰中，眞是決戰中的決戰，互以白刃擬向心臟，所謂互相制以死命，為民族興廢命還之所繫，而決戰之決戰階段，已迫在目前，此亦諸君所詳者。茲値戰局處於這樣重大時期，看看明天已屆海軍紀念日，比殊饒有意味。我等處於斯際，對於大東亞戰爭局面將怎樣其體地向那一方向推移，與當前之敵英美，抱着怎樣的心思等等應明晰地深印腦中。無論怎樣，對於此關係祖國與亡之戰爭，應冷靜地，對於戰勝的覺悟，應益鞏固如磐石。</p>
<p>原來此次大東亞戰爭，在緒戰之初時，因我方的猛烈攻勢，而極遽烈展開。適如兵法所謂：「先發制人」。我方海陸軍，巧妙而且機警地運用這「先制」的好機。即就事實　之，在自十二月八日開戰以還不足一年問，我方海陸軍所收獲的大戰果，在東方由於猛襲夏威夷珍珠灣，美國太平洋艦隊全淢，在西方繼香港新加坡之陷落，遂至如疾風捲殘葉長驅直搗馬來與緬甸。更於南方攻略菲島，將廣大的荷領東印度　島收入掌握中。益進而活躍於所羅門羣島方而，一時聲勢大發，甚至完全制住澳洲的死命。當時英美之失望與狼狽情形，幾乎慘不忍覩。</p>
<p>因緒戰挫敗而蹶起</p>
<p>然而敵方到底斷不從此掩泣而終，正如諸君所熟悉，美國自建國以來，尚未有過與外國交戰敗　之事，是以大總統羅斯福為中心的一班戰爭指導者。在「莫忘珍珠港之恥」的心契言辭底下，他們為思他日復仇，而着手猛烈擴充軍備。</p>
<p>美國人的擴充軍備，到底是怎麼樣的？第一是擴充航空兵力，第二是增强强軍艦與船舶，於是在作戰已屬可能，而打算就緒時，始出動所謂對日反攻。美國的反攻，是開始於去年十一月十九日之吉爾貝特島作戰。至今日回顧敵人前進的足跡，首自去年十一月十九日登陸吉爾貝特島，至今年一月，登陸馬紹爾　島，二月登陸亞達美拉爾特，四月登陸荷朗迪亞，一步步就近，於此　得鞏固對日決戰的足塲。</p>
<p>增强隱然戰力</p>
<p>試一觀察敵今後在怎樣情勢下推動戰爭，第一成為問題的，是菲律賓。敵方的作戰步驟，是利用向來循序漸進的足塲，一方面出動機動部隊，向非島集中猛烈攻擊，至如其豫想佔領菲島之際，便在中國廣東省周圍，施行大規模的登陸作戰，而以此為最大的反攻基地，完全把日本擊潰。</p>
<p>至於說到日本現在所為何事，這當然的，日軍必不拱手眺望敵軍之反攻姿勢，在吉爾貝特島作戰之際的塔洛亞血戰起始，日軍將兵隨處對於敵軍之反攻，予以猛烈邀擊。實給予敵方損害極大。而於此應明白分別者，具作戰方法不同，現在是立於防禦攻勢的立塲上，就大局觀之，我方正在從事豫料孫子也曉得說：「作戰是以攻取勝，」不消說，戰略的第一義是攻。然則我方為什麼現在不出以進攻呢？其實，現在我方之防禦，決非單是為防禦而防禦，那是欲以在諸戰時所獲得的大戰果為基礎，現在趁這時機，傾竭一億國民之力，孜孜不息，建築起嶄新的而且堅韌資朴的戰門力，為的是獲取最後的勝利。</p>
<p>就日本國的塲合而言，最初是用强力把敵方壓抑，而敵方雖無能而被壓抑，但至最近也就漸漸恢復起來了。此際我方對於一度整軍經武，改善戰況之敵，亦準備佔計適當的機會，一氣擊伏之。</p>
<p>决戰生活的勝利關鍵</p>
<p>在這樣重大的時局下，我們現地居留民必須牢紀者，有兩個事情，第一，須更頃主努力於增强日本戰力，航空機的增產，軍艦，船舶的增强，自不下去，必須由我門約手運到前綫的日本將士，因此我們必須厲行儲蓄减低生活費更是必要。</p>
<p>第二，我們現地居留民，必須與中國人更緊密地携手，來戰勝那左右大東亞民族命運的火戰爭，如今已經不是說『要理解中國人』的時候了。甲國人與日本是同住在一個村的，並且是隣居的。兩國的來往，已開始於一千年前或二千年前了。其間兩國雖也有過發生不和睦的事情，但也有互相帮助的事情。所以如果以誠心誠意來交際，則理解自可以產生出來。尤其我們來到現地，打攪中國，所以我們必須率先以誠意對待中國人。如此，則中國人也必信賴我們，我們現在這樣地深信着。</p>
<p>我們的遠大前途</p>
<p>總而言之，在現今重大時局下，深信我們現地居留民最重要的任務，第一為挺身於增强戰力，第二為誠意封待中國人。我們充分瞭解這個決心時，深信日本才有遠大的前途，並日本東亞共榮圈各國也可以一同　開我們前途</p>

<h3>日本海軍發展史</h3>
<p>天保山閱艦式</p>
<p>明治元年三月二十六日，大阪天保山海面舉行閱艦式，這是眞正的日本海軍歷史的開始。明治天皇踐祚後不久，即巡幸京都市外，自安治川刀船入海遊覽。</p>
<p>「海實是偉大的東西啊！」這是當時從左右傳聞的話。海愈廣大，日本海軍活躍的舞台也愈廣大。天昆的驚嘆，就是對日軍海軍所寄的無限希望。</p>
<p>參加這天閲艦式的全部艦船共計汽船十艘：電流丸（肥前），萬里丸（肥後），千歲丸（久留米），三邦丸（薩州），華陽丸（長州）　萬年丸（勢州）。道裹面有正式的軍艦構造者祗電流丸一艘，是砲艦，僅八百噸，這算是旗艦，其他也就可想而知了。誰會想到在七十五年之後，這會成爲世界第一的大海軍呢？</p>
<p>艦內膳食</p>
<p>且明冶初期的海軍，軍艦都屬於各藩所有，尙不是國家的海軍，所以是極雜亂無章的。從熊本戲納的能驪艦的甲板上，數設着靑疊。而士官·水兵都在舷門的欄杆處向海中小便。雖是極端的歐化，但艦內的膳食，也有豆豉醬，也有鹹離蔔。</p>
<p>有一次，檢視艦內時，看見了鹹蘿　桶。</p>
<p>「這是什麼？」</p>
<p>「是用鹽渍的籮　。」</p>
<p>「真的嗎？那很好。」</p>
<p>爲了强化日木精神，也必須有日本獨有的膳食。於是軍艦上都備着　蘿　，豆豉醬等東西，沿襲至今。</p>
<p>中國事樊初期，筆者會從軍於最初在吳淞敵前登陸的旗艦。翌最，承長谷川淸司令官招待用膳，艦內豆腐，豆豉汁的津津有味，迄今猶未忘却。</p>
<p>初乘軍艦</p>
<p>明治五年五月二十三日，明治天皇初次乘龍　艦從品川出發，從伊勢，大阪，神戶橫斷瀨戶內海，從長崎巡幸至薩摩而返。德川幕府曾堅請天皇勿出外巡幸，以歷代天皇從未出京都市外一步。但時代已大不相同了。這時候，明治天皇並且初次着軍服出巡。這是也值得大　特書的。這成為先例，明治天皇後來在閲艦式中，每次均着陸軍服。日俄戰爭後，由於山本海軍大臣的請求，自此以後，開了一個行例，在閱艦式中着海軍服。</p>
<p>國產軍艦</p>
<p>從明治建軍之初起，一武器即以本國自製爲根本信條，日軍的强處，就在這一點。</p>
<p>橫須賀造船所在明治入年就已造了最初的軍艦。那就是淸地艦。明治天　最組臨主持進水式。淸運是木造艦，速力九節半，船員一百七十一人。現在想來，真像玩具般可愛的軍艦。井上良聲元帥曾爲此艦艦長。在西南戰爭告終的翌年，明治十一年，從事最初的遠洋航行，麼經法國，西班牙等歐洲諸國。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭時，在旅　海面喪失了八島與初　二巨艦，舉行御前會議，決計無諭如何須在日木補充，於是日本開始建造像今日這樣的鍋鐵艦。</p>
<p>造船家們反對說；因爲不能造成能耐高熱的鋼板與鋼管。可是：「一旦經御前會議決定，就不能不斷然實行。」</p>
<p>於是漸漸的建造起來，造成了戰艦。美國驚成道：「看日木的住宅，比遊牧民的天幕並沒有進步多少。然而却建遺了世界羅優秀的軍艦，實是不可思議的。」</p>
<p>故平賀博士等，實是建艦之神。</p>
<p>黃海海戰</p>
<p>沒有烟，也沒有雲。不括風，也不起浪。……</p>
<p>這是誰都知道的日淸戰役中黃海海戰的軍歌。中國有東方最大的軍艦定遠，鎭遠，當他合併北洋，南洋，福建，廣東四艦隊來與我决戰時，實爲我聯合艦隊的三倍。</p>
<p>日本很明瞭我海軍處於非當的劣勢朝野都非常憂慮。先在　烏海面使中國海軍爲之喪膽，繼在黃海擊況軍艦四艘。那定遠艦也受了很大的損傷。管是納爾遜的特拉佛爾伽爾以來的大海戰。</p>
<p>以前，里蘇戰略相信鐵甲艦必勝的鐵則，丁汝昌爲其研究家，當然也援用道戰術，但日本用獨得的新戰術擊破之，全世界爲之驚訝。而此後的海戰術爲之一變。</p>
<p>這黃海海戰中，離都知道有一件祥兆，有一只鷹停在高千穗的帆柱上。這鷹後來送到廣島大本營飼養，明治天皇愛慰備至</p>
<p>繼起的威海衛海戰中，了汝昌投降，全部軍艦交付日本，自己服寗自決，虎死留皮，人死留名。名將的末路，傳誦千戰。</p>
<p>水兵之母</p>
<p>甲板上有一個水兵在哭泣。兵官見了，叱責道：「卑佉的東西！恐懼戰爭嗎？懷　故鄉嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，斷不是爲了那些事。請看造。」拿出了一封女人筆跡的信。</p>
<p>「聽說你在　島海海戰中，威海衛的攻擊中，都沒有參加。母無顏見村人。每日向神佛祈禱速參加決戰。」</p>
<p>長官也爲了留守後方的母心而泣下了。那時候，對於未參加海戰者，都互以沒有武運，且戰爭方才開始的話，自慰自勵。日本海軍的强處，也有着道種女性的祈求。</p>
<p>初乘潛水艦</p>
<p>明治三十二年，美國電蘭博士建造了潛水艦。「募集實騐潛海的希望者。」公吿天下。大家都感危險，沒有人申請。那時候，突然有一個日本人出來：「那麼，我願一試。」這位就是海軍少尉佐佐木高志。</p>
<p>他恰巧在遠洋航海途中，寄航美國，就利用這個機會。這時同乘潛水艦的經騐，曾向當局提出，並向海軍省請求：「希望日本速即從一建造潛水艦。」</p>
<p>時機太早了，這時候還不能提出這建議。幾千幾萬個白人中，沒有一應募者，正表示我們鉻來獨往的氣概。這就是珍珠灣和息尼的持殊潛航艇魂之萌芽。</p>
<p>日本海海戰</p>
<p>像日本海海戰那樣壮烈的海戰，堪稱空前絕後。敵八是波羅的海艦隊。那是歐洲有數的精說艦隊，加案爾曾讚歡之爲「彷彿是浮在海上的俄帝的大本營。」</p>
<p>從利　滿出發，進行對罵水道。—縣程萬里。歷時八月。道種大遠征，歴文上未之前見。在飛機，潛水艦出現後的今日，是絕對不可能的。在對方　來，實是毫無缺點的敵人。</p>
<p>對此，我方的作戰如何？</p>
<p>在旅順海戰，黃海海戰中，儘量减少我方的損失，而與敵以大打擊，那是因爲還剩有波羅的海　隊，爲準備對付起見，必須作孤注一擲決勝負的大決戰。此次殲滅之後，就不再有其他的艦隊了。祗有一艘逃到浦鹽。不管受了多少損害，祇要統統幹了，此方面就勝了。</p>
<p>東鄕司金長官採了絕望的戰術。「敵前回轉」，自古以來是必輸的戰術，而絕對忌避的，但東鄉大將部毅然實行了。</p>
<p>敵人看見東鄉之艦動，大喜道：「啊！得勝了；得勝了—東鄉是不懂戰術的。」</p>
<p>敵巨彈策中三笠。</p>
<p>但正在那千鈞一髮的時候，我艦隊橫過來，彼我恰成「丁」字形，敵人不能通過，三十餘艘敵艦隊，全軍覆沒了。實是暢怏的勝利。</p>
<p>在日淸之役的黃海海戰中，打破了里隡戰術而創造新戰術的日本海軍天才，在日本海海戰中又創造另一新戰術。歐洲稱之爲「東鄉圓轉」，旭特蘭海戰中，　國希倍爾提督　做此術，繫沈英主力艦二艘。日本所創造的海戰之光榮的新紀錄。</p>
<p>於是五月二十七日不以是日木的海軍紀念日，也是戰史上永垂不朽的全世界的海軍紀念日。</p>
<p>可恨的華府會議</p>
<p>但日本海革並沒有一帆風順，順利的完成了今日世界第一的强國。從另一方面看來，那是滿佈荊棘的道路。</p>
<p>明治十九年，軍艦敵傍在合灣洋面行踪不明。那是日本向法國定造的優秀艦，繫着最大的希望，所以日木朝野的驚愕，恰如喪失了威爾斯親王號時候的英國一樣。建設大海軍的萌芽在道囊折斷了，但不屈不攪是日本海舉的信條。愈經艱難，愈有勇氣。日俄戰爭時。僅有的八艘戰艦中，八烏，初瀨一時都沈沒了。明治末期，有佐久問艇長的悲劇，這是尊貴的犧牧。</p>
<p>但最　恨的，是大正十年的華盛頓會議。英美共同策謀强制五五三的比率。這是從三國干涉交憑遠東半島以來最大的痛恨。英美藉口减輕人民因增加海軍經費的負擔，消減戰爭的不安因素，而用此得意的外交手段，而加重日木的重壓。</p>
<p>加藤實治大將報告東鄉元帥說：「誠爲不合理壓迫。」元帥慰喻說：「但英美無論加何是不能在訓練上加以限制的。」</p>
<p>自此以後，發現了新的光明。前所米有的猛訓綶，開殆實施了。日月火水木金土七曜日戀成了月月火水木金金。刮目以待，其後果如何？</p>
<p>大東亞戰</p>
<p>江戶時代，西部有一　　藹</p>
<p>烨子讓蛇　住他的身子，奮力一迸，劍亦無其銳利。</p>
<p>象　大東亞戰相貌的文句，無更切於此者。</p>
<p>英美渝荷四國聯合結成ABCD綫,聖經上說：『鳩的愛與蛇的智　。」但他們是沒有鳩之愛的黃頷蛇。</p>
<p>日本是除了在春郊歌頌王者之盛與文明之德以外沒有他念的雉子。蛇想吃這雉子，用毀棄通商條約，削減比額制，資產凍結等種種陰險手段，一圈圈團　來。雉子領翼屏息，一任所爲，毫無反抗。</p>
<p>但必物有其限度。蛇如其沒有反省，終須取最後全手段。</p>
<p>奮　而起，蛇作寸寸斷。</p>
<p>珍珠灣，罵來海面，一馬尼刺　，阿留申羣鳥，以至於所羅門。</p>
<p>怎樣處理道飛散的蛇的肉段，是今後日本的問題，但烨子須下戒心，切不可飽食自足。（　　自週刋每日）</p>
<h3>敵美組織的　四方面軍</h3>
<p>羅斯福所蓄意組織的四方面軍。其內容如下：　中國大陸方面，爲渝方重隊。總司令官為蔣介石，副總司令官兼駐中印　美軍總司令官爲史帶威爾，中美混合空軍司令官為辛諾特。　東南亞洲方面，爲蒙特巴頓軍。總司令官爲蒙特巴頓，印度洋英艦隊司令長官爲桑瑪維爾，駐印英美空軍最高司令官爲庇亞斯。　西南太平洋方面爲麥克沃塞軍。總司令官爲麥克沃塞，副司令官兼地上軍司令官為勃萊米，空軍司令官為凱尼，美第七艦隊司令長官兼海軍司令官爲金凱特。　太平洋方面爲尼米資軍。總司令官爲美國太平洋船隊司令尼米資，副司令爲道斯。</p>
<p>該四方面軍的增援量，麥克沃塞軍佔美國全部戰綫，補給置的十分之一至十三分之一，蒙特巴頓軍與麥軍相彷彿，渝軍在第一級補給之列。至於尼米資軍，去年末，尼米資誇構：「美國現擁有戰門艦艇八百八十隻，主力艦隊大部分集中於太平洋。艦隊的編制，改爲以航空母艦爲中心的輸型陣。」故尼米資軍等於全部海軍，其實力遠較其他三軍爲强。（譯自同盟世界週報一二四七號）</p>

<h3>田園景色</h3>
<p>— 石羽</p>
<p>粉紅色的桃花，被溫暖的春風一吃，便輕輕地從枝頭上溜了下來，落在汚泥的池上，他們互相怨恨自已的愚苯，不該離開了母親，在這裹彼人蹂躪；當人們的苯重的脚步，踏着牠們嬌弱的體驅時，牠們曾發出求援的呼聲，絕望的呻吟，但是人們沒有聽見，依然殘酷地在牠身上踐踏着走過去；有時他們飄落下來，落在溪面上，溪面上起了漣漪，把牠們疾捲着，不管牠們是怎樣的悲傷鳴咽！絲絲的柳絲，似少婦的繼腰在微風中輕邊；一簇簇白的柳絮，隨着含笑的春風各處飛揚，空溫漾着麥子的甜杳，倒垂的麥穗在陽光的照躍下，發出耀眼的黃色。活潑的魚兒時常躍出水面，水面上驚起了「　喇」「嘩喇」的聲音，水沫四處飛濺；過後，水面又恢復了牠的平靜，原來春已殘了。這時一個五六，背上背着一個竹　；手囊拿道鐮刀，渾圓的臉一龐，黑而有神的眼珠，高一　的鼻子，櫻桃似的血紅的嘴唇微微地撅着，眼睛襄有着一層薄薄的淚水在浪動。她的小乎揉着眼睛，一雙污　的小脚，戰着遺個細小的身體在泥地上彳亍着『泥地發出細微的歡息聲。忽然「小凌」一聲呌喚，從樹林喪發出來，接着一個面目生得很澝秀的女孩子，穿着翔翔的綢製的衣服，一而嚷一而，以為和她開元笑，便帶跳地奔過來，用手搖她的肩膀，一而氣喘喘地說：「你為什麼不理踩我？」但她看到小凌的臉上有淚痕時，便又驚呼起來了：「啊！你什麼又哭啦？」小凌只含糊地應了一聲「想」！她用了許多話頭逗她同伴說話，但是小凌總不貫開口，只是傷心地哭；後來她也被小凌引得要哭出來了，小凌才嗚咽地說：「都是你害我的，呌我到你家裏去玩，媽媽說我草割得這樣少，把我　了一頓，說我貧賴，罵我賤丫頭，一天到晚不肯做事，只是和有錢的小姐鬼混，你看，媽把我的臉都打　了……「哇」！她摸摸她的傷痕，又傷心地哭起來了。「你媽爲什麼總是不歡喜你？」她仰着臉，天偵地問小凌。小凌哭着迫：「因爲我不是她親生的女兒，所以她不喜歡我，我的親生媽已死了，她是我爸後來娶來的，她愛弟弟，因爲第弟是她親生的………」小凌一面不斷地揉着眼睛，斷績的嗚咽聲過漾在空氣裹！</p>
<p>這時宇宙間的一切似都沒有了，只有兩顆小心的跳動聲，人類最偉大的友愛已把她們的心緊緊地聚繫在一起了。</p>
<h3>新生</h3>
<p>— 戎戈</p>
<p>今天，淸算過去的舊賬，過去的一切都得拋棄，別再幻想着美麗的夢，別再讓悲哀佔據了心，別再流弱者的淚，揮一揮手，挺一挺胸，就從今天起，走出灰　的池沼，把握着一個健全的心，展開一頁熱望的新生！</p>
<h3>悼亡友</h3>
<p>— 唐敏</p>
<p>僅僅在二個年頭之間，我如指算算有不少的親友成爲古人了。頂可痛心的，大多數還是很年靑，他們都是倔强地想在道世界上抒扎下去的，可是一種不可抗拒的力量壓到他們的身上，他們不得不拋開了他們苦難中的伙伴。想想看：當他們暨下最後一口氣，眼看着道樣破碎的世界，能够安心地放下眼皮來麼？</p>
<p>除了很少幾個是病故的，其餘都死得很奇奇怪怪。我每次按到海樣噩耗總禁不住驚惕地想着：我該怎樣結東我的生命呢？按着，我抱住頭哭了。</p>
<p>在去年，從一到遼遠寄來的信中，知道有一個歡同學死了。同樣，這是一件不能够使人相信的事，他是這樣年淸而且强健，但是信中明明寫着他的兇訊，他是沉在水涇裹死了！</p>
<p>寫這　信的友人有着一枝細膩的華，他用陰　的字句詳細地叙述他死亡的情形，這使我想起我和他半年來共同的生活，從回憶裹激起感情，使我不</p>
<p>我曾經和他在同一個宿舍囊住過，當時，我是第一次雖開家，起初以爲不成問　的事情偏偏成爲問題，他總是帮着我解除道些困難。有一次，我爲洗衣服的事情煩惱着：自己洗，在廚房裏倒着一盆一盆的水實在累不過一氣來一：呌別人洗，常常在洗乾凈的衣服裏發現　子，這呌我怎麼辦呢。不知怎的，我把面盆摔在地上，生起氣來了。他笑着說：</p>
<p>「到　裏去洗好啦，好裏水多大多淸凈！」</p>
<p>從此，我聽從他的話，把一條腿跪在潭邊的岩石上，俯下身子去洗衣。一有時，我和他做着同樣的工作，他在衣服上塗上了肥皂，用石子敵搗着，過了一會，在水裹漂淸，撩起來一件衣服便洗好了。我稱議他手法的熟練，他並不劉我客氣：</p>
<p>「道有什麼可以稱讚的呢？……我在外面己經流浪了好幾個年頭，這種事情當然能够應付了。誰知他的話還在我心頭嚮着，他却在一個城　，為了應付這件事情，在　邊的岩石上一沒，跌在水裏淹死了！</p>
<p>我記得，在二年前，我們分手的時候是多麼依着呵！我的　夫已經好幾次催促我上道，可是我們想起半年來共同所受到生活上的辛酸，堅握着手不能分開。</p>
<p>祝你旅途平安！……回到府上，多親親令堂！」</p>
<p>他是對我說着這種話，我除了祝福他身體健康之外，跟他有什聽話可說呢？是把人家的安慰當作　慘的人、我只能够把許多活故在心底裏，用眼睛表達着我的感情。</p>
<p>輛夫們抬着我已越過了一條田　，他還在後面追着這句話：</p>
<p>「不要忘記我，記着不要忘記我！」</p>
<p>我知道這句話所包含着的　辛，他是一個孤獨者，他希望朋友們在精神上能和他發生述　。真的，我沒有忘記過他，尤其是他　　身子洗衣的一幀圖畫，常常在我的腦膜裏明晰地出現！</p>
<p>但是他死了，他不死在木位上，而死在一件洗衣服的事上！……他死得太偶然了，容許有一個「如果」的話，他在現在還活着，倔强地活着！</p>
<p>在信中還說明他死後遭到剝屍。雖然這位友人不忍描寫他棺木被敲碎的慘狀，但是我閉起眼來，那情形似乎很淸楚的。我見到破碎的給木片散在地上，在他赤精的屍身上有幾條狗在哨着他的肉，咀　着他的骨頭，在林莽巾得意地長　着還有幾條狗氣咻咻地趕來，舔着留在地上的血跡，紅着眼爭奪着……（忘憂草之三）</p>
<h3>燕來了</h3>
<p>— 程會燦</p>
<p>燕來了！</p>
<p>又是處處聞啼鳥的春天，蘭藍無垠的天際裹，有幾粒黑點在飄動。和暖的煦負，掀起了一陣飛舞的揚鷹，輕輕地酒在人們底身上，有時播進他們底眼　，於是人們自然地揉一揉眼皮，再睜大了眸子，向四週探望着什麼。</p>
<p>燕來了！</p>
<p>細長的翅膀，帶着輕飄的身驅，在空中來去地飛着，飛着。剪刀似的長尾，留着些南國底塵土氣味，黝黑的眼球裹，更顯露着跋涉的辛勞，但它「吱吱」的悠鸣，却　然表現出自由的愉快和優游的生活！</p>
<p>燕來了！</p>
<p>一隻，二隻，三隻，……，每個尖嘴裹，都含着一根細枝，它們正在努力建築着它們底行營，同心協力地積極合作，不怕風來吹，不怕雨來打，在這樣一個自建的巢穴裹，它們自食地養活着。等到丹桂飄香的時節，它們又會亳無留念地離去，轉向那朝氣蓬勃的地方追求，永這舍日由地追求！</p>
<p>燕兒呵燕兒！我欽慕你自由的愉快，更妒嫉你優游的生活，我雖然强能自食其力，但我却不能隨時任意離開我不願意留下去的地方。蓬勃的朝氣，對我祗是片刻的安慰，却不能永遠自由地追求。燕兒呵！我願意向你學習，隧你飄蕩。你願否帶我到天崖海角去尋求自由的生活呢？</p>
<p>燕來了！它給我帶來些鼓舞的力量，聊解我久渴的期望！</p>
<h3>綠色的離情</h3>
<p>— 顧依卿</p>
<p>飄忽得像流星底閃痕，</p>
<p>飄忽得像夏日底黃昏，</p>
<p>飄忽得像美麗的靑春，</p>
<p>朋友！我們這片刻短暫的相聚；</p>
<p>是飛燕底希求暖晴，</p>
<p>是燈蛾底期冀光明，</p>
<p>是雲雀底渴望凌雲，</p>
<p>明天，你將堅决離我而遠去！</p>
<p>我們原是人間底漂萍——</p>
<p>微風使我們相依相親，</p>
<p>柔波使我們吐訴衷情，</p>
<p>可是，現綺夢裏的美景終將幻滅；</p>
<p>在這　昏燈影，</p>
<p>在這辛酸的錢行，——</p>
<p>聽哪！峭寒的春風在頻促我們離別！</p>
<p>這裏我驚起綠色的芳醇一　，</p>
<p>默祝我契已的心友：「再見，珍重！」</p>
<h3>「十三妹」與「燕靑與李師師」</h3>
<p>— 古辛</p>
<p>「十三妹」是「華北」出品，「燕胃與李師師」是「滿映」出品。兩片都取材於通俗小說，但成績都不怎樣滿意。</p>
<p>用這種故事拍攝電影，意識是根本不能談的，英雄，美人，英雄才子，製片商　然也不過想藉這些歷來「家傳戶誦」的東西來吸引一般知識比較低產的「大衆」。「十三妹」更用「舞台紅伶初上銀幕」的吳素秋做號召，全片也都集在她一人身上做文章，門武啊，唱歌啊，而戰劇閒展前她底一個時裝鏡頭，完全　角作片。雖然到自里很加了些「前進」的語詞，那是毫不相干的</p>
<p>至於「燕靑與李師師」，則連主題都沒有把握定，編劇者一邊想迎合觀衆，多叙此燕靑與李師師底　漫斯，一遷又想把重心移到宋江底「投　」上——富劇本已放到道演手裹，他們（想是合漸的）還在矛盾的心境中舉足未定。</p>
<p>「燕靑與李師師」放映在我們眼而的，只是一圑紊亂，導演似乎也給這一白零八條好　累得手慌脚亂，不知如何應付了。開打，胡胡　　地來一陣，抒情，只不過多來幾個李師師底「含情脈脈」的特寫一段落間（瞥如宋江從東京返梁山泊，泊到燕靑二度入東京之問）缺乏聯　性。觀眾底情緒一點也抓不住。</p>
<p>還是「十三妹」底導演在技巧上倒有點小總明。從現實化到夢幻，象徵歲月消近等手法都不錯，雖然並不特出。幾個幽靜的畫面也很美。但他底成就，也僅止於此而已。此外對於人物底表現，意榮崁配合，簡直是京戲和無　電影底戰　兒，腐氣十足。二</p>
<p>演技方面，兩片是同樣地糟。甚至主角底性格都只模糊地一個輪廓。表情不是呆板，便是膚淺：皮動肉不動。「十三妹」底對白和剪接更多了一層膩，依然不脫盡蝶派木色。「燕靑與李師師」里有些演員似乎在模仿上海底明皇模仿優點，當然好，假若只模仿一個形式，那就更糟。</p>

<h3>東華聯誼合作成功榮獲國際足球錦標</h3>
<p>本星期一，中華隊與意大利隊會師於跑馬總理塲，次奪國際否，事前雙方厲兵枺馬，均具奪標雄心。我中華隊　集東華聯　兩强之精鋭，組成一支鐵軍，同心協力，沉舟破釜，志在必得。該日謠傳東聯二隊，因人題問題，意見未趨一致云云。球迷聞訊，無不杞憂，結果兩隊健兒均精神抖擻，我裝臨陳，事實勝於雄辯，謠言不攻自破。數萬觀衆，歡聲曾動，手之蹈之，足之舞之，情况之熱烈，應戴之殷切，費非筆蟲所能形容。鏖戰之下，我隊賴三軍用命，所向無前，卒以三對一力挫意軍，高奏凱歌，輝煌燦爛之國際足球盃，重入我人懷抱。我上海體育史上，留下光榮之一頁，誠快事也。</p>
<p>進攻退守前後聯絡</p>
<p>是役我華隊諸將，個個奮勇，表演奇佳，進攻退守，頭頭是道。前後聯絡，呵成一氣，尤其中衛線堅强無匹，有如鐵城金湯，敵騎難越雷池一步。譚福楨輕裘緩帶，八面玲瓏，饒有儒將風度，較其北來時確已進步不少，的是可兒。（福禎球路純然，遠在意將奧托里尼之上，謂爲全滬第一中堅，當非過譽。）兩後衛亦智勇兼備，穩健有加，比賽開始後約十分鐘時，敵鋒帶球深入，距門僅隔數碼，形勢危殆，羣以爲必進無疑。幸張林根從旁趕到，有如飛將軍從天而降，拚命臥地一鏟，得以化險爲夷，姿勢美妙，嘆爲觀止。此球若被射中，則墓隊先失一城，局勢大變，眞不知鹿死誰手也。</p>
<p>前鋒短傳細膩剔透</p>
<p>至於前鋒綫之短傳，細膩剔透，妙不可言。意軍素以中衛綫强硬著稱，對此竟亦束手無策。全賽過程中，球之控制，三分之二操在我手。敵雖頑强，安得不敗。國牛李義臣此次一改故態，賣力異常，憑其天賦之雄偉體格，東衝西突，在困難之地位中，竟能兩破敵門，建下不朽偉績。其第二球之進，峻急無此，重逾干鈞，恰切橫木於中。麥尼蒂瞠目而視，罔知所措，允稱養臣生平傑作。（謔者謂義臣此球，以門票價格比喻，可値二十五元，佔其一半云。）鐵腿孫歸順，穿針引綫，功不可沒，前鋒錢之能水到渠成，攻勢旺盛，端賴此君從中接濟。在時間將告終時，右翼貿幼良得左邊傳球，閃過敵衛，舊身躍起，迅速一頂，球出如矢，雖爲麥尼蒂接住，但巳使其駭出一身冷汗，而此美妙之　頭，大可擊節嘆賞，令人縈迴腦海，永不能忘</p>
<p>總之，此賽爲本季最精彩之一戰，情况熱烈，亦屬空前。而我中華隊榮獲冠軍，克償所願，尤令吾人萬分快慰者，於此謹向中華睹健兒祝福，並望在與津聯隊角逐時，更有佳妙之演出。據記者晤聯隊大同小異。其守門之功攻方策，能小傳遞，利用兩冀之表演極少。唯中衛綫極有力，甚望滬上足聯容，所以克敵也，則幸矣甚矣！（梅潔）</p>
<h3>國强小學體育表演——節目富有敎育意義——</h3>
<p>兒童是國家的基磯，兒童教育，便是鞏固國家基礎的工作。兒童天性是好動的，在正當遊戲中，給予其正確敎育，功效就更安大。</p>
<p>都市兒童缺少自然的環境，整天在死讀書中，麼滅其天賦的活動力。上海，除了一二公園可供兒童遊息外，其他遊樂的地方，簡直很少，就連可供消遺的戲院，最近也不能涉足。大同路國强小學爲了提倡兒重遊戲，解决兒童苦悶。於前日（二十一日）舉行體育表演，招待家長及全市小學生，憑校徽入場。記者得訊之餘，特往參觀。</p>
<p>到該校在小學生彬彬有禮的招待下，走進了人頭擠擠的命塲，佈置得蘭單隆重。當擴大機的報告中，傳來了一聲聲淸脆的國語，節目是開始了。</p>
<p>該會節目，共有「相依爲命」「手語」「救護練習」等四十九種之多，都含有敎育意義，現簡單的略爲記數則如下。</p>
<p>相依爲命助人助己</p>
<p>是一個盲者（用布蒙目）扶着一個跛子，在共同的目標下，肓者聽了跛子的指導，達到他們共同需要的目的地，一路上互助着還抬起一件一件的阻礙物件。這就是告訴我們，互助是人類的天職，殘廢者在互助合作下，也能得到成功。不過，在成功的道上，還得隨時小心去解除一件一件阻磯物。</p>
<p>救護練習敏捷非凡</p>
<p>是任何人都該知道的常識遊戲分四人爲一組，其中一人假設爲受傷者。待動員令一下，只見六條眼像前輸般飛過去。一會兒負着傷者，包紥得完完整整，安抵目的地。其動作之敏捷，就是護士們也會驚奇的。</p>
<p>堅强鐵鏈大家努力</p>
<p>這節目就是拔河比賽，是充份表演出集體力量，大家團結一致。全部力量合作放在一根繩子上，在塲翻衆的心情，也隨了繩子的移動而收縮着。</p>
<p>馬球賽中戀戀而返</p>
<p>馬球賽是一項富有興趣新頴的遊戲。每隊四組，每組四人，其中一人為騎師，三人做馬。其規則塲地略如鹽球。二組為衛，二組爲鋒，相應傅遞，爭奪投擲。演來攻守有方進退有序。其精彩與藍球相同，而特別有嘘頭。記者因時已晚，在馬球賽表演緊張中，戀戀而返。</p>
<p>綜上所述，是表演中的片段，特地介紹。還望於熱心兒童敎育的敎師們和愛護子女的家長們，多多的提倡。（瘦記者）</p>

<h3>Wartime Production Increase Is Essential</h3>
<p>Japan's aircraft production, since focusing on ultra-priority production, has been more than a year, and the results have been remarkable. The aircraft industry has leaped from infancy to adulthood, and the speed of its progress and development is admirable (see the 18th issue of this newspaper). In summary, there are two main reasons: one is the increased efficiency of the workforce, and the other is the increased number of workers. This is the only way to increase production. Countries that want to increase production must follow suit.</p>
<p>China is a member of the Allied nations, but in terms of weapon manufacturing, China's basic steel industry in heavy industry has not developed at all, so there is no way to help in this area. What China can do in the current environment is only agriculture and light industry. During wartime, agriculture and light industry can help the country solve the problems of food and clothing. We must increase the yield of rice, wheat, and cotton per acre. We must increase the number of people engaged in agriculture. We must increase the yarn production in each yarn factory. We must also increase the number of people working in yarn factories. These are the only things we in China can strive for. The result of our efforts can stabilize people's livelihoods and increase combat power.</p>
<p>China's need to increase production in this area is very urgent, but observing the current production situation cannot but make us feel ashamed. Taking agriculture as an example, the number of people farming is not only unable to maintain the status quo, but is gradually decreasing. As for the yarn factories, some have already shut down, and some are reducing work day by day. Our goal is to increase production, but we are heading down the road of decreasing production every day. These are all facts, and we cannot hide them, nor can we deny them. If this situation is allowed to continue, not to mention whether we can cooperate in the war, the food and clothing of the Chinese people will immediately become a problem. How to overcome the difficulties? This is the most important issue that the government and all concerned people in the country should pay attention to, and we hope that the Allied nations will do their best to assist.</p>
<p>First, the control methods must be improved. The purpose of control is to encourage production and facilitate distribution, but the current control results sometimes make producers passive, thus making producers unwilling to produce. Since production has decreased, the distribution problem is of course more difficult to solve. Rice control is the best example. After a series of failures, we must find ways to improve. There is no doubt that the country should implement a control policy during wartime, so the problem is not in the system itself, but in the control methods and personnel issues. We have said a lot about rice control. These words are not only hopes for rice control, but other control industries must also improve in view of the failure of rice control.</p>
<p>Second, an overall plan to support agriculture and industry must be decided. Taking yarn factories as an example, if we want to continue mass production, we must set an overall plan. Those that meet the operating conditions must be made to operate, and raw materials and electricity must be supplied. Those that do not meet the operating conditions should be clearly instructed to stop work. The government must take an active role, support and encourage those who can increase production, and naturally gain control over the products. From the production of raw materials in agriculture to the manufacture of finished products in industry, and then to the distribution of finished products, these three steps are connected and whole, and a complete plan is needed. Dealing with them piecemeal cannot solve the problem. Although we cannot achieve the full support of agriculture and industry at present, we must at least establish a few models to gradually promote it.</p>
<p>Increasing production during wartime is certainly a difficult task, but not producing or reducing production during wartime has the danger of contributing to the overall unfavorable situation. Therefore, in any difficult environment, we must find ways to promote the realization of increased production.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Advance on Palel, Capturing Seven Enemy Forts; Battles Around Kohima Become Increasingly Fierce</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 25th – The elite Japanese troops on the Burma front launched another attack on the enemy troops who were desperately defending Palel on the 17th. Under the close cooperation of infantry, engineers, and artillery units, they gradually advanced on the enemy's strongholds. At 11:00 PM on the 18th, a Japanese infantry suicide squad, carrying landmines, approached the enemy's positions in the darkness to carry out explosive demolition work, and used new weapons to shoot at the enemy troops. By dawn, they had captured seven enemy forts, completing the offensive route.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 25th – The enemy's counterattacks against the Japanese positions around Kohima have become increasingly fierce, and a large number of troops have been reinforced from the north in an attempt to open the road from Kohima to Imphal. To attack the enemy troops on Highland 5120 northeast of Kohima, after the attack failed on the 19th, at 5:40 PM on the 21st, 200 enemy troops, with tanks and artillery, attacked the highest point of the highland. However, after a fierce battle, they were finally repelled by the Japanese troops. In this two-day fierce battle, the enemy troops abandoned 115 bodies, and the Japanese troops destroyed four of their mortars. In addition, the enemy troops also increased their forces toward the Arraz area south of Kohima, advancing near Highland 1400. At the same time, they also transferred elite troops carrying mortars to the vicinity of Longpan Zimi, 30 kilometers east of Kohima.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 25th – According to a report from Contai, the Allied Southeast Asia Command announced that the Japanese troops in the Bishenpur area of the Imphal front had recently increased their strength and launched an attack under the cover of artillery fire on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Completing the Encirclement and Launching a Three-Pronged Offensive, Japanese Troops Captured Luoyang Yesterday Morning, Continuing to Pursue the Fleeing Enemy and Expand the Results of the Battle</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced (6:30 PM, May 25th): The base of the First War Zone of the Chongqing Army, Luoyang, which was under encirclement and surveillance, was attacked by Japanese troops starting in the afternoon of May 24th, and the area was completely captured today (May 25th). The main battle results obtained by the Japanese army in this battle, which have been identified so far, are as follows: The Japanese side recovered more than 2,000 bodies of Chongqing soldiers, captured more than 4,000 prisoners, and seized 15 artillery pieces and 800 firearms.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Xinzheng, 25th – In Henan, Japanese troops used a portion of their forces to encircle Luoyang, the base of the First War Zone of the Chongqing Army, while using the main force to pursue the main forces of the Chongqing field armies of Tang Enbo, Jiang Dingwen, and Hu Zongnan. They launched a general offensive on Luoyang on the 24th and completely occupied it at 8:30 AM on the 25th. The Japanese army did not want to destroy Luoyang because it is a cultural area with many famous historical sites. Moreover, the main purpose of this operation was to destroy the Chongqing field army, so the damage to Luoyang was minimal. Therefore, powerful Japanese troops arrived in the suburbs of Luoyang one after another starting on May 10th, completing the encirclement. However, they were not in a hurry to attack. At that time, they encircled Luoyang with a portion of their forces and used the main force to sweep away the Chongqing field army. At that time, the Chongqing army believed that the loss of Luoyang would have a major impact on politics and military affairs, so they strictly ordered the approximately three divisions of Chongqing soldiers in Luoyang to defend to the death. At that time, the Japanese army believed that the defending troops in the city did not accept the Japanese army's advice, so they had no choice but to launch a general offensive at 3:00 PM on the 24th, forcing their way into the city from the northeast, west, and three sides. As a result, they were completely occupied at 8:30 AM on the 25th. In this battle, the Chongqing army abandoned more than 2,000 bodies and more than 4,000 were captured. The Japanese army also seized 15 artillery pieces and approximately 800 firearms, achieving a great victory.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Annihilating the Troops of the First and Eighth War Areas</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Xinzheng, 25th – In this operation in Henan, the Japanese army thoroughly annihilated the troops of the enemy's First War Zone and Eighth War Zone, a total of seven armies and twenty-eight divisions. During the entire operation, the Japanese army achieved this great victory with the speed of lightning. This was due to the effective guidance of the Japanese army's operations, as well as the brave struggle of all officers and soldiers. Tang Enbo had tried his best to avoid conflict with the Japanese army since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, while secretly building up his forces. Recently, the anti-Japanese strength of his troops has been enriched, and it is predicted that they are sufficient to cope with the Japanese army's offensive. Moreover, since around February of this year, it was speculated that the Japanese army would launch an offensive operation, so he made every effort to prepare for the war. Therefore, when the Japanese army started this operation, the Chongqing army took active tactics, which instead became a good bait for the Japanese army. Although he lost most of his troops along the Jinghan Railway and the Funiu Mountains during the first phase of the annihilation operation, he still gathered his defeated troops and the remnants of the troops commanded by Jiang Dingwen, the First War Zone Army, and the Hu Zongnan Army of the Eighth War Zone in Xin'an, west of Luoyang. After the tenth annihilation battle, the Japanese army immediately advanced straight to Luoyang, and it was determined that they were carrying out an offensive operation in the area, and began a major counterattack behind the Japanese army. However, the Japanese army led these enemy troops north, crossed the Yellow River in a surprise attack from the vicinity of Yuanqu, Shanxi Province, cutting off the Longhai Line and cutting off its connection with the Eighth War Zone. After the main force of the Japanese army forced its way to Luoyang, it turned around and approached the main force of the enemy army gathered near Yiyang Jining, chasing them to the Luoyang River and Yi River valley areas, and using a large group of tank units and cavalry units to drive straight to Lushi, blocking the enemy army's retreat. They launched a three-pronged assault on the enemy's positions in the river valley area, achieving a strategic victory of annihilation. The Japanese army is currently continuing to shake the defeated remnants of the enemy army and expand the results of the battle. In the area of Henan Province, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, this is a rare phenomenon in the Japanese army's offensive operations. That is, before the Japanese army started the offensive this time, the residents of Henan cooperated with the Japanese army and successively rose up to disarm the defeated troops of the enemy army. Henan, known as the fertile land of the Central Plains of China, has also been burdened for many years by the war, and the people cannot bear it. At the same time, the general public rebelled against Tang Enbo's harsh taxes and levies, and seized the good opportunity for the Japanese army to attack and rose up. Today, the faces of the residents in the newly occupied areas of the Japanese army are all happy, and prices have been reduced by 10%. According to the Chongqing-American air force, they took a bystander attitude at the beginning of this operation and had no active intention to fight. However, in the later stage of the operation, due to Chiang Kai-shek's weeping appeal, they used Chengdu, Liangshan, Hanzhong, Xing'an, and other places as bases, and approximately 200 combat-bomber joint formations flew from the southwest region. On the 12th, the Japanese air force launched a surprise attack on Suichuan Airport, destroying 45 of their aircraft in one fell swoop. In addition to the embarrassment, their attitude towards cooperating with the Chongqing army was extremely cold.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 25th – According to a report from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Headquarters announced that the Japanese army had occupied Lushi on the 22nd.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Xinzheng, 25th – The Japanese army's assault troops advancing on Song County attacked Jiang Dingwen's troops, which were retreating southwestward across the Luoyang Plain, everywhere. They advanced along the mountain road to Song County and Lushi, and have now reached the Lushi area, the forward base of the US military in Chongqing. From the 19th to the morning of the 20th, they repelled approximately 1,000 Chongqing soldiers near the city and occupied it.</p>
<p>Japanese Down 11 Enemy Aircraft</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 25th – On the 17th and 18th, the Japanese army's land forces in Henan shot down two Chongqing P140 aircraft that attacked in the Xintoubi area of Changshuizhen (two kilometers southwest of Changshuizhen) with machine guns. Since the 3rd, the Japanese army has shot down 11 Chongqing aircraft in the Yu County and southwest Luoyang areas (three of which are unconfirmed).</p>

<h3>Navy Day Special Collection Six</h3>
<p>Special Attack Squads in the Russo-Japanese War</p>
<p>…In the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the battles of Sinai, Diego Suarez in South Africa, and Challes in May 1942, the Japanese special attack squads left immortal achievements. This cannot help but remind us of the heroic feat of the five warriors who, 39 years ago in the Russo-Japanese War, carried torpedoes to raid Port Arthur. It is a pity that this act ultimately failed at the time. Inoue Mikichi (age 60), a retired Navy Sub-Lieutenant, one of the five warriors, is still alive today. The following is what he said about the situation at the time:</p>
<p>…At the time of the Russo-Japanese War, I was a Third Class Petty Officer serving on the battleship Fuji. From February to August of the 37th year of Meiji (1904), the entire fleet and its officers and soldiers toiled extremely hard to blockade and attack Port Arthur, and there were also many sacrifices. The enemy, fearing an attack from the sea, laid down solid defenses in the harbor. So we planned to break through these defenses and launch a surprise attack on the harbor.</p>
<p>…So I, serving on the battleship Fuji, and the five people, including Anchorman Fan Ping and Asouchi Tsuchimatsu, discussed carrying torpedoes and swimming into the harbor to destroy the enemy ships. We applied to the commander, obtained permission, and began training. This was to use two poles with a torpedo on top. The four people each supported one end of the pole, and one person was the torpedo gunner who would fire when approaching the enemy ship. At that time, the torpedoes weighed about the same as floating on the sea.</p>
<p>…Preparations were completed, and training was perfected. So on the night of July 30 of the 37th year of Meiji (1904), we transferred from the Fuji to a torpedo boat and proceeded to the vicinity of Port Arthur. The five of us transferred again to a sampan and rowed to the harbor carrying the torpedoes. Looking back, it was dark, and the wind and waves were high, and the sampan almost capsized. When we arrived at the harbor, the five of us stripped naked, wearing only a pair of pants and a firefighter-like headgear, and jumped into the sea.</p>
<p>…But the wind and waves became more and more turbulent, and the searchlights of the enemy gun emplacements shone like daylight, making the defenses impenetrable. Of course, none of us wanted to return alive, but unfortunately, there was ultimately no way to break through, so we had to give up and retreat. However, we did receive an award. (翔: Translated from Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Marshal Togo's Golden Words</h3>
<p>The Best Way to Remedy Shortcomings is Courage</p>
<p>It is not necessarily a matter of concern that the enemy's artillery is strong and ours is weak. Though our swords may be short, a swift advance can still strike a fatal blow. To evade the enemy because their bullets reach us while ours do not reach them is to be without courage and without wisdom. It is difficult to expect victory in this manner. If our bullets cannot reach the enemy, we should advance to a position where they can and fire fiercely.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Soldiers is Even More Important Than the Sharpness of Weapons</p>
<p>Looking at the Russian soldiers during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, one would have to call them strong soldiers rather than weak. Yet, after engaging with the Japanese army, they suffered defeat after defeat. Why was this? It was because the majority of them believed that fighting was the duty of the army or navy. Consequently, the outcome of the battle was limited to the existence of the army or navy. Once these were defeated, they thought their duty as soldiers was over and rarely continued to fight as individuals. I believe this was a major reason why they could not defeat the Japanese army. As for the Japanese soldiers, they would fulfill their duty and die for their country, not just as a ship or a team, but even as a single soldier. This kind of awareness is stronger than iron and stone. Only this is the treasure that protects the nation. In the future, along with the progress of weapons, we must cultivate this kind of spirit even more.</p>
<p>Honor and Surrender Are Absolutely Incompatible</p>
<p>They may have a concept of "honorable surrender," but for Japanese soldiers, honor and surrender are absolutely incompatible at any time.</p>
<p>To Die Rather Than Be Defeated is the First Duty of Our Soldiers; Any Other Pretext in Wartime is Mere Words.</p>
<p>The Awakening of Bushido</p>
<p>The unexpected progress of our country's medieval navy was not only due to tactics and technology but also to the awakening of Bushido. If this spirit is applied to today's naval warfare, Western strategists will see things they never expected. For example, the T-crossing and zigzagging tactics are merely creative ideas suggested by this spirit.</p>
<p>Lamenting the Enemy General From the Perspective of Bushido</p>
<p>Admiral Rozhestvensky was truly an extraordinary man. It is easy to imagine the painstaking effort it took to navigate such a large fleet on a journey of 15,000 nautical miles. However, it is difficult to agree with his hesitation and indecision along the way, instead of boldly advancing to reach Vladivostok as soon as possible. However, our fundamental moral values are different. It may be unreasonable to expect him to act according to our standards. But if I were to express my hope for him directly, it would be that he would continue to fight valiantly in the Battle of Tsushima and die for his country. To live on dishonorably and willingly become a prisoner of war is a regrettable thing for him.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Government Strictly Prohibits Manipulation and Hoarding of Rice: Regulations for Rice Merchants to Obtain Licenses and Purchase Rice</h3>
<p>In order to suppress rice prices and regulate the food supply, the government has issued an order to ease restrictions on the movement of rice in the Shanghai area and to revise the transportation rules, which will be implemented first in Beijing and Shanghai. The municipal government, fearing that after the implementation of this policy, some people may seek to seize exorbitant profits, manipulate rice prices, and engage in hoarding to harm the food supply, has issued a notice to all merchants and residents to be aware that, in addition to ordering strict investigations, they should share the difficulties of the times, assist the government in implementing policies, and not test the law or face punishment. The original text of the notice is as follows: "Notice: The movement of rice has been eased and restrictions have been lifted, and the transportation rules have been revised. However, after the implementation of this policy, if anyone seeks to seize exorbitant profits, manipulate rice prices, or engage in hoarding to harm the food supply, they will be severely punished according to the law once discovered. This matter concerns the welfare of all citizens, and it is hoped that merchants and residents will share the difficulties of the times, assist the government in implementing policies, and not test the law or face punishment. In addition to ordering strict investigations, this notice is issued for public knowledge."</p>
<p>After the authorities established the "Temporary Measures for the Supply of Rice to the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai," it was stipulated that all rice procurement merchants approved by the Rice Grain Control Committee, rice shops registered in Beijing and Shanghai, and nearby farmers transporting their own harvested rice to the city for sale may apply for rice grain transportation permits. However, the Rice Grain Control Committee may requisition a certain amount of rice for military use and important industries. The main points of the application process for rice grain procurement permits and rice grain transportation permits are excerpted below: Anyone holding a rice grain procurement permit or a rice grain transportation permit must conduct procurement or transportation according to the provisions of the permit. Applicants for rice grain procurement permits must fill out an application form in duplicate. Applicants for rice grain transportation permits must fill out an application form in quadruplicate. Procurement permits and transportation permits are limited to one-time use and must be returned to the issuing Rice Grain Control Committee for cancellation after use. Anyone procuring or transporting rice grain with expired or invalid procurement permits or transportation permits will be punished in accordance with Article 10 of the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice Grain Transportation and Sales in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces."</p>
<h3>Celebrating Allied Naval Day: Lecture Tonight, Organized by Five Groups Including the New United Association</h3>

The presidium consists of Wen Lanting, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Binyu, and Feng Jie. The general director of the conference is Ren Yunpeng. Colonel Matsushima, the head of the Fleet Press Department, will give a special lecture. The Japanese Army and Navy bands will perform various pieces. Finally, the Japanese film "Kamuning" will be screened. All speeches will be broadcast live by the Shanghai Radio Station. Local and out-of-town residents can tune in to the conference starting at 7:30 PM. The China Film Company will film the newsreel.</p>
<p>Also, the tickets for the second and third sports fields of the sports meeting held by the News United Association have been sold out. Those from all walks of life who wish to watch the track and field competitions (performed at the racecourse) can prepare a formal letter to the Shanghai News United Association at 160 Da Shanghai Road to request them.</p>
<h3>Inventory of Warehouse Materials to be Reported by Deadline</h3>
<p>In order to accurately ascertain the quantity of various material inventories, the First District Office of this city, in addition to handling the registration of daily necessities, has also stipulated that all businesses operating warehouses (including cold storage warehouses) or trust and custody businesses within the district should prepare a detailed list of the names and addresses of the depositors, as well as the names and quantities of all materials deposited or stored and the date of entry, as of the end of business on May 20 of this year, and submit it to Office 701 of the Economic Section of the office at 209 Jiangxi Road by May 31 at the latest. Thereafter, by the 20th of each month, they should prepare a similar detailed list and report it to Office 701 of the Economic Section of the office at the end of the month for verification.</p>
<h3>During Air Defense Training, Pay Attention to Alarms and Implement Evacuation Drills Effectively</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters issued a notice on the 24th, stipulating that civil air defense training will be conducted in the Shanghai area on any two days from the 26th to the 31st. Whether the training will be continuous or intermittent will not be announced in advance. Therefore, all citizens of this city should pay attention to alarms at any time during these six days.</p>
<p>Training Content</p>
<p>Regarding the content of the training, after an air raid alarm is issued, ordinary citizens, except for soldiers, should use buildings, etc., to take refuge for about 20 minutes, and air defense personnel should also do the same. Therefore, traffic will be suspended during these 20 minutes. Movie theaters, theaters, and dance halls, as entertainment venues that can accommodate a large number of people, should implement evacuation drills after the alarm is issued and should not continue to operate merely as a formality. Also, when evacuating, pedestrians should obey the command of the respective air defense units and should not act arbitrarily. Secondly, regarding light control, it is divided into three stages: normal control, warning control, and air raid control, and corresponding measures should be taken quickly according to the alarms. This time, it is especially hoped that residents of tall buildings and households with skylights will pay more attention. Also, after a warning alarm is issued, do not go out unless there is an urgent matter. Those who have already gone out should return home as soon as possible. After an air raid alarm is issued, going out is absolutely prohibited except for those with urgent business. The Air Defense Headquarters and other military and political organs will designate areas to conduct large and small training at any time. Therefore, in addition to the air defense units in the designated areas acting accordingly, ordinary pedestrians should also cooperate at any time and should not stand by and watch indifferently. Also, air defense training is not only limited to after the alarm is issued, but each air defense unit should also conduct training separately when the alarm has not been issued, in order to become proficient. In addition, there is also a need for thorough research and training in communication methods when power lines are cut. When an airplane drops a dummy bomb, it should be treated the same as a real bomb and should not be ignored. Finally, after the alarm is issued and lifted, check the equipment to ensure it is complete and make efforts to prevent injuries caused by the training.</p>

<h3>The Development of the War Situation and Our Awareness: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Continental New Report Broadcasts to Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>Mr. Osako, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Continental New Report, gave a speech for about 20 minutes from 7:20 PM on the day before yesterday (the 24th) at the Greater Asia Broadcasting Station, titled "The Development of the War Situation and Our Awareness," to the Japanese residents in Central China. The main points of the speech are as follows, explaining the current stage of the decisive battle approaching in the Greater East Asia War, and at the same time expressing the hopes for the 600,000 Japanese residents in the current situation, giving a great sense of inspiration.</p>
<p>December 8, Showa 16 (1941), is a day that will never be forgotten by the Japanese people, and indeed by the one billion people of Greater East Asia, as the glorious Greater East Asia War began on that day. Since that memorable day, more than two years and five months have passed, and the continuous warfare has lasted for 874 days. As for the war situation during that time, as everyone knows, it has been either magnificent or fierce, with both sides exhausting their national strength and launching a life-or-death battle unprecedented in the history of world wars. Looking at it comprehensively or from a global perspective, it is truly a continuous series of decisive battles every day, and it is no exaggeration to say that neither side has relaxed its fighting spirit for even a day.</p>
<p>In this magnificent decisive battle between us and the enemy, truly a decisive battle within decisive battles, we are facing each other with bayonets aimed at the heart, so-called mutually taking each other's lives, as the rise and fall of the nation depends on it, and the decisive battle stage of the decisive battle is imminent, which you all know well. At this critical time in the war situation, looking at the fact that tomorrow is Naval Memorial Day, it is particularly meaningful. We, in this situation, should clearly and deeply imprint in our minds how the Greater East Asia War situation will develop in which direction and what thoughts we should have towards the current enemy, Britain and the United States. In any case, for this war that concerns the fate of our motherland, we should be calm, and our awareness of victory should be as solid as a rock.</p>
<p>Originally, this Greater East Asia War unfolded extremely rapidly at the beginning of the war, due to our side's fierce offensive. Just as the art of war says, "Strike first." Our army and navy skillfully and vigilantly utilized this good opportunity of "strike first." Judging from the facts, in less than a year since the start of the war on December 8, the great war results achieved by our army and navy were that in the East, the American Pacific Fleet was completely wiped out by the fierce attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and in the West, following the fall of Hong Kong and Singapore, they swept through Malaya and Burma like a whirlwind sweeping away fallen leaves. Furthermore, in the South, they captured the Philippines and took the vast Dutch East Indies archipelago into their grasp. They advanced further and became active in the Solomon Islands area, and for a time their momentum was so great that they even completely controlled Australia's life. At that time, the disappointment and embarrassment of Britain and the United States were almost unbearable to witness.</p>
<p>Rising from Defeat in the Initial Battles</p>
<p>However, the enemy would never just weep and give up. As you all know, the United States has never lost a war against a foreign country since its founding, so the war leaders, centered on President Roosevelt, under the slogan "Remember Pearl Harbor," began to expand their military preparations fiercely in order to think about revenge in the future.</p>
<p>What kind of military expansion did the Americans undertake? First, they expanded their air power, and second, they strengthened their warships and ships. Then, when the operation was possible and the preparations were complete, they launched the so-called counterattack against Japan. The American counterattack began with the Gilbert Islands operation on November 19 last year. Looking back at the enemy's advance, starting with the landing on Gilbert Islands on November 19 last year, to the landing on the Marshall Islands in January of this year, and the landing on the Admiralty Islands in February, and the landing on Hollandia in April, step by step they got closer, and here they were able to consolidate their footing for the decisive battle against Japan.</p>
<p>Increasing Hidden War Potential</p>
<p>If we observe how the enemy will promote the war in the future, the first problem is the Philippines. The enemy's operational steps are to use the gradually advancing footholds as always, on the one hand dispatching mobile units and concentrating fierce attacks on the Philippines, and when they expect to occupy the Philippines, they will carry out large-scale landing operations around Guangdong Province in China, and use this as the largest counterattack base to completely defeat Japan.</p>
<p>As for what Japan is doing now, of course, the Japanese army will not stand by and watch the enemy's counterattack posture. Starting with the bloody battle of Tarawa during the Gilbert Islands operation, Japanese soldiers everywhere launched fierce attacks against the enemy's counterattack, inflicting extremely great damage on the enemy. What should be clearly distinguished here is that the methods of operation are different, and now we are standing on the defensive offensive position. Looking at the overall situation, we are engaging in what Sun Tzu also knew and said: "Warfare is won by offense." Needless to say, the first principle of strategy is offense. So why are we not launching an offensive now? In fact, our defense now is by no means just for defense, but to use the great war results gained in the various battles as a basis, and now take this opportunity to exhaust the strength of 100 million people, tirelessly building a new and resilient war fighting force, in order to obtain the final victory.</p>
<p>In the case of Japan, at first it used force to suppress the enemy, and although the enemy was incapable of being suppressed, they have gradually recovered recently. At this time, we are also preparing to seize the appropriate opportunity to strike down at once the enemy who has once again strengthened their military equipment and improved the war situation.</p>
<p>The Key to Victory in a Decisive Battle Life</p>
<p>In such a critical situation, there are two things that we local residents must keep in mind. First, we must devote more effort to strengthening Japan's war fighting force. The increased production of aircraft, warships, and ships goes without saying, and it is necessary for us to transport them to the Japanese soldiers on the front line, so we must vigorously save and reduce living expenses.</p>
<p>Second, we local residents must work more closely with the Chinese to win the war that determines the fate of the Greater East Asian nations. Now is not the time to say "we must understand the Chinese." Country A and Japan live in the same village and are neighbors. The exchange between the two countries began a thousand or two thousand years ago. During that time, there were also things that happened that caused discord between the two countries, but there were also things that helped each other. So if we associate with sincerity, then understanding can be generated. Especially since we have come to the local area and are bothering China, so we must take the lead in treating the Chinese with sincerity. In this way, the Chinese will surely trust us, and we deeply believe this now.</p>
<p>Our Great Future</p>
<p>In short, in the present critical situation, we deeply believe that the most important tasks of us local residents are, first, to stand up to strengthen the war fighting force, and second, to treat the Chinese with sincerity. When we fully understand this determination, we deeply believe that Japan will have a great future, and the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can also open up our future together.</p>

<h3>History of the Development of the Japanese Navy</h3>
<p>Naval Review at Tempozan</p>
<p>On March 26th of the first year of Meiji (1868), a naval review was held off the coast of Tempozan in Osaka. This marked the true beginning of the history of the Japanese Navy. Shortly after Emperor Meiji ascended the throne, he toured the outskirts of Kyoto, entering the sea from the Aji River by boat for sightseeing.</p>
<p>"The sea is truly a magnificent thing!" This was the word passed around at the time. The wider the sea, the wider the stage for the Japanese Navy to play on. This exclamation of the Emperor held boundless hope for the Japanese Navy.</p>
<p>A total of ten steamships participated in this naval review: "Denryu Maru" (from Hizen Province), "Banri Maru" (from Higo Province), "Chitose Maru" (from Kurume Province), "Sanpo Maru" (from Satsuma Province), "Kayou Maru" (from Choshu Province), and "Bannen Maru" (from Ise Province). Among them, only the "Denryu Maru" had a formal warship construction. As a gunboat of only 800 tons, it served as the flagship, and the condition of the other ships can be imagined. Who would have thought that after seventy-five years, this would become the world's leading navy?</p>
<p>Cuisine on Ships</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the early Meiji period, warships belonged to individual domains and were not yet part of a national navy, resulting in extreme disorder. On the deck of the "Noryo Maru," a ship from Kumamoto, were arranged tatami mats. Officers and sailors alike urinated into the sea from the railings of the gangway. Despite extreme Westernization, the cuisine on board included fermented soybeans and salted radish.</p>
<p>Once, while inspecting the inside of a ship, a salted radish barrel was spotted.</p>
<p>"What is this?"</p>
<p>"Radishes pickled in salt."</p>
<p>"Really? That's good."</p>
<p>To strengthen the Japanese spirit, it was necessary to have unique Japanese cuisine. Therefore, warships were equipped with pickled radishes, fermented soybeans, and other items, a tradition that continues to this day.</p>
<p>During the early stages of the Sino-Japanese War, the author served aboard the flagship that initially landed ahead of the enemy at Wusong. The next day, I was invited to dine by Commander Kiyoshi Hasegawa and thoroughly enjoyed the tofu and fermented soybean soup on the ship, a taste I still haven't forgotten.</p>
<p>First Time Aboard a Warship</p>
<p>On May 23rd of the fifth year of Meiji (1872), Emperor Meiji embarked on the warship "Ryujo" for the first time, departing from Shinagawa, crossing the Seto Inland Sea via Ise, Osaka, and Kobe, and touring from Nagasaki to Satsuma before returning. The Tokugawa shogunate had strongly requested that the Emperor not venture out on tours, as previous emperors had never stepped outside Kyoto. However, the times had changed significantly. On this occasion, Emperor Meiji also donned a military uniform for the first time on tour. This, too, is worthy of special mention. As this set a precedent, Emperor Meiji later wore army uniforms at every naval review. After the Russo-Japanese War, at the request of Naval Minister Yamamoto, a new precedent was set, and naval uniforms were worn at naval reviews.</p>
<p>Domestically Produced Warships</p>
<p>From the beginning of military construction in the Meiji era, the fundamental principle was to manufacture all weapons domestically, and this is where the strength of the Japanese military lies.</p>
<p>The Yokosuka Naval Arsenal had already built its first warship in the eleventh year of Meiji (1878). That was the "Seiki" warship. Emperor Meiji himself attended the launching ceremony. The "Seiki" was a wooden warship with a speed of nine and a half knots and a crew of one hundred and seventy-one. Looking back now, it seems like a cute, toy-like warship. Marshal Yoshika Inoue once served as the captain of this ship. The year after the end of the Satsuma Rebellion, in the eleventh year of Meiji (1878), it undertook its first overseas voyage, passing through European countries such as France and Spain.</p>
<p>During the Russo-Japanese War, after losing the two giant warships, "Yashima" and "Hatsuse", off the coast of Lushun, an Imperial Conference was held, resolving that they had to be replenished in Japan no matter what. Thus, Japan began building steel warships like those of today.</p>
<p>Shipbuilders opposed it, saying: "Because we cannot make steel plates and steel pipes that can withstand high heat." However, "Once a decision has been made by the Imperial Conference, it must be resolutely implemented."</p>
<p>So, they gradually began to build them, and battleships were created. The United States marvelled and said, "Looking at Japanese houses, they are hardly more advanced than nomadic tents. Yet they have built the world's most excellent warships, which is truly incredible."</p>
<p>Therefore, Dr. Hiraga and others are truly the gods of shipbuilding.</p>
<p>Battle of the Yellow Sea</p>
<p>No smoke, no clouds. No wind, no waves...</p>
<p>This is the war song everyone knows from the Battle of the Yellow Sea in the Sino-Japanese War. China possessed the largest warships in the East, the "Dingyuan" and "Zhenyuan," and when it combined the Beiyang, Nanyang, Fujian, and Guangdong fleets to fight us, it was three times the size of our Combined Fleet.</p>
<p>Japan was well aware that our navy was at a great disadvantage, and both the government and the public were deeply worried. First, we made the Chinese navy lose heart off the coast of Haiyu, and then we sank four warships in the Yellow Sea. The "Dingyuan" also suffered significant damage. It was the greatest naval battle since Nelson's Trafalgar.</p>
<p>Previously, the Russian strategist believed in the iron rule that battleships were bound to win, and Ding Ruchang, as a researcher of this, naturally adopted that tactic, but Japan broke it with unique new tactics, and the whole world was amazed. And the naval tactics after this were changed.</p>
<p>During this Battle of the Yellow Sea, it is known that there was a good omen: an eagle landed on the mast of the Takachiho. This eagle was later sent to the Hiroshima headquarters to be raised, and Emperor Meiji showed it great affection.</p>
<p>In the subsequent Battle of Weihaiwei, Ding Ruchang surrendered, and all warships were handed over to Japan. He committed suicide out of loyalty, leaving behind his name even after death. The end of a great general has been recounted for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Mother of Sailors</p>
<p>A sailor was crying on deck. An officer saw him and scolded him: "Base thing! Are you afraid of war? Are you longing for home?"</p>
<p>"No, it's not about those things. Please see." He took out a letter written in a woman's handwriting.</p>
<p>"I heard that you did not participate in the Battle of Haishima, nor in the attack on Weihaiwei. Your mother has no face to see the villagers. She prays to the gods every day that you will participate in the decisive battle soon."</p>
<p>The officer also shed tears for the mother's heart left behind. At that time, those who had not participated in naval battles comforted and encouraged each other with the idea that they lacked martial luck and that the war had only just begun. The strength of the Japanese Navy also lies in this kind of female prayer.</p>
<p>First Time Aboard a Submarine</p>
<p>In the thirty-second year of Meiji (1899), Dr. Holland of the United States built a submarine. "Seeking volunteers to experiment with underwater navigation," was announced to the world. Everyone felt it was dangerous, and no one applied. At that time, a Japanese man suddenly came forward: "Then, I am willing to give it a try." This was Lieutenant Junior Grade Takashi Sasaki of the Navy.</p>
<p>He happened to be stopping in the United States on an overseas voyage, so he took advantage of this opportunity. His experience on this submarine was presented to the authorities, and he requested the Navy Ministry: "I hope Japan will immediately start building submarines."</p>
<p>It was too early, and this suggestion could not be made at this time. Among thousands and thousands of white people, not one applied, which shows our unique spirit. This is the bud of the soul of the special submarines that attacked Pearl Harbor and Sydney.</p>
<p>Battle of Tsushima</p>
<p>Such a magnificent naval battle as the Battle of Tsushima can be called unprecedented and unequalled. The enemy was the Baltic Fleet. It was one of Europe's leading and well-trained fleets, and Kaiser Wilhelm had praised it as "resembling the Russian Emperor's headquarters floating on the sea."</p>
<p>Departing from Libau, it headed for the Straits of Tsushima -- a journey of thousands of miles. It took eight months. Such a great expedition had never been seen before in history. In today's era after the appearance of airplanes and submarines, it is absolutely impossible. From the opponent's perspective, they were truly flawless enemies.</p>
<p>Against this, what was our strategy?</p>
<p>In the Battles of Lushun and the Yellow Sea, we minimized our losses as much as possible while inflicting great damage on the enemy, because the Baltic Fleet was still remaining. In preparation for dealing with them, we had to make an all-or-nothing decisive battle. After this annihilation, there would be no other fleets. Only one ship escaped to Vladivostok. No matter how much damage was sustained, as long as it was all done, we would win this time.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Togo adopted a desperate tactic. "Turning back in front of the enemy" has always been a tactic that is bound to lose and is absolutely avoided, but Admiral Togo resolutely implemented it.</p>
<p>When the enemy saw Togo's ship moving, they were overjoyed and said, "Ah! We have won! We have won -- Togo doesn't understand tactics."</p>
<p>Enemy shells hit the "Mikasa."</p>
<p>But at that critical moment, our fleet turned sideways, and we formed a "T" shape with them. The enemy could not pass, and the entire force of more than thirty enemy ships was wiped out. It was a refreshing victory.</p>
<p>In the Battle of the Yellow Sea during the Sino-Japanese War, the genius of the Japanese Navy, who broke the Lissay tactic and created a new tactic, created another new tactic in the Battle of Tsushima. Europe calls it the "Togo Turn." In the Battle of Jutland, Admiral Jellicoe of the United Kingdom adopted this tactic, sinking two British capital ships. A new record of glory in naval warfare created by Japan.</p>
<p>Therefore, May 27th is not only Japanese Navy Day, but also a naval memorial day for the whole world that will be forever immortalized in military history.</p>
<p>The Detestable Washington Naval Conference</p>
<p>However, the Japanese Navy did not complete its path to becoming the world's leading power smoothly. From another point of view, it was a road full of thorns.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth year of Meiji (1886), the warship "Tsukuba" went missing in the waters off Taiwan. It was an excellent ship ordered by Japan from France, and it held the greatest hope, so the shock of the Japanese government and public was like that of Britain when it lost the "Prince of Wales." The bud of building a great navy was snapped in this way, but "unyielding and untroubled" is the creed of the Japanese Navy. The greater the difficulties, the greater the courage. During the Russo-Japanese War, of the only eight battleships, "Yashima" and "Hatsuse" both sank at one time. At the end of the Meiji period, there was the tragedy of Lieutenant Commander Sakuma, which was a noble sacrifice.</p>
<p>But the most detestable thing was the Washington Naval Conference in the tenth year of Taisho (1921). Britain and the United States jointly plotted to force a ratio of 5:5:3. This was the greatest resentment since the Triple Intervention on the Far Eastern Peninsula. Britain and the United States, under the pretext of reducing the burden on their people due to increased naval expenditures and reducing the factors of war anxiety, used this得意diplomatic means to add to the heavy pressure on Japan.</p>
<p>Admiral Minoru Kato reported to Marshal Togo, saying, "It is truly an unreasonable oppression." The Marshal comforted him, saying, "But Britain and the United States cannot impose restrictions on training no matter what."</p>
<p>Since then, a new light has been discovered. Unprecedented fierce training courses have been put into effect. The seven days of the week, from Sunday to Saturday, have become "Mon-Tue-Wed-Thu-Fri-Sat-Sat." Let us wait and see what the results will be.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War</p>
<p>In the Edo period, there was a...</p>
<p>"...the leaf lets the snake dwell in its body, and when it exerts its strength, even a sword cannot match its sharpness."</p>
<p>No sentence is more fitting to describe the appearance of the Greater East Asia War than this.</p>
<p>The four countries of Britain, the United States, China, and the Netherlands jointly formed the ABCD line. The Bible says: "The love of a dove and the wisdom of a serpent." But they are yellow-cheeked snakes without the love of doves.</p>
<p>Japan is a pheasant with no other thought than to sing the praises of the sovereign's prosperity and the virtues of civilization in the spring countryside. The snake wants to eat this pheasant, using insidious means such as breaking commercial treaties, reducing quota systems, and freezing assets, surrounding it circle after circle. The pheasant folds its wings, holds its breath, and allows it to do as it pleases, without any resistance.</p>
<p>But everything has its limits. If the snake does not reflect, it must take the final and complete means.</p>
<p>Rise up in anger, and the snake will be cut into pieces.</p>
<p>Pearl Harbor, the sea off Malaya, Manila, the Aleutian Islands, and even the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>How to deal with those scattered pieces of snake meat is a problem for Japan in the future, but the leaf must be on guard, and it must not become complacent. (From the Weekly Mainichi)</p>
<h3>The Four-Front Army Organized by the Enemy, America</h3>
<p>The four-front army deliberately organized by Roosevelt. Its contents are as follows: In the Chinese mainland, it is the Chongqing troops. The Commander-in-Chief is Chiang Kai-shek, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Commander-in-Chief of the US Army stationed in China and India is Stilwell, and the Commander of the Sino-American Mixed Air Force is Chennault. In Southeast Asia, it is the Mountbatten Army. The Commander-in-Chief is Mountbatten, the Commander of the British Fleet in the Indian Ocean is Somerville, and the Supreme Commander of the British and American Air Forces stationed in India is Peirse. In the Southwest Pacific, it is the MacArthur Army. The Commander-in-Chief is MacArthur, the Deputy Commander and Commander of the Ground Forces is Blamey, the Commander of the Air Force is Kenney, and the Commander of the US Seventh Fleet and Commander of the Navy is Kinkaid. In the Pacific, it is the Nimitz Army. The Commander-in-Chief is US Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz, and the Deputy Commander is Dowes.</p>
<p>Regarding the amount of reinforcements for the four-front army, the MacArthur Army accounts for one-tenth to one-thirteenth of the US's total battle lines for supplies, and the Mountbatten Army is similar to the MacArthur Army. The Chongqing Army is on the first level of supplies. As for the Nimitz Army, at the end of last year, Nimitz boasted: "The United States currently has 880 warships, and most of the main fleet is concentrated in the Pacific. The fleet's organization has been changed to a transport-type formation centered on aircraft carriers." Therefore, the Nimitz Army is equal to the entire navy, and its strength is far greater than the other three armies. (Translated from Allied World Weekly, No. 1247)</p>

<h3>Rural Scenery</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>The pink peach blossoms, gently blown by the warm spring breeze, slipped down from the branches and landed on the muddy pond. They resented their own foolishness, regretting that they had left their mother to be trampled on here; when people's heavy footsteps trampled on their delicate bodies, they had cried out for help, groaned in despair, but people did not hear them and still cruelly trampled over them; sometimes they drifted down and landed on the creek, ripples rose on the creek, quickly engulfing them, no matter how sadly they sobbed! Silken willow strands, like a young woman's slender waist, sway gently in the breeze; clusters of white willow catkins, fluttering everywhere with the smiling spring breeze, the sweet fragrance of wheat fills the air, and the drooping wheat ears emit a dazzling yellow color in the sunlight. Lively fish often leap out of the water, raising "splish" and "splash" sounds on the water surface, and water droplets splash everywhere; afterward, the water surface returns to its calmness, and spring has already passed its peak. At this time, a five or six-year-old girl, carrying a bamboo basket on her back; with a sickle in her hand, a round face, dark and bright eyes, a high, straight nose, cherry-like blood-red lips slightly pouting, a thin layer of tears shimmering in her eyes. Her small hands were rubbing her eyes, a pair of dirty little feet, supporting a small body, shuffled on the muddy ground, the muddy ground emitting a faint sigh of relief. Suddenly, a cry of "Xiao Ling!" came from the woods, followed by a very beautiful girl, wearing shiny silk clothes, shouting as she ran, thinking of joking with her, she leaped and bounded over, shaking her shoulder with her hand, panting and saying, "Why are you ignoring me?" But when she saw tears on Xiao Ling's face, she exclaimed in surprise, "Ah! Why are you crying again?" Xiao Ling only mumbled a "Missing!" She used many words to tease her companion to talk, but Xiao Ling never opened her mouth, only cried sadly; later, she was also moved to tears by Xiao Ling, Xiao Ling then sobbed and said, "It's all your fault, you asked me to play at your house, my mother said I didn't cut enough grass, and scolded me, saying I was lazy, calling me a cheap girl, refusing to work all day long, just fooling around with rich young ladies, look, Mom beat my face..." "Wah!" She touched her scars and cried sadly again. "Why doesn't your mom ever like you?" She tilted her face and asked Xiao Ling naively. Xiao Ling cried and said, "Because I'm not her own daughter, so she doesn't like me, my own mother has already died, she is the one my dad married later, she loves my brother, because my brother is her own..." Xiao Ling kept rubbing her eyes, and the intermittent sobbing sound filled the air!</p>
<p>At this moment, everything in the universe seemed to have disappeared, only the sound of two small hearts beating, and the greatest friendship of mankind had tightly bound their hearts together.</p>
<h3>Rebirth</h3>
<p>— Rong Ge</p>
<p>Today, settle the old accounts of the past, everything in the past must be discarded, no longer fantasize about beautiful dreams, no longer let sadness occupy the heart, no longer shed the tears of the weak, wave goodbye, stand up tall, starting from today, walk out of the gray swamp, hold on to a healthy heart, and unfold a new page of hope!</p>
<h3>In Memory of a Deceased Friend</h3>
<p>— Tang Min</p>
<p>In just two years, I can count quite a few relatives and friends who have become people of the past. What is most painful is that most of them are still very young, they are stubbornly trying to take root in this world, but an irresistible force presses down on them, and they have to abandon their partners in suffering. Think about it: when they breathe their last breath, looking at such a broken world, can they close their eyes peacefully?</p>
<p>Except for a very few who died of illness, the rest died in very strange ways. Every time I hear such terrible news, I can't help but wonder with trepidation: how should I end my life? Then, I hold my head and cry.</p>
<p>Last year, I learned from a letter sent from faraway Liaoyuan that a former classmate had died. Similarly, this was something that could not be believed, he was so young and strong, but the letter clearly stated his tragic news, he drowned in the stream!</p>
<p>The friend who wrote this letter has a delicate writing style, and he described the circumstances of his death in detail with somber words, which reminded me of our half-year life together, and stirred up emotions from my memories, making me...</p>
<p>I used to live with him in the same dormitory, at that time, it was the first time I had left home, and things that I initially thought were not a problem turned out to be problems, and he always helped me to solve those difficulties. Once, I was troubled by the matter of washing clothes: washing them myself, pouring basin after basin of water in the kitchen was really too tiring; asking others to wash them, I often found lice in the clean clothes, what could I do? I don't know why, I smashed the washbasin on the ground and got angry. He smiled and said:</p>
<p>"It's better to wash them in the pool, there's plenty of water and it's very clean!"</p>
<p>From then on, I listened to his words, knelt on one leg on the rocks by the pool, leaned over to wash clothes. Sometimes, he and I were doing the same work, he rubbed soap on the clothes, pounded them with stones, and after a while, he rinsed them clean in the water, and lifted up a piece of clothing and it was washed. I praised him for his skilled technique, but he didn't treat me politely:</p>
<p>"What's there to praise about this?... I've been wandering outside for several years, of course I can handle this kind of thing." Who knew that his words were still echoing in my heart, but he, in a city, in order to handle this matter, slipped on a rock by the pool and fell into the water and drowned!</p>
<p>I remember how reluctant we were when we parted two years ago! My husband had urged me to set out several times, but when we thought about the hardships we had suffered together in life for half a year, we held hands tightly and could not separate.</p>
<p>"I wish you a safe journey!... When you return home, be sure to be affectionate with your mother!"</p>
<p>He was saying these words to me, what else could I say to him besides wishing him good health? I would be treating people's comfort as... a miserable person. I could only keep many words in my heart, expressing my feelings with my eyes.</p>
<p>The coachmen carrying me had already crossed a rice field, and he was still chasing after me, shouting:</p>
<p>"Don't forget me, remember not to forget me!"</p>
<p>I knew the hardships contained in this sentence, he was a lonely person, and he hoped that his friends could have spiritual resonance with him. Indeed, I have never forgotten him, especially the picture of him washing clothes with his lean body, it often appears clearly in my mind!</p>
<p>But he died, he didn't die in a wood, but died in the matter of washing clothes!... He died so accidentally, if there was a "what if", he would still be alive now, stubbornly alive!</p>
<p>The letter also stated that his body was desecrated after his death. Although this friend couldn't bear to describe the tragic state of his coffin being smashed, but when I closed my eyes, the situation seemed very clear. I saw the broken pieces of wood scattered on the ground, several dogs were watching over his naked corpse and gnawing on his flesh, chewing on his bones, and howling triumphantly in the forest, and several other dogs were panting as they rushed over, licking the bloodstains left on the ground, competing with red eyes... (Melancholy Grass, Part 3)</p>
<h3>The Swallows Have Come</h3>
<p>— Cheng Huican</p>
<p>The swallows have come!</p>
<p>Again, it is the spring season when birds are singing everywhere, and there are a few black spots floating in the blue, boundless sky. The warm sunshine stirs up a flurry of fluttering dust, gently sprinkling on people's bodies, sometimes scattering into their eyes, so people naturally rub their eyelids and then widen their eyes, looking around for something.</p>
<p>The swallows have come!</p>
<p>Slender wings, carrying light bodies, fly back and forth in the air, flying, flying. The scissor-like long tail retains some of the dusty scent of the south, and the dark black eyeballs show even more the hardships of the journey, but its "chirping" chirping still expresses the joy of freedom and the carefree life!</p>
<p>The swallows have come!</p>
<p>One, two, three,... each pointed beak contains a thin branch, they are working hard to build their camp, cooperating actively with one heart and one mind, not afraid of the wind blowing, not afraid of the rain beating, in such a self-built nest, they live by their own labor. When the osmanthus fragrance fills the air, they will leave without any nostalgia and turn to a vibrant place to pursue, forever pursuing without restraint!</p>
<p>Swallows, oh swallows! I admire your free joy, and even envy your carefree life. Although I am strong enough to support myself, I cannot leave the place I don't want to stay at will. The vibrant energy is only a moment of comfort to me, but I cannot pursue it freely forever. Swallows! I am willing to learn from you and wander with you. Are you willing to take me to the ends of the earth to seek a free life?</p>
<p>The swallows have come! They bring me some encouraging power, and slightly relieve my long-thirsty expectations!</p>
<h3>Green Parting</h3>
<p>— Gu Yiqing</p>
<p>Fleeting like the flashes of shooting stars,</p>
<p>Fleeting like the dusks of summer days,</p>
<p>Fleeting like beautiful youth,</p>
<p>Friends! This short gathering of ours;</p>
<p>Is the swallow's yearning for warmth and sunshine,</p>
<p>Is the moth's hope for brightness,</p>
<p>Is the lark's desire to soar into the clouds,</p>
<p>Tomorrow, you will resolutely leave me and go far away!</p>
<p>We were originally floating duckweed in the world——</p>
<p>The breeze made us depend on each other and become intimate,</p>
<p>The gentle waves made us confide our innermost feelings,</p>
<p>But, now the beautiful scenery in the dream will eventually fade away;</p>
<p>In this dim lamplight,</p>
<p>In this sorrowful journey,——</p>
<p>Listen! The biting spring wind is frequently urging us to part!</p>
<p>Here I smell a hint of green fragrance——</p>
<p>Silently wishing my like-minded friend: "Goodbye, take care!"</p>
<h3>"Sister Thirteen" and "Yan Qing and Li Shishi"</h3>
<p>— Gu Xin</p>
<p>"Sister Thirteen" is a "North China" product, and "Yan Qing and Li Shishi" is a "Manchukuo Film Association (Man'ei)" product. Both films are adapted from popular novels, but neither achieved satisfactory results.</p>
<p>When making films based on such stories, any kind of critical consciousness is completely out of the question. With heroes, beauties, and talented scholars, producers naturally just want to use these age-old, "well-known and widely recited" narratives to attract a "mass audience" with relatively low levels of knowledge. "Sister Thirteen" even uses Wu Suqiu, a "famous stage actress making her screen debut," as a selling point, focusing the entire film on her alone, showcasing martial arts, singing, and even inserting a fashionable scene of her before a battle scene, completely treating her as a vehicle for the film. Although some "progressive" words were added, they were entirely irrelevant.</p>
<p>As for "Yan Qing and Li Shishi," it seems they couldn't even settle on a theme. The screenwriter, on one hand, wanted to cater to the audience by focusing on the romance between Yan Qing and Li Shishi, while on the other hand, they wanted to shift the focus to Song Jiang's "seeking allegiance"—even after the script had been handed to the director, they (presumably together) were still undecided in their conflicting intentions.</p>
<p>What "Yan Qing and Li Shishi" presents to us is just a mess. The director also seemed overwhelmed by these one hundred and eight heroes, not knowing how to handle them. Fight scenes come and go chaotically, and emotional scenes are just a series of close-ups of Li Shishi's "affectionate glances." Transitions between segments (for example, between Song Jiang's return to Liangshan from Tokyo and Yan Qing's second visit to Tokyo) lack coherence. The audience's emotions are not captured at all.</p>
<p>In terms of technique, the director of "Sister Thirteen" is somewhat clever. The transitions from reality to fantasy, the symbolic representation of the passage of time, and other techniques are all decent, though not particularly outstanding. Some of the quiet scenes are also beautiful. But that is all he achieves. Furthermore, the portrayal of the characters and the coordination of sound and image are simply like a clash between Peking Opera and silent films, reeking of stale, outdated air.</p>
<p>The acting in both films is equally terrible. Even the personalities of the main characters are only vaguely outlined. Expressions are either stiff or superficial: the skin moves, but the flesh doesn't. The dialogue and editing in "Sister Thirteen" are even more cloying, still unable to shake off the outdated style of butterfly opera. Some actors in "Yan Qing and Li Shishi" seem to be imitating the strengths of Shanghai's Mingxing Film Company, which is, of course, good, but if they only imitate the form, then it's even worse.</p>

<h3>Tung Wah and South China United Team Success, Wins International Football Championship</h3>
<p>This past Monday, the Chinese team and the Italian team met at the Happy Valley Racecourse to compete for the international championship. Before the match, both sides sharpened their swords and prepared their horses, each with the ambition to win. Our Chinese team gathered the elite from both Tung Wah and South China, forming an iron army, united in purpose, and determined to win. On the day of the match, rumors spread that the Tung Wah and South China teams had disagreements over personnel matters. Fans were worried upon hearing this, but in the end, the players from both teams were in high spirits and ready to play. The facts speak louder than words, and the rumors were dispelled. Tens of thousands of spectators cheered and danced, their enthusiasm and anticipation beyond description. After a fierce battle, our team, relying on the efforts of all its members, moved forward relentlessly and finally defeated the Italian team 3-1, triumphantly claiming the glittering international football cup, returning it to our embrace. This marks a glorious page in the history of Shanghai sports and is truly a joyous event.</p>
<p>Offensive and Defensive Coordination</p>
<p>In this match, all the players of the Chinese team were brave and performed exceptionally well, executing both offensive and defensive plays with expertise. The coordination between the front and back lines was seamless, especially the strong and unparalleled central defense line, which was like an impregnable fortress, preventing the enemy from crossing the line. Tan Fuzhen, with his relaxed demeanor and all-around awareness, showed the poise of a Confucian general, having made significant progress since his arrival from the North, a truly capable player. (Fuzhen's playing style is pure and surpasses that of the Italian player Ottorini, and it is no exaggeration to call him the best center-back in Shanghai.) The two full-backs were also intelligent and courageous, demonstrating great stability. About ten minutes after the start of the match, an enemy forward dribbled deep into our territory, only a few yards from the goal, creating a dangerous situation. Everyone thought a goal was inevitable. Fortunately, Zhang Lingen rushed in from the side like a flying general descending from the sky, making a desperate sliding tackle, turning danger into safety. The beautiful form was breathtaking. If this shot had gone in, the opposing team would have taken the lead, drastically changing the situation, and who knows who would have emerged victorious.</p>
<p>The forwards' short passes were delicate and exquisite, indescribably wonderful. The Italian team was known for its strong central defense line, but they were helpless against this. Throughout the match, we controlled the ball for two-thirds of the time. Although the enemy was tenacious, they could not avoid defeat. The national treasure Li Yichen changed his usual style this time, playing with extraordinary effort. Relying on his natural majestic physique, he charged east and west, scoring two goals in difficult positions, establishing an immortal achievement. His second goal was incredibly sharp and heavy, hitting the crossbar perfectly. The Italian goalkeeper, McNetti, stared in disbelief, unsure what to do, truly a masterpiece of Yichen's career. (Someone joked that Yichen's goal, compared to the price of a ticket, was worth twenty-five yuan, accounting for half of it.) Sun Guishun's skillful passing and threading played an indispensable role. The forward Qian Zhineng's success and strong offensive momentum depended on Sun's support from the middle. As time was about to expire, right winger Mao Youliang received a pass from the left, dodged the enemy defense, jumped up, and headed the ball quickly like an arrow. Although McNetti caught it, it made him break out in a cold sweat, and this wonderful header was worth applauding and will remain unforgettable in our minds.</p>
<p>In short, this match was one of the most exciting of the season, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. The Chinese team's victory and fulfillment of their wishes were particularly gratifying. Hereby, we extend our blessings to the brave Chinese athletes and hope for an even better performance in the competition against the Tianjin United Team. According to reports, the Tianjin United Team is similar to the Tung Wah and South China united team. Their goalkeeper is skilled, and their offensive strategy relies on short passes and exploiting the wings, but they rarely demonstrate any creativity. However, their central defense line is very strong. It is hoped that the Shanghai Football Association can accommodate them, so as to overcome the enemy. Then it would be fortunate indeed!

<h3>Physical Education Performance at Guoqiang Elementary School - Programs Rich in Educational Significance</h3>
<p>Children are the foundation of the nation, and children's education is the work of consolidating that foundation. Children are naturally active, and giving them proper education through wholesome games makes the effect even greater.</p>
<p>Urban children lack natural environments and spend their days studying, stifling their innate vitality. In Shanghai, apart from one or two parks for children to play in, there are very few other places for recreation, and even theaters for entertainment have recently become inaccessible. Guoqiang Elementary School on Datong Road held a physical education performance the day before yesterday (the 21st) to promote children's games and relieve their boredom, inviting parents and elementary school students from the city to enter with their school badges. Upon hearing the news, our reporter went to visit.</p>
<p>At the school, the reporter, greeted by polite elementary school students, entered the crowded field, which was decorated simply and solemnly. From the loudspeaker, a crisp Mandarin voice announced that the program was about to begin.</p>
<p>The program consisted of forty-nine items, including "Relying on Each Other" and "Sign Language" and "First Aid Practice", all of which had educational significance. A few of these items are briefly described below.</p>
<p>Relying on Each Other Helps Yourself and Others</p>
<p>This involved a blind person (blindfolded) supporting a lame person, reaching their common goal by listening to the lame person's guidance. Along the way, they helped each other and lifted obstacles. This tells us that mutual assistance is humanity's duty, and that people with disabilities can also achieve success through mutual cooperation. However, on the road to success, one must always be careful to remove obstacles.</p>
<p>First Aid Practice is Exceptionally Quick</p>
<p>This is common knowledge that everyone should know. The game divides people into groups of four, one of whom is assumed to be injured. At the sound of the command, six shadows are seen flying forward like arrows. In a moment, the injured person is carried, completely bandaged, and safely reaches the destination. Their agility is such that even nurses would be amazed.</p>
<p>Strong Chain, Everyone Works Hard</p>
<p>This program is a tug-of-war, fully demonstrating collective strength, with everyone united. All the power is focused on one rope, and the emotions of the crowd in the field shrink and expand with the movement of the rope.</p>
<p>Reluctantly Leaving the Polo Match</p>
<p>Polo is an interesting and novel game. Each team has four groups, each group having four people, one of whom is a jockey, and three who act as the horse. The rules and field are similar to lacrosse. Two groups are defense, and two groups are offense, passing and competing for the ball. The play is organized and orderly, with clear advances and retreats. The excitement is the same as basketball, but with a special "wow" factor. As it was getting late, the reporter reluctantly left during the exciting polo match performance.</p>
<p>The above is a fragment of the performance that is specially introduced. It is hoped that teachers who are enthusiastic about children's education and parents who love their children will promote it more. (Skinny Reporter)</p>
<h3>Easy Fitness Training Method (7)</h3>
<p>— Written by Tom, Translated by I-De</p>
<p>Exercise Four</p>
<p>Stand upright between two desks or two chairs, or in front of a high-backed chair. Bend your body forward, placing your hands on the armrests and gripping them tightly. Step back a few steps until your toes are on the ground. Raise your head so that your entire body, from head to toe, is in a straight line. Slowly lower your body between the two desks, or two chairs, or two armrests, as low as your arms can support, and no lower.</p>
<p>To return to the original position, slowly straighten your arms and lift your body, with the center of gravity on your arms. When your arms are straightened, your body should not be bent.</p>
<p>This exercise is best for training the triceps.</p>
<p>Shoulders and Chest: Stand in front of the chair; hold the armrests with both hands; move your feet back; bend and lift your body (three times).</p>
<p>Note: To maintain the correct posture for this exercise, it is important not to be startled. Practice in groups, from three to five times; individual practice, from ten to fifteen times.</p>
<p>31. Neck Muscles</p>
<p>Special exercises for the neck muscles have been detailed previously. The exercises to make the neck joints flexible also activate the neck muscles at the same time, so it is not necessary to repeat them.</p>
<p>32. Waist, Ribs, and Back</p>
<p>Muscles of the Abdomen</p>
<p>Heart - Stomach - Liver: To keep the body's vital organs - heart, stomach, and liver, especially the stomach - in the correct position to maintain health, special attention must be paid to the muscles around each organ.</p>
