<p>社評</p>
<h3>論上海市財政問題</h3>
<p>財政為庶政之母，欲求提高行政效率，必先整理財政使之健全。整理財政之道，以開源與節流，為積極與消極之兩大原則。旦並本市財政，入不敷出，欲求行政效率之提高，整理財政，自屬急不容緩。</p>
<p>本市三十三年度總概算，除第一區外經常歲入編列為二六〇，九九〇，三七四·七〇元。共中以田賦收入為首位，佔百分之四〇·七，而以南市賭塲特賦為第二位，佔總收入百分之一五·六。再次為袖助款收入，佔百分之一四。此三項收入，已佔總數百分乏七十。由此觀之，除第一項田賦為正常收入外，其第二第三兩項均不能認為正常收入。况南市賭塲業已取締停閉，則此項收入更不能列入。如以人為比衡，如共人之生活費，須以不正當收入及他人補助以維持，則共生活之危險可知，個人如此，政府機關何獨不然。</p>
<p>就開源而言，積極方面自以增加稅率爲主要途徑，但增稅爲增加市民負擔，增加市民負擔，必須與增加市民利益成為正比例，自應鄭重決定。以田賦而言，據財政局三十一年度「財務行取」所列本市現微田額，平均毎畝田賦為二四·三九元，但農民對田賦之負擔，事實決不止每畝二十四元餘之數。一其次，本市捐稅專稅收入，尙不及賭塲特賦之多，實使人難以置信·如公用事業及中央市塲營業範圍均不為小，而每月收人平均祇有一七五，三八一元，尙不及一普通商店，亦　不無疑義者。因此，整理市財政，開源之外，與開源具有密切關係之調整機構與制度尤為重要。如不先加調整而言開源，則所開之源，難保不流入於私，結果於公並無裨補。至於調整之道，就管見所及，申述如次</p>
<p>廢除包稅制度，整理稅收。包稅制度之產生，原為財務機構組織未臻完備，而稅　　　　　，因是招人承包，實為權宜之計。但本市財政機構組織不能調爲未臻完備，並無必須採用包稅制度之原因存在，則各項稅收自應由財政機關直接統收。况且，歷來對於包稅制度之弊　重重，承包權之取得，莫不賴於　緣。不論承包人之或盈或虧，均不合理，更遑論承包之數，毎差於實收數遠甚，實為市庫財政收入一大損失。過去第一區公署，承襲前工部局稅收直接統收統付辦法，較有成績。希望整個市財政中之稅收，從速廢除包稅制度。</p>
<p>賦稅統收，加强稅收機構職權，市財政局在各特區均設又賦稅管理處，辦理徵收賦稅，但烟酒竹木豬隻等稅，均各另立專稅徵收處，在同一市區下。多立稅收機構，不但增加經費開支，如管理上稍不健全，則等於多有幾個漏洞。各特區旣已設置賦稅管理處，則各項稅收，自應由該處統一辦理，以一職權，而專責成，希望市財政當局從速裁併駢枝機關統一職權。</p>
<p>實施廢除包稅制度，整理稅收以後，則收入可以增加；實施裁併駢枝機關，减少冗員以後，則支出可以减少。對於整個市財政，可期活潑健全，然後對於公務人員，保安隊與警察的待遇，敎育經費，充分增加，使每個服務公職人員均能維持最低限度的生活以後，才能切實談到提高行政效率。這是本末輕重，緩急先後的判別大道。</p>
<h3>巴列爾附近殘敵　遭日軍南北夾擊　怒江西岸日軍獲重大戰果</h3>
<p>仰光二十三日中央社電　巴列爾附近敵二十師新得萬　方面第三十二旅之增援，又稍行振作，刻正作執拗抵抗·該市自開始作戰以來，經日印盟軍連日猛攻，損失甚鉅。於達姆莫列附近，受日軍南北夾攻，喪失一旅、殘餘之兩旅則於基　及下克諾巴爾以及巴列爾附近，先後遭受日軍猛攻，蒙大打擊。總計該市傷亡人數達八千餘人，幾潰不成軍。</p>
<p>仰光二十三日中央社電　巴列爾公路以南之殘敵，由於日軍之砲擊及肉搏、已逐次筱圍，本月十一日拂曉日軍突入五一八五高地東方高地之一角後，即對該處敵軍據點作壯烈之攻擊，卒於十九日上午四時將之佔領，予敵軍中央據點之先拿姆以直接威脅，並確保有利地點。其後敵軍為謀奪回該高地，曾逆　數次，但經日軍仰頭痛攻，終吿潰退。</p>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據康提來電稱：東南亞洲反軸心軍司令部曾發表戰况：反軸心軍部隊企圖自西北方包圍比先波爾，現在正與日軍激戰中。</p>
<p>廣州二十三日中央社電　淪方爲謀掩飾其迭次敗戰，近曾積極宜傳其　南遠征軍進擊怒江西岸地區之成功，但事實恰與此相反。荒怒江西岸地區之渝軍，刻正到處遭受日軍精銳部隊之痛擊，而呈殲滅之勢。緣日軍精銳部隊已控制由馬鞍山至六庫之戰綫，另一部隊更確保由跑馬山至紅　樹之陣。又另一部隊更呼應上項日軍擊滅進抵怒江西岸地區之淪軍。自上月下旬以來，至本月十九日止，日軍已予淪軍以深刻之打擊，計渝軍屍體經確認者達七百四十四具。</p>
<h3>日中村大將評述　太平洋戰局</h3>
<p>東京廿三日中央社電　日中村海軍大將，頃於此間五月號太平洋雜誌，評論中部太平洋戰局，謂該方而作戰無急速進展之理。茲誌其要旨如次；現階段中部太平洋作戰，美國之主要目的實如尼米　所云，在　打開新幾內　　　　　　　　　　　之關口，開闢一條經菲律賓直通中國之血路，切斷大東亞共榮國，隔絕日本與南方資源地之聯絡，故新幾內亞方面之作戰，與中部太平洋之作戰，實基於一理。於此吾人當認淸與南洋羣島之地理狀况，及各島之距離，認識此點則可知所謂美海軍佔得吉爾貝特羣島馬紹爾羣島之一部，便可長驅攻擊加羅林羣島瑪利亞納羣島之說全屬無稽。美海軍攻擊馬紹爾羣島之庫埃茲林島羅特島時，即動員艦船二百萬噸，故欲攻擊加羅林·瑪利服納，則非再增加數倍不可。當敵軍於庫埃茲林島登陸之後，歷十七日即有敵軍機動部隊攻擊　此相隔九百五十海里之特　克島，然此乃艦隊之行動之本質，雖出沒飄忽，不足驚異，成問題者，仍在基地之是否在飛機有效轟炸圈內。按登陸作戰之前提條件，為把握登陸地點附近之制空權，且須亦攻擊目的地側面二三百海里內取得基地，如僅以機動部隊來襲擊，或奪取日軍之空軍基地，殊無成功之望。美軍絕不暴露其撥動部隊於制空權不穩之地，採用使其飽受威脅之登陸作戰方法，美軍荒正在嘗試「拋桯漸進主義」，採取一氣呵成王義，而力謀突破日軍南方第一防禦綫。就敵軍迄今作戰之方式而觀，僅能運用平凡之數理，殊未能發揮統帥天才之妙用。但此種數理，即已敎導敵艦隊使其不進入日軍之制空　內，故敵掌此次作戰之根本理念，予吾一個感想，即中部太平洋作戰無迅進發展之理</p>
<h3>浙江大學停辦　政院已照准　郵件加價案亦經通過</h3>
<p>南京二十三日中央社電　行政院二十三日舉行二一〇次例會，通過要案摘錄如左：報告事項，　院長報吿，據敎育部呈，為　將國立浙江大學停辦，請鑒核等情到院，核尙可行，已指復照准，除通知財政部暨浙江省政府外，並呈報中央政治委員會備案。討論事項，　院長交議，據內政部梅部長呈，為　具取締土　行商章程補充辦法草案，請鑒核等情，請公决案，决議通過，由該部公布施行。　院長交議，據建設部陳兼部長呈，據郵政總局駐滬辦事處呈，請增加國內航空郵資附加費百分之二百，轉請鑒核等情，請公决案，决議通過。　院畏交議，據建設部陳兼部長呈，據郵政總局駐滬辦事處呈，請改訂各項國內　兌手續費，經核應比照現行國內郵資附加費　加辦法擬予增加百分之二百，以示平允，檢同附表轉　　核等情，請公决案，决議通過。　院長交議，據建設部陳兼部長呈，據郵政總局　滬辦事處呈，請稺訂　際郵件　　，經核　此　現行國內郵件資費增加率，擴予增加百分之二百，檢同修正國際各類郵件資費表，轉請鑒核等情，請公决案，决議通過。　院長交　，據首都警察總監署李總監呈送置辦長　夾　制服臨時支出槪算一案，經先　據本院秘書處招集財政部及首都警察總監署會同審查，簽　意見，請公决案，决議照審查意見通過。</p>
<h3>小倉氏在津　發表談話</h3>
<p>天津二十三日中央社電　國府最高經濟顧問小倉正恒，二十一日夜由平抵津，二十二日分訪各關係方面，復出席天津日本經濟所主辦之歡仰懇談會，當時曾與日方產業經濟界代表多人，作種種懇談，並於該所接見記者，發表談話，大意謂：「當前之一切重大問題，均當以戰爭勝利為先決條件，若戰爭失敗，則日本固減亡，而中國亦無從倖免。故吾人為爭取戰爭勝利，必須增强戰力，為增强戰力，必須安定民生，而本年度華北米　，收獲情形尙佳，此在安定民生上，實大有助力。華北素稱農菜地帶，為使其充分發展，自應從根本上貫澈治水工作及從事造林。其次關於解決物價問題，刻正謀收回通貨，以資調整，但在收回通貨以前，首應防止囤積，現在多量之游　，除用以囤積物品以外，別無他用，此實為一問題，故今後當局對此，自應作根本之解決。」</p>
<h3>陳院長蒞黨訓團　代主席訓話</h3>
<p>南京二十三日中央社電　立法院陳院長二十三日下午二時半親臨黨務工作人員訓練團，代表主席訓話，講述「關於本鐵的檢討」。追述還都以來，政治軍事各方面都未有長足之進展，皆由於本黨本身未能盡領導之作用，並例舉德國納粹黨　監苦之歴程，最後勉勵全體學員，要以最大決心與勇氣，來硏究如何改造本黨，充實本黨力量，完成本黨歷史使命。</p>
<h3>淮海省法幣　交換將竣事　期滿即禁使用聯銀券</h3>
<p>南京二十三日中央社電　淮海省之通貨制度，自經財政當局　次調整以來，頗著成效，其於國府調節金融，暢通物資以等大業上，裨益尤宏，現該省區內中儲券與聯銀券之交換限期，在徐州市，海州，宿縣，運雲港等四　事都市。定於本月底截止，至其他各縣區，則限於本年九月底截止，開始以米，每日交換情形頗為踴躍，故據有關方面統計，交換數字，已將至完了程度，故屆至當局所定之限期，定能如期換竣。因此，財政當局為禁止於交換期限截止以後，徜仍有使用聯銀券情事，特制定禁止辦法，深盼該省區內全體人民，仰體政府當局統一幣制，穩定金融之實施，予以全面協力，如有尙未交換者，務望從速掉換，期滿之後，切勿玩忽法令，擅再使用，致蹈妨害幣制，擾亂金融之罪嫌。財政部周部長，昨特為此發表重要談話，關明政府之意旨，茲將周財長談話及該項禁止辦法錄后：</p>

<h3>日本强力推行　戰時外交　外務省添聘顧問</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日重光外相爲集思廣益，謀强力推行戰時外交，前曾騁請前外相有　八郎·貴族院議員山川均兩氏為外交顧問。茲鑒於現國際情勢下，檢討國際財政金融政策，　嚴重要，乃特聘內閣顧問，前日銀總裁結城豐太郎為外務省之最高顧問、協贊辦理外務省事務。</p>

<p>張部長赴津</p>
<p>北平二十三日中央社電　國府司法行政部長張一　氏，為視察華北司法來平，現已公畢，昨赴天津各地視察。</p>
<h3>蘇州破獲　販土機關</h3>
<p>蘇州特訊　據聞蘇州無錫一帶，有著名私土販設有大規模之販土機關。共中以郭某為主要人，自經政府公布三年禁絕之法令後，一般私土飯雖稍稍斂跡，而最近蘇州城內私版機關竟將大批私土運往鄕區，冀圖脫售，第一批二千餘兩業已運走，第二批又一千餘兩疋裝載汽車，由郭某押運，行至平門橋堍，被當地新成立之禁烟局緝私員瞥見，認為行跡可疑，上前檢查，當場人　緝獲，局方以案情重大，電部請示云云。</p>
<h3>應付西歐大戰　德具有把握　現擁有大量裝甲部隊</h3>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　海通社訊：柏林金融報戰稱，西歐沿岸之德軍砲轟陣綫，除　堡及深溝高壘之堅强據點外，尙有其他防務設備，在被動之防綫外，尙有最重要之主動攻擊武器，即　　師團是也。西綫之主要防禦，乃如往昔之以積　進攻為主，此點乃毫無疑義者。流動之裝甲部隊已準備就緒，以作反攻或集中火力向被敵人突破之點掃射。敵方登陸企圖佔有主動之利，因敵人處於可遺　進攻地點之地位，並以　人大軍向該點　中，防軍則須儘速調兵保持均勢，因此大隊裝甲部隊大砲等均須隨時　候調遺。裝甲車之主要任務，為擊退空迎軍或傘兵之司能威脅，故德裝甲軍係分駐於法國腹地，以訪敵　向空中降落，一至於其他　備迎擊反軸心空運軍之秘密措施，自然不能透露。反軸心軍雖在人數方面佔優勢，但在登陸之後，殆難與等量之德裝甲軍匹敵，因最大之運輸機亦僅能運載輕砲及輕坦克車也。為防天空攻擊德之裝甲軍，與東綫完全不同，法國之地一形及交通網之密佈，足供秘密掩蔽行軍，槪括言之，在西歐之總裝甲軍已準備就緒，以阻敵人之企圖，後備之裝甲軍數目，遠比一九四〇年在法國所用者爲多，英美軍在法登陸之時所遭遇戰爭機構，將遠比在西西里及美國所　者勢力雄厚。</p>
<p>移轉目光戰略窺破</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　海通社軍事特派員奧爾培稱：蘇聯方面雖已宣布與侵歐有關之大戰　已　合，英國方面亦　次聲明西歐攻勢之準備業已完畢，然在事實上反軸心軍似尙無在各綫間時開始進攻之徵象。　蘇軍之南路戰綫尙在轟斯特河之東，故自該區總攻歐洲之推　，未免失之過早。過去數日來蘇軍猛攻格利哥里奧波爾與勃陀區之橋頭陣地，證實紅軍重視該地，以為　　進攻之出發點。德空軍大隊猛炸集中於科西嘉之軍隊，反軸心軍在該處　中大軍，與　中於英南部之三百五十萬軍　　　　　，以　　　　地區與法　南海岸，而牽掣西歟之德軍。惟此項移轉目光之戰略，早在德軍司令部明　之中，必將粉碎其計劃，德軍司令部　有足够之軍力，對戰事之結果具有充分之把握。</p>
<p>羅斯福將攻歐期近</p>
<p>里斯本廿三日中央社電　海通社訊，華盛頓息：羅斯福總統昨以租軍法案第十五次報吿書提交　會時，表示攻歐即將開始。渠稱，聯合國家現將自東西南三方面之根據地進攻歐洲。</p>
<p>英王喬治檢閱三軍</p>
<p>瑞典京城廿三日中央社電　海通社訊，據倫敦消息：反軸心侵歐部隊英軍總司令蒙高茂萊將軍，曾向英王喬治六世解　侵歐計劃之最後細則。今晨英京方面宣布，英皇檢閱蒙氏所統率之部隊，此項部隊現　於英倫某地，將由艾森　華將軍統率參加攻歐。英王於上星期並曾檢閱國內艦隊及英空軍。</p>
<p>德軍將領會商防務</p>
<p>維希二十三日中央社電　據維希無綫　播稱，西歐德軍總司令倫台特元帥曾與渠　下之　　爾元帥會脅防務。</p>
<p>倫敦火車突然停駛</p>
<p>瑞典京城三日央社電　海通社訊：倫敦消息，昨在倫敦各車站候車之市民數千，忽聞火車多列停駛，頗為　　。官方對於在多數重要幹綫突然停阻火車開駛之事，並未發表說明文吿，且鐵路當局曾暗示平民旅行可能全被禁止。</p>

<h3>商統會改組問題　機構將調整　米統會採購米糧調整價格</h3>
<p>關於全國商業統制總會之改組，及米糧統制委員會米糧採配機稱之改　，實業部陳部長特於日前來滬與有關各當局商榷，並召見商統會唐理事長　民，及米統會袁主任委員覆登，詳詢過去實際情形及檢討缺點，以謀今後圓滑營運。現陳部長在瀝任務完畢，業已返京覆命，請示行政院確定調整方策。據中央社記者探悉，商統會全體理監事及米統會全體委員辭職，當局一致挽留連任。至於商統會改組間題，大致將調整內部機構，並強化商統會下部外團各業部門，獨立統制制度，使物資統制簡捷化，以期完密各業物資統一統制步驟，商統會則繁劃指導統制工作。米統會採員米糧將視各地實際情形，決定適合農情之收買價格，以期增強收買數量，並改　配給制度，聞此事頃經行政院通過公布實施。</p>

<p>日本盟邦　海軍紀念節特輯</p>
<h3>日本海海戰</h3>
<p>— 武藤貞</p>
<p>當時的聯合艦隊司令長官東鄉大將的胸中，滿懷憂悶，這不為了別的。在黃海海戰中，雖捉住了敵人，但不能殲滅之，被其逃入旅順港內。明治三十七年八月的黃海海戰，當然，挫滅了敵艦隊逃出旅順的企圖，受了相當損傷，打了一次勝仗，但那不是全勝。</p>
<p>爲什麼不能完成全勝呢？當時的聯合艦隊並沒有捨身以赴。誠然，波羅的海艦隊在向東航行的途上。爲等待這第二個敵人，在擊減第一個敵人（遠東艦隊）時，不能不極力遊免負傷。旅順對鎖中，柬鄉長官不育大舉出動主力艦。假使外國記者也批評黃海海戰前的東鄉元帥過於謹愼而缺乏決斷，那或許是妄斷。然一旦　殲了旅順的敵人，身心俱經，而邀擊第二個敵人波羅的海艦隊時，東鄉平八郎的大智若愚方才突然在這裏發揮出來了。</p>
<p>元帥的凜然勇氣，在未戰之先，已有氣吞敵人之概。秋山中佐起草報告大本營的第一報，第一句是：「接得發見敵艦之警報」，第二句是「擬立即出動邀擊之」。東鄉元帥見後，立刻用鉛筆把「邀擊」的邀字刪去，添加「擊滅」的減字。</p>
<p>明治三十八年五月二十七日上午三時三十分的束鄉長官，除莞爾微笑以外，毫無別的表情。赴湯蹈火在所不　。現在祗一心粉身碎骨擊滅敵人。這裹，首先向全艦隊發出命令：「棄擲燃料」。爲　備萬一敵艦隊轉向太平洋逃去，乃破釜沉舟，使艦身輕速，作孤注一擲的大決戰。</p>
<p>快到與敵對陣的待刻了，西風頗狂。要使射擊準確，先須獲得艦位與風位的條件。於是命令旗艦三笠號以下全部艦隊在敵前掉頭。鄉價是冒臉，敵人出於意外，不知道日軍有何神秘的戰術，心驚　碎，於是失掉了獲勝的最重要時機。「擊減」這時候已經成功了。</p>
<p>我們外行看來，在時機迫切萬分的時候，何必用「天氣晴朗，但波浪頗高」的美麗的形容字眼。但祗此一句，大本　單就預備高奏凱歌了。假使天氣晴朗，那就是使聯合艦隊沒有比敵更討厭的「濃霧艦隊」的證據。波浪頗高」，日本艦隊在平常操演的時候已經司空見慣，然而在外國海軍則是難得遇到而近來始經歷的苦境。幸而「波浪頗窩」，乃成為日本海軍的絕好條件，而敵八視之則為致命傷，這大約是神明的庇護吧！驚　駭浪，提起了氣吞山嶽的意氣。而敵人則鱉慌失措，大砲也放不出了</p>
<p>「天氣晴朗，但波浪頗高」，東鄉大將在發出這一句的電文時，就已預定下勝利的記錄了。（翔譯自讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>盡本分</h3>
<p>盡本分爲人間最要之事，而先看本分爲何，尤屬重要。</p>

<p>凡人必有長處。茍作如是想，必能爲用。如爲不忘忠實者，決不可棄。</p>
<h3>細心</h3>

<h3>知愧</h3>
<p>所謂知愧者，乃一可大可小而意味深長之語也，此爲昔日武士所心銘不忘。即大而言之，當國家為正羲而處於艱難之際，萬一失敗，即爲國家之恥辱。小而言之，則於誠之一道莫落人後。</p>
<h3>戒巧言令色</h3>

<p>才子無誠心</p>
<p>才子動　恃才傲物，缺乏誠心，故一時雖能欺瞞他人，但欲使之心服，則不可能也。</p>
<h3>信</h3>
<p>信最重要，古人置之於五常之末，想有深意。無論忠孝，如不以此貫之，終難見信於人。</p>
<h3>名文與見識</h3>
<p>欲　近乎事實眞相之物，必具見識。苟無之，縱成名文，亦不足讀焉。</p>
<h3>人之心境變化</h3>
<p>人之心理狀態頗為奇妙，於某種塲合，雖生死亦不成問題。然此毋甯於負責不重之時為甚。</p>
<h3>忍從為婦人之美德</h3>
<p>世間事未能盡如所思行之，故忍耐殊爲必要。而家庭間尤多無理可喻之事，苟喻事事合理，必生破綻，故非有忍耐第一之覺悟不可。如今女權漸張，所謂忍耐云云，或有時代落伍之嫌亦未可知，然一旦身爲人妻，而與家庭有直接關係時，則獨身時縱爲妄自逞強者，亦當切實深思焉。</p>
<p>所謂忍耐，多發諸眞心，故如切念公婆及良人，自能增強忍耐心。</p>
<h3>女子應愼於剛愎</h3>
<p>女子若剛愎自用，最堪慨嘆！</p>
<p>愼戒剛愎則佳。守正這而行是也。如謹守父母師長之教，則桂矣。惜哉今日之多過於任性也！</p>
<h3>放任主義行不得</h3>
<p>世間如果善良，則放任之亦無妨，或反可由此習知善事，惟殊不能行之於今日。子女之教育，爲母者最須注意。蓋爲父者縱然關懷，因常在外，故非由母親充分教育兒童不司。子女之事，實爲母親最重要之大事。（未完待續）</p>

        <h1>1944 - n141</h1>
<h3>On Shanghai's Financial Problems</h3>
<p>Finance is the mother of all governance. To improve administrative efficiency, it is imperative to first rectify finances and make them sound. The way to rectify finances lies in two major principles: increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, representing both active and passive approaches. However, the city of Shanghai's finances are currently operating at a deficit. Therefore, seeking to improve administrative efficiency and rectify finances is a matter of utmost urgency.</p>
<p>The city's general budget for the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), excluding the first district, projects a recurring revenue of 260,990,374.70 yuan. Among these, land tax revenue ranks first, accounting for 40.7%, while special tax revenue from the Nanshi gambling houses ranks second, accounting for 15.6% of the total revenue. Next comes subsidy revenue, accounting for 14%. These three items already account for 70% of the total amount. From this, it can be seen that, apart from land tax, which is a normal source of revenue, the second and third items cannot be considered normal sources. Moreover, with the Nanshi gambling houses already banned and closed, this revenue can no longer be included. If we use a human analogy, if a person's living expenses must be maintained by improper income and subsidies from others, then the danger of that person's life is evident. The same holds true for government agencies.</p>
<p>In terms of increasing revenue, actively increasing tax rates is the main approach. However, increasing taxes increases the burden on citizens, and increasing the burden on citizens must be directly proportional to increasing the benefits to citizens, so it should be decided with great caution. Regarding land tax, according to the Finance Bureau's 31st year (1942) "Financial Practices," the current land tax levied in the city averages 24.39 yuan per mu (unit of area). However, the actual burden of land tax on farmers is definitely more than 24 yuan per mu. Secondly, it is hard to believe that the income from the city's donations, taxes, and special taxes is less than that from the special tax on gambling houses. Public utilities and central market operating scales are not small, but monthly revenue averages only 175,381 yuan, even less than a common store, which is also doubtful. Therefore, to rectify city finances, in addition to increasing revenue, adjusting institutions and systems, which is closely related to increasing revenue, is particularly important. If we talk about increasing revenue without first making adjustments, it is difficult to ensure that the increased revenue does not flow into private hands, and the result will not benefit the public. As for the way to adjust, as far as I can see, I will state it as follows:</p>
<p>Abolish the tax farming system and rectify tax collection. The tax farming system was originally created because the organization of financial institutions was not yet complete, and tax collection was difficult. Therefore, people were contracted to collect taxes, which was a temporary measure. However, since the organizational structure of the city's financial institutions is not yet perfect, and there is no reason why the tax farming system must be adopted, all tax revenue should be directly collected by the financial authorities. Moreover, there have always been many abuses of the tax farming system. Obtaining the right to contract is always dependent on connections. Whether the contractor makes a profit or a loss is unreasonable, not to mention that the amount contracted is often far less than the actual amount collected, which is a major loss to the city's treasury revenue. In the past, the First District Public Office inherited the former Public Works Bureau's method of directly collecting and paying taxes, which was relatively successful. It is hoped that the tax revenue of the entire city's finances will abolish the tax farming system as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Unify tax collection and strengthen the powers of tax collection agencies. The Municipal Finance Bureau has established tax management offices in each special zone to handle the collection of taxes. However, taxes on tobacco, alcohol, bamboo, wood, and pigs are all collected by separate special tax collection offices in the same urban area. Establishing multiple tax collection agencies not only increases expenditure, but if the management is not sound, it is equivalent to having several more loopholes. Since tax management offices have already been established in each special zone, all tax revenue should be handled by the office in a unified manner, with one authority and dedicated responsibility. It is hoped that the municipal finance authorities will promptly abolish redundant agencies and unify powers.</p>
<p>After implementing the abolition of the tax farming system and rectifying tax collection, revenue can be increased; after implementing the consolidation of redundant agencies and reducing redundant personnel, expenditure can be reduced. For the entire city's finances, it can be expected to be vigorous and sound. Then, for civil servants, security teams, and police treatment, and education funding, a sufficient increase can be made, so that every civil servant can maintain a minimum standard of living before we can realistically talk about improving administrative efficiency. This is the grand principle of distinguishing between the fundamental and the superficial, the urgent and the secondary.</p>
<h3>Remnants of the Enemy Near Barel Attacked by Japanese Forces from North and South, Japanese Forces on the West Bank of the Nujiang River Achieve Major Victory</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Yangon, 23rd - The enemy's 20th Division near Barel has been somewhat reinvigorated by reinforcements from the 32nd Brigade in the Xinde Wan area and is currently putting up stubborn resistance. Since the start of the battle, the city has suffered heavy losses due to continuous fierce attacks by the Japanese-Indian Allied forces. Near Dammo Le, they were attacked by Japanese forces from the north and south, losing one brigade. The remaining two brigades were subjected to fierce attacks by Japanese forces near Jiji and Xiakenobaer, as well as near Barel, suffering heavy blows. In total, the city has suffered more than 8,000 casualties, and it has almost collapsed.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Yangon, 23rd - The remnants of the enemy south of the Barel Highway have been gradually surrounded by Japanese artillery fire and close combat. At dawn on the 11th of this month, Japanese forces broke into a corner of the eastern heights of Highland 5185 and launched a heroic attack on the enemy stronghold there. They finally occupied it at 4 a.m. on the 19th, posing a direct threat to the enemy's central stronghold, Xiannamu, and securing a favorable location. Subsequently, the enemy launched several counterattacks in an attempt to regain the highland, but after a fierce attack by the Japanese army, they finally collapsed and retreated.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 23rd - According to a report from Kandy, the Southeast Asian Anti-Axis Forces Command has announced the battle situation: Anti-Axis forces are attempting to encircle Bixian Bor from the northwest and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese forces.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 23rd - In order to conceal its repeated defeats, the enemy has recently actively promoted the success of its Southern Expeditionary Force's attack on the west bank of the Nujiang River, but the facts are just the opposite. The Chongqing army in the wilderness on the west bank of the Nujiang River is currently being severely attacked everywhere by the elite units of the Japanese army and is showing a tendency to be annihilated. The elite units of the Japanese army have controlled the battle line from Maanshan to Liuku, and another unit has secured the position from Paomashan to Hongshuteng. Another unit is responding to the above-mentioned Japanese army to annihilate the enemy army that has advanced to the west bank of the Nujiang River. Since the end of last month to the 19th of this month, the Japanese army has inflicted a profound blow on the enemy army, and the bodies of the Chongqing army that have been confirmed have reached 744.</p>
<h3>General Nakamura Comments on the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - Japanese Navy General Nakamura recently commented on the war situation in the Central Pacific in the May issue of the Pacific Magazine, saying that there is no reason for the rapid progress of the war on that side. The main points are as follows: At this stage of the Central Pacific War, the main purpose of the United States is, as Nimi said, to open the gateway to New Guinea, open a blood path directly to China via the Philippines, cut off the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and isolate Japan from the resource areas in the South. Therefore, the war in New Guinea and the war in the Central Pacific are based on the same principle. Here, we should clearly understand the geographical situation of the South Sea Islands and the distance between the islands. If we recognize this point, we can know that the so-called US Navy's capture of part of the Gilbert Islands and the Marshall Islands can lead to a long-term attack on the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands is entirely nonsense. When the US Navy attacked Kuezelin Island and Roth Island in the Marshall Islands, it mobilized 2 million tons of ships. Therefore, to attack Caroline and Mariana, it must be increased several times. After the enemy forces landed on Kuezelin Island, enemy mobile units attacked Tuck Island, which is 950 nautical miles away, after only 17 days. However, this is the essence of the fleet's actions. Although it appears and disappears unpredictably, it is not surprising. The problem is still whether the base is within the effective bombing range of the aircraft. According to the premise of landing operations, it is necessary to grasp the air control near the landing site and also obtain a base within 200 to 300 nautical miles of the side of the target. If only mobile units are used to attack or seize the Japanese air force base, there is no hope of success. The US military will never expose its mobile units in a place where air control is unstable and adopt a landing operation method that makes them vulnerable to threats. The US military is currently trying "gradual progress" and adopting an all-in-one approach to break through the Japanese army's southern first line of defense. Judging from the enemy's operations so far, it can only use ordinary mathematics and has not been able to exert the wonderful use of the commander's genius. However, this kind of mathematics has already taught the enemy fleet not to enter the Japanese air control area. Therefore, the enemy's fundamental concept of this operation gives me the impression that there is no reason for the rapid development of the Central Pacific War.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang University to Be Closed, Approved by the Executive Yuan, Postage Increase Also Passed</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd - The Executive Yuan held its 210th regular meeting on the 23rd and passed the following important cases: Report matters, the President of the Yuan reported that the Ministry of Education presented that the National Zhejiang University will be closed, and asked for review.

Submitted by the President of the Yuan, Minister of Construction Chen presented a request from the Shanghai Office of the Postal Administration to increase the domestic airmail surcharge by 200%, requesting review. The resolution was passed. Submitted by the President of the Yuan, Minister of Construction Chen presented a request from the Shanghai Office of the Postal Administration to revise the handling fees for various domestic remittances. After review, it should be increased by 200% in accordance with the current domestic postage surcharge increase method to show fairness. A table is attached for review. The resolution was passed. Submitted by the President of the Yuan, Minister of Construction Chen presented a request from the Shanghai Office of the Postal Administration to revise the international postal rates. After review, the current domestic postage increase rate is extended to increase by 200%. A revised table of international postal rates for various types of mail is attached for review. The resolution was passed. Submitted by the President of the Yuan, Chief Inspector of the Capital Police Department Li presented a case for the temporary expenditure budget for the purchase of long coats and uniforms. After the Secretariat of the Yuan convened the Ministry of Finance and the Capital Police Department for review, and signed opinions, the decision was passed in accordance with the review opinions.</p>
<h3>Mr. Ogura Gives a Speech in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd - Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the highest economic advisor to the National Government, arrived in Tianjin from Peiping on the night of the 21st. On the 22nd, he visited various related parties and attended a cordial talk meeting hosted by the Tianjin Japan Economic Research Institute. At that time, he had various cordial talks with many representatives from the Japanese industrial and economic circles and met with reporters at the institute to give a speech. The general idea was: "All major issues at present should take the victory of the war as a prerequisite. If the war fails, Japan will perish, and China will not be spared. Therefore, in order to strive for victory in the war, we must strengthen our combat power. In order to strengthen our combat power, we must stabilize people's livelihoods. The harvest of rice in North China this year is still good, which is of great help in stabilizing people's livelihoods. North China has always been known as an agricultural and vegetable area. In order to fully develop it, we should fundamentally implement water management and engage in afforestation. Secondly, regarding the solution to the price problem, we are currently planning to recover currency for adjustment. However, before recovering currency, we should first prevent hoarding. A large amount of roaming funds are used for hoarding goods, which is a problem. Therefore, the authorities should fundamentally solve this in the future."</p>
<h3>President Chen Visits the Party Training Corps and Gives a Speech on Behalf of the Chairman</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd - President Chen of the Legislative Yuan personally visited the Party Affairs Workers Training Corps at 2:30 p.m. on the 23rd and gave a speech on behalf of the chairman, discussing "Regarding the Review of the Party." He recalled that since the return to the capital, there has been no significant progress in political and military affairs, all because the party itself has failed to fully play its leading role. He cited the painful experiences of the German Nazi Party and finally encouraged all the trainees to use the greatest determination and courage to study how to transform the party, enrich the party's strength, and complete the party's historical mission.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Legal Tender in Huaihai Province About to Be Completed, Use of United Reserve Bank Notes Prohibited After the Deadline</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd - The currency system in Huaihai Province has been quite effective since it was adjusted several times by the financial authorities. It is especially helpful to the great cause of the National Government in regulating finance and smoothing material circulation. The deadline for the exchange of Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes in the province is the end of this month in the four major cities of Xuzhou, Haizhou, Suxian, and Lianyungang. For other counties and districts, the deadline is the end of September this year. The exchange has been very enthusiastic since it started with rice every day. Therefore, according to statistics from relevant parties, the exchange figures are about to be completed. Therefore, it is certain that the exchange will be completed as scheduled by the deadline set by the authorities. Therefore, in order to prohibit the use of United Reserve Bank notes after the expiration of the exchange period, the financial authorities have specially formulated prohibition methods. It is hoped that all the people in the province will support the government authorities' implementation of a unified currency system and stabilize finance, and give full cooperation. If there are still those who have not exchanged, it is hoped that they will exchange them as soon as possible. After the deadline, do not neglect the laws and regulations and use them again without authorization, so as not to commit the crime of hindering the currency system and disrupting finance. Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance gave an important speech on this matter yesterday to clarify the government's intentions. The speech of Minister Zhou and the prohibition measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>Minister Zhou's Speech</p>
<p>Regarding the adjustment of the currency system in Huaihai Province, the government has gradually implemented it and has gradually achieved results. All Central Reserve Bank notes and China United Reserve Bank notes in the province will be fully exchanged. The deadline is extended to May 31 this year in the four cities of Xuzhou, Haizhou, Suxian, and Lianyungang. Other areas in Huaihai Province are extended to September 30 this year. When the period expires, their use will be prohibited separately. I have already issued a statement before, and now I have specially formulated the Measures for Prohibiting the Use of United Reserve Bank Notes in Huaihai Province to facilitate implementation. According to these measures, after the expiration of the above-mentioned full exchange period, the use of China United Reserve Bank notes in all regions of the province should be prohibited. If there is any violation, in addition to confiscating the United Reserve Bank notes and turning them over to the public, they will be punished according to the severity of the circumstances in accordance with the law. The term "use of United Reserve Bank notes" refers to the use of the notes as currency. For the sake of clarity, the following usage behaviors are listed again: (1) Purchase and sale of goods, (2) Payment of expenses, (3) Clearing of debts, (4) Exchange of currencies, (5) Use of deposits and collateral, (6) Use of loans and gifts. Anyone who uses United Reserve Bank notes for the above behaviors, regardless of whether they receive or give, will be punished in accordance with the law.

<h3>Wartime National Banquet Restriction Guidelines</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Beijing - In order to emphasize the importance of frugality during wartime, the Ministry of Social Welfare has recently drafted the Wartime National Banquet Restriction Guidelines. It was passed by the 209th Executive Yuan meeting and the 47th Supreme National Defense Conference on the 20th. The full text contains 22 articles, which are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: These guidelines are specially formulated to adapt to the wartime system, practice thrift, and prepare materials to enhance national strength.</p>

<p>Article 5: The wartime banquet is based on 10 people per table, and each table includes various flavors of hot and cold dishes, soup, and dessert, and should not exceed eight dishes.

<h3>Japan Vigorously Promotes Wartime Diplomacy, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hires Additional Advisors</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - In order to gather ideas and vigorously promote wartime diplomacy, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu previously hired former Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro and Mountain River, a member of the House of Peers, as diplomatic advisors. In view of the current international situation, it is particularly important to review international financial policies. Therefore, Yuichi Kasai, Cabinet Advisor, and former Governor of the Bank of Japan, has been specially hired as the highest advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assist in handling the affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously hired Arita and Yamakawa as consultants. On the 23rd, it appointed Honda Kumata Ryou, a veteran diplomat and former ambassador to China, as a consultant to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>Japan's Imperial Rule Assistance Association Refreshes Its Structure</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - Since its establishment, the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association has been reorganized several times. Now, in order to respond to the decisive battle situation, it will take the opportunity of the fifth membership re-election to refresh its structure. The motion has been officially passed by the routine general affairs meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd. This reorganization will not only establish a responsibility system for handling association affairs, but also increase the association's activity.</p>
<p>Minister Zhang Goes to Tianjin</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Peiping, 23rd - Zhang Yi, Minister of Justice Administration of the National Government, came to Peiping to inspect the judiciary in North China. He has now completed his official duties and went to Tianjin and other places to inspect yesterday.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Cracks Down on Opium Trafficking Agency</h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from Suzhou - It is reported that in the Suzhou-Wuxi area, a well-known private opium trafficker has established a large-scale opium trafficking agency. Guo is the main person. Since the government announced the three-year ban, most private opium traffickers have slightly converged, but recently a private publication agency in Suzhou City has transported a large number of private opium to the countryside, hoping to sell it. The first batch of more than 2,000 taels has been transported away, and the second batch of more than 1,000 taels was loaded into a car and escorted by Guo. When they arrived at the Pingmen Bridge pier, they were spotted by the newly established anti-smoking bureau's anti-smuggling personnel, who considered their actions suspicious. They went forward to check and captured them on the spot. The bureau considered the case to be serious and telegraphed the department for instructions.</p>
<h3>Responding to the Western European War: Germany Has Confidence, Possessing a Large Number of Armored Units</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: The Berlin Financial Newspaper states that the German artillery line along the Western European coast, in addition to strong fortified positions with fortresses and deep trenches, also has other defensive equipment. Besides the passive defense line, there is also the most important active offensive weapon, namely the armored divisions. The main defense of the Western Front will undoubtedly be based on accumulating strength for offense, as in the past. Mobile armored units are ready to counterattack or concentrate firepower to sweep through enemy breakthrough points. The enemy's landing attempt takes the initiative because the enemy is in a position to choose an attack location and concentrate a large army on that point. The defending army must quickly mobilize troops to maintain balance. Therefore, large armored units and artillery must be ready for deployment at any time. The main task of armored vehicles is to repel the threats of airborne forces or paratroopers. Therefore, German armored forces are stationed in the French hinterland to detect enemy airborne landings. As for other secret measures to prepare for the counter-attack of Axis airborne troops, naturally, they cannot be revealed. Although the anti-Axis forces have numerical superiority, it will be difficult to match them with an equal number of German armored forces after landing, because even the largest transport aircraft can only carry light artillery and light tanks. To prevent air attacks, Germany's armored forces are completely different from those on the Eastern Front. The terrain of France and the dense transportation network provide sufficient secret cover for troop movements. In general, the overall armored forces in Western Europe are ready to thwart enemy attempts. The number of reserve armored forces is far greater than what was used in France in 1940. The war machine that the British and American forces will encounter when landing in France will be far more powerful than what they encountered in Sicily and the United States.</p>
<p>Breaking Through the Diversionary Tactic Strategy</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency military correspondent, Orpei, reports: Although the Soviet Union has announced that it has joined the major war related to the invasion of Europe, and the United Kingdom has repeatedly stated that preparations for the Western European offensive have been completed, in fact, the anti-Axis forces still show no signs of starting an offensive on all fronts simultaneously. The Soviet army's southern front is still east of the Dniester River, so the deduction of a general offensive on Europe from that area is inevitably premature. In the past few days, the Soviet army has fiercely attacked the bridgehead positions in Grigoriopol and Buda, proving that the Red Army values ​​this area as a starting point for future offensives. Large German air force units are heavily bombing the troops concentrated in Corsica. The anti-Axis forces concentrating large armies there and concentrating 3.5 million troops in southern England are using these areas and the southern coast of France to contain the German forces in Western Europe. However, this diversionary tactic strategy was long foreseen by the German High Command, and it will inevitably crush their plan. The German High Command has sufficient military strength and full confidence in the outcome of the war.</p>
<p>Roosevelt Sees European Offensive as Imminent</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports from Washington: President Roosevelt, when submitting the fifteenth report on the Lend-Lease Act to Congress yesterday, stated that the European offensive is about to begin. He said that the United Nations will now attack Europe from bases in the east, west, and south.</p>
<p>King George of England Inspects the Three Services</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports from London: General Montgomery, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the anti-Axis invasion of Europe, explained the final details of the invasion plan to King George VI. This morning, it was announced in London that the King inspected the troops commanded by Montgomery. These troops are currently in a certain location in England and will participate in the European offensive under the command of General Eisenhower. The King also inspected the domestic fleet and the Royal Air Force last week.</p>
<p>German Generals Confer on Defense</p>
<p>Vichy, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to Vichy radio broadcasts, Field Marshal Rundstedt, Commander-in-Chief of the German forces in Western Europe, conferred on defense with Field Marshal Rommel, one of his subordinates.</p>
<p>Sudden Train Stoppage in London</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: London news, yesterday, thousands of citizens waiting for trains at various stations in London suddenly heard that many trains were stopping, which was quite perplexing. The authorities have not issued a statement explaining the sudden stoppage of trains on most important trunk lines, and railway authorities have hinted that civilian travel may be completely banned.</p>

<p>Regarding the reorganization of the National Commerce Control Council and the reorganization of the rice procurement and distribution mechanism of the Rice Control Committee, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry specially came to Shanghai a few days ago to discuss with relevant authorities and summoned Chairman Tang Zimin of the Commerce Control Council and Chairman Yuan Fudeng of the Rice Control Committee to inquire in detail about the actual situation in the past and review the shortcomings, in order to seek smooth operation in the future.

<p>Japanese Allied Navy Memorial Day Special</p>
<h3>The Battle of Tsushima</h3>
<p>— by Mutō Sada</p>
<p>At that time, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Tōgō, was full of melancholy, not for any other reason. In the Battle of the Yellow Sea, although the enemy was caught, it could not be annihilated and escaped into the port of Port Arthur. The Battle of the Yellow Sea in August of Meiji 37 (1904) certainly thwarted the enemy fleet's attempt to escape from Port Arthur and suffered considerable damage, winning a victory, but it was not a complete victory.</p>
<p>Why couldn't a complete victory be achieved? At that time, the Combined Fleet did not go all out. Indeed, the Baltic Fleet was on its way east. In order to wait for this second enemy, when hitting less the first enemy (Far Eastern Fleet), extreme was taken to avoid injury. In the Port Arthur blockade, Commander Tōgō did not dare to launch a large-scale attack with the main fleet. If foreign reporters criticized Marshal Tōgō for being too cautious and lacking decisiveness before the Battle of the Yellow Sea, it might be a reckless judgment. But once the enemy in Port Arthur was annihilated, both body and mind were worn out, and when he was about to intercept the second enemy, the Baltic Fleet, Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō's great wisdom suddenly blossomed here.</p>
<p>The marshal's awe-inspiring courage had already had the ambition to swallow the enemy before the battle. Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama drafted the first report to the General Staff Headquarters, the first sentence of which was: "Received a report of the discovery of enemy ships," and the second sentence was "Planning to immediately launch an attack to intercept them." After seeing this, Marshal Tōgō immediately used a pencil to delete the "intercept" character from "intercept", adding the "annihilate" character.</p>
<p>At 3:30 AM on May 27th of Meiji 38 (1905), Admiral Tōgō had no other expression than a slight smile. He did not hesitate to go through fire and water. Now he was only focused on crushing the enemy to pieces. Here, he first issued an order to the entire fleet: "Discard fuel." In order to prepare for the event that the enemy fleet might turn to the Pacific Ocean and flee, he burned his boats, lightened the ship's body, and made a desperate all-out decisive battle.</p>
<p>It was almost time to confront the enemy, and the west wind was quite strong. To make the shooting accurate, it was first necessary to obtain the conditions of ship position and wind position. So he ordered the flagship Mikasa and the entire fleet to turn around in front of the enemy. Tōgō was taking a risk. The enemy was caught off guard, not knowing what mysterious tactics the Japanese army had, and was terrified, thus losing the most important opportunity to win. "Annihilation" had already succeeded at this time.</p>
<p>From our layman's point of view, when the time was so urgent, why use the beautiful descriptive words "The weather is clear, but the waves are quite high"? But with just this sentence, the General Staff Headquarters was already prepared to sing a triumphant song. If the weather was clear, it was evidence that the Combined Fleet did not have a "fog fleet" that was more annoying than the enemy. "The waves are quite high," the Japanese fleet had become accustomed to during normal maneuvers, but for foreign navies, it was a difficult situation that was rarely encountered and only recently experienced. Fortunately, "the waves were quite high" became an excellent condition for the Japanese Navy, while the enemy saw it as a fatal wound. This was probably the protection of the gods! The shocking waves raised the ambition to swallow mountains and rivers. But the enemy was panic-stricken and unable to fire its cannons.</p>
<p>"The weather is clear, but the waves are quite high," Admiral Tōgō had already predetermined the record of victory when he sent this telegram. (Translated by Xiang from Yomiuri Hochi)</p>

<p>Fulfilling one's duty is the most important thing for a human being, and it is especially important to first see what one's duty is.</p>
<h3>Do Not Abandon People</h3>
<p>All people have strengths. If one thinks like this, they can definitely be used. Those who will never forget loyalty and honesty should never be abandoned.</p>
<h3>Careful</h3>
<p>When crossing the street, keep a distance from vehicles.</p>
<h3>Knowing Shame</h3>
<p>The so-called knowing shame is a word that can be big or small and has a deep meaning. This is what the samurai of the past engraved in their hearts and never forgot. In a big way, when the country is in a difficult situation for the sake of righteousness, failure is the shame of the country. In a small way, one should never lag behind others in the way of sincerity.</p>
<h3>Beware of Clever Words and Flattering Expressions</h3>
<p>There are times in life when one must be straightforward.</p>
<h3>Talented People Lack Sincerity</h3>
<p>Talented people tend to rely on their talents and be arrogant, lacking sincerity. Therefore, although they can deceive others for a while, it is impossible to make them sincerely convinced.</p>
<h3>Trust</h3>
<p>Trust is the most important thing. The ancients placed it at the end of the five constant virtues, thinking that it had a deep meaning. No matter loyalty or filial piety, if they are not carried out with trust, it will be difficult to gain the trust of others.</p>
<h3>Famous Writing and Insight</h3>
<p>To be close to the truth of things, one must have insight. If one does not have it, even if the writing is famous, it is not worth reading.</p>
<h3>Changes in People's States of Mind</h3>
<p>People's psychological state is quite wonderful. In some situations, even life and death are not a problem. But this is even more true when responsibility is not heavy.</p>
<h3>Endurance as a Virtue for Women</h3>
<p>Things in the world cannot all be done as one thinks, so endurance is especially necessary. There are especially many unreasonable things that cannot be explained in the family. If everything is explained reasonably, there will inevitably be flaws. Therefore, one must have the first awakening of endurance. Nowadays, as women's rights are gradually increasing, the so-called endurance may be out of date, but once one becomes a wife and has a direct relationship with the family, even if one was self-willed when single, one should think deeply about it.</p>
<p>The so-called endurance mostly arises from sincerity. Therefore, if one sincerely cares for one's parents-in-law and husband, one can enhance one's endurance.</p>
<h3>Women Should Be Careful of Stubbornness</h3>
<p>If a woman is stubborn, it is most regrettable!</p>
<p>It is good to be careful to avoid stubbornness. To adhere to righteousness and act accordingly is correct. It is good to follow the teachings of parents and teachers. It is a pity that today there is too much willfulness!</p>
<h3>A Laissez-faire Policy is Not Feasible</h3>
<p>If the world were good, then it would be okay to let it be, or one could learn good things from it. However, it is especially impossible to implement it today. Mothers must pay the most attention to the education of their children. Even if fathers care, because they are often away, it is necessary for mothers to fully educate their children. The affairs of children are truly the most important things for mothers. (To be continued)</p>
