<h3>奉行汪主席遺志　特召開軍政會議　昨在京舉行隆重揭幕典禮</h3>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　中樞當局爲安民生而固國本，檢討過去，改進將來，使政府與人民打成一片，以强化政治軍事力量，協助大東亞戰爭，特召集各有關軍政長官，及各省市地方軍政最高負責者等一百餘人，於昨（二十四）在京隆重舉行全國軍政會議。上午八時，由陳代主席領導全體出席人員，恭謁國父陵寢，獻花化致敬。九時正，大會舉行搖幕禮，到中外來賓，顧監察院長忠琛，李教育部長聖五，丁社會部長默邨，陳司法行政部長恩普。盟邦派遣軍松井總參謀長，矢崎最高軍事顧問，大野戰兵司令官，淺海少將，淺井參謀等數十人。行禮如儀後，全體出席人員並向注故主席默哀致敬。嗣陳代主席致訓詞，盟邦松井總參謀畏致詞，周副院長·梅內政部長·鮑總參謀長·分別致詞，語意懇切詳明，對今後全國軍政推進方針，指示頗多。迄十一時許揭幕儀式始於全體攝影留念後，宣告完畢。</p>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　全國軍政會議於昨（二十四）日下午三時，舉行第一次懇談會。陳行政院長兼軍事委員會委員長以下全體出列席人員，均行參加。由各省市地方長官報告施政現况，華北政務委員會綏靖總署督辦杜錫鈞，山東省長唐仰杜，天津特別市長張仁　，湖北省長兼武漢綏靖主任楊揆一，廣東省長兼綏靖主任陳春圑，上海特別市長陳公博（盧央代表），南京特別市長周學昌，先後起立，就主管區情况，詳盡報告。迄下午六時許，第一次懇談，始告一段落。</p>
<p>堅定信念加強團強　周副院長訓詞</p>
<p>南京廿四日中央社電　周副院長訓詞大意：各位同志，今天在汪故至席擇葬的第二日，舉行這全國軍政會議，意義是很重大的。自汪主席逝世以後，我們就如同失掉了一位統帥，一位導師，這損失是如何的重大。適才陳代主席的訓詞中，再三的明示，應繼續努力完成汪故主席的遺志，本人更以爲雖然主席逝世，我們已失掉導師統帥，但必須仍如汪故主席在世一樣，照舊的繼續工作，照舊的作戰奮鬥。希望每個負有重責的官長，各負其責，完成領袖之遺志，爲國家前途而努力。本人特藉今天會議的機會，提出幾點，和大家討諭。（一）堅定信仰，國家的戰局，日趨嚴重，在這樣動搖的時代下，全國軍民上下同志，務必要立下最大決心，堅定信念。當初和運開始之時，若不是以最大的努力與奮鬥，絕不會有現在這樣的成績。如今不但實現了原定的計劃，而且還超過預期的成果。例如治外法權的撒廢，各國租界的收回，都是偉大的證明。所以和運開始之時，即是以信迎克服一切困難，也可以說信仰是和運的先導。（二）振作精神，能振作精神　才能實行信念，如不振作精神，即無前途。革命之所以能推翻淸廷，即是這種精神的力量，希望大家積極振奮、要以做事爲第一要務，（三）加強團結，地方應與中央互相協力加强圑結，使全國統一。在陳代主領導之下，共同前進，無論任何變動，只要同生共死，定能應付時艱。反之，如整個的團體失敗，則個人的一切，亦必將完全失敗。（四）爭取民衆，我們在目前環境之下，從不能積極的爲民衆謀利益，至少要消極的爲民衆解除痛苦，把握民心，便是目前最重要的一個工作。應該「取之於民，用之於民，」以獲得民衆的信仰，爲民衆解除苦痛，才能奠定民衆圑結的基礎</p>
<p>此會左右中國前途　松井總參謀長致詞</p>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　全國軍政會議席上，盟邦駐華派遣軍總參謀長松幷中將致詞，原文如下：故汪主席遺靈安葬之追憶尚新的今天，能够在這裏舉行軍政會議，並且敝人也附諸位閣下驥尾，得有參加本會議的機會，這是敝人覺得最大光榮，最大感激。</p>
<p>敝人以爲這一次的會議，比較從前的會議更有嚴肅而且重大的意義，可以說是在主席逝世後，可以左右中國之前途，全恃在這一次的會議。本來諸位閣下，本有泆心，同時我們也抱有深刻的關心，來期望本會議的成果。</p>
<p>在此機會，對於汪主席之逝世，我們只有衷心表示哀悼之誠意。回憶汪主席對於建設東亞和平之卓見與經綸，除了祈禱着他的冥福之外，沒有其他的感想。</p>
<p>主席訃報一傳，國民上下極爲悲痛，幸有老練高明的陳代主席閣下，以及諸位閣下的一絲不亂的指導統制，各界均無動搖，現在大家須要克服主席逝世的悲哀，官民一致，毅然向繼承遺志之大道邁進，這是極堪欣慰的。</p>
<p>在本月二十日，陳代主席就任典禮時，他曾明示方針如下：「繼承在主席遺志，强力推進，肅正思想，確立治安，增加生產三大致策，藉此完遂大東亞戰爭，達成和平建國。」我們對他的這熱烈意氣和壯圖，表示滿腔的欽佩。加之今天又有諸位閣下的光盬，對於上列政策，能够加以澈底協讓，加强實踐方策，本人覺得這是非常得機宜，同時值得慶祝的一件事。</p>
<p>在華日本派遣軍根據日本帝國政府屢次的聲明，遵照中日同盟之道義，始終堅持改定方針，對於所有部門今後均有更加　密提携之決心，所希望者，便是請各位以虛心坦懷之態度，來接受我們的提携。</p>
<p>現在特別對於軍界關係的各位講一講，自從省長兼綏靖主任之制度施行以來，地方治安之向上，必有希望。鑒於今後的情勢，中日兩軍之提携協力愈感必要。我們對於在華日本各軍隊，已下了與中國軍隊緊密提携的訓令，切　中國方面，也把此種精神澈底强調。</p>
<p>日本方面近來在台灣菲律賓獲得了巨大戰果，同時大陸戰綫亦進展到桂林柳州，一面確立不敗之鐵壁態勢，一面殲滅　慢敵方，抱定堅固的必勝之信念，爲了保衛大東亞而戰鬥。</p>
<p>希望諸位閣下，明察大局，不問在中央，在地方，爲中國，爲更亞，以陳代主席閣下爲中心，一致圑結，來完遂興華保亞之大業。</p>
<p>最后對於過去中國方面所給與我們的協力，表示謝意。同時慶祝中國將來之發展，借這機會，表示警意。</p>

<h3>民必先安國治自立　—陳代主席訓詞—</h3>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　全國軍政會議席上，陳代主席訓詞原文如下：</p>
<p>奉行遺志努力邁進</p>
<p>各位次我們遭遇了極大的不幸，就是我們的領袖汪先生，在創業將成，而棄我們中道殂逝，我知道全國國民和諸位長官，一樣的哀痛和悼的。震但是在今日，國步艱難的時期，我們並不單是哀痛和震悼，就可以慰汪先生在天之靈，必須我們都肩起責任，奉行遺忘，才可以完成汪先生未完的夙志。因此，我們乘着各位來京奉葬之際，舉行這個全國軍政長官的會議。</p>
<p>本人會於本月二十日，發布施政方針，開宗明義有兩句話，「凡注主席手定之政策，皆爲公博奉行之政策；凡汪先生生前之設施，皆爲公博今日之設施。」就是表示本人並不願標新立異，另定方針。因爲國民政府的方針，早於民國二十九年還都的時候確定了，其餘設施也於四年多以來，陸續頒布了。今日我們所缺乏的，不是理論，不是政策，所缺乏的祗是毅力，祗是決心。以前所定的政策，或者因於客觀的障碍，或者因於主觀的決意，未能一實行。今後我們惟有努力掃除障碍，堅定決意，把汪先生未完的事業的，都負起資任來幹。就是本人在本月二十日所舉幾個綱目，第一要協同日本完成大東亞戰爭，第二要促進統一和平，第三要澄淸吏治，第四要繼續生產，第五要確立治安，這都不是本人新定的政策，而是以前遠則二十年，近則數年來所定的政策。例如反對帝國主義，早定於民國十三年，國民黨改組的當時。澄淸吏治，是實行於民國十四年，國民政府成立於廣州的當時，至於促進全面和平，則爲國民政府還都的目的，繼續生產，確立治安，則爲參加大東亞戰爭所必需的要件。不過以前，或者因爲革命中斷，或者因爲時局變遷，有些實行至半途便停頓了，有些行之而尚未收效罷了。</p>
<p>保華興亞責任重大</p>
<p>凡本人所舉的綱目，都期在必行，而行之必期其有效。汪先生逝世以後，本人和諸位的責任，都加重了，所望各位務必體念汪先生的遺志，及洞矚中國的前途，努力實行，以求復興中國，而無恭於我們後死的責任罷。</p>
<p>今日在全國軍政會議席上，我更想指出兩點，促各位的注意。第一無論任何國家，要想圖存，要想復興，最靠得住的辦法，是靠日己，不要倚賴人。我們縱觀歷史，橫觀現代，無論任何國家，斷沒有依賴別人永遠帮助，而可倖存之理。以大東亞戰爭而論，大東亞戰爭的目的，是爲求東亞全民族的解放。以中國參戰而論，是求中國本身的解放，但民族要求解放，完全要靠自己的努力。一個國家要求自由獨立，也要全靠百己的努力。我要告訴諸位，自己努力之途徑甚多，而最要之點，則旣爲參戰的國家，即有參戰國的責任，同時即應盡參戰國之義務。政府的基礎，尤應使政府建築於人民之上，而不應樹立於人民以外。因爲國家之構成是人民，政府之天職，一方固然要領導人民，而一方允貴於能代表人民。倘若政府與人民分離，則政府亦告崩潰，其他努力概爲詞費。所以我要告訴各位，負政治和軍事之責的，應該激底明瞭此旨。簡單言之，政府決須與人民打成一片，自力更生，民必先安，國治自立，旭果這一點做不到，我與諸位都是失職，而成爲國家的罪人的。</p>
<p>檢計過去改進將來</p>
<p>第二，無論任何政府要想强化，要想自立，最要緊是有日發精神。政府的最大作用，不外兩者，其一是發動，其二是鞭策，缺此兩者，政府便不能自存。然而有發動，才能有鞭策，但怎樣才能發動呢？最要緊是自己檢討了。有檢討才有改進，檢討是發動的原因，改進是發動的結果。我這次召集會議，完全是要檢討過去改進將來。一年以來，據我個人的檢討，我覺得非常危險。諭政治則紀綱漸墜，政府與人民已形分離。論軍事則訓練鬆弛，人民與軍隊不能合作，而且在國民政府治下，行省不爲不多，可是無一縣之治理使人滿意。軍隊亦不爲不多，而跬步之內，皆有匪踪，似這樣情形，我們軍還能自稱復與中華，保衛東亞嗎？因此我們的政治和軍事，應該重新檢討，機構的連襲，制度的運用，軍隊的佈置，綏靖的計劃，都有澈底改進之必要。我極希望今天到會各位，盡量各抒已見，使我們的政治和軍事，得到一個更生的決策。</p>
<p>昨日在先生已安葬了，汪先生遺志都要大家奮起，才能完成。希望各位更加堅定，更加沉着，更加努力，不要動搖，不要衝動，不要懈怠，以救國家，以安人民。中央旣定的方針，希望各位努力推行，各位如有困難，中央亦必巷各位負責解決。今日在國步艱難之時，我們紙有崗位職務不同，並無中央和地方之分野。各位爲困難即中央的困難，各位的成功，亦即是中央的成功。更可以設，天下之樂，即爲本人與各位之樂，天下之憂，即爲本人與各位之憂，今日眞是生死存亡關頭，最後之努力，尚希各位與本人共勉之。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>軍政會議的使命</h3>
<p>中樞當局乘各地方軍政長官到京參加汪主席葬典之便，特舉行全國軍政會議。這會議在客觀上有兩種很好的機會：第一，各地方軍政長官參加汪主席葬典，並非單純在禮節上的酬應，主要的是因此促起共同奉行汪主席遺志的決心。第二，各地十方軍政長官很難聚晤一堂，這次均能遠道前來。所以，中樞當局把握這兩個機會舉行會議，我們相信比較專門召集的全體性會議，收獲更多。</p>
<p>對於這次會議的期待，在陳代主席及周副院長的訓詞中，已經講得很明白扼要。我們更相信各地方的軍政長宮身負國家付託之重，必能體味當局的意志，各自站在本身崗位，盡其最大的努力。我們願就所感，略論如次：</p>
<p>（一）希望大家必須說老實話，坦白的檢討過去。陳代主席說：「有檢討才有改進」。檢討了過去的弱點缺點，就可作爲改進的張本。所以，檢討必須老實無欺，過去的缺失，並無可恥，祗須今後切實改進。古人說過：「不貴無過，但貴改過；不患無過，但患文過」。對於自己的缺失，不肯坦白檢討，偏要文過飾非，這就絕無改進的可能。不但自己葬送前途，而國家前途也被葬送了。</p>
<p>（二）希望大家必須發揮自尊心，放棄依賴推諉的劣性。陳代主席又說：「任何國家，要想圖存，要想復興，最靠得住的辦法，是靠自己，不要依賴人」。這已明白昭示我們依賴是不可靠的。凡是心存依賴的人，大都缺乏自尊心的。個人的生存，如果依賴他人，一定很危險，而國家的生存，決計不能作依賴打算。我們反對重慶政權完全依賴英美，毫無自尊之心。另一方面，國民政府雖與日本有同盟的關係，也不能存着依賴心理。因爲依賴以後，不但毀滅自尊，而且增重別人的負擔。所以，不但政府與官更應該自發自尊，以身作則，同時，倡導人民也自須尊自發。</p>
<p>（三）希望逐漸做到確立治安。目前和平區內各地治安，實在太危險了，誠如陳代主席說：「軍隊不爲不多，而跬步之內，皆有匪踪」。確是痛切之詞。國家養兵是爲保境安民，如今安民不足擾民有餘，太不成話了。所以，對於軍隊的澈底改進，實爲迫不容緩的要政。</p>
<p>（四）希望建立民意機關。「政府與人民分離，則政府亦告崩潰。」「政府必須與人民打成一片，自力更生，民必先安，國治自立。」這是陳代主席所誠摯指出的。我們始終認爲溝通民意，非建立民意機關不可。眞正民意機關雖一時未能成立，而類似的民意機關必須普遍建立，俾逐漸養成人民參政的習慣，眞正達到政府與人民打成一片。</p>
<p>最後，我們對於這次會議，視爲決定國運前途的會議，幷不過分。誠如盟邦松井總參謀長說：「注主席逝世以後，可以左右中國之前途，全恃在這次會議」。足見盟邦人士觀察之溧，認識之淸。我們希望這次會議以後，政府各級常局從此自發振作，向確立治安，修明政治之途邁進，人民協同政府推行政令。同時，更希望盟邦現地當局重視中國國情民情，協力支持中國政府的政令。我們認爲政府單方面的努力是不够的，需要人民的協力；而政府與人民雙方的努力，還是不够的，更需要盟邦協力，惟有三方面的一致協力，才能改進中國現狀，同時，有利於大東亞戰爭的爭取勝和。</p>
<h3>汪故主席安葬記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員寒若</p>
<p>上海方面赴京恭祭在主席並參加執紼代表，於二十一二十二兩日，先後赴京。二十二日下午四時，代表圑由潘達參事率領趨主席靈前致祭。</p>
<p>禮堂一督</p>
<p>難鳴寺下之國民政府，已全部披上素服，在國府大門首，下了半旗的黨國旗下，恭立着四名警衛勇士，槍縷黑紗，形態肅穆。進門迎面陳列着備移靈用的砲車一輛，上奉主席繪像一幀。國府大禮堂安置靈櫬，　前供奉大幅遺像，素燭高燒，淸香一樓。軍樂一隊，於靈傍伴奏哀章，左側室內爲哀典委員會之辦事處，職員多人，正忙於收錄輓對祭幛花圈。迎送致祭之外交貴寶，有外交部專員專司其職。各方致祭人員，絡繹不絕。</p>
<p>安葬日之晨</p>
<p>安葬大典定於二十三日晨六時半開始，十二時後完畢。哀典委員會執事人員二十二日澈夜未眠，備極辛勞。重要執拂人士，規定於二十三日晨間六時前齊集於國民政府禮堂，故保泰街，成賢街，中山路上五時許即人影移動，開警衛人員及執紼民衆，在四時左右開始佈置。記者於五時許乘馬車向國府出發，國府門前，軍警密佈，參加執紼者已沿考試路列隊恭候，軍政長官及外交使節先後到達，移靈典禮於六時半舉行，依照秩序在禮砲大鳴聲中完畢，緊接發引啓靈，斯時東方微露白色，時六時五十三分。</p>
<p>去年十一月二十三日，第二屆全國宣傳會議舉行於中德文化協會，主席於下午四時茶會招待出席代表，親臨致訓，記者與會，面聆訓示。今年又逢十一月二十三日，恰爲一年，聞去年該日爲主席公開與外界人士晤面之最後一次，嗣後即因健康關係未作大規查勘的接見晉謁人員。今晶此時此地，此一代偉人即將永眠樂土。</p>
<p>綿長的執紼行列</p>
<p>七時許，　黑紗的主席旗在護旗長官捧奉之下，莊嚴地綏緩從國府大門口出現，後隨侍衛軍官，以白盤恭捧主席生前所配之動章軍刀，陳代主席御新國民服首先步出，步伐沉毅，戚容滿面。靈櫬安供於砲車之上，上覆黨國撫，以馬八匹駕之緩緩而行，舁機人員及家屬隨侍兩側，其後爲各委員及外交使節。其他恭送代表均按照預定區位，排列恭送。當州靈櫬出國府大門之際，在塲人員均致敬禮，天已大亮，萬籟俱寂，僅有輕微的步聲及哀步聲，樹枝小鳥亦噤聲低首，似對英靈表示哀思。</p>
<p>恭送行列長達十數里，久居南京者謂自總理峯安禮後所未有之莊嚴偉大喪禮，行列經過中山門，歷時一小時又三十八分。前列已抵梅花山，從中山門高處西望後列尚無止境，絻幛旗幟猶在新街口招展移動。</p>
<p>植立於道傍民衆，十數里不斷。南京盟邦居留民門口之日章旗，均下半旗誌哀，婦孺並手執旗幟恭迎恭送，足徵主席精神感召，遠近靡遺。</p>
<p>百五十餘名槓夫</p>
<p>靈櫬車駕由馬拖至梅花山下，由山下墓門一段，係由特種槓夫抬送上山。槓夫一百五十七名，由華北政務委員會在北京特選，是全國聞名的同生槓房的槓夫，政委會特派專員率領南下，恭舁主席靈櫬安葬。此一班槓夫經騐豐富，長處在穩與妥，聞當年光緒帝及慈禧太后之靈櫬以及總理奉安時均用該槓房之槓夫。槓夫六四名一班，計分兩班抬櫬，另有擊尺指揮人員，一個個都是光頭梢長大漢，穿白衣及藍衣，肩着茶杯粗盤的短槓，挺胸凸肚，隨行列前進，如果在他們頭上加上一頂翅翎帽，倒活像蜡廟的金大力。</p>
<p>梅花山暫眠地</p>
<p>暫時安葬地之梅花山爲附園地區之一，山下至墓門一帶，由靑秒年團及模範聯隊維持秩序。服裝整齊，此一批領袖手植之壯健英勇靑秒年，爲最後一次爲領袖服役之故，倍極辛勞。</p>
<p>六十四名槓夫穿綠色衣抬靈櫬上山，至墓前後另由二十四名穿白衣者抬至壙穴。時爲十時十七分。十一時正，由陳代主席領導舉行安葬典禮，典畢，二十時餘，槓夫綏綏舁靈櫬入壙，汪夫人含淚撥第一把土覆棺上，其餘人員次第覆土。至此，此劃時代的偉人，即與其親愛共患難之部屬永別，將復興中華保衛東亞之重責交卸與後人矣。（寄自南京）</p>

<p>主席聞蘭亭致詞：宇佐美公使閣下，土田公使閣下，諸位來賓，今天本市市商會，市民福利協會，中國新聞協會，中國國民外交促進會等四個圑體，歡送宇佐美公使閣下，同時歡迎新任土田公使閣下，承蒙諸位參加，非常欣幸。宇佐美公使今年四月間來滬就任，七個月來，種種協力，表示感謝。現在轉任大東亞省，雖然離開上海，但是間接方面，與上海還是有關係的，希望今後隨時指示。土田公使這次從華北轉任來南，我們雖是初交，但對公使在華北服務的政聲，早已仰佩了，今後我們時常有承敎的機會，還請不吝指敎。上海原是一個五方雜處的社會情形非常複雜，同時又爲經濟文化的中心，地位卻非常重要，一切處理得當，可以貢獻戰爭力量，可以促進中日合作，盡其後方重要基地的責任。尤其在目前整僩大東亞戰局漸入緊張階段，上海的地位益見重要，而問題的處理，也益見艱難，所以掌握上海欋責的中日當局，更加需要才智與愼重。目前上海的主要課題，　是民生的如何穩定。簡單的說，民生安定辦不到，祗少要做到穩定，中國人的慾望並不高，如果最低限度的生活尚不能穩定，共他一切問題說得怎樣動聽，也是很難瞭解的。當然，在這個時候，要忍受一切痛苦，共問爭取勝利，可是忍受痛苦是有限度的，換句話說，不必要的痛苦，可以避免的痛苦，因爲人謀不藏的痛苦，因爲不合國情的痛苦，都是不必忍受的。我們希望就這一個界限，多做些穩定民生的工作，就是間接做中日協力的工作。今年四月二十一日我在歡迎宇佐美公使席上說過：「盼望推誠相與，促成中·日合作未完工作」，現在仍以此兩語，貢默於土田公使，敬祝兩位公使閣下健康。</p>
<p>宇佐美詞</p>
<p>繼由宇佐美公使致詞，略謂：「今日承上海四團體聯合歡送，誠覺無上光榮。本人在任期內，承蒙各界協力援助，尤覽感激，藉此機會以表謝意。今日職局日趨激烈，整個大東亞之命運，唯在此一戰，中國爲參戰之一份，允望今後能發揮全力，與日本共同協力，一方面能增進中日兩國同盟關係，使中日親善提携益爲增強，另一方面能共同協力，藉以驅逐吾等之敵人英美，達到大東亞共存共榮之至高理想。本人不久即將離任東返，現由土田公使負此重任。土田公使爲經騐豐富，學識淵博者，此次來滬，一方面固能指導日本現地各界，另一方面更能代表日本方面與滬上各界，共同協力，共同合作，希望今後各界能以援助本人之力更多多與土田公使合作協力，則不但中日合作能得以促進，且更能向確得大東亞戰爭勝利途，繼續邁進。」</p>
<p>土田氏詞</p>
<p>後由土田公使致詞謂：「今日承蒙滬上各有力團體歡迎，誠覺愉快。本人滯留貴國華北期問較長，對滬上情形，本人深知上海爲一極複雜之都市，欲解決種種問題頗爲不易，故今後尚望各位能多予援助。剛才聞先生說過在戰爭期內，各種苦痛在所難免，唯不必要之苦痛，可不必加能人民。本人對此深爲同感。在大東亞戰爭已屆決戰階段之際，中日兩國應盡最大努力向必勝之途邁進，假如此次戰爭不幸失敗，全東亞之命運必甚悽慘，大東亞數萬萬民族將無抬頭之日，是以非打倒英美敵人致最後勝利不可。中日兩國過去會有同盟條約及大東亞會議等關係，希望以後能根據此基本原則，共同奮鬥，並盼滬上各有力團體，能多援助協力，則本人之幸。」</p>
<p>吳頌臯詞</p>
<p>最後由吳秘書長致詞略謂，對宇佐美公使在滬期間之種種協力，表示深切之感謝。過去市府施政方針，側重於協力戰爭與安定民生，今後亦然。惟有協力戰爭與安定民生相輔而行，方能及早獲致最後勝利。</p>

<h3>防空本部促市民　注意空襲待避　俾減低空襲死傷</h3>
<p>上海特別市市民防空本部當局，頃發表談話如下：「大東亞戰爭，已呈決戰勢態，日軍在菲島與美軍浴血　戰，在中國則直前橫切西南一隅，卒使美空軍坐困昆明，一籌莫展。英美唆使重慶首當要衝，其在華空軍與重慶方面主力，共遭日軍之重大威脅，敵人在太平洋拼命進攻，一面企圖截斷日軍後方連絡，與空襲日本內地，終於曇花一現，盡歸子虛而已。然重慶成都等處之殘餘美空軍部隊，猶冀以神經戰方式，張揚宣傳，不絕蠢蠢思動，已於本年十一月十一日，及二十一日，侵入和平中樞之上海，濫施轟炸。無論美空軍來滬之目的何在，吾人目擊敵機躬受侵襲，獲得甚多在民防空工作推進上有矯正必要之貴重經騐。茲將其公開發表，以供將來參考，藉以確立民防空勢態。</p>
<p>空襲開始發即須待避</p>
<p>（一）十一日及二十一日之空襲損書，雖極輕微，不無傷亡之人，至爲憾事。除從事防空壯烈殉職者外，大多數傷亡之原因，非爲炸彈，而爲敵機之機關槍彈，或雙方空戰時之流彈。足見民衆對於空襲危險，尚未充分認識，甚至有爲好奇心所激，冒險眺望者，實係訓練不澈底所致。防空當局已在決定實施中之待避指導要綱內，竭力說明。每逢目睹機影，耳聞機聲，或見空襲開始，即須迅速待避，且如敵機在超空度上空擲彈時，其發射點與着地點，即在平地上測量，亦相距甚遠，故空製警報發令後，目睹或耳聞敵機時，固無待言，如能一知上海境內空戰開始，立即自動敏捷待避，則決無一人遭受無妄之災。</p>
<p>工廠須建待避設施</p>
<p>（二）茲就一實例而觀，本市某區某處，雖爲炸彈所命中，幾無一人傷亡，此蓋機敏之防空指導者，引導全體人員向預設之壕所妥善待避，始獲此良果。吾人對於待避設施之重要，與相機措置之效騐，更覺確信無疑。工人在空襲時之沉着定，爲確保生產之絕對必要條件。各工廠須先建築可收容全部從業員極完備之待避設施，幷須採取有秩序之訓練，於命令一下，服從指揮。此外一般家庭或其他可收容多數人之團體，亦須積極建造待設施。保田等應利用適當之空地，俾慫慂建造公共待避壉，再待避壕當以地下式較地上式爲理想，無蓋式待避壕恐因天空落下物之危險，故當以有蓋式者爲佳。又向未指定爲公共待避所之建築物，應協力收容路上待避者，俾各符其實」。（未完）</p>
<h3>日艦隊報道部　放映海戰影片</h3>
<p>盟邦日本駐華艦隊報道部，爲介紹最近菲島海戰捷况，及神風特別攻擊隊之赫赫戰果，特於昨（二十四）日下午二時，假南京路外灘華懋飯店八樓試映室放映「菲島大海戰」新聞片，招待本市中日外報道有關各方。二時前八樓試映室瞬告滿座，首由鹽田大尉報告放映影片順序，繼由松島報道部長就菲島戰况，及日軍殲敵戰果闡明綦詳，幷介紹新聞片內容，乃即開始放映「菲島大海戰」，日軍神勇滅敵，擊毀敵機，及神風特別攻擊隊之壯烈出發，猛轟敵艦，一一映諸銀幕，至下午四時始畢。</p>
<p>松島致詞</p>
<p>松島艦隊報道部長在招待中日外報道有關各方放映「菲島大海戰」新聞片時，致詞報告，略謂：「今日承諸君百忙中撥冗踴躍光臨，深爲感謝，自本年十月十日以還，日陸海軍在台東菲東海面，對敵美軍予以嚴重深刻之打擊。而敵方對此次作戰結果，損失竟含糊發表，掩飾敗戰，惟上海猶有一般無智識者，誤信敵美虛僞。今敵方不論如何宣傳，而日本已達到完成勝利之境。對敵殘餘機動部隊，加以殲滅之中。敵美在此役中，不論航空母艦，及其他各種艦船，損失慘重。且日軍在菲之制海制空權，操握掌中，幷已展開對敵全面之殲滅戰，故敵對雷伊泰灣之企圖，即將全盤粉碎，日軍決能完全達到。最近敵軍發見日軍時，即逃遁亂竄，今將此役作戰眞相，放映於諸君之前，將來當絡續將關於戰况電影，分次放映」。</p>

<h3>Carrying Out Chairman Wang's Last Wishes: A Special Military and Political Conference Is Solemnly Inaugurated in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - To secure the people's livelihood and strengthen the foundation of the nation, the central authorities convened a National Military and Political Conference in Nanjing yesterday (the 24th). The conference, attended by over one hundred high-ranking military and political officials and top regional military and political leaders from various provinces and cities, was held to review the past, improve the future, unite the government and the people, strengthen political and military power, and assist in the Greater East Asia War. At 8:00 a.m., Acting Chairman Chen led all attendees in paying respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, presenting flowers and offering their respects. At 9:00 a.m. sharp, the opening ceremony was held, with the presence of Chinese and foreign guests. These included Gu Zhongchen, President of the Control Yuan; Li Shengwu, Minister of Education; Ding Mocun, Minister of Social Affairs; and Chen Enpu, Minister of Judicial Administration. Allied nations dispatched General Chief of Staff Matsui, Supreme Military Advisor Yazaki, Commander of the Field Army Ohno, Rear Admiral Asahai, Staff Officer Asai, and dozens of others. After the formal proceedings, all attendees observed a moment of silence to pay their respects to the late Chairman. Subsequently, Acting Chairman Chen delivered a speech, followed by addresses from Allied nations General Chief of Staff Matsui, Vice President Zhou, Minister of Interior Mei, and General Chief of Staff Bao, each speaking earnestly and comprehensively, providing significant guidance on the future direction of national military and political advancement. The inauguration ceremony concluded at around 11:00 a.m. with a group photo.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - The National Military and Political Conference held its first informal meeting yesterday (the 24th) at 3:00 p.m. All attendees, including Chen, the President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, participated. Regional officials from various provinces and cities reported on the current state of administration. Du Xijun, Supervisor of the Pacification General Office of the North China Political Affairs Commission; Tang Yangdu, Governor of Shandong Province; Zhang Ren, Mayor of Tianjin Special Municipality; Yang Kuiyi, Governor of Hubei Province and concurrently Director of Wuhan Pacification; Chen Chuntuan, Governor of Guangdong Province and concurrently Director of Pacification; Chen Gongbo, Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality (representing Lu Yang); and Zhou Xuechang, Mayor of Nanjing Special Municipality, each stood up to provide detailed reports on the situation in their respective jurisdictions. The first informal meeting concluded at around 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Strengthen Faith, Enhance Solidarity: Vice President Zhou's Address</p>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - The gist of Vice President Zhou's address: Fellow comrades, today, on the second day after the burial of the late Chairman Wang, we are holding this National Military and Political Conference, which is of great significance. Since the passing of Chairman Wang, we have felt as though we have lost a commander and a mentor, a loss of immense magnitude. In Acting Chairman Chen's address just now, he repeatedly emphasized the need to continue our efforts to fulfill the late Chairman Wang's legacy. I believe that although the Chairman has passed away and we have lost our mentor and commander, we must continue to work and fight as if the late Chairman Wang were still with us. I hope that every official bearing a heavy responsibility will fulfill their duties, complete the leader's legacy, and strive for the future of the nation. I would like to take this opportunity to present a few points for discussion with everyone: (1) Strengthen faith: The national war situation is becoming increasingly severe. In this era of turmoil, all comrades, both military and civilian, must make the greatest determination and strengthen their faith. When the peace movement began, without the greatest effort and struggle, we would never have achieved the results we have today. Now, we have not only realized our original plans but have also exceeded our expected outcomes. For example, the abolition of extraterritoriality and the recovery of foreign concessions are great proofs of this. Therefore, from the beginning of the peace movement, we have overcome all difficulties with faith, and it can be said that faith is the precursor to the peace movement. (2) Revitalize spirit: Only by revitalizing our spirit can we put our faith into practice. Without revitalizing our spirit, we have no future. The reason why the revolution was able to overthrow the Qing Dynasty was due to the power of this spirit. I hope everyone will actively invigorate themselves and make doing things their top priority. (3) Strengthen solidarity: Local areas should cooperate with the central government to strengthen solidarity and unify the nation. Under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, we must move forward together. No matter what changes occur, as long as we share life and death, we will be able to cope with the difficulties of the times. Conversely, if the entire group fails, then everything of the individual will also completely fail. (4) Win over the people: Under the current circumstances, we cannot actively seek benefits for the people, but at the very least, we must passively relieve the people's suffering. Grasping the hearts of the people is the most important task at present. We should "take from the people, use for the people" to gain the people's trust, relieve the people's suffering, and lay the foundation for the unity of the people.</p>
<p>This Conference Influences China's Future: Address by General Chief of Staff Matsui</p>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - At the National Military and Political Conference, General Chief of Staff Matsui of the Allied Forces stationed in China delivered the following address: Today, as the memory of the late Chairman Wang's burial is still fresh, I am able to attend this military and political conference, and I am greatly honored and grateful to have this opportunity to join you all.</p>
<p>I believe that this conference is more solemn and significant than previous conferences. It can be said that after the passing of the Chairman, the future of China depends entirely on this conference. Originally, all of you have a strong determination, and at the same time, we also have a deep concern and look forward to the results of this conference.</p>
<p>On this occasion, we can only express our sincere condolences for the passing of Chairman Wang. Recalling Chairman Wang's insightful views and strategies for building East Asian peace, we have no other thoughts but to pray for his soul's peace.</p>
<p>When the news of the Chairman's death was announced, the people were extremely grieved. Fortunately, with the experienced and wise leadership of Acting Chairman Chen and the orderly guidance and control of all of you, there was no wavering in all sectors. Now, everyone must overcome the sorrow of the Chairman's death, and the government and the people must unite and resolutely move forward on the path of inheriting his legacy. This is extremely gratifying.</p>
<p>On the 20th of this month, at the inauguration ceremony of Acting Chairman Chen, he clearly stated the following policy: "Inherit the legacy of the late Chairman, vigorously promote and correct thought, establish security, and increase production to complete the Greater East Asia War and achieve a peaceful nation." We express our full admiration for his passionate spirit and grand plan. In addition, with the presence of all of you today, we can thoroughly discuss and strengthen the implementation of the above policies. I feel that this is a very opportune and celebratory event.</p>
<p>Based on the repeated statements of the Japanese Imperial Government, the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China adhere to the righteousness of the Sino-Japanese alliance and consistently adhere to the policy of revision. We are determined to cooperate more closely in all sectors in the future. What we hope is that everyone will accept our cooperation with a humble and open mind.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to speak specifically to those involved in military affairs. Since the implementation of the system of provincial governors concurrently serving as pacification directors, there is hope for the improvement of local security. In light of the future situation, cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese armies is increasingly necessary. We have issued instructions to all Japanese troops in China to cooperate closely with the Chinese army, and we urge the Chinese side to thoroughly emphasize this spirit.</p>
<p>Recently, Japan has achieved great victories in Taiwan and the Philippines, and at the same time, the continental front has also advanced to Guilin and Liuzhou. While establishing an invincible iron wall, we are annihilating the slow enemy and holding firm to the belief in certain victory to fight for the defense of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>I hope that all of you will clearly understand the overall situation and, whether in the central government or in the regions, for China and for Greater Asia, unite around Acting Chairman Chen to complete the great cause of revitalizing China and protecting Asia.</p>
<p>Finally, I express my gratitude for the cooperation that China has given us in the past. At the same time, I celebrate the future development of China and take this opportunity to express my concerns.</p>
<h3>In the Sea East of Mindanao: Japanese Aircraft Attack Enemy Convoy, Sinking Four Vessels Including an Aircraft Carrier and a Cruiser</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 p.m. on the 24th: (1) From the 21st to the 23rd, Japanese air units attacked enemy transport convoys and their escort vessels in the sea east of Mindanao Island, destroying one enemy aircraft carrier and sinking two enemy transport ships and one cruiser or destroyer. The Japanese side suffered only five aircraft that did not return to base. (2) Regarding the results of the bombing of the enemy mobile unit in the sea east of Luzon Island by Japanese air units on November 19, which was announced earlier, we are now adding the destruction of three enemy ships of unknown type.</p>
<h3>A Major Decisive Battle Unfolds Over Leyte Island: US Army's Land Transportation Route Cut Off</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Base on the Philippine Front, 24th (Central News Agency) - Elite Japanese air units have recently launched a full-scale aerial annihilation battle against the enemy centered on Leyte Island. The enemy is also frantically maneuvering to secure an air base, so the airspace over Leyte has become a decisive battlefield for the air force. Since the enemy landed on Leyte Island, from October 15 to November 17, for about a month, they have launched approximately 9,000 aircraft to attack the Philippines. However, their ambitions have been shattered by the fierce interception of the Japanese air force. The remaining landing forces on Leyte have also gradually shown signs of decline due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese air and land forces. To desperately reverse this decline, the enemy has repeatedly dispatched transport convoys and fleets to Leyte Bay, aiming to secure a bridgehead, targeting supply facilities for the land forces. At the same time, large bombers and naval mobile unit torpedo planes and dive bombers from Morotai have launched simultaneous attacks on Japanese air bases to carry out diversionary maneuvers. Recently, they have further expanded and strengthened the air bases at Tacloban, Talac, Burauen, and San Pablo on Leyte Island, and established new airfields, deploying air power forward from Morotai to secure their control advantage. However, these efforts have also been unable to withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. Therefore, they have been successively gathering aircraft carriers at the Leyte base, hoping to seize the opportunity to reverse the situation. A fierce air battle between the Japanese and American air forces is about to unfold.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army launched a general offensive against the US 24th Division and 32nd Division in the Binamo-bean and Manakasenas areas of Leyte Island, by the 22nd, its powerful units had occupied Caracjan and advanced to Carigara Bay. Other units had also attacked from the Capoocan area to the coast of Carigara Bay, completely cutting off the US 32nd Division's land rear transportation route. The US forces, which have been forced to retreat north of Limon, have been weakened by the continuous fierce attacks of the newly reinforced elite Japanese units. However, they are still gathering their forces in preparation for a final stand.</p>

Since Binyang is the largest stronghold defending the Nanning area, the fall of Binyang makes Nanning indefensible.</p>
<h3>The People Must Be Secure First, Then the Nation Will Be Governed and Self-Reliant: Address by Acting Chairman Chen</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - The full text of Acting Chairman Chen's address at the National Military and Political Conference is as follows:</p>
<p>Carrying Out the Legacy, Striving Forward</p>
<p>Dear everyone, we have encountered great misfortune, that is, our leader, Mr. Wang, who abandoned us midway when his cause was about to be accomplished. I know that the people of the whole country and all of you officials are as sorrowful and mournful as I am. However, at this time of national difficulty, we cannot comfort Mr. Wang's spirit in heaven by simply mourning and grieving. We must all shoulder our responsibilities and carry out his legacy in order to complete Mr. Wang's unfinished aspirations. Therefore, we are holding this conference of national military and political leaders while you are here in Nanjing to attend the funeral.</p>
<p>I issued a policy statement on the 20th of this month, opening with two sentences, "All policies determined by the late Chairman are the policies that Gongbo will carry out; all facilities established by the late Chairman are the facilities that Gongbo will establish today." This is to express that I do not want to innovate or set new policies. Because the National Government's policy was determined as early as when the capital was returned in 1940, and the remaining facilities have been promulgated successively for more than four years. What we lack today is not theory, not policy, but perseverance and determination. Policies that were set in the past may not have been implemented due to objective obstacles or subjective intent. In the future, we must strive to remove obstacles and firmly resolve to take on the responsibility of completing Mr. Wang's unfinished business. This is what I listed in several points on the 20th of this month: first, to cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War; second, to promote unity and peace; third, to purify officialdom; fourth, to continue production; and fifth, to establish security. These are not new policies that I have set, but policies that were set years ago, as far back as 1924. For example, opposition to imperialism was determined as early as 1924, when the Kuomintang was reorganized. Purifying officialdom was implemented in 1925, when the National Government was established in Guangzhou. As for promoting comprehensive peace, it was the purpose of the National Government's return to the capital. Continuing production and establishing security are necessary requirements for participating in the Greater East Asia War. However, in the past, either because the revolution was interrupted or because the situation changed, some of these were stopped halfway, and some were carried out but have not yet achieved results.</p>
<p>The Responsibility of Protecting China and Revitalizing Asia Is Great</p>
<p>All the items that I have listed must be implemented, and their implementation must be effective. After the death of Mr. Wang, my responsibility and yours have increased. I hope that all of you will be mindful of Mr. Wang's legacy and deeply consider the future of China, strive to implement it, and seek to revive China, without being complacent about our responsibility after death.</p>
<p>Today, at the National Military and Political Conference, I would like to point out two more points to draw your attention. First, no matter what country, if it wants to survive and revive, the most reliable way is to rely on itself, not to depend on others. If we look at history and the present, no matter what country, there is no reason why it can survive by relying on others for eternal help. Taking the Greater East Asia War as an example, the purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to seek the liberation of all the peoples of East Asia. Taking China's participation in the war as an example, it is to seek China's own liberation. But the nation's demand for liberation depends entirely on its own efforts. A country's demand for freedom and independence also depends entirely on its own efforts. I want to tell you that there are many ways to make our own efforts, and the most important point is that since we are a participating country, we have the responsibility of a participating country and should fulfill the obligations of a participating country. The foundation of the government should be built on the people, not outside the people. Because the composition of the country is the people, and the government's duty is to lead the people on the one hand, and to represent the people on the other. If the government is separated from the people, the government will also collapse, and other efforts will be wasted. So I want to tell you, those who are responsible for politics and military affairs should thoroughly understand this. In short, the government must be united with the people, be self-reliant, the people must be secure first, and then the nation will be governed and self-reliant. If we cannot do this, you and I are derelict in our duties and will become criminals of the nation.</p>
<p>Reviewing the Past, Improving the Future</p>
<p>Second, no matter what government, if it wants to strengthen and be self-reliant, the most important thing is to have a spirit of self-reliance. The greatest function of the government is nothing more than two things: one is to mobilize, and the other is to urge. Without these two things, the government cannot survive. However, there can be urging only with mobilization. But how can we mobilize? The most important thing is to review ourselves. There can be improvement only with review. Review is the cause of mobilization, and improvement is the result of mobilization. The purpose of convening this conference is entirely to review the past and improve the future. In the past year, according to my personal review, I feel very dangerous. In terms of politics, discipline is gradually declining, and the government and the people have become separated. In terms of military affairs, training is lax, and the people and the army cannot cooperate. Moreover, under the rule of the National Government, there are not few provinces, but not one county is managed to satisfaction. There are also not few troops, but bandits can be found everywhere. In this situation, can our army still call itself a restorer of China and a protector of East Asia? Therefore, our politics and military affairs should be reviewed again. The succession of institutions, the implementation of systems, the deployment of troops, and the pacification plan all need to be thoroughly improved. I sincerely hope that everyone attending today will express their opinions as much as possible so that our politics and military affairs can reach a decision for renewal.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Wang was buried, and everyone must rise up to complete Mr. Wang's legacy. I hope that everyone will be more firm, more calm, and more diligent, without wavering, without being impulsive, and without being lazy, in order to save the country and secure the people. The central government's established policies, I hope that everyone will work hard to promote them. If you have any difficulties, the central government will be responsible for solving them for you. Today, in this time of national difficulty, we only have different positions and duties, and there is no division between the central government and the local government. Your difficulties are the central government's difficulties, and your success is also the central government's success. It can even be said that the joy of the world is the joy of myself and all of you, and the sorrow of the world is the sorrow of myself and all of you. Today is truly a critical moment of life and death. In this final effort, I hope that you and I will encourage each other.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Mission of the Military and Political Conference</h3>
<p>Taking advantage of the presence of local military and political leaders in Nanjing to attend Chairman Wang's funeral, the central authorities are holding a National Military and Political Conference. This conference has two good opportunities in objective terms: First, the participation of local military and political leaders in Chairman Wang's funeral is not simply a matter of etiquette but mainly to promote a common determination to carry out Chairman Wang's legacy. Second, it is difficult for military and political leaders from all over the country to gather together, and this time they have all come from afar. Therefore, we believe that the central authorities will gain more by seizing these two opportunities to hold the conference than by convening a specialized plenary conference.</p>
<p>The expectations for this conference have been made very clear and concise in the addresses of Acting Chairman Chen and Vice President Zhou. We also believe that the military and political officials in various regions, who bear the heavy responsibility entrusted by the country, will be able to appreciate the intentions of the authorities and do their best in their respective positions. We would like to briefly discuss our feelings as follows:</p>
<p>(1) We hope that everyone will tell the truth and honestly review the past. Acting Chairman Chen said, "There can be improvement only with review." By reviewing the weaknesses and shortcomings of the past, we can use them as a basis for improvement. Therefore, the review must be honest and truthful. There is nothing shameful in the past's shortcomings, as long as we earnestly improve them in the future. The ancients said, "It is not admirable to have no faults, but it is admirable to correct them; it is not worrying to have no faults, but it is worrying to cover them up." If we are unwilling to honestly review our own shortcomings and insist on covering them up, there is no possibility of improvement. Not only will we bury our own future, but the future of the country will also be buried.</p>
<p>(2) We hope that everyone will develop self-esteem and abandon the bad habit of relying on and shirking responsibility. Acting Chairman Chen also said, "No matter what country, if it wants to survive and revive, the most reliable way is to rely on itself, not to depend on others." This clearly shows us that reliance is unreliable. Those who rely on others generally lack self-esteem. The survival of an individual is dangerous if it depends on others, and the survival of a country cannot be based on reliance. We oppose the Chongqing regime's complete dependence on Britain and the United States, which shows no self-esteem. On the other hand, although the National Government has an alliance with Japan, it cannot have a dependent mentality. Because after reliance, not only will self-esteem be destroyed, but the burden on others will also be increased. Therefore, not only should the government and officials be self-reliant and set an example, but also the people should be encouraged to be self-reliant.</p>
<p>(3) We hope to gradually achieve the establishment of security. The security situation in various parts of the peace zone is currently too dangerous. As Acting Chairman Chen said, "There are not few troops, but bandits can be found everywhere." These are indeed poignant words. The country raises troops to protect its borders and secure its people, but now it is more than enough to disturb the people, which is too outrageous. Therefore, a thorough improvement of the military is an urgent task.</p>
<p>(4) We hope to establish public opinion organs. "If the government is separated from the people, the government will also collapse." "The government must be united with the people, be self-reliant, the people must be secure first, and then the nation will be governed and self-reliant." This is what Acting Chairman Chen sincerely pointed out. We have always believed that to communicate public opinion, it is necessary to establish public opinion organs. Although true public opinion organs may not be established for a while, similar public opinion organs must be widely established so that people can gradually develop the habit of participating in politics and truly achieve a government that is united with the people.</p>
<p>Finally, we regard this conference as a conference that will determine the future of the country, and this is not an overstatement. As Allied General Chief of Staff Matsui said, "After the death of Chairman Wang, the future of China depends entirely on this conference." This shows the keen observation and clear understanding of Allied personnel. We hope that after this conference, the various departments of the government will spontaneously invigorate themselves and move towards establishing security and improving politics, and that the people will cooperate with the government to promote its policies. At the same time, we also hope that the local authorities of the Allied nations will value China's national conditions and public sentiment and cooperate to support the Chinese government's policies. We believe that the government's unilateral efforts are not enough and require the cooperation of the people; and that the efforts of both the government and the people are still not enough and require the cooperation of the Allied nations. Only with the consistent cooperation of all three parties can we improve the current situation in China and, at the same time, be conducive to winning the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Obituary of Former Chairman Wang</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Han Ruo</p>
<p>Representatives from Shanghai going to Beijing to respectfully attend the memorial service for Chairman Wang and participate in the funeral procession arrived in Beijing on the 21st and 22nd, respectively. At 4 PM on the 22nd, the delegation, led by Counselor Pan Da, went to the Chairman's coffin to pay respects.</p>
<p>A View of the Auditorium</p>
<p>The National Government building at the Nanming Temple was entirely draped in white mourning cloth. At the main entrance of the National Government, four guard soldiers stood respectfully beneath the Party-State flag, which was lowered to half-mast. Their rifles were adorned with black gauze, and their demeanor was solemn. Inside the entrance, facing forward, was a gun carriage prepared for the transfer of the coffin, upon which was placed a portrait of the Chairman. The coffin was placed in the auditorium of the National Government, with a large portrait of the deceased displayed in front of it. White candles burned high, and the air was filled with a faint fragrance. A military band played mourning music beside the coffin. The office of the funeral committee was located in the room on the left, where numerous staff members were busy recording condolences, memorial banners, and wreaths. Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were specially assigned to receive and escort foreign dignitaries who came to pay their respects. People from all walks of life came in an endless stream to offer their condolences.</p>
<p>The Morning of the Funeral</p>
<p>The funeral ceremony was scheduled to begin at 6:30 AM on the 23rd and conclude after 12:00 PM. The staff of the funeral committee worked tirelessly through the night of the 22nd. Important pallbearers were required to gather at the National Government auditorium before 6:00 AM on the 23rd. Consequently, people were already moving about on Baotai Street, Chengxian Street, and Zhongshan Road around 5:00 AM. Security personnel and the public participating in the funeral procession began preparations around 4:00 AM. The reporter set out for the National Government by horse-drawn carriage around 5:00 AM. Soldiers and police were densely deployed in front of the National Government. Participants in the funeral procession had already lined up along Kaoshi Road to await the ceremony. Military and political leaders, as well as diplomatic envoys, arrived one after another. The transfer of the coffin ceremony began at 6:30 AM and was completed according to the order amid the loud sound of artillery salutes. Immediately following, the coffin was carried out. At this time, the east was just beginning to show a faint white glow, the time was 6:53 AM.</p>
<p>On November 23rd of last year, the Second National Propaganda Conference was held at the Sino-German Cultural Association. The Chairman hosted a tea party for the attending representatives at 4 PM and personally delivered instructions. The reporter attended the meeting and listened to the instructions. Now, it is again November 23rd, exactly one year later. It is said that the Chairman's public meeting with outsiders on that day last year was his last. Thereafter, due to health reasons, he did not receive or grant audiences to personnel on a large scale. Now, at this moment and in this place, this great man of his generation is about to rest eternally in paradise.</p>
<p>A Long Funeral Procession</p>
<p>Around 7:00 AM, the Chairman's flag, draped in black gauze and held by the flag-bearing officer, solemnly and slowly emerged from the main gate of the National Government. Following behind were the adjutant officers, respectfully holding the Chairman's personal medals and military saber on a white tray. Chairman Chen's representative, wearing the new national uniform, stepped out first, his steps steady, his face full of sorrow. The coffin was placed on the gun carriage, covered with the Party-State flag, and drawn by eight horses, moving slowly. The coffin bearers and family members walked on either side. Following them were the various committee members and diplomatic envoys. Other representatives respectfully sent off the coffin, arranged in their designated areas. As the coffin left the main gate of the National Government, everyone present paid their respects. The sky was already bright, and everything was silent, with only the faint sound of footsteps and mourning cries. Even the birds in the trees were silent and bowed their heads, as if expressing sorrow for the hero's spirit.</p>
<p>The funeral procession stretched for over ten miles. Longtime residents of Nanjing said that this was the most solemn and grand funeral since the funeral of President Sun Yat-sen. The procession passed through Zhongshan Gate, taking one hour and thirty-eight minutes. The front of the procession had already reached Plum Blossom Mountain, while looking west from the high point of Zhongshan Gate, the end of the procession was still out of sight, with memorial banners and flags still waving and moving at Xinjiekou.</p>
<p>The public stood along the roadside, continuously for over ten miles. The Japanese flags at the entrances of the residences of Allied nationals in Nanjing were lowered to half-mast to express mourning. Women and children held flags in their hands, respectfully welcoming and sending off the coffin, demonstrating that the Chairman's spirit moved people far and wide.</p>
<p>More Than One Hundred and Fifty Pallbearers</p>
<p>The coffin carriage was pulled by horses to the foot of Plum Blossom Mountain. The section from the foot of the mountain to the tomb entrance was carried up the mountain by special pallbearers. The 157 pallbearers were specially selected in Beijing by the North China Political Affairs Commission. They were pallbearers from the famous Tongsheng Funeral Home in the country. The Political Affairs Commission sent a special commissioner to lead them south to respectfully carry the Chairman's coffin for burial. This group of pallbearers was experienced and known for their stability and appropriateness. It is said that the pallbearers from this funeral home were used for the funerals of Emperor Guangxu and Empress Dowager Cixi, as well as for the burial of President Sun Yat-sen. Sixty-four pallbearers formed a team, divided into two teams to carry the coffin. There were also staff members who tapped rulers to direct them. Each of them was a bald, tall, and burly man, wearing white and blue clothes, with short poles as thick as teacups on their shoulders, chests puffed out and bellies protruding, moving forward with the procession. If you put a feathered hat on their heads, they would look like the muscular deities in a wax temple.</p>
<p>Temporary Resting Place on Plum Blossom Mountain</p>
<p>Plum Blossom Mountain, the temporary burial site, is part of the auxiliary park area. From the foot of the mountain to the tomb entrance, order was maintained by the Youth Corps and the Model Joint Team. Their uniforms were neat. This group of strong and brave youths, personally cultivated by the leader, served the leader for the last time and therefore put in extra effort.</p>
<p>Sixty-four pallbearers wearing green clothes carried the coffin up the mountain, and after reaching the tomb, another twenty-four pallbearers wearing white clothes carried it to the burial pit. The time was 10:17 AM. At 11:00 AM sharp, the burial ceremony was led by Chen Gongbo, the acting Chairman. After the ceremony, around 12:00 PM, the pallbearers slowly carried the coffin into the pit. Madam Wang, with tears in her eyes, tossed the first handful of soil onto the coffin, and the other personnel followed suit. At this point, this epoch-making great man bid farewell forever to his beloved and hard-working subordinates, and passed on the heavy responsibility of reviving China and protecting East Asia to future generations.

<h3>Four Organizations Welcomed and Saw Off Japanese Ambassadors Yesterday, The Atmosphere was Extremely Warm</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the China Press Association, the Citizens Welfare Association, and the China National Diplomacy Promotion Association held a tea party at the Jiahua Club yesterday (the 24th) afternoon at 4 PM to bid farewell to Ambassador Usami and welcome the new Ambassador Tsuchida. The atmosphere was extremely warm. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Guests Present</p>
<p>Ambassador Usami, new Ambassador Tsuchida, Information Minister Matsudaira, and Secretary Nakata arrived on time. The Municipal Government was represented by Secretary-General Wu, Welfare Bureau Chief Zhou Yuying, Finance Bureau Chief Yuan Houzhi, Public Works Bureau Chief Zhang Enlin, Land Administration Bureau Chief Fan Yongzeng, Materials Distribution Director Feng You, etc. Members of the four organizations present included Zhao Jinqing, Pei Yunqing, Gu Nanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, Wu Yunzhai, Xu Jianping, Xu Guanqun, Chen Shao Gui, Huang Jingsu, Lu Guangjie, Zhao Ruguan, Chen Zhongnan, Chen Riping, Shen Siliang, Jin Zongcheng, Shu Ailu, Xu Liqiu, Feng Bingnan, Xie Xiaochu, Song Zhuozai, Yang Guanqi, Jin Guanxian, Niisaka Yoichi, Hidak Kiyomasa, Moriyama Takashi, He Wuliang, Ren Yunpeng, Zhou Mengbai, Wan Xuefang, Cen Zhiliang, Wang Shuxian, Chen Panjun, Zhu Yongkang, Zong Jingze, and over two hundred others, gathered together. They were warmly received by the hosts Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binhe, and others. Wen Lanting delivered the opening remarks, followed by speeches of thanks from Ambassador Usami and new Ambassador Tsuchida. Secretary-General Wu then delivered a speech, expressing many sincere sentiments. Finally, tea and refreshments were served, and the atmosphere of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new was extremely warm. The event lasted for two hours before the hosts and guests happily dispersed.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Wen Lanting said in his speech: "Your Excellency Ambassador Usami, Your Excellency Ambassador Tsuchida, distinguished guests, today, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens Welfare Association, the China Press Association, and the China National Diplomacy Promotion Association are jointly hosting this gathering to bid farewell to His Excellency Ambassador Usami and welcome the newly appointed His Excellency Ambassador Tsuchida. We are very pleased to have you all participate. His Excellency Ambassador Usami assumed his post in Shanghai in April of this year, and we are grateful for his cooperation in various matters over the past seven months. He is now transferring to the Greater East Asia Ministry. Although he is leaving Shanghai, he will still be indirectly related to Shanghai, and we hope to receive his guidance at any time in the future. Ambassador Tsuchida is transferring from North China to the South this time. Although this is our first meeting, we have long admired his political reputation while serving in North China. We will have opportunities to learn from him in the future, and we hope that he will not hesitate to give us guidance. Shanghai is a society where people from all over gather, and the situation is very complex. At the same time, it is the center of economy and culture, and its position is very important. If everything is handled properly, it can contribute to the war effort, promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, and fulfill its responsibility as an important rear base. Especially at this stage when the overall Greater East Asia war situation is gradually becoming tense, Shanghai's position becomes even more important, and the handling of issues becomes even more difficult. Therefore, the Chinese and Japanese authorities who are in charge of Shanghai need even more talent and prudence. Currently, the main issue in Shanghai is how to stabilize people's livelihood. Simply put, if people's livelihood cannot be stabilized, at least it must be stabilized. The desires of the Chinese people are not high. If the minimum standard of living cannot be stabilized, it is difficult to understand how beautiful other issues are said to be. Of course, at this time, we must endure all the pain and strive for victory together, but there is a limit to enduring pain. In other words, unnecessary pain, avoidable pain, pain caused by human negligence, and pain that is not in line with national conditions should not be endured. We hope to do more work to stabilize people's livelihood within this limit, which is indirectly doing Sino-Japanese cooperation work. On April 21st of this year, I said at the welcome meeting for Ambassador Usami: 'I hope that we can treat each other with sincerity and promote the unfinished work of Sino-Japanese cooperation.' Now I still offer these two words to Ambassador Tsuchida. I wish both Ambassadors good health."</p>
<p>Usami's Speech</p>
<p>Ambassador Usami then delivered a speech, saying: "I am truly honored to be bidden farewell by the four organizations in Shanghai today. I am extremely grateful for the cooperation and assistance from all walks of life during my term. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude. Today, the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce. The fate of the entire Greater East Asia rests on this battle. China is one of the participants in the war, and I hope that it can exert its full strength in the future and cooperate with Japan to enhance the alliance between China and Japan, so that Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation will be further strengthened. On the other hand, we can work together to drive out our enemies, Britain and the United States, and achieve the supreme ideal of coexistence and co-prosperity in Greater East Asia. I will soon be leaving my post and returning to the East. Ambassador Tsuchida is now taking on this important task. Ambassador Tsuchida is a person with rich experience and profound knowledge. This time in Shanghai, he can not only guide the local Japanese in various fields, but also represent the Japanese side to cooperate with various circles in Shanghai. I hope that in the future, all sectors can cooperate and cooperate with Ambassador Tsuchida with even more strength than they assisted me, so that Sino-Japanese cooperation can be promoted and we can continue to advance towards the path of securing victory in the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<p>Tsuchida's Speech</p>
<p>Later, Ambassador Tsuchida delivered a speech, saying: "I am very pleased to be welcomed by the powerful organizations in Shanghai today. I stayed in North China in your country for a long time. I know a lot about the situation in Shanghai. I know that Shanghai is an extremely complex city, and it is not easy to solve various problems. Therefore, I hope that you can give me more assistance in the future. Mr. Wen just said that during the war, various pains are inevitable, but unnecessary pains should not be added to the people. I deeply agree with this. As the Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage, China and Japan should make the greatest efforts to move towards the path of certain victory. If this war unfortunately fails, the fate of all East Asia will be very miserable, and hundreds of millions of people in Greater East Asia will have no day to raise their heads. Therefore, we must defeat the British and American enemies to the final victory. China and Japan have had alliance treaties and the Greater East Asia Conference in the past. I hope that in the future, we can work together based on these basic principles, and I hope that the powerful organizations in Shanghai can provide more assistance and cooperation, which would be my honor."</p>
<p>Wu Songgao's Speech</p>
<p>Finally, Secretary-General Wu delivered a speech, expressing his deep gratitude for Ambassador Usami's cooperation during his time in Shanghai. In the past, the municipal government's policy focused on cooperating in the war and stabilizing people's livelihood, and this will continue in the future. Only by cooperating in the war and stabilizing people's livelihood can we achieve final victory as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Revised Timetable, Trams Resume Operation, Temporarily Running Twice in the Morning and Evening</h3>
<p>Since the adjustment of tram services in the city some days ago, many citizens have not understood the running times and the temporarily canceled stops, resulting in long waits for trams and great inconvenience. In particular, the prices of rickshaws and pedicabs have taken the opportunity to rise, causing great inconvenience to office workers who commute back and forth. The reporter visited the person in charge of the Shanghai Urban Transportation Company about this, who said that the company is constantly striving to restore the operation of all vehicles to maintain traffic, but in order to save electricity, it will temporarily resume the operation of lines 1, 2, 7, and 8, the four main lines, with running times from 6:30 AM to 8:30 AM every morning and from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day. The temporarily proposed canceled stops on the above four main lines include: Line 1 in front of the First National School, Hainin Road Sichuan Road Bridge; Line 2 Changde Road Jing'an Temple Road (not Jing'an Temple), Huanghe Road, Zhejiang Road; Line 7 Yongding Road; Line 8 Xuchang Road, Fish Market. As for trolleybuses, they will be restored as soon as the electricity supply increases. (Another report) In order to maintain traffic, the French Tram Company has specially resumed the operation of Line 4 trams from the Bund to Shanzhong Road from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day. As for buses, they will continue to operate as usual.</p>
<h3>Rice-Producing Area Inspection Group Leaves for Suzhou This Morning</h3>
<p>The city's press reporters' rice-producing area inspection group departed today. Yesterday (the 24th), they went to the city's Rice and Grain Control Association, the Military Police Headquarters, the Japanese Embassy, the City Propaganda Office and other relevant agencies. At 9:30 AM, they went to the Rice and Grain Control Association at the Racecourse, where they were personally received by Chen Guoquan, the chairman of the association, and Gui Tian, the vice chairman. The two committee members expressed their respect for the reporter group's trip on the spot and hoped to introduce the situation of rice purchase in various regions more. Then, they visited the Military Police Team and were received by Captain Nanzawa. At 11:00, they went to the Headquarters and were received by Staff Officer Inoue. Staff Officer Inoue gave many instructions to the reporter's inspection group. At 12:00 noon, they were treated to a simple meal by the Rice and Grain Control Association. In the afternoon, they arrived at the City Propaganda Office and were received by Director Liang. The group will take a car to Suzhou at 8:00 this morning (the 25th).</p>
<h3>Seventeen Illegal Rice Merchants Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>Since the enemy's American air force attacked Shanghai on the 11th of this month, some illegal rice merchants have been creating rumors and attempting to make huge profits, resulting in skyrocketing black market rice prices. In order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the Economic Security Division of the City Police Bureau conducted a thorough investigation and arrested more than a hundred rice merchants. After investigation and trial, seventeen rice merchants, whose circumstances were serious and who had indeed raised rice prices arbitrarily, have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law. Dozens of others are still under investigation by the economic police branch, and they will be punished separately depending on the severity of the case.</p>
<h3>Unregistered Private Schools Also Entitled to Special Rice Allocation</h3>
<p>According to a statement from the Municipal Education Bureau, the Ministry of Education has long promulgated regulations on the registration of private schools, which clearly stipulate that schools must comply with the regulations if they want to obtain legal status. As for the special rice allocation for teachers and staff in the city this time, the Education Bureau is acting on the will of the mayor and consulting with the Materials Allocation Office in order to reduce the burden on the personnel of various schools. In addition to municipal and registered private schools, most unregistered private schools are also entitled to the same rights after completing the required procedures. Therefore, the registration of private schools and rice allocation are two separate matters and should not be confused.</p>
<h3>Economic Security Division Arrests Large Number of Oil and Candle Profiteers Taking Advantage of Air Raids to Raise Prices</h3>
<p>The Economic Security Division recently issued a statement regarding the detention of profiteers who took advantage of the enemy's air raids to raise prices: "When the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked on the 21st of this month, some power lines in the city were damaged, and the general public was worried about power outages, so they rushed to buy oil lamps, oils, candles and other lighting materials for use. However, some profiteers believed that huge profits could be made, so they disregarded the difficulties of the public and took the opportunity to raise prices, manipulate and hoard goods, and destroy the economy. This is the worst thing. In view of this, our office has detained and strictly dealt with these profiteers one by one. At the same time, the industry associations such as the cigarette, match, soap and candle industry associations, and the edible oil industry association have been found to have instigated members to raise prices, so the persons in charge of the two associations have been summoned for restriction and strict investigation. If the charges are true, they will be severely punished. In the future, in the event of emergencies, anyone who hoards or disrupts the supply of materials or manipulates prices, regardless of who they are, will be immediately arrested. The persons in charge of all industry associations should strictly supervise their members and strictly prohibit members from raising prices privately without the approval of the Economic Bureau. If profiteers who take the opportunity to hoard goods are found, each industry association must bear some responsibility, so each association should instruct its members to strictly abide by this order to avoid being implicated. Recently, enemy planes have been attacking from time to time. Citizens of this city should take precautions against the emergency situation caused by air raids, maintain calm in an emergency, and obey the instructions of the authorities. If profiteers who take the opportunity to hoard goods or refuse to sell their stored goods are found, they should be reported immediately to the nearest economic police team for arrest. The number of profiteers arrested this time is as high as sixty-eight. Our office will intensify this investigation in the future and will never be lenient. The office will not only focus on oil and candles, but also on profiteers who hoard other food, daily necessities, and so on. Once discovered, no matter what the circumstances, they will all be detained and severely punished."</p>

<h3>Special Tax in Old District One Suddenly Increased by 80 Million Yuan, Director Chen of the Special Tax Office Issues Statement</h3>
<p>The 29th regular press conference convened by the City Propaganda Office was held at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 24th) in the City Government conference room on Jiangxi Road. Chen Junde, Director of the Special Tax Office of the Finance Bureau, attended the meeting and issued the following statement in response to the various questions raised by reporters: "The office was reorganized on September 16th of this year, and it now has four sections: administrative affairs, collection, investigation, and auditing, as well as accounting. Loyal and capable personnel have been carefully selected to serve as section chiefs and directors. In the past two months, in addition to formulating employee incentive rules and methods for handling lien stores, all dispatched investigators have been required to carry an action permit signed by me personally, which states the employee's name, service location, time, and is cancelled immediately after the work is completed, in order to prevent abuse. We have also leased P.O. Box 275 at the General Post Office as a public notice box. If there are any instances of misconduct by our office's employees or stores taking advantage of tax evasion, the public is welcome to report them truthfully for investigation. Businesses and the public are also welcome to submit opinions on improving tax affairs to the mailbox, which will be adopted. The office is currently printing a special tax payment certificate, which will change color paper once a month. Once the tax collected by the store is paid, a special tax payment certificate for the month will be issued and required to be pasted on the shop window for identification.</p>
<p>As for tax revenue, since the sharp reorganization, the total increase has reached 80 million yuan, calculated only for the old District One. If no special accidents occur in the future, then tax revenue can be expected to continue to increase."</p>

<h3>Air Defense Headquarters Urges Citizens to Pay Attention to Air Raid Shelters to Reduce Air Raid Casualties</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Civil Air Defense Headquarters recently issued the following statement: "The Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage. The Japanese army is fighting a bloody battle with the American army in the Philippines, and in China, they are directly cutting across the southwest corner, eventually trapping the American air force in Kunming and leaving them at a loss. Britain and the United States instigated Chongqing to bear the brunt, and their air force in China and the main force in Chongqing were jointly subjected to a major threat from the Japanese army. The enemy desperately attacked in the Pacific, attempting to cut off the Japanese army's rear lines of communication and air raid the Japanese mainland, but it was all a flash in the pan and ultimately came to naught. However, the remaining American air force units in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places are still hoping to use psychological warfare to publicize and agitate, and have been making restless moves. They invaded Shanghai, the peaceful center, on November 11th and 21st of this year, and carried out indiscriminate bombings. Regardless of the purpose of the American air force's arrival in Shanghai, we have witnessed the enemy planes being attacked and have gained valuable experience that requires correction in promoting civil air defense work. We are now publishing it to the public for future reference, so as to establish a civil air defense posture.</p>
<p>Evacuate Immediately When an Air Raid Begins</p>
<p>(1) Although the damage reports of the air raids on the 11th and 21st were extremely minor, it is regrettable that there were casualties. In addition to those who died heroically in the course of air defense, the majority of the casualties were not caused by bombs, but by enemy planes' machine gun bullets or stray bullets during air combat between the two sides. This shows that the public has not fully recognized the danger of air raids, and some are even driven by curiosity to risk watching, which is actually caused by incomplete training. The air defense authorities have been working hard to explain this in the guidance outline for evacuation that is being implemented. Whenever one sees the shadow of a plane, hears the sound of a plane, or sees an air raid begin, one must quickly evacuate. Moreover, if an enemy plane drops a bomb in the upper atmosphere, the launch point and the landing point are far apart even when measured on the ground. Therefore, it goes without saying that one should evacuate immediately when one sees or hears an enemy plane after the air raid warning is issued. If one can immediately and automatically evacuate as soon as one learns that air combat has begun within Shanghai, then no one will suffer unnecessary disasters.</p>
<p>Factories Must Build Evacuation Facilities</p>
<p>(2) Taking a practical example, in a certain area of this city, although a certain place was hit by a bomb, almost no one was injured or killed. This is because a quick-witted air defense instructor guided all the personnel to properly evacuate to the pre-set trenches, which resulted in this good result. We are even more convinced of the importance of evacuation facilities and the effectiveness of taking appropriate measures. The composure of workers during air raids is an absolute necessity to ensure production. Each factory must first build complete evacuation facilities that can accommodate all employees, and must also take orderly training, and obey the command when the order is given. In addition, general families or other groups that can accommodate a large number of people must also actively build evacuation facilities. Baojia and others should use appropriate open spaces to encourage the construction of public evacuation shelters. Underground evacuation trenches are more ideal than above-ground evacuation trenches. Uncovered evacuation trenches are dangerous due to falling objects from the sky, so covered ones are better. In addition, buildings that have not yet been designated as public shelters should cooperate to accommodate evacuees on the road so that each is in accordance with reality." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Japanese Fleet Press Department Screens Naval Battle Film</h3>
<p>The Press Department of the Allied Japanese Fleet stationed in China, in order to introduce the recent victory in the naval battle of the Philippines and the outstanding achievements of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force, specially screened the newsreel "The Great Naval Battle of the Philippines" at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (the 24th) in the screening room on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road, inviting relevant parties from the Chinese, Japanese, and foreign press in this city. Before 2:00 p.m., the screening room on the eighth floor was packed. First, Lieutenant Shioda reported on the order of the films to be screened, and then Director Matsushima of the Press Department explained in detail the situation of the battle in the Philippines and the Japanese army's achievements in annihilating the enemy, and introduced the contents of the newsreel. Then the screening of "The Great Naval Battle of the Philippines" began. The Japanese army's bravery in destroying the enemy, shooting down enemy planes, and the Kamikaze Special Attack Force's heroic departure and fierce bombing of enemy ships were all shown on the screen, ending at 4:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Matsushima's Speech</p>
<p>Director Matsushima of the Fleet Press Department delivered a speech while hosting the screening of the newsreel "The Great Naval Battle of the Philippines" for relevant parties from the Chinese, Japanese, and foreign press, stating briefly: "I am deeply grateful for your willingness to take time out of your busy schedules to attend today. Since October 10th of this year, the Japanese army and navy have inflicted serious and profound blows on the enemy American army in the waters of Taiwan, the Philippines, and the East Sea. However, the enemy has vaguely published the results of this operation, concealing the defeat. However, there are still some ignorant people in Shanghai who mistakenly believe in the enemy's American lies. Now, no matter how the enemy propagandizes, Japan has reached the stage of complete victory. We are in the process of annihilating the enemy's remaining mobile units. The enemy Americans suffered heavy losses in this battle, regardless of aircraft carriers or other types of ships. Moreover, the Japanese army has control of the sea and air in the Philippines, and has launched a full-scale annihilation war against the enemy. Therefore, the enemy's attempt on Leyte Gulf will be completely crushed, and the Japanese army will be able to fully achieve it. Recently, when the enemy troops discover the Japanese army, they flee in disarray. Today, we are showing the truth of this battle to you, and in the future, we will continue to show films about the war situation in stages."</p>
