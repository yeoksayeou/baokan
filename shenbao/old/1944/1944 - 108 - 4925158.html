<p>社評</p>
<h3>把握革新政治的時機</h3>
<p>國民政府自從還都以後，已逾四年，我們試加檢討中央政治的過去實況，不必諱言的，存在着多種病症。分析言之：</p>
<p>政治制度，幷未完善。最顯着者，尚未建立民意機關。中央政府未有民意機關，以致地方政府未能單獨建立民意機關。</p>
<p>政洽機構，過於龐大，側重形式，未願實際工作。爲一時環境設立機構，未加統盤考慮，駢枝太多，就政治效率言，等於虛設。</p>
<p>人事不健全，引用官吏，幷未採取人才主義，不能完成專家政治。而抱具親屬，同鄉，黨派觀念，不免流於任用私人的惡習。最皺著的實例，如最近發生的后胡案件，及整個糧食部的舞弊案件。</p>
<p>行政效率不彰，其主要原因在於駢枝機關的重牀疊架，冗員充塞，而公務員的薪給太低，生活不能安定，很難期待努力從公。</p>
<p>對於時局的趨向，無堅定信念，大牽存着五日兆的心理。因此不能脚踏實地爲人民解除戰時不必耍的痛苦。不能使和平區內政治導入正軌。尤其再參戰以後，幷未能發揮實際上的力量。</p>
<p>個人如果發生了病症，當然需要診斷正確，施以對症藥右，尤須從速醫治，不使蔓延和加深。國家政治如果發生了病症，關係於整個國脈的興替，比較個人重要萬倍，絕對需要診斷正確以後，立即醫治。我們不辭借著代謀，對於過去中央政治的病症，作如上面的診斷，就須針對症狀，施以適切醫治。同時，我們認爲目前的病況，已屆複雜嚴重的地步，實在等不及遲徊瞻顧的猶豫。諺云「急驚風確着慢郞中」，不能迅速醫治，這是很危險的。其次，病症診斷後必須施用手術者，切勿猶豫，遲恐滋蔓。譬如貪污等於瘤贅，必須施割，就須以快刀斬亂麻的決心肅淸貪污。一方面需要注射補劑，培補元氣，增强抵抗本能。醫如引用新人才，打破黨派成見，革除親屬同鄉觀念。</p>
<p>中央政治需要革新，旣然非常迫切。而國府汪主席旣在養病期中，暫時不能親理中樞國政，分由陳公博周佛海兩先生主持，那末，應即負起全責，推進革新。陳周兩氏是中樞的政治傑處人才，有學識，有卓見，有經驗，有熱情。我們相信對於過去中央政治上的病症，極爲明瞭。更就陳周兩氏的職位而言，正是爲國家立功的最好時機，必須把握目前革新政治的最好時機。希望即下決心，爲整個國家前途，爲整個民生改善，爲整個大東亞興廢着想，不再顧慮內在環境的牽掣，對於不會理的政治病態，採納盟邦及人民輿情，從速加以革新。我們並建議。</p>
<p>從速建立中央民意機關，並督飭地方建立民意機關，溝通民意，與民更始。</p>
<p>肅淸貪污，全面厲行。獎懲賞罰，注重嚴明。自從后胡槍決以後，全案內情應從速公布，以告國入，使貪污斂跡。一方面，整埋稅收，修正包稅制度，或合理的增加稅收，使財政充實。特別是充分增加公務員俸給，使之安定生活，減少貪污動機，增進行政效率。</p>
<p>不合戰時體制之駢枝機關及閑散冗員，從速合併或裁撤。</p>
<p>整理地方行政，確立治安，以安定民生。</p>
<p>今天本報特載日本朝日新聞社評，「期望國府肅淸政治」，盟邦輿論熱情洋溢，期待我國政治革新，不勝同感，爰就觀感，論列如上。國府汪主席東渡養病，爲時逾月，我們居於人民立塲，急迫地要求政府公布革新政治的計劃，以及實施的成績，以慰喁喁之望。</p>
<p>譯評</p>
<h3>期望國府肅淸政治</h3>
<p>今日的中國，須實行增強生產，已無容　述。即如物價問題，現已不能單已經濟問題來解決。而成為極深刻的政治問題，所以各方面都竭力希望能先行革新政治。譬如一般官污使農民的血榨取農民，無故壓迫盜民，結果不但使農民的血汗付諸東流，並且此種增產對於國家亳無利益，使貪官污吏從肥私裏而已。所以增產的先決問題乃在根絕貪官污吏，而政府在通知物資與統治人民之前，必須先行統制官吏。折來關於此種呼聲漸次高漲，不是無因的。</p>
<p>國民政府此次槍決穩食部的官吏數名，確是肅淸政治的先聲，使風氣煥然一新。但是，這次的肅正行爲，假使視袛虎頭蛇尾，不澈底而終，則決不能達到全國國民的期望，所以我們希盟國府能澈底實行預期的政策。國民政府是包含各黨各派和無黨無派，肅正政治假如缺乏澈底決心，專於偏電一黨一派，則甲派專指乙派爲貪官污吏，互施攻擊，以致國內各派之爭，依舊不能消滅，仍將繼續鬥爭。如是長此以往，爲强化政治力的刷新，反引起政治力的分裂，對於國府的自强工作，反將招致無數的相反的後果。</p>
<p>我們希望肅正能够積極果斷，並且事不容緩，不能再益此產區。譬如就物價問題來設，假如待物發缺乏以後，再來肅正貪官和奸商，則爲時已晚，物炎依舊不能入手。</p>
<p>我們這裹不忌煩複，再三陳言：官吏態該至減一貫，空乏己身，貢獻於行政之運營。聯締國積投機的當局自身，假如有光行囤積投機的行爲，其罪實該萬死。毛主席所謂國家之逆戰也者，就是此　會官污吏。我們切實期認國府諸公，對於此等國內的敵人，能够予以積極果敢的處置。（華星：　自三目十七日西部朝新開）</p>
<h3>日空軍活躍印境擊落敵機四一架　並粉碎巴列爾敵機場設施</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日大本營二十日下午四時四十分發表：面甸方面日軍航空部隊，增於四月時期日在伊姆發爾盆地上空擊落敵機四十一架，內三架來證實。同時，並轟炸巴列爾敵燒塲，將其附屬設施粉碎，日機五架尚未飛還。　　東京二十日中央社電　緬甸方面日陸軍航空部隊，連日來協力印度進攻作戰，並轟炸在加蔭附近地區降下刻行麥動中之敵空軍挺身隊，現已將敵增强主力之企圖完全粉碎，復在伊姆法雨盆地內縱橫活躍。十七日戰鬥機隊於伊姆法爾盆地上空，協力陸上部隊猛攻梅期（伊姆法爾盆地南方要衡），是日夕刻於比先波爾上空攻擊敵戰鬥轟炸機聯合大編隊，日機當結成一體，突入敵機羣，即展開壯烈空戰，是役，擊落敵噴火式敵機二十五架，P51型機十架，A35型機六架（內三架未證實），共計四十一架又有戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊，亦與此相前後　擊巴列爾敵樣塲，排除敵戰鬥機之頑强抵抗，全彈命中該敵機塲之附屬設施，將之澈底粉碎。日機於比先波爾空戰中及巴列爾一役，亦有戰鬥機三架未飛還，但日機擊落敵機四十一架，足以反映伊姆法爾攻防戰之一斑。自十八日起協力敵陸上部隊反攻之敵機數頓形減少，復因空中補給欠圓消，敵抵抗力亦形激減，日各進攻部隊正續行急進中。</p>
<h3>日印盟軍佔領　勒馬貢河谷　先拿姆敵軍有後撤勢</h3>

<p>印緬戰綫日軍基地二十日中央社電　日印軍精銳十四日對巴列爾前方要塞之顛拿巴爾進行猛烈攻擊，奪得敵陣地與高地，因之第一綫之據點已全入日軍之手，殘敵現雖頑抗，但該地戰局大勢已決定矣。敵軍自十八日以來，已於該地後方四公里之薩巴姆先拿姆陣地有逐漸退却之勢，顛拿巴爾背後之先拿姆要塞，受日軍猛烈砲擊，十八日該地之彈藥庫，燃料庫皆中彈爆火，運燒四天，極爲凄慘，敵第二十師主力遂呈動搖矣。</p>
<h3>襲拉巴爾等島　敵機受挫</h3>
<p>拉巴爾等島敵機受挫拉巴爾二十日中央社電拉巴爾方面，十八日書間曾有敵戰鬥轟炸機先後約五百架來襲，日軍擊落其三架，日方損害較微。又波根維兩島布英方面，十八日畫聞曾有敵戰鬥機十二架來襲，當被日軍擊落一架，日方毫無損害。又鄰接波根維爾島之布加島方面，十八日書間曾有敵戰鬥機轟炸機二十二架來襲，日軍擊落其三架，日方亳無損害。</p>

<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據此間官方宜稱，德。洪聯軍，日昨向喀爾巴阡山脈及轟斯德河上游前進，再獲拓展，敵軍頑强但被驅後退，聯軍佔領多處，而敵之反攻無效，泰諾波爾之西南，敵步兵及坦克車發動絕大之攻勢而失敗。</p>

<h3>完成獨立在此一戰　陳公博氏致鮑斯主席書</h3>
<p>自由印度區時政府領袖飽斯閣下：余接獲印度前綫之遠大消息，閣下領導自由印度國民軍，與友邦日本軍協力下，突入印度境內，着　應嫂得勝利。余於感奮之餘，謹以滿腔熟減，祝祖國民軍之搜報，並祈自由印度獨立運動之成功；同時，並擬於此略述我國革命志士及革命民衆，對目前時局所懷之見解。　　三種決定要素</p>
<p>此次戰爭，狹義的看來，係對英美兩頭或英美人之戰爭，但實際上更慶義的說來，係民族共存中義對國際侵略主義之戰爭。戰爭之目的，並不敵視一國一民族，乃粉碎國際侵略主義舊秩序之束轉，掃蕩一切復仇殘害之心理，使不再流毒於世界。戰爭之決定要素有三：其一，侵略主義者相互問之利害衝突；其二，被壓迫民族獨立生存之革命的要求；其三，世界人類之共存共榮主義的自覺。東亞民族之聯袂而起，共同奮鬥者，決非偶然，而盟邦日本之毅然　起，援助中國，援助印度細的，援助東亞民族，爲保衛東亞之前驅者，亦非偶然。吾人可斷言此乃歷中發展之必然的結束。</p>
<p>要覆滅國際侵略主義之舊秩序，先須打倒二三百年在此舊秋序中營巢給東之惡魔，更不能不防遇乘機蠢動之兇從。縱於現時，在背後暗中活躍操縱之主犯，實係此兇從英美。敵對英美之意表，即在於此，欲完成此目的，則擊減英帝國主義姿肆侵略之最大根據，保衛太平洋，妨害美國侵略主義之橫行跋扈，實爲其必經過程。</p>
<p>如從此觀點出發，則印度之解放，不僅恢復印度一民族之聯立自由，且影饗於中國的獨立自由之完成者亦極大。實東亞民族存亡安危之所緊。</p>
<p>中印解放的不可分性</p>
<p>中國革命垂六十年，雖幾經磋跌而復起，而迄未成功者，實因過去之渾動其範疇僅限於一次之革命，歷史之發展證明此種革命爲不可能者。中印兩大民族革命之聯繫，中國革命，印度革命與東亞解放之不可分性之意義，全在於此。大東亞戰爭勃發以後，此意義更爲明確。由於戰勝大東亞戰爭，中印之大民族革命始能前進一步。祇在大東亞戰爭之必勝條件下，中印二大民族獨立生存之要求，始能實現。</p>
<p>於此，吾人自身祇有不斷努力，並深謝盟邦之誠意援助，且促進東亞民族之團結，正確認識對東亞應分担之資職。</p>
<p>最堪痛心者，時至今日，我國內尚有一部份人士忘却國父孫中山先生之大亞洲主義遺訓，忘却我國革命對貴國革命所致之期待，並又忘却貴國革命所給與我國之情總神上的共鳴。　　我人不但未予實力援助，以解放貴國之獨立，反有人輔助侵絡者阻害之，此實可稱爲中國民族之恥辱。但余敢於此毅然奉告閣下，我國革命志士與革命民衆，不能再容認中國革命上遺有此種污點之恥等。大東而戰爭決勝階段中，盟邦日本之英雄的勝利，與印度國民單之順利進展的實踐，不能不盟盟爲對此種份子之最後警告。吾吾人確信革命的中國爲統一而奮起，幫舉國一致之總力，繼自由印度與盟邦日本之後，立淤同一戰錢，同生共死，爲自己的祖　，爲共同的東亞，與吾人之共同敵人展開死戰。</p>
<p>閣下此次揭藥此大義，執起救亡祖國之武器，用兵神速，貴國民衆意志愈固，慕敵爲之褶伏，自由印度獨立之完或，即在目前。呻吟於暴敵鐵蹄下之廣多民衆，將獲絕大安慰。中國革命之統一，東亞解放之完成，費繫於閣下之成功。謹以此祝閣下政躬康泰，並自由印度國運隆盛，東亞解放前途光明。（翔；譯自四月十一日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>棉布配給與　兒童服裝問題</h3>
<p>— 吳徵</p>
<p>棉布配給的實施期將近了，對這之前，我倒有一個小小的建議。</p>
<p>目前，滬上差不多沒有一所學校裏的學生是穿有校服的，推其原由，當然是布價貴及不料　得之故。但是我以爲校服的購備無論對於學生才身或學校當局，都是相當需要的事，我國兒童所以不及外國兒童的活潑與好動、乃受着服裝上的牽制也是不用否認的。因此，現在很可以乘這棉布配給的時棧，來想一個辦法。使未來的國家主人翁，不因穿着長袍大掛，而致行動呆滯，精神不振，影饗了康健與其工作效率。</p>
<p>爲簡明計，茲舉辦法五項列後：</p>
<p>各學生按所定價錢，連同購布證呈繳各該學校黨局。</p>
<p>學校當局得盡逮將所集貨款，購布證，具備申請書（購布證與貨款數目可詳列此信內），送交棉布聯營處。</p>
<p>聯營處按各校需布之數量，各配以一色之布疋（以質堅之粗布最佳）</p>
<p>各校得配給布後，即自定式樣：（可以靑少年團之式樣爲表範，顏色不合者，製中山裝上衣，西式短擁頗佳。）一體裁製，同時將工資平均分派後週知各生。　　　各學生以學校當局所示應出之工資，向學校換取調服。</p>
<p>此舉學校當局須完全蓋義務勵行，因爲這本是禪益學校的事，像這次敎育局球鞋的配給，就有夢校竟藉此而圖漁利，罪莫大焉！工資賬自更須完全公開。</p>
<p>這建議想是全滬大中小學校都樂於饗應的吧，雖然，我說的辦法很簡單，惟望商統會及棉布聯營處能予以協助。我確信也是不難做到的事，至於學生之家長，一樣的棒子女添製衣服，當不會在形式上計較而不謮同吧！</p>
<p>那末，不久我們就可見到可年學生們的精神更是煥發奮勇了！</p>

<h3>不落的要塞——拉巴爾</h3>
<p>自入三月以來，南太平洋　綫　然關示緊張，決戰的時機已在眼睫了。日精說部隊以波根維爾島南端布恩為中心，在該島各地隱忍凡數月，摩肩擬掌，正得戰鬥的來臨’這至二一月上旬，即對敵及攻的根據地特洛基納開始猛烈的反攻，日軍逐漸控制敵方飛機塲及各項設施，敵軍也動員了大規模的空軍，或以地上火器，拼命的防戰這。職局的演進，雖末許逆料，然而以反攻特洛基那為契機，敵空軍大舉空賽日軍要衛拉巴爾及加比恩格等址，戰綫已全面的趨於激烈化。敵軍對拉巴爾的反攻自本年初春以來，愈形猛烈，連日有二百架及至三百數十架，一天來犯爾三次，但敵軍覺察了日軍的最大要衝難以攻擊，而且轟炸時，每有莫大犧性，即於一月下旬企圖攪亂或載斷拉巴爾的接濟綫，妄然使激動部隊出現於中部太平洋，侵襲特魯克島及狄尼安，塞班島，然此方面的臼軍防禦極其嚴固，敵空軍遭受日海軍的痛擊，便再轉向方針，運日以一百數十架或二百架來製拉巴爾，尤其是最近，不僅轟炸車事設施，實行卑劣行為對市街亦加轟炸，相繼在波根維爾島西部特洛基那，新不列顛島西南部馬加期·西北部索爾大，新愛關島南東方洋上綠島登陸，敵軍一部份兵力並於二月底在新不列顛島北方洋上阿杜米拉里第羣島的一角登陸，將採取包圍拉巴爾的陣勢，這些敵軍均與日軍在展開着激戰。</p>
<h3>屹然不動的拉巴爾要塞</h3>
<p>敵軍之企圖顯示予拉巴爾以孤立化，並以連續的轟炸，不假日方以反攻的時日。惟日軍絕不屈服，以寡勢的空軍兵力邀擊敵軍，一方地上部隊亦吐出悽烈的火焰，連日獲得戰果。現在拉巴爾的周圍不僅成為一大要塞化，並完全整備着決戰態勢。前已構棄强靱不拔的機械化陣地，並佈置陸海空各兵力，此外以完備的格納法，蓄積着充分可以維持若千年用的兵器彈　，燃料和食糧。又自去年底以還，非戰門部的民間商店公司等實行遷移內地，而對第三國人〇大部份爲中國人）及土民的商業機關，或蔬菜靑果以當地自給爲目的農之聲及椰子園等，均由日軍某部隊接收管理。抺消民問色彩，以軍單一色彩，整飭決戰陣勢。無論轟炸怎樣厲害，日軍有着完備的防空設施。（如對空砲火之設旅完備以外，防空壕有地中式水泥壕，或有利用山　的孔洞壕，空襲除一部份的家宅坍壞而外，其夢害不足為道。尤其是人命的被害可說殆無。）因此日軍的土氣愈益旺盛，袛在等着反攻的機會耳。</p>
<h3>南綫亟待多運飛機</h3>
<p>何謂反攻的機會？則是日方空軍地强的時候。向前綫運飛機去，這種要求是至上的命令，航空擊　戰，爲南太平洋戰綫的特徵，所以可說一切　在制空權的有否。並由航空機的數量而左右。該地戰綫因彼我航空基地在亙相的轟炸圈內，所以制空權可以說砥是控制飛翔的時間而已。而控制飛翔的時問是由飛機數量而決定的。優秀的我飛機與有超羣的戰鬥技術和不屈的戰鬥精神的勇敢無雙日航空兵，臨到敵軍來犯時，立刻展開機翼，由基地起飛予以邀擊，每次一架可以擊斃敵機數架，然而來襲敵機，因其數量勝我十倍或二十倍，即使怎樣惡劣的美機，也不得不讓其一部份侵入日軍上空。雖然敵軍對於百軍的勇猛莫不驚懼，常常把炸彈投入中遁逃，或藉口「天氣不佳」，常常由中途折返，由這看來亦可知道敵軍戰鬥精神的技倆程度。</p>
<p>波根維爾島海上六次空戰，甚至後來的空軍戰果中，誰都抱憾的說；「如果再有若干的飛機，便可把敵艦殲滅殆盡。」又如很早便偵琛得敵船團的遊弋，但不能予以攻擊不得不放它過去，或對於敵人的登陸，不能予以完全阻當，諧如此類，一半在我飛機數量不足所致。那麼，要有多吵的飛機才够呢？然而對於其次的問題，誰也要發生疑問吧。因為飛機之量，不能舉出確定的數字。敞機數量多，我方自然要多，敵機少我方亦可以少。需要數量是相對的。我們在這裹只記下如次的此例吧。所羅門方面的敵機數量，在瓜達喀納島·新喬治島·糜達島·特洛基那等各空軍基地，佈置戰鬥及轟炸機一共一千架乃至一千二百架，其出動是四次輪流。但日方飛機數量與之比較起來差得許多，而且不知疲倦的我海軍空軍，沒有輸流，連日出而攻繫或邀擊。我們並不希望與敵同數的飛機，對於敵機量，須有必要的攻擊與防禦的一定數量便滿意的。只有唯一必要的是，有連簇不斷的接濟了。敵人對於連日的鉅大損耗，因其生產力量大，不斷地努力保持着一定的機敷。我方對此要維持一定的比率，是絕對必要的。任憑我勇敢無雙的空軍，亦時有實貴的犧牲，或時有因空戰，轟炸等蒙受轟炸不堪使用的飛機。若以一天損耗一架計算，一個月需三十架，兩個月六十架，所以要有不斷的接濟。</p>
<h3>敵婦女隊參加戰事</h3>
<p>飛機之迅速增產與蒙濟，一方面亦需要養成飛機土，關於此項，業於致府講究妥當的各種施策，我們亦深加相信。然而在這樣袛有一個問題要喚起注意的是，最近敵機亦有婦女參加在內的實施，除操縱兵等以外，敵大型飛機友婦女充作通信員鄧，又爲救援中途降陸的機士之大型飛機艇，乘有　婦，從事救助工作。不消說輕薄而好冒險的美國女性乘機，那是不是稱奇。不過在槍林彈雨中的前綫，雖然是女性亦可盡着航空兵力的一個任務，從這事實看來，並由希望航空員增加的現狀看來，豈不是債得老慮的問題嗎？女性動員的分野，並不局限於工廠，戰位或農村，嚴少在廣達的航空分野，除第一綫以外，於各地域的所謂民間航空運輸上，亦可代替男子，所以婦女應盡的分野可說廣而且大吧</p>
<h3>科學界應速起協力</h3>
<p>最後我們要呼籲科學急應總動員　起，各方面的戰綫都是集中「搭載槍火器」，「無綫通信兵器」，「電波兵器」等一切科學精粹。而在展開熾烈的科學戰，這是衆知的事實。在該地戰綫，科學之進度與其變化，值得瞪目。不啻一個兵器之性能的高度化，次第出現新的兵器。彼我飛機性能的發達，比較開戰當初，實有斷隔，例如其搭戰槍火器，我方有高性度支物，擊洛敵機戰績上大有可觀，但不久敵方也施之以特殊防禦裝甲，因此更需要高性度的兵器來了。</p>
<p>電波無為航空戰的前哨戰，或迅速發見敵艦船等，有最重要的任務，然而昨日之電波器在今日巳屬舊式。除空中電探以外，現在有海叩電探的出現，使潛水艦戰愈趨激烈，又如炸彈，敵方有跳躍魚雷，我方有〇〇彈等，新的兵器送出，今日飛機量之必要罟不待言，一方面一個新兵器的發明，實可凌駕數量之優勢，有此種重要性。所以一切科學陣營總動員這秋，除此時以外已無機會。</p>
<p>現在敵軍向太平洋內繞，研磨着爪牙，予我內綫作戰添增重要性。然而拉巴爾的戰略地位與價值，並未滅低。不，應其內綫作戰，拉巴爾在外部可以牽制敵艦艇，或死守此地，使敵方不能在該房面瘦得唯一的艦艇基地，或是在假以決戰「時日」的意義上，可增添了別的意義。於是在拉巴爾的忠勇義烈的我陸海將兵，於守勢中也取得緊密連絡提携之下，燃燒着比勝信念與戰意，正死守拉巴爾，並窺伺猛烈反攻的機會，航空使其達到這種目的，航空兵力之及早增強與科學完全的武裝，爲其重要之一。（弘譯自四月而日謮賣報知。）</p>
<h3>德國南部　新與工業地帶巡禮</h3>
<p>寒村一變工業都市</p>
<p>德國南部波希米亞及摩拉維亞保證地，自經嗣為新興工業地帶，已在戰爭中經過了五個年頭，益發有追隨魯爾地區，成為歐洲軸心國的兵工廠之勢。德國北部的工業都市，這英美空襲所受損害，已由南部工業都市補給而有餘。既存的工塔施設，從事大規模的擴充，固不消說；就新建設而論，例如戰前名稱都不知道的寒村，現已一變而為五萬王八萬人口的都市，實仕要使舊地重臨的旅客為之瞠目咋舌不置。</p>
<p>新與工業地帶，有出乎意外的大規模石炭液化大工場，各種兵器工場，還有鬼斧神工，利用自然地形，偽裝以避空襲的小規模軍需工塲，也陸續竣工。更就舊捷克的黨工業部能，添上新設備，平時產業轉為軍需工塲等種種澈底的措置。工塲的工人，比擊前增加兩倍，失業者當然絕無一人。而且待遇方面，自本年一月份起，當地工人與德國工人完全平等，取得比舊共和國時代更優越的條件。此舉以反足證該區在戰時工業上的重要地位。</p>
<p>保護地的統治</p>
<p>一九三九年三月，德軍進駐舊捷克斯拉夫後，即以波希米亞與拉麼維亞兩省，劃為保護地，迄今已滿五年。這其閻德國方面的唯一課題，即德國民族究竟能否與其他民族共存共榮的間題。這一問題倘能得到圓滿的解決，那末德國在包含諸民族的歐洲新秩序中，即可居於盟主地位。故保護地治績的優劣，實為一種試金石。但是德國的政策，對於保護領下的捷克，並不使其日耳變化，而尊重其民族的特贊及文化，在大德意志內，努力挾持其生存與繁榮。</p>
<p>捷克人豁除兵役義務，而毫受與德國伺樣的權利。保護地政府閣員除一人外，自總理以外，都是捷克人，其中多數係舊共和國時代政界與財界名流。官吏數類，捷克人佔一萬數千人，德國人不過佔五百人。保護領總籃弗里克，代衣布特勒元首，居於大總統的地位。保護地政府的實際政治行政的指導，及大德意志的聯絡，由波希米亞與摩拉維亞省大臣弗朗克以下少數穗國官吏任之。行政制度依省的二重組織，保護捷克人在大德意內生存，乃德國所苦心經營的。不管戰時種種困難，衛生，社會，文化各項設旅，將德國的徹底性組織性，發揮無遺，各各收到成果。例如紙張雖然不足，去年度仍出版捷克文的書籍九百萬部，幾及戰前的首分之九十·新設的靑年團，莫團體訓練的精神，保存捷克民族的特質，生趣盎然，朝氣蓬勃，這是德國以真的兄弟關係對待異民族的明證。</p>
<p>開闢共存共榮之道　　捷克的反總險謀與恐怖行動，以去年保護地總監赫特里樞暗殺事件為次機而滅退。雖在東部戰綫撇退的白，人心仍極穩定。民族協和的機運，努力參戰的姿態，隨處可見。簽者曾無忌諱的交換意見，綜合保護領各大臣，財界有力者以下比較尖銳的言論家所說的話，得到一個結說，即赫特里樞到捷克就任的當時，捷克人一般都以為赫氏為德國政治警察局長希墨婁的股肱，將推行苛刻的民族政策為懼。實際上，為維持治安，當然要採取嚴峻的政策，但對於捷克的民族文化與生持，則極力尊重，尤其是對於捷克人的所有機和管理權，竭盡保護之職。</p>
<p>此即對於捷克的猶太　平資本，使成為國營乃至國有化，但對於捷克人所有者，則不動分亳。例如捷兄最大兵器廠，「斯科達」廠，後歸海爾門·格林克公司經營，戰前反德的捷克共和國政府，曾將斯科達廠的股票，大部份賣與法國的席諾特廠，開戰後受敵產的處分，今日依然承認捷克人所持有的股票，最近擴張工塲實行增資，新股票已公開上市。</p>
<p>就大體而論，德國已踏上奧異民族共存共有的股票，最近擴張工業之途，其內部團結益見疆固，實為前途光明的徵兆。（譯自四月五日　賣報知）</p>

<p>夕陽西落，西天抹上了一片彩霞，自雲懶懶地向前移動，疲倦的禽鳥知道要回巢。廣場上的黃牛　着幽長的嗚聲，彷彿在呌它的主人快來牽它回家，茅屋的頂上炊烟裊裊，邨中的人們都在忙着晚餐。</p>
<p>晚風裹飄來一串淸脆的歌聲，隨着歌聲，從杏花林裹跳出一個活潑的小姑娘，約摸十六七歲的光景，她有一付與查化同樣美產的臉兒，尤其是一雙眸于，漆黑明亮靈活的轉動着，透露出她的天真無邪。她邊跳邊唱着：「太陽下山了呀，小羊兒回家了呀！媽媽等着親親，親親回家陪媽媽呀！」態跳愈遠，愈跳愈遠，漸漸地這活發的小影十便消失在暮色　了。</p>
<p>山脚下的茅屋前立着一個半老的婦人，她焦急的朝東望，兩手緊緊的搓着。達達地奔來了個活潑的小姑娘，婦人的面上浮起了一個欣慰的笑容。</p>
<p>「媽你瞧，張公公我的」。小姑娘高高地起手中的肉，笑着對她媽說。</p>
<p>「小杏！你今年歲數也不小了，怎麼還這樣野孩兒似的，成天在外面瞎跑，瞧媽明年給你說個邊家婆，讓他們好好的管管你。」</p>
<p>一朵紅雲飛上了她的面頰，小杏羞慚地垂下了頭，但她心裹暗暗地有些高興，因為往常她見小姊妹們出嫁，母親總給做些美麗的衣服。小杏呢，她最愛穿好看的衣服，可是家裹沒有錢，爸爸又早去世了，全靠媽一人做些女紅賺些錢來過活着，現在生活昻貴，飯都吃不餉，那裹還會有閑錢給小杏做衣服呢，所以她只夢想着有一天她出嫁了，媽給她做許多件好看的衣服。</p>
<p>日子飛快的過去，轉眼秋收已過了，家家戶戶都預備着糧，等候收糧的人來了好取去。小杏家裹這時候也有一些債要還給城裹的一位林大爺，但是她們卽無小杏爹遺留下的財業，又無田地可以耕種，故而一些貯蓄也沒有，平日得來的錢也只够支配一日的用度，所以這幾天小杏媽總是愁眉不展的悶悶無聲。小杏也不像從龍那樣的整天喜喜哈哈無憂無慮了。她知道將要有一件使得她們難堪的事發生。他希望林大爺能够忘記了這件事而不來逼取價還這三百元價金。可是事情並不能如此的簡單，三天以後討債的人來了，他兇狠狠地對小杏的媽說，非今天交出三百元不可，否則，就要趕她們出去，不准她們住在這屋裹了。小杏的媽苦苦哀求，但是這個人却假裝聾子，只當沒聽見。正當逍個時候小杏從隔壁借了些米回來，一見有個客人在學裹，便慌忙的向廚房一閃，但已被那位客人看見了，他的一雙賊眼緊盯着小杏，看了半天，然後若有所思似的點了點頭，便野小杏媽說道：「我看了看你家的樣于却是很苦，我一向是個忠厚的人，知道人家是戲苦，我就會開了他們的，現在，你瞧，我把這契約扔在　裏燒了它。」說完便把契約團了國扔在爐裏燒了。小杏媽感激得掉下了淚，逮聲的向這討債人稱謝而後恭敬地將他送。這天晚上她們娘兒倆非常高興的談着，說什麼都是吾樣保佑祖心不的陰德，所以討債的才會把契約給燒了。誰知好景不常禍殃也就　　快樂來了。第二天的早晨，這討債人又來了。他告訴小杏媽說是林大爺聽說她的女兒長得非常好，所以要想娶她做第四房的姨太太，同時還給小杏媽五百元錢及一對金鐲子做爲戰禮，預定五日後來迎娶，小杏媽正要說話，那人已經跑了。小杏媽沒有辦法，只得拿了鐲子及錢去告訴小杏，當小杏知道了以後，她便飯也不吃，事也不做，整天的哭泣，她說她寗死有不肯給林大爺去做姨太太，小杏媽呢，她自然也不願意她贊貝的女兒給林大爺去蹂躪。可是沒法子，人家有錢有勢自己這麼貧窮，不答應又怎麼樣呢。五天後一乘彩橋帶走了小杏，她雖然哭着掙扎不肯去，但是到底是屈服了。讓這些人吹吹打打把她抬走</p>
<p>又是一個黃昏一個春天的黃昏，晚風徐徐的吹着，搖動了樹技土的葉見，及地上的嫩草。杏花林的旁邊隆起了一個新墓墓上孤零零地長着幾朵野花，微風一起，搖搖欲倒。遠遠地來了一個婦人，她蹣跚的走到墓前，痴痴地跕着，突然她大聲的哭道：「小杏兒呀！到底是斷送了你」</p>
<p>杜鵑哀哀地在樹上啼着，夕陽照着，這正個的村莊照着了這土墓，也照着了這婦人——（她仍然痂痴地立着，動也不動。）她已昏倒在地上了。</p>
<h3>遙遠的途徑</h3>
<p>— 辛夷</p>
<p>我好像被注定了要在奔命中生活過去。整日整夜的將地球踢向脚後去，於是踏入了另一個新的境界，再稍稍瀏覽一下，重新跨出了它。這眞是一條長長的途程呵！而我，既不抱怨自己太優，又不想呌二條腿停息下來。好像我們瞥見一匹黑　然橫空突　過去一般，見到的，只是地搏翼奮飛的姿態，一眨眼，已消失在長空裹。這影像告訴我，又呌我驚異，真不知牠甚麼時候才想停息下來。我自已却又不免這樣做，我明白自己是不停地走着，但我不知道自己鸞走的一雖那，投人別人恨裹的是一個甚麼樣的影像。</p>
<p>而我又確乎被未盡的途程所蠱惑，「未來」總是件尚未知道的東西，我對於不知道的東西又抱着特强的欲求心，　味心。雖則所可奇怪的是當我眞嘴味到了時，我又不能不即把它故了不來，而閒始迷茫地望着前面，那裹還有我不知道的，於是，我撇下了過去——我永遠是這樣地迷茫着的。當然我沒有替自己列下一個關於生命歷程的預籌表之類的東西，恰又列不出來，這個理由，滾滾的流水或許會知道，試着去問他，但當你稍一遲疑問，牠毫不留戀地帶着一顆不掉的頭嘿嘿地奔前去了——誰知道牠要奔流向那裹？這只是這樣罷了。</p>
<p>有時，望到那些從天　急速地流瀉過去的白雲，在晚陽下逃循般湧退下去的朝夕，這樣性急，甚至於擠擠撞撞的，我幾乎疑惑南北極走近了距離。而這些形象閃在我心中，我的心也被奔騰澎湃得擴大了幾倍一般，更多地容納下天和地進去。這是說，我要走得更遠遠地。那些邊際呢？又只如一點藍色散開在水影中所漾出的一　微緣一樣，淡淡的，捉摸不到的，並且是漸愈消散下去的，這負應該着急的了，却不知道那一點藍依舊混在水裹，不過是這樣——找不到它。我總也這樣，心中的我有多大的天地，有多遙遠的途程，而　踏上了途程的我，又一只顯得多渺小，幾乎是湿和在這世界裹而消失在這要，那裹！但這，於我遷是無關，在一個「其實」的世界裹，消失了又算甚麼？</p>
<p>假使我歡喜笑，就笑的那些生活在「眞實」裹的「假」人惡，就惡的那些被「假」螫伏在生命裹的人；恨，就恨的扳過面孔後不有裝一下笑臉的人；悲，就悲的那些不知自已生命底分子的人；而罵呢，就只揀算盤珠生命的人罵。可是這不過說說罷了，我又何從而歡喜起來？那麼些多的途程怎能給我一下閒暇呵！</p>
<p>我就是這樣想的：未來的算是偶然，過去的是必然，當中的是適應。每一個人會適當地筆直地踏在地所立着的即使崎　得像蒸汽卷舒出來的路上。但是總之，這些都與我無關，要緊的是我還有這們多這們遠的途程要走啊！</p>
<h3>女高音歌唱家　茅愛立女士</h3>
<p>— 枝</p>
<p>住過北國的人，對於茅愛立女士大概都有相當的認識吧！近三年來，年年在北京，天津，靑島等地公閒舉行獨唱會，她的歌喉特點是靑於情感且又寬洪瞭亮。聽！當地唱李淸照詞「聲聲慢慢」曲的時候，她的面孔，她的聲音，就正像詞中的「尋尋覓覓冷冷淸淸悽悽慘慘切切」十四個字一樣的悲哀舟保，含淚欲滴；可是她在唱「早行樂」歌時，誰不為之數舞，歡欣？誰的心境不輕快，高興？</p>
<p>成功絕不是個然的。茅愛立女土的家庭環境，是一個極美好的音樂人才培養地，她的家住在靑島，她的父親又是一位小提琴家。據說當愛立小姐年方四齡的當見，隨着唱片已學會了蘇三的唱詞：「蘇三離了洪洞縣，將身來在大街前……」一段西度流水了，那時若是處在一個普通的家歷中，也許特之若承面不引以爲奇，可是她的令尊大人却不如此，他非但驚異她的人才，而且高興她的嗜好，今後有了承繼的女兒了。於是送變立小姐按步就班地上學，誤餘之　，灌授以皆業修養的知識，這是倍養那樣幼茅生長的要素。　　及長，她考入了燕京大學音樂學系，主修聲樂，曾數度担任「彌張亞」「創造曲」大會唱中的獨唱部分，極博得織音者的好評。事後回到靑島舉行有次獨唱會，於是奠定了她在音樂界中的地位。前年春天，她忽然離開了家庭，別開了舊友，姗姍地來到了上海，就學於蘇士林敎授門下，迄今兩年，已經學得了蘇士林敎授的一部分精萃，成為蘇氏最得意的門生之一。</p>
<p>學聲樂要會真幾國的文字呢？問答這個問題是很難的，它不像學科學或是文學，精通一兩國的文字便可以開謮很多的書籍，學唱歌不然，歌唱家是不分國籍的，我們聽見過去年的東賽舞踴團員來上海時演唱中國歌曲，　婉幽揚，同樣　愛立女士也是一樣，她常唱的靑英文「創造曲」，意文歌劇，德文渝伯特氏歌曲，和日文的歌詞的發音原則是同出一源的。</p>
<p>茅愛立女士平時為人怎樣呢？可以類兩居短語來做解答，那就是：　　，爽直，是她天賦的秉性；天才，努力，是她成就的原因。淸晨八點多鐘在愚園路上當可以發見她的踪跡，驕着一輛當由車飛馳電掣般的向西奔，那是趕着到聖約翰上課。直到現在，每天不斷的練唱，習新溫故估走了大部份的時間。此外呢，脂粉和錦績對於她似乎沒有吸引的力量。</p>
<p>就在本月的二十五二十六日，她將閒一次獨唱會，地點偕大華與關心大戲院，這次演唱的目的，無非是做進一步的試騐，她常說學習是無止境的，在上海賞識音樂的人，當然較請平津等地更多，她希望演次演唱之後，聽眾能給她一些切實的批評，以做將來改進的指針。這句話未免謙　過份，可是住在上海的人，因之得有機會聆到她的歌喉，倒是件可慶幸的喜訊。</p>
<p>計算着日期，就快屆臨了，當以虔誠的心靈祝福　健康並成功！靈祝福健康並成功！</p>
<h3>悼亡友</h3>

<h3>別矣北星，旅途珍重！　評述在滬六次戰況</h3>
<p>華北籃球臻征軍北星隊，此番南下，軍容壯茂。滬地人士，因渴慕北派球藝，倣忻若狂，每塲比賽，觀者潮湧。情形然烈，盛况空前。計該隊來滬比賽六塲，首二仗，即受挫於西靑及華聯藥。對中北一役，諸將漸復常態，打成平乎。繼在表演賓中，擊退華影。最後應西青挑戰，角逐兩場，因得德侶趙雅林李寶中効勞，各手李震中助陣，實力大增。第一戰將士効命，演出美妙，果使胡兒屈膝。第二塲滿擬乘勝直下，一鼓邊平，第以傳金聲足傷未愈，大受影響，以致壯志未酬，良用扼腕。茲追評六塲經過如左：</p>
<p>第一戰球路未熟</p>
<p>北星隊抵滬第一戰，於四月十日在八仙橋靑年會健身房舉行，對抗者為滬上西人混合隊。斯在觀眾之擁擠，非精筆所能形容。蓋球迷欽仰於派北派籃球之心，段且深矣。北星所到塲者有六將，稍維綱充在后備。上場之初，彼此均用埋首苦幹，毫無戰術表演，僅　個人表演而已。故上半時過程，極爲警張，西混以十四對十二僅勝二分。下半時變方各有軍師授計。西人利用戰備勝人，而北星則依然故我，一味猛撞，於是一任敵隊之遙領於先，而無法追上後出，終以二十一對三十見屈於西混。出師不利，諭者惋惜。考究其原因，當為西混能攻人之短，而北星則始終未能隨機應變為缺憾耳。</p>
<p>第二戰依然故我</p>
<p>第二戰，達征軍抗滬上華人盟主華聯藥廠籃球隊。按華聯藥之作戰方策，與西混大同小異。北星隊開始之初，憑其個人技術之高超，與南力致敵，分庭相抗，局勢相當驚駭’華聯藥終以花巧百出。錫麟。錦璇。有射必中。上半時十六對十一告捷。下半時北星極　改變戰略，多用智少用力。北星不察，致為詭計多端之華聯藥輕易取得勝利。比數為三十一對二十六。觀乎比數相近，可見北星非不可以贏也。奈何其僅知攻而不　守。臨大敵而如斯，未有不敗者也。此戰北星傳金聲之個人演出，確屬精彩異常，博得不少掌聲。</p>
<p>第三戰漸復常態</p>
<p>遠征軍出戰滬上北　宗匠中北隊，仍在八仙橋靑會。球　因震於兩個北派相爭，熱鬧狀况，固超乎以前兩戰也。斯役兩隊，均注意於得球後之速攻，而勁忽於嚴密之防守。原屬作風所政，亦以彼此禮讓而致此。然中北究以經騐較深，上半時以二十六對一卞先勝。下半時北星諸將，突見恢復面目。隊長　　公文見活躍，一脫其前二戰之故作泥扭，達射必中。常英之中鋒，又漸見進退裕如，而拍球之姿勢，尤能於此戰中，發揮無遺，令人贊美。比賽結果為四十九對四十九，未分勝。因屬友誼性質，雙方同意，不再延長，握手言和，北星已漸見恢復常熊矣。</p>
<p>第四戰初　捷報</p>
<p>此戰應華影體育會聯歡而賽，地點在該公司球塲，乃為硬地比賽。說者謂北派球習於泥土地者多，故能發揮威力，我亦未敢　然加以否認。唯稔知北星隊員本身，固認為地板與破地無分彼此也。華影為固厚實力起見，特邀國手李震中助戰，不使戰情一而倒也，然結果，遠征軍終以棋高一驚。蒞滬後，獲得第一次勝利，四十四對三十二，尚稱接近。華影注重在聯歡，除由女星周曼華胡楓等主持儀式外，並贈予北國健兒名貴紀念品，其情趣固別具一格。賓生之問，一番交流，尤為體育界罕見之真誠。</p>
<p>第五戰名將助陣</p>
<p>該隊承西靑當局之另眼相視，誠意挑戰。唯自最力不如人，敵隊頻施妙策時，恐難對付。故舊人李實中趙雅林（現隸中北，以前均為北星隊員。）決意効勞出隊，而另請李震中加入，以資接濟有人。果爾，以北派名手之會集，西靑雖亦舊圖勝利，終不免敗。况比賽地點，在西人靑年會，敵方得地利之優越。由此亦可見北星此勝之可貴。論之，有震中之接濟，為大原因。而常英之突見時來運來，發無不中，亦為大關鍵也。結果為四十一對三十八。觀比數，相當危險，可以不言而喻。總之，此戰可稱成功之戰。</p>
<p>第六戰精疲力盡</p>
<p>西靑失敗之餘，不甘於心，再約北贊。北星以離滬尚待二日，情不可却，毅然答尤。實則數戰之後，不免漸現精疲力盡之態，西靑究屬以逸待勞。故上半時北星尙能背城一戰，以十五對十四領前一分。至後，拼戰不够，以何言勝？徒見心勞力紐，功艇一贊。西靑得以操縱勝利也，三十八對三十一反敗為勝，北星終敗焉。</p>
<p>各個技術批評</p>
<p>綜計北星在滬六戰，二勝一和三負。戰績雖未見彪炳；然全隊氣力充沛，攻如閃電，淸晰美觀。環顧滬上，無出其右。而於運動道德，均能深切注意，尤屬可貴，尼為各球員效法。至個人技術之批評，容述於次：</p>
<p>范慶公——任前錚，射　確有可觀。臨陣頗鎭之前鋒，射籃亦見功夫，爲全隊得分銷　。此君年</p>
<p>傳金聲，——監最佳之前鋒，射籃亦見功夫，為全隊得分鎖鑰。此君年富力壯，前途未可限量。</p>
<p>常英——月來滬數戰中任中鋒，進退迅速，拍球姿勢美妙。信乎其基本之高超，值得識揚。唯輙見其在緊要關頭時，一籌莫展，而現慌張。</p>
<p>郭耀嵩——體格魁梧，後衛最標準人材，勇敢無匹。其不足者，勇而少諜。</p>
<p>郭湧恩——據云：在北平任中鋒，唯在滬任後衛時多。各方面俱佳，惜時常守少而攻多，發現漏洞。或為不慣任後衛所致歟？</p>
<p>趙維關——在滬演出極心，不敢加以評述。</p>
<p>別矣北星</p>
<p>總之，該歐個人技術，相當可觀，唯全隊對於戰術，尚少研究。採「人釘人」未見得法。一過强敵當前，祇知拼命苦鬥，未能隨機應變。此蓋北地打法，墨守陳規，環境使然。此次南來一教訓，當能將南方之長，携返北國，善加揣摩。則他山之石，可以攻玉，運用之妙’在於一心，登峯造極，可以預卜。語云：「土別三月，便當括目相看。「他日重來，再顯身手，吾知其必能一新重江人士之眼界也。勉之載！勉之哉！</p>
<p>現遠征軍北星定今日離滬，　歌一唱，何日重臨，別矣北星，別矣北國健兒！旅途珍重！努力自愛！</p>
<h3>對於北星隊之我見</h3>
<p>— 余郇子</p>
<p>年來滬上籃球比賽參加者，俱係打慣打熱之幾隊，觀麼日久，各隊之攻守技術，彼此莫不暸若指掌。此次北星隊之征滬，使我滬上球隊，得一切磋之良機，空氣為之一新。該隊在滬首先三戰，雖負二和一，但不能以一時之成敗論英雄。蓋該隊技術方面，頗有可取之處，我等討其長短，用資　。就管見所及表而出之。</p>
<p>西青之役</p>
<p>是日比賽西靑隊員之表演，還不如以前在西靑聯賽時之純熱。除勃脫及奧柴遼兩後衛演來較為出色外，其餘略見生疎。何以北星仍不能取勝，因其在攻守兩方，尚不及西靑隊之故耳。北星之防守法，以人釘人為王，然運用尚未得法，每使對方有隙可乘。西靑進攻以阻擋法取勝，北星不能迅速轉變亙移其位置，以阻止對方之進攻。且籃下搶球，每為西靑所得，遂使西靑籃下擲球之機會，遠較北星為多。北星之進攻法，以快速度之傳球，而使兩後術偷襲，雖五人合作有相當默契，但西靑之人釘人防守法，為滬上各隊之冠。處此情形之下，北星不知利用阻撓法或樞紐法以破之，遂致無法深入籃底，終遜一籌。</p>
<p>華聯之戰</p>
<p>北星隊仍以人釘人法為防守，而華聯則以三二式五人聯防，華聯雖亦不能應用阻擋法或樞紐法而進攻。但特其聯絡之純熱，閃電式之進攻，及場地之熱識，得以取勝。開塲時，北星前錄衝回中綫接球，再傳與後衛，而偷襲籃下，方法殊佳。惜用此　戰術，為時甚暫，及後常徘徊於對方防區之外，互相傳滬，致球不能深入敵陣，遂使段籃機會大减。試觀下半時，球每傳至華聯籃下，回用轉身投籃法投籃，多建奇功，即可知之。以北星隊員之身材，及跳躍之高度，此類投籃，華聯二衛實無法制止。可惜上半時未多利用此法，為不能取勝之要因也。在球如傳至投籃區，而無人阻礙時，必須投籃，此為投籃之要訣。然北星隊每於此區域內，當擲而不擲，再繼績傳遞，遂致屢失投籃良機。該戰最後三分鐘時，北星以緊逼釘人法作戰，　挽回頹勢，但仍未能奏效，反予華聯以閃點進攻之機會，隊致敗北。</p>
<p>中北之爭</p>
<p>中北隊員趙雅林與李中北之爭賽中之缺席，隊使該隊實力大爲遜色，然北星仍不能因此而取勝，誠出意料之外。中北以三二式聯防，進攻迅速遠勝北星。北星以用閃電戰術見長，但是役演來未見本領，使對方有返防回守之機會。三戰中以比戰最為減色。開塲時北星以二一二式聯防法，上陣五分鐘後，仍改用人釘人法，當北星用聯防法時，所處位置既不適當，移動又欠靈活，而使中北易於深入籃下。是役北星投籃多為遠射，反觀中北之得分，多為籃下擲球。其後北星後術郭湧恩減，大受打擊。該晚北星　，大受打擊。該晚北星全隊合作錯誤，較前兩戰爲多，故中北陣容雖殘缺不全，仍能把我全句，使北星無法取勝。</p>
<p>綜觀三戰，北星諸將能跑善跳，雙手胸前推出　球之快速準確，與衝前按球之敏捷，滬上合隊實無出其右者。個人技術亦多在水進以上，然全隊之進攻法，似嫌陳舊。至於體育道德，及戰鬥精神，多可效法。其兩後衛之偷獲，出神入化，技術為全隊之冠。惜對於防守之法，未能運用得宜。藍凡防守者，宜面敵背籃，而成直綫。換言之，使敵人走外圈，本人退走內圈，而以　爲中心點。北星隊員之防守，每當敵人衝前時，則轉身向後，追隨敵人，反而落於敵人之後。同時其防守區，似嫌太欠，每使敵人得以逃避，而衝至籃下投藍，乃其防守之最弱點。如該隊用敵進我退，敵退我進法，在敵人得球時面對守者，使無法投藍。並使投藍區無　可乘，則對方不易進攻矣其進攻時，無適宜之方式，以破敵人之五人聯防或人　人法。鄙意每一球隊，必具有二極防守法，如五人聯防或人釘人等法，以視敵方進攻之情勢，而隨機應變。如對方之善用阻擋法以進攻者，則以五人聯防法應付之。如敵人不善於以阻擋法進攻者，則宜以人釘人法應付之。兩種防守法之方式，始可在進攻時，亦須具有破此成爲一上乘之球隊。以北星健兒身材體力，及個人技術之敏捷，再加以良好之指導，並改善攻守二法，將成滬上各隊之勁敵矣</p>
<h3>體壇雜錄</h3>
<p>民立女中，對於體育歷史上素有成績，尤以排球為最者名。如過去之祝士芳黃杏芬均代表中國出應遠東。該校體育主任張覺非君更爲提倡。新近成立之藍球隊，成績已　然可觀，隊員蕭瑛盛景漱莊錦牡，均活潑矯健，不在一般老將之下。我謂其出而應戰，必可以擴我人耳目。</p>
<p>足球比賽，最為球迷擁護，唯以熱情奔騰，迺者，當局已接洽假跑馬廳比賽，則前車之鑒，歷歷在目。深望常局詳細計劃。其最主要者，我以為統計票數，多加警　，多設進口及購票窗口等等。俾不再跑馬應再現　圍逸圖之情形，而不令比賽無球場也幸矣。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n108</h1>
<h3>Seizing the Opportunity for Political Reform</h3>
<p>Since the National Government relocated its capital, over four years have passed. If we attempt a review of the actual state of central politics in the past, it is undeniable that various ailments exist. Analyzing them:</p>
<p>Political institutions are not yet perfect. The most obvious aspect is that a representative body has not yet been established. The central government's lack of a representative body has prevented local governments from establishing their own independently.</p>
<p>Political institutions are excessively large, emphasizing form over substance, and unwilling to engage in practical work. Institutions were established for temporary circumstances without comprehensive consideration, resulting in too many redundant branches, which, in terms of political efficiency, are equivalent to being virtually non-existent.</p>
<p>Personnel matters are unsound. The appointment of officials has not adopted a meritocratic approach, failing to achieve expert governance. Instead, harboring notions of kinship, regionalism, and partisanship inevitably leads to the bad habit of employing personal connections. The most glaring examples are the recently occurred Hou-Hu case and the entire Grain Department's corruption scandal.</p>
<p>Administrative efficiency is low. The main reason lies in the duplication and overlap of redundant agencies, filled with superfluous personnel. Meanwhile, civil servants' salaries are too low, and their livelihoods are unstable, making it difficult to expect dedicated service.</p>
<p>There is no firm conviction regarding the direction of the situation, and there is a strong tendency to harbor a "wait-and-see" mentality. Therefore, it is impossible to be grounded in reality and alleviate the unnecessary suffering of the people during wartime, or to bring politics in the peaceful areas onto the right track. Especially after rejoining the war, it has failed to exert practical strength.</p>
<p>If an individual develops an illness, accurate diagnosis and targeted medication are naturally required. Moreover, it is essential to seek treatment promptly to prevent it from spreading or worsening. If a nation's politics develop ailments, which are related to the rise and fall of the entire national destiny, it is ten thousand times more important than an individual. It is absolutely necessary to seek immediate treatment after an accurate diagnosis. We do not hesitate to offer advice. Regarding the past ailments of central politics, we have made the above diagnosis and must implement appropriate treatment targeting the symptoms. At the same time, we believe that the current situation has reached a complex and severe stage, and we cannot afford to hesitate and be indecisive. As the saying goes, "A quick diagnosis requires a slow remedy," and failure to treat quickly is very dangerous. Secondly, if surgery is required after diagnosing the illness, do not hesitate, lest it spread. For example, corruption is like a tumor that must be excised. We must have the determination to cut through the Gordian knot and eradicate corruption. On one hand, it is necessary to inject tonics to nourish vital energy and enhance resistance. For example, employ new talent, break down partisan biases, and eliminate notions of kinship and regionalism.</p>
<p>Political reform is urgently needed at the central level. As Chairman Wang of the National Government is currently recuperating and temporarily unable to personally manage central state affairs, with Mr. Chen Gongbo and Mr. Zhou Fohai jointly presiding, they should immediately take full responsibility and promote reform. Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhou are outstanding political talents in the central government, possessing knowledge, insight, experience, and passion. We believe they are extremely clear about the past ailments of central politics. Furthermore, in terms of Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhou's positions, this is the best opportunity to contribute to the nation. They must seize the current best opportunity to reform politics. We hope they will make a determination, considering the future of the entire nation, the improvement of the entire people's livelihood, and the rise and fall of the entire Greater East Asia, and no longer worry about the constraints of the internal environment. For the political malady that cannot be managed, adopt the opinions of allied nations and public sentiment, and promptly reform it. We also suggest:</p>
<p>Establishing a central representative body as soon as possible and urging local areas to establish representative bodies to communicate public opinion and start afresh with the people.</p>
<p>Eradicating corruption comprehensively and rigorously. Paying attention to strictness in rewards and punishments. Since the execution in the Hou-Hu case, the full details of the case should be announced as soon as possible to inform the nation and deter corruption. On the one hand, reorganize tax revenue and revise the tax farming system, or reasonably increase tax revenue to enrich finances. In particular, substantially increase civil servants' salaries to stabilize their lives, reduce the motivation for corruption, and increase administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>Merging or abolishing redundant agencies and idle personnel that do not conform to the wartime system as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Reorganizing local administration and establishing security to stabilize the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Today, this newspaper specifically publishes an editorial by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun, "Hoping the National Government to Eradicate Politics." Allied public opinion is full of enthusiasm, expecting our country's political reform. We share the same sentiment and have presented the above commentary based on our observations. Chairman Wang of the National Government has been in Japan for over a month for medical treatment. We, standing from the people's perspective, urgently demand that the government announce a plan for political reform and the results of its implementation to appease the eager hopes of the people.</p>
<p>Commentary and Translation</p>
<h3>Hoping the National Government to Eradicate Politics</h3>
<p>Today's China must implement increased production; this is undeniable. Even the price issue can no longer be resolved solely through economic means. It has become a deeply rooted political problem. Therefore, all parties are striving to first reform politics. For example, general corruption allows officials to extract the blood and sweat of farmers and oppress the people without reason. As a result, not only is the farmers' hard work wasted, but this increase in production is of no benefit to the nation and only enriches corrupt officials. Therefore, the prerequisite for increasing production is to eradicate corrupt officials. Before notifying materials and governing the people, the government must first control the officials. This growing call is not without reason.</p>
<p>The National Government's recent execution of several officials from the Stabilized Food Department is indeed a harbinger of political purification, bringing about a new atmosphere. However, if this corrective action is seen as merely a flash in the pan and does not lead to a thorough resolution, it will certainly fail to meet the expectations of the national people. Therefore, we hope the National Government can thoroughly implement the expected policies. The National Government includes various parties, factions, and non-partisans. If political correction lacks a thorough determination and is focused on bias towards one party or faction, then Party A will specifically label Party B as corrupt officials, attacking each other. As a result, the disputes among the various factions within the country will still not be eliminated and will continue to struggle. If this continues for a long time, the effort to strengthen political power through renewal will instead cause division in political power, leading to countless adverse consequences for the National Government's self-strengthening efforts.</p>
<p>We hope that the correction can be active and decisive, and there must be no delay. It cannot continue to hinder the production area. For example, regarding the price issue, if we wait until there is a shortage of goods before correcting corrupt officials and profiteers, it will be too late, and prices will still be uncontrollable.</p>
<p>We repeatedly state here, without fear of repetition: officials should strive to reduce personal consumption, devote themselves to the operation of administration. Authorities colluding with speculators, if they engage in hoarding and speculation, their crimes deserve ten thousand deaths. What Chairman Mao called the "traitors of the nation" are these kinds of corrupt officials. We sincerely hope that the gentlemen of the National Government can take active and decisive action against these domestic enemies.

<h3>Active Japanese Air Force Shoots Down 41 Enemy Planes in Indian Territory and Destroys Enemy Airfield Facilities in Palel</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:40 PM on the 20th that the Japanese air force in the Burma area shot down 41 enemy planes over the Imphal basin in April, three of which have been confirmed. At the same time, they bombed the enemy airfield in Palel, destroying its affiliated facilities. Five Japanese planes have not yet returned. Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army air force in the Burma area has been cooperating in the offensive operations in India for days, bombing enemy airborne troops who were parachuting in the vicinity of Kaching, completely thwarting the enemy's attempt to reinforce their main force, and operating vigorously within the Imphal basin. On the 17th, a fighter squadron, in cooperation with ground troops, launched a fierce attack on Meiktila (a key point south of the Imphal basin) over the Imphal basin. On the same day, at dusk, they attacked a large formation of enemy fighter-bombers over Bishenpur. The Japanese planes formed a unified force, broke into the enemy plane group, and engaged in a fierce air battle. In this battle, they shot down 25 Spitfire enemy planes, 10 P51s, and 6 A35s (three of which were unconfirmed), totaling 41. In addition, a joint formation of fighter-bombers also attacked the enemy airfield in Palel before and after this, overcoming the stubborn resistance of enemy fighters and hitting all the affiliated facilities of the enemy airfield, thoroughly destroying them. Three Japanese fighters did not return in the air battle over Bishenpur and the battle of Palel, but the fact that Japanese planes shot down 41 enemy planes is enough to reflect a glimpse of the battle of Imphal. Since the 18th, the number of enemy planes cooperating with the enemy ground forces in the counter-offensive has decreased significantly. Also, due to the lack of aerial resupply, the enemy's resistance has been greatly reduced, and the Japanese offensive units are continuing to advance rapidly.</p>
<h3>Japanese-Indian Allied Forces Occupy the Leimakhong River Valley; Enemy Troops in Shenam Have Signs of Retreat</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a Japanese army base on the Indian front reports that the Japanese-Indian allied forces, which launched a fierce attack on the 405-kilometer high ground 15 kilometers northeast of Imphal, have captured the area in the Leimakhong River Valley north of the high ground on the 17th, after seizing the position of the enemy's main force since dawn on the 14th, with reinforcements from new elite troops, and have put the enemy army's life in their hands. On the other hand, the Japanese-Indian allied units that occupied the 3524 high ground 20 kilometers northeast of Imphal have been attacking the enemy who launched a counter-offensive led by tanks since the 15th. On the morning of the 17th, they echoed their friendly forces who had circled behind the enemy position and suddenly surrounded about 1,000 enemy troops, and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. The enemy troops who lost the 3524 high ground are currently building positions on the 4214 high ground only 3 kilometers northwest of the high ground, continuing to resist with tanks and artillery as support. Other Japanese-Indian allied units also advanced to the rear of the enemy army on the 17th, echoing each other and launching fierce attacks on the enemy army.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base on the Indo-Burma Front, 20th (Central News Agency) - The elite Japanese-Indian troops launched a fierce attack on Tiddim, a fortress in front of Palel, on the 14th, capturing enemy positions and high ground. As a result, the first line of strongholds has all fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. Although the remaining enemies are stubbornly resisting, the overall situation of the battle in that area has been decided. Since the 18th, the enemy army has shown a gradual retreat in the Shenam position 4 kilometers behind the area. The Shenam fortress behind Tiddim was subjected to fierce Japanese artillery fire. On the 18th, the ammunition depots and fuel depots in the area were hit and exploded in flames, burning for four days, which was extremely tragic. The main force of the enemy's 20th Division was thus shaken.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Thwarted in Raids on Rabaul and Other Islands</h3>
<p>Enemy planes thwarted in raids on Rabaul and other islands Rabaul, 20th (Central News Agency) - On the Rabaul front, about 500 enemy fighter-bombers raided in succession on the 18th. The Japanese army shot down three of them, and the Japanese side suffered minor damage. Also, in the Buin area of Bougainville Island, 12 enemy fighters raided on the 18th. One was shot down by the Japanese army, and the Japanese side suffered no damage. Also, in the Buka Island area adjacent to Bougainville Island, 22 enemy fighter-bombers raided on the 18th. The Japanese army shot down three of them, and the Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>

Mr. Mawar Mahmad, editor-in-chief of the Malay News Agency, has decided to change his past attitude of belittling agriculture and give up the pen for farming.

The Chairman reported that the case presented by the Secretariat, approving the letter sent by the Legislative Yuan regarding the political work reports for November and December of the 32nd year and January of the 33rd year, requesting that it be forwarded for record, had been approved for record. [Discussion Matters] The Chairman submitted for discussion a memorial submitted by President Jiang of the Examination Yuan regarding expanding and promoting examination methods. The Chairman submitted for discussion a case presented by the Secretary approving the letter sent by the Civil Service Office of the National Government regarding the expenses of the Special Court and the estimated budget for the opening and decision of temporary expenses, which had been first sent to the Financial Affairs Committee for review as usual, approving the letter in reply to the review opinions, proposing to reduce the regular expenses to 62,100 yuan per month, together with an additional salary of 59,900 yuan, for a total of 122,900 yuan per month, and a temporary expense of 100,000 yuan, requesting review and approval.

Huitong News Agency: German naval patrols and minesweepers in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay reported that the number of mines laid by the enemy has greatly increased. Since the 7th of March, the work of German minesweepers has increased threefold. The enemy's large-scale deployment of mines at this time can be seen as a prelude to the opening of the Second Front, in order to hinder the actions of German warships and escort fleets off the coast of Western Europe, but as a result, the enemy has so far failed to halt German shipping off the coast of France. Most of the mines used previously were magnetic mines, which are different from the previous contact mines that detonated when they touched a ship. Eden Undertakes Special Mission. Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency). According to Washington sources, British Foreign Secretary Eden and U.S. Undersecretary of State have left London simultaneously to consult with a senior foreign official.

The resolution was passed. The Chairman submitted for discussion a memorial submitted by the Military Affairs Commission stating that the Standing Committee of the Commission had approved the abolition of the Commander-in-Chief's Wuhan Pacification Headquarters, the establishment of the Wuhan Pacification Director's Office, and the special appointment of Yang Puyi as the Pacification Director in Wuhan, requesting review and approval.

<h3>Cao Yucheng, a Major Drug Trafficker in Beijing, Executed</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - In January of this year, the Capital Student Drug Eradication Association, together with students from the Cadre Training Camp, seized a white powder drug den on Fengfu Road and arrested Cao Yucheng, a major trafficker of white powder drugs, on the spot.

<h3>Focus of the Eastern Front War Will Shift Soon; Major Battle to Break Out Within Old Polish Borders</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to military commentator Harungsleben of the German News Agency, the concentration of Soviet troops north of the central-southern section of the Eastern Front indicates the Soviet intention to break into the territory of the General Governorate of Poland, established by Germany in occupied Poland. As the situation develops, the focus of the war will soon shift. The apparent goal of the Soviet military authorities is to penetrate the flank of the German northern line and cut off the German troops there, but so far, the German troops in that area have been able to cope with the enemy's frontal attacks. This is rarely done. In the past few days, the Soviet army has devoted all its efforts to attacking. Now, with the increasing activity of the German army and its allies, its offensive has greatly diminished. Although it is not possible to immediately conclude that this offensive by the Soviet army has come to an end, both sides have adjusted their front-line troops, and the outbreak of the Second World War should be at another point on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: According to an official announcement here, the German-Hungarian allied forces advanced yesterday towards the Carpathian Mountains and the upper reaches of the Humska River, gaining further expansion.

On the 19th, the content of the Irish Free State's Prime Minister's note and the Foreign Ministry's reply were also announced. Details are as follows: Note from the Prime Minister of the Irish Free State (March 20th): "Deeply concerned about the imminent destruction of Rome. Should one of the belligerent nations use Rome for military defense, and the other belligerent nation launches a military attack, Rome will inevitably be destroyed. In order to protect this ancient religious and cultural capital with nearly two thousand years of history, it is hoped that the belligerent nations will seek ways to safeguard it." Unsigned memorandum from the German Foreign Ministry (April 18th): "To protect Rome, the German government has decided to make Rome a completely demilitarized city, eliminating any pretext for anti-Axis forces to attack Rome. Firstly, a strict order prohibits the commanders of the German army from lodging in the city of Rome. Secondly, the railway network in Rome will be exclusively used to supply civilian needs, especially food for the citizens of Rome. Thirdly, German soldiers are generally not allowed to enter or leave the city of Rome. The German army will not only not conduct military defense in Rome, but will also ensure that there are no military targets within the city of Rome. The responsibility for destroying the holy city lies entirely with the US and British military commands."</p>

<h3>Vice Minister of Justice Kong Explains Mission in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Kong Xianggu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, is in Shanghai on official business. When reporters interviewed Mr. Kong yesterday to inquire about the purpose of his visit, he replied as follows: "After the establishment of the Special Tribunal of the National Government, the internal personnel, from the presiding judge to the staff at all levels, are mostly concurrently serving officials from this ministry and its directly affiliated agencies. However, the system is completely different, and outsiders who do not understand the truth have made incorrect reports. Yesterday's news about me coming to Shanghai to investigate Mr. Hou's property is likely the same misunderstanding. I also serve concurrently as the Director of the Ministry's Shanghai Office. In addition to the Deputy Director handling daily affairs, I personally oversee important matters. Currently, Minister Zhang is extremely concerned about the food rations for prisoners in detention centers and the treatment of judicial personnel. The purpose of my visit to Shanghai this time is to contact the Rice Control Committee to request the allocation of 934 shi of rice for the detention centers for March and April of this year, and to send personnel to pay the rice funds to the committee. In addition, the municipal government subsidizes Shanghai's judicial expenses with 250,000 yuan per month, which is also requested by this office on the ministry's orders. A total of 750,000 yuan for January, February, and March of this year has been requested by this office. The above is the task of my visit, which has nothing to do with the rumored investigation of Mr. Hou's property."</p>
<h3>Victory for Independence in This Battle: Letter from Mr. Chen Gongbo to Chairman Bose</h3>
<p>To His Excellency Bose, Leader of the Provisional Government of Free India: I have received great news from the Indian front. Under your leadership, the Free India National Army, in cooperation with the allied Japanese forces, has broken into Indian territory, and victory is in sight. Overwhelmed with excitement, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the National Army for their successes and pray for the success of the Free India independence movement. At the same time, I would like to briefly describe the views of our country's revolutionary patriots and revolutionary people on the current situation. Three Decisive Factors</p>
<p>This war, narrowly speaking, is a war against the British and Americans, but in a broader sense, it is a war between the righteousness of national coexistence and international aggression. The purpose of the war is not to antagonize any one country or nation, but to smash the old order of international aggression, sweep away all vengeful and destructive mentalities, and prevent them from poisoning the world again. There are three decisive factors in the war: first, the conflict of interests among the aggressors; second, the revolutionary demand for independent survival of oppressed nations; and third, the awakening of the world's humanity to the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity. It is no coincidence that the nations of East Asia have risen up together and are fighting together. It is also no coincidence that the allied nation of Japan has resolutely risen up to aid China, India, and other nations of East Asia, serving as a pioneer in defending East Asia. We can assert that this is the inevitable outcome of historical development.</p>
<p>To overturn the old order of international aggression, we must first overthrow the demons that have nested in this old order for two or three hundred years, and we must also guard against the wicked accomplices who take the opportunity to stir up trouble. Even now, the mastermind who is secretly manipulating events from behind is actually the wicked accomplice, Britain and America. Opposition to the intentions of Britain and America is the expression of this. To achieve this goal, we must strike down the greatest basis for the unbridled aggression of British imperialism, defend the Pacific, and hinder the rampant aggression of American imperialism. This is a necessary process.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the liberation of India is not only the restoration of the independence and freedom of the Indian nation, but also has a great impact on the completion of China's independence and freedom. It is closely related to the survival and safety of the nations of East Asia.</p>
<p>The Inseparability of Chinese and Indian Liberation</p>
<p>The Chinese revolution has been going on for sixty years. Although it has experienced setbacks and revivals, it has not yet succeeded because the scope of past movements has been limited to a single revolution. The significance of the connection between the revolutions of the two great nations of China and India, and the inseparability of the Chinese revolution, the Indian revolution, and the liberation of East Asia, lies entirely in this. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this significance became even clearer. Only by winning the Greater East Asia War can the great national revolutions of China and India move forward. Only under the conditions of the certain victory of the Greater East Asia War can the demands for independent survival of the two great nations of China and India be realized.</p>
<p>Therefore, we ourselves must constantly strive, deeply appreciate the sincere assistance of our allies, and promote the unity of the East Asian nations, correctly recognizing the responsibilities we should bear for East Asia.</p>
<p>What is most distressing is that even today, some people in our country have forgotten Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, forgotten the expectations of our revolution for your country's revolution, and also forgotten the spiritual resonance that your revolution has given to our country. Not only have we failed to provide practical assistance to liberate your country's independence, but some people have even assisted the aggressors in hindering it. This is truly a disgrace to the Chinese nation. But I dare to tell Your Excellency with determination that our country's revolutionary patriots and revolutionary people can no longer tolerate this stain on the Chinese revolution. In the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the heroic victory of the allied nation of Japan and the smooth progress of the Indian people's single-minded practice cannot but serve as a final warning to these elements. We firmly believe that revolutionary China will rise up for unity, with the united strength of the whole country, following Free India and the allied nation of Japan, standing in the same battle line, sharing life and death, and launching a death battle with our common enemy for our own homeland and for a common East Asia.</p>
<p>This time, Your Excellency has raised this great righteousness, taken up the weapons to save the motherland, and used troops with swiftness. The will of your people is becoming more and more firm, and the enemy is collapsing in fear. The completion of the independence of Free India is imminent. The vast number of people groaning under the iron heel of the brutal enemy will receive great comfort. The unification of the Chinese revolution and the completion of the liberation of East Asia depend on your success. I wish Your Excellency good health and the prosperity of Free India, and a bright future for the liberation of East Asia. (Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi, April 11th)</p>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Formulates Water Conservation Measures to Prevent Disputes Among Users</h3>
<p>Since the city implemented restrictions on citizens' use of water and electricity, using resources to conserve materials, users often have disputes as a result. Therefore, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has specially formulated water and electricity conservation violations, which have been submitted to the municipal government for approval and implementation. According to the new quantity restrictions for water and electricity conservation set by the water and electricity companies, if the limit is exceeded, once the situation is clarified, penalties will be imposed according to law. Users should inform each sub-household of the quantity of water and electricity used by the attached household, in accordance with the notice from the water and electricity company, and enjoy it in proportion within the limit. They must not use the excuse of control to abuse and interfere with each sub-household. If there are exceptions for medical use, they must also be negotiated in advance. If the limit is exceeded as a result, the sub-household shall be responsible. When a penalty is imposed for exceeding the limit, it should also be shared proportionally. If it is found that the limit is about to be exceeded, the user may notify the sub-household to temporarily stop using it, but it must be restored in the following month and must not be refused.</p>
<h3>Second Police Bureau Adjusts Personnel</h3>

<h3>Financial Institutions Unify Accounting Names, Financial Inspection Department Sets Standard for Subjects</h3>
<p>The Financial Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank believes that the names of accounting subjects currently used by various financial institutions are not uniform. Some have different names for the same category, or the same name with different realities. Each is independent, not connected to each other, disorganized and chaotic, and there are no standards, which greatly hinders success. In order to facilitate inspection and promote the sound development of financial business, the department has convened accounting supervisors of various financial institutions several times to study and discuss the standardization of accounting subjects of financial institutions. After consultation, a standard for accounting subjects was produced, and the unified accounting subjects were stipulated and sent to various financial institutions to follow the implementation methods. All general commercial banks, trust companies, savings banks, and provincial, municipal, and county local banks, except as otherwise provided by laws and regulations, shall "use the prescribed accounting subjects. (Financial institutions such as money houses, silver shops, or silver companies shall be allowed to use the bank's benefits and subjects) The department also compiled the unified financial institution benefits and subjects into a volume, which was distributed to various financial institutions for reference. The British Airlines Benefits and Subjects (including asset category, liability category, loss category, profit category) have a total of 119 types of names, and the letter The company's benefits and subjects have a total of 27 types of names. The savings bank's accounting subjects have a total of 10 types of names (the above trust company savings banks also have general benefit and subjects names that are the same as the nature of general banks, which are not listed above)</p>

<h3>Cotton Cloth Rationing and Children's Clothing Problems</h3>
<p>— Wu Zheng</p>
<p>The implementation period of cotton cloth rationing is approaching. Before that, I have a small suggestion.</p>
<p>Currently, almost no school in Shanghai has students wearing school uniforms. The reason for this is of course the high price of cloth and the unavailability of materials. But I believe that the purchase of school uniforms is quite necessary for both the students and the school authorities. It cannot be denied that the reason why children in our country are not as lively and active as children in foreign countries is also due to clothing restrictions. Therefore, now we can take advantage of this cotton cloth rationing to think of a way. Let the future masters of the country not be sluggish in action and spirit due to wearing long robes and coats, which affects their health and work efficiency.</p>
<p>For the sake of brevity, I list five methods below:</p>
<p>Each student submits the set price along with the cloth purchase certificate to the school party authority.</p>
<p>The school authority must collect the collected funds and cloth purchase certificates as soon as possible, and submit an application (the number of cloth purchase certificates and funds can be detailed in this letter) to the Cotton Cloth Joint Management Office.</p>
<p>The joint management office distributes cloth of the same color to each school according to the amount of cloth needed by each school (coarse cloth with strong quality is the best)</p>
<p>After each school is allocated cloth, it will determine its own style: (the style of the Youth League can be used as a model, and those with unsuitable colors can make Zhongshan suits and Western-style shorts. It is quite good.) Uniform tailoring, while averaging wages and notifying each student. Each student exchanges uniforms from the school authorities for the wages that the school authorities indicate should be paid.</p>
<p>The school authority must fully and obligatorily implement this, because this is originally a matter of improving the school. As with the distribution of educational bureau sneakers this time, some schools have taken the opportunity to seek profit, which is a great sin! Wage accounts must also be fully disclosed.</p>
<p>This suggestion is probably something that all large, medium and small schools in Shanghai are happy to respond to. Although, the method I said is very simple, I hope that the Chamber of Commerce and the Cotton Cloth Joint Management Office can provide assistance. I am sure it is not difficult to do. As for the students' parents, adding clothes for their children in the same way will not be the same as calculating on the form and not agreeing!</p>
<p>Then, soon we can see that the spirit of the young students is even more radiant and courageous!</p>

<h3>The Unfalling Fortress - Rabaul</h3>
<p>Since entering March, the South Pacific line has shown clear signs of tension, and the moment of decisive battle is already upon us. The elite Japanese troops, centered on Buin at the southern tip of Bougainville Island, have been enduring for several months in various parts of the island, preparing for the coming battle. In early November, they launched a fierce counterattack against the enemy's base at Torokina. The Japanese forces gradually gained control of the enemy's airfield and various facilities, and the enemy also mobilized large-scale air power, or used ground firepower, to desperately defend. The evolution of the situation, although unpredictable, was triggered by the counterattack on Torokina, and enemy air forces launched large-scale air raids on key Japanese strongholds such as Rabaul and Kavieng, making the battle line comprehensively intensify. The enemy's counterattack on Rabaul has become increasingly fierce since early spring this year, with two hundred to three hundred and several dozen aircraft attacking three times a day. However, the enemy realized that the most important Japanese stronghold was difficult to attack, and that bombing would result in great sacrifices. Therefore, in late January, they attempted to disrupt or cut off Rabaul's supply lines, rashly sending excited troops to the central Pacific, invading Truk Island and Tinian, Saipan Island. However, the Japanese defense in this area was extremely solid, and the enemy air force suffered a severe blow from the Japanese Navy, and then changed direction, dispatching one hundred and several dozen or two hundred aircraft a day to attack Rabaul. In particular, recently, they not only bombed military facilities, but also carried out despicable acts of bombing the city streets. Subsequently, they landed in Torokina in western Bougainville Island, Magagi in southwestern New Britain Island, Sorol in northwestern New Britain Island, and Green Island in the ocean southeast of New Ireland Island. A portion of the enemy's forces also landed on a corner of the Admiralty Islands in the ocean north of New Britain Island at the end of February, taking a position to encircle Rabaul. These enemy forces are all engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>The Rabaul Fortress Stands Immovable</h3>
<p>The enemy's intention is to isolate Rabaul and prevent the Japanese from having time to counterattack through continuous bombing. However, the Japanese army never yields, using its small air force to intercept the enemy forces, while ground troops also unleash fierce fire, achieving results every day. Now, the area around Rabaul has not only become a major fortress, but is also fully prepared for a decisive battle. It has already built strong and unyielding mechanized positions and deployed land, sea, and air forces. In addition, with complete storage methods, it has accumulated sufficient weapons, ammunition, fuel, and food to last for several years. Moreover, since the end of last year, non-combatant civilian stores and companies have been relocated inland, and the commercial organizations of third-country nationals (mostly Chinese) and local residents, or farms and coconut groves for the purpose of local self-sufficiency in vegetables and fruits, have been taken over and managed by certain Japanese troops. Eliminating civilian colors, and adopting a single military color, to reorganize the decisive battle formation. No matter how fierce the bombing, the Japanese army has complete air defense facilities. (In addition to the complete installation of anti-aircraft artillery, there are underground concrete air-raid shelters, or cave shelters using mountain recesses. Except for the collapse of a few houses during air raids, the damage is negligible. In particular, it can be said that there are almost no casualties.) Therefore, the morale of the Japanese army is becoming more and more vigorous, and they are only waiting for the opportunity to counterattack.</p>
<h3>The Southern Line Urgently Needs More Aircraft</h3>
<p>What is the opportunity for a counterattack? It is when the Japanese air force is strong. Sending aircraft to the front line, this requirement is the supreme command. Aerial attrition warfare is a characteristic of the South Pacific battle line, so it can be said that everything depends on whether or not there is air supremacy. And it is determined by the number of aircraft. In this theater, because the air bases of both sides are within each other's bombing range, air supremacy can be said to only control the time of flight. And the time of flight is determined by the number of aircraft. Excellent Japanese aircraft and brave and unparalleled Japanese airmen with superb combat skills and an indomitable fighting spirit immediately deploy their wings and take off from their bases to intercept enemy forces when they come to attack. Each aircraft can kill several enemy aircraft each time. However, the attacking enemy aircraft, because their numbers exceed ours tenfold or twentyfold, even the worst American aircraft must be allowed to infiltrate Japanese airspace to some extent. Although the enemy is terrified of the bravery of the Japanese army, they often drop their bombs in a hurry and flee, or make excuses such as "bad weather" and often turn back midway. From this, we can also know the level of skill in the enemy's fighting spirit.</p>
<p>In the six naval air battles off Bougainville Island, and even in subsequent air combat results, everyone regretted saying: "If we had a few more aircraft, we could have annihilated the enemy fleet." Also, for example, enemy convoys were detected very early, but they could not be attacked and had to be allowed to pass, or the enemy's landing could not be completely prevented. All of this was partly due to the insufficient number of Japanese aircraft. So, how many aircraft are enough? However, for the next question, everyone should have doubts. Because the number of aircraft cannot be given a definite number. If the number of our aircraft is large, we will naturally need more. If the number of enemy aircraft is small, we can also need less. The required quantity is relative. We will only record the following example here. The number of enemy aircraft in the Solomon Islands area, deployed at the various air bases of Guadalcanal, New Georgia Island, Munda Island, Torokina, etc., totals one thousand to one thousand and two hundred combat and bomber aircraft, and they are deployed in four shifts. However, the number of Japanese aircraft is much less in comparison, and our tireless naval air force, without rotation, goes out to attack or intercept every day. We do not hope to have the same number of aircraft as the enemy. We will be satisfied with a certain number of attacks and defenses necessary for the number of enemy aircraft. The only thing necessary is a continuous supply. Because of their great production power, the enemy constantly strives to maintain a certain number of aircraft in the face of great daily losses. It is absolutely necessary for us to maintain a certain ratio to this. Even our brave and unparalleled air force sometimes suffers valuable sacrifices, or sometimes aircraft are damaged beyond repair due to air combat, bombing, etc. If we calculate one aircraft lost per day, we need thirty aircraft per month, and sixty aircraft in two months, so there must be a continuous supply.</p>
<h3>Enemy Women's Teams Participate in the War</h3>
<p>The rapid increase in production and aid for aircraft also requires the training of aircraft personnel. Regarding this matter, the government is already carefully considering various measures, and we also deeply believe in them. However, in this regard, there is only one issue that needs to be paid attention to: recently, enemy aircraft also include women participating in them. In addition to pilots, enemy large aircraft have women serving as communications officers, etc., and large aircraft tenders for rescuing pilots who land midway are manned by women, engaging in rescue work. It goes without saying that it is not surprising that frivolous and adventurous American women are on board aircraft. However, on the front lines amidst gunfire and bullets, even women can fulfill a role in aviation power. Looking at this fact, and in view of the current situation where it is hoped to increase the number of aviation personnel, is it not a question worth considering? The field of women's mobilization is not limited to factories, battle positions, or rural villages. At least in the vast field of aviation, other than the front line, in the so-called civilian air transportation in various regions, they can also replace men. Therefore, the field where women should contribute can be said to be broad and large.</p>
<h3>The Scientific Community Should Quickly Rise to Cooperate</h3>
<p>Finally, we must call on the scientific community to quickly mobilize and rise up. All fronts are concentrating on "weapon-mounted firearms", "wireless communication weapons", and "electromagnetic wave weapons", and are developing fierce scientific warfare, which is a well-known fact. In this theater, the progress and changes in science are worth staring at. Not only is the performance of one weapon being improved, but new weapons are appearing one after another. The development of the performance of enemy and our aircraft, compared to the beginning of the war, has been greatly improved. For example, for the firearms mounted on them, we have high-performance support, and there are great achievements in shooting down enemy aircraft. However, the enemy soon applied special defensive armor, so even higher-performance weapons are needed.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic waves have the most important mission as the vanguard of air warfare, or quickly discovering enemy ships, etc. However, yesterday's electromagnetic wave equipment is already old-fashioned today. In addition to airborne radar, there is now the emergence of sea radar, making submarine warfare increasingly fierce. Also, like bombs, the enemy has jumping torpedoes, and we have 〇〇 bombs, etc. New weapons are being sent out. Today, the necessity of the number of aircraft goes without saying. On the other hand, the invention of a new weapon can actually surpass the advantage in quantity, and has this kind of importance. Therefore, there is no opportunity other than now for the entire scientific camp to mobilize.</p>
<p>Now, the enemy is circling in the Pacific, sharpening their claws, adding importance to our inner line operations. However, the strategic position and value of Rabaul have not diminished. No, for its inner line operations, Rabaul can contain enemy fleets externally, or hold this place to the death, so that the enemy cannot obtain a single fleet base in this area, or, in the sense of giving a decisive battle "time", it can add other meanings. Therefore, the loyal and heroic Japanese army and navy generals and soldiers in Rabaul, in close communication and cooperation in the defensive posture, are burning with the belief and will to win, and are holding Rabaul to the death, and are watching for the opportunity for a fierce counterattack. Aviation will enable it to achieve this goal. The early strengthening of aviation power and the complete arming of science are one of its important things.

<h3>Southern Germany: A Pilgrimage to the New Industrial Zone</h3>
<p>A Cold Village Transformed into an Industrial City</p>
<p>The Bohemian and Moravian Protectorates in southern Germany have become a newly emerging industrial zone and have been going on for five years during the war. It has become more and more likely to follow the Ruhr region and become an arsenal for the Axis powers in Europe. The industrial cities in northern Germany have been damaged by Anglo-American air raids and have been replenished by industrial cities in the south. It goes without saying that existing industrial facilities are being expanded on a large scale; in terms of new construction, for example, cold villages whose names were not even known before the war have now been transformed into cities with a population of 50,000 to 80,000. The reason for this is to make tourists who revisit the old place be dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The new industrial zone has an unexpectedly large-scale coal liquefaction plant, various weapons factories, and small-scale ordnance factories that use natural terrain and are camouflaged to avoid air raids. The industrial departments of the former Czechoslovakia have also been added with new equipment, and industries during peacetime have been transformed into ordnance factories. The number of workers in the factory has doubled compared to before the attack, and there is naturally no one who is unemployed. Moreover, in terms of treatment, local workers have been completely equal to German workers since January of this year, and have obtained more favorable conditions than in the old republic era. This move is enough to prove the important position of the area in wartime industry.</p>
<p>The Rule of the Protectorate</p>
<p>In March 1939, after the German army entered the former Czechoslovakia, it divided the two provinces of Bohemia and Moravia into protectorates, which has now been five years. The only issue for Germany during this period is whether the German nation can coexist and prosper with other nations. If this problem can be satisfactorily resolved, then Germany can occupy a leading position in the new European order that includes all nations. Therefore, the merits of the Protectorate’s rule are a touchstone. However, Germany's policy towards the Czechs under protection does not make them Germanize, but respects their national characteristics and culture, and strives to support their survival and prosperity within Greater Germany.</p>
<p>Czechs are exempt from military service and enjoy the same rights as Germans. All but one of the members of the Protectorate government are Czechs, including the prime minister, most of whom are celebrities in the political and financial circles of the old republic era. Among the various types of officials, Czechs account for more than 10,000 people, while Germans account for only 500 people. Protectorate President Frick, on behalf of President Butler, resides in the position of President. The actual political and administrative guidance of the Protectorate government and the liaison with Greater Germany are handled by a small number of National officials led by Minister Frank of Bohemia and Moravia Province. The administrative system relies on a provincial double organization, and Germany is working hard to ensure the survival of the Czechs within Greater Germany. Regardless of the various difficulties in wartime, the thorough organization of health, social affairs, and culture in Germany has been fully developed and has achieved results. For example, although paper is in short supply, 9 million Czech books were still published last year, nearly 90% of the first part before the war. The newly established youth group, the Mo group, trains the spirit, preserves the characteristics of the Czech nation, and is full of life and vigor. This is clear proof that Germany treats different ethnic groups with a true brotherly relationship.</p>
<p>Pioneering the Way of Coexistence and Co-prosperity The anti-German conspiracies and terrorist acts of the Czechs were subdued after the assassination of Protectorate President Heydrich last year. Although they retreated on the eastern front, people's hearts are still extremely stable. The opportunity for national harmony and the attitude of striving to participate in the war can be seen everywhere. The signer once exchanged opinions without hesitation and synthesized what the ministers, financial leaders, and relatively sharp speakers of the Protectorate said, and came to a conclusion, that is, when Heydrich first took office in the Czech Republic, the Czechs generally thought that Heydrich was the henchman of Himmler, director of the German political police, and feared that he would implement harsh ethnic policies. In fact, in order to maintain public order, it is natural to adopt strict policies, but he did his best to respect the Czech national culture and life, especially to protect the rights of the Czech people to own and manage their property.</p>
<p>This is to make the Jewish capital equal in the Czech Republic, so that it becomes state-owned or even nationalized, but it does not move a bit to those owned by the Czechs. For example, the Czech Republic's largest arms factory, the Skoda factory, was later operated by the Hermann Göring Company. The Czech Republic government, which was anti-German before the war, sold most of the Skoda factory's shares to the French Schneider factory. After the war began, it was subject to enemy property disposal. Today, it still recognizes the shares held by the Czechs. Recently, it expanded the factory and increased its capital, and the new shares have been publicly listed.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Germany has embarked on the path of sharing and coexisting with other ethnic groups, and its internal unity has become more and more solid, which is a sign of a bright future. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun of April 5)</p>

<h3>Little Apricot</h3>
<p>— Qiong</p>
<p>The sun sets in the west, and the western sky is covered with colorful clouds. The clouds move lazily forward, and the tired birds know that it is time to return to their nests. The yellow cows in the square make a long, drawn-out moo, as if calling for their masters to come and lead them home. Smoke curls from the tops of the thatched cottages, and the people in the village are busy preparing dinner.</p>
<p>A string of clear songs floats in the evening breeze. Along with the songs, a lively little girl jumps out of the apricot blossom grove, about sixteen or seventeen years old. She has a face as beautiful as Zhaohua, especially her eyes, which are dark, bright, and lively, revealing her innocence. She sings as she jumps: "The sun is setting, the little lambs are going home! Mom is waiting for a kiss, kiss and go home to be with Mom!" She jumps farther and farther, and gradually this lively little shadow disappears into the dusk.</p>
<p>In front of a thatched cottage at the foot of the mountain stood a middle-aged woman, anxiously looking east, wringing her hands tightly. A lively little girl came running, and a comforting smile appeared on the woman's face.</p>
<p>"Mom, look, Zhang Gong gave me this." The little girl raised the meat in her hand high and said to her mother with a smile.</p>
<p>"Little Apricot! You're not young anymore, how can you still be like a wild child, running around outside all day? Look, Mom will find you a husband's family next year, and let them take good care of you."</p>
<p>A red cloud flew onto her cheeks, and Little Apricot lowered her head in shame, but she was secretly happy in her heart, because usually when she saw her younger sisters get married, her mother would always make them some beautiful clothes. Little Apricot, she loves to wear beautiful clothes the most, but her family has no money, and her father passed away early, and all she can rely on is her mother to do some needlework to earn some money to live on. Now that life is expensive, she can't even afford to eat, so where can she have extra money to make clothes for Little Apricot, so she only dreams that one day when she gets married, her mother will make her many beautiful clothes.</p>
<p>The days passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, the autumn harvest had passed, and every household was preparing grain, waiting for the grain collectors to come and take it away. Little Apricot's family also had some debts to pay to a Lin Lord in the city, but they had neither the property left by Little Apricot's father nor fields to cultivate, so they had no savings at all. The money they earned on weekdays was only enough to cover their daily expenses, so Little Apricot's mother was always frowning and silent these past few days. Little Apricot was no longer as happy and carefree as she used to be. She knew that something embarrassing was about to happen to them. She hoped that Lord Lin would forget about this matter and not come to force her to repay the 300 yuan. But things couldn't be so simple. Three days later, the debt collector came. He said fiercely to Little Apricot's mother that she must hand over 300 yuan today, otherwise, he would drive them out and not allow them to live in this house anymore. Little Apricot's mother pleaded bitterly, but this person pretended to be deaf, as if he hadn't heard anything. Just at this moment, Little Apricot borrowed some rice from next door and came back. When she saw a guest in the study, she hurriedly flashed into the kitchen, but she had already been seen by the guest. His pair of thief eyes stared at Little Apricot for a long time, and then nodded thoughtfully, and then said to Little Apricot's mother: "I have seen that your family is very poor. I have always been a loyal and honest person. When I know that people are suffering, I will help them. Now, look, I will throw this contract into the stove and burn it." After saying that, he crumpled the contract into a ball and threw it into the stove to burn. Little Apricot's mother shed tears of gratitude, thanking the debt collector repeatedly and then respectfully sending him away. That night, the two mothers and daughters talked very happily, saying that it was the blessing of the ancestors that they were able to accumulate so much good karma, so the debt collector would burn the contract. Who knew that good times would not last long, and misfortune would soon follow. The next morning, the debt collector came again. He told Little Apricot's mother that Lord Lin had heard that her daughter was very beautiful, so he wanted to marry her as his fourth concubine. At the same time, he would give Little Apricot's mother 500 yuan and a pair of gold bracelets as a betrothal gift, and he was scheduled to come and marry her in five days. Little Apricot's mother was about to speak, but the man had already run away. Little Apricot's mother had no choice but to take the bracelets and money to tell Little Apricot. When Little Apricot found out, she didn't eat or do anything, and cried all day long. She said that she would rather die than go to be Lord Lin's concubine. Little Apricot's mother, of course, didn't want her precious daughter to be ravaged by Lord Lin. But there was no way, people were rich and powerful, and she was so poor, so what if she didn't agree? Five days later, a colorful palanquin took Little Apricot away. Although she cried and struggled and refused to go, she finally succumbed. She let these people blow and beat her away</p>
<p>It was another dusk, a spring dusk. The evening breeze was blowing gently, shaking the leaves on the tree branches and the tender grass on the ground. Next to the apricot blossom grove rose a new grave, and several lonely wildflowers grew on the grave, swaying as if they were about to fall when the breeze blew. A woman came from afar, staggering to the grave, staring blankly. Suddenly, she cried loudly: "Little Apricot! In the end, you were ruined!"</p>
<p>Cuckoos cried mournfully on the tree. The setting sun shone on this whole village, on this dirt grave, and also on this woman—(she still stood foolishly, without moving.) She had fainted to the ground.</p>
<h3>A Distant Journey</h3>
<p>— Xin Yi</p>
<p>I seem destined to live a life of constant motion. Day and night, I kick the earth behind me, entering another new realm, briefly glancing around, and then stepping out again. It's truly a long journey! Yet, I neither complain that I'm too free, nor do I want my two legs to stop. It's as if we glimpse a black [unclear character] suddenly streaking across the sky; what we see is its posture of flapping wings and striving to fly, and in the blink of an eye, it has disappeared into the vast sky. This image tells me, and also amazes me, that I truly don't know when it will want to stop. I myself can't help but do the same. I understand that I'm constantly walking, but I don't know what kind of image my ceaseless stride leaves behind, what image I project into the eyes of others.</p>
<p>And I am indeed bewitched by the unfinished journey. The "future" is always something yet unknown, and I harbor a particularly strong desire and curiosity for things I don't know. Though what is strange is that when I truly taste it, I can't help but immediately discard it, and then begin to gaze vaguely ahead. There, there are still things I don't know. Thus, I abandon the past—I am always so lost. Of course, I haven't created a schedule or plan for my life's journey. It's that, and I can't draw one up. This reason, the rushing water perhaps knows. Try asking it, but when you hesitate for even a moment, it rushes forward without the slightest attachment, carrying a head that doesn't turn back—who knows where it's rushing to? It's just like that.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I see those white clouds rapidly streaming across the sky, the dawns and sunsets retreating like fugitives under the evening sun, so hasty, even jostling and bumping into each other, I almost suspect that the North and South Poles are drawing closer. And these images flash in my heart, and my heart is also enlarged several times by the surging torrent, accommodating more of heaven and earth. This is to say, I want to walk even further. Those borders? They're just like a slight edge rippling out from a point of blue scattered in the water's reflection, faint, elusive, and gradually dissipating. This should be worrying, but I don't know that the point of blue is still mixed in the water, it's just—unable to be found. I'm always like this. How vast is the heaven and earth in my heart, how distant is the journey, and yet, I who have embarked on the journey, seem so small, almost dissolving into this world and disappearing there, there! But this is irrelevant to me. In a world of "reality," what does it matter if something disappears?</p>
<p>If I like to laugh, then I laugh at those "fake" people living in "reality"; if I hate, then I hate those who don't even pretend to smile after turning their faces; if I grieve, then I grieve for those who don't know the fundamental elements of their own lives; and if I curse, then I only curse those whose lives are calculated like abacus beads. But this is just talk. How could I possibly feel happy? How could such a long journey give me a moment of leisure!</p>
<p>This is how I think: the future is accidental, the past is inevitable, and the present is adaptation. Everyone will properly and directly step on the road they stand on, even if it's as rugged as the steam rising. But in short, all of this is irrelevant to me. What's important is that I still have such a long, such a distant journey to travel!</p>
<h3>Soprano Singer Ms. Mao Aili</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Those who have lived in the North probably have a considerable understanding of Ms. Mao Aili! In the past three years, she has held public recitals every year in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places. The characteristic of her singing voice is that it is rich in emotion, and also broad and bright. Listen! When she sings Li Qingzhao's lyrics "Slow, Slow Tune," her face, her voice, are exactly like the fourteen words in the poem: "Searching, searching, seeking, seeking, desolate, desolate, bleak, bleak, sorrowful, sorrowful, wretched, wretched, painful, painful," full of sorrow and holding back tears; but when she sings the song "Early Happiness," who isn't moved to dance and be joyful? Whose mood isn't light and happy?</p>
<p>Success is never accidental. Ms. Mao Aili's family environment is an extremely good place for cultivating musical talent. Her home is in Qingdao, and her father is a violinist. It is said that when Miss Aili was only four years old, she had already learned the lyrics of Su San from records: "Su San left Hongtong County, and came to the front of the street..." a segment of "Western Tune Flowing Water," if that were in an ordinary family, perhaps it would be considered commonplace and not remarkable, but her esteemed father did not think so. He was not only amazed by her talent, but also happy with her interest. Now he had a daughter to inherit the family skill. So he sent Miss Aili to school step by step, and in her spare time, he imparted knowledge of professional cultivation. These are the essential elements for nurturing that young seedling to grow. When she grew up, she was admitted to the Department of Music at Yenching University, majoring in vocal music. She had repeatedly served as the solo part in the grand chorus of "Messiah" and "Creation," earning high praise from composers. Afterwards, she returned to Qingdao to hold several recitals, thus establishing her position in the music world. In the spring of the year before last, she suddenly left her family and bid farewell to her old friends, gracefully coming to Shanghai to study under Professor Su Shilin. For two years, she has learned some of the essence of Professor Su Shilin and become one of Su's most satisfied disciples.</p>
<p>How many languages does one need to know to study vocal music? It's difficult to answer this question. It's not like studying science or literature, where mastering one or two languages allows you to read many books. Learning to sing is different. Singers don't have nationalities. We heard the members of the former Dong Sai Dance Troupe sing Chinese songs when they came to Shanghai, which were gentle and melodious. Similarly, Ms. Aili is the same. She often sings English "Creation," Italian opera, German Schubert songs, and the pronunciation principles of Japanese lyrics all come from the same source.</p>
<p>What is Ms. Mao Aili like in her daily life? Two short phrases can be used to answer this: [unclear character], straightforward, is her natural disposition; talent, hard work, are the reasons for her success. You can spot her on Yu Garden Road around 8 o'clock in the morning, riding a bicycle and speeding westward like lightning, rushing to class at St. John's. Even now, she constantly practices singing every day, learning new and reviewing old, which takes up most of her time. In addition, rouge and brocade seem to have no attractive power for her.</p>
<p>On the 25th and 26th of this month, she will hold another recital. The venue is at the Great China and Guanzhong Grand Theaters. The purpose of this performance is nothing more than to conduct further experimentation. She often says that learning is endless. There are naturally more people in Shanghai who appreciate music than in the Tianjin and Jin areas. She hopes that after this performance, the audience can give her some practical criticism to serve as a guide for future improvement. This statement is unavoidably overly modest, but for those living in Shanghai, having the opportunity to listen to her singing voice is indeed a piece of good news worth celebrating.</p>
<p>Counting the days, it's almost here. Let us bless her health and success with a sincere heart! Bless her health and success!</p>
<h3>Mourning a Departed Friend</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Spring rain falls continuously</p>
<p>It is the Qingming season</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>Cannot see the clear sky after the rain</p>
<p>Nor the sun rising</p>
<p>You painfully left this world</p>
<p>Having lived a quarter of a century</p>
<p>You struggled with pulmonary tuberculosis for ten years</p>
<p>You coughed up blood</p>
<p>But still had to get up and work</p>
<p>For the sake of three meals of white rice</p>
<p>Alas</p>
<p>The fresh blood exhausted the last drop</p>
<p>You refused to waste a single moment</p>
<p>You refused to squander a single penny</p>
<p>You never planned for your personal gain</p>
<p>Not even a fraction of a cent</p>
<p>Wealth was not your friend</p>
<p>Poverty was your confidante</p>
<p>In this era of hardship</p>
<p>How much torment did you endure</p>
<p>Your personal aspirations could not be realized</p>
<p>And family separation was added</p>
<p>Two sisters are in the West</p>
<p>The third brother wanders to the South</p>
<p>The fourth brother is seriously ill in the North</p>
<p>Mother spends her twilight years in her hometown</p>
<p>In the hospital</p>
<p>Your profound eyes</p>
<p>Your thin face</p>
<p>How many friends felt anxious and heartbroken</p>
<p>But alas, for what</p>
<p>No one could stay by your side</p>
<p>No one could reverse this crisis</p>
<p>Before you died</p>
<p>You still wielded your pen</p>
<p>You told us not to sigh</p>
<p>But to work even harder</p>
<p>Yes, we will always remember your words</p>
<p>May you rest in peace</p>

<h3>Farewell, Northern Star, Safe Travels! Reviewing Six Matches in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Northern Star basketball expedition from North China boasts an impressive lineup. The people of Shanghai, craving the artistry of Northern basketball, were overjoyed, and each match drew a tidal wave of spectators. The atmosphere was heated, and the occasion unprecedented. Over the team’s six matches in Shanghai, they first suffered defeats at the hands of the Western Youth and the Hualian Pharmaceutical teams. By the match against Zhongbei, the players gradually regained their normal form, resulting in a tie. Subsequently, during an exhibition, they defeated Huaying. Finally, they accepted the challenge from Western Youth for two matches. Thanks to the help of teammates Zhao Yalin and Li Baozhong, and the support of Li Zhenzhong, their strength greatly increased. In the first match, the soldiers gave their all, putting on a wonderful performance, and indeed made the “barbarians” bow. In the second match, it was intended to follow up with a sweeping victory, but since Chuan Jinsheng's foot injury had not yet healed, the team was greatly affected, resulting in unfulfilled ambition and causing much regret. A retrospective review of the six matches follows:</p>
<p>First Match, Unfamiliar Style</p>
<p>The Northern Star team's first match in Shanghai was held on April 10 at the YMCA gymnasium on Ba Xian Qiao, facing the Shanghai Western mixed team. The crowding of the audience was beyond description. The admiration of the fans for Northern basketball style was profound indeed. Northern Star had six players present, with Shao Weigang as backup. At the beginning of the match, both sides buried themselves in hard work, with no tactical display, only individual performance. Therefore, the first half was extremely tense, with the Western mix team winning by only two points, 14 to 12. In the second half, both sides had military advisors to give advice. The Westerners used superior tactics, while Northern Star remained the same, blindly charging forward, so they allowed the opposing team to lead from the start, unable to catch up later, and ultimately lost to the Western mix team by 21 to 30. An unfavorable start, which the commentators regretted. The reason for this was that the Western mix team was able to attack the opponent's weaknesses, while Northern Star ultimately failed to adapt, which was a shortcoming.</p>
<p>Second Match, Still the Same</p>
<p>The second match was against the Shanghai Chinese league champion, the Hualian Pharmaceutical basketball team. Hualian Pharmaceutical's combat strategy was much the same as the Western mix team’s. At the beginning of the game, the Northern Star team relied on their superior individual skills to fight the Southern force, dividing the court and confronting each other. The situation was quite shocking. Hualian Pharmaceutical ultimately used fancy moves. Xi Lin and Jin Xuan scored with every shot. The first half ended with a score of 16 to 11. In the second half, Northern Star tried hard to change its strategy, using more brain and less brawn. Northern Star did not notice, resulting in Hualian Pharmaceutical, with its many tricks, easily gaining victory. The score was 31 to 26. Judging by the close score, it can be seen that Northern Star was not incapable of winning. However, they only knew how to attack and not how to defend. Facing a strong enemy like this, failure was inevitable. In this match, Chuan Jinsheng's individual performance was indeed exceptionally brilliant, earning much applause.</p>
<p>Third Match, Gradually Returning to Normal</p>
<p>The expeditionary force faced the Shanghai North [unclear character] patriarch Zhongbei team, still at the Ba Xian Qiao Youth Association. The court was even more lively than the previous two matches because of the two Northern factions competing. In this match, both teams paid attention to fast attacks after getting the ball, and neglected strict defense. This was originally a matter of style, but also because they showed courtesy to each other. However, Zhongbei ultimately had deeper experience, winning the first half with a score of 26 to 1 [unclear character]. In the second half, the Northern Star players suddenly seemed to recover. Team leader Fan Qinggong became active, shedding the affectation of the previous two matches, and scoring with every shot. Chang Ying's center also gradually showed ease in advancing and retreating, and his posture when dribbling the ball was particularly well displayed in this match, which was admirable. The result of the match was 49 to 49, a draw. Because it was friendly in nature, both sides agreed not to extend the game, shook hands, and made peace. Northern Star was gradually recovering to its normal form.</p>
<p>Fourth Match, Initial Victory</p>
<p>This match was played in conjunction with the Huaying Sports Association, at the company's court, which was a hard court. Commentators said that the Northern basketball team was more accustomed to mud courts, so they could display their power, but I dare not casually deny this. However, the Northern Star team members themselves firmly believed that the floor and the dirt ground were no different. In order to consolidate its strength, Huaying specially invited national player Li Zhenzhong to help, so as not to let the battle situation be one-sided, but as a result, the expeditionary force ultimately won with a superior move. After arriving in Shanghai, they achieved their first victory, 44 to 32, which was quite close. Huaying focused on the get-together. In addition to the ceremonies hosted by actresses Zhou Manhua and Hu Feng, they also presented valuable souvenirs to the Northern athletes, and the atmosphere was unique. During the get-together, the exchange was a sincerity rarely seen in the sports world.</p>
<p>Fifth Match, Famous Generals Assist</p>
<p>The team received special attention from the Western Youth authorities, who sincerely challenged them. However, they were afraid that it would be difficult to deal with the enemy's frequent use of clever tactics when their strength was inferior. Therefore, old members Li Shizhong and Zhao Yalin (now affiliated with Zhongbei, previously both members of the Northern Star team) decided to help out and join the team, and invited Li Zhenzhong to join, in order to provide assistance. Sure enough, with the gathering of Northern masters, Western Youth, although still plotting for victory, could not avoid defeat. Moreover, the location of the match was at the Western Youth Association, where the enemy had the advantage of terrain. This also shows the preciousness of Northern Star's victory. In terms of argument, the assistance of Zhenzhong was a major reason. And Chang Ying's sudden burst of luck and hitting every shot was also a major key. The result was 41 to 38. Judging by the score, it was quite dangerous, which can be inferred without saying. In short, this battle can be called a successful battle.</p>
<p>Sixth Match, Exhausted</p>
<p>After the defeat, Western Youth was unwilling to accept it and invited Northern Star again. Northern Star, with only two days left before leaving Shanghai, could not refuse the invitation and resolutely agreed. In fact, after several battles, they inevitably gradually showed signs of exhaustion, while Western Youth ultimately waited at their leisure. Therefore, in the first half, Northern Star was still able to fight with their backs to the wall, leading by one point with a score of 15 to 14. Afterwards, they lacked sufficient effort, so how could they win? They only saw mental and physical exhaustion, and all efforts were in vain. Western Youth was able to manipulate victory, reversing the defeat with a score of 38 to 31, and Northern Star ultimately lost.</p>
<p>Technical Criticism of Each Player</p>
<p>In summary, Northern Star had two wins, one draw, and three losses in their six matches in Shanghai. Although the record was not outstanding, the whole team was full of energy, their attacks were like lightning, clear and beautiful. Looking around Shanghai, no one could surpass them. They were also able to pay close attention to sportsmanship, which was particularly valuable and worthy of emulation by all players. As for the criticism of individual techniques, I will describe them in turn:</p>
<p>Fan Qinggong——As the forward, his shooting [unclear character] is indeed remarkable. Being on the scene is quite [unclear character], before the forward, and the shot is also skilled, being the scoring pivot of the whole team. This gentleman is</p>
<p>Chuan Jinsheng——is the best forward, and his shooting is also skillful, being the scoring key of the whole team. This gentleman is young and strong, and his future is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Chang Ying——served as the center in several matches in Shanghai this month, advancing and retreating quickly, with a beautiful dribbling posture. It is believable that his basics are superb and worthy of appreciation. However, he is often seen at a loss at critical moments and shows panic.</p>
<p>Guo Yaosong——With his strong physique, he is the most standard material for a defender, and is incomparably brave. His shortcoming is that he is brave but lacks planning.</p>
<p>Guo Yongen——It is said that he serves as the center in Beiping, but he serves as the defender more often in Shanghai. He is good in all aspects, but he often defends less and attacks more, revealing loopholes. Perhaps it is because he is not used to serving as a defender?</p>
<p>Zhao Weiguan——Performed extremely wholeheartedly in Shanghai, so I dare not offer criticism.</p>
<p>Farewell, Northern Star</p>
<p>In short, the team's individual skills are quite remarkable, but the whole team lacks research on tactics. The "man-to-man" defense is not very effective. Once a strong enemy is in front of them, they only know how to fight desperately, and fail to adapt. This is probably because the Northern style of play sticks to conventions, and the environment makes it so. This trip to the South is a lesson. They should bring back the strengths of the South to the North, and carefully ponder them. Then, the stones of other mountains can be used to polish jade. The magic of application lies in one's heart. Reaching the peak can be foreseen. As the saying goes, "If a scholar is separated for three months, one should look at him with new eyes." If they come back again another day, and show their skills again, I know that they will be able to refresh the vision of the people of Chongqing. Encourage them! Encourage them!</p>
<p>Now the expeditionary force, the Northern Star, is scheduled to leave Shanghai today. Singing a song, when will they come again? Farewell, Northern Star, farewell, athletes of the North! Safe travels! Take care of yourselves!</p>
<h3>My Opinion on the Northern Star Team</h3>
<p>— Yu Xunzi</p>
<p>In recent years, the participants in the Shanghai basketball games have all been the teams that are used to playing and are hot, and after watching for a long time, the offensive and defensive techniques of each team are well known to each other. The Northern Star team's expedition to Shanghai has given the Shanghai teams a good opportunity to learn from each other, and the atmosphere has been renewed. Although the team lost two and drew one in its first three games in Shanghai, heroes cannot be judged by temporary success or failure. The team's technical aspects are quite valuable. Let's discuss its strengths and weaknesses and use them for [unclear character]. I will express what I see as [unclear character].</p>
<p>The Battle of Western Youth</p>
<p>On that day, the Western Youth team's performance was not as pure and hot as it was in the Western Youth League before. Except for the two defenders, Brett and Othel Liao, who played more outstandingly, the rest seemed a little rusty. Why could the Northern Star still not win? It was because their offensive and defensive abilities were still not as good as the Western Youth team. The Northern Star's defense method is to use man-to-man defense as king, but its application is not yet effective, often allowing the opponent to take advantage of gaps. Western Youth wins its attacks by blocking, and Northern Star cannot quickly change and shift its position to prevent the opponent's attack. And the rebounding under the basket is often won by Western Youth, making Western Youth's opportunities to shoot under the basket far more than Northern Star's. The Northern Star's offensive method is to use fast-speed passing to allow two back attackers to sneak attack. Although the five people cooperate with considerable tacit understanding, Western Youth's man-to-man defense method is the champion of all teams in Shanghai. In this situation, the Northern Star did not know how to use obstruction or pivot to break it, so it could not penetrate the bottom of the basket and ultimately lost.</p>
<p>The Battle of Hualian</p>
<p>The Northern Star team still used man-to-man defense, while Hualian used a 3-2 style five-man joint defense. Hualian could also not use the obstruction or pivot method to attack. However, relying on its pure and hot connection, lightning-style attack, and familiarity with the venue, it was able to win. At the beginning of the game, the Northern Star forward rushed back to the middle line to receive the ball, then passed it to the defender to sneak attack the basket. The method was excellent. Unfortunately, the use of this [unclear character] tactic was very brief, and afterwards they often wandered outside the opponent's defensive zone, passing back and forth, so that the ball could not penetrate the enemy's formation, which greatly reduced the chances of shooting. Looking at the second half, the ball was passed to the Hualian basket every time, and the back-turning shot method was used to shoot, which made many great achievements, which can be known. With the Northern Star players' physique and jumping height, the Hualian two guards could not stop this type of shooting. It is a pity that this method was not used more in the first half, which was the main reason for their inability to win. When the ball is passed to the shooting area and there is no one to obstruct it, it must be shot. This is the key to shooting. However, the Northern Star team often does not shoot when it is in this area, but continues to pass, which leads to repeated loss of good shooting opportunities. In the last three minutes of the battle, the Northern Star fought with a tight pressing man-to-man defense, trying to recover the decline, but it still failed to work, but gave Hualian the opportunity to attack with lightning, leading to defeat.</p>
<p>The Dispute of Zhongbei</p>
<p>The absence of Zhongbei players Zhao Yalin and Li Zhongbei from the game caused the team's strength to be greatly reduced. However, the Northern Star still could not win because of this, which was really unexpected. Zhongbei's 3-2 joint defense attacked far faster than Northern Star. The Northern Star is known for its lightning warfare tactics, but it did not show its skills in this battle, giving the opponent a chance to return to defense. The battle was the most dull of the three battles. At the beginning of the game, Northern Star used a 2-1-2 style joint defense method. After five minutes on the field, they still changed to the man-to-man method. When Northern Star used the joint defense method, the location was not appropriate, and the movement was not flexible, making it easy for Zhongbei to penetrate the basket. In this battle, the Northern Star's shooting was mostly long-range shots. On the other hand, Zhongbei's scoring was mostly shooting under the basket. Later, the Northern Star's back attacker Guo Yongen reduced the attack, greatly affected. That night, the Northern Star's attack was greatly affected. That night, the Northern Star's entire team made more mistakes in cooperation than in the previous two battles, so even though Zhongbei's lineup was incomplete, it was still able to seize the whole game, making it impossible for Northern Star to win.</p>
<p>Looking at the three battles, the Northern Star generals can run and jump well, and the speed and accuracy of pushing the [unclear character] ball with both hands in front of the chest, and the agility of rushing forward to press the ball, are unmatched by the Shanghai team. Personal skills are also mostly above water, but the team's offensive methods seem to be outdated. As for sportsmanship and fighting spirit, they are mostly worthy of emulation. The two back attackers' sneak attacks are amazing and their skills are the crown of the entire team. It is a pity that they have not been able to use the defensive methods properly. Those who defend the blue must face the enemy's back basket and form a straight line. In other words, make the enemy walk the outer circle, and I retreat and walk the inner circle, and use [unclear character] as the center point. The Northern Star team's defense is that every time the enemy rushes forward, they turn around and follow the enemy, falling behind the enemy instead. At the same time, their defensive zone seems to be too lacking, often allowing the enemy to escape and rush to the basket to shoot, which is the weakest point of their defense. If the team uses the method of "the enemy advances, I retreat, the enemy retreats, I advance", when the enemy gets the ball, they face the defender, making it impossible to shoot, and making the shooting area without [unclear character] to take advantage of, then the other side will not be easy to attack. When attacking, there is no suitable way to break the enemy's five-man joint defense or man-to-man defense. In my opinion, every team must have two extremely defensive methods, such as the five-man joint defense or man-to-man methods, depending on the enemy's offensive situation, and adapt accordingly. If the other side is good at using the obstruction method to attack, then use the five-man joint defense method to deal with it. If the enemy is not good at attacking with the obstruction method, then it is appropriate to deal with it with the man-to-man method. The style of the two defensive methods can only be created when attacking, which is also necessary to break the enemy's defensive methods and become a top-notch team. With the Northern Star athletes' physique, strength, and personal agility, coupled with good guidance and improved offensive and defensive methods, they will become a strong enemy for the Shanghai teams.</p>
<h3>Sports Miscellany</h3>
<p>The Minli Girls' Middle School has a history of achievements in sports, especially volleyball. For example, Zhu Shifang and Huang Xingfen have both represented China in the Far East Games. The school's director of physical education, Mr. Zhang Juefei, is even more of an advocate. The newly established basketball team has already achieved considerable results. The players Xiao Ying, Sheng Jingshu, Zhuang Jinmu are all lively and agile, not inferior to ordinary veterans. I say that if they come out to compete, they will surely expand our horizons.</p>
<p>Football matches are most supported by fans, but because of the enthusiasm and passion, the authorities have already contacted the racecourse for the competition. Then, the lessons of the past are still vivid in my mind. I deeply hope that the authorities will plan in detail. The most important thing, I think, is to count the votes, increase the police force, and set up more entrances and ticket windows, and so on. So that the situation of [unclear character] encirclement will no longer reappear at the racecourse, and it is fortunate that the competition does not have a stadium.</p>
