<p>社評</p>
<h3>敬告女同胞</h3>
<p>我國大儒顧焱武先生所說『天下興亡匹夫有責」，確乎是至理各言，値得吾人拳拳格的僅指男子而言，理當以「個人」作爲詮釋，而包括女子在內。</p>
<p>女子之思想行動，足以影響家庭，亦即足以影響共丈與子女。是故敬姜相夫興國，孟母敎子成名，此外如居禮夫人之盡瘁科學，種種前例，　資矜式者，不一而足·反其責任。蓋近代戰爭乃全面戰爭，斷非半數之男子，所能負此全責。試將各交戰國對於女子之期待與責望，略加檢討，以資借鏡。</p>
<p>日本日禾對於征兵及勞働之年齡限界，均較他國爲實。最近爲實施「決戰非常措置要綱」起見，內政方面，亦會有顯著之活潑。遂於三月干八日閣議中，決定强化女子挺身隊制度方策。其目的在使凡滿十二歲以上四十歲以下之獨身女子，依其職業與地域之不同，分別組成女子挺身隊，於今後一年中從事於適合女子特性之業務，積極向增强戰力之生產方面邁進。此項措施與一般之徵用固有差別，但究爲擴大女子勤勞之組繳，使一般女子應時局之需要基於愛國心而自發的協助增產。今臼本報所載東京中央社電，日本全國工廠正盡夜努力於飛機之增產，而女子挺身隊亦出動工作，尤値注意。</p>
<p>德國德國於一九三五年三月十六日公佈「兵役法」，得徵集十八歲至四十五歲之男子。復於一九三九年九月二十二日公佈「學生學徒配置令」，規定十六歲以上男女生徒在農忙期內之動員措置。今年一月二十七日又公佈「戰時勞務巾請令」，對於十六歲至六十五歲之男子及十七歲至四十五歲之女子，課以向所屬勞動局申請之義務。</p>
<p>蘇聯蘇聯於一九三九年九月一日公佈「兵役法」，規定十八歲至五十歲之男子徵集爲現役。此外並規定十九歲至五十歲之女子而有持殊技能者，項向陸海軍登記而編入第二預備役。再據「勞働法」，規定微用年齡限界，男子爲十六歲至五十九歲，女子爲十六歲至五十四歲·在補助勞働方面，甚或徵及十二歲之靑年男女。</p>
<p>英國敵英於一九三九年九月三日公佈「國民皆兵法」，對於足十八歲至不足四十一歲之男子，課以徵兵之義務。同年九月五臼公佈「國民登記法」，對於足二十一歲至六十五歲之勞働者，課以登記之義務。旋於一九四一年十一月將登記範圍改變爲男子自十八歲至五十一歲而女子自十八歲至四十歲，並强制徵用二十一歲至三十一歲之女子</p>
<p>美國敵美於一九四〇年九月十六日起施行「選擇徵兵法」，規定自二十一歲至三十六歲之男子予以登記實施軍事訓練。次年即將此年齡限制擴大爲十八歲至六十五歲。最近按戰時人的資源委員會長波爾麥克納得所發表，根據奧斯金華滋華斯案，女子年齡之在十八歲以上五十歲以下者，亦須强行登記並有被國家徵用之義務。</p>
<p>綜上以觀，可知戰時各國對於女子之要求實不亞於男子，徒以其體力關係，在年齡限界上及工作性質上，容有差別耳。幸我國上之女子，鑒於國際情況，國內處境，對於男女平等之眞詮，加以反復深究，而明自處之道，否則自擠於妾　奴婢供人玩弄而猶洋洋得意，其愚可憫，至於助長社會之黑暗與墮落，不論其爲有心與無意，其罪可誅。觀夫他國女子所佔之地位與擔負之工作，一般紅指紅　燙髮之女子日以麻將跳舞看戲爲務者，當作如何感想。</p>
<p>望我女同胞從今日起，立志振拔，有則改之，無則加勉·並記取「天下興亡匹「婦」有實」之言。</p>
<h3>哥希馬西方地區　日機隊轟炸敵陣　伊姆法爾敵守軍已呈疲乏</h3>
<p>仰光十七日中央社電臼陸軍戰鬥機，十四日　惡劣天氣，擊退蠢動之敵戰鬥機羣，毅然對哥希馬西方茲普薩附近之敵砲兵陣地加以猛襲，突破敵防空彈冪，作激烈之俯衝轟炸，投彈悉命中敵砲兵陣地及集中於該地附近之車輛羣，予以潰滅打擊。於空戰中，更擊落其高速度轟炸機二架，是役日機一架未返基地。又是日會有戰鬥機羣來襲中部緬甸某地區，當經日軍迎擊，擊落其P51型機八架（內三架未證實），日機一架未返基地。</p>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電據康提來電，東南亞洲軍司令部十六日發表，日機隊對於緬甸北部摩肯溪谷布陣中之美軍以及渝軍加以轟炸，所受損害頗大。</p>
<p>仰光十七臼中央社電伊姆法爾要塞圍內抵抗月餘之敵軍，近旬日來，已呈疲乏及動搖之狀。按敵軍之意圖，本澦備於於伊姆法爾與日軍對峙至雨季降臨止，蓋敵軍以爲日軍之攻勢將因雨季而受限制之故也，因此，其間敵軍遂以優秀之空軍從事空中補給工作，以期增强戰力及實施反攻，至現在止，敵軍支持抵抗力之最大要素，係依賴不斷由空中運撤兵員及物力，此種方法，實不啻予敵軍對兵員以精神上之活力。按空中補給須受種種條件左右，其效力遠　於陸上運輸補給，因此，印緬國境方面於雨季來後，其空中補給工作將受極大影響。現在敵實之空中補給工作，因於白畫恐遭受日機之戰擊，故不得已遂於夜間或拂曉實施，然夜間或拂曉實爲雨勢最猛烈之際，因此雨季降臨後，則空中補給工作即適遇最大之困難，而日軍則不同，因日軍業已確保地上補給路，故雖至雨季，仍可進行對英印第四軍之殲滅戰‘今敵軍自恃以一年半之長時間所構築之堅固陣地及一千輛左右之坦克車，裝甲車及數百門震砲，並依賴空中之補給，以期繼續抵抗，然雨季到來後，將使敵人感到補給工作斷絕之危機。同時再加日軍之猛攻，則敵人必將陷於窘境中，故彼等防衛伊姆法爾之信心，必生動搖。</p>
<h3>全工廠畫夜努力　日飛機產量倍增　女挺身隊出動工作勤勞</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電當茲決戰期中，亞洲十億民族所最關心者，厥爲增强足可壓倒殲滅敵力航空兵力之優秀航空兵。昭和十九年度之飛機生產址，必須達成十八年度之數倍增產，全國工廠刻正不分畫夜，一致展開增產運動，致使飛機產量時刻增加。日本之飛機生產，自側重於超重點生產以來，業經年餘，飛機生產量逐月激增，此一年間頗多增產數倍者，同時先後製成具有優秀性能之新銳機。試觀某工廠之生產指數，此一年間工員一人之生產已增數倍，一方因工員人數亦行增加，該工廠之總生產額已增至若干倍，此不僅爲日飛機工業生產激增之一例耳。茲再說明此數字內容如次：　最惹人注目者，厭爲一人之生產額增至若干倍之點，此生產額乃以工員人數平均分担生產品之金額者，並非因在此一年間提高公定價格提漲所致。公定價格甚有减落者，其原因有三。第一，生產設備業已正式整備。第二，體同生產設備之整備，於作業管理上己有甚大改善，並行大量减低工數生產所需時間。此外，軍當局力期統一機刑或力謀使之單純化，更對製品之檢查水準加以合理調整。第三，工員勤勞能力之昂揚最堪注目，無論職員，工員皆於「敢死隊員」全員玉碎之旗幟下，挺身突擊，期達成生產之預定目標。其次尤堪注目者，工員一人之生產額固已增加，同時工員人數亦增加數倍，然一年間以八成至十成之驚人此率所增加之工員，幾全非熟練工，猶非經騐工，乃對飛機工業全爲門外漢，新應徵士或爲女子工員及女子挺身隊，且新應徽士之平均年齡，於此一年間，亦顯著增高。此事實概可暗示以下兩點，即日木之飛機工業，今日洵有極大之進步發展，刻已自搖驚期一躍而至壯年期。其次應注意之事項，厥爲工員一人之生產額，今後尙有幾多增加之餘地，飛機工廠方面最惹注目，即女子挺身隊之出動。以實際工作情形言之，機體製造部門占工員之若干成，發動機製作部門亦皆以女子代替，女子挺身隊之出動，在數的方面，雖僅爲端諾之形態，然其旺盛之動勞意志與不劣於男子鬥魂，實堪嘉許。</p>
<h3>日郵政儲額　超出二百億</h3>

<h3>重慶軍隊　染美國色彩　自主地位自甘墮落</h3>
<p>廣州十七日中央社電　重慶之對日抗戰信念，自去年開羅會談後，隨太平洋戰局之激烈進展，亦日益加强。故於大陸反攻第一錢，以及東南部對日空輸基地軍事力之充實，已謀求甚久。然於此次瞬息即歸潰滅，對日反攻作戰基地，已被粉碎。於茲對具美國色彩之渝軍實堪注目，誠以對日反攻主幹之重慶軍之訓練及裝備，完全美國化，步兵學校，砲兵學校，均聘美國顧問，開始各種幹部人員之養成。最堪注目者，爲事變前深受德人軍事顧問重陶之重慶軍第十二軍「薛岳部」，亦迅速輔向親美。伏牛山脈魯山等之兵工廠，美英製之步槍，輕機槍，裝甲車，堆積如山。漢口作戰之後，於民國廿九年之襄東戰線，一度出現之蘇聯式捷克式軍機，現已絕跡。將校指揮之軍隊，現亦全染美國色彩，即此次作戰美國指揮重慶之野心，不但在軍事一方，即政治經濟，亦莫不完全席捲屬於美國治下，重慶獨立自主無形之中重慶民眾已入美。國圈套。</p>

<h3>擊沉敵艦艇十七艘　吉川少將榮授殊員</h3>
<p>當昭和十七年（一九四二年）二月，攻略巴里島一役中，遭遇敵有力艦隊，而以寡敵衆之日海軍第八驅逐隊；及同年十一月底，在瓜達爾加納爾一役中於倫加洋面擊破優勢敵艦隊而充分發揮日海軍水雷戰隊傳　的攻擊精神之增援部隊，前曾由聯合艦隊司令長官授與感狀。這二戰役中，驅逐艦長吉川　海軍中佐出力最多。去年十一月廿四日，吉川中佐在布加西方海面與敵合艦隊司令長官為表彰　列起見，奏聞日　，奉旨特予晉級為海軍少將，於五月一日由海軍省公佈。此實為驅逐艦隊長最　之殊榮。據其兵校時代之間期生中野實海軍大佐　　少將戰績如次：</p>
<p>少將爲水雷戰隊驅逐艦艦長，以作戰勇猛馳　軍中，參加大小戰役共計三十五此，每次均獲大戰果。擊沈敵艦計巡洋艦六艘，驅逐艦十艘，潛水艇一艘，共計十七艘，並常在歷次戰役中開啟勝利之門，單獨直接擊退之敵機達六百四十一架，其豐功　續，實爲全艦隊敬仰之中心。去年十一月二十四日，完全運輸陸軍部隊布加島後，歸途中，在該島西方五七每里的每上遭遇敵巡軍艦戰隊，驅逐維隊計八艘，立即肉薄攻擊，在槍林彈雨中突入敵陣，　致壯烈殉國，據友艦七官歸來報告，該艦遭遇敵部隊與之交戰後，發生大炸裂，少將以下全體艦員。殆已與該體同其命逕矣</p>
<p>生平經歷數十戰役</p>
<p>少將平時素以「獻身君國」一語自許，此實爲少將整個生涯之一貫信條。這忠誠在歷次戰役的赫赫戰　中，證明無遺。其中最激烈之戰役，即爲巴里島海戰，第三次所羅門海戰及特洛基</p>
<p>在巴里島海戰中，少將爲水雷戰隊之隔逐艦長，掩護陸軍登陸巴厘島，正在該島東方倫波水道哨戒時，遭遇巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦三艘所組成之美荷聯合艦隊，當即擊沈驅逐艦二艘，另一艘重傷，其餘倉皇遁走。巡洋艦本有攻擊驅逐艦的任務，然少將竟以軍艦肉搏驅逐艦三，巡洋艦二所組成的敵艦隊，且擊沉其二，重傷其一，其偉功實充分證明了少將的信念與勇猛。</p>
<p>在第三次所羅門海戰中，自八月下旬至十一月中旬，在敵制空權下，少將擔任使命重大的運輸任務，而得以登陸成功，此期間會與友艦協力擊沉敵巡洋艦驅逐艦各一艘，至第三次所羅門海戰發生，少將為我艦隊最前經濟隊的驅逐艦長，發見敵艦後，一面向全軍發出營報，一面即出敵不意，突入敵艦隊，擊沉敵大型巡洋艦二艘，更重傷大型巡洋艦，驅逐艦各一艘，　少將抱不入虎穴，焉得虎子之決心，使敵艦隊限於混亂，而爲本海戰開勝利之端</p>
<p>完成任務壯烈殉國</p>
<p>去年十一月，敵　中南太平洋力面的全力攻波根維爾島。日海軍在五次波根　爾島空戰中對敵艦給與極大損害，然敵仍不顧一切，在該島登陸，日軍奮勇抵抗，少將在此次戰役中担任極困難的運輸任務，第一次二次均究成作戰目的，但在歸途之壮烈殉國。</p>
<p>少將爲舊塾州　吉川　族的後裔，自幼即受良好的家庭敎育，質實剛健，有古武士風。資質聰穎，忠孝兼全，氣度星朗　達，爲衆所愛戴，遇難輒挺身而出。自入海軍　以來、二十餘年，始終服務於永宣戰隊，驅逐艦，企求打破華盛頓會議的五。實爲神的存在。（翔。譯自五月二日東京每臼斯聞）</p>

<h3>日第卅九屆海軍節　本市盛大慶祝　前後五日分別舉行盛大節目</h3>
<p>本月二十七日爲日本第三十九屈海軍節，當茲決戰階段，日益迫近之際，回顧以往勝利歷史，意義益　深長，本市中日谷團體，爲慶祝此歷史上紀念節目起見，決於紀念日，先後五日分別舉行各種盛大節目，其實施細目，業於十七日詳細決定。此次紀念節目，以强力簡約爲主。電影方面，除「夏威夷馬來海戰」及「帝國海軍勝利之記錄」二片外，並有日本映書社特派員前在印度洋從軍時，乘坐帝國潛水艇所攝得之擊沉敵　送船實况影片，亦將同時公開放映，片名爲「擊沉」。此外並有海軍美術普及會，在大陸新報社內大陸書廊舉行「大柬亞戰爭海軍美術展覽會」，申報館及大陸新報館聯合假座華懋飯店內舉行「中國古寮展覽會」，茲將詳細節目，　要分誌於後：</p>
<p>盛大慶祝節目</p>
<p>文化電影館，於二十四日起至三十一日止之一星期內，舉行講與電影大會，放映「帝國海軍勝利之記錄」鉅片，共九卷。二十四日下午八時至十時，市敎育局中華電影以司中聯合假座大華大戲院，舉行紀念演講電影大會，放映「夏威夷馬來海戰」鉅片，招待中國敎職員。二士八日下午一時三十分至五時，中國放送協會假座美琪大戲院舉行音樂與電影大會，下午七時起上海新聞聯合會中華電影公司等五團體假座大光明聯合舉行慶祝友邦海軍紀念日演謂軍樂電影大會，由松島艦隊報道部長王講，海軍軍樂隊演奏。二十七日下午三時至七時新聞聯合會假座跑馬廳，西僑靑年會，逸園，分別舉行紀念運動大會。七時至八時二十分興亞報國會　座臼本俱樂部舉行紀念會。七時三十分至十時日本映畫社等假座東和劇場舉行海軍紀念日電影大會，放映「轟沉」及「拉巴爾前綫等」影片，人場券每位三十元，全部移充軍用機製作資金。六時至十時海軍協會上海支部等假座國際劇塲舉行第三十九屆海軍紀念之夕，電影音樂演講大會，由松島報道部畏演講，陸海軍樂隊演奏。二十八日上午九時至十一時，日本國民學校兒童淸掃海軍墓地及八　　，八時起，日本中等學生赴江灣行軍並參觀。十時至十二時興亞報國會假座上海劇塲，舉行陸海軍傷病　安會。此外尙有中華電影公司巡廻班於二十六·七·八三日內，分赴市內各地巡廻放映宣傳。</p>
<h3>燈火管制辦法改善　力避燈光外洩　防護團實施防空訓練</h3>
<p>本市永久燈火管制，自三月三日實施以來，成續尙佳，陸海軍防空司令部，為使市民平時業務得以　　辦理，幷以時值夏令。窗戶應掛防空暗幕，殊惑悶熱，故對燈火管制辦法重行修正，已於昨（十七）日正式發表，惟民衆仍須隨時注意，防止燈火外洩。又市民防空本部爲使各大廈工廠特設防護團强化完善，以便應付萬一，故對各特設防護團員之加緊防空訓練，殊加關注，自本月九日以來，令各大廈工廠分別自動，隨時實施防空措置之各項演習，幷派員指導，以資熟練，幷求取得聯絡相輔而行，務使全市防空組織，臻於完善。</p>
<p>防空歌已製曲灌片</p>
<p>上海特別市市民防空本部，爲喚醒全市市民之防空意識，並以促進五百萬市民積極自衛上海之決心起見，前曾商請木報社之贊助，向全市市民徵求防空歌曲，茲以徵求已經相當時日，計慼徵之歌詞，共一百十一篇，其中佳作頗多，經請梁秀予，陳彬龢，及孫理甫三先生任審查委員，評定甲乙，優採用，結果僉以金玉谷之作品爲最佳，（歌詞及名次已於本報發表）遂選定爲防空歌，並請我國署各製曲家梁樂音作曲。茲以梁氏之努力，自出心裁，譜就妙曲，相得益彰，防空本部不久當舉行普樂會，演奏所選定之歌曲，除托由中華電影公司於刻在攝製之防空電影中，揮入此項防空歌曲外，並擬灌製唱片，利用無綫電播音，以廣宣傳，俾所選佳作普及全市，以喚醒不啻身處決戰下常住戰塲上海市民對於防空之自覺，並以鞏固其在大東亞戰爭中爭取最後勝利之決心，深盼各界市民予以協助。</p>
<h3>黃埔灘路一段　禁止通行</h3>
<p>第一區公署布吿云：查黃浦灘路三號水交社及南黃浦灘路九號法國火輪船公司大樓間之一段，與大上海路九號中國建業地產公司大樓以東之一段，外，所有行人車輛，一概禁止通行。</p>
<h3>補助教職員　捐款報告</h3>
<p>許　初·吳繼雲二先升各捐贈一萬二千元。劉靖基·徐補孫·王伯元三先生各捐附六千元。黃雨齋·王海波·竹森生·唐志良。劉念義·丁厚卿·王學農·潘志傑·林朝聘諸光生各捐贈二千元。吳柜如先生捐贈一千元。</p>
<p>以上共收六萬一千元，連前共收八十二萬八千元。</p>
<h3>中央諮詢機關之必要　—關於市政諮詢委員會之輿論—</h3>
<p>上海市政諮詢委員會決定設置生活必需品，治安。財政。敎育。鄉區等五小組委員會，協力推進上海市政，已見前報。其性質與機能之明確化，在其成立之初，即爲一般市民所切盼。會內外人士頗主張「對上海市政用諮詢形式之民意活動，終不能打開上海常前之嚴震局面，慼重新成立適應上海現實，且能結集一般園民總力之民意機關。」故諮詢委員會今後之活動方向，頗堪注目。對此種改革論，亦有人主張應設置與上海市政諮詢機關不同之對中央政府民意機關。茲綜合各方面對諮詢委員會之批判，歸納其大要如次</p>
<p>一·對上海一般政治經濟，處於地方政府之上海市政府，以前占何種地位，今後又將占何種地位，實爲此時最應嚴格檢討之問題。因上海在政洽·經濟·文化上所處地位之重要，故上海政治與其被上海市政府所左右，不如由强力的中央政府來決定</p>
<p>例如對物賢統制有政院直屬之商統會，對米糧統制有行政院直屬之米統會，對金融界有財政部及中央備備銀行，對企業界有實業部，各負其政治上責任。中央政治對上海直接影響極大。</p>
<p>故眞欲重建上海，與其設置對市政府之諮詢機關，不如先設置對中央政府之諮爲機關。不然，該機關之一性質，頗有不澈底之處。</p>
<p>二，諮詢委員會十二日招待中日記者團，舉行座談會，常委陳彬辭即席代表常務委員會聲稱：「五小組委員會中，生活必需品委員會之活動，最爲緊要。」復興上海經濟上須速即改革表有五點：</p>
<p>甲·採用適合中國國情民情的統制方法，</p>
<p>乙·統制的簡單化</p>
<p>丙·消滅貪污及暴利主義，</p>
<p>丁·中日當局全面協力，</p>
<p>戊·市民之積極的協力當局，</p>
<p>此五點殆全部爲上海市政府所不能解決而爲中央性之問題。</p>
<p>聞諮詢委員會正在努力解決米糧及燃料問題，在米糧問題上，上海市政府所担任者，僅米統會交付之食米配給事宜。</p>
<p>然上海食米問題，如不先解决，全國各地之收買問題絕對不能解决。米統會爲行政院直　機關，米糧問題爲全國問題，故對此問題之豁詢，當然應直接對中央而　。統制慼簡單化，諮詢亦應簡單化，中間經市政府間接交涉，徒使本熊複雜。燃料間題尤然。煤斤問題之决定，全在中央之政治方針，市政府僅得向中央條陳希望。</p>
<p>三·二十五名諮詢委員，大都參加三四個小組委員會季員。此殊有碍其集中責任與努力於一問題。又如敎育委員會如趙正平，沈嗣良等現任大學校長參加，但如朱博泉，林康候，陳日平諮氏，或在過去爲敎師之財界人士，成爲現任學校贅事之財界人土，亦參加爲該會委員。然如敎育委員會者，現任敎育家應占絕對多數，故本市之大·中·小。學敎師之眞正代表者，慼參加爲委員。專以名人爲委員，殊使一部份知識階級對諮詢委員會加以「釣名沽譽」之惡評。諮詢委員會常其發　之初，亟應徹底加以自我批判。（翔：譯自五月十六日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>杭嘉蘇錫各地　新繭月內開評　評價每担最高六千元</h3>
<p>本年江浙兩省產區，春繭即將登塲，實業部業於日前舉行本年繭價評議會，决定收瞞價格，在三百八十斤繅折之乾議爲六千元，其他依此標準價格比較决定之。茲悉各絲廠已派員分往各地產區收繭，聞杭州地區新兩，定本月十九日登塲開科，嘉興地區二十三匹臼開科，蘇州二十六七日開秤，無錫下月初亦可開秤，</p>
<p>（又訊）本市十五家銀行組織之收繭貸款銀團，貸放收繭借款，曾與本市各絲廠成立五萬萬元貸款合同，並已開始動用。茲各絲廠此項貸款收繭資金尙不敷用，故於前（十五）日復又成立二萬萬元收繭貸款，其利息與貸放方式，仍與前相同。</p>
<h3>河南作戰進神速　渝受嚴重打擊　日陸軍報導部發言人談</h3>
<p>日駐華上海陸軍部報道部，於昨（十七）日下午二時，　南京路外攤華　飯店入樓，循例舉行報道常會，報道部當局計到坂本中尉，赤星囑托，即席由報道部發言入，就此次河南作戰之成功，及在印度伊姆法爾之作戰，發表　詳。茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>洛陽陷落己在眉睫</p>
<p>此次河南作戰之成功，日軍進展神速，超逾預定時期，不但使渝方　惶失措，尤使敵英美胆塞，當華北日軍渡黃河開始進擊後，爲時僅約三週，而華中日軍亦在信陽開始行動會同攻擊，僅及九日，華中華北之日軍，已在確山會師，乃將平漢綫打通，故此次之進展，神速驚人，殊出渝方發言人意料之外。旋發言人又調：此次作戰在軍事上而論，打通平漢綫，即河南作戰之第一階段完成，而在河防陣地前綫敗退之渝軍，在獲得在密縣禹縣方面之湯恩伯軍增援，猶企　掙扎發動反擊，但此次反攻，乃僅爲一種單　而已，益使日軍之殲滅作戰有利，我人觀日本大本營所發表之　入戰果，即可明瞭。繼又述及在第二戰綫之渝軍伏牛山麓主要陳地，左翼方面巳為日接卸化部隊加以重重包圍，並正向各處予以殲滅中，而另一方面在洛陽附近之渝蔣　文軍，亦遭進攻汜水及密縣之日軍包圍殲滅，故洛陽陷落已迫在眉睫。</p>
<p>渝方　受嚴重威脅</p>
<p>按洛揚為渝方之牙城，亦即「抗戰」渝方作軍事上政治上之重要據點，今以河南作戰之第一目標，在殲減渝方第一綫之整個戰力，至於平漢綫之打通，僅爲今次作戰之副產品。又第一戰區司令官蔣鼎文此次遭受慘欺，猶企圖收拾殘部，以求挽回頹勢，而湯思伯所部之主力，約有惡十師，刻已陷混亂狀熊中，即當蔣鼎文接獲蔣介石之堅守洛陽之嚴令時，洛陽亦陷無法堅守之境。迫不得已，乃決心拋棄堅守洛陽之策，蔣本人先告　鼠，期在第三戰綫作努力之準備，由此可見渝軍在此次作戰上，其素質低落，士氣喪失，巳更爲明顯。故日軍不但在軍事上獲得勝利，即在其他義意上亦頗重大，日鹵獲戰利品及俘處頗多，尤以來歸者紛紛。按此次河南作戰之渝軍，多爲湯恩伯之最精銳部隊，渠本人亦承認之，但此次之一敗途地，殊爲渝方之嚴重威脅。又查其他戰區，渝方形勢均各據一方，指揮毫不統一，以把守　踞爲主，如友軍發生危險時，絕不予以救助。最後發言人又謂：現正包圍共軍之胡宗南軍，在渝方有人主張放棄該包圍作戰，俾便速即援救河南危急。目前渝軍將領之低能，當有引起英美今後在援助上與利用渝政權上，勢將有重加研討之可能。另一方面，又引起內部之和平家及「抗戰」派之紛爭不止，從此亦使和平有利。今番平漢綫之打通，在華北。華中之物賢，更賴通暢外，且政治穩定，治安日臻確保，是乃不可否認之事實。</p>
<p>伊姆法爾在包國中</p>
<p>該發言人旋又發表伊如　爾之作戰狀况謂，目前日軍已將該處之敵英印軍第四軍隊加以包圍，現正予以猛力攻擊，使之澈底潰減，且日軍此次進攻，使敵陸路補給路綫，究全截　，己從平面戰爭，而易爲立體戰爭。敵方雖竭力擬由空中設補給，惟現彼日軍包圍之敵軍力，達有六萬人左右，即使敵從空軍予以補給，亦無濟於事。當初敵方之唯一信賴機械化部隊，如今汽油用　，不能行動，每日拋棄戰車於路途，比此皆是，自四月五日至五月五日，此一月中，敵互型輸送機被日軍擊落者統計有九十八架之多。</p>
<p>偷渡怒江已遭擊潰</p>
<p>其次雲南本月十二日偷渡怒江，逕日軍加以擊潰，粉碎彼　之企圖。查上月二十七日，滇渝遠征軍亦曾有偷渡之舉，但旋即被日軍擊滅，今次又圖死灰復燃，當經日軍加以掃蕩，現正進擊竄逃殘軍。關於雲南遠征軍，此次之企圖，實由於上次在緬北部之史蒂戚爾部下之美渝軍作戰，以及在印之英印軍苦戰，未予協力，毫無表示，備受內外抨擊，今次以偷渡怒江之舉，作為數衍聯合軍之共同作戰最後發　，人又謂，此次日軍佔領鄭州及其他各地，居民均安居樂業，並對和平　抑益深，並出而維持地方治安，努力建設，刻正迅速進步。末又發　在此作戰前後之日軍特　性謂：電紀嚴明，　民和　親善，故人民莫不安　，絕不　擾。</p>
<h3>讀者助學消息</h3>
<p>職業指導演講助學金辦事處及社會服務處主辦之職業指導演講會，已於十四日上午八時起舉行。各校本屆畢業學生到者五百餘人，內大學佔十之三，高中佔十之七，助學金受助學生佔十之五。講師到裴製卿·潘仰堯·黃希閣·許長卿·陸梅僧·陳靑士等六位。先由本處主任沈有乾博士致開會詞，並逐一介紹，各講師循循善誘，理論與實騐並重，莫不側耳傾聽，掌聲不絕。</p>
<p>催寄學校概况　本處會於四月中旬以「各級學校概况調查表」一份發致本市各大中小學，請即塡就寄還備考，一月以來，塡報者已達十之七八，惟尙有少數學校，迄未塡來。按此項表格，關係重要，因本處於下屆辦理助金工作時，將以此表格爲準繩。故望未塡各校，勿再延誤。又本市小學林立，上次遺　未發者爲數頗多，未接到者面索或附自備貼足郵票寫明校址之信封，自當立即照寄。</p>
<p>否齋主人續捐三校助金　本市私立阜春，西成，務本等三小學，承苦齋主人慨捐淸寒助學金，已有三期，本學期該校等又獲捐助各惡萬元正，已於日前如數領到，苦齋主人熱心敎育，樂育英材，其嘉惠淸寒之助，洵無母也。</p>

<p>共收二萬二千四百八十元，結存一百九十四萬九千五百二十八元。</p>
<h3>新汽車許可證　公用局葉局長談</h3>
<p>市公用局長業雪松氏，昨對記者就本市汽車限制問題，發表談話如下：「自大東亞戰爭爆發以後，本局爲節省物資起見，曾訂定限制使用汽車辦法，對無使用必要者，加以嚴格取締，施行以來，頗著成效，但近來一般不明限制辦法者，竟紛起由請，以致此項案件，紛至此來，多生枝節，須知在查戰爭决勝階段，日益迫近聲中，物資之節約，較前更爲殷切，故今後對於新申請汽車許可證者，將一律暫行停止發給」。</p>
<h3>第二警局澈查　兩賭場複業</h3>
<p>南市六大賭　，奉令停業後，　傳有復活企圖，但迄未見諸實施，惟邇來又復盛傳華民與綠實雨賭窟，暗中又復秘密復業，每於午夜十時起，至翌日淸晨，容納賭各入局，從事賭博，市第二警察局據報後，以既經明令禁絕，何得再行復業，殊屬違反政令，當即嚴令該當分局，切實徹底查明具報。</p>

<h3>強化同業公會組織</h3>
<p>— 水兆熊</p>
<p>各業同業公會自改組成立以來，於今忽忽一年。其成績之優劣，其進步之　速，可得而言者滋多。</p>
<p>同業公會本身沒有獨立工作，一切繁務都是為的承上轉下的忙著，所以有人讓笑公會是一個資本小範圍大的信托所亦不為過。雖然承上轉下有其必要；但是如何充實自己，如何維繫獨立，實爲當務之急；這是踏過暫時性到永久性應取的步驟，　例說，辦一個同業子弟學校，辦一個同業技術學校；爲同業設立一個義務該療所、補充同業德智修養而有一個定期出版物及學　演講；為提高同業高尚趣味以及增進體育而隨時舉行各種軍團娛樂及各種運動旅行。　設同業合作社或合作銀行以謀同業員工之福利等。</p>
<p>目前同業公會連及其會員處在朮重督導之下，就說要做到承上轉下的公事，已　四不討好之苦機　而論：屬於市政府者有經濟局；屬於第一區公署者有經濟處；屬於第一警察局者有經濟科，最近更　產生一個經濟保安處。以同樣性質的商業　治組織論，則有商統會及其附屬各會聯合會，此外尚等。在本埠之外，則有實業部建設部全國經濟委員會以及財政部稅務機關均可直　問接訓令指示。說得親愛精誠些，同業公會有這許多照　的上司，幸何如之。可是機構　　，政出多門，卻也有　付不了之苦。因此我認為今後工商管理機構必須早當局調整統一，減少重床　架的粉雜，使　為有系統單純化之組織，則同業公會之效率可獲增進，而縣商亦獲托福矣。</p>
<p>目今各同業公會理　事人選固多有資格有學　的人物，但是濫竽充數，僅以資財偽帽子者亦所屬多有：其次公會職員固不少有學騐有濟幹的人才，但是不乏空虛落伍之　。我認為欲強化經濟統制，必須加強同業公會人員。一方而對於理　事人選應嚴定被選人最低限度的條伯，次之應加重每個理監事的責任，使被當選者並非優逸的名譽職，必須做出實際的成績。至於公會職員的任用最好能寓考選於　用之中，比較可得眞人才。</p>

<p>實際上，　夫的憂　舉動，早已為人所注意，所以大家對於他的請假，是沒有人大驚小怪的。</p>
<p>「鄉出來齣年靑人，總有一次會這樣的。這是更京的水土病。邢末，你就慢慢休養一下吧！」</p>
<p>部長說完這樣話，曾給了少許路費，其中一位同事說：</p>
<p>「你到什麼地方靜養去呀？」</p>
<p>「還沒有一定。」</p>
<p>「眞寫意！那末我吿訴你一個好地方吧　近處旣不花錢，而又適於靜養的地方，就是海岸」</p>
<p>這樣說完，就把途中應坐的車，以及旅館的介紹信，都寫出來交給了　夫。</p>
<p>隆夫是不管海，也不管山，只要靜和賤，任何地方都可以。所以並未深加思索，而就決定到名呌久里濱的海岸去了。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，他坐火軍由高圓寺到品川，然後就坐上湘南電車而到浦賀去了。秋天將落的太陽，從寬大的玻璃窗窗戶裘放射進淡淡的光綫來。順便偷看一下傍邊人所讀的報紙，上面用特號字登載着初度空襲雲南的大課題。</p>
<p>（總還是請假休息的好……，）隆夫在車廂裏坐著，這樣想。電車開足了馬力一直向前奔馳，於是自己覺睡眼朦號起來。這次旅行並沒有旅行的味道，然一而比陪着市來　家到　州去作寫生旅各去的時候，更多一些惑</p>
<p>這個時候的外面景緻，是陸陸　的人家二望無　邊。過了橫濱後，就是一望無際的平原。在遠處，碧藍的海，在閃閃作光。</p>
<p>（那就是東京　，哼，這完全像河一樣的東</p>
<p>他一向總是輕視不像海的東京灣。於是回想起家鄉那樣　闊的海和高大的山，　覺得有無限的　　。因此，絲絲不斷的想家悒鬱，　地出現於心頭。</p>
<p>（常十分無辦法時，曾經約定給枝妹寫信的。現在應富是寫信的時候了。）</p>
<p>身疲力竭，覺得一切都無味。於是想到，只有砲回鹿兒鳥去，向父母吿饒，向親友陪罪，除此之外，別無他法。</p>
<p>不知不覺，窗外的縈　變了。矮矮的山，逐淅逼近眼前。　道非常的多。突然問，出乎意外的風景，映現於他的眼　。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n135</h1>
<h3>Announcement to Female Compatriots</h3>
<p>The great Confucian scholar Gu Yanwu of our country said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." This is indeed a profound truth. It is worth our heartfelt adherence to. It should not be interpreted as referring only to men, but should be interpreted as "individuals," including women.</p>
<p>Women's thoughts and actions are enough to influence the family, and thus enough to influence their husbands and children. Therefore, we have the example of Madam Jing Jiang assisting her husband in building the nation, and Mencius's mother teaching her son to achieve fame. In addition, there are countless precedents for learning, such as Madam Curie dedicating herself to science. To shirk this responsibility would be a mistake. Modern warfare is total war, and cannot be borne by only half the population, the men. Let us briefly review the expectations and responsibilities placed on women in various warring nations, as a lesson for us.</p>
<p>Japan's age limits for conscription and labor are stricter than those of other countries. Recently, in order to implement the "Essential Outline for Decisive Battle Emergency Measures," there has been significant activity on the domestic front. Consequently, on March 28, the cabinet decided to strengthen the system of women's volunteer corps. The purpose is to organize unmarried women aged twelve to forty into women's volunteer corps, based on their occupation and region, to engage in tasks suitable for women's characteristics in the coming year, and to actively advance towards increasing production for war efforts. This measure is different from general conscription, but it aims to expand the organization of women's labor, so that women can spontaneously assist in increasing production based on patriotism in response to the needs of the current situation. Today's Japanese newspaper reports from Tokyo's Central News Agency that factories across Japan are working day and night to increase aircraft production, and the deployment of women's volunteer corps is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Germany announced the "Military Service Law" on March 16, 1935, which allowed the conscription of men aged eighteen to forty-five. On September 22, 1939, the "Student Apprentice Placement Order" was announced, stipulating the mobilization measures for male and female students aged sixteen and above during the busy farming season. On January 27 of this year, the "Wartime Labor Application Order" was announced, requiring men aged sixteen to sixty-five and women aged seventeen to forty-five to apply to their respective labor bureaus.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union announced the "Military Service Law" on September 1, 1939, stipulating that men aged eighteen to fifty should be conscripted for active duty. In addition, it stipulated that women aged nineteen to fifty with special skills should register with the army and navy and be incorporated into the second reserve. According to the "Labor Law," the age limit for conscription is sixteen to fifty-nine for men and sixteen to fifty-four for women. In terms of auxiliary labor, even young men and women as young as twelve are conscripted.</p>
<p>The enemy Britain announced the "National Service Act" on September 3, 1939, which required men aged eighteen to forty-one to be conscripted. On September 5 of the same year, the "National Registration Act" was announced, which required laborers aged twenty-one to sixty-five to register. In November 1941, the scope of registration was changed to men aged eighteen to fifty-one and women aged eighteen to forty, and women aged twenty-one to thirty-one were forcibly conscripted.</p>
<p>The enemy America implemented the "Selective Service Act" from September 16, 1940, which stipulated that men aged twenty-one to thirty-six should be registered for military training. The following year, the age limit was expanded to eighteen to sixty-five. Recently, according to Paul McNutt, head of the Wartime Manpower Commission, based on the Austin-Wadsworth Act, women aged eighteen to fifty must also be forcibly registered and have an obligation to be conscripted by the state.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that the demands on women in wartime in various countries are no less than those on men, only differing in age limits and the nature of work due to physical strength. Fortunately, the women of our country, in view of the international situation and the domestic environment, should repeatedly and deeply study the true meaning of gender equality and understand how to conduct themselves. Otherwise, if they confine themselves to being concubines and slaves, allowing themselves to be played with and still be complacent, their ignorance is pitiful. As for contributing to the darkness and degradation of society, whether intentional or unintentional, their crime is punishable. Considering the position and work undertaken by women in other countries, what should those women who do nothing but play mahjong, dance, and watch plays all day with red nails and permed hair think?</p>
<p>I hope that my female compatriots will, from today onwards, resolve to uplift themselves, correct their faults if they have them, and strive harder if they do not. And remember the saying, "Every 'woman' is responsible for the rise and fall of the world."</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Enemy Positions in Western Kohima, Enemy Troops Defending Imphal Are Exhausted</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 17th – On the 14th, despite adverse weather conditions, Japanese army fighter planes repelled enemy fighter groups and resolutely launched a fierce attack on enemy artillery positions near Zipsa, west of Kohima. They broke through the enemy's anti-aircraft barrage and carried out intense dive bombing, with bombs hitting enemy artillery positions and groups of vehicles concentrated nearby, inflicting devastating blows. In the aerial combat, they also shot down two high-speed bombers. One Japanese plane did not return to base. Also on this day, a group of fighter planes attacked a certain area in central Burma, but was met by the Japanese army, which shot down eight P-51 aircraft (three of which were unconfirmed). One Japanese plane did not return to base.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th – According to a report from Kandy, the Southeast Asia Command announced on the 16th that Japanese aircraft bombed American and Chongqing troops stationed in the Mogaung Valley of northern Burma, inflicting significant damage.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 17th – The enemy troops defending Imphal for more than a month have shown signs of exhaustion and wavering in recent days. According to the enemy's intention, they originally intended to confront the Japanese army at Imphal until the rainy season arrived, believing that the Japanese offensive would be limited by the rainy season. Therefore, the enemy army used its superior air force to carry out aerial supply work to enhance its combat power and implement counterattacks. To date, the biggest factor in the enemy's ability to sustain resistance is reliance on continuous aerial transport of personnel and materials. This method is tantamount to giving the enemy's soldiers spiritual vitality. Aerial supply is subject to various conditions, and its effectiveness is far less than that of land transport supply. Therefore, in the Indo-Burmese border area, the aerial supply work will be greatly affected after the rainy season arrives. Currently, the enemy's aerial supply work is carried out at night or at dawn because they fear attacks from Japanese aircraft during the day. However, night and dawn are the times when the rain is most intense. Therefore, after the rainy season arrives, the aerial supply work will encounter the greatest difficulties. The Japanese army, on the other hand, is different because it has already secured ground supply routes, so it can still carry out the annihilation battle against the British Indian Fourth Army even in the rainy season. Now, the enemy relies on the solid fortifications built over a year and a half, about a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, hundreds of artillery pieces, and aerial supply to continue to resist. However, the arrival of the rainy season will make the enemy feel the crisis of severed supply lines. At the same time, coupled with the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, the enemy will inevitably fall into a difficult situation, and their confidence in defending Imphal will waver.</p>
<h3>Factories Nationwide Work Day and Night, Japanese Aircraft Production Doubles, Women's Volunteer Corps Mobilized for Diligent Work</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – During this decisive battle period, what the billion people of Asia are most concerned about is enhancing the superior air power that can overwhelm and annihilate the enemy. The aircraft production target for the 19th year of Showa (1944) must achieve a several-fold increase over the production of the 18th year. Factories across the country are working day and night to launch a production increase campaign, resulting in a constant increase in aircraft production. Japanese aircraft production has been focusing on ultra-priority production for more than a year, and aircraft production has been increasing dramatically month by month. In this year, there have been many cases of several-fold increases in production. At the same time, new and advanced aircraft with excellent performance have been manufactured one after another. Looking at the production index of a certain factory, the production of one worker has increased several times in this year. On the one hand, the number of workers has also increased. The total production value of the factory has increased several times. This is not only an example of the rapid increase in aircraft industrial production in Japan. The details of this figure are explained as follows: What is most striking is that the amount of production per person has increased several times. This amount of production is the amount of money that is evenly distributed among the number of workers, and it is not caused by raising the official price during this year. There are even cases of the official price falling, and there are three reasons for this. First, production equipment has been formally prepared. Second, with the improvement of the same production equipment, there have been significant improvements in operation management, and the production time required for a large number of reduced man-hours has been implemented. In addition, the military authorities have worked hard to unify machine types or strive to simplify them, and have also made reasonable adjustments to the inspection standards of products. Third, the increase in the labor capacity of workers is most noteworthy. Whether they are staff or workers, they are fighting under the banner of "Kamikaze Squad Members," striving to achieve the production target. What is particularly noteworthy is that while the amount of production per worker has increased, the number of workers has also increased several times. However, the workers who have been added in one year at a surprising rate of 80% to 100% are almost all unskilled workers, not even experienced workers. They are all novices to the aircraft industry, newly recruited soldiers or female workers and female volunteer corps. Moreover, the average age of the newly recruited soldiers has also increased significantly in this year. This fact can generally imply the following two points: that Japan's aircraft industry has indeed made great progress today, and has leaped from infancy to adolescence. The second thing to pay attention to is how much room there is for future increases in the amount of production per worker. What is most noticeable in aircraft factories is the dispatch of women's volunteer corps. In terms of actual working conditions, women account for a certain percentage of workers in the airframe manufacturing department, and women are also replacing men in the engine manufacturing department. Although the dispatch of women's volunteer corps is only a modest manifestation in terms of numbers, their strong will to work and their fighting spirit, which is not inferior to that of men, is commendable.</p>
<h3>Japanese Postal Savings Exceed 20 Billion Yen</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – According to a survey by the Ministry of Communications on the 17th, postal savings have now exceeded 20 billion yen, which is the largest record since the start of the postal savings business in Meiji 8 (1875). According to the previous year, May, it was 10 billion yen, and it has doubled in just two years. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the increase record was 3.5 billion yen in June of Showa 12 (1937), 5 billion yen in July of Showa 14, 10 billion yen in May of Showa 17, and 15.8 billion yen in July of Showa 18. That is, since the Sino-Japanese War, it has achieved more than five times the good results.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Raid Two Islands, Fifteen Crashed, Japanese Aircraft Destroy Enemy Military Facilities</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – Twelve enemy aircraft, including P40 and B25 types, raided Biak Island, west of New Guinea Island, on the morning of the 15th. The Japanese garrison shot down seven P40 aircraft. Two Japanese aircraft did not return.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – Twenty-one enemy B24 aircraft attacked Merauke Island on the morning of the 15th. Four were destroyed by the Japanese army before retreating. Japanese losses were very slight.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – A certain Japanese base unit in the southwest Pacific launched a strong attack on Hollandia on the north coast of New Guinea Island, destroying several enemy military facilities. All aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Tani Visits Minister Aoki</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – Japanese Ambassador to China Tani arrived here on the 15th. On the morning of the 16th, at 9:30, he went to the Greater East Asia Ministry and met with Minister Aoki. In the afternoon at 2:00, he met with Greater East Asia Minister Aoki again and had various cordial discussions, leaving after two hours.</p>
<h3>Philippine President Announces Five Major Policies</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Manila, 17th – The Manila District Governors and Village Chiefs Conference was held on the 17th. Philippine President Laurel attended and announced five major government policies, urging citizens to cooperate. The policies are as follows: To enable Filipinos to live in peace, it is necessary to restore peace and order throughout the country. To maintain the people's livelihood, it is necessary to maintain an adequate supply of food. To eliminate unscrupulous elements and corrupt officials, it is necessary to rectify the government and government-affiliated agencies. To utilize resources, food, medicinal herbs, etc., and to make education Filipino, it should be implemented by law.</p>
<h3>Vargas Reports on His Duties</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Manila, 17th – Philippine Ambassador to Japan Vargas and Finance Minister Alunan returned to the country on the 15th. On the 16th, they paid their respects to President Laurel and reported on their duties.</p>
<h3>Total Uprising Movement Promoted in Various Parts of Japan</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – The Central Headquarters of the Japanese National Total Uprising Movement was solemnly held here on the 14th. First, Prime Minister Tojo gave an opening speech, followed by various leaders shouting slogans for the total uprising, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic, and the movement was strongly promoted. Local general meetings were also held in various places, and lively agricultural development movements were launched across the country. The basic program of this movement aims to gather the total strength of 100 million Japanese people and focus on the goal of winning victory. The movement's objectives are to enhance the national will to fight, increase production, ensure food supply, and defend the country's four current major tasks. Local movements are also carried out in accordance with this policy. The method of implementation is decided by the local liaison conferences composed of prefectural and prefectural support associations and prefectural government liaison consultation councils, taking into account the actual situation of each locality.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Troops Show American Characteristics, Willing to Degrade Autonomous Status</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th – Chongqing's belief in resisting Japan has been increasingly strengthened since the Cairo Conference last year, along with the fierce progress of the Pacific war. Therefore, it has been seeking for a long time to strengthen the military strength of the first line of the mainland counteroffensive and the air transport base against Japan in the southeast. However, the anti-Japanese counteroffensive base was crushed in this instant collapse. It is noteworthy that the Chongqing army has American characteristics. The training and equipment of the Chongqing army, which is the mainstay of the anti-Japanese counteroffensive, is completely Americanized. Infantry schools and artillery schools have hired American advisers to train various cadres. What is most noteworthy is that the Chongqing Army's 12th Army "Xue Yue Department," which was deeply influenced by German military advisers before the incident, is also rapidly turning pro-American. In the ordnance factories in Lushan and other places in the Funiu Mountains, American and British-made rifles, light machine guns, and armored vehicles are piled up like mountains. After the Battle of Hankou, the Soviet-style Czech-style military aircraft that once appeared on the Xiangdong Front in 1940 have now disappeared. The army commanded by generals and colonels is now completely Americanized. The United States' ambition to command Chongqing in this operation is not only in the military field, but also in the political and economic fields, which are completely swept into American rule. Chongqing's independence and autonomy have invisibly entered the American trap.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Police Team to Hold Sumo Tournament</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th – The Japanese Naval Police Team in Nanjing will hold a sumo tournament on the 27th of this month to commemorate the 39th Navy Day. It will also demonstrate flag signals and combat training.</p>
<h3>Indian Heavy Industry Plants Equipped with Self-Destruct Devices, Indians Dissatisfied with British</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 17th – Recently, an Indian arrived here. According to him, Indian local capitalists are extremely dissatisfied with the attitude of the British. They hope that the British will retreat and welcome the Japanese-Indian army and Bose. The following is a record of his conversation: The Indian people all believe that if the British withdraw from India, they will adopt scorched-earth tactics and destroy various heavy industries. In fact, various heavy industry factories are now equipped with self-destruct devices. Indians are extremely opposed to this move by the British, and there are already widespread complaints. At present, public utilities such as electricity, water, and railways are exclusively occupied by British capitalists. If the British retreat and Bose arrives in India, these industries will be invested by Indians, so they all hope that the British will retreat. Heavy industrialists believe that there is a need for the heavy industry of Japan and the infant industry of India to coexist and prosper together. If the British leave, Japan will definitely be able to provide assistance and help it develop. Therefore, they hope that the British will retreat.</p>
<h3>Gandhi's Illness Worsens</h3>

<h3>New Mass Grave of 10,000 People Discovered in Northern Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 17th – Several mass graves of 10,000 people have been discovered near Ula, between Vitebsk and Polotsk. The mayor of Ula said that in June 1941, about 2,000 Latvians were killed by the Soviet secret police and thrown into these graves. Most of them were upper-class people and many women and children. Most of these victims came from the city of Memel. When they arrived near Ula at the end of June, they were exhausted from hunger, thirst, and fever. They were shot dead by the Soviet secret police with machine guns in broad daylight. Two days later, nearby residents were forced to bury these unfortunate Latvians. After the German army recently swept through the area, the people reported it to the German authorities, and these burial sites were discovered. The German authorities have organized a special team to excavate these graves.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th – In order to thoroughly assist in promoting the work of increasing production, and to practically supervise cooperative branches at all levels in engaging in the organization of production-increasing machinery, the rectification of production-increasing facilities, and the instruction of important tasks in order to complete this year's production-increasing plan, the Cooperative Enterprise Association of the Executive Yuan plans to send personnel to Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuhu, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other six major regions in the near future to conduct on-site investigation and inspection, and plans to provide guidance. It is reported that they will depart from Beijing in the near future and gather in Zhenjiang before heading to various places.</p>
<h3>Reforming Provincial Administrative Agencies Benefits Health Undertakings, Interview with Director Lu of the Health Department</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th – The provincial administrative agencies have been reformed, and the Economic, Food, Social Welfare Bureaus, and the Propaganda and Health Departments have all been abolished. In order to understand the situation of health matters in the provinces after the abolition of the provincial health departments, the reporter visited Director Lu of the Health Department, who said: The Yuan has resolved to abolish the health departments and change them to be handled by the provincial political affairs halls, with the provincial governor directly responsible for them. The observation and facilities are certain to be quite appropriate, and are actually much closer compared to the days when the health departments existed. The purpose of strengthening health at the county level will not be interrupted as a result. The opportunity for this department to discuss with the provinces from time to time based on its authority will not be alienated as a result. There is no better method than this. During this period of epidemic prevention, the relationship is very important. It is hoped that all personnel involved in epidemic prevention and social groups assisting in the work will continue to work as usual. It is important to know that after the change to handling by the political affairs hall, the rate will be stronger than before, and we must work harder to achieve complete success. Under the wartime system, reforming administrative agencies is bound to be done as well as possible. From the beginning to the end, there is still a need for the political affairs hall to work hard during the six-month trial period. However, the world's health undertakings depend on gradual implementation in peacetime, so as to eliminate the effects of the work invisibly and unknowingly. Moreover, the cost is also twice as high as other undertakings, because it can only improve people's health and does not directly increase production, so people often neglect it and regard it as insignificant. This is the reason for China's backward health, and it lies here. Recently, the administration of health has been handled by the provinces, and the provinces have also gained an understanding of the importance of health. Therefore, the future of health is greatly promising, so it is said that this reform of agencies is of great benefit to health undertakings.</p>

<h3>Soviet Army Prepares to Launch Large-Scale Offensive - Frequent Soviet Troop Movements on Old Polish Border</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: From the German perspective, it is unknown whether the Soviet summer offensive will be launched simultaneously in several locations. One of the most important goals of the Soviet Command is likely the advance of the Southern Route Army through Galati towards the Romanian oil fields. The German army's resistance in Crimea has allowed the German defenses on the Dniester, Prut, and Siret fronts to be strengthened calmly, and the Soviet army has failed to gain a springboard for future offensives. The current lull on the Eastern Front is actually the calm before the storm. When the Allied forces carry out large-scale activities in Western Europe, the Soviet army will also launch a large-scale offensive and is currently actively preparing.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - Well-informed German sources predict that the Soviet army will launch a major offensive on the central Kovel River earlier than expected, breaking through to the south, as the Soviet army has concentrated a large force in the area. The second point is approximately the Kowel area, as Soviet troop movements are also frequent in that area.</p>

<h3>17 Enemy Ships Sunk - Rear Admiral Yoshikawa Receives Special Honor</h3>
<p>During the Battle of Bali in February of Showa 17 (1942), the Japanese Navy 8th Destroyer Division encountered a powerful enemy fleet and fought against overwhelming odds. In late November of the same year, during the Battle of Guadalcanal, the reinforcement unit destroyed a superior enemy fleet in the waters off Lunga, fully demonstrating the attacking spirit of the Japanese Navy's mine warfare unit. The Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet had previously awarded letters of commendation for these two battles. Lieutenant Commander Yoshikawa, captain of the destroyer, made the greatest contribution in these two battles. On November 24th of last year, Lieutenant Commander Yoshikawa engaged the enemy's combined fleet commander in the waters west of Bougainville. In order to commend his outstanding achievements, the matter was reported to the Emperor, who ordered that he be promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral, which was announced by the Ministry of the Navy on May 1st. This is truly the highest honor for a destroyer fleet captain. According to Naval Captain Nakano Minoru, an associate of Rear Admiral Yoshikawa from his time at the Naval Academy, Rear Admiral Yoshikawa's combat record is as follows:</p>
<p>As a destroyer captain in the mine warfare unit, the Rear Admiral was renowned in the military for his courageous fighting. He participated in a total of 35 battles, large and small, and achieved great results each time. He sank a total of 17 enemy ships, including 6 cruisers, 10 destroyers, and 1 submarine. He often opened the door to victory in various battles and single-handedly repelled 641 enemy aircraft. His remarkable achievements made him the center of admiration for the entire fleet. On November 24th of last year, after completely transporting army troops to Bougainville Island, on the way back, the ship encountered an enemy cruiser squadron in the sea 57 nautical miles west of the island. The destroyer unit, consisting of eight ships, immediately launched a close-quarters attack, breaking into the enemy formation amidst a hail of bullets. He died heroically. According to the report of an officer from a friendly ship, the ship encountered enemy units and engaged them in battle, followed by a large explosion. The Rear Admiral and all the crew members perished with the ship.</p>
<p>Life Experiences in Dozens of Battles</p>
<p>The Rear Admiral often used the phrase "dedicate myself to the sovereign and the country" as his motto, which was the consistent creed of his entire life. This loyalty was unequivocally proven in his glorious combat record in various battles. The most intense of these battles were the Battle of Bali, the Third Battle of the Solomon Islands, and Troki.</p>
<p>In the Battle of Bali, the Rear Admiral, as the destroyer captain of the mine warfare unit, protected the landing of army troops on Bali Island. While patrolling the Lombok Strait east of the island, he encountered a US-Dutch joint fleet composed of 2 cruisers and 3 destroyers. He immediately sank 2 destroyers and severely damaged another, while the rest fled in panic. Cruisers had the mission of attacking destroyers, but the Rear Admiral actually engaged an enemy fleet composed of 3 destroyers and 2 cruisers with his warship, sinking two of them and severely damaging one. His great achievement fully proved the Rear Admiral's conviction and courage.</p>
<p>In the Third Battle of the Solomon Islands, from late August to mid-November, under enemy air supremacy, the Rear Admiral undertook the important transportation mission and was able to land successfully. During this period, he and friendly ships cooperated to sink one enemy cruiser and one enemy destroyer. When the Third Battle of the Solomon Islands occurred, the Rear Admiral was the destroyer captain of the vanguard unit of our fleet. After discovering the enemy fleet, he immediately informed the entire army and unexpectedly broke into the enemy fleet, sinking two enemy large cruisers and severely damaging one large cruiser and one destroyer. The Rear Admiral held the determination that "one cannot catch tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den," causing the enemy fleet to be limited to chaos and opening the door to victory in this sea battle.</p>
<p>Completing the Mission and Heroically Sacrificing His Life</p>
<p>Last November, the enemy launched a full-scale offensive on Bougainville Island in the Central and South Pacific. The Japanese Navy inflicted great damage on enemy ships in five air battles over Bougainville Island, but the enemy still landed on the island regardless. The Japanese army fought bravely, and the Rear Admiral undertook the extremely difficult transportation mission in this battle. He completed the mission in the first and second attempts but heroically sacrificed his life on the way back.</p>
<p>The Rear Admiral was a descendant of the Yoshikawa clan of the former Iwakuni Prefecture. He received a good family education from an early age, was honest, robust, and possessed the spirit of an ancient warrior. He was intelligent, loyal, filial, and had a bright and cheerful demeanor, and was loved by all. He always stepped forward in times of trouble. Since entering the Navy more than 20 years ago, he has always served in the Yongshen combat unit and on destroyers, seeking to break the Washington Conference's Five. It is truly the existence of God. (Translated by Xiang from the May 2nd Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>The City Celebrates the 39th Japanese Navy Day With Grandeur - Five Days of Grand Programs</h3>
<p>This month's 27th marks the 39th Japanese Navy Day. As the decisive battle stage approaches, looking back at past victories is particularly significant. To celebrate this historic commemorative occasion, Chinese and Japanese groups in this city have decided to hold various grand programs on the commemorative day and the five days around it. The details of the implementation were finalized on the 17th. The commemorative programs this time will focus on strength and simplicity. In terms of film, in addition to "The Battle of Hawaii and Malaya" and "Records of Victory of the Imperial Navy," there will also be a film of the sinking of an enemy transport ship taken by a special correspondent of the Japan Film Corporation while serving in the Indian Ocean on an Imperial submarine, which will also be shown publicly, entitled "Sinking." In addition, the Navy Art Popularization Association will hold the "Greater East Asia War Navy Art Exhibition" in the Continental Gallery of the Continental News. The Shen Bao and Continental News will jointly hold the "Chinese Ancient Liao Exhibition" at the Cathay Hotel. The detailed programs are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Celebration Programs</p>
<p>The Cultural Film Hall will hold a lecture and film event for one week, from the 24th to the 31st, showing the feature film "Records of Victory of the Imperial Navy," totaling nine volumes. On the afternoon of the 24th, from 8 PM to 10 PM, the City Education Bureau and the China Film Company will jointly hold a commemorative lecture and film event at the Great China Theater, showing the feature film "The Battle of Hawaii and Malaya," and invite Chinese teachers and staff.

<h3>Lighting Control Measures Improved - Efforts to Prevent Light Leakage - Civil Defense Corps Implement Air Defense Training</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of permanent lighting control in this city on March 3rd, the results have been good. The Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters, in order to allow citizens to handle their usual affairs normally, and also because it is now summer, when windows should be hung with air-raid blackouts, causing discomfort and heat, have re-amended the lighting control measures, which were officially announced yesterday (17th). However, the public must still pay attention at all times to prevent light leakage. In addition, the Citizen Air Defense Headquarters, in order to strengthen and perfect the special defense corps of major buildings and factories, so as to cope with emergencies, is paying special attention to intensifying air defense training for the members of each special defense corps. Since the 9th of this month, major buildings and factories have been ordered to automatically carry out various exercises of air defense measures at any time and send personnel to guide them in order to become proficient, and to seek to achieve contact and complement each other, so as to make the city's air defense organization perfect.</p>
<p>Air Defense Song Has Been Set to Music and Recorded</p>
<p>The Citizen Air Defense Headquarters of the Shanghai Special Municipality, in order to awaken the air defense awareness of all citizens of the city, and to promote the determination of 5 million citizens to actively defend Shanghai, previously requested the assistance of this newspaper to solicit air defense songs from the citizens of the city. Now that the solicitation has been in progress for a considerable period of time, a total of 111 lyrics have been received, many of which are excellent. Liang Xiuyu, Chen Binhe, and Sun Lifu were invited to serve as review committee members to evaluate and adopt them. As a result, Jin Yugu's work was considered the best (the lyrics and ranking have been published in this newspaper) and was selected as the air defense song, and the renowned composer Liang Leyin was invited to compose the music. Thanks to Mr. Liang's efforts, he came up with a wonderful tune. The Air Defense Headquarters will soon hold a music society to play the selected song. In addition to being included in the air defense film currently being produced by the China Film Company, it is also planned to record it on a record and use radio broadcasting to promote it, so that the selected masterpieces are popularized throughout the city, in order to awaken the citizens of Shanghai, who are living in a decisive battle under the permanent battlefield, to the awareness of air defense, and to consolidate their determination to win the final victory in the Greater East Asia War. It is deeply hoped that all sectors of the public will provide assistance.</p>

<p>The above totals 61,000 yuan, bringing the total collected to 828,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Necessity of a Central Advisory Body - Opinions on the Municipal Advisory Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee has decided to establish five subcommittees on daily necessities, public order, finance, education, and rural areas to jointly promote Shanghai's municipal administration, as reported in the previous newspaper. The clarification of its nature and function was eagerly awaited by the general public at the beginning of its establishment. Insiders and outsiders alike have argued that "the use of advisory forms of public opinion activity for Shanghai's municipal administration will ultimately not break the severe earthquake situation in Shanghai. We should re-establish a public opinion organ that is adapted to Shanghai's reality and can gather the total power of the general population." Therefore, the future direction of the Advisory Committee's activities is worthy of attention. Regarding this reform theory, some people also advocate that a public opinion organ for the central government should be established, which is different from the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Organ. Here is a summary of the criticisms of the Advisory Committee from all sides, summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1. Regarding the general political and economic situation in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Government, which is a local government, what position did it occupy in the past, and what position will it occupy in the future? This is the most important issue to be strictly examined at this time. Because of the importance of Shanghai's political, economic, and cultural status, Shanghai's politics should be determined by a strong central government, rather than being controlled by the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<p>For example, there is the Commodity Control Commission directly under the Executive Yuan for commodity control, the Rice Control Commission directly under the Executive Yuan for rice control, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Reserve Bank for the financial sector, and the Ministry of Industry for the business sector, each of which is responsible for its political responsibilities. Central politics has a very large direct impact on Shanghai.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we truly want to rebuild Shanghai, instead of setting up an advisory body for the municipal government, it is better to set up an advisory body for the central government first. Otherwise, the nature of this organ is somewhat incomplete.</p>
<p>2. At a symposium held on the 12th to invite Chinese and Japanese press corps, Standing Committee member Chen Binci immediately stated on behalf of the Standing Committee: "The activities of the Subcommittee on Daily Necessities are the most important among the five subcommittees." To revive Shanghai's economy, five points must be reformed immediately:</p>
<p>A. Adopting control methods suitable for China's national conditions and public sentiment,</p>
<p>B. Simplifying controls</p>
<p>C. Eliminating corruption and profiteering,</p>
<p>D. Full cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese authorities,</p>
<p>E. Active cooperation of the public with the authorities,</p>
<p>These five points are almost all central issues that the Shanghai Municipal Government cannot solve.</p>
<p>It is heard that the Advisory Committee is working hard to solve the rice and fuel problem. On the rice issue, the Shanghai Municipal Government only handles the allocation of food rice assigned by the Rice Control Commission.</p>
<p>However, if Shanghai's rice problem is not solved first, the purchase problem in various parts of the country cannot be solved at all. The Rice Control Commission is an organ directly under the Executive Yuan, and the rice problem is a national problem. Therefore, the inquiry on this issue should, of course, be directly to the central government. Control should be simplified, and inquiries should also be simplified. Intermediate indirect negotiations through the municipal government only make things more complicated. The fuel issue is even more so. The decision on the coal problem rests entirely on the central government's political policies, and the municipal government can only submit hopes to the central government.</p>
<p>3. Most of the 25 advisory committee members participate in three or four subcommittees. This greatly hinders their concentration of responsibility and effort on one issue. In addition, the Education Committee includes current university presidents such as Zhao Zhengping and Shen Siliang, but Zhu Boquan, Lin Kanghou, Chen Riping, and others, or financial figures who were teachers in the past, have also joined the committee as financial figures who have become current school "wives." However, in a committee like the Education Committee, incumbent educators should account for an absolute majority, so the real representatives of teachers from large, medium, and small schools in this city should participate as committee members. Simply using celebrities as committee members makes some intellectuals criticize the Advisory Committee as "fishing for fame and reputation." At the beginning of its establishment, the Advisory Committee should thoroughly conduct self-criticism. (Translated by Xiang: from the May 16th Continental News)</p>
<h3>Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Suzhou, Wuxi and Other Places: New Cocoons to be Evaluated Within the Month; Evaluation Price Up to 6,000 Yuan Per Dan</h3>
<p>This year, the spring cocoons in the Jiangzhe provinces production areas are about to enter the market. The Ministry of Industry has held a cocoon price evaluation meeting a few days ago and decided on the purchase price: 6,000 yuan for dry cocoons that can be reeled into 380 jin of silk. Other prices will be determined based on this standard price. It is learned that various silk factories have sent personnel to various production areas to purchase cocoons. It is heard that new cocoons in the Hangzhou area will enter the market for evaluation on the 19th of this month, Jiaxing area will start evaluation on the 23rd, Suzhou will start weighing on the 26th or 27th, and Wuxi will also start weighing in early next month.</p>
<p>(Another News) The cocoon purchasing loan syndicate organized by 15 banks in this city has provided cocoon purchasing loans. It has signed a 50 million yuan loan contract with various silk factories in this city and has already started using it. Now, the cocoon purchasing funds of various silk factories are still insufficient. Therefore, on the 15th (previous day), another 20 million yuan cocoon purchasing loan was established. The interest rate and loan method are still the same as before.</p>
<h3>Henan Operations Advance Rapidly, Chongqing Suffers Serious Blow; Spokesperson of Japanese Army Reporting Department Speaks</h3>
<p>The reporting department of the Japanese Army stationed in Shanghai held a routine press conference at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 17th) at the Hu Hotel on the Bund outside Nanjing Road. Lieutenant Sakamoto and Trustee Akahoshi of the reporting department attended. The spokesperson of the reporting department gave a detailed account of the success of the Henan operation and the operation in Imphal, India. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Fall of Luoyang is Imminent</p>
<p>The success of the Henan operation shows that the Japanese army is advancing rapidly, exceeding the planned time. It not only panicked the Chongqing side, but also frightened the British and Americans. After the Japanese army in North China crossed the Yellow River and began to attack, it took only about three weeks, and the Japanese army in Central China also began to act in Xinyang to launch a joint attack. In just nine days, the Japanese army in Central and North China joined forces in Queshan, thus opening up the Pinghan Railway. Therefore, the progress this time was surprisingly rapid, far beyond the expectations of the Chongqing spokesperson. The spokesperson then added: From a military point of view, opening up the Pinghan Railway is the completion of the first stage of the Henan operation. The Chongqing army, which retreated from the front line of the defensive position on the Yellow River, obtained reinforcements from Tang Enbo's army in Mixian and Yuxian and still tried to struggle to launch a counterattack. However, this counterattack was only a desperate act, which made the Japanese army's annihilation operation more favorable. We can understand this by observing the war results announced by the Japanese headquarters. He then mentioned that the main position of the Chongqing army in the second line of defense, the Funiu Mountain, was heavily surrounded by the Japanese detachment on the left wing and is being annihilated in various places. On the other hand, the Chongqing army led by Jiang Dingwen near Luoyang was also surrounded and annihilated by the Japanese army attacking Sishui and Mixian. Therefore, the fall of Luoyang is imminent.</p>
<p>Chongqing Severely Threatened</p>
<p>Luoyang is the strategic city of Chongqing and an important military and political stronghold for Chongqing's "resistance." The first goal of the Henan operation is to eliminate the entire combat strength of Chongqing's first line. As for opening up the Pinghan Railway, it is only a byproduct of this operation. Jiang Dingwen, commander of the First War Zone, suffered a terrible defeat this time and is still trying to reorganize his remnants to reverse the decline. Tang Enbo's main force, about a dozen divisions, is currently in a state of chaos. Even when Jiang Dingwen received Chiang Kai-shek's strict order to defend Luoyang, Luoyang was in a state where it could not be defended. He was forced to abandon the strategy of defending Luoyang. Jiang himself fled first, hoping to prepare for efforts on the third line of defense. From this, it can be seen that the Chongqing army's low quality and loss of morale in this operation are even more obvious. Therefore, the Japanese army has not only achieved military victory, but also has significant meaning in other respects. The Japanese army has captured a lot of war trophies and prisoners, especially those who come to surrender. The Chongqing army in the Henan operation was mostly Tang Enbo's most elite troops, which he himself admitted, but this defeat is a serious threat to Chongqing. In other war zones, the Chongqing army is divided and the command is not unified. They mainly focus on defending their own positions and will never provide assistance when friendly forces are in danger. Finally, the spokesperson said: Currently, some people in Chongqing advocate abandoning the encirclement operation of Hu Zongnan's army, which is encircling the Communist army, in order to quickly rescue the crisis in Henan. The incompetence of the Chongqing military generals is likely to cause the British and Americans to re-examine the possibility of providing assistance and utilizing the Chongqing regime in the future. On the other hand, it has also caused endless disputes between internal peace advocates and "resistance" factions, which will benefit peace from now on. Opening up the Pinghan Railway this time will not only make the logistics in North and Central China smoother but also stabilize the political situation and ensure public security, which is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Imphal Under Encirclement</p>
<p>The spokesperson then announced the status of the operation in Imphal, saying that the Japanese army has encircled the enemy British and Indian Fourth Army there and is launching a fierce attack to completely destroy them. The Japanese army's offensive has completely cut off the enemy's land supply route and changed from a plane war to a three-dimensional war. Although the enemy is trying to supply by air, the enemy's forces surrounded by the Japanese army amount to about 60,000 people, so even if the enemy provides supplies by air, it will be of no avail. The enemy's only reliable mechanized unit is now out of gasoline and cannot move. Tanks are abandoned on the road every day. From April 5 to May 5, the Japanese army shot down as many as 98 enemy transport planes.</p>
<p>Attempted Crossing of the Nu River Has Been Defeated</p>
<p>The attempted crossing of the Nu River by Yunnan forces on the 12th of this month was defeated by the Japanese army, shattering their attempt. On April 27, the Yunnan-Chongqing expeditionary force also attempted to cross the river, but was immediately wiped out by the Japanese army. This time, they attempted to revive the ashes, but the Japanese army swept them away and is now attacking the fleeing remnants. Regarding the Yunnan expeditionary force's attempt, it was due to the fact that the American and Chongqing forces under Stilwell in northern Burma and the British and Indian forces in India did not cooperate and showed no support, which was criticized internally and externally. This time, the attempt to cross the Nu River was regarded as the last joint operation of the allied forces. The spokesperson also said that the residents of Zhengzhou and other places occupied by the Japanese army are living in peace and are deeply grateful for peace. They are maintaining local public security and striving for construction, which is progressing rapidly. Finally, he praised the unique characteristics of the Japanese army before and after this operation, saying that they have strict discipline, are friendly to the people, and are friendly and kind, so the people are at ease and never disturbed.</p>
<h3>Reader's Aid to Education News</h3>
<p>The Vocational Guidance Lecture Scholarship Office and the Social Service Office jointly organized the Vocational Guidance Lecture, which was held from 8:00 AM on the 14th. More than 500 graduating students from various schools attended, including 30% from universities and 70% from high schools, and 50% of the students receiving scholarships. The lecturers were Pei Ziqing, Pan Yangyao, Huang Xige, Xu Changqing, Lu Meiseng, and Chen Qingshi. First, Dr. Shen Youqian, director of this office, gave an opening speech and introduced each lecturer one by one. The lecturers taught patiently, emphasizing both theory and practice, and everyone listened attentively, with continuous applause.</p>
<p>Urgent Request for School Information: In mid-April, this office sent a "Survey Form for Information on Schools at All Levels" to major primary and secondary schools in this city, requesting that they be filled out and returned for reference.

<h3>New Automobile Permits; Director Ye of the Public Utilities Bureau Speaks</h3>
<p>Director Ye Xuesong of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau spoke to reporters yesterday on the issue of automobile restrictions in this city, saying: "Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this bureau has formulated measures to restrict the use of automobiles in order to save materials, and has strictly cracked down on those who do not need to use them. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. However, recently, people who do not understand the restrictions have been applying for permits, which has caused many complications. It should be known that as the decisive stage of the war approaches, the saving of materials is even more urgent than before. Therefore, in the future, the issuance of new automobile permits will be temporarily suspended."</p>
<h3>Second Police Bureau Thoroughly Investigates: Two Gambling Dens Reopen</h3>
<p>After the six major gambling dens in the Nanshi area were ordered to close, there were rumors of attempts to revive them, but no such thing had been implemented. However, recently, rumors have resurfaced that the gambling dens run by Huamin and Lüshi have secretly reopened. Every day from 10:00 PM to the next morning, gamblers are allowed to enter the den to gamble. After receiving the report, the Second Police Bureau of the city believed that since it had been explicitly banned, how could it be allowed to reopen? This is a violation of government orders, so it immediately ordered the local branch to thoroughly investigate and report.</p>

<h3>Strengthening the Organization of Trade Associations</h3>
<p>— Shui Zhaoxiong</p>
<p>It has been a year since the reorganization and establishment of trade associations. There is much to be said about the quality of their achievements and the speed of their progress.</p>
<p>The trade association itself has no independent work. All the tedious tasks are busy with undertaking and relaying, so some people laugh that the association is a trust with a small capital and a large scope. Although undertaking and relaying is necessary; how to enrich yourself, how to maintain independence, is an urgent task; this is the step that should be taken from temporary to permanent. For example, running a school for children of the same industry, running a technical school for the same industry; establishing an obligation treatment center for the same industry, supplementing the moral and intellectual cultivation of the same industry with a regularly published publication and academic lectures; holding various military entertainment and various sports trips at any time to improve the noble interests of the same industry and increase physical education. Establishing cooperative societies or cooperative banks for the welfare of employees in the same industry, etc.</p>
<p>At present, the trade association and its members are under the heavy supervision of Shu Zhong, and it is said that they have to do the public affairs of undertaking and relaying, and they have the suffering of being disagreeable on all sides. For example: those belonging to the municipal government have the Economic Bureau; those belonging to the First District Office have the Economic Department; those belonging to the First Police Bureau have the Economic Section. Recently, an Economic Security Department has been created. In terms of commercial political organizations with the same nature, there are the Commercial Coordination Association and its affiliated associations, etc. In addition to this port, there are also the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Construction, the National Economic Commission, and the tax authorities of the Ministry of Finance, which can directly instruct and instruct. To be more intimate and sincere, the trade association has so many superiors who take care of it. However, there are also the sufferings of being unable to pay due to the multiplicity of institutions and the lack of political orders. Therefore, I believe that in the future, the industrial and commercial management institutions must be adjusted and unified by the authorities as soon as possible, reducing the complexity of the stacked racks, and making the organization systematic and simplified, then the efficiency of the trade association can be improved, and the county merchants will also be blessed.</p>
<p>At present, the directors and supervisors of various trade associations are indeed qualified and learned, but there are also many who fill the ranks with incompetence and use wealth as a cover. Secondly, many of the employees of the association are indeed learned, experienced, and capable, but there are also many who are empty, outdated, and incompetent. I believe that if we want to strengthen economic control, we must strengthen the personnel of trade associations. On the one hand, we should strictly stipulate the minimum qualifications of the candidates for directors and supervisors, and secondly, we should increase the responsibility of each director and supervisor so that those who are elected are not honorary positions of ease, but must make actual achievements. As for the employment of association employees, it is best to incorporate examinations into the employment process, so that we can get real talents.</p>
<p>Letter to My Sister (1)</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>— Translated by Iwata Hiroshi</p>
<p>Several days have passed since I was told by Mr. Tsuruhara at the yakitori restaurant in Koenji: "Well then, you are a nerve teacher - a pure scripture weakness."</p>
<p>Mr. decided to ask the minister for a week off. The reason was just for rest.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr.'s worrying behavior had already been noticed, so no one was surprised by his request for leave.</p>
<p>"Young people from the countryside will always be like this once. This is the soil and water disease of Gyeonggi. Well then, take a good rest!"</p>
<p>After saying this, the minister gave a small amount of travel expenses. One of his colleagues said:</p>
<p>"Where are you going to rest?"</p>
<p>"Not sure yet."</p>
<p>"Really freehand! Then I'll tell you a good place. A place near the house that doesn't cost money and is suitable for rest is the coast."</p>
<p>After saying this, he wrote down the car to take on the way and a letter of introduction to the inn and handed it to Mr..</p>
<p>Mr. didn't care about the sea or the mountains, as long as it was quiet and cheap, any place would do. So without much thought, he decided to go to the coast called Kurihama.</p>
<p>The next morning, he took a fire train from Koenji to Shinagawa, and then took the Shonan train to Uraga. The setting sun in autumn radiated faint light from the large glass window. While taking a peek at the newspaper being read by the person next to him, the big topic of the first air raid on Yunnan was printed on it in special characters.</p>
<p>(It's still good to take a break...,) Mr. thought as he sat in the train car. This trip had no taste of travel, but it had more sense than accompanying Mr. Ichirai to go to Kyushu for a sketching trip.</p>
<p>At this time, the scenery outside was land and land - people with no edge in sight. After passing Yokohama, it was an endless plain. In the distance, the blue sea was sparkling.</p>
<p>(That's Tokyo, huh, this is completely like a river east</p>
<p>He had always despised Tokyo Bay, which didn't look like the sea. So he recalled the wide sea and high mountains of his hometown, and felt endless sadness. Therefore, the constant homesickness emerged in his heart.</p>
<p>(When I was in a completely helpless situation, I once agreed to write a letter to my sister. Now is the time to write a letter.)</p>
<p>He was exhausted and felt that everything was tasteless. So he thought that the only way to fire back to Kagoshima, beg his parents for forgiveness, and apologize to his relatives and friends, there was no other way.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, the scenery outside the window changed. The short mountains gradually approached his eyes. The road was very winding. Suddenly, unexpectedly, a scene appeared in his eyes.</p>
<p>Social Service</p>
<h3>Mr. Shan Yunhui's Father Donates 150,000 Yuan for Public Welfare, Which is Admirable</h3>
<p>Mr. Shan Yunhui wrote a letter yesterday saying: "My father received 150,000 yuan of medical loss expenses from Mr. Xian Shi Rong and his brother Deqi. My father did not want to accept it, and donated all the money to charity. I am sending a check here and hope you will accept it. In addition to donating 20,000 yuan to your organization's midwifery fund in response, the remaining funds will be used by your organization for distribution to various charitable organizations to serve as education funds. I hope you will be satisfied."</p>
<p>Mr. Hui Guang is currently the manager of Dahongyun Restaurant, Hongqing Restaurant, Daqingguan, Hushan Soap Factory, China Flying Fast Transportation Company, and the executive director of the Shanghai Municipal Restaurant Industry Association. In addition to devoting himself to his own duties, he is also devoted to social welfare and relief for the poor and sick. Mr. Jianbin, his father, is a senior in the restaurant industry, with a benevolent and charitable heart. He is always ready to help friends and relatives in need. He is a model of public service. Now, he has donated the loss expenses given by friends to charitable organizations, and his enthusiasm for public welfare is admirable." In addition to complying with the request, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the poor people who will benefit. The list of donations is recorded below. It is hoped that each group will issue an official receipt as soon as possible after seeing the report in the newspaper and collect it from this office to meet Mr. Shan's expectations. The details are as follows: 20,000 yuan for the poor women's midwifery fund, 10,000 yuan each for the Chinese Religious Ethical Conference, Wuyi Mountain Villa, Poor Children's Craft Institute, Children's Welfare Association, Nursing Home, and Sacred Mother Church. 5,000 yuan each for Small Loans and Medical Aid Funds. 3,000 yuan each for the Jianlun Library, the People's Women's Hospital, the Red Swastika Society Congee Yard, the Nanshi People's Hospital, the Bo'ai Hospital, the Andang Hospital, the People's Obstetrics Hospital, the Shanghai Health Association, and the Zhenxin Epidemic Prevention Institute, Tongren Fuyuan Hall. 2,000 yuan each for Fuyou Institute, the Christian Orphanage, the Qiying Association, the Nursing Industrial Children's Institute, the Disaster Children's Shelter, the Ren Shan Nursing Institute, the Renji Nursing Hall, Tushan Bay, Bosgao, Emmanuel, Bethel, Bethany, and foreign orphanages such as Yangjingbang, and the Yigong of the Women's Christian Association, and the Nüguang Welfare Agency.</p>
<h3>Chinese Science Society: Lecture Training Course</h3>
<p>The Chinese Science Society believes that in order to cultivate righteous patriots, we must start with the study of basic science, and mathematics is especially important. It has long had the ambition to open a lecture course. Fortunately, Mr. Zu Heng, the administrator of Hengtong Yarn Factory and Zhenxing Woolen Factory, undertook the scientific lecture and publication expenses. Therefore, it has gathered many mathematics experts among the society friends in Shanghai, and has established a mathematics training course at the Shanghai Society located at 523 Xianyang (Yalta) Road, inviting students above the second grade of university and those with equivalent academic ability to register for lectures. Registration will be open from the 1st to the 20th of each month, and lectures will begin at the end of the month. Articles of Association are available and will be mailed upon request.</p>
