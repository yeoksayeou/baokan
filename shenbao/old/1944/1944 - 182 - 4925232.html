<h3>社評　米價經不起刺激</h3>
<p>七月一日起，米紙會開始實旅征購及發照辦法，經過三日，米價黑市又暴漲百分之四五十，這是事實。上次行政院頒布京滬兩市民食米臨時措置綱耍，及米統會及市府公布上海民食米管理暫行辦法以後，米價卽趨狂漲，其後市政府公布暫緩實施，米價一度稍回以至靜止，也是最近的事實·一般見解，征購與發照辦法的實行，足以刺激米價，現在果然不出所料。我們認為米價已至如此嚴重地步，唯一的急要是使之安定，不能再使刺激，這在米統會本身一定知道，可是，偏偏這樣做，誠是百思莫解。</p>
<p>目前秋收將屆，產地陳米存底均薄，征購一事，實已不合時宜。而五斗以下，亦須領取證單，更是多此一舉，證明了怎樣？不證明叉怎樣？須知多一層手續，就多一層麻煩，也就多一層為不肖者施技的機會。本月二日新聞報經濟社論提出的對於米政三點希望：　征購價格不能過低，壓得過低，則米商運入之米，除征購外，如不得自由買賣，將無人願意搬運五斗以上來滬，上海食米供求勢必失調。除征購之外，如得自由買賣，則米主失之於應徵部分者，必將求償於自由買賣部分，上海米價必再起漲風。　米統會發照處辦事人員應嚴加管理，取締延宕留難，祚欺　索行為，市政諮詢會應派員巡視，協助當局監督。　同滑五斗以下米之搬入，嚴禁沿途軍警留靴勒索，都很切要。</p>
<p>總而言之，上海的米價問題猶如患二期肺病的病人，希望病情好轉，惟有充分休息與營養，使其由安定而漸漸轉機。如果不顧事實偏講不合理的衛生理論，使之深呼吸囉，運動　，冷水浴囉，種種刺激，則必致轉入三期肺病而至嚴重不可收拾。</p>
<p>我們緊急主張，唯有安定現狀，不使再有新的刺激。全國商業統制總會經最近調整以後，米統會是在商統會之下，實施統制工作的五個委員會之一，受商統會指導監督。所以，米統會的措施，商統會也應負資。此次商統會調整後，新理事長秘書長理監事等於七月二日就職，過去都是極關心民食的工商界領袖，希望重視嚴重的米價現實問題，從速籌議合理方策，我們認為現在的米統會應從速改組，辦理結束工作。同時側重全力於準備秋收時的米糧統制方案，就是對於秋收新　登縐之時，應如何根據過去失敗的經騐，如何訂定合情合理的方案，無論征購，定價，發照，一切的一切，不能閉門造車，而須斟酌悉當。特別重要者應請商統會　選適當的主持人員，對於米業方面有經騐，有信譽，有姿望，有歷史關係者坐持辦理。</p>
<h3>蒂摩爾北方海面　炸沉敵潛艇一艘　日空軍襲必阿克島美機塲</h3>
<p>蒂摩爾三日中央社電　日轟炸機隊，一日於蒂摩爾島北方發現有敵潛艇一艘透出海面，乃即加以攻擊，該艇當即中彈爆炸，不能潛入海底，其艇自已下沉，向左方傾斜，但不久放出大量白泡，後即吿沉沒。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據墨爾缽來電，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部一日發表戰况公報稱：日空軍機隊，曾來襲新幾內亞必阿克島擊伊克梅爾機塲及奧依島美軍事設施。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　珍珠灣來電，美太平洋艦隊司令部鑿表，日空軍機隊二十九日夜復對塞班島之美軍陣地加以轟炸。</p>
<p>日軍某基地三日中央社電　北千島方面一至二日間，敵機曾三次來襲，均被日軍擊退，日方毫無損書。</p>
<h3>華南日軍發動攻勢　沿粵漢綫三路北進　與渝第七戰區軍展開激戰</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日本大本營三日下午三時牛發表，華南方面日軍各部隊，為與湖南作戰相呼應，於六月二十七日，對渝第七戰區軍，開始攻擊，沿粤漢織路北進中。</p>
<p>里斯本三織中央社電　路透社重慶電稱，廣東方面之日軍，刻已開始北進，以謀與沿粤漢綫南下之日軍，取得連絡。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據渝中央社訊，華南日軍新作戰之情形如次：粤省日軍，於六月十七日，分三路北上，開始進擊。於二十九日晨，更增强其兵力，分六路挺捉。其中有四路在　包與三水間，已强行渡過北岸，向駐於淸遠（廣州北方六十四公里，）西南約十四公里之渝軍各陣地進擊。一部日軍已向淸遠東約九公里之渝軍陣地進擊。另一部日軍則往北方推進，直迫龍荔，淪軍刻正邀擊，日眾與之展開激州，直至六月三十日，激戰仍在進行中。</p>
<h3>美訪員談日新攻勢</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據美聯社重慶訪員二日訊，說明日軍發動新攻擊之情形如次，此次作職，其規模能否及於全中國，此種問題，當視今後日軍新進繫之展開程度，即可賑然。中日事變將屆八週年，重慶當局亦正遭遇事變八年以來所未有之重大威脅，同時此次作戰，更足以予今次戰爭以重大影響，此爲一般人不得不承認者。消息界更認此次日軍北上攻擊，乃爲粉碎重慶戰略上之嚴重轉期，其結果有確保亞洲之意圖。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　華中日軍於攻略長沙後，即沿粵漢綫着着南下，直治粤漢綫中段要衝衡陽，當此衡陽行將陷落之時，華南日軍亦於六月二十七日，突然發勤攻勢，與湖南日軍呼應，沿粤漢綫北上，推進縱貫粤省北方地區之北江，及其支洗，並在各處突破淪軍防棧，該方面作戰進展極其順利。由於濁南力面日軍作戰之進展，第七戰區長官余漢謀，亦於最近感於動搖，會急謀從新配置所部兵力，但當尙未配置完備之前，即遭遇北上日軍之進擊，頓成狼狽。至此在中國戰綫肢開作戰之日軍，其新的軍事行動，已使極偉大之規模與構想，益爲明確。日軍今後應以如何之態勢發展，此固非吾人所能預測，但華南軍發日動北上作戰後，粵漢綫已充滿危縐。如粤漢綫為日軍打通，則以粤漢綫為中心之戰局，實足以明鑑大東亞戰爭之前途。由於週南作戰之進展，日軍更能打通京漢綫，而在湖南做戰中之日軍，亦於制粵漢綫之北段，打通粵漢綫之計劃，若間諸實現時，則從北京貫通廣東之中國大動脈綫，勢必落在日軍手中，此時於重慶抗戰力之影響，誠鑿重大。故今後重慶能否擔當對日軍作戰，此實成疑題。且粵漢綫之打通，更可使駐轍美空軍前進基地，如粤漢綫以東江西省之吉安，遂川，·贛州，福建省之建　，浙江省之麗水等地，勢必喪失其機能，時至今織，日中國派遣眾在中國發動之各地誘錙攻勢，實可謂以實力回答美蔣會談之表現。同時渝軍之不斷敗北，實與反軸心鑿個陣營之敗北無疑。由此而觀，日軍此次進擊，實足使反軸心陣營，頓感焦慮。</p>
<h3>密芝那附近　日軍創敵</h3>
<p>緬甸日軍前綫三日中央社電　密芝那附近之敵，自二十八日夜半開始，向日軍陣地猛攻，至二十九日並以轟炸機反復猛炸，經日軍邀擊，敵遺棄屍體多數潰逃。該方面戰鬥，截至六月十織，敵第八十九國損耗之兵力，為一七八四名，其中軍官約為九十三名，目下該方敵軍幾全被覆滅。</p>
<h3>印督華維爾　拒會見甘地</h3>
<p>仰光三日中央社電　印警華維爾拒絕甘地翁之會見耍求，足可表示甘地翁之被解放後，英印關係之發展，故此事予印政界極大衝動。緣甘地翁之對英態度，仍堅持一九四二年八月所表明之主張，且此種主張，於甘地翁之一生中，乃確固不動者，英國有鑒及此，乃拋棄過去之警戒態度，決定對甘地翁及一般反英運動之很木方針。今甘地翁之對英根本態度已日趨明顯，故今後之推移，極堪注目。</p>
<h3>陳代委長參觀　陸軍醫院</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　陸軍部陸軍醫院開辦迄今，已屆數月，工作開展至為積極。三日上午九時，軍事委員會陳代委員長，特親臨該院視察。到有軍委會總參謀長鮑文樾，陸軍部長葉　，海軍部長任援道，首都警察總監李謳一等。由裝院院長郭連城，副院長鑿慶，引導燭視該院各項機構病房等祝備，幷沼集該院全體職員醫官護士等訓話，勗勉各員努力工作。全體恭聆後，均極感奮。至九時五十分，陳代委員長始於全體恭送下離院。</p>
<h3>小倉經濟顧問　昨日抵東京　與關係當局研討要務</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電國府最高經濟顧問小倉正怔氏，三日下午抵此。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　據福岡電話，國府最高經濟顧問小倉正值氏，為報吿當地經濟情勢及與關係當局硏討要務，皺於三日下午自寨路抵此。該氏對最近之中國經濟情勢談稱，此次本人自四月中旬就任後，即屢與國府要人及財界有力者作種種懇談，並赴各地視察經濟情况。中國之經濟建設如物價對策等，雖為困難問題，但由於中國財界人士者協力，已漸有進展，今次河南作戰之勝利，更具深切之熱意，此深值欣慰。</p>
<h3>駐渝美空軍　前進基地後撤　似將移往貴陽西南</h3>
<p>日軍某基地三日中央社電　駐渝美空軍由於此次祚戰，已將前進之重要基地衡陽機塲喪失，頃更因日軍對中國西南部之多數基地加以威脅，而愈見狼狽。據最近之情報稱，註渝美空軍不僅放棄湖南省方面之機緻，即江西廣東各省之前進基地，亦有不得不放棄之槪。如零陵·寳慶·等機塲，刻殆行荒置，江西省遂川贛州新城等基地，亦限制使用，敵機從該方面出動之情事，日漸减少。惟桂林方面尚相當活躍，而敵機集合於上尉說使用柳州機場之舉，亦頗堪注目。不過近日亦正準備疏散，復因日軍由空陸雙方增大壓力面多數基地設施，移向後州方面之公路，就中韶關至八步間約二百公里之一段公路，召集附近村莊民眾，不分晝夜，加工修築，敵方狼狽情形，益形顯露。駐渝美空軍後退之方向，據推測約係貴陽西南方之淸鎭敵方，正着手整頓機場，意在使爲華南方面之最前進基地。總之駐渝美空軍以空襲日本本土為目標，由中國西南部逐，已因戰局之進展，而遭莫大影響，終於被迫將第一綫之基地，移退至貴陽山中，不過敵方野心未死，爲縮短對日攻擊之距離，刻正謀將此等基地，移至西北地區，此亦深　注目。</p>
<h3>日軍佔領衡陽車站</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　美聯重慶特派員二日報稱，日軍已佔領衡陽車站，自美軍機隊襲該軍站之點觀之，知地上戰事已在衡陽巿街內進行。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　路透社重慶特派員，二日發表衡陽戰况謂，日軍欲突入衡陽室內，于過去四十八小時內，猛加攻擊，並對防守衡陽西郊車站及公共汽率站之渝軍，投擲手溜彈。日軍一路從東方强襲市街，另一路在湘江東企圖强行渡河，日機隊猛炸死守衡陽之渝軍軍事設施，且據該巿內消息稱，落于市內之日軍砲彈炸彈聲，不絕于耳。</p>
<p>展州三日中央社電　此次湖南作戰，給于渝抗戰陳營，及在渝美空軍以極大打擊。一日質慶美聯社電，此次日軍作戰目的，在佔領華南戰略據點，而作攻擊之前哨戰，並藉以防衛尼米資之攻勢，其要旨謂日軍由滿洲至華南，確保縱貫陸上之交通，且猛然沿粤漢棧南進。據當地消息靈通者稱，日軍于該作戰圖佔領華南據點，乃展開前哨攻勢。如衡陽失陷，日軍則有直向西南進攻之可能云，日眾打通粤漢綫時，勢力必進窺孤立之福州溫州等地，如是觀之，日軍之作戰，係由攻勢中藉以防衛尼米資之太平洋攻勢。</p>
<h3>日軍需生產　步入第二期　貯蓄增強方策推進中</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　今戰局日益苛烈，日軍需生產界亦將本年度第一期渡過，開始走入第二期。自去年末以來，即先後推行以增產飛機，艦船做目標之生產行政，生產技術，生產要素，價格等，綜合生產對策，已收獲相常效果，且將職局生產之資財設備，勞力輸送力等各問題完全解決。至今第一期之軍需生產，依即定計劃已收良好成績，造船乃運軍力之基礎，亦正順利進行，輕金屬之增產，向國產原理方面之轉換等，進行亦極順利。飛機生產之速率，觀現壯戰局力量，惟有增產艦船與飛機，始爲突破戰局之大關鍵，但所謂增產，主要系在時問與速度上努力，第二期生產沉積之成敗，亦唯有依此決定。故凡日本國民莫不以冷靜沉着態度，信綴統帥與政府，一致努力，從專生產，以便生活·生產·作戰三者連貫一起，堅定信念，克服困難，犧牲自己生活，爲戰爭奮鬥，此即唯一之活路。去年度日國民貯蓄成織，已超過原定目標四十億元，自中日事變起六年有半，日本國民寧旭之增加，實超過千億元，政府為紀念此記錄，前曾於各地表　對貯蓄之有功者，本年度三百六十億元之貯蓄目標，現於全國各地域及各服務地，已展開各種促進及增强方策。欲加强貯蓄，必須有周密之計劃與組織，前於三月十日決定之「貯蓄增強方　」，即着重於此點，並規定重點指向因時局關係，收入顯著增加之部門及確立服務地貯蓄之共同賣任制等方針。為適應此方策，此次特公布服務地貯蓄協力命令，棗七年一日起實施，折又鑒於隨戰力之增强，　工及其所得即隨之增加，尤其港灣搬運與土地建築關係，自由勞動者之實際收入膨脹，於維持經濟秩序之見地吸收此等　新興所行者層之購買力，乃為當務之急，加强職域貯蓄，確立責任制，實具重大意義。今日一般輿論多已認自由勞動者，小工業於業表及在折鄕洲農居住之通勤工等層，乃持有貯蓄餘力，故為加强辦理計劃貯蓄復開一新途境。至日本之疏散對策與戰災非常對策，以加强國內防衛態勢爲目標，於資金資材勞務運輸等方面，分別綜合進行。此次關於公司職員家族疏散之補助費，戰禍臨時補給及公司之應急支出等，日政府已認可公司經理統制令中之特例。又為活用戰時特硃損害保緻及戰時死亡傷害保險，日省軍需已着手獎勵，並指導所管各工塲之全體從業員，使加入戰爭保險，一方偕此昻揚戰意，並可使空戰禍時之企業經理對策得以圓浙實施。</p>

<h3>日首相德使懇談　兩國關係益緊密　德元首日大使亦不斷會見</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日東條首相為檢討世界戰局，會於上月二十八日與德駐日大使史塔瑪舉行懇談，重光外相亦出席參加，雙方開誠懇談，無隔　交換意見。按此種會談尙係初次，歷時約三小時，首由東條首相關於大東亞職爭現况加以詳細說明後，史塔瑪大使對歐洲戰局以及目下德國軍事，政治各點，率直加以解釋。日·德兩國今後於大東氈·歐洲兩戰局下，為相共分擔責任·反擊敵之總反攻，故東條首相及史塔瑪大使之會談，實具有共同完遂戰爭之重大意義。日·德兩國為更趨緊密提携計，日駐德大島大使，亦不斷與希特勒元首會見，故今後東條首相，重光外相亦將隨時與德史塔瑪大使作連絡會談。</p>
<h3>德精銳猛烈反攻　克恩區竟日鏖戰　邱吉爾型坦克出現於戰場</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央電海通社訊：克恩西南之坦克車大戰，昨竟日進行，劇烈情勢迄未少衰。坦克軍及大砲數量之多，不亞於東戰塲，英軍雖突入德軍陣綫歡公里，而德軍則沿興登河仄攻，巳進抵凡柱農（Versonon），但局勢於過去　四小時中仍無甚變化。其　西地帶德軍大砲正猛轟陶特伐爾（Tortecal）之英坦克茲地及蒂萊之軍火庫，裝有二三·四生的口徑放射器之邱吉爾型坦克，已出現於英軍戰綫之南翼，而美軍則用噴火來復槍手溜彈。</p>
<p>侵歐前錢三日中央社電　海通社戰地記者韋勃稱：克恩西南坦克車大戰，延緻已逾一〇〇小時，迄未少衰，英第二軍平均每小時竟損失坦克車五輛，過去三十小時中英坦克車損失巳達一三六輛。英軍在海陸軍大砲掩護下，仍圖在巴隆突破其右翼之主要目標，似欲進抵克恩南之奧納河，德軍亦加緊對英坦克隊之壓迫，「希特勒靑年團」坦克師在英軍抵抗下，徐徐推進，昨日反攻又克復要地三處</p>
<h3>英軍兵力達十六師</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　海通社訊：最近數日克恩西南，德軍大砲及臼白數百尊集中砲火，猛轟鏖集於一狹隘地區內之英第二軍，該區敵有步兵及坦克車做約十師之眾，有時雙方砲戰達空前熾烈程度。德軍旣經使用臼砲，足見德軍重武器已携至强敵陣綫不遠之地，此間戰爭日漸演變爲大規模消耗戰。最近兩日開到步兵兩師及坦克車一師以齋增援後英第二軍力估計在十四師與十六師之間。桑洛戰爭亦見緊張，不久美軍有開始大戰之可能，敵眾在奧納河口登陸已遭遏止。</p>
<h3>沿岸炮火阻敵登陸</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　德軍當局二日發表：以大小艦船數百艘組成之敵上陸作戰部隊，出現於奧納河口附近海面，因德軍炮火之轟擊，阻止其上陸。</p>

<p>柏林央社電　海通社訊：統率孤軍困守約堡要塞抗戰到底之德軍司令凱爾中校，年四十六歲，為後備軍官，承平時服務稅關，此次北法戰事，凱爾大顯將才扼阻美軍於聖美爾織里斯，至奉令撤往瑟堡為止，嗣又在該牛島之西北端據壕固守，直至最後一彈。</p>
<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電　路透社西綫隨軍記者史汀本日報稱：在海牙角與所部抗戰到底之德軍中校凱爾，已與其僚屬同被俘獲，但此說尙未經其他方面證實。</p>
<p>侵歐大戰聲中英增幕傘兵</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據倫敦來電：英軍自去年秋季以來，曾中止降落傘兵之招募，茲因歐陸侵攻作戰關係，故再決定增募空輸部隊人員。</p>
<h3>義北德軍　撤離西埃那</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電德國新聞社訊，德官方發表：義境之激戰復於日昨展開，於沿岸至特拉西曼諾湖之間，敵竟日發動攻勢，德軍於激戰後，向北解脫數公里。戰事旣已追近西埃那（Siena在義北部）之南部，有損及該歷史著名古城文化紀念物之虞，故德軍已自動撤至該城之北而未受敵之氈力。亞特里亞海沿岸之敵，以强大之部驟來犯，將德眾前哨兵推入主要陣地。</p>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：週六義境防禦大戰之中心，在西埃那之西南與東南，特戈爾部隊在美坦克車掩護之下，整日迭次鍾攻，均被擊退。亞特里亞沿海，德軍之凸出點，移至坡坦査河東岸，波蘭軍迭次企圖渡河，均因死傷重大而夫敗。</p>
<h3>明斯克四週地區　大戰進行中　德軍將領三員殉國</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，據德軍發表戰報稱：東綫中路蘇軍在斯魯資克作强烈之攻擊，但經激戰後卒被擊退，奧西波維基地區貝萊錫那中部之德軍，艱苦作戰從事解脫，蘇軍則在明斯克四週之地區堅迫，普洛及戰鬥機支援下，向格魯波科萊進攻，但遭失敗，在激烈之防禦戰中，砲兵司令馬丁尼克與普斐法及蘇納曼中將皆身先士卒而戰成仁報國。</p>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：東錢中路之防禦大戰，昨仍在各焦點繼續進行。斯魯資克德軍在某一地區內，向市鎮之西進後數公里，藉以避免巷戰。波里沙夫附近蘇軍以坦克車若干編隊設法突破德軍陣綫，但結果僅使德軍將其主要陳錢向後移動約六里而已。普洛資克區亦展開質大之戰事，當時德守軍最後向城市之西部與南部邊沿撤退，然後在强大坦克車隊掩護下，擊潰蘇軍之猛攻。</p>
<h3>芬蘭灣蘇軍登陸被擊退</h3>
<p>柏林三之中央社電　芬蘭海軍一日與德快速艇隊協力，將企圖終芬蘭灣泰卡爾薩里島上陸之蘇軍粉碎。</p>
<p>赫爾辛基三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，據莫斯科廣播：斯巴斯加雅古柏城頃已被規定為「卡來里亞－芬蘭蘇維埃共和國－之首都。</p>
<h3>芬蘭爭取自由　決奮鬥到底　總理發表廣播</h3>
<p>赫爾辛基三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：芬蘭總理昨日廣播稱：芬蘭與美國斷絕外交關係，並非由於芬蘭國民或芬蘭政府之罪。在冬爭戰期內，英美均承認芬人防禦來自東方進攻之權利，當時甚至請求芬人切勿屈服。芬蘭為一民主國家，決不離其很深蒂固之民主秩序，在敵人所强迫之職鬥中，決心保衛此種秩序。芬蘭永為其領土之主人，前途雖尙有不少苦難，但芬蘭自知其對於將來之資任而勇敢應付之。</p>
<h3>反軸心加緊　壓破阿根廷　英駐美大使返國</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據傳英美兩國政府前經協商之後，曾令駐阿根廷大使歸國，頃繼之更有使美洲各國大使全部歸國之勢。據華盛頓來電，墨西哥烏拉圭兩國大使已被召返國，業已返國之古巴大使亦未返阿京，巴西尼加拉圭及其他基於不承認政第所留置之各國代理大使，亦將於數日間被召返國。佐美國是次措置，反軸心陣營對阿根廷之壓迫愈形强化。</p>
<p>瑞典三日中央社電　海通社訊、路透社息：英駐美大使哈里法克斯偕同夫人已返倫敦，將作短期逗留。據稱渠於離美前，會與美國務蜘赫爾商討英美與阿根廷之關係。</p>
<h3>華萊士　離渝返美</h3>
<p>澳門三日中央社電　海通社訊：美國報紙戰稱，美副總統華萊士訪渝之行，刻已結束，於昨日自蘭州啓程返國。</p>
<p>華中日重於五月二十七日對湖南第九戰區薛岳部隊進攻以來，與先前河南作戰一般，進行極為順利。作紙開始後二十餘日，即於六月十八日將要衝長沙及醴陸，完全佔領。</p>
<h3>分路進兵</h3>
<p>先是日軍各部隊分兵三路南下，中路沿粤漢綫，突擊敵軍正面，右翼自華容安鄕出發，渡洞庭湖向沉江益陽壯擊，左翼自崇囑通城出發，踏破萬洋山脈，進擊瀏陽，三路互相呼應，對長沙方面之敵，取包圍之勢。薜岳早知力不能勝，再三請求蔣介石派兵增援，蔣雖聲明死守長沙，但並不派逍增援，專着眼於重慶周圍的四川及西安地區的防衛，使薛岳陷於困境。但猶相信手下各部隊的戰力，故將二十八個師團中的二十五個師團，派在長沙周團，在益陽，長沙，瀏陽三綫，構築八型防衛綫，企圖牽制日軍，但經日軍猛攻結果，右翼益陽，寨鄕崩漬，長沙西側被壯斷。</p>
<p>左翼方面，瀏陽於十五日陷落，同時長沙南面粤漢綫上的株州，也入於日軍之手，長沙四周乃完全陷於包圍之中，其運命織為時間問題。不過擔任防衛長沙周圍的是薛岳軍中以最精銳見稱的第四軍，在第一次及第二次長沙作戰中有功，軍長為　德能，决意死守長沙，同時長沙市內，及其外側西方岳　山及其西面桃花山一帶，滿築碉堡與防舍，殆成為要塞化。日軍對此，不得不愼重將事，卒於十八日淸晨一度猛攻，敵軍於士氣沮喪之餘，僅支持一日，長沙遂吿陷落，敵軍十五個師團受創。</p>
<h3>日軍三陷長沙經過</h3>
<p>駐渝美空軍自始即圖作相當活動，但經日軍航空部隊先發制人，予以重大打擊，敵空軍不復能作積極活動，僅可從內地基地出發，作游擊性的空襲。</p>
<h3>三度得失</h3>
<p>長沙和洞庭做畔的常德，同為湖南省的生命中樞，尤其是長沙，乃為湖南的省會，渝方第九戰區司令部即設於此。長沙於民國三十年九月及十二月，兩次受日軍閃電式進攻，今次已為第三陷落。</p>
<p>自民國二十七年十月武漢陷落仗，質慶將湖南省大部份劃為第九戰區，配備軍隊四十萬之眾。同時，即高唱「湖南決戰」，在洞庭湖的東南部州新牆河，汨永爾岸，百公里範圍內，專纂堅强陣地。越一年半後，日軍對重建的抗戰地盤第九戰區，開始進攻，是即第一次長沙作戰。日軍於民國三十年九月十八日，出重慶不意，三度自岳州東南新牆河方面開始行動，轉瞬之間突破汨水要塞綫，作戰第十日，即將長沙迅速攻陷，至十月一日，日軍聲明恢復原狀。退出長沙。</p>
<p>同年十二月，敵方喘息未定，第二次長沙戰役又起，日軍破敵十萬之眾，直迫長沙，作戰開始後第八日即民國三十一年一月一日，再度佔領長珍。其間因第五第六戰區之敵，約二十師之眾，在長沙作戰日軍背後發動，日軍乃聲明二次誅沙作戰目的已達，聽其恢復原狀。</p>
<p>其後第九戰區又重行整備，自三十一年年底以來，高呼「冬季攻勢」口號，積極活動。去年二月，日軍對第九及第六戰區，展開春季作戰，五月間對洞庭湖北部，進行夏季作戰。更於十一月間，展開常德　滅戰，作戰三星期餘，值領常德。但自湖南作戰以來，當以今次長沙的陷落，對於重慶發生影響最爲深刻。</p>
<h3>風景物產</h3>
<p>長沙位在湘江右岸，人口三十萬，主要物產為米，茶，紙，烟草，漆，麻，木棉，桐油，磁器，木材，石炭，鐵，銻等，工業相當發展。府城為長方形，南北約二哩，東西一哩，周圍約六哩，高三丈，以石塊及煉瓦堆砌而成，堅固無比，當地人有「鐵壁城」之稱。</p>
<p>長沙不僅為古來軍事重鎮，且為著名的講學之所。往昔文人墨客，觀覽湘江洞庭湖天然風物者，相率來訪於此·故文學遺跡甚富。長沙的名勝，當以湘江對岸的岳麓山首屆一指。山中有自卑亭，愛晚亭，萬壽寺，百鶴泉，禹王碑，朱子亭，雲麗宮，望湘亭等，近代革命先烈黃興與蔡鍔二人，亦卜葬此山。山麓的岳麓書院爲昔年朱熹天下四大書院之一，現在改為師範學校。（譯自六月二十一日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>商統會聞理事長談　改善物資統制　軍需供應不能與民生相悖</h3>
<p>國民政府行政院為强化物贅統制，改組全國商掌統制總會，特派聞　亭氏為理事長，業已於本月一日到會接任。中央社記者　訪聞氏，承發表今後物資統制改善方針談話如次：</p>
<p>「此次奉令出長商統會，原以年邁力衰未敢應命，但旣承政府及盟邦當局尊諄相勉，亦覺義不容辭。際茲商統會進行改組，州往追來，各方期待殊股，吾人自當就力之所及，環境之所許，黽勉以赴。</p>
<h3>物資統制收效匪易</h3>
<p>惟尙有不能不向各位告者，查商統會以協助整蠱施行國策為宗旨，某業務為承政府命令辦理物資統制事宜，責任殊見綦重。惟商統會本身為商業集體自治機構，欲執行物資統制工作，非獲得各方充分協助，極難收效。我國人民數十年來，所度經濟生活，素尙自然，驟處於統制之下，欲在短時期即能適應，誠屬十分困難。又加以工商業同業機構，向來習性，乃偏於同業感情之聯絡，業務和弊之硏討，今一且　以統轉同業會員，甚至各業會員之業務，均須受公會之約束，姑不論利弊如何，就其能否勝任而言，當非短時期內即能作遏高之期待。戰時物資統制事宜，經緯萬端，故商統會之職責至重，而商統會之基礎，自工商業企業單位以至同業公會及各地區聯合會，其傳統性能又如上述，且事屬草創，先進國之成例，或未必皆適合於我國，自難遽即期以盡善。</p>
<h3>軍需民生兼籌並顧</h3>
<p>最近政府修正各統制機構條例，將各項重要物資之採辦，配給，交換等實際統制工作，劃歸各統制委員會，商統會僅為承軸聯絡及對下層機構之監督指導機關，在軍務上似較過去減輕不少。但今後對於如何溝通政府與工商業者聞知意見，使國策遂行無杆路之虞，民情得一上達，軍需物資之提供，與民生之安定，得並行而不悖，此為全國朝野多責望於商統會，而商統會全體工作人員，亦將引為己責，殫心盡力，以貢獻國家於萬一者也。唯前述基本情鑿欲加以克服，則仍須相當時日之努力，蘭亭束髮受書，長而經商，拳拳服膺於先哲「藏富於民」之語，竊以為有子「百姓足，君孰與不足，百姓不足，君孰與足」之言，在平時固為至理，即戰時亦無例外。軍需物資之供應，與民生之關係，不僅不能相悖，而實為影之隨形，相需以成。近代戰爭所決定於物資者，至震且大，但必從廣義言之，始屬底理，故今後如何使生產增加，民生安定，庶軍需民需，物資俱得供應無　，實為要圖。至如何根據實際情况，擬定有效方案，如何使方案可以實施，商統會同人，智力有限，硃有賴於朝野俊彥，盟邦先進，竭誠相助，時加指導，始有尺寸之效可望一云。</p>

<p>米統會主席袁履登氏，近以養疴翳院，中央特准假三月，籍責休養，中央社記者昨（三）日特走訪袁氏於療養院承發表談話如下：</p>
<p>「履登養疴醫院瞬將匜月，閉門思過，蕭然物外，對於市商會上月二十六日本年度會員代表大會，未能力疾與會，僅以書面於開會詞中，略伸愚悃，幷希望早卸仔肩，免妨　路，乃照章改選理縱事時，腫登仍在　留之列，壯存理事虛名，已深悚惕，而本月一日全體理監事舉行就鑿典禮，並互選常務理監事，履登仍被選為常務理事，又承常務理事諸君，選履登為理事長，自顧行能無似，　承過愛，並覺汗顔，事關公益，無計懇辭，唯有一俟病體稍　，鑿竭駑　，以副展望而已。日前友人出示上月二十八日新聞報經濟社論「勗市商會」一文，擲誦論列，良言金石，攻錯他山，五中感佩，匪可言宣，除本屆會員大會通過之縱決案，自當切實次第執行外，至如何「加强機構增密會員團狀聯繫」，乃至對於富局之任何施策，以「民間經濟團體的姿態抱着事無不言言無不盡」的態度」云云，凡此縱言宏論，均足意佩，敢不拜嘉，　勉從事，以酬譽論之督責，與副我工商界　諉之盛意」。袁氏又云米統會職資，較為繁重，一時尙非病騙所能勝任，率最近已呈寨行政院令准給假三月，由陳副主任國權暫行代理主任委員職務，陳副主任老成練鐘，勤奮有為，必能克畫厥職，以副衆望。</p>

<h3>國民論壇　不合理情形</h3>
<p>— 黃節流</p>
<p>端節日我去黃縱，留四日返滬，沿途，睹許多不合理情形。我在黃渡搭上午八時三十分車來滬，是一次貨車，在站停有半小時之久，見一鄉人，負米約字麵粉袋。被站上一管路兵，用刺刀將其戳破，結果化去若干元無事。</p>
<p>並聞當地檢問所亦需開銷，後又來一黑帽者，囘一走單帮之女孩，進索二百五十元，聽說是走了多次。未曾開銷，呌他帶　十五斤，又未曾帶，其勢兇暴，非二百五十元不可，經多人婉勸，給一百二十元了結。後該車在麥根路停有半小時，又有愛路兵檢查，見有米即甩向事外，在黃站被兵戳破米袋之米包亦衹用出，經費去數十元携回，彼輩如狼似虎，鄕人固無可如何，即使是智識份子，如與理論，恐徒自取侮辱。</p>
<p>又如去北站購票，視路之遠近，亦得服票做外多付二三十元始得購票，警察又要錢，在裏邊黑指子見有可欺者即驅之向外，軋票又要錢，進月台又要錢，因為到處是排班，好不容易挨到排首如果無票買，勢必不能乘軍，經過警察亦然，如不付錢，便永遠站在排末，八時車不能乘，那末要十一時，再遲下午四時半，因彼輩利用此種心理，遂藉職務上之便利大施强凌弱手段，因此一進一出，物價不知高若干，讀白居易詩「是歲江南旱，衢州人食人」，鄙意似此賄賂公行，巧取豪奪，弱肉强食，即人食人，可慨也。</p>

<h3>櫻與錨（二）　海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>當時的感覺永不能忘却的隆夫，要求再一度參觀五十鈴號軍艦，正在興致大發時，眞人就來了一對信。</p>
<p>－－弟巳受命服務長　號……</p>
<p>眞人似乎在吳港乘艦，因為急待州發，所以沒有時間到東京去向隆失　辭，這　是一件可憎的事。</p>
<p>夫也　失掉一紫上明珠一樣。失望了，支年未見的莫逆－唯一知己的海軍七官一，這樣說離別就離別了，眞是一件令人難過的事。</p>
<p>但兩頁信紙外，還帶著一張文錄，運對於畫家，尤其對於海軍畫家的隆夫，充滿著鼓舞和激勵的字句。縱然到了吳港，凡自己所能者，無論什麼，總會給以絕大方便，所以不要客氣，請來，信中這樣寫着。此外還寫終左列明治天　的御作，請常常拜讀。字是用鋼筆寫的芷楷。</p>
<p>不論是否為軍，報國無二道。（質人的心，今昔未變……）隆夫感覺到成人的偵人，在友情方面仍與五年前相同，於是便頂認膜拜般地感激他。而隆夫對於偵人，也不自禁表示出如火如茶的熱烈友誼</p>
<p>（將要坐的軍艦，是什麼軍艦呢？）</p>
<p>眞人坐軍艦的事，就好像自己的事情一樣，願意曉得。</p>

<p>至於潛水母艦的任務，隆夫固然沒有精細的知識，但他總是知道，像母親給兒子奶吃一樣，潛水母艦是供給潛水艇食料和燃料的，是製潛水艇員休息的。隆夫非常的高興，認為這雖然不是浙水艇，但濾個潛水母艦也一定與偵人的本來願望相差不遠。</p>
<p>（偵人一步一步地開關未來的前途。那末我馬屬虎虎，也就不行了。）</p>
<p>劍與筆，固屬不同，但為海軍效力的這一點上，二者却是相同的。只要在海眾畫家方面專心硏究，則眞人這個海軍士官，永久就會在自己的心裏，想到此處，隆夫就感到無限的希望。</p>

<h3>Editorial: Rice Prices Cannot Withstand Stimulation</h3>
<p>From July 1st, the Rice Control Committee began implementing measures for actual grain requisition and licensing, and after three days, the black market rice price soared by 40-50%. This is a fact. Last time, after the Executive Yuan issued the "Provisional Measures for Grain Supply in Beijing and Shanghai" and the Rice Control Committee and the municipal government announced the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Civilian Grain in Shanghai," rice prices immediately soared. Subsequently, the municipal government announced a temporary suspension of implementation, and rice prices once slightly decreased and even stagnated. This is also a recent fact. Generally, it is believed that the implementation of requisition and licensing measures is enough to stimulate rice prices, and now this has indeed happened as expected. We believe that rice prices have reached such a serious stage that the only urgent need is to stabilize them and not to stimulate them further. The Rice Control Committee itself must know this, but to do so deliberately is truly perplexing.</p>
<p>Currently, the autumn harvest is approaching, and the inventory of old rice in the producing areas is low. The requisition is no longer appropriate. Requiring licenses for amounts under five "dou" (a unit of dry measure) is also superfluous. What does it prove? What if it doesn't prove anything? It should be understood that more procedures mean more trouble, and more opportunities for unscrupulous individuals to exploit. The "Three Hopes for Rice Policy" proposed by the economic editorial of the News Daily on July 2nd are very crucial: The requisition price should not be too low. If it is too low, rice merchants will not be willing to transport rice to Shanghai, except for the requisitioned portion, if they are not allowed to freely trade. The supply and demand of rice in Shanghai will inevitably become unbalanced. If free trade is allowed in addition to the requisition, the rice owners will inevitably seek compensation for the requisitioned portion from the freely traded portion, and rice prices in Shanghai will rise again. The staff of the Rice Control Committee's licensing office should be strictly managed to eliminate delays, obstacles, and extortion. The Municipal Advisory Council should send personnel to inspect and assist the authorities in supervision. The transport of rice under five "dou" should be strictly prohibited from being extorted by soldiers and police along the way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the rice price problem in Shanghai is like a patient suffering from stage two tuberculosis. The only hope for improvement is sufficient rest and nutrition, so that it gradually turns around from stability. If we ignore the facts and insist on unreasonable health theories, such as deep breathing, exercise, and cold water baths, and various other stimulants, it will inevitably lead to stage three tuberculosis and become seriously irreversible.</p>
<p>We urgently advocate that we only stabilize the current situation and not allow new stimuli. After the recent adjustment of the National General Chamber of Commerce, the Rice Control Committee is one of the five committees under the Chamber of Commerce implementing control work, subject to the guidance and supervision of the Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce should also be responsible for the measures of the Rice Control Committee. After the adjustment of the Chamber of Commerce this time, the new chairman, secretary-general, directors, and supervisors took office on July 2nd. In the past, they were all leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors who were extremely concerned about the people's food. We hope that they will pay attention to the serious reality of rice prices and quickly discuss reasonable solutions. We believe that the current Rice Control Committee should be reorganized as soon as possible to handle the winding-up work. At the same time, we should focus all our efforts on preparing for the grain control plan during the autumn harvest, that is, how to formulate a reasonable plan based on past failures when the new grain is harvested, whether it be requisition, pricing, or licensing. Everything must not be done behind closed doors, but must be carefully considered. It is particularly important to ask the Chamber of Commerce to select appropriate presiding personnel who have experience, credibility, prestige, and historical connections in the rice industry to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>North of Timor Sea: Enemy Submarine Sunk; Japanese Air Force Attacks U.S. Airfield on Biak Island</h3>
<p>Timor, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - A Japanese bomber unit discovered an enemy submarine surfacing north of Timor Island on the 1st and immediately attacked it. The submarine was hit and exploded, unable to submerge. The submarine sank itself, tilting to the left, but soon released a large amount of white foam, and then sank.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Melbourne, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced on the 1st that Japanese air force units had attacked the Ikmer Airfield on Biak Island, New Guinea, and U.S. military facilities on Owi Island.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Pacific Fleet Command announced that Japanese air force units bombed U.S. positions on Saipan Island again on the night of the 29th.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Base, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Enemy aircraft attacked the Northern Kuril Islands three times between the 1st and 2nd, but were repelled by the Japanese forces. The Japanese side suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in South China Launches Offensive; Advances Northward in Three Routes Along the Canton-Hankow Railway Line; Engages in Fierce Battles with the Seventh War Zone Army of Chongqing</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 3rd that Japanese units in South China, in response to the operations in Hunan, began attacking the Seventh War Zone Army of Chongqing on June 27th and are advancing northward along the Canton-Hankow Railway line.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, the Japanese army in Guangdong has begun to advance northward in an attempt to connect with the Japanese army advancing southward along the Canton-Hankow Railway line.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Chongqing's Central News Agency, the situation of the new operation of the Japanese army in South China is as follows: The Japanese army in Guangdong Province started attacking on June 17th in three routes to the north. On the morning of the 29th, they further strengthened their forces and advanced in six routes. Among them, four routes between Bao'an and Sanshui have forcibly crossed the north bank and are advancing towards the Chongqing army positions located about 14 kilometers southwest of Qingyuan (64 kilometers north of Guangzhou). A unit of the Japanese army has advanced towards the Chongqing army position about 9 kilometers east of Qingyuan. Another unit of the Japanese army is advancing north, directly pressing towards Longli. The Chongqing army is currently intercepting the Japanese, and fierce battles are underway. As of June 30th, the fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<h3>American Reporter Talks About the New Japanese Offensive</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from an Associated Press reporter in Chongqing on the 2nd, describing the situation of the new Japanese offensive as follows: Whether the scale of this operation can extend to all of China depends on the extent of the future development of the new Japanese offensive. The Sino-Japanese Incident will be eight years old, and the Chongqing authorities are also encountering a major threat unprecedented in the eight years of the incident. At the same time, this operation will have a significant impact on the current war, which is generally recognized. News circles further believe that this Japanese attack northward is a serious turning point in Chongqing's strategy, with the intention of securing Asia as a result.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Japanese army in Central China captured Changsha, they immediately advanced southward along the Canton-Hankow Railway, directly controlling Hengyang, a key point in the central section of the Canton-Hankow Railway. When Hengyang was about to fall, the Japanese army in South China suddenly launched an offensive on June 27th, responding to the Japanese army in Hunan, advancing northward along the Canton-Hankow Railway, penetrating the Beijiang River and its tributaries, which run through the northern region of Guangdong Province, and breaking through the Chongqing army's defense lines everywhere. The progress of the operation on that front is extremely smooth. Due to the progress of the Japanese army's operation in Hunan, Yu Hanmou, the commander of the Seventh War Zone, has recently felt shaken and urgently sought to reconfigure his forces. However, before the reconfiguration was completed, he encountered the attack of the northward-advancing Japanese army, resulting in chaos. At this point, the new military operations of the Japanese army, which are fighting separately on the Chinese front, have made the scale and concept even clearer. How the Japanese army will develop in the future is not something we can predict, but after the Japanese army in South China launched the northward operation, the Canton-Hankow Railway has become full of danger. If the Canton-Hankow Railway is opened by the Japanese army, the war situation centered on the Canton-Hankow Railway will be sufficient to clearly judge the future of the Greater East Asia War. Due to the progress of the operations in Hunan, the Japanese army can further open the Beijing-Hankow Railway, and the Japanese army in the Hunan operation is also planning to open the northern section of the Canton-Hankow Railway and control the Canton-Hankow Railway. If this plan is realized, the major Chinese artery line from Beijing to Guangdong will inevitably fall into the hands of the Japanese army. At this time, the impact on Chongqing's resistance will be significant. Therefore, whether Chongqing can shoulder the burden of fighting against the Japanese army is doubtful. Moreover, the opening of the Canton-Hankow Railway can further make the advanced bases of the stationed U.S. Air Force, such as Ji'an, Suichuan, and Ganzhou in Jiangxi Province east of the Canton-Hankow Railway, and Jian'ou in Fujian Province, and Lishui in Zhejiang Province, lose their function. Up to this point, the various inducement offensives launched by the Japanese China Expeditionary Force in China can be said to be a manifestation of answering the U.S.-Chiang talks with strength. At the same time, the continuous defeats of the Chongqing army are undoubtedly the defeats of the entire anti-Axis camp. From this perspective, the Japanese army's attack is sufficient to make the anti-Axis camp feel anxious.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Defeats Enemy Near Myitkyina</h3>
<p>Burma Front Line, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy near Myitkyina launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army's positions from midnight on the 28th, and repeatedly bombed with bombers until the 29th. After being intercepted by the Japanese army, the enemy abandoned many corpses and fled. In the battles in that area, as of June 30th, the enemy's 89th division suffered casualties of 1,784 men, including about 93 officers. At present, almost all the enemy forces in that area have been annihilated.</p>
<h3>Viceroy Wavell of India Refuses to Meet with Gandhi</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The fact that Indian Police Chief Wavell refused Gandhi's request for a meeting shows the development of British-Indian relations after Gandhi's release, so this matter has a great impact on the Indian political circles. The reason is that Gandhi's attitude towards Britain still adheres to the claims made in August 1942, and this claim is firm and unshakable in Gandhi's life. Knowing this, Britain has abandoned its past attitude of vigilance and decided on a fundamental policy towards Gandhi and the general anti-British movement. Now that Gandhi's fundamental attitude towards Britain has become increasingly clear, the future trend is extremely noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Acting Chairman Chen Visits Army Hospital</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Army Hospital of the Ministry of the Army has been open for several months, and its work has been actively developed. At 9:00 AM on the 3rd, Acting Chairman Chen of the Military Affairs Commission personally visited the hospital. The attendees included Chief of General Staff of the Military Affairs Commission Bao Wenyou, Minister of the Army Ye Gongchuo, Minister of the Navy Ren Yuandao, and Superintendent of the Capital Police Li Ao. Led by Guo Liancheng, the director of the hospital, and Zuo Qing, the deputy director, they inspected the various institutions and wards of the hospital, and gathered all the staff, medical officers, and nurses of the hospital to give a speech, urging all members to work hard. After listening respectfully, everyone was very excited. At 9:50 AM, Acting Chairman Chen left the hospital with everyone's respectful farewell.</p>
<h3>Economic Advisor Ogura Arrives in Tokyo Yesterday; Discusses Important Matters with Relevant Authorities</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, arrived here on the afternoon of the 3rd.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a telephone call from Fukuoka, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, arrived here from Seoul on the afternoon of the 3rd to report on the local economic situation and to discuss important matters with relevant authorities. Regarding the recent economic situation in China, he said that since taking office in mid-April, he has repeatedly held various candid talks with important figures in the National Government and powerful figures in the financial world, and has visited various places to inspect the economic situation. Although China's economic construction, such as price countermeasures, is a difficult problem, it has gradually made progress with the cooperation of Chinese financial figures. The victory in the Henan campaign this time has even deeper enthusiasm, which is deeply gratifying.</p>
<h3>U.S. Air Force Stationed in Chongqing Withdraws Forward Bases; Apparently Moving to Southwest of Guiyang</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Base, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Due to this operation, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has lost its important forward base, Hengyang Airfield. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly embarrassed due to the threat of the Japanese army to most bases in southwestern China. According to recent intelligence, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has not only abandoned the airfields in Hunan Province, but also has to abandon the forward bases in Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces. Airfields such as Lingling and Baoqing are almost deserted, and the use of bases such as Suichuan, Ganzhou, and Xincheng in Jiangxi Province is also restricted, and the number of enemy aircraft departing from that area is decreasing day by day. However, Guilin is still quite active, and the enemy's move to gather aircraft at the Liuzhou Airfield is also quite noteworthy. However, they are also preparing to evacuate recently, and because the Japanese army has increased the pressure from both air and land, the facilities of most bases are being moved to the highway towards Hozhou. Among them, a section of highway about 200 kilometers between Shaoguan and Babu is gathering people from nearby villages to work day and night to repair it. The enemy's embarrassing situation is becoming more and more obvious. It is speculated that the direction of the U.S. Air Force's retreat from Chongqing is Qingzhen, southwest of Guiyang. The enemy is working to organize the airfield there, intending to make it the most advanced base in South China. In short, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, with the goal of bombing the Japanese mainland, has been greatly affected by the progress of the war situation in southwestern China, and has finally been forced to move the first-line base to the mountains of Guiyang. However, the enemy's ambition has not died, and to shorten the distance of the attack on Japan, it is currently planning to move these bases to the Northwest region, which is also worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Occupies Hengyang Station</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - An Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing reported on the 2nd that the Japanese army has occupied Hengyang Station. From the point of view of the U.S. Air Force's attack on that station, it is known that the ground battle is taking place in the streets of Hengyang City.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - A Reuters correspondent in Chongqing published on the 2nd the war situation in Hengyang, saying that the Japanese army wanted to break into Hengyang City and launched a fierce attack in the past 48 hours, and threw hand grenades at the Chongqing army defending the Hengyang West Suburb Station and the public bus station. One route of the Japanese army strongly attacked the city from the east, and another route attempted to forcibly cross the river in the east of the Xiang River. Japanese aircraft bombed the military facilities of the Chongqing army who were desperately defending Hengyang. According to news in the city, the sound of Japanese artillery shells and bombs falling in the city was endless.</p>
<p>Ganzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - This operation in Hunan has given a great blow to the Chongqing anti-Japanese camp and the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing. On the 1st, the Associated Press in Chongqing stated that the purpose of the Japanese army's operation was to occupy strategic strongholds in South China as a preliminary battle for the attack, and to defend against Nimitz's offensive. The gist of it is that the Japanese army secured the land transportation from Manchuria to South China and advanced sharply southward along the Canton-Hankow Railway line. According to local well-informed sources, the Japanese army planned to occupy strongholds in South China in this operation to launch a preliminary offensive. If Hengyang falls, the Japanese army may directly attack the southwest. When the Japanese open the Canton-Hankow Railway line, their forces will inevitably spy on the isolated Fuzhou and Wenzhou areas. From this point of view, the Japanese army's operation is to defend against Nimitz's Pacific offensive through offense.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Needs Production Enters Second Phase; Strengthening Savings Measures Are Being Promoted</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - As the current war situation becomes increasingly severe, the Japanese military needs production industry will also pass the first phase of this year and begin to enter the second phase. Since the end of last year, a comprehensive production strategy has been implemented one after another with the goal of increasing the production of aircraft and warships, including production administration, production technology, production factors, and prices, and has achieved considerable results, and has completely solved various problems such as the capital equipment, labor transport capacity of occupational production. Up to now, the first phase of military needs production has achieved good results according to the established plan. Shipbuilding, which is the basis of transportation and military strength, is also proceeding smoothly. The increase in the production of light metals and the conversion to the principle of domestic production are also proceeding extremely smoothly. The rate of aircraft production, looking at the current strength of the war situation, only increasing the production of warships and aircraft is the key to breaking through the war situation. However, the so-called increase in production mainly lies in efforts in time and speed, and the success or failure of the second phase of production sedimentation will also be determined by this. Therefore, all Japanese people must make consistent efforts with a calm and composed attitude, trusting the leadership and the government, and devote themselves to production, so that life, production, and combat are linked together, firm in their beliefs, overcome difficulties, and sacrifice their own lives to fight for the war. This is the only way to survive. Last year, the Japanese people's savings organization exceeded the original target by 4 billion yen. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident began six and a half years ago, the increase in Japanese people's savings has actually exceeded 100 billion yen. The government has previously rewarded those who have contributed to savings in various places to commemorate this record. The savings target of 36 billion yen this year has now launched various promotion and strengthening measures in various regions and service locations throughout the country. To strengthen savings, there must be a careful plan and organization. The "Savings Strengthening Policy" decided on March 10th emphasizes this point and stipulates that the key points are directed towards departments whose income has increased significantly due to the situation and establishing a joint responsibility system for savings in service locations. To adapt to this policy, the Service Location Savings Cooperation Order was specially announced this time and will be implemented from July 1st, 7th year. It also considers that as the war strength increases, the number of workers and their income will also increase accordingly. Especially for port handling and land construction, absorbing the purchasing power of these emerging professionals who have inflated actual income of free laborers is the top priority from the perspective of maintaining economic order. Strengthening occupational savings and establishing a responsibility system is of great significance. Today, general public opinion has recognized that free laborers, small industrialists in the industry table, and commuting workers who live in rural areas in rural areas have the ability to save. Therefore, a new path has been opened for strengthening planned savings. As for Japan's evacuation countermeasures and emergency countermeasures for war disasters, the goal is to strengthen the domestic defense posture, and comprehensive progress is being made in funding, materials, labor, and transportation. The Japanese government has now recognized the special case in the Company Management Control Order for subsidies for the evacuation of families of company employees, temporary war damage supplies, and emergency expenditures of companies. Also, to utilize wartime special damage guarantees and wartime death and injury insurance, the Japanese province military needs has started to encourage and guide all employees of the factories under its jurisdiction to join war insurance. On the one hand, this can promote war spirit, and on the other hand, it can enable the enterprise management countermeasures in the event of air warfare to be implemented smoothly.</p>
<h3>Central Authorities Hold Weekly Meeting</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The National Government held a weekly meeting on the 3rd, with all members of the Civil and Military Attaches participating. The Civil Attache Xu chaired the meeting, performing the rituals as usual and reporting on the recent war situation.</p>

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister and German Envoy Hold Talks; Relations Between the Two Countries Become Closer; German Head of State and Japanese Ambassador Also Meet Frequently</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, in order to review the world war situation, met with German Ambassador to Japan Stahmer on the 28th of last month. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu also attended and participated. The two sides held candid talks and exchanged opinions without hindrance. According to the report, this meeting was the first of its kind, lasting approximately three hours. First, Prime Minister Tojo provided a detailed explanation of the current situation of the Greater East Asia War, and then Ambassador Stahmer frankly explained the European war situation and the current German military and political aspects. Japan and Germany will jointly share responsibility and counter the enemy's general counteroffensive under the Greater East Asia and European war situations in the future. Therefore, the meeting between Prime Minister Tojo and Ambassador Stahmer has great significance for jointly completing the war. In order to further tighten the cooperation between Japan and Germany, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima also meets with Head of State Hitler frequently. Therefore, Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu will also contact and discuss with German Ambassador Stahmer at any time in the future.</p>
<h3>Fierce German Counterattack; All-Day Battle in the Caen Area; Churchill-Type Tanks Appear on the Battlefield</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch, Haitong Agency) - The major tank battle southwest of Caen continued throughout yesterday, and the fierce situation has not diminished. The number of tanks and artillery is no less than that on the Eastern Front. Although the British army broke into the German line for several kilometers, the German army attacked along the Hindenburg Line and has reached Versonon, but the situation has not changed much in the past four hours. In the western area, German artillery is fiercely bombing the British tank base in Tortecal and the ammunition depot in Tille. Churchill-type tanks equipped with 23.4 caliber projectors have appeared on the southern flank of the British line, and the US military is using flamethrower rifles and hand grenades.</p>
<p>European Front, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Haitong Agency war correspondent Webb said: The tank battle southwest of Caen has been delayed for more than 100 hours, and has not diminished. The British Second Army loses an average of five tanks per hour, and the British tanks have lost 136 vehicles in the past 30 hours. Under the cover of the navy and army artillery, the British army is still trying to break through its main target on the right flank of the Barone, and seems to want to reach the Orne River south of Caen. The German army is also intensifying the pressure on the British tank teams. The "Hitler Youth Corps" tank division is slowly advancing under the resistance of the British army, and the counterattack yesterday has recovered three more important locations.</p>
<h3>British Forces Reach Sixteen Divisions</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch, Haitong Agency) - In recent days, hundreds of German artillery and mortars have concentrated their firepower to fiercely bombard the British Second Army gathered in a narrow area southwest of Caen. The enemy in the area has infantry and tanks, about ten divisions. Sometimes the artillery battle between the two sides reaches an unprecedentedly fierce level. The fact that the German army has used mortars shows that the German army has carried its heavy weapons to a place not far from the enemy's line. The war here is gradually evolving into a large-scale war of attrition. After the arrival of two infantry divisions and one tank division in the recent two days to provide reinforcements, the British Second Army is estimated to be between 14 and 16 divisions. The war in Sangro has also become tense, and the US army may soon start a major battle. The enemy's landing at the mouth of the Orne River has been stopped.</p>
<h3>Coastal Artillery Prevents Enemy Landing</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The German authorities announced on the 2nd: An enemy landing operation force composed of hundreds of ships of all sizes appeared on the sea near the mouth of the Orne River, and was prevented from landing due to the bombardment of German artillery.</p>

Then he held firm in the trenches at the northwest end of that peninsula until the last bullet.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Reuters West Front correspondent Steen reported today: German Lieutenant Colonel Keel, who fought to the end with his troops at The Hague Cape, has been captured along with his subordinates, but this statement has not been confirmed by other sources.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from London: The British army had suspended the recruitment of paratroopers since last autumn, but due to the invasion operation on the European continent, it has now decided to increase the number of personnel in the airborne force again.</p>
<h3>Northern Italy: German Troops Withdraw from Siena</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – A German news agency reports that official German sources state: Fierce fighting in Italy resumed yesterday. The enemy launched an offensive throughout the day between the coast and Lake Trasimeno. After fierce fighting, German troops disengaged and withdrew several kilometers to the north. Since the fighting has approached the southern part of Siena (in northern Italy), there is concern about damage to the historical and cultural monuments of this famous ancient city. Therefore, German troops have voluntarily withdrawn to the north of the city without being forced by the enemy. On the Adriatic coast, the enemy launched a strong attack, pushing German outposts back to the main defensive positions.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – A German news agency reports: The focus of the major defensive battles in Italy on Saturday was southwest and southeast of Siena. Tegor's troops, under the cover of American tanks, launched repeated attacks throughout the day, but were repelled.

<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – A German news agency reports, according to a German military communique: On the central sector of the Eastern Front, Soviet troops launched a strong attack on Slutsk, but were repelled after fierce fighting. In the Osipovichi area, German troops in the central Berezina region fought hard to break free. Soviet troops pressed hard in the area around Minsk, attacking Glubokoye with support from attack aircraft, but failed. In the intense defensive battles, artillery commander Martiniak, as well as Generals Pfeiffer and Sonnemann, all led from the front and died for their country.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – A German news agency reports: The major defensive battles on the central sector of the Eastern Front continued yesterday at various key points. In one area near Slutsk, German troops withdrew several kilometers west of the town to avoid street fighting. Near Borisov, several formations of Soviet tanks attempted to break through the German lines, but the result was only that the German main line of defense was moved back about six kilometers. Intense fighting also broke out in the Plock area, at which time the German defenders finally withdrew to the western and southern outskirts of the city, and then, under the cover of a large tank force, repulsed the Soviet attack.</p>

<p>Helsinki, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – A German news agency reports: The Finnish Prime Minister stated in a broadcast yesterday that the severance of diplomatic relations between Finland and the United States was not the fault of the Finnish people or the Finnish government. During the Winter War, both Britain and the United States recognized the right of the Finnish people to defend against aggression from the East, and even urged the Finnish people not to surrender. Finland is a democratic country and will never abandon its deeply rooted democratic order, and is determined to defend this order in the struggle forced upon it by the enemy. Finland will forever be the master of its territory. Although there are still many hardships ahead, Finland is aware of its responsibility for the future and will bravely face it.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Powers Intensify Pressure on Argentina; British Ambassador to US Returns Home</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – It is reported that after consultations between the British and American governments, they ordered their ambassadors to Argentina to return home. Following this, there is a trend to have all ambassadors to American countries return home. According to reports from Washington, the ambassadors of Mexico and Uruguay have been recalled to their countries. The Cuban ambassador, who had already returned home, has not returned to Buenos Aires. The charges d'affaires of Brazil, Nicaragua, and other countries who remained based on non-recognition of the regime will also be recalled home in the next few days. America's move to strengthen the pressure on Argentina by the anti-Axis camp.</p>

<h3>Wallace Departs Chongqing for US</h3>
<p>Macau, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – Havas agency reports: American newspapers report that US Vice President Wallace has concluded his visit to Chongqing and departed from Lanzhou yesterday to return to the United States.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army launched an offensive against Xue Yue's troops in the Ninth War Area of Hunan Province on May 27, it has been proceeding very smoothly, just like the previous operations in Henan. In just over twenty days after the start of the operation, on June 18, they completely occupied the key points of Changsha and Liling.</p>
<h3>Advancing on Multiple Routes</h3>
<p>Previously, the Japanese army advanced southward in three routes. The central route followed the Yuehan Railway, attacking the enemy's front directly. The right wing started from Huarong Anxiang, crossed Dongting Lake, and struck toward Xiangyin Yiyang. The left wing started from Chongyang Tongcheng, crossed the Wanyang Mountains, and attacked Liuyang. The three routes coordinated with each other, taking an encirclement posture against the enemy in the Changsha area. Xue Yue knew early on that he could not win, and repeatedly requested Chiang Kai-shek to send reinforcements. Although Chiang declared that Changsha must be defended to the death, he did not send reinforcements, focusing solely on the defense of Sichuan and the Xi'an area around Chongqing, leaving Xue Yue in a difficult situation. However, he still believed in the fighting strength of his troops, so he deployed 25 of his 28 divisions around Changsha, constructing an eight-shaped defensive line on the three lines of Yiyang, Changsha, and Liuyang, attempting to contain the Japanese army. However, after the Japanese army's fierce attack, Yiyang and Xiangyin on the right wing collapsed, and the west side of Changsha was cut off.</p>
<p>On the left wing, Liuyang fell on the 15th. At the same time, Zhuzhou on the Yuehan Railway south of Changsha also fell into the hands of the Japanese army. Changsha was completely surrounded, and its fate became a matter of time. However, the troops defending around Changsha were the Fourth Army, known as the most elite in Xue Yue's army. It had contributed to the first and second battles of Changsha. Its commander, Zhang Deneng, was determined to defend Changsha to the death. At the same time, the city of Changsha and the Yue Lu Mountain on its western outskirts, as well as the Taohua Mountain to the west, were filled with bunkers and fortifications, becoming a fortress. The Japanese army had to be cautious about this. Finally, on the morning of the 18th, they launched a fierce attack. The enemy, with their morale demoralized, only held out for one day, and Changsha fell. Fifteen enemy divisions were defeated.</p>
<h3>The Course of the Japanese Army's Third Capture of Changsha</h3>
<p>The American air force stationed in Chongqing had intended to be quite active from the beginning, but after the Japanese air force launched a pre-emptive strike and dealt them a heavy blow, the enemy air force could no longer conduct active operations, and could only launch guerrilla-style air raids from bases in the interior.</p>
<h3>Three Times Lost and Regained</h3>
<p>Changsha and Changde on the shores of Dongting Lake are both vital centers of Hunan Province. Changsha, in particular, is the capital of Hunan Province, where the headquarters of the Ninth War Area of the Chongqing side are located. Changsha had been subjected to lightning-like attacks by the Japanese army twice, in September and December of the 30th year of the Republic (1941). This is the third time it has fallen.</p>
<p>Since the fall of Wuhan in October of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), Chongqing has designated most of Hunan Province as the Ninth War Area, equipped with 400,000 troops. At the same time, they loudly proclaimed "decisive battle in Hunan", and specially built strong positions within a hundred-kilometer range on the banks of the Xinqiang River and the Miluo River in the southeastern part of Dongting Lake. A year and a half later, the Japanese army began to attack the rebuilt anti-Japanese base, the Ninth War Area. This was the first battle of Changsha. On September 18 of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), the Japanese army unexpectedly launched an operation from the Xinqiang River southeast of Yuezhou for the third time. In the blink of an eye, they broke through the Miluo River defense line. On the tenth day of the operation, they quickly captured Changsha. On October 1, the Japanese army announced that they had restored the original situation and withdrew from Changsha.</p>
<p>In December of the same year, before the enemy could catch their breath, the second battle of Changsha broke out. The Japanese army defeated 100,000 enemy troops and pressed directly on Changsha. On the eighth day of the operation, January 1 of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), they occupied Changsha again. In the meantime, because enemy troops from the Fifth and Sixth War Areas, about twenty divisions, launched an attack on the rear of the Japanese army fighting in Changsha, the Japanese army declared that the purpose of the second battle of Changsha had been achieved and allowed the situation to return to its original state.</p>
<p>After that, the Ninth War Area was reorganized again, and since the end of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), they have actively operated under the slogan "Winter Offensive". Last February, the Japanese army launched a spring operation against the Ninth and Sixth War Areas, and in May, they conducted a summer operation in the northern part of Dongting Lake. Furthermore, in November, they launched the Battle of Changde, occupying Changde in just over three weeks. However, since the operations in Hunan, the fall of Changsha this time has had the most profound impact on Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Scenery and Products</h3>
<p>Changsha is located on the right bank of the Xiang River, with a population of 300,000. Its main products are rice, tea, paper, tobacco, lacquer, hemp, kapok, tung oil, porcelain, timber, coal, iron, and antimony, and industry is relatively developed. The prefectural city is rectangular, about two miles from north to south and one mile from east to west, with a circumference of about six miles and a height of three zhang. It is built of stone and brick and is extremely strong, earning the local people's name of "Iron Wall City".</p>
<p>Changsha is not only a military stronghold since ancient times, but also a famous place for lecturing. In the past, men of letters and poets who came to view the natural scenery of the Xiang River and Dongting Lake visited this place in droves, so there are many literary relics. The most famous scenic spot in Changsha is Yuelu Mountain on the opposite bank of the Xiang River. In the mountain there are Zibei Pavilion, Aiwan Pavilion, Wanshou Temple, Baihe Spring, Yuwang Stele, Zhuzi Pavilion, Yunlu Palace, Wangxiang Pavilion, etc. Modern revolutionary martyrs Huang Xing and Cai E are also buried in this mountain. The Yuelu Academy at the foot of the mountain was one of the four great academies of the world of Zhu Xi in the past and is now a normal school.

<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – The Philippine Ambassador to Japan, Vargas, previously took a month's leave to return home for recuperation. His term has now expired and he returned to his post on the 2nd. He met with reporters at the Philippine Embassy here this afternoon and made the following statement: The organization of the Philippine government has gradually been completed since the reorganization of the Public Service Corps into a political group. Among them, the local administrative organization was not sound before the war, but it has now been completed through the efforts of the government and local government offices, which is truly gratifying. During my return home, I repeatedly held talks with President Laurel. The government has a concrete plan for dealing with the current situation, so the Philippines will take the most necessary measures at the most appropriate time. After returning to my post, I am determined to work sincerely in accordance with this policy and in accordance with the fundamental spirit of the Japan-Philippines Alliance to strengthen Japan-Philippines relations.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Disperses Chongqing Military Prisoners of War</h3>
<p>Hankou, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, considering that the Chongqing military troops who were captured in various places by the Allied nations and transported to Hankou were mostly weak and seriously ill after a long journey, and that their situation was extremely pitiful, obtained the consent of the relevant parties, together with the Red Swastika Society, to allow them to be dispersed and returned to their hometowns. The Bureau and the Red Swastika Society also provided travel expenses at their discretion. For those who were far from the province, the Bureau and the Red Swastika Society provided 500 national currency yuan. Those who were near were each given 300 yuan. Yesterday, 74 people were issued payments.</p>
<h3>Hu Wenhu Founds the "Gongzheng Bao"</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – Hu Wenhu, a prominent overseas Chinese businessman from Southeast Asia, has founded a small newspaper called "Gongzheng Bao," scheduled to be published on the 4th. Hu Shan, the president of the Hong Kong Daily News, will serve as the president, and Mr. Jia Nafu will serve as the editor-in-chief. Under the guidance of the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Japanese military authorities, the newspaper will promote the construction of China and cooperation in the war against Britain and the United States, and have a character suitable for the needs of the masses. It is also learned that after the publication of the newspaper, Mr. Hu plans to invest 50 million yuan to establish the China Overseas Chinese Farmers Bank in Guangzhou to help farmers along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and develop the minerals in the area. It is currently under active preparation.</p>
<h3>Special Insurance Committee Increases Subsidies</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – Since its establishment, the Special Insurance Committee for Central Government Employees of the Ministry of Social Welfare has been meeting the needs and temporarily does not charge insurance premiums, so the number of applications for registration and payment has been increasing. In view of the endless increase in prices and the increasingly difficult lives of civil servants, in order to further reduce the unexpected burdens on civil servants, Minister Ding of the Ministry was specially approved to make appropriate revisions to the original payment method starting from July of this year. For those who apply for funeral expenses and disability allowance payments hereafter, the amount of payment will be appropriately increased to live up to the government's intention to confer benefits.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Orders Subordinates to Facilitate Grain Transportation</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – In order to maintain the food supply for the people of Zhejiang, the Provincial Government has allowed rice merchants to freely purchase and transport within designated procurement areas in accordance with the Temporary Measures for People's Food, in order to ensure sufficient supply. However, it has been repeatedly reported that military, political, police, tax, and customs checkpoints often make difficulties on the pretext of obstructing the transport of rice and grain across the border, or even illegally extort money, which is a disregard for people's food and a violation of laws and regulations. In addition to thoroughly investigating and severely punishing such actions, a general order was issued to all subordinate agencies yesterday, stating that from now on, they should facilitate the passage of rice and grain across the border and absolutely not allow the above-mentioned situations to occur. In particular, rice and grain with passports from the Rice Control Association must be protected along the way. If there are any violations, they will be severely punished upon investigation and will not be tolerated.</p>

<h3>Interview with Chairman of the Commercial Control Association on Improving Material Control: Military Supply Cannot Contradict People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen material control, the Executive Yuan of the National Government reorganized the National Commercial Control Association and specially appointed Wen Yiting as the chairman. He took office at the association on the first day of this month. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Wen, who made the following statement on the future direction of improving material control:</p>
<p>"I originally dared not accept the order to head the Commercial Control Association because of my age and declining strength, but since I have received sincere encouragement from the government and Allied authorities, I also feel that I cannot shirk my responsibility. Now that the Commercial Control Association is undergoing reorganization, looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, various parties have high expectations. We should do our best within our capabilities and the constraints of the environment.</p>
<h3>Material Control Not Easily Effective</h3>
<p>However, there are still some things that I must tell everyone. The Commercial Control Association has the purpose of assisting the government in implementing national policies. Its business is to handle material control matters by order of the government, and its responsibility is particularly heavy. However, the Commercial Control Association itself is a commercial collective autonomous organization. To carry out material control work, it is extremely difficult to achieve results without the full assistance of all parties. For decades, the economic life of our people has been based on nature. It is extremely difficult to adapt to control in a short period of time. In addition, the traditional habits of industrial and commercial trade organizations tend to focus on the connection of trade feelings and the discussion of business advantages and disadvantages. Now, once they are subject to the control of industry members, and even the business of members of each industry must be subject to the constraints of the guild, regardless of the advantages and disadvantages, it is certainly not possible to make a high expectation of success in a short period of time. There are ten thousand strands in wartime material control matters, so the responsibilities of the Commercial Control Association are extremely heavy, and the foundation of the Commercial Control Association, from industrial and commercial business units to trade associations and local federations, has the traditional functions mentioned above, and the matter is still in its initial stage. The precedents of advanced countries may not all be suitable for our country, so it is difficult to expect perfection immediately.</p>
<h3>Military and People's Needs to be Considered Together</h3>
<p>Recently, the government revised the regulations of various control agencies, assigning the actual control work of procurement, distribution, and exchange of various important materials to various control committees. The Commercial Control Association is only the liaison and supervisory guidance agency for the lower-level agencies, which seems to be much lighter than in the past in terms of military affairs. However, in the future, how to communicate the opinions between the government and industrial and commercial operators, so that the implementation of national policies will not be obstructed, the people's feelings will be conveyed upwards, and the supply of military materials and the stability of people's livelihood can be carried out without contradiction. This is what the whole country expects from the Commercial Control Association, and all the staff of the Commercial Control Association will also take it as their responsibility and do their best to contribute to the country. However, if the aforementioned basic conditions are to be overcome, it will still take considerable time and effort. From the time when I bound my hair and received books to growing up and doing business, I have always adhered to the words of the sages that "wealth should be stored among the people." I believe that Zisi's words "If the people are sufficient, who is insufficient for the ruler? If the people are insufficient, who is sufficient for the ruler?" are true even in wartime. The supply of military materials and the people's livelihood are not only not contradictory, but are in fact like the shadow following the form, needing each other to achieve success. Modern warfare is determined by materials, which is extremely important, but this must be said in a broad sense. Therefore, in the future, how to increase production and stabilize people's livelihood, so that both military and civilian needs and materials can be supplied without worry, is the key plan. As for how to formulate effective plans based on the actual situation, and how to make the plans feasible, the colleagues of the Commercial Control Association have limited intelligence and rely on the sincere assistance and timely guidance of the elites of the court and the public and the advanced countries of the alliance to make some progress.</p>
<h3>Conversation with Chairman of the Rice Control Association, Yuan Ludeng: He Has Been Granted a Three-Month Leave by the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, has repeatedly requested resignation due to illness. He has now been granted a two-month leave by the Executive Yuan on June 28, Yanzhi No. 6056, for recuperation. All duties will be temporarily performed by Chen Guozhao, the Vice Chairman of the Committee. Mr. Chen has high moral character and prestige, and his advice will be quickly communicated. He will be able to fulfill his duties to the utmost in regard to the food problem of this city.</p>
<p>President of the Rice Control Association, Yuan Ludeng, has recently been recovering from illness in the hospital. The Central Government has specially approved a three-month leave for recuperation. A Central News Agency reporter paid a special visit to Mr. Yuan at the sanatorium yesterday (3rd) and was granted the following interview:</p>
<p>"Ludeng has been in the hospital for almost a month, thinking about the past behind closed doors, detached from the world. I regret that I was unable to attend the annual meeting of members' representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 26th of last month, due to my illness. I could only express my humble thoughts in writing in the opening speech, and hope to unload the burden of my responsibilities early, so as not to hinder the road. When the directors and supervisors were re-elected in accordance with the regulations, Chongdeng was still among those who were retained, and I still held the nominal title of director, which made me feel deeply ashamed. On the 1st of this month, the directors and supervisors held an inauguration ceremony and mutually elected standing directors and supervisors. Ludeng was still elected as a standing director, and I was again elected by the standing directors as the chairman. I feel that my actions are not similar, and I have received excessive love and felt ashamed. As it concerns public welfare, there is no way to decline. I can only wait until my health recovers slightly and exert my dull ability to live up to the expectations. The other day, a friend showed me the editorial "Encouraging the Municipal Chamber of Commerce" in the Economic News of the News on the 28th of last month. Reading the discussion, the good words are golden and stone, and attacking mistakes is like looking at other mountains. My feelings are beyond words. In addition to the implementation of the longitudinal resolutions passed by the Members' Congress of this session, how to "strengthen the organization to increase the density of membership group connections," and even any measures for the Bureau of Wealth, "holding the attitude of a non-governmental economic group, saying everything without reservation," and all these longitudinal words and grand theories are worthy of admiration. How can I not salute and encourage myself to engage in the matter, in order to reward the supervision of the critics and to live up to the great intentions of our industrial and commercial circles?" Mr. Yuan also said that the duties of the Rice Control Association are relatively heavy, and he cannot immediately overcome his illness and be competent. Therefore, he has recently submitted a report to the Executive Yuan to approve a three-month leave, and Chen, the deputy director, will temporarily act as the chairman. Deputy Director Chen is experienced, diligent, and promising, and he will certainly be able to fulfill his duties and live up to the expectations of the public.</p>
<h3>Foreign Staff of the First District Office to Finish Up</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the administrative organization and refer to the municipal administration system of the Central Executive Committee, the First District Office of this city has completely changed all official documents to the Chinese format. At the same time, appropriate adjustments have been made to the administrative organization, so foreign staff are being reduced and the concession system is being eliminated. All foreign staff have now voluntarily submitted their resignations, which have been approved by Director Wu one by one. Severance pay, etc., has been issued generously. The foreign staff have begun to complete the closing procedures and transfer matters, and will retire at the end of this month. However, the municipal problems of this city are complicated, and it is not easy to recruit technical personnel. Therefore, with the consent of Director Wu, a part of the important Japanese technical personnel, about thirty people, will continue to be hired to assist in the construction of the city.</p>
<h3>The Administrative Improvements of the City Procuratorate in One Month: Report by Chief Prosecutor Zhao</h3>
<p>Zhao Zhengtao, Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate, held an important press conference at ten o'clock yesterday morning in the North Building of the Office, reporting on the progress of rectification in the past month.</p>
<h3>Following the Ministry's Order to Strictly Enforce Bail</h3>
<p>Chief Prosecutor Zhao said in his speech, "Regarding the strict enforcement of bail, the Ministry of Justice has already issued an order for compliance. I have checked that there are as many as 1,670 prisoners in the detention center of this office, which has caused the overcrowding of prison rooms. In this hot summer, prisoners in prisons are prone to disease and death, so it is imperative to strictly enforce bail. Therefore, we have specifically considered the circumstances of the case and the severity of the crime, and have implemented it since the first day of this month. For all cases of theft, homicide, official malfeasance, drugs, rape, burglary, extortion, arson, flooding, and economic crimes, cases with a future minimum principal sentence of imprisonment of five years or more, the principle is detention. For other cases, the principle is strict enforcement of bail. In exceptional circumstances, the nuclear processing may be considered at any time.</p>
<h3>Avoid Delays in Cases and Handle Them in Court</h3>
<p>In the past, all inspectors of this office had to first sign and submit a report to the chief prosecutor for approval before considering cases. The intention was originally to prevent each inspector from exceeding their authority, but in fact it was enough to delay the progress of the case. Therefore, it has been decided to abolish this. From now on, the handling inspector will consider the circumstances of the case in court for all dispositions such as bail, commitment, and return. The inspector will first handle the disposition, but should also submit the case file for review afterwards, so that the progress of the case will not be delayed and the people will be spared the burden of litigation.</p>
<h3>Improve Bail and Commitment Procedures</h3>
<p>The bail liability procedures will also be improved in order to eliminate corruption and difficulties. In the future, for all defendants who should be granted bail, the handling prosecutor should hand over the form to the legal police team business section in court, and another dispatching police officer will complete the process within two hours. The commitment time should also be noted, and the handling personnel should also supervise at any time to see whether there is any time limit and whether there is any need to solicit difficulties. If the bail form has passed the office hours and cannot be purchased, then it should be allowed to first issue a promise and replenish the bail form the next day.</p>
<h3>Sentencing for Minor Offenses by Decree</h3>
<p>According to Article 61 of the Criminal Law, in order to expedite case resolution, it is requested that sentencing be carried out by decree. To this end, instructions have been given to the relevant prosecuting attorneys to diligently request such sentencing for all minor cases. Sentencing by decree not only reduces travel for litigants but also saves considerable manpower and resources. Furthermore, autopsy reports will be included in the case file for review. Confiscated赃物 from the provincial government were ordered to be partially cleared.  The auction proceeds totaled 640,000 yuan, which have been submitted to the Administrative Department of the Judicial Division.  In addition, the position of Chief Prosecutor of the Local Procuratorate has remained vacant. The Chief Prosecutor believes that the position is of great importance and cannot be left unfilled for long.  An order has been received from the ministry appointing Sun Jiaquan to the position.  Mr. Sun arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and formally assumed his duties.</p>
<p>The municipal government has appointed Tan Tiankai to reside in the District Education Bureau's First District Inspectorate, handling educational administrative matters within the First District. Yesterday, in the meeting room of the police headquarters, a tea party was held to entertain all the committee members of the Municipal Administration Committee's Education Group. Yan Huiqing, Zhu Boquan, Shen Siliang, Pei Fuzhi, Zhao Jinxing, Lin Zhaohou, Chen Riping, and Zhao Zhengzheng were all in attendance. At the meeting, Councilor Tan provided a detailed explanation of the district's educational administration, and the committee members offered their opinions.</p>
<h3>### Counterfeit Rationed Goods Under Investigation by Authorities</h3>
<p>The soap and matches rationed in Shanghai are of relatively good quality. As a result, some designated retailers have been selling rationed goods bearing designated brands or printed with the words "government ration" on the black market, replacing them with inferior counterfeits for distribution. Unsuspecting citizens are easily deceived. The First District of the Nanshi area is a major base of operations for these individuals. They disregard the public interest to an extreme degree. It has been learned that the authorities are currently investigating and will severely punish those found guilty according to law to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>### Local Authorities Organize Grain Patrol Teams, Dispatching Them to Various Locations for Inspection</h3>
<p>Concerned about the people's food supply, the municipal government has instructed the Special Operations Brigade of the Security Corps to organize grain transport patrol teams. Led by Deputy Commander Zhang Duo, the security teams will patrol the North Railway Station, the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, Longhua Town, Zhoujiaqiao, Changan Road, Hongqiao Town, and other locations. Any unscrupulous individuals encountered along the way who obstruct, extort, or rob rice merchants will be severely punished. If rice merchants encounter any of the above situations en route, they should report it to the nearest patrol team or call 21083 or 20136. The Special Operations Brigade Headquarters is located at 57A Changan Road. Patrol hours are from 5:00 AM to 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Association Handles Transfer Applications</h3>
<p>The National General Chamber of Commerce is being reorganized. The essential commodities departments, including flour and wheat, oil and grain, and cotton, are being converted into regulatory committees under the Executive Yuan. The Chamber of Commerce will play a supervisory and guiding role. The transfer of commodities under the purview of these regulatory committees will be handled by the committees themselves. The Chamber of Commerce will no longer be involved. The organizational regulations for the Flour and Wheat Regulatory Committee have been approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan. The committee will establish a department to handle the restriction of flour and wheat transfers. All pending flour and wheat application matters from the former Chamber of Commerce's Commodity Transfer Application Permit Office have been closed and are being transferred to the Flour and Wheat Regulatory Committee.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Increases Telegraphic Transfer and Telegram Fees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank handles remittance services with low exchange rates. The remittance fee for bank drafts from Shanghai to Guangzhou is five yuan per thousand, four yuan for Shantou and Xiamen, three yuan for Hankou, Jiujiang, Nanchang, and Wuchang, two yuan for Anqing, one yuan and fifty cents for Ningbo, Yangzhou, Taixian, Nantong, Shaoxing, Yuyao, Zhenhai, and Huaiyin, one yuan for Nanjing, Bengbu, Wuhu, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changshu, Changzhou, Hangzhou, Xuzhou, Suxian, Lianyungang, and Haizhou, and fifty cents for Suzhou, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Taicang, Kunshan, and Xiashi. Telegraphic transfers are subject to additional telegraph fees. The original telegraph fee for transfers to Guangzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen in South China was 160 yuan per transaction, and 100 yuan for all other locations. Since July 1st, the telegraph fee for telegraphic transfers has been increased to 200 yuan per transaction. The previously reported adjustment to telegraphic transfer fees was actually an error regarding the telegraph fee.</p>
<h3>Financial Institutions' Mid-Year Settlements Completed; Resume Business After Holiday</h3>
<p>Shanghai's financial institutions have safely completed their mid-year business settlements. As usual, they took a two-day holiday on July 1st and 2nd. However, because the 2nd fell on a Sunday, they took a compensatory holiday yesterday (the 3rd). Today (the 4th), all financial institutions and markets have resumed normal operations. The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has moved from 15 The Bund to its new address at 23 The Bund. Today (the 4th), it will begin operating at its new location and continue its business.</p>
<h3>Readers' Educational Assistance Donations; Student Applications Currently Being Registered</h3>

Not only are the thousands of impoverished students infinitely grateful, but the staff of this office is also greatly encouraged! As for the work itself, it has been proceeding in accordance with the planned steps. For example, more than 10,000 application forms have been sent by more than 700 large, medium, and small schools as scheduled. These forms are currently being registered separately. The full cooperation of the principals of the various schools has enabled the initial review to proceed smoothly, which is very commendable.</p>
<p>Screening Examination Dates: The dates for the screening examinations for applicant students have not yet been decided but will be around late July. Students of all levels in primary and secondary schools must participate in the examinations at that time. Those who must return home for the summer vacation must also arrive temporarily. There are no exceptions. As for university students, the examination will not be offered due to the different subjects studied. (First-year students must take the examination). Instead, emphasis will be placed on investigation interviews or discussions, which will take place around mid-August. Therefore, there should be no problem for those who wish to return home. However, readers should also pay attention to the news in this column at any time.</p>

<h3>China Cloth Industry Bank Ordered to Resume Business</h3>
<p>The China Cloth Industry Bank at 289 Da Shanghai Road, which had temporarily suspended operations, has resumed payments as usual. Since Chairman Gu Nanqun was concurrently appointed as General Manager, in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's orders, the bank has been actively streamlining its internal departments, improving accounting procedures, and striving for renewal. The morale has been greatly boosted. It has also safeguarded the rights of depositors and maintained the reputation of the industry. Even during the peak period of tight money at the mid-year settlement, the bank handled it with ease, as usual. Its spirit of service is commendable. After submitting a report on the implementation to the Financial Affairs Inspection Office and forwarding it to the Ministry of Finance, the bank received instructions from the Ministry of Finance stating that it should report the date of resumption of business. Since the bank's receipt of the order coincided with the mid-year settlement holiday, it was decided to resume business on July 4th, together with the branches in Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and Changzhou. The bank is financially strong, and with this renewal, its reputation will be further enhanced, and its business will surely prosper in the future.</p>
<p>The piers along the river within the jurisdiction of the First District of this city were previously ordered by the municipal government to be uniformly managed by the Public Utilities Bureau. The situation at these piers is extremely complex. The bureau has established a pier management office to specialize in management. It is learned that the office is working to improve the order of the piers. For example, scalpers who harm travelers are being cracked down on at any time. The dock workers are also being supervised in coordination with the Shanghai Dock Services Department of the Social Welfare Department. The construction of the piers is also being actively planned. The order of the piers is now more advanced than before.</p>

<h3>National Forum Unreasonable Circumstances</h3>
<p>— Huang Jieliu</p>
<p>I went to Huangzhong on Dragon Boat Festival and returned to Shanghai after staying for four days. Along the way, I witnessed many unreasonable situations. I took the 8:30 am train to Shanghai at Huangdu. It was a freight train, and it stopped at the station for half an hour. I saw a villager carrying rice in a flour sack. A traffic controller at the station used a bayonet to puncture it, resulting in the loss of some yuan for nothing.</p>
<p>I also heard that the local inspection station also needs expenses. Later, a black-hatted man came and returned a single-carrying girl, demanding 250 yuan. I heard that she had gone many times. I had never paid any expenses, and told her to bring ( ) 15 catties, but she didn’t bring it, and his momentum was fierce, and 250 yuan was a must. After many persuasion, he gave 120 yuan to settle it. Later, the car stopped on Macgen Road for half an hour, and the Ailu soldiers checked again. Seeing that there was rice, they threw it outside. The rice bag that had been punctured by soldiers at Huang Station was also only used, and it cost dozens of yuan to carry it back. These people are like wolves and tigers, and the villagers have no choice. Even if they are intellectuals, if they reason with them, I am afraid they will only insult themselves.</p>
<p>For example, if you go to the North Station to buy a ticket, you have to pay an extra 20 or 30 yuan for the ticket depending on how far the road is, and then you can buy a ticket. The police also want money, and the black fingers inside see someone who can be bullied and drive them out, and then they want money for the ticket, and they want money to enter the platform, because there are queues everywhere, and it is not easy to get to the front of the line. If you don’t have a ticket to buy, you will not be able to take the military. If you go through the police, you will also have to pay, otherwise, you will always stand at the end of the line. If you can’t take the 8 o’clock train, then you will have to take the 11 o’clock, and then the 4:30 pm one, because they use this kind of psychology to take advantage of the convenience of their position to exert their power and bully the weak. Therefore, with every in and out, the price is much higher. I read Bai Juyi’s poem "In this year, there was a drought in Jiangnan, and people in Quzhou ate people." I think that this kind of bribery is rampant, taking by force, and the strong eating the weak is like people eating people, which is sad.</p>
<h3>Social Services Symptoms of Typhoid Fever</h3>

<h3>Cherry Blossoms and Anchors (2) - The Navy</h3>
<p>— By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Takao, unable to forget the feeling he had at the time, requested another visit to the cruiser Isuzu. Just as his enthusiasm was reaching its peak, a letter arrived from Masato.</p>
<p>––Your brother has been ordered to serve on the [blank] [ship number]…</p>
<p>Masato seemed to be boarding the ship in Kure Naval Base. Because his departure was urgent, he didn't have time to go to Tokyo to say goodbye to Takao, which was regrettable.</p>
<p>Takao felt as if he had lost a bright pearl. He was disappointed that his close friend whom he hadn't seen for years—his only confidant, a naval officer—was leaving with such a hurried farewell. It was truly saddening.</p>
<p>However, along with the two pages of the letter, there was also a transcript filled with encouraging and inspiring words for the artist, especially for Takao, the naval artist. Even though he was in Kure Naval Base, he would provide every possible convenience that he could, so he shouldn't hesitate to come. The letter stated this. In addition, it included a copy of a poem by Emperor Meiji, asking him to read it often. The writing was in the regular script, written with a fountain pen.</p>
<p>Whether military or civilian, there is only one way to serve the country. (Masato's heart remains unchanged from the past…) Takao felt that Masato's sincerity was the same as it was five years ago in terms of friendship, so he was grateful to him with a reverent admiration. And Takao couldn't help but express his fervent friendship like a blazing fire towards Masato.</p>
<p>(What warship will Masato be on?)</p>
<p>The matter of Masato boarding a warship felt like his own, and he wanted to know.</p>
<p>He hurriedly took out the album of warship photographs. Looking at it, he saw that although it wasn't exactly a new warship, its majestic and imposing form was enough to satisfy him. Reading the explanatory text, he saw it was a submarine tender, and suddenly became happy.</p>
<p>(Masato is getting closer to his aspirations…)</p>
<p>Although Takao didn't have detailed knowledge of the duties of a submarine tender, he knew that, like a mother giving milk to her son, a submarine tender provided food and fuel to submarines and was a place for submarine crews to rest. Takao was very pleased, thinking that although it wasn't a submarine, a submarine tender must not be far from Masato's original wishes.</p>
<p>(Masato is gradually opening up his future. Then I, a mere painter, cannot lag behind.)</p>
<p>Sword and pen are certainly different, but in terms of serving the navy, the two are the same. As long as he concentrated on his studies as a naval artist, Masato, the naval officer, would forever be in his heart. Thinking of this, Takao felt endless hope.</p>
<p>(Masato is always my lifelong confidant…) (End)</p>
