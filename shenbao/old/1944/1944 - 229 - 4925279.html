<h3>培養工商實用人材的意義</h3>
<p>— 唐壽民</p>
<p>自來國運之隆替，事業之成敗，莫不繫乎人材之消長，故得人則興，失人則廢，已成爲千古不移之名言。政治方面，前例甚多，無待枚舉。即以社會事業而言，就鄙人涉足商塲數十年經騐所得，凡一專業能得人者，無論其創始如何艱難？資本如何薄弱？設備如何簡陋？規模如何狹隘？非但成功可期，並可發揚光大，亦終等於曇花一現。執此一繩，百試不爽。故親友中有以創辦事業來相諮詢者，必首以「得人」二字爲貢獻。</p>
<p>得人方法，就一個機關而言，不外懸擬標準，虛心訪求。但爲整個社會言，則必就所需要，加以培養，然後始能人材輩出，供應不匱。多年來，社會上恒發生一種極端對立的現象，一方面是任何事業都感覺不能物色到適當人材，完成了一個健全的幹部。可是，另一方面，社會上失業的人數，逐年一批一批的增加。因此常可以聽到「畢業即失業」的口號，這不能不歸咎於敎育機關與事業機關缺少聯繫，同時青年學子在升這的時候，也欠缺縝密的考慮和到適當的指導。</p>
<p>吾國各種事業之不能發達，斷斷不僅是單純資本問題，還有人材問題，尤其是實用人材的缺乏，影響到任何事業都不能做到合理化的地步。實用的人材，並不需要何種高深學理，而是對他所辦理的工作，能澈底的明瞭領會，能貫澈的做去。並且每個事業，性質不同，實用人材就必須配合每一種需要而個別訓練，吾國最高深夜交通大學的管理科，就本此意義而成立。所以管理科的畢業生分發制到各鐵路以後，在本人則可以有相當的建樹，在路政則可以得到改進的效果，這就是培養實用人材，足以協助事業發展最好的一個前例。</p>
<p>工商金融是中國經濟建設的中堅，但是要想工商金融發達，就應該首先注意到工商金融內部實用人植物充實。年來屢以此事與工商金融界領袖交換意見，咸有同感。並且現在已經由理想而成爲事實。此次工商金融界發起創辦的中華商業專科學校，就是本此宗旨而成立。我們創辦這個學校的最大目的，在造成職業青年，一糾過去畢業即失業的現象。同時，更希望能藉此提高一般產業界的工作效能，减少國民經濟上的無謂損失。</p>
<p>以上都是我們少數人的希望，其結果是否能如預想的美滿，其辦法有無應該糾正的去處，還街會熱心人士多多予以批評與指導。</p>
<p>關於辦學的方針，中華商業專科學校也曾針對現象決定幾點：第一是除了智育以外，同時也注意到人格修養和體格健康。第二是課程採取重點主義，凡認爲與就業不甚重要之課程，寗缺勿濫，以免虛砂學生精力。第三是以刻苦之精神，養成耐勞之習慣。第四减低學費並多設免費學額，使優秀青年不致因家庭經濟問題而向隅。我們最大的希望是整個社會能響應我們辦法，各就所需，各盡其力，紛紛成立各種各色的專科學校。敢信這種努力的結果，到底是不僅助人，還是自助。</p>

<p>中國某基地十九日中央社電　駐渝美空軍曾於十七日下午三時餘，以戰鬥轟炸聯合編隊二十餘架，來襲九江地區。經日戰鬥機隊邀擊，該機倉皇遁走，日軍陸上設施損失輕微。</p>

<h3>賽珍珠　論渝美關係　抨擊美錯誤政策</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　美國著名中國通賽珍珠女士，頃發表一文，題爲美國在中國之最後機會，文內劇烈攻擊美國對中國對印度之錯誤政策。首謂美國近來在中國與印度種下將來亞洲大戰之種子，葢因美國受英國誘導，加强中國人之驚疑與不信賴，目前中國對於美國正抱有日甚一日之憤恨，其原因在美國對於中國槪本其一貫之美國作風所致。美國之青年報人，時以新生美國標準批評有數千年歷史之中國，於是重慶遭受非難。更獎勵此種非難行爲，此實爲令人莫明其妙者。再者由於重慶之</p>
<p>腐敗墮落</p>
<p>使美國人視爲無受美國援助之資格。結論則重慶一如印度，在未得有受援助之資格前，首先必須要統一自身，因此中國數百萬人民一種新憎惡。賽珍珠女士繼更舉美國人對於重慶之四項共同疑問：（一）重慶是否走向獨裁？（二）包圍蔣氏之一般人，能否推擁蔣氏走向獨裁？（三）重慶軍隊可否在蔣氏領導下爲民主主義者？（四）重慶能否對第三項作肯定解釋？後復諭述謂，總之整個中國現在正處於戰爭階段，不能理解中國之物質，便不能理解中國之傾向。美國今日對人。</p>
<p>妄加冷淡</p>
<p>故重慶亦必日與疏遠，在有中國人人所永不忘懷者，其一，重慶擬援助英美處理越南問題，但被拒絕。其後更提議援助英美處理緬甸事件，復以失之過遲而又置諸不問。其二，滇緬公路的喪失對於重慶影響極深，但美國人很少認識其重要性。其三，住於重慶地區之美軍，除極少數外，大都態度傲慢，故未受有美國武器貸與法之利益。其五，美國於中國內地建設多數空軍基地，用費浩大，至今一文未償。其六，僑居重慶地區美人，大都驕橫無禮，凡此等事實，可想而知美國對於中國之友誼空間安在。</p>
<h3>緬佛敎聯盟　斥英美暴行</h3>
<p>仰光十九日中央社電　殘殺無辜民眾，毀炸醫院·學校寺院之渝英美軍非人道行爲，於此次大戰中已不勝枚舉，目下緬甸北部一帶敵軍，正以遊擊之蠢動，破壞寺院及民宅等，最近密芝那近郊，更發生一僧侶之道袍被蹂踏事件，故居民極爲憤激。緬甸敎聯盟，對此種暴行，特於十七日下行，在仰光舉行擁護佛敎聯合大會，通過三項決議案，　渝英美乃緬甸之敵人，自緬甸敗走時，將佛塔及宗敎建築物毀壞無餘，並掠奪寺院實物，佛敎徒對此誓與彼等決戰到底。　英人支配緬甸時，用盡種種機智，而宣揚基督敎，使緬人與佛敎作敵對之信仰，今後緬人誓在同一信仰下，團結一致。　對破壞佛塔及其他宗敎上神聖實物之行爲，本大會當將此種情報予以蒐集記錄，俟戰爭勝利終結時，要求賠償損失。</p>
<h3>渝印航空綫　犧牲慘重</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　紐約電，此間生活雜誌，在其近刊中，載有渝印航空路綫之攝影，說明渝印航空路綫所受犧牲之慘重，據稱，渝之航空路綫，實無異由空中入地獄之路綫，因其所經過路綫，均屬人跡罕少之山地。關於該路綫情形，重慶政權一向嚴禁發表，但在過去二年間，在該航空路綫中，美國空軍人員慘死者，實不知凡　，在此次戰爭中，該航空路綫所受之犧牲，實較其他任何非戰鬥航空路綫爲多，同時，戰鬥航空隊在該綫之損失，亦屬不少。</p>

<p>中太平洋</p>
<p>方面，甲，馬　亞納里島迭尼安島陸上戰鬥，歷時兩句，日守軍集結於該島南部對敵，更猛攻美軍，予以極大打繫，日方亦稍有損傷，邇來，仍於各地，繼續奮戰。十五日各地，繼續奮戰。十五日，十六日，十七日夜間，　敵海上艦艇之照明彈，繼續猛襲美軍陣地。大宮島方面激鬥二旬餘，前綫仍在激戰狀態中，該方面日軍，克服種種困難，刻仍綢續奮戰中。乙，馬紹爾羣島，該方面美軍未作何等活動。又加羅林羣島方面，十三日曾有美大型機二十三架來襲特魯克，是日乳島亦發現美大型飛機四架，但卒為日本戰鬥機隊及高射砲隊等將其繫退。丙。小笠原羣島，敵於八月十二日上午，以大型機十六架轟炸父島，十四日盡間，以二十二架轟炸硫黃島，十六日上午，以十六架轟炸父島，十八日以二十轟炸硫黃島，但經日戰鬥機隊及防空砲火猛烈還繫後，終被繫退，此次來襲敵機，亦有被毀與擊落者。</p>

<h3>南市若千售吸所　竟私自營業</h3>
<p>南市烟賭兩項，經當</p>
<p>局決心禁絕後，全區情況</p>
<p>，現已進入正常軌道，茲</p>
<p>悉各賭窟房屋，悉巳改營</p>
<p>其他業務，賭氛根源，早</p>
<p>已澈底絕減，而供人吸食</p>
<p>烟毒之售吸所，經勒令停</p>
<p>業後。邇來又復死灰復燃</p>
<p>，一部份售吸所，竟私自</p>
<p>恢復營業，亟盼當局本去</p>
<p>毒務盡之旨，嚴加取締。</p>
<h3>油價猛漲　亟盼遏止</h3>
<p>本市戶口油不日即可</p>
<p>賓施配給，而食油價格，</p>
<p>自十八日起反突趨狂漲，</p>
<p>一般市民殊苦不勝負擔，</p>
<p>昨經記者向關係方面探悉</p>
<p>，此次食油猛漲原因，並</p>
<p>非專為戶口油配給價較前</p>
<p>增加百分之六十所致，計</p>
<p>因運輸不便，來源減少</p>
<p>，　因本市各大油廠自電</p>
<p>力節小後，生產減低，</p>
<p>因本市自實施晚問十一時</p>
<p>以後禁用電燈後，一般市</p>
<p>民及各娛樂塲所，咖啡館</p>
<p>，旅館等，均各採用植物</p>
<p>油燃燈，致需要量較前大</p>
<p>增所致。但食油乃市民重</p>
<p>要生活必需品之一，關係</p>
<p>民生甚鉅，甚望當局一面</p>
<p>遏止奸商非法交易，抑低</p>
<p>價格，一面積極疏通來源</p>
<p>，確實維持每期戶口油配</p>
<p>給，以利民生，同時市民</p>
<p>須自動節約。</p>

<h3>蝙蝠的眼睛</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>夏天晚上「吱咳」呌着，飛舞的編蝠，中國人認為是吉祥的動物，</p>
<p>因為中國語言中的　蝠兩字的發普，興便福相同。蝙蝠這兩個字不從犬</p>
<p>傍，而從虫傍，偵是名實相稱的可憐動物。當被人提到時，則在天鵝絨</p>
<p>般的柔軟細毛中，有非用顯微鏡不能發見的那樣小眼晴，恐懼畏續地</p>
<p>縫着看人。或許任何人都會有一次懷疑：這樣小的眼睛怎能在那樣漆黑</p>
<p>的天空中，　捷迅速地飛翔而捕食蚊虫呢？為解答這個疑問，德國一位</p>
<p>動物學家，就曾想出一個實騐辦法。即在　室中縱橫交　起細　的絲線</p>
<p>，把蝙蝠兩眼用針穿破後，放到裘面，但非常奇怪，這隻　目的蝙蝠雖</p>
<p>在暗室內　橫上下　飛着，但卻從未碰到細線上。因此，他認為蝙蝠除</p>
<p>眼睛之外，一定還有某種非常銳敏的感覺，於是就在這一假定下繼績埋</p>
<p>頭研究，結果發見了蝙蝠的皮膚內神經非常發達，縱在空氣震動中稍有</p>
<p>變化，亦能在飛翔中感覺出來，即加以　閃。這樣看來，蝠蝠身體全部</p>
<p>都限像是一個大的眼睛。蝙蝠正好像日本劍道的能手，能感覺到背後砍</p>
<p>來的大刀所引起的風動，於是加以巧妙的躲閃，即能脫險，而具有這種</p>
<p>銳敏感的動物，就是蝙蝠。有些少見多怪的人們，竟不理解賜與個別</p>
<p>生物以可能生存機能的「上帝造物意旨」，而只看見蝙蝠的小限晴，即</p>
<p>狂笑其視綫下靈，進退維艱。</p>
<p>我認為前此恥笑中國</p>
<p>人愚春的許多「支那通」</p>
<p>，也犯了恥笑「蝙蝠眼睛</p>
<p>」的人們的那樣錯誤。按</p>
<p>外國人的眼光說，一般中</p>
<p>國人的知識水準都非常低</p>
<p>，這樣民族是否有精神，</p>
<p>減屬疑間。著名支那通阿</p>
<p>塞爾·斯密司（Arther</p>
<p>H.Smith美國傳教士）曾</p>
<p>判斷中國人的特色，就是</p>
<p>「理智混亂」（Intellect</p>
<p>ual　Turbidity）。他解</p>
<p>釋說：</p>
<p>「中國智愚貧富的差</p>
<p>別，是最懸殊的一個國家</p>
<p>。巨富與赤貧，教養高超</p>
<p>者與日不識丁者這類正相</p>
<p>反的人物，在同一塊地土</p>
<p>上居住着。無數百萬赤貧</p>
<p>而愚鈍的人們，眼界狹小</p>
<p>得非常可　，所以他們的</p>
<p>頭腦不管在主觀上願意與</p>
<p>否，卻都深陷於「理智混</p>
<p>亂」裘。他們的確是井底</p>
<p>觀天之蛙。他們從未到自</p>
<p>己誕生地的十里外去遊過</p>
<p>一趟。他們對於自已周圍</p>
<p>人以外的生活狀熊，是毫</p>
<p>無所知的。這批人中的大</p>
<p>多數，對於一切民族所都</p>
<p>有的好奇心本能，似乎是</p>
<p>冬眠了，或者是菜已疲倦</p>
<p>了。許多巾國人，縱然知</p>
<p>道外國人到自已家一英里</p>
<p>以內的地方來住，但也決</p>
<p>不想去問這個外國人是從</p>
<p>何處而來的，是姓甚名誰</p>
<p>，有何企圖等。他們固然</p>
<p>知道為生存而鬥爭，但除</p>
<p>此外別無所知。他們絲毫</p>
<p>不知道，一般人所相信的</p>
<p>那種　魂，是有三個，還</p>
<p>是一個，抑或是一個也沒</p>
<p>有。他們認為這類與五縠</p>
<p>價格無關的東西，是不層</p>
<p>理論的。他們……是西洋</p>
<p>人所說的「實際主義者」</p>
<p>，即他們的人生，是單純</p>
<p>由口福和腰包二者所構成</p>
<p>的人類力量極端活動的結</p>
<p>果所造成，所以他們是奮</p>
<p>證主義者，除掉自己目所</p>
<p>見耳所聞者外，是任何事</p>
<p>物都不瞭解的，並几主義</p>
<p>之類的觀念，是絕對沒有</p>
<p>的。他們認為生命是事實</p>
<p>的連續，同時也是悲痛事</p>
<p>實的連績，如一超越事實</p>
<p>，則他們同時也是無神論</p>
<p>者，也是受神論者，也是</p>
<p>不可知論者。他們雖然有</p>
<p>時侯跪拜祈禱，但不知道</p>
<p>究竟是向誰跪拜祈禱，雖</p>
<p>然供不祭禮，但不知道究</p>
<p>竟是向　供奉祭禮。他們</p>
<p>唯一的目的就是滿足信教</p>
<p>本能，其他一切都不去計</p>
<p>較。」</p>
<p>然而具有這種表面上</p>
<p>理智混亂的巾國人在民廿</p>
<p>六年以前，既未受到政府</p>
<p>的指導，自然也不是特別</p>
<p>根據世界形勢的分析，當</p>
<p>肯定上海將成為戰塲時，</p>
<p>於是大部份從虹口地區搬</p>
<p>走了。表面上似乎生活是</p>
<p>單純「口福和腰包」二者</p>
<p>構成的這樣中國人，一直</p>
<p>到今天仍然保持着世界上</p>
<p>最古的文化，而在這個生</p>
<p>存競爭最劇烈的世界　，</p>
<p>即將在某種意義上再成為</p>
<p>新的世界頭等強國。看到</p>
<p>這種事實，中國人的確有</p>
<p>我們所不暸解的本能式的</p>
<p>知覺。這正如蝙蝠不用眼</p>
<p>晴而用皮膚的成覺來看東</p>
<p>西一樣，中國人或許用一</p>
<p>種與我們所稱為「理性」</p>
<p>者完全不同的特別感覺來</p>
<p>感知的。然則，這種感覺</p>
<p>的本身究竟是什麽？</p>
<p>孔子會對子貢該過：</p>
<p>「女為君子孺，無為小人</p>
<p>儒」。辜鴻銘解釋這句話</p>
<p>說：「想當大學者，勿忘</p>
<p>成為具有感性的紳士，為</p>
<p>了當大學者，就勿作愚劣</p>
<p>的人物」。此處孔子對於</p>
<p>單純的知職，而強調具有</p>
<p>感性的知識。具有感性的</p>
<p>知識，並非單純在書本上</p>
<p>所能知道的知識，而是溶</p>
<p>解於自己生活中的具有實</p>
<p>感的知識。就是這一點知</p>
<p>道後，給與似乎不能不如</p>
<p>此衝動的知識。就是說，</p>
<p>孔子常常強調具有感情的</p>
<p>知識，即伴隨實行的知識</p>
<p>。孔子說過。「君子欲</p>
<p>於言，面敏於行」，又說</p>
<p>過：「吉者言之不出，恥</p>
<p>躬之不逮也」，孔子還</p>
<p>弟子中的實行派子路說過</p>
<p>：「有聞而未之能行，則</p>
<p>唯恐有聞」。當外在所給</p>
<p>與的知識與內在的經騐相</p>
<p>結合時，方具有實感。在</p>
<p>頭腦中如有一咱經　和另</p>
<p>一經騐相矛盾時，則人發</p>
<p>生疑問。人想解釋這個疑</p>
<p>問，就發生煩悶。這就是</p>
<p>想追求知識的關係。此時</p>
<p>如敎員給以適當解釋的知</p>
<p>識，則頭腦巾前比相互矛</p>
<p>盾的兩個經騐即和解而一</p>
<p>致。於是才獲到與經騐相</p>
<p>結合的寶感之知識。孔子</p>
<p>曾重視獲得實感知識時的</p>
<p>這種理性方面的煩悶。因</p>
<p>此孔子說過：「不曰如之</p>
<p>何如之何者，吾未如之何</p>
<p>也已矣」，又在另一地方</p>
<p>說過：「學而不思則　，</p>
<p>思而不學則始」。此處所</p>
<p>說的「思」，就是我所說</p>
<p>的知的煩悶。孔十起初固</p>
<p>然說過：「思無益，不如</p>
<p>學」的話，但　純學絕是</p>
<p>不行的。與學同時，如不</p>
<p>發生知識煩悶，則知識不</p>
<p>會成為具有實感者，即成</p>
<p>為孔子所說之「罔」；反</p>
<p>過來說，如單純有知識煩</p>
<p>悶而不學，則不會有推步</p>
<p>，即陷於孔子所說之「殆</p>
<p>」。因此孔子常常對着中</p>
<p>國人強調具有實感的知識</p>
<p>，具有感性的頭腦。而不</p>
<p>具有感性的頭腦，德國人</p>
<p>稱之為石頭（Stein　Kop</p>
<p>ff）最能具體表現感性知</p>
<p>識或實感知識者，就是兒</p>
<p>童的知識。兄童所知道的</p>
<p>，同時對於他也就是實在</p>
<p>的。兒　之所以知道幽靈</p>
<p>鬼怪，就是閃为他們認為</p>
<p>幽　鬼怪實際上威脋着他</p>
<p>們。辜鴻銘所說的中國人</p>
<p>是具有「兒　心理」的民</p>
<p>族，也是指這一點面百。</p>
<p>鴻鉻根據這一觀點，說</p>
<p>明中国人如下：</p>
<p>「中国人一直到今天</p>
<p>渡着兒童生活，心的生活</p>
<p>（A　life　of　theheart）。因</p>
<p>此中國人在民族方面說，</p>
<p>固然是古老的民族，然而</p>
<p>一直到今天仍然是幼稚民</p>
<p>族。但尤其重要者，即渡</p>
<p>着心的生活的這個幼惟民</p>
<p>族，實在生活方面有許多</p>
<p>原始形態，然而却具有原</p>
<p>始民族所不能有的精神力</p>
<p>與理性（A　power　of　mi</p>
<p>nd　and　rationalitty）。</p>
<p>中國人在這種精神力與理</p>
<p>性的指導下，對於社會生</p>
<p>活，政府和文明的困難複</p>
<p>雜問題，都能加以順利的</p>
<p>解決……我在此特別要</p>
<p>指出者，即中國人値得令</p>
<p>人　奇的特色，實際上並</p>
<p>非中國人單單渡着心的生</p>
<p>活，因為一切原始民族也</p>
<p>渡着心的生活。同时就我</p>
<p>所知，小世紀的歐洲基督</p>
<p>教徒也曾渡過心的生活。</p>
<p>馬肅·亞諾于爾德說過：「</p>
<p>中世紀基督教的詩，是由</p>
<p>心和想像所形成」。然而</p>
<p>我要特別指出，中國人値</p>
<p>得驚奇的特色，是中國人</p>
<p>一方面渡着心的生活和兒</p>
<p>童生活，同時又握有中世</p>
<p>紀基督教徒以及其他原始</p>
<p>民族所沒有的精神力與理</p>
<p>性。換言之，中國人的驚</p>
<p>人特色，就是長大的民族</p>
<p>，理性成熟的民族，且具</p>
<p>有那樣悠久歷史的民族，</p>
<p>反而一直到今天仍然渡着</p>
<p>心的生活和兒童生活。因</p>
<p>此便有人說，中國是停止</p>
<p>成長和發展的民族，然而</p>
<p>寶際上，中國人是決不成</p>
<p>為衰老的民族。總之，中</p>
<p>華民族的驚人特色，就是</p>
<p>人民知道永久保持靑春秘</p>
<p>決的」。</p>
<p>前面所　出來的阿</p>
<p>爾·斯密司，以及其他許</p>
<p>多外國人，在中國不能發</p>
<p>見——唯其不能發兌，而</p>
<p>才完全不能理解中國人及</p>
<p>其文化——者，老實說，</p>
<p>這就是中國人的特色。再</p>
<p>重覆一句說，中國人是「</p>
<p>擁有大人頭腦和兒童心理</p>
<p>的民族」。這就是說，中</p>
<p>國人是用頭腦理解事物，</p>
<p>而用情感感知事物的民族</p>
<p>。中國人之於感知，正像</p>
<p>兒童對於喜歡的大人和討</p>
<p>厭的大人，一望即可感知</p>
<p>一樣，這並非按推理力，</p>
<p>而是按「感性」力。所以</p>
<p>中國人決不能說是具有銳</p>
<p>利「感性」的民族。阿塞</p>
<p>爾·斯密司說中國人的思</p>
<p>想方法，是缺乏正確性（</p>
<p>Want　of　exactness）的</p>
<p>。這或許是對的，但中國</p>
<p>人是用心比用頭思索更多</p>
<p>的民族。至於心，姑　再</p>
<p>用事鴻銘的話來說。「是</p>
<p>非常敏感而精　的均性。</p>
<p>它並不是像頭腦那樣堅固</p>
<p>而嚴格的機關。所以心恩</p>
<p>考就不能像頭那樣思考得</p>
<p>正確。假如說這話是錯誤</p>
<p>的，但最低限度可以說，</p>
<p>心思考得正確，是一件極</p>
<p>困難的事。中國人寫字所</p>
<p>用者，不用鋼筆或鉛筆，</p>
<p>而用毛筆，但也可以說，</p>
<p>只有毛筆才是中國人的心</p>
<p>之象徵。用毛筆寫字畫畫</p>
<p>，固然非常困難，然其用</p>
<p>法純熟後，則能表現鋼筆</p>
<p>所不能表現的美麗和風趣</p>
<p>。」</p>
<p>在中國話中，一向是</p>
<p>沒有等於論理學這樣名詞</p>
<p>的。淪理學或許是必須用</p>
<p>頭腦思老的，但對於用心</p>
<p>思考的中國人說，是不十</p>
<p>分必要的。用心思考者，</p>
<p>並不以論理學為武器，而</p>
<p>以情感的精　性（Dclicac</p>
<p>y）和感受性（Sensibiltt</p>
<p>y）為武器。正如那樣小</p>
<p>眼睛的蝙蝠擁有在黑暗的</p>
<p>空中飛舞而能捕食小蚊虫</p>
<p>的神秘感覺一樣，小國人</p>
<p>是有敏捷的心的感性和精</p>
<p>緻性，藉此而才能渡過五</p>
<p>千年來世界上熾烈的生存</p>
<p>競爭過程。這是一件偉大</p>
<p>的事蹟。</p>
<p>許多外國人忽略了這</p>
<p>一步，所以認為中國人是</p>
<p>思考力薄弱而容易受　的</p>
<p>民族。淸朝末業以來，巾</p>
<p>國人渴想本國近代化的時</p>
<p>侯，外國人就都爭先恐後</p>
<p>—甚至吵鬧起來—想幫助</p>
<p>中國近代化。有的借與鐵</p>
<p>路建設資金，有的成立教</p>
<p>會，開設醫院，有的沒立</p>
<p>學堂教育中國子弟等，諸</p>
<p>如此類，不一而足。這全</p>
<p>都是中國近代化所必要者</p>
<p>。外國人說巾國人對於這</p>
<p>若干援助，應對他們表示</p>
<p>謝意。然而不用頭腦思考</p>
<p>而用心思考的巾國人，曾</p>
<p>是極說利的觀察者，正如</p>
<p>阿塞爾·斯密司所承認者</p>
<p>，「中國人只是堅信自己</p>
<p>想要改革的中華帝國，而</p>
<p>不承認列強對於中國的改</p>
<p>革被更高的理想所推動的</p>
<p>」。中國人在此處也由於</p>
<p>銳利的感受性，而達到正</p>
<p>確思考所能達到的同一結</p>
<p>論。中國人固然不能正確</p>
<p>知道外國人的援助，給果</p>
<p>將使中國成為「俎上肉」</p>
<p>，但卻能正確感覺到點一</p>
<p>點。</p>
<p>至此我想作一結論。</p>
<p>目前日木是承認中國自由</p>
<p>獨立平等的。日本政府承</p>
<p>認中國自由獨立平等這一</p>
<p>概念，就是個別日本人必</p>
<p>須承認個別中國人是平等</p>
<p>的獨立國之人民。至於個</p>
<p>別日本人對於中國人是否</p>
<p>衷心而　學地如此想，是</p>
<p>否對這樣國策是有誠實性</p>
<p>，這對於感受性強大的中</p>
<p>國人說，是立刻用心可以</p>
<p>感覺到的。孔子所說的「</p>
<p>巧言令色鮮矣仁」的仁字</p>
<p>，就是指人類關係上的誠</p>
<p>實性而言。沒有　實性的</p>
<p>巧言令色，是在中國人中</p>
<p>不能通　的。</p>
<p>日前我在申報上發表</p>
<p>了一篇「小題大作」的文</p>
<p>章，而指出日本人的某種</p>
<p>錯誤觀念，於是就有人狗</p>
<p>血噴頭地指問孜：「家</p>
<p>不可外揚，你為什麽不穩</p>
<p>瞞日本人對中國人的為非</p>
<p>作歹。而竟向中國人發表</p>
<p>了呢？」但我認為：為什</p>
<p>對於誓言同生共死的中</p>
<p>國人，只能歌頌日本人的</p>
<p>功德，而不能揭穿日本人</p>
<p>的狂妄。每個日本人還</p>
<p>要夜深人靜捫心自問，自</p>
<p>己對於「同生共死」這一</p>
<p>口號，是保持着幾許忠實</p>
<p>性。就是「君十恥其言過</p>
<p>其行」的意想。君子也是</p>
<p>有「言」過於「行」的時</p>
<p>候。而我們老早就「言」</p>
<p>過了，但現在問題是在於</p>
<p>怎樣使「行」趕上「言」</p>
<p>。我毫不懷疑，假如每個</p>
<p>日本人在實行時能有這樣</p>
<p>的自我反省，則感受性強</p>
<p>大的中國人心，一定會銳</p>
<p>敏地感受到這一點。因為</p>
<p>中國人對於日本人所作的</p>
<p>堂哉皇哉的大東亞理諭，</p>
<p>是不想聽的，而是想用心</p>
<p>感受實行中所表現的誠實</p>
<p>性的。（魯譯）</p>

<h3>心弦小語</h3>
<p>— 朱懿凡</p>
<p>為紀念昕而作</p>
<p>昨天你到我這兄來，看了我玻子杯下</p>
<p>壓着的那個紙條兒，就儘抿着嘴笑</p>
<p>。我問你笑着什麽來，你祇　瞪了我</p>
<p>一眼，也不回答我。倚在桌邊，兩個眸子睜得</p>
<p>圓圓的，望着窗外的白雲沉思着。房間裘靜寂</p>
<p>得連你我心房的跳動也聽得出來。我從後面輕</p>
<p>步走過來，捉住你的手，握得緊緊地，你即刻</p>
<p>用力抒脫了，臉上泛起一陣紅暈，飛也似的逃</p>
<p>到窗前，太陽的光彩淋了你一身，在紅霞的映</p>
<p>照下，你顯得更美麗嫵媚了。</p>
<p>「你現在怎樣？」你反過臉來問我。</p>
<p>跳出　愛迷津</p>
<p>，打破經濟</p>
<p>支配，即天</p>
<p>上神仙，人</p>
<p>間活佛。」這紙條是從一</p>
<p>本雜誌上剪了留下來的，</p>
<p>在後面我自己還特別注了</p>
<p>幾個字：「我很自負，我</p>
<p>雖然窮，可是還不致於受</p>
<p>經濟的支配，關於　愛，</p>
<p>我也深知自己條件的不夠</p>
<p>，不敢貿然涉足，既然沒</p>
<p>有進門，自然也無須跳川</p>
<p>了。」所以我以前的生活</p>
<p>竟平淡得一如死水，雖然</p>
<p>偶或覺得乏味，究竟也安</p>
<p>然渡了過來。可是自從你</p>
<p>跨進了我的生活圈子，我</p>
<p>再也抑不住自己的心情了</p>
<p>。你在我的生命裏，投下</p>
<p>了一塊小石子，平靜的水</p>
<p>面立刻起了圈圈的浪花。</p>
<p>「你現在怎樣？」</p>
<p>我知道你是故意問着</p>
<p>我的，看你問時，還帶着</p>
<p>俏皮的笑，像是春天的花</p>
<p>朵，受着溫煦的陽光一樣</p>
<p>滕利的笑。你問得突兀，</p>
<p>我可　給呆住了。這呌我</p>
<p>答你些什麽呢？今天獨自</p>
<p>思索著的時候，可給我想</p>
<p>出個答語來了：</p>
<p>「我是人呢！你說我</p>
<p>怎生跳得出？」</p>
<p>有一天晚上，</p>
<p>我們看戲出</p>
<p>來，我送你</p>
<p>回家，走在</p>
<p>灰黃的燈光下，兩條影子</p>
<p>拖得長長地，秋風吹來，</p>
<p>大家有些寒意，你靠得我</p>
<p>很近，　也沒說話。可是</p>
<p>兩顆心早溶在一起了，我</p>
<p>突然問了你一句：</p>
<p>「你會永遠在我身旁</p>
<p>？」</p>
<p>雖是　輕地一　，卻</p>
<p>也把冷寂的空氣衝破了。</p>
<p>你沒有回答我，空氣又在</p>
<p>我們四週凝固了。祇有梧</p>
<p>桐葉在秋風中發抖，索索</p>
<p>作聲。隔了上會，你說：</p>
<p>「你不相信？」</p>
<p>我還想說什麼，可是</p>
<p>你已經到了家了。</p>
<p>說　的，我有</p>
<p>些信不過，</p>
<p>這不是說我</p>
<p>在懷疑你，</p>
<p>實在是怕我自己沒有將來</p>
<p>，會毀了你。以你的美麗</p>
<p>和所受的教育來說，我是</p>
<p>相差得太遠了：我沒有就</p>
<p>過方帽子，在社會上混了</p>
<p>多少年，　是空空的一雙</p>
<p>手，將來也決隊不來大錢</p>
<p>，發不了大財。我這樣培</p>
<p>近你，覺得是件不應該的</p>
<p>事，是近乎殘酷的。所以</p>
<p>有時侯心裏雖願意站得你</p>
<p>更近些，可是又想起來了</p>
<p>：「不要毀了她呵！」我</p>
<p>的心立刻就往下沉，近來</p>
<p>連約你一塊看戲的勇氣也</p>
<p>消失了說起看戲，上個月</p>
<p>我們會去看過「浮生六記</p>
<p>」。劇中主人翁洛拓淡泊</p>
<p>的個性，旣不善　！又不</p>
<p>重視金銀物；芸雖是個溫</p>
<p>柔體貼的女子，然而在愗</p>
<p>米缺柴之餘，　房之樂趣</p>
<p>，也就頓減。次坷一生，</p>
<p>老境更屬可悲，　直在飢</p>
<p>寒中忍受生活的煎　了。</p>
<p>這樣慘絕的遭遇，還不夠</p>
<p>我警惕？這劇情　深深地</p>
<p>刺傷了我的心。走出戲院</p>
<p>，淚痕似還未乾，我想對</p>
<p>你直說了：「讓我　你遠</p>
<p>一些吧！」其實祇有這樣</p>
<p>，才於你是幸福的。但是</p>
<p>不知怎樣，我終於不忍說</p>
<p>出來。</p>
<p>你是個生長在</p>
<p>上海的小姐</p>
<p>，我想你總</p>
<p>不會茫然於</p>
<p>上海的環境，你知道近年</p>
<p>來上海更形奢華了。一切</p>
<p>物質上享受的貪婪心誰都</p>
<p>有，我不輕看你；但是無</p>
<p>論如何，我不把你看作超</p>
<p>人，以為在你身上連一點</p>
<p>虛榮好勝都找不出。其實</p>
<p>，你那裘有錯？錯的正是</p>
<p>我。我想假使我手中有錢</p>
<p>，不是什麽也沒問題了嗎</p>
<p>？所可惜的，我正缺少錢</p>
<p>。這問題在愛戀期中，自</p>
<p>然不會嚴重。我們今天袋</p>
<p>裹空着，不一定要去影院</p>
<p>或其他消耗塲所；我們在</p>
<p>馬路上蕩上整個半天，也</p>
<p>一樣情濃意密而不覺得疲</p>
<p>倦。但是我們不能單</p>
<p>前，對不對？許多悲劇的</p>
<p>造成，就為了太少想到未</p>
<p>來。我們閉目一想，肚子</p>
<p>空，身上冷，這日子將怎</p>
<p>樣打發？「浮生六記」裏</p>
<p>的悲局該是個好的對照。</p>
<p>你還似乎年靑，而且天眞</p>
<p>，家庭環境本來就不壞，</p>
<p>這些事情你根本想不到，</p>
<p>或許我說了你還不懂。今</p>
<p>天我無意寫在這裹，我怕</p>
<p>你會誤解而刺痛你的心，</p>
<p>但是這倒的確是我數月來</p>
<p>積壓在心頭的話。</p>
<p>今天你仍來我</p>
<p>這兒，我沒</p>
<p>有以前那樣</p>
<p>熱烈的接待</p>
<p>你，我想離你遠一些，你</p>
<p>也許會不快業，看你的臉</p>
<p>色就不大好看，但這於你</p>
<p>是幸一福的。</p>
<p>你總懂得我的意思，</p>
<p>是不是？</p>
<h3>憶兒時　童年生活片段</h3>
<p>— 胡伊</p>
<p>「春去秋來。遊子傷　泊，憶兄時，光景</p>
<p>宛如昨？……」當我緩步低徊地吟着這首詩的</p>
<p>時侯，偶然瞥見窗外的垂柳不知在什麽時候已</p>
<p>萌出了嫩綠的新芽，造物者　示，現在又是桃</p>
<p>花紅，菜花黃的時節了。</p>
<p>往事是值得回味的，每逢到了這個時節，</p>
<p>我便會觸景生情地緬想起童時時代一段令人</p>
<p>的往事來！</p>
<p>在我六歲那年吧！</p>
<p>也是一個風和日　的</p>
<p>春天，我和妹妹為了要換</p>
<p>個環境居住，我們就被媽</p>
<p>媽送到故鄉祖父那裹去。</p>
<p>因為一向不跟　父往</p>
<p>在上槐，所以對於他是非</p>
<p>常的生疏和隔膜，可以說</p>
<p>根本還不認識他，在我們</p>
<p>第一次見到他的時候，媽</p>
<p>媽牽了我的小手走到他而</p>
<p>前，命我嘆他一聲「爺爺</p>
<p>」，那時我　大了限晴，</p>
<p>怔怔地對着他痴　，感到</p>
<p>一切都陌生，而且　　此</p>
<p>畏　。</p>
<p>祖父滿臉堆着笑容，</p>
<p>把我抱到他的　上坐着，</p>
<p>一雙乾　的手撫摸　我的</p>
<p>血頰，很關切地問我：</p>
<p>「大　，　了吧？累</p>
<p>不累呢？」這種柔和而</p>
<p>的　　　　我的耳　，</p>
<p>素來不　叫人的我，居然</p>
<p>很乖巧的對他　出了一句</p>
<p>：</p>
<p>「爺爺！我有點餓了</p>
<p>。」他見我開了口，高興</p>
<p>得很，抬頭望着媽媽，很</p>
<p>得意又像在稱讀似的說：</p>
<p>「這孩子朮極了！」說着</p>
<p>一面把我抱下來，帶我去</p>
<p>拿糕吃。雖然和祖父是第</p>
<p>一次見面，他卻給予我一</p>
<p>個深刻慈愛的印象。</p>
<p>祖父的受我們，可說</p>
<p>是斯微不至了；每天清早</p>
<p>，他親自上菜場去，回來</p>
<p>提了滿滿一　都是我們愛</p>
<p>吃的東西，大　蝦啊，活</p>
<p>鯽魚啊，還有肥鷄，　蛋</p>
<p>和一根根嫩綠色的鮮葛筍</p>
<p>，還有—好吃的東西太多</p>
<p>了！祖父不單對於我們的</p>
<p>飲食很注意，就是對於我</p>
<p>們的健康也非常關心，他</p>
<p>要我們的生活有記　，每</p>
<p>天太陽還本升起　就　喚</p>
<p>醒我們了，梳洗完畢，吃</p>
<p>過點心，攜了我們的手到</p>
<p>後園去看日出，那時，他</p>
<p>吿訴我們太陽時從那一方</p>
<p>升起，那一方降落，並且</p>
<p>指着千變萬化的晨曦呌我</p>
<p>們辨別它的顏色。記得那</p>
<p>時咩妹常把紫色和藍色分</p>
<p>別不淸，現在想起來眞是</p>
<p>好笑哩。</p>
<p>夕陽拖着疲倦的步伐</p>
<p>慢慢地滾下山去，風已帶</p>
<p>些涼意，滿天散怖着血紅</p>
<p>的晚霞，在那美麗如書的</p>
<p>大自然懷抱中，祖父帶了</p>
<p>我和妹妹，緩緩地沿着小</p>
<p>溪散步，一路上他吿訴我</p>
<p>們關於農家的常識和有趣</p>
<p>的故事，有時他會蹲在田</p>
<p>間的小道上採了些碧綠的</p>
<p>小草，吿訴我們這是草頭</p>
<p>，或是指着河里一堆黑黝</p>
<p>黝的小動物，告訴我們那</p>
<p>是蝌蚪。夕陽的餘輝就在</p>
<p>我們邊談邊走之中漸漸地</p>
<p>消失了。</p>
<p>除了每天早晚兩次散</p>
<p>步之外，他囑咐家人不要</p>
<p>讓我們兩個小孩子跑出大</p>
<p>門，因為鄉間的野犬很多</p>
<p>，到處又曲迥着小河，孩</p>
<p>子們沒有大人帶着總是不</p>
<p>放心的。</p>
<p>一天下午，天氣異常</p>
<p>的淸則，太陽也格外的和</p>
<p>煦。祖父在上午就　鄰家</p>
<p>邀去吃飯了，祖母和嬸嬸</p>
<p>都在廚房里忙著做圓子，</p>
<p>那時妹妹和我留在樓上玩</p>
<p>耍，感到非常的寂寞無聊</p>
<p>，窗外的柳樹校上有幾雙</p>
<p>小鳥，正在吱吱　喳地呌</p>
<p>個不休，我們被這種淸脆</p>
<p>悅耳的聲首吸引住了，不</p>
<p>約而同地爬到窗口的一張</p>
<p>桌上，出　地對那幾隻不</p>
<p>怕人的小島望着，忽然妹</p>
<p>妹把我的裙子拉了一下。</p>
<p>「什麼事啊」？我回</p>
<p>過頭來問她。</p>
<p>「姊姊！你看！」妹</p>
<p>妹伸出一個指頭，笑嘻嘻</p>
<p>地輕聲回答，我順着她指</p>
<p>的方向望去，只見田間的</p>
<p>橋邊有四五個和我們年齡</p>
<p>相　的女孩子在玩耍着，</p>
<p>一個蹲在地上，兩個站在</p>
<p>旁邊，注視着水里，還有</p>
<p>幾個拍着手在跳躍，一陣</p>
<p>銀鈴似的笑聲隨風傳淮我</p>
<p>的耳里，我快樂得不禁也</p>
<p>張了嘴隨着她們笑。</p>
<p>「姊姊！」妹妹又是</p>
<p>一拉。</p>
<p>「什麽！」我有點神</p>
<p>往了，全副精神　注到橋</p>
<p>邊去。</p>
<p>「我們到那邊去好嗎</p>
<p>？」妹妹湊近我的耳</p>
<p>怯地問。</p>
<p>「好！…不，要是給</p>
<p>爺爺知道……」</p>
<p>「爺爺不在家啊！我</p>
<p>們輕輕的溜出去，君一俞</p>
<p>兒就回來好了！」妹妹胸</p>
<p>有成竹地獻計，我的心也</p>
<p>動了，兩人爬下桌子，</p>
<p>手躡脚地下了樓梯，走出</p>
<p>大門，一口須奔到橋邊。</p>
<p>看淸楚了，原來　在地上</p>
<p>的女孩是她們常中最大的</p>
<p>一個，大家呌好靑姊姊，</p>
<p>我們也跟着呌了。她的手</p>
<p>中執着一個魚網，網里有</p>
<p>條大魚不住地跳着，旁邊</p>
<p>四個孩子都樂得于舞足蹈</p>
<p>起來。靑姊姊用純熟的手</p>
<p>法把竹竿向下一量，另一</p>
<p>隻手伸進網中取魚，取出</p>
<p>來放在一個木桶里，一次</p>
<p>最少有一條，不一會，木</p>
<p>桶生已　了三四條魚。正</p>
<p>在　得有味時，妹妹又拉</p>
<p>了我的裙子：</p>
<p>「姊姊，我們回去吧</p>
<p>！」</p>
<p>「再等一會兒，忙什</p>
<p>麽！」我偵有點捨不得走</p>
<p>靑姊姊一網又一網地</p>
<p>撈着，本桶里快要感滿了</p>
<p>，忽然她呌了一聲：「看</p>
<p>哪！」一面用力把網舉起</p>
<p>，我想：這條魚一定特別</p>
<p>的大了，不禁也替她歡喜</p>
<p>，她帶着微笑伸手去拿魚</p>
<p>，大概魚太大的緣故，她</p>
<p>的一隻小手按不住魚的跳</p>
<p>躍，一滑就給牠跳出手堂</p>
<p>了，那時恰巧妹妹站在她</p>
<p>身邊，那條大魚偏偏跳到</p>
<p>妹妹的臉上，妹妹一驚，</p>
<p>向後退了兩步，誰知後而</p>
<p>有一條小溪，妹妹一滑腳</p>
<p>就掉到水里去了。</p>
<p>一羣眉開眼笑的孩子</p>
<p>，頓時嚇得目瞪口呆，靑</p>
<p>姊姊畢竟年紀比我們都大</p>
<p>點，有了王意，她通忙站</p>
<p>起來招呼大家快走下石級</p>
<p>把妹妹拉了起來，好在那</p>
<p>兒水很淺，沒有淹着，但</p>
<p>是已弄得滿身污泥了。</p>
<p>妹妹帶着一副啼笑皆</p>
<p>非的神情對我望着，我呢</p>
<p>，早就嚇得果若木鵝，眼</p>
<p>看她們拉起妹妹，替她揩</p>
<p>去臉上和身上的泥漿，卻</p>
<p>嚇得一句話也說不出來。</p>
<p>祖父不讓我們自己亂</p>
<p>跑出去，恐怕小孩好奇心</p>
<p>重，又喜冒險，容易發生�</p>
<p>意外，這是他的經騐談啊！</p>

<p>游泳一項，在滬上素似以娛樂為主，極鮮良好成績，此要亦環境使</p>

<p>六屆全運水上競技，不論男女冠軍，咸為人材平均之廣東隊所攫去，而</p>
<p>香港賴有特出之陳振興楊秀　輩，得獲男女個人冠軍。其中尤以美人魚</p>
<p>楊秀瓊之健美風姿，風麽整個社會，而滬上男子方面，僅恃梁偉生施博</p>
<p>根兩人，勉力奪得幾分。女子方而雖亦有六將參加，然竟全部名落孫山</p>
<p>，於此足以證明滬上對此貢戲之少。</p>

<h3>The Significance of Cultivating Practical Industrial and Commercial Talents</h3>
<p>— Tang Shoumin</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the prosperity and decline of a nation's fortunes, and the success or failure of its undertakings, have invariably been linked to the waxing and waning of talent. Thus, gaining talent leads to prosperity, and losing talent leads to decline, a timeless adage. In the political sphere, there are countless examples, requiring no further enumeration. Even in the realm of social enterprises, based on my decades of experience in the business world, any industry that secures talented individuals can expect success, regardless of the initial difficulties, limited capital, rudimentary equipment, or narrow scope. Moreover, it can be expanded and glorified, never fleeting like a short-lived bloom. This principle holds true in every instance. Therefore, when friends and relatives seek my advice on establishing a business, I invariably offer "securing talent" as the primary contribution.</p>
<p>As for the methods of securing talent, within an organization, they consist of setting standards and earnestly seeking qualified individuals. However, for society as a whole, it is necessary to cultivate talent according to the needs, only then can talents emerge in abundance and supply be inexhaustible. For many years, an extreme contradiction has existed in society. On one hand, every enterprise feels unable to find suitable talent to complete a sound cadre. Yet, on the other hand, the number of unemployed people in society increases year by year. Consequently, one often hears the slogan "graduation equals unemployment." This must be attributed to the lack of connection between educational institutions and enterprises, as well as the lack of thorough consideration and appropriate guidance when young students pursue further education.</p>
<p>The underdevelopment of various industries in our country is not solely a matter of capital, but also a matter of talent, especially the lack of practical talent, which affects the rationalization of any industry. Practical talent does not require profound academic theories, but rather a thorough understanding and comprehension of the work being handled, and the ability to carry it out effectively. Furthermore, each industry has different characteristics, and practical talent must be individually trained to meet each specific need. The Management Department of National Jiaotong University was established based on this very principle. Therefore, when graduates of the Management Department are assigned to various railways, they can achieve considerable accomplishments, and the railway administration can see improvements. This is a prime example of how cultivating practical talent can best assist in the development of an enterprise.</p>
<p>Industry, commerce, and finance are the backbone of China's economic construction, but if we want industry, commerce, and finance to flourish, we must first pay attention to enriching the internal ranks with practical talent. In recent years, I have repeatedly exchanged views on this matter with leaders in the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors, and they all share the same sentiment. Moreover, this ideal is now becoming a reality. The China Business College, initiated and established by the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors, was founded with this very purpose in mind. Our greatest objective in establishing this school is to create professional youth and correct the past phenomenon of graduation equaling unemployment. At the same time, we also hope to improve the efficiency of work in the general industry and reduce unnecessary losses to the national economy.</p>
<p>The above are the hopes of a few of us. Whether the results will be as satisfactory as we anticipate, and whether there are any aspects of our methods that should be corrected, we still hope that enthusiastic individuals will provide much criticism and guidance.</p>
<p>Regarding the school's operational policies, China Business College has also determined several points in response to the current situation: First, in addition to intellectual education, we also pay attention to personality cultivation and physical health. Second, the curriculum adopts a focus on key subjects, and any course deemed not very important for employment will be omitted rather than included superficially, to avoid wasting students' energy. Third, cultivate a spirit of perseverance and develop habits of hard work. Fourth, reduce tuition fees and provide more free scholarships so that outstanding young people are not turned away due to family financial problems. Our greatest hope is that the entire society can respond to our methods, each according to their needs, each doing their best, and establishing various specialized schools of different types. We believe that the result of this effort will ultimately be not only helping others, but also helping ourselves.</p>
<h3>The House of Peers Will Fully Cooperate to Realize Various Policies Earlier; A National Movement Will Be Launched After the End of the Diet Session</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - With the imminent convocation of the Extraordinary Diet, the various factions of the House of Peers have carefully considered how to expedite the implementation of various government decisive battle policies and to fully cooperate in actively promoting them. They have decided on two concrete policies: To deliberate on the most essential and indispensable policies during wartime, to focus on arguments, and to ensure that the people gain a proper understanding of them, so as to take comprehensive measures to uplift the spirit of war. The activities of existing research committees will actively assist the government's decisive battle policies. At the same time, individual Diet members will also engage in encouraging overall war power and promoting the realization of policies. The focus of the above two issues is, on the one hand, to rapidly implement decisive battle production increase policies to supply the needs of front-line soldiers, and on the other hand, to ensure food supplies in order to strengthen post-war production. Therefore, more than ten authorities within the research committee have been specially selected to form an iron ore investigation team to decide on reviewing various countermeasures. Furthermore, meetings of various factions to discuss the order of Diet operations will be held after the government decides to submit bills. This Diet session is regarded as an excellent opportunity for the Koiso Cabinet to declare its determination to complete the war under national armament to both domestic and foreign audiences, so it is hoped that its operation will be perfect.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Rule Assistance Association held a standing general affairs meeting at its headquarters on the afternoon of the 18th. First, President Kobayashi reported on the discussions with Prime Minister Koiso on the 16th regarding the operation of the Extraordinary Diet. Then, Minister of Practical Affairs Takahashi proposed that because of the increasing gravity of the war situation, the significance of this Extraordinary Diet is particularly significant. The government needs to clarify the policy direction at home and abroad, and the people's determination to complete the war will also be demonstrated, and the war situation will be clarified. Therefore, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association will take this opportunity to strongly launch a national movement united as one after the end of the Diet session. For this purpose, when deliberating on bills, public opinion will be reflected in the Diet, and at the same time, the government will be requested to incorporate this into the policy and realize it. In addition, with this as a prerequisite, all Diet members of each department will be mobilized and dispatched to various places to investigate local conditions and trends of public opinion, and based on these results, use them as materials for proposals in the Diet. Later, it was decided that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association would immediately launch a decisive battle national movement.</p>
<h3>Japan's Aircraft Production Is Progressing Smoothly, All Technical Personnel Have Been Mobilized</h3>

Therefore, the increase in aircraft production is now progressing smoothly. Furthermore, the Extraordinary Diet of the Koiso Cabinet will be held in early next month, taking this opportunity to clarify the determination to complete the war and the concrete measures under the decisive battle. Therefore, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has already drafted the "Emergency Policy Outline." The House of Peers Investigation Committee has also formulated "Emergency Labor Countermeasures" and is preparing to submit them at the opening of the Extraordinary Diet. According to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association's demands, activities related to both food and political warfare, ensuring military supplies and food production, and establishing a sure-win domestic system are all required.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - Since Mr. Toshio Shiratori, the former ambassador to Italy, took office as the chairman of the Japan Post-War Management Research Committee, he has actively gathered authorities from all walks of life to engage in research work. On the 18th, a regular meeting was held at the Imperial Hotel here, and the draft of "Principles for Establishing a New World Order" was passed. From now on, the following three principles will be implemented to promote Pan-Asianism and counter the American policy of the strong preying on the weak and dominating the world: To implement good-neighborly friendship and joint defense to counter the Anglo-American imperialist policy of distant alliances and near attacks. To implement economic reciprocity and cultural exchange to counter Anglo-American economic monopoly and self-righteous culture. As for the specific countermeasures, the world will be divided into several national groups, such as East Asia, Europe, South America, and North America after the war. Among the countries constituting this national group and between national groups, the principles of joint defense and reciprocal economy will be further implemented. Each national group will be composed of independent countries bordering each other and having a population of 5 million. In each national group, the constituent countries will negotiate and guide the country. The guiding country should be responsible for promoting good-neighborly friendship, joint defense, and reciprocal economy among the countries within the national group and other group members. Disputes among the constituent countries or national groups should be resolved jointly by countries or groups other than the country or group in question. After the above proposal is finalized and submitted to the government for further review, the implementation method will be promoted immediately.</p>

<h3>Pearl Buck Discusses Chongqing-U.S. Relations, Criticizes Erroneous U.S. Policies</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - American Sinologist Pearl Buck recently published an article entitled "America's Last Chance in China," in which she vehemently attacked the erroneous American policies towards China and India. She stated that the United States has recently sown the seeds of a major Asian war in China and India because the United States, under the guidance of Britain, has intensified the suspicions and distrust of the Chinese. Currently, China harbors increasing resentment towards the United States, which is due to the fact that the United States is essentially adopting its consistent American style towards China. Young American journalists often criticize China, which has a history of thousands of years, with the new American standards, thus Chongqing is subjected to criticism. Furthermore, encouraging such criticism is truly baffling. Moreover, due to Chongqing's</p>
<p>corruption and degeneration</p>
<p>Americans regard it as unqualified to receive American aid. In conclusion, Chongqing, like India, must first unify itself before it is qualified to receive aid, thus causing a new hatred among millions of Chinese people. Pearl Buck further cited four common questions Americans have regarding Chongqing: (1) Is Chongqing heading towards dictatorship? (2) Can the people surrounding Chiang Kai-shek support him in heading towards dictatorship? (3) Can the Chongqing army be democratic under Chiang Kai-shek's leadership? (4) Can Chongqing give an affirmative explanation to the third question? Later, she elaborated that, in short, the entire China is currently in a state of war. Those who cannot understand China's materials cannot understand China's tendencies. The United States is now being</p>
<p>indifferent</p>
<p>Therefore, Chongqing will inevitably become more estranged day by day. Among the things that the Chinese people will never forget, one is that Chongqing intended to assist the British and Americans in dealing with the Vietnam issue, but was rejected. Later, it proposed to assist the British and Americans in dealing with the Burma event, but was again put aside due to being too late. Second, the loss of the Burma Road had a profound impact on Chongqing, but few Americans recognized its importance. Third, the American troops stationed in the Chongqing area, with very few exceptions, were mostly arrogant, so they did not receive the benefits of the American Lend-Lease Act. Fifth, the United States spent heavily on constructing many air bases in the interior of China, but has not yet repaid a single cent. Sixth, the Americans residing in the Chongqing area are mostly arrogant and rude. From all these facts, one can imagine where the space for American friendship with China lies.</p>
<h3>Burmese Buddhist League Condemns Anglo-American Atrocities</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 19th (Central News Agency) - The inhumane behavior of the Anglo-American armies in Chongqing, who have massacred innocent people and destroyed and bombed hospitals, schools, and temples, is too numerous to list in this war. Currently, enemy troops in the northern part of Burma are destroying temples and civilian houses through guerrilla activities. Recently, an incident occurred near Myitkyina where a monk's robe was trampled, causing extreme indignation among the residents. The Burmese Buddhist League, in response to this atrocity, issued a directive on the 17th and held a united Buddhist support conference in Rangoon, passing three resolutions: The Chongqing-English-Americans are the enemies of Burma. When they fled from Burma in defeat, they destroyed Buddhist pagodas and religious buildings without leaving anything behind, and plundered objects from temples. Buddhists vow to fight them to the end. When the British ruled Burma, they used all kinds of cunning to promote Christianity, making Burmese people hostile to Buddhism. From now on, Burmese people vow to unite under the same faith. Regarding acts of destroying Buddhist pagodas and other sacred religious objects, this conference will collect and record this information and demand compensation for the losses when the war ends victoriously.</p>
<h3>Heavy Casualties on Chongqing-India Air Route</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - New York dispatch: Life magazine in its recent publication carried photographs of the Chongqing-India air route, explaining the heavy sacrifices suffered on the Chongqing-India air route. It is claimed that the Chongqing air route is no different from a route from the sky to hell, because the routes it passes through are all sparsely populated mountainous areas. The Chongqing government has always strictly prohibited the publication of information about the situation on this route, but in the past two years, the number of American Air Force personnel who died tragically on this air route is unknown. In this war, the sacrifices suffered on this air route are more than any other non-combat air route. At the same time, the losses of combat air units on this route are also considerable.</p>

On the night of August 9, the Japanese garrison in La Meng, with a raiding team, penetrated deep into the Chongqing army's positions, destroying two mountain guns, two mortars, and three heavy machine guns.</p>
<p>Central Pacific</p>
<p>In the area of the Mariana Islands, on Saipan and Tinian Islands, the land battles have lasted for two sentences. The Japanese garrison is concentrated in the southern part of the island to resist the enemy, launching fierce attacks on the American army and inflicting great damage. The Japanese side has also suffered some damage. In recent times, they have continued to fight fiercely in various locations. On the nights of the 15th, 16th, and 17th, they used enemy naval vessel flares to continue to fiercely attack the American army's positions. On Omiya Island, after more than two sentences of fierce fighting, the front line is still in a state of intense combat. The Japanese army in that area is overcoming various difficulties and continuing to fight tenaciously. As for the Marshall Islands, the American army has not taken any action in that area. Furthermore, in the Caroline Islands area, on the 13th, 23 American large aircraft attacked Truk.

<p>Japanese Army Sinks Enemy Ships off Sabang Island in the Indian Ocean</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific, Japanese Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) The British Indian Ocean Fleet attacked Sabang Island with a powerful naval force on the morning of July 25. The details have been released by the Japanese General Headquarters. The Japanese army's air defense units sank two enemy destroyers, one submarine, and severely damaged another destroyer, as well as shooting down several enemy aircraft. At 8:30 AM on the same morning, enemy aircraft suddenly appeared in the sky. Japanese army positions and naval units unleashed a fierce barrage of fire, causing several enemy aircraft to be hit and forced to retreat in disarray. Instantly, four enemy destroyers patrolling the sea approached the port of Sabang. The Japanese naval vessels launched torpedoes at them. The enemy adopted a close-quarters strategy, only causing slight damage to Japanese vessels. The enemy destroyers and the cruiser group anchored north of Sabang opened fire on the Japanese. Japanese artillery units and aircraft responded in kind. One enemy ship was hit with a large shell and began to list. Prior to this, the elite army's ground units had also prepared for enemy landings, responding with deadly fire to the enemy's heavy artillery bombardment. Although enemy aircraft attempted to observe the impact points, due to the enemy's poor artillery skills, not a single shell hit the Japanese army's positions. After the Japanese army's brave artillery fire, the enemy destroyers, whose stubborn counterattacks were losing momentum, gradually showed signs of distress. Japanese torpedo boats, like a whirlwind, broke into the enemy fleet and engaged in close combat with its first vessel. At the same time, artillery fire also began to bombard the enemy, and the stern of the ship was hit by a torpedo, causing the enemy fleet to split. The torpedoed enemy ship fled in panic, and the Japanese batteries opened fire, surrounding the enemy ship and causing it to sink. At this time, a staff officer shouted, "Sank one enemy ship!" Furthermore, Japanese aircraft discovered a large enemy submarine southwest of Sabang Island. The submarine surfaced to rescue downed aviators parachuting to the sea. Japanese aircraft bombed it, with the first bomb destroying the submarine's command structure and the second hitting its bow. The engagement lasted for one hour, with the enemy's naval guns firing for a total of forty-five minutes, which was extremely fierce. However, with the concerted efforts of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, the enemy ship was completely repelled.</p>

<h3>Forty-Three Flour Mills Have Started Production, and the Supply of Household Flour is Extremely Abundant</h3>

The total amount of wheat purchased in various cities and counties in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces has reached approximately one million bags, which have been transported to designated warehouses and entrusted to flour mills for processing. It is now known that the committee manages a total of forty-three flour mills in various regions of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, all of which have started production.

<h3>Several Opium Dens in Nanshi Secretly Operating</h3>
<p>After the authorities resolved to eradicate opium and gambling in Nanshi, the situation in the entire district has now returned to normal. It is now known that all gambling dens have been converted to other businesses, and the root cause of the gambling atmosphere has long been completely eliminated. However, the opium dens that were ordered to close have recently been secretly reopened. Some opium dens are secretly resuming business. It is hoped that the authorities will adhere to the principle of eradicating drugs completely and strictly prohibit them.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Oil Prices, Urgent Need to Curb It</h3>
<p>Household oil in this city will soon be distributed, but the price of cooking oil has suddenly risen sharply since the 18th. The general public is suffering an unbearable burden. Yesterday, reporters learned from relevant sources that the reason for the sharp increase in cooking oil prices is not only due to the 60% increase in the price of household oil distribution compared to before. It is due to transportation difficulties, reduced supply, reduced production by major oil mills in this city due to electricity rationing, and increased demand due to the use of vegetable oil for lighting by the general public and various entertainment venues, cafes, and hotels in this city after the implementation of the ban on electric lights after 11 PM. However, cooking oil is one of the most important necessities of life for citizens and is closely related to people's livelihood. It is hoped that the authorities will, on the one hand, curb illegal transactions by unscrupulous merchants and lower prices, and on the other hand, actively dredge the supply channels to ensure the distribution of household oil in each period to benefit people's livelihood. At the same time, citizens must conserve automatically.</p>
<h3>Vehicle Air Defense Equipment Inspection Extended for Five Days; Severe Penalties for Late Inspections</h3>

<p>Reader's Scholarship News</p>
<h3>People from All Walks of Life Continue to Donate; Mr. Luo Hongyi Has Raised 200,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The scholarship fund of this newspaper has recently received deep concern from people from all walks of life, and donations have continued. This makes the colleagues even more excited. Although sweating at work, there is still a residual sweetness! Yesterday, we received a letter from all the students of Chengyi Middle School, calling on all sectors of society for the poor and out-of-school children. The original letter said: "The holidays are coming to an end, and every happy student is busy preparing for school, full of infinite hope. However, those poor and out-of-school students, limited to watching them happy, what about themselves? Only sadness, hesitation, worry, and disappointment; no way to borrow, no way to beg, is it that the opportunity to study should disappear in fate? In the past few days, I have only seen the newspaper, one after another, the lament of out-of-school, the pleading of the unsuccessful, and the constant complaints, revealing endless sadness between the lines! We are in this situation, and no one can hold back tears of sympathy. Therefore, in the sweltering heat, we are running around to solicit donations, responding to the newspaper's scholarship donation campaign: and we will hold a charity performance of "Thunderstorm" at the Lanxin Theater on August 23 to thank all sectors of society. We have also added special honorary seats. Anyone who donates 1,000 yuan to the newspaper will receive one ticket. We beg all sectors of society to donate generously. Our performance is of course shallow and thin, not enough to watch. However, we are doing this to save those out-of-school students who are still wandering and waiting to be rescued. We beg</p>
<p>all sectors of society to embrace the universal kindness of "not only treating one's own children as children"</p>
<p>and open up your compassionate hearts,</p>
<p>and rescue them more! Chengyi Middle School</p>
<p>all the students beg to borrow a corner of the newspaper, to</p>
<p>call on all sectors of society!"</p>
<p>People from All Walks of Life Donate Generously</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Hongyi has</p>
<p>always</p>
<p>strongly</p>
<p>supported</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>scholarship fund of this</p>
<p>newspaper, and this year he has</p>
<p>again taken on the task of raising 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>His enthusiasm is particularly appreciated. Mr. Zhu Shouzhi, after</p>
<p>reading the previous plea in this newspaper</p>
<p>for the 3,000-plus failed students, was moved by a thought of kindness and specially sent Mr. Guo</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>request</p>
<p>to read the application forms of</p>
<p>unsuccessful high school and university students,</p>
<p>and examined them one by one,</p>
<p>selecting the five poorest high school and six university</p>
<p>students. He</p>
<p>approved</p>
<p>their applications</p>
<p>and Mr. Zhu generously donated</p>
<p>50,000 yuan to provide scholarships for the ten students.</p>
<p>Such</p>
<p>kindness</p>
<p>is admirable!</p>

<h3>Announcement from the Propaganda Department: Drama Censorship Rules</h3>

<h3>The Eyes of a Bat</h3>
<p>— by Tōyū Yoshida</p>
<p>In the summer evenings, bats fly around "squeaking". The Chinese consider them auspicious animals,</p>
<p>because the pronunciation of the words "bat" and "fortune" in Chinese are the same. The two characters for "bat" do not have the dog radical,</p>
<p>but the insect radical, truly befitting of this pitiable animal. When people mention them, they fearfully</p>
<p>peek with their small eyes—so small that they cannot be seen without a microscope—amongst the velvet-like soft fur.</p>
<p>Perhaps everyone has doubted it once: how can such small eyes fly swiftly and catch mosquitoes</p>
<p>in such a dark sky? To answer this question, a German</p>
<p>zoologist came up with an experimental method. He strung thin threads</p>
<p>horizontally and vertically in a dark room, punctured the bat's eyes with needles, and released it. But strangely, even though the blinded bat flew</p>
<p>horizontally, vertically, and up and down in the dark room, it never touched the thin threads. Therefore, he believed that bats must have some other very sensitive sense besides their eyes. So, based on this assumption, he continued to bury</p>
<p>himself in research, and as a result, he discovered that the nerves within the bat's skin are very developed. Even a slight change in air vibration can be felt during flight, and it is dodged</p>
<p>accordingly. In this view, the entire body of the bat</p>
<p>is limited like a large eye. The bat is just like a master of Japanese Kendo, who can feel the wind caused by a sword being slashed from behind, and thus skillfully dodges it and escapes danger. The animal that possesses this kind of keen sensitivity is the bat. Some ignorant people, without understanding the "divine intention in creating things" which bestows the ability to survive upon individual</p>
<p>creatures, only see the bat's small eyes, and then</p>
<p>mock its poor eyesight and difficulty in moving.</p>
<p>I believe that many "Sinologists"</p>
<p>who previously ridiculed the Chinese</p>
<p>for being foolish have made the same mistake as those who mock "the eyes of a bat."</p>
<p>According to foreign perspectives, the general knowledge level of Chinese people is very low. It is doubtful</p>
<p>whether such a nation has spirit. The famous Sinologist Arthur</p>
<p>H. Smith (an American missionary) once</p>
<p>judged the characteristic of the Chinese to be</p>
<p>"intellectual turbidity." He</p>
<p>explained:</p>
<p>"The difference between intelligence and ignorance, wealth and poverty, is the most extreme in China.</p>
<p>The super-rich and the abjectly poor, the highly educated and the illiterate, such polar opposites,</p>
<p>live on the same land. Countless millions of impoverished</p>
<p>and ignorant people have such narrow horizons</p>
<p>that their minds, whether subjectively willing or</p>
<p>not, are deeply mired in 'intellectual confusion.'</p>
<p>They are indeed frogs in a well. They have never traveled</p>
<p>ten miles from their birthplace. They know nothing</p>
<p>about the lives of people outside of those around them.</p>
<p>The instinctual curiosity that is common to all peoples seems</p>
<p>to have hibernated or become fatigued in most of these people.</p>
<p>Many Chinese, even if they know that foreigners have come to live within a mile</p>
<p>of their homes, never want</p>
<p>to ask where the foreigner came from, what their name is,</p>
<p>or what their intentions are. They certainly</p>
<p>know how to fight for survival, but know nothing else besides that. They have no idea</p>
<p>whether the soul that most people believe in</p>
<p>has three, one, or none.</p>
<p>They consider such things, which have nothing to do with the price of the five grains, to be impractical</p>
<p>theories. They...are what Westerners call 'pragmatists,'</p>
<p>that is, their lives are simply</p>
<p>composed of the pleasures of the palate and the purse. This is the result of the extremely active human power</p>
<p>, and therefore they are materialists. They understand nothing</p>
<p>except what they see and hear with their own eyes and ears, and they have absolutely no</p>
<p>notions of idealism or anything like that. They think of life as a series of facts, and also a series of painful</p>
<p>facts. If they transcend facts, then they are also atheists, also theists, and also</p>
<p>agnostics. Although they sometimes kneel and pray, they do not know</p>
<p>to whom they are kneeling and praying. Although they offer sacrifices, they do not know</p>
<p>to whom they are offering sacrifices. Their</p>
<p>only purpose is to satisfy their religious</p>
<p>instincts, and they do not care about anything else."</p>
<p>However, the Chinese who possess this seemingly</p>
<p>intellectually confused state had not received guidance from the government before 1937. Naturally, they were also not particularly</p>
<p>aware that Shanghai would become a battlefield based on the analysis of the world situation.</p>
<p>Therefore, most of them moved away from the Hongkou district. On the surface, the lives of these Chinese, who seem to be composed of the simple "pleasures of the palate and the purse,"</p>
<p>have continued to maintain the world's</p>
<p>oldest culture to this day, and in this world</p>
<p>where the competition for survival is the most intense, they will in some sense become a new world-class power.</p>
<p>Seeing this fact, the Chinese definitely have an instinctual</p>
<p>awareness that we do not understand. This is just like how bats use the sensation of their skin instead of their eyes to see things. The Chinese perhaps perceive things using a special sense that is completely different from what we call "reason."</p>
<p>But then, what exactly is this sense itself?</p>
<p>Confucius once said to Zigong:</p>
<p>"Be a gentleman and not a petty man." Gu Hongming explained this sentence by saying: "If you want to be a great scholar, don't forget to become a gentleman with sensibility. In order to be a great scholar, don't be a foolish person." Here, Confucius emphasized possessing</p>
<p>knowledge with sensibility, rather than mere knowledge.</p>
<p>Knowledge with sensibility is not knowledge that can be known simply from books, but is knowledge that is dissolved into one's own life and has a real sense. It is this point that, once known, gives knowledge that seems so impossible to be non-impulsive. That is to say,</p>
<p>Confucius often emphasized knowledge with emotion, that is, knowledge accompanied by practice. Confucius said, "The gentleman wishes to be slow in his words, but diligent in his actions," and also said, "The superior man is ashamed of his words exceeding his deeds." Confucius even told</p>
<p>his disciple Zilu, who was a man of action, that "If you have heard something but have not been able to put it into practice, then you should fear hearing it again." When externally given knowledge is combined with internal experience, it then has a real sense. When one experience in the mind</p>
<p>contradicts another experience, then a person has doubts. A person wants to explain this doubt, and then becomes troubled. This is the relationship that seeks knowledge. At this time, if the teacher gives knowledge with appropriate explanations, then the two previously contradictory experiences in the mind are reconciled and consistent. Then one obtains the knowledge of the true sense that is combined with experience. Confucius</p>
<p>valued this rational kind of vexation when acquiring knowledge with a real sense.</p>
<p>Therefore, Confucius said, "If one does not say, 'What shall I do? What shall I do?' I can really do nothing with him!" and in another place said, "To learn without thinking is labor lost; to think without learning is perilous." The "thinking" mentioned here is the vexation of knowledge that I am talking about. Confucius certainly said at first, "Thinking is of no value; learning is better," but pure learning is absolutely not sufficient. If knowledge vexation does not occur at the same time as learning, then knowledge will not become something with a real sense; that is, it will become what Confucius called "bewilderment." Conversely, if there is merely knowledge vexation without learning, then there will be no progress; that is, one will fall into what Confucius called "peril." Therefore, Confucius often emphasized to the Chinese knowledge with a real sense and a mind with sensibility. A mind without sensibility is what the Germans call a "stone head" (Stein Kopf), which can best express sensible knowledge or knowledge with a real sense. The most concrete expression of sensible knowledge or knowledge with a real sense is the knowledge of children. What children know is also real to them at the same time. The reason why children know about ghosts and monsters is because they believe that ghosts and monsters actually threaten them. Gu Hongming's saying that the Chinese are a people with a "child's psychology" also refers to this point.</p>
<p>Based on this perspective, Hongming</p>
<p>explains the Chinese as follows:</p>
<p>"The Chinese to this day</p>
<p>lead a child's life, a life of the heart.</p>
<p>(A life of the heart). Therefore, in terms of nationhood,</p>
<p>the Chinese are certainly an ancient nation, but</p>
<p>to this day they are still a childish nation.</p>
<p>But what is especially important is that this childish nation, which leads</p>
<p>a life of the heart, has many</p>
<p>primitive forms in its practical life, but</p>
<p>has the mental power and rationality that primitive nations cannot have.</p>
<p>(A power of mind and rationality).</p>
<p>Under the guidance of this mental power and rationality, the Chinese</p>
<p>can smoothly solve the difficult and complex problems</p>
<p>of social life, government, and civilization...</p>
<p>What I especially want to</p>
<p>point out here is that the admirable characteristic</p>
<p>of the Chinese is actually not</p>
<p>that the Chinese simply lead a life of the heart,</p>
<p>because all primitive nations also</p>
<p>lead a life of the heart. At the same time, as far as</p>
<p>I know, the European Christians of the Middle Ages also</p>
<p>lived a life of the heart.</p>
<p>Matthew Arnold said: 'The poetry of medieval Christianity</p>
<p>is formed by the heart and imagination.'</p>
<p>However, what I especially want to point out is that the admirable characteristic of the Chinese</p>
<p>is that the Chinese both</p>
<p>lead a life of the heart and a life of childhood, while also holding</p>
<p>the mental power and rationality that medieval Christians and other primitive</p>
<p>nations do not have.</p>
<p>In other words, the amazing characteristic of the Chinese</p>
<p>is that they are a grown-up nation,</p>
<p>a rationally mature nation, and a nation with such a long history,</p>
<p>but they still lead a life of the heart and a life of childhood to this day.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people say that China is a nation that has stopped growing and developing, but</p>
<p>in reality, the Chinese are definitely not</p>
<p>becoming an aging nation. In short, the amazing characteristic of the</p>
<p>Chinese nation is that its people know the secret of permanently maintaining youth."</p>
<p>What was pointed out earlier by Arthur</p>
<p>H. Smith, as well as many other foreigners,</p>
<p>that cannot be discovered in China— precisely because it cannot be discovered, and</p>
<p>they completely cannot understand the Chinese and</p>
<p>their culture— to be honest,</p>
<p>this is the characteristic of the Chinese.</p>
<p>To repeat, the Chinese are "</p>
<p>a people with the minds of adults and the psychology of children." This means that</p>
<p>the Chinese are a people who understand things with their minds,</p>
<p>and perceive things with their emotions.</p>
<p>The Chinese's perception is just like</p>
<p>children perceive adults they like and</p>
<p>adults they dislike at a glance.</p>
<p>This is not by reasoning,</p>
<p>but by the power of "sensibility." Therefore,</p>
<p>the Chinese cannot be said to be a people with sharp</p>
<p>"sensibility." Arthur H. Smith says that the Chinese's way of thinking</p>
<p>lacks exactness (Want of exactness). This may be true, but the Chinese</p>
<p>are a people who think more with their hearts than with their heads.</p>
<p>As for the heart, let us use Gu Hongming's</p>
<p>words again: "It is</p>
<p>a very sensitive and delicate organ.</p>
<p>It is not a solid and strict machine like the brain. Therefore, the heart's</p>
<p>thinking cannot be as accurate as the brain's thinking.</p>
<p>If saying this is wrong, then at the very least it can be said</p>
<p>that it is extremely difficult for the heart to think correctly.</p>
<p>What the Chinese use for writing is not a fountain pen or a pencil,</p>
<p>but a writing brush. But it can also be said</p>
<p>that only the writing brush is a symbol of the Chinese heart.</p>
<p>It is certainly very difficult to write and paint with a writing brush,</p>
<p>but once one is proficient in its use, it can express</p>
<p>beauty and charm that a fountain pen cannot express."</p>
<p>In the Chinese language, there has never been a term</p>
<p>equal to logic. Logic may be something that must be thought with the head, but for</p>
<p>the Chinese who think with their hearts, it is not entirely</p>
<p>necessary. Those who think with their hearts do not use logic as a weapon, but</p>
<p>use the delicacy of emotion and the</p>
<p>sensitivity as weapons. Just like the bats with such small</p>
<p>eyes possess the mysterious sense of being able to fly and catch small mosquitoes in the dark sky, the Chinese</p>
<p>have the agile sensitivity and refinement of the heart, through which they have been able to pass through the world's fierce survival</p>
<p>competition process for five thousand years. This is a great</p>
<p>achievement.</p>
<p>Many foreigners have overlooked this</p>
<p>step, so they think that the Chinese are a people with weak thinking power and are easily deceived. Since the late Qing Dynasty, when the Chinese</p>
<p>longed for the modernization of their country,</p>
<p>foreigners all rushed forward—even arguing— wanting to help</p>
<p>China modernize. Some lent funds for</p>
<p>railway construction, some established</p>
<p>churches, opened hospitals, some established</p>
<p>schools to educate Chinese children, and so on.</p>
<p>All of this was necessary for China's modernization.</p>
<p>Foreigners say that the Chinese should express their gratitude</p>
<p>to them for these many forms of assistance. However,</p>
<p>the Chinese, who do not think with their heads but with their hearts, have been extremely astute observers. As Arthur H. Smith admitted,</p>
<p>"The Chinese only firmly believe that they</p>
<p>themselves want to reform the Chinese Empire, and</p>
<p>do not recognize that the great powers' reforms of China</p>
<p>are driven by higher ideals."</p>
<p>The Chinese, here too, have reached the same conclusion</p>
<p>that accurate thinking can reach due to their sharp</p>
<p>sensibility. The Chinese certainly cannot accurately</p>
<p>know that the foreigners' assistance will</p>
<p>result in China becoming "meat on the chopping block,"</p>
<p>but they can accurately sense this little by little.</p>
<p>To this point, I would like to make a conclusion.</p>
<p>Currently, Japan is recognizing the freedom, independence, and equality of China.</p>
<p>The concept of the Japanese government recognizing the freedom, independence, and equality of China</p>
<p>means that individual Japanese people must recognize that individual Chinese people are the people of an equal</p>
<p>and independent nation. As for whether</p>
<p>individual Japanese people sincerely and earnestly think this way</p>
<p>and whether there is sincerity in this national policy,</p>
<p>the Chinese with strong sensibility can immediately</p>
<p>sense it with their hearts. The "benevolence" (ren) in Confucius' saying that "clever words and a flattering appearance are seldom associated with true benevolence"</p>
<p>refers to sincerity in human relationships. Clever words and a flattering appearance without sincerity</p>
<p>cannot get through with the Chinese.</p>
<p>The other day, I published</p>
<p>an article in the Shen Bao entitled "Making a Big Deal out of a Small Issue,"</p>
<p>and pointed out a certain mistaken notion of the Japanese. Then, someone dogmatically questioned me, saying: "Family matters should not be aired in public. Why don't you conceal the Japanese people's wrongdoing towards the Chinese and instead publish it to the Chinese?" But I believe: Why</p>
<p>can we only sing the praises of the Japanese people</p>
<p>to the Chinese, with whom we have sworn to live and die together,</p>
<p>and not expose the Japanese people's arrogance?</p>
<p>Every Japanese person still needs to ask themselves in the quiet of the night, whether they are maintaining</p>
<p>what degree of faithfulness to the slogan of "living and dying together."</p>
<p>This is the idea that "the superior man is ashamed of his words exceeding his deeds." A gentleman also has times when his "words" exceed his "deeds."</p>
<p>We have long since made our "words," but now the problem lies in</p>
<p>how to make our "deeds" catch up with our "words."</p>
<p>I have no doubt that if every Japanese person</p>
<p>can have this kind of self-reflection in practice, then</p>
<p>the hearts of the Chinese with strong sensibility will definitely</p>
<p>sensitively sense this. Because</p>
<p>the Chinese do not want to hear</p>
<p>the grand and magnificent Great East Asia theory made by the Japanese,</p>
<p>but want to feel with their hearts the sincerity that is expressed in practice. (Translated by Lu)</p>

<h3>Heartstrings Whispers</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yifan</p>
<p>Dedicated to Xin</p>
<p>Yesterday you came to my place, saw that slip of paper pressed under my glass cup, and couldn't help but smile. I asked you what you were smiling at, and you just glared at me without answering. Leaning against the table, your two eyes wide, you gazed at the white clouds outside the window, lost in thought. The room was so quiet that we could hear each other's heartbeats. I quietly walked up from behind, grabbed your hand, and held it tightly. You immediately struggled free, a blush rising on your face, and fled to the window like a bird. The sunlight poured over you, and in the glow of the sunset, you looked even more beautiful and charming.</p>
<p>"How are you now?" you asked, turning your face to me.</p>
<p>"Jumping out of the love trap, breaking free from economic control, that is a celestial being in heaven, a living Buddha on earth." This slip of paper was clipped from a magazine. I had even specially added a few words myself: "I am very self-aware. Although I am poor, I am not so poor as to be controlled by economics. As for love, I am well aware of my insufficient conditions and dare not venture in rashly. Since I haven't entered the door, naturally there is no need to jump out." So my life before was as calm as stagnant water. Although I occasionally felt bored, I still managed to get through it safely. But since you stepped into my circle of life, I can no longer suppress my feelings. You threw a small stone into my life, and the calm water surface immediately rippled.</p>
<p>"How are you now?"</p>
<p>I knew you were asking me on purpose, with a playful smile, like a spring flower basking in the warm sunshine. You asked so abruptly that I was stunned. What should I answer you? Today, as I pondered alone, I came up with an answer:</p>
<p>"I am human! How do you expect me to jump out?"</p>
<p>One night,</p>
<p>we came out</p>
<p>from watching a play,</p>
<p>I walked you</p>
<p>home, walking</p>
<p>under the gray-yellow lamplight, our two shadows stretched long. The autumn wind blew, and we felt a chill. You leaned very close to me, but neither of us spoke. However, our two hearts were already melting together. I suddenly asked you:</p>
<p>"Will you always be by my side?"</p>
<p>Although it was just a soft question, it broke the silence. You didn't answer me, and the air around us solidified again. Only the phoenix tree leaves trembled in the autumn wind, rustling. After a while, you said:</p>
<p>"You don't believe it?"</p>
<p>I wanted to say something, but you were already home.</p>
<p>To tell</p>
<p>the truth, I</p>
<p>don't quite</p>
<p>believe it.</p>
<p>It's not that I doubt you, but I'm afraid that I have no future and will ruin you. In terms of your beauty and education, I am too far apart. I have never worn a square hat and have been mixing in society for many years, with nothing but empty hands. I will never make big money or get rich. I feel it is wrong and almost cruel to get so close to you. So sometimes, although my heart wants to stand closer to you, I remember, "Don't ruin her!" My heart immediately sinks. Lately, even the courage to ask you to go to the theater together has disappeared. Speaking of going to the theater, last month we went to see "Six Records of a Floating Life." The protagonist, Luo Tuo, has a detached personality, is not good at managing things, and does not value money or possessions. Although Yun is a gentle and considerate woman, the joy of conjugal life is greatly reduced when they lack rice and firewood. Their lives are full of hardship, and their old age is even more miserable, enduring the torment of life in hunger and cold. Isn't such a tragic experience enough to warn me? This story deeply wounded my heart. Walking out of the theater, the tear stains seemed not yet dry. I wanted to tell you directly, "Let me stay away from you!" In fact, that is the only way for you to be happy. But somehow, I couldn't bring myself to say it.</p>
<p>You are a young</p>
<p>lady growing</p>
<p>up in Shanghai.</p>
<p>I think you</p>
<p>must be well</p>
<p>aware of the environment in Shanghai. You know that Shanghai has become more and more extravagant in recent years. Everyone has a greedy desire for material pleasures. I don't underestimate you, but I don't regard you as a superhuman, thinking that there is not even a hint of vanity or ambition in you. In fact, are you really wrong? The one who is wrong is me. I think if I had money in my hands, wouldn't everything be okay? It's just a pity that I lack money. This problem will naturally not be serious during courtship. Even if our pockets are empty today, we don't have to go to the cinema or other expensive places. We can wander on the streets for half a day and still feel deeply in love without feeling tired. But we can't just focus on the present, right? Many tragedies are caused by thinking too little about the future. If we close our eyes and imagine, our stomachs empty, our bodies cold, how will we spend our days? The tragedy in "Six Records of a Floating Life" should be a good comparison.</p>
<p>You still seem young and innocent, and your family environment is not bad, so you can't imagine these things at all, or perhaps you wouldn't understand even if I told you. Today I don't intend to write about it here. I'm afraid you'll misunderstand and hurt your heart, but this is indeed what I've been holding in my heart for months.</p>
<p>Today you still came</p>
<p>to my place.</p>
<p>I didn't greet</p>
<p>you as warmly</p>
<p>as before. I want to stay away from you. You might be unhappy. Your expression didn't look very good, but this is fortunate for you.</p>
<p>You will understand what I mean, won't you?</p>
<h3>Childhood Memories: Fragments of a Childhood Life</h3>
<p>— Hu Yi</p>
<p>"Spring goes and autumn comes. The wandering son is saddened by his drifting life. When I recall my brother, the scenes seem like yesterday..." As I slowly and softly recited this poem, I happened to glimpse that the weeping willows outside the window had sprouted tender green buds at some point. It seemed that the Creator was indicating that it was now the season of red peach blossoms and yellow rapeseed flowers again.</p>
<p>The past is worth savoring. Every time I reach this season, I can't help but recall a touching story from my childhood!</p>
<p>It was probably the year I turned six!</p>
<p>It was also a spring</p>
<p>day with a gentle breeze and</p>
<p>bright sunshine. My younger sister and I were sent by</p>
<p>our mother to our grandfather's</p>
<p>house in our hometown, because we wanted a change of environment.</p>
<p>Because we had never</p>
<p>lived with our grandfather,</p>
<p>we were very unfamiliar and distant from him. You could say</p>
<p>that we didn't know him at all.</p>
<p>The first time we saw him, my</p>
<p>mother took my little hand, walked up to him,</p>
<p>and told me to call him "Grandpa."</p>
<p>At that time, I opened my eyes wide,</p>
<p>staring blankly at him, feeling</p>
<p>everything was strange and fearful.</p>
<p>My grandfather smiled</p>
<p>broadly, picked me up and</p>
<p>sat me on his knee.</p>
<p>His dry hands stroked</p>
<p>my cheeks, and he asked me very</p>
<p>concerned:</p>
<p>"Big baby, are you</p>
<p>tired? Are you tired at all?"</p>
<p>This gentle and</p>
<p>loving voice echoed in my ears.</p>
<p>I, who usually didn't like calling people,</p>
<p>actually obediently said to him:</p>
<p>"Grandpa! I'm a little hungry."</p>
<p>He was very happy to hear me speak,</p>
<p>looked up at my mother, and said</p>
<p>very proudly, as if praising:</p>
<p>"This child is so clever!" As he spoke,</p>
<p>he picked me up and took me</p>
<p>to get some cake to eat. Although it was</p>
<p>the first time I met my grandfather, he</p>
<p>gave me a deep and loving impression.</p>
<p>My grandfather's love for us can be said</p>
<p>to be meticulous. Every morning, he</p>
<p>personally went to the market, and came</p>
<p>back carrying a basket full of things we loved</p>
<p>to eat: big prawns, live</p>
<p>crucian carp, as well as fat chickens, eggs,</p>
<p>and tender green bamboo shoots.</p>
<p>And—there were so many delicious things!</p>
<p>My grandfather not only paid attention to our</p>
<p>diet, but also cared about our</p>
<p>health. He wanted our lives to be</p>
<p>regular. He would wake us up</p>
<p>every day before the sun even rose,</p>
<p>helped us with washing up, eat</p>
<p>snacks, and take our hands to</p>
<p>the back garden to watch the sunrise. At that time, he</p>
<p>told us where the sun rose</p>
<p>from and where it set, and pointed to the</p>
<p>ever-changing morning glow, asking us to</p>
<p>distinguish its colors. I remember that</p>
<p>at that time my sister often confused purple and blue.</p>
<p>It's really funny when I think about it now.</p>
<p>The setting sun dragged its weary steps,</p>
<p>slowly rolling down the mountain, and the breeze carried</p>
<p>a hint of coolness. The sky was scattered</p>
<p>with blood-red evening clouds.</p>
<p>In the embrace of that beautiful, book-like</p>
<p>nature, my grandfather took</p>
<p>my sister and me, strolling slowly along the</p>
<p>stream. Along the way, he told us</p>
<p>about farming knowledge and interesting</p>
<p>stories. Sometimes he would squat on the</p>
<p>path in the fields, pick some green</p>
<p>grass, and tell us that it was alfalfa,</p>
<p>or point to a pile of dark</p>
<p>little animals in the river, telling us that</p>
<p>they were tadpoles. The afterglow of the setting sun gradually</p>
<p>disappeared as we talked and walked.</p>
<p>In addition to strolling twice a day,</p>
<p>he instructed the family not to</p>
<p>let the two children run out of the</p>
<p>gate, because there were many stray dogs in the countryside,</p>
<p>and there were small rivers winding everywhere.</p>
<p>The children were always worried</p>
<p>without adults.</p>
<p>One afternoon, the weather was exceptionally</p>
<p>clear, and the sun was particularly</p>
<p>warm. My grandfather had been</p>
<p>invited to a neighbor's house for dinner in the morning. My grandmother and aunt</p>
<p>were busy making glutinous rice balls in the kitchen.</p>
<p>At that time, my sister and I were playing</p>
<p>upstairs, feeling very lonely and bored.</p>
<p>There were several pairs of</p>
<p>small birds on the willow branches outside the window, chirping</p>
<p>and chattering non-stop.</p>
<p>We were attracted by this clear</p>
<p>and pleasant sound, and we unanimously</p>
<p>climbed onto a table by the window,</p>
<p>eagerly staring at those fearless</p>
<p>little birds. Suddenly, my</p>
<p>sister pulled my skirt.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" I turned</p>
<p>around and asked her.</p>
<p>"Sister! Look!" My</p>
<p>sister extended a finger, smiling</p>
<p>and softly answering. I followed the</p>
<p>direction she was pointing, and saw four or five</p>
<p>girls of our age</p>
<p>playing by the bridge in the field.</p>
<p>One was squatting on the ground, two were standing</p>
<p>next to her, watching the water, and</p>
<p>several others were clapping their hands and jumping. A burst</p>
<p>of silver bell-like laughter traveled to</p>
<p>my ears on the wind. I was so happy that I couldn't help but</p>
<p>open my mouth and laugh with them.</p>
<p>"Sister!" My sister pulled me</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>"What!" I was a little distracted,</p>
<p>my full attention turned to the</p>
<p>bridge.</p>
<p>"Shall we go over there?"</p>
<p>My sister drew closer to my ear</p>
<p>and asked timidly.</p>
<p>"Okay!...No, if Grandpa</p>
<p>knows..."</p>
<p>"Grandpa's not home!</p>
<p>Let's sneak out quietly, and come back in a little</p>
<p>while!" My sister confidently</p>
<p>offered her plan. My heart was</p>
<p>moved, and we both climbed down from the table,</p>
<p>tiptoed down the stairs, walked out of</p>
<p>the gate, and ran straight to the bridge.</p>
<p>Looking closely, it turned out</p>
<p>that the girl squatting on the ground</p>
<p>was the oldest one, who everyone called</p>
<p>Sister Qing. We also followed suit. Her hand</p>
<p>held a fishing net, and there</p>
<p>was a big fish jumping in the net.</p>
<p>The four children next to her were all so happy</p>
<p>that they danced. Sister Qing used skillful</p>
<p>movements to lower the bamboo pole,</p>
<p>and reached into the net with her other hand to take out the fish,</p>
<p>taking out at least one at a time. Before long, the wooden</p>
<p>bucket was already filled with three or four fish. Just as</p>
<p>we were enjoying the scene, my sister pulled</p>
<p>my skirt again:</p>
<p>"Sister, let's go back!"</p>
<p>"Wait a little longer, what's the rush!"</p>
<p>I was a little reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>Sister Qing was casting the net again and again,</p>
<p>and the bucket was almost full.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she shouted, "Look!"</p>
<p>As she spoke, she used force to lift the net.</p>
<p>I thought: this fish must be especially</p>
<p>big, and I couldn't help but be happy for her.</p>
<p>She reached out with a smile to grab the fish.</p>
<p>Probably because the fish was too big, she</p>
<p>couldn't hold back the fish's</p>
<p>jump with one small hand, and it slipped</p>
<p>out of her hand. At that time, my sister happened to be standing next to her, and the big fish happened to jump onto my sister's</p>
<p>face. My sister was startled</p>
<p>and took two steps back. Who knew there was</p>
<p>a small stream behind her. My sister slipped</p>
<p>and fell into the water.</p>
<p>The group of smiling children</p>
<p>were instantly frightened and dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Sister Qing was older than us</p>
<p>after all, and she regained her senses. She quickly stood</p>
<p>up and told everyone to go down the stone steps</p>
<p>and pull my sister up. Fortunately, the</p>
<p>water there was shallow, so she didn't drown, but</p>
<p>she was covered in mud.</p>
<p>My sister looked at me with a crying and laughing</p>
<p>expression. As for me,</p>
<p>I was so scared that I was speechless,</p>
<p>watching them pull my sister up,</p>
<p>wipe the mud off her face and body, but</p>
<p>I was too scared to say a word.</p>
<p>My grandfather didn't allow us to run around by ourselves,</p>
<p>for fear that children would be curious</p>
<p>and like to take risks, which could easily lead to accidents.</p>
<p>This was his experience!</p>

<p>Sports</p>
<h3>Summer Swimming Sports</h3>
<p>Swimming, as a sport in Shanghai, has always seemed to be primarily for entertainment, rarely producing good results, and this is mainly due to the environment. However, the general athletes of Guangdong and Hong Kong, two aquatic regions, benefit from the climate, so talents have emerged throughout history. I still remember that in the 6th National Games aquatic competitions, regardless of men's or women's championships, they were all seized by the Guangdong team, whose talents were average. Hong Kong relied on outstanding individuals such as Chen Zhenxing and Yang Xiuqiong to win the men's and women's individual championships. Among them, the beauty and grace of the mermaid Yang Xiuqiong swept the entire society, while on the men's side in Shanghai, only Liang Weisheng and Shi Bogen barely managed to win a few points. Although there were six women participating on the women's side, they all failed to win any medals, which is enough to prove Shanghai's lack of attention to this sport.</p>
<p>This summer, Shanghai has very few opportunities to practice swimming</p>
<p>This summer, the only</p>
<p>swimming pool in Shanghai open to the public</p>
<p>is the Hongkou Swimming Pool.</p>
<p>Because of this, the pool is even</p>
<p>more crowded every day, with only</p>
<p>the atmosphere of just soaking</p>
<p>in the water. And apart from</p>
<p>the China Youth once having a</p>
<p>non-official scrimmage, no other</p>
<p>competitions have been held,</p>
<p>which is regrettable. I have learned that the</p>
<p>Municipal Sports Association will hold the Chinese Open</p>
<p>Swimming Competition on the 30th of this month at the</p>
<p>East Asia Gymnasium Swimming Pool. The news</p>
<p>is quite exciting. However, the pool room</p>
<p>in the pavilion is narrow and cannot accommodate many spectators,</p>
<p>which is a shortcoming. And this competition</p>
<p>will be the only official competition</p>
<p>this season.</p>
<p>The Chinese Open Competition will be held on the 30th of this month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Sports Association</p>
<p>organized the 33rd Annual China-Eight Swimming Championship</p>
<p>Competition. The venue is the East Asia</p>
<p>Gymnasium Swimming Pool on Jing'an Temple Road. Registration</p>
<p>is open from the 16th to the 26th of this month.</p>
<p>The registration fee is 50 yuan per person, along with</p>
<p>a deposit of 200 yuan. Those who participate in the</p>
<p>competition will have their deposit returned, otherwise</p>
<p>it will be confiscated. The registration office is at 749 Jing'an Temple Road</p>
<p>(Jing'an Building), Room 306. The competition date is the 30th of this month.</p>
<p>Each athlete can participate in a maximum of</p>
<p>three events (excluding diving), and four participants will be selected for each item.</p>
<p>Scoring is based on 5.3.2.1.,</p>
<p>and the top three will be awarded gold, silver, and bronze medals.</p>
<p>Divided into men's and women's groups, the one with</p>
<p>the most total points in each group will be the individual champion of that group.</p>
<p>Each will be awarded a silver shield. The competition</p>
<p>items are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Men's Group: 50-yard</p>
<p>Freestyle, 100-yard Freestyle,</p>
<p>400-yard Freestyle, 100-yard</p>
<p>Backstroke, 200-yard Breaststroke,</p>
<p>Fancy Diving.</p>
<p>Women's Group: 50-yard</p>
<p>Freestyle, 50-yard Backstroke,</p>
<p>100-yard Freestyle, 100-yard Breaststroke.</p>
<p>There are many enthusiasts in Shanghai, and it is</p>
<p>expected that registrants will be enthusiastic, so the</p>
<p>results will surely be wonderful, and the grand occasion can</p>
<p>be predicted.</p>
<p>The Sino-French Friendship Match was Extremely Heated</p>
<p>The Sino-French Friendship</p>
<p>Competition between the China Youth Association's</p>
<p>China Youth Swimming Team and the French Association</p>
<p>was held on August 11th at 5:30 PM</p>
<p>at the Sichuan Road China Youth Swimming Pool.</p>
<p>No tickets were sold, and entry was by invitation. The audience</p>
<p>filled the room, and the atmosphere was unusually lively.</p>
<p>The green water in the pool was</p>
<p>crystal clear, and the swimming was in progress,</p>
<p>making one feel refreshed.</p>
<p>Many experts joined this time.</p>
<p>The Chinese included Wen Jingling, Wang Zhongcheng, and Yang Enshou,</p>
<p>while the French had H. Balaran and Li Aoni,</p>
<p>all of whom are currently famous masters in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The referee was Mr. Jie Zhaoan, and the secretary was Mr. Chen Baolin.</p>
<p>The competition began at 5:30, and</p>
<p>each swimming hero competed fiercely</p>
<p>amidst the warm applause of the audience.</p>
<p>The French Association</p>
<p>won the first victory. H. Balaran's performance was outstanding,</p>
<p>winning both the 60-yard freestyle and</p>
<p>100-yard freestyle championships. Wen Weiling</p>
<p>finished fourth in the 100-yard freestyle,</p>
<p>and the 400-yard freestyle was also defeated by the Frenchman Li Aoni.</p>
<p>As for Wang Zhongcheng winning the 100-yard backstroke championship, Yang Enshou</p>
<p>won the 200-yard breaststroke championship, winning</p>
<p>thunderous applause from the entire audience, bringing</p>
<p>glory to the Chinese. There were a total of three relay races.</p>
<p>The China Youth team won the 160-yard breaststroke relay and the 120-yard medley relay. However, the French Association</p>
<p>won the final 160-yard four-person freestyle relay.</p>
<p>The champion of fancy diving was Wang Anxiang of the China Youth team, and the runner-up was Qi Nanyang.</p>
<p>The performance of Wang and Qi was exceptionally brilliant.</p>
<p>The French Association's Mai Aoli was left behind, sighing</p>
<p>that he was inferior. In addition to the various competitions, there were also various ancient swimming and modern swimming performances. The final result of the competition</p>
<p>was that the China Youth team won with 62 points to 55.</p>
<h3>Star Team Leader Zhou Wenji Talks About Basketball Tactics</h3>
<p>— Jie Mei</p>
<p>Miss Zhou</p>
<p>Wenji, the director</p>
<p>of the Star</p>
<p>Perfume Factory,</p>
<p>is shrewd and capable,</p>
<p>and has long been</p>
<p>renowned in the</p>
<p>industrial world.</p>
<p>The Star Basketball</p>
<p>Team is organized</p>
<p>by the factory's colleagues, with Zhou serving as the team leader.</p>
<p>Therefore, it has repeatedly overcome strong enemies and achieved remarkable results.</p>
<p>Recently, the Beiping Sports Friends Team went south</p>
<p>to fight. Although the main players were absent, they unfortunately</p>
<p>failed. However, their unrelenting spirit is commendable. The reporter</p>
<p>was sent to Shanghai to investigate the matter. Zhou</p>
<p>spoke eloquently and</p>
<p>insightfully, as recorded below:</p>
<p>"The Sports Friends Team won the first</p>
<p>three of the four matches in Shanghai, but lost to</p>
<p>Hualian in the last one. In terms of individual skills</p>
<p>, the Sports Friends Team and the Hualian Team</p>
<p>are comparable. Guo Yaochen and Guo Yongen's</p>
<p>dribbling is fast and agile, and Chang Ying's shooting</p>
<p>is accurate and beautiful. However, their tactics</p>
<p>are rigid and easily exploited,</p>
<p>unlike Hualian's ability to adapt to changes. The players</p>
<p>of Hualian are well-trained and can use their intelligence</p>
<p>to win. They are calm in the face of battle and never</p>
<p>get flustered. When Sports Friends meets them, they have a feeling</p>
<p>of 'unfathomable depth.' The outcome</p>
<p>is determined by this. Nowadays, basketball competitions</p>
<p>have progressed to the stage of 'battle of wits.'</p>
<p>Success depends on surprising and ingenious tactics.</p>
<p>Showy techniques can win applause, but are of no practical use.</p>
<p>This time, the Sports Friends Team came to Shanghai, making</p>
<p>us believe even more in the importance of basketball tactics. In recent years,</p>
<p>the various teams in Shanghai have been able to understand</p>
<p>this point and have definitely made a lot of progress compared to before.</p>
<p>However, there are still not many players with outstanding</p>
<p>individual skills. I hope that in the future, they can also put in</p>
<p>hard work in terms of skills, so that tactics and skills</p>
<p>can advance at the same time. Then the improvement of the basketball level</p>
<p>can definitely be predicted. Our team</p>
<p>was established not long ago. Fortunately, we have received guidance</p>
<p>from advanced sports figures and encouragement from the sports world.</p>
<p>Looking at the past achievements, they are still unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>We now plan to hire a good coach and continue</p>
<p>training, hoping to become an excellent</p>
<p>team. And recently we have established a Star</p>
<p>miniature soccer team, hoping that all sectors will give us advice!"</p>
<h3>This Morning's Softball Semi-Finals: Panda Takes on the Philippine Community, Meanwhile Western Youth Battles the Portuguese Business Red Team</h3>
<p>— Miao Shan</p>
<p>Since this newspaper began</p>
<p>reporting on and advocating for</p>
<p>softball, the nation has gradually paid more</p>
<p>attention. Last Sunday, Panda was originally scheduled to</p>
<p>fight the Portuguese Business Red team, and Chinese fans</p>
<p>all flocked to the location, filling it completely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to continuous rain, the field</p>
<p>became waterlogged and the game had to be postponed, causing</p>
<p>thousands of fans to travel back and forth in vain. The authorities deeply</p>
<p>expressed their regret. Today (the 20th),</p>
<p>starting at 9:45 AM, there will be two important and exciting matches</p>
<p>at Jiaozhou Park. The first match will feature the strong Chinese team Panda (P</p>
<p>audas) against the Philippine community's EU.Kni</p>
<p>ghts. The second match will be between Western Youth (Y.</p>
<p>Cubs) and the Portuguese Business Red team (Lusir</p>
<p>ano Reds). These four teams have</p>
<p>never been defeated in the league, and each holds</p>
<p>great ambitions. Therefore, today's matches are nothing short of</p>
<p>a decisive battle, and the winner will have the hope of reaching the championship</p>
<p>finals. Therefore, today, fans</p>
<p>can witness the nimble style of our Chinese team, and</p>
<p>at the same time, they can also witness the skills of various Western teams. If the weather cooperates, and the field</p>
<p>is not flooded, then these two exciting</p>
<p>matches will definitely take place as scheduled.</p>
<p>Sports Miscellany</p>
<p>After the conclusion of the</p>
<p>Volleyball League's Women's Group A, only Group B</p>
<p>competition is currently ongoing. It is rumored that there may be a</p>
<p>charity match in the near future. The Men's group will most likely be</p>
<p>the Group A champion Yuehua team against a mixed team.</p>
<p>The mixed team will be composed of the elite players from the Huaying White team. The Women's team is still under discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding the teams for the next season's Football League Group A,</p>
<p>there may be changes. There is a possibility of increasing</p>
<p>the number of teams. (Quietly)</p>
