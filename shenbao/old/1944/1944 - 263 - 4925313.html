<h3>安定民生的最低要求</h3>
<p>我們屢次指陳上海目前的嚴重問題，一是治安，一是民生，而治安與民生更具有密切關係。這兩個問題，同時也就是上海的危機，爲了建設新上海，爲了克盡後方重要基地的任務。對於這兩個問題必須解決，對於這兩種危機必須克服。　　進一步說，治安的確立，不僅軍警的責任，一般市民也有共同維護的義務。可是，在民生問題嚴重之時，一部分市民因爲生活困難挺而走險，使治安問題益增嚴重性。同時，擔任治安責任的軍警人員，也因生活困難而不能充分盡職，也使治安問題益增嚴重性。在這樣的情勢之下，所以，我們始終認爲民生問題，必須隨時隨地迅謀解決。　　民生問題在上海，主要的是米糧與燃料，米煤兩項如能獲得圓滿解決，那末，市民生活可說已經一大半解決了。所以，解決民生問題，只要把握米煤兩事。可惜上海並不產米產煤，完全仰給外地，而上海的人口衆多，消耗量極大，目前交通運輸又極困難，所以，上海的米煤供給，在環境上已經成爲很困難的問題了。然而，環境上雖有困難，事實上卻又不能不打破困難，以謀最低限度的解決。我們先言米糧，對於米糧問題，我們過去所作的建議獨多。自從米糧統制會改組以來，我們更竭誠靜待統制人事與方法的革新。可是，我們知道這次戶口米的恢復配給，是借用現地盟邦所有的軍米，爲期不過兩月，瞬即屆滿。而繼續配給的，就需仰給於米統會所採辦的。我們相信改組後的米統會當局對於配給戶口米，必能如期如量供給，決不會發生問題吧！同時，據我們所知改組後的米統會當局對於本市配給戶口米，已會表示負責供給，在此借米將罄之時，我們相信米統會早已準備就緒，決不致臨渴掘井，必能安慰市民喁望的。　　不過，最近米統會對於兩月前上海市府所訂之米糧搬運補救辦法堅持廢止，而日昨大陸新了載稱祗准在八公斤以內之米糧可以自由移運。對於這消息姑不論其確實與否，更不論其辦法如何變更，我們認爲市府之補救辦法即十石以下自由移運一點，在戶口米未能足量配給之前，在任何情形之下，不應變更的，經騐昭示我們，除非每人有足量的戶口米配給，否則凡是足以刺激米價黑市上漲的辦法，再不能隨便決定，重蹈過去覆轍。　　其次，昨日報載經濟保安處所沒收之未登記米糧，將移交米統會支配。我們認爲經濟保安處所沒收之米，是因未遵守物品配給處佈告登記而充公的，則沒收之米應交物品配給處支配。況且，沒收的米是上海市民所有，取之於上海市民者，應即用之於上海市民。所以，不應移交米統會支配。　　總之，我們主張：○今後米統會必須負責經常如期供給戶口米之配給。○米統會不能再有刺激米價的措置。○經濟保安處沒收之米應移交物品配給處作爲配給戶口米之用·我們這些主張之目的。就是安定民生問題的最低要求，進而克服上海當前的危機。</p>

<h3>帛琉摩鹿加等島日守軍血戰不息航空隊擊沉敵巡艦一艘</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　帛琉羣島及摩鹿加羣島摩羅泰島方面，敵軍之砲火邇後更趨猛烈，日守軍在敵軍猛攻下，連日連夜血戰不息，予敵以重大損害，其戰門經過情況如次：○培里流島，日守軍在飛行塲北側及南端陸續戰門中，因日軍攻擊猛烈，敵軍損害甚重。敵軍見戰勢遲遲不進，乃於二十日突然以艦上砲火及飛機轟擊飛行塲北部之日軍陣地，故日軍陣地全被破壞，然將兵之士氣依然旺盛，飛行塲南端之日軍，仍在勇敢戰門中。由飛行塲北部即可見旭旗在砲烟彈雨中嚴然聳立，培里琉島以北各島嶼，現在尚無敵軍蠢動，二十日僅發現一部敵艦，侵入帛琉本島北方環礁地帶之哥其索爾水道。○安格維爾島，日守軍逐次收縮戰綫，繼續奮戰，予敵之損害甚大。日軍一部在該島西北高地整理戰綫後，增強戰力，十九日敵之優勢部隊與戰車來攻時，當將之擊退，使受重創。由制琉本島望之，十八日晚培里琉及安格維爾兩島似展開姜絕之激戰，夜中射出之照明彈，計有三百餘個，暗夜中兩島之日守軍因皆以軍力肉搏，故敵始一方發射照明彈，一方應戰。○摩羅泰島敵之一部，在距該島南端橋頭堡南九公里，北二十里二處登陸，目下敵以海軍侵入腹土約七公里，構築陣地，並建設飛機塲。反之，日守軍則於十八日薄暮，實行壯烈之攻擊，收有偉大戰果。據該島日守軍消息稱：日將兵之士氣極爲旺盛。又日機隊十八日黎明攻擊摩羅泰島潛艇運輸船，炸燬巡洋艦一艘，運輸艦二艘，炸艦驅逐艦及舟艇多艘，復轟炸登陸地點之燈火地帶。　　東京二十二日中央社電　中部太平洋日軍基地電，日航空部隊，十九日在帛琉島哥茲塞瓜海峽附近，擊沉敵巡洋艦一艘，其後判明是日並擊沉艦種未詳敵艦一艘。　　東京二十二日中央社電　中部太平洋日軍某基地電，培里琉島敵軍，自二十日指曉於熾烈砲擊掩護下，以戰車十四輛，步兵約一大隊，攻擊東山及觀察山，遭日軍猛烈反擊，未得接近日軍陣地，悉被擊退。該島中央高地一帶，仍在日軍確保中，敵軍於機塲南方，構築以砲兵及戰車爲主體之橋頭堡，日軍爲避免損失，多作夜襲，潛入敵陣深處，每次均予敵極大衝動。　　東京二十二日中央社電　中部太平洋日軍基地電，安格維爾島日軍，於二十日夜以來，乘星夜突入敵陣深處，予敵重創　　西南太平洋基地二十二日中央社電　日機隊十九日下午轟炸摩羅泰島沿岸之敵物資貯藏所及建設中之飛機塲，投彈多枚，使敵設施八處發生大火後，日機即全全部飛返。</p>

<h3>調查金融機關負責人資歷財部令公會簽具意見</h3>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　年來京滬一帶股份有限公司組織之金融機關，設立甚多，間有資本短絀，或經營失當者，一遇市面銀根緊迫，即難免有擱淺情事。其現任董事長及常務董事，職責所在，自不能任意卸責。記者特以此事走防財政部負責人，承見告如左：近查各地行莊公司，選舉董事長常務董事，其經騐宏富，克盡厥職者固屬多數，而資望未孚，濫竽充數，或身兼數職，空有虛名者，間亦不少。一遇事故發生，諉不負責，逍遙法外，殊堪痛恨。本部長鑒於京滬兩地均已有上述類似情形發生，爲愼重考思前慮，顧後起見，已分令各地銀錢業及信託業同業公會，傳知各該同業會員，迅　現任董事長及常務董事，學歷經歷籍貫年齡，現在住址，及永久住址，重行開具清單，附同選舉董監之議事紀錄，送由各該公會詳實調查，並由該公會簽具意見，列表分批報部核辦。其在本年十月一月以後改選或選任者，應由各行莊公司同樣辦理，取具各該公會保結，逕呈本部查核，以專責成，而杜流弊云。</p>
<h3>聽取中國有識之士的言論</h3>
<p>欲求根本改善中日關係的方法，唯兩方要能率直的推心置腹，始克有濟。而欲打開當前的極其複雜的情勢，決非阿諛附和，嘲笑或謾罵所能濟事。我們對重慶政權的對日抗戰，及其附隨英美政策的謬誤，固須促其徹底醒覺，但亦不徒事咒罵以爲快！就是對國民政府，也不應單從表面的禮讚予以支持了事。換句話說，應該批評的就行批評，應該警告的就得警告，這種率直的態度，才是給與眞正的協力支持。同時，我們須要有虛心聽取中國人士眞摯率直的意見和希望的雅量。就事實而言，我們對中國的言論，縱能毫無忌憚？可是中國對日本的言論，不是相當地客氣嗎？因此，我們應當更進一步，予中國有識之士以大膽率直表達他自己之信念的機會。　　像最近申報上發表的張紹昌氏[敬告中日愛國之士]一文，亦以此種見解，而備受歡迎。張氏總括中日問題不獲解決的原因，在於沒有一個[信]字，而又分析沒有[信]的原因爲三點：○忽視了國民的意志與力量。○事變以來，中日兩方的和平運動者中，眞誠的份子固多，而專謀私利的份子也不少。○日本政府發表的對華聲明，還有未完全實現的地方。關於中日問題應怎樣解決的質問，張氏亦就[中日應共同努力的]及[中日兩方應就各自立塲努力]的兩點加以分論。即是希望日本方面應努力者，要以事實博得中國國民的信賴，改善對華態度，和對華認識；這不單是日本有識之士，即全體日本國民，也應有徹底的理解。　　張紹昌氏再三強調，日本應完全實行對華聲明，並以事實博取中國民衆的信賴，爲最有效辦法。惟吾人想指出以下兩點：○日本所標榜的對華政策之中有須待全面和平實現，或俟大東亞戰爭結束後始能實現者。○即僅徴諸過去日本所實踐的事實而觀，對於對策道義政策之眞實性，亦絕對不能表示疑義。然而，我們聽到張氏這種坦白的中國人士之率直的希望，殊感愉快。張氏旦舉[信]字以爲中日關係之準繩，並記述看日本電影中，西鄉與勝會談之一幕，大爲感動，而發出解決中日問題也應有這種精神的共鳴。的確，不論是個人，是團體，抑是國家間的問題，要解決今日中日間的錯雜關係，祇要有能容受一切的率直雅度，超越微末的利害或對立，彼此披瀝肝胆，眞誠合作，方始有補於事實。重慶政權的所以迄今未與日本接近，與其說是反對日本的政策，倒不如說由[信]字之不澈底。這是日本不能不加以深切考獻的。總之，無論如何，今後我們當更進一步，助長中國有識之士及愛國份子，使他們能坦白坡瀝其所思之傾向。（大川譯自九月二十二日大陸新報社評）</p>

<h3>桂粵省境日軍已迫近梧州並攻陷西江右岸要衝德慶</h3>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　據路透社重慶訊，粵桂省境日軍，於二十日已迫近梧州，頃該市已陷於危險情勢中云。又據每日電訊社訊，渝軍當局已承認此次日軍之作戰爲切斷中國大陸，日軍一部已達至距桂林六十公里地點，另一部自雷州半島已抵達梧州東北方之五公里。由於以上事實，海南島香港間之陸運連絡，已打通百四十公里云。　　華南前綫二十二日中央社電　廣東日軍蕩盡四會·肇慶·方面敗退之渝第百五十九·第百五十六兩師之一部後，二十日傍晚，進至西江右岸要衝德慶（肇慶上流約八十公里），左側後方，先鋒部隊擊潰渝軍頑強抵抗，同夜十一時突入市內，開始掃蕩戰。他方日軍主力亦繼續突入市內，將該城安全佔領。按德慶係渝第三十五集團軍司令部所在地，乃渝軍防衛廣西前衛地，故該地之陷落，於軍事上實有重大意義。</p>
<h3>渝方發表戰況公報</h3>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　據重慶電：渝　司令部二十一日下午發表戰況公報如次：沿湘桂鐵路進攻之日軍，十九日在興安東北約十五公里之處，渝軍正邀擊中。又由粵東新興向西北進攻之日軍一隊，十九日到達雲浮附近，自信都向西南進攻之日軍，抵達梧州東北十五公里之地。重慶對此日軍正邀擊中。湖南實慶一帶之戰門，二十日已告激烈。　　廣州二十二日中央社電　重慶軍事委員會，二十一日發表稱，沿西江繼續進擊之日軍，十九日進迫梧州東北方六里處，並發表戰況如次：○梧州郊外戰門已愈激烈，自東方迂廻前進之日軍，現在猛攻大坡岑·龍骨塘一帶，自東北方進擊之日軍，已抵達資水東岸，刻正激戰中。○自湘桂鐵路南下之日軍，已於安東北界首附近交戰中，日空軍二十日會轟炸興安。○西江方面，自鹿步阡西進，抵達德慶之日軍部隊，直至十九日仍按兵不動，戰況亦無變動。</p>
<h3>桂林行將展開決戰</h3>
<p>中央社訊　湘桂省境日軍主力，攻佔全縣後，更由湘桂鐵路，一路南下，刻已迫近桂林近前衝要衝興安，展開肉搏戰。一方佔領湖南南方道縣之日軍，繼續西進，直攻全縣南方五十公里之灌陽。另一部南下日軍，控壓永明及江華，自東方形成攻略桂林態勢。同時日華南軍與此相呼應，自廣東省發動攻勢，其精銳部隊業將要衝肇慶佔領。攻取懷集之部隊，已突入信都，廣西省之桂林感受一大威脅。刻北方永明江華等，與南方懷集信都之南北兩部日軍，相距僅百四十餘公里，目下方面採取包圍態勢，今雙方攻防戰日趨激烈。渝方外人記者對如是之戰略態勢，與日軍驚異之進展，均極重視。並謂日軍之橫斷中國大陸作戰，僅餘有百四十餘公里之間隙，承認日軍進展迅速，及事態重大，大陸分割敵軍必然退卻，因此彼等之樂觀論又成泡影。渝美聯軍見於此種事態極爲狼狽，會疾呼[焦土轟炸日本]之美空軍司令官捷諾特，終將彼等苦心慘淡完成之桂林航空要塞，自行炸毀，退守柳州，準備最後之抵抗。渝軍當局已嚴令死守桂林，疏散全部市民，積極趕築要塞，加緊防衛。據重慶大公報載，渝軍刻正向該方面增援大軍，又蔣介石近或將北緬及雲南戰綫，作戰中之機械化美式渝軍調至廣西方面作戰地，與最近陸續開抵渝方之美陸軍混合，因之中國戰綫大決戰，又將以桂林爲中心而呢開云。</p>
<h3>肇慶治安業已恢復</h3>
<p>華南前綫二十二日中央社電　粵西日軍十六日攻入肇慶後，該地治安立即恢復，市面日見繁華，市民對日軍軍紀之嚴正，尤爲敬服。傳肇慶於未攻陷前，當地物資已完全移入內地，市民亦全部疎散。迨日軍入城後，見市民仍甚夥，物資亦多未移去。日軍入城第二日，市塲即開市，市民頗有協力日軍之勢。此種情形原因，一在日軍此次作戰，目的在擊滅英美，其二，人民已深解日軍發表之渝軍，若不抵抗日軍亦與友好之眞意。</p>
<h3>蔣在保全直系勢力</h3>
<p>廣州二十二日中央社電　據渝方報告，蔣介石氏近會嚴令桂林柳州兩地警備司令官，死守各該守備地區，蓋西南中國之最大空軍基地桂林及柳州，在日軍攻擊前，已頻危殆，此爲蔣氏本人亦承認者。然蔣氏明知該兩地無守備之可能，但仍使桂軍抵搞日軍者，實欲使桂軍受重大犧牲，以謀保存其直系勢力也。前此因負敗戰責任而被處死刑者已數見不鮮，如第四軍長兼長沙警備司令官張德能，曁其他多數將領，類皆如此。此次廣西軍旣被強迫進行毫無把握之作戰，其終將蹈前轍無疑，因廣西軍此次作戰不遭陣亡即被處死刑也。傳廣西軍將領間對蔣氏此種冷酷行爲，發生極大之不滿與反感。</p>
<h3>青少年指導會我國代表決定</h3>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　二屆大東亞青少年指導會議，十月九日在南京舉行大會，議長一席，由我國青少團總監担任外，所有我國出席代表幹事曁隨員，亦決定如下：代表喻熙傑，首席幹事鍾任壽，幹事華漢光·許錫慶·呂一峯·朱晶華，隨員華杰生·楊正字·劉紫風·周森·陳少翔。</p>
<h3>宇垣訪王克敏</h3>
<p>北平二十二日中央社電　日字垣大將於二十一日午後五時，赴華北政委員訪問王委員長懇談，當晚王氏並設宴招待。</p>
<h3>反軕心傘兵會師遭堅強抵抗</h3>
<p>亞琛渡河點戰事熾烈　　里斯本廿二日中央社電　英第二軍自第一空輸師團降陸於荷蘭以來，即開始急進，當分爲二隊，其一北進渡萊因河，另一隊似向德領進攻。據美聯社反軸心軍最高司令部消息：正於魯爾河萊因河間橋樑展開激戰中。　　里斯本二十二日中央社電　據德軍當局宣稱：在亞琛地區降落之反軸心軍第一降落傘師，已被迫於瓦爾（Waal）橋頭堡瀕於殲滅危境，新降落之增援部隊大半亦被殲滅，反軸心第一降落傘師之主力，現正渴望救援中。據美聯社前綫訊：在尼美根（Nijmegen）區與英第二軍會合之美軍傘兵，佔領萊因橋樑後，爲救濟亞琛之英傘兵，一路北進。按英傘兵所支持之亞琛渡河點，乃進攻德土要路，實爲決定西部戰綫北部戰局之前鍵，故戰事之焦點已集中於此。　　柏林二十二日中央社電　海通社訊：荷蘭中部繆斯·瓦爾·及勒河（Lek）間主要陣地之大爭奪戰，尚未決勝負。英第二軍已推進至瓦爾及尼美根區，並已與着陸之空運軍會師，但所完成之走廊太狹，不足爲繼續作戰之適常基地。德軍不但賡續側擊該走廊，同時亦攻擊尼美根之空運軍，美軍續由空中增援，尚能保持其在尼美根之陣地。在亞琛着陸之英第一空運師，處境則較困難，經德軍之反攻，其兵力已被消滅一部份，倘鄧浦賽將軍未能提早與其會師，終有被完全消滅之虞。荷蘭廉堡之東北，美第一軍經空軍之掩護，昨已越過席塔（Sittard）·海關林（Heerlen）陣綫，迫近德國邊界，但尚未能越境，但在海爾林東南，大隊美軍已入德境進抵亞琛城西北郊，德軍已採取反措施，以阻止美軍由北包圍該城。亞琛·史托爾堡·蒙斯曹區，美第一軍之右翼，尚未能恢復數日前所喪失之主動，美軍突擊失敗之後，德軍反攻，克復堅強碉堡數處。</p>
<h3>里米蒙特市展開爭奪戰</h3>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　德國社訊，據德官方戰報稱：敵以大軍攻法東北部之里米蒙特區（emiremont），雙方刻正對該市發生爭奪戰。</p>
<h3>羅斯福委派大使駐巴黎</h3>
<p>瑞典京城廿二日中央社電　德國社訊華盛頓消息：前美駐巴西大使加弗萊，已被任爲羅斯福總統駐巴黎之代表，加氏將仍保持其大使外交官級，不久即將首途赴任。</p>
<h3>芬蘭簽爬山虎協定後仍未能脫離戰禍</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十二日中央社電　芬蘭爲防術本國，五年來與蘇聯作英雄之抗戰，然終以悲慘之結果閉幕。芬蘭代理總理波恩當十九日夜發表休戰條件之際，會以悲痛語調，謂一九四四年九月十九日實爲芬蘭史上苦惱之日云。據赫爾辛基消息，當波恩氏發表協定條件之際，芬京市民多有悲淚者，蓋芬蘭國民用盡最後一彈，戰至最後一兵，結果猶遭今日之悲慘，幫當休戰條件發表後，芬京各戶均懸半旗，新聞號外亦以黑色作邊，飯店歇業，大街小巷充滿悲慘氣氛。　　　　　又二十日之瑞典各報晨刋論稱，休戰條約較預期者實甚苛酷。根據該約，蘇聯已於芬蘭　北岸建設一新屬國，蘇聯領有波耳加拉半島，實爲芬蘭之致命打擊。芬蘭英雄之抗戰，愼重之和平交涉結果，均與眞正所期者相去甚遠。芬蘭由於今次之休戰協定，已淪爲蘇聯之屬國，即將喪失國家之獨立，芬蘭非僅未能獲得實際和平，且更未能脫出戰塲。瑞京消息靈通界就芬蘭休戰協定所招來之結果，觀測如次：○蘇聯必將對德遂行戰爭上之芬蘭有利之重要戰略地域悉予以佔領。○德軍式裝未完全解除前，解除芬軍武裝實不可能，故必利用之對德作戰。○德軍已強化北部之戰略陣地，故德芬兩軍戰門益趨激化，因此瑞典京必遭及戰禍。</p>
<h3>內閣改組</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十一日中央社電　海通社訊：芬蘭政府昨日公布內閣改組，最高法院院長卡斯特偷已被任爲總理，以繼近在莫斯科患病之赫克齊爾。工聯領袖甫沃理及前社會幸福部長法加賀姆亦已入閣，因其爲所謂和平派之領袖。內閣名單如次：總理卡斯特倫，外長恩克，司法部長波恩，內長希利萊，國防部長華爾頓將軍，財長希托年，社會福利部長法加賀姆，糧食部長艾勒拉。</p>
<h3>芬斯絕交</h3>
<p>布拉的斯拉發二十二日中央社電　德國社訊：由斯洛伐克有資格人士方面獲悉芬蘭駐斯洛伐克代理公使，昨日造訪斯邦總理兼外長蒂沙，告以芬政府根據與蘇聯所訂之休戰條約，與斯洛伐克斷絕外交關係。</p>
<h3>傳邱吉爾赴蘇訪晤斯達林</h3>

<h3>敵美損失慘重攻菲必難得逞松島部長昨發表談話</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部松島部長，於昨（二十二）日下午二時半，在循例接見本市中國新聞記者，列述敵美在太平洋上之遭受日軍嚴重打擊，損害慘重，並披瀝日軍在大陸作戰之目的，乃在擊滅渝方幕後之英美勢力。談話錄下</p>
<h3>日在大陸作戰成功</h3>
<p>部長首謂根據同盟社二十日里斯本電，關於敵方南太平洋司令長　尼米茲發表稱：　第十四航空部隊·因放棄桂林航空基地，與太平洋上美軍協力云云。關於此項情形，足見日軍在大陸上之作戰成功，同時更連想至沿海一帶之溫州爲日軍佔傾，因此敵美之企圖不及實現，先爲日軍所對銷矣。最近敵美在渝飛機，僅六百餘架，自連續經日航空部隊之猛烈攻擊，尚未見增強，預料不久敵美空軍即將被擊滅，尤其第二十航空部隊由於燃料缺乏，未能運用滿足，且最近航空基地逐受壓迫，向西北方遷離，在今後根據日軍之進展，敵美在渝空軍，將更爲困難。再如在大陸之日本陸海軍航空部隊，最近益將特別驚人之增加，負譽世界第一之新銳虞鬥機已出現於大陸，是以不問敵方之如何誇張宣傳，預料不久之敵方企圖，完全粉碎。</p>
<h3>敵美攻菲必難得逞</h3>
<p>次述太平洋戰局狀況，謂在帛琉羣島北方之培里琉島，敵第三艦隊從九月十五日以來，連續苦鬥疲於奔命，至十九日正，敵方損害死傷兵員八千七百人，並損失巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘，潛水艇一艘，掃海艦一艘，大型運輸艦一艘，其他一艘，　外又有登陸用舟艇六十一隻以上。且於十八日敵美會駛來萬噸大型兵艦一艘，前往收容傷兵。敵方過去在塞班島時，經四十日之苦門，發表損傷人員爲一萬但將倍里琉島之面積相比，僅及塞島三分之一，今四日苦戰，已有此巨大損害，故將塞班島之戰役比較，經日軍之猛烈攻擊，敵損害已達十倍以上，因此敵美發表，在倍里琉島之戰鬥，受日軍之抵抗，實爲空前歷史所未有，亦即遭受空前極大之損失。頃敵美在南太平洋之作戰，一面從帛琉本島，一面則在哈耳馬希拉島兩路攻菲與菲島形成三角形勢，敵方在帛哈兩島周圍，已深受日軍之猛擊，損失慘重，當初敵美進攻塞班島時兵力爲三師，如今以二師兵力，巳遭受嚴重損失，故敵方攻菲，絕非輕舉易事。旋松島部長又謂安格維爾島向爲島　之地，而美兵之艦據於此，定必飽受島　。</p>
<h3>空路援渝困難非常</h3>
<p>部長繼述自敵美納爾遜哈萊二人之赴渝，與渝方會議決定，今後利用空路，補充渝方大量軍需物資，我人今觀敵美生產，在目前已特別困難，開闢空路運輸援渝，將徒成空言，尤其敵美認爲量重要B29型機，亦無法補充，故欲利用空路援渝，殊難可能。旋又就最近渝舉行之參政會，蔣介石氏發表演說，內容有[轉敗制勝轉危爲安]一言，部長謂渝方於最近失落衡陽等地，轉勝實不可能。蔣氏之樂觀，乃依賴英美在歐洲之戰局態勢，及以英美對渝之援助，而確信中國之運命，但以目前之現勢而論，則蔣氏之談話，其形勢適得其反。即使渝[抗戰]能完遂勝利，絕非渝方之勝利，假用英美力量而制勝，屆時英美是否認渝方爲戰勝國之一員，殊爲疑問。如今日對渝作戰情形截然不同，目的並非對渝方及中國，乃攻擊渝方之幕後的英美勢力，當中日事變之初，日本之止的亦對渝蔣之幕後英美戰鬥，迨至大東亞戰事爆發，至今目的不變。</p>
<h3>敵美暴行令人髪指</h3>
<p>查日軍佔領長沙衡陽後，敵美空軍恆盲目轟炸無辜平民，致一般民衆歸家不得，情形殊爲悲慘，敵美暴戾殘忍，無以復加。其企圖擊滅東亞人之夢想，舉動卑劣，不啻爲猶太式之手段。如在帛琉羣島之日婦女撤退時，適遇敵美之潛水艇浮起，竟殘酷以機槍掃射，引爲嘻笑作樂。又最近美國芝加哥都市征募海軍陸戰隊廣告中，竟公然宣傳稱，已屆狩獵季節，以日人爲行獵對象，中國人作其警犬，其蔑視東亞人，令人髪指。</p>

<h3>[山道年]中毒現象</h3>
<p>近來一般商業廣告，常宣傳某種藥品或糖果，全以山道年（Santonin）爲主要成份……。專治小孩百病，服之能使瘦弱者變爲壯強，驅虫消只食……等等功用。查山道年並無開胃潤腸，助長發育等功用，只不過是一種絕對靠得住的驅虫劑而已。小孩們若常服此類製劑，雖含量極少，亦能起積聚作用，而起中毒等流幣，況且現值秋令節季，小孩們因飲食不愼，患病者極多，尤以傷寒（腸熱病），痢疾，胃腸炎等症爲最多數。茲將其功效及中毒現象，分別於左：　　山道年（Santonin）又譯作珊篤忍。驅虫劑。　　功效：主用於驅蛔虫，亦用於曉虫與鞭虫。　　學理：因山道年極易吸收，吸收後在體內雙化，其變化產物，排泄於小腸，麻痺蛔虫等，而奏驅虫之效。　　中毒現象：山道年如被身體吸收，往往在藥用量內，巳能起黃視，（即視覺所見均是黃色。）幻嗅幻味，若服多量後，則顯體溫沈降，意識糢糊，顏面筋及咀嚼筋起撞擊，重者全身起痓　，遂陷於昏睡狀態，因呼吸停止而死。或因山道年而起賢職炎，排泄蛋白尿與血尿，除發急性中毒外，久用山道年，則幻視，黃視，幻嗅，失誠等，慢性中毒者，雖中止用藥，其症狀亦不易消失。見藥理學三一四至三一五頁驅虫劑。東京帝大醫學醫士林春雄著。同校醫學士劉懋淳澤。昭和五年一月發行版。（胡采卷）</p>

<p>很快地到了三月。　　天氣好像補木炭之不足，而風和日暖起來了。三月初三的女人祭偶節雖然陰天，但早開的桃花卻深感到是明朗的春天。　　[最近將發表特別攻擊隊的偉大戰果，你準備這樣畫吧！]　　飛田中校這樣命令後，隆夫感到方語所不能形容的快樂。兩月前的宿願，終於將滿足了。　　但飛田中校的聲音裹，而色上，在在都表現著過度的深沉，情緒激昂起來的隆夫，並沒注意這一點，而急忙想跑回自己的房間，於是飛田中校在後而大聲喊住他：　　[喂，你……]　　[呵？]　　隆夫一回頭，看見眼淚汪汪的中校在凝視着他。　　[並非有公事……]　　中校突然轉向傍面開始辦公了。　　隆夫就這樣回去了。　　正想書輸廓時，突然感到材料不足。特殊潛航艇因屬於機密事項裹，所以無法知道全部情形，但爲了稍微有一點暗示，就不能不請教軍令部員，討論畫圖的構造內容。　　從軍令部回到家裹，他開始細續領回來的發表草案。　　——如此確信皇威及天佑神助的特別攻擊隊，某月某日銜枚走上征途，一路向眞珠書直航，由沉着純熟的駕駛，竟突破敵人嚴密而複雜的水中警戒綱，而全部隊艇按預定計畫進入港內，或斷行白畫強襲，或大胆進行空前的壯舉，完成任務後，即與舟艇共同結束自己的生命。其中夜襲時敵方阿利遜型戰鬥艦被擊沉，這是遠在港外的日本友軍部隊也會看得很清楚的，十二月八日下午四時三十一分（夏威夷時間七日下午九時一分），即夏威夷月出二分後，眞珠灣港內發生劇烈爆炸，火焰沖天，火花鐵片，高空亂舞，須臾間火焰捕滅，與此同時，敵方誤認爲是日本航空部隊的攻擊，於是開始向空中發出熾烈的高射砲火。又同日下午六時十一分（夏威夷時間下午十時四十一分），無綫電報告，特別攻擊隊一艇襲擊成功，下午七時十四分以後無綫電報告斷絕。此時或自動擊沉，或被轟沉。（中略）　　出發時，雖會受命如攻擊終了則立刻歸隊，（中略）然全體隊員視死如歸，專心一意發揮攻擊效果，而在心頭上並未存歸隊之意——　　[眞英勇壯烈呵！]　　隆夫這樣大聲唸着。於是他想起吳鎭的潛水學校來。這樣偉大戰果，這樣擊沉敵方無畏戰艦，終於埋頭苦幹四十年的日本帝國潛水艇，開放光明燦爛的花朶，想到這一點時，就不禁淚滴落下。（一四四）</p>
<h3>舊工部局華童學校之教育性格○上野太忠</h3>
<p>○學生從不參加校　　外任何活動　　他們似乎深信文化與政治，是必須分開的，更不欲以學校學生，爲政治工具，無論什麼紀念集會遊行等團體工作，從不赴校外參加，全不管校外烽火滿天，而照舊我行我素的上課。外界任何思想潮流，也難得傳進華童學校的大門。他們祇是讀書上課，如果說學校是社會的縮型，他們似乎並不這樣。不僅對外界如此，即對工部局局立各學校之間，本來也該有兄弟的關係，可是也從不看見他們開過一次聯合運動會，遊藝會或演講會……或任何表演比賽的集會。民國二十三年，會經有過一次小規模的四小學一女中的體育表演會。又民國二十七年，華人教育處十週紀念，會選各小學成績展覽，並作示範教學——這可算是空前絕後的了。　　○學生的出路　　學校因地點的不同，而學生的出路，也各異。大致近工商區的畢業生，就業或充學徒者（小學）多於升學，反之在住宅區的學校，升學者較多，最可注意者，即假定吾人認爲中等教育係普通教育，——其出路應寬不應窄，則華童公學學生之前途，恰與之相反，雖儘有不能入香港大學劍橋大學而入國內各大學者，但這在華童中學的本身看來，似乎是增的左道旁門，實際上，華童中學畢業生，多見於海關郵局洋行銀行以及工部局各處，如將上述各處的人員加以精確的統計，必可見其極有興趣之記錄。（六）行政的特徵　　就廣義而言，學校行政，應指有關辦理學校的一切方法，但本文所言，則僅指學校行政系統及對於施政有關之各點。茲略加途述如下。　　○不輕加改變　　行政設施，從不輕加變更。換言之，即旣經實行之辦法，倘無十分不妥之處，寗取保守的態度不作積極的改進。或謂此種設施，不免缺少實騐的精神，但就教學方法而言，亦未見如何墨守成規，或不合時代之處。（小學對於教學方法的研究且有顯著的發展詳見小學教師雜誌三卷）也許這是英國人傳統的審愼的態度，一切措施，不使事物有頓改舊觀之嫌。譬如成績考核標準·懲獎條例，考試規則，操塲禮堂教室公約，每週五天上課的辦法，均在不成文的規定下，數十年如一日，鮮有更改者。至於學校人員的調動，職務的分配，教學設施方針</p>
<p>，以及學校對於各方面的關係，也都保持着向例，一仍舊貫。總之，行政上的一切設施，無論優劣，　　○校長的任務　　華童中學在校長以外，並沒有什麼教備主任訓育主任和總務主任之類，祇有中西助理和一人（中國助理於民國二十二年經董事會通過始添置對外稱爲副校長）小學除一級教師（教務主任）一人外，也沒有其他的主任，這是否因爲要便於達到訓教合一的標準，故使教務主任兼訓育職務，抑或有其他原因，不可得知。但無論如何，中學校長的權力，是比較得特別大，也可說是校長集權制，沒有什麼集體會議，也沒有什麼分　職務的專司，更不見掛滿牆壁的統計表格。因此校長的優劣，立即可以左右全校的運命。至於小學校長工作雖繁，一部分行政事宜，已由華人教育處綜合規劃，因此責任校輕。於處理日常行政之餘，致力於輔導的任務。如課室的視察，學校環境的佈置，會議及集體活動的參加。兒童活動的指導，實際教學的轉導及考核等。</p>

<h3>The Minimum Requirements for Stabilizing People's Livelihoods</h3>
<p>We have repeatedly pointed out the serious problems currently facing Shanghai, namely public security and people's livelihoods, with public security and people's livelihoods being closely related. These two issues are simultaneously Shanghai's crises. To build a new Shanghai, and to fulfill the important task of being a rear area base, these two problems must be solved, and these two crises must be overcome.</p>
<p>Further, the establishment of public security is not only the responsibility of the military and police; ordinary citizens also have a shared obligation to maintain it. However, when livelihood problems are severe, some citizens, due to difficulties in making a living, resort to taking risks, which makes public security problems even more serious. At the same time, military and police personnel responsible for public security are also unable to fully perform their duties due to difficulties in making a living, which also makes public security problems even more serious. Under such circumstances, we consistently believe that livelihood problems must be addressed swiftly and at all times.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the main livelihood problems are rice and fuel. If these two items, rice and coal, can be satisfactorily resolved, then it can be said that a large part of the citizens' lives has already been solved. Therefore, to solve livelihood problems, it is only necessary to grasp the two matters of rice and coal. Unfortunately, Shanghai does not produce rice or coal, relying entirely on external sources. Furthermore, Shanghai's population is large, and consumption is extremely high. Currently, transportation is also very difficult, so the supply of rice and coal in Shanghai has already become a very difficult problem in terms of the environment. However, although there are difficulties in the environment, in reality, these difficulties must be overcome to achieve a minimum degree of resolution. We will first talk about rice. We have made many suggestions regarding the rice problem in the past. Since the reorganization of the Rice and Grain Control Association, we have been sincerely waiting for the reform of the control personnel and methods. However, we know that the current restoration of rationed rice is borrowing military rice from the Allied forces currently stationed here, and it will only last for two months, which will soon be up. To continue the rationing, it will be necessary to rely on what the Rice Control Association procures. We believe that the authorities of the reorganized Rice Control Association will definitely be able to supply rationed rice on schedule and in the required quantity, and that no problems will arise! At the same time, according to what we know, the authorities of the reorganized Rice Control Association have already expressed their responsibility for supplying rationed rice in this city. As the borrowed rice is about to run out, we believe that the Rice Control Association has already made preparations and will definitely not resort to ad hoc measures, and will be able to reassure the citizens who are eagerly waiting.</p>
<p>However, recently the Rice Control Association insisted on abolishing the rice transportation remedy measures established by the Shanghai Municipal Government two months ago, and yesterday's *Continental New Daily* stated that only rice within eight kilograms could be freely transported. Regarding this news, regardless of whether it is accurate or not, and regardless of how the measures are changed, we believe that the city government's remedy measure, that is, free transportation of up to ten *shi* (a unit of dry measure), should not be changed under any circumstances before the rationed rice can be supplied in sufficient quantity. Experience shows us that unless each person has a sufficient amount of rationed rice, any measures that are sufficient to stimulate the rise of rice prices in the black market should not be casually decided, repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>Secondly, yesterday's newspaper reported that the unregistered rice confiscated by the Economic Security Office will be transferred to the Rice Control Association for distribution. We believe that the rice confiscated by the Economic Security Office was confiscated because it did not comply with the registration announcement of the Goods Allocation Office, then the confiscated rice should be distributed by the Goods Allocation Office. Moreover, the confiscated rice belongs to the citizens of Shanghai, and what is taken from the citizens of Shanghai should be used for the citizens of Shanghai immediately. Therefore, it should not be transferred to the Rice Control Association for distribution.</p>
<p>In summary, we advocate: ○ The Rice Control Association must be responsible for regularly supplying rationed rice on schedule in the future. ○ The Rice Control Association must not take any more measures that stimulate rice prices. ○ The rice confiscated by the Economic Security Office should be transferred to the Goods Allocation Office for use in rationing rice. The purpose of these propositions of ours is to stabilize the minimum requirements of people's livelihoods, and further overcome the current crisis in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Defenses in the Philippines, Japanese Army Decides to Fully Cooperate, Thirty American Planes Shot Down Around Manila</h3>
<p>Manila, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Philippine President Laurel announced on the 21st that a state of martial law would be implemented nationwide in the Philippines starting at 9:00 AM on September 22nd.</p>
<p>Manila, 22nd (Central News Agency) – With the nationwide implementation of martial law in the Philippines starting at 9:00 AM on the 22nd, the local Japanese army expressed its intention to fully cooperate at noon on the same day, as follows: The violent air raids of the enemy Americans have spread to Manila City.

<h3>Japanese Garrison on Palau, Moluccas Islands Fighting Fiercely, Air Force Sinks Enemy Cruiser</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – On Palau Islands and Moluccas Islands, especially in the area of Morotai Island, the enemy's artillery fire has become even more intense. The Japanese garrison is fighting fiercely day and night under the enemy's fierce attacks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The battle situation is as follows: ○ Peleliu Island: The Japanese garrison is continuously fighting on the north side of the airfield and at the southern end. The enemy has suffered heavy damage due to the fierce Japanese attacks. Seeing that the battle was progressing slowly, the enemy suddenly bombarded the Japanese positions north of the airfield with naval artillery fire and aircraft on the 20th. As a result, the Japanese positions were completely destroyed, but the morale of the soldiers remained high. The Japanese army at the southern end of the airfield is still fighting bravely. From the north of the airfield, the Rising Sun flag can be seen standing firmly amidst the smoke of artillery shells. There is currently no enemy activity on the islands north of Peleliu Island. On the 20th, only a part of the enemy fleet was discovered, intruding into the Gotzsoul Channel in the northern atoll area of Palau Island. ○ Angaur Island: The Japanese garrison is gradually shrinking the battle line and continuing to fight fiercely, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. After reorganizing the battle line on the northwest highlands of the island, part of the Japanese army strengthened its combat power. When the enemy's superior forces and tanks attacked on the 19th, they were repelled and suffered heavy damage. From Palau Island, it appeared that fierce battles were unfolding on Peleliu and Angaur Islands on the evening of the 18th. More than 300 flares were fired during the night. In the dark night, the Japanese garrisons on both islands engaged in close combat with military force, so one side fired flares while the other side fought back. ○ Morotai Island: Part of the enemy landed at two locations, 9 kilometers south of the southern bridgehead of the island and 20 *li* to the north. Currently, the enemy has intruded approximately 7 kilometers into the interior of the island with naval forces, constructing fortifications and building an airfield. Conversely, the Japanese garrison carried out a heroic attack at dusk on the 18th, achieving great battle results. According to news from the Japanese garrison on the island, the morale of the Japanese soldiers is extremely high. Also, on the 18th, at dawn, Japanese aircraft attacked the submarine transports of Morotai Island, destroying a cruiser and two transports, and bombed destroyers, boats and lighted areas of the landing site.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A Japanese military base in the central Pacific reported that on the 19th, Japanese air units sank an enemy cruiser near the Gotzsoul Strait of Palau Island. It was later determined that an enemy ship of unknown type was also sunk on the same day.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A certain Japanese military base in the central Pacific reported that on the 20th, enemy forces on Peleliu Island, under the cover of intense artillery fire, attacked Dongshan and Observation Hill with 14 tanks and approximately one battalion of infantry. They were fiercely counterattacked by the Japanese army, and were completely repulsed without being able to approach the Japanese positions. The central highlands area of the island is still secured by the Japanese army. South of the airfield, the enemy is building a bridgehead based on artillery and tanks. In order to avoid losses, the Japanese army is mostly carrying out night attacks, infiltrating deep into enemy positions, inflicting great damage on the enemy each time.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A Japanese military base in the central Pacific reported that the Japanese army on Angaur Island infiltrated deep into enemy positions under the starlight since the night of the 20th, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 22nd (Central News Agency) – On the afternoon of the 19th, Japanese aircraft bombed enemy material storage areas and an airfield under construction along the coast of Morotai Island, dropping many bombs and causing large fires at eight enemy facilities. The Japanese aircraft then returned in full.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Approves Establishment of Local Defense Headquarters, Minister of Home Affairs Ōta Explains Its Outline</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – In view of the pressing war situation, the Japanese government, in order to cope with enemy air raids on the mainland and other emergencies, urgently needs to establish close contact between local administrations. Recently, local defense headquarters have been established in nine regions nationwide as central liaison organizations for defending the country. On the 22nd, Minister of Home Affairs Ōta explained the outline of the establishment of the local defense headquarters at the cabinet meeting, which was approved and implemented immediately. The Ministry of Home Affairs issued a document to notify the chairmen of the local administrative councils and the governors. The areas of responsibility and organization of each local defense headquarters are modeled after the current organization of the nine local administrative councils. Only Yamaguchi Prefecture has been incorporated into the Chugoku Local Defense Headquarters due to the special circumstances of the Kanmon area. The head of the headquarters will be the governor who is the chairman of the local administrative council. Its constituents are the members of the local administrative council and other individuals deemed necessary by the head of the headquarters. At the same time, local officials with particularly close ties may also be included as members depending on the local situation, in addition to the members of the council. Mayors of other important cities, the chairman of the Food Management Group, and branch managers of the Bank of Japan may also attend as necessary. In addition, the chiefs of staff of the local military headquarters, naval bases, and guard districts may also participate in a qualified capacity in order to maintain close contact with each other.</p>
<h3>Actively Strengthen the Political Affairs Official System</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government, in order to utilize the political affairs official system that was revived a few years ago, has decided to conduct on-site inspections of the specific progress and feedback of the policies of each ministry, and to listen to public opinion by having political affairs officials travel to various parts of the country at any time. At the same time, in view of the importance of the responsibilities of political affairs officials, in order to implement policy guidance for each ministry, it has been decided to hold regular meetings of cabinet ministers and political affairs officials to coordinate and integrate general national policies and the policies of each ministry, so as to achieve close contact between the cabinet, each ministry, and the entire nation.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association Completed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association, in order to promote vigorous national movements, carefully considered the reform of the Association's organization, and the plan has been approved. Its new lineup and personnel were announced on the 21st. In order to fully utilize the Association's affairs, a new Propaganda Headquarters has been established. The basic structure of the new organization is as follows: ○ The system of three bureaus and twelve departments has been changed to one office, one headquarters, two bureaus, and twelve departments. ○ The Propaganda Department has been expanded and a new Propaganda Headquarters has been established, with three departments under it: Propaganda, Culture, Mobilization, and Investigation. ○ A new Air Defense Department has been established in the National Movement Bureau. ○ In order to promote the active utilization of general affairs, five committees have been newly established: Morale Boosting, Military Production Increase, Food Security, Group Public Opinion, and they are responsible for the administration of general affairs. ○ The system of the Reform Affairs Bureau has been reformed.</p>
<h3>Air Raids on Truk and Marshall Islands</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Presents Airplane Donations to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Zhejiang Province Iron Donation Committee has raised airplane donations and previously remitted 2,000,000 national currency to the Central Government, and has been commended by the National Government. It is now learned that the Committee yesterday continued to send representatives to present 4,000,000 national currency in donations from various counties to the Central Government. The funds from the counties that have not yet paid are also being urged by the Committee.</p>
<h3>Investigating the Qualifications of Financial Institution Leaders, Ministry of Finance Orders Associations to Provide Opinions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – In recent years, many financial institutions organized as limited liability companies have been established in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. Some have insufficient capital or poor management. Once the market experiences tight money, they are inevitably in trouble. The current chairmen and managing directors are responsible for their duties and cannot arbitrarily shirk their responsibilities. A reporter specially interviewed a person in charge of the Ministry of Finance about this matter, and was told the following: Recently, it has been found that when companies and firms in various places elect chairmen and managing directors, most of them are experienced and dedicated to their duties, but there are also some who are unqualified, fill the positions without merit, or hold multiple positions and have empty reputations. Once an accident occurs, they refuse to take responsibility and remain at large, which is extremely hateful. In view of the fact that similar situations have occurred in both Nanjing and Shanghai, the Minister, after careful consideration, has ordered the bankers and trust companies in various places to notify their members to quickly provide a list of the current chairmen and managing directors, including their educational background, experience, place of origin, age, current address, and permanent address, and attach the minutes of the meeting where the directors and supervisors were elected. The lists should be sent to the associations for detailed investigation, and the associations should provide their opinions in writing, listed in batches, and submitted to the Ministry for verification. Those who are re-elected or appointed after October 1 of this year should be handled by the companies and firms in the same way, with a guarantee from the associations, and directly submitted to the Ministry for verification, in order to assign responsibility and prevent malpractice.</p>
<h3>Listen to the Opinions of Chinese Intellectuals</h3>
<p>The only way to fundamentally improve Sino-Japanese relations is for both parties to be able to frankly and sincerely confide in each other. To resolve the current extremely complex situation, flattery, ridicule, or abuse will not help. We must urge the Chongqing regime to thoroughly awaken to the mistakes of its anti-Japanese war and its policy of following Britain and the United States, but we will not simply curse them for the sake of pleasure! We should not simply support the National Government with superficial praise. In other words, we must criticize what should be criticized and warn what should be warned. This frank attitude is what constitutes real cooperation and support. At the same time, we must have the magnanimity to listen humbly to the sincere and frank opinions and hopes of Chinese people. As a matter of fact, even if we can speak without any scruples about China, isn't China's speech about Japan quite polite? Therefore, we should go a step further and give Chinese intellectuals the opportunity to boldly and frankly express their own beliefs.</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Zhang Shaochang's article [Respectful Advice to Chinese and Japanese Patriots] published in the *Shen Bao* recently, is also welcomed because of this point of view. Mr. Zhang summarized the reason why the Sino-Japanese problem has not been resolved as the lack of a word [trust], and analyzed the reasons for the lack of [trust] in three points: ○ Ignoring the will and strength of the people. ○ Since the Incident, there have been many sincere people among the peace movements on both the Chinese and Japanese sides, but there are also many who are solely seeking personal gain. ○ There are still places where the Japanese government's statements on China have not been fully realized. Regarding the question of how the Sino-Japanese problem should be resolved, Mr. Zhang also discussed it separately from the two points of [China and Japan should work together] and [China and Japan should work hard from their respective positions]. That is, he hopes that the Japanese side should strive to gain the trust of the Chinese people with facts and improve its attitude and understanding of China. This is not only something that Japanese intellectuals should do, but also something that the entire Japanese people should thoroughly understand.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Shaochang repeatedly emphasized that Japan should fully implement its statements on China and earn the trust of the Chinese people with facts as the most effective way. However, we would like to point out the following two points: ○ Some of the China policies promoted by Japan can only be realized after the full realization of peace or after the end of the Greater East Asia War. ○ Even if we only consider the facts that Japan has practiced in the past, we cannot absolutely express doubts about the truthfulness of the countermeasures and ethical policies. However, we are pleased to hear such frank hopes from Mr. Zhang, a Chinese person. Mr. Zhang raised the word [trust] as the standard for Sino-Japanese relations, and wrote that he was greatly moved by a scene in a Japanese movie where Saigo and Katsu were talking, and expressed the resonance that the Sino-Japanese problem should also be resolved with this spirit. Indeed, whether it is a problem between individuals, groups, or countries, to solve the complicated relationship between China and Japan today, it is only necessary to have a frank magnanimity that can accommodate everything, transcend minor interests or opposition, and cooperate sincerely with each other, so that it can be helpful to the facts. The reason why the Chongqing regime has not approached Japan so far is less about opposing Japan's policies than about the incompletion of the word [trust]. This is something that Japan must deeply consider. In short, no matter what, in the future we should go a step further and promote Chinese intellectuals and patriots so that they can frankly express their thoughts and inclinations. (Translated by Ōkawa from the September 22nd editorial of the *Continental New Daily*)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in the Border Area of Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces Have Approached Wuzhou and Captured Deqing, a Key Point on the Right Bank of the Xijiang River</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, Japanese troops in the border area of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces approached Wuzhou on the 20th, and the city is now in a dangerous situation. According to the *Daily Telegraph*, the Chongqing military authorities have admitted that the purpose of the current Japanese operation is to cut off the Chinese mainland. One unit of the Japanese army has reached a point 60 kilometers from Guilin, and another unit has arrived 5 kilometers northeast of Wuzhou from the Leizhou Peninsula. Due to the above facts, the land transportation connection between Hainan Island and Hong Kong has been opened for 140 kilometers.</p>
<p>South China Front, 22nd (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese army in Guangdong wiped out parts of the defeated Chongqing 159th and 156th Divisions in the Sihui and Zhaoqing areas, they advanced to Deqing, a key point on the right bank of the Xijiang River (about 80 kilometers upstream from Zhaoqing), on the evening of the 20th. The vanguard unit on the left flank and rear broke through the stubborn resistance of the Chongqing army, rushed into the city at 11:00 PM on the same night, and began a mopping-up operation. The main force of the Japanese army also continued to rush into the city and safely occupied it. Deqing is the location of the headquarters of the Chongqing 35th Army Group and is the vanguard defense of Guangxi for the Chongqing army. Therefore, the fall of this place has great military significance.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Releases Battle Situation Communiqué</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Chongqing dispatch: The Chongqing Headquarters issued a battle situation communiqué at 21st afternoon as follows: The Japanese army advancing along the Xiang-Gui Railway is currently being intercepted by the Chongqing army approximately 15 kilometers northeast of Xing'an on the 19th. Another team of the Japanese army advancing northwest from Xinxing in eastern Guangdong arrived near Yunfu on the 19th. The Japanese army advancing southwest from Xindu arrived 15 kilometers northeast of Wuzhou. Chongqing is currently intercepting this Japanese army. The battles around Shiqing, Hunan, became fierce on the 20th.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing Military Affairs Commission announced on the 21st that the Japanese army continuing to advance along the Xijiang River had approached 6 *li* northeast of Wuzhou on the 19th and released the battle situation as follows: ○ The battle outside Wuzhou has become more intense. The Japanese army advancing via roundabout from the east is now attacking the area of Dapo Cen and Longgutang. The Japanese army advancing from the northeast has arrived on the east bank of the Zishui River and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. ○ The Japanese army advancing south from the Xiang-Gui Railway has already engaged in battle near Jieshou on the northern border of An. The Japanese air force bombed Xing'an on the 20th. ○ On the Xijiang front, the Japanese unit advancing westward from Lubuqian and arriving at Deqing remained stationary until the 19th, and the battle situation has not changed.</p>
<h3>Guilin is About to Unfold a Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch – The main force of the Japanese army in the border area of Hunan and Guangxi provinces occupied Quanxian County and then continued south along the Xiang-Gui Railway. They are now approaching Xing'an, a key point near Guilin, and have launched close combat. On one side, the Japanese army occupying Daoxian County in southern Hunan continued west, attacking Guanyang, 50 kilometers south of Quanxian County. Another unit of the Japanese army advancing south, controlling Yongming and Jianghua, formed a posture to capture Guilin from the east. At the same time, the Japanese Southern Army echoed this and launched an offensive from Guangdong Province, with its elite troops occupying the key point of Zhaoqing. The troops that captured Huaiji have broken into Xindu, and Guilin in Guangxi Province is under great threat. At present, the Japanese armies north at Yongming and Jianghua and south at Huaiji and Xindu are only 140 kilometers apart. Currently, both sides are adopting an encirclement posture, and the offensive and defensive battles are becoming increasingly fierce. Foreign reporters in Chongqing are paying great attention to this strategic posture and the surprising progress of the Japanese army. They stated that the Japanese army's operation to cut across the Chinese mainland has a gap of only 140 kilometers left, acknowledging the rapid progress of the Japanese army and the seriousness of the situation. The enemy's retreat after the division of the mainland is inevitable, so their optimistic theory has become a bubble again. The Chongqing-American Allied Forces, seeing this situation, were extremely embarrassed. Chennault, the commander of the US Air Force, who had loudly called for [scorched earth bombing of Japan," finally had to destroy the Guilin air fortress, which they had painstakingly completed, and retreated to Liuzhou, preparing for a final resistance. The Chongqing military authorities have strictly ordered to defend Guilin to the death, evacuated all citizens, actively rushed to build fortresses, and stepped up defenses. According to the Chongqing *Ta Kung Pao*, the Chongqing army is currently reinforcing the area with large armies. Chiang Kai-shek may recently transfer the mechanized American-style Chongqing army fighting on the northern Myanmar and Yunnan fronts to the Guangxi area for combat, mixing them with the American ground forces that have recently arrived in Chongqing. As a result, the decisive battle on the Chinese front will unfold with Guilin as the center.</p>
<h3>Restoration of Security in Zhaoqing</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from the Southern Front, 22nd: After the Japanese army captured Zhaoqing on the 16th, the city's security was immediately restored, and the market is becoming increasingly prosperous. The citizens particularly admire the strict discipline of the Japanese army. It is said that before the capture of Zhaoqing, local supplies had been completely moved to the interior, and all citizens had been evacuated. However, after the Japanese army entered the city, they found that many citizens were still present, and much of the supplies had not been moved. On the second day after the Japanese army entered the city, the market reopened, and the citizens seemed to be cooperating with the Japanese army. The reasons for this situation are, firstly, that the purpose of the Japanese army in this operation is to destroy Britain and the United States, and secondly, that the people have deeply understood the true intention of the Japanese army's announcement that the Chongqing army, if it does not resist the Japanese army, will also be friendly.</p>
<h3>Chiang Kaishek Preserves His Direct Clique's Power</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Guangzhou, 22nd: According to reports from Chongqing, Chiang Kaishek recently issued strict orders to the garrison commanders of Guilin and Liuzhou to defend their respective garrison areas to the death. The largest air force bases in southwestern China, Guilin and Liuzhou, were already in frequent danger before the Japanese army's attack, which Chiang himself admitted. However, Chiang knew that it was impossible to defend these two places, but he still made the Guangxi army resist the Japanese army, in order to make the Guangxi army suffer heavy casualties and preserve his direct clique's power. In the past, it was not uncommon for those who were held responsible for defeats to be sentenced to death, such as Zhang Deneng, the commander of the Fourth Army and garrison commander of Changsha, and many other generals. Now that the Guangxi army has been forced to carry out hopeless operations, it is undoubtedly destined to repeat the same mistakes, because the Guangxi army will either die in battle or be sentenced to death. It is said that the Guangxi army generals are extremely dissatisfied and resentful of Chiang's cold-blooded behavior.</p>

<h3>Allied Paratroopers Meeting Resistance in Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting at the Rhine River Crossing in Aachen</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 22nd: Since the British Second Army's First Airborne Division landed in the Netherlands, it has been advancing rapidly, dividing into two teams. One is advancing north to cross the Rhine River, and the other seems to be attacking German territory. According to the Associated Press quoting the Supreme Command of the Allied forces, fierce battles are unfolding on bridges between the Ruhr and Rhine rivers.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 22nd: According to the German military authorities, the Allied First Parachute Division that landed in the Aachen area has been forced into a situation of imminent annihilation at the Waal bridgehead, and most of the newly landed reinforcements have also been annihilated. The main force of the Allied First Parachute Division is currently eager for rescue.</p>
<p>Associated Press Dispatch from the Front: American paratroopers who met up with the British Second Army in the Nijmegen area are advancing north after occupying the Rhine bridges to relieve the British paratroopers in Aachen. The Aachen crossing point, supported by the British paratroopers, is a key route for attacking German territory and a crucial link in determining the northern battle situation on the Western Front. Therefore, the focus of the battle has been concentrated here.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 22nd: According to a report from Haitong News Agency: The major battle for the main positions between the Meuse, Waal, and Lek rivers in central Holland has not yet been decided. The British Second Army has advanced to the Waal and Nijmegen areas and has joined forces with the landed airborne troops, but the corridor they have completed is too narrow to be a suitable base for continued operations. The German army is not only continuing to attack the corridor from the sides, but also attacking the airborne troops in Nijmegen. American troops are continuing to provide air support, and they are still able to maintain their positions in Nijmegen. The situation of the British First Airborne Division that landed in Aachen is more difficult. After the German counterattack, part of its forces have been annihilated. If General Dempsey fails to meet up with them soon, they may be completely annihilated. Northeast of Limburg, Holland, the American First Army, under the cover of air force, crossed the Sittard-Heerlen line yesterday and approached the German border, but has not yet been able to cross the border. However, southeast of Heerlen, a large force of American troops has entered German territory and advanced to the northwestern suburbs of Aachen. The German army has taken countermeasures to prevent the American army from encircling the city from the north. In the Aachen-Stolberg-Monschau area, the right wing of the American First Army has not yet been able to regain the initiative it lost several days ago. After the American offensive failed, the German army counterattacked and recaptured several strong bunkers.</p>
<h3>Battle for Remiremont Unfolds</h3>

<h3>Finland Still Unable to Escape War After Signing the Armistice Agreement</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Stockholm, 22nd: Finland fought heroically against the Soviet Union for five years to defend its country, but ultimately it ended in a tragic result. When Finnish Acting Prime Minister Bonde announced the terms of the armistice on the night of the 19th, he said in a sorrowful tone that September 19, 1944, was truly a day of distress in Finnish history. According to reports from Helsinki, when Mr. Bonde announced the terms of the agreement, many citizens of Helsinki shed tears, because the Finnish people had used up their last bullet and fought to their last soldier, but still suffered today's tragedy. After the announcement of the armistice terms, all households in Helsinki flew flags at half-mast, news bulletins were bordered in black, hotels were closed, and the atmosphere of the streets and alleys was filled with tragedy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Swedish morning newspapers of the 20th commented that the armistice treaty was much harsher than expected. According to the treaty, the Soviet Union has built a new dependency on the northern coast of Finland, and the Soviet Union's possession of the Porkkala Peninsula is a fatal blow to Finland. Finland's heroic resistance and careful peace negotiations resulted in a result far from what was truly expected. Finland, due to this armistice agreement, has been reduced to a dependency of the Soviet Union and is about to lose its national independence. Finland has not only failed to achieve actual peace, but also failed to escape the battlefield. Well-informed sources in Stockholm made the following observations regarding the consequences brought about by the Finnish armistice agreement: ○ The Soviet Union will definitely occupy all strategically important areas in Finland that are beneficial to the war against Germany. ○ It is impossible to disarm the Finnish army completely before the German army is completely disarmed, so it must be used to fight against Germany. ○ The German army has strengthened its strategic positions in the north, so the battles between the German and Finnish armies will become increasingly fierce, and therefore Stockholm will inevitably suffer from the war.</p>
<h3>Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Stockholm, 21st: According to a report from Haitong News Agency: The Finnish government announced a cabinet reshuffle yesterday, with Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Castren being appointed as Prime Minister to succeed Hackzell, who recently fell ill in Moscow.

The Municipal Goods Allocation Office specifically announced the reasons for the price change yesterday, stating that the price adjustment for allocated bread was made in response to repeated requests from the Bread Group of the Canned Food Industry Association. The reason given was the sharp increase in the cost of bread. Each bag of flour can be used to bake 60 pounds of bread, and the cost has increased from 1,368 yuan to 1,978.50 yuan. Therefore, they requested a re-examination. After repeated and careful consideration by this office, it was deemed that the request to adjust the allocated sales price was not unreasonable, and it was approved to set the sales price at 35 yuan per pound, so that both producers and sellers can achieve fair and reasonable supply and demand.</p>

<p>Suzhou Sojourners' Elementary School in Shanghai Allocates Funds to Establish</p>
<p>[Hometown Love Scholarship] Begins Registration</p>
<p>The Readers' Scholarship Office of this newspaper received a letter yesterday from Zhou Wei-shi, Chairman of the Board, and Zi Yu, Principal of the Suzhou Sojourners' Elementary School in Shanghai. To show their care for fellow villagers, they have specially allocated 150,000 yuan from the tuition fees they have collected. They have requested that this newspaper allocate 50,000 yuan for scholarships, combining for a total of 200,000 yuan to establish a [Hometown Love Scholarship]. Impoverished children who have not yet enrolled can enter the school at any level, limited to 100 students. The funds will be used for scholarships, and all students will be exempt from fees, which is a very thoughtful arrangement.</p>
<p>The original letter stated: [To whom it may concern, our school was established by the Suzhou Sojourners' Association in Shanghai. Since its founding, it has been operating for 50 academic terms. Children of fellow villagers from Suzhou are always given preferential treatment with tuition fee exemptions. Recently, due to the economic depression, many children from impoverished families have been forced to drop out of school because they cannot afford tuition fees. It has been a month since the summer vacation started, and many have not yet paid tuition and enrolled, which proves their genuine poverty and inability to afford it. Otherwise, who would not love their children and allow them to drop out of school? In view of this, and to care for fellow villagers, we plan to allocate 150,000 yuan from the tuition fees to establish a [Hometown Love Scholarship] for 100 students. We kindly request your esteemed organization to oversee the management of this scholarship. Children of fellow villagers from Suzhou at the elementary school level who have not yet enrolled can apply for the scholarship from the 20th of this month until the end of the month. After approval by your organization, they can be sent to our school to continue their studies. This endeavor has been greatly supported by your newspaper, and you have agreed to allocate 50,000 yuan for the scholarship, making a total of 200,000 yuan as the scholarship fund. This will surely benefit our fellow villagers greatly. We also request you to oversee the application procedures. We are grateful for your cooperation.] (Note) The school is located near Xinzha Road and Datong Road. Suzhou elementary school students from impoverished families living near the school who wish to enroll should fill out an application form at the office for submission.</p>

<h3>Procedures for Special Rice Allocation for Public and Private Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau, in conjunction with the Goods Allocation Office, is handling special allocation for teachers and staff.</p>
<p>The Education Bureau has carefully formulated and officially announced the registration procedures. All registration matters are limited to the end of this month. The details are as follows: ○ For public and private primary and secondary schools in this city applying for special rice allocation for teachers and staff, the principal should first obtain an application form from the Municipal Goods Allocation Office. After filling it out in detail according to the format, they should also prepare three copies each of the following two lists: (A) Teachers and Staff Roster: ○ Name, ○ Native Place, ○ Age, ○ Gender, ○ Position, ○ Concurrent Schools, ○ Address, ○ Citizen Certificate Number, ○ Remarks. (B) Employee Survey Form: ○ School Name, ○ School Address, ○ Telephone, ○ Principal's Name, ○ Number of Teachers and Staff, ○ Number of Students, ○ Number of School Workers, ○ Total Number of Employees and Students, ○ (Remarks) Create the lists on ten-column paper according to the format. Fill them out and submit them to the Education Bureau for review along with the application form. (If schools have already submitted two copies each of the Teachers and Staff Roster and Employee Survey Form in the past, and there have been no changes in staff or personnel, they only need to fill out and submit one copy of the lists). ○ All schools must submit the aforementioned Teachers and Staff Roster and Employee Survey Form to the Bureau by the 30th of this month. Late submissions will be considered a voluntary waiver of the right to apply for allocation. ○ Private primary and secondary schools that are not registered or were registered before the Incident but have not obtained a registration certificate from this Bureau should have the principal bring the first set of forms and their citizen certificate to the Bureau for a meeting before the 30th of this month.

<h3>Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses in America's Planned Attack on Philippines is Unlikely to Succeed, Minister Matsushima Said Yesterday</h3>
<p>Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet's Press Department in China stated yesterday (22nd) at 2:30 PM, during a routine meeting with Chinese journalists in this city, that the enemy Americans have suffered severe blows from the Japanese military in the Pacific, incurring heavy losses. He also explained the purpose of the Japanese military's operations on the mainland, which is to destroy the British and American forces behind the Chongqing faction. A record of the conversation is as follows:</p>
<h3>Japanese Operations Successful on the Mainland</h3>
<p>The Minister first stated that, according to a Lisbon dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 20th, the enemy's South Pacific Commander, Nimitz, announced that the 14th Air Force had abandoned the Guilin airbase and was cooperating with the American forces in the Pacific. This situation demonstrates the success of the Japanese military's operations on the mainland. It also reminds us that Wenzhou, along the coast, has been occupied by the Japanese military. Therefore, the enemy American's intentions were thwarted before they could be realized by the Japanese military. Recently, the enemy Americans had only about 600 aircraft in Chongqing. Since continuous and fierce attacks by the Japanese air force, there has been no increase. It is expected that the enemy American air force will soon be destroyed. In particular, the 20th Air Force is unable to operate sufficiently due to a lack of fuel. Moreover, their airbases have been under pressure and have been moved northwest. In the future, based on the progress of the Japanese military, the enemy American air force in Chongqing will face even greater difficulties. Furthermore, the Japanese army and navy air forces on the mainland have recently seen a particularly surprising increase. New cutting-edge fighter planes, renowned as the world's best, have appeared on the mainland. Therefore, no matter how much the enemy exaggerates its propaganda, it is expected that the enemy's plans will be completely shattered soon.</p>
<h3>Enemy American Assault on the Philippines is Unlikely to Succeed</h3>
<p>Next, regarding the situation in the Pacific theater, he said that on Peleliu Island, north of the Palau Islands, the enemy's Third Fleet has been fighting continuously and exhaustingly since September 15th. As of the 19th, the enemy's losses included 8,700 dead and wounded, as well as one cruiser, two destroyers, one submarine, one minesweeper, one large transport ship, and one other ship. In addition, there were more than 61 landing craft. On the 18th, the enemy Americans sent a 10,000-ton large warship to collect the wounded. In the past, during the battle of Saipan Island, after 40 days of hard fighting, they announced casualties of 10,000 personnel. However, compared to the area of Peleliu Island, which is only one-third the size of Saipan Island, they have already suffered such heavy losses after only four days of hard fighting. Therefore, comparing it to the battle of Saipan Island, the enemy's losses have been more than ten times greater due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese military. As a result, the enemy Americans have announced that the resistance of the Japanese military in the battle of Peleliu Island is unprecedented in history and has resulted in unprecedentedly huge losses. Currently, the enemy American operations in the South Pacific are attempting to attack the Philippines from both Peleliu Island and Halmahera Island, forming a triangular posture with the Philippine Islands. The enemy has suffered heavy blows from the Japanese military around both islands, incurring heavy losses. When the enemy Americans initially attacked Saipan Island, their forces consisted of three divisions. Now, with only two divisions, they have already suffered severe losses. Therefore, the enemy's attack on the Philippines will not be easy. Minister Matsushima further stated that Anguar Island has always been an uninhabited island, and the American soldiers based there are sure to suffer from uninhabited island .</p>
<h3>Airdropping Supplies to Chongqing is Extremely Difficult</h3>
<p>The Minister continued that since the visit of enemy Americans Nelson and Harley to Chongqing, a meeting with the Chongqing faction decided that they would use air routes to supplement the Chongqing faction with a large amount of military supplies. We now see that the enemy American production is currently particularly difficult. Opening up air transport routes to aid Chongqing will be just empty words. In particular, the enemy Americans consider the B-29 aircraft to be very important, but they are unable to replenish them. Therefore, it is very difficult to aid Chongqing by air. The Minister then addressed the recent Chongqing political conference, where Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech containing the phrase "turning defeat into victory and turning danger into safety." The Minister said that it is impossible for the Chongqing faction to turn defeat into victory, especially after recently losing Hengyang and other places. Chiang's optimism relies on the situation in Europe and the assistance of the British and Americans to Chongqing, and he believes in China's destiny. However, in light of the current situation, Chiang's remarks are contrary to the reality. Even if Chongqing can complete a victorious "War of Resistance," it will not be a victory for Chongqing. If they achieve victory by relying on the power of the British and Americans, it is questionable whether the British and Americans will recognize Chongqing as one of the victorious nations. The current situation of operations against Chongqing is completely different. The purpose is not against Chongqing and China, but to attack the British and American forces behind Chongqing. From the beginning of the Sino-Japanese Incident, Japan's aim was also to fight against the British and American forces behind Chiang in Chongqing. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the purpose has remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Enemy American Atrocities are Outrageous</h3>
<p>After the Japanese military occupied Changsha and Hengyang, the enemy American air force constantly and blindly bombed innocent civilians, causing great suffering to the general public who were unable to return home. The enemy Americans are extremely cruel and barbaric. Their attempt to destroy the dreams of the people of East Asia is despicable and no different from Jewish tactics. For example, when Japanese women were evacuated from the Palau Islands, they encountered an enemy American submarine that surfaced and cruelly strafed them with machine guns, laughing and making merry. Furthermore, in a recent advertisement in Chicago, USA, recruiting Marine Corps members, they openly declared that it was hunting season, with the Japanese as the hunting target and the Chinese as their watchdogs. Their contempt for the people of East Asia is outrageous.</p>

<h3>[Santonin] Poisoning Symptoms</h3>
<p>Recently, general commercial advertisements often promote certain medicines or candies, all with Santonin as the main ingredient... They specialize in treating children's ailments, making the weak strong, driving out worms, eliminating indigestion... and other effects. In fact, Santonin does not have the functions of stimulating appetite, lubricating the intestines, or promoting growth. It is only a reliable vermifuge. If children often take such preparations, even in small amounts, it can accumulate and cause poisoning and other adverse effects. Moreover, it is now autumn, and many children are sick due to improper diet, especially with typhoid fever (enteric fever), dysentery, gastroenteritis and other diseases being the most common. Here are its effects and poisoning symptoms, respectively:</p>
<p>Santonin: Also translated as Sandu Ren. Vermifuge.</p>
<p>Efficacy: Mainly used to expel roundworms, but also used for pinworms and whipworms.</p>
<p>Principle: Santonin is easily absorbed, and after absorption, it transforms in the body. The transformation products are excreted in the small intestine, paralyzing roundworms, etc., thus achieving the effect of expelling worms.</p>
<p>Poisoning Symptoms: If Santonin is absorbed by the body, it can often cause yellow vision (i.e., everything seen is yellow) and olfactory and taste hallucinations even within the medicinal dose. If taken in large quantities, it will show a decrease in body temperature, blurred consciousness, facial muscle and masticatory muscle contractions. Severe cases will cause convulsions throughout the body, leading to a coma, and death due to respiratory arrest. Or Santonin can cause nephritis, excreting proteinuria and hematuria. In addition to acute poisoning, prolonged use of Santonin can cause visual hallucinations, yellow vision, olfactory hallucinations, and loss of consciousness. In chronic poisoning, even if medication is stopped, the symptoms are not easily eliminated. See pages 314-315 of Pharmacology, Vermifuges.

<h3>Thunderstorm (6)</h3>
<p>March arrived quickly.</p>
<p>The weather seemed to be making up for the lack of charcoal, and the wind was gentle and the sun was warm. Although the Women's Festival on the third day of the third month was cloudy, the early-blooming peach blossoms deeply felt it was a bright spring.</p>
<p>[Recently, the great achievements of the special attack squad will be announced. Prepare to draw like this!]</p>
<p>After Lieutenant Colonel Tobita gave this order, Ryuufu felt a joy that words could not describe. His long-cherished wish from two months ago was finally about to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>But in Lieutenant Colonel Tobita's voice, and in his expression, there was an excessive depth. Ryuufu, who was emotionally excited, did not notice this, and hurried back to his room. Then Lieutenant Colonel Tobita shouted loudly from behind:</p>
<p>[Hey, you...]</p>
<p>[Huh?]</p>
<p>Ryuufu turned around and saw the teary-eyed Lieutenant Colonel staring at him.</p>
<p>[It's not about official business...]</p>
<p>The Lieutenant Colonel suddenly turned to the side and started working.</p>
<p>Ryuufu went back like this.</p>
<p>Just as he was thinking about the outline, he suddenly felt that the material was insufficient. Because the special submarine belonged to confidential matters, it was impossible to know the full details. However, to give a slight hint, he had to consult with a member of the Naval General Staff to discuss the structural content of the drawing.</p>
<p>After returning home from the Naval General Staff, he began to carefully read the returned draft announcement.</p>
<p>--Believing in the imperial power and divine assistance, the special attack squad, on a certain day of a certain month, went on a journey with a bit in their mouths. They sailed directly to Pearl Harbor and, with calm and skilled piloting, broke through the enemy's tight and complex underwater security net. All the squad boats entered the port according to plan and either launched a daytime raid or boldly carried out an unprecedented feat. After completing the mission, they ended their lives together with their boats. Among them, an Alison-class battleship was sunk during a night attack, which was clearly visible to the friendly Japanese units outside the harbor. At 4:31 PM on December 8th (Hawaiian time, 9:01 PM on December 7th), two minutes after the moon rose in Hawaii, a violent explosion occurred in Pearl Harbor, flames soared into the sky, and sparks and iron pieces danced in the air. In an instant, the flames were extinguished. At the same time, the enemy mistakenly thought it was an attack by the Japanese air force and began to fire intense anti-aircraft artillery into the sky. Also, at 6:11 PM on the same day (Hawaiian time, 10:41 PM), a radio report stated that one special attack boat had successfully attacked. After 7:14 PM, radio reports were cut off. At this time, they either automatically sank or were sunk by bombing. (Omission)</p>
<p>--At the time of departure, they were instructed to return to the team immediately after the attack ended, (omission) but all the team members regarded death as home and focused on maximizing the attack effect, and did not have any intention of returning to the team in their minds--</p>
<p>[How brave and heroic!]</p>
<p>Ryuufu read aloud. Then he thought of the submarine school in Kure. Such great achievements, such sinking of fearless enemy battleships, finally the Japanese Empire's submarine, which had worked hard for forty years, opened a bright and brilliant flower. Thinking of this, he could not help but shed tears. (144)</p>
<h3>The Educational Characteristics of the Former Municipal Council Chinese Schools by Ueno Taichu</h3>
<p>○ Students Never Participate in Any Extracurricular Activities</p>
<p>The students seem to deeply believe that culture and politics must be separated, and they are even less willing to use school students as political tools. No matter what commemorative gatherings, parades, or other group activities there are, they never go outside of school to participate, completely ignoring the chaos raging outside and continuing to attend classes as usual. It is difficult for any outside ideological trends to enter the gates of the Chinese schools. They only study and attend classes. If it is said that schools are a microcosm of society, they do not seem to think so. Not only are they like this towards the outside world, but even among the Municipal Council's schools, there should be a brotherly relationship, but they are never seen holding a joint sports meeting, entertainment show, or lecture...or any assembly for performances or competitions. In 1934, there was a small-scale physical education performance by the four elementary schools and one girls' school. Also, in 1938, for the tenth anniversary of the Chinese Education Department, selected student achievements were exhibited from various elementary schools, and demonstration teaching was conducted—this can be regarded as unprecedented and unrepeatable.</p>
<p>○ Students' Career Paths</p>
<p>Due to the different locations of the schools, the students' career paths also vary. Generally, graduates near industrial and commercial areas are more likely to find employment or become apprentices (elementary school) than to pursue further education. Conversely, in schools in residential areas, more students pursue further education. What is most noteworthy is that if we assume that secondary education is general education—its career paths should be broad, not narrow—then the future prospects of the students of the Chinese Public School are exactly the opposite. Although there are certainly those who cannot enter the University of Hong Kong or Cambridge University but enter various universities in China, this seems to be an unconventional path in the view of the Chinese Middle School itself. In reality, Chinese Middle School graduates are mostly seen in customs, post offices, foreign firms, banks, and various departments of the Municipal Council. If a precise statistical analysis of the personnel in the aforementioned places is made, it will surely reveal very interesting records.</p>
<p>(6) Administrative Characteristics</p>
<p>In a broad sense, school administration should refer to all methods related to running a school, but what is discussed in this article only refers to the school's administrative system and various points related to policy implementation. A brief description is given below.</p>
<p>○ No Easy Changes</p>
<p>Administrative measures are never easily changed. In other words, once a method has been implemented, if there is nothing particularly inappropriate about it, a conservative attitude is taken rather than making active improvements. Some may say that this kind of measure inevitably lacks the spirit of experimentation, but in terms of teaching methods, it is not seen as rigidly adhering to conventions or being out of step with the times. (There has been significant development in elementary schools' research on teaching methods; see Elementary School Teachers' Magazine, Volume 3.) Perhaps this is the traditional British attitude of prudence, where all measures are taken to avoid giving the impression of sudden changes. For example, the grading standards, regulations for rewards and punishments, examination rules, auditorium and classroom conventions, and the five-day school week have all been in place for decades under unwritten rules, with few changes. As for the transfer of school personnel, the assignment of duties, teaching facility policies, and the school's relationships with various parties, all are maintained according to precedent and remain as before. In short, all administrative measures, whether good or bad,</p>
<p>○ The Principal's Task</p>
<p>In addition to the principal, the Chinese Middle School does not have positions such as Director of Teaching Affairs, Director of Discipline, or Director of General Affairs. There are only Chinese and Western assistants (the Chinese assistant was added in 1933 with the board of directors' approval, and is externally referred to as the Vice-Principal). In elementary schools, there is only one senior teacher (Director of Teaching Affairs), and no other directors. It is not known whether this is to facilitate achieving the standard of integrating discipline and teaching, so the Director of Teaching Affairs also handles disciplinary duties, or whether there are other reasons. But in any case, the power of the middle school principal is relatively particularly large, and it can be said to be a centralized principal system. There are no collective meetings, no specialization of duties, and no statistical tables hanging on the walls. Therefore, the quality of the principal can immediately influence the fate of the entire school. As for the elementary school principals, although their work is busy, some administrative matters have been comprehensively planned by the Chinese Education Department, so their responsibilities are lighter. In addition to handling daily administrative matters, they focus on the task of guidance, such as classroom inspections, arrangement of the school environment, participation in meetings and group activities, guidance of children's activities, guidance and assessment of actual teaching, etc.</p>
