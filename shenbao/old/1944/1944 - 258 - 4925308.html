<h3>懇談本市縣區現狀以後的感想</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>本市市政諮詢委員會，爲明瞭本市所屬各縣區地方實況，昨午在滬招待一二兩區行政督察專員曁各縣縣長，席間除暢聆各縣實況報告外，並充分交換意見。我也參與其間，爰將懇談後的感想，抒述如次：　　過去，我們對於本市所屬七縣樹立模範區一點，深致殷切期待。我們的意見，認爲七縣是本市市區的外圍，外圍不安，市區自然不能獨安。外圍的一切上軌道後，才能改變上海近郊的惡劣環環，才能保衛整個上海的治安。我們並在市政機關實施合併之前夕，會對促成七縣模範區提出四點方針，第一，確立各縣區的行政制度。第二，健全各縣區的行政人事。第三，整理各縣的財政收支。第四，維護各縣區的治安。這次與各縣實際行政當局懇談的結論，以治安與財政爲兩大難題。治安不能確立，財政就難獲整理之實效，而財政不能充裕，治安就難如理想之確立，治安賴經費以確立，財政賴保障而徵收，兩者實具密切的聯繫性，必須相提並論，同時解決。　　就各縣治安方面而言，一般的說，今年的情形，比較去年更爲嚴重，因爲物價屢漲，生活費用益高，而擔負治安任務的保安隊與警察的待遇，則過於菲薄，例如保安隊每人月餉僅三百五十元並米三斗，警察月餉九十元並米二斗半。一個保安大隊的辦公費每月只有一千五百元，而實際上至少十萬元，當地的供應巨款尚在外。而在效率方面，則每中隊人數不足，槍械不足，保衛力量極爲薄弱。縣長原兼保安大隊長，但徒有兼名，而無指揮之實權。所以，名義上各縣軍政職權是一元的，但事實上，行政權與保衛權是分離的。　　就各縣財政方面而言，因爲治安不能確立，財政稅款不能收足，一部分爲游匪所刧奪，藉可永久立足，實爲治安不能確立之最大障礙·公務員待遇亦嫌太薄，科員月薪不過二千元左右，個人生活尚難維持，不足以言養廉。而縣公署每月辦公費尤不敷遠甚，規定只有四千元。例如南匯縣公署一月開水費一項，即需六千元（南滙大都飲天落水），預算與實支距離太遠。　　其次，如教育經費尤爲貧乏，事變前約佔行政費總額百分之二十，現在只有百分之七。最近自四月份以後，教育經費尚未領到。各縣封鎖管理所有百弊而無一利，其害甚於釐金，防匪不足而擾民有餘。聞各封鎖口之檢問所職員人品不齊，有南市賭台人員在賭台停閉後前往任事者，人事複雜可以想見了。　　上面所述缺點，自應急謀補救，約言之，第一確立治安，第二整理財政。入手方法，首須提高縣長職權，最近由區公署改爲縣治後，各縣縣長職權尚未確立劃分，市府各局處前在各區設置機關應即裁撤，合併縣署，使縣長有名實相符的整個治權。其次，各縣財政收入，應以用之於當地爲原則，上海市區財政實際上並不需要取之於各縣，反之，應每年指定的款補助各縣治安教育建設等必要經費。　　最後，尚有很多地方實況未便在此發表，亦非我們所能想像。今後我們尤須認清必先強化外圍，市區才獲眞正安寗。而以上海市的地位如不能確立治安，就不必談和平區的治安，更不必侈談協力大東亞戰爭。我們今後不必高談理論，應注重實幹。現在兩區專員及各縣縣長均表示各就本職而努力，那末，只須市政當局領導得法，市民給以充分協助，則七縣成爲模範區固可指待，而整個上海市成爲全國模範區，亦不致無望的。</p>

<p>東京十七日中央社電　中部太平洋日軍某基地十七日電：培里琉島日軍部隊，自十五日夜半再猛擊佔據該島西南端之敵軍，敵軍其後逐漸增強兵力，其中一部侵入該島飛機塲，現正在激戰中。又敵軍企圖在培里琉島登陸之兵力預料約有一師團，駕有戰車一百五十輛，迄十六日止，日軍所獲戰果，除傷害敵軍五千一百十人外，並擊沉敵登陸用舟艇六十艘，又使敵日是３戰車五十輛起炎或破壞。　　東京十七日中央社電　據中部太平洋基地十七日電：帛琉羣島北端海面，於十六日上午突有行動中之敵巡洋艦一艘，誤觸機雷，當發生大爆炸，旋即沉沒。</p>

<h3>華南日軍突攻入肇慶現分三路進擊桂林</h3>
<p>廣州十七日中央社電　據華南前綫日軍基地訊，向西江地區猛進之日軍精銳部隊之一部，十六日晚突入渝第三十六集團軍根據地肇慶，市內刻正掃蕩殘敵中。　　東京十七日中央社電　日軍精銳快速部隊，佔領廣西屏藩桂林前衛之全縣後，更沿湘桂鐵路一路南下，其他方面各部隊，亦分別由新寗道縣兩方面，一齊急速進擊，現在廣西日軍進攻部隊，正向桂林作怒濤之進擊。據渝廣播稱，渝軍事發言人，十五日會見記者時，已承認全縣失陷。進攻新寗之日軍，於十三日發表，於廣西境佔領資源之經過如次：日軍沿湘桂鐵路南下，中央部隊於十二日佔領全縣，右翼部隊於十二日攻陷新寗，次日（十三日）抵達資源。左翼部隊則自零陵南下，進至道縣，日軍戰綫長達八十公里，乃至一百公里，刻廣西方面之日軍亦開始新行動，雷州半島方面，亦再度展開小規模之戰鬬云。</p>

<h3>常寧南方渝軍敗</h3>
<p>南京前綫十七日中央社電　日軍部隊刻以第四戰區爲目標，勇猛急進，敵四十四師爲擾亂日軍後方，特呼號奪回常寗（衡陽南方六十公里）會於九日左右，進至常寗南方地區，然常寗方面之日軍部隊，則於十一日指曉，待敵軍纔行集合，便作先發制人之攻擊，戰至深夜，合圍猛攻，使渝軍大亂，向南方敗走云。</p>

<h3>反軸心軍深入齊格斐防綫亞琛城東南鏖戰中</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　德國社訊，軍息，特里爾（Ｔrier在德境西南部，鄰近盧森堡）之西北，已越過棗爾河而向比特堡前進之美軍，已與德軍發生激烈之接觸戰。美軍於亞琛之東南及南方結集陸空部隊，斯托爾堡之南已發生激戰，德軍予反軸心軍以重創。反軸心軍於哈塞爾特·瑪斯特里克及梅茲地區中集中實力，將於各該區發動新攻勢。　　又訊：據德官方戰報稱：亞琛地區美軍之攻勢，已被遏阻。　　里斯本十七日中央社電　西歐反軸心軍最高司令部十六日發表：美第一軍先鋒部隊繞回亞琛，進至齊格斐綫，同時該司令部並力謂是項美軍，尚未達至完全突破該線之地步。</p>
<h3>荷西南部德軍撤退</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　海通社訊：自弗郎特沿海至荷蘭西南部之全部德軍，均已撤退完畢，僅若干後衛部隊仍於利俄波蘭特運河一帶，抗阻反軸心軍之前進。緊迫之加拿大第一軍，尚不致強渡寬闊之些耳德河口，而將移其主力至亞爾培運河與些耳德河會合之處，如此則安特衛晉與亞琛聞之反軸心軍，乃能集中於一處，否則該處之英第二軍及美第一軍頗難集中進攻萊茵區之工業地。連日之戰門中，美軍校英軍獲得較多之進展。</p>
<h3>東綫北路德軍防禦戰成功</h3>
<p>華沙局勢亦好轉　　柏林十七日中央社電　海通社訊：拉脫維亞大戰之第一日，蘇軍雖在數處突入，然德軍之防禦戰亦獲得極大之成就。蘇以大軍四十師，希望一舉擊潰里加之德北路軍，然已歸失敗。蘇軍自馬靴形之地帶內發動攻勢，企圖驅逐德軍至里加灣而殲滅之，現蘇軍無論包抄與正而進攻均無進展。德軍保有龐大之生力軍，足以遏阻蘇軍之攻勢，突入德防綫之蘇軍正遭殲滅中，預料波羅的海地區之戰事，仍須賡續至數日之久。華沙東北局勢亦好轉，拉特齊明橋頭堡已無蘇軍先鋒之踪跡，德軍破壞維斯杜拉河之橋梁，防止敵自普拉加突入華沙·巴斯基特山隘東麓激戰未已，德軍肅清薩諾克南之敵軍，並殲克洛斯諾南之敵軍後，蘇軍又於週五來犯，當被逐退。</p>
<h3>甬公路已正式通車</h3>
<p>杭州十七日中央社電　杭甬公路爲浙東西交通要道·事變以後，破頭不堪，各縣因經費困難·漠不關心，交通工具又感缺乏，致迄今未能恢復，一般旅客咸　滬由航綫爲惟一往來之路徑。最近航輪減少，旅客因此更感不便，故對於該公路恢復交通之要求，尤爲迫切。前次杭州當局會邀集巨商·籌資三千萬金，組織公會。現浙第六區行政督察專員公署，正請華中鐵道公司當局協助，在他區內撥借客車五輛，卡車一輛，業已正式通車。</p>
<h3>議和首席代表芬外長赴蘇京</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十七日中央社電　德國社訊：芬外長恩克已啓程前往莫斯科，就芬蘭休戰代表團首席代表，此事已由芬政界人士予以證實。</p>
<h3>土任命新外長親蘇態度顯明</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　海通社訊：土耳其前外長曼里卓格魯，於二月前辭職後，茲已由總統任卡加爾氏爲新外長。前外長乃中立政策之擁護者，辭職以來，對德國關係日劣。土總統於任命新外長之前，極願等待局勢之發展，故命總理薩拉卓格魯暫攝外長之職。自巴爾幹局勢劇變，蘇軍迫近土國近界後，土政府之親蘇態度遂益肯定。土政府深願與蘇成立新協定，然談判已於月初破裂，是否能有圖滿結果，殊難逆料。</p>
<h3>奎貝克會議結呸英美發聯合公報</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　海通社訊：羅斯福邱吉爾於奎貝克會議後，聯合發表之公報，會於昨日美京之報道會議中宣讀。內稱，[羅邱二人未能肯定發表歐戰結束之日，歐戰之結束必在太平洋攻勢發動之前，關於太平洋之攻勢，羅邱亦未能有所陳述，總之此次會議之決定，對於歐亞戰事進行之任何一點，均有關係。]又據合衆社電稱，邱吉爾首相正式允許於歐戰結束之後，派遣英國陸海空軍參加太平洋之戰。奎貝克會議後之公報又稱，太平洋戰區總司令之設立，會中並未論及，太平洋戰我遼闊，不如分區設立指揮爲佳。此次奎貝克會議　，與會諸人態度這誠勢，爲歷次會議冠。此次公報僅述軍事問題，未涉政治事件。　　里斯本十七日中央社電　德國社訊，奎貝克官方昨日宣布：英首相邱吉爾已決定自奎貝克返　敦，其餘問題將留俟　　，再擇地舉行談判，首　未返國前之行蹤，將秘而不宣。羅斯福總統之行動亦將保守秘密，以前會傳邱吉爾於奎貝克會議結束後，將訪問華盛頓。</p>
<h3>反軸心國安全會議英美蘇會談結束</h3>
<p>日內瓦十七日中央社電　德國社訊，據紐約消息：在鄧巴頓奧克斯舉行之反軸心戰後安全會議，關於英美蘇三國代表之會議，業已於星期三結束。至英美渝三方代表之會議，則將於下星期中開始。英首席代表賈德幹爵十，已赴奎貝克向邱吉爾首相報告會議之結果。</p>
<h3>義北阿亨城巷戰熾烈</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　傳美第一軍在阿　北部，與德軍巷戰。</p>
<h3>從蘇聯歸來</h3>
<p>德蘇戰爭係就俄國人民之民族的能力與制度的強靱性加以歷史的實騐。俄羅斯人神經的　橫，耐苦力，服從性等的民族性，在第一綫的壕溝中，激烈的巷戰中，及後方的國民生活中，經三年餘的戰爭，而顯露無遺。且政治的粗綫條作風，無恥蠻橫，瑣細的果斷實行等諸性格，亦完全纍露。　　希特勒軍隊一旦越過國境而開始進軍蘇境後，揭起了對侵略的擁護正義與自主之戰的旗幟，與英美金融資本握手，並派遣外交使節，接近波蘭，捷克，南斯拉夫，希臘等聯合小國。蘇聯外交的縱橫椑闔，當德軍迫近莫斯科郊外六十公里的一九四一年十一月六日，即革命紀念日前夜的大會中，史太林就大呌：[於是敵所企圖的反蘇十字軍之組織，圖於失敗了，]</p>
<h3>親擋頭陣的史太林氏</h3>
<p>戰爭勃發後不數日，國家防衛委員會的組織即予發表。那是掌握軍權，政權一切絕對權的獨裁機關，史太林氏在其領袖的地位上，負起了戰爭指導的最高責任，而立於其批判最前面。即史太林氏自戰爭一發生後即暴露其全身於國民與世界之前。　　蘇聯自戰爭勃發後，即　如次的緊急措置，作爲戰時經濟對策。　　一，資材，勞働，財政全部實施改換，展開完全的戰事經濟。　　二，將企業並勞働者從東方撤退，另在新地點儘量設法速即開始工作。　　三，在東部地方急圖農業生產的迅速發展，以補足西部地方暫事喪失領土的打擊。　　四，在企業經營之根本的改善上，展開具有軍事意義的企業之經營改善，並展開爲強化勞働法規的門爭。　　報紙上這樣說：出於蘇維埃經濟的計劃性及政治的果斷實行，始能實行。蘇聯報童頗引爲自绔。</p>
<h3>產業向東遷移</h3>
<p>從平時產業轉向戰時經濟—勞働力的動員，勞働規程的強化等，任何交戰國當然應須實行。在蘇聯政府方面，戰爭勃發後不滿二·三個月，即能予以實施。且企業並勞働者向東方轉移的蘇聯手段，深堪注目。一方面進行大規模的戰門，絡續運輸軍隊及兵器赴第一綫，鐵道運輸儘量在完成這件巨大的工作，同時另一方面則將增大的工廠設備與勞働者向內地轉移，這實是一件偉大的工作。人類尚未實騐過。　　柴浦洛奇飛機工廠，在德軍到達杜尼泊爾河右岸時，其撤退物的貨車，堆如山積，而在日內，完全運赴東方。列寗格勒初包圍以後，主要的另件均用飛機運輸。敵人迫近莫斯科郊外時，有幾百家工廠在伏爾伽與島拉爾之間，島拉爾與中央亞細亞的列車上面，一直到如疾風般殺來的德軍，進迫到工廠附近時，當在繼續工作，直至在最迫促的事態下，方才火速拆卸最急要機械，裝在汽車和船上，運向東方，當時的情形，這蘇聯報上的記載躍然紙上。與敵第一綫部隊接觸的時候，趁千鈞一發的時間撤退的工廠，怎樣在新的地方佈置呢？（翔譯自八月廿一日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>公會消息</h3>
<p>○餅饅樂　上海特別市餅饅油燴號業同業公會，近有一部份會員擅將大餅油熗售價提增，該會昨日派員分赴各區向各該會員關切勸告，值茲統配機構一元化之際，且粉麩統構一元化之際，且粉麩統配處正派員調查各業主要商號所當麵粉，同業務應忍耐，不作越軌行動，以免各界物議。　　○營業廠業　本市營造業同業公會於前日下午三時假西藏路寗波同鄉會舉行改選大會，到各機關代表會員二百餘人，由主席報告該業過去一年業務情形後，並改理監事。　　○烟葉業　本市菸葉業同業公會定於明日（十九日）下午二時，假座西藏路寗波同鄉會二樓舉行常年會員代表大會，並改選理監事云。</p>
<h3>一週市況</h3>
<p>滬市金融與工商各業市況，上週間大致均在平穩中盤旋，惟一般人心仍以國際情勢變化爲觀點，故黃金以供過於求，市價回跌甚鉅。紋銀平市，股票則以頭寸軋緊，且中秋節關屆邇，賣多買少，行情較前週減低，進吸乏人，各業市況平中見昂，大都因電力限制關係，工廠生產率減少，致購藏日用物資者繼續不斷，故市價難見抑低，希望有關當局，加以密切注視云。</p>
<h3>法商電車依然漲價不顧當局法令</h3>
<p>本市前第八區法商電車公司罔顧法令，擅於十五日起私自漲價，照原價增一倍有半，致刺激一般物價之扶搖上漲，輿論譁然。市公用局鑒於公用事業之重要，特發令制止，詳情已誌昨報。中央社記者昨爲此事，又親往實地調查，乃該公司所屬各綫車輛票價，依然漲價發售，置功令於不顧，市民生活於腦後，實屬肆無忌憚，深盼當局昨更進一步之斷然處置，以維政府威信，而蘇民困。</p>

<h3>Thoughts After a Candid Discussion on the Current Situation of Cities, Counties, and Districts</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>The Municipal Advisory Committee of this city, in order to understand the local situation of the various counties and districts under its jurisdiction, hosted the administrative inspectors of the First and Second Districts and the county magistrates of each county at noon yesterday in Shanghai. During the meeting, in addition to listening to reports on the actual situation of each county, they also fully exchanged opinions. I also participated in the meeting, and I would like to express my thoughts after the candid discussion as follows: In the past, we had deep expectations for the establishment of model districts in the seven counties under this city. Our opinion was that the seven counties are the periphery of the urban area of this city. If the periphery is unstable, the urban area cannot be secure alone. Only when everything in the periphery is on track can the deteriorated environment in the suburbs of Shanghai be changed, and the security of the entire Shanghai can be protected. We also proposed four guidelines for promoting the model districts in the seven counties on the eve of the merger of municipal agencies: First, establish the administrative system of each county and district. Second, improve the administrative personnel of each county and district. Third, reorganize the financial revenue and expenditure of each county. Fourth, maintain the security of each county and district. The conclusion of this candid discussion with the actual administrative authorities of each county is that security and finance are the two major problems. If security cannot be established, the reorganization of finance will be difficult to achieve. If finance cannot be sufficient, security will be difficult to establish as desired. Security relies on funding to be established, and finance relies on guarantees for collection. The two are closely related and must be discussed and resolved at the same time. In terms of the security of each county, generally speaking, this year's situation is more serious than last year because prices have risen repeatedly, and the cost of living has become higher, while the treatment of security teams and police officers who bear the security task is too meager. For example, the monthly salary of each security team member is only 350 yuan and three dou of rice, and the monthly salary of a police officer is 90 yuan and two and a half dou of rice. The office expenses of a security battalion are only 1,500 yuan per month, but in reality, they are at least 100,000 yuan. The huge amount of local supplies is still outside. In terms of efficiency, the number of people in each squadron is insufficient, firearms are insufficient, and the security force is extremely weak. The county magistrate originally served concurrently as the battalion commander of the security team, but only had the title without the actual power of command. Therefore, in name, the military and political powers of each county are unified, but in fact, the administrative power and the security power are separated. In terms of the finances of each county, because security cannot be established, financial tax revenue cannot be collected fully. Some of it is plundered by bandits, which can establish a permanent foothold. This is the biggest obstacle to the establishment of security. The treatment of civil servants is also too meager. The monthly salary of a section member is only about 2,000 yuan, which is difficult to maintain for personal life, and it is not enough to talk about raising honesty. Moreover, the monthly office expenses of the county government are far from sufficient, with a regulation of only 4,000 yuan. For example, the water bill for the Nanhui County Government alone requires 6,000 yuan per month (most of Nanhui drinks rainwater), and the gap between the budget and actual expenditure is too far. Secondly, educational funding is particularly scarce. Before the incident, it accounted for about 20% of the total administrative expenses, but now it is only 7%. Recently, educational funding has not been received since April. The blockade management of each county has all disadvantages and no advantages, and its harm is greater than that of the likin tax, which is insufficient to prevent bandits but more than enough to disturb the people. It is heard that the staff of the inspection posts at each blockade are of mixed character. Some of the personnel from the gambling platforms in the southern city went to work there after the gambling platforms were closed. The complexity of the personnel can be imagined. The above-mentioned shortcomings should be remedied urgently. In short, the first is to establish security, and the second is to reorganize finance. The starting point is to improve the authority of the county magistrate. Recently, after the district office was changed to the county government, the authority of the county magistrates of each county has not yet been established and divided. The agencies set up by the various bureaus and offices of the municipal government in each district should be abolished immediately and merged into the county government, so that the county magistrate has the entire administrative power that matches the name. Secondly, the principle of the financial income of each county should be to use it locally. The Shanghai urban area does not actually need to take it from the counties. On the contrary, it should designate funds every year to subsidize the necessary expenses of each county for security, education, and construction. Finally, there are still many local situations that are inconvenient to publish here, and that we cannot imagine. In the future, we must recognize that only by strengthening the periphery first can the urban area obtain true peace and security. If Shanghai's position cannot be established, there is no need to talk about the security of the peace zone, let alone lavishly talk about cooperating in the Greater East Asia War. We should not talk about theories in the future, but focus on practical work. Now that the commissioners of the two districts and the county magistrates of each county have expressed their efforts in their respective positions, then, as long as the municipal authorities lead properly and the citizens give full assistance, it can be expected that the seven counties will become model districts, and the entire Shanghai will become a national model district, which is not hopeless.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues at the Southwestern End of Peleliu Island, Enemy Casualties Reach 5,000, and 60 Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese military base in the central Pacific reported on the 17th: The Japanese troops on Peleliu Island have been fiercely attacking the enemy forces occupying the southwestern end of the island since midnight on the 15th. The enemy forces have gradually strengthened their forces since then, and some of them have invaded the island's airfield, where fierce fighting is currently taking place. It is expected that the enemy forces attempting to land on Peleliu Island are about one division, driving 150 tanks. As of the 16th, the Japanese military's achievements, in addition to injuring 5,110 enemy soldiers, also included sinking 60 enemy landing craft and setting fire to or destroying 50 enemy tanks.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a central Pacific base on the 17th: A moving enemy cruiser suddenly struck a mine in the waters off the northern end of the Palau Islands on the morning of the 16th. A large explosion occurred, and it sank immediately.</p>
<h3>Enemy Landings on Palau and Morotai</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - A powerful American mobile unit has appeared in the waters west of the Western Caroline Islands since the 6th. American air forces have also been carrying out large-scale bombings of Palau, Yap, Halmahera in the Moluccas, and various parts of the Philippines for days. At dawn on the 15th, American forces used 40 transport ships, large and small, to approach within 15 kilometers of Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands. Around 6:00 a.m., they released landing craft and amphibious tanks to approach the shore. Then, around 8:00 a.m., they boarded about 300 landing craft and rushed straight to the southwestern shore of Peleliu from the front of the atoll, and began landing operations all at once. When the vanguard of the American landing force reached the atoll area, several boats and amphibious tanks struck laid mines and were immediately sunk, causing temporary chaos. After reorganizing their forces, they attacked the shore. Before and after the landing, the American mobile unit used fierce naval artillery fire to bombard the area around Peleliu and used a large number of naval aircraft to bomb and cover the landing operation. The Japanese garrison on the island took advantage of the landing of the American vanguard around 8:00 a.m. to launch a fierce ambush near the coast for about two hours. Around 10:00 a.m., they had completely repelled the landing force of about one division. Around 2:00 p.m., the American forces attempted to land again using a large number of landing craft, but were repelled due to the Japanese army's fierce attack near the coast. However, the American forces still sent a group of amphibious tanks to force a landing, and fierce fighting is currently unfolding in the area near the coast. It is difficult for the American forces to continue to carry out fierce naval artillery fire and bombing like rain in that area, but the Japanese garrison is still fighting bravely with strong fighting spirit. As for Morotai Island north of Halmahera Island, American forces also landed on the south coast on the morning of the 15th around 8:00 a.m., under the cover of a powerful mobile unit, with more than 50 small transport ships. The Japanese troops on the island are currently carrying out an ambush with a small number of troops, but some of the American forces have secured a base on the south coast.</p>

The Japanese army intercepted them over Anshan and on the enemy's return route, and carried out the first bombing of the enemy base in Chengdu, inflicting heavy damage. (B) The Chongqing airfields in Changsha, Xiangtan, and Lingling are now being used by the Japanese army, so air combat in that area is often favorable to the Japanese army. ○[South Pacific area], (A) An enemy mobile unit has appeared near the Western Carolines since the 6th, echoing the troops at its New Guinea base, and carrying out air raids on Yap Island, Palau Islands, Moluccas Islands, Celebes Islands, and various parts of the Philippines.

Around the 9th, they advanced to the area south of Changning. However, the Japanese troops in Changning launched a preemptive attack at dawn on the 11th, waiting for the enemy to gather before attacking. The battle lasted until late at night, with encirclement and fierce attacks, causing the Chongqing army to be in great disarray and flee southward.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Launches Strong National Movement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso explained the six major decisive battle measures at the 85th Diet session and is actively preparing to realize them. Now, the Japanese government has launched a strong national movement in order to thoroughly implement these measures and to unleash the maximum determination of 100 million people. For example, State Minister Ogata has taken office as Vice President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. The recent changes in the leadership of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and various movement groups, as well as the reorganization of the lineup of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society's new President Kobayashi, are all manifestations of the Japanese 100 million people launching a national movement to win. The concrete direction of the movement is currently being carefully considered.</p>
<h3>Graduation Ceremony Held at Pharmaceutical Training Institute</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - Fifty-seven students from the seventh and eighth classes of the Nanjing Pharmaceutical Training Institute held a graduation ceremony at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Peace Hall at 9:00 a.m. on the 17th. Chairman Chu Minyi delivered a speech.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Forces Advance Deep into Siegfried Line, Fierce Fighting Southeast of Aachen</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: American troops northwest of Trier (Trier, located in southwestern Germany, near Luxembourg), having crossed the Saar River and advancing towards Bitburg, have engaged in fierce combat with German troops. American forces are concentrating land and air forces southeast and south of Aachen. Fierce fighting has broken out south of Stolberg, with German troops inflicting heavy casualties on the Anti-Axis forces. The Anti-Axis forces are concentrating their forces in the areas of Hasselt, Maastricht, and Metz, and will launch new offensives in each of these areas. Furthermore, German official war reports state that the American offensive in the Aachen area has been contained.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Supreme Headquarters of the Anti-Axis Forces in Western Europe announced on the 16th that the vanguard of the American First Army had bypassed Aachen and advanced to the Siegfried Line. At the same time, the headquarters emphasized that these American forces have not yet completely breached the line.</p>
<h3>German Troops Withdraw from Southwestern Netherlands</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Maritime News Agency reports: All German troops from the coast of Flandre to southwestern Netherlands have completed their withdrawal. Only some rear guard units are still resisting the advance of the Anti-Axis forces along the Leopold Canal. The pressing Canadian First Army will likely not attempt to cross the wide Scheldt Estuary, but will move its main force to the confluence of the Albert Canal and the Scheldt River. This will allow the Anti-Axis forces to concentrate in Antwerp and Aachen, otherwise it would be difficult for the British Second Army and the American First Army there to concentrate their attack on the industrial area of the Rhineland. In the fighting of recent days, American and British forces have made more progress.</p>
<h3>German Defensive Battles Successful on Northern Sector of Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Situation in Warsaw Also Improves</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Maritime News Agency reports: Although Soviet forces broke through in several places on the first day of the battle of Latvia, the German defensive battle has also achieved great success. The Soviets, with a large army of forty divisions, hoped to defeat the German Northern Army at Riga in one fell swoop, but have failed. The Soviet army launched an offensive from within the horseshoe-shaped area, attempting to drive the German army to the Gulf of Riga and annihilate it. Currently, the Soviet army has made no progress whether through encirclement or frontal attack. The German army retains a large and vital force sufficient to contain the Soviet offensive. Soviet troops who have broken through the German defense line are being annihilated. It is expected that the battle in the Baltic region will continue for several days. The situation northeast of Warsaw has also improved. There is no sign of the Soviet vanguard at the Raczymin bridgehead. The German army destroyed bridges over the Vistula River to prevent the enemy from breaking into Warsaw from Praga. Fierce fighting continues east of the Baskieter Pass. After clearing the enemy south of Sanok and annihilating the enemy south of Krosno, the Soviet army attacked again on Friday but was repelled.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Highway Officially Open to Traffic</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway is a vital transportation route in eastern Zhejiang. After the incident, it was in a state of disrepair. The counties were indifferent due to financial difficulties and a lack of transportation. As a result, it has not been restored to this day. The general public considers the Shanghai route as the only way to travel. Recently, the number of sailing vessels has decreased, making it even more inconvenient for travelers. Therefore, the demand for the restoration of traffic on the highway is particularly urgent. Previously, the Hangzhou authorities invited wealthy merchants to raise 30 million gold to organize a guild. Now, the Administrative Inspectorate of the Sixth District of Zhejiang is requesting the assistance of the Central China Railway Company to allocate five passenger cars and one truck from other districts. It has now officially opened to traffic.</p>
<h3>Finnish Foreign Minister, Chief Negotiator for Peace Talks, Heads to Soviet Capital</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: Finnish Foreign Minister Enckell has departed for Moscow as chief negotiator for the Finnish armistice delegation. This has been confirmed by Finnish political figures.</p>
<h3>Turkey Appoints New Foreign Minister with Clear Pro-Soviet Stance</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Maritime News Agency reports: Turkish former Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu, who resigned two months ago, has now been replaced by President Inönü with Mr. Kacar as the new Foreign Minister. The former Foreign Minister was an advocate of a neutral policy. Since his resignation, relations with Germany have deteriorated. The Turkish President was very willing to wait for the development of the situation before appointing a new Foreign Minister, so he ordered Prime Minister Saracoğlu to temporarily serve as Foreign Minister. Since the dramatic changes in the Balkan situation and the approach of Soviet troops to the Turkish border, the Turkish government's pro-Soviet stance has become more definite. The Turkish government is eager to conclude a new agreement with the Soviet Union, but negotiations broke down earlier this month. It is difficult to predict whether it can have a satisfactory outcome.</p>
<h3>Quebec Conference Concludes, Britain and America Issue Joint Communique</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Maritime News Agency reports: The joint communique issued by Roosevelt and Churchill after the Quebec Conference was read yesterday at a press conference in Washington. It stated that [Roosevelt and Churchill could not definitively announce the end of the European war. The end of the European war must come before the launch of the Pacific offensive. Regarding the Pacific offensive, Roosevelt and Churchill also failed to state anything. In short, the decision of this conference is related to any point in the progress of the European and Asian wars.] According to the Associated Press, Prime Minister Churchill officially agreed to send British land, sea, and air forces to participate in the Pacific War after the end of the European war. The communique after the Quebec Conference also stated that the establishment of a commander-in-chief of the Pacific Theater was not discussed at the meeting. The Pacific war zone is too vast, and it is better to establish command by region. The attitude of the people attending this Quebec conference was more sincere than in any previous conference. This communique only described military issues and did not involve political events.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports that the Quebec government officially announced yesterday that British Prime Minister Churchill has decided to return to London from Quebec, and the remaining issues will be left to the future. The location for future negotiations will be selected. Before returning home, the Prime Minister's whereabouts will be kept secret. President Roosevelt's actions will also be kept secret. Previously, it was rumored that Churchill would visit Washington after the Quebec Conference.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Security Conference, British, American, and Soviet Talks Conclude</h3>
<p>Geneva, 17th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports, according to a New York dispatch: The conference on post-war security among the Anti-Axis powers held at Dumbarton Oaks, regarding the meeting of British, American, and Soviet representatives, concluded on Wednesday. The meeting between British, American, and Chongqing representatives will begin in the middle of next week. British Chief Representative Sir Alexander Cadogan has gone to Quebec to report the results of the meeting to Prime Minister Churchill.</p>
<h3>Intense Street Fighting in Aachen, Northern Italy</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - Reports that the American First Army is engaging in street fighting with German troops in northern Aachen.</p>
<h3>Returning from the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>The German-Soviet war is a historical experiment on the Russian people's national capacity and the strength of their system. The Russians' nervous endurance, tolerance of hardship, obedience, and other national characteristics have been fully revealed in the trenches of the front lines, the fierce street battles, and the national life of the rear, through more than three years of war. In addition, the political style of crude lines, shamelessness, and the meticulous implementation of resolute decisions have also been fully exposed. Once Hitler's troops crossed the border and began their advance into Soviet territory, they raised the banner of defending the righteousness and autonomy of aggression, shook hands with British and American financial capital, and dispatched diplomatic envoys to approach small allied countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Greece. The Soviets’ diplomatic maneuvering was such that, in the meeting on the eve of the anniversary of the revolution, November 6, 1941, when German troops were pressing within 60 kilometers of Moscow's suburbs, Stalin shouted: "Thus, the enemy's attempted organization of an anti-Soviet crusade is doomed to failure!"</p>
<h3>Stalin Personally Takes the Lead</h3>
<p>Within days of the outbreak of war, the organization of the State Defense Committee was announced. This was a dictatorial organ that held all absolute power over military and political affairs. Stalin, in his position as its leader, assumed the supreme responsibility for directing the war and stood at the forefront of its criticism. In other words, Stalin exposed himself fully to the nation and the world immediately after the outbreak of the war. After the outbreak of war, the Soviet Union immediately implemented the following emergency measures as wartime economic countermeasures. 1. All materials, labor, and finance were completely transformed to launch a complete wartime economy. 2. Enterprises and laborers were withdrawn from the east, and efforts were made to quickly start work in new locations. 3. A rapid development of agricultural production was urgently planned in the eastern regions to compensate for the temporary loss of territory in the western regions. 4. In terms of fundamental improvements in enterprise management, efforts were made to improve the management of enterprises with military significance and to strengthen labor regulations. Newspapers say that this was made possible by the planning of the Soviet economy and the decisive implementation of policies. The Soviet newspapermen are quite proud of this.</p>
<h3>Industry Moves East</h3>
<p>The transition from peacetime industry to a wartime economy – the mobilization of labor, the strengthening of labor regulations, etc. – are of course what any belligerent country should implement. The Soviet government was able to implement these measures within two or three months of the outbreak of war. Moreover, the Soviet method of transferring enterprises and laborers to the east is worthy of close attention. On the one hand, large-scale battles were being fought, and troops and weapons were continuously transported to the front lines. The railway transportation system was doing its utmost to complete this enormous task. At the same time, increased factory equipment and laborers were being transferred to the interior. This was truly a great undertaking, something humanity had not yet experienced. When German troops reached the right bank of the Dnieper River, the freight cars loaded with evacuation materials from the Cha Pulochki aircraft factory were piled up like mountains, but within days, they were completely transported to the east. After the initial encirclement of Leningrad, the main components were transported by air. As the enemy approached the outskirts of Moscow, hundreds of factories were on trains between the Volga and the Urals, and between the Urals and Central Asia. Even as the German troops advanced like a whirlwind, workers continued to work in the factories until, in the most urgent situation, they hurriedly dismantled the most essential machinery, loaded it onto trucks and ships, and transported it eastward. The records in the Soviet newspapers vividly depict this scene. How were the factories that were evacuated in the nick of time, even as they came into contact with the enemy's front-line troops, to be set up in new locations?

<h3>Construction Youth League Holds Symposium</h3>
<p>The Chinese Construction Youth Team held a symposium in commemoration of the Xinhai Revolution. It was held at the Da Ke Le Cafe on Nanjing Road at 3 pm yesterday (17th). The team invited Mr. Yamada Junzaburo, an old friend of the Father of the Nation during his lifetime, to talk about the cause and spirit of revolutionary youth. More than 30 people from the press and cultural circles in this city attended.</p>
<h3>Municipal Ferry Gaogiao Line Resumes Service Today</h3>
<p>Since the suspension of the municipal ferry service last month, residents of Gaogiao, Donggou, Qingning Temple, and other places have felt inconvenienced. They jointly petitioned the relevant authorities of the municipal government to resume service as soon as possible to facilitate transportation. After learning of the situation, the Municipal Public Works Bureau ordered the Municipal Ferry Company to resume service as soon as possible. After more than a month of preparation and negotiation, the company complied with the order and first restored the route between Shanghai and Qingning Temple on the 15th of this month, and decided to resume the ferry service between Shanghai and Gaogiao today (18th).</p>
<h3>Public Association News</h3>
<p>○Cake and Steamed Bread Industry The Shanghai Special City Cake and Steamed Bread and Fried Food Industry Association recently found that some members have arbitrarily increased the selling price of sesame cakes and fried dough sticks. The association yesterday sent personnel to various districts to express concern and advise the members. At a time when the unified distribution mechanism is being implemented, and at a time when the unified distribution of flour bran is being implemented, and the Flour and Bran Distribution Office is sending personnel to investigate the flour owed by major merchants in various industries, the industry should be patient and not take any out-of-bounds actions to avoid criticism from all sectors. ○Construction Industry The Shanghai Municipal Construction Industry Association held a re-election meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Xizang Road at 3 pm the day before yesterday. More than 200 representatives of various agencies and members attended. After the chairman reported on the industry's business situation in the past year, the directors and supervisors were re-elected. ○Tobacco Leaf Industry The Shanghai Municipal Tobacco Leaf Industry Association is scheduled to hold its annual members' representative meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Xizang Road at 2 pm tomorrow (19th), and will re-elect directors and supervisors.</p>
<h3>Weekly Market Conditions</h3>
<p>The market conditions of Shanghai's financial and industrial and commercial sectors generally revolved around stability last week. However, people's minds are still focused on changes in the international situation. Therefore, the supply of gold exceeded demand, and the market price fell significantly. The price of silver was flat. Stock prices were lower than the previous week due to tight funds and the imminent Mid-Autumn Festival, with more sellers than buyers and a lack of demand. Market conditions in various industries were stable but rising. This was mostly due to the impact of electricity restrictions, which reduced factory productivity, leading to a continuous demand for daily necessities, making it difficult to suppress market prices. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will pay close attention to this matter.</p>
<h3>French Tram Company Still Raises Prices Despite Authorities' Orders</h3>
<p>The French Tram Company in the Eighth District of this city disregarded the law and arbitrarily raised prices by 150% of the original price on the 15th, which stimulated the soaring of general prices, causing public outcry. The Municipal Public Works Bureau, in view of the importance of public utilities, issued an order to stop the price increase. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency personally went to the field to investigate this matter and found that the fares of all lines of vehicles belonging to the company were still being sold at increased prices, ignoring the official orders and the people's livelihood. This is truly reckless. It is hoped that the authorities will take further decisive measures to maintain the government's credibility and alleviate the people's suffering.</p>

<h3>A Letter</h3>
<p>— Li Shiyu</p>
<p>Comrade XX County: I am delighted to learn of your appointment as County Magistrate and offer my deepest congratulations. If we were to meet, as usual, I should say, "Congratulations, congratulations!" You have been promoted, especially to be the "Hundred League Marquis" County Magistrate. I don't know why I should congratulate you; it seems I should express my joy without being mundane! In fact, congratulations and joy are in order. No one wants to be an official in Beijing. A local official, a "parent of the people," a County Magistrate, in the old days of the Qing Dynasty, could not be appointed unless he was a successful candidate in the imperial examinations. Since the Republic of China, which person with connections does not want to get a County Magistrate position? In recent years, the situation in the counties has been very complicated. Good people cannot do it, and bad people cannot do it well, creating a chaotic situation that confuses people's minds. Now, the central government is raising the authority, status, and treatment of County Magistrates, setting qualifications for County Magistrates, assessing the performance of County Magistrates, and increasing county funding, all of which show the importance attached to county administration. The value of County Magistrates seems to be rising again. You, old friend, have been frustrated for a long time and often complained. Now you can be considered to have emerged from the crowd. I am sure that you will have a new achievement when you can put your talent to use. I will wait and see! To put it bluntly, I have high hopes for you. You are now a "new noble," and your social engagements must be very busy! In the past, each bureau and section, and even each division, of the Provincial or Municipal Government wanted to "take advantage" of the new County Magistrate. When a new County Magistrate is announced, everyone will scramble to find out his background. If your connections are not strong, you will still be treated the same way. If you don't "buy it" — invite them to dinner or send gifts — then you will be in trouble. Perhaps you will run into walls everywhere. Your official business will either be delayed for a while or deliberately find fault and be "rejected." They always think that the County Magistrate has ways, and in fact, they really do have ways. Everyone taking a little oil is not a big deal, but unknowingly this creates a cause-and-effect relationship for the County Magistrate to find ways. In order to socialize, or rather, to cope, you have to find ways. Otherwise, the budget will not be approved, and the report will be rejected, and you will not be able to bear the suffering! It is strange that a County Magistrate with flexible hands and eyes has no way of getting things done. "Spending money to get things done" really forces people to do bad things. I am not teaching you to do the same. Although this is a common thing in the past or present, it is best if we can not go along with the crowd and create a unique example. I know that you did not use capital to get your position as County Magistrate. I hope you don't have to pay those taxes to the checkpoints, don't invite them to dinner, and don't send gifts, so as not to squeeze the people again. As for those bureaus and sections, you can be polite to them. If you are clean as water and work hard, they may be embarrassed to extort you. If you scrape and exploit a lot, then don't blame them for wanting to take advantage. Who doesn't want to take advantage of oil, to be specific, the County Magistrate thinks it is painful to deal with the environment, and people also think it is painful, but if you are a clean official, you are not afraid of being difficult for others. If you are a corrupt official, don't blame others for making things difficult for you. I hope that Lao Shi will be honest and just, and work hard on construction. Obstacles are imaginable. To break obstacles, don't compromise. You will definitely break through all difficulties and achieve light. I am not unaware of the environment, but I am saying some irresponsible things. In fact, the more you compromise with the environment, the more difficult it will be to get through. There are two paths in front of you: one is to go along with the crowd, and the other is to be tough and do things toughly. Which way to go is up to you! The environment in the counties is also very bad now, but it also depends on human effort. I often hear County Magistrates say that it is difficult to deal with certain teams and agencies, and there are many restrictions. In fact, it is not entirely true. As far as I know, most of them are self-inflicted. Since ancient times, "people who respect themselves will be respected by others" and "people will regret themselves before others regret them." If the County Magistrate maintains his dignity and does not do things that are despised by others, they will naturally respect you. I have seen County Magistrates who are very pretentious and arrogant, traveling in cars, going in and out with bodyguards, calling it socializing, and always deducting military rice, always adding surcharges to the land tax, not repairing roads, suspending schools, and always extorting a lot from the people when they encounter lawsuits. There are even more ugly things that we cannot imagine. These things cannot be hidden from the eyes and ears of the world. What teams and agencies are not blind or deaf? They can see and hear, so how can they look up to you! Alas, they have lost the face of the Chinese people, and they are still cursing others for being wrong. God knows, if you do bad things and still want to avoid being criticized, and still want people to allow you to proceed smoothly, how can there be such a good deal! Old friend, when you take office, you must maintain your dignity, and people will look up to you. If you want them not to interfere with you, you can only do everything well, so that they have no way to criticize you. You can also make an agreement in advance: we all have common goals, we all have common rules, and we all have a common understanding of the truth. We jointly abide by the rules, obey the truth, and move towards the common goals. For example, ensuring public security, increasing production, and rectifying thoughts. We are on the road to construction, not being selfish and wholeheartedly working hard, working as a County Magistrate for the advancement of county administration, not working as a County Magistrate to get rich. If we can work diligently and selflessly, even if we encounter difficulties, we will try to overcome them. If it is really impossible, we would rather leave than continue to live shamelessly. There will definitely be a day when it will work. I offer you the principle of dealing with them. You must be tough, tough enough not to conflict, and you must be gentle, gentle enough not to lose your position. Scholars can be killed but not humiliated. Don't lose the demeanor of a great citizen. I guarantee that you will get through it, or even get their respect and cooperation! There are also those local bullies and gentry, who are also obstacles to the implementation of county administration. Throughout the history of various counties, there have been many factions among the gentry and merchants. When a new County Magistrate comes, he is either surrounded by one faction or surrounded by another faction. They threaten and entice you, putting you in a trap, selling out the interests of the people, and destroying your reputation. They profit from it. This is all because the County Magistrate took advantage and was fooled. They are extremely bad. They let you eat your fill, and then they pull you down. That is, they wait until you have evidence of corruption, and then they threaten you, use your weaknesses, and do whatever they want. At that time, you will become their prisoner, listening to their manipulation. Friends, do you still remember the slogan "Down with the local bullies and gentry" during the Northern Expedition? The words are still in our ears. Now, "where there is land, there must be bullies, and where there is gentry, there must be badness." There is a proliferation of local bullies and gentry in the counties. How should the revolutionary comrades who have become County Magistrates deal with this? Collude with them or overthrow them? Please weigh the matter carefully! Speaking of construction, there are really myriad aspects, which cannot be described in detail in a short letter. I think there is a prerequisite issue that should be noted, that is, there should be a plan for the work, and there should be organization and training for the people. This is also a small experience I have gained in my work over the years, and I offer it for your reference. A newly appointed County Magistrate should know the area of this county, how much land there is, how many people there are, what the level of education is, how many people have received certain education, how many have not received education, what the folk customs are, what materials are produced, how much is the financial income, and how much is the financial expenditure. How many schools are there, how many kilometers of roads are there, and even the rivers and mountains should be understood clearly. Then you can plan production and consumption, and engage in various constructions. As for people, whether they are public officials or people, they will not have strength without organization and training. There must be strict organization and strict training in order to exert great power. Before the incident, Jiangxi Province combined education, cultivation, and defense into one, and the officials and people were united as one. The foundation of county administration was quite solid. After the incident, there were many bandits in various counties, and it seemed difficult to promote county administration. In fact, it is also a matter of method. May I ask, aren't bandits also good people in the past? Even now, they are not necessarily not good people. I often hear people say "winning the hearts of the people." The hearts of the people are inclined to good governance. If we truly love the people and share their joys and sorrows, do not squeeze them, do not oppress them, and lead them to produce for consumption, sweat for construction, for themselves, for our locality, and for our country, in short, as long as you do not only care about the interests of the County Magistrate and forget the interests of the people, then all the people will not be able to leave you, rely on you, and trust you, and all construction can be completed smoothly. Construction is to determine the methods, steps, and time within the reach of human and material resources, and to plan in an orderly manner. Use organized and trained public officials to be responsible for promoting the people of the entire county. County Magistrates, do not sit in the office only taking care of official business, or attending meetings, or socializing. You should inspect, supervise, and check for errors and omissions, reward and punish clearly, be close to the virtuous and stay away from the bad, and often go to the countryside to live with the farmers. For example, when repairing roads and building bridges, you must personally supervise. You must personally visit schools, and you must also especially promote rural hygiene. National health is very important. Daily necessities from the city should be transported to the countryside without going through merchants. They should be uniformly transported and sold by the public, and the county's raw materials should be exchanged for the city's goods. This can not only facilitate the farmers, but also benefit the city. If the profits are used as various administrative construction expenses, they will definitely be very sufficient. In short, the land of a county, the people of a county, the officials, police, and soldiers of a county, all human and material resources are living and developing in a planned, organized, and trained manner, and of course there will be progress and light. We study local administration and issue publications, aiming to lead practice with theory and use practice to verify and clarify theory. We bring together the County Magistrate comrades who are responsible for actual administration and organize the County Administration Research Committee of our society. I hope you will participate, so I have written a messy set of words, not afraid of being crude, but still feel that there are many things to say. We will talk about it later. Stop writing.
