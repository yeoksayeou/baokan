<p>社評</p>
<h3>農業增產與機構一元化</h3>
<p>戰時必須增加生產，已經是參距國家絕</p>
<p>對的原則，毋庸詞費解釋了。我們中國也是</p>
<p>參戰國家，在理論上，對於增加生產已經定</p>
<p>為國策，去年二月十三日國民政府頒布的戰</p>
<p>時經濟政策綱領中，第一項就是「增加生產</p>
<p>」。今年元旦，汪主席訓詞中，亦以「增加</p>
<p>生產」列為三大工作重點之一。且規定今年</p>
<p>是增產總動員的一年。同時，增加生產的口</p>
<p>號已經普遍在各方面提出，億乎耳熟能詳。</p>
<p>可是，在事質上怎樣呢？我們試加檢討目前</p>
<p>上海的工業和產情形，電力的一再限制，原</p>
<p>料取給的困難，成品運銷的不便，維持原產</p>
<p>量已屬不易，達論增加產量了。上海是全國</p>
<p>工業的中心，尚屬如此，其他各地槪可想見</p>
<p>。況且，中國的工業，限於機械技術，重工</p>
<p>業固無基礎，即輕工業亦甫於戰前數年中建</p>
<p>立基礎，粗具規模，但經變亂之餘，僅此粗</p>
<p>具規模的輕工業基礎，亦受損折，因此，目</p>
<p>前縱使盡量生產，仍不能追踪戰前。</p>
<p>其次，農業方面，因農村情形經變亂之</p>
<p>餘，若干地區復為新四軍所侵擾，未能恢復</p>
<p>正常狀態。一方面統制收購方法，未臻合理</p>
<p>，致使農民抱具畏懼心理，減低耕作興趣。</p>
<p>我們手頭雖無統計數字，足以提出證明，然</p>
<p>從一般情況觀察，則年來農作物產量，也是</p>
<p>有减無增。</p>
<p>理論上對於增加生產固然非常重視，而</p>
<p>事實上對於增加生產的實效，卻成大大的疑</p>
<p>問。然　，誰應負此責任呢？當然，政府居</p>
<p>於領導地位，在積極方面，不能強化領導與</p>
<p>實施的機權，不能依照增產計劃切實執行。</p>
<p>在消極方面，不能排除增產的障礙，又不能</p>
<p>造成增產的環境與條件。而人民僅居於生產</p>
<p>者地位，有了適當強力的領導，譬如一元化</p>
<p>的機構。有了寧死的環境，譬如治安確立。</p>
<p>有了供應的條件，譬如原料供給，技術指導</p>
<p>。那末，增產的實效，不是難於獲致的。</p>
<p>在此決戰時期，增產的目的，當然在貢</p>
<p>獻於作戰，爭取最後勝利。可是，我們始終</p>
<p>認為增產工作是由人民大衆所擔任，必先安</p>
<p>定人民最低限度的生活，然後才能全力以赴</p>
<p>。安定民生最需要的是衣食二者，所以，增</p>
<p>產工作應從食糧棉花入手，其次是麥粉工業</p>
<p>與紡織工業。工業方面姑不置論，僅就農業</p>
<p>方面而言，領導機構的一元化，我們認為是</p>
<p>頗關重要的先決問題。</p>
<p>現在政府中有關農業生產的機構，直隸</p>
<p>行政院的有農業增產委員會，合作事業委員</p>
<p>會，鄉村建設委員會等。其次如實業部的農</p>
<p>林署，建設部的農具製造廠，社會福利部的</p>
<p>農村福利局等。此外，新運會內有關濃村工</p>
<p>作的各單位，靑年工讀團中有關農村工作部</p>
<p>分。以上各機構，任務雖殊而目標則一。</p>
<p>我們主張，為期獲致農業增產的實效，</p>
<p>政府領導農業的機構實有一元化的必要，凡</p>
<p>有關農業的各部分，應予合併，綜合為一個</p>
<p>單位。這單位的任務，領導並實施全國濃業</p>
<p>增產，專設一部，直隸行政院，假定名稱爲</p>
<p>「農業增產部」。是否可行，願朝野共同討</p>
<p>論之。</p>
<h3>大東亞作戰目的在擊滅英美侵略　日本中國派遣軍發表聲明</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　日派遺軍十七日下午三時，發表聲明，茲</p>
<p>錄其原文如下：</p>
<p>實踐道義精神</p>
<p>「大東亞戰爭勃發後，英美在東亞之一切根據地，</p>
<p>喪失殆盡，逃　於東亞之圈外，然仍陰謀險略，於</p>
<p>抗戰之美名下，巧妙懷柔，節絡重慶政權。再伸爪</p>
<p>牙於東亞大陸，逞其制　東亞之野心。我派遺軍</p>
<p>爲完成大東亞戰爭之目的，基於中日同盟條約，奮然而起，擊滅大陸之</p>
<p>一切侵略勢力，以期解放中國國家及民族所受之桎梏，而發動偉大之攻</p>
<p>勢。此次作戰，旣發動號令，全軍軍紀嚴明，實行道義。並告中國民衆</p>
<p>，應各安其居，各樂其業。然兵火所及，民衆之困苦，田野之荒廢，文</p>
<p>物之破壞，我軍深為憂慮，故常限制戰禍於最小限度，同時並盡力從事</p>
<p>復興建設，中國民衆均理解我軍之精神，自動協力而獲美滿之成續，此</p>
<p>在各地有事實證明，毋待贅言。然暴戾之英美，焚燒市街民居，破壞交</p>
<p>通設施，以妨害建設，並蹂躪人民，甚至屠殺無辜民衆，使戰後復興建</p>
<p>設，不得如期完成。查英美以協同之美名，夷中國領士，為自己之戰塲</p>
<p>，念其為他國之領土，不惜夷為焦土，中國民衆之幸福災禍，非彼輩所</p>
<p>關心，其違反人道之獸性，誠為人神所共憤。</p>
<p>擊滅共同敵人</p>
<p>中日兩國以東方道義相合，英美寶爲我人共同之敵</p>
<p>人，帝國政府前於聲明有云：「此我國在中國之軍</p>
<p>事行動，其目的完全在於摧毀敵人英美之侵略野心</p>
<p>，中國民衆固為我友，即重慶軍隊如能排除與英美</p>
<p>之協力，亦非我人之敵人」，日本政府願東亞人相互理解明提携之眞意，</p>
<p>我軍現正遵奉實踐此聲明，以期擊滅東亞之叛逆份十，協助中國之自主</p>
<p>獨立，及四萬萬國民之安居樂業，至於作戰地區及後方之保全安定，目</p>
<p>前暫由日軍負責，此蓋由圖迅速恢復秩序，避免民衆流難困憊，尊重民</p>
<p>意習慣，促進鄉土社會更生之微衷，別無他意。甚望全中國之先知先覺</p>
<p>賢能之士及愛國之靑年志士，洞察中國典亡，世界沉浮之目前嚴重局勢</p>
<p>，為園家百年大計，舉措無謬，促進中日協力，提协奮門，努力完成中</p>
<p>國之自主獨立及統一建國。」</p>
<h3>泰國決全面協力完成大東亞戰爭　新首相阿巴溫初次發表談話</h3>
<p>盤谷十七日中央社</p>
<p>電　泰國阿巴溫新首相，</p>
<p>十六日下午三時於新首相</p>
<p>官邸初次接見日本記者團</p>
<p>，發表談話如次：泰國新</p>
<p>內閣之施政方針，已盡表</p>
<p>明於議會中，本人所發表</p>
<p>之六大政綱內，泰，日兩</p>
<p>國協力，一如六大政　所</p>
<p>述，還守雙方締結之條約</p>
<p>，乃為當然者，其具體方</p>
<p>策，泰國為竭盡全力，協</p>
<p>力日本，遂行戰爭，首應</p>
<p>作經濟之協力。此外，泰</p>
<p>國國民之生活，因戰局之</p>
<p>進展，日漸困難，乃屬當</p>
<p>然現象，泰國國民不得不</p>
<p>對此澈底覺悟，故政府目</p>
<p>下正盡力研究安定民生之</p>
<p>施策。關於物價對策，正</p>
<p>準備以現有之泰國總商會</p>
<p>，華僑總會，印度人商業</p>
<p>聯合會以及日本商會各代</p>
<p>表，組成一張力委員會，</p>
<p>以此為商業之代表機關，</p>
<p>施行合理自主之物價管理</p>
<p>，政府則自旁加以指導監</p>
<p>督。關於振興工業，亦擬</p>
<p>努力振興民間工業，政府</p>
<p>對此則與以技術上之援助</p>
<p>。關於防空　策，為求萬</p>
<p>全，目下正由內務部防空</p>
<p>委員會着手研究適富辦法</p>
<p>中。為獲得世界戰爭東亞</p>
<p>戰爭之勝利，泰國與日太</p>
<p>為同盟國關係，日本必勝</p>
<p>之決意，即泰國國民之決</p>
<p>意，泰國之繁榮，亦唯有</p>
<p>完成大東亞戰爭，方能確</p>
<p>保之。</p>

<h3>財部改定　鹽斤售價</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社</p>
<p>電　鹽稅改定稅率，業經</p>
<p>財政部呈舉行政院，轉奉</p>
<p>最高國防會議核準。又海</p>
<p>州區改定帶征復興費數目</p>
<p>，及浙東·松江·淮南·</p>
<p>等區一律依照海州區辦理</p>
<p>，均經該部通令，於本月</p>
<p>十六日施行。頃該部海州</p>
<p>·浙東·松江·等區局及</p>
<p>塲運銷各商，呈以近來物</p>
<p>價騰貴，產製運銷各成本</p>
<p>因而激增，原定塲價及運</p>
<p>銷價費，不敷甚鉅，請求</p>
<p>改定售價。經該部詳加考</p>

<h3>美宣吿凍結　阿根廷資金</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央</p>
<p>社電　據華盛頓電，美政</p>
<p>府十六日發表，凍結美國</p>
<p>內之阿根廷資金，但稱此</p>
<p>乃暫時之措置。</p>
<h3>日軍政當局　重申在華作戰眞義</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　大東亞戰爭發動</p>
<p>以來，日軍在中國大陸作戰之眞義，在打破英</p>
<p>美制期東亞之妄想。此際日本政府又表明日</p>
<p>本之眞意，謂日軍之作戰目的，在消減英美侵</p>
<p>略東亞企圖，中國民衆，固為日軍之友，而重</p>
<p>慶軍隊，亦非日軍之敵云。日本中國派遺軍當</p>
<p>局，於十七日發表聲明，說明此次大陸作戰之</p>
<p>眞義，及英美對中國民衆之暴戾行為，並表明</p>
<p>戰後復興與作戰地之行政方針，力　對戰後復</p>
<p>興，及中國民衆福利，決作最善努力。</p>
<p>大陸作戰益趨激化</p>
<p>今河南</p>
<p>方面，</p>
<p>陽及</p>
<p>湖南各</p>
<p>要　，</p>
<p>均入日軍掌握，此次作戰</p>
<p>實日美兩國在中國大陸之</p>
<p>決戰。蓋美國階中操縱渝</p>
<p>軍，同時，美駐淪空軍及</p>
<p>美機械化部隊，亦頗活躍</p>
<p>。美駐渝空軍原擴呼應麥</p>
<p>克沃塞攻勢，由大陸東南</p>
<p>前進基地，空襲日本木土</p>
<p>。現此種企圖，因衡陽之</p>
<p>陷落，及東關前進基地之</p>
<p>無能爲力，　成泡影。今</p>
<p>惟有呼應尼米資攻勢，以</p>
<p>B29型機由西北基地成都</p>
<p>空襲日本，同時，不分</p>
<p>夜，肓炸大陸戰區，及和</p>
<p>平地區，美方在大陸作戰</p>
<p>中之軍事指導權，相當鉅</p>
<p>大。</p>
<p>據前綫消息，重慶設</p>
<p>有對日作戰美渝統一指揮</p>
<p>部，由蔣介石任總司令，</p>
<p>史蒂威兩任參謀長。渝軍</p>
<p>作戰由史蒂威爾負實指揮</p>
<p>，美第十四航空隊及渝美</p>
<p>飛行聯隊，均歸捷備德直</p>
<p>接指揮。又美第二十航空</p>
<p>隊P29型機，則由美陸軍</p>
<p>航空司令阿諾特直接統率</p>
<p>，渝軍對其指導權，則無</p>
<p>力過問，至美空軍協助渝</p>
<p>軍行為，亦由美方自由決</p>
<p>定，河南作戰期間，出擊</p>
<p>機數僅三百架，長沙防衛</p>
<p>戰中亦未見活躍。此次美</p>
<p>空軍目睹己方一大前進基</p>
<p>地衝陽已臨危境，始以累</p>
<p>計，不過十架之餘送機，</p>
<p>載運軍藻糧　，並接濟城</p>
<p>內渝軍，復以出動飛機累</p>
<p>計，亦不過五百架。地面</p>
<p>渝軍則於六十餘名美將校</p>
<p>醬戰下，使用毒瓦斯，以</p>
<p>圖頑强抵抗。</p>
<p>據最近情報，傅美機</p>
<p>械化部隊前曾由滇緬邊境</p>
<p>以飛機　送一部兵力，前</p>
<p>往衡陽，在實慶。衝揚。</p>
<p>零陸。公路一帶集中。企</p>
<p>圖奪回術陽，大陸日美作</p>
<p>戰，乃日益激化。</p>
<p>兩種不同作戰方式</p>
<p>日軍本</p>
<p>道義精</p>
<p>神，發</p>
<p>動此次</p>
<p>戰爭，</p>
<p>與英為滿足制　東亞野心</p>
<p>之侵略戰，逈然不同，兩</p>
<p>種不同戰爭方式實予民衆</p>
<p>以深刻的敎訓。日本軍最</p>
<p>高指揮官會於「告將士</p>
<p>畫」中發表「不燒，不殺</p>
<p>，不死」之鐵律，極力避</p>
<p>免使中國民衆困苦，田野</p>
<p>荒廢，文物破壞，務對復</p>
<p>興建設，作最大努力，河</p>
<p>南戰役後，洛陽等都市及</p>
<p>農村，己向復興之途邁進</p>
<p>，獲致良好效果，由此可</p>
<p>見日軍「嚴正之軍規」以</p>
<p>及「實踐道義」之根木中</p>
<p>義而作戰，即使遭遇困難</p>
<p>亦得迎刃而解。日軍作戰</p>
<p>之特微，亦即為前綫日軍</p>
<p>將士之堅强信念作戰地區</p>
<p>有須確立治安，並迅速恢</p>
<p>復軍政機構，始能弭平戰</p>
<p>禍，回復太平。並須　循</p>
<p>鄉材習慣，尊重民衆意見</p>
<p>，並由民衆中之有力者，</p>
<p>出而倡導鄉材自治，此在</p>
<p>湖南，即以「湖南人之湖</p>
<p>南」為口號，使復興其鄉</p>
<p>土。今後於作戰地區應由</p>
<p>民衆全體之總意及力量，</p>
<p>復興彼等自身之鄉土，而</p>
<p>達得民族解放確立自主獨</p>
<p>立，掃除一切桎桔，而完</p>
<p>成民衆之宿望，為建設鄉</p>
<p>土及社會，須依照從來和</p>
<p>平地區諸旣定計劃，檢討</p>
<p>物價政策，力求物資之目</p>
<p>由流通，都市與農材之經</p>

<p>美軍士兵非人行為</p>
<p>之非人</p>
<p>道行為</p>
<p>，在此</p>
<p>次作戰</p>
<p>中，已</p>
<p>暴露無遺，如於入日飛臨</p>
<p>衡陽上空之美機，會對渝</p>
<p>方降軍，濫施轟炸，此種</p>
<p>處事實，為富時偵察日</p>
<p>機所目覩，美機並對陸績</p>
<p>歸來之民衆，亦盲目濫炸</p>
<p>，如湖南之省會長沙，於</p>
<p>六月十八日被日軍攻克後</p>
<p>，住民相繼歸來，迄七月</p>
<p>中止，僅較戰前人口二十</p>
<p>三萬少三萬五千名，現均</p>
<p>各安生業，復典氣象與日</p>
<p>俱增。美機目睹民衆集團</p>
<p>歸來，猶每日前來轟炸，</p>
<p>已往繁華地區名勝古跡，</p>
<p>均遭炸毀，受害民衆達千</p>
<p>數百名。美軍猶不滿足，</p>
<p>復於十五日在城內投下炸</p>
<p>彈三千枚，實施徹底的焦</p>
<p>土戰術。溯自日軍大陸作</p>
<p>戰以來，英美之暴戾殘忍</p>
<p>已完全暴露，現日軍已發</p>
<p>揮眞正之道義精神，收獲</p>
<p>赫赫戰果，吾人對日本中</p>
<p>國派遺軍之此次聲明，已</p>
<p>完全明瞭，自當以全力協</p>
<p>助日軍，以擊滅敵人英美</p>

<h3>Increasing Agricultural Production and Unifying Institutions</h3>
<p>Increasing production during wartime is already an absolute principle for participating nations, requiring no further explanation. We, China, are also a participating nation, and in theory, increasing production has been established as a national policy. The wartime economic policy outline promulgated by the National Government on February 13th of last year included "increasing production" as its first item. In his New Year's Day address this year, Chairman Wang also listed "increasing production" as one of the three major work priorities and stipulated that this year would be a year of general mobilization for increased production. At the same time, the slogan of increasing production has been widely raised in all aspects, almost becoming a household term.</p>
<p>However, what is the actual situation? Let's examine the current industrial and production situation in Shanghai. Repeated power restrictions, difficulty in obtaining raw materials, and inconvenience in transporting finished products make it difficult to maintain the original output, let alone increase it. Shanghai is the center of the country's industry, and if it is like this, the situation in other places can be imagined. Moreover, China's industry is limited by mechanical technology. Heavy industry has no foundation, and even light industry has only established a foundation and a rough scale in the few years before the war. However, after the turmoil of the war, even this roughly scaled light industrial foundation has been damaged. Therefore, even if we produce as much as possible, we still cannot catch up with the pre-war level.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of agriculture, due to the turmoil in rural areas after the war, some areas were also invaded by the New Fourth Army, and normal conditions have not been restored. On the one hand, the unified procurement method is not reasonable, which makes farmers fearful and reduces their interest in farming. Although we have no statistics to prove it, from the general situation, the yield of crops in recent years has also decreased rather than increased.</p>
<p>Theoretically, great importance is attached to increasing production, but in fact, the actual effect of increasing production is greatly questioned. Then, who should bear this responsibility? Of course, the government is in a leading position. In the positive aspect, it cannot strengthen the leading and implementing mechanisms, nor can it effectively implement the production increase plan. In the negative aspect, it cannot eliminate the obstacles to production increase, nor can it create an environment and conditions for production increase. The people only occupy the position of producers. With appropriate and strong leadership, such as a unified institution, with an environment of rather die than yield, such as the establishment of public security, and with supply conditions, such as the supply of raw materials and technical guidance, then the actual effect of increasing production is not difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>During this decisive period, the purpose of increasing production is, of course, to contribute to the war effort and strive for final victory. However, we always believe that the work of increasing production is undertaken by the people. We must first stabilize the people's minimum living standards before we can go all out. The most needed things to stabilize people's livelihoods are food and clothing. Therefore, the work of increasing production should start with food and cotton, followed by the flour industry and the textile industry. We will not discuss the industrial aspect for the time being. Only in terms of agriculture, we believe that the unification of the leading institutions is a very important prerequisite.</p>
<p>At present, the government agencies related to agricultural production include the Agricultural Production Increase Committee, the Cooperative Affairs Committee, and the Rural Construction Committee, which are directly under the Executive Yuan. Secondly, there are the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Ministry of Industry, the Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Plant of the Ministry of Construction, and the Rural Welfare Bureau of the Ministry of Social Welfare. In addition, there are various units related to rural work in the New Movement Association, and the part of the Youth Work-Study Corps related to rural work. Although the tasks of the above institutions are different, the goals are the same.</p>
<p>We advocate that, in order to achieve the practical effect of increasing agricultural production, the government's leadership of agricultural institutions must be unified. All parts related to agriculture should be merged and integrated into one unit. The task of this unit is to lead and implement the national agricultural production increase, and a special department should be set up directly under the Executive Yuan, tentatively named the "Agricultural Production Increase Department." Whether it is feasible, we hope that the government and the public will discuss it together.</p>
<h3>The Purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to Destroy Anglo-American Aggression - Statement Issued by the Japanese China Expeditionary Army</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Expeditionary Army issued a statement at 3 p.m. on the 17th, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Practicing the Spirit of Morality</p>
<p>"After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, all Anglo-American bases in East Asia were completely lost, and they fled outside the East Asian circle. However, they still conspire insidiously, using the beautiful name of resistance to Japan, skillfully appease and win over the Chongqing regime, and extend their claws to the East Asian continent, indulging in their ambition to control East Asia. Our Expeditionary Army, in order to complete the purpose of the Greater East Asia War, based on the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, resolutely rose up, destroyed all aggressive forces on the mainland, in order to liberate the Chinese nation and the nation from the shackles they suffered, and launched a great offensive. This operation has already issued orders, the whole army has strict military discipline, and practices morality. And it is announced to the Chinese people that they should live in peace and enjoy their work. However, the people's suffering caused by the war, the desolation of the fields, and the destruction of cultural relics are deeply worried by our army. Therefore, we often limit the disaster of war to a minimum, and at the same time, we try our best to engage in reconstruction. The Chinese people all understand the spirit of our army and automatically cooperate and achieve satisfactory results. This has been proven by facts in various places, and there is no need to repeat it. However, the violent Anglo-Americans burn down city streets and residential houses, destroy transportation facilities, in order to hinder construction, and trample on the people, even massacring innocent people, so that post-war reconstruction cannot be completed as scheduled. It is found that Anglo-Americans use the beautiful name of cooperation to level Chinese territory and make it their own battlefield. They do not care about turning it into scorched earth for the territory of other countries. The happiness and misfortune of the Chinese people are not what they care about. Their inhuman animal nature is truly resented by both humans and gods.</p>
<p>Destroying the Common Enemy</p>
<p>China and Japan are united by Eastern morality, and Anglo-Americans are our common enemy. The Imperial Government stated in its statement: "The purpose of our country's military operations in China is entirely to destroy the enemy's Anglo-American aggressive ambitions. The Chinese people are our friends, and even the Chongqing army, if they can eliminate cooperation with Anglo-Americans, are not our enemies." The Japanese government is willing to make the people of East Asia understand the true meaning of mutual understanding and cooperation. Our army is now following and practicing this statement in order to destroy the rebels in East Asia, assist China's autonomy and independence, and the peaceful life and work of the 400 million people. As for the preservation and stability of the war zone and the rear, the Japanese army is temporarily responsible for this. This is because we aim to quickly restore order, avoid the suffering of the people, respect public opinion and customs, and promote the renewal of local society. There is no other intention. We hope that all Chinese sages, enlightened scholars, and patriotic youths will understand the current serious situation of the fate of China and the ups and downs of the world, and take no wrong steps for the long-term plan of the country, promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, encourage cooperation, and strive to complete China's autonomous independence and unified nation-building."</p>
<h3>Thailand Decides to Fully Cooperate to Complete the Greater East Asia War - First Speech by New Prime Minister Abhaiwongse</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Thai Prime Minister Abhaiwongse met with a group of Japanese reporters for the first time at his official residence at 3 p.m. on the 16th and made the following statement: The policy of the new Thai cabinet has been fully expressed in the parliament. The cooperation between Thailand and Japan is as described in the six major political outlines that I have announced. It is natural to abide by the treaties concluded by both parties. The specific strategy is that Thailand will do its best to cooperate with Japan and carry out the war. The first thing to do is economic cooperation. In addition, the lives of the Thai people are gradually becoming difficult due to the progress of the war, which is a natural phenomenon. The Thai people have to thoroughly realize this. Therefore, the government is currently doing its best to study and stabilize the people's livelihood. Regarding price countermeasures, we are preparing to form a strong committee with representatives from the existing Thai Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Indian Business Federation, and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce. This will be the representative organization of commerce, and it will implement reasonable and autonomous price management. The government will provide guidance and supervision from the side. Regarding the revitalization of industry, we also plan to work hard to revitalize private industry, and the government will provide technical assistance for this. Regarding air defense countermeasures, in order to ensure everything is perfect, the Air Defense Committee of the Ministry of Interior is currently studying appropriate methods. In order to win the victory in the World War and the East Asia War, Thailand and Japan are allies. Japan's determination to win is the determination of the Thai people. Thailand's prosperity can only be ensured by completing the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Battles on Bougainville Island Turn Fierce - Japanese Garrison Repeatedly Annihilates Stubborn Enemies</h3>
<p>South Pacific Base, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese garrison on Bougainville Island is still inviting enemy landing troops to attack and firmly defending Tan Island. However, since the end of July, the enemy's offensive in all aspects has gradually become fierce. The following is a detailed record: In the Torokina area, since July 27th, about a large battalion of enemy troops has attacked the Japanese garrison's defensive position. On the evening of August 2nd, the Japanese garrison launched a fierce attack on the enemy's left wing, and at the same time, launched a night attack on the enemy's rear with the main force, repelling them. In this battle, the enemy abandoned 15 corpses, and the Japanese army was killed one person. In the Hume Bay area, since the end of July, the enemy has relentlessly attacked the Japanese army's position. The Japanese garrison received assistance from the Numma area. On the dawn of August 7th, one team restrained about 300 enemy soldiers in the east. Another main force surrounded them from the lower reaches of the Lalwe River, and launched a fierce attack, causing them to collapse. The battle results of the Japanese army were 68 enemy corpses abandoned, three heavy machine guns captured by the Japanese army, and countless bullets. The Japanese army only killed three people. In the Ehrlesita area, since August 7th, enemy planes have frequently attacked. On the 7th and the 8th, about one hundred enemy planes came to attack, and machine-gunned the Japanese army's position. The Japanese army immediately invited them to attack, shooting down two of them. The losses of the Japanese army were very small.</p>
<p>Japanese Daredevil Team Wins Citation</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After the Japanese army retreated from Guadalcanal at the southern end of the Solomon Islands in February of last year, a small number of Japanese soldiers remained on the island and engaged in an offensive battle with the American army for a year. These facts were recently clarified by the relevant parties, which aroused great emotion among the Japanese people. The Japanese army on the island, in December of the 17th year of Showa (1942), the entire team of the Terasawa Daredevil Scouts risked sneaking into the heavily guarded enemy airfield, bombing airplanes and airfield facilities, etc., which made the enemy army terrified. The commander of the Japanese army in the area previously awarded citations to Lieutenant Terasawa and five warriors of the Daredevil Scouts. This matter was recently reported to His Majesty the Emperor. On the 17th of this month, the Ministry of the Army announced the fact that the unit had won a citation.</p>
<h3>Transportation Capacity Between Japan and the Mainland Enhanced - Considerable Results Achieved in the Exchange of Materials</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The mainland railways in Korea, Manchuria, and North China are important transportation arteries for Japan to transport supplies to mainland China, and their importance is increasing day by day. The railway authorities in various places are aware of this. Although they have closely cooperated in the past, they have actively promoted measures to enhance transportation capacity in order to promote and strengthen transportation capacity in various places. Therefore, transportation in Korea, Manchuria, and North China has been smoothly promoted recently. At the same time, the performance of transporting and exchanging materials has also been able to achieve considerable results in accordance with the original plan. Among them, railway transportation in Korea has achieved results beyond expectations. As for the locomotives and military vehicles in various parts of the mainland, their distribution status is also very appropriate, which is the most noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Chu Arrives in Beiping</h3>

<h3>American Generals and Colonels Flee in Face of Danger in Hengyang</h3>
<p>Hunan Front Line, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Hengyang, which fell on the day of the 8th, was equipped with more than 70 American generals, colonels, and technicians to supervise the Chongqing army's operations. However, before the fall of Hengyang, they abandoned the Chongqing army and fled. According to reports, at the beginning of the battle in Hengyang, there were more than 70 American generals, colonels, and technicians in the city of Hengyang. About 100 technical personnel were on the right bank of the Xiangjiang River at the airfield. In addition, there were 150 missionaries. They all returned to the rear before and after the fall of Changsha on June 18th. The workers at the airfield also retreated together a few days before the airfield fell. The generals and colonels in the city of Hengyang vowed to defend the city to the death at the beginning of the war. However, when the 79th Army counterattacked the North Gate at the beginning of this month, they fled in the chaos. The above is what the prisoners said.</p>
<h3>Li Shengwu Appointed Chairman of the Judicial Official Examination Committee</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Revises Salt Price</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The revised salt tax rate has been submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Finance and transferred to the Supreme National Defense Conference for approval. In addition, the revised number of reconstruction fees for the Haizhou District and the practice of the Zhedong, Songjiang, and Huainan districts uniformly following the Haizhou District have all been ordered by the Ministry and implemented on the 16th of this month. Recently, the bureaus and field transportation and sales merchants in the Haizhou, Zhedong, and Songjiang districts of the Ministry have presented that the price of goods has risen recently, and the cost of production, manufacturing, transportation, and sales has increased sharply. The original field price and transportation and sales costs are not enough, and they requested to revise the selling price. After the Ministry carefully examined the grain balance and weighed the pros and cons, and took into account the cost of each merchant and the burden on the people, an average price was set for each jin using the method of checking calculations. For example, the cost of the China Company to transport to Shanghai and the Yangtze River area is set at one price. The sales expenses of the Yuhua Company have also been verified and approved. Together with the newly revised tax rate and reconstruction fees, the overall calculation is carried out, and the listed price is reordered and issued, and it is scheduled to be implemented from August 16th. It will be sold by the Yuhua Company according to the numbers listed in the table, and no extra money will be charged. As for the retail jin by small vendors (ie, soy sauce shops and Jian shops), the handling fee will still be charged according to the case, but it should not exceed 20% of the official price. A retail price will also be set, and the Jianwu Management Offices in Nanjing and other places will be instructed to follow it.</p>
<h3>US Announces Freezing of Argentine Funds</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a Washington telegram, the US government announced on the 16th that it would freeze Argentine funds in the United States, but said that this was a temporary measure.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military and Political Authorities Reiterate the True Meaning of Operations in China</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the true meaning of the Japanese army's operations in mainland China has been to break the Anglo-American delusion of controlling East Asia. At this time, the Japanese government has also stated the true intention of Japan, saying that the purpose of the Japanese army's operations is to reduce the Anglo-American attempts to invade East Asia. The Chinese people are, of course, friends of the Japanese army, and the Chongqing army is not an enemy of the Japanese army. The Japanese China Expeditionary Army authorities issued a statement on the 17th, explaining the true meaning of this mainland operation and the violent behavior of Anglo-Americans towards the Chinese people, and stating the administrative guidelines for post-war reconstruction and the war zone, and striving to do their best for post-war reconstruction and the welfare of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Mainland Operations Are Intensifying</p>
<p>Now, the major points in Henan and Hunan are all in the hands of the Japanese army. This operation is actually a decisive battle between Japan and the United States on the Chinese mainland. It is said that the United States is manipulating the Chongqing army in the ranks. At the same time, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the US mechanized troops are also quite active. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing originally expanded the response to the MacArthur offensive. The bases in the southeast of the mainland launched air strikes on the Japanese mainland. Now, this attempt has become a bubble due to the fall of Hengyang and the inability of the Dongguan forward base. Now, the only thing is to respond to the Nimitz offensive, using B29 aircraft to bomb Japan from the Chengdu base in the northwest. At the same time, regardless of day and night, they blindly bomb the mainland war zone and peaceful areas. The US military's guidance on the mainland operations is quite large.</p>
<p>According to front-line news, Chongqing has a unified US-Chongqing command headquarters for operations against Japan, with Chiang Kai-shek as the commander-in-chief and Stilwell as the chief of staff. Stilwell is actually in command of the Chongqing army's operations. The US 14th Air Force and the Chongqing-US Flying Wing are directly under the command of Chet Bredell. The US 20th Air Force's P29 aircraft are directly under the command of US Army Air Force Commander Arnold. The Chongqing army has no power to intervene in its guidance. The US Air Force's assistance to the Chongqing army's actions is also freely decided by the US. During the Henan operation, the number of sorties was only 300. It was not active in the Changsha defense battle. This time, the US Air Force saw that a major forward base of its own, Chongyang, was in danger. Only a total of more than 10 aircraft were sent to transport military food and supplies and resupply the Chongqing army in the city. The cumulative number of sorties was only 500. The ground Chongqing army used poison gas under the war of more than 60 American generals and colonels in an attempt to stubbornly resist.</p>
<p>According to recent intelligence, the US mechanized troops previously transported a force by plane from the Yunnan-Burma border to Hengyang, where they concentrated in the Shiqiao and Linglu areas. Attempting to recapture Nanyang, the US-Japan war on the mainland is intensifying.</p>
<p>Two Different Modes of Operation</p>
<p>The Japanese army launched this war in the spirit of morality. It is completely different from the Anglo-American war of aggression to satisfy the ambition of controlling East Asia. These two different modes of warfare have given the people a profound lesson. The highest commander of the Japanese army has issued the iron law of "no burning, no killing, no death" in the "Declaration to the Soldiers," trying to avoid causing the Chinese people to suffer, the fields to be barren, and cultural relics to be destroyed. He must make the greatest effort for reconstruction. After the Henan campaign, cities and villages such as Luoyang have embarked on the road to revival and achieved good results. This shows that the Japanese army's "strict military regulations" and "practice of morality" operate from the root of righteousness, and even if it encounters difficulties, it can be solved easily. The characteristics of the Japanese army's operations are also the firm belief of the Japanese soldiers on the front line. The area of operation must establish public security and quickly restore military and political institutions in order to quell the war and restore peace. We must also follow local customs, respect public opinion, and encourage the influential people among the people to advocate local autonomy. In Hunan, the slogan is "Hunanese for Hunan," so that they can revive their homeland. In the future, in the war zone, the overall will and strength of the people should be used to revive their own homeland and achieve national liberation, establish autonomous independence, eliminate all fetters, and complete the people's long-cherished wish. In order to build the homeland and society, the established plans in peaceful areas should be followed, the price policy should be reviewed, and efforts should be made to ensure the free circulation of materials, the close economic connection between urban and rural areas, the adjustment of the circulation of materials in the war zone, and the promotion of the increase of materials.</p>
<p>The Inhuman Acts of US Soldiers</p>
<p>In this operation, the inhumane behavior of the Americans has been fully exposed. For example, the US planes that flew over Hengyang on the day of the 8th indiscriminately bombed the Chongqing army. This kind of fact was witnessed by the reconnaissance aircraft of the Japanese army. The US planes also blindly bombed the civilians who were returning to the land. For example, Changsha, the provincial capital of Hunan, was captured by the Japanese army on June 18. The residents returned one after another. As of the middle of July, it was only 35,000 less than the pre-war population of 230,000. Now they are all living in peace, and their recovery is increasing day by day. The US planes saw the crowds of people returning, and they still came to bomb every day. The famous historical sites in the past prosperous areas were all bombed, and thousands of people were victimized. The US army was not satisfied, and dropped 3,000 bombs in the city on the 15th, implementing a thorough scorched earth tactic. Since the Japanese army's operations on the mainland, the violence and cruelty of the Anglo-Americans have been fully exposed. Now the Japanese army has demonstrated the true spirit of morality and achieved great results. We have fully understood the statement of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army this time and will certainly assist the Japanese army with all our strength to destroy the enemy Anglo-Americans.</p>
<h3>German Troops in Southern France Fighting Valiantly, Harbor Facilities All Destroyed</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Führer's Headquarters on the 16th announced: German troops on the northern coast of Southern France, although repelling the attempt by counter-Axis forces to land between Toulon and Cannes, the counter-Axis forces have gained footholds in several coastal locations. Counter-Axis paratroopers have landed behind German defense zones, and German reserve units are currently launching fierce attacks against them.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to frontline German sources, the counter-Axis forces on the Southern France front continued to reinforce their troops by sea and air on the evening of the 15th. The current fighting extends westward from the vicinity of the Port of Hyères to the area of Mont Coudon, east of the Bay of Toulon.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>A German news agency reports: Under the cover of naval artillery fire, British and American forces are continuously reinforcing troops within the enemy bridgehead in southern France day and night, but so far have only made slight progress in the Saint-Raphaël area, and have invaded the Argens River basin. The enemy made new landing attempts on both sides of the Toulon fortress, but were repelled. The enemy gained a foothold in the Cannes area, and German troops are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy at other landing sites.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The counter-Axis forces have begun new landing operations on the southern coast of France. The German troops under the command of General Manfred Rommel, responsible for the defense of that area, should be able to exert their strength. The German authorities are silent, which is different from the Normandy front. The decisive battle will be launched after the counter-Axis forces are in a favorable position in the rear, and then the counter-Axis forces will be wiped out in one fell swoop. Therefore, based on the above policy, the German army has destroyed the harbor facilities of Nice, Cannes, and Saint-Tropez. From the landing site to the land area of ​​the hills of the Provence region, the German army is currently fighting bravely everywhere, engaging in fierce battles with the counter-Axis forces. The strongholds of the counter-Axis forces are located in a wide coastal area from the Bay of Nice to the Bay of Hyères, but the counter-Axis forces themselves have not yet established contact, and therefore have not formed a single battle line. The counter-Axis supply bases are the islands east of Hyères, Saint-Raphaël, and Cap d'Antibes. German bomber squadrons and mine-laying squadrons have strongly attacked the counter-Axis warships in that area, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<p>German Troops Withdraw from Dinard, Brittany</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Führer's Headquarters on the 16th announced: Dinard has already fallen. Dinard is located in the eastern part of the Brittany Peninsula. The German troops in that port, like the German troops in Saint-Malo, once used all their strength to resist the attacks of the counter-Axis forces, and defended the port for a long time.</p>
<p>Counter-Axis Forces Attack and Enter Chartres</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>A German dispatch reports that military sources announced this morning: Yesterday, enemy forces attacked eastward and entered Chartres (located west of Paris), 43 miles from Paris.</p>

<h3>Water and Electricity Company to Halve Water Supply Starting Tomorrow, Every Morning from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the wartime system and conserve tap water consumption, the China Water and Electricity Company will reduce the water supply by about one-half from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM every day, starting tomorrow (the 19th). During this period, the water pressure above the second floor will be lower than usual, and it is even possible that there will be no water flowing out of the end of the water pipes. Fearing that users may misunderstand, a prior notice is hereby given. As for the above-mentioned time period, it is hoped that users will pay attention and provide assistance to achieve the following two points: When not using water, please be sure to close the faucet tightly to prevent the water pipe from sucking in air and causing obstacles. It is best not to extend the rubber hose directly into the wooden basin, ceramic basin, or lead bucket when washing clothes, so as to prevent the water pipe from sucking in sewage when the wooden pressure is applied.</p>

<h3>Transferring Manuscript Fees to Donate to Scholarships, Poor Writers Sympathize with Poor Students</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received about 50,000 yuan in scholarship donations from about 30 donors, ranging from 10 yuan to 10,000 yuan per person. It can be said that it is a collection of small efforts. We are extremely hopeful for large numbers, but we also welcome small numbers. A donation of 2,000 yuan can save an elementary school student from dropping out of school. This elementary school student, because of my kind thought, is spared from dropping out of school. In the future, he may learn to use his knowledge to serve the country and establish achievements. Then today's donor has invisibly accumulated blessings, which is so glorious.</p>
<p>Among yesterday's donors, it is worth noting that four of them "transferred manuscript fees". Among them, Mr. Zhang Sumin wrote in a letter: "The manuscript fee of 2,1200 yuan obtained from my book "Fifty Years" is transferred to your newspaper's scholarship fund." Writing and submitting articles is the work of poor writers, most of whom are only qualified to be helped. Now, in order to sympathize with poor students who have dropped out of school, they give up their qualifications to be helped and help others, which is really admirable. We also hope that those with more financial resources will also show their sympathy for those who have dropped out of school and donate more so that we can achieve the goal of fully subsidizing the applying students.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Receipt of Scholarship Funds: Tongren of the Yifeng Yarn Factory, a person from Keqiao, Zhang Wanyuan, the owner of the Haitang Bookstore, Bao Jingshi (football lottery ticket fund), 5,000 yuan each, a reader 4,000 yuan, Zhang Sumin 3,200 yuan, Gu Xu's family (transferred compensation for medical expenses) 3,000 yuan, Zhang Meisheng, a person with a name, 1,000 yuan each, Qian Jun, Deji, Junji, Bi Keqing, 500 yuan each, Yu Jun (manuscript fee) 375 yuan, Zhu Yuchang, Jiang Lianhua, Wei Hongzhang, Zhang Yijiu, Guo Rongfu, Tong Jingzhi, Zhang Shouzhi, Sun Rongchun, Zheng Yulin, Zhu Ruigeng, Ren Xinle, 300 yuan each, Zhang Jiukun (manuscript fee) 225 yuan, Wang Yuanan, Hong Jianyun, Zhu Zuyao, Shi Baiquan, 200 yuan each, Cheng Hanming, Shi Zui (manuscript fee) 120 yuan each, Zhang Minglun, Bin Jun, 100 yuan each, Ting Jun (postage) 20 yuan, picked up ten yuan, totaling 49,370 yuan in reserve coupons, with a balance of 13,841,076 yuan.</p>
