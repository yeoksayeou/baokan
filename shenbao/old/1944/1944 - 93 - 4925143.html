<p>社評</p>
<h3>「吝嗇」與「熱心」</h3>
<p>本市警察消費合作社，自經警察當積極籌備進行以來，瞬將兩句，對於一萬萬元之資金，亦經分向社會各界曁各業同業公會請求墊借，希望於四月十日截止，彙齊資金，即行成立。聞日來若干同業公會正召機會解款，而若干公會則觀望推卻。商店及設富人士依然。</p>
<p>我們就客觀立塲，對於墊借資金一事，曾數座獻藝。總而言之，警察擔負維護治安責任，服務效率之高低，直接影響於治安之良窳。而治安之良毓，直接影響於全市之安詣。組織警察消費合作社，直接是改善警察生活，簡介就是提高警察服務效率，增加維護治安的力量，保持全市的安詣。這並不是空泛的理論，二是適切的事實，應爲稍明事理的市民國共同認識的。雖然，因為過去英美人管理的巡捕房的積習甚深，市民對於警察的印象不能滿意，但自租界收回後，很多警政新進人才曁盟邦尃家參加工作，確有漸次整頓之精神，不過在事實上不是短時期內立可改觀。所以我們應以不咎旣望期待將來的態度，共同協助解決警察生活上之困難，然後訓練成爲現代警察，使之克盡維護治安的重大使命起，盡力先完成這樁工作，待工作完成以後，再加檢討過去，而予以改善。這樣，完成工作的目的可達，同時，過去的不良印象也可消滅，如果因為已往過程中有了不良現象，九否認全部工作的目標，而不去熱烈完成·則其結果，工作完成固然無望，就是已往遇程中的不良印象也永遠存在，而不會消滅。這種結果，當然不是希望完成全部工作目的的人士，所應採取的狹隘態度。</p>
<p>更澈底的說，改善警察生活，幷不是目的，而目的是在藉警察生活改善以後，俾能提高服務效率，而使之負起維護治安的責任保，護市民的安謐。所以，改善警察生活是手段，而確保治安才是目的。因為過去巡捕房有了使人不滿意的印象，就不願改善警察生活，那未，警察生活不能改善，本身事件尙小，而整個治安難以確保，則影響大，當然我們不是說警察生活應加改善，而警察的無服務道德就可以不同。這點顯論列，我們不得不强調指陳，以為社會各界告。</p>
<p>最後，我們希望尙在觀望猶豫的同業公會諸君曁各界人士，墊借資金，有息有保，根本不是捐款。我們認為墊借資金樂願欲否，原因不在於眞正的無力和困難，而在於「吝嗇」與「熱心」之差別是己！</p>
<h3>上月份各地敵機被擊落八七架　日大本營昨發表陸軍戰果</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日大本營五日下午三時發表：帝國陸軍部隊於三月內攻或邀擊敵航空部隊，所獲之綜合戰果如次：　一敵方損害一中國方面敵機被擊落力架，（內二榮未證實）擊毀卅二架。緬甸方面擊落八十一架，（內廿三架木證實）擊毀五十一架。越南及泰國方面繫落三架。新幾內亞方面擊落百卅架，（內廿架未說實）擊毀十七架。玻根據兩島及俾斯麥群島等地，擊落九十八架。以上總計擊落擊毀敵機四百八十七架（內四十五架未證實）。　「我方損害」自炸未返基地者四十四架，陸上損害四十九架，總計九十三架。</p>
<p>東京五日中央社電　據日大本營今日發表稱，日路勁部隊予三月內在各戰綫所建之空戰戰果，計擊落敵機四百八十七架，（其中不確實者四十五架）日方喪失飛機亦達九十三架，以較二月內之戰果擊落機數增加八十架。且各戰綫來襲敵機之總數，由於緬甸戰綫及俾斯麥羣島戰況質特殊事情，二月內襲敵機總數爲二萬一千四十四架，三月內爲一萬八千三百廿九架，三目較二月雖己減少若干榮，但被日軍擊落繫毀者則激增，此均爲日軍第一綫部隊之奮戰所致，而日方飛機之孫志，二月內爲八十架，三月內增加至九十三架，戰況相當淒烈。</p>
<h3>印緬甸境日軍　攻佔達姆要塞　並追擊適軍予以重創</h3>
<p>仰光五日中央社電緬印前電：加鮑溪谷洛，英軍第二十四師約一旅之衆，於數日前據守莫列北方約四公里之莫列要塞，該陣彼日軍攻陷後，敵軍遂受日軍南北兩方之壓迫，乃於一日續向西北方山中潰走。日軍由東方加以猛攻追擊，終於突入達姆，敵軍殘部受重創，日軍即完全佔領該地。</p>
<p>緬印國境某基地五一日中央社電　英軍第二十師轄下約一旅之衆，由達姆方面沿達姆至巴列爾之公路，向西方山地敗退後，即與駐屯其後方陣地之英第二十三師約一旅團匯合，企圖作最後之掙扎，該方面日軍為此特由東方予以猛攻。同時另一路日軍則控制其退路，並予以重創。敵軍因日軍之攻擊失去退路後，即反覆作益意義之反攻，以謀殆死之掙扎，但經日軍攻擊後仍　熏創。</p>
<p>銀都機塲亮度被炸</p>
<p>緬甸某基地五日中央社電　日軍府衝轟炸機隊，三日晚及四日拂曉，曾兩度轟炸敵空挺身隊降落地區銀都共方約四十公里之敵新設機塲，炸毀地上敵機四榮及滑機七架，並使之起火。同時並轟炸機塲周圍之高射機關槍陣地予以重創，嗣後日機全部安返基地。</p>
<p>敵諜報隊破獲經過</p>
<p>東京五日中央社電　緬甸前綫某基地五日電：英軍少校希格勒姆等指揮下之敵諜報部隊二百撩人，上月十四日被日軍部隊及特別工作隊一網打盡後，於最近即由日軍予以槍決。按該諜報部隊於去年春季日軍攻陷仰光之前，曾以頓古東南方密林地帶為據點，從事調查日軍駐屯狀况。飛機塲之所在地，及其兵力之分佈情形，並計劃擾亂該方面之治安及蒐集情報等。同時該少校希格勒姆並曾於去年春起一年間內，從事訓練間諜員，會於去年夏季以來曾數次以無綫電機（此等無綫電機係由加爾各答以飛機運來者）與加爾各答司令部不斷聯絡，彼等身邊裝備之武器，僅有戰機關槍卅餘挺及盒槍獵槍等以為自衛之用。是故企圖擾亂緬甸日軍後方陣地之敵進挺隊以及此次希格勒姆之被逮捕，實為敵方之重大損失，自此以後日軍巳無後方之憂，而可傾力於對印進攻作戰。</p>
<p>英美方面表露不安</p>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　據新德里來電：東南亞反軸心軍司令部四日於戰報中曾宣稱：印度戰綫並未發生任何新變化，但據前機消息，伊姆法爾北方日軍將英印軍之一補給路完全遮斷後，更為使伊姆法爾陷於孤立，而自北東兩方所取至包圍攻勢似愈益强化。路透社特派員四日曾力言伊姆法爾北方戰局之緊張稱，日軍於伊姆法爾北方繼續西進形勢已不容樂觀。又合衆社記者亦曾承認　英軍敗北稱，英印軍於伊姻法爾東方之密材地帶，會與日軍激戰後，不得已而向馬尼日軍之猛攻，兵力消耗過甚，乃到後退。又紐約泰晤士報四日於社論中，曾對銀都戰力表明　關知見日軍之成功，均表重大關心，英軍不僅奪回緬甸之企圖告失敗，甚至印度國內瀰漫之政治不安亦不克鎭壓，印東北部之戰局已使斯蒂威爾孤立化增大，且因江特拉飽斯氏之屢屢發表聲明，益發引起動搖</p>
<p>僑歐印人極度感奮</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　印度國民軍於日軍急密協力下，開始進擊印度後，為居歐洲之印度國民聆悉之下，即深為感動，無不切望祖國獨立之日及早降臨，尤以柏林巴黎及白魯寒爾等地之「自由印度同盟」對祖國之獨立期望尤殷，其中在突尼西亞戰錢義大利戰綫參加英軍作戰而至被德軍俘虜之印人二百人，曾披瀝其所信，謂吾人願組織印度國民軍歐洲部隊，且加入歐洲戰綫作戰，並願冒一切危險前赴緬甸戰綫，為印度獨立而效命疆塲，駐歐部隊總帥兼不管部部長那姆比阿爾對此深為感謝，同時對於日軍此次進攻印度之舉措，更表感激。荒日本政府於日軍進註印度之同時，即表明其公正之一態度，謂將佔領地域移交印度臨時政府統治，此與英國政府印度戰後予以獨立之虛偽約言截然不同，且日本此種公正措置，實與歌洲各國國民以極深刻之印象。同時印度不管部部長那姆比阿爾除代表歐洲同志致電鮑斯祝賀外，更於三日在柏林中央本部發表談話，大意謂日印軍之進駐印展以後，待望已久之印度國民均即認淸鮑斯氏所採政策之正確，日軍對印軍事政治之援助，係出於公明正大，同時日軍此種公明正大之搭置，曾引起歐洲同志之極大感奮，雖反軸心陣　對於戰局曾作種種宣傳，但印度民衆不僅不為所惑，反不斷加入印度國民軍，而對軸心陣營戰力之信賴極為强固，此為彼等確信日印軍對英作戰必獲勝利之證據，但印度尚未完成獨立之前，自有相當困難，余於此更决心為完成祖國之建設而奮鬥。</p>

<p>事務停止</p>
<p>這次的次戰非常措置，乃要求官史牢先垂瀉，這是由政府次定該要綱的意閔看來，容易明際的。該要綱雞十項，載有俸止平時咸長期計游之事務喊事業。政蠟井滌哪職鵬騾炊施泌兩次的劃期措價。然辦此兩次的繞素化，對於教伶之擴泌行上，比較凡間沒有直接數要的官羅，尚有劉驗許多人負。政府雜及鈴此，花濾一儷年間，一齊停止官廳，公北團體箏的樣記事務汝事業，或實符大縮減，紹論是妥常的處置。</p>

<h3>喀爾巴阡戰事　居重要地位　史實昭示於守軍有利</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　據海通社訊：就東綫南路大戰之現狀觀察，喀爾已阡山一帶，將居相當重要地位。第一次世界大戰時，由東而來之攻擊至此以而被阻，一九一四年九月底蘇軍先鋒隊追襲奧匈軍隊入河谷後，進展甚緩，自一九一四年冬直至翌年春袛能奪佔要陰數處，蘇軍傷亡甚衆，一九一四年秋德奧處境頗危，奧匈軍隊在喀爾巴阡高地，戰國力甚薄弱，敵軍擊勢煊赫，當此時也德援革蒞臨助陣，善用山地之險要與敵力戰，轉危為安。史實昭示此次大戰德靈遠較昔日奧匈軍隊之戰鬬力焉强，德軍將領自可鎭靜應敵，須知蘇軍進攻之利器為坦克車，而山地戰爭則坦克車不易發揮威力矣。</p>
<p>聶斯特下游蘇增重壓力</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　海通社訊：東綫南路氣候轉變，風雪交作，故戰事業巳鬆弛，惟外尼斯特里亞仍有激戰。蘇軍白布格河下游向蒂里古爾推進，戰事現正在進行中。敵軍企岡在諾伐亞與奧油　附近渡越蒂里古爾河未逞，德軍反攻擊潰抵達該河西岸之敵軍部隊。蘇靈自員勒索夫加繼續向聶斯特河下游施用壓力，其目的在切斷在奧迪薩一帶作戰之德軍，惟敵軍無法阻止德軍有計劃之西退。預料德軍將利用奧油薩為根據地，在城南之防地進行堅強之抵抗。聶特河與普魯斯河之區域內，敵軍企圖切斷基希納夫與雅賽間之鐵路，但遭德軍堅強之抵抗後，完全失敗，敵軍向普魯斯河下游與多瑙河三角地帶之進展因此被阻羅馬尼亞師國在普魯斯河中游發動強有力之反攻，擊退敵軍之進攻，致敵革向雅賽之進展並無所獲。</p>
<p>三要城被圍</p>
<p>戰綫西段之蘇軍仍繼續進攻，其前鋒被阻於斯丹尼斯勒伏與柯柯米亞附近。蘇軍企圖自勃羅第向林姆堡方面之突破，亦被阻於德軍之防禦砲火，泰諾波爾·勃羅第與柯維爾等處國城之戰事，仍在發展中。此路爭奪普斯柯夫之戰事在繼續中。星期一之戰事中，德軍獲得全勝。</p>
<p>德洪羅合作保衛偶堡壘</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：蘇聯於英美之協助下，對羅馬尼亞發動之神經戰，係懷有不適當目的之一種。敵企圖因羅邊之軍事發展，利用之以作宣傳謂，由軍事觀點言之，羅國已被德國捨棄，故羅軍這是繼續抗戰，不獨作無意義之犧牲，並阻礙解決之可能性。但德指部解决洪牙利事件，即是表示德軍重視東南歐洲，德德國將竭力以對抗敵人歐洲堡壘之一角所作之軍事上及政治上之十涉。德蠶事方面認德羅軍共同流血而加强合作，蘇軍之前進即可被阻，失土即可恢復。</p>
<h3>蘇對羅馬尼亞　無領土野心　莫洛托夫聲明</h3>
<p>莫斯科五日中央社電　蘇外長莫洛托夫二日晚接見外國新聞記者團，發表東綫南部蘇軍之動向，按自開戰以來，該外長對外國記者團發表聲明，此為初次。其要旨如次，到達普魯特河之蘇軍，急追德羅軍，並於數地點渡過該河，而陸續向羅馬尼亞境內進攻中。並力練蘇聯政府無取得羅馬尼亞領土之目的，且無改變羅馬尼亞現在社會組織之意。該氏又謂，在發表此聲明前，蘇聯曾通告英美兩國政府繳得同意。</p>
<h3>羅馬尼亞京城　首次遭空襲　洪牙利首都再度被炸</h3>

<p>里斯本三日中央社電　英土軍事會議決裂後，英政府即禁止軍需品輸土，茲據泰晤士報及每日電訊報之華壓頓電，傳美政府亦依據租借法案，停止向土耳其輸出石油及其他物資云云。按英美兩國於合作之大前提下，而加強對土政府之外交上及經濟上之壓迫，顧勢所必趨也。又泰晤士報對此特為文評論稱，美國對上述事件雖尚未正式承部，然美政府為觀察土政府對反軸心陣營之態度，故始有此一次之措　，又兩國間之通商協定，如果當事國某一方於四月底止未通告廢棄，則以後當可繼續生效，美當局雖未肯定廢棄條約，然其希望棄棄協定，則係無可　言之事實。</p>

<h3>承認巴政權問題　反軸心暴露新弱點</h3>
<p>蘇聯的對義政策，與向來對巴爾幹，波蘭，北非等積極的熊度比較起來，較為消極。一如將義大利完全委之英美的勢力範圍，而表示漢不關心的態度。所以英美方面乘還蘇聯消極的態度，在蘇聯忙於東部戰綫攻繫的期間，迅即從事對義的軍事外交工作，企岡將義國收入自已囊中。</p>
<p>義艦隊　讓蘇聯的目的</p>
<p>美總統於三月三日發表以義艦隊三分之一讓與蘇聯的消息時，英與論以英國未曾同時發表，但事先亦未通知，故表示非常驚奇。此在英美任意處置養國的熊度而言，自是當然的歸趨。但羅斯福何故突然有此發表呢？這一點不免存有奇怪的印象‘</p>
<p>據十五日路透社莫斯科電，關於蘇聯與巴陀里奧間開始國交的談判，始於三月六日，而羅斯觸的發喪，正在莫斯科與巴陀里奧談判的預備交涉時期中。羅斯福的發表，究竟是為了使一般人就得莫斯科強求義艦隊三分之一的印象呢？還是表示英美　蘇準備讓步到此地步？一時難下斷語。但羅斯福顯　離間莫斯科與巴尼里奧的談判。</p>
<p>蘇聯在此次大戰中，採現實主義的外交方針，所以對義國也不想發動共產革命。並且也不輸助史福爾柴及古羅奇所領導的反王黨派，策動取代巴陀里奧的法西政權。這祇因義國內部情勢混亂，殊難預測其前途。從過去的展史看來，前次大戰後羲國共產遝動的結果，造成了墨索尼的法西政權，所以蘇聯不敢輕舉妄動。</p>
<p>斯達林的現實　外交</p>
<p>蘇聯至今日公然承認巴政權者，乃因南義情　已告穩定，由於蘇聯的承認，可強化巴陀里奧政權的綠故。這一點也就是斯達林的現實外交方針之表現。斯達林主張：「不策動別國的共產革命，而期待世界各國確立採取羅蘇政策的政權。</p>
<p>此種一般的蘇聯外交之適用問題，其特殊意義就在於此次承認巴政權。蘇聯此舉暫出於獨斷，事前並未間之於英美，因此，英美大起恐慌，而表示對蘇不　。莫斯科乃乘機對義開始外交攻勢。</p>
<p>在國際方面　據偷敦泰晤士報的拿波里特派員電，反軸心的義國管理委員會幾未開過會議，毫無活動。因而英美方面縱經軍隊的作戰本部而不斷與巴政權聯絡，但參加義國管理委員會的蘇聯與北非政權則以為委員會已逐漸喪失與義國的聯絡，倫敦的歐淵諮詢委員會，亦不重視該會，此乃英美欲獨佔對義工作的結果，蘇聯的承認巴政權，乃對英美的獨佔義國慾之猛烈的成攻。</p>
<p>亡命政權的追隨</p>
<p>巴政權獲得莫斯科的承認後，立即與芬蘭絕交，同時並與南斯拉夫的契特政權恢復國交關係。逃亡開羅的南斯拉夫與希臘的亡命政權，亦追隨巴政權之後，頗擬與莫斯科締結國交</p>
<p>蘇聯承認巴政權的目的，乃欲在各地擁立親蘇政權，為斯達林現寬外交之表現，及蘇聯對地中海的政治攻勢之強化。英美所取的方法。對他國不取明白的態度，立在反在動派與急進派的中間，不失雙方的同情，再稱之爲民主主義的方法；蘇聯則不同，以強力政治為基調，而出以斷然犯法。</p>
<p>中立國方面對蘇聯此次的措置，取長時間靜觀的被動態度。此在蘇聯觀測為當然的反動。但蘇聯不至因此掌握義國外交的主導權，任意左右義國。英美在里斯本，阿爾及耳，開羅，土耳其等地中海沿岸業已對蘇聯建設相的強國的橋頭堡。所以此次蘇聯的進出，亦似去年秋蘇聯的進出北非一樣，反使英美得以逐漸建築本身強固的傳統地盤，而有其特殊意義。</p>
<p>英國現遺查禮諾愛爾楚使於巴政權，擬對抗蘇聯。在全世界注目中的英美的狼狽與英美蘇三國同盟的新弱點，欲蓋彌彰，而暴靈在全世界人士的眼前。（翔：譯自三月十九日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>昨文廟隆重舉行　春季祀孔典禮　吳秘書長地標市長主祭</h3>
<p>昨（五）日為國定春季祀孔之期，巿府當局特在南市文廟大成殿上，舉行祀孔典禮，以追念至聖先師至大至圖之偉大精神，而發揚中華文化。由陳巿長（吳秘書長代）主祭，市敎育局長林炯庵，第二警察局長盧英，市財政局長袁厚之，市社會福利局長孫嗚岐等陪祭，市府各科長等襄祭，各團體機關代表與祭，各學校學生等數百餘人參加祀典，並有第二警察局樂隊奏樂，及該局特務大隊曁第七區自警團團本部，市立第一中學靑少年團等，派員到塲維持秩序。</p>
<p>儀式隆重</p>
<p>殿內佈置簡潔，先師孔子神位前及左右兩旁總聖神位前分接祭　，紅燭高燒，祀以水菓淸茶，十時正隆重儀式開始，於奏樂聲中，主祭者就位，陪祭者就位，襄祭者各就位，全體肅立唱國歌，向先師孔子行最敬禮三鞠躬後，由主陪祭者分別獻化。奏樂後，</p>
<p>恭讀祭文</p>
<p>曰：「維中華民國三十三年，歲次甲申，四月五日，上海特別市市長陳公博率同職員，謹以鮮花淸酒，致祭於大成至聖先師孔子曰，維先師法隆千古，道冠百王，與天地合其德，日月同其明，集聖學之大成，實生民所未有，道在忠恕協時中，以十六字之薪傳，開萬千年之文化，辟雍鐘鼓，洋溢和聲，淵雅笙歌，昭明盛典，今當春祭，虔備禮儀，爰率屬僚，共申景慕，春風煦物，如親作育之仁，化雨知時，上獻淵和之頌，謹依禮典，以復聖顏子，宗聖曾子，述聖子思子，亞聖孟子配尙響。」繼而由吳秘書長獻詞。</p>
<p>主祭獻詞</p>
<p>巿府吳秘書長代陳市長主祭，並獻詞謂：「各位先生：上海特別市政府春祭至聖孔子，本人此次代表市長參與斯典，不勝榮幸。孔聖偉大，想各位均已知道，茲就本人所發生感想，略述如次：　孔子學說千古不變，異乎社會一般哲學，蓋普通哲學本人亦曾硏究，僅適於其創始之時，不若孔聖學說之流傳久遠，歷數千載而不變。　據本人所知，世界上很多偉人之思想人格，均不一致，唯孔子之學說，於其人格合而為一。　孔子學識已滲入近代國家組織，我們知道中山先生之三民主義，是以孔子學說為其基礎，可見數千年前之孔子學說，實蘊有至理在焉。「最後唱孔子紀念歌後，攝影，在音樂聲中始告禮成。</p>

<h3>太平洋作戰　敵方無稽宣傳　松島報到部長披瀝見解</h3>
<p>美海軍部長諾克斯於上月三十一日聲稱：美有五十艘以上航空母艦參加太平洋作戰，又據二日、透社紐約電，美海軍機動部隊曾猛烈攻擊加羅林羣島云，彼等之誇大宜傳，早已失去內外之信仰，故全世界目耳，咸注視太平洋戰局之眞相如何。至四日果由日大本營發表在加羅林羣島南方擊沉擊毀敵艦六艘，至此，敵方之揑造宣傳，全告粉碎。日駐華艦隊報道部長，松島大佐特於昨（五）日披瀝其見解如次：</p>
<p>敵戰鬥力極為薄弱</p>
<p>美海軍部長諾克斯誇稱有航空母艦五十艘出動至太平洋方面，查目下夫海軍所使用之航空母艦，大半均為急速建成之補助母艦，戰鬥力極為薄弱。三月底以來，美機動部隊之反攻西加羅林方面，似出動相當部隊，此次戰鬥第一日為相當困難之夜戰，其後雙方屢次發生夜間空戰。我方實際所收獲之戰果，恐在大本營所發表者以上。因此敵方之報道，亦常時比較沉寂，尤以對於艦船之損害，致秘而不宣，敵在戰備尙未全部完成之前，所以屢次實施此項無理之反攻作戰者，其目的乃圖急速推進南太平洋之航空基地，而在菲島或中國方面獲得立足點，因此可以延長渝方垂斃之壽命，同時遮斷日本本土與南洋之交通綫，以搗亂共榮圈之團結。</p>
<p>决戰時機逐漸成熟</p>
<p>敵方何以焦急若此，蓋反軸心陣營之聯絡日益惡化，尤其美闡國內情勢極為緊張之故，然一面對於敵方利用馬紹爾，阿特密拉爾台之陸上基地，或驅使機動部隊，企圖突入我內側防禦綫之一事，在戰局之進展上，仍不容忽視。敵方為圖接近我本土防禦綫，因而用盡一切手叚，我方對此固不忽略警戒，且為對付敵方此項之反攻起見，舉凡前綫航空兵力及艦隊之決戰準備，均見日益加强，決戰時機，業已逐漸成熟，目下暫時所反覆進行之激烈前哨戰，實為正式海上決戰之先聲。在此期間之內，我方當亦決心耐受相當損失，蓋為完成最後目的起見，果敢戰法，實所必要。切望軸心國民，尤以大東亞各國國民應勿為敵方之妄動所惑，始終以冷靜頭腦，努力增强戰力，勿失擊滅英美之良好機會，是所至要。</p>

<h3>棉花緊急增產</h3>
<p>四月四日政院會議通過棉花緊急增產計劃，其草案係根據實業財政兩部曁農業增產策進委員會會同審查之意見而成，自必周詳縝密，切合實施，可無疑義，我們正不必對於棉花如何緊急增產一點，再加討論了。</p>
<p>我們所願一言者，即棉花緊急增產計劃通過以後，即須刻不容緩地予以實施，實施以後，即須積極地求其與紡織工業發生緊密連繫，以促進棉布生產之高度。</p>
<p>在棉布配給的前夕，我們對於棉布配給制，必須重其申說，就是棉布的統制配給售賣，必須於適應軍需重點下，不妨礙民需，故棉布配給，必須設法使之普及於民間。然欲使全面配給不成問題，惟有自促進棉布生產之高度着手。因此，棉花緊急增產中的紡織工業，必須全面加以調整與强化；大規模的紡織公司與小規模的紗織工塲，應不分軒輊地，很據其資本，勞力，設備，予以扶助與煦育；小規模之工塲，散處於內地各處者旣為最多，則基於「集腋成表」之理，凡有小型工塲覺感機械缺乏者，即當設法利用大規模的紡織公司因受電力限制而停止工作之機械，移至小型工塲，設法使用。此外，對於原料，資本，勞力之需給，尤須有通盤的調整計劃。如是而後棉花緊急增產以後之棉布生產，方足以言有計劃的擴充，棉布配給，方可望其有合理的供給。</p>

<h3>上海慈幼敎養院　兒童節偉大演出</h3>
<p>兒童節的首創者—中華慈幼協會，於今年第十三屆兒童節日，在自主辦的大興路上海慈幼敎賽院，舉行熱烈的慶祝典禮，並且有「女石揮」的話劇歌劇等演出。</p>
<p>下午三時，院子滿屋子都充滿了喜氣揚揚的來賓和男女孩子們，來賓大部分是捐款人和認養者，他們或她們看到自己認養的活活潑潑健康而聰敵的孩子，看到孩子們穿着整齊的童子軍裝，特製的艇形帽，向來賓和訪問者歡歡喜喜恭恭敬敬的行敬禮，俱是多麼高興啊！</p>
<p>慶祝大會開幕了，來賓席已經再也挨不進去了，多麽熱鬧！孩子們由「小樂隊」奏樂引導着，整隊入塲。</p>
<p>無比的熱烈和興奮</p>
<p>「我們以無比的熱烈和興奮來慶祝今天，慶祝中華民國的兒童的節日」，小主席，該院畢業生張月華小她流利的國語引起全院來賓的的眞。小主席强調指出中華慈幼協會在民國廿年呈請國府明定年年四月四日為兒童節終於廿一年獲准而正式規定的光榮意義，她指出在中華慈幼協會所主持的上海慈幼院內慶祝兒童節的特別意義。</p>
<p>康老滿臉緋紅</p>
<p>小姐主席的開會詞使該院現任主席林康侯光生高興得滿臉飛紅，笑得合不起嘴來，他上台讓楊上海慈幼敎養院這種培植人才的偉大成功。他說救濟敎養苦難兒童是何等艱苦的事，能像砂裏掬金般培植起幾個人材已是千萬之喜。可是該院數十年來在砂裏選出無數顆明珠和鑚右，並且把粒粒粗砂化煉成白金！他的話更打動了全院，不少善士更當塲增加認捐認養的數目！</p>
<p>節目開始了，小樂隊配音的兒童節歌會唱，「小兵隊」和「糊塗國王」的唱歌表情，「耕種」的歌詠，「貓和雀」「洋娃娃病了」的唱歌表情「祖國進行曲』的歌詠，都不像是孩子們的表演而是音樂院的大演出。特別是話劇「走」，「得救」，「壓迫」等的演出，無論在意識上，在表演上，在效果上，以及佈景道具等等，都不讓於大劇團，其中一如王友璞和張月華這幾個孩子演員的成功，遠非普通劇團的演出所可紫其項背，無怪大家稱張小如為「女石揮」了。</p>
<p>表演中的「疊羅漢」一節雖然是普通的體育表演，然而那敏捷的動作，健强的體格，整齊的服裝，愉快的精神，每一張紅實責圓股股的小臉，給人以多麼可愛可喜的印象！</p>
<p>在表演間，門鈴不停的響，送來了各界仁人善士的捐贈品，特別是實業家丁伯確，潘伯華，江聖鋸諸先生等的捐贈最多，一車車的玩具，文具，各種各樣的合物。今天丁先生還扶病偕夫人小姐來參加慶祝，他不僅認養了好幾位難兒，而且時時和孩子們通信。潘先生於辦實業的忙繁中，還　備着協助該院擴充敎養事業，以為國家民族造福。</p>
<p>敎養的負責人姚主任和張先生等幾位談起苦難兒童敎養事業尙待各方面更大的支持。據說中華茲幼協會勸募捐款，自上月十五日起，至今日得一百餘萬，距離二百萬元的目尙遠。她們說每認養兒童一名，每月約五百元，全年不過六千元，認養之後，這兒童便像你自己的孩子一樣，按期送上成續報告單及健康報告等，為着孩子，為着社曾國家，願各界善士多做點好事！</p>
<h3>新普育堂　收款报吿</h3>
<p>張禎祥君前來函稱：「小兒蛐月之期，承諸親友所賜儀款，又承賜禮物，一並折現湊成一萬元，茲將該款送上，耶乞代為移助新普育堂四千元，育嬰堂三千元，助產金三千元。」</p>

<h3>兩個兒童保育院　工讀並進·手腦並用</h3>
<p>第一院</p>
<p>在兒童保育第一院的操塲上，正有許多穿着監制服的兒童在晒太陽或遊戲着·這星只有一間廣廳，裏面很大又分為一室，一室的如敎室，辦公室，製鞋部，木工部，廠房，寢室等。在廣廳的書頭堆着一　小麥，這就是他們的代用食的一種，旁邊還有一隻大的廢子，院里的孩子九利用課餘和工餘的時間來自己磨麵和粥吃，一面是運動一面也是生產呢！後面的廚房有許多孩子正在農容草，洗碗筷或做其他的什麽事，後來關於膳食，他們是自己料理的</p>
<p>洗衣服他們是自己動手，並且作衣服也是不假，手他人呢！著院裏有成衣部，凡是自己喜歡這工作，再經師長考驗遇到，的確個性適於這工作，他們就開始學習起來，這部是由一位三十多歲的一位婦女指導的，有十幾個在學習，因為太多所以分爲上下午兩班有兩個已經完成了他們課業，可以自己動手剪裁了，更有的會踏縫衣機，而介紹到內衣廠去就業了。這成衣部也收接外面的工作，當進去的時候，案上正放着一件紫色旗袍尙未完工，他們這樣每月也能賺二三千元，可是如果提到他們「開張」時的資本呢？你們也許是很覺好笑的：僅僅五塊大洋，的確在五年前他們　些剪刀合，尺，綫，針等五塊錢是很夠了。</p>
<p>他們也有皮鞋出產，雖然學生還不能單獨的做一隻皮鞋，但是每一隻的皮鞋裏也都有他們的一些老李參戰理念，外面有些商店到這里來批發或訂貨呢！這里每月也有好幾千的進益，提到他的開辦費的不過五十元，用這錢買的是些，鞋煊刀·鐵錘·麻錢·釘子之類的東西，指導這些孩子的是一個皮匠師傳。木工部的指導者自然是一個木匠啦！這都開頭是一個銅板也沒有花，狍子·鋸子·錘子·鉗子等，都是這位老師帶來的，他的學生也就這樣赤手空拳的學了起來。</p>
<p>他們是工讀並進的，是手腦並用的，這也就是理想社會消滅勞心勞力界限，永不再見勞心這治人勞力者治於人的畸形現象的趨形啊！讀書的實際情形也和普通小學一樣，分六級六複式敎授制，國·算·常識都有，外國語暫時緩敎，六年級生有的下學期將進中學。</p>
<p>這第一院的用費照目前情形看是一年非六十萬不可的，然而僅僅呌幾個工作人員在外面奔走，張羅不到這個數目這必需各界的協助，他們並希望能多多募一些款子以便更多的收容一些貧苦的兒童。</p>
<p>第二院</p>
<p>兒童保育院第二院是在冷靜的南市劇園路上，他的四周很荒凉·到處都是斷瓦頺垣，操塲是很廣大的，正長着許多亂草，三五成羣的兒童穿着新的制眼在愉快的奔跑着，他们在享受一年一度的兒童節呢</p>
<p>近操塲的一幢房子里有會客室，敎員宿舍和女童宿舍一間見很大的房間只稀稀疏疏地放著幾張單人的小鐵床，被褥都　防得很整齊。這里也有醫療室。有女醫師爲他們診治些疥瘡，沙眼，痢疾，牙病等病症，由於一時設備的簡陋和藥品的昂貴他們是常常束手無策，不可能使兒童十分健康的。</p>
<p>一片蠶豆正在開著紫色的小花·放散着清淡的香氣，這就是兒童自己的菜國，他們不久就可以吃到禽獸栽植的果實了。在這菜或當中有一條磗舖的閏道，走過了這很長的角道就有有一排房子，那就是教室，男童宿舍飯廳和廚房。廚房很寬大，不過很是破舊，裏在有三四隻大缸中間醃著滿滿的白菜，還堆著很多的糖，這是他們現在所用的燃料。他們的吃也是極刻苦，經常是吃的素食，董菜每月才能綸到一次，每天三餐二次粥，一次飯，並且要陪以雜糧。飯廳這裏有兩大間，裏面放著長桌和長板凳，靜寂的沒有一個人。教室裏課桌等難任舊了點，但還整齊，這是他們自己修理的呢！四五各兒童圍在一團正在溫習他們的功課。牆上點著大楷小楷作文造句等的成績。樓上是男童的寢室，房間是更寬暢了，只五六個人就佔了一個很大的房間，然而這裏是沒有床的；他們是用草席舖在地板再放些被褥在上睡當然這和睡閣樓的人比較起來是好的多了</p>
<p>這所房子是很可以再容納二三百窮苦的兒童的，然而由於經費不足和米糧的成問題，他無法把工作開展起來，在這裏筆者不但大聲疾呼請各界人士對該院作金錢，藥品，圓書，校具等的捐輸，並且希望當局對於難童貧兒的食米，布匹，煤球等方面增加一些配給的數目，實在這也是刻不容緩事啊！</p>

        <h1>1944 - n93</h1>
<h3>"Miserliness" and "Enthusiasm"</h3>
<p>The police consumer cooperative in this city, since the police actively prepared and carried it out, will soon reach two sentences. Regarding the capital of 10 million yuan, they have also requested advances from all sectors of society and various industry trade associations, hoping to finalize it by April 10th, collect the funds, and then establish it. It is heard that some industry trade associations have recently held meetings to remit payments, while some associations are watching and declining. The situation with shops and wealthy individuals remains the same.</p>
<p>From an objective standpoint, we have repeatedly offered our humble opinions regarding the advance of funds. In short, the police bear the responsibility of maintaining public order. The level of service efficiency directly affects the quality of public security. And the quality of public security directly affects the tranquility of the entire city. Organizing a police consumer cooperative directly improves the lives of the police, and in short, it improves the efficiency of police service, increases the strength of maintaining public order, and maintains the tranquility of the entire city. This is not just empty theory, but a suitable fact, which should be commonly recognized by citizens who understand things slightly. Although, due to the deep-rooted habits of the foreign-managed patrol room in the past, the citizens' impression of the police is not satisfactory, but since the recovery of the concessions, many new talents in police administration and Allied experts have participated in the work, and there is indeed a gradual spirit of rectification. However, in fact, it cannot be changed in a short period of time. Therefore, we should adopt an attitude of not blaming the past and expecting the future, and jointly assist in solving the difficulties in the lives of the police, and then train them to become modern police, so that they can fulfill the important mission of maintaining public order. First, do your best to complete this task, and after the work is completed, then review the past and improve it. In this way, the purpose of completing the work can be achieved, and at the same time, the bad impressions of the past can also be eliminated. If, because of the bad phenomena in the past process, the goal of the entire work is denied, and it is not enthusiastically completed, then the result will be that the completion of the work is hopeless, and even the bad impressions in the past process will always exist and will not be eliminated. This result is certainly not the narrow attitude that those who hope to complete the entire work should adopt.</p>
<p>To put it more thoroughly, improving the lives of the police is not the goal, but the goal is to improve service efficiency after the lives of the police are improved, so that they can take on the responsibility of maintaining public order and protecting the tranquility of the citizens. Therefore, improving the lives of the police is a means, while ensuring public order is the goal. Because the patrol room had an unsatisfactory impression in the past, they are unwilling to improve the lives of the police. If the lives of the police cannot be improved, the incident itself is small, but the difficulty in ensuring the entire public order has a great impact. Of course, we are not saying that the lives of the police should be improved, and that the police's lack of service ethics can be different. This point is obviously listed, and we have to emphasize and point out to inform all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the industry trade associations and people from all walks of life who are still watching and hesitating will advance funds, with interest and guarantee, which is not a donation at all. We believe that the reason for whether you are willing to advance funds lies not in genuine powerlessness and difficulty, but in the difference between "miserliness" and "enthusiasm"!</p>
<h3>Eighty-seven enemy aircraft shot down in various places last month; Japanese Headquarters announced yesterday's army battle results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 5th: The integrated battle results of the Imperial Army attacking or intercepting enemy air forces in March are as follows: 1. Enemy losses: Chinese enemy aircraft shot down with force, (two of which have not been confirmed) and destroyed 32. 81 were shot down in Burma (23 of which have not been confirmed) and 51 were destroyed. 3 were shot down in Vietnam and Thailand. 130 were shot down in New Guinea (20 of which have not been confirmed) and 17 were destroyed. 98 were shot down in the Bougainville and Bismarck Islands and other places. The above totals 487 enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed (45 of which have not been confirmed). "Our losses": 44 aircraft did not return to base after bombing, 49 were damaged on land, totaling 93.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to today's announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters, the air combat results achieved by the Japanese road team in various battle lines in March were a total of 487 enemy aircraft shot down (including 45 that were unconfirmed). The number of Japanese aircraft lost also reached 93. Compared with the results in February, the number of aircraft shot down increased by 80. Moreover, due to the special circumstances of the Burmese battle line and the Bismarck Islands, the total number of enemy aircraft attacked in February was 21,044, and in March it was 18,329. Although the number decreased slightly from February to March, the number of enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed by the Japanese army increased sharply. This was all due to the hard work of the Japanese army's first-line troops, and the Japanese army's loss of aircraft was 80 in February and increased to 93 in March. The battle situation was quite tragic.</p>
<h3>Japanese troops in the Indo-Burma border occupied the Tadam Fortress and pursued and inflicted heavy damage on the British army.</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Indo-Burma front telegram: About a brigade of the British 24th Division, in the Kabaw Valley, held the Molei Fortress about 4 kilometers north of Molei a few days ago. After the position was captured by the Japanese army, the enemy was forced to retreat to the mountains in the northwest on the 1st after being pressured by the Japanese army from the north and south. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack and pursuit from the east, and finally broke into Tadam. The remnants of the enemy army were severely damaged, and the Japanese army completely occupied the area.</p>
<p>A certain base on the Indo-Burma border, 5th (Central News Agency) - About a brigade of the British 20th Division, after retreating westward to the mountains along the Tadam-Palel highway from Tadam, joined forces with about a brigade of the British 23rd Division stationed in its rear position, attempting to make a final struggle. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack from the east for this purpose. At the same time, another Japanese army controlled its retreat route and inflicted heavy damage on it. After losing its retreat route due to the Japanese army's attack, the enemy repeatedly launched meaningless counterattacks in an attempt to struggle to the death, but was still severely damaged after the Japanese army's attack.</p>
<p>The Myitkyina airport was bombed again</p>
<p>A certain base in Burma, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army's government rushed bomber squadrons twice bombed the newly established enemy airport about 40 kilometers from Myitkyina, the landing area of the enemy airborne troops, on the evening of the 3rd and at dawn on the 4th, destroying 4 enemy aircraft on the ground and 7 gliders, and setting them on fire. At the same time, the high-shooting machine gun positions around the airport were also heavily damaged. Afterwards, all Japanese aircraft returned to base safely.</p>
<p>The enemy intelligence team was uncovered</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - A certain base on the Burmese front, 5th telegram: The enemy intelligence unit of 200 men under the command of British Major Hicklem, etc., was rounded up by the Japanese army and special task force on the 14th of last month, and was recently executed by the Japanese army. According to reports, before the Japanese army captured Rangoon last spring, the intelligence unit used the dense forest area southeast of Toungoo as its stronghold to investigate the stationing of the Japanese army, the location of the airport, and the distribution of its forces, and planned to disrupt the public order in the area and collect intelligence. At the same time, Major Hicklem had been training spies for a year since last spring, and had repeatedly contacted the Calcutta Command Department by radio (these radios were transported by aircraft from Calcutta) since last summer. The weapons they were equipped with were only more than 30 war machine guns and box guns and hunting guns for self-defense. Therefore, the enemy's commando team that attempted to disrupt the rear positions of the Japanese army in Burma and the arrest of Hicklem this time were major losses for the enemy. From then on, the Japanese army no longer had to worry about the rear and could devote all its efforts to the offensive operations against India.</p>
<p>British and American sides express uneasiness</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from New Delhi: The Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Army Headquarters stated in its war report on the 4th that no new changes had occurred on the Indian front, but according to previous news, after the Japanese army north of Imphal completely cut off one of the supply routes of the British-Indian army, in order to further isolate Imphal, the surrounding offensive taken from the north and east seemed to be further strengthened. Reuters special correspondent on the 4th strongly stated that the tense situation on the northern front of Imphal was not optimistic, and the Japanese army's continued westward advance north of Imphal was no longer optimistic. Moreover, a United Press reporter also admitted to the defeat of the British army, saying that the British-Indian army had engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army in the dense timber area east of Imphal, and had no choice but to retreat to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army in Manipur, and had exhausted its forces too much. Moreover, the New York Times stated in its editorial on the 4th that it was greatly concerned about the success of the Japanese army in the Myitkyina battle, that the British army's attempt to retake Burma had failed, and even the political unrest pervading India could not be suppressed, and the battle situation in northeastern India had isolated Stilwell and increased it. Moreover, due to the repeated statements made by Chiang Te-la Pau-Sze, it further caused shaking.</p>
<p>Indians in Europe are extremely excited</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - After the Indian National Army began to attack India with the urgent assistance of the Japanese army, it was deeply moved by the Indian nationals living in Europe, and all hoped that the day of their motherland's independence would come as soon as possible, especially the "Free India League" in Berlin, Paris, and Bai Luhan Er, etc., were particularly eager for the independence of their motherland. Among them, 200 Indians who participated in the British army's operations on the Tunisian front and the Italian front and were captured by the German army expressed their belief that we are willing to organize the European troops of the Indian National Army, join the European front, and risk all dangers to go to the Burmese front to serve the country for the independence of India. Nambiar, the commander-in-chief of the troops stationed in Europe and the minister in charge of affairs, expressed his deep gratitude for this, and expressed his gratitude for the Japanese army's actions in attacking India this time. The Japanese government stated its fair attitude at the same time as the Japanese army entered India, saying that it would hand over the occupied areas to the rule of the Indian provisional government, which was completely different from the British government's false promise to grant independence to India after the war. Moreover, this fair measure taken by Japan left a very deep impression on the nationals of various countries in Europe. At the same time, Indian Minister of Affairs Nambiar, in addition to sending a telegram to Bose on behalf of his European comrades to congratulate him, made a speech at the Central Headquarters in Berlin on the 3rd, roughly saying that after the Japanese-Indian army entered India, the long-awaited Indian nationals immediately recognized the correctness of the policies adopted by Bose. The military and political assistance of the Japanese army to India was fair and just. At the same time, this fair and just arrangement by the Japanese army aroused great excitement among European comrades. Although the anti-Axis camp had made various propaganda about the war situation, the Indian people were not only not confused by it, but continued to join the Indian National Army, and their trust in the Axis camp's combat power was extremely strong. This was evidence that they firmly believed that the Japanese-Indian army would win the war against Britain, but before India has completed its independence, there are considerable difficulties. I am even more determined to strive to complete the construction of my motherland.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - In order to cooperate with the government in launching a campaign to collect waste metal, in order to achieve the Great East Asia War as soon as possible, it was decided to publicize and guide the collection of waste metal at the liaison meeting held at the association at 11:00 am on the 5th.

<h3>Governor Chen of Guangdong died after being attacked by thugs; the Central Government ordered the military and police to strictly arrest the murderer.</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - After the news of the death of Governor Chen of Guangdong Province and Pacification Director being attacked by thugs arrived in Beijing, the Central Government deeply mourned that Governor Chen had served in Guangdong for four years and made outstanding contributions. He also deeply hated the despicable behavior of the Chongqing side in instigating thugs. In addition to telegraphing condolences, he also ordered the military and police authorities in Guangdong to strictly arrest the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency) - Chen Yaozu, Governor of Guangdong Province and Pacification Director of Guangzhou, was shot by thugs and Zheng threw grenades while passing through Wende Road on official business at 6:00 pm on April 4th, causing serious injuries and dying at 1:55 am on the 5th due to his injuries. The duties of Governor of Guangdong Province are temporarily performed by Wang, the chief of police. The duties of Pacification Director are temporarily performed by Huang Keming, the chief of staff of the Pacification Commissioner's Office.</p>
<p>(Another telegram) Governor Chen of Guangdong Province was attacked by thugs and died of his injuries. All parties expressed their anger at the violent actions of the opposition elements. The Japanese South China Army authorities made the following announcement on the 5th at 12:00: Governor Chen of this province was attacked and injured by thugs at about 6:10 pm on the 4th while passing through Wende Lu in the room, and was immediately admitted to the hospital for treatment. He died of his injuries at 1:55 am on the 5th. At this moment, both China and Japan are working together to search for the criminals. This act of violence is determined to have been committed by opposition elements on the Chongqing side, which is extremely regrettable.</p>
<p>(Another telegram) After Governor Chen was assassinated, Police Chief Wang and Chief of Staff Huang of the Pacification Commissioner's Office made the following statements: The soldiers and civilians of the whole province deeply mourn the death of Governor Chen for the country. Governor Chen and Director had been in office for four years, and their contribution to pacifying production was great. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he has worked even harder to consolidate the rear and cooperate in the war, which made him jealous of the enemy, and therefore died for the country. He is indeed a sacrifice of the Greater East Asia War. While deeply mourning, my colleagues are deeply encouraged! We will certainly inherit his ambition, redouble our efforts, and continue to struggle to complete the mission of revitalizing China and protecting Asia.</p>
<p>(Another telegram) A brief biography of Governor Chen Yaozu: Chen Yaozu, courtesy name Dezhao, is from Xinhui, Guangdong. He is 52 years old and graduated from the Engineering Department of Cornell University in the United States. He has served as the director of the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway Bureau, the director of the Construction Department of the Guangdong Provincial Government, the director of the Finance Department of the Ministry of Railways, the director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau, the director of the Guangdong Highway Office, and a member of the Guangdong Provincial Government. After the National Government returned to the capital in 1919, the Provincial Government resumed provincial rule in May of the same year, and the people's agent served as the chairman of the Provincial Government and the director of the Construction Department. He was officially removed from the position of chairman of the Provincial Government in November of the same year. In January of the 32nd year, the provincial government was reorganized and changed to the position of governor, and also served as the director of the Guangzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office. His survivors include his wife Huang Xiulan and three sons.</p>

<h3>Definitely not the Offensive Line of War Life</h3>
<p>Suspension of Affairs</p>
<p>This extraordinary measure in the current war requires government officials to first emulate and emulate. It is easy to see from the government's intention to set these guidelines. These guidelines consist of ten items, which include suspending peacetime or long-term leisure affairs and undertakings. The wax candle well wipes the two price increases of Peng Mule Cook Shih Bimi twice. However, the two-fold sophistication of this is more directly required for the expansion of the teaching team than for the ordinary officials, and there are still many people to bear. The government is always involved in this, and it is appropriate to stop the various affairs and undertakings of the official offices and public groups, or to substantially reduce them, for a year or so.</p>
<p>Sure Reward and Punishment</p>
<p>For the price of official history, the reward and punishment control, the frying revolution on December 31st, the service order for the official changes during the extraordinary war, the punishment and punishment order for civil servants, and other four orders will be implemented from January 4th. Its fun is not to pay others, official affairs, especially companies and inlays that have a relationship with the current situation, etc. Strive to improve the efficiency of affairs, so that hunger will be on duty and there will be no regrets. The government, in order to inspire this order, requires the people to decorate Junji's cooperation. Regarding the strengthening of posture, the thoroughness of that by calling and drinking must be intensified, and the natural improvement of more obvious branches and spears is also to bear the meaning of dismantling the two.</p>
<p>Reduction of Holidays in Official Offices - The reduction of holidays in official offices is to make continuous original desires. If the ball is walking, there is a strong desire for the power of the vast, there can not be a day or an hour of formation code. From now on, the official offices, state dates, and festivals will all be business work. Driving in Xu Ding or Ye Korea, the villainous affairs of the people who are engaged in direct relationship with this item can not be handled outside at any time. Only the system of calling the holiday of Lishou within Huai, for example, people who do things on the day of the house period, take a day off another day.

<h3>Carpathian Battles Hold Important Position; Historical Facts Favor Defenders</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Haitong News Agency: Observing the current situation of the major battle on the southern route of the Eastern Front, the Carpathian Mountain range will hold a considerably important position. During World War I, attacks from the east were blocked here. In late September 1914, the Soviet vanguard pursued the Austro-Hungarian army into the valley, but progress was slow. From the winter of 1914 until the spring of the following year, they could only seize a few key strongholds. Soviet casualties were heavy. In the autumn of 1914, the situation for Germany and Austria-Hungary was quite precarious. The Austro-Hungarian army was very weak on the Carpathian highlands, and the enemy's offensive was fierce. At this time, German reinforcements arrived to help, skillfully using the dangerous terrain of the mountains to fight the enemy, turning the crisis into safety. Historical facts show that the German army's fighting power in this war is much stronger than that of the Austro-Hungarian army in the past. German generals can calmly deal with the enemy. It should be known that the Soviet army's sharpest weapon is the tank, but in mountain warfare, tanks cannot easily exert their power.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Intensifies Pressure Downstream of the Dniester River</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: The climate on the southern route of the Eastern Front has changed, with wind and snow, so the war has slowed down, but there are still fierce battles in Outer Nistria. The Soviet army is advancing towards Tiligul from the lower reaches of the White Bug River, and the battle is currently underway. The enemy attempted to cross the Tiligul River near Novaya and Oilyu, but failed. German counterattacks defeated enemy troops who had reached the west bank of the river. The Soviet Union continues to apply pressure downstream of the Dniester River from Verkhneslavka, aiming to cut off the German army fighting in the Odessa area, but the enemy cannot prevent the German army's planned westward retreat. It is expected that the German army will use Oilyusa as a base to conduct a strong resistance in the defenses south of the city. In the area between the Dniester and Prut rivers, the enemy attempted to cut off the railway between Kishinev and Iasi, but failed completely after facing strong German resistance. The enemy's progress towards the lower reaches of the Prut River and the Danube Delta was therefore blocked. Romanian divisions launched a strong counteroffensive in the middle reaches of the Prut River, repelling the enemy's offensive, so the enemy's progress towards Iasi achieved nothing.</p>
<p>Three Important Cities Under Siege</p>
<p>The Soviet army on the western section of the front continues to advance, but its vanguard is blocked near Stanislaviv and Kokomya. The Soviet attempt to break through from Brody towards Lviv was also blocked by German defensive fire. The battle for the fortified cities of Ternopol, Brody, and Kovel is still developing. The battle for Pskov on this route continues. In Monday's battle, the German army won a complete victory.</p>
<p>German-Hungarian Cooperation to Defend European Fortress</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: The Soviet Union's psychological warfare against Romania, with the assistance of Britain and the United States, is a kind of inappropriate goal. The enemy attempts to use the military development on the Romanian border to make propaganda saying that, from a military point of view, Romania has been abandoned by Germany, so the Romanian army's continued resistance is not only a meaningless sacrifice, but also hinders the possibility of a solution. However, the German command's handling of the Hungarian incident shows that the German army attaches importance to Southeastern Europe. Germany will do its best to counter the military and political interference in one corner of the enemy's European fortress. In military terms, the German side believes that the Soviet army's advance can be blocked and lost territory can be recovered by strengthening cooperation through German-Romanian joint bloodshed.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Has No Territorial Ambition Towards Romania, Molotov Declares</h3>
<p>Moscow, 5th (Central News Agency) – Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with a group of foreign journalists on the evening of the 2nd to announce the movements of the Soviet army in the southern part of the Eastern Front. This was the first time that the Foreign Minister had made a statement to a group of foreign reporters since the start of the war. The gist of it is as follows: The Soviet army, having reached the Prut River, is pursuing the German-Romanian army and is crossing the river at several locations, successively advancing into Romanian territory. It is also stressed that the Soviet government has no intention of acquiring Romanian territory, nor of changing Romania's current social organization. He also said that before issuing this statement, the Soviet Union had informed the British and American governments and obtained their agreement.</p>
<h3>Romanian Capital Bombed for the First Time; Hungarian Capital Bombed Again</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: On the afternoon of the 4th, German and Romanian fighter planes engaged in a fierce air battle with American bombers over Romania. At that time, the American bomber formation suffered heavy losses, and the invading enemy planes were also subjected to extremely fierce anti-aircraft fire, especially densely around the outskirts of the Romanian capital. American planes indiscriminately dropped explosive and incendiary bombs on the Romanian capital, causing some damage to residential areas.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: At least forty-four anti-Axis planes were shot down yesterday over the Romanian capital, of which thirty-two were shot down by Romanian fighter planes, and it is reported that several were also shot down by Bulgarian fighter planes and anti-aircraft fire, but the exact number is not yet known. However, the wreckage of thirty-five planes has already been found in Romanian territory.</p>
<p>According to Haitong News Agency, British officials announced: Anti-Axis bombers bombed the Romanian capital yesterday. This is the first time the Romanian capital has been bombed, and the third time in six days that a Balkan capital has been bombed.</p>
<p>Budapest, 5th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: According to official announcements, the enemy launched a terrifying air raid on the Hungarian capital on the night of April 3rd. Fortunately, land air defense teams and fighter planes cooperated to defend the city, so the bombing did not have a large effect.</p>
<p>Swiss Airspace Violated Again</p>
<p>Bern, 5th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Officials announced today that yesterday afternoon, several planes of unknown nationality violated Switzerland's neutrality. These planes flew into Swiss territory from Neuhausen am Rheinfall, then crossed over Vallerobe and left.</p>
<h3>British Army Suffers 660,000 Casualties in Four Years of War</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: Churchill announced in the British Lower House that the number of British army deaths and injuries in the first four years of the war, of which the Indian army suffered the greatest losses, accounted for 67% of the total imperial losses. Among the 1,590,000 casualties, Indian army officers and soldiers lost 109,800 men. Australia was second, with 74,338 deaths, injuries, and missing. Third was New Zealand with 25,717 men, South Africa with 23,825 men, Canada with 19,697 men, other colonies with 25,786 men, and the British mainland with 387,996 men. British merchant marine personnel lost 30,314 men.</p>
<h3>Eden's Resignation to Be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: According to reliable sources, Foreign Secretary Eden's decision to resign has been made, but it will take several days to be officially announced. His successor is expected to be Lord Cranborne, the Dominions Secretary. Eden will remain a member of the War Cabinet and Speaker of the House of Commons, and may also serve concurrently as Deputy Minister of International Affairs.</p>
<h3>Tegol Takes Office as Commander of North African Army</h3>
<p>Geneva, 5th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: The "French Committee of National Liberation" decided yesterday to have Tegol command the committee's three armed forces. This decision was passed at a special meeting attended by the committee's new Communist members.</p>
<h3>America Applies Economic Pressure to Turkey</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) – After the breakdown of the British-Turkish military conference, the British government immediately prohibited the export of military supplies to Turkey. According to the Washington dispatches of the Times and the Daily Telegraph, it is reported that the American government, also based on the Lend-Lease Act, has stopped exporting oil and other materials to Turkey. Under the major premise of cooperation between Britain and the United States, strengthening diplomatic and economic pressure on the Turkish government is a trend that is bound to occur. The Times also commented on this in a special article, saying that although the United States has not yet officially acknowledged the above-mentioned events, the American government is observing the Turkish government's attitude towards the anti-Axis camp, so this measure has been taken. In addition, if neither of the countries involved in the trade agreement notifies of its termination by the end of April, it can continue to be effective afterwards. Although the American authorities have not confirmed the termination of the treaty, their hope to abandon the agreement is an undeniable fact.</p>
<h3>Complete List of Vichy Government</h3>
<p>Paris, 5th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: After the French government appointed Chassaigne as Minister of Supply and Matte as Commissioner of Agriculture, there are no vacant positions in the government. The complete list of the Vichy government is as follows:</p>

<p>Head of Government, Prime Minister, Minister of Interior, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Information: Laval</p>
<p>"State Secretaries with Ministerial Rank": Minister of Justice and Keeper of the Seals: Gabolde; Minister of Finance and Economy: Cathala; Minister of Education: Ripert; Minister of Industrial Production and Transport, Minister of Aviation: Bichelonne; Minister of Labor and National Mobilization: Déat; Minister of Public Health and Family: Grasset; State Secretary to the Head of Government: Marquet; Brinon</p>
<p>"State Secretaries without Ministerial Rank": Minister of Defense (including Army and Air Force): General Bridoux; Minister of Navy and Colonies: Admiral Platon; Minister of Information and Propaganda: Tilliot; Minister of Interior: Le Mée; Minister of Supply: Chassaigne; Chief of Staff to the Head of Government: Guérard</p>
<h3>Admission of the Badoglio Government Exposes New Weaknesses in the Anti-Axis Alliance</h3>
<p>Compared with its positive attitude towards the Balkans, Poland, and North Africa, the Soviet Union's policy towards Italy is more passive, as if it were completely entrusting Italy to the sphere of influence of Britain and the United States and expressing an attitude of indifference. Therefore, taking advantage of the Soviet Union's passive attitude, Britain and the United States quickly engaged in military and diplomatic work towards Italy during the period when the Soviet Union was busy attacking on the Eastern Front, attempting to bring Italy into their own pockets.</p>
<p>Purpose of Granting the Italian Fleet to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>When the US President announced on March 3 that one-third of the Italian fleet would be granted to the Soviet Union, the British media expressed great surprise that Britain had not announced it at the same time and had not even been notified in advance. This is of course the inevitable trend in the attitude of Britain and the United States arbitrarily disposing of other countries. But why did Roosevelt suddenly make this announcement? This inevitably creates a strange impression.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters Moscow dispatch on the 15th, negotiations between the Soviet Union and Badoglio to begin diplomatic relations began on March 6, and Roosevelt's announcement was made during the preparatory negotiations between Moscow and Badoglio. Was Roosevelt's announcement intended to give the impression that Moscow was demanding one-third of the Italian fleet? Or did it indicate that Britain and the United States were prepared to concede to this point? It is difficult to say for the moment. But Roosevelt clearly intended to undermine the negotiations between Moscow and Badoglio.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has adopted a realistic diplomatic policy in this war, so it does not want to launch a communist revolution in Italy. Nor does it support the anti-monarchist parties led by Sforza and Croce to plot to replace the fascist regime of Badoglio. This is only because the internal situation in Italy is chaotic and it is difficult to predict its future. Judging from past history, the result of the Italian communist movement after the last World War was the creation of Mussolini's fascist regime, so the Soviet Union dared not act rashly.</p>
<p>Stalin's Realistic Diplomacy</p>
<p>The reason why the Soviet Union publicly recognized the Badoglio government today is that the situation in southern Italy has stabilized and the recognition of the Soviet Union can strengthen the Badoglio government. This is also a manifestation of Stalin's realistic diplomatic policy. Stalin advocated: "Do not instigate communist revolutions in other countries, but expect countries around the world to establish regimes that adopt pro-Soviet policies."</p>
<p>The special significance of the application of this general Soviet diplomatic question lies in the recognition of the Badoglio government this time. The Soviet Union took this action unilaterally, without consulting Britain and the United States beforehand. As a result, Britain and the United States were greatly alarmed and expressed disapproval of the Soviet Union. Moscow took the opportunity to launch a diplomatic offensive against Italy.</p>
<p>In the international arena, according to a Naples correspondent of the London Times, the anti-Axis Italian Administrative Committee has hardly held any meetings and has no activity. Therefore, although Britain and the United States constantly contacted the Badoglio government through the military operations headquarters, the Soviet Union and the North African regime, which participated in the Italian Administrative Committee, believed that the committee had gradually lost contact with Italy. The European Advisory Commission in London also does not attach importance to the committee. This is the result of Britain and the United States wanting to monopolize the work on Italy. The Soviet Union's recognition of the Badoglio government is a fierce attack on Britain and the United States' desire to monopolize Italy.</p>
<p>Following the Government-in-Exile</p>
<p>After the Badoglio government obtained Moscow's recognition, it immediately severed relations with Finland and at the same time restored diplomatic relations with the Chetnik government of Yugoslavia. The governments-in-exile of Yugoslavia and Greece, which had fled to Cairo, also followed the Badoglio government and intended to establish diplomatic relations with Moscow.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's purpose in recognizing the Badoglio government is to establish pro-Soviet regimes everywhere, which is a manifestation of Stalin's broad diplomatic policy and the strengthening of the Soviet Union's political offensive in the Mediterranean. The method adopted by Britain and the United States is not to take a clear attitude towards other countries, standing in the middle of the anti-revolutionaries and radicals, without losing the sympathy of both sides, and calling it a democratic method; the Soviet Union is different, based on power politics and using decisive methods.</p>
<p>Neutral countries have adopted a passive attitude of prolonged observation towards the Soviet Union's actions this time. This is regarded as a natural reaction by the Soviet Union. But the Soviet Union will not therefore seize the initiative in Italian diplomacy and arbitrarily control Italy. Britain and the United States have already built strong bridgeheads against the Soviet Union along the Mediterranean coast in Lisbon, Algiers, Cairo, and Turkey. Therefore, the Soviet Union's advance this time, like the Soviet Union's advance into North Africa last fall, will allow Britain and the United States to gradually build up their own solid traditional territories, and it has its special significance.</p>
<p>Britain has now sent Sir Noel Charles to the Badoglio government to counter the Soviet Union. The embarrassment of Britain and the United States and the new weaknesses of the Anglo-American-Soviet alliance, which are attracting worldwide attention, are trying to cover up, and are exposed before the eyes of people around the world.

<h3>Spring Sacrificial Ceremony to Confucius Solemnly Held at the Confucius Temple Yesterday; Secretary-General Wu and Mayor Di Presided over the Ceremony</h3>

The city government authorities specially held a sacrificial ceremony to Confucius at the Dacheng Hall of the Confucius Temple in the South City to commemorate the great spirit of the most sacred and wise teacher, and to promote Chinese culture. Mayor Chen (represented by Secretary-General Wu) presided over the ceremony, accompanied by Director Lin Jiongan of the City Education Bureau, Director Lu Ying of the Second Police Bureau, Director Yuan Houzhi of the City Finance Bureau, and Director Sun Wuqi of the City Social Welfare Bureau. Section chiefs of the city government and representatives of various organizations and institutions participated in the ceremony, as well as several hundred students from various schools. The Second Police Bureau band played music, and members of the bureau's Special Service Brigade and the Seventh District Self-Defense Corps Headquarters, as well as the Municipal First Middle School Youth Corps, were dispatched to maintain order at the scene.</p>
<p>Solemn Ceremony</p>
<p>The interior of the hall was simply decorated. Offerings were placed in front of the tablet of the teacher Confucius and the tablets of the sages on both sides. Red candles were burning brightly, and offerings of fruit, tea, and other items were made. At exactly 10 o'clock, the solemn ceremony began. With the sound of music, the chief celebrant took his place, the accompanying celebrants took their places, and the assisting celebrants took their places. Everyone stood at attention, sang the national anthem, and bowed three times to the teacher Confucius in the most respectful salute. The chief and accompanying celebrants then presented offerings separately. After the music was played,</p>
<p>Respectfully Reading the Sacrificial Text</p>
<p>The sacrificial text read: "On the 5th day of the 4th month of the year Jia Shen, the 33rd year of the Republic of China, Chen Gongbo, the Mayor of Shanghai Special City, together with his staff, reverently offer flowers and clear wine to the Most Sacred Teacher Confucius, saying: O Teacher, your laws are eternal, your way surpasses all kings, your virtue is united with heaven and earth, your brightness is the same as the sun and moon. You gathered the great achievements of sacred learning, truly unprecedented for the people. Your way lies in loyalty and reciprocity, adapting to the times, passing on the sixteen-character legacy, opening up thousands of years of culture. The sounds of bells and drums fill the halls, harmonious and elegant songs illuminate the grand ceremony. Now, at this spring sacrifice, we respectfully prepare the ritual, and together with our subordinates, express our admiration. The spring breeze warms all things, like your kindness in nurturing and educating. The rain of transformation knows the time, offering a song of harmony and praise. We respectfully follow the rituals to honor the Resurgent Yan Hui, the Ancestral Sage Zeng Shen, the Transmitter Sage Zisi, and the Second Sage Mencius, and hope that our offerings will resonate." Then, Secretary-General Wu gave a speech.</p>
<p>Chief Celebrant's Speech</p>
<p>City Government Secretary-General Wu, representing Mayor Chen, presided over the ceremony and gave a speech, saying: "Ladies and gentlemen, the Shanghai Special City Government is holding a spring sacrifice to the Most Sacred Confucius. I am greatly honored to represent the Mayor in participating in this ceremony. The greatness of Confucius is something that you all already know. I would like to briefly describe my feelings as follows: Confucius's doctrines are unchanging throughout the ages, unlike general philosophies of society. I have also studied ordinary philosophy, and it is only suitable for the time of its creation, unlike the teachings of Confucius, which have been passed down for a long time, remaining unchanged for thousands of years. As far as I know, the thoughts and personalities of many great people in the world are inconsistent, but Confucius's teachings are united with his personality. Confucius's knowledge has permeated modern national organizations. We know that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are based on Confucius's teachings. It can be seen that the teachings of Confucius, thousands of years ago, contain profound truths." Finally, after singing the Confucius Memorial Song, a photo was taken, and the ceremony concluded with the sound of music.</p>

<h3>Pacific Operations: Enemy's Absurd Propaganda; Minister Matsushima Reports His Views</h3>
<p>U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox claimed on the 31st of last month that the U.S. had more than 50 aircraft carriers participating in Pacific operations. According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 2nd, U.S. naval task forces had fiercely attacked the Caroline Islands. Their exaggerated propaganda has long lost credibility both internally and externally. Therefore, the eyes and ears of the world are focused on the true situation of the Pacific war. On the 4th, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that six enemy ships had been sunk or destroyed south of the Caroline Islands, completely shattering the enemy's fabricated propaganda. Commander Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China shared his views yesterday (the 5th) as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy Fighting Strength Is Extremely Weak</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox boasted that 50 aircraft carriers had been dispatched to the Pacific. However, most of the aircraft carriers currently used by the U.S. Navy are rapidly built auxiliary carriers with extremely weak combat power. Since the end of March, the U.S. mobile forces seem to have deployed a considerable force for a counterattack in the Western Caroline Islands. The first day of this battle was a very difficult night battle, after which there were repeated night air battles between the two sides. The actual results achieved by our side are probably more than what was announced by the Imperial Headquarters. Therefore, the enemy's reports have often been relatively subdued, especially regarding the damage to ships, which has been kept secret. The reason why the enemy has repeatedly carried out this unreasonable counteroffensive operation before its war preparations are fully completed is to rapidly advance its air bases in the South Pacific and gain a foothold in the Philippines or China. This would extend the dying life of the Chongqing government, at the same time cutting off the transportation lines between the Japanese mainland and the South Seas, disrupting the unity of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Decisive Battle Opportunity Gradually Matures</p>
<p>Why is the enemy so anxious? It is because the communication of the anti-Axis camp is deteriorating, especially due to the extremely tense domestic situation in the United States. However, on the one hand, the enemy's use of the land bases of the Marshall and Atmiralty Islands, or driving the mobile force, in an attempt to break into our inner defense line, cannot be ignored in the progress of the war. The enemy will use all means to get closer to our homeland defense line, and we must not neglect to be vigilant against this. In order to deal with this counteroffensive by the enemy, preparations for the decisive battle of the frontline air force and fleet are being strengthened day by day. The timing of the decisive battle has gradually matured. The intense skirmishes that are being repeatedly conducted now are actually the prelude to the formal naval battle. During this period, our side must also be prepared to endure considerable losses, because bold tactics are necessary to achieve the final goal. It is hoped that the people of the Axis powers, especially the people of the Greater East Asia countries, should not be misled by the enemy's recklessness, but should always maintain a calm mind, work hard to enhance their combat power, and not miss the good opportunity to destroy Britain and the United States. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<h3>Group A Football League Nears Conclusion; Donghua Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>The Match Against the First Police Team Is Insignificant to the Overall Situation</p>
<p>The Group A Football League is nearing its end. Donghua has won all nine matches and has already won the championship. Only the match between Donghua and the First Police Team remains, and the outcome is no longer significant to the overall situation. Because Lianyi withdrew, the First Police Team is expected to win the second place. The Portuguese Merchants team is currently ranked fourth, but they still have two matches against the Three Provinces team, which they are sure to win, so the team should be able to surpass the Overseas Chinese Association and rank third. The Jewish team is fifth, and the Three Provinces team is at the bottom. In addition to the Portuguese Merchants team's match against the Three Provinces team this week, there are only two matches left in this group, and it will all be completed. The Group B and C matches will also end soon. After that, various cup matches will begin. Also, because the Shanghai United Stadium suffered heavy losses in the match between Donghua and the Overseas Chinese Association last week, it will be difficult to hold matches there again, so they are trying to find a solution. Here is a record of the Group A situation:</p>
<h3>Public Basketball Tonight: Zhongbei vs. All-Stars</h3>

Starting at 6 o'clock tonight, there will be four more games. In the first game of Group B, Tianguang will play against Zihong, and Qianglian will play against Fashang. In the first game of Group A, the ever-victorious Zhongbei will face the All-Stars. The All-Stars are a newly formed team, and their strength is still far from Zhongbei.

<p>Economic Circle　Economic Comments</p>
<h3>Emergency Increase in Cotton Production</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan passed the emergency cotton production plan on April 4th. The draft was based on the opinions jointly reviewed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, and the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee. It must be thorough and meticulous and in line with implementation, which is undoubtedly. We don't need to discuss how to urgently increase cotton production any further.</p>
<p>What we want to say is that after the emergency cotton production plan is passed, it must be implemented without delay. After implementation, we must actively seek to establish close links with the textile industry to promote a high degree of cotton cloth production.</p>
<p>On the eve of cotton cloth rationing, we must reiterate the cotton cloth rationing system, that is, the centralized rationing and sale of cotton cloth must not hinder the needs of the people while adapting to the needs of the military. Therefore, cotton cloth rationing must be made popular among the people. However, to make comprehensive rationing not a problem, we can only start from promoting a high degree of cotton cloth production. Therefore, the textile industry in the emergency increase in cotton production must be comprehensively adjusted and strengthened. Large-scale textile companies and small-scale yarn weaving factories should be supported and nurtured equally, based on their capital, labor, and equipment. There are the most small-scale factories scattered throughout the interior, so based on the principle of "gathering axillary fur into a robe," those small factories that feel a lack of machinery should find ways to use the machinery of large-scale textile companies that have stopped working due to power restrictions and move it to small factories. In addition, there must be a comprehensive adjustment plan for the supply of raw materials, capital, and labor. Only in this way can the planned expansion of cotton cloth production after the emergency increase in cotton production be guaranteed, and the rational supply of cotton cloth rationing can be expected.</p>

<p>Children's Day Special Issue 3</p>
<h3>Shanghai Ciyou Education and Care Center: Great Performance for Children's Day</h3>
<p>The initiator of Children's Day - the China Ciyou Association, held a warm celebration ceremony at the Shanghai Ciyou Education and Care Center on Daxing Road, which it independently manages, on this year's 13th Children's Day, and also featured stage plays and operas such as "Female Shi Hui."</p>
<p>At 3 p.m., the courtyard and rooms were filled with cheerful guests and boys and girls. Most of the guests were donors and sponsors. They were so happy to see the lively, healthy, and intelligent children they sponsored, to see the children wearing neat scout uniforms, special boat-shaped hats, and happily and respectfully saluting the guests and visitors!</p>
<p>The celebration began, and there was no room left in the guest seating. How lively! The children, led by the "small orchestra," entered the arena in formation.</p>
<p>Unparalleled Warmth and Excitement</p>
<p>"We celebrate today with unparalleled warmth and excitement, celebrating the Children's Day of the Republic of China," said the young chairman, Zhang Yuehua, a graduate of the school. Her fluent Mandarin caused the Zhen of all the guests in the hospital. The young chairman emphasized the glorious significance that the China Ciyou Association presented to the National Government in the 20th year of the Republic of China to designate April 4th of each year as Children's Day and was finally approved in the 21st year and officially stipulated. She pointed out the special significance of celebrating Children's Day in the Shanghai Ciyou Hospital, which is hosted by the China Ciyou Association.</p>
<p>Old Kang's Face Was Crimson</p>
<p>The opening speech of the young chairman made the current chairman of the hospital, Lin Kanghou Guangsheng, so happy that his face was crimson and he couldn't stop smiling. He went on stage to let Yang Shanghai Ciyou Education and Care Center know about the great success of cultivating talents. He said that it is a very difficult thing to rescue and educate children in distress, and it is a great joy to be able to cultivate a few talents like scooping gold from the sand. However, the hospital has selected countless pearls and diamonds from the sand for decades and has refined every grain of rough sand into white gold! His words moved the whole hospital even more, and many benefactors increased the amount of their recognition and sponsorship on the spot!</p>
<p>The program began. The Children's Day song concert with the "small orchestra" accompaniment, the singing expressions of "Little Soldiers" and "Confused King," the singing of "Cultivation," the singing expressions of "Cat and Sparrow" and "Doll Sick," and the singing of "Patriotic March" did not seem like children's performances but rather a grand performance by a music academy. In particular, the performances of the stage plays "Walking," "Salvation," and "Oppression," whether in terms of consciousness, performance, effect, or scenery and props, were not inferior to those of a large theater troupe. The success of several child actors, such as Wang Youpu and Zhang Yuehua, far surpassed the performances of ordinary theater troupes. No wonder everyone called Zhang Xiao as "Female Shi Hui."</p>
<p>Although the "Stacking Arhats" section of the performance was a common physical education performance, the agile movements, strong physique, neat clothing, and happy spirit, every small, red, rounded face, gave people such a lovely and pleasing impression!</p>
<p>During the performance, the doorbell kept ringing, and donations from philanthropists from all walks of life were sent, especially the donations from industrialists Ding Boque, Pan Bohua, and Jiang Shengju, etc., were the most numerous, with carts of toys, stationery, and various kinds of goods. Today, Mr. Ding also came to participate in the celebration with his wife and daughter despite his illness. He not only sponsors several orphans, but also communicates with the children from time to time. Mr. Pan is busy with business, but he is also prepared to assist the hospital in expanding its educational and care business for the benefit of the country and the nation.</p>
<p>The person in charge of education and care, Director Yao and Mr. Zhang, etc., talked about the fact that the education and care of distressed children still needs greater support from all parties. It is said that the China Ciyou Association has raised more than one million yuan in donations since the 15th of last month to today, which is still far from the goal of two million yuan. They said that each sponsorship of a child costs about 500 yuan per month, which is only 6,000 yuan per year. After the sponsorship, the child is like your own child, and achievement reports and health reports are sent on a regular basis. For the sake of the children, for the sake of the community and the country, I hope that philanthropists from all walks of life will do more good deeds!</p>
<h3>Xin Puyu Hall Receipt Report</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zhenxiang sent a letter saying: "For the full moon of my son, I have received congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends, and I have converted them into cash to make up 10,000 yuan. Now I send the money and ask you to transfer 4,000 yuan to Xin Puyu Hall, 3,000 yuan to the Nursery Hall, and 3,000 yuan to the midwifery fund."</p>
<p>Daily receipts for Xin Puyu Hall donations: anonymous receipt 6703 donates 50 yuan, Zhang Zhenxiang donates 4,000 yuan, Li Fuyang donates 1,000 yuan, Li Bangan donates 1,000 yuan (check), Huang Fulin donates 500 yuan, Zuo Genfa donates 200 yuan, Yao Junyao donates 20 yuan, Heji donates 250 yuan, for a total of 7,470 yuan. Miao Jechen 100 yuan, Chen Rongfang Laoer Yao Wu Hui 3,806 yuan.</p>
<h3>Two Children's Homes: Combining Work and Study, Engaging Both Hands and Brain</h3>
<p>First Home</p>
<p>On the playground of the First Children's Home, many children in matching uniforms are sunbathing or playing. This place has only one large hall, which is very spacious and divided into several rooms, such as classrooms, offices, a shoe-making department, a carpentry department, a workshop, and dormitories. A pile of wheat is stacked at the head of the hall, which is one of their staple foods. Next to it is a large millstone. The children in the home use their spare time after class and work to grind flour and make porridge for themselves, which is both exercise and production! In the kitchen at the back, many children are chopping grass, washing dishes, or doing other chores. They manage their own meals.</p>
<p>They wash their own clothes and make their own clothes without relying on others! There is a clothing department in the home. Anyone who likes this work, and passes the teachers' evaluation, proving they are indeed suited to the work, can start learning. This department is supervised by a woman in her thirties, and there are more than a dozen students learning. Because there are too many, they are divided into morning and afternoon shifts. Two students have already completed their coursework and can cut and sew on their own. Some can even operate sewing machines and have been introduced to underwear factories for employment. The clothing department also accepts outside work. When I entered, there was a purple cheongsam on the table that was not yet completed. In this way, they can earn two or three thousand yuan per month. But if you ask about the capital when they "opened shop"? You might find it very amusing: only five silver dollars. Indeed, five years ago, five dollars was enough to buy some scissors, rulers, thread, needles, and so on.</p>
<p>They also produce leather shoes. Although the students cannot make a complete shoe on their own yet, each shoe contains some of their hard work and participation. Some shops come here to wholesale or place orders! This place also makes several thousand in profit each month. The opening fee was only fifty yuan, which was used to buy shoe lasts, knives, hammers, hemp twine, nails, and the like. A cobbler teaches the children. The instructor of the carpentry department is naturally a carpenter! It didn't cost a penny to start. The plane, saw, hammer, pliers, etc., were all brought by the teacher, and his students learned with their bare hands.</p>
<p>They combine work and study, using both hands and brains. This is the trend towards an ideal society where the boundaries between mental and manual labor are eliminated, and the distorted phenomenon of mental laborers ruling over manual laborers will never be seen again! The actual situation of studying is the same as ordinary primary schools, divided into six grades with a six-level compound teaching system. They learn Chinese, mathematics, and general knowledge. Foreign languages ​​are temporarily postponed. Some sixth-graders will enter middle school next semester.</p>
<p>The expenses of this First Home are currently no less than 600,000 per year. However, only a few staff members are running around to raise the money. This requires the assistance of all sectors of society. They also hope to raise more funds to accommodate more poor children.</p>
<p>Second Home</p>
<p>The Second Children's Home is located on the quiet Nanshi Theater Road. Its surroundings are desolate, with broken tiles and collapsed walls everywhere. The playground is very large, overgrown with weeds. Groups of three to five children in new uniforms are running happily, enjoying their annual Children's Day.</p>
<p>In a building near the playground, there is a reception room, teachers' dormitories, and a girls' dormitory. A very large room is sparsely furnished with only a few single iron beds. The bedding is neatly arranged. There is also a medical room here. A female doctor treats them for scabies, trachoma, dysentery, tooth diseases, and other ailments. Due to the temporary lack of equipment and the high cost of medicine, they are often helpless and unable to make the children completely healthy.</p>
<p>Broad beans are blooming with small purple flowers, releasing a faint fragrance. This is the children's own vegetable garden. They will soon be able to eat the fruits they have planted. In this vegetable garden, there is a brick-paved path. After walking along this long path, there is a row of houses, which are classrooms, boys' dormitories, dining hall, and kitchen. The kitchen is spacious, but very dilapidated. Inside, there are three or four large jars filled with pickled cabbage, and a lot of coal is piled up, which is their current fuel. Their diet is also very austere. They often eat vegetarian food, with meat only once a month. They have porridge twice a day, and rice once, accompanied by coarse grains. The dining hall consists of two large rooms, with long tables and long benches inside. It is quiet and empty. The desks and other items in the classrooms are a bit old, but still neat. They are repaired by the children themselves! Four or five children are gathered together, reviewing their lessons. The walls are covered with examples of calligraphy in large and small characters, and compositions. Upstairs is the boys' dormitory. The rooms are even more spacious, with only five or six people occupying a large room. However, there are no beds here; they sleep on straw mats laid on the floor with some bedding on top. Of course, this is much better than sleeping in an attic.</p>
<p>This house can accommodate another two or three hundred poor children. However, due to insufficient funding and the problem of food, it cannot expand its work. Here, I not only loudly appeal to people from all walks of life to donate money, medicine, books, school supplies, etc., to the home, but also hope that the authorities will increase the number of rations of rice, cloth, and coal briquettes for orphans and poor children. This is truly a matter of urgency!</p>
