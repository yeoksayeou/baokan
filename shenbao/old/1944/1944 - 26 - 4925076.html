<h3>星期評論　國共關係的重新估計　吉田東</h3>
<p>上海這個地方，往往把可能的事物，談作現實的事物。最近滿城風雨地散佈着英德媾和及蔣介石訪問延安的兩種傳說。按月前的世界形勢，這兩種傳說也仍只限於可能。使此可能變為現實，當然還需耍客觀條件。上海人在聽這類傳說之前，最好先研究一下，目前的世界形勢中，是否有讓樣的客觀條件。</p>
<p>最近國共摩擦的一個最大特微，就是蔣介石本人也被捲入這一鬭爭的漩渦裏了。過去任何的國共糜擦，無論怎樣激烈，無論怎樣尖銳，然而中共只是採取指桑駡槐的政策，卽抨擊何應欽，張羣，陳立夫等派的「反共三位一體」，而傍敲側擊蔣介石。自從蔣介石發表「中國之命運」一書後，他本身業已照然若揭地成為「反共三位一體」的思想指導人了，於是中共便直接而公開地攻擊蔣介石本人了。中共這一政治攻勢，顯然反映着東綫蘇軍的進展得手。蔣介石為緩和國內的這種形勢，而親身訪問延安，這完全是一種猜想。然而這種猜想，是忽略了下列客觀形勢。</p>
<p>蔣介石現在對於中國共產黨，仍然還不放鬆軍事上的封鎖政策。蔣介石處於目前的國際形勢之下，是不能明目張膽地討伐中共的。然而對於中共向封銷錢外伸張勢力，自然又不能視若無睹。英美也不希望蔣介石過於壓迫中共，造成國共間的大屠殺，以致削弱重慶的反日抗戰能力。然而只要不越出這一限度，蔣介石無論怎樣壓迫中共，英美自然是不會說話的。</p>
<p>蔣介石認為，假如協約國勝利，則一最後勝利」卽自己的功勞，全國人民都會擁護他個人的，所以利用這種人心所歸，而消滅中國共產黨，是一蹴而即的事。蔣介石還認為，假如在某種形勢下，能與日本妥協，則憑藉日本武力的援助，而消滅中國共產黨，也是易如反掌的事。所以蔣介石認為無淪走那一條道路，都對他無損，在最後時機未到之前，只要限制中共的發展，也就够了。這就是蔣介石封鎖邊區政策的眞正意圓，同時也是英美的希望。</p>
<p>假如目前蔣介石立刻發動反共戰爭，則會削弱重慶的抗日戰鬭力，同時也會削弱蘇聯的抗德戰鬭力。因為中共盤据延安，事實上是鎭守蘇聯遠東邊疆的。如蘇聯遠東邊疆不寗，蘇聯則不得不從德蘇戰錢上抽調兵力。所以英美在最後時機（卽蘇聯倒台，或德國倒台，最好兩敗俱傷）未到之前，也不願意重慶刺激蘇聯。</p>

<h3>國社黨秉政紀念日井口部長談話　確信德光榮勝利期不在遠</h3>
<p>東京二十九日央祉電二十九日為德國社黨秉政十三週紀念日。日情報局井口第二部長特招待德駐日記者發表談話，其大意謂：自一九三三年一月卅日希特勒元首秉政以來，於茲已十有一年，國社黨之偉業，為歷史上所罕見，其尤重要者為德國民族之團結一致，及德國於世界上獲得鞏固之地位。溯自一九三三年以來，德國之生產年年增加，瀕於破產之德國產業，於此獲救，更重行整理從分裂中救出德國民族，德國社黨執政十一年來，其進程非如英美以稱覇世界為目標者，係在於確保德國民族之生存。然德國之生存與企圖，將全世界置於其隸屬下之英美全權主義，　不相容。倫敦與紐約之戰爭挑撥從事活躍，因此德國乃不得不發動戰爭，德國為確保其生存而不得不奮然而戰者實與日本同，日德兩國之盟約根據亦在此。德國社黨完全成功之時，即粉碎英美全權主義之時。敵人近曾大事宣傳展開歐洲登陸戰，彼等開始登陸作戰之時，實為德國發揮戰力之際。確信德之光榮勝利，為期不遠矣。</p>
<h3>日明年度預算案　通過衆院移貴院　總額二百零一萬萬圓</h3>
<p>東京廿九日中央社電日衆院今晨十時舉行全體會議，討論昭和十九年度歲人歲出總預算案特別會計歲入歲出預算案，及預算關係各案，當經全體一致通過。政府原定二百零一億之明年度預算，於此即由衆院送交貴族院。貴院於下午一時卅分舉行全體會議，由賀屋藏相作財政演說，繼提出增稅法案及衆院案四件，幷說明政府提案理由後，即交委員審議。另一方面衆院於下午召開各特別委員會開始審議由貴院送交之各法案，由一時起舉行農林中央金庫委員會議，二時起舉行華北開發委員會議，因此兩院已打成一片，促進政府施策之實現，表明信賴協力之意向。决戰下之議會各項議程於此已劃一階段，今後之審議重點已移於貴院。</p>

<h3>與軸心絕交後　阿採取措置</h3>
<p>里斯本廿九日中央社電據阿根廷總統廿八日接見記者國，就阿根廷政府與軸心斷交之對策，宣稱，　關於與軸心各國斷交後即將施行之一部措置，尚未至說明之時。然因斷交之結果，對內政性格自應採一定之手段，在國際上亦須請求保護阿根廷國民權益之必要措置，余認為以上之對策　為重要。迄昨日止，在阿國之兩國為代表，即巳喪失代表之資格，然基於國際上之禮讓法則等，繼續受保護優待，阿根廷政府之代表亦受同樣之待遇，　阿根廷政府與日德兩國斷絕國交然不以此等兩國之國民為目標，故僑居阿國之日德兩國國民，須衷心諒解阿根廷政府寬大目的，阿根廷政府除作一般之警戒外，决不採任何措置。然對宣傳使節較平時將更加一層嚴重統制。　關於貿易，阿根廷政府正逐步實行與美洲各國緊密合作之企劃。</p>
<h3>阿在日德權益委托瑞典照</h3>

<h3>北路蘇軍攻勢益熾烈托斯諾德軍撤退</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十九日中央社電東綫北段之蘇軍攻勢近日益熾，其攻勢路綫大抵有五。　為自奧倫寗斑方面進攻位於愛沙尼亞國境之那爾瓦。　為切斷列寗格勒至盧加間之鐵路。　為自托斯諾撲向盧加。　為自諾伏哥洛特西向，以列寗格勒維特勃斯克鐵路間之巴迭加亞為目標，再進而取盧加。　為自斯達拉亞進擊杜那。現在以上各地均已演成激戰，其中以列寗格勒南方地區之蘇軍壓力為最大。據柏林二十八日消息，亦會謂德軍業由列密格勒莫斯科間鐵路間之托斯諾及列寗格勒那爾瓦間鐵路間之渥沙索沃撤退。托斯諾西面之柳班及該地區南之奇茂特沃至巴迭加亞東方之沿綫，現正展開拉鋸式之衝戰。傳稱柳班奇茂特沃兩地亦發生巷戰，其戰鬥地域又漸接近列寗格勒。至維特勃斯克之鐵路綫，又在伊爾諾湖四周作戰中。麥列克夫將軍所屬之蘇軍亦以巴迭加亞及杜那為目標，實行强進。據路透社莫斯科電，蘇軍之先鋒隊已抵斯達拉亞盧撒西北二十八哩之西姆斯克。</p>
<h3>孤注一擲　德蘇戰綫概觀</h3>
<p>開戰以來二年有半，其間經過許多激烈戰鬥的德蘇戰爭，今以西烏克蘭大平原為其主要戰塲，在中南部各地激戰中。霏霏下降的白雪，零下五六度到二十度的嚴寒，不斷地狂舞的大風雪，在這種大自然下，傾全力圖奪還天地的紅軍，與取柔軟戰術應付的德軍，兩軍交綏的情况，誠為歷史上空前的大陸攻防戰。德軍當局也已指出戰局的嚴重，而緊迫的西歐情勢，及隨着戰火西移而來的複雜的政治問題等，在軍事上，在政治上，其動湯凝集了新的視綫</p>
<h3>現戰綫一瞥</h3>
<p>現戰綫北起加萊里阿地峽，列寗格勒區域，至中部的納威里，維德伏斯克，從這裏成S形南下接連克里米亞半島的寇赤區域。這中間的主要戰塲是納威里西方，維德伏斯克的四周里奇赤西部（以上中部戰綫），舊波蘭的薩爾努伊附近，洛伏諾東部，倍爾奇齊夫南方南布格河上游地帶，基洛伏勒特西南，克里伏伊，洛格區域，寇赤區域等，其中從舊波蘭屬東南部至基洛伏格勒特西南約六百公里的一綫，最是戰鬥激烈的地方，去年十一月中旬，乘收復基輔的餘威，伐茲金軍大將所率領的第一烏克蘭戰綫軍，繼續西進，到達齊托米爾，科洛斯頓兩市，但孟許泰因元帥麾下的德軍，從南北夾攻這伸出的長楔，使之敗退。然而伐茲金軍編成具有完全的冬季裝備的有力部隊，自去臘二十四日起，由沿前次的西進路開始大規模的反攻。這大軍團有步騎兵〇個軍團，戰車〇師，砲兵〇師，在空眾掩護下，此次更擴其攻勢，以右翼向薩爾努伊方面。中央向洛伏諾方而，左翼向齊托米爾南部攻擊。</p>
<p>對此，德軍根據去夏以來的縮短戰綫戰術，一面避免兵力的徒然消耗，一而直衝紅軍的側面，繼續與以物的人的損害。因此，再從奪回的齊托米爾，科洛斯登兩市撤退，任紅軍進出於舊波蘭地境。各要地僅以少數部隊頑守，以應付來攻的紅軍部隊。</p>
<h3>鳥克蘭戰綫</h3>
<p>一面在基洛伏格勒特區域，紅軍第二烏克蘭戰綫軍（司令官科納夫軍大將），自一月五日起開始行動，指該市有直下西南之勢。於是烏克蘭戰綫遂見嚴重。即伐茲金軍以右翼鑽進德軍的隙縫，進迫波蘭國境，一面更令其主力從齊托米爾，倍爾奇齊夫攻克維尼赤，向貝薩拉比亞方面，與南下的科納夫軍連絡，擬大包圍特尼泊爾河大灣曲部內的德軍。現在正與在南布格上游地帶邀擊的德軍激戰中。至於暫呈膠着狀態的克里伏伊·洛格區域的紅軍第三烏克蘭戰綫軍（司令官瑪里諾夫斯基軍大將），駐屯於從海爾遜區域至特尼泊爾河口一帶的第四烏克蘭戰綫軍（司令霍特爾布興軍大將），現傳正在集結兵力中，所以戰火即將復燃。又蘇聯所垂涎的克里伏伊·洛格的鐵產地，尼科波里的錳產地，亦在覬覦中。</p>
<h3>波羅的克軍</h3>
<p>烏克蘭戰綫之外，紅軍從去年十二月中旬起以新編的波羅的克軍在納威里西部，維德夫斯克區域開始反攻，但被阻於德軍而暫吿停頓。這一支紅軍，從其所冠的名稱波羅的克看顧來，可見其企圖沿波羅的海國進出。又在克里米亞半島的寇赤區域，丁莫生柯麾下的紅軍，亦在伺機反攻，但嚴陣以待的德羅軍，不容其越雷池一步。</p>
<p>這樣，紅軍第三次冬季反攻的目標，可見其在利用地中海，西歐情勢的變遷，而欲南北截斷德軍的兵力，收復烏克蘭，及突入波羅的克一帶。但這一行動果能包圍從特尼泊爾河到特尼愛斯特爾河這廣大的西南鳥克蘭地方達〇〇萬的德軍嗎？</p>
<h3>德軍確保據點</h3>
<p>德軍在此方面並在後方確保六條鐵道綫，並保持着前綫的據點，在舊波蘭東部方面亦然。尤其在北部，在列寗格勒的西南，布有鞏固的陣地。德軍當局今後雖仍縮短戰綫，但在舊波蘭屬內的德蘇分割綫，有堅固的陣地，兵站綫縮短的結果，反使紅軍的補充綫延長。加以三月過後，因冰雪融解的關係，多濕地的西烏克蘭，化成一片泥海。反攻的紅軍亦深知這幾點，是以一定欲在冬季中傾全力以擴大戰果。指揮德中部軍的是名將克留格元帥，南部的孟許泰因元帥是前年攻略眾伏斯托波爾的將軍，其餘德軍部隊尚未顯露其攻擊力的眞面目，將在何時何地表現其力量，一般對之大為期待。對方紅軍的伐茲金將軍，亦身經百戰，是戰車作戰的權威，所屬部隊都其有强靱的戰意，而蘇聯的戰力，也還綽有餘力。（朝日新聞社歐美部·洩邊善一郎）（翔：譯自一月十五日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>柏林市再遭　恐怖空襲　本月中第五次</h3>
<p>柏林廿九日中央社電德國新聞社訊；英轟炸機大編隊於今日拂曉，對此間施行本月中第五次之恐怖空襲。敵機會於昨晚向住宅區肓目擲彈，其時黑雲蔽天，視綫極劣，晚間戰鬥機央勇迎擊，與敵方四引擎之軍轟炸機展開激烈之空戰，據目不所知，敵機被擊落四十架，但被擊毀之敵機尚不止此數。</p>
<h3>二十分鐘間投彈千餘噸</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電據倫敦來電，英空軍部昨日發表：英轟炸機隊會於二十七日空襲柏林，另一隊更轟炸歐陸，是役英機三十四架未飛返。又據路透社報稱，英軍轟炸機隊　二十分間，向柏林投下炸彈約一千五百噸。</p>
<h3>反軸心委定　西非總司令</h3>
<p>里期本二十九日中央社電據倫敦息：陸軍中將勃逸特諾斯華斯爵士，已被任為反軸心聯軍西總司令。</p>
<h3>以羅馬為目標　將發動總攻　反軸心軍不斷增援</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電據海通社訊，前綫來電稱：過去二十四小時中，義南戰綫無甚變化，德軍在卡西諾之北從事反攻，殊為得手。納吐諾海岸橋頭堡，敵續有生力軍登陸，不久難免展開大規模之戰爭，此役結果，始可决定，敵方登陸是否成功，德最高軍事當局正佈置陣地，以備大戰之來臨。</p>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電據德國通訊社訊：因反軸心軍有力部隊於納吐諾登陸，故義國復增一新戰綫。反軸心軍司令亞歷山大於各部地中海使用最大之運輸船團，陸續向該方面增援，料最近即可集結完畢。反軸心軍之作戰企圖，於直接攻擎羅馬前，首先遮斷羅馬與加里格利亞諾河戰綫之連絡，或於納吐諾橋頭堡北方，向羅馬東南方約十公里之阿爾巴尼山系進攻，料不出數日即將以該山系為中心，展開一大規模之激戰，該戰鬬終了後，反軸心各國當可知於德軍控制下之地域，實行登陸作戰，須作如何重大犠牲。敵軍為呼應展開納吐諾地區之總攻勢，似更以圖於加里格利亞諾南方卡西諾兩戰區及亞特里亞海沿岸亦展開攻勢，此不過僅為牽制納吐諾前方之德軍而已。</p>
<h3>法強化陸軍力　保障國境安全</h3>

<h3>評言　農業增產會議</h3>
<p>今年獻歲伊始，我們即以「一年之計」為題，主張在今年增產年中，首先努力於食糧之增產以及農業勞慟力的保持，誠以農業增產之在中國，實又為工業增產之先决問題，因為我國目前祗可以言輕工業之發展，而輕工業中，如紗布之紡織，麵粉之製造等等，其原料無一不仰給於農業方面的生產，固不待智者而後知；因此糧食，實業，建設三部，已定於二月九日在京舉行農業增產會議，其目的在於促進農業增產，並使各省市機關明瞭中央之全體增產計劃與實施辦法。無疑地，這一會議，對於今年增產年，必能有莫大的貢獻。</p>
<p>關於農業增產之技術問題，甚至與農業增產間接有關的農村復與問題，現在我們並不預備放在討論之列，我們所期望於農業會議者，惟有一點，就是不管用什麼方法來增產，我們對於今年的增產運動，必須抱着一個至低限度的目標，這個至低限度的目標，就是確保國內食糧之需給，有如日滿本年米糧年度之食糧需給情形一般。據日本食糧管理局長前日在東京衆院赤字公債委員會席上所報吿的，昭和十九年度（民國三十三年）日滿决不仰仗外米，除米麥外，並擬使馬苓薯及雜糧等成為主要食糧。我們但願農業增產會議能够以此為訓，因為這是戰時安定民生的惟一先决條件。</p>

<h3>星期評論（自第一版轉來）</h3>
<p>再者，中共很淸楚，重慶只要繼續抗戰，則不會發動大規模的武力勦共戰事。因此，中共在重慶未達最後時機前，盡量擴展地盤，以備萬一。以軍事準備　，中共現在的勢力，除陜西，甘肅兩省外，更普　於河北，山東，熱河，山西，察哈爾，河南，湖北，江西，浙江，江蘇，安徽，廣東等十二省內，各有中共軍的支隊駐紮著。例如浙江省的「三五支隊」，原來不過八十名中共幹部，由上海，經浦東，而轉赴餘姚地帶。從事組織民衆，現在竟達十五萬兵力之多。按思想準備　，最近毛澤東發表了「兩個主義」，以對抗蔣介石著的一中國之命運一，並要求中共黨員，注意不久將來的公開鬭爭。</p>
<p>總而言之，無論國共合作也好，國共摩擦也好，都有其一定的限度。摩擦尚未達到公開的武力討伐，合作尚未越出武該和平，這種國共關係的現狀，結果將繼續到最後時機。</p>
<p>在這種內外的形勢裏，國共關係無論如何激化和惡化，都牧不到蔣介石非冒險飛訪延安不可的根據。蔣介石訪問延安，這簡直等於國民黨對中共投降。指導國民黨內部的眞正人物，是代表民族資產階級和地主的所謂「反共三位一體」，蔣介石决不會冒險而反對他們的意見，造成國民黨內部的分裂。</p>
<p>於是我們最須注意者，就是為什麼會發生這類傳說呢？在現狀上，重慶反共勢力的加强，自然就是促使重慶接近日本的一個絕大因　。重慶如開始武力剿共，那就是證明重慶與日本間業已成立了妥協；然而在現狀上，英美與重慶問如沒有妥協，則日本與重慶問也不可能妥協；所以武力對共的開始，就是英美重慶也和日本開成立了妥協的開始。這種妥協，對於目前反復打擊德國的蘇聯，具有何種意議，當然無須費詞解釋的吧！反過來說，國共關係的好轉，就是證明重慶反對日本抗戰力的加强，蘇聯因而就可以安心從事於反德戰爭。而英美渝特別認為現在必須給蘇聯這樣一副安心劑。換言之，蘇聯的確對於最近的英美德妥協說，在患着神經過敏的病。自然，蘇聯木身是有不能不患神經過敏症的苦衷。本來英美約定在去年底開關第二戰綫，而一直到今天尚未發動，且英美軍在意大利戰綫上遲遲不前，歸根結底此次冬季攻勢，仍然還是痳聯獨力支撑强大的德國反攻。蘇聯剛推進波蘭國境綫，而英美立刻就想保證波蘭領土的戰前狀况。威雨　在大聲急呼和　言慄聽地向英美上　階級宣傳：一蘇聯西進，即是英美的危機。且蘇聯的兵站交通綫過於延長，而進攻愈益感覺困難。假如重慶乘此時機，向中國共產黨一發動戰事，則蘇聯不得不立刻顧反到遠東邊疆。且重慶進攻中國共產黨，前面已經講過，就是暗示日英美問的妥協，又是暗示英美德的妥協。蘇聯當然也會想到，那就是世界大戰轉向階級戰爭的證明。經常利用資木主義國家間的矛盾，而不斷擴展勢力的蘇聯，認為最可怕者，乃資本主義國家的反蘇聯合戰綫。蘇聯也知道，此次世界大戰定有一天會達到這個反蘇階段的。蘇聯的希望，只是盡量使這樣一個口期拖延下去，在這個期間內盡量嗾使資木主義國家間相互搏鬥，以削弱其實力，而對於本身的元氣和國力，則盡量為最後鬥爭而保存。英美也知道蘇聯正在為最後時機而養精蓄銳，所以盡可能讓蘇聯獨力與德國死拚，以削弱其實力。為達到此目的，英美則盡量減輕蘇聯的後顧之　，而使之安心與德國進行殊死戰。國共再度合作的風傳，就是產生於畫約國的這種希望上。然而國共關係的本質，雖然有這種風傳，但在最後决裂前，只不過是交戰者間有條件的停戰而巳。（大魯譯）</p>

<p>眞人是四年級五組，級任先生就是那緒方先生。在新學年的開始，緒方先生非常滿意的樣子說，「志望軍人學校的人數，像這樣地多，實在是一個很好的現象。同校長先生也商量過了，那麼將這一班，就起名呌「軍人班」。只是名稱呌軍人班，也沒有什麼意義。一定要突破難關，實現縣下最高的入學率。不然，一定希望你們作出一個九州第一的入學率纔行。不久，要成為日本第一的——說老實話，能否使二中成為日本第一的中學，這責任完全都在諸君的雙肩上！」</p>
<p>緒方先生的熱情，過於激烈，所以來尾的話中，夾雜著不少的方言。</p>
<p>在這種情況之下，二中的歷史上，永垂不朽的軍人班，終吿成立了。眞人·隆夫·小森。萬代·都參加在內，是不待言的。但是志望陸軍的最多，同別班合起來，一共有四十一名。數學·英語·物理·化學，都有擔任的敎師隨着，在敎室或敎師的家裏，實行猛烈地準備敎育，和嚴格的訓陳。　　「斷而行之，鬼神避之—對入學考試，也要有這種決心！」那時候，已經退職了的菊池少佐，也來這樣地激　着。</p>
<p>敎的敎師是很熱誠的，而學的學生也是很熱誠的。在每個學生的胸中，都深刻着，自己獲得入學的榮冠，同時就是發揚母校的名譽。像這熱烈的準備入學考試，恐怕在全國之中，也是很少有的。</p>
<p>從那個時候，眞人就同軍人班的學友們，時常訪問緒方先生的家庭。英語是最得意的功課。但是有疑問的地方，却很不客氣地質問着先生，先生對難懂的成語，也要使他十分明瞭地解釋着。</p>
<p>眞人自從出人於緒方先生的家庭後，被這毫無矜飾，像珠玉一般的先生的人格所感動了。他那種溫厚地，品格淸高地城下武士的家風，不由地使人肅然起敬。家中有老　的母親太太，六個小孩子的一個溫暖地和平地家處。最喜歡小孩兒的眞人，對於十三歲的先生的長子以下，以及今年剛兩歲的四男，都成了很好的小朋友。</p>
<p>先生好像是很喜歡飮酒。然而，每月一次一定要帶眞人們到精華堂去吃點心的。眞人在這時候，對緒方先生確感到西洋「恩師」的意義。（三）（七）（四）</p>

<h3>Sunday Commentary: Re-evaluating the Relationship Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party - Yoshida Higashi</h3>
<p>Shanghai is a place where people often discuss possible events as if they were already realities. Recently, two rumors have been circulating like wildfire: one about a reconciliation between Britain and Germany, and the other about Chiang Kai-shek visiting Yan'an. According to the world situation a month ago, both rumors were still limited to possibilities. To turn these possibilities into realities, objective conditions are naturally required. Before listening to such rumors, it is best for people in Shanghai to first examine whether there are such objective conditions in the current world situation.</p>
<p>One of the most significant characteristics of the recent friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is that Chiang Kai-shek himself has been drawn into the vortex of this struggle. In the past, no matter how intense or sharp the friction between the two parties was, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) always adopted a policy of "pointing at the mulberry tree while scolding the locust tree," that is, criticizing the "anti-communist trinity" of He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, and others, while indirectly attacking Chiang Kai-shek. Since Chiang Kai-shek published his book "China's Destiny," he has become the ideological guide of the "anti-communist trinity," and the CCP has directly and openly attacked Chiang Kai-shek himself. This political offensive by the CCP clearly reflects the successful progress of the Soviet army on the Eastern Front. It is purely speculation that Chiang Kai-shek would personally visit Yan'an to ease this domestic situation. However, this speculation ignores the following objective situations.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek still has not relaxed his military blockade policy against the Chinese Communist Party. Under the current international situation, Chiang Kai-shek cannot openly wage war against the CCP. However, he naturally cannot turn a blind eye to the CCP's expansion of its influence beyond the blockade line. Britain and the United States also do not want Chiang Kai-shek to overly suppress the CCP, causing a large-scale massacre between the two parties, which would weaken Chongqing's ability to resist Japan. However, as long as this limit is not exceeded, Britain and the United States will naturally not speak out, no matter how Chiang Kai-shek suppresses the CCP.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek believes that if the Allied forces win, then "a final victory" will be his own merit, and the people of the whole country will support him personally. Therefore, using this popular support to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party is something that can be achieved overnight. Chiang Kai-shek also believes that if, under certain circumstances, he can compromise with Japan, then with the assistance of Japanese military force, eliminating the Chinese Communist Party would also be an easy task. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek believes that no matter which path he takes, it will not harm him. Before the final opportunity arrives, it is enough to limit the development of the CCP. This is the true intention behind Chiang Kai-shek's blockade policy of the border regions, and it is also the hope of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>If Chiang Kai-shek immediately launches an anti-communist war, it will weaken Chongqing's anti-Japanese fighting force, and it will also weaken the Soviet Union's anti-German fighting force. Because the CCP is based in Yan'an, it is in fact guarding the Soviet Union's Far Eastern border. If the Soviet Union's Far Eastern border is not secure, the Soviet Union will have to withdraw troops from the German-Soviet front. Therefore, before the final opportunity (i.e., the collapse of the Soviet Union or the collapse of Germany, preferably both suffering heavy losses) arrives, Britain and the United States are also unwilling for Chongqing to provoke the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Chief Iguichi's Speech on the Anniversary of the National Socialist Party's Rule: Believes the Glorious Victory of Germany is Not Far Off</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency): The 29th is the 13th anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule in Germany. Chief Igaichi, Second Department of the Japanese Information Bureau, specially invited German correspondents stationed in Japan to give a speech. The gist of the speech was: Since the assumption of power by Führer Hitler on January 30, 1933, eleven years have passed, and the great achievements of the National Socialist Party are rare in history. The most important of these is the unity of the German nation and the consolidated position of Germany in the world. Since 1933, German production has increased year by year, and German industries on the verge of bankruptcy have been rescued. The German nation has been rescued from division and reorganized. The progress of the German National Socialist Party during its eleven years in power is not like that of Britain and the United States, which aims to dominate the world, but lies in ensuring the survival of the German nation. However, Germany's survival and attempt are incompatible with the totalitarianism of Britain and the United States, which attempts to place the whole world under its control. London and New York are actively engaged in war instigation, so Germany has no choice but to launch a war. Germany must fight bravely to ensure its survival, which is the same as Japan, and the basis of the alliance between Japan and Germany also lies here. The complete success of the German National Socialist Party is the time to smash Anglo-American totalitarianism. The enemy has recently launched a major propaganda campaign to launch a European landing operation. The time when they start the landing operation is the time for Germany to exert its combat power. I firmly believe that Germany's glorious victory is not far off.</p>
<h3>Japanese Next Fiscal Year Budget Passed by the House of Representatives and Transferred to the House of Peers; Total Amount is 20.1 Billion Yen</h3>

The House of Peers held a plenary session at 1:30 in the afternoon, where Finance Minister Kaya gave a financial speech, followed by the presentation of the increased tax bill and four bills from the House of Representatives. After explaining the reasons for the government's proposals, they were submitted to the committee for deliberation. On the other hand, the House of Representatives convened various special committees in the afternoon to begin deliberating on the various bills submitted by the House of Peers. From 1:00, the Agricultural and Forestry Central Treasury Committee meeting was held, and from 2:00, the North China Development Committee meeting was held. Therefore, the two houses have become one to promote the implementation of government policies, expressing the intention of trust and cooperation. The various agendas of the parliament under the decisive battle have now reached a unified stage, and the focus of future deliberations has shifted to the House of Peers.</p>
<h3>Japanese National Savings Increase</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency): The Director of the National Savings Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Finance explained the savings increase performance in the first half of the latter half of Showa 18 [1943] at the House of Peers Deficit Committee today.

<h3>Argentina Takes Measures After Severing Ties with the Axis</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency): According to the Argentine president, who met with reporters on the 28th, regarding the countermeasures taken by the Argentine government after severing ties with the Axis powers, he declared, "It is not yet time to explain some of the measures that will be implemented immediately after severing ties with the Axis countries. However, as a result of the severance of ties, certain measures should be taken internally in terms of domestic policies, and necessary measures should be taken internationally to protect the rights and interests of Argentine citizens. I believe that the above countermeasures are extremely important. As of yesterday, the representatives of the two countries in Argentina have lost their qualifications as representatives, but based on international courtesy and other principles, they continue to receive protection and preferential treatment, and the representatives of the Argentine government receive the same treatment. Although the Argentine government has severed diplomatic relations with Japan and Germany, it does not target the citizens of these two countries. Therefore, Japanese and German citizens residing in Argentina must sincerely understand the Argentine government's generous purpose. The Argentine government will not take any measures except for general vigilance. However, publicity envoys will be subject to more stringent controls than usual. Regarding trade, the Argentine government is gradually implementing plans for close cooperation with the countries of the Americas."</p>
<h3>Argentina Entrusts Sweden to Take Care of Its Interests in Japan and Germany</h3>

<h3>Policy Changes Course, Argentine Cabinet Members Resign</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency): The Argentine government has disregarded the opinions of some cabinet members and forcibly severed ties with the Axis powers. According to a Reuters dispatch from the Argentine capital, Minister of War Martinetz, Minister of Agriculture Mason, and Minister of Interior Suzarrés suddenly resigned on the evening of the 27th, and it is rumored that the current cabinet, chaired by Ramírez, will face a crisis.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency): According to a United Press dispatch from Montevideo, Argentine Ambassador to Brazil, General Talosho, reportedly resigned on the 28th.</p>
<h3>The United States Applies Economic Pressure on Spain; Gibraltar Defense Forces Conduct Large-Scale Exercises</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency): The British and American governments have recently frequently used diplomatic and rhetoric organs to impose various pressures on the Spanish government. According to a dispatch from Washington, the U.S. State Department yesterday ordered a ban on oil shipments to Spain.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency): Reuters reports from Algiers: Gibraltar held large-scale exercises the night before last, with coastal artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and searchlights all participating in the exercises.</p>
<h3>Fierce Soviet Offensive in the Northern Sector; German Troops Retreat from Tosno</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 29th (Central News Agency): The Soviet offensive in the northern sector of the Eastern Front has intensified in recent days, and there are roughly five lines of attack. One is from the Orenienbaum area, attacking Narva on the Estonian border. Another is to cut off the railway between Leningrad and Luga. One is from Tosno, heading towards Luga. Another is from Novgorot-Seversky, targeting Badiegaia on the railway between Leningrad and Vitebsk, and then advancing to take Luga. One is from Staraya to attack Dno. Fierce battles have broken out in all of the above locations, with the greatest pressure from the Soviet forces in the southern Leningrad area. According to a message from Berlin on the 28th, the German army retreated from Tosno on the railway between Leningrad and Moscow and from Vozhasovo on the railway between Leningrad and Narva. A tug-of-war is currently taking place along the line from Lyuban, west of Tosno, and from Chimotvo in the south of the area to the east of Badiegaia. It is said that street fighting has also broken out in Lyuban and Chimotvo, and the battle area is gradually approaching Leningrad. The railway line to Vitebsk is also under battle around Lake Irno. The Soviet army under General Merekov is also aiming at Badiegaia and Dno, carrying out a strong advance. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the vanguard of the Soviet army has reached Simsuk, 28 miles northwest of Staraya Russa.</p>
<h3>A Gamble to the Last Ditch: An Overview of the German-Soviet Front</h3>
<p>Two and a half years since the start of the war, the German-Soviet war, which has undergone many fierce battles, now takes the great plains of western Ukraine as its main battlefield, with fierce battles raging in various parts of the central and southern regions. Falling snow, severe cold from five or six degrees below zero to twenty degrees below zero, and constant blizzards: under this great nature, the Red Army is exerting all its strength to try to regain the world, and the German army is responding with flexible tactics. The situation in which the two armies are engaged is truly an unprecedented continental defense war in history. The German authorities have also pointed out the seriousness of the battle situation, and the urgent situation in Western Europe, as well as the complex political problems that come with the westward shift of the war, in military and political terms, its turbulence condenses new visions.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Current Battle Lines</h3>
<p>The current battle line stretches from the Galeria Isthmus in the north, through the Leningrad region, to Navel in the center, and Vidbusk. From here, it forms an S-shape southward, connecting to the Kerch region of the Crimean Peninsula. The main battlefields in between are west of Navel, around Vidbusk, west of Richitz (the above being the central battle line), near Sarnui in former Poland, east of Lovono, the upper reaches of the Southern Bug River south of Belchiziv, southwest of Kirovgrad, the Krivoy Rog region, and the Kerch region. Among these, the line from southeastern former Poland to southwest of Kirovgrad, a distance of approximately six hundred kilometers, is the most fiercely contested area. In mid-November of last year, taking advantage of the momentum of recapturing Kyiv, the First Ukrainian Front army, led by General Fatuzhin, continued westward, reaching the two cities of Zhitomir and Korosten. However, the German forces under the command of Field Marshal Manstein launched a pincer attack from the north and south on this extended wedge, causing it to retreat. Nevertheless, the Fatuzhin army, having formed a powerful unit with complete winter equipment, launched a large-scale counteroffensive on December 24th, following the previous westward route. This large army group, consisting of zero infantry and cavalry corps, zero tank divisions, and zero artillery divisions, under air cover, further expanded its offensive, with its right wing towards Sarnui, the center towards Lovono, and the left wing attacking south of Zhitomir.</p>
<p>In response, the German forces, based on the tactic of shortening the battle line since last summer, avoided unnecessary troop losses while directly attacking the flanks of the Red Army, continuing to inflict material and human damage. Therefore, they withdrew again from the recaptured cities of Zhitomir and Korosten, allowing the Red Army to enter and exit the territory of former Poland. Only a small number of troops stubbornly defended key locations to cope with the attacking Red Army units.</p>
<h3>The Ukrainian Front</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Kirovograd region, the Red Army's Second Ukrainian Front army (commander General Koniev) began operations on January 5th, posing a direct threat to the southwest of the city. As a result, the Ukrainian front became serious. Namely, the Fatuzhin army used its right wing to penetrate the gaps in the German forces, approaching the Polish border, while also ordering its main force to capture Vinnitsa from Zhitomir and Berdichev, heading towards Bessarabia to link up with the southward-moving Koniev army, planning to encircle the German forces within the large bend of the Dnieper River. Currently, they are engaged in fierce battles with the German forces who are ambushing them in the upper reaches of the Southern Bug. As for the Red Army's Third Ukrainian Front army (commander General Malinovsky) in the Krivoy Rog region, which is temporarily in a stalemate, and the Fourth Ukrainian Front army (commander General Hoth), stationed from the Kherson region to the mouth of the Dnieper River, it is reported that they are currently gathering forces, so the flames of war will soon reignite. In addition, the Soviet Union is also coveting the iron ore region of Krivoy Rog and the manganese ore region of Nikopol.</p>
<h3>The Baltic Army</h3>
<p>Outside the Ukrainian front, the Red Army, since mid-December of last year, launched a counteroffensive with the newly formed Baltic Army in the western Navel and Vidbusk regions, but was blocked by the German forces and temporarily came to a halt. This Red Army unit, judging from its name "Baltic," shows its intention to advance along the Baltic countries. Also, in the Kerch region of the Crimean Peninsula, the Red Army under Timoshenko is also waiting for an opportunity to counterattack, but the German army, on high alert, does not allow it to cross the line.</p>
<p>Thus, the goal of the Red Army's third winter counteroffensive can be seen as utilizing the changes in the Mediterranean and Western European situations to cut off the German forces in the north and south, recover Ukraine, and break into the Baltic region. But can this action encircle the 〇〇 million German troops from the Dnieper River to the Dniester River in this vast southwestern Ukrainian region?</p>
<h3>German Forces Secure Strongholds</h3>
<p>In this regard, the German forces are securing six railway lines in the rear and maintaining strongholds on the front lines, as well as in the eastern part of former Poland. Especially in the north, southwest of Leningrad, there are solid fortifications. Although the German authorities will continue to shorten the battle line, there are solid fortifications on the German-Soviet dividing line within former Poland. The result of shortening the supply lines has lengthened the Red Army's supply lines. In addition, after March, due to the melting of ice and snow, the humid western Ukraine will turn into a sea of mud. The counterattacking Red Army is well aware of these points, and is therefore determined to exert all its strength during the winter to expand its gains. The commander of the German Central Army is the famous Field Marshal Kluge. Field Marshal Manstein, commander of the Southern Army, is the general who conquered Sevastopol the year before. The true strength of the other German units has not yet been revealed, and there is great expectation as to when and where they will show their power. General Fatuzhin of the opposing Red Army is also a veteran of many battles and an authority on tank warfare. His troops all have a strong will to fight, and the Soviet Union still has ample reserves of strength.

<h3>Berlin Again Suffers a Terrifying Air Raid: The Fifth Time This Month</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: A large formation of British bombers launched the fifth terrifying air raid of the month on this city at dawn today. Enemy aircraft blindly dropped bombs on residential areas last night. At that time, black clouds obscured the sky and visibility was extremely poor. Night fighters bravely intercepted and engaged in fierce air combat with the enemy's four-engine bombers. According to eyewitnesses, forty enemy aircraft were shot down, but the number of enemy aircraft destroyed was more than that.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Tons of Bombs Dropped in Twenty Minutes</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from London, the British Air Force announced yesterday: British bomber squadrons raided Berlin on the 27th, and another squadron bombed the European continent. Thirty-four British aircraft did not return. Reuters also reported that British bomber squadrons dropped approximately 1,500 tons of bombs on Berlin in twenty minutes.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Forces Appoint Commander-in-Chief for West Africa</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to London news: Lieutenant General Sir Giffard LeQuesne Martel has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Allied Forces in West Africa.</p>
<h3>Launching a General Offensive Aimed at Rome: Anti-Axis Forces Continue to Reinforce</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Havas News Agency, dispatches from the front lines state: In the past twenty-four hours, there has been little change on the southern Italian front. German forces launched a counteroffensive north of Cassino, which was very successful. Enemy forces continue to land fresh troops at the Anzio beachhead. A large-scale war is unavoidable soon. The outcome of this battle will determine whether the enemy's landing is successful. The German High Command is deploying its forces in preparation for the coming battle.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: Due to the landing of powerful anti-Axis forces at Anzio, a new front has been established in Italy. Anti-Axis commander Alexander is using the largest convoy of transport ships in the Mediterranean to reinforce the area, and it is expected that they will be fully assembled soon. The Anti-Axis forces' operational intentions are to first cut off the connection between Rome and the Garigliano River front before directly attacking Rome, or to attack the Alban Hills, about ten kilometers southeast of Rome, north of the Anzio beachhead. It is expected that a large-scale fierce battle will unfold around these hills in the next few days. After the end of the battle, the Anti-Axis countries will know what significant sacrifices must be made to carry out landing operations in areas controlled by the German army. In order to coordinate the general offensive launched in the Anzio area, the enemy seems to be planning to launch offensives in the Cassino and Garigliano areas south and along the Adriatic Sea coast, but this is only to contain the German forces in front of Anzio.</p>

<h3>Anglo-American Attention to the Soviet-Polish Dispute</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the border dispute between the Soviet Union and Poland, the Soviet government has consistently insisted on resolving it independently, refusing the intervention of the United Kingdom and the United States. As a result, relations between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States have returned to the state before the Tehran Conference. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the Soviet Union has again demanded the reorganization of the Polish government-in-exile and the dismissal of cabinet members who filed a lawsuit regarding the Katyn Forest massacre. The United Kingdom and the United States are most concerned about the method of resolving the dispute.</p>

<h3>Preparations for the Exchange of Residence Permits in Districts 1 and 8: To Begin on February 1st</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Regarding the issue of recalling the Citizen Certificates and Identity Residence Permits of citizens in Districts 1 and 8 and exchanging them for Residence Permits, according to information obtained by reporters from relevant authorities, it has been largely decided that the procedures will likely begin on February 1st. This is one of the main planned initiatives of the Municipal Government after taking over the two concessions. In the future, the identity certificates of all residents in the city can be unified, and those who harbor evil intentions will have no place to hide. The city's public security can also be effectively maintained. As for the specific methods of exchanging permits, the details will be officially announced by the Municipal Government. It has also been learned from another source that the heads of various Baojia have received official orders to instruct citizens to prepare so as to avoid being rushed at the last minute. Furthermore, citizens must personally complete these procedures on the specified date to prevent fraudulent substitution.</p>
<h3>Citywide Implementation of Rationing Oil by Population in Early Next Month: Oil to be Distributed Once a Month with Oil Purchase Certificates</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The threat to the city's cooking oil supply has not been eliminated, and it has become particularly severe since the suspension of the household oil ration. The needs of citizens are urgent, and black market prices are active. After thorough discussions among the Municipal Food Bureau, the responsible authorities of Districts 1 and 8, and the Oil and Food Committee, it has been decided to adopt a system of rationing oil by population. It is expected that this will be universally implemented throughout the city in early next month. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Curbing Price Hikes</p>
<p>Cooking oil is one of the main staple foods of citizens. Although the authorities have worked hard to maintain it in the past, public demand is high. The serious panic over cooking oil has not been resolved, and the allocation of household oil has been suspended. Citizens rely on the black market for cooking oil. Around the Spring Festival, black market oil prices have fluctuated repeatedly, directly and indirectly threatening people's livelihoods. In order to curb price hikes and reduce the black market, the Municipal Food Bureau, the responsible authorities of Districts 1 and 8, and the Oil and Food Committee have repeatedly discussed and decided to implement a system of rationing oil by population throughout the city.</p>
<p>Four Ounces per Person</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the citywide system of rationing oil by population, oil coupons will be issued, similar to the allocation of grain and sugar. Each person will receive one coupon, and citizens can purchase oil with this coupon. It is tentatively scheduled to be done once a month. The amount of oil allocated per person, regardless of age, is four ounces. If practically possible, efforts will be made to increase the allocation to half a catty per person. The designated retail stores for oil allocation will be the oil shops owned by the Oil and Food Committee.</p>
<p>Universal Implementation</p>
<p>The issuance of oil coupons for rationing oil by population will be the responsibility of the responsible authorities in Districts 1 and 8. The Municipal Food Bureau will supervise the various districts within the blockade line. Various procedures are actively underway. The Director of the Municipal Food Bureau, Ji Hua, has instructed the head of the bureau, Yang Wen, to make preparations quickly. After receiving the order, Yang is maintaining close contact with all relevant parties and it is expected that the implementation can be seen in early next month. At that time, the serious threat to cooking oil in the city can be universally resolved.</p>
<h3>The Great East Asia Struggle Film Exhibition: Today is the Last Day</h3>

<h3>China Shipping Vice President Mr. Yamamoto Passes Away</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Mr. Takeo Yamamoto, Vice President of China Shipping Company, suddenly died of a heart attack at 8 p.m. on the 28th of this month. Mr. Yamamoto was born in Asahikawa, Japan in the 19th year of Meiji. He was a classmate of Mr. Shigekichi Watanabe, former Vice President of China Shipping Company, and studied at the Hall of Japanese Commerce. He graduated in the 43rd year of Meiji with excellent grades. In the 2nd year of Taisho, he joined Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line). At the age of 37, he was appointed as the head of the Dalian branch and served as the head of branches in San Francisco and Hong Kong, actively participating in the global shipping industry. In the 8th year of Showa, he became the head of the Shanghai branch. During this period, he also served as a member of the former Shanghai Municipal Council. In the 13th year of Showa, he became the head of the Osaka branch. After only one year, he was appointed as the Director of Toa Kaiun Kisen (East Asia Shipping) due to the needs of the times. He made significant contributions to the expansion of wartime transportation. On November 28th of the 31st year of Showa, he succeeded Mr. Shigekichi Watanabe as the Deputy Chairman of China Shipping Company.

<h3>Ancient and Modern Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition: Jointly Organized by the Continental News and this Newspaper</h3>
<p>Painting and calligraphy are a kind of cultural art, which has a long history and a high status in our Eastern countries. The Continental News and Shen Bao are jointly organizing the "Ancient and Modern Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition" to introduce Chinese painting and calligraphy art and promote our inherent culture. It will be held from February 2nd to 6th at the China Painting Academy on Jing'an Temple Road. Approximately 300 pieces of famous paintings and calligraphy from the Ming and Qing dynasties and modern times will be collected and displayed in categories. There will also be special rooms for the paintings and calligraphy of Lord Shen Zipei (Zengzhi), as well as special rooms for the paintings and calligraphy of Wu Changshuo and Wang Yiting. Lord Shen Zipei was a great Confucian scholar in the late Qing Dynasty with vast knowledge and a unique calligraphy style. It is especially rare to have all of his works. After various searches, they have been made into a special room. Wu Changshuo and Wang Yiting are famous modern artists. With the support of their descendants, Wu Dongshu and Wang Jimei, all of their collected posthumous works will be specially displayed. These are all rare. Two-thirds of the exhibited paintings and calligraphy are not for sale. Only one-third will be sold by consignors. Preparations are actively underway. The exhibition will open on February 2nd. All are welcome to visit from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily.</p>
<h3>Rickshaws Unauthorized to Increase Prices: Police Bureau to Strictly Crack Down</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Regarding the recent increase in prices for rickshaws in this city, a reporter recently interviewed a senior official in charge of traffic affairs at the First Police Bureau. According to the official, the sudden increase in rickshaw prices has not been approved by the municipal authorities and is therefore illegal. Strict crackdown and punishment should be given. The chairman of the rickshaw trade association, Fu Xiangxun, has been summoned to the bureau and informed that he should immediately inform all rickshaw companies that they must not increase prices without the approval of the municipal authorities. Otherwise, they will be severely punished. Regarding rickshaw pullers extorting tips for alcohol and soliciting business along the way, the police authorities believe that simple fines are not effective in curbing these behaviors. Stricter measures will be taken. For the first offense, the driver's license of the rickshaw puller will be revoked. For repeated offenses, the vehicle license will be revoked. These measures will be implemented as soon as they are submitted for approval. It is hoped that citizens will cooperate with the authorities to ensure a thorough solution.</p>
<p>Economic News</p>
<h3>Commentary: Agricultural Production Increase Conference</h3>
<p>At the very beginning of this year, with the theme of "The Plan for the Year Lies in Spring," we advocated that in this year of increased production, the first effort should be focused on increasing food production and maintaining the agricultural labor force. This is because, in China, increasing agricultural production is indeed a prerequisite for increasing industrial production. Given that our country can currently only talk about the development of light industry, and within light industry, raw materials for things like the weaving of yarn and cloth, and the manufacturing of flour, are all dependent on agricultural production. This is obvious without needing a wise person to point it out. Therefore, the Ministries of Food, Industry, and Construction have scheduled an agricultural production increase conference to be held in Beijing on February 9th. The goal is to promote increased agricultural production and to ensure that the various provincial and municipal authorities understand the central government's overall production increase plan and its implementation methods. Undoubtedly, this conference will make a significant contribution to this year of increased production.</p>
<p>Regarding the technical issues of agricultural production increase, and even the rural revitalization issues that are indirectly related to agricultural production increase, we are not prepared to put them on the discussion list now. What we expect from the agricultural conference is only one thing: no matter what methods are used to increase production, we must have a minimum target for this year's production increase campaign. This minimum target is to ensure the domestic food supply, just like the food supply situation for Japan and Manchuria this year. According to the report given by the Director of the Japanese Food Administration to the House of Representatives Deficit Public Bond Committee in Tokyo the other day, in Showa 19 (Republic of China Year 33), Japan and Manchuria will definitely not rely on foreign rice. In addition to rice and wheat, they also plan to make potatoes and miscellaneous grains major food sources. We only hope that the agricultural production increase conference can take this as a lesson, because this is the only prerequisite for stabilizing people's livelihoods during wartime.</p>
<h3>Spring Holiday Ends: Banking and Finance Sector Resumes Business Yesterday; Hundreds of More Exchange Houses Participate in Remittances</h3>

<p>Moving, Lost Items</p>
<p>Moving Out Report Procedures: Those moving out should send the household registration certificate issued by the former West Shanghai Police Bureau to the Baojia Section of the police substation in charge, and obtain a "Household Registration Movement Report Form." Fill it out according to the instructions, and have it certified by the Jia head, Bao head, and Lianbao head (when the Lianbao head certifies, each person registering should be on the register). Then, send it to the Baojia Section, and submit the previously issued residence permit, as well as a fee of five yuan. The Baojia Section will then cancel the registration in the record book, and issue a receipt, as well as the Household Registration Movement Certificate, which is the lower part of the Household Registration Movement Application Form. This certificate is used to move, and to report the move to the new district. (Note 1) The procedures for moving elsewhere are the same as those for moving out, but only the household registration of those moving elsewhere needs to be canceled on the household registration certificate, and the household registration certificate does not need to be submitted. Lost Citizen Certificate Report Procedures: Those reporting should have the Jia head, Bao head, and Lianbao head provide a letter of certification, and apply to the Baojia Section for re-issuance, and pay a handling fee of ten yuan. After the Baojia Section verifies the information, they can pick up the re-issued Citizen Certificate in three days upon presentation of the handling fee receipt. When necessary, citizens may be required to submit a newspaper containing an advertisement declaring the loss. (Note) All forms, certificates, receipts, and other printed materials are issued by the Baojia Department to ensure uniformity. The fees collected and all report forms are also handled in the same way as other substations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Special Municipality First District Public Notice</h3>

<h3>Post-Spring Festival Stock Market Opens High, but Soon Weakens; Large Number of New Stocks Listed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock exchange resumed trading as usual after the Spring Festival holiday. It was a Saturday, so trading was only open for half a day in the morning. Hopes for a bull market were seen, but turned into disappointment. A selling trend prevailed, and stocks in various sectors declined. The main reason is that credit has not eased, and lending by banks and money shops is still under serious consideration. In addition, sixteen new stocks have been approved for listing, which is diluting purchasing power. Some investors are also selling old stocks to raise cash. Confidence in the market is faltering. Among textile stocks, Wing On Textile Factory saw the largest drop compared to the pre-holiday price (January 20th), falling 17.5 yuan. China Textile, Sin Hwa, and Rong Feng each fell 6 to 8 yuan. Yuen Yuen and Chen Fung each rose by 1 yuan. In addition, new stocks such as Chen Tan Silk Weaving, Fook Cheong Dyeing and Weaving, and Foo Min Weaving were listed and began trading. In the department store sector, Wing On and two other companies each fell 5 to 7.5 yuan, but Kwong Hwa Department Store rose. Shanghai Department Store rose to 24 yuan. In the culture sector, Chung Hwa Bookstore and China Film both saw declines. Pu Fung Paper, ex-dividend, opened at a high price of 16.5 yuan, but was difficult to buy. Among new pharmaceutical stocks, French Pharmacy entered the 70 yuan range. In the chemical sector, five new stocks were traded: Calcium Milk Powder, China Timber Dryer, New Asia Hygiene, Tak Sing Chemical, and Zhen Chung Chemical. Great China Match dropped slightly by 30 yuan. In the public utility sector, North Water and China Electric were flat. Kung Sing Electric rose by 1.5 yuan. In the real estate sector, Hing Yan and Heng Hing opened, each rising by more than 3 yuan from face value. Wing Hing and Lien Hwa were all slightly lower. Other stocks such as Hong Yuan Confectionery retreated. Sun Lok and Tai Sun Wah Industries rose slightly. Kiu On entered the 40 yuan range. Sing Tai Enterprise debuted and rose to 14.5 yuan on buying. The closing prices at noon are listed below: Stock Name Noon Close Wing On Textile Factory 215.00 Ta Tung Silk Factory 59.50 China Textile Factory 88.00 Sin Hwa Textile Factory 92.00 Rong Feng Textile 84.00 Yuen Yuen Printing and Dyeing 39.00 Lun Wah Dyeing and Weaving 66.50 Tung Chai Printing and Dyeing 27.75 Chen Hing Cotton Weaving 48.00 King Lun Shirt and Socks 27.50 King Fook Shirt and Socks 38.00 China Silk Industry 472.50 Mei Ya Silk Fabrics 193.00 Chen Tan Silk Weaving 55.00 Wing On Company 232.50 Kwong Hwa Department Store 27.25 New Shanghai Company 152.00 New Hwa Company 26.00 National Goods Company 1154.00 Chung Hwa Film 82.00 Chung Hwa Bookstore 610.00 World Bookstore 139.00 Chun Fung Paper 16.00 French Pharmacy 68.00 New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory 34.25 Great China Matches 730.00 Calcium Milk Powder 15.25 New Asia Hygiene 20.00 Nanyang Tobacco 740.00 Hong Yuan Confectionery 101.00 Kung Sing Electric 20.00 Wing Hing Real Estate 36.25 Tin Fung Real Estate 20.00 Lien Hwa Real Estate 33.25 Sun Lok Industry 24.50 Kiu On Industry 38.50 Lee Asia Industry 56.00 Great China Industry 20.25 New Asia Construction 26.75 New Chung Industry 25.00 Kam Hing Chen Industry 17.50 In other news, Shanghai Department Store, with capital of 30 million yuan and assets estimated to be several times higher, listed its shares yesterday at 10 yuan per share.

<h3>Today's Charity Soccer Match Rescheduled for the 6th</h3>
<p>The Spring Festival Charity Soccer Match, organized by the Shanghai Football Association, was originally scheduled for two games. It has now been decided to change it to one game, with the China Team playing against the Western Union Team. It was originally scheduled to be held at 10:30 AM today at the Yiyuan Stadium, and the Minister of Social Affairs was invited to personally kick off the game to show the importance. However, yesterday, the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Football Association, Zhou Jiaju, announced that due to continuous rain and water accumulation on the field, the match could not be held. Therefore, the charity match has been postponed to next Sunday (February 6th) morning, and will still be held at the original location. All pre-purchased tickets will be valid at that time, and advance sales will continue at the following three locations: Hua Dong Sports Goods Company on Jingan Temple Road, Yiyuan Stadium, and City Sports Association at 306 Jingan Temple Building. The Shanghai Football League matches, which were originally scheduled for one Group B game and five Group C games today, have also been postponed by the league authorities.</p>
<h3>Morning Friends Cup Basketball: Ren Yu vs. Morning Friends</h3>
<p>Five Morning Friends Cup basketball matches will be held at the Central Youth Gymnasium today, starting at 2:00 PM. Among the four Group B matches, the match between Great China and Team V is related to the championship. If Team V wins, it will create a three-way tie between Great China, Team V, and Green Swallow. Therefore, there will be an extremely intense and exciting performance. The final Group A match is between Ren Yu and Morning Friends. The former has three top players, Yu Yuzi, Zhuo Rong, and Ma Xi, so it shouldn't be difficult to defeat Morning Friends. The schedule for the five matches is as follows: Tong Yik - Long Hwa (Morning Friends B) 2:00 PM, Overseas Chinese - Morning Light (Friends B) 2:45 PM, Great China - Team V (Friends B) 3:30 PM, Up Together - Most Beneficial (Friends B) 4:30 PM, Ren Yu - Morning Friends (Group A) 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Western Youth Basketball Results</p>
<p>The four Western Youth basketball matches on the evening of the 28th had many forfeits due to a lack of reporting. Only one Group A match was played. In the match between Hua Nan and Giant, Hua Nan was down 9-21 at halftime. In the end, Giant defeated Hua Nan 46-21.</p>

<h3>Weekly Commentary (Continued from Page 1)</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the CCP is very clear that as long as Chongqing continues to resist Japan, it will not launch a large-scale military campaign to suppress the communists. Therefore, before Chongqing reaches the final moment, the CCP will try to expand its territory as much as possible to prepare for any eventuality. In terms of military preparations, the CCP's current power, in addition to Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, is also widespread in Hebei, Shandong, Jehol, Shanxi, Chahar, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong and other twelve provinces, where detachments of the CCP army are stationed. For example, the "Third and Fifth Detachment" of Zhejiang Province originally consisted of only 80 CCP cadres, who traveled from Shanghai, via Pudong, to the Yuyao area. They engaged in organizing the masses, and now have a military force of as many as 150,000. In terms of ideological preparations, Mao Zedong recently published "Two -isms" to counter Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny," and demanded that CCP members pay attention to the open struggles that will occur in the near future.</p>
<p>In short, whether there is cooperation or friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, there are certain limits. The friction has not yet reached open military suppression, and the cooperation has not yet exceeded the scope of peaceful coexistence. This status quo of KMT-CCP relations will continue until the final moment.</p>
<p>In this internal and external situation, no matter how intensified and deteriorated the KMT-CCP relations are, there is no basis for Chiang Kai-shek to risk flying to Yan'an. Chiang Kai-shek's visit to Yan'an is simply equivalent to the Kuomintang surrendering to the Communist Party. The real figures who guide the Kuomintang internally are the so-called "anti-communist trinity" that represents the national bourgeoisie and landlords. Chiang Kai-shek will never risk opposing their opinions and causing a split within the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>Therefore, what we must pay the most attention to is why these kinds of rumors arise? Under the current situation, the strengthening of anti-communist forces in Chongqing is naturally a major factor that promotes Chongqing's approach to Japan. If Chongqing starts a military campaign to suppress the communists, it would prove that a compromise has already been reached between Chongqing and Japan. However, under the current situation, if there is no compromise between Britain and the United States and Chongqing, then a compromise between Japan and Chongqing is also impossible. Therefore, the beginning of military action against the communists is also the beginning of a compromise between Britain and the United States and Chongqing with Japan. What kind of meaning this compromise has for the Soviet Union, which is currently repeatedly striking Germany, is of course unnecessary to explain! Conversely, the improvement of KMT-CCP relations would prove the strengthening of Chongqing's anti-Japanese resistance forces, and the Soviet Union could then safely engage in the anti-German war. Britain and the United States, in particular, believe that they must give the Soviet Union such a calming agent now. In other words, the Soviet Union is indeed suffering from nervous sensitivity about the recent rumors of a British-American-German compromise. Naturally, the Soviet Union itself has its own difficulties that make it unable to avoid suffering from nervous sensitivity. Originally, Britain and the United States had agreed to open the second front at the end of last year, but it has not yet been launched today. And the British and American troops have been slow to advance on the Italian front. In the final analysis, this winter offensive is still being supported solely by the Soviet Union against the powerful German counterattack. The Soviet Union had just advanced to the Polish border, and Britain and the United States immediately wanted to guarantee the pre-war status of Polish territory. William Averell Harriman loudly and cautiously proclaimed to the British and American upper classes: "The Soviet Union's westward advance is a crisis for Britain and the United States." Moreover, the Soviet Union's supply lines are too long, and the offensive is becoming more and more difficult. If Chongqing takes this opportunity to launch a war against the Chinese Communist Party, the Soviet Union would have to immediately turn its attention back to the Far Eastern frontier. And Chongqing's attack on the Chinese Communist Party, as mentioned earlier, implies a compromise between Japan, Britain, and the United States, and it also implies a compromise between Britain, the United States, and Germany. The Soviet Union would naturally also think that this is proof that the world war is turning into a class war. The Soviet Union, which constantly expands its power by taking advantage of the contradictions between capitalist countries, believes that the most terrifying thing is the anti-Soviet united front of capitalist countries. The Soviet Union also knows that this world war will one day reach this anti-Soviet stage. The Soviet Union's hope is only to delay such a day as much as possible, to incite capitalist countries to fight each other as much as possible during this period to weaken their strength, while preserving its own vitality and national strength for the final struggle. Britain and the United States also know that the Soviet Union is building its strength for the final moment, so they are trying their best to let the Soviet Union fight to the death with Germany alone in order to weaken its strength. To achieve this goal, Britain and the United States are trying their best to reduce the Soviet Union's worries about its rear, and allow it to safely engage in a life-and-death battle with Germany. The rumors of renewed KMT-CCP cooperation arise from this hope of the Allied countries. However, the essence of KMT-CCP relations, despite these rumors, is only a conditional truce between belligerents before the final rupture. (Translated by Da Lu)</p>

<h3>Navy Military Class (4)</h3>
<p>—Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>That year also passed as usual, and soon the third semester was published. The body of Makoto, who had been weakened by typhoid fever, had completely recovered to its original state, and so he devoted all his energy to his studies. Therefore, his grades were also remarkable, and he went one step further.</p>
<p>17-year-old fourth-year students – he and his classmates all became nervous. Those with good grades could go to higher-level schools after four years of graduation. Everyone was talking about their future problems. When Makoto expressed his desire for the Navy, the number of classmates who hoped to enter the Army and Navy schools was truly surprisingly large. It is said that this is a phenomenon unprecedented in the history of the Second Middle School.</p>
<p>Makoto was in the fifth group of the fourth grade. The class teacher was Mr. Ogata. At the beginning of the new school year, Mr. Ogata said very satisfied, "The number of people who aspire to military schools is so large, it is really a good phenomenon. I have also discussed it with the principal, so let's name this class the "Military Class." It is meaningless to just call it the Military Class. We must overcome difficulties and achieve the highest enrollment rate in the county. Otherwise, I definitely hope that you can achieve the highest enrollment rate in Kyushu. Soon, we will become the number one middle school in Japan – to be honest, the responsibility for whether the Second Middle School can become the number one middle school in Japan rests entirely on your shoulders!"</p>
<p>Mr. Ogata's enthusiasm was too intense, so his later words were mixed with a lot of dialect.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, the Military Class, which will be immortalized in the history of the Second Middle School, was finally established. Makoto, Takao, Komori, Bandai, and all participated in it, needless to say. However, most people aspired to the Army. Together with other classes, there were a total of 41 people. Mathematics, English, physics, and chemistry all had teachers in charge, and fierce preparation education and strict training were carried out in the classroom or at the teachers' homes. "Decide and act, and even ghosts and gods will avoid you – you must have this kind of determination for the entrance exam!" At that time, Major Kikuchi, who had already retired, also came to encourage them in this way.</p>
<p>The teachers who taught were very enthusiastic, and the students who learned were also very enthusiastic. In the hearts of every student, it was deeply engraved that their winning the crown of admission was also promoting the reputation of their alma mater. Such enthusiastic preparation for the entrance exam is probably rare in the whole country.</p>
<p>From that time on, Makoto and his classmates in the Military Class often visited Mr. Ogata's home. English was his best subject. But he asked the teacher very impolitely about any questions he had, and the teacher had to explain the difficult idioms to him very clearly.</p>
<p>Since Makoto entered Mr. Ogata's home, he was moved by the unpretentious, jewel-like personality of the teacher. His gentle, noble samurai family style couldn't help but make people feel awe. There was a warm and peaceful home with an elderly mother, a wife, and six children. Makoto, who liked children the most, became good friends with the teacher's 13-year-old eldest son and the fourth son, who was just two years old this year.</p>
<p>The teacher seemed to like drinking very much. However, he would definitely take Makoto and the others to Seika-do for refreshments once a month. At this time, Makoto truly felt the meaning of the Western "mentor" for Mr. Ogata. (3)(7)(4)</p>
