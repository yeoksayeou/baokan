<h3>醫學大會開幕</h3>
<p>第三屆東亞醫學大會，今日在京舉行大會揭慕儀式，二十六日起在上海舉行特別演講。此次出席代表約一百餘人，集合大東亞圈內醫界英俊於一堂，為大東亞全體民族商討增進健康方法，而為大東亞戰爭努力，對於今後東亞醫學前送，必有鉅大之貢獻。中國是本屆大會的地主，中國人民自更特別表示歡迎。同時我們以中國人民的立塲，希望代表諸先坐特別指敎的有二點。</p>
<p>如何推進中國醫學教育民族的健康，一方面在乎鍛煉，鍛煉的方法在於提倡體育。一方面在乎疾病之預防和治療，防病治病是醫師的資任，而造就醫師的機關，便是醫學敎育。中國新式醫學敎育歷史極短，而經事變之後，醫院和醫學校不幸停頓的更為數不少。所以過去不過感覺醫師的不足，現在則是實實在在的缺乏。本年一月三十一日日本衆院提議多設醫學校，多招醫學生，我們更主張科用敵產醫院之交還我國管理的，立即設立醫學院，取獨立學院性質，不要龐大組織，使成為敎育塲所，亦是實習塲所。（見二月五日社評）醫學院的設備自然不是一個醫院已足，醫學基本課程更在在與生物理化相關，不過就一個現有的機關，進而請求各方協助，添加各種設備，必較輕易。同時我們更主張盟邦日本移校中國辦法，不但在醫學敎育方面，卽共他方面都可效法，而醫學敎育關係民族健康，更為緊要。此次醫學大會代表諸先生俱為醫學界泰斗，俱為從事醫學敎育之先進，對於中國醫學敎育推進問題，更盼十二分的協力贊助。</p>
<p>如何發展中國公共衛生根據過去歷史，戰爭時期人口减少，死亡率增加，此為必然之理。而死亡率之最高者每非由於直接戰爭所致，而由於間接的受戰爭影響之疾病。疾病死亡率中最多者又每為由傳染而致死。所謂「大兵之後，必有疫癘」，所以疫　是民族致命之根，近年來虎列拉，腦膜炎等之流行病盛行，有時竟至一發不可收拾。國以民為本，國民數量的减少，損傷國力最鉅。如何預防，如何治撩，如何隔離，均須立即規定方案，立卽施行。戰亂之後，中國國內公共衛生硏究設備，實騐設備，專門人才，應甩材料，處處不足，更需各友邦加以密切的協助，以促共成功。</p>
<p>中國諺云，「不為良相，即為良醫」，良相與良醫戰位不同，而救民則一。以相與醫相提，可以表示中國重視良醫的傳統心理。現在集合大東亞「良醫」於一堂，必能救大東亞之人民，中國人民更願馨香以祝。</p>
<h3>日軍對伊姆法爾準備展開大攻勢　哥西馬西方高地已經攻陷</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫二十四日中央社電　緬印作戰開始以來，轉瞬巳數過，迫近伊姆法爾平原之日軍各部隊，現正整頓形勢，而準備對伊姆法爾展開一大攻勢。伊姆法爾南部之日軍，刻正壓縮包團敵方輪型防禦陳之鐵環，蝟集於長六十公里，寬四十委里地區中之敵兵，雖時作猛烈之反擊，而日軍則隨時將之擊潰，俟戰機降臨，一舉使之潰滅。敵第四軍所屬之第二十三師團第一。第四十九，第三十七各旅團，第二十師。第二十三師。第八十。第百師等各旅團，第十七師團殘存部隊，第四十八。第二十四。第六十三各旅團之一部及由空中補給之敵增援部隊四千與機甲旅團等大兵數萬，為挽回頹勢，終更極力往奔，力圖迥避日軍於羅克達庫湖濕地帶之　滅攻擊。伊姆法爾室內各道路要衝，築有見特雷式堡壘及所築之防塞數重，該市街前之陣地後部充滿預備部隊之營舍，自南部迪先　巴爾方面進攻之日軍部隊之正面，二十三日敵第二十三師團之一旅團等數千，於特庫諾巴爾後方陣地於空中掩護下積極準備作戰，其所構築陣式，幾全係阿拉坎戰棧之輪型防禦陣，以便後方之空中輸送，然無論陣地如何堅固，皆不堪日軍之一攻也。</p>
<p>仰光二十四日中央社電　哥西馬西方高地之五百頑敵，因日印同盟軍之猛攻，至二十一日拂曉已吿全面崩潰，並於密林放火，擬乘混亂之機逃脫日印軍之包圍，然日印軍部隊不顧一切，趕追敗敵，是日正午已將該高地完全佔領，刻正到處追殺敗敵，展開一大殲滅戰。如斯自九日來以，不分畫夜激戰十日間，堅固之敵軍陳地亦行陷落，哥希馬周圍之殲滅殘敵戰，於茲已告一段落。按該高地乃哥希黑周邊之敵軍唯一陣地，敵方雖失陷該高地，然仍否認日印同盟軍之完全攻略哥希馬，以防止國內民心之動搖。</p>
<h3>緬印中南部國境日軍攻勢益強化　馬猶山脈敵軍陸續撤退</h3>
<p>仰光二十四日中央社電　南部印緬國境方面日軍之攻勢，與伊姆法爾攻奪戰相呼應，刻正着着展開，尤其自加拉頓河谷要衝巴雷特瓦於二十日下午陷落後，日軍對印度之進攻作戰，更突然强化。綠南部印緬國境方面之敵軍，本年春初即將英印軍第七，第五兩師團配備於馬猶山脈，以作為奪回緬甸之先陣，但日軍二月四日以來，轉取攻勢，將英印第七師團主力殲滅，且將英印軍第五師團第二十六師牽制於馬猶山內，隨時隨地予以殲滅打擊。入三見後，更進擊目加拉頓河谷南下來援之西非軍第八十一師，繼則在中部印緬國境方面展開進攻印度之攻勢，於是迭次喪失主動權之敵軍，倉惶失措，三月上句僅能使降洛傘挺身隊降落於北續一帶作遊擊戰，但此等搪塞手段，於事無補，刻下伊姆法爾平原已化為日軍對印度從事進攻作戰之大橋明堡。加拉頓河谷之要塞巴雷特瓦亦入日軍掌握，不僅當初恃為反攻緬甸據點之馬猶山脈後方受日軍威脅，即阿拉坎方面英印軍第二十六師及殘存之第七師團，亦悉被日軍制其死命，甚至陣睨孟加拉平原，進攻吉大港之戰略態勢，亦行將完成。就最近敵軍之情狀觀之，自今春阿拉坎進攻作戰以來，活躍於馬猶山脈之英印軍第五師團，頃亦因日軍在布其頓孟多方面之猛攻而陸續撤退，南部戰綫一帶已見動搖，該方面戰况，有更行活潑之勢。</p>
<p>仰光二十四日中央社電　日軍對敵第二十師團之據點巴列爾東方十公里之半永久縱深陣地實施進攻，激戰至烈，卒佔領已列爾要塞主要陣地丹克諾哈爾之重要據點，更掃蕩其他陣地敵軍，二十日已完全佔領該要塞。日軍自於本月十日突破中央陣綫以來、盡夜力戰，終於十日內陷落丹克諾巴爾要塞，該耍塞與摩勒·格納特匹克同樣為馬尼布爾三要塞。敵軍於喪失丹克諸巴爾後，巴列爾之敵第二十師團主力部隊，絡續集合主力於巴列爾東南八公里塞保姆附近之第二綫陣地，企圖堅守巴列爾之最後一錢，但日軍於佔　丹克諾哈爾之高地後，已俯瞰敵陣地，可制扼巴列爾敵軍之死命。</p>
<h3>東南亞司令部　發表聲明　苦惱完全暴露</h3>
<p>廣州二十四日中央社電　反軸心軍東南亞洲軍從軍記者團，不滿當局之檢閱，曾宣布今後決綴筆不書戰况記事，此舉實將敵方之苦惱完全暴露，使東南亞洲軍當局深為狼狽。據渝方廣播稱：東南亞洲軍司令部二十二日特對新聞記者方面之抗議發表聲明，大意如次：從軍之新聞特派員五名，曾為檢閱記事問題，向本司令部提出抗議，當時本司令部曾解釋謂：關於檢閱記事，係本上官之命令，即見有與現勢齟語者不許發表，該解釋使記者方面深為不滿，本司令部實覺異常抱歉。本司令部自成立以來，即盡量為新聞記者謀求便利，本司令部及第十四軍司令部，均設有新聞班，前綫各司令部亦均為新聞記者設有娛樂設施，故溫凱特少將於秘密工作之際，亦會爲新聞記者謀求特別便利。近來本司令部移至錫蘭島，新聞記事之檢閱，均在本司令部舉行，因此部內更特爲記者設置專用之發報機二架，就此而　，可見本司令部於如何困難中，均爲記者之便利着想也。</p>
<h3>菲島各種建設　飛躍進展中　農產增加礦業復舊觀</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　菲律賓于洛勒爾總統領導下，各種建設均有長足進展，現正力謀完成自給經濟，處理特產物及增强戰力物資，茲將最近各地之建設狀况誌次：北部呂宋加喀揚平原之沃野，現仍處於開發狀能中，該地米。烟葉。玉蜀委及落花生，自戰爭勃發後，因交通不便，至少收藏約若干萬代，頃悉某公司於開發該地之前，先傾全力將　藏之物資運出，料不久即可搬運完畢，同時該地棉產亦頗不惡。又呂宋久亦將開發，南部呂宋代表產物爲麻及椰子樹，馬尼刺麻則到處業生，菲律賓獨立后，曾調整椰子實之收買價格，及增加生活必需品之產量，經過異常良好。北部比哥爾地方之鑛產之開發，亦極順利，又木材因極易向馬尼刺輸入，故最近有大量木材對外輸出，各地大規模之造船所，亦正日以繼夜努力工作，比哥爾地方已積極展開食糧自給運動，故食糧決無問題。又比薩牙地方，戰前農業甘蔴等特產物，曾佔全菲總產額之七成，米及其他農產物多係薩馬。雷泰等各島，亦皆極力加强食糧增產，故本年度比薩牙地區之食糧，已可達白給自足程度。又各地礦產設施，殆均完全恢復舊觀，比薩牙地區之工業，於戰前即曾經營泗水椰十油及製糖等各種工塲等，於戰後積極實施酒精等增產計劃，更漸次復興麻袋，肥皂及椰子炭等工業，最近紡織，烟草各業，亦開始於當地生產。同時，更於比內革羅等地增設製材所，以期擴大造艦事業。民答那哦地方素有菲烏　庫之稱，境內煤鋼等各種礦產，馬尼刺麻，棉花業　　材料及其他各種農產資源，木材水產等天然資源，莫不異常豐富，最近該地監於馬尼刺蘇乃屬重要軍需資源之一，乃對此擬定大規模增產計劃，油漆木造船之製造，於本年度已有數艘下水，幷預定於本年度增加數倍之增產。又為以塔巴三　顏為中心之水產，亦較戰前興盛，醬油乾燥莫及其他食料品之加工，全爲南方兵站基地產業之重要部門，近因澈底展開食糧增產運動，故本年之增收已有相當把握。此外，如某炭鑛已由某鑛業公司之着手開始採掘，今後對菲島之工業界，必可有一大供獻。</p>
<h3>新愛爾蘭空襲　墜毀敵機八架</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　二十二日最，敵戰鬥聯合機隊五十架來襲新愛爾蘭加比恩格，於日軍邀戰結果，擊落其六架，擊毀其二架，日方損害輕微。</p>
<h3>緬褒揚先烈　期掀起全民愛國思想</h3>
<p>仰光二十四日中央社電　緬甸當局為昻揚緬甸國軍之國家意識起見，在全國各地發起英雄表彰運動，二十二日在仰光舉行英雄表彰祭，追念從事緬甸獨立運動之先烈，席間由國防部長溫桑少將宣誓，表明决繼先烈遣志，建立緬甸國軍，並對因反抗暴英屈死獄中之志士，印緬戰爭陣亡將士及頓大五朝時代防衛緬甸之諸將領等，一栟予以褒揚，以期掀起緬甸全民之愛國思想。</p>
<p>印緬前綫　日軍部隊奮戰記</p>
<p>日軍各精銳部隊向印度國內進攻業已句日，在梅期南方伊姆法爾盆地入口的隘道，壓迫敵人，展開激戰，不顧疲勞，以勇往直前的精神，漸次擊破英印軍的堅强抵抗，其辛勞實難以　　形容。作戲一開始，各迂向部隊即在竹筒中裝了幾天用的糧秣，再帶了水一同出發。兵器彈藥自不必說，更比普通作戰時帶得多，蓋早已料到進擊前途的困難。乾季的琴丘陵高地，水量極少，馬匹部隊把幾根竹筒中所準備的水都給馬飲完了，而不能不以行軍疲勞之驅，向幾公里之外的山谷汲取谷水。為躱避敵機，行軍總選在夜間，黑暗而密林的山道，極難行走。</p>
<p>馱馬和牛踏空了足就墮落谷底，因為過於疲勞了，敵機時常在拂曉薄暮舉炊的時候出現。為了飛機的　聲而熄炊火，已是司空見慣。曾有七次煮了生飯。六千至八千呎的琴丘陵高地是很嚴塞的，然而開納第峯，德地姆，頓扎恩，興蓋爾契加等地都攻下了。</p>
<p>被服糧秣堆積如山</p>
<p>敵陣地有遺葉着滿染血跡的冬外套，東　衣，粗糙的毛布。着了夏季軍衣進擊的將士，不能不與嚴寒交戰。防寒之具除彈藥糧秣外，僅一張攜帶天幕。此外就祗有利用敵陣中遺棄的冬物。這些都是因進擊而捨棄下來的。將土們滿懷着如火的鬥志，　着硬麵包，耐着寒冷　燥，克服一切困難，壓迫敵軍。</p>
<p>用這極大的難辛所奪取的敵方主耍陣地，遺棄下的被服糧秣，堆如山積。罐頭的乳酪，牛油，乾牛肉，全姆，，水菓，蔬菜，麵粉，薯粉等都是美國，澳洲製造的。糧盡的攻略部隊，得到這邱吉爾與羅斯福的贈品，都大為欣喜。然而仍得追擊，繼續困苦與缺乏的行軍。</p>
<p>戰果道樣擴大開來，而英印軍的命運，也一天天短促了。（譯自四月十七日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<p>印國民軍進行奇襲</p>
<p>在披頰的驟雨下，印度國民軍及　導的琴丘陵土人穿過密林，突入襲擊敵旅團司令部。這是薄　進迫加巴谷地的奇製戰。僅　　名的印度國民軍部隊，敢於從事遺勇敢的襲擊戰，正說明了敵方懷柔政策的破綻。大柬亞的各民族現在在自己的體騐中認識了應走的路途了。三月二十六日拂曉，敵旅團司令部欲從達姆西南三十公里的開果部落宿營地移動，但被附近的　族人發見了。</p>
<p>精悍而重戒律的琴族人，在熟悉的加巴谷地的密林中，跋山涉水迂回繞出敵旅團司令部的背後。後面跟着印度國民軍，正在秘密待機的時候，驟雨沛然下降，全體乃乘機肉搏襲擊。狼狽的敵人，毫無準備，四散潰走，鹵獲　藏在密林中的手溜彈三十八個，埋於地下的大型地雷五個，大型自動步槍子彈四十二萬發，步槍六，大型地雷二百，每捆六十罐的罐頭食品五十捆，其他許多食糧。確保扼加巴谷地要衝的地點，使日軍容易前進，安然無阻。犧牲者僅被敵巡察隊擊斃琴族人一名。（譯自四月十七日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>渝通貨問題　情形日嚴重　發動儲蓄圖吸收游資</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據可靠方面消息，重慶財政部長兼中國銀行董事長孔祥熙，最近為消化公債，勸誘國民儲蓄，企圖吸收游資，緊縮通貨，奔走頻繁。但觀諸過去情形，加以推斷，實極難實現，查重慶今年發行公債十萬萬元，運前發公債總額為九十八萬萬元，另有美金公債二萬萬元，及地方公債移歸重慶者，亦有一萬萬七千萬元之鉅。但其消化額僅達二成，故唯有增加法幣發行數量，用資維持。所以儘　每年</p>
<p>紙幣遲增</p>
<p>發行數額極為驚人。據渝方於民國二十九年發表紙幣之發行數額，為三十九萬萬六千二百萬元，此後即無正式發表。但於重慶雜誌報章中，偶爾亦有披露，以此綜合統計，重慶通貨，發行至民國三十一年，約增二百八十萬萬元，至三十二年四月，再增二百萬萬元。再依此比例推算，目前重慶紙幣當增至一千萬萬元左右。重慶當局鑒於通貨膨脹之影響，於產業工商界極大，故最近竭力設法，使一般民衆</p>
<p>實行儲蓄</p>
<p>規定今年國民備蓄為二百二十九萬萬，以實行通貨緊縮，其辦法如下：各省實行義務儲蓄，規定為四川省四十萬萬元，重慶市二十萬萬元，雲南省三十萬萬元，廣東·廣西·福建·陝西·甘肅·各十二萬萬元，其他各地則六萬萬八萬萬五千萬等不一。其中數額長大者為四川，計共六十萬萬元之鉅，以重慶一市而論，全市人口數為六十萬，欲負担二十萬萬元之儲款，每年每人平均即須儲蓄三千二百元，欲達此目標</p>
<p>自屬難能</p>
<p>蓋民國三十年，重慶國民儲蓄運動開始，至三十二年八月止，二年半中國民儲蓄總額為六十萬萬元，其中重慶一市佔二十萬萬元，餘則為其他各省巿之國民儲蓄。但現在要於一年中，實現過去二年半國民備蓄之總額，當然困難重重。於此種困難中，通貨膨脹的現象，又將因此而發生，而且在渝美軍　之增加，大部份美金均折合當地通貨使用，故重　即以通貨膨脹之辦法來維持，觀此重慶通貨問題，將日趨嚴重云</p>
<h3>國府周會</h3>

<p>松本市立岡書館中書庫中，發見中國所無，日本僅有一部的「宋刋本前漢書」百卷本（最後一卷缺）。該書為帝國圖醫館囑託書誌學研究家長澤規矩也氏，當調查該館所藏古刋本一萬餘冊時所發見者。此外尙有元和活字本「貞觀政耍」十冊，高松板「隋書」二十五冊，及中國傳來之貴重本百十五冊。「宋刋本前漢書」為時價一萬圓，元和活字本為市價一千圓之珍本。據三才館長談該珍太之歸松本圖書館之來歷如次：</p>
<p>珍本來歷</p>
<p>所發現之「宋刊本前漢書」，判行於南宋　宗　元四年，為距今七百四十元前之珍本。恐日本亦祇有一二部。此書記有成恩寺所藏之銘記，成恩寺之山城國山崎，為該寺開山祖師奇山圓然之師。東福寺之開山祖師聖一國師，於嘉禎元年入宋，仁政二年（距今七○三年）歸國時，曾携書萬卷而歸，此書或為當時所撓歸者。至於歸松本之來歷，據「經籍訪古誌」上所著錄者，為近世漢書英集家狩谷擁齋所藏，即就裝楨之字體而觀，亦似為擁齋所藏品。幕末時代松本藩儒者松原葆齋，遊學江戶時，得此書，即以之寄贈圖書館。該書在書誌學上殊為重要，誠可尊之為國實。（譯自四月十四日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>希臘三艦　叛變經過</h3>
<p>安加拉二十四日中央社電　據海通社訊，開羅消息：在反軸心國方面服登三希臘戰艦之叛亂，係舉行示威贊成組織左傾之新希臘流亡政府。據開羅傳出消息，常朱德樂氏內閣辭職之訊發出之後，希臘驅逐艦「阿普斯托里斯」號「勒拉斯」號及「蘇克托里斯」號即發生叛變。該三艦於四月七日拒命出發，英聯絡員登艦時見該艦被一委員會所控制，該會委員稱，一俟新政府成立，即可履行命令，同日在岸上之希臘水手二百人自鎖於一軍獄中，用物堵塞，拒絕離去。擴最後消息，希臘之叛變者業被解除武裝。</p>
<h3>芬蘇兩國　和平無望　芬發表談判經過</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　據赫爾辛基電，芬蘭政府二十三日發表：芬政府對蘇政府之停戰條件已予拒絕。該公報首闡明芬蘭總統巴錫基維博士與外長恩　爾會於三月二十七日訪蘇，並考慮蘇外交人民委員長莫洛托夫之停戰條件等事實後，擊稱，芬政府曾於四月十二日於國會中附機以上之條件，一致承認芬政府在四月十一日之　牒中所表明之態度，對蘇政府之覆文內容如次：芬政府愼重檢討蘇政府之各條件後，知其一部條件在技衛上不能實行，且若接受此等條件，則關於保全芬蘭獨立之前提府所提出之條件，經芬政府檢討結果，已確定蘇芬兩國間無訂立永久和平條件之望，實屬遺憾。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據此間報載美聯社消息稱，莫斯科方面料美政府對芬蘭問題即將於外交上有所舉動，據稱，此舉將為蘇方所熱烈歡迎者。蘇方認為美芬保持外交關係，實不　予芬以精神上之支持。故要求改變美芬（關係。</p>
<p>條件內容包含六點</p>
<p>赫爾辛基二十四日中央社電據訊：蘇外交人民委員長莫洛托夫提交芬　代表團巴錫基維及恩　爾之休戰條件，內有六點，　與德斷絕關係，圈禁在芬德軍及車輛，或至遲於四月底遺送軍及車輛出境，為實施上述兩項辦法，蘇聯可與芬蘭以軍事助力，　恢復一九四○年之蘇芬條約，並分期撤退芬軍至一九四○年之邊界，至四月撤退完畢。　立即釋放蘇聯及反軸各國戰　及被　禁平民，如簽訂和平條約而非休戰條約則舉行交換戰虜。　五月份中復員芬軍人百分之五十，繼於六七兩月中減低芬軍力至戰前水準，此條加入和平條約，或於和平與休戰條約之外同時另訂特別協定。　因芬蘭軍事行動所受損書及佔領蘇領土，須賠償損失費六萬萬元，於五年中淸付，此項賠款以貨物償付，如紙·賽　珞·江海船隻。　根據一九二○及一九四○之和平條約，蘇聯割讓與芬之佩查莫地方及其轄境交還蘇聯。　芬蘭加接受上述六項條件，蘇聯可無償放棄租借漠哥及其週圍地之權利。</p>
<h3>德洪羅聯軍　反攻獲進展　上聶斯特蘇渡河未逞</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　海通社訊：此問負責方面息，現在斯丹尼斯勒伙與泰諾波爾迤西作戰之德軍，即最近蘇聯宣稱完全被圍之部隊，德羅洪三國軍隊之活動，使東綫南路之陳地已有相當之改善。三國軍隊在普魯特河上游與聶斯特間，以及在布柯維納區均續向東進展，蘇軍企圖在蒂拉斯波爾（Tiraspol）渡越泛濫之聶斯特河未逞。被圍於勃洛第與柯維爾間之蘇軍騎兵與步兵行將殲滅。德軍在普里具特區突然進攻上斯蒂爾（Styrriver）甚有所獲，德軍向南推進十五公里，佔領有居民之地點多處。德戰地記者特魯德爾述普里貝特澤地之戰事稱，該區無確實之戰綫，僅有一速串之根據地，蘇軍如欲前進非自正面進攻不可，在該區森林與一沼澤地帶作戰之德軍常枕戈待且以防敵軍，該區德軍更長於游擊戰術。</p>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：頃由德軍方面獲悉，洪軍於二十三佔領契羅維茲（羅境北部）以西之古特城（Kuty），而再由哥羅米亞區（舊波境與羅境交界處）向前推進。聶斯　河之南德軍於擊退頑抗之蘇軍後再獲拓展，而使在坦克車支援下反攻之敵受挫。</p>
<p>又訊：蘇軍於日　在大量之坦克車及戰機　護下，向塞伐斯托波爾戰區中之數處展開攻勢，德軍於激戰中獲得攻防戰之全勝，而毀敵坦克車五十七輛。</p>
<h3>中南美諸國的　國粹革命運動</h3>
<p>— 高明</p>
<p>自一月十六日阿根廷宣佈對軸心　交以來，美國自負並且確信業已完成了整個美洲的支配。然之後中南美諸國相繼發生的政治變動，怎樣解擇呢？以阿根廷的國粹派少壯軍人革命的成功為始，接着有巴拉圭革新將校團的進行「暴力政變」的武力革命，哥倫比亞的革命未遂事件，薩拉瓦多的革命軍佔領首都等，均表示國粹派政黨與革新將校團所主動的武力革命之不斷發生。在此以前，玻璃維亞尙有國民革命黨與軍部合謀的反政府革命之成功，而秘魯亦發覺革命未然事件。國粹革命的風潮今正彌漫全美，政治情勢極為騷動不寗。</p>
<p>一　反對美國</p>
<p>我們以為此等襲擊中南美諸國的國粹革命，在反對美國用　道支配美洲這一點上，是究全一致的，各國革命派崛起的近因，乃是為了政府之盲目的追隨美國，外交自主權的喪失，美國的壟斷國內經濟而致社會不安定，此等情形，使南美諸國的人民對美國抱着滿懷忿懣。即就現在各國革命團的要求罷免親英美閣員，彈壓國內親英美派政黨及其他諸份子等看來，亦可以淸楚地知道這事實。且以阿根廷而言，法萊爾政府的樹立，其意義即在於拒絕美國的對軸心宜戰之要求，並努力恢復外交自主權。恰在此時，復傳說有阿根廷首倡的智利，烏拉圭，玻璃維亞諸國間的關稅同盟運動之進展，這是南美諸國之經濟的自主運動之發展，頗堪注目。美國怎樣苦悶地注視這些國粹革命呢？對阿根廷，玻璃維亞兩國新政府，出以何等卑鄙的報復手段呢？對這些事情，有者無可掩飾的反證。在美國以為業已完成了支配美洲的時候，中南美諸國竟至於早就迅急地展開了反對美國的運動，似乎美洲諸國對美國的反盛之深，出人意外。然而知道美國在「善鄰主義」，「共同防衛」的美各下推進的對中南美政策之實體者，認為美洲各國的對美反感，毫不足異。大家都知道，美國對中南美諸國，在政治上則攪亂並破壞各國的政黨政治，乘隙施行干涉內政，在軍事上，則占據各國的戰略要點，獲得美軍隨時進駐的權利，用盡一切手段來侵犯美洲各國的宗主權，說明這些事實者，例如美國曾極迅速且大量的吸收一切戰略物資，對整個美洲從事經濟的掠奪，然美國所保障美洲各國的武器貸與法及其經濟援助，完全是空頭支票，這很淸楚地表現於美洲諸國的對美貿易上。一九四二年度南美諸國的對美貿易出超額，已達二億七千一百萬天元之鉅，但在一九四三年度，僅上半年即達二憶九百萬美元。中南美諸國實負担美國戰爭　源的百分之六十以上，但從姜國所供給的物資，僅燃料一項，不過平時需要量的百分之四十。美國這種片面掠奪的結果，助長中南美各國的通貨膨脹，使一般經濟情勢惡化，食糧問題嚴重，甚至種下了壓迫國民生活，使社會發生不安的種子。</p>
<p>民族自主要求</p>
<p>對美國此種經濟的掠奪與政治宗主權的堅迫而激起的反抗，乃中南美諸國為了民族的目立所不能自己的要求之表現。茍中南美諸國屈服於美國的覇道而盲從，則國內政治的摩擦勢必激化，國內經濟體制勢必崩潰。社會不安的增大，甚至於發展到社會革命，亦將是無可避免的結果。所以中南美諸國要維持國家的生命，希望將來的發展，應從速改變依存美國的態度，恢復自主獨立的國策。目前的國粹運動，顯然其有這種意義，而值我們刮風目相視。</p>

<h3>松平部長談　開辟第二戰綫　德凖備應付有恃無恐</h3>
<p>日本大使館上海事務所極平情報部長，於昨（廿四）日午後三時假華懋飯店八棋，循例會見本市中國方面各報社記者時，對第二戰綫之開　問題，發表意見如次：英美迄今未開闢第二戰綫之原因有下列數點：</p>
<p>蘇聯要求以寇松新綫爲俄國及波蘭之　界，此綫乃第一次世界大戰時英外交大臣所提議者，故英美不得不允蘇聯要求，惟蘇聯態度强硬，英美有所恐懼。</p>
<p>近有在蘇聯居留二十餘年之意大利共產　員一人，最近歸國，在巴特里奧政權活動，因而蘇俄在巴政權之發　權大增。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫有二政權，其一傾向英美，其一傾向蘇聯，近傾向蘇聯之政權，因其領袖基多之活動結果，勢已大增。</p>
<p>英美在印度及意大利軍事失利，且近東情形日趨不穩，英政府開闢第二戰綫，因此大受制肘，關於第二戰綫德國巳準備應付，派遺大軍在英開關戰綫之可能地區，等待敵軍。德　軍士，着於陸地平　戰，故　人於第二戰綫之開關，有恃無恐。　國史汀遜將軍近警告美國民云：美國開聞第二戰綫之損失，非以前之損失可比，人民須作充分凖備，英相邱吉爾亦發表談話，力言總空軍仍强大如昔，第二戰綫，於最短期間，不致　現。</p>

<h3>為證卷市場前途危</h3>
<p>本年度開始以迄今日，華商股票市價，一瀉千里，且有江河日下之勢，同時，物價依然昂騰，益以銀根奇緊，利率奇高，遂使整個經濟市塲，雖不陷於崩潰，業巳形成大東亞戰爭以來從未有過之不景氣。</p>
<p>股票市塲是近代市導繁榮與衰落的一個決定因素，自然無可置等，雖然股票投資與股票投機，同時也是資本市塲能與不能建立的一個決定因素。原來，股票市塲的任務，尤其在戰時　是於企業資金調度以外，須兼以產業資金供給市塲；假令股票市塲是完全基於投機性質的話，那是不如沒有證券市塲之爲愈了。</p>
<p>股票投機是正常資本市塲所絕不應有的現象，一有此種現象，股票價格即將四起風波，證券市塲即將永無寧日。上海是夙富投機性的一個社會，上行下效，積習難返：惟其如此所以負有建立中國資本市塲使命的華商證券交易所，就應當肩起責任來做一個中流砥柱，不應當隨波逐流，以圓無謂之生存，否則何以股業中賢達之士，嘗有主張證交應由官辦者？總之，證券市塲旣與民族工業有齒唇相依之勢，證券之普遍與不合理的狂漲與慘跌，均不當袖手旁觀，更不當於莫狂漲期間，一聽投機份子之掀風作浪，感於其慘跌期聞，一任投機份子之投井下石；此外，證交機構的表裹，必須沼對健全，不當處處因襲從前腐敗官塲之惡習，事事祗知以自私自利爲能事，否則，誰也要爲證交市塲前途危！</p>
<h3>戰時日本的眞相　一萬萬人打成一片，勝利即是生活</h3>
<p>日本一萬萬　民處於苛烈戰局下，與政府發表的「非常　置要網」，採取同一步　，其繁減美英的鬥爭精神，邀而且烈。現在巳無前綫後方之別，我曾在中國三年，回到故國來，對於激變的後方決戰生活，莫不驚嘆。每一個國民克服着苦缺乏的生活，爲祖的存亡，下了最大的決心，向眞倒美英　進，因爲這樣，日本才强！我非常的感激。上海北京等中國大陸的日僑生活，雖然為物價的猛漲瞠目，但是還能過着　衣飽食的生活，我現在　來，將在帝者之見聞　體　到的後方決戰生活之一端，爲中　的僑諸君，介　　　於次：</p>
<p>二重橋前參拜皇居</p>
<p>爲要參　　居。來省　電車　　重　，省　　　　　　星期日也　常自特別代　。一　的　內電　　車，店客　滿，其　半以上　　女　，　　　式的　　，　　　爽，她們　　　地　市中心　的　公　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一　，但也　有人　戲，東西也決不會　人偷去。因爲「爲增　曰飛機，務須節省電燈。」大括　般家庭，晚間十點便熄滅電燈。踏着砂道至二重橋前，道裏無論雨天或雪日，奉拜之人，接踵不絕。胸前斜掛着　章徽號的應召人們，特別引起注意。翠綠的松樹，　立天空，我　們瞻仰及之，不覺感動。沒有別的念頭，衷心只覺得尊貴，周團的人們也這樣想着吧。尤其是將上征途的勇士們，「日本必勝，絕對不敗。」的念頭汕然而生，在靖國神社前亦如此。</p>
<p>試觀市民生活，住在上海的時候，由日太太國來的許多人，給我們說故國　時生活的　烈電　狀態，極其誇大說會　衣服等物資的缺　。好像故國臨到可憂慮的狀態。然而歸來一　，無論都會　村，衣　等都不怎　缺乏。　　　　潔　的衣服，有人說　　　中國的苦力一般，　　　　全是　謊。尤其是年　　　人們，均適應其恣態，　　着長褲，　　　時下的勸勞女性　　在到處貢獻增强戰力。行動活潑，表情明郎。家常便飯，把小米大豆等和人糙米煮食，對於初從上海回來吃慣配給白米的我，雖覺不適，但不知不覺中也習慣了。配給是二合三　，最初者覺不足，但現在都無這種感覺了。其中亦有採取一日兩餐主義的人很多。又如獨身者持有食券的人，吃飯時間一到，　可在外吃飯</p>
<p>獨身生活絕不困苦</p>
<p>三月五日公佈「非常措置要綱」，所有待合室或高等菜館　部停止營業　年，所謂高貴的大菜已不能吃　然而最低限度的生活，由政府予以保障。持有外食券的獨身者，雖然不能吃着　　美食，但可吃　飽　。我有一個由南方第一綫回來的友人·新近結了婚，據地說　給量　以够了。原來日本人是粗食的靑菜主義，况時而有牛肉猪肉的配給，所以可過着舒服的生活了。</p>
<p>婦女少年勤勞工作</p>
<p>在街上行走的時候，可以看到年靑的小姐們在帮助各軍站搬運貨物。又學童亦在空地帮助掘　待避　。因爲抱着敵機是一刻一時都不　等候我們的澈底思想的緣故。一方面橋　的　干或百貨公司的鐵梯，洋房的電梯，水汀等等都拆下來，供給了很多的　　類。商店的鐵　亦很有用塲，六樓七樓的百貨公司，整理了貨品，大抵減少爲三四　，所售的東西，也局限於戰時生活必需之物。現在未婚的女子，至四十歲止全部被動員，獻身勤勞。我所熟悉某家的小姐，剛在女學校畢業，便希望直接到軍需工廠去，不願意當銀行辦事員，父親母親也很喜歡地送她去。</p>

<h3>關於滬勇交通</h3>
<p>— 聶士</p>
<p>戰前滬甬交通，向稱利，各航商莫不競相招徠以便行旅。目前則旅行</p>
<p>船隻十減少航期延長</p>
<p>戰前行於滬　綫上者凡七八輪；每日無間，隔宿即達，殊無長駐久候之苦。目前則僅有二輪維持航綫，航期則反見延長，蓋輪船在滬南二地各多擱一是也。固然値此戰爭緊張船隻缺乏之際，我人對於船隻之增加，常屬奢望，惟願各船公司考　戰前每日二地對開之辦法，如能實行，無異增加船只，對</p>
<p>購票不易黑市飛漲</p>
<p>由於粥少僧多乃有黑市之出現。按黑市票價與船公司所定相較少則高出五倍，多則十倍。此項黑市票全由各旅行社（或由黑市掮客）賣出，而直接向船公司購票者，則雖駐足久候而十不得一焉。於此，我人不得不懷疑該項黑市票是否由船公司有意或無意製造者，而各旅行社之經售黑市票亦屬非法交易無繳。且也，黑市票之購買者大都係屬單幫商，彼等以有利可圖，只求有票可買，對價格之高下固不計較，而一般正當旅行者則雖願出高價而不得黑市票。於此，取締黑市票戰為解決此一問題之要着，則除禁止旅行社非法交易，而由船公司直接按公正辦法售與旅行者外別無也法。</p>
<p>船上擁　而碍衛生　按理有一票即有一舖位，實則雖有票尙需向房出　位費（其數二三百元不等），即有一舖位，亦決不得舒足暢睡，蓋左右前後皆有票無舖位之乘客也，其擁護之狀較之火車猶有過之。我人猶憶過去輪船。退一步言，雖未必發生慘案，値此夏令將屆，瘟　盛行，有碍衛生不言可喻矣。</p>
<p>此聞船公司當局為消滅黑市票起見，將船票價格加以調整（四月　二日起），約較原定價格漲起百分之二百至三百。若此調整票價，即謂可改善交通情况，則免過於樂觀。惟恐水漲船高，徒苦旅客而已。我人以為根本問題在於改善售票辦法，原則上可以下列數點為準：　由船公司直接售票，不假他人之手，　船票應售予正當旅行者（其法可仿鐵道辦法，限制乘客攜帶行李之簡述及重量；　有一票即有一鋪位（公司應隊茶坊加以訓練，不令　索需，非難旅客，而茶坊小賬可在船票內加收）。以上各點能實現，則吾勇同鄉必額手稱慶也。</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田雄　洪洋譯</p>
<p>（是震珠灣！）</p>
<p>眞人等都心照不　地，肯定了這一點　然　開了眞珠　的　景時，美國汽車駕駛員兵，使特意提高了　度。在椰十樹，民　房舍，　陵崗山等不斷妨　之下，眞人却一心一意地注口細看。</p>
<p>（有「企業」號！）</p>
<p>在綠色的海面上，漂浮着烏賊魚背似的航空母艦。</p>
<p>（也有「印度巡捕」號！）</p>
<p>這個艦型，眞人把牠記到心裹。此外還有兩三艘　逐艦。</p>
<p>（呵，是索敵艦隊！）</p>
<p>於是他愈發注意地看，而愈發增加了比賽武術時的緊張情緒。</p>
<p>過了片刻，他非常愉快了。愉快得，想要躲汽車裏的底板－</p>
<p>（十）</p>
<p>出港的那一天，磐手邀請日本僑民，召開家鄉會宴。　人也領導着多　關照的醫生全家，參觀　魚飯和團糕等的模型店，還　戰賞劍道比賽。</p>
<p>但，他的心却與四周圍的笑聲，非常不相調和。這並不是對於會樂，尚虛榮的後代男女，所起的反感。而是因為看過眞珠灣後的感慨，在心板上又反映出來所致。</p>
<p>三時，家鄉宴會完畢，被請客人即成爲送客者，在岸壁上築起黑黝黝的長城。</p>
<p>「哈囉，喂！敬祝一路平安！」</p>
<p>醫生還是花費了很多錢，買到一束高價的鮮花，披到眞人的肩上。</p>
<p>出港的時間到了，艦內拉唋號聲，響澈雲　。候補生們，整隊排列在甲板上，施行岸壁上歡呼的答禮。片刻問，艦隊向着夏威夷島的希羅，出港了。站在汽車蓋上揮動着帽子的醫生形影，遂漸小了。駛到港外，爲使領港下船，而稍停了一下。送行的打漁船和汽艇，　揚着做送的長條旗幟，集合到本艦的周圍來。</p>
<h3>收音機收費問題　廣播協會的答復</h3>
<p>四月十八日國民論壇所載嚴介雄先生一函，所述一切，茲僅答　如下：</p>
<p>最近徵收無綫電收　機收聽費時，因許可證遣失及收音機所有人　更等，情形相當增長，故特設立問詢處，　　辦理手續之迅速。此蓋因收聽費制度草創伊始，各聽衆對於法定及章程尚感生疏，乃有詢間處之設立。至於許可證遺失時補發之手續及手續費等，即巳有通告張掛，相信不致發生收取小費等不正當行爲。</p>
<p>本科除內勤職員之外，尚有外勤職員，大部份均爲華人，如嚴君函中所述，聞有收取小費之傳說，則無論如何當發生於華人職員與華人聽衆之問。此蓋因互相缺乏自重所致，誠不勝遺憾。故若在規定費用之外有所要求者，請立即予以拒絕，並報告</p>
<p>又關於嚴君函中所提議之三項，答證如下：</p>
<p>用臨時許可證似可繳納收聽非，但臨時許多證之號碼與正式許可證之號碼不同，若盡用臨時許可證，對於辦理之手續，頗感困難，故須以臨時許可證再行申請換正式許可證，但毋須保證人。</p>
<p>又要求提示上期付款首條者蓋因正式許可證遺失時，或納費至某月份為止不明了時，必須加以參考，故必須妥予保存。</p>
<p>並乘此機會，特致一言，請各　衆特別主義，「播音乃為諸位聽衆而設」，因之為使廣播事業明朗起見，請各聽眾復合責任之一半，使使不致再有未經許可之收音機及消滅賄賂等行為，敬希位聽衆協力，不勝盼　之至。上海　台收聽科啓。</p>
<p>糙米勝於白米　持之有恒轉弱為強　健人</p>
<p>住在上海的人們，過去都　食白米，對於糙米，一向是表示粗糙，難以下咽的　但是，在食物　項上說，往往價値昂貴，美味適口的，對人體營養，並不是最豐富，相反的，靑菜，豆腐，糙米飯，如能日日持之以恒，却比任何山珍海味滋補得多，因爲在糙米飯的中間，大凡各種營養費料，差大多應有盡有，健康的人能够使身體更趨壯建，身體參弱多病的，如能對這種糙米，發生喜悅之心，常能保持甘美的味道，則病弱之體可重復健康。我國醫學大家丁食糙米飯，為強身之惟一良法，並親自奉行，以身作則，故今雖顧古稀高年，而身體之強健，精神之飽滿，尤以過於一般青年呢</p>
<p>就是以筆者經　所得，自白米購得困難而又價昂，改食糙米以來，覺得身體比前，更爲堅强結實，一二年中，並未生過一次病，這大約是受糙米之賜了。爰不耽自秘，公之於世，雖爲老生常談，要不失爲有裨實際的良法。</p>
<h3>木紡機　實騐報告</h3>
<p>閱四月廿二日朱述訓君「提倡土紗土布應改良木紡機一文」，筆者亦有同感。關於木舫機，市上雖屢見出售廣告，但成績未能合乎理想。筆者努力研究，於茲年餘，近已稍有成就，撚度約與十六支相等。此機完全用硬樹製造，各地均能取材，每機六十錠，每天工作十小時，每錠能紡紗一兩，每機能紡紗六十兩，上項產量，猶係生手女工管理，若訓練純屬，則尙能增加產量，現在鄉中已開始紡紗織布，達到自紡自識目的，有志共同研究者，請通函餘姚路四三九號劉振耀接洽。</p>
<h3>嘉惠貧民　樂善會小本貸金</h3>
<p>上海樂善會理事長黃燕堂君，近出資舉辦小本貸金，嘉惠貧民，殊爲可佩。申請手續。可向海寧路八五八弄七號該會接洽</p>
<h3>送疾丸</h3>
<p>本社備有靈效之和玉　疾丸五百包，托上海黃山路（舊金神父路）六十九號至七十一號天吉堂國藥號代送，息者可至該號索取，並有特效之鵝掌　油贈送，但須自帶貯器。東台和記藥社謹啓。</p>
<h3>新普育堂　各部設備</h3>
<p>養老院　人生至晚境，生活無依靠，乃由該堂收容。體力較强的帮助堂務。有宿舍，餐室各一大間，餐室中，亦有長檯，長凳，飯後供給他們閒坐，或做縫級之用，人數男六十四，女七十。</p>
<p>貧病院　設有男女病房兩座，每座可容二百五十病人，設備完美，整齊淸潔，雖屬免費，竟能與市上收費之醫院並駕齋驅，人數方面，男的八十四，女的六十九。</p>
<p>門診部　每施醫給藥，約二百餘人，前來求治，均係南市貧民。疾病較重者，並予免費留住病房</p>
<p>灶頭間　設有日二丈的大灶，還有六只大　子（每只可供五百人食用）。每天三餐，早上粥，中午飯，晚上麵食，每天都是吃素的，得有葷菜。最近，爲了米價的飛漲，所以也有些無米之炊的恐慌了。</p>
<h3>自警亭　應保持清潔　勿成乞丐宿舍</h3>
<p>保甲制度創辦以來，自警團崗位設置自警亭，有係募購，有係捐贈，內以前者為多。數量在前八區，每聯保一座，一區因聯保劃分區域較廣，座數當亦加多，每一聯保設置三四五座不等，按設置警亭之爲用，在供自警團員休息及遮　風日，法至良善。然我國人缺乏公德心，對公物（自　亭）任意損壞，保甲長見之，亦漢不關心，毫不加以保護。猶之此非我物，祇具形式而已。致各區警亭一部份均殘缺不全，有碎玻璃有缺窗戶，甚至坐板擱板被竊，門鎖不寬而飛，好在警亭尙未搬走，乃算大幸替入暫借一宿，（每晶不斷）　晨團員上崗，乞兒猶酣睡正農，鼾聲呼呼，用棍驅之，始蹣跚股而去。日久亭內白風薈集，惡者更泥其中，臭氣觸鼻，令人作　。設團員置身亭中，不傳得進疫病幾希。况今後時日暖，為害更神，亟盼各聯保負責人員，加以清除，每週洗刷一次，窗戶殘缺玻璃碎者，應遠修理，並裝門鎖。每晚由最後落差自警團員負責上鎖，使丐兒不能人內，並察查損壞者，處以修價數倍之罰金，庶幾　亭得以保持應有之整潔。（沈朝中）</p>

        <h1>1944 - n112</h1>
<h3>Opening of the Medical Congress</h3>
<p>The Third East Asia Medical Congress held its opening ceremony in Beijing today, with special lectures to be held in Shanghai starting on the 26th. Over a hundred representatives are attending, bringing together the elite of the medical community from the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to discuss ways to improve the health of all nations within the sphere and to contribute to the Greater East Asia War effort. This will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the future of East Asian medicine. China, as the host of this congress, extends a particularly warm welcome to the attendees. At the same time, from the perspective of the Chinese people, we hope that the distinguished representatives will offer special guidance on two points.</p>
<p>How to advance Chinese medical education and the health of the nation depends on both physical training and disease prevention and treatment. Physical training is promoted through sports. Disease prevention and treatment are the responsibility of physicians, and the institutions that train physicians are medical education facilities. China's modern medical education has a very short history, and after the recent events, many hospitals and medical schools have unfortunately been forced to close. Therefore, in the past, we merely felt the inadequacy of physicians, but now there is a real shortage. On January 31st of this year, the Japanese House of Representatives proposed establishing more medical schools and enrolling more medical students. We further advocate that enemy-property hospitals returned to Chinese management should be immediately used to establish medical colleges, taking the form of independent institutions without large organizations, making them places of education and practice (see the February 5th editorial). The equipment of a medical college is naturally more than that of a single hospital, and basic medical courses are closely related to biology, physics, and chemistry, but it would be easier to improve an existing institution by seeking assistance from all parties to add various facilities. At the same time, we further advocate that allied Japan transfer schools to China, not only in medical education but also in other fields, and medical education is even more crucial to national health. The representatives at this medical congress are all leaders in the medical field and pioneers in medical education, and we hope for their fullest cooperation and support in promoting Chinese medical education.</p>
<p>How to develop public health in China. Historically, wars invariably lead to population decline and increased mortality rates. The highest mortality rates are often not due to direct combat but to diseases indirectly influenced by the war. Among disease-related deaths, the most are often caused by infectious diseases. As the saying goes, "After a great war, there will be epidemics." Therefore, epidemics are a fatal threat to the nation. In recent years, epidemics such as cholera and meningitis have been prevalent, sometimes to the point of being uncontrollable. The people are the foundation of the nation, and the reduction in the number of citizens inflicts the greatest damage on national strength. How to prevent, treat, and isolate these diseases requires immediate planning and implementation. After the war, China's domestic public health research facilities, experimental equipment, specialized personnel, and supplies are all inadequate, and close assistance from friendly nations is needed to promote success.</p>
<p>A Chinese proverb says, "If not a good prime minister, then a good doctor." A good prime minister and a good doctor have different roles but share the same goal of saving the people. Comparing a prime minister and a doctor shows the traditional Chinese emphasis on good doctors. Now that "good doctors" from the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are gathered together, they will surely save the people of Greater East Asia, and the Chinese people offer their heartfelt blessings.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Prepares for Major Offensive Against Imphal; Western Heights of Kohima Captured</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from the Burma Front, 24th: Since the start of the operations in Burma and India, time has quickly passed. The Japanese forces approaching the Imphal plain are now reorganizing their formations and preparing to launch a major offensive against Imphal. The Japanese forces south of Imphal are currently compressing the enemy's ring-shaped defensive formation. The enemy troops, concentrated in an area 60 kilometers long and 40 kilometers wide, are launching fierce counterattacks, but the Japanese forces are repelling them each time. When the opportunity arises, they will annihilate them in one fell swoop. The 1st, 49th, and 37th Brigades of the 23rd Division, the 20th Division, the 23rd Division, the 80th, the 100th Divisions and Brigades, the remnants of the 17th Division, part of the 48th, 24th, and 63rd Brigades, and 4,000 enemy reinforcements and armored brigades supplied by air, totaling tens of thousands of troops under the enemy's Fourth Corps, are making extreme efforts to reverse the decline, trying to avoid the annihilation attack of the Japanese forces in the Loktak Lake wetland area. The key roads in Imphal City are fortified with Tretre-style fortresses and multiple layers of fortifications. The rear of the positions in front of the city are filled with barracks for reserve troops. On the 23rd, in front of the Japanese forces advancing from the southern direction of Tinsongkhong and Bishenpur, a brigade of the enemy's 23rd Division and several thousand troops actively prepared for battle in the rear position of Tekchou Nopal under air cover. The formation they constructed was almost entirely a ring-shaped defensive formation like those used in the Arakan campaign, to facilitate aerial resupply in the rear. However, no matter how strong the positions are, they cannot withstand a single attack by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, 24th: The five hundred stubborn enemies on the western heights of Kohima were completely defeated by the fierce attacks of the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces by dawn on the 21st. They set fire to the dense forest, trying to escape the encirclement of the Japanese-Indian forces under the cover of the confusion. However, the Japanese-Indian troops disregarded everything and pursued the defeated enemy. By noon that day, they had completely occupied the high ground and were now pursuing and killing the defeated enemy everywhere, launching a major annihilation battle. Thus, after ten days of fierce fighting day and night since the 9th, the enemy's strongholds were also captured, and the battle to annihilate the remaining enemies around Kohima has come to an end. The high ground was the enemy's only position around Kohima. Although the enemy lost the high ground, they deny that the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces completely captured Kohima in order to prevent the morale of their domestic population from being shaken.</p>
<h3>Japanese Offensive in Central and Southern Border Areas of Burma and India Intensified; Enemy Troops Retreating from Mayu Mountains</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, 24th: The Japanese offensive in the southern border area of India and Burma is being launched in coordination with the battle to capture Imphal, and is unfolding step by step. In particular, since the fall of Paletwa, a key point in the Kaladan River valley, on the afternoon of the 20th, the Japanese offensive operations against India have suddenly intensified. The enemy troops in the southern border area of India and Burma deployed the British-Indian 7th and 5th Divisions in the Mayu Mountains at the beginning of this spring as the vanguard for retaking Burma. However, since February 4th, the Japanese army has switched to the offensive, annihilating the main force of the British-Indian 7th Division and containing the 26th Brigade of the British-Indian 5th Division within the Mayu Mountains, inflicting annihilation strikes on them at every opportunity. After entering March, they further attacked the West African 81st Division coming to aid from the south in the Kaladan River valley, and then launched an offensive into India in the central border area of India and Burma. As a result, the enemy, who had repeatedly lost the initiative, panicked. In the first ten days of March, they could only send parachute troops to land in the northern area of Kyauktaw to carry out guerrilla warfare, but these stopgap measures were of no avail. Now, the Imphal plain has become a major bridgehead for the Japanese army to conduct offensive operations against India. The fortress of Paletwa in the Kaladan River valley is also in the hands of the Japanese army, so that not only is the rear of the Mayu Mountains, which was initially relied upon as a base for counterattacking Burma, threatened by the Japanese army, but also the 26th Division of the British-Indian army and the remnants of the 7th Division in the Arakan area are all controlled by the Japanese army, and even the strategic posture of eyeing the Bengal plains and attacking Chittagong is about to be completed. Judging from the recent situation of the enemy, since the Arakan offensive operation this spring, the 5th Division of the British-Indian army, which had been active in the Mayu Mountains, has also been gradually retreating due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army in the Buthidaung-Maungdaw area. The entire southern front is showing signs of wavering, and the battle situation in that area is becoming even more active.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, 24th: The Japanese army launched an offensive against the semi-permanent deep positions of the enemy's 20th Division, ten kilometers east of Palel. The fighting was fierce, and finally, the main stronghold of Dankokhar, a key point of the Palel Fortress, was captured, and the enemy troops in the other positions were cleared out. The fortress was completely occupied on the 20th. Since breaking through the central front on the 10th of this month, the Japanese army fought through the night and finally captured the Dankokhar Fortress within ten days. The fortress, like Moréh and Kanglatongbi, is one of the three fortresses of Manipur. After losing Dankokhar, the main force of the enemy's 20th Division in Palel successively assembled their main force in the second-line positions near Seibom, eight kilometers southeast of Palel, attempting to defend the last line of Palel. However, after occupying the high ground of Dankokhar, the Japanese army was able to overlook the enemy's positions and control the fate of the enemy in Palel.</p>
<h3>Southeast Asia Command Issues Statement, Reveals Complete Distress</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Guangzhou, 24th: The fact that the war correspondents of the anti-Axis Southeast Asian Army were dissatisfied with the authorities' censorship and announced that they would stop writing war reports in the future has completely exposed the enemy's distress and deeply embarrassed the Southeast Asian Army authorities. According to a broadcast from Chongqing, the Southeast Asian Army Command issued a statement on the 22nd in response to the protests from the press, the gist of which is as follows: Five war correspondents have protested to this command regarding the issue of censoring articles. At that time, this command explained that the censorship of articles was an order from our superiors, and that anything that contradicted the current situation was not allowed to be published. The reporters were deeply dissatisfied with this explanation, and this command feels extremely apologetic. Since its establishment, this command has done its best to facilitate the work of journalists. Both this command and the 14th Army Command have established press sections, and the front-line commands have also provided recreational facilities for journalists. Therefore, Major General Wingate also sought special conveniences for journalists during secret operations. Recently, this command moved to Ceylon Island, and the censorship of news articles is now carried out at this command. Therefore, the department has specifically set up two dedicated telegraph machines for journalists. From this, it can be seen that this command has always considered the convenience of journalists in the midst of its difficulties.</p>
<h3>Various Constructions on the Philippine Islands are Progressing Rapidly; Agricultural Production Increases and Mining Restored to Original State</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 24th: Under the leadership of President Laurel of the Philippines, various constructions have made considerable progress, and efforts are now being made to complete a self-sufficient economy, process specialty products, and enhance strategic materials. The current status of construction in various regions is as follows: The fertile fields of the Cagayan Plain in northern Luzon are still in the process of being developed. Due to transportation difficulties since the outbreak of the war, at least hundreds of thousands of tons of rice, tobacco, corn, and peanuts have been stored there. It is reported that before developing the area, a certain company is making every effort to transport out the stored materials and expects to complete the transport soon. At the same time, cotton production in the area is also quite good. Luzon is also being developed. Abaca and coconut trees are the representative products of southern Luzon. Manila hemp is growing everywhere. After the independence of the Philippines, the purchase price of coconuts was adjusted, and the production of essential goods was increased, with exceptionally good results. The development of mineral products in the Bicol region of northern Luzon is also proceeding smoothly. Because it is very easy to import timber to Manila, a large amount of timber has recently been exported. Large-scale shipyards in various places are also working hard day and night. The Bicol region has actively launched a food self-sufficiency campaign, so there is no problem with food. In the Visayas region, before the war, agricultural specialties such as sugarcane accounted for 70% of the total production of the entire Philippines. Rice and other agricultural products are mostly from the islands of Samar and Leyte, which are also making every effort to increase food production, so the Visayas region is expected to achieve food self-sufficiency this year. The mineral facilities in various places have almost completely restored their original appearance. Before the war, industry in the Visayas region had operated various factories such as Surigao coconut oil and sugar manufacturing. After the war, they actively implemented plans to increase alcohol production and gradually revived industries such as burlap sacks, soap, and coconut charcoal. Recently, the textile and tobacco industries have also begun local production. At the same time, sawmills are being added to the Bicol region to expand the shipbuilding industry. The Mindanao region, known as the "Philippine Treasure House," is exceptionally rich in various natural resources such as coal, steel, and other mineral products, Manila hemp, cotton yarn materials, other agricultural resources, timber, and aquatic products. Recently, given that Manila hemp is an important military supply resource, a large-scale increase plan has been formulated for this. Several oil tankers were launched this year. The manufacture of wooden ships is also expected to increase several times this year. In addition, aquatic products centered on Tabasam is more prosperous than before the war. The processing of soy sauce, dried fish, and other foodstuffs is an important part of the Southern Army base industry. Recently, a thorough food production increase campaign was launched, so a considerable increase in harvest is expected this year. In addition, a certain coal mine has been started for excavation by a certain mining company, which will surely make a major contribution to the industrial world of the Philippines in the future.</p>
<h3>Air Raid on New Ireland, Eight Enemy Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 24th: On the 22nd, a fleet of 50 enemy fighter-bombers attacked Kabienge, New Ireland. As a result of the Japanese military's interception, six were shot down and two were destroyed. Japanese losses were minor.</p>
<h3>Burma Commemorates Martyrs, Hopes to Spark National Patriotic Thought</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, 24th: In order to elevate the national consciousness of the Burmese National Army, the Burmese authorities have launched a hero recognition campaign throughout the country. On the 22nd, a hero recognition ceremony was held in Rangoon to commemorate the martyrs who engaged in the Burmese independence movement. During the ceremony, Defense Minister Major General Aung San swore an oath, stating his determination to carry on the legacy of the martyrs, establish the Burmese National Army, and honor the patriots who died in prison for resisting the British, the soldiers who died in the India-Burma War, and the generals who defended Burma during the Konbaung Dynasty, in order to spark the patriotic thought of the entire Burmese people.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army's Fierce Battle Record on the India-Burma Front</p>
<p>The Japanese army's elite troops have been attacking into India for several days, pressing the enemy in the mountain pass at the entrance to the Imphal Plain south of Manipur, engaging in fierce battles, and gradually breaking down the strong resistance of the British-Indian army with a spirit of courage and advance regardless of fatigue. The hardships are difficult to describe. At the start of the operation, each unit filled bamboo tubes with several days' worth of rations and set off with water. Not to mention weapons and ammunition, they carried more than usual, as they had long anticipated the difficulties of the advance. In the dry season, water is extremely scarce in the Chin Hills. The cavalry units used up all the water prepared in the bamboo tubes for the horses and were forced to trek several kilometers to mountain valleys to draw water, exhausted from marching. To avoid enemy aircraft, the march was always carried out at night, making the dark, densely forested mountain paths extremely difficult to navigate.</p>
<p>Packhorses and cattle often lost their footing and fell into the valleys due to excessive fatigue, and enemy aircraft often appeared at dawn and dusk when cooking. Extinguishing the cooking fire due to the sound of airplanes was commonplace. There were seven instances of cooking half-cooked rice. The Chin Hills, at altitudes of 6,000 to 8,000 feet, are very cold, yet the peaks of Kennedy Peak, Tiddim, Tonhe, and Sanguelchega were all captured.</p>
<p>Clothing and Provisions Piled Up Like Mountains</p>
<p>In the enemy positions, there were winter overcoats stained with blood, tattered uniforms, and coarse wool blankets. The soldiers advancing in summer uniforms had to battle the severe cold. Aside from ammunition and rations, the only defense against the cold was a tent. In addition, they could only use winter items abandoned in the enemy positions. These were all abandoned due to the advance. The soldiers, filled with burning fighting spirit, gnawed on hard bread, endured the cold and dryness, overcame all difficulties, and pressed on the enemy.</p>
<p>The main enemy positions captured with such great difficulty had piles of abandoned clothing and provisions like mountains. Canned cheese, butter, dried beef, jam, fruit, vegetables, flour, potato flour, etc., were all made in America and Australia. The attacking troops, running out of supplies, were greatly delighted to receive these gifts from Churchill and Roosevelt. However, they still had to pursue, continuing the arduous and lacking march.</p>
<p>The battle results continued to expand, and the fate of the British-Indian army grew shorter day by day. (Translated from the April 17th issue of the Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<p>Indian National Army Carries Out Surprise Attack</p>
<p>Under the sudden rain in the Chin Hills, the Indian National Army and the local Chin hillmen they were leading passed through the dense forest and launched a surprise attack on the enemy brigade headquarters. This was a surprise attack to advance toward the Kabaw Valley. The Indian National Army unit, with only a few members, dared to engage in such a brave surprise attack, which shows the flaws in the enemy's appeasement policy. The various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia are now recognizing the path they should take through their own experiences. At dawn on March 26, the enemy brigade headquarters was preparing to move from its campsite in the village of Khaikoi, 30 kilometers southwest of Tamu, but was discovered by local tribesmen in the vicinity.</p>
<p>The disciplined and lean Chin people, familiar with the dense forests of the Kabaw Valley, detoured around the enemy brigade headquarters, traversing mountains and wading through rivers. The Indian National Army followed behind, secretly waiting for an opportunity, when a sudden rain fell. The entire force took the opportunity to launch a surprise attack. The caught-off-guard enemy, completely unprepared, scattered and fled. They seized 38 hand grenades hidden in the dense forest, 5 large landmines buried underground, 420,000 rounds of large automatic rifle ammunition, 6 rifles, 200 large landmines, 50 bundles of canned food (60 cans per bundle), and many other rations. Securing the key points of the Kabaw Valley made it easier for the Japanese army to advance without hindrance. The only casualty was one Chin hillman killed by an enemy patrol.

<h3>Chongqing Currency Problem Becoming Increasingly Serious; Launching Savings Program to Absorb Floating Capital</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: According to reliable sources, Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance of Chongqing and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, has been working frequently to digest government bonds, encourage national savings, attempt to absorb floating capital, and tighten the currency supply. However, based on past experience and inferences, it is extremely difficult to achieve. This year, Chongqing issued 100 trillion yuan in government bonds, and the total amount of government bonds issued before was 98 trillion yuan. In addition, there were 20 billion yuan in US dollar bonds and 17 billion yuan in local government bonds transferred to Chongqing. However, the amount digested only reached 20%, so the only option is to increase the amount of legal tender issued to maintain operations. Therefore, even though every year</p>
<p>Paper Money Gradually Increases</p>
<p>The amount issued is extremely alarming. According to the amount of paper money issued by Chongqing in 1940, it was 39.62 billion yuan. There has been no official announcement since then. However, occasional disclosures have been made in Chongqing magazines and newspapers. Based on this combined statistics, the currency issued in Chongqing increased by about 280 billion yuan by 1942, and then increased by another 200 billion yuan by April 1943. Based on this ratio, it is estimated that the current amount of paper money in Chongqing has increased to about 1 trillion yuan. The Chongqing authorities, recognizing that the impact of currency inflation on industry and commerce is extremely large, have recently made every effort to enable the general public to</p>
<p>Implement Savings</p>
<p>The national savings target for this year has been set at 229 billion, in order to implement monetary tightening. The measures are as follows: Compulsory savings will be implemented in each province, with quotas set at 40 billion yuan for Sichuan Province, 20 billion yuan for Chongqing City, 30 billion yuan for Yunnan Province, 12 billion yuan each for Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Shaanxi, and Gansu Provinces, and varying amounts of 6 billion, 8 billion, and 50 million yuan for other regions. The largest amount is for Sichuan, totaling 60 billion yuan. Taking Chongqing City as an example, with a population of 600,000, it would be required to save 20 billion yuan, which means that each person would have to save an average of 3,200 yuan per year. Achieving this goal</p>
<p>Will Be Difficult</p>
<p>The National Savings Movement in Chongqing began in 1941, and by August 1943, the total amount of national savings in two and a half years was 60 billion yuan, of which Chongqing City accounted for 20 billion yuan, with the remainder being national savings from other provinces and cities. However, it is now required to achieve the total amount of national savings from the past two and a half years within one year, which will certainly be fraught with difficulties. Amid these difficulties, the phenomenon of currency inflation will occur as a result. Furthermore, the increased presence of the US military in Chongqing has resulted in most of the US dollars being converted into local currency for use. Therefore, Chongqing is maintaining operations through currency inflation. In view of this, the currency problem in Chongqing will become increasingly serious.</p>

A single line can be used simultaneously for transmitting text and communication, and even the most complex characters can be clearly transmitted to various locations. Its purpose is to enable news to be quickly transmitted to various newspaper offices and government offices.</p>
<h3>Japanese Matsumoto Library Discovers Song Edition of Former Han Dynasty History</h3>
<p>In the book depository of the Matsumoto Municipal Library, a 100-volume "Song Edition of the Former Han Dynasty History" (the last volume is missing), which is not available in China and only exists in one copy in Japan, was discovered. The book was discovered by Mr. Nagasawa Kikuya, a book historian commissioned by the Imperial Library, when he was investigating more than 10,000 ancient printed books in the library's collection. In addition, there are also the Yuanhe movable type edition of "Zhenguan Zhengyao" in ten volumes, the Takamatsu edition of "Sui Shu" in twenty-five volumes, and 115 valuable books brought from China. The "Song Edition of the Former Han Dynasty History" is a rare book worth 10,000 yen at current prices, and the Yuanhe movable type edition is a rare book worth 1,000 yen at market prices. According to the director of the Sanzai Pavilion, the origin of this rare treasure in the Matsumoto Library is as follows:</p>
<p>Origin of the Treasure</p>
<p>The discovered "Song Edition of the Former Han Dynasty History" was published in the fourth year of Emperor Lizong of the Southern Song Dynasty, making it a rare book from 740 years ago. It is feared that there are only one or two copies in Japan. The book has a inscription indicating that it was collected in the Cheng'en Temple. Cheng'en Temple is located in Yamazaki, Yamashiro Province, and its founder was the teacher of the temple's founder, Kizan Ennen. The founder of Tofuku Temple, Saint Ichikokushi, entered the Song Dynasty in the first year of Kajo and returned to the country in the second year of Ninsei (703 years ago), bringing back 10,000 volumes of books. This book may have been among those brought back at that time. As for its arrival in Matsumoto, according to the record in the "Jingji Fangu Zhi," it was collected by Kariya Ekisai, a modern collector of Han books. Judging from the style of the binding, it also seems to be a collection of Ekisai. At the end of the Edo period, Matsubara Hosai, a Confucian scholar of the Matsumoto domain, obtained this book while studying in Edo and donated it to the library. The book is of particular importance in bibliography and can be truly regarded as a national treasure. (Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, April 14th)</p>
<h3>Course of the Mutiny of Three Greek Warships</h3>
<p>Ankara, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency, a Cairo dispatch: The mutiny of three Greek warships serving on the Allied side was a demonstration in favor of organizing a leftist new Greek government in exile. According to news from Cairo, after the message of the resignation of the Tsouderos cabinet was issued, the Greek destroyers "Apostolis," "Lelas," and "Souktoris" mutinied. On April 7, the three ships refused to depart. When a British liaison officer boarded the ships, he saw that they were controlled by a committee. The committee members stated that they would carry out orders once a new government was formed. On the same day, 200 Greek sailors ashore locked themselves in a military prison, blocked it with objects, and refused to leave. According to the latest news, the Greek mutineers have been disarmed.</p>
<h3>No Hope for Peace Between Finland and the Soviet Union - Finland Announces Course of Negotiations</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Helsinki, the Finnish government announced on the 23rd that it had rejected the Soviet government's armistice terms. The communiqué first clarified the facts that Finnish President Paasikivi and Foreign Minister Enckell visited the Soviet Union on March 27 and considered the armistice terms of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. It then stated that the Finnish government had unanimously acknowledged the attitude expressed by the Finnish government in the message of April 11 with the above conditions at the National Assembly on April 12. The contents of the reply to the Soviet government were as follows: After careful consideration of the Soviet government's conditions, the Finnish government realized that some of the conditions were technically impossible to implement, and if these conditions were accepted, then the conditions proposed by the government regarding the preservation of Finnish independence. After reviewing the conditions, the Finnish government determined that there was no hope of concluding permanent peace conditions between the Soviet Union and Finland, which was regrettable.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: According to the Associated Press news carried by the local newspapers, Moscow expects the US government to take diplomatic action on the Finnish issue soon. It is said that this move will be warmly welcomed by the Soviet side. The Soviet side believes that the maintenance of diplomatic relations between the US and Finland does not provide Finland with spiritual support. Therefore, it demands a change in US-Finnish relations.</p>
<p>Contents of the Terms Include Six Points</p>
<p>Helsinki, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to reports: The Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov submitted the armistice conditions to the Finnish delegation, Paasikivi and Enckell, which contained six points: 1. Break off relations with Germany, detain German troops and vehicles in Finland, or send the troops and vehicles out of the country by the end of April at the latest. To implement the above two measures, the Soviet Union can provide Finland with military assistance. 2. Restore the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of 1940 and withdraw Finnish troops to the border of 1940 in stages, with the withdrawal completed by April. 3. Immediately release Soviet and anti-Axis prisoners of war and detained civilians. If a peace treaty rather than an armistice treaty is signed, then an exchange of prisoners of war will be held. 4. Restore 50% of Finnish troops in the middle of May, and then reduce the Finnish military strength to pre-war levels in June and July. This article will be added to the peace treaty, or a separate special agreement will be signed in addition to the peace and armistice treaties. 5. Compensation for damages and occupation of Soviet territory caused by Finnish military operations must be paid at 600 million yuan within five years. This compensation will be paid in goods, such as paper, cellulose, and seagoing vessels. 6. According to the peace treaties of 1920 and 1940, the Soviet Union will return to Finland the Petsamo region and its jurisdiction. If Finland accepts the above six conditions, the Soviet Union can unconditionally waive the right to lease Hanko and its surrounding areas.</p>
<h3>German, Hungarian, and Romanian Forces Make Progress in Counteroffensive - Soviet Attempt to Cross the Upper Dniester River Fails</h3>

The armies of the three countries have continued to advance east in the upper reaches of the Prut River and between the Dniester and in the Bukovina region. The Soviet attempt to cross the flooded Dniester River at Tiraspol failed. The Soviet cavalry and infantry surrounded between Brody and Kovel are about to be annihilated. The German army suddenly attacked the upper Styr River in the Pripyat area and achieved considerable gains. The German army advanced 15 kilometers to the south and occupied many populated areas. German war correspondent Trudel described the fighting in the Pripyat marshland, saying that there was no clear front line in the area, only a series of strongholds. The Soviet army had to attack head-on if it wanted to advance. The German army fighting in the forests and swamps of the area was constantly on guard against the enemy and was better at guerrilla tactics.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: It has recently been learned from the German military that the Hungarian army occupied the city of Kuty (west of Chernovitz in northern Romania) on the 23rd and then advanced from the Kolomyia region (border between the old Polish border and the Romanian border). South of the Dniester River, the German army repelled the stubborn Soviet army and gained further expansion, thwarting the enemy's counterattack supported by tanks.</p>
<p>Another report: The Soviet army launched an offensive on several locations in the Sevastopol war zone on the same day, with the protection of a large number of tanks and fighter aircraft. The German army won a complete victory in the offensive and defensive battle and destroyed 57 enemy tanks.</p>
<h3>National Essence Revolutionary Movement in Central and South American Countries</h3>
<p>— Gao Ming</p>
<p>Since Argentina's declaration of war against the Axis powers on January 16, the United States has been self-satisfied and confident that it has completed the domination of the entire Americas. However, how do we explain the political changes that have taken place in Central and South American countries one after another? Starting with the success of the national essence faction of young military officers' revolution in Argentina, followed by the armed revolution of the "violent coup" by the Paraguayan renovationist officers' corps, the unsuccessful revolutionary incident in Colombia, and the occupation of the capital by the revolutionary army in El Salvador, etc., all indicate the continuous occurrence of armed revolutions initiated by the national essence party and the renovationist officers' corps. Prior to this, Bolivia had the successful anti-government revolution in which the National Revolutionary Party and the military jointly conspired, and Peru also discovered an unfulfilled revolutionary incident. The tide of national essence revolution is now spreading throughout the Americas, and the political situation is extremely turbulent.</p>
<p>1. Opposition to the United States</p>
<p>We believe that these national essence revolutions that have attacked Central and South American countries are entirely consistent in their opposition to the United States using覇道 to dominate the Americas. The immediate cause of the rise of revolutionary factions in various countries is the government's blind following of the United States, the loss of diplomatic autonomy, and the US monopoly of the domestic economy leading to social instability. These situations have caused the people of South American countries to harbor full resentment towards the United States. Even judging from the current demands of the revolutionary groups in various countries to dismiss pro-British and pro-American cabinet members and suppress pro-British and pro-American political parties and other elements in the country, this fact can be clearly understood. Moreover, taking Argentina as an example, the establishment of the Farrell government meant rejecting the US demand for a declaration of war against the Axis powers and striving to restore diplomatic autonomy. At this time, it was rumored that Argentina was the first to promote the progress of the customs union movement among Chile, Uruguay, Bolivia, and other countries, which is a development of the economic autonomy movement of South American countries and is worthy of attention. How bitterly the United States is watching these national essence revolutions! What despicable retaliatory measures are taken against the new governments of Argentina and Bolivia! There is undeniable evidence for these things. At a time when the United States believed that it had completed the domination of the Americas, Central and South American countries even quickly launched an anti-American movement. It seems that the depth of anti-American sentiment in the American countries is unexpected. However, those who know the reality of the pro-Central and South American policies promoted by the United States under the 美各 of "Good Neighbor Policy" and "Joint Defense" believe that the anti-American sentiment in the American countries is not surprising. Everyone knows that the United States, in the political field, disrupts and destroys the party politics of various countries, seizes the opportunity to interfere in internal affairs, and in the military field, occupies the strategic points of various countries and obtains the right for the US military to station at any time, using all means to infringe on the sovereignty of the American countries. To explain these facts, for example, the United States has rapidly and massively absorbed all strategic materials and engaged in economic plunder of the entire Americas, but the weapons lending law and economic assistance that the United States guarantees to the American countries are completely empty checks. This is clearly manifested in the trade between the American countries and the United States. In 1942, the trade surplus of South American countries with the United States reached a huge amount of 271.1 million yuan, but in 1943, it reached 290 million US dollars in the first half of the year alone. Central and South American countries actually bear more than 60% of the US war 　resources, but the materials supplied by the Jiang country, only fuel, are only 40% of the normal needs. The result of this unilateral plunder by the United States has fueled inflation in Central and South American countries, worsened the general economic situation, seriously affected the food problem, and even sown the seeds of oppressing the lives of the people and causing social unrest.</p>
<p>Demand for National Autonomy</p>
<p>The resistance aroused by this economic plunder and the pressure of political sovereignty by the United States is a manifestation of the unavoidable demand of Central and South American countries for national independence. If the Central and South American countries succumb to the US霸道 and blindly follow, the domestic political friction will inevitably intensify, and the domestic economic system will inevitably collapse. The increase in social unrest, even the development of social revolution, will be an inevitable result. Therefore, in order to maintain the life of the country and hope for future development, Central and South American countries should quickly change their attitude of dependence on the United States and restore an autonomous and independent national policy. The current national essence movement clearly has this meaning and deserves our respect.</p>

<h3>Non-Staple Foods Will Have Restricted Flour Rationing - Flour and Wheat Special Committee is Drafting Measures</h3>
<p>Since the Flour and Wheat Special Committee of the Commercial and Trade Association implemented the unified purchase and distribution of flour and wheat, the purchase and distribution work has been proceeding very smoothly, because the unified system is perfect and flour and wheat merchants can operate under a　　scheme. In addition to granting household flour rations on a regular basis, the committee also handles special flour rations for industries such as cut noodle, flatbread, and fried dough cake industries in order to take into account the business of the relevant food industries in various regions. The Commercial and Trade Association has now approved the plan of the former Ministry of Food to strictly regulate the method of flour rationing for cakes and non-staple food raw materials in order to conserve them. The Commercial and Trade Association has transferred this to the Flour and Wheat Special Committee for verification and handling. It is reported that the Flour and Wheat Special Committee has already studied and stipulated the method of restricting the raw materials for cake and non-staple food rationing. Flour used for fancy pastries will not be rationed, while flour required for biscuits consumed by ordinary people will be rationed in an appropriate manner. Once the method is drafted and submitted to the Commercial and Trade Association for approval, the relevant canned food industries will be notified to comply.</p>
<h3>Sino-Communication and Other Banks Form Syndicate to Buy Spring Cocoons - Total Amount Approximately 100 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The spring silkworms in various regions of Central China and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have all begun to be raised, and new cocoons will soon be on the market. The major silk factories in the city are preparing to purchase spring cocoons and have sent personnel to various producing areas to　　contact farmers and cocoon merchants to negotiate the purchase of cocoons. In order to support the development of the silk industry, the banking community in the city has consulted with silk manufacturers and other parties on joint loans for cocoon purchase, and the principles have been determined. The total amount of loans is approximately 100 million yuan, and dozens of banks, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Xinghua Bank, Huaxing Bank, Dalu Bank, Jincheng Bank, Yanye Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and Zhejiang Industrial Bank, will participate in the joint organization of the syndicate, allocating the loan amount to be undertaken. The borrowing silk factories include China Silk Industry Co., Ltd., Dali Silk Industry Co., Ltd., and other general small silk factories. All members of the Silk Industry Association have the right to borrow, but the association must provide proof and guarantee. It is reported that this syndicate loan will be made in the form of acceptance drafts, and the Central Bank of China has allowed the handling of this loan's actual discount.</p>

<h3>Director Matsudaira Discusses - Opening a Second Front - Germany Prepared and Unafraid</h3>
<p>Mr. Matsudaira, Director of Information at the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, met with reporters from various Chinese newspapers in the city at the Hua Mao Hotel at 3 PM yesterday (the 24th). Regarding the question of opening a second front, he expressed the following views: The reasons why Britain and the United States have not yet opened a second front are as follows:</p>
<p>The Soviet Union demands that the Curzon Line be the border between Russia and Poland. This line was proposed by the British Foreign Secretary during World War I, so Britain and the United States have no choice but to agree to the Soviet Union's request. However, the Soviet Union's attitude is strong, and Britain and the United States are somewhat fearful.</p>
<p>Recently, an Italian Communist who had resided in the Soviet Union for more than 20 years returned to his country and is active in the Badoglio government. As a result, Soviet Russia's influence in the Badoglio government has greatly increased.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia has two governments, one leaning towards Britain and the United States, and the other leaning towards the Soviet Union. Recently, the government leaning towards the Soviet Union has greatly increased in power as a result of the activities of its leader, Tito.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States have suffered military setbacks in India and Italy, and the situation in the Near East is becoming increasingly unstable. The British government's ability to open a second front is therefore greatly constrained. Germany is prepared to cope with the second front, and has dispatched a large army to the possible areas where the British might open a front, awaiting the enemy's forces. The German military is adept at land warfare, so the Germans are unafraid of the opening of a second front. U.S. Secretary of War Stimson recently warned the American people that the losses from the American opening of a second front would be incomparable to previous losses, and that the people must be fully prepared. British Prime Minister Churchill also gave a speech, forcefully stating that the overall air force remains as strong as ever, and that the second front will not appear in the shortest period.</p>
<h3>Post Office Issues New Fixed-Denomination Postal Money Orders</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has noted that the highest denomination of the various fixed-denomination postal money orders currently sold is only 100 yuan, which is insufficient to meet public demand. Therefore, it has specifically printed two new fixed-denomination postal money orders of 200 yuan and 300 yuan, which are distributed to various post offices for sale. The bureau's announcement is recorded below: "In order to meet public needs, two new fixed-denomination postal money orders of 200 yuan and 300 yuan have been printed and are being sold at the same time as the existing fixed-denomination postal money orders of 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, and 100 yuan. The remittance fee for these fixed-denomination postal money orders is lower than the remittance fee for ordinary postal money orders, and the procedures for application and payment are also simpler than for ordinary postal money orders. When applying for a postal money order, the remitter only needs to verbally state to the issuing clerk the amount of the postal money order and where it is to be remitted. After the issuing clerk hands the postal money order to the remitter, the remitter writes the name of the payee on the postal money order and then seals and mails it to the payee. If there is an airmail route in between, the letter containing the fixed-denomination postal money order can also be sent by airmail so that the payee can receive the remittance as soon as possible, without having to pay extra for airmail postage as when applying for an ordinary postal money order. After the payee receives the fixed-denomination postal money order, they only need to sign and stamp it on the back of the postal money order, and they can immediately go to the paying office to collect the remittance. Unlike the procedure for ordinary postal money orders, there is no need to wait for the paying office to receive the verification slip (i.e., the stub) sent by the issuing office before the remittance can be paid. For other details, please inquire at the post office.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jinhai Case - Appeals of All Defendants Announced - Sentences Reduced According to Amnesty Ordinance</h3>
<p>The Zhang Jinhai tragedy, since the trial by the former Special First and Second Court, resulted in Guo Shiyuan, Wang Shu, and Zhang Guiqing being sentenced to life imprisonment, and Zhu Songcheng and Li Hongda being sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. All defendants expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and appealed to the High Court, which held three hearings. Yesterday (the 24th) at 3 PM, the case was announced by the presiding judge of the High Court's Criminal Division, Du Fuyue, and Lu Fei Sheng. Police officer Chen Jingyi also attended the court to perform his duties. The presiding judge immediately announced that the original trial verdict was overturned. According to the National Government's Amnesty Ordinance, Wang Shu and Zhang Guiqing's sentences were reduced to twelve years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for ten years. Zhu Songcheng and Li Hongda's sentences were reduced to seven years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for five years. Guo Shiyuan's sentence was reduced to ten years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for eight years. If the defendants are not satisfied, they can appeal to the Supreme Court within ten days. After the verdict was announced, Guo Shiyuan was stubborn and continued to argue unreasonably with the court. The presiding judge ordered him that if he was not satisfied, he could appeal, but he should not say more. The court adjourned at around 3 o'clock, and the defendants were escorted back by the bailiffs.</p>

Since the trial implementation, the results have been very good. The branch bureau chief, Yao Rui, and others have also instilled spiritual education into the model police. Deputy Bureau Chief Su Tishi also visited the branch bureau to give a lecture, supplementing the spiritual education. At the same time, the gestures of traffic police directing traffic were also corrected, and all police officers were able to maintain a high level of morale.</p>

<h3>Insurance Companies Increase Capital - Procedures for Deposit and Withdrawal Established</h3>
<p>The Insurance Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in order to improve the organization of insurance companies, has been approved to handle the increase in capital of insurance companies.

After the company has fully paid the capital increase funds, it should submit a bank certificate to the bureau to verify the capital.

<h3>For the Dangerous Future of the Securities Market</h3>
<p>From the beginning of this year to the present, the market price of Chinese stocks has plummeted, and the trend is continuing. At the same time, commodity prices are still high, and the money market is extremely tight and interest rates are extremely high, so that the entire economic market, although not collapsing, has already formed a depression that has never been seen since the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The stock market is a decisive factor in the prosperity and decline of the modern market, which is beyond doubt. At the same time, stock investment and stock speculation are also decisive factors in whether or not a capital market can be established. Originally, the task of the stock market, especially during wartime, is to not only manage the funds of enterprises, but also to supply the industrial capital market. If the stock market is completely based on speculation, it is better to have no securities market.</p>
<p>Stock speculation is a phenomenon that should never exist in a normal capital market. Once this phenomenon occurs, stock prices will be in turmoil, and the securities market will never have a peaceful day. Shanghai is a society that is habitually speculative, with those above influencing those below, and deeply ingrained habits are difficult to change. Because of this, the Chinese Securities Exchange, which has the mission of establishing a Chinese capital market, should shoulder the responsibility of being a pillar in the middle stream, and should not follow the tide to survive unnecessarily. Otherwise, why do the elites in the industry advocate that the exchange should be run by the government? In short, since the securities market and the national industry are interdependent, the widespread and unreasonable surge and fall of securities should not be ignored. Furthermore, during the period of insane surges, it should not listen to the speculators who stir up trouble, and during the period of terrible declines, it should not allow the speculators to throw stones down the well. In addition, the inside and outside of the exchange mechanism must be completely sound, and it should not inherit the bad habits of the corrupt officialdom of the past, and only know how to be selfish and self-serving.

<h3>The Truth About Wartime Japan: 100 Million People United as One, Victory is Life</h3>
<p>The 100 Million Japanese People Under Harsh Wartime Conditions, Taking the Same Steps as the Government's Announced "Emergency Measures Outline," Their Fighting Spirit Against America and Britain is Intense. There is No Distinction Between Front and Rear Lines Now. I Spent Three Years in China, and Upon Returning to My Homeland, I Was Amazed by the Drastically Changed Rear-Line Decisive Battle Life. Every Citizen Overcomes a Life of Hardship and Scarcity, Determined to Stake Their Lives for the Survival of Their Ancestors, Marching Forward to Overthrow America and Britain. Because of This, Japan is Strong! I am Extremely Grateful. Although the Japanese Residents in Mainland China, Such as Shanghai and Beijing, are Taken Aback by the Soaring Prices, They Can Still Live a Life of Adequate Food and Clothing. Now That I Have Returned, I Will Describe a Glimpse of the Rear-Line Decisive Battle Life That I Have Seen and Experienced in the Imperial Capital, For the Overseas Chinese Gentlemen in China:</p>
<p>Visiting the Imperial Palace Before the Nijubashi Bridge</p>
<p>In Order to Visit the Imperial Residence. Coming from the Province. The Streetcar... Near Nijubashi, The Provinces... Even on Sundays, Special Representatives Often Come. Inside the Crowded Streetcars, More Than Half are Women, Dressed Simply and Neatly. They... Center... A Group... Also, No One Plays Games and No One Steals Things, Because "To Increase the Number of Airplanes, Electricity Must Be Conserved." Generally, Families Turn Off the Lights at 10 PM. Walking on the Gravel Road to the Nijubashi Bridge, Regardless of Rain or Snow, People Constantly Come to Pay Homage. The Conscripted Men Wearing Badges on Their Chests Especially Attract Attention. The Lush Green Pine Trees Stand Tall Against the Sky. We Look Up at Them and Cannot Help But Be Moved. We Have No Other Thoughts, We Only Feel Reverence in Our Hearts. The People Around Us Must Think the Same. Especially for the Brave Warriors About to Embark on Their Journeys, the Thought "Japan Will Surely Win, and Absolutely Will Not Be Defeated" Arises Spontaneously, Just Like in Front of the Yasukuni Shrine.</p>
<p>Observing the Lives of Citizens, When I Was Living in Shanghai, Many People Who Came Back From Japan Told Us About the Dire Electric Power Situation and the Shortage of Materials Such as Clothing During Wartime. It Seemed Like the Homeland Was in a Worrisome State. However, Upon Returning, I Found That Neither the Cities nor the Villages Were Lacking in Clothing. Clean Clothes. Someone Said That... Chinese Coolies. All Lies. Especially the Young People, They Adapt to the Situation, Wearing Long Pants, Working Actively. The Women Encouraging Labor Everywhere Contribute to Enhancing Combat Power. They Are Agile and Their Expressions Are Bright. For Everyday Meals, They Cook Millet, Soybeans, and Brown Rice Together. Having Just Returned From Shanghai and Being Accustomed to Eating Rationed White Rice, I Felt Uncomfortable at First, But Unconsciously I Got Used to It. The Ration is 2.3 合. At First, People Felt That It Was Not Enough, But Now They Don't Feel That Way Anymore. There Are Also Many People Who Adopt a Two-Meal-a-Day Diet. Also, For Single People Who Have Food Coupons, They Can Eat Out When Mealtime Comes.</p>
<p>A Single Life is Not at All Difficult</p>
<p>On March 5th, the "Emergency Measures Outline" Was Announced, All Waiting Rooms and High-Class Restaurants Partially Stopped Business. High-Class Cuisine Can No Longer Be Eaten. However, the Government Guarantees the Minimum Standard of Living. Single People with Dining-Out Tickets Cannot Eat Exquisite Food, But They Can Eat Their Fill. I Have a Friend Who Returned From the Southern Front Lines and Recently Got Married. He Said That the Rationed Amount is Enough. Originally, Japanese People Prefer Coarse Food and are Vegetarian. Moreover, There is Occasional Beef and Pork Rationed, So They Can Live a Comfortable Life.</p>
<p>Women and Children Diligently Work</p>
<p>When Walking on the Street, You Can See Young Ladies Helping Various Military Stations Carry Goods. Also, School Children Help Dig Shelters in Open Spaces. Because They Hold the Thorough Belief That Enemy Aircraft Will Not Wait For Us for Even a Moment. On the One Hand, The Girders of Bridges, The Iron Stairs of Department Stores, The Elevators in Western-Style Buildings, and Water Faucets Have All Been Dismantled, Providing A Lot of... The Iron Shutters of Stores Are Also Very Useful. Department Stores of Six or Seven Floors Have Reduced Their Merchandise to About Three or Four Floors, and The Things Sold Are Limited to Necessities of Wartime Life. Now, All Unmarried Women Up to the Age of Forty are Mobilized to Devote Themselves to Labor. A Certain Young Lady I Know, Just Graduated From Girls' School, and Hoped to Go Directly to a Military Factory. She Didn't Want to Be a Bank Clerk. Her Father and Mother Gladly Sent Her There.</p>
<p>Now, The 100 Million Japanese People Are United as One and Marching Forward. Because We Must Achieve Victory, We Must Overcome Any Suffering. (Former Shanghai Correspondent of the Mainichi Shimbun, Shimao Sei) (Translated by Xian From the March 22nd Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<p>Woolen Fabric Store Owner Treats People with Loyalty and Forgiveness, To the Attention of the Shen Bao Scholarship Office: Last September, My Wife Was Supporting My Daughter When Passing by Yicheng New Woolen Fabric Store at the Corner of Foch Road and Tongfu Road, She Carelessly Bumped Into the Bicycle Placed in Front of the Store, Shattering the Large Glass. The Store Owner Came Out, Not Only Did He Not Scold Her Harshly or Demand Compensation, But He Comforted My Wife in a Very Sincere and Friendly Manner, Telling Her Not to Panic. The Store Owner Reprimanded Any Staff Who Complained. When I Arrived, the Store Owner Only Asked to Send 100 Yuan in Savings to Your Newspaper as a Scholarship Fund, to Benefit Society. I Was Overjoyed and Thanked the Store Owner and Left. I Intended to Offer the Money Immediately, But Unexpectedly, the Situation Has Changed Endlessly in the Past Six Months.

<h3>Concerning the Shanghai-Ningbo Transportation</h3>
<p>— Nie Shi</p>
<p>Before the War, the Shanghai-Ningbo Transportation Was Known to Be Convenient. All Shipping Companies Competed to Attract Passengers. Currently, However,</p>
<p>The Number of Ships Has Decreased and the Sailing Time Has Been Extended</p>
<p>Before the War, There Were 7 or 8 Ships Running on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line; They Sailed Daily Without Interruption, Reaching the Destination Every Other Night, Without the Suffering of Long Stays and Waits. Currently, Only Two Ships Maintain the Route, But the Sailing Time Has Been Extended. This is Because the Ships are Often Stranded in Shanghai and Ningbo. Of Course, At This Time of Wartime Tension and Lack of Ships, We Often Extravagantly Hope for an Increase in Ships. However, We Hope That the Shipping Companies Will Consider the Method of Sailing Between the Two Places Every Day Before the War. If This Can Be Implemented, It Will Be Equivalent to Increasing the Number of Ships.</p>
<p>Tickets Are Difficult to Purchase and the Black Market is Skyrocketing</p>
<p>Because There is Not Enough for Everyone, a Black Market Has Emerged. The Black Market Ticket Prices Are at Least Five Times Higher Than the Prices Set by the Shipping Companies, and Up to Ten Times Higher. These Black Market Tickets Are All Sold by Various Travel Agencies (Or Black Market Brokers), While Those Who Purchase Tickets Directly From the Shipping Companies Often Fail to Obtain One, Even After Waiting for a Long Time. Here, We Cannot Help But Wonder Whether These Black Market Tickets Are Intentionally or Unintentionally Created by the Shipping Companies, and the Travel Agencies' Sale of Black Market Tickets is Also an Illegal Transaction. Moreover, Most of the Buyers of Black Market Tickets Are Small Merchants Who are Seeking Profit. They Only Seek to Buy Tickets and Do Not Care About the Price. However, Ordinary Travelers, Even if They are Willing to Pay a High Price, Cannot Obtain Black Market Tickets. Therefore, Cracking Down on Black Market Tickets is Essential to Solving This Problem. In Addition to Prohibiting Illegal Transactions by Travel Agencies, There is No Other Way Than to Sell Tickets Directly to Travelers by the Shipping Companies in a Fair Manner.</p>
<p>The Ship is Crowded and Hinders Hygiene. In Principle, One Ticket Should Correspond to One Berth. In Reality, Even if You Have a Ticket, You Still Need to Pay a Berth Fee to the Room Attendant (Varying From 200 to 300 Yuan). Even if You Have a Berth, You Definitely Cannot Stretch Out and Sleep Comfortably, Because There Are Passengers With Tickets But No Berths Around You. The Crowded Situation is Worse Than That on a Train. We Still Remember the Past Ships. Even if a Tragedy Does Not Occur, With Summer Approaching and Epidemics Prevalent, the Hindrance to Hygiene is Self-Evident.</p>
<p>It is Heard That the Shipping Company Authorities Have Adjusted the Prices of Ship Tickets (Starting on April...), About 200% to 300% Higher Than the Original Prices, in Order to Eliminate Black Market Tickets. If This Price Adjustment is Said to Improve the Transportation Situation, Then It is Too Optimistic. I Am Afraid That the Tide Will Rise and the Boat Will Rise, Only Causing Suffering to the Passengers. We Believe That the Fundamental Problem Lies in Improving the Ticket Sales Method. In Principle, It Can Be Based on the Following Points: Tickets Should Be Sold Directly by the Shipping Companies, Not Through Other People; Ship Tickets Should Be Sold to Legitimate Travelers (The Method Can Imitate the Railway Method, Limiting the Description and Weight of Passengers' Luggage); One Ticket Should Correspond to One Berth (The Company Should Train the Tea Houses, Not to Solicit Extortion, Not to Make Things Difficult for Passengers, and the Tea House's Small Account Can Be Added to the Ship Ticket). If the Above Points Can Be Realized, Then Our Ningbo Fellow Villagers Will Definitely Celebrate.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Iwata Yu Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>(This is Pearl Harbor!)</p>
<p>The Real People All Know That They Know This Point tacitly. However, When the Scenery of Pearl... Was Opened, The American Automobile Driver Soldiers Intentionally Increased Their Speed. Under the Constant Hindrance of Coconut Trees, Civilian Houses, Hills, etc., The Real People Focused on Looking Closely.</p>
<p>(There is the "Enterprise" Ship!)</p>
<p>On the Green Sea Surface, There Floats an Aircraft Carrier Like the Back of a Squid.</p>
<p>(There is also the "Indian Police" Ship!)</p>
<p>The Real People Remembered This Ship Type in Their Hearts. In Addition, There Are Two or Three Destroyers.</p>
<p>(Oh, It's the Scouting Fleet!)</p>
<p>Then He Paid More Attention to Watching, and Increased the Nervous Tension During the Martial Arts Competition.</p>
<p>After a While, He Was Very Happy. He Was So Happy That He Wanted to Hide Under the Floor of the Car-</p>
<p>(Ten)</p>
<p>On the Day of Departure, Iwate Invited Japanese Residents to Hold a Hometown Banquet. The Real People Also Led the Whole Family of the Doctor Who Took Care of Them in Many Ways, Visited Model Shops of Fish Rice and Dumplings, and Also Visited the Kendo Competition with War Prizes.</p>
<p>However, His Heart Was Very Incompatible With the Laughter Around Him. This Was Not Because of the Disgust Caused by the Happy and Vain Descendants. It Was Because the Feelings After Seeing Pearl Harbor Were Reflected on the Heart Board Again.</p>
<p>At Three O'Clock, the Hometown Banquet Was Over, and the Invited Guests Became the Senders, Building a Black Wall on the Shore.</p>
<p>"Hello, Hey! I Wish You a Safe Journey!"</p>
<p>The Doctor Still Spent a Lot of Money to Buy a Bunch of Expensive Fresh Flowers and Draped Them on the Shoulders of the Real People.</p>
<p>The Departure Time Came, and the Sound of the Bugle in the Ship Echoed Through the Clouds. The Candidates, Arranged in a Team on the Deck, Performed the Salute of Cheering on the Shore. After a While, the Fleet Departed for Hilo, Hawaii. The Doctor's Figure Waving His Hat on the Car Cover Gradually Became Smaller. When It Drove to the Outside of the Port, It Stopped Slightly to Let the Pilot Disembark. The Fishing Boats and Speedboats That Sent the Farewell, Flying Long Banners to Send, Gathered Around This Ship.</p>
<h3>Radio Fee Problem Reply from the Broadcasting Association</h3>
<p>Regarding the Letter From Mr. Yan Jie Xiong Published in the National Forum on April 18th, We Hereby Answer the Following:</p>
<p>Recently, When Collecting Wireless Radio Subscription Fees, the Situations Such As Loss of License and Change of Radio Owner Have Increased Significantly. Therefore, We Have Set Up an Inquiry Office to Speed Up the Handling of Procedures. This is Because the Subscription Fee System is Still in Its Initial Stage, and Listeners Are Still Unfamiliar With the Laws and Regulations. Therefore, the Inquiry Office Was Established. As for the Procedures and Fees for Replacing Lost Licenses, There Have Been Notices Posted. We Believe That There Will Be No Improper Behavior Such As Collecting Tips.</p>
<p>In Addition to the Internal Staff of This Department, There Are Also Field Staff. Most of Them Are Chinese. If, As Mr. Yan Said in His Letter, There Are Rumors of Collecting Tips, Then It Must Have Occurred Between Chinese Staff and Chinese Listeners. This is Due to Mutual Lack of Self-Respect, Which is Very Regrettable. Therefore, If There Are Any Requirements in Addition to the Prescribed Fees, Please Reject Them Immediately and Report...</p>
<p>In Addition, Regarding the Three Proposals Mentioned in Mr. Yan's Letter, The Answers Are As Follows:</p>
<p>It Seems Possible to Pay for Listening with a Temporary License, But the Number of the Temporary License is Different From the Number of the Formal License. If Temporary Licenses Are Used Exclusively, It Will Be Quite Difficult to Handle the Procedures. Therefore, It is Necessary to Apply for a Formal License Again With the Temporary License, But There is No Need for a Guarantor.</p>
<p>The Reason for Requesting the First Payment Slip From the Previous Period is Because When the Formal License is Lost, Or When the Month of Payment is Unknown, It Must Be Referenced. Therefore, It Must Be Properly Preserved.</p>
<p>Taking This Opportunity, I Would Like to Say Something Special. Please Pay Special Attention to Each of You, "Broadcasting is Set Up for All Listeners." Therefore, In Order to Clarify the Broadcasting Business, Please All Listeners Comply With Half of the Responsibilities So That There Are No More Unlicensed Radios and the Elimination of Bribery and Other Behaviors. We Hope That All Listeners Will Cooperate. Sincerely. Shanghai... Radio Station Listening Section.</p>
<p>Brown Rice is Better Than White Rice Perseverance Turns Weakness Into Strength Healthy Person</p>
<p>People Who Live in Shanghai Used to Eat White Rice. For Brown Rice, They Always Said It Was Rough and Difficult to Swallow. However, In Terms of Food, Often the Expensive and Delicious Foods Are Not the Most Nutritious for the Human Body. On the Contrary, If You Can Eat Green Vegetables, Tofu, and Brown Rice Every Day With Perseverance, It Will Be More Nourishing Than Any Delicacy. This Is Because In Brown Rice, All Kinds of Nutrients Are Basically Available. Healthy People Can Make Their Bodies Stronger, and People With Weak and Sick Bodies, If They Can Develop a Love for This Kind of Brown Rice and Often Maintain a Sweet Taste, Then Weak Bodies Can Regain Health. Ding, A Great Doctor in Our Country, Eats Brown Rice as the Only Good Way to Strengthen His Body and Personally Follows It. Therefore, Even Though He Is Now in His Old Age, His Body is Strong and His Spirit is Full, Which is Even More Than That of Ordinary Young People.</p>
<p>Based on My Experience, Since It Has Been Difficult and Expensive to Buy White Rice, I Have Changed to Eating Brown Rice. I Feel That My Body is Stronger Than Before. I Have Not Been Sick Once in One or Two Years. This Is Probably Thanks to Brown Rice. Therefore, I Do Not Secretly Covet It, But Make It Public to the World. Although It Is an Old Saying, It Is Still a Practical and Beneficial Method.</p>
<h3>Wooden Spinning Machine Experiment Report</h3>
<p>Reading Mr. Zhu Shuxun's "Advocating Native Yarn and Native Cloth Should Improve the Wooden Spinning Machine" on April 22nd, I Also Have the Same Feeling. Regarding Wooden Spinning Machines, Advertisements for Sale Are Often Seen in the Market, But The Results Have Not Met Expectations. I Have Worked Hard on Research for More Than a Year, and I Have Recently Made Some Progress. The Twist is About Equal to 16 Count. This Machine is Made Entirely of Hard Trees, and Materials Can Be Obtained Everywhere. Each Machine Has 60 Spindles. It Works 10 Hours a Day. Each Spindle Can Spin 1 Ounce of Yarn. Each Machine Can Spin 60 Ounces of Yarn. The Above Output is Still Managed by Inexperienced Female Workers. If The Training Is Purely Skilled, Then The Output Can Still Be Increased. Now, Spinning and Weaving Have Begun in the Countryside, Achieving the Goal of Spinning and Weaving Ourselves. Those Who Are Interested in Joint Research, Please Send a Letter to Liu Zhenyao, 439 Yuyao Road.</p>
<h3>Benefiting the Poor, Joyful Kindness Society Small Loan</h3>

Those Who Are Interested Can Go to That Store to Get Them, and There is Also a Gift of Specially Effective Goose Palm... Oil, But You Must Bring Your Own Storage Container. Respectfully Submitted by Dongtai Heji Pharmaceutical Company.</p>
<h3>New Puyutang Various Departments Equipment</h3>
<p>Nursing Home When People Reach Old Age and Have No Means of Support, They Are Taken in by the Hall. Those Who Are Physically Stronger Help With the Hall's Affairs. There is One Large Dormitory and One Dining Room. In the Dining Room, There Are Also Long Tables and Long Benches, Providing Them With a Place to Sit and Relax or Sew After Meals. The Number of People is 64 Men and 70 Women.</p>
<p>Poor Hospital There Are Two Male and Female Wards, Each of Which Can Accommodate 250 Patients. The Equipment is Perfect, Tidy, and Clean. Although It is Free, It Can Compete With the City's Charging Hospitals. In Terms of Numbers, There Are 84 Men and 69 Women.</p>
<p>Outpatient Department Every Time Medicine is Prescribed, About 200 People Come to Seek Treatment, All of Whom are Poor People in the South City. Those With More Serious Illnesses Are Also Given Free Hospital Stays.</p>
<p>Kitchen There is a Large Stove That is Two Zhang Long, and Six Large ... (Each of Which Can Serve 500 People). There are Three Meals a Day, Congee in the Morning, Rice at Noon, and Noodles in the Evening. They Eat Vegetarian Every Day, and Sometimes There is Meat. Recently, Because of the Soaring Rice Prices, There Has Been Some Panic About Not Having Enough Rice to Cook.</p>
<h3>Self-Police Pavilion Should Be Kept Clean Do Not Become a Beggar's Dormitory</h3>
<p>Since the Establishment of the Baojia System, Self-Police Posts Have Been Set Up at Self-Police Group Positions. Some Were Purchased Through Fundraising, and Some Were Donated. The Former Were More Common. In Terms of Quantity, There Was One Pavilion for Each Lianbao in the First Eight Districts. Because the Area Divided by the Lianbao in the First District Was Wider, The Number of Pavilions Was Also Increased. Each Lianbao Had Three, Four, or Five Pavilions. The Use of Setting Up Police Pavilions is to Provide a Place for Self-Police Group Members to Rest and Shield From the Wind and Sun. The Law is Very Good. However, Chinese People Lack Civic Virtue. They Arbitrarily Damage Public Property (Self... Pavilion). The Baojia Chief Sees This, But Doesn't Care at All and Doesn't Protect It At All. It Is As If This Is Not My Thing, Just a Formality. As a Result, Some of the Police Pavilions in Each District Are Incomplete. Some Have Broken Glass, Some Have Missing Windows, And Even the Seat Boards and Shelves Have Been Stolen. The Door Locks Are Not Wide and They Fly Away. Fortunately, The Police Pavilion Has Not Been Moved Away, Which is Considered Great Luck. People Temporarily Borrow a Night's Stay, (Every Crystal Constantly) In the Morning, When the Group Members Go to Their Posts, The Beggars Are Still Sound Asleep and Snoring. When They Are Driven Away With Sticks, They Start to Stagger Away. Over Time, White Wind Gathers in the Pavilion, and Those Who Are More Evil Even Defecate in It. The Foul Smell Touches the Nose and Makes People Want to Vomit. If Group Members Place Themselves in the Pavilion, It is Almost Impossible Not to Contract an Infectious Disease. Moreover, In The Future, The Days Will Be Warmer, And The Harm Will Be Even Greater. We Urgently Hope That the Responsible Personnel of Each Lianbao Will Clean It Up, Wash It Once a Week, And Repair the Broken Windows and Broken Glass as Soon as Possible, and Install Door Locks. Every Night, the Self-Police Group Members Responsible for the Last Drop Are Responsible for Locking Up, So That Beggars Cannot Enter, and Investigate Those Who Damage It and Punish Them With Several Times the Price of Repair, So That The Pavilion Can Maintain Its Due Cleanliness.
