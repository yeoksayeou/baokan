<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>寫在台菲海戰之後</h3>
<p>— 季仁</p>
<p>問：敵美在台灣菲律賓兩次海戰中，遭受到空前的損害，這是衆所周知的事實。但是，最近美國在雷伊泰島登陸的軍隊，逐漸增多；同時，海軍方面，也有機動部份游弋海面，大有蠶然思動之勢，試問這種行動對於戰局前途的影響如何？</p>
<p>答：敵美在台菲海戰中，主力機動部隊受到致命打擊，尼米茲艦隊殲滅過半，可謂開戰以來最大的損失。但是，美國在海戰之前，早抱犧牲決心，所以不惜策動其有力的海軍部隊，以與日本挑戰。敵美海軍的戰略，一方面準備引誘盟邦主力艦隊，與之一決雌雄，另一方面希望在菲律賓中部登陸以後，作爲中太平洋的據點，以圖遮斷日本與南太平洋之間的聯絡，此次美國海軍機動部隊所以不惜重大犧牲作此妄動，其目的亦即在此。可是美國的戰略如此，日本則不然。日本作戰的方略，是在如何消耗美國海軍，如何殲滅美國海軍，藉以把握最良的決戰機會。所以日本對於美國陸軍的行動，可以不加注視，其主要目標仍在海軍。過去大宮，塞班諸島的壯烈犧牲，並不是日本輕視數島的得失，乃是因爲數島之得失並不影導戰事大局，其根本原因還在殲滅美國海軍主力的時機未到。今美國在雷伊泰島登陸的陸軍部隊共增至七師團之多，在美國認爲是作戰有利，前途有望，其實美國的陸軍愈是增强，對於美國海軍愈爲不利，被殲滅的機會亦愈多。雷伊泰島登陸部隊增强到七師團後，必須要有大批的彈藥·武器·食糧·藥品等不斷的源源接濟，此時所需要的運轍船舶，將益爲增多。現在假定接濟一師團軍隊所需的船舶爲三十萬噸的話，則接濟七師團軍隊所需的船舶將至少爲二百萬噸以上。二百萬噸的運輸船隊，必須擁有大批的巡洋艦和驅逐艦來加以護衛，但巡洋艦與驅逐艦缺少戰鬥力，所以必須再加以主力艦和航空母艦增强戰鬥力，此時大批海軍部隊的出現菲律賓近海，對於美國是絕大危險，同時美國海軍愈是接近菲律賓本土，遭遇日本海空軍攻擊的機會也愈多，其危險性也愈大。上次美國海軍的慘敗，也是因爲這個緣故；今後的海面大戰，仍必繼續發生，不久的將來，又可看到美國艦隊的厄運了。</p>
<p>問：但是，美國軍隊的背後，還擁有强大的生產力，美國艦隊雖然遭受重大打擊，但是它仍能利用强大的生產能力，來與日本繼續作戰的，尊意以爲如何？</p>
<p>答：美國的全國生產力，的確不可輕視，但是，今日的戰爭，並不單是物資的戰爭，也不單是數量的戰爭，還有最重要最不可缺的主要原動力，乃是精神要素。敵美人民因薰陶於自由享樂的環境之中，對於個人的利害特別重視，所以在戰塲上，往往祇能消耗其大量武器和彈藥，而視其一已之生，有如泰山之重；而日本國民一向以刻苦耐勞聞世，惟其能刻苦，所以能輕視個人的生命，也惟其能耐勞，所以能替國家擔任興亡的重任。此次台菲海戰中，日本航空特別攻擊隊所以能以驚天地泣鬼神的壯烈「肉彈」戰法，與美國艦隊同歸於盡，終能收獲了龐大戰果，確立絕對不敗的態勢，其原因應完全歸諸日本國民「捨己爲國」的精神。所以我說：精神爲上，物質次之。</p>
<p>問：不過，來日方長，戰爭的前途將如何發展？戰爭的趨勢是否必對日本有利？</p>
<p>答：偉大的事業決不成於一朝，同樣，最後的光榮是須在艱苦萬端之中求來的。祇有堅忍不拔百折不撓的精神，纔是事業的唯一要素。長期教爭途中中，勝固不足驕，敗亦不必餒，唯有在最後的一次決戰中，勝敗方能自明。我們可以預料，美國艦隊將再興師來犯，將來不論在菲律賓，台灣，及其他海面，必再發生較此次海戰更大規模更爲激烈的海戰。不過，敵美艦隊離根據地愈遠，作戰上的不利愈甚，對於日本也更爲有利。將來日美海戰雖然不致在對馬海峽發生，但我們可斷定敵美艦隊必將與波羅的海艦隊同樣的遭受到悲慘的命運。</p>

<h3>桂日軍佔要衝　縮小包團圈</h3>
<p>華南前綫十八日中央社電　渝軍自喪失挂林柳州後，已潰不成軍，續向西南敗走中。一部日軍現仍追擊渝軍，到處展開包圍殲滅戰。爰日軍自進佔來賓遷江中間地區後，排除武江北岸渝軍第百五十六師之頑强抵抗，並冒渝美空軍之空襲，於十一日强行渡過武江，自對岸旬安圩附近繼續北進。十三日晨遂佔領要衝白見村，並掃蕩附近逾軍。此外佔領遷江之其他一部日軍，亦繼續北進，遮斷渝軍退路，刻正縮小包圍圈中。</p>
<h3>雷伊泰陸戰熾烈　日軍確保各高地　連日強襲敵船團及機塲</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十八日中央社電　雷伊泰島日陸軍之攻擊，更形熾烈，背雷伊泰島中央山脈塔加米之日軍，對敵第九十六師之主力，更出以突擊，實施夜襲，予敵電以重創，使之陷於大亂，現各高地仍爲日軍確保中。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地十八日中央社電　日航空部隊刻仍連日强襲雷伊泰灣敵船團及敵機塲，十五·六兩日拂曉，更轟炸雷伊泰灣敵輸送船團及雷伊泰島敵陸上設施及機塲等，收獲戰果計炸毀敵中型運輸船一艘，並使塔克羅班機塲數處及該市市街地區數處發生爆炸，起火焚燒。</p>
<h3>被俘敵美空軍　述襲京經過</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　俘虜之敵美航空員，現已護送來京，記者特往走訪其中之一，談話如次：（問）請略述此次出征時之情形。（答）十一月九日正午，吾等自印度基地出發，於是日下午七時，飛抵成都附近，十一日上午二時，再行出發轟炸日本。出發後經過相當時間，因氣候惡劣，遂改變原定行動，轟炸南京。（問）出發時隊長曾有訓示否？（答）並無明顯之訓示，因吾等皆爲天主敎徒，故出發前，全體集合一處，作祈禱後，即領取地圖及航空照片，準備出發。（問）到達南京上空時之狀况如何？（答）吾等皆由指導官引導，並不知何處爲南京，但不久日軍高射砲似已開始射擊飛機之前後左右，前後皆是砲彈之炸裂。（問）B29。型機前宣傳爲絕對不落者，究竟有何優點？（答）以前對此尚相當信任，但最近在北九洲曾被擊落多架，吾等對於其性能已有疑問。（問）中彈時之狀况如何？（答）如今想起宛如夢境，蓋吾開　投彈後，炸彈才離飛機，即感到猛烈之推動，最初以爲係所投下炸彈之爆炸聲，其後始知判斷錯誤。原來係日軍之高射砲彈，擊中所投下之炸彈，因而爆烈所致，此誠爲一奇蹟。其後不久，吾等由右側面窗口向外看，即見右翼之一座引擎已經起火，當即與他機連絡，吿知本機發生火災。其後不久，右翼之兩座引擎停止活動，機身向右傾斜，火勢更烈，繼之左冀亦復起火燃燒，遍及全機，飛機全身分離。此時傳聲管恐亦發生障碍，故未聞以降落傘降落之命令。死之命運迫近吾等，吾等乃排除一切障碍，隨一秒一秒之時間，以降落傘降下，自降落傘張開後，至被日軍俘虜，其情形已記淸楚，現雖然被俘，較歸去爲佳。（問）汝等之轟炸幾屬盲炸，多數無辜中國市民無辜犧牲，汝等前言吾等爲天主敎徒，在出發前皆作祈禱，所　天主敎徒，對於盲炸殺害無罪者，有何感想？（答）此純屬不得已而爲之，吾等奉令轟炸，不知其結果，中國平民之被炸死，吾等皆不得已，此外又有何言。</p>
<h3>東南亞空軍司令　麥羅萊乘機失踪　韋勒中將任反軸心副總司令</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十八日中央社電　德國社訊，據倫敦消息，英高級指揮部十七日正式公布，空軍元帥麥羅萊爵士夫婦，十五月十四日乘飛機離英赴東南亞洲，就東南亞空軍總司令之新職，但該機並未能飛抵目的地，麥羅萊之踪跡不明。</p>

<h3>蘇聯外交　六項原則</h3>

<h3>傾舉六軍全力　總攻齊格斐綫　激戰在三焦點進行中</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　艾森霍華十六日已將最後豫備兵力之美第九軍派赴戰綫，德方預料之反成爲事實，於由荷蘭海岸達瑞士國境蜿蜒七百公里之戰綫，終已展開大攻防戰。現全戰綫之焦點，係爲梅茲·亞琛·文羅三地區，綜觀戰局概況如次：（一）法軍雖自瑞士國境以薩爾勃羅根爲目標開始攻擊，然其目的係在經由貝爾福·牟魯斯於瑞士之猶拉與瓦鳩中間，抵達萊因河，以掩護英軍主力及攻擊西綫中央之德軍，此事已甚明顯美第七軍與法軍並行對瓦　山脈直接開始攻擊。（一）巴頓指揮下之美第三軍雖對梅茲作集中攻擊，但其目標係在集結超重兵器，以突破德軍防衛綫，經薩爾抵達瑪因河口，該軍北翼更集結繩大兵力，（一）英第二軍與美軍攻勢緊密連擊，於文羅地區開始攻勢，於最北冀配有加拿大軍。由上述之淸勢觀之，艾森霍華對齊格斐防綫之攻擊，已傾其所有之六軍全部力量，然反軸心軍絕難達成所期目的，蓋決定戰局上最大因素之時間已見遲晚矣。</p>

<p>費神同千架猛烈轟炸</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　海通社訊：美第九軍在亞琛區之新攻勢，乃藉飛行氣候轉佳而發動。此次進攻先用千餘架轟炸機爲前導，然後由步兵與坦克車展開進攻。秋季氣候常有利於反軸心軍，對德守軍則不利，且本年大陸上多雲霧，故德機起飛與降落故感不易，而英倫三島則氣候淸朗，故英機能常至歐陸。</p>
<h3>歐洲局勢　將有新發展　羅斯福對記者闡明戰況</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據華盛頓電：羅斯福總統昨日會見新聞記者時，延長會談時間至一時半以上，其原因爲說明關於歐洲戰綫新軍事行動情形。美政界財界觀測，歐洲方面於最近或引起重大新事態。</p>

<h3>神風特別攻擊隊　菲島洋面建立奇功　敵美太平洋艦隊化爲藻屑</h3>
<p>使驕傲的敵美艦隊化爲太平洋藻層的日子，終於來了。十月二十五日，日本海軍對菲島東方海面的敵美殘存艦隊主力，突然開始海空一體的猛攻。早就在心中期待這樣的一天，祈神拜佛，盼望它快些到來，現在果然來了。此日的感慨興奮，誰能忘記呢？在數日以前，睥睨大空，浩嘆沒有敵機的海軍飛行隊員們，現在却駕駛如雲似霞的精銳機，勇躍前往滅敵了。</p>
<p>這一天，菲律賓一帶的天氣，恰在久雨之後放晴。今日是可以實行攻擊了。日以繼夜地集結起來的友軍飛機，在總攻擊即將揭幕以前，經整備人員不休不眠的努力，一切準備都巳完畢。擊滅敵軍的第一彈，由海軍航空部隊的先制攻擊而射了出去。目標是敵方的航空母艦羣。侵入雷伊泰灣，在塔克羅班附近強行登陸的敵軍，爲了掩護這支上陸的軍隊，在菲島建立強力橋頭堡，他們正動員了殘存艦隊的全力。解決了這方面敵軍的空軍之後，始可在我方的制空權下，充分發揮艦隊的威力，所以菲島基地海軍航空部隊所負的任務，委實重大。一待總攻擊的命令下來，便機聲隆隆地相繼飛離基地。</p>
<p>海軍航空除員都抱着必死的決心。其中神風特別攻擊隊尤爲日本海軍的精華，這護國神鷲之名，應該永遠銘記。他們以肉彈進攻的無畏精神連人帶機一同撞向敵方航空母艦。一度飛出基地，發見敵美機動部隊時，他們便不再歸來了。這種決死的特別攻擊隊，正是前綫航空部隊的主軸，是爲了負起祖國存亡重任而組織成功的，他們是久經訓練的空中敢死隊。</p>
<p>「站在全體國民的先頭而出征，永久保衛祖國光榮歷史的，就是咱們。帝國海軍的傳統，今日非發揮一下不可。」抱着如此信念的海軍靑年飛行員，全身沸騰着熱血。親蒞神風特別攻擊隊基地的指揮官，深深爲靑年飛行員的悲壯心情所感動，聲淚俱下地致訓詞時，靑年壯士們連眉毛也不動一動。</p>
<p>鎭靜如常</p>
<p>二十五日，總攻擊的時機已到。特別攻擊隊的靑年勇士們，仰觀放晴的太空輕快地說這：</p>
<p>「今日一定幹啦！」</p>
<p>「多多拜託！」一邊說，一邊熱烈地握握整備員的手。這裏那裏，到處都有歡聲。過後，祗見大家互相默默然舉手致敬。</p>
<p>在這出發作敢死攻擊的當兒，不料大家都有這種靜默的態度，就因爲在遙遠的故國，有年老的父母，也有今春剛結婚的嬌妻。那末，這批靑年飛行員們，現在心中是在想些什麼呢？在隆隆的機聲裏，記者凝視着爬進愛機去的靑年勇士，他們口角緊閉，可以看出斷然的決心。臉上且浮着寗靜的微笑。淡淡然，照常動作。一待成爲機上人時，海軍航空隊員的頭腦中，除出擊沈敵人航空母艦的念頭以外，便什麼也沒有了。</p>
<p>焦急待捷</p>
<p>飛機的引擎聲爽脆地轟隆着。飛機沿着滑走路，平穩地飛起，一架又一架。壯士們有些揮着手向地上人員告別，有些一心一意操縱着座機。他們全體在基地上空組成編隊。這支神風特別攻擊隊的第一次攻擊隊，於是消失於碧空的那方。之後，已過了幾個鐘頭。如果沒有發見敵人，那末已是應該歸敵軍航空母艦了。於是基地上頓時嘈雜起來。</p>
<p>發見了之後，又將怎樣呢？痛快地幹下了，那當然最好，萬一受阻於敵方的防禦砲火，不能命中航空母艦，那末年靑壯的死不是太可惜了嗎？這時大家不免憂悉起來了。</p>
<p>任務完成</p>
<p>可是，這天下午，却從別的基地傳來了友軍飛機目擊的報告，情形是這樣的：</p>
<p>「第一次特別攻擊隊，在斯魯安到〇〇度〇〇　的海面，發見敵美機動部隊，二機侖中航空母艦，擊沈；一機侖中航空母艦，使之起火（敵方航空母艦陷於不能航行）；一機命中巡洋艦，擊沈。」</p>
<p>啊，多悲壯！這不是炸彈侖中了敵艦，而是連人帶機侖中了敵艦。第一决特別攻擊隊的任務，已經完成。接到此大戰果的報告時，司令祗是瞑目說道：</p>
<p>「現在，年輕的隊員們是成爲神了。我一直是如此想的。」</p>
<p>這樣，敵美艦隊是相繼化爲大平洋的藻層了。這就是因爲驕敵美軍將日本海軍的實力估計太低，同時又輕視盡忠報國的至誠如燃的海軍航空部隊的精神的原故。（吉田報道班員）（譯自十月三十日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>現代神風</h3>
<p>在菲島東方海面的捷報相繼傳來的二十五日傍晚，最前綫基地司令部接到這樣一個無綫電報：</p>
<p>「敷島隊戰果：空母一艘，一機侖中擊沈；空母一艘，一機侖中起火，航行停止；巡洋艦一艘，一機命中擊沈。」</p>
<p>噫，這個戰果！這正是日本海軍神風特別攻擊隊第一次攻擊隊敷島隊險員以肉體和愛機代替炸彈而獲得的崇高的戰果的第一報！此後，第二次，第三次各神風隊的捷音，將接踵而至。神風特別攻擊隊，多麼崇高的名稱！這是駕駛具有特別爆炸裝置的飛機，抱着必死之心去實行轟炸的。在航空戰史上，可說是空前的創舉。這是祗有日本的航空隊才能做到的空中敢死攻擊。而且，神風特別攻擊隊的壯士，以年輕的海軍航空隊長爲中心，年耙都很輕。至其任務，正如其名所示，在這以國家典亡打賭的菲島洋面海戰中，用敢死肉搏的制先攻擊，捲起了勝利的神風（譯者按：一二八〇年五月元軍大舉攻日，閏七月海上突起颶風，元軍兵船幾乎完全覆沒，故日本史上有神風之說。）所以神風特攻隊的各攻擊隊，作爲各艦載轟炸隊的先鋒，相繼一去不歸地從基地出發。以下便是記者在司令部所在的基地上目覩的神風特別攻擊隊自誕生直到出擊的情形。</p>
<p>敢死精神</p>
<p>敵軍開始在菲律賓羣島中部雷伊泰島登陸的二十日，基地上自拂曉起，便充滿了殺氣。「來了嗎一，驕敵！」一死滅敵的時機已經到來，每一個「海鷲」的眼，都射出殲敵的光芒，露出一死報國的決心。他們是爲了這樣的一天而編成的，他們一直猛烈調練，現在，發揮他們威力的日子，終於來啦！基地上不期面然地湧起了萬歲萬歲的歡呼。精選出來的攻擊隊勇士，都是十九歲到二十四歲的有經騐的靑年戰士。這排空中敢死隊，分爲第一次攻擊隊，第二次攻擊隊及第三次攻擊隊等數班，整列終了。上午十時，來自某基地的司令長官〇〇中將，在本部前面召集全體特別攻擊隊隊員，對他們的出陣作激勵和感謝的訓話。</p>
<p>「國家的興亡，繫於此時此戰，並在各位肩上！這次太平洋大決戰的勝利的神風，將由各位的肉彈捲起來。爲了大元帥陛下，爲了國家，本司令長官希望各位默身盡忠！」</p>
<p>靑年飛行員的眼　，澄如秋水，凝視着〇〇中將。旁邊，是　着拳的Y司令和K副長。中將的聲關和身體，微微抖動，他繼續說道：</p>
<p>「各位唯一的造憾，想必是肉搏攻擊敵艦隊以後，不能知道百己所建的戰勳吧。但是，各位的戰鬥，直接掩護你們的友機必定看淸了報告長官。長官必定將戰果報告各位之前，並奏上大元帥陛下。所以不必引以爲憾。」</p>
<p>激勵終了，長官和特別攻擊隊的靑年壯士熱烈地握手。</p>
<p>之後，「海上行」和「預科練之歌」的齊唱聲，便轟天震地價響了起來。在殺氣和撼奮之中，神風特別攻擊隊遂以身經百戰的海軍航空隊長關大尉爲隊長而誕生了。</p>
<p>風蕭蕭兮</p>
<p>獻身的時機來了。第一次攻擊隊「數島隊」終於出動攻擊。二十五日黎明，濡染朝露的靜寂基地上，整備員漏夜整備起來的神風攻擊機，發出隆隆的轟音。指揮所內，攤着地圖，副長仔細告訴攻擊隊的勇士說：</p>
<p>「攻擊目標是敵方航空母艦，拚掩時須對準航空母艦的弱點。</p>
<p>以後，第一次攻擊隊敷島隊長關大尉大聲對部下道：</p>
<p>「咱們不是轟炸隊，是炸彈。隨咱來吧！」</p>
<p>關隊長雙目烱烱，射出決死的光芒。各個敢死飛行員的瞳孔，也透出無畏的神光。已是出擊的時候了。頭上包着純折布帛的敢死隊靑年隊員，十足表現出他們的決心，連降落傘也不帶，相繼　登有特別爆炸裝置的飛機。機聲隆然，隊長機首先起飛，接着二號機三號機也相爾而起，基地上面湧起一陣廖烟。機上人揮着手，作最後的告別。壯士一去不復返，神風數島隊浩浩蕩蕩飛離基地；從今以後，他們不再歸來了。</p>
<p>右肘負傷的Y司令，扶着松葉杖，倚在從兵身上，親臨歡送部下靑年勇士出發，副長也仰首注視敷島隊，不住揮動着防署帽，直到敷島隊的機影，深深沒入南方的天際。（藤野報道班員）（譯自十月三十日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>雷伊泰島形勢圖</h3>
<p>敵美在雷伊泰島登陸已一月，環繞該島之陸海空戰鬥，日益熾烈。陸地方面日軍與敵兵在密林中展開白刃戰。日空軍猛炸巴魯方面敵機塲。薩馬島東方海面，敵船團受重損，奧莫克方面敵軍亦受重創。</p>

<h3>別離前夕</h3>
<p>— 明烟</p>
<p>爲了生活，我得携了行囊投奔他鄉。</p>
<p>車票買在决最，照理，當晚該是向親友們辭行的一個機會，要他們知道，我已經開始自立，用自己的力量去謀獨立生存，誰說一個女孩子除了嫁人就沒路可走！可是沒有，一個親戚一個朋友也沒去說一聲，即使說了又怎樣？大不了面子上做出些別離的惆悵，招呼聲：「去了來信呀！」「什麼時候再回來呢？」虛僞而淡漠的口頭關心，在他們算人情做到，反過來，自己倒悽楚地悲哀起來，顯然的，這地方沒有一個眞眞關懷或牽掛我的人！</p>
<p>這一晚，我顯得多麼孤冷，多麼冷落！沒有一個人影來探望我一下。不怪，　知道你不聲不響就要走呢，也沒有一個人替我餞行。早上餘下的冷飯我還得動手熱了才能吃，然而睬着牆角冰凉的炭爐，我祗發怔：那口小鍋早就還了底下的房東太太。常言道：「冷茶冷飯好吃，冷言熱語難受。」管他的！吃，揣起來，爬進這麽一口，沒有菜？案上有本食譜，裏面有鮮蝦燒豆腐，栗子紅燜肉，炸麵巾…就着旁邊一碟醃蘿蔔絲，嚥了一口，又一口。</p>
<p>穿過咽喉，溜下去像一塊冰團，伴和的蘿蔔絲，反噎出一股酸味，酸中夾點兒凉，還不算苦！心中的感覺也是冷冷的，不過冷得很平靜，這平靜直到外面響起一陣叩門聲，這才捲起了漩渦，然而僅管叩門聲騷動了寂靜的空氣，我還沒忘記藏起了碗碟，抹抹嘴唇，裝出沒吃過冷飯的樣子。</p>
<p>進來的人使我驚異，她拎着一個提盒，一面似責備而又慈祥的說：</p>
<p>「明兒要走了，別人不打招呼，怎麼連外婆也不理會一聲！唉！年靑人做事莽撞，要不是早上我來了，你不在屋裏，看你收拾好的箱囊，我還不知道眞的明天就動身啦……</p>
<p>我接過了她手中的提盒，微笑而無言，心下也譴責着自己做事糊塗。</p>
<p>盒蓋掀去，噴出一股杳甜的熱氣，我喜的跳起來拉着外婆的手，她悽楚地笑着望我：</p>
<p>「吃罷！熱着呢，就這麼一去，又不知那天回來了……」是的，「就這麼一去，又不知那天回來了……」這是外祖母的話，這句話很熟習，我不止聽見這一次，她的女兒和她的兒子，她好像都對他們這樣說過，她送走了她的女兒到另一個世界，又放走了兩個兒子遠去塞邊，她常對我說：王三姐守丈夫（薛平貴）一十八年，她守兒子究竟要等到那天？想到了兒子，她就老淚縱橫呌我替她寫信，信上的話像很多，但是歸根結底無非是呌他們快回來，她想他們，她想，他們也應該想着她。封好了信口，她押了我走向郵局，親眼看着它投進信箱，其實這封信根本就沒去處，它就不知落在那個陌生人手裏撕掉算數，這是我心裏的話，但又從來沒有吐露的膽量。</p>
<p>如今又將送走她惟一的孫女，沒有多大的悲哀；僅是無聲的嘆息……。</p>
<p>她望着那見了空氣，凍結得起了皺紋的　餅呌我多吃些，恨不得全塞進了我的肚子。</p>
<p>幽黯的燈光下，對面對坐着這兩個孤獨的人，一老一小，天地似乎造下道兩個人像是有意搬弄使我們巧合在一起，你憐憫着我，我關心着你。</p>
<p>在濛濛的曉蓩中，我們開始要分手了，臨上車她還緊緊地叮囑：「來信啊」！我際然地點點頭，望着她顫動的嘴唇却沒有聽見半句成語……</p>
<p>街燈在光明的朝晨由黯淡漸次熄滅，掉過頭來，前面已是蔚藍的長空和廣漠的原野，不知何時，軍已行將百里之外了。</p>

<p>原來他父親在私自盤算之下，覺得在此時此地，乘脚踏車無諭如何要比乘電車方便得多，且就經濟原理與精神方面來講，零碎支付車錢與時時在車中受人擁擠或受人么喝，都是比較合算的，有心想給早出晚歸的長女濤聲，也買一輛脚踏車，一時又凑不出許多錢來，於是轉念間，便把自已的一輛全新的脚踏車賣了，改買了一輛半新的。把那多餘的錢便交給濤聲，儘這一筆錢的量，囑她自己去物色和購置。父親的寵愛是偉大的。</p>
<p>懷着感激和崇敬的心，加以莫可言宣的快樂，濤聲開始四處向朋友們訊託，尋求一輛相當的脚踏車。二個星期之後，終於由同事某君的介紹而認識了一位石先生，更由石先生的熱心指導，總算講定了一輛所謂一來路貨」的舊車子。然而舊雖則舊了，卻是很中用的。有一天，九月的野菊花，醉吻着斜陽，是一個明朗的近黃昏。石先生來拜訪濤聲了了</p>
<p>石先生，今朝我出去的時候，闖了禍。車子有點不對了，踏起來老是嘰哩咖啦地響，正預備出去修車呢！」</p>
<p>大凡第一次見面，是因歌唱而相識的，以後見面時，總喜歡談些歌唱的事，同樣濤聲一見石先生時，關於脚踏車的話，便不由思索地脫口而出。</p>
<p>「身子沒有摔痛嗎？是怎麼一回事呢？」石先生問。</p>
<p>「也是我自己騎得太快了，但也不能全怪我。車子經過高山路口的時候，那裏正有一堆等電車的人，人數總在三五十以上，我這樣一路撳着鈴踏過去，驀地橫刺裏擠出一個男人來，麻木不仁地站在路中，還作着「電車來了沒有？」的姿勢。我車輸一時收煞不住，又怕撞傷了那人，就這樣我把自己摔在電車軌道上了。」濤聲是位天眞淘氣的姑娘，邊說邊做着動作。旣已約略地說過了，眉宇間還留着懊惱的嘆息。</p>
<p>「讓我把車子帶回去替您修理一下吧。——您不相信我能修得好嗎？」石先生說，說時並做了一個禮貌上應有的微笑。濤聲心裏很不願讓他拿去修，因如修好了豈不欠下人家一份人情，修不好時，可不能怨怪人家，反而徒然躭擱了時間。然而話讓他說在頭裏了，不給他修時，顯得不相信他能修得好，反而使人立刻下不了台。只好仍把車子交了給他。</p>
<p>業餘的練習員，究竟不是專門的技術工作者。因爲車身機件配置的一脫節，濤聲又一次摔了一交，險些沒讓過往的大卡過往的大卡</p>
<p>濤聲在懊喪之餘，免不得要怨到石先生身上</p>
<p>而在石先生呢，內心的歡仄，喚起了十倍的殷勤，愈加巴結起來。</p>
<p>一日，濤聲推車從辦事處出來，在門口碰見石先生，右先生也是騎車的，一路伴送她回家，途中再三邀她喝茶休息，經不得濤聲再四推辭。便又東拉西扯地想出些話來說。說話好比寫文章，說得好，頭頭是道，簡潔中肯；說得不好，亂七八糟，尤其不能吸引人的注意，說到後來，索性連自己也說糊塗啦，於是紅燈綠燈也不看了，前面旁邊有沒有車子也不管了……</p>
<p>「喀嚓……」——一輛脚踏車撞在巡警的站石上了，車身終於馬臥在柏油路上，車主蛙撲在地。一輛三輸車由身邊疾馳而過，帶去了他手臂上的一片皮。身後的一輛黃包車不可責備地從脚踏車上拉了過去。</p>
<p>俗語說：「有一，有二，必有三！」濤聲連摔過二交，這一次連她自己也以爲必是可要輸着她來闖禍了。</p>
<p>然而，事實上，受到損傷的卻是石先生，不是她。這次，石先生的足踝骨是折斷了！</p>
<p>濤聲回到家裏，半天不言語，後來，才愼重其事地向他的父親說道：「父親，我們以後騎車的時候，千萬不要騎得太快，尤其不要在車子上和人談天，並且時時應該檢查自己的車子有沒有任何毛病，否則太危險了。馬路　的似虎口。」</p>
<p>父親點着頭。</p>
<p>從此，濤聲是謹愼而又小心了。然而，誰敢說馬路上已沒有粗心大意的騎車人！</p>

<h3>申報杯籃球聯賽　甲乙兩組最近形勢</h3>
<p>申報盃籃球聯賽，甲乙兩組，均已有眉目。停賽一週後，自今日起照常舉行。茲將甲組及乙組各部，各作一最近形勢觀，隊員及球迷可按圖索驥。</p>
<p>甲組　華聯藥廠領　羣雄</p>
<p>華聯藥廠已六戰六勝，保持不敗紀錄者，碩果僅存，對於錦標自屬呼聲最高。其次常以中北汕隊僅敗一次，追隨於後。大華華南雖各敗二次，尚可力爭上游。明星仁餘同仁華影將在名次上爭先後。V除已屢戰屢北，殿單一席，恐亦非該隊莫屬。附形勢表：</p>
<p>乙一部　仁餘驚聲　半斤八兩</p>
<p>乙一部仁餘鷺聲實力相埒，目下均連戰皆捷。在晨友盃中兩隊亦曾相逢，鷺聲獲勝甚多。此賽中仁餘更加强實力，誓必報此一箭之仇，而奪得部冠軍也。誠孚極爲振作，中行梵江，力有不逮耳。</p>
<p>乙二部　大華中儲　胖隊並峙</p>
<p>此部之胖隊與中儲，均三戰三勝。與大華乙之二戰二勝，並峙進行。究實力似以大華較勝，但胖隊諸將，經騐豐富，屆時或能有妙策破敵，故二部必爲上列二隊所必爭，中儲亦爲銀錢業中所負盛名者。故此部最爲精彩，競爭最烈。</p>
<p>乙三部　飛隊燦爛靑協有爲</p>
<p>三部飛隊已四戰四勝，如此自屬前途燦爛，唯靑協以出塲次數較少，亦保持不敗紀錄。而靑協最近之成績，極見進境，曾獲其他乙組聯賽錦標，日後戴能脫穎而上，壓倒飛隊。飛鴻尚未有勝績，暫居未座。</p>
<p>乙四部　慕爾全勝汕隊緊隨</p>
<p>汕隊遞承甲組之作風，故演出殊稱佳妙。在乙組隊中，確爲難得之隊伍。目下尙出戰二次，故應列在慕爾四戰四勝之後。唯來日汕隊與慕爾相遇，後者恐難挫其鋒。論之，常以汕隊爲最具希望，其次慕爾隊，炸隊庸碌，難期發展，夏風尚有可爲。</p>
<p>乙五部　晨友藍鶴立鷄羣</p>
<p>五部各隊實力最爲平均，如振源雖連負二次，均爲些微相差。鐵夫亦不幸慘敗一次，然前途均仍具希望。晨友藍目下鶴立雞羣，以後暗礁極多，亦不可不謹情從事。該隊有王立鐸王存瑞等老將，自易多發展。玲瓏乃爲實力最弱者。</p>
<p>乙六部　中北伶友完軍必爭</p>
<p>此部中有殿軍希望者，當爲强師與間益。但查强師爲純粹一學校中之教職員所組織，尤爲滬上第一。球藝雖較差，此點亦值得一提也。致本部之領袖，大致爲中北。蓋有甲組隊員所薰陶，况穆時彥等身手不凡，日後壓倒伶友，攫奪首席，有厚望焉。</p>
<p>綜觀乙組，尚未屆緊張關頭，今日起又將展開戰事，嗣後均爲日趨外化之鏡頭。預測各路小英雄，必枕戈待旦，以期奪得分部冠軍。而產生分部冠軍以後，尚須決奪總冠軍，則以六組中之精銳對壘，未必較甲組賽爲遜色。且可由此中獲得不少後起之秀。</p>
<p>停賽一週今日續賽</p>
<p>今日起申報盃，照例繼續舉行，秩序照舊，唯下週一三五之比賽，即爲本週停賽之三天補上，以後秩序，除星期日外，依此類推。致下週甲組賽極多精彩節目，週一大華明星亦屬一塲好戲。蓋後者匠勤於練習，球藝日見進境，大華必受一番威脅。</p>
<p>華聯汕隊週三決鬥</p>
<p>週三十二日）華聯汕隊之戰，已爲球球迷所集中談話資料，有謂華聯穏勝，亦有謂汕隊自慘敗於華南後，臥薪嘗膽，此番必誓師應廠。且聞汕隊近日來積極約各隊作友誼資，並在俱樂部討論戰策，可見雄心不小也。華聯自始至終，一貫精神，規定練習，屈時如有其神機妙算。球迷是日應早去，以免向隅，蓋塲地狹小，限制所致，不得不爾。</p>
<p>週五甲組兩幕好戲</p>
<p>週五甲組一塲爲華影與明星，前者係電影明星，後者之明星，乃明星香水廠仝人所組織，故以此名。兩明星皆有卯上之成績，唯兩隊最近之缺點，亦同爲人馬難齊。但此戰有關名次甚大，必各盡心鬥法。另幕爲中北對大華，又可轟動一時。蓋中北之演出，有大量觀衆所信仰，而大華究不失爲上乘之流，且兩隊特多籃球壇止久負盛名之士，各有經騐，各有絕技，表演之精彩，可以預下也。</p>
<h3>今晨足球聯賽　東葡大戰前言</h3>
<p>今日上午十時，在逸園東華葡商一役，允稱本季開賽以來最精彩之一幕，兩雄相逢，惡戰自在意中，且本屆係採單循環制，勝負有關錦標前途，雙方必更謹愼將事，以求一逞。故除鬥力外，允需鬥智，那一隊調度有方，運略得宜，那一隊便獲勝利。</p>
<p>葡商陣容標悍可畏</p>
<p>葡商出塲陣容，已於日前公佈，與在福利賽戰聯誼時略有更調。老英雄考司坦改踢左前衛，而以鮑休脫出主中軍，左翼由後起之秀凱麻波羅充任。經此調整，中衛綫固若金湯，倍見雄厚，前鋒亦極標悍可畏。觀共日來勵兵秣馬，劍及履及，司馬之心，不問可知。東華臨茲大敵，義無反顧。惟能否痛飮黃龍，余實爲危。東華最近幾塲比賽，演出未臻理想。老將中除戴麟經外，其餘均不够氣，李寗孫錦順如不能恢復上季末顚峯姿態，則此一仗委實兇多吉少，更不能不令人憂心！</p>
<p>鉗住福恩制勝關鍵</p>
<p>論前鋒，葡遜中內衛則東不如葡。福恩爲滬上　佳右翼，盤傳切射，迅如鷹隼，係葡隊中般危險人物。比速度，阿梁李寗遠非其敵，此子不可與力拚，應視球勢，站住適常地位，予以先後夾擊，憑梁李二人之經騐，並出全力對付，或可阻其兇燄。鐔福禎除在中塲擱襲外，應常退後助守，以補梁李之不足，福恩如被關煞，葡之右路攻勢必大見削弱，而大局安定矣。考司坦旣任左得球後，切忘多盤，須視機會將球向前挑送，然後機會將球向前挑送，然後與之作三十碼距離之奔跑，逮共力竭，再行進取。考老矣，經騐雖豐，以言長力，究竟敵不過血氣方剛之小伙子也。</p>
<p>張邦綸近况欠佳，此次冀能力圖振作，對於V蘇若之冷箭，允應格外留意。張林根不宜遠出，嚴密監視蘇若，不予絲毫放鬆，蘇如减少活動，則葡之右路攻勢，亦不足畏矣</p>
<p>總之，此役爲一智與力之鬥爭。以東華諸將之精神旺盛，同仇敵風，茍能穩紮穩打，步步爲營，則葡雖頑强，要非不可破也，勉旃望旃！</p>
<h3>百餘健兒參加　運動大會</h3>
<p>上海靑年會體育部主辦全滬秋季運動大會，於今日上午九時起，假泰山路吳興路（近汶林路）俄僑體育會新田徑塲舉行。參加者男女健兒，共計一一百十一人。滬上田徑名將如短跑之朱沙飛，標槍王學武，跳遠劉德寬，跳高李震中，鐵餅郭其昌，鉛球關宏達，及長跑王正林樓文敖等無不繼羅儘致，誠戰事以後環滬上田徑運動之空前盛會。幷有靑年中學表演團體操，精武體育會，民生國術研究社，新聞報國術班及靑年會表演各種國術與拌角，靑年會健身團表演舉重及健美體格鍛練法，國術名教師佟忠義于福鴻亦被邀請到塲表演生平絕技。大會得靑年會會友張溎祥熱心贊助，負擔經費，並向各方徵集獎品頗多。（樂）</p>
<h3>什錦</h3>
<p>鐵夫足籃球隊，於本週一出征南通，爲該地冬賑籌款，並有女明星四姊妹偕行，全體即將於今日返滬。</p>
<p>晨友盃後，據說將有銀行盃舉行，自限於銀行從業員，鹽業謝益欽極爲起勁。蓋謝君乃前辦銀錢聯誼會籃球聯賽之主幹，此次死灰復燃，要亦鑒於銀行員之生活過於苦悶</p>
<p>正行女子中學發起主辦正行盃全滬女子個人乒乓錦標賽，章程等由委員陳霖笙草擬，於今日下午三時，在該校開委員會義，並歡迎顧問（球大王）</p>

<h3>Exerting the Full Strength of Six Armies in a Total Offensive Against the Siegfried Line; Fierce Battles Underway at Three Key Points</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - Eisenhower dispatched the U.S. Ninth Army, the last of his reserve forces, to the front lines on the 16th, confirming German expectations. A major offensive and defensive battle has finally unfolded along the 700-kilometer line winding from the Dutch coast to the Swiss border. The focal points of the entire front are currently the Metz, Aachen, and Venlo regions. An overview of the battle situation is as follows: (1) Although the French army has launched an offensive from the Swiss border towards Saarbrücken, its objective is clearly to reach the Rhine River via Belfort and Mulhouse, between the Jura and Vosges Mountains in Switzerland, to cover the main force of the British army and attack the German army in the center of the Western Front. The U.S. Seventh Army and the French army are simultaneously launching a direct attack on the Vosges Mountains. (1) The U.S. Third Army, under the command of Patton, is launching a concentrated attack on Metz, but its objective is to assemble super-heavy artillery to break through the German defense line and reach the mouth of the Main River via the Saar. The northern flank of this army has also amassed significant forces. (1) The British Second Army and the U.S. forces are closely coordinating their offensives, launching an offensive in the Venlo region, with the Canadian army positioned on the northernmost wing. Judging from the above situation, Eisenhower has exerted the full strength of all six of his armies in the attack on the Siegfried Line. However, the anti-Axis forces will find it extremely difficult to achieve their desired objectives, as the critical factor in determining the outcome of the battle, time, is already running late.</p>
<p>Northern Front Battles Approaching Cologne</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - The anti-Axis forces are currently launching a fierce offensive against Cologne, the heart of German heavy industry, and have reportedly broken into the Strasbourg and Karlsruhe regions. According to reports from London, the U.S. First and Ninth Armies are engaged in fierce battles 30 kilometers south of Cologne, and have reportedly advanced to a point 7 kilometers from Jülich, a key transportation hub in the Cologne Plain.</p>
<p>Supporting with a Fierce Bombardment of a Thousand Aircraft</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Havas News Agency) - The U.S. Ninth Army's new offensive in the Aachen area was launched thanks to improved flying weather. The attack was preceded by a bombardment of over a thousand aircraft, followed by an infantry and tank assault. Autumn weather often favors the anti-Axis forces while being unfavorable to the German defenders. Furthermore, there is more cloud cover on the continent this year, making it difficult for German aircraft to take off and land, while the weather in the British Isles is clear, allowing British aircraft to frequently reach the European continent.</p>
<h3>New Developments Expected in the European Situation; Roosevelt Elaborates on the War Situation to Reporters</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch: President Roosevelt met with reporters yesterday, extending the meeting to over one and a half hours to explain the new military operations on the European front. Political and financial circles in the U.S. speculate that major new developments may occur in Europe in the near future.</p>

<p>Article 17: These detailed rules will take effect from the date of promulgation. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Two Police Officers Abusing Authority; Fisherman Beaten to Death; Court Case Concluded Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhu Daoyuan, a police officer at the Yanjiabridge Police Station of the Yangjing Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau, was ordered to be on duty at Yanjiabridge on August 22nd of this year at 5:00 PM. A fishing boat happened to pass by Yanjiabridge, and Zhu ordered it to stop for inspection. It turned out that Zhu had attempted to extort money from the boat owner but failed, leading to an altercation with crew member Chu Xinggeng. Zhu, feeling that his dignity as a police officer had been insulted, returned to the station and, together with another police officer, Wang Guangjiang (28 years old, from Nanjing), went back to the boat, carrying ropes. Upon seeing this, Chu Xinggeng, alarmed, went ashore to escape, but the two police officers gave chase. At the Huangpu River, Chu Xinggeng, in a moment of desperation, jumped into the river and drowned. After an investigation by the local procuratorate, the facts were confirmed, and the two police officers were prosecuted for abuse of authority leading to death. The case was formally heard in the Criminal Division No. 4 of the District Court yesterday. The two defendants completely denied the charges during the questioning, but with the case already clear, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled a date for the verdict.</p>
<h3>Over One Hundred Organizations in This City Send Condolences to Madam Wang; Memorial Services in Nanjing End on the 22nd</h3>
<p>Upon hearing the news of Chairman Wang's passing, the entire nation mourned. In addition to observing the mourning rites as stipulated by the central government, various organizations and institutions in this city have sent condolences to Madam Wang. Yesterday, a total of 123 organizations sent telegrams of condolence to Madam Wang, including 31 trade unions, 36 hometown associations, 17 police bureaus, baojia offices, and baojia units from various districts, and 39 other organizations such as charitable groups, industry associations, welfare societies, sports associations, women's associations, journalists' associations, Confucian associations, and the Anqing Association. These organizations sent telegrams jointly based on the similarity of their nature.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from the Memorial Service Committee for the Late Chairman Wang in Nanjing, the deadline for officials and civilians from other provinces to travel to Nanjing to pay their respects is the 22nd of this month. The original telegram is as follows: "The date for public memorial services for the late Chairman Wang by various organizations and institutions in Nanjing has ended. Officials and civilians from other provinces may still visit the spirit and pay their respects until the 22nd of this month." It is reported that the municipal government has instructed all its subordinate agencies to take note.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Economic Relations Between Central China and Manchuria</h3>
<p>Gu Hai, the Director of General Affairs of Manchukuo, who came to Shanghai to attend the Sino-Manchu Economic Adjustment Conference, met with reporters on the 15th and issued a statement on Manchukuo's mission of wartime economy and on the adjustment of the economic relations between Central China and Manchuria, as follows: The past economic relations between Central China and Manchuria cannot be described as smooth. Now that the situation has entered a decisive stage, it is necessary to overcome all difficulties in order to achieve a satisfactory adjustment. Regarding the price issue, it will naturally be easier to resolve after the establishment of credit lending. In short, the primary task is to enable the mutual exchange of important products between the two regions. As for the handling of credit lending, efforts must be made to eliminate trivial "broker" concepts based on this. Fortunately, several hundred million credits have been established between Manchuria and Central China, and an economic adjustment between the two regions has been largely agreed upon based on mutual understanding. Now, efforts must be made to promote the exchange of goods between the two regions based on this principle.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Actively Promoting Crime Prevention Work</h3>
<p>The Crime Prevention Section of the Judicial Division of the Municipal Police Bureau is sparing no effort in planning and implementing crime prevention work. In terms of publicity, in addition to publishing regular publications, they are also staging a crime prevention drama, "Repentance," at the Lyceum Theatre for four days starting today (19th), and are also issuing "The Significance of Crime Prevention," on the one hand to show the importance the police authorities attach to crime prevention, and on the other hand to request the popularization of general legal knowledge among the people and the cooperation of all sectors of society. However, on the part of the people, it goes without saying that they deeply hope that the police bureau will maintain public order, but they even more earnestly hope that the police and judicial departments themselves will rectify themselves to achieve a state of integrity and public service. In this way, the "know-it-all" police administration of the past can be eliminated once and for all, and the true spirit of the rule of law can be brought into full play. By correcting oneself and others, the ultimate goal of crime prevention can be achieved.</p>
<h3>Director Ye's Remarks on the Aftermath of the Nantong Maru Incident</h3>
<p>Regarding the sinking of the China Shipping Company's Nantong Maru at Hupu on October 23rd, which resulted in the drowning of over a thousand passengers, Director Ye Xuesong of the Public Utilities Bureau made the following remarks yesterday on the aftermath of the incident: The bureau attaches great importance to this case. The company's Huatai Maru suffered an accident last winter, and the matter has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. Now, history has repeated itself, which is deeply regrettable.

<h3>China Art Gallery to Open Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Our country's art and culture originated earliest, and for thousands of years, cultural relics have been brilliant. The national spirit is treasured within them. However, due to the lack of organized research work in the country, valuable cultural relics left over from past dynasties have either flowed into foreign countries or been locked away in the hands of private individuals. The public rarely has the opportunity to see them, which has had a significant impact on the progress of art and culture. In view of this, prominent figures in Shanghai, such as Tang Wenzhi, Zhao Shuru, Hu Puan, Ding Fubao, Xu Langxi, Wu Zhenxiu, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Yuquan, and Chen Binhe, have established the China Art Gallery to preserve antiquities, conduct public research, promote art, and enhance culture. The opening is scheduled for 10:00 AM tomorrow. The gallery has collected famous porcelain from past dynasties from major collectors in Shanghai. These are the most artistically valuable antiquities in our country and will be systematically displayed during the opening period. This is truly an unprecedented event. Admission tickets will not be charged. However, in order to limit the number of people, each person is requested to donate 50 yuan to the Shen Bao Education Fund and the China Health Association to benefit poor students and promote public health. To admire the creations of our ancestors and promote our national spirit is truly food for the soul of the masses and a good opportunity to appreciate ancient art. It is hoped that schools and institutions will visit in groups. (The gallery is located at 996 Jing'an Temple Road, Majestic Building).</p>

<h3>Divine Wind Special Attack Force: Establishing Extraordinary Merit in the Seas off the Philippines, Turning Enemy American Pacific Fleet into Seaweed Scum</h3>
<p>The day has finally arrived when the arrogant enemy American fleet is turned into a layer of seaweed in the Pacific. On October 25th, the Japanese Navy suddenly launched a fierce sea-air integrated attack on the main force of the remaining enemy American fleet in the eastern waters off the Philippines. We had been eagerly anticipating such a day, praying to gods and Buddhas, hoping it would come soon, and now it has indeed arrived. Who could forget the emotions of excitement and emotion on this day? Days ago, naval aviators who had looked proudly at the vast sky, lamenting the absence of enemy aircraft, are now piloting elite aircraft, like clouds and rosy clouds, bravely heading to annihilate the enemy.</p>
<p>On this day, the weather in the Philippines was clear after a long period of rain. Today is suitable for carrying out an attack. The Allied aircraft, gathered day and night, had all preparations completed thanks to the tireless efforts of the maintenance personnel before the general attack was about to begin. The first wave of strikes to annihilate the enemy was launched by the preemptive attack of the Naval Air Force. The target was the enemy's aircraft carrier groups. The enemy forces that had invaded Leyte Gulf and forcibly landed near Tacloban were mobilizing the full force of their remaining fleet in the Philippines to establish a strong bridgehead to protect these landing troops. Only after resolving the enemy's air force in this area could the fleet fully exert its power under our air supremacy. Therefore, the mission of the Naval Air Force at the Philippine base was indeed significant. As soon as the order for the general attack came down, aircraft roared and took off from the base one after another.</p>
<p>All members of the Naval Air Force were prepared to die. Among them, the Divine Wind Special Attack Force was the essence of the Japanese Navy, and the name of these guardian eagles of the nation should be forever remembered. With their fearless spirit of attacking with human bombs, they crashed into enemy aircraft carriers with their aircraft. Once they flew out of the base and discovered the enemy American mobile force, they would never return. This kind of desperate special attack force was the main axis of the front-line air force, organized and successfully trained as a suicide air squad to shoulder the important task of the survival of the motherland.</p>
<p>"We are the ones who stand at the forefront of the entire nation to embark on this mission, permanently protecting the glorious history of the motherland. The tradition of the Imperial Navy must be demonstrated today!" With such a belief, the young naval aviators were boiling with passion. The commander, who personally visited the base of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force, was deeply moved by the tragic mood of the young aviators, and when he delivered his training speech with tears in his eyes, the young warriors did not even flinch.</p>
<p>Calm and Composed</p>
<p>On the 25th, the time for the general attack had arrived. The young warriors of the Special Attack Force, looking up at the clear sky, said lightly:</p>
<p>"Today we will definitely do it!"</p>
<p>"Please take care of everything!" While saying this, they warmly shook the hands of the maintenance personnel. Here and there, there were shouts of joy. Afterwards, everyone silently raised their hands to salute each other.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, everyone had this kind of silent attitude at the moment of setting off on this suicide attack, because in the distant homeland, there were elderly parents, and there were also beloved wives who had just married this spring. So, what were these young aviators thinking in their hearts now? In the rumbling of the aircraft, the reporter stared at the young warriors climbing into their beloved aircraft, their mouths tightly closed, and a firm resolution could be seen. Their faces also floated with a quiet smile. Calmly and composedly, they performed their usual actions. Once they became a part of the aircraft, the only thought in the minds of the naval aviators was to sortie and sink the enemy aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>Anxiously Awaiting Good News</p>
<p>The sound of the aircraft engines roared crisply. The aircraft took off smoothly along the runway, one after another. Some of the warriors waved goodbye to the personnel on the ground, while others single-mindedly operated their aircraft. They formed a formation over the base. This first attack team of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force then disappeared into the blue sky. Afterwards, several hours had passed. If they had not discovered the enemy, then they should have already been attacking the enemy aircraft carriers. The base suddenly became noisy.</p>
<p>After discovering them, what would happen? It would be best if they did it smoothly. But if they were blocked by the enemy's defensive fire and could not hit the aircraft carriers, wouldn't the death of the young warriors be too regrettable? At this time, everyone couldn't help but worry.</p>
<p>Mission Accomplished</p>
<p>However, that afternoon, a report witnessed by Allied aircraft came from another base, and the situation was as follows:</p>
<p>"The first Special Attack Force discovered the enemy American mobile force in the waters off Surigao to coordinates 〇〇. Two aircraft crashed into aircraft carriers and sank them; one aircraft crashed into an aircraft carrier, setting it on fire (the enemy aircraft carrier was rendered unable to navigate); one aircraft hit a cruiser and sank it."</p>
<p>Ah, how tragic! It was not that bombs had hit the enemy ships, but that the aircraft, along with the people inside, had crashed into the enemy ships. The mission of the first Special Attack Force had been completed. Upon receiving the report of this great achievement, the commander simply closed his eyes and said:</p>
<p>"Now, the young team members have become gods. I have always thought so."</p>
<p>In this way, the enemy American fleet was successively transformed into a layer of seaweed in the Pacific. This was because the arrogant enemy American forces had underestimated the strength of the Japanese Navy, and at the same time, they had underestimated the spirit of the Naval Air Force, which was burning with utmost sincerity to serve the country with loyalty.

<h3>Modern Divine Wind</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 25th, when successive reports of victory from the seas east of the Philippines were coming in, the command headquarters of the front-line base received the following radio telegram:</p>
<p>"Shikishima Team's battle results: One aircraft carrier sunk by one aircraft crashing into it; one aircraft carrier set on fire by one aircraft crashing into it, rendering it unable to navigate; one cruiser sunk by one aircraft hitting it."</p>
<p>Ah, this battle result! This was the first report of the noble battle results obtained by the Shikishima Team, the first attack team of the Japanese Navy's Divine Wind Special Attack Force, using their bodies and beloved aircraft instead of bombs! After this, the good news from the second, third, and subsequent Divine Wind Teams would follow one after another. Divine Wind Special Attack Force, what a noble name! This is to pilot aircraft equipped with special explosive devices, with the determination to die, to carry out bombing. In the history of aerial warfare, it can be said to be an unprecedented pioneering feat. This is a suicide aerial attack that only the Japanese Air Force can accomplish. Moreover, the warriors of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force, centered on young naval air corps leaders, are all very young. As for its mission, as its name suggests, in this sea battle in the waters off the Philippines, where the fate of the country is at stake, the suicide close combat attack has stirred up the divine wind of victory (Translator's note: In May 1280, the Yuan army launched a large-scale attack on Japan. In the seventh lunar month, a hurricane suddenly arose at sea, and almost all of the Yuan army's ships were overturned. Therefore, there is a saying of divine wind in Japanese history.). Therefore, the various attack teams of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force, as the vanguard of the various carrier-based bomber squadrons, successively departed from the base, never to return. The following is the situation from the birth of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force to its sortie, as witnessed by the reporter at the base where the command headquarters was located.</p>
<p>Spirit of Suicide</p>
<p>On the 20th, when the enemy forces began to land on Leyte Island in the central Philippines, the base was filled with a murderous atmosphere from dawn. "Have you come, you arrogant enemies!" The time to annihilate the enemy with death had arrived. The eyes of every "sea eagle" shone with the light of annihilating the enemy, revealing the determination to serve the country with death. They had been formed for such a day, and they had been training intensely. Now, the day to exert their power had finally arrived! Unprecedented shouts of "Banzai! Banzai!" spontaneously erupted at the base. The selected warriors of the attack team were all experienced young soldiers aged nineteen to twenty-four. This suicide air squad was divided into the first attack team, the second attack team, and the third attack team, etc., and lined up in formation. At 10:00 a.m., Commander 〇〇 Lieutenant General from a certain base gathered all the members of the Special Attack Force in front of the headquarters and gave them a speech of encouragement and gratitude for their sortie.</p>
<p>"The rise and fall of the country depends on this battle, and it rests on your shoulders! The divine wind of victory in this great Pacific decisive battle will be stirred up by your human bombs. For His Imperial Majesty, for the country, this commander-in-chief hopes that you will silently devote your lives with utmost loyalty!"</p>
<p>The eyes of the young aviators were as clear as autumn water, gazing at 〇〇 Lieutenant General. Beside him were Commander Y and Deputy Commander K with clenched fists. The Lieutenant General's voice and body trembled slightly as he continued:</p>
<p>"The only regret for all of you must be that after the close combat attack on the enemy fleet, you will not be able to know the war exploits you have established. However, your comrades who are directly covering you will definitely see clearly and report to the commander-in-chief. The commander-in-chief will definitely report the battle results to all of you and report them to His Imperial Majesty. So, there is no need to feel regret."</p>
<p>After the encouragement ended, the commander-in-chief and the young warriors of the Special Attack Force warmly shook hands.</p>
<p>After that, the sounds of "Sea March" and "Preparatory Course Training Song" being sung in unison resounded like thunder, shaking the earth. Amidst the murderous atmosphere and excitement, the Divine Wind Special Attack Force was born, with Naval Air Corps Captain Seki, a battle-hardened veteran, as the leader.</p>
<p>The Wind Howls</p>
<p>The time for self-sacrifice had come. The first attack team, "Shikishima Team," finally sortied to attack. At dawn on the 25th, on the silent base soaked in the morning dew, the Divine Wind attack aircraft, which had been meticulously prepared by the maintenance personnel overnight, emitted a rumbling roar. Inside the command post, spreading out a map, the deputy commander carefully told the warriors of the attack team:</p>
<p>"The target of the attack is the enemy aircraft carrier. When crashing, you must aim at the weak point of the aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the leader of the first attack team, Shikishima Team, Captain Seki, loudly said to his subordinates:</p>
<p>"We are not bombers, we are bombs. Follow me!"</p>
<p>Captain Seki's eyes were bright, radiating the light of determination to die. The pupils of each suicide aviator also revealed a fearless divine light. It was time to sortie. The young members of the suicide squad, with pure white cloths wrapped around their heads, fully expressed their determination, and without even taking parachutes, they successively boarded the aircraft equipped with special explosive devices. The engine roared, and the leader's aircraft took off first, followed by the second and third aircraft. A burst of smoke rose above the base. The people on the aircraft waved their hands, making their final farewells. The warriors departed, never to return. The Divine Wind Shikishima Team flew away from the base in a mighty manner; from now on, they would never return.</p>
<p>Commander Y, with an injured right elbow, leaned on crutches, leaning on a soldier's body, personally saw off his young warrior subordinates departing. The deputy commander also looked up at the Shikishima Team, constantly waving his sun helmet until the silhouette of the Shikishima Team's aircraft deeply disappeared into the southern sky.

<h3>Situation Map of Leyte Island</h3>
<p>One month has passed since the enemy Americans landed on Leyte Island, and the land, sea, and air battles surrounding the island have become increasingly fierce. On the land, Japanese and enemy soldiers are engaged in close combat in the dense forests. The Japanese Air Force is fiercely bombing the enemy airfield in the vicinity of Balu. In the waters east of Samar Island, enemy convoys have suffered heavy damage, and enemy forces in the vicinity of Ormoc have also suffered heavy blows.</p>

<h3>The Eve of Farewell</h3>
<p>— Mingyan</p>
<p>For the sake of life, I have to carry my bags and go to another country.</p>
<p>The ticket was bought at the last minute. In principle, that night should have been an opportunity to say goodbye to relatives and friends, to let them know that I have begun to stand on my own, to use my own strength to seek independent survival. Who says that a girl has no way to go except to marry! But no, I didn't say a word to a relative or a friend. Even if I did, what would happen? At best, they would put on a façade of sadness at the parting, and say, "Write to us when you get there!" "When will you come back?" False and indifferent verbal concern, for them it's just doing their duty, but on the contrary, I would feel sadly grieved. Obviously, there is no one here who truly cares about or is concerned about me!</p>
<p>How lonely and deserted I seem this evening! Not a single person came to visit me. No wonder, who knew that you were leaving quietly? No one even gave me a farewell dinner. I still had to heat up the leftover cold rice from the morning to eat. However, staring at the cold charcoal stove in the corner, I was stunned: that small pot had long been returned to the landlady downstairs. As the saying goes, "Cold tea and cold rice are easy to swallow, but cold words and hot tempers are hard to bear." Never mind! Eat, pick it up, and shove it into my mouth. No vegetables? There is a cookbook on the table, with recipes for stir-fried tofu with fresh shrimp, braised pork with chestnuts, fried noodles… I ate a mouthful, then another, with a plate of pickled radish shreds on the side.</p>
<p>Passing through my throat, it slid down like a block of ice, and the accompanying radish shreds regurgitated a sour taste, with a hint of coldness in the sourness, but not bitter! The feeling in my heart was also cold, but very calm. This calmness was disturbed until a knock on the door sounded outside. However, even though the knocking disturbed the quiet air, I still didn't forget to hide the bowls and plates, wipe my lips, and pretend that I hadn't eaten cold rice.</p>
<p>The person who came in surprised me. She was carrying a food container and said in a tone that was both reproachful and kind:</p>
<p>"You're leaving tomorrow, and others didn't say goodbye, but why didn't you even acknowledge your grandmother! Sigh! Young people are rash in their actions. If I hadn't come this morning and found you not in the house, seeing your packed luggage, I wouldn't have known that you were really leaving tomorrow..."</p>
<p>I took the food container from her hand, smiled but said nothing, and also condemned myself for being muddleheaded in my actions.</p>
<p>The lid of the container was lifted, and a fragrant and sweet warmth wafted out. I jumped up with joy and took my grandmother's hand. She looked at me with a sad smile:</p>
<p>"Eat it! It's still hot. Once you leave like this, I don't know when you'll be back..." Yes, "Once you leave like this, I don't know when you'll be back..." These were my grandmother's words. This sentence was very familiar. I had heard it more than once. Her daughters and her sons, she seemed to have said this to all of them. She sent her daughter to another world, and she let her two sons go far away to the border. She often said to me: Wang Sanjie guarded her husband (Xue Pinggui) for eighteen years, but when would she be able to wait for her sons? When she thought of her sons, she burst into tears and asked me to write letters for her. There seemed to be a lot of words in the letters, but in the final analysis, they were nothing more than urging them to come back soon. She missed them, she thought they should also be thinking of her. After sealing the envelope, she took me to the post office and watched it being dropped into the mailbox with her own eyes. In fact, this letter had nowhere to go, it would probably fall into the hands of some stranger and be torn up, this was what I thought in my heart, but I never had the courage to say it.</p>
<p>Now she was about to send away her only granddaughter again, without much grief; only a silent sigh...</p>
<p>She watched as the steamed bun, which had frozen and wrinkled after being exposed to the air, urged me to eat more, wishing she could stuff it all into my stomach.</p>
<p>Under the dim lamplight, these two lonely people sat facing each other, one old and one young. Heaven seemed to have deliberately arranged for the two of us to coincide together, you pitying me, I caring for you.</p>
<p>In the misty dawn, we were about to part. Before getting on the train, she tightly urged me: "Write to us!" I nodded silently, but I couldn't hear a single word from her trembling lips...</p>
<p>The streetlights gradually dimmed in the bright morning, and when I turned my head, ahead was already a blue sky and a vast wilderness. I don't know when, but the army had already traveled hundreds of miles away.</p>
<h3>Evening</h3>
<p>— Junyang</p>
<p>Looking at the ceiling darkened by cooking smoke,</p>
<p>The color of the street is lonely, cold, and deep,</p>
<p>A series of whistles rang out,</p>
<p>The crows are tired travelers returning home,</p>
<p>A crack in someone's window spilled out light,</p>
<p>You should go home too</p>
<p>However, where is my home?</p>
<h3>Autumn</h3>
<p>— Junyang</p>
<p>The eaves are weeping,</p>
<p>The window bridge is sighing,</p>
<p>The phoenix tree is also withering for you,</p>
<p>What kind of sorrow are you harboring,</p>
<p>Touching people's hearts so deeply?</p>
<h3>The Bicycle Story</h3>
<p>— Lanying</p>
<p>Written for the "Traffic Safety Campaign"</p>
<p>Taosheng's father bought a new bicycle, but in less than a week, he took it to sell again, and exchanged it for a 70% new, half-old bicycle.</p>
<p>It turned out that after secretly calculating, his father felt that at this time and place, riding a bicycle was much more convenient than taking the train, and from an economic and spiritual point of view, paying small amounts of money for tickets and being crowded or yelled at in the train all the time were both more worthwhile. He had the intention of buying a bicycle for his eldest daughter Taosheng, who left early and returned late, but he couldn't raise enough money for a while, so in a flash of thought, he sold his own brand-new bicycle and bought a half-new one instead. He gave the extra money to Taosheng and told her to find and purchase it herself according to the amount of money. A father's love is great.</p>
<p>With a heart full of gratitude and respect, and indescribable happiness, Taosheng began to ask her friends everywhere for help, seeking a suitable bicycle. Two weeks later, she was finally introduced to Mr. Shi by a colleague, and with Mr. Shi's enthusiastic guidance, she finally settled on an old bicycle of the so-called "coming from a certain source." However, although it was old, it was very useful. One day, in September, the wild chrysanthemums were kissing the setting sun in a drunken embrace, it was a bright near dusk. Mr. Shi came to visit Taosheng.</p>
<p>"Mr. Shi, I got into trouble when I went out this morning. There's something wrong with the bicycle, it keeps making a rattling noise when I pedal it. I was just about to go out to repair it!"</p>
<p>Whenever they met for the first time, they knew each other because of singing, and after that, they always liked to talk about singing. Similarly, when Taosheng saw Mr. Shi, the words about the bicycle blurted out without thinking.</p>
<p>"Did you hurt yourself? What happened?" Mr. Shi asked.</p>
<p>"It's also because I was riding too fast, but I can't blame myself entirely. When the bicycle passed the Gaoshan intersection, there were a pile of people waiting for the train, there were more than thirty or fifty people in total. I kept ringing the bell all the way, when suddenly a man squeezed out from the side, standing in the middle of the road numbly, and asking the question of "Has the train arrived yet?" At that time I could not stop the bicycle, for fear of hitting the man, so I knocked myself down on the tram tracks." Taosheng is an innocent and naughty girl, and made the action when she speaks. After roughly said, her eyebrows were still left with a sigh of annoyance.</p>
<p>"Let me take the bicycle back and repair it for you. — Do you not believe that I can repair it well?" Mr. Shi said, and made a polite smile. Taosheng did not want him to take it back for repair, because if he repaired it well, she will owe him a favor, if he did not repair it well, she can not complain, but wasted time. However, he already said those words, she couldn’t say not let him to repair, it showed that she did not believe that he could repair it, but it would make him embarrassing immediately. She had to give the bicycle to him.</p>
<p>The amateur trainee is not a professional worker. Because of the failure of the bicycle body parts, Taosheng fell again, and almost missed the past large card past the large card.</p>
<p>Taosheng, in frustration, could not help but complain to Mr. Shi.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Shi, the joy in his heart aroused ten times of diligence, and he became more and more eager.</p>
<p>One day, Taosheng pushed the bicycle out of the office, and met Mr. Shi at the door. Mr. Shi was also riding a bicycle, and accompanied her home all the way. On the way, he repeatedly invited her to drink tea and rest, and could not resist Taosheng's refusal. He pulled it up again, wanted to say some things to say. Speaking is like writing an article. If you speak well, it is well-organized, concise and pertinent; if you speak badly, it is messy. In particular, you cannot attract people's attention. In the end, even I was confused. You don't look at whether there are any cars next to you in the front, nor do you care if there are any cars next to you...</p>
<p>"Kacha..." — A bicycle hit the traffic cop's stone platform, and the car body finally fell on the asphalt road, and the owner of the vehicle fell on the ground. A three-wheel bike sped past the body, and took a piece of skin from his arm. A rickshaw behind did not pull it from the bicycle irreproachably.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "There is one, there is two, there must be three!" Taosheng has fallen twice in a row, and this time even she herself thought that she would have to bring trouble.</p>
<p>However, in fact, it was Mr. Shi who was injured, not her. This time, Mr. Shi's ankle bone was broken!</p>
<p>Taosheng returned home, and did not speak for a long time. Later, she told his father seriously: "Father, we must not ride too fast when we ride a bicycle in the future. Especially, don't talk to people on the bicycle, and we should always check our own bicycle to see if there is any problem, otherwise it is too dangerous. The road is like the tiger's mouth."</p>
<p>Father nodded.</p>
<p>From then on, Taosheng was cautious and careful. However, who dares to say that there are no careless cyclists on the road!</p>

<h3>Shanghai News Cup Basketball League: Recent Trends in Groups A and B</h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Cup Basketball League for Groups A and B is progressing well. After a week's suspension, the games will resume today as scheduled. Here is a recent analysis of the situation in each division of Groups A and B, which team members and fans can use as a guide.</p>
<p>Group A: Hualian Pharmaceutical Leads the Pack</p>
<p>Hualian Pharmaceutical has won all six of its matches and remains undefeated, making it the strongest contender for the championship. Second to them is Changyi Zhongbei Shantou team, with only one loss, closely following behind. Dahua and Huanan have each lost twice but can still strive for a higher ranking. Mingxing, Renyu, Tongren, and Huaying will compete for position. V, having lost all its matches, seems destined for the bottom spot. Attached is a table showing the current standings:</p>
<p>Group B Division 1: Renyu and Lusheng Evenly Matched</p>
<p>In Group B Division 1, Renyu and Lusheng are evenly matched, both currently winning all their matches. The two teams also met in the Chenyou Cup, where Lusheng won by a significant margin. Renyu has strengthened its team for this league, determined to avenge that defeat and win the division championship. Chengfu is highly motivated, while Zhonghang and Fanjiang lack the strength to compete.</p>
<p>Group B Division 2: Dahua Zhongchu and the "Fat Team" Compete</p>
<p>In this division, the "Fat Team" and Zhongchu have both won all three of their matches. Dahua B, with two wins in two matches, is also in contention. In terms of pure strength, Dahua appears to be the stronger team, but the "Fat Team" players are experienced and may have clever strategies to defeat their opponents. Therefore, the top two teams in this division will be fiercely contested by the above two teams. Zhongchu also enjoys a strong reputation in the banking industry. As a result, this division is the most exciting and competitive.</p>
<p>Group B Division 3: Flying Team Shines, Qingxie Shows Promise</p>
<p>The Flying Team in Division 3 has won all four of its matches, giving them a bright future. However, Qingxie, with fewer matches played, also maintains an undefeated record. Qingxie has shown great improvement recently and has won other Group B league championships. It remains to be seen whether they can stand out and surpass the Flying Team. Feihong has yet to win a match and currently sits at the bottom.</p>
<p>Group B Division 4: Muer Undefeated, Shantou Closely Follows</p>
<p>Shantou team continues its style from Group A, putting on a particularly good show. In Group B, they are a rare team. Currently, they have played two fewer matches, so they are ranked after Muer, which has four wins in four matches. However, when Shantou meets Muer in the future, the latter may find it difficult to blunt its edge. Shantou is considered the most promising, followed by Muer. The Zha team is mediocre and unlikely to develop. Xiafeng still has potential.</p>
<p>Group B Division 5: Chenyou Blue Stands Out</p>
<p>The teams in Division 5 are the most evenly matched. For example, Zhenyuan has lost twice in a row, but only by a small margin. Tiefu has also unfortunately suffered a crushing defeat once, but still has hope for the future. Chenyou Blue currently stands out, but there are many hidden challenges ahead, and they must proceed with caution. The team has veterans like Wang Lidu and Wang Cunrui, making it easier for them to develop further. Linglong is the weakest team.</p>
<p>Group B Division 6: Zhongbei and Lingyou Vie for Top Spot</p>
<p>In this division, Qiangshi and Jianyi are likely to be at the bottom. However, Qiangshi is organized purely by teachers and staff from a school, making it unique in Shanghai. Although their skills are weaker, this is worth mentioning. The leader of this division is likely to be Zhongbei, influenced by Group A players. Moreover, with skilled players like Mu Shiyan, there are high hopes that they will surpass Lingyou and seize the top spot.</p>
<p>Overall, Group B has not yet reached a critical point. The games will resume today, and the competition will become increasingly intense. It is predicted that the young heroes will be ready for battle, hoping to win the division championship. After the division champions are determined, they will compete for the overall championship, with the elite from the six divisions facing off, which may be no less exciting than the Group A matches. Many rising stars may emerge from this process.</p>
<p>Games Resume Today After One-Week Suspension</p>
<p>The Shanghai News Cup will continue as usual today. The schedule remains the same, except that the games originally scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of next week will be made up for the three days of suspension this week. The schedule for the following weeks will follow this pattern, except for Sundays. There are many exciting Group A matches next week, with the Dahua-Mingxing game on Monday being a highlight. The latter has been practicing diligently, and their skills have been improving rapidly, so Dahua will face a significant threat.</p>
<p>Hualian and Shantou to Clash on Wednesday</p>
<p>The Hualian-Shantou game on Wednesday (the 12th) has become a hot topic among basketball fans. Some say that Hualian will win easily, while others say that Shantou has been biding its time since its crushing defeat by Huanan and will fight back this time. It is said that Shantou has been actively arranging friendly matches with various teams and discussing tactics in the club, showing their ambition. Hualian has maintained a consistent spirit throughout, adhering to their practice schedule. Fans should arrive early on the day to avoid disappointment, as the venue is small and limited.</p>
<p>Two Exciting Group A Matches on Friday</p>
<p>One Group A match on Friday is between Huaying and Mingxing. The former is composed of movie stars, while the latter is organized by employees of the Mingxing Perfume Factory, hence the name. Both "Mingxing" teams have achieved good results, but both teams have the same weakness recently: difficulty fielding a full team. However, this game is very important for their ranking, and they will each do their best. The other match is between Zhongbei and Dahua, which will also be exciting. Zhongbei's performance has a large following, and Dahua is still a top-notch team. Moreover, both teams have many long-established players in the basketball world, each with experience and unique skills, making the performance highly anticipated.</p>
<h3>Preview of Today's Football League: Donghua vs. Portuguese Merchants</h3>
<p>Today at 10 a.m. at Yiyuan, the match between Donghua and Portuguese Merchants is expected to be one of the most exciting games since the start of the season. Two strong teams will clash, and a fierce battle is inevitable. Moreover, this season adopts a single round-robin system, and the outcome is crucial for the championship, so both sides will be extra careful in their preparations and strive for victory. Therefore, in addition to strength, intelligence will also be needed. Whichever team has better tactics and strategies will win.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Merchants' Lineup is Fierce and Intimidating</p>
<p>The lineup of Portuguese Merchants has been announced a few days ago, with slight adjustments compared to the friendly match against Lianyi in the welfare game. Veteran Costa has switched to left midfielder, with Bough taking the central position, and rising star Kaimabolo taking the left wing. With this adjustment, the central defense line is as solid as a rock and even stronger, and the forwards are also extremely fierce and intimidating. They have been training hard recently, showing their determination. Donghua faces a formidable opponent and has no choice but to fight. However, I am worried about whether they can win. Donghua's performance in the last few matches has not been ideal. Apart from veteran Dai Linjing, the other veterans are not in good form. If Li Ning and Sun Jinshun cannot return to their peak form from the end of last season, this battle will be very dangerous, which is worrying!</p>
<p>Restraining Fu En is the Key to Victory</p>
<p>In terms of forwards, Donghua's internal defense is not as good as the Portuguese Merchants'. Fu En is the best right winger in Shanghai, with swift dribbling, passing, and shooting. He is the most dangerous player on the Portuguese team. In terms of speed, A Liang and Li Ning are no match for him. They should not try to compete with him head-on, but rather stand in the appropriate position and attack him from both sides. With Liang and Li's experience and their full effort, they may be able to curb his ferocity. Tan Fuzhen should retreat to help defend, in addition to attacking in the midfield, to make up for Liang and Li's shortcomings. If Fu En is contained, the Portuguese Merchants' right-wing attack will be greatly weakened, and the overall situation will be stabilized. Costa, after receiving the ball on the left, should remember to pass the ball forward when there is an opportunity, and then run with it for about 30 yards, waiting for his opponents to tire out before attacking. Costa is old, and although he has a lot of experience, in terms of stamina, he cannot compete with young players.</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun's recent form has been poor, and he should try to improve. He should pay extra attention to V. Su Ruo's long shots. Zhang Lingen should not venture out too far and should closely monitor Su Ruo, not allowing him to relax at all. If Su Ruo's activity is reduced, the Portuguese Merchant's right-wing attack will not be so fearsome.</p>
<p>In short, this game is a battle of intelligence and strength. With the spirit and unity of Donghua's players, if they can play steadily and cautiously, the Portuguese Merchants, although strong, can be defeated. Let's encourage them!</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Athletes Participate in Sports Meet</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA Sports Department is hosting the Shanghai Autumn Sports Meet at the Russian Emigrant Sports Association's new track and field on Taisan Road, Wuxing Road (near Wenlin Road) starting at 9:00 AM today. A total of 111 male and female athletes will participate. Shanghai track and field stars such as sprinter Zhu Shafei, javelin thrower Wang Xuewu, long jumper Liu Dekuan, high jumper Li Zhenzhong, discus thrower Guo Qichang, shot putter Guan Hongda, and long-distance runners Wang Zhenglin and Lou Wenao will all compete to their fullest extent. This is an unprecedented grand event in Shanghai's track and field movement since the war. There will also be a gymnastics performance by the Qingnian Middle School performance group, various martial arts performances by the Jingwu Athletic Association, the Minsheng Guoshu Research Society, the Xinwenbao Guoshu Class, and the YMCA, weightlifting and bodybuilding exercises by the YMCA fitness group, and martial arts masters Tong Zhongyi and Yu Fuhong have also been invited to perform their lifelong skills. The conference was generously sponsored by YMCA member Zhang Yanxiang, who is responsible for expenses and has collected many prizes from all parties. (Music)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>The Tiefu Football and Basketball Team went to Nantong this Monday to raise funds for winter relief in the area, accompanied by the Four Sisters actresses. The entire group will return to Shanghai today.</p>
<p>After the Chenyou Cup, it is said that a Banking Cup will be held, limited to bank employees. Xie Yiqin of the Salt Industry is very enthusiastic about this. Xie was the backbone of the previous banking friendship basketball league, and this revival is due to the fact that the lives of bank employees are too boring.</p>
<p>Zhengxing Girls' Middle School is organizing the Zhengxing Cup Shanghai Women's Individual Table Tennis Championship. The regulations were drafted by committee member Chen Linsheng. A committee meeting will be held at the school at 3:00 PM today, and advisors (table tennis champions) are welcome.</p>
