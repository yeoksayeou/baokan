<h3>社評　大學生軍事訓練</h3>
<p>大學生的軍事訓練，除了養成初級軍官，上等戰士之外，本身也有三點最大的意義：　規律的訓練，　體格的鍛鍊，　軍事知識的增進。對於大學生軍事訓練問題，盟邦日本最近有二個主要的表現：一是二月四日文部省發表「加强學生軍事敎育要綱」，一是二月六日海軍文部兩省制定的「海軍軍事敎習令實施規則」，決定四月一日起派遣現役海軍官佐到各大學，對最高年級之學生，實施三十時間的海軍軍事敎練。陸軍海軍文部三省同時注意這個問題，聯合制定各種章則，可見這個問題的重要性。</p>
<p>軍事訓練在中國，由來已久，特別是民國二十六年的前幾年，各地學校都舉行軍訓，暑假期間更耍入營訓練。還都以來所辦的靑少年營，也是具體而微的軍訓，可惜範圍不大，受訓人數不多，並不能普遍及於和平區各學校。而各學校的在校軍訓，似乎亦不能够全體實行，我們希望南京國民政府的陸軍部海軍部敎育部仿照盟邦日本的辦法，聯合起來，擬定一個立即可行的軍訓程序。</p>
<p>大學生是國家的元氣。可是說到中國的大學生，除了少數勤儉力學之外，多數因為環境的不安定，不知不覺地走上頹廢的途徑。我們直接看到的或問接聽到的關於大學生的墮落情况很多。但是想到十年二十年後由這般靑年起來擔任國事，我們對於國家的前途眞是「不寒而慄」的。把現在的大學生和從前的大學生相較，大家可以看出現在大學生生活的不規則，學生體格的衰弱，和學生一般知識的缺乏。其原因幷不全在學生方面。軍事訓練可以促進生活的規律化，軍事訓練可以鍛練體格的健康，軍事訓練雖祇能增加軍事常識，但是，一個生活有規律的，身體强壯的學生對於一般的功課，自然也易於吸收而上進。所以軍事訓練的目的，即不談及敎成軍官和戰士，對於學生本身亦有極大的功用。</p>
<p>現在是大東亞戰爭時期，今年尤是決戰年。戰爭是全世界的一個大試騐所，能够適合戰事的自然存在，不能够適合戰事的自然淘汰。戰事好比一個極大的鍊金爐，有極大的火燄在燃燒着，是眞金的國家不怕强烈的火燄，亦惟有眞金的國民方才能够造成眞金的國家。</p>
<p>日本於二月四日發表軍事敎育要綱後，陸軍省那須兵務局長發表談話說，這是實施文武合一敎育。文武合一敎育就是戰時敎育，就是適合於戰時體制的敎育，願我當局「應採取者，決予採取。」（引束條首相語）</p>
<h3>日慶祝建國佳節　舉行宮城遙拜式　天皇對八團體褒賜銀花瓶</h3>

<p>嘉獎柴崎等功績賜予級及勳章　日海軍省賞勳局同時公布</p>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日海軍省十一日下午三時與賞勳局同時公布，日天皇陛下為嘉獎柴崎惠次少將，佐藤泰天大佐，安田義達大佐三人之功績，特賜予昇級及勳章。按此次進級中將，授功二級，旭二等之柴崎棄次少將，當去年十一月二十一日敵軍大部隊在吉爾貝特羣島登陸時曾奮起迎擎，使敵軍蒙受重創，並於常時牽制敵軍强力增援部隊，演成吉爾貝特羣島附近洋面上激烈之空戰，防守五日，終奮戰至最後一兵，而全軍壯烈玉碎，其偉勳可與天地長存。又昇任中將，授功三級，旭二等之佐藤泰夫大佐，開戰當時曾任驅逐艦隊司令，參加戰鬥達二十七次，每戰必身先士卒，斬敵陷陣，屢奏偉功，民國三十二年三月上旬，在新幾內亞方面海域壯烈戰死。又此次昇級中將，授功二級，旭二等之安田義達大佐，民國三十一年十一月中旬以來，曾在新幾內亞，布那兩地處上敵之包圍下，而不為之屈服，督勵部下與陸軍部隊合力作戰，以寡兵獲舉極大戰果，終於民國三十二年一月二日親率部下十數名入敵陣，而壯烈戰死，日軍聯合艦隊司令長官及軍令部總長，聞悉安田部隊之壯烈奮戰消息，當時曾致當激勵日海軍部內之昇進二級者，此為第六次，至以佐官而昇任將官者，則以佐藤，安田兩大佐為嚆矢。</p>

<h3>前田中將演講　太平洋戰局　—在清鄉會議席上—</h3>
<p>中央社京訊　日前田海軍中將於昨（十）日下午，在淸鄉會議席上演請，題為「關於太平洋之現戰局以及美國之戰力」，闡述甚詳，茲錄原文如後：</p>
<p>此次兄弟得以參列灣，鄕會議並得有這個機會，能够向諸位閣下發表所懷之一端，兄弟從心裹感覺得非常光榮。</p>
<p>現在兄弟先以現階段海軍關係戰局為主，再就美國戰力概要講一講。如果多少能够作為諸位的參考，即可以說是幸榮之至。不過有一件事情，先請諸位原諒的，就是在此地開始戰鬥的情况，兄弟不能接到詳細的報吿，所以今天所講的，也就是以一般的發表為根據而說明的，恐怕不能够十分滿足諸位閣下專問的要求，此點先請各位諒解。</p>
<p>現在在太平洋展開最激烈戰鬥的地方，就是馬紹爾方面，以及拉巴爾方面，這是諸位已經知道的。拉巴爾是在大東亞戰爭勃發以後昭和十七年，就是民國三十一年一月下旬，皇軍一舉上陸而占領的。以後作為對於所羅門羣島，新幾內亞東部，以及澳洲東海岸作戰的戰略據點，而嚴重鞏固警備的。等到我們再推進進攻作戰，將以加達爾十納爾島為止之所羅門羣島之全部。以及新幾內亞之東部，都已攻略。將要迫於摩勒斯比的時候，敵方對於這樣形勢，非常驚惶。將其有力部隊極力　中於此方面，開始了執拗反攻，而圖謀挽其劣勢了，這就是前年六七月的事情。以後屢次的展開了海陸空悽慘苦烈之戰鬥，而每次我方獲有赫赫大戰果，這是諸位也知道的。不過這方面的戰鬥，關於補給常有困難問題，若是兵力過　分散了，那麼補給感覺更困難，以致對於作戰全般之指導上，也免不了有種種不利。因此我方看戰局的進展，按着全般戰略的要求，漸漸的縮短了戰綫。現在呢，以一拉巴爾」為中心，對於「新布列顚」島，「新愛爾籣一島，「彼根維爾」島的大部份，以及「新幾內亞」北岸，嚴重鞏固警備，正在有利的阻止敵方猛烈反攻。敵方每日接連不斷的以數百架的飛機，來攻擊「拉巴爾」，不過每次常受很大的損害，這是諸位看見戰况發表，想早已知道的。</p>
<p>因為在逍方面的戰局，對我方很有利，敵方不能推進再有利的反攻，所以勉强維持現在的戰綫，而入於膠着狀態了。我們可以如此觀察的。</p>
<p>等到了去年末，敵方這回在「吉爾貝特」諸島方面企圖反攻。不過因為我軍的善戰奮鬥，蒙受了莫大的損害，以後敵方增加兵力，以十倍我方的兵力來繼續猛攻，我方因為地距太遠，後援不如意縱續，結果全員都為國家壯列王碎了。</p>
<p>入了本年度敵方這回向「馬紹爾」羣島方面進來了。現在在該方面彼我兩軍正在繼續熾烈的戰鬥，兄弟本是在前年六月以至那年年底之間，在「馬紹爾一方面服務過的，所以稍微知道那邊的情形。一馬紹爾　羣島是由好幾百的小珊瑚礁而作成的，對於其中在戰　上比較重要的各島，則雖然　經具有嚴重的防備設施，但是對於所有的小島，一律施行同樣的防備，那可屬於極困難的事情。所以有的島只有監視員而已，有的連監　員也沒有，全無防衛設備的也不少。所以敵方一進攻到這些小島時，我們將他們擊退上感覺得非常的困難，所以免不了自然招來在羣島內兩方相持對抗，繼續戰鬥的情形。據兄弟想像，現在正已入於這樣的狀態了，各島都是離海面高不過數米，又低父平的小烏。島上就有椰子樹，以及其他雜不的繁茂，沒有一個可以利用攻防的小地丘崗，所以防禦戰鬥極感困難。我方勇士們在這個地形之下繼續苦戰的情形，兄弟好容易想像到的。</p>
<p>總之現在太平洋戰局在拉巴爾方面，因為敵方的反攻，完全被我方阻止，結果入於膠着狀態。每天就以激烈的空中戰為主，繼續戰鬥，而在馬紹爾方面則展開了小島攻防爭奪戰。不過這些小島上的戰鬥，决不會左右戰局大勢。</p>
<p>敵方這些作戰之目的，就是在把自從大東亞戰爭開始以來屢次慘敗，而喪失了的太平洋霸權奪回，僥望進攻日本本土，或者恢復「菲烏」，將戰爭的局面變成有利態勢，做他們達到世界制霸的非望為目的，而實行之反攻作戰的一部份。我們又可以明顯的看得出來，美國很焦盧的地方，美國因國內各種錯綜複雜的情形所迫不得已，圖以短期决戰，極力解决之方法。</p>
<p>那麼，美國以所企圖的反攻，能不能挽回頹勢，而達到戰爭的目的呢？關於此點，兄弟想要研究研究，我們先把美國的海軍戰力簡單的檢討一下。但是因為沒有最新的材料，所以關於最近的狀態不大明瞭，不過大約一年以前的情形是這樣的。（未完）</p>

<h3>主席訓詞</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　（續昨）淸鄉工作發動於三十年七月，國民政府實為主體，盟邦方面從而協力。最初目的在樹立局部和平，進而拓展全面和平。然自我國參戰以後，淸鄉工作更成為參戰義務之一，就戰爭全局而言，我國以處在後方之地位，而兼負有同於前綫之任務。蓋英美正在利用渝方軍隊，以牽制日本；正在嗾使匪共流寇，以破壤和平；正在假藉我國領土，作飛機根據地，以濫炸無辜平民。總其所為，無非仇視和平區域內之人民，欲構大東亞同胞自相殘殺之局。淸鄕工作最大目的，在保障和平區域之安全，亦即所以根結英美之流毒。以是之故，淸鄕工作對於完遂戰爭有其更深遠而重大意義。以言責任實當視同前錢，非徒鞏固後方而已，此為今後淸鄕工作之第一要義。今年一年為增產運動年，欲求生產增加，必先解除人民之痛苦，排除生逢之障碍。對於生產者，及其生產力，予以有力之保障培植，對搗亂生產，象肉人民之惡腐份子，予以撤底之肅淸。鄉民經濟僅存之元氣，不致再受摧殘，使人民生產之所得，不致橫被抽剝，而為人民所用。人民能安居樂業，乃測發揮其生產力，從事於增產，以此貢獻，使國計民生之改善，並以此貢獻於大東亞戰爭之完遂渝偽匪共禍國殃民，因當撲滅之不遺餘力，舉凡不良軍隊，不肖官吏，不法奸商，日惟營私舞弊，敲詐勒索，剝削中飽，囤積居奇，食民自肥者，皆為國計民生之　賊，憂即大東亞之叛逆，尤須摧陷而廓清之，此為今後清鄉工作第二要義。</p>
<p>余於清鄉工作發足點，即提出淸鄉必先淸心之口號，與國人共相策勵。良以淸鄉工作之根本，不僅為軍事上之掃蕩，抑且為恩想上門爭，不僅在治安上的確立，抑且在心理上的建設。為完成此建設性的鬥爭，淸鄉所至，必須使一般人民深切了解，英美為中國，為東亞之最大敵人。深切了解驅逐英美為中國人，為東亞人，共同的責任，而後能激發其决戰决勝之信念，堅定其興華保亞之决心。必須使一般人民深切了解英美勢力，澄淸社會萬惡，樹立廉潔政治，為復興東亞之前提，而後能不屈不撓，與惡勞力作殊死鬥爭必須使一般人民深切了解，自治自衛自力自養，為戰時安定社會，改善民生，效力國家之要着。而後能相與奮起，在政領導之下，各就本位，併力前進者，又為今後淸鄕工作之第三要義。</p>
<p>以上三點，僅就今後淸鄉工作舉其原則。至於具體方案，有待於本會議之詳細舉討。淸鄕機構應如何强化改進，行政院設置清鄉事務局以來，其任務重在計劃，各省清鄉事務局，應如何增益權責，以利進行。他如未淸鄕區如何拓展，已淸鄕區如何滲透，地方政治如何革新，社會經濟如何更生，目治團體如何建立，自衛力量如何充實。如何推進新運，如何訓練靑年，如何組織民衆，如何撫輯流亡，切望各本經騐，參酌地方現况，釐訂切實而可行之方案，一一付之實施。凡我將士百僚。暨我同胞，尤當明認主體之責任，積極邁進。務期　澈三年來淸鄕工作之本旨而無負盟邦友我助我之盛意，</p>

<p>赫爾辛基十一日中央社電　芬蘭人民黨喉舌「宋特報」昨於社論中力言，芬蘭有權根據自已之利益，以抉擇對美國務卿赫爾要求之態度。以吾人之意見而論，解决吾人問題惟一途徑，在繼續對蘇作戰，以待吾人之獨立與邊界有所保障時始止。凡獨立國人民有所决定時，繼不致違反白國之利益，因此如美所耍求，芬蘭本國行動準備負擔全責。</p>
<h3>歐洲要塞的攻防戰　朝日新聞座談會</h3>
<p>德國的觀測</p>
<p>朝日新聞社關於英美的第二戰綫，德國當然嚴重以待，試問柏林方面的觀測如何呢？</p>
<p>守山特派員（柏林）一月十九日的英國議會上，邱吉爾受到一個議員關於第二戰綫的查間，而答稱：</p>
<p>三月中旬前，諸君將目睹戰史上空前的大規模軍事行動。</p>
<p>這話暗示第二戰綫將在三月中旬開始。德方也預料第二戰綫是必至的，郭培爾在二十一日出版的大德意志雜誌上的論文中說：</p>
<p>我們毫不躊躇的承認敵的第二戰綫必將開始。</p>
<p>可見德方已獲有很有力的情報。此外，大部份的觀測，第二戰綫將在三，四月之間，也有一部份說在五月間，而始終沒有人說在六，七月間或秋季，這是很可注意的。至於塲所，如其不是最短距離的法國海岸，不能用百萬以上的大軍開闢眞正的第二戰綫。巴爾幹和挪威或許也有可能。以上是常識的看法。再看敵人對義大利所取的方法，從正面最短的距離堂堂皇皇進行攻擊。像此次這樣公然預先向全世界發表第二戰綫總司令官，暗示其時期，把全世界捲入烟務中。他舞想用這大胆的準備行　使德國陷於神經戰，孤注一擲，以决勝負。結果，第二戰紅對敵方勢必成為消耗戰。</p>
<p>而實行的時期，大體已吿决定，東部戰綫仍對峙於現在的一綫，德國國內的抵抗力尙健在，所以登陸軍不能不犧牲過半。但東部戰綫出現了更大的變化時，也就是第二戰綫開始登睦的信號，而必須片刻不懈的加以警戒。</p>
<p>說到德國方面，正歡迎英美登陸，反之，英美不在本年內開闢第二戰錢，在德國反感到不耐煩。第二戰綫在德國是賭生死的大决戰。在那危險的决戰中求得一條活路，曾不是德國唯一的期待，却是極大的期待，極大的願望。當然，全體國民正以最大的關心，傾聽希特勒「登陸敵軍必被擊落海中」的誓約。（翔：譯自二月二日至三日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>經濟界</p>
<h3>評言　銀錢業開始放款</h3>
<p>農歷年關大結東以來，因木市銀錢業曾暫停一般信用放款所形成的一片陰羅，現因銀錢業公會方弄已議抉開始放歡，預料不久又要放出一片睛光了。雖然，銀錢萊公會的决議，是對於舊有客戶素普信用而營正當之業務者，開始予以新放數，惟一般有欠無存之行號，則巳决定停止放款，袛是有存無欠之行號，即使認爲「素著信用」了，共業務之正當與否，似乎還是另外一個問題，因爲投機幸而成功者，固亦自居於有存無欠之列，其不幸而失敗者，當然是有欠無存了。</p>
<p>總之一句話，站在經濟的立塲，我們所期待於今年銀錢業開始放款以後的，不像一般人所認爲可喜的，是從此又復有錢囤貨了，又復股票看漲了，又復可以出入於聲色貨利之塲，用之不盡，取之不蜴了；我們的期待，是資金從此改變流通的道路，不要繼續成爲飄忽無定的游資，專向橫央的路上走去，那是要洪水汜濫的。換句話說，這樣一類無意義，無政策的「放款」，其危險直等於「决川」，民衆是終於要溺死其中的，並非我們言之過甚。我們鑒於上海銀行錢莊之多，其中財力充足，宗旨純正，實能爲社會負調劑金融，促進生產之責者，固亦不一而足，但此外許多銀行錢莊，其業務是否適合今日社會之需要，對於金融市塲是否有所貢獻，但須詳審其資金運用的方式，就可以知過半了。</p>
<h3>抑平物價工作　今後重在執行　當局已級及組成調查幹部</h3>
<p>最近一週來本市之物價，頗爲動盪，各種主要商品，平均上漲四五成不等；關係當局，對此寄予密切注視，仍本初衷，積極予以壓平。按木市百物售價，須經市物評議委員會評訂後才生效力，各業商人務絕對遵照，不准有絲毫逾限情事，同時各業如確因成本關係而須變更價格者，亦須經該會核准。記者頃自關係方面探悉，當局爲適應目前環境需要起見，對於壓平物價工作，今後將着重於執行方面，當局已組成健强調查幹部，逐日分赴界內各公司商店行號門市部密查，違法商人，一經查出，即須依法嚴懲，當局希望市民，隨時檢舉，市民如發現違法商店，可以口頭或書面函吿區公署，檢舉人姓氏，絕對守秘密，並予以獎動云。</p>

<h3>海軍　四號學生（九）</h3>
<p>— 岩田　豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>「兵學校這個地方，實在是好漂亮。」眞人有時候這樣地想着。不但是對於服裝，容儀，姿勢，動作，都嚴格的考究着，在到學生館來往的道路上，掛着連理髮店也沒有的大鏡面。倒好像是一個女學校似的。</p>
<p>個是眞人，也漸漸地明白那種敎養的眞意了。整頓和淸潔，並非是好漂亮，這是於軍紀上有重大的關係。整頓就可以使戰爭獲得勝利。淸潔就可以提高軍事的效率。服裝和容儀，是不可以輕視的。開着一個鈕扣，便是精神弛綏的證據。不但關係於海軍軍人的品格，同時將來要影響到戰鬥動作：</p>
<p>對於向敎官和上級生行敬禮，也是同樣的。若是不守規律的時候，將來要影響到命令系統的紊亂。萬一如此，就不可能作戰了。所以對上官要絕對尊敬，絕對服從。但是　人對這種敎養，並不感覺怎樣痛苦，因為對長幼有序，沒有比廠摩再嚴格的地方，所以從幼年時代就慣習了的—</p>
<p>再是，海軍的五分鐘以前的主義，眞人從自己的性格上也得到同感·他不像那悠然自適的鹿見鳥人。對於時間是相當嚴格的。與其指定正確的時問，不如五分鐘以前就到當塲，一來是絕對不會　誤，並且心中也有了很大的餘裕。這是要</p>
<p>眞人從入所以後，痛切地惑到時間的價値。從起床到就寢，沒有比這個　校再活用着時間的地方。</p>
<p>（十）</p>
<p>習慣於利用時間以後的　入，分出了早晨極少的時間，云參拜八方園神社。</p>
<p>八方園是學生們的勞作所拓成的東方的小丘，在種植着亭亭的松樹，和可憐的約櫻的平地上，正面奉祀着伊勢大神宮。左方的一個角落裹，有大理石的方位盤，白色的石面上，彫刻着黑色的自宮城以下的日本全國的方位。</p>
<p>眞人先參拜祝福，　拜宮城，然後向刻着鹿兒島的方向，靜默地垂下頭來。</p>
<p>（母親，早安……）想起來，眞是滿腔心事，但心裏所說的，祗是這樣一句。他的腦海裹，不時有今年六十一歲的母親的印象。母親雖然有了那麼一把年紀，但瘦瘠的身軀，像有鞭子在撻打一般，還在不斷的勞動着。想到那裹，再沒有酒店云的道理了。他在學四年，祗有二次踏進酒店的門。給學生的津貼，每月平均十圓，甩掉了四五圓已够了，因為不要麻煩母親的緣故。</p>
<p>而且在學校裹，除了通信費之外，幾毋須別的零用錢。敎科書和筆記簿不必說，被服，靴子，都是上等物，免費貸與。至於膳食，軍醫官和糧食委員很費一番心思，充分研究螢養和鮮味。朝餐的豆鼓湯也有肉湯，飯裹加麥粉，中膳，晚飯都有油炸魚，肉餅，牛排等西洋式的副食物。眞人向來吃粗羹淡飯長大起來的，所以吃到這種東西，担心或許不配胃口，但結果正相反對，體重漸漸的增加起來。此外，牡丹餅，羊羹，汁粉之類也常有。有汁粉時，用另一個　，在另一個烟突中出靑烟。學生們眼快，見到出靑烟，已經垂涎欲滴了。眞人的四號生時代，在中國事變前一年，如在現在，雖在兵學校中，也苦於砂糖和小豆的不足。</p>
<p>此外，還有俱樂部的設備。入校時暫寄的農家即為其一。學校當局在詳細調查家庭之後，在江田島各村租借民家。同一分隊的學生，在禮拜天乙聚集在那裹，或下將棋，或烹一剝燒一，過一天像家庭般的生活，使忘掉鄉愁。</p>
<p>但其中也有除了聊天之外，在井邊洗濯汚物而令人佩服的學生。眞人乙是其中之一，為了節省洗灌費，跼在四角的石　圈幷邊。</p>
<p>「谷……你是洗濯的名人·」有一個同樣是四號生的人這樣說。</p>
<p>「嗯……」眞人祗微笑着。想想了在故鄉也常常洗濯，而得到姊姊的褒獎。滿子姊姊，她們現在做些什麼呢——</p>
<p>社會服務</p>

<p>今天請諸位到此的意旨，顧南羣醫師已經說過，鄙人對頭先生的話，認為絕合羅輯，這里僅稍稍補充一下。在這一切都是科學化時代，醫學當然也是這樣，醫學愈研究愈複雜，不懂的地方也愈多，這是任何研究醫學者一致公認的事。因為這樣，所以診斷和治療方術，依現在科學程度論起來，錯誤地方難免的。但是錯誤是一件事，責備又是一件事。譬如梅毒的騐血，這個方法已經發明多時了，並且有相當的確實性。各國學者都已承認，已經流行地在那裹貫用，若是醫生對於梅毒病人沒有用過騐血方法，貿貿然否定是梅毒，竟把病人的前途耽誤了。這種錯誤，是應該受責備的。若是某種疾病，他的診斷法，還沒有正確發明，就責備起來，說道：「你為什麼不把這個病的診斷法發明呢？」這樣一來，醫生是太不容易做了，近來醫界和病人的糾紛，或者暴露上述觀念，還是別有深意，却不得而知。據鄙人看起來，滿肚皮對科學的不舒服，也許是一個主要的原因。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n39</h1>
<h3>Editorial: University Student Military Training</h3>
<p>Besides cultivating junior officers and superior soldiers, military training for university students inherently possesses three major significances: regulated training, physical exercise, and the enhancement of military knowledge. Regarding the issue of military training for university students, our ally Japan has recently demonstrated two major actions: one is the Ministry of Education's announcement on February 4th of the "Outline for Strengthening Military Education for Students," and the other is the "Implementation Rules for Naval Military Training Order" jointly formulated by the Navy and Ministry of Education on February 6th, deciding to dispatch active-duty naval officers to universities starting April 1st to conduct 30 hours of naval military training for students in their final year. The simultaneous attention given to this issue by the Army, Navy, and Ministry of Education, and the joint formulation of various regulations, demonstrates the importance of this matter.</p>
<p>Military training in China has a long history, especially in the years leading up to the 26th year of the Republic [1937], when schools across the country held military training, and summer vacations were even used for encampment training. The youth camps organized since the capital was relocated are also concrete microcosms of military training, but unfortunately, the scope is not large, the number of trainees is small, and it cannot be universally applied to schools in peaceful areas. Moreover, on-campus military training in various schools does not seem to be fully implemented. We hope that the Army, Navy, and Education Ministries of the National Government in Nanjing will follow the example of our ally Japan, and jointly formulate an immediately feasible military training program.</p>
<p>University students are the nation's vitality. However, when it comes to Chinese university students, besides a small number who are diligent and frugal, most are unknowingly embarking on a path of decadence due to the instability of the environment. We have directly seen or indirectly heard about many instances of the degeneration of university students. But when we think that in ten or twenty years, these young people will rise to assume national affairs, we truly "shudder with fear" for the future of the country. Comparing today's university students with those of the past, everyone can see the irregularity of their lives, the weakness of their physique, and the lack of general knowledge. The reasons for this do not lie entirely with the students. Military training can promote regularity in life, military training can foster physical health, and although military training can only increase military common sense, a student with a regular life and a strong body will naturally find it easier to absorb and improve in general coursework. Therefore, the purpose of military training, even without mentioning the training of officers and soldiers, has great benefits for the students themselves.</p>
<p>Now is the time of the Greater East Asia War, and this year in particular is the decisive year. War is a great testing ground for the whole world; what is suitable for war will naturally survive, and what is not suitable will naturally be eliminated. War is like a huge alchemical furnace, burning with immense flames. A nation of true gold is not afraid of intense flames, and only a people of true gold can forge a nation of true gold.</p>
<p>After Japan announced the Outline for Military Education on February 4th, Nasu, the director of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau, stated that this was the implementation of a combined military-civilian education. A combined military-civilian education is wartime education, an education suited to the wartime system. We hope that our authorities "should adopt what ought to be adopted." (Quoting Prime Minister Tojo)</p>
<h3>Japan Celebrates National Foundation Day, Holds Distant Worship Ceremony at the Imperial Palace, Emperor Bestows Silver Vases on Eight Groups</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency, 11th – Today, the National Foundation Day, holds profound significance under Japan's decisive battle. This morning, all 100 million Japanese citizens reverently worshiped the Imperial Palace and Yasukuni Shrine from afar, vowing their determination to win and praying for the continued success of the Japanese military. At 9:00 AM, all agencies and factories held distant worship ceremonies at the Imperial Palace, silently praying for the enhancement of combat power and victory. His Majesty the Emperor also bestowed silver vases on this day upon outstanding social enterprises and central business associations of foundations with remarkable achievements, as well as eight other groups. In addition, a monetary gift was given to each of the 925 outstanding private social enterprises nationwide. Simultaneously, the third National Excellent Town Council and Village Council Commendation Ceremony, hosted by the Ministry of Home Affairs' Central Autonomous Promotion Association, was held separately in prefectures and counties, with 46 excellent town councils and 47 village councils receiving commendations. The Labor Medal Conferment Ceremony was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Commendation for the Achievements of Shibasaki and Others, Conferring Ranks and Medals, Simultaneously Announced by the Japanese Navy Ministry's Bureau of Honors</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency, 11th – The Japanese Navy Ministry and the Bureau of Honors simultaneously announced at 3:00 PM on the 11th that His Majesty the Emperor, in recognition of the achievements of Vice Admiral Keiji Shibasaki, Colonel Yasuo Sato, and Colonel Yoshitada Yasuda, has specially conferred promotions and medals upon them. According to this promotion to Vice Admiral, Second Class Merit, and Second Order Rising Sun, Vice Admiral Shibasaki Keiji valiantly resisted when a large enemy force landed on the Gilbert Islands on November 21st of last year, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and constantly containing the enemy's strong reinforcements, resulting in fierce air battles over the waters near the Gilbert Islands. He defended for five days, ultimately fighting to the last man, and his entire force gloriously perished. His great achievements will endure as long as heaven and earth. In addition, Colonel Yasuo Sato, promoted to Major General, Third Class Merit, and Second Order Rising Sun, served as commander of a destroyer fleet at the start of the war, participating in 27 battles, always leading from the front, capturing enemy positions, and repeatedly achieving great feats. He gloriously died in action in the waters off New Guinea in early March of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943]. Furthermore, Colonel Yoshitada Yasuda, also promoted to Major General, Second Class Merit, and Second Order Rising Sun, since mid-November of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], was in New Guinea, and at Buna was surrounded by the enemy, but refused to yield, urging his subordinates to cooperate with the army and achieve great results with few soldiers. He finally led a dozen or so subordinates into enemy lines on January 2nd of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943] and died gloriously. The Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet and the Chief of the Naval General Staff, upon hearing the news of the heroic fighting of Yasuda's unit, sent an inspiring message. This is the sixth time that naval officers have been promoted two ranks, and Colonels Sato and Yasuda are the first lieutenant colonels to be promoted to general.</p>
<h3>Celebration by Japanese Residents in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 11th – Today, the 11th, is the 2604th anniversary of the founding of Japan. Japanese residents in Nanjing, as well as shops, banks, companies, schools, groups, and organizations, all displayed flags in celebration and took a day off. At 9:00 AM, during the national celebration time, all residents performed distant worship ceremonies at the Imperial Palace at their respective locations. At 2:00 PM, the physical education department of the Revive Asia Patriotic Association held an armed cross-country relay race to strengthen the minds and bodies of the residents, and a National Foundation Day celebration concert was held at the First National School.</p>
<h3>Former Lieutenant General Maeda's Lecture: The Pacific War Situation – At the Rural Pacification Conference</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing – Former Lieutenant General Maeda delivered a lecture yesterday (the 10th) at the Rural Pacification Conference, titled "On the Current War Situation in the Pacific and the War Potential of the United States," explaining in great detail. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>It is an honor for me to be able to participate in the Rural Pacification Conference and have this opportunity to share some of my thoughts with you all.</p>
<p>I will first focus on the naval-related war situation at the current stage, and then briefly discuss the war potential of the United States. If it can be of some reference to you, it would be my greatest honor. However, I must first apologize for the fact that I have not received detailed reports on the battle situation here, so what I am going to talk about today is based on general publications. I am afraid that it cannot fully satisfy the specific inquiries of you all, and I ask for your understanding in advance.</p>
<p>The most intense battles currently unfolding in the Pacific are in the Marshall Islands area and the Rabaul area, as you all know. Rabaul was occupied by the Imperial Army in one fell swoop in late January of Showa 17, or the 31st year of the Republic [1942], after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. It has since been used as a strategic base for operations against the Solomon Islands, eastern New Guinea, and the east coast of Australia, and is heavily fortified and guarded. When we further advanced our offensive operations, we captured all of the Solomon Islands up to Guadalcanal, as well as eastern New Guinea. When we were about to pressure Port Moresby, the enemy was greatly alarmed by this situation. They concentrated their powerful forces in this area as much as possible and launched a tenacious counter-offensive in an attempt to reverse their disadvantage. This was what happened in June and July of the year before last. Since then, bitter and fierce battles have unfolded repeatedly on land, sea, and air, and we have achieved great victories each time, as you all know. However, there are often difficulties with the supply of these battles. If the forces are too dispersed, the supply feels even more difficult, so the guidance of the overall strategy is inevitably subject to various disadvantages. Therefore, we are observing the progress of the war situation and gradually shortening the front lines according to the requirements of the overall strategy. Now, with Rabaul as the center, we are heavily fortifying and guarding "New Britain" Island, "New Ireland Island," the majority of "Bougainville" Island, and the north coast of "New Guinea," and are effectively preventing the enemy's fierce counter-offensive. The enemy is attacking Rabaul with hundreds of aircraft every day, but each time they suffer great damage, as you must have already known from seeing the war situation reports.</p>
<p>Because the war situation in that area is very favorable to us, the enemy cannot advance a further advantageous counter-offensive, so they are forcibly maintaining the current front line and have entered a stalemate. We can observe it this way.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the enemy attempted a counter-offensive in the Gilbert Islands. However, due to the skillful fighting and struggle of our army, they suffered enormous damage. Later, the enemy increased their forces and continued to attack fiercely with ten times our strength. Because the distance was too far and the support was not as desired, our entire force gloriously perished for the country.</p>
<p>This year, the enemy has entered the Marshall Islands. Currently, fierce battles are continuing between our two armies in that area. I myself served in the Marshall Islands from June of the year before last to the end of that year, so I know the situation there a little. The Marshall Islands are made up of hundreds of small coral reefs. Although the islands that are relatively important in battle have serious defense facilities, it would be extremely difficult to implement the same defense for all the small islands. So some islands only have observers, and some do not even have observers, and there are many with no defense equipment at all. So when the enemy attacks these small islands, we feel very difficult to repel them, so it is inevitable that the two sides will confront and continue to fight in the archipelago. According to my imagination, it is already in such a state. All the islands are no more than a few meters above sea level, and they are low and flat. There are coconut trees and other miscellaneous plants, and there is no small hill that can be used for attack and defense, so defensive battles are extremely difficult. I can easily imagine the situation in which our brave soldiers continue to fight hard under this terrain.</p>
<p>In short, in the Pacific war situation, the enemy's counter-offensive in the Rabaul area was completely stopped by us, resulting in a stalemate. Fierce air battles continue to be the main focus every day, while small island battles are unfolding in the Marshall Islands. However, these battles on small islands will not affect the overall war situation.</p>
<p>The purpose of the enemy's operations is to regain the Pacific hegemony that they have repeatedly suffered disastrous defeats and lost since the start of the Greater East Asia War, hoping to attack the Japanese mainland or recover "the Philippines," and turn the war situation into an advantageous situation, in order to achieve their non-ambition of world domination. We can also clearly see that the United States is very anxious, and the United States is forced by various complex domestic situations, trying to resolve the situation as much as possible with a short-term decisive battle.</p>
<p>So, can the counter-offensive attempted by the United States reverse the decline and achieve the purpose of the war? Regarding this point, I want to study it. Let us first briefly review the naval power of the United States. However, because there is no latest material, the recent situation is not very clear, but the situation about a year ago was like this. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Chairman's Admonition</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) (Continued from yesterday) The Clean-up Campaign (淸鄉工作) was launched in July of the 30th year (1941). The National Government was the main actor, with Allied nations providing assistance. The initial objective was to establish local peace, and then to expand to comprehensive peace. However, since our country's entry into the war, the Clean-up Campaign has become one of the obligations of participating in the war. From the perspective of the overall war situation, our country, while in the rear, also bears the same tasks as the front lines. This is because Britain and the United States are using the Chongqing (渝) troops to contain Japan; instigating bandit communists to undermine peace; and using our country's territory as an air base to indiscriminately bomb innocent civilians. In short, all their actions are nothing more than to antagonize the people in the peaceful areas, intending to create a situation where the brothers of the Greater East Asia kill each other. The greatest goal of the Clean-up Campaign is to ensure the safety of the peaceful areas, which is also the way to eradicate the poison of Britain and the United States. Therefore, the Clean-up Campaign has a more profound and significant meaning for the completion of the war. In terms of responsibility, it should be regarded as the same as the front lines, not just to consolidate the rear. This is the first essential point for the Clean-up Campaign going forward. This year is the year of the Increased Production Movement (增產運動年). To seek increased production, we must first relieve the people's suffering and remove obstacles to their livelihoods. For producers and their productivity, we must provide strong guarantees and cultivation. For those evil elements who disrupt production and harm the people, we must thoroughly eliminate them. The last bit of vitality of the rural economy must not be further devastated, and the people's production income must not be plundered, but be used for the people. If the people can live and work in peace, they can unleash their productivity and engage in increased production, contributing to the improvement of the national economy and the people's livelihood, and contributing to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. The Chongqing (渝) puppet communist bandits harm the country and the people and should be eradicated with every effort. All bad troops, unworthy officials, illegal merchants, who only seek private gain, engage in malfeasance, extort, exploit, embezzle, hoard and speculate, and fatten themselves at the expense of the people, are all traitors to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and are even rebels against the Greater East Asia. They must be crushed and cleared away. This is the second essential point for the Clean-up Campaign going forward.</p>
<p>At the starting point of the Clean-up Campaign, I put forward the slogan of "Cleaning the Country must first Clean the Mind" (淸鄉必先淸心), to encourage the people. The foundation of the Clean-up Campaign is not only military suppression, but also ideological competition; not only the establishment of public security, but also psychological construction. To complete this constructive struggle, the Clean-up Campaign must make the general public deeply understand that Britain and the United States are the greatest enemies of China and East Asia. They must deeply understand that expelling Britain and the United States is the common responsibility of the Chinese people and the East Asian people, and then they can stimulate their belief in decisive victory and determination to revitalize China and protect Asia. The general public must deeply understand that the elimination of the forces of Britain and the United States, the purification of all social evils, and the establishment of clean government are prerequisites for the revival of East Asia. Then they can be unyielding and engage in a life-and-death struggle with evil forces. The general public must deeply understand that self-governance, self-defense, self-reliance, and self-sufficiency are essential for stabilizing society, improving people's livelihood, and serving the country in wartime. Then they can rise up together, under the leadership of the government, each in their own position, and advance together. This is the third essential point for the Clean-up Campaign going forward.</p>
<p>The above three points only mention the principles of the Clean-up Campaign going forward. As for the specific plans, they await the detailed discussion of this conference. How should the Clean-up Campaign organization be strengthened and improved? Since the establishment of the Clean-up Campaign Affairs Bureau by the Executive Yuan, its mission has been focused on planning. How should the Clean-up Campaign Affairs Bureaus of the provinces increase their powers and responsibilities to facilitate their work? Other issues include how to expand the areas that have not been cleaned, how to infiltrate the areas that have been cleaned, how to reform local politics, how to revitalize the social economy, how to establish self-governance organizations, how to strengthen self-defense forces, how to promote the New Life Movement, how to train youth, how to organize the people, and how to comfort and resettle refugees. It is hoped that all will draw on their experience, take into account the local situation, and formulate practical and feasible plans, and implement them one by one. All my generals and officials, and my compatriots, must clearly recognize the responsibility of the main entity, and actively advance. We must strive to thoroughly understand the original purpose of the Clean-up Campaign over the past three years, and live up to the great intentions of our allied friends who have helped us.</p>

<h3>The Fortress Warfare in Europe, Asahi Shimbun Roundtable Discussion</h3>
<p>German Observations</p>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun asked about the German perspective on the Anglo-American second front, which Germany is undoubtedly taking seriously. What are the observations in Berlin?</p>
<p>Special Correspondent Moriyama (Berlin) In the British Parliament on January 19th, Churchill was questioned by a member about the second front and replied:</p>
<p>Before mid-March, you will witness the largest military operation in the history of warfare.</p>
<p>This statement suggests that the second front will begin in mid-March. The German side also anticipates that the second front is inevitable. Goebbels said in an article in the January 21st issue of the "Das Reich" magazine:</p>
<p>We unhesitatingly admit that the enemy's second front will begin.</p>
<p>It is clear that the German side has obtained very strong intelligence. In addition, most observations point to the second front being launched between March and April, while some say it will be in May, but no one says it will be in June, July or autumn, which is noteworthy. As for the location, unless it is the shortest distance, the French coast, a real second front cannot be opened with a million or more troops. The Balkans and Norway may also be possible. These are common-sense views. Looking at the method the enemy is taking against Italy, attacking head-on from the shortest distance. By openly announcing the commander-in-chief of the second front to the whole world in advance, hinting at its timing, and involving the whole world in a smoke screen, he wants to use this bold preparation to plunge Germany into a war of nerves, betting everything to decide the outcome. As a result, the second front will inevitably become a war of attrition for the enemy.</p>
<p>The timing of the implementation has largely been decided. The Eastern Front remains in confrontation on the current line. The German domestic resistance is still intact, so the landing forces cannot avoid sacrificing more than half of their strength. However, when a greater change occurs on the Eastern Front, it will be the signal for the start of the second front, and constant vigilance is necessary.</p>
<p>As far as Germany is concerned, it is welcoming an Anglo-American landing. Conversely, if the Anglo-Americans do not open a second front this year, Germany will become impatient. The second front is a decisive battle to the death for Germany. Seeking a way out of that dangerous decisive battle is not Germany's only expectation, but a great expectation and a great desire. Of course, the entire nation is listening with the utmost concern to Hitler's vow that "the landing enemy will be shot down into the sea." (翔: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun from February 2nd to 3rd)</p>

<h3>Decisive Measures to be Taken Against Manipulating Gold Speculators, Authorities Determined to Strictly Crack Down to Stabilize People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: The recent surge in gold prices has been like wildfire, enough to stimulate a sharp rise in various commodity prices. The reason is that a few unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai have been manipulating the market to seek exorbitant profits. In view of this, the municipal authorities, in order to thoroughly suppress prices and stabilize the people's livelihood, have resolutely arrested 200 speculators who have been manipulating gold prices, and will severely punish them. After this head-on blow, unscrupulous merchants have become wary, and gold prices have stabilized yesterday. It is believed that the price of gold will fall after this large-scale crackdown on speculators, and that commodity prices will also stabilize as a result. A Central News Agency reporter visited the person in charge of the financial authorities yesterday to inquire about their views. According to them, the recent gold transactions have gone far beyond the norm. The reason is that speculators have had wild ideas and are once again using gold as a target for speculation and profit-making. The impact of this is enough to disrupt the financial system and stimulate commodity prices. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood, the authorities will continue to pay close attention in the future. If there are any who disregard the law and deliberately manipulate the market, decisive measures will be taken and strict crackdowns will be carried out. It is hoped that all merchants will be clear about their goals and will not lightly step into the legal net.</p>
<p>Gold Speculators to be Prosecuted</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: Recently, unscrupulous speculators have disregarded the law, again using gold as a target for speculation and hoarding, deliberately manipulating the market and engaging in black market gold transactions, which is enough to stimulate a sharp rise in commodity prices. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood and suppress commodity prices, the authorities made the greatest determination and took decisive measures. On the morning of the 10th, detectives were dispatched to various black market gold trading places to carry out arrests, which has aroused great attention from society. It is learned that the 218 people arrested this time will be handed over to the local police station for prosecution after separate investigations, and then handled by the court. It is also reported that the authorities will take similar measures against transactions that are sufficient to stimulate commodity prices.</p>
<h3>Our Newspaper Holds Tea Party to Welcome Professor Nakayama, Exchanging Opinions on Sino-Japanese Issues on the Spot</h3>

<h3>Measures for Pregnant Women to Apply for Brown Sugar to be Announced</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: Brown sugar is a necessity for lying-in women. Since its sale was suspended, the public has had a great need for it. There have been sales of counterfeit brown sugar mixed with gypsum in the Guangdong Road area. According to inquiries by a Central News Agency reporter, the Economic Department of the First District Public Office and the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Sales Office have decided to adopt the method of designating retail stores to sell it on their behalf in order to alleviate the purchasing difficulties of pregnant women and to prevent pregnant women from purchasing counterfeit sugar, which may affect their health. Being able to widely sell brown sugar is the best way to eliminate counterfeit sugar. All pregnant women who are more than nine months pregnant can apply, one jin per woman. The detailed measures will be officially announced in the next few days. It is reported that the Municipal Food Bureau in the urban area will also adopt this method and handle it in the same way to protect the health of lying-in women throughout the city. However, before the measures are announced, pregnant women need not apply to the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Sales Office again, so as not to make futile trips.</p>

The amount of sugar sold is calculated as five liang per person, and the price is eight yuan and one jiao.</p>

<h3>Black Market Rice Prices Skyrocket, Hoping to Increase Rationed Rice to Lessen Impact on People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: Since the announcement last week that the amount of rice and flour that can be carried is limited to kilograms, black market rice prices in the city have skyrocketed, threatening the people's livelihood. After the authorities adjusted the amount of rationed rice and flour in the city, it has increased compared to the previous period. However, two sheng per person per period is still not enough to eat. The 5 million citizens of the city are eagerly hoping that the amount of rationed rice will be increased to three sheng per person per period, plus rationed flour, so that they can barely make ends meet and do not have to rely on the black market. It is also hoped that the Food Bureau will not reduce or delay the amount of rationed rice and flour in the future.</p>

<h3>Hard Work and Charity Performance: Double Happiness at the Door, Only Five Days Left, Robot is Well Prepared</h3>
<p>The New Year program "Double Happiness at the Door," a comedy about gender issues, by the Kugan Theater Troupe for charity, has been warmly welcomed by young men and women since its premiere at the Paris Grand Theater. Now, according to the planned schedule, the Kugan is about to change its repertoire, and there are only five days left for "Double Happiness at the Door." Hopefully, young lovers will not miss this most important lesson in the philosophy of love!</p>
<p>This year's scholarship campaign has been particularly successful, and as the spring semester begins at various schools, the Kugan is about to contribute a highly inspiring ideal play - "Robot." The play is based on the original work by Xia Peike, adapted through collective discussion by many people, and directed by Shi Hui. The play depicts the world five hundred years in the future, the thoughts and emotions of humans at that time, all aspects of life, and the degree of progress in material civilization. There are profound and interesting descriptions here.</p>
<p>The architecture, clothing, and utensils of five hundred years from now are of course very different from the present, especially since "Robot" describes the situation on Mars. Therefore, the costumes, props, and sets are specially designed by experts and put into production after a long period of research. Currently, a large number of skilled workers are being hired to rush the production day and night. The enormous cost of "Robot," the novelty of the design, and the richness of the script's imagination will all set a new record for the drama world, and will refresh the audience's senses. The play is determined to be presented grandly after "Double Happiness at the Door."</p>
<p>Economic Affairs</p>
<h3>Commentary: Money Shops Begin Lending</h3>
<p>Since the end of the Lunar New Year holiday, the gloom formed by the temporary suspension of general credit lending by money shops in this city is now expected to dissipate soon, as the Money Shops Association has resolved to begin lending. However, the resolution of the Money Shops Association is to begin issuing new loans to existing customers with good credit and legitimate businesses. For companies with outstanding debts and no savings, it has been decided to stop lending. Even for companies with savings and no debts that are considered to have "established credit," whether their businesses are legitimate seems to be another question. Those who succeed in speculation consider themselves to have savings and no debts, while those who unfortunately fail naturally have debts and no savings.</p>
<p>In a word, from an economic point of view, what we expect from the resumption of lending by money shops this year is not, as most people think, a return to money hoarding goods, a rise in stock prices, and endless access to pleasure and profit. Our expectation is that capital will change its circulation path from now on, ceasing to be volatile, aimless floating capital, and ceasing to move recklessly along the road to disaster, which will lead to a flood. In other words, this kind of meaningless, unprincipled "lending" is as dangerous as "opening a river," and the people will eventually drown in it. We are not exaggerating. Given the large number of banks and money shops in Shanghai, some of which are financially sound, have pure objectives, and can truly assume the responsibility of regulating finance and promoting production for society, but for many other banks and money shops, whether their business is suitable for today's social needs, and whether they contribute to the financial market, one can know more than half the truth by carefully examining how they use their funds.</p>
<h3>Efforts to Suppress and Stabilize Prices: Emphasis on Implementation Going Forward, Authorities Have Begun to Form Investigation Cadres</h3>
<p>In the past week, prices in the city have been quite volatile, with various major commodities rising by an average of 40% to 50%. The relevant authorities are paying close attention to this and are actively working to suppress and stabilize prices, remaining true to their original intentions. According to regulations, the sales prices of all goods in the city must take effect after being evaluated and approved by the Municipal Price Evaluation Committee. Businesses in all industries must strictly comply and are not allowed to exceed the limits in any way. At the same time, if any industry needs to change prices due to cost reasons, it must also be approved by the committee. The reporter recently learned from relevant sources that, in order to adapt to the needs of the current environment, the authorities will focus on the implementation aspect of price suppression and stabilization going forward. The authorities have formed a strong investigation cadre that will secretly investigate various companies, shops, firms, and retail departments in the city every day. Merchants who violate the law will be severely punished according to the law once they are discovered. The authorities hope that citizens will report violations at any time. If citizens discover stores that violate the law, they can report them verbally or in writing to the district office. The names of the reporters will be kept strictly confidential, and they will be rewarded.</p>
<h3>Oil and Grain Special Committee: Collecting Raw Materials</h3>
<p>The Oil and Grain Special Committee of the National General Chamber of Commerce, in view of the recent rise in black market prices for edible oil, will improve the quantity and dates of future allocations. To achieve this goal, the committee will intensify its procurement efforts. A batch of edible oil previously ordered from North China has now arrived in Shanghai in its entirety. At the same time, it is also collecting oilseed raw materials on a large scale from various producing areas in the three provinces to be distributed to various factories to accelerate production.</p>
<h3>Seven New Stocks: Continued Approval for Listing, Decided at the Seventh Standing Committee Meeting of the Supervisory Committee</h3>

The following important matters were resolved: Seven stocks were approved to continue listing; the rest will be discussed at the next meeting. The General Affairs and Audit groups submitted reports on the limit of stock price increases, which will be reviewed separately by the committee members before being submitted for discussion at the next meeting. The exchange's request to revise the principles for reviewing stocks for listing and the request to revise the procedures for listing stocks will continue to be handled according to the original procedures. The meeting adjourned at around 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Trend of Excessive Selling Has Subsided, and the Shanghai Stock Market Has Slightly Improved</h3>

<h3>Navy No. 4 Student (9)</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>"This place, the Naval Academy, is truly beautiful." Masato thinks this sometimes. Not only are clothing, appearance, posture, and actions rigorously examined, but on the roads to and from the student hall, there are large mirrors that even barbershops don't have. It's almost like a girls' school.</p>
<p>Masato is also gradually understanding the true meaning of that kind of education. Tidiness and cleanliness are not just for beauty; they have a significant relationship with military discipline. Tidiness can lead to victory in war. Cleanliness can improve military efficiency. Clothing and appearance cannot be taken lightly. An unbuttoned button is evidence of lax spirit. It is not only related to the character of naval personnel but will also affect combat actions in the future.</p>
<p>The same applies to saluting instructors and upperclassmen. If regulations are not followed, it will affect the disorder of the command system in the future. If this happens, combat will be impossible. Therefore, superiors must be absolutely respected and absolutely obeyed. However, Masato doesn't feel much pain from this kind of education because there is no place more strict about the order of seniority than the shipyard, so he has been accustomed to it since childhood—</p>
<p>Furthermore, Masato feels the same way about the Navy's "five minutes earlier" principle. He is not like the leisurely Rokumi Tori. He is quite strict about time. Rather than specifying the exact time, it is better to arrive at the scene five minutes earlier. On the one hand, there will be absolutely no mistakes, and on the other hand, there will be plenty of time in the heart. This is what is needed</p>
<p>Since entering the school, Masato has deeply felt the value of time. From getting up to going to bed, there is no place that utilizes time more effectively than this school.</p>
<p>(Ten)</p>
<p>After getting used to using time, Masato set aside very little time in the morning to visit the Happo-en Shrine.</p>
<p>Happo-en is a small hill in the east, developed by the students' labor. On the flat ground planted with tall pine trees and pitiful sakura trees, the Ise Grand Shrine is enshrined in front. In a corner to the left, there is a marble orientation plate, with the directions of Japan from the Imperial Palace and below carved in black on the white stone surface.</p>
<p>Masato first worshipped and blessed, worshiped the Imperial Palace, and then silently lowered his head towards the direction of Kagoshima, which was carved on the plate.</p>
<p>(Mother, good morning...) Thinking about it, my heart is full of things, but what I said in my heart was just this sentence. The impression of his sixty-one-year-old mother often comes to his mind. Although his mother is so old, her thin body is constantly working as if she were being whipped. Thinking of that, there is no reason to go to hotels anymore. In his four years of study, he only entered the door of the hotel twice. The allowance for students averages ten yuan per month, and four or five yuan is enough, because I don’t want to bother my mother.</p>
<p>Moreover, in school, apart from communication expenses, there is almost no need for other pocket money. Textbooks and notebooks are not to mention, clothing and boots are all top-quality items, provided free of charge. As for the meals, the military medical officer and the food committee take great pains to fully study the nutrition and freshness. The miso soup for breakfast also has meat broth, and wheat flour is added to the rice. Western-style side dishes such as fried fish, meatloaf, and steak are served for lunch and dinner. Masato has always grown up eating coarse food, so he was worried that he might not be able to eat such things, but the result was just the opposite, and his weight gradually increased. In addition, botamochi, yokan, and zenzai are also common. When there is zenzai, use another cauldron, and green smoke comes out of another chimney. The students are quick to spot it, and when they see green smoke coming out, they are already drooling. Masato's time as a No. 4 student was one year before the China Incident. As it is now, even in military schools, they are suffering from a shortage of sugar and azuki beans.</p>
<p>In addition, there are club facilities. One of them is the farmhouse where students are temporarily lodged when they enter the school. After thoroughly investigating the families, the school authorities rent private houses in each village of Etajima. Students in the same platoon gather there on Sundays, or play shogi, or cook a pot of something, and spend a day like a family, forgetting their homesickness.</p>
<p>But among them, there are also students who, in addition to chatting, wash dirty things by the well and are admirable. Masato is also one of them, squatting by the four-cornered stone well to save washing fees.</p>
<p>"Tani... you are a laundry expert." One of the other No. 4 students said this.</p>
<p>"Um..." Masato just smiled. I thought about how I often did laundry in my hometown and received praise from my sister. Sister Mitsuko, what are they doing now——</p>

<h3>Speech by Medical Representatives at a Reception for the Press, by Yu Yunxiu</h3>
<p>Dr. Gu Nanqun has already stated the purpose of inviting you all here today. I believe that Mr. Tou's words are perfectly logical, and I will only add a little here. In this era where everything is scientific, medicine is of course also scientific. The more medicine is researched, the more complex it becomes, and the more places that are not understood. This is a consensus among all medical researchers. Because of this, diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, based on the current level of science, are inevitably prone to errors. However, error is one thing, and blame is another. For example, the syphilis blood test, this method has been invented for a long time and has considerable certainty. Scholars from various countries have recognized it and have been using it widely. If a doctor has not used the blood test method for a syphilis patient and rashly denies that it is syphilis, thus delaying the patient's future, this kind of error should be blamed. If a certain disease has not yet had a correct diagnostic method invented, and blame is laid, saying, "Why don't you invent the diagnostic method for this disease?" In this way, doctors would be too difficult to be, recently, the disputes between the medical community and patients, or the exposure of the above-mentioned concepts, may have other deeper meanings, but it is not known. In my opinion, a belly full of discomfort with science may be a major reason.</p>
