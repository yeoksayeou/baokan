<h3>戰時官紀與信賞必罰</h3>
<p>日本於法年火月決定强化國　態勢方策，以適應大束亞戰爭決戰階段的迫切需要，其中最重要的實踐步驟之一，就是「行政運營決戰化一，爲求進一步的整肅官紀而採取必要的措置，因此又於去年十二月二十一日內閣會議中正式决定四項勅令，於今年一月四日公佈，規定即日實施，藉以加强信賞必罰制度，强化國內決戰熊　，完遂大東亞戰爭，這四項勒令，包括：　戰時官吏服務令，　文官懲戒戰時特例，　各種職員危　或退官時之任用等特例，　警察及救活隊員懲戒戰時特例。（見今日本報第二版）綜觀這四項勅令的主旨，十就在對於戰時官吏重申信賞必罰的精神，所以其中心可說是戰時官吏服務令，這些勅令中明確地指示戰時官吏篤踐躬行的具體事項，明定罰罪賞功的切實辦法，雖然都是針對盟邦日本目前的內外實情而決定的，然而對於今日政府對於公務人員也不無參酌引用的意義。</p>
<p>國府自還都以來，政府所謀者，無非在求和平區內治安之恢復與確保，尤其在求政治上軌道。自參戰以來，我國對於完遂大東亞戰爭所負的責任更艱重了，正如我們所一向不辭焦唇敝舌而進言的，無論是要求實踐的參戰的義務，無論是要求實現新統一局面，其唯一的前提是要求政治上軌道，要求政治上有辦法，也就是要求提高政治的效率。因爲只有政治上實現了這些要求，那麼確保治安乃至協力對英美作戰，經濟上的增强生產以內安民生外助盟邦，纔有了可靠的保證。然而政治上這些要求之實現，或是說戰時政治體制之完全確立與夫一切戰時政策綱領的澈底實踐，在我們中國，「不患無治法而患無治人」，所以更應該特別注力於愼選賢能，整肅官紀，加强信賞必罰制度。因此，我們更應重視日本政府此次肅正官紀的勅令之內容。</p>
<p>日本此次四項肅正官紀勅令中，明確規定必須一心一德躬踐實行的戰時官吏七項訓誡中，特別値得我政府諸領袖以及一般公務人員重視的，如第三項：官吏於戰時，特別對部下，明示其應走的方向，而以身先統率指導。第五項：官吏於戰時，以特別入微之精神，體察民情，務須精誠親愛任事。以及第六項：官吏於戰時，特別重視廉潔風氣，以修身齊家，率先重範，努力爲社會楷模。這裏充分表示出戰時官吏必須特別體察民隱，尊重民意，必須特別廉潔；必須對任何事以身作則，都爲我們所一再獻言而爲國民政府政治修明的先決條件。此外，對於違反戰時官箴的應如何予以特別嚴厲的懲罰，對於忠守官箴因而致疾，毀家，乃至犧牲生命的應如何特別從優獎勵，在我國都是急待明確規定的。</p>
<p>「名不正則言不順，言不順則事不行」，我們敬佩日木政府加强信賞必罰制度的新勅令，我們更竭誠期待政府當局更進而遂酌我國今日之實情，明確規定戰時官吏的服務規則和毅然實踐信賞必罰制度，明是非，重輿論，羅致眞才，修明政治，然後足以實踐參戰建國的任務。</p>
<h3>八十四屆議會中日首相施政演說對決戰下重責決全力完成</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日第八十四屆議會鞏固必勝信念，加强切决戰施策，已於二十一日再開。上午十時貴族院召開全體會試，由日東條目相發表一般施政方針演說，重光外相發表外交演說後，即商討政府提出之法案，並由關係大臣予以說明，分別將各法案委託各委員會審議，正午散會。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央赴電　日衆議院於二十一日午後一時起，舉行　全體會議，與貴院同首由東條首相及重外相發表演說，繼由賀屋藏相發表財政演說，旋由政府方而答辭前田房之助，木暮武太夫兩氏之質問，嗣於五時四十五分散會。</p>
<h3>東條首相演詞全文</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日內閣總理大臣東條英機氏，於二十一日第八十四屆議會再開時，發表施政演說，茲誌其原詞如次。前次議會舉行揭幕典禮時，辱蒙天皇陛下特賜優渥勒語，洵堪恐懼感激不已，余謹願與諸君奉戴聖旨，頃全力完成决戰下之羞大職責，即速達成作戰目的，以安聖慮。回顧大東亞戰爭勃發以來，已二年有餘，皇軍將士，於御稜威之下，善謀勇戰，繼續奮　，余於此願與諸君同向前綫奮關中之將士致謝，爲陣亡勇士致悼，對其遣族衷心表示同情，並爲傷兵將士康復致視，最後，余更願與諸君對後方爲爭取勝利而繼續奮頤中之國民深致敬意。綜觀大東亞之戲局，敵方之反攻，最近愈趨熾烈，彼等雖一再遭受重創，但一味恃其物資之豐當，逐次推進其基地，並進攻我海上交通綫，圖藉此以影響我海上運輸，我前綫將士爲應付此嚴重之戰向，刻正活用前於諸戰所獲得之戰略優勢，繼續奮國，且重創敵軍。尤以最近在所屬門，害爾貝特以及中國諸方面所獲之偉大光輝戰果，於戰史上實屬罕見，此在英。美人民，囚被其指導者所矇蔽，故無從知悉，而其間敵方人力損失之慘重，尤値吾人注意。</p>
<p>日正强力增產飛機</p>
<p>我皇軍將士能以一斃十，故英美軍之桃戰，無異飛蛾撲火，其前途自必充滿黑暗，而彼等之將來，惟獲最後之失敗。今我一億國民已呼應前綫將士之奮鬥，一致奮起，刻我國學生已行出征，徵兵年齡已行減低，此在交戰各國，均早已實施，惟在帝國目前始予實行，凡此均足證明帝國在動員上實較英美佔優勢，並顯示帝國擊減英美之决意。以戰力言，單就增强航空戰力而論，已克服各種內難，實施强力增產，其數字呈現飛躍上升，生產現狀，較之去年度已增加二倍以上，去歲十一月一日增設軍需省，並於木年一月十五日由陸，海兩軍當局接管一切有關生產飛機之事宜，至此軍需省將正式充分發揮其機能，同時增產飛機之機構亦熊趨强化，故預料今後飛機之生產，當可增加數倍，而共前途尤堪期待·政府鑒於作戰之要求，深感對於航空工樂有再加改進之必要，我鐵維工業，曾於極短之時日內突破世界水準，顯示其世界最高之按術與能率，故今日將我人卓越之資質，充分於用飛機工業上，則飛機之飛躍增產，更有厚望。政府决定根據此種確信，參照行政查察之成續，與國民諸君不斷研究，以應前綫之耍望，而增强飛機戰力。</p>
<p>英美圖速收拾事態</p>
<p>最近，敵方於南太平洋方面採取不顧重大犧牲，而一味前來挑戰之戰法，自其此種戰略觀，則知英·美尤以美國，口頭雖高呼長期作戰，其內心則對早日結束戰事，渴望頗殷，此固由於彼等作戰之不利，補給路綫過長所致，面使彼等之處境苦　，亦實爲其原因。蓋美國所恃之軍需生產，巳達頂點，且因資材及勞力之問題，使其不安情緒更日趨深刻，英國則因戰力涸竭，已形疲痺不堪。反觀帝國，因有充分之時間，故戰略據點更臻堅固。南方眾需資源，亦急速成爲戰力化，大東亞各民族之團結，更趨强化，是則帝國所處之優越地位，彼等以任何力量，亦難動搖其絲亳，此爲彼等所最恐懼者。英·美之指導者，旣擅起無名之師，票使國民入作戰苦惱之深淵，今則垂視國民苦惱與不滿之與日俱深，寫迫之餘，爲掩飾眞象，保持顏面計，乃不得不出以無視人道之暴舉，文彼等聯合國家間之利害關係，逈不一致，矛盾奇多，故彼等欲圖於其未陷於不可救之前，希從速收拾事態，此乃當然之事。</p>
<p>國內體制成決戰化</p>
<p>今日敵方正焦慮不已，此實爲吾人澈底擊滅敵人千載難逢之良機，帝國始終沉着應付戰局，利用此種良機，重創敵人，如過去波島洋面六次空戰及吉島洋面四次空戰，敵方損失綦直，此在物資豐富之美國，亦爲一致命之打擊，吾人實不　想像。况敵軍於極短之時日內，葬身魚腹數萬，其影響美國人如何深刻，不言可喻，敵方指導者力岡掩飾，此種事實，亦迫不得已也。而於其間，使皇軍邀擊敵軍，威力之强大及使其不失良機，準備發動未來攻勢者，厥爲後方一僮目民增强戰力，尤其是飛機戰力，同時，吾人於物貿·心理兩方面，更應準備實行長期戰，所謂長期戰者，內應整備强靱且耐久之體制，外則整備足可隨時隨地痛擊敵人之　極攻勢，總之，今後作戰之要諦，在利用敵方總反攻之良機，擊滅敵方之戰力，同時吏應强化我戰力（尤其飛機戰力），予物質·心理兩方面，鞏固長期戰之熊勢，更進而轉守爲攻，以使敵人屈服。政府爲期國內决戰施策之推進，已根據上述作戰要諦，特於去秋以來，採取各種措置，俾作國內體制成爲决戰化。</p>
<h3>日政府今後　施策重點　决傾舉全力以爭勝利</h3>
<p>茲就今後政府所致力之施策重點，報吿如次。今日能否從速以優秀之飛機，充分供給前綫，實可决定當前之戰　及此次之戰爭之勝敗者，故從速生　大量之飛機，實爲增强戰力之絕對要求，此固非易事，吾人爲獲得必勝，必須予以完成，如前所述，政府决與國民　君，以堅決之確信，期此任務必告完成，增強戰力，尤爲增强航空戰力，除增　鐵，輕金屬，煤及其他重要資源外，强化　施國民勤，勞運動及確保海陸運輸力，亦爲根本之要件。關於增產產要物資，政府爲適應作戰之要求，已在　期之增產計劃下，傾舉全力，使其實現，以期　無遺憾。又關於強化國民動勞運動，政府方面正就量之增加（即增加人）與　之向上（即提高生產效率）兩點，講求一切措置關於增加數量，已强化國民動員體制，增加國民之負擔，其影響國民生活之處，亦復不少，但政府爲適應今後之苛烈戰局，始出以此策，余確信國民諸君對於國家此種緊急之要求，亦必樂於接受。又關於質之　高，余認爲各方而尙有改善及提高之餘地，政府决努力加以指導，並願各方負責人加倍努力研究，以期其萬無遺憾。至海陸運輸力之確保及提高今日海上運輸所蒙受之損失，實難輕視，故此實應强化海空之護衛，極力減少船舶之損失，政府對於運輸船員裝卸物資之能率等問題，决講求緊急對策，排除萬難，促進船舶之建造，並强化陸運，以謀謀綜合確保並提高運輸力。</p>
<p>努力進行糧食增產</p>
<p>與上述露策並行者即確保食糧，政府從來對於食糧之增產，即於愼重之計劃下，努力進行，現日本之食糧，賴國民諸君之努力，使米毅麥等類均行大量產出，且更得滿洲國食糧之援助，故此後縱戰爭期限延至何時，决不能引起何種不安狀况，於日本農村傳統之醇風美俗下，不分老幼男女，相互扶持，突破幾多之困難，孜孜挺身於增產食糧，農村諸君之努力，洵堪銘感。蓋戰時下尤以戰爭長期化時，確保食糧爲如何重大問題，徵之戰史，至爲明顯，政府方面，亦爲期增產食糧及圓滑配給起見，此後將益加强化食糧自給，關於此點，極盼國民諸君予以更强之協力，又囚戰局之進展，而謀增加租稅及强化國民貯蓄，自毋庸言，政府願於國民諸君之協力下，期獲得萬全之成果，與以上諸施策並行。官吏服務之决戰化，實爲各般施策之根本前提，鑑於戰局之重大，我等官吏如何遂行職責，即可反映國民之士氣及左右國民之活動，對於戰爭遂仃影響至大，此際特公布戰時官吏服務法令，關於官吏處於戰時下之方送有所明示，此際我等官吏須深自反省，拳拳服膺，本勅令所示，期戰時下之服務，不致有絲毫之潛　，是所深望也。以上爲推行戰爭之要　及政府　內　策之要點。（以下轉入第二版）</p>

<h3>東條首相演詞</h3>
<p>上接第一版</p>
<p>日軍發揮報國精神</p>
<p>茲余願特別喚起注意者，即我等一億國民須有一貫之必勝信念，此即確信大東亞戰爭可獲得最後勝利，戰爭究爲意志與意志之戰爭，自不待言，世界列强舉其國力從事戰鬥己數年於茲，始終堅信最後勝利，繼續奮鬥者，始能獲得最後勝利，最後勝敗之决定，實極微妙，吾人須覺悟今後尙有幾多困難。同時於皇軍猛擊之下，敵方之苦惱當更趨入加重，如斯吾人可想像今後必經之過程，即敵我日趨疲倦，最後必勝信念，將悠動搖，苟有喪失鬥志者，即爲敗北，關於此戰，帝國具有冠絕世界之國體，可絕對不敗，而與帝國敵對之諸國家，洵堪憐憫。三千年來我皇室日臻繁榮，大和民族盡忠報國之精神，實非他國所能及，今爲自存自衛，始不得巳而倔起，帝國現正以大無畏精神，完遂大東亞戰爭，危險愈近，困難愈多，則我一億國民之精神愈形旺盛，皇軍勇士前於阿圖島及達拉瓦。瑪金兩島以寡敵衆，殲敵十數倍之敵軍後而王碎，此等勇士，實代表我一億國民對敵人　示大和民族之威力，吾人更不能忘記。於其他戰綫方面，尙有無數忠勇將士，亦曾建樹幷不劣於此等勇士之功勳，此偉大之精神，實即我一億國民之底力，吾人因有此世界唯一之精神力，必能獲得正義戰爭之最後勝利，敵人內心恐懼者，亦即此精神力，有此偉大精神，復實行前述之諸方策，故吾人前途惟最後勝利。</p>
<p>東亞團結愈趨堅固</p>
<p>反觀大東亞情勢，客歲十一月曾召開大東亞會議，該次會議之召開，實爲空前盛舉，東亞各國指導者會聚一堂，檢討入東亞之未來，謀作共同之决意，即大東亞各國共同宣言，决於共存共榮，獨立親和，闡揚文化，發展經濟，貢獻世界進展之五原則下，完遂大東亞戰爭，建設大東亞新秩序，俾確立世界和平。此大東亞共同宣霄，實即我華國大理想，與大東亞各民族之理想已趨一致之表現，並藉此對全世界闡明全東亞人共同之信念，今大東亞十　民衆，愈形緊密提携，正作最大努力，期擊滅東亞侵略者，貢獻世界和平，帝國對於大東亞諸民族之衷心協力，實不勝感激，藉此機會，余願與諸君共同對大東亞諸民族表示甚深之謝意，現日。滿一心一德之紐帶，已愈趨堅固，客歲中·日同盟條約及日·泰條約締結，緬甸國及菲律賓國相繼獨立，馬來·蘇門答臘·爪哇。婆羅洲及西里伯等地原　民之參政，亦着着實現，邇來原居民對帝國之協力，更形積極，敵方雖不擇手段，恣意恫嚇或施惡辣之謀略，然大東亞指導者，仍敢然興之對抗。</p>
<p>美方盲炸日必報復</p>
<p>最近美方盲炸大東亞各地都市之非軍事設施，慘殺無辜民衆，大東亞各國民衆，因此種非人道行爲而至喪失性命流離失所者，不知凡幾。余僅對此等東亞民衆，衷心表示同情，並對突破此種苦境之大東亞民衆表示敬意。敵人此等暴行，實爲人神所不許，不久帝國當對之給以報復，甚望英·美大衆銘記帝國此種斷乎之决意，今大東亞十億民族之團結，日益加强，解放大東亞，建設大東亞之偉業，亦積極展開，而英美猶引誘渝方，於開羅討論彼等最後之方途，實已暴露英·美與渝方精神連擊之破綻。中·日已恢復自主獨立，永久友好之正常關係，渝方因而喪失抗戰意義，故英。美不能不注視渝方治下民衆之新動向，除懷柔重慶之指導者外，則別無良策。開羅會談後，渝方民衆所得者，僅爲空言與無內容之援助，因此相接影響其本身者、亦僅爲戰爭苦惱之延長與增大，英美曩曾呼號反攻緬甸，今又豫語直接援助渝方，於雨季已過燥期亦已大半消逝，尚未作何等行勁，不久新雨季將至，其企圖終成泡影。</p>
<p>獨立空氣瀰漫全印</p>
<p>又英·美所抱之理想與人道如何空虛，徵諸英。美對其所支配各民族及黑人等等施策，問可明　，　排斥人種差別，共享萬邦共榮之榮者，乃我等亞舟民族多年之宿望，遙遠之理想，然英美常企圖使其他民族奴隸化，謀其本身之繁榮，於東亞彼等所企圖者，在使現在建設中之新大東亞再渝爲彼守榨取之天地·此即我等理想與敵英美不同者，亦爲我等大東亞十億民族决對不莫能容忍者，尤其印度大衆，依然於英美之暴力下呻吟，是爲余所最同情者，江特拉鮑斯氏，領導幾多印度志士，已爲印度獨立而倔起。帝國於大東亞會　中，特請江氏出席，並已闡明貯備於最近將安達曼羣島及尼科巴島，劃歸自由印度臨時政府直轄，俾以此為印度獨立之第一階梯，邇來爭取印度自由獨立之歷史偉業，即於江民指導下着推進，今印度四億民衆，於精神上已叛離英美，現正欲乘機呼應此正義之大運動。隨該運動之進展，印度民衆脫離英美極桔，倔起獨立之空氣，即將瀰漫全印，如斯印度高揚自由印度臨時政府大旗之日，不久當可來臨，帝國」再對世界闡明爲解放印度，决以實　與大東亞各國共同積極援助印度獨立運動。</p>
<p>對歐盟邦緊密提攜</p>
<p>再歡歐洲情勢，我盟邦德國，已於幾多苦難中，完成堅固之防衛陣，現在邁進於擊滅英美途上，吾人當可想樣德國所遭受之苦難，而德國現仍舉國一致，克復此種因難，昻揚戰意，始終確信最後勝利，今德軍飽經試鍊，刻正整備展開一大决戰之態勢，更將乘機以其獨特之陸上軍隊，痛擊英美敵軍，使蒙不能再起之打擊，故最近將來德軍之縱橫活躍，實堪期待。日·德兩國立足於建設世界新秩序之祟高理念上，始終相互信賴，於擊滅英美之戰鬥中，已形成一體不可分之關係，因此日·德之提携，尤以精神之提携，隨戰局之激烈化，愈形緊張。又墨索里尼統帥强力指導下之義大利，亦致力於加強軸心國至連擊，於茲謹對歐洲盟邦各國之奮鬥，表示滿腔敬意，同時期望更行緊密提携，東亞相呼應，擊滅英美，俾達成共同使命，以上披　政府對此重大時局之信念，甚望諸君充分了解政府直決意，相與誠心協力。同時關於此次政府提出之預算案及法案，亦切望於審議後予以協　。</p>
<p>英美野心昭然若揭</p>
<p>同時美國國民對美國為何在與美國安全毫無關係之東一亞僻地作戰，殊不理解，美國大總統多為之「新產業政策」，實於國內再難推進，爲另謀發展，乃煽動戰爭，使國民之關心轉向國外，並大事宣傳美國大陸將被外敵侵略，若無彼之如是挑撥，則此次戰爭當不致發生。按之實際，世界上無威脅美大陸之安全者，且美國國民足熊事受和平，而彼仍迫使美國挺而定險，甘願作不必要且高價之犧牲，彼又出以嚴如世界管理者東亞之支配者之行動，於挑撥歇戰之後，又擅自干涉東亞，對帝國加以經濟堅迫，進而並出以「經濟戰爭」之手段。故太平洋戰爭，於珍珠灣一役前，實已由美國發動，一視美國所發表之文書即可明瞭。美國係爲奪取殖民地而戰，總之，美國之戰爭亦即爲政略的戰爭，一觀美國欲於全世界鞏固代英國制霸世界之基礎一事，即可瞭然。英美不僅欲驅使參戰之國家，並玩弄種種策略與威壓，使中立國捲入戰爭，不顧戰禍之擴大，並恣意利用以謀自已之利益。如對士耳其等國之壓，迫已爲蹂躪國際道義之表現，故已引起世界人士之憤怒，然土耳其仍不變其熊度，同樣威脅之阿根廷亦出於堅毅之態度，粉碎彼等之騐謀。今英美於東亞之反攻雖已開始，然勝利並非僅以宣傳與欺瞞所能獲得者，東西軸心之堅陣亦仍未見微動。</p>
<p>日德保持緊密聯擊</p>
<p>又關於歐洲要塞，德軍已　理戰綫·期以磐石之堅陣與萬全之準備，邀擊敵軍，具有苦痛經騐之德國國民，正在希特勒元首統率卜，壓結一致付戰局，回爭取最後勝利之途邁進。現德軍將轉守爲攻，而德國國民亦於空襲之下，以不屈不撓之精神繼續奪鬥，此在敵方亦不得不加承認。帝國政府隨時與德國政府保持緊密之連繫，於軍事以及其他各種事項均作全面之協力。又新生義國在墨索里尼統帥指導下，復形驅起，成爲軸心之一環，於帝國與德國之共同戰綫，開拓義國光輝之將來，此頗堪期待。總之，歐洲軸心各國無不在努力完成此確固不動之共同戰爭，其爭取勝利之决心，未因敵方之宣傳而有些微之動搖。又太平洋方面敵方雖熾烈反攻，而我保衛東亞之堅陣毫未動搖，此實爲日軍於御稜威少下，勇敢奮鬥所賜，尤是爲我國國民感激者。</p>
<p>制勝之道厥在人和</p>
<p>英美所持者乃爲物質，於現代戰爭，物質之重要，實不能否定，然勝敗並非僅依物質即能决定，况敵人之物質上亦有幾多弱點，敵人不僅缺少人力，而地利亦爲吾等所據。再就國民戰意言，彼等實非吾等之歐，蓋吾人之必勝信念，不在於數，又不在於量，更不在於地利，實乃在於人和。當前我國民所處者，乃生死問題，回顧過去克服幾多困難之祖先偉業，則知奮鬥之精神，必能碴係我國之偉大將來，我國之前途必因一億國民之奮鬥，而充滿無限制光明，吾人賴天島陛下之御稜威及前綫將士之勇戰，後方國民之總動員，故最後勝利必屬吾人，已無庸疑，此次戰爭，對於日本係存亡之戰，對於東亞則爲興敗所繫之戰。德國在歐洲，伸展其大國勢力，日本則在東亞具備其大國實力，此均爲英美所企圖阻止者。英美在歐洲實抱「勢力均街政策」，在中國採用「門戶開放機會均等主義」，運用其殖民地政策之原因，亦在此也。彼等之根本政策，即使數個勢力相互衝突牽制，俾彼等乘間確立其自身對全世界之支配慾此即過去所謂「英國式之和平政策」及現在企圖中之「美國式和平政策」是也（未完）</p>
<h3>公司增資限制辦法　實部變通辦理　己呈奉政院指令照准</h3>
<p>南京二十一日中央社電實業部前爲保護公司基礎·穩定社會經濟，曾擬定公司增資登記限制暫行辦法，呈奉行政院會議通過，於上年十二月十六日公布施行。滬上實業界以及經濟學家，成認為此項辦法，實爲適當之措置，惟該部現據各地商民紛紛呈稱，在該辦法施行前，已經依法召集設東會，決議增資之公司，或已開始收集股款，甚至股款業將收齊，準備申請者頗多·其增資方式與前項暫行辦法之限制，自難盡期適合，倘均依法限制，其以前所辦之增資手續，盡歸無效，且已收股款，亦須退還，不特蒙受損失，期且　及官警，紛請俯體商艱，准予變通辦理等情。該部詳加審核，以該商等所陳，尚屬實情，經決定確在，該項限制暫行辦法施行前，已經辦理增資之公司，得由部酌予變通辦理。但於呈請核辦時。應提出足資證明之文件，如股東會決議錄公告等等，以昭信實。此項辦法，業由該部呈奉行政院，指令照准，經已諮令省市政府，暨所屬知照。</p>
<p>日機襲擊　印渝空輸路</p>
<p>仰光二十一日中央社電　緬甸方面日陸軍戰鬥機隊，十八日曾空襲印渝空輸路，擊落敵大型輸送機五架及直衝戰機二架</p>
<h3>日重光外相外交演說要旨復興東亞決促其實現</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電日重光外相今日在議會席上發表外交演說，其要旨如次：刻戰局愈益深刻，已爲衆所週知，英美自去以來，因不斷反攻，始能接觸東西軸心戰鬥綫之外廓，現彼等已感僅以自力再行進攻之困難，故不恤任何犧牲，藉他國之力繼續戰鬥。彼等曾在大東亞會議之前後，於莫斯科開羅及德　藺等地，先後舉行會談。彼等似已决定西對歐洲要塞。東對帝國。急速出以總反攻，此亦即爲彼等於今年之企圖。英美首腦部於去　十一月下旬曾邀渝方在開羅舉行會議，結果决定將澈底對帝國加以攻擊，使帝國無條件投降，且相約奪取帝國本土以外之領域，或作爲自已之領土，或將其分與渝方，以防止渝方之脫離反軸心陣容。彼等雖已驟明舉其全力實行對日總反攻，然迄今所獲得者，僅不過爲散在我前哨錢之數個島嶼，而其所付之代價，則有多數艦船及數十萬兵員葬於海底。</p>
<h3>加强信賞必罰制度　日本制定四項肅正官紀勒令</h3>
<p>日本政府鑒於振興官紀的重要性，而於去年十二月三十一日內閣會議上，曾正式決定下列四項勒令：　戰時管理服務令，　文官機戒戰時特例，　各　職員危　或遲官時之任用等特例，　警察及救火隊員懲戒戰時特例。正月四日，以官報號外公佈，即日實施。是日東條首相，啊特別在上午十時半首相官邸，招集在京，且如另項，發表訓詞，指示戰時官吏應有的態度。政府於去年九月所決定的國內態勢強化方策，其實行要目之一，即行政運營決戰化，主旨爲「求更進一步的官紀　正，而實行必要措置」，根據道一宗旨，方制定上述四項勒令，向樞密院請求審查，於去年十二月二十九日樞密院本會議，按政府原案批準。</p>
<p>中心爲戰時管理服務令</p>
<p>新勅令的主旨，是對於戰時官吏，重加申明信賞必罰的精神。所以新勅令的中心，就是在於可稱爲官吏「戰鬥訓誡」的「戰時官吏服務令」上。該令明確地指示出戰時官吏實踐躬行的具體事項，　執行責任　忘我工作　親自指揮　　遵命令　精誠親愛　保守德品　謹慎言行。</p>
<p>曾規定這七項義務，文官懲戒戰時特例，爲了嚴格執行服務令，這七項義務就是不可或缺的措置，然而懲戒方法方國，可以說又加上了新的禁閉處分。使必罰的規定嚴格化的另一面，即褒賞措置，加以擴充，在　各廳職員危　或退官時之任用等特例一上，對於官吏中勞苦功高者，以及因公務而病篤者，或退官退職者，開一榮昇的途徑。此外，至於警察及救火隊員懲戒戰時特例，是使文官懲戒戰爭時特例，於大東亞戰爭時期，應用委任官待遇的各廳警察及救火隊員者。四項勒令的全文如下：</p>
<p>戰時官吏服務令</p>
<p>凡官吏，必須貫撤國體本義，一心一德，忘我忠誠，而致匪躬之節，執行其本位職務。目前戰局愈演愈烈，而官吏的職責，亦因之愈益加重，嚴守官吏服務紀律外，特別努力實踐躬行左列各項，以期保證完遂戰爭。</p>
<p>一、官吏於戰時，特別注意實任之東大，竭盡不屈不撓之努力與精神，以貫徹其責任。</p>
<p>二、官吏於戰時，特別以誠懇的判斷，經常以大局爲前提，和衷共濟，全力供獻於完遂戰爭之大業。</p>
<p>三，官吏於戰時，特別對部下明示其應走的方向，而以身先統率。指導。</p>
<p>四、官吏於戰時，特別遵守上司的命令，勿失時機積極進行施策。</p>
<p>五，官吏於戰時，以特別入微之精神，體察民情。須精誠親愛任事。</p>
<p>六，官吏於戰時，特別重視廉潔風氣，以修身齊家，率先垂範，努力爲社會楷模之標的</p>
<p>七，官吏於戰時，特別謹愼其言行，同時對於保守機密，應切實注意。（附則）本令於公布之日起即實施之。</p>
<p>文官懲戒戰時特例</p>
<p>第一條　本令關於曾受大東亞戰爭中文官懲戒令，或使用明治四十年（一九〇七年）勒令第一百七十七號者，全使用之。</p>
<p>第二條　直屬長官，特別汪意綱紀之振肅，督責諸可，　慎從事，茍有遠反服務紀律，油漆違反戰時官吏服務令者，則按情狀之重輕置而採取嚴格之懲戒措置。</p>
<p>第三條　對於違背戰時官吏服務令及其他服務紀律，該當於文官懲戒令第二條者，可接第三條外之處分，罰以禁閉刑。得兼科以禁閉及滅俸之處分。</p>
<p>第四條　禁閉以六十日爲度，停止工作，幽居家內，實行禁閉。</p>
<p>直屬長官，司按情形，而對受禁閉處分者，取消家內禁閉，改爲反省修養，以命其從事適當工作。</p>
<p>直屬長官，萬不得己時，可使受禁閉處分者執行職務。</p>
<p>第五條　關於禁閉處分的手義，準用文官懲戒令中的減俸規定。</p>
<p>（附則）本令自公布之日起實施。（未完）（六魯譯自一月五日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>松島艦隊報道部長　談最近戰局日生產力蒸蒸日上</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日本駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐，昨（廿一）日午後於海軍武官府會見本市各報社記者時，就最近戰局發表談話如左：</p>
<p>最近太平洋戰局鬆弛，拉巴爾布爾根方面，亦呈停頓狀熊，唯於空戰正劇烈進行，敵方時以百架乃至數百架之機羣來襲，結果每爲我方空軍及猛烈砲火所擊退，敵方所蒙損失，可想而知。日本海軍防空武器之優良，設備之完善，使英美目前戰局，毫無寸進。敵方稱日本防空設備低劣之反宣傳，已不攻自破。</p>
<p>又據前綫情報所得敵空軍於出戰三次之後，即退至澳洲，當其初次出戰時，尙稱活躍，然連續出戰二次以上，即　志全失，敵方當局常使第一次作戰之軍士與第三次作戰之軍士，予以隔離，同時對退返澳洲之士兵，亦不准與其故鄕親友通信。</p>
<p>其次以日本生產狀况來講，敵美輒妄言日本生產力不强，並誇大其本國之生產力，一月十九日美國戰時生產局長却爾斯威爾遜，曾發表於一九四四年中需生產飛機十萬架，但結果美國各處所生產飛機發表數量，竟爲十二萬五千架，由此司見美政府對本國生產力無正確之估計。同時亦可發現美使用之勞働力（生產力）現巳達於最高限度，至於日本之生產力，現正蒸蒸日上，其發揮國內靑年之力量，僅爲最近數月之事而已一再如去年十一月間敵空軍侵襲高雄時，由於我方空軍之活躍，勇猛迎擊，敵基軍僅能於高雄市郊徘徊傷平民三人而已，所以今後日本對英美作戰前之處妄宣傳，僅一笑置之，我人唯觀空襲高雄後之情形，即一自瞭然。</p>
<p>昨日申報陳社長所發表之言論，本人亦已看過，其中最感可笑者，即重慶甘受英美驅壓，以西北資源供給英美，不惜以中國領土充作英美侵略根據地，不啻以空頭支票，徒然空喜，依此觀之，即可斷定重慶將來之命運如何，東洋民族最注重名節，重慶如此行爲，吾人爲之可慮。</p>

<p>昨日發報時間七點三十分再言戰時儲蓄</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>再言戰時儲蓄</h3>
<p>昨言戰時儲蓄，以「國民儲蓄運動」爲題，認爲領導國民儲蓄運動者必須苦心和努力研究各種新穎而有組織的對策，並須置重點於國民經濟泉源上的吸收，如是而後可以使人民「儘量節約，厲行貯蓄，積少成多，以充建設資金，擴大生產範圍，」有如周財政部長前日所發表的談話。</p>
<p>推行儲蓄决不單是幾個宣傳週的發動，和表面上的儲款中央儲備銀行，乃是有組織並且有裨實際的各種儲蓄對策，有如盟邦日本戰時國民儲蓄的進展，與其貯蓄機構的整備和擴充。日本對於國民儲蓄獎勵運動，是非常努力的；其各種儲蓄計劃與組織之足資我們借鏡者有如：　國民儲蓄組合的體制，包括市。鎭。村等地域組合的組織，　獎勵儲蓄方法的實施，例如各種辦理儲蓄機關之獲得課稅上的優待，　儲蓄證券之創設，使不便購入國債者能够協力儲蓄，故由政府自行發行司充長期儲蓄存款的證券，　拋棄各種金融總關以前非經營的原則，動員全國的普通銀行使其兼營儲蓄及信託業務，　儲蓄納稅制的實施，使租稅繳付和儲治發生密切的聯擊。在這樣努力推行與調整之下，日本的戰時國民儲畜，常呈飛躍增强的態勢，因此，大有補助於其龐大的戰費與生產擴充資金。這都是我國朝野上下所當刻意模仿的，才能使儲蓄運動發生充分的效用。</p>
<h3>大除夕收解商妥　各業安渡年關　拆息准開至明日爲止</h3>
<p>後日（二十四日）爲農曆大除夕，銀錢各業均己開始辦理總結束，市塲拆息准開至明（二十三日）爲止，各莊對於客戶存息結至前日爲止，際比總結賬期內，存款不計息，惟欠款則照算利息，均依照存息六元，欠息三十三元計算，關於大除夕收退票時間，業經銀聯會與錢庫商妥，是日决延長票據交換時間，退票以當日退齊爲原則，並聞　銀行業自二十五日起休假三天，至二十八日開市，　錢業自二十五日起休假四天，至二十九日上市，　各業市塲均定一月二十九日開紅盤交易，關於三十二年度各業營業，因物價之飛漲，頗多獲厚利，益以中央儲備銀行及銀聯會錢庫等竭力調劑，所以各行莊應付裕如，各業均安渡年關。</p>

<h3>師大學生的　勞動教育</h3>
<p>向來論勞動敎育都是紙上談兵，而學校跺稅中之所謂勞作者亦不外是兒戲·眞正的勞　敎育必須有眞正的勞動。</p>
<p>本年人冬以來，煤價大漲，現在是　一千斤的硬煤已經是九十元的價格了。漲價的原因，一部分是缺乏工人，和工人糧貧的昻貴。遠好最近有配給的辦法，只有持戶口單就可以到四郊煤棧去購買，每一千斤不過是四十餘元一。只是煤棧有限，而購者極多，一部分人還是買不到。</p>
<p>關於煤炭配給的問題，還有一樁有趣的設施，是和勞動敎育有關的。</p>
<p>軍管理門頭　煤礦公司最近與師範大學議定仿照日德寺國的戰時勞　敎育制度，由師範大學的學生在課餘時問來辦理煤炭配給運輸，以資圓滑供養燃料，並表現勞動精神，己經於本年元旦日起開始督運工作。據說目前師大學生勤勞服務，煤炭配給部已經將所需要的運煤排予車製好一部分，預備於本月十日起就有一部分煤炭是由師大學生來拉運的，而且定於本月九日上午九時在和平門外該部貯炭塲，舉行師大學生勤勞服務開始典禮，該部全體職員和師大校長秘書長，門頭溝煤礦公司管理人白島氏和各關係方面都要出席參加·這實在是一個有趣的組識，同時也是値得注意的。像這樣的辦法才算是眞正的勞動敎育。（一月十五日羅明寄）</p>

<h3>軍人班（二）</h3>
<p>在那年的暑假，菊池配屬將校組織了軍事參觀團，親自率領着有志者六十餘名，游歷九州和中國。眞人旣巳下了决心，所以也參加在內·隆夫同小森，是不待言的。</p>
<p>他們的一行，先從菊池少佐的故鄕，熊本留守師團，開始參觀。在炎天下軍隊的訓練，確是猛烈到極點。軍服的後背上，被汙浸着好像濕手巾似的。</p>
<p>他們到陸軍醫院去慰問滿洲事變的傷兵，戚慰問戰死者的遣族們，他們的行動，的確忙碌得很，並且有少佐的車中敎授。隨時指導參觀地方的豫備知識，和這有關聯的單人精神的常　。因爲列李駛行迅速的　動，也有在開始打旽兒的。那也不能盡說他們的不專心，因爲這個參觀團，幾乎沒有住過旅館，都是在車中過夜的。所以學生們很顯得疲勞，少佐的目的，就是使他們堅忍耐勞。</p>
<p>「要鍛煉自己，鍛煉。」雖然沒說出口來，但是從他的眼中也可以看得出的。</p>
<p>最後的參觀地，是江田島的海軍兵學校。早晨六時，到了　市，從川原石坐上輸船·被朝輝映讓着的大小軍艦，整齊地停泊着。　夫做夢中鶩醒過來，走到舷邊，眞人則從朋友們的背縫中，睜眼望着。</p>

<p>一會兒，少佐回到學生這裹：「諸君，眞是非常可惜，這學校從昨天起放暑假了。但請常値敎官領導我們參觀，大家規矩一點。」</p>
<p>學生們都垂頭喪氣。但聽說這學校的暑假祇有十天！也嚇了一跳。</p>
<p>門內出現了穿海軍少佐白制服的敎官，領導他們。雖說是在休假中，但淸凈的校中，松樹，杉樹，櫻樹，以及襯着組碧的海的背景，這不像一所學校，充滿着淸凈的　圍氣。</p>
<p>約經過了二小時，全部都走遍了。那麼廣大的校址與校舍。另外還有正在新造中的校舍。最後在養浩館學生酒店，打開飯盒用膳前，敎官講演了，題目是「關於帝國海軍官兵學校。」</p>

<h3>Wartime Official Discipline and Certain Reward and Punishment</h3>
<p>Japan decided in February to strengthen its national posture to meet the urgent needs of the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War. One of the most important practical steps is "Administrative Operation Decisive Battle." In order to further rectify official discipline, it took necessary measures. Therefore, the cabinet formally decided on four imperial ordinances in a meeting on December 21 last year and announced them on January 4 this year. It stipulated that they would be implemented immediately to strengthen the system of certain reward and punishment, strengthen the domestic decisive battle base, and complete the Greater East Asia War. These four imperial ordinances include: Wartime Civil Service Order, Special Wartime Exceptions for Civil Service Disciplinary Actions, Special Exceptions for Appointment of Various Officials in Times of Danger or Retirement, and Special Wartime Exceptions for Disciplinary Actions for Police and Rescue Team Members. (See page 2 of today's Japan newspaper) To sum up, the main purpose of these four imperial ordinances is to reiterate the spirit of certain reward and punishment for wartime officials. Therefore, the core can be said to be the Wartime Civil Service Order. These imperial ordinances clearly indicate the specific matters that wartime officials should diligently practice, and clearly stipulate the practical methods of punishing crimes and rewarding merits. Although they are all determined based on the current internal and external situation of the allied country Japan, they are not without reference and application significance for the government's public officials today.</p>
<p>Since the National Government returned to its capital, what the government has sought is nothing more than the restoration and security of public order in the peace zone, especially the political track. Since the war, our country's responsibility for completing the Greater East Asia War has become more arduous. Just as we have always tirelessly advocated, whether it is to demand the practical fulfillment of the obligation to participate in the war, or to demand the realization of a new unified situation, the only prerequisite is to demand that politics be on the right track, to demand that politics have a solution, which is to improve political efficiency. Because only when these requirements are realized politically, can we ensure public order and cooperate with the United States and Britain in the war, and economically increase production to ensure the livelihood of the people and assist the allied countries. However, the realization of these political requirements, or the complete establishment of the wartime political system and the thorough implementation of all wartime policy programs, in our China, "we are not worried about the lack of governance methods, but worried about the lack of governance personnel," so we should pay special attention to carefully selecting the virtuous and capable, rectifying official discipline, and strengthening the system of certain reward and punishment. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the content of the Japanese government's imperial ordinance on rectifying official discipline.</p>
<p>In the four Japanese imperial ordinances on rectifying official discipline this time, the seven admonitions for wartime officials that must be practiced wholeheartedly are clearly stipulated. What is particularly worthy of attention by government leaders and general public officials is the third item: In wartime, officials should especially show their subordinates the direction they should take and lead by example. The fifth item: In wartime, officials should observe public sentiment with special care and strive to be sincere, affectionate, and responsible. And the sixth item: In wartime, officials should pay special attention to integrity, cultivate themselves and manage their families, take the lead in setting an example, and strive to be a model for society. This fully demonstrates that wartime officials must especially understand the people's hardships, respect public opinion, and be especially honest; they must lead by example in everything, which are the prerequisites for the political improvement of the National Government that we have repeatedly suggested. In addition, how should particularly severe punishments be given to those who violate wartime official discipline, and how should special preferential rewards be given to those who faithfully abide by official discipline and thus suffer illness, ruin their families, or even sacrifice their lives? These are all urgent matters that need to be clearly stipulated in our country.</p>
<p>"If the name is not correct, then the words will not be smooth; if the words are not smooth, then things will not be done." We admire the new imperial ordinance of the Japanese government to strengthen the system of certain reward and punishment, and we sincerely expect the government authorities to further consider the actual situation in our country today, clearly stipulate the service rules for wartime officials and resolutely implement the system of certain reward and punishment, clarify right and wrong, respect public opinion, recruit true talents, and improve politics, and then be able to fulfill the mission of participating in the war and building the country.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Prime Minister Tojo's Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo delivered a policy speech at the reopening of the 84th session of the Parliament on the 21st. The original text is recorded as follows. At the opening ceremony of the previous parliament, I was honored to receive a special edict from His Majesty the Emperor, which I am deeply grateful and afraid of. I sincerely wish to serve with you under the holy decree, and to complete the heavy responsibilities under the decisive battle with all our strength, and to quickly achieve the purpose of the war, so as to reassure the Emperor. Looking back on the two years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the officers and soldiers of the Imperial Army, under the majesty of the Emperor, have fought bravely and continuously. Here, I would like to express my gratitude to the officers and soldiers fighting on the front line, express my condolences to the fallen warriors, express my sincere sympathy to their bereaved families, and wish the wounded soldiers and soldiers a speedy recovery. Finally, I would like to express my deep respect to the people who continue to work hard in the rear to win the victory. Looking at the overall situation of the Greater East Asia War, the enemy's counterattack has recently become more intense. Although they have been repeatedly hit hard, they rely on their abundant resources and gradually advance their bases, and attack our maritime transportation lines, trying to affect our maritime transportation. Our front-line officers and soldiers are making use of the strategic advantages gained in previous battles to continue to fight and inflict heavy damage on the enemy. Especially the great and glorious results recently obtained in the Solomon Islands, Gilbert Islands, and various aspects of China are rare in the history of war. This is not known to the British and American people, who are blinded by their leaders. It is worth noting that the enemy's heavy losses in manpower.</p>
<p>Japan is Vigorously Increasing Aircraft Production</p>
<p>Our Imperial Army officers and soldiers can kill ten enemies with one, so the challenge of the British and American armies is no different from moths flying into the fire. Their future will inevitably be full of darkness, and their future will only be the final failure. Now our 100 million people have responded to the struggle of the front-line officers and soldiers and have risen up together. Our students have gone to war, and the conscription age has been lowered. This has been implemented in various warring countries for a long time, but it is only being implemented in the Empire at present. All of this proves that the Empire is superior to Britain and the United States in mobilization, and shows the Empire's determination to defeat Britain and the United States. In terms of combat power, just to enhance air combat power, we have overcome various internal difficulties and implemented vigorous production increase. The numbers show a leaping increase. The current production status has increased more than twice compared to last year. On November 1 last year, the Ministry of Munitions was established, and on January 15 of this year, the army and navy authorities took over all matters related to aircraft production. At this point, the Ministry of Munitions will officially and fully exert its functions, and the aircraft production mechanism will tend to be strengthened. Therefore, it is expected that aircraft production can be increased several times in the future, and its future is especially promising. The government, in view of the requirements of the war, deeply feels the need to further improve the aviation industry. Our iron and steel industry has broken through the world standard in a very short period of time, showing its world's highest technology and efficiency. Therefore, today, if we fully apply our outstanding qualities to the aircraft industry, there is greater hope for a leaping increase in aircraft production. The government has decided to enhance aircraft combat power based on this conviction, referring to the results of administrative inspections, and constantly studying with the people to meet the needs of the front line.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States are Trying to Settle the Situation Quickly</p>
<p>Recently, the enemy has adopted a war strategy in the South Pacific that disregards major sacrifices and insists on challenging. From this strategic point of view, we know that Britain and the United States, especially the United States, although loudly proclaiming a long-term war, are eager to end the war as soon as possible. This is due to their unfavorable war and the excessive length of the supply line, which makes their situation difficult. The reason is that the military production that the United States relies on has reached its peak, and the problems of materials and labor have made their anxiety increasingly deep. Britain, on the other hand, has been exhausted due to the depletion of its combat power. On the other hand, the Empire has sufficient time, so the strategic strongholds are more solid. The resources in the south are also rapidly becoming combat power, and the unity of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia is becoming stronger. The superior position of the Empire is difficult for them to shake in any way, which is what they fear most. The leaders of Britain and the United States have started an unjust war, forcing the people into the abyss of war suffering. Now, they are forced to cover up the truth and maintain face in the face of the increasing suffering and dissatisfaction of the people, so they have to resort to inhumane atrocities. The interests of their allied countries are not consistent, and there are many contradictions. Therefore, they want to settle the situation as soon as possible before they fall into an irredeemable situation, which is a natural thing.</p>
<p>The Domestic System is Becoming Decisive Battle</p>
<p>Today, the enemy is anxious, which is a rare opportunity for us to thoroughly defeat the enemy. The Empire has always calmly dealt with the war situation and used this opportunity to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. For example, in the six naval battles off the coast of Bougainville Island and the four naval battles off the coast of Kiska Island, the enemy suffered heavy losses. This is a fatal blow to the United States, which is rich in resources. It is unimaginable. Moreover, tens of thousands of enemy troops were buried in the belly of fish in a very short period of time. It is self-evident how deeply this affected the American people. The enemy's leaders were forced to cover up this fact. In the meantime, the Imperial Army intercepted the enemy and showed its great power, and did not miss the opportunity to prepare for future offensives. The rear area enhanced combat power, especially aircraft combat power. At the same time, we should prepare to implement a long-term war in both material and psychological aspects. The so-called long-term war should be equipped with a strong and durable system internally, and externally equipped with a powerful offensive that can strike the enemy anytime and anywhere. In short, the key to future operations is to use the opportunity of the enemy's general counterattack to destroy the enemy's combat power, while strengthening our combat power (especially aircraft combat power), consolidating the momentum of the long-term war in both material and psychological aspects, and further turning defense into offense to make the enemy surrender. In order to promote domestic decisive battle measures, the government has taken various measures since last autumn based on the above-mentioned operational essentials to make the domestic system become decisive battle.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government's Key Policy Focus in the Future is to Devote All Efforts to Win the Victory</h3>
<p>Now I will report on the key policy focus that the government will focus on in the future. Today, whether we can quickly supply the front line with excellent aircraft is the key to determining the current war situation and the victory or defeat of this war. Therefore, rapidly producing a large number of aircraft is an absolute requirement to enhance combat power. This is not easy, but we must complete it to win. As mentioned earlier, the government will work with the people to complete this task with firm conviction. To enhance combat power, especially to enhance air combat power, in addition to increasing iron, light metals, coal, and other important resources, strengthening the National Labor Movement and ensuring sea and land transportation capacity are also fundamental requirements. Regarding the increased production of essential materials, the government has devoted all its efforts to achieve it under the increasing production plan in order to meet the requirements of the war, so as to avoid any regrets. Regarding the strengthening of the National Labor Movement, the government is taking all measures in terms of increasing the quantity (that is, increasing the number of people) and improving the quality (that is, improving production efficiency). Regarding increasing the quantity, the National Mobilization System has been strengthened, and the burden on the people has been increased. This has also had a significant impact on the people's lives, but the government has taken this measure to meet the harsh war situation in the future. I am sure that the people will be happy to accept the country's urgent demands. Regarding improving the quality, I believe that there is still room for improvement and improvement in all aspects. The government is determined to guide it, and I hope that the responsible persons in all aspects will redouble their efforts to study so as to avoid any regrets. As for ensuring and improving sea and land transportation capacity, the losses suffered by sea transportation today are difficult to ignore. Therefore, we should strengthen the protection of the sea and air and strive to reduce the loss of ships. The government will take urgent measures to solve the problems of the efficiency of transport ship crews loading and unloading materials, overcome all difficulties, promote the construction of ships, and strengthen land transportation in order to comprehensively ensure and improve transportation capacity.</p>
<p>Strive to Increase Food Production</p>
<p>Parallel to the above-mentioned measures is to ensure food supply. The government has always strived to increase food production under careful planning. Thanks to the efforts of the people, Japan's food, such as rice and wheat, has been produced in large quantities, and it has also received food assistance from Manchuria. Therefore, no matter how long the war lasts in the future, it will not cause any anxiety. Under the traditional pure customs and beautiful customs of Japanese rural areas, regardless of old or young, men or women, they support each other, overcome many difficulties, and diligently devote themselves to increasing food production. The efforts of rural people are truly commendable. It is clear from the history of the war that ensuring food supply is a very important issue, especially in the event of a prolonged war. In order to increase food production and smooth distribution, the government will further strengthen food self-sufficiency. In this regard, I hope that the people will provide stronger cooperation. It goes without saying that we will increase taxes and strengthen national savings in view of the progress of the war. The government hopes to achieve perfect results with the cooperation of the people. Parallel to the above measures, the decisive battle of civil service is the fundamental premise of all measures. In view of the importance of the war situation, how our officials perform their duties can reflect the morale of the people and affect the activities of the people, which has a great impact on the war. At this time, the Wartime Civil Service Order was specially promulgated, which clearly stated the way officials should be during the war. At this time, our officials must deeply reflect on themselves, sincerely obey, and hope that the service under the war will not have the slightest slack. The above are the essentials of promoting the war and the main points of the government's internal policies. (The following turns to page 2)</p>

<h3>Prime Minister Tojo's Speech</h3>
<p>Continued from the first page</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Display Patriotic Spirit</p>
<p>What I wish to particularly draw attention to is that our one hundred million people must have a consistent belief in certain victory, that is, to be convinced that the Greater East Asia War can achieve final victory. Needless to say, war is a battle of wills, and those great powers of the world who have devoted their national strength to fighting for years, and who have consistently believed in final victory and continued to struggle, will be able to achieve final victory. The decision of final victory or defeat is extremely subtle, and we must realize that there are still many difficulties ahead. At the same time, under the fierce attacks of the Imperial Army, the enemy's suffering will become more and more serious. In this way, we can imagine the process that must be experienced in the future, that is, the enemy and ourselves will become increasingly tired, and the belief in final victory will gradually waver. Whoever loses the will to fight will be defeated. Regarding this war, the Empire has a national polity that surpasses the world and can never be defeated, while the countries that are hostile to the Empire are truly pitiable. For three thousand years, our Imperial Family has become increasingly prosperous, and the spirit of the Yamato people to be loyal to the country is beyond the reach of other countries. Today, for self-preservation and self-defense, we have no choice but to rise up. The Empire is now completing the Greater East Asia War with a spirit of great courage. The closer the danger, the more the difficulties, the more vigorous the spirit of our one hundred million people will be. The brave soldiers of the Imperial Army fought against a multitude of enemies on Attu Island and Tarawa and Makin Islands, annihilating ten times the number of enemy troops before sacrificing themselves. These brave soldiers represent the power of the Yamato nation to our one hundred million people. We must not forget this. On other battle lines, there are countless loyal and brave soldiers who have also made achievements no less than those of these brave soldiers. This great spirit is the underlying strength of our one hundred million people. Because we have this unique spiritual power in the world, we will be able to achieve the final victory in the righteous war. What the enemy fears in their hearts is this spiritual power. With this great spirit, and by implementing the aforementioned strategies, we have only final victory ahead of us.</p>
<p>East Asian Solidarity Becomes More Solid</p>
<p>Looking back at the situation in Greater East Asia, the Greater East Asia Conference was held last November. The convening of this conference was an unprecedented event. The leaders of the East Asian countries gathered together to review the future of East Asia and to make a joint decision, that is, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, resolving to complete the Greater East Asia War under the five principles of co-existence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, promoting culture, developing the economy, and contributing to the progress of the world, and to build a new order in Greater East Asia, so as to establish world peace. This Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is a manifestation of the fact that the great ideals of our China and the ideals of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia have become unified, and through this, it clarifies to the whole world the common beliefs of all East Asians. Today, the ten million people of Greater East Asia are working more closely together, making their greatest efforts to destroy the aggressors of East Asia and contribute to world peace. The Empire is deeply grateful for the heartfelt cooperation of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. Now, the bond between Japan and Manchuria is becoming stronger and stronger. Last year, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Japan-Thailand Treaty were concluded, and Burma and the Philippines became independent one after another. The participation in politics of the original inhabitants of Malaya, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Celebes is also being realized step by step. Recently, the cooperation of the original inhabitants with the Empire has become more active. Although the enemy is using all means to arbitrarily intimidate or carry out evil schemes, the leaders of Greater East Asia still dare to confront them.</p>
<p>The U.S.'s Indiscriminate Bombing Will Be Avenged</p>
<p>Recently, the United States has indiscriminately bombed non-military facilities in cities throughout Greater East Asia, massacring innocent civilians. Countless people in Greater East Asia have lost their lives and been displaced as a result of such inhumane acts. I would like to express my heartfelt sympathy to these East Asians and my respect to the people of Greater East Asia for overcoming these difficulties. Such atrocities by the enemy are not allowed by humans or gods, and the Empire will soon retaliate against them. I hope that the British and American public will remember the Empire's resolute determination. Today, the unity of the one billion people of Greater East Asia is increasing day by day, and the great cause of liberating Greater East Asia and building Greater East Asia is also being actively carried out. However, the United Kingdom and the United States are still luring Chongqing to discuss their final path in Cairo, which has exposed the flaws in the spiritual connection between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Chongqing. China and Japan have restored their autonomous and independent, permanently friendly and normal relations, and Chongqing has therefore lost the significance of resisting Japan. Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States cannot but pay attention to the new trends of the people under the rule of Chongqing, and there is no better policy than to appease the leaders of Chongqing. After the Cairo talks, the people of Chongqing only received empty words and unsubstantial assistance, and as a result, the only thing that affected them was the extension and increase of the suffering of the war. The United Kingdom and the United States once called for a counter-offensive against Burma, and now they are predicting direct assistance to Chongqing. The rainy season has passed and most of the dry season has passed, but they have not taken any action. Soon the new rainy season will arrive, and their attempt will eventually become a bubble.</p>
<p>The Air of Independence Pervades All of India</p>
<p>Furthermore, how empty are the ideals and humanity held by the United Kingdom and the United States can be clearly seen by examining the policies implemented by the United Kingdom and the United States towards the various ethnic groups and black people under their control. To eliminate racial discrimination and share the glory of universal prosperity is the long-cherished hope and distant ideal of our Asian people for many years. However, the United Kingdom and the United States often attempt to enslave other ethnic groups and seek their own prosperity. What they are attempting in East Asia is to transform the new Greater East Asia that is now being built into a world for them to exploit again. This is the difference between our ideals and those of the British and Americans, and it is also something that our one billion people of Greater East Asia will absolutely not tolerate. In particular, the masses of India are still groaning under the violence of the British and Americans, which is what I sympathize with the most. Mr. Chandra Bose, leading many Indian patriots, has risen up for the independence of India. The Empire specially invited Mr. Jiang to attend the Greater East Asia Conference, and has clarified that it will reserve the Andaman Islands and the Nicobar Islands to be directly under the jurisdiction of the Provisional Government of Free India in the near future, so as to take this as the first step towards the independence of India. Recently, the great historical cause of striving for the freedom and independence of India is being promoted under the guidance of the Jiang people. Today, the four hundred million people of India have spiritually rebelled against the British and Americans, and are now seeking an opportunity to respond to this great movement of justice. With the progress of this movement, the Indian people will break away from the British and Americans and the air of rising up for independence will pervade all of India. In this way, the day when India raises the flag of the Provisional Government of Free India will soon come. The Empire reiterates to the world that in order to liberate India, it will definitely provide concrete assistance to the Indian independence movement together with the countries of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Close Cooperation with European Allies</p>
<p>Looking again at the situation in Europe, our ally Germany has completed a solid defense line amidst many hardships, and is now advancing on the path of destroying the United Kingdom and the United States. We can imagine the suffering that Germany has suffered, but Germany is still united as a country, overcoming these difficulties, raising its fighting spirit, and consistently believing in final victory. Today, the German army has been tested and is now preparing to launch a major decisive battle, and will take the opportunity to use its unique land forces to inflict a painful blow on the British and American enemy forces, preventing them from rising again. Therefore, the future activity of the German army is worthy of expectation. Japan and Germany, based on the lofty concept of building a new world order, have always trusted each other, and have formed an indivisible relationship in the battle to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the cooperation between Japan and Germany, especially the spiritual cooperation, is becoming more tense as the war situation intensifies. In addition, Italy, under the strong leadership of Mussolini, is also committed to strengthening the Axis powers. Here, I would like to express my full respect to the struggle of the various European allied countries, and at the same time, I hope that we will cooperate more closely with each other, respond to East Asia, destroy the United Kingdom and the United States, so as to achieve our common mission. The above is a summary of the government's beliefs on this major situation. I hope that you will fully understand the government's resolute determination and cooperate sincerely with each other. At the same time, I also hope that after deliberation, you will approve the budget bill and the bills submitted by the government this time.</p>
<p>The Ambitions of the United Kingdom and the United States are Obvious</p>
<p>At the same time, the American people do not understand why the United States is fighting in the remote area of East Asia, which has nothing to do with the security of the United States. The "New Deal" of the President of the United States is difficult to promote in the country, so he incites war in order to seek further development, so that the people's concern turns to foreign countries, and vigorously publicizes that the American continent will be invaded by foreign enemies. If there were no such provocations, this war would not have occurred. In fact, there is no one in the world who threatens the security of the American continent, and the American people are content to enjoy peace, but he still forces the United States to take risks, willing to make unnecessary and high-priced sacrifices, and he also acts as the administrator of the world and the ruler of East Asia, arbitrarily interfering in East Asia after provoking the war, imposing economic pressure on the Empire, and even resorting to the means of "economic warfare." Therefore, the Pacific War was actually launched by the United States before the Pearl Harbor incident, as can be seen from the documents published by the United States. The United States is fighting to seize colonies. In short, the war of the United States is also a war of political strategy. One can see that the United States wants to consolidate the foundation for Britain's dominance of the world throughout the world. The United Kingdom and the United States not only want to drive the countries participating in the war, but also play various strategies and threats to involve neutral countries in the war, regardless of the expansion of the war, and arbitrarily use it to seek their own interests. For example, the pressure and persecution of countries such as Turkey has been a manifestation of trampling on international morality, so it has aroused the anger of people all over the world, but Turkey has not changed its attitude, and Argentina, which is similarly threatened, has also taken a firm attitude, shattering their scheme. Although the counter-offensive of the United Kingdom and the United States in East Asia has already begun, victory cannot be obtained by propaganda and deception alone, and the firm array of the East-West Axis has not moved slightly.</p>
<p>Japan and Germany Maintain Close Ties</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the European fortresses, the German army has managed the battle line and is preparing to repel the enemy forces with a solid array and complete preparations. The German people, who have experienced pain, are uniting under the leadership of Führer Hitler, and are marching on the road to recovering the war and striving for final victory. Now, the German army will turn from defense to offense, and the German people, under the air raids, continue to fight with an indomitable spirit, which even the enemy has to admit. The Imperial Government maintains close ties with the German government at all times, and provides comprehensive assistance in military and other matters. In addition, the new Italy, under the leadership of Mussolini, has been revived and has become a part of the Axis powers, opening up a bright future for Italy on the common front of the Empire and Germany, which is quite worthy of expectation. In short, all the Axis countries in Europe are making efforts to complete this firm and immovable common war, and their determination to strive for victory has not been shaken in the slightest by the enemy's propaganda. In addition, although the enemy's counter-offensive in the Pacific is fierce, our firm array to protect East Asia has not been shaken in the slightest, which is due to the brave struggle of the Japanese army under the command of His Majesty the Emperor, and is especially what our people are grateful for.</p>
<p>The Way to Victory Lies in Harmony</p>
<p>What the United Kingdom and the United States hold is material things. In modern warfare, the importance of material things cannot be denied, but victory or defeat cannot be determined by material things alone. Moreover, the enemy also has many weaknesses in material things. The enemy not only lacks manpower, but also the geographical advantage is occupied by us. Furthermore, in terms of the national will to fight, they are not our opponents, because our belief in certain victory does not lie in number, nor in quantity, nor in geographical advantage, but in harmony. At present, what our people are facing is the question of life and death. Looking back at the great achievements of our ancestors who overcame many difficulties in the past, we know that the spirit of struggle will definitely guarantee the great future of our country. The future of our country will be full of unlimited light because of the struggle of our one hundred million people. We rely on the authority of His Majesty the Emperor and the brave fighting of the soldiers on the front line, and the total mobilization of the people in the rear, so there is no doubt that the final victory will belong to us. This war is a war of survival for Japan, and a war of rise and fall for East Asia. Germany is expanding its great power in Europe, and Japan has its great power in East Asia, which are both what the United Kingdom and the United States are trying to prevent. The United Kingdom and the United States actually embrace the "balance of power policy" in Europe, and adopt the "open door and equal opportunity doctrine" in China. The reason for using their colonial policy also lies in this. Their fundamental policy is to make several forces conflict and contain each other, so that they can take the opportunity to establish their own control over the world. This is the so-called "British peace policy" in the past and the "American peace policy" that is now being attempted. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Measures to Restrict Capital Increase of Companies Implemented Flexibly by the Ministry of Industry Have Been Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) The Ministry of Industry, in order to protect the foundation of companies and stabilize the social economy, had previously drafted interim measures to restrict the registration of capital increase of companies, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. They were promulgated and implemented on December 16 of last year. The industrial circles in Shanghai and economists all believe that these measures are appropriate. However, the Ministry is now said to have received reports from merchants and people in various places that before the implementation of these measures, companies that had already convened shareholder meetings in accordance with the law to resolve to increase capital, or had already begun collecting funds, or even had almost collected all the funds and were preparing to apply, were quite numerous. The methods of increasing capital were difficult to fully comply with the restrictions of the aforementioned interim measures. If they were all restricted in accordance with the law, the capital increase procedures previously handled would be invalid, and the funds already collected would have to be returned, which would not only cause losses, but also involve officials and police. They have asked to consider the difficulties of merchants and allow for flexible handling. The Ministry has reviewed the matter in detail, believing that what the merchants have stated is true. It has been decided that companies that had already handled capital increase before the implementation of the aforementioned interim measures may be handled flexibly by the Ministry at its discretion. However, when submitting the application for approval, they should submit sufficient documentary evidence, such as the minutes of the shareholders' meeting, announcements, etc., to show credibility. These measures have been submitted by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan, which has instructed approval, and has consulted the provincial and municipal governments and its affiliated organizations to inform them.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Attack the India-Chongqing Air Transport Route</p>
<p>Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency) On the 18th, a Japanese army fighter squadron in Burma attacked the India-Chongqing air transport route, shooting down five enemy large transport planes and two dive bombers.</p>
<h3>Main Points of Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's Diplomatic Speech: Determined to Realize the Revival of East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu delivered a diplomatic speech in the Diet today, the main points of which are as follows: The current war situation is becoming more and more profound, which is already well known. Since last year, the United Kingdom and the United States have been able to contact the outer edges of the East-West Axis battle line due to continuous counter-offensives. Now they feel that it is difficult to continue the offensive by their own strength alone, so they continue to fight with the strength of other countries, regardless of any sacrifices. Before and after the Greater East Asia Conference, they held talks in Moscow, Cairo, and Tehran. They seem to have decided to launch a general counter-offensive rapidly in the west against the European fortresses and in the east against the Empire. This is also their plan for this year. The leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States invited Chongqing to hold a meeting in Cairo in late November last year, and as a result, they decided to thoroughly attack the Empire, forcing the Empire to surrender unconditionally, and agreed to seize the territories outside the Empire's mainland, either as their own territory or to divide it with Chongqing, in order to prevent Chongqing from breaking away from the anti-Axis camp. Although they have suddenly made it clear that they will implement a general counter-offensive against Japan with all their strength, what they have gained so far is only a few islands scattered in our forward positions, and the price they have paid is that a large number of ships and hundreds of thousands of soldiers have been buried at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<h3>Strengthening the System of Clear Rewards and Punishments: Japan Formulates Four Orders to Rectify Official Discipline</h3>
<p>The Japanese government, recognizing the importance of revitalizing official discipline, formally decided on the following four orders at a Cabinet meeting on December 31 of last year: Ordinance on Wartime Management and Service, Special Exceptions to the Civil Service Code in Wartime, Special Exceptions to the Appointment of Employees of Various Ministries in Times of Danger or Resignation, Special Exceptions to the Discipline of Police and Firefighters in Wartime. On January 4, they were promulgated in the official gazette as an extra edition and implemented on the same day. On the same day, Prime Minister Tojo, in addition to the above, specially convened a meeting of officials in Tokyo at 10:30 a.m. at the Prime Minister's official residence and delivered an address instructing them on the attitude that officials should have in wartime. One of the key goals of the domestic situation strengthening measures decided by the government in September of last year is to make administrative operations decisive, with the aim of "seeking further rectification of official discipline and implementing necessary measures." Based on this goal, the above four orders were formulated and submitted to the Privy Council for review. At the Privy Council's plenary meeting on December 29 of last year, they were approved according to the government's original plan.</p>
<p>The Core is the Ordinance on Wartime Management and Service</p>
<p>The main aim of the new imperial ordinance is to reiterate the spirit of clear rewards and punishments for officials in wartime. Therefore, the core of the new imperial ordinance is the "Ordinance on Wartime Official Service," which can be called the "combat instruction" for officials. The ordinance clearly indicates the concrete matters that officials should practice, perform their responsibilities, work selflessly, personally command, obey orders, be sincere and loving, maintain morality, and be careful in words and deeds.</p>
<p>Seven obligations have been stipulated, and special exceptions to the Civil Service Discipline in Wartime are indispensable measures for strictly enforcing these seven obligations. However, it can be said that a new detention punishment has been added to the methods of discipline. On the other hand, the reward measures have been expanded to make the provisions for punishment stricter. The Special Exceptions to the Appointment of Employees of Various Ministries in Times of Danger or Resignation open a path to promotion for officials who have worked hard and achieved great merit, as well as those who are seriously ill due to official duties, or who are retiring or resigning. In addition, the Special Exceptions to the Discipline of Police and Firefighters in Wartime make the special exceptions to the Civil Service Discipline in Wartime applicable to police and firefighters in various ministries who are treated as commissioned officers during the Greater East Asia War. The full text of the four orders is as follows:</p>
<p>Ordinance on Wartime Official Service</p>
<p>All officials must carry out the essence of the national polity, be of one heart and one mind, be selfless and loyal, devote themselves to their duties, and fulfill their responsibilities. At present, the war situation is becoming more and more intense, and the responsibilities of officials are also becoming heavier. In addition to strictly observing the official service discipline, they must make special efforts to practice the following items in order to ensure the completion of the war.</p>
<p>1. Officials must pay special attention to the magnitude of their responsibilities during wartime and exert tireless effort and spirit to fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
<p>2. Officials must make decisions with special sincerity during wartime, always putting the overall situation first, working together harmoniously, and dedicating themselves fully to the great cause of completing the war.</p>
<p>3. Officials must especially clearly indicate to their subordinates the direction they should take during wartime and take the lead in leading and guiding them.</p>
<p>4. Officials must especially obey the orders of their superiors during wartime and actively implement policies without losing the opportunity.</p>
<p>5. Officials must be especially sensitive to public opinion during wartime and serve with sincerity and love.</p>
<p>6. Officials must especially value integrity during wartime, cultivate themselves and manage their families, take the lead in setting an example, and strive to be a model for society.</p>
<p>7. Officials must be especially careful in their words and deeds during wartime and pay close attention to maintaining confidentiality. (Supplementary Provisions) This ordinance shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>Special Exceptions to the Civil Service Discipline in Wartime</p>
<p>Article 1 This ordinance shall apply to those who have been subjected to the Civil Service Discipline Ordinance during the Greater East Asia War or who have used Imperial Ordinance No. 177 of the 40th year of Meiji (1907).</p>
<p>Article 2 Direct superiors must pay special attention to revitalizing discipline, supervise all matters diligently, and act prudently. If there is any violation of the service discipline or violation of the Wartime Official Service Ordinance, they shall take strict disciplinary measures according to the severity of the situation.</p>
<p>Article 3 For those who violate the Wartime Official Service Ordinance and other service disciplines and are subject to Article 2 of the Civil Service Discipline Ordinance, in addition to the punishment under Article 3, they may be punished with imprisonment. They may also be punished with both imprisonment and salary reduction.</p>
<p>Article 4 Imprisonment shall be limited to 60 days, during which work shall be suspended and confinement shall be carried out in the home.</p>
<p>The direct superior shall, according to the circumstances, cancel the confinement at home and change it to reflection and self-cultivation, ordering them to engage in appropriate work.</p>
<p>In cases of absolute necessity, the direct superior may order the person subjected to imprisonment to perform their duties.</p>
<p>Article 5 The regulations on salary reduction in the Civil Service Discipline Ordinance shall apply mutatis mutandis to the procedures for imprisonment.</p>
<p>(Supplementary Provisions) This ordinance shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. (To be continued) (Translated by Liu Lu from the Asahi Shimbun, January 5)</p>

<h3>Second Phase of Coal Briquettes for Household Registration to Go on Sale at the End of the Month Allotment Amount Increased Compared to the First Phase</h3>
<p>According to sources close to the coal industry yesterday, the second phase of coal briquettes for household registration in Districts 1 and 8 is expected to start selling around the 28th of this month. At that time, the allotment amount for each coal briquette purchase certificate will be increased compared to the first phase. However, the exact sales date and allotment amount may be officially announced by the authorities in the near future. As for the first phase of sales, it is scheduled to end in the middle of the day on the 24th of this month. Those who have not yet purchased coal briquettes for this phase should try to purchase them within these three days. According to another source, the authorities plan to postpone the allocation of lump coal needed by various industries and factories to the beginning of next month, because various procedures have not been fully completed. It is said that in the future, the allocation of lump coal will be limited to legitimate users, and those that are not necessary will be suspended.</p>
<h3>News from the Matsushima Fleet: Naval Press Officer Discusses Recent Battles, Japan's Booming Productivity</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Naval Press Officer Matsushima, a colonel in the Japanese fleet stationed in China, met with reporters from various city newspapers at the naval attaché’s office yesterday afternoon (the 21st). He made the following remarks regarding recent battles:</p>
<p>The recent Pacific battle situation has eased, and the situation around Rabaul and Bougainville has also stagnated. However, air battles are still intense. The enemy attacks with groups of hundreds or even several hundred aircraft, but each time they are repelled by our air force and intense artillery fire. The losses suffered by the enemy can be imagined. The superiority of Japanese naval air defense weapons and the completeness of our equipment mean that the British and Americans are making no progress in the current battle. Enemy propaganda claiming that Japanese air defense equipment is inferior has already been refuted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to frontline intelligence, enemy air forces retreat to Australia after three sorties. They are active during their first sortie, but after two or more consecutive sorties, they completely lose their will. Enemy authorities often separate soldiers who have fought for the first time from those who have fought for the third time. At the same time, soldiers returning to Australia are not allowed to communicate with their relatives and friends back home.</p>
<p>Next, regarding Japan's production situation, the enemy Americans often falsely claim that Japan's productivity is weak and exaggerate their own production capacity. On January 19th, the head of the U.S. War Production Board, Charles Wilson, announced that 100,000 aircraft would need to be produced in 1944. However, the actual number of aircraft produced in various parts of the United States was 125,000. This shows that the U.S. government does not have an accurate estimate of its own production capacity. At the same time, it can also be seen that the labor force (productivity) used by the United States has now reached its maximum limit. As for Japan's productivity, it is now booming, and harnessing the power of domestic youth has only been a matter of recent months. For example, last November, when enemy air forces attacked Kaohsiung, thanks to the active and courageous counterattack by our air force, the enemy planes could only wander in the suburbs of Kaohsiung, injuring only three civilians. Therefore, in the future, Japan will simply laugh off the false propaganda of the British and Americans before the war. We only need to look at the situation after the air raid on Kaohsiung to understand everything clearly.</p>
<p>I have also read the remarks made by Mr. Chen, the president of Shen Bao, yesterday. What I find most ridiculous is that Chongqing willingly endures the pressure of the British and Americans, using Northwest resources to supply them, and using Chinese territory as a base for British and American aggression. This is no different from issuing a blank check, which is just empty happiness. Based on this, we can determine what Chongqing's fate will be. Oriental peoples place great importance on integrity, and we are concerned about Chongqing's behavior.</p>

<p>Yesterday's News Broadcast Time: 7:30 PM Reiterate Wartime Savings</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Reiterate Wartime Savings</h3>
<p>Yesterday's commentary on wartime savings, titled "National Savings Movement," argued that those leading the national savings movement must painstakingly and diligently study various novel and organized countermeasures, and must place emphasis on absorbing funds from the source of the national economy. Only in this way can the people "economize as much as possible, practice thrift, accumulate little by little, to enrich construction funds and expand the scope of production," as stated by Minister of Finance Zhou the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Promoting savings is by no means just launching a few propaganda weeks and superficially depositing funds into the Central Reserve Bank. It involves various organized and practically beneficial savings countermeasures, such as the progress of wartime national savings in the allied nation of Japan, and the improvement and expansion of its savings institutions. Japan is very diligent in promoting its national savings incentive movement. Its various savings plans and organizations that we can learn from include: the national savings association system, including the organization of regional associations in cities, towns, and villages; the implementation of incentive savings methods, such as various savings institutions receiving tax benefits; the creation of savings bonds, allowing those who are unable to purchase government bonds to cooperate in saving, so the government itself issues bonds to encourage long-term savings deposits; abandoning the principles previously not operated by various financial institutions, and mobilizing ordinary banks nationwide to operate savings and trust businesses; the implementation of a savings tax payment system, closely linking tax payment and savings. Under such diligent promotion and adjustment, Japan's wartime national savings often show a leap in growth, thus greatly assisting its huge war expenses and production expansion funds. These are all things that our country, both government and people, should strive to imitate in order to make the savings movement fully effective.</p>
<h3>Agreement Reached on New Year's Eve Settlement, All Industries Pass New Year Safely, Discount Interest Allowed Until Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The day after tomorrow (the 24th) is Lunar New Year's Eve. Various silver and money industries have already begun to handle the final settlement. The market discount interest rate is allowed to open until tomorrow (the 23rd). Various firms will settle interest with customers until the day before yesterday. During the final account period, no interest is calculated on deposits, but interest is still calculated on debts. Both are calculated according to a deposit interest rate of 6 yuan and a debt interest rate of 33 yuan. Regarding the time for receiving and returning checks on New Year's Eve, the Silver Union Association and the Money Bank have reached an agreement that the check exchange time will be extended that day. The principle is to return all checks on the same day. It is also heard that the banking industry will be closed for three days from the 25th and will reopen on the 28th. The money industry will be closed for four days from the 25th and will reopen on the 29th. All industries in the market are scheduled to open red market trading on January 29th. Regarding the business of various industries in the 32nd year, due to the soaring prices, many have made huge profits. In addition, the Central Reserve Bank and the Silver Union Association's Money Bank have tried their best to regulate, so various banks and firms are able to cope with ease, and all industries are passing the New Year safely.</p>

<p>All Sectors Respond Enthusiastically to Scholarships</p>
<p>Yesterday, a letter was received from Sun Xianhui and Guang Sheng, which stated: "The cost of living is high, school tuition fees are increasing, and many young people will be dropping out of school in society. I have long sympathized with the scholarship initiative organized by your newspaper. However, my strength is weak, and this wish has not been fulfilled. Now, I am persuading friends and relatives who are able to contribute to donate a total of 20,000 yuan to fulfill my responsibility. I hope you will accept it." We deeply admire his concern for young people. We are also grateful for the donations of 10,000 yuan each from Juxing Cotton Cloth Company and Ms. Sun Liu Wanru, and 5,000 yuan from Mr. Wu Yuanmao.</p>
<p>Former Xi Fan Enthusiastically Supports Scholarships</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Xi Fan was deeply moved by the repeated appeals in the newspaper for impoverished students to avoid dropping out of school. In addition to the previous donation from the Kuang Society, he has now donated another 10,000 yuan, with himself donating 5,000 yuan and the members of the Kuang Society donating a combined 5,000 yuan. According to Mr. Yuan, a Xi Fan Scholarship Fund Management Committee has also been established in his hometown of Zhenjiang to support local students who have dropped out of school. We deeply admire Mr. Yuan's repeated donations and fundraising efforts for this scholarship and his shared passion for those who have dropped out of school.</p>

<h3>Crackdown on Long-Term Promissory Notes Will Be Handled According to the Original Law, Reports of Accommodation and Changes Are Not Accurate</h3>
<p>The Financial Affairs Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank previously issued measures to crack down on the abuse of long-term promissory notes by various banks and firms, ordering them to comply. The report yesterday that the Silver and Money Industries Associations had proposed four measures for the Financial Affairs Inspection Department to adopt, and that the department had agreed to accommodate them, is now denied by the Financial Affairs Inspection Department. It stated that the department's crackdown on the issuance of long-term promissory notes by banks and firms will still be handled according to the original measures, and there is no so-called accommodation or change.</p>
<h3>Overdrafts on Current Accounts Must Be Cleared Annually, Financial Affairs Inspection Department Orders Banks to Comply</h3>
<p>The Financial Affairs Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank has noted that various financial institutions are supposed to clear all overdrafts for current and current accounts annually at the end of the Lunar New Year. However, it has recently been found that some accounts have not yet been cleared at the end of the year, which is improper. Therefore, they should be strictly urged to clear all overdrafts to maintain the established practice and uphold credit. Yesterday, separate letters were sent to various banks, money shops, and trust companies to comply. If there are any that cannot be cleared, please list the names of the accounts in detail (stating the account name, real name, accurate address, and amount of the overdraft) and report them to the Financial Affairs Inspection Department for verification.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Government Bonds: The market closed on Thursday and will reopen on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks: Due to the Spring Festival market closure, over-the-counter transactions were limited. Tight credit conditions led to some selling, but buyers were hesitant to make purchases, so the market was stable with a slight hint of volatility.</p>
<p>Discount Interest: Due to the final settlement, various industries must balance their positions, so credit conditions were tight and the discount interest rate remained at two cents.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: Recently, due to the increase in household rice, the appetite of merchants in this street has been sluggish, and prices have continued to decline. Bo Dao rice was trading at two levels three and four, while glutinous rice was more popular, trading at two levels five and six.</p>
<p>Woolens: Due to various environmental factors, the market remained popular, and new high prices were frequently seen. However, trading was limited due to the final settlement. Retail sales were scarce, and merchants with limited inventory mostly hoarded goods. Except for a few who slightly lowered prices to balance their positions, most were reluctant to sell. The lack of woolens, cotton, silk, and cotton yarn, as well as raw cotton, made the market particularly popular.</p>

<h3>Labor Education for Students at Normal University</h3>
<p>Discussions on labor education have always been theoretical, and the so-called labor in schools has been nothing more than child's play. True labor education must involve genuine labor.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of winter this year, coal prices have soared. Currently, 1,000 catties of hard coal cost as much as 90 yuan. The price increase is partly due to a shortage of workers and the rising cost of workers' rations. Fortunately, there has recently been a rationing system where residents can purchase coal at suburban coal yards with their household registration certificates, at a price of just over 40 yuan per 1,000 catties. However, the number of coal yards is limited, and the number of purchasers is extremely high, so some people are still unable to buy coal.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of coal rationing, there is also an interesting measure related to labor education.</p>
<p>The military-managed Mentougou Coal Mining Company recently agreed with Normal University to imitate the wartime labor education system of temples in Japan and Germany, whereby students from Normal University would handle coal rationing and transportation during their spare time to ease the fuel supply, and to demonstrate a spirit of labor. This has been underway since New Year's Day this year. It is said that Normal University students are currently working diligently, and the coal rationing department has already prepared some of the necessary coal transport carts, with plans to have some of the coal transported by Normal University students starting from the 10th of this month. Furthermore, a commencement ceremony for the Normal University students' diligent service will be held at 9:00 AM on the 9th of this month at the department's coal storage yard outside Heping Gate. All staff of the department, as well as the president and secretary-general of Normal University, the manager of Mentougou Coal Mining Company, Mr. Shirashima, and other related parties will attend. This is truly an interesting organization, and one that is worth noting. This kind of measure can be considered genuine labor education. (Posted by Luo Ming on January 15th)</p>

<h3>Excessively Collected Land Tax - Please Investigate Thoroughly, Municipal Authorities</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau of this city began collecting the land tax for the 32nd year on September 1st of last year, and if not paid by the end of October, a late payment penalty of 10% would be charged. In Yangjing District, Pudong, my hometown, the grain tax notification slips were not issued to the grain households by the baozheng (local head) until early November, after the payment deadline. Without the notification slips, payment was not allowed. Currently, the baozheng are collecting 50 yuan per mu from the farmers, resulting in the amount actually collected being more than three times the tax amount that should be collected, causing widespread suspicion. Therefore, disputes are often heard during payment. Furthermore, 1.5 sheng of military rice is collected per mu. Those with rice pay in rice, and those without rice pay in cash at the government-fixed price. Since the government's fixed price for each shi of rice is 820 yuan, 1.5 sheng translates to only 12.2 yuan in reserve certificates per mu. However, the baozheng are pricing it at 40 yuan, using the black market rate of over 2,660 yuan, resulting in an overcollection of more than three times (the municipal government buys white rice from farmers at a fixed price of 820 yuan per shi, while farmers have to pay for military rice based on the black market rate, which is unacceptable). It is certain that unscrupulous baozheng are overcollecting and engaging in fraud. I respectfully request that the municipal authorities investigate thoroughly and strictly deal with this. It would be best to publish in the newspaper the amount collected for both land tax and military rice so that payers can follow it appropriately, avoid being deceived by unscrupulous baozheng, and eliminate corruption and clarify governance. The farmers would be fortunate. (Tang Jingeng, a farmer from Yangjing District, Pudong)</p>

<h3>Noodle and Cooked Food Industry Entrusts this Office to Distribute Steamed Buns, Two per Person Until Supplies Last</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Noodle Food Industry Association, led by Chairman Wang Bing, once again dispatched Yao Jinbiao and Dai Ziquan as representatives to the Penglai Road Social Welfare Bureau Relief Institute, the Shanghai Special Municipality Winter Relief Association's Relief Centers, and other locations to distribute noodle-based flatbreads and steamed bun food products to benefit the poor. Today, they will set out again to donate to various relief organizations to benefit the impoverished. Furthermore, Mr. Wei Guishan, an advisor to the association, sent 500 catties of flatbreads and steamed buns, instructing that they be distributed at the entrance to impoverished students. Impoverished scholars from all walks of life are welcome to bring their citizen certificates to the Social Service Department of the "Jin Bao" newspaper to claim them, two per person until supplies last, and to create good fortune for colleagues in the cake-making industry.</p>
<h3>Eye Welfare</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Eye Relief Association provides monthly assistance to over one hundred impoverished blind individuals. As the Lunar New Year approaches, to show extra consideration, they are issuing double the usual amount to add a little something. According to reports, former directors Xu Heyong, Ji Longtu, and others, due to their advanced age and inability to manage affairs concurrently, publicly recommended Mr. Li Shuming to take over as director. Directors Huang Jiping, Ke Wennong, Chen Changping, Zhou Yixing, Wang Zhiyuan, Chuan Huai琛, Zhao Hongru, Zhang Zaichun, and others serve as executive directors and directors. Monthly donations are determined by the board of directors and are not solicited from outside, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Elderly Home is About to Run Out of Food</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Nanshi Elderly Home was founded by Catholic nuns and has a history of 39 years. Any poor and helpless elderly person, aged 60 or older, regardless of gender or religion, can be admitted. However, due to limited resources, it only accepts 250 people. The elderly home is currently in its most critical period, facing the food problem for four hundred lonely elderly people. Since the home has no endowment fund and lacks production, it relies solely on donations for its livelihood. Each month, it needs at least 55 bags of rice, about 10 tons of coal, 90 catties of oil, 250 catties of salt, 300 catties of beans, 650 catties of salted fish, 1,500 catties of vegetables, 2 boxes of soap, and at least 20 bolts of cloth. Other expenses, such as electricity, water, medicine, etc., require at least tens of thousands of yuan per month. These daily expenses are all raised by the nuns through daily solicitations. Please, benevolent individuals from all walks of life, generously donate. This office can collect donations on behalf of the home. (Xu Zongze)</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<h3>Soldier Class (2)</h3>
<p>During that year's summer vacation, Kikuchi, assigned to the officer corps, organized a military observation tour, personally leading over sixty aspirants to travel through Kyushu and China. As Makoto had already made up his mind, he also participated. Tatsuo and Komori were, of course, present.</p>
<p>Their group began their tour with the Kumamoto Garrison Division, the hometown of Major Kikuchi. The training of the troops under the blazing sun was indeed extremely intense. The backs of their uniforms were soaked as if with a wet towel.</p>
<p>They went to the army hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers of the Manchurian Incident and to console the bereaved families of the war dead. Their activities were indeed very busy, and there was also instruction from Major's car. He provided guidance on the preliminary knowledge of the places being visited at any time, and the relevant spiritual concepts. Because the cars were traveling at high speed, some people began to doze off. That cannot be entirely attributed to their lack of concentration, because this tour group had almost never stayed in a hotel, but rather spent the nights in the cars. Therefore, the students appeared very tired. Major's goal was to make them persevere.</p>
<p>"Strengthen yourselves, strengthen yourselves." Although he did not say it aloud, it could be seen in his eyes.</p>
<p>The final destination of the tour was the Etajima Naval Academy. At 6:00 AM, they arrived in Ujina City and boarded a transport ship from Kawaharash. Large and small warships, illuminated by the morning glow, were neatly moored. Tatsuo, roused from his dream, walked to the railing, while Makoto, peeking through the gaps between his friends, stared wide-eyed.</p>
<p>After arriving at Ujina, they walked for about thirty minutes to the gate of the Naval Academy. Major Kikuchi went to the gatekeeper and spoke a few words, and the gatekeeper notified his superior by telephone.</p>
<p>After a while, the major returned to the students: "Gentlemen, it is very unfortunate that this school began its summer vacation yesterday. But the duty officer will lead us on a tour. Everyone, please be orderly."</p>
<p>The students were all dejected. But they were also shocked to hear that the school's summer vacation was only ten days long!</p>
<p>An officer in a white naval lieutenant uniform appeared at the gate to lead them. Although it was during the holiday, the clean school, with its pine, cedar, and cherry trees, and the backdrop of the azure sea, did not feel like a school, but rather was filled with a clean atmosphere.</p>
<p>After about two hours, they had walked all over the place. Such a vast campus and school buildings. In addition, there were new school buildings under construction. Finally, before opening their lunch boxes for a meal at the Yōkōkan student hotel, the officer gave a lecture, the topic of which was "Regarding the Imperial Naval Academy."</p>
<p>"Great! The Navy - I didn't know there would be such new school buildings when I entered the school." Tatsuo whispered in Makoto's ear. Makoto just smiled and said nothing.</p>
