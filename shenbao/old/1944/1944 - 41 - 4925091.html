<h3>社評　歐洲戰局與政局</h3>
<p>甲：這幾天歐洲的戰局似乎相當沉悶，您的觀察如何？</p>
<p>乙：近來歐戰，確在微妙發展中。一方面是蘇聯的冬季攻勢，快要發展到最高潮階段了，前途大可注意；另一方面，所謂第二戰綫的空氣，正日趨濃厚，歐局正向決戰階段急進，所以，你說的沉悶也許是暴風雨前的沉寂吧！</p>
<p>甲：日昨看到二月四日的朝日新聞，據說東綫蘇軍，將攻勢重點，分在中部，南部及北部，向德軍防綫的脆弱部分猛進，德方目前尙未許樂觀。可是，如果說英美乘此時機推進西歐攻勢就會使德國戰力遭受威脅，恐怕還是一種言過共實的錯覺吧？</p>
<p>乙：是的。所以我們在觀察戰局時，還必須注意戰局後面英美蘇聯間微妙的政治關係及其動向。就蘇聯方面看，他們一方面督促英美開闢第二戰綫，但另一方面則仍抱自決主義，盡力推進，以圖在第二戰綫結成前，造成某種旣成事實，以便暢行其對付歐洲的世界政策。所以已與冬季攻勞相呼應，積極展開其對歐政治攻勢。</p>
<p>甲：怪不得近來報章粉載蘇聯最高蘇維埃開會，决定賦予參加蘇聯的各邦以外交及軍事的獨立權了，原來蘇聯是希望用這一套新政治攻略來對付英美啊！</p>
<p>乙：蘇聯這種決策，自然使英美乃至世界爲之驚駭，他對參加聯邦的各國旣可允許其自建國防軍自辦外交，那麼所給歐洲若干小國的影響可就不少，尤其是關於波蘇糾紛問題等，着實使英美下台不得！</p>
<p>甲：自然，蘇聯這種新舉措，共主要的對象是歐洲各小國，企圖煽起叛亂，便利其攻勢的推進。不過這種政治攻勢，對於德國可起不了什麼作用，這幾天來東歐巴爾幹各國之沉默，正可看到成功的另有其入。不過，奇怪的是外間竟有關於芬蘭的謠傳！</p>
<p>乙：原因也很簡單，美國對於芬蘭，一直未會放手過。現在蘇聯展開其政治攻勢，英美在感受威脅之餘，無可奈何，姑且將計就計，對芬蘭問題用些功夫！可是謠言最怕事實，事實在幾天內就會答復，也許就不必驚異了。</p>
<p>甲：不錯，昨天報上已有德國闢斥一切和議謠傳的消息了。我看在這歐戰決戰前夕旣有英美蘇間這一套政治與外交的把戲，那麽，你剛纔所說歐局正向決戰急進之說，不能不有所懷疑！</p>
<p>乙：這是你過分估計反軸心內部矛盾的原故。實在，英美蘇三國隨着戰局之發展而其政治關係也將遇到限界，固然是事實，這不僅是他們三國勢力關係問題，實在也是政治的思想的對立問題。威爾基之流的宣示蘇聯西進與英美危幾，就是指此。然而生今日，英美已經無去　脫其悲劇的命運之索，他們有非　速展開西歐攻勢不可的苦痛。所謂「鋌而走險」，一點也不錯！</p>
<p>甲：可是，德國正在順利實踐共「保持戰力」之策略，看吧，他會給進攻西歐的冒險者以怎樣的答覆</p>
<h3>阿拉坎戰事熾烈　日機猛襲敵陣地　軍事設施三處被炸起大火</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　據緬甸日軍某基地十三日電：阿拉坎戰綫戰事近來異常劇烈，日陸軍機十一日夜會轟炸敵某基地，敵軍事設施三處被炸起火，同時納夫河之敵運轍船亦中彈起火。又其他機隊亦曾大舉進攻孟多東方之敵軍某地，予潰走中之敵軍以重創，並使地上二處起火，日機則全部安返基地。</p>

<p>低機襲九江</p>

<h3>歐洲要塞的攻防戰　（六）</h3>
<p>朝日新聞座談會</p>
<p>朝日新聞社　巴爾幹作戰遲早將南義戰綫，第二戰綫相呼應而即將實行。英美蘇將從那方向前來攻擊呢？</p>
<p>笹本特派員（柏林（自去　年十一月以來，英美接續轟炸薩洛尼加方面　及蘇斐亞。自一月十五日起的一週間，對達爾瑪堤亞接績轟炸。滬暴露了英美對巴爾幹的虎視耽耽。然去年十月十一月，英美軍在雷奧斯，薩摩斯的多島海基地被德軍占領之後，敵方喪失了對特拉基亞，及希臘半島的基地，此方面的作戰非常困難。於是在英美的巴爾幹作戰上，比較容易的區城祗有達爾瑪堤亞海岸。這區域的登陸，跟着英美軍在義大利的北上，而其可能性漸趨擴大。</p>
<p>德軍對敵力對達爾瑪堤亞的企圖，早巳籌有對策。敏速收拾巴陀里奧退出時的危機，占領科爾天島及其他巴陀里奧軍守備下的各島，嚴密戒備。</p>
<p>巴爾幹動向</p>
<p>朝日新聞社反軸心方面正在使用謀略戰，使巴爾幹諸國脫離軸心，其目標爲土耳其，保加利亞，洪牙利等。那麼，土耳其會立在反軸心方面參戰嗎？</p>
<p>笹本　土耳共今日客觀的情勢，不能僅由自己的意志决定其行動，土耳其自已也認識得很淸楚。</p>
<p>那麼，土耳其將在何種塲合參戰呢？第一，英美軍的巴爾幹作戰，縱不直接要求土耳其的軍事協力，但勢將要求使用土耳其境內的海空軍基地，承認軍隊假道。道塲合，德軍將立即對之反攻。第二，一面英美從於土耳其無關係的達爾瑪堤亞登陸進攻巴爾幹，一面則紅軍侵入羅馬尼亞，更南下而使巴爾幹陷於混亂。這塲合，土耳其在維持巴爾幹秩序的名義上，協力英美軍有所行動。</p>
<p>但德軍正在巴爾幹嚴陣以待，與德軍正面衝突，在土耳其是非常危險的。土耳其也很知進遭一點。英美考慮到將來的對蘇間題時，亦不希望土軍的主力被德軍擊滅。所以第二個說法成爲參戰之有力的原因。</p>
<p>朝日新聞社　保加利亞的動向如何？</p>
<p>梅田保加利亞志在恢復失地，建設大保加利亞。但在國內親蘇的感情很高，是不與蘇聯交戰的唯一的斯拉夫國。但夾在德蘇之間，保加利亞亦不免受英美的恐怖空襲，該國在最近半年間所受精神的困苦，實值得同情。</p>
<p>朝日新聞社　洪牙利的狀態—</p>
<p>梅田　洪牙利無論從經濟上看來，作戰上看來是德國進出巴爾幹的大門。兩國不僅因以前的傳統而結合起來，而且是非協力不可的運命。義大利政變後的今日，洪牙利不能不相當努力以謀政治的安定。但政府反對派的勢力也相當強，受一百五十萬少數猶太民族的支持，而政府迄未公布關於抑止猶太人之基木法令。另一困難是與羅馬尼亞之間所動的領土的懸案。這些都是將來很難解決德·這許多巴爾幹國家，由多瑙河而堅固的結合起來，成爲歐洲新秩序的礎石之日，即將降臨。（完）（翔：譯二自月四日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>黨工訓練團　第一期開學</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　中國國民黨中央執行委員會，爲適應决戰體制，增進黨務工作人員之能力，以謀黨務之强化，而完成興華保亞之使命起見，特舉辦「中央黨務工作人員訓練團」，分三期調訓各級黨部工作人員入團受訓。第一期調訓中央黨部中級工作人員（科長專員總幹事等）。曁各省市黨部及各特別黨部委員會記長，第二期調訓各省市黨部及各特別黨部中級工作人員，（科長總幹事等）暨各縣市區（特別市黨部暨特別黨部）黨部委員，第三期議訓各雀市黨部及特別黨部下級工作人員，（幹事助理幹事）曁各區黨部省區分部委員，所有調訓人員，均由中央每期受訓，期問爲六個星期，團長由主席兼任，並經指定中央組織部長陳春圃爲敎育長，副部長戴英夫爲　敎育長。另設訓練委員會，爲集團訓練之設計及指導機構，除主任委員由敎育長兼任外，經奉指派巫蘭　爲副主任委員，周學昌，沈爾喬，鄒敬芳，戴英夫，陳昌祖，陳允文，汪曼雲，孔憲　，戴策，馮節，郭秀峰，張克昌，何廷楨，武仙卿等爲委員。此外，又派武仙卿，劉勝天，高天樓，古泳今，許國祿，張潤三，張瀛曾，華漢光，許惕生等担任該團導師，茲悉第一期定明（十五）日開學，所有各地調訓人員，均限於今（十四）日報到。</p>
<h3>農業增產會制定　增產策進綱要</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　行政院農業增產策進委員會自成立以來，對增產工作之推進方策，積極釐訂規定，以期在統一指導策進卜，得以順利推進，茲悉該　刻已制定一農業增產策進綱要」，以爲推進工作準繩，該項綱要內容在確立整個增產方案，審訂全國及各省市農業增產計劃，集中資金，以勵行增產，同時預定在蘇浙皖三省京滬兩市選定治安良好推行便利之三十縣，以利用各地合作社分支社及生產互助社各鄕鎭農事協進會等底層機構，協同推動增產工作，更充實各農塲內容，以爲農民之鏡鑑。至於增產之農作對象，約分三類，一爲食糧作物各米麥等，二爲油脂作物谷油類篦麻等，三爲纖維作物各棉花麻類等，爲使農民自發了解改良農事與增產之關係，當局隨時予以協助，各調整各農作物之收買價格，攷　對農用及日常生活品之配給圓滑，對增產優良者，予以獎勵，廢除剝削農氏之苛捐雜稅等，務達人盡其力，地盡其利，故該綱要頒佈實施後，達到安定民生確保軍需兩大目的，必可預卜。又該會更製定本年度緊急增產對　推進預定表，督飭各有關機關按定實施務期於成。</p>
<h3>英軍事使團返國　英士談判停頓　土決定防衛國土措施</h3>
<p>里斯木十三中央社電　據安加拉訊：英軍事使節　與土耳共參謀木部，曾於過夫一月問秘密舉行軍事會談後，因故陷於他頓狀態，故英軍事團已由林特賽及朋利望兩將軍率領，自安加拉啓程首途返英。會談停頓之原因，似因英國對土供給軍需品問題未能圓滿解抉所致。據消息靈通方面傅，英國欲將鹵獲品供給土軍，但土方則以其違反安達那及開羅會談之宣布將赴英返任，然每次均因兩國軍事會談血吿延期，現該大已抉定十四日夜啓程返倫敦任所。同時土駐伊朗</p>
<p>里斯木十三日中央社電　據安加拉你：土政府爲防衛國土起見，最近已向議會提出於必要時，得將征用土地及建築物之權交與土耳其陸軍之法案。</p>

<h3>日定期調查　全國人口</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日政府定於本月二十三日開始調查本年度木國人口，此項調查適於决戰時期施行，故極具重要性。當局布望於此次調查中，於動員兵力，動員產業戰士，增强輸送戰量圓滑配給食糧等實施上，製成正確資料。內閣統計局以十二日起至二十日止十日內，派調查員以中吿書用紙普遍分配各家，調查區內戶數。聞調查時刻爲二月二十日上午零時·調查事項規定住所姓名，性別，年齡·配偶有無職業·從業上之地位·及兵役關係等八項。</p>
<h3>白宮舉行　軍事會議</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據海通社訊，華盛頓消息，羅斯福總統昨日接見新開記者後，與陸海軍參謀人員，商議納吐諾戰局，參謀長馬歇爾將軍。美艦隊總司令金上將。陸軍航空隊司令阿諾爾特將軍·美參謀長李希匕將·均在白宮參加會議。華感頓軍事專家稱，羅斯福會晤高級將領，顯示反軸心軍在義國遭遇之困難，未可估討過低。</p>
<h3>布格河上游　坦克大會戰　爭奪加巷戰進行中</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十三日電烏克蘭戰綫蘇軍第一第二軍協力下，對契爾喀塞西方德軍展開圍攻，迄十二日益趨激烈。蘇軍覆由達干齊及密羅普利埃兩方面猛攻契爾喀賽西方據點科爾斯尼。據蘇聯情報局十二日夜公報稱，德軍不斷由歇希柯夫東方出動戰車步兵之大軍猛烈反攻。又德蘇兩單戰車約一千五百輛，曾於十二日再布格河上流展開空前決戰。據路透社莫斯科電。曼斯坦軍正不斷增援，對攻擊科爾斯尼之蘇軍背後以車大威脅，戰局之歸趨殊難預測。又北部戰綫蘇軍在盧加方面確保列寗格勒巴迭卡亞及莫斯科鐵道後，更謀西進奪回盧加，但經德軍於盧加東部將蘇軍之進攻阻止，刻正展開激烈巷戰中。</p>
<h3>日國民儲蓄額　必可順利完成</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日本本年度國民儲蓄目標額，已於十二日閣議中决定爲三百六十億元，常日下午已由情報局正式發表。關於增加國民儲蓄事，賀屋藏相主張甚爲積極，曾於此次議會中說明根據國家資金立塲，以木年公債資金二百八十五億元，擴充生產資金六十億元，及整頓企業而放出之資金約七億元，總計三百五十億元，必須自本年國民總收入之六百億元中籌劃。其後又在議會中主張，鍵於目下購買力，極應積極吸收國民私有資金，乃在三百五十億元之外，更加價普通私有資金吸收額十億元，决定木年　國民貯蓄目標定爲三百六十億元，此數較去年之二百七十億元增多九十億元。去年目標額順利完威，木年爲决勝年，日木全國國民素以然誠爲國踴躍輸將見稱，諒木年貯蓄目標必可予以完成。</p>

<h3>電車公司調整　各項實施辦法</h3>
<p>十六日起分別實行</p>
<p>中央社訊　上海電車公司，爲統一票價，杜絕賣票揩油，改良行駛路錢起見，曾對上各點，分別加以調整，並定自本月十六日起實行。茲特分誌該公司各項實施辦法如次：</p>
<p>統一車資</p>
<p>該公司對本市有軌及無軌之各路電車票價，於本月十六日起，將以前原有之區間制票價，完全加以廢止，實施每一路綫遠近一律制之票價，計頭等一元（軍人劵五角），三等一律五角（軍人劵三角）。至於月季票價，則分爲全綫（各路通用）及一綫用（指定一路用）二種，其價格如下：（頭等）大人全綫每月一六○元，三個月三八五元。一綫每月八○元，三个月一九五元。小人全綫每月八○元。一线每月四○元。（三等）大人全綫每月八○元。一綫每月四○元。若公司商號機關等集有廿人以上，經詐請後，該公司能給予優待之折扣。並悉對本（二月份之月季票，則仍能照前通用，無須增價</p>

<h3>兜銷印花稅票　嚴厲查禁</h3>
<p>稅局函警局協助</p>
<p>江蘇印花煙酒稅局，近日　據密報，有人在外假借名義，向居民商店兜銷印花稅票，殊屬違反稅政必致影響整個稅收。是以昨日特分函本市各警察總局，轉飭所屬各分局，在各該管轄境內，予以協助。隨時查禁，如有發現即行拘案嚴懲，以資整備，而杜流弊。</p>

<h3>體育　慈善足球賽第二幕　中華敗於葡</h3>
<p>比數四對三</p>
<p>上海足球聯合會主辦之慈善足球賽第二幕，中華戰葡萄牙，於昨晨十時半在逸園球塲舉行，裁判玄谷正柱，葡萄牙能以四對三敗中華，决非僥倖。中華以四對三失敗。亦非寃枉，雖中華力圖挽回頹勞，無奈寡不敵衆，（中華僅以十人應戰）葡萄牙守門A羅柴遼，身手矯健，履救險球，與昔判若二人。該隊之勝，皆賴羅柴遼之功·V蘇若指揮三軍，頭頭是道，前線五鋒成一人之天下。馬小兒究不愧老將風度、方位阻擋，厥功甚偉，大虫法凡笑亦屬不弱，餘子均在水準以上。中華在開幕十分鐘際，劉祖備負傷離塲，故僅十人應戰，中華隊以東華全部人馬爲基礎，輔以三省之麥爾森，聯誼諸將均未臨陣，個人技術，以韓龍海爲最佳，出將入相·漢塲飛奔。譚福　未見精彩，買幼良雖屬　勇，而失卻二次絕好機會，功　一簣。張邦綸令人大失所望。中華所以敗北，邦綸應負一半責任。上半時舊萄牙以三對一領前，下半時中華扳回兩球。至於塲前，葡又獲一球，結果四對一，中華失敗。</p>

<h3>經濟界　華北蘇淮貿易商　同業公會成立</h3>
<p>促進南北物資交流</p>
<p>本市與華北蘇淮進出口貿易，年有鉅額成交，且於南北物資交流關係至鉅。茲特經有關當局指導下，於昨（十三）日在滬成立華北及蘇淮進出口貿易商兩同業公會，均假貴州路湖社舉行成立大會。各機關長官計到商統會俞處長朗西，陳科長　君，經濟局張主任志明，士商會周鴻聲等。上午十　成立蘇淮進出口貿易同業公會，主席團金致公趙紀新陳竹生等，即席報告籌備經過，並通過章程草案，最優選舉　監事人選。下午一時成立華北進出口貿易同業公會，主席團張競立金致公孟　泰王　董　生等全體形體如儀後，即席報告及選舉　監人選，歷二小時始畢。</p>

<h3>財部準銀錢業請求　增資期限放寬</h3>
<p>截止本年三月底爲止</p>
<p>財政部爲加强銀錢業金融機構，自規定凡不兼營儲蓄信託業務之銀行錢莊，須將資本總額增至六百萬元，並得先行收足二分之一以後，各行莊均已遵令辦理。其增資吿竣呈請財部變更註冊之時。均由銀錢業公會將其增資數額查核明確，給以證明文件。並因增資限期，原定三十二年十二月底爲止，而各行莊中有以年度結束時之盈餘分配股東，移作增資之用者，迫於限期未免經辦不及，因此由兩公會會呈財部將增資限期酌予展長。旋奉批准，展至三十三年三月底爲止，自此期限放寬，可以從容辦理待各業增資全部完全後，機構當益見充貿，整個金融得以持久之穩定云。</p>
<h3>上週金融工商市況烚　赤公債市塲消減情況穩定</h3>
<p>滬市上週間金融與工商市况，因新春假滿開市後，銀錢業對於放款業務特予嚴愼處置，故銀根緊張始終未見鬆弛，交易未能展開，惟擁資者鑒於市况難呈活動，意受一般市儈慫恿投機，其烚赤公債等暗市不法交易，釀成市價高翔，人心惶惶不安。幸經常局查悉，即以斷然手段拘速不法之給赤及公債兩居間商，嚴予儆戒，當將給赤公債兩種黑市悉數消減，故而金融情況，益臻穩定。其股票市況亦經當局之嚴予查禁投機買賣，及取締非法股票上市，市價隨時請跌。工商各業　總結束前進貨充足，故交易微細，但因種種不良流言，物價則日益上漲不巳。現當局正注視取締各商擅自抬高售價，否則決予嚴厲懲處云。</p>
<h3>各同業公會　審查會員資格</h3>
<p>本市各主要商品同業公會　爲尅期機定物價起見，咸經分別召開理監事聯席會議。嚴格審查同業會員資格，　營業性價，零售抑批發。　經售物品種類，應否加入該會爲會員，與該會章程抑有抵觸。　對公會所訂限價，及各項措置有否遵守。　該會員門市所需現貨係貨成交手續如何，　會員中抑有運用不合標準之度量衡量器等點。倘公認某一會員有不遵照上述各點其中之一者。即令其退會，停止享受各項機利。</p>
<h3>二次儲蓄運動　延長一週</h3>
<p>中央儲蓄銀行主辦之第二次儲備週，決定自今（十四）日起至十九日止繼續延長一週，以期有志者得能參加有獎儲蓄之機會。聞銀行錢莊兩業同業公會已通函各會員行莊，如在一月十七日起至一月二十二日止儲蓄週期內未認定儲蓄定期存款數額者，務於本週內一律認儲足額。</p>
<h3>煤渣業公會　擬訂業規</h3>
<p>上海特別市煤渣號業同業公會爲謀同業福利，統一煤渣市價，已在積極擬訂「同業買賣業規」，賊日送呈主管當同　案，以後各會員同業，必須遵循該會所訂草則交易，不得陽水陰違。</p>

<p>阿拉伯海　日潛艇奮戰記</p>
<p>某月，印度洋的怒濤澎湃，使船上兵士大感困苦，我們的目標是從阿拉伯海，一路向西進攻某灣，發動進攻後。某日正午方過，在水平錢上發見了最初的獵物。不出我們的預料，遭遇到由可倫坡開出的敵船了。</p>
<p>敵機的哨戒，日趨劇烈，一萬噸級的運貨船，漸漸地映入潛望鏡中，打出去的魚雷、中了敵艦船橋前和船尾的地方，一瞬間船體傾沉下去。再過一會兒，船又恢復了平衡的姿態，褻出了急救信號的敵人，立刻放下兩艘小木船，開始逃亡。我們的艦長，决計在白天實施砲戰，命令準備急速浮上砲戰。平時的訓練，在這時候可儘量發揮了，立即對敵船加以猛烈的砲擊，砲彈們個打中，由船橋下起火焚燒起來，被黑烟包圍，漸漸沉入海中去了。</p>
<p>優待俘虜　據俘虜的船長說：這隻船本是荷蘭船，開戰忽忍，便奉英國的命令，檐任輸運軍用物資，這次正山可倫坡開往達班的途中。我們給他一個房間，和　塊　氈，以士官階級的　食款待他，並待以船長之禮。</p>
<p>在黑夜裏燈火亮了，　爲船近錫蘭島，恐怕有敵方飛行艇母艦在夜裏哨成，便馬上準備魚雷戰，但接近前邊一看，是敵方的病完船，雪白的船腹浮出紅十字記號。這大約是護送着在印細國境受傷的英兵，美英敵國，曾經襲　我病院船幾次，我們正抱着很大的遺恨，然而日本的海軍是爲正裏而戰着，便默默地放它過去，以期他日擊沉敵船。</p>
<p>白天浮出　突破了印度洋，阿拉伯海，進入目的地的某　來了。無論敵機的哨戒如何嚴密，爲要獲得偉大的戰果，艦長决意在白天浮上去，而在廣闊的視野中，可以迅速地發見敵船，艦長便下令瞭望員嚴密警戒空中，自已守住司令塔，於是全艦的士氣大爲振奮。好幾次發見了敵機，便急速地潛杭下去。</p>
<p>有一天的黃昏，一萬噸的運貨船出港而來，到了夜間，因爲空氣迷　，忽然視野辨不淸楚。發射魚雷的準備已經妥當，艦長看一看潛望鏡之後，迫近敵船的時候，敵船不知道察覺與否，猛然變更方向，因此放過了好的機會，但是我艦立刻浮上海面追擎。不久，敵船的前部，遭受砲彈，似乎推進舵發生障礙，船便迥轉打圈，艦漸漸地往上，於是推進機顯露出來了。</p>
<p>艦長凝視着潛望鏡。將加以最後的一擊。但敵機兩架，接着信號飛來。因此打斷了攻擊的念頭，深深地潛入海中，不能目睹敵船最後的光景。不過君敵船的船首沈入海中，總也難免沈沒下去吧。後來雖然碰到敵船兩次，但因有敵機保護，也就失去加以襲擊的機會。</p>
<p>閃電攻擊　某次聽着警戒員的喊聲，艦長砲出　　一看，　中映出一萬噸級的運貨船，而且接近再看，知道那是假冒商輪的特設砲艦，前後部裝有大砲各一尊，中央裝置兩尊，聯裝機槍五挺。如果加以一擊，而沒有擊沈的話，便要遭受猛烈的反攻，所以艦長的發動襲擊的方針，菲常的愼重，魚雷也似乎有靈心一般，正中艦首和中央，瞬間發生大爆發，看看艦首傾沈，於是全船沈沒下去，這不過是幾分鐘的光景，連呼吸都還不過來的那樣快速的閃電攻擊啊。</p>
<p>宛如獰猛的獅子一般勇敢的艦長，不顧身上的危險，把盤船開到迫近某灣的　口，這時候果然發見很大的運輸船，差不多有戰艦一般的大，在太陽直射下的某灣，敵船料不到日本的潛永艦會到這裏來，艙板上舖張着幕布，大砲也蓋着。我們放出的魚雷，却中了艦橋的下面，滿裝戰着重油的敵船，沒有幾下，立時起火，這也僅費幾分鐘，便沈　下去。流出海上的重油，亦着了火，猛烈的海上火勢，漸次擴大範圍，呈出焦熱地獄的　愴光景。現在我長驅而來的潛水艦，在某　口樹立了光輝的成績了。在哨戒中的敵機，雖然向我們投下兩顆炸彈，也未打中。我們迅速地巧妙濟航下去，心裏覺得很滿意的，靜靜地在海底上行走着。（弘認自一月二十日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>波根維爾島　六次海空戰記</h3>
<p>距夏威夷大海戰紀念日很近的十二月三日，日本的海鷲（海軍飛機）又在所羅門海上建下了光榮的大戰績，擊沉敵方航空母艦三艘，戰艦曁大型巡洋艦各一艘，另有大型巡洋襤一艘及驅逐艦一艘似乎亦被擊沉，此外還有一艘戰艦被炸傷。這一次的大戰果，是繼十一月初旬以來波根維爾烏洋面航空戰歷次赫赫戰果之後的表明防衛南太平洋的日木海軍航空部隊奮戰情形的光輝左證，在海　戰史上史添燦爛的一頁。</p>
<p>敵軍機動部隊出現的報吿傳達到〇〇基地時，正是那日的淸晨。敵軍是以航空母艦及戰艦爲主幹的有力部隊。自從十一月十七日第五次波根維爾島洋面航空戰以來，引滿待放的海　們，一直注意敵軍的動靜，接擭這個報吿後，認爲是預期的事實出現，都懷着務必殲減敵軍的决心，撫着鐵腕，聽聆消息。一待命令下來，海鷲雷擊隊的出擊華備便迅速完成。敵軍在第一次到第五次的波島洋而航空戰中，雖已受到那樣大的損害，仍再激再厲地整頓陣容，向南方要錢挑戰，對於這種執拗的攻勢以及陸續出動的艦隊，非加以嚴重的打擎，使之繳減不可。</p>
<p>一一機幹掉一艦！魚雷必須命中，安閑地幹！」</p>
<p>在出擎以前，是日的指揮官〇〇大尉給予部下的訓辭甚短，但磅　其中的凜然氣魄，却傳出了堅强的信仰。未幾，出發的時刻已到。海鷲伸展銀翼，踴躍昇空。茲將在那日的攻擊中捨身奮戰，與友軍部隊共同擊潰敵軍航空母艦羣的海鷲雷擊隊勇士們所談的劇烈戰况，綜述如下。</p>
<p>海鷲出發　〇時〇分從基地出發的海鷲雷擊隊，向目的地的海面連翩前進。不久，南海的夕陽已沒入地平綫，西方天際的迴光，也漸漸淡薄，暮色徐徐　　深藍色的海面。片刻，前方望見　諾島的黑影。預定的戰塲便在那邊。我們嚴密瞭望海面，但未發見有像敵艦的東西。飛機一直向島飛去。突然，從陸地上射出探　燈的張光，而高射砲的彈幕也差不多回時在我們脚下展開，紛紛炸裂。幾架敵方戰鬥機從側而向我們進攻，我們一面用雲做掩護物，一面繼續搜案敵艦。不久，從斷雲間發見海面上有四。五隻敵軍運輸艦。它們竟也不自量地狂開高射砲。我們置之不理，繼續前進，眼望着海面，一瞬也不瞬。果然不久看見前方並列着黑黑的艦影，無疑是敵方的艦隊。一瞥之下，就和有十隻以上。周聞配置驅逐艦，前方及左右護以巡洋艦，中央則爲航空母艦。它們在黃昏的海上　起白波，向西北方航行。　睇遙望前方，更可眺見彷彿是戰艦的艦影。哈哈，我們要搜案的敵人終於發見了。時間正是薄暮，是展開攻擊的絕好時機的日沒後〇〇分。「全軍突擊！」指揮官機發下這個命令時，正是下午〇時〇〇分。食餌旣多，我們的編隊就馬上解散，各機分頭認定目標，紛紛突入。</p>
<p>這時，紅色的照明彈像鮮紅的提燈一般，高懸在敵方艦隊的上空。它是先行的索敵機投下的。常先突進的指揮官機，率領其餘海鷲，向這個火球所指的敵艦行列，猛然殺到。此時，已知我方襲擊的敵艦，一齊展開對空砲火的彈幕，爲了閃避我們的猛擊，高射砲和高射機關槍固不消　得，甚至連主砲也亂放起來。</p>
<p>一旦認定目標金圖發射魚雷的指揮官機，力求狙擊的正確，衝過鐵與火的鮮紅的　　，大胆地用全速掠過敵艦隊伍的正中，掉轉機官，再　反對的方向突掠敵艦。但指揮官〇〇大尉認爲角度尙不充分，所以再旋轉機首，改正航向，在最好的位置突入。不料另外一艘敵艦忽然出現在限前，受到了它的妨礙之後，不得不再行修正方向。這一次，飛出敵艦行列的前方，從左側間巨艦進攻，放出必殺無赦的魚雷。敵艦對於這架急旋回的指揮官機，集中更猛烈的砲火。</p>
<p>全軍突擊</p>
<p>此時，海上的暮色濘濃，天空幾乎空被雲霞所蔽。櫛似的弦月，時時從雲間透出俏全，將淡淡的光芒投射在海面上。雷擊隊的各機，步着指揮官機的後塵，各自肉薄目標，實行果敢的攻擊。敵艦的防禦砲火，愈來愈烈，不絕從海面噴冒火花，將航空母艦圍在當中，在海上描成火輪。這樣，在下全軍突擊的命令後約〇〇分，已有一隻敵艦被魚雷侖中，旋即從薄暗的海面消失了它的巨體。接着，一艘航空母艦也被必殺的魚雷命中，從艦的中央湧起一股沖天的火柱，它的甲板條成火海，接着全艦皆被烈火包住。二分鐘後，已有一隻航空母艦的艦腹碰到魚雷，轟然一擊，立刻發生大火災，鮮紅的烈焰直冲半空。還當兒，兩架友機在這激鬥中不幸受到敵彈，化成火圍，突入敵方的　　，完成了壯烈的字炸，發射魚雷完了的指揮官機，被彈二十處，汽油箱也被擊破，汽油一滴一滴向外流，但仍悠悠然翱翔戰塲的上空，直到查明以上的戰果，方才離開由敵軍航空母艦的熊熊火光照明的戰塲，凱旋基地。</p>
<p>在敵艦的猛烈砲火中，四次修正當擊的指揮官的轟轟烈烈的海鷲魂，是全體隊員都有的，其中有一架雷擊　，一定要幹掉敵方的航空母艦，猛然突進，覓取航空母艦，也不管對手所爲何事。在　着敵艦猛烈的防　砲火搜索航空母艦之問，預定的攻擊時間是過頭了，但是爲了期望放出的魚雷一發必中，不得不極其愼重，海上已很黑暗，連艦影也不大看得淸楚了，這架飛機仍舊左右盤旋，繼續搜尋理想中的目標，後來，前面的敵艦被　幾的巨彈命中，突然噴出熊熊的火焰，飛近去仔細察看，原來是一隻航空母艦。在這艘起火的航空母艦後方，還有一隻航空母艦，於是　定目標，實行突擊，放出必中的魚雷，閃開劇烈的防禦砲火，急急回轉。</p>
<p>雷擊命中</p>
<p>魚雷果然命中，轟然爆炸。接連兩次大爆發，震動了海面，火焰在航空母艦的甲板上向左右蔓延，一瞬間僅剩左舷的艦橋尙未焚燒，但不久也被波及，全艦終於包裏在火焰裏。這架雷擊機，從向敵艦隊伍突擊時起，到魚雷，倍見悽凉。（佐佐木特派員）（吉：譯自一月十二日每日新開）</p>

<h3>賊</h3>
<p>— 梁小萍</p>
<p>猛烈的西北風，帶着灰沙在街道上瘋狂的飛舞；天黑沉沉的板起臉，冷酷地。路上稀少的行人，手縮在袖管裏，肩槓得高高地。在寒風裏搏關。黃包車天拖了空的車輛，在街心蕩漾，覓候着呼喚的主顧。偶而馳過了一輛汽車，像一隻任着野性的猛獸，衝破了陰沉，帶來些一緊張的氣氛。</p>
<p>是一個冷靜，險森，缺乏生氣的初冬的傍晚。</p>
<p>老王在帳台上算帳，不時的打出枯燥的算盤聲；小毛伏在櫃台的一端打瞌睡，呼呼的睡得正熟；我坐在一角，低了頭默默地閱讀一本雜誌，心似乎浸涸在另一個世界裏，但我感到現實的窒息和沉悶。風撲進裏面來打旋，寒意緊緊地侵襲逼人。</p>
<p>偶然走進一個買客來，書架子上望了一陣，去出了。好一會，又進來了另一個，不經意地隨手翻了幾本，再揰上架子去，溜出去了。</p>
<p>周圍的空氣散漫，冰冷，凄凉。</p>
<p>一個藍色的影子，在我的眼簾裏閃了出去，　異的抬起頭來，瞥見最外的一格書架上，留了一塊空隙，是少去了一本書了</p>
<p>「賊」！我驚呼。陡的跳起身來，躍出店門：向北，是的，我約摸是看見閃向北的。小毛跟在我的後面奔了出來。</p>
<p>我躍在街道的中間，像搜索野味的獵犬的銳利的目光，掃向左，向右，向前，而且敏捷地向後。</p>
<p>藍色的長衫！脇下抰着一本厚厚的書籍！那本紅色面子的　氏比亞全集！現在在理髪店的門口站住了，貪婪地望望後面。我的步子加緊了，廻避了他的視綫，逼近他的身旁時，我狠命的撲上去，一手着力的抓住他的後領，另一手抓住他的一隻臂</p>
<p>「呵」！一聲驚惶的呼喊，拍的挾着的書本落在地上。小毛拾了起來，帮着抓住他的另一隻臂賻</p>
<p>幾下無謂的掙扎後，　絕望地看了我一限，頹然的垂下了頭，一個失敗的好漢似的，完全失去了反抗的能力。</p>
<p>「走」，我厲聲地呼喝，兩手抓得緊緊地，幾乎使盡了全部的氣力，雖然不再見他倔强地掙扎。僅僅穿着二重單薄的衣服，我感到抓住的是他的擊硬的骨幹；周身正打着戰慄，一陣陣的抖動我的手　。</p>
<p>在許多路人好奇的視綫的匯集下，勝利的驕傲浮在我的臉上煥發。思潮迅速地在我的腦際迥旋，血在周身奔騰，湧在臉上一陣陣的發熱。</p>
<p>「求求你放了我吧，我還是初次，實在因肚裏飢餓，沒有法子想」。顫聲地哀求。</p>
<p>我不理睬，沒有放鬆絲毫，並且咀咒這種低鄙，無恥的舉動。一步步推着他的身子暫向店裏走；將近店門了，老王伸長了頸鵠候着。</p>
<p>行人停止了脚步，圍攏來看，一層，二層，……</p>
<p>「求求你們幾位，放了我吧，我……」</p>
<p>「劈」「拍」，運續着　亮的兩下；「下次還敢來嗎」？老王氣憤憤的首先動手了。</p>
<p>「不來了，不來了。我還是……」</p>
<p>「劈」「拍」，又是二下，這會打的是隔壁的阿林，「他媽的，好好的生意不做，做這種事」。阿林直壯地說。</p>
<p>紅的在鼻子裏掛下來了；流到下巴底下，滴上階沿石上。</p>
<p>「唷！唷！求求你們放了我吧，我家裏還有…………」。</p>
<p>「　」「　」。沉重的拳頭，擊在背脊上怒吼；一下，二下，老王的拳頭，隔壁阿林的拳頭，小毛的拳頭，還加入了一個西　行人的拳頭；向着背脊，胸脯，頭部；雨點一樣的密，一樣的急。</p>
<p>「喔唷！救命，放了我吧，我不來了」，哀求，高聲地，顫抖地。像一隻受創後的狗的慘呌。</p>
<p>拳頭，雨點一樣的密，一樣的急；又加入了一隻互大的黑的皮鞋脚，向大腿，向股部亂踢。</p>
<p>突然被衝出了重國，跟蹌地拖着急促的步子，頤扑着向南奔逃；我望着他的藍色的後影混雜在人叢裏消失。</p>
<p>「年紀輕輕，好好的事情不做，幹這種勾當」，西裝的行人望着他的後影，恨恨的咒駡了一聲，重又趕他的路。</p>
<p>「沒有送他進行，便宜了他」。一個說。</p>
<p>「眞的給他便宜了，不打他個半死」。另一個說。</p>
<p>「哈哈，我看這一頓也很够了」。又是一個說</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>事情就這樣的吿終了；阿林走回隔壁去了。圍着看的八漸漸的四散了，老王重新走上帳台去算帳，小毛……</p>
<p>空氣由嚴肅而漸趨鬆弛，由嘈雜而漸趨寂靜。</p>
<p>我的一顆激盪的心，也漸漸地恢復了平靜；恍惚脫離了一個離奇的夢境。但階沿石上留着殷紅的鮮血，尙未踐踏乾凈，懊喪，痛楚，懺悔，交織在我的心底。</p>
<p>是我的罪惡，那個偷書的人的罪惡，老王的罪惡，那個西裝的行人的罪惡，……，我呆呆的望着天。</p>
<p>天黑沉沉的扳起臉，冷酷地。灰沙在街道上飛舞。</p>
<h3>襪子</h3>
<p>— 佩几</p>
<p>下了英文課後發現有人在我後面笑，回頭一看，兩位雍容華貴的女同學正把目光投射在我的足跟上，原來我穿的是一雙破襪子，後跟都給母親補上了一大塊藍布，走路時脚跟一提就全部露在外面，二塊橢圓形的深藍色是怪令人注意的。</p>
<p>漂亮的姑娘們看了好笑，不知她們可曾料想到這補了的襪子是我親愛的老母親的針綫——這是世界上惟一從小開始最痛愛我的女子的針綫。她們看了好笑，而我俯首向脚下一瞧，却向肚裏呑下了二顆感激的熟淚，心中迴盪起一股暖意，我絲毫不覺得難受。只感到安慰與鼓勵；我一些也不窘，只覺得心頭有一股力量把我的頭抬高了，我關傲，因爲我有母親，這是慈愛的母親的針綫啊！</p>
<p>我的襪子都是幾年前一直穿到現在的舊了的，因爲常穿硬皮鞋，母　襪子的後跟都因摩擦而生了大圓洞。新襪子沒有錢添置，三十多元一雙的新襪子像紙糊的一樣不中用，不消二星期就會破裂生洞。生了洞皮肉露在外面像一對鴨蛋還在其次，皮膚被皮鞋麼擦破了却是受不了，因此又苦了母親，體貼周到的慈母心是可歌頌可膜拜的啊：我沒有向她嚕囌過半句話，十幾雙的舊襪子都被她從衣箱內漏了出來，每個破洞都被她縫補了。</p>
<p>霜風冷冽的冬晚每常我做　功課登床安息時爸的鼾聲己從母親房中憂起，而母親床頭的五支光的檯燈還是沒神地照耀着，她坐在床上補我的破襪或是　弟弟織羊毛衣。破布，破襪，剪刀，長針，短針，羊毛綫等雜亂堆滿了一床，看起來令人怪不舒服，但母親總很安問淑靜地一針針地挑，一塊塊地補，慢慢地織。她總戴上了一副老花眼鏡，閉緊了嘴唇在那事默默地工作，彙黃的燈光洒在她臉上，額上顯出滿是　　的凸凹的皺紋，我每次走進了她的房門，她總垂頭不注意到我，好像全付精力都集中在針錢上，直到我近靠了她，她才微笑對我說：「快去睡吧：時候不早了。」而我總惘然不知該對母親說些什麼。</p>
<p>白天母親爲了繁瑣的家事忙得沒有片刻的閒暇，只有在深夜在安睡之前才能抽出些時間做縫　的工作，但晚上的時間似乎還是不够，大淸早天未亮　得披衣在床上縫上幾針，時間在母親眼中是比無論什麽都　貴。</p>
<p>緊張的工作可以使人精神煥發，但也可使人困頓生病，想到母親我總暗中爲她的健康祝福，二個月以前她因操勞過度眼睛曾經患病一月，淌了許多淚水，受了許多苦痛、醫生勸她要多多休養，多吃些滋補的東西，但母親那肯聽醫生的話。</p>
<p>有錢什麼事都　得了，有錢人買幾十雙五顏六色的新襪十是輕而易舉的小事情，如今沒有錢買新的，由親愛的老母親把舊的一雙雙補了穿，這是多麼費力的時情，而况她是用昏糊的老花眼每天在　光熹　中或在窗外柝聲敲過的燈下終補，做兒子的活了二十多歲還得依　一對頭髮花白的窮父母生活，一切怎會不感激呢！大學中　生　查的少爺小加們那能瞭解我呵！</p>
<h3>奴隸之泣</h3>

<h3>前進</h3>
<p>— 蔡炎炎</p>
<p>雖然，今天我失散在遼遠的一角，</p>
<p>聰死的嘆　吹拂着我的脚跟，</p>
<p>却並沒有向絕望的悲哀招過手。</p>
<p>每每在舌痛的黑影來侵襲我精神的時候，</p>
<p>總還唱起舊日的慷慨短歌，</p>
<p>汲取些勇氣，汲取些力量，</p>
<p>要再向前，再向前！走一步是二步……</p>
<h3>典當裏的春天</h3>
<p>— 吳濤</p>
<p>如果沒有日歷的啓示，典富裏的人也許會永遠覺不到春的隆臨。</p>
<p>瞧！那高邃的團牆，　　上森嚴的鐵柵，簡直像一所牢獄。而那裏面的人——尤其是一羣學徒，便成了無期徒刑的囚犯；因爲典業制度規定學徒是不能隨意走出典門一步的。除了新年的幾天假期，他們便始終被囚在古　的典裏，得不到絲毫陽光，聞不到些　新鮮空氣。他們心目中的整個世界，也祇是這麼一個小小的典屋。唉！這規律是殘忍的，封建的，把學徒們的生活整個地染上一片灰色；把他們的靑春無情地予以摧殘，予以埋沒。而且，學徒根本沒有滿師期限，升得慢的，直至三四十歲也還是一個學徒。</p>
<p>而我，正是這封建殘毒　制下被幽禁的一個！一個學徒。我明白，若要我的生命活得稍有意義的話，非得對這封建的惡魔反抗不可，决不能馴順地再去做它的犧牲。於是，一方面由於求智慾的衝動，一方面則是想和外而廣大的世界多多接觸，我便聯合了比我年長的三個同情我的師兄，向那古板嚴矜的年老經理發出了破天荒的要求：</p>
<p>「先生！我們自問對一切學識經騐都極膚淺。在這日趨複雜的社會中工作，實有諸多不便。所以，現在我們謹向先生提出一個冒昧的要求：請尤許我們早晨或晚間的業餘時間，在附近補習學校讀些書……」</p>
<p>未等說完，他已暴怒得像一頭狂獅般　起脚來，高聲駡着：</p>
<p>「你們這些瘋子！竟會異想天開要到學校去讀書。要知道，你們做了學徒，便得專心爲店裏忠誠服務。豈可再到外面去讀書胡鬧。哈哈哈哈！你們眞是瘋了，瘋了！</p>
<p>一股怨憤，一股疑　，充塞於我們各自的心頭。他這樣連駡我們「瘋了」。難道我們做了賊嗎？犯了罪嗎？發了狂嗎？</p>
<p>「你們眞大膽，價是想入非非！」吸了一口管烟，他又這麼咕矓幾句」。接着，他又像法官究詰盜犯般厲聲問道：「是誰發起的」，</p>
<p>「是我！」我立刻吼了起出，聲書特別粗壯。</p>
<p>「嚀，是你，看不出你人倒小，膽子可眞不小，你耍讀書，儘可回到你老家去。我這店裏，可不容你如此自由。」老頭兒一面握着拳頭敲桌，一面不停地對喔怒叱。</p>
<p>他這種毫無理由的責駡，我實在有些受不了，我想反抗，想把他那固執的頭腦予以澈底的　擊與　刺。可是想起了來店時母親對我的叮囑「孩兒呀！你必須謹愼作事，聽人講話，千萬別使媽傷心呢！」我的勇氣便完全變成了戰慄與彷徨。非但不敢對他項嘴，速看他一下的勇氣也沒有。臉上紅得發燒，只是呆呆地釘望着牆角。</p>
<p>過了一刻，他忽然揮手呌我們出去，於是，我使像得了赦的囚犯，急忙臥室。</p>
<p>從此，我們這一羣老學徒便愈形懦弱。消極的氣氛充沛於每人的言表　志之間：因爲我們已覺悟我們的生命將永遠操縱於這位頑固而專制的老人之魔掌。我們也會想奮鬥，也想另創我們新的樂園，但是，天呀！憑我們這些在紆緩而刻板的典當業務訓練之下的技能，社會上何處是我們的噉飯之地？何處能容我們創造新的榮　？所以，無論我們積極也好，消極也好，生活總是那樣灰諧，沒有絲毫色彩。</p>
<p>一九四四年的　看又姍姍到來，她賜給這世界，這人類許多慰藉與美麗。可是我們却辜負她了。那溫暖的春陽，街道上的春色，天自然的春景：都只是我們腦中的憧憬之物，誰說「春天是我們的」！</p>
<p>在碌碌的征途上，</p>
<p>偶爾歇息下來的時候，</p>
<p>你也曾惦想過舊日的燈光，</p>
<p>牛背的壯曲，</p>
<p>輕舟中的笑聲：</p>
<p>也許，這些零碎的記憶在雄健的畫面上消失，</p>
<p>爲了正義，爲了生存，</p>
<p>只知在廣漠的原野里前進——</p>
<p>不耍歇一歇脚步，</p>
<p>甩盡了生平的精力而猛進，</p>
<p>看到了光明的火炬，</p>
<p>才是你眞正生存的象徵。</p>
<p>那邊有雲端里的天堂，</p>
<p>有山峯上的樂宴，</p>
<p>有靑年羣的高歌，</p>
<p>有自由者的歡笑，</p>
<p>使你更年輕，更維健，</p>
<p>在遼遠的天國，</p>
<p>願國家的健兒珍重！</p>
<p>啊！我己更加緊了脚步向前</p>
<p>同樣地與你追取光明的前哨。</p>
<h3>早起</h3>
<p>— 旭齋</p>
<p>幽人早起趁晴天，一綫晨曦破曉烟，隱約山　吞宿　，漪漣祿浦吸流泉。月鈞漸減如環願，風剌能消趨熱緣，出處倘關家國計，雞鳴猛着祖生鞭。</p>

<h3>體育　被選球員不應臨陣脫逃</h3>
<p>——觀昨日中葡戰有感——</p>
<p>昨日上午十時半，在逸圍有一塲精彩足球賽，中華隊對葡萄牙，爲足聯會主辦之一幕慈善賽。觀衆以震於兩隊盛名，以及報上公佈陣容之堅張，故相率來歸。滿坑滿谷，盛况空前。不料中華隊所選隊員二十一人，而僅到十一人，又以一將受傷，始終以十人應戰，不免慘敗，不禁有感焉。</p>
<p>臨陣缺席精神不佳</p>
<p>中華隊所缺席之隊員爲李天生，蔡聲淼，高保正，費春華，鄭英權，劉顯漢，瞿永福，莊友仁，梁樹棠，吳祺祥等十人，其中莊梁二人，據賈幼艮語記者：均因臨時有務，不克分身。其餘八位健將，爲同隸一隊之球員。記者目睹，大部份均到塲，竊竊私語，似爲有組織之缺席，或則有其苦衷，然我人總覺其精神爲不足取也。夫球員之賽球最主要者爲精神，其次爲球藝表演，勝負居於兩者之後。此次缺席之隊員，均爲上等好手，亦爲球迷矚目所殷望者。臨陣而不戰，非特精神之惡劣，永存我人腦際，抑且何以對萬千球迷，遠道而來，而受盡失望也。況此戰又爲代表中華隊，爭光雪恥，應知其重大性存在。以第一流之選手，而有此種表現，竊以爲實屬大誤。現在，事已過去，我人站在第三者立塲上，甚希有則改之，懸崖勒馬，則不失英雄本色也。臨穎禱盼！</p>
<p>所於出席之球員，以寡敵衆，能奮勇到底。最後猶能在絕對敗勢中（三——〇）扳成和局（三——三）其果敢精神，有足多者。惜臨終又失一關，不免慘敗。唯在塲球迷無不認爲滿意，於作戰之球員，在勝負之外，敬佩其精神於無形中也。有感之餘，再簡叙昨戰過程。</p>
<p>戰局開始葡隊逞威</p>
<p>葡隊先攻，華隊連絡未臻純熟，未及十分鐘，即爲V蘇若於亂軍中過射中的。中華正擬反攻，不料中衛綫上劉祖儒受傷離塲，巷補乏人，乃三十人應戰，士氣一挫。一時振作不起，內部變成多事之秋，敵將逞威，中華僅取招架之勢。在二十分鐘之際，終爲敵中鋒法凡美纏過林根舉足送進，二對〇。中華乃急以郁黎明調任中衛，以厚後方，注力於守中取攻。無奈敵氣正熾，在三十八分時，又爲V蘇若被我門將，連失三球。健兒火從中氣，韓籠海賈幼良奮勇，連袂進攻。不料天不助我，幼良兩失必中之球，均以過於謹愼，以致軟弱無力，爲門將救出，可惜之至。上半時，即以三對〇結束。</p>
<p>中華反攻盛極一時</p>
<p>下半時中葡隊陣容大加更動，以車輪戰術。我隊仍以上半時十人應戰。開始後，我方將十乘對方陣脚未定，大肆攻擊，敵隊禁衛大鬆，祗見我方前鋒四騎士球如珠發，聲勢之壯，無以訶言。誰信敵隊門將，素爲庸俗不足道哉！但斯時有球必救，救必有靈，殆有神助，則非人力所能挽救及者。觀衆無不頓足嘆惜，而認爲該守門實意外之演出。然衆志成城，天不負人，韓龍海屢攻不入之頹氣中，單騎直入，球中木柱彈入。紀錄一開，健兒精神煥發，李垚左路與兵，帶球切中，正落在門口。對方後衛馬山兒與我隊孫錦順同時躍起，球洛在馬山兒身上碰進，演成倒戈請客。我方連得二球，志在反敗爲和，前呼後應，勇不可當，不旋踵，韓龍海冠絕一時，中路突進，雙脚飛處，應聲人網，美麗絕倫。於是球　無不歡呼震耳。不料時離終塲僅十分鐘左右，歡聲尙留耳畔，林根弄巧成拙，爲勃拉達射進，不幸之至。乃終以三對四慘遭敗績矣。</p>
<p>評論兩隊各個球藝</p>
<p>論兩隊作戰，我隊雖十人臨陣，戰來確有令人敬佩之點，攻優於守。唯上半時先半段中，似見鬆懈耳。韓龍海尤爲最特色之人物，非以獨得二球爲可貴。觀乎其滿堪飛奔，毫無倦容，値得嘉許也。賈幼良功過相抵，勇則有餘，不進二必中之球，應負失着。　福樍較前兩戰遜色，要亦搭配不佳。張林根最賣力，與法凡笑窮拚，厥功殊偉。門將張邦倫殊見平平，僅救出險球一次，餘均爲攻進，張君應多加訓練。</p>
<p>葡隊昨未見如何精神過人，特以其球運亭通，V蘇若可爲最有爲至前鋒。奔馳搶球，均見頭頭是道。其餘馬山　考司坦維克泰，俱有老將身手。門將A羅柴遠有　　狀態演出，要亦幸運關係，如以後能保特此成績，不愧爲大材也。</p>
<p>總之，中華隊昨敗，非戰之罪，乃球運耳。（潔）</p>
<h3>再論「籃球裁判難」</h3>
<p>— 梅必賢</p>
<p>上期本刊登載拙作　籃球裁判難」後，有籃球前輩謝益欽君邀余談話。（謝君任職鹽業銀行，對於籃球極有研究，爲綠隊女子籃球隊領隊兼指導）。言籃球裁判，尙有數點應予注意，詞極中肯，確有見地，值此西靑行將結束，中靑開幕在即，爰再不揣謭陋，錄述於下。並酌加鄙見，作爲前文之補充，極願籃球裁判予以採納。</p>
<p>（一）服裝必須顯著</p>
<p>籃球比賽動作極快，裁判服裝如與球員相似，易滋誤會。吾人每見在戰情緊張中，因服裝類似，球員不暇細辨，輙有誤認裁判爲同隊隊員，而將球傳與裁判之事發生。故裁判服裝最好規定一律式樣，並以顏色顯著者爲尙。</p>
<p>（二）精神務求飽滿</p>
<p>裁判如能精神抖擻，氣概十足，必可使比賽興趣因之提高，生色不少。反之，若無精打彩，敷衍了事（西靑凱齊密洛天，始終如此）乃使緊凑精彩之球賽，而變成鬆弛之局面。故裁判如已知明日有職務，今晚宜早安睡，以養精力，庶幾有成。</p>
<p>（三）口齒簡單清晰</p>
<p>除遇有西隊比賽外，華隊與華隊角逐（西靑或爲環境使然，辦事員均係西人）如在中靑，則彼此均係中國同胞，應用簡單之國語，英語大可不必。（據聞前我國參加柏林世界運動會時，選手間交談，常操英語。德人聞之，大爲驚異。雖屬小節，値得注意，特此附筆）。發音宜沉重淸晰，不可太快。最要者，切忌西語與華語並用，因難免不生語病，如言「Number第幾句號犯規」等等，重複之點，不倫不類，貽笑大方，何可取之有？</p>
<p>（四）判斷不可猶豫</p>
<p>笛聲一嗚，判斷隨之宣佈，令出必行，决不可稍事猶豫，而使球員乘此時間有所表示。蓋判斷旣定即有訛誤，亦决無更改之理。所以維裁判尊嚴之道也。</p>
<p>（五）須具相當球藝</p>
<p>對於接球傳球之基本動作，至少須略窺門徑，否則接球失手，傳球無目標，徒費時間，而此項所費時間，計時員自未能注意及此，此在重大比賽中，千鈞一髪，大有關梁也。</p>
<p>此外加熟讀規則，俾能應答如流，體格强健，不　奔馳，亦爲籃球裁判員之必要條件，能如斯；則不失爲一典型裁判，轉，中靑籃球聯賽將開幕。吾人除願如西靑毆打裁判之事决不發生外，亦盼委員會諸公，採納我言，並有以指正！</p>

<p>B: Recently, the European war is indeed developing subtly. On one hand, the Soviet Union's winter offensive is about to reach its climax, and its future is worth noting. On the other hand, the atmosphere of a so-called "second front" is becoming increasingly intense, and the European situation is rapidly moving towards a decisive battle stage. Therefore, what you call "dull" may just be the calm before the storm!</p>
<p>A: Yesterday, I saw in the February 4th Asahi Shimbun that the Soviet army on the Eastern Front is said to be focusing its offensive on the central, southern, and northern sectors, advancing fiercely on the weaker parts of the German defenses. The German side is currently not optimistic. However, if we say that the British and Americans taking this opportunity to advance their offensive in Western Europe would threaten Germany's war capabilities, I'm afraid that is an exaggerated illusion, right?</p>
<p>B: Yes. Therefore, when we observe the war situation, we must also pay attention to the subtle political relationships and trends between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union behind the war. From the Soviet perspective, they are urging Britain and America to open a second front, but on the other hand, they still adhere to a policy of self-determination, making every effort to advance in order to create a certain fait accompli before the formation of the second front, so as to smoothly implement their world policy towards Europe. Therefore, it has coordinated with the winter offensive and actively launched its political offensive against Europe.</p>
<p>A: No wonder the newspapers recently reported extensively on the Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet meeting, which decided to grant the republics participating in the Soviet Union independent rights in foreign affairs and military affairs. It turns out that the Soviet Union hopes to use this new political strategy to deal with Britain and America!</p>
<p>B: This decision by the Soviet Union naturally startled Britain, America, and even the world. Allowing each country participating in the federation to build its own national defense forces and handle its own foreign affairs will have a significant impact on some small European countries, especially regarding the Polish-Soviet dispute and other issues, putting Britain and America in a very awkward position!</p>
<p>A: Naturally, the main target of this new move by the Soviet Union is the small European countries, attempting to incite rebellion and facilitate the advancement of its offensive. However, this political offensive will not have much effect on Germany. The silence of various Eastern European and Balkan countries in recent days shows that the success lies elsewhere. However, strangely, there are rumors circulating about Finland!</p>
<p>B: The reason is also very simple. The United States has never let go of Finland. Now that the Soviet Union has launched its political offensive, Britain and America, feeling threatened, have no choice but to play along and put some effort into the Finnish issue! However, rumors are most afraid of facts, and the facts will answer within a few days, so there may be no need to be surprised.</p>
<p>A: That's right, yesterday the newspaper already had news of Germany refuting all rumors of peace talks. I think that on the eve of this decisive battle in Europe, with these political and diplomatic maneuvers between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, I cannot help but doubt what you just said about the European situation rapidly moving towards a decisive battle!</p>
<p>B: This is because you overestimate the internal contradictions within the anti-Axis powers. In reality, it is a fact that the political relations between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union will also encounter limitations as the war situation develops. This is not only a matter of the power relations between the three countries, but also a matter of the opposition of political ideologies. The declarations by people like Wendell Willkie that the Soviet Union's westward expansion threatens Britain and America refer to this. However, today, Britain and America have no way to escape the tragic fate of their situation, and they have the painful necessity to quickly launch an offensive in Western Europe. The saying "taking a desperate gamble" is not wrong at all!</p>
<p>A: However, Germany is smoothly implementing its strategy of "maintaining war capabilities." Just watch, and it will give the adventurers who attack Western Europe a suitable response.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles in Arakan: Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Bomb Enemy Positions, Three Military Facilities Set Ablaze</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese army base in Burma on the 13th: The fighting on the Arakan front has been exceptionally fierce recently. Japanese army aircraft bombed an enemy base on the night of the 11th, setting fire to three enemy military facilities. At the same time, enemy transport ships on the Naf River were also hit and caught fire. Furthermore, other aircraft squadrons also launched a large-scale attack on enemy positions east of Maungdaw, inflicting heavy damage on the retreating enemy and setting two places on fire.

If an American plane fights against a Japanese plane, it will definitely be shot down. In the Battle of Guadalcanal, the American air force had no power to fight Japanese fighter planes alone. Japanese fighter planes have extremely high maneuverability, so they are superior to the fighter planes of any anti-Axis army. If American fighter planes want to fight against such excellent fighter planes, they have no other way but to fight with a ratio of two to one.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Attack Jiujiang</p>

<h3>The Defense and Offense of European Fortresses (6)</h3>
<p>Asahi Shimbun Roundtable Discussion</p>
<p>Asahi Shimbun: The Balkan operation will sooner or later correspond to the South Italian front and the second front, and will be implemented soon. From which direction will the British, American, and Soviet forces come to attack?</p>
<p>Special Correspondent Sasamoto (Berlin): Since November of last year, the British and Americans have continuously bombed the Thessaloniki area and Sofia. For a week from January 15th, there was continuous bombing of Dalmatia, exposing the British and American coveting of the Balkans. However, after the British and American forces lost their island bases in Leos and Samos to the German army in October and November of last year, the operation in this area is very difficult. Therefore, the only relatively easy area for the British and American Balkan operation is the Dalmatian coast. The possibility of landing in this area, following the British and American advance northward in Italy, is gradually increasing.</p>
<p>The German army has long prepared countermeasures against the enemy's attempts on Dalmatia. They quickly dealt with the crisis when Badoglio withdrew, occupied the island of Corfu and other islands defended by Badoglio's troops, and maintained strict vigilance.</p>
<p>Balkan Trends</p>
<p>Asahi Shimbun: The anti-Axis powers are using strategic warfare to detach the Balkan countries from the Axis, targeting Turkey, Bulgaria, Hungary, etc. So, will Turkey stand on the side of the anti-Axis powers and participate in the war?</p>
<p>Sasamoto: Turkey's objective situation today does not allow it to decide its actions solely by its own will. Turkey itself is very clear about this.</p>
<p>So, under what circumstances will Turkey participate in the war? First, even if the British and American Balkan operation does not directly require Turkey's military cooperation, it will inevitably demand the use of Turkish sea and air force bases and the recognition of the passage of troops. In that case, the German army will immediately counterattack. Second, while the British and Americans are landing in Dalmatia, which has no connection with Turkey, to attack the Balkans, the Red Army will invade Romania and further south, plunging the Balkans into chaos. In this case, Turkey, in the name of maintaining order in the Balkans, will cooperate with the British and American forces in taking action.</p>
<p>However, the German army is standing by in the Balkans, and a direct conflict with the German army is very dangerous for Turkey. Turkey is also well aware of this. When considering future issues with the Soviet Union, Britain and America do not want the main force of the Turkish army to be destroyed by the German army. Therefore, the second scenario is a strong reason for participation in the war.</p>
<p>Asahi Shimbun: What are the trends in Bulgaria?</p>
<p>Umeda: Bulgaria aims to recover lost territory and build a Greater Bulgaria. However, there is a high level of pro-Soviet sentiment in the country, and it is the only Slavic country that is not at war with the Soviet Union. However, caught between Germany and the Soviet Union, Bulgaria is also subject to British and American terror bombings. The spiritual suffering that the country has endured in the past six months is truly worthy of sympathy.</p>
<p>Asahi Shimbun: What is the state of Hungary?</p>
<p>Umeda: Hungary, whether from an economic or operational point of view, is the gateway for Germany to enter and exit the Balkans. The two countries are not only united by previous traditions, but are also bound by a fate of inevitable cooperation. After the Italian coup, Hungary cannot but make considerable efforts to seek political stability. However, the power of the opposition to the government is also quite strong, supported by 1.5 million minority Jewish people, and the government has not yet announced basic laws on suppressing Jewish people. Another difficulty is the territorial dispute with Romania. These are all difficult problems to solve in the future. The day will soon come when these many Balkan countries are firmly united by the Danube River and become the cornerstone of a new European order.

<h3>Party Workers Training Corps, First Term Begins</h3>

<h3>Agricultural Production Increase Association Formulates Guidelines for Promoting Production Increase</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - Since its establishment, the Executive Yuan's Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee has been actively formulating regulations and policies to promote production increase, in order to ensure smooth progress under unified guidance and promotion. It is learned that the committee has now formulated "Guidelines for Promoting Agricultural Production Increase" as a standard for promoting work. The content of the guidelines is to establish an overall production increase plan, review the agricultural production increase plans of the country and various provinces and cities, concentrate funds to encourage production increase, and simultaneously predetermine 30 counties with good public order and convenient promotion in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, in order to utilize local cooperative branches, production mutual aid societies, township agricultural promotion associations, and other grassroots organizations to jointly promote production increase, and to further enrich the content of various farms as a model for farmers. As for the agricultural production increase targets, they are divided into three categories: first, food crops such as rice and wheat; second, oil crops such as oilseeds and castor beans; and third, fiber crops such as cotton and hemp. In order to enable farmers to spontaneously understand the relationship between agricultural improvement and production increase, the authorities will provide assistance at any time, adjust the purchase prices of various agricultural crops, and carefully consider the smooth allocation of agricultural and daily necessities. Those who excel in production increase will be rewarded, and extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies that exploit farmers will be abolished, so as to ensure that people do their best and land is used to its full potential. Therefore, it can be predicted that after the promulgation and implementation of these guidelines, the two major goals of stabilizing people's livelihood and ensuring military needs will be achieved. In addition, the committee has also formulated a "Schedule for Promoting Urgent Production Increase for This Year" to supervise and urge relevant agencies to implement it according to the schedule in order to achieve success.</p>
<h3>British Military Mission Returns Home, British-Turkish Negotiations Stalled, Turkey Decides on Measures to Defend its Territory</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Ankara: The British military mission and the Turkish General Staff held secret military talks for a month. These talks have stalled for some reason. The British military mission, led by Generals Lindset and Penley Wang, has departed from Ankara on its way back to England. The reason for the stalling of the talks seems to be the unsatisfactory resolution of the issue of Britain supplying military supplies to Turkey. According to well-informed sources, Britain wanted to supply the Turkish army with captured goods, but the Turkish side felt that this was a violation of the announcements made at the Adana and Cairo talks. He was going to return to England to take office, but each time the military talks between the two countries were postponed until blood was spilled. Now the army has decided to depart for London on the night of the 14th to take office. At the same time, Turkey is stationed in Iran.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to Ankara: In order to defend its territory, the Turkish government has recently submitted a bill to parliament granting the Turkish army the right to requisition land and buildings when necessary.</p>

<h3>Japan Conducts Periodic Census of the National Population</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government has decided to start investigating the population of the country this year on the 23rd of this month.

The Cabinet Statistics Bureau will, within ten days from the 12th to the 20th, send investigators to distribute written notifications to each household to investigate the number of households in the survey area. It is reported that the survey time is 0:00 AM on February 20th.

<h3>Military Conference Held at the White House</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a report by Reuter's news agency from Washington, President Roosevelt, after meeting with new reporters yesterday, discussed the Netuno battle situation with the army and navy staff.

Military experts in Washington said that Roosevelt's meeting with senior generals shows that the difficulties encountered by the anti-Axis forces in Italy should not be underestimated.</p>
<h3>Tank Battle on the Upper Reaches of the Bug River, Street Fights for Jia are in Progress</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th - The Soviet 1st and 2nd Armies on the Ukrainian front, in cooperation, launched an encirclement of the German army west of Cherkassy, which has become increasingly fierce as of the 12th. The Soviet army then launched a fierce attack on Kolsny, a stronghold west of Cherkassy, from the directions of Dakanci and Miropoliere. According to a communique from the Soviet Information Bureau on the night of the 12th, the German army constantly sent large armies of tanks and infantry from the east of Hesikov to launch fierce counterattacks. Furthermore, approximately 1,500 German and Soviet tanks engaged in an unprecedented decisive battle on the upper reaches of the Bug River on the 12th. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the Manstein army is constantly sending reinforcements, posing a great threat to the rear of the Soviet army attacking Kolsny, and the outcome of the battle is difficult to predict. Furthermore, on the northern front, after securing the Leningrad, Badiejka, and Moscow railways in the Luga area, the Soviet army is planning to advance westward to recapture Luga, but the German army has stopped the Soviet army's advance in the eastern part of Luga, and fierce street fights are currently in progress.</p>
<h3>Japan's National Savings Amount Will Definitely Be Successfully Completed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Japan's national savings target for this year was decided at the cabinet meeting on the 12th to be 36 billion yuan, and was formally announced by the Information Bureau in the afternoon. Regarding increasing national savings, Finance Minister Kaya advocated very actively. He explained at this parliament meeting that, based on the state's financial position, 28.5 billion yuan of public debt funds this year, 6 billion yuan of expanded production funds, and approximately 7 billion yuan of funds released for the rectification of enterprises, totaling 35 billion yuan, must be planned from the national total income of 60 billion yuan this year. Later, he also advocated in parliament that, given the current purchasing power, private funds from the people should be actively absorbed. In addition to the 35 billion yuan, 1 billion yuan of ordinary private funds absorption was added, and it was decided that the national savings target for this year would be 36 billion yuan. This figure is 9 billion yuan more than last year's 27 billion yuan. Last year's target was successfully completed. This year is the decisive year, and the Japanese people across the country have always been known for their sincerity in contributing to the country. It is expected that this year's savings target will definitely be completed.</p>

<h3>Tram Company Adjusts Various Implementation Measures</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented Separately Starting on the 16th</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The Shanghai Tram Company, in order to unify fares, eliminate ticket scalping, and improve the routes, has made separate adjustments to the above points, and has scheduled them to be implemented from the 16th of this month. The company's implementation methods are specially recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Unified Fares</p>
<p>Starting on the 16th of this month, the company will completely abolish the original zone-based fare system for all tram lines, both rail and trackless, in the city, and implement a uniform fare system regardless of distance for each line. The rates are: First class, 1 yuan (military ticket 5 jiao); Third class, 5 jiao (military ticket 3 jiao). As for monthly and quarterly tickets, they are divided into two types: full line (universal for all lines) and one line (designated for one line). The prices are as follows: (First Class) Adults, full line, 160 yuan per month, 385 yuan for three months; one line, 80 yuan per month, 195 yuan for three months. Children, full line, 80 yuan per month; one line, 40 yuan per month. (Third Class) Adults, full line, 80 yuan per month; one line, 40 yuan per month. If companies, businesses, or organizations have more than 20 people, the company can give preferential discounts after requesting them. In addition, the monthly and quarterly tickets for this (February) can still be used as before without the need to increase the price.</p>
<p>Adjusted Routes</p>
<p>The company has separately adjusted all the original routes and has set new names for identification.

(Route 21) Zhaofeng Garden - Jing'an Temple. (Also learned) In order to prevent ticket sellers from cheating, the company has also changed the way passengers use tickets as follows: A. Passengers must hand over their tickets to the ticket seller or ticket inspector when getting off the bus. B. At stops with ticket sellers, passengers must purchase tickets before boarding. C. Passengers using monthly student tickets must show the ticket to the ticket seller or ticket inspector when boarding and alighting.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Peddling Stamp Tax Tickets</h3>
<p>Tax Bureau Asks Police Bureau for Assistance</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax Bureau recently received a secret report stating that someone outside is falsely using the name to peddle stamp tax tickets to residents and shops. This is a violation of tax policy and will inevitably affect the entire tax revenue. Therefore, yesterday, the bureau separately sent letters to the various police bureaus in the city, instructing their respective branches to provide assistance within their respective jurisdictions. Conduct investigations and prohibitions at any time, and if discovered, immediately detain and severely punish them to achieve organization and prevent abuses.</p>
<p>News was Released Yesterday at 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Sports: Second Act of Charity Soccer Match: China Loses to Portugal</h3>
<p>Score: 4 to 3</p>
<p>The second act of the charity soccer match organized by the Shanghai Football Association, China vs. Portugal, was held at the Yiyuan Stadium at 10:30 AM yesterday. The referee was Xuan Gu Zhengzhu. Portugal's ability to defeat China 4-3 was by no means a fluke. China's defeat by 4-3 was also not unjust. Although China tried to save the decline, it was helpless against the crowd (China only played with ten people). Portuguese goalkeeper A. Luo Chailiao was agile and rescued many dangerous balls, completely different from the past. The team's victory was entirely due to Luo Chailiao's功. V. Su Ruo commanded the three armies and was very organized. The front five forwards were in control of the whole field. Ma Xiaor was worthy of the veteran style, and his positioning and blocking were excellent. Da Chong Fa Fanxiao was also not weak, and the remaining players were all above average. During the opening ten minutes, Liu Zubei of the Chinese team was injured and left the field, so only ten players were playing. The Chinese team was based on the entire Donghua team, supplemented by Maisen from the three provinces. The Liaison generals did not come to the battle. In terms of personal technique, Han Longhai was the best, playing both as a general and a minister. Tan Fu did not show any brilliance. Mai Youliang, although brave, missed two excellent opportunities, 功败垂成. Zhang Banglun was disappointing. Banglun should be responsible for half of China's defeat. In the first half, Old Portugal led 3-1. In the second half, China pulled back two goals. As for the front field, Portugal scored another goal, resulting in a 4-1 defeat for China.</p>

<h3>Economic Circle: North China and Su Huai Trade Merchants Association Established</h3>
<p>Promoting the Exchange of Goods Between North and South</p>
<p>There is a large annual volume of import and export trade between this city and North China and Su Huai, and it is of great importance to the exchange of goods between the North and South. With the guidance of relevant authorities, the two trade associations of North China and Su Huai import and export merchants were established in Shanghai yesterday (13th). The inaugural meetings were held at the Huzhe Society on Guizhou Road. Officials from various agencies who attended included Director Yu Langxi of the Business Statistics Association, Section Chief Chen Jun, Director Zhang Zhiming of the Economic Bureau, and Zhou Hongsheng of the 士 Business Association. The Su Huai Import and Export Trade Association was established at 10:00 AM. The presidium included Jin Zhigong, Zhao Jixin, and Chen Zhusheng. They reported on the preparations and passed the draft articles of association. The best candidates for supervisors were elected. The North China Import and Export Trade Association was established at 1:00 PM. The presidium included Zhang Jingli, Jin Zhigong, Meng Tai, Wang Dong Sheng, etc. After the entire organization was formed, they reported and elected the supervisors, which took two hours.</p>
<p>The list of directors and supervisors of the two associations is as follows: (List of Directors and Supervisors of the Shanghai Special Municipality Su Huai Import and Export Trade Association) (Chairman) Jin Zhigong (Directors) Zhao Jixin, Wang Xinkui, Zhu Zhenchang, Feng Guanqiu, Chen Zhusheng, Sun Degong, He Weishi, Wang Boyong, Cao Xu, Meng Liping, Chen Bingfang, Chen Jianhua, Ji Baiqiang, Qian Zhu (Alternate Directors) Sun Kangrong, Guo Bingquan, Lu Xinfu (Supervisors) Shen Dacheng, Shen Maozhi, Wu Libin.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Silver and Money Industry Request for Extension of Capital Increase Deadline</h3>
<p>Deadline Extended to the End of March This Year</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the financial institutions of the silver and money industry, the Ministry of Finance stipulated that all banks and money houses that do not engage in savings and trust business must increase their total capital to 6 million yuan and must first collect one-half of the amount. All banks and money houses have complied with the order. When submitting the report to the Ministry of Finance to change the registration after the capital increase is completed, the Silver and Money Industry Association will verify the amount of the capital increase and provide a certificate. Because the deadline for the capital increase was originally set at the end of December of the 32nd year, and some banks and money houses used the surplus distributed to shareholders at the end of the year for capital increase, the deadline was inevitably too short to complete the process. Therefore, the two associations jointly submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance to request an appropriate extension of the capital increase deadline. The extension was approved to the end of March of the 33rd year. Since the deadline has been extended, it is possible to handle the matter calmly. After all the capital increases have been completed, the organization will be more substantial, and the overall finance will be more stable.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Situation: Black Market of Public Bonds Subsided and the Situation Stabilized</h3>
<p>In the Shanghai financial and industrial market last week, after the start of business after the New Year holiday, the silver and money industry treated loan business with special caution, so the tight monetary conditions did not ease, and transactions could not be carried out. However, those with funds, judging that the market was difficult to activate, were persuaded by general market buyers to speculate. The illegal transactions in the black market of public bonds caused market prices to rise sharply, causing panic and unrest. Fortunately, the Bureau of Economy discovered this and immediately used decisive means to detain the illegal red-chip and bond brokers and issued a severe warning. The black market of both red-chip and bond were completely eliminated. Therefore, the financial situation became more stable. Stock market prices also fell at any time due to the authorities' strict ban on speculative trading and the crackdown on illegal stock listings. The industrial and commercial sectors had sufficient inventory before the end of the Spring Festival, so transactions were small. However, due to various bad rumors, prices continued to rise. The authorities are now paying attention to cracking down on merchants who raise prices without authorization, otherwise, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations Review Membership Qualifications</h3>
<p>In order to fix prices on time, the major commodity trade associations in this city have convened joint meetings of directors and supervisors. They strictly review the qualifications of trade members, and consider the business nature, whether retail or wholesale. They will assess whether the types of goods sold should be included in the association, and whether the articles of association are in conflict. They will also review whether members have complied with the price limits set by the association, and various measures. They will ensure that the member's shops have the goods they need and whether they use standard weights and measures. If a member is found to be in non-compliance with any of the above, they will be ordered to withdraw from the association and stop enjoying various interests.</p>
<h3>Second Savings Campaign Extended by One Week</h3>
<p>The second savings week sponsored by the Central Savings Bank has been decided to be extended for another week from today (14th) to the 19th, so that those who are interested can have the opportunity to participate in the prize-winning savings. It is reported that the banking and money industry associations have issued circulars to their member banks and money houses, requiring them to recognize the amount of fixed-term savings deposits if they have not recognized the amount of fixed-term savings deposits during the savings cycle from January 17th to January 22nd, and they must recognize the full amount within this week.</p>
<h3>Coal Slag Industry Association Plans to Formulate Industry Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Coal Slag Trade Association, in order to seek the welfare of the industry and standardize the market price of coal slag, has been actively formulating "Industry Regulations for Buying and Selling." It was submitted to the competent authorities for filing on the thief's day. Hereafter, all member businesses must follow the draft rules set by the association for transactions and must not outwardly comply but inwardly disobey.</p>

<p>Arabian Sea - Record of a Japanese Submarine's Gallant Fight</p>
<p>In a certain month, the raging waves of the Indian Ocean made the soldiers on board feel greatly distressed. Our objective was to advance westward from the Arabian Sea toward a certain bay and launch an attack. One day, just past noon, the first prey was discovered on the horizon. As expected, we encountered an enemy ship departing from Colombo.</p>
<p>The enemy's air patrols were becoming increasingly intense. A 10,000-ton cargo ship gradually appeared in the periscope. The torpedoes that were fired struck the enemy ship in front of the bridge and at the stern. In an instant, the ship tilted and sank. After a while, the ship regained its balance, and the enemy, sending out distress signals, immediately launched two small wooden boats and began to flee. Our captain decided to carry out a gun battle during the day and ordered preparations for a rapid surface gun battle. Our usual training was fully utilized at this time, and we immediately subjected the enemy ship to intense shelling. The shells hit their mark, and fire broke out from under the bridge, engulfing the ship in black smoke, and it gradually sank into the sea.</p>
<p>Treating Prisoners Favorably: According to the captured captain, the ship was originally a Dutch vessel, but upon the outbreak of the war, it was ordered by the British to transport military supplies, and it was on its way from Colombo to Durban. We gave him a room and a blanket and treated him with the food and drink of an officer, and we treated him with the respect due to a captain.</p>
<p>At night, the lights were turned on, because the ship was near Ceylon Island. Fearing that an enemy flying艇母艦 would be on night patrol, we immediately prepared for a torpedo attack, but upon approaching, we saw that it was an enemy hospital ship, with a snow-white hull displaying a red cross. This was probably escorting wounded British soldiers from the Indian border. The enemy countries of America and Britain had attacked our hospital ships several times, and we were holding great regrets, but the Japanese Navy was fighting for justice, so we silently let it pass, hoping to sink enemy ships another day.</p>
<p>Surfacing During the Day: Breaking through the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, we entered a certain destination. No matter how strict the enemy's air patrols were, in order to achieve great results, the captain decided to surface during the day, so that enemy ships could be quickly discovered in the wide field of vision. The captain then ordered the lookouts to be strictly vigilant in the air, and he guarded the command tower himself. As a result, the morale of the entire ship was greatly boosted. Several times enemy planes were discovered, and the ship quickly submerged.</p>
<p>One day at dusk, a 10,000-ton cargo ship left port. At night, because the air was misty, the visibility suddenly became unclear. The preparation for launching torpedoes was already complete. After the captain looked through the periscope, when approaching the enemy ship, whether the enemy ship had noticed or not, it suddenly changed direction, thus missing a good opportunity, but our ship immediately surfaced to chase. Soon, the front of the enemy ship was hit by shells, and it seemed that the propeller rudder had malfunctioned, and the ship began to circle around. The ship gradually rose, and the propeller became visible.</p>
<p>The captain stared at the periscope, preparing to deliver the final blow. But two enemy planes came in quick succession, interrupting the thought of attacking, deeply submerging into the sea, unable to witness the final sight of the enemy ship. However, since the bow of the enemy ship had sunk into the sea, it would inevitably sink. Later, although we encountered enemy ships twice, we lost the opportunity to attack because of enemy air cover.</p>
<p>Lightning Attack: Once, hearing the shout of the guard, the captain fired out and saw a 10,000-ton cargo ship reflected in it, and upon closer inspection, he knew that it was a specially equipped gunboat disguised as a merchant ship, with one large gun each in the front and rear, and five linked machine guns in the center. If we attacked and failed to sink it, we would be subjected to a fierce counterattack, so the captain's policy of launching an attack was very cautious. The torpedoes also seemed to have a spiritual mind, hitting the bow and center of the ship squarely. In an instant, a huge explosion occurred. Looking at the bow of the ship sinking, the entire ship sank. This was only a matter of a few minutes, a lightning attack that was so fast that one could barely catch one's breath.</p>
<p>Like a ferocious and brave lion, the captain, disregarding personal danger, drove the boat to the entrance of a certain bay. Sure enough, a very large transport ship was discovered, almost as large as a battleship. In the bay, with the sun shining directly, the enemy ship did not expect a Japanese submarine to come here. The deck was covered with tarpaulins, and the cannons were also covered. The torpedoes we fired hit below the bridge, and the enemy ship, fully loaded with heavy oil, immediately caught fire in a few moments, and sank. The heavy oil flowing into the sea also caught fire, and the fierce fire at sea gradually expanded its scope, presenting a tragic scene of a fiery hell. Now our long-range submarine has established brilliant achievements in a certain port. Although the enemy planes on patrol dropped two bombs on us, they did not hit. We quickly and skillfully navigated away, feeling very satisfied in our hearts, and quietly walked on the seabed. (Hong Ren from the January 20 Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Bougainville Island - Record of Six Naval and Air Battles</h3>
<p>Very close to the anniversary of the great naval battle of Hawaii, on December 3rd, the Japanese eagles (navy planes) again established glorious battle achievements on the Solomon Sea, sinking three enemy aircraft carriers, one battleship, and one large cruiser. In addition, one large cruiser and one destroyer also seemed to have been sunk, and one battleship was also damaged by bombing. This great achievement is a shining testament to the valiant fighting of the Japanese naval air force defending the South Pacific, following the successive brilliant achievements of the Bougainville Island aerial battle in early November, adding a brilliant page to naval battle history.</p>
<p>The report of the appearance of the enemy's mobile unit was transmitted to the 〇〇 base on that day's clear morning. The enemy was a powerful unit with aircraft carriers and battleships as its main force. Since the fifth Bougainville Island sea battle on November 17th, the seamen, fully prepared, had been paying attention to the enemy's movements. After receiving this report, they believed that the expected fact had appeared and were determined to annihilate the enemy, stroking their iron arms and listening to the news. Once the order was given, the sortie preparations of the sea eagle torpedo squadron were quickly completed. The enemy had already suffered such great damage in the first to fifth Bougainville Island sea battles, but they continued to regroup and challenge the southern defense line. Such a persistent offensive and the successive dispatch of fleets must be severely hit and reduced.</p>
<p>"One plane to take out one ship! Torpedoes must hit! Take them out without fail!"</p>
<p>Before the sortie, the commander of the day, 〇〇 Captain, gave a very short speech to his subordinates, but the awe-inspiring spirit in it conveyed a strong belief. Before long, the time for departure had arrived. The sea eagles spread their silver wings and soared into the sky. The fierce battle situation narrated by the brave sea eagle torpedo squadron warriors who fought to the death in that day's attack, and jointly defeated the enemy aircraft carrier group with friendly forces, is summarized as follows.</p>
<p>Sea Eagles Sortie: The sea eagle torpedo squadron departed from the base at 〇〇 hours 〇〇 minutes, advancing towards the target sea area in continuous succession. Before long, the sunset of the South Sea had sunk below the horizon, and the afterglow of the western sky gradually faded, as dusk slowly descended upon the deep blue sea. In a moment, the dark shadow of 〇〇 Island was seen ahead. The planned battlefield was over there. We carefully scanned the sea, but did not find anything resembling an enemy ship. The planes continued to fly towards the island. Suddenly, the glare of a searchlight shot out from the land, and the barrage of anti-aircraft guns almost simultaneously unfolded beneath our feet, exploding one after another. Several enemy fighters attacked us from the side. We used clouds as cover while continuing to search for enemy ships. Before long, four or five enemy transport ships were found on the sea between the broken clouds. They recklessly opened fire with anti-aircraft guns without considering their own capabilities. We ignored them and continued to advance, gazing at the sea without blinking for a moment. Sure enough, dark ship shadows were soon seen lined up ahead, undoubtedly the enemy fleet. At a glance, there were more than ten ships. Destroyers were deployed around them, cruisers guarded the front and sides, and aircraft carriers were in the center. They stirred up white waves on the dusky sea, sailing northwest. Looking further ahead, ship shadows that seemed to be battleships could be seen. Haha, the enemy we were searching for had finally been found. The time was exactly twilight, a perfect time to launch an attack, 〇〇 minutes after sunset. "All units attack!" The commander's plane issued this order at exactly 〇〇 hours 〇〇 minutes in the afternoon. With so much prey, our formation immediately dispersed, and each plane identified its target and plunged in one after another.</p>
<p>At this time, red flares, like bright red lanterns, hung high above the enemy fleet. They were dropped by the preceding search planes. The commander's plane, leading the remaining sea eagles, rushed towards the enemy ship formation indicated by this fireball. At this time, the enemy ships, already aware of our attack, simultaneously unleashed a barrage of anti-aircraft fire. To avoid our fierce attack, anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns were used, not to mention even the main guns were fired wildly.</p>
<p>Once the commander's plane identified a target and prepared to launch a torpedo, it sought accuracy in its attack, rushing through the scarlet screen of iron and fire, boldly speeding through the center of the enemy fleet, turning the plane, and again掠敵艦 in the opposite direction. However, Commander 〇〇 Captain believed that the angle was still insufficient, so he rotated the nose again, corrected the course, and plunged in at the best position. Unexpectedly, another enemy ship suddenly appeared in front, and after being obstructed by it, he had to correct the direction again. This time, he flew out in front of the enemy ship formation, attacked from the left side between the giant ships, and released the torpedo that was guaranteed to kill. The enemy ship concentrated even more intense fire on this rapidly turning commander's plane.</p>
<p>All Units Attack</p>
<p>At this time, the dusk on the sea was thick, and the sky was almost completely covered by clouds. A crescent moon like a comb occasionally peeked out from between the clouds, casting a faint light on the sea. The planes of the torpedo squadron, following in the footsteps of the commander's plane, each attacked their targets with their lives and carried out daring attacks. The enemy ship's defensive fire became more and more intense, with flames constantly erupting from the sea, surrounding the aircraft carriers in the center, drawing a fiery wheel on the sea. In this way, about 〇〇 minutes after the order to attack all units, one enemy ship had been hit by a torpedo, and its giant body soon disappeared from the dimly lit sea. Then, an aircraft carrier was also hit by a torpedo that was guaranteed to kill, and a column of fire shot up into the sky from the center of the ship. Its deck was turned into a sea of fire, and then the entire ship was engulfed in flames. A moment later, the hull of another aircraft carrier was hit by a torpedo, and with a loud bang, a large fire immediately broke out. Bright red flames soared into the air. At the same time, two friendly planes were unfortunately hit by enemy bullets in this fierce battle, turned into fireballs, and plunged into the enemy陣營, completing a heroic suicide attack. The commander's plane, having completed the torpedo launch, was hit in twenty places by bullets, and the gasoline tank was also broken, with gasoline dripping out, but it still leisurely soared above the battlefield, until it had verified the above results, before leaving the battlefield illuminated by the raging fires of the enemy aircraft carriers and returning to base in triumph.</p>
<p>The roaring sea eagle spirit of the commander who corrected his attack four times in the enemy's fierce fire was shared by all the team members. One of the torpedo機, determined to take out the enemy aircraft carrier, rushed forward fiercely, searching for an aircraft carrier, regardless of what the opponent was doing. In the midst of dodging the enemy's fierce防砲火 and searching for an aircraft carrier, the scheduled attack time had passed, but in order to ensure that the released torpedo would hit its target, it had to be extremely cautious. The sea was already very dark, and even the ship shadows were not very clear. This plane still circled left and right, continuing to search for an ideal target. Later, the enemy ship in front was hit by a巨彈, and suddenly burst out with raging flames. Flying closer to observe carefully, it turned out to be an aircraft carrier. Behind this burning aircraft carrier, there was another aircraft carrier, so it identified its target, launched an attack, released a torpedo that was guaranteed to hit, dodged the intense defensive fire, and quickly turned back.</p>
<p>Torpedo Hit</p>
<p>The torpedo did indeed hit, exploding with a roar. Two large explosions in quick succession shook the sea. Flames spread left and right on the deck of the aircraft carrier. In an instant, only the bridge on the left side was not yet burning, but it was soon affected, and the entire ship was finally wrapped in flames. This torpedo plane, from the time it attacked the enemy fleet, to the torpedo, was 倍見悽凉. (Special Correspondent Sasaki) (Ji: Translated from the January 12 Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Thief</h3>
<p>— Liang Xiaoping</p>
<p>A fierce northwest wind, carrying gray sand, flew madly on the street; the sky was dark and gloomy, coldly. The few pedestrians on the road, their hands shrunk in their sleeves, their shoulders raised high, struggled in the cold wind. The rickshaws, dragging empty vehicles, swayed in the middle of the street, waiting for the calling customers. Occasionally, a car sped past, like a wild beast, breaking through the gloom and bringing a tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>It was a calm, sinister, and lifeless early winter evening.</p>
<p>Old Wang was calculating accounts at the counter, constantly making the monotonous sound of the abacus; Little Mao was dozing off at one end of the counter, sleeping soundly; I sat in a corner, lowered my head and silently read a magazine, my heart seemed to be immersed in another world, but I felt the suffocation and dullness of reality. The wind rushed in and swirled, and the cold pressed in tightly.</p>
<p>Occasionally a customer came in, looked at the bookshelves for a while, and went out. After a while, another one came in, casually flipped through a few books, put them back on the shelf, and slipped out.</p>
<p>The surrounding air was scattered, cold, and desolate.</p>
<p>A blue shadow flashed in my eyes, I异的 raised my head, and glimpsed a gap left on the outermost bookshelf, a book was missing.</p>
<p>"Thief!" I exclaimed. I jumped up suddenly, dashed out of the shop door: north, yes, I seemed to see it flash north. Little Mao ran out behind me.</p>
<p>I jumped into the middle of the street, like the sharp eyes of a hunting dog searching for prey, scanning to the left, to the right, forward, and also quickly backward.</p>
<p>A blue long gown! With a thick book tucked under his arm! That red-faced complete works of Shakespeare! Now he stopped at the entrance of the barbershop, greedily looking behind him. I quickened my pace, avoided his gaze, and as I approached his side, I pounced on him fiercely, one hand forcefully grabbing his back collar, and the other hand grabbing one of his arms.</p>
<p>"Ah!" A cry of panic, and the book he was carrying slapped onto the ground. Little Mao picked it up and helped grab his other arm.</p>
<p>After a few futile struggles, he絕望地 looked at me once, and then slumped down, like a defeated hero, completely losing the ability to resist.</p>
<p>"Go," I shouted sternly, grabbing him tightly with both hands, almost using all my strength, even though he no longer struggled stubbornly. Wearing only two layers of thin clothing, I felt that I was grabbing his硬的 skeleton; his whole body was shivering, trembling my hands一阵阵.</p>
<p>Under the gaze of many curious passers-by, the pride of victory floated on my face and glowed. Thoughts quickly swirled in my mind, and blood surged through my body, rushing to my face in waves of heat.</p>
<p>"Please, let me go, this is my first time, I'm really hungry and I don't know what else to do," he pleaded in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>I ignored him, not loosening my grip at all, and cursing this lowly, shameless behavior. I pushed his body step by step towards the shop; as we approached the shop door, Old Wang stretched his neck and waited.</p>
<p>Pedestrians stopped, crowding around to watch, one layer, two layers,……</p>
<p>"Please, let me go, I…"</p>
<p>"Crack" "Slap," two loud sounds in quick succession; "Dare you come again next time?" Old Wang angrily made the first move.</p>
<p>"I won't, I won't. I…"</p>
<p>"Crack" "Slap," again two hits, this time打的是阿林 next door, "Damn it, you don't do proper business and do this kind of thing." 阿林 said straightly.</p>
<p>The red hung down from his nose; flowing down to his chin, dripping onto the stone steps.</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh! Please, let me go, I still have……".</p>
<p>"打" "打". Heavy fists, hitting the back with roars; one, two, Old Wang's fist, 阿林's fist next door, Little Mao's fist, and even the fist of a Western行人 joined in; towards the back, chest, head; like a dense rain, just as fast.</p>
<p>"Oh, help, let me go, I won't come again," pleading, loudly, trembling. Like the miserable cry of a wounded dog.</p>
<p>Fists, as dense as rain, just as fast; and a large black leather shoe foot joined in, kicking wildly at the thighs and buttocks.</p>
<p>Suddenly衝出了重國, staggering, dragging hasty steps,撲着 running south; I watched his blue back shadow disappear in the crowd.</p>
<p>"So young, doesn't do good things, engaged in this kind of勾當," the Western行人, looking at his back shadow, cursed hatefully, and hurried on his way again.</p>
<p>"Didn't send him to the police, got off cheap." One said.</p>
<p>"Really gave him a break, didn't beat him half to death." Another said.</p>
<p>"Haha, I think this beating is enough." Yet another said</p>
<p>"……"</p>
<p>The matter ended like this; 阿林 went back next door. The围着看的八 gradually scattered, Old Wang went back to the counter to calculate accounts again, Little Mao……</p>
<p>The air gradually relaxed from solemn, and gradually became quiet from noisy.</p>
<p>My agitated heart also gradually regained its calm; as if I had escaped from a bizarre dream. But the red fresh blood remained on the stone steps, not yet trampled clean, frustration, pain, remorse, intertwined in my heart.</p>
<p>It is my sin, the sin of that book thief, the sin of Old Wang, the sin of that 西装行人,……, I stared blankly at the sky.</p>
<p>The sky was dark and gloomy, coldly. Gray sand flew on the street.</p>
<h3>Socks</h3>
<p>— Pei Ji</p>
<p>After English class, I found someone laughing behind me. When I turned around, two elegantly dressed female classmates were casting their gaze on my heels. It turned out that I was wearing a pair of torn socks. My mother had patched a large piece of blue cloth on the back of the heels. When I lifted my heels while walking, the entire patch was exposed, and the two oval dark blue patches were quite eye-catching.</p>
<p>The pretty girls found it funny, I wonder if they ever thought that these patched socks were sewn by my dear old mother—the needlework of the only woman in the world who has loved me the most since I was a child. They found it funny, but when I lowered my head and looked at my feet, I swallowed two grateful tears into my stomach. A warm feeling echoed in my heart, and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all. I only felt comforted and encouraged; I wasn't embarrassed at all, I only felt a force in my heart that lifted my head higher. I was proud because I had a mother, this was the needlework of a loving mother!</p>
<p>My socks were all old ones that I had been wearing for several years, because I often wore hard leather shoes, the heels of my mother's socks were worn through with large round holes due to friction. I didn't have money to buy new socks. New socks that cost more than thirty dollars a pair were as useless as paper, and they would break and develop holes in less than two weeks. Having holes with the skin exposed outside like a pair of duck eggs was secondary, but the skin being chafed by the leather shoes was unbearable, so my mother suffered again. The considerate and thoughtful heart of a loving mother is worthy of praise and worship: I never complained to her, and she leaked out more than a dozen pairs of old socks from the clothes chest, and every hole was sewn up by her.</p>
<p>Every cold winter evening with frost and wind, when I finished my homework and went to bed to rest, Dad's snoring was already rising from my mother's room, and the five-watt table lamp on my mother's bedside was still shining listlessly. She sat on the bed mending my torn socks or knitting a woolen sweater for my younger brother. Scraps of cloth, torn socks, scissors, long needles, short needles, wool yarn, and other things were piled messily on the bed, which looked uncomfortable, but my mother always calmly and quietly picked one stitch after another, patched one piece after another, and knitted slowly. She always put on a pair of reading glasses, closed her lips tightly, and worked there silently. The yellow lamplight shone on her face, and her forehead was covered with凹的凸凹的 wrinkles. Every time I walked into her room, she always hung her head and didn't notice me, as if all her energy was concentrated on needlework, until I got close to her, then she smiled and said to me: "Go to sleep quickly: it's getting late." And I always vaguely didn't know what to say to my mother.</p>
<p>During the day, my mother was so busy with trivial housework that she didn't have a moment of leisure. She could only squeeze out some time to sew before going to bed at night, but the time in the evening seemed to be still not enough. Early in the morning, before dawn, she had to put on her clothes and sew a few stitches on the bed. Time, in my mother's eyes, was 貴 than anything else.</p>
<p>Tense work can make people feel refreshed, but it can also make people feel tired and sick. Thinking of my mother, I always secretly bless her health. Two months ago, her eyes had been ill for a month due to overwork, and she shed many tears and suffered a lot of pain. The doctor advised her to rest more and eat more nourishing things, but my mother wouldn't listen to the doctor.</p>
<p>With money, anything can be　得了, it is easy for rich people to buy dozens of pairs of new socks of various colors, but now I don't have money to buy new ones, and my dear old mother mends the old ones pair by pair for me to wear. This is such a laborious time, and moreover, she uses her dim老花眼 to補 in light in 　光熹　中 or under the灯下 where the柝声 has敲过, a son lives for more than twenty years and still has to depend on　 a pair of old and poor parents, how can one not be grateful! How can the young masters and misses who wear silk socks in the university understand me?</p>
<h3>The Cry of a Slave</h3>
<p>— Yang Daming</p>
<p>Swish! Swish!……The whip flashes before my eyes,</p>
<p>Roaring above my head. Ah! This piercing, heart-shaking song! Swish! Swish!……The old, the weak,</p>
<p>Die under the lash; the young, the strong,</p>
<p>Survive by stealth under the lash. No groaning allowed. Sighs and complaints,</p>
<p>Only tears, work. Not a single day of relief, of sickness,</p>
<p>Death—answers for all! Even cattle and horses have a day to chew their fill,</p>
<p>And a time to breathe freely, but slaves are not even this good—</p>
<p>Precisely because their master is… must! Swish! Swish!……The whip kisses the flesh,</p>
<p>Is the price of labor! The whip's brand,</p>
<p>Is the reward for toil! No fatigue, no sickness. A bucket of ice water</p>
<p>Awakens muscles not yet dead! Under the whip, like a lamb,</p>
<p>Obediently, like an old ox, laboriously. No weeping, no groaning allowed,</p>
<p>This is a futile gesture insulting the master. Swish! Swish!……The whip already sings</p>
<p>A "dew" song for the old and weak! Swish! Swish!……The whip again plays</p>
<p>A "welcoming slave" tune for the strong! Alas! Alas!……Generation after generation as slaves! Alas! Alas!……Generation after generation as cattle and horses! Alas! Alas! When will we shake off the shackles of slavery? Rush</p>
<p>To the broad wilderness, breathe the air of freedom!</p>
<h3>To "Tropical Island"</h3>
<p>— Zhuge Xin</p>
<p>Have you ever seen the soaring wings of the Peng bird? Have you ever seen the petrel in the icy ocean struggling with its pure white wings against the collapsing ice floes…? Have you ever heard the song, the collision, of the northern wilderness wind in the trees…?</p>
<p>Don't boast about your body covered in golden threads, don't be greedy for your emerald little arms, don't think of using the sweetness of the lakes and mountains to deceive you or others into being silent. Our beauty is not these, our praises are not these.</p>
<p>Although we also love warmth, we value physical strength even more; although we also need rest, we are eternally unceasing; although we hate hardship, we are even more determined to overcome it…</p>
<p>Don't boast about the sweet fragrance under your red branches, don't show off the big muscles in your little skin, don't sing in a low voice about the triviality of the ocean… You have no angry silence, no roar, you are not worthy, even if you are a heroic lover, they will not love your songs when they want to wield their swords.</p>
<h3>Forward</h3>
<p>— Cai Yanyan</p>
<p>Although, today, I am scattered in a distant corner,</p>
<p>The sigh of a dying insect brushes against my heels,</p>
<p>Yet I have not waved to the sorrow of despair.</p>
<p>Whenever the black shadow of tongue-numbing pain comes to invade my spirit,</p>
<p>I always sing old, impassioned short songs,</p>
<p>Drawing some courage, drawing some strength,</p>
<p>To move forward again, forward again! One step is two steps…</p>
<h3>Spring in the Pawnshop</h3>
<p>— Wu Tao</p>
<p>If there were no calendar to remind them, the people in the pawnshop might never realize the arrival of spring.</p>
<p>Look! Those high, deep walls, the grim iron bars on top, are just like a prison. And the people inside—especially the apprentices—become prisoners serving indefinite sentences; because the pawnshop system stipulates that apprentices cannot step out of the pawnshop at will. Except for a few days' holiday during the New Year, they are always imprisoned in the ancient pawnshop, unable to get a bit of sunlight, unable to smell a trace of fresh air. The whole world in their minds is just this small pawnshop. Alas! This rule is cruel, feudal, dyeing the lives of the apprentices entirely in a gray color; ruthlessly destroying, burying their youth. Moreover, there is fundamentally no term limit for apprenticeships; those who advance slowly may still be apprentices even at thirty or forty years old.</p>
<p>And I, am one of those imprisoned under this feudal, poisonous system! An apprentice. I understand that if my life is to be lived with even a little meaning, I must resist this feudal demon, and I absolutely cannot obediently become its sacrifice again. So, partly due to the impulse of a desire for knowledge, and partly wanting to have more contact with the wider world outside, I joined three older fellow apprentices who sympathized with me, and made an unprecedented request to the rigid, stern, old manager:</p>
<p>"Sir! We humbly believe that we are very superficial in all aspects of knowledge and experience. Working in this increasingly complex society is truly inconvenient in many ways. Therefore, we now respectfully make a presumptuous request to you: please allow us to read some books in nearby tutoring schools in our spare time in the morning or evening…"</p>
<p>Before I could finish speaking, he became enraged like a mad lion, kicking his feet and shouting:</p>
<p>"You lunatics! You actually have the wild idea of going to school to study. You must know that once you become an apprentice, you must wholeheartedly serve the shop loyally. How can you go outside to study and fool around again? Hahahaha! You are really crazy, crazy!"</p>
<p>A surge of resentment, a surge of doubt, filled each of our hearts. He kept scolding us "crazy". Did we become thieves? Commit crimes? Go mad?</p>
<p>"You're really bold, you're just daydreaming!" After taking a puff of his pipe, he mumbled a few more words. Then, he asked in a stern voice like a judge interrogating a robber: "Who started this?"</p>
<p>"It was me!" I immediately roared out, my voice particularly strong.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's you, I didn't see that you were small, but you're really bold, if you want to study, you can just go back to your hometown. My shop, cannot tolerate you being so free." The old man, while clenching his fist and pounding the table, kept scolding me angrily.</p>
<p>I really couldn't bear this unreasonable scolding from him, I wanted to resist, wanted to thoroughly strike and stab his stubborn mind. But when I remembered my mother's instructions to me when I came to the shop, "My child! You must be cautious in your work, listen to what people say, and never make Mom sad!" My courage completely turned into trembling and hesitation. Not only did I not dare to argue with him, I didn't even have the courage to look at him. My face burned red, I just stared blankly at the corner of the wall.</p>
<p>After a moment, he suddenly waved his hand and told us to leave, so I, like a prisoner who had been pardoned, hurriedly left the room.</p>
<p>From then on, this group of us old apprentices became even more cowardly. A passive atmosphere filled everyone's words and ambitions: because we had realized that our lives would forever be controlled by the magic grip of this stubborn and autocratic old man. We also wanted to struggle, also wanted to create our own new paradise, but, heavens! With our skills trained under the slow and rigid pawnshop business, where in society is our place to eat? Where can we create new glory? Therefore, whether we are active or passive, life is always so gray, without the slightest color.</p>
<p>The spring of 1944 came slowly again, she bestowed upon this world, this humanity, much comfort and beauty. But we have failed her. The warm spring sunshine, the spring colors on the streets, the spring scenery of nature: are only things we yearn for in our minds, who says "spring is ours"!</p>
<p>On the monotonous journey,</p>
<p>When you occasionally stop to rest,</p>
<p>You also think of the old lamplight,</p>
<p>The magnificent songs of the oxen,</p>
<p>The laughter in the light boat:</p>
<p>Perhaps, these fragmented memories disappear in the magnificent painting,</p>
<p>For justice, for survival,</p>
<p>Knowing only to move forward in the vast wilderness—</p>
<p>Not stopping to rest for a moment,</p>
<p>Exhausting all your life's energy to rush forward,</p>
<p>Seeing the torch of light,</p>
<p>Is the true symbol of your existence.</p>
<p>There is paradise in the clouds over there,</p>
<p>There are banquets on the mountain peaks,</p>
<p>There are the high songs of the youth,</p>
<p>There is the laughter of the free,</p>
<p>Making you younger, healthier,</p>
<p>In the distant heaven,</p>
<p>May the strong men of the country take care!</p>
<p>Ah! I have tightened my pace forward even more,</p>
<p>Similarly pursuing the front line of light with you.</p>
<h3>Early Rising</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhai</p>
<p>A recluse rises early to take advantage of the clear sky, a line of morning light breaks the dawn mist, indistinct mountains swallow the night's sleep, rippling Green Creek absorbs the flowing spring. The moon's roundness gradually decreases like a waning ring, the wind's sharpness can dispel the approach of heat, if one's actions concern the nation's fate, the rooster's crow should spur one on like Zuti's whip.</p>
<h3>New Cold</h3>
<p>— Cao Yuning</p>
<p>Vast floating clouds stir in the four corners, a new cold crept onto the tower last night, the moon over the waterside pavilion is unintentionally green, the wind on the desolate city deliberately destroys. The cloud-veiled mountains of the old country after the tide recedes, news from afar arrives with the flying geese, lately I alone feel the emotions of the New Pavilion, often shedding tears as I toast a cup.</p>

<h3>Athletes Should Not Desert Their Posts on the Eve of a Game</h3>
<p>—Thoughts After Watching Yesterday's China-Portugal Match—</p>
<p>Yesterday at half-past ten in the morning, there was a wonderful soccer match at Yiyi Field, between the Chinese team and Portugal, as part of a charity match organized by the Football Association. The audience, awed by the reputation of both teams and the impressive lineup announced in the newspapers, came flocking. The stands were packed, creating an unprecedented scene. Unexpectedly, of the twenty-one players selected for the Chinese team, only eleven arrived, and with one player injured, they had to fight with only ten players from beginning to end, inevitably suffering a crushing defeat, which cannot but give one pause.</p>
<p>Absence on the Eve of a Game Shows Poor Spirit</p>
<p>The players who were absent from the Chinese team were Li Tiansheng, Cai Shengmiao, Gao Baozheng, Fei Chunhua, Zheng Yingquan, Liu Xianhan, Qu Yongfu, Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Wu Qixiang, and others, a total of ten people. Among them, Zhuang and Liang, according to Jia Yougen's words to reporters: both could not spare time due to temporary matters. The rest of the eight top players, who all belong to the same team. The reporter witnessed that most of them arrived at the field, whispering to each other, seemingly an organized absence, or perhaps they had their own difficulties, but we always feel that their spirit is not commendable. The most important thing for soccer players is spirit, followed by the performance of skills, and victory or defeat comes after these two. The players who were absent this time are all top-notch players, and also eagerly anticipated by fans. Failing to fight on the eve of a game is not only a bad spirit, which will forever remain in our minds, but also how can we face the thousands of fans who came from afar and suffered disappointment? Moreover, this battle is also to represent the Chinese team, to win glory and wash away shame, and should know its importance. For first-class players to have this kind of performance, I think it is a big mistake. Now that the matter has passed, we, standing on the position of a third party, very much hope that they will correct their mistakes, pull back from the brink, and not lose their heroic character. Sincerely hoping!</p>
<p>The players who attended, fighting against the odds, were able to fight bravely to the end. In the end, even in an absolutely losing position (three - 〇) they were able to tie the score (three - three). Their courage is worthy of praise. Unfortunately, they lost one point at the end, inevitably suffering a crushing defeat. However, the fans in the stands were all satisfied, admiring the spirit of the fighting players beyond victory or defeat. In addition to these thoughts, I will briefly describe the process of yesterday's battle.</p>
<p>At the Start of the Game, the Portuguese Team Showed Their Power</p>
<p>The Portuguese team attacked first, the Chinese team's coordination was not yet mature, and in less than ten minutes, V. Su Ruo scored a goal in the midst of the chaos. Just as the Chinese team was preparing to counterattack, Liu Zuruo on the central defense line was injured and left the field. Lacking a replacement, they had to fight with ten players, and morale plummeted. For a time, they could not recover, and internal affairs became troublesome. The enemy general showed his power, and the Chinese team could only take a defensive position. At the twenty-minute mark, the enemy center forward Fafanmei entangled with Lin Gen and sent the ball in, two to 〇. The Chinese team then quickly transferred Yu Liming to the central defense to strengthen the rear and focus on defending and then attacking. However, the enemy's momentum was strong, and at thirty-eight minutes, V. Su Ruo was again scored by our goalkeeper, losing three goals in a row. The athletes were filled with anger, Han Longhai and Jia Youliang bravely launched a joint attack. Unexpectedly, heaven did not help us, Youliang missed two sure-shot balls, both because he was too cautious, resulting in weak shots that were saved by the goalkeeper, which was a pity. The first half ended with three to 〇.</p>
<p>The Chinese Counterattack Was Magnificent for a Time</p>
<p>In the second half, the lineup of the Chinese and Portuguese teams underwent major changes, using a rotation strategy. Our team continued to fight with ten players from the first half. After the start, our side took advantage of the fact that the opponent's formation was not yet stable and launched a massive attack. The enemy's defense was greatly loosened, and the four knights of our front line were seen passing the ball like pearls, with a magnificent momentum that cannot be described. Who would have believed that the enemy goalkeeper, who was usually mediocre and unworthy, would at this time save every ball, save with divine inspiration, which was beyond human power. The audience could not help but stamp their feet and sigh, and believed that the goalkeeper's performance was an unexpected performance. However, unity is strength, and heaven does not disappoint people. Han Longhai, in the midst of his repeated failed attacks, single-handedly charged straight in, the ball hitting the wooden post and bouncing in. Once the record was broken, the athletes were revitalized. Li Yao dribbled the ball from the left and cut to the center, landing right in front of the goal. The opponent's defender Ma Shan'er and our team's Sun Jinshun jumped up at the same time, the ball landing on Ma Shan'er and bouncing in, resulting in an own goal. Our side scored two goals in a row, determined to turn defeat into victory, supporting each other from front to back, and were unstoppable. In a blink of an eye, Han Longhai, who was unparalleled for a time, broke through in the middle, his feet flying, and the ball went into the net, a beautiful sight. The stadium was filled with cheers. Unexpectedly, only about ten minutes before the end of the game, the cheers were still in the ears, Lin Gen backfired, and was scored by Braga, which was unfortunate. In the end, they suffered a crushing defeat with a score of three to four.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Skills of Each Player on Both Teams</p>
<p>Speaking of the battle between the two teams, our team, although fighting with ten players, did have points that were admirable, with the attack being better than the defense. However, in the first half of the first half, it seemed that they were a little lax. Han Longhai was the most distinctive character, not just because he scored two goals. Looking at his tireless running, he deserves praise. Jia Youliang's merits and demerits are equal, he has more courage than skill, and he should be held responsible for not scoring two sure-shot balls. Li Fuzhen was less impressive than in the previous two games, mainly due to poor coordination. Zhang Lin Gen worked the hardest, fighting hard with Fafanmei, and his contribution was great. Goalkeeper Zhang Banglun was mediocre, only saving one dangerous ball, and the rest were scored. Zhang should train more.</p>
<p>The Portuguese team did not show anything particularly impressive yesterday, especially their good luck with the ball, and V. Su Ruo can be considered the most promising forward. His running and tackling are all methodical. The rest, Ma Shan, Kao Sitanweike Tai, all have the skills of veterans. Goalkeeper A. Luochaiyuan had a surprising performance, mainly due to luck. If he can maintain this performance in the future, he will not be unworthy of being a great talent.</p>
<p>In short, the Chinese team lost yesterday, not because of their fault, but because of their bad luck with the ball. (Jie)</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on "The Difficulty of Being a Basketball Referee"</h3>
<p>— Mei Bixian</p>
<p>After this journal published my humble work "The Difficulty of Being a Basketball Referee" in the last issue, basketball senior Xie Yiqin invited me to talk. (Mr. Xie works at the Salt Industry Bank and has a great deal of research on basketball, serving as the leader and instructor of the Green Team's women's basketball team.) He said that there are still several points that should be paid attention to in basketball refereeing. His words are very pertinent and indeed insightful. As the Western Youth Games is about to end and the Chinese Youth Games is about to open, I will once again not presume my shallowness and record the following. And add my humble opinion as a supplement to the previous article, and sincerely hope that basketball referees will adopt it.</p>
<p>(1) The Clothing Must Be Conspicuous</p>
<p>Basketball games involve extremely fast movements, and if the referee's clothing is similar to that of the players, it is easy to cause misunderstandings. We often see that in tense situations, because the clothing is similar, the players do not have time to distinguish carefully, and they often mistakenly recognize the referee as a teammate and pass the ball to the referee. Therefore, the referee's clothing is best regulated to a uniform style, and it is preferable to have conspicuous colors.</p>
<p>(2) The Spirit Must Be Full</p>
<p>If the referee can be energetic and full of vigor, it will definitely improve the interest in the game and add a lot of color. On the contrary, if they are listless and perfunctory (Xi Qing Kai Qimiluotian was always like this), it will turn a tight and exciting game into a loose situation. Therefore, if the referee knows that he has a duty tomorrow, he should go to bed early tonight to conserve his energy, so that he may be successful.</p>
<p>(3) The Words Should Be Simple and Clear</p>
<p>Except for games involving Western teams, if the Chinese teams are competing against each other (the Western Youth Games may be due to the environment, as the clerks are all Westerners), then they are all Chinese compatriots, and simple Mandarin should be used, and English is not necessary. (It is said that when our country participated in the Berlin World Games, the athletes often spoke English among themselves. The Germans were very surprised when they heard it. Although it is a small matter, it is worth noting, so I add this note). The pronunciation should be heavy and clear, not too fast. Most importantly, avoid using Western and Chinese languages ​​at the same time, as it is inevitable that there will be grammatical errors, such as saying "Number what number comma foul", etc., repeating the points, incoherent, making a fool of oneself, how can it be taken?</p>
<p>(4) Judgment Must Not Be Hesitant</p>
<p>Once the whistle blows, the judgment should be announced immediately. Orders must be carried out, and there must be no hesitation, so that the players can take advantage of this time to express something. Once the judgment has been made, even if there is an error, there is no reason to change it. This is the way to maintain the dignity of the referee.</p>
<p>(5) Must Have Considerable Skill</p>
<p>For the basic movements of catching and passing the ball, at least a glimpse of the basics must be known, otherwise, if the ball is dropped and there is no target for the pass, time will be wasted, and the time spent will not be noticed by the timer. This is of great importance in major competitions.</p>
<p>In addition, familiarizing oneself with the rules so that one can answer fluently, and having a strong physique so that one can run without tiring, are also necessary conditions for a basketball referee. If one can do this, then one will not fail to be a typical referee. In a blink of an eye, the Chinese Youth Basketball League will open. In addition to hoping that the matter of beating the referee like in the Western Youth Games will never happen again, I also hope that the gentlemen of the committee will adopt my words and point them out!</p>
<h3>Easy Fitness Exercises (10) (2)</h3>
<p>— Tom, translated by Yide</p>
<p>27, Muscles of the Upper Arm</p>
<p>Exercise 1</p>
<p>To develop the muscles of the upper arm, there are two special exercises: the first is to develop the biceps and triceps, which are the muscles for "lifting" and "striking". This exercise makes the front and back of the arm develop completely, and has a beautiful shape when viewed from the side.</p>
<p>Extend both arms horizontally to the left and right, palms facing up. Close both hands as if holding a dumbbell tightly, and use the forearms to bend towards the shoulders, without lowering the elbows or bending the wrists. Then extend to the left and right, returning to the original position. Be careful at first, and then use force to stretch, as if striking an object.</p>
<p>Upper arms extending horizontally to the left and right, bending and extending (10 times each)</p>
<p>Note Special exercises or individual exercises, from 25 to 50 times.</p>
<p>Exercise 2</p>
<p>The second exercise for the upper arm is on the outside of the arm, that is, the depression between the shoulder and elbow. Otherwise, the arm cannot develop completely, and it is especially easy to see when viewed from the front or back.</p>
