<h3>決戰政治</h3>
<p>[必勝的取得，首先在於確信必勝，無必勝信念，而取得必勝者，恐怕世界上就沒有這樣事。]這是日本新聞界前輩德富蘇峯翁，在其所著[必勝國民讀本]中所說的話。當此大東亞民族存亡的生死決戰階段，每一個參戰國家自應共同確信必勝，堅定必勝信念，才能取得必勝，完成民族解放戰的任務。我們是大東亞戰爭參戰國家的一員，自然不能例外。　　然而，堅定必勝信念，還只是取得必勝的一半保證。同時，更需要必勝工作的實踐。有了信念，而無實踐工作相配合，這個信念是不會實現的。只有工作而無堅定的信念，偶然遇到環境上的演變，工作很易鬆弛，同樣難於完成目的。所以，我們一方面旣然要堅定必勝信念，一方面更要實踐必勝工作，輿信念完全配合。　　怎樣實踐必勝工作呢？在目前的情勢適環境中，最迫切的就是[決戰政治[——與應決戰需要的修明政治。我們會在八月二十九日社評，提出[必勝政治論]，是說：[政治辦得好，就是取得必勝的保證]。現在我們說[決戰政治]，不但消極的清明政治，並且積極的適應決戰需要。　　推進決戰政治，首先還是堅定必勝信念，因爲[必勝]是我們今天的中心信仰，絕無猶豫動搖的餘地。其次，必須有勇於革新的精神。決戰階段是多麼堅張，決不能以維持現狀爲滿足，因爲在今日是維持現狀，在明日就是退步。譬如發見地方政治有不良現象，就須迅速澈底革新。如不迅速，則日久積重難返。如不澈底，則枝節於事無補。又如發現某種計劃或設施工作，與預期成效不符甚或相反，而不適於中國國情民情的，雖爲盟邦建議，亦應立即提出，懇切商討革新，不使其後果不利於中國國計民生，更不利於協力戰爭。總括言之，在目前決佔階段，無論任何設施，唯一要求有利於國計民生，更有利於大東亞戰爭。　　此外，用人唯才一點，實爲政治進步之不二法門，尤其在決戰政治中更爲重要。諸葛亮在其出師表中說：[親賢臣，遠小人，此先漢之所以興隆也；親小人，遠賢臣，此後漢之所以傾頹也。]無論古今中外歷史上，用人優，則政治良，用人劣，則政治窳，毫無例外。此次國府局部調動中樞及地方長官，我們認爲不過職務更調而已，於用人唯才一點，並無關係。我們不能無疑的，在甲地從政無成績者，是否調至乙地後，便有成績？在甲官職任內無成績者，是否調爲乙官職後便有成績？十數年來，政治上人事更迭，總落於走馬燈式的窠臼，調來調去的人物，在人民眼中看得太熟了。不禁疑問：這些人物，第一，有否必勝信念？第二，有否担當決戰政治的毅力？第三，有否苦幹實幹的精神？　　最後，我們爲期決戰政治的建立，希望當局特別注重用人唯才，不能僅着眼於中樞人物中調動，而須吸引在野人物中眞具才能者，務必適人適事，以新民間耳目，達成決戰政治。</p>
<h3>日機隊巧妙夜襲帛琉方面敵艦羣沉毀舟艇五十戰車十五輛</h3>
<p>中部太平洋日軍某基地二十一日中央社電　日機隊之一部，增巧妙接近帛琉方面結集之敵艦隊，十八日晚間炸毀驅逐艦一艘，計戰至十八日晨，共炸沉敵舟艇三十艘，炸毀敵舟艇二十艘及戰車十五輛。　　東京二十一日中央社電　據中部太平洋基地電，日航空部隊，十八日傍晚急裝培里琉島敵登陸軍，使其陣地中彈起火，並於哥斯索爲海峽附近，擊毀敵大型運輸船一艘。　　東京二十日中央社電　中部太平洋基地電，敵機八十架左右，會於十九日白畫來襲帛琉島，計自六日起至十四日止之九日間，來襲帛琉地區之敵機約一千六百八十架，培里琉地區約一千三百二十架，雅浦約五百架，總計共達三千五百架，爲日軍擊落一百零七架，並有四十八架受巨創。</p>
<h3>培里琉日軍力戰挫敵</h3>
<p>中部太平洋基地二十一日中央社電　敵軍已在培里琉島登陸，惟其所配備之強力部隊約一師，由於日守軍之猛攻，已蒙重創，因此敵軍自席捲培里琉島後即放棄侵帛琉之企圖，但敵今仍在積極增援，刻日方對此項優勢之敵，續行肉搏攻擊中。十八日下午，敵又藉艦砲射擊之掩護下，期以戰車數十輛突破中央高地南部，但經日砲兵攻擊後，使其戰車破燬大半。惟於十九日晨，敵又以龐大部隊，反覆攻擊該方面，於是日軍乃與之激戰，歷三小時，敵又重創後不支潰退。此次來攻之敵，今已陷於混亂狀態，其所擁有之戰車，亦遭相當損害，然敵軍火力在量的方面，正重壓日軍之事實，實無可否認也。　　中部太平洋基地二十一日中央社電　培里琉島日軍，仍保守該島機塲北側地區（即該島中央高地一帶），同時並與砲兵部隊之猛攻相呼應·連續夜襲敵軍，予其主力以重創。敵軍雖屢次加強砲擊及增援戰車，圖深入日軍中央高地陣地，然均未逞　　東京二十一日中央社電　據中太平洋日軍某基地電，培里琉島日軍，於敵軍登陸後，遂作勇敢之防禦戰，隨時對敵軍加以肉搏，自十六日應戰至十九日指曉，其間大規模攻擊，會有七次之多，敵軍損失達三千二百之衆，自敵軍企圖於培里琉島登陸，至十九日指曉，蒙受損失，實達八千七百以上，故該島戰況，其悲壯遠駕乎大宮島·迭尼安島等以上。</p>
<h3>安格維爾島日軍奮戰</h3>
<p>中部太平洋基地二十一日中央社電　安格維爾島登陸之敵軍，十七日來在該島東北端設置橋頭堡，十七·十八兩日，對日軍陣地猛加砲擊，但日軍仍英勇奮戰，至十七日下午七時，日守備隊收獲戰果：○擊沉敵舟艇約三十艘，擊毀二十餘艘。○擊毀戰車十五輛。　　東京二十一日中央社電　據中部太平洋電，安格維爾島登陸敵軍，因遭日軍連次猛攻，損失甚重，乃逐次增強兵力，十九日敵軍抵遠距該島西部中央地帶城市之一公里地點，日守軍當即於燈台高地附近邀擊之，予以重創後，將其擊退。</p>
<h3>肇慶附近擊毀美機兩架</h3>
<p>中國前綫基地廿一日中央社電　渝美軍P５１型機五架，十九日上午十時許，空襲肇慶西方之日軍第一綫部隊近郊，被日軍戰門機擊落及擊毀各一架。</p>
<h3>日宇垣大將訪岡部指揮官</h3>
<p>北平二十一日中央社電　日宇垣大將，二十日訪問日華北岡部最高指揮官懇談並出席招待宴。</p>
<h3>德蘇兩軍均開入芬蘭</h3>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德山岳軍總司令今晨宣布：極北戰區之德軍，已入芬境，會受德軍保護三年之芬蘭，已成爲決戰之地。蘇軍旣已越過芬邊境，德軍此舉，實爲戰略所必然。芬方會希望歐洲之大敵將於芬邊境停止前進，但此種希望已成泡影，其結果使芬境內之村莊化爲戰區而已。德軍對此不幸事件，殊不能負責，蓋蘇·芬談判停戰，已危及德之安全，德軍應實行對策也</p>
<h3>希特勒赴西綫親指揮作戰</h3>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　西綫重點移至北部地方，反軸心軍集中空軍部隊，展開攻防戰，至爲激烈，德軍英勇抵抗，反軸心軍難於進展。據美聯社前綫消息，希特勒元首親赴前綫，指揮固守荷蘭國境至薩爾溪谷一帶之德軍，似將使用Ｖ一號，十九日予賣士河畔·美軍陣地損害甚大。據柏林情報，德軍在亞琛南部地區大舉反攻，由佛雜爾及由坪方面向斯特拉斯堡進攻之美軍，均被阻止。據合衆社前綫消息，南錫麥次地區及培爾福基勃方面之美軍，遭德軍猛烈抵抗。</p>
<h3>栗原部長講述戰局有利進展</h3>
<p>空戰重要性亦愈增強　　東京二十一日中央社電　日海軍報道部長栗原大佐，二十日晚於此間日比谷公會堂之航空決戰中央講演會中，以[大東亞戰爭與飛機]爲題，講述戰局之有利進展情形及關於航空人員之充實，其要義如次：於大東亞戰爭中主要利器，當爲飛機，此乃無所疑慮者，蓋於此次戰爭中，唯有飛機發揮有最大效能，且此亦爲此次戰爭之特徵。飛機之活躍，不論於陸地及海洋，皆有同樣之效力，尤其海戰，如不能確保制空權。則制海權亦必因之喪失，作戰當陷於不利地位。今日敵軍之攻擊，巳愈迫近日本土，於此戰塲漸迫近本土之同時，空戰之重要性，亦隨之愈爲增強，現在日軍機塲，多數已整備完畢，又空戰時必須之軍需品·燃料之補給等，亦因補給綫之縮短，而趨有利。因戰綫之縮短，陸海兩軍航空部隊之協力，亦日趨緊密，關於駕駛乘員之數量，亦隨之增加，現在正配備於各航空基地與海上機動部隊中，靜待戰機之成熟。</p>
<h3>華南日軍突入雲浮城</h3>
<p>先鋒距離桂林九里　　華南前綫二十一日中央社電　西江南岸一帶西進之日軍有力部隊，十七日正午，於桐州附近渡過西江支流新興江，前進約四公里。於十九日指曉，將渝第百五十八師據點雲浮縣包圍，日軍右翼部隊先後攻佔桐油園初城大源川羅沙等地，左翼部隊亦次第佔領聚門墟黃岡大山腳等要衝，自兩方堅壓雲浮，十九日正午，一部先遣部隊已突入雲浮縣城，繼之各部隊亦衝入城內，並繼續追擊向西方潰走之渝軍。其中一部已到達雲浮西南十公里地帶。按雲浮縣城駐有渝軍第一百五十八師，師長劉棟材等幹部，以警備肇慶一帶，然於日軍怒壽之攻勢下，自十七日渝軍約一二千已開始撤退，據飛機偵察，該渝軍刻於雲浮羅定間數地敗走中。　　里斯本二十一日中央社電　向華南桂林進擊之日軍，巳逼近該市，左翼部隊日先鋒，亦抵桂林九里以內。</p>
<h3>日軍攻衡陽桂林造成輝皇戰績</h3>
<p>三品報道部長談話　　中央社訊　此次日軍展開湖南作戰以來，在前綫某根據地，担任指導報道宣傳之日駐華派遣軍報道部長三品中佐，業於二十日來滬。昨日特接見記者團，就此次作戰戰績，及目下桂林方面戰況，詳加說明。茲誌三品中佐談話大意如後：○截至衡陽陷落爲止之作戰，因敵人澈底破壞交通路綫，以及渝美空軍之活躍，日軍接濟頗感困難。同時將士不能不發揮</p>
<h3>廢寢忘食</h3>
<p>之苦門精神。衡陽之敵軍幾全部爲湖南籍人，故彼等基於愛鄉土之觀念，抵抗殊爲猛烈，致日軍作戰條件，處處均屬不利。尚幸雖值溽署，但軍中患疾病者絕無，將士得全力以赴，造成輝皇戰績。○目下進行中之桂林方面進攻作戰，比較衡陽以前之作戰，稍感順利。現日軍繼續</p>
<h3>快速進攻</h3>
<p>據情報稱，桂林已極呈動搖，渝美空軍已開始破壞各種設施而後退，由此可明白敵人，尤其是渝美空軍，因日軍越向中國西南部深入，則其蠢動愈益激烈。同時預料今後或將有美國式重慶軍，或美地上軍一類之怪物出現，日軍作戰時指導精神，始終實踐當初之宣言。雖然是重慶軍，但其</p>
<h3>不抵抗者</h3>
<p>不視作敵人，蓋日軍作戰目標，乃在驅逐侵略東亞之英美敵人也。溫州方面作戰，敵人戰力極弱，故進展甚速·○如上述美軍或將除空軍之外，並有地上部隊出現於大陸，此說雖屬預想，但不得不防，切忌疏忽。此種美軍地上部隊之援渝，渝宣傳部長梁寒操</p>
<h3>會表歡迎</h3>
<p>謂其不啻爲中國之救世主。但吾人即使渝方對此問題，似乎有深切反省的必要。蓋如果美國在大陸派遣大量地上部隊，而能獲得勝利，使日本敗退，但該時美國是否眞正待重慶當作友人，使中國得到光榮的獨立。彼狡猾之英美，百年來榨取中國，不信重慶人士對此已忘盡怨恨或反表感謝，百年前之英美，企圖使中國淪爲殖民地，至今日彼等之手段</p>
<h3>依然不變</h3>
<p>逐步將一部份渝方當局首腦把握，再謀支配全中國。且今日彼空軍更旁若無人，將作戰指揮權奪爲已有，實際敵美已視中國爲殖民地矣。破壞中國統一者英美也，中日共同之敵人亦英美也，吾人顧歐洲戰局及太平洋戰局，美軍反攻氣勢益烈，吾人應不使敵人有侵蝕大陸之餘地，更進而確保完固之態勢，使中國固守爲東亞之中國。</p>
<h3>日陸省奏呈拉孟騰越守備隊忠烈</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日拉孟·騰越兩守備部隊，在　甸方面猛烈奮鬥，已歷多時，其間嘗予雲南方面渝軍以重創，對日軍之全盤作戰上之貢獻，亦至爲深巨，茲該兩守備部隊於克盡其使命後，終於全體壯烈殉國。此項消息業由日大本營於二十日發表，查該兩守備部隊之偉勳，實足以驚天地而泣鬼神，囊者日南方陸軍最高指揮官及緬甸方面陸軍最高指揮官，曾授與彼等以獎狀，以褒功烈，而勵來茲。此次壯烈殉國後，日陸軍省亦會將其壯烈情形奏呈日天皇陛下，該省並發表命令如左：日祟軍省昭和十九年（民國三十三年）九月二十日發表：日拉孟·騰越兩守備部隊之偉勘，前此會由南方陸軍最高指揮官及緬甸方面陸軍最高指揮官分別賜予獎狀褒揚，茲以該兩守備隊壯烈殉國，用特將其忠烈奏呈天皇陛下。　　東京二十一日中央社電　自日軍對伊姆法爾方面展開攻勢以來，英·美深恐東印方面反軸心軍之防衛陣勢趨於崩潰，遂要求渝方派遣雲南遠征軍，由怒江正面進攻，以威脅日背後，同時並企圖打通來多公路，五月中旬，雲南方面渝軍十六個師，即大舉渡過怒江，形成與日軍對峙之情勢，自此怒江戰綫遂展開決戰，結果於拉孟·騰越方面，日軍終於全員壯烈犧牲，但怒江戰綫全綫作戰之主動權，仍在日軍手中，渝軍企圖打通來多公路事，卒成泡影。渝軍自反攻以來迄現在止，各地戰況如次：</p>
<h3>拉孟騰越戰門經過</h3>
<p>拉孟守軍，以極少之兵力抵抗渝軍之攻勢，自始至今，實達百餘日，至九月七日，卒因衆寡不敵，而全體壯烈殉國，進攻之渝軍兵力，係第十一集團所部六個師，其數足抵日守軍之六十倍。騰越日軍，於渝第二十集團軍所部五個師之圍攻下，計前後會與之對抗二閱月之久，其間並未使二十倍之渝軍侵入寸土，爰渝軍之包圍戰至後半期，因毫無成效，遂採取與要塞攻擊戰法相同之隧道戰法，即挖掘隧道通至城壁，結果城壁城門全行破壞，遂侵入城內，茲後雙方即行展開壯烈之白刃戰及手溜彈戰，最後日軍僅餘十數名，然仍單獨奮勇應戰，直至十四日遂全體陣亡，蔣介石氏於深爲感動之餘，乃訓示全軍，其言有云，怒江戰綫渝軍雖擁有優秀之裝備與龐大之兵力，然猶未能使攻擊有利進行獲致所期之戰果，反之，日拉孟，騰越兩軍，雖戰至最後一人，猶視死如歸，完成任務，此正實足爲吾等軍人之教訓，今後渝軍尤非以日軍壯烈奮鬥之精神爲楷模不可云云。能陵方面日軍，於數倍之渝軍包圍下，奮戰二月餘，旋日軍主力集合於龍陵周圍，九月三日，內外呼應展開攻勢，十日終告解圍，更由西側轉將該地一帶之六七師渝軍包圍，予以澈底之打擊，使其向東敗退，刻日軍正步步堅逼中。</p>
<h3>怒江戰綫日軍主動</h3>
<p>渝雲南遠征軍五月中旬以來，動員十六個師之龐大兵力，展開攻勢，但爲日軍奮戰所阻，刻下怒江全面戰局反漸對渝方不利，英·美本來期望甚殷，至是大失所望，最近竟對蔣氏表示不滿，實則蔣氏亦輕視英·美方面之督戰，甚至竟出動秘藏之第二百師送赴前綫，以轉換戰局，阻此亦在龍陵附近爲日軍精銳擊潰敗走寵陵東方，是則怒江戰綫在日軍之主動下，正見有新發展，渝方打破來多公路之企圖，終未得逞。日軍各部隊自五月中旬渝軍開始攻勢以來直至今日，所予渝軍之損害，一如日大本營發表，共爲七萬三千人，以師別之，計殲滅者一師，爲第三十九師，予以潰滅打擊者（損害在三分之二以上）五師，爲第七十六，第二十八，第八十七及榮譽等一師，預備第二師。擊潰者（損害在三分之一以上）六師，爲第百九十八，第百十六，第三，第八十日，第百零三及第八十八師。予以相當損害者四師，爲第百三十，第九，第二百及新編第三十三師，渝方十六師仍未受損害者僅一師。</p>
<h3>龍陵日軍擴大戰果</h3>
<p>日軍前綫某基地二十一日中央社電　龍陵地區日軍，自解除渝軍重圍以來，即以有力態勢急速進展，刻將渝軍包入重圍，節節擴大戰果，該方面之戰局，已呈好轉，此不僅對來多公路予以打擊，即予其他亦有甚大影響，次於日軍之確保龍陵，渝軍連結騰越·龍陵·拉孟之三角形戰略綫·已各感孤立，尤其騰越一帶，五師渝軍失掉後方補給路，其戰略企圖已歸失敗。按渝軍今次侵攻目標，在打通緬甸公路，故有與北緬戰綫進展相應，而向緬甸內部南下之計策，此實不可忽略，因此渝軍對奪回來多公路上之龍陵，乃注以最大力量，以九師編成之大軍集於該地，反覆反攻，歷二月餘，然今由日軍新攻勢之展開，滇編公路自勿待論，即來多公路之開啓，亦呈一大危機。言及渝雲南遠征軍之裝備，殆爲美國式，乃渝軍之精銳，然開始作戰以來，四月餘損耗僅盡棄屍體已達三萬餘，因龍陵附近第十一集團軍之大殲滅戰，其傷亡損失，定當益爲增加也。</p>
<h3>南匯之行</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>記者從青浦歸來，稍事休息，便又作南滙之行。　　南滙縣北隣川沙，南接奉賢，東面東海，西即浦江，人民大都崇尚樸實，惟與浦鎭爲該縣交通滙集之區，商業比較繁盛，故有小上海之稱。　　滬南道上　　自滬至南滙途徑，從十六舖東昌渡過渡，即至東亞汽車站購票，票價三百元，上午八時十五分開車，由東昌路向南，至張家浜檢問所，乘客例須下車受檢，南至白運涇，該處亦有檢問所，稍南，車即折向東行，與往來於周家渡與周浦鎭間之鐵道（俗稱小火車）相並而行，比過三林塘檢問所，適遇由周浦開來之火車，其行駛時之速率較諸上海之電車尤覺緩慢，據聞，即此巳時有出軋之慮，故一般行旅，寗出四倍之高價，乘坐汽車，不僅爲便捷計，蓋亦求安全也。　　東行約一小時抵周浦，市街雖不甚寬，而頗整潔，市容熱鬧。記者下榻於周浦旅社，稍事休息後，即往近郊一遊。　　稻作收成　　自周浦西行至傳家宅，邨中太多傳姓者，詢以今年收成如何？據稱：[本地稻作分爲[早][遲]兩種，早稻之先收者爲頭稻，遲收者爲二稻，晚稻則爲三稻，頭這之收威在九成以上，惟爲數極徵，以其漲性較差，故此處下種者頗少，約佔總額百分之十五而已。二稻亦各此數，但收成則六七成至五成左右。其收割時期，頭稻約在大暑前後，二稻約秋分之後，三稻須九月左右。至於頭稻，收成較差者，由於夏間之亢旱以及收前之大風雨所致，如果風雨和亢旱兩者時間上能互相掉換一下，則頭稻必可豐收。好在此間晚稻（即三稻）較多，以近日之氣候而言，今年晚稻，實可望其豐收。]　　惟是賦稅一項，實足重困吾民，正稅而外，其無可命名之苛雜，以年計之，當數倍於正賦。且多爲不定期性質。一旦收取，即須繳付，設稍延宕，催索者踵接而至！　　周浦一瞥　　周浦的夜市，從前相當繁盛。華燈初上之際，這裹的一切夜市，如酒菜館·旅館·以及戲館等等，無不熟鬧非凡，直至午夜三四時不休，尤以博窟未禁絕時期爲最盛。但自行政督察專員公署成立，厲行禁令，夜市一落千丈。晚間防空，街頭絕無燈光，而劈拍之牌聲，則遠近相傳，旅館中並明定租牌費五元一具，蓋賭風仍盛也。　　周浦公園右旁有縣立第二中學及附上·小學人數，約在四百左右，中學僅一百二十餘人，私立中學，尚有時代和亞光兩所。教師的待遇，私立學校，似較縣立爲優。因私立學校，大都有所謂校董會者爲其支援，而縣立二中，所得縣府經當補助費，月僅七千元，教師八人，平均每人尚不足千元，對於學費之收取，大都以學米計算，縣立學校，每人約繳食米一斗五升，私立則略有增加。惟問亦有折價繳納者，其生活之清苦·槪可想見!　　南滙全縣，共有保安隊一大隊，分爲九個中隊，大隊長由縣長兼任，分駐於城廂及大團·新塲·周浦等重要市鎭，盟邦亦派有警備隊，共同維護治安。保安隊士兵僅僅支取三百多元一月的餉銀，加上檢問所充公的沒收統制品變賣部份的充賞在內，至多不過七百元左右，照目下的生活，怎能維持？　　治安是重要問題，而擔任治安的保安隊待遇如此菲薄，對於治安責任自成問題，而保安隊員生活又不可因此停頓，所以，調整待遇與維護治安，不能分離解決也。</p>

<h3>日用品統制會實行生產管理統制原料抑平市價</h3>
<p>目前皂燭火柴之原料，因來源缺乏，製造品生產日形減少，向來統制辦法，多對於製成品，至原料則多未實行統制，致價格日漲，無法抑止。日用品統制會有鑒於此，爲增加生產抑平價格起見，將對於皂燭火柴原料，加以管理。據悉該項計劃對於皂燭火柴之原料蒐買運輸分配以及製造等，將根據政府規定辦法，由該會集中人力財力統籌辦理，務期生產增加，且使製成品品質劃一，生產費節省，以滅低成本，抑平市價。再聞皂燭火柴之原料，有有爲舶來品，現在來源匱乏，該會正在運用科學方法，研究一種替代品，以資供給。</p>

        <h1>1944 - n262</h1>
<h3>Decisive Political Battle</h3>
<p>[To obtain certain victory, the first thing is to believe in certain victory. Without the belief in certain victory, obtaining certain victory is probably impossible in the world.] This is what the elder Mr. Tokutomi Sohō, a senior figure in the Japanese press, said in his book [Essential Reader for a Victorious Nation]. At this stage of the decisive battle concerning the survival of the Greater East Asian race, every participating nation should jointly believe in certain victory and firmly establish the belief in certain victory, in order to achieve certain victory and complete the task of the national liberation war. We are a member of the participating nations in the Greater East Asia War, so we naturally cannot be an exception.</p>
<p>However, firmly believing in certain victory is only half the guarantee of achieving it. At the same time, we need the practice of certain victory work even more. With belief but without the corresponding practical work, this belief will not be realized. Only with work and without a firm belief, when encountering environmental changes, the work is very easy to slack off, and it is equally difficult to complete the goal. Therefore, on the one hand, we must firmly believe in certain victory, and on the other hand, we must practice certain victory work, fully cooperating with the belief.</p>
<p>How do we practice certain victory work? In the current situation and environment, the most urgent thing is [Decisive Political Battle]—the refining of politics to meet the needs of a decisive battle. We proposed [On Certain Victory Politics] in our editorial on August 29, saying: [Good politics is a guarantee of obtaining certain victory]. Now we say [Decisive Political Battle] is not only the passive clarity of politics but also the active adaptation to the needs of a decisive battle.</p>
<p>To promote decisive political battle, the first thing is to firmly believe in certain victory because [certain victory] is our central belief today, and there is absolutely no room for hesitation or wavering. Secondly, we must have the spirit to dare to innovate. The decisive battle stage is so tense that we must not be satisfied with maintaining the status quo because maintaining the status quo today means retrogression tomorrow. For example, if we find bad phenomena in local politics, we must quickly and thoroughly reform them. If we are not quick, problems will accumulate over time and be difficult to reverse. If we are not thorough, then trivial efforts will be of no help. Also, if we find that a certain plan or facility work does not match the expected results or is even the opposite, and is not suitable for China's national conditions and popular sentiments, even if it is a suggestion from an allied country, we should immediately raise it and earnestly discuss reform, so that its consequences will not be detrimental to China's national economy and people's livelihood, and even more detrimental to the cooperation in the war. In short, at the current decisive stage, the only requirement for any facility is that it is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and even more beneficial to the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>In addition, the point of using people based on their talents is truly the only way to political progress, especially in decisive political battles. Zhuge Liang said in his Memorial on Dispatching the Army: [Drawing near virtuous ministers and keeping petty men at a distance was the reason why the Former Han prospered; drawing near petty men and keeping virtuous ministers at a distance was the reason why the Later Han declined.] Whether in ancient or modern times, in China or abroad, when talented people are used well, the politics are good; when inferior people are used, the politics are corrupt, without exception. This time, the National Government has made partial adjustments to central and local officials. We believe that this is only a job change and has nothing to do with using people based on their talents. We cannot help but wonder whether those who have not achieved results in politics in location A will have results after being transferred to location B? Those who have not achieved results in their official positions in location A will have results after being transferred to official positions in location B? For more than ten years, the changes in personnel in politics have always fallen into the rut of a revolving lantern. The people who are transferred back and forth are too familiar in the eyes of the people. We can't help but wonder: First, do these people have a belief in certain victory? Second, do they have the perseverance to take on decisive political battle? Third, do they have the spirit of hard work and practical work?</p>
<p>Finally, for the establishment of decisive political battle, we hope that the authorities will pay special attention to using people based on their talents, not only focusing on the transfer of central figures but also attracting truly talented people from the opposition, and ensuring that the right people are in the right jobs, so as to refresh the public's eyes and ears and achieve decisive political battle.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Skillfully Night Raids Enemy Fleet in Palau Area, Sinking and Destroying Fifty Boats and Fifteen Tanks</h3>
<p>Central News Agency from a Japanese base in the central Pacific, 21st dispatch. A part of the Japanese air force skillfully approached the enemy fleet gathered in the Palau area and bombed and destroyed a destroyer on the evening of the 18th. By the morning of the 18th, a total of 30 enemy boats had been sunk, and 20 enemy boats and 15 tanks had been destroyed.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st dispatch. According to a dispatch from a base in the central Pacific, the Japanese air force rushed to attack the enemy landing forces on Peleliu Island on the evening of the 18th, causing their positions to catch fire, and destroyed a large enemy transport ship near the Cosol Strait.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th dispatch. According to a dispatch from a base in the central Pacific, about 80 enemy planes attacked Palau Island on the 19th. From the 6th to the 14th, a total of about 1,680 enemy planes attacked the Palau area, about 1,320 attacked the Peleliu area, and about 500 attacked Yap, totaling about 3,500. The Japanese army shot down 107 planes, and 48 planes were severely damaged.</p>
<h3>Peleliu Japanese Troops Fight Hard and Repulse the Enemy</h3>
<p>Central News Agency from a base in the central Pacific, 21st dispatch. Enemy troops have landed on Peleliu Island, but the powerful force of about one division that they have deployed has been severely damaged by the fierce attack of the Japanese garrison. Therefore, after sweeping Peleliu Island, the enemy troops abandoned their attempt to invade Palau, but the enemy is still actively reinforcing. The Japanese side is continuing to engage in melee attacks against this superior enemy. On the afternoon of the 18th, the enemy, under the cover of naval gun fire, attempted to break through the southern part of the central highlands with dozens of tanks, but after being attacked by Japanese artillery, most of their tanks were destroyed. However, on the morning of the 19th, the enemy again attacked that area repeatedly with a large force, so the Japanese army engaged in fierce fighting with them. After three hours, the enemy was again severely damaged and collapsed. The enemy who attacked this time is now in a state of chaos, and their tanks have also suffered considerable damage. However, it is undeniable that the enemy's firepower is quantitatively overwhelming the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Central News Agency from a base in the central Pacific, 21st dispatch. The Japanese army on Peleliu Island is still guarding the area north of the island's airfield (i.e., the central highlands area), and is also responding to the fierce attacks of the artillery units, continuously night-raiding the enemy forces, inflicting heavy damage on their main force. Although the enemy army has repeatedly strengthened artillery fire and reinforced tanks in an attempt to penetrate the Japanese army's central highlands positions, they have not succeeded.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st dispatch. According to a dispatch from a Japanese base in the central Pacific, the Japanese army on Peleliu Island has been making a brave defense since the enemy landed, and has been adding melee attacks to the enemy forces at any time. From the time of the engagement on the 16th to the morning of the 19th, there have been as many as seven large-scale attacks, and the enemy forces have suffered a loss of 3,200 people. From the time the enemy forces attempted to land on Peleliu Island to the morning of the 19th, the losses suffered have actually reached more than 8,700. Therefore, the battle situation on the island is more tragic than that on Ōmiya Island and Saipan Island.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Fight Valiantly on Angaur Island</h3>
<p>Central News Agency from a base in the central Pacific, 21st dispatch. The enemy forces that landed on Angaur Island set up a bridgehead on the northeast end of the island on the 17th, and heavily shelled the Japanese army's positions on the 17th and 18th. However, the Japanese army still fought bravely. As of 7:00 p.m. on the 17th, the Japanese garrison had achieved the following results: ○ Sunk about 30 enemy boats and destroyed more than 20 boats. ○ Destroyed 15 tanks.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st dispatch. According to a dispatch from the central Pacific, the enemy forces landing on Angaur Island have suffered heavy losses due to repeated fierce attacks by the Japanese army. Therefore, they have gradually increased their forces. On the 19th, the enemy forces arrived at a location one kilometer away from a city in the central and western part of the island. The Japanese garrison immediately ambushed them near the lighthouse highlands, inflicting heavy damage on them and repelling them.</p>
<h3>Two American Planes Shot Down Near Zhaoqing</h3>
<p>Central News Agency from a Chinese front line base, 21st dispatch. Five US-Chongqing P-51 aircraft attacked the suburbs of the Japanese army's first-line troops west of Zhaoqing at around 10:00 a.m. on the 19th, and were shot down and destroyed by Japanese fighter planes.</p>
<h3>Japanese General Ugaki Visits Commander Okabe</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Beijing, 21st dispatch. Japanese General Ugaki visited Mr. Okabe, the supreme commander of the Japanese North China Area Army, on the 20th for cordial talks and attended a reception banquet.</p>
<h3>German and Soviet Troops Both Enter Finland</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st dispatch. German News Agency reports: The commander-in-chief of the German mountain troops announced this morning that the German troops in the far north theater have entered Finnish territory. Finland, which has been protected by the German army for three years, has become a decisive battleground. Since the Soviet army has crossed the Finnish border, this move by the German army is a strategic necessity. The Finnish side hoped that the great enemy of Europe would stop advancing at the Finnish border, but this hope has become a bubble, and the result is that the villages in Finland have become war zones. The German army cannot be held responsible for this unfortunate event because the Soviet-Finnish armistice negotiations have endangered Germany's security, and the German army should implement countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Hitler Goes to the Western Front to Personally Direct Operations</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 21st dispatch. The focus of the Western Front has shifted to the northern region, and the anti-Axis forces have concentrated air force units to launch an intense offensive and defensive war. The German army is resisting bravely, and the anti-Axis forces are having difficulty making progress. According to an Associated Press frontline dispatch, Chief Hitler has personally gone to the front line to direct the German army, which is firmly defending the area from the Dutch border to the Saar Valley. It seems that V-1 missiles will be used. On the 19th, the US army positions on the banks of the Maas River suffered great damage. According to Berlin intelligence, the German army launched a large-scale counterattack in the area south of Aachen. The US army advancing from Vogesel and from the Ping area toward Strasbourg was stopped. According to a United Press frontline dispatch, the US army in the Nancy-Metz area and the Belfort-Gep area is facing fierce resistance from the German army.</p>
<h3>Director Kurihara Discusses Favorable Progress of the War Situation</h3>
<p>The Importance of Air Combat is Also Increasing</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st dispatch. Navy Press Director Colonel Kurihara gave a lecture on the 20th evening at the Central Air Warfare Lecture Hall in Hibiya Public Hall here, titled [The Greater East Asia War and Airplanes], discussing the favorable progress of the war situation and the enrichment of aviation personnel. The main points are as follows: The main weapon in the Greater East Asia War is undoubtedly the airplane, because in this war, only the airplane has exerted the greatest effectiveness, and this is also a characteristic of this war. The activity of airplanes has the same effectiveness on land and sea, especially in naval battles. If air supremacy cannot be ensured, then sea supremacy will inevitably be lost, and the battle will fall into an unfavorable position. Today, the enemy's attacks are becoming more and more imminent on the Japanese mainland. As the battlefield gradually approaches the mainland, the importance of air combat is also increasing. At present, most of the Japanese airfields have been completely prepared, and the supply of military supplies and fuel necessary for air combat is becoming more favorable due to the shortening of the supply line. Due to the shortening of the battle line, the cooperation of the army and navy air forces is becoming increasingly close, and the number of pilots and crew members is also increasing. They are now being deployed in various air bases and mobile naval units, waiting for the maturation of the battle opportunity.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in South China Enters Yunfu City</h3>
<p>Vanguard Nine Miles from Guilin</p>
<p>Central News Agency from the South China Front, 21st dispatch. The powerful Japanese troops advancing westward along the south bank of the West River crossed the Xinxing River, a tributary of the West River, near Tongzhou at noon on the 17th and advanced about four kilometers. At dawn on the 19th, they surrounded Yunfu County, the stronghold of the Chongqing 158th Division. The right-wing troops of the Japanese army successively occupied Tongyouyuan, Chucheng, Dayuanchuan, Luosha and other places, and the left-wing troops also successively occupied Jumenzhen, Huanggang, Dashanjiao and other key points. Pressing on Yunfu from both sides, a vanguard unit had broken into Yunfu County at noon on the 19th, and then the various troops also rushed into the city and continued to pursue the Chongqing army that was fleeing westward. One part of them had reached an area ten kilometers southwest of Yunfu. According to reports, Yunfu County is garrisoned by the Chongqing 158th Division, with division commander Liu Dongcai and other officers, to guard the Zhaoqing area. However, under the fierce offensive of the Japanese army, about 1,200 Chongqing troops have begun to retreat since the 17th. According to aircraft reconnaissance, the Chongqing army is currently retreating in several places between Yunfu and Luoding.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 21st dispatch. The Japanese army advancing on Guilin in South China has approached the city, and the vanguard of the left-wing troops has also reached within nine miles of Guilin.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army's Attack on Hengyang and Guilin Creates Brilliant Achievements</h3>
<p>Spokesman Sanda's Speech</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch. Lieutenant Colonel Sanda, press director of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, who has been responsible for guiding news reporting and propaganda at a certain base on the front line since the Japanese army launched the Hunan operation, arrived in Shanghai on the 20th. Yesterday, he specially met with a group of reporters to explain in detail the achievements of this operation and the current war situation in the Guilin area. The main points of Mr. Sanda's speech are as follows: ○ Until the fall of Hengyang, due to the enemy's thorough destruction of transportation routes and the activity of the US-Chongqing air force, the Japanese army found it quite difficult to supply. At the same time, the officers and soldiers had no choice but to display the</p>
<h3>self-denying</h3>
<p>spirit of Kumen. Almost all of the enemy troops in Hengyang were from Hunan, so they resisted fiercely based on the concept of loving their homeland, which made the Japanese army's combat conditions unfavorable everywhere. Fortunately, although it was the hot season, there were no cases of illness in the army, and the officers and soldiers were able to do their best to create brilliant achievements. ○ The current offensive operation in the Guilin area is slightly smoother than the previous operation in Hengyang. The Japanese army is now continuing to</p>
<h3>rapidly advance.</h3>
<p>According to intelligence, Guilin is already extremely shaken, and the US-Chongqing air force has begun to destroy various facilities and retreat. From this, it can be understood that the enemy, especially the US-Chongqing air force, is becoming more and more active as the Japanese army penetrates deeper into southwestern China. At the same time, it is expected that monsters such as the American-style Chongqing army or the American ground army will appear in the future. The guiding spirit of the Japanese army in combat has always been to practice the original declaration. Although it is the Chongqing army, those who</p>
<h3>do not resist</h3>
<p>are not regarded as enemies, because the Japanese army's combat goal is to drive out the British and American enemies who are invading East Asia. The enemy's combat power in the Wenzhou operation is extremely weak, so the progress is very fast. ○ As mentioned above, it is assumed that the US military, in addition to the air force, will also have ground troops appearing on the mainland, this assumption, although it is merely a prediction, however we cannot afford to let our guard down. Regarding this kind of US ground troop support to Chongqing, the Chongqing Propaganda Minister Liang Han Cao</p>
<h3>expressed a welcome</h3>
<p>said that it was no less than a savior for China. However, we believe that the Chongqing side needs to deeply reflect on this issue. If the United States sends a large number of ground troops to the mainland and can win, causing Japan to retreat, will the United States really treat Chongqing as a friend at that time, allowing China to achieve glorious independence? The cunning British and Americans have been exploiting China for hundreds of years. One cannot believe that the Chongqing people have forgotten their hatred or are expressing gratitude. The British and Americans of a century ago attempted to turn China into a colony. To this day, their methods</p>
<h3>remain unchanged,</h3>
<p>gradually seizing control of some of the Chongqing authorities' leaders, and then plotting to dominate all of China. And today, their air force is even more unscrupulous, seizing the command of operations as its own. In fact, the enemy America has already regarded China as a colony. It is Britain and America who are destroying China's unification. It is Britain and America who are the common enemy of China and Japan. Looking at the European and Pacific war situations, the momentum of the American counteroffensive is becoming more and more intense. We should not allow the enemy to have room to encroach on the mainland, and further ensure a complete and solid posture, so that China can firmly defend itself as the China of East Asia.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Ministry Presents the Loyalty and Heroism of the Guards in La Meng and Tengchong</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st dispatch. The Japanese garrisons in La Meng and Tengchong have been fighting fiercely in the Myanmar area for a long time. During that time, they inflicted heavy damage on the Chongqing army in the Yunnan area, and their contribution to the overall operation of the Japanese army was also extremely great. Now, after fulfilling their mission, both garrisons have finally gloriously sacrificed their lives. This news was announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 20th. The great achievements of these two garrisons are truly enough to shock heaven and earth and move ghosts and gods. In the past, the supreme commander of the Japanese Southern Army and the supreme commander of the Japanese Army in Myanmar awarded them certificates to commend their merits and encourage them. After this glorious sacrifice, the Japanese Army Ministry also presented their glorious situation to the Japanese Emperor, and the Ministry issued an order as follows: Announcement of the Japanese Army Ministry on September 20, Showa 19 (1944): The great achievements of the Japanese garrisons in La Meng and Tengchong were previously awarded certificates of commendation by the supreme commander of the Southern Army and the supreme commander of the Japanese Army in Myanmar. Now, in view of the glorious sacrifice of these two garrisons, we hereby present their loyalty and heroism to the Emperor.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st dispatch. Since the Japanese army launched an offensive on Imphal, Britain and the United States have been deeply concerned that the defensive posture of the anti-Axis forces in East India will collapse. Therefore, they requested the Chongqing side to dispatch the Yunnan Expeditionary Force to attack from the front of the Nu River to threaten the Japanese rear, and at the same time attempted to open up the Ledo Road. In mid-May, sixteen divisions of the Chongqing army in the Yunnan area crossed the Nu River in force, forming a situation of confrontation with the Japanese army. Since then, the decisive battle on the Nu River front has begun. As a result, in the La Meng and Tengchong areas, the Japanese army finally gloriously sacrificed all of its members, but the initiative for the entire operation on the Nu River front is still in the hands of the Japanese army, and the Chongqing army's attempt to open up the Ledo Road has ultimately failed. The war situation in various places since the Chongqing army launched its counteroffensive until now is as follows:</p>
<h3>The Course of Battle in La Meng and Tengchong</h3>
<p>The La Meng garrison resisted the offensive of the Chongqing army with a very small force. From beginning to end, it has lasted for more than 100 days. On September 7, due to being outnumbered, the entire army gloriously sacrificed their lives. The attacking Chongqing army had six divisions under the command of the 11th Group Army, whose number was 60 times that of the Japanese garrison. The Japanese army in Tengchong, under the siege of five divisions of the Chongqing 20th Group Army, fought against them for a total of two months. During that time, they did not allow the 20-fold Chongqing army to invade an inch of land. Therefore, in the second half of the Chongqing army's siege, because it had no effect, they adopted the same tunneling tactics as in a fortress attack, that is, digging tunnels to the city walls. As a result, the city walls and gates were completely destroyed, and they invaded the city. After that, both sides engaged in a glorious bayonet battle and hand grenade battle. In the end, only a dozen Japanese soldiers were left, but they still fought bravely alone until the 14th, when they all died in battle. Jiang Jieshi was deeply moved and instructed the entire army, saying that although the Chongqing army on the Nu River front had excellent equipment and a large force, they still failed to make favorable progress in the attack and achieve the expected results. On the contrary, the Japanese armies in La Meng and Tengchong fought to the last man, still regarding death as homecoming and completing their mission. This is truly a lesson for our soldiers. In the future, the Chongqing army must take the spirit of the Japanese army's glorious struggle as a model.</p>
<p>The Japanese army in the Nengleng area fought for more than two months under the siege of several times the number of Chongqing troops. Then, the main force of the Japanese army gathered around Longling. On September 3, they launched an offensive inside and outside, and on the 10th, they finally lifted the siege. They then turned from the west side to encircle the six or seven divisions of the Chongqing army in the area, giving them a thorough blow and causing them to retreat eastward. The Japanese army is now steadily pressing on them.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Takes the Initiative on the Nu River Front</h3>
<p>Since mid-May, the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force has mobilized a large force of sixteen divisions to launch an offensive, but it has been blocked by the fierce fighting of the Japanese army. At present, the overall war situation on the Nu River is gradually becoming unfavorable to the Chongqing side. Britain and the United States originally had high expectations, but they were greatly disappointed. Recently, they even expressed dissatisfaction with Jiang Jieshi. In fact, Jiang Jieshi also despised the British and American supervisors, and even dispatched the secretly hidden 200th Division to the front line to change the war situation, but this was also defeated and fled east of Longling by the elite Japanese army near Longling. Thus, under the initiative of the Japanese army on the Nu River front, a new development is being seen, and the Chongqing side's attempt to break through the Ledo Road has ultimately failed. Since the Chongqing army began its offensive in mid-May until today, the damage inflicted on the Chongqing army by the various Japanese units, as announced by the Japanese General Headquarters, has totaled 73,000 people. By division, one division, the 39th Division, has been annihilated. Five divisions, the 76th, 28th, 87th and Honorary Divisions, and the 2nd Reserve Division have been routed and severely damaged (damage is more than two-thirds). Six divisions, the 198th, 116th, 3rd, 80th, 103rd and 88th Divisions, have been routed (damage is more than one-third). Four divisions, the 130th, 9th, 200th and Newly Formed 33rd Divisions, have suffered considerable damage. Only one of the Chongqing side's sixteen divisions has not suffered any damage.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Longling Expands War Results</h3>
<p>Central News Agency from a certain Japanese frontline base, 21st dispatch. Since the Japanese army in the Longling area lifted the siege of the Chongqing army, it has been rapidly progressing with a powerful posture and is currently encircling the Chongqing army, expanding its war results step by step. The war situation in that area has improved, which not only strikes the Ledo Road, but also has a great impact on other aspects. Next, with the Japanese army's securing of Longling, the Chongqing army's strategic line connecting Tengchong, Longling, and La Meng is each feeling isolated. In particular, in the Tengchong area, the five divisions of the Chongqing army have lost their rear supply route, and their strategic intention has failed. According to reports, the Chongqing army's current goal of invasion is to open up the Burma Road, so it has a plan to correspond to the progress of the North Burma front and move south into the interior of Myanmar, which should not be ignored. Therefore, the Chongqing army has focused its greatest strength on Longling, the road to recapturing the Ledo Road, gathering a large army composed of nine divisions in that area, and launching repeated counterattacks for more than two months. However, now with the launch of the new offensive by the Japanese army, not to mention the Yunnan-Burma Road, the opening of the Ledo Road is also facing a major crisis. Speaking of the equipment of the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force, it is mostly American-style and is the elite of the Chongqing army. However, since the start of the war, in more than four months, the bodies discarded alone have reached more than 30,000. Due to the great annihilation battle of the 11th Group Army near Longling, its casualties and losses will certainly increase even more.</p>
<h3>Trip to Nanhui</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Having returned from Qingpu and rested briefly, I set off again on a trip to Nanhui. Nanhui County is bordered by Chuansha to the north, Fengxian to the south, the East Sea to the east, and the Huangpu River to the west. The people are mostly simple and honest, with Puzhen being the center of transportation and commerce in the county, making it relatively prosperous, hence the nickname "Little Shanghai."</p>
<p>On the Shanghai-Nanhui Road</p>
<p>The route from Shanghai to Nanhui involves crossing the river from the Dongchang Dock at the 16th Bund, then purchasing a ticket at the Dongya Bus Station. The fare is 300 yuan, and the bus departs at 8:15 AM. Traveling south from Dongchang Road to the Zhangjiabang checkpoint, passengers are required to get off the bus for inspection. Further south, we reach Baiyunjing, where there is another checkpoint. Slightly south of that, the bus turns east and runs parallel to the railway (commonly known as the "small train") that travels between Zhoujiadu and Zhoupu Town. After passing the Sanlintang checkpoint, we encountered the train coming from Zhoupu. The speed at which it travels is even slower than Shanghai's trams. It is said that there are concerns about derailments, so travelers are willing to pay four times the price to take the bus, not only for convenience but also for safety. After traveling east for about an hour, we arrived in Zhoupu. Although the streets are not very wide, they are quite neat and the townscape is lively. I checked into the Zhoupu Hotel and, after resting briefly, went for a stroll in the nearby suburbs.</p>
<p>Rice Harvest</p>
<p>Traveling west from Zhoupu to Chuanjiazhai, a village where many people share the surname Chuan, I inquired about this year's harvest. It was said that: [The local rice crop is divided into two types: "early" and "late." The early rice that is harvested first is called "first rice," and the later harvested is called "second rice." The late rice is called "third rice." The yield of the first rice is over 90%, but the quantity is extremely small because it is not very resistant to waterlogging, so very few farmers plant it here, accounting for only about 15% of the total. The second rice is about the same, but the yield is around 50% to 70%. The harvesting period for the first rice is around the Major Heat solar term, the second rice is after the Autumn Equinox, and the third rice is around September. The poorer yield of the first rice is due to the severe drought in summer and the heavy wind and rain before harvest. If the wind and rain and the drought could be switched around in time, the first rice would surely have a bumper harvest. Fortunately, there is more late rice (i.e., third rice) here, and given the recent weather, a bumper harvest is expected this year.]</p>
<p>However, the tax burden is truly heavy on our people. In addition to the regular tax, the various kinds of arbitrary fees that cannot even be named, when totaled annually, are several times the amount of the regular tax. Moreover, they are mostly of an irregular nature. Once collected, they must be paid immediately. If there is even a slight delay, collectors will arrive one after another!</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Zhoupu</p>
<p>The night market in Zhoupu used to be quite prosperous. When the lights were lit, everything in the night market, such as restaurants, hotels, and theaters, was extraordinarily lively, continuing until 3 or 4 AM, especially when gambling dens were not yet prohibited. However, since the establishment of the Administrative Inspector's Office and the strict enforcement of prohibitions, the night market has plummeted. At night, due to air defense measures, there are no lights on the streets, but the sound of mahjong tiles being shuffled can be heard from afar. Hotels even explicitly charge five yuan per set for renting mahjong tiles, indicating that gambling is still rampant.</p>
<p>Next to Zhoupu Park is the County Second Middle School and its attached elementary school, with a total of about 400 students. The middle school has only over 120 students. There are also two private middle schools, Shidai and Yaguang. Teachers' salaries seem to be better in private schools than in the county school because private schools often have a board of directors to support them, while the County Second Middle School receives only 7,000 yuan in monthly subsidies from the county government. With eight teachers, that averages less than 1,000 yuan per person. Tuition is mostly calculated in terms of rice. At the county school, each person pays about 1.5 dou of rice, while private schools charge slightly more. However, some are allowed to pay in cash at a discounted rate. One can imagine how meager their lives must be!</p>
<p>Nanhui County as a whole has one large security team, divided into nine squadrons. The county magistrate concurrently serves as the team leader. They are stationed in the urban area and important towns such as Datuan, Xinchang, and Zhoupu. Allied forces have also sent a garrison to jointly maintain public order. The security team soldiers receive only a little over 300 yuan a month in salary, which, along with the rewards from the sale of confiscated controlled goods from the checkpoints, amounts to at most about 700 yuan. How can they make a living with the current cost of living?</p>
<p>Public order is an important issue, but the security team responsible for maintaining it receives such meager compensation. This naturally creates a problem for public order. At the same time, the lives of the security team members cannot be allowed to stagnate because of this. Therefore, adjusting salaries and maintaining public order must be solved together.</p>

<h3>Confiscated Hidden Rice to Be Appropriately Punished, with Confiscated Portions Under the Control of the Rice Allocation Committee</h3>
<p>The Municipal Commodity Allocation Office previously handled the registration of rice inventory. However, it was found that a considerable number of people failed to report or reported past the deadline. After a thorough investigation by the Economic Security Office, those who concealed their rice were deemed to have hidden it privately and were subject to punishment and seizure. In consideration of the hardships of the people, penalties were meted out according to the severity of the case, with some amounts being confiscated. It is understood that most of the cases have now been completed, and notices of punishment have been issued, indicating the quantity to be confiscated. If there are any doubts, a report can be submitted to the office within three days, otherwise the order will be enforced. The cases will be handed over to the Rice Allocation Committee for transport and distribution. However, the amount that is sealed and returned must not be used without authorization and must be unsealed by personnel from the office.</p>
<h3>Doubled Sugar Ration for Each Household, General Sale from Tomorrow, Buy Eight Ounces of Sugar with Ration Coupon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, considering the approach of the Mid-Autumn Festival, has had the fifteenth-period per capita sugar ration approved by the authorities to be increased to meet the needs, scheduled to begin general sales on September 23rd. The association has notified all retailers and households, with the following points: ○ All sugar retailers in each district (former First District, Nanshi, Zhabei, Zhabei Sixth District, Xuhua Lane, Longcao Town, City Center, Pudong South, Pudong North, etc.) will begin general sales on September 23rd. The validity period of the sugar purchase certificate is until October 2nd; it will be invalid after the deadline. ○ For the purchase certificates for Chinese residents in the former First District, the authorities have stipulated that the No. 18 comprehensive allocation coupon be used (same for boat dwellers, hut dwellers, and Indian residents). Each designated retailer should mark the number of the sugar coupon on its door. Each household can purchase sugar against the coupon number. For the convenience of households, the office has specially printed lists of addresses and coupon numbers of the retailers and distributed them to the stores. If a household is unsure of the address of the retailer for their coupon, they can inquire at any designated sugar retail store nearby, and the store must not refuse. ○ For households purchasing sugar in the districts formerly under the Food Bureau, use the No. 16 sugar purchase certificate issued by the former Food Bureau. ○ Each sugar purchase certificate entitles Chinese residents to purchase eight liang (ounces) of granulated or white sugar (same for boat dwellers, hut dwellers, and Indian residents) for 64 yuan in national currency, including the cost of the sugar purchase certificate. Retail surcharges are waived. Households must bring their own containers to purchase sugar; additional fees will be charged for packaging.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Cracks Down on Police Officers Clinging to Streetcars</h3>
<p>Since the number of streetcars running on each route in the city has decreased, passengers are crowded and often cannot board after waiting for a long time. However, some police personnel take advantage of their official positions to arbitrarily cling to the streetcars while they travel, which is quite inappropriate. The Municipal Police Headquarters has long issued orders to strictly crack down on this behavior. However, it has been found that over time, the regulations are being ignored and mutually disregarded. Mr. Guo Shaoyi of the headquarters' inspection body specifically ordered the chief inspectors of each district yesterday to instruct all inspectors to strictly crack down on and prohibit the aforementioned behavior in their respective jurisdictions.</p>
<h3>Rice Allocation Arrives in Shanghai, Distribution Implemented</h3>
<p>The Police Consumer Cooperative of the Municipal Police Bureau requested assistance from relevant authorities in procuring rice for allocation. After procuring over 3,800 dan of white rice from Wuhu, it has been transported to Shanghai and will be distributed beginning on the 21st of this month. Each person will receive eight sheng at a price of 376 yuan. Police officers and their families are entitled to the allocation.</p>
<h3>Local Indian Community Holds Celebration Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Free India Independence League held its monthly meeting yesterday (the 21st) at 4:00 PM at the Racecourse to celebrate the anniversary of the establishment of the Free India Government. Thousands of Indian residents from the city attended. The meeting began with a speech by Mr. Nanak Chuttar, the head of the branch, who encouraged the Indian residents of the city to strive for India's independence, freedom, and liberation. Captain Naren and Lieutenant Shu Xin then gave speeches. A collection was held at the end, totaling 97,000 yuan. Finally, a standing committee member reported that the Free India Government Bank had been established in Zhaonan Island on July 6th of this year. If Indian residents in the city wish to deposit money in the bank, they can entrust the branch to forward the deposits on their behalf.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Control Association Implements Production Management to Control Raw Materials and Suppress Market Prices</h3>
<p>Currently, due to the lack of sources of raw materials for soap, candles, and matches, the production of manufactured goods is decreasing daily. Past control measures have mostly been aimed at manufactured goods, while raw materials have often not been effectively controlled, causing prices to rise daily and making it impossible to suppress them. In view of this situation, the Daily Necessities Control Association will manage the raw materials for soap, candles, and matches to increase production and suppress prices. It is understood that the plan will concentrate manpower and financial resources to handle the purchase, transportation, distribution, and manufacturing of raw materials for soap, candles, and matches in a coordinated manner, according to government regulations, to ensure increased production, uniform quality of manufactured goods, and reduced production costs, thereby lowering costs and suppressing market prices. It is further heard that some of the raw materials for soap, candles, and matches were imported. Now that the sources are scarce, the association is using scientific methods to research a substitute to provide supplies.</p>
<h3>Special Rice Allocation Will Not Be Issued to Unregistered Schools</h3>
<p>Special allocation rice for teachers and staff is being actively handled by the Municipal Education Bureau in conjunction with the Commodity Allocation Office. It is understood that there are still a small number of primary and secondary schools in Shanghai that have not yet been registered. The Education Bureau now stipulates that all unregistered schools must complete registration procedures within one month, otherwise they will not be able to obtain allocation rice.</p>
<h3>Press Conference to Be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Department has scheduled a press conference for 10:00 AM tomorrow (the 23rd) at the Municipal Government Building on Jiangxi Road. At that time, Mr. Ye Xuesong, Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, will attend and answer various questions from the newspapers regarding public utilities.</p>
<h3>Western Shanghai Houses to Be Registered by Deadline</h3>
<p>With the approval of the Municipal Government, the Owners Not-in-Residence Land and Housing Management Committee of the city previously began conducting a housing survey and registration in the western Shanghai area, starting in September and ending at the end of November. The scope of the survey is temporarily limited to the jurisdictions of the Changning Road, Huashan Road, and Xujiahui police substations. The survey work has been ordered by the Municipal Government to be assisted by the relevant bureaus. All homeowners in the area must bring their property ownership documents to the West Shanghai Office of the Committee at 1258 Yuyuan Road to apply for registration within the deadline. Failure to do so will be deemed as non-residence, and takeover will be enforced in accordance with the law. Furthermore, those currently occupying ownerless houses in the area must apply to the office for rental procedures before the end of October. Otherwise, once discovered or reported, in addition to being ordered to move out, they will be fined ten months' rent at the current rental price, with 50% of the fine being awarded to the informant as a reward.</p>
<h3>Exemption of Embroidery Products from Luxury Goods Tax Not Approved by Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously resolved at a members' meeting to request that embroidery products be taxed at 4% and exempted from being listed as luxury goods in order to maintain the livelihood of embroidery workers. The Ministry of Finance has now issued a response stating that since embroidery products are not daily necessities for the people, the consumption tax rate that should be levied has already been approved and promulgated by the Ministry. The request should not be considered.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Epidemic Prevention Injections Ends This Month, Epidemic Prevention Committee Holds Six Meetings</h3>
<p>The sixth meeting of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee was held on the 20th of this month. Those attending included Vice Chairman Yuan Junchang, Standing Committee members Chen Yidao, Chen Yeqin, Rao Youji, Counselor Nagai, Major General Shibata Toshio, Technician Matsuba, Director Tashiro, Major Motoyama Shigeo, Lieutenant Colonel Onodera Yoshio, and others. Chairman Yuan Junchang first reported the number of people receiving the second phase of cholera prevention injections. From August 1st to September 19th, a total of 1,685,763 people were injected. He also stated that since the committee implemented cholera prevention injections on May 1st, the first phase ended at the end of July, and the second phase began on August 1st. So far, there have been no confirmed cases of cholera. Based on past experience, the weather will become cooler, and there is unlikely to be any further outbreak. However, in order to be cautious and to ensure the peace of mind of the citizens of the city, the committee plans to end the third phase of mandatory injections by the end of this month. It has ordered epidemic prevention personnel to strengthen their work to ensure that citizens receive a second injection before the end. Standing Committee member Matsuba then reported that he had received a telegram from Ambassador Sawazawa in North China stating that people from Central and South China who wish to travel to North China must carry a cholera prevention certificate valid for three months. Checks will be carried out at Pukou and Xuzhou. Those who do not carry a certificate will not be allowed to pass. He urged the citizens of the city who wish to travel to North China to pay close attention, otherwise they may encounter difficulties along the way. The chairman then reported that a type of Shanghai disease (Dengue Fever) has recently been prevalent in the city. The occurrence of this disease is mostly due to mosquito bites. Although the disease is not very serious, it is easily transmitted and can cause other complications. The Health Bureau is currently making every effort to step up mosquito eradication work and hopes that the public will actively kill mosquitoes and avoid frequenting public places to prevent transmission.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Authorities Organize Air Defense Training Class</h3>
<p>In order to actively cultivate air defense cadres, the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters and the Police Bureau's Baojia and Police Defense Sections are jointly organizing an air defense training class. The three authorities plan to nominate internal leaders, hire teachers, and stipulate training subjects. Once the training venue is selected, outstanding members of the self-defense corps and police officers selected by the Police Bureau will be mixed and organized. After completing the training, they will be trained into strong cadres.</p>
<h3>Hongen and Public Relief Hospitals Admit Chinese for Treatment</h3>
<p>The Hongen Hospital on Chang'an Road (formerly Avenue Haig) in the city, during the era of the former Municipal Council, admitted Chinese patients to the first and second class wards, but its third class ordinary wards did not admit Chinese patients. After the recovery of the concessions last year, the hospital's board of directors was reorganized. The Municipal Health Authorities recently stated that the fees for the third class ordinary wards of the hospital are not too expensive. At a time when medicine is in short supply, it is necessary to open the wards to admit Chinese patients. Therefore, from today onwards, the third class wards will be opened as much as possible to accommodate Chinese patients. Furthermore, the Public Relief Hospital on North Suzhou Road is of similar nature and scale to Hongen Hospital and has free venereal disease and lung disease departments. In the past, it was only limited to foreign patients, but since the reorganization, it has widely accepted Chinese patients, and free treatment is provided equally to Chinese and foreign patients. It is hoped that patients among the citizens can contact these two hospitals, and they will be accommodated and treated as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Integrity and Honesty, Remuneration Used to Support Education</h3>
<p>At a time when the world is deteriorating, people's hearts are not as they used to be, and there are many dark secrets in all levels of society, it is admirable to find that the head of a certain institution has high ideals and does not take ill-gotten gains. Reading the letter from Mr. Wu Zhongyin, we can get a glimpse of the situation. The letter says: [Sir, I am enclosing a check for 20,000 yuan as a scholarship fund for your newspaper. The source of the funds is worth mentioning. A friend recently entrusted me to provide a certain convenience to the head of a certain institution in a certain matter and handed over a bank draft for 20,000 yuan as a token of gratitude to the head of the institution. However, Mr. So-and-so, the head of the institution, handled the matter impartially. Anything that was not outside the scope of the rules could be handled in accordance with the regulations. He refused to accept any undue reward. Mr. So-and-so's integrity and self-respect are truly admirable and inspire unlimited respect in this era of declining political morality. I am using this money to do good deeds to thank Mr. So-and-so for his integrity, which I think readers will also be happy to hear about.]</p>

<h3>The Educational Characteristics of the Former Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Children's Schools ○</h3>
<p>— Ueno Taichu</p>
<p>Ugly. Stipulating a fixed amount for daily hospitalization fees.</p>
<p>Yin. Stipulating necessary surgery fees.</p>
<p>Mao. Stipulating fixed amounts for medical expenses for family members (wife and children), maternity allowances for wives, or stipulating special nursing fees and medical consultation fees, etc. - limited to those with employment certificates. The above fees, except for medical consultation fees, which are paid twice a year to the doctor designated by the employee, are not paid on a regular basis. Payment is only made after application and approval when necessary.</p>
<p>(Various benefits other than salary and various allowances, etc., have been proportionally increased since the Incident based on the Municipal Council's Statistics Section's cost of living index - see monthly bulletin)</p>
<p>Fifth, Free Vaccination and Injections for Employees</p>
<p>In addition to annual smallpox vaccinations and anti-rabies injections, teachers and staff must receive a typhoid fever vaccination (three injections over three consecutive weeks) from the Health Department every three years. This vaccination is compulsory and is usually given free of charge by doctors visiting the school.</p>
<p>Sixth, Free Hiring of Substitute Teachers</p>
<p>If a teacher or staff member takes sick leave and provides documentation from hospitals such as Tongren, Renji, or the Red Cross, the school can hire a substitute teacher, with the substitute's fees being fully covered by the Municipal Council. The person taking sick leave also continues to receive their original salary. There was a female teacher who suffered from tuberculosis and took a year of sick leave, and her illness and recovery did not affect her job in any way. This is rare in schools in China.</p>
<p>Seventh, Many Opportunities for Further Study</p>
<p>This is not very obvious in middle schools, but primary school teachers and staff, under the guidance of Chinese educators, have made considerable achievements, such as:</p>
<p>A. Assigning teachers and staff holiday assignments and research topics.</p>
<p>B. Holding holiday lectures and subject-specific seminars for teachers and staff.</p>
<p>C. Demonstration and discussion sessions on teaching methods for each subject.</p>
<p>D. Collaboratively compiling and publishing natural science, French conversation, and kindergarten textbooks.</p>
<p>E. The writing of the Elementary School Teacher Magazine was mostly done by the teachers and staff of each school, which was very popular for a time.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the Students</p>
<p>Due to various traditional reasons, most people in Shanghai send their children to take the entrance exams for the Municipal Council schools every semester, creating a problem of too few seats and too many applicants. The general characteristics are:</p>
<p>○ Student Selection Situation</p>
<p>Whether it is middle school or elementary school, the new student exams every year cause great difficulty. One week before the end of each semester, the director of the Municipal Council announces the exam dates and registration procedures for each school. As a result, students flock to apply, and no fees are charged. The exam date is set for the day after the end of the semester (usually July 1st and December 17th). On average, the number of admitted students accounts for about one-fifth of the total number of applicants. Sometimes, registration has to be limited. It is remembered that at a certain school registration, children had a dispute over application forms. At that time, there was no queuing system, and the chaotic situation can be imagined. Also, the parents of students at a certain school waited outside the school from midnight to get application forms, which shows the eagerness for their children to enter the school. Under this kind of strict selection situation, the quality of students is not a big problem.</p>
<p>○ General School Spirit</p>
<p>Whether it is a boys' school or a girls' school, the students can be described as pure. Although the Chinese Children's Middle School has a slight tendency to study by rote and hold on to books, it does not fall into shadow and dullness. Elementary schools emphasize health and service and have the slogan "Personality First, Health First," which seems to be more lively. Girls' middle schools are especially able to avoid the current extravagant habits. It is remembered that Principal Liang of the Girls' Middle School gave a speech to the students at a farewell meeting, hoping that the students would always preserve the school's spirit, namely:</p>
<p>○ Simplicity, not being flashy, not dressing up.</p>
<p>○ Sincerity, not hypocrisy, not lying.</p>
<p>○ Teachers and students being close, living together, and never knowing what a riot is.</p>
<p>The above three points are ensured by facts, so they are specifically mentioned.</p>
