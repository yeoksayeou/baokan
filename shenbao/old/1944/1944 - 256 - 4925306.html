<h3>小學教育的當前問題</h3>
<p>小學教育是國民教育的基礎，也就是決定國家民族前途的基本事業。只有小學教育辦得好，其他中學大學專科教育，才容易發展，才容易收效。二十世紀以來，日本·德國的小學教育，辦得最好；現在爲他們自己的祖國獻身服務而爭取民族光榮的，都是十年二十年前的小學生們！回顧我國，自清末開始新教育以來，對於國民基礎教育雖亦熱烈提倡，但因政局演變，成效不彰。爲着未來國家社會的中堅人才計，對於今日的小學教育，我們實在不能不痛下決心，痛下苦心，樹立良好的基礎。本報這次繼大中教育兩次座談會後繼續舉行小學教育座談會的主旨，亦在乎此，希望藉以引起教育當局和民間教育界的特別注意與奮勉前進！（座談會紀錄見今日本報第三版）　　我國小學教育的當前問題，可說是太多了，從制度，內容，方法，一直到教材問題，眞是千頭萬緒，也決不是一二次座談會一兩篇論文所能解決得了的。不過在此時此地最表現得嚴重和可能討論，可能解決，並且必須先行解決的，則有下列幾個問題：　　第一，改善教職員生活，尤其是改善小學教師生活問題，本報一再呼籲。可惜我們的力量太少，除了舉辦教職員補助金醫藥補助金之外，還沒有特別可以告慰的成就。我們今天所期望於各方面的是：○希望當局於食米特種配給以外，加配日用必需品，及採取其他特質上優待小學教員的辦法。○希望社會各界如醫藥，交通，文化，娛樂各方面，予教職員以特別優待；○希望比較富裕的學生家長大量捐輸，辦理有助於改善教職員生活的事業，如教職員家屬生產貸金等；○希望各學校當局實現經濟公開，改善教職員待遇，最主要的是增加薪金和供給合理的膳宿，對於教職員子女就學槪免一切費用。教育當局對於私立學校，除具有優良歷史者外，就管理其經濟以防止校長獨自支配。目前規模較大之學校（指大中小學而言），一學期收費一二百萬元者不在少數，尤須防止校長利用金錢投機行爲。　　第二，關於加強推進助學運動，搶救失學問題，爲了針對此時此地的現實，尚有待於各方面協力！我們今日最迫切的希望是：○社會上比較殷富的家庭，多多大量捐輸；共同搶救失學。○各學校應儘可能多設免費學額，最好每一個校長能以自我倡導的精神，以免費學額最多爲最大的光榮。○各學校與助學金機關加強連絡與合作，共謀助學運動事務上枝術上的改善，如這次小教座談會所決定的甄別標準，審查辦法等都很重要·○接受助金的中高大學生亦宜於特別奮勉以外，儘可能地參加協助推進助學金運動如調查，宣傳，以及其他事務等。　　第三，是小教師資問題：我們始終認爲這是當前小學教育最嚴重的問題，改善小學教師物質生活，問題還只解決了一半，進一步尚有求於師資的數量增加和素質提高。在這裹，我們一面希望當局多多致力於師範教育之改進與發展，一面仍盼現在從事小學教育的諸君，努力以下幾點：○充實自己戰錙上的學問與知識，力謀增強效率；○充實自已社會上的學識，主要是對於時事社會和政治，要有正確的認識；沒有正確和豐富的現實學識，是教不出學而有用的學生來的；○推進集體進修運動，首先組織小學教師進修會等等。我們得鄭重指出，教死書死教書，對於國家民族和社會是有害無利的！　　我們上面所叙述的，當然就整個教育而言。而上海爲全國教育的中心，所負教育上的使命，尤爲艱鉅。我們試加檢討近年本市教育行政，不必諱言的，太覺覺寂消極了，最大的缺點是與民間教育界未能密切聯繫，同時教育經費數額太少，過去第一區僅佔全部行政經費的百分之九，市政府教育費的比率更小。這在小學教師座談會中亦已特別提供意見。　　本市新任教育局長戴英夫氏現已視事，戴氏富於教育行政經騐，且勇於任事，必能重視本市教育使命，刷新教育行政。惟是巧婦難爲無米之炊，首先必須增加教育經費，始能實現理想計劃。歸納言之，今日我們所希望於當局者：○安定教員生活。○搶救失學。○管理私立學校，經濟公開。○取締不良學校，因爲不良學校之害，實甚於不設學校，我們認爲治安，民生，教育是目前上海的三大問題，亟待當局與民間共同努力以求解決。</p>
<h3>決心保衛大東亞謀戰局最後勝利日首相滿總理昨交換廣播</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日本少磯首相及滿洲張國務總理，十五日下午七時舉行交換廣播，日首相披瀝保衛大東亞之決心，謂將緊握時機，轉取攻勢，以謀戰局之最後勝利。滿張國務總理則就日本對滿政策之不變，深表謝意，謂滿洲國民四千五百萬，誓與日本團結一致，共同擊滅敵人。又本年滿洲豈收，日滿食糧問題，亦可迎刃而決云云，茲分誌其要旨如次：</p>
<h3>日首相致詞</h3>
<p>貴國建國時，帝國率先承認，迄今十有二載，其間，帮助跺國整理國內之各種制度，確保治安，充實內政，且又撤廢治外法權，設定日滿共同防衛等各項措置，使跺國國基愈臻鞏固。另一方面，在國防地位上，與日本始終維持二位一體關係，實不待言，與大東亞諸國以至歐洲有力諸國，次第敦睦外交，一躍而爲獨立完整之國家，甚可廣賀。目下，大東亞戰爭已三年半餘，敵人恣意侵略東亞，更變本加厲，日帝國決把握時機，採取攻勢，以獲最後之勝利，對外則堅定外交方針，發揮大東亞共同宣言之精神，貴國則舉物心兩面實力，對日本全面協力，尤於軍需物資食糧等之對日供給貢獻至大，日本一億國民感謝莫名。處此緊迫之決戰階段下，大東亞共榮圈各國各民族，當面對復興大東亞之共同目標緊密團結，發揮總力，如是始可獲取勝利，擊滅敵人。此次戰爭，爲亞細亞十億人之決戰，貴國早有深刻之認識，故必能與日本作成東亞共榮圈之核心，鞏固勝利，勇猛努力，以建立萬邦共榮之道義東亞。滿洲國諸君，決戰時期日迫，務須與日本同心同德，向擊滅敵人英美之途邁進。</p>
<h3>張總理致詞</h3>
<p>日本承認我國已十有二年，其間日本嘗致力克服一切困苦亞劣之條件，予我國建設以至重且大之援助。同時，由於我國官民之一致努力，滿洲國還得積儲不遜於先進諸國之確固國力，當此大東亞戰爭益加激烈，大東亞前途愈趨困難之際，在政治上，負有建設大東亞使命之滿洲國，實痛感任重道遠，責無旁貸，今日吾人報答盟邦多年情誼之道，唯有舉旣經充實之國力，以與日本並肩完成大東亞戰爭，使命之重要，實無過於今日。敵國皇帝階下，會於八月三十一日特召見本官及武部總務長官致訓，並訓諭滿洲國民謂：日本之興隆，即爲滿洲之興隆，日本之滅亡，即爲滿洲之滅亡，而日滿之興亡，亦即整個東亞之興亡，爾等此時尤應認識此點，盡其一切之手段，集中於完遂聖戰之一途。同時，並將內幣捐贈日軍當局，以爲生產飛機，協助前綫作戰之用。皇帝陛下此種措置之深遠，實爲吾人所不勝感謝者，吾等千五百萬國民，對於上項聖旨，尤應身體力行，致力於增強戰力，擊滅英美，以安聖慰於萬一。今日滿洲國當局正積極籌集戰費，以增強戰力，擊滅英美，滿洲國國民，亦正傾注心血，致力於戰爭之完遂。至於本年度之農作物，亦將有建國以來空前未有之豐收，故日滿之食糧問題，正未感任何不安，而大東亞食糧基地應有之使命，亦將由此得以完成。此外，滿洲國各鑛山及各工塲，亦在展開積極增產，擊滅英美之大運動，如上所述，官民一體之雄姿，實爲滿洲今日之姿態，當此意義深長之紀念日，深盼我國民一新其決意，以與日本一心一德爲擊滅英美而努力。</p>
<h3>紀念慶祝會</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　十五日爲日本承認滿洲國十二週年紀念日，日滿中央協會特於帝國飯店主辦承認滿洲國紀念慶祝會，參加者有重光大東亞相，滿洲國王駐日大使並日本方面緒方情報局總裁，二宮文相，松坂法相等各大將及其他各關係代表等多人。開會後由該協議會會長宮田光雄氏致開會辭，後爲重光大東亞相，王大使致敵及緒方情報局總裁演講，至二時散會。又滿駐日大使王允卿發表談話，大意謂：日本興亡即滿洲國之興亡，亦即大東亞全體之興亡，滿洲刻正舉全力增產食糧，決意奮起爭取大東亞戰爭之勝利。</p>
<h3>怒江兩岸日軍取夾攻態勢</h3>
<p>龍陵攻防戰益加激烈　　怒江前綫十五日中央社電　渝雲南遠征軍爲奪回滇緬公路，會大舉反攻，然由日軍之勇戰，與日軍對後方基地之猛擾，故其戰意日逐低下，自去秋以來，僅能向怒江西岸潛入攻擊兵一師，去年則陸續派大批軍隊渡過怒江，五月中旬更派來第十一，第二十兩集團軍所屬十五萬大軍，於騰越，龍陵，拉孟一帶，雙方展開激戰，並在騰越傾注主力第二十集團軍，日軍對其亦繼續增援新銳，到處擊潰渝軍。又龍陵之渝軍，除舊有之數師外，尚調來他處兵力，企圖奪回滇緬公路要衝之龍陵。據稱，衛立煌已受命死守現在陣地，日軍之新銳增援部隊，南自小松山一帶，西北自待勇山，勳山逐次奪取渝軍據點，將之迫至龍陵東方，緬甸方面日軍航空部隊，亦互相協力，故對渝軍事壓力漸次增大。　　怒江最前綫某基地十五日中央社電　龍陵方面日軍，刻在日機大編隊協力下，對龍陵附近渝第十一集團軍展開殲滅戰，反之，渝軍則自各地轉用救援部隊，力謀增強戰力，企圖頑強奪回龍陵，屢次實行反攻，日軍即隨處將之擊滅，使陷於混亂狀態。某日，渡過龍陵河之日軍有力部隊，衝擊渝軍側面，驅逐昂龍山之渝軍，即進至怒江畔北方某地，一方與此相呼應之日別動部隊，亦攻至怒江畔南方高地，由南北兩方面對該高地附近之渝軍取夾攻態勢，現正以龍陵爲中心，展開南北呼應之大包圍殲滅戰，渝暫編第三十九師之第一綫戰門兵力，刻已自一個師團減至一個中隊之程序，渝軍遭此重創，已有全面動搖之兆。</p>
<h3>太平洋空襲頻繁擊落敵機十餘架</h3>
<p>西南太平洋基地十四日中央社電　哈爾馬黑拉島加馬灣方面，十二日白晝敵戰門機轟炸機連合編隊，累計約九十架來襲，日軍當擊落其八架。又　宕蘭島布拉方面，有敵小型機累計七十架來襲，被擊落一架，又是日棉蘭方面Ｂ２４型機爲主幹之敵機五十架來襲，當地日軍部隊擊落其四架，新幾內亞之巴波方面，有Ｂ２５型機四十架來襲，各方面日方損害皆極輕微。　　東京十五日中央社電　八月份內統計，大東亞全戰域來襲之敵機，共約二萬八千六百架，反之，日機隊及陸上制空部隊，於進攻及迎戰中所獲戰果，共擊落美機二百九十四架，擊毀五百二十二架，共計八百十六架，</p>
<h3>山本大使談話</h3>
<p>盤谷十五日中央社電　日新任駐泰國大使山本熊一氏，發表談話稱，日本之根本國策，爲保衛東亞與解放東亞各民族，因此，日本政府決支援泰國獨立繁榮，故不因內閣之改組及大使之更迭而變更一貫之方針。</p>
<h3>日內閣通過發行新公債</h3>

<h3>塚原中將任橫須賀長官</h3>
<p>戶塚中將任航空本部長　　東京十五日中央社電　日海軍省十五日下午四時三十分發表：○海軍中將塚原二四三，補橫須賀鎭守府司令長官，此令，前任海軍大將野村直邦免職，另有任用。○海軍中將戶塚通太郎，補海軍航空本部長，此令。按新任橫須賀鎭守府司令長官塚原中將，新任海軍航空本部長戶塚中將，均爲盡瘁於　成日海軍航空部隊者，大東亞戰爭勃發後，即任艦隊司令長官，活躍於第一綫，發揮其軍事幹才，此次人事調整，實表明日海軍於太平洋從事空國決戰之決心，其今後之活躍，殊堪斯待。</p>
<h3>奎貝克會議英美企圖失敗</h3>
<p>松島部長發表談話　　日駐華艦隊報道部，昨（十五）日特例會見滬市中國新聞記者，由松島報道部長，就最近反軸心所舉行之奎貝克會議，蘇聯拒絕參加，反證英美蘇間之芥蒂業生，同時對渝蔣獻娼依賴外力，爲英美榨取中國資源，值得引人嚴重注視各點，闡述綦詳。</p>
<h3>蘇聯拒絕出席會議</h3>
<p>松島部長首謂：關於反軸心最近舉行之奎貝克會議，所透視之目的，在於太平洋及歐洲問題，美大總統秘書所披露會議內容，竟稱爲發揮太平洋與歐洲之英美聊合軍作戰之能力問題。查英美此次會議，冀望蘇聯參加，然史太林竟稱缺席，頓使英美之企圖失敗，在彼之談話內，更誑稱蘇聯與英美採取同一步驟，是實爲單戀之推想。</p>
<h3>渝方企圖仰仗外力</h3>
<p>其次爲渝蔣與哈萊之軍事會談，內容猶未見發表，同時本月十四日渝蔣與納爾遜之經濟會談，宋子文亦參與其間，查該二人之訪渝目的，一爲重慶繼續[抗戰]之會議，一則商討戰後開發問題。故哈萊等訪渝，殊可特別重視，即如渝政權之仰賴外力，以利其[抗戰]外，並在戰後亦需賴外力，從事開發建設，故我人應嚴重注視。尤其最近最顯著者，爲依外仗內之趨向，例如昨（十四）日渝方宣傳德國之全面和平，當地股票市塲影響至巨。部長旋謂：本人所深感今後本身後備力量，如須仰賴外力之危機，則國內民生，更影響非淺，此項問題應特別注意及研究。</p>
<h3>東亞戰勝具有信心</h3>
<p>如欲本身自救，須靠自己力量。雖目下歐洲戰局呈堅張局面，但我人決不因歐戰而影響大東亞戰爭，我人對完遂大東亞戰爭勝利，具有確定信念。關於中國問題，查中國地大物博，資源豐富，過去深遭英美多方榨取結果，所有資源頗少爲中國人民所享受，我人爲打破榨取弱小民族，乃發動大東亞正義戰爭，然而渝方不惜獻媚借賴外力作戰，且擬在戰後亦依賴外力開發，是項舉動，爲我盟邦日本所特別開心者。最近中國青年們，認識救中國之理念，必須中國本身之力量，及與盟邦日本之協助，以挽救中國於危　。同時日本之行動，誠當力謀全面之和平，並謀取中國人之幸福。</p>

<h3>布根台閘門戰事進入新階段</h3>
<p>亞琛城爭奪戰進行中　　布根台閘門十五日中央社電　海通社訊：反軸心軍之進攻布根台閘門，恐將造成與卡西諾類似之戰情，自地理上言，佛日山脈與瑞士汝拉山間之谷口，與養大利之卡西諾殊爲近似，今扼守該地之德軍，與今春扼守卡西諾之德軍具有同樣抵抗決心。此次進攻布根台之反軸心軍中，不乏會在卡西諾作戰者，貝爾福區美第七軍之作戰，顯然業已步入新階段，現戰事愈演愈烈。南翼之戰在多數地區已演成猛烈之塹壕戰，美第六軍團之突然折向北進，擬自雜蘇爾進撲貝爾福，可見其原來進軍計劃之失敗。　　柏林十五日中央社電　德國社軍訊：西綫戰事之重心，再度在於瑪斯特里治與亞琛城東南某一據點之間，該處現正在進行　戰，以爭奪西綫鐵壁之前哨陣地。</p>

<p>最近提到了旅行，恐怕任何人總感到有些頭痛吧！譬如說，車標沒有辦法購買，沿途除了擁擠之外，還處處受到種種的麻煩，這已是無法否認的事實。上海到北京的車票，頭等票價，二千八百五十元，如與黑市相比，恐較二等的還要便宜一半哩！然而除了黑市買票充斥之外，經過了最近華中鐵道當局的整頓，上海北站上車秩序已見良好，舉凡從前種紊亂與敲榨情形，顯見減少。由此以觀，過去上海輿論界對交通改良的建議，並非白費口舌，同時也明證盟邦協力的決心。　　從上海到南京，只有六小時就到達，我們那一天的火車也沒有誤時，下午二時三十分准時而抵下開車站，因了時間的充分，我們就沒有在南京躭擱，立即渡過江去直向浦口車站而去。可是在那裹却是情形不同了，不但秩序紊亂，同時也只見中儲劵百元劵的橫飛，使我們深感到貨幣跌價的實情。幸而記者同行的一位旅客是有特別的護送，總算沒有被波及，但是有一位同行的因爲他在人頭擁擠中漏落的緣故，卻被敲去了中儲劵五千元。事實是這樣的，他是一位有專於化學工業的人，在上海帶了些西藥的樣品想到天津去試騐製造的，不料到了浦口車站被檢查者以[西藥]爲名，要他五千元的罰款。他說，這是樣品並不值錢，你儘可拿去充公·可是那位檢查者卻搖搖頭，並不要充公，就以[帶局]的留難，終於使那位朋友爲了趕火車的關係，忍氣吞聲地犧牲了五千元。還有一位在北京大學當教授的，因了所携行李太多之故，也受罰款，計自下關到浦口，沿途以鈔票過關，一共也化去了四五千元。我們看了這些事實，不禁也爲之寒心！有人把它統計，這些檢查者，每次火車上下，他們總共可以敲到一百萬元的可驚數字。</p>
<h3>車僮氣燄凌人</h3>
<p>我們因爲有了特別護送，所以很早就走上津清綫車子。可是在我們上車時，在車上早就有許多旅客，尤其二等座位業已擁擠不堪，後來我們問問他們，才知道付了一筆類似買路錢的鉅款而取到這樣特權的。我們走上頭等車廂卻寂無一人，可是每一座位上都用粉筆寫着[大使館御指定]的字樣。我們沒法，就走到另一節車廂去，那裹是二等，可是有半節車廂也用粉筆寫着[一等車代用]，同時更見車僮大起忙頭，一面把二等客人趕走，一面更有老於旅行的人，就同他們在講斤頭。我們就在這個當口因有一等車票在手就毫無麻煩地坐下了。等到車子開行以後，我們才知道道所謂[一等車代用]，原是一種過門，所謂錢能通神的情形，在那裹更使你能夠完全瞭解其意義。等到火車快近徐州的時候，這批大腹便便的車僮們一面趕快把[一等代用]的粉筆抹去，一面就喜氣洋溢打算如何消磨此一良宵了！　　講到車僮，這不過火車上的僕役，可是在津浦綫上（指在濟南以南）卻特別具有權威。他可以用一些巧妙的法門，使一位頭等旅客沒有座位，也可以使一位二等旅客和頭等旅客同樣感到舒適。我們簡直難以想像，經過了八年的戰爭，在火車上服務的孩子，他們的道德竟墮落到如此的地步！而且他們自以爲有後台可靠，對一般旅客完全不以[人]的資格相待，好像世界上只有車僮是權威者！對於比較老實或貧窮的旅客，更是呵斥與　打立至。這些實情是記者此次親眼目額的事實，希望從浦口至濟南一段的鐵道當局加倍留意，因爲這種事實乃妨碍中日國民感情的尤者！我現在舉出一個例來：在九月五日的午夜後，當車子自徐州開行後，我們因了車僮把[一等車代用]的粉筆抹去了，才大胆地走進眞正的一等去。大槪在一小時以後，車廂中忽然起着糾紛，原來一位兇惡無比的車僮，正在指手劃腳地在趕走一位國府南京憲兵司令部的上校軍官。原因是爲了在臨城有一位盟邦的聯隊長上來，所以想把那位上校軍官所據有的座位事先讓出來。可是全部一等車廂大都坐滿了旅客，他們三個人沒有地方可讓，就此爭吵起來。那位兇惡無比的車僮，不僅態度傲慢抑且毫無人的氣息，後來雖然列車長來解說，但是車僮還是指鹿爲馬，不肯讓步。我們明明聽列車長說，因爲前面有二位盟邦軍官上來，所以請他們讓兩個座位出來，不料車僮卻漸要硬假狐威他們全部四個座位統統讓出。因此事勢幾乎弄僵，因爲那位軍官不懂日語列車長也不懂華語，所以只好由車僮在中間搬弄是非。後來我們看看實在再也忍不下氣，乃請一位深通日語的友人起而干涉，大聲把車僮叱斥，才使那位列車長明白一切，且代表車方表示歉意，最後始在諒解空氣中，讓出了兩個座位。那天要不是那位朋友幫忙，豈不要在最後鬧出事情來嗎？我們對於那位列車長態度的溫和與明理，倒很佩服。如果盟邦在我國服務的人，都能像他那樣，中日民間的感情預計必然會日臻密切的。</p>
<h3>四十小時到北京</h3>
<p>我離開了北京雖有兩年，可是北京的風物卻依然可愛。最使我發生深刻印象的，便是我那天於午夜後一時抵前門車站，沿途電燈依然大放光明。可知在這裹對於水電方面，還沒有像上海那樣感到恐慌，不過北京近因旅客衆多，比較舒適的大飯店卻不易找尋。譬如像北京飯店，六國飯店，德國飯店，使館飯店等，都早已人滿，而且在登記簿上候補的旅客還是很多。所以如果想到北京來遊歷的人，茍無親友的話，事前必須先行電報定房，否則臨時便要發生困難。我們此次自上海動身，沿途十二分的安全，誤時也不十分多，計共費了四十小時就到了北京。如與飛機相較，也僅多出八倍的時間，總算是一個痛快的旅程！</p>

<h3>盟邦憲兵隊取締歹徒冒名索詐</h3>
<p>市民如遇敲詐應隨時報告　　近聞常有不宵份子，利用防空燈火管制時間，竟膽大妄爲，冒充盟邦日本憲兵，魚肉人民，恐嚇詐財，記者爲此特於昨（十五）日專訪憲兵滬北隊水谷五郎隊長，承告其詳。　　查最近不宵份子，冒充憲兵，恐嚇人民，詐取錢財，經憲兵當局嚴密緝拿，事發被捕者亦有，而被隱瞞逍遙法外者仍多，憲兵當局正予嚴密緝查。數日前憲兵滬北隊正拘獲冒充憲兵之不法份子二人，一爲日人，一爲華人，由日人冒充憲兵，華人冒充憲兵隊翻譯，專事在本市借端恐嚇良民，詐取錢財，致受害者累累。最近彼輩又赴一棉花號企圖敲詐，指該店供輸敵方物資，并稱業經軍部所悉，憲兵隊正在密查，如賄以錢財，則可免罪，否則須嚴予懲辦。同時又赴各妓院假稱抽鴉片烟，一待鴇婦取出烟具，即冒充憲兵載索。此外并利用防空燈火管制時間，潛入各旅館飯店硬詐，藉端洩漏燈光。如在防空時有住戶在家聚作雀戰，彼輩認爲絕好機會，如被撞見，則敲門入內嚇詐，以逼索市民證爲由詐財，諸如此類案件頗多，但僅少數得逞。惟彼等詐得錢財後，即花天　地，大事浪費，而被詐良民，多數隱瞞不敢告發。　　查最近中日人民，熱誠協力防空，一致粉碎敵機襲滬夢想，不料若輩喪盡天良之敗類，竟惡極無聊，冒大不韙。凡破壞軍部憲兵名譽者，在日本方面絕對重大罪惡案措置，且彼輩竟敢借防空犯罪，更屬可惡。現該兩人已送交軍法嚴處，治以戰時恐嚇詐財之罪。舉凡我憲兵隊外出公幹，不論軍服或便衣，隨身均携有身份證，如市民過有憲兵搜查時，可索取身份證及名刺爲憑。水谷憲兵隊長熱誠盼望中國人民，予以協力合作，如發現有可疑之憲兵及借端勒索，隨時可以電話或口頭書面向憲兵隊報告，否則隱匿不報，乃即造成助長惡風，在於民間事小，而毀壞整個憲兵名譽事大。值茲大東亞決戰之秋，全東亞人士莫不奮起爭取最後勝利，我人決當聯合盡力建設新上海，維護人民安全，以共同肅清　究宵小。</p>

<h3>小學教育座談會</h3>
<p>本報會於本月四六兩日，先後舉行大中學教育座談會，討論一般教育改進方針。本月八日下午四時，復假座工商聯誼會會議廳，召集小學教育座談會，出席者劉惠瑗。鄭寶章·姚紹秀·張新伯·沈西賓·龔家昌·陳鴻璧·吳若安·丁一心·孔鋆甫·郁樹敏·徐子長·陸朝海·胡蔚青諸先生，仍由本報社會服務處主任黃警頑君主席，茲紀錄座談要點如下：　　黃警頑：小學爲國民基本教育，其所受教育，良好與否，小之，足以影響立身處世，大之，關係國家強弱，故先進各國，重視小學教育，不亞於大學中學，因爲幼年時代，所受教育，印象最深。[種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆]，有了好的種子，自然得到好的結果了。諸君從事辦小學教育，素具經騐，對於當前小學教育問題，應興應革，以及如何改進，必具卓見。今日敝報舉行小學教師座談會，承諸位惠然蒞至，不勝感激，務請各抒宏論，幸甚。　　第一　改善教師生活問題　　黃警頑：目前教育上病理狀態，已成爲急須補救之大問題，究其最大　結，在於教師生活之不安定，值此非常時期，教育界的生活，苦不堪言，尤以小學教師爲最，一面在校教課，一面　念家中柴米汕鹽，精神不能集中，敷衍塞責，故教育界的現狀，可說陷於危機。今日本報召開座談會，請諸位就這個問題，多多發揮意見。就本報而論，向來對小學教師，具有同情。同時有教職員補助金及醫藥助金等工作，以盡服務職志。　　龔家昌：關於改善小學教師生活，主要的就是提高待遇，各校經濟情形不同，教員薪水相差也很大，本校（寗波旅滬小學）最近向校董會提呈加薪，大槪不致失望。此外尚有兩種辦法；○本募基金。○校董會辦理獎學金，以獎掖優秀清寒之學生。就個人言，本人願供獻幾點意見：○各校當局經濟公開，依總收入數百分之七十以上，分配教職員。○由與論界鼓吹，請求市政當局設法，增加教育同人特種配給，除配給米外，增加日用品的配給。○舉辦教職員家屬生產貸金，俾教師家屬，能夠經營副業。　　吳若安：依照當局的規定，學校應以學費百分之七十分配教師，並使經濟儘量公會。本校（南洋女中小學）實施公開制度，已歷三載，且以學費百分之一百分給教員。至於辦公費如組張水電等項，均取於之雜費，決不影響教員生活。本學期學費較上學期增加約四倍，但員工收入，也增加四倍，所以本校員工生活，雖然清苦，大家都能同甘共苦，維持教育。　　陳鴻　：本校（廣東小學）自民國元年創辦至今，一向採取經濟公開制度，以學費百分之九十五分配員工，並且在學期之始，先發數個月薪津，以安定教員生活。　　吳若安：本校（南洋女子小學）最近有學生持工務局科長來函，以公務員子弟資格，要求免費。查教育局雖會表示過公務員子弟免費原則，但實施辦法未經公告，本校亦有學生免費辦法，每學期免費達十萬元之數，在未接教局辦法之前，對上列之事，似乎不便接受，否則減少學校收入，間接影響教師生活，不知其他學校，遇到同樣情形否？　　沈西賀：關於這點，本校（崇實小學）也遇到過，據我所知道，教局的原則是：[低級公務人員子弟免繳一部份學費]，但[低級]與[一部]之標準爲何，應由教局規定，而申請及調查手績，亦應由教局辦理。　　孔鋆甫：本校竟有學生家長持函來校要求退費。　　黃警頑：總之，教育事業，不只是學校和教師方面的問題，而政府和社會都應該負起責任來，照目前講，當局在教育上，所盡的力量，似乎太少些。　　第二　助學運動的檢討　　黃警頑：本報辦理助學金，巳歷七屆，收到助學金額，一屆多似一屆，此固然表現社會對學生的同情，但因每屆申請入數增加，我們同時感到分配的困難。本報對申請學生，體格家境學業品行四者並重，承各校合作，無任感荷，現請諸位就申請的手續或甄別的方法·賜以卓見。　　龔家昌：甄別標準，鄙見應以[清寒爲主]，告發固然有效，但畢竟爲事後的方法，最好設法防患未然，在辦理申施手續時，須先詳細調查，但調查事務繁雜，非有大批工作人員不辦。鄙見以爲可選高年級學生担任此項工作，在每屆結果之後，就受助各生於一學期中，逐一個別訪問，將訪問記錄，作爲下一屆甄別標準，則下一屆審查，自必較易辦理。　　陳鴻璧：關於審查，若僅憑成績報告單，往往不可靠，據本人過去代辦廣東同鄉會助學金的經騐，常常有許多學校替學生作弊，發假文憑，塡假分數，朦蔽取巧。貴報辦法，由肄業學校推薦，復經甄別試騐，以防欺朦，使捐款用得其所，殊堪欽佩。至於學校方面，根本還是一個道德問題。　　鄭寶章：本校（靜安寺小學）響應助學運動，全校設百分之十免費額，另由校董會設獎學金五名，對申報新聞報市教育局助金學生，復酌量助以書費，於下午三時後，以空餘時間及教室，辦義務學校。現有一建議，即貴報託學校推薦，所發申請書張數，以全校學生百分之五爲限，此種限制，似應依各校地位而定，如高等住宅區中之學校，學生家庭大多富裕，全校中往往並無百分之五學生需要申請，反之，若干地區之學校，百分之五之申請書，實覺不敷支配，故請貴報斟酌辦理。　　黃警頑：本報對諸位之建議，表示非常歡迎。以下轉入第四版</p>

<p>從第三版轉來　　第三　小學生健康問題　　黃警頑：小學生是國家未來的主人，小學生的健康，與國家之興衰強弱，關係很大，值此生活困難之秋，保持健康，實屬不易，但學校方面，總應該儘量關顧，以保護這一羣民族的幼苗。　　徐子長：這個問題，根本在於營業問題，但是在這樣的時代，來談營業，恐怕不容易苆合實際，在治本上旣不能做到，我想就治標方面，貢獻幾點膚淺的見解：○應由學校和老師提倡清潔習慣，○由貴報辦理流通醫生，過去衛生局常傷員到校注射防疫針和種痘，現在往往不能普遍，希望貴報提倡，將此項工作，普遍起來。　　鄭寶章：衛生習慣很爲重要，本校靜安小學，平常很爲重視：○早操，限學生於早晨八時前到校，第一節課定爲早操，功效很大。○清潔檢查。現在的小學生，往往而黃肌瘦，甚易傳染肺癆等病，本校由各級級任負負檢查，一經發覺病態，隨即提醒家長，送醫治理，家境不裕者，刻請社會團體，免費診治，小學生的健康，與國民健康的關係，實在太大了。　　徐子長：關於兒童生活的清潔和衛生，首先應注重家庭和父母的習慣，但學校的責行，也不在家庭之下。腦膜炎，傷寒，肺結核等傳染病，在人數衆多，設備不全，校舍擁擠的學校裹，很容易散播，譬如教室擁擠，空間與面積不合標準，空氣不流通等，都應由學校負責，往往有許多學校，呌小學生課外勞動，做掃地，倒痰盂，揩黑板等工作，結果對小學生嫩弱的身體，受害甚大，所以我主張廢除此種制度，每校至少應有工人二人，專司清潔之事。　　沈西賓：同時我覺本市兒童娛樂塲所，如公共遊戲場，兒童公園之缺少，於兒童健康不無影響廳爲市民公園，現在更希望在各區多設兒童園及運動塲。此次南洋醫院，爲本報小學組受助學生，義務檢查體格，亦爲小學生健康之一助。務望各位教師，諭知學生，應各憑本報所發免費檢查證，按照規定日程前往受檢，莫失良機。　　徐子長：除去清潔習慣之外，運動習慣，也非常重要。　　龔家昌：在兒童公園未能開闢之前，最好能讓小學生免費入公園，現在的公園未免太貴族化了！此外我以爲課程標準和教授法之改良，亦直接或間接地影響兒童健康。　　徐子長：一般學校只重背書，我以爲除國語課一部份須精讀之外，其他一切課程，　不應採取背書方法，學校和老師決不應迎合家長心理，使學生[死讀書，讀死書，讀書死]的。　　第四　小學生課外生活問題　　黃警頑：由小學生的習慣，連想到兒童課外生活問題，[近朱者赤，近墨者黑]，兒童很純潔的心理，若不經良好的指導，很容易受到所謂]弄堂教育]，各校對於小學生生活指導，有何車特的方法，不妨多多提供。　　郁樹敏：上海的家庭，對於家庭教育，大多不十分重視，而學校與家庭聯絡匪易，最好學校延長散學時間，使小學生在導師的督導之下，多做作業，或唱遊娛樂，尤其重要的，應絕對禁止兒童閱續連環圖書。　　陳鴻璧：正如缺少兒童公園一樣，本市的兒童圖書館，好似只有少數的一二家，而兒童讀物之出版，也可說是絕無僅有的，除希望各校多加指導外，並希望出版界注意這個問題。　　吳若安：本校採取級會制，使小學生有組織，此外舉行演講會，遊藝會，各種比賽，由級任負責指導。　　徐子長：據我的意思，目前各校小學生，可說[課外無生活]，學校太注意死的知識，對藝術太忽略。我主張學校方面，至少應有訓育委員會，常常開會，研究學生的課外和校外生活。在學生組織上，保甲編制法是很值得採取的方法，如此，有組織，有指導，才能做到[眞善美][手腦心]並重的教育。　　第五　義務教育問題　　黃警頑：現在請諸位對上海義務小學，量的推廣，和質的改進，發表高論。　　徐子長：辦理義務學校，最大的困難，就是校舍，希望各學校能夠多多利用散學校的時間和空間。　　吳若安：即使校舍問題解決，目前節電，也是一個嚴重的問題。　　黃警頑；於夜校之外，希望多設晨校，利用朝氣蓬勃的早晨，救濟失學的兒童。　　吳若安：最大的問題，似乎還是生活問題，衣食不足，遑論求學，年齡低的兒童，因家長不能負担，以致遲遲不得入學，年齡較高的，因幫助家長掙錢而使停學，所以兒童，不得不拋了書本，而拿起米袋，去販大米，或做小生意去。　　鄭寶童：在貧苦大衆的家庭中，兒童失學，固然是痛苦的事，然而他們不得不顧到更大的苦痛而毅然停學，本校初辦義校的時候，來學的兒童爲數很少，其原因在於他們認爲失學並不是最大的痛苦。　　黃警頑：所以我們除希望各校創辦義校外，更加盼望各工廠，各公會，各職業團體，提倡和舉辦義校，以救濟這羣廣大的失學兒童。　　第六　其他　　黃警頑：現在請各位隨意發表意見。　　鄭寶童：小學生德性教育最要緊，在幼稚的純潔的心田上，若沒有深刻的正確的道德觀念，則下一代的國家，是很不容易樂觀的。　　陳鴻璧：問題還是在小學教師的修養。　　黃警頑：所以我們希望小學教師組織進修會。　　沈西寶：有一件很嚴重的問題，請貴報以輿論界的立塲，作公正的批評。我始終覺得教育應該是國家的事，但是我國的當局，尤其是本市教育當局，對教育事業，並未盡最大的力量。據說南京·杭州各市教育經費，佔市政經費百分之二十以上，但本市是全國經濟中心，稅收豐富，而所撥教育費，實際上不知佔千分之幾？即以私校補助費而論，到現在才發到三四月份，但教員們決不能只吃到三四月份的飯的呀！就種種方面觀察，我眞懷疑當局對教育界的關懷。　　丁一心：所以我們最大的希望，還是政治能上軋道。　　黃警頑：今天承諸位發抒儻論，榮幸之至。</p>

<h3>Current Problems in Elementary Education</h3>
<p>Elementary education is the foundation of national education, the basic undertaking that determines the future of the nation and its people. Only when elementary education is well-managed can other secondary, university, and specialized education easily develop and achieve results. Since the 20th century, the elementary education in Japan and Germany has been the best. Those who are now dedicating themselves to serving their own countries and striving for national glory are all elementary school students from ten or twenty years ago! Looking back at our country, since the beginning of the new education at the end of the Qing Dynasty, although national basic education has also been vigorously promoted, the results have not been significant due to the evolution of the political situation. For the sake of the future backbone talents of the country and society, we really must make up our minds and put in painstaking efforts to establish a solid foundation for today's elementary education. The purpose of this newspaper's elementary education symposium, held after the two symposia on higher education, is also to achieve this, hoping to attract special attention and encourage the education authorities and the private education sector to strive forward! (The minutes of the symposium can be found on page 3 of today's newspaper.)</p>
<p>There are too many current problems in elementary education in our country. From the system, content, and methods to the textbook problem, it is truly a tangled mess, and it is definitely not something that can be solved by one or two symposia or one or two papers. However, the following problems are the most serious and possible to discuss, possible to solve, and must be solved first at this time and place:</p>
<p>First, improve the lives of faculty and staff, especially the lives of elementary school teachers. This newspaper has repeatedly appealed for this. Unfortunately, our power is too small. Apart from providing subsidies for faculty and staff and medical subsidies, there are no particularly gratifying achievements to report. What we expect from all parties today is: ○ We hope that the authorities will allocate daily necessities in addition to the special allocation of rice, and take other measures to give special preference to elementary school teachers. ○ We hope that all sectors of society, such as medicine, transportation, culture, and entertainment, will give special preferential treatment to faculty and staff; ○ We hope that wealthier parents of students will donate generously to establish undertakings that help improve the lives of faculty and staff, such as production loans for faculty and staff family members, etc.; ○ We hope that school authorities will implement economic transparency, improve the treatment of faculty and staff, and the most important thing is to increase salaries and provide reasonable board and lodging, and waive all fees for faculty and staff children to attend school. For private schools, in addition to those with excellent history, the education authorities should manage their finances to prevent the principal from controlling them alone. At present, there are many larger schools (referring to elementary, middle, and universities) that charge one to two million yuan per semester, and it is especially necessary to prevent principals from using money for speculative behavior.</p>
<p>Second, regarding strengthening the promotion of the student aid movement and rescuing out-of-school children, it still requires the cooperation of all parties to address the reality at this time and place! Our most urgent hope today is: ○ Wealthier families in society should donate more and more to jointly rescue out-of-school children. ○ Each school should set up as many free school places as possible. It would be best if every principal could take the initiative and consider the largest number of free school places as the greatest honor. ○ Each school should strengthen communication and cooperation with student aid organizations to jointly improve the technical aspects of the student aid movement, such as the screening standards and review methods determined at this elementary education symposium are very important. ○ In addition to striving especially hard, middle, high school, and university students who receive student aid should also participate in assisting in promoting the student aid movement as much as possible, such as investigation, publicity, and other affairs.</p>
<p>Third, is the issue of elementary school teacher qualifications: We have always believed that this is the most serious problem in current elementary education. Improving the material life of elementary school teachers only solves half of the problem. Further progress is needed in increasing the quantity and improving the quality of teachers. Here, we hope that the authorities will devote more efforts to improving and developing teacher training, and at the same time, we still hope that all of you who are currently engaged in elementary education will work hard on the following points: ○ Enrich your own knowledge and skills in your field, and strive to increase efficiency; ○ Enrich your social knowledge, mainly to have a correct understanding of current events, society, and politics; without correct and rich practical knowledge, you cannot teach students who can learn and be useful; ○ Promote the collective learning movement, first organize elementary school teacher learning associations, etc. We must solemnly point out that teaching dead books and teaching books to death is harmful and unprofitable to the country, the nation, and society!</p>
<p>What we have described above is, of course, in terms of the entire education system. Shanghai, as the center of national education, bears an even more arduous educational mission. If we try to review the educational administration of this city in recent years, it must be said that it has been too quiet and passive. The biggest shortcoming is the failure to closely connect with the private education sector. At the same time, the amount of education funding is too small. In the past, the first district only accounted for 9% of the total administrative expenses, and the proportion of education expenses in the municipal government was even smaller. This has also been specifically suggested in the elementary school teacher symposium.</p>
<p>The newly appointed Director of the Education Bureau of this city, Mr. Dai Yingfu, has now taken office. Mr. Dai is rich in experience in educational administration and is courageous in taking responsibility. He will definitely attach importance to the educational mission of this city and refresh educational administration. However, a clever woman cannot cook without rice. First, it is necessary to increase education funding in order to realize ideal plans. In summary, what we hope from the authorities today is: ○ Stabilize the lives of teachers. ○ Rescue out-of-school children. ○ Manage private schools and make their finances transparent. ○ Ban unqualified schools, because the harm of unqualified schools is actually greater than not having schools. We believe that public security, people's livelihood, and education are the three major problems in Shanghai at present, which urgently need the joint efforts of the authorities and the people to solve.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister and Premier of Manchukuo Exchanged Broadcasts Yesterday, Expressing Determination to Defend Greater East Asia and Seek Final Victory in the War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso and Manchukuo's Premier Zhang held an exchange broadcast at 7:00 PM on the 15th. The Japanese Prime Minister poured out his determination to defend Greater East Asia, saying that he would seize the opportunity, take the offensive, and seek the final victory in the war. Manchukuo's Premier Zhang expressed his deep gratitude for Japan's unchanging policy towards Manchukuo, saying that the 45 million people of Manchukuo are determined to unite with Japan to jointly destroy the enemy. It is also said that this year's Manchukuo harvest will solve the food problem between Japan and Manchukuo. The gist of the report is as follows:</p>
<h3>Speech by the Japanese Prime Minister</h3>
<p>When your country was founded, the Empire took the lead in recognizing it. In the past twelve years, the Empire has helped your country to organize various domestic systems, ensure public security, enrich internal affairs, and abolish extraterritorial rights, establish joint defense between Japan and Manchukuo, and other measures, so that your country's foundation has become more and more solid. On the other hand, in terms of national defense, it has always maintained a relationship of two as one with Japan. Needless to say, it has gradually established diplomatic relations with the countries of Greater East Asia and even powerful European countries, and has jumped to become an independent and complete country, which is very commendable. At present, the Greater East Asia War has been going on for more than three and a half years, and the enemy is wantonly invading East Asia, changing its ways and intensifying its efforts. The Japanese Empire is determined to seize the opportunity and take the offensive to achieve the final victory. Externally, it will firmly adhere to its diplomatic policy and promote the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Your country will contribute its material and spiritual strength and fully cooperate with Japan. In particular, it has made great contributions to Japan in the supply of military supplies and food. The 100 million people of Japan are grateful beyond words. At this critical stage of the decisive battle, the countries and peoples of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must closely unite, give full play to their total strength, and strive for victory and destroy the enemy in the face of the common goal of revitalizing Greater East Asia. This war is a decisive battle for one billion people in Asia. Your country has a deep understanding of this, so it will be able to work with Japan to form the core of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, consolidate victory, and work hard to establish the way of righteousness in East Asia where all nations prosper together. People of Manchukuo, the time for the decisive battle is approaching, so you must work with Japan with one heart and one mind and move towards destroying the enemy, the United States and Britain.</p>
<h3>Speech by Premier Zhang</h3>
<p>Japan has recognized our country for twelve years. During this period, Japan has devoted itself to overcoming all the difficult and inferior conditions and providing our country with the most important and great assistance in construction. At the same time, thanks to the concerted efforts of officials and civilians in our country, Manchukuo has also accumulated a solid national strength that is no less than that of advanced countries. At a time when the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more intense and the future of Greater East Asia is becoming more and more difficult, Manchukuo, which has the mission of building Greater East Asia in politics, deeply feels that its task is arduous and its responsibility is inescapable. Today, the only way for us to repay the friendship of our allies for many years is to use our already enriched national strength to complete the Greater East Asia War side by side with Japan. The importance of this mission is no greater than today. His Majesty the Emperor of the enemy country specially summoned this official and Chief of the General Affairs Department Takebe on August 31 to give instructions, and instructed the people of Manchukuo, saying: Japan's prosperity is Manchukuo's prosperity, Japan's demise is Manchukuo's demise, and the rise and fall of Japan and Manchukuo is also the rise and fall of the entire East Asia. At this time, you should recognize this point even more and use all means to concentrate on completing the holy war. At the same time, he also donated internal currency to the Japanese military authorities for the production of aircraft to assist frontline operations. We are deeply grateful for the far-reaching nature of His Majesty the Emperor's measures. Our 45 million people should put the above-mentioned imperial edict into practice and strive to increase our combat power and destroy the United States and Britain in order to comfort the Holy Spirit in the slightest. Today, the Manchukuo authorities are actively raising war funds to increase combat power and destroy the United States and Britain. The people of Manchukuo are also pouring their hearts into completing the war. As for this year's crops, there will also be an unprecedented bumper harvest since the founding of the country, so there is no sense of insecurity in the food problem between Japan and Manchukuo, and the mission that the food base of Greater East Asia should have will be completed. In addition, the various mines and factories in Manchukuo are also launching an active movement to increase production and destroy the United States and Britain. As mentioned above, the heroic posture of officials and civilians as one is the posture of Manchukuo today. On this meaningful anniversary, I deeply hope that our people will renew their determination and work with Japan with one heart and one mind to destroy the United States and Britain.</p>
<h3>Commemorative Celebration</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japan-Manchukuo Central Association hosted a commemorative celebration for the 12th anniversary of Japan's recognition of Manchukuo at the Imperial Hotel on the 15th. Participants included Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu, the Ambassador of Manchukuo to Japan, and Japanese officials such as Information Bureau President Ogata, Minister of Education Ninomiya, Minister of Justice Matsuzaka, and many other generals and related representatives. After the meeting began, Association President Mitsuo Miyata delivered an opening speech, followed by speeches by Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu, Ambassador Wang, and Information Bureau President Ogata. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM. Ambassador Wang Yunqing of Manchukuo to Japan also gave a speech, the gist of which was: Japan's rise and fall is the rise and fall of Manchukuo, and also the rise and fall of the entire Greater East Asia. Manchukuo is now exerting all its strength to increase food production and is determined to rise up and strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops on Both Sides of the Nu River Take a Pincer Attack Posture</h3>
<p>The Battle of Longling Intensifies</p>
<p>Nu River Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force has launched a large-scale counter-offensive to recapture the Yunnan-Burma Highway. However, due to the bravery of the Japanese troops and their fierce harassment of the rear base, their fighting spirit has been declining day by day. Since last autumn, only one division of troops has been able to sneak into the west bank of the Nu River to attack. Last year, large numbers of troops were sent across the Nu River one after another. In mid-May, the 11th and 20th Group Armies, with a total of 150,000 troops, were sent to the Tengyue, Longling, and Lameng areas, and fierce battles broke out between the two sides. The main force of the 20th Group Army was poured into Tengyue, and the Japanese troops continued to send new reinforcements to defeat the Chongqing troops everywhere. In addition to the existing divisions, the Chongqing troops in Longling have also transferred troops from other places in an attempt to recapture Longling, a key point on the Yunnan-Burma Highway. It is said that Wei Lihuang has been ordered to defend the current position to the death. The new Japanese reinforcements have gradually captured the strongholds of the Chongqing troops from the Xiaosongshan area in the south and the Daiyongshan and Xunshan mountains in the northwest, forcing them to the east of Longling. The Japanese air force in Burma is also cooperating with each other, so the military pressure on the Chongqing troops is gradually increasing.</p>
<p>A certain base on the Nu River Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese troops in Longling are currently launching an annihilation battle against the 11th Group Army of Chongqing near Longling with the cooperation of large formations of Japanese aircraft. Conversely, the Chongqing troops are transferring rescue troops from various places to strengthen their combat power and stubbornly recapture Longling, repeatedly carrying out counter-attacks. The Japanese troops immediately annihilated them everywhere, causing them to fall into chaos. One day, a powerful unit of Japanese troops who crossed the Longling River attacked the flank of the Chongqing troops and drove out the Chongqing troops on Anglong Mountain, and then advanced to a certain place north of the Nu River. A separate Japanese unit that echoed this also attacked the high ground south of the Nu River. The Chongqing troops near the high ground were attacked from the north and south. A large-scale encirclement and annihilation battle is currently being carried out with Longling as the center, echoing from north to south. The frontline combat strength of the Chongqing Provisional 39th Division has now been reduced from a division to a company. The Chongqing troops have suffered heavy losses, and there are signs of a comprehensive shake-up.</p>
<h3>Frequent Air Raids in the Pacific, More Than a Dozen Enemy Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 14th (Central News Agency) - On the 12th, a joint formation of enemy fighters and bombers, totaling about 90 aircraft, raided the Gama Bay area of Halmahera Island during the day. The Japanese army shot down eight of them. In addition, a total of 70 enemy small aircraft raided the Bula area of Tanahmerah Island. One was shot down. On the same day, 50 enemy aircraft, mainly B-24s, raided the Mindanao area. Local Japanese troops shot down four of them. In the Babo area of New Guinea, 40 B-25s raided. The damage to the Japanese side in all aspects was extremely minor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to statistics for August, a total of approximately 28,600 enemy aircraft raided the entire Greater East Asia theater. Conversely, the Japanese air force and ground air defense units achieved a total of 294 American aircraft shot down and 522 destroyed in offensive and defensive battles, totaling 816 aircraft.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Yamamoto's Speech</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 15th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to Thailand, Kumaichi Yamamoto, gave a speech stating that Japan's fundamental national policy is to defend East Asia and liberate the nations of East Asia. Therefore, the Japanese government has decided to support Thailand's independence and prosperity. Therefore, the consistent policy will not change due to the reorganization of the cabinet and the change of ambassadors.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Passes New Bond Issuance</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - After Japan decided to add 25 billion yuan to the temporary military budget, it issued new bonds worth more than 5.197 billion yuan. In order to digest these bonds, it was decided to increase national savings in the 19th year. The National Savings Encouragement Committee was held at the Ministry of Finance on the 13th. As a result of the agreement, it was decided to increase the current target amount of 36 billion yuan by 5 billion yuan to 41 billion yuan. This was formally approved by the cabinet on the 15th and announced by the Information Bureau. According to Minister of Finance Ishiwatari, after the additional wartime military budget is established, the national savings target for this year will also be increased by 5 billion yuan, totaling 41 billion yuan. We hope that the people will practice wartime life and cooperate to complete this new target. Announcement by the Japanese Navy Ministry.</p>
<h3>Vice Admiral Tsukahara Appointed Commander of Yokosuka</h3>
<p>Vice Admiral Totsuka Appointed Director of the Naval Air Command</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Navy Ministry announced at 4:30 PM on the 15th: ○ Vice Admiral Tsukahara Nishizo was appointed Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District. With this order, Admiral Nomura Naokuni, the former commander, was dismissed and will be given another appointment. ○ Vice Admiral Totsuka Michitaro was appointed Director of the Naval Air Command. With this order. According to reports, Vice Admiral Tsukahara, the newly appointed Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District, and Vice Admiral Totsuka, the newly appointed Director of the Naval Air Command, have both devoted themselves to building the Japanese naval air force. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they served as commanders of fleets and were active on the front lines, demonstrating their military talents. This personnel adjustment shows the Japanese Navy's determination to engage in an air battle in the Pacific. Their future activities are highly anticipated.</p>
<h3>Quebec Conference: British and American Attempts Fail</h3>
<p>Director Matsushima Gives a Speech</p>
<p>The Japanese Fleet Reporting Department in China specially met with Chinese news reporters in Shanghai yesterday (the 15th). Director Matsushima of the Reporting Department gave a detailed explanation of the recent Quebec Conference held by the anti-Axis powers, the Soviet Union's refusal to participate, which proves the rift between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and Chiang Kai-shek's reliance on foreign forces, which allows Britain and the United States to exploit Chinese resources, which deserves serious attention.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Refuses to Attend Conference</h3>
<p>Director Matsushima first stated: Regarding the Quebec Conference recently held by the anti-Axis powers, the purpose revealed is to address the problems of the Pacific and Europe. The content of the meeting disclosed by the Secretary of the President of the United States actually stated that it was to develop the ability of British and American joint military operations in the Pacific and Europe. The British and Americans hoped that the Soviet Union would participate in this conference, but Stalin refused to attend, which immediately caused the British and American attempts to fail. In his speech, he even falsely claimed that the Soviet Union and the United States were taking the same steps, which is actually wishful thinking.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Side Attempts to Rely on Foreign Forces</h3>
<p>Secondly, the military talks between Chiang Kai-shek and Hurley have not yet been announced. At the same time, Song Ziwen also participated in the economic talks between Chiang Kai-shek and Nelson on the 14th of this month. The purpose of these two people's visit to Chongqing is to continue the meeting of Chongqing [Resistance War] and to discuss post-war development issues. Therefore, Hurley's visit to Chongqing deserves special attention. In addition to the fact that the Chongqing regime relies on foreign forces to facilitate its [Resistance War], it also needs to rely on foreign forces to engage in development and construction after the war, so we should pay serious attention. Especially the most obvious recently is the trend of relying on external strength and internal aid. For example, yesterday (the 14th), the Chongqing side promoted Germany's comprehensive peace, which had a huge impact on the local stock market. Director Xuan said: I deeply feel that if the reserve force itself in the future has to rely on the crisis of foreign forces, then the domestic people's livelihood will be affected even more, and this problem should be paid special attention to and studied.</p>
<h3>Confidence in Victory in East Asia</h3>
<p>If you want to save yourself, you must rely on your own strength. Although the European war situation is tense at present, we will never let the European war affect the Greater East Asia War. We have a firm belief in completing the victory in the Greater East Asia War. Regarding the China issue, China is vast and rich in resources. In the past, as a result of the exploitation by Britain and the United States in many ways, the resources enjoyed by the Chinese people were quite small. In order to break the exploitation of small and weak nations, we launched the Greater East Asia War of Justice. However, the Chongqing side does not hesitate to flatter and rely on foreign forces to fight the war, and plans to rely on foreign forces to develop after the war. This action is particularly welcome to our ally Japan. Recently, Chinese youths have realized that the concept of saving China must rely on China's own strength and the assistance of its ally Japan to save China from danger. At the same time, Japan's actions should sincerely strive for comprehensive peace and seek the happiness of the Chinese people.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Production Increase Conference Convenes Liaison Meeting of Various Provinces and Cities to Review Important Issues and Obtain Concrete Conclusions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Liaison Meeting on Agricultural Production Increase of various provinces and cities was held yesterday (the 15th) morning in the conference hall of the Ministry of Industry under the auspices of the Executive Yuan Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee. A total of more than 30 people attended, including representatives from the Promotion Committees of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces, the cities of Beijing and Shanghai, representatives from the Huaihai Provincial Government, representatives from relevant ministries and commissions of the Central Government, and all staff members above the section chief of the Committee. The conference began at 9:30 AM. First, Huang Zhao, the Secretary-General of the Committee, delivered an opening speech on behalf of Chairman Chen, elaborating in detail on the significance of the meeting and the expectations for various provinces and cities. It was briefly stated that the agricultural production increase work this year has achieved considerable results since September, but it is still far from what we hoped for. Therefore, at the end of the production increase year, we are convening this meeting to review the past and plan for the future, which is of profound significance. We sincerely hope that the representatives attending will report in detail on the past work situation, especially the difficulties in promoting the work, and jointly discuss improvements. It is hoped that the central and local governments will move towards consistency in the agricultural production increase work in the future. Subsequently, the relevant agencies and representatives of various provinces and cities successively reported on the progress of the production increase work in their respective regions, all of which were very concise and well done. Then, the discussion began, and concrete conclusions were reached: (A) Regarding organization, ○ If the organizational rules of the Promotion Committees of various provinces and cities have not yet been drafted, they should be drafted as soon as possible in accordance with the organizational rules. ○ If the county and district Promotion Committees in the production increase areas have not been established, the provincial and municipal Promotion Committees should urge them to organize as soon as possible. (B) Regarding the distribution of production increase funds, ○ The Promotion Committees of various provinces and cities should apply for production increase funds in accordance with the regulations of the Central Government. ○ The application for production increase funds by local cooperatives shall be approved by the Promotion Committees of the provinces and cities first, and then the application shall be forwarded to the relevant ministries and commissions by the Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan. (C) In terms of work, ○ The work reports of the Promotion Committees of various provinces and cities shall be submitted to the Central Government on a monthly basis. ○ The Promotion Committees of various provinces and cities should maintain close contact with the county and district Promotion Committees and the Central Government. All the above issues have concrete conclusions. It is believed that the conference has achieved extraordinarily satisfactory results, which will be of great help to the promotion of future production increase work.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Fiercely Bombs Liuzhou Airfield</h3>
<p>Chongqing American Aircraft Raid Sanshui Unsuccessful</p>
<p>China Base, 14th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese bomber squadron raided Liuzhou, the Chongqing army's counter-offensive base, at dawn on the 14th, heavily damaging the area near the airfield. Another squadron of Japanese aircraft bombed Rongrong (27 kilometers northeast of Liuzhou), a key point on the Xiang-Gui Railway, near the station, and fiercely bombed the material warehouses and vehicle groups there before safely flying back to a certain place. A certain base on the China Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - At 11:00 AM on the 14th, approximately 20 P-40 aircraft from the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing raided Sanshui (40 kilometers west of Guangzhou).

<h3>Japanese Army Completely Occupies Quan County</h3>
<p>Hankou, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Japanese army base on the Hunan Front, the Japanese rapid troops have broken through the Guangxi Province and are advancing westward with the momentum of a broken bamboo. At 1:00 AM on the 14th, they broke into Quan County, repelled the resistance of a corps of the Chongqing 93rd Army, and completely occupied it. Japanese Army Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army completely occupied Quan County, a key point in the Xiang-Gui Province, on the 14th. According to reports, the county seat is located on the bank of the Xiang River, 80 kilometers from the provincial border, and is a key point on the Xiang-Gui Railway. It has been a key point of contact between Hunan and Guangxi provinces since ancient times, and is the military, political, and economic center of northern Guangxi Province, and is especially a forward stronghold for the defense of Guilin, which is of great military value. Due to the fall of Quan County, the strategic posture of the Japanese troops occupying Xinning and the Simen Bridge in the northwest and the Japanese troops controlling the Quan County plain has become more consolidated. This is a major threat to Chongqing and the Chongqing American Air Force.</p>

<p>Fifteenth dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing: In order to respect freedom of speech, accept public opinion and criticism, and ensure that the people of the entire nation truly understand the reality of the current situation and are not swayed by enemy propaganda, the Propaganda Department has formulated the following key points for improving news censorship: ○ Regarding the attitude toward newspaper and magazine commentary, the department will abandon the previous policy of passive suppression and adopt a cooperative policy. Propaganda offices, sections, and news censorship bureaus in all areas should establish close contact with newspaper and magazine editors so that they can jointly move toward harmonious development and achieve effective propaganda. ○ All well-intentioned construction and criticism will not be suppressed and will be supported and guided. However, malicious incitement or unrealistic and boastful language that is sufficient to agitate people's hearts will still be strictly suppressed. ○ In news reporting, except for military, political, and diplomatic secrets, the content of news should be complete, truthful, and clear. However, reporting that is driven by hatred, attack, or distortion of facts will still be strictly supervised. ○ Regarding local news in various areas, propaganda offices (sections) in all areas should find ways to ensure that the press and local authorities maintain regular contact to avoid misunderstandings. ○ Newspapers and magazines in all areas should be guided by the local propaganda offices (sections) to increase contact with prominent figures and scholars in civil society, as well as civil leaders, so that genuine public opinion can be fully expressed and provided to the government for reference, establishing a force to promote political progress.</p>

<p>Fifteenth dispatch from the Central News Agency in Lisbon: According to the Soviet military headquarters regarding the Eastern Front: The Cossack cavalry vanguard has now broken through the Czechoslovakian-Polish border and advanced into Polish territory. Furthermore, German troops in East Prussia have retreated from the important point of Lomza, and therefore Soviet troops have advanced to a location approximately fifteen miles south of the East Prussian border. The battles outside of Warsaw are intensifying with each passing Soviet reinforcement. Intense fighting between both armies appear to have begun in the southeast region of the city. There are no major changes to the military situation in Outer Transylvania. Fifteenth dispatch from the Central News Agency in Berlin: German News Agency reports: Military information: The fierce Soviet offensive was repelled today by bravely resisting German troops. East of Warsaw, German troops withdrew from the suburb of Praga according to plan. The enemy's attempt to launch a wedge-shaped offensive against the German defensive operation, hoping to completely occupy the Vistula River bridgehead, was defeated by German troops.</p>

<h3>Canadian Troops to Participate in Pacific War</h3>
<p>Being Discussed at the Quebec Conference</p>
<p>Fifteenth dispatch from the Central News Agency in Stockholm: The Haitong News Agency reports: A special correspondent from the "[Manchester Guardian]" says that the most difficult issue at the Quebec Conference is Canada's participation in the Pacific War. The resolution to this issue will be decided in the conversations between Churchill and Canadian Prime Minister King, because anti-overseas war sentiment is increasingly prevalent in Canada; therefore, it is expected that Canada will only dispatch a small number of troops to fight in the Pacific. American newspapers are generally predicting that the appointment of the new commander of the anti-Axis forces in the Pacific will be announced at the end of the Quebec Conference.</p>

<h3>Battle at the Belfort Gap Enters New Phase</h3>
<p>Fight for Aachen Continues</p>
<p>Fifteenth dispatch from the Central News Agency at the Belfort Gap: The Haitong News Agency reports: The Allied offensive at the Belfort Gap may create a situation similar to Cassino. Geographically, the valley between the Vosges Mountains and the Swiss Jura Mountains is very similar to Cassino in Italy. The German troops now holding this area have the same determination to resist as the German troops who held Cassino this spring. Among the Allied troops attacking the Belfort Gap this time are those who fought at Cassino. The operation of the U.S. Seventh Army in the Belfort area has clearly entered a new phase, and the fighting is becoming more intense. The battle on the southern flank has developed into fierce trench warfare in most areas. The sudden northward turn of the U.S. Sixth Army Group, intending to advance from Zasu to Belfort, shows the failure of its original offensive plan. Fifteenth dispatch from the Central News Agency in Berlin: German News Agency military report: The focus of the Western Front is once again between Maastricht and a certain stronghold southeast of Aachen, where fierce battles are currently taking place to seize the outposts of the Western Wall.</p>

<h3>From Shanghai to Beijing</h3>
<p>— By our Special Traveling Correspondent Wu Gong</p>
<p>This is the fifth time in my life that I have traveled to the North. The first two times were before the Incident [likely the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War], and although the latter two times were after the Incident, it has been two years since my fourth trip north. Originally, there was nothing worth recording on the journey, but due to the recent fluctuations in prices, I have seen many strange phenomena, which cannot help but make me speak out.</p>
<h3>Black Market Tickets and Unreasonable Extortion</h3>
<p>Mentioning travel these days will probably give anyone a headache! For example, there's no way to buy train tickets, and in addition to being crowded along the way, you're subjected to all kinds of trouble everywhere, which is an undeniable fact. A first-class ticket from Shanghai to Beijing costs 2,850 yuan, which is probably half the price of a second-class ticket compared to the black market! However, in addition to the prevalence of black market ticket sales, after the recent rectification by the Huazhong Railway Authority, the boarding order at the Shanghai North Station has improved, and all the previous chaos and extortion have noticeably decreased. This shows that the suggestions made by Shanghai public opinion regarding transportation improvements in the past were not a waste of words, and at the same time, it clearly demonstrates the Allied powers' determination to cooperate. It only took six hours to reach Nanjing from Shanghai. Our train was not delayed that day, and it arrived on time at the Xia Kai Station at 2:30 in the afternoon. Because there was plenty of time, we did not delay in Nanjing and immediately crossed the river to go straight to the Pukou Station. But the situation there was different; not only was the order chaotic, but also we saw hundreds of yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes flying everywhere, which made us deeply feel the reality of the currency devaluation. Fortunately, a fellow traveler of the reporter had special escorts, so he was not affected, but one of the travelers I was with was extorted 5,000 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes because he was lost in the crowded mass of people. The truth is that he was a person specializing in the chemical industry who brought some samples of Western medicine from Shanghai to Tianjin to test and manufacture, but when he arrived at the Pukou Station, the inspectors used the name "[Western medicine]" to demand a fine of 5,000 yuan from him. He said that these were samples and not worth much, so you can take them for public use. But the inspector shook his head, did not want to confiscate them, and detained him with "[Bureau Take]", which finally made that friend sacrifice 5,000 yuan to catch the train. There was also a professor at Peking University who was fined because he had too much luggage, and it cost him a total of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan to pass through checkpoints with banknotes along the way from Xiaguan to Pukou. We couldn't help but feel chilled when we saw these facts! Someone calculated that these inspectors can extort a staggering one million yuan per train arrival and departure.</p>
<h3>Train Porters Are Arrogant and Overbearing</h3>
<p>Because we had special escorts, we got on the Jinpu Line train very early. But when we got on the train, there were already many passengers on the train, especially the second-class seats were already overcrowded. Later, we asked them and learned that they had paid a huge amount of money similar to a toll to obtain such privileges. We went to the first-class carriage but there was no one there, but the words "[Designated by the Embassy]" were written on each seat in chalk. We had no choice but to go to another carriage, which was second-class, but half of the carriage also had "[Used as First Class]" written on it in chalk. At the same time, the train porters were busy, driving away second-class passengers on the one hand, and on the other hand, more experienced travelers were negotiating with them. We sat down without any trouble because we had first-class tickets in hand at this moment. After the train started, we learned that the so-called "[Used as First Class]" was originally a formality, and the situation of "money can make the gods move" made you fully understand its meaning there. When the train was approaching Xuzhou, these pot-bellied train porters quickly wiped off the "[Used as First Class]" chalk, and they were full of joy, planning how to spend this good evening! Speaking of train porters, they are just servants on the train, but they are especially authoritative on the Jinpu Line (referring to south of Jinan). They can use some clever methods to make a first-class passenger have no seat, and they can also make a second-class passenger feel as comfortable as a first-class passenger. We can hardly imagine that after eight years of war, the morals of the children who serve on the train have fallen to such an extent! And they think they have reliable support behind them, and they don't treat ordinary passengers as "[people]" at all, as if only train porters are authorities in the world! They scold and beat those who are more honest or poor. These are all facts that the reporter witnessed this time. I hope that the railway authorities from Pukou to Jinan will pay more attention, because this kind of fact is especially harmful to the feelings between the Chinese and Japanese people! I will now give an example: After midnight on September 5th, when the train departed from Xuzhou, we boldly walked into the real first class because the train porters had wiped off the "[Used as First Class]" chalk. About an hour later, a dispute suddenly arose in the carriage. It turned out that an extremely fierce train porter was gesticulating to drive away a colonel officer from the Nanjing Gendarmerie Headquarters of the National Government. The reason was that a Allied regimental commander came up at Lincheng, so he wanted to vacate the seat occupied by the colonel officer in advance. However, all the first-class carriages were mostly filled with passengers, and they had no place to make way for the three of them, so they quarreled over this. The extremely fierce train porter was not only arrogant but also had no human breath at all. Later, although the train conductor came to explain, the train porter still stubbornly insisted on his point of view and refused to budge. We clearly heard the train conductor say that because two Allied officers were coming up ahead, they asked them to give up two seats, but unexpectedly the train porter gradually wanted to force them to give up all four seats. As a result, the situation almost came to a standstill, because the officer did not understand Japanese and the train conductor did not understand Chinese, so the train porter could only stir up trouble in the middle. Later, we saw that we really couldn't bear it any longer, so we asked a friend who was proficient in Japanese to stand up and interfere, and loudly scolded the train porter, which made the train conductor understand everything and express his apologies on behalf of the train. Finally, in an atmosphere of understanding, two seats were given up. If it hadn't been for that friend's help that day, wouldn't things have come to a head in the end? We admired the train conductor's gentle and sensible attitude. If the people serving in our country in the Allies could all be like him, it is expected that the feelings between the Chinese and Japanese people would become closer day by day.</p>
<h3>Forty Hours to Beijing</h3>
<p>Although I have been away from Beijing for two years, the scenery of Beijing is still lovely. What impressed me the most was that when I arrived at Qianmen Station at 1:00 a.m. that day, the electric lights were still shining brightly along the way. It can be seen that there is no panic about water and electricity here like in Shanghai. However, it is not easy to find a more comfortable hotel in Beijing due to the large number of tourists recently. For example, the Beijing Hotel, the Six Nations Hotel, the German Hotel, and the Embassy Hotel are all full, and there are still many tourists waiting on the registration book. Therefore, if you want to travel to Beijing, if you don't have relatives or friends, you must first telegraph to book a room in advance, otherwise you will have difficulties temporarily. We started from Shanghai this time, and it was very safe along the way, and the delay was not very long. It took a total of forty hours to reach Beijing. Compared with airplanes, it only took eight times as long, so it was a pleasant journey!</p>

<h3>Allied Military Police Crack Down on Imposters Demanding Money by Fraud</h3>
<p>Citizens Should Report Extortion Immediately</p>
<p>It has recently come to light that unscrupulous individuals are exploiting the air raid blackout period to boldly impersonate Allied Japanese military police, extorting and terrorizing the people for money. The reporter interviewed Major Goro Mizutani, commander of the Shanghai North Detachment of the military police, yesterday (the 15th) to learn more about the situation. It has been discovered that unscrupulous individuals have been impersonating military police, terrorizing the people, and defrauding them of money. The military police authorities are conducting a thorough investigation and have arrested some perpetrators, but many remain at large. The military police authorities are intensifying their efforts to apprehend these criminals. Several days ago, the Shanghai North Detachment of the military police apprehended two lawbreakers impersonating military police, one Japanese and one Chinese. The Japanese individual impersonated a military police officer, while the Chinese individual impersonated a translator for the military police, engaging in extortion and terrorizing honest citizens in the city, resulting in numerous victims. Recently, they went to a cotton firm in an attempt to extort money, accusing the firm of supplying materials to the enemy and claiming that the military authorities were aware of this and were secretly investigating. They stated that if the firm provided a bribe, they could avoid punishment; otherwise, they would be severely punished. They also visited various brothels, falsely claiming to be smoking opium, and as soon as the madam produced the smoking paraphernalia, they impersonated military police to demand money. Furthermore, they exploited the air raid blackout period to sneak into hotels and extort money, using the excuse of leaking light. If residents were playing mahjong at home during an air raid, these individuals saw it as an excellent opportunity to knock on the door and threaten extortion, demanding money under the pretext of checking citizens' identification. Many cases of this nature have occurred, but only a few have been successful. However, after defrauding people of money, these individuals squandered it lavishly, while the defrauded citizens mostly remained silent and dared not report the incidents. It has been discovered that Chinese and Japanese citizens are working together earnestly to prevent air raids, and are united in foiling enemy planes' dreams of attacking Shanghai. Unexpectedly, these heartless villains have acted so wickedly and shamelessly, daring to commit such outrageous acts. Anyone who damages the reputation of the military police of the military authorities will be dealt with as a major criminal case in Japan, and their audacity in committing crimes by exploiting air raids is even more despicable. The two individuals have already been handed over to the military court for strict punishment, and will be charged with extortion during wartime. Whenever our military police go out on official business, whether in uniform or plainclothes, they carry identification. If citizens are subjected to a search by military police, they can request to see the identification and business card as proof. Major Mizutani sincerely hopes that the Chinese people will cooperate, and that any suspicious military police or instances of extortion should be reported to the military police by telephone or in writing. Otherwise, concealing such information will only encourage evil practices. A small matter among the people can have a large impact on the reputation of the military police. At this critical moment in the Great East Asia War, everyone in East Asia is rising up to fight for final victory. We are determined to unite and do our best to build a new Shanghai, protect the safety of the people, and jointly eliminate evildoers.</p>
<h3>12th Anniversary of the Founding of Manchukuo Commemorated</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 15th) was the 12th anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo. The Manchukuo General Consulate in Shanghai held a reception for the Chinese and Japanese press on the 9th floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund at 3:00 p.m., hosted by Consul General Ye himself. During the reception, Consul General Ye stood up and delivered a speech, reporting on the founding of Manchukuo in detail and strongly declaring his determination to complete the Great East Asia War.</p>

Mr. Li Junde has been appointed as the director of the office. It is reported that the office will be officially established today (the 16th).</p>
<h3>Police Consumer Cooperative Distributes Rice Already Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Police Bureau Consumer Cooperative of this city previously had manager Ding and section chief Tsuda travel to Wuhu to purchase rice. Since then, the bureau has hired Mr. Yoshiwo Miyara as a consultant, who spared no effort to go to Wuhu himself. On August 14th, 3,800 bags were loaded and shipped to Shanghai. Fortunately, consultant Miyara greatly contributed to the shipment of rice to Shanghai for distribution. Currently, people are being urged to pick them up, and as soon as the procedures are completed, the rice can be distributed according to regulations in the near future.</p>
<h3>Cotton Control Council and Flour and Wheat Council to Discuss Purchasing Cotton and Wheat</h3>
<p>The Cotton Control Committee of the General Chamber of Commerce is currently meeting for several days to discuss the purchasing policy for new cotton after the autumn of this year. The cotton purchasing organization will also be adjusted, and it is reported that a reasonable evaluation will be made for the purchase price of new cotton. It is reported that the first phase of the wheat purchasing work of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee of the General Chamber of Commerce has come to an end, with more than one million bags of wheat purchased, which is a good result. It is reported that the second phase of wheat purchasing will begin soon. The council convened wheat purchasers from various regions to Shanghai the other day to discuss the steps for the second phase of wheat purchasing. It is reported that the purchase price of wheat in the second phase will also be adjusted.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau Repairs Major Roads in Dachang</h3>
<p>The Changzhong Road is the only thoroughfare from the Dachang Airfield to the urban area. The road, which extends more than six kilometers from Tianlu Road to the airfield, is frequently damaged due to heavy vehicle traffic. In view of this, the Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau invited tenders for construction in April of this year. Construction has recently begun and is expected to be completed by mid-November. However, because the road is a macadam surface, the required materials are not easy to find on the market. The bureau has negotiated with the Shanghai Gas Company to purchase 100 tons of asphalt. When the entire road is completed, vehicle traffic will definitely be convenient.</p>

<h3>Xu Shentang's Birthday Celebration Aids Education</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's reader scholarship fund received a generous donation of 30,000 yuan from Mr. Xu Guanqun of the Xinya Weaving Factory yesterday. It is said that Mr. Xu's father recently celebrated his 70th birthday, and he strongly advocated against extravagance. In addition to distributing the gifts from relatives and friends to charitable organizations, he transferred 30,000 yuan to our newspaper's scholarship fund. His kindness is deeply appreciated. Mr. Liang Bingqian wrote: Dear Sir, My friend Mr. Guo Zhaochang previously completed a certain transaction with the help of intermediaries, and Mr. Guo said, "[Please have a simple meal to express my gratitude]." Unexpectedly, a letter arrived yesterday, saying, "[You are busy, I am afraid you will not have time to attend, so I respectfully offer a check for 5,000 yuan.]" At a time of crisis, material resources are scarce and we should be frugal. How can I enjoy such a lavish meal? Have you not heard of "[Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine rot; on the roads, there are corpses of those who died of starvation.]" Those with compassion cannot allow this! Therefore, I dare to use this opportunity to donate the original check for 5,000 yuan to your newspaper's scholarship fund, not daring to claim it as a good deed, but actually creating blessings for Mr. Guo. Not only will the students benefit greatly, but I will also be grateful.] According to Mr. Guo and Mr. Liang, one is mindful of the source of water, and the other does not take wealth unscrupulously, which are both commendable and valuable. This is written to express gratitude. The scholarship fund received yesterday included 30,000 yuan transferred from the Xu Shentang birthday celebration, 6,600 yuan from colleagues at the Huamei Tobacco Factory, 6,000 yuan from Xiao Rulie (refunded scholarship), 5,000 yuan from Guo Zhaochang (delivered by Mr. Liang Bingqian), 2,000 yuan from Shen Zhongxian, 1,600 yuan from colleagues on Changbai Street in Huangpu District, 1,000 yuan each from layman Jin Su and Pang Benzhang, and 400 yuan (found items) from the Star Grand Theater.

<h3>Symposium on Elementary School Education</h3>
<p>This newspaper held a symposium on education in universities and middle schools on the 4th and 6th of this month to discuss the general guidelines for improving education. At 4:00 p.m. on the 8th of this month, a symposium on elementary school education was held at the conference hall of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The attendees were Liu Huiyuan, Zheng Baozhang, Yao Shaoxiu, Zhang Xinbo, Shen Xibin, Gong Jiachang, Chen Hongbi, Wu Ruoan, Ding Yixin, Kong Yunfu, Yu Shumin, Xu Zichang, and Lu Zhaohai, Mr. Hu Weiqing. The chairman was still Mr. Huang Jingwan, director of the Social Service Department of this newspaper. The main points of the symposium are recorded as follows: Huang Jingwan: Elementary school is the basic education of the nation. Whether the education received is good or not is enough to affect one's life and conduct in a small way, and it is related to the strength of the country in a large way. Therefore, advanced countries attach importance to elementary school education no less than to universities and middle schools, because the education received in childhood leaves the deepest impression. [You reap what you sow]. With good seeds, you will naturally get good results. You have been engaged in elementary school education for a long time and have experience. You must have unique insights on the current problems of elementary school education, what should be promoted, what should be reformed, and how to improve it. Today, our newspaper is holding a symposium for elementary school teachers. We are grateful for your presence. Please express your opinions freely. Huang Jingwan: The pathological state of education is now a major problem that needs to be remedied urgently. The biggest crux of the problem lies in the instability of teachers' lives. In this extraordinary period, the lives of those in the education field are unspeakably difficult, especially elementary school teachers. While teaching at school, they are worried about firewood, rice, oil, and salt at home, and they cannot concentrate their energy, so they are perfunctory. Therefore, the current situation of the education field can be said to be in crisis. Today, our newspaper is holding a symposium. Please give your opinions on this issue. As far as this newspaper is concerned, we have always been sympathetic to elementary school teachers. At the same time, we have jobs such as subsidies for teachers and staff and medical assistance to fulfill our service duties. Gong Jiachang: Regarding the improvement of the lives of elementary school teachers, the main thing is to increase salaries. The economic situation of each school is different, and the salaries of teachers also vary greatly. Our school (Ningbo Luhai Elementary School) recently submitted a salary increase to the school board, and it is unlikely to be disappointed. In addition, there are two other methods: ○Fundraising. ○The school board runs scholarships to reward outstanding and poor students. Personally, I would like to offer a few suggestions: ○The economic situation of each school should be made public, and more than 70% of the total income should be distributed to teachers and staff. ○The media should advocate for the municipal authorities to find ways to increase special rations for education colleagues, and to increase the rationing of daily necessities in addition to rice. ○Organize production loans for the families of teachers and staff so that the families of teachers can engage in side businesses. Wu Ruoan: According to the regulations of the authorities, schools should allocate 70% of the tuition fees to teachers and make the economy as fair as possible. Our school (Nanyang Girls' Elementary School) has implemented the public system for three years and gives 100% of the tuition fees to teachers. As for office expenses such as water and electricity, they are all taken from miscellaneous fees, which will never affect the lives of teachers. The tuition fee for this semester has increased by about four times compared to the previous semester, but the income of employees has also increased by four times. Therefore, although the lives of the employees of our school are difficult, everyone can share the joys and sorrows and maintain education. Chen Hongbi: Our school (Guangdong Elementary School) has adopted an open economic system since its establishment in the first year of the Republic of China. We distribute 95% of the tuition fees to employees and issue several months of salary at the beginning of the semester to stabilize the lives of teachers. Wu Ruoan: Recently, a student from our school (Nanyang Girls' Elementary School) brought a letter from the section chief of the Works Bureau, requesting free tuition based on the qualifications of civil servants' children. Although the Education Bureau has expressed the principle of free tuition for civil servants' children, the implementation methods have not been announced. Our school also has free tuition methods, with free tuition reaching 100,000 yuan per semester. Before receiving the Education Bureau's methods, it seems inconvenient to accept the above-mentioned matters, otherwise, it will reduce the school's income and indirectly affect the lives of teachers. I wonder if other schools have encountered the same situation? Shen Xibin: Regarding this point, our school (Chongshi Elementary School) has also encountered it. As far as I know, the Education Bureau's principle is: [Children of low-level civil servants are exempted from paying part of the tuition fee], but the standard for [low-level] and [part] should be determined by the Education Bureau, and the application and investigation procedures should also be handled by the Education Bureau. Kong Yunfu: A student's parent even brought a letter to our school requesting a refund. Huang Jingwan: In short, the education cause is not only a problem for schools and teachers, but the government and society should also take responsibility. As it is now, the efforts made by the authorities in education seem to be too little. Huang Jingwan: This newspaper has been running student aid funds for seven sessions, and the amount of student aid funds received has been increasing in each session. This certainly shows the society's sympathy for students, but as the number of applications increases each session, we also feel the difficulty of distribution. Our newspaper pays equal attention to the four factors of physical fitness, family background, academic performance, and moral character of the applicants. We are grateful for the cooperation of the schools. Now, please give your valuable opinions on the application procedures or the methods of selection. Gong Jiachang: The selection criteria should be [poverty-based]. Although reporting is effective, it is ultimately a method after the fact. It is best to find ways to prevent it before it happens. When handling the application procedures, a detailed investigation must be carried out first, but the investigation is complicated and cannot be done without a large number of staff. In my opinion, high-grade students can be selected to take on this work. After each session, each student who receives assistance should be interviewed individually during a semester, and the interview records should be used as the selection criteria for the next session. Then the review of the next session will be easier to handle. Chen Hongbi: Regarding the review, if it is only based on the report card, it is often unreliable. According to my past experience in handling student aid funds for the Guangdong Alumni Association, many schools often cheat for students, issue fake diplomas, fill in fake scores, and deceive for profit. Your newspaper's method is to have the schools where they are studying recommend them and then conduct a selection test to prevent deception and ensure that the donations are used where they should be. This is admirable. As for the school, it is still a moral issue. Zheng Baozhang: Our school (Jingan Temple Elementary School) responds to the student aid movement, and the whole school sets a 10% free quota. In addition, the school board sets up five scholarships to provide students with book fees for students receiving assistance from Shenbao, Xinwenbao, and the Municipal Education Bureau. After 3 p.m., we use spare time and classrooms to run voluntary schools. Now there is a suggestion that the number of application forms issued by your newspaper to schools for recommendation should be limited to 5% of the total number of students in the school. This kind of restriction should be determined according to the status of each school. For example, in schools in high-end residential areas, most of the students' families are wealthy, and often there are no 5% of the students in the whole school who need to apply. On the contrary, in some areas, 5% of the application forms are not enough. Therefore, please consider the handling of your newspaper. Huang Jingwan: This newspaper welcomes your suggestions very much. The following turns to page 4</p>

<h3>Symposium on Elementary School Education</h3>
<p>Continued from page 3 Huang Jingwan: Elementary school students are the future masters of the country. The health of elementary school students is greatly related to the prosperity and strength of the country. In this time of difficult living, maintaining health is really not easy, but the school should always take care as much as possible to protect this group of national seedlings. Xu Zichang: This problem is fundamentally in the business problem, but in such an era, talking about business is probably not easy to fit the actual situation. Since the root cause cannot be achieved in the treatment, I would like to contribute a few superficial views on the symptomatic aspects: ○ The school and teachers should promote good cleaning habits. ○ Your newspaper should run a circulating doctor. In the past, the Health Bureau often sent staff to schools to inject preventive injections and vaccinations, but now they often cannot be popularized. I hope that your newspaper will promote this and popularize this work. Zheng Baozhang: Hygiene habits are very important. Our school, Jingan Elementary School, has always attached great importance to it: ○ Morning exercises, limiting students to arrive at school before 8 am, the first class is set as morning exercises, which has great effects. ○ Cleaning inspection. Today's elementary school students are often thin and easily infected with diseases such as pulmonary tuberculosis. Our school is responsible for checking by the class teachers of each grade. Once a disease state is found, the parents are immediately reminded to send them to the doctor for treatment. Those with poor family conditions are immediately asked social groups to provide free diagnosis and treatment. The health of elementary school students is really too related to the health of the nation. Xu Zichang: Regarding the cleanliness and hygiene of children's lives, we should first pay attention to the habits of families and parents, but the responsibilities of the school are no less than those of the family. Infectious diseases such as meningitis, typhoid fever, and tuberculosis are easily spread in schools with a large number of people, incomplete equipment, and crowded school buildings. For example, crowded classrooms, space and area that do not meet the standards, and poor air circulation should all be the responsibility of the school. Often, many schools ask elementary school students to work outside of class to do sweeping, pouring sputum pots, wiping blackboards, etc. As a result, the tender bodies of elementary school students are greatly harmed. Therefore, I advocate abolishing this system. Each school should have at least two workers who are in charge of cleaning matters. Shen Xibin: At the same time, I feel that the lack of children's entertainment venues in this city, such as public playgrounds and children's parks, has no impact on children's health. The Municipal Park is now hoping to set up more children's parks and sports fields in each district. This time, Nanyang Hospital provided free physical examinations for the students who received assistance from the elementary school group of this newspaper, which is also a help for the health of elementary school students. I hope that all teachers will inform the students that they should go to the examination according to the scheduled schedule with the free examination certificate issued by this newspaper, and not miss the opportunity. Xu Zichang: In addition to good cleaning habits, good exercise habits are also very important. Gong Jiachang: Before the children's park can be opened up, it is best to allow elementary school students to enter the park for free. The current park is too aristocratic! In addition, I think that the improvement of curriculum standards and teaching methods also directly or indirectly affects children's health. Xu Zichang: General schools only value recitation. I think that except for a part of the Chinese class that needs to be read carefully, all other courses should not adopt the recitation method. Schools and teachers should never cater to the psychology of parents and make students [read books to death, read dead books, and die from reading books]. Huang Jingwan: From the habits of elementary school students, I think of the problem of children's extracurricular life. [Those who are near vermilion are red, and those who are near ink are black]. Children's very pure minds are easily affected by the so-called [alley education] if they are not properly guided. Each school has some special methods for guiding the life of elementary school students. You may wish to provide more. Yu Shumin: Most families in Shanghai do not pay much attention to family education, and it is difficult for schools to contact families. It is best for schools to extend the time for leaving school so that elementary school students can do more homework, singing and entertainment under the supervision of teachers. Especially important is that children should be absolutely prohibited from reading comic books. Chen Hongbi: Just like the lack of children's parks, there seem to be only a few children's libraries in this city, and the publication of children's books can be said to be almost non-existent. In addition to hoping that schools will provide more guidance, I also hope that the publishing industry will pay attention to this issue. Wu Ruoan: Our school adopts a class meeting system to organize elementary school students. In addition, we hold lectures, entertainment parties, and various competitions, which are guided by the class teachers. Xu Zichang: In my opinion, the current elementary school students in each school can be said to have [no life outside of class]. Schools pay too much attention to dead knowledge and too little attention to art. I advocate that schools should have at least a training committee, which often meets to study students' extracurricular and off-campus life. In student organizations, the Baojia compilation method is a very worthwhile method to adopt. In this way, with organization and guidance, we can achieve [truth, goodness, and beauty] and [hand, brain, and heart] education. Huang Jingwan: Now, please express your high opinions on the quantitative promotion and qualitative improvement of compulsory elementary schools in Shanghai. Xu Zichang: The biggest difficulty in running compulsory schools is the school building. I hope that each school can make more use of the time and space of leaving school. Wu Ruoan: Even if the school building problem is solved, the current power saving is also a serious problem. Huang Jingwan: In addition to night schools, I hope to set up more morning schools to help out-of-school children by using the energetic morning. Wu Ruoan: The biggest problem seems to be the problem of life. Without enough food and clothing, how can we talk about studying? Children who are young cannot afford to go to school because their parents cannot afford it. Children who are older stop studying because they help their parents earn money. Therefore, children have to throw away their books and pick up rice bags to sell rice or do small business. Zheng Baotong: In the families of poor people, it is certainly painful for children to drop out of school, but they have to take care of greater pain and resolutely stop studying. When our school first started an informal school, the number of children who came to study was very small because they thought that dropping out of school was not the greatest pain. Huang Jingwan: Therefore, in addition to hoping that each school will establish informal schools, we also hope that each factory, each union, and each professional group will promote and run informal schools to help this group of vast out-of-school children. Huang Jingwan: Now, please feel free to express your opinions. Zheng Baotong: The most important thing for elementary school students is moral education. If there is no profound and correct moral concept on the innocent and pure heart, then the next generation of the country is very difficult to be optimistic about. Chen Hongbi: The problem is still the cultivation of elementary school teachers. Huang Jingwan: Therefore, we hope that elementary school teachers will organize study groups. Shen Xibao: There is a very serious problem. Please criticize fairly from the standpoint of the media. I always feel that education should be a matter for the country, but the authorities in our country, especially the education authorities in this city, have not made the greatest efforts in education. It is said that the education funds in Nanjing and Hangzhou account for more than 20% of the municipal funds, but this city is the economic center of the country with rich tax revenue, and what is actually allocated for education, I don't know how many thousandths of it accounts for? Even in terms of the subsidy for private schools, it has only been issued for March and April, but the teachers cannot only eat meals for March and April! From various aspects, I really doubt the authorities' concern for the education field. Ding Yixin: Therefore, our greatest hope is that politics can get on the right track. Huang Jingwan: I am very honored to have everyone express their opinions today.</p>
<h3>Guanshengyuan Will Hold a Charity Sale of Mid-Autumn Mooncakes Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Divided into Student Loan Funds and Poverty Relief Funds Guanshengyuan Food Company's products, such as candy, biscuits, preserved tangerine peel, and preserved plums, have long been popular, especially the Mid-Autumn mooncakes, which are the best in Shanghai. This Mid-Autumn Festival, in response to student aid and relief of the poor, many extra-large mooncakes are made for a charity sale. All the proceeds will be donated to the student aid fund and poverty relief fund of this newspaper and the student loan fund of Xinwenbao for sponsorship. The mooncakes are of excellent quality, with edible colors and mixed sugar powder on the surface to form artistic patterns, and are decorated with edible sugar beads, which are generous and beautiful. The divisions are: [Peaceful Years] each box is sold for 10,000 yuan, [Cloud Dress Fairy Moon] each box is sold for 9,000 yuan, [Three Pools Mirroring the Moon] each box is sold for 6,000 yuan. It is expected that all sales will generate 200,000 yuan, which will last for ten months, from September 17th to 26th. The charity sale mooncakes will be displayed in the window of the company on Nanjing Road starting tomorrow. It is expected that many people will be enthusiastic about charity and will be eager to participate. You can get exquisite gifts to decorate the festival, and you can also get the opportunity to help students and relieve poverty. It is really a win-win situation. We hope that all sectors of society will support and promote the event.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Xu's Birthday Banquet Funds Maternity Assistance</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Yunnan wrote in a letter: [I would like to inform you that a few days ago, it was my wife Xu Shiyi's 50th birthday. My children originally planned to celebrate and express our family's joy. However, considering that the time of birth is originally a day to commemorate the difficulty of the mother, at this time of high prices and food shortages, the masses are waiting to be fed. How dare we disturb relatives and friends and do anything that would increase our guilt? However, if we fail to live up to the kindness of relatives and friends, we also feel uneasy. Therefore, we will donate 10,000 yuan from the funds for the banquet on this day to the poor women's maternity assistance fund hosted by your office as a blessing to relatives and friends. I know that it is only a drop in the bucket and cannot help the righteous cause, but in this chaotic and difficult world, frugality and abstinence from killing may also be allowed by the benevolent. I am enclosing a check for 10,000 yuan, and I hope that you will check and issue a receipt.]</p>
<h3>Request to Benevolent Gentlemen to Donate for Printing "The Law of Preserving Wealth"</h3>
<p>"The Law of Preserving Wealth" written by Layman Nie Yuntai has been popular since its publication and remains so. Just yesterday, the Shanghai Raincoat Factory purchased one thousand copies, valued at ten thousand yuan. Both previous printings of this book were made possible by donations from Master Ku Qi. Now, there are fewer than a hundred copies remaining, and given the current high cost of paper and printing, a reprint is exceedingly difficult. How can we find a benevolent gentleman like Master Ku Ji, who is willing to spend money to donate for printing, so that this cautionary and virtuous book will not be discontinued? This would truly be a boundless merit.</p>
<h3>A New Interpretation of Mencius Offers Preferential Treatment to Students</h3>
<p>The book "[A New Interpretation of Mencius]" written by Mr. Zhao Zhengping, president of the National Shanghai University, has been published recently. To offer preferential treatment to students of middle and higher schools in this city for purchasing and reading, all school groups should send letters directly to the National Shanghai University at 1623 Datong Road. Those purchasing thirteen or more copies will enjoy a 20% discount. It is advisable for every middle and higher school student to have a copy. It is said that there are not many copies left, so those wishing to purchase should do so quickly. The fixed price is one hundred yuan in national currency per copy.</p>
