<p>東京十日中央社電　日航空部隊九日首次轟炸菲律賓作戰敵策源地阿特米拉的，並對策應菲律賓作戰之敵大型械集結地摩羅泰島，施以猛轟，同時並奇襲敵陸上大型機及敵戰略基地新幾內亞島馬爾敵機場，各役均曾予敵以重創，（一）日航空部隊八日上午四時頃，冒極惡劣天氣，强襲摩羅泰敵機場，冒熾烈之防禦砲火，向沿走路及地上設施等投下巨彈，炸燬其設施四處後，即安然返防。（二）日航空部隊九日下午三時頃，急襲羅斯內哥羅斯島哈恩機場，痛炸停放機場上之敵大型中型機五十餘架，除炸燬其中三十餘架外，並使其設施八處起火焚燒，當時敵高射砲火雖極熾烈，惟日方於確認上項戰果後，仍能安全飛返。（三）日航空部隊九日上午三時半頃，急襲新幾內亞島馬爾機場，置敵猛烈高射砲火，猛施轟炸，使其設施數處起火焚燒。</p>
<h3>暴風吹襲雷伊泰　陸上戰況無變化　卡里加拉美軍已陷孤立</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十日中央社電　雷伊泰島日美兩軍陸上決戰，仍無重大變化，僅有局地激烈戰鬥而已，日軍利用時機，使敵潰退，且敵亦已承認以上事實，茲誌其廣播大意如次：卡里加拉方面之戰鬥極爲激烈，五日美軍第二十四師團一部，被携有戰車及汽車之日軍包圍，遭受猛攻，結果使美軍陷於孤立，美軍奮戰至最後，逃出者僅五名而已。</p>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　據紐約來電，美從軍記者九日報吿雷伊泰戰况如次：沿奧爾莫克公路一帶之戰塲，今日有時速百英里之暴風，美軍之作戰及接濟，均受打擊，更因一日軍之激烈進攻，已形成惡戰狀態。比那莫伯安附近，日軍最優秀第一綫部隊，向美軍進攻，美軍損害甚大，因暴風關孫，最前綫美軍幾乎斷絕接濟，彼等已不得不節約彈藥，甚至有一部似已缺乏食糧。九日之麥克沃塞軍戰况公報，亦謂該方面雖有暴風，但戰事仍極熾烈，更一謂日軍砲火極爲正確。</p>
<p>中部太平洋基地十日中央社電　培里琉島之敵軍，逐次增强砂袋陣地，向中央高地方面日軍陣地推進，進展極爲綏慢，士氣亦甚頹萎，該島戰事沉寂，並無何等變化。</p>
<h3>菲對不逞份子　決依令嚴懲</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十日中央社電　菲政府希遜內長，頃以洛勒爾戒嚴令代理司令官資格，致電各戒嚴地區戒嚴司令官，令對有企圖擾亂反叛利敵行爲之不逞份子，依據戒嚴令從嚴處罰。</p>
<h3>德報盛讃　山下大將</h3>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　日陸軍省發表任命山下奉文大將爲菲律賓方面陸單最高指揮官後，因該大將乃馬來半島電擊戰之名將，深爲德國民衆敬仰，故德國朝野對將軍之期待頗股，各報均大事揭載，尤其德國民衆報，九日於報端盛加讚辭如次：由山下奉文大將被任爲菲島最高陸軍司令官，可見日軍首腦部對菲律賓戰事之重要，山下大將乃馬來作戰之勝利者，新加坡作戰之政府者，無疑乃今日日本之第一級軍人，大將具有特殊之統率力及組織之才能，並有豐富之軍事知識及世界無匹之豪瞻，想必能指揮若定，予敵軍莫大打擊也。</p>
<h3>日井口部長　重要談話　孰爲侵略國</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日政府情報局井口第三部長，十日會見外人記者團時，對於斯達林議長於革命二十七周紀念日講演中所呼之「日本爲侵略國」一點，宣稱如次：斯達林議長，於革命紀念日講演中，呼日本爲侵略國，但於此演說中，並無可認爲蘇聯對日政策有何變化之點。凡明瞭日美開戰前之日美交涉經過者，恐皆不會認爲日本爲侵略者也，此事實乃日本政府藉屢次之聲明及宣言向中外闡明者。日本係於英美强力壓迫之下，不得已而動干戈，對於緬甸，菲律賓之予以獨立，即爲日本解放東亞之實證，日本並非侵略者之事實，即敵國方面亦行承認，如英生產部長里特爾頓六月二十日之演說，即曾謂美國之所以被捲入戰禍中，說來頗爲奇妙，蓋美國刺激日本，結果日本不得已對美國加以攻擊。今日東亞被解放之各國家，各民族，已逐漸獲得其獨立與主權，爲共同福社，正互相提携，而英美對此則欲再將緬甸與菲</p>
<h3>奇襲珍珠灣情景空軍乘員目擊談</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日每軍省昨日布吿全軍曰，追昇二級之西川航空兵曹長以下五勇士，自前年三月四日第二次奇襲珍珠灣後，不斷於太平洋全域從事偵察活躍，對全面作戰上樹有莫大貢獻，是年八月下句，第二次所羅門海戰時，五勇　担任索敵任務，遭遇敵戰鬥機羣，壯烈戰死。頃據親臨第二次奇襲珍珠灣之役之搭乘員談述當日作戰之情况如次：當日吾等之一切準備均已就緒後，體重之飛行艇亦安然浮下太平洋風浪之上，旋離水飛起，歷數小時，夜深已近，四日上午即將接近促法島，此際敵方於何時何地起而迎擊，實難預料，故吾人之緊張達於極點，不久促法島出現眼前，天佑促法島附近晴朗一如常日，萬里無雲，滿天朗月，飛抵促法島上空時，吾等於月光下相與祝禱曰：此次奇襲必吿成功，迨將飛入珍珠灘上空時，敵方探照燈之光芒斜穿，透光射上，天空光芒之數眼見增加，即由珍珠灣軍港海面之上，亦射出無數光芒，先鋒飛艇悠悠到達珍珠軍港上空，見得東南海軍工廠收容之艦艇咨影，常對之投以巨彈，地上立即噴出熾烈之炸裂火燄，斯時敵軍高射砲亦接踵射入天空，當其他飛艇部隊突人珍珠軍港時，天空之大半已被暗雲遮蔽，飛艇部隊從容盤一旋，而爲向海軍工廠投下必中巨彈，再度飛返，作三度進攻，敵方之反擊雖然熾烈，但三度進攻時，軍港上空之一角，忽然濃雲中分一縫，乃行飛入如意投以必中彈，完成任務，悠悠而歸，是役日方飛艇毫無損失，亦無敵機之反攻，吾人之空襲更見面滿。</p>
<p>代論</p>
<h3>出席第九次諮詢會誌感</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>本市市政諮詢委員會，昨天舉行第九次全體會議，簡單消息，已在各報披露。我認爲對於市民更有較詳說明之必要。爰就所知，抒述如次：</p>
<p>本次會議中，市府報告，有兩事較爲重要：</p>
<p>（一）關於戶口米價格問題，最近自每斗三百五十元加至五百元，實爲不得已之舉，如照收買成本計算，超過五百元很多，因此每月市府賠累戶口米差額數量相當龐大。現在經市府當局的努力，以及中儲當局的協助，已獲彌補辦法，不致再加配價。同時，可以欣幸的，今後戶口米配給已有着落，不致再有脫期。因此，諮詢會同人及市府當局在這次會上，希望今年國曆及農曆年關不致加價。外間傳說的戶口米脫期配給之說，都是謠言，希望市民了解，不必恐慌，致爲造謠米贏所乘。</p>
<p>（二）市稅整理委員會，經一個多月的努力初步整頓後，稍有成績，如最近軍警經費的增加，雖不能十分滿意，可是，從而證明如能整理得法，成績定必可觀，市財政即能逐漸充裕。不過，市民方面亦須協助，譬如不逃避納稅義務，如發現稅員作弊，隨時吿發，才能得到更好的結果。我想市民已經認識，市財政充裕，治安經費就可增加，治安從而確立，那末，今日盡了納稅義務，明日就可以確保地方治安，也就是確保自己的生命財產了。</p>
<p>此外，討論議案，較爲重要者有三點：</p>
<p>（一）關於收回中央市塲，牲畜市場，魚市塲等，按中央市塲目前的營業範圍，漸漸超越範圍，以致流弊百出，譬如中國藥品與錫箔，亦歸中央市塲經銷。其次，如蔬菜市價，在市民立場以觀，實有人爲的逐漸提高趨勢，使人民痛苦，其實，菜蔬旣不在統制範圍，又非軍需用品，早應改變管理辦法，以適應人民福利。即使有一部分供給軍需，但經改變管理辦法以後，仍無妨礙的。聽說盟邦常局已屢有交還管理表示，當然是盟邦的賢明舉措，希望從速實現。試舉一例，物價管理應有統一辦法，而過去中央市場的物價，每每單獨處理，使人民受很多不必要的痛苦，所以，我們主張可以由中國人單獨辦理的事業，應該讓中國人自辦。希望市府根據各方面請求，從速交涉收回。</p>
<p>（二）本市公務警務敎職人員提高待遇問題，諮詢會屢次鑒於市府屬員薪津，距離生活需要標準太遠，數四建議。我們知道市府當局對於屬員待遇提高問題，亦很關心和重視，並不亞於諮詢會同人。可是，限於市財政的收入，只能逐漸調整。此次諮詢會建議從速設置「市府屬員生活津貼調整委員會」，會同市稅整理委員會根據生活必需品物價指數，合理規定津貼數目，逐漸達到生活津貼與生活費用相符的程度。在市民立場，對於市府屬員爲地方服務，自應全力負擔其生活，縱使整稅以後仍嫌不敷，即增稅亦很願意。因此，希望市府一方面勉勵公務人員爲地方悉心服務，一方面對冗員盡量裁汰。</p>
<p>（三）提高娛樂稅問題，本月七日本報短評即會主張跑狗場回力球場增加門券，悉充市府捐稅，法商跑狗場竟有反對的態度，這是法商極爲不智之舉，我們認爲跑狗原是不必要的。如果一定要跑狗，則娛樂稅就不能不徵收，希望市府不必顧慮，斷然處置，達到徵收目的。</p>
<h3>日海軍武官長　湊少將繼任　近藤中將轉任軍令部</h3>
<p>上海日本在勤海軍武官長近藤中將，奉本月七日令，轉任軍令部，近將離滬。按近藤中將任上海在勤海軍武官長，迄今已一年又二月，中國人士間，頗多知己，性情溫和，對中國有深刻認識及同情，此次離滬，各方皆有惜別之情。</p>
<p>繼任者湊慶讓少將，已於昨（十）日在海軍武官府就職。</p>
<p>湊慶讓氏略歷</p>
<p>湊慶讓少將，現年四十九歲，大正五年卒業於海軍兵學校，屢在中國方面服務，昭和七年以後任中國方面艦隊參謀，其後歷任上海·福州·厦門等地海軍武官。大東亞戰爭初期，任航空母艦艦長，活躍南方前綫，復經兵備局第二課長及兵學校敎官而出任現職。</p>
<p>發表就職談話</p>
<p>湊慶讓少將於就職後向日僑發表談話云：「余此次奉調至中國服務，在此次決戰階段中從事新職務，無任欣幸。本人因與僑胞諸君在各方面皆有密切關係，於執行職務時，尚望諸君指導與協助。</p>
<p>至於我人於此決戰態勢下應有之心情，端在致力打破任何困難，以期完遂擊滅英美之偉業。際此一重大時代，尤所切望者，即對本身之職責及他人，皆須熱誠，且常須從容不一英國於鄧扣克大敗後，陷於重大危機，其時英國內務大臣莫里遜曾吿其國民曰：「有勇氣與熱誠者，絕對不敗。」此語雖出諸敵口，亦爲我人所應切記者，日爲擊滅如斯敵國，較彼更爲從容不迫，信係必要。但願悉能本此心情，貫澈始終。」</p>

<p>東京十日中央社電　寺內南方陸軍最高指揮官，前爲表彰拉孟守備隊長金光惠次郎少佐之偉勳，曾以最高指揮官資格頒以名譽褒狀。日陸軍省發表：爲紀念該部隊長功績，榮昇二級，爲陸軍大佐</p>
<h3>空襲巴克羅特　敵指揮官陣亡</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十日中央社電　日航空部隊曾於七日晨迎擊來襲巴克羅特之敵B24型機二十五架，當擊落其三架，擊毀四架，並擊落其新銳機二架，可見敵攻擊指揮官戰死，事屬確實，並於是夜轟炸摩羅一泰島，使該機場二處起火受重創。</p>

<h3>西綫三焦點　大戰進行中　渡摩塞爾河美軍被殲</h3>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　西綫戰局今又再度緊迫化，據傳該戰綫與南翼之法國東部·亞琛附近，及最北翼之荷蘭三戰區，刻正展開激戰中。巴頓麾下之美第三軍，自八日晨以來，即以薩爾盆地爲目標，發動一大攻勢，并更增援三師向法國束部洛林，梅茲兩側進攻，同時德軍之抵抗亦極猛烈，各處將敵軍作戰企圖予以粉碎，尤以鼓塔姆松東北地區及夏特薩朗西方與美軍以重創。亞琛地區德軍反攻，戰事更形熾烈。</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　海通社訊：西綫南部之美軍，已在摩松·與萊因——馬納運河之間，開始大規模之攻勢，在此區內美軍數師，具有空軍與大砲協助，及一切技術上之便利，攻勢頗盛，德方早已偵得美軍集中勁旅，待機而動，德軍長官業已從事必要之準備，因此抗戰之力至爲堅強。亞琛之四週，亦有集中軍隊運輸軍械之情事，不久亦有一番大戰之可能，美軍已開始施放烟幕彈。</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電德國社訊：美軍於星期三薄暮，經短時之準備砲火後，在南盧森堡區三處據點越過摩塞爾河，當時德軍立即發動反攻，而殲滅渡河之美軍，僅較小之敵軍殘部逃回至河之對岸</p>
<h3>義境反軸心軍　發動攻勢</h3>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　義大利戰綫近已脫離膠着狀態’英第八軍於亞平寗山脈東部及亞特里亞海方面開始廣大範圍之攻擊，一方美第五軍亦正準備作戰中。</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　海通社訊：英第八軍在亞特里亞海岸區，於數日前開始進攻加西亞諾迤北區域，現仍在酣戰中，以賽森納福里公路爲爭奪重點。英軍在該處隆柯河西岸橋頭堡所集中之軍隊甚多，英軍先以大砲猛轟歷時甚久，乃向福里挺進，其後遭遇德軍堅强反攻，仍退至隆柯河。英第八軍左翼繼欲突入福里與法安柴間之平原，結果亦被德軍堅强抵抗所挫敗。今英第八軍沿亞平寗向西北推進之攻勢，是否志在打斷法安柴波倫亞一綫內之德軍，或僅係牽制波平原東角一帶之德軍，則尚待後觀。</p>
<h3>襲英新兵器　Ｖ二號之性能</h3>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電德元首行營九日正午發表：對倫敦之攻擊，八日來之Ｖ二號繼續轟炸。</p>

<h3>德民族顯示毅力　必能應付艱難　郭培爾發表論文</h3>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　海通社訊：德宣傳部長郭培爾在「德國週刊」發表論文，略稱，目前之戰事可以澄清局勢，奠定未來之基礎，戰後依然生存者必係優勢份子。德人對於各國已有新認識，生死問題眞相畢露，假面具已揭穿，吾人不再受愚矣。依照適者生存之定例，優秀者必然生存，德國民衆已顯示其應付艱難之能力，而缺乏此項能力之國家，必然陷入黑暗之深淵。德國之堅定德性，不僅由於國民性之穩健，亦國家與社會機構之功效。</p>
<h3>保衛東普魯士　軍民總力戰　洪京男子撤退</h3>

<p>柏林十日中央社電　海通社訊二東綫蘇軍倘欲進攻東普魯士柯尼斯堡一帶，里巴方而之德軍將加以威脅，因此蘇軍或將進攻里巴亦未可知。蘇軍在立陶宛區域已集中大軍，德軍亦已嚴密警戒矣。冬季大攻勢，將於米美爾至喀爾巴阡山全綫發動，蘇軍進攻東普魯士之際，將同時進攻波蘭，蘇聯顯欲於嚴冬降臨前獲致勝利。的薩河中部戰況益趨激烈，蘇車企圖抄襲洪京東南之德軍陣地，但被擊退</p>
<p>洪京十日中央社電　海通社訊：當局敦促貝斯特區男子自動撤退後，洪京情形仍極鎭靜。</p>
<h3>大批比人處局　五萬失被監禁</h3>
<p>日內瓦十日中央社電　德國社訊：據白魯塞爾消息：比利時司法部長於星期三在比利時國會內宣稱，所謂叛徒九百人，因與德軍合作而已被處決，渠繼稱，另有嫌疑犯五萬六千人已被監禁。</p>

<p>廣西前綫十日中央社電鬱江柳江中間地帶，遭受夾攻之渝軍，由於日軍南方迂迴部隊之巧妙作戰，已陷入重圍。更因日軍後續部隊之壓縮進攻，而呈現潰滅狀態，緣龍山圩方面之日軍先鋒部隊，於二十五日夜開始向樟木圩，（龍山圩，西水州四公里）方面進攻。六日薄暮，突入該地前面渝軍據點之黃嶺，又佔領寺石寺石圩西北約二十五公里）之盤口，（平安東方）等渝軍據點。同時中里圩方面日軍，於該日攻陷石磨（來賓西南三十公里）一，七日拂曉自三方面開始進攻云·</p>
<p>完成夾擊柳州態勢</p>
<p>廣日中央社電據廣西日軍前綫基地電，日軍對桂林城開始總攻後，即與渝第卅一軍展開激戰，同時日軍之猛攻柳州作戰，於八日以來更熾烈，較衡陽之役尤甚。日軍已於八日晨佔領柳州東北廿五公里之雒容，並與另一隊日軍，猛攻柳州附近渝軍外廓陣地，展開肉搏戰。又由華南北上之日軍，於六日佔領象縣後，猛撲柳州，而確立南北夾攻之態勢。渝軍守備柳州主力爲六十二軍及獨立戰車團，並由南寗方面調來砲兵部隊，企圖實行總反攻。副參謀長白崇禧，第四戰區司令張發奎親自督戰。技桂林與柳州均爲美駐渝空軍基地，故美機之前來援助，乃屬當然，以期繼續維持抗戰。因此柳州之役，可謂此次大陸最大激戰，而日軍充分發揮實力，予以重創。</p>
<p>廣州十日中央社電　據柳州前綫日軍電，日軍於象縣附近，渡過柳江後，一路向柳州猛撲，排除渝軍頑攻，於九日下午四時廿分，攻入柳州機塲東端。旋於五時，將其完全佔領，刻日軍正向市街中心部隊猛攻中。</p>
<p>廣西前綫十日中央社電　日軍某部隊八日晨，佔領雊容後，九日晨更排除據守高領塘，（柳州東北八公里），三閉江，（柳州東北十公里），附近防衛柳州之渝第六十二軍及野砲部隊之抵抗，於柳州東北方地區渝軍外廓陣地，展開激烈戰中。又另一日軍部隊，迫近長塘墟（柳州北方十五公里），現正在縮柳州之包圍圈</p>
<p>華南前綫日軍某基地十日中央社電　日軍挺進部隊，自六日攻佔象縣後，即强行渡越柳江，繼績向西北方進攻，刻已達距河點若干公里之地帶。又攻陷武宜之日軍各部隊更，於九日上午十時三十分，突入柳州西南約七十公里之來賓，繼續渡過武江，確保高地一帶，控扼渝軍之退路。按來賓乃柳州之最後據點，直達柳州，日軍北上部隊，業於九日正午到達某地，渡河北顧柳州，向前猛進云。</p>
<p>外電所傳桂省戰況</p>
<p>里期本十日中央社電路透社駐渝特派員，九日就廣西省戰况報道如次：「日軍於戰軍隊掩護下，猛烈進攻桂林郊外渝軍陣綫，於柳州方面，採取包圍態勢。進擊之日軍，刻由北東南三方面前進，北方部隊刻由柳州北方二十七公里公路，直向該市進攻。東方部隊刻進迫柳東北方約二十七公里，湘桂鐵路上之雒容南方部隊，刻渡過柳江，攻擊柳州南方各地。又合衆社特派員更作補充之報道如次：直向柳州方面開始大進擊之日軍，由湘桂鐵路西進，佔領柳州東北方四十八公里之中渡，於此分爲兩隊，一隊進擊柳州北方二十四公里處，另一隊殺至柳城（柳州西北十七公里半）北方十九公里處。據渝軍當局稱，渝軍已阻止日軍部隊之進擊。另一方面，由湘桂鐵路南下，直奔柳州之日軍，已進至雒容外廓，渝軍當局並承認，日軍更由柳州東方七十五公里之處加强壓迫。又日軍由武宣西進亦見進展，此舉顯係日軍爲阻止渝軍由柳州南察街道南下之行動，此部隊前進二十四公里，刻已達柳州西南方十九公里半處。</p>
<h3>福州日軍　擴大佔領區</h3>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　據合衆社駐渝訪員訊稱，渝軍當局，前曾發表東部中國海岸福州地區發生新戰事，日軍刻正擴大佔領地區中。現自福州西進日軍，已到達距離該市十二公里之地點，且正與渝軍交戰中。</p>
<h3>渝方抗議　物資接濟太少</h3>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　德國新聞社訊華盛頓息，反軸心國善後接濟協會理事里蒙，頃於今日發表廣播演說稱，渝方之委員會已向該協會遞一報告，其內容稱渝方由該協會所獲得之物資，實供不應求云。</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統　返白宮秉政</h3>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　德國社訊：羅斯福總統今日返白宮，各街市七民衆擁擠不堪，報以歡　，其聲雷動。反軸心四十四國代表均集中於白宮，除阿根廷外，各南美諸國代表亦與會。羅氏偕友人與記者多人乘特別列車抵華盛頓，轉乘渠汽車抵白宮，其四周均有特務人員予以保護。</p>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　海通社訊：羅斯福總統當選蟬聯總統後，已開始考慮與邱吉爾及斯達林再度會議，及準備將內政計劃送交議會研討之種種問題。民主黨競選雖獲勝利，但議會方面，除少數孤立派參議員等，對未來之內政問題及戰後外交計劃當有陣碍。國務卿赫爾頗有倦勤可能，繼任者或爲史蒂丁尼斯或爲華萊士，勞工部長柏金斯亦有更動可能。</p>
<p>三頭會議即將舉行</p>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　據合衆社華盛頓特派員訊：因羅斯福當選連任，故最近與邱吉爾斯達林之會談亦可確定。此次會談，蓋將討論戰後安全保障機構之從速具體化，就中最重要者，當屬政治爭點，即凡涉及美外交政策之根本問題，與英美蘇三國是否有調和其利害關係至某種程度之問題，當爲討論之重心，實際上英美與蘇聯之利害，將趨對立。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十日中央社電　海通社訊：英相邱吉爾昨在倫教梅育拉爾勛爵之宴會席上，發表演說，對戰時進展遲鈍，表示不滿。並呼籨羅斯福斯達林與其本人，應即舉行另一次會議，並謂三大國須以全力爲之，始能擊潰德國之堅決抵抗，今義大利與荷蘭之戰事，僅爲未來大戰之前奏而已，此將持續數月之久。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十日中央社電　德國社訊，據莫斯科傳來美方消息：蘇聯聞悉羅斯福選舉勝利後，頗表欣慰。合衆社稱，羅斯颺之所以見愛於蘇聯，乃因羅斯福將使美國不致回復孤立主義，普通一般蘇人皆視羅氏爲德黑闌會議中之中心人物，蘇人亦深知恢復美蘇邦交者，爲羅氏之政府。</p>
<p>旅行通信</p>
<h3>客中誌趣</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>記者向居於都市中，實有養尊處優之嫌。兼之曩昔負笈海外多年，又不免染上了一絲的歐化，做了物質文明的信徒。雖自信決非「月亮外國好」者流，但諺云「習慣成自然」，又謂一積重難返」，說來其中頗有一點小道理。</p>
<p>今番記者奉派來南匯鄉間考察農村經濟及社會情况，故有機會在農村中盤桓，而日與鄉民往來，致多年機械式的生活方式，也不得不從此起了變化。初則至不習慣，漸亦泰然處之。由此足證人類是能够適應環境的動物。茲不計繁瑣，將邇來客中發生的趣事數則，提供於本報讀者，聊博一粲而已。</p>
<p>鄉人不識城中物</p>
<p>記者行前，曾蒙友人夏君（設有徽章肆於泰山路中）爲祝我此行工作之順利，特持贈馬蹄形金色小別針一枚，記者爲不負摯友盛意，及已身之使命起見，揷於襟間，用以自勉。因式樣玲巧頗覺新奇，致到此後，連日往鄉間與農民懇談一切，俾知民情隱痛，於每次談話時，鄉民十九注意此小東西，雖當時甚覺納罕，亦終莫名其所以，祗以其少見多怪。及至日前，記者談及擬不日往較遠沿海數處視察時，乃有一農民愼重向記者提出忠告，謂該處治安不靖，君往宜除此徽章，免生枝節，至此記者始恍然大悟，不覺啞然，蓋彼等誤認此爲證章，事近滑稽，但當時其一片熟情，溢於言表，令人感激。</p>
<p>蛋豆羊三補並進</p>
<p>時屆深秋，都市裏的人們，尤其是暴發戶們，又忙着籌劃轉瞬即屆的冬令進補問題，而一般靠薪水過活的呢，恐怕三餐尚處不繼，遑論進補，速營養都無從談起吧！記者並非長富人之氣焰，老實說本身也是後者陣營中的一員，但因從來生平素信「健康即資本」，和我們東方國粹的一句老話「留得靑山在，不怕沒柴燒」，所以平日在力之所及處，總留意自身的營義。此次來鄉，每以時間及環境關係，且各鄉村並無飯店，故祗得就地取材，托臨時招待的居停代購鄉村特產鷄蛋與豆汁及熟羊肉，合而煮之，頃刻可食，其味實覺無窮。至論營養，恐較什麼補針補藥要勝十倍，然代價則僅抵補針補藥十之一耳，此亦旅行中之發明與收獲也。</p>
<p>忙中難得一日閒</p>
<p>記者來南一週，連日走訪近郊農家，廣搜資料，終天東奔西跑，到處亂撞，雖說不無辛苦，但當受到農家們的熱烈而無虛偽的招待，與每念及報人的責任時，精神上却受到不少安慰，早把肉體上所受的痛苦，無形中驅諸九宵雲外了。茲以城區工作暫告段落，不日起稈遠征他鄉，爲候同伴關係，得有一日之閒，乘機一訪南匯的名勝，殊覺快慰。</p>
<p>四朝銀杏遭浩刦</p>
<p>南匯城廂福泉寺旁，有宋代古銀杏樹一株，大可十數合高及十餘丈，樹幹已空。據鄉人云，如值雷雨交加之際，時有火焰從空隙間噴出，且有巨蛇出現，曾一度發生龍虎相爭之決鬥演出。據記者目睹，猶有貓之遺骸，存枝頭上也。該樹昂然獨立，氣概非凡，依記者個人歷來所見之巨樹，除巴黎近郊魯濱遜村中之大樹外，（按此樹碩大燕化，綠葉成蔭，樹枝間曾築有小亭無間，設咖啡座，供遊人憇休，促膝談心。）此爲第二棵，惜此樹本高揷雲霄，易爲城外遊擊隊認作目標，故經人將頂枝悉行鋸去，而今不啻變成一光頭大漢，大樹有知，亦富呼寃不止矣。記者除代樹惋惜外，同時亦感到「樹可千年，人祗朝露」，似宜即時奮鬥，始不負此短促的一生耳。</p>
<p>兩代洪鐘寂無聲</p>
<p>離銀杏大樹僅咫尺間，有福泉寺，係一尼姑隨，寺至小但甚整潔，院中陳列有序，而佛像亦金光燦爛，供案神罩等皆亦一塵不染，可稱佛門淸凈地，較諸上海邑廟之殘牆斷壁，一片瓦礫，凄凉滿目，實不可同日而語。參觀時，衆尼皆在廟前農田中操作，祗餘一帶髮小尼看守，（按此間風俗，幼女來庵依佛，恐六根未凈，日後反悔，故暫准帶髮住庵，仍隨時有還俗之機會。）庵內有一鐘高可及大，係明代遺物，記者舉木槌擬一擊，試聽鐘語，但爲小尼阻止，據謂其發聲甚宏，遠達數十里，際此治安不靖地方多故之秋，每易被人誤會，認作烽火，致此本係黃鐘大呂的龐然大物，竟效金人三械其口，寂靜無聲者，業已多日，記者聞此，實不禁爲洪鐘呌屈，嘆其與銀杏樹，遭同一命運也。</p>

<h3>郭處長　談警務督察　昨日舉行記者例會</h3>
<p>市宣傳處於昨（十日）上午十時，在市府會議室，召開第二十七次記者例會，由市警察局督察處處長郭紹儀，物價評議委員會主任委員徐天深（秘書陳壽蔭代），出席報告，並解答各記者問題。茲分誌報告及解答如次：</p>
<p>郭處長報告</p>
<p>略謂：「本處內部組織分爲事務，調查，視察三科，並另設獎懲督察長室，調全市爲七個督察區，督察區二十四個分局，及郊區七個分局之官警勤務，對於辦理官警之功過事項，力求嚴格與簡速。若劣行有據，以及不盡職責者，均秉公照章處分，決不稍徇情面。除日間派有督察員隨時考察官警勤務，現以冬防將屆，更指派督察員輪流抽查夜間勤務，以防怠忽，並對各分局內部，舉行臨時視察，對應與應革各點，詳爲指示，俾資改進。官警有留難勒索，以及貪污行爲者，除督察員視察所及，隨即檢舉，報由本處懲辦外，且時常接有市民舉發者，亦均經分別派員查實嚴懲。又本處督察員查勤，照章均須穿着制服，並佩帶督察二字之臂章，俾資識別，惟因目標過於明顯，員警在行爲不正當事務時，一見督察員到來。即迅速廻避，故對員警不正當行爲之事實，極鮮查到。因此，將來擬另組便衣督察人員嚴密查察，以整警紀，同時希望市民遇有官警需索時，根據事實，向本處檢舉，必當依法嚴辦，決不偏護，尤盼市民對於不正當之需索，　淸貪污風氣」。報告，各記者即席提出下列問題：</p>
<p>希望檢舉　警察勒索</p>
<p>（一）申報社問：迎來市上警察，每於執行公務之際，明目張膽，公然索詐，有目共睹，　見不鮮，上海爲國際都市，當茲租界收回，警　管理統一自主之時。身負治安重任之警察，竟敢在通衢衆目昭彰之下，悍然納賄。不特貽笑國際，且使貪風日熾，　　蕩然，未稔貴處長有所聞否，請告督檢之策，俾釋羣念。</p>
<p>（二）中華日報問：近來警察在街市勒索，益見變本加厲，尤以天後宮橋堍，每當黑夜北站旅客經過衆多時，常見有警士四五十人之多，在橋堍檢查行人，公然勒需索，請問督察處對於此種現象，曾有所聞否，有無糾糾正辦法？</p>
<p>（中央）社問：警士沿途勒縈，雖經當局三令五申，嚴予禁止，而依然如故，即如市民往來最熱鬧之外灘廣東路至南京路一帶，亦毫無忌憚的公然白畫需索，深夜輪船到埠時尤甚，如此行爲，衛民者適足以擾民，不各當局見到否？有何制裁辦法？</p>
<p>以上三問題，因內容相似，郭處長綜合答覆，略謂對於長警之公然索詐，督察處早有所聞，並嚴予以制裁，每天查實有不　行　　受處罰者，平均有五十人，屢經通令各分局對屬下警士，嚴加約束，督察處並當赴各分局作精神訓話，今後將於天后宮橋等處，多派督察人員巡視，深盼市民於檢舉時，詳述事實，具　實姓名，督察處決嚴守秘密，予告發人種種便利與保障。</p>
<p>物評報告</p>
<p>物價評議會徐主任委員代表陳秘書報告最近抑平物價情形，就中央社提出之二問題，答覆如次：</p>
<p>（一）最近抑平物價工作之收效情形如何？</p>
<p>（答）此次抑平物價大檢查開始以來，本市一般物價指數，大都已止漲回跌，其中以紙類西藥化學工業原料等跌勢最爲顯著。據一般觀測，按照最近物價趨勢，茍不發動抑平，則本週物價將繼續上漲百分之二十，出入之間，不啻相差至百分之四十以上矣。惟與人民生活最有直接關係之米糧油煤肉類蔬菜地貨等類，以管轄未能統一，反多上漲，殊值注意。現關於米煤二項，已向中央建議根本辦法，其餘蔬菜肉類地貨等，亦與有關機關商洽統一評價，不久當有合理辦法。</p>
<p>(二)物價評議委員會公佈價格後，中央市場方面又另有價格發表，未悉物評會對此　，如何處置？</p>
<p>（答）本市公定價格發表後，中央市場又於報紙發表不同之價格一事，經物價評議委員會於本月四日召開特別會議，幷請中央市場派員列席說明理由，經該市場代表當場聲明，自行撤銷其所定價格，幷經議決嗣後關於該市場之蔬菜地貨南北貨樹柴等價格，非經物評會評定，或主任委員核定，不得公布。</p>

<h3>田賦實物徵收　對棉田之影響</h3>
<p>— 葉景華</p>
<p>今秋江蘇省田賦改以實物徵收，每畝賦類，爲白米一斗此爲當局之政令，爲人民者自當服從也。惟其影響於棉田者，非在乎徵收實物，而在乎徵收之實物不爲棉田所產之棉花，而爲一粒不產之白米也。益以賦類不分輕重，棉田米田，視爲一律，致使產棉區人士負担加增。茲分兩點伸連之；</p>
<p>（一）米田棉田賦額一律之影響　以往田賦賦額米田棉田截然不同，大致米田賦額大於棉田倍半，此爲根據收益率而定，亦爲歷年來當局所規定，迄今已遞沿而成習慣矣。而今歲忽突然更易爲一律徵收同額，不分彼此，實令人不解也。因目下棉田業主收到之租金每畝爲一千四百四十元，而繳納田賦須百米一斗（現價爲一千一百元，將來尚不可知），則如能十足收到，尚堪應付（然從未十足收到過），不幸今年棉花年成祇有五成多（本鄉常熟一角如此），故租金亦勢必打五六折，如此業主僅收到八九百元一畝，即全部以之繳納田賦，亦不足够，更有其他如他收人帳房及地方捐款等等雜費，缺一不可，故今歲棉田業主之前途，誠不堪設想，此諒非當局意料所及也。</p>
<p>（二）棉田田賦以白米繳納之影響棉田祗產棉花，不產白米。產棉區平日之米糧，胥賴產米區運來，如遇統制及運輸的意外事項發生，即能障時引起　食恐慌。即如現在新米登場之時，米價每石亦須一萬一千元之巨·故若使素來食糧不足的產棉區，徵出頗白米，充作田賦，實不可能。因棉地粒米不產，故農民工向業主選租，數十年來，例照習慣以國幣計算，更以年成好壞來決定。如要求農民工繳納白米，事實上絕對不可能。即官應直接向其徵收，亦屬徒勢，因問題在於根本無白米也。如此業主所收者爲國幣，而田賦須白米，則勢必羣起湧至產米，區大量競購米糧，愈買價愈高，除直接刺激產地米價值綫上升外，更影響產棉區米價之狂跳，且業主以有限之八九百元一畝之租金，採購日漲夜大之米價，如何能成？且更受不良米商在中間中飽，以及運輸困難沿途勒索等種種麻煩，不勝枚舉，且更興內地米統會之法令抵觸。業主之焦頭爛額，恐亦非當局始料所及也。</p>
<p>以上兩點，爲出賦徵收白米對棉田之影響。爲收白米對棉田之影響。爲今之計，管見以爲當局旣徵收「實物」，則何不對產棉區徵收棉花以代白米，此其一。米田棉田賦額，旣歷來不同收益不同，則何不分等徵收，此其二。</p>

<h3>Fierce Bombing of Various Islands by Japanese Air Force Heavily Damages Enemy Strategic Bases, General Headquarters Announces Aerial Combat Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 10th: (1) On the 8th, before dawn, Japanese air forces attacked enemy bases on Morotai Island, destroying four runways and ground facilities, causing fires. (2) On the 9th, in the afternoon, Japanese air forces attacked Los Negros Island, Admiralty Islands, destroying eight enemy aircraft, causing fires. Approximately fifty enemy large and medium-sized aircraft on the ground were destroyed, thirty of which exploded. (3) On the 9th, Japanese air forces also attacked the enemy airfield in Maffin, New Guinea, destroying several locations and causing fires.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) On the 9th, Japanese air forces bombed enemy operational bases in the Philippines for the first time, and fiercely bombarded Morotai Island, a large enemy equipment assembly area supporting operations in the Philippines. Simultaneously, they conducted a surprise attack on the enemy's large land-based aircraft and the enemy strategic base at Maffin Airfield, New Guinea Island, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy in each operation. (1) On the 8th, around 4:00 AM, Japanese air forces braved extremely bad weather to launch a strong attack on the enemy airfield on Morotai Island. Braving intense defensive fire, they dropped large bombs on the runway and ground facilities, destroying four of their facilities before safely returning to base. (2) On the 9th, around 3:00 PM, Japanese air forces launched a sudden attack on Haan Airfield on Los Negros Island, severely bombing more than fifty enemy large and medium-sized aircraft parked on the airfield. In addition to destroying more than thirty of them, they also caused eight of its facilities to catch fire. Although enemy anti-aircraft fire was extremely intense at the time, the Japanese forces were able to safely fly back after confirming the aforementioned combat results. (3) On the 9th, around 3:30 AM, Japanese air forces launched a sudden attack on Maffin Airfield on New Guinea Island, braving intense enemy anti-aircraft fire and conducting intense bombing, causing several of its facilities to catch fire.</p>
<h3>Typhoon Hits Leyte, No Change in Ground Warfare, U.S. Forces in Carigara Isolated</h3>
<p>Manila, 10th (Central News Agency) The decisive land battle between Japanese and American forces on Leyte Island has seen no significant changes, with only fierce local battles occurring. The Japanese forces are seizing opportunities to cause the enemy to retreat, and the enemy has also acknowledged the above facts. The gist of their broadcast is as follows: The fighting in the Carigara area is extremely fierce. On the 5th, a portion of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division was surrounded by Japanese forces carrying tanks and vehicles, suffering a fierce attack. As a result, the U.S. forces were isolated. The U.S. forces fought to the last, with only five men escaping.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from New York, an American war correspondent reported the situation on Leyte on the 9th as follows: Along the Ormoc Highway, a typhoon with winds of 100 miles per hour struck the battlefield today. U.S. military operations and resupply have been affected. Moreover, due to a fierce Japanese offensive, a state of intense combat has developed. Near Pinamopoan, the best front-line units of the Japanese army are attacking U.S. forces, causing significant damage to the U.S. army. Due to the typhoon, the forwardmost U.S. forces are almost cut off from resupply, and they have had to conserve ammunition, with some units reportedly lacking food. The battle situation bulletin of General MacArthur's headquarters on the 9th also stated that although there was a typhoon in that area, the fighting was still extremely fierce, and the Japanese artillery fire was very accurate.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 10th (Central News Agency) On Peleliu Island, enemy forces are gradually reinforcing sandbag positions and advancing towards the Japanese army's positions in the central highlands. The advance is extremely slow, and morale is low. The situation on the island is stagnant, with no changes of any kind.</p>
<h3>Strict Punishment for Malcontents in the Philippines Ordered</h3>
<p>Manila, 10th (Central News Agency) Philippine Interior Minister Sison, in his capacity as Acting Commander under the Laurel Martial Law Order, telegraphed martial law commanders in various martial law districts, ordering strict punishment under the martial law order for malcontents who attempt to disrupt, rebel, or engage in actions beneficial to the enemy.</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Praises General Yamashita</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) Following the Japanese Army Ministry's announcement of the appointment of General Tomoyuki Yamashita as the supreme commander of ground forces in the Philippines, the general, renowned for his lightning war on the Malay Peninsula, is deeply admired by the German populace. As a result, the German government and public have high expectations for the general. Various newspapers have carried prominent coverage, especially the "Deutsches Nachrichtenblatt," which published a glowing eulogy on the 9th: "The appointment of General Tomoyuki Yamashita as the supreme commander of the army in the Philippines shows the importance the Japanese high command places on the battle in the Philippines. General Yamashita, the victor in the Malayan campaign and the conqueror of Singapore, is undoubtedly Japan's leading military figure today. The general possesses exceptional leadership and organizational skills, as well as extensive military knowledge and unparalleled foresight. He will surely command decisively and inflict great damage on the enemy."</p>
<h3>Important Speech by Japanese Minister Iguchi "Who is the Aggressor?"</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) Iguchi, the Third Minister of the Japanese Government Information Bureau, stated the following when he met with a group of foreign reporters on the 10th regarding Chairman Stalin's statement during his speech commemorating the 27th anniversary of the revolution, calling Japan an "aggressor nation": "Chairman Stalin called Japan an aggressor nation in his speech commemorating the anniversary of the revolution, but there is nothing in this speech to suggest any change in the Soviet Union's policy towards Japan. Anyone who understands the course of Japanese-American negotiations before the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States will probably not consider Japan an aggressor. The Japanese government has clarified this fact to the Chinese and foreign public through repeated statements and declarations. Japan was compelled to resort to arms under the strong pressure of Britain and the United States. Granting independence to Burma and the Philippines is proof of Japan's liberation of East Asia. The fact that Japan is not an aggressor is even being acknowledged by the enemy countries. For example, British Production Minister Lyttelton stated in his speech on June 20 that it was quite strange how the United States was drawn into the war, saying that the United States provoked Japan, and as a result, Japan had no choice but to attack the United States. Today, the countries and nations of East Asia that have been liberated are gradually gaining their independence and sovereignty, working together for mutual welfare, while Britain and the United States want to re-enslave Burma and the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Eyewitness Account by Air Force Personnel of the Attack on Pearl Harbor</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Military Ministry announced to the entire army yesterday that five brave warriors, including Petty Officer First Class Nishi-kawa, who were posthumously promoted by two ranks, have been constantly engaged in reconnaissance activities throughout the Pacific since the second surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on March 4 of the previous year, making great contributions to the overall war effort. In late August of that year, during the Second Battle of the Solomon Islands, the five warriors were tasked with searching for the enemy and encountered a group of enemy fighters, dying bravely in battle. According to a crew member who personally participated in the Second Surprise Attack on Pearl Harbor, the situation of the operation on that day was as follows: "On that day, all of our preparations were complete. The heavy flying boat floated safely on the waves of the Pacific Ocean, then took off from the water and flew for several hours. As night deepened, it was approaching the fourth of the month, and we were about to approach French Frigate Shoals. At this point, it was difficult to predict when and where the enemy would rise up to meet us, so our tension reached its peak. Soon, French Frigate Shoals appeared before our eyes. Heaven blessed French Frigate Shoals with clear weather as usual, not a cloud in the sky, and a bright moon. When we flew over French Frigate Shoals, we prayed to each other under the moonlight: 'This surprise attack will surely succeed.' When we were about to fly into the airspace over Pearl Harbor, the beams of enemy searchlights slanted and shone upwards, and the number of lights in the sky visibly increased. Countless lights also shone from the surface of the sea in Pearl Harbor Naval Base. The lead flying boat slowly reached the airspace over Pearl Harbor Naval Base and saw the silhouettes of ships accommodated in the East Sea Naval Factory. They immediately dropped huge bombs on them, and intense flames of explosions erupted on the ground. At this time, enemy anti-aircraft guns also successively fired into the sky. When other flying boat units rushed into Pearl Harbor Naval Base, most of the sky was covered by dark clouds. The flying boat units calmly circled once before dropping bombs on the naval factory, making sure they hit their targets. They then flew back slowly. During the three attacks, although the enemy's counterattack was fierce, a gap suddenly opened in the thick clouds in a corner of the sky above the naval base during the third attack. We flew in and dropped bombs as desired, completing our mission and returning slowly. During this operation, the Japanese flying boats suffered no losses, and there was no enemy aircraft counterattack. Our air raid was even more perfect."</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Attending the Ninth Advisory Meeting</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>The Municipal Advisory Committee of this city held its ninth plenary meeting yesterday. Brief news has already been disclosed in various newspapers. I believe it is necessary to provide a more detailed explanation to the citizens. Therefore, based on what I know, I will express my thoughts as follows:</p>
<p>In this meeting, there were two relatively important reports from the municipal government:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the price of household rice, it has recently been increased from 350 yuan to 500 yuan per dou (unit of dry measure), which is truly a last resort. If calculated according to the purchase cost, it exceeds 500 yuan by a considerable amount. Therefore, the monthly deficit of the municipal government's household rice is quite large. Now, through the efforts of the municipal government and the assistance of the Central Reserve Bank, a solution has been found to make up for the deficit, and there will be no further price increases. At the same time, it is gratifying that the allocation of household rice has been secured for the future, and there will be no further delays. Therefore, the members of the advisory committee and the municipal government at this meeting hope that there will be no price increases during the upcoming National Day and Lunar New Year. The rumors circulating outside about delayed allocations of household rice are all rumors. It is hoped that the citizens understand this and do not panic, lest they be exploited by rice profiteers.</p>
<p>(2) The Municipal Tax Consolidation Committee has achieved some initial results after more than a month of efforts. For example, the recent increase in military and police expenses, although not entirely satisfactory, proves that if consolidation is carried out properly, the results will be considerable, and the municipal finances will gradually become sufficient. However, the citizens must also assist, for example, by not evading tax obligations and reporting tax officials who commit fraud at any time, in order to achieve better results. I think the citizens already realize that if the municipal finances are sufficient, the funding for public security can be increased, and public security will be established accordingly. Then, by fulfilling their tax obligations today, they can ensure local security tomorrow, which is also ensuring their own lives and property.</p>
<p>In addition, the three most important points of discussion were:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the recovery of the Central Market, Livestock Market, Fish Market, etc., the current business scope of the Central Market is gradually exceeding its boundaries, resulting in numerous malpractices. For example, Chinese medicines and tin foil are also distributed through the Central Market. Secondly, from the perspective of the citizens, the market price of vegetables is gradually increasing artificially, causing suffering to the people. In fact, vegetables are neither within the scope of control nor military supplies, and the management methods should have been changed long ago to adapt to the welfare of the people. Even if a portion is supplied to the military, it will not be hindered after the management methods are changed. It is said that the Allied authorities have repeatedly expressed their intention to return the management, which is certainly a wise move by the Allies. It is hoped that it will be realized as soon as possible. To give an example, there should be a unified method for price management, but in the past, the prices of the Central Market were often handled separately, causing the people a lot of unnecessary suffering. Therefore, we advocate that businesses that can be run independently by the Chinese should be allowed to be run by the Chinese themselves. It is hoped that the municipal government will negotiate for the recovery as soon as possible based on requests from all parties.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the issue of raising the salaries of public, police, and teaching staff in this city, the advisory committee has repeatedly suggested that the salaries of municipal government employees are too far from the standard of living needs. We know that the municipal government is also very concerned about and attaches great importance to the issue of raising the salaries of its employees, no less than the members of the advisory committee. However, limited by the municipal finances, it can only be adjusted gradually. This time, the advisory committee suggested setting up a "Municipal Government Employee Cost of Living Allowance Adjustment Committee" as soon as possible, which would work with the Municipal Tax Consolidation Committee to reasonably stipulate the amount of the allowance based on the price index of daily necessities, so as to gradually achieve a level where the cost of living allowance is consistent with the cost of living. From the standpoint of the citizens, the municipal government employees are serving the local community, and they should fully bear their living expenses. Even if there is still a shortfall after consolidating taxes, they would be very willing to increase taxes. Therefore, it is hoped that the municipal government will, on the one hand, encourage public servants to serve the local community wholeheartedly and, on the other hand, eliminate redundant personnel as much as possible.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the issue of increasing the entertainment tax, the short commentary in this newspaper on the 7th advocated increasing the ticket prices for dog racing and jai alai venues, and using all the proceeds for municipal government taxes. The French dog racing venue has even adopted an opposing attitude, which is an extremely unwise move by the French businessmen. We believe that dog racing is unnecessary in the first place. If dog racing must be held, then the entertainment tax must be collected. It is hoped that the municipal government will not hesitate and decisively dispose of the matter to achieve the purpose of collecting taxes.</p>
<h3>Rear Admiral Minato Appointed Japanese Naval Attaché; Lieutenant General Kondo Transferred to Naval General Staff</h3>
<p>Lieutenant General Kondo, the current Japanese Naval Attaché in Shanghai, has been transferred to the Naval General Staff on the 7th of this month, and will soon leave Shanghai. Lieutenant General Kondo has served as the Japanese Naval Attaché in Shanghai for one year and two months. He has many close friends among the Chinese people, and is known for his gentle disposition and deep understanding of and sympathy for China. His departure from Shanghai is regretted by all parties.</p>
<p>His successor, Rear Admiral Keijo Minato, assumed office at the Naval Attaché's Office yesterday (the 10th).</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Keijo Minato</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Keijo Minato is 49 years old. He graduated from the Naval Academy in the fifth year of the Taisho era (1916). He has served in China on numerous occasions. From 1932 onwards, he served as a staff officer in the China Fleet. After that, he served as a naval attaché in Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, he served as the captain of an aircraft carrier, actively participating in the southern front. He then served as the Chief of the Second Section of the Naval Armaments Bureau and as an instructor at the Naval Academy before assuming his current position.</p>
<p>Inaugural Speech</p>
<p>After assuming office, Rear Admiral Keijo Minato delivered a speech to the Japanese residents, saying: "I am pleased to have been transferred to China to serve in this new role during this decisive stage. I have close relations with the fellow residents in various aspects, and I hope for your guidance and assistance in the performance of my duties.</p>
<p>As for the mindset we should have in this decisive situation, it is to strive to overcome any difficulties in order to complete the great task of defeating Britain and the United States. At this critical time, what is especially desired is to be sincere in one's responsibilities and towards others, and to always be calm and unhurried. After the great defeat at Dunkirk, Britain was in a major crisis. At that time, British Home Secretary Morrison told his people: 'Those with courage and enthusiasm will never be defeated.' Although this statement came from the enemy, it should also be remembered by us. To defeat such an enemy, it is necessary to be even more calm and unhurried than them. I hope that everyone can maintain this mindset from beginning to end."</p>

<h3>Three Focus Points on the Western Front: Major Battles Underway, U.S. Troops Crossing the Moselle River Annihilated</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) The situation on the Western Front has become tense again. It is reported that fierce battles are currently unfolding in three war zones: the Western Front, eastern France near the southern wing, the vicinity of Aachen, and the Netherlands at the northernmost wing. Patton's U.S. Third Army has launched a major offensive aimed at the Saar Basin since the morning of the 8th, and has further reinforced three divisions to attack the French border regions of Lorraine and Metz. At the same time, the German resistance is also extremely fierce, thwarting the enemy's operational intentions everywhere, especially in the area northeast of Gottmadingen and west of Chateau-Salins, inflicting heavy losses on the U.S. military. The German counteroffensive in the Aachen area has made the fighting even more intense.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) Overseas Chinese News Agency: The U.S. military in the southern part of the Western Front has launched a large-scale offensive between the Moselle and Rhine-Marne Canal. Several U.S. divisions in this area have the assistance of air power and artillery, as well as all technical advantages, making the offensive quite strong. The German side had long detected the concentration of elite U.S. troops and was waiting for an opportunity to act. German commanders have already made the necessary preparations, so the resistance is very strong. There have also been troop and ordnance concentrations around Aachen, and a major battle is likely to occur soon. The U.S. military has begun to deploy smoke screens.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) German News Agency: On Wednesday evening, after a short period of preparatory artillery fire, the U.S. military crossed the Moselle River at three locations in the southern Luxembourg area. At that time, the German army immediately launched a counteroffensive and annihilated the U.S. troops who had crossed the river, with only a small remnant of the enemy fleeing back to the other side of the river.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Forces in Italy Launch Offensive</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) The Italian front has recently broken out of its stalemate. The British Eighth Army has launched a large-scale offensive in the eastern Apennine Mountains and the Adriatic Sea, while the U.S. Fifth Army is also preparing for battle.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) Overseas Chinese News Agency: The British Eighth Army began an offensive in the Adriatic coastal area several days ago in the area north of Cassiano, which is still in full swing, with the Sassena-Forli highway as the focus of contention. The British army has concentrated a large number of troops in the bridgehead west of the Ronco River in that area. The British army first bombarded the area with heavy artillery for a long time before advancing towards Forli. Later, it encountered a strong German counteroffensive and retreated to the Ronco River. The left wing of the British Eighth Army then attempted to break into the plain between Forli and Faenza, but was also thwarted by strong German resistance. It remains to be seen whether the current offensive by the British Eighth Army along the Apennines towards the northwest is intended to cut off the German forces in the Faenza-Bologna line, or is merely to contain the German forces in the eastern corner of the Po Plain.</p>
<h3>Performance of the British New Weapon V-2</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German Head of State's headquarters announced at noon on the 9th: The V-2 has continued to bombard London since the 8th.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the power of the V-2, the German military authorities announced the following on the 9th: (1) It has a greater explosive force than the V-1 and its destructive power is also extremely large. (2) It has a longer flight range than the V-1. (3) The launch site is built extremely cleverly and will never be discovered. (4) It is more accurate than the V-1. The occurrence of the most recent bombing event can prove the accuracy of the V-2 attack. According to British intelligence, the explosions occurring behind the Western Front have caused agitation within the anti-Axis camp, which is also a testament to the power of the V-2. (5) It is still difficult to predict what impact this new weapon will have on the war situation, but the German army will continue to use the new weapon.</p>
<h3>German People Show Perseverance, Will Surely Be Able to Cope with Difficulties - Goebbels Publishes Article</h3>

<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: If the Soviet army on the Eastern Front intends to attack the Königsberg area of East Prussia, the German army under General Riebau will threaten them. Therefore, it is possible that the Soviet army will attack Liepāja. The Soviet army has concentrated a large force in the Lithuanian area, and the German army is also on high alert. The winter offensive will be launched on the entire line from Memel to the Carpathian Mountains. While the Soviet army attacks East Prussia, it will simultaneously attack Poland. The Soviet Union clearly wants to achieve victory before the arrival of severe winter. The fighting in the central section of the Tisza River is intensifying. Soviet troops are attempting to outflank the German positions southeast of Hongjing, but have been repelled.</p>
<p>Hongjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: After the authorities urged men in the Pest district to voluntarily evacuate, the situation in Hongjing remains very calm.</p>

<h3>Fierce Street Fighting in Guilin City - Japanese Army Occupies Liuzhou - Continuing to Reinforce Troops,展开 Intense Battle</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese army base on the Guilin front, the Japanese army's general offensive on Guilin city has become even more desperate.

Fierce fighting is currently underway. After the Japanese vanguard entered the city, they immediately seized the Provincial Government Library and the stadium. On the morning of the 10th, they fiercely attacked the stubbornly resisting Chongqing army. On the morning of the 9th, the Japanese army, after crossing the Guijiang River, gradually established bridgehead fortresses on the east side of Guilin city and expanded their battle results. From the afternoon of that day to the morning of the 10th, the elite Japanese troops, with the close cooperation of the air force and tank units, fought as one, rushing into Guilin city and launching fierce street fighting. The complete fall of Guilin city is imminent.</p>
<p>Guangxi Front, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese South China Army rapid unit, after launching a fierce attack on Liuzhou city on the morning of the 9th, broke through the north gate at 8:40 a.m. on the morning of the 10th, rushed into the city streets, and launched a heroic melee with the Chongqing army in various parts of the city.

<p>Advising the Chongqing Military and Civilians to Cease Fire</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese army base on the Guangxi front, the Japanese army unit attacking Guilin distributed leaflets to the Chongqing army on the evening of the 8th, explaining the true meaning of this operation and advising them to stop fighting. The general idea was that the purpose of this operation was entirely to destroy the hegemonic attempts of Britain and the United States. Anyone who can exclude cooperation with Britain and the United States, whether Chinese soldiers or civilians, is not our enemy. Therefore, we hope that you will quickly and completely cease fire, and then closely cooperate with Japan to destroy the common enemies, Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese army base outside Guilin city, the Japanese army unit attacking Guilin crossed the Guijiang River on the morning of the 9th, rushed into the streets of Guilin city, and continued to reinforce its troops. On the morning of the 10th, they occupied the Guangxi Provincial Government in the city. Other Japanese army units are also compressing the encirclement line. The Chongqing 31st Army and the 131st Division fled southwest from the south side of Kaojun Road southwest of Guilin and are now surrounded by the Japanese army, engaging in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese army base outside Guilin city, the Japanese army advancing from the north of Guilin broke into the city through the north gate of Guilin at 11:20 a.m. on the 10th and is currently launching a mopping-up operation.</p>
<p>Guilin Surrounded by Three Sides</p>
<p>Guangxi Front, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army in the middle of the Yujiang and Liujiang Rivers, which was attacked from both sides, has been heavily besieged due to the skillful operations of the Japanese army's southern outflanking unit. Furthermore, due to the compression attack of the Japanese army's follow-up units, it is showing signs of collapse. The vanguard unit of the Japanese army from the Longshanxu area began to advance towards Zhangmuxu (4 kilometers from Longshanxu and Xishuizhou) on the night of the 25th. At dusk on the 6th, they broke into Huangling, the Chongqing army stronghold in front of the area, and also occupied the Chongqing army strongholds such as Pankou (east of Ping'an, about 25 kilometers northwest of Shishixu). At the same time, the Japanese army in the Zhonglixu area captured Shimo (30 kilometers southwest of Laibin) on that day, and began attacking from three sides at dawn on the 7th.</p>
<p>Completing the Encircling Posture of Liuzhou</p>
<p>Guangri Central News Agency reports from a Japanese army front base in Guangxi that after the Japanese army began a general offensive against Guilin city, it launched a fierce battle with the Chongqing 31st Army. At the same time, the Japanese army's fierce attack on Liuzhou became even more intense from the 8th onwards, even more so than the Battle of Hengyang. On the morning of the 8th, the Japanese army occupied Luorong, 25 kilometers northeast of Liuzhou, and launched a fierce attack with another Japanese army unit on the outer defense line of the Chongqing army near Liuzhou, launching a melee. Furthermore, the Japanese army advancing north from South China occupied Xiang County on the 6th and launched a fierce attack on Liuzhou, establishing a posture of attacking from the north and south. The main force of the Chongqing army defending Liuzhou was the 62nd Army and the Independent Tank Regiment, and artillery units were transferred from Nanning to attempt a general counter-offensive. Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi and Fourth War Zone Commander Zhang Fakui personally supervised the battle. Since Guilin and Liuzhou are both bases for the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, it is natural for US aircraft to come to aid in order to continue maintaining the war of resistance. Therefore, the Battle of Liuzhou can be said to be the largest and most intense battle on the mainland this time, and the Japanese army is giving it a heavy blow by fully exerting its strength.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the Liuzhou front, the Japanese army, after crossing the Liujiang River near Xiang County, rushed towards Liuzhou all the way, eliminating the stubborn resistance of the Chongqing army. At 4:20 p.m. on the 9th, they broke into the eastern end of the Liuzhou Airport. Then, at 5:00 p.m., they completely occupied it. The Japanese army is currently launching a fierce attack on the troops in the center of the city.</p>
<p>Guangxi Front, 10th (Central News Agency) - On the morning of the 8th, after a certain unit of the Japanese army occupied 雊rong, it further eliminated the resistance of the Chongqing 62nd Army and field artillery units defending Liuzhou near Gaolingtang (8 kilometers northeast of Liuzhou) and Sanbijiang (10 kilometers northeast of Liuzhou) on the morning of the 9th. Fierce battles are underway in the outer defense line of the Chongqing army in the northeastern area of Liuzhou. Another Japanese army unit is approaching Changtangxu (15 kilometers north of Liuzhou) and is currently shrinking the encirclement of Liuzhou.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Army Base on the South China Front, 10th (Central News Agency) - After occupying Xiang County on the 6th, the Japanese army's vanguard unit forcibly crossed the Liujiang River and continued to advance to the northwest, and has now reached an area several kilometers away from the river crossing point. Furthermore, the Japanese army units that captured Wuyi broke into Laibin, about 70 kilometers southwest of Liuzhou, at 10:30 a.m. on the 9th, and continued to cross the Wujiang River, securing the highlands and controlling the Chongqing army's retreat route. According to reports, Laibin is the last stronghold of Liuzhou, directly reaching Liuzhou. The Japanese army's northward unit arrived at a certain place at noon on the 9th, crossed the river, and looked back at Liuzhou, advancing fiercely.</p>
<p>Foreign News Reports on the Situation in Guangxi Province</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - Reuters' correspondent in Chongqing reported on the 9th on the situation in Guangxi Province as follows: "Under the cover of its army, the Japanese army is fiercely attacking the Chongqing army's defense line outside Guilin, and is adopting an encirclement posture in Liuzhou. The attacking Japanese army is currently advancing from the north, east, and south. The northern unit is currently advancing directly towards the city from the 27-kilometer highway north of Liuzhou. The eastern unit is currently pressing towards Luorong, about 27 kilometers northeast of Liuzhou on the Xiang-Gui Railway. The southern unit is currently crossing the Liujiang River and attacking various places south of Liuzhou."

Here, it is divided into two teams, one team attacking 24 kilometers north of Liuzhou, and the other team killing to 19 kilometers north of Liucheng (17.5 kilometers northwest of Liuzhou). According to the Chongqing military authorities, the Chongqing army has stopped the Japanese army's advance. On the other hand, the Japanese army traveling south along the Xiang-Gui Railway and heading straight for Liuzhou has advanced to the outer defense line of Luorong. The Chongqing military authorities also admitted that the Japanese army is further intensifying pressure from 75 kilometers east of Liuzhou. The Japanese army's westward advance from Wuxuan has also seen progress. This move is clearly the Japanese army's action to prevent the Chongqing army from moving south along the street south of Liuzhou. This unit advanced 24 kilometers and has now reached 19.5 kilometers southwest of Liuzhou."</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Fuzhou Expands Occupied Area</h3>

<h3>Interests Away From Home</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>Reporters living in the city are indeed somewhat spoiled and pampered. In addition, having studied abroad for many years in the past, they have inevitably picked up a trace of Europeanization and become believers in material civilization. Although I am confident that I am definitely not one of those who think "the moon is better abroad," as the saying goes, "habit becomes nature," and "a deep-rooted habit is hard to change." There is indeed some small truth in this.</p>
<p>This time, I, as a reporter, was assigned to Nanhui to investigate the rural economy and social situation, so I had the opportunity to linger in the countryside and interact with the villagers every day. This has led to a change in my mechanical lifestyle of many years. At first, I was very unaccustomed to it, but gradually I became calm and composed. This proves that humans are animals capable of adapting to the environment. I will not count the trivial details, but will provide a few interesting things that have happened during my time away from home to the readers of this newspaper, just to elicit a smile.</p>
<p>Villagers Don't Recognize City Things</p>
<p>Before I left, my friend Xia Jun (who has a badge shop in Taishan Road) gave me a horseshoe-shaped golden pin to wish me success in my work on this trip. In order not to disappoint my dear friend's good intentions and to fulfill my own mission, I inserted it in my lapel to encourage myself. Because the style was exquisite and quite novel, after arriving here, I went to the countryside to talk with farmers about everything for days in order to understand the people's feelings and hidden pain. During each conversation, the villagers paid attention to this little thing, and although I felt very puzzled at the time, I couldn't figure out why, and just thought they were making a fuss over something they rarely saw. Until a few days ago, when I talked about planning to go to several more distant coastal areas for inspection in the near future, a farmer solemnly offered me advice, saying that the治安 was not good in that area, and that I should remove this badge to avoid complications. Only then did I suddenly realize and couldn't help but laugh silently. They had mistaken this for a certificate, which was almost comical, but at the time, their earnest concern was evident in their words, which was touching.</p>
<p>Eggs, Beans, and Mutton, Three Nutrients in One</p>
<p>It's the height of autumn, and people in the city, especially the nouveau riche, are busy planning for the winter tonic that will arrive in a flash, while those who live on salaries are probably unable to keep up with three meals a day, let alone nourishing themselves. Even basic nutrition is out of the question! I am not flaunting the wealth of the rich. To be honest, I am also a member of the latter camp, but because I have always believed in "health is capital" and in the old saying of our Eastern quintessence, "where there's life, there's hope," I always pay attention to my own nutrition within my means. This time when I came to the countryside, due to time and environmental constraints, and because there were no restaurants in the villages, I had to use local materials and ask the temporary host to buy local specialty eggs, soybean milk, and cooked mutton, and cook them together. It can be eaten in an instant, and its taste is truly endless. As for nutrition, I am afraid it is ten times better than any tonics or supplements, but the price is only one-tenth of that of tonics or supplements. This is also an invention and harvest during the trip.</p>
<p>Hard to Find a Free Day in the Midst of Busyness</p>
<p>I have been in Nanhui for a week, visiting farmhouses in the suburbs for days, searching for information, running around all day long. Although it is not without hardship, when I receive the warm and sincere hospitality of the farmers, and when I think of the responsibility of a journalist, I receive a lot of comfort in my spirit, and I have already driven the physical pain out of the clouds without shape. Now that the work in the urban area has come to an end for the time being, I will start a long journey to other places in the near future. For the sake of waiting for my companions, I have a free day to take the opportunity to visit the famous attractions of Nanhui, which is especially gratifying.</p>
<p>Four Dynasties Ginkgo Suffers a Great Calamity</p>
<p>Next to Fuquan Temple in Nanhui City, there is an ancient ginkgo tree from the Song Dynasty. It is more than a dozen 合 tall and more than ten feet long, and the trunk is empty. According to the villagers, when there is thunder and rain, flames sometimes erupt from the gaps, and huge snakes appear. A duel between dragons and tigers once took place. According to what I saw, there are still cat remains stored on the branches. The tree stands proudly, with an extraordinary spirit. According to the giant trees I have seen in the past, apart from the large tree in Robinson Village near Paris (this tree is huge and beautiful, with green leaves providing shade. Small pavilions are built between the branches, with coffee seats for tourists to rest and chat intimately.), this is the second tree. Unfortunately, this tree, which originally soared into the clouds, was easily mistaken as a target by the guerrillas outside the city, so the top branches were all sawn off, and now it has become nothing less than a bald giant. If the big tree knew, it would cry out in protest endlessly. In addition to regretting for the tree, I also feel that "a tree can live for a thousand years, but a person is only dew on the grass," so it is appropriate to strive immediately, so as not to fail this short life.</p>
<p>Two Generations of Grand Bells Sound No More</p>
<p>Just a stone's throw away from the ginkgo tree, there is Fuquan Temple, which is a nunnery. The temple is small but very clean. The courtyard is arranged in an orderly manner, and the Buddha statues are also radiant, and the altar and shrine covers are also spotless. It can be called a pure land of Buddhism, which is not comparable to the broken walls and rubble of the Chenghuang Temple in Shanghai, which is full of desolation. During the visit, all the nuns were working in the farmland in front of the temple, leaving only a young nun with her hair still growing to guard the temple. (According to the customs here, young girls come to the temple to rely on the Buddha, fearing that their six senses have not been purified and will regret it in the future, so they are temporarily allowed to live in the temple with their hair still growing, and they still have the opportunity to return to secular life at any time.) There is a bell in the temple that is as tall as it is big. It is a relic of the Ming Dynasty. I raised a wooden mallet and planned to strike it to test the sound of the bell, but the young nun stopped me, saying that its sound was very loud and could reach tens of miles away. In this time of social unrest and frequent incidents, it is easy to be misunderstood as a beacon fire, so this huge object, which is originally a grand chime, has been silenced by Jin Ren's three restraints, and has been silent for many days. Hearing this, I couldn't help but feel wronged for the grand bell, lamenting that it had suffered the same fate as the ginkgo tree.</p>

<h3>Advisory Committee Suggests Taking Back the Central Market, Changing it to a City-Run Business, and Increasing Entertainment Tax</h3>
<p>The Municipal Advisory Committee held its ninth plenary meeting at the City Hall at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. The members present were: Wen, Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, Chen Bin, Yao Qing San, Chen Ri Ping, Xiang Kangyuan, Dai, Shen Si Liang, Pei Yun, Wu, Zhu Bo Zhong, Guo Shun, Ren, and more than twenty others. Secretary-General Wu of the City Government and the directors of various bureaus and departments also participated, and Mayor Chen also attended in person. Standing Committee Chairman Li Sihao was absent due to illness and was replaced by Lin Kanghou as acting chairman. First, Secretary-General Wu reported on the household rice ration price issue and the preliminary collection of the Municipal Tax Consolidation Committee. (1) Regarding the household rice ration price issue, it should originally be based on the purchase cost price. In order to reduce the burden on the citizens, the city government has found a concrete solution for the difference, so the current period will still be rationed at the original price. (2) The Municipal Tax Consolidation Committee has initially consolidated tax collection and has achieved appropriate results. The city government has allocated the increased revenue for the increased salaries and allowances of the police bureau staff and security team soldiers in October. Next, all the members discussed: (1) Please The city government should take back the central market, livestock market, and fish market as soon as possible and change them to management businesses to seek to suppress the prices of daily necessities for the citizens. The resolution was passed and sent to the two city governments for handling. (2) The resolution was passed to increase the entertainment tax (including dog racing, jai alai, horse racing, etc.) to increase revenue. The suggestion was sent to the city government. The meeting was adjourned at one o'clock.</p>

<h3>Navy Baojia District to Present Aircraft Naming Ceremony Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The establishment of the Baojia in the Shanghai Naval Garrison District is approaching its third year. The Naval Baojia authorities, recognizing that the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive phase, and considering the enthusiastic contributions from the people of the district to aircraft donation campaigns over the years, which have amounted to a total of 12,148,092 yuan, have decided to purchase 22 fighter aircraft and present them to the authorities to assist in the war effort. To encourage people in all areas to demonstrate the same spirit, and to celebrate the third anniversary of the Naval Baojia establishment, a grand "Naval Baojia Three-Year Aircraft Presentation and Naming Ceremony" will be held tomorrow (12th) at 10:00 AM at the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse Plaza. The spirit of the Naval Garrison District in managing the Baojia has always been the best in the city. This great act of donating funds and aircraft is even more watched and praised by the whole country. Its spirit of cooperating in the Greater East Asia War is worthy of emulation by all East Asian peoples, and it is the most meaningful manifestation of the Shanghai citizens since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The grand occasion at the racecourse can be predicted. However, according to reporters, if it rains tomorrow morning, the ceremony will be postponed. All sectors of society can pay attention to Shanghai Radio (frequency 900) for broadcast news at 8:00 AM.</p>

<h3>"Hua Ci (Chinese Porcelain)" to be Published - Edited by Ding Huikang and Printed by This Newspaper</h3>
<p>China has never had a special sales catalog for ancient ceramics, and even fewer detailed records. The China Art Museum and this newspaper, in view of this, have specially invited Mr. Ding Huikang to collect famous porcelain from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties and photograph them into a large volume of ancient porcelain catalogs. The entire book is printed with four-color copperplate and collotype, and the brilliance of the colors and the elegance of the forms are completely true to the original objects. The entire book is printed on heavy-weight charcoal drawing paper, further enhancing its simplicity. Mr. Ye Gongchuo of Panyu wrote in the preface: "The essence of the art of the earth, the originator of the chemical industry of the divine land, has been an example for thousands of years. After many changes, the outflow of important artifacts overseas is countless. The objects preserved in our country are somewhat inferior. To provide materials for artists' research, this is the only way to pass on to future generations." His words can be described as generous. The entire book is now scheduled to be published before the end of this month. Advance orders are only charged 10,000 yuan per copy to cover costs, and with the consent of the editor, half of the proceeds will be donated to the newspaper's student aid fund. This is a unique opportunity to appreciate ancient art and help impoverished students, and it is an indispensable reference classic for researchers and connoisseurs. However, the print run is small, so early reservations are encouraged.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Dachang Stores Fined</h3>
<p>The Economic Security Office recently discovered a large number of food stores that were illegally failing to comply with price limits, attempting to obtain exorbitant profits.

In addition, the office recently received reports and arrested thirteen pork brokers on the 4th of this month on suspicion of manipulating the price of woven bags of pork. These suspects were Wang Caigen, Ding Zhongyan, Nie Zhongyu, Ni Jie, Luo Keming, Zhang Cuyi, Wang Youcheng, Liu Yuyun, Shen Zhaoxi, Ding Keming, Wang Baoqing, Jiang Tinghui, Wang Taisheng, and Xia Zuoyu. Among them, Wang Caigen, Ding Zhongyan, and Nie Zhongyu were deemed to have committed more serious offenses and were only allowed to post bail on the 9th, while the others were allowed to post bail one after another and were subject to call. The case is still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai North and West Housing Registration Urgently Pursued</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Housing Management Committee is conducting housing registration for all existing property owners in Shanghai North and West. All houses in the area, except enemy property, must be registered by the owners in Shanghai within the specified time. The registration period is from September 1st to November 30th of this year. Owners in Shanghai must bring their original property certificates to the Shanghai North Office (27 Fusheng Road, 4th floor of the Japanese Resident Group) to apply for registration. After verification, the Housing Management Committee will issue a housing registration certificate within one week, and the original property certificate will be returned immediately after verification. The housing registration area in the Shanghai North District includes the areas under the jurisdiction of the West Hongkou, Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, Tilanqiao, Yangshupu, Yulin Road, and Zhabei police branch bureaus. The Municipal Government has now ordered the branch bureaus to assist in the investigation of housing, and the branch bureaus will issue housing investigation forms to existing owners in Shanghai. After receiving the investigation form, the owners should fill it out accurately and return it to the police branch bureau, which will then submit it to the Housing Management Committee's district offices for reference during registration. The registration deadline is November 30th of this year, and owners in the area should go to register as soon as possible. Otherwise, the committee will consider the owner to be absent and cancel the registration.</p>

<h3>Chief Guo Discusses Police Supervision - Press Conference Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Office held the 27th press conference at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 10:00 AM yesterday (10th). The director of the Municipal Police Bureau's Supervisory Office, Guo Shaoyi, and the chairman of the Price Review Committee, Xu Tianshen (represented by Secretary Chen Shouyin), attended to report and answer questions from reporters. The report and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Director Guo's Report</p>
<p>Briefly stated: "The internal organization of this office is divided into three sections: administrative, investigation, and inspection. In addition, a reward and punishment supervision office has been set up, dividing the city into seven supervisory districts and supervising the duties of officers and police in 24 branch bureaus and seven suburban branch bureaus. We strive to be strict and swift in handling matters of merit and demerit of officers and police. Those who have been found to have committed misconduct or have failed to fulfill their duties will be punished impartially and in accordance with regulations, without any favoritism. In addition to dispatching inspectors to inspect the duties of officers and police at any time during the day, as winter defense is approaching, we are assigning inspectors to rotate and check nighttime duties to prevent negligence, and to conduct temporary inspections of the internal affairs of each branch bureau, providing detailed instructions on what should be done and what should be reformed to facilitate improvement. Officers and police who retain, extort, or engage in corrupt behavior will be immediately reported by the inspectors, and the bureau will severely punish them after verification. Moreover, we often receive reports from citizens, which are also verified and severely punished. In addition, inspectors of this office must wear uniforms and badges with the words 'Inspector' on them to facilitate identification when inspecting duties in accordance with regulations. However, because the target is too obvious, when police officers are engaged in improper business, they quickly avoid them upon seeing the arrival of inspectors. Therefore, it is extremely rare to find facts of improper conduct by police officers. Therefore, we plan to form a plainclothes inspectorate in the future to conduct close inspections to rectify police discipline. At the same time, we hope that citizens will report to this office with facts when encountering demands from officers and police. We will definitely handle them strictly in accordance with the law and will not favor anyone. We especially hope that citizens will criticize improper demands and eliminate corruption." After the report, reporters immediately raised the following questions:</p>
<p>Hope to Report Police Extortion</p>
<p>(1) Shen Bao asked: Welcoming the city police, every time they perform their official duties, they blatantly extort bribes in broad daylight, which is visible to all and not uncommon. Shanghai is an international city. Now that the concessions have been recovered and the police management is unified and independent. The police, who bear the important responsibility of maintaining law and order, dare to openly accept bribes in full view of the public. Not only do they make a laughingstock of the international community, but they also make the atmosphere of corruption more intense, and the rules of law are vanished. Has your office heard of this, and please tell us about the strategy of supervision and inspection to dispel the concerns of the public.</p>
<p>(2) Zhonghua Daily asked: Recently, police extortion in the streets has become more and more intensified, especially at the Tianhougong Bridge, where there are often as many as 40 or 50 police officers checking pedestrians and openly demanding money when many passengers from the North Station pass by at night. Has the Supervisory Office heard about this phenomenon, and are there any corrective measures?</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) asked: Although the authorities have repeatedly issued orders and strictly prohibited police officers from extorting money along the way, it is still the same. For example, in the most bustling area for citizens to travel, the Bund from Guangdong Road to Nanjing Road, they blatantly demand money in broad daylight, especially when ships arrive late at night. Such behavior by those who defend the people is enough to disturb the people. Do the authorities see this? What are the sanctions?</p>
<p>Because the content of the above three questions is similar, Director Guo gave a comprehensive answer, saying that the Supervisory Office had heard about the open extortion of police officers and had strictly sanctioned it. An average of 50 people are punished for misconduct every day. The branch bureaus have been repeatedly ordered to strictly restrain their subordinate police officers, and the Supervisory Office will also go to each branch bureau to give spiritual talks. In the future, more inspectors will be dispatched to patrol places such as Tianhougong Bridge. We sincerely hope that citizens will describe the facts in detail and provide their real names when reporting. The Supervisory Office will strictly keep secrets and provide the reporter with various conveniences and guarantees.</p>
<p>Material Review Report</p>
<p>Xu, the director of the Price Review Committee, reported on the recent situation of suppressing prices, and answered two questions raised by the Central News Agency as follows:</p>
<p>(1) What is the effect of the recent work to suppress prices?</p>
<p>(Answer) Since the start of this major price suppression inspection, the general price index in this city has generally stopped rising and fallen back, among which the price drop of paper, western medicine, and chemical industrial raw materials is the most significant. According to general observation, according to the recent price trend, if the suppression is not launched, the price this week will continue to rise by 20%. The difference between the two is more than 40%. However, the prices of rice, grain, oil, coal, meat, vegetables, and local goods, which are most directly related to people's lives, have risen due to the failure to unify jurisdiction, which is particularly noteworthy. Currently, we have suggested a fundamental solution to the central government regarding the two items of rice and coal, and we are also discussing with relevant agencies to unify the evaluation of other vegetables, meat, and local goods, which will soon have a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>(2) After the Price Review Committee announced the price, the Central Market also published a price separately. How will the Price Review Committee deal with this?</p>
<p>(Answer) After this city announced the official price, the Central Market published a different price in the newspaper. The Price Review Committee convened a special meeting on the 4th of this month and invited representatives from the Central Market to attend and explain the reason. The representative of the market stated on the spot that it would cancel the price it had set, and it was resolved that the market’s prices for vegetables, local goods, north-south goods, firewood, etc. shall not be published without being evaluated by the Price Review Committee or approved by the Director.</p>

<h3>The Impact of Actual Commodity Tax Collection on Cotton Fields</h3>
<p>— Ye Jinghua</p>
<p>This autumn, Jiangsu Province is changing its land tax collection to actual commodities. Each mu (unit of land area) is taxed at one dou (unit of volume) of white rice. This is the government's decree, and the people should obey it. However, the impact on cotton fields is not in the collection of actual commodities, but in the fact that the actual commodity collected is not cotton, which the cotton fields produce, but white rice, which they do not produce at all. Furthermore, the tax rates do not differentiate between fertile and less fertile land; cotton fields and rice fields are treated the same, which increases the burden on people in cotton-producing areas. I will explain this in two points:</p>
<p>(1) The Impact of Uniform Tax Rates for Rice Fields and Cotton Fields: In the past, land tax rates for rice fields and cotton fields were distinctly different. Generally, the tax rate for rice fields was one and a half times that of cotton fields. This was determined based on the rate of return and was stipulated by the authorities over the years, becoming a tradition to this day. However, this year, it has suddenly and unexpectedly been changed to a uniform tax rate, without distinction, which is truly puzzling. Currently, cotton field owners receive 1,440 yuan in rent per mu, while paying land tax requires one dou of white rice (the current price is 1,100 yuan, and the future is uncertain). If they can collect all the rent, they can barely manage (but it has never been fully collected). Unfortunately, this year's cotton harvest is only a little over 50% (as it is in a corner of Changshu, my hometown), so the rent will inevitably be discounted by 50% or 60%. In this case, the owner will only receive 800 or 900 yuan per mu, which is not enough to pay the land tax even if all of it is used. Moreover, there are other miscellaneous expenses, such as commissions for collectors, accounting fees, and local donations, none of which can be omitted. Therefore, the future of cotton field owners this year is truly unimaginable, which I believe is beyond the authorities' expectations.</p>
<p>(2) The Impact of Paying Land Tax in White Rice for Cotton Fields: Cotton fields only produce cotton, not white rice. The grain for daily consumption in cotton-producing areas relies entirely on transportation from rice-producing areas. If unified control and transportation accidents occur, food shortages can be triggered at any time. Even now, when new rice is on the market, the price is as high as 11,000 yuan per shi (unit of volume). Therefore, it is impossible to collect white rice as land tax from cotton-producing areas, which have always had insufficient grain. Because cotton fields do not produce a single grain of rice, tenant farmers have always rented from landlords for decades, with payments calculated in national currency based on the quality of the harvest. It is absolutely impossible to ask tenant farmers to pay in white rice. Even if the government collects directly from them, it will be futile, because the fundamental problem is that there is no white rice. Thus, the owners collect national currency, but the land tax must be paid in white rice, which will inevitably lead to a mass influx of people to rice-producing areas to compete for rice, driving prices higher. In addition to directly stimulating the rise in rice prices in the producing areas, it will also affect the skyrocketing rice prices in the cotton-producing areas. Moreover, how can owners manage with their limited rent of 800 or 900 yuan per mu to purchase the ever-increasing rice prices? They will also suffer from unscrupulous rice merchants who profit in the middle, as well as various troubles such as transportation difficulties and extortion along the way, which are too numerous to mention, and will also conflict with the laws of the Rice Control Association in the interior. The owners' utter exhaustion may also be beyond the authorities' initial expectations.</p>
<p>The above two points are the impact of collecting white rice as tax on cotton fields. For the current plan, in my humble opinion, since the authorities are collecting "actual commodities," why not collect cotton in cotton-producing areas instead of white rice? This is the first point. Since the tax rates for rice fields and cotton fields have always been different due to different incomes, why not collect taxes at different levels? This is the second point.</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>The Good Virtue Society Pioneers Free Outpatient Treatment and Medication</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Good Virtue Society, located at No. 52, Bin Dai Bridge, Ren Sheng Alley, Xiao Dong Men North, Nanshi, has recently, in addition to its free clinic, expanded its services in consideration of the poor and sick. Starting yesterday, it began providing free outpatient services in the old Eighth District and Hu Nan District. Poor patients in these areas who suffer from serious illnesses, cannot move, or cannot be exposed to the wind can first register at the Society, fill out an outpatient application form, and pay a registration fee of twenty yuan (initial consultation application time is from 9:00 to 10:00 AM, and follow-up consultation application time is from 7:30 to 9:00 AM). The Society will then send staff to investigate and verify the facts, and from 2:00 to 6:00 PM, they will provide outpatient services at the address. Those who cannot afford medication will also receive free medication. Daily outpatient services are temporarily limited to forty-eight people, and registration will be closed when the quota is full. The appointed doctors for the old Eighth District are Qin Bingyi, Wang Yiren, and Lu Xiaochun. The appointed doctors for the Hu Nan District are Gu Renji and Lang Shun. The Society's free outpatient service is a pioneering initiative in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Charity Sale of "Cough Relief"</h3>
<p>Sun Bonan, Guang Sheng, of the Weikang Pharmaceutical Society, wrote: "I am writing to inform you that common people often regard the onset of a cough as a minor ailment and do not pay attention to it, unaware that a persistent cough can easily develop into tuberculosis, which is extremely dangerous. Since the beginning of autumn this year, the climate has been changeable, and many people have contracted this disease. However, patients often cannot afford to buy medicine due to the high price, and suffer greatly. In view of this, our Society, based on a famous doctor's prescription, has specially produced 'Cough Relief' (Cucloin), which is made entirely with American raw materials and is specially designed to treat various coughs, such as bronchitis, phlegmatic asthma, and whooping cough in children. It can dissolve phlegm, relieve coughs, moisten the lungs, and calm asthma. The medicine tastes good, its effect is rapid, and its price is low, making it easy for the poor to purchase. We are sending four dozen bottles for charity sale, each bottle priced at 200 yuan. After deducting the cost of 120 yuan, the remaining 80 yuan will be donated to your organization's medical aid fund to help the poor."</p>
<h3>Master Ren Qi Donates Rubbings of Stone Tablets</h3>
<p>We have received twenty-two rubbings of stone tablets donated by Master Ren Zhai, with instructions to sell them for charity to raise money for poverty relief. His benevolence and righteous act are admirable. Among the tablets are "The Monument Commemorating the Propagation of the Nestorian Christian Church in China during the Great Tang Dynasty," "Yao Duo Bo's Sculptures," "Yue Fei's Calligraphy of the First and Second Memorials on Dispatching Troops," the "General's Tablet" of Guangwu, the "Hui Fu Temple Tablet," the "Yun Hui General's Tablet," and rubbings of tablets by He Shaoji, Zuo Zongtang, Mi Fu, Huang Tingjian, and Fei Zhao, all of which are the best of their time. All the items are now available for charity sale at our office. We hope that benevolent gentlemen will actively participate.</p>
<p>Request for School Supplies: The Zhi Shan Volunteer Elementary School has been established for three semesters. In view of the large number of out-of-school children in the Nanshi District, we plan to continue to run a second elementary school in the district. The school site has been found. We are now seeking to purchase school supplies. If you are willing to sell, please send a letter to No. 5, Lane 106, Da Xing Road.</p>
<h3>The China Association for the Protection of Children Calls on All Sectors to Donate Funds, with a Target of Five Million Yuan. This Office Can Also Collect Donations on Behalf.</h3>
<p>The China Association for the Protection of Children has been established for over ten years. Since the Incident (likely referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War), it has successively taken in over 10,000 refugee children. Currently, it still provides care for over 300 orphaned and impoverished children. The Association has no endowment fund and relies on donations from all sectors for its daily education and living expenses. Although it raised over two million yuan in February of this year, due to soaring prices, the expenses are enormous and fall far short of the budget, making it increasingly difficult to maintain. In addition to Lin Kanghou and Zhao Jinqing acting as guarantors for a overdraft of 500,000 yuan from the Xinhua Bank and Chen Bin contributing 10,000 yuan for routine expenses, the Association is already in debt to the tune of 800,000 yuan, making it truly unsustainable. Therefore, we have launched a fundraising campaign, earnestly hoping that enthusiastic people from all walks of life, with the spirit of "cherishing our young and extending that to the young of others," will generously donate to save the lives of 300 orphaned and impoverished children. In addition to sending donations directly to the Association, the Social Service Department of this newspaper can also collect donations on its behalf.</p>
<p>Receipt Report</p>

<h3>The Fundraising for the Home for the Aged Concludes, Still Hoping for a Continuous Flow of Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The fundraising campaign for the Shanghai Home for the Aged, which lasted for a month, has now come to an end. During this fundraising period, we received enthusiastic support from people of all walks of life, who either generously donated, economized and transferred savings, donated materials, or personally visited and observed. Although the results were not as satisfactory as expected, the nuns have already praised the benevolence and boundless gratitude. However, considering the high prices, the cost of rice, fuel, and salaries, although temporary peace can be achieved, it is ultimately difficult to remedy the long-term situation. Therefore, we still hope that benevolent gentlemen will generously donate and actively contribute, so that hundreds of frail and elderly people can be cared for in their final years. This is truly what the nuns sincerely wish and pray for. If you are willing to donate, this office will still collect donations on your behalf and transfer them as soon as they are received.</p>
<p>Charity Sale of Writing Instruments and Stationery for the Home for the Aged</p>
<p>Feng Yi Tang Writing Instrument and Stationery Store wrote: "We are writing to inform you that we have read in your newspaper about the fundraising for the Home for the Aged, which benefits widowers and widows and is of great significance. Our store cherishes the elderly and has compassion. We have decided to hold a charity sale for ten days from the 11th to the 20th of this month at our store at No. 144, Ding'an Road. The proceeds from the sale, after deducting expenses, will be donated to the Home to help with its expenses. We hope that this letter will be published so that all sectors can respond together and achieve the effect of collective effort."</p>
