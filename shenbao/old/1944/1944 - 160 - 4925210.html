<p>社評</p>
<h3>民權</h3>
<p>新聞報和本報主辦的戰時學術講座，先聘盟邦農業專家佐佐木博士主講，對於農業技術方而，指導增進生產方法，幷及世界各國農業情況，都有詳盡的觀察和獨到的意見。復聘友松圓諦教授又於上月底來滬，六月三日在上海廣播電台作廣播演講，闡述中國民族民權民生主義的眞意義和新精神，使我最新的解釋。</p>
<p>政府方屬有不嶼白民掖真意的，每多對於民權有所害怕，翅為有所害怕，每每贓以反對。其實民權是可以幫助政府行使治權的，正如友松敎授說：「所謂民權，並不是要從人民旁邊，主張自己的特權而拘束爲政者的權力的」，又說：「爲政者必須常常自己反省，常常甘於廉潔，公正，和清貧，常常傾耳於民意的呼聲，努力延求而使野無遺賢」，這是民權的眞意義。實在孫中山先生在三民主義裹，分析政權和治權的區別，極爲清楚，民權就是政權，屬於人民的，治權就是行政力量，屬於政府的。因爲人民有政權，政府然後可以依照民意行使治權，因爲人民有政權，政府然後可以加強他的治權，在東方民族，「民為貴」的民本傳統思想上，這是最理想的制度。主張民權的人的最大希望，就在政府依照民意去執行他的政策，同時人民竭誠的擁護執行民意政策的政府，人民決不拘束政府的治權，並且在政府執行民意政策時所遇到的困難，人民更願意設法解決。政府代替國民執行政策，人民自然竭誠維護。</p>
<p>更有人說，平時可有民權，戰時以戰爭爲先，民權爲次。不知正是因爲國家在戰爭時期，民權的需要更爲迫切。友松教授說：「百姓萬萬民若不奮起，國力是不能產生的明洽維新的標語是，庶民一途，使民不懈，萬機決於公論」。全體性戰爭需要全國人民的力量，政府的責任就在集中一切力量，凝結成功一個極大的力量，這個力量方是國力。所以國力的產生必由於國民的奮起，政府要領導國民奮起，希望國民發揮自已的力量，換句話說，要鼓勵人民發揮力量。所謂「萬衆一心，衆擎易舉」，平時旣極需要，戰時更爲緊急，友松教授說：「這樣一來，民意暢達，公論叢生，那末，中國便會於無意中成爲王道樂土的」。所以，凡是認識人民力量的，認識祇有人民整個的力量可以戰勝一切的，方才可以談到民權。沒有這個認識的，決不能領導人民奮起，不能領導人民奮起，就不能集合國力。</p>
<p>戰爭時期最重要的就是力量的集中，在大東亞圈內，每個國家單獨所有的力量先要集中，然後把各個國家的力量集中，把整個大東亞各國的力量，從事於大東亞戰爭，勝利是決定的，解放是當然的了。</p>
<h3>經盟邦名醫治療　汪主席政躬康復　褚外長返京發表赴日經過</h3>
<p>南京十一日中央社電　國府汪主席赴日養疴以來，經盟邦名醫悉心治療，政躬日見康復，舉國上下，異常欣慶。外交部褚部長近特專程飛日，恭省主席病狀，並陳國人關切之情，已於八日返國，十日由滬歸京。記者頃特　謁，叩詢此行經過，承談如下：「本人代表國府同人，於五月下旬，赴日恭叩主席，省視病狀，並傳達同人慰問之意，及國人關切之情。留日期間，敬代表主席向盟邦日本天皇以下朝野各界，表示謝意，並參拜伊勢·　原·明治·三神宮，及桃山御陵，靖國神社。分別設宴，恭請三笠宮殿下·東條首相·及諸位閣員，松平宮內大臣·杉山永野兩元帥，有田·山下兩顧問。同時出席三笠宮殿下茶會，松平·重光·靑木·石渡·諸大臣，有田·山下兩顧問，及　山社長·津田中將·各宴會。並參觀津田中將所領導之大東亞學寮。至本月七日，始公畢返國。八日飛返甲江，九日訪晤陳代主席，周代院長，報吿此行經過。並訪問盟邦在滬各機關長官。當晚出席近藤大將宴請，十日晚安抵首都，十一日晨恭謁國父陵寢，參加大唐三藏法師骨塔合尖典禮，中午赴昆　寺，參拜十一面觀音，視察浙江同鄉會修理工程。今明兩日十二日·十三日·分訪盟邦在京大使館，及陸海軍各機關長官，用敦禮義。主席政躬盟邦各醫悉心治療，日見康復，本人在日之時，曾偕盟邦主治各名醫，逐日晋見，主席病狀，深信數月之內必能復元。返京附此說明，以慰國人。</p>
<h3>政府穩定金融　調節農村通貨</h3>
<p>南京十一日中央社電　政府金融負責當局，而鑒於都市游資充斥，一般商人利用該項大量游資，任意操縱物資，企求暴利，其影響於統制經濟之完成，關係至大。爰於本年二三月間，竭力緊縮頭寸之供給，於是一時市面銀根驟緊，一般商人咸有週磚不靈之感，乃不得不將所囤物資，逐予傾吐。自此　緊　　　實施以來，　　相當效果，各項物價亦　以稍定，今後如能再進一步之徹底進行，則所有物資，不　全部引導於正當生產之　。　邇來都市銀根，在表面上固已很緊，賓際上此僅一般資本較小，運用力軟弱之中下級商人，經不起初步之頭寸緊縮，而即吐其所囤之物資。至尚有一部份資力雄厚者，則目前之緊縮程度，尚不足以迫使其傾吐囤貨，此實不容吾人忽視者。又目前農村通貨，在數量上亦較前增多，今後若無適當辦法，予以合理之處置，則前途亦未可樂觀。蓋邇來因大量收買農產物資，關係農村通貨，必然增多。而農村所需之工業用品，實際上仍不能適量供給，因此用於收買農產物之資金，不能回歸都市，而仍滯留於農村。長此以往，則農村通貨必呈膨脹現象無疑，如此則其結果實不堪設想。故以後在收買農產物方面，亟宜儘量誠少現金之數量，而儘可能，以工業物資交換。一方面對農村旣有通貨，竭力設法使之回歸，不使滯留，庶不致釀成惡果。綜上所述，關於再度緊縮都市銀根，及調節農村通貨兩點，深信有關當局，早已洞察利弊，而籌有有效對策，定能及早付之實施。則穩定金融，安定民生，與整個戰時經濟體制前途，實有無限光明。</p>
<h3>北緬戰局概况　英美渝軍進退維谷</h3>
<p>敵將史蒂威爾所部美渝聯合軍，在海上方面，企圖與敵美太平洋艦隊司令尼米資攻勢相呼應，開闢新援渝路綫；陸路方面抱着進攻日本本土的非份之圖；故自去年秋季以來，在緬甸北部富貢地區，督飭駐印度的渝軍三個師團作戰，妄圖打通萊多公路，結果富貢地區，築成屍山血河，敵軍連連敗北。本年三月初，敵方出動空中挺身部隊，以作孤注－擲。此項傘兵企圖擾亂富貢方面日軍部隊的後方補給路綫，並奪回北緬主要都市，經日軍部隊以神速行動，加以包圍攻擊，敵軍已瀕潰滅之途。但敵方本性不改，復在密芝那附近日軍後方，以渝軍編成的傘兵部隊降落，企圖與地上侵入的美國本國軍相呼應，一舉而下密芝那，從而與渡越怒江進攻的渝軍相聯繫，而在即將降臨的雨季以前，完全打通萊多公路，故出死力以爭。北緬現正展開的激烈攻防戰分誌如下。</p>
<p>富貢戰綫</p>
<p>該綫爲史蒂威爾所部聯合軍印度渝軍三師，英美軍兩旅。　榜着「到東京去的路」而在富貢地區出擊，並以號稱優勢的美空軍爲助，反攻七閱月。這其間爲日軍遂行出血作戰的絕好機會，敵方死亡纍纍，陷於不能戰鬥的狀態。加以雨季將近，氣候不良，美空軍復以死守伊姆法爾爲口實，協力趨於低調。打通萊多公里的企圖，乃歸粉碎。</p>
<p>空中部隊</p>
<p>千餘名，企圖　藉堅固如　要塞般的第一陣地抵抗，但　日印同盟軍陸空兩方面周密果敢的猛攻，及北緬民衆的勇敢奮鬥，敵軍陣地終於瓦解，向北潰走，再作第二處陣地，企圖再行切斷日軍補給綫，但經日軍猛攻結果，將其大半包範殲滅，幸而兎脫的一部份，在驟雨猛烈的緬甸北部森林中，苦於飢餓好疫厲，繼續徬徨於死途。</p>
<p>傘兵部隊</p>
<p>史蒂威的空中挺身部隊，失敗即在日前，雨季愈迫近，焦躁也愈甚，乃又在密芝那附近，以七八十架運輸機，往返派遣傘兵，再加上地面侵入的美兵一旅，企圖奪回密芝那，但日軍毫不放　，加以攻擊，不數日間，傘兵大部受擒或殲滅。現在殘部傘兵僅要求空中補給，以保殘命。東南亞洲反軸心軍聯合司令蒙特巴頓欲置重點於伊姆法爾周圍，而以打通萊多公路爲次要，故有拒絕援助史蒂威爾之勢。於此可見英美兩首腦，作戰意圖相違，同床異夢，破綻畢露。密芝那的傘兵旣無後援，亦惟有潰滅而已。</p>
<p>怒江作戰</p>
<p>美軍企圖打通大規模輸送兵力利物資，前往重慶的萊多公路，使其担任大東亞戰域陸上總反攻的前哨任務。史蒂威爾對於打通萊多公路的非份之圖，較之蒙特巴頓的絕對死守伊姆法爾，尤有甚焉。故計劃在眞正的雨季到達前，在騰越北部，便自富貢東進的駐印渝軍，與怒江西岸的雲南軍相連緊張。結果，雲南軍一師團，乃渡怒江，進擊日軍側面，交戰旬日，遺屍　　，演成「怒江的悲劇」。</p>
<p>該方面連日雨雲低罩戰綫，駐渝美軍難以活躍，第一綫將兵乃向強制渡江的史蒂威爾哀求自空中補給糧秣與彈藥，當　主要作戰的富貢區，空軍對傘兵部隊援助不力之際，對於怒江戰綫的協力，當然是不可能的了。（譯自五月二十九日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>日軍進抵益陽　長沙效外激戰　日機轟炸零陵衡陽</h3>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍當局十日發表，長沙郊外防衛綫，九日仍繼續激戰。撈刀河北方之砲兵陣地，終日猛　長沙省城。</p>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍當局十日發表，日軍已於六月九日進抵長沙西北方之益陽郊外，目下在激戰中</p>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍當局十日發表，日軍已抵達長沙東方六十公里之瀏陽郊外。</p>
<p>重創渝軍空軍基地</p>
<p>中國方面某基地十一日中央社電　日機於十日晨曾轟炸渝美空軍基地，湖南省之零陵及衡陽兩機塲，對企圖援助渝第六戰區及第九戰區，而行反攻之美空軍，予以痛烈之打擊。急襲零陵之日機，曾於黑夜中與渝戰鬥機激烈空戰，同時並實施低空轟炸，使其四處起火，故其機塲及軍事設施，盡化爲瓦礫。且擊毀其小型戰鬥機九架外，有二架起火。又攻擊衡陽機塲之日機，亦曾予以痛擊，並使小型機二架起火，故轟炸零陵及衡陽之日機，均獲得重大戰果，而安返基地。</p>
<p>粵淸鄉公署剿滅游匪</p>
<p>廣州十一日中央社電　粵省自東寶地區淸鄉督察專員公署成立後，對於淸鄉工作銳意推行。軍事方面與第四十五師部隊緊密協力，淸剿游匪。本月五日淸晨四時許，有共匪千餘來襲第三十師防地，爲該師第八十八團部隊迎頭痛擊，戰至拂曉，團長林復承派部隊馳赴實行剿擊，匪衆不敵，分向大嶺巴白石巴方而竄退。是役作戰達五小時許，鹵獲敵匪械彈甚多，匪衆傷亡甚衆，遺屍數十只。該署許兼署長，對於此次得力官兵，已馳領嘉獎，以勵來茲。</p>
<h3>英美掉首不顧　渝方大失所望　—鹽田大尉發表談話——</h3>
<p>英軍在法國北部登陸揭開侵歐作戰之序幕後，渝方平日所大事號召之「先並洲後歐洲」策路，已成爲相反之事實，終不免受英美欺騙墮其奸計，日駐華艦隊報道部鹽田大尉，昨就此事發表談話如次：</p>
<p>尼米　自在中部太平作開始攻勢後，淪方即對民衆宣傳稱，此爲開羅會談之當然結果，或稱德黑蘭會議中決定之作戰，並揚言此即「先亞後歐默」之意思，揆諸用意，不外企圖防止民心背離。</p>
<p>羅斯福邱吉爾兩人乘此機會大肆政治上的謀略，以奠定他日侵入中國之基礎，華萊士爲處理渝方最感煩惱之國共調整問題，刻正在西伯利亞靜候機會，渝方指導者受英美奸計之欺朦，不明英美作戰計劇，直至六日晨聯合軍侵入歐洲時爲止，猶動員報紙與電合，高呼先亞後歐之口號。重慶曾經向世界發言稱：自開羅會議後，已列世界四大強國之一，此實可笑亦復可憐。在日軍河南作戰中，戰區民衆不安日甚之時，聯合軍侵入歐洲之消息，亦足使民衆對指導者之信仰一落千丈。</p>
<p>渝方宣傳部長梁寒操七日曾向記者述稱：「前日攻入歐洲作戰之消息一度侵入我國後，我國民咸異常興奮。此可對日本予以重大打擊，而促進抗戰勝利之完成。」言詞中甚少提及攻入歐洲問題，　梁寒操渠所提倡以「先之後歐」之口號已成相反之事實，內心當感到極度憤懣與焦躁。C·D·N·重慶特派員則稱：「重慶地區大多數民衆認爲歐洲問題並不直接影響到中國。故不表示關心云。</p>
<p>重慶雖然宣傳先攻取洲已久。但在此次尼米茲攻勢中，日軍戰略態勢，依然固如金塲，在東西兩戰局上渝方指導者，對於如怒濤進擊之日軍，深感膽怯，除安慰自己以外，惟以自列四大強國爲榮，但即使渝方指導者努力抗戰，如果僅依賴美國之太平洋攻勢與英國之侵歐作戰，則彼等常常受英美利用代人受過，不得不徒以宣傳隱瞞民衆，敷衍了事云。</p>
<h3>諾曼第防綫淹水　沿岸地帶成澤國　柯坦汀半島爭奪戰熾烈</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十一日中央社電　據反軸心歐洲遠征司令路透社隨軍特派員斯蒂茵訊：諾曼第海岸德軍重要防綫一部，注入洪水後，反軸心軍連絡已感困難，自柯坦汀半島（Cotentin）周圍維爾河口起至聖瑪利地帶西方盡成澤國，其東自　格尼（Lsigny)一帶起殆無高出海面之地點，且各河川間之道路因無後陵關係，德軍亦引入洪水予以淹沒，至於柯坦汀半島西南一帶大丘陵及各　綫上，德軍正陰止反軸心軍前進，農展開激戰中。</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　德軍當局十日發表：柯坦汀半島仍由德軍確保中，但位於維爾河口之　格尼則早已放棄。</p>
<p>巴猶周圍陷於混戰</p>
<p>瑞典京城十一日中央社電　反軸心軍北法登作戰第四日最堪注目者，即柯坦灑半島美軍已顯著增強。九日起已開始大規模之出動，德方亦曾承認上項事實。據倫敦電，該地美軍雖曾橫斷卡倫坦，瑟堡公路數處，然德軍反攻仍極激烈。艾森霍華司令部十日發表第十次戰報中亦稱：瑟繼東部目下展開激戰，該地已有強大之德軍機甲部隊參加作戰。同時克恩至維爾河口一帶戰事亦趨激烈，巴猶南方及克恩一帶似已展開戰車戰。據美聯社倫敦電，德軍第二十一戰車師團刻已出動克恩地方，德軍第十二戰車師團亦已出動巴猶地方。巴猶東南　特修爾斯萊附近，反軸心軍已與強有力之德軍接觸，致巴猶周圍已陷混戰狀態，反軸心軍橋頭堡之間殘存之德軍要塞，依然繼續抵抗。傳反軸心軍之軍艦砲亦恐傷及自軍未能轟擊。</p>
<h3>侵歐軍在法境　設前綫司令部</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十一日中央社電　據倫敦傳稱，蒙高茂萊已在橋頭堡設置前綫司令部，美第九航空隊本部亦移至法境。</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　據德軍當局發表：法國北部之反軸心軍，已於過去二十四小時內獲得增援部隊，刻正擴大橋頭堡中。</p>
<p>英美會師德不重視</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　海通社訊：奧納與維爾兩河口間之英軍橋頭堡，與柯坦汀半島東南部之美軍橋頭堡已獲連接，英軍渡過維爾運河，與卡倫坦及聖瑪利之美軍取得接觸，但德軍負責方面，並不認此項會師有何重要意義。以巴猶區內之英軍及卡倫坦與蒙特堡間之美軍，均不能擴大其橋頭堡，以便同時出動勁旅進行攻勢，同時美軍藉重坦克車之助，企圖北向瑟堡拓展其橋頭堡，某一點已抵蒙特堡與基奈維爾間之公路，但上述聖瑪利向西突擊之美軍亦被擊退。</p>
<p>防軍力量證明雄厚</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　德軍事記者報吿稱：自反軸心軍登陸以來，僅數百平方公里海岸地區之戰爭，即達百餘小時，且該地區，決非全部落入敵人手中，尙有若干地點，爲德軍之基地及要塞，正從事抵抗中。奧納及維爾兩河口之中間地域，於過去十二小時內，反軸心軍橋頭堡之深度，已平均增深十公里。又敵軍越過維爾河欲向西南方擴大其橋頭堡，以期與卡倫坦北方之部隊取得聯絡，過去數小時以來，艾森霍華因反軸心軍左翼，蒙受重創，遂將注意力移轉至右翼，預料敵爲奪取柯坦汀半島，恐將採取新攻勢。迄今爲止，若通觀北法方面之戰況，其中令人注目者，可分下列數點：　德軍力量之雄厚，已證明非　。　德後備軍已於數處將敵軍驅逐至　　之地區內，其他各地之後備軍，則尙在枕戈待命中。　奧納河口及迭維中間有力之敵軍，已被擊　，而迭維河東方至哈佛，英加兩軍勢力已趨薄弱，刻正陷於　　狀態中。　自作戰開始以來，諾曼第方面之敵軍，除有數千人被俘外，尙損失運輸車一千二百輛，及坦克車二百輛，戰死者則超過俘虜數倍以上，</p>
<p>德軍戰略誘敵深入</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　德軍當局十日正午發表：　反軸心軍歐洲登陸作戰，大約在今後數小時或數日之後，即人於第二階叚。現在之作戰乃其初步，反軸心軍已佔領極廣泛且寬大之海岸，其在此等地帶已佈滿新銳部隊。然以現在之情形觀之，敵軍用盡全力，僅得保持旣得之陣地，今後數日內行將展開第二階段之陸上戰鬥。此次登陸作戰，當可決定大戰之歸趨，德軍最高司令部主張不阻止反軸心軍登陸，誘敵侵入後，再將之完全殲滅。　反軸心登陸今後之目標，在越過維爾河向西北進，與聖瑪利及坎伯附近之反軸心軍取得連絡，敵方雖有廣泛之登陸地點，惟無較大港灣，反軸心軍於行將取得連絡時，爲佔領瑟堡以爲作戰基地，乃圖切斷柯坦汀半島，德軍於事前派遣大兵前往應戰。以德軍言，現在之戰鬥尙在初期，德軍刻僅以最初之戰略豫備軍參加橋頭堡戰鬥。　杜佛海峽至比斯　間海上敵艦船極活躍，料此或爲新登陸作戰之牽制行動，總之德軍迄今或尙未開始艾森霍華所希望之正式攻勢</p>
<p>登陸母艦一艘擊沉</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　德海軍民快速艇隊現在夜襲反軸心登陸艦隊及船團，擾亂敵之登陸作戰。據德軍當局發表：九日晚至十日晨，德軍快速艇隊自北方突入塞納灣之中部水城，發雷擊中五千噸之敵船，該船當即爆炸沉沒，尙有二千噸船二艘亦被魚雷擊沉。被沉之五千噸船，前曾爲英法海峽之連絡船，此次登陸作戰之前改裝成小型登陸用艇母艦，然其搭載之小艇數量尙不詳細，以規模觀之，至少能載登陸舟艇（搭載九十六人者）二十艘。</p>
<h3>法勞働部長　勗勉國人</h3>
<p>巴黎十一日中央社電　法國勞働部長迭氏雅，十日在巴黎演說，切望法人在反軸心軍於北法登陸時，一致奮起，其大意謂，刻在諾曼第展開之戰鬥，即代表全權主義之世界與代表社會正義之世界所展開之大鬥爭。余相信德軍於是役必能獲勝，同時余對法國之復興，亦具有同樣之信念，實則決定法國命運之時機今已到來，法人必須放棄旁觀主義，積極貢獻於此空前之大鬥爭。</p>
<p>義王儲遇刺未中</p>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　海通社訊，羅馬消息：義國太子恩勃托遇刺未中，當時兇手開槍數響，立即逃逸。</p>
<p>蘇省垣中學生演說競賽</p>
<p>蘇州十一日中央社電　東亞聯盟中國總會江蘇分會，昨日下午二時，在淸鄉紀念館舉行省垣中學生東聯思想演說競賽會。計出席各校學生代表二十一人，聽講學生千餘人。行禮如儀後，由該分會袁書記長任主席，高　安報吿召開競賽會意義，即開始演說競賽。由敎育廳敎育局及該分會評判結果，旋即分發獎品，第一名得銀盾一座，現金一千元，第二名得銀盾一座，現金五百元，第三名得銀盾一座，現金三百元。分發獎品畢，即高呼口號，情況致爲熱烈，至六時許始散會。</p>

<h3>各米店將實行　自由買賣食米　現正積極從事辦工作</h3>
<p>關於穩定本巿民食問題，當局正從各方面採用有效之措置，為鼓勵採辦商。米店·及農民盡量採運米糧來滬，及嚴懲不法商民囤積居奇，與取締沿途勒索等事，莫不十分重視，積極推行。自六月二日市政府佈吿，在本市米糧搬入口管理辦法米公佈以前，各採辦商及附近農民搬運米穀來滬者，得免領護照及證明單，自由進入木市各搬入口，其數量亦不予限制，發表後，速日運滬之米，已不在少數，且完全充作民食之用，而市內各米店亦均有相當準備，除南市閘北·西等地各米店食米巳在自由買賈外，設在第一區內經營配給米之米店與百餘家，於昨日推派代表晋謁第一區公署當局，陳述情形，並請示方針，聞該業已獲得當局之允許，在搬入口管理辦法未公佈以前，准許該業參加自由買賣，並將逐日買賣米糧情形報告主管機關，以資稀考，現區內各米店正在積極從事採購進貨，忙於準備，不日即可應市云。</p>
<p>戶口麵粉即可增配</p>
<p>近日本巿食米來源欠暢，備格高漲，市府當局至為汪意，正在續極籌措補救辦法，藉蘇民困。閘糧食局及一區經濟處己與粉麥專業委員會等有關方面連日接洽籌備，擬先將戶口麵粉即可增配粉之配給比較向例增加一倍，俾本市民食可以稍加節，即從來全市戶口麵粉每月配給總數約二十二萬包，現擬增至每月配給四十四萬包，對於原料採集及麵粉製造，正在積極籌畫中，惟因手績關係，對於六月上旬所配給之戶口麵粉，仍按原定每人配給頭號麵粉一市斤。但擬增加配給苞米粉半巿斤，約共需增加四萬包。本月十三日即可憑綜合配給證第三號普遍發售，至於戶口麵粉增加一倍之配給，希望能自六月中旬或下旬開始實現，又聞本月戶口麵粉之配給，當局決計設法配足三期云。</p>
<h3>東方文化編譯館　昨開成立會　即日起開始編譯工作</h3>
<p>中日文化協會滬分會，為研究東方文化新建設，溝通中日文化，近特聘請滬地中日文化界知名之士，組織東方文化編譯館，從事出版事業。該館昨（十一）日下午舉行首次董事會，計到中田書記官·小竹文夫·林廣吉·吉田東祐·趙正平·李權時·吳湖帆·陳彬龢等十餘人，首由主席陳彬龢氏致開會詞及說明成立意義，旋即通過董事會人選及工作計劃，至傍晚始行散會。聞該館館址設於咸陽路中日文化協會內，即日開始編譯工作云。</p>
<h3>松江縣的米糧輸出近況</h3>
<p>大陸新報記者竹木氏調查崑山方面米糧情形吿終後，繼赴「松江米」集散地松江，歷訪米統會辦事處，米業同業公會，日方各商社，華方採辦同業公會籌備委員會，縣政府，縣合作社，及其他關係機關，調查松江米糧問題，及向上海搬出問題。米糧間題在該地亦為目前最重要問題，關係當局對之頗為棘手，而痛感有迅即確立打開中央，地方一體化方針之必要。松江向為經鐵道，公路，水路倫運最盛之地，且亦為受此次米糧新措置影響最深刻之地區。今後之米糧對策，不應僅從上海立塲出發，而必須以松江，崑山等上海周圍產米區為前提而作綜合的有計劃之推進。為上海民生而　　松江民生，或為松江民生而犧牲上海民生，均非所望，而亟盼實施包括各生產地各消費地之米糧收買配給之新方針。上述要求，決非從抽象論出發者，乃從松江縣政府所遭遇之具體實情而生者，因此，國府及米統會如何處理此要求，頗堪注意。松江縣政府所遭遇之米糧問題，大槪如次：</p>
<p>縣政府的對策</p>
<p>松江米糧巿價於四月二十九日開始激漲，至五月上句，已漲百分之九十，共後漲勢稍緩，六月三日以來，漸見跌落，此與其謂為上海米糧市價跌落之影響所致，不如謂為松江縣政府於六月三日採取米價抑制策以緊急應付米價暴漲之結果。自四月二十九日以降，迄六月二日止，自松江或經松江米商之手向上海搬出之米糧，估計約達十萬石。因利用鐵道，公路：水路之數千石米糧搬出者，繼續有將松江米糧搬運至上海之傾向，長此以往，恐將在確保松江民食上，造成重大障害，縣政府乃會同各關係機關硏究防止方策。該對策內容為：</p>
<p>一，松江米糧抑制最高至四千元。</p>
<p>二，禁止〇公斤以上米糧之搬出。</p>
<p>六月三日發出該佈吿後，數日之內，米店不得已停業，後經米業公會陳述種理由，尤以四千元之最高巿價，以視上海巿價，失之過低，而向常局訴願。結果，乃決定五千五百元為縣政府之公認最高市價，而米店則負責對松江城區民衆　市民證每次販賣食米五市斤。當然佈吿後陸續搬出者仍達相當數量。此雖非如上海一樣之配給制度，但至少可視為靑黃不接期配給制度之臨時的萌芽現象，堪予注目。上述事實，說明上海搬入問題，應基於與各地區搬出問題之合理的關聯上兼顧並　之綜合計劃，對各主要消費地之氏食對策，亟盼實施一元的指導。（翔：譯自六月十一日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>Civil Rights</h3>
<p>The wartime academic lectures jointly sponsored by the News Daily and this newspaper first hired Dr. Sasaki, an agricultural expert from an Allied nation, to lecture on agricultural technology, providing guidance on improving production methods, and giving detailed observations and unique insights on the agricultural situation in various countries around the world. Professor Yūki Tomotsune was then invited and arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month. On June 3rd, he gave a radio address on Shanghai Radio, elaborating on the true meaning and new spirit of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, giving us the latest explanation.</p>
<p>Some in the government, rather than seeking the true intention of the common people, are often afraid of civil rights, and because of this fear, often oppose them. In fact, civil rights can help the government exercise its governing power, just as Professor Yūki said: "So-called civil rights do not mean advocating one's own privileges alongside the people and restricting the power of those in government." He also said: "Those in government must constantly reflect on themselves, always be willing to be honest, just, and poor, always listen to the voices of the people, and strive to seek out and not overlook talent." This is the true meaning of civil rights. Indeed, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, in the Three Principles of the People, analyzed the distinction between political power and governing power extremely clearly: civil rights are political power, belonging to the people; governing power is administrative power, belonging to the government. Because the people have political power, the government can then exercise governing power in accordance with the will of the people; because the people have political power, the government can then strengthen its governing power. In the Eastern national tradition of "the people are paramount," this is the most ideal system. The greatest hope of those who advocate civil rights lies in the government carrying out its policies in accordance with the will of the people, while the people wholeheartedly support the government that implements policies based on the will of the people. The people will never restrict the government's governing power, and will be even more willing to find ways to solve the difficulties the government encounters when implementing policies based on the will of the people. When the government implements policies on behalf of the people, the people will naturally wholeheartedly maintain it.</p>
<p>Some even say that civil rights are acceptable in peacetime, but in wartime, war comes first and civil rights come second. Little do they know that it is precisely because the country is at war that the need for civil rights is even more urgent. Professor Yūki said: "If the hundreds of millions of people do not rise up, national strength cannot be generated. The slogan of the Meiji Restoration was, 'Enlighten the common people, keep the people tireless, and decide all matters through public opinion.'" Total war requires the strength of the entire nation. The government's responsibility is to concentrate all forces, condensing them into one extremely great force, and this force is national strength. Therefore, the generation of national strength must come from the rise of the people. The government must lead the people to rise up, hoping that the people will exert their own strength; in other words, it must encourage the people to exert their strength. The saying "With the hearts of all the people united, lifting is easy" is extremely necessary in peacetime, and even more urgent in wartime. Professor Yūki said: "In this way, public opinion will be readily conveyed, and public discourse will flourish. Then, China will unintentionally become a paradise of the Kingly Way." Therefore, only those who recognize the power of the people, and recognize that only the entire power of the people can defeat everything, can talk about civil rights. Those who do not have this understanding cannot lead the people to rise up, and if they cannot lead the people to rise up, they cannot gather national strength.</p>
<p>The most important thing in wartime is the concentration of power. Within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the individual strength of each country must first be concentrated, and then the strength of each country must be concentrated to devote the strength of all the countries of Greater East Asia to the Greater East Asia War. Victory is certain, and liberation is inevitable.</p>
<h3>After Treatment by Allied Doctors, Chairman Wang's Health Restored; Foreign Minister Chu Returns to Nanjing to Report on His Trip to Japan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since Chairman Wang of the National Government went to Japan to recuperate, his health has been improving day by day under the careful treatment of Allied doctors, which has been a cause for great joy throughout the country. Foreign Minister Chu recently made a special trip to Japan to respectfully inquire about the Chairman's condition, and to convey the concerns of the people of the country. He returned to the country on the 8th, and returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 10th. This reporter made a special visit to inquire about the details of his trip. He shared the following: "I, on behalf of the National Government, went to Japan in late May to respectfully inquire about the Chairman's condition, to inspect his illness, and to convey the regards of my colleagues and the concerns of the people of the country. During my stay in Japan, I respectfully expressed thanks on behalf of the Chairman to all sectors of Allied Japan, from the Emperor down to officials and the public. I also visited the Ise, Kasuga, Meiji, and Three Shrines, as well as the Momoyama Imperial Mausoleum and the Yasukuni Shrine. I held separate banquets, respectfully inviting Prince Mikasa, Prime Minister Tōjō, and various cabinet members, Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira, Marshals Sugiyama and Nagano, and Advisors Arita and Yamashita. At the same time, I attended a tea party held by Prince Mikasa, and banquets hosted by Ministers Matsudaira, Shigemitsu, Aoki, and Ishiwatari, and Advisors Arita and Yamashita, as well as President Yoshizawa and General Tsuda. I also visited the Greater East Asia Academy led by General Tsuda. I completed my official duties and returned to the country on the 7th of this month. On the 8th, I flew back to Shanghai, and on the 9th, I visited Acting Chairman Chen and Acting President Zhou to report on my trip. I also visited the heads of Allied agencies in Shanghai. That evening, I attended a banquet hosted by General Kondo. On the evening of the 10th, I arrived safely in the capital. On the morning of the 11th, I respectfully visited the mausoleum of the Founding Father, and attended the joint stupa ceremony for the bones of the Great Tang Sanzang Master. At noon, I went to the Kunyuan Temple to worship the Eleven-Faced Guanyin, and inspected the repair work of the Zhejiang Compatriots Association. Over the next two days, the 12th and 13th, I will visit the embassies of Allied nations in Nanjing, as well as the heads of various army and navy agencies, to maintain proper decorum. The Allied doctors are providing meticulous treatment to Chairman Wang, and his health is improving day by day. During my stay in Japan, I accompanied the Allied attending physicians to visit him daily, and I am convinced that he will recover within a few months. I am adding this to my report upon returning to Nanjing to comfort the people of the country."</p>
<h3>Government Stabilizes Finance, Regulates Rural Currency</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) The government's financial authorities, in view of the abundance of idle capital in urban areas and the fact that general merchants are using this large amount of idle capital to arbitrarily manipulate goods in pursuit of exorbitant profits, which has a significant impact on the completion of the controlled economy, made every effort to tighten the supply of funds in February and March of this year. As a result, the money market suddenly tightened, and general merchants felt a sense of illiquidity, forcing them to gradually dump their hoarded goods. Since the implementation of this tightening policy, it has had a considerable effect, and the prices of various goods have stabilized somewhat. If it can be further implemented thoroughly in the future, then all goods will inevitably be guided towards proper production. In recent times, urban credit has been very tight on the surface, but in reality, only lower- and middle-level merchants with smaller capital and weaker operating capacity cannot withstand the initial tightening of funds, and immediately release their hoarded goods. As for those with stronger financial resources, the current degree of tightening is not enough to force them to dump their stockpiles, which is something we cannot ignore. In addition, the amount of currency in rural areas is also increasing compared to before. If there is no appropriate way to deal with it reasonably in the future, the future is not optimistic. This is because the large-scale purchase of agricultural products inevitably leads to an increase in rural currency. However, the industrial supplies needed by rural areas cannot actually be supplied in appropriate quantities, so the funds used to purchase agricultural products cannot return to urban areas, but remain in rural areas. If this continues, rural currency will undoubtedly show signs of inflation, and the consequences would be disastrous. Therefore, in the future, in terms of purchasing agricultural products, we should minimize the amount of cash as much as possible, and exchange them for industrial materials as much as possible. On the one hand, we should make every effort to bring the existing currency in rural areas back to urban areas, and prevent it from remaining there, so as not to cause undesirable consequences. In summary, regarding the two points of tightening urban credit again and regulating rural currency, it is deeply believed that the relevant authorities have long been aware of the advantages and disadvantages, and have formulated effective countermeasures, and will implement them as soon as possible. Then the stabilization of finance, the stabilization of people's livelihood, and the future of the entire wartime economic system will be infinitely bright.</p>
<h3>General Overview of the Northern Burma War Situation: British, American, and Chongqing Forces in a Dilemma</h3>
<p>The U.S.-Chongqing Allied forces under the command of enemy General Stilwell, on the maritime front, attempted to echo the offensive of U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz to open up a new supply route to Chongqing. On the land front, they harbored the unrealistic plan of attacking the Japanese mainland. Therefore, since the autumn of last year, in the Hugong area of northern Burma, they supervised the three divisions of Chongqing forces stationed in India to fight, vainly attempting to open the Ledo Road. As a result, the Hugong area was built into a mountain of corpses and a river of blood, and the enemy forces were repeatedly defeated. At the beginning of March of this year, the enemy dispatched airborne troops, making a desperate gamble. These paratroopers attempted to disrupt the rear supply lines of the Japanese forces in the Hugong area and recapture the major cities of northern Burma. However, the Japanese forces took swift action to encircle and attack them, and the enemy forces were on the verge of collapse. However, the enemy did not change its nature, and again used a Chongqing army-formed airborne unit to land in the rear of the Japanese forces near Myitkyina, attempting to echo the American forces invading on the ground, to take Myitkyina in one fell swoop, and then connect with the Chongqing army advancing across the Nujiang River. Before the imminent rainy season, they would completely open up the Ledo Road, so they were fighting desperately. The fierce offensive and defensive battles currently unfolding in northern Burma are described below.</p>
<p>Hugong Front</p>
<p>This line consists of three divisions of the Indian-Chongqing army and two brigades of British and American troops under the command of Stilwell. They attacked in the Hugong area with the slogan "The Road to Tokyo" and with the assistance of the so-called superior U.S. Air Force, counterattacking for seven months. During this period, it was an excellent opportunity for the Japanese army to carry out a war of attrition. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and was in a state of inability to fight. In addition, the rainy season was approaching, the climate was bad, and the U.S. Air Force used the defense of Imphal as an excuse to reduce its cooperation. The attempt to open the Ledo Road was shattered.</p>
<p>Airborne Troops</p>
<p>Thousands of troops attempted to resist by relying on the first line of defense, which was as solid as a fortress. However, due to the careful and decisive attacks by the Japanese-Indian Allied forces on land and in the air, and the brave struggle of the people of northern Burma, the enemy's position finally collapsed. They retreated north and built a second position, attempting to cut off the Japanese supply line again. However, after a fierce attack by the Japanese army, most of them were encircled and annihilated. The few who escaped were suffering from hunger and disease in the torrential rains of the northern Burmese forests, and continued to wander towards death.</p>
<p>Paratrooper Troops</p>
<p>Stilwell's airborne troops had just failed, and as the rainy season approached, they became increasingly impatient. They then dispatched paratroopers in seven or eighty transport planes to the vicinity of Myitkyina, and added a brigade of American troops invading on the ground, attempting to recapture Myitkyina. However, the Japanese army did not let them go, and attacked them. Within a few days, most of the paratroopers were captured or annihilated. Now, the remaining paratroopers are only asking for air supplies to preserve their lives. Mountbatten, the commander of the anti-Axis Allied forces in Southeast Asia, wanted to focus on the area around Imphal and make the opening of the Ledo Road secondary, so he refused to assist Stilwell. From this, we can see that the heads of Britain and the United States have conflicting operational intentions and harbor different dreams, and their flaws are fully exposed. The paratroopers in Myitkyina have no support and can only be annihilated.</p>
<p>Nujiang Operations</p>
<p>The U.S. military attempted to open up the Ledo Road, a large-scale transportation route for troops and supplies to Chongqing, to make it serve as the forward post for the general land counteroffensive in the Greater East Asia war zone. Stilwell's unrealistic plan to open up the Ledo Road was even greater than Mountbatten's absolute defense of Imphal. Therefore, he planned that before the real rainy season arrived, the Indian-Chongqing army advancing east from Hugong would connect with the Yunnan army on the west bank of the Nujiang River in northern Tengchong. As a result, a division of the Yunnan army crossed the Nujiang River and attacked the Japanese army's flank. After ten days of fighting, corpses were left everywhere, and the "Tragedy of the Nujiang River" unfolded.</p>
<p>In that area, rain clouds covered the front line for days, making it difficult for the U.S. military stationed in Chongqing to be active. The generals on the front line begged Stilwell, who had forced them to cross the river, to supply food and ammunition from the air. At a time when the Air Force was providing inadequate assistance to the paratroopers in the main operational area of Hugong, it was of course impossible to cooperate on the Nujiang front. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, May 29)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Advances to Yiyang; Fierce Fighting on the Outskirts of Changsha; Japanese Planes Bomb Lingling and Hengyang</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing army authorities announced on the 10th that fierce fighting continued on the 9th on the defensive line on the outskirts of Changsha. Artillery positions north of the Laodao River fiercely shelled Changsha, the provincial capital, all day long.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing army authorities announced on the 10th that the Japanese army had advanced to the outskirts of Yiyang, northwest of Changsha, on June 9, and was currently engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing army authorities announced on the 10th that the Japanese army had reached the outskirts of Liuyang, 60 kilometers east of Changsha.</p>
<p>Heavily Damage Chongqing Army Air Force Base</p>
<p>A certain base in China, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) Japanese planes bombed the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force base, the Lingling and Hengyang airfields in Hunan Province, on the morning of the 10th, dealing a severe blow to the U.S. Air Force, which was attempting to aid the Chongqing Sixth and Ninth War Zones and launch a counteroffensive. The Japanese planes that raided Lingling engaged in a fierce dogfight with Chongqing fighter planes in the dark, and also carried out low-altitude bombing, causing fires everywhere, so that the airfield and military facilities were reduced to rubble. In addition, they destroyed nine small fighter planes and set two on fire. The Japanese planes that attacked the Hengyang airfield also inflicted heavy damage and set two small planes on fire. Therefore, the Japanese planes that bombed Lingling and Hengyang achieved significant results and returned safely to their bases.</p>
<p>Guangdong Rural Clearing Office Eliminates Roaming Bandits</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since the establishment of the Rural Clearing Supervisory Commissioner's Office in the Dongbao area of Guangdong Province, it has been determined to promote rural clearing work. On the military front, it closely cooperated with the 45th Division to eliminate roaming bandits. At around 4:00 AM on the 5th of this month, more than a thousand communist bandits attacked the defense area of the 30th Division. They were met with a head-on attack by the 88th Regiment of the division. The fighting lasted until dawn. Regiment Commander Lin Fu-cheng dispatched troops to carry out the suppression. The bandits were no match and fled towards Dalingba, Baishi, and other areas. The battle lasted for about five hours, and many bandit weapons and ammunition were seized. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, leaving dozens of bodies behind. Commissioner Xu, who also serves as the director of the office, has telegraphed awards to the meritorious officers and soldiers to encourage future efforts.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Turn a Blind Eye, Chongqing Greatly Disappointed - Statement by Captain Shiota -</h3>
<p>After the British landed in northern France, opening the prelude to the invasion of Europe, Chongqing's "Asia First, Europe Second" strategy, which it had been vigorously advocating, became the opposite of reality. In the end, it could not avoid being deceived by Britain and the United States and falling into their trap. Captain Shiota of the Japanese Naval Fleet Reporting Department in China issued the following statement on this matter yesterday:</p>
<p>After Nimitz launched an offensive in the central Pacific, Chongqing immediately propagated to the public that this was the natural result of the Cairo Conference, or the operation decided at the Tehran Conference, and declared that this was the meaning of "Asia First, Europe Second." Its intention was nothing more than to prevent the people's hearts from turning away.</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Churchill took this opportunity to carry out large-scale political maneuvers to lay the foundation for their future invasion of China. Wallace is currently waiting in Siberia for an opportunity to deal with the most troubling issue for Chongqing, the adjustment of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The leaders of Chongqing, deceived by the plots of Britain and the United States, did not understand the operational strategies of Britain and the United States. Until the morning of the 6th, when the Allied forces invaded Europe, they were still mobilizing newspapers and telegraphs to shout the slogan of "Asia First, Europe Second." Chongqing once declared to the world that it had become one of the four great powers since the Cairo Conference, which is both ridiculous and pathetic. At a time when the people in the war zone were increasingly uneasy during the Japanese army's operation in Henan, the news of the Allied forces' invasion of Europe was enough to make the people's faith in their leaders plummet.</p>
<p>Liang Han-tsao, Minister of Propaganda for Chongqing, told reporters on the 7th: "The news of the attack on Europe yesterday has once again invaded our country, and our people are extremely excited. This can deal a heavy blow to Japan and promote the completion of the War of Resistance." His words rarely mentioned the issue of the attack on Europe. Liang Han-tsao must have felt extreme anger and anxiety in his heart that the slogan of "Asia First, Europe Second" that he advocated had become the opposite of reality. A special correspondent for C.D.N. in Chongqing said: "Most of the people in the Chongqing area believe that the European issue does not directly affect China. Therefore, they do not express concern."</p>
<p>Although Chongqing has been promoting the conquest of Asia for a long time, in this Nimitz offensive, the strategic posture of the Japanese army remained as solid as a golden wall. On both the Eastern and Western fronts, the leaders of Chongqing were deeply frightened by the Japanese army's surging attacks. Apart from comforting themselves, they only took pride in being one of the four great powers. But even if the leaders of Chongqing work hard to resist the war, if they only rely on the U.S. Pacific offensive and the British invasion of Europe, then they will often be used by Britain and the United States to take the blame for others, and have no choice but to deceive the public with propaganda to muddle through.</p>
<h3>Normandy Defense Line Flooded, Coastal Area Becomes Water Country, Fierce Battle for Cotentin Peninsula</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a report from Reuters correspondent Stein, who is with the anti-Axis European Expeditionary Force: After the Allied forces flooded part of the German army's important defensive line on the Normandy coast, communication has become difficult. The area from the mouth of the Vire River around the Cotentin Peninsula to the west of Sainte-Mère-Église has become a water country. East of Lsigny, there is almost no point above sea level, and the German army has also flooded the roads between the rivers due to the lack of high ground. The German army is preventing the Allied forces from advancing on the large hills and various lines in the southwest of the Cotentin Peninsula, and fierce fighting is unfolding.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German military authorities announced on the 10th that the Cotentin Peninsula is still being secured by the German army, but Lsigny, located at the mouth of the Vire River, has long been abandoned.</p>
<p>The Area Around Bayeux Falls into Chaos</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) The most noteworthy aspect of the fourth day of the Allied forces' landing operation in northern France is that the U.S. military on the Cotentin Peninsula has significantly increased. Large-scale operations began on the 9th, and the German side has also acknowledged this fact. According to a London dispatch, although the U.S. military has cut across the Carentan-Cherbourg highway in several places, the German counterattacks remain extremely fierce. Eisenhower's headquarters also stated in its tenth battle report on the 10th: Fierce fighting is currently unfolding east of Cherbourg, and powerful German armored units have joined the battle. At the same time, the fighting from Caen to the mouth of the Vire River has also become fierce, and tank battles seem to have broken out south of Bayeux and around Caen. According to an Associated Press dispatch from London, the German 21st Tank Division has now been dispatched to the Caen area, and the German 12th Tank Division has also been dispatched to the Bayeux area. Near Tilly-sur-Seulles, southeast of Bayeux, the Allied forces have made contact with powerful German forces, causing the area around Bayeux to fall into chaos. The German fortresses remaining between the Allied bridgeheads continue to resist. It is reported that the Allied warships also fear injuring their own troops and have not been able to bombard them.</p>
<h3>Invading European Troops Establish Frontline Headquarters in France</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to reports from London, Montgomery has established a frontline headquarters at the bridgehead, and the headquarters of the US Ninth Air Force has also been moved to France.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - The German military authorities announced that the anti-Axis forces in northern France have received reinforcements in the past 24 hours and are currently expanding the bridgehead.</p>
<p>British and American Union Not Emphasized by Germany</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency reports: The British bridgehead between the mouths of the Ona and Vire rivers has been connected to the American bridgehead in the southeastern part of the Cotentin Peninsula. British troops have crossed the Vire Canal and made contact with American troops in Carentan and Sainte-Mère-Église. However, German authorities do not consider this union to be of any significant importance. The British troops in the Bayeux area and the American troops between Carentan and Montebourg have not been able to expand their bridgeheads in order to simultaneously launch strong offensives. Meanwhile, with the help of tanks, American troops are attempting to expand their bridgehead northward towards Cherbourg. At one point, they have reached the highway between Montebourg and Quinéville, but the American troops launching a westward assault from Sainte-Mère-Église have also been repelled.</p>
<p>Defense Forces' Strength Proven Formidable</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - A German military reporter reports: Since the anti-Axis forces landed, the fighting has only occurred in a coastal area of several hundred square kilometers for over a hundred hours. Moreover, this area has definitely not completely fallen into enemy hands. There are still several locations that serve as German bases and fortresses, where resistance is ongoing. In the area between the mouths of the Ona and Vire rivers, the depth of the anti-Axis bridgehead has increased by an average of ten kilometers in the past twelve hours. Furthermore, enemy troops crossed the Vire River, attempting to expand their bridgehead southwestward in order to establish contact with troops north of Carentan. In the past few hours, Eisenhower, suffering heavy losses on the left flank of the anti-Axis forces, has shifted his attention to the right flank. It is expected that the enemy will launch a new offensive to seize the Cotentin Peninsula. So far, looking at the overall situation in northern France, the following points are noteworthy: The strength of the German forces has proven to be ____. The German reserve forces have driven the enemy into ____ areas in several locations, while reserve forces in other locations are still awaiting orders. The strong enemy forces between the mouth of the Ona River and Dives have been defeated ____, and the strength of British and Canadian forces east of the Dives River to Le Havre has weakened, and they are currently trapped in a ____ state. Since the start of the operation, the enemy forces in Normandy have, in addition to several thousand captured, also lost 1,200 transport vehicles and 200 tanks, with the number of deaths exceeding the number of prisoners by several times.</p>
<p>German Military Strategy Lures Enemy Deep</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - The German authorities announced at noon on the 10th: The anti-Axis forces' landing operation in Europe will likely enter the second stage in the next few hours or days. The current operation is its initial phase. The anti-Axis forces have occupied a very wide and extensive coastline, and they have deployed new elite troops in these areas. However, judging from the current situation, the enemy forces are using all their strength just to maintain their acquired positions. In the next few days, the second stage of land battles will unfold. This landing operation will determine the outcome of the war. The German High Command advocates not preventing the anti-Axis forces from landing, luring the enemy in, and then completely annihilating them. The future goal of the anti-Axis landing is to cross the Vire River and advance northwest to establish contact with the anti-Axis forces near Sainte-Mère-Église and Carentan. Although the enemy has a wide landing area, it lacks major harbors. When the anti-Axis forces are about to establish contact, in order to occupy Cherbourg as a base of operations, they are attempting to cut off the Cotentin Peninsula. The German army has dispatched a large force in advance to counterattack. As far as the German army is concerned, the current battle is still in its initial stage. The German army is currently only participating in the bridgehead battle with the initial strategic reserve forces. Enemy ships are very active at sea from the Strait of Dover to Biscay. It is expected that this may be a feint operation for a new landing operation. In short, the German army has not yet begun the formal offensive that Eisenhower hoped for.</p>
<p>One Landing Ship Sunk</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - German naval fast attack craft are now launching night attacks on anti-Axis landing fleets and convoys, disrupting the enemy's landing operations. According to the German military authorities, from the evening of the 9th to the morning of the 10th, German fast attack craft broke into the central waters of the Seine Bay from the north, launching torpedoes and hitting an enemy ship of 5,000 tons, which immediately exploded and sank. Two other ships of 2,000 tons were also sunk by torpedoes. The sunk 5,000-ton ship was formerly a ferry in the English Channel and was converted into a small landing craft carrier before this landing operation. However, the number of small boats it carried is not yet detailed. Judging by its size, it could carry at least 20 landing craft (each carrying 96 people).</p>
<h3>French Labor Minister Encourages Nationals</h3>
<p>Paris, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - French Labor Minister, Mr. D, delivered a speech in Paris on the 10th, earnestly hoping that the French people would rise up together when the anti-Axis forces landed in northern France. His main point was that the battle currently unfolding in Normandy represents a great struggle between the world of totalitarianism and the world of social justice. I believe that the German army will be victorious in this battle, and at the same time, I have the same conviction about the revival of France. In fact, the time to decide the fate of France has now arrived, and the French people must abandon their bystander mentality and actively contribute to this unprecedented great struggle.</p>
<p>Attempted Assassination of Italian Crown Prince Fails</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency reports from Rome: An assassination attempt on Italian Crown Prince Umberto failed. The assailant fired several shots and immediately fled.</p>
<p>Suzhou Provincial Capital Middle School Speech Contest</p>
<p>Suzhou, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Jiangsu Branch of the East Asia League China General Association held a provincial capital middle school East Asia League ideology speech contest at the Qingxiang Memorial Hall at 2:00 PM yesterday.

<h3>Rice Shops Will Implement Free Trading of Rice; Actively Working to Handle Affairs</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of stabilizing the city's food supply, the authorities are adopting effective measures in all aspects to encourage purchasing merchants, rice shops, and farmers to transport rice to Shanghai as much as possible, and to severely punish illegal merchants for hoarding and speculation, and to crack down on extortion along the way. Since the municipal government announced on June 2 that before the "Measures for the Management of Rice Grain Entry into This City" is promulgated, purchasing merchants and nearby farmers who transport rice grain to Shanghai will be exempt from obtaining passports and certificates, and will be free to enter various entry points in the city, and the quantity will not be restricted. After the announcement, the amount of rice transported to Shanghai in recent days has not been small, and it is entirely used for civilian food. All rice shops in the city have also made considerable preparations. In addition to the rice shops in Nanshi, Zhabei, and West districts that are already trading freely, over a hundred rice shops engaged in rationed rice in the First District sent representatives to visit the First District Public Office authorities yesterday to explain the situation and request instructions. It is reported that the industry has obtained the permission of the authorities, and before the promulgation of the "Measures for the Management of Rice Grain Entry," they are allowed to participate in free trading, and will report the daily trading of rice to the competent authorities for reference. The rice shops in the district are actively engaged in purchasing and importing goods, busy with preparations, and will be able to meet the market soon.</p>
<p>Household Flour Rations Will Be Increased</p>
<p>Recently, the source of rice in the city has been insufficient, and prices have risen sharply. The municipal government authorities are paying close attention and are actively working to remedy the situation to help the people of Jiangsu overcome their difficulties. The Grain Bureau of Zhabei and the Economic Department of the First District have been in contact with the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee and other relevant parties for several days to prepare to increase the household flour rations by one time compared to the previous example, so that the city's food supply can be slightly conserved. The total monthly ration of household flour in the city has been about 220,000 bags. It is now planned to increase it to 440,000 bags per month. The collection of raw materials and the manufacture of flour are being actively planned. However, due to procedural matters, the household flour distributed in early June will still be allocated according to the original allocation of one jin of first-class flour per person. However, it is planned to increase the allocation of corn flour by half a jin, requiring an additional 40,000 bags. It will be generally sold from the 13th of this month with Comprehensive Ration Certificate No. 3. It is hoped that the doubled allocation of household flour can be realized from mid- or late-June. It is also reported that the authorities are determined to find ways to fully allocate the three installments of household flour this month.</p>
<h3>Oriental Culture Translation Institute Held Establishment Meeting Yesterday; Translation Work Begins Immediately</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association, in order to study new developments in Oriental culture and promote communication between Chinese and Japanese cultures, has recently hired well-known figures from the Chinese and Japanese cultural circles in Shanghai to organize the Oriental Culture Translation Institute to engage in publishing. The institute held its first board meeting yesterday (the 11th) afternoon. Those present included Secretary Nakata, Fumio Ozake, Hirokichi Hayashi, Toyusuke Yoshida, Zhengping Zhao, Quanshi Li, Hufan Wu, and Binhe Chen, totaling more than ten people. The meeting was first addressed by the chairman, Mr. Binhe Chen, who gave an opening speech and explained the significance of the establishment. The selection of the board members and the work plan were then approved, and the meeting adjourned in the evening. It is reported that the institute is located in the China-Japan Cultural Association on Xianyang Road, and the translation work will begin immediately.</p>
<h3>Recent Rice and Grain Exports from Songjiang County</h3>
<p>After finishing his investigation of rice and grain conditions in the Kunshan area, the Continental News reporter, Mr. Takemoto, went to Songjiang, the distribution center for "Songjiang rice." He visited the rice control committee office, the rice industry trade association, Japanese trading companies, the preparatory committee of the Chinese purchasing trade association, the county government, the county cooperative, and other related agencies to investigate the rice and grain problem in Songjiang and the problem of shipping rice to Shanghai. The rice and grain issue is also the most important issue in the area, and the relevant authorities find it quite difficult to handle and deeply feel the need to quickly establish a unified central and local policy. Songjiang has long been the most prosperous area for transportation by rail, road, and waterway, and it is also the area most deeply affected by the new rice and grain measures. Future rice and grain countermeasures should not only start from Shanghai's perspective, but must be based on Songjiang, Kunshan, and other rice-producing areas surrounding Shanghai and promote a comprehensive and planned approach. Sacrificing Songjiang's livelihood for Shanghai's people's livelihood, or sacrificing Shanghai's people's livelihood for Songjiang's people's livelihood, is not desirable. It is hoped that a new policy for rice and grain purchase and allocation that includes all producing areas and all consuming areas will be implemented. The above requirements are by no means abstract, but arise from the concrete realities encountered by the Songjiang County government. Therefore, how the National Government and the Rice Control Committee handle this request is noteworthy. The rice and grain problems encountered by the Songjiang County government are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>County Government's Countermeasures</p>
<p>Songjiang rice and grain market prices began to rise sharply on April 29. By the first ten days of May, they had risen by 90%. After that, the rising trend slowed down slightly. Since June 3, they have gradually declined. This is less due to the impact of the decline in Shanghai's rice and grain market prices than to the result of the Songjiang County government's emergency measures to suppress rice prices on June 3. From April 29 to June 2, the amount of rice and grain shipped from Songjiang or through Songjiang rice merchants to Shanghai is estimated to be about 100,000 shi. Because thousands of shi of rice and grain are being transported by rail, road, and waterway, the trend of transporting Songjiang rice and grain to Shanghai continues. If this continues, it may cause a major obstacle to ensuring the food supply for the people of Songjiang. The county government, together with various relevant agencies, researched preventive measures. The content of the countermeasures is:</p>
<p>1. Suppress Songjiang rice and grain to a maximum of 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>2. Prohibit the removal of more than 〇 kilograms of rice and grain.</p>
<p>After the announcement was issued on June 3, the rice shops were forced to close down for several days. Later, after the rice industry trade association stated various reasons, especially the highest market price of 4,000 yuan, which was too low compared to Shanghai's market price, it appealed to the standing committee. As a result, it was decided that 5,500 yuan would be the county government's recognized highest market price, and the rice shops would be responsible for selling five catties of rice to residents of Songjiang city area with citizen's certificates each time. Of course, after the announcement, a considerable amount continued to be transported out. Although this is not the same as Shanghai's rationing system, it can at least be regarded as a temporary bud of a rationing system during the lean season, which is worthy of attention. The above facts illustrate that the problem of transportation to Shanghai should be based on a comprehensive plan that takes into account the reasonable relationship with the problem of transportation from various regions. It is hoped that the food policy for each major consumer area will be implemented with unified guidance. (翔: Translated from the Continental News of June 11)</p>
<p>Chen Binhe's Speech</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association, in view of the extreme necessity of promoting Oriental culture, has established and merged into one group, named the Oriental Culture Translation Institute, hoping that in the future, under the guidance of everyone, it will be able to carry out large-scale publication work in a planned and unified manner, so as to better achieve the purpose of cultural exchange between China and Japan.</p>
<p>Approved List of Personnel</p>
<p>The standing directors were then elected. The elected standing directors were Secretary Nakata, Fumio Ozake, Hirokichi Hayashi, and Toyusuke Kichijitsu from the Japanese side, and Binhe Chen, Zhengping Zhao, Hufan Wu, Quanshi Li, and Jingsun Tao from the Chinese side. Binhe Chen is the director and curator, and Fumio Ozake is the vice curator.</p>
<p>Work Plan</p>
<p>The institute's work plan is quite extensive. In addition to introducing famous figures in Japanese culture, there are also detailed translation plans for other books, such as famous works in social science, Chinese research series, and natural science series. The institute has now started translation, and the first book to be translated is "Wartime National Reader" by the famous figure in the Japanese cultural world, Mr. Sufu Tokutomi, which has been translated and will be published soon.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government to Ban Shipping Business Offices Today</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Huazhong Transportation Industry Shipping Business Office has privately collected fees, affecting the unified shipping industry. At a time when materials are urgently needed to be cleared, this is hindering transportation. After reporting to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, it was considered that the business office had not been approved in advance according to the law and had set up a fee-collecting office without authorization, which was inappropriate. Therefore, it ordered the subordinate first and second battalion general bureaus to ban it in order to maintain shipping and ____ merchants ____.</p>
<h3>Second Police Bureau Strengthens Special High Work</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen special high work, the Shanghai Second Police Bureau has adjusted the lineup of the special high section and appointed Chen Liang as the section chief. He has already taken office and ordered the special high personnel of the subordinate branch bureaus and district police bureaus to report separately from yesterday in order to strengthen the special high work.</p>
<h3>Electricity Saving Campaign Encourages Residents to Promote; Electricity Bills Have Increased This Month</h3>
<p>In order to make up for losses, the Shanghai Power Company has slightly increased the electricity bills for users from this month. The previous price of 2.81 yuan per kilowatt-hour has now increased to 4.31 yuan per kilowatt-hour, an increase of about 50 percent. At the same time, according to reporters' inquiries with the company, the electricity saving campaign encourages residents to save another 20 percent of electricity. Although it is not mandatory, it is hoped that citizens will understand the difficult times and strive to achieve this goal. As for those who exceed the initially set limit for more than two times, the company will now cut off their electricity. The decision on how long the electricity will be cut off will be based on how much the user exceeds the electricity limit.</p>
<h3>Health Exhibition Open All Day Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Summer Health Movement Conference officially opened on the first of the month, and a health exhibition was held at the racecourse. The exhibition was carefully planned and arranged by the Municipal Health Bureau, and major pharmaceutical factories and health food companies participated in the display. Specimens and wall charts were dazzling, and the publicity for summer and general health was very effective. Citizens who visited were extremely enthusiastic. It is reported that the exhibition will be extended to ensure that the general public can visit and gain health knowledge. It will be open all day from today (the 12th) for people to browse. It will end in mid-month.</p>
<h3>First Police Bureau to Issue Transportation Passports</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Police Bureau, in order to facilitate residents in the territory to transport coffins to various places outside the city, previously reported to the municipal government for approval to issue coffin transportation passports in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations for the Issuance of Coffin Transportation Passports in Shanghai Special Municipality." The relevant information has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the bureau has completed all the preparatory procedures, and it is specifically stipulated that the issuance of this passport will begin on the 15th of this month (June). A license fee of ten yuan will be charged for each coffin, and a stamp fee of two yuan will be charged for each license. Those who live in the territory of the bureau and want to transport coffins to other places can apply to the Security Administration Section of the Administrative Office of the bureau at that time.</p>

Xiqing is composed of the essence of the giant Monok and the Sanma teams. Good players such as Kaitiemiilov, Taobulinji, Yelong, Botuo, Shasijin, and Ochailiao are all brave and good at fighting, especially with abundant physical strength. The two armies have their own merits in ball skills and similar strengths. A hearty battle at the time of their meeting will be a matter of course. The battle will be a three-game, two-win system. The first battle is tonight, the second act is scheduled for the 14th (Wednesday), and the final act is on the 16th (Friday). Each game will sell 800 tickets. Presales will begin in the morning at the newspaper office on Hankou Road, and sales will begin at Zhongqing from 5:00 PM. Don't miss the opportunity because of the lack of seats.

<h3>Confucius Cup Football Match; Donghua vs. Qiaolian</h3>
<p>The Confucius Cup charity football match between Donghua and Qiaolian, organized by the Shandong Provincial Association, will start at 5:30 this afternoon at the Yiyuan Stadium on Chengyang Road. Tickets are sold for 100 yuan, 200 yuan, and 500 yuan. Since the beginning of this season, Donghua's strong style has been unparalleled. Qiaolian is known for its fierceness, and has the help of four knights from Tianjin, Bonini, Tai Erzika, Jiang Xuedou, and Yayi Tuomali, which has greatly increased its strength. At the time, there will be a fierce battle. Football auctions will be purchased in the name of the seventy-two disciples of Confucius, which can be described as unique. The lineup is recorded below:</p>
<p>Donghua: Zhang Banglun, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Fu Zhen, Zhang Lingen, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang.</p>
<p>Qiaolian: Tai Ershika, Luo Xulai, Jiang Xuedou, Bolini, Xilati, Xueweitai, Bama, Yatuomali, Autonilo, Bao Jie, Taiguni.</p>
<p>The city's price trends are still quite stable under the strict supervision of the competent authorities. However, due to the frequent rise in black market rice prices, some of the important foods used to fill the stomach, such as noodles, cooked foods, miscellaneous grains, and cooking oil, have been slightly affected, resulting in inconsistent selling prices. In addition, in the past half month, agricultural products from various places have been transported to Shanghai quite frequently along the way. However, they are all generally carried on the shoulders of scattered small vendors. Although the number of each shipment is not as large as ideal, the number of vendors is numerous, and it is estimated that the agricultural products transported to Shanghai in half a month are quite considerable, so it is very helpful to the supply of spot goods in the city.</p>
