<h3>拙著日文版「日本的反省與中國的革新」序</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>僑居中國的很多日本人，因目睹和耳聞亞洲民族之生活裹。假設這種道義性，只在日本國民坐活裹，表現為新體制，而在盟邦中國的人民生活中，舊體制依然如故，則希望兩國人民，一心一德，駢肩作戰，以求大東亞戰爭的勝利，是等於緣木求魚。中國的事，在日本方面看，業已不能認為是他國漠不相關的事，正如日本的事，對於中國說，也不是他國的事一樣。</p>
<p>「中國自中國，日本自日本」這句話，固然是具有強烈獨善主義傾向的日本人，應當細加玩味的話，然而淺言之，則十足充滿着狹隘民族主養的氣氛。按現狀來說，似乎認為中國民衆的生活問題，是中國內部的問題，而與日本無涉，這之合乎新政策的宗旨，因而日本只專心於日本的戰時體制，只專心於「一億同胞的一致團結」。自然，今日的戰爭，是非國家總力動員不可；然而大東亞戰爭，單純日本總力動員，是絕對不能成功的。大東亞戰爭，當所有亞洲民族全體總力參加時，方能成功。假如有否認這個意見的人，那就是把大東亞戰爭看得太容易了。美國擁有南北美的附庸國家，英國具有海外許多領地，重慶佔有中國大半的土地，各自全都動員所有物資與人力對付日本，而日本竟敢以獨力奮勇抗戰者，是以超越普通戰爭科學的精神力為後盾的原故。這種精神後盾，就是此次戰爭的道義性格。日本如起而為亞洲獨立而戰，朋共他亞洲民族也就起而為亞洲獨立而戰－－如無此種確信，而認為此次戰爭能勝利的人，恐怕這個人的思老能力，就大成問題。</p>
<p>近四五年來，日本對於英美式思想方法，不斷發生了許多批制。於是反對英美式思老方法，，而反動地建立起來東方式思老方法，即反對「論理方法」，而錯誤地建立起來「直覺方法」。東方式的思索方法，因為是重視體騐的，且其表現形式又是象徵的，所以人們便不知不覺染上輕視思考原理的論理習慣。但，沒有論理是不能思老的。所謂直覺，是思老按論理發展，而達到極度時所發生的思考跳躍。思老在論理階段上跳躍，而立於一個階段高處時的知覺，這便是直覺。如站在這個立塲上，就會認為前此經過的論覺。所以直覺，並不否定論理，而是論理的然而日本說，將來的人類認為「胆」比腦重要，為了造成胆力，則需要丹田用力，而實行準備行動的生理思　法（？）。「胆」是由於各種論理思　和追求的結果，而感覺到業已別無他途，非如此不可所決定者。所謂「大胆作去」，就是由於平常對於自己局圍能夠發生的一切可能事象，加以論理思索的結果，縱有意外事件發生，也會發現能直覺應付的方法。平常並不絞腦榨汁，實行論理思索，而竟輕易達到「自信」者，就是把「錯覺」誤認作「直覺」的人。這種人，或許富於行動，然而他們的行動，卻像「唐吉訶德」衝向風車一樣。</p>
<p>我堅決相信，日本是由於各種理論思索的結果，而別無他途只好大胆發動大東亞戰爭。大果亞戰爭的形勢，無論怎樣嚴重和吃緊，而對於認為別無他途只有出此的人來說，是不會發生動搖的。假定日本人對於戰爭前途信念，稍有動搖，這是他們不澈底追求論理思索，而妄自滿足於「自信」的「錯覺」所致。那未不得不使日本發動大東亞戰爭者，究竟是什麽？關於這一點，我們對於世界大戰前夕的各國形勢，稍加具體說明一下</p>
<p>一九一七年協約國向美國銀行家所借的款項，竟達十五萬萬金元之多。當時協約國方面的形勢並不好，假如協約國屈服於德國，自然美國的貸款就不會再回到美國銀行家手裹了。這將是美國銀行家的危機，尤其是摩爾根財閥的危機，同時也是美國金融資本家的共同危機。由於第一次歐戰，而突飛猛進了的美國造船業，機械工業，軍需工業，以及其他產業，美國人決不希望戰爭短期結束，致使他們的發財景氣，陷於萬丈深淵。所以他們以摩爾根財閥為先鋒，而對威爾　大總統要求美國參戰。這就是美國爭取世界領導權的開端。結果，當時戰爭因德國一敗塗地而宣吿結束時，他們所遭受到的困難，反比戰時更加嚴重。問題即在於戰時發展了的美國生產機構，究竟怎樣維持這一點上。美國的金融資本家，解決這一問題，是採用一九二四年道斯計畫的方法。例如：美國把資本一部貸與德國，而強制德國購買美國的商品，就是說，製造「人工」購買力：企圖維持美國的繁榮。美國也會如法泡製，把此方法施行於其他歐洲各國，因此戰後的美國資本主義，會一時得天獨厚，受到高度的繁榮。於是美國認為資本主義可以永久繁榮，所以便命名為「萬世景氣」。然而美國的「萬世景氣」，自然是有一定限度的，這一點，凡是有常識者，老早就曾知道。換言之，只要世界各國不得不買美國商品的世界機構－－美國金融資本支配下的世界機構－－存在一天，這就會繁榮一天。這種世界機構，實際上不過存在了五年，迄至一九二九年。當時藉美國放款資木，而復興起來的德國及共他歐洲資本主義，便提高了空前龐天的生產力。這類國家，不僅無須再買美國的商品，同時本國的生產物，又不能不向世界各地輸出。於是必然所發生者，就是全世界的生產過剩。因此美國的「萬世景氣」，突然宣吿壽終正寢，然而代之以興者，卻是全世界的不景氣現象。過一不景氣時代，雖說直至一九三三年，會繼續了四年的毀減性打擊，然而其後數年間，也未會恢復正式的景氣。當時全世界的失業者總數，號稱三千萬至五千萬人，即單就美國一國論，失業者也竟達七八百萬之多。</p>
<p>應付這一失業的問題，以及美國資本主義怎樣重新支配世界的問題，這就是美國金融資本家課與華盛頓政府的第二個命題。羅斯福的新政策，就是為解決這種問題，應運而生者。新政策的主旨如下。。一，絕對保持美國工人的高度生活水平（這一點，使「工人貴族」擁護美國政府的外交政策，以及維持美國的內部市塲，是必要的。）二，以國家津貼制度保證多至七百萬失業者的生活（這在維持動搖中的金融資本家之政治領導權上，是必要的。）三，為實施上述兩大政策計，創立龐大的國家消費事業，而所需的巨大經費，則由赤字公債補充。</p>
<p>這就是說，政府藉「榨富濟貧」政策，一方面取得工人的支持，而另一方面，政府經常用巨額國家頂算來揮霍金錢，以保障資本家的利益。美國籍這種無限地揮霍金錢政策，而金圖挽狂瀾於既倒，以維持人工繁榮。當然，為了維持美國巨大的生產力，則必須建立巨大的消費事業。而戰爭，就是最需要物資的消費事業，且對於全世界最雄厚的美國生產力來說，自然，世界大戰就是唯一規模最大的消費事業。因此，美國以外的世界各國，山於美國金融資本有上述必然的要求，而就碰到兩種危險。第一個危險，就是完全屈服於美國金融資木家的面前，凡與美國生產品競爭的生產品，都要停止製造，不管願意不願意，都要輸入美國的商品，且必須按他們的要求，而輸出原料。這就是說，不外完全化為美國金融資木的奴隸道路。進一點最明顯的典型，可以說是「獨立自由」的民主國墨西哥。暫舉一具有興味的實例，來說明該國。（以下轉入第四版）</p>

<h3>粵糖類等六項　准予恢復出口</h3>

<h3>日軍猛攻巴列爾　敵開始全面退却　伊姆法爾亦臨陷落階段</h3>
<p>仰光二十九日中央社電　伊姆法爾盆地隘路口耍衝巴列爾敵軍，連日遭日印盟軍之猛攻不支，巳開始全面退却，巴列爾公路陣地寨巴姆。謝那姆等區二綫要寨綫業已喪失，巴列爾敵軍第二十三師主力約一萬二在人之衆，恐受日軍包圍，乃於二十五日黃昏及二十六日黎關放棄其死守巴列爾之計劃，只以對四五六二高地作最後防戰線，在第一線陣地格爾嘉留少數兵力，圖阻日印同盟軍之猛攻。巴列爾之敵第二十飾主力即於二十六日開始向巴列爾北方二十公里伊姆法爾東南二十五公里之瓦基方面撤退。日方某兵團主力戰　部隊對崩潰之敵軍，已目達姆巴列爾公路之綫及雅庫馬河谷向巴列爾之殘敵猛攻，現正以全力展開肉搏攻擊。其中一部巳突入巴列爾北方七公里之庫奴達，另有強力精銳一部突破殘存敵陣，頃正向距雕伊姆法爾最近之某地繼續進擊，敵已陷於混亂。</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　據印度前綫電，團攻伊姆法爾之日軍，自開始總攻以來，今已逐步迫近敵陣之核心，同時，近　挺進隊已將伊姆法爾西北方二十大貯水池炸毀，敵軍大為恐慌。又於盆地要塞中，最富于抵抗力之東　路口巴列爾要塞，因日軍數次猛攻，已於二十六日放棄王要陣地，開始總退却。盆地西南要衝比先波爾方面之戰況，日軍亦有迅速進展。日軍于此二旬內，對伊姆法爾附近各要塞之攻略戰，于遂漸進展之同時，更因航空部　之協力，對敵空中補給之戰們奏效莫大，伊姆法爾之陷落，已臨于最後之階段矣。</p>

<h3>甘地康復</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　孟買來電：孟買省政府昨日發表：甘地翁自日前發熱後，最近已回復健康。</p>
<h3>美海軍部長　諾克斯逝世　部務由次長代理</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：華盛頓官方宣稱，美國海軍部長諾克斯昨日突然逝世，享年七十負，其繼任人選以次長佛爾列斯特（年四十八）為最有希望，但威爾基亦被提及，在羅斯福總統正式委任新海長前，佛氏將繼續代理部務。</p>
<h3>德國積極準備　就會未來戰局　比斯開灣防備鞏固</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：東綫雙方加強其突擊活動，而在西面英美軍計劃中之進攻前錢之各點，亦有加緊之德軍活動，此為現行戰局之形勢。</p>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德工兵一分隊於八天之內，在比斯開灣（Ｂay　of　Ｂiscay）區內築成畏及二十公里之深大障碍陣地一處，在此短促之時期內，　工兵已埋下各種地雷二十萬枚以上，並已築成各種　絲網障碍物，長及一百公里以上，因而該區已成為人與坦克車之陷阱。</p>
<p>攻巴爾幹迫在眉睫</p>
<p>沮利克二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：此間消息靈通方面訊，反軸心軍進攻巴爾幹已迫在眉睫，據息英美大軍集中於近東，反軸心國地中海艦隊現來往於希臘海岸外甚為頻繁，此問認反軸心軍　攻巴爾幹，為援助南斯拉夫境內蒂托將軍部下之游擊隊。</p>
<h3>日本戰力雄厚　確信必能獲勝　松島部長在京演講</h3>
<p>（續昨）為突破日本內南洋羣島之防禦鐵環，敵曾屢遭損害，最近敵似模倣德攻波蘭之故步，有出動大量飛機，往前錢助戰之企圖。</p>
<p>前曾言及敵之戰略目標，在以此島為赴中國大陸之橋樑，故彼力岡阻撓日軍戰力之充實，無論何處凡有資源之所在，皆設有實兵。同時與此戰略相並行，在日本內綫，則派有五十艘以上之潛水艇，施行海上交通　斷作戰。由於日方堅強之防備，敵人企圖　終未得展。</p>
<p>日軍先發制人</p>
<p>日陸軍於印緬方面所以　之戰果，予敵軍以一極之打擊，不僅對來特公路之建設，加以阻碍，並使反軸心東南亞聯合軍司令部，因此遷往鍚蘭島山中，今後敵或將由印度洋方面給日軍以側背之攻擊，此言若果實在，則須知今日不僅氣候條件不適合，即必要之大量艦隊，於第二戰綫結成前，想亦決非可能。日前敵會對蘇門答臘一角之　班島，舉行空襲，然此僅為偵察戰與牽制戰而已，敵方正宣傳將以英美荷澳，以及義大利之殘敗艦隊聯合起來，參加此次作戰云云。</p>
<p>慣於作　　宜傳之敵人，此次臨時拉夫之手段，實極為拙劣，不值一笑。「蜀中無大將，廖化作先鋒，」義大利巴特里奧政權，竟亦為彼等拉出作戰，殊堪憐憫。彼等以僅有之力量，竟不能為祖國而作戰，至堪浩嘆。其次中國大陸方面，敵人空軍之活動，亦須加以注意。今日日陸海空軍，常以先發制人之態勢，給予敵人以痛烈之打擊。自印度越過喜馬拉雅山境之日軍，切斷敵人補給路綫，現該方戰事，正逐漸有利展開中。敵人最後之目標，當為日本本土之空襲，及南方交通之阻害，然日本對跋扈之敵，即將由日軍之手，一一予以置諸死地，此全不成問題。同時民間方面，努力鞏固防空陣營，對敵機來襲，亦可吿無虞，目前在各地進行之防空任務國甚積極也。英美軍企圖在渝方，集中陸海空軍之威力對付日本，常此大東亞戰爭步入最後階段之時，吾人抱必勝之信念，以　決勝戰果，對於英美奢望制壓中國大陸之野心。自當澈底予以擊滅</p>
<p>爭取最後勝利</p>
<p>美軍事評論家卡加那陸軍中佐，會就美國之攻勢作戰，加以闡明如次：</p>
<p>「美國當滿洲事變之際，即應進攻中國，如是則中國為保護滿洲領土起見，必舉全力在中國及東亞各處，建設飛機工場及軍用飛行場，作為中國大陸基地，以實現積蓄戰略上所需之原料資材，故結果，美國至少有三十萬軍隊駐屯中國」</p>
<p>由此可知美國本意之所在，與今日日本之公正協力，實有天壤之夙，故渝方極應加以深刻之考慮。今日日本之作戰，，以爭取大東亞最後勝利，與防止英美對中國之侵略，使中國之國土及人民，免於戰禍為其根本觀念，此亦即為大東亞宣言之理念也</p>
<p>另一方面歐局情勢，英美第二戰綫之結成，已為最重點，故一般之推測，皆以五月間英美或將對此作一當試。吾人對德人忍不拔之精神，極表敬意，主於敵方第二戰綫之結成，而顯示出德人之真正實力，以為建設新歐洲事業，展開一大光明。</p>
<p>與歐洲戰爭併行之大東亞戰爭，刻已逐漸進入重大階段，以中日之全力，擊　頑敵之攻擊，或可與歐洲同時東西完成其擊滅英美之偉業。</p>
<p>日本之必勝態勢，已日形鞏固，今後將愈形發揮戰略之妙用，但在妙用之發揮上，尚須有物質精神，兩方面極大之力量，此即後方國民之必勝信念，與必信行動。所謂經濟戰與思想戰，為目前後方呼應前綫將兵之唯一途徑。東亞三千年光榮歷史之持續，與大東亞之光榮建設，此兩重責任，皆負於吾等之雙肩，深望值此決戰之秋，以死奉公之決心，爭取勝利。（完）</p>
<h3>德國對巴爾幹　閃電措置成功</h3>
<p>東部戰綫的重心，由烏克關向巴爾幹移動。契柯大元帥部下的蘇聯第一烏克蘭戰綫軍，擬經齊爾諾維區突破喀爾巴阡山脈；果納夫元帥部下第二烏克蘭戰綫軍，以耶斯伊為目標，使入羅馬尼亞；瑪利諾夫司基軍大將部下第三烏克蘭戰綫軍，誣尼哥拉愛夫向奧迪薩隆前進中，紅軍今後之戰略地點，第一，從羅馬尼亞向西南方進軍，達多瑙河後，企　席卷多瑙河平原；第二，傾其主力攻擊中部並南部波蘭。總之，紅軍如力之所及，將繼續所有攻勢派以分散德軍防線。</p>
<p>強化東南歐要塞</p>
<p>遭遇巴爾幹危機之德國，早已進駐洪治牙利，同時，並確求保持羅馬尼亞，保加利亞安之對策，傾其全力以強化東南歐要塞第一線。這機總　　方聲明是為了一該上巴爾幹的巴陀里奧的緣哉。到現在為止，德國的這閃電對策，已獲成功，英美所希望的攪亂內部政治，已無形防止了。</p>
<p>在洪牙利，以前駐德公使史托耶氏為領袖的新內閣，代加萊內閣而起，以箭十字黨伊姆萊第一派為背景，暗中進行　清國內。參謀總長庫點泰式入閱為陸軍部長，蹬明洪牙利軍部之對德協力，無所變更。</p>
<p>至於羅馬尼亞，在三年的對蘇戰爭中，已經犧牲了數十萬生命。現因處於蘇聯的威脅下，故如安托納斯哥將軍等該國指導者，並不考慮和平問題，且因勃洛愛斯齊油田的關係，對羅馬尼亞國內的治安，特別加以警戒。萬一蘇聯軍今後如更深入羅國境內，而現下放不足統制國內時，則鐵　團即將出面維持。英美破致期　的農民黨首領馬尼島，義勇黨首領地努格拉却泰努兩氏，目前並無政治的實力，毫無活動反政府的餘地。</p>
<p>保國內政上的危機</p>
<p>現在保國政府的指導勢力，是鮑利斯國五賀崩後，由契利爾公爵，前首相費洛夫氏等所組織的攝政政府。因為同是斯拉夫民族，所以蘇聯的影響力頗深入民間，故而對蘇聯戰事亦未參加。蘇聯亦在暗中極力策動國內親蘇派活躍，並令前第三國際書記長蓋契羅基，特米德洛夫氏（保國人）潛入。德國特別重視保加利亞，而不稍怠於警戒者，即以此故。</p>
<p>總之，上述東南歐要塞第一線的巴爾幹三國，衹要稍有弱化的現象，就威脅德國的生命線，因而先前所取強化三國治安的　置，頗為適時。德軍以喀爾巴阡山脈的天險為背景，在加拉茲，耶斯伊，齊諾維區，倫倍爾格之線上，如能阻止蘇聯軍的進攻，則東南歐要塞，在政治上更可安定。（翔譯自四月九日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>昨盟邦天長節　日僑熱烈慶祝　並舉行盛大戲機命名典禮</h3>
<p>昨日為大東亞戰爭以來盟邦日本第三屆天長佳節，本市日僑各界均懸旗誌慶。上午入時五十分，興亞報國會假虹口公園舉行盛大慶祝儀式。本市日僑陸續赴會，至時齊向更方　祝聖壽萬歲，　室彌榮。繼唱國歌，後由矢野總領事恭　大認，矢野報國會畏朗讀　祝詞，最後全體合唱天畏節奉祝歌，並由安井民會議長領導三呼萬歲，而盛大之祝賀典禮於焉吿終。</p>

<h3>中日文協　舉行醫學演講　邀醫學會日代表主講</h3>
<p>本市中日文化協會，以此次第三屆醫學大會各國出席會員代表，齊集滬上，機會難逢，本文化交流之使命，特於昨（二十九）日上午十時，假座蘭心大戲院，商請此次日本出席代表林春雄氏作特訓講演，到有國立上海醫學院，聖約翰大學醫學院，同德醫學院，東南醫學院，震且大學，上海中醫學院，新中國醫學院等學生千餘人，苜由該會　化人致詞介紹，繼由林春雄講演，題目為醫學之新　徑」，祥述醫學之目的，在謀人類之健康，以國家民族社會為對象，不是單以醫治少數人疾病為對象，幷非狹義的健康，而是廣義的健康，繼謂為國家族健康的醫學，應注重整個國家如何防止疾病及傳染病之蔓延，末談及東亞人口問題，由人口生產率而言，及大東亞各民族之未來新希望，反視英美諸國在公共衛生設備相當良好環境下人口反而日漸減少，這是業微一個國家日趨末洛云云。旋即由武山藥廠獻映醫學影片為「腦腫瘍」及「醫學日本」，內容精彩，直至十二時始散。頃悉該會定於今日上午十時總續商請宮川米次講演，題為「醫療與民族的特殊性」並由武田藥廠獻映　對精神病者之自實切載符，　冒及十二指腸潰瘍之　線診斷，　製藥。</p>
<h3>醫學大會圓滿結束　各國代表發表感想</h3>
<p>確保東亞十億民族健康及策進大東亞醫學之第三屆東亞醫學大會，已於前日圓滿結東，中央社記者特於昨（廿九）日分訪大會會長褚民誼氏，副會長陸　之，以及各國出席代表，承發表感想如次：</p>
<p>褚會長民誼</p>
<p>目下東亞各國為正義</p>
<p>而戰爭，時處於一切物力人力不足的時期，能夠得　這樣一個盛大有意義的團際問的學術會議，集大東亞各國學者於一堂，共同研磋，共同發表新的學職，新的見解，實是一件極可重視也是極可欣幸的事，幷且由此可見東亞各國的同民協力，朝野一心的精神，並不是空　的，東亞的將來是光明的，更是使人惑到必須慶賀的一件事。回憶東亞醫學會，第一次大會時只有中日滿越四國，以後逐次擴張，本次大會增加到中日滿泰緬菲越七國，除了印度因正在為　國自由滬鬥中，所以不能參加以外，我相信本會的將來，定能有偉大的供獻。</p>
<p>陸副會長潤之</p>
<p>今日東亞醫學會第三屆大會已經圓滿閉幕，本人以全關衛生行政長官的資格，對這次大會的情形感想，略為發表一些拙見。東亞醫學會的歷史只有短短的三年，但是這三年中的發展確是驚人，以參加的單位國家來說，三年中已包括了全東亞各獨立國，以演題的內容來說，每年發表的新學說新技術，日見增加，內容日見充實，以會員的人數來說初發起時不過百餘人，現在已增到千人以上，以上諸點，足以證明東亞各國學者間的熱誠，這種現象不但是可以欣賞，也是令我們全體興奮的一件事。我國的醫學水準街生常識，向來是落後的，這一次東亞醫學會在我國舉行，至少對於現在的中國民衆，給與了一種淸晰的認識。</p>
<p>日代表林春雄</p>
<p>此次第三屆東亞醫學會在中國舉行，第一日於南京中日文化協會召開大會，繼於二十六。七。八三日在上海震旦大學舉行演講會，出席者有中國方面，褚民誼會長以下多數醫學者，暨衡生行政人員，日本國方面亦出席數十名，滿洲國十餘名，此外尚有越南代表，緬甸代表（泰國代表因氣候關係尚未抵達）共計不下二百餘名，盛況空前。特別講演共八題。普通講演共一百餘題，無不為各學者經多年調查研究之心得，於學　上殊多貢獻。此次大會有一點特色，別關於去年在東京舉行第二屆更亞醫學會時所指定之六個研究間題，各關分別設立委員曾，均能提出調查　究之結果，就各問題分別以圓東會議形式。召開小組委員會交換意見，共同切磋，期於明年再繼續討論。至於此次會議情形，業於二十八日會塲上報吿，研究問題包括結核，癩病。　疾。以及急性傳染病，均係戰時下最感適切之問題。</p>
<p>菲列賓代表</p>
<p>此次第三屆東亞醫學大會已順利結束，余等蒙中國國民政府之邀幸得參興，茲特代表菲列賓共和國表示吾人極深切之謝意。吾人現今返國，對於貴國及其民衆實懷有美麗而不可磨減之印象，而對於有歷史性之南京及商業鉅港之上海，印象尤深，而對於貴國高級官吏協助此次大會之完成，尤深感動，吾人希望在不久之將來，菲列實亦得為東道主，俾有機會以酬貴國之厚意</p>
<p>越南代表雷那</p>
<p>敝人這次代表越南的醫藥學界，出席參加這次的盛會，僅拿他們近年來一點工作成續的報吿，來獻給大會，希望友邦專家們給予指正。我覺得在現在的時期，世界上每一個角落都遭受着同樣的處境，公共衛生及保健的實施，都成為目今最重要的問題，東亞諸盟邦的當局鑒於他的需要性，在最近三年來，每年舉行醫學大一會一次，互相交換醫學新的知識，以保人類的健康可以說是一個最賢明及極有效的方策。</p>
<p>拜耳藥廠歡宴　東醫大會代表</p>
<p>本埠拜耳藥廠於日前第三屆東亞醫學大會開幕日，假座都城飯店，設宴款待該會全體代表，到二百餘人，出席者有國府外交部長本屆大會主席禇民誼博士，衛生署長陸瀾之，及東亞醫學會會長與中，日，滿，泰，緬，菲，各地會員，暨本埠德國醫學院德醫公會等代表，歡敘一堂，由拜耳全亞代表員靈氏，拜耳中滿總經理斐宣德氏，先後致辭歡迎，最後由拜耳科學研究部主任委員威爾邦博士，陳述拜耳藥廠在現行戰爭時期內，維護東亞民眾健康方面所盡之貢獻，及在全球各地，維　德國醫藥事來之　　，餐後盡歡而散</p>
<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3>上海股票問題</h3>
<p>今日街談巷議中的上海股票問題，不是「股票為什麽仍舊好不起來」，便是「股票到底何時可以看漲」，倘然以這兩句話為討論上海股票問題的範圍，那未免小視華商股票的前途了。</p>
<p>關於上海股票問題，小倉最高經濟顧問日前答記者問時曾說：「發行股票原為發展工商企業之動機，切不可利用為投機對象，此影饗金融事業甚鉅，今後對於有投機行為者應予糾正，務使趨入正常交易」。寥寥數語，對於股票發行之意義，股票投機之危險，以及股票交易應行遵循之途徑，實覺言簡而意賅。</p>
<p>股票交易如何能正常化，使其有助於生產而不流人投機，自為一般經濟界有識之士所最關懷的一個問題。我們覺得解決　個問題的關鍵，以目前整個證券市場始終停滯於沉悶不景氣的狀態中而言，似乎有兩　應當採取的：其一，政府方面採用各種有効方法，維持華商股票的合理價格，甚至仿照日本的股票價格統制辦法；其二，企業界與證券界刻意依照平衛的計劃戰行證券，甚　設法收回一部份過於汎濫的證券流通　碼。如此，我們相信證券市場，必可逐漸趨於穩定，同時，產　資金亦可免於浮雲流水的狀態，自然州逐漸有助於農工的生產。這使是我們所認為上海股票問題的關鍵。</p>
<h3>顧寶衛在滬財產　地檢署奉令扣押</h3>
<p>前糧食部長顧寶衡，因利用職權營私舞弊，經國府明令撤職查　在案，山特別法庭依法嚴詞中。茲據中央社記者探悉，本市地方檢察署，刻奉特別法庭命令，將顧在滬不動產等房屋，先予扣押，是以該署檢察長沈文傑氏，特派檢察官吳麗冬趙振玉兩氏，於日前起，予以正式執行扣押。</p>
<h3>張司法部長　昨日抵滬</h3>
<p>國府司法行政部長張一鵬氏，因公來滬，於昨日（二十九日）午後二時半，安抵此間，輕車簡從，知者極少。</p>
<h3>讀者助學消息</h3>
<p>對於各種建議的答復</p>
<p>本報助學金辦事處，自上次向各界徽求意見後，收到建獲甚多。又辦事處主任沈有乾先生至各校參觀訪問時，亦承各校校畏或其他負責人員發表極有價　之意見。茲綜合作簡單答復如下：</p>
<p>關於選擇學生標準者：如應注重操行及服務精神，俱不成問題。辦事處現正研究辦法，俾下屆選擇可以更加周密。一部份意見以為如果家境確係淸寒，學業成續不應過度重視，此點亦有見地。惟成績方面相當的標準亦不可少，尤其在比較高級學校之學生，非但必幫淸塞，同時亦必需優秀，始有受助資格。因教育既未普及，優秀分子自應儘先予以機會，惟優秀當然不僅表示於分數等級，將來申請者如有特別專長，能提出證據者，自當予以特別老慮。</p>
<p>關於申請手續及甄別辦法者：如申請書應由學校代發，以省學生精力時間，如申請者之資格應先經學校審核，再由辦事處甄別，以求選擇嚴密，俱已經老慮，下屆決定實行。更有人提及核准應　資格，不可因名流介紹而通融者，按介紹人如能提出關於申請者家境或學行之確實證件，自可加以參老，僅講情面，當然不生效力。</p>
<p>關於聯絡學校及督促學生者：如參　學校，訪問校長，召集學生談話，現巳在進行中，請熱心人士注意，此後　希　各界人士繼續指教。　　昨收助金</p>
<p>昨日承內山完造先生慨助五萬元，按內山氏係本市北四川路底內山書店主人，致力中日文化事業垂數十年，厥功甚　。茲承慷概捐　，　惠淸寒學子，令人感佩無既。又承昭信堂捐助　字牌八十三號毛巾八打，　為義賣助學，併此誌謝。茲錄昨日捐款人台街如下：</p>

<h3>徐盧兩局長　任獻機會常委</h3>
<p>上海市政府鑒於大東亞戰爭已達決戰階段，印緬前綫捷報頻傳，獻機運動殊甚重要，陳市長為加強該會工作，特指派經濟局長徐天深，第二警察局長盧英，為上海市獻機運動委員會常務委員，常委增至五人，機構加強，工作自可順利，以達預期之目的。</p>
<h3>市糧局整理　南市戶口</h3>
<p>本市糧食局長馮攸為切實振刷糧政，強化配給擬構起見，決先在南市方面實施澈底整頓全區戶口，以期配給手續之更臻完密，自即日起由糧局發交該區各指定公　處申請配給證戶口登記表，由正尸長向各該公糶處領取詳細填報戶內所住之人數，姓名，年齡，以及居住證號碼，送由各該聯保長保甲長等加蓋印章，逕呈糧局審核，作為配米根據之淸冊，查是項表格，並不收取任何費用。</p>

<h3>星期評論　（自第一版轉來）</h3>
<p>一九一八年墨西哥油田公司總經理福魯巴兩，曾公開說過：「墨西哥革命的內幕眞相，是皮爾司所發動的。他握有皮爾司。奧塔斯煤油公司的百分之三十五股票，而該公司又持有美孚油公司的百分之六十五股票。同時，他是洛克斐勒（Rfeller）財閥利益的擁護者。這位皮爾司，曾要求提阿士（Diza）大總統取消煤油輸入稅。常然，這是因為希望能輸入美國煤油。提阿士大總統會加以拒絕。於是皮爾司就供給佛蘭西斯科。馬該勒金錢，發動革命。然而後來，竟出乎皮爾司和其他人的意外。美孚油公司派的佛蘭西斯科。馬該勒，於一九一三年二月十八日，受到排擊，且被維克多利亞派的休爾塔所處以徒刑。於是革命運動愈加蓬勃高漲，而反對休爾塔的北方維諾斯洽諾，加蘭皂與其部下潘潮。維拉的混戰，因而展開。」</p>
<p>這就可以充分明白了吧！總之，歷史業已證明：在墨西哥政府看，美國金融資本的要求，就是至上命令，假如出現不聽命的民族政治家，就會被「民衆意志」造成的「革命」所驅逐。必須記牢，墨西哥是民主國中的「獨立自山」的國家。因此，用民主的話來說，「完全獨立自主化」的前途，用我們的話來說，即「完全奴隸化」的危險，現在南美各國，都深切地體騐到，此外世界各國，縱有奴隸化程度上的差別，然而面前無不擺着這種民主奴隸化的危險。</p>
<p>第二個危險，就是美國金融瓷本家，為維持生產機構計，即追求絕對必要的戰爭（龐大消費事業），而經常窺親挑撥的機會。假如某兩國間發生糾紛，縱有可能政治結　，而美國金融資本家，也立刻加以利用，使之發展成為不可收拾的大規模戰爭。這類事實，此次世界大戰就是一個很好的例證。最初美國，雖公開聲明不參加世界大戰，然而卻對英法大量輸出軍需品。藉此以高度鼓舞國內產業。金融瓷本家也希望政府，逐漸大量輸出軍需品。華盛頓政府為了響應這一希望，而終於頒佈了七十億金元的軍火租借法案。山於軍火租借法案的債務國，有被軸心國擊價的危險日益擴大，於是美國政府，又經過第一次世界大戰時的同一過程，為使國民捲入戰爭漩渦，而嗾使國內輿論主張參戰。所以誰都明白，常時參戰只是時間問題。參戰目的，在於爭取實際的世界領導權，這在參戰時，愈加彰明較著了（這一傾向，特別在大西洋憲章和開羅會議上，明白表現出來）。</p>
<p>總之，世界各國，在實質上，是服從美國支配下的世界舊秩序呢。抑是摧毀這一舊秩序，而建立新秩序呢，非此即彼，二者必擇其一。想走後一道路者，就是西方德國建立歐洲新秩序的運動，東方日本建立東亞新秩序的運動，這一點或許是用不着加以詳盡說明的吧！所謂新秩序運動，在某種意義上說，就是日德兩國反抗美國金融資木家的自衛運動。自然，單純這一點還不能充分說明美國性格，而在實際意義上說，其主要動機在於確立國家的「獨立自主」性，在於奠定其民族後世的繁榮基礎。</p>
<p>然而此處所成為間題者，是新秩序的構造。假如反對美國（彼也以英國為附庸）金融資本家所支配下的世界，而另外創逃其他金融資本家所支配下的新世界，則在形式上，縱令是新秩序，然在實質上，不過是舊秩序的變相。對於這稱構造的新秩序，正如前此日德兩國反對美國金融資本時一樣，自然就會產生不滿日德兩國領導的民族。同時假如是為了某一民族繁榮，而抑制其他民族繁榮的，這種反乎道義，達乎公理的狹隘「民族生義」橫行的新秩序，則無論怎樣耗費代價加以創造，而都是徒勞無益。日本在大東亞範園內，現在擺在面前的大問題，實際就是這一點。關於日本自己想要創造大東亞新秩序，是必須眞實地重新檢討一下其他大東亞各民族的意向，尤共是中華民族的意向。我相信，中國在密切注視着日本。假如日本將來應當完成的大東亞新秩序之構造，能在實踐上證明，是保障中華民族眞正獨立自主的，則中國人就會心悅誠服，參加建設大東亞。中國人自從辛亥革命以來，本來就經歷過多年的反帝鬥爭，所以對於美國金融資本家的世界統治，絕對不會不知道。對於日本藉大東亞戰爭，肅淸了亞洲內部的美國金融資本勢力，那來同一黃種人的中國人，常然也感覺到揚眉吐氣。然則抗戰區的中國人，為什麼不積極幫助日本！這是因為對於日本發動的大東亞新秩序之建設運動形式，與該運動過程上對華政策之實踐，有所懷疑所致</p>
<p>我們日本人，對於中國人運種疑問，現在必須給以切實的解答。對於巾國人，已經不是單純在禮貌上，隨便可以敷衍了事的時期了。為了解除他們的疑問，只有言行一致的眞正態度，才發生效力。我以日本人的身價，為解答這一困難問題計，而才寫「日本的反省與中國的革新」論文集一書。因此，本書內並不談政策，也不談理想，而只是提供一部自我妣判所必要的老實話。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>肺病胃病痔病　國人患者最多　本處贈送特效藥</h3>
<p>本處自創辦醫藥助金，蒙社會人士竭力贊助救濟，捐款相當可觀，因此得以贈醫，贈藥，使一般貧病無吿者解除極大困難，造福人羣，良匪淺鮮。惟查歷來施治統計，患肺病胃病者最多，共次則為痔病，後者雖有割治療法，奏效尚速，但費用已至可觀，至若前者則非有長期療養與珍貴之藥劑不為功。本處經濟無多，自難為普遍久長之協助，此所謂搏施濟衆，聖者亦雜也。今幸有本埠常德路茲安藥廠主人章慈安君，熱心公益，尤極關懷上述諸病之貧乏病家，特願將其治肺治胃與治痔之特效藥，以牛價售　興本處，轉施病者。茲己由本處購進一批，凡患有此病面無力醫治者，憑服務機關證明，確係淸寒，於五月一日起可至本處索取，每人以一服為限，不取分文，其須多索者，照付藥費，亦得加配。又本處為測驗此種藥劑收效程度起見，試服之後，希望予以詳之盡報告。</p>

<h3>Preface to the Japanese Version of "Japan's Reflection and China's Reform"</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>Many Japanese residing in China have witnessed and heard about the lives of Asian peoples. Assuming this morality only exists within the lives of the Japanese people, manifesting as a new system, while the old system remains unchanged in the lives of the people of allied China, then hoping that the people of both countries will be of one heart and mind, fighting shoulder to shoulder for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, is like trying to climb a tree to catch a fish. As Japan sees it, China's affairs can no longer be considered unrelated matters of another country, just as Japan's affairs are not those of another country to China.</p>
<p>The saying "China is China, Japan is Japan" is, of course, something that Japanese people with strong solipsistic tendencies should carefully consider. However, superficially, it is filled with an atmosphere of narrow-minded nationalism. As it stands, it seems to assume that the living problems of the Chinese people are internal Chinese matters and have nothing to do with Japan. This goes against the purpose of the new policy, and therefore Japan only focuses on its wartime system, only focusing on the "unity of one hundred million compatriots." Naturally, today's war requires the mobilization of the total power of the nation; however, the Greater East Asia War cannot succeed with Japan's total mobilization alone. The Greater East Asia War can only succeed when all Asian peoples participate with their total power. If anyone denies this, they are taking the Greater East Asia War too lightly. The United States has vassal states in North and South America, and Britain has many overseas territories. Chongqing occupies most of China's land. Each is mobilizing all resources and manpower to deal with Japan. Japan dares to fight bravely alone because it is supported by a spiritual power that transcends ordinary war science. This spiritual backing is the moral character of this war. If Japan rises up to fight for the independence of Asia, then other Asian peoples will also rise up to fight for the independence of Asia--if there is no such conviction and one believes this war can be won, then that person's ability to think is probably highly questionable.</p>
<p>In the past four or five years, Japan has continuously criticized Anglo-American ways of thinking. Thus, in opposition to Anglo-American ways of thinking, an Eastern way of thinking has been reactively established, namely, opposing the "logical method" and mistakenly establishing the "intuitive method." Because the Eastern way of thinking values experience and its form of expression is symbolic, people unknowingly develop a habit of looking down on the logic of thought principles. However, one cannot think without logic. So-called intuition is a leap in thought that occurs when thought develops logically to its extreme. Intuition is the perception when thought leaps in the logical stage and stands at a higher level. Standing in this position, one will recognize the previous logical experience. Therefore, intuition does not negate logic; rather, it is the culmination of logic. However, Japan says that future humans will consider "guts" more important than the brain. In order to create "guts," one needs to exert force in the *dantian* (丹田), and practice the physiological thinking method of preparing for action (?). "Guts" is the result of various logical thoughts and pursuits, feeling that there is no other way, that it must be decided in this way. The so-called "boldly going forward" is the result of logically thinking about all possible events that may occur in one's usual surroundings. Even if an unexpected event occurs, one will find a way to deal with it intuitively. Those who do not usually rack their brains and practice logical thinking, yet easily achieve "confidence," are people who mistake "delusion" for "intuition." Such people may be rich in action, but their actions are like "Don Quixote" charging at a windmill.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that Japan boldly launched the Greater East Asia War as a result of various theoretical considerations, and there was no other way. No matter how serious and pressing the situation of the Greater East Asia War is, those who believe that there is no other way but to launch it will not waver. If the Japanese people's belief in the future of the war wavers even slightly, it is because they have not thoroughly pursued logical thinking and are vainly satisfied with the "delusion" of "confidence." So, what is it that forced Japan to launch the Greater East Asia War? On this point, let us briefly explain the situation of various countries on the eve of the World War.</p>
<p>In 1917, the loans that the Allied Powers borrowed from American bankers amounted to as much as 1.5 billion gold dollars. At that time, the situation on the Allied side was not good. If the Allied Powers succumbed to Germany, then naturally the American loans would not return to the hands of American bankers. This would be a crisis for American bankers, especially the Morgan financial group, and also a common crisis for American financial capitalists. Due to the First European War, the American shipbuilding industry, machinery industry, military industry, and other industries have made rapid progress. Americans never wanted the war to end in the short term, causing their prosperity to fall into a deep abyss. Therefore, with the Morgan financial group as the vanguard, they demanded that President Wilson bring the United States into the war. This was the beginning of the United States' quest for world leadership. As a result, when the war was declared over due to Germany's defeat, the difficulties they encountered were even more serious than during the war. The question was how to maintain the American production mechanism that had developed during the war. American financial capitalists solved this problem by adopting the Dawes Plan of 1924. For example, the United States lent part of its capital to Germany and forced Germany to buy American goods, that is, creating "artificial" purchasing power, attempting to maintain American prosperity. The United States also copied this method and applied it to other European countries. Therefore, post-war American capitalism was temporarily blessed and enjoyed high prosperity. Thus, the United States believed that capitalism could prosper forever, so it named it "Eternal Prosperity." However, the "Eternal Prosperity" of the United States naturally had a certain limit, a point that anyone with common sense had long known. In other words, as long as a world mechanism where countries had to buy American goods--a world mechanism dominated by American financial capital--existed, it would prosper. This world mechanism actually only existed for five years, until 1929. At that time, German and other European capitalism, which had been revived by American loans, improved its unprecedentedly huge production capacity. These countries not only no longer needed to buy American goods, but also had to export their own products to all parts of the world. Therefore, what inevitably occurred was global overproduction. As a result, the "Eternal Prosperity" of the United States suddenly declared its demise, but what took its place was a worldwide depression. Although the depression era lasted for four years of destructive blows until 1933, it did not restore formal prosperity in the following years. At that time, the total number of unemployed people in the world was said to be 30 to 50 million, that is, even in the United States alone, the number of unemployed people reached as many as seven or eight million.</p>
<p>Dealing with this unemployment problem and how American capitalism would regain control of the world were the second propositions that American financial capitalists gave to the Washington government. Roosevelt's New Deal was born to solve this problem. The main points of the New Deal are as follows: 1. Absolutely maintain the high standard of living of American workers (this is necessary to make the "worker aristocracy" support the foreign policy of the American government and maintain the internal market of the United States). 2. Guarantee the lives of as many as 7 million unemployed people with a national subsidy system (this is necessary to maintain the political leadership of the financial capitalists who are in flux). 3. In order to implement the above two major policies, create a huge national consumption industry, and the huge funds required are supplemented by deficit public bonds.</p>
<p>This means that the government uses the policy of "plundering the rich to help the poor" to gain the support of workers on the one hand, and on the other hand, the government frequently uses huge national budgets to squander money to protect the interests of capitalists. The United States uses this policy of unlimitedly squandering money to try to save the day and maintain artificial prosperity. Of course, in order to maintain the huge productive capacity of the United States, it is necessary to establish a huge consumer industry. And war is the most needed consumer industry for materials, and for the world's most powerful American productive capacity, naturally, the world war is the only largest-scale consumer industry. Therefore, countries outside the United States face two dangers due to the above-mentioned inevitable requirements of American financial capital. The first danger is to completely succumb to the American financial capitalists. Any product that competes with American products must stop manufacturing. Whether they are willing or not, they must import American goods and must export raw materials according to their requirements. This is nothing more than completely becoming a slave to American financial capital. The most obvious example is the "independent and free" democratic country of Mexico. Let me give an interesting example to illustrate the situation in that country. (The following turns to page four.)</p>

In just eleven months, it was fully completed in the middle of this month. In order to celebrate the completion of the Jinwu Railway and to thank the assistance and guidance of China and Japan, the China Railway Company held a grand inauguration ceremony in Wuyi on the 26th of this month and invited officials from relevant authorities in China and Japan and guests from all parties to participate in the grand ceremony. The situation was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

It is also said that the new minister will not change any of the personnel in the ministry.</p>
<h3>Six Items Including Guangdong Sugar Allowed to Resume Export</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Guangdong Provincial Economic Bureau previously prohibited the export of thirteen items, including rice. Because bran is related to spring plowing, it should be restored first and exported. This has already been announced and implemented. The investigation of inventory has been largely completed. After careful consideration of the situation, it was decided that sugar, beans, flour, matches, cotton, and cotton cloth will be allowed to resume export from April 26. The remaining items such as grain, crude oil, raw kernels, and gold are still temporarily prohibited from being transferred.</p>
<h3>Fierce Japanese Assault on Palel: Enemy Begins Full Retreat; Imphal Also Nears Fall</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 29th – Enemy forces at the strategic choke point of Palel within the Imphal Basin have been under relentless attack by Japanese-Indian allied forces for days and are now unable to withstand the pressure. They have begun a full retreat. The second line of key strongholds on the Palel highway, including Jaj Bam and Shenam, have already been lost. The main force of the enemy's 23rd Division at Palel, numbering about 12,000, fearing encirclement by Japanese forces, abandoned their plan to defend Palel to the death on the evening of the 25th and at dawn on the 26th. They now intend to establish a final defense line at Heights 4562, leaving only a small force in the first line of trenches at Geljaga to attempt to slow the fierce Japanese-Indian allied advance. The main force of the enemy's 20th Division at Palel began retreating towards Wakching, 20 kilometers north of Palel and 25 kilometers southeast of Imphal, on the 26th. The main force of a certain Japanese army group is relentlessly attacking the crumbling enemy forces along the Palel highway and in the Yakuma River valley, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Part of the force has already broken through into Kunuda, 7 kilometers north of Palel, and another powerful elite unit has breached the remaining enemy defenses and is continuing its advance towards a location very close to Imphal. The enemy is in chaos.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th – According to dispatches from the Indian front, Japanese forces attacking Imphal have been steadily approaching the core of the enemy's defenses since the start of the general offensive. At the same time, the advancing strike force has destroyed the large reservoir 20 kilometers northwest of Imphal, causing great panic among the enemy. Furthermore, the Palel fortress, the most heavily defended strongpoint in the basin located at the eastern entrance, has been abandoned after repeated Japanese assaults, and a general retreat has begun as of the 26th. On the Bishenpur front in the southwest of the basin, the battle situation is also rapidly progressing in favor of the Japanese. The Japanese forces' campaign to capture the various fortresses around Imphal in the past twenty days has been steadily progressing. Moreover, thanks to the cooperation of the air force, the campaign against the enemy's aerial supply lines has been extremely effective. The fall of Imphal is now imminent.</p>
<h3>Japan and Manchukuo to Implement Entry-Exit Tax Exemptions Next Month to Promote Smooth Flow of Goods</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th – Japan and Manchukuo, in order to promote the smooth flow of goods and to achieve a high degree of development in the overall economic strength of both countries, have decided to abolish tariffs between the two countries. At the same time, they have decided to thoroughly simplify the procedures for the exchange of goods, passengers, and funds between the two countries. As a result of negotiations between the governments of both countries, consensus has been reached, and it has been decided to implement this starting on the first of next month. At 3:00 PM on the 29th, the Japanese Information Bureau issued the following statement: As a result of consultations between Japan and Manchukuo, the following measures have been decided upon in order to further facilitate wartime transportation and increase combat strength: Japan will exempt import duties on products from Manchukuo and the Kwantung Leased Territory during the Greater East Asia War. Manchukuo will similarly exempt import duties on products from Japan and the Kwantung Leased Territory. At the same time, Japan will also exempt export duties on products destined for Manchuria. Customs procedures for goods traded between Japan and Manchukuo will be simplified as much as possible, based on the principle of preventing illegal exports and relying on documentary review. Restrictions on luggage carried by passengers between Japan and Manchukuo will be simplified as much as possible, except in cases involving suspicion of violating public order, hindering security, espionage, or economic controls. Matters concerning exchange management and trade regulations between Japan and Manchukuo will be simplified as much as possible. Procedures for passenger handling will also be simplified. These measures will be implemented independently by Japan and Manchukuo, starting on May 1st.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Recovering</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 29th – A dispatch from Bombay states: The Bombay Provincial Government announced yesterday that Gandhi has recovered his health after suffering from a fever a few days ago.</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox Dies; Under Secretary to Act as Head</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 29th – Reuter reports: Washington officials announced that U.S. Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox died suddenly yesterday at the age of 70. Under Secretary James Forrestal (age 48) is the most likely candidate to succeed him, but Wendell Willkie has also been mentioned. Forrestal will continue to serve as acting secretary until President Roosevelt formally appoints a new Navy Secretary.</p>
<h3>Germany Actively Prepares for Future Battles; Biscay Bay Defenses Consolidated</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th – The German News Agency reports: Both sides are intensifying their offensive activities on the Eastern Front, while on the Western Front, German forces are increasing their activity at various points ahead of the planned Anglo-American offensive. This is the current situation.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th – The German News Agency reports: A unit of German engineers has constructed a formidable obstacle zone, covering a depth of approximately twenty kilometers in the Bay of Biscay area within eight days. Within this short period, the engineers have laid over 200,000 landmines of various types and constructed over 100 kilometers of barbed wire obstacles, making the area a death trap for both men and tanks.</p>
<p>Imminent Attack on the Balkans</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Zurich, 29th – Reuter reports: Well-informed sources here report that an Allied attack on the Balkans is imminent. It is reported that large Anglo-American forces are concentrated in the Near East, and Allied Mediterranean fleets are frequently traveling off the Greek coast. It is believed that the Allied forces' attack on the Balkans is intended to aid the guerrillas under General Tito within Yugoslavia.</p>
<h3>Japan's Military Strength is Solid; Confidence in Victory; Minister Matsushima Speaks in Beijing</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) In order to break through Japan's defensive iron ring in the South Pacific islands, the enemy has suffered repeated losses. Recently, the enemy seems to be imitating Germany's old tactics of attacking Poland by mobilizing a large number of aircraft to assist in the forward areas.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the enemy's strategic objective is to use these islands as a bridge to the Chinese mainland. Therefore, they are doing their utmost to obstruct the consolidation of Japanese military strength and are deploying real troops wherever there are resources. At the same time, in parallel with this strategy, they have deployed more than fifty submarines in the Japanese inner lines to conduct a naval transportation blockade operation. However, due to Japan's strong defenses, the enemy's attempt ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Preemptive Strike</p>
<p>The achievements of the Japanese Army in the India-Burma region have dealt a severe blow to the enemy, not only hindering the construction of the Ledo Road but also forcing the relocation of the Allied Southeast Asia Command to the mountains of Ceylon. In the future, the enemy may launch a flank attack on Japanese forces from the Indian Ocean. If this is indeed the case, it should be noted that not only are the climatic conditions unsuitable today, but also the necessary large fleet is unlikely to be formed before the Second Front is established. Recently, the enemy conducted an air raid on Sabang Island in Sumatra, but this was merely a reconnaissance and diversionary tactic. The enemy is currently promoting the idea of uniting the defeated fleets of Britain, America, the Netherlands, Australia, and even Italy to participate in this operation.</p>
<p>The enemy, accustomed to fabricating propaganda, is using extremely clumsy tactics this time. It is not worth laughing at. "There are no great generals in Shu; Liao Hua acts as the vanguard." Even the Italian Badoglio regime is being dragged out to fight for them, which is truly pitiful. They cannot even fight for their own country with their limited strength, which is deeply lamentable. Secondly, attention must be paid to the activities of the enemy's air force on the Chinese mainland. Today, the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force are constantly taking preemptive action to inflict severe blows on the enemy. The Japanese Army, which crossed the Himalayas from India, has cut off the enemy's supply lines, and the war in that area is gradually unfolding favorably. The enemy's ultimate goals are to carry out air raids on the Japanese mainland and to disrupt transportation in the south. However, Japan will, at the hands of the Japanese military, annihilate the arrogant enemy one by one. This is entirely not a problem. At the same time, the civilian population is working hard to consolidate the air defense system, so there is no need to worry about enemy air raids. The air defense tasks being carried out in various places are currently very active. The Anglo-American forces are attempting to concentrate the power of their army, navy, and air force in Chongqing to deal with Japan. As this Greater East Asia War enters its final stage, we must embrace the conviction of certain victory and crush the Anglo-American ambition to control the Chinese mainland. We must thoroughly destroy it.</p>
<p>Striving for Final Victory</p>
<p>U.S. military commentator Lieutenant Colonel Cagana once elucidated on America's offensive operations as follows:</p>
<p>"The United States should have invaded China during the Manchurian Incident. If so, China, in order to protect Manchurian territory, would have had to devote all its efforts to building aircraft factories and military airfields throughout China and East Asia as bases on the Chinese mainland, in order to accumulate the raw materials and resources necessary for strategic purposes. As a result, the United States would have had at least 300,000 troops stationed in China."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen where America's true intentions lie. It is fundamentally different from Japan's just cooperation today. Therefore, Chongqing should give it deep consideration. Today, Japan's operations are based on the fundamental concept of striving for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War and preventing Anglo-American aggression against China, so that China's land and people can be spared from the ravages of war. This is also the ideal of the Greater East Asia Declaration.</p>
<p>On the other hand, regarding the situation in Europe, the establishment of the Anglo-American Second Front has become the top priority. Therefore, general speculation is that the Anglo-Americans may attempt this sometime in May. We deeply respect the indomitable spirit of the Germans. By resisting the establishment of the enemy's Second Front, the Germans are demonstrating their true strength and are embarking on a great and glorious enterprise for the construction of a new Europe.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War, running parallel to the European War, is now gradually entering a critical stage. By combining the full strength of China and Japan to strike down the stubborn enemy, we can simultaneously achieve the great task of destroying Britain and America in both the East and the West.</p>
<p>Japan's winning posture has become increasingly solid. In the future, it will increasingly demonstrate the wonders of its strategy. However, in order to maximize the effectiveness of this strategy, we must have immense strength in both material and spiritual terms. This is the unwavering belief and resolute action of the people in the rear, the so-called economic warfare and ideological warfare, which are the only ways for those in the rear to support the soldiers on the front lines. The continuation of three thousand years of glorious history in East Asia and the glorious construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere – these two heavy responsibilities rest on our shoulders. It is our sincere hope that in this decisive autumn, we will strive for victory with the determination to serve the state unto death. (The End)</p>
<h3>Germany's Lightning Measures Succeed in the Balkans</h3>
<p>The center of gravity of the Eastern Front has shifted from Ukraine to the Balkans. The Soviet First Ukrainian Front, under Marshal Zhukov, aims to break through the Carpathian Mountains via Chernivtsi; the Second Ukrainian Front, under Marshal Konev, aims for Iasi, penetrating Romania; and the Third Ukrainian Front, under General Malinovsky, is advancing from Mykolaiv towards Odessa. The Red Army's future strategic locations are: first, to advance southwest from Romania, reach the Danube, and attempt to sweep across the Danube Plain; second, to concentrate its main force to attack central and southern Poland. In short, the Red Army will continue all offensive operations to the extent of its power to disperse the German defensive lines.</p>
<p>Strengthening Southeast European Fortresses</p>
<p>Germany, facing the Balkan crisis, has already moved into Hungary, and at the same time, is actively seeking to maintain the security of Romania and Bulgaria, devoting all its efforts to strengthening the first line of Southeast European fortresses. The general headquarters declared that this maneuver was performed to help the Badoglio regime. So far, Germany's lightning measures have been successful, and it has invisibly prevented the internal political turmoil that the Anglo-Americans hoped for.</p>
<p>In Hungary, a new cabinet led by former ambassador to Germany, Döme Sztójay, has replaced the Kállay cabinet, secretly carrying out a purge of the country with the Arrow Cross Party's Imrédy faction in the background. Chief of Staff Kuden Tayich entered and served as Minister of the Army, clarifying that the cooperation of the Hungarian military with Germany would not change.</p>
<p>As for Romania, it has already sacrificed hundreds of thousands of lives in three years of war against the Soviet Union. Now, under the threat of the Soviet Union, the country's leaders, such as General Antonescu, are not considering peace issues, and they are paying special attention to the security of Romania, especially because of the Ploiești oil fields. If the Soviet army continues to advance further into Romanian territory in the future, and the current government is unable to control the country, the Iron Guard will come forward to maintain order. The leaders of the peasant party, Maniu, and the volunteer party, Iuliu Maniu, whom the Anglo-Americans had hoped to use, currently have no political power and have no room for anti-government activity.</p>
<p>Crisis in Bulgaria's Internal Affairs</p>
<p>The guiding force in the current Bulgarian government is the regency government organized by Prince Kirill and former Prime Minister Filov after the collapse of Boris V. Because they are fellow Slavic peoples, the influence of the Soviet Union is quite deep in the folk, so they did not participate in the war against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is also secretly trying to encourage pro-Soviet factions in the country to become active, and ordered former Third International Secretary-General Georgi Dimitrov (a Bulgarian) to sneak in. Germany attaches particular importance to Bulgaria, and does not neglect to be vigilant, for this reason.</p>
<p>In short, if there is any weakening phenomenon in the aforementioned three Balkan countries of the first line of Southeast European fortresses, it will threaten Germany's lifeline. Therefore, the measures taken to strengthen the security of the three countries earlier were quite timely. The German army, with the natural barrier of the Carpathian Mountains as its background, if it can stop the Soviet army's attack on the lines of Galați, Iasi, Chernivtsi, and Lviv, then Southeast Europe, politically, can be even more stable.

At 10:50 AM, the Koa Hokokukai held a grand celebration ceremony at Hongkou Park. Japanese residents of the city gradually arrived to attend. At the time, they all faced the Imperial Palace to celebrate His Majesty's birthday and wish the Imperial Family prosperity. Then, they sang the national anthem, followed by Consul General Yano respectfully reading the Imperial Rescript and the Koa Hokokukai President reading congratulatory remarks. Finally, the entire group sang the Emperor's Birthday Commemorative Song, and Chairman Yasui of the Civilian Council led a triple banzai cheer, bringing the grand celebration ceremony to a close.</p>
<p>Aircraft Naming Ceremony</p>
<p>Japanese organizations and shops in this city, in order to express their sincere patriotism, donated aircraft to the Army and Navy authorities. The aircraft dedication and naming ceremony was held yesterday afternoon at Hongkou Park. Lieutenant General Nagatsu of the Army, Admiral Kondo of the Navy, Minister Usa, Consul General Yano, Commander Gojo of the Army Minister's representative unit, and Commander Kondo of the Navy Minister's representative China Fleet Command entered the venue with their staff. Everyone stood at attention and sang the Japanese national anthem, opening the solemn and grand ceremony. At the front of the venue were the fifty-six donated aircraft. On the right side were the seats for the Army and Navy ministers, followed by the Army and Navy generals and the band. In front were the representatives of the aircraft donors: Mr. Kuroda Keitaro, President of Shanghai Textile Company, Mr. Kobayashi Mamoru, President of China Central Silk Company, and twenty-two representatives from Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and other major trading companies and Japanese organizations in Shanghai. In addition, there were Consul General Yano, Civilian Leader Watanabe, local government and civilian representatives, general guests, and students from various schools. At the beginning of the ceremony, a purification rite, invocation of the gods, and offerings were performed. Then, Chief Priest Tsuruta Yasuyoshi of the Shanghai Shrine reverently read the congratulatory address. The representatives of the Army and Navy ministers and the representatives of the donors named the aircraft and offered tamagushi, with thunderous applause filling the venue. Pilots in flight suits stood respectfully in front of the aircraft, receiving bouquets of flowers and amulets from young girls. The flower-presenting girls, Fujii Fukuko, Shimoda Miyako, Kadota Yoshiko, and Torii Yodoko, recited their words of blessing: "May these flowers and amulets protect your beloved aircraft on its sortie, and may it return victorious." The three thousand attendees at the ceremony clapped their hands in unison, praying for lasting military fortune. Then, as the naval band played music and scattering confetti, everyone stood up together, the spirits rose, and the Army and Navy ministers presented letters of appreciation to the donors. Mr. Kuroda Keitaro, President of Shanghai Textile Company, and twelve others represented the Army aircraft donors, while Mr. Kobayashi Mamoru, President of China Central Silk Company, and twenty-two others represented the Navy aircraft donors, and they each received letters of appreciation. At this time, three fighter planes circled overhead, expressing their congratulations, and 200 elementary school students sang the naming song. The naming committee chairman then gave a speech, and Consul General Yano, representing the guests, led the triple banzai cheer, bringing the ceremony to a successful conclusion. Afterward, the Army and Navy military bands held a grand commemorative performance.</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Holds Medical Lecture; Invites Japanese Representative from Medical Association to Speak</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Cultural Association of this city, taking advantage of the rare opportunity presented by the gathering of representatives from various countries attending the Third Medical Congress in Shanghai, and fulfilling its mission of cultural exchange, specially requested Mr. Hayashi Haruo, the Japanese representative at the event, to deliver a special lecture yesterday (29th) morning at 10:00 AM at the Lyceum Theatre. Over a thousand students from the National Shanghai Medical College, St. John's University Medical School, Tongji Medical School, Southeast Medical College, Aurora University, Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and New China Medical College attended. After an introduction by a representative of the association, Mr. Hayashi Haruo delivered a lecture entitled "New Pathways in Medicine," elaborating on the purpose of medicine as striving for the health of humanity, with the nation, ethnicity, and society as the object. It is not simply to treat the diseases of a few people, it is not a narrow definition of health, but a broad definition of health. He went on to say that medicine for the health of the nation and ethnicity should focus on how the entire nation prevents diseases and the spread of infectious diseases. Finally, he touched on the population problem in East Asia, in terms of population productivity, and the future new hopes of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, contrasting it with the fact that in countries such as England and the United States, the population is gradually decreasing despite having relatively good public health facilities, which is a sign of a country declining. Subsequently, Wushan Pharmaceutical Factory presented medical films entitled "Brain Tumors" and "Medical Japan," with excellent content, and the event did not conclude until 12:00 noon. It is reported that the association is scheduled to continue this morning at 10:00 AM, requesting Mr. Miyakawa Yoneji to lecture on the topic "The Special Characteristics of Medical Treatment and Ethnicity," and 武田藥廠 will present "Documentary on Self-Harm Among the Mentally Ill," "X-Ray Diagnosis of Duodenal Ulcers," and 製藥.</p>
<h3>Successful Conclusion of the Medical Congress: Reflections from Representatives of Various Countries</h3>
<p>The Third East Asia Medical Congress, aimed at ensuring the health of a billion people in East Asia and promoting medicine in the Greater East Asia region, concluded successfully the day before yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Chu Minyi, the President of the Congress, Mr. Lu Runzhi, the Vice-President, and representatives from various countries yesterday (the 29th), who shared their thoughts as follows:</p>
<p>President Chu Minyi</p>
<p>Currently, East Asian countries are at war for justice, a time when material and human resources are insufficient. It is extremely valuable and gratifying to be able to hold such a grand and meaningful international academic conference, bringing together scholars from various Greater East Asian countries to jointly discuss and present new academic achievements and insights. It also demonstrates the spirit of unity and cooperation among the people and governments of East Asia, which is not merely empty talk. The future of East Asia is bright, and this is something to be celebrated. Recalling the East Asia Medical Association, the first congress only included China, Japan, Manchuria, and Vietnam. It gradually expanded, and this congress included seven countries: China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Apart from India, which could not participate due to its struggle for national freedom, I believe that this association will definitely make great contributions in the future.</p>
<p>Vice-President Lu Runzhi</p>
<p>Today, the Third East Asia Medical Congress has successfully concluded. As the chief of the national health administration, I would like to briefly express my thoughts on the congress. The East Asia Medical Association has only a short history of three years, but its development during these three years has been truly astonishing. In terms of the number of participating countries, it has included all independent countries in East Asia within three years. In terms of the content of the presentations, the new theories and technologies presented each year have been increasing and becoming more substantial. In terms of the number of members, it has increased from just over a hundred at the beginning to over a thousand now. These points are sufficient to demonstrate the enthusiasm among scholars from East Asian countries. This phenomenon is not only admirable but also exciting for all of us. The medical standards and public health knowledge in our country have always been backward. The holding of this East Asia Medical Congress in our country has at least provided the current Chinese people with a clear understanding.</p>
<p>Japanese Representative Hayashi Haruo</p>
<p>The Third East Asia Medical Congress was held in China this time. The opening ceremony was held at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association in Nanjing on the first day. Subsequently, lectures were held at Aurora University in Shanghai on the 26th, 27th, and 28th. Attendees included many medical scholars and health administration personnel from China, including President Chu Minyi, as well as dozens of representatives from Japan, over ten from Manchuria, and representatives from Vietnam and Burma (the Thai representative had not yet arrived due to climate conditions), totaling no less than two hundred people, making it an unprecedentedly grand occasion. There were eight special lectures and over a hundred ordinary lectures, all of which were the result of years of investigation and research by various scholars, making significant contributions to academia. A special feature of this congress was that, regarding the six research topics designated at the Second East Asia Medical Congress held in Tokyo last year, committees were established for each area, and they were able to present the results of their investigations and research. Small group committees were convened in the form of roundtable meetings to exchange opinions and learn from each other, with the aim of continuing the discussion next year. As for the details of this conference, a report was given at the venue on the 28th. The research topics included tuberculosis, leprosy, venereal diseases, and acute infectious diseases, all of which are the most relevant issues during wartime.</p>
<p>Philippine Representative</p>
<p>The Third East Asia Medical Congress has successfully concluded. We are honored to have been invited by the National Government of China to participate, and we would like to express our deepest gratitude on behalf of the Republic of the Philippines. As we return to our country, we have beautiful and indelible impressions of your country and its people, especially of the historical city of Nanjing and the major commercial port of Shanghai. We are deeply moved by the assistance of your country's senior officials in the completion of this congress. We hope that in the near future, the Philippines will also have the opportunity to host such an event to reciprocate your country's kindness.</p>
<p>Vietnamese Representative Le Na</p>
<p>I, representing the medical and pharmaceutical circles of Vietnam, have attended this grand event and presented a report on our recent work achievements to the congress, hoping for guidance from experts from friendly countries. I believe that in the current era, every corner of the world is facing the same situation. The implementation of public health and healthcare has become the most important issue. The authorities of the East Asian allied countries, recognizing this need, have held a major medical congress once a year for the past three years, exchanging new medical knowledge to protect human health, which can be said to be the most wise and effective strategy.</p>
<p>Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory Hosts Banquet for Representatives of the East Asia Medical Congress</p>
<p>The Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory in this city hosted a banquet at the Capital Hotel on the opening day of the Third East Asia Medical Congress to entertain all the representatives of the congress. Over two hundred people attended, including Dr. Chu Minyi, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and the President of this congress, Lu Lanzhi, the Director of the Department of Health, and presidents and members from China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, and other regions, as well as representatives from the German Medical College and the German Medical Association in this city. They gathered together in a joyous atmosphere. Mr. Ling, the Bayer representative for all of Asia, and Mr. Fei Xuande, the General Manager of Bayer China and Manchuria, delivered welcoming speeches. Finally, Dr. Weilbang, the Chairman of the Bayer Scientific Research Department, elaborated on the contributions made by the Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory to maintaining the health of the people of East Asia during the current wartime, and its contributions to the development of German medical affairs around the world. The banquet ended on a happy note.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Stock Market Problem</h3>
<p>The Shanghai stock market problem in today's street talk is either "Why are stocks still not recovering?" or "When can we expect stocks to rise?" If we limit the scope of discussion on the Shanghai stock market problem to these two questions, we would be underestimating the future of Chinese stocks.</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai stock market problem, Mr. Ogura, the highest economic advisor, said in response to reporters' questions the other day: "The original motive for issuing stocks was to develop industrial and commercial enterprises. It must not be used for speculation, as this greatly affects financial affairs. In the future, those who engage in speculative behavior should be corrected to ensure normal trading." In a few words, he succinctly captured the meaning of stock issuance, the dangers of stock speculation, and the path that stock trading should follow.</p>
<p>How can stock trading be normalized so that it contributes to production and does not flow into speculation? This is a question that is of utmost concern to informed individuals in the economic sphere. We believe that the key to solving this problem, given the current stagnant and sluggish state of the entire securities market, seems to lie in two measures that should be taken: First, the government should adopt various effective methods to maintain the reasonable price of Chinese stocks, even imitating Japan's stock price control measures. Second, the business and securities sectors should deliberately implement securities according to a balanced plan, and even find ways to recover some of the overly rampant securities in circulation. In this way, we believe that the securities market can gradually stabilize, and at the same time, productive capital can be spared from a floating and unstable state, naturally contributing to the production of agriculture and industry. This is what we consider to be the key to the Shanghai stock market problem.</p>
<h3>Gu Baowei's Assets in Shanghai: District Procuratorate Ordered to Seize</h3>
<p>Gu Baowei, the former Minister of Food, was found to have abused his power for personal gain and was dismissed from his post and investigated by order of the National Government. He is being severely questioned by the Mountain Special Court in accordance with the law. According to a Central News Agency reporter, the local procuratorate in this city has been ordered by the Special Court to seize Gu's real estate and other properties in Shanghai. Therefore, the Chief Prosecutor of the Procuratorate, Mr. Shen Wenjie, specially appointed prosecutors Wu Lidong and Zhao Zhenyu to formally execute the seizure starting the other day.</p>
<h3>Justice Minister Zhang Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yipeng, the Minister of Judicial Administration of the National Government, came to Shanghai on official business and arrived here safely yesterday (the 29th) at 2:30 PM. He traveled in a simple manner with few attendants, and few people knew of his arrival.</p>
<h3>Reader Scholarship News</h3>
<p>Responses to Various Suggestions</p>
<p>Since our newspaper's scholarship office solicited opinions from all sectors of society last time, we have received many suggestions. Furthermore, Mr. Shen Youqian, the director of the office, received valuable opinions from school principals or other responsible personnel during his visits to various schools. A summary of simple responses is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the standards for selecting students: There is no question that emphasis should be placed on conduct and service spirit. The office is currently studying methods to make the selection process more thorough in the next round. Some opinions believe that if a student's family situation is truly impoverished, academic performance should not be overemphasized. This point is also insightful. However, a certain standard in terms of academic performance is also essential, especially for students in higher-level schools. Not only must they be impoverished, but they must also be excellent to be eligible for assistance. Since education is not yet universal, outstanding individuals should be given priority. However, excellence is of course not only expressed in grades. In the future, applicants who have special expertise and can provide evidence will be given special consideration.</p>
<p>Regarding application procedures and screening methods: It has already been considered that application forms should be issued by the schools to save students' energy and time, and that the qualifications of applicants should first be reviewed by the schools and then screened by the office to ensure rigorous selection, and the next round will be implemented accordingly. Someone also mentioned that eligibility should not be approved through special considerations based on introductions from celebrities. If the introducer can provide reliable documentation regarding the applicant's family situation or academic performance, it can be used as a reference. However, merely speaking based on personal connections will of course have no effect.</p>
<p>Regarding contacting schools and urging students: Visiting schools, interviewing principals, and convening student talks are already in progress. Please pay attention to those who are enthusiastic. We hope that people from all walks of life will continue to provide guidance in the future.</p>
<p>Assistance Received Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a generous donation of 50,000 yuan from Mr. Uchiyama Kanzo.

Starting immediately, the Grain Bureau will issue household registration forms for applying for allocation certificates to each designated public grain sales office in the area. The head of the household should obtain the forms from the respective public grain sales office, fill in the number of people living in the household, their names, ages, and residence permit numbers in detail, and submit them to the respective Lianbao Chief and Baojia Chief for stamping, and then directly submit them to the Grain Bureau for review as a list of rice allocation. It should be noted that there are no fees charged for these forms.</p>

<h3>Weekly Commentary (Continued from Page 1)</h3>
<p>In 1918, Mr. Frouba, the general manager of the Mexican Oil Company, publicly stated: "The truth behind the Mexican Revolution was initiated by Pierce. He held 35% of the shares in Pierce Oilotas Oil Company, which in turn held 65% of the shares in Mobil Oil Company. At the same time, he was a supporter of the Rockefeller (Rfeller) financial interests. This Pierce had requested President Dias to cancel the oil import tax, naturally because he hoped to import American oil. President Dias refused. So Pierce supplied Francisco Madero with money to start the revolution. However, to Pierce's and others' surprise, Francisco Madero, sent by Mobil Oil, was attacked on February 18, 1913, and sentenced to imprisonment by Huerta of the Victoria faction. As a result, the revolutionary movement became more vigorous and high-spirited, and the civil war between Venustiano Carranza in the north and his subordinates Pancho Villa began."</p>
<p>This should be clear enough! In short, history has proven that in the eyes of the Mexican government, the demands of American financial capital are supreme orders. If a national politician appears who does not obey, he will be driven out by a "revolution" created by "the will of the people." It must be remembered that Mexico is a "independent and free" country among democratic countries. Therefore, in democratic terms, the prospect of "complete independence and autonomy," or in our words, the danger of "complete enslavement," is now deeply felt by the countries of South America. In addition, although the degree of enslavement varies from country to country around the world, all face this danger of democratic enslavement.</p>
<p>The second danger is that American financial magnates, in order to maintain their production mechanisms, are constantly seeking opportunities to provoke absolutely necessary wars (large-scale consumption businesses). If a dispute occurs between two countries, even if a political settlement is possible, American financial magnates immediately take advantage of it to develop it into an unmanageable large-scale war. The World War is a good example of this type of fact. At first, the United States publicly declared that it would not participate in the World War, but it exported a large number of military supplies to Britain and France, thereby highly encouraging domestic industry. Financial magnates also hoped that the government would gradually export military supplies in large quantities. The Washington government responded to this hope and finally promulgated the Lend-Lease Act of 7 billion gold dollars. As the risk of debtor countries of the Lend-Lease Act being defeated by the Axis powers increased, the US government, following the same process as in World War I, incited domestic public opinion to advocate participation in the war in order to draw the people into the vortex of war. Therefore, everyone understood that participation in the war was only a matter of time. The purpose of participation was to strive for actual world leadership, which became increasingly clear during participation in the war (this tendency was especially evident in the Atlantic Charter and the Cairo Conference).</p>
<p>In short, will the world essentially submit to the old world order under American control, or will it destroy this old order and establish a new order? There are only two choices, and one must be chosen. Those who want to take the latter path are the German movement to establish a new European order in the West and the Japanese movement to establish a new East Asian order in the East. Perhaps this does not need to be explained in detail! The so-called new order movement, in a sense, is a defensive movement by Japan and Germany against American financial magnates. Naturally, this alone cannot fully explain the American character, but in a practical sense, the main motivation lies in establishing the "independent autonomy" of the country and in laying the foundation for the prosperity of its nation for generations to come.</p>
<p>However, what becomes a problem here is the construction of the new order. If the world dominated by American (with Britain as a vassal) financial magnates is opposed, and a new world dominated by other financial magnates is created, then even if it is a new order in form, it is essentially a disguised old order. For this type of constructed new order, just as Japan and Germany opposed American finance capital before, dissatisfaction with the leadership of Japan and Germany will naturally arise among other nations. At the same time, if it is for the prosperity of one nation while suppressing the prosperity of other nations, then no matter how much it costs to create this new order, which goes against morality and justice, and is characterized by narrow "nationalism," it will all be in vain. Japan, within the Greater East Asia area, is now facing this big problem. Regarding Japan's own desire to create a new Greater East Asia order, it is necessary to truly re-examine the intentions of other Greater East Asia nations, especially the intentions of the Chinese nation. I believe that China is closely watching Japan. If the construction of the new Greater East Asia order that Japan should complete in the future can practically prove that it guarantees the true independence and autonomy of the Chinese nation, then the Chinese people will wholeheartedly join the construction of Greater East Asia. Since the Xinhai Revolution, the Chinese people have experienced many years of anti-imperialist struggles, so they absolutely cannot be unaware of the world rule of American finance capitalists. The Chinese, who are of the same yellow race, naturally feel proud that Japan has eliminated the forces of American finance capital within Asia through the Greater East Asia War. However, why don't the Chinese in the anti-Japanese war zone actively help Japan? This is because they have doubts about the form of Japan's construction movement of the new Greater East Asia order and the practice of its policy towards China in the process of that movement.</p>
<p>We Japanese must now give a practical answer to the questions of the Chinese people. It is no longer a time when we can simply perfunctorily deal with the Chinese with mere politeness. Only a genuine attitude that is consistent in word and deed will be effective in dispelling their doubts. In my capacity as a Japanese, I wrote the book "Reflections of Japan and Innovations of China" in order to solve this difficult problem. Therefore, this book does not talk about policies or ideals, but only provides honest words necessary for self-criticism.</p>

<h3>Lung Disease, Stomach Disease, and Hemorrhoids: The Most Common Ailments Among Chinese; This Office Donates Effective Medicines</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of this office's medical and pharmaceutical aid fund, it has received vigorous support from people from all walks of life, and the donations have been quite considerable. Therefore, it has been possible to provide free medical care and medicines, alleviating the great difficulties of the general poor and sick who have no one to turn to, benefiting the population immensely. However, according to the statistics of past treatments, lung disease and stomach disease are the most common, followed by hemorrhoids. Although the latter has a surgical treatment method that is effective relatively quickly, the cost is already considerable. As for the former, it will not be effective without long-term recuperation and precious medicines. This office has limited funds and cannot provide widespread and long-term assistance. This is what is meant by "giving extensively to help the masses is also a mixture for the sages." Fortunately, Mr. Zhang Ci'an, the owner of the Zian Pharmaceutical Factory on Changde Road in this city, is enthusiastic about public welfare and is particularly concerned about impoverished patients suffering from the above-mentioned diseases. He is specially willing to sell his effective medicines for treating lung disease, stomach disease, and hemorrhoids at a low price to this office for distribution to patients. We have already purchased a batch from this office. Anyone who suffers from these diseases and is unable to afford treatment can present proof from their service organization that they are indeed impoverished and can come to this office to obtain the medicines starting May 1st. Each person is limited to one dose free of charge. Those who need to obtain more will have to pay the cost of the medicine and can also be given an additional dose. In addition, in order to test the effectiveness of these medicines, we hope that those who try them will provide a detailed report.</p>
<h3>School of Clerical Studies to Open Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The School of Clerical Studies, organized by this office, has received an overwhelming number of applicants since its preparation. It is now scheduled to officially open tomorrow (May 1st) at the Republican Middle School, Lane 2, No. 9 Weihaiwei Road. Class attendance permits have already been mailed. If you have not yet received yours, please write to this office to inquire.</p>
<p>Gongxingchang Donates Medicine to Shanghai Health Association The Shanghai Health Association has received a donation of medical assistance funds totaling eleven thousand yuan from Mr. Cheng Xiangzhi, Mr. Xia Caigui, and Mr. Liu Ding, the proprietors of Gongxingchang. Any impoverished apprentices in the hardware industry who are dismissed from their shops and can provide proof of their poverty from the shop or are referred by this service center, can visit the Health Association's outpatient clinic at 587 Jing'an Temple Road for medical examination (5 to 7 p.m.). All departments are available and medication is provided free of charge. The benevolent act of the proprietors of Gongxingchang is truly admirable.</p>
