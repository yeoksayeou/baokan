<p>社評</p>
<h3>力持鎭靜</h3>
<p>這刨日間，米價黑市入於閃電狀態，因為米是大衆生命所繫的必需品，所以，大衆對此閃電米價的焦慮，自然是人情之常。不過，焦應自焦慮，閃電自閃電，閃電的事實不因焦慮而減低程度，同時，焦慮以後，不免發生恐慌與失望心理，予不逞之徒利用生事之機會，徒然助簽閃電的氣燄，而於事無補。所以，與其焦慮而無裨實際，不如鎭靜而嚴切注視市當局與盟邦當局的措置，我們相信市當局與盟邦當局對於米糧問題有調整之決心，而且這種決心是基於人民要求的。不過在實施與措置之間，市當局未能單獨決定，因之發生若于未及預料的波折而已。我市波動，不論其原起何在，在當局立塲，亟應迅速挽救，不尚空言，而以事實安定人心。但另方遷，希望市民力持鎭靜，不必恐慌，以免增加當當局處理上的困難。昨天新聞報經濟社論，提出扼要的意見。大陸新報分析米價波動之原因，我們喬意下列數點：</p>
<p>米價暴漲，關係機關措置太遲。</p>
<p>不待具體細則準備完成，遽爾發表重大轉變之方針，因而米價之主動性，囤積米商反較米統會市府米動迅速。</p>
<p>難乞聲明廢除限制迷米，而非法武裝團儂依然限制運米。</p>
<p>縱謀立刻發給護照，採辦商將米運至上海，尚需相當時日，而不能短期內增加搬入量。</p>
<p>內地米商預料米糧自由運滬後，市價必貴，大多不肯運米來滬，反而國積</p>
<p>此次米親政策變史之結果，上海周圍附近地區，米統會及各地辦事處指定商之收買活動，全入停頓狀熊。</p>
<p>照例六。七。八。九四個月為青黃不接期，米價應貴。同時，我們必須補充者，重慶特務人員正在利用時機掀風作浪，故意喊出高價，裝做收買，造成有市有貨模樣，一方面完成共擾亂人心的目標，一方面可以向重慶報銷。這是不能不注意的。共次，奸商狼狽為奸，操縱黑市，遂共暴利企圖。現在市政當局已經佈告，在本市米糧搬入口管理辦法未公布以前，各採辦商及附近農民搬運米殺來滬者免領護照，數景亦不限制。這一點對於搬入米穀給予充分自由，論理興誘致迷米入口應有相當力量，可是「非法武裝團體依然限制運米」之事實，必須先動劇除，否則仍然無濟於事。</p>
<p>再者，今天報載市政諮詢委員會生活必需品小組委員會，對於政府公佈京滬民食米臨時措置網要以後，該會邀集會外專家共同商討，作成建議意見，足以提供當局參考。我們竭誠期待，規訂米糧搬入口管理辦法之時，充分傳採各方面輿論與囊意免，以朋適應現實囊境。</p>

<h3>松平部長說明英美間矛盾陸海外定例記者會見</h3>
<p>上海日陸·海·外三常局報道例會，昨日下午三時，候座　中飯店派樓，招待中國記者團，出席者有日大使館上海事務所松平悄報謬長，福間哪　領事及各報記者等，席間由松平部長發表談話，設明英。美關係最近之矛盾如後：</p>
<p>日前英首相邱吉。爾發表談話，其中有英對於中立國態皮之申明，尤其對於西班牙·瑞典·土耳其等國。邱吉爾此項談話，引起美國方面之反感，紐約時報）祈文稱：「邱吉爾向之中立國，應對　取停止</p>
<p>英·美一于國對中立國之　　矛盾，據本人觀測，其原因</p>
<p>第一　為英國處歐洲，對中立國聯　極深，如土耳其·西班牙等，較美國關係為深，因此邱吉爾不得不考　中立國之地位。至於美國，除南美洲有中立國阿根廷外，不必顯當中立國之立塲。</p>
<p>第二　英國領土及殖民地散於各處，而地民地常有脫離英帝國之傾向，所以英帝國會議中，邱吉爾有團結全領土之宣言，其殖民地與本國之間，尚有中立國　離。為使本土與殖民地加緊團結，不得不考慮中立國之立塲，然美國因環境地秋關係，西不必頗慮。</p>
<p>第三　美國貸與英國武器，佔百分之五十九，供給蘇聯佔百分之三十，甚致其他各國之武器亦由美承造，現中立國若欲強化國防，不得不仰諾美國，如軍械煤汕等，因此，美國以資主及財主之地位，對中立國及小國更為蔑視。</p>
<p>第四　英國為維持某領土及殖民地之親狀而戰。美國乃為擴大其勢力範圍而戰，因英。美立場相異，引起矛盾後果，邱吉爾對中立國態度談話，引起英。美間矛盾，使為其不能融洽一致之一例，最重要者為最近發生之國防。</p>
<p>航空　制度問題，英國　民地散處各地，航空網可以分佈於木國領土之內，美國航空在此經齊增加生產，極男佈　航空網，除南美外，更於美國，非溯，阿拉伯，波斯，刊度航空機之開闢。英。美兩國對航空溺度之調整，已發卞磨擦，於數星期內折衝調整國防航空制度，結果仍勵失收。其次為</p>
<p>煤油　問題，關於伊朋之煤礦，原　祕英國資木，近以美砌資木之僻入，控制波斯撇一礦，尤其美海軍把持甚力，引起英方反對美國之煤汕政策，由此可知英。美利售衝突之點極多，雙方利害既不能一致，再加以國民性之相異，所謂英·美軍隊侵歐作戰，即為共同作戰，宣傳愈烈，則面動愈緩，其原因即為其矛盾關係之存在</p>
<h3>黨訓團學員畢業考試</h3>

<h3>哥希馬砲戰劇烈豪雨中亦未稍止　日軍擊退敵反攻確保陣地</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電印度前綫電：敵軍企圖打開哥西馬之反攻作戰，雖在連日豪雨中，仍未稍止，在不分晝夜之砲擊戰下，敵軍不避一切損害執拗反攻，如二十五·六兩日，落於日軍陣地之大小砲彈，一日中竟達六萬發之多。日軍在敵軍瘋狂之反攻下，仍安全確保現在陣地，對接近之敵已予殲滅，截至二十三日止，該方面判明追加戰果如次：敵棄屍二九六具，鹵獲戰車一輛，機槍十二，自動步十一，步槍四二，無綫電一及各種彈藥七七三發。</p>
<p>仰光二日中央社電敵軍欲打通哥希馬，伊姆法爾公路，最近反攻哥希馬之情勢益趨激烈，然每當彼等進攻日軍陣地時，威蒙重創敗走。二十七日復有敵軍約四百人，於戰車十餘輛掩護下，企圖進攻五一二〇高地之日軍陣地，結果被擊毀戰軍三輛，而向北方敗退。二十八日晨，敵軍則以七百之衆，於中型戰車十四輛，裝甲車六輛及喬特索曼北方敵砲一陣之掩護下，進攻阿泯茲拉西方高地之日軍陣地。激戰後，敵軍損失戰車一輛，死傷三百餘，棄輕重機槍，自動步槍甚夥，向西方潰走。按敵軍欲於雨季降臨前實行反攻，期有所收穫，故不惜以大量物力及人力實施反攻，然敵軍屢戰皆北，其對戰局進展之期待，恐亦將成為畫餅。茲僅將二十八日之戰果誌下：敵軍損失戰車二十餘輛，汽車。貨車八十餘輛，軍馬二百匹左右，此外，並遣棄武器彈藥甚夥。</p>
<p>仰光二日中央社電渝軍及美兵部隊，為奪回北緬要衝密芝那，並包抄日軍之後方陣地，曩曾與於該市附近降下之空挺部隊，布成協同戰綫，並以猛烈之炸器向密芝那市街進攻，而日軍精銳，當即果敢反擊，摧毀敵員半數以上。當敵向鐵路西方潰逃之際，日軍部隊急行進擊，另一部隊更猛攻敵機塲，急襲敵軍，覆滅其重砲陣地，敵到處遭受重創，迄二十七日所判明之主要戰果如次，敵棄屍一四五〇具以上，俘虜十名，自動步槍一一〇枝，輕機槍五挺，子彈多數。</p>
<h3>改善航運後　尚有留難情事　　盼當局澈底誥誡員警</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電國府富局為求更進一步，確立戰時遝輸體制，經與盟邦當局協議，於上月十五日起，正式改正船舶航行規程，將以前所有限制輸送物資，及輸送人員之規程，概梅撤廢，暫定三十噸以下之民船，可自由航行掦子江及內河，無須申請航行許可證。至三十噸以上之航船，如巳加入華中航船協會，或華中內河民船公會為會員者，則在揚子江及內河內，原則上亦無須領證。如欲航行沿海海岸一帶，則須向海軍方面請領許可證。領證手續亦經改訂，較前更為簡單。此舉對船舶旣可增多，輸送自更圓滑，物資流通自更可暢通，裨益國計民生，良非淺鮮。惟自實施以來，各地軍警及稽査人員，仍時有對卅噸以下之船舶航行，故意留難，及勒索情事，究其原因，不外　有少數不良軍警，及稽査人員，濫用職權，故意留難勒索。　一般軍警及稽査人員，對於修正後之華中方面一般船舶航行統制規程，未能深切瞭解。惟上項情形實違背當局改善　航運之善意，不僅破壞航行規程，更有碍物資之運輸，影響國計民生至深且鉅，亟盼當局重申前令，詳為曉議，使軍鄉及稽查人員，澈底明　改訂航行規程之內容，對不法軍警及稽査人員，則應澈底嚴懲，以維航運，而安民生。</p>
<h3>運河春修工程　次第完竣</h3>
<p>揚州二日中央社電運河各段春修工程，前經水利署派員來揚，會同此間運堤春修工程處及運工局，商討春修及夏防工作，擬訂詳細計劃，分別開工。關於春修工程，全運河分為江都·高郵·汝安·汜水·寶應·五汛·各縣均巳遵照預定計劃開工，茲悉江都·實應·氾水·三汛，現已呈報竣工。高郵·汝安·兩汛，亦將完工，俟各汛工程竣事中央即將派員前往騐收。</p>
<h3>日本年度　小麥豐收</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電　日本本年度麥之產量，於播種期間因雨水缺少及本年氣候較遲關係，預想本年度必較往年减收，但據最近實際調査，其悄勢已為好轉，其收穫量可確保二千五六百萬石，不但不曾减收，且較去年度收獲量之一千八百五十萬石，反增收四成。</p>
<h3>爭奪佛洛辛農　鏖戰進行中　義南德軍採彈性戰術</h3>
<p>柏林二日中央社電南義前綫大規模攻勢之焦點，在於阿爾巴尼山之南部，與東南部邊緣維拉特里區與迤東附近之區，對數量優越之敵步兵與坦克車隊展開極猛烈之戰事。維拉特里之東，敵經第七次之猛攻後，僅能滲過德軍之前方陣地，該區激戰仍在進行中。週三義境大規模攻勢之另一焦點，係在佛洛辛農區（Frosinone）與該市鎭之西，該處英美軍竟日向德軍陣地猛攻，於是德軍在晚間將其陣地向中部亞平寗山南坡撤退數公里。又阿爾巴尼山區海岸地區英軍之進攻，僅在阿地亞以北略有進展。德軍在　谷河上游與聖格羅河發源處之避離行動，仍照原定計劃進行。德軍後　在全區進行激烈之斷後戰，尤以佛洛辛農區為甚，德軍不但遭遇英軍第八軍之重壓，抑且須擊退美第五軍之非洲輔助軍；過去數日來該軍已通過里比尼山脈向北推進，其前　業已進抵佛洛辛　迤西。總觀全局，德軍在義戰綫實施彈性與牽制之戰術，故尙未自東綫或西歐抽調生力軍參戰，惟反軸心軍方面則巳已自海外調到大量援軍前來助戰。</p>
<h3>教皇呼籲</h3>
<p>梵蒂岡二日中央敎皇庇護期十二世向紅衣大主敎會」議致詞稱，任何人敢舉手反對羅馬城者，「神聖之正義」將認為「弒母」逆倫罪。</p>
<p>北義海面一度海戰</p>
<p>柏林二日中央社電德軍當局發表：五月三十一日晨德海軍輕艦艇隊，會於義大利列古里安海面，與英快速艇六艘展開海戰，德輕艦艇擊沉英艇一艘，並創傷其另外一艘。英快速艇雖發射數枚魚雷，但德艦艇毫無損失，此後更於巴斯的亞東南方面，與之交戰，英艇遂向西方遁逸。</p>
<h3>東綫德軍反區　打破沉寂　甫路蘇軍調動忙</h3>
<p>柏林二日中央社電德國新聞社訊：德軍於羅境雅賽以北所發動之攻勢，已將多日來東綫之沉寂打破，德軍最高當局顯然重視此次之作戰，蓋以其與爭奪重要山脊有關也。蘇重仍　續以兵力及戰具集中於南路，蘇軍當局顯欲於轟斯特下游渡河西向，同時並由塞勒特河中游向南發動攻勢，以期擊破德羅聯軍之最右翼。尙有强大之蘇軍一股，正待命由泰諾波爾。勃羅第進攻勒伏甫。北路蘇軍正向威特勃斯克。庇斯哥夫及那爾瓦區集中數師團之來復槍部隊及摩托化部隊。</p>
<h3>保加利亞組成　親德內閣</h3>
<p>索菲亞二日中央社電　海通社訊：保加利亞攝政會議週四接受巴伊洛夫內閣之辭職，並立即授權前農長巴格亞諾夫組織新閣，數小時後，巴格亞諾夫特新閣員名單提交攝政會議，業經該會接受，其名單如下：總理巴格亞諾夫暫兼外交，內長卡特尼希夫，國防長魯史葉夫中將（連任），財長　伏夫，農長柯斯托夫教授，貿易檢長代斯萊夫，教長阿瑙社夫教授，賋長柯爾契夫，暫兼公共工程與建設，司法長魯塞夫。按新首相巴格亞諾夫，乃親德人物，且於農民會中聲望頗重。氏係一八九二年生於索菲亞，士官學校畢業後，參加巴爾幹戰爭，第一次大戰時任砲兵中隊長，其後並任國王鮑利斯三世之侍從武官，一九二五年升任上校，旋即退職，一九三七年當選國會議員，一九四一年二月再度隱居以迄今日。</p>
<h3>哈里曼　抵莫斯科</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：美國駐蘇大使哈里曼與美商會長約翰斯登，已於昨日抵達莫斯科，約翰斯登將在蘇逗留三星期，參觀各生產中心。</p>
<h3>被捕美機員　德處以極刑</h3>
<p>沮利克二日中央社電　據瑞士日報柏林電：德政府對美機駕駛員處以極刑事，已予確認，並謂美轟炸戰術，乃歐戰開始以來所未見者，故引起國民間之憤激。</p>
<p>羅國境內擊落美機柏日中央社電　德軍當局一日聲稱，美機隊會於三十一日轟炸羅馬尼亞。被德羅空軍及高射砲隊擊落二十八架。</p>
<h3>招考新生訓練　海軍海運人才　中央海校姜校長談話</h3>
<p>中央海軍學校姜校長西園及該校首席輔導官森少將等，昨日參加上海日本艦隊報道部會見記者例會，席間由姜校長向記者闡釋量近海軍部招考情形，略誌如后：海軍部在六七兩月，舉行第六期中央海軍學校學生及第一期中央高等商船學校學生招考，規定在南京上海蘇州北京天津靑島威海衛漢口廣州同時招考新生，上海及蘇州兩地報名由中央海軍學校辦理。在大東亞觀爭中，感覺海運與海軍不能分離，而後方民生必需品的價格高貴，一方面固然是主要原因。所以，海軍以外，海運同樣重要。商船學校就是培養海運人才的塲所。這次商船學校第一期招生，尤為重要，因為第一期畢業生將來都是領導商船者，所以，對於學生的素質，必須嚴格選擇，希望優秀靑年踴躍參加考試，為中國海運服務，奠植海運始基。盟邦對於海軍海運學生，八學考試頗為嚴格，素質優良，所以蔚成今日優秀的海軍。値得我們注意的，旋由森少將發揮海軍的精神，實較物質為重耍之意義，海軍精神，就是人才優秀就需要優良的敎育。美國海軍精神低劣，縱已具備物質條件，徒然無用，於此益見海軍人才培養之重要。</p>
<h3>松島部長談　華萊士赴渝　並說明太平洋戰局</h3>
<p>日駐艦隊報道部於昨（二日）日循例會見上海中國親聞記者時，由松島報道部長就太平洋戰局及華萊士訪渝情形發表談話，並介紹中央海軍學校姜校長與記者晤見，茲誌松島部長談話如次：</p>
<p>今天介紹中央海軍學校姜校長與各位會見，仍照過去情形先對戰局加以說明，然後再由姜校長對中央海軍學校及中央高等商船學校招考學生情形對各位報吿。</p>
<p>華萊士赴重度目的　此次美副　統華萊士，當羅斯福尙未當選通任總統以前，經西伯利亞遠道訪渝，對軍事政治外交種種方面，自頗引起世界之注意。關於業氏訪渝的用意和目的，各方論調頗多，簡言之約有下列數端：（甲）當前渝方在軍事經濟各方面之困難問題，如何解決，尤其在河南作戰以後，渝方困難日益增加，軍需物資與經濟壓迫，尤為目前量嚴重間題。在過去情形，渝方對英美援助，非常急迫需要，但事實上僅賴航空路綫的援助，尙不逮所希望萬分之一。（乙）其次關於國際問題，背後尙有對於蘇聯之關係，此點關係渝方政權將來命運，頗為重要。　於太平洋戰局之實際情形，與敵方所宣傳者正相反，實際敵方活動很少，敵企圖到達中國大陸已不可能，假定可能到違時，則中國人民所受之痛苦，較目前更甚。根據以上所述情形，華萊士餝渝目的，無非在詞整渝政　，使渝方命販振作起來</p>
<p>重度暴露依賴劣性</p>
<p>渝方在華萊士未到達前，在極秘密中召集十二中全會，已於五月二十六日閉幕。關於十二中全會之議決案，如實施憲政，調整物價等，發表者正多，其最重要而使吾人注意者，為渝宣佈反抗軸心國到底。據五月二十五日路透電英外相發表談話，對渝作戰八年極為讚揚，但英國對渝援助甚少，此不啻暴露英國無能力。根據十二中全會之結果，今後仍希望英美援助大量物資，此可暴露渝方之依賴性，並且損失中國之體面，渝政權指導者之無獨立自主精神可以想見。故於華氏未到渝前不得不舉行十二中全會，由此可知渝方之困難重重矣。</p>
<p>走進內綫必遭痛擊</p>
<p>關於現在太平洋之戰况，自美軍在新幾內亞必阿克島登陸以來，日方在海陸軍聯合作戰之下，繼績對敵擴大殘減戰，除必阿克島一部份敵人外，其餘逐漸被日軍消滅，當然必阿克島在戰略上說，亦為重要地帶，假如敵方在此作根據，日軍在菲律賓及荷印一帶，亦不無影響。但從另一方面說，敵人正走進日軍內錢，定受日軍猛烈攻擊無疑，敵軍前進，已照日方預定之點與綫，也就是照日方所希望的地方來了，日軍早有備，定予敵以殲滅之打</p>
<p>三角海面敵軍墓塲</p>
<p>由臺灣起到新加坡以至必阿克島形成一三角形勢貼紙海面可稱謂亞細亞的地中海。英美在大東亞戰爭開始，即想保持此亞細亞之地中海，坆在香港新加坡等處在大東亞戰爭以閃，即策極建筑東要防緊設備，英美所想的三角形與日方所想的面積雖不同，意義則一致。英美固重視此亞細亞之地中海，日本亦然，今後此三角地帶之爭奪戰，一定非黨激烈。上次東條首相發表宣言曾謂日本不久將從守勢轉向攻勢，此種攻守移轉之具體情形自不便宣露，或許於亞細亞地中海之分奪戰中可以表現一斑。</p>
<p>美新海長是門外漢</p>
<p>自五月下旬在此方殘減戰積極進行以後，據美海軍長官佛列斯托所發表之談話，可見敵方步驟已亂，其談話內容與諾克斯所發表者顯然不同，頗多矛盾，證明是門外漢，敵方以此種指導者作戰，將來結果可想而知，佛列斯托謂美海軍海艦生產大增，但與六月一日路易斯，所發表者適得其反，彼此衝突矛盾，可見一斑，美大總統秘書斯蒂芬，會見記者稱，據德國宣稱　炸德國被擊　洛之美機師，隨時隨地可被德國人民擊斃，此種宣傳完全不確云云，由此可知美國飛行人員之怕死，而予以安慰。而日方與敵美則完全不同。據日本航空本部長塚原曾稱，日航空機生產量正大見進步，第一綫所用的飛機，不久即可超過敵方數倍。此外在造船生產亦大量增加，日方為完成戰略目的一天比一天突飛猛晋。</p>
<p>日軍作戰注意兩點</p>
<p>今後將從兩點上注意，　將英美攻擊部隊在海上擊滅。　增强輸送力，使戰力增强愈為進步。日方在努力擊滅敵人的戰局上，鑒於在中國大陸對大東亞戰爭的重要性，希望中國海軍及海運均有長足的進步，吾人對此極為期待。回憶一八九〇年中國海軍及水警在世界上所佔之地位，倘能照此發展下去，和日本的海軍海運聯合起來，定有極强大的力量。木人希望中國海軍特別發達，中國海運特別進展，對大東亞戰爭極有裨益。縱有一百個華萊士訪渝，亦殊不値吾人之注意。茲特介紹中央海軍學校姜校長與諸位談話。</p>

<p>本巿黑巿米價進日激增，影響民食匪淺，市府為過止漲風，安定民，除採取必要措置外，特頭發佈告，預料經此措置後，本市民食問題可望好轉。茲照錄二佈吿原文如次：</p>

<p>令米業成立採辦組　（佈告二）為佈告事：茲根據巿民食米管理暫行辦法第二條「為執行辦法起見，由市府飭令巳登記之米店，按照行政區分別成立採辦組，每組設組長一人，由配給戶口米機關指定之」之規定，本巿已登記之各米店，應迅即召開同業會　，依照本巿各行政區內米店分佈狀沉，分別成立採辦組，其組長人選，先由該同業推選三人至五人，呈請本府糧食局及第一區公署經濟處一會同核定，至於採辦米糧所需資金，依據前項管理暫行辦法第十三條之規定，原則上概由採辦商及米店自行準備，但為獎勵民食米之充分輸人及體恤商艱起見，倘確有資力不足者，得呈請本府轉商銀行，酌予貸款仰各米商一體遵照，合亟佈吿週知，此佈。</p>
<h3>收繭貸款　續借一萬萬元　將與銀團簽訂合同</h3>
<p>絲綢業同業聯合會各會員絲廠公司等，為收買春雨，前曾與中交等十五家銀行合組之貸款銀團。成立五萬萬元借款，旋以借款數字不數分配，遂繼續向該團借款一萬萬元，經磋商結果，決定由銀團中之交通，上海，國華，華興，建興，上海工商，大康等七家銀行承借，該項借該仍以承兌匯票方式行之，中央儲備銀行承認重貼現，聞日內即將簽定借款合同。</p>
<h3>日用品存貨登記　展期七天</h3>

<h3>商號開具發票　須粘貼印花</h3>
<p>江蘇省印花於酒稅局，為推進印花稅收，便利商民購貼起見，除飭由各業同業公會推銷各會員商號依法購貼外，現特籌劃核准四十家合格烟兌店代售印花稅票。茲悉該局近査多數公司商號門巿，售出貨物，每不開給發票，企圖逃避粘貼印花稅票，似此情形，影響稅收甚鉅，為特通令各業同業公會，勸吿各會員商號遵照，凡門巿售出貨物價款，務須開具發票，並依法粘貼印花，以維國稅。</p>
<h3>三輸車禁裝　怪聲響音器</h3>
<p>本巿第一發察局，因鑒邇來一般三輪車及自由車所裝置之　音器，頗多有違定章，或竟發作怪音，注意裝置，旣足擾亂公衆，日增喧囂。更有發生危險之虞，故經重行規定，凡屬三輪車及自由車。無論其為自用或營業。除必須應行裝置於　鈴一具外，其他任何　音器一概不得使用，是項手撳鈴並應裝置於車輛把手上近握手之處，不得裝置於車輪上，如有違反，當予從戰懲處。</p>

<h3>食米臨時措置綱要　建議加以補充　諮詢委員會提請當局採納</h3>
<p>自行政院發表京滬兩市民食米臨時措置綱要後，上海特別巿巿政諮詢委充之處，幷有釐訂施行細則之必要，曾擬就建議書，提請市政當局，請於會周米統會及有關各方商定細則時，盡量採納，茲錄誌該項建議原則如次：</p>
<p>綱要第一條「本綱要在統制原則下為充裕兩市之食米規定之」，本條所謂充裕兩巿之食米，完全根據統制原則辦理，甚為合理，故施行方面各種細則，亦須根據統制原則及精神推行之，免致反響</p>
<p>綱要第二條「凡米統會核准之採辦商及京滬兩市已登記之米店，及附近農民，將自己收穫之米穀　運至巿區內售銷。均得向米統會申請搬運米穀護照，但米統會按照成數微購軍警及重要產黨項用米，其徵購成數規定如左：（乙）採辦商未繳淸原單或新加入者，徵購百分之成數亦分為三種，似乎未能一元化，且辦理時亦易有流弊，預料參加之採辦商，雖不是已經兩地之交淸原訂成單者，亦將借名頂替，以圖徴購成數之减少，是以採辦商之種類及徵購成數，以一元化為是，査上海方面米行向米統會申請為採辦商者，不及十分之一，為今之計，似應將以前米糧公會會員現　經營雜辦業務者，恢復其原有採辦商地位，依照米統會所訂辦法，繼續營業，以資駕輕就熟，尙有農民將自己收獲之米穀一，運至市內銷售，如在石以內者，似可免請護照，及不徵軍警米，因在米開放時，農民亦可移入三五斗至巿銷售，現已開放時，似不能使農民反受限制。</p>
<p>綱要第三條「徵購米般之收買價格，除第一條乙項另有規定者外，按照實際成本附加合法利潤隨時規定之」。本條所謂實際成本，目前情形複雜殊難計算，欲求「實際成本」成為實際，非將產銷兩地的運輸及費用，使有把握。據最近調查　販商多由蕪裝船駁運至京，再裝火車，</p>
<p>費用不在少數，而　虧損失，尙不在內。費用尤大。　近來鐵道運檢情形之下（不負實際）走漏缺少之事在所不免，雖可雇人押運，然其效力亦微，故每車虧耗至少須百分之十。　裝卸兩地之主管人員難保無留難情事，　由水運則地多荊棘，難獲保障，而各地區有關機關復多需索。上述各種意外費用，如不能解決，則成本無從計算，價格亦難以統制，絕反違反統制原則，補救辦法，祗須顧及最要之兩點：　陸運裝車須首先商請中鐵道公司改善制度，（制度改善後所增添之人員其費用可由米統會酌予補貼或增加運費）同時並請鐵道　局於軍需外，以民食為　，設法增添車輛，儘先裝運。</p>
<p>水運裝船由裝卸兩地撥派軍警，組織護運隊隊員重質不重量，並須隨時抽調以免日久滋弊，深信護運隊如能辦理完善，各地機關均可予以協助，沿途搶刦勒之事，自可消滅，意外之損失免除，然後方能計算實際成本，再定合法利潤。</p>
<p>綱要第四條「凡運往京滬兩巿之米糧，除應由米統會微購者外，其餘部份得以自由價格買賣之，但為防止囤積及暴利，其實範圍，由巿政府會同米統會勞訂之。」本條所謂其餘部份之戰賣，其價格得由米統會根據成本及利潤，加以審定，但其賣買行為，仍應按照本綱要第一條規定，在統制原則下推行之，即米行糧商轉向內地採辦依照米統會所定價格售與米統會，由米統會分配各米店，再憑現行制度戶口配給票出售人民，如是則採辦商及米店均不能有所國積操縱，至米統會一米款項，如另向銀行接治，未免多費周章，不如由米統會商　中央信託局墊款購米，（按該局業務原有墊代購之規定）好在米統會在一轉瞬之間，即可向米店取值還款，則墊款問題，並不重要，內地米價各地成本不同，必須由米統會會同當地縣府及縣商會農會，按照成本再加合法利潤規定之，不得自由抬價，以符統制原則。</p>
<p>綱要第五條「茍無米統會護照而搬入米教時，以私米論，按服中央法令懲處之」。苞無米統會謹照而搬入米殺時，以私即為私米，但綱要第六條米統會在一京滬兩巿指定搬入口設臨時頒發護照處，並得隨時對未經請領護照之米商，給予搬運體照一，似指定米商事前並未領得米統會之鐵照，而將米穀運至搬入口時，亦可在臨時頒發護照處補領護照，搬入巿內，並不以私米論，條文似有抵觸或需請整之處。</p>
<p>綱要第七條「上述護照統由米統會按照原頒申請要給米穀採辦證及米免除任何費用，以免流弊，其頒發地點須由米統會事前公布，護照上面應註明請領日期及發給日期，規定幾夭辦不得過期，並不收任何費用等字樣，俾資遵守，並須負責者簽名蓋章，其頒發手續務以最迅捷之方法行之。</p>
<p>再米商運米至上海，無論水陸兩路，應由米統會指定週當碼頭與倉庫，並限定在某一限期內，必須按巿與米統會辦理交割，否則由米統會予以處分。尙有重要三點附列於後</p>
<p>米統會對糧商採辦前，必須加以有計劃之組織，以便分區分組依法辦理，不得自由競爭，以符統制原則。</p>
<p>巿政府與米統會若已決定對農民運米至兩巿，其數量在一石以內，准其免領搬運護照及不征軍米者，應請即日明令公布。因近日人心惶惑，認為政府發表食米臨時措置綱要，實為加緊統制，而農民自己收穫之米殺，亦不得搬運至巿區內銷售，故雖有少數運到，即為居民爭購一空，同時售者又復乘機抬價，其價遂急遽高漲，情勢備極嚴重，故望密切注意，迅將辦法明白公布，以息浮音，而遏漲風。　　　　　辦任何事業，其最關重要者為人事問題，辦理民食為尤甚，若有新辦法而環境依然，自必難收實效，督促訪査，似不可少，可否出市政府會同米統會組織盤察委員會，聘任德望隆重之人士，擔任委員，隨時加以觀察及糾正。</p>

<p>今天是六三紀念節，是紀意一百餘年前（公元一八三九年即前淸道光十九年）兩廣總督林則徐先生在廣東焚燬烟土的故事。記得林則徐先生向淸廷上疏痛陳鴉片的害處很多而且很厲害。原文中曾說過。「烟不禁絕，國日貧，民日弱，十餘年後，豈惟無可籌之餉，抑且無可用之兵。」寥寥數語，何等沈痛。何等確切林先生以先知先覺的許再販烟土到中國。這未始非中國光榮史的一頁。不過英國自持兵力强大，和我國開仗，道就是歷史上所稱的「鴉片戰爭」。戰爭的結果，我國因亟治腐敗上下不能一致而告失敗，在公元一八四二年訂立了江寗條約—不平等條約。將香港割讓，開上起侵略，援例訂立不平等條約，轉成了百餘年來的一面傷心史。淸季末葉的數卞年中，毒氣蔓延全國，官民公然吸食鴉片，負了東亞病夫的頭銜，被世界各國所輕視，雖然烟土的侵入，是英人心懷巨測，不過烟土的流行，實是國人咎由自取，當時敎育很幼雅，政治很腐敗，政府熟視無暗的放任，人民如醉如夢的嗜吸。所以政治未澄淸，根本談不到禁烟，敎育未普及，根本談不到戒吸。淸末的禁烟，雖有其名，要無其實。鼎革以來，英美挑撥離間的手段，層出不窮，國內戰亂未已，烟禁忽張忽弛，民國七八年間北京政府辦理烟禁，收買外商存土，特派司法次長張一鵬氏到上海監視焚燬。計有大土一千零十三箱，小土一百九十四箱，當時政府表示決心，中外同聲嘆服，這也是禁烟史上有價値的一頁，十六年國府奠都南京，特定六月三日為禁烟紀念日，二十四年四月，我主席在行政院長任內奉行國父拒　　調，頒布五年禁絕法令，於是禁吸，禁售，禁運，禁種，同時實施。無如因不平等條約尙木取消，外交上的難關，無法打破，半途又遇到八一三事變發生，烟禁遂又鬆弛，前功盡棄。英人又復利用機會，傾銷烟土，以香港為儲藏庫，以上海為策源地，完遂他一貫的經濟侵略和毒害人民的陰謀。幸而「大東亞戰爭」爆發，英人潰退，香港，上海及各地租界，相繼收還，不平等條約也取消。策源地和儲藏庫都不能存在，倘然百餘年來所受鴉片的毒害不再乘這時機根本剷除，那麼汚點何時能够永遠洗滌？奇恥何時能够完全洗雲呢？我主席有鑒於此，決定於本年三月間重申前令，繼續施行禁政，自本年三月三十日起至三十六年三月二十九日止為完全禁絕期間。本年四月一日內政部禁烟總局成立，是在租界收回，方及半年的時候；地點又和「鴉片戰爭」歷史有關的上海。今天又是上海市區內開始辦理烟民登記的日期，因種種的關係，發生了很多的感觸。所以要和同胞們說幾句話。本人所要說的是什麽幾句話呢？就是同胞們第一應當知道：中國的弱，是由於鴉片，因為人民吸了雅片，精神萎靡，任何事業，不肯努力去做。第二應當知道；中國的中國國富民强，必定要禁絕雅片。第四，希望同胞們互相喚起同胞們，從今大禁烟紀念節起，趕快的覺悟，有雅片烟癮的同胞趕快的自動去戒除，以後不要再吸。沒有吸食雅片的同胞切勿染上這種惡劣的嗜好。務使雅片的餘毒，在禁絕期間以後，我國境內不再存留，不再滋生。這是本人今日所希望和禱祝的。</p>

<h3>提倡敬老運動　擬以六月六日為敬老節</h3>
<p>我國每年四月四日，定售兒童節，對於「慈幼」「福幼」工作，已引起國人的重視，獨於敬老運動應有的紀念，則猶無人提倡，愛提議六月六日，定為「敬老節」，以達到「幼吾幼以及人之幼」「老吾老以及人之老」的意義，因為「慈幼」和「敬老」，同為吾人應做的重要工作。「敬老節」的目的，為感謝老人以往的辛勞，給老年人精神上安　，或物質上的援助，使他們得享快樂的生活。故於是日，應舉行敬老慶祝會，座談會，聚餐會，茶話會，或組織慰問老人團，提倡老人健康運動，救濟貧病老人，設立安老院。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>紀念六三</h3>
<p>今天是六三紀念，當一百零五年前的今天，林文忠公虎門焚土之舉，堅數激昻，使英人落魄。今天我們追念先烈，首先對於大無畏之精神，表示崇敬而應取法。其次對於禁烟決心，表示仰　而應堅持。鴉片之禍害中國，其毒最甚，百餘年來，使我民放健康從而斷傷，民族意志從而消沉。使中華民族處於半殖民地的地位，鴉片遺毒實為厲階。我們痛定思痛，對於敵人英國之亡人手段，切齒難忘。况因林公禁烟之舉，為針對英人毒害陰謀之有效排斥，引起鴉片戰爭，而開締結不平等條約之端，毒害遂成不可收拾之蔓延。我們痛定思痛，對於敵人英國之侵略手段，尤其切齒難忘。自從大東亞戰爭後，英美勢力驅除，去年更得盟邦日本之助，收回租界，逐漸廢除不平等條約，解除百年來之桎梏。可是開不平等條約之端的鴉片毒害，雖經　再禁令，仍未絕跡，今日我們紀念林公禁烟往事，歷百餘年而烟毒依然，能不愧怍！然而愧作於事實無補，惟有取法先烈的大無畏精神，堅持先烈的禁烟決心，澈底禁絕鴉片，才能對得住先烈。今年二月間政府通通三年禁烟辦法，規定自今年三月三十日起至三十六年三月二十九日止，三年之內逐漸禁絕。我們希望依此期限，切實做到，湔雪百年之前的恥辱。</p>

<h3>Maintaining Calm</h3>
<p>These past few days, rice prices in the black market have entered a lightning-like state. Because rice is a necessity tied to the lives of the masses, the public's anxiety over this lightning rice price is naturally human nature. However, anxiety is anxiety, lightning is lightning. The fact of the lightning will not be lessened by anxiety. At the same time, after anxiety, there will inevitably be panic and disappointment, giving unscrupulous people opportunities to stir up trouble, merely fueling the arrogance of the lightning and not helping the matter. Therefore, rather than being anxious without practical benefit, it is better to remain calm and closely watch the measures of the municipal authorities and Allied authorities. We believe that the municipal authorities and Allied authorities have the determination to adjust the rice and grain issue, and this determination is based on the demands of the people. However, in the implementation and measures, the municipal authorities cannot decide alone, thus causing some unforeseen twists and turns. Regarding the fluctuations in our city, no matter what their origin, the authorities should quickly remedy them, not engage in empty words, but use facts to stabilize people's hearts. On the other hand, we hope that citizens will remain calm and not panic, so as not to increase the difficulties in handling the situation for the authorities. Yesterday's editorial in the News Daily News economic section put forward essential opinions. The Mainland New Daily analyzed the reasons for the rice price fluctuations, and we agree with the following points:</p>
<p>Rice prices soared because the relevant authorities took action too late.</p>
<p>Without waiting for the specific details to be fully prepared, they suddenly announced a major change of policy, so the initiative in rice prices was faster for rice hoarders than for the Rice Control Association and the municipal government.</p>
<p>It is difficult to declare the abolition of restrictions on rice, but the illegal armed groups still restrict the transportation of rice.</p>
<p>Even if passports are issued immediately and merchants purchase rice and transport it to Shanghai, it will still take considerable time and cannot increase the amount of rice brought in in the short term.</p>
<p>Mainland rice merchants predict that after the free transportation of rice to Shanghai, the market price will definitely be high, and most are unwilling to transport rice to Shanghai, but instead hoard it.</p>
<p>The result of this policy change regarding rice is that the purchasing activities of the Rice Control Association and designated merchants in various offices in the areas surrounding Shanghai have all entered a state of stagnation.</p>
<p>As usual, the months of June, July, August, and September are the lean season, and rice prices should be expensive. At the same time, we must supplement that Chongqing secret service personnel are taking the opportunity to stir up trouble, deliberately shouting high prices, pretending to buy, creating a semblance of a market with goods, on the one hand to achieve the goal of disturbing people's hearts, on the other hand to be able to report back to Chongqing. This is something that cannot be ignored. Secondly, unscrupulous merchants collude with each other, manipulate the black market, and attempt to make huge profits. Now the municipal authorities have announced that before the "Management Measures for Rice and Grain Moving into This City" are promulgated, various purchasers and nearby farmers transporting rice to Shanghai are exempt from passport requirements, and the number of shipments is not restricted. This point gives full freedom to the import of rice grains. In theory, it should have considerable power to attract rice imports, but the fact that "illegal armed groups still restrict the transportation of rice" must first be thoroughly eliminated, otherwise it will still be of no avail.</p>
<p>Furthermore, today's newspaper reports that the Municipal Consultative Committee's Subcommittee on Daily Necessities, after the government announced the "Temporary Measures Outline for People's Food Rice in Beijing and Shanghai," invited outside experts to jointly discuss and formulate suggestions for the authorities to refer to. We sincerely hope that when stipulating the "Management Measures for Rice and Grain Moving into This City," full consideration will be given to opinions and suggestions from all parties in order to adapt to the reality of the situation.</p>
<h3>Field Marshal Hata Honored for Great Achievements; Emperor Bestows Title of Marshal as Special Favor; Army Ministry Officially Announced Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army Ministry announced on June 2nd: Field Marshal General Hata Shunroku, Third Rank of the Senior Grade, Second Order of Merit, First Class, is listed in the Marshal's Office, and is specially granted the title of Marshal.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - His Majesty the Emperor of Japan commended General Hata Shunroku, Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army, for his many years of martial achievements. On the 2nd, he specially bestowed upon him the title of Marshal and listed him in the Marshal's Office. General Hata Shunroku has held important positions in the central military and political organs and has served as the commander of internal and external forces and the commander of armies. In February of Showa 13 (1938), he was appointed commander of the Central China Expeditionary Army and personally went to the front lines. In May of the 14th year, he was appointed Chamberlain Chief Aide-de-Camp, and in the same month, he was appointed Minister of the Army, and then became a military councillor. In March of the 16th year, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army until today. The general has held important military and political command positions for many years, devoting all his intelligence and energy, and has repeatedly made great achievements. Therefore, this time, His Majesty the Emperor commended his great achievements, listing his name in the Marshal's Office, the highest position for a military man, and specially bestowed the title of Marshal. The current Marshals in Japan are Prince Kan'in Kotohito, Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu, Prince Nashimoto Morimasa, and Nagano Osami, Terauchi Hisaichi, and Sugiyama Gen, who were listed in the Marshal's Office last June. With the addition of Marshal Hata this time, the Marshal's Office becomes even more prestigious. Now that the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, the Japanese army, with its majestic and resolute combat power, is seizing this good opportunity to reduce the enemy and is moving towards a tight-knit stage of re-expanding its offensive. In particular, the China Expeditionary Army, in the vast land and air of China, has launched a fierce and dominant offensive. While crushing the fighting power of the Chongqing side, it has also dealt a heavy blow to the strategic plans of the U.S. military on the mainland. At this time, the expansion of the Marshal's Office, the supreme organ of military affairs, is of profound significance. In the future, the activities of the China Expeditionary Army under the command of Commander-in-Chief Marshal Hata will be noteworthy.</p>

<h3>Minister Matsudaira Explains Contradictions Between Britain and the United States; Routine Press Conference of Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>Shanghai, Japanese Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs Bureau held a routine press conference at the Zhongfan Hotel yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., inviting the Chinese press corps. Those who attended included Minister Matsudaira of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, Consul Fukuma, and reporters from various newspapers. During the conference, Minister Matsudaira delivered a speech explaining the recent contradictions between Britain and the United States as follows:</p>
<p>Recently, British Prime Minister Churchill made a statement in which he stated Britain's position on neutral countries, especially Spain, Sweden, and Turkey. Churchill's statement aroused resentment from the United States. The New York Times criticized: "Churchill should stop taking a lenient attitude towards neutral countries."</p>
<p>The causes of the contradictions between Britain and the United States regarding neutral countries, according to my observation, are as follows:</p>
<p>First, Britain is located in Europe and has deep ties with neutral countries such as Turkey and Spain, which are deeper than those of the United States. Therefore, Churchill has to consider the status of neutral countries. As for the United States, except for Argentina, a neutral country in South America, it does not need to express its position on neutral countries.</p>
<p>Second, Britain's territory and colonies are scattered everywhere, and the colonies often tend to secede from the British Empire. Therefore, Churchill declared the unity of all territories in the Imperial Conference. There are neutral countries separating its colonies from the mainland. In order to strengthen the unity between the mainland and the colonies, it is necessary to consider the position of neutral countries, but the United States does not need to worry about it due to its environmental and geographical relations.</p>
<p>Third, the United States lends 59 percent of its weapons to Britain and 30 percent to the Soviet Union. Even weapons for other countries are manufactured by the United States. If neutral countries want to strengthen their national defense, they have to rely on the United States for military equipment, coal, oil, etc. Therefore, the United States, as a creditor and financier, is even more contemptuous of neutral countries and small countries.</p>
<p>Fourth, Britain is fighting to maintain the status quo of its territory and colonies. The United States is fighting to expand its sphere of influence. Because the positions of Britain and the United States are different, the consequences of the contradictions arise. Churchill's statement on the attitude towards neutral countries is one example of the incompatibility between Britain and the United States. The most important is the recently occurring national defense.</p>
<p>Aviation system issue, Britain's colonies are scattered everywhere, and the aviation network can be distributed within the territory of the country. American aviation has increased production in this industry, which is extremely difficult to distribute the aviation network. In addition to South America, there are also the United States, North Africa, Arabia, Persia, and India to open up aviation. The adjustment of aviation standards between Britain and the United States has already generated friction. The defense aviation system was adjusted and adjusted within a few weeks, but the results were still unsuccessful. Secondly, there is the</p>
<p>Oil issue, Regarding the oil mines in Iran, the original was British capital. Recently, with the entry of American capital, it controlled the Persian oil mine, especially the US Navy, which has a strong hold, arousing British opposition to the US oil policy. From this, it can be seen that there are many points of conflict between British and American interests. Since the interests of the two sides cannot be consistent, coupled with the difference in national character, the so-called joint operations of the British and American forces in Europe, the more intense the publicity, the slower the movement, the reason is the existence of its contradictory relationship.</p>

<h3>Intense Artillery Battles in Kohima Continue Even in Heavy Rain; Japanese Army Repels Enemy Counterattack and Secures Positions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - Dispatch from the Indian Front: The enemy army's attempt to launch a counterattack to break through Kohima has not stopped despite the continuous heavy rain. Under the incessant artillery battles day and night, the enemy army stubbornly counterattacks regardless of all damage. For example, on the 25th and 26th, the number of artillery shells, both large and small, falling on the Japanese army's positions reached as many as 60,000 in one day. The Japanese army safely maintains its current positions despite the enemy army's frantic counterattacks, and has annihilated the approaching enemy. As of the 23rd, the additional results confirmed in this area are as follows: 296 enemy bodies were abandoned, 1 tank, 12 machine guns, 11 automatic rifles, 42 rifles, 1 radio, and 773 rounds of various ammunition were seized.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The enemy army wants to open the Kohima-Imphal highway, and the situation of the recent counterattack on Kohima has become increasingly fierce. However, whenever they attack the Japanese army's positions, they are heavily damaged and defeated. On the 27th, about 400 enemy soldiers, under the cover of more than 10 tanks, attempted to attack the Japanese army's positions at Hill 5120, but were destroyed by three tanks and retreated to the north. On the morning of the 28th, the enemy army, with a force of 700, under the cover of 14 medium tanks, 6 armored vehicles, and a barrage of enemy artillery from the north of Chaut Soma, attacked the Japanese army's positions on the heights west of Apinzla. After a fierce battle, the enemy army lost one tank, suffered more than 300 casualties, and abandoned a large number of light and heavy machine guns and automatic rifles, and retreated to the west. The enemy army wants to carry out a counterattack before the rainy season arrives, hoping to gain something. Therefore, they do not hesitate to implement a counterattack with a large amount of material and manpower. However, the enemy army has been defeated in many battles, and their expectations for the progress of the war situation may also become a pie in the sky. The results of the battle on the 28th are recorded as follows: The enemy army lost more than 20 tanks, more than 80 automobiles and trucks, and about 200 military horses. In addition, they abandoned a large number of weapons and ammunition.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army and the U.S. military, in order to recapture Myitkyina, a key point in northern Burma, and encircle the rear positions of the Japanese army, once formed a coordinated front with the airborne troops that had landed near the city, and launched a fierce bombing attack on the city of Myitkyina. The elite Japanese army immediately launched a bold counterattack, destroying more than half of the enemy personnel. When the enemy fled westward along the railway, the Japanese army units urgently advanced, and another unit attacked the enemy airfield, launching a surprise attack on the enemy army and destroying its heavy artillery positions. The enemy suffered heavy losses everywhere. The main results confirmed up to the 27th are as follows: More than 1,450 enemy bodies were abandoned, 10 prisoners were captured, 110 automatic rifles, 5 light machine guns, and a large number of bullets were seized.</p>
<h3>Even After Improving Shipping, There Are Still Difficulties; Hope the Authorities Thoroughly Reprimand the Police</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - In order to further establish a wartime transportation system, the National Government, after consultation with the Allied authorities, officially revised the ship navigation regulations on the 15th of last month, abolishing all previous regulations restricting the transportation of materials and personnel. It is temporarily stipulated that civilian ships under 30 tons can freely navigate the Yangtze River and inland rivers without applying for navigation permits. As for ships over 30 tons, if they have joined the China Shipping Association or the China Inland River Civilian Shipping Association as members, they generally do not need to obtain permits in the Yangtze River and inland rivers. If they want to navigate along the coast, they must apply to the Navy for a permit. The permit application procedures have also been revised to be simpler than before. This measure can increase the number of ships, smooth the transportation, and facilitate the flow of materials, which is of great benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, since the implementation, military police and inspectors in various places still often deliberately create difficulties and extort money from ships under 30 tons. The reasons are nothing more than: A few unscrupulous military police and inspectors abuse their power and deliberately create difficulties and extort money. The general military police and inspectors do not have a thorough understanding of the revised General Shipping Control Regulations for Civilian Ships in Central China. However, the above situation violates the authorities' good intentions to improve shipping, not only undermining the navigation regulations, but also hindering the transportation of materials, which has a profound and significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is hoped that the authorities will reiterate the previous order and explain in detail to the military police and inspectors the content of the revised navigation regulations. Unlawful military police and inspectors should be thoroughly punished to maintain shipping and ensure the people's livelihood.</p>

<h3>Japan's Annual Wheat Harvest</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The wheat production in Japan this year was expected to be reduced compared to previous years due to the lack of rain during the sowing period and the late climate this year. However, according to the latest actual survey, the situation has improved. The harvest volume can ensure 25.6 million koku. Not only has it not been reduced, but it has increased by 40% compared to last year's harvest volume of 18.5 million koku.</p>
<h3>The Struggle for Frosinone: A Fierce Battle Underway, German Forces in Southern Italy Adopt Elastic Tactics</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The focus of the large-scale offensive on the Southern Italian front lies south of the Alban Hills and in the southeastern edge of the Velletri area and its surrounding districts. Extremely fierce battles are being waged against enemy infantry and tank units of superior numbers. East of Velletri, after a seventh fierce assault, the enemy has only managed to penetrate the forward German positions; intense fighting continues in the area. Another focal point of the large-scale Italian offensive on Wednesday was in the Frosinone area and west of the town. There, British and American forces launched relentless attacks on German positions throughout the day, so the German forces retreated several kilometers at night to the southern slopes of the central Apennine Mountains. Furthermore, the British advance in the coastal area of the Alban Hills has made only slight progress north of Anzio. The German withdrawal operations from the upper valley of the Volturno River and the source of the Sangro River are proceeding according to the original plan. German rearguard action is intense throughout the region, especially in the Frosinone area, where German forces are not only under heavy pressure from the British Eighth Army but must also repel the African auxiliary forces of the U.S. Fifth Army. These forces have advanced northward through the Lepini Mountains in the past few days, and their vanguard has already reached west of Frosinone. Overall, German forces are implementing elastic and delaying tactics on the Italian front and have not yet withdrawn fresh troops from the Eastern Front or Western Europe to participate in the battle. However, the anti-Axis forces have already transferred a large number of reinforcements from overseas to assist in the fighting.</p>
<h3>Papal Appeal</h3>
<p>Vatican City, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Pope Pius XII, addressing the College of Cardinals, stated that anyone who dares to raise a hand against the city of Rome will be deemed to have committed the "matricidal" crime of "killing one's mother" by "divine justice."</p>
<p>Naval Battle Once Occurred in the Northern Italian Waters</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced: On the morning of May 31, German naval light vessels engaged in a naval battle with six British fast boats in the Ligurian Sea off Italy. The German light vessels sank one British boat and damaged another. Although the British fast boats fired several torpedoes, the German vessels suffered no losses. They later engaged again southeast of Bastia, and the British boats fled westward.</p>
<h3>German Counterattacks Break the Silence on the Eastern Front; Busy Soviet Troop Movements in Front of Brest-Litovsk</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: The German offensive launched north of Iasi in Romania has broken the silence of the Eastern Front, which had lasted for many days. The German high command clearly attaches importance to this operation, as it is related to the struggle for important mountain ridges. The Soviets continue to concentrate troops and war materials on the southern route, and the Soviet authorities seem intent on crossing the river westwards downstream from Komst, while simultaneously launching an offensive southward from the middle reaches of the Seret River in an attempt to break the right flank of the German-Romanian allied forces. There is also a strong Soviet force waiting to advance from Ternopol-Brody to Lvov. On the northern route, Soviet forces are concentrating several divisions of rifle and motorized troops in the Vitebsk, Pskov, and Narva areas.</p>
<h3>Pro-German Cabinet Formed in Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Sofia, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: The Bulgarian Regency Council accepted the resignation of the Bailov cabinet on Thursday and immediately authorized former Minister of Agriculture Bagrianov to form a new cabinet.

He was promoted to colonel in 1925, then retired. In 1937, he was elected to parliament. He lived in seclusion again from February 1941 until today.</p>
<h3>Harriman Arrives in Moscow</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman, and the President of the American Chamber of Commerce, Johnston, arrived in Moscow yesterday.

<h3>Captured American Airmen Sentenced to Death by German Court</h3>
<p>Zurich, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Berlin dispatch in the Swiss newspaper, the German government's severe criminal punishment of American aircraft pilots has been confirmed, stating that the American bombing tactics are unprecedented since the beginning of the European war and have aroused anger among the people.</p>
<p>American Aircraft Shot Down in Romania Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – German authorities claimed on the 1st that American aircraft bombed Romania on the 31st. Twenty-eight were shot down by the German-Romanian air force and anti-aircraft artillery.</p>
<h3>Recruiting New Students and Training Naval and Maritime Talents: Interview with President Jiang of the Central Naval Academy</h3>
<p>President Jiang Xiyuan of the Central Naval Academy and Chief Counselor Major General Sen and others from the academy, yesterday attended the regular press conference of the Japanese Fleet Press Department in Shanghai. During the meeting, President Jiang explained to reporters the current situation of the Naval Department's recruitment, which is outlined below: The Naval Department will hold the entrance examinations for students of the sixth class of the Central Naval Academy and the first class of the Central Higher Merchant Marine Academy in June and July. New students will be recruited simultaneously in Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Hankou, and Guangzhou. The registration in Shanghai and Suzhou will be handled by the Central Naval Academy. In the Great East Asia War, it is felt that maritime transport and the navy cannot be separated, and the high prices of essential goods for the people in the rear are of course the main reason. Therefore, in addition to the navy, maritime transport is equally important. The Merchant Marine Academy is the place to train maritime transport talents. This first enrollment of the Merchant Marine Academy is especially important, because the first graduates will be the future leaders of merchant ships. Therefore, the quality of the students must be strictly selected. It is hoped that outstanding young people will actively participate in the examination to serve China's maritime transport and lay the foundation for maritime transport. The Allied nations have very strict examinations for naval and maritime transport students, and their quality is excellent, so they have become today's excellent navy. What we should pay attention to is that Major General Sen then elaborated on the importance of naval spirit, which is more important than material things. The naval spirit is that excellent talents require excellent education. The American naval spirit is inferior. Even if it has material conditions, it is useless. This further illustrates the importance of cultivating naval talents.</p>
<h3>Minister Matsushima Discusses Wallace's Trip to Chongqing and Explains the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>At the routine meeting with Chinese reporters in Shanghai yesterday (2nd), Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department gave a speech on the Pacific war situation and Wallace's visit to Chongqing, and introduced President Jiang of the Central Naval Academy to meet with the reporters. The speech of Minister Matsushima is recorded below:</p>
<p>Today, I introduce President Jiang of the Central Naval Academy to meet with everyone. As in the past, I will first explain the war situation and then President Jiang will report to you on the enrollment of students for the Central Naval Academy and the Central Higher Merchant Marine Academy.</p>
<p>The Purpose of Wallace's Trip to Chongqing: This time, U.S. Vice President Wallace visited Chongqing via Siberia before Roosevelt was elected as President, which has attracted the world's attention in terms of military, political, and diplomatic aspects. There are many opinions on the intention and purpose of his visit to Chongqing. In short, there are several points: (A) How to solve the current difficulties of Chongqing in the military and economic aspects, especially after the Henan operation, the difficulties of Chongqing have increased day by day, and the needs of military supplies and economic pressure are the most serious problems at present. In the past, Chongqing was in urgent need of British and American aid, but in fact, only the aid of the air route was less than one ten-thousandth of what was hoped for. (B) Secondly, regarding international issues, there is also the relationship with the Soviet Union behind it, which is very important to the future fate of the Chongqing regime. The actual situation of the Pacific war is the opposite of what the enemy propagandizes. In fact, the enemy's activities are very few, and it is impossible for the enemy to reach the Chinese mainland. Assuming that it is possible to violate the time, the suffering of the Chinese people will be even greater than the current situation. Based on the above situation, the purpose of Wallace's visit to Chongqing is nothing more than to adjust the Chongqing government and make the Chongqing government revitalize.</p>
<p>Chongqing Exposes Its Inferior Dependency</p>
<p>Before Wallace arrived, Chongqing secretly convened the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, which closed on May 26. Many resolutions on the Twelfth Plenary Session, such as implementing constitutional government and adjusting prices, have been published. The most important and noteworthy thing is that Chongqing announced its resistance to the Axis powers to the end. According to the Reuters report on May 25, the British Foreign Secretary made a speech praising Chongqing's eight years of war, but the United Kingdom has provided very little assistance to Chongqing, which is tantamount to exposing the United Kingdom's inability. According to the results of the Twelfth Plenary Session, it is still hoped that the United Kingdom and the United States will provide a large amount of materials, which can expose Chongqing's dependence and lose China's face. It is conceivable that the leaders of the Chongqing regime have no independent and autonomous spirit. Therefore, the Twelfth Plenary Session had to be held before Wallace arrived in Chongqing, from which it can be seen that Chongqing's difficulties are heavy.</p>
<p>Entering the Inner Line Will Inevitably Suffer a Painful Blow</p>
<p>Regarding the current situation of the Pacific war, since the U.S. military landed on Biak Island in New Guinea, under the joint operations of the Japanese army and navy, the enemy has been continuously expanding the attrition war. Except for a part of the enemy on Biak Island, the rest has been gradually eliminated by the Japanese army. Of course, Biak Island is also an important area strategically. If the enemy makes this a base, the Japanese army in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies will also be affected. But on the other hand, the enemy is entering the Japanese inner line and will inevitably suffer a fierce attack from the Japanese army. The enemy's advance has followed the Japanese's predetermined points and lines, that is, the place that the Japanese hope to come. The Japanese army has long been prepared and will definitely give the enemy a devastating blow.</p>
<p>The Triangle Sea Area is the Enemy's Cemetery</p>
<p>From Taiwan to Singapore to Biak Island, a triangular sea area can be called the Mediterranean of Asia. At the beginning of the Great East Asia War, the United Kingdom and the United States wanted to maintain this Mediterranean of Asia, and built the eastern security equipment in Hong Kong and Singapore before the Great East Asia War. Although the triangle that the United Kingdom and the United States thought of is different from the area that the Japanese thought of, the meaning is the same. The United Kingdom and the United States attach importance to this Mediterranean of Asia, and so does Japan. In the future, the battle for this triangular area will be very fierce. Premier Tojo's declaration stated that Japan would soon shift from a defensive to an offensive stance. The specific situation of this offensive and defensive shift is inconvenient to disclose, and perhaps it can be seen in the battle for the Mediterranean of Asia.</p>
<p>The New U.S. Navy Commander is an Amateur</p>
<p>Since the attrition war in this area has been actively carried out since the end of May, it can be seen from the speech made by the U.S. Navy Commander Forrestal that the enemy's steps have been disrupted. The content of his speech is obviously different from that of Knox, and there are many contradictions, proving that he is an amateur. The enemy will fight with this kind of leader, and the future results can be imagined. Forrestal said that the U.S. Navy's naval ship production has greatly increased, but it is the opposite of what Lewis said on June 1, and there are conflicts and contradictions with each other. Stephen, the secretary of the U.S. President, met with reporters and said that according to the German claim, the American pilots who bombed Germany and were shot down can be killed by the German people anytime and anywhere. This kind of propaganda is completely untrue, etc. From this, it can be seen that the American pilots are afraid of death and comfort them. However, the Japanese side is completely different from the enemy American. According to Tsukahara, the head of the Japanese Aviation Headquarters, the production of Japanese aircraft is greatly improving, and the aircraft used in the front line will soon exceed the enemy's several times. In addition, shipbuilding production is also increasing in large quantities. Japan is making rapid progress day by day to complete its strategic goals.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Pays Attention to Two Points in Operations</p>
<p>In the future, we will pay attention to two points: (1) To destroy the British and American attack forces at sea. (2) To increase transportation capacity and make combat power more advanced. In the battle to destroy the enemy, the Japanese side, in view of the importance of the Great East Asia War on the Chinese mainland, hopes that the Chinese navy and maritime transport will have considerable progress, and we are very much looking forward to this. Recalling the position of the Chinese navy and water police in the world in 1890, if it can continue to develop in this way and unite with the Japanese navy and maritime transport, it will have extremely powerful strength. We hope that the Chinese navy will be particularly developed, and Chinese maritime transport will be particularly developed, which will be very beneficial to the Great East Asia War. Even if a hundred Wallaces visit Chongqing, it is not worth our attention. Now I would like to introduce President Jiang of the Central Naval Academy to talk to you.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Issues Proclamation to Stop Rice Price Hike, Takes Necessary Measures to Stabilize Public Morale</h3>
<p>The black market price of rice in this city has increased sharply in recent days, which has a profound impact on the people's food. In order to stop the price hike and stabilize the people's morale, the municipal government, in addition to taking necessary measures, has specifically issued a proclamation. It is expected that after these measures are taken, the food problem of the city's residents will improve. The full text of the two proclamations is recorded below:</p>
<p>Unlimited Quantity Without Passport (Proclamation 1) Announcement: It has been investigated that the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Rice for Shanghai Citizens" have been promulgated. Before the "Management Measures for Rice Grain Import in This City" is promulgated, merchants and nearby farmers transporting rice grains to Shanghai are exempted from obtaining passports and certificates, and are free to enter various import ports in this city. The quantity is also not limited. Henceforth, it is proclaimed for general knowledge.</p>
<p>Order the Rice Industry to Establish Procurement Groups (Proclamation 2) Announcement: Now, according to Article 2 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of Food Rice for Citizens: "For the purpose of implementing the measures, the municipal government shall order the registered rice stores to establish procurement groups according to administrative districts, and each group shall have one group leader, designated by the allocation of household rice agencies." According to this regulation, each registered rice store in this city should immediately convene an industry association to establish procurement groups separately according to the distribution of rice stores in each administrative district of this city. The candidates for the group leader should first be recommended by the industry in a range of three to five people and submitted to the Municipal Grain Bureau and the Economic Department of the First District Public Office for joint verification. As for the funds required for purchasing rice grains, according to Article 13 of the aforementioned Management Provisional Measures, in principle, the procurers and rice stores shall prepare themselves. However, in order to encourage the adequate import of food rice and sympathize with the business difficulties, if the funds are indeed insufficient, they may apply to the municipal government to negotiate with the bank to provide loans as appropriate. All rice merchants should follow these rules. Henceforth, it is proclaimed for general knowledge.</p>
<h3>Silkworm Cocoon Loan Continues to Borrow 100 Million Yuan; Contract Will Be Signed with Syndicate</h3>
<p>Silk industry associations, silk factories and companies, etc., in order to purchase spring cocoons, had previously formed a loan syndicate with 15 banks including Bank of Communications, etc., establishing a loan of 500 million yuan. Due to the small amount of loan distribution, the group continued to borrow 100 million yuan from the group. After consultation, it was decided that seven banks including Bank of Communications, Shanghai, Guohua, Huaxing, Jianxing, Shanghai Industry and Commerce, and Dakang will undertake the loan. The loan will still be carried out by means of acceptance drafts, and the Central Reserve Bank recognizes rediscounting. It is said that the loan contract will be signed within days.</p>
<h3>Extension of Seven Days for Registration of Daily Necessities Inventory</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau previously processed the registration of soap, matches, candles, and coal inventory in various districts of Shanghai Municipality outside District 1, which was originally scheduled to end on May 31. Since the registration was very enthusiastic, some merchants and residents did not complete the registration within the deadline, especially those in the South City and Zhabei districts. They have requested an extension. In order to alleviate business difficulties, the deadline has been extended for seven days from June 1 to 7.</p>
<h3>Commercial Firms Must Affix Stamps to Invoices</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tax Bureau, in order to promote stamp tax revenue and facilitate the purchase of stamps by merchants and residents, has ordered industry associations to promote the legal purchase of stamps by member firms. It is now planning to approve 40 qualified tobacco exchange shops to sell stamp tax tickets. It is learned that the bureau has recently found that most companies and shops do not issue invoices for goods sold, in an attempt to evade affixing stamp tax tickets. This situation has a great impact on tax revenue. Therefore, a special order is issued to industry associations to advise member firms to comply with the regulations. Invoices must be issued for the price of goods sold at the door, and stamps must be affixed in accordance with the law to maintain national taxes.</p>
<h3>Three-wheeled Vehicles are Prohibited from Installing Strange Sound Devices</h3>
<p>The First Police Bureau of this city, in view of the fact that many of the sound devices installed on general three-wheeled vehicles and bicycles have violated the regulations or even make strange noises, and pay attention to the installation, which is sufficient to disturb the public and increase the noise. There is also a risk of danger. Therefore, it has been re-stipulated that all three-wheeled vehicles and bicycles, whether for private or business use, must be equipped with a bell, and any other sound device shall not be used. The hand-operated bell should be installed on the handlebars of the vehicle near the handshake, and should not be installed on the wheels. Violators will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Reader Scholarship News: Explanation on Application Procedures for the 7th Session</h3>
<p>The application method for the 7th session of the scholarship fund for readers of this newspaper is slightly different from previous sessions. Students register with the school they are attending, and after the school approves the application, it will collect the application form from the office on behalf of the students. The detailed method was announced in this newspaper on May 30, and letters have been sent to the schools that have filled out the school profile survey form. The purpose of this new method is to enable school authorities to participate in the review process, so that the selection of assisted students can be more rigorous, and at the same time save thousands of students the time and energy to travel back and forth and queue up. However, students often come to the museum to inquire about the method, and it seems that most schools have not received the emails sent by this office. It is hoped that school authorities and students will check this newspaper on May 30. Or prepare and send someone to this office to obtain a copy of the method to avoid unnecessary running around. As for the small number of students who have special circumstances, such as newly arriving in Shanghai from other places, or dropping out of school in the middle of the process, or the original school has been closed and there is no way to register with the school, they can write to this office to explain the reasons and submit documents. Application forms will be issued after June 15. Academic Lectures Tomorrow The second academic lecture held for assisted high school and above students will be held at the New Gate Road Primary School at 10 am tomorrow. Mr. Xu Yuanfang will talk about "A Review of China's Industry and the Future". It is hoped that those who have a lecture ticket will go on time. If there are those who have registered but the lecture ticket has not been sent, they can prepare a small piece of paper and write their name on it for examination.</p>
<p>Calligraphy Competition Extended The method of the "Practical Calligraphy Competition" held by this office has been published in this newspaper on the 27th. The original deadline for submission was June 4. Due to the post office's slack and delayed delivery, the deadline has been extended for another four days to the 8th. In addition, the students who are recruited must pay attention to the rules that are not followed.</p>

<p>The Tianjin United football expeditionary force suffered its first Waterloo in Shanghai yesterday, losing to the ever-victorious East China team by a score of three to nil. East China led two to nil in the first half. The audience at the racecourse yesterday afternoon was even more crowded than at the first game. All ticket revenue was allocated to social welfare expenses. East China displayed unparalleled power yesterday, playing with ease and reaching a peak, with unparalleled cooperation, living up to its reputation as an ever-victorious army.

<h3>Provisional Measures for Rice: Suggestions for Supplementation; Advisory Committee Requests Adoption by Authorities</h3>
<p>Since the Executive Yuan issued the provisional measures for rice for the citizens of Beijing and Shanghai, the Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Advisory Committee believes that there is a need to formulate implementing rules and has drafted a proposal for the municipal authorities, requesting that it be adopted as much as possible when the Rice Control Association and relevant parties discuss the details. The principles of the recommendations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1 of the Outline: "This outline is to stipulate the rice supply for the two cities under the principle of control." The so-called rice supply for the two cities in this article is entirely based on the principle of control, which is very reasonable. Therefore, various detailed rules in the implementation should also be promoted based on the principle and spirit of control, so as to avoid repercussions.</p>
<p>Article 2 of the Outline: "All approved purchasing merchants of the Rice Control Association and registered rice shops in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as nearby farmers, who transport their own harvested rice to urban areas for sale, may apply to the Rice Control Association for a rice transportation permit. However, the Rice Control Association shall slightly purchase rice for military, police, and important party items according to a certain percentage. The regulations for the purchase percentage are as follows: (乙) Purchasing merchants who have not paid off the original order or are newly added, the percentage of purchase is also divided into three types, which seems not unified and is prone to malpractices during handling. It is expected that participating purchasing merchants, even if they have not already paid off the original order in both places, will also borrow names to reduce the purchase percentage. Therefore, the types of purchasing merchants and the purchase percentage should be unified. According to the investigation, less than one-tenth of the rice shops in Shanghai have applied to the Rice Control Association to become purchasing merchants. For now, it seems that the original purchasing merchant status of members of the former rice grain association who are currently engaged in miscellaneous business should be restored, and they should continue to operate in accordance with the methods prescribed by the Rice Control Association to make the best use of their expertise. Furthermore, farmers who transport their own harvested rice to the city for sale, if it is less than one stone, it seems that they can be exempted from applying for a permit and not be required to purchase rice for the military and police, because farmers can also move three to five dou to the city for sale when the rice market is open. Now that the rice market is open, it seems that farmers should not be restricted instead."</p>
<p>Article 3 of the Outline: "The purchase price of purchased rice shall be determined at any time according to the actual cost plus legal profits, except as otherwise provided in item B of Article 1." The so-called actual cost in this article is currently complex and difficult to calculate. If you want the "actual cost" to become a reality, you must be sure of the transportation and expenses in both producing and selling areas. According to a recent survey, merchants mostly transport goods from Wuhu by barge to Beijing, and then load them onto trains.</p>
<p>The cost is not small, and losses are not included. The cost is even greater. Under the recent railway transportation situation (no actual liability), the leakage and shortage of goods are inevitable. Although people can be hired to escort the goods, the effect is minimal. Therefore, the loss per car must be at least 10%. The responsible personnel in charge of loading and unloading in both places are difficult to guarantee that there will be no difficulties. Water transport is full of thorns and difficult to obtain protection, and various relevant agencies in various regions are demanding. If the above unexpected expenses cannot be resolved, then the cost cannot be calculated, and the price is difficult to control, which is completely contrary to the principle of control. The remedy is only to consider the two most important points: Land transport for loading cars must first consult with China Railway Company to improve the system (the cost of the personnel added after the system is improved can be subsidized by the Rice Control Association or the freight can be increased). At the same time, the Railway Bureau is requested to give priority to civilian food in addition to military needs and try to add vehicles for priority transportation.</p>
<p>For water transport, the loading and unloading docks should be assigned military and police to organize escort teams. The team members should focus on quality rather than quantity, and they should be transferred at any time to avoid problems over time. It is firmly believed that if the escort team can be managed perfectly, all agencies in various places can provide assistance, and incidents of robbery and extortion along the way can be eliminated. Unexpected losses can be avoided, and then the actual cost can be calculated before determining the legal profit.</p>
<p>Article 4 of the Outline: "All rice transported to Beijing and Shanghai, except for those purchased by the Rice Control Association, can be bought and sold at free prices. However, in order to prevent hoarding and profiteering, the scope shall be determined by the municipal government in conjunction with the Rice Control Association." The price of the remaining part of the war sales shall be reviewed and approved by the Rice Control Association based on cost and profit. However, the buying and selling behavior should still be promoted under the principle of control in accordance with Article 1 of this outline, that is, rice shops and grain merchants purchase from the interior at the price set by the Rice Control Association and sell to the Rice Control Association, which distributes it to various rice shops, and then sells it to the people with the current household ration tickets. In this way, neither purchasing merchants nor rice shops can hoard or manipulate. As for the rice funds of the Rice Control Association, if they are transferred to the bank separately, it will cause a lot of trouble. It is better for the Rice Control Association to discuss with the Central Trust Bureau to advance funds to purchase rice (according to the bureau's original regulations for advance purchase). Fortunately, the Rice Control Association can take the value from the rice shop and repay the loan in an instant, so the issue of the advance is not important. The cost of rice in the interior varies from place to place, and the Rice Control Association must determine it together with the local county government, county chamber of commerce, and farmers' association based on the cost plus legal profit. Free price increases are not allowed to conform to the principle of control.</p>
<p>Article 5 of the Outline: "If rice is moved into rice killing without a rice control association permit, it shall be regarded as private rice and punished according to the central government's laws and regulations." If rice is moved into rice killing without a rice control association permit, it is private rice. However, Article 6 of the outline states that the Rice Control Association shall designate temporary permit issuance offices at the moving entrance in the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai, and may issue transportation permits to rice merchants who have not applied for permits at any time. It seems that the designated rice merchants have not obtained the Rice Control Association's iron permit in advance, but when the rice is transported to the moving entrance, they can also apply for a permit at the temporary permit issuance office and move it into the city, and it is not regarded as private rice. The articles seem to conflict or need to be rectified.</p>
<p>Article 7 of the Outline: "The above-mentioned permits shall be uniformly managed by the Rice Control Association in accordance with the original application requirements, and any fees shall be waived for rice purchase certificates and rice to avoid malpractices. The issuance locations shall be announced by the Rice Control Association in advance, and the issuance date and expiration date shall be indicated on the permits, stipulating that it shall not expire in a few days, and no fees shall be charged, so as to comply, and the responsible person shall sign and seal the permit. The issuance procedures shall be carried out in the most expeditious manner."</p>
<p>In addition, when rice merchants transport rice to Shanghai, whether by water or land, the Rice Control Association should designate a suitable wharf and warehouse, and limit the time within which the rice must be delivered to the Municipal Rice Control Association, otherwise the Rice Control Association will punish them. There are three important points attached below:</p>
<p>The Rice Control Association must organize grain merchants in a planned manner before purchasing so that they can be handled in districts and groups in accordance with the law, and free competition is not allowed to conform to the principle of control.</p>
<p>If the municipal government and the Rice Control Association have decided to allow farmers to transport rice to the two cities, and the quantity is within one stone, they should be exempted from the transportation permit and not be required to purchase military rice. This should be announced immediately. Because people have been in a panic recently, thinking that the government's announcement of the provisional measures for rice is to tighten control, and farmers are not allowed to transport their own harvested rice to urban areas for sale. Therefore, even if a small number of rice is transported, residents will scramble to buy it all, and at the same time, sellers will take the opportunity to raise prices, and the price will rise sharply. The situation is extremely serious. Therefore, it is hoped that close attention will be paid and the method will be clearly announced as soon as possible to stop the rumors and curb the rising prices. In any undertaking, the most important thing is personnel issues, especially in handling people's food. If there are new methods but the environment remains the same, it will be difficult to achieve practical results. Supervision and visitation seem indispensable. Can the municipal government and the Rice Control Association organize a inspection committee, hire people of high moral standing to serve as committee members, and observe and correct them at any time?</p>

<h3>Thoughts on the June 3rd Commemoration</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jun</p>
<p>Today is the June 3rd Commemoration Day, commemorating the story of Lin Zexu, the Governor-General of Liangguang, burning opium in Guangdong more than a hundred years ago (in 1839 AD, the 19th year of the Daoguang period of the former Qing Dynasty). I remember that Mr. Lin Zexu submitted a memorial to the Qing court, bitterly denouncing the many and serious harms of opium. The original text once said, "If opium is not banned, the country will become poorer day by day, and the people will become weaker day by day. After more than ten years, not only will there be no funds to plan, but there will also be no soldiers to use." These few words are so sad and so accurate. Mr. Lin, with his foresight, resold opium to China. This may not be a page in China's glorious history. However, Britain, relying on its strong military power, went to war with our country, which is what history calls the "Opium War." As a result of the war, our country failed because of its corrupt rule and internal disunity. In 1842 AD, the Treaty of Nanjing—an unequal treaty—was signed, ceding Hong Kong and opening up aggression. Following the example, unequal treaties were signed, turning into a century of painful history. In the late Qing Dynasty, poisonous gas spread throughout the country, and officials and people openly smoked opium. They wore the title of "Sick Man of East Asia" and were despised by countries all over the world. Although the intrusion of opium was a British conspiracy, the popularity of opium was really the fault of the Chinese people. At that time, education was very elegant and politics was very corrupt. The government turned a blind eye to the darkness and allowed it to happen. The people were drunk and dreaming and addicted to smoking. Therefore, without clearing up the politics, there was no way to talk about banning opium, and without popularizing education, there was no way to talk about quitting smoking. The opium ban in the late Qing Dynasty had its name, but it was not real. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the British and Americans have used tricks to sow discord, and domestic wars have not ended. The opium ban has been implemented and relaxed alternately. During the seventh and eighth years of the Republic of China, the Beijing government handled the opium ban and bought up the opium stored by foreign merchants. Judicial Vice Minister Zhang Yipeng was specially sent to Shanghai to supervise the burning. There were a total of 1,013 large boxes and 194 small boxes of opium. At that time, the government expressed its determination, and both China and foreign countries were impressed. This is also a valuable page in the history of opium bans. In the sixteenth year, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and designated June 3 as the Opium Prohibition Commemoration Day. In April of the twenty-fourth year, when our Chairman was the President of the Executive Yuan, he followed the Father of the Nation's [illegible] call and promulgated a five-year ban. At the same time, banning smoking, banning sales, banning transportation, and banning planting were implemented. Unfortunately, because the unequal treaties had not been abolished, the diplomatic difficulties could not be broken, and the August 13th Incident occurred halfway through, and the opium ban was relaxed again, and all previous efforts were wasted. The British once again took the opportunity to sell opium, using Hong Kong as a storage base and Shanghai as a source to complete their consistent economic aggression and the conspiracy to poison the people. Fortunately, the "Greater East Asia War" broke out, the British retreated, and Hong Kong, Shanghai, and various concessions were recovered one after another, and the unequal treaties were abolished. The source and the storage base no longer exist. If the opium poisoning suffered for more than a hundred years is not taken advantage of at this time to eradicate it completely, then when will the stains be washed away forever? When can the great humiliation be completely washed away? In view of this, our Chairman decided to reiterate the previous order in March of this year to continue the implementation of the ban, from March 30 of this year to March 29 of the 36th year as the complete ban period. The Opium Prohibition Bureau of the Ministry of Interior was established on April 1 of this year, only half a year after the recovery of the concessions; the location is also related to the history of the "Opium War" in Shanghai. Today is also the date when the registration of opium addicts began in the urban area of Shanghai. For various reasons, I have a lot of feelings. So I want to say a few words to my compatriots. What are the few words that I want to say? That is, my compatriots should first know that China's weakness is due to opium, because when the people smoke opium, their spirits are weak, and they are unwilling to work hard in any undertaking. Secondly, they should know that China's China will become rich and strong, and opium must be banned. Fourthly, I hope that my compatriots will awaken each other. From today, the Great Opium Prohibition Commemoration Day, I hope they will quickly realize that compatriots who have opium addiction should quickly and voluntarily quit, and never smoke again. Compatriots who do not smoke opium should never get into this bad habit. We must ensure that the remaining poison of opium will no longer exist or breed in our country after the prohibition period. This is what I hope and pray for today.</p>

<h3>Promote Respect for the Elderly Movement: Intend to Designate June 6 as Respect for the Elderly Day</h3>
<p>Our country designates April 4 every year as Children's Day. The work of "caring for children" and "blessing children" has aroused the attention of the people across the country. However, no one has yet advocated the commemoration that should be given to the respect for the elderly movement. Love proposes that June 6 be designated as "Respect for the Elderly Day" in order to achieve the meaning of "cherishing my young and cherishing the young of others" and "respecting my old and respecting the old of others," because "caring for children" and "respecting the elderly" are both important tasks that we should do. The purpose of "Respect for the Elderly Day" is to thank the elderly for their past hard work, to provide the elderly with spiritual peace or material assistance, so that they can enjoy a happy life. Therefore, on this day, respect for the elderly celebrations, symposiums, dinners, tea parties should be held, or the organization of a visiting elderly group, the promotion of health exercises for the elderly, the relief of poor and sick elderly, and the establishment of nursing homes.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Commemorating June 3</h3>
<p>Today is the June 3rd Commemoration. On this day 105 years ago, Lin Wenzhonggong's act of burning opium in Humen was firm and impassioned, making the British lose their minds. Today, as we commemorate the martyrs, we should first express our respect and learn from the spirit of fearlessness. Secondly, we should express our admiration for the determination to ban opium and insist on it. The scourge of opium has harmed China the most. For more than a hundred years, it has caused our people's health to be damaged and the nation's will to be weakened. It has put the Chinese nation in a semi-colonial position, and the opium poison is the most severe. We are determined to learn from the pain, and we will never forget the enemy Britain's means of destroying people. Moreover, because Lin Gong's opium ban was an effective rejection of the British's poisoning conspiracy, it triggered the Opium War and opened the door to the conclusion of unequal treaties, and the poisoning became an uncontrollable spread. We are determined to learn from the pain, and we will never forget the enemy Britain's means of aggression. Since the Greater East Asia War, British and American forces have been driven out. Last year, with the help of our ally Japan, we recovered the concessions and gradually abolished the unequal treaties, releasing the shackles of a hundred years. However, the opium poisoning that opened the door to unequal treaties, although repeatedly banned, has not disappeared. Today, as we commemorate Lin Gong's opium ban, the opium poison still exists after more than a hundred years, how can we not feel ashamed! However, shame does not make up for the facts. The only way is to learn from the spirit of fearlessness of the martyrs, insist on the determination of the martyrs to ban opium, and completely ban opium in order to be worthy of the martyrs. In February of this year, the government announced a three-year opium ban, stipulating that from March 30 of this year to March 29 of the 36th year, it will be gradually banned within three years. We hope to achieve this within this time limit and wash away the humiliation of a hundred years ago.</p>
