<h3>統制的本質</h3>
<p>戰時統制的目的在管理資源，謀戰爭勝利早日的獲得。統制的方法一面要節約物資，使無絲毫的消費，一面要增加生產，使補充戰爭必需的消耗。對於在戰場上戰鬥的將士要源源不絕地供給必須的物資，使將士們努力戰爭，而不致因物資問題而受影響。對於不在戰場上不直接參加戰爭的國民，要安定他們最低的生活，使他們發揮生產的最大力量，然後能夠繼續不斷地增產，繼續不斷地供給整個前方和後方的需要。所以最理想的戰時統制的效果，前方將士和後方民眾都能夠過著最簡單的生活，分工合作，前方殺敵致果，後方努力增產，整個國民好像一座機器，國民的力量是齊一得，集中地。　　戰時統制辯得最有成效的是德國和日本德國在吃了上次大戰時經濟封鎖的大虧之後，此次更十二分的周密，從一九三九年起差不多全國國民都有飯吃，都有工做，政府要使每個人都有飯吃，政府要使每個人必須做工。政府決不使能做工的人，因為生活困難而減少他的工作能力，決不使能夠生產的工廠，因為動力原料等等的問題而減少他的生產量。對於工作的人配給他的生活需要品，對於工作的工廠配給他的動力和原料，從工廠裡出來的生產品因此亦都由國家管理，軍用的和日常生活所用的物品在細密的計劃之下，更分別供給前後方的使用，這樣周而復始，將士們有飯吃，有軍器打仗，民眾們有飯吃，有工作做，國無間人，地無荒土，應付任何長期的戰爭都可操必勝之券。　　這樣的統制制度是需要政府在戰前有長期的準備的，著在中國，說來可憐，戰前既沒有準備，戰後又沒有調整。目前的統制制度又沒有能夠達到理想的目標，更足以引起許多人的惡印象。就把上海來講，有這麼許多人，可是並沒有做到每個人都有工作的地步。而有工作的人，加入完全依靠配給而不另外從黑市想法的話，生存是不可能的。上海這麼許多工廠，但是並沒有做到個個工廠開工的地步。而能夠開工的工廠，他的生產品雖然能夠自由出售，假如完全依照限價的話，決計抵不過動力原料人工等等的成本，一切只是矛盾，只是給壞人利用的機會。整個的統制方法亟須立刻調整，否則前途不可設想，這不是杞人之憂，而是事實上必然的結果。</p>
<h3>日空軍猛烈轟聲雷伊泰灣敵艦隊</h3>
<p>日新銳戰機源源出現前綫</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央設電　日艦隊十九日白晝冒惡劣天氣，強襲雷伊泰灣，炸沉敵戰艦兩艘，驅逐艦一艘。二十日之攻擊，日軍以戰鬥機。轟炸機聯合艦隊，冒惡劣之天氣，於上午八時頃，猛炸斯爾旦島附近之敵空母羣，計炸毀敵空母二艘，下午四時頃，復於雷伊泰灣內，炸沉敵大型運輸船一艘，炸毀其他運輸船一艘。　　南太平洋某基地二十四日中央設電　日後方增產陣，現正日以繼夜，積極製造飛機，當次激烈之空戰聲中，次對餔綫自有莫大影響，今最新銳之飛機相機送往前先後，固日軍前線將兵無不狂喜，當此相繼痛擊英美之時，生產陣之績，实不可磨灭，日軍現有之新銳機，堪為日科學界之精華，具有美國超空要塞Ｂ２９型機速度與性能，日新銳機編隊，堂堂沖入高空，既有聲滅敵人之權能，於每次邀擊敵人時，無不收獲極大戰果，固日軍最前綫基地將士對生產此種新銳機之產業戰士，均一致表示感謝之意。</p>
<h3>日軍事專家</h3>
<p>談菲島戰局　　東京二十四日中央設電　日軍事專家伊滕征德氏，傾談美軍進攻菲律賓事，據稱：合灣之大海戰，可與珍珠灣之役相匹，，其內容亦類似，一九四一年美軍戰！為進攻主力時，日軍一舉殲滅其百分之五十以上。一九四四年，美軍以航空母艦進攻主力時，日本在合灣海面一舉擊滅其中心勢力，予其主力以重創，此點在價值上雖與珍珠灣之役相同，然在條件上則相異，蓋在攻守上不同也。自戰略大局觀，美國在戰術上立於防守地位，因之珍珠灣後之開始反攻，須要經過長時期之準備，然而近日彼等為整個戰術的進攻體制，雖遭台灣海空戰之大敗，仍在一定之期間內，於旋　進攻菲律賓，敵軍之繼續進攻，乃日本所求之不得者，戰局已屬一大階段，為期戰勝之之基礎鞏固之時，又獲得第二次大勝，實堪歡欣。敵美之所蟋念者，亦在今後之作戰，台灣海面另一挫折後，戰事全局已有敗色矣。</p>
<h3>尼科巴島海面</h3>
<p>日空軍戰績　　某部隊幕僚發表談話　　日軍前殺基地二十四日中央設電　日機隊對攻擊印度洋尼科巴羣島海域之敵英機動部隊，出以先發制人攻勢，當炸沉炸毀共四艘，是項戰果，日大本營二十日已發表，其後更判明作戰之詳細經過，二十三日以某部隊幕僚談話之形式發表如次：於美機動部隊侵入雷伊泰</p>
<p>灣後，英機動部隊既於十七日最接近日方尼科巴羣島加尼科巴島，然日某空軍部隊，十九日踴礶出動，獲舉炸毀敵航空母艦，驅逐艦各一艘之大戰果，其間作戰情況，非常熾烈，即日軍某部隊，負有擊滅此項敵軍之任務，十九日以戰鬥機編隊，進至加尼科巴島附近，作戰開始前，敵機動部隊之配備狀況，概略如次：○巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘之一羣，刻向加尼科巴島東南方十五里之海域西進中。○戰艦或巡洋艦一艘，靜停於加尼科巴島南方二十公里至海面上，炮擊加尼科巴島。○戰艦一艘，驅逐艦六艘之一擊，於其西方東方進中。○印度米達布爾型空母一艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦三艘之一擊，刻由加尼科巴島西南二十公里海面南進中。日機於是日十二時許，飛至加尼科巴東南方敵上空，於蕓間發現敵軍後，既予以攻擊，斯時敵戰鬥機約二十架突由正面襲來，日空軍無論於高度上，機敗上，雖有種種不利條件，然勇敢與敵交戰，激戰約半小時許，擊落敵機四架，另有七架未證實，共擊落十一架，並證實敵巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘起火沉沒。當時日機阿部編隊已飛至最上空，雖未能由隊長機證實，然據自家尼科巴島於地上所判明者，日機於是日十二時二十分許發現敵機後，當即展開空戰，旋脫離敵機之攻擊，落至低空，三架全力接近敵機動部隊後，初似為阿部中尉機，以軍機直向敵印度米達爾型敵空母俯衝降下，以機身帶魚雷，勇猛拼撞敵空母，瞬間，即被黑烟包圍，迨黑烟逸散時，二萬七千噸級敵空母之姿影，即於海上不見矣。阿部編隊之第二架機，同樣衝撞敵驅逐艦，將之炸沉，繼續第三架，亦由東南方前進，之敵繼續猛然撞去，使受重創，於是，即以此戰鬥機樹立轟沉敵空母之偉勳。如次，日軍只以一架數噸之戰鬥機，而將敵空母轟沉，實為彼等夢想不及這也。</p>
<h3>桂省日軍前綫</h3>
<p>聞靈川炸聲　　廣西前綫二十四日中央設電　廣西戰線之日軍精銳，連日盲雨進攻，在過去一星期間，由第一綫可聞得靈川。桂林北方面之轟炸聲，井見烟幕上騰，知渝軍似已決定放棄靈川，故將該市內外之軍事設施及重要機關加以破壞。</p>
<h3>日陸軍省發表褒揚兩飛行隊</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央設電　日陸軍省二十三日發表，軍司令官頃對薩邦飛行派遣隊及島田飛行部隊分別授予褒狀如左：　　一薩邦飛行派遣隊褒狀，右派遣隊於隊長陸軍大尉日淺義一指揮下，担任印度洋哨戒事宜，本年七月二十五日，敵機動部隊來襲薩邦附近時，該隊長機正從事哨戒，不失良機，報告其狀況，使該方面日陸。海軍部隊之戰備得保完璧。同時繼續哨戒，及發現海上之敵潛艇後，乃以英勇果敢精神，實烈對空炮射擊，噴出炸焰，終於將其炸沉，完成全體捐軀之壯烈陣亡。又大野中尉機，對其他海上之敵潛艇，不容其有潛沒之餘裕，使完全投下之炸彈悉行命中，而將其炸沉。又陸上整備員迅速修復敵空襲下，炮擊下被彈受傷之飛機與機場，使空中戰力之發揮得告完全，上項行動，乃該派遣隊員以隊長偉中心，秉空陸一體之偉大敢門精神，而將航空戰力之精神，作無遣憾之發揮著，其武功超羣，特此授予褒狀。　　二島田飛行隊褒狀，島田飛行隊在該隊隊長島田三郎陸軍大尉統帥下，於昭和十八年至昭年十九年八月上旬，在澳洲北部從事海上保護作戰，迭奏膚功，對加重威脅日運輸船團之敵潛艇，予以重創。按該部隊從事澳洲北部海上作戰，計八千零八次，日運輸船得其掩護，共達三百餘艘，並時常充分發揮其偵察之特性，奇襲敵艦，收穫炸沉敵艦七艘。炸毀三艘之戰果，完成掩護船團之任務，其貢獻於澳洲北部方面作戰準備之處，誠極深且鉅。而島田部隊長尤能以卓越之技能，身臨前敵，指揮作戰，親自炸沉敵潛艇二艘，並曾於昭和十九年七月二十八日，在阿馬哈伊灣上空，突與敵Ｆ３８型機十二架遭遇，隊長軍機與之周旋，達三十分鐘之久，卒告壯烈陣亡。但該隊之士氣益形旺盛，卒於是八年四月日，更收穫炸沉敵潛艇一艘之戰果，此實可謂</p>
<p>為由於部隊長英明統帥，能以隊長為中心，造成強固團結與日盛精神有以致之，故其武功實足永垂不朽，茲特授予褒狀，昭和十年八月二十二日日軍司令官。　　三陸軍士小島文夫，篮野美秀兩名，自昭和十八年十一月起，於敵潛水艇跳梁熾烈之澳北海面，屢屢從事護重要交通之作戰，並擊沉敵潛艇甚夥。昭和十九年九月十五日，敵軍在哈爾馬黑拉及摩羅泰島開始登陸時，兩名於十六日為隊長幕僚機献身空戰，而於摩羅泰海面附近發現北進中之敵巡洋艦，逐即發動攻擊，斯時第一彈即命中低艦艦尾，同時自身亦受創傷，於是即向敵艦致命部份衝擊，使之爆炸燃燒，逐乃壯烈犧牲。斯全由於具有盡忠報國之崇高理念，故能發揮其偉大之犧牲精神。茲特授予褒狀，以資表揚。</p>

<h3>蘇軍主力被圍</h3>
<p>— 東普魯士境內</p>
<p>洪境蘇軍沿多瑙河推進　　柏林二十四日中央設電　海通社訊：東普魯士邊境戰事，現自蒂爾西特（Ｔｉｌｓｉｔ）至奧格斯托伏一帶進行中，德軍在蒂爾西特之戰綫，已渡米美爾河向南後移，蘇軍僅在科那斯～崗比寧公路，得獲突入德軍基地，向西面哥爾達著擴大其戰果。德軍自希斯向西後移後，惡戰即在希斯與哥爾達普之間進行，經激烈之巷戰後，哥爾達普城逐告失陷。　　柏林二四四日中央社電　每通社訊：崗比寧以南，德坦克部隊已將蘇軍坦克車及至少步兵三師之主力包圍，正予殲滅中。蘇軍於崗比寧東南及埃救，均被擊退，德機亦在天空助戰。　　柏林二十四日中央社電　海通社訊：德元首行營發表，洪牙利南部方面蘇軍，正於泰斯河西方沿多瑙河前進　　日內瓦二十四日中央社電　德國社訊：澳洲政府已承認特戈爾政府為法國臨時政府，澳外長伊凡特已通知法駐澳大使館。利牙洪國經變政</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　此間｛每日新聞｝布達佩斯特派員，就洪牙利薩拉西政府成立之經過，報告如次：十月十五日為洪牙利大亂之一日，下午一時平時廣播突然停止，而朗讀霍爾第攝政布告，講洪牙利政府鑒於蘇軍之攻擊，為防衛國土，曾講求德軍補充百萬大軍，但德軍未予實行，故月下決定與敵方進入和平交涉云，至此，洪牙利舉國逐陷於混亂狀態。嗣一般反對和平之民眾高呼箭十字靈魂藤拉西之名，奮起抵抗之聲，充滿領頭巷尾。是時和平派佔據王宮，箭十字靈則罩起發動威力，武裝鎮壓，對攝政者及和平派均視為國民公敵而逮捕之。當攝政佈告廣播後，未出數小時，至下午八時之特別廣播中，為箭十字當領袖薩拉西之廣播通告國民曰，為洪牙利名譽之戰，目下仍然開始，秩序復趨安定民心亦告平穩。薩拉西新首相係反茂美民主主義最烈份之，統制國內一切，領導國民與德結成一片，掃除過去洪牙利所殘留不良情勢，向建設新秩序之途邁進。</p>

<h3>訪問冀東特寫</h3>
<p>一冀東特區的戰略意義　　談到冀東，想來不是一個陌生名辭吧！在事變以前，在那裡就樹立過一個所謂｛防共自治政府｝，當時會包括二十一縣而獲有東方瑞士之稱。隨著通州事變而｛政府｝解體，在臨時政府成立之後。始又恢復了過去｛北京政府｝時代之道尹制度，現在華北方面所新近設立的冀東特別區。大體上就是以前的冀東道，可是較諸以往的防共政府則範圍不免狹小了，因為特別區只包括冀東道十縣一市，而以唐山味其首府。　　唐山也是一個熟穩的都市吧，不進因為過去曾有唐山交通大學的設立，也因為這裏就是開灤煤礦的中心，至今那個開灤礦務局也還在那裏，而且在那裏工作的人員今正為一般華北公務員所羡美不置哩。因為開灤礦務局的職員，以最低級的來說，津薪就有三千元，而每月配給麵粉一包與煤一噸。至於中級的則津薪且達五千元之七八千元，而每月更配給麵粉二包至三包，煤三噸左右。上級的職責當然更不用說，他們的待遇科稱讀步華北樂。所以在華北無論任何軍管理的事業機關，或中日合辦的會社，他們的職員都趕不上開灤！唐山因為有開灤煤礦的緣故，能吸引大批的工人，所以市面非常繁榮，而且最近更整理了許多馬路，書鬧的馬路大都用洋灰鋪蓋。　　冀東能有這樣的一個都是傲它的首府，當然其含意是非常的深遠。尤其在增產決勝的時代，冀東既是華北最富庶的地帶而獲有殺藏倉之譽，且包括此煤礦中心，其所負的戰略使命自亦會增重大。可是在中共方面窺伺華北之際，冀東逐被視為活動的重要區城，因此華北政務委員會乃為防患於未燃計，於本年夏季（七月）毅然改廢道制，成立特別區。所謂特別區有異於昔日之道者，其特徵有二：一直為華北政務委員會，二匯合軍政會民的總力，樹立新體制以施善政。蓋今日首任冀東特別區行政長的姜鳳飛少將，即以華北綏塘軍總司令部唐山行營主任兼任，所以在此軍政一光化的新體制下，其政治前途自能冀其日趨明朗化。　　二六小時唐山一撇　　　記者來　之前，本有前赴唐山視察此種華北新政試驗的意思，所以就講舊友陳班候兄（現任綏靖公署秘書長）介紹於冀東的各當局，原來冀東實施新政治的唯一特色就是軍政一元化，那裏擔當實施行政的各當局也大都是綏靖公署或綏靖軍的舊人。因此，我就毫無困難地能夠在那裏得到一切的援助了。　　從天津到唐山，如果坐特快車只有三小時的路程，就是坐慢車也只有四小時。還是一個輕快的旅程，尤其沿途還可以使旅客觀光塘沽附近的豐田，三小時簡直覺得太短了。在華北旅行確實比在南方容易得多，如果坐一等或二等的旅客，我可以擔保其舒服的穩度和戰前一樣。在這裡，並沒有在南方所過到的：黑市購票，擁擠軋票或甚至種種不當需索等困難。不過在旅途中使我深感到強烈印象的，便是一般男的旅客大都穿著褐色的國民服或其它制服，而女的旅客更是大都穿著短裝。因為在這裡鐵道當局規定，無論男女皆須在旅途中穿防空服，所謂防空服即除規定式樣外，一切短裝都可以適用。所以在火車中，穿旗袍的婦女可稱絕無僅有。　　唐山的街道近來很整齊，當記者於午時抵站後，即僱着洋車巡遊全市一週。其中頂熱鬧的要算廣東大街，便宜街和新市場一帶，記者就在新市場的小桃園酒家獨酌一　。唐山的物價大都比天津便宜，記者在小桃園呌了半斤白干，冷盆（白鷄與松花）一碟，炒肝雜一碟和水餃二十枚，僅化去四十八元。因為物價低廉的緣故，據酒保說這裡的物資大多都流到天津去。當記者到唐山去的一天，正式各界忙著準備過秋節，特別區行政公署正在舉辦秋節農民聯歡會，而對於物資特別設法抑抵。現在我就約略地報告一些簡單的物價吧。食糧方面，大米每斤十二元，麵粉每斤七元五角。肉類方面，混合蟹每斤九元，大對蝦每斤二十六元，鯉魚每斤二十元，生鷄每隻二十七元，鵝蛋每個一元三角，番茄每斤三元二角，茄子每斤一元六角，土豆每斤二元二角，豬肉每斤二十一元，牛羊肉每斤二是二元，廣東月餅每斤六十元，酒的方面，這裏的　陽酒大瓶賣二十元，小瓶賣十元。（轉入第二版）</p>
<h3>渝軍對龍陵反攻失敗</h3>
<p>怒江西前綫二十四日中央社電　渝軍經龐大之犧牲，終奪回拉孟，驚越兩大要塞後，傾注　南達征軍主力九師之衆，向戰略要衛龍陵猛攻，遵日軍反擊，均告崩潰，目下從事於兵力及武器增補工作。龍陵日軍於八月二是七日得新銳增援部隊，突破渝軍包圍陣綫，與其他友軍協力反攻，渝軍築拉孟，　越方面之渝軍南下，集中於龍陵北方地區，因損耗過重，並但無反攻，乃建築第二第三防綫。</p>
<h3>官報號外披載日首相訓示政府官吏應垂範國民</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日小磯首相應前綫將士之奮戰，特要求政府官吏垂範全國國民，率先奮起，乃於二十三日之官報號外中披戰內閣訓示，其要點如次：一公務對於戰爭勝負之影響極大，故為官者應以至誠而執事，於行動坐臥之間，亦應表率垂範，藉以昂揚一般國民之必勝信念，若無秉公純正之心，雖玩弄美辭，亦難感膏起心，事故官吏應明示其率先垂範之根本精神，其中尤以與國民接近之初級官吏及地方官吏，更應特別注意地點。一法令乃一死文，其運營之巧，在於心之成稱，如當實施國家急務等，亦可不拘枝節，為貫徹戰時服務，要當努力於事務之簡捷化。一社會道義之昂揚，乃日本之美風，按戰時下社會道義之頒位乃交戰各國之通弊，是故為國家公僕之官吏，應極力防止風潮之惡化，同時。應讓處豁達，洞察人情微機，官民協和，共同邁向勝利之途。</p>

<h3>有馬少將奮戰犧牲松島部長深致哀悼</h3>
<p>此次菲島東方海面航空作戰一役，日本指揮官有馬健文少將，率先上陣奮戰，以所駕飛機向敵艦隊猛衝，與敵美航空母艦一艘，同歸於盡。日駐華艦隊報道部松島部長，曾受訓於少將，昨特發表感想如次：（有馬少將九州薩摩人氏，貌極溫善，初見決不料少將乃一氣魄豪爽之武人，嚴父爲一教育家，當吾等進軍校時，有馬少將擔任指導官附，對吾等指導極爲嚴密。少將以砲術家出身，於昭和十二年改攻航空科，屢建武勳，攻陷廣州時，有一部下飛機於半途被迫降落，少將挺身加以救援，當時幫助救援之三民信托公司總經理江汝舟，對少將之慈愛與勇猛，亦深表欽佩。余最後一次受到有馬少將之照拂，是在昭和十五年春，奉命轉任橫源賀鎮守府報道主任時，少將爲該航空隊副長，關於新銳飛機內容與日本海軍航空隊精神講解甚詳，具有至誠。貫徹不屈不撓精神之有馬少將，今次以身與敵航空母艦同歸於盡，亦可謂壯志已酬。在兵學校時代，常聞少將訓誡（松島君勉之一，余至今猶銘記不忘。）</p>
<p>汪汝舟氏發表感想</p>
<p>敵美於菲律賓開始蠢動以來，盟邦日本迎頭邀擊，予敵重創，造成此煊赫功勳，其航空部隊中一部隊指揮官有馬少將，竟以機自爆作壯烈之犧牲，其生前知友汪汝舟氏，特就此發表感想如次：昭和十三年間，有馬氏任（天龍）艦主席參謀時，余即於該艦服務，氏平素待人和靄，於中日問題，尤爲關懷。深以中日兩國同文同種，不應作鬩墻之門，希望中日兩國人士，共爲我東亞民族之前途努力。嗣後氏升任（神州）艦長，逐彼此分袂，憶該艦於南方作戰時，泊於汕頭江外，所屬偵查飛機二架，於梅縣被迫降落，於渝軍陣地，有馬少將獲報後，即盡夜不寐，苦思營救之計，除派機於上空投以糧食武器，以事接濟外，井電（天龍）以機戰余至（神州）共商辦法，當時欲親自與余共飛梅縣援救，部下井擬該地渝方長官直接對中日問題有所談論，旋恐此事不能順利進行，始密派部爲潛赴該地從事極救，由此可見有馬少將對部下愛護之程度。其以中國軍隊視同兄弟更值得吾人所欽佩，此次竟不惜犧牲，以機向敵美航空母艦猛沖自爆，殺身成仁之精神，更堪爲吾人所讚頌。</p>
<h3>訪問冀東特寫</h3>
<p>自第一版轉來　　三姜行政長一夕談　　見到了姜行政長，他似乎是一位年當力壯的實幹的份子。在華北軍政界中，他毫無疑義地是一位傑出的人才。他以前是日本陸大卒業，一向在東北軍界服務，事變後爲綏靖軍的一位幹部人才。他雖然到冀東來任行政長還不到三個月，可是他一經蒞任就大刀闊斧地去幹了。他曾經在蒞任後不久，就到各蒞去親察，且與各蒞紳商舉行座談會，親訪民隱。因此當他到臨檢縣去的時候，就有幾位八路軍的幹部携械來歸。在八月下句的時候，大概是八月二十四日　，冀東特別區還在姜行政長召集之下，開過一次全去的民眾代表大會。爲什麽要召開這個會呢？據姜行政長說，乃是因爲要使全區民眾脫出匪徒的誘惑，而使全區素負重望的士紳毫無忌憚地述說民間的隱痛，俾他們行政當局研究拯救的方策。我當時就想，這個舉動不問它的實際情形如何，在和平區域究　創舉。華北方面，如能以新政試驗爲模範，逐漸把它推廣到全國，筆者很相信匪徒有絕跡的一天。　　看上去，冀東當局是正在用其全力於庸清貪污，所以在姜行政長就職的一天，他就以唐山行營主任與行政長的資格，發表告冀東各地綏靖軍全體將士書。其中有數段坦白的陳詞，實在是近年來當局不可多得的自我檢討。他曾說：（：我軍以言討伐則經年累月，不眠不休，不但匪跡未清，而且變本加厲，尤其原因乃在乎各部隊將士奮勇苦戰者固多，而藉辭剔抉，致失民眾信賴者實非鮮見。考我軍在駐軍或行軍之際，往往由於搜索警戒之疏忽，或對敵觀念之薄弱，迨至被敵伏擊，又不能奮戰殺敵，反而嫁罪於民眾，指爲通匪濟匪，恣意剔抉，甚至由於功利心盛，不擇手段，加以侮辱或暴行，因之善良百姓，不懼共匪之來襲，而怕軍警之剔抉！）因之，他說：（我軍無論官佐士兵夫倘有藉端勒索，擅取民物者，或其它一切對民眾之非法行爲，除由行營隨時縝密調查嚴重法辦外，並准許商民據實控告，對該不良份子立即以軍方從事。）由此可知，姜氏於下馬之初，即如何告誡其部隊，且亦可見其善化特區政治決心之一斑了。現在特區駐屯的綏靖軍，約有五集團軍，每一集團軍包括三個團，該實即五師之眾。　　最後還有一點可以一說的，便是冀東特區的財政狀況。據姜行政長說，本年度的預算統共爲一千二百多萬元，數目雖小，但以他們蒞任伊始還有仗華北政委會的補助，大概明年度爲始便可奠定堅實的經濟基礎了。照他們先下所計劃的財政方案，乃是把田賦一律改寫畝捐，而對其它苛雜一律取消。他們所計劃的畝捐，半數納稅，半數征實，其徵稅之多寡，則一律視其田畝實況而定，凡屬於上等田者，每畝捐十五元，納物五斤，凡屬中等田者，每畝捐十二元，納物四斤，凡屬下等田者，每畝捐十元，納物三斤。至於苛雜一律撤銷，更包括過去各縣各鄉之擁款在內，蓋過去因政費不足，往往各縣各鄉可自主摊款。　　記者在唐山雖僅有六小時的勾留，但對於冀東當局上下一心的埋頭苦幹精神，十分表示欽佩。不過感到他們對經濟方面，尚未能與政軍二方形成一體，似爲美中之不足耳。因爲照目前情形而論，今日支配冀東物資的團體，還是和別的華北區域一樣，有纖維總會，油料協會，合作專業總會，董席協會，棉產改進會和麻產改進會等，而並沒有造成一個全權統制經濟的機關！記者深望他們能更進一步，達到其全體政治之目標，則冀東明朗化的前途，自將盆形光芒萬丈吧！　　昨發報時間六點四十五分</p>

        <h1>1944 - n294</h1>
<h3>The Essence of Control</h3>
<p>The purpose of wartime control is to manage resources and strive for the early attainment of victory in war. The method of control is, on the one hand, to conserve materials and eliminate even the slightest waste, and on the other hand, to increase production to replenish the necessary consumption of war. For the soldiers fighting on the battlefield, it is necessary to continuously supply the necessary materials so that they can strive for war without being affected by material problems. For the citizens who are not on the battlefield and do not directly participate in the war, it is necessary to stabilize their basic living conditions so that they can exert their maximum production power, and then be able to continuously increase production and continuously supply the needs of the entire front and rear. Therefore, the most ideal effect of wartime control is that the soldiers at the front and the people at the rear can live the simplest life, cooperate and divide labor, the front kills the enemy and achieves results, the rear strives to increase production, and the entire nation is like a machine, and the strength of the people is uniform and concentrated. Germany and Japan have been the most successful in wartime control. After suffering a great loss from the economic blockade during the last World War, Germany was even more meticulous this time. Since 1939, almost all the people in the country have had food to eat and work to do. The government wants to ensure that everyone has food to eat and must work. The government will never allow those who can work to reduce their ability to work due to living difficulties, and will never allow factories that can produce to reduce their production due to problems such as power and raw materials. For those who work, the necessities of life are allocated to them, and for the factories that work, the power and raw materials are allocated to them. Therefore, the products produced from the factories are also managed by the state. Under detailed planning, military and daily necessities are supplied to the front and rear respectively. In this cycle, the soldiers have food to eat and military weapons to fight, the people have food to eat and work to do, there are no idle people in the country, and no barren land, and they can be sure of winning any long-term war. Such a control system requires the government to have long-term preparations before the war. As for China, it is pitiful to say that there was no preparation before the war, and no adjustment after the war. The current control system has not been able to achieve the ideal goal, and it is even more likely to cause a bad impression on many people. Take Shanghai as an example, there are so many people, but it has not been possible to ensure that everyone has a job. And for those who have a job, if they rely entirely on rations and do not think of ways to get things from the black market, survival is impossible. There are so many factories in Shanghai, but it has not been possible for every factory to start work. And for factories that can start work, although their products can be sold freely, if they are sold entirely according to the price limit, it will definitely not be enough to cover the cost of power, raw materials, labor, etc. Everything is just a contradiction and just an opportunity for bad people to take advantage of. The entire control method urgently needs to be adjusted immediately, otherwise the future is unimaginable. This is not杞人憂天, but a factual and inevitable result.</p>
<h3>### Japanese Air Force Fiercely Bombs Enemy Fleet in Leyte Gulf</h3>
<h3>New Japanese Warplanes Appear on the Front Lines in a Steady Stream</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese fleet braved adverse weather on the 19th to launch a strong attack on Leyte Gulf, sinking two enemy battleships and one destroyer. During the attack on the 20th, the Japanese army used a joint fleet of fighters and bombers to brave the adverse weather and fiercely bombed the enemy aircraft carrier group near Suluan Island at around 8:00 a.m., destroying two enemy aircraft carriers. At around 4:00 p.m., they again sank a large enemy transport ship and destroyed another transport ship in Leyte Gulf.</p>
<p>A Certain Base in the South Pacific, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese rear production line is now actively manufacturing aircraft day and night. The sound of this fierce air battle will have a great impact on the next line. Now, the newest warplanes are being sent to the front lines one after another. All the Japanese frontline soldiers and officers are overjoyed. The achievements of the production line cannot be erased when they are continuously striking the British and Americans. The new Japanese warplanes currently available are the essence of the Japanese scientific community and have the speed and performance of the American B-29 Superfortress. The new Japanese warplane formations are rushing into the high sky in a majestic manner. They have the power to destroy the enemy and achieve great results in every engagement with the enemy. Therefore, the officers and soldiers at the forefront of the Japanese army are unanimously expressing their gratitude to the industrial soldiers who produce these new warplanes.</p>
<h3>### Japanese Military Expert</h3>
<h3>Discusses the Battle Situation in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese military expert Mr. Ito Seito discussed the American attack on the Philippines and stated that the great naval battle in Taiwan can be compared to the attack on Pearl Harbor, and its content is also similar. In 1941, when the American army fought and served as the main attacking force, the Japanese army wiped out more than 50% of it in one fell swoop. In 1944, when the American army used aircraft carriers as the main attacking force, Japan destroyed its central force in one fell swoop on the sea off Taiwan, inflicting heavy damage on its main force. Although this is the same as the Pearl Harbor attack in terms of value, it is different in terms of conditions because it is different in offense and defense. From the perspective of the overall strategic situation, the United States is in a defensive position in terms of tactics. Therefore, the counterattack that began after Pearl Harbor required a long period of preparation. However, recently, for the entire tactical offensive system, although it suffered a major defeat in the air and sea battle in Taiwan, it still attacked the Philippines within a certain period of time. The enemy's continuous offensive is what Japan has been seeking. The battle situation has already reached a major stage. When the foundation for victory is consolidated, another great victory is achieved, which is truly gratifying. What the enemy Americans are thinking about is also the future operations. After another setback in the sea off Taiwan, the overall battle situation has already shown signs of defeat.</p>
<h3>### Sea Area off the Nicobar Islands</h3>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Battle Results</h3>
<h3>Remarks by a Staff Officer of a Certain Unit</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base on the Front Lines, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese air force launched a preemptive offensive against the enemy British mobile force in the sea area off the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean, sinking and destroying a total of four ships. The Japanese Headquarters announced this battle result on the 20th. Later, the detailed process of the operation was clarified, and it was announced in the form of a staff officer's remarks from a certain unit on the 23rd as follows: After the American mobile force invaded Leyte Gulf, the British mobile force approached the Japanese Nicobar Islands the closest on the 17th at Kani Nicobar Island. However, a certain Japanese air force unit boldly dispatched on the 19th and achieved a great victory by destroying one enemy aircraft carrier and one destroyer. The battle situation was very fierce. The Japanese unit was tasked with destroying this enemy force. On the 19th, a fighter squadron advanced to the vicinity of Kani Nicobar Island. Before the start of the operation, the deployment status of the enemy mobile force was roughly as follows: ○ A group of one cruiser and two destroyers was advancing westward in the sea area 15 miles southeast of Kani Nicobar Island. ○ One battleship or cruiser was stationed 20 kilometers south of Kani Nicobar Island, shelling Kani Nicobar Island. ○ One strike force of one battleship and six destroyers was advancing in its western and eastern directions. ○ One strike force of one Indian Midaburu-class aircraft carrier, one battleship, and three cruisers or destroyers was advancing southward from the sea area 20 kilometers southwest of Kani Nicobar Island. The Japanese aircraft flew to the enemy airspace southeast of Kani Nicobar at around 12:00 on that day. After discovering the enemy forces in the clouds, they immediately attacked them. At that time, about 20 enemy fighters suddenly attacked from the front. Although the Japanese air force had various unfavorable conditions in terms of altitude and maneuverability, they bravely engaged the enemy in combat. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, they shot down four enemy aircraft, and another seven were unconfirmed, for a total of 11 aircraft shot down. It was also confirmed that one enemy cruiser or destroyer caught fire and sank. At that time, the Japanese Abe squadron had flown to the uppermost airspace. Although the squadron leader's aircraft was unable to confirm it, according to what was determined on the ground from Kani Nicobar Island, the Japanese aircraft discovered the enemy aircraft at around 12:20 on that day and immediately launched an aerial battle. They then disengaged from the enemy aircraft's attack and descended to a low altitude. Three aircraft approached the enemy mobile force with all their might. It initially appeared to be Lieutenant Abe's aircraft, which used a warplane to dive and descend directly towards the enemy Indian Midaru-class enemy aircraft carrier. The fuselage was carrying torpedoes and bravely collided with the enemy aircraft carrier. In an instant, it was surrounded by black smoke. When the black smoke dissipated, the silhouette of the 27,000-ton enemy aircraft carrier disappeared from the sea. The second aircraft of the Abe squadron similarly collided with an enemy destroyer, sinking it. The third aircraft continued to advance from the southeast and crashed into the enemy with a fierce impact, causing it to be heavily damaged. Thus, this fighter established the great feat of sinking an enemy aircraft carrier. As such, the Japanese army only used one fighter of several tons to sink an enemy aircraft carrier, which was something they never dreamed of.</p>
<h3>### Japanese Front Lines in Guangxi Province</h3>
<h3>Heard Bombing Sounds in Lingchuan</h3>
<p>Guangxi Front Lines, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The elite Japanese troops on the Guangxi front have been attacking blindly in the rain for days. In the past week, bombing sounds from the direction of Lingchuan and the north of Guilin could be heard from the first line, and smoke screens were seen rising. It is known that the Chongqing army seems to have decided to abandon Lingchuan, so they are destroying the military facilities and important institutions inside and outside the city.</p>
<h3>### Japanese Army Ministry Announces Commendations for Two Air Squadrons</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 23rd that the Army Commander had recently awarded commendations to the Sabang Air Dispatch Unit and the Shimada Air Unit, respectively, as follows:</p>
<p>1. Sabang Air Dispatch Unit Commendation: Under the command of Army Captain Yoshiichi Hiasa, the right dispatch unit was responsible for patrolling the Indian Ocean. On July 25th of this year, when an enemy mobile force attacked near Sabang, the squadron leader's aircraft was engaged in patrolling and did not miss the opportunity to report its situation, ensuring the complete preparedness of the Japanese army and navy units in that area. At the same time, while continuing to patrol and discovering an enemy submarine at sea, they used a heroic and courageous spirit to carry out fierce anti-aircraft gun fire, spewing out explosive flames, and finally sinking it, completing the heroic death of the entire team. In addition, Lieutenant Ono's aircraft did not allow other enemy submarines at sea any leeway to submerge, ensuring that all the bombs dropped hit their target and sank them. In addition, the ground maintenance personnel quickly repaired the aircraft and airports that were damaged by bombs under enemy air raids and shelling, enabling the aerial combat power to be fully exerted. The above actions were the result of the dispatch unit members, with the squadron leader as the center, upholding the great spirit of unity between air and land, and fully exerting the spirit of aerial combat power without regret. Their military achievements are outstanding, and this commendation is hereby awarded.</p>
<p>2. Shimada Air Unit Commendation: Under the leadership of Army Captain Saburo Shimada, the Shimada Air Unit engaged in maritime protection operations in northern Australia from 1943 to early August 1944, repeatedly achieving outstanding results and inflicting heavy damage on enemy submarines that threatened Japanese transport convoys. According to the records, the unit engaged in maritime operations in northern Australia a total of 8,008 times. Over 300 Japanese transport ships were protected by it. It also frequently gave full play to its reconnaissance capabilities, ambushing enemy ships and achieving the results of sinking seven enemy ships and destroying three. It completed the task of protecting the convoys, and its contribution to the preparations for operations in the northern Australian area was extremely profound and significant. In particular, Unit Leader Shimada was able to use his outstanding skills to personally lead the troops at the front lines and command the operations, personally sinking two enemy submarines. On July 28, 1944, he encountered twelve enemy F38 aircraft over Amahai Bay. The squadron leader's aircraft engaged them for 30 minutes before heroically sacrificing himself. However, the morale of the unit became even more vigorous, and on April 8 of the same year, they achieved the result of sinking another enemy submarine. This can truly be said to be due to the enlightened leadership of the unit leader, who was able to create a strong unity and a growing spirit with the unit leader as the center. Therefore, his military achievements are truly worthy of immortality, and this commendation is hereby awarded. August 22, 1945, Japanese Army Commander.</p>
<p>3. Army soldiers Kojima Fumio and Aso Bishu have repeatedly engaged in operations to protect important transportation routes in the waters of northern Australia, where enemy submarines have been rampaging fiercely, and have sunk many enemy submarines since November 1943. When the enemy forces began landing on Halmahera and Morotai Islands on September 15, 1944, the two soldiers dedicated themselves to air combat as squadron leader's staff aircraft on the 16th and discovered an enemy cruiser heading north near the waters off Morotai. They immediately launched an attack, and the first bomb hit the stern of the warship. At the same time, they themselves were also injured. They then crashed into the vital part of the enemy warship, causing it to explode and burn, and then sacrificed themselves heroically. This was entirely due to their lofty ideal of serving the country loyally, which enabled them to demonstrate their great spirit of sacrifice. This commendation is hereby awarded to commend them.</p>

<p>Berlin, 244th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Huitong News Agency: South of Gumbinnen, German tank units have encircled the main Soviet tank force and at least three infantry divisions, and are in the process of annihilating them.

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Budapest correspondent of this newspaper (Mainichi Shimbun) reported on the establishment of the Szálasi government in Hungary as follows: October 15 was a day of great turmoil in Hungary. At 1:00 p.m., the regular broadcast suddenly stopped, and Regent Horthy's proclamation was read out, stating that the Hungarian government, in view of the Soviet attack, had sought to replenish a million troops from the German army in order to defend the country, but the German army had not implemented it. Therefore, the government had decided to enter into peace negotiations with the enemy. At this point, the entire country of Hungary fell into chaos. Later, a group of people who opposed peace shouted the name of Ferenc Szálasi, the Arrow Cross leader, and the sound of resistance filled the streets and alleys. At that time, the peace faction occupied the royal palace, and the Arrow Cross leader began to exert his power, armed suppression, and regarded the regent and the peace faction as national enemies and arrested them. A few hours after the Regent's proclamation was broadcast, at the 8:00 p.m. special broadcast, the Arrow Cross leader Szálasi's broadcast announced to the people that the battle for Hungary's honor was still beginning, order was restored, and the people's hearts were stabilized. The new Prime Minister Szálasi is the most fierce opponent of the United States and leads the people to unite with Germany to eliminate the bad situation left over from the past in Hungary and move towards the construction of a new order.</p>

<h3>Special Report on a Visit to Eastern Hebei</h3>
<p>I. The Strategic Significance of the Eastern Hebei Special District</p>
<p>Speaking of Eastern Hebei, it shouldn't be an unfamiliar term! Before the Incident, a so-called "Anti-Communist Autonomous Government" was established there, encompassing twenty-one counties and known as the "Switzerland of the East" at the time. Following the Tongzhou Incident, the "government" dissolved, and after the establishment of the Provisional Government, the Dao Yin system of the past "Beijing Government" era was restored. Now, the newly established Eastern Hebei Special District in North China is largely the former Eastern Hebei Dao, but its scope is smaller than the previous Anti-Communist Government, as the Special District only includes ten counties and one city of the Eastern Hebei Dao, with Tangshan as its capital.</p>
<p>Tangshan is also a familiar city, not only because Tangshan Jiaotong University was once located there, but also because it is the center of the Kailuan Coal Mine. The Kailuan Mining Bureau is still there, and its employees are the envy of ordinary North China civil servants. This is because, for the lowest-ranking employees of the Kailuan Mining Bureau, the salary is 3,000 yuan, and they receive a bag of flour and one ton of coal per month. As for middle-level employees, the salary reaches 5,000 to 7,000 or 8,000 yuan, and they receive two to three bags of flour and about three tons of coal per month. The benefits for senior officials are, of course, even better, and their treatment can be described as the envy of all in North China. Therefore, in North China, no matter what military-managed enterprise or Sino-Japanese joint venture, their employees cannot compare with those of Kailuan! Because of the Kailuan Coal Mine, Tangshan can attract a large number of workers, so the market is very prosperous, and recently many roads have been renovated, with the bustling roads mostly paved with cement.</p>
<p>That Eastern Hebei has such a capital is of course very significant. Especially in the era of increasing production to win the war, Eastern Hebei, as the most affluent area in North China, enjoys the reputation of being a "granary" and includes this coal mining center, so its strategic mission will naturally increase. However, as the Communists eyed North China, Eastern Hebei was regarded as an important area for activity. Therefore, the North China Political Affairs Commission, in order to prevent problems before they arise, resolutely abolished the Dao system and established the Special District this summer (July). The so-called Special District differs from the former Dao in two characteristics: it is directly under the North China Political Affairs Commission, and it combines the total power of the military, government, and people to establish a new system for good governance. Today, Major General Jiang Fengfei, the first Administrative Director of the Eastern Hebei Special District, concurrently serves as the Director of the Tangshan Camp of the General Headquarters of the North China Pacification Army, so under this new system of military-political integration, its political future can naturally be expected to become brighter.</p>
<p>II. A Glimpse of Tangshan in Six Hours</p>
<p>Before the reporter came, I had intended to go to Tangshan to inspect this experiment of the new governance in North China, so I asked my old friend Chen Banhou (the current Secretary-General of the Pacification Commissioner's Office) to introduce me to the authorities in Eastern Hebei. The only characteristic of the new politics implemented in Eastern Hebei is the unification of the military and the government, and the authorities responsible for implementing the administration are mostly former members of the Pacification Commissioner's Office or the Pacification Army. Therefore, I was able to get all the assistance I needed there without any difficulty.</p>
<p>From Tianjin to Tangshan, it only takes three hours by express train, and even by slow train, it only takes four hours. It is still a light journey, especially as passengers can see the Toyota near Tanggu along the way, and three hours seems too short. Traveling in North China is indeed much easier than in the South. If you take a first-class or second-class ticket, I can guarantee that the comfort is the same as before the war. Here, there are none of the difficulties encountered in the South, such as buying tickets on the black market, crowding to get tickets, or even various undue demands. However, what impressed me most strongly during the journey was that most male passengers wore brown national uniforms or other uniforms, and most female passengers wore short clothes. This is because the railway authorities here stipulate that both men and women must wear air-raid clothing during the journey. The so-called air-raid clothing is that everything short can be applied, except for the prescribed style. Therefore, in the train, women wearing cheongsams can be said to be extremely rare.</p>
<p>The streets of Tangshan have been very tidy recently. After the reporter arrived at the station at noon, I hired a rickshaw to tour the city for a week. The most bustling areas are Guangdong Street, Pianyi Street, and the New Market area. The reporter drank alone in the Xiaotaoyuan Restaurant in the New Market. Prices in Tangshan are generally cheaper than in Tianjin. The reporter ordered half a catty of white liquor, a cold dish (white chicken and preserved egg), a plate of fried liver, and twenty dumplings in Xiaotaoyuan, spending only forty-eight yuan. Because of the low prices, according to the waiter, most of the materials here flow to Tianjin. On the day the reporter went to Tangshan, all sectors were busy preparing for the Mid-Autumn Festival. The Special District Administrative Office was holding a Mid-Autumn Festival farmers' celebration, and special efforts were being made to suppress prices. Now I will briefly report some simple prices. For food, rice is twelve yuan per catty, and flour is seven yuan and five jiao per catty. For meat, mixed crabs are nine yuan per catty, large prawns are twenty-six yuan per catty, carp is twenty yuan per catty, live chickens are twenty-seven yuan each, goose eggs are one yuan and three jiao each, tomatoes are three yuan and two jiao per catty, eggplants are one yuan and six jiao per catty, potatoes are two yuan and two jiao per catty, pork is twenty-one yuan per catty, beef and mutton are twenty-two yuan per catty, Guangdong mooncakes are sixty yuan per catty, and for wine, a large bottle of Shaoyang wine here sells for twenty yuan, and a small bottle sells for ten yuan.

<h3>Chongqing Army's Counterattack on Longling Fails</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from the Nujiang Front Line, 24th: After the Chongqing army, at great sacrifice, finally recaptured Lameng and captured two major fortresses of Jingyue, it poured in the main force of the 9th Division of the Nanda Expeditionary Force and launched a fierce attack on the strategic stronghold of Longling. Upon the Japanese army's counterattack, it collapsed. It is currently engaged in reinforcing its strength and weapons. The Japanese army in Longling received reinforcements of fresh troops on August 27th, broke through the encirclement of the Chongqing army, and counterattacked with other friendly forces. The Chongqing army built Lameng, and the Chongqing army from Yueyue southward concentrated in the northern area of Longling. Due to excessive consumption and no counterattack, the second and third lines of defense were built.</p>
<h3>Official Gazette Extra Publishes Japanese Prime Minister's Instructions to Government Officials to Set an Example for the People</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 24th: Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, in response to the brave battles of the soldiers on the front lines, especially requested that government officials set an example for the national people and take the lead in rising up. He published the Cabinet's instructions in the official gazette extra on the 23rd. The main points are as follows: I. Official duties have a great influence on the victory or defeat of the war, so officials should serve with sincerity and set an example in their actions and behavior, thereby inspiring the general public's belief in victory. Without a fair and upright heart, even playing with beautiful words is difficult to move the heart. Therefore, officials should clearly show the fundamental spirit of taking the lead in setting an example, especially primary officials and local officials who are close to the people should pay special attention to the points. II. Laws and regulations are dead documents, and the skill of their operation lies in the heart. If national urgent matters are to be implemented, etc., it is also possible not to adhere to trivial matters. In order to implement wartime service, efforts should be made to simplify affairs. III. The promotion of social morality is the beautiful tradition of Japan. The decline of social morality in wartime is a common practice in all belligerent countries. Therefore, officials who are public servants of the country should do their utmost to prevent the deterioration of trends. At the same time, they should be open-minded, insightful, and perceive the subtle mechanisms of human feelings, so that officials and people can cooperate and move together towards the path of victory.</p>

If there are no parking lines or other signs at the intersection, the pedestrian crosswalk line shall prevail. III. The main task of the (Traffic Safety) Service Team is to assist in guiding people to comply with (traffic safety) rules, so they must be amiable and sincere in dealing with the people, and avoid unnecessary disputes in particular. IV. The duties of directing or managing traffic at each intersection are still the responsibility of the traffic police of the respective branch bureau in charge. Members of the (Traffic Safety) Service Team do not need to participate. V. When performing their tasks, members of the (Traffic Safety) Service Team should wear a white armband with red characters (Safety First) and a number issued by the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau on their left arm to identify them. The armband should be distributed and kept by the captains of each brigade. VI. When performing their tasks, if members of the (Traffic Safety) Service Team encounter cases of traffic violations or accidents, they should hand them over to the nearest police officer or branch bureau for handling. VII. Service dates are from October 26th to November 1st. Time: A shift: 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM, 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM. B shift: 11:45 AM to 12:45 PM, 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM. VIII.

<h3>Major General Arima Fought Bravely and Sacrificed Himself, Minister Matsushima Expressed Deep Condolences</h3>
<p>In this aerial operation in the eastern waters of the Philippines, Japanese commander Major General Arima Kenbun took the lead in battle, charging towards the enemy fleet in his plane and perishing together with an enemy American aircraft carrier. Minister Matsushima of the Press Section of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, who had been trained by Major General Arima, especially published his thoughts yesterday: (Major General Arima was from the Satsuma region of Kyushu and had a very kind appearance. At first glance, one would never expect the major general to be a heroic warrior. His strict father was an educator. When we entered military school, Major General Arima served as an instructor and provided very strict guidance to us. The major general, who came from an artillery background, switched to aviation in Showa 12 and repeatedly established military achievements. When Guangzhou was captured, one of his subordinates' planes was forced to land midway. The major general stepped forward to rescue him. At that time, Jiang Ruzhou, the general manager of the Sanmin Trust Company, who helped with the rescue, also expressed deep admiration for the major general's kindness and bravery. The last time I received Major General Arima's care was in the spring of Showa 15, when I was ordered to transfer to the Yokosuga Naval Base as the Director of the Press. The major general, as the deputy commander of the air wing, gave a very detailed explanation of the content of the new aircraft and the spirit of the Japanese naval air wing, with the utmost sincerity. Major General Arima, who adhered to the spirit of perseverance and indomitability, now perishes together with the enemy aircraft carrier, which can also be said to be a fulfillment of his aspirations. In military school, I often heard the major general's admonition (Matsushima-kun, please be mindful of this. I still remember it to this day.)</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Ruzhou Published His Thoughts</p>
<p>Since the enemy Americans began to stir in the Philippines, the Allied Japanese forces met them head-on and inflicted heavy damage, creating this brilliant achievement. Major General Arima, the commander of a unit in its air force, heroically sacrificed himself by exploding his plane. His friend Wang Ruzhou specially published his thoughts on this: In Showa 13, when Arima was the Chief Staff Officer of the (Tenryu) warship, I served on the warship. He usually treated people kindly and was especially concerned about the Sino-Japanese issue. He deeply believed that China and Japan, with the same script and race, should not engage in domestic strife and hoped that people from both countries would work together for the future of our East Asian nations. Later, he was promoted to captain of the (Shinshu) warship, and we separated. I remember that when the warship was operating in the south, it was anchored outside Shantou River. Two reconnaissance planes belonging to it were forced to land in Meixian, in the territory of the Chongqing army. After receiving the report, Major General Arima did not sleep all night, thinking hard about how to rescue them. In addition to sending planes to drop food and weapons from the air to provide assistance, he also telegraphed (Tenryu) to fly to (Shinshu) to discuss solutions together. At that time, he wanted to personally fly to Meixian with me to rescue them. His subordinates also planned to discuss Sino-Japanese issues directly with the local Chongqing commander. However, fearing that this matter would not proceed smoothly, he secretly dispatched his subordinates to sneak into the area to engage in extreme rescue. From this, it can be seen to what extent Major General Arima loved his subordinates. It is even more admirable that he regarded the Chinese army as brothers. This time, he spared no expense to sacrifice himself, charging towards the enemy American aircraft carrier and exploding his plane, his spirit of sacrificing himself for righteousness is even more worthy of our praise.</p>
<h3>Special Report on a Visit to Eastern Hebei</h3>
<p>Continued from the first page.</p>
<p>Three: An Evening Talk with Administrative Chief Jiang.</p>
<p>Meeting Administrative Chief Jiang, he seemed to be a vigorous and practical person in his prime. In North China's military and political circles, he is undoubtedly an outstanding talent. He graduated from the Japanese Army War College and had always served in the Northeast Army. After the incident, he became a key cadre in the Pacification Army. Although he has been in Eastern Hebei as Administrative Chief for less than three months, he has been working vigorously since taking office. Soon after taking office, he went to various places to inspect in person, held symposiums with gentry and merchants, and personally visited the people's concerns. Therefore, when he went to Linjian County, several Eighth Route Army cadres surrendered with their weapons. Around August 24th, in the latter part of August, under the call of Administrative Chief Jiang, a general assembly of people's representatives from all over the Eastern Hebei Special District was held. Why was this meeting convened? According to Administrative Chief Jiang, it was to free the people of the entire district from the temptation of bandits and to allow the respected gentry to speak without reservation about the hidden pains of the people, so that the administrative authorities could study rescue strategies. I thought at the time that, regardless of the actual situation, this move was an initiative in a peaceful area. If North China can use the experiment of new governance as a model and gradually promote it to the whole country, the writer firmly believes that the bandits will one day disappear. It seems that the Eastern Hebei authorities are putting all their efforts into eliminating corruption and bribery. Therefore, on the day Administrative Chief Jiang took office, in his capacity as Director of the Tangshan Military Camp and Administrative Chief, he issued a letter to all officers and soldiers of the Pacification Army in Eastern Hebei. Several frank statements in it are indeed rare self-examinations by the authorities in recent years. He said: "Our army has been talking about suppression for years, without rest, but not only have the bandits not been cleared, but they have become more rampant. The main reason is that while many officers and soldiers are fighting bravely and hard, there are also not a few who make excuses for extorting, which causes the loss of public trust. When our army is stationed or marching, it is often due to negligence in searching and guarding, or a weak concept of the enemy, that they are ambushed by the enemy. They cannot fight bravely to kill the enemy, but instead blame the people, accusing them of communicating with and aiding the bandits, and extorting arbitrarily, even resorting to insults or violence for the sake of profit. As a result, good people are not afraid of the Communist bandits, but are afraid of the extortion of the military and police!" Therefore, he said: "If any of our officers, soldiers, or servants extort on the grounds of their position, take people's property without authorization, or commit any other illegal acts against the people, in addition to the Military Camp conducting thorough investigations and severely punishing them at any time, merchants and people are also allowed to truthfully accuse them. These bad elements will be immediately dealt with by the military." From this, we can see how Jiang warned his troops from the beginning of his tenure, and also see his determination to improve the politics of the special district. Currently, there are about five Group Armies of the Pacification Army stationed in the Special District, each Group Army including three regiments, which is actually the strength of five divisions. Finally, there is one more thing worth mentioning, which is the financial situation of the Eastern Hebei Special District. According to Administrative Chief Jiang, the total budget for this year is more than 12 million yuan. Although the amount is small, with the assistance of the North China Political Affairs Committee at the beginning of their tenure, a solid economic foundation can probably be laid starting next year. According to their current financial plan, the land tax will be uniformly changed to a mu (unit of area) donation, and other miscellaneous taxes will be abolished. Their planned mu donation will be half paid in cash and half in kind. The amount of tax will be determined based on the actual condition of the land. For top-quality land, the donation is 15 yuan per mu and 5 catties (unit of weight) of goods. For medium-quality land, the donation is 12 yuan per mu and 4 catties of goods. For low-quality land, the donation is 10 yuan per mu and 3 catties of goods. The abolition of all miscellaneous taxes also includes past funds owned by various counties and townships, because in the past, due to insufficient government funding, various counties and townships could independently apportion funds. Although the reporter only stayed in Tangshan for six hours, he expressed great admiration for the spirit of hard work and unity of the Eastern Hebei authorities. However, it is felt that they have not been able to integrate the economic aspect with the political and military aspects, which seems to be a slight deficiency. Because, according to the current situation, the groups that control the materials of Eastern Hebei today are still the same as other regions in North China, with the Fiber Association, the Oil Association, the Cooperative Professional Association, the Board of Directors Association, the Cotton Production Improvement Association, and the Hemp Production Improvement Association, etc., and there is no organization that has full authority to control the economy! The reporter sincerely hopes that they can go further and achieve their overall political goals, then the bright future of Eastern Hebei will surely be even more glorious!</p>
