<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>敷衍</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>曾有人問我：「東亞形勢，如常此以往，中國人總不會積極參加戰爭的。英美式的享樂現象，仍然在上海方與未艾。中國的知識份子，為什麼目睹這樣亡國現狀，而不決然奮起呢？」不僅這位日本人，就是中國人中，也有很多人淋漓盡致地抨擊中國知識份子，對目前政治所採取的消極態度。在日本人間，相當風行着一稱議論：即，中國的且前政治，壞就讓它壞去，努力糾正這一點，是中國知識份子的責任，中國知識份子，只是袖手旁觀一般民衆的苦痛，而想目前政治的改善，實等於「期待百年河淸」。我也會對於這樣中國知識份子的態度，痛駡為「騎墻主義」，然而老實說，讓中國知識份子抱這種「騎墻主義」的一部份責任，同時也不能不歸　於日本人的態度。但我所以沒有要求日本人方面實行自我批判的原因，我想，稍加相索的人就會立刻瞭解的吧。孔子也曾說過：「不曰如之何，如之何者，吾末如之何也已矣」（衛靈公篇）對方只說自己要說的話，而無意商談「如之何，如之何」者，這樣人，甚至孔子也無辦法。質言之，實行「政策轉變」前，日本人間會盛行着一種傾向：即只說自己要說的話。會有很多日本人，關於中國問題並不想聽取中國人的意見，只把日本人的大東亞理念排揭出來，而造作中國人「必須如此這般」的觀念，凡不合乎此種觀念的中國人，即加以深惡痛絕，嚴厲打擊。因此，當時的中國知識份子，並不想和日本人在中國問題和東亞問迎上，作理論上的正面衝突，而認爲盡量不要惹出日本人的脾氣來，還是速一點躲開日本人的好。然而中國知識份子對於日本人，並不懷有不共戴天的民族痛恨，並不存有永久同仇敵愾的態度。因爲他們都知道，如無日本明治維新，則整個亞洲，早就成爲英美的殖民地了，同時因爲他們也瞭解，假定日本滅亡，對抗英美金融資本的攻擊，中國一國是絕對不能保持自已的獨立自由的。只在這一點上，他們是衷心願意協助日木的。既然需要協助，日本人就要以朋友的態度，充分聽取中國知識分子的意見。假如日本人肯以朋友的態度，聽取這樣中國的民族要求，我認爲中國知識份子，總是心悅誠服，開誠佈公地喜歡和日本人談。反過來說，假如日本入老是像一頭兇猛的莽牛一樣，只按自己的目標，胡衝亂撞，對於中國知識份子所說的話，總是以馬耳東風的態度應付，那末他們只有客客氣氣地讓道而過。因爲假如從正面與日本人進行理論鬥爭，這只有遭受當頭棒喝，與事無補，所以最好應付日木人的方法，就是敬而遠之。</p>
<p>中國人這種心理，我也很知道，我常常對於中國問題，打聽地位高權勢大的人的意見。我固然是沒有任何處理這一問題的權的一個人，但我知道中國問題是祖國命運所擊的重大問題，所以就熱心研究。職此之故，我不管對方是怎樣地位高權勢大的人物，都毫不客氣地想加以忠告和說服。然而對方假如是關於中國人的理解過於膚淺，且對自已的皮毛見解固執不放，而不聽取我話的人，我只有認爲自己晦氣。同時，我認爲對付這種日本人，最好盡量不觸犯他的脾氣，實行敬鬼神而遠之的政策，而只有强顏爲笑，機械地重覆一下對方的話。這種態度與精神，我認爲是中國知識份子應付日木人的獨善主義，或明哲保身的態度和精神。中國知識份子，對於這種態度和精神，是有最精彩表演的，與我們這樣笨伯是逈乎不同的。會國藩認爲，若遇外國人，當面侮辱時，則最善之方法，爲溫雅之笑，佯作不解彼言之痴態。受有這種敎育的中國人，認爲對方絕對不能以理喻的時候，則用「敷衍」方法來應付一切。這和日本話中的「應付」意義相同。然而有敎養的中國人，對於道種「應付」，在表面上決不表現出來，而是用極有禮貌，唯恭唯謹的方法表演出來，於是叫被「應付」的對方，感覺不出來是被「應付」·辜鴻銘分用謙恭的巧避術（Polite　evasiveness）這個名詞，來形容中國人這樣手法。中日兩國名流聚於一堂會餐時，往往我以翻譯員的資格忝居末席，然而令我驚訝和佩服不置老，爲中國的名流全都是運用「謙恭巧避術」之天才專家——在此處用老奸巨猾這個名詞，更爲恰當——。</p>
<p>在中國知識份子對目前政治的消極態度中，看不到中國人的謙恭巧避術，這只有盲者。假如中國知識份子是「敷衍」專家，則日本只有用「誠意」來對付這一點。因爲誠意不容許有任何欺騙性的。至於中國人爲何躲避日本人，這是由於他們相信日本人是不講理的。所以日本人在說自己耍說的話以前，必須先讓中國人說自己要說的話。此時，中國人說的話，縱或與日本人的意見根本不同，縱有令人髪指的地方，也不要立刻舉起手來，賞以老拳，而要以理論鬥爭說服對方，或被對方說服，總之，是要在理論上等求兩大民族間的共同「道理」。假如日本人能對中國人證明自己是瞭解道理的，那末中國知識份子就不會像躲牛一樣，悄悄地躲開日本人，同時一定還要進一步開始與日本人作正面的理淪鬥爭。這就是對中國知識份子消除政治消極態廣，進而使參加東亞政治的一個最好方法。（魯譯）</p>
<h3>日軍進攻阿薩密　哥希馬周圍血戰　雨季將臨敵補給益感困難</h3>
<p>仰光十三日中央社電　哥希馬地區之攻防戰，因雨季將臨，益趨熾列，敵軍爲阻止向迪馬普爾進攻之日軍及奪回哥希馬，以打通至伊姆法爾之輸血路起見，乃積極反攻，日軍一面與之邀擊，一面並向阿薩密積極進攻，於是哥希馬周圍遂演成血戰，現敵軍已陷於日軍之包圍中。同時被截斷退路及地上補給路之英軍四萬人，原僅藉空輸補給物資，茲因雨季降臨，空中補給受阻，而益感困難，故敵人唯二之希望，即打通伊姆法爾至迪馬普爾之公路·敵軍欲救援第四軍，除奪回哥希馬之外，則別無他途，因此，敵人自五月以來，遂積極反攻，不僅由吉大港及西龍（哥希馬西方）方面續行調遣軍隊，向迪馬普爾方面增援，且更由北方逐次將軍隊調至南方，以窺伺哥希馬。由迪馬普爾至哥希馬北方一帶之敵軍，除有前在士大港方面之第十五軍所部第五師及第四十四師之外，並配有機械化部隊之第四十二獨立坦克車隊等，此等兵力，均以哥希馬至迪馬普爾之公路爲中心，反復實行反攻。又茲布扎（哥希馬西北方十公里及吉特索曼札之間）北方之敵軍砲兵，爲支援固守四六需高地一角事，不分晝夜向日軍陣地猛射，同時並以優秀之步兵部隊及精說之空軍，向哥希馬西方四六零高地之南方地區及其東方五一二九高地等日軍陣地猛攻。又由莫克庫橋（哥希馬北方偏西九十公里）南下之敵軍，于納爾馬北方一帶蠢動，其中一部並潛入龍開茲密間之密林地帶，企圖擾亂日軍後方，然日軍各部隊，不但予敵軍以重創，且更加强對迪馬普爾之攻勢。</p>
<h3>敵輪型陣地　被衝破一角</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　據印度前綫電，巴列爾週邊之敵軍，現獲得瓦基（巴列爾北方十五公里）方面約一千兵力之增援，廣續竭力抵抗，日軍精說於八日拂曉派機進攻敵軍死守之公路南方先拿姆克·塔格拉姆·坎庫諾輸型陣地一角四五六二高地，破壞數條鐵網，開一突擊路，繼向該高地猛攻，即完全將其占領。又日軍另一部隊猛攻公路北方之薩巴姆（巴列爾東南九公里）要塞，將其控制，於是敵企圖最後抵抗之輸型陣地一角即被日軍衝破，而　伺其中央部。又巴列爾及公路東方各伊凌克飛機塲，基亞卡恩飛機塲之敵軍，憑恃堅固陣地抗戰中。日機於九日以來，連續加以轟炸，並於地上攻擊予以重創，敵軍卡車滿載傷兵，向伊姆法爾方面運送，巴列爾最後之凄厲戰况，由是可見一斑，日軍近獲增援後，現對此敗敵猛攻。</p>
<h3>日派興亞使節　伍堂氏抵滿</h3>
<p>新京十三日中央社電日本派遣訪滿興亞使節伍堂卓雄氏，十二日下午四時乘機安抵新京，預定滯滿十餘日，除於新京親訪各機關，懇談聯歡外，並擬往哈爾濱，馬鞍山各地遊歷，或開講演會，並考察各地實情，定二十六日離新京返國。</p>
<h3>中部太平洋　日態勢鞏固　敵機襲拉巴爾特魯克</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　太平洋方面戰局，於過去一兩週，雖依然在緊張空氣中，但未見有何等動向，此足蹬敵雖欲急進攻，而其實施行動漸已感受限制之悄况。日方於南方佔領地，使其一切資源均化爲戰力，積極生產戰爭用資材，反之，美國之軍需生產，現巳達於頂點，此實爲敵反攻企圖之一大陣礙。日本之實力仍着着增强，此適與彼等所想象者相反，例如此次日軍展開伊姆法爾作戰，同時，幷能發動大規模之作戰，是即日太實力雄厚之左證。中部太平洋方面日軍之態勢，今已日臻鞏固，日陸·海軍精銳，決可隨時隨地粉碎敵軍之蠢動。要之，太平洋方面戰局，無甚大推移，僅有敵方具有遊擊性之蠢動而已。現敵機動部隊集結於馬紹爾舉島，新幾內亞島北方海岸方面，仍擬乘隙岡進，茲誌該方面蠢動情形如次：　所羅門方面，拉巴爾仍爲敵機襲擊之中心，來襲機數過去每日爲九百架，今已減至百架，每次來襲時，爲日方守備隊擊洛擊毀者甚多，自五月六日迄入日止，共擊落敵機三十架，又日軍會於六日在聖特闌方面擊沉敵魚雷艇一艘，擊毀逐敵驅艦一艘。　新幾內亞方面，敵機時以二十架之數來襲，過去一週日軍曾在該方面擊落，擊毀敵機六架。　班達海方面，安波那，的糜爾等地，亦時有敵機數架至十餘架來襲，自五月四日至八日止，日軍繁落，擊毀敵機六架。　中部太平洋方面，敵機僅對波納爾，特魯克，美來庸，摩脫洛克及關島方面，仍作小規模之遊擊行動。</p>
<p>拉巴爾十三日中央社電　十日，十一日兩日，分有敵機百架來襲拉巴爾，該方面日軍當行逖擊，計十日擊落敵機五架，擊毀四架，十一日擊落兩架，日方無損失。</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　據中部太平洋日軍某基地電，十月上午有敵機約二十六架來襲特魯克島，爲日軍擊落三架，擊毀二架，日方損失輕微。</p>
<h3>英美聯合機隊　襲緬受重創</h3>
<p>仰光十三日中央社電　日戰鬥機隊，十二日下午接獲敵機來襲警報，即出動至某地區，與敵機P38型十二架，P51型十二架相遇，遂展開壯烈空戰，擊落敵機P51型七架（內不確實者四架），將其擊退。又於十一日來襲該地之敵機，係英·美戰鬥機運合編隊，於上　配置旋風式，中屢為北美型，最下層為洛基特P38型等機，分成三段陣形進攻，此為英·美軍之首次運合作戰，極値重視。最上層之英旋風式飛機八架，內五架被擊落，蒙受重創</p>
<h3>東條首相將闡述　「對時局之所信」　日總崛起大會今晨舉行</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日國民總崛起運動中央總會，定十四日上午八時在大政翼贊會·翼贊政治會之主辦下，假此間日此谷公會堂隆重舉行，屆時東條首相將以「對時局之所信」爲題，率直闡述爲擊減頑敵英·美，國內臣民應認淸現下情勢，於生產各方面努力以赴。出席該會者有翼贊會·翼政會及其他官吏，重要產業各方而等五十餘協力團體，共約五千餘名。會後並將選派代表，分赴伊勢神宮，明治神宮，作必勝祝禱。</p>
<h3>渝方反省之適當時期　江南隱士</h3>
<p>渝方湯恩伯部隊號稱爲勇敢善戰的鐵軍，但在河南前綫作戰，不到二十天就給日軍毫不費力地將其擊潰，日軍長驅直入佔領了六萬方哩的土地，此種戰績足使全世界大爲震驚。</p>
<p>反軸心方面現已承認日軍在各戰綫仍具有强大的潛力，一方面對重慶之領導者加以責雛，認爲重慶已不復能使人信任。要知渝軍在河南戰綫之失敗，實際係受英美兩國的欺騙，這一層重慶亟應中以反省。渝方明知軍力之所以薄弱，由於美國租軍之吝予援助，在豫省戰役中，湯恩伯軍隊蒙受重大犧牲，便是缺乏軍器所致。經此打擊，遂促使渝方有重行研究美國之所謂援助是否「出於誠意」一問題。蓋彼輩對美國早已表示不滿，甚至有人主張重行考慮對該國之態度者。大公報放五月十日社諭中稱，前年十月以後，美國根據租軍法，以其百分之四十供給英國，百分之二十一接濟蘇聯，而中國所得僅佔百分之二。太平洋戰局即將臨決定關頭，而重慶又爲東亞之重要國家，自應獲得美國更大的軍火援助云云。以上言論足以代表渝方不平之嗚。</p>
<p>渝方缺乏軍器</p>
<p>渝行政院發言人張平羣於本月十日招待外報記者席上，有人詢以「日軍在豫省之勝利，是否將使渝方請美國訓練其軍隊」？張氏當答的訓練，如果缺乏軍器，終不能制勝。現在渝軍既無坦克等重兵器，又處於不利的環境，以致蒙受重大的犧牲，吾人極盼協約國迅速予以援助，免致再遭慘敗。可是政府與人民確信眾火之接濟，端賴運輸之暢通運輸阻塞實爲目下最嚴重的問題。」蓋會際上現無運輸路可以直達重慶，無論渝方領袖大聲疾呼以求援，絡無充分軍火可得，其焦急心理，固不言可喻。再者美國之租軍法規定以物資償付，這可表明美國欲於戰後以殖民地視中國，不特此也，重慶已設有美國軍官監督之步兵訓練學校兩處，而在計擬設立中者尚有四校。中英混合組織之航空隊亦已成立。渝軍之武器配備且已爲美國式化。渝軍目前實無需此種訓練，而竟施之以美國化訓練，其政治上之企圖固如何耶？美國欲於戰後把握在華　權，殆無疑義矣。張傳士提及此點時實具有辛酸識刺之意。</p>
<p>重慶政權領袖，當知美國爲達到其在華之最後目的起見其所取之步　為如何。倘渝方領袖尚未憬悟美國之企圖者，則際此豫省前線戰事方殷，實為對於美國真正之企圖及動機，重加考慮之最適當時期也</p>

<h3>蘇浙皖各縣鎭鄕　徵兩項消費稅　稅務署呈准財部下週實施</h3>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　財政部稅務署，奉令自本年一月十六日起，於上海，南京，蘇州，鎮江，無錫，武進，丹陽，常熟，蕪湖，蚌埠，揚州，杭州，嘉興，紹典，寗波，等十五市縣，由各該地署屬稅務分支局，徽收物品零售及筵席旋館兩項消費特稅，數月於茲，成續甚佳。頃悉該署爲增加稅收，平均國民納稅義務，業已呈准財部，於本月十六日起，對蘇，浙，皖，三省市縣，已開徵消費特稅以外之縣鎮鄉村卡埠，普遍徵收上述兩項消費特稅。至關於以前各省財政廳起徽之消費特稅，自十六日起，概移歸該署所屬地方總務機關微收。至其他地區有未設立稅務機關者，將由該署委託省市縣政府代徵。</p>
<h3>登封東南日軍　縮小包圍圈　湯部被困喪失戰力</h3>
<p>新鄭十三日中央社電　日軍於登封東南業將湯恩伯軍包圍，邇來復逐之狀態。湯恩伯軍爲渝軍中之精銳，但自日軍開始黃河渡河作戰，及伏牛山脈包圍作戰以來，僅二旬餘。十七萬人已喪失戰力</p>
<p>新鄭十奪日中央社電　華北日軍各精銳部隊，於上月十八日大舉渡涉舊黃河及新黃河，而於河南大平原席捲湯恩伯麾下之蔣直系軍頑强之敗敵現已被困於伏牛山中。日軍另一部隊急追至許昌，奔逃之敗敵，沿京漢綫南下，使於郾城之强敵潰滅，而華中日軍精銳各部隊，則自武漢北上，擊散李宗仁麾下之第五戰區軍，陸績猛進。所向無敵之日軍，南北兩軍於本月九日遂相會於京漢綫之確山，於此武漠至華北之交通樞紐，業告完成，運輸兵力與進攻作戰均得自由，對敵之威脅已刻刻增大。</p>
<p>畑總司令抵達前綫</p>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍當局，十三日下午二時發表，畑總司令官爲指導河南方面作戰，已於五月八日，行抵華北方面河南戰綫。</p>
<p>漢口十三日中央社電　日華中軍爲呼應華軍之進攻，突於五月一日，對渝第五戰區戰開全面攻勢，李宗仁所部渝軍，未作何等抵抗，即告敗走。緣日軍自開始行動以來，僅數日已將某某兩地佔領，刻日軍仍向某某要衝猛進中，且有一部巳在確山與華北軍會師。</p>
<p>日機擊落來襲敵機</p>
<p>淡口十三日中央社電日軍航空部隊，十一日下午二時三十分，邀擊來襲洛陽東方之駐渝美空軍，戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊P40型機十一架，B25型機五架。同時日機〇架，並於垣曲澠池上空，予以圍擊。於展開激烈之空戰後，即整落其P40型機一架，但未經證實。是役日方毫無損失，安然返防</p>
<h3>軍會政治部迭破　渝共反動陰謀　半年來破婆案多起</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　軍事委員會政治部，自成立以來，業巳半載。各地工作人員，在部長黃自强，次長楊振及局長萬里浪胡均鶴領導之下，無不奮勉從公，埋頭苦幹，固定工作推進甚力，迭次破獲渝方及赤共反動份子之陰謀，及暗殺案件甚多。弭皇於無形，治安攸賴。上述案件除有一部份尚須偵察，未便發表外，茲將該部半年來破獲已結各案之人犯姓名地點槍支彈藥等，披霧於後：</p>
<p>渝諸暨縣自衛會整編委員會主任周破浪，收集渝方前諸暨縣自衛總隊敵兵隊一百五十名，整編爲特務大隊，配備輕機槍二挺，步槍三十餘枝，派陳岳良為大隊長，遂流竄於諸暨縣長濟·長和·普樂·及東平·各鄉，專事騷援地方，謀害我和運人員。最近據報，該內部因派別關係，發生裂痕，前自　總隊份子與周破浪嫡系人員，因待遇不均，互相歧視，勢如水火。二月底，敵果在某地火併，結果周之嫡系分隊長周友良，爲陳岳良戕殺，所屬士兵，各懷異志，携械逃散。其餘二十餘人，則皆係前「自衛總隊」奮人，因事已至此，進退維谷，陳某不得已，乃即率領該部潛至某地，徘徊瞻顧，意向未定。我方見事機成熟，遂於三月十一日拂曉，派工作同志二十五人，配備武器，向目的地冒雨疾馳。八時許到達，施以閃電式之包圍。其時敵人尚在睡夢中，因變生意外，猝不及防，自大隊長陳岳良以下二十三名，人械全部爲我俘獲，無一漏網。茲將俘擄渝特務大隊姓名，及繳獲槍枝彈藥等，分列於後：（一）俘據姓名陳岳良（大隊長）趙鐵山，洪槐水·（中隊長以何森（副官，）張一天（情報組長，）蔡祗·何春水，壽忠·何雄·宣鐵軍·（以上爲分隊長，）余福山·朱定才·（輕機槍手，）吳森。趙子有。王李才·張勇·張宰揚·（以上列兵，）周全品·郭良·（一等列兵）楊仁貴·郭洪山·（下十理長）陣賢。陳星亮·（傳達。）（二）繳獲彈藥槍枝，捷克式輕機槍一挺，中正式步槍十枝，二號木壳一枝，備補機槍筒一桿，彈來四只，壓彈器一只，子彈九百三十七發，刺刀一把，軍號一只。</p>
<p>渝忠救軍澄錫虞辦事處，敎導大隊爆破組組長沈一行，偕同組員張明生等三人，於上年十二月三日，携帶五磅熱水瓶及牛乳瓶各一只，內裝爆做材料，潛入無錫城中企圖於大東亞戰爭紀念日前伐，實施破壤工作，當於十二月七日予以逮捕，並搜獲炸藥二塊。</p>
<p>渝江浦縣政府調查組織長劉光華，奉爲縣長姚景涵之命，潛入京市，運輸械前往江北。當派員將該犯拘獲，並捕獲關係人犯劉金寶，萬祖康，二名。</p>
<p>渝　擊隊份子萬子良奉游擊隊第十縱隊第二支隊沿江大隊長楊泰貴令，潛八京市。收買手槍。經派員將該犯拘獲，並將關係人田疇·唐竹三·張大春·李瑞仁·劉永年·等五名，一併捕獲。</p>
<p>私運軍火犯施家盛·張仁聚等，在棲霞山外圍地方，私運炸藥過江資敵。當派員於十二月十五晚，將該二犯加以拘捕，並抄獲炸藥一百條。據稱「該項炸藥係由一名施家業者，一名洋船老大者，以十元一條購得，轉售赤匪營利。因施家業患病，故由彼等代爲裝運等語。當將人犯一併解往首都地方法院審辨。又該部對於破獲各案中意志薄弱，誤入歧途之靑年人犯，均以寬大爲懷，給予反省之機會，移送感化院，施以感化，期於自新後，仍可爲國效力。</p>
<h3>國府追贈樺島　三級同光勳章　明日在京開追悼會</h3>
<p>南京十二一日中央社電　全國經濟委員會顧問樺島千春，於日前逝世後，朝野上下，同深悼惜。我國府爲紀念樺島氏生前功績，特追贈三級同光勳章。茲誌國府令於後：國府令，三十三年五月十三日，全國經濟委員會顧問權島千春，追贈三級同光勳章，此令，主席汪兆銘</p>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　國民政府全國經濟委員會顧問樺島千春，不幸於五月十日午後七時，在京同仁會病院急病逝世。茲經中日關係各方面共同決定，於五月十五日午後五時至六時，在南京中山東路上乘庵西本願寺舉行追悼會。</p>
<h3>通往羅馬要道　大戰已開始　亞平寗德軍守新障地</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　海通社訊：美哥倫比亞廣播網駐義記者報告稱，反軸心軍在義國前綫發動大攻勢，雖人力物力均大爲優越，而開始不久，即在各點慘遭敗挫。德軍以噴火器作戰，本日黎明開始劇列反攻，反軸心主力則向卡錫里邦及阿比安兩處防綫推進，兩處均爲通往羅馬要道，距羅馬七十五英里。</p>
<p>又據德國社星期五日柏林訊，口星期四下午以來，義南部前綫加立里亞諾河下游與中游地區，劇烈戰爭即在進行中，此役目前雖爲局部性質，但英美軍計劃已久之新突破企圖，以此爲前奏，殆無疑義。此次新攻勢之準備，大約一週以前已告完成，自星期三下午以來，克拉克將軍之美第五軍向第勒尼安沿海地區，尤其海岸公路以及明土諾·卡斯德爾福德·與聖安勃羅琪奧等區之德軍前哨陣地，發動若干次偵察戰，均遭擊退。又敵方企圖在亞平　山西部向前推進，亦徒勞無功，亞平　山中部德軍已放棄其堅守四月之陣地，撤退至阿文提諾河上新陣地。英美方面聲稱，在該方面順利推進一節，殊與事實不符，因德軍撤退，敵方毫未覺察，該處並未發生戰事，敵軍迄今仍無渡過阿文提諾河之企圖。納吐諾登陸岸頭區，僅托爾迪區狄格利翁至阿普利亞公路上，敵數次進攻未成，在該登陸岸頭東南部，德衝鋒隊深入波爾哥巴特哥拉公路交义點西南之美軍堡壘，並殲滅該處敵軍。</p>
<p>戰事重要性</p>
<p>又據海通社訊，過四夜英美軍在義國南部戰錢西段，以精銳部隊開始進攻，此次戰役歴時短暫，故柏林軍事負責人土尚未評論其趨向，義南夏季大戰是否以此次進攻開始，此後二十四小時內即可分曉。反軸心軍在卡西諾方面進攻失敗後已歷數週，乃於前夜某圓月如畫，企圖打通進抵羅馬道路，先以砲火轟擊德軍陣地，然後由步隊開始進攻，但未獲逞。綜觀義境戰局，下列兩點仍未變動，而在未來戰役，更顯示其重要性，如　地理的情勢未變，英美軍必須仰攻德軍嚴密設防之山區陣地，僅在數點有通往北面之道路。　敵軍進攻，德方早已料及並洞悉敵方調查及改編情況。故敵方此次進攻，德軍毫不震驚，義南戰地情形特殊，英軍第八軍大部已自東翼調至西翼，數月來英軍均被阻於亞得里亞海岸方面桑格羅山谷前綫，無法解脫，而美軍第五軍則在卡西諾方面血戰。就目前之情勢而言，卡西諾附近里利山谷區（此點爲通羅馬險要）及豐泰澤福密亞海岸公路一帶，將爲新戰傷。</p>
<h3>美機白晝襲德　擊落九一架</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電德國新聞社訊：據德軍當局宜稱，美機十二日干襲德之中部及伯魯克斯，民衆頗受損害，空戰時德機及高射砲共擊落敵機九十一架。昨晚英機襲德北部沿岸地區及比利時，被擊落十三架。英美機不斷矗炸西部佔領區，可視爲侵歐作戰之進備，自五月一日至十日敵機共被擊落一八二架，其中一百廿架爲四引擎轟炸機。</p>
<h3>土停運銘礦事　德提出交涉</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電德政府關於士耳其對德禁止輸出　機事，十二日發表公報謂，土國此舉違反通商協定。德外交當局十三日正午接見記者團時，會謂巴本大使就該事件，與土耳其交涉，其所談內容，因外交之關係不能詳細發表。</p>
<h3>反軸心對小國　展開神經戰　脅誘兼施徒勞無功</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　反軸心方面自任命埃森霍華爲侵歐軍總司令以來，對第二戰綫之開闢，即相繼有種種傳說。本月十二日共同對洪牙利·羅馬尼亞·保加利亞·以及芬闌各國發出新神經戰式之勸告，要求各國即時脫離軸心國。該宜言同時由美國務院英外交部以及蘇富局共同發表，其內容要旨如次：　各國國民應即拋棄戰爭，停止對德軍之援助與協力，如是各國民自身之負担即可減輕。　各國國民如不能從速脫離德軍陣綫，繼續與德軍協力，其結果將更對各國國民不利，各國國民之前途，更不堪設想。反軸心方面雖極盡其懷柔與壓制手段，對軸心國展開神經攻勢。但擁護歐洲文明努力建設歐洲新秩序之軸心國家，絕不稍懈其堅決鬥志，預料反軸心方面嗣後類此之卑劣手段，更將不斷出現。</p>
<h3>南方戰區　要塞參觀記</h3>
<p>値此敵人總力反攻日趨熾烈之時，由其位置而言，且從其內部有無盡藏的資源看來，蘇門答臘是日本在南方作戰區域內之生命綫。最近記者視察該島最重要方面的某部份，茲錄見聞於次：</p>
<p>驅車穿進油田地帶</p>
<p>某月某日，午前十一時十分，由某地首途，驅車穿過兩傍種有橡膠樹，椰子樹及朱古力樹的叢林，而接連着的平坦這路。午後一時前，抵到第一行程的石油產地某處，即訪該地守備軍辦事室，聆某中尉的談話。</p>
<p>據說此地的石油質地非常優良，將土中噴出的原油，不費功夫加以精製，便可供給飛機使用。而且油田地帶與製油工廠以及將石油運至日本本國及其他近邊的佔領地之出口港，其位置均分散不聚集一處，所以由防掣立塲而觀，可稱適宜。自製油工廠至港埠，敷設若干條的鐵管，以此鐵管不斷地輸運着石油，例如其中的一處遭受敵機轟炸破壞時，其恢復舊態，極其容易，故更覺安然無處。</p>
<p>午後二時半由該地啟程赴某地，婉蜓曲折的道路，均用柏油鋪造，令人益感此處因是石油產地，故自往時交通機關，專着重於汽車。</p>
<p>現地材料製作抬床某月某日，這地方的響備隊以衛生兵爲中心，晌午前經門田中尉的斡旋，聚集下士官十四五人，開了座談會，到會的人都是離開本國若干年，其間自大陸且戰塲至馬來作戰，飽歷張塲，暢談壯烈戰績，連午飯的時間都忘記，一直談到將近四點方散。</p>
<p>這部隊自佈置於蘇門答臘防衛第一綫以來，均搜集現地的材料，由豐當的經騐，再加研究，製作了幾千架的抬床，分配於各部隊，以便敵軍反攻登陸時，可將傷病兵移送後方，爲萬全之策。會有澳洲俘處兵若干名，於該部隊監督之下，經過幾個月之後將遷移他處之時，特地爲俘虜們開了餞別的演劇會，表示這衛生隊一面有此溫暖的特性，而可鼓舞另外部隊的士氣。</p>
<p>值得稱讚的義勇軍</p>
<p>某月某日，從某地出發，的歷三小時抵達某地，即訪警備隊本部，得加藤大尉的饗導，晤該部部隊長。據說此地住民沒有一個不敬慕日軍的威武而來，一個中尉說：「我對部下時常說，諸君要愛撫原住民，荷蘭人過去只有加以侮蔑，並不愛護他們，所以住民總不能衷心服從。」這些話真是含着適切的意義。全長有若十公里。</p>
<p>構築陣地頗費心血</p>
<p>，據該部隊長所談　築陣地煞費苦心。例如張在海岸的鐵條網，在工作中間，夜間被海潮侵還，或半爲砂埋沒，時而被波浪流掉，迨至翌日才從頭做起，這樣有時候反覆了幾次。又造碉堡或各種砲座等的掩蓋，亦很不容易，用草葉虛飾的，都首先要從海上實騐檢點，同時亦要由空中加以檢點。然而一切的惡條件，均被日軍精神克服，現在固若金湯的鐵辟防壘，日軍正在海賓登陸，將予敵軍在海岸棄屍　纍。</p>
<p>原住民的衷心協力</p>
<p>某月某日，我們的汽車，捲起濛濛的砂塵疾駛。右方是數十丈的斷崖，忽然俯瞰岸下，有茫茫的巨浪怒吼着，左方則有山　重疊，是千古的密林。汽車的前面有野猿或六尺長的大蜥蜴愴惶地橫過道路穿人草業中去。不一會至平坦的地帶，有簡陋的人家點綴其間。記者經過的道路到處有原住民們，數人成一羣在修理破損的道路或橋　，他們看了汽車便呌「日本」。學着軍隊的禮式舉手致敬。他們臉上浮顯笑容，他們的內心是在眞誠協力着日本（弘譯自四月十入日讀賈報知）</p>

<h3>中小學敎職員捕助費　敎局擬定徵收須知</h3>
<p>本市公私立中小學校敎職員，待遇菲薄，不堪生活會於本月五日由陳市長丁部長茶會招待各界商討各種補助原則十四點，茲悉教育局爲促進該項辦法於本月起實現，並避免流弊起見，特縝密規定市立中小學校徵收敎職員生活補助贊須知，及私立中小學校徽收敎職員生活補助　須知各一種，呈府備案，並通令各校遵照辦理，茲將該兩項須知分誌如下：</p>
<p>上海特別市私立中小學校徵收敎職員生活補助費須知</p>
<p>私立各中小學校，應遵照上海特別市公私立中小學校敎職員生活補助費捐納辦法，辦理徽收各該校敎職員生活補助費事宜。　私立中小學校（以下簡稱各校）向學生家畏征收敎職員生活補助費（以下簡稱補助費）前，應就近向地方人士暨各該校學生家長妥爲聯絡，商定各家長每月認助金額，由學生家長填具補助敎職員生活費認定書存校，（格式另附）并於五月二十五日前，將家長認助生活費之淸單，（格式另附）報局備查。　本年五六七三個月份補助費，各校盡於本年五月底一次收齊爲原則，所用收據爲　利各校收費敏捷及節省手續起見，暫准各校依照局頒三聯收據樣張，自行繕印，加蓋學校鈐記，呈局騐印後方准便用，（如有未經敎育局騐印之學校生活補助費收據發現時，當受處分）惟於捐款收霽後，各該學校仍應將收據存根，連同淸冊，呈報本局備查。（註）收據騐印手續，一，三聯收據騎絲號數，以各該校爲單位，並須以校各爲某字第一號至第零號，由各校自行編定，每本以五十頁爲限·二，各校生活補助費三通收據，送量騐印手續，由各該校備文連同空白收據，註明　〇本逕送本局秘書室騐印，並發給臨時收條，即日取次日憑條來局領回騐　收據。三，各校送到收據時，由監印負實人員點收，隨時登記，具領時由具領人簽名蓋章。　各校每日所收生活補助費，應即日以各該校敎員生活補助費戶名，經各該校經費積核委員會之同意，存入　興銀行或其他銀行，但未經各該校校務會義議決分配方案前，不准動用。　各秘所征補助費，應以每月總額百分之九十平均補助敎職員之生活費，百分之十補助學校辦公費等。　各校所征補助費存入銀行後，應即按照上條標準，自行召集校務會議，議定分配方案，並將分配敎職員工個別情形作成報吿書，呈報本局備查。　各校對於補助費分配標準，如囚特殊情形有所建議變通時，須提出學校收支報告書，附具充分理由，經各該校校務會議或校董會義決議後，呈候本局核奪施行。　各校征收分配補助費，應由各該校經費稽核委員會負實審核收支賬目，（本局於本年一月十日會以敎三字第四號訓令通飭公　立中小學校，應自本學期起參照部頒中小學規程之規定，一律由校長轉知專任敎員公推三人至五人，組織經費稽核委員會輪流充當主席，負責審核學校收支賬目，每月開會一次，）並將委員名單於本年五月底前報局備查。　各校征收補助費如有具報不實，或　自變更分配標準，少發補助員工生活費等情。得由助款人或敎職員向局呈控，經局查明屬實，予以懲處。以上四項分別移動金額，由局隨時酌量核定施行。　各校向本局具領生活補助費後，應於三日內分發全校員工，全校員工分配補助費標準，以按照員工人數平均分配為原則，但校工每人應按照半個職敎員人數計算，各校校長應按二個職敎員人數計算，（包括征費辦公用費）小學主任及高年級級任敎員應按一點二人計算，小學日語敎師其他職敎員均按一人計算，兼課日語敎員不得兼領，兼課補助費中學兼課敎員，應按照其授課時數與專任敎員授課時數之比率計算，（如初中專任教員每週應授十八小時，某兼任敎員僅每週授課六小時，則照三分之一人計算，但不得少於四分之一人計算），專任敎員及日籍日語敎員或職員，均照一人計算。　各校於具領補助費分配後，應將分配情形作成分配報告書，報局備查。　　各校征收分配補助費，應由校長將收支眼目，提向校務會議報告，如有具報不實，或擅自變更分配辦法者，得由助款人或敎職員向局呈控，經局查明屬實，予以懲處。　　中立中小學校以外，社會方而認助教職員生活補助費，由本局訂期倂案辦理分配。</p>
<p>上海特別市市立中小學校征收敎職員生活補助費須知</p>
<p>市立各中小學應遵照上海特別市公私立中小學敎員生活補助費捐納辦法，辦理征收生活補助費事宜·　市立中小學校（以下簡稱各校）向學生家長征收敎職員生活補助費（以下簡稱補助費）前，照就近向地方人士暨各該校學生家長妥爲聯絡，商定各家長每月認助全額，由學生家長填具補助敎職員生活費認定盡存校，（格式另附）並於五月二十五日前先將家長認助生活費之淸單，（格式另附）報局備核，　本年五六七三個月份補助費各校，儘於本年五月底一次收齊爲原則，收款後隨將局頒三聯收據，以一聯交給助款家長，（或非學生家長之捐納人）一聯存校，一聯存根（存根於款項收齊後連同淸冊一併呈局備查），　各校所征補助費，應於本年五月底前以各該校敎職員生活補助費戶名（市立學校敎職員生活補助費）存人復興銀行（河南路三馬路口）或以下該行任何一辦事處。一，復興銀行南區辦事處（泰山路馬當路口即前霞飛路馬浪路口），二，復興銀行北區辦事處（閘北中央市塲內，）三，復興銀行西區辦事處，（靜安寺愚圍路口）惟提款時，應憑市敎育局指定之印　支付之。　各校征收存放本學期補助學定於本年五月底前辦畢，如有特殊情形，非延期一部份征收時，除應於五月底前先將巳收部份存放一次外，餘款限於六月十五日前辦畢全部征收暨解送銀行手續。　各校於解款到銀行後，塵將銀行解款報告書，（另附格式）即日交郵掛號逕寄本局取派人專送亦可，以便準備核辦分配事宜。　各校所收補助費，如能於五月底全數收齊解交銀行，則於六月份一次將所收三個月補助費，核發各校具領，否則應分六七月兩次核發各校具領。　各校所收補助費總額，除扣除收據印刷費總額外，以各該校所收補助費之九成，充各該校員工生活費，以一成酌量充作下列各費：甲，移助收入最少學校員工之生活補助費，乙，移助市立未收補助費社敎機關員工之生活補助費，丁，移助收費成績特優學校之獎勵金。</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>戰時浪費可恥</h3>
<p>我們屢次指出，在此戰時，應絕對實錢節約生活。就宴會而言·目的或爲聚議事務，或爲聯絡情感，原則上同然有其必要，而不可厚非。可是宴會的方式，必須適應戰時節約的意義。因爲戰時浪費最是可恥。所以，我們塲力主張凡有宴會，以茶點爲主，一杯淸茶，一碟粗點，同樣可以表示意思，同樣可以達到聚議與聯絡的目的。高資的咖啡，豐處的三明治，大可不必浪費。</p>
<p>其次，如有餐叙的必要，則以便飯爲主，數碟家常便榮，也同樣可以表示意思而達到叙談目的。至於杯盤狼藉，滿桌盛　，也大可不必。午間用酒，更是有干禁例。</p>
<p>再看虹口方面日本高等酒館的廢止，更是表示實踐節約的決心。希望中國人士做主人或做賓客的，都須自　注意節約。同時，我們感覺公務人員（當然指高級官吏而言）尤有節約宴會的必耍，做主人固然要節約，做賓客也應節約，辭謝　盛的筵宴。更須顧到公務時間的齊貴，因爲宴叙如麻，足以費時而誤事。</p>
<p>最後，請客柬帖，也應節約。用一張白報紙記明時間即可，紙張講究，印刷精美，都是浪費的。</p>

<h3>大房東加租　三房客攤派問題</h3>

<p>隆夫的服務地點，是銀座街的巴里堂化裝品店宣傳部。化裝品瓶的花紋和廣告圖案，都按主任得家的命令涂色，這就是他的工作。工作本身雖無任荷典味，然而同事却都是擺藝術家架子神氣活現的傢伙們·隆夫現在反比在市來家中時，更能詳細地知道了貴家的氣質，和畫家的派頭。同時，在巴里堂零售部的畫廊裹，常常舉行西洋畫的個人展覽會，所以便和許多畫家面熱了。請吃燒鷄的鶴原敬一，也是其中的一個。</p>
<p>隆夫雖知道了各種新的畫風和技巧，然而他的實也並沒受到任何影響。在高圓寺的公寓裹，星期天和夜裹，總是拼命繼續不斷的用功，但始終仍不過是賽老式的　畫。該獎他的是市來畫家，但陸夫本身，却　得滿足了。</p>

<h3>Indifference</h3>
<p>— Tōsuke Yoshida</p>
<p>Someone once asked me: "If the situation in East Asia continues as it is, the Chinese will never actively participate in the war. The Anglo-American style of hedonism is still rampant in Shanghai. Why are the Chinese intellectuals witnessing this national demise without resolutely rising up?" Not only this Japanese person, but also many Chinese people, are thoroughly criticizing Chinese intellectuals for their passive attitude towards the current political situation. Among the Japanese, there is a prevailing discussion: that the current Chinese politics are bad, and it is the responsibility of Chinese intellectuals to correct this, but Chinese intellectuals are just standing by and watching the suffering of the general public, and hoping for the improvement of the current political situation is like "waiting for the Yellow River to run clear." I would also scold such an attitude of Chinese intellectuals as "sitting on the fence," but to be honest, the responsibility for Chinese intellectuals holding this "sitting on the fence" attitude cannot but be attributed to the attitude of the Japanese as well. But the reason why I have not asked the Japanese side to conduct self-criticism, I think anyone who thinks about it a little will understand immediately. Confucius also said: "If one does not say, 'What shall I do? What shall I do?' I can indeed do nothing with him." (Wei Linggong) If the other party only says what they want to say, and has no intention of discussing "What shall I do? What shall I do?" even Confucius has no way to deal with such a person. In other words, before implementing a "policy change," there is a tendency among the Japanese to only say what they want to say. Many Japanese people do not want to listen to the opinions of Chinese people on the Chinese issue, but only push out the Japanese Greater East Asia ideology, and fabricate the idea that Chinese people "must do this and that." Any Chinese people who do not conform to this idea are deeply resented and severely suppressed. Therefore, at that time, Chinese intellectuals did not want to have a head-on theoretical conflict with the Japanese on Chinese issues and East Asian issues, but thought that it was better to avoid provoking the Japanese and to get away from them as soon as possible. However, Chinese intellectuals do not harbor irreconcilable national hatred towards the Japanese, nor do they have a permanent attitude of shared hatred. Because they all know that without the Japanese Meiji Restoration, the entire Asia would have become a colony of Britain and the United States long ago. At the same time, they also understand that if Japan were to be destroyed, China alone would absolutely not be able to maintain its independence and freedom against the attacks of Anglo-American financial capital. Only on this point are they sincerely willing to assist Japan. Since assistance is needed, the Japanese should listen fully to the opinions of Chinese intellectuals with a friendly attitude. If the Japanese are willing to listen to such national demands of China with a friendly attitude, I believe that Chinese intellectuals will always be sincerely willing to talk to the Japanese openly and honestly. Conversely, if the Japanese are always like a fierce wild bull, just rushing around according to their own goals, and always respond to what Chinese intellectuals say with indifference, then they can only politely step aside. Because if they engage in theoretical struggles with the Japanese head-on, it will only result in being hit over the head and will not help the situation, so the best way to deal with the Japanese is to respect them and keep a distance.</p>
<p>I also know this Chinese mentality very well. I often ask people in high positions of power for their opinions on Chinese issues. I certainly don't have the authority to deal with this issue, but I know that the Chinese issue is a major issue that affects the fate of the motherland, so I study it with enthusiasm. For this reason, no matter how high or powerful the person is, I will not hesitate to give advice and persuade them. However, if the other party's understanding of the Chinese is too superficial, and they stubbornly cling to their own superficial views and do not listen to me, I can only consider myself unlucky. At the same time, I think that the best way to deal with such Japanese people is to avoid offending them as much as possible, implement a policy of respecting the gods and keeping them at a distance, and only put on a forced smile and mechanically repeat what the other party says. I believe that this attitude and spirit is the Chinese intellectuals' attitude and spirit of individualism or self-preservation in dealing with the Japanese. Chinese intellectuals have the most brilliant performance in this attitude and spirit, which is very different from clumsy people like us. Zeng Guofan believed that if one encounters a foreigner who insults one in person, the best method is to smile gently and pretend to be a fool who does not understand their words. Chinese people who have received this kind of education believe that when the other party cannot be reasoned with, they use the "perfunctory" method to deal with everything. This has the same meaning as "dealing with" in Japanese. However, educated Chinese people never show this kind of "perfunctoriness" on the surface, but express it in a very polite and respectful way, so that the other party who is being "dealt with" does not realize that they are being "dealt with." Gu Hongming used the term "polite evasiveness" to describe this technique of the Chinese. When Chinese and Japanese celebrities gather for a meal, I often humbly occupy the last seat as an interpreter, but what amazes and admires me is that all the Chinese celebrities are genius experts in using "polite evasiveness"—it would be more appropriate to use the term cunning old foxes here.</p>
<p>Only the blind cannot see the Chinese's polite evasiveness in the Chinese intellectuals' passive attitude towards the current political situation. If Chinese intellectuals are experts in "perfunctoriness," then Japan can only deal with this with "sincerity." Because sincerity does not allow any deception. As for why the Chinese avoid the Japanese, it is because they believe that the Japanese are unreasonable. Therefore, before the Japanese say what they want to say, they must first let the Chinese say what they want to say. At this time, even if what the Chinese say is fundamentally different from the Japanese opinions, even if there are things that make people's hair stand on end, do not immediately raise your hand and give them a punch, but use theoretical struggle to persuade the other party, or be persuaded by the other party. In short, it is necessary to seek a common "reason" between the two major ethnic groups in theory. If the Japanese can prove to the Chinese that they understand reason, then Chinese intellectuals will not quietly avoid the Japanese like avoiding a bull, and will definitely take a step further and begin to engage in head-on theoretical struggles with the Japanese. This is the best way to eliminate the political passivity of Chinese intellectuals and make them participate in East Asian politics. (Translated by Lu)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Attack Assam: Bloody Battles Around Kohima; Enemy Supplies Increasingly Difficult Due to Approaching Rainy Season</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 13th – The offensive and defensive battles in the Kohima area are becoming increasingly fierce due to the approaching rainy season. The enemy is actively counterattacking in order to prevent the Japanese troops from attacking Dimapur and to recapture Kohima, in order to open up the supply route to Imphal. The Japanese troops are both engaging in counterattacks and actively advancing into Assam. As a result, bloody battles have erupted around Kohima. Currently, the enemy troops are trapped in a Japanese encirclement. At the same time, the 40,000 British troops whose retreat routes and ground supply lines have been cut off were originally only supplied with materials by air. Now, due to the arrival of the rainy season, aerial resupply is hindered, making it even more difficult. Therefore, the enemy's only hope is to open up the highway from Imphal to Dimapur. The enemy has no other way to rescue the Fourth Army except to recapture Kohima. Therefore, since May, the enemy has been actively counterattacking, not only continuing to dispatch troops from Chittagong and Shillong (west of Kohima) to reinforce Dimapur, but also gradually transferring troops from the north to the south to watch Kohima. The enemy troops in the area north of Dimapur to Kohima include the Fifth Division and the Forty-Fourth Division of the Fifteenth Army, which were previously in the Chittagong area, as well as the Forty-Second Independent Tank Corps with mechanized units. These forces are repeatedly counterattacking with the highway from Kohima to Dimapur as the center. In addition, the enemy artillery north of Zubza (10 kilometers northwest of Kohima and between Jotsoma) is fiercely shelling the Japanese positions day and night to support the defense of a corner of the 4600 high ground. At the same time, they are also using elite infantry units and well-trained air force units to attack the Japanese positions south of the 460 high ground west of Kohima and the 5129 high ground east of it. In addition, the enemy troops advancing southward from the Mokokchung Bridge (90 kilometers north-northwest of Kohima) are moving around in the area north of Narma, and part of them have infiltrated the dense forest area between Longkhum and Tsomi, attempting to disrupt the Japanese rear. However, the Japanese units not only inflicted heavy damage on the enemy troops, but also strengthened their offensive against Dimapur.</p>
<h3>Corner of Enemy Linear Defense Line Broken Through</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – According to reports from the Indian front, the enemy troops around Palel have now received reinforcements of about 1,000 troops from the Wakching (15 kilometers north of Palel) area and are continuing their efforts to resist. On the morning of the 8th, well-trained Japanese troops dispatched aircraft to attack a corner of the linear defense line of Senaamk-Taglaam-Kankuno south of the highway, which the enemy was desperately defending. They broke through several barbed wire fences, opened a breakthrough route, and then launched a fierce attack on the 4562 high ground, completely occupying it. Another Japanese unit fiercely attacked the Sabam (9 kilometers southeast of Palel) fortress north of the highway and brought it under control. As a result, a corner of the linear defense line where the enemy was attempting to make a last stand was broken through by the Japanese troops, threatening the central part of the line. In addition, the enemy troops at the Palel and Imphal airfields east of the highway and at the Kyakhaung airfield are relying on strong fortifications to resist. Japanese aircraft have been continuously bombing them since the 9th, and ground attacks have also inflicted heavy damage. Enemy trucks are fully loaded with wounded soldiers and are being transported towards Imphal. The fierce fighting in the final stages of the battle of Palel is evident from this. The Japanese troops have recently received reinforcements and are now fiercely attacking the defeated enemy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Appoint Envoy to Promote Pan-Asianism: Mr. Godo Arrives in Manchuria</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Xinjing, 13th – Mr. Takuo Godo, the Japanese envoy dispatched to Manchuria to promote Pan-Asianism, arrived in Xinjing by plane at 4:00 PM on the 12th. He is scheduled to stay in Manchuria for more than ten days. In addition to personally visiting various agencies in Xinjing to hold cordial talks and gatherings, he also plans to travel to Harbin, Anshan, and other places, or hold lectures, and investigate the actual situation in various places. He is scheduled to leave Xinjing and return to Japan on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Situation Consolidated in Central Pacific: Enemy Aircraft Attack Rabaul and Truk</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – Although the war situation in the Pacific has remained tense in the past one or two weeks, there has been no significant movement. This indicates that while the enemy wants to advance quickly, their actions are gradually being limited. The Japanese side is turning all resources in the occupied territories in the south into combat power and actively producing war materials. On the contrary, US military production has now reached its peak, which is actually a major obstacle to the enemy's counterattack attempt. Japan's strength is still steadily increasing, which is the opposite of what they imagine. For example, the fact that the Japanese army launched the Imphal operation this time and was able to launch large-scale operations at the same time is proof of the strong strength of Japan. The Japanese army's position in the Central Pacific is now becoming more and more consolidated. The elite Japanese army and navy are determined to crush the enemy's movements at any time and anywhere. In short, there is no major shift in the war situation in the Pacific. There are only guerrilla-like movements by the enemy. Currently, the enemy mobile units are gathering in the Marshall Islands, and on the northern coast of New Guinea, they are still trying to advance at any opportunity. The situation of the movements in that area is recorded as follows: In the Solomon Islands, Rabaul is still the center of enemy air attacks. The number of incoming aircraft in the past was 900 per day, but now it has been reduced to 100. Each time they attack, many are shot down or destroyed by the Japanese garrison. From May 6 to date, a total of 30 enemy aircraft have been shot down. In addition, the Japanese army sank an enemy torpedo boat and destroyed an enemy destroyer in the Santa Isabel area on the 6th. In the New Guinea area, enemy aircraft occasionally attack in numbers of 20. In the past week, the Japanese army shot down and destroyed 6 enemy aircraft in that area. In the Banda Sea area, Ambon, Ternate, and other places are also occasionally attacked by several to a dozen enemy aircraft. From May 4 to 8, the Japanese army shot down and destroyed 6 enemy aircraft. In the Central Pacific area, enemy aircraft are only conducting small-scale guerrilla actions against Ponape, Truk, Mili, Mortlock, and Guam.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rabaul, 13th – On the 10th and 11th, 100 enemy aircraft attacked Rabaul each day. The Japanese army in that area immediately engaged in counterattacks. It is estimated that 5 enemy aircraft were shot down and 4 destroyed on the 10th, and 2 were shot down on the 11th. There were no losses on the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – According to reports from a certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific, approximately 26 enemy aircraft attacked Truk Island on the morning of the 10th. Three were shot down by the Japanese army and two were destroyed. The Japanese side suffered minor losses.</p>
<h3>Joint British-American Air Fleet Heavily Damaged in Attack on Burma</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 13th – On the afternoon of the 12th, the Japanese fighter squadron received an alert that enemy aircraft were attacking and immediately dispatched to a certain area. They encountered 12 enemy P-38 and 12 P-51 aircraft and engaged in a fierce air battle, shooting down 7 enemy P-51 aircraft (including 4 unconfirmed) and repelling them. In addition, the enemy aircraft that attacked the area on the 11th were a joint British-American fighter squadron. The upper formation was composed of Hurricane aircraft, the middle formation was composed of North American aircraft, and the lowest formation was composed of Lockheed P-38 aircraft. They attacked in three-tier formations. This was the first joint operation by the British and American armies and is of great importance. Five of the eight British Hurricane aircraft in the top tier were shot down, suffering heavy damage.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Tojo to Explain "Beliefs Regarding the Current Situation": All-Japan Uprising Rally to be Held This Morning</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – The Central Headquarters of the All-Japan National Uprising Movement will be held solemnly at the Hibiya Public Hall here at 8:00 AM on the 14th, under the auspices of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Imperial Rule Political Association. At that time, Prime Minister Tojo will frankly explain "Beliefs Regarding the Current Situation," emphasizing that in order to defeat the stubborn enemies Britain and the United States, the people of the country should recognize the current situation and make efforts in all aspects of production. Those attending the meeting include officials from the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, the Imperial Rule Political Association, and other government officials, as well as representatives from various important industries, a total of more than 5,000 people from 50-odd cooperating organizations. After the meeting, representatives will be selected to go to the Ise Grand Shrine and the Meiji Shrine to offer prayers for victory.</p>
<h3>Appropriate Time for Reflection by Chongqing: Recluse of Jiangnan</h3>
<p>The troops of Tang Enbo in Chongqing were known as the Iron Army, brave and good at fighting, but in the Henan front, they were effortlessly defeated by the Japanese army in less than twenty days. The Japanese army drove straight in and occupied 60,000 square miles of land. This achievement shocked the world.</p>
<p>The anti-Axis side has now recognized that the Japanese army still has strong potential on all fronts. On the one hand, it is criticizing the leaders of Chongqing, believing that Chongqing is no longer trustworthy. It should be known that the failure of the Chongqing army on the Henan front was actually deceived by Britain and the United States, and Chongqing should reflect on this. Chongqing knows that the reason for the weakness of its military strength is due to the US military's stingy assistance. In the Henan campaign, Tang Enbo's army suffered heavy losses because of the lack of military equipment. This blow prompted Chongqing to re-examine the question of whether the so-called assistance from the United States was "sincere." In fact, they have long expressed dissatisfaction with the United States, and some even advocate reconsidering their attitude towards that country. The Ta Kung Pao said in its May 10 editorial that since October of last year, the United States, according to the Lend-Lease Act, provided 40 percent to Britain, 21 percent to the Soviet Union, and China received only 2 percent. The decisive moment of the Pacific War is approaching, and Chongqing is an important country in East Asia, and should receive greater military aid from the United States, etc. The above remarks are enough to represent Chongqing's dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Chongqing Lacks Military Equipment</p>
<p>At a reception for foreign reporters held by Zhang Pingqun, spokesman for the Executive Yuan of Chongqing, on the 10th of this month, someone asked, "Will the victory of the Japanese army in Henan prompt Chongqing to ask the United States to train its troops?" Zhang replied that training cannot be victorious if military equipment is lacking. Now that the Chongqing army has no heavy weapons such as tanks and is in an unfavorable environment, it has suffered heavy losses. We sincerely hope that the Allied countries will provide assistance quickly to avoid further defeats. However, the government and the people are convinced that the supply of weapons depends on the smooth flow of transportation, and the blockage of transportation is currently the most serious problem." In fact, there is currently no transportation route that can directly reach Chongqing. No matter how loudly the leaders of Chongqing cry out for help, they cannot obtain sufficient military equipment, and their anxious state of mind is self-evident. Furthermore, the US Lend-Lease Act stipulates that repayment must be made with materials, which shows that the United States wants to treat China as a colony after the war. Not only that, Chongqing has two infantry training schools supervised by US military officers, and four more are planned to be established. The Sino-British mixed aviation team has also been established. The equipment of the Chongqing army has also been Americanized. The Chongqing army currently does not need this kind of training, but it is being subjected to Americanized training. What is its political intention? There is no doubt that the United States wants to seize power in China after the war. Zhang Chuanshi's mention of this point was indeed filled with poignant irony.</p>
<p>The leaders of the Chongqing regime should know what steps the United States is taking in order to achieve its ultimate goals in China. If the leaders of Chongqing have not yet realized the intentions of the United States, then with the battles on the Henan front raging, now is the most appropriate time to reconsider the true intentions and motives of the United States.</p>

<h3>Various Towns and Villages in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces to Levy Two Consumption Taxes: Tax Bureau Submits Proposal to Ministry of Finance for Implementation Next Week</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th – The Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau, under orders, has been collecting special consumption taxes on retail goods and banquets in restaurants in 15 cities and counties, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wujin, Danyang, Changshu, Wuhu, Bengbu, Yangzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Shaoxing, and Ningbo, since January 16 of this year, by the tax branches affiliated to the local bureaus. After several months, the results have been very good. It has recently been learned that in order to increase tax revenue and equalize the national tax burden, the bureau has submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Finance to universally levy the above-mentioned two special consumption taxes on towns, villages, and ports in the cities and counties of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, other than those where special consumption taxes have already been levied, starting on the 16th of this month. As for the special consumption taxes levied by the financial departments of various provinces in the past, they will all be transferred to the local general affairs agencies affiliated to the bureau for collection starting on the 16th. For other areas where tax agencies have not been established, the bureau will entrust the provincial, city, and county governments to collect taxes on its behalf.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Southeast of Dengfeng Shrink Encirclement: Tang's Troops Trapped and Lose Combat Power</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 13th – The Japanese troops southeast of Dengfeng have encircled Tang Enbo's army and have recently been pressing them further. Tang Enbo's army is the elite of the Chongqing army, but since the Japanese army began the Yellow River crossing operation and the encirclement operation in the Funiu Mountains, only a little over two weeks have passed. 170,000 people have lost their combat power.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th – The elite units of the North China Japanese Army crossed the Old Yellow River and the New Yellow River on a large scale on the 18th of last month, and swept across the Henan Plain. Chiang's direct line troops under Tang Enbo's command, who were stubbornly defeated, are now trapped in the Funiu Mountains. Another unit of the Japanese army chased fiercely to Xuchang. The fleeing defeated troops moved south along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, causing the strong enemy in Yancheng to collapse. The elite units of the Central China Japanese Army moved north from Wuhan, dispersed the Fifth War Zone Army under Li Zongren's command, and made rapid advances. The invincible Japanese army, the northern and southern armies, met on the 9th of this month at Queshan on the Beijing-Hankou Railway. Here, the transportation hub from Wuhan to North China has been completed, and the transportation of troops and offensive operations can be carried out freely, and the threat to the enemy is constantly increasing.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Hata Arrives at the Front</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th – The Japanese Resident Army Headquarters in China announced at 2:00 PM on the 13th that Commander-in-Chief Hata had arrived at the Henan front in North China on May 8 to guide the operation in the Henan area.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Hankou, 13th – The Japanese Central China Army, in response to the offensive of the North China Army, suddenly launched a full-scale offensive against the Fifth War Zone of Chongqing on May 1. The Chongqing army under Li Zongren's command retreated without any resistance. Since the Japanese army began its operation, it has occupied two places in just a few days, and the Japanese army is still advancing fiercely towards a certain important point, and a part of it has already joined forces with the North China Army in Queshan.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Shoot Down Attacking Enemy Aircraft</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tai'an, 13th – The Japanese Air Force units intercepted a joint squadron of US Air Force fighters and bombers stationed in Chongqing, consisting of 11 P-40 aircraft and 5 B-25 aircraft, attacking east of Luoyang at 2:30 PM on the 11th. At the same time, Japanese aircraft intercepted them over Quyang and Mianchi. After a fierce air battle, one of the P-40 aircraft was shot down, but this has not been confirmed. The Japanese side suffered no losses in this battle and safely returned to their positions.</p>
<h3>Military Political Department Repeatedly Cracks Down; Chongqing Communists' Reactionary Conspiracies; Many Cases Cracked in Half a Year</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, since its establishment, has been in operation for half a year. Staff in various locations, under the leadership of Director Huang Ziqiang, Deputy Director Yang Zhen, and Bureau Chiefs Wan Lilang and Hu Junhe, have all been diligent and dedicated, burying themselves in hard work, and vigorously advancing their fixed work. They have repeatedly cracked down on the conspiracies and assassination cases of reactionary elements from Chongqing and the Red Communists. The problems are nipped in the bud and public safety is relied upon. Apart from a portion of the above-mentioned cases that still require investigation and are not yet suitable for publication, the names, locations, firearms, and ammunition of the perpetrators in the cases cracked by the department in the past half-year are disclosed below:</p>
<p>Zhou Polang, the Director of the Self-Defense Association Reorganization Committee of Zhuji County, Chongqing, collected 150 enemy soldiers from the former Zhuji County Self-Defense Force and reorganized them into a special task force. Equipped with two light machine guns and over thirty rifles, he dispatched Chen Yueliang as the captain, and they roamed around various townships in Zhuji County, including Changji, Changhe, Pule, and Dongping, specializing in harassing the local area and plotting against our peace workers and transportation personnel. Recently, it was reported that internal factions caused rifts. Members of the former Self-Defense Force and Zhou Polang's direct personnel discriminated against each other due to unequal treatment, creating an irreconcilable situation. At the end of February, the enemy clashed in a certain location, resulting in Zhou Youliang, the squad leader of Zhou's direct line, being killed by Chen Yueliang. The soldiers under his command harbored different intentions and deserted with their weapons. The remaining twenty or so people were all former members of the "Self-Defense Force." The situation had reached a point where retreat was difficult. Chen had no choice but to lead the force to sneak to a certain location, hesitant about their next move. Seeing that the opportunity was ripe, our side dispatched twenty-five working comrades, equipped with weapons, at dawn on March 11th, rushing to the destination in the rain. They arrived at approximately 8:00 AM and carried out a lightning-style encirclement. At that time, the enemy was still asleep, caught off guard by the unexpected turn of events. From the captain, Chen Yueliang, down to twenty-three individuals, all personnel and equipment were captured by us without anyone escaping. The names of the captured Chongqing special task force members and the confiscated firearms and ammunition are listed below: (1) Captured Personnel: Chen Yueliang (Captain), Zhao Tieshan, Hong Huaishui (Squad Leaders), He Sen (Adjutant), Zhang Yitian (Intelligence Team Leader), Cai Zhi, He Chunshui, Shou Zhong, He Xiong, Xuan Tiejun (above are Platoon Leaders), Yu Fushan, Zhu Dingcai (Light Machine Gunners), Wu Sen, Zhao Ziyou, Wang Licai, Zhang Yong, Zhang Zaiyang (above are Private Soldiers), Zhou Quanpin, Guo Liang (Private First Class), Yang Rengui, Guo Hongshan (Ten Household Heads), Zhen Xian, Chen Xingliang (Messengers).

<p>Shen Yihang, leader of the demolition group of the Chongqing Loyalty and National Salvation Army's Cheng-Xi-Yu Office's training battalion, along with group members Zhang Mingsheng and three others, carried one five-pound thermos and one milk bottle each, filled with explosive materials, and infiltrated Wuxi city on December 3rd of last year, attempting to sabotage the city before the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. They were arrested on December 7th, and two blocks of explosives were seized.</p>
<p>Liu Guanghua, the investigation organization chief of the Chongqing Jiangpu County government, under the orders of County Magistrate Yao Jinghan, infiltrated the capital city to transport weapons to the north of the Yangtze River. Personnel were dispatched to arrest the suspect and apprehend accomplices Liu Jinbao and Wan Zukang.</p>
<p>Wan Ziliang, a Chongqing guerrilla member, under the command of Yang Taigui, the battalion commander of the 2nd detachment of the 10th column of the guerrilla force, infiltrated the capital city to purchase handguns. Personnel were dispatched to arrest the suspect and apprehend accomplices Tian Chou, Tang Zhusan, Zhang Dachun, Li Ruiren, Liu Yongnian, and five others.</p>
<p>Smugglers of military supplies Shi Jiasheng, Zhang Renju, and others were smuggling explosives across the river to aid the enemy in the outskirts of Qixia Mountain. Personnel were dispatched to arrest the two suspects on the evening of December 15th and confiscate one hundred sticks of explosives. They claimed that "the explosives were purchased from a person named Shi Jia, a ship boss, at ten yuan per stick and resold to the Red bandits for profit. Shi Jiaye was ill, so they were transporting them on his behalf." The suspects were transferred to the Capital City Local Court for trial. Furthermore, the department, with leniency, treated young offenders in all cracked cases who were weak-willed and had strayed from the right path, giving them an opportunity to repent, transferring them to reformatories, reforming them, and expecting them to serve the country after their rehabilitation.</p>
<h3>National Government posthumously awards Habashima the Third Class Tongguang Medal; Memorial Service to be Held in Nanjing Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Major Battle Begins on the Road to Rome; German Troops Defend New Positions in the Apennines</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Reuters reports: A correspondent for the American Columbia Broadcasting System in Italy reported that the anti-Axis forces had launched a major offensive on the Italian front. Although they had superior manpower and resources, they were defeated at all points shortly after the start. The German army used flamethrowers to fight and launched a fierce counterattack starting at dawn today. The main force of the anti-Axis forces advanced towards the defense lines of Cassino and Albano, both of which were on the road to Rome, 75 miles from Rome.</p>
<p>According to a Friday report from the German News Agency in Berlin, since Thursday afternoon, fierce battles have been taking place in the lower and middle reaches of the Garigliano River on the southern Italian front. Although this battle is currently local in nature, there is no doubt that it is a prelude to a long-planned breakthrough attempt by the British and American armies. Preparations for this new offensive were completed about a week ago. Since Wednesday afternoon, General Clark's US Fifth Army has launched several reconnaissance battles against the German outposts in the Tyrrhenian coastal area, especially the coastal highway and the areas of Minturno, Castelforte, and Sant'Ambrogio, all of which were repelled. Furthermore, the enemy's attempt to advance in the western Apennines was also futile. The German army in the central Apennines has abandoned its positions held for four months and retreated to new positions on the Aventino River. Claims by the British and Americans of a successful advance in this area are inconsistent with the facts, as the enemy was unaware of the German retreat and no fighting took place there. The enemy has made no attempt to cross the Aventino River to date. In the Nettuno landing head area, the enemy's repeated attacks on the Tolentino-Ardea-Aprilia road were unsuccessful. In the southeastern part of the landing head, German stormtroopers penetrated the American fortifications southwest of the intersection of the Borgo Sabotino road and annihilated the enemy troops there.</p>
<p>Importance of the Battle</p>
<p>Reuters also reports that the British and American armies began their offensive with elite troops on the western section of the southern Italian front on Thursday night. Because the battle has been short and swift, Berlin military officials have yet to comment on its direction. Whether the summer offensive in southern Italy has begun with this attack will be clear within the next twenty-four hours. After the anti-Axis forces failed to attack in the Cassino area for several weeks, they attempted to open the road to Rome on a clear moonlit night by bombarding the German positions with artillery fire, followed by an infantry attack, but were unsuccessful. Looking at the overall situation of the Italian campaign, the following two points remain unchanged and will be more important in future battles: 1. The geographical situation has not changed. The British and American armies must attack uphill against the well-fortified mountainous positions of the German army, with only a few roads leading to the north. 2. The German army had anticipated the enemy's attack and understood the enemy's reconnaissance and reorganization. Therefore, the German army was not shocked by the enemy's attack. The situation on the southern Italian front is special. Most of the British Eighth Army has been transferred from the eastern wing to the western wing. For months, the British army has been blocked on the Sangro Valley front on the Adriatic coast, unable to break through, while the US Fifth Army has fought bloody battles in the Cassino area. As of the current situation, the Liri Valley area near Cassino (a vital point on the road to Rome) and the coastal road of Formia will be new battlegrounds.</p>
<h3>American Planes Attack Germany in Broad Daylight; 91 Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (German News Agency dispatch) - According to German military authorities, American planes attacked central Germany and Brussels on the 12th, causing considerable damage to the civilian population. In the aerial combat, German planes and anti-aircraft guns shot down a total of 91 enemy aircraft. Last night, British planes attacked the northern coastal areas of Germany and Belgium, and 13 were shot down. The continuous bombing of the western occupied territories by British and American planes can be seen as preparations for the invasion of Europe. From May 1st to May 10th, a total of 182 enemy aircraft were shot down, of which 120 were four-engine bombers.</p>
<h3>Turkey Suspends Shipment of Chromium Ore; Germany Lodges Protest</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Regarding Turkey's ban on the export of chromium ore to Germany, the German government issued a statement on the 12th, stating that Turkey's action violates the trade agreement. The German foreign affairs authorities met with a delegation of reporters at noon on the 13th and said that Ambassador Papen was negotiating with Turkey on the matter, and that the content of the talks could not be disclosed in detail due to diplomatic considerations.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Launches Psychological Warfare Against Small Countries; Attempts at Coercion and Inducement Fail</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the appointment of Eisenhower as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, there have been various rumors about the opening of a second front. On the 12th of this month, they jointly issued a new psychological warfare-style advice to Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland, demanding that they immediately break away from the Axis powers. The declaration was simultaneously released by the US State Department, the British Foreign Office, and the Soviet Bureau, and its main points are as follows: 1. The people of all countries should immediately abandon the war and stop assisting and cooperating with the German army, so that the burden on the people of all countries can be reduced. 2. If the people of all countries cannot quickly break away from the German army and continue to cooperate with the German army, the result will be even more unfavorable to the people of all countries, and the future of the people of all countries will be even more unimaginable. Although the anti-Axis forces have exhausted their means of appeasement and suppression, launching a psychological offensive against the Axis powers, the Axis countries that are striving to uphold European civilization and build a new European order will never slacken their resolve. It is expected that the anti-Axis powers will continue to resort to similar base means in the future.</p>
<h3>Wartime Impressions of a Fortress in the Southern Theater</h3>
<p>At a time when the enemy's all-out counterattack is becoming increasingly fierce, Sumatra is Japan's lifeline in the southern theater, both in terms of its location and in terms of the inexhaustible resources hidden within it. Recently, a reporter inspected a portion of the island's most important areas. The following is a record of what I saw and heard:</p>
<p>Driving into the Oil Field</p>
<p>On a certain day in a certain month, at 11:10 AM, we departed from a certain location and drove through a jungle lined with rubber trees, coconut trees, and chocolate trees, followed by a flat road. Before 1:00 PM, we arrived at a certain oil production area, the first stop on our journey. We visited the garrison office and listened to a conversation with a certain lieutenant.</p>
<p>It is said that the oil here is of very high quality. The crude oil that gushes out of the ground can be refined without much effort and supplied to aircraft. Moreover, the location of the oil field, the oil refinery, and the export port for transporting oil to Japan and other nearby occupied territories are all scattered and not concentrated in one place. From a defense standpoint, this is ideal. Several iron pipes are laid from the oil refinery to the port, and oil is continuously transported through these pipes. For example, if one of them is bombed and damaged by enemy aircraft, it is extremely easy to restore it to its original state, making it even more secure.</p>
<p>We left the area at 2:30 PM and headed to another location. The winding roads were all paved with asphalt, which made us feel even more that this place, being an oil-producing area, had always focused on automobiles for transportation.</p>
<p>Stretchers Made with Local Materials</p>
<p>On a certain day in a certain month, the local garrison, centered on the medical corps, gathered fourteen or fifteen non-commissioned officers through the mediation of Lieutenant Tomita before noon and held a symposium. All the attendees had been away from their home country for several years, having fought in battlefields from the mainland to Malaya. They talked freely about their heroic achievements, forgetting even the time for lunch, and did not disperse until nearly 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Since being deployed on the front line of Sumatra's defense, this unit has been collecting local materials and, based on abundant experience and research, has produced thousands of stretchers, which have been distributed to various units to transport the wounded and sick to the rear in the event of an enemy counterattack. Several Australian prisoners of war, under the supervision of this unit, were transferred elsewhere after several months. A farewell performance was held for the prisoners, showing the warmth and unique characteristics of this medical unit, which also boosted the morale of other units.</p>
<p>Praiseworthy Volunteer Corps</p>
<p>On a certain day in a certain month, we departed from a certain location and arrived at another location three hours later. We visited the headquarters of the guard unit and, guided by Lieutenant Kato, met the unit commander. It is said that none of the local residents do not admire the power of the Japanese army. A lieutenant said: "I often tell my subordinates that you must cherish the natives. The Dutch only insulted them in the past and did not care for them, so the residents could never sincerely obey." These words truly contain appropriate meaning. The total length is about ten kilometers.</p>
<p>Great Effort in Building Fortifications</p>
<p>According to the unit commander, the construction of fortifications was a painstaking effort. For example, the iron barbed wire strung along the coast would be washed away by the tide at night during the work, or half buried in sand, or washed away by the waves, and we would have to start all over again the next day. Covering bunkers and various gun emplacements was also very difficult. Those decorated with grass leaves must first be inspected and checked from the sea, and also from the air. However, all the adverse conditions were overcome by the Japanese military spirit. Now, the impregnable iron wall is ready for the Japanese army to land on the beach and leave the enemy corpses on the coast.</p>
<p>Sincere Cooperation of the Natives</p>
<p>On a certain day in a certain month, our car sped along, kicking up a cloud of dust. To the right was a cliff several tens of feet high. Suddenly, looking down the coast, we saw vast waves roaring. To the left were overlapping mountains and an ancient dense forest. In front of the car, wild monkeys or six-foot-long lizards scuttled across the road and disappeared into the grass. Soon, we reached a flat area with simple houses dotting the landscape. Along the road the reporter traveled, there were natives everywhere, repairing damaged roads or bridges in groups of several people. When they saw the car, they shouted "Nippon" and saluted, imitating the military's salute. Smiles appeared on their faces, and their hearts were sincerely cooperating with Japan.

<h3>Japanese Residents in Shanghai Hold Memorial Service for Marshal Koga; Solemn Ceremony Held in Hongkou Park</h3>
<p>The memorial service for the late Japanese Navy Admiral Marshal Koga was solemnly held by the Shanghai Japanese Residents' Association at Hongkou Park yesterday (13th) at 10:00 AM. The commander of the Shanghai Marine Corps and the Director of the Fleet Press also personally participated. The Navy band played music on the spot, creating a solemn and passionate atmosphere. The Shanghai Japanese Residents' Association, in view of the late Marshal Koga's heroic sacrifice and his indelible contributions to the defense of East Asia, held a solemn memorial service on time. First, Mr. Matsuura, the representative of the Republic of China, delivered the opening speech. Then, the representatives of the local Baojia offered sacrifices. Then, the Chairman of the Anpei Residents' Association expressed his determination to defeat the enemy British and Americans. Finally, Director Matsushima delivered a speech, which was full of encouragement. The service lasted two hours.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Post Office Announces Increased Postage Rates; Postal Authorities Discuss Postal Losses</h3>
<p>Regarding the increased postage surcharge, the Ministry of Construction had previously submitted to the National Government for approval the new surcharge of 200% on the basic postage listed in the rate tables for each type of mail: First Class (delivery within the local jurisdiction of each post office), Second Class (domestic inter-office mail), Fourth Class (Japan, Korea, Kwantung Leased Territory, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), and Fifth Class (Macau and Guangzhou Bay), and their original surcharges. The Shanghai Postal Administration officially announced the implementation yesterday (13th).</p>
<p>Statement by Postal Authorities</p>
<p>Since the last increase in the postage surcharge, the post office originally expected the postal economy to improve. However, in the past six months, prices have soared again and again, and postal transport costs have increased sharply. The post office's losses have increased daily. If remedial measures are not taken urgently, there will be a risk of bankruptcy. The Ministry of Construction had to request the Executive Yuan to increase the current postage by two times from the 16th of this month. Considering the current prices and the cost of postal operations, it is indeed impossible to lower it further. This is to minimize the burden on the public as much as possible while making up for postal losses. In addition, the outside world often asks about the declining speed of postal delivery. The main reason is that the current transportation conditions are not as smooth as before, which affects the transportation of mail. However, the postal authorities will continue to urge their subordinates to make extra efforts to ensure speed and accuracy, in order to meet public expectations.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Issues Order Prohibiting Illegal Levies Along Inland Rivers</h3>
<p>Inland river shipping companies have reported that irregular tax levies are often found along inland rivers, and have petitioned the central government to ban them. An investigation reveals that this phenomenon is sufficient to reduce the efficiency of navigation administration, not only hindering transportation but also affecting the important national policy of facilitating the transportation of materials during wartime. It is imperative to strictly prohibit such levies. The municipal government yesterday issued special orders to the relevant bureaus and departments under its jurisdiction, ordering them to strictly prohibit such levies without delay, in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and maintain navigation administration. The deadline is the 15th. Overdue cases will be punished according to regulations. Within this extension period, residents of your district can go to the Finance Department of the First District Public Office at 117 Jiangxi Road to collect materials and receipts. Do not delay further.</p>

It is now known that the Education Bureau, in order to promote the implementation of this measure from this month and to avoid abuses, has carefully formulated one type of "Guidelines for the Collection of Living Assistance Endowments for Teachers and Staff in Municipal Primary and Secondary Schools" and one type of "Guidelines for the Collection of Living Assistance Endowments for Teachers and Staff in Private Primary and Secondary Schools", which have been submitted to the government for record and have been communicated to all schools for compliance. The two guidelines are listed separately below:</p>
<p>Shanghai Special Municipality Guidelines for the Collection of Living Assistance Fees for Teachers and Staff in Private Primary and Secondary Schools</p>
<p>Private primary and secondary schools should follow the Shanghai Special Municipality's Donation Method for Living Assistance Fees for Teachers and Staff in Public and Private Primary and Secondary Schools to handle the collection of living assistance fees for teachers and staff in their respective schools. Private primary and secondary schools (hereinafter referred to as "schools") should, before collecting living assistance fees for teachers and staff (hereinafter referred to as "assistance fees") from students' parents, closely contact local people and students' parents in the vicinity to discuss and determine the monthly donation amount for each parent. Students' parents should fill out a "Living Assistance Fee Donation Confirmation" (format attached) and keep it on file at the school. Before May 25th, the school should report a list of parents' confirmed living assistance fees (format attached) to the bureau for record. The principle is that the assistance fees for the three months of May, June, and July of this year should be collected by each school in one go by the end of May. For the sake of facilitating the collection of fees by schools quickly and saving procedures, schools are temporarily allowed to print their own receipts according to the three-part receipt sample issued by the bureau, affix the school's seal, and submit it to the bureau for inspection and stamping before they are allowed to use them (if a school's living assistance fee receipt is found without being inspected and stamped by the Education Bureau, it will be subject to punishment). However, after the donation has been collected, each school should still submit the receipt stubs, together with a list, to the bureau for record. (Note) Receipt inspection and stamping procedures: 1. The serial numbers of the three-part receipts should be based on each school as a unit, and each school must use a certain character from the school's name as No. 1 to No. 0, which should be determined by each school itself. Each book is limited to 50 pages. 2. Each school should prepare a document together with the blank three-part receipts for the living assistance fee and send them directly to the Secretariat of the Bureau for inspection and stamping, and issue a temporary receipt. Pick it up the next day with the receipt the next day to pick up the stamped receipt. 3. When each school submits the receipts, the personnel in charge of sealing should count them and register them at any time. The person claiming the receipts should sign and stamp the receipt. Each school should deposit the living assistance fees collected each day in the name of the school's teachers' living assistance fee account, with the consent of the school's financial audit committee, into the Fuxing Bank or another bank, but it is not allowed to use it until the school affairs meeting has resolved the distribution plan. Of the assistance fees collected by each school, 90% of the total monthly amount should be used to subsidize the living expenses of teachers and staff on average, and 10% should be used to subsidize the school's office expenses. After each school deposits the collected assistance fees into the bank, it should immediately convene a school affairs meeting in accordance with the above standards to discuss and determine the distribution plan, and submit a report on the individual situation of the teachers and staff to be distributed to the bureau for record. If each school has any suggestions for changing the distribution standard of assistance fees due to special circumstances, it must submit a school income and expenditure report, attach sufficient reasons, and submit it to the bureau for approval and implementation after deliberation and resolution by the school affairs meeting or the school board. The collection and distribution of assistance fees by each school should be audited by the school's financial audit committee to verify the income and expenditure accounts (the bureau has issued a training order No. 4 of the Education Department to all public primary and secondary schools on January 10th of this year, requiring them to follow the regulations of the Ministry of Education for primary and secondary schools from this semester, and uniformly ask the principal to inform the full-time teachers to publicly elect three to five people to form a financial audit committee to take turns serving as chairman, responsible for auditing the school's income and expenditure accounts, and hold a meeting once a month), and the list of committee members should be reported to the bureau for record before the end of May of this year. If a school falsely reports the collection of assistance fees, or changes the distribution standard without permission, or underpays the living expenses of the staff, the donors or teachers and staff may file a complaint to the bureau, and if the bureau finds it to be true after investigation, it will be punished. The above four items of separate transfer amounts will be approved and implemented by the bureau at any time. After each school receives the living assistance fee from the bureau, it should distribute it to all employees within three days. The standard for the distribution of assistance fees to all employees should be based on the principle of equal distribution according to the number of employees, but each school worker should be calculated according to half the number of full-time teachers, and each school principal should be calculated according to two full-time teachers (including collection fee office expenses). Elementary school directors and senior grade teachers should be calculated according to 1.2 people. Elementary school Japanese teachers and other full-time teachers should be calculated according to one person. Part-time Japanese teachers shall not receive concurrent payments. Part-time middle school teachers should calculate the part-time allowance according to the ratio of their teaching hours to the teaching hours of full-time teachers (for example, if a full-time junior high school teacher should teach 18 hours per week, and a certain part-time teacher only teaches 6 hours per week, then it should be calculated as one-third of a person, but it should not be less than one-quarter of a person). Full-time teachers and Japanese-Japanese teachers or staff should be calculated according to one person. After each school has distributed the auxiliary allowance, it shall prepare a distribution report showing the distribution and report to the Bureau for record. The collection and distribution of assistance fees by each school shall be reported by the principal to the school affairs meeting. If there is any false reporting or unauthorized change in the distribution method, the donors or teachers and staff may file a complaint with the Bureau, and the Bureau shall investigate and verify the facts and punish them. The living assistance fees for teachers and staff recognized by social parties other than the neutral primary and secondary schools shall be handled by the Bureau by setting a deadline for consolidation.</p>
<p>Shanghai Special Municipality Guidelines for the Collection of Living Assistance Fees for Teachers and Staff in Municipal Primary and Secondary Schools</p>
<p>Municipal primary and secondary schools should follow the Shanghai Special Municipality's Donation Method for Living Assistance Fees for Teachers and Staff in Public and Private Primary and Secondary Schools to handle the collection of living assistance fees. Municipal primary and secondary schools (hereinafter referred to as "schools") should, before collecting living assistance fees for teachers and staff (hereinafter referred to as "assistance fees") from students' parents, closely contact local people and students' parents in the vicinity to discuss and determine the monthly donation amount for each parent. Students' parents should fill out a "Living Assistance Fee Donation Confirmation" and keep it on file at the school. Before May 25th, the school should first report a list of parents' confirmed living assistance fees to the bureau for verification. The principle is that the assistance fees for the three months of May, June, and July of this year should be collected by each school in one go by the end of May. After collecting the fees, the school should give one copy of the three-part receipt issued by the bureau to the parents who donated (or donors who are not students' parents), keep one copy at the school, and keep one copy of the stub (the stub should be submitted to the bureau together with a list after the funds are collected). Each school should deposit the assistance fees collected in the name of the school's teachers' living assistance fee account (Municipal School Teachers and Staff Living Assistance Fee) into the Fuxing Bank (the intersection of Henan Road and Sanma Road) or any of the following offices of the bank before the end of May of this year: 1. The South District Office of Fuxing Bank (the intersection of Taishan Road and Madang Road, formerly Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet), 2. The North District Office of Fuxing Bank (inside the Zhabei Central Market), 3. The West District Office of Fuxing Bank (the intersection of Jing'an Temple and Yuwei Road). However, when withdrawing money, it should be paid with the seal designated by the Municipal Education Bureau. Each school should complete the collection and deposit of the assistance fee for this semester before the end of May of this year. If there are special circumstances and it is necessary to postpone part of the collection, in addition to depositing the received part once before the end of May, the remaining funds should be completed before June 15th. After each school remits the funds to the bank, it should send the bank's remittance report (format attached) by mail registered on the same day to the bureau for collection or send it by special delivery for preparation for verification and distribution. If each school can collect all the assistance fees and remit them to the bank before the end of May, the three months of assistance fees collected will be verified and issued to each school for collection in June; otherwise, they should be verified and issued to each school for collection in two installments in June and July. The total amount of assistance fees collected by each school, in addition to deducting the total amount of receipt printing fees, should be 90% of the assistance fees collected by each school to be used as the living expenses of the staff of the school, and 10% should be used as the following expenses: A, Transfer the living assistance fee for the staff of the school with the least income, B, Transfer the living assistance fee for the staff of the social education institutions that have not collected assistance fees, D, Transfer the bonus for schools with particularly excellent collection results.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Wartime Wastefulness is Shameful</h3>
<p>We have repeatedly pointed out that during this wartime, we should absolutely practice thrift and economical living. Taking banquets as an example, their purpose may be to gather and discuss affairs, or to connect emotionally. In principle, they are still necessary and should not be overly criticized. However, the form of banquets must adapt to the meaning of wartime thrift. Because wartime wastefulness is most shameful. Therefore, we strongly advocate that all banquets should be mainly tea and snacks. A cup of clear tea and a plate of simple snacks can equally express intentions and achieve the purpose of gathering and connecting. Expensive coffee and abundant sandwiches are unnecessary waste.</p>
<p>Secondly, if there is a need for a meal, then it should be mainly simple food. A few dishes of home-style dishes can also equally express intentions and achieve the purpose of chatting. As for messy plates and a table full of grand dishes, it is also unnecessary. Drinking alcohol at noon is even more strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Looking at the abolition of high-end Japanese bars in Hongkou, it is even more of a declaration to practice thrift. We hope that Chinese people, whether as hosts or guests, must be self-conscious and pay attention to thrift. At the same time, we feel that public officials (of course, referring to high-ranking officials) must be even more thrifty in banquets. As hosts, they should be thrifty, and as guests, they should also be thrifty, declining lavish banquets. They must also consider the preciousness of official time, because numerous banquets can take up time and delay work.</p>
<p>Finally, invitation cards should also be thrifty. Simply write down the time on a piece of white paper. Elaborate paper and beautiful printing are wasteful.</p>

<p>Social Services Fu You Yuan Holds Third Fundraising Campaign</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fu You Yuan in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, is recently facing financial exhaustion and difficulties in providing for its residents.

<h3>Landlord Increases Rent: The Problem of Subtenants' Allocation</h3>
<p>My residence is currently located on a certain street on Xinchang Road. Recently, the landlord has doubled the rent, and the secondary landlord has also ordered us three subtenants to pay double the rent accordingly. This kind of situation, where everything rises with the tide, seems quite reasonable at first glance. However, according to Shanghai's common practice, the rent for subtenants generally includes rent, property tax, utilities, miscellaneous fees, and the secondary landlord's legal profit. Since only the rent has been increased this time, it is reasonable to first deduct the various expenses from the subtenants' monthly rent, and then double the rent alone, or add the amount newly increased by the landlord, plus a legal profit, and then divide it equally between the secondary landlord and the subtenants, which would be fair. However, the secondary landlord insists on not calculating it this way, and if we argue with them, they threaten to refuse to accept the rent. In this way, the secondary landlord not only suffers no loss from the rent increase by the landlord, but can also increase their income, while those who suffer are entirely us subtenants. How can this be considered fair? (A Subtenant)</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Takao's workplace was the advertising department of the Parisian Cosmetics store on Ginza Street. His job was to paint the patterns on cosmetic bottles and advertising illustrations according to the instructions of the department head, Deka. The work itself was quite bland, but his colleagues were all pretentious and arrogant types posing as artists. Takao now knew more about the temperament of the upper class and the airs of painters than he did when he was at the Ichiki's house. At the same time, the gallery in the Parisian Cosmetics retail department often held solo exhibitions of Western paintings, so he became acquainted with many painters. Tsuruhara Keiichi, who treated him to roast chicken, was one of them.</p>
<p>Although Takao learned about various new painting styles and techniques, his own work was not affected in any way. In his apartment in Koenji, he continued to work hard on Sundays and at night, but he remained an old-fashioned painter. He deserved the recognition of the Ichiki painter, but Takao himself could not feel satisfied.</p>
<p>That spring, his work was selected for the first time at the Spring Nikakai Exhibition. Fearing that people in his hometown would find out, he submitted his work anonymously. For some reason, his delicate work received considerable praise in the eyes of art critics at newspapers.</p>
<p>This gave him courage, and he decided to submit his work to the Autumn Bunten Exhibition. The Ichiki painter also greatly encouraged him. Assuming he was selected for the Bunten, he would use this opportunity to write a letter to his sister Eda, apologize to his parents, and then return to his long-abandoned hometown. At the same time, his conscription age was approaching. Even if he was selected and examined in Tokyo, he would still need the understanding of his parents. (Even though he is not yet an established painter, he has reached this point through self-study. Returning to his hometown would not be disgraceful. If he could be selected for the Bunten, perhaps his father would recognize him as an accomplished artist and forgive him.)</p>
<p>He felt that there was light ahead and was about to paint when his heart suddenly felt like it had been stabbed with a knife and began to ache dully.</p>
<p>The reason was a question raised by someone in the advertising department when he started painting.</p>
<p>"Is it okay for us to be painting pictures like this now?"</p>
<p>This became the center of conversation among his colleagues.</p>
<p>"Taking this opportunity, we must work harder and study the beauty of nature."</p>
<p>"Aren't painters also members of the nation? It is right for us to take up the paintbrush instead of a gun to fight on the front lines."</p>
<p>"Then, at this time, current affairs paintings participating in exhibitions would be the most appropriate works."</p>
<p>"No, it can't be said that that's all there is to it. However..."</p>
<p>The discussion continued without scope or limit.</p>
