<h3>文化運動與文化人</h3>
<p>文化運動，可以說是一切運動的動力，尤其在非常時代，特別需要文化運動，擔負一切啟示宜揚的任務，使人民認識非常時代的面目。目前大東亞正在擊滅英美的決戰時期，中國正在參戰第二年，協力作戰的時期。一切軍事政治經濟措施，都需要文化運動輔助策進，完成非常時代的使命。</p>
<p>從事文化工作者，一般稱之爲文化人，當然文化運動的成效如何，就繫於文化人實際工作的努力如何。文化工作的領域至廣，所以，文化人的範圍也極大。一般的說，因為文化工作，在客觀上都偏於非生產性，非為營利的，所以，文化人的生活總是清寒刻苦的。</p>
<p>上面說過，目前南京國民政府須方一面協力爭取大東亞戰勝，一方面政治革新，誠是任重道遠。因此，需要文化人共同協力者極爲殷切。然而，在和平區內文化工作的遲滯衰落，己爲不可否認的事實。推原共故，不僅是文化人的缺乏，尤共是文化人的生活及環境不良，無從提高工作的精神與效率，爲文化運動致最大之努力。我們試作客覜的分析，目前和平區內文化人感到不安的原因得有數點：</p>
<p>本身生活困難。文化人平素大都不事生產，不善營利，憑籍一枝筆，一張嘴換取生活的。年來物價高漲，漫無止境，而文化人的所入永遠跟不上物價的增加，一身一家的生活重擔，無法肩負，於是有的意志消沉，有的從事別業。</p>
<p>渝共的威脅仇視。重慶以及中共方面的特務人員，對於文化人施以威脅，並加仇視。對於文化人擔任之工作，施以種種破壞。</p>
<p>國府無確切保障。文化人旣受渝共的威脅仇視，而南京國民政府又無確切保障，使文化人有徘徊之感，一方面更受生活壓迫，渙散寥落，自在意中。</p>
<p>文化人在過去朋友之中，不無渝共份子，因此，可能遭遇意外的嫌疑。平時對於本身工作，不免多所顧忌，不能安心，以致影響效能。</p>
<p>有了這樣的原因，和平區內文化人才極爲寥落，於是文化工作散漫，文化水準低落，例如出版物特別减少；可讀的文章，優良的創作，更如鳳毛麟角；學術研究的空氣淡薄，科學上的發明絕無。</p>
<p>針對上列原因，我們盼望政府常局從速設法改善。同時，盼望盟邦當局盡力協助，使文化運動配合戰爭，發生輔佐力量。於此，提供期望數事：</p>
<p>政府對於淸寒文化人的生活，有經常補助辦法·並設置文學獎金，學術獎金等等，獎勵研究興趣，提高文化水準。</p>
<p>政府對於文化人之著作，盡量給予出版機會，鼓勵創作，加强國民對於非常時代的認識。</p>
<p>文化人努力本位工作者，當局應充分信任，並加確切保障·如動輒懷疑，信任不專，必致無人效命，非存敷衍，即不安於位。</p>
<p>和平區內，文化人不能安定的原因，如不亟謀解除，則絕對談不到文化運動；而政治運動如無文化遝動配合爲輔，則絕對不易成功。政府常局應重視文化遝動的重要，使文化人安心服務，爲共同目標而奪鬬！</p>

<h3>日軍掃蕩　平戞渝軍</h3>
<p>仰光八日中央社電　雲南滇緬邊境渝軍，去年十月於怒江作戰受重創後，即行敗退，茲日軍自一月六日以來，復繼續掃蕩傍皇於滇緬國境平憂附近山中，渝軍殘部，至二月二日止，業已掃蕩喊完畢，結果，渝軍棄屍一〇九·被俘五，日方戰死一·輕傷一。</p>
<h3>晋剿匪軍　綜合戰果</h3>
<p>太原八日中央社電　山西剿匪軍，客夏駐蟠龍鎭以來，共軍即遭殲減之打擊，茲誌一月份蟠籠鎭附近地區剿共綜合戰果如次。牧容共軍屍　一三九具，俘虜五八人，鹵獲品計輕機三，步槍六二，手槍三，槍刺十四，及地雷彈藥糧草等甚多。</p>
<h3>敵機盲炸日醫船　大批傳敎士罹難</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地電：美軍之暴　及非人道，屢次盲炸日醫船等事即可證明。且彼等又對日軍庇護下避難之宣敎師，施以非人道之轟炸，其暴性益發暴露無道。爰於新幾內亞島以南居住之外國宣敎師百餘人，最近因美空軍之激烈盲炸，爲這難計，於日軍保護之下向馬那島遷移，然美空軍復對此島亦行盲炸，於是日軍又以駁船將該官敎師等運至　蘭迪阿。六日船駛至威瓦見島海面，不期於是日上午七時二十分美B25型機二十八架突飛至駁船上空施行轟炸。是日天氣晴朗，敵機以超低空飛行再三開槍射擎，船中難民多係婦孺，大部立於甲板上，且婦女服裝大部爲修道士制服，但美空軍由四五十米高空飛來，　出半身開槍掃射，想其自能認請船中乘客非為戰鬥員。日軍勇士雖以力保　難民，但因敵機執拗開檜射擊，致有五十八人立被擊斃，八十員重傷，其他殆全負傷。日陸軍部隊當即將此等負傷者送至附近新軍衛生機關，妥加看護。</p>

<h3>日海軍機隊出擊　屢收獲重大戰果　安本日守軍擊退來襲美機</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某某地電，日海軍機隊對歷次來襲之敵機，非僅予以擊碎，更進而强製敵軍基地及敵　送船團，均獲重大戰果。六日夜日海軍機會於　不列顛皇，新幾內亞島中間海峽發見敵輸送船團，常予以轟炸、收獲甚大戰果。更於常夜攻擊芬希哈罕敵機塲，全彈命中目標物，使兩處起火。另一方面於富夜並急擊新不列顚鳥馬加期角，格羅斯　角方面敵登陸陣地，予以猛烈攻擊，而將之摧毀，關於以上各次攻擊，日機除一架未飛返外，他無捐害。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　據南太平洋日車前終某其基地電，日軍對在新幾內亞宮比角登陸敵軍之攻擊，日趨激烈，二月一日日哨成隊曾廳　摩特河右岸敵營地，炸毀敵幕舍四所，將其中敵軍悉數殺傷。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　西南太平洋日軍某基地訊，美機十四架會於四日夜來襲安本，日守備部隊當與之邀擊，以熾烈之防空砲火將其擊退，日方無損害。</p>
<h3>緬日軍強力反攻　已佔領敦巴扎爾　反軸心國承認作戰困難</h3>
<p>東京入日中央社電　緬甸日軍前錢電，印緬邊區日軍，已於南部展開攻勢，由三面進攻紐夸河及馬猶河中間馬猶山脈地帶之敵軍。爰日軍某部隊，六日黃昏開始猛攻納蓋後庫附近之敵，未幾敵軍即開始向西方退却，同時布其頓西北方十公里之東特烏埃德及該地西方高地之敵軍，亦由納蓋德庫西面之公路後退，日軍當即追擎，獲得莫大戰果。又馬猶河地區之敵軍，六日黃昏亦開始退却，現日軍正追擎中。又向孟多退却中之敵軍後路，已被日軍遮斷，故該地之敵軍已成袋中鼠矣。</p>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　英東南亞細亞司令部七日發表阿拉坎戰綫之戰况如次；　阿拉坎戰綫之日軍，五日以强力反攻，其奇襲部隊乘反軸心軍偵察部隊之不備而進攻，五日已佔領敦巴扎兩，五日晚兩軍陷於混戰，日軍六日在敦巴扎爾西南陸續進攻中。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　據緬甸日軍某基地電：緬印國境全綫之敵軍，於印國民軍高呼　我河山與日軍到處痛擊下，已張惶失指，頃更有英印美渝軍自軍之動搖，更形成極度不安，北部緬甸一舉，去年來渝軍鄭洞國部下新綢第卅二師等，曾於話格至夫公之公路一帶活躍，企圖打開所誚「進向東京之路」，但　再遭受日軍之痛擎，受創綦重，棄屍一一七一具，被俘卅七人，損失子彈六九九二八粒。孟多布一月上旬以來，英軍第十四軍部下第七師團及第某師等，亦曾逐步前進呼號奪回日溪等地，但日軍各部隊突行佔領日溪前綫敵第七師團背後之某地猛進。最近駐渝美空軍司令官斯蒂維爾觀察前綫，曾言及北緬國境作戰困雖，一月廿日敵方廣播曾掩飾孟加拉州之飢饉狀態，且警吿謂，印度國民軍如達印度國內時，急向英當局報吿。凡此種種，皆不外爲英當局狼狽之表現，而英軍若干萬精銳，於日溪前方瀕於殲滅之事，將使前綫敵軍之不安益甚</p>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　反軸心於奎貝克會談後，即設置東南亞洲軍司令部，狂吠奪回緬甸，然雨季過後，已三月餘·尙未開始大規模之行動。今日軍爲先機制敵，突然　動攻勢，由於各種事實之明示，耶東南亞洲軍當局亦承認，緬甸反攻作戰不能依豫定計劃進行。頃據每日郵報新德里當局亦認緬甸正式攻擊戰尙需相當時期，然雨季不久將至，故最近能在泰晋戰綫之近陸地帶作局地戰鬬。又英國與東方一週刊，曾於七日就緬甸反攻作戰之遲緩等情論述謂，反軸心各國國民須靜待緬甸反攻作戰之展開，若無較現在更多之裝備與　軍部隊，則不能大規模突破緬甸戰綫，陸上戰鬬所必要之兵力雖有餘裕，然無使用此等兵力之塲所，今後印度軍須與渝軍設法取得蓮絡，蒙特巴頓須克服地理環境之惡劣條件，若不能於孟加拉灣運用大規模之海軍力，則陸上英軍活動仍受限制。</p>
<h3>馬猶山戰事　實具重要性　日軍事專家發表談話</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　據此間軍事專家談，此次緬印邊境作戰之意義稱：印緬邊境日軍，本月四日突由布其頓正面發動攻勢，在海拔一萬尺叢林密布峽密疊聳之馬猶山脈山地，繼續挺進，已着着收獲預期之戰果。同時，自由印度國民軍，亦協力日軍突破一切障碍，向德里邁進，從谷方面言，此次戰爭，在大東亞戰時之現階段，實有轉機之重要性。茲略分述其意義如次：　此次作戰，係日軍先發動者，故戰局之指導權，乃在日軍，此已證明日軍現雖在太平洋與美軍展開戰史罕有之激戰，但遇有必要時，則有隨時隨地發動攻勢之戰力。英國之奸思較美國尤甚，圖先使日·美在太平洋上相搏，使大西洋戰局發展有利時，再在亞洲東南部發動攻勢·特巴頓以最近太平洋戰局判斷英美軍行動之時機已至，乃在緬印邊境準備活動，企圖以英美之夾擊，形成對日總反攻，但其企圖已因日軍先發制人開始總攻，而遭受重大挫折。蒙特已頓反攻之主要目標，在奪回或破壞日軍戰力培養地之南方資源地域，但日軍此次作戰，進展之神速，已粉碎敵方此種野望，使南方資源圈更形鞏固。敵企圖反攻緬甸之一大原因，即欲開通北緬至渝通路，但日軍此次開始新作戰後，此種企圖又遭挫折，美國對開通緬渝通路期望最嚴，美國期由此路綫增强援渝力量提高在中國建築第二戰綫之力量，並積極擴充美駐渝空軍，圖實現空襲日本本土之野心，以牽制日軍之太平洋戰綫，故美國對於駐印度渝軍三師兵力，配備以美國式裝備及美軍指導將校。最近更擬統轄滇渝軍，傳美渝雙方刻正交涉移交該省渝軍之指揮權事宜，蓋美國之用意，原欲犧牲渝軍，以開通北緬通渝通路，渝方亦認爲打開現在窮境之唯一出路，即在實現北緬通路，俾取得英美之接濟物資，故不暇細想，已有聽從美國意見之意，幷欲於英印軍反攻緬甸時，命令滇省渝軍發動反攻，以策應美軍，本年新春以來，滇省渝軍及夫谷地區駐印渝軍·曾相互策應，企圖總反攻汳汲於確保將來之反攻據點·但日軍在緬印南部國境進擊渝軍·此種企圖已生破綻，日眾防衛之周密，實使渝軍無蠢動餘地，結果，美國希望開通北緬赴渝路綫，以解救渝方之困窮及增强中國第二戰綫之計劃，成空想而已·　此次作戰，自由印度國民軍與緬甸國軍均協力日軍，幷肩而戰·共同進攻，爲長堪注目之點。日東條首相於一月二十一日之施政演說中謂，江特拉鮑斯於印度一角，高舉獨立之旗，爲求印度自由而奮起，日政府今後决傾全力，積極予以援助，是乃日本對印度之解放，已表明其强　援助之决意。今印度國民軍於日軍之支援下，為實現其解放祖國之宿願，已開始進向德里總攻。又日軍爲解放東亞脫　英美人之桎梏，對新生緬甸之國軍，亦予以全面協力，目前日緬印三軍，憶連成　系，刻正對蒙特巴頓軍縮　包圍網，故馬　山脈之戰爭，實具重要性。</p>
<h3>印國民軍進駐　阿拉坎山野　建軍本則本條已宣佈</h3>
<p>緬甸八日中央社電　印度國民軍一月七日移駐緬甸後，即待機向祖國進發，茲其渴望之時機已到，故毅然與日軍協力，開始爭取自由之戰爭，是故印度之解放，已開始具初程矣，茲特將印度國民軍建軍之本則介紹於後：　印度國民軍爲印度人自體之軍隊。　國民軍屬於印度臨時政府下，對祖國誓盡忠誠，以團結信義爲信條，集結總力於打倒英國之目標下，貫澈祖國獨立。　基於精兵主義，僅以優秀者組織之。印國民軍總司令爲鮑斯，其參謀爲　斯列。兵員總數計若干，不拋棄宗敎的對立及民族之歧視，而解放祖國之目標共濟而進，即拉克西米婦人部長指揮之女子部隊，亦參加戰列。全東亞之印度人，茲已倔然而起，以國民軍爲中核，進駐阿拉坎山野，印度民衆，今後之活躍頗値期待。</p>
<h3>盤谷北郊空襲</h3>
<p>盤谷入日中央社電　數B24型轟炸機數架，五日晨來襲盤谷，當即遭日泰兩軍戰斗機及地上砲米之痛烈　擊，　向　谷市對岸之敦普里市內及盤谷市北郊投下炸彈約四十枚，倉皇遁走，泰方損害甚微。</p>
<h3>華北舉行　宣傳會議</h3>
<p>北京八日中央社電　華北政務委員會，為確立華北戰時宣傳體制，強化農業增產宣傳，特召開三十三年度華北春季宣傳分議，會期定為四五兩日，在情報局會議室舉行。</p>
<h3>滿駐日大使返任</h3>
<p>新京八日中央社電　滿駐日大使王允卿氏，前返國述職，茲以任務完畢，業於八日午後四時由滿啓程返任。</p>
<h3>歐洲要塞的攻防戰　朝日新聞座談會</h3>
<p>朝日新聞社英美如眞以本年爲决戰年，則一定要開闢與東部戰綫相呼應的第二戰綫。去年十一月末德黑蘭會談中的英美蘇共同聲明，英·美·蘇一關於從東·西·及南三面同時進攻德國在其規模與時期上，意見完全一致。」所以到現在爲止還沒有實施的「從西方進攻「，大約即將有所行動。間題在於英美從何時何地開始。這就是緊張的歐洲戰局之最高峰。英美蘇極守秘密的第二戰綫之時期與塲所，各地的觀測如何呢？</p>
<p>烟中特派員（莫斯科）蘇聯報紙，蘇聯人民，都催促英美從速開闢第二戰錢。但第二戰綫的主導權，在於英美方面，所以蘇聯報紙與人民關於第二戰綫的種種預測，儘量避免，故而預測第二戰綫的時期與地點，是非常困難的。但一般人似乎都相信，英美實行侵略西歐時，英美軍將同時在法國，比利時，挪威等大西洋海岸登陸，至其時期，將窺伺能發揮最大的效果之機會，實施有組織的協同作戰。</p>
<p>田口特派員（沮利希）反軸心軍進攻歐洲的時期，將在目前反軸心軍積極轟炸德國運輸網之後，大約白二月中旬起始將逐漸實現。但其金童全視東部戰綫動靜及空炸的效果這二個要因。例如第一個要因的東部戰線，假使見到對紅軍非常有利的決定轉變時，進攻戰也將迅速地被促進。進攻戰的主要舞合是歡洲西岸與巴爾幹。面在南法及挪威的登陸戰大約是牽制戰的性質。</p>
<p>渡邊特派員（瑞典京城）邱吉爾·羅斯福二人在德異　會談中答應斯太林開關第二戰綫，但他們的話不作數的很多。英美方面的宣傳稱，今有二百萬大軍在英國本土從事侵人西歐的準備。報紙上說英軍的兵力在英本土有英重五十個師，美軍五十至一百個師，北非有英軍二十至三十個師，特戈爾軍十師，更在敘利亞有英軍三十個師。英美軍的進攻西歐，已經整頓了隨時隨地可以開始的凖備，現在只是在等待開始的時機。</p>
<p>進攻的塲所，有種種臆測。一前在牽制的意義上，在　地同時實施小規模的登陸戰，問　在於侵入軍的主力究在何處在意大利的北部有阿兒卑斯的天險，在法國地中海海岸也有阿爾卑斯與中部山地間的諾努河溪谷的掣肘，至於以挪威爲主要戰場則太遠。</p>
<p>另一方面，巴爾幹的地理條件，屢傳擬利用不能威脅德國國內戰綫的　特與米哈洛維契的游擊部隊以進攻巴爾幹。然現在巴爾幹所進行的游繫戰，不能算作是眞正的軍事行動·未來的巴爾幹作戰，結果也將成爲與義大利作戰一樣的「蝸牛戰術」。因此：目前視爲最可能的進攻地點乃是從荷蘭，比利時至北法的英法海峽方面。（未完）（翅：譯自二月二一日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>東綫戰事焦點　移尼科波爾　維特勃斯克續有激戰</h3>
<p>柏林入日中央社電　東部戰綫自一月後，戰局之焦點會集巾於列寗格勒之洞爾赫夫，由該方面開始之蘇軍北部政勢，於波羅的國境綫曾一時停止。二月初旬以來，又移其焦點至聶伯河下流地帶之尼科波爾（nikoho）橋頭堡地區。德軍去年十月因克里曼卓格方面蘇軍之聶伯河突破作戰，曾拋棄該河中流之右岸，而改守　鐵產地克里伏洛格及錳鑛產地尼科波爾。此次蘇軍自尼普貝特羅夫斯克方面柴普魯基方面聶伯河南岸，三方面包圍此聶伯河套，德軍當局亦承認戰局重大，而表明死守尼科波爾市。聶伯河套之運命，全繫於德軍能否堅守尼科波爾，故此次之戰局，頗堪注目。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　據海通社訊：維特勃斯克蘇軍昨再度猛攻，僅獲得局部之突破，惟死傷累累，至晚間又傾師來犯，仍被擊退。尼維爾之北，敵圖擴展共所突破之陣錢，終吿失敗。那爾瓦地峽附近及克里伏索四週，蘇軍小事進攻未逞，德軍在地峽之南則續有推進。東綫北路戰局，大致未有變更。普利貝特及尼科波兩以南蘇　力增加，蘇快速部隊及騎兵昨在克里曼卓格以北之平原上向西推進，卒彼德軍所阻，激戰未己。東綫南路氣候溫暖，氣候約在零度以上十六度左右，且不時降雨，故地而殊爲泥濘，作戰甚爲困難，大聶伯河套一帶無異一大泥淖。</p>
<h3>羅馬南英美軍　轉攻為守　德軍佈弧形包圍陣</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　南義納吐諾登陸之反軸心軍，曾企圖進攻羅馬，因遭凱震林元帥部下德精銳之猛攻，大受挫折，乃改攻勢為守勢，圖努力維持旣得陣地。刻德軍更以坦克車部隊切斷安奇奧至阿爾巴諾之公路，以殲滅突出阿普里亞之英軍，反軸心軍戰綫已陷入混亂狀態。該方面德軍非特確保與羅馬之連絡。更陸續調集精兵，以强化阿爾迭亞·阿普里亞·齊斯迭那各地，對納吐　橋頭堡佈成之弧形包圍綫。近傳德軍一精銳師團已開抵該方，料凱塞林元帥將以機械化部隊　間大反攻。</p>
<p>卡西諾綫竟日激戰</p>
<p>又卡西諾戰綫，兩軍仍在該市周邊　續激戰，刻德軍已完全掌握該市。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德元首行營發表：　卡西諾西北之美軍，終日以大兵力來襲，德軍與之　成衝鋒戰，予以大損害後將之擊退。</p>
<h3>英美對中立國　不斷施壓力　企圖干涉西班牙內政</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德國新聞社昨夜獲悉：倫敎「觀察者報」對西班牙又作一猛烈之攻　，其不獨要求西班牙對國際政治上之保證，且要求西國內部機構之改組。在評論此項攻勢時，柏林政界視爲極端嚴重，因此要求乃對西班牙之正式宣佈而發，且含有對西政府答覆之意味，「觀察者報」向以立論溫和見稱，該報之政洽論文多有影嚮於英外交部，此種攻擊巳完全澄淸局勢，而顯示英駐西大使霍爾所玩之牌矣。此文證明英美對西國中立之攻擎，不過爲英美干涉西國內政之藉口而已。</p>
<p>阿格蘭八日中央社電　那洛特報評論英美蜀中立國定之攻擊稱，其最近對中立國所施之　力·僅為實現德黑蘭會　之決議而已，土耳其乃第一個受到攻擊之中立國，而西班牙乃其後繼者，而土西兩國之態度，不能爲反軸心國之利益而有所讓步。</p>
<h3>英美對軸心國　準備心理戰</h3>
<p>日內瓦八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，華盛頓息：美戰爭情報局長台雜斯宣稱：該局已派歇　伍特赴倫敦，以便對職心國展開「心理戰」而作種種之佈置。合氏同時宣布該局官員某某等三名之辭職。</p>
<h3>土耳其議員　警告英蘇　勿干預爾幹事</h3>
<p>斯丹埠八日中央社電　土議員亞爾頓素以傾向反軸心稱，著文警吿英國及蘇聯，不得再將巴爾幹各國視爲其勢力範圍，而聽巴爾幹人民自，行主張。並稱，反軸心各國應中止其驅甲以抗乙之狡計。</p>
<h3>芬蘭京城　遭二次空襲</h3>
<p>瑞典京城八日中央社電　蘇空軍於六日晚轟炸赫爾亲其後，於是日夜半至七日三時半之間，又對該市作第二次轟炸。</p>
<h3>都市防空的現階段——關於都市疏散問題——</h3>
<p>對於空隙的認識</p>
<p>西南太平洋方面的空中决戰，日趨劇烈，不但是西南太平洋方面，在中國大陸以及北邊第一綫的日軍，對於敵機的來襲，加緊鞏固防禦，其勇敢挺戰的情形，殊堪感激。</p>
<p>幸而敵機還侵襲日木本土，美國本土的特殊情形，姑且不諭，在交戰中的主要國家，都市沒有受到轟炸的只有日本。不過日本土是在轟炸的安全圈內嗎？敵機可由中國大陸及北方阿留申的根據地，或由航空母鑑飛來空襲，的確的，日本本土是處在危險的狀態。</p>
<p>空中的决戰，並不只在離開本土的地域展開，日本本土亦勢將成爲劇烈的决戰塲，應要覺悟無論何時何種的情形發生。防空的歷史已經過十餘年了。對於防空的活動與設施，比之十年前，有着極大的進步，那是衆所共知的。</p>
<p>然而對於都市的防空却舊態依然，可謂遺憾之至。再由戰局的現階段看來，不禁令人發慄。可依都市的狀况和設施的重要性來排整備防空的緩急次序嗎？不消說；不能因爲資材所定，及有限的預算範圍內，去限制防空的整備工作。</p>
<p>防控的整飭與空襲的判斷</p>
<p>要實施防空的整備，最要緊的是去判斷空襲。空襲的判斷，應委諸專門家，平常的人不能任意判斷，不過要採取平常人的意見，才不致發生意外的結果，這特別是要留意的。當這空襲必來的現階段，京濱，阪神，中京，北九州這四個地方不待　，其餘的令國樞要地方應覺悟免不了相當多數的敵機反復轟炸。美國的反攻作戰，愈形加緊，自然對於從前四·一八那種的奇襲，已覺得不能滿意，那是版其顯然的。所以對於最惡劣的情形，應預先採取最完善的措施了。</p>
<p>由歐洲名國的都市空觀現狀而觀，例如漢堡，柏林，米拉諾等，遭受美英空軍的轟炸狀能，或南方所羅門海上的空中决　情形看來，此後實施空製，乃出動百架或二三百架爲單位的飛機羣。至於用數架或以十餘架飛機海　性的轟炸，此後不在空襲之列了。不，沒有達到相當目的之空襲，不能謂之空襲。空襲與防空是相對的，所以防空設施愈形整備，一方面空襲便漸漸大規模而且劇烈化。　然如巴黎，羅馬，雖宣佈為無設防的都市，但也不能避免空襲。</p>
<p>關於都市的疏散</p>
<p>在都　市防空現階段的主要題題，就是都市疏散的問題了。日本在防空上的最大缺點是：在乎形成着龐大密集之市街地，及各種國家機形，集</p>
<p>都市，以及不造舖屋的集合。</p>
<p>都市，特別要疏散市街地，這是根本的問題，尤其是東京，更應把各種重複的機能，例如政治，經濟，文化，生產等的機關迅速地予以分散，使其性能單純化，這是絕不可缺的措施。豈不是因爲增强生產，强化經濟統制，缺乏責材勞力，沒有提到都市疏散的問題？原來防空是消極的，非生產的，但爲要保護國土，亦在所不顯，必須積極地强化都市的防空。</p>
<p>都市疏散的問題，不獨在防空上能够發生效果，多年來所說的大都市之　害，亦能得到救濟·至於因爲大都市的疏散，一時雖會發生非生產性的問題，但這可以由別的方面，或另一時期去補救。</p>
<p>都市疏散問題所包含的範圍，極其廣汎。亦多與人口疏散的問題相關聯，在這裏只談到設施的疏散與機能的分散，施如果沒存疏散，即人口的疏散，亦不過是紙上的計畫而已。</p>
<p>所謂是把，原來賓集的市特地·或把集中在都市的機能分散配置，改造為許多空地的市街，或將都市的負担使之輕減。所以包含都市機關的問題之內容有；一，把密集市街地的家產或工廠等　移他處，改造空地旣多而建築物又疏散的市街。二，把工廠，學校，官公衙等·遷轉到地方，使都市機能單純化而輕減都市自身的負担</p>
<p>由日本的現狀而言·對於密集市街地的疏散，非全面的實行不可。不能說那一坤方比較好。須從空製的危險率比較少，或遭到若干損害亦不得已的地方爲次序，着手實行疏散。從整個國土着來，京　阪神等所謂四大工業地區的都市，應先着手，油漆是於都市內，包含重要工廠的工業地帶，非首先着手不可。</p>
<p>一方面急速整備防空，一方面對於戰時重要資材的生產，不但不能放鬆，而且應盡一切的手段，加以保衛，俾免遭受空襲。所以疏散及整理軍用工廠附近一帶的密集地區，爲當前的急務。同時應設想交換住宅等，在遭遇空襲之際，交通機關停止，工廠的生產亦不免停頓，故必有所準備。一部份的人說，如果疏散重要工廠的周圍，易被認職，反轟炸的目標，對此應圖謀僞裝或其他方法，予以保護。考慮到防火，防彈等問題，莫善於建造空地。</p>
<p>在破壞家屋，或遷移時會碰到物資的缺乏及住宅的缺乏情形，看來雖是矛盾的方法，但在此空襲必來的現階段，能夠輕減被害，同時一樣要使用物資勞力，不如在事件發生以前遷移妥可，較為賢明之策。至於住宅的問題，有關都市機能分散問題，若同時考慮到中小商工業者的企業整飭，或變換大住宅及菜館等的用途，那便相當得到解决吧。（弘課自十二月號航空文化）</p>

<h3>商統分負責人解釋　棉布配給問題　臨時配給正趕訂詳細辦法</h3>
<p>關於棉布臨時配給一事，外間傳說已久，最近又有未經檢收散裝布　，指作配給用途所得配價，即　貨主收取之說。記者為明了　際情形起見，特走訪全國商業統制總會負責人，叩詢一切，茲錄問答情形如下：</p>
<p>問　聞說貴會因紗布收買後，人民作久無布可購，有臨時配給之舉，究竟事實如何？</p>
<p>答　收買紗布一事，本會係受政府委託代辦，一切辦法，均由政府規定，故另設處辦理，以淸權限。現在收買工作已吿完畢，本應即行實施配給，但因集中配給方案，尙待各方彙報資料，綜合研討，擬具基本計劃，呈候政府核定，方可實施。本會爲顧念商民痛苦起見，故有呈准政府特予臨時配給之通融辦法，刻原則已經政府核定，正在日夜趕訂詳細辦法，並與有關機關，往返商討中，不久即可公佈實施。</p>
<p>問　聞說有以未經檢收散裝布　·指作配給用途，所得配給價，即　貨主收取，如此辦理，是否等於不收買？</p>
<p>答　本會代辦收買紗布，一遵政府所頒佈之各項有關條例規章辦理，此種辦法與條例規章不合，本會自未便有所主張，但本會旣為商業集團，凡能為商人向政府請命者，亦無不樂於從事，現聞商人方面，　直接向政府請求，本會自祗有靜候政府命令辦理，更未便表示任何意見。</p>
<p>問　布旣配給，紗又如何？客紗之配給，關係新生產處理，至新生產處理辦注，究應如何規定，太會早已通知紗業布業各公會從速研究，以便據以擬成方案，呈送政　核定，因倘不參酌業內　際情形，貿然擬訂，一經核准公佈，執行固多窒礙，變更尤費周折，故深盼各關係業者早日建議，並盡量發抒意見，以免遷延自誤，並退有後言。</p>
<p>問　聞說此次臨時配給布疋，將仿南京市辦法每戶祗准購一丈五尺，是否屬實？</p>
<p>答　每戶一丈五尺之設，確曾有人提議，但本會呈准政府之原案，係每人一丈五尺，迄未奉另令變更。</p>
<p>最後該會負責人表示：「近來外間常有不問根由，隨意發表言論，不知本會係以商業集體辦理自治統制，旣屬商人之集體機關，則一切有關本業問題，原可由各該業同業公付正式函詢本會，各同業公會亦常本自治統制之精神，盡量爲同業謀幸福，負責任，解痛苦，凡具函來會詢問，本會無不詳爲答復，若不循此進行，而在外間紛擾，於本身問題，仍無裨益，此本會對此不勝其惋惜者也。」</p>

<h3>言評　民族資本之出路</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電稱，東京讚買新聞七日社論，以「中國民族實本之出路「爲題，指出中國民族資本投機化之原因，謂中國之民族資本，不能以原始之儲存制式向　發展，而係以票號錢莊等高利貸資本及匯兌資太爲出發點，致民族資本不能轉化爲產業資本，銀行資本不能把握產業部而結果形成投機資本，妨碍一切建設，故應謀一適當之出路，即須排除一切困難，培養健全之民族工業。原文大意如斯，曾之可謂十分中肯。</p>
<p>以巨額民族資本集中之地點上海而論，因爲資本沒有出路，不能代爲產業資本，所以形成兩種最嚴重的經濟病態，一是投機行爲的犯獗，一是物價無限制的昂騰·自前者而言，例如「現在全上海的市民，甚至薪水階級，敎員，店員，娘姨，工友，無不瘋狂於股票的多頭空頭中。」自後者而言，例如「二星期前售二十二塊錢一條的毛巾，現在是六十五元，售三十塊錢一雙的襪子，現在是七十多元。」這樣下去，上海的經濟病狀，是耍病人膏肓的，因爲，世界上的人類，誰惟恃賭博爲生活？又誰能抵禦這樣一個，生活上的狂濤？</p>
<p>我們在一年以前即曾說過，今後的上海經濟界，爲禍爲福。皆由我上海的金融家企業家自造之，而涵煦保育發榮滋長之責，厥在政府。這句話外似含渾，實則就是針對中國民族資本之出路一個問題，因爲在戰時經濟政策綱領頒布以後，我們不曾說過嗎？我金融家企業家應一致努力於產業的增進，以實現全國有計劃的生產，人人排除私利，放遠眼光，切實認淸當前應負的重要經濟使命。</p>
<h3>大部份物品限價　各業決嚴執行　門市售貨須標明價格</h3>
<p>本市各業同業公會，前曾分別組設一物品評價委員會」，訂定章程，通吿各會員一體運照，昨據記者探悉，各該業評價委員會，鑒於邇來物價漲風　烈，民生不安，乃以責職所在，不忍坐視，爰於日來紛紛召開會議，檢討過去所評物品限價，是否適合標準化，經議决結果，大部份限價，仍維持原狀，不稍寬限，凡同業在門市售出任何物品，必須按照所訂限價，在顯明處所標出，務使每一顧客，易於望見，及辨明淸楚。但其中數類，終因成本關係，將呈請當　變更。</p>
<h3>銀錢業放款　特別審愼</h3>
<p>本市銀錢　各行莊，於新春休假期滿後，均已開市復茉，對於放款業務，一因銀根趨緊，二因去年總結束期各行莊往來欠戶大半均未能如期結淸欠款，故今年開市以來，各行莊放款特予嚴愼辦理，將一部份去年未結淸往來戶暫緩送摺往來，並催結舊賬，以致開春後銀根未見轉鬆，茲悉，各行莊爲調劑金融，扶助正當工商業務發展起見，除一面催還舊欠外對於已經了淸賬款之往來戶，已發　放款業務，惟爲防止工商業利用資金投機囤積，對於請求借款者，特須審愼考慮，非經營正當事準或從事生產借款者决予拒絕貸放以符政府取締囤積抑平物價之法令云。</p>
<h3>華股徘徊稍軟　晚收時重見回上</h3>
<p>昨華股終日徘徊，上市盤跌，下午稍回上，終比前日尙多軋小，各方人心於恍惚中帶軟，實因投資目標轉移也。百貨業新　公司獨堅，永安等三公司各軋降三五元；紡織股美亞，絲業，永安紗廠等均盤小，亦有背馳向上者，振豐叩升五十元關，榮豐公勝挺秀，景福再見新高價；文化股中影與世界書局均見低一洛；新藥業九福略堅，中法新亞等均疲，化工股保安玻璃軋升，大中華天柴與南洋烟公司均退近七關，公用股呆平，地產　尤軟弱，他如久安等實業，新亞建業等均見低落。康元製罐亦回小</p>
<h3>各公會籌設　調解委員會</h3>
<p>自當局大規模取締囤貨投機以還，各美商人，皆須遵照正規交易，各商人間前所訂立之各項含有投機性之交易，不得不中止，以致糾紛迭起，各業公會方面，爲適應此種環境起見特組織調解委員會，根據當局法令，公平調處同業間種種糾紛，不取任何費用，該委員會之人選，除公會理監事爲當然委員外，並聘仟諳習商事法規之人士充任。今誌晚收表於後。粉麥專委會新規　買</p>

<h3>隊於立公共圖書館之希望</h3>
<p>— 聶士</p>
<p>自二月一日本市一八兩區實施合併以後，一般市民成對市政前途懷抱極大之希望。就大衆化之文化事業而曾，以上海之大，至今尙甚難有一完備之公共圖書館·事變以前·市中心區及南市文廟內均有市立公共圖書館之設立，內容尙能差强人意。事變後，雖有若千私人與團體設立之圖書館如海關·鴻英·靑年會等繼續維特存在·惟或失之過於專門，或門庭若禁，非普通人所可問津，要皆不能符合公共化大衆化之本旨。由是，我人不得不對現處於福州路的區立公共岡書館寄予莫大之期待。</p>
<p>經過一個時期之觀　後，我人感覺區立公共圖書館極待改進者為下列各端：</p>
<p>區立公共圖書館承過去工部局圖書館之傳統，洋化之氣息甚爲濃厚。藏書固以西文爲大宗，即閱覽手續及辦事作風亦頗有外國氣派。對西籍讀者自頗合脾胃，對國人則有格格不入之感矣。我們試舉一端：該館閱覽章程即以英文印製，是以不諳英文之國人讀者之閱覽興趣不得不爲之減低。我人認為租界旣經收回，一八二區又經合併，僅有之區立公共圖書館之經費應不成同題。爲使之中國化。大量中文書籍之添置不容取緩，此後務使外文書籍正數量上成爲次要。在工作上，則應爲中國讀者之便利設想而製定中文章則，借書手續，必要時應派員指導，做到眞正大衆化中國化之地步。</p>
<p>區立公共圖書館流通部分外，尙闢有閱覽室，而此閱覽室實不能令人滿意。以報紙而言，僅備有寥寥數種，且其中大半爲英文及俄文報。以雜誌刋物而言，僅有外界贈送之過時宣傳品數種。閱覽室地位極為寬大，書架　椅設備亦復充分，而內容若是不相稱合，殊令人不解·我人提議閱覽室至少應具備以中文爲主之本地各種報紙雜誌，不論專門者或一般者。並應另行派員管理該室，以維持秩序。我人就記憶所及，事變前南市市允文廟圖書館樓上閱覽室人頭擁擠，爭先閱覽，而秩序井然，有條不紊之情景，與今日廣室獨處之冷洛狀况，對照之下，直天之遠也。</p>
<p>區立公共圖書館處於四樓一隅，殊難令人注目，而閱覽者則頗有登天之感，雖有電梯設備，際此節約電流條件之下，亦限制搭用。以面積而言，該館藏書限度亦屬不大。我人熱切希望市政當局能另覓相當館址，庶幾有發展之餘地。惟現行館址地處中區，頗爲適當，故或可保留而充實之，另在他處別設公共圖書館，以上海一區市區之大，僅一决不足以滿足市民之求智慾。分區多立公共圖書館，亦市政建設之一要端也，　當局深加注意。</p>
<h3>四號學生（四）　海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>他一邊祈禱着天神的護佑，同時對海軍兵學校這樣愼重，發出嘆息之聲。像道樣愼重擇選的學校，在別處恐怕沒有吧？正同傎人家的商店一般。不由地想起了在按置碾米機以前，亡父和母親，從組箥箕轉到油箥箕，每天節米的情形。但是留在最後的箥箕裹的，便是帝國海軍需要的江田島的建男子·想到這裏，眞人的兩片緋紅的頰，越發的泛这血色。</p>
<p>不知不覺地，見到了人家。一個照像館和洗染房林立着而沒有飲食店的街上。眞人的兩足，加上速度了·潛進了低低的校門，到門丁那裏，提出了報到。在那見候着學生的士官，指定了入學前的宿舍。到宿舍一看，是一個普通的大農戶家。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>雖說是大不相同，房屋很寬大，屋裏很整齊，厕所也很淸潔。每年都要被派定做宿舍，所以設備是很完整的。眞人先來了以後，同志們也陸續地到了。定期的小輪船到一次，宿舍裹的靑年們便要增加一批·其中也有被母親和哥哥送着來的。隨着來的人好像是住在另一個宿舍裏。最可喜的是，在最後的一次，軍人班的熊澤也來了。</p>
<p>說起來，都是同志的靑年們，所以他們見面就開始寒暄了，最使眞人吃驚的，就是他自己說的話人家不懂。自己已經决心，今後必須耍使用標準語。但是比他的話還難懂的，就是東北出身的人們。在他們也好像對眞人的括是最難懂似的</p>
<p>無論怎麼說，東京出身者的話，是的都可以通用的。而且東京人的數目數多，要使眞人吃驚的。從來是總以爲東京那柔弱的靑年們是無用的，現在一看——</p>
<p>（全國的秀才薈萃的地方，不努力不行……）又想起了臨行時母親所說的話。</p>
<p>靑年們是不能在宿舍裏閑着無事的。期指導官——敎官頻繁地來往着，提出質問的課　，所以是不能大意的·</p>
<p>一谷眞人……」那個敎官而對着呌他的名字。一回也沒有見過面，怎么會知道自己的名字呢？眞人，很驚奇地。</p>
<p>「是，敎官大人」</p>
<p>「在海軍就是對上官，也不用呌大人！」</p>
<p>眞人第一次伊碰了釘子，瞼也紅了。</p>
<p>「關於志望海軍的動機，說說看！」</p>
<p>對這個　題，將所有的眞情實話都吐出來了</p>
<p>「好了。下回是中村三郞……」敎官將入學預定者的名字，實在知道的很淸楚。這是以後才知道的，因爲敎官將提出的照片和出身校提出的意見書相對照着，在沒見本人以前，對於他的印象已經明了。</p>
<p>二十八日，又有體格檢查。這回是在校內的病室。在這裏要被用×光綫照騐，就要萬事休矣了，可是眞人却安然地通過了。東京出身的中村三郞，被檢查了三天，終吿失敗了。從學校常局領了往復路費，無精打采地出校門去的樣子·實在是不忍卒覩的。就是宜言不合格的軍醫，也不由地將險轉向一旁聲音也擅動着。可是最僥倖的，今年只是中村一個人。　　　社會服務</p>
<h3>不要買了廢票</h3>
<p>前晚邀友人至大舞台看戲，因時値新正，買座極旺，去時較遲，已無佳座。芷在思索之際，忽有人在旁向我兜售票子。彼云：因天雨友人不到，故擬將已購之票出讓，我將戲票取來一看，是第一排中座的三張，覺座位尙佳，就照價付了，另外再添買了一張。後來無意中將票子的正反看了一看，忽見反面有些異樣，再細看時，才發現三張是日塲的戲票，因該戲院的日夜塲戲票形色相同，僅不過在日塲的票背上截了一個日的圖記而已·奉吿買黑市飛票的朋友要當心，不要買了廢票！（沈濬成）</p>

<h3>Cultural Movement and Cultural Figures</h3>
<p>A cultural movement can be said to be the driving force behind all movements, especially in extraordinary times. There is a particular need for a cultural movement to shoulder the task of enlightenment and widespread publicity, so that the people may recognize the face of this extraordinary era. At present, Greater East Asia is in the decisive battle to defeat Britain and the United States, and China is in its second year of participating in the war, a time of cooperative warfare. All military, political, and economic measures require the assistance and advancement of a cultural movement to complete the mission of this extraordinary era.</p>
<p>Those engaged in cultural work are generally referred to as "cultural figures." Naturally, the effectiveness of the cultural movement depends on the actual efforts of these cultural figures. The field of cultural work is extremely broad, so the scope of cultural figures is also very large. Generally speaking, because cultural work is, objectively speaking, inclined towards being non-productive and non-profit-making, the lives of cultural figures are always impoverished and arduous.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the current Nanjing National Government must strive to win the Greater East Asia War on the one hand, and carry out political reform on the other. It truly has a heavy responsibility and a long way to go. Therefore, the need for cultural figures to cooperate is extremely urgent. However, the stagnation and decline of cultural work in the peace zone is an undeniable fact. Tracing the reasons, it is not only the lack of cultural figures, but especially the poor living conditions and environment of cultural figures, making it impossible to improve their work spirit and efficiency, and to make the greatest effort for the cultural movement. Let us try to make an objective analysis. There are several reasons why cultural figures in the current peace zone feel uneasy:</p>
<p>Personal Living Difficulties: Cultural figures generally do not engage in production or are good at making profits. They rely on a pen and a mouth to earn a living. In recent years, prices have risen endlessly, but the income of cultural figures can never keep up with the increase in prices. They cannot shoulder the burden of supporting themselves and their families. As a result, some have become depressed, while others have engaged in other occupations.</p>
<p>Threats and Hostility from the Chongqing and Communist Parties: Special agents from Chongqing and the Communist Party threaten and show hostility towards cultural figures. They carry out various kinds of sabotage on the work undertaken by cultural figures.</p>
<p>Lack of Definite Protection from the National Government: Cultural figures are both threatened and hated by the Chongqing and Communist parties, and the Nanjing National Government does not provide definite protection, causing cultural figures to feel hesitant. On the one hand, they are further oppressed by life, and they become scattered and lonely, which is natural.</p>
<p>Among the past friends of cultural figures, there are not a few Chongqing and Communist party members. Therefore, they may encounter unexpected suspicion. They cannot avoid having many concerns about their own work, and they cannot feel at ease, which affects their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Because of these reasons, there are very few cultural talents in the peace zone. As a result, cultural work is scattered, and cultural standards are low. For example, publications have decreased significantly; readable articles and excellent creations are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns; the atmosphere of academic research is weak, and there are no scientific inventions.</p>
<p>In response to the above reasons, we hope that the government authorities will quickly find ways to improve the situation. At the same time, we hope that the Allied authorities will do their best to assist, so that the cultural movement can cooperate with the war and generate auxiliary power. Here, we offer several expectations:</p>
<p>The government should have a regular subsidy system for the lives of impoverished cultural figures and set up literary awards, academic awards, etc., to encourage research interests and improve cultural standards.</p>
<p>The government should give cultural figures as many publishing opportunities as possible for their writings, encourage creation, and strengthen the people's understanding of this extraordinary era.</p>
<p>The authorities should fully trust and provide definite protection to those cultural figures who work hard in their positions. If they are suspected at every turn and trust is not specialized, no one will be willing to serve, and they will either be perfunctory or feel uneasy in their positions.</p>
<p>If the reasons why cultural figures cannot be stable in the peace zone are not urgently addressed, then there is absolutely no way to talk about a cultural movement; and if political movements are not supported and assisted by a cultural movement, then they will absolutely not be easily successful. The government authorities should attach importance to the importance of the cultural movement, so that cultural figures can serve with peace of mind and fight for common goals!</p>

<h3>General Wu Wenhua's Talk to Reporters</h3>
<p>Beijing, 8th (Central News Agency) - General Wu Wenhua, Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army of the National Government, arrived here on the night of the 6th and met with a group of reporters at 10 a.m. on the 7th to explain the military activities of the army during the year it had participated in the peace camp, and to express his determination at this current stage of the Greater East Asia War. The main points of the conversation are as follows: It has been a year since our army joined the peace camp. During this period, the reason why we were able to achieve the expected goals of maintaining security and construction was due to the unlimited support of the Japanese army and the active cooperation of the awakened people. We are deeply grateful for this. Our army believes that our country is founded on agriculture, so in order to achieve the ideal of integrating soldiers and farmers, we have made our greatest efforts. In order to ensure the peace and prosperity of the people, we have devoted all our efforts to eliminating the Communist army. Now that the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage, the mission undertaken by our participating country is even more important. This year, we will resolutely implement the four major guidelines instructed by Chairman Wang and quickly seek to establish security in North China. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has indicated the path we should take, and the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty makes it impossible for us not to rise up.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Clears Out Remnants of the Chongqing Army in Pingga</h3>
<p>Yangon, 8th (Central News Agency) - After the Chongqing army on the Yunnan-Myanmar border suffered heavy losses in the battle on the Nu River last October, it retreated in defeat. Since January 6, the Japanese army has continued to clear out the remnants of the Chongqing army wandering in the mountains near Pingyou on the Yunnan-Myanmar border.

<h3>Enemy Aircraft Blindly Bomb Japanese Hospital Ship, Large Number of Missionaries Killed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific: The brutality and inhumanity of the American military can be proven by their repeated blind bombing of Japanese hospital ships. Moreover, they also inhumanely bombed the missionaries who were taking refuge under the protection of the Japanese army, further exposing their brutal nature. More than a hundred foreign missionaries living south of New Guinea Island recently suffered heavy losses due to the fierce blind bombing by the U.S. Air Force. Under the protection of the Japanese army, they moved to Mana Island. However, the U.S. Air Force also carried out blind bombing on this island. Therefore, the Japanese army transported these missionaries to蘭迪阿 by barge. On the 6th, the ship was sailing on the sea near Weivajian Island, when at 7:20 a.m. on that morning, 28 U.S. B25 aircraft suddenly flew over the barge and bombed it. The weather was clear that day, and the enemy aircraft flew at ultra-low altitude and repeatedly opened fire. Most of the refugees in the ship were women and children, and most of them were standing on the deck. Moreover, most of the women's clothing was missionary uniforms, but the U.S. Air Force flew from an altitude of 40 to 50 meters and exposed half of their bodies to shoot, thinking that they could recognize that the passengers in the ship were not combatants. Although the Japanese soldiers tried their best to protect the refugees, the enemy aircraft stubbornly opened fire, causing 58 people to be killed on the spot, 80 people to be seriously injured, and almost all others to be injured. The Japanese army immediately sent these injured people to nearby military medical facilities for proper care.</p>

On the night of the 6th, the Japanese navy had the opportunity to discover an enemy transport convoy in the strait between New Britain and New Guinea Island, and bombed it, achieving great results. Furthermore, on 常夜, they attacked the Finschhafen enemy airfield, with all bombs hitting the target, causing fires in both locations. On the other hand, they also urgently attacked the enemy landing positions in the Cape Vogel area of New Britain and the Gros 角 area, launching a fierce attack and destroying them. Regarding the above attacks, except for one Japanese aircraft that did not return, there was no damage to the others.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific, the Japanese army's attack on the enemy troops landing at Gongbi Cape in New Guinea is becoming increasingly fierce. On February 1, the Japanese哨 patrol team once heard the enemy camp on the right bank of the摩特 River, destroying four enemy barracks and killing or injuring all the enemy troops inside.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - A message from a Japanese military base in the Southwest Pacific reported that 14 American aircraft attacked Anben on the night of the 4th. The Japanese garrison forces repelled them with fierce anti-aircraft fire, and the Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Burma Launches Strong Counterattack, Has Occupied Dunbazaa, Anti-Axis Powers Acknowledge Difficulties in Combat</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from the Japanese front in Burma reported that the Japanese army in the India-Burma border area has launched an offensive in the south, attacking the enemy forces in the Mayu Mountain range between the Nyukua River and the Mayu River from three sides. The Japanese army某某 unit launched a fierce attack on the enemy near Nagai after dusk on the 6th. Before long, the enemy forces began to retreat westward. At the same time, the enemy forces 10 kilometers northwest of Buthidaung and on the high ground west of the area also retreated along the highway west of Nagaidekushi. The Japanese army pursued them immediately and achieved great results. The enemy forces in the Mayu River area also began to retreat after dusk on the 6th, and the Japanese army is currently pursuing them. Furthermore, the retreat route of the enemy forces retreating towards Maungdaw has been cut off by the Japanese army, so the enemy forces in that area have become rats in a sack.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - The British Southeast Asia Command announced the following battle situation on the Arakan front on the 7th: The Japanese army on the Arakan front launched a strong counterattack on the 5th. Their surprise attack unit attacked unprepared anti-Axis reconnaissance units. On the 5th, they occupied Dunbazaa. On the evening of the 5th, the two armies fell into chaos. On the 6th, the Japanese army continued to attack southwest of Dunbazaa.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in Burma: The enemy forces on the entire line of the Burma-India border are panicking and losing their way under the cheers of the Indian National Army and the repeated blows of the Japanese army. The swaying of the British, Indian, American, and Chongqing forces has formed extreme unease. In northern Burma, since last year, the New 32nd Division under Zheng Dongguo's部部 of the Chongqing army had been active in the area along the highway from Hpakant to Hpungin, attempting to open the so-called "Road to Tokyo," but they were repeatedly attacked by the Japanese army, suffering heavy losses, abandoning 1,171 bodies, capturing 37 people, and losing 69,928 bullets. Since the beginning of January, the 7th Division and the 某某 Division under the British 14th Army in Maungdaw have also gradually advanced and clamored to retake places like Nikhe, but the Japanese troops suddenly occupied a certain location behind the front line of the 7th Division and launched a fierce advance. Recently, the commander of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, Stilwell, observed the front line and mentioned the difficulties of combat on the northern Burma border. On January 20, the enemy side broadcasted to cover up the famine situation in the state of Bengal and warned that if the Indian National Army reached India, it should immediately report to the British authorities. All of this is nothing more than a flustered expression of the British authorities, and the fact that tens of thousands of elite British troops are on the verge of annihilation in front of Nikhe will only increase the unease of the enemy troops on the front line.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - After the Anti-Axis powers' meeting in Quebec, the Southeast Asia Military Command was set up and狂狂 brayed to retake Burma, but more than three months have passed since the rainy season ended, and a large-scale action has not yet begun. Today, the Japanese army suddenly launched an offensive to制制 the enemy. Due to the clear indications of various facts, the Southeast Asia Military authorities also admitted that the counter-offensive operation in Burma cannot proceed according to the scheduled plan. Recently, according to the Daily Mail, the New Delhi authorities also admitted that the formal attack war in Burma would still take a considerable period of time, but the rainy season would arrive soon, so the recent local fighting could be carried out in the near-land area of the Thai晋 front. Furthermore, the British "One Week in the East" magazine discussed the delay in the counter-offensive operation in Burma on the 7th, saying that the people of the Anti-Axis countries must wait patiently for the launch of the counter-offensive operation in Burma. Without more equipment and军军 troops than at present, it is not possible to break through the Burma front on a large scale. Although there is sufficient manpower necessary for land battles, there is no space to use these troops. In the future, the Indian army must find ways to establish contact with the Chongqing army. Mountbatten must overcome the adverse geographical conditions. If large-scale naval power cannot be used in the Bay of Bengal, the activities of the British army on land will still be restricted.</p>
<h3>The Importance of the Battle of Mayu Mountain: Remarks by Japanese Military Expert</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a military expert here, the significance of the ongoing operation on the Burmese-Indian border is as follows: The Japanese army on the Burmese-Indian border unexpectedly launched an offensive from the front of Buthidaung on the 4th of this month.  It is continuing its advance in the Mayu mountain range, which is densely forested, canyoned, and towering at an altitude of 10,000 feet, and is steadily reaping the expected war results. At the same time, the Free Indian National Army is also cooperating with the Japanese army to overcome all obstacles and advance towards Delhi. From a broad perspective, this war has a turning point importance in the current stage of the Greater East Asia War.  The significance is briefly described as follows: This operation was initiated by the Japanese army, so the command of the battle is in the hands of the Japanese army. This proves that even though the Japanese army is currently engaged in fierce battles with the US army in the Pacific, which are rare in war history, it still has the ability to launch offensives anytime and anywhere when necessary. British cunning is even worse than that of the United States. They planned to make Japan and the United States fight each other in the Pacific first, and then launch an offensive in Southeast Asia when the Atlantic war situation developed favorably. Judging from the recent Pacific war situation, Mountbatten believed that the time for the British and American forces to act had arrived, and he was preparing activities on the Burmese-Indian border, attempting to form a general counter-offensive against Japan with British and American pincer attacks. However, his attempt has suffered a major setback because the Japanese army launched a preemptive general offensive. The main goal of Mountbatten's counter-offensive was to recapture or destroy the southern resource areas where the Japanese army cultivated its combat power, but the rapid progress of the Japanese army's current operation has shattered the enemy's ambition and made the southern resource sphere more consolidated. A major reason for the enemy's attempt to counter-attack Burma was to open up the road from northern Burma to Chongqing, but after the Japanese army started a new operation, this attempt was again thwarted. The United States has the highest expectations for opening up the Burma-Chongqing road, and the United States hopes to use this route to enhance its aid to Chongqing, increase its strength in building a second front in China, and actively expand the US air force stationed in Chongqing, in an attempt to realize its ambition to carry out air raids on the Japanese mainland, so as to contain the Japanese army's Pacific front. Therefore, the United States has equipped the three divisions of troops stationed in India and Chongqing with American-style equipment and American instructors. Recently, it has even planned to統轄 Yunnan-Chongqing army. It is rumored that the United States and Chongqing are currently negotiating the transfer of command of the Chongqing army in that province. The United States' intention was originally to sacrifice the Chongqing army in order to open up the Burma-Chongqing road. Chongqing also believes that the only way to break out of the current predicament is to realize the northern Burma road, so as to obtain supplies from Britain and the United States. Therefore, without thinking carefully, it is willing to listen to the opinions of the United States, and intends to order the Chongqing army in Yunnan Province to launch a counter-offensive when the British and Indian armies counter-attack Burma, so as to cooperate with the US army. Since the new spring of this year, the Chongqing army in Yunnan Province and the Chongqing army stationed in India in the Hukawng Valley area have been coordinating with each other, attempting to launch a general counter-offensive. However, the Japanese army's attack on the Chongqing army in the southern border of Burma and India has revealed flaws in this attempt. The Japanese army's meticulous defense has left the Chongqing army with no room for stupidity. As a result, the United States' plan to open up the road from northern Burma to Chongqing to relieve Chongqing's plight and strengthen China's second front has become a pipe dream. In this operation, the Free Indian National Army and the Burmese National Army cooperated with the Japanese army and fought side by side, launching a joint attack, which is worthy of long-term attention. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo said in his policy speech on January 21 that Chandra Bose raised the flag of independence in a corner of India and rose up for the freedom of India. The Japanese government has decided to do its best to actively provide assistance in the future. This is Japan's strong declaration of its determination to assist in the liberation of India. Now, with the support of the Japanese army, the Indian National Army has begun a general offensive towards Delhi to realize its long-cherished wish to liberate its motherland. In addition, the Japanese army is also providing full cooperation to the national army of the new Burma in order to liberate East Asia from the shackles of Britain and the United States. At present, the Japanese, Burmese, and Indian armies are united into a system and are currently tightening the encirclement of the Mountbatten army. Therefore, the war in the Mayu mountain range is of great importance.</p>
<h3>Indian National Army Stationed in the Arakan Mountains; Basic Principles of Army Building Announced</h3>
<p>Burma, 8th (Central News Agency) – After the Indian National Army moved to Burma on January 7, it waited for an opportunity to advance towards its motherland. Now that the time it has longed for has arrived, it has resolutely cooperated with the Japanese army to start a war for freedom. Therefore, the liberation of India has begun its initial stage. Now, the basic principles of the Indian National Army's army building are introduced as follows: The Indian National Army is an army of Indians themselves. The National Army belongs to the Indian Provisional Government, swears allegiance to the motherland, takes unity and trust as its creed, gathers all its strength to achieve the goal of overthrowing Britain, and carries out the independence of the motherland. Based on the elite soldier principle, only the best are organized. The commander-in-chief of the Indian National Army is Bose, and his staff is 列斯列. The total number of soldiers is unknown, but religious opposition and ethnic discrimination are not abandoned, and the goal of liberating the motherland is achieved together. Even the women's unit commanded by Minister Lakshmi Bai participates in the battle line. Indians throughout East Asia have now risen up, with the National Army as the core, and stationed in the Arakan Mountains. The future activities of the Indian people are highly anticipated.</p>
<h3>Air Raid on the Northern Suburbs of Bangkok</h3>

<h3>The Battle for the Fortress of Europe: Asahi Shimbun Roundtable Discussion</h3>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun believes that if Britain and the United States truly regard this year as the decisive year, they must open up a second front that echoes the Eastern Front. In the joint statement issued by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union at the Tehran Conference at the end of November last year, "Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union were in complete agreement on the scale and timing of the simultaneous attacks on Germany from the east, west, and south." Therefore, the "attack from the west" that has not yet been implemented is about to take place. The question is, when and where will Britain and the United States start? This is the climax of the tense European war situation. What are the observations in various places regarding the timing and location of the second front, which Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are keeping extremely secret?</p>
<p>Special Correspondent in Moscow – Soviet newspapers and the Soviet people are urging Britain and the United States to open up a second front as soon as possible. However, the leadership of the second front lies with Britain and the United States, so Soviet newspapers and the people try to avoid making various predictions about the second front. Therefore, it is very difficult to predict the timing and location of the second front. However, it seems that people generally believe that when Britain and the United States invade Western Europe, the British and American forces will land simultaneously on the Atlantic coast of France, Belgium, Norway, etc. As for the timing, they will seize the opportunity to exert the greatest effect and implement organized coordinated operations.</p>
<p>Special Correspondent Taguchi (Zurich) – The timing of the anti-Axis forces' offensive in Europe will be after the anti-Axis forces have actively bombed the German transportation network, and will gradually be realized starting in mid-February. However, the key lies in two factors: the movement of the Eastern Front and the effect of the air strikes. For example, regarding the first factor, the Eastern Front, if a decisive change very favorable to the Red Army is seen, the offensive will also be rapidly promoted. The main battleground of the offensive is the western coast of Europe and the Balkans. Landings in southern France and Norway are likely to be of a diversionary nature.</p>
<p>Special Correspondent Watanabe (Stockholm) – Churchill and Roosevelt promised Stalin to open a second front at the Tehran Conference, but their words often don't count. British and American propaganda claims that there are now two million troops in the UK preparing to invade Western Europe. Newspapers say that the British army has fifty divisions in the UK, the American army has fifty to one hundred divisions, there are twenty to thirty British divisions in North Africa, ten divisions of the Tagore army, and thirty British divisions in Syria. The British and American forces' invasion of Western Europe has been prepared so that it can be started anytime and anywhere, and now they are just waiting for the opportunity to start.</p>
<p>There are various speculations about the location of the offensive. First, small-scale landings will be carried out simultaneously in various places in a diversionary sense. The question lies in where the main force of the invading army is. In northern Italy, there is the natural barrier of the Alps, and on the French Mediterranean coast, there is also the constraint of the Nonu River Valley between the Alps and the Central Mountains. As for using Norway as the main battlefield, it is too far away.</p>
<p>On the other hand, regarding the geographical conditions of the Balkans, it has been repeatedly rumored that the游擊隊 forces of 　特 and Mihailović, which cannot threaten the German domestic front, will be used to attack the Balkans. However, the游擊戰 currently being carried out in the Balkans cannot be regarded as a true military operation. The future Balkan operations will also become a "snail's pace" like the Italian operations. Therefore, the most likely offensive location currently considered is the English Channel area from the Netherlands, Belgium to northern France. (To be continued) (Note: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, February 21)</p>
<h3>Focus of Eastern Front Shifts to Nikopol; Fierce Battles Continue in Vitebsk</h3>
<p>Berlin, entered on the same day (Central News Agency) – Since January, the focus of the war on the Eastern Front has shifted to the 洞爾赫夫 in Leningrad. The Soviet army's northern offensives, which started from that area, temporarily stopped on the Baltic border. Since the beginning of February, the focus has shifted again to the Nikopol bridgehead area in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. Last October, due to the Soviet army's Dnieper River breakthrough operation in the Kryvyi Rih area, the German army abandoned the right bank of the middle reaches of the river and switched to defending the iron ore producing area of Kryvyi Rih and the manganese ore producing area of Nikopol. This time, the Soviet army encircled the Dnieper bend from three directions: the southern bank of the Dnieper River from the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporozhye areas. The German authorities also acknowledged the gravity of the war situation and declared that they would defend the city of Nikopol to the death. The fate of the Dnieper bend depends entirely on whether the German army can hold Nikopol, so this war situation is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to the Haitsu News Agency: The Soviet army launched another fierce attack on Vitebsk yesterday, only achieving a local breakthrough, but suffering heavy casualties. In the evening, they launched another attack, but were still repelled. North of Nevel, the enemy attempted to expand the line they had broken through, but ultimately failed. Near the Narva isthmus and around Kryvyi Rih, the Soviet army launched small-scale offensives without success. The German army continued to advance south of the isthmus. The war situation in the northern sector of the Eastern Front has generally not changed. Soviet power has increased in the areas south of Pripyat and Nikopol. Yesterday, Soviet rapid units and cavalry advanced westward on the plains north of Kryvyi Rih, but were blocked by the German army, and fierce battles continued. The weather in the southern sector of the Eastern Front is warm, with temperatures around 0 to 16 degrees Celsius, and it rains frequently, so the ground is very muddy, making combat very difficult. The entire Dnieper bend is like a large quagmire.</p>
<h3>British and American Forces South of Rome Switch to Defensive; German Army Deploys Arc-Shaped Encirclement</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) – The anti-Axis forces that landed in Nettuno, southern Italy, attempted to attack Rome, but suffered heavy setbacks due to the fierce attack of the German elite under Marshal Kesselring, and switched from offensive to defensive, attempting to maintain their acquired positions. The German army has now cut off the highway from Anzio to Albano with tank units in order to annihilate the British army protruding into Aprilia, and the anti-Axis forces' front line has fallen into chaos. The German army in that area is not only ensuring contact with Rome, but also continuously assembling elite troops to strengthen Ardea, Aprilia, Cisterna, and other places, forming an arc-shaped encirclement line around the Nettuno bridgehead. It is rumored that an elite German division has arrived in that area, and it is expected that Marshal Kesselring will launch a large-scale counter-offensive with mechanized units.</p>
<p>Fierce Battles Continue on Cassino Line</p>
<p>Also, on the Cassino front, the two armies are still continuing fierce battles around the city, and the German army has completely taken control of the city.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – The German Führer's headquarters announced: The American army northwest of Cassino launched an attack with a large force throughout the day. The German army engaged them in a charge battle, inflicting heavy damage on them and repelling them.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Continuously Exert Pressure on Neutral Countries; Attempt to Interfere in Spanish Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency learned last night: The London "Observer" launched another fierce attack on Spain, demanding not only international political guarantees from Spain, but also the reorganization of Spanish internal institutions. Commenting on this offensive, Berlin political circles regarded it as extremely serious, because the demands were made as an official announcement to Spain and contained the meaning of a reply to the Spanish government. The "Observer" has always been known for its moderate arguments, and its political articles have a great influence on the British Foreign Office. This attack has completely clarified the situation and revealed the cards being played by the British ambassador to Spain, Hall. This article proves that Britain and the United States' attacks on Spanish neutrality are just an excuse for Britain and the United States to interfere in Spanish internal affairs.</p>
<p>Angland, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Nalote newspaper commented on the British and American attacks on the neutral countries, saying that the pressure they have recently exerted on the neutral countries is only to implement the decisions of the Tehran Conference. Turkey was the first neutral country to be attacked, and Spain is its successor, but neither Turkey nor Spain will make concessions that are detrimental to the interests of the anti-Axis countries.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Prepare for Psychological Warfare Against the Axis Powers</h3>
<p>Geneva, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency, Washington news: US War Information Bureau Director台雜斯 declared: The Bureau has sent歇　伍特 to London to make various arrangements for launching "psychological warfare" against the Axis powers. He also announced the resignation of three officials of the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Turkish Parliamentarians Warn Britain and the Soviet Union Not to Interfere in Balkan Affairs</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 8th (Central News Agency) – Turkish parliamentarian亞爾頓, known for his pro-anti-Axis stance, wrote a warning to Britain and the Soviet Union, saying that they should no longer regard the Balkan countries as their spheres of influence and listen to the Balkan peoples to assert themselves. He also said that the anti-Axis countries should stop their cunning schemes of driving A to fight B.</p>
<h3>Finnish Capital Suffers Second Air Raid</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) – After the Soviet Air Force bombed Helsinki on the evening of the 6th, it launched a second bombing of the city between midnight and 3:30 AM on the 7th.</p>
<h3>The Current Stage of Urban Air Defense – On the Issue of Urban Evacuation</h3>
<p>Understanding Air Gaps</p>
<p>The air battle in the Southwest Pacific is becoming increasingly fierce. Not only in the Southwest Pacific, but also on the Chinese mainland and the northern front lines, the Japanese army is stepping up its defense against enemy aircraft attacks. Their brave and determined combat is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Fortunately, enemy aircraft have not yet invaded the Japanese mainland. The special circumstances of the American mainland are not discussed here. Among the major countries at war, Japan is the only country whose cities have not been bombed. However, is the Japanese territory really within the bombing safe zone? Enemy aircraft can fly from bases in mainland China and the northern Aleutians, or from aircraft carriers. Indeed, the Japanese mainland is in a dangerous state.</p>
<p>The air battle is not only unfolding in areas far from the mainland. The Japanese mainland will also become a fierce battlefield. We must be aware of what may happen at any time. The history of air defense has been more than ten years. It is well known that there has been great progress in air defense activities and facilities compared to ten years ago.</p>
<p>However, urban air defense remains the same, which is regrettable. Looking at the current stage of the war situation, one cannot help but shudder. Can we arrange the order of priority for air defense preparation based on the importance of urban conditions and facilities? Needless to say, we cannot limit air defense preparation work due to limited resources and limited budgets.</p>
<p>Air Defense Preparation and Assessment of Air Raids</p>
<p>To implement air defense preparation, the most important thing is to assess air raids. The assessment of air raids should be entrusted to experts. Ordinary people cannot make arbitrary judgments. However, we should take the opinions of ordinary people so as not to have unexpected results. This is especially important to pay attention to. At this current stage when air raids are bound to come, the four areas of Keihin, Hanshin, Chukyo, and North Kyushu need no discussion. The remaining key areas of the country should be aware that they cannot avoid repeated bombing by a considerable number of enemy aircraft. As the American counter-offensive intensifies, it is natural that they are no longer satisfied with the kind of surprise attack like the April 18th raid. This is quite obvious. Therefore, we should take the most comprehensive measures in advance for the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation of urban air defense in famous European countries, such as Hamburg, Berlin, Milan, etc., and the bombing by the US and British air forces, or the air battles in the Solomon Islands in the South, future air raids will be carried out by aircraft groups of hundreds or two to three hundred aircraft. As for sea-based bombing by several or a dozen aircraft, it will no longer be considered an air raid. No, an air raid that does not achieve a considerable purpose cannot be called an air raid. Air raids and air defense are relative, so as air defense facilities become more and more prepared, air raids gradually become larger and more intense. However, even cities that have been declared undefended, such as Paris and Rome, cannot avoid air raids.</p>
<p>On Urban Evacuation</p>
<p>The main issue at the current stage of urban air defense is the issue of urban evacuation. Japan's biggest shortcoming in air defense is the formation of large, dense urban areas, and the concentration of various national institutions.</p>
<p>Urban areas, especially densely populated urban areas, must be evacuated. This is a fundamental issue. In particular, Tokyo should quickly disperse various overlapping functions, such as political, economic, cultural, and production institutions, and simplify their functions. This is an indispensable measure. Is it not because of the need to increase production, strengthen economic control, and the lack of materials and labor that the issue of urban evacuation has not been raised? Originally, air defense is passive and non-productive, but in order to protect the country, it is essential to strengthen urban air defense actively.</p>
<p>The issue of urban evacuation can not only be effective in air defense, but can also alleviate the disasters of large cities that have been talked about for many years. As for the non-productive problems that may arise temporarily due to the evacuation of large cities, they can be compensated from other aspects or at another time.</p>
<p>The scope of the issue of urban evacuation is extremely broad. It is also closely related to the issue of population evacuation. Here, we only talk about the evacuation of facilities and the decentralization of functions. If there is no facility evacuation, even population evacuation is just a plan on paper.</p>
<p>The so-called evacuation is to disperse the originally dense urban areas or the functions concentrated in the city, transform them into urban areas with many open spaces, or reduce the burden on the city. Therefore, the content of the issue involving urban institutions includes: 1. Moving homes or factories in densely populated urban areas to other places, transforming them into urban areas with more open spaces and sparse buildings. 2. Moving factories, schools, government offices, etc. to local areas, simplifying urban functions and reducing the burden on the city itself.</p>
<p>From the current situation in Japan, the evacuation of densely populated urban areas must be carried out comprehensively. We cannot say which area is better. We must start with areas where the air raid risk is relatively low, or where some damage is unavoidable, in order. From the perspective of the entire country, the cities in the so-called four major industrial areas, such as Keihin and Hanshin, should be the first to start. Above all, the industrial areas within the cities, including important factories, must be the first to start.</p>
<p>While rapidly preparing air defense, we must not only not relax the production of important wartime materials, but also use all means to protect them, so as to avoid air raids. Therefore, evacuating and reorganizing the densely populated areas around military factories is an urgent task. At the same time, we should think about exchanging housing, etc. In the event of an air raid, traffic will stop and factory production will inevitably be suspended, so preparations must be made. Some people say that if the surroundings of important factories are evacuated, they will be easily recognized as the targets of bombing. We should plan camouflage or other methods to protect them. Considering fire prevention, bulletproof and other issues, there is nothing better than building open spaces.</p>
<p>We will encounter a lack of materials and housing when demolishing houses or relocating. Although it seems to be a contradictory method, at this current stage when air raids are bound to come, it is better to relocate before the event occurs, which is a wiser strategy. As for the housing problem, if we consider the decentralization of urban functions, the reorganization of small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises, or the conversion of the uses of large residences and restaurants, then it should be largely resolved.

In addition, police stations and Baojia organizations are scheduled to inspect light control facilities in various locations. It is hoped that each household will be able to utilize suitable old materials to vigorously prepare light control materials. On this day, a hypothetical training alert will be issued, and police stations or Baojia district instructors will direct pedestrians to seek refuge, regardless of age or gender. If simulated enemy bombs are dropped, pedestrians on the road should either lie down to avoid danger or cooperate with air defense personnel to fight fires. The headquarters is currently planning these measures, and it is hoped that all citizens will work hard together to ensure the success of the air defense efforts.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Alarm</p>
<p>Furthermore, a notification states: Today (9th), this city will hold the second Air Defense Day, and all Baojia districts have been ordered to prepare. It is reported that the scope of this exercise will be expanded. Citizens on the road must participate when they encounter the exercise.

<h3>Textbooks are Hoarded and Not Sold, Students Have Difficulty Purchasing Books</h3>
<p>The various primary and secondary schools in this city have started one after another in recent days. According to a person in the education sector, students in various primary and secondary schools this semester are feeling extremely difficult to purchase textbooks. The reason is that various sales bookstores are unwilling to sell them. At present, the textbooks used in various primary and secondary schools are all those approved by the Ministry of Education. The selling prices of these books have also been strictly stipulated. All bookstores must sell them at the limited price and must not violate it. However, most bookstores are now hoarding large quantities of books for speculative purposes, which is no different from manipulating other commodities, and selling them privately at high black market prices, which directly affects education, which is very hateful. It is now learned that the education authorities in charge have begun to pay attention to this matter, and once the investigation is true, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>The Guangong Institute Handles Student Aid Funds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Guangdong Public Institute has been running schools for many years, creating many talents. In addition to increasing subsidies for Guangzhao Public School and Guangdong Women's School this spring, it has also expanded the number of Guangbei Righteous School students by more than 200 (those who are interested in applying must immediately register at the school at Lane 478, Shunheli, Datong Road, to take the entrance examination and enter the school for free). Recently, it has also been negotiating to recover its own houses for its own use, and before greatly expanding the school buildings, it specially allocated 20,500 yuan to entrust this newspaper to handle student aid funds for agriculture and engineering. It is learned that the institute, starting from this academic year, has many poor children from Guangdong who need assistance, and specially transferred more than 200,000 yuan to subsidize the Guangdong out-of-school youth who were unable to get help, referring to this newspaper's student aid fund method. As of the 4th of this month, a total of 85 qualified middle school students and 237 elementary school students have been selected, and the full amount of student aid funds has been sent to the schools where each student is studying. Students who have been selected should complete the enrollment procedures as soon as they receive the notice. If the deadline is exceeded, it will be considered as a waiver. The office of the Guangbi Public Institute is at No. 36, Jiangxi Road, 5th Floor, Shanghai Bank Building. If there are any errors in the mail, students who have applied for student aid funds should go to the Public Institute to see the list of topics selected for the eight selections. , you can understand. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Public Institute said to the reporter: Before the Public Institute recovers its own houses, it also intends to solicit suitable houses, so that it can make further expansions to the student aid righteous cause. The philanthropists and benefactors in Shanghai who are enthusiastic about education are so enthusiastic about donating money to be used as loan scholarships. Those who have land property and have thousands of buildings, it is no different from a drop in the bucket to waive the rent. If there is anyone willing to use a fair rent to be a palace, it will surely be twice the result with half the effort. This is also another way to promote loan scholarships. It's not a good idea for educators to think about the problem of finding a school building for the current school.</p>
<h3>Luo and Lu's Engagement Ceremony</h3>
<p>Luo Guang, manager of the Central Tax School Management Office, is the younger brother of Mr. Luo Junqiang. Yesterday, at noon, he held an engagement ceremony with Miss Jing, the daughter of Lu Yifeng, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, at the International Hotel. About 300 guests came, including Yuan Shu and Xu Pu, which was very grand at the time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Welfare Association Asks to Increase Righteous Schools</h3>
<p>In recent years, the cost of living has increased, and the burden on citizens has become heavier. The number of out-of-school children in the Nanshi District has increased sharply. The Shanghai Southern Municipal Welfare Association has specially submitted a document to the Municipal Education Bureau requesting an increase in the number of compulsory schools and adding free places for poor children in various schools, so that poor children will not be out of school.</p>
<h3>Person in Charge of Commercial Integration Explains the Cotton Cloth Allocation Problem: Temporary Allocation is Rushing to Formulate Detailed Methods</h3>
<p>Regarding the temporary allocation of cotton cloth, rumors have been circulating for a long time. Recently, there have been rumors that uninspected bulk cloth is designated for allocation purposes, and the allocation price obtained is collected by the owner of the goods. In order to understand the actual situation, the reporter made a special trip to visit the person in charge of the National Commercial Control Association and asked about everything. The following is a record of the questions and answers:</p>
<p>Q: I heard that your association has taken temporary allocation measures because people have not been able to buy cloth for a long time after the yarn and cloth were purchased. What is the actual situation?</p>
<p>A: The purchase of yarn and cloth is entrusted to our association by the government, and all methods are stipulated by the government. Therefore, a separate office is set up to handle it in order to clarify the authority. Now the purchase work has been completed, and the allocation should be implemented immediately, but because the centralized allocation plan is still waiting for various parties to report data, comprehensively study and formulate a basic plan, and submit it to the government for approval before it can be implemented. In order to take care of the suffering of merchants and the people, our association has obtained the government's approval for a special temporary allocation method. The principle has been approved by the government, and we are rushing to formulate detailed methods day and night, and are discussing back and forth with relevant agencies. It will be announced and implemented soon.</p>
<p>Q: I heard that uninspected bulk cloth is designated for allocation purposes, and the allocation price obtained is collected by the owner of the goods. Is this method equivalent to not buying it?</p>
<p>A: Our association purchases yarn and cloth on behalf of the government in accordance with the relevant regulations and rules promulgated by the government. This method is inconsistent with the regulations and rules, and our association is not convenient to advocate it. However, since our association is a commercial group, we are happy to do everything we can to ask the government for orders on behalf of merchants. Now that we hear that merchants are directly requesting the government, our association can only wait for the government's orders to handle it and is not convenient to express any opinions.</p>
<p>Q: Since the cloth is allocated, what about the yarn? The allocation of guest yarn is related to the new production process. As for the new production process, how should the processing notes be stipulated? Tai will have already notified the yarn and cloth industry associations to study it as soon as possible so that they can formulate a plan based on it and submit it to the government for approval. Because if the actual situation of the industry is not taken into account, and it is rashly formulated, once it is approved and announced, there will be many obstacles to implementation, and changes will be even more troublesome. Therefore, we sincerely hope that all interested parties will make suggestions as soon as possible and express their opinions as much as possible to avoid delays and self-inflicted mistakes, and there will be no regrets.</p>
<p>Q: I heard that the cloth allocated temporarily this time will follow the example of Nanjing City and only allow each household to purchase 1.5 feet. Is this true?</p>
<p>A: The idea of 1.5 feet per household has indeed been proposed, but the original plan submitted by our association to the government was 1.5 feet per person, and we have not received any other orders to change it.</p>
<p>Finally, the person in charge of the association said: "Recently, there have often been random remarks without asking the reason. I don't know that our association is a commercial collective that handles autonomous control. Since it is a collective organization of merchants, all issues related to the industry can be formally inquired by the industry associations of each industry to our association. The industry associations also often work hard for the happiness of the industry, take responsibility, and solve pain in the spirit of autonomous control. If you send a letter to the association to inquire, our association will answer in detail. If you do not follow this process and cause disturbances outside, it will still not help your own problems. This is what our association regrets very much."</p>

<h3>Jishan Cup Small Football: Supplementary Submission of Photos</h3>

According to the Cup, ten strong teams joining Group A, almost half of the players belong to the Shanghai Football Association. Therefore, the Jishan Cup authorities, in order to take care of the Kuailian Association's notice, urged the top ten teams of Jia New to change their list and submit supplementary photos within five days.

<h3>Commentary: The Way Out for National Capital</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun published an editorial on the 7th titled "The Way Out for Chinese National Capital," pointing out the reasons for the speculative nature of Chinese national capital. It stated that Chinese national capital cannot develop from a primitive savings system but starts with high-interest loan capital like Piaohao (traditional Chinese banks) and Qianzhuang (money shops) and exchange capital. This prevents national capital from transforming into industrial capital, and bank capital cannot control the industrial sector, resulting in speculative capital that hinders all construction. Therefore, a suitable way out should be sought, which means eliminating all difficulties and cultivating healthy national industries. The main idea of the original article is as such, which can be said to be very pertinent.</p>
<p>Taking Shanghai, a place where a huge amount of national capital is concentrated, as an example, because capital has no outlet and cannot be transformed into industrial capital, it forms two of the most serious economic pathologies: one is the rampant speculation, and the other is the unlimited rise in prices. Regarding the former, for example, "Now all citizens of Shanghai, even salaried workers, teachers, shop assistants, maids, and laborers, are frantically engaged in bullish and bearish stock market activities." Regarding the latter, for example, "Towels that were sold for 22 yuan each two weeks ago now cost 65 yuan, and socks that were sold for 30 yuan a pair now cost more than 70 yuan." If this continues, Shanghai's economic condition is like that of a patient nearing death, because who in the world relies solely on gambling for a living? And who can withstand such a raging storm in their lives?</p>
<p>We said a year ago that the future of Shanghai's economy, whether for good or ill, is created by Shanghai's financiers and entrepreneurs themselves, and the responsibility for nurturing, protecting, developing, and growing it lies with the government. This statement seems ambiguous on the surface, but it is actually aimed at the problem of the way out for Chinese national capital. Because after the promulgation of the wartime economic policy guidelines, didn't we say that our financiers and entrepreneurs should work together to increase industrial production, to realize the planned production of the whole country, everyone should eliminate private interests, look far ahead, and earnestly recognize the important economic mission that they should bear at present?</p>
<h3>Price Limits for Most Goods Determined by Various Industries to Enforce Strictly; Prices Must Be Clearly Marked for Retail Sales</h3>
<p>The various industry associations in this city previously formed an "Appraisal Committee for Goods" and formulated regulations, notifying all members to follow them. According to a reporter's investigation yesterday, the appraisal committees of the various industries, in view of the recent sharp rise in prices and the people's unrest, felt that it was their responsibility and could not bear to sit idly by. Therefore, they have been holding meetings in recent days to review whether the price limits of goods that have been evaluated in the past are in line with standardization. After discussion, it was decided that most price limits would remain unchanged, without any relaxation. All businesses in the same industry must mark the prices clearly at the prominent places when selling any goods in the stores, so that every customer can easily see and clearly distinguish them. However, for a few categories, due to cost reasons, they will be submitted to the authorities for changes.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops Are Particularly Cautious in Lending</h3>
<p>After the New Year holidays, all banks and money shops in this city have reopened for business. Due to the tight money supply and the fact that most of the indebted customers of the banks and money shops failed to settle their debts on time at the end of last year, the banks and money shops are particularly cautious in handling loan business since the beginning of this year. Some of the indebted customers who failed to settle their debts last year have been temporarily suspended from sending deposit books, and old accounts are being urged to be settled, resulting in no relaxation of the money supply after the New Year. It is reported that in order to regulate finance and support the development of legitimate industrial and commercial businesses, the banks and money shops, while urging the repayment of old debts, have resumed lending to customers who have already settled their accounts. However, in order to prevent industrial and commercial businesses from using funds for speculation and hoarding, they must carefully consider those who apply for loans, and refuse to lend to those who are not engaged in legitimate business or production, in order to comply with the government's laws and regulations to crack down on hoarding and suppress prices.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Hovered Slightly Lower, Rebounding at the Evening Close</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks hovered throughout yesterday, with the market falling. It rebounded slightly in the afternoon, but still closed lower than the previous day. People's hearts were soft and in a daze, because the investment target has shifted. The new department store company was particularly strong, while Wing On and other three companies fell by three to five yuan each; textile stocks, such as Meiya, silk, and Wing On Yarn Factory, were small, and some went against the trend and rose. Zhenfeng hit the 50 yuan mark, Rongfeng and Gong Sheng were outstanding, and Jingfu saw a new high price again; among cultural stocks, China Film and World Book Company both saw a low of one Luo (a unit of currency); among new pharmaceutical companies, Jiufu was slightly firm, while Sino-French and New Asia were weak; among chemical stocks, Baoan Glass rose, while Greater China, Tian Chai, and Nanyang Tobacco Company all fell close to the seven mark; utility stocks were flat, and real estate was particularly weak. Other industries, such as Jiu'an and other industrial companies, and New Asia Construction and other companies, all saw declines. Kangyuan Canning also rebounded slightly.</p>
<h3>Various Associations Planning to Establish Mediation Committees</h3>
<p>Since the authorities launched a large-scale crackdown on hoarding and speculation, all merchants must abide by regular transactions. All transactions with speculative elements that were previously concluded between merchants had to be terminated, resulting in frequent disputes. In order to adapt to this situation, the various industry associations organized mediation committees to fairly mediate various disputes between colleagues based on the laws and regulations of the authorities, without charging any fees. In addition to the directors and supervisors of the association serving as ex-officio members of the committee, people who are familiar with commercial laws and regulations are also hired to serve as members. The evening closing table is now recorded below. New rules for the Flour and Wheat Special Committee Buy</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Special Committee New Rules Acquisition</h3>
<p>The new purchasing work of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee has been preparing since the end of last year, and has recently raised several billion yuan. This purchasing work adopts a different style. Approximately ten units among the 53 commissioned merchants are responsible for purchasing matters. The purchasing areas are the Wuhu area in northern Jiangsu.</p>

<h3>Hopes for the Establishment of Public Libraries</h3>
<p>— Nie Shi</p>
<p>Since the merger of the city's 18th and 2nd districts on February 1st, the general public has great hopes for the future of the municipality. Regarding popular cultural undertakings, it is still very difficult to have a complete public library in a city as big as Shanghai. Before the Incident, there were municipal public libraries in the city center and in the Wenmiao (Temple of Confucius) in the Nanshi (South City) area, and their contents were still somewhat satisfactory. After the Incident, although some libraries established by private individuals and organizations, such as the Customs, Hongying, and YMCA, continued to exist, they were either too specialized or restricted access, making them inaccessible to ordinary people. None of them can meet the purpose of being public and popular. Therefore, we have to place great expectations on the district public libraries currently located on Fuzhou Road.</p>
<p>After a period of observation, we feel that the district public libraries need to be improved in the following aspects:</p>
<p>The district public libraries inherited the tradition of the former Shanghai Municipal Council Library, and have a strong foreign influence. The collection is mainly in Western languages, and even the reading procedures and work style are quite foreign. It is quite suitable for Western readers, but it feels incompatible with Chinese people. Let's take one example: the library's reading regulations are printed in English, which inevitably reduces the reading interest of Chinese readers who do not understand English. We believe that since the concessions have been taken back and the first and second districts have been merged, the funding for the only district public library should not be a problem. In order to make it Chinese, the addition of a large number of Chinese books should not be delayed. In the future, the number of foreign books should be secondary. In terms of work, Chinese rules should be formulated for the convenience of Chinese readers, and borrowing procedures should be followed. When necessary, staff should be sent to guide readers, so as to achieve true popularity and localization.</p>
<p>In addition to the circulation section, the district public library also has a reading room, but this reading room is not satisfactory. As far as newspapers are concerned, there are only a few types, and most of them are English and Russian newspapers. As far as magazines and periodicals are concerned, there are only a few outdated publicity materials donated by the outside world. The reading room is very spacious, and the equipment of bookshelves and chairs is also sufficient, but the content is so mismatched, which is quite puzzling. We propose that the reading room should at least have various local newspapers and magazines, mainly in Chinese, whether specialized or general. Staff should also be assigned to manage the room to maintain order. As far as we can remember, before the Incident, the reading room upstairs in the Nanshi Municipal Wenmiao Library was crowded, with people rushing to read, but the order was orderly and methodical. Compared with the cold and desolate situation of today's empty room, it is as far as the sky.</p>
<p>The district public library is located in a corner on the fourth floor, which is difficult to attract attention, and readers feel like they are climbing to the sky. Although there is elevator equipment, it is restricted from use under the current conditions of saving electricity. In terms of area, the library's book collection limit is also not large. We earnestly hope that the municipal authorities can find another suitable location for the library, so that there will be room for development. However, the current library location is in the central area, which is quite appropriate, so it can be retained and enriched, and another public library can be established elsewhere. With a large city area like Shanghai, one library alone is not enough to satisfy the citizens' desire for knowledge. Establishing more public libraries in different districts is also an important part of municipal construction, and the authorities should pay close attention to it.</p>
<h3>Student Number Four (4) Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>While praying for the protection of the gods, he also sighed at the Navy Military Academy for being so cautious. There probably isn't a school that chooses so carefully anywhere else, is there? It's just like a careful family's shop. I couldn't help but think of my late father and mother, who, before installing the rice milling machine, used to save rice every day, turning from the rough sieve to the fine sieve. But the ones that remained in the last sieve were the strong young men from Etajima that the Imperial Navy needed. Thinking of this, Zhenren's two red cheeks became even more flushed.</p>
<p>Before he knew it, he saw someone. A street lined with photo studios and laundries, but no restaurants. Zhenren's feet sped up. He slipped into the low school gate and reported to the doorman. The non-commissioned officer who was waiting for the students assigned him to the pre-admission dormitory. When he got to the dormitory, he saw that it was an ordinary large farmhouse.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>Although it was very different, the house was very spacious, the room was very tidy, and the toilet was very clean. Every year they have to be assigned to be dormitories, so the facilities are very complete. After Zhenren arrived first, his comrades also arrived one after another. Every time the regular steamer arrived, a batch of young men would be added to the dormitory. Among them were those who were sent by their mothers and brothers. The people who came with them seemed to live in another dormitory. The most gratifying thing was that in the last time, Xiongze from the military class also came.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, they were all young comrades, so they started to exchange greetings when they met. What surprised Zhenren the most was that he couldn't understand what people were saying. He had already decided that he must use standard language in the future. But even more difficult to understand than his words were the people from the Northeast. They also seemed to think that Zhenren's words were the most difficult to understand.</p>
<p>In any case, the words of those from Tokyo were all understandable. Moreover, the number of Tokyo people was so large that it surprised Zhenren. He had always thought that the weak young men in Tokyo were useless, but now he saw——</p>
<p>(The place where talents from all over the country gather, you can't slack off...) He remembered what his mother had said when he left.</p>
<p>The young men couldn't just sit idle in the dormitory. The guidance officer—the instructor came and went frequently, asking questions, so you couldn't be careless.</p>
<p>"Ichitani Jinren..." That instructor called his name. He had never met him before, how did he know his name? Zhenren was very surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes, Instructor!"</p>
<p>"In the Navy, you don't call your superiors 'Sir'!"</p>
<p>Zhenren bumped into a nail for the first time, and his face turned red.</p>
<p>"Tell me about your motivation for aspiring to the Navy!"</p>
<p>He poured out all the truth about this question.</p>
<p>"Okay. Next time it's Nakamura Saburo..." The instructor really knew the names of the prospective entrants very clearly. This was only known later, because the instructor compared the photos submitted and the opinion letters submitted by the school of origin, and before seeing the person, his impression of him was already clear.</p>
<p>On the 28th, there was another physical examination. This time it was in the school's infirmary. If he was examined with X-rays here, everything would be over, but Zhenren passed safely. Nakamura Saburo from Tokyo was examined for three days and finally failed. He received the round-trip fare from the school office and left the school dejectedly. It was really unbearable to look at. Even the military doctor who declared him unqualified couldn't help but turn his eyes to the side and his voice trembled. But the most fortunate thing was that only Nakamura failed this year.

<h3>Don't Buy Fake Tickets</h3>
<p>Last night, I invited a friend to see a play at the Grand Theater. Because it was the New Year, the seats were very popular, and we arrived late, so there were no good seats. Just as I was thinking, someone next to me suddenly offered to sell me tickets. He said: Because it was raining and his friend couldn't come, he planned to sell the tickets he had already bought. I took the tickets and looked at them. They were three seats in the middle of the first row, and I felt that the seats were good, so I paid the price and bought another ticket. Later, I accidentally looked at the front and back of the tickets, and suddenly saw something strange on the back. When I looked closer, I realized that the three tickets were for the daytime performance. Because the daytime and nighttime tickets of the theater were the same shape and color, except that the word "day" was marked on the back of the daytime tickets. I advise friends who buy black market tickets to be careful and not to buy fake tickets! (Shen Juncheng)</p>
