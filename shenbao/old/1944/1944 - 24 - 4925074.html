<h3>增產年與革新年</h3>
<p>今年元旦日，汪主席訓詞中特別提出：「今年的一年，應該是增產運動總動員的一年」。主席說：「為着動員人力物力貢獻於大東亞戰爭，我們要增加生產爲着充裕物資，調節物價，改善民生，我們要增加生產與；……我們尤其要保護生產力，培養生產力，增進生產力。……目前國計民生最急切的需要，一個是衣，一個是食，所以增產工作也就首先應該從農業輕工業着手。就算以目前力量之所能及，說不到足衣足食，也要合政府與人民的全力，使衣食問題得到合理而可能的解決。使一般民衆，尤其是生產民衆，在刻苦耐勞的去忍受戰爭期間不可免的痛苦之中，至少把那些層層煎迫的不必要之人為的痛苦，一步一步的解除。玫府方面要革除監調，拿出實際方案，沈着的去做，民衆方面羣力，脚踏實地去做。……盼望全國同胞，知行一致，一步步的做到。」</p>
<p>我們在元旦日社評中會提出：「今年是革新年」。期望政府領導人民實現革新的有三點，第一是「政治淸明」，從調整人事建立好人政府入手。第二是「解除民生疾苦」，從增加生產，抑平物價入手。第三是「實踐參戰」，必須充分做到上面的兩點以後，才能談到實踐參戰，否則徒一千空言，決無實際貢獻。最後希望政府自己革新！人民自己革新，同時督促政府革新！盟邦協助我們革新！</p>
<p>我們所以重複提引上面兩段的話，因為明天是廢曆新年，人民的習俗已深，大家都視為除舊佈新的一天，實際上却有一番新的氣象，我們就順着這一事實，再提供大家省察一次。</p>
<p>「增產年」與「革新年」，實際上是兩個口號而同一意義的。增產是要解除民生疾苦，貢獻協力作戰。可是，不先有革新的精神，不做到實際的革新，增產的目的還是不能達成，還是空言而已。主席說：「政府方面要革除濫調，拿出實際方案，沈着的去做」。這也就是我們所希望政府自己革新的意思。常然，「革新」決不是政府中少數人實踐了就能收效的，一定耍領導階層以身作則，上行下效，政府中盡是好人，使政洽淸明，然後增產方案可以執行，可以成功。主席又說：「民衆方面，也再不要袖手旁觀搖頭太息，而要羣策羣力，脚踏實地去做」。這也就是我們所布望人民自己革新的意思。嚴格的說，大民的革新，大半還是居於被動地位，袛要有好人政府，有實際方案，領導人民沈着去做，那末，人民一定不會袖手旁觀，必能羣策羣力，脚踏實地去做的。</p>
<p>「增產」是目的，「革新」是手段，希望今年要達到增產目的，非先革新決難收效。願朝野共同努力實踐革新！</p>
<h3>大東亞共同宣言　純基於道義精神　東條首相昨答覆議員質疑</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日衆議院總會，二十三日上午十時繼續開會，首由議員鶴見祐輔氏質問外交問題，繼由東條首相即席解答，茲誌其主要之問答如次：鶴見祐　問：「今首欲請政府解答者，為大東亞共同宣言與開羅宜言。按開羅宜言中曾言及日本以外之大東煎諸地域，此不外為英美擴張領土之野望與懷柔渝方之詭計而巳，然彼等何故仍以此等呼號為太平洋憲章耶。」東條首相答：「余等曾注意敵人對大東亞宣言將起如何反應，彼等最初表示默然，其後則於開羅會談發表一支離模糊之宣言，徵諸此即可明瞭大東亞共同宣言，已予彼等莫大之衝動。大東亞共同宜言亳無侵略色彩，而開羅宣言則為分取領土之布告。日本今所取者純為基於道義精神之政策，例如緬甸菲律賓之獨立，荷印及其他原住民之參政等，均為不可侵犯之光明正大事實　及之、試看彼等制壓下之印度及其他殖民地並美國之黑人問題，均成為榨取之對象。故相信開羅宜言，不外為奴隸其他民族之宣言」。</p>
<p>負建設新秩序使命已有事實昭示世界</p>
<p>鶴見氏問「大東亞宣言大西洋憲章之比較如何」東條首相答：「大東亞宣言並非僅謀大東亞民族之幸福者，宣言第五項言「與萬邦敦厚交誼，以貢戯世界之進展」，即為此意。又大東亞宣言與英美空洞之自由宣言相異，蓋大東亞宣言純為欲排除世界上之侵略榨取，撤廢人種差別者，此事能否實現，則完全視大東亞戰爭之成敗如何而定」。鶴見氏問，「英美不僅作　沉發船，摕射日軍近海之漁船，盲炸非武裝都市等暴舉，如紐約每日新聞更曾主張應於東京散放毒瓦斯，政府對敵此種非人道戰爭行為之對策如何」。東條首相答，一敵之非人道行為，實為人天所共憤，今日戰局困難雖多，但日本並未曾欲以非人道之行為打開此局面。日本之人道之態度，依據對俘虜之處置及某代表國之報告當不難明暸。若吾人對英美之非人道行為而報以非人道之手段，想全世界恐將成為野　之世界，敵人若始終作非人道之舉，吾人亦自將予以膺懲」。鶴見氏問，「敵人雖發表種種之戰後施策，而日本應否舉行日德義會議發表宣言，將軸心之世界觀發表於世界。」東條首相答，「日德義關係，非如英美之苟合，蓋日德義三國不僅具有建設世界新秩序之共同使命，且有一種由將兵之血所結成之不可分之關係，故無效法利害相反之英美之必要，吾人所採熊度恒以正義從事之，已由事實上昭示於世界，今後亦决採此種態度」。</p>
<h3>渝駐美大使　有更迭說</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城廿三日中央社電據華盛頓　，渝駐美大使館廿二日發表稱，大使魏道明為與蔣介石協義要務，己就　國之途，外傳蔣廷　將代魏道明繼任駐美大　之說。</p>
<h3>孟多上空　擊落美機廿架　日機大舉轟炸新島</h3>
<p>仰光二十三日中央社電日陸軍機隊會於二十日正午邀擊來襲日軍之美軍P40型機及包含噴火式戰鬥機隊三十架，將其還擊至孟多上空後，擊落其十五架，（內未證實者六架）是役日軍損害自炸一架，未返兩架，其後查明是役日機共擊落美機二十架，（內未證實者十架）日機兩架未飛返者，後亦安返基地，故日方損害僅有一架自炸。又日陸機隊後又轟炸孟多附近美軍陣地，予以重創，並在那夫河上炸況三百噸級敵船舶一艘。</p>
<p>阿根廷二十三日中央社電據新金山電。西南太平洋反軸心司令部二十一日發表：日軍航空部隊當大舉轟炸新不列　鳥阿羅埃地區宮比角地區之反軸心軍陣地。</p>
<h3>太平洋方面空戰激烈　十二月份敵機三千六百架來襲</h3>
<p>去年十二月份，敵機來襲所羅門·馬紹爾·新幾內亞·西南太平洋·印度洋及其他各地的次數如下表所示：</p>
<p>敵機來襲次數表</p>
<p>地區　次數　比率</p>
<p>所羅門　一六〇　四四·八</p>

<p>合計　三五七　一〇〇·〇</p>
<p>這數字所包括的，除所羅門，馬紹爾方面的要綫外，他如來襲新幾內亞方面的威華克，瑪諾加里，巴波，科加斯，法克法克，加麥那等；西南太平洋方面的西里伯，安本，帖木耳島的庫彭，合里，阿爾羣島，凱伊羣島等；印答　西南方　彭島等；及盤谷，幌筵等地的亦均包括在內。</p>
<p>來襲敵機機數表</p>
<p>地域　架數　比率</p>
<p>蘇羅門　二·一二六以上　五九·〇</p>

<p>其他　六三　〇·四</p>
<p>合計　三·六〇二以上　一〇〇·〇</p>
<p>依次數看時，十二月內敵機共計來襲三百五十七次，其中所羅門方面一百六十次·占全體的四四·八%；依來襲的機數看時，十二月內敵機來襲者共計三千六百〇二架，所羅門方面二千一百二十六架，佔五九%。其次是中部太平洋的馬紹爾羣島由這數字看來，可日敵空軍置其主力於南太平洋，中部太平洋方面　死命在突破日軍的要綫又各方面來襲的機數並飛機種如次表：</p>

<p>不明機　二五　一三·三</p>
<p>合計　一八九以上　一〇〇·〇</p>
<p>自上月十五日新不列　島馬加期　登陸以來，日趨激烈的所羅門戰綫方面，十二月份來襲的敵機二千一百二十六架中，戰鬥機占三六％，共七百七十四架以上。轟炸機九百十六架。為四三·二％。長距離轟炸機統一式B24型約近轟炸機數字巾的三分之一，這是很可注目的。</p>
<p>在馬紹爾方面，一千一百三十七架中，轟炸機五百三十七架以上，佔四八·一％；戰鬥機二百四十六架以上，佔二一·五％。戰鬥，轟炸機的比率，約相等於所羅門方面，又包括雙發動機的大型機，占全體的二三·一，可見其基地威力的交錯並不像所羅門方面一樣嚴密，而反映出地理的特色。</p>
<p>新幾內亞方面，也與前二者一樣，B24型所占的比率絞大。</p>
<p>西南方面，印度洋及其他各地，十二月內大都是偵察轟炸，機數極少。（翔：自一月十八日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>美戰爭目標動搖日外交陣容强化　重光外相答鶴見祐轉問</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電日衆院預算總會，二十三日繼續舉行，席上由鶴見氏就美國戰爭目的之動搖，美總統選舉問題所生之美國內政上之紛爭，及日本外交陣營之强化三項問題，提出質問。當由重光外相一一答覆如次：　美國戰爭目的之動搖實屬當然，蓋彼等缺乏偵正之戰爭目的也，美國將藉此機會在世界各地伸展其　權·戰爭目的係戰爭之魂，無魂之戰爭次不能獲最後勝利。衆信今日美國其戰爭之魂已呈動搖，彼等重視物質，常以提高生活標準等引誘國民，但在另一方面，甚至大西洋憲章亦竟公然謂不適用於印度，彼等為掩飾其新經濟政策之矛盾，乃謀從事政略戰爭，爭取亞洲之殖民地之戰爭，美國除此目的以外，寶無其他戰爭目的。美總統關於戰爭目的之說明，實為其動搖之表現，此即美國總統自開羅德黑關會議以來，其每次會談中矛盾殊多，實為當然。其於德黑會義中已澈底認識政治情勢，但返抵美國後，似已變更其態度，此不僅為開羅德黑商會議之影響，且太平洋方面戰况已充分支配彼等之頭腦，自義大利政變後，彼等曾發四極樂觀之論調，更發出一種「和平論」，謂戰爭即將結束，此種「和平論」與美國國民欲於短期結束戰爭之希望，其勢力極為强大，想美總統論覩太平洋及歐洲方面，之戰況後，其意見即改變也。當其見及美國國民始終希望戰爭短期結束之　况，乃向國會提出國民徵爭，然美總統競選即將屆臨，故羅斯福乃採取此稱態度，由此可見美國國內實無人和，此較之日本實有天壞之別，再就武力戰而觀，日本之人和實為最後勝利之一大保障，　關於外交方策，余以為將大東亞共同宣言之正義精神曉侃敵方，使其澈底明瞭日本正義之戰爭目的，亦為完成戰爭之一法，刻正極盡努力總統選舉問題，美國國民之不一可分為三，　對於戰爭之意見，　對於戰爭之疑惑，　對於國內選舉間題，但比皆敵國內部之事，吾人可置諸次要，吾人之要務乃在完成作戰目的，使敵人屈服也。</p>
<h3>日決撥款五十萬元補助滿國開墾農地</h3>
<p>新京二十三日中央社電日政府前决定以五十萬元撥入大東亞省追加預算，以充第一年度開墾滿洲國農地之補助金。茲滿洲國政府近交決定以其事業補助金連同右項預算，為康德十一年度追加預算，此項追加預算除用於開墾松花江及東遼河地方流域之水田若千公頃，而確立日滿盒糧自給態勢外，同時並用以開墾三江省鸛立岡及康德七年以來實施中之主要農地三處。該農地開墾計劃，期於二年之短時間內元成，故刻正着着進行準備與開墾事松花江同為該計劃之大事。東遼河流域方面自去年底起，巳由交通部從事治水工作，至其他工程亦由本年度起以二年之短期間完成之，合計開墾農地」達長野縣耕地面積之二倍强。</p>
<h3>日預算總會　昨開會情形</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電日貴衆兩院全體議會各特別委員會，二十二日均未開會，僅衆院豫算總會仍照常舉行。上午十時開會，依次由下列各氏就各項預算起立質疑，計外交方面鶴見祐　氏，軍需方面松村光三氏，小山倉之助氏，食糧方面三好信房氏，財政方面木村政翎氏。運輸方面喜多壯一郎氏，勞務方面河上丈太郎氏，航察方面松壽永雄氏，防空方面　井義道氏。</p>
<h3>距羅馬五十里　鏖戰進行中　英美軍在納吐諾登陸</h3>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電德軍當局發表：義戰綫之德軍二十二日與反軸心軍展開激戰後，巳自</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電德國新聞社訊：自克拉克將軍向第勒尼安海岸之突破企圖失敗後，英美軍為解救其在南義之困局起見，遂在羅馬之南及西南作大規模之登陸。在四日之廣大防禦作戰中，德軍不獨阻止敵軍向羅馬方面之突破，且將其逐退至迦田格利安諾平原。星期五日德軍重佔沿海山嶺之人口處及數處分路交又點，英美軍企圖橫過迦里格利安諾之中部及拉比杜之計劃亦遭挫敗，美第五軍在加西諾之突破已陷死地。而英第八軍在亞特里亞海之東翼亦不敢作大規模之攻勢。亞歷山大將軍在羅馬之南五十公哩之納吐諾（Nettuno）地方登陸及北方登陸之事實，足證德軍之優越，但德軍於堅决抵抗後退出納吐諾城</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電德軍當局說明反軸心軍在南義展開登陸作戰情形稱：反軸心軍於二十二日晨利用暗黑天氣，藉二日晨利用暗黑天氣，藉海空兩方砲火掩護下，在羅馬南方實行登陸。並在齊培爾河口與絕吐諾之中間地區設立橋頭堡。當時德軍部隊立即加以邀學，現花在激戰中。按義大利戰綫之戰况，數週來呈膠着狀態，反軸心軍戰術可謂「蝸牛戰術」。今後反軸心軍為打開局面，發動新登陸戰，此為德軍當局所預料者。</p>
<h3>陳璧君中委　蒞徐州視察　備受中日人員熱烈歡迎</h3>
<p>南京中央社徐州訊中委陳璧君日前來徐視察政治黨務社會情形，備受中日兩方軍政人員之熱烈歡迎，曾檢閱軍警及靑少年，親蒞各機關視察，對郝長官之勤勞舉公，盟邦方面之協力及民衆靑年爲佩慰，對此間民生改着及公共衛生民衆敎育之施設，尤為注意，並曾慰問盟邦陸軍病院，在該院應接室與盟邦軍兵團長會談要旨如左：（兵團長）去年年底主席施行手術經過良好實深同慶。（陳巾委）主席遇刺受創，曾兩度施行手術，　獲效果，此次經盟邦軍醫施行手術，於極短時間拔出背彈，日本醫學之優異，令人驚服。而經過良好，主席健康得以增進，尤可為中日合作同慶。（病院院長）去年主席駕蒞徐州敝病院長承賜慰問，今又受陳中委慰問，本院全體咸深感激。談話畢，陳中委即巡視各病室中作個別慰問並贈送慰勞品。陳中委對在徐一般部隊亦贈慰勞品，陳中委在徐視察時間想甚短促，對徐州地區軍官民所留印象極衆，尤以中央決定蘇淮改設淮灣省治，一般民衆靑年囚陳中委之蒞徐，對於民衆之激勵，影響甚太。陳中委返京時，除軍政要員外，一般民衆靑年，亦均沿途熱烈歡送</p>
<h3>東綫北路激戰未已</h3>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電德元首行營二十二日發　：　蘇軍曾於普利貝特河及貝勒基那河之間展開攻勢，經激戰後　被德軍擎退。　德軍二十一日於尼維爾北方將強力之蘇軍擊退，並將　軍局部之突出地予封鎖。　伊爾門湖蘇軍雖屢次實施反攻然均未得逞。　蘇軍於列寗格勒西南曾以強和之步兵及戰車部隊，企圖突破德軍陣地，然未得逞。</p>
<h3>大批德軍　開保境增防</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十三日中央社電據此間某報布達佩斯特電：大批德軍增强部隊，已到達保加利亞境內。</p>
<h3>阿根廷領事　在西印被捕阿政府發聲明</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城二十三日中央社電據阿根廷政府發表：該國領事赫爾姆特奉令赴歐洲途中，於英領西印度羣島之特立尼達島被逮捕。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二十三日中央社電關於特立尼達島阿根廷領事被捕事，英政府業正式通告阿外交部，原因係該領事有間謀　疑，至其眞相則未說明阿政府二十二日除巳交赫爾姆特解職外，並發表聲明如次：關於阿根廷戰內之外國諜報機關之活動，政府於種　事實明　，將實行澈底之調查，政府對背馳阿根廷外交政策之一切活動，決講求　切之取締措置。</p>
<h3>新任安徽羅省長昨舉行就職典禮　各廳長局長分別接任視事</h3>
<p>蚌埠二十三日中央社電　新任安徽省長羅君强氏，於二十二日上午十時到府接事，十一時舉行就職典禮，到中日各界代表及省府各廳處局長重耍職員等約五百餘人，行禮如儀後，首由羅氏致詞，以平正穩健漸進六字為推行省政原則，嗣由櫻庭大佐，森田總領事，谷川隊長等致賀詞。旋招待記者，發表談話，以確保治安，增强生產為省政重點。午宴中日來賓。下午二時新任政務廳長胡澤吾，建設廳長楊又春，保安處長郭爾珍，警務處長滿其蔚，經濟局長王翰章，糧食局長彭望軾等分別接收視事，並召集　員談話。淸鄉事務局長蔡英舜，明日將赴蕪覆新。</p>
<p>又電　安徽糧食局長彭望軾於二十三日對記老發表談話稱，本人此次奉命承乏皖省糧局，深感責任艱鉅，以後當奉中樞國家整個糧食政策，秉承省長指示，從事工作，值茲戰時體制下，糧食為國家整個之命脈，主席屢次昭示，今年為增產年，此後當努力增產為第一目標。皖南為產米區域，皖北雜糧出產豐富，但皖省米價昻貴，民食維艱，此後應以安定民食為第二目標，蓋如此方可謀同心協力，完成大東亞戰爭之後方工作。</p>
<h3>英美後方的苦悶</h3>
<p>美國</p>
<p>與任何交戰國一樣，美國也在學生和婦女間求取人力動員的預備軍。在這裹，民主政治是用不着的。右手把　獨裁的强權；左手揮舞「確保美國式享樂之盾」的羅斯福，將學生驅往戰錢，將婦女趕入工廠的事情是成功了。這種强迫的轉變，破壞了美國的生活秩序，在國內惹起種種問題，屢為外電所傳，茲將木曾提及的人力動員的實際情况，槪述如下：</p>
<p>學生</p>
<p>一，中學生對於由學生，動員他們去從事農業勞動。暑假期間固然不消說。在農忙時期也暫時停課，呌中學生到塲裹去工作。對於軍事訓練，特別是航空知識的灌輸，當局的致力程度，着實驚人。這從全國中學課程的根本改變看，可知一斑。</p>
<p>二，大學高專學生現在，美國的大學及專門學校都已化為預備士官學校。在陸軍方面，規定一百二十校，設立預備將校養　機關，施以十二週乃至四十八週的敎育，每年養成預備將校十五萬名。此外，復任命不屬上述學校的十八歲至二十六歲的在學學生為將校候補生，於在學期內予以航空專門敎育，畢業後召集，任為空軍預備將校。</p>
<p>在海軍方面，則設立海軍預備士官制度，適田此制的大學達數十所之多，錄取在學學生的志願者，在四個月的預備訓練後，於軍官學校或指定的大學再受三個月敎育，即任之為預備少尉。此外並從專門學校學生選取海軍陸戰隊及沿岸警備隊的預備士官。</p>
<p>再則，陸海軍雙方對於志願投效航空的學生，除實行徵兵猶預以外，並以將校任用，予以種種優待，竭力訴諸學生的美國式虛榮心，努力補充航空要員。</p>
<p>婦女</p>
<p>兵力在量方面的增大，當然招致勞動力的不足。這種不足的補方法，其一就是動員婦女。美國勞動力的三分之一，必須依賴歡女，美國政府除實行投她們所好的方策以博歡心外，必要時且不辭出以强制動員的高壓手段，使美國婦女就範。</p>
<p>美國十八歲到四十九歲止的生產年齡女子，全部三千三百萬，其中可以勞動的婦女人數，據說有一千六百五十萬。據一九四三年的調查，女性勤勞人員達一千六百萬，是則女子動員殆已達到限界。一九四二年五月美國全產業的女性就業率，為一四·六％，翌年五月為二七·二％，幾增一倍。女工取代男工的情形，由此可見一斑。尤其是飛機工廠，職工的三分之一是女性，到一九四三年末，據說己超過一半。這和戰前女性從業員僅二％比較，美國婦女的盡力戰爭生產，可知已相當大了。</p>
<p>美國婦女不僅進出工廠，並且還加入軍隊。一九四三年末的陸海軍動員計劃，是一千八十萬人，不足額的兵員由婦女補助隊彌補。去年七月二十日，美國娘子軍共六萬五千名，據當局的宣傳。將來可擴張到六十萬。再則，職業的性質也漸漸接近男子，從鐵路與汽車從業員。消防隊。鎔接工廠起，甚至加八屠宰塲。</p>
<p>國民生活　　食美國民衆的生活程度非常高，因此可以抑低到相當程度，單從表面的數字判斷，頗難和況頗人民的生活狀况直接比較。不過、糧食狀况頗為迫切，則是事實。蓋莫大的兵員和軍需產業的吸收勞動力，必然引起農業勞動力的不足，因而本年末糧食方面將遭遇相當的危機。去年十月二十日，美國農務長自魏卡特曾稱：一美國農村勞動力最感不足，其他機機類也頗缺乏，糧食的增產將陷入危機。</p>
<p>二·衣著服裝如短統皮鞋·去年二月限制每人一年三雙，十月减為二雙；襪子自周年十月起，十五歲以上女子每人一年九變（大半為人造絲製成）。男女衣服也因國內存貨減少，下令節約，實行簡易化，不久或將施行憑票購買制。又因媒斤缺乏，紙漿不足，報紙也減少張數。此外，並竭力收集舊襪，破衣等，作為再造的原料。因此，惟物質數量是賴的美國，其自信心也慢慢動搖了。這種內部的不安和動搖，我們當然不應該過分倚重，但由此至少可以認識對方的弱點所在。</p>
<p>英國的國民生活，就全體言，可說已達極限。美國的國民生活雖然比較曩昔困苦，但美國的困苦彷彿是小孩子的困苦，總還有些餘裕，而英國的困苦，則在一切都總動員了之後而有的，恰如拉長到極限的像皮條一樣。蓋英國旣比美國早捲入戰渦二年三個月，又受到相當猛烈的轟炸，而且除出煤炭以外，各項物資尤多不能自給自足，但是却非繼續從事消耗極大的戰爭不可，所以其國民生活所受的壓迫如何深刻，很容易想像。</p>
<p>財政狀况</p>
<p>英國去年度的預算，和前年度的預算比較，僅增一億五千萬鎊，這種情形，和這次大戰勃發以來，每年增加十億鎊内外的情形比较，不得不認為是英國生產力　達限界的證據，即人力·資材·設備都到飽和狀態，已經沒有再行投資的餘地了。再則，直接稅似亦達到限界，來比前年增加，因此，除自然增加之外，僅賴間接稅的增加，因此，除自然增加之外，僅賴間接稅着國家歲出的膨脹，國民消費資金逐漸受壓迫，生活水準已比一九三八年釘低二〇％。然一般物價，特別是生計費，英國政府的對策是奏功了。自一九四一年以降，大體尙算安定，生活費指數的上昇，比戰前未曾超過三〇％。對於國家的　機，國民的訓練在財政方面也充分發揮其功效，戰時歲出固然龐大，但今日尙無惡性通貨膨脹之慮。惟不拘工資已提　六〇％以上，要求增薪的罷工事仍漸漸增加，却表明英國的經濟狀態已到水窮山盡無論怎樣都个行的地步了。茲舉英國最近的物價指數於後，以資參考。</p>
<p>生活物資其次，激勵及維持國民士氣最馬重要的生活必需物資問題如何呢？第一是糧食問題。關於英國的糧食，一般頗抱樂觀？以為英國的糧食課題是交戰國中最惡劣最困難的，然而事實上還不能看做已窘迫到那個地步。前次大戰時，德國潛水艇大顯威風，嚴密封鎖英國本土，以致英國本部的存糧僅數數日之用，一時情勢岌岌可危。其後英國鑑於這種苦痛的經騐，自這次大戰以前起，即苦思竭慮，研究對策，强化眝藏。開戰以後，更努力增加糧食產量，限制消費，確保輪入，結果我們不得不率直承認他們正維持着比歐洲各國更好的水準。不過，在遂行北非作戰，西西里作戰等的時候，由於船舶的不足，從美國及其他地方的蝓人激減，英國政府也曾慌忙以食糧難警告國民，所以今後如實行他們所呼號的建立歐洲第二戰綫那樣的大作戰時，其影響當然深刻反映於糧食的需給關係上，英國政府將陷於不得不再行發出警告的狀况中吧。英國本部的食糧自給狀况，據去年農務部發表，必要食糧的三分之二可以自給。但重要物資依賴海外的程度依然很大，易為船舶問題所左右。德國潛水艇的活動，如一直像最近一樣比較不激烈，英國要維持現在這種糧食自給水準，恐無困難。惟德國潛水艇自去秋以來，已改裝竣事，攻擊力大見增强，所以英國的前途當然不許樂觀。</p>
<p>糧食的限制消費，以開戰直後的—九四〇年一月八日對醃猪肉，火腿，奶油，砂糖實行限制為濫觴，其後遂漸擴大限消費的範圍，惟麵包，馬鈴薯，魚類，蔬菜等重要食品尙未施行配給制。滬可目為食糧需給關係上比較尙有餘裕的一個左證。</p>
<p>至於衣料，自一九四一年六月一日起，採用票劵制，第一年度每人十二個月六十六點，第二年度減為十五個月六十點（一年四十八點），自去年九月起，進入第三年度，結果似更減少一〇％。就全體觀，第一年度約當平時消費量的一半，第二年度減為三分之二，第三年度更減一成，所以纖維製品的需給，可視為己相當窘迫。至於燃料，寒冷的英國需要煤斤孔殷，然因勞力不足，產量相當減少，英國政府雖然屢欲實施配給制，然因格於議會的反對，尙未能够實行，今後將陷人更為困難的地步。</p>
<p>住宅問題</p>
<p>因軍需工業繁榮而生的人口分佈不勻，空襲轟炸所致的房屋損燬（前年末止，共三百萬戶），以及基於建築材料缺乏而限制　築等，佳宅問題也相當嚴重。</p>
<p>其他因橡膠，皮革，金屬類不足而限制日用品的供給，對於一般國民生活，顯然頗多不便。紙張的缺乏尤其顯著；新聞用紙的配給，據說不到戰前的五分之一。肥皂也自前年二月起實施配給制，現仍深感不足云。（吉：譯自一月八日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>統制出版界</h3>
<p>— 汪德</p>
<p>近日無物不漲，書籍列物也不能例外，薄薄一本書總要售四五十元，但這究竟不可與柴米油鹽可比，缺少就不能生活。况且米媒油糖已有配給。不過書報雜誌亦是精神糧食，對於一國的文化影響很大，所以出版界更有統制的必要。</p>
<p>若能到幾家日本書店去走走，一定要讚嘆不止一本很厚的刋物，項多只售七八十錢，且內容都很充實，種類繁多，就是釣魚也有釣魚雜誌。至於一般的書籍也極便宜，裝訂考究，紙張很好，時有新版書出版，日本的出版界所以發達，不受戰爭影響因為有了統制，他們對於戰時文化工作是很重視的。</p>
<p>為求我國文化的發揚，戰時意識的促進，希望當局對出版界快點也有統制的組織，現以管見所及，貢獻意見數點如左。</p>
<p>紙張為出版物的主要原料目前紙價飛漲，一半果然生產量減少，物希為貴，一半是紙張准許自由買賣，致為投機的籌碼，囤積的對象。故若有統制機關則對紙廠獎勵增產，設法疏通造紙原料的來源，及全盤收買所有紙貨，與新製成品一起配給。</p>
<p>現在刋物雖然出版很多，至於內容不是風花雪月，便是空洞無物的所謂「報銷文化」，正當的書籍可說沒有，各大書局只在賣賣存貨。若統制機構成立對於原料有了辦法，成本減低，再將各物刋加以調整與取締，有的可以合併，並獎勵眞正有價值的書籍出版。</p>
<p>印刷也是出版的物成本的大部份，現在排字的工價反而比絞盡腦汁的作者稿費大，所以對印刷工人的生活應有合理的解决，不要儘是加工錢來解决，還有印刷原料也要連帶統制配給，並防止印刷商過分的剝削應訂立嚴格而公允的限價。</p>
<p>文人的生活困苦可以與小學敎師一樣捉襟見肘，試問那有好文章可讀，有力者早已改了行，故別的成本滅低，對於稿費則須增加至適當限度，並訂立獎勵辦法，對一般有貢獻的作者加以鼓勵，那末出版界的水準才可提高，內容才能充實了。</p>
<p>再有發行，日本早有一個配給組合，實行統一批發，這樣可以取締中間商的剝削，至於書價可以以成本加公定的利潤定了公允的價格。</p>
<p>如此出版商有了保障，可不再視出版是畏途，我們讀者亦可有好的書看，便宜的書買，諺曰知書達理；不但如此，而且我國的文化也賴於發揚與淮步，希望出版界的統制機構能早日成立，救救出版高，救救作者謮者。</p>

<h3>大喜劇「雙囍臨門」明日隆重獻演　助學義演新年節目較樑上君子更風趣</h3>
<p>苦幹為本報助學義演第二劇「　上君十」，也圓滿結束了。演出的結果，情形不但較「飄」更為熱烈，而且開了一年來話劇界所未有的盛况。</p>
<p>現在苦幹的新春新劇目「雙囍臨門」，也將於明天（甲申元旦）起在巴黎大戲院陸軍獻演了。</p>
<p>苦幹預定的第三劇目原是「機器人」，但為了要適合新年的演出，適合一般觀衆的口味，所以特別選定了姚克編劇，胡響庵導演的大喜劇「雙囍臨門」。劇中描寫兩對年靑的情人，相約私奔，不期在中途一個旅舍中相遇，這旅舍的主人，又是一位月下老人式的熱心家，設就牢籠，巧適妙計，把這兩對情人捉弄得昏頭昏腦，發生許多匪夷所思的趣劇，結果使他們各就所愛，言歸於好。演員陣容中，如白文·沈敏·上官雲珠·王駿·白穆等等，本是劇壞最有成就的演員，在「雙囍臨門」中更有可觀的成就。看過「樑上君子」的無數觀衆，一定可以在「雙囍臨門」中得到更大的滿足。</p>

<p>明天是春節了。大家在習俗上不免有餽贈宴聚之舉，我們絕不厚非有所不當，不過希望讀者諸君在餽贈宴聚之際，想到較此更有意義的助學運動。從中節省若干捐充助學金，不以數微而不為。集腋可以成裘，鉅款細數　我們同樣的歡迎。</p>
<p>今天起至二十七日之四日間　是我們休假期間，但讀者捐輪助學金，我們特派人員接受，請交本報庶務處。在此期閭，我們深盼讀者節約助學，及早達到三百萬元目標。</p>

<h3>海軍　岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯　軍人班（三）</h3>
<p>前途是巳經决定了。這回可是不動的决心。就使櫻鳥爆發，甲突河倒流，此志不移——</p>
<p>「你若是那麼决定了，也好……。父親，眞一郎，都被陸軍徴去了的，海軍是一個人也沒有……」母親狠爽快地允許了。並且還添上一句，早在明治十七年的時候，有一個伯父，當過水兵——</p>
<p>事已如此，是毋須再隱蔽的，所以眞人，對隆夫也發表了。那時候，經夫的歡喜，不知不覺手舞足蹈起來，互相宣誓了二人同做海軍軍官，共同生死。隆夫買了兩張在那年五月三十日薨去的東鄉元帥的額面照片，一張送給了眞人。</p>
<p>眞人到現在為止，是以鄉里的老名士來崇拜東鄉元帥，而於今更加上一層意義，同時又是自己志望的海軍的老前輩。然而對東鄉元帥的認識，並不怎樣深切，只是（東鄉老，偉大的……）也不過是這種程度。他知道元帥的眞正價值，是在很久以後的事情。</p>
<p>這樣看來，他志望海軍的遠因，是在那暴風雨之日讀了「　英戰爭餘話」，而近因就在軍事參觀團，到江田烏去的時候，聽到穿白制服的當直軍官的講話。「諸君，大概都知道我國軍艦的艦首上輝煌着的徽章吧。為什麼我園軍艦上都有卞六瓣菊花的紋章——那就是明示着，日本海軍是天皇的海軍。在法律上，事實上都是如此的。這是人人必須知道的事情，而不知道的人却很多。况且日本海軍的建設者是訛，也有很多的人不知道，這實在是……　　白制服的軍官，將日本海軍是明治時代建設的，在明治時築成了大海軍的基礎的經過，講述了一遍。在明治元年的閲兵式中，聚到大阪港的軍艦，僅有六艘，總噸數是二千四百五十二噸——那到四十年後的十一月，明治天皇最后的神戶舉行觀艦式時，艦數一百二十三隻，總噸數已達到四十萬四千四百六十噸，少年們聰到道樣大的數字的差別，不期而同的露出驚異的神色。</p>
<p>一在明治天皇一代之間，建設了這樣的大海軍，這都是明治天皇的豐功偉業。試舉一例言之，在明治二十五年，海軍省向議會提出了戰艦二·巡洋艦一·通報艦一的造艦預算時，否决的情勢極見濃厚。明治天皇當時深為聖憂，以後天年之間，每年節省宮廷費三十萬圓，贈與日本海軍……」</p>
<p>白制服的軍官的聲音，忽然地中斷了。那個聲音，到現在還留在眞人的耳鼓中。</p>

<p>方今時艱未已，多數人民生計益痛，演寒之家子女敎育不繼者，不可勝計，此豈華華學子之不幸，實亦社會上有力之士所應引為內疚者也·余續書不多，側身商界，對於失　靑年，深抱同情，常思力有所逮，當盡助學之願。</p>
<p>申報倡始助學運動，歷屆成績卓著。余以未盡棉力，殊為遺憾。但鑒於事變以還，商界人士，擁資纍纍者，比比皆是，何以助學金之捐輸，未見其慷慨熱烈耶？當此世亂方股，大多數同胞生活之慘痛，不言可喩。慘痛孰令致之？竊以商賈之掀風作浪，似亦未能辭其咎也！然而世事未可逆料，財錢究屬身外之物，余謹以十二萬熱忱，奉勸商界人士，處此風雨同舟之局，正是發揚人類互助情神之大好機會，與其積儲遇溢之財，以貽後惠，不如多行積德之事，造福人軍。語云「損有餘，補小足」，以我之有餘，補人之不足，於我無害，於人有利，誠何樂而不為也·當今時艱，有餘力助人，可謂最幸福之人，而助人之目標，當助與有志之優秀靑年。捐輸助學金，培植可造之材，以期服務社會，復興國家，造福人羣，豈非佳事。余服務商業，自慚棉薄，於社會無多貢獻。現擬籌集的款，捐輸助學，一俟舊歷新　，即當送繳申報當局。敬勸商界有力之士。蠲除惟利是圖之思想，啓發行善從德之精神，共同贊助申報讀者助學金運動。</p>

<h3>潛水海底奮戰記</h3>
<p>喊　「他媽的！快拿子彈來！……」的，受車場面成為一隻手一條腿的步兵，昨夜在狹灰的監內，翻大覆地地呌　和　駡，而終於鳴呼哀哉了。看　運　悲慘的景象，聽　　裡喊呌，有一位對我說：「從令　沉敵方船艦那面英勇行動，也毫無動於心，從令夜以繼日地在敵方飛機與艦艇的壓迫下，神經麻木，被迫作戰，但也從未忘掉打通的任務」。這就是赴新幾內亞執行打通任務，今早返歸〇〇基地的潛水艇長所說的話。他因操勞過度，兩限深陷於眶內，微微地閃　炯光。所謂打通，乃是鐵鯨勇士們得暗語，即以潛水艇執行補充運輸之意。「新幾內亞的戰爭，是我們用肉彈對抗敵人的鋼鐵和飛機」，這是前幾天搭乘打通潛艇的一位陸軍部隊長，憤然所說的：但事實上，決不單純是新幾內亞如此，　拉摩阿·拉耶·芬希哈罕，何嘗不都是如此呢？下面就是隨着後台主角，到新幾內亞去進行海底打通的戰記。</p>
<p>蚊蚤的進攻</p>
<p>「他媽的，今天晚上跳蚤和蚊蟲又來騷擾了！」這是高大的美髯公艦長，從眼睛上拿下雙管望遠鏡來，仰視着天空，大聲喊出來的話。在天空上，斜掛着一個大佛面孔上　毛一樣的月芽，被細沙般得白雲，薄薄地蓋着，這樣更顯出月姐的姣嫩。帶着向〇〇地運輸補充重任的〇〇號潛水艇，在月色朦朧裏，冲着銀色的浪花，筆直地，雄壯地向前猛進。</p>
<p>雙手把着望遠鏡，對在眼睛上，毫不動轉的艦橋瞭望員，正好像著名的匠人彫刻城的塑像。某號瞭望員，突然破鑼般得嗓子，高聲喊出：「左二十度魚雷艇！」，這個聲音的餘波，尙紫繞於耳邊的時候哦了，哨戒長又突然發出震耳的號令：「入水潛航！」接着艦內緊急電鈴就響撤雲霄了。方才艦長所嚷的跳蚤，是指地方魚雷所說的。在這一帶旣是月夜，當然跳蚤羣是猖獗橫行的，甚至黑夜。跳蚤也是相當拔扈的。在南海潛航以防爆雷的艦內，雖然時間相當短促，但人們都像在汽鍋被蒸的樣子，不僅汗流浹背，且透不過起來，眞是難於忍受。現在在艦內。滿滿地裝着東西不必說，甚至甲板上也還裝着〇〇噸的彈藥，食　，醫藥品等，另外還有步兵〇〇名也和我們在一處，所以空隙簡直可以說沒有，刺鼻的氣息，不準活動地擁擠着，所有艦內的人，都不能不像拉滿的弓那樣緊張。</p>
<p>這樣難過的時間終於過去了，似乎地方魚雷艇也走遠了，所以在傳聲管中，傳出「浮出水面」的號令。然而跳蚤去後，蚊虫飛機又來了。突然現在水面的潛艇，在望遠鏡裏看到紅色的燈，像流動的星光一樣。於是，緊急的電鈴又在夜裏不斷地響了。眞是休談睡覺，即是坐坐也不可能。在許多討厭的地方飛機和艦艇的控制下，反要在規定的日期把貨送到，這就是潛艇運輸的勞苦。上自艦長下至兵士，一出基地後，就不得眨一眨眼，只能回去後，才有可能睡一覺。</p>
<p>敵前浮出</p>
<p>椰子和曼格羅夫樹森林，都被炮火和子彈燒焦了。從潛望鏡裏遙望着〇〇號島岸的艦長似乎在出神。業已到了指定登陸地點。幸而空中沒有飛機的影踪。「浮出！」「靠岸！」「前後開窗！」這類一連串的號令，由傳聲筒裏傳播出來。卸貨工作人員，早已跳出到甲板上，因只能一人出入的大小的窗口裏，按着次序，把彈藥和醫藥品等拖出去。這種工作，眞是人類所想不到的迅速敏捷。否則，就有很多危險可能性，是誰也不敢斷定，敵方飛機將從甚麼地方，和在甚麼時候會來的。同時，誰也不敢斷定，跳蚤在甚麼地方虎視眈眈地注意着我們。</p>
<p>然後除了自己的基地以外，原則上是絕對不應　把天窗打開的。而現在這樣打開天窗，實際上就等於在敵前打開天窗。所以對於卸物，就一分鐘一秒鐘也要爭取的。一切都託付到瞭望員身上，而其餘大家權都手忙脚亂地搬運貨物。在自己基地需要十小時以上裝的時間的彈藥和醫藥品，在此地却僅僅半小時就卸完了，這樣緊張的工作，只有鋼鐵般得身體才能担當得住。從這一點，也可以看出潛艇勇士精神力的偉大。</p>
<p>歸時為傷病船</p>
<p>把精神百倍的陸軍士卒送走後的潛艇，現在又迎接傷病和病兵了。彼打斷腿和打斷胳臂的兵，被惡性瘧疾所糾纏的兵，一個一個地從天窗上落下來。全都是不知明天死活的重傷者，重病者。眼球深深地陷下去，蓬頭垢面，表現着非常難看的樣子。甚至全身上，包裹着一層濕疹，黃色膿水不斷地流着，各個小膿疱裏，都滿藏着小的蛀虫。身上雖穿着名字呌作衣服，實際上，完全是血汗，泥垢，濕氣，熱氣，砲灰等腐噬的襤褸軍裝所纏包着，無論誰，全都是放在什麽地方就在什麽地方，甚至伸伸腰抬抬頭的都沒有。</p>
<p>年青的軍艦長，庫　此處硬碰彼　地在進行　應急診治·道時，潛艇　已潛入水中在航行着，甲板上的食道袋都在搖　着。於是〇〇名的生命，就可保證〇天了。現在的任務，只剩下了一個，則是把傷兵病兵安全送往基地。然而這也是一件不容易的事。大聲哭呌的陸軍兵士，並不讓　班完畢的水手們小睡一下，水手們只好再進行　士的責任。吃飯需要服侍不必說，即大小便也得帮忙。怎看來，好像母親駝着病兒一樣，有時是抱在懷裏，喂飽　頭果汁。這樣不勝其煩，而疲憊得不堪。身穿着油膩和血汁浸透的防着服，面孔上掛着和　　分不清的黑色泥垢，滿充着血色的眼睛，疼痛得不敢看人。就是這樣的一副眼睛，還需要煩勞牠們在艦橋上瞭望〇小時。</p>
<p>鐵鯨的心在勉勵和申斥着我們：『不要讓傷兵和病兵死去！』同時，鐵鯨急急不停地，戴着滿身創傷　痛而不能動轉的戰友，向基地一路邁進。全體傷兵和病兵，在水手們的背上馱着，啜泣着，哭訴着，發誓捲土重來。</p>
<p>又一次是快呀！快呀！地喊着，手脚不停地，向〇〇地進行得打通。暴風雨來勢非常兇惡。附近和周回，是伸手不見掌的黑夜。夾雜着砰砰隆隆的槍砲聲。於是在對面遠處，不時看到紅的綠的曳光彈。這就是〇〇地我軍在展開了夜襲戰。正在這個時候，一個瞭望兵高聲喊呌：「左九十度飛機！」我們尙在進行卸貨中。說時遲那時快，隨着「火速潛航！」的命令，前後方的天窗九關閉起來，潛艇立刻就潛入水底，迅速航行了。甲板上剩下的下作人員、在黑暗的海中，一直游泳到飛機離去。</p>
<p>對米飯而痛苦</p>
<p>當夜所收容的陸軍傷兵中，有一位官佐對我們艦長說：「我是〇〇都隊的營長〇〇少校，請特別關照！」一看此人，原來是穿着破爛不堪的軍服，肩章早已失掉，左手握着一把軍刀，只這一點可以證明他是一位軍官，該營長一看到火夫作得香噴噴的米飯送到而前時，不自禁地說了一聲：「唉呀，這是米飯！」於是眼淚汪汪地便哭起來。看到這種情形的大家，也都低下頭而熱淚　流了。</p>
<p>「只給身體不能動轉的傷兵吃兩個飯團。那也不過是小孩拳頭大小的飯團，因為手轉不過來，所以傷兵吃完後只能在森林內躺着。能動轉者，就喝稀飯。米袋因海水的浸濕，米都發起來了，就以這樣的米作稀飯。以十五天的稀飯口糧份，作四十天來吃。如果我們想到潛艇這樣運輸不容易，就是褐稀飯也是應當的。」距離〇〇基地就剩〇〇海里了。暴風雨仍然非常劇烈。</p>
<p>就從這個暴風雨中，突然鑽出一艘敵方的驅逐艦來。在急速潛航的潛艇頭上，是接一連二地響澈雲霄的爆雷。三小時，五小時……敵方的壓迫，是非常執拗而頑强的。終於〇〇小時後，蓄電池的放電量逐漸增加，結果再過不久將全部用盡。因被傷兵知道，這是不可以的，所以艦長强顏作笑着，但在內心裏，却是暗暗訴苦。天將要亮了，好容易擺脫了這個痛苦。</p>
<p>勝利品</p>
<p>「巡洋艦十艘，驅逐艦五艘所護送的敵方運輸艦　，北上中。似向〇〇地企圖登陸」！電報員拍發這時電報的時候，是剛完成了運輸工作，正在潛航中的某月某日晚上。</p>
<p>艦長對着傳聲筒發着　狗呌的聲音之號令：「針路〇〇度！」「向前直駛：」——此時暴風雨好像要震起來一樣，天色發暗的海上，飛馳着，視綫模糊不清。能夠看見者，只是潛艇頭部所衝碎的波濤，以及船尾兩傍分開的白色浪紋。在每一個人的心裏，都是躊躇愈試地攻擊敵人之意欲。</p>
<p>「勝也好，敗也好。總而言之，讓陸軍弟兄們看看我們的本事」。逐漸逼近敵人，似乎本國的飛機業已與敵開火了。潛艇的前面，距離〇公里處。急速潛船的潛艇，拼命前進。放射魚雷早已準備好。隨着號令「角度向右」，「準備」，「放射」，便把魚雷一個一個地放出去。經過了〇分〇秒時間，打破了沉寂聲，而「轟轟咚咚」的擊中爆炸聲，震得耳鼓疼。數月以來，從未得到這樣的戰果，今天大家都眉開眼笑了。</p>
<p>敵人在我們水中和空中的夾擊下，有地沉沒了，有地大破了。結果完全失敗。高奏凱歌同到原防時，基地的椰子樹也覺得格外悅人。明天還是運輸食糧和彈藥等的工作，此次是向〇〇地運輸的。今天晚上，一定可得到一個甜蜜的夢吧！（大魯譯自十二月三十一日讀賣報知新聞）</p>

<h3>解放了得人</h3>
<p>— 斐</p>
<p>H女中宿舍中錢之善德年齡最大些，大家都喊她大姐；加之　的世俗經驗也的確比其餘的人豐富得多，也就當之無愧了。</p>
<p>目前她正忙着一件事，聽她對朋友們說話的語氣，就知道是非常嚴重了；「這是關於我一生幸福的事，我非解放自己不可，誰阻止了我，誰就是我得敵人！」空時她和同學們說起自己來，總是越說越有勁的，好像她的　世說不完似的：</p>
<p>「我的脾氣很壞，我從小就很有主張的，家裏連哥哥都沒有讀書，我一定要讀書，因為我知道讀了書才可以談自由解放，直到現在我還是這樣，我有我一貫的目標，誰也阻不了，只要是合乎眞理的事我就不顧一切的去做！譬如……」她總是舉例很多，滔滔不絕的半帶矜持地批評着自己。</p>
<p>這件大事辦理的結果，據說還是她勝利。一天一個胖男人來看她了，年紀也不過廿多歲，隨腫的臉上嵌着兩顆小眼睛，闊大德鼻頭配着一張大嘴；裹着橄欖核似身體的，却是筆挺的西裝。她雀躍地招呼着他。親熱地拉着他進來：</p>
<p>「你就在我們宿舍裏來坐一會吧！」她又很大方地轉向各位同學們：</p>
<p>「好，我來替你們介紹介紹，這位孔先生，是我的一朋友。」以後又密司密司的介紹了一陣？</p>
<p>「是就是！怕你們這些孩子們嗎？」她看了胖子一眼，扭着頭撒嬌地而又老練地說。</p>
<p>於是胖子慷慨地請了糖，雙雙地出去了。</p>
<p>次日，大姐又有很多話要發揮了：</p>
<p>「說正經話，我和他的愛情也經過了不少的磨折呢！我從小就和一個姓王的訂了婚，那是一個無用的家伙，雖然是個大學生，面孔倒還漂亮，只是土頭土腦的，我和他在一起時，只覺得他什麽都不懂；同時我已和姓孔的有了愛情，於是我一定要解除婚約，和我母親哥哥交涉了多時，我情願犧牲了家庭的感情！孔先生還用了不少的錢呢！其實用點錢眞不算什麽，自己得到了解放總是快樂的。」</p>
<p>「那麼這位姓孔的有什麽特別的好呢？」小明問。</p>
<p>「他是很時代化的，什麽都知道年紀很輕，已經做了幾個紗布號的經理了。而且他的思想很新，他也剛和妻子離了婚，也是反對舊禮敎，主張解放的。」</p>
<p>「爲了愛情與解放，他用了很不少得錢呢！」她又說。</p>
<p>「請你別氣，姓孔的很不漂亮呢！」小明還是不識相。</p>
<p>「哈：你們到底是小孩子，單講漂亮還算眞愛情嗎？我們愛情的偉大就在這裏！而且他又不是女人。</p>
<p>「站在互助解放的立塲上，才是最有意義的愛情！」</p>
<p>「我們都是從家庭中解放出來了，彼此都是同志呢！不對舊勢力屈伏，這才是青年的本色！」她的語氣是夠堅强的，像一個戰士，令大家敬服不已。</p>
<p>二月後，錢文善　　了，爲了結婚，半年後就生了孩子，眞是雙喜臨門，美滿得很。只是爲了收買紗布，孔先生的事業不大景氣。</p>
<p>「之善！孩子這兩天病着，你今天不要打牌吧！」</p>
<p>「不！你不應該命令我！女子解放你懂不懂？你要我一天到晚躲在家裏看孩子嗎？你自己假說爲了交易，倒跳舞看戲的自在得很，男女平等！要澈底解放！你能管我嗎？」</p>
<p>男的不再　了，是的，她是自己解放了的人，是不能再束縛她的了。</p>
<p>於是男的出去了，女的到客堂裏又麻將，乳娘帶着孩子逛馬路，姨娘在廚房裏燒飯。</p>
<p>「孔太太，你們孔先生眞好，我家的冤家吵死吵活不許我打牌呢！」隔壁的張太太說。</p>
<p>「現在女子都從家庭中解放出來了，他還能管我嗎？解放的意思，就是現在家裏，誰也不能管誰！」</p>
<p>「你眞福氣，夫婦都懂得解放，一對解放了的人組織着一個快樂的小家庭！」一桌上三個人都羡慕着她。她也洋洋自得了</p>
<h3>兩天的歌　——聆國立音專聲樂季考</h3>
<p>— 可均</p>
<p>這是一個細雨連濺的早晨，信步踏着被雨絲打得　濕的街道，無目的地義着。從一條馬路到另一條，從西區已到了中區。</p>
<p>在近愛文義路卡德路的一角，迷惘地被一支歌聲所吸引了，歌聲是從那紅色的半舊的洋房裏透露出來的，面那房子正是我一年以前走得很熟悉的國立音專：又該是季考的時候了吧！我的心不禁為之一動：正愁沒法消磨這風雨的早晨，而上帝却給我安排了這樣一個偶遇。</p>
<p>小禮堂並不因為天雨而早已擠得滿滿的了，門口還站了一羣。這已是近十一點鐘了，節目早已開始，於是我就問旁邊一位先生借了二張程序單，靜靜的在廊子裏站着，一邊，豎起了耳朵儘量地吸收從人縫間傳出的音節。當目光接觸到程序單的最末時，我簡直想跳起來的高興；是兩個長長的升級考的項目，而且多半的歌都是我平日所最喜愛而熟悉的：壓台的考試者，又是茅愛立女士。久聞音專多樂一個名女高音，一直沒機會領略，而今天却能在這樣一個偶遇塲合下，不費力的聽到，這眞是上帝的特賜。</p>
<p>可惜我來的太遲了！這時，第十位考試者已唱完，有幾個聽衆從裏邊退出，門口鬆動了些，我乘勢擠進了考塲。第十一位是男高音，高音的確很動聽，可是低音很含糊、且歌詞不清，態度咨勢欠佳，實在有改善德必要。第十二位男高音，音色尙稱不　，但技術修養還不足。第十三位是一個姓玉的男高音，所唱的一個歌劇可屬上乘，但可惜有幾處裂音。第十四位男低音姓齊、我奇怪這些學唱者姓的奇突，玉齊·茅，大概是不可多得之才，一定該有不可多得的姓吧！男低音音色極佳，如在技術方面多努力，異日必不可限量。第十五位是女高音李天　升級考，不知何故竟缺席，接着就是茅女士登台了！</p>
<p>第一唱的是Exercise，一支很動人的華而滋，但不知爲什麽，也許是我希望的太高了，也許是茅愛立有點害怕，歌聲並不與我所期望似的嘹亮。第二三支是中文歌，聲聲慢與天倫歌。聲聲慢中的「冷冷清清慘慘戚戚」，正合這陰雨的天氣。詞，曲，歌，全屬上乘，天倫本為國產電影中最高尙的倫理片的主題歌，以前有郞毓秀　片很多，但茅女士歌來已入化境，而且這時大概怯塲的心理全消，故聲調婉轉傳神，把詞曲中每一個該有地表情，全透切的達出。</p>
<p>第四支是英文的，是創造曲中最精美的一節。第五支是一個有名的意文歌劇，輕鬆而動人，茅女士在微笑的表情下唱完。自始至終，無懈可擊。第七支是一支蘇伯特的德文小歌，第八是一個德文的歌劇，全劇唱完達十分鐘，且背詞流利，發音清楚正確是我在中國人歌西文中從未聽到過的。這像一個繁重的項目，自始至終達五十分鐘之久，而茅女士的　音却似越唱越響亮，越唱越傳神。</p>
<p>我以為一個歌唱者，非但要注意聲調，而且要注意讀詞和發音。因為歌曲不只是一串音符，而是一種傳情達意的工具。現在一般學唱者的洗弊是只注意前者而忽略了後者：所以我們往往能聽到的是很好的歌，但詞的內容，則全部含糊不清。茅愛立女士對詞的方面修養特高，無論中文，英文，意文，德文，發音咬字清瀝之至，我希望以後的學唱者都能效尤，則中國音樂界一定又能展開新的一頁。</p>
<p>在敎授們與茅女士握手道賀聲中，我悄悄地踏出了禮堂，重新踏上了泥濘的街頭。</p>
<h3>火的歡呼</h3>
<p>— 嚴克</p>
<p>無數條火龍，</p>
<p>無數顆流星，</p>
<p>舊的消滅，殞落：</p>
<p>新的誕生，重起。</p>
<p>消滅，殞落，</p>
<p>新生，重起，</p>
<p>它們把黑煤球染成血紅，</p>
<p>它們把冷煤球灼得沸燙。</p>
<p>滿爐通紅，</p>
<p>全爐皆火，</p>
<p>哄哄哄……</p>
<p>火在歡呼。</p>

<h3>西靑籃球甲組　華聯藥可穩得錦標　深望一本努力精神克底於成</h3>
<p>西靑　球甲組比賽，已屆後半部之形勢，華聯　在上週五克服東方，大　已隊，對於本屆　標，已如囊中物，爲華人隊揚眉吐氣；至堪慶賀？而歡乎華聯　之人材平均，戰術多變化，各個人技術，又卓絕一時，無怪其睥睨各隊，每戰必勝也。茲追評上週各戰：</p>
<p>東方勝華影。東方此戰以外埠各將未能趕到幸得焚慶咸吳國林二老將助陣，華影自錢旭滄歸來後，又見正常。故演來確有戰路，唯以個人技術之較差，不得不屆居人後。東方許文奎出手殊快，陳邦珍生疏之故，不能阻其活躍。上半時二十七對十三，　結果五十六對四十一，東方凱旋。</p>
<p>三輸棄權於巨人，觀衆又大吵，實屬無謂。然因此引起裁判與某君之突，幾至動手，幸各方力勸，始告平息，否西靑眞成多事之地矣。</p>
<p>同仁徬徨仁餘大勝</p>
<p>同仁今番張邦輪亦出席，並得某君為臨時指導，仁餘利用其快攻之特點，輙能乘人之隙，使對方驟不及防，無法抵禦，仁餘後衛卓國榮馬燦希非特勇不可比，抑且遠射有功夫，助前鋒之不足，乃良將也。同仁求勝心甚切，反致精神徬徨，演出失常，結束為六十三對三十三，出人意外之比數。</p>
<p>業餘賣力　挫華南</p>
<p>業餘兵將到齊，　幼良陳祥龍宋咎後等連袂蒞臨，為作戰以來之創舉，然華南為楚楚可觀之隊，劉家班新自姑蘇凱旋返申，聲勢自爾大盛，全隊氣足，守用人釘人，各司其職。攻有胡金桂無穴不入，獲分甚多，業餘雖均賣力，然聯絡生疏，格格不入，難挫華南鋒芒，相差尙遠，為六十八對三十五。</p>
<p>東方先放烟幕彈華聯　未所算</p>
<p>事前東方當局表示，各主將如包松圓許文奎王鏡瑚張少卿以事或病將不克出席。待西靑當局不允改期，全部偏師臨陣，以保持運動精神。然識者或謂此乃故放烟幕彈，使華聯藥精神鬆弛，而當時全師出戰，對方心理一緊張，此可以得不少便宜。蓋球員心理一起變化，甚易反常，所幸華聯　事前準備其全力，未稍再鬆弛之念，雖東方全體大將均臨陣，仍不能遏其氣燄也。而一塲龍爭虎鬥之戰確使觀衆嘆為觀止。中間唯王鏡瑚與瞿錫麟小起衝突，當即被判罰出，其他毫無缺點，美滿完成，殊足欣慰。此　雙方均取人釘人戰策，華聯藥以力足，聯絡佳，遠射有效，乃得勝利，東方敗在力不够，各自為政，射藍少把握。華聯藥以六十二對四十七，大敵已除，此後均屬康坦大道，不難以底於成。唯望嗣後一本過去努力精神，以顯冠軍雄姿，切勿存驕　之態，蓋錦標之外，尙須發揚精神道德。華聯健兒，謹守我言，殷望之至！</p>
<h3>華影健將缺席　為蒙納克擊潰</h3>
<p>華影隊以劉瓊拍戲，梅喜足傷，舒適手痛，高茫生另有要事。以此之故，實力大損。進攻無人指揮，實難乎取分。後防任亞偉尙見出色。然籃球比賽，獨木斷難支持火厦，紙見其個人表演而巳。蒙納克攻人之短，手下毫不留情，猖獗已甚，　聲響處，紀分牌上為四十八對十七，華影落後。</p>
<p>本週將舉行精彩友誼賽</p>
<p>西靑當局已邀請中靑西靑兩隊在二十六日（星期三）下午八時作友誼賽一塲，緣中靑以華聯藥為主，輔以馬燦希卓國榮余邭十等健將，實力甚强。西靑為巨人蒙納克之混合軍，亦見慄悍，一塲血戰，殊值得欣賞，七時起尙有插曲一塲，球隊尙在接洽，大致為同仁東方，亦好戲也。（必賢）</p>
<h3>怎樣才是一個　優良的乒乓裁判員　態度鎭靜嗓子響亮　眼快嘴快决斷要快</h3>
<p>— 陳霖笙</p>
<p>每個運動員要得到運動的益處，感到運動的興趣，就得要人人遵守運動規則。通常執行運動規則的就是裁判員，可見裁判員是怎樣的重要了。因為裁判員的重要，所以裁判員是需要相當的涵養，那麼怎樣才是一個優良的乒乓裁判員呢？現在就我十年來為百餘次以上的乒乓錦標賽所担任裁判得到的經騐，寫一些在下面，以供各界有志研究乒乓裁判的作為參考。</p>
<h3>善於處理　比賽塲面</h3>
<p>重要的乒乓比賽，觀賽的人盈千累萬裁對員太身略有誤會，固易橫生枝節，賽員過分認眞，也易生意外，就是觀衆也很容易惹起是非，處於這種比賽塲面。裁判員本身自然要刻刻謹愼，要明瞭自已責任的重大，使賽員不要過份注重勝負，而能明自比賽的眞意。同時耍熟悉衆　的心理而善於引導觀衆，比如大學盃决賽，參與的人自然以大學生最多，大學生是怎樣的脾氣。參加銀行盃賽的當然大部是銀行界，那麼這些行員最配什麼胃口，……能够明白觀衆心理，自己的一言一行，才能儘量减少刺激的舉動，這是使比賽秩序順利進行很要緊的一點</p>
<h3>態度鎭靜沒有私</h3>
<p>處理任何事情，多要有鎭靜的態度，在大庭廣衆之間，尤不應輕舉妄動，浮躁是最能敗事的。居心正直，才能沒有私心。能沒有私心，才能使各方面部滿意。裁判員是超然的第三者，不受任何人的牽制，他有判决的權限。臨時發生事情，也有當機立斷的權限，所以他的權限也是超越一切的。要是存心不正直，如何會有好結果，所以無論如何耍忠實的依照規則，要處處表露忠誠，語語含着熱忱，絕不疏忽，絕不傲慢。</p>
<h3>自始至終精神貫注</h3>
<p>因為裁判員的重要，因為裁判員的不易幹。所以常裁判員的必須要振作精神，全神貫注，不能有絲毫雜念，不能稍有茍且，無心的錯誤，也會影響富時秩序和一生的令譽的。要能够始終全神貫注，自己先得要有飽滿的精神，否則一上塲，是已先沒有精神。所以在賽前，裁判員是需要注意適常的休養。</p>
<h3>决斷要怏報吿要怏</h3>

<h3>Year of Increased Production and Year of Renovation</h3>
<p>On the first day of this year, New Year's Day, Chairman Wang emphasized in his address: "This year should be a year of general mobilization for the increased production movement." The Chairman said, "In order to mobilize manpower and resources to contribute to the Greater East Asia War, we must increase production to enrich materials, regulate prices, and improve people's livelihoods; we must especially protect productivity, cultivate productivity, and enhance productivity... Currently, the most urgent needs for national welfare and people's livelihood are clothing and food, so increased production work should start with agriculture and light industry first. Even with our current capabilities, if we cannot achieve sufficient clothing and food, we must combine the full strength of the government and the people to achieve a reasonable and possible solution to the clothing and food problem. We must at least gradually eliminate unnecessary and artificial suffering caused by layers of oppression for the general public, especially the producing masses, who are enduring the inevitable pain of the war period with hardship and endurance. The government should eliminate clichés, come up with practical plans, and do things calmly. The people should work together with all their strength and do things practically... I hope that all compatriots throughout the country will be consistent in knowledge and action, and achieve progress step by step."</p>
<p>In our New Year's Day editorial, we proposed: "This year is a year of renovation." We expect the government to lead the people to realize renovation in three aspects. The first is "political clarity," starting with adjusting personnel and establishing a good government. The second is "relieving the people's suffering," starting with increasing production and suppressing prices. The third is "practicing participation in the war." We must fully achieve the above two points before we can talk about practicing participation in the war. Otherwise, it will be just empty talk and will not make any practical contribution. Finally, we hope that the government will renovate itself! The people will renovate themselves, and at the same time urge the government to renovate! Allied countries will assist us in renovating!</p>
<p>The reason why we repeatedly quote the above two paragraphs is because tomorrow is the Lunar New Year. People's customs are deeply rooted, and everyone regards it as a day to get rid of the old and embrace the new. In fact, there is a new atmosphere. We will follow this fact and provide everyone with another opportunity to reflect.</p>
<p>"Year of Increased Production" and "Year of Renovation" are actually two slogans with the same meaning. Increased production is to relieve the people's suffering and contribute to cooperative operations. However, without the spirit of renovation first, and without achieving actual renovation, the goal of increased production cannot be achieved, and it is still just empty talk. The Chairman said, "The government should eliminate clichés, come up with practical plans, and do things calmly." This is also what we hope the government will renovate itself. Of course, "renovation" cannot be effective if only a few people in the government practice it. The leadership must set an example, and those above will influence those below. The government must be full of good people to ensure political clarity, and then the increased production plan can be implemented and successful. The Chairman also said, "The people should no longer stand by and shake their heads and sigh, but should work together with all their strength and do things practically." This is also what we hope the people will renovate themselves. Strictly speaking, the renovation of the people is mostly in a passive position. As long as there is a good government and practical plans to lead the people to do things calmly, then the people will definitely not stand by and will work together with all their strength and do things practically.</p>
<p>"Increased production" is the goal, and "renovation" is the means. We hope that this year we will achieve the goal of increased production, but it will be difficult to achieve results without renovation first. May the government and the public work together to practice renovation!</p>
<h3>Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is Purely Based on Moral Spirit. Prime Minister Tojo Answered Questions from Congressmen Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The House of Representatives General Assembly continued its meeting at 10:00 am on the 23rd. First, Congressman Yūsuke Tsurumi questioned foreign policy issues, followed by Prime Minister Tojo, who answered on the spot. The main questions and answers are recorded as follows: Tsurumi: "The first question I want the government to answer is about the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Cairo Declaration. The Cairo Declaration mentioned the various regions of Greater East Asia outside of Japan. This is nothing more than the ambition of the United Kingdom and the United States to expand their territories and the trick of appeasing Chongqing. Why do they still call these slogans the Atlantic Charter?" Prime Minister Tojo replied: "We have paid attention to how the enemy will react to the Greater East Asia Declaration. They initially remained silent, and then issued a fragmented and ambiguous declaration at the Cairo Conference. This clearly shows that the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has given them a great shock. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has no aggressive color, while the Cairo Declaration is a proclamation to divide up territory. What Japan is taking now is purely a policy based on moral spirit. For example, the independence of Burma and the Philippines, and the participation of natives in the Dutch East Indies and other regions in politics are all inviolable, bright, and righteous facts. Looking at India and other colonies under their control, and the black people problem in the United States, they have all become objects of exploitation. Therefore, I believe that the Cairo Declaration is nothing more than a declaration to enslave other nations."</p>
<p>There are Facts to Show the World That We are Charged with the Mission of Building a New Order.</p>
<p>Tsurumi asked, "How does the Greater East Asia Declaration compare to the Atlantic Charter?" Prime Minister Tojo replied: "The Greater East Asia Declaration is not only for the happiness of the Greater East Asia nations. Article 5 of the declaration says, 'To cultivate cordial relations with all nations and contribute to the progress of the world,' which is what it means. Also, the Greater East Asia Declaration is different from the empty declarations of freedom of the United Kingdom and the United States. The Greater East Asia Declaration is purely to eliminate aggression and exploitation in the world and abolish racial discrimination. Whether this can be achieved completely depends on the success or failure of the Greater East Asia War." Tsurumi asked, "The United Kingdom and the United States are not only sinking ships, but also shooting at Japanese fishing boats near the coast, and blindly bombing non-military cities. The New York Daily News even advocated releasing poison gas in Tokyo. What is the government's countermeasure against the enemy's inhuman war behavior?" Prime Minister Tojo replied, "The enemy's inhuman behavior is truly outrageous. Although there are many difficulties in the current war situation, Japan has never wanted to open up this situation with inhuman behavior. Japan's humane attitude can be easily understood based on the treatment of prisoners of war and the reports of certain representative countries. If we respond to the inhuman behavior of the United Kingdom and the United States with inhuman means, I think the whole world will become a world of barbarians. If the enemy consistently engages in inhuman acts, we will certainly punish them accordingly." Tsurumi asked, "Although the enemy has announced various post-war measures, should Japan hold a Japan-Germany-Italy conference and issue a declaration to announce the Axis powers' worldview to the world?" Prime Minister Tojo replied, "The relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy is not like the opportunistic alliance of the United Kingdom and the United States. The three countries not only have a common mission to build a new world order, but also have an inseparable relationship formed by the blood of soldiers. Therefore, there is no need to imitate the United Kingdom and the United States, whose interests are contrary. We have always acted with justice, which has already been shown to the world by the facts, and we will continue to adopt this attitude in the future."</p>
<h3>Rumors of Changes to the Chongqing Ambassador to the United States</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to Washington, the Chongqing Embassy in the United States announced on the 22nd that Ambassador Wei Dao-ming has left for the country to discuss important matters with Chiang Kai-shek. There are rumors that Jiang Tingfu will replace Wei Dao-ming as the ambassador to the United States.</p>
<h3>20 American Planes Shot Down Over Maungdaw. Japanese Planes Bomb New Ireland Heavily.</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - On the 20th at noon, Japanese army aircraft intercepted 30 American P40 fighter planes and Spitfire fighter squadrons that attacked the Japanese army. After repelling them over Maungdaw, they shot down 15 of them (6 of which were unconfirmed). In this battle, the Japanese army lost one plane and two planes did not return. Later, it was confirmed that the Japanese planes shot down a total of 20 American planes (10 of which were unconfirmed). The two Japanese planes that did not return also safely returned to base, so the Japanese side only suffered one loss. In addition, Japanese army planes later bombed the American army positions near Maungdaw, inflicting heavy damage, and bombed and sunk an enemy ship of 300 tons on the Naf River.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the Allied Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced on the 21st that Japanese air units launched a large-scale bombing of Allied military positions in the Arawe area and Cape Gloucester area of New Britain Island.</p>
<h3>Fierce Air Combat in the Pacific. 3,600 Enemy Planes Attacked in December.</h3>
<p>The number of enemy planes that attacked the Solomon Islands, Marshall Islands, New Guinea, Southwest Pacific, Indian Ocean, and other locations in December of last year is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Table of Enemy Plane Attacks</p>
<p>Region Number of Attacks Percentage</p>
<p>Solomon Islands 160 44.8</p>
<p>Marshall Islands 127 35.5</p>
<p>New Guinea 35 9.8</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific 21 5.8</p>
<p>Indian Ocean 8 3.2</p>
<p>Other 6 1.7</p>
<p>Total 357 100.0</p>
<p>The numbers include not only the key lines in the Solomon Islands and Marshall Islands, but also attacks on Wewak, Manokwari, Babo, Kogas, Fakfak, and Gaimina in New Guinea; Seriber, Ambon, Kupang in Timor Island, Hari, Aru Islands, Kai Islands, etc. in the Southwest Pacific; and Pang Island, etc. in the Southwest of India; as well as places such as Bangkok and Paramushiro.</p>
<p>Table of Enemy Planes</p>
<p>Region Number of Planes Percentage</p>
<p>Solomon Islands 2,126 or more 59.0</p>
<p>Marshall Islands 1,137 or more 31.5</p>
<p>New Guinea 187 or more 5.2</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific 81 or more 2.2</p>
<p>Indian Ocean 63 or more 1.7</p>
<p>Other 6 0.4</p>
<p>Total 3,602 or more 100.0</p>
<p>Looking at the number of attacks, enemy planes attacked a total of 357 times in December, of which 160 were in the Solomon Islands, accounting for 44.8% of the total. Looking at the number of planes that attacked, enemy planes attacked a total of 3,602 in December, of which 2,126 were in the Solomon Islands, accounting for 59%. The second is the Marshall Islands in the central Pacific. From this number, it can be seen that the enemy air force has placed its main force in the South Pacific and the central Pacific, desperately trying to break through the Japanese army's key lines. The number of planes and types of aircraft attacking in various directions are as follows:</p>
<p>Solomon Islands</p>
<p>Aircraft Type Number Percentage</p>
<p>Bomber B24 287 13.5</p>
<p>B25 146 6.8</p>
<p>Other Bombers 485 22.9</p>
<p>Fighter P3839 36 1.6</p>
<p>P40 25 1.1</p>
<p>F6FSBDTBF 166 or more 7.8</p>
<p>Other Fighters 547 or more 25.8</p>
<p>Large Aircraft 47 2.3</p>
<p>Medium Aircraft 82 3.8</p>
<p>Small Aircraft 100 4.7</p>
<p>Other 213 or more 5.8</p>
<p>Unknown 82 3.8</p>
<p>Total 2,126 or more 100.0</p>
<p>Marshall Islands</p>
<p>Bomber B24 284 25.0</p>
<p>25 13 1.1</p>
<p>Other Bombers 744 or more 22.4</p>
<p>Fighter P3940 42 3.7</p>
<p>Other Fighters 204 or more 17.8</p>
<p>Large Aircraft (including twin-engine) 263 23.1</p>
<p>Small Aircraft 33 or more 3.8</p>
<p>Other 43 3.7</p>
<p>Unknown 15 1.8</p>
<p>Total 1,137 or more 100.0</p>
<p>New Guinea</p>
<p>Bomber B.24 55 29.6</p>
<p>B.25 26 13.3</p>
<p>Four-Engine Bomber 6 or more 8.5</p>
<p>Fighter P.3940 51 26.9</p>
<p>Medium Aircraft 9 4.8</p>
<p>Small Aircraft 7 3.6</p>
<p>Unknown Aircraft 25 13.3</p>
<p>Total 189 or more 100.0</p>
<p>Since the landing on Mague, New Britain Island, on the 15th of last month, in the increasingly fierce Solomon battle line, of the 2,126 enemy planes that attacked in December, fighters accounted for 36%, a total of 774 or more. Bombers numbered 916, accounting for 43.2%. Long-range bomber unified type B24 accounted for about one-third of the bomber numbers, which is very noteworthy.</p>
<p>In the Marshall Islands, out of 1,137 planes, bombers numbered 537 or more, accounting for 48.1%; fighters numbered 246 or more, accounting for 21.5%. The ratio of fighter planes to bombers is approximately equal to that in the Solomon Islands. Also, large aircraft including twin engines account for 23.1% of the total, indicating that the base's power crossover is not as tight as in the Solomon Islands, reflecting the geographical characteristics.</p>
<p>In New Guinea, the ratio of B24s is also higher than in the previous two.</p>
<p>In the Southwest Pacific, the Indian Ocean, and other locations, most of the attacks in December were reconnaissance bombings, with a very small number of planes. (From the Asahi Newspaper of Western Japan on January 18)</p>

<h3>US War Goals Shaken and Japan's Diplomatic Lineup Strengthened. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Answers Questions from Yūsuke Tsurumi.</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The House of Representatives Budget Committee continued its meeting on the 23rd. During the session, Mr. Tsurumi raised questions on three issues: the shaking of US war goals, the internal disputes in the United States caused by the US presidential election, and the strengthening of Japan's diplomatic lineup. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu answered each of them as follows: "The shaking of US war goals is only natural, because they lack just war goals. The United States will take this opportunity to extend its hegemony in various parts of the world. War goals are the soul of war. A war without a soul cannot achieve final victory. I believe that the soul of the United States war is shaking today. They value materials and often entice the people with raising the standard of living, but on the other hand, even the Atlantic Charter is openly said not to apply to India. To cover up the contradictions in its new economic policy, it is engaged in a strategic war and a war to seize Asian colonies. The United States has no other war goals besides this. The US President's explanation of the war goals is a manifestation of his shaking. This is why the US President has had many contradictions in each meeting since the Cairo-Tehran Conference, which is only natural. He thoroughly understood the political situation in the Tehran Conference, but after returning to the United States, he seemed to have changed his attitude. This is not only due to the influence of the Cairo-Tehran Conference, but also because the war situation in the Pacific has fully dominated their minds. After the Italian coup, they made extremely optimistic remarks, and even issued a "peace theory" saying that the war was about to end. This "peace theory" and the American people's desire to end the war in the short term have a very strong influence. I think the US President's opinion changed after seeing the war situation in the Pacific and Europe. When he saw that the American people have always hoped for a short-term end to the war, he proposed national conscription to Congress. However, the US presidential election is about to arrive, so Roosevelt adopted this attitude. This shows that there is no unity in the United States, which is very different from Japan. In terms of military warfare, the unity of Japan is a major guarantee of final victory. Regarding diplomatic policy, I believe that explaining the spirit of justice in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration to the enemy and making them thoroughly understand Japan's just war goals is also a way to complete the war. We are making every effort to do so. There are three ways in which the American people disagree about the presidential election: opinions on the war, doubts about the war, and domestic election issues. But these are all internal affairs of the enemy country, which we can put in the secondary position. Our main task is to complete the war goal and make the enemy submit.</p>
<h3>Japan Decides to Allocate 500,000 Yuan to Subsidize the Development of Agricultural Land in Manchuria.</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government previously decided to allocate 500,000 yuan to the additional budget of the Greater East Asia Ministry to serve as the subsidy for the first year of developing agricultural land in Manchuria. The Manchurian government has recently decided to use its business subsidy together with the above-mentioned budget as an additional budget for Kangde Year 11. This additional budget will be used to develop several hectares of paddy fields in the Songhua River and East Liao River basins to establish a self-sufficient grain supply system between Japan and Manchuria. At the same time, it will also be used to develop three major agricultural lands in Guanligang, Sanjiang Province, and Kangde, which have been under implementation since the seventh year. The agricultural land development plan is expected to be completed in a short period of two years, so preparations and development are steadily progressing. The Songhua River is also a major event in the plan. Since the end of last year, the Ministry of Communications has been engaged in water control work in the East Liao River basin, and other projects will also be completed in a short period of two years starting from this year. The total area of developed agricultural land is more than twice the cultivated land area of Nagano Prefecture.</p>
<h3>The Situation of Yesterday's Japanese Budget Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Neither the plenary sessions of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives nor the special committees met on the 22nd. Only the House of Representatives Budget Committee continued to meet as usual. The meeting opened at 10:00 am. The following individuals successively raised questions about various budgets: Yūsuke Tsurumi on the diplomatic front, Mitsuzo Matsumura, Kuranosuke Oyama on the military supply front, Nobufusa Miyoshi on the food front, Masahide Kimura on the financial front, Soichiro Kita on the transportation front, Jotaro Kawakami on the labor front, Nagao Matsuyama on the aviation front, and Yoshimichi Iwai on the air defense front.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Underway 50 Miles From Rome. British and American Troops Landed in Nettuno.</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German authorities announced: The German troops on the Italian front engaged in fierce fighting with the Allied forces on the 22nd.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reported: After General Clark's attempt to break through to the Tyrrhenian coast failed, British and American troops launched a large-scale landing south and southwest of Rome to relieve their predicament in southern Italy. In the vast defensive operations on the fourth day, the German army not only prevented the enemy from breaking through towards Rome, but also pushed them back to the Gaddagliano Plain. On Friday, the German army regained the population entry points and several junctions of coastal mountain ridges. The British and American plan to cross the central part of Gaddagliano and Labidu was also frustrated. The US Fifth Army's breakthrough in Cassino has fallen into a dead end. And the British Eighth Army on the eastern wing of the Adriatic Sea did not dare to launch a large-scale offensive either. The fact that General Alexander landed in Nettuno, 50 miles south of Rome, and the landing to the north proves the superiority of the German army, but the German army withdrew from the city of Nettuno after a resolute resistance.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German authorities explained the situation of the Allied forces launching landing operations in southern Italy, saying: The Allied forces took advantage of the darkness on the morning of the 22nd and launched a landing south of Rome under the cover of artillery fire from both the sea and air. And established a bridgehead in the area between the mouth of the Ghibell River and Absolute Tono. At that time, the German troops immediately launched an attack, and the battle is now in full swing. According to the war situation on the Italian front, the situation has been deadlocked for several weeks, and the Allied forces' tactics can be described as "snail tactics." In the future, the Allied forces will launch a new landing operation to break the situation, which is expected by the German authorities.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Member Chen Bijun Visits Xuzhou and Receives a Warm Welcome From Chinese and Japanese Personnel.</h3>
<p>Nanjing (Central News Agency, Xuzhou) - Central Committee Member Chen Bijun recently came to Xuzhou to inspect the political party affairs and social situation, and received a warm welcome from military and political personnel from both China and Japan. She reviewed the military police and youth, personally visited various agencies, and expressed her respect for Governor Hao's diligence and impartiality, cooperation from allied countries, and the people and youth. She paid special attention to the improvement of people's livelihood, public health, and popular education in the area. She also visited the Allied Army Hospital and held a meeting with the Allied military corps commander in the reception room. The main points are as follows: (Corps Commander) "I was deeply pleased that the Chairman's surgery at the end of last year went well." (Central Committee Member Chen) "The Chairman was injured in an assassination attempt and underwent surgery twice with limited results. This time, the Allied military doctors performed the surgery and removed the bullet from his back in a very short time. I am amazed by the excellence of Japanese medicine. And with the good results, the Chairman's health has been improved, which is a cause for celebration for Sino-Japanese cooperation." (Hospital Director) "Last year, the Chairman visited our hospital in Xuzhou and gave us his condolences. Today, we have again received the condolences of Central Committee Member Chen, and the entire hospital is deeply grateful." After the talk, Central Committee Member Chen inspected the various wards and offered individual condolences and gifts. Central Committee Member Chen also gave gifts to the general troops in Xuzhou. Central Committee Member Chen's inspection time in Xuzhou was very short, but she left a deep impression on the military officers and people in the Xuzhou area. In particular, the central government decided to establish a Huaiwan Province in Suhuai. Central Committee Member Chen's visit to Xuzhou has had a great impact on the people, especially the encouragement of the youth. When Central Committee Member Chen returned to Nanjing, not only the military and political dignitaries, but also the general public and youth enthusiastically saw her off along the way.</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting on the Northern Route of the Eastern Front Continues.</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German Headquarters announced on the 22nd: The Soviet army launched an offensive between the Pripet River and the Belechina River. After fierce fighting, they were repelled by the German army. On the 21st, the German army repelled a strong Soviet force north of Nevel and blocked part of the Soviet army's salient. The Soviet army has repeatedly launched counterattacks on Lake Ilmen, but without success. Southwest of Leningrad, the Soviet army attempted to break through the German positions with strong infantry and tank units, but without success.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of German Troops Deployed to Bulgaria to Strengthen Defenses.</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a Budapest dispatch from a local newspaper, a large number of German reinforcements have arrived in Bulgaria.</p>
<h3>Argentine Consul Arrested in the West Indies. Argentine Government Issues Statement.</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to an announcement by the Argentine government, Argentine Consul Helmut was arrested on the island of Trinidad in the British West Indies while en route to Europe on orders.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Regarding the arrest of the Argentine consul in Trinidad, the British government has formally notified the Argentine Foreign Ministry that the reason is that the consul is suspected of espionage, but the truth has not been explained. In addition to dismissing Helmut on the 22nd, the Argentine government issued the following statement: Regarding the activities of foreign intelligence agencies in Argentina during the war, the government will conduct a thorough investigation based on various facts. The government will take all necessary measures to crack down on all activities that run counter to Argentina's foreign policy.</p>
<h3>The Newly Appointed Anhui Governor Luo Holds Inauguration Ceremony, Various Department Heads and Bureau Chiefs Take Office</h3>
<p>Bengbu, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The newly appointed Governor of Anhui Province, Mr. Luo Junqiang, arrived at the governor's office on the morning of the 22nd at 10:00 AM to take over his duties. At 11:00 AM, the inauguration ceremony was held, attended by approximately 500 representatives from various Chinese and Japanese circles, as well as key officials from the provincial government's various departments and bureaus. Following the formal ceremony, Mr. Luo delivered an address, outlining the principles of "fairness, stability, and gradual progress" as the guiding principles for promoting provincial governance. Subsequently, Colonel Sakuraba, Consul General Morita, Commander Tanigawa, and others delivered congratulatory speeches. He then received reporters and gave a talk, emphasizing ensuring public security and enhancing production as key focuses of provincial governance. A luncheon was held for Chinese and Japanese guests. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, the newly appointed Director of the Department of Political Affairs, Hu Zewu, Director of the Department of Construction, Yang Youchun, Director of the Security Department, Guo Erzhen, Director of the Police Affairs Department, Man Qiwei, Director of the Economic Bureau, Wang Hanzhang, and Director of the Food Bureau, Peng Wangshi, and others respectively took over their duties and convened meetings with staff. The Director of the Rural Clearing Affairs Bureau, Cai Yingshun, will travel to Wuhu tomorrow to assume his new post.</p>
<p>Another telegram: Peng Wangshi, Director of the Anhui Food Bureau, stated in an interview with reporters on the 23rd that he felt deeply the great responsibility of being appointed to the Anhui Food Bureau. He would adhere to the central government's overall food policy and follow the governor's instructions in his work. Under the wartime system, food is the lifeblood of the nation, and the Chairman has repeatedly declared this year to be a year of increased production. Therefore, striving to increase production will be the primary goal. Southern Anhui is a rice-producing area, while northern Anhui has abundant production of coarse grains. However, rice prices in Anhui Province are high, and the people's food supply is difficult. Therefore, stabilizing the people's food supply should be the second goal, so that we can work together to complete the rear area work for the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>The Discomfort in the Rear Areas of Britain and America</h3>
<p>America</p>
<p>Like any warring nation, America is also seeking a reserve army of manpower among students and women. Here, democracy is not needed. With dictatorial power in his right hand and waving the "Shield of Ensuring the American Way of Enjoyment" with his left, Roosevelt has succeeded in driving students to the war effort and women into factories. This forced transformation has disrupted the American way of life and caused various problems at home, as repeatedly reported by foreign news agencies. The actual situation of manpower mobilization mentioned by Kisuo is summarized below:</p>
<p>Students</p>
<p>1.  Middle School Students: Mobilize students for agricultural labor. This is a given during summer vacation. During busy farming seasons, classes are temporarily suspended so middle school students can work in the fields. The authorities are remarkably dedicated to military training, especially the dissemination of aviation knowledge. This can be seen from the fundamental changes in the national middle school curriculum.</p>
<p>2.  University and Higher Vocational School Students: Now, American universities and vocational schools have all been transformed into reserve officer training schools. In the army, 120 schools are designated to establish reserve officer training institutions, providing 12 to 48 weeks of education, training 150,000 reserve officers annually. In addition, students aged 18 to 26 who are enrolled in schools not mentioned above are appointed as officer candidates and given specialized aviation education during their studies. After graduation, they are called up and appointed as reserve air force officers.</p>
<p>In the navy, a naval reserve officer system has been established. Dozens of universities have adopted this system, recruiting volunteers among enrolled students. After four months of preliminary training, they receive three months of education at officer schools or designated universities, and then they are appointed as reserve ensigns. In addition, reserve officers for the Marine Corps and Coast Guard are selected from vocational school students.</p>
<p>Furthermore, both the army and navy offer draft deferments and various preferential treatments to students who volunteer for aviation service, appealing to their American-style vanity in an effort to supplement aviation personnel.</p>
<p>Women</p>
<p>The increase in the quantity of military strength naturally leads to a shortage of labor. One way to compensate for this shortage is to mobilize women. One-third of America's labor force must rely on women. The US government not only implements policies to their liking to win their favor, but also does not hesitate to resort to coercive mobilization when necessary to make American women submit.</p>
<p>Among American women of productive age, from 18 to 49, there are a total of 33 million, of whom 16.5 million are said to be able to work. According to a 1943 survey, there are 16 million female workers, meaning women's mobilization has almost reached its limit. In May 1942, the female employment rate in the entire American industry was 14.6%, which increased to 27.2% in May of the following year, almost doubling. The extent to which female workers have replaced male workers can be seen from this. In particular, in aircraft factories, one-third of the employees are women, and by the end of 1943, it is said to have exceeded half. Compared with only 2% of female employees before the war, it is clear that American women have made considerable efforts in war production.</p>
<p>American women not only enter factories, but also join the military. The army and navy mobilization plan at the end of 1943 was for 10.8 million people, and the shortage of soldiers was filled by the women's auxiliary corps. As of July 20 last year, there were 65,000 American women soldiers, according to the authorities' publicity. It is said that it will be expanded to 600,000 in the future. Furthermore, the nature of their jobs is gradually approaching that of men, from railway and automobile employees, firefighters, and welders to even slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>National Life The living standard of the American people is very high, so it can be lowered to a considerable extent. It is difficult to directly compare the living conditions of the people based solely on superficial figures. However, the food situation is quite pressing, which is a fact. The absorption of labor by the large military and military-related industries is bound to cause a shortage of agricultural labor, which will lead to a considerable crisis in terms of food at the end of this year. On October 20 last year, US Secretary of Agriculture Wickard stated: "The US rural labor force is the most lacking, and other machinery is also quite scarce, and increased food production will fall into crisis."</p>
<p>1.  Clothing: Restrictions on short boots, limited to three pairs per person per year in February last year, reduced to two pairs in October; socks, from October of the same year, limited to nine pairs per person per year for women over 15 years old (mostly made of rayon). Men's and women's clothing is also simplified due to the reduction of domestic inventory, and a rationing system may be implemented soon. In addition, due to the shortage of coal and pulp, newspapers have also reduced the number of pages. Furthermore, efforts are being made to collect old socks, torn clothes, etc., as raw materials for recycling. Therefore, the confidence of America, which relies solely on the quantity of materials, is slowly wavering. We should not overemphasize this internal anxiety and wavering, but at least we can recognize the opponent's weaknesses.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the national life of Britain can be said to have reached its limit. Although the national life of the United States is more difficult than before, the hardship in America is like the hardship of a child, with some leeway. On the other hand, the hardship in Britain comes after everything has been mobilized to the extreme, just like a rubber band stretched to its limit. Since Britain entered the war two years and three months earlier than the United States, and has been subjected to quite severe bombings, and because most materials other than coal cannot be self-sufficient, they must continue to engage in extremely costly wars. One can easily imagine how deeply the national life has been oppressed.</p>
<p>Financial Situation</p>
<p>Compared with the previous year's budget, Britain's budget for the past year increased by only 150 million pounds. Compared with the situation of increasing by about 1 billion pounds every year since the outbreak of this war, this must be regarded as evidence that Britain's productivity has reached its limit, that is, manpower, materials, and equipment have reached saturation, and there is no room for further investment. Furthermore, direct taxes seem to have reached their limit. Therefore, in addition to natural increases, the increase relies solely on indirect taxes. Therefore, in addition to natural increases, the increase relies solely on indirect taxes, which is putting gradual pressure on national consumption funds, and the standard of living is 20% lower than in 1938. However, the British government's countermeasures for general prices, especially the cost of living, have been successful. Since 1941, they have been generally stable, and the increase in the cost of living index has not exceeded 30% compared with before the war. The nation's training of the people has also fully exerted its effect in the financial aspect. Although wartime expenditures are huge, there is no fear of malignant inflation today. However, regardless of the fact that wages have been raised by more than 60%, the increasing number of strikes demanding wage increases shows that the economic situation in Britain has reached the point where it is at its end, and there is no way to go. The following are the latest price indexes in the UK for reference.</p>
<p>Living materials: Next, how about the problem of essential living materials, which are the most important for inspiring and maintaining national morale? The first is the food problem. Generally, people are quite optimistic about Britain's food situation? They think that Britain's food problem is the worst and most difficult among the warring countries. However, in fact, it cannot be regarded as being so dire. During the last world war, German submarines showed their power and tightly blockaded the British mainland, so that the food reserves in the British headquarters were only enough for a few days, and the situation was critical for a while. Afterwards, in view of this painful experience, Britain pondered and researched countermeasures since before this war, and strengthened storage. After the start of the war, it worked harder to increase food production, limit consumption, and ensure wheel-in. As a result, we have to frankly admit that they are maintaining a better standard than other European countries. However, when carrying out the North African operation, the Sicilian operation, etc., due to the shortage of ships, the shipping from the United States and other places has been drastically reduced. The British government also hurriedly warned the people with food shortages, so in the future, if they carry out the large-scale operations they are calling for to establish a second European front, its impact will naturally be deeply reflected in the relationship between food supply and demand. The British government will probably be in a situation where it has to issue another warning. According to the Ministry of Agriculture's announcement last year, the British headquarters can supply two-thirds of the necessary food. However, the degree of reliance on foreign countries for important materials is still very large and is easily controlled by shipping problems. If the activities of German submarines remain relatively inactive as they have been recently, Britain should have no difficulty maintaining its current level of food self-sufficiency. However, German submarines have been refitted since last autumn, and their offensive power has been greatly enhanced, so the future of Britain is certainly not optimistic.</p>
<p>The restriction on food consumption began with the restriction on bacon, ham, butter, and sugar on January 8, 1940, and then gradually expanded the scope of consumption restrictions. However, important foods such as bread, potatoes, fish, and vegetables have not yet been subject to rationing. This can be regarded as evidence that there is still some leeway in the food supply and demand relationship.</p>
<p>As for clothing, the coupon system has been adopted since June 1, 1941. The first year was 66 points per person for twelve months, and the second year was reduced to 60 points for fifteen months (48 points per year). Since September of last year, the third year has begun, and the result seems to be a further 10% reduction. On the whole, the first year was about half of the normal consumption, the second year was reduced to two-thirds, and the third year was reduced by another 10%, so the supply and demand of textile products can be regarded as quite tight. As for fuel, cold Britain needs a lot of coal, but due to the shortage of labor, the output has been considerably reduced. Although the British government has repeatedly tried to implement a rationing system, it has not been able to do so due to opposition from the parliament, and it will fall into a more difficult situation in the future.</p>
<p>Housing problem</p>
<p>Due to the uneven distribution of the population caused by the prosperity of military industries, the damage to houses caused by air raids (3 million households by the end of the previous year), and the restriction on construction due to the lack of building materials, the housing problem is also quite serious.</p>
<p>In addition, the shortage of rubber, leather, and metals has restricted the supply of daily necessities, which is obviously quite inconvenient for the general public. The shortage of paper is particularly significant; it is said that the allocation of newsprint is less than one-fifth of that before the war. Soap has also been rationed since February of the previous year, and it is still felt to be in short supply. (Translated by Ji from the Mainichi Shimbun of January 8)</p>

<h3>Regulating the Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>— Wang De</p>
<p>Recently, everything has been rising in price, and books are no exception. A thin book can cost 40 or 50 yuan, but this is not comparable to firewood, rice, oil, and salt, which are essential for life. Moreover, rice, coal, oil, and sugar are already rationed. However, books and magazines are also spiritual food and have a great impact on a country's culture, so there is a greater need to regulate the publishing industry.</p>
<p>If you can visit a few Japanese bookstores, you will surely be amazed. A very thick publication costs only 70 or 80 cents, and the content is very substantial, with many varieties. Even fishing has a fishing magazine. As for general books, they are also extremely cheap, well-bound, and on good paper. New editions are published from time to time. The Japanese publishing industry is so developed and unaffected by the war because it is regulated. They attach great importance to cultural work during wartime.</p>
<p>In order to promote the development of our country's culture and promote wartime awareness, I hope that the authorities will quickly establish a regulatory organization for the publishing industry. I would like to offer a few points of opinion based on my limited observations, as follows:</p>
<p>Paper is the main raw material for publications. Currently, paper prices are soaring. One reason is that the production volume has decreased, and scarcity makes things expensive. The other reason is that paper is allowed to be bought and sold freely, making it a bargaining chip for speculation and a target for hoarding. Therefore, if there is a regulatory agency, it should reward paper mills for increasing production, find ways to unblock the sources of papermaking raw materials, and purchase all paper goods and new products together for allocation.</p>
<p>Although many publications are currently published, the content is either romantic or empty and meaningless so-called "reimbursement culture." It can be said that there are no proper books. Major bookstores are only selling their inventory. If a regulatory agency is established and a solution is found for raw materials, the cost will be reduced. Then, all publications can be adjusted and cracked down on. Some can be merged, and the publication of truly valuable books can be encouraged.</p>
<p>Printing is also a large part of the cost of publishing. Currently, the wages of typesetters are higher than the manuscript fees of authors who rack their brains, so the living conditions of printing workers should be reasonably resolved, and not just by increasing wages. Printing raw materials should also be regulated and allocated together, and excessive exploitation by printing merchants should be prevented by setting strict and fair price limits.</p>
<p>The living conditions of literati are as difficult as those of primary school teachers. How can there be good articles to read? Those with power have already changed careers. Therefore, if other costs are reduced, manuscript fees must be increased to an appropriate level, and incentive measures should be established to encourage authors who have made contributions. Only then can the level of the publishing industry be improved and the content be enriched.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for distribution, Japan already has a distribution association that implements unified wholesale. This can crack down on exploitation by intermediaries. As for book prices, a fair price can be set by adding a fixed profit to the cost.</p>
<p>In this way, publishers will have a guarantee and will no longer see publishing as a daunting task. Our readers can also have good books to read and cheap books to buy. As the saying goes, "Knowing books leads to understanding principles." Not only that, but also our country's culture depends on development and progress. I hope that the regulatory agency for the publishing industry can be established as soon as possible to save publishing, save authors, and save readers.</p>
<h3>Boiled Water Price, Reduce Sale by 5 Cents Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Boiled Water Trade Association, in order to comply with the authorities' intentions, is pleased to announce that all 619 boiled water stores in the One, Eight, Nanshi, and Huxi Four Districts will uniformly reduce the price of each ladle of boiled water from one yuan to five cents from tomorrow, the Lunar New Year's Day. All boiled water stores must not violate this, otherwise anyone can report them. As for boiled water stores north of the Suzhou River, the selling price will be reduced after cheap coal is purchased.</p>
<h3>China-Japan Cultural Research Institute to Expand Work, Yoshida's Collected Works Published in Japanese</h3>
<p>Since its establishment last autumn, the China-Japan Cultural Research Institute has been actively working and has successively translated and published several series of books, such as Modern Japanese History, Economic Japan, and Yoshida Toyo's Collected Works. Recently, the Japanese version of Yoshida Toyo's Collected Works has been compiled and published, priced at 20 yuan. All of the above books are published by Shen Bao. In addition, the Great East Asia New Situation Wall Map is being compiled and will be published soon. This map is the first map published in the Chinese publishing industry after the Greater East Asia War. There are also more than 60 detailed maps of the Greater East Asia region, which are being compiled. Several famous Japanese works on culture and economy that have been translated, as well as Mr. Su Sen's translation of Zeng Guofan in Japanese, are all awaiting printing. The listening area has received assistance from Mr. Sheng Yutong, and it is preparing to expand its work this year, organize a board of directors, and hire Mr. Yoshida Toyo as the director to preside over research and publication and China-Japan cultural exchange work.</p>
<h3>Lunar New Year's Eve, Intensify Security</h3>
<p>Today (the 24th) is Lunar New Year's Eve. The First Police Bureau of this city, in view of the fact that various money houses, companies, factories, and shops are handling year-end closings and frequently receiving and delivering funds, has, as usual, intensified security in the district. Additional sentries have been dispatched to key traffic intersections, and the entire police brigade has been dispatched to patrol all quiet streets and alleys in the district. Those with suspicious behavior will be strictly questioned and their citizen identification cards will be checked to prevent criminals from taking advantage of the opportunity and to ensure local security. In addition, this security will continue to be implemented during the Lunar New Year holiday, so police officers will have to take turns to work at the bureau.</p>
<h3>Retail Donations in the Eighth District, Deadline to Settle by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The Eighth District Office recently stipulated various measures for the collection and payment of the two-cent donation and the special consumption donation, which are excerpted as follows: All two-cent retail donations and ten-percent special donations collected by merchants before January 15 of this year shall be settled and all reporting forms shall be submitted and cancelled by January 30. Those who fail to do so will be penalized. Those who have completed the above procedures should immediately obtain the consumption tax reporting form for January. The income from dance tickets in dance halls will still be handled according to the original method. The special consumption tax is collected once a month. Those who sell ordinary goods or luxury goods exclusively, or both, shall keep various necessary books. In addition to indicating the amount of tax payable on the invoice, each special consumption tax collection firm shall also attach a receipt for the same amount, otherwise it will be regarded as embezzling tax money. The rest is omitted.</p>
<h3>Two Bureau Chiefs Police Training, Third Graduation Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Police Brigade of the Second Police Bureau conducted training for all its chiefs and police officers, totaling more than 200 people. The training period has now been completed. A graduation ceremony was held yesterday morning at the Police Brigade on Lujiabang Road in Nanshi. Bureau Chief Fu Ying personally attended and gave instructions. After the formal ceremony, Brigade Commander Wang Tingdong reported on the training process. Bureau Chief Kugawa and others then gave instructions, with many words of encouragement. The ceremony did not end until about 12:00 noon.</p>
<h3>Japanese Language Teachers' Training Course - Second Session Closing Ceremony</h3>
<p>The third session of the Japanese language teachers' training course for primary and secondary schools, organized by the Municipal Education Bureau, held its closing ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 23rd of this month at the Shanghai Japanese Language School on Xiaoshadu Road. Mr. Lin Jian Jiongan, the president of the association, served as chairman. Mr. Cui Jingyu, the section chief representing Mayor Chen, Mr. Nonoyama, the section chief of the Japanese Embassy, Mr. Takayama, the investigator, and others were present. First, the chairman delivered an opening speech, encouraging all the students attending the lectures. Then, the representative of Mayor Chen and Mr. Nonoyama gave speeches in turn. The student representatives, Ren Yongjian and Zheng Yanling, responded. After a group photo at around 12:00 PM, the meeting adjourned. Afterwards, all the lecturers and students who attended the lectures held a symposium. President Lin Jian personally participated. All the students expressed their thoughts and opinions in Japanese, showing exceptional enthusiasm. The meeting concluded with great joy at 1:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Plan for Aircraft Donation – Progressively Completed</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Citizens' Aircraft Donation Movement Committee has been sparing no effort in launching a donation drive to purchase aircraft. All parties have responded to the call, actively contributing, and the donations have been continuous. In addition to the Peking opera community, represented by Zhang Shankun, pledging 5 million yuan, and the film industry, represented by Feng Jie of the China Film Company, pledging 6 million yuan, it is now learned that the city's dance hall industry representatives all visited the committee yesterday. They expressed their patriotism and their unwillingness to lag behind, expressing their eagerness to contribute. As for the fundraising methods and targets, Zheng Weixian, a leading figure in the industry, will be responsible for planning. A concrete decision is expected soon. The committee has recently printed artistic slogans and selected propaganda personnel to distribute them to various roads, mobilizing the people to strive forward. The standing committee decided yesterday to take a three-day holiday from the 25th to the 27th of this month, as it coincides with the Spring Festival, when all sectors are closed as usual, to give rest to the staff. Work will resume as usual on the 28th. It is also heard that the preliminary work plan is scheduled to be completed by the end of February this year, at which time it can be presented to the government.</p>

<h3>Grand Comedy "Double Happiness at the Door" Grand Premiere Tomorrow – Charity Performance to Aid Education – New Year's Program More Humorous than "Gentleman on the Beam"</h3>
<p>The second play for charity, "Gentleman on the Beam", also successfully concluded. The results of the performance were not only more enthusiastic than "Gone with the Wind", but also opened up an unprecedented grand occasion in the drama world in the past year.</p>
<p>Now, Kugan's new spring program "Double Happiness at the Door" will also be performed at the Paris Grand Theater from tomorrow (the first day of Jiashen New Year).</p>
<p>Kugan's original third program was "Robot", but in order to suit the New Year's performance and cater to the tastes of the general audience, they specially selected the grand comedy "Double Happiness at the Door", written by Yao Ke and directed by Hu Xiang'an. The play depicts two young couples who agree to elope, but unexpectedly meet in an inn on the way. The owner of the inn is a kind-hearted matchmaker who sets a trap and cleverly uses tricks to confuse the two couples, resulting in many incredible and funny scenes. In the end, they each get what they love and reconcile. The cast includes Bai Wen, Shen Min, Shangguan Yunzhu, Wang Jun, Bai Mu, etc., who are the most accomplished actors in the drama world. They have even more impressive achievements in "Double Happiness at the Door". Countless viewers who have seen "Gentleman on the Beam" will surely be even more satisfied in "Double Happiness at the Door".</p>
<h3>Important Correction</h3>
<p>In yesterday's news on page 3 of this newspaper, "Teams Dispatched to Salvage Corpses from Ping Mountain Yunyang Ferry", the seventh line: "More than a hundred refugees were present the day after the accident..." The character "口" was incorrectly printed as "日". We hereby correct this.</p>
<h3>Don't Forget to Help Students During the Spring Festival</h3>
<p>Since the sixth session of the Readers' Scholarship Fund of this newspaper began, it has been enthusiastically supported by readers. Although it is still far from the target of 3 million yuan, the daily statistics are rising steadily, relying on the enthusiasm of readers, which is infinitely admirable. From the donations of readers, it can be observed that many people have saved the costs of festive banquets and transferred them to help students, such as the example of Mr. Wang Zhenchuan and the brothers of Mr. Li Shifu celebrating their mother's birthday and saving banquet expenses to help students. Asking guests and friends to restrain their own appetites can subsidize the studies of many poor students for half a year. Such a kind deed with profound implications, I believe all guests and friends will be happy to do it!</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the Spring Festival. Everyone inevitably has the custom of gift-giving and feasting. We absolutely do not criticize this as inappropriate, but we hope that readers will think of the more meaningful student aid movement when giving gifts and feasting. Save some from it to donate to the scholarship fund, not considering the amount too small to do. Every little helps, and we welcome both large and small amounts equally.</p>
<p>The four days from today to the 27th are our holiday period, but we have specially assigned personnel to accept readers' donations for the scholarship fund. Please hand them in at the General Affairs Office of this newspaper. During this period, we deeply hope that readers will save money to help students and reach the target of 3 million yuan as soon as possible.</p>
<p>May you all have a happy Spring Festival! Don't forget to help students!</p>

<h3>Candle Raw Material Panic - Has Been Alleviated</h3>
<p>The price of candles has soared in recent months due to the shortage of raw materials. According to custom, candles are used even more during the end of the year and the beginning of the new year. It has been learned that the panic over this raw material has now been alleviated. This is because the Oil and Grain Professional Committee recently consulted with the authorities and decided to transport some raw materials from production areas in the south to the north.</p>

<h3>Navy by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang - Military Class (3)</h3>
<p>The future is already decided. This time, it's an unwavering determination. Even if the Sakura Bird erupts and the Jiaotu River flows backward, this ambition will not change -</p>
<p>"If you have decided so, that's fine... Father and Zhenichiro have both been drafted into the army, and there is no one in the navy..." Mother agreed very readily. She even added that back in the Meiji 17th year, there was a great-uncle who served as a sailor -</p>
<p>Now that things have come to this, there is no need to hide it any longer, so Zhenren also announced it to Longfu. At that time, Jifu was so happy that he danced and pranced, and the two of them swore to become naval officers together and share life and death. Longfu bought two framed photos of Marshal Togo, who passed away on May 30th of that year, and gave one to Zhenren.</p>
<p>Until now, Zhenren worshiped Marshal Togo as a local elder statesman, but now he has added another layer of meaning, and at the same time he is an old senior of the navy he aspires to. However, his understanding of Marshal Togo is not very deep, it is only to the extent of (Old Togo, great...). He only knew the true value of the Marshal much later.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, the distant cause of his ambition to join the navy was reading "Anecdotes of the Anglo-British War" on that stormy day, and the near cause was when the military observation group went to Edajima and heard the speech of the duty officer in white uniform. "Gentlemen, you probably all know the glorious emblem on the bow of our country's warships. Why do all our warships have a sixteen-petal chrysanthemum crest - that is to show that the Japanese Navy is the Emperor's Navy. Both legally and in fact, this is the case. This is something everyone must know, but many people do not know it. Moreover, there are many people who do not know that the builder of the Japanese Navy is also a myth, which is really..." The officer in white uniform recounted the history of the Japanese Navy being built in the Meiji era, with the foundation of the Great Navy being laid in the Meiji era. In the military parade in the first year of Meiji, there were only six warships gathered at Osaka Port, with a total tonnage of 2,452 tons - by the time of the last naval review held by Emperor Meiji in Kobe forty years later, the number of ships had reached 123, with a total tonnage of 444,460 tons. The youths were surprised to hear such a large difference in numbers.</p>
<p>A great navy was built during the reign of Emperor Meiji. This is all thanks to the great achievements of Emperor Meiji. To give an example, in the 25th year of Meiji, when the Ministry of the Navy submitted the budget for building two battleships, one cruiser, and one dispatch vessel to the parliament, the situation of rejection was very strong. Emperor Meiji was deeply saddened at the time. In the years that followed, he saved 300,000 yen in court expenses every year and donated it to the Japanese Navy..."</p>
<p>The voice of the officer in white uniform suddenly stopped. That voice still remains in Zhenren's eardrums.</p>

<h3>Advising Business People to Promote the Spirit of Mutual Assistance and Jointly Shoulder the Responsibility of Helping Students</h3>
<p>— Bao Ying</p>
<p>Now that the times are still difficult, the livelihood of the majority of people is even more painful. It is impossible to count the number of children from poor families who cannot continue their education. This is not only the misfortune of the outstanding students, but also something that powerful people in society should feel guilty about. I have not read many books and am in the business world. I have deep sympathy for young people who have lost their education and often think that I should do my best to help them.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao initiated the student aid movement, and the achievements in each session are remarkable. I regret that I have not done my best. However, in view of the fact that since the incident, there are many business people with accumulated wealth, why is the donation of student aid money not generous and enthusiastic? At this time of turmoil, the tragic lives of most compatriots can be understood without saying. Who caused the tragedy? I think that the speculation and waves of merchants also cannot escape their blame! However, things in the world are unpredictable, and money is ultimately an external thing. I respectfully advise business people with 120,000 enthusiasm that in this situation of weathering the storm together, it is a great opportunity to promote the spirit of human mutual assistance. Rather than saving excess wealth to leave to future generations, it is better to do more good deeds and benefit the people. The saying goes, "Take from the surplus and supplement the insufficiency." Taking from my surplus and supplementing the insufficiency of others is harmless to me and beneficial to others. Why not do it? In these difficult times, it can be said to be the most fortunate thing to have the ability to help others, and the goal of helping others should be to help ambitious and outstanding young people. Donating student aid money and cultivating promising talents in order to serve society, revive the country, and benefit the people is surely a good thing. I serve in the business community and am ashamed of my meager efforts and lack of contribution to society. I now plan to raise funds to donate to student aid. As soon as the Lunar New Year arrives, I will send it to the Shen Bao authorities. I respectfully advise powerful people in the business community to eliminate the idea of only seeking profit, inspire the spirit of doing good and following virtue, and jointly support the Shen Bao Readers' Student Aid Fund movement.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Fellow Association - Enthusiastically Helping Students</h3>
<p>The Changzhou Shanghai Fellow Association was established last spring by Mr. Sheng You, Tao Xiquan, Xu Guanqun, You Chunxin and other gentlemen who raised funds. It is heard that Mr. Wen Junlan is in charge of the association's affairs, and it is developing day by day. It has organized medical treatment, medicine distribution, poverty relief, and elderly care one by one, and pays special attention to cultivating young people. It has specially entrusted the Shen Xin and Xin Xin newspapers to handle scholarship loans. At the beginning of this academic year, it was decided to handle it by itself. It stipulates that each household with Wujin registration has one place. Registration starts from now. Those with school grades above 70 points are qualified. The office is located at Chengmin Wenshang College, No. 226 Beijing Road.</p>
<h3>Stomach and Intestine Hospital - Preferential Treatment for the Poor</h3>
<p>Dr. Song Daren of the Shanghai Weiyang Hospital sent a letter yesterday, saying: Your newspaper's medical service department has a wide range of services. It is impossible to refuse to help with stomach and intestinal diseases. If the investigation confirms that they are poor, they can be referred for free diagnosis and treatment, and all inspection fees can be waived. A minimum amount of drug costs will be charged, and free drugs will be given to the extremely poor without additional charges. The hospital is located at No. 33 Xinhua Garden, Jing'an Temple.</p>

<h3>A Record of Fighting Bravely Undersea</h3>
<p>He yelled, "Damn it! Get me bullets!..." and the infantryman who was reduced to one hand and one leg on the battlefield, roared and cursed wildly in his narrow, grey prison last night, until he finally breathed his last. Seeing this tragic sight and hearing his cries, someone said to me, "Even his heroic actions in sinking enemy ships did not move him, and even the relentless pressure from enemy planes and ships, which numbed his nerves and forced him to fight, never made him forget his mission to break through." These were the words of a submarine captain, who had returned to the 〇〇 base this morning after carrying out a mission to break through to New Guinea. He was deeply exhausted, his eyes sunken into their sockets, but still faintly shining. The term "breakthrough" is a secret term used by these iron whale warriors, meaning to use submarines to carry out supply and transport missions. "The war in New Guinea is us fighting against the enemy's steel and aircraft with our own flesh and blood," said an army unit commander who had recently traveled on a breakthrough submarine with resentment. But in reality, it's not just New Guinea, but ラモア·ラエ·フィンシハハン as well, isn't it? What follows is a record of the underwater breakthrough to New Guinea, as experienced by the main protagonist behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The Mosquitoes' Attack</p>
<p>"Damn it, the fleas and mosquitoes are here to harass us again tonight!" This was the tall, bearded captain, taking off his binoculars, looking up at the sky, and shouting loudly. In the sky, a crescent moon like the eyebrow of a large Buddha face hung askew, thinly covered by sand-like white clouds, making the moon goddess appear even more delicate. Carrying the important mission of transporting supplies to the 〇〇 base, the 〇〇 submarine charged straight ahead, valiantly advancing through the silver waves in the hazy moonlight.</p>
<p>The lookout on the bridge, with his hands gripping the binoculars and his eyes fixed, looked like a statue carved by a famous artisan. Suddenly, the lookout of a certain submarine shouted in a cracked voice, "Torpedo boat twenty degrees to the left!" The echo of this voice was still lingering in our ears when the patrol leader suddenly issued a deafening command: "Dive!" Immediately, the emergency bell inside the submarine rang piercingly. The "fleas" that the captain was talking about referred to enemy torpedoes. In this area, since it was a moonlit night, the fleas were rampant, even in the dark. The fleas were quite domineering. Inside the submarine, which was submerged in the South China Sea to avoid depth charges, although the time was relatively short, everyone felt as if they were being steamed in a pressure cooker, not only sweating profusely but also unable to breathe, making it truly unbearable. The submarine was packed full of supplies, not to mention that there were also 〇〇 tons of ammunition, food, medicine, etc. on the deck, and there were also 〇〇 infantrymen with us, so there was practically no space. The pungent smell and the inability to move made everyone inside the submarine as tense as a drawn bow.</p>
<p>This difficult time finally passed. It seemed that the enemy torpedo boat had moved away, so the order to "Surface" was transmitted through the speaking tube. However, after the fleas left, the mosquitoes, the airplanes, came again. Suddenly, the surfaced submarine saw red lights like shooting stars in the binoculars. Thus, the emergency bell rang continuously again in the night. There was no talk of sleeping, and it was impossible even to sit down. Under the control of many annoying enemy planes and ships, the submarine had to deliver the goods on the specified date, which was the hardship of submarine transport. From the captain to the soldiers, once they left the base, they could not even blink an eye, and could only sleep after returning.</p>
<p>Surfacing Before the Enemy</p>
<p>The coconut and mangrove forests were scorched by gunfire and bullets. The captain, gazing at the shore of 〇〇 Island through the periscope, seemed to be lost in thought. The submarine had reached the designated landing point. Fortunately, there were no signs of enemy aircraft in the air. "Surface!" "Make landfall!" "Open the hatches fore and aft!" These series of commands were transmitted through the speaking tube. The stevedores had already jumped onto the deck, and through the small hatch that only allowed one person to pass through, they dragged out ammunition, medicine, and other supplies in order. This work was incredibly fast and agile. Otherwise, there would be many potential dangers, and no one could say for sure where and when enemy aircraft would come. At the same time, no one could say for sure where the fleas were watching us intently.</p>
<p>Then, except for one's own base, the hatch should never be opened in principle. But now, opening the hatch like this was practically opening the hatch in front of the enemy. Therefore, every minute and every second had to be seized for unloading. Everything was entrusted to the lookout, while everyone else was busy moving cargo. The ammunition and medicine that would take more than ten hours to load at one's own base were unloaded here in just half an hour. Only a body of steel could withstand such intense work. From this, one can see the greatness of the spirit of submarine warriors.</p>
<p>Returning as a Hospital Ship</p>
<p>After sending off the spirited army soldiers, the submarine now welcomed the wounded and sick soldiers. Soldiers with broken legs and broken arms, soldiers plagued by malignant malaria, were lowered one by one through the hatch. All were seriously injured and seriously ill, not knowing whether they would live or die. Their eyes were sunken deeply, their hair was disheveled, and they looked very unsightly. Some were even covered in eczema, with yellow pus constantly flowing, and small maggots filled each small pustule. Although they wore something called clothes, they were actually tattered uniforms soaked in blood, sweat, dirt, moisture, heat, and gunpowder, and everyone just stayed where they were placed, without even stretching or lifting their heads.</p>
<p>As the young naval captain was trying to provide emergency treatment, the submarine had already submerged and was sailing, with food sacks swaying on the deck. Thus, the lives of 〇〇 people could be guaranteed for 〇 days. Now, only one task remained, which was to safely transport the wounded and sick soldiers back to base. However, this was not an easy task. The loudly crying army soldiers did not allow the sailors who had finished their shift to take a nap, so the sailors had to continue to perform the duties of medical staff. Not only did they have to serve meals, but they also had to help with excretion. They looked like mothers carrying their sick children, sometimes holding them in their arms and feeding them fruit juice. They were extremely annoyed and exhausted. They wore oil-stained and blood-soaked protective clothing, their faces covered in black grime that was indistinguishable from mud, and their bloodshot eyes were too painful to look at people. Even with such eyes, they still had to be troubled to stand lookout on the bridge for 〇 hours.</p>
<p>The heart of the iron whale encouraged and scolded us: "Don't let the wounded and sick soldiers die!" At the same time, the iron whale hurried incessantly, carrying its wounded comrades who were in pain and unable to move, all the way to the base. All the wounded and sick soldiers, carried on the backs of the sailors, sobbed, complained, and vowed to come back stronger.</p>
<p>Once again, they shouted "Hurry! Hurry!" and their hands and feet moved ceaselessly, breaking through to 〇〇. The storm was extremely fierce. The vicinity was pitch black, with no visibility. The sound of guns and cannons mingled with the rain. Then, in the distance, they occasionally saw red and green tracer bullets. This meant that our army was launching a night raid in 〇〇. Just then, a lookout shouted, "Airplane ninety degrees to the left!" We were still unloading cargo. No sooner said than done, following the order to "Dive immediately!", the hatches fore and aft were closed, and the submarine immediately submerged and sped away. The workers left on deck swam in the dark sea until the plane left.</p>
<p>Suffering for Rice</p>
<p>Among the army wounded received that night, an officer said to our captain, "I am Major 〇〇, battalion commander of the 〇〇 unit, please take special care of me!" Looking at this person, he was wearing tattered military uniform, his shoulder straps had long been lost, and he was holding a saber in his left hand, which was the only thing that proved he was an officer. When the battalion commander saw the fragrant rice cooked by the cook being brought before him, he couldn't help but say, "Ah, it's rice!" Then his eyes filled with tears and he began to cry. Everyone who saw this scene lowered their heads and shed tears as well.</p>
<p>"Only give the wounded who cannot move two rice balls. These are only rice balls the size of a child's fist. Because their hands cannot turn, the wounded can only lie down in the forest after eating. Those who can move drink rice porridge. Because the rice bags have been soaked in seawater, the rice has swollen up, so porridge is made with this rice. A fifteen-day ration of rice porridge is stretched to last forty days. If we think about how difficult it is for the submarine to transport supplies, even eating thin rice porridge is appropriate." There were only 〇〇 nautical miles left to the 〇〇 base. The storm was still very severe.</p>
<p>From within this storm, an enemy destroyer suddenly emerged. Depth charges rang out one after another above the rapidly diving submarine. Three hours, five hours... The enemy's pressure was very persistent and stubborn. Finally, after 〇〇 hours, the discharge of the storage batteries gradually increased, and as a result, they would all be used up soon. Because this could not be known by the wounded soldiers, the captain forced a smile, but in his heart, he was secretly lamenting. Day was about to break, and they finally escaped this ordeal.</p>
<p>Spoils of War</p>
<p>"Enemy transport fleet of 〇 ships escorted by ten cruisers and five destroyers is heading north. Seems to be attempting a landing at 〇〇!" It was evening on a certain day of a certain month, when the radioman was sending this telegram, having just completed the transport work and while the submarine was still submerged.</p>
<p>The captain issued commands into the speaking tube with a dog-like barking sound: "Course 〇〇 degrees!" "Full speed ahead!"—At this time, the storm seemed about to shake the heavens, the dark sea was rushing by, and visibility was poor. All that could be seen were the waves being broken by the submarine's bow and the white wakes parting on both sides of the stern. In everyone's heart was the hesitant desire to attack the enemy.</p>
<p>"Win or lose, let the army brothers see our skills." Gradually approaching the enemy, it seemed that our own planes had already opened fire on the enemy. The submarine, just 〇 kilometers away from the enemy, advanced with all its might. The torpedoes were already prepared. Following the commands "Angle to the right", "Ready", "Fire", the torpedoes were released one by one. After 〇 minutes and 〇 seconds, the sound of silence was broken, and the sound of hitting and exploding, "Boom boom boom", hurt the eardrums. Everyone smiled broadly today, having not achieved such results in months.</p>
<p>The enemy, under our combined water and air attack, some sank, and some were badly damaged. In the end, they were completely defeated. When they returned triumphantly to their original base, the coconut trees at the base seemed especially pleasing. Tomorrow, there would be more work of transporting food and ammunition, this time to 〇〇. Tonight, they would surely have a sweet dream! (Translated by Da Lu from the Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun, December 31st)</p>

<h3>A Freed Person</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>Qian Zhishan was the oldest in the H Girls' Middle School dormitory, so everyone called her "Big Sister." In addition, her worldly experience was indeed much richer than the others, so she deserved the title.</p>
<p>Currently, she was busy with something. From the tone of her voice when she spoke to her friends, it was clear that it was very important: "This concerns my happiness for the rest of my life. I must liberate myself! Whoever stops me is my enemy!" Whenever she had time, she would talk to her classmates about herself, and she always got more and more excited as she spoke, as if she could never finish telling her story:</p>
<p>"I have a very bad temper. I've been very opinionated since I was a child. None of my brothers even went to school, but I insisted on going to school because I knew that only by studying could I talk about freedom and liberation. I still feel this way. I have always had my goal, and no one can stop me. As long as something is in accordance with the truth, I will do it regardless of everything! For example..." She always gave many examples, criticizing herself with a half-concealed sense of pride.</p>
<p>The result of handling this important matter, it is said, was still her victory. One day, a fat man came to see her. He was no more than twenty years old, with small eyes embedded in a swollen face, a wide nose, and a big mouth. He was wrapped in a straight Western suit that resembled an olive pit. She cheerfully greeted him and warmly pulled him inside:</p>
<p>"Just sit in our dormitory for a while!" She generously turned to her classmates:</p>
<p>"Okay, let me introduce you. This is Mr. Kong, a friend of mine." Then she introduced them one by one.</p>
<p>"So what if it is! Are you afraid of you children?" She looked at the fat man, twisting her head and acting coy and experienced.</p>
<p>Then the fat man generously treated them to candy, and they went out together.</p>
<p>The next day, Big Sister had a lot more to say:</p>
<p>"To be serious, my love with him has also gone through a lot of twists and turns! I was engaged to a man named Wang since I was a child. He's a useless guy. Although he's a college student, he's still pretty good-looking, but he's just a bumpkin. When I'm with him, I just feel like he doesn't understand anything. At the same time, I was already in love with someone named Kong, so I had to break off the engagement. I negotiated with my mother and brother for a long time, and I was willing to sacrifice family affection! Mr. Kong even used a lot of money! Actually, spending a little money is nothing. It's always happy to be free."</p>
<p>"So what's so special about this Mr. Kong?" Xiao Ming asked.</p>
<p>"He's very modern. He knows everything. He's very young, but he's already the manager of several gauze shops. And his thinking is very new. He's also just divorced from his wife. He's also against old traditions and advocates liberation."</p>
<p>"He spent a lot of money for love and liberation!" she said again.</p>
<p>"Please don't be angry, but this Mr. Kong is not very handsome!" Xiao Ming was still tactless.</p>
<p>"Ha! You're still kids. Is just talking about good looks real love? The greatness of our love lies in this! And he's not a woman.</p>
<p>"Standing on the basis of mutual liberation is the most meaningful love!"</p>
<p>"We have all been liberated from our families, and we are comrades! Not yielding to the old forces, this is the true nature of youth!" Her tone was strong enough, like a warrior, making everyone admire her.</p>
<p>Two months later, Qian Zhishan got married. Six months later, she had a child, which was a double happiness and very fulfilling. It's just that Mr. Kong's business was not very good because he spent a lot of money buying gauze.</p>
<p>"Zhishan! The child has been sick for the past two days. Don't play mahjong today!"</p>
<p>"No! You shouldn't order me around! Do you understand women's liberation? Do you want me to stay home and watch the children all day? You yourself pretend to be for business, but you go dancing and watching plays freely. Men and women are equal! We need complete liberation! Can you control me?"</p>
<p>The man didn't say anything anymore. Yes, she was a person who had freed herself, and she could no longer be bound.</p>
<p>So the man went out, the woman went to the living room to play mahjong, the nanny took the child for a walk, and the aunt cooked in the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Kong, your Mr. Kong is really good. My enemy at home makes a fuss and doesn't allow me to play mahjong!" said Mrs. Zhang next door.</p>
<p>"Now that women have all been liberated from their families, how can he still control me? The meaning of liberation is that no one at home can control anyone!"</p>
<p>"You're so lucky. You and your husband both understand liberation. A pair of liberated people have organized a happy little family!" The three people at the table were all envious of her. She was also very proud of herself.</p>
<h3>Songs of Two Days - Listening to the Vocal Music Semester Exams at the National Music Academy</h3>
<p>— Ke Jun</p>
<p>It was a morning of drizzling rain. I wandered aimlessly along the streets, soaked by the raindrops. From one road to another, I had already moved from the western district to the central district.</p>
<p>Near the corner of Avenue Road and Carter Road, I was fascinated by a song. The singing came from that old, red Western-style building. That building was the National Music Academy, which I had been very familiar with a year ago. It must be time for the semester exams again! My heart couldn't help but stir: I was worried about how to spend this rainy morning, but God had arranged such a chance encounter for me.</p>
<p>The small auditorium was already packed, despite the rain. A crowd was still standing at the door. It was almost eleven o'clock, and the program had already started. So I asked a gentleman next to me to borrow two programs, and quietly stood in the corridor, listening as hard as I could to the notes that came through the cracks in the crowd. When my eyes reached the end of the program, I almost wanted to jump up with joy: there were two long senior-level exam pieces, and most of the songs were my favorite and most familiar ones: the final examinee was Ms. Mao Aili. I had long heard that the Music Academy had a famous soprano, but I had never had the opportunity to appreciate her performance. Today, I could effortlessly hear her in such a chance encounter, which was truly a special gift from God.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I arrived too late! By this time, the tenth examinee had finished singing, and a few listeners were leaving the auditorium. The doorway loosened up a bit, and I took the opportunity to squeeze into the exam venue. The eleventh was a tenor. The high notes were indeed very moving, but the low notes were very vague, and the lyrics were unclear. His attitude and posture were not good, and he really needed improvement. The twelfth tenor's tone color was acceptable, but his technical skills were not yet sufficient. The thirteenth was a tenor surnamed Yu, whose opera was of a superior quality, but unfortunately, there were a few cracked notes. The fourteenth was a bass surnamed Qi. I was surprised by the unusual names of these singers: Yu, Qi, Mao, perhaps they were rare talents and must have had rare surnames! The bass's tone color was excellent. If he put in more effort in the technical aspects, his future would be unlimited. The fifteenth was a soprano named Li Tian, but for some reason she was absent from the senior-level exam. Then Ms. Mao took the stage!</p>
<p>The first song was an exercise, a very moving waltz, but for some reason, maybe because I had too high expectations, or maybe Mao Aili was a little nervous, her singing was not as sonorous as I had hoped. The second and third songs were Chinese songs, "Slow, Slow Tune" and "Ode to Family". The "cold, cold, desolate, bleak" in "Slow, Slow Tune" perfectly matched this rainy weather. The lyrics, the music, and the singing were all excellent. "Ode to Family" was originally the theme song of the noblest ethical film in Chinese cinema. Lang Yuxiu had recorded many records of the piece, but Ms. Mao's singing had reached a perfect state. At this time, she had probably completely eliminated her stage fright, so her tone was tactful and vivid, and she thoroughly conveyed every expression that the lyrics and music should have.</p>
<p>The fourth song was in English and was the most exquisite section of the creation. The fifth song was a famous Italian opera, light and moving. Ms. Mao finished singing with a smiling expression. From beginning to end, it was impeccable. The seventh song was a small German song by Schubert, and the eighth was a German opera. She sang the entire opera, which lasted ten minutes, fluently reciting the lyrics and clearly and correctly pronouncing the words, which I had never heard before in Chinese people singing Western songs. This was like a heavy project, lasting fifty minutes from beginning to end, but Ms. Mao's tone seemed to get louder and louder, and more and more vivid.</p>
<p>I believe that a singer should not only pay attention to the tone, but also to the reading of the lyrics and the pronunciation of the words. Because a song is not just a string of notes, but a tool for conveying emotions and meanings. Nowadays, the common flaw of singers is that they only pay attention to the former and neglect the latter. So what we often hear are very good songs, but the content of the lyrics is completely unclear. Ms. Mao Aili has a particularly high level of cultivation in terms of lyrics. Whether in Chinese, English, Italian, or German, her pronunciation and articulation were extremely clear. I hope that future singers can emulate her, and the Chinese music scene will surely usher in a new chapter.</p>
<p>Amidst the professors' handshakes and congratulations to Ms. Mao, I quietly stepped out of the auditorium and back onto the muddy streets.</p>

<h3>West Qing Basketball League A Group: Hua Lian Yao Ke Secures the Championship - Earnestly Hope for Consistent Effort to Achieve Success</h3>
<p>The West Qing Basketball League A Group competition has reached the second half. Hua Lian defeated Dong Fang last Friday, and the championship is practically in their grasp, bringing glory to the Chinese team. Is this not something to celebrate? Hua Lian's players have well-rounded skills, versatile tactics, and excellent individual techniques, so it is no wonder that they look down on other teams and win every game. Here is a review of last week's games:</p>
<p>Dong Fang Defeats Hua Ying. Dong Fang was fortunate to have veteran players Fen Qingxian and Wu Guolin assisting them because their players from other locations could not make it in time. After Qian Xucang returned, Hua Ying returned to form. Therefore, the game was strategically sound, but due to the relatively poor individual skills, they had to concede defeat. Dong Fang's Xu Wenkui was exceptionally quick, and Chen Bangzhen could not stop his activity due to inexperience. The score was 27 to 13 in the first half, and the final result was 56 to 41, with Dong Fang winning.</p>
<p>San Shu forfeited to Ju Ren, and the audience caused a great commotion, which was truly unnecessary. However, this led to a clash between the referee and a certain gentleman, almost resulting in physical violence. Fortunately, various parties persuaded them to stop, or else West Qing would have become a place of much trouble.</p>
<p>Tong Ren is Confused, Ren Yu Wins by a Large Margin</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun also attended for Tong Ren this time, and a certain gentleman served as a temporary advisor. Ren Yu used its fast-break characteristics to take advantage of the opponent's openings, catching them off guard and unable to defend. Ren Yu's guards, Zhuo Guorong and Ma Canxi, were not only unparalleled in courage but also had excellent long-range shooting skills, compensating for the forwards' shortcomings. Tong Ren was eager to win, but their spirits were confused, and their performance was abnormal. The final score was 63 to 33, an unexpected result.</p>
<p>Amateur Players Exert Themselves, Hua Nan is Defeated</p>
<p>The amateur players arrived with their full roster, with You Youliang, Chen Xianglong, Song Jiuhou, and others appearing together, which was an unprecedented move since the beginning of the competition. However, Hua Nan is a respectable team. The Liu family team had just returned from Suzhou victorious, and their momentum was naturally high. The whole team had enough energy, used man-to-man defense, and each person performed their duties. Hu Jingui's attacks were relentless, scoring many points. Although the amateur players exerted themselves, their coordination was rusty and incompatible, making it difficult to blunt Hua Nan's sharp edge. The difference was still far, with the score being 68 to 35.</p>
<p>Dong Fang First Throws a Smokescreen, Hua Lian Was Prepared</p>
<p>Before the game, the Dong Fang authorities stated that key players such as Bao Songyuan, Xu Wenkui, Wang Jinghu, and Zhang Shaoqing would be unable to attend due to matters or illness. When the West Qing authorities refused to reschedule, they deployed a partial team to maintain sportsmanship. However, some knowledgeable people said that this was a deliberate smokescreen to relax Hua Lian's spirits so that they could launch a full-force attack and put psychological pressure on the opponent, which could bring many advantages. When the players' psychology changes, it is easy to become abnormal. Fortunately, Hua Lian prepared for their full strength in advance and did not relax at all. Even though all of Dong Fang's generals were present, they still could not stop their momentum. The fierce battle was truly a sight to behold. The only minor conflict was between Wang Jinghu and Qu Xilin, who were immediately penalized. Other than that, it was a perfect ending, which is very gratifying. Both sides adopted man-to-man tactics, and Hua Lian Yao Ke won because of its strength, good coordination, and effective long-range shooting. Dong Fang lost due to insufficient strength, acting independently, and lacking confidence in shooting. Hua Lian Yao Ke won 62 to 47, eliminating a major enemy. From now on, the road will be smooth, and it will not be difficult to achieve success. It is hoped that they will continue their past efforts to show the heroic posture of the champion and not be complacent. In addition to the championship, it is also necessary to promote the spirit and morality. Hua Lian athletes, abide by my words, and I earnestly hope for it!</p>
<h3>Hua Ying's Key Players Absent, Defeated by Monaco</h3>
<p>Hua Ying's Liu Qiong was filming, Mei Xizu was injured, Shu Shi's hand hurt, and Gao Mangsheng had other important matters. For this reason, their strength was greatly reduced. No one was directing the offense, making it difficult to score points. Ren Yawei's defense was still outstanding. However, in basketball, one tree cannot support a building. It was just his individual performance. Monaco attacked the opponent's weaknesses without mercy and were very rampant. With a loud sound, the score was 48 to 17, with Hua Ying falling behind.</p>
<p>A Wonderful Friendship Game Will Be Held This Week</p>
<p>The West Qing authorities have invited the Zhong Qing and West Qing teams to play a friendly game at 8:00 PM on Wednesday, the 26th. Zhong Qing is mainly composed of Hua Lian Yao Ke, supplemented by strong players such as Ma Canxi, Zhuo Guorong, and Yu Yushi, making them very strong. West Qing is a mixed army of Ju Ren and Monaco, which is also fierce. The bloody battle is worth watching. There will also be an interlude game starting at 7:00 PM. The teams are still being negotiated, but it will likely be Tong Ren and Dong Fang, which is also a good show. (Bi Xian)</p>
<h3>How to Be an Excellent Table Tennis Referee - Calm Attitude, Loud Voice, Quick Eyes and Mouth, Quick Decisions</h3>
<p>— Chen Linsheng</p>
<p>For every athlete to gain the benefits of sports and feel the interest in sports, everyone must abide by the sports rules. Usually, it is the referees who enforce the sports rules, which shows how important referees are. Because referees are important, they need to have considerable self-cultivation. So, how can one be an excellent table tennis referee? Now, based on my experience as a referee in more than a hundred table tennis championships over the past ten years, I will write some things below for reference by people from all walks of life who aspire to study table tennis refereeing.</p>
<h3>Good at Handling the Competition Scene</h3>
<p>In important table tennis competitions, there are thousands of spectators. If the referee makes a slight mistake, it is easy to cause complications. If the players are too serious, it is also easy to cause accidents. Even the audience can easily cause disputes. In this kind of competition scene, the referees themselves must naturally be cautious at all times and understand the importance of their responsibilities so that the players do not pay too much attention to winning or losing but can understand the true meaning of the competition. At the same time, they must be familiar with the psychology of the public and be good at guiding the audience. For example, in the university cup final, most of the participants are naturally college students, so what kind of temperament do college students have? Most of the participants in the bank cup are naturally from the banking industry, so what kind of taste do these bank employees have? If you can understand the psychology of the audience, your words and deeds can minimize stimulating actions as much as possible. This is a very important point to ensure the smooth progress of the competition order.</p>
<h3>Calm Attitude, No Selfishness</h3>
<p>When dealing with anything, you must have a calm attitude. You should not act rashly in public, as rashness is the most likely to lead to failure. Only with integrity can you have no selfishness. Only without selfishness can you satisfy all parties. The referee is a detached third party who is not controlled by anyone. He has the authority to make judgments. He also has the authority to make decisive decisions when something happens temporarily. Therefore, his authority also transcends everything. If you are not honest, how can you have good results? Therefore, you must faithfully follow the rules in any case, and you must show sincerity everywhere, with enthusiasm in your words, never neglecting, and never being arrogant.</p>
<h3>Concentrated Spirit from Beginning to End</h3>
<p>Because the referee is important and because the referee is not easy to do, the standing referee must be energetic and focused, without any distractions, and without any perfunctoriness. Unintentional mistakes can also affect the current order and lifetime reputation. To be able to concentrate throughout, you must first have a full spirit, otherwise, you will have no energy when you get on the court. Therefore, before the game, the referee needs to pay attention to appropriate rest.</p>
<h3>Quick Decisions, Quick Reports</h3>
<p>To see quickly and carefully, the referee's full spirit is almost concentrated on seeing. But the referee's seeing is different from the audience's seeing. You cannot stare blankly, and you cannot be fascinated by wonderful balls and forget your duties. After watching carefully, make a quick decision based on the practiced rules, followed by a loud and clear report. This concentrates your attention and attracts everyone's attention.</p>
<h3>Experience Must Be Rich and Solid</h3>
<p>"Knowing the world clearly is learning, and being proficient in human relationships is writing." In other words, experience is above all else. Refereeing is not easy, and you must have rich experience. Therefore, refereeing is not easy, and you must hone your skills through more practice.</p>
<h3>Stand in the Appropriate Position</h3>
<p>The referee should stand three feet away from the table tennis table. Because being too close to the table hinders the players' performance and the audience's view, and it is also difficult for you to see the back and forth of the ball. In short, the referee should pay attention to more than just these points. The above are just the most important points.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Talk About the Sports World</h3>
<p>The Mermaid has decided to temporarily leave Shanghai and is in the process of obtaining a passport to Hong Kong. It is said that her return to Shanghai will be in the bright spring, when her mother and children will also come to enjoy the joy of family life. According to the Mermaid, due to seasonal reasons, she was unable to present a wonderful performance. Hopefully, she will return next spring to show her "Mermaid" skills to satisfy the desires of the fish fans here.</p>
<p>Xuan Aihou, the owner of Tong Ren, is the manager of the investigation department of Shanghai Bank. What he hopes for his nephews and nieces is to strengthen their physique first, and then strive for the evolution of their ball skills. He often gives earnest instructions. Therefore, the spirit of the Xuan family team's performance is the best among all teams.</p>
<p>The Hua Ying basketball team has accepted the invitation of the Wuxi Sports Association to go to Wuxi on New Year's Day to play a charity game.</p>
<p>The ball games in the banking industry were once very popular, but they have been quiet for a long time. Recently, Lu Yunsheng and Zhu Xieqing, managers of China Trade Bank, have been strongly promoting them. They first started to organize a China Trade mini-football team, which played a friendly game with China and achieved good results. I hope that other banks and firms will follow suit and use their leisure time to strengthen their bodies and minds. (Skinny Reporter)</p>
